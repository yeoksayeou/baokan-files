    Qinxian, Fushan and Other Counties
    Launch "Support Cadres and Cherish the People" Campaign
    [This newspaper, Taiyue, 25th dispatch] According to reports from correspondents in Qinxian, Fushan, Yuanqu, Changzi, and Jiyuan counties, many villages have universally launched the "Support Cadres and Cherish the People" campaign to promote rural solidarity. In some villages of Qinxian, the relationship between the masses and cadres had not been resolved in time, and reactionary forces took advantage of the situation. Some cadres were wrongly struggled against. Qingxiu Village put forward the slogan of cadres and masses "walking face to face." Cadres made self-criticisms and apologized to the masses, and the masses recalled the merits of the cadres, and they were once again closely united. In Changzi, the cadres' acting as sole agents (包办代替) caused the movement to temporarily decline. The leadership, seeing this phenomenon, educated the cadres to examine themselves and admit their mistakes to the masses. Each village held a "family affairs meeting" to check on each other. The head of Nan Zhangzhen (南张镇) said painfully, "In the past, I only blamed the masses for not being conscious, but now I realize that it was my own lack of democracy." Finally, he repeatedly sought everyone's opinions, and the masses said, "You have already stated your shortcomings, what else can't we get over?" Truly achieving frankness and sincerity. The masses of Tongshan Town (同善镇) in Yuanqu raised opinions to the cadres, asking the cadres to examine their own shortcomings and correct themselves. This transformed many cadres, and the movement deepened as a result.

    沁县浮山等县
    开展拥干爱民运动
    【本报太岳二十五日电】据沁（县）、浮（山）、垣（曲）、长（子）、济（源）等县通讯员的报导，不少村庄普遍展开了“拥干爱民”运动，以促进农村大团结。沁县某些村庄过去未能及时解决群众与干部关系，因之反动势力钻了空子，有些干部被误斗了，青修村提出干部与群众“面对面走”的口号，干部检讨向群众道歉，群众追忆干部的功绩重新亲切的团结起来。长子因干部的包办代替，使运动暂时消沉，领导上看到此种现象，便教育干部检讨自己，并向群众承认错误，各庄皆开“家务会议”互相检查。南张镇长很痛心的说：“过去光是埋怨群众不觉悟，现在才知道是自己的不民主。”最后他再三征求大家意见，群众说：“你的缺点自己都说了，咱们还有什么过不去？”真正达到了开诚相见。垣曲同善镇群众向干部提意见，要干部检讨自己缺点改正自己。这样改造了许多干部，随之运动深入一步。
