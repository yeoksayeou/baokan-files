    Sudian South Street Breaks Through Backwardness
    Hidden Landlords Are All Brought Down
    [This Dispatch From Our Changzhi Correspondent] In the in-depth review of the emancipation movement in Sudian, Second District, the continued discovery of landlords' schemes of fake family divisions and fake struggles. In this thorough review of emancipation in Sudian South Street, the masses had not taken action at all. After research by district and village cadres, the Guan, Du, Dong, Wang, and Lian families, five major surnames, held a dominant position in South Street, with a total of eighty-four households with other surnames. In the great movement last spring, led by the Guan family, a major landlord, they used feudal clan relationships to establish a secret agreement of mutual non-struggle. They used methods such as fake family divisions to create false opinions, allowing members of the same clan to receive a small amount of benefit, while the majority of farmers with other surnames were still suppressed and unable to speak. For this reason, the leadership proposed "If we cannot eliminate backwardness, we cannot eliminate feudalism," mobilizing cadres to go deep among the masses of other surnames to understand the situation. Immediately, it was discovered that poor peasant Zhao Qiuze had worked as a long-term laborer for twenty years because he borrowed thirty yuan from the landlord Guan Zhenquan, and was also forced to sell two mu of garden land, so hungry that his whole family begged for food, and still now lacked food and clothing. When district cadres visited his home and asked why he couldn't cover himself with a quilt or change into cotton clothes for the winter, his whole family finally painfully told the story of how Guan Zhenquan had taken his land, exposing the fact that Guan Zhenquan and the Du, Dong, Wang, and Lian families colluded with each other, falsely created struggles to hide land, and had recently engaged in large-scale rent collection. After Zhao Qiuze's thinking was straightened out, he went to mobilize the deceived farmers of various surnames to settle accounts with the landlords. The whole village then moved towards a thorough high tide of emancipation struggle. From the Guan Zhenquan family alone, the masses raised one hundred and fifty cases of debt and rent interest issues, clearing out one hundred and twenty mu of land and forty mu of garden land.

    苏店南街突破落后
    隐蔽地主全被斗垮
    【本报长治讯】二区苏店在深入翻身大检查中，继续发现地主假分家假斗争阴谋。苏店南街在这次彻底翻身检查中，群众丝毫没有行动起来。经区村干部研究，南街有关、杜、董、王、连五姓大户占统治地位，共有杂姓八十四户。在去春大运动中，以关姓大地主为首，利用封建宗族关系，建立互不斗争秘密协定。与以假分家造假意见等方式，让同族人得到少许利益，而多数杂姓农民仍被压的不能吭气。为此领导上提出“消灭不了落后就消灭不了封建”，动员干部到杂姓群众中深入了解。当即发现贫农赵秋则因借地主关珍全三十元钱给做了二十年长工，还被迫卖了二亩园地，饿得全家讨饭，直到现在还少吃没穿。区干部到他家中访问时，提起他过冬为啥盖不上被子换不上棉衣，他全家终于沉痛的说出了关珍全夺去他的土地的经过，揭露了关珍全和杜、董、王、连几家地主互相包庇、假造斗争隐蔽土地，最近还在大斗刮租的事实。赵秋则打通思想后，就去动员各姓被欺骗农民向地主算账。全村遂走向彻底翻身斗争高潮。只关珍全一家，群众即向他提出债务租息问题一百五十件，清算出土地一百二十亩，园地四十亩。
