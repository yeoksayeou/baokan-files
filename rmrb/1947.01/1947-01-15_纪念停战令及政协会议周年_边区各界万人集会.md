　　Border Region Holds Mass Rally of Ten Thousand People to Commemorate the Anniversary of the Ceasefire Order and the Political Consultative Conference
　　Vice Chairman Rong and others gave speeches, condemning Chiang Kai-shek for breaking his promises, violating the agreement, and launching a civil war, calling on the military and civilians of the entire region to continue their efforts to crush the Chiang army's offensive.
　　[Special Dispatch from This Newspaper] On the 13th, more than ten thousand military and civilians from all walks of life in the Border Region held a rally at the location of the Border Government to commemorate the anniversary of the Ceasefire Order and the Political Consultative Conference.
　　At 11:30 AM, after the national flag was raised and cannons were fired to open the meeting, Vice Chairman Rong Wusheng began to speak. He said: "On this day last year, in order to resolutely implement the ceasefire order, the Taiyue troops had already entered the city of Quwo, but resolutely withdrew from the city. In the Hebei-Shandong-Henan region, our troops had already climbed the city walls of Liaocheng, but also resolutely withdrew. In order to implement the troop reduction plan, the first batch of demobilized soldiers in our region reached more than 75,000. In order to implement the transportation agreement, we transferred a large number of cadres to establish railway bureaus such as Pinghan, Daoqing, and the southern section of Tongpu, and recruited more than 1,500 workers in Handan alone to repair roads. We also carefully and conscientiously completed the election of National Assembly representatives. All of this is enough to prove how sincerely we have implemented the ceasefire order and the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference. Chiang Kai-shek, on the other hand, has done the opposite. With the promulgation of the ceasefire order came military offensives, launching a full-scale civil war, and now he has occupied more than 180 county towns in our liberated areas. In short, we have resolutely supported and implemented the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference and the ceasefire order, while the Chiang Kai-shek reactionaries have done everything possible to undermine them." Vice Chairman Rong then pointed out the various facts of American imperialism's collusion and interference in China's internal affairs under the guise of the Prisoner of War Mediation Office, expressing great anger at the atrocities of the American military raping a female student at Peking University and violating our national dignity. He said, "No wonder many people have protested to Truman, saying that the American military is worse than the Japanese military. We Chinese people hate American aggressors even more than we hate flies, snakes, scorpions, and centipedes." He powerfully concluded his speech by saying: "We must use the victorious patriotic self-defense war to oppose all of Chiang Kai-shek's traitorous treaties and support the burgeoning patriotic democratic movement in the KMT-controlled areas."
　　General Kong Zongzhou, commander of the 38th Army of the Northwest Democratic Allied Army, mentioned with extreme hatred the various atrocities committed by the American military in China, especially the blatant rape of a female student at Peking University in the ancient cultural capital of Beiping. He said: "Why do the American imperialists dare to treat China as a colony? Why do they run rampant in our territory and not treat us as human beings? It is all because of the heinous national enemy Chiang Kai-shek!" He warned the Chiang-American reactionaries: "Today, the 140 million people in the liberated areas under the direct leadership of the Communist Party of China are the main force in striving for the independence, freedom, and liberation of the motherland. They are fully engaged in the patriotic self-defense war, and the second, third, and fourth victories of Yutai and Lunan, combined with the national democratic patriotic movement, will completely smash the Chiang-American reactionaries' offensive and establish an independent and free New China."
　　Comrade Nie Zhen, Minister of Civil Affairs of the Central Bureau of the CCP Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu, loudly proposed "Everything for the victory of the patriotic self-defense war." We must make another effort to thoroughly realize "land to the tiller" and carry out the great production movement.

　　纪念停战令及政协会议周年
    边区各界万人集会
    戎副主席等讲演指责蒋介石背信违约发动内战，号召全区军民继续努力，粉碎蒋军进攻。
    【本报特讯】边区各界军民万余人，十三日于边府驻地，举行停战令、政协会议周年纪念大会。
    上午十一时半，国旗上升，鸣炮开会后，戎伍胜副主席开始讲话。他说：去年今日，我们为了坚决执行停战令，太岳部队已经打进了曲沃城，竟毅然撤出城外，在冀鲁豫，我们部队已攀登聊城城墙，也决然地撤下来了。为了执行整军方案，我区首批复员军人达七万五千余人。为了执行交通协定，我们抽调大批干部，成立平汉、道清、同蒲南段等铁路局，仅邯郸一地就招募了一千五百多工人修路。我们也慎重而认真的完成了国大代表的选举。所有这一切，都足以证明我们是如何诚心诚意地执行了停战令与政协决议。蒋介石则相反，他随着停战令的颁布而来的是军事进攻，发动全面内战，现在已占去我解放区一百八十余座县城。总之一句话，我们坚决拥护与执行了政协决议与停战令，而蒋介石反动集团，则尽一切破坏之能事。戎副主席接着指出美帝国主义帮凶，借遣俘调处为名，干涉中国内政的种种事实，对这次美军奸污北大女生，奸污我国国格的兽行，表示莫大的愤怒，他说：“难怪很多人向杜鲁门提出抗议说，美军比日军还不如。我们中国人民讨厌美国侵略者，比讨厌苍蝇、讨厌蛇蝎蚰蜒还厉害。”他有力地结束他的讲演说：“我们要以胜利的爱国自卫战争，来反对蒋介石一切卖国条约，支援蒋管区方兴未艾的爱国民主运动。”
    西北民主联军三十八军军长孔纵周将军，极端憎恨地提及美军在华种种暴行，尤其是公然在文化古都北平强奸北大女生的事。他说：为什么美帝国主义者胆敢把中国当成殖民地？在我们国土上横行霸道，把我们不当人看待呢？都是由于万恶的民族敌人蒋介石呀！他警告蒋美反动派说：“今天在中国共产党直接领导下的解放区一万万四千万人民，是争取祖国独立自由解放的主力，他们正在全力地进行爱国自卫战争，再来第二个、第三个、第四个鱼台、鲁南大捷，和全国的民主爱国运动配合起来，会彻底粉碎蒋美反动派进攻，建立起一个独立自由的新中国。”
    中共晋冀鲁豫中央局民运部长聂真同志，响亮地提出“一切为着爱国自卫战争的胜利。”要再努一把力，彻底实现“耕者有其田”，开展大生产运动。
