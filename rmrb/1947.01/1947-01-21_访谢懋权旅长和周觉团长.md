　　Visiting Brigade Commander Xie Maoquan and Regiment Commander Zhou Jue

　　Xie Maoquan, the brigade commander of the 140th Brigade of the 17th Division of the Kuomintang army, and Zhou Jue, the regiment commander of the 280th Regiment, who came all the way from Taiwan to Yutai and laid down their weapons, have arrived at the headquarters of the Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Military Region a few days ago. In a quiet and warm room, the reporter met them. Brigade Commander Xie and Regiment Commander Zhou were both bald, sitting around the brazier, reading the People's Daily published here. The wide-brimmed American military hats they brought were far away, hiding on the wall behind the door. They said: "Although we suddenly came to the cold and frozen northern country from the warm south, the warm reception of the Eighth Route Army as equals and the distribution of brand-new cotton trousers and cotton shoes made us feel deeply warmed."

　　During the conversation, I watched the receptionist diligently washing their lice-infested shirts, and couldn't help but think of the disaster suffered by this unit stationed far away in Taiwan, forced by Chiang Kai-shek's urgent orders for internal warfare: they marched day and night from Taiwan to Yutai. The officers and soldiers had been exhausted for half a month, but Chiang Kai-shek's military order was to quickly reinforce Jinxiang and attack the People's Liberation Army led by Commander Liu Bocheng, the ever-victorious general. As a result, the battle lasted only eight hours, and all the officers and soldiers of the 140th Brigade suffered unnecessary sacrifices and were completely annihilated.

　　Thinking of this, Brigade Commander Xie was very indignant. He said: "On December 19th, we were ordered to return to the mainland from Taiwan. We originally thought it was to exchange defenses with the domestic troops, but we didn't expect that after the troops arrived in Xuzhou overnight, the superiors ordered us to leave our families behind and continue north under the command of Fang Xianjue. At this time, everyone realized that they were participating in the civil war, and the morale of all the officers and soldiers suddenly cooled down." "And the most painful thing," Brigade Commander Xie said, "was when we assembled in Shitun (near Xuzhou), it was already the second day after leaving Xuzhou. No one was taking care of our families yet, and they were still sleeping on the ice under the platform. Who doesn't have a wife and children, who would be willing to abandon their wives and children after the victory of the Anti-Japanese War to slaughter their own compatriots? Many officers cried secretly when they heard about this situation. Many officers in the barracks were thinking about their children, who were either begging or being forced into prostitution. Chiang Kai-shek's traitorous civil war has harmed us so miserably! ... When the troops arrived in Yutai, the hearts of the officers and soldiers had already flown back. How can we fight such a battle? No matter how superior the American weapons are, it is inevitable that the entire army will be wiped out!"

　　Regiment Commander Zhou Jue, like all straightforward soldiers, frankly expressed the feelings of the Kuomintang officers and soldiers who were unwilling to participate in the civil war. He said: "Eight years of the Anti-Japanese War resulted in a civil war. After fighting back and forth, we ended up with a godfather (American imperialism). This is really a disgrace to our soldiers and a disaster for the country and the nation!" He cited a period of history of the deeply troubled Chinese nation to illustrate the current disaster of the motherland. He said: "In the past, Wu Sangui wanted to become emperor, so he did not hesitate to betray the country and collude with the Qing army to enter the customs, causing the Manchus to enslave China for more than two hundred years. Later, the corrupt Qing emperors, under the traitorous policy of 'rather give to friendly countries than to domestic slaves,' signed many unequal treaties, which ruined the country. What is the difference between today's Chiang government and the past? Therefore, when all the officers and soldiers of the regiment received the order to go to the front line of the civil war, they were extremely angry. Everyone felt that such a war was too nameless (the glory of bloody resistance to Japan disappeared), too unreasonable (unjustified), and too unprofitable (wives and children were separated). Many people even lost heart and wanted to leave the army immediately to become monks. Why couldn't you eliminate more than 50 brigades of such an army in half a year?" When talking about the situation of the regiment laying down its weapons in the suburbs of Yutai this time, Regiment Commander Zhou's expression became even more sad and painful. He said: "On January 6th, when the 140th Brigade arrived in Yutai, Fang Xianjue (Chiang's confidante) placed us on the front line, while they were stationed in the city. We couldn't figure out the situation at all, and we were surrounded by the Eighth Route Army at night. The battle continued from 12:00 to dawn the next day, and none of Fang Xianjue's troops came to reinforce us. Many veteran cadres who fought with me in the Anti-Japanese War sacrificed meaninglessly. What made me especially heartbroken was that more than 1,000 overseas Chinese in the entire brigade. Chiang Kai-shek, who lacked soldiers, forced them, who had been enslaved by Japanese imperialism for more than 50 years and had just gained peace, onto the battlefield of the civil war, making them meaningless victims." Zhou Jue, filled with grief and indignation, was unwilling to continue sacrificing in vain. At that time, he resolutely convened a cadre meeting and decided that the entire regiment would lay down its weapons and send representatives to contact the Eighth Route Army. In this way, more than 1,000 officers and soldiers of the 280th Regiment ended the mission given to them by Chiang Kai-shek.

　　After coming to the Liberated Area, they saw that the people here were wholeheartedly working with the Eighth Route Army to defend the Liberated Area and protect the people's fruits of liberation, which made them deeply understand the justice of the Liberated Area's military and civilians' self-defense operations. Brigade Commander Xie said: "Although the Yutai operation was short and we didn't understand much, we deeply admired the Eighth Route Army for its unusually well-informed combat intelligence because it was supported by the people. The commanders were also able to quickly concentrate their main forces to carry out the battle. On the contrary, I was a blind man with his eyes open after arriving in the Liberated Area. What's the point of fighting such a war?!" He went on to say: "What I find most refreshing in the Liberated Area is that everyone here has unlimited enthusiasm for their work, and has firm confidence in the ongoing self-defense war." And what about the non-Liberated Area? At this time, Regiment Commander Zhou added: "It's the exact opposite. Their unanimous belief is 'the Chiang army will be defeated'."

　　访谢懋权旅长和周觉团长
    从台湾远道赶至鱼台放下武器的蒋军十七师一四○旅旅长谢懋权，二八○团团长周觉，已于日前抵达晋冀鲁豫军区总部。在一间幽静而暖和的屋子里，记者会见了他们。谢旅长和周团长都光着头，围在火盆旁边，阅读此间出版的人民日报。他们戴来的宽边美式军帽，已远远的躲在门后的墙壁上了。他们说：“此次虽骤从暖和的南方来到天寒地冻的北国，但八路军一视同仁的亲切招待，和崭新的棉裤和棉鞋的发给，又使自己深深的感到温暖。”
    谈话中，我看着招待员殷勤的替他们换洗长满了虱子的衬衫，不由得想到这支远驻台湾的部队，在蒋介石火急的内战军令迫使下，所遭受的灾难：他们由台湾开到鱼台，昼夜行军，半个月来官兵早已疲惫不堪，但蒋介石的军令，却是火速增援金乡，进攻常胜将军刘伯承司令所统率的人民解放军，结果战斗只进行了八小时，一四○旅全体官兵就遭致了无谓牺牲和全军覆灭。
    想到这些，谢旅长是很愤激的。他说：“十二月十九日，我们由台湾奉命回国，原想是和国内的部队换防，那晓得部队星夜开抵徐州后，上级即命令我们把家属撇下，部队继续北上，归方先觉指挥。这时大家才明白是参加打内战，全体官兵的心情顿时冷了。”“而最痛心的”，谢旅长说：“当我们在石屯（徐州附近）集结时，已经是离开徐州的第二天了。我们的眷属还没有人照顾，还睡在月台下的冰地上。谁无妻室儿女，谁愿意抗战胜利后，再抛妻离子来残杀自己的同胞呢？许多军官听到这种情形，都暗暗的哭了，许多军官在军营中，都在惦念自己儿女或者正流为乞丐，或者正被逼为娼妓。蒋介石的卖国内战，害得我们多么的惨呀！………部队开到鱼台，官兵们的心，早就飞回去了。这样的仗怎么还能打呢？再有优势的美国武器，也难免全军覆没呵！”
    周觉团长，像一切爽直的军人一样，他坦白的倾吐了不愿内战的蒋军官兵的心怀。他说：“抗战八年，抗出了个内战，打来打去，拚出了个干爸爸（美帝国主义），这真是我们军人的耻辱，国家民族的灾难！”他引证了灾困深重的中华民族的一段历史，来说明目前祖国的灾难。他说：“过去吴三桂想当皇帝，便不惜卖国求荣勾引清兵入关，使满清奴役了中国二百多年。以后腐朽的满清皇帝，又在宁赠友邦，勿予家奴的卖国政策下，订立了许多不平等条约，弄得国家一败涂地。今天的蒋政府，和过去有什么分别呢？因此全团官兵得到开赴内战前线的命令时，都气愤极了，大家都感到这样的战争太无名（流血抗战的光荣消失了），太无理（师出无名），太无利了（妻离子散）。很多人甚至灰心得想立刻离开部队，去当和尚，这样的部队，为什么你们在半年中，不能消灭他五十多个旅呢？”谈及此次鱼台城郊该团放下武器的情形时，周团长的表情更加伤感而沉痛。他说：“一月六日，当一四○旅开达鱼台后，方先觉（嫡系）即把我们摆在第一线，他们却驻在城里，我们一点情况也摸不清，晚上即被八路军包围了。战斗由十二时继续到次日拂晓，方先觉的部队一个也没有来增援，许多随我一道抗战的老干部，都无谓的牺牲了。特别使我痛心的是全旅中一千多位侨胞，兵源缺乏的蒋介石，竟把遭受了日本帝国主义五十多年的奴役，刚刚获得和平的他们逼到内战战场上，作了无谓的牺牲品。”悲愤交集的周团长，再不愿意白白牺牲下去，当时便毅然召集干部会议，决定全团放下武器，并派代表与八路军联络，二八○团一千多位官兵，就这样结束了蒋介石给予他们的任务。
    来解放区后，他们看到这里的人民，正一心一意的和八路军一道，保卫解放区，保护人民的翻身果实，使他们深深的认识了解放区军民自卫作战的正义性。谢旅长说：“此次鱼台作战，时间虽然短促了解不多，但我们深佩八路军因为得到人民的支持而使作战情报异常灵通，指挥员又能迅速集中主力，进行战斗，而我则恰恰相反，到了解放区后，则是一个睁着眼睛的瞎子，你想这样的战争，还有个什么打头呢？！”他接着又说：“在解放区最使我感到新鲜的，是这里的每一个人员，都对自己工作具有无限的热心，而对于正在进行的自卫战争，都具有坚定的必胜信心。”而非解放区呢？这时周团长补充说：“那就是恰恰相反，他们一致的信心则是‘蒋军必败’”。
