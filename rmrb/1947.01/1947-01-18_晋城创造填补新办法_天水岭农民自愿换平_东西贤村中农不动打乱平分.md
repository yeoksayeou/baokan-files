Taiyue, 16th of this paper – In the process of realizing "land to the tiller," the masses of Jincheng have created new methods for leveling the field and making up for deficiencies in land distribution. In some villages, feudal forces have been eliminated, but some peasants have not yet completely turned over. Therefore, Guo Gelian, a hero of Tianshuiling who turned over, created a method of "exchanging to equalize." Taking the agricultural association小组(small group) as the unit, people mutually exchanged good and bad land. Those who obtained more good land would offer it to those who had not completely turned over, and exchange it for bad land. The masses called it a method of leveling the field that "does not hurt feelings and does not break harmony." Shen Dabai, an elementary school teacher, obtained several acres of good land during the mass movement, totaling fourteen acres of good land for a family of five. Therefore, he voluntarily gave up five acres of good land and six rooms to poor peasants who had not completely turned over, and exchanged them for some bad land, which was praised by everyone. Dongxi Xian Village created a method of "not moving the middle peasants and randomly dividing the land." Each family received a cow, a large house, and a small house. The land was evaluated by people. A household of two people received nine acres of land, averaging four and a half acres per person; a household of four people received sixteen acres of land, averaging four acres per person; and a household of seven people received twenty-one acres of land, averaging three acres per person, and the land was interspersed with good and bad. Good and bad land were divided equally in the whole village. For every acre of good or nearby land received, it must be matched with an acre of bad or distant land. More than 98% of the peasants in the village were satisfied with this method. Villages that distributed land using the above two methods have achieved "land to the tiller" better, and Tianshuiling is one example.

　　晋城创造填补新办法
    天水岭农民自愿换平
    东西贤村中农不动打乱平分
    【本报太岳十六日电】晋城群众在实现耕者有其田中，创造了填平补齐分配土地的新办法。某些村子封建势力已被消灭，但仍有部分农民未翻身，所以天水岭翻身英雄郭葛联，创造一种“换平”的办法，以农会小组为单位，互相调换好坏地，分得好地多的人，拿出好地和未翻透身的人换坏地，群众叫作“不伤面子，不失和气”的填补办法。小学教员申大白，群众运动中又分得几亩好地，共有十四亩好地，五口人，因此他便自愿让出五亩好地，六间房给未翻透身的贫苦农民，换回一些坏地来，得到大家赞扬。东西贤村创造一村“中农不动打乱平分”的办法，每家分得一头牛，一座大房，一座小房，土地以人评议，一户两口人者分九亩地，每人平均四亩半；一户四口人者，分十六亩地，每人平四亩；一户七口人者分二十一亩地，平均每人三亩，并且好坏参插。全村好坏地均各一半，每分得一亩好地或近地，必须搭配一亩坏地或远地，这种办法，全村百分之九十八以上农民皆满意，经以上两种办法分配土地的村庄，耕者有其田实现的较好，天水岭即是一例。
