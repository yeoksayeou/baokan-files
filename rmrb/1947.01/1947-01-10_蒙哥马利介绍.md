After the war, he served as a lieutenant colonel staff officer, and later as a staff officer in the Rhineland, Ireland, India, and other places. Later, he graduated from the British Staff College.
    After the outbreak of World War II, he commanded the British Third Division to fight in France, and in 1940, he retreated back to Britain in the Battle of Dunkirk. He then commanded the British Eighth Army in the North African desert, where he achieved considerable success. In the summer of 1944, Montgomery was appointed Commander-in-Chief of the British forces on the Second Front. He greatly praised the cooperation between Britain and the Soviet Union during the war. He is now visiting the Soviet Union as the Chief of the General Staff of the British Army.
