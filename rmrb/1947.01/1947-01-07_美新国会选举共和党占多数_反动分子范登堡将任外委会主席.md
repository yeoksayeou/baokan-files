Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 5th: Washington dispatch: The new U.S. Congress was revealed on the 3rd. In the House, Republican Massachusetts Congressman Martin was elected Speaker. The Congress was elected in the general election last November, with Republicans holding 246 seats in the House, Democrats 188 seats, and the Labor Party 1 seat. In the Senate, Republicans hold 51 seats and Democrats 45 seats. It is predicted that the Republicans in the new Congress will propose a number of reactionary bills, such as in foreign policy: canceling mutual trade agreements and demanding that other countries make unilateral "open door" policies, restricting foreign loans and international relief. In domestic affairs: restricting labor rights, reducing corporate tax rates, etc. If these bills are passed, it will undoubtedly accelerate the arrival of the American economic crisis and increase various difficulties at home and abroad. Republican reactionaries such as Vandenberg plan to serve as Chairman of the Senate Foreign Affairs Committee, Taft plans to serve as Chairman of the Labor Department, and White plans to take charge of the Commerce Committee. Truman will attend Congress on the 6th to read a message.

    美新国会选举共和党占多数
    反动分子范登堡将任外委会主席
    【新华社延安五日电】华盛顿讯：美国新国会于三日揭露众院方面已选出共和党麻萨诸塞州议员马丁为议长，此对国会为去年十一月大选所选出者，众院共和党占二四六席、民主党一八八席、劳工党一席，参院中共和党占五十一席、民主党四十五席，各方预测新国会中共和党将提出若干反动法案，如在对外政策方面：取消互相贸易协定，而要求别国作单方的“门户开放”限制对外贷款及国际救济。在内政方面：限制劳工权利，减低公司税率等，倘此等法案一经通过，无异将加速美国经济危机之到来及加重国内外各种困难。共和党反动分子如范登堡拟出任参院外交委员会主席，塔虎托则拟任劳工部主席，而怀特则拟掌商业委员会，杜鲁门将于六日出席国会宣读咨文。
