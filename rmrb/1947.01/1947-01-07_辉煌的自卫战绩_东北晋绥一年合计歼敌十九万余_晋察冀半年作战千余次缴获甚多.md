Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, December 30th: (Delayed) The headquarters of the Northeast Democratic Allied Army recently released a summary of the achievements in the self-defense war and bandit suppression over the past year, revealing that the Northeast Truce Agreement of March 27th, the 15-day "Ceasefire Order" of June 7th, and the reaffirmed "Ceasefire Order" of September 23rd were entirely deceptive tools and means used by Chiang and the US to cover up their offensives. Chiang Kai-shek not only relied on the United States to transport over 200,000 fully American-equipped troops from within the customs to attack us from the front, but also incorporated all remaining enemy and puppet forces and bandits in the Northeast to wreak havoc in our rear areas in coordination with his frontal offensive. Our Northeast military and civilians bravely fought back in self-defense, and the achievements in the self-defense war and bandit suppression battles over the past year (from January to the end of November) are as follows: (1) Over 1,800 battles of various sizes. (2) Over 146,000 Chiang's puppet troops and bandits were killed, wounded, or captured (including over 30,000 killed, over 49,000 wounded, and 66,000 captured). In addition, over 12,000 surrendered to us. Among the Chiang's military officers below the regimental commander level who were killed or captured, the following were killed: the commander of the 75th Regiment of the 25th Division of the 52nd Army; the following were wounded: Zhao Lin, commander of the 91st Division of the 71st Army; the following were captured: Li Zhengyi, commander of the 25th Division of the 52nd Army, deputy commanders Duan Peide and Huang Jianyong, Li Gongyan, commander of the 71st Regiment, Jia Nailong, deputy commander of the 74th Regiment, Zhao Zhenggo, commander of the 75th Regiment, Luo Biaoxiong, deputy commander of the 266th Regiment of the 89th Division of the 13th Army, and Wei Yaodong, commander of the 263rd Regiment of the 88th Division of the 71st Army. In the bandit suppression battles, the following were captured: Li Nitang, a bandit chieftain appointed by Chiang Kai-shek as "Commander of the First Army Group Branch of the Northeast Advance Army with the rank of General," Xie Niwendong, "Commander-in-Chief of the Fifth Army Group with the rank of Lieutenant General," Zhang Heizi, "Commander-in-Chief of the Advance Army with the rank of Lieutenant General," Wang Naikang, "Deputy Commander of the First Army and Commander-in-Chief of Nen-Dong of the Pioneer Army," and the following Chiang's puppet bandit leaders who were lurking in the rear and plotting riots were captured: Cao Xiqi, "Commander-in-Chief of the Fifth War Zone of the Central Pioneer Army," Jiang Pengfei, "Commander of the Newly Organized 27th Army," Deng Bokang, "Commander of the First Army of the Sixth Allied Army of the Northeast National Salvation Army," Yang Dequan, "Commander of the Second Army," Cui Dagang, "Commander of the Third Army," Jing Yinyi, "Deputy Commander," and over 20 other division and brigade commanders.

In addition, with the addition of General Pan Shuoduan and General Zheng Zuzhi, the commander and deputy commander of the 184th Division of the 60th Army, who revolted with over x thousand people, the total is 161,459 people, including 89,214 Chiang's troops and 72,245 Chiang's bandits.
