　　Linqing's commerce is thriving one year after liberation. When our army liberated Linqing last September, there were only 527 shops. This September, the number of businesses has reached 3,650. Linqing's pickles are famous in North China. At the beginning of the liberation, there were only 20 pickle shops. This September, the number increased to 34, and another 12 have been added since September. According to Mr. Wang Xizhai, chairman of the Pickle Industry Association, "The profit of the pickle industry this year has been unprecedented. After liberation, all industries prospered. Industries such as bamboo, wood, iron, saltpeter, leather, flour, meat, hotels and warehouses, cigarettes... oil pressing, grain, and shoe factories have sprung up. At the beginning of the liberation, there were only 19 bamboo and wood businesses, and now there are more than 100. The iron and saltpeter industries were almost completely destroyed by the Japanese invaders. Now there are 6 larger iron industries and 25 handicraft industries."
　　[Another dispatch] Under the support of our democratic government, private industrial and commercial enterprises in Linqing City have made huge profits in the past year. Yihua Iron Factory started with only 1.66 million yuan of capital, and now it has reached 80 million yuan. Zhicheng Cigarette Factory started with 170,000 yuan, and Dasheng with 110,000 yuan, and now both have reached more than 10 million yuan. Li Yutang, who came to escape the famine, was rescued by the democratic government, and this year opened a pot lid shop in Kuotong Lane. Now he bought a house with 200,000 yuan and has more than 300,000 yuan of working capital. The general commercial profit of the city has been at least five times higher in the past year. In order to greatly develop the city's commerce, in the mass movement, full consideration is given to public and private businesses, and the houses and places taken back from traitors and local bullies that are convenient for the development of industry and commerce are sold to industrialists and businessmen at low prices. Industrialists and businessmen have rushed to buy houses. Tongxingde Drugstore bought a yard for 3.1 million yuan, and Guanghe Drugstore bought a yard for 1 million yuan.

　　临清解放一年市面繁荣
    私营工商业大赚钱
    【本报威县十日电】解放一年的临清商业欣欣向荣。我军去年九月解放临清时，仅有商店五百二十七家，今年九月商家已达三千六百五十家。临清酱菜驰名华北，初解放时酱园仅有二十家，今年九月增至三十四家，九月后新增加的又有十二家。据酱菜业公会的主席汪淅斋先生谈：“这一年多酱菜业营利是空前的。解放后各业繁荣，竹、木、铁、硝、皮及面业、肉业、旅店货栈、卷烟………榨油、粮食、鞋工厂等业纷纷兴起，初解放时竹木业共十九家，现在增至一百余家。铁业、硝皮业，被日寇摧残殆尽，现在已有较大的铁工业六家，手工业二十五家”。
    【又讯】临清市各私营工商业在我民主政府扶助下一年来盈利巨大。益华铁工厂开办时仅一百六十六万元的资金，现已达八千万元，志成烟厂开办时十七万元，大生十一万元，现均达千万元以上。逃荒来的李玉堂，经民主政府救济，今年在箍桶巷开了一座锅盖铺，现在以二十万元买了处宅子，尚有三十多万元的流动资本。该市一般商业利润一年来至少在五倍以上。为了大量发展城市之商业，在群众运动中充分照顾公私营商家，并将收回汉奸恶霸地主的房屋及便利发展工商业的地方，低价卖予工商业家。各工商业家纷纷争购房屋，同兴德药庄以三百一十万元买了一处院子，广和药庄以百万元买了一处。
