　　Excessive Taxes and Levies Make Life Difficult for Both Rich and Poor
    Jiang’s Army in Guantai Forces Landlord to Death
  　Wu Tongfu Recognizes the Enemy and Friend and Flees to Our Area
    [Report from this newspaper in Anyang] Landlord Sun Shouzheng of Guantai was forced to death due to his reliance on Jiang’s army, while Wu Tongfu fled to our area to celebrate a new life. This fact sharply contrasts the two paths for landlords in the Jiang-occupied areas. Note: The well-known landlord Sun Shouzheng was reasonably liquidated after we liberated Guantai. The masses were magnanimous and provided care in many ways, leaving him enough land to live on. However, Sun remained unaware and, when Jiang’s army invaded, he embraced illusions and welcomed Jiang’s army, considering them "family." Unexpectedly, the Jiang family was not lenient towards him. On December 12th, a note for 200,000 (currency unit not specified) from Jiang’s army demanding payment still arrived at his home, and the person urging payment was assertive, demanding "immediate payment." Sun Shouzheng was so cornered that he had no way to go to heaven or earth, rolled around on the ground in a frenzy, and then died of suffocation. However, Wu Tongfu, one of the so-called four major landlords in Guantai, after experiencing life under Jiang’s army's occupation of Guantai, saw through the obvious fact that "when the disastrous army comes, both the rich and the poor suffer." In complete contrast to Sun Shouzheng, he resolutely fled to the liberated area. When Wu and his family arrived in the liberated area on December 20th, he said indignantly: "Look at what that gang (Jiang’s army) is like; if they are not upright, how can they succeed!" Wu and his family immediately received help and relief from our democratic government and have now settled in the liberated area, spending their first happy and pleasant New Year.

　　横征暴敛穷富难活
    观台蒋军逼死地主
  　吴同福认清敌友逃来我区
    【本报安阳讯】观台地主孙守正仰仗蒋军被逼死，吴同福逃来我区庆新生。这事实，尖锐的对比了蒋占区地主的两条道路。按：著名地主孙守正当我解放观台后，曾被合理清算，群众宽大为怀，多方照顾，留给足够生活的土地。但孙仍不自觉，反在蒋军侵来时，抱着幻想迎接蒋军，认为是“一家人”，孰料蒋家对他并不宽大。十二月十二日，蒋军催款廿万的条子照样飞到他家，且催款人态度强硬，“立马就要起款”。孙守正当时被逼得上天无路入地无门，爬在地下乱滚一阵，旋告气绝。但号称观台四大地主之一的吴同福，在他过了蒋军侵陷观台的一段生活后，看穿了“遭殃军”来了穷富都遭殃这一明显事实后，他和孙守正完全相反，毅然逃来解放区。十二月二十日吴氏携带全家到达解放区时，愤慨的说：“你看那伙（蒋军）像个啥样，行的不正，还能成事！”吴氏全家当即受到我民主政府的帮助和救济，现已在解放区安家，度过了第一个幸福愉快的新年。（北斗、廷芳、砚田）
