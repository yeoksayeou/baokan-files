    Scene Two: Such "Peace"
    (Center stage features a screen changed to display a large "Peace" character, with the central door still closed but able to be opened. Left and right of the screen are signs, left: "National Government," right: "Chiang, Soong, Kung, Chen." Two Nationalist soldiers patrol the square in a crisscross pattern. A news reporter enters from the left. The Nationalist soldiers raise their guns to aim.)
    Soldier: Stop! What are you doing?
    Reporter: I'm a news reporter.
    Soldier: What's the matter?
    Reporter: Why are you so fierce? (Points to the "Peace" door) Aren't you talking about peace?
    Soldier: That's right, talking about peace, didn't hit you, what are you doing here?
    Reporter: I'm here to take pictures.
    Soldier: (Changes attitude, intimately) Oh! Taking pictures, good, come quickly, come quickly, they're waiting! (To inside) Report, the photographer is here, taking pictures!
    Chiang: (Pokes his head out from behind the peace door, Soong, Kung, and Chen also poke their heads out) Good, photographer, take a peace photo of us! (The two soldiers frantically ask the news reporter)
    Soldier: How should we pose?
    Chiang: Get out of the way, don't block my "Peace" characters. (The soldiers hurriedly put down their guns and each hold up the signs on the left and right for the photo.)
    Soldier: Let's take the photo like this!
    Chen: Photographer, be sure to get the "Peace" characters in the picture.
    Reporter: (Taking the picture) Please straighten your head, Chairman.
    Chiang: Nonsense, I am Chiang Kai-shek, I have always been centered and upright, how can you talk nonsense.
    Reporter: Please smile, Chairman.
    Chiang: That's not bad, now we're talking about peace, we have to put on a smiling face, let me try to put one on.
    Reporter: Don't be so murderous.
    Chen: Nonsense, how can you photograph murderous intent onto a picture, stop being verbose, we have things to do.
    Chiang: After you take it, publish it on the front page of the "Peace" Daily.
    Reporter: Yes.
    (After the photo is taken, the four retract their heads. Marshall enters from the upper right, still wearing his peace coat, holding a peace dove.)
    Marshall: What are you doing?
    Reporter: Taking pictures.
    Marshall: Is it done?
    Reporter: Yes, (puts down the camera and turns to Marshall) Would you like to take one too?
    Marshall: Good, I want to take a profile, we Americans have always been high and mighty, I have to stand up to take it. (Stands on the stool on the right of the stage, the reporter takes the photo from the left.)
    Reporter: That won't do, Marshal Marshall.
    Marshall: Why?
    Reporter: Your peace coat is too short, your true colors are showing, you're wearing the Chief of Staff's military boots!
    Marshall: Oh! Right, I'll take it down here! (Marshall comes down from the stool.)
    Reporter: Still won't do, you have to squat lower, the military pants are still showing!
    Marshall: Oh! (Gradually squats down.)
    Reporter: Lower, lower, lower, even lower: (Marshall has squatted to the lowest point, like a sitting dog)
    Marshall: (Angrily, jumps up) Stop! You idiot, wouldn't I lose my great American status?
    Reporter: (Simultaneously) Don't move, perfect (takes the picture).
    Marshall: (Angrily) Idiot, are all Chinese people dead pigs, don't you know how to take a half-body shot? Don't publish my photo tomorrow, (to the soldiers) Get him out.
    Soldier: (To the reporter) Get out, if the photo isn't good tomorrow, you'll lose your head!
    Reporter: What, aren't you talking about peace? Why do you threaten to take heads at every turn.
    Soldier: Idiot! (The soldier hits the reporter, the reporter exits, the two soldiers also follow him offstage.)
    Marshall: Hey, Chiang, what are you doing?
    (A burst of train whistle, car horn, and shouting drill sounds.)
    Chiang: (Responding from inside) I'm busy deploying troops and generals.
    Marshall: Are you confident in fighting the Communists now?
    Chiang: (Pokes his head out) This, this... this, this.... My subordinates still have a bit of "Communist phobia."
    Marshall: Then don't be busy, let me help you conduct "peace negotiations."
    Chiang: Right, you help me negotiate!
    Marshall: (To Chiang) Give me the final decision-making power.
    Chiang: (Takes out a piece of paper, on which is written "Final Decision-Making Power") This is China's "Final Decision-Making Power," I give it to you. From now on, all matters in China, big and small, will be decided by you, you're in charge, you can do whatever you want! (Marshall walks to Chiang, the two whisper to each other, Marshall makes a hitting and pulling gesture, Chiang repeatedly says "yes.")
    Marshall: (To the audience) Chinese people, do you want peace?
    Audience shouts: We do! (One person leads, the crowd shouts in unison.)
    Marshall: Good, it's good that you want peace. Let me ask your Chairman Chiang, (to Chiang) Hey! Chiang, do you want peace?
    Chiang: As long as the Chinese people don't rebel, why wouldn't I want peace?
    Marshall: Good, you two want peace, plus I am the most peace-loving, then what can't we talk about? It will definitely be easy to talk about. (To the audience) Let me ask your Chairman Chiang, what conditions does he have?
    Marshall: Hey! Chiang, what conditions do you have?
    Chiang: My conditions are not harsh, as long as their troops withdraw from northern Jiangsu, withdraw from Zhangjiakou and Chengde!
    Marshall: Right, right, must withdraw, (to the audience) I say, Chinese people, your troops must withdraw from northern Jiangsu, withdraw from Zhangjiakou and Chengde.
    Audience shouts: Why should we withdraw?
    Marshall: (Deliberately deflecting) Oh... this, I have to ask your Chairman Chiang.
    Marshall: (To Chiang) I say, Chiang, why should they withdraw?
    Chiang: Because the troops in northern Jiangsu threaten our capital Nanjing, and the troops in Chengde and Zhangjiakou threaten our Beiping.
    Marshall: Right, right, truly threaten, (to the audience) I say, Chinese people, your northern Jiangsu threatens Nanjing, and Zhangjiakou and Chengde threaten Beiping, so you must withdraw.
    Audience shouts: Doesn't Nanjing also threaten northern Jiangsu? Doesn't Beiping also threaten Zhangjiakou and Chengde?
    Marshall: (Deliberately deflecting) This, this, I can't bring it up to Chairman Chiang.
    Audience: (Loud booing, shouting) Chiang Kai-shek's conditions violate the Political Consultative Conference resolution, you signed it, why are you proposing it for him?
    Marshall: (Crosses his arms) Good, then I will remain silent. (Turns to the Nationalist soldiers and winks, making a hitting gesture.)
    Chiang: Idiot, you common people are all idiots! If you don't listen, I will kill you all. (Turns his head and shouts) Chen Cheng! (Response from inside: "Yes!") Send troops to attack the Liberated Areas! (Response from inside: "Yes!") Chen Lifu! (Response from inside: "Yes!") Quickly send secret agents to suppress the common people! (Response from inside: "Reporting, Chairman, I have already sent people to kill Li Gongpu and Wen Yiduo!") Chiang pulls out a handgun and threatens the audience.
    Audience shouts: Oppose the civil war, defeat Chiang Kai-shek's offensive!
    Marshall: (Pretending to be a good person to the crowd) I think we should still talk! (To Chiang) How about it?
    (Chiang takes out a paper with "Eight Demands")
    Chiang: These are my eight demands, they must agree to them.
    Marshall: Right, right, (to the audience) Chinese people, these are your Chairman Chiang's eight demands.
    Audience shouts: Oppose the eight demands! Mediation must be fair!
    Marshall: (Angrily) What? You don't want to talk anymore? Don't blame me if we can't reach an agreement, come!
    (An American soldier enters, Marshall whispers confidential orders in his ear, the soldier exits. Marshall takes out a large bill, on which is written "Four Hundred Million U.S. Dollars," and pats Chiang on the shoulder.)
    Marshall: Godson, take it and spend it slowly!
    (An American soldier pushes a car onto the stage, Marshall lifts a white cloth with "Surplus Materials" written on it, revealing the large characters "Military Supplies," which contains cannons and other items.)
    Marshall: (Angrily, to the soldier) I told you to send it to him through the back door, (pointing to Chiang), why did you bring it here?
    American Soldier: Yes! (Awkwardly pushes the car to the left exit)
    Chiang: (Excitedly greets) Quickly pull it over, this is for me. (Retracts his head and helps the American soldier pull the car inside.)
    Audience shouts slogans: Oppose American aid to Chiang's civil war, American troops get out of China!
    Marshall: (Angrily) What? You don't want to negotiate? Don't blame me for this, I have to issue a statement! (Takes out a paper: "Marshall Joint Statement") China will have to fight! (Marshall exits from the left, drum sounds become tight and loud, the peace door in the middle is broken open and transformed into its opposite, two large characters "War," Four Nationalist soldiers wearing American-style wide-brimmed hats enter, the first one pushes a cannon, Chen Cheng follows, wearing "Civil War Commander" on his uniform, marches around the stage, holding a gun in a charging pose, Chen Cheng supervises the exit from the left. Chen Lifu, Kung Hsiang-hsi, Soong Tzu-wen, Chiang Kai-shek enter in sequence.)
    Chen: China's illness can't be cured by medicine, now we have to perform surgery.
    Kung: We originally built our family fortune on civil war, if we don't fight a civil war, we will collapse.
    Soong: We rely entirely on the arms business to get rich, if we don't fight a civil war, how can we sell arms.
    Chiang: The Chinese people don't value the country enough, I have no choice but to go to Lushan. (Chiang exits from the left, Marshall enters from the center door.)
    Marshall: I say, Chiang, let's talk a little longer! Talk a little longer, again... what, gone.
    Marshall: (To the audience) Chinese people, Old Chiang has lost his temper, I have no choice, my peaceful dove isn't singing either, I can only ignore it! (Marshall exits from the left)
    Chen, Kung, Soong: Haha... celebrate our victory (Attendants bring wine, the three drink, music starts in the background, clinking of glasses, followed by maniacal laughter.)
    Chen, Kung, Soong: Cheers, haha... cheers to our arms business... haha... (News reporter enters from the left)
    Reporter: Reporting, take another peace photo!
    All three: Idiot, what peace photo are you taking! Get out! (Reporter exits)
    (A woman's voice from behind the stage: "I say Chairman, your Bazi is so good, I see you have two more days of good luck! Haha..."
    Chen: Haha... (To the middle door) I say, Meiling, would you like to come out for a drink! You haven't appeared on stage today, what's wrong, Meiling, have a drink?
    Soong: She is talking business with Flying Tiger General Chennault, the two of them are cooperating to organize a Sino-American Industrial Corporation. She's busy!
    Chen: Good! Making money is important, (bows) I have some goods, I still have to direct him to secretly import, excuse me. Haha... Haha... (Exits from the center door, Soong and Kung follow, background music stops)

    Scene Three: Increasingly Collapsing
    (Center stage features a screen changed to hang a couplet, left: "The Setting Sun is Infinitely 'Good'," right: "Only it's Nearing Dusk". Two attendants enter with a printing press, printing banknotes on stage, one shaking and one pulling, the one pulling looks around left and right, sees no one, and steals legal tender, the one shaking also goes to steal legal tender, but Kung Hsiang-hsi coughs in the background, and hurriedly shakes again, Kung Hsiang-hsi enters from the left.)
    Kung: Faster, faster, (walks to the right exit and calls on the phone) "Hello! Yangtze Trading Company, I am your boss Kung Hsiang-hsi, the exchange rate is about to rise, quickly buy for me, what, Chen Lifu bought it all, damn it, that Chen Lifu is a real idiot, you are all useless, quickly buy more, no spot goods, futures will also do. Hello! Are the newly ordered American goods settled? Not yet, what, Soong Tzu-wen ordered them, idiot, quickly order, buy more, this time the American goods, all smuggled, you hear? Smuggling, as long as there's profit to be made, scoop it up first.
    Kung: (Walks to the printing press) Faster, faster, damn it idiot (kicks away the shaker, the shaker also goes to pull, Kung shakes himself), look, I am faster than you, quickly pull, (at this time the machine can't shake, Kung shakes with all his strength, the puller pulls with all his strength, suddenly with a "boom," the machine breaks, all three fall to the ground. At this moment, Chen Lifu from the left, Soong Tzu-wen from the right, rush on stage, touch Kung, etc., and also fall to the ground, Chen Lifu takes a broken shoe, on which is written "National Assembly," containing National Assembly seat drawing numbers, which also fall on the ground, after a while, everyone gets up, Chen alone bends over to pick up the number slips)
    Kung: (To the attendants) You idiots, how did you shake it?
    Attendant: Is it my fault? Too much legal tender is being issued too quickly, one day it will collapse!
    Kung: Nonsense, quickly get out for me! (Two attendants exit)
    Chen: (Reaches out to Kung) Give it to me!
    Kung: What?
    Chen: Legal tender one hundred sixty million.
    Kung: What for?
    Chen: I bought something.
    Kung: What thing?
    (Chen raises the broken shoe, Kung and Soong both look)
    Soong: Old Chen, where did you pick up a broken shoe?
    Chen: (To Soong) What's wrong with you! Only the Communist Party, the Democratic League and the common people骂us "National Assembly" is a broken shoe, why do you also say it is a broken shoe, I think you are afraid of being communized.
    Soong: Not a broken shoe, what is this?
    Chen: This is clearly the number for drawing seats in the "National Assembly". Chairman Chiang ordered me to convene the "National Assembly". (To Kung) Bring the money!
    Kung: Bullshit, the old National Assembly representatives are all your cronies, stinking and no one wants to smell them, you have to find some decent people, then I will give the money.
    Chen: (To the audience, flicks the banknotes) Who wants to attend my National Assembly? (The audience does not respond, hissing sarcasm.)
    Chen: (Angrily waving the broken shoe) If you don't attend the National Assembly, I will beat you to death!
    Audience shouts: Oppose the one-party National Assembly, oppose dictatorship!
    Chen: (Wants thugs) Good, if you don't come, someone else will come. Hey! Pull them up. (A soldier leads a dog on stage, with a sign hanging around its neck, on which is written "Zeng Qi," and below notes "Youth Party Representative") You want to participate in the "National Assembly"!
    Zeng: (Turns his head and acts unwilling) Woof, woof, woof!
    Chen: What, you dare not go? You licked Wang Jingwei's ass, I will reveal your evidence of being a traitor!
    Zeng: (Kneeling and begging) Woof, woof, woof!
    Chen: Good, then go, (draws a slip and inserts it on Zeng's tail, to the soldier) What about that one!
    Soldier: Zhang Junli? He refuses to appear, he says he is willing to go, but he wants to eat this. (Points to the legal tender)
    Chen: Good! (Grabs a handful of legal tender) Take it and feed it to him, tell him, willing to go must go, unwilling to go must also go! (Soldier leads Zeng offstage)
    Chiang: (Enters) Is everything prepared?
    Chen: Prepared, Chairman, look, this is the number for drawing seats in the National Assembly, this is number one, here is the code, you just draw here, guaranteed number one. That way it looks "democratic"!
    Chiang: This is a small matter, quickly issue an order to all newspapers, during the National Assembly, no war reports are allowed to be published, especially victory news, because we have issued a "ceasefire order".
    Chen: Yes (Chen Cheng enters from the right exit, his left hand wrapped in bandages, hanging around his neck.)
    Chen Cheng: Reporting, Chairman, I am back.
    Chiang: You are back?
    Chen Cheng: Yes, I just returned from the front line.
    Chiang: Coming from the front line, don't let news reporters see you in this state, and don't issue statements, we are about to convene the National Assembly, all war reports, especially news of victory, are not allowed to be published.
    Chen Cheng: Yes, reporting Chairman, we will never publish news of victory.
    Chiang: Do you understand what this is for?
    Chen Cheng: Understand.
    Chiang: Understand what?
    Chen Cheng: This is for...
    Chiang: For what?
    Chen Cheng: This is because we have never won a battle.
    Chiang: Nonsense, this is to deceive the people, we want to convene the "National Assembly".
    Chen Cheng: Really, reporting Chairman, we have never won a battle.
    Chiang: Idiot, where are our American cannons?
    Chen Cheng: Reporting Chairman, our American cannons are all lost, we occupied more than a hundred empty cities.
    Chiang: (Happily) Right, isn't this victory news?
    Chen Cheng: But...
    Chiang: But what?
    Chen Cheng: But we lost forty-five brigades, and sixty thousand puppet troops are still outside.
    Chiang: Idiot, how did those brigade commanders command?
    Chen Cheng: Reporting Chairman, at the brigade commander level, those killed are killed, those captured are captured, there are already more than forty!
    Chiang: Idiot!
    Chen Cheng: Yes.
    Chiang: Idiot!
    Chen Cheng: Yes.
    Chiang: Idiot, idiot, idiot!
    Chen Cheng: Yes, yes, yes. (Soldier enters from the right exit)
    Soldier: Reporting Chairman, please answer the phone.
    Chiang: I'm too angry, Lifu, answer the phone for me! (Chen Lifu answers the phone.)
    Chen: Hello! What, there are 130,000 mutiny troops, so many people are rebelling, Sichuan, Hunan, Hubei... all have them, how so many, ah! Hello, not allowed to be published in the newspaper, you hear, not allowed to be published.
    Chiang: What?
    Chen: (Pretends to be calm) Nothing, nothing!
    Chiang: What exactly is the matter?
    Chen: (Deceitfully) There are thirteen people rebelling, very few, only thirteen.
    Chiang: (Unconcerned) Thirteen, that's not important, they are all communists, kill them all for me! (Soldier enters)
    Soldier: Reporting Chairman, not thirteen, it's one hundred thirty thousand!
    Chiang: (Shocked) Ah, one hundred thirty thousand! So many.
    Chen: (Angrily to the soldier) Idiot, what do you know, get out! (Soldier exits)
    Kung: Reporting Chairman, my machine prints too much too fast, and it broke down; the banknotes are becoming less and less valuable.
    Chiang: (Angrily) You idiots, you don't cherish me enough... my American cannons... my forty-five brigades, my brigade commander... all gone, now, there are 130,000 people rebelling, you're about to ruin the central banknotes! You idiot.
    Kung: (Angrily) Is it my fault?! I quit.
    Chen: You can quit all you want, I want to do it, I say Chairman, it's okay, they are all idiots, I still have two methods, proceeding simultaneously. We will convene the National Assembly on one hand, and attack Yan'an on the other. Heaven will always bless our victory.
    Chiang: Lifu is right, Heaven will always bless our victory, they are too idiotic.
    Chen: Right, Chairman, they are all idiots.
    Kung (Scolds Chen): What ass are you licking!
    Chen: It's none of your business, I don't pee on you.
    Kung: I don't drink water.
    Chen: You damn bureaucratic capital!
    Kung: You damn secret agent politics! (The two go from scolding to fighting, Kung is knocked to the ground by Chen, hissing sounds become loud in the background, Soong and Chen Cheng also make hissing sounds, Chen Cheng points at Chen Lifu: "Deserves it, deserves it.")
    Chiang: (To Soong and Chen Cheng) You quickly maintain order. (Soong steps forward and pulls Chen and Kung apart)
    Chen Cheng: You are too powerful, the National Assembly Presidium, your CC clique occupies more than half, our Fuxing clique has few people, you deserve to die!
    Chen: That's because I'm in charge of party affairs!
    Chen Cheng: You're in charge, you go to the front to fight!
    Chen: Nonsense!
    Chen Cheng: Deserves to die!
    (The two go from scolding to fighting again, Chen Lifu runs up to hit Chen Cheng, and is kicked down by Chen Cheng, Kung also helps with twisting and hitting, Soong tries to pull them apart, making a mess.)
    Chiang: (Extremely angry, shouts loudly) Stop arguing, you don't value me enough, you don't value the country enough, now, the Communist Party still has this much power, my unification has not been completed, what are you still arguing about! If the stage collapses, the people will kill you one by one! Oh, it's killing me. (Faints and falls into the chair, Soong and Kung quickly support him.)
    Soong: Chairman, it's okay, we still have our godfather America as a backing!
    (The telephone rings urgently. Chen Cheng answers.)
    Chen Cheng: Hello, hello, what. American… American prices are falling, too much inventory, this year and next year will definitely not escape the economic panic! … Oh! Oh! (Hangs up the phone and turns to Soong) You say that backing, is just an iceberg!
    Chiang: (Goes up and hears the phone, originally opened his eyes, at this time "Ah" a long sigh, his head hung down again.
    Soldier enters and shouts: ("Report, telegram", hands it to Soong, exits.)
    Soong: Opens and reads, the peddlers in Shanghai and Tianjin are on strike!
    Chen: (Points to Kung) Look, this is all because you want to monopolize the market, forcing them into it!
    Soong: (Again, reading one by one) Liu Bocheng's army captured Liaocheng, Juye, Jiaxiang, Yicheng... during the New Year's offensive, ah, it's terrible, our direct line troops in Shandong, the offensive against Linyi failed, we lost four brigades, more than 27,000 people... (Trembling) Trouble also broke out behind us, the communist army in Su Yu Wan occupied Woyang!... Urgent telegram: Liu Bocheng again annihilated 10,000 of our troops in Yutai, and also captured a brigade commander, oh my god!
    Chen: (To Chen Cheng) What kind of battles are you fighting, ptooey, always a losing general! (Chen Cheng is about to reply, the sounds of slogans rise outside "Punish the Shameless Beast Army!" "American Troops Get Out of China!" "Oppose the Civil War!")
    Soldier: (Rushes on) It's not good, it's not good, several tens of thousands of students marching troops have rushed over! (Exits)
    Chiang: (Struggles to get up) What's going on?
    Soong: It must be the incident of American soldiers raping a female student at Peking University, causing trouble!
    Chiang: (To Chen) What are you doing, didn't I tell you to ban reporting?
    Kung, Chen Cheng: (Together to Chen Lifu) Can't even control the students, what are you doing? All the secret agents you raised are dead pigs!
    (The calls are getting closer, four students, male, female, large, small, enter from the right door, holding flags, Chiang and the others four flee to the left corner, prostrating and trembling.)
    Student: (To the audience) Compatriots, Chiang Kai-shek invited the American army to help him fight the civil war. American devils, are killing people everywhere, raping our male and female compatriots! Now they have raped a female student on the streets of Beiping. Compatriots, we fought a bloody war for eight years, we just drove away the Japanese devils, and the red-haired devils have come to trample on our sisters… (Crying, pauses slightly.) Compatriots, let's shout: Oppose American military atrocities!
    Audience: Oppose American military atrocities!
    Female: American troops get out of China!
    Audience: American troops get out of China!
    University Student: These insults were all brought on by Chiang Kai-shek, he sold everything from heaven to earth, and now he has sold the bodies of Chinese sisters. Do we want to oppose it or not?
    Audience Shouts: Oppose Chiang Kai-shek selling out China!
    Elder Student: Does the "Sino-American Commercial Treaty" he signed count or not?
    Audience Shouts: Cancel the Sino-American Commercial Treaty!
    Elder Student: Why can't there be peace this year? It's because the Chiang, Soong, Kung, Chen four families are making trouble. We want them to restore peace, stop the civil war!
    Audience: Stop the civil war!
    Elder Student: We want to force him to restore the Political Consultative Conference line!
    Audience: Restore the Political Consultative Conference line!
    Elder Student: (To the other students) Let us ask him if he will restore it or not.
    Four Students: (Pressing towards Chiang and the others) Restore it or not?
    (Chiang and the others whisper, each making ugly gestures. At this time, Marshall suddenly pokes his head out from the center door to look, Chiang and the others harden and say: "Won't restore!")
    Audience Shouts: Oppose American military atrocities, American troops immediately withdraw from China! Oppose American aid to Chiang's civil war! (Marshall quickly retracts his head.)
    Elder Student: What to do if they don't restore it?
    Audience Shouts: Fight! Fight! Fight! Oppose Chiang Kai-shek selling out China! Restore the Political Consultative Conference line!
    (The University Students wave the flag, the four of them all take big steps and press towards Chiang and the others! The audience loudly shouts "Fight," Chiang and the others hold their heads and scurry and slip into the curtains.)
                (End of the play)

    边府俱乐部集体创作
    周方执笔
    第二场  如此“和平”
    （出场正中屏风改贴大幅“和平”二字，其中门仍闭住，但可以开，屏风左右各设一牌，左为：“国民政府”，右为：“蒋宋孔陈”，两个蒋军士兵在广场交叉巡逻，一新闻记者从左口上，蒋军举枪瞄准。）
    兵：站住，你是干什么的？
    新：我是新闻记者。
    兵：有什么事？
    新：你们怎么这么凶？（手指“和平”大门）你们不是讲和平吗？
    兵：对，讲和平，又没有揍你，你到底干什么？
    新：我是来照像的。
    兵：（改变态度，亲昵地）呵！照像的，好，快来，快来，他们正等着呢？（对内）报告，照像的来啦，照像啊！
    蒋：（从和平门后伸出头来，宋孔陈亦伸出头）好，照像的，替我们照一个和平像片吧！（两士兵慌忙问新闻记者）
    兵：我们怎么照？
    蒋：滚开，不要挡住了我的“和平”两个字，（兵慌忙放下枪，各执左右所设二牌照像。）
    兵：我们就这样照吧！
    陈：照像的，一定要把“和平”两字个照上去。
    新：（照像）请主席将头摆正。
    蒋：胡说，我叫蒋中正，我向来是中的，是正的，你怎么胡说。
    新：请主席面带笑容。
    蒋：这到不错，现在讲和平，总得装一幅笑脸，让我来装装。
    新：不要这么重的杀气。
    陈：放庇，那有杀气照在像片上去的，你少罗嗦，我们还有事。
    蒋：照好了拿去登在“和平”日报第一版上。
    新：是。
    （照毕，四人缩头，马歇尔从右上，仍穿和平大衣，手拿和平之鸽。）
    马：你们在干什么？
    新：照像。
    马：照好了吗？
    新：好了，（放下照像机转向马）请您也照一张吧！
    马：好，我要照个侧面的，我们美国人向来是高高在上的，我得站起来照。（站在场右的凳上，新在左边照。）
    新：不行，马歇尔元帅。
    马：怎么？
    新：您的和平大衣太短了，露出马脚来了，你穿的是参谋长的军靴呢！
    马：呵！对，我下来照吧！（马从凳上下来。）
    新：还不行，您得蹲低点，军裤还露在外面呢！
    马：呵！（两腿渐渐下蹲。）
    新：再低一点，再低，低，还要低一点，再：（马已蹲低至极处，作坐狗状）
    马：（怒，跳起来）停！混蛋，这不有失我大美国人的身份吗？
    新：（同时）不要动，正好（照）。
    马：（怒）混蛋，中国人都是死猪，你不知道照半身的么？明天不要登我的照片了，（对兵）撵他走。
    兵：（对新）下去，明天照片登不好，要你的脑袋！
    新：怎么，你们不是讲和平吗？怎么动不动就要脑袋。
    兵：混蛋！（兵打新，新下，两士兵亦随下。）
    马：喂，姓蒋的，你在干什么？
    （一阵火车拉笛声，汽车喇叭声，喊操声。）
    蒋：（在内应）我在忙着调兵遣将。
    马：现在打共产党你有把握没有？
    蒋：（把头伸出来）这个，这个……这个，这个……。我的部下都还有点“恐共病”。
    马：那就不用忙，我来帮你进行“和平谈判”吧。
    蒋：对，你帮我谈一谈吧！
    马：（对蒋）给我最后决定权。
    蒋：（拿出一张纸，上写“最后决定权”）这是中国的“最后决定权”，送给您，以后中国的事情，大大小小，都由你最后决定，由你作主，你爱怎么办就怎么办吧！（马走向蒋，二人耳语，马作一打一拉表情，蒋连声称对。）
    马：（向观众）中国的老百姓，你们愿意和平吗？
    观众呼喊：愿意！（由一人领头群众同呼。）
    马：好，愿意和平就好，让我问问你们的蒋主席，（对蒋）喂！姓蒋的你愿意和平么？
    蒋：只要中国老百姓不造反，我又何尝不愿意和平。
    马：好，你们两家都愿意和平，加上我也是最爱和平的，那还有什么谈不成的，一定好谈。（对观众）待我问问你们的蒋主席，看他有什么条件。
    马：喂！我说姓蒋的，你有什么条件？
    蒋：我的条件并不苛刻，只要他们的军队从苏北撤退，从张家口承德撤退！
    马：对对，一定要撤退，（向观众）我说，中国的老百姓，你们的军队，要从苏北撤退，从张家口和承德撤退。
    观众呼喊：为什么要撤退？
    马：（故意推诿）呵……这个，我得问问你们的蒋主席。
    马：（对蒋）我说，姓蒋的，为什么要他们撤退？
    蒋：因为苏北的军队，威胁我们的首都南京，承德和张家口的军队，威胁我们的北平。
    马：对对，真是威胁，（向观众）我说，中国的老百姓，你们的苏北威胁南京，张家口和承德威胁北平，所以要撤退。
    观众呼喊：那南京不是也威胁苏北么？北平不是也威胁张家口和承德么？
    马：（故意推诿）这个，这个，我不便向蒋主席提出。
    观众：（嘘声大起，大呼）蒋介石的条件违背政协决议，你签过字，为什么替他提出？
    马：（一抱膀子）好，那我就保持沈默。（转身向蒋兵做眼色，作打状。）
    蒋：混蛋，你们老百姓都是混蛋！不听话我要大打大杀了。（回头高呼）陈诚！（内应“有！”）发兵进攻解放区！（内应“是！”）陈立夫！（内应“有”）快派特务镇压老百姓！（内应：“报告主席，我已经派人把李公朴、闻一多杀了！”蒋拔出手枪来向观众作威胁状。）
    观众高呼：反对内战，打垮蒋介石的进攻！
    马：（装好人向众）我看还是谈谈吧！（向蒋）怎么样？
    （蒋拿出一纸“八项要求”）
    蒋：这是我的八项要求，要他们承认才行。
    马：对对，（对观众）中国的老百姓，这是你们蒋主席的八项要求。
    观众高呼：反对八项要求！调解要公正！
    马：（怒）怎么？你们不想谈了么？谈不成可不要怪我，来！
    （美兵一人上，马附耳密令，兵下。马取出一张大钞票，上书“四十万万美金”，拍蒋肩）
    马：干儿子，拿着慢慢花吧！
    （美兵推一汽车停场中，马掀开上书“剩余物资”的白布，露出“军火”两个大字，其中装有大炮等。）
    马：（怒，对兵）叫你从后门送给他，（指蒋），为什么开到当场来？
    美兵：也斯！（把车笨拙地推向左口）
    蒋：（兴奋的打招呼）快拉来，这是给我的。（头缩下，帮助美兵把车拉进内。）
    观众呼口号：反对美国助蒋内战，美军退出中国去！
    马：（怒）怎么？你们不愿谈判了吗？这可不能怪我，我得发表声明了（拿出一纸：“马司联合声明”）中国得打起来呵！（马从左口下，鼓声紧响，中间的和平之门被冲开变为他的反面，两个大字“战争”，头带美式宽边帽，蒋军四人上场，其第一人推大炮，陈诚随后，身配：“内战指挥官”，绕场一周，持枪作冲锋状，陈诚督着由左口下。陈立夫、孔祥熙、宋子文、蒋介石依次上）
    陈：中国的病，吃药吃不好了，现在得开刀。
    孔：我们本来是内战起的家，不打内战就要垮。
    宋：我们全凭军火生意发大财，不打内战军火怎么卖。
    蒋：中国的老百姓，太不以国家为重，我也没有办法，只有上庐山。（蒋从左口下，马歇尔从中门上）
    马：我说，姓蒋的，再谈一会吧！再谈一会，再……怎么，走了。
    马：（对观众）中国的老百姓，老蒋可是发了脾气啦，我也没有办法，我的和平的鸽子也不叫啦，我只好不管啦！（马从左口下）
    陈、孔、宋：哈哈……庆祝我们的胜利（侍者端酒上，三人饮酒，场后音乐声起，碰杯之声大作，继以狂笑。）
    陈、孔、宋：干杯，哈哈……为我们的军火生意干杯……哈哈……（新闻记者由左口上）
    新：报告，再照一张和平照片吧！
    三人：混蛋，还照什么和平像！快滚！（新下）
    （场后女人娇声：“我说主席，你的八字就是好，我看还有两天红运呢！哈哈……”
    陈：哈哈……（对中门里）我说，美龄，你出来喝一杯吗！你今天从来没有出场，你怎么啦，美龄，喝一杯吗？
    宋：她在和飞虎将军陈纳德谈生意，他们二人合作，组织了一个中美实业公司。正忙着呢！
    陈：好呵！赚钱要紧，（一拱手）兄弟有点货，还要指挥他秘密进口，少陪了。哈哈……哈哈……（由中门下，宋孔随下后台音乐停）
    第三场  越来越垮
    （出场正中屏风改悬对联一付，左为“夕阳无限‘好’”，右为“只是近黄昏”。二侍者拿印钞机上，在场上印钞票，一摇一拉，拉者左右顾盼，见无人，即偷法币，摇者也去偷法币，但孔祥熙在场后咳嗽，赶忙又摇，孔祥熙从左上。）
    孔：快点，快点，（走到右口打电话）“喂！扬子贸易公司，我是你们的掌柜孔祥熙，外汇快要涨价了，快替我买，怎么，都叫陈立夫买走了，他妈的，陈立夫这小子真混蛋，你们都是饭桶，赶快再买，没有现货，期货也要。喂！新定的美国货定好了吗？还没有，怎么，宋子文订走了，混蛋，快定，多买些，这回美国货，一律走私，听到了没有，走私，只要有油水打捞，先捞了再说。
    孔：（走至印钞机前）快点，快点，他妈的混蛋（踢开摇者，摇者也去拉，孔自己摇），你看，我比你们多快，快拉，（此时机子摇不动了，孔死力摇，拉者死力拉，忽然嘭的一声，机子坏了，三人均倒地。恰于此时，陈立夫由左，宋子文由右，奔上，触着孔等，也都倒地，陈立夫拿一破鞋，上写“国民大会”，内装国民大会坐位抽签号码，也都掉在地上，俄顷，各人均爬起，陈一人弯腰拾号码签）
    孔：（对侍者）你们这些混蛋，你们怎么摇的？
    侍：这怪我？法币出得太多太快，终有一天要崩溃的！
    孔：胡说，快替我滚！（二侍者下）
    陈：（伸手向孔）拿来！
    孔：什么？
    陈：法币一百六十万万。
    孔：做什么用？
    陈：我买了东西。
    孔：什么东西？
    （陈举起破鞋，孔宋同看）
    宋：老陈，那儿搛的一只破鞋？
    陈：（对宋）你怎么啦！只有共产党，民主同盟和老百姓，才骂我们“国民大会”是破鞋，你怎么也说是破鞋，我看，你怕赤化了。
    宋：不是破鞋，你这是什么？
    陈：这明明是“国民大会”坐位抽签的号码。蒋主席命令我召开“国民大会”。（向孔）拿钱来！
    孔：狗屁，旧国大代表都是你的私党，臭得没人闻，你得多找几个像样的人，我才拿钱。
    陈：（向观众，把钞票花喇喇一拨）谁愿出席我的国大？（观众不应，嘘嘘讥刺。）
    陈：（怒目把破鞋一挥）不出席国大打死你们！
    观众高呼：反对一党国大，反对独裁！
    陈：（要流氓）好，你们不来有人来。喂！拉上来。（一兵牵一狗上，脖子挂一牌，上写“曾琦”，下注“青年党代表”）你要参加“国民大会”！
    曾：（扭头作不愿状）汪，汪，汪！
    陈：怎么，你敢不去。你舐过汪精卫的屁股，我要揭出你当汉奸的证据！
    曾：（磕头乞怜）汪，汪，汪！
    陈：好，那么去吧，（抽一签插曾尾巴上，向兵）那一只呢！
    兵：张君励么？他不肯出场，他表示愿去，就是要吃这个。（指法币）
    陈：好！（抓了一把法币）拿去喂他，告诉他，愿去也得去，不愿去也得去！（兵牵曾下）
    蒋：（上场）都预备好了吗？
    陈：预备好了，主席，你看，这是国民大会坐位抽签的号码，这是第一号，这里是暗号，你就朝这里抽，保险第一号。这样看起来才够“民主”啊！
    蒋：这还是小事，赶紧通令各报馆，在开国民大会期间，一切战报不准发表，尤其是胜利消息，因为我们下了“停战令”。
    陈：是（陈诚从右口上，左手缠着绷带，悬在颈上。）
    陈诚：报告主席，我回来了。
    蒋：你回来了吗？
    陈诚：是，我从前线刚回来。
    蒋：从前线来，你这个样子可不要见新闻记者，也不要发表谈话，我们正要开国大，一切战报，特别是打胜仗的消息，不准发表。
    陈诚：是的，报告主席，我们决不发表打胜仗的消息。
    蒋：你明白这是为了什么吗？
    陈诚：明白。
    蒋：明白什么？
    陈诚：这是为了……
    蒋：为了什么？
    陈诚：这是为了我们从来就没有打过胜仗。
    蒋：胡说，这是为了欺骗老百姓，我们要开“国大”。
    陈诚：真的，报告主席，我们从来没打过胜仗。
    蒋：混蛋，我们的美国大炮呢？
    陈诚：报告主席，我们的美国大炮都丢了，我们占了一百多座空城市。
    蒋：（高兴）对，这不就是胜利消息吗？
    陈诚：可是………
    蒋：可是什么？
    陈诚：可是我们丢了四十五个旅，六万伪军还在外。
    蒋：混蛋，你们那些旅长怎么指挥的？
    陈诚：报告主席，旅长一级，打死的打死，俘虏的俘虏，已经有四十多名啦！
    蒋：混蛋！
    陈诚：是。
    蒋：混蛋！
    陈诚：是。
    蒋：混蛋、混蛋、混蛋！
    陈诚：是、是、是。（士兵从右口上）
    兵：报告主席，请接电话。
    蒋：我气的不行了，立夫，替我接接电话吧！（陈立夫接电话。）
    陈：喂！甚么，有十三万民变军，这么多老百姓造反，四川、湖南、湖北……都有，怎么这多，唉呀！喂，不准在报上发表，听到了没有，不准发表。
    蒋：甚么？
    陈：（故示镇静）没有甚么，没有甚么！
    蒋：到底有什么事？
    陈：（欺骗地）有十三个老百姓造反、人数很少，只十三个。
    蒋：（不在意）十三个，那不要紧，他们都是共产党，给我统统杀了！（兵上）
    兵：报告主席，不是十三个，是十三万！
    蒋：（吃惊地）唉呀，十三万呀！这么多。
    陈：（愤怒地对兵）混蛋，你知道甚么，滚下去！（兵下）
    孔：报告主席，我的机子印得太多太快了，也垮啦；票子越出越不值钱了。
    蒋：（怒）混蛋，你们这些人，太不爱惜我了……我的美国大炮……我的四十五个旅，我的旅长……都完了，现在，又是十三万老百姓造反，你把中央票子也快搞垮啦！你这混蛋。
    孔：（生气）这怪我？！老子不干了。
    陈：你不干尽管走，老子正想干，我说主席，不要紧，他们都是混蛋，我还有两个办法，同时并进。我们一面召开国大，一面进攻延安。天总会保佑我们的胜利的。
    蒋：立夫说的对，天总要保佑我们胜利的，他们太混蛋。
    陈：对，主席，他们都是些混蛋。
    孔（骂陈）：你舐什么屁股！
    陈：你管不着，老子不尿你。
    孔：老子不喝水。
    陈：你狗日的管僚资本！
    孔：你狗日的特务政治！（二人由骂而打，孔被陈打倒在地，场后嘶嘶之声大作，宋与陈诚亦作嘶嘶之声，陈诚指陈立夫：“该打，该打”。）
    蒋：（对宋与陈诚）你们快来维持秩序。（宋上前将陈、孔拉开）
    陈诚：你他妈太厉害了，国民大会主席团，你们ＣＣ就占了一多半，我们复兴没有几个人，你他妈的该死！
    陈：那党务工作就归我管么！
    陈诚：你管，你上前方打仗去！
    陈：放屁！
    陈诚：该杀！
    （二人又由骂而打，陈立夫跑上去想打陈诚，被陈诚一脚踢倒，孔亦帮着扭打，宋拉架，闹做一团。）
    蒋：（气极，大喝）不要再吵了，你们都太不以我为重，太不以国家为重，现在，共产党还有这大的势力，我的统一还没有完成，你们还在吵什么！吵垮了台，老百姓一个一个把你们宰了！嗳，气死我啦。（气得晕倒椅上，宋孔急扶住他。）
    宋：主席，不要紧，还有我们干爸爸美国做靠山呢！
    （电话铃急响。陈诚接。）
    陈诚：喂，喂，怎么。美国…美国物价下跌，存货过多，今年明年一定脱不过经济恐慌！……噢！噢！（挂上电话转脸向宋）你说那靠山，也不过是一个冰山啊！
    蒋：（上去听到电话，本来睁开了眼，这时“唉”的一声长叹，头又挂了下去。
    兵上喊：（“报告，电报”，交宋下。）
    宋：拆看，上海、天津的小贩们闹罢工了！
    陈：（指孔）你看，这都是你要独占市场，逼成的！
    宋：（又一张一张念）刘伯承军新年攻陷聊城、巨野、嘉祥、翼城、……嗳呀，不得了，山东我们的嫡系部队，进攻临沂失败，损失四个旅，两万七千多人，……（抖颤）屁股后也打起来了，苏豫皖共军占领涡阳！……急电：刘伯承在鱼台又歼灭了我们一万人，又俘虏了一个旅长，哎呀，我的妈呀！
    陈：（向陈诚）你打的什么仗，呸，常败将军！（陈诚方要回话，外面口号声大起“惩办无耻兽军！”“美军滚出中国去！”“反对内战！”）
    兵：（急冲上）不好了，不好了，好几万学生的游行大队冲过来了！（下）
    蒋：（一倔而起）怎么会事？
    宋：一定是美国兵强奸北大女生的事，惹出乱子啦！
    蒋：（向陈）你办的什么事，不是叫你禁止登报吗？
    孔、陈诚：（齐向陈立夫）学生都管不了，你办的什么事？养的特务都是死猪！
    （呼声越来越近，男、女、大、小四个学生执旗由右门上，蒋等四人急躲到左角，伏地战栗。）
    学生：（向观众）同胞们，蒋介石把美国军队请来帮他打内战。美国鬼子兵，到处压死人、奸淫我们男女同胞！现在又在北平大街上强奸了一个女学生。同胞们啊，我们打了八年血仗，刚把日本鬼子打走，红毛鬼子又来糟踏我们的姐妹，……（哭、稍停。）同胞们我们来高呼：反对美军暴行！
    观众：反对美军暴行！
    女：美军滚出中国去！
    观众：美军滚出中国去！
    大学生：这些侮辱都是蒋介石招来的，他从天上卖到地下，现在把中国姐妹们的身体也卖了。我们要反对不要？
    观众高呼：反对蒋介石出卖中国！
    大：他签的“中美商约”算数不算数？
    观众高呼：取消中美商约！
    大：这一年为什么不能和平？就是因为蒋、宋、孔、陈四大家族捣乱。我们要他们恢复和平，停止内战！
    观众：停止内战！
    大：我们要逼他恢复政协路线！
    观众：恢复政协路线！
    大：（向其余学生）让我们问他恢复不恢复。
    四学生：（逼向蒋等）恢复不恢复？
    （蒋等耳语，各作丑态。这时马忽从中门伸头探望，蒋等硬起来说：“不恢复！”）
    观众高呼：反对美军暴行，美军立即退出中国！反对美国助蒋内战！（马赶快缩下头去。）
    大：他们不恢复怎么办？
    观众高呼：打！打！打！反对蒋介石出卖中国！恢复政协路线！
    （大学生把旗子一挥，四人一齐大步向蒋等逼进！观众高声唤“打”，蒋等抱头鼠窜溜钻进幕内。）
