Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 28th: A dispatch from Beiping on the 25th states: Since the CCP delegation to the Changchun branch of the Military Mediation Headquarters was placed under armed surveillance by the Kuomintang authorities on the 16th and lost its freedom of movement, efforts by the CCP side of the Beiping Military Mediation Headquarters to restore contact with them have failed due to obstruction by the Kuomintang. At the same time, the U.S. side of the Beiping Military Mediation Headquarters refused to resume flights to Changchun and Harbin, so the CCP delegation to the Changchun branch is now in a state of complete isolation, and the CCP side of the Executive Headquarters is extremely worried about their safety. A spokesman for the CCP delegation to the Beiping Military Mediation Headquarters pointed out: The Changchun incident on the 16th of this month was a long-planned decision by a responsible person on the government side. The statement issued by the government side to reporters on the 17th, fully agreeing with the Changchun authorities' illegal and chaotic actions, is clear evidence of this. On the 20th of this month, the CCP side decided to send Captain Wang Liangke, who had come to Beiping from Changchun a week earlier, to Changchun to investigate the facts, but Cai Wenzhi, the chief of staff on the government side of the Military Mediation Headquarters, stated that he could not guarantee Captain Wang's safety. Today (the 25th), the CCP side made further representations, but Cai Wenzhi again refused, and the U.S. side told the CCP side that if CCP personnel were to fly to Changchun, they could not guarantee that the government troops at Changchun Airport would not open fire. Cai Wenzhi's vicious attitude shows that he has an even greater conspiracy regarding the safety of the CCP personnel in Changchun. Contact between the CCP delegation to the Changchun branch and the Northeast Liberated Area has been severed since December 25th of last year. The CCP side of the Changchun branch has consistently maintained contact with the Harbin Democratic Allied Army Headquarters for the needs of mediation. At the same time, most of the personnel of the branch were sent by the Allied Army Headquarters. In the past, their funds, supplies, and family letters were sent from Harbin to Changchun via Executive Headquarters flights. Shao General Xue Zizheng, Chief of Staff of the CCP side, made two solemn representations to U.S. General Tibo Men on this matter, but both were rejected. This tyrannical decision by the U.S. side coincided with the Kuomintang's atrocities in Changchun, and its purpose may be to create a difficult environment and force the CCP personnel to withdraw from the Executive Headquarters in order to shift the blame for the failure of mediation.

    长春执行分部我代表团失去自由
    蒋美专横拒绝我方调查
    显系逼使中共自执行部撤退
    以便他们推诿调处失败之责
    【新华社延安二十八日电】北平二十五日讯：军调部长春分部中共代表团自十六日被国民党当局武装监视、行动失去自由后，北平军调部中共方面恢复与彼等联络之努力，因受国民党之阻扰，业已失败。同时，北平军调部美方拒绝恢复长春哈尔滨班机，因此长春分部中共代表团现已处于交通完全断绝之被困状态，执行部中共方面对彼等之生命安全极为忧虑。北平军调部中共代表团发言人顷指出：本月十六日之长春事件，系执行政府方面某负责人蓄意已久之决定。十七日政府方面对记者发表之声明，完全同意长春当局之违法乱行，即是明证。本月二十日，中共方面决派遣一周前由长春来平之王良科上尉前往长春调查实况，但军调部政府方面参谋长蔡文治表示不能负责王上尉之安全。本日（二十五日）中共方面再度交涉，蔡文治复又拒绝，并经美方向中共方面表示：如中共方面人员乘机到长，彼等不担保长春机场政府军不加射击。蔡文治此种凶恶态度，昭示彼对长春中共人员安全有更大阴谋。长春分部中共代表团与东北解放区之联络，自去年十二月二十五日后即被断绝。长春分部中共方面因调处之需要，一贯与哈尔滨民主联军总部取得联系。同时，分部之人员亦多系由联军总部派来。彼等之经费、给养及家信，过去均经由执行部班机由哈尔滨送长春。中共方面参谋长薛子正少将曾就此事向美方田博门将军两次严正交涉，俱遭拒绝。美方此种专横决定，与国民党之长春暴行适在同一时期，其目的或在造成困难环境，逼使中共人员自执行部撤退，以便他们诿卸调处失败之责任。
