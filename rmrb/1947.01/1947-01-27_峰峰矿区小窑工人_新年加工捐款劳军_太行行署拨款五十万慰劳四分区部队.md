    Dear Commanders Liu and Deng, and Comrade Frontline Soldiers:

    As we happily welcome 1947, we think of you. We know you have no plans for how to spend the New Year. You are in the cold trenches, planning how to continue to eliminate the enemy, one brigade after another. You are not afraid of bloodshed and will not rest until you defeat the villain Chiang Kai-shek. Who is this all for? What is it for? We know! We are willing to not rest during the New Year, to continue working, to shed our sweat, improve work efficiency, lengthen work hours, and donate all of the 1,880,400 yuan earned from increased production to you as a token of consolation. Comrades, let's do it! In the front, there is your great army, unafraid of bloodshed, and in the rear, there is our great army, unafraid of sweating. Our goals are consistent, our steps are consistent, and united, we will surely defeat the traitor Chiang Kai-shek. We wish you a happy New Year! All workers of the Xiaoyao coal mine in the Fengfeng Mining Area, Ci County.

    [This newspaper, Changzhi News] The Taihang Administrative Office has allocated 500,000 yuan to console the troops of the Fourth Military Subdistrict, and telegraphed Commander He and Political Commissar Liu of the subdistrict to forward the greetings and consolation to all commanders and soldiers.
