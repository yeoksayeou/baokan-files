As the end of the year approaches, in order to ensure that frontline soldiers can fight with peace of mind and guarantee an early victory in the war of self-defense, we should examine the work of supporting the army and giving preferential treatment to military dependents, so as to carry out large-scale activities in this regard as the year closes. Over the past few years, the work of supporting the army and giving preferential treatment to military dependents has achieved great results, and various regions have created a new set of methods and experiences. At the same time, some individual areas still have many shortcomings. Political cadres should first humbly examine themselves, conduct open self-criticism, and truly recognize the importance of supporting the army and giving preferential treatment to military dependents ideologically, and improve this work.

Shortcomings in the work of giving preferential treatment:

First, respect for and care for military dependents and families of revolutionary martyrs has not become a social habit or fostered a social atmosphere. The main problem is that there are many top-down orders but little mobilization of the masses' thinking. The mass line is not followed to mobilize and educate the broad masses to consciously and voluntarily care for and respect military dependents. Therefore, some cadres and the masses regard the work of giving preferential treatment to military dependents as a temporary or seasonal campaign. Therefore, on the issue of giving preferential treatment to military dependents, individual villages are often unenthusiastic, untimely, pushing responsibility upward and treating it as a burden. Other villages care about new soldiers but do not care enough about old soldiers, retired veterans, and families of revolutionary martyrs. Some care about the families of local cadres and local troops, but not enough about the families of field troops. The "Supporting the Army and Giving Preferential Treatment to Military Dependents" pact is not fully implemented, and reception stations exist in name only. The worst (also very isolated) is that preferential treatment grain is embezzled for production, and good grain is replaced with bad grain, and cultivated land is left uncultivated. Some village cadres and activists pay attention, but the masses do not; some masses pay attention, but cadres and activists do not. The importance of giving preferential treatment to military dependents has not become a common understanding of all the masses and cadres. In some counties, the work of giving preferential treatment to military dependents is good in large villages and model villages, but not good in small villages and backward villages. The achievements of models in the work of giving preferential treatment to military dependents have not been widely promoted. Therefore, after the emancipation movement, there are still military dependents who have not established households and cannot be self-reliant. Although these are all individual phenomena, they should attract our sufficient attention and importance. Therefore, we demand that in the future, we must help military dependents establish households and solve their land, production, and livelihood difficulties, so as to achieve the living standards of middle peasants. To make the work of giving preferential treatment to military dependents truly become a social habit and a social atmosphere, this work should be regarded as one of the important contents of social education.

Second, in some individual counties, in the mass movement, insufficient consideration has been given to the distribution of fruits to poor military dependents, which has caused dissatisfaction among some soldiers, resulting in a lack of harmonious relations between the troops and the locality. In the future, special preferential treatment should be given to poor military dependents when distributing fruits. In the process of carrying out the emancipation movement and the production movement, the masses in each village should absorb military dependents to participate, so as to strengthen the unity between the masses and military dependents, between the locality and the army, and consolidate the troops.

Third, insufficient assistance is given to military dependents in matters of marriage and funeral. Preferential treatment to military dependents is generalized, and no special care is given to special difficulties, limited to grain and labor; some are distributed equally, and some only give preferential treatment without explanation or education. Insufficient care is given to villages with particularly many military dependents. Therefore, in the future, different care should be given to different military dependents, and different difficulties should be solved differently; special attention should be paid to solving the problems of military dependents with special difficulties. Counties with a large number of military dependents should be unified and coordinated.

Of course, there are still many commendable achievements that cannot be denied. Because in the past, in carrying out this work in counties, districts, and villages, we did not have enough contact with the troops, so that individual comrades in the troops heard one-sided reflections and believed that the local authorities did not take care of military dependents. In the future, local authorities should contact the troops and regularly report the work of giving preferential treatment to military dependents to the troops. The heads of the garrison troops should be invited to participate in the county and village preferential treatment committees to inspect the work of giving preferential treatment to military dependents. The government should regularly send representatives to the troops to report on the work of giving preferential treatment to military dependents and solicit the opinions of soldiers in order to improve the work of giving preferential treatment to military dependents. The village preferential treatment committee should regularly contact the soldiers from this village who are serving in the military, report on the treatment of their families, so as to encourage their combat morale and make the relationship between the military and the people, between the army and the locality, more harmonious and united.

Several tasks should be carried out at present:

(1) Before the Lunar New Year, county, district, and village governments should organize inspection teams to go to various villages to visit military dependents in conjunction with winter schools, inspect the work of giving preferential treatment to military dependents, specifically solve the difficulties of military dependents, and discover problems. For districts and villages that do not care about military dependents, opinions from all parties should be collected and improved. Those who care about military dependents and have achieved results in giving preferential treatment to military dependents should be commended, and their experience should be summarized so as to promote and commend model military dependents, model preferential treatment, and model support of the army. In short, after inspection, the work of giving preferential treatment to military dependents should be greatly promoted as a specific preparation for large-scale activities to support the army and give preferential treatment to military dependents as the year closes. It is necessary to truly improve the above shortcomings and achieve the goal that everyone pays attention to, and every village does a good job in supporting the army and giving preferential treatment to military dependents.

(2) Before the end of the year, we should start to rectify the preferential treatment committees. County chiefs, political commissars, deputy political commissars of independent battalions, and representatives of the garrison troops should personally participate in the deployment and inspection, and summarize the work of giving preferential treatment to military dependents. In the village, the pact on supporting the army and giving preferential treatment to military dependents should be inspected, and the formalism and bureaucratic style in this work should be boldly exposed.

(3) Within one year, we must help all military dependents, retired veterans, and families of revolutionary martyrs to establish households through production, so that every poor military dependent can reach the living standards of middle peasants. We must create a wave of support for the army and giving preferential treatment to military dependents throughout the area, so that everyone recognizes that doing a good job in giving preferential treatment to military dependents is an important link in supporting the front line, consolidating the troops, and guaranteeing the victory of the war of self-defense; it is an important way to unite the military, the government, and the people.

(4) Mobilize teachers in elementary schools in various villages to write letters of comfort to frontline soldiers on behalf of military dependents, so as to encourage the fighting spirit of frontline soldiers.

### 对目前优抗工作的意见

    对目前优抗工作的意见
    年关将到，为使前线战士安心作战，保证自卫战争早日胜利，我们应检查拥军优抗工作，以便年关开展大规模的拥军优抗工作。几年来，拥军优抗工作有很大成绩，各地创造了一套新的办法和经验；同时，个别地区也还存在着不少缺点。政权干部首应虚心检查自己，公开进行自我批评，从思想上真正认识拥军优抗工作的重要性，并改进这一工作。
  优抗工作中的缺点
    首先是没有把尊重与爱护优待抗属形成社会习惯，造成社会风气。主要是自上而下的命令多，从群众思想上发动少。不是走群众路线发动，教育广大群众，自觉自愿的爱护尊重抗属。因此有些干部、群众把优抗工作看成临时性或季节性的突击工作。所以在优待抗属问题上，个别村庄往往是不主动，不及时，上推下做，当成负担。另一些村庄，则对新战士关心，对老战士、荣退军人、烈士家属不够关心。有的对地方干部、地方部队的家属关心，对野战部队的家属不够关心。拥军优抗公约执行的不彻底，招待所有名无实。最坏的（也是极个别的）是把优抗粮贪污做生产，把好粮换成坏粮，代耕地荒芜。有的村干部积极分子注意，群众不注意；有的群众注意，干部积极分子不注意。没有把优抗的重要性变为全体群众干部的共同认识。有的县，大村、模范村优抗工作好，小村、落后村不好，没有把优抗工作中的成绩模范普遍推广。因此在翻身运动后，还有抗属未建立家务，不能自力更生。这些虽说都是些个别现象，但也应引起我们的足够注意和重视，所以我们要求在今后一定帮助抗属建立家务，解决其土地、生产、生活困难，达到中农生活水平。使优抗工作真正成为社会习惯，社会风气，应将优抗工作当做社会教育重要内容之一。
    其次，有个别县份在群运中，对贫苦抗属的果实分配照顾不够，引起部分战士不满，以致部队与地方关系不融洽。今后对贫苦抗属，分配果实时应特别优待。各村群众进行翻身运动与生产运动中，都要吸收抗属参加，以加强群众与抗属、地方与军队的团结，巩固部队。
    再其次，对抗属的婚、丧大事，帮助不够。优抗一般化，对特殊困难，没有特殊照顾，只限于粮食，劳力优待；有的平均分配，有的只优待不解释、不教育。对抗属特别多的村照顾不够。因此今后对不同抗属应不同照顾，不同困难不同解决；特别注意解决有特殊困难的抗属。对一些抗属多的村县，应统一调剂。
    自然，成绩方面，还是很多值得表扬，不能抹煞。由于我们过去在县、区、村进行这一工作中，与部队联系不够，以致有个别部队同志听到片面反映，就认为地方上不照顾抗属。今后地方应与部队取得联系，把优抗工作经常向部队反映。对驻军首长，应聘其参加县、村优抗委员会，检查优抗工作。政府应经常派代表到部队报告优抗工作，征询战士意见，以改进优抗工作。村抗委会应与本村出征战士经常联系，报告其家属优待情况，以鼓励其战斗情绪，使军民关系，军队与地方间更加融洽团结。
  目前应进行几件工作
    （一）县、区、村政府应在旧历年关前组织检查团，到各村结合冬学深入群众作抗属访问，检查优抗工作，具体解决抗属困难，发现问题。对不关心抗属的区、村，应收集各方意见加以改进。对关心抗属，优抗有成绩的，应加表扬，总结其经验，以便推广表扬模范抗属，优抗模范拥军模范。总之，要在经过检查后，把优抗工作大大推进一步，做为年关大规模拥军优抗工作的具体准备。确实做到改进以上缺点，达到人人注意、村村做好拥军优抗工作。
    （二）在年关前，就应着手进行整顿优抗委员会，各县长、政委、独立营副政委、驻军代表应亲自参加布置检查，总结优抗工作。在村内应检查拥军优抗公约，大胆揭发这一工作中的形式主义和官僚主义作风。
    （三）要在一年内从生产中帮助所有抗属、荣退军人、烈士家属建立家务，作到每个贫苦抗属都能达到中农的生活水平。要在全区造成拥军、优抗的热潮，使大家认识作好优抗工作是支援前线，巩固部队，保证自卫战争胜利的重要一环；是使军政民团结的重要办法。
    （四）发动各村小学教员代抗属给前方战士写信慰问，以鼓励前线战士的战斗情绪。
