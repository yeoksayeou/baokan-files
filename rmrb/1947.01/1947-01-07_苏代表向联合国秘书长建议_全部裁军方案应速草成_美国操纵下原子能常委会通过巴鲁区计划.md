Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 1st dispatch: New York - The Soviet Union has recently proposed that a complete disarmament plan, including detailed measures for the international control of atomic bombs and other weapons of mass destruction, should be drafted as soon as possible. This proposal was delivered by the Soviet representative to the United Nations, Gromyko, to the United Nations Secretary-General Lie on December 28. The proposal requests the immediate establishment of a special committee to formulate practical measures regarding the disarmament plan adopted by the General Assembly, and to submit a proposal based on this disarmament plan within one to two months, at the latest three months.

Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 3rd dispatch: According to various reports, after last year's debate, the Atomic Energy Commission finally passed the US representative Baruch's atomic energy control plan on December 20. According to this plan, the permanent members of the Security Council have no veto power in the Atomic Energy Commission. The Soviet representative Gromyko delivered a speech on the 30th, declaring that the US plan violates the General Assembly's resolution on disarmament. The General Assembly had suggested that decisions on disarmament be taken within the framework of the Security Council, and that a regulatory body with full powers be established, and that international control would only be effective if established within the framework of the Security Council. (Note: If the Baruch Plan is implemented, the result is that the Atomic Energy Commission is independent of the Security Council, and the United States attempts to manipulate it.) Gromyko continued: In order to reach an agreement, the Soviet government is still prepared to discuss the US plan in detail. Gromyko also reiterated that if the international convention on the control of atomic energy is in accordance with the UN Charter, the Soviet Union advocates the immediate adoption of this convention. However, most representatives favored the Baruch Plan, and the plan was passed with ten votes, with the Soviet and Polish representatives abstaining. This plan, along with the commission's work report, will soon be submitted to the Security Council.

    苏代表向联合国秘书长建议
    全部裁军方案应速草成
    美国操纵下原子能常委会通过巴鲁区计划
    【新华社延安一日电】纽约讯：苏联顷提议全部裁军方案，其中包括原子弹及其他大批毁灭性武器之国际管制详细办法，应于最近期内草拟完竣。此项建议案系由苏驻联合国代表葛罗米柯于十二月二十八日交付联合国秘书长莱氏，该建议案要求立即成立特别委员会，并制订关于联大所通过之裁军计划的实际措施，并应于一个月至两个月至迟三个月以内根据该裁军计划提出议案。
    【新华社延安三日电】据各方报导：原子能常务委员会在去年争辩之后，终于在十二月二十日通过了美代表巴鲁区的原子能管制计划，根据这一计划，安理会的常任理事国在原子能委员会中，没有否决权。苏代表葛罗米柯曾于三十日发表演说：宣示美国的计划违反联大关于裁军问题的决议。联大曾建议在安理会机构内，采取关于裁军的决定，并成立具有全权的管制机构，而国际管制只有建立在安理会机构之内，始克有效。（按如实行巴鲁区计划，其结果是原子能委员会独立于安理会之外，美国企图操纵）。葛氏继称：为了取得协议，苏政府仍准备详细商讨美方的计划，葛氏并重申设若管制原子能的国际公约适合联合国宪章时，苏联主张即刻通过此项公约，但大多数代表赞成巴鲁区计划，该计划遂以十票通过，苏波代表弃权。这一计划将和该委员会的工作报告，一起即将提交安理会。
