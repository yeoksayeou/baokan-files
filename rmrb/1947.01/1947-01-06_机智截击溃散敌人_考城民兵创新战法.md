    Cunningly Intercepting Routed Enemies
    Kaocheng Militia Innovates Tactics
    [Our newspaper's report from JiluYu, January 1st] The Kaocheng militia, from August 15th to the end of October, fought a total of 40 battles, killing, wounding, and capturing 100 Chiang Kai-shek soldiers, seizing two 82mm mortars, five light and heavy machine guns, over 50 rifles, one grenade launcher, over 500 rounds of ammunition, and 200 hand grenades. They also cooperated with the county brigade in intercepting a vehicle and over 100 artillery shells. The following experiences have been gained in intercepting routed enemies: (1) For intercepting large groups of enemies, it is necessary to ascertain the area and location of the main forces of both sides, understand the enemy's retreat routes and directions, and set up ambushes layer by layer at their possible passing points, intercepting them section by section, continuously expanding the weaknesses in their retreat, and seizing supplies. Do not meet them head-on; adopt flanking attacks, harassing attacks, ambushes, and pursuits, creating opportunities to strike the enemy from behind. (2) For intercepting small groups of enemies, set up ambushes at the places where the enemy is expected to pass. Head-on blocking and interception can be employed; even if our strength is weaker, we can defeat the enemy in a state of panic. (3) Divide the militia into several groups, led by cadres, to capture scattered or small numbers of enemies, which is more effective.

    机智截击溃散敌人
    考城民兵创新战法
    【本报冀鲁豫一日电】考城民兵自八月十五日至十月底共作战四十次，毙伤俘蒋军一百名，缴二八迫击炮两门、轻重机枪五挺、步枪五十余支、掷弹筒一个、子弹五百余发、手榴弹二百颗，并配合县大队截获汽车一辆，炮弹百余发。在截击溃退敌人方面已取得以下几点经验：（一）截击大股之敌的战法，要查明敌我主力作战地区及位置，了解敌撤退道路和方向，在其可能经过之处，层层设伏，节节阻击，不断的扩大其退却中之弱点，截夺物资；不要拦头迎接，应采取侧击、扰击、伏击、追击，随其尾巴制造机会打击敌人。（二）截击小股之敌，预计敌可能经过之处，设置埋伏，可拦头堵击、截击，就是我们力量较弱些，在敌人慌张情况下也可胜敌。（三）把民兵分成若干小组，由干部率领，捕捉零星或少数之敌，更易生效。
