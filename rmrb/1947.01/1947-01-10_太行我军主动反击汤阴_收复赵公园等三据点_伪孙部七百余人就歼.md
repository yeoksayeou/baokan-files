After a day and night of fierce fighting, these three strongholds were recovered. The entire 1st Battalion of the 1st Regiment of the 5th Column of the puppet Sun Dianying's troops guarding the area was annihilated. It is estimated that over 400 were killed or wounded, including their regimental commander Zhu Shurong. Over 300 were captured alive, including their battalion commander Zhang Huanzhang. The spoils included one mortar, three 60mm mortars, 46 light and heavy machine guns, over 200 rifles, over ten warhorses, and over 50,000 rounds of ammunition.
