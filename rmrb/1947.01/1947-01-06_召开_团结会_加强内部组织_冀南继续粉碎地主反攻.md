    [Reported by this newspaper from Weixian on the 1st] Farmers in Jinnan are making persistent efforts to continue smashing the illegal schemes and conspiracies of landlords and thoroughly examine land reform. Xu Si, a local bully landlord in Dadou Village, Ren County, relying on the fact that his brother Xu Wu was a regimental commander in the Chiang Kai-shek army, often spread "change of regime" ideas to intimidate the masses. He once incited 40 farmer members to complain to the district salvation association about the chairman of the farmers' association, tied up the activist Wu Daolin, and attempted to create sectarian contradictions to obstruct the mass movement. During this campaign, he also spread rumors saying: "The district is going to pursue the 2,000 jin of wheat ground for the troops last year, as well as the 2,000 jin of public grain owed in the autumn of the year before last. The district wants to compensate for it from the fruits of the struggle, but the fruits of the struggle are not enough to compensate the public." The masses saw through his conspiracy and launched a struggle against him. Zhang Qingzhen, a landlord in Zhang Hongtun, Wucheng, sent 15 jin of millet to the home of Gao Yugui, the chairman of the farmers' association, one night, attempting to buy him off with petty favors. The next day, Yugui immediately convened a general meeting to expose the landlord's conspiracy and declared that he would never accept bribes. After the meeting, the masses and cadres became more united and carried out a reasoning struggle against Zhang Qingzhen. Han Litang, a landlord in Han Family Village, Gaotang, incited more than 30 farmer members, saying: "The chairman of the farmers' association is corrupt and the accounts are unclear. If poor people want to turn over, they must replace the chairman," and used banquets to win them over. The farmers' association immediately held a unity meeting. The members who had been used reflected on their actions, and the farmers' association also cleared up the accounts, exposing Han Litang's plot. Ji Hongyan, a landlord in Nancun, Ren County, killed Wang Jingxiang, the chairman of the farmers' association, during last year's mass movement, and bought off Wu Qiangyong, the militia captain, and Cao Chenglin, the deputy chairman of the farmers' association, often suppressing activists in the village. During this campaign, they actively applied their habitual tricks. With the support of the government, the masses replaced the militia captain and the deputy chairman of the farmers' association, and launched a struggle against him. Zhu Huiwu, a landlord in Hao Family Village, Wuyi, fabricated ghost apparitions to suppress the mass movement. The village elementary school was renting his house, and Zhu Huiwu often told the elementary school students that his yard was haunted, and gave Wu Yingwen, the head of the children's corps, a pigeon, telling him to pretend to be a ghost, trying every means to get the students to move out. After the village cadres' multiple education efforts, Wu Yingwen revealed the inside story, and the masses were extremely angry and launched a liquidation against Zhu.

    召开“团结会”加强内部组织
    冀南继续粉碎地主反攻
    【本报威县一日电】冀南各地农民再接再厉，继续粉碎非法地主奸计阴谋，彻底检查土地改革。任县大豆村恶霸地主徐四，仗他兄弟徐五是蒋军团长，常常散布“变天”思想，威吓群众，曾挑拨四十个农会员向区救会控告农会主任，捆起积极分子吴道林，企图造成宗派矛盾，阻碍群运。这次运动中他又造谣说：“区里要追去年给部队磨的二千斤麦子，以及前年秋季欠的二千斤公粮，区里叫从果实中赔偿，斗争果实还不够赔偿公家的。”群众识破他的阴谋，向其展开斗争。武城张洪屯地主张庆珍，某夜以小米十五斤送到农会主任高玉贵家里，企图用小惠小恩收买他。第三天，玉贵即召开全体大会，揭露地主阴谋，表白自己决不受贿。会后群众干部更加团结，向张庆珍进行了说理斗争。高唐韩家庄地主韩立堂，挑拨三十多个农会员说：“农会主任贪污，账目不清，穷人要想翻身，必须把主任换下去，”并以酒席拉拢收买。农会当即召开团结会，被利用的会员作了反省，农会也清算了账目，揭破了韩立堂的奸计。任县南村地主季鸿艳在去年群运时将农会主任王景详杀死，并收买民兵队长武强勇，农会副主任曹成林，时常打击村中积极分子。这次运动，他们积极施其惯技。在政府撑腰下，群众撤换了民兵队长及农会副主任，并向他展开斗争。武邑郝家庄地主朱会五，捏造鬼神显灵，压制群运。该村小学借住他家，朱会五经常向小学生说他这院子闹鬼，并给儿童团长武英文一个鸽子，叫他装鬼，想尽方法要学生搬出去。经过村干部多方教育，武英文说出内幕，群众极为愤怒，向朱展开清算。
