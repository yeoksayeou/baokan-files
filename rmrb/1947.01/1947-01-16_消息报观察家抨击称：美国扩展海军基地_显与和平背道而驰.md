TASS, Moscow, December 12th—An observer from *Izvestia* criticized: The U.S. House Naval Affairs Committee has recently passed a report on maintaining and further developing its network of Pacific naval bases. The *Izvestia* observer commented: When no one and nothing threatens the United States, and when disarmament (with U.S. participation) has just been decided, raising the issue of expanding the network of naval bases after the war clearly runs counter to peace. After detailed study, the report passed by U.S. congressmen proves that its content is not limited to expanding naval bases within U.S. territory or its affiliated islands. The report has a broader purpose, planning to establish military bases throughout the Pacific, such as in the former Japanese-mandated islands of the Marshall, Caroline, and Mariana Islands, or in the Japanese Ogasawara and Ryukyu Islands, the fate of which awaits the Allied powers' decision at the upcoming peace conference with Japan. The report also states that U.S. bases should be established on islands currently under British and Australian mandate because "other countries are unable to defend these islands." The authors of the report apparently felt no need to make any concealment in this regard. The report contains such a wonderful discovery as that the northern part of the U.S. central defense line in the Pacific should include the defense facilities of the Aleutian Islands and the Pribilof Islands. It seems that some U.S. congressmen have forgotten that the Kuril Islands are part of the Soviet Union.

### 消息报观察家抨击称：美国扩展海军基地  显与和平背道而驰

　　消息报观察家抨击称：
    美国扩展海军基地  显与和平背道而驰
    【塔斯社莫斯科十二日电】美众院海军委员会顷已通过保持和更进一步发展其太平洋海军基地网之报告。消息报观察家评称：当无人无事威胁美国之时，当裁军（在美国参与之下）刚刚获得决定时，提出战后扩展海军基地网之问题，显与和平背道而驰。美国会议员所通过之报告，详细研究之后，证明其所含内容非仅在美国国土或其所属岛屿内扩展海军基地。该报告有其更为广大之目的，计划于太平洋各地建立军事基地，如前日本委任统治岛屿——马绍尔、加罗林、马里亚那等群岛，或如日属小笠原群岛和琉球群岛，二者命运尚待盟国在即将来临之对日和会上决定。报告又谓：在现英澳委任统治岛屿上建立美基地，因“他国无力保卫这些岛屿”。报告之作者们显然觉得在这方面无需作任何隐讳。该报告含有如此奇妙之发现，如太平洋美国中央防线之北面应包有阿留申群岛与蒲鲁里斯特岛之防御设备。似乎美国竟有国会议员，忘记了千岛群岛乃组成苏联之一部。
