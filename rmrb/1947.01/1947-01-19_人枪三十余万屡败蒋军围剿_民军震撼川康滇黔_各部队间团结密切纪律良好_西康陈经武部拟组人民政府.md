Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 17th: The people's armed uprisings in Sichuan, Xikang, Yunnan, and Guizhou provinces, as of this month, have reached over 320,000 people with guns, according to the highest figures from some newspapers in the Kuomintang-controlled areas. Even using the lowest figures, they exceed 140,000. Chiang Kai-shek's Chongqing Headquarters and the Xichang Garrison Command are urgently dispatching their three brigades stationed on the Sichuan-Xikang border, the Air Force Commission's Special 7th Brigade and the 79th Division stationed in Yunnan, to join with the provincial security forces to encircle and suppress the insurgents in the four-province border region. This reflects the vigorous development of the people's armed uprisings. In Xikang, according to Shanghai newspapers, the insurgent forces are known as the Farmers' Self-Defense Army, led by Chen Jingwu as Commander-in-Chief and Li Wuheng and Zhao Guoxiang as Deputy Commanders. They are divided into seven brigades and have put forward the slogan of "Organizing a People's Government." They have already occupied the county towns of Tianquan, Baoxing, and Lushan. It is rumored that they have also occupied Ya'an and Rongjing, but the situation is unclear. They are also advancing towards Mingshan in Sichuan. In Sichuan Province, the people's armed uprisings are estimated to have grown to 200,000 at the highest estimate, and 120,000 at the lowest. The new and old forces consist of over 100 units, spread across over 150 counties in the province. Among them, the most recent to emerge is a unit of tens of thousands in the mountains bordering Sichuan and Xikang, calling themselves the "Democratic People's Army." In the autumn and winter of last year, a unit of over a thousand people appeared between Hongya and Rongjing, armed with two guns per person, as well as machine guns and mortars. The Hu Guoguang unit in Pingshan County is said to have over 3,000 people, as well as the units of Ma Chunti and other gentry in Maogong. The relationship between the various units and the people is good. Some units have a considerable degree of unity and cooperation to avoid being defeated piecemeal by Chiang's troops. For example, Yin Lucai, Zeng Ziming, and 17 other insurgent leaders on the Sichuan-Yunnan-Guizhou border have jointly formed the "Sichuan-Yunnan-Guizhou General Headquarters," with their subordinate units stationed in various locations, forming a mutually supportive network. The counties of Xuyong and others have also formed a "Green Forest General Headquarters," alarming Chiang Kai-shek's Chongqing Headquarters, which has sent people to investigate secretly. Furthermore, the Chen and Li units in Hongya, the Huarong troops, and others are closely cooperating and supporting each other. Various units have successively besieged the county towns of Tongjiang, Da County, and Maogong. In Wangcang, they once captured all the guns of a detective brigade. In Chongqing, they once killed or captured 30 to 40 security team members and seized field guns, machine guns, and other weapons. The strength of the Sichuan people's armed uprisings is such that the Shanghai United Evening News called the province "a powder keg that could explode at any time," and the Chengdu Huaxi Evening News editorial said, "The Sichuan authorities have become a boiling cauldron." According to extremely incomplete statistics from newspapers in Yunnan Province, the people's armed uprisings number at least over 20,000 people, consisting of approximately 20 units. Among them, the largest is the Yi ethnic armed force in Yongsheng area, north of the Jinsha River in western Yunnan, with over 10,000 people and guns. The next largest are the dozen or so units in the northeastern counties of Yunnan, with approximately 6,000 to 7,000 people. There are five units in southern Yunnan, with approximately 2,000 to 3,000 people. Even the Chiang government's Yunnan Garrison Command admits that there are over 10,000 people in the province. In Guizhou, according to the Guiyang Central Daily News and Guizhou Daily, there is insurgent activity in Zhijin, Qianxi (county name), Jinsha, Dading, Tongzi, Renhuai, and other counties.

　　人枪三十余万屡败蒋军围剿
    民军震撼川康滇黔
    各部队间团结密切纪律良好
    西康陈经武部拟组人民政府
    【新华社延安十七日电】川、康、滇、黔四省民变武装，截至本月份止，如以蒋区各地一部分报纸之最高数字计算，已达人枪三十二万以上，依最低数字计算，亦超过十四万。蒋介石重庆行辕及西昌警备司令部，正急忙派遣其驻川康边的三个旅、驻云南的航委会特七旅与七十九师等部，会同各省保安团队向四省边境变民进剿。这反映出民变武装正蓬勃发展。西康方面，据沪报称：民变部队号称农民自卫军，以陈经武为总司令，李兀亨、赵国祥为副司令部分，共分七个旅，并提出“组织人民政府”口号，已占领天全、宝兴、芦山三县城，有传且已占领雅安、荣经，情况不明，并向四川之名山推进中。四川全省民变武装据最高估计，已发展至廿万，最低数字亦为十二万，新旧部队共百余单位，遍及全省一百五十余县，其中最近出现者有川康交界山中一部，数达万人，自称“民主人民军”。在去年秋冬间，新出现者有洪雅、荣经间一部千余人，人尽双枪，有机枪迫击炮等武器。屏山县胡国光部，据称有三千余人，及懋功绅士马春体等部。各部队与人民关系良好。若干部队有相当高度的团结合作精神，以避免蒋军各个击破。如川、滇、黔边境的殷禄才，曾子明等十七位变民领袖合组“川滇黔总司令部”，所属各分驻各地，互成犄角之势。叙永等县继亦组成“绿林总司令部”，使重庆蒋介石行辕为之吃惊，而派人前往密查。再如洪雅之陈、李两部，华荣部队等均密切合作，互相呼应，各地部队曾先后围攻通江、达县、懋功等县城，在旺苍曾一次缴获一个侦缉大队的全部枪械，在崇庆曾一次毙俘保安队三四十名，缴获野炮、机枪等武器。四川民变武装声势之盛，沪联合晚报谓该省为“随时有爆发可能的火药库”，蓉华西晚报社论说：“四川当局已成鼎沸”。云南全省民变武装照各地报纸极不完全的数字统计，至少为二万余人，共约二十个单位。其中以滇西金沙江北岸永胜一带反抗蒋政府之夷族武装力量最大，人枪一万余，次为滇东北各县十余部，共约六七千，滇南五部，共约二三千。即蒋政府云南警备司令部亦承认全省共有万余。贵州民变武装，据贵阳中央日报贵州日报等载，织金、黔西（县名）、金沙、大定、桐梓、仁怀等县均有变民活动。
