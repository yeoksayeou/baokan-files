　　Farmers Actively Help the Government Overcome Financial Difficulties
    Heilongjiang Province Completes Autumn Grain Collection
    Hailun and 27 Other Counties Over-fulfill Grain Quota by 80,000 Tons
    [Our Newspaper] The autumn grain collection work in Heilongjiang Province has been fully completed, and some areas have even exceeded their tasks. The province suffered a fairly severe drought last year, but thanks to the leadership of people's governments at all levels and the active drought resistance efforts of the broad masses of farmers, a harvest of more than 75% was ultimately achieved. In order to help the government overcome difficulties and balance national financial revenue and expenditure, farmers in various places did not delay the payment of public grain due to the poor harvest. After the government's task assignment for public grain collection was issued, their morale was extremely high, and they enthusiastically paid their dues. By January 25th, the entire public grain collection work for 1949 was successfully completed, and 28 counties exceeded their tasks, delivering an additional 80,000 tons of public grain. The Provincial People's Government has decided to hand over all the surplus public grain to the state to support the liberation of Taiwan, Hainan Island, and Tibet, as well as the recovery and development of heavy industry in Northeast China.
    Among the 28 counties that exceeded their tasks, Hailun, Tao'an, and Longjiang exceeded the most. The quality of the public grain collected this time is also good. According to statistics, first-grade grain (98% pure grain) accounted for 53% of the total public grain; second-grade grain (over 96% pure millet and corn, over 94% pure soybeans and sorghum) accounted for 44% of the total public grain; third-grade grain and below accounted for only 3% of the total. Among the soybeans delivered, first-grade soybeans accounted for 57% of the total number of soybeans. Tailai, Suihua, Wangkui, Qing'an, and Fuyu performed the best in this regard. Except for a very small amount of second-grade grain, the rest was all first-grade grain.
    The main reasons why the public grain collection was completed ahead of schedule and exceeded the task are as follows: First, the correct leadership of the Northeast People's Government and the fairness and rationality of the Grain Collection Regulations. Second, the timely mobilization by Party organizations at all levels under the leadership of the Provincial Party Committee and the active responsibility of cadres and Party members at all levels. Third, the generally enhanced awareness of all farmers and model workers, who expressed heartfelt love for the motherland and sincerely supported Chairman Mao, thus paying public grain with great enthusiasm.

　　农民积极帮助政府克服财政困难
    黑龙江省秋征完成
    海伦等二十八县多交公粮八万吨
    【本报讯】黑龙江省秋征工作已全部完成，若干地区并已超过任务。该省去年曾受相当严重的旱灾，但由于各级人民政府的领导与广大农民积极展开抗旱斗争，终获七成五以上年景。各地农民为帮助政府克服困难，平衡国家财政收支，并未因歉收而缓交公粮。在政府公粮征收任务分配下达后，情绪均极高涨，踊跃交纳。至一月二十五日，一九四九年度的全部征收公粮工作胜利完成，并有二十八个县超过任务，多交公粮八万吨。该省人民政府已决定将该批超额公粮全部交给国家作为支援解放台湾、海南岛、西藏与恢复发展东北重工业之用。
    在超过任务的二十八个县中，以海伦、洮安、龙江超过最多。这次公粮质量亦好。据统计：一等粮（纯粮百分之九十八）占全部公粮数目百分之五十三；二等粮（谷子、苞米纯粮百分之九十六以上，大豆、高粱纯粮百分之九十四以上）占全部公粮百分之四十四；三等粮和三等以下的只占全部的百分之三；所交大豆中一等大豆占全部大豆数百分之五十七。其中以泰来、绥化、望奎、庆安、富裕为最好。除极少数二等粮外，余均为一等粮。
    此次公粮之所以能提前完成并超过任务，其主要原因有以下三点：第一、是东北人民政府的正确领导，征粮条例规定的公平合理。第二、是省委领导各级党组织及时动员与各级干部党员的积极负责。第三、是全体农民与劳动模范觉悟的普遍提高对祖国表现衷心的热爱竭诚拥护毛主席，故交纳公粮，极为踊跃。
