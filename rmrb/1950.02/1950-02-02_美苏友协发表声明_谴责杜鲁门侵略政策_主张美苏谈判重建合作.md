Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, January 31st: TASS, New York, January 27th reports: The National Committee of the American-Russian Institute issued a statement to the press condemning Truman's message, saying that Truman's recent message to Congress was tantamount to telling Congress and the nation, as well as the world, that the U.S. government intends to continue the Cold War in all aspects, with increasing intensity. Truman is unafraid of the fact that the American people are groaning under the heavy burden of military spending and casually proposes to use more than 70 percent of the $42.4 billion budget for military purposes.

The statement pointed out that the complete bankruptcy of the US military strategy runs the risk of plunging the United States into complete isolation. Monopoly capitalists and their international cartels reap huge profits from rearmament, while the entire American economy is in danger of stagnation because heavy industry is resisting the most profitable markets in the Soviet Union and the new democratic countries, which are being rebuilt at an unprecedented rate. This situation also certainly applies to China's new market.

The statement declared: In the United States, peace is gaining momentum. Even Truman's message, though ambiguous and cleverly evasive, cannot help but reflect this growing peaceful sentiment among many people of different occupations in our country. This sentiment is bound to develop into a powerful demand for peace and friendship with the Soviet Union, the Eastern European democracies, China, and all the nations of Asia. We should demand peace from our congressmen and senators. We must demand an end to the trade boycott of 800 million people—one-third of all mankind. We must demand that the Truman administration accept the Soviet Union's proposal to hold a meeting to review and negotiate all outstanding issues between the United States and the Soviet Union, with the aim of reaching an agreement and rebuilding cooperation. We must demand immediate recognition of China. These practical measures will make it possible for the American people to participate in the resolution of peace issues. The adoption of these measures can bring glory and security to us and the world.

　　美苏友协发表声明
    谴责杜鲁门侵略政策
    主张美苏谈判重建合作
    【新华社北京三十一日电】据塔斯社纽约二十七日讯：美苏友好协会全国委员会对报界发表声明，谴责杜鲁门的咨文称，杜鲁门最近致国会的咨文，等于是告诉国会和全国以及全世界说，美国政府打算在各方面有增无已地继续进行冷战。杜鲁门对于美国人民正在军费重负之下呻吟着的事实，无所忧惧，并随便地提出在四百二十四亿美元的预算中，将百分之七十以上用在军事方面。
    声明指出，美国军事战略的完全破产，有使美国陷入完全孤立的危险。垄断资本家与他们的国际卡迭尔从重整军备上获得巨大的利润，而整个的美国经济却有着停滞的危险，因为重工业在抵制那正在以空前速度进行重建的苏联与新民主国家内的最有利可图的市场。这种情形当然也适用于中国的新市场。
    声明宣称：在美国，和平正在日渐得势。就连杜鲁门的咨文，虽然内容含糊而且巧妙地闪烁其辞，也不免反映着我国各种不同职业的许多人民的这种正在增长的和平情绪。这种情绪必然会蔚成一种强有力的要求，要求和平和与苏联、东欧民主国家、中国以及亚洲一切民族建立友谊。应该向我们的众议员和参议员要求和平。我们必须要求停止对八万万人——全人类的三分之一——的贸易抵制。我们必须要求杜鲁门政府接受苏联的建议，开一次会议来检讨并谈判美苏两国间一切悬而未决的问题，目的是获致协议，重建合作。我们必须要求立刻承认中国。这些切实的办法，会使美国人民有可能参加和平问题的解决。这些办法的采行，可以使我们和世界获得光荣和安全。
