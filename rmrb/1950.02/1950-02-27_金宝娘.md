Jin Bao's Mother
　　Xing Lian (Painting)
　　(Based on Ma Feng's novel: "A Lowly Woman")
　　(Thirteen)
　　When Genyuan was twenty, Cuicui was already eighteen. Her parents saw that they were grown up, so in the autumn they arranged for Cuicui to have her hair put up [a sign of adulthood/marriage]. The day before, they sent Cuicui to Genyuan's second aunt's house, and the next day they pulled a donkey cart to bring her back, kowtowed to heaven and earth, ate a simple cake, and that was considered a marriage. Although she was a girl who had grown up in the same village, many people came to see her as a potential wife, and everyone praised her: "Truly a good wife, even the Liu the wealthy landlord's family doesn't have such a good wife."

　　(Fourteen)
　　The landlord Liu Guicai had long been eyeing Cuicui, constantly trying to seduce her. He would sit idly at Genyuan's house for no reason, and if he found nobody at home, he would strike up a conversation with Cuicui, showing off his gold ring to see how heavy it was, and taking out a handkerchief to let Cuicui recognize whether it was silk or hemp. Cuicui was so angry that whenever Liu Guicai came, she would sweep the floor and the kang [heated brick bed], deliberately making the whole room dusty.

　　(Fifteen)
　　In the second year after Cuicui got married, her father-in-law died, and in the winter she gave birth to a boy, which delighted the whole family immensely. They named him Jinbao. Liu Guicai still hadn't given up, and often wandered around Genyuan's house, sometimes pulling and tugging, nudging Cuicui with his elbow. That autumn, Genyuan came back from harvesting grain in the field, and heard Cuicui shouting in the room.

　　(Sixteen)
　　Genyuan rushed in and saw Cuicui huddled in the corner of the kang, Liu Guicai holding Cuicui with one hand and two banknotes in the other. Genyuan shouted angrily: "What are you doing?" Liu Guicai said, "Collecting rent." Saying that, he jumped off the kang. Genyuan said, "You want rent, so you come to my kang to collect it?" (Attached picture)

　　根元二十岁上，翠翠已经十八了。爹娘看见都大了，秋天就给翠翠挽了头。前一天把翠翠送到根元的二姨家，第二天拉了毛驴接回来，拜了天地，吃顿素糕，就算结了婚。虽然是从小在一村长大的闺女，但看媳妇的人可不少，大家都称赞：“真是个好媳妇，就是刘大财主家也没有这样的好媳妇。”
　　（十四）
　　地主刘贵财早就看上了翠翠，时时刻刻想勾搭。有事没事就到根元家闲坐，遇着家里没人，就搭揽和翠翠说话，露出金戒指让翠翠看有多重，拿出手绢让翠翠认是丝是麻。翠翠气的逢到刘贵财来，就扫地扫炕，故意闹得满屋尘土。
　　（十五）
　　翠翠结婚第二年，公公就死了，冬天生了个小子，一家人喜的了不得，起名叫金宝。刘贵财仍然没有死心，还常常到根元家闲溜，有时拉拉扯扯，用肘碰碰翠翠。这年秋天，根元从地里割谷回来，听着翠翠在房里叫喊。
　　（十六）
　　根元忙跑进去，见翠翠缩在炕角里，刘贵财一手拉着翠翠，一手拿着两张票子。根元气得大声喊道：“你干什么？”刘贵财说：“要租子。”说着跳下炕来。根元说：“要租子到我家炕上要来？”（附图片）
