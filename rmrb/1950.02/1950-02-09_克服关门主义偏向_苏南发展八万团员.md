　　Overcoming Closed-Door Tendencies
　　Sunan Develops 80,000 Youth League Members
　　[Our Newspaper] The Sunan District Communist Youth League Working Committee convened its second expanded meeting last month in Wuxi City. Attendees included the heads of the District League Working Committee and its four subordinate special district League Working Committees, as well as the Wuxi and Suzhou City League Working Committees. The meeting reviewed the organizational development of the Youth League from the first expanded meeting in October of last year to the end of December and put forward the main requirements for future League building work. According to reports from various localities, the Youth League has made great progress in its organization over the past six months. As of the beginning of January, the total number of League members in the district had reached 80,000. Among them, peasant youth accounted for more than 50,000 (poor and hired peasants accounting for over 80%), and worker youth numbered 7,000. During this period, various localities overcame the closed-door tendencies of various periods and in various forms, resolutely implemented the correct policy of open League building, and developed and strengthened the League in various movements, making the League a powerful assistant to the Communist Party and the People's Government. For example, worker League members played an active role in production and thrift campaigns, learning, resolving labor-management disputes, and annual bonus issues; peasant League members played an active role in flood prevention and disaster relief, summer grain requisitioning and autumn tax collection, suppressing bandits and self-defense, anti-despot struggles, anti-black landlords, and rent reduction movements. They cooperated with the trade unions and peasant associations to ensure and complete the tasks assigned by the Party and the government ahead of schedule. The broad masses of League members have also continuously improved through the tempering of various movements. They have made great progress in collectivist ideas, hard work style, organization, and discipline.
　　The meeting examined the problems currently existing in the Sunan Youth League, mainly that the organizational strength of the entire League is far from being fully utilized. Most League members are only working actively as individuals; some branches lack a clear division of labor and planning; and some have inappropriately emphasized the exemplary role of League members. As a result, League members are too busy with work, attend too many meetings, appear to be doing everything for everyone, are mired in bureaucracy, and create isolation of the League from the masses. In addition, the development of the League in various aspects is uneven, and the League's work among workers is relatively backward. The meeting decided on the following specific tasks for the future: (1) Require the entire district to widely carry out League building. In the rent reduction work, ensure that each county and district can establish a key township branch; establish branches in general factories and cities with industrial workers; develop shop assistant work in major towns in a focused manner; strengthen League building among teachers and leadership of the Young Pioneers; and develop effective League friends in a planned manner. (2) Consolidate the League organization vigorously in the movement and in development. This first requires combining with the movement and the masses, and conducting the democratic construction of the League branch openly under leadership. Each county should be required to master at least one typical branch, cultivate cadres in a planned way, and, based on specific circumstances, first propose cadre conditions, establish standards, call on everyone to strive for progress, and conduct democratic elections after a period of deliberation and testing in work. Secondly, strengthen branch education. Short-term training courses can also be held; each city, county, and district with the conditions should also use the spare time of central work to convene League representative meetings to cultivate cadres and strengthen branches through learning at the meetings. (3) Require a wider range of mass work. Go deep into factories, schools, and other production departments to carry out mass sports and recreational activities, and hold various youth knowledge lectures. Carry out propaganda and education work under leadership and in a planned way to strengthen ideological leadership of the youth movement. (Zhang Yongxiang, Fan Gongjian)

　　克服关门主义偏向
    苏南发展八万团员
    【本报讯】苏南区团工委于上月在无锡市召开了第二次扩大会议，出席者有区团工委及所属四个专区团工委和无锡、苏州两市团工委负责人。会上检查了自去年十月第一次扩大会议后至十二月底的建团工作，并提出了今后建团工作的主要要求。据各地汇报，在过去六个月中，青年团在组织上有了很大发展。至一月初，全区团员已达八万人。其中农民青年约占五万余（贫雇农占百分之八十以上），工人青年七千人。在此期间，各地克服了各个时期和各种不同形式的关门主义偏向，坚决贯彻了公开建团的正确方针，在各种运动中发展和壮大了团，使团成为共产党与人民政府的有力助手。如工人团员在生产节约运动、学习、解决劳资争议和年奖问题中；农民团员在防水救灾、夏征秋征、剿匪自卫、反恶霸斗争、反黑田以及减租运动中，都能起积极作用。他们配合了工会、农会，保证并提前完成了党和政府所交给的任务。广大团员在各种运动锻炼中，也不断地提高了。在集体观念，艰苦作风，组织性和纪律性上，都有很大的进步。
    会议检查了目前苏南青年团所存在着的问题，主要是发挥整个团的组织力量非常不够。大多数团员仅是个人积极工作；某些支部中缺乏明确分工和计划；有的还不适当地强调了团员的模范作用。因此团员工作太忙，开会太多，显得对于工作包办代替，陷于事务主义，并形成团在群众中的孤立。此外，团在各方面发展不平衡，在工人中团的工作相对落后。会上决定了今后的具体任务：（一）要求全区普遍开展建团，在减租工作中，做到每县、每区都能建立一重点乡支部；在一般工厂、有产业工人的城市，普遍成立支部；主要城镇并应有重点地开展店员工作；加强教师中的建团工作以及少年儿童队的领导；并有计划地发展有作用的团友。（二）要在运动中在发展中大力巩固团的组织。这首先是结合运动，结合群众，有领导地公开地进行团支部的民主建设。要求每县都能至少掌握一个典型支部，有计划地培养干部，并根据具体情况在团员中先提出干部条件，树立标准，号召大家努力进步，经一定时期的酝酿和在工作中的考验后进行民主选举。其次是加强支部教育。同时可举办短期轮训班；各市、县以及有条件的区并应利用中心工作的空隙时间，普遍召开团的代表会议，通过会议上的学习来培养干部与加强支部。（三）要求更广泛地开展群众工作。深入工厂，学校及其他生产部门，开展群众性的体育、文娱活动，举办各种青年知识讲座等。有领导有计划地进行宣教工作，以加强对青年运动的思想领导。（张镛祥、范恭俭）
