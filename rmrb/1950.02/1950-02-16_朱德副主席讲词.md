Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, February 15th: Vice Chairman Zhu De's speech at tonight's banquet:

Gentlemen, Comrades:

The Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance, recently concluded in Moscow by Chairman Mao Zedong and Premier Zhou Enlai with Marshal Stalin and Foreign Minister Vyshinsky, was signed in Moscow yesterday. This marks a new historical stage in the relations between China and the Soviet Union. This is a major event in world history. These treaties and agreements further unite the peoples of China and the Soviet Union, and further guarantee the cause of world peace. These treaties and agreements fully demonstrate the friendship of the great socialist country, the Soviet Union, towards the Chinese people. The Chinese people, who have suffered from war for a long time, have received great assistance from the Soviet Union, which will undoubtedly play a significant role in the recovery and development of the new China's economy.

The stipulations in the agreement regarding the Chinese Changchun Railway, Lushun, and Dalian, as well as the notes regarding the Sino-Soviet transfer of property obtained by Soviet economic organizations in Northeast China from Japanese owners and the Soviet government's unconditional transfer of all property of the former Beijing barracks to the People's Republic of China, have thoroughly shattered the long-standing provocative conspiracies of the American imperialists and their running dogs in China.

There is no doubt that the signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance will be supported by peace-loving people all over the world, and will cause great excitement among the Chinese people. The American imperialists and their running dogs will be utterly embarrassed in the face of the great unity of the Chinese and Soviet peoples.

Long live the great unity of the Chinese and Soviet peoples!
Long live Marshal Stalin!
Long live Chairman Mao Zedong!

　　朱德副主席讲词
    【新华社北京十五日电】朱德副主席在今晚宴会上的演讲词：
    各位先生，各位同志：
    最近在莫斯科由毛泽东主席、周恩来总理与斯大林大元帅、维辛斯基外长谈判缔结的中苏友好同盟互助条约，已于昨天在莫斯科签字了。这标志着中苏两国关系的新的历史阶段。这是世界历史上的一件大事。这些条约和协定使得中苏两国人民更进一步地团结起来，全世界人民保卫和平的事业也由此得到了更进一步的保障。这些条约和协定充分地表现了伟大的社会主义国家苏联对于中国人民的友谊。长时期内遭受战争损害的中国人民得到了苏联的伟大援助，对于新中国经济的恢复与发展，无疑地会有重大的作用。
    协定中关于中长路、旅顺、大连的规定，以及中苏关于苏联经济机关在东北自日本所有者手中所获得的财产、和苏联政府过去在北京兵营的全部财产无偿地移交中华人民共和国的照会，使得美帝国主义者和他们在中国的走狗们历来的挑拨阴谋彻底地被粉碎了。
    毫无疑义，中苏友好同盟互助条约的签订，必将受到全世界爱好和平的人们的拥护，我们中国人民更将引起很大的兴奋，而美帝国主义者和他的走狗们则会在中苏两国人民的伟大团结面前狼狈不堪。
    中苏两国人民的伟大团结万岁！
    斯大林大元帅万岁！
    毛泽东主席万岁！
