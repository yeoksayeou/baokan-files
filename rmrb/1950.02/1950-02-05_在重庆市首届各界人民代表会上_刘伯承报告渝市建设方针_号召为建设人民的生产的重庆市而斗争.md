Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, 3rd. Liu Bocheng, Chairman of the Southwest Military and Political Committee, delivered a report entitled "Struggle to Build a People's and Productive Chongqing" at the first Chongqing Municipal People's Congress on January 23. Excerpts are as follows:

It has been one month and twenty-three days since Chongqing's liberation. Thanks to the assistance of people from all walks of life in Chongqing in helping the Chongqing Military Control Commission to take over and establish a revolutionary order, all work is transitioning from reception to management. The purpose of convening the first session of the People's Congress is to analyze our environment and discuss how to build a people's, productive Chongqing.

Chongqing is the political, economic, transportation, and cultural center of the Southwest region, with a population of 1.2 million. Under the long rule of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism, Chongqing was once an important base for Chiang Kai-shek's bandit gang to launch a treasonous civil war, and many feudal and fascist poisons were spread and cultivated materially and spiritually. Before liberation, it suffered from the arson, explosions, and massacres of the Kuomintang bandit gang. Although Chongqing has been liberated, the remaining forces of imperialism and Chiang Kai-shek's bandits on Chinese territory have not been completely eliminated, and Taiwan, Tibet, and Hainan Island are yet to be liberated. The enemy is transforming from open struggle with armed groups to scattered, concealed struggle. Secret agents and bandits in urban and rural areas are still disrupting revolutionary order and production and construction. The large number of civil servants abandoned by Chiang Kai-shek's bandit gang, the hundreds of thousands of Kuomintang troops who revolted, surrendered, and were captured, must be reformed, reorganized, and resettled. Dispersed soldiers and vagrants must be accommodated, trained, and dealt with. Moreover, there are many difficulties to overcome in changing the economic structure from reactionary rule to a new democratic economic structure, and there are many obstacles to eliminate in urban-rural mutual assistance and internal and external exchanges. These are the difficulties we are encountering. However, with the leadership of the Central People's Government headed by Chairman Mao, the common efforts of all the people, the abundant resources of the Southwest, and the assistance of the Soviet Union, other people's democratic countries, and other countries, these difficulties can be overcome.

Current Specific Tasks: Support the War, Conduct Economic Construction, Eliminate Urban and Rural Bandits and Secret Agents, Protect Security, Assist Rural Reform, and Develop Agriculture

Based on the above analysis, our policy is: to support the soon-to-be-completed Liberation War with a gradually recovering people's Chongqing, to assist rural reform, to develop agricultural production, and then, on the basis of the completion of rural land reform and agricultural development, to further develop Chongqing's production and construction, so that it can steadily prosper. Our current specific tasks are: First, to support the People's Liberation War, to recover Taiwan, Tibet, and Hainan Island, to liberate all national territory, to establish national defense, to defend the country's independence, democracy, peace, and unity, and to carry out economic construction. Second, to further establish revolutionary order and protect security. The enemy secretly deploys secret agents, spreads rumors to confuse the public, carries out sabotage, and sows discord, especially focusing on inciting and organizing bandits in rural areas, attempting to carry out so-called guerrilla warfare and endangering people's livelihoods. In the future, people from all walks of life must further assist the government to thoroughly eliminate urban and rural secret agents and bandits, so that production and cultural and educational construction can be carried out with assurance. Third, to face the countryside and face the whole country to restore production. Facing the countryside means helping to develop agricultural production, which is to implement urban-rural mutual assistance in production. Facing the whole country means making production adapt to the certain needs of the whole country, and formulating plans for the restoration of production in public and private factories based on sales conditions, so as to avoid blind production. In order to restore and develop production, it is necessary to: rectify traffic and dock order, develop trade; appropriately resolve labor-capital issues, and use both parties' consultation and the method of signing contracts to achieve mutual benefit for labor and capital; consult on public-private relations, implement specific cooperation in raw material procurement, manufacturing costs, and finished product sales, and encourage private enterprises to develop in undertakings beneficial to the national economy and people's livelihood under the leadership of state-owned enterprises, so that capitalists can eliminate unnecessary concerns; recruit, unite, and transform old personnel in the restoration of production, and lead them to maintain their livelihoods and overcome difficulties by the method of "the food of three people is divided among five people," while reasonably adjusting organizational structures and saving costs. Fourth, to carry out cultural and educational undertakings around the basic task of restoring and developing production; to focus on improving the political consciousness and cultural level of the masses of the people, to eliminate feudal, comprador, and fascist ideas, and to promote the idea of serving the people. Chongqing's cultural and educational institutions should formulate implementation plans based on their own conditions. All schools must also pay attention to helping workers and staff in nearby production departments with their spare-time studies after class. In addition, Chongqing is densely populated and the municipal administration is in disrepair. For example, the sewers are blocked and stagnant water accumulates, which may cause epidemics. This requires us to urgently organize. Appropriate facilities must also be made in health and medical undertakings.

　　在重庆市首届各界人民代表会上
    刘伯承报告渝市建设方针
    号召为建设人民的生产的重庆市而斗争
    【新华社重庆三日电】西南军政委员会主席刘伯承一月二十三日在重庆市第一届各界人民代表会议上发表题为《为建设人民的、生产的重庆而斗争》的报告，摘要如下：
    重庆解放迄今一个月又二十三天，由于各界人民从各方面帮助重庆市军管会进行接管工作和建立革命秩序，一切工作正由接收转入到管理的时期。召开第一届各界人民代表会议的目的，就是为了分析我们所处的环境，讨论如何建立人民的、生产的重庆。
    重庆是西南区政治、经济、交通、文化的中心，居民有一百二十万人口。在帝国主义、封建主义和官僚资本主义较久的统治下，重庆曾经成为蒋匪介石发动卖国内战的重要基地，物质上和精神上都被散布和培植了许多封建、法西斯的毒素；解放前，又遭受了国民党匪帮焚烧、爆炸和屠杀。现在重庆虽已解放，但帝国主义和蒋匪介石在中国领土上的残余力量还未肃清，台湾、西藏、海南岛尚待解放。敌人正从集团武装的公开斗争，转为分散的隐蔽的斗争。城乡的特务、土匪还在破坏革命秩序和生产建设。蒋匪介石遗弃的大批公务员，起义、投诚和被俘的几十万国民党军队，必须改造、改编及安置。散兵游勇必须收容、集训和处理。并且，由反动统治的经济结构改变为新民主主义的经济结构，有许多困难尚待克服，城乡互助和内外交流也有许多障碍尚须消除。这些都是我们所遭遇到的困难。但是，有以毛主席为首的中央人民政府的领导，有全体人民的共同努力，有西南的丰富资源，加上苏联和各人民民主国家及其他各国人民的援助，这些困难都是可以克服的。
  目前的具体任务  支援战争进行经济建设  消灭城乡匪特保卫治
        安  协助农村改革发展农业
    根据上面的分析，我们的方针是：以渐次康复的人民的重庆，来支援即将完成的解放战争，协助农村改革，发展农业生产，然后在农村土地改革完成和农业发展的基础上进一步发展重庆市的生产建设，使之稳步地繁荣起来。我们目前的具体任务是：第一，支援人民解放战争，收复台湾、西藏、海南岛，以解放全国领土、建立国防，保卫国家的独立、民主、和平、统一，进行经济建设。第二，进一步建立革命秩序和保卫治安。敌人秘密布置特务，造谣惑众，进行破坏并挑拨离间，尤其着重在农村煽动和组织土匪，妄图进行所谓游击战争，危害人民生计。今后各界人民须进一步协助政府，彻底消灭城乡的特务和土匪，使生产、文化教育建设能有保障地进行。第三，面向农村、面向全国来恢复生产。面向农村就是帮助发展农业生产，就是在生产上实行城乡互助。面向全国就是使生产适应全国的一定的需要，根据销路情形来制定公私工厂恢复生产的计划，以免盲目生产。为着恢复和发展生产，必须：整顿交通和码头秩序，发展贸易：适当地解决劳资问题，用双方协商和订定合同的办法，以实现劳资两利；协商公私关系，在原料收购、制造成本、成品推销上实行具体合作，鼓励私营企业在国营企业的领导之下向有益于国计民生的事业发展，使资本家消除不必要的顾虑；在恢复生产中录用、团结与改造旧人员，领导他们以“三个人的饭，匀作五个人来吃”的办法维持生活，渡过困难，同时合理调整组织机构和节约成本。第四，围绕着恢复和发展生产的基本任务来开展文化教育事业；着重提高人民大众的政治觉悟和文化水平，肃清封建的、买办的、法西斯主义的思想，发扬为人民服务的思想。重庆文化、教育机关应据此按自己的条件订出实施的计划。各学校并须注意在课余帮助附近生产部门的工人、职员的业余学习。此外，重庆人烟稠密，市政失修，例如下水道不通，积水淤塞，可能引起时疫。这要我们急切整理。在卫生、医药事业上亦须作适当的设施。
