　　Beijing Retail Company Operates for a Month
    Supplies Citizens with Necessities in Large Quantities
    [Beijing News] The Retail Company under the Beijing Municipal People's Government Commercial Bureau, since its official establishment in January of this year, has widely set up retail stores for grain, cloth, coal, salt, etc., directly supplying the working people of Beijing. It has played a certain role in stabilizing prices and ensuring people's livelihoods. As of the end of January, there were a total of 136 grain retail stores, 30 cotton cloth retail stores, and 253 coal briquette retail stores; in January, a total of over 6,758,300 jin of grain, over 30,000 zhang of cotton cloth, 2,814 tons of coal briquettes, and over 31,000 jin of salt were sold. However, due to some shortcomings in management, such as the relatively small allocation of grain types, there have been instances of insufficient supply of millet flour, corn flour, oat flour, and buckwheat flour needed by citizens; also, the quality of edible salt is poor and the price is high, resulting in low sales volume. The unfriendly attitude of individual staff members has also caused dissatisfaction among the masses. The Retail Company has begun to pay attention to correcting these problems.

Workers and their families in state-owned and private factories, but workers in private factories who are provided with meals by the capitalists are only provided for their families and not for themselves; 2.

　　京零售公司经营一月
    大量供应市民必需品
    【北京讯】北京市人民政府商业局所属零售公司自本年一月正式成立后，普设粮、布、煤、盐等零售店，直接供应京市劳动人民，对稳定物价，保障人民生活上起了一定作用。截至一月底止已共有粮食零售店一百三十六户，棉布零售店三十户，煤球零售铺二百五十三户；一月份共售出粮食六百七十五万八千三百余斤，棉布三万余丈，煤球二千八百十四吨，盐三万一千多斤。但由于经营方面，仍有一些缺点，如调拨的粮种较少，致使市民所需的小米面、玉米面、莜面、荞面等曾发生供应不足的现象；又如食盐质量次，价格高，以致销售量不大。个别工作人员态度不和蔼，也曾引起群众不满。零售公司对这些问题已开始注意纠正。
