　　Beijing Securities Exchange Trial Opening Yesterday, Pre-Market Trading Good and Normal
    [Beijing News] The Beijing Securities Exchange began trading yesterday (the 1st). Fearing that brokers and exchange staff might not be technically proficient enough, only the pre-market (morning) was open for trial yesterday. The situation was good, and trading was normal. It was decided to open both the pre- and post-markets from today. Yesterday, Qixin opened at 185,500 yuan, with a high of 185,500 yuan, a low of 179,000 yuan, and a closing price of 179,000 yuan. Jiangnan opened at 44,000 yuan, with a high of 44,000 yuan, a low of 43,000 yuan, and a closing price of 43,000 yuan. Luan Mine opened at 46,000 yuan and closed at 45,000 yuan. Dongya opened at 84,000 yuan and closed at 84,000 yuan. Renli opened at 25,000 yuan and closed at 25,000 yuan. Yaohua opened at 18,000 yuan and closed at 18,000 yuan. Brokers generally expressed satisfaction with yesterday's trial opening of the pre-market. They estimate that there is a considerable amount of idle capital in Beijing, but at present, citizens are not very accustomed to investing through securities. They hope that the government will investigate companies that have already listed their stocks and those that are preparing to list their stocks, so that the general public can understand the company's business operations and financial status, in order to facilitate selection. At the same time, it can also promote the company to improve some non-enterprise shortcomings. Brokers believe that they also have an obligation to assist the government in conducting investigations to realize the government's task for the new securities exchange.

　　京证券交易所昨试开前市
    情形良好交易正常
    【北京讯】北京市证券交易所昨（一）日起开始交易，因恐经纪人和所方工作人员在技术上还不够熟练，昨日只试开前市（上午），经过情形良好，交易正常，决定自今日起开前后两市。昨日启新开盘一八五、五○○元，最高一八五、五○○元，最低一七九、○○○元，收盘一七九、○○○元；江南开盘四四、○○○元，最高四四、○○○元，最低四三、○○○元，收盘四三、○○○元；滦矿开盘四六、○○○元，收盘四五、○○○元；东亚开盘八四、○○○元，收盘八四、○○○元；仁立开盘二五、○○○元，收盘二五、○○○元；耀华开盘一八、○○○元，收盘一八、○○○元。经纪人一般的对昨日试开前市情形表示满意，他们估计北京市的游资确有相当数目，但目前市民对通过证券这一方式进行投资还不大习惯，希望政府对已有股票上市的公司及准备把股票上市的公司进行调查，使一般市民能明了该公司的营业情形，财产状况，以便于选择；同时也可以促进该公司改进一些非企业化的缺点，经纪人认为也有义务协助政府进行调查，来实现政府对新的证券交易所的任务。
