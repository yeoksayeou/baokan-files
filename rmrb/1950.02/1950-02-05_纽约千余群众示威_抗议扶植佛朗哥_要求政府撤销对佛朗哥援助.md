Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, February 4th: According to a France Press Washington dispatch: U.S. Secretary of State Acheson issued a statement on January 18th indicating that the United States is prepared to support a proposal in the United Nations to restore full diplomatic relations with the Spanish Franco regime, and acknowledged that the United States has suggested to the Franco government that a treaty of friendship, trade, and navigation be concluded. Acheson's statement clarified the U.S. government's policy towards Franco. Since last autumn, numerous U.S. officials, including many Congressmen who have frequently visited Spain, as well as Joint Chief of Staff Bradley, Senate Democratic leader Connally, and Senate Republican foreign policy leader Vandenberg, have constantly clamored for the establishment of formal diplomatic relations with Franco.

This policy of the U.S. government has aroused strong protests among the American people. According to TASS: The American Joint Anti-Fascist Refugee Committee held a demonstration rally of 1,500 people in New York on January 28th to launch a movement to force the U.S. government to abandon the above-mentioned shameless conspiracy. U.S. Labor Party Congressman Marcantonio, former Attorney General Rogge, and Chairman of the Joint Anti-Fascist Refugee Committee Balesky all delivered speeches at the meeting. The conference unanimously passed a resolution, sending a telegram to Truman and Acheson, protesting the U.S. government's policy of "re-Nazifying West Germany and maintaining the fascist dictatorship in Spain." The conference demanded the immediate revocation of all military, economic, and diplomatic aid given to Franco. The conference condemned "the plan to restore formal diplomatic relations with the fascist Franco government and to provide economic and military support to this bankrupt remnant of the Axis powers" as an act leading to war, and pointed out: "This practice of saving Franco from being overthrown by the Spanish people will violate our oath to the millions of people who sacrificed themselves in the war to eliminate fascism; to the Spanish people, this is a betrayal of the Spanish people's persistent struggle for democracy."

　　纽约千余群众示威  抗议扶植佛朗哥
    要求政府撤销对佛朗哥援助
    【新华社北京四日电】据法新社华盛顿消息：美国国务卿艾奇逊于一月十八日发表声明，表示美国准备在联合国中支持与西班牙佛朗哥政权恢复充分外交关系的提案，并承认美国已向佛朗哥政府建议缔结友好、贸易及航运条约。艾奇逊的这一表示，使美国政府对佛朗哥的政策明朗化。自去秋以来，美国许多官方人物包括频频访问西班牙的许多国会议员、以及联合参谋长布莱德雷、参院民主党首脑康纳利、参院共和党外交政策首脑范登堡等，即曾不断发出要求与佛朗哥建立正式外交关系的叫嚣。
    美国政府的这种政策，在美国人民中激起了强烈的抗议。据塔斯社报道：美国反法西斯流亡者联合委员会特于一月二十八日在纽约举行一千五百人的示威大会，以发动强迫美国政府放弃上述无耻阴谋的运动。美国劳工党众议员马肯托尼奥，前司法部长罗奇及反法西斯流亡者联合委员会主席巴尔斯基等，均在会上发表演说。大会一致通过决议，致电杜鲁门与艾奇逊，抗议美国政府所奉行的“使西德重新纳粹化及维护西班牙的法西斯独裁政权”的政策。大会要求立即撤销给予佛朗哥的一切军事经济与外交援助。大会斥责“与法西斯的佛朗哥政府恢复正式外交关系和对这一个破产了的轴心集团的余孽予以经济与军事支持的计划”，是导向战争的行动；并指出：“这种挽救佛朗哥免被西班牙人民推翻的做法，将违背我们对千百万在消灭法西斯主义的战争中牺牲的人民所作的誓言；对西班牙人民来说，这就是出卖西班牙人民争取民主的坚持不渝的斗争。”
