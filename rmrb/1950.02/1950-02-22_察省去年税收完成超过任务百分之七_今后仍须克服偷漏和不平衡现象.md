[Reported by this Newspaper] Chahar Province successfully completed its tax collection task last year, exceeding the original target set by the North China People's Government by a strong 6.9 percent. The tax revenue completion status of the province's five special districts and municipal tax bureaus is as follows: Datong Municipal Bureau exceeded its original allocated task by 13.7 percent; Zhangjiakou Municipal Bureau exceeded by 17 percent; Chahan South Special District exceeded by 8.4 percent. Only Chahan North and Yanbei performed relatively poorly, with Chahan North Special District failing to complete 7.3 percent of its task; Yanbei Special District still had 12.1 percent unfulfilled.

During this tax collection work in Chahar Province, many cities and counties implemented the mass line and adopted the methods of "self-reporting, public discussion, and typical investigation" for industrial and commercial taxes. Experience has proven that "self-reporting, public discussion" and "typical investigation" are two important links in tax collection work and should not be neglected. However, the central link that leadership should grasp is typical cases. Without understanding typical cases, it is impossible to deeply understand the situation, and it is also impossible to actively lead during democratic public discussion and collection. For example, after Zhangjiakou accepted this lesson, it conducted investigations of typical households, selecting upper, middle, and lower-class households that could represent general industrial and commercial businesses. In addition to turnover, consumption, and profits, the content of the investigation also included understanding past burden levels as a measure for evaluation and discussion. In addition, Zhangjiakou discovered many false accounts and tax evasion schemes during the typical account checking work, laying the foundation for plugging tax loopholes in the future. Secondly, preparation work must be done well before carrying out evaluation work, such as selecting evaluators from various industries, soliciting opinions from various parties, and preparing reference materials. Public discussions should be conducted separately by industry first, and then repeatedly discussed centrally to ensure reasonable public discussion.

Secondly, cities and counties should strengthen their leadership in tax collection work. Many mayors and county heads in Chahar Province served as directors of the collection committee and personally explained the government's tax policies at industrial and commercial conferences. Many counties discussed specific tax issues at people's representative conferences at all levels. Due to the attention of the leadership, the allocation of cadres has also been strengthened compared to the past. Last year, the province trained and promoted more than 600 new cadres, which significantly improved the work. Thirdly, the focus of leadership in tax collection work should first be placed on major regions, major taxes, and major industries. Only by grasping the key points can the task be better completed. For example, Yuxian County's tax revenue ranks first in the entire Chahan South region. After the Chahan South Special District moved to Xuanhua Town, it once relaxed its leadership, resulting in a large backlog of debts in the county. Later, after conducting key inspections and strengthening leadership, it was quickly completed in full. Cities and counties should also focus on grasping several major tax revenue industries. Fourth, it is necessary to emphasize inspection, collection, and management work. For example, when Zhangjiakou inspected stamp duty, it found that tax evasion was quite serious and varied. After in-depth inspection and management, tax evasion was greatly reduced, and the sale of stamp duty tickets greatly increased.

However, due to insufficient experience in urban tax collection in Chahar Province, especially the lack of sufficient understanding of the importance of urban tax revenue, and the lack of accurate investigation and statistics on urban tax sources, there was a great deal of blindness; this resulted in an imbalance in the burden between regions, between industries, and between large and small merchants during the collection process. Moreover, the collection of most tax laws was low. Concealment and tax evasion among merchants are still very serious, affecting the normal income of the state. For example, Zhangjiakou City failed to levy various taxes in a timely manner in January at the beginning of liberation, and even the main municipal tax was not levied. In the first half of last year, Xuanhua Town had an overly broad tax exemption for vendors, reaching a staggering 77 percent. Due to the imperfect tax structure in Chahan North, many villages still brew alcohol privately, which has not yet been banned, affecting the country's alcohol monopoly. It is estimated that these tax evasion losses amount to at least 40,000 shi of millet.

### 察省去年税收完成超过任务百分之七  今后仍须克服偷漏和不平衡现象

　　察省去年税收完成超过任务百分之七
    今后仍须克服偷漏和不平衡现象
    【本报讯】察哈尔省去年全省税收已胜利完成，并超过原华北人民政府所规定任务的百分之六点九强。该省五个专、市税务局完成税收任务情况：大同市局超过原分配任务的百分之十三点七；张家口市局超过百分之十七；察南专局超过百分之八点四。只有察北雁北较差，察北专局有百分之七点三尚未完成；雁北专局尚有百分之十二点一未完成。
    察省此次征收工作，不少市、县都贯彻了群众路线，对工商业税采取了“自报公议、典型调查”的方法。经验证明，“自报公议”与“典型调查”均是税收工作中两个重要环节，不可偏废。但在领导方面所要掌握的中心环节是典型材料。因为不掌握典型材料，就不能深入了解情况，在民主公议与征收时也无法主动的加以领导。如张市在接受了这一经验教训，即进行典型户调查，选择能够代表一般工商业者的上、中、下三等户口。调查内容除营业额、消耗、利润外，并结合了解以往负担量，以作为测量评议的尺度。另外，张市在典型查账工作中，并查出了很多假账与偷税的花样，给今后堵塞漏税打下基础。其次在进行评议工作前一定要搞好准备工作，如选好各行业评议员，多方吸取意见，搞好参考材料等。公议时应先由各行业分别进行，然后再集中反复讨论，务使公议合理。
    其次，各市、县应加强对税收工作的领导。察省很多市长县长都担任了征收委员会的主任，亲自到工商界会议上解释政府的税收政策。很多县在各界人民代表会议上讨论了税收的具体问题。由于领导的注意，干部配备也较过去加强，去年全省共培养提拔新干部六百余人，使工作获得显著的进步。第三，税收工作的领导重点，应首先放在主要地区、主要税收、主要行业上面，只有抓住重点才能较好地完成任务。如蔚县税源占察南全区第一位。自察南专局移至宣化镇后，曾一度放松领导，致该县尾欠很大。后来进行重点检查，加强领导后，很快就扫数完成。各市、县，也应有重点地抓住几个主要税源行业。第四，要强调稽征与管理工作，如张市在检查印花税时，发现偷税现象相当严重，花样繁多，后经深入检查、管理的结果，使偷税现象大为减少，售出印花税票大增。
    但是察省征收工作，由于对城市税收经验不足，特别是对城市税收的重要性没有足够的认识，对城市税源没有精确调查统计，因而盲目性限大；致造成征收中若干地区与地区间、行业与行业间、大商户与小商户间负担不平衡现象。而且大部税律征收均低。商人中的隐瞒偷漏现象仍很严重，影响了国家的正常收入。例如张家口市在解放初的一月份就未及时开征各种税收，连主要市税亦未开征。宣化镇在去年前半年对摊贩的免税面过宽，竟达百分之七十七强。察北由于税务机构不健全，不少村庄私自酿酒至今仍未取缔，影响国家的酒业专卖，这几项漏税，据估计损失小米至少达四万余市石。
