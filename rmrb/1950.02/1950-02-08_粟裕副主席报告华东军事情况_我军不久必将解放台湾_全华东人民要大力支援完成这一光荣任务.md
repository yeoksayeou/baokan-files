Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 7th. The full text of the report by Su Yu, Vice Chairman of the East China Military and Political Committee, on the military situation in East China at the first meeting of the East China Military and Political Committee is as follows:

    The Chinese People's War of Liberation has achieved a fundamental victory. Now, except for remote Tibet, the Kuomintang bandit regular army has been completely eliminated on the Chinese mainland; and even the bandit and special agent armed forces dispatched and created by the Kuomintang bandits, scattered in various places, have been mostly wiped out, or are being wiped out. Now, only the islands along the southeast coast and Taiwan are still occupied by the Chiang Kai-shek bandit army. Therefore, liberating the islands along the southeast coast and Taiwan, liberating all the territory and territorial waters of the Chinese people, and finally and thoroughly eliminating the remnants of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, are precisely the urgent and major tasks of our East China people and the East China People's Liberation Army.

    Liberating Taiwan is a Major Issue - Sufficient Material and Technical Preparation is Needed
    First of all, I should explain that liberating the islands along the southeast coast, especially liberating Taiwan, is an extremely important issue, the largest modern battle in Chinese war history. Without sufficient seagoing vessels and appropriately superior equipment, as well as adequate material supplies, it would be difficult to capture. Moreover, a considerable number of Chiang Kai-shek's bandit land, sea, and air forces are concentrated there, as well as a large group of the most stubborn reactionary elements who fled from the Chinese mainland. Relying on the surrounding seas, they have built strong resistance fortifications. At the same time, under the instigation and with the assistance of American imperialism, they have hired a large number of Japanese warlords who have slaughtered countless Chinese people to defend Taiwan for them and to fly planes to continue slaughtering the Chinese people. We must not ignore these real problems. We must recognize that these are new difficulties in our current operations. Only by fully preparing the material and technical conditions to overcome these difficulties can we more victoriously complete this great combat mission and thoroughly eliminate these remaining bandits.

    Difficulties Cannot Stop the Great March - We Have Many Favorable Conditions
    However, we must not draw the wrong conclusion that we cannot liberate Taiwan and other places because of these difficulties. On the contrary, we have many favorable conditions for liberating the islands along the southeast coast and Taiwan. Although the Chiang Kai-shek bandit army has concentrated about 230,000 regular troops (plus special forces and local troops, a total of about 300,000), they are distributed in Taiwan and the southeastern islands, and their forces are still extremely weak. Furthermore, these troops have the designations of 15 armies and 44 divisions, accounting for 71 percent of the 61 divisions and 340,000 men of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit remnants, and most of them are remnants and defeated soldiers who fled from the mainland, with a chaotic structure, many officers and few soldiers, or so-called "new troops" that have not yet experienced combat. Here people will recall the situation at the beginning of the Liberation War in 1946. At that time, the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang had more than 3 million troops, hundreds of tanks, tens of thousands of artillery pieces, and thousands of aircraft, as well as more than a million people with American-equipped weapons who had been personally trained and commanded by generals of American imperialism in more than forty armies. Moreover, at that time, the bandit gangs occupied vast areas of the Chinese mainland, possessed a large amount of manpower and material resources, and controlled all major cities, transportation centers, and strategic points. However, at that time, the People's Liberation Army was only three to four hundred thousand field troops just assembled from guerrillas in various places, with very poor guns, no tanks, no aircraft, very few artillery pieces, and a shortage of ammunition, and there was no time for strict training. But in less than three years, we turned from defense to offense, from weak to strong, and have achieved advantages in strategy, tactics, materials and technology. We eliminated all the main forces of the Chiang Kai-shek bandits and cleared the Chiang Kai-shek regular army on the mainland. Taking only the East China region as an example: at the beginning of the Liberation War in 1946, the Chiang Kai-shek bandit regular army used in the East China battlefield had 21 armies and 57 divisions, 493,000 people. At that time, the field army in our East China battlefield was only about 70,000 people. After the Chiang Kai-shek bandits launched a key offensive in Shandong in 1947, the regular army they used in the Shandong battlefield increased to 30 armies, 74 divisions, and 545,000 people. If we add the Chiang Kai-shek troops in Subei, Subei, Huainan, and Huaibei, there would be 700,000 to 800,000. At that time, the field army of our East China People's Liberation Army was only over 100,000 people. Under the wise leadership of Chairman Mao and the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, with the cooperation of various strategic regions and field armies across the country, under the correct leadership of the East China Bureau of the Communist Party of China, and with the full support of the people of East China, we not only crushed the key offensive of the Chiang Kai-shek army, but also turned from defense to offense, completely recovered the areas occupied by the Chiang Kai-shek bandits, liberated the vast new areas and cities in the southeast half, and completely eliminated the Chiang Kai-shek regular army on the mainland in the East China region. In the past three years of the Liberation War, our East China Field Army and local troops have killed and wounded a total of 757,512 Chiang Kai-shek bandit troops, captured 1,246,362 Chiang Kai-shek bandit troops, 65,157 Chiang Kai-shek troops were forced to surrender, and 40,811 revolted, totaling 2,100,9742 Chiang Kai-shek bandit troops lost. In terms of seizures, taking only artillery of various calibers as an example, there were 21,298 pieces, which is dozens of times more than at the beginning of the war. Now most of our army has been replaced with American-equipped weapons. In addition, in the past six months, we have eliminated a total of 64,778 bandit and special agent armed forces dispatched and created by the Chiang Kai-shek bandits, basically clearing or being cleared of bandit forces.

    The People of Taiwan Will Strengthen Their Struggle - It Will Play a Big Role at the Appropriate Time
    Our East China Field Army and local troops were originally a small number of troops, but thanks to the wise leadership of Chairman Mao and the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, and the full support of the broad masses of the people, especially the broad masses of the people in the old liberated areas who tightened their belts and actively mobilized their fathers, brothers, and children to join the army and support the front line, we were able to achieve such a great victory. Now the Chiang Kai-shek regular army on the mainland has been eliminated, and the bandit army trapped on the islands along the southeast coast and Taiwan is only the remnant of the remnants. At the same time, under the severe oppression and exploitation of the Chiang Kai-shek bandits colluding with American imperialism and Japanese warlords, the people of Taiwan will give full play to their fighting spirit of the "February 28th" uprising and strengthen their resistance to the Chiang Kai-shek bandit army. Their struggle will play an immeasurable role at the appropriate time. At the same time, the Chiang Kai-shek bandit army will also further disintegrate. These are all favorable conditions for us to liberate the islands along the southeast coast and Taiwan. As long as we deeply understand the realistic problems mentioned above and fully prepare the material basis and technical conditions to overcome difficulties, then we are fully confident that we will liberate the islands along the southeast coast and Taiwan in the near future and thoroughly eliminate those bandit remnants.

    In Order to Achieve Long-Term Peace, the People Must Fully Support This Operation
    The campaign to liberate the islands along the southeast coast and Taiwan is the task of the East China Liberation Army and also the task of all the people of East China. This combat mission is extremely arduous and is a modern-style operation. The victory or defeat of modern warfare, in addition to political conditions, is also the final competition of manpower, material resources, financial resources, and military strength. Whoever has the advantage in manpower, material resources, financial resources, and military strength will be able to achieve victory. Therefore, we need to pay a huge amount of manpower and material consumption. In the past, when we fought on the mainland, throwing a grenade required consuming 30 catties of rice; firing a mortar shell required consuming 180 catties of rice; and firing a rifle bullet also required consuming 10 catties of rice. Now, crossing the sea to fight is a completely new problem, a modern-style operation, which requires a large supply of manpower, material resources, financial resources, and weapons, as well as excellent technical guidance. In order to thoroughly eliminate the remaining bandits, to reduce the losses of the people, to liberate all the territory and territorial waters, to guarantee the victory already achieved by the revolution, and to enable our country to quickly transition to peaceful construction, we must pay this indispensable huge war expense, otherwise the people, especially the people of East China, will not be able to achieve long-term peace.

    East China is located on the front line of southeast national defense, with its coastline accounting for 67% of the country's total. In order to consolidate national defense and shoulder this combat mission, it is also extremely glorious. In order to quickly complete this glorious and great task, I ask the East China Military and Political Committee and the people of all strata in East China to support the Liberation Army with abundant manpower and full material and technical resources in accordance with the principle of reasonable burden. I believe that all members, gentlemen, comrades, and the broad masses of people of all strata will definitely give full support to the Liberation Army like the farmers in the old liberated areas did in the past. Although the total living expenses of each commander and fighter of our People's Liberation Army are only 1,550 catties of rice per year, for the long-term interests of the country and the people, we should continue to endure hardship, overcome difficulties, and strive to strengthen training and combat readiness. As long as the people can provide us with sufficient combat materials and good technical equipment, under the wise leadership of Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu, we can also guarantee that the East China People's Liberation Army will definitely be able to complete the huge task of liberating the islands along the southeast coast and Taiwan in the near future, in order to cooperate with the fraternal field armies across the country to complete the glorious task of liberating all of China.

　　粟裕副主席报告华东军事情况
    我军不久必将解放台湾
    全华东人民要大力支援完成这一光荣任务
    【新华社上海七日电】华东军政委员会粟裕副主席，在华东军政委员会第一次会议上关于华东军事情况的报告全文如下：
    中国人民解放战争，已经取得了基本上的胜利。现在中国大陆上除了边远的西藏而外，已经完全消灭了蒋匪正规军；而且连蒋匪所派遣与制造出来的，分散在各地的土匪特务武装，也已大部被我们肃清，或正在肃清着。现在仅剩下东南沿海诸岛和台湾，尚为蒋家匪军所盘据。因此，解放东南沿海诸岛和台湾，解放中国人民的全部领土与领海，最后彻底消灭蒋匪帮的残余，也正就是我们华东人民和华东人民解放军当前迫切的重大任务。
    解放台湾是个重大问题  要充分准备物质与技术
    首先我应说明的，解放东南沿海诸岛，特别是解放台湾，是一个极其重大的问题，是中国战史上从来没有的一个最大的近代化作战的战役，如果没有足够的渡海的船只和适当优越的装备，以及充分的物质供应，那是很难攻占的。而且那儿集中了相当数量的蒋家匪帮陆海空军，也集中了从中国大陆上逃去的最顽固的一大群反动家伙。他们凭借着四面大海，构筑了强固的抵抗工事。同时，他们在美帝国主义的指使与援助下，更聘请了大批曾经屠杀我们中国不知多少人民的日本军阀，替他们来防守台湾，替他们来驾驶飞机，继续来屠杀中国人民。这一些现实问题，我们决不可忽视。必须认识到，这是我们当前作战中新的困难，只有我们充分地准备了克服这些困难的物质与技术条件，才能更胜利地完成这一伟大的作战任务，彻底消灭这些残匪。
    困难阻止不了伟大进军  我们有着许多有利条件
    但是，我们决不能因为有这些困难而得出一个不能解放台湾等地的错误的结论；反之，我们有着解放东南沿海诸岛及台湾的许多有利条件。因为蒋匪军虽然集中了正规军约二十三万（加上特种兵及地方军共约三十万人），但分布于台湾及东南海诸岛，兵力仍极为薄弱；并且这一些军队就有十五个军四十四个师的番号，占了蒋匪残存总兵力六十一个师三十四万人中的百分之七十一，而其中多半又是从大陆上逃跑去的残兵败将，建制混乱，官多兵少，或者是还没有经过战斗的所谓“新军”。在此人们会回忆到一九四六年解放战争初期时的情况，当时蒋家匪帮有三百多万大军，有几百辆坦克，几万门大炮，有上千架飞机，有经美帝国主义的将军们亲自训练出来与亲自指挥着的四十几个军的百余万人的美械化装备；而且当时匪帮们还盘据着中国大陆上的广大地区，占有着众多的人力物力，控制着一切大城市和交通中心，及战略要点。可是那时候全国的人民解放军还不过是刚从各地游击队组合起来的、枪支很坏的三四十万野战军，既没有坦克，更没有飞机，大炮也很少，弹药更缺乏，也来不及严格训练。但仅仅经过了不到三年，我们即转守为攻，转弱为强，而且在战略战术上、物质与技术上都已经取得了优势。我们消灭了蒋匪的一切主力，肃清了大陆上的蒋匪正规军。我们单从华东范围来说：在一九四六年解放战争开始时，蒋匪使用在华东战场的正规军有二十一个军五十七个师，四十九万三千人，当时，我们华东战场的野战军不过七万人左右。在一九四七年蒋匪发动重点进攻山东后，其使用在山东战场的正规军，即增至三十个军七十四个师，五十四万五千人，如果加上苏中、苏北、淮南、准北的蒋军，则有七、八十万之多。当时我们华东人民解放军的野战军，也不过十几万人。在毛主席及中共中央英明领导下，在全国各战略区和野战军配合下，在中共华东局的正确领导下，在华东人民的全力支援下，我们不仅粉碎了蒋匪军的重点进攻，我们也由防御转为进攻，完全收复了被蒋匪侵占的地区，解放了东南半壁的广大新区和城市，完全消灭了华东区大陆上的蒋匪正规军。在这三年来的解放战争中，我们华东野战军及地方军，总共毙伤蒋匪军七十五万七千五百十二名，俘掳蒋匪军一百二十四万六千三百六十二名，蒋军被迫投诚者有六万五千一百五十七名，起义者四万零八百十一名，合计蒋匪军损失二百一十万零九千七百四十二名。在缴获方面，仅以各种口径炮来说，即有二万一千二百九十八门，比起战争初期增加了几十倍。现在我们全军绝大部分换成了美械装备。此外我们并在最近半年中，消灭了蒋匪所派遣和制造出来的土匪特务武装共六万四千七百七十八名，基本上肃清了或正在肃清着股匪。
    台湾人民必将加强斗争  适当时期会起很大作用
    我们华东野战军与地方军，本来是一支数量不大的军队，但由于毛主席及中共中央的英明领导，和广大人民的全力支援，特别是老解放区广大人民节衣缩食，并动员他们的父兄子弟踊跃参军与支援前线，就能够取得这样大的胜利。现在大陆上的蒋匪正规军已经肃清，而困守东南沿海诸岛及台湾的匪军已经只是残余的残余了。同时，台湾人民在蒋匪勾结美帝国主义和日本军阀的严重的压迫与榨取下，将会发挥起他们“二·二八”起义的斗争精神，将会加强他们对蒋匪军的反抗，他们的斗争在适当时期，将会起着不可计量的作用。同时，蒋匪军的内部也将更加分崩离析。这些都是我们解放东南沿海诸岛及台湾的有利条件。只要我们深刻认识到上面所讲的现实问题，充分地准备克服困难的物质基础与技术条件，那末我们完全有把握在不久的将来解放东南沿海诸岛及台湾，彻底地消灭那些匪帮的残余。
    人民为了长期得到安宁  必须充分支援这次作战
    解放东南沿海诸岛和台湾的战役，是华东解放军的任务，也是华东全体人民的任务。这一作战任务，是极其艰巨的，是一次近代式的作战。而近代作战的胜负，除了政治条件而外，也就是人力、物力、财力、武力的总决赛，谁在人财物武上占优势，谁就能够取得胜利。因此我们需要支付出巨大的人力与物质的消耗。过去时期我们在大陆上作战，打一个手榴弹，即需消耗三十斤大米；打一颗迫击炮弹，则需要消耗一百八十斤大米；打一颗步枪子弹，也需要消耗十斤大米；而现在渡海作战，完全是一个新的问题，是一个近代式的作战，更需要大量人力物力财力武器的供应，需要优良的技术指导。为了彻底消灭残匪，为了减少人民的损失，为了解放全部领土与领海，保障革命已得胜利，使我们全国得以迅速转入和平建设，我们就必需支付这笔不可缺少的巨大战费，否则人民，特别是华东人民，就长期地得不到安宁。
    华东是处在东南国防的最前线，海岸线几占全国百分之六十七，为了巩固国防，担负起这一作战任务，也是极其光荣的。为了迅速完成这一光荣伟大的任务，我要求华东军政委员会，要求全华东的各阶层人民，本着合理负担的原则，用众多的人力和充分的物质与技术来支援解放军。我相信各位委员、先生、同志们，和各阶层广大的人民同胞们，定能像过去老解放区农民一样，给解放军以全力支援。我们人民解放军的每个指战员，每年的全部生活费用，虽然只有一千五百五十斤大米的待遇，但我们为了国家与人民的长远利益，当继续忍苦耐劳，克服困难，并努力加强训练与作战准备。只要人民能够给我们充分的作战物资的供应与良好的技术装备，我们在毛主席、朱总司令的英明领导之下，我们也可以保证，华东人民解放军于不久的将来，一定能够完成解放东南沿海诸岛和台湾的巨大任务，以配合全国各兄弟野战军，完成解放全中国的光荣任务。
