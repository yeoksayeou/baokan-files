Title: Under the protection and assistance of the French army in Vietnam, bandit troops fleeing to Vietnam harass the southwest of Guangxi. Facts prove that the French side's repeated claims of having completely disarmed all bandit troops are complete lies.

Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, February 7th: According to news from the Vietnamese-Guangxi border, a portion of the Kuomintang bandit troops who fled into the French-occupied zone of Vietnam have recently been harassing the southwestern border area of Guangxi, relying on the French-occupied zone of Vietnam. This action of the Kuomintang bandit troops has also received some assistance from the French army. News from the Guangxi front says that in mid-January, a part of the bandit troops fleeing to Vietnam, in coordination with the French army, launched an attack on Banle in the Sile County of southwestern Guangxi, and occupied Jiute in the Sile County on the 20th. At the beginning of this month, more than 7,000 remnants of bandits fleeing to the city of Geleng in Vietnam fled back to Guangxi and occupied Shuikou Pass on the southwestern border of Guangxi at the beginning of this month. Since mid-December of last year, more than 30,000 Kuomintang bandit troops have fled from Guangxi and Yunnan into the French-occupied zone of Vietnam. French officials have repeatedly claimed that all bandit troops fleeing to Vietnam have been disarmed and detained. However, the facts discovered later are quite inconsistent with these statements. As early as December 29 last year, more than 1,000 people from the 176th Division of the bandit troops who fled to Vietnam fled back to Shuikou Pass and near Longzhou. The recent occupation of Shuikou Pass and Jiute by bandit troops fleeing to Vietnam further proves that this part of the bandit troops entering Vietnam has neither been disarmed nor detained.

　　在越南法军庇护帮助下
    逃越匪军窜扰桂西南
    事实证明，法方一再声称已将匪军全部解除武装全是撒谎。
    【新华社北京七日电】据越桂边界消息，逃入越南法占区的国民党匪军一部，最近依托越南法占区向广西的西南边境地带窜扰。国民党匪军的这种行动并得到法国军队的某种帮助。广西前线的消息说：上月中旬曾有逃越匪军一部在法军配合下向广西西南思乐县境的板乐进攻，并于二十日占领思乐县境的九特。本月初，流窜于越境格冷城的残匪七千余人又向广西回窜，并于本月初攻占广西西南边界上的水口关。按自去年十二月中旬以来，先后由广西及云南逃入越南法占区的国民党匪军已达三万余人。法国官方曾经一再声称已将逃越匪军全部解除武装，并予拘禁。但以后发现的事实与此种声言颇多不符。早在去年十二月二十九日，逃越匪军一七六师一千余人即回窜水口关和龙州附近。最近逃越匪军的攻占水口关和九特两地，进一步证明了进入越境的这一部分匪军既未被解除武装，更未被拘禁。
