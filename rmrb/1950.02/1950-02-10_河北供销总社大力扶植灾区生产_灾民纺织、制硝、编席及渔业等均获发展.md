　　Hebei Supply and Marketing Cooperative
    Vigorously Supports Production in Disaster Areas
    Weaving, Saltpeter Production, Mat Weaving, and Fisheries All Developed for Disaster Victims
    [This Newspaper’s Dispatch] Since its establishment in September of last year, the Hebei Province Supply and Marketing Cooperative has vigorously supported production in disaster areas and opened up sales channels for local products, achieving positive results and increasing membership by over one million.
    The Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative, after its establishment in September last year, emphasized a business policy oriented towards disaster areas. It first lent 15 million jin of wheat seeds to six disaster areas including Baoding, expanding the wheat planting area by more than 1.4 million mu, laying a solid foundation for shortening the spring famine this year. Secondly, it used nearly 2 million bolts of foreign yarn, 100,000 jin of ginned cotton, and over 400 jin of pigments to support the textile industry in disaster areas. In the disaster areas of Xianghe, Sanhe, and Ji County alone, more than 1,700 looms were restored, weaving more than 66,000 bolts of homespun cloth in four months, benefiting the masses equivalent to more than 800,000 jin of millet. The saltpeter industry in disaster areas has also greatly developed due to the assistance of the supply and marketing cooperatives. More than 1,500 villages under the jurisdiction of eight special districts, including Baoding and Tianjin, organized more than 46,000 saltpeter producers, producing nearly 30 million jin of crude saltpeter in four months. Other sideline occupations, such as fishing, mat weaving, straw hat braiding, and pocket making, have also been rapidly developed due to the assistance of the supply and marketing cooperatives. For example, Anxin County can produce an average of 55,000 jin of fish per day, and the profits earned are enough to support 55,000 people. Furthermore, the number of disaster victims engaged in mat weaving has increased to 23,000 with support. Currently, a total of more than 90,000 farmers in Tianjin, Baoding, Xingtai, Tangshan, and Tong County are participating in mat weaving, producing more than 650,000 jin per month.
    In terms of opening up sales channels, the Supply and Marketing Cooperative has established local product promotion offices in Zhangjiakou and Shenyang, and has also established exchange relationships for homespun cloth and reed mats with the Jilin and Shenyang Municipal Supply and Marketing Cooperatives and Grain Companies. Promotion teams have also been organized in Suiyuan, Datong, and other places. Seven warehouses have been established in Shijiazhuang, Baoding and other towns. In addition, it has established various forms of exchange, consignment sales, and agency purchase business relationships with state-owned trade departments in inland and foreign ports. This has made homespun cloth, reed mats, and crude saltpeter, which were previously stagnant in sales, major commodities in special product exports. In the past four months, more than 2.7 million bolts of homespun cloth, more than 1.5 million jin of mats, and more than 12 million jin of saltpeter have been sold. In addition to the export of materials such as pockets, straw hat braids, and Luo Di, farmers have benefited by more than 25 million jin of miscellaneous grains. It has also exchanged more than 20 million jin of grain, more than 30 million jin of coal, and a large number of necessities such as foreign yarn, waterwheels, and salt for the cooperative members. In the process of promoting local products and exchanging them for means of livelihood, cooperatives and cooperatives, and cooperatives and state-owned economic organizations have widely signed contracts, which has played a significant role in improving product quality, guaranteeing sales, and connecting urban and rural materials, and gradually overcoming the blindness and spontaneity in production.
    From the work of organizing disaster victims to produce for self-relief and opening up sales channels, the Supply and Marketing Cooperative has established cooperatives according to different seasons, different regions, and the needs of the masses, and has conducted transactions with members based on the principle of high purchase prices and low sales prices, thus further developing and consolidating the cooperatives. In the province as a whole, within four and a half months, the number of district cooperatives increased from 160 with 130,000 members to 531 district cooperatives and 1,612 village cooperatives, with the number of members surging to over 1.244 million.

　　河北供销总社
    大力扶植灾区生产
    灾民纺织、制硝、编席及渔业等均获发展
    【本报讯】河北省供销总社大力扶助灾区生产，打开土产销路，已获得成绩，增加社员百余万人。
    该省供销总社于去年九月成立后，即强调面向灾区的经营方针，首先以一千五百万斤麦种贷给保定等六个灾区，扩大了种麦面积一百四十余万亩，为缩短今年春荒打下有力基础。其次又以近二百万块洋纱、十万斤皮棉、四百余斤颜料扶助灾区的纺织业。仅香河、三河、蓟县灾区，即恢复了织布机一千七百多架，四个月织土布六万六千多匹，群众得利合八十多万斤谷子。灾区硝业由于供销社的扶助，也有很大发展。计保定、天津等八个专区所属的一千五百余村即组织了硝民四万六千多人，四个月产皮硝近三千万斤。其他如治鱼、编席、草帽辫、口袋等数十种副业，也因供销社的扶助，得到迅速发展。如安新县每天平均可产鱼五万五千斤，所得利润足可养活五万五千人。又如织席的灾民经扶植增加至二万三千人。现天津、保定、邢台、唐山、通县共有九万多农民参加编席，月产六十五万多斤。
    在打开销路方面，供销社在张家口、沈阳均设立土产推销办事处，同时与吉林、沈阳市供销总社、粮食公司建立了土布、苇席交换关系，在绥远、大同等地亦组织推销小组。在石家庄、保定等市镇共成立七个货栈。另外还与内地外埠各国营贸易部门建立不同形式的交换、代销、代购等业务关系。这样使得过去销路呆滞的土布、苇席、皮硝，都成为特产输出中的大宗物品。近四月来共推销出土布二百七十多万匹，席一百五十多万斤，硝一千二百多万斤。加上口袋、草帽辫、罗底等物资输出，农民得利达二千五百多万斤杂粮。并为社员群众换回粮食二千多万斤、煤三千多万斤，以及大批洋纱、水车、食盐等必需品。在推销土产换回生活资料中，社与社、社与国营经济机关之间广泛地订立合同，这对于提高产品质量，保障销路，沟通城乡物资都起了很大作用，并逐步地克服生产中的盲目性与自流倾向。
    从组织灾民生产自救与打开销路的工作中，供销总社根据不同季节、不同地区与群众要求进行建社，对社员以高收低售的原则进行交易，因而使合作社得到进一步的发展与巩固。全省四个半月时间内，由区社一百六十个、社员十三万人，发展至五百三十一个区社，一千六百十二个村社，社员突增至一百二十四万四千多人。
