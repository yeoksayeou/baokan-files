    In order to prevent the bandit planes from continuing to cause damage, the entire city of Shanghai is stepping up its air defense. The Municipal Military Control Commission issued an urgent notice on the night of the bombing, ordering that thick layers of sandbags be piled around the machine rooms of all factories; flammable materials in all warehouses should be strictly controlled and appropriately dispersed; ships on the Huangpu River should be dispersed immediately, and ships carrying fuel should be prohibited from approaching other ships and dock warehouses. At the same time, the Military Control Commission also requested that all government agencies take emergency measures to arrange air defense, designate persons in charge of air defense and fire prevention, equip fire-fighting equipment, organize fire-fighting teams, and clear flammable materials to avoid or reduce all unnecessary losses. The Municipal Public Security Bureau has strengthened street control and has established temporary rules. The conference of public and private production institutions convened by the Municipal Government also stipulated measures to strengthen air defense.
