　　Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, February 9th: TASS, Budapest, February 6th: The Hungarian National Planning Bureau recently released a report on the completion of the plan in 1949 and the implementation of the three-year plan for the development of the national economy as follows:

　　In 1949, Hungarian manufacturing industry exceeded the annual plan by 8.8 percent. Compared with 1948, the average industrial output in 1949 increased by 42.4 percent.

　　All sectors of the Hungarian national economy have completed and exceeded the three-year plan in two years and five months (from August 1, 1947 to December 31, 1949).

　　The output of manufacturing and mining industries in 1949 exceeded the level that should have been reached upon completion of the three-year plan by 20.6 percent. The various departments of heavy industry have exceeded the 1938 industrial level by 74 percent.

　　In line with the three-year plan, agriculture has generally reached the pre-war level. The planting of new crops, especially cotton, has begun. In the process of implementing the plan, the socialist foundation of agriculture has begun to be laid. The area of state-owned farms has increased from 50,000 holds to 400,000 holds (one hold equals 8.7 mu). More than 1,500 agricultural production cooperatives have been established throughout the country.

　　At the beginning of the three-year plan, all wholesale and foreign trade were virtually controlled by capitalists, and the state and cooperatives only controlled 3 percent of retail trade. In the process of implementing the three-year plan, the government has completely controlled wholesale and foreign trade, and the retail trade controlled by the state and cooperatives has also accounted for 30 percent. Compared with 1946-47, the volume of foreign trade of state-owned enterprises in 1949 reached 375 percent. The volume of trade with the Soviet Union and various people's democratic countries has been increasing.

　　The implementation of the three-year plan has eliminated unemployment in Hungary. In the last year of the three-year plan, there was a strong feeling of insufficient supply of skilled workers, engineers and technicians.

　　The three-year plan stipulates that by August 1, 1950, the living standards of the working people should be 8 percent higher than the pre-war level. However, at the end of 1949, the actual wages of workers had exceeded the 1938 level by 40 percent.

　　In the process of implementing the plan, more than 20,000 workers and laboring peasants have been promoted to administrative positions in various departments of the national economy and state administrative organs.

　　The national income in 1949 exceeded that of 1938 by 24 percent.

　　The report of the National Planning Bureau concludes: "While fulfilling the three-year plan, the Hungarian working people have continuously fought against enemies at home and abroad. With the assistance of Soviet friendship and under the leadership of the Hungarian Workers' Party, the successful completion of the three-year plan is the high point of our national economic recovery. The achievements of the three-year plan have established a solid foundation for the implementation of the national economic five-year plan starting this year, and established a solid foundation for building a prosperous, strong, and culturally prosperous socialist Hungary."

　　确立建设社会主义的稳固基础
    匈超额完成三年计划
    去年工业产量平均较前年增加百分之四十二点四，农业已达战前水平
    【新华社北京九日电】塔斯社布达佩斯六日讯：匈牙利国家计划局顷发表一九四九年完成计划情况及发展国民经济三年计划执行情况的报告如下：
    一九四九年匈牙利制造工业，超过了本年计划的百分之八点八。和一九四八年相较，一九四九年平均工业产量增加了百分之四十二点四。
    匈牙利国民经济一切部门在两年零五个月（从一九四七年八月一日至一九四九年十二月三十一日）中，都已完成并且超过了三年计划。
    一九四九年制造工业和采矿工业的产量，已超过三年计划完成时所应达到的水平的百分之二十点六。重工业各部门已超过一九三八年工业水平的百分之七十四。
    和三年计划相符，农业大抵已达战前水平。新作物、特别是棉花的种植，已经开始。在计划执行进程中，已开始奠立农业的社会主义基础，国营农场的面积，在这期间内，已从五万霍尔德增至四十万霍尔德（按一霍尔德合八点七市亩”。全国已成立了一千五百多个农业生产合作社。
    在三年计划开始时，全部批发贸易与对外贸易实际上是由资本家控制着的，国家和合作社只掌握零售贸易百分之三。在三年计划执行进程中，政府已完全控制了批发贸易与对外贸易，国家和合作社控制的零售贸易，也已占百分之三十。和一九四六——四七年相较，一九四九年国营企业的对外贸易额，达百分之三百七十五。对苏联及各人民民主国家的贸易额一直在增大中。
    三年计划的实现已使匈牙利的失业现象绝迹。在三年计划最后一年中，已深感熟练工人、工程师和技术人员的供不应求。
    三年计划规定，至一九五○年八月一日，劳动人民的生活水平要比战前水平提高百分之八。但一九四九年底工人的实际工资，已超过了一九三八年水平的百分之四十。
    在实行计划的进程中，有二万余工人和劳动农民，已擢升至国民经济与国家行政机关各部门中掌管行政职务。
    一九四九年国民收入已超过一九三八年的百分之二十四。
    国家计划局的报告最后说：“匈牙利劳动人民在履行三年计划的同时，与国内外敌人不断进行斗争。在苏联友谊的援助与匈牙利工人党领导之下，三年计划的胜利完成，是我们的国民经济恢复时期的最高点。三年计划所获得的成果，确立了实现由今年起实行的国民经济五年计划的稳固基础，确立了建设繁荣、强大、文化昌盛的社会主义匈牙利的稳固基础。”
