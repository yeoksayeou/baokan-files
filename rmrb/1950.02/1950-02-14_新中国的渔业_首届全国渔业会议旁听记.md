　　The Fisheries of New China
    ——Notes from the First National Fisheries Conference
    By our reporter Bai Sheng
    The first National Fisheries Conference was held. Representatives from the Northeast, North China (Hebei), East China, and Central South (Guangdong) regions reported on the conditions of fishermen's lives, aquatic products businesses, and aquatic products education in their respective regions, and put forward various opinions on restoring and developing the fisheries of New China. At this conference, we saw the bright prospects for the development of fisheries in New China.
    Our country's conditions for developing fisheries can be said to be uniquely favorable. Our country is located in the warm temperate zone. From the mouth of the Yalu River in Andong in the north to the mouth of the Beilun River in Guangdong in the south, the coastline along the western Pacific Ocean is approximately seven thousand nautical miles long, and there are many harbors and islands, with vast fishing grounds. The coastal fishing grounds cover approximately 880,000 square kilometers. Freshwater fishing grounds include more than thirty large rivers and seventy large lakes. Within this vast fishing area, there are more than one hundred species of edible fish, such as saltwater fish like small yellow croaker, large yellow croaker, hairtail, mullet, cod, catfish, Spanish mackerel, flounder, anchovy, shark, abalone, and freshwater fish like carp, crucian carp, bream, grass carp, eel, etc., all of which are good edible fish. Before the war, the highest annual output reached more than 1.5 million tons. During the eight-year War of Resistance Against Japan and the three-year War of Liberation, Japanese invaders and Chiang Kai-shek bandits wantonly destroyed fishery facilities, especially fishing boats, fishing ports, aquatic product education, and processing factories, which suffered severe damage. In addition, the maritime blockade greatly reduced fish production. In 1949, the national fish production totaled 447,927 tons (most of the freshwater fish production was not included). We estimate that the national fish production in 1950 will recover to more than 700,000 tons. Precisely because our country has such a long coastline and vast inland fishing grounds, developing fisheries and increasing national economic income is of particular importance.
    Currently, the fish-producing areas in the Northeast region are mainly the Bohai Sea and Yellow Sea coastal fishing grounds, as well as the near-sea fishing grounds based in the Dalian and Lushun area. The main production areas for freshwater fish are the Songhua River, Nen River, Heilong River, Ussuri River, Jingpo Lake, Dalai Lake, Xingkai Lake, and other waters. The chum salmon and sturgeon of the Ussuri River in the Northeast region, the abalone among marine fish, the Jia crucian carp, as well as yellow croaker, and flounder are all extremely famous. There are more than forty types of fishing gear in the Northeast, including motorized winches, sailboats, drift nets, and barrier nets. The Northeast fishing ground is known as one of China's four major fishing grounds. After the liberation of the Northeast, the people's government has begun to gradually restore and develop the fisheries destroyed by the enemy. In 1949, the Northeast Department of Agriculture and Forestry established aquatic product administrative agencies, and aquatic product bureaus and sections were successively established in provinces, cities, and counties. The Jilin breeding farm was restored, and preparations are being made to restore two aquatic product experimental farms this year. At the same time, in order to solve the aquatic product supply and marketing work in various provinces, aquatic product enterprise companies were successively established in various provinces, and in many places, fishermen were mobilized to organize and establish fishermen's associations, fishery cooperatives, and mutual aid production groups.
    The coastline of East China stretches from the Bohai Bay in the north to the border of Fujian and Guangdong in the south. The fishing area covers approximately 283,000 nautical miles. Tropical fish are abundant in the south, and cold-water fish are abundant in the north. In the middle, the Yangtze River estuary and the Zhoushan Islands area have fresh and salt water exchange, a flat seabed, and abundant bait, with extremely rich yields of large yellow croaker and small yellow croaker. The total inland freshwater area in the region is approximately 40,000 square nautical miles, including the famous Taihu Lake, Hongze Lake, Gaoyou Lake, Yellow River, Yangtze River, etc.
    Currently, the total fish catch in East China is far from the pre-war level. Therefore, the current fishery production policy is still based on restoration, and Shandong will be the focus, strengthening fishing, developing processing, and vigorously organizing fishermen to accelerate the restoration of fishery production to alleviate disasters. In addition, freshwater aquaculture will be promoted to supplement the shortage of sea fish consumption.
    Regarding the fishery production situation in North China, only materials from Hebei Province were provided at this conference. Hebei Province has 21 freshwater areas, mainly including Baiyangdian and Daqing River, covering an area of approximately 15,000 square nautical miles. The fish production is mainly carp, crucian carp, salmon, eel, and white fish. The fishing gear is mainly nets, weirs, and fishing rods. In addition, the coast of Hebei Province has a unique harbor aquaculture industry. Because the coast of Hebei Province is all silty and sandy land, after introducing seawater and freshwater to converge, various types of fish can be brought in by the seawater. After natural breeding, the fish grow rapidly and the yield is abundant. This type of fish production is commonly known as "harbor fish."
    In addition, Taiwan is surrounded by the sea, with islands scattered like stars, and the sea surface is vast. Geographically and in terms of fish production and sales, it has naturally excellent conditions for developing fisheries. The fish production in Qinghai and other places in the Northwest region is also very abundant and is awaiting development.
    According to the reports from various regions at this conference, there are currently more than 600,000 fishermen across the country.
    The Northeast and East China regions have cold storage, processing plants, and canning factories. These factories are now mostly operated privately and dispersed.
    According to statistics, the production volume of old-style sailboat individual fisheries accounts for about 90% of the total national production, while the production of new-style motorized fisheries has not yet exceeded 10%. Therefore, it is currently necessary to strengthen the operation of public enterprises, while also strengthening leadership over private enterprises, so that individual operations can gradually be transformed into organized cooperative operations, in order to promote the development of fisheries.

　　新中国的渔业
    ——首届全国渔业会议旁听记
    本报记者  柏生
    首届全国渔业会议举行了。出席这次会议的东北、华北（河北）、华东、中南（广东）等区的代表们，分别报告了各地区渔民生活、水产业务、水产教育等各方面的情况，并提出了恢复与发展新中国渔业的各种意见，在这个会议上，我们看到了新中国渔业发展的光明远景。
    我们国家发展渔业的条件，可以说得天独厚。我们国家处在温热带。北起安东鸭绿江口，南至广东北仑河口，临太平洋西岸的海岸线长约七千余海里，而且有很多港湾岛屿，渔场面积广大。沿海渔场约有八十余万平方公里。淡水渔场则有较大的河川三十余条，较大的湖泊七十余处。在这广大的渔区区内，可供食用的鱼类有一百余种，如咸水鱼类的小黄鱼、大黄鱼、带鱼、勃鱼、鳕鱼、鲶鱼、鲅鱼、比目鱼、鳁鱼、鲨鱼、鲍鱼，以及淡水鱼类的鲤鱼、鲫鱼、鲋鱼、鳊鱼、青鱼、鳝鱼等，都是良好的可供食用的鱼类。战前全国最高年产量到达一百五十余万吨。八年抗日战争与三年解放战争期中，日寇蒋匪对渔业设施狂加摧残，尤其渔船、渔港、水产教育、加工工厂等，均遭受了严重损害。此外，海上封锁，也使鱼产量大为减少。一九四九年全国渔产量，共四十四万七千九百二十七吨（其中大部分淡水渔产未能计算在内）。我们估计，一九五○年全国渔产量将恢复到七十万吨以上。正因为我国有如此延长的海岸与广阔的内陆渔场，发展渔业增大国民经济收入，就具有特别重要意义。
    目前，我国东北区的产鱼区，主要是渤海、黄海沿岸渔场以及旅大地区为根据地的近海渔场，淡水鱼类主要产地则为松花江、嫩江、黑龙江、乌苏里江、镜泊湖、达赖湖、兴凯湖等水域。东北区乌苏里江的达麻哈鱼和鲟鳇鱼，海产鱼中的鲍鱼，嘉鲫鱼以及黄花鱼、鲙鱼等均极著名。东北鱼捞工具已有机船手操网、帆船风网、流网、墙张网等四十余种。东北渔场号称中国四大渔场之一。东北解放后，人民政府已开始逐步恢复与发展为敌人所破坏的渔业。一九四九年东北农林部设置了水产行政机构，并在各省、市、县先后成立了水产局、水产科。恢复了吉林增殖场，并准备在今年恢复两个水产试验场。同时为了解决各省水产供销工作，先后成立了各省水产企业公司，并在很多地方发动渔民组织起来，成立渔民会，建立了渔业合作社及生产互助小组等。
    华东区海岸线，北起渤海湾南至闽粤边境，渔区面积约有二十八万三千余海里。南部盛产热带鱼类，北部盛产寒带鱼类。中部长江口及舟山群岛一带，淡水与咸水交流，海底平坦，饵料丰富，大黄鱼、小黄鱼等产量极为丰富。全区内陆淡水面积共约四万平方海里，著名的有太湖、洪泽湖、高邮湖、黄河、长江等。
    目前华东全区渔获量较战前水平相距很远，因而目前渔业生产的方针，仍是以恢复为主，并将以山东为重点，加强渔捞业，开展加工业，并大力组织渔民以加紧恢复渔业生产来减轻灾荒。此外将提倡淡水养殖，以补充海鱼消费的不足。
    关于华北地区的渔业生产情况，这次会议上提供的只有河北一省的材料。河北省共有淡水地区二十一处，主要的如白洋淀、大清河等，面积约在一万五千平方海里左右。鱼产以鲤鱼、鲫鱼、鲑鱼、鳝鱼、白鱼最多。渔捞工具以网、箔、钓为主。另外河北省沿海有一种特有的养港渔业，因河北省沿海均为淤泥沙地，引海水与淡水汇合后，就可以由海水带来各种鱼类，经过自然养殖，成长迅速，产量丰富，这种鱼产俗称“港鱼”。
    此外，台湾四面环海，岛屿星罗，海面广阔，在地理上和鱼产销路上，都具有着发展渔业的天然优良条件。又西北区青海等地鱼产量也很丰富，均待发展中。
    根据这次会议中各地区的报告，目前全国各地渔民共计约有六十余万人。
    东北区及华东区均有冷藏库，加工厂，罐头工厂等设备。这些工厂现大部为私人分散经营。
    根据统计，目前旧式帆船个体渔业生产数量占全国总产量百分之九十左右，而新式机船渔业生产还未超过百分之十，因此目前必须加强公营企业的经营，同时对私营企业也要加强领导，使个体的经营逐步转变为有组织的合作经营，这样才能促进渔业的发展。
