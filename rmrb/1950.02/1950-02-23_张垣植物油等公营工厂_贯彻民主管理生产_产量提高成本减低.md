(Report from this newspaper) Zhangjiakou's public factories, including vegetable oil, brewing, and cigarette factories, have launched rationalization proposals and implemented a policy of democratic management of production, creating new records for increasing output and quality, and reducing costs. On February 1st, the vegetable oil factory produced 5,320 jin of oil in a single day, an increase of 35.7% compared to the average daily output in the first half of January, and an increase in oil extraction rate of 1.4%. The quality exceeded export standards. The monthly cost reduction is estimated at 39,000 jin of millet. Based on this new situation, the factory revised its February production plan, increasing it from the originally planned monthly output of 82,320 jin of oil to 111,720 jin. The brewing factory completed its task of producing four batches in January, exceeding the original plan by 3,061 jin, with a product rate of 24.32%, surpassing the highest product rate of last April by 0.22%. Costs were reduced by 15.8% compared to last December. To ensure the completion and exceeding of this year's first-quarter production plan, workers in various workshops of the cigarette factory have launched a new record-breaking campaign. In the cigarette rolling room, from February 1st to 5th, the loss of bobbin paper was reduced by 3.48% compared to the past. Comrade Yu Pinchao's machine number 4 set a new record by reducing the loss of bobbin paper to 0.17%.

The above achievements are mainly due to the thorough implementation of the policy of democratic management of production in various factories. To ensure the completion and exceeding of the first-quarter production plan, and to achieve a cost reduction of 7%, the management committee of the cigarette factory convened a meeting of workshop foremen to solicit ideas. Based on everyone's opinions, the management committee put forward an action plan for the entire factory. After formulating the production plan, the management committee of the brewing factory handed it over to everyone for discussion and launched a competition among the workshops to formulate their production plans. The factory also criticized the past tendency of the branch and trade union work to simply emphasize workers' welfare without focusing on production, strengthened the unity between the Party, administration, and trade union, and concentrated efforts on leading production.

Secondly, the improvement of machinery and equipment and the improvement of technology ensured the increase in output. After the vegetable oil factory transformed the main shaft, it accelerated the rotation; it also repaired three old oil presses and replaced parts, which greatly increased the oil yield. Hao Wanxiang of the cigarette factory created a machine for ironing wax paper, which can reduce costs by 23.4 million yuan per month. Li Deyu, the flavoring machine operator in the factory, installed an iron cover on the flue of the oven, saving 10 jin of shredded tobacco per day.

　　张垣植物油等公营工厂
    贯彻民主管理生产  产量提高成本减低
    【本报讯】张家口植物油、酿造、纸烟等公营工厂，开展合理化建议，贯彻了民主管理生产的方针，创造提高产量、质量，降低成本的新纪录。本月一日，植物油厂一天出油五千三百二十斤，与一月份上半月每日平均产量相较，提高产量百分之三十五点七，提高出油率百分之一点四。在质量上超过了出口标准。每月共可减低成本三万九千斤小米。该厂根据这一新的情况，重新修订了二月份生产计划，由原计划的月产油八万二千三百二十斤，提高到十一万一千七百二十斤。酿造厂一月份完成出产四锅的任务，产量超过原计划三千零六十一斤，产品率达到百分之二十四点三二，超过去年四月份最高产品率百分之零点二二。较去年十二月份减低成本百分之十五点八。纸烟厂为保证完成和超过今年第一季生产计划，各车间工人均纷纷掀起创新纪录运动。卷烟室从二月一日到五日五天内，盘纸的损失与过去相较，减少百分之三点四八。工友于品朝的四号车，以减少损失盘纸到百分之零点一七创造新纪录。
    获得以上成绩，主要由于各厂贯彻执行了民主管理生产的方针。纸烟厂为保证完成并超过第一季生产计划，达到减低成本百分之七的要求，管委会曾召集各工作室工长开会，发动大家出主意。管委会根据大家意见提出了全厂的行动计划。酿造厂管委会订出生产计划后，又交给大家讨论，并发动各车间订出生产计划，展开竞赛。该厂并批判了过去支部工作和工会工作单纯强调工人福利不面向生产的偏向，加强了党、行政、工会间的团结一致，集中精力领导生产。
    其次是改良机器设备，提高技术，保证了产量的提高。植物油厂改造天轴后，加速了转动；又修整了三台旧榨油机，配换了零件，使出油量大大增加。纸烟厂郝万祥创造了烫腊纸的机器，每月可减低成本二千三百四十万元。该厂加香机李德玉在烤炉风道上按了一个铁罩，每日节省烟丝十斤。
