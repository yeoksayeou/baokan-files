　　Cadres Lead the Masses in Vigorous Construction
    Northern Jiangsu Repaired 3,000 Li of Dikes Last Year
    Large-Scale Projects to Harness the Yi and Shu Rivers and Coastal Water Management and Land Reclamation Now Underway
    Last year, northern Jiangsu Province carried out large-scale water conservancy construction projects, including spring repairs, summer flood prevention, winter harnessing of the Yi and Shu rivers, and land reclamation. According to statistics, over the past year, the people of the entire region have fully repaired and focused on reinforcing nearly 3,000 li of major dikes along the Yangtze River, Yellow Sea, Grand Canal, Hongze Lake, and the Yi River, Shu River, Yan River, and New Huai River (i.e., the old Yellow River); dredged more than 270 main and tributary rivers in the lower reaches of the Yi and Shu rivers and various sea-bound waterways south of the old Yellow River; and dredged more than 8,000 small rivers and irrigation ditches. The newly dug Yunmian River and Nanchao River in eastern Funing County, as well as the Xinyi River in Huaiyin District, the Tangyu River in northeastern Lianshui County, and the Wutu River in Guanyun, which were recently completed in winter projects, total more than 600 li. More than 1,000 sluice gates and culverts were built. More than 1.5 million people participated, averaging half a month of work per person, with a total of more than 35 million cubic meters of earthwork completed throughout the year (including the construction of inner river dikes in various counties). The People's Government spent more than 249 million jin of grain for wages. This enormous construction reduced losses to 50 million mu of farmland and the lives and property of 20 million people in northern Jiangsu, and provided favorable conditions for future agricultural production increases.
    Spring Repair of 2,000 Li of Dikes Laid the Foundation for Summer Flood Prevention
    The spring repair project started in February and ended at the end of May, repairing 2,000 li of dikes along the Yangtze River, Yellow Sea, Grand Canal, and Hongze Lake, dredging more than 160 main and tributary rivers of the Yi and Shu rivers and sea-bound waterways south of the old Yellow River, newly digging more than 150 li of rivers such as Yunmian and Nanchao, and digging more than 3,200 small rivers and irrigation ditches. More than 400,000 people participated, completing more than 10 million cubic meters of earthwork. Among them, the largest project was the Grand Canal dike, which stretches 700 li each on the east and west banks from south of Yangzhou to north of Pi County, and was completed by the people of ten counties along the river in one month. This large-scale spring repair laid the foundation for summer flood prevention for thousands of li of rivers, seas, and dikes.
    The summer flood prevention project started in mid-June and ended in mid-September. Under the combined attack of floods, typhoons, and huge tides, the Party, government, army, and people of northern Jiangsu mobilized about 3 million people to work day and night to dig ditches, reinforce dikes, drain water, and release water, saving 80 percent of the more than 17.7 million mu of seedlings (accounting for more than one-third of the region's cultivated land) that were flooded in the inner river counties; at the same time, more than 500,000 workers were mobilized to focus on reinforcing and fully repairing a total of 2,500 li of dikes, including the Yangtze River dike in the south, the Yellow Sea dike in the east, the Grand Canal and Hongze Lake dike in the west, and the Yi, Shu, Yan, and New Huai River dikes in the north. By the 18th day of the seventh lunar month, before the major flood season, all locations had been repaired successively and then switched to defensive measures. Until late September, all dikes safely survived the four major tides of summer and autumn, except for the eastern section of the Yangtze River dike, which was severely attacked by a typhoon, and the northern section of the central Grand Canal dike, which suffered partial breaches and disasters due to the surge of the Yi River.
    During the Four Major Tidal Surges, Cadres Led the Masses to Bravely Repair the Dikes, Turning Danger into Safety
    The most intense part of the summer flood prevention project was the repair of the Yangtze River dike. After the Yangtze River dike was heavily attacked by typhoons and huge tides from late July, the soil collapsed and breaches overflowed on more than 100 main and tributary dikes along the line from Nantong to Yangzhou. At that time, more than 300,000 workers in Yangzhou, Taixing, Jingjiang, Rugao, Nantong, Haimen and other counties along the river, under the personal leadership of the People's Government and cadres at all levels of the Communist Party, braved the wind and rain to repair the dikes day and night; In Tianjiagang, Yangzhou County, more than 300 cadres and masses immediately lay down on the embankment with "human dikes to block the water" when the river water overflowed the embankment, blocking the river water from overflowing the embankment. When the masses in Doujiaqiao were repairing the Yangtze River embankment, due to the urgency of the situation and the lack of tools, they knelt on the embankment arm in arm to block the water, waiting for the equipment to arrive, so that the embankment turned from danger to safety. Leading cadres at all levels braved the rain to lead the workers to repair the dangerous dikes, often without sleep for five days and nights. Thanks to the efforts of all the cadres and the masses, the entire project was completely repaired and blocked in five days, and it continued to be raised and widened. In some dangerous places, retreat dikes were also built.
    After the end of the summer flood prevention, in mid-November, the entire northern Jiangsu started large-scale harnessing of the Yi and Shu rivers and coastal water management and land reclamation movements. As of the end of last December, the winter project of diverting the Yi and harnessing the Shu had ended, completing two-thirds of the entire project for the first two winter and spring seasons. The coastal water management and land reclamation project, which started in early December to build a 200-li sea dike from the old Yellow River in the north to Menlong Port in the south, has completed 2.8 million cubic meters of winter engineering with the efforts of 100,000 workers in five counties including Yancheng and Funing. The newly dug Tangyu River project in northeastern Lianshui County also completed the entire winter project by the end of December. A total of more than 400,000 people participated in the above projects, completing more than 12 million cubic meters of earthwork. The People's Government allocated 250.14 million jin of winter and spring project funds (as work-for-food relief). After the completion of all the above projects, it will ensure the safety of millions of mu of cotton fields along the coast, gradually expand the area of ​​cotton cultivation, and enable the seven counties in the north of the Huaiyin Special Zone to be free from the harm of floods for many years, and increase grain production by 500 million jin every year.

　　干部带领群众奋勇修筑
    苏北去年修堤三千里
    现又开始大规模治沂整沭和沿海治水兴垦运动
    江苏省北部去年曾进行了春修、夏防、冬季治沂、兴垦等大规模水利建设工程。据统计：一年来全区人民共全线抢修及重点加修长江、黄海、运河、洪泽湖及沂河、沭河、盐河、新淮河（即旧黄河）等主要大堤近三千华里；疏浚沂河、沭河尾闾各干支河流及旧黄河以南各通海河道二百七十余条，疏挖小河及流水沟八千余条。新凿阜宁县东部之运棉河、南潮河及最近完成冬季工程的淮阴区新沂河、涟水县东北部唐豫河、灌云五图河等共六百余华里。修建水闸、涵洞一千余处。参加民工一百五十万人以上，平均每人做工半月，全年实做土工（包括各县修筑内河圩堤工程）共三千五百余万公方。人民政府支出工资粮二亿四千九百余万斤。由于这一巨大的建设，使全苏北五千万亩良田及两千万人民生命财产减少损失，并为今后农业增产提供了有利条件。
    春修大堤两千华里打下夏防基础
    春修工程从二月开始至五月底结束，共修筑长江、黄海、运河、洪泽湖等大堤两千华里，疏开沂、沭各干支河流及旧黄河以南通海河道一百六十余条，新凿运棉、南潮等河一百五十余华里，挖小河及流水沟三千二百余条，参加民工四十余万人，实做土工一千余万公方。其中工程最大的运河堤南起扬州南，北至邳县北，东西两堤各长七百余华里，由沿河十县民工一个月修好。由于这一大规模春修，使数千里江、海、河堤打下了夏防基础。
    夏防工程从六月中旬开始至九月中旬结束。苏北党、政、军、民在洪水、台风、巨潮交相夹击下，一面动员约三百万人日夜突击挖沟、加堤、排水、放水，使内河各县被淹的一千七百七十余万亩（占全区耕地三分之一强）禾苗百分之八十脱水得救；一面又动员了五十余万民工，对南面长江堤、东面黄海堤、西部运河、洪泽湖堤，及北部沂、沭、盐、新淮河等堤共长两千五百余华里，分别进行重点加修和全面抢修，至农历七月十八日大汛前，各处都先后抢修完竣，并随即转入设防。至九月下旬各处堤防除长江堤东段因遭台风猛袭和中运河堤北段因沂水暴涨部分决口成灾外，其他各处都安然渡过夏、秋季四次大潮汛。
    四次大潮汛中干部带领群众奋勇抢修使堤防转危为安
    夏防工程最紧张的是修长江堤。江堤自七月下旬遭台风和巨潮猛攻后，南通到扬州沿线一百余处干支堤泥土倒塌和决口漫水，当时沿江扬州、泰兴、靖江、如皋、南通、海门等县三十余万民工，在人民政府和共产党各级干部亲自带头领导下，冒着大风雨昼夜抢修；扬州县田家港三百余干部和群众在江水漫堤时，即伏卧堤上用“人堤挡水”，堵住江水漫堤。窦家桥群众在抢修江堤中，因情势紧急工具缺乏，即以臂膀挽着臂膀跪在堤上挡水，等待器材赶到，使堤防转危为安。各级领导干部冒雨领导民工抢修险堤，多至五昼夜未睡。由于全体干部和群众的努力，五天即全部抢堵完工，并继续加高加宽，有些险要处还另修筑退堤。
    夏防结束后，十一月中旬，全苏北又开始大规模治沂整沭和沿海治水兴垦运动，迄去年十二月底止，导沂整沭冬季工程已告结束，完成第一期冬春两季全部工程的三分之二。沿海治水、兴垦工程，从十二月初开始修筑北至旧黄河、南至门龙港二百华里的海堤，在盐城、阜宁等五县十万民工努力下，已完成冬季工程二百八十万公方。涟水县东北部之新凿唐豫河工程，到十二月底亦已全部完成冬季工程。上述各工程参加民工共四十余万人，实做土方一千二百余万公方，人民政府拨出冬季、春季工程经费（以工代赈）二亿五千零十四万斤。上述全部工程完竣后，将使沿海数百万亩棉田得到安全保障，逐步扩大垦棉面积，并使淮阴专区北部七县免受历年水灾危害，每年可增产五亿万斤粮。
