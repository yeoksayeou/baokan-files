　　Reflections on the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance
    People from All Walks of Life Across the Country are Excited and Inspired, Supporting the Sino-Soviet Brotherly Alliance
    Zhu Kezhen
    Yesterday (February 14th), China and the Soviet Union signed three important international documents in Moscow: (1) the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance; (2) the Agreement on the Chinese Changchun Railway, Lushunkou, and Dalian; and (3) the Agreement on Loans. These three documents have established a foundation for stabilizing the international situation in East Asia, shattered the ambitions of Japanese aggressors and their masters, and consolidated the peace of the future world. This is not only worthy of the support of every person in the People's Republic of China, but also worthy of the support of every peace-loving person in the world. In the modern diplomatic history of our country, the Soviet Union was the first to renounce extraterritorial rights and concessions enjoyed in our country. During the Anti-Japanese War, the Soviet Union was the only country that could truly help us. After the establishment of the Chinese People's Government, the Soviet Union was the first friendly country to recognize us. In the international community, the Soviet Union is worthy of being our good teacher and helpful friend. The Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance, and the two agreements signed this time, fully demonstrate how enthusiastically the Soviet Union is assisting the Chinese people under the policy guidance of Marshal Stalin. We should thank the Soviet Union.

　　对于中苏签订友好同盟互助条约的感想
    全国各界兴奋鼓舞  拥护中苏兄弟同盟
    竺可桢
    昨天（十四日）中苏两国在莫斯科签订了三种国际重要文件：（一）中苏友好同盟互助条约。（二）关于中国长春铁路、旅顺口、及大连的协定。（三）关于贷款的协定。这三种文件，建立了稳定东亚国际局势的基础，打碎了日本侵略和其主子们的野心，并巩固了未来世界的和平。这不但值得中华人民共和国每个人民的拥护，也值得世界上每个爱好和平人士们的拥护。在我国近代外交史上，苏联首先放弃在我国享有的治外法权和租界地。在抗日期间苏联是惟一真能帮助我们的国家。中国人民政府成立后，苏联又是首先承认我们的友邦。在国际集团中苏联不愧为我们的良师益友。这次所订的友好同盟互助条约，和两种协定，又充分地表示出来苏联在斯大林大元帅所定政策指导之下，如何热情地在援助中国人民。我们应当感谢苏联。
