The Fenyang Special District Organizes Education Cadres from Various Counties to Inspect Primary Education Throughout the District
Primary Schools in the District Have Become Standardized; Leadership and Other Issues in Primary Education Still Need Further Resolution.
[Our Newspaper] In order to inspect and summarize the recovery, rectification, and development of primary education last year, exchange experiences among counties, correct conservative views and narrow empiricism in teaching, improve leadership style, and increase teaching efficiency, the Fenyang Special District of Shanxi Province organized a mixed "Observation Group." Thirty-four people, including education administrative cadres and principals of complete primary schools from various counties, participated and were divided into three groups to observe in various counties throughout the district. In addition to inspecting the enrollment of school-age children and the leadership methods and work styles of the education sections of various counties, they also visited thirty-eight primary schools at all levels. During the observation, some conducted demonstration teaching, while others attended classes, reviewed homework, participated in school meetings, teacher learning, recreational, and sports activities. At the same time, small forums were held with parents, teachers, and students for summaries. Finally, the three groups of the observation group gathered to study and summarize the education situation in the district, proposing several issues that should be addressed.
There are 138,114 school-age children in the nine counties of Fenyang Special District. Over the past year, the number of schools and students in the district has generally increased. The original number of schools was 965, and now there are 1,127, an increase of 17%; the original number of enrolled children was 55,977, and now there are 76,834, an increase of 37%; the original number of teachers was 1,648, and now there are 1,946, an increase of 18%.
Schools in various counties have generally become standardized. According to the "Observation Group's" understanding: at the county level, leadership has gradually attached importance to education work and has begun to help teachers learn and solve specific problems. Most county heads and CCP county committees personally gave lectures during teacher training. In addition, they personally helped the complete primary schools in their locations and regularly gave reports to the teachers of the complete primary schools to improve their political level. Teachers in various counties are generally active in their work. Most schools have teaching plans and examination systems, and have generally carried out grade division and class adjustments. Some schools conducted in-depth ideological mobilization among parents and students when forming classes.
In terms of teaching methods, most teachers are willing to conduct research and improvement. Nan Ying Complete Primary School in Xugou compiled supplementary teaching materials for arithmetic that are related to reality; Complete Primary School No. 1 collected local specimens and made plant, animal, and hygiene charts through craft courses, overcoming many difficulties in teaching. In order to appropriately take care of children who must participate in labor, Jiaocheng has increased the number of seasonal primary schools by more than 30 in the past year, and has formulated systems such as morning reading, night reading, half-day, and every other day, so that learning and production do not interfere with each other. Teachers in Xugou proposed correcting the careless work style, and in class and when grading homework, they set an example by not writing sloppily or using abbreviations, in order to educate and influence students.

Strengthen Children's Health Education - Special District and County Sports Games Will Be Held
The "Observation Group" discovered several problems in primary education. First: the relationship between the departmental work and the central work of the education sections of some counties has not been well resolved, thus neglecting departmental work and relaxing leadership over schools. For example, teachers at Xiaodian Central Primary School in Jinyuan could not teach arithmetic; the general affairs meetings of Chengguan Complete Primary School were not transparent for a year, causing disunity among teachers, and the education section did not know about it. Some teachers said: "It doesn't matter if we do well or badly, no one cares." In addition, most schools are not clear about the educational方針 [fangzhen] and purpose, and neglect children's physical health in teaching, lengthening class and self-study time, thinking that it is enough to have recess exercises and sports. In the future, leadership must be strengthened, and at the same time, attention must be paid to the health education of primary school students. The Special District plans to hold sports games and achievement exhibitions within this year, with counties as units for junior primary schools and the special district as a unit for senior primary schools.

Education in Plains and Mountainous Areas - Strive for Balanced Development
Second, the development of education in various counties is unbalanced: the enrollment rate of school-age children in counties such as Zhongyang (mountainous areas) is only 23.5%, while in counties such as Xugou (plains areas) it reaches 75.7%. The average number of students taught by each teacher (from the wheat harvest holiday to the autumn holiday this year) is 35 in Xiaoyi County (including voluntary teachers) and 51 in Xugou. Therefore, the Special District and county leadership should pay attention to education in mountainous areas and promote balanced development. In areas with more teachers and fewer students, the primary task is to mobilize students and consolidate schools; in schools with too many students, teachers should be appropriately increased according to work needs.

This Year, Universally Train Primary School Teachers - Focus on On-the-Job Teacher Learning
Third, the learning of on-the-job teachers in various counties is generally in a state of free flow. The basic reasons are: the leadership has not focused on inspection, testing, and commendation and criticism; teachers' self-consciousness is also poor, their political interest is low, and they feel that as long as they teach the class, everything is fine. Li Linsen, a teacher in Jinyuan, reads old novels every day and is unwilling to study theory; others have low levels and cannot understand the documents. Therefore, the leaders of various counties should pay attention to inspecting and organizing on-the-job teachers' learning. The Special District plans to universally train primary school teachers this year, with the counties responsible for junior primary school teachers and the Special District responsible for senior primary school teachers.

　　汾阳专署组织各县教育干部
    检查全专区小学教育
    全区小学已走向正规化；小学教育领导等问题尚待进一步解决。
    【本报讯】山西省汾阳专署为检查总结去年小学教育恢复、整顿和发展的情况，并交流各县经验，纠正教学中的保守观点及狭隘经验主义，改进领导作风，提高教学效率，特组织混合“观摩团”，由各县教育行政干部及完小校长等三十四人参加，共分三组赴全区各县观摩。除检查了各地学龄儿童入学情况，各县教育科领导方法与工作作风外，还参观了各级小学三十八处。观摩中有的进行了示范教学，一般是听课、参看作业、参加学校会议和教员学习与文娱体育等活动，同时召开家长，师生小型座谈会，进行总结。最后观摩团三个组集中研究，总结了全区教育情况，提出几个应注意解决的问题。
    汾阳专区九个县共有学龄儿童一三八、一一四名。一年来，全区学校和学生已普遍增加，原有学校九六五处，现有一、一二七处，增加了百分之十七；原有入学儿童五五、九七七名，现有七六、八三四名，增加了百分之三十七；原有教员一、六四八名，现有一、九四六名，增加了百分之十八。
    各县学校一般已走向正规化，据“观摩团”了解：县级领导上对教育工作已逐渐重视，并开始做到帮助教员学习，解决具体问题。大部县长和中共县委在教员集训时均亲自讲课。此外，并亲自帮助驻地完小，定期给完小教员作报告，以提高教员政治水平。各县教员一般工作积极。大部学校都订有教导计划及考试等制度，一般都进行了划年级和调整班次。有的学校编班时在家长和学生中进行了深入的思想动员。
    在教学方法上，一般教员都愿意进行研究改进。徐沟南英完小编出算术联系实际的补充教材；一完小采集当地标本，通过工艺课制成植物、动物、卫生挂图等，克服了教学上很多困难。交城为适当地照顾必须参加劳动的儿童，一年来增加季节性小学三十余处，并订出早读、夜读、半日、隔日等制度，使学习生产两不误。徐沟教员提出纠正粗枝大叶作风，在上课与批改作业中，以身作则，不草写不简写，以此教育与影响学生。
    加强儿童健康教育  将开专区、县运动会
    “观摩团”发现了小学教育中的几个问题，第一：有些县教育科的部门工作与中心工作关系尚未很好解决，因而忽视了部门工作，放松对学校的领导。如晋源小店中心小学教员不会讲算术；城关完小一年来开总务会议，经济不公开，造成教员不团结，教育科也不知道。有些教员说：“咱们作好也不显，做坏也没人管。”此外，大部学校对教育方针与目的不够明确，在教导上忽视儿童身体健康，拉长上课和自习时间。以为有了课间操和体育就够了。今后必须加强领导，同时注意小学生的健康教育，专署并计划在今年内，规定初小以县为单位，高小以专区为单位，举行运动会和成绩展览会。
    平原山区教育  争取发展平衡
    第二，各县教育发展不平衡：中阳等县（山岳地区）入学儿童仅占学童的百分之二三·五，徐沟等县（平原地区）达百分之七五·七。每个教员平均教学生人数（今年麦假至秋假间），孝义县为三十五名（义务教员在内），徐沟达五十一名，因此，专署与县领导上应注意山岳地区的教育，使其平衡发展；在教员多、学生少的地区，首要任务是动员学生，巩固学校；在学生太多的学校，要根据工作需要，适当的增加教员。
    今年普训小学教师  抓紧在职教师学习
    其三，各县在职教师的学习普遍处于自流状态。其基本原因是：领导上没有抓紧检查、测验与表扬批评；教员自觉性也差，政治兴趣低，感到只要教了课就万事大吉，晋源教员李林森每天看旧小说，不愿学理论；还有的是水平低看不懂文件。因此，各县领导上应注意检查组织在职教员学习。专署并计划在今年内普训小学教师，初小教师由各县负责，高小教师由专署负责。
