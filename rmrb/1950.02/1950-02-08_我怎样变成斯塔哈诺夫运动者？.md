How I Became a Stakhanovite?
    By Bóni, a Hungarian Textile Worker
    I can't write well because I didn't have the opportunity to go to school before. When I was nine years old, I was sent to work as a servant in the home of a wealthy peasant. I worked all day and was often sick, and I didn't even finish elementary school. At fifteen, I worked in a brick factory in the summer and in a textile factory in the winter.

    At first, I didn't think I would become a Stakhanovite, and it wasn't for fame. I just wanted to produce more. I was the propaganda officer of the picking workshop at the Old Budapest Bleaching Factory. Comrade Haner, the secretary of the Party's grassroots organization, often talked with me and helped me with many issues. We had long decided to read the Free People's Newspaper (the central organ of the Hungarian Workers' Party) during lunch. The twenty-one of us in the picking workshop discussed the issues in the newspaper every day, especially those related to the Soviet Union. Once, we saw that a Soviet female tractor driver increased production. Another time, we saw a female train driver whose performance was even better than the male drivers. There was also an article about female weavers who each managed seventy-five automatic looms. We discussed these things for a long time and considered them carefully. Gradually, we came up with a plan, but only the Party secretary knew about this plan.

    Our picking machines were tall, big, and long. Some had two rows of needles, and some had three. The needle-bearing shafts rotated, picking the velvet fabric. Each machine could hold four pieces, each piece fastened to another with needles. When the shaft rotated, it pulled the material into the machine, thus picking the velvet, which took about ten minutes. Afterward, it needed to be turned over and put back in to pick the velvet on the other side, which was another ten minutes. When the machine was working, there was no need to manage it, just to make sure it wasn't rolled up in a double layer, because that would cause it to break. This summer, I thought about how to increase production. The machines were old, and it was impossible to make new inventions. I thought I could make better use of those ten minutes and try managing two machines at the same time. I experimented in the workshop alone while cleaning the machine this summer, and it was successful. I told the Party secretary. We both agreed that it would only be effective if all the workers in our workshop used this method, managing two machines simultaneously.

    We decided that the current affairs discussions during lunch needed to be strengthened. For example, articles on how to improve labor productivity should also be brought up for discussion. If a person could produce more, then the whole country would benefit. Not only would their personal income increase, but all prices could be reduced. The results of these discussions were very good, and more and more female comrades were expressing their opinions.

    One day, the newspaper published a long article, which was Comrade Rákosi's speech at the Party Central Committee. We read it from beginning to end and discussed it.

    The next day, a female comrade, Bódicki's wife, came. She said that work teams were being organized in factories, and it would be best if we organized one too. My answer was: I've thought about this issue. My opinion is that we don't need to be constrained by formalities. Each person in our work team will manage two machines at the same time. She looked at me, was stunned for a moment, and then said, "Okay, let's try it."

    Thus, we started managing two machines per person. The first week, we completed 170 percent, then 180 percent, and then increased to 190 percent. The female comrades were very satisfied. The Party secretary saw that this plan was successful and wanted to help us make even better progress. He talked to the foreman, and the two of them came up with a way to put a metal mesh on the machine to prevent the material from rolling up in a double layer. This way, we didn't even need to watch the machine. In addition to managing two machines per person, we had extra time. My female comrades and I decided to manage three machines per person. Experienced workers stayed by the machines, and new workers went to work in the wool department. Managing three machines was also successful. We decided to manage four machines, but this required technical improvements because the distance between the machines was too far, and the fourth machine needed to be moved next to the other three. The Party organization in the factory helped, and this was also successful. Now, we manage four machines per person. One person is doing the work of four people, and labor productivity has increased. We heard that other workshops in the factory and other factories are also learning from our example.

    For several weeks, I have received many awards. First, at the Party organization's evening party, the Party secretary mentioned my name. Later, my working methods were also published in the newspaper. The Communist Committee of Greater Budapest invited me to sit with Kádár (Minister of the Interior, Deputy Secretary of the Hungarian Communist Party), Apró (General Secretary of the Trade Union), and the labor hero Weigel, Moszk. I felt that I did not deserve all these awards. I was just fulfilling my duty.

    I get a lot of wages, and I don't know how to use them well. I don't have any children, my husband is also working, our house is good enough, the furniture was bought two years ago, and we have a very nice motorcycle, which makes us very satisfied. Now, I bought two pairs of shoes, a sheepskin coat, and thick wool long boots. My husband bought a leather-faced coat. Production has increased, and wages have also increased. These are things that have never happened before.

    Now, I am called the initiator of the Stakhanovite movement in the Hungarian textile industry. It's true, I am the initiator in Hungary. But the real Stakhanovites, the real initiators, are in the Soviet Union. I just learned from them how to improve labor productivity. I hope that others will also learn from them.

　　我怎样变成斯塔哈诺夫运动者？
    匈牙利纺织女工柏尼
    我不会写好文章，因为以前没有办法进学校。我九岁的时候就被送到一个富农的家里当佣人，整天工作，常常生病，连初小也没有念完。十五岁的夏天，在一个砖瓦厂里做工，冬天，在一个纺织工厂里做工。
    起先，我并没有想到我会变成一个斯塔哈诺夫运动者，也并不是为了名誉，只是想到要多生产一点。我是旧布达佩斯漂白厂挑绒工场的宣传工作负责者，党的基层组织的书记汉而汉立同志常和我在一起谈话，在许多问题上，他常给我帮助。我们早已决定在午饭时读自由人民报（匈牙利工人党中央机关报），我们在挑绒工场的二十一人，每天提出报纸上的问题来讨论，特别是关于苏联的问题。有一次，看到一个苏联的拖拉机女司机使生产增加，又一次看到一个开火车头的女司机，她的成绩比男的还好。还有一次关于女织工们，她们每人管七十五部自动机。关于这些事，我们讨论了很久，考虑了很久，渐渐想出了一个计划，但是，除了党的书记之外，谁也不知道这个计划。
    我们的挑绒机又高、又大、又长。有的上面有两打针，有的有三打针。有针的轴转，将绒布挑缝，一次可容四匹，每匹用针与其他的一匹一起别起来。当轴转时将材料向机器里拉，因而将绒挑缝，这大概需十分钟。以后需翻过来，重新放进去，将另一面的绒挑缝，这样又是十分钟。当机器工作的时候，用不着管它，最多只注意不要双层卷起去，因为那是会断的。今夏我已想过，用什么方法可使生产增加？机器都很老，想要新发明是不行的。我想这十分钟可以用得好一点，可以试试在同时管两部机器。今夏擦机器的时候，我一个人在工场里试验过，成功了。曾告诉党的书记。我们两个人的意见相同，都认为只有使我们工场里的所有工人都用这一方法，一人同时管两部机器，那才有效。
    我们决定：在午饭时举行的时事讨论需要加强。比方说，像那样关于劳动生产率如何提高的文章，也应提出来讨论。假使一个人可以多生产些，那么，整个国家都好，不但他个人的收入增加，并且可以减低所有的物价。关于这些讨论的成绩很好，女同伴们发表意见的渐渐多起来。
    有一天，报纸上登了一篇很长的文章，那是拉科西同志在党中央的演讲，我们从头至尾地读了，并且讨论了。
    第二天，来了一个女同伴，鲍第琪的老婆。她说，现在工厂里都组织了工作队，最好我们也组织一个。我的回答是：对这问题我已想过了，我的意见是不必拘于形式，我们的工作队里每一个人将要同时管两部机器。她对我看看，呆了一回，然后说：“好，我们试试看。”
    这样，我们就开始一个人管两部机器了。第一个星期完成了百分之一七○，后来一八○，又提高到一九○。女同志们都很满意。党的书记看见这个计划成功了，要帮助我们进行得更好。他同领班谈了话，他们两个人想了个办法，在机器上放了个五金网，不使材料双层卷起去，这样一来，我们连看机器都不用了。一人管两部机器之外，还有多余的时间。我同女同志们决定了一人管三部机器。有经验的工人留在机器旁边，新工人到羊毛部去做工。三个机器的管理也很成功，我们决定管四部机器，但这需要技术上的改良，因为机器之间的距离太远，第四部机器需移到其他三部的旁边。厂里的党组织帮忙，这也成功了。现在，我们一人管四部机器，一个人做了四个人的工，劳动生产率提高了，我们听见厂里别的工场同别的厂也在学习我们的榜样。
    几个星期以来，我得到很多的奖励，先是在党组织的晚会上，党的书记提出了我的名字。后来，报纸上也登出了我的工作方法。大布达佩斯的共产党委员会请了我，同卡达（内政部长，匈牙利共产党副书记）；阿普罗（总工会总书记），还有劳动英雄韦改尔，莫司克坐在一起。我觉得所有这些奖励都不是我所应得的，我只不过是完成了我的义务。
    我得到很多的工钱，不知如何用法好。我又没有小孩，我的丈夫也在工作，我们的房子是够好的，家具也在两年以前买好了，还有一辆很漂亮的机器脚踏车，这些使我们都很满意了。现在，我买了两双鞋子、羊皮大衣、厚绒的长统靴子，我的丈夫买了件皮面大衣。生产增加了，薪工也提高了，这些都是以前从来没有过的。
    现在，我被称为匈牙利纺织工业的斯塔哈诺夫运动的发起人。真的，我是匈牙利的发起人。但是，真真的斯塔哈诺夫运动者，真真的发起人是在苏联，我只是从他们学来了怎么样可以提高劳动生产率，希望别的人也都向他们学习。
