Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, February 26th: A TASS dispatch from London: Some facts from the British parliamentary elections held on the 23rd prove the anti-democratic nature of the British electoral system. For example, the official list of candidates published in each constituency does not specify which party the candidate belongs to. This has drawn criticism from many people who intended to vote for a particular party but did not know which candidate belonged to that party. This situation occurred in many polling stations in the London area.

During the election, many people raised the issue of maintaining the secrecy of the vote. The Daily Telegraph and the Morning Post had to point out in their editorials the fact that the voter's registration number was recorded on the stub of their ballot paper. This violation of the principle of secret ballot has caused concern among voters. It is pointed out that this system is very useful for organizations such as "MI-5" (a secret police-style organization), which has extra-legal powers to find out the political attitudes of each voter by checking the ballots.

Some reports reveal that voters were subjected to various pressures during the election campaign. A Labour canvasser threatened to evict a female voter from a house built by the local Labour council because she was unwilling to vote for the Labour candidate. A Conservative landowner fired several workers because he heard them say they did not like Churchill. Such examples can be found across the country. Catholic priests threatened to excommunicate any parishioners who voted for the Communist Party.

　　英国选举不民主
    选民秘密投票的原则竟被侵犯  不投工党和保守党票即受威胁
    【新华社北京二十六日电】据塔斯社伦敦讯：二十三日举行的英国国会选举中的一些事实，证明了英国选举制度的反民主性质。例如，公布于每一选区的官方的候选人名单中，不指明候选人是那一个党的。这引起了许多人的责难，因为他们有意要投那一个党的票，但却不知道那一个候选人是属于该党的。在伦敦区的许多选举站上，都发生这种责难的情形。
    在选举当中，许多人提出了保持投票秘密性的问题。每日电讯报和晨邮报不得不在其社论中指出一个事实，即投票人的登记号码被记在他的选票的票根上。这个侵犯了秘密投票原则的事实，造成了选民的顾虑。据指出，此种制度对于如“ＭＩ——五”（按为秘密警察式的组织）等类的组织是十分有用的，这些组织有超法律的权力，可以借检查选票而寻出每一个投票人的政治态度。
    有一些报道透露，在竞选运动中选民曾受到各种压力。一个工党拉票员威胁着要把一名妇女投票人从当地工党委员会所建造的房屋中逐出去，因为她不愿投工党候选人的票。一个保守党的农主辞退了几个工人，因为他听到这些工人说他们不喜欢邱吉尔。这样的例子可在全国各地碰到。天主教的牧师们则扬言，凡投共产党票的教民，就要被开除教籍。
