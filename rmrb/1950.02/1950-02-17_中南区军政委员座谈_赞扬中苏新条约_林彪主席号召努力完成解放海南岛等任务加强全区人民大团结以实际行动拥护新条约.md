Xinhua News Agency, Hankou, 16th. The inaugural meeting of the Central and Southern China Military and Political Committee held a temporary symposium on the afternoon of the 15th, at its closing session, to celebrate the signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance. The symposium was presided over by Lin Biao, Chairman of the Central and Southern China Military and Political Committee. The committee members spoke successively for as long as two hours, and the atmosphere at the meeting was extremely warm.

At the meeting, Chairman Lin Biao stated first: The signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance, as well as the agreements between China and the Soviet Union on the Chinese Changchun Railway, Lushun Port, Dalian, and the agreement on loans to China, are major events that shake the world, and are the most important events in our current political life. These treaties and agreements are a major blow to international warmongers headed by US imperialism, to the remnant bandit gangs of the Kuomintang reactionaries, and to all imperialist elements in the world. On the other hand, they are the greatest encouragement to the people of New China who have won national victory, and a powerful encouragement to the people of various new democratic countries and colonial countries. This makes the forces of imperialism more isolated and weakened, and the world's peace, democracy and socialist forces, headed by the Soviet Union, are further strengthened through unity. Chairman Lin Biao called on everyone to take advantage of this international assistance and favorable conditions to do their work well, complete the tasks of liberating Hainan Island, eliminating residual enemies, land reform, and economic construction, strengthen the great unity of the people of all strata in the entire region, and support and celebrate this great historical event with practical actions.

Cheng Qian, Zhang Nanxian, and Others Speak

Subsequently, Cheng Qian, Vice Chairman of the Central and Southern China Military and Political Committee, and Zhang Nanxian, committee members Chen Mingshu, Liu Fei, Huang Qixiang, Fang Fang, Tang Shengzhi, and Li Xiannian all expressed their opinions. Vice Chairman Cheng Qian said: This is an unprecedented truly equal, mutually beneficial, and mutually assisting alliance treaty in Chinese history. Vice Chairman Cheng emphasized: In the past, imperialists and domestic reactionaries continuously slandered and attacked Sino-Soviet friendship, causing some Chinese people and people in other imperialist countries to be deceived and even harbor doubts about the Soviet Union. Today, the signing of this treaty completely shattered the enemy's malicious propaganda and slander. Vice Chairman Zhang Nanxian said: Since the Opium War, the Chinese reactionary traitorous government and imperialist countries have signed many treaties that ceded sovereignty and humiliated the country, and the people have suffered endless exploitation and plunder. Today, seeing this truly friendly alliance and mutual assistance treaty, I feel there is nothing more exciting than this. In the future, the people of the whole country should become more nervous and work hard to build our country. This is our responsibility. Only in this way can there be a guarantee for lasting world peace. Committee member Chen Mingshu said: This treaty and agreement is a positive response to the reactionary clamor and slander of the Truman, MacArthur, and Jesseps who attempted to organize the Southeast Asian reactionary alliance in Bangkok. The people of our country should pay tribute to our Chairman Mao and Marshal Stalin for their tireless efforts in the success of this great and epoch-making diplomatic relationship. Committee member Liu Fei said: The Soviet Union's loan of 300 million US dollars to our country in this new Sino-Soviet treaty is a great help to our economic recovery, giving us more power to build our country. We should make good use of it to build our country well. Committee member Huang Qixiang said: This treaty was formulated by China and the Soviet Union in the position of brothers and completely based on the principle of equality and mutual benefit. This treaty is not only a guarantee of friendly mutual assistance between China and the Soviet Union, but also a guarantee of lasting world peace and human happiness. Committee member Fang Fang said: The signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance is powerful and invincible, inflicting an invincible blow to imperialists attempting to launch wars of aggression. Since the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance has played a decisive role in safeguarding international peace, it has also powerfully guaranteed China's entry into peaceful construction after the war. Committee member Tang Shengzhi said that the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance specifically embodies the spirit of friendly cooperation between the people of China and the Soviet Union, powerfully guarantees the inevitable success of the construction cause of New China, and also shatters the shameless slander of imperialist warmongers and strengthens the great strength of the world peace camp. Committee member Li Xiannian said: The Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance strengthens the unity of the people of the two countries, thereby effectively preventing the re-aggression of Japanese aggressors and Pacific imperialists. This treaty will not only help the Chinese people consolidate the victory of the revolution and carry out economic and cultural construction, but will also further enhance the forces of world peace and democracy. Committee members Zhang Zhen, Peng Yihu, He Guiyan, Wang Yizhai, Li Da, and Qiu Zhe also made speeches at the meeting.

　　中南区军政委员座谈
    赞扬中苏新条约
    林彪主席号召努力完成解放海南岛等任务加强全区人民大团结以实际行动拥护新条约
    【新华社汉口十六日电】中南军政委员会成立大会在十五日下午的闭幕会上，临时举行庆祝中苏友好同盟互助条约签订的座谈会。座谈会由中南军政委员会主席林彪主持，各委员相继发言达两小时之久，会场情绪至为热烈。
    会上林彪主席首称：中苏友好同盟互助条约及中苏两国关于中国长春铁路、旅顺口、大连的协定和贷款给中国的协定之签订，是震动全世界的重大事件，是我们目前政治生活中最重大的事件。这些条约、协定对于以美国帝国主义为首的国际战争贩子，对于国民党反动派残余匪帮，对于全世界所有帝国主义分子，都是一个重大的打击；另一方面，对获得全国胜利的新中国人民是最大的鼓励；对各新民主主义国家，对各殖民地国家的人民则是有力的鼓舞。这使得帝国主义的力量更加孤立和削弱，以苏联为首的世界和平民主与社会主义力量，因为进一步的团结而更加增强。林彪主席号召大家利用这种国际上的帮助和有利条件，把工作做好，完成解放海南岛肃清残余敌人、土地改革、经济建设的任务，加强全区各阶层人民的大团结，用实际行动来拥护和庆祝这一伟大的历史事件。
    程潜张难先等发言
    接着，中南军政委员会副主席程潜和张难先、委员陈铭枢、刘斐、黄琪翔、方方、唐生智、李先念等都发表了意见。程潜副主席称：这是我们中国历史上空前未有的真正平等、互惠、互助的同盟条约。程副主席强调指出：过去帝国主义者和国内反动派曾不断对中苏友谊加以污蔑和中伤，使一部分中国人民和其他帝国主义国家内的人民受到蒙蔽欺骗，乃至对苏联发生怀疑。今天这个条约的签订，完全粉碎了敌人的恶毒宣传和造谣中伤。张难先副主席说：自鸦片战争以来，中国反动卖国政府和帝国主义国家，订了好多丧权辱国的条约，人民受尽压榨、掠夺。今天，看到这个真正的友好同盟互助条约，觉得没有比这更兴奋的事了。今后全国人民应更紧张起来，努力建设我们的国家。这是我们的责任。唯有这样，对世界持久和平才有保障。陈铭枢委员说：这个条约和协定是对杜鲁门、麦克阿瑟之流和在曼谷企图组织东南亚反动联盟的耶塞普等的反动叫嚣和造谣诬蔑的正面答复。我们全国人民对这伟大的划时代的邦交的成功，应向我们不辞辛劳的毛主席和斯大林大元帅致敬。刘斐委员说：这次中苏新约中苏联给予我国三亿美元的贷款，对我们经济恢复上是一大帮助，使我们更有力量来建设我们的国家，我们应好好地运用它，把我们国家建设好。黄琪翔委员说：这个条约是中苏两国以兄弟的地位，完全站在平等互惠的原则之下定出来的。这个条约，不独是中苏两国友好互助的保证，而且也是世界持久和平和人类幸福的保证。方方委员称：中苏友好同盟互助条约的签订，力量是伟大与无敌的，使企图发动侵略战争的帝国主义者遭受到无敌的打击。中苏友好同盟互助条约，既然在保障国际和平上起了决定的作用，因而，也使中国在战后步入和平建设得到了有力的保证。唐生智委员称，中苏友好同盟互助条约具体表现了中苏两大国人民友好合作的精神，有力地保证了新中国建设事业的必然成功，同时也粉碎了帝国主义战争贩子的无耻造谣诬蔑，加强了世界和平阵营的伟大力量。李先念委员称：中苏两国友好同盟互助条约加强了两国人民的团结，因而有效地防止了日本侵略分子和太平洋上的帝国主义者的重新侵略。这个条约不仅有助于中国人民巩固革命胜利、进行经济文化建设，而且将进一步增强世界和平民主的力量。在会上发表谈话的还有张轸、彭一湖、贺贵严、王毅斋、李达、邱哲等委员。
