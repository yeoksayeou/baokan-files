　　In Capitalist Countries
　　Translated by Zheng Tuobin
　　“There can be no real equality between the capitalist and the worker, between the landlord and the peasant; if the former possesses wealth and political power in society, then the latter is completely deprived; if the former is an exploiter, then the latter is exploited.”
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　——Stalin
　　Currently, in countries ruled by the bourgeoisie, there are at least 40 million unemployed and underemployed people. In the United States, according to official statistics, there are 14 million unemployed and underemployed, but in reality, the number is much higher.
　　Comrade Nefedova, a female weaver from the Orekhovo-Zuevo factory who once visited the United States, recounted:
　　“The owner of the house where I stayed was a window washer—an illiterate, healthy middle-aged man. I was surprised that he hadn't learned any skilled labor yet and had to wash windows!
　　“The window washer smiled bitterly:
　　“What else can I do? I am a car driver, and I am also very good at making locks. But I can't find a job according to my profession, but I have three children.... There are many unemployed people here who have technical diplomas...”
　　In capitalist countries, only the very wealthy can enjoy the right to rest. Capitalists spend huge amounts of money on their rest. For example, American millionaire Doherty spent $250,000 on one of his dance parties. The families of millionaires DuPont and Vanderbilt each have 500 cars.
　　In capitalist countries, there are many well-equipped and exquisite sanatoriums and summer resorts. However, these are all privately owned by capitalists. Laborers cannot step through the door. Prit, a famous British social activist who visited the Soviet Union, wrote:
　　“In England, what can we compare with the happy lives of millions of workers in the Soviet Union? They get paid vacations, spend their holidays in Sochi, Yalta, mineral pools, and other beautiful corners of nature. In England, 16 million people can't even get vacations without pay..."
　　Secondary and higher education is simply a distant dream for the working masses in capitalist countries. Because tuition is so expensive, the children of laborers are kept out of school.
　　American coal miner Bergens has a family of nine. The most educated person in his family is his sister-in-law, who completed the first grade in a middle school near Bergens' home. In this area, only 11,000 out of 19,000 school-age children attend school. Bergens' children did not attend school either.
　　In his message to Congress in January 1949, President Truman had to admit: "In many places, schools are inadequate... Millions of our children do not receive a good education. Millions of children are still learning outdated old curricula."
　　There is no health insurance in 49 capitalist countries, no old-age insurance in 41 countries, and no disability insurance in 53 countries. An accident occurred in the "Central No. 5" mine in Illinois (in the United States), resulting in 111 deaths. The cause of the collapse was the disrepair of the mine tunnel's ventilation ducts. One hundred and eleven people died, but the cost to the mine owners was extremely small, and the compensation they paid was only a few thousand dollars. It can be seen that the life of each miner is worth less than ten dollars.
　　In the past 19 years, 1,259,000 coal miners have died or been disabled in accidents caused by the factory's failure to ensure the safety of production technology.
　　There is no free medical treatment in the United States. Diagnosis, procedures, examinations—everything costs money, and it costs a lot.
　　The state does not care about mothers and babies at all. There are no free nurseries, kindergartens, or medical clinics, and it has never been considered.
　　A sailor who once served on the American merchant ship "America" recounted:
　　“...We brothers are most afraid of getting sick. It costs three dollars to see a doctor for a diagnosis, and five dollars if you ask the doctor to come to your home. If my wife or children get sick, then God help us. Sending a child to the hospital costs at least six to eight dollars a day. If it is in a better private hospital, it will cost ten to twelve dollars a day. Not long ago, I had two teeth extracted and three teeth filled, and I had to pay the dentist sixty-five dollars, which I will have to pay off over several months."
　　In bourgeois society, the oppression of women is a widespread phenomenon. Women under capitalism do the same work as men, but their wages are lower. For example, in the American processing industry, women's wages are less than 60% of men's wages. In many capitalist countries, women are deprived of the right to vote. In those countries where women have the right to vote, they are rarely elected to national representative bodies. Women in the United States account for more than half of the voters (60%). However, in the last Congress, women accounted for less than 2%, and there was not a single woman in the Senate. In addition to the national (federal) constitution, each state in the United States has its own laws. For example, according to the laws of one state, women cannot control their own wages; in another state, they do not legally own their own children; and in a third state, they are prohibited from participating in social life, and so on.
　　In various capitalist countries, a large number of citizens cannot participate in elections. In the seven southern states of the United States alone, 11 million people are deprived of their right to vote due to poll taxes and literacy restrictions.
　　Near New York is the city of Hoboken. The local Democratic Party machine headed by Mark Feli has ruled the city for 25 years. He is the mayor. Mark Feli has established a system whereby all city government employees are obligated to contribute a certain amount of their salary to Mark Feli's campaign fund. A small portion of the funds collected is indeed used for campaign activities. The rest goes into the pockets of Mark Feli and his deputies. Mark Feli earns a salary of $71 a week, but he has amassed a fortune of $3 million.

### 在资本主义国家里

　　在资本主义国家里
    郑拓彬译
    “资本家与工人之间，地主与农民之间，不可能有真正的平等；如果第一种人占有财富和社会上的政治势力，那么，第二种人就是被剥夺得一干二净者；如果说第一种人是剥削者，那么第二种人就是被剥削者。”
                                       ——斯大林
    目前，在资产阶级统治的各国，失业和半失业者，最少不下四千万人。在美国，据官方统计，失业和半失业者有一千四百万，实际上，远不止此数。
    曾经访问过美国的一位奥列霍沃——竹叶夫公司的女织布工人捏斐垛娃同志叙述道：
    “我曾住过的一家，主人是擦窗户玻璃工人——一个不识字的健康的中年人。我奇怪他至今什么熟练劳动也未学到，而只好去擦玻璃！
    “擦玻璃工人苦笑了：
    “这有啥法子呢？我是汽车司机，此外，制造锁头也很内行。但是，按照职业是找不到工作的，可是，我有三个孩子呀……。我们这里许许多多的失业者，他们都有技术文凭哩……”
    在资本主义各国，只有巨富们才能享受休息权。资本家把巨量钱财耗费在他们的休息上。例如：美国的百万巨富杜盖尔蒂，在其一次跳舞会上，便花费了二十五万美元。百万巨富杜邦和万德比的家庭，各有小汽车五百辆。
    在资本主义各国，有不少的设备优良的精致疗养所和避暑区。但是，这些全都为资本家所私有。劳动者无法踏进大门一步。曾访问过苏联的英国著名的社会活动家普里特写道：
    “在英国，我们有什么可以和苏联千百万工人幸福的生活相比拟呢？他们得到照发工资的休假，在索赤，在雅尔塔，在含矿质的池沼和其他地方，在真正的大自然的各个优美的角落里，渡其假期。而在英国的一千六百万人甚至连扣除工资的休假也得不到……”
    中等和高等教育，对于各资本主义国家的劳动群众，简直是渺茫的幻想。因学费高贵，便把劳动者的子弟关在校门之外了。
    美国煤矿工人别尔庚斯有一个九口之家。他家里最有文化的人是他的嫂嫂，她曾在别尔庚斯住家附近的一所中学中读完了一年级。这地方一万九千学龄儿童中，只有一万一千上学。别尔庚斯的孩子也未入学学习。
    一九四九年一月间，杜鲁门总统向国会提出的咨文中，也不得不承认：“在许多地方，学校不够……我国千百万儿童得不到良好的教育。千百万儿童还在学习着早已过时的旧课程。”
    在四十九个资本主义国家中没有疾病保险，在四十一个国家中没有老年保险，在五十三个国家中没有残废保险。依利诺斯（在美国）州的“中心五号”矿井里发生了一次倒塌事故，结果一百一十一人死亡。倒塌的原因是矿井坑道的通风管失修。一百一十一人死亡，矿主们所付出的代价却异常微少，他们所花费的恤金，不过数千美元。由此可知，每个矿工的生命，还值不到十块美元。
    在最近十九年间，由于厂方没有保证生产技术的安全而引起的事故中遭死亡或残废的煤矿工人达一百二十五万九千人。
    美国没有免费治疗。诊断、手续、检查——举凡一切，样样都得花钱，而且还得多花一些。
    国家对母亲与婴儿毫不关心。免费的托儿所、幼稚园、医务所是没有的，也没有想到过。
    曾在美国商船“亚美利加”号上服过务的海员叙述道：
    “……我们弟兄间，首先就是怕生病。到医生那里诊断一次，得花三块美元，假如请医生到家里来，就得花五块美元。我的老婆或儿女一旦生了病，那就请上帝保佑吧。送孩子入医院，每天最少得支付六——八块美元。若在照顾较好的私立医院，每天便要支付十——十二块美元。不久以前，我曾拔了两个牙，镶了三个，我要付给牙科大夫六十五块美元，这要我在好几个月时间内才能偿付呢”。
    在资产阶级社会，压迫妇女，是普遍的现象。资本主义下的妇女与男人做同样的工作，而工资却要少。比方，在美国加工工业中，妇女的工资，不足男子的百分之六十。好多资本主义国家中，妇女的选举权被剥夺了。而在那些妇女有选举权的国家，她们也很少被选到国家代表机关去。美国妇女占选民一半以上（百分之六十）。可是，在上届国会议员中，妇女不足百分之二，而参议院中，竟无一名妇女。美国除了全国（联邦）性的宪法之外，每个州还有各自的法律。比方，按照一个州的法律，妇女不能支配自己的工钱，在另外一个州，她们在法律上她自己的儿童不归她有，在第三个州里，她们被禁止参加社会生活等等。
    各资本主义国家内，有大批公民不能参加选举。仅在美国南方的七个州中，因有人头税和文化程度限制的关系，就有一千一百万人被剥夺了投票权。
    纽约附近，有一座荷波根城。以马克菲利为首的民主党地方党棍机关统治该城已有二十五年光景了。他系市长。马克菲利制定了一个制度，凡是市政府的职员，都有义务把自己的薪俸拿出一定的数量，作为马克菲利的竞选基金。所收集到的资金，一小部分确确实实用在竞选运动上。剩余的部分，都装进了马克菲利和他的副角们的腰包里去了。马克菲利每周领官薪七十一美元，但他却弄到了三百万美元的家产。
