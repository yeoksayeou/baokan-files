　　Great Efforts in Northeast China to Organize Employment for Unemployed Workers in Preparation for Large-Scale Construction Tasks
　　[Reported by this newspaper] To prepare for this year's large-scale construction tasks, cities in Northeast China such as Shenyang, Harbin, Jilin, Changchun, Qiqihar, and Jinzhou have been actively registering and recommending unemployed workers to factories and mines for employment. Incomplete statistics from the past three months alone show that 7,000 unemployed individuals have found employment. The People's Governments of Shenyang, Jilin, Harbin, and Changchun have recruited a large number of loading and unloading workers for the Benxi Coal and Iron Company. The Jilin Municipal People's Government organized an Unemployed Personnel Handling Committee, with various bureaus of the municipal government, district offices, police stations, cultural centers, and normal school students on winter vacation forming propaganda teams. They held mass forums to widely promote and mobilize workers to participate in national production and construction, and to appropriately address the living difficulties of the employed personnel's families. As a result, 329 people registered for employment in the city within four days. In cities such as Changchun, Harbin, and Qiqihar, the unemployed workers responded enthusiastically due to in-depth publicity campaigns. Liu Deshan, a farmer from Zhongheidong Village, Taipingling District, Dunhua, and others, upon hearing that the Benxi Coal and Iron Company was recruiting workers, wrote to the Jilin Municipal Labor Bureau on the 17th of last month to register and request an introduction, stating: "We are farmers who have been emancipated under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party. We have confidence in building our country. In order to develop the new China's industry, we are determined to register and participate in the construction of Benxi." The Jilin Municipal Labor Bureau has replied, granting them permission to register and proceed there. However, among the unemployed workers mobilized and registered in various cities, ordinary workers are the majority. In the future, greater efforts should be made to mobilize unemployed skilled workers for employment.

　　迎接大规模修建任务
    东北大力组织失业工人就业
    【本报讯】东北沈阳、哈尔滨、吉林、长春、齐齐哈尔、锦州等市为迎接今年大规模修建任务，纷纷登记并介绍失业工人前往各工厂矿山就业。仅据近三个月不完全的统计，即有七千失业人员就业。沈阳、吉林、哈尔滨、长春等市人民政府为本溪煤铁公司招募了大批的装卸工人。吉林市人民政府组织了失业人员处理委员会，由市府各局、各区公所、派出所、文化馆和寒假期中的师范学生组织了宣传队，召开群众座谈会，广泛宣传动员工人参加国家生产建设，并适当解决就业人员家属生活困难等问题，因而该市四天中，即有三百二十九人报名登记。长春、哈尔滨、齐齐哈尔等城市，由于深入宣传，失业工人应募者颇为踊跃。敦化太平岭区中黑顶屯农民刘德山等闻悉本溪煤铁公司招收工人，于上月十七日写信向吉林市劳动局报名请求介绍称：“我们是中国共产党领导下翻身的农民，有信心建设自己的国家，为发展新中国的工业，我们决心报名参加本溪建设。”吉林市劳动局已复信允其报名前往。但目前各市动员登记的失业工人中，以普通工人为多，今后应大力动员失业技术工人就业。
