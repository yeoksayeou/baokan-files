　　Pay Attention to Factory Hygiene Facilities
　　In Tianjin State-owned Textile Factories No. 1 and No. 3, due to extremely poor hygiene facilities, two to three hundred workers in each factory fall ill every day. According to the inspection report of Labor Minister Li Lisan, the Ministry of Labor, the Ministry of Textile Industry, and the Ministry of Health of the Central People's Government have formed a factory hygiene inspection team to conduct on-site investigations in Tianjin. Managers of factories across the country must pay serious attention to this matter.
　　In a New Democratic country, in state-owned enterprises of a socialist nature, it is completely unacceptable that our worker brothers and sisters are falling ill due to the lack of very simple hygiene facilities. Improving the sanitary conditions of toilets and canteens is not something that is impossible to achieve under the current economic conditions; however, our factories have not done so. What is the reason for this? There is no other reason than that the administrative departments of these factories do not closely care about the suffering of the workers, and they exhibit a bureaucratic work style.
　　As everyone knows, enterprises like China Textile are bureaucratic capitalist enterprises that we took over. When the Kuomintang bandit gang controlled these enterprises, they not only focused solely on their own profits, unwilling to pay attention to hygiene facilities related to workers' health, but also deliberately made factory hygiene facilities very poor in order to prevent workers' political activities and limit workers' loafing on the job. For example, regarding toilets, they deliberately made them very cold and dirty in winter, so that workers could not stay long when they ran from the high-temperature workshops to the freezing toilets, thereby hindering workers from possibly using the toilets to hold meetings. At the same time, they also attempted to limit workers from loafing on the job by "squatting in the toilet."
　　However, in our New Democratic state-owned enterprises, we absolutely do not allow this kind of situation that is hostile to workers and harms workers' health to remain. Our enterprise managers must care about the suffering of the workers. After we take over bureaucratic capitalist enterprises, we should improve the factory's hygiene facilities according to the necessary and possible conditions. Of course, when our national financial situation is still difficult, we cannot perfectly carry out construction work in this area; however, some necessary and simple hygiene facilities should be improved. The person in charge of every factory should understand that their primary responsibility is to rely on the workers to improve production. Without caring about the suffering of the workers, you will not get the support of the workers. Perhaps some people think that workers' toilets, canteens, etc. are all "small things" and do not need to be paid attention to. This view is completely wrong. Because it is precisely these "small things" that are related to the health of hundreds and thousands of workers. Every factory person in charge must carefully consider the difficulties of the workers and be responsible for solving the various difficulties among the workers that should and can be solved.

### 注意工厂卫生设备

　　注意工厂卫生设备
    天津国营纱厂中纺一厂和三厂，由于卫生设备太坏，每天每厂有两三百工人生病。根据劳动部李立三部长的考察报告，中央人民政府劳动部、纺织工业部与卫生部已组成工厂清洁卫生检查组去天津实地考察。全国各工厂的管理人员，对此事必须加以严重注意。
    在新民主主义国家里，在社会主义性质的国营企业中，我们的工人弟兄竟至于因为缺乏极为简单的卫生设备，而使许多工人生病，这是完全不应有的现象。把厕所、食堂的卫生情况改善一下，这并不是目前经济条件下办不到的事情；可是，我们这些工厂并没有这样作。这究竟是什么原因呢？没有别的，这表示这些工厂行政方面没有密切关心工人的疾苦，他们存在着官僚主义作风。
    众所周知，像中纺这样的企业，是我们接收的官僚资本企业。在国民党匪帮掌握这些企业的时候，他们不仅专为自己的利润打算，不肯注意有关工人健康的卫生设施；而且为了防止工人的政治活动，以及限制工人的怠工，曾经故意把工厂卫生设备弄得很坏。例如对于厕所，他们在冬季里故意把它弄得很冷很脏，使工人从高温的车间跑到冰冷的厕所时，没法久停，借以阻挠工人可能利用厕所开会。同时也企图由此限制工人借“蹲厕所”来怠工。
    但是我们新民主主义的国家企业中，绝对不容许再保留这种敌视工人、损害工人健康的情况。我们的企业管理人员必须关心工人的疾苦。当我们接管了官僚资本的企业之后，就应该按照必要与可能的条件，来改善工厂的卫生设备。当然，当我们的国家财政情况正处在困难的时候，我们不可能完满地从事这方面的建设工作；但是一些必要而又简单的卫生设备，则是应该设法改进的。每一个工厂的负责人员，都应该了解自己的首要责任就是依靠工人，搞好生产。不关心工人疾苦，是不会得到工人支持的。也许有人以为：工人厕所、食堂等全是些“小事情”，用不着去注意。这种看法是完全错误的。因为正是这些“小事情”，关系着成百成千工人的健康。每一个工厂负责人员，必须细心体贴工人的困难，负责解决工人中应当而且可能解决的各种困难。
