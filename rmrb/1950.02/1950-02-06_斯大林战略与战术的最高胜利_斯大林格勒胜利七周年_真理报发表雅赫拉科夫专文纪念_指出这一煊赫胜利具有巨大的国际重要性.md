Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, February 5th: TASS Moscow News: February 2nd was the seventh anniversary of the Soviet Army's great victory in Stalingrad. Colonel Yakhrakov wrote in the *Truth Daily* that the Battle of Stalingrad has become a model in the history of war for solving one of the most complex and difficult problems in military art – encircling and annihilating the enemy's massive concentration of forces. The Battle of Stalingrad had a decisive impact on the entire course of World War II. It was the most outstanding victory in the history of war, the supreme victory of Stalin's technology in the art of war, and the supreme victory of Stalin's strategy and tactics.

After gathering all available reserves, the Hitler bandit headquarters launched an offensive in the summer of 1942, with the aim of seizing Moscow through a large encirclement. At that time, the Hitler's Wehrmacht could no longer rush about on several strategic fronts simultaneously as it had in 1941. However, because there was no second front in Europe, it still controlled a large number of reserves and could attack on a selected front. This was possible because the ruling groups of the United States and Britain were carrying out criminal procrastination in opening a European front. The situation in the summer of 1942 was unfavorable to the Soviet army. At that time, the Soviet army had to deal with 70 percent of all the fascist forces, while Hitler's army used only 1.5 percent to deal with the Anglo-American forces in Africa. Hitler attempted to encircle Moscow from the east in the summer of 1942, cutting off its connection with the Volga River and the Urals, and then capturing Moscow. They dreamed of occupying Stalingrad on July 25th, thereby linking Japan and Turkey in the war against the Soviet Union.

During the Battle of Stalingrad, the far-reaching foresight of Stalin, the Supreme Commander of the Soviet Army, was clearly demonstrated. Stalin keenly and promptly exposed the German invaders' plan and took decisive steps to defeat the enemy. From the beginning to the end of the Battle of Stalingrad, Stalin personally directed the military operations every day. His instructions were brilliantly executed. On the outskirts of Stalingrad, the enemy was practically exhausted. The Battle of Stalingrad demonstrated the supreme heroism and bravery of the Soviet people in defending the great achievements of socialism.

The brilliant victory of Stalingrad has tremendous international significance. It injected fresh strength into the people groaning under fascist enslavement, encouraged them, and strengthened their resistance to the German fascist aggressors. In order to express their gratitude to the Soviet army and their respect for the heroism of the Soviet army, the working people of many countries in the world have named many squares and streets after Stalingrad.

　　斯大林战略与战术的最高胜利
    斯大林格勒胜利七周年
    真理报发表雅赫拉科夫专文纪念
    指出这一煊赫胜利具有巨大的国际重要性
    【新华社北京五日电】塔斯社莫斯科讯：二月二日是苏军在斯大林格勒赢得了伟大胜利的七周年纪念日。雅赫拉科夫上校在真理报上撰文称：斯大林格勒之战，已成为战争史上解决军事艺术上最复杂、最困难的问题之一——包围并歼灭敌人庞大的集中部队——的典范。斯大林格勒之战，对第二次世界大战的整个进程有决定性的影响。它是战争史上最杰出的胜利，它是战争艺术上斯大林技术的最高胜利，是斯大林战略与战术的最高胜利。
    希特勒匪帮司令部在集合了一切可资调动的后备部队之后，就在一九四二年夏季发动了进攻，目的在于用大包抄运动来夺取莫斯科。那时，希特勒的国防军已经不能像一九四一年那样同时在好几个战略方面狼奔豕突了，但是，由于欧洲没有第二战场，所以仍然控制着大批后备力量，可以向选中的一方面进攻，这之所以可能，是因为美英统治集团在开辟欧洲战场上进行罪恶的怠工。一九四二年夏天的战局，对苏军是不利的。那时，苏军必须要与法西斯军队全部的百分之七十周旋，而希特勒的军队，只有百分之一·五是用来对付非洲的英美联军的。希特勒企图在一九四二年夏由东侧包抄莫斯科，切断它和伏尔加河与乌拉尔的联系，然后攻占莫斯科。他们梦想在七月二十五日占领斯大林格勒，从而把日本与土耳其的参加对苏战争联结起来。
    在斯大林格勒战役中，苏军最高统帅斯大林的深远的预见很明显地表现了出来。斯大林机敏而及时地揭破了德寇的计划，并且采取了有决定性的步骤来击溃敌人。从斯大林格勒之战开始直至结束，斯大林每天都在亲自指挥着军事行动。他的训令被光辉地执行着。在斯大林格勒城边，敌人实际上精疲力竭了。斯大林格勒之战表现出保卫社会主义伟大成果的苏联人民的最高的英雄主义和刚勇。
    斯大林格勒的煊赫的胜利，是具有巨大的、国际重要性的。它给在法西斯奴役下呻吟的人民注入了新鲜的力量，鼓励了他们并且加强了他们对德国法西斯侵略者的反抗。世界上许多国家的劳动人民，为了表示他们对苏军的感谢和对苏军的英雄主义的敬意，已经把许多广场和街道命名为斯大林格勒。（附图片）
