Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, February 17th: More than 40,000 overseas Chinese in North Korea, while celebrating the Spring Festival, heard the news of the signing of the Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance between the motherland and the Soviet Union and other agreements. All were extremely excited and unanimously cheered enthusiastically for this epoch-making great event. The "Democratic Overseas Chinese," the organ publication of the Overseas Chinese Federation, issued a special edition on the 17th, which was eagerly read and celebrated by overseas Chinese from all walks of life. Zhao Lingde, Chairman of the Overseas Chinese Federation, said in a speech: "The Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance between China and the Soviet Union, concluded by nearly 700 million people, is completely invincible in its justice and strength. This treaty and other agreements provide a solid guarantee for the victory of the Chinese people and will have a significant impact on the peace and security of the Far East and the world. We resolutely support this wise decision of Chairman Mao and Marshal Stalin. We must firmly unite the overseas Chinese in Korea and express our support with practical actions." The Federation has notified the branch associations in various provinces, cities, and counties to hold overseas Chinese celebration meetings on the 20th of this month, respectively, where leading cadres will convey the contents of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance and other agreements, as well as their great political significance.
