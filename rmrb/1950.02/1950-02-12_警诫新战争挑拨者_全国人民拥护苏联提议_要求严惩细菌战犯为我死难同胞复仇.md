Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, February 11th: People across the country unanimously demand severe punishment for Japanese germ warfare criminals, headed by Hirohito. Li Chang, Secretary of the Communist Youth League Huadong Working Committee, and Zhang Ben, Secretary of the Shanghai Municipal Working Committee, both stated: All members of the Communist Youth League and the broad masses of young people in Shanghai and East China resolutely demand severe punishment for this group of heinous war criminals. Workers in factories in Shanghai have held symposiums one after another, unanimously pointing out that Japanese germ warfare criminals must receive due punishment. Military and government organs, local organizations of democratic parties in the city, as well as Long Yue, Ding Chaowu, Dai Ji, He Xiehou, and other members of the East China Military and Political Committee, have all issued written statements or made speeches, unanimously believing that in order to prevent the recurrence of germ warfare and warn instigators of new wars of aggression, the five major war criminals, headed by Japanese Emperor Hirohito, must be immediately interrogated. The Preparatory Committee of the Democratic Women's Federation of Southern Anhui, the Physicians' Associations of Wuxi, Wuhu, and Fuzhou, and people from all walks of life have also expressed the same demand.
The Central South Federation of Trade Unions and the Wuhan Federation of Trade Unions issued written statements stating: Our two million worker brothers in Central South and Wuhan resolutely demand the trial of the five major Japanese germ warfare criminals, especially the Japanese Emperor, who is the chief culprit among the war criminals, and should no longer be allowed to remain at large. People's organizations in Hubei and Henan provinces and Nanning City, Guangxi Province, have also issued statements demanding the trial of war criminals.
Burhan, Chairman of Xinjiang Province, believes that the Soviet Union's exposure and proposal to try Japanese war criminals for this crime represents the will of all peace-loving people in the world. Majiti, Minister of the Organization Department of the Xinjiang Peace and Democracy League, said: American imperialism is also oppressing the people and will naturally protect these germ warfare criminals to maintain their common interests. The Soviet Union's proposal to try Japanese germ warfare criminals this time is for the safety of all mankind. All of us in Xinjiang, especially the members of the New League, express our unanimous support and demand severe punishment for these war criminals. Zhang Xiaozong, professor of bacteriology at Northwest University, wrote: This atrocity is intolerable to all scientists. In order to maintain the development of progressive science, we support the Soviet Union's proposal to try Japanese germ warfare criminals.
People from all walks of life in the Lushun-Dalian area and Heilongjiang Province have also expressed their support for the just proposal of the Soviet Union. Dr. Wei Xi, professor at Dalian University, wrote to the Lushun-Dalian People's Daily, exposing the fact that Japanese bandits spread plague bacteria in the Qu County area of Zhejiang in 1941, stating: I personally saw the cotton with bacteria dropped by Japanese planes, as well as the plague bacillus smears taken from patients. This blood debt of slaughtering the Chinese people must be repaid by Japanese war criminals. Yu Yifu, Chairman of Heilongjiang Province, said with great anger about the bacterial disasters suffered by the people of the province: Japanese bandits set up a bacteria factory in Anda County, using living people as experimental subjects. According to local residents who witnessed it, 50 compatriots were used as experimental subjects and died. After the recurrence of cholera and plague bacteria spread by Japanese bandits in 1947, more than 20,000 people died in the four counties of Kaitong, Dalai, Taonan, and Zhenlai alone. Therefore, all the people in our province sincerely support the Soviet government's proposal and Vice Minister Li's reply to the Soviet Union, demanding severe punishment for germ warfare criminals and avenging our dead compatriots.
In addition, people's organizations and democratic parties in Chongqing, and people from all walks of life in Shijiazhuang, have also demanded the punishment of Japanese germ warfare criminals.
Newspapers in Hankou, Changsha, Xi'an, Qingdao, and Chongqing have published commentaries on this matter. A commentary in the Chongqing Xinhua Daily stated: It is necessary to severely and justly punish these public enemies of mankind. This will be a warning to all warmongers who incite war.

　　警诫新战争挑拨者
    全国人民拥护苏联提议
    要求严惩细菌战犯  为我死难同胞复仇
    【新华社北京十一日电】全国各地人民一致要求严惩以裕仁为首的日本细菌战犯。青年团华东工作委员会书记李昌、上海市工作委员会书记张本一致表示：上海和华东全体青年团员以及广大青年群众坚决要求严惩这批万恶的战犯。上海各工厂职工们都纷纷召开座谈会，一致指出日本细菌战犯必须得到应有的惩罚。该市各军政机关、各民主党派地方组织，以及华东军政委员会委员龙跃、丁超五、戴戟、何燮侯等，都发表了书面声明或谈话，一致认为为了制止细菌战争的再起和警诫新侵略战争的挑拨者，必须立即审讯以日本天皇裕仁为首的五大战犯。皖南区民主妇女联合会筹委会，无锡、芜湖和福州的医师协会及其他各界人民也表示了相同的要求。
    中南总工会和武汉市总工会发表书面声明称：我们中南和武汉的两百万工人兄弟坚决要求审讯日本五大细菌战犯，特别是日本天皇更是战犯中的元凶首恶，不能再让他逍遥法外。湖北、河南两省和广西省南宁市的各人民团体也都纷纷发表要求审判战犯声明。
    新疆省主席鲍尔汉认为苏联对日本战犯这一罪行的揭发并提议审讯，是代表了世界所有爱好和平的人民的意志。新疆保卫和平民主同盟组织部部长马吉提说：美帝国主义同样是压迫人民的，自然要包庇这些细菌战犯，来维护他们一致的利益。这次苏联提议审讯日本细菌战犯，是为了全世界人类的安全。我们全新疆人民尤其是新盟会员表示一致拥护，并要求对这些战犯严厉惩办。西北大学细菌学教授张效宗撰文称：这一暴行是一切科学家所不能容忍的，为了维护进步科学的发展，我们拥护苏联审讯日本细菌战犯的提议。
    旅大区、黑龙江省各界人民，亦纷纷表示拥护苏联正义的提议。大连大学教授魏曦医学博士投书旅大人民日报，揭露一九四一年日寇在浙江衢县地区散布鼠疫细菌的事实称：我曾亲眼看见日寇飞机投下来的附有细菌的棉花，以及从患者身上取出的鼠疫杆菌涂片。这种屠杀中国人民的血债一定要日本战犯来偿还的。黑龙江省主席于毅夫以该省人民遭受细菌的灾害而痛愤地说：日寇在安达县设立细菌工厂，以活人做实验品，仅据当地住民目睹者，即有五十名同胞被充为实验品而致死亡。一九四七年日寇散布各地的霍乱、鼠疫毒菌复发后，仅开通、大赉、洮南、镇赉四县即有二万余人死于非命。因此我们全省人民竭诚拥护苏联政府的提议及李副部长覆苏照会，要求严惩细菌战犯，为死难同胞复仇。
    此外，重庆各人民团体及各民主党派、石家庄各界人民也都纷纷要求惩办日本细菌战犯。
    汉口、长沙、西安、青岛、重庆等地报纸则纷纷为此发表评论。重庆新华日报时评称：严厉而公正地惩罚人类的这些公敌是必需的，这将是对一切煽动战争的战争贩子的警告。
