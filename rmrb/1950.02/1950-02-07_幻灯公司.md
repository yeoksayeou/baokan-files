　　“Slide Company”
　　A “Slide Company” has appeared on the top of Taihang Mountain. This “company” owns five hundred slides, and it often uses its novel and farmer-beloved subjects to encourage the enthusiasm of thousands upon thousands of farmers for production and construction.
　　Every performance of the "Slide Company" always attracts audiences packed like sardines. Within the boundaries of Heshun County, from the grand county-wide "General Merchandise Fair" and "Mule and Horse Fair" venues, all the way to remote mountain villages, most farmers have seen this emerging art. Farmers have gained joy and comfort from the "Slide Company's" screenings, as well as education and enlightenment. The "Slide Company" has begun to challenge the old operas occupying the rural cultural positions and has achieved gratifying victories. At the Qingcheng temple fair, the "Slide Company" and the old opera met. Thousands of farmers crowded in front of the slide screen, while very few people went to see the old opera being performed.
　　The growth of this "Slide Company" has only been a few short months.
　　In the spring of 1949, the Propaganda Department of the Heshun County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party initially sent people to the Fine Arts Department of the Former Taihang Area Federation of Literary and Art Circles to learn how to make and project slides. In March, Heshun County established the People's Cultural Center and sent people to the Taihang Federation of Literary and Art Circles' Fine Arts Department for the second time to study. This time, they fully learned the techniques of making light boxes, drawing slides, and projecting slides. After short-term experimentation and practice, on the eighteenth day of the fourth lunar month, Heshun County's slides met the people for the first time. Since then, it has grown and strengthened step by step, moving from the city to the countryside, spreading its influence among millions of farmers.
　　Heshun County's slide films have always been coordinated with the current central work and have been based on local materials from the very beginning, so they always have novel, rich, lively, and combative content. Initially, the "Slide Company" screened films such as "Production Plan of Taihang Area," "Burden Policy," "Labor Heroes," "Transforming Slackers," "Women Weeding Seedlings," "Sideline Production," and "Organize Ourselves," based on the content drafted by the Fine Arts Department of the Federation of Literary and Art Circles. During the "Disaster Resistance Production" and "Saving for Famine" campaigns, they combined local people's thoughts and drew new slides. Later, they added "Summary of the People's Liberation War in Three Years," "Female Hero Liu Hulan," and the newly compiled story "Nine Pieces of Clothing," etc. By now, there are about five hundred slides, all of which are subjects that farmers love to see and hear. In order to coordinate the development of rural maternal and child health work, they produced a new film, "How to Raise a Baby."
　　The "Slide Company" also put the story of Zhang Erhai of Neiyang Village applying more topdressing when planting hemp the year before last and getting a large harvest, and the experience of Dongguan cadres mobilizing farmers to apply topdressing, onto the screen to promote farmers to apply topdressing when weeding seedlings. During the manure accumulation campaign, they screened the story of the Women's Federation Chairman of Shayu Village cutting artemisia to accumulate manure. These vivid examples have the greatest educational significance for farmers. Farmers responded that watching a slide show "stimulates the mind more than attending a meeting," and "is stronger than attending a lecture at a people's school"; cadres from various districts also frequently requested screenings in their districts.
　　Encouraged by the masses, Heshun County's slide technology has gradually improved. They tried to turn the slides into "sound slides." The sound of airplanes was matched with an organ, the sound of cannons with a big drum, as well as the sounds of trains, cars, horse carts, shouts, sighs,... all appeared in conjunction with the screen. This made the scene even more realistic. At each performance, the audience listened intently to the activity on the screen in complete silence. Recently, Heshun County has also introduced "double-layered animated slide" slides, with moving images matching the fixed screen. This often makes the audience feel surprised: "Ah! Not simple, the dog is running over here." "Look, look, the shepherd is coming too!"
　　Farmers enthusiastically put forward many criticisms and suggestions about the slides. Initially, some of Heshun County's slides were crudely drawn. The farmers made a suggestion: "Please hire a good painter, it would be even better if it was drawn vividly." Sometimes, when the narrator's explanation was unclear or the light was poor, the masses would request "Speak more clearly! Project brighter! Pull more steadily!" These prompted Heshun's slides to gradually correct shortcomings, and the technology became increasingly refined.
　　Due to the continuous improvement of the content of the slides, the masses loved it even more. Whenever the "Slide Company" arrives in a village, it is surrounded by adults and children, requesting to perform several more times. Sometimes, when the people projecting the slides pass through a village, if the masses find out, they will chase them three or five li out of the village and pull them back, insisting on staying for a night's performance. The farmers call the slides "native movies," and some call them "gas movies" (because they are projected with gas lamps). The people projecting the slides are called "Slide Company" by the farmers. In fact, this "company" now only has two people and a simple set of equipment, but their footprints have spread throughout Heshun, and their work is influencing tens of thousands of farmers, encouraging the farmers' rising production enthusiasm.

### “幻灯公司”

　　“幻灯公司”
    太行山顶上出现了一个“幻灯公司”。这个“公司”拥有五百个片子，经常以它新颖而为农民所喜爱的题材，鼓舞着成千成万农民对生产建设的热情。
    “幻灯公司”的每一场出演，总是吸引着挤得水泄不通的观众。在和顺县境内，从盛大的全县“百货大会”和“骡马大会”的会场上，一直到荒僻的深山小村里，大部分农民都看到了这里新兴的艺术。农民们从“幻灯公司”的放映里，得到了欢欣和快慰，也得到了教育和启示。“幻灯公司”已开始向盘据农村文化阵地的旧戏挑战，得到过可喜的胜利。在青城的庙会上，“幻灯公司”和旧戏剧碰头了。千百农民拥挤在幻灯的银幕前，而上演的旧戏却极少有人去看。
    这个“幻灯公司”的成长还只有短短的几个月。
    一九四九年春天，和顺县中共县委宣传部初次派人到前太行区文联美术部学习制作和放映幻灯。三月间，和顺县成立了人民文化馆，第二次派人去太行文联美术部学习。这次完全学会了制作灯箱，绘片和放映幻灯的技术。回来以后，经过短期的试验和练习，在农历四月十八日，和顺县的幻灯第一次和人民见面了。从此，它一步一步地成长壮实，由城关走到乡村，在千百万农民中间散布着它的影响。
    和顺县的幻灯影片，一开始就配合着当前中心工作，就地取材，因此它们永远有着新颖、丰富、生动而富于战斗性的内容。起初，“幻灯公司”根据文联美术部所拟定的内容，放映《太行区生产计划》、《负担政策》、《劳动英雄》、《改造懒汉》、《妇女锄苗》、《副业生产》、《组织起来》等等影片。在“抗灾生产”、“节约备荒”运动中，他们结合当地群众思想绘出了新片。以后又增加了《人民解放战争三年总结》、《女英雄刘胡兰》、新编故事《九件衣》等，到现在已有五百片左右，都是农民所喜闻乐见的题材。为了配合开展农村妇婴卫生工作，他们制作了新片《怎样养娃娃》。
    “幻灯公司”也把内阳村张二孩前年种麻时多上追肥，收获量大的故事，和东关干部发动农民上追肥的经验，搬上银幕，以推动农民在锄苗时上追肥。在积肥运动中，他们放映了沙峪村妇会主席割蒿积肥的故事。这些生动活泼的事例，对农民教育意义最大。农民们反应：看一次幻灯“比开会还开脑筋”，“比上民校听讲还强”；各区的干部，也经常要求到他们区里去放映。
    在群众的鼓舞下，和顺县的幻灯技术逐渐改进了。他们想办法把幻灯变成“有声幻灯”。用风琴配的飞机声，用大鼓配的炮声，以及火车声，汽车声，马车声，呐喊声，叹息声，……都配合着画面出现了。这样更加使场面逼真。每一次演出，观众都雅雀无声地注意着银幕上的活动。最近，和顺县又出现了“双层活动片”幻灯，在固定的画面上配合有活动的影像。这常使观众感到惊讶：“啊！不简单，狗跑过来了。”“快看，快看，放羊的也来了！”
    农民们对于幻灯，热忱地提出不少批评建议。起初，和顺县的幻灯片有的绘制粗糙。农民们提出意见了：“你们请上个好画匠，画的活眉活眼就更好看了。”有时，说明人解释得不清楚或灯光差一些，群众就要求“说得明白些！放得亮些！拉得稳些！”这些，促使着和顺的幻灯逐步改正缺点，技术日见精美。
    由于幻灯内容的不断改进，群众对它更加热爱。“幻灯公司”每到一村，就被大人小孩团团围住，要求多演几次。有时，放映幻灯的人路过一个村庄，被群众知道了，竟追出村三五里地拉回来，非留下演一夜不可。农民们把幻灯叫做“土电影”，有的叫做“汽影”（因为是用汽灯放映的）。放映幻灯的人，则被农民称呼为“幻灯公司”。其实这个“公司”，现在还仅仅有两个人和一副简单的装备，而他们的足迹却遍及和顺全境，他们的工作正影响着成千成万的农民，鼓舞着农民高涨着的生产热情。
