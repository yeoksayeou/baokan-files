　　"New Era" Condemns Acheson's Speech
    U.S. Aimed to Slander the Soviet Union to Cover Up Its Expansionist Conspiracy in Asia and the Failure of U.S. Policy Toward China
    Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, February 5th: TASS Moscow, February 2nd: The "New Era" magazine, in its international short commentary, commented on Acheson's recent statement regarding U.S. policy towards Asia, stating: "The purpose of this statement is to slander the Soviet Union in order to cover up the expansionist conspiracies of American imperialists in Asia and the failure of U.S. policy toward China." The magazine continued: More and more exposed actions demonstrate that the State Department is actively trying to keep the flames of war burning in Asia. Although Acheson remains silent on such facts, the facts themselves speak for themselves.
    The Kuomintang Central News Agency inadvertently revealed that Kuomintang representative Chen Zhiping, U.S. Ambassador to the Philippines, Cowen, and Philippine President Quirino recently held a secret meeting in Baguio, Philippines. According to the Central News Agency, the purpose of this tripartite meeting was to coordinate the military plans of the United States, the Philippines, and the Chiang Kai-shek group in the Far East, with strictly divided tasks. The Philippines' task is to transport weapons obtained from the United States to Taiwan and serve as a repository for the funds stolen by the Kuomintang, and is responsible for preparing to transport figures from the Chiang Kai-shek group to the Philippines.
    Prior to the Baguio meeting, Mr. Acheson had assured Kuomintang exiles that war materials would be shipped to Taiwan via the Philippines, and that eighty U.S. military advisors led by Crawford would be sent to Taiwan. Naturally, Mr. Acheson thought it unwise to mention this. He also did not say a word about the Caoshan meeting, although this meeting was held in strict compliance with the plan drawn up in Washington (presumably with the help of the Secretary of State). The Kuomintang leaders who attended the meeting unconditionally accepted Washington's orders, appointed Wu Guozhen as the chairman of Taiwan Province, divided the powers and functions between the central "government" and the provincial "government," and sent Kuomintang representatives to Japan to "study the issue of reinforcements." By the way, Japanese officers are being recruited to join the officer corps being organized in Taiwan. This recruitment is being conducted by Zhu Shiming, the head of the Kuomintang delegation in Tokyo. Japanese officers are transported to Taiwan via Hong Kong.
    The magazine stated: Mr. Acheson did not mention any of this. The reason for this silence is not difficult to understand. It is well known that he really has no legitimate reasons to justify the policy he continues to pursue in China, despite the complete failure of the Chiang Kai-shek group and the establishment of the People's Republic of China.

　　新时代斥艾奇逊演说
    美帝目的在于诽谤苏联以掩盖其在亚洲的扩张阴谋及美国对华政策的失败
    【新华社北京五日电】塔斯社莫斯科二日讯：新时代杂志在国际短评中评论艾奇逊最近所发表的关于美国对亚洲政策的声明称：“这个声明的目的，在于诽谤苏联，以掩盖美国帝国主义者在亚洲的扩张阴谋以及美国对华政策的失败。”该杂志继称：不断暴露出来的更多的行为说明，国务院正积极地设法使亚洲的战争火焰继续燃烧。艾奇逊虽对此等事实保持缄默，但事实本身足以说明一切。
    国民党中央通讯社不慎地透露：国民党代表陈质平、美国驻菲大使柯温及菲总统季里诺最近曾在菲律宾的碧瑶举行秘密会议。据中央社消息说：这个三方会议的目的，是使美国、菲律宾、蒋介石集团在远东的军事计划相互配合，任务被严格地划分。菲律宾的任务是从美国把所得到的武器运至台湾和充当国民党人偷窃来的资金的贮藏所，并负责筹备把蒋介石集团的人物运到菲律宾的事宜。
    在碧瑶会议之前，艾奇逊先生曾向国民党流亡者保证说：战争物资将经过菲律宾运至台湾，并且由克劳福率领的八十个美国军事顾问，将被派到台湾。自然，艾奇逊先生认为提到这件事是不聪明的。他对于草山会议也只字未提，虽然这次会议是严格遵守着在华盛顿（大概还是在国务卿的帮助下）厘订的计划举行的。参加此次会议的国民党首领们毫无保留地接受华盛顿的命令，任命吴国桢为台湾省主席，划分中央“政府”与省“政府”之间的职权，并派遣国民党代表到日本“研究援军问题”。顺便说一下，日本军官正被招募来参加正在台湾组织的军官队。这种招募工作由国民党驻东京代表团团长朱世明负责进行。日本军官们经过香港被运到台湾。
    该杂志称：艾奇逊先生对这一切只字未提。这种缄默的原由是不难理解的。众所周知：他实在没有任何的合理论据，来辩解他不顾蒋介石集团的完全失败和中华人民共和国的成立，仍在中国坚持执行的政策。
