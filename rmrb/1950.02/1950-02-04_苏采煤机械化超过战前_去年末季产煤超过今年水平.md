Xinhua News Agency, Moscow dispatch, 3rd: The Soviet Ministry of Coal Industry exceeded the 1950 coal production level stipulated in the Five-Year Plan in the fourth quarter of last year. During this period, coal production in the Donbas (the most important coal mining area in the Soviet Union) has exceeded the pre-war 1940 coal production level.

During the post-war Five-Year Plan period, all coal fields in the Donbas have been restored, and the mines have become more mechanized and more efficient than before the war. More than 600 million cubic meters of water have been extracted from the flooded Donbas coal mines. In the second quarter of 1949, 222 major mine shafts had been restored and had begun production; five million cubic meters of industrial buildings and various constructions had been repaired or rebuilt.

In terms of mechanization of coal mine production, significant achievements were made in 1949. The mechanization of coal cutting and tunneling in the mines under the Ministry of Coal Industry accounted for 98.5 percent, mine transportation accounted for 93.3 percent, truck transportation accounted for 91 percent, and train loading accounted for 98.5 percent. The mechanization of underground and surface work has exceeded pre-war levels. In the year ending August 1949 alone, more than 600 earth-moving machines, rock-loading machines, and coal-loading machines were working in the mines under the Ministry of Coal Industry, and the number of machines has increased several times compared with pre-war levels.

　　苏采煤机械化超过战前
     去年末季产煤超过今年水平
    【新华社北京三日电】塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏联煤业部于去年第四季已超过五年计划所规定的一九五零年产煤水平。在这一期间，顿巴斯（苏联最重要的煤矿区）煤产已超过战前一九四零年的煤产水平。
    在战后五年计划时期中，顿巴斯所有的煤田都已恢复，矿坑已更加机械化，效率也已超过战前。从水淹的顿巴斯煤矿里，已抽出了六亿余立方公尺的水。在一九四九年的第二季，二百二十二个主要的矿坑已经恢复，并已开始生产；五百万立方公尺的工业建筑与各种建筑，业已修复或重建。
    在煤矿生产的机械化方面，一九四九年获得了重大的成就，在煤业部所属矿坑里切煤与掘煤的机械化，占百分之九十八点五，矿坑输送占百分之九十三点三，货车运输占百分之九十一，火车装煤占百分之九十八点五。地下与地上工作的机械化已超过战前水平。仅在一九四九年八月为止的一年中，在煤业部所属的矿坑中，已有六百余架装土机、装石机和装煤机从事工作，机器的数量已较战前增加了数倍。
