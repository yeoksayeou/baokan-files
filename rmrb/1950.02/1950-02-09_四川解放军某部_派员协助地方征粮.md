A Certain Unit of the People's Liberation Army in Sichuan
Sends Personnel to Assist Local Grain Collection

[This Newspaper’s Dispatch] A certain unit, such as Unit XX, of the People's Liberation Army stationed in a certain area of Sichuan, responding to Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu's call that "the fighting force is also a working force," recently dispatched a large number of cadres and soldiers to the countryside to assist the government in grain collection work. More than 300 people from a certain unit participated in the grain collection work, divided into three squadrons, which went to the countryside on the 15th of last month. Before departure, the team held a send-off meeting. The leaders repeatedly explained that going to the countryside to help the government collect grain was to solve the current financial and economic difficulties and consolidate the fruits of the revolutionary victory. They encouraged everyone to stand firm, vigorously publicize the policies of the people's government, deeply mobilize the masses, unite as one, obey the leadership of the higher authorities, take the initiative to unite with government personnel at all levels, and learn from them with an open mind. The grain collection work team composed of more than 650 people from a certain unit also went to the countryside on the 11th of last month. In order to successfully complete the task, each unit conducted nearly a week of policy study before departure based on the instructions of the government and superiors, implemented the education of "the fighting force is also a working force," and overcame the shrinking thoughts of a few people who feared hardship. Director Zhong of the political department of the unit encouraged all personnel to continue to carry forward the glorious tradition of hard work and plain living of the People's Liberation Army in performing their tasks, abide by discipline, master policies, implement all decrees of the local government, strive to be models, and complete the collection task. The political department of the unit also called on all subordinate organs and troops to conduct in-depth publicity among the masses in the駐地 area, resolutely smash the enemy's rumors and sabotage, and actively assist in grain collection, help with transportation and warehouse management. Sichuan comrades in the army should write letters to persuade their families to pay public grain voluntarily. If the family is poor and unable to afford it, they can assist the government in promoting grain raising work. Revolutionary armymen's families should become models in implementing the policies and decrees of the people's government, so as to lead the masses in paying grain.

　　四川解放军某部
    派员协助地方征粮
    【本报讯】驻四川某地的人民解放军某某等部，响应毛主席、朱总司令“战斗队又是工作队”的号召，近抽调大批干部战士下乡，协助政府进行征粮工作。某部参加征粮工作的有三百余人，分成三个中队，已于上月十五日下乡。临行前该队举行欢送大会，首长一再说明下乡帮助政府征粮，是为了解决当前的财经困难，巩固革命胜利成果。勉励大家要站稳立场，大力宣传人民政府政策，深入发动群众，并团结一致，服从上级领导，主动团结各级政府人员，虚心向他们学习。某部组成的征粮工作队共六百五十余人，亦于上月十一日分别下乡。为了胜利完成任务，各单位于出发前均根据政府与上级的指示，进行了将近一周的政策学习，贯彻“战斗队又是工作队”的教育，克服少数人员怕艰苦的退缩思想。该部政治部钟主任勉励全体人员在执行任务中，继续发扬解放军艰苦朴素的光荣传统，遵守纪律，掌握政策，执行地方政府的一切法令，争取模范，完成征收任务。该部政治部并号召所属各机关部队，对驻地群众展开深入宣传，坚决粉碎敌人的造谣破坏，积极主动协助征粮，帮助运输及看管仓库工作。部队中的四川籍同志，应写信劝说自己家属自动缴纳公粮，如家庭贫苦无力负担者，可协助政府推动筹粮工作。革命军人家属应成为执行人民政府的政策法令的模范，以带领群众缴粮。
