Soviet film art is the most advanced art in the world, and it carries out the lofty task of educating workers in the spirit of the great teachings of Lenin and Stalin. Soviet films truly belong to the people, possess a high degree of ideological content, and are profoundly realistic. They reflect the most important themes of socialist construction and the concerns of the people, displaying the Soviet people's unparalleled labor achievements and glorious, devoted struggles in striving for communism.

Lenin and Stalin repeatedly emphasized the great significance of film art in the cause of educating the masses.

In 1935, on the fifteenth anniversary of Soviet cinema, Comrade Stalin wrote: "In the hands of the Soviet regime, film represents a great and valuable force. It possesses a special possibility of influencing the spirit of the masses, it can assist the working class and its party to educate the working people in a socialist spirit, organize the masses to engage in the struggle for socialism, and raise their cultural and political combat effectiveness."

The Party and the government have consistently been concerned with all aspects of the development of Soviet film art, and with improving the ideological and artistic quality of Soviet films. The historical resolution of the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) on ideological issues defined a new stage in the development of Soviet cinema and opened up new paths for its growth.

Soviet filmmakers have responded to the Party's concern with the creation of many outstanding films. For example, the excellent biographical film "Lenin," and films with high artistic achievements such as "Michurin," "The Young Guard," "The Story of a Real Man," "The Third Blow," "The Court of Honor," "Academician Pavlov," "The Distant Bride," etc., have all been embraced by audiences. In these films, the glorious victory of the heroic Soviet army, the great strength of Soviet patriotism, and their boundless love and loyalty to the Lenin-Stalin Party and the magnificent socialist motherland are clearly and convincingly expressed.

However, Soviet filmmakers still bear many tasks before the people. Because until now, mediocre and bad films still appear on the screen, such as those substandard films produced by the Soviet Ministry of Film in 1948: "The Train Goes East," "The Golden Horn," "Daughter of Fergana," etc. The appearance of these films proves that filmmakers have not done enough in fulfilling the tasks before them, and they have not yet made every film produced reach a high level of ideological and artistic quality.

Cosmopolitans active in the Soviet film industry and opponents of Soviet realist art similar to them have brought much harm to our films. They slander Soviet films, maliciously criticize the achievements of Soviet films, and praise decadent bourgeois films.

The anti-patriotic group that had built a nest for itself within the film ministry organization has been exposed. Cosmopolitans with no family or roots should be thoroughly crushed, and any attempts to hinder the improvement and development of Soviet cinema should be further cut off.

Soviet filmmakers should unremittingly improve the ideological and artistic level of their films, while striving to ensure that each film can penetrate into the broadest strata of the working people in our country.

It should be remembered that even the best films cannot achieve the desired educational effect if they are not practically and systematically brought to the masses. Every Soviet film must be made the property of the broad masses of the people in the country. This means that every Soviet film should be shown in every region of our country in a timely manner.

Unfortunately, the facts show that many cinemas and mobile film projection equipment are still far from meeting the needs of the audience. At the same time, not all cinemas have been renovated, some film projection technology is still backward, and the projection conditions and sound are not good. This situation is a major obstacle to the further development of rural film facilities and attracting audiences to cinemas. There are still many Party and Soviet organs that do not attach importance to this important cause, they lack strong leadership over film organs, and they do not regularly supervise their work.

In the years since the war, enormous work has been done in restoring and expanding film equipment and rectifying regular rural film facilities.

In terms of the number of film venues, the state film network has exceeded the pre-war level by forty-two percent. In the Moscow Oblast and Sverdlovsk Oblast, and in the republics of Lithuania, Moldova, Latvia, Tajikistan, and Estonia, the film network has grown particularly significantly.

Now, film has penetrated into the most remote corners of our country, it promotes the political and cultural development of the Soviet people, and cultivates in them a feeling of pride in their great motherland.

The Moscow Oblast has achieved great success in film facilities, it already has one thousand five hundred film venues. Films are regularly screened in most collective farms. In this oblast, forty-four film projector supply stations have been opened; therefore, almost all substandard film equipment has been eliminated. All these methods ensure that the implementation of urban and rural film facilities exceeds the plan.

However, what has been done to improve rural film facilities is still far from enough. In many republics and oblasts, there are still many shortcomings in this matter.

The most fundamental condition for thoroughly improving rural film facilities is the leadership of the local Party organizations over the film organs. It is believed that where the Party's oblast committees and district committees are concerned and help, rural film facilities will continue to improve. That is why attention should be paid to the working experience of the Moscow Oblast and Rostov Oblast committees of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks). Not long ago, these Party oblast committees comprehensively inspected the work of film organs, cinemas, and mobile films, and at the same time planned to guarantee concrete plans for important improvements in rural film facilities.

Local Party organizations should systematically lead film organs, help improve rural film facilities, and should remember that film is an important method for carrying out communist education for the workers.

　　苏联电影是教育人民的有力工具
    刘竞译
    苏维埃电影艺术是世界上最先进的艺术，它执行着，以列宁—斯大林伟大学说的精神来教育劳动者的崇高任务。苏维埃电影是真正属于人民的，它具有高度的思想性，是深刻的现实主义的，它反映出社会主义建设的最重要的和人民最关切的主题，显示出苏维埃人民为争取共产主义无比的劳动功绩及光荣的、献身的斗争。
    列宁和斯大林都曾屡次地强调过，电影艺术在教育群众的事业中是有着巨大意义的。
    在一九三五年苏维埃电影十五周年时，斯大林同志曾写道：“电影在苏维埃政权手中，表现着一种巨大而珍贵的力量。它具有对群众精神影响的特殊可能性，它可以协助工人阶级及其政党以社会主义精神教育劳动人民，组织群众从事争取社会主义的斗争，提高他们的文化和政治战斗力。”
    党和政府始终不渝地关切着苏维埃电影艺术的各方面的发展，关切着提高苏维埃影片的思想艺术的品质。联共（布）中央委员会关于思想意识问题的具有历史性的决议，确定了苏维埃电影发展的新阶段，给它的成长开辟了新的道路。
    苏维埃电影艺术家，以很多卓越影片的创作回答了党的关切。如出色的传记片《列宁》，及具有高度艺术成就的影片《米秋林》、《青年近卫军》、《真实人的故事》、《第三次攻击》、《光荣的裁判》、《科学院会员巴甫洛夫》、《远方的未婚妻》等等，都获得观众的拥护。在这些影片中，明显地与使人确信地表示出英勇的苏维埃军队的光荣胜利，苏维埃人民爱国主义的伟大力量，以及他们对列宁——斯大林党与雄伟的社会主义祖国的无限热爱和忠诚。
    但是，苏维埃电影工作者，在人民的前面仍负有很多的任务。因为到现在，平庸和不好的影片仍出现在银幕上。如在一九四八年苏联电影部制出的那些不够标准的影片：《列车东去》、《金色的号角》、《菲尔干的女儿》等等。这些影片的出现，证明了电影工作者在完成他们面前的任务时，做的还很不够，他们还没有使每一部制出的影片都具有高度的思想和艺术的水平。
    活动在苏维埃电影界的世界主义者们及类似他们的苏维埃现实主义艺术的反对者们，给我们的电影带来了许多损害。他们诽谤苏维埃电影，恶意批评苏维埃电影的成就，赞美资产阶级的堕落电影。
    在电影部组织内曾为自己筑了巢穴的反爱国主义集团，已被揭露出来。应当彻底粉碎孤寡无亲的世界主义者，进一步切断阻挠苏维埃电影提高和发展的一切企图。
    苏维埃电影工作者应该不屈不挠地提高影片的思想和艺术的水平，同时努力使每一部影片都能深入到我们国家最广大的劳动人民阶层中去。
    应当记住：如果最优秀的影片不实际地有组织地深入到群众中去，那么，它也就不能够达到应有的教育效果。必需使每一个苏维埃影片成为国内广大人民的财产。这就是说：每部苏维埃影片都应适时地在我国每一个地区里放映。
    可惜，事实却说明了许多电影院和巡回放映电影的设备，还非常不能满足观众的要求。同时并不是一切影院都已修缮好了，一部分电影放映技术仍然是低下的，放映的条件与声音也不好。这种情况对乡村电影设施的进一步发展和吸引观众到电影院来是一个重要的障碍。仍有许多党和苏维埃的机关不重视这件重要的事业，他们对电影机关领导不强，同时也没有经常监督他们的工作。
    战后几年来，在复兴和开拓电影设备方面及整顿正规的乡村电影设施上，都进行了庞大的工作。
    就电影场的数量说，国家电影网已超过战前水平的百分之四十二。在莫斯科州和司维尔罗夫州，在立陶宛，摩尔达维亚，拉脱维亚，塔吉克和爱沙尼亚等共和国的电影网特殊显著的增长起来。
    现在，电影已渗入了我国最辽远的角落去了，它促进苏维埃人民的政治与文化的发展，培养他们爱自己伟大祖国的骄傲感情。
    莫斯科州在电影设施方面获得了伟大成就，它已具有一千五百个电影场。在大多数的集体农场中，都正规地放映电影。在这一州里，开设了四十四个电影机补给站；因此，几乎全部排除了低陋的电影设备。所有这些方法保证了城市和乡村电影设施的执行超过了计划。
    但是，在改善乡村电影设施方面所做的仍然很不够。在许多共和国和州中，关于这件事仍存在着不少的缺点。
    彻底改善乡村电影设施最基本的条件，是地方党的组织对电影机关的领导工作。相信，那里能得到党的州委会及区委会的关心和帮助，那里就会不断地改进乡村电影设施。这就是为什么应注意莫斯科州与罗斯托夫州联共（布）州委会工作经验。不久以前，这些党的州委会全面地检查电影机关、影院和巡回电影的工作，同时计划保证重要的改善乡村电影设施的具体方案。
    地方党组织应有步骤地领导电影机关，帮助改善乡村电影设施，应当记着：电影是对劳动者进行共产主义教育的重要方法。
