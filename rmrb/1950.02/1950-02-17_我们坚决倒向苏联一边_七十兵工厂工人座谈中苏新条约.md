　　We Resolutely Lean to the Soviet Side
    ——Workers of the 70th Ordnance Factory Discuss the New Sino-Soviet Treaty
    Chen Ji
    The news that the Chinese and Soviet governments had concluded a treaty of friendship, alliance and mutual assistance reached the 70th Ordnance Factory, and all the workers held a celebration meeting. After the secretary of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association's 70th Ordnance Factory branch reported on the content of the treaty, shouts of "Long live Sino-Soviet friendship and cooperation!" and "Long live the solidarity of the Chinese and Soviet people!" echoed through the venue. Lu Mao, an old worker who had participated in the "February 7th" strike, said with joy and excitement: "Comrades! We must properly celebrate the signing of the new Sino-Soviet treaty."
    At the discussion, Hu Hualiang stated that the Soviet loan to China and the signing of the new agreement with China, "is the most sublime friendship in humanity and a great spirit of internationalism, which we will never forget." Workers living in Beijing recalled the brutal acts of oppression against China by American imperialism, saying: At that time, American soldiers could arbitrarily rape Chinese women, and could casually run over Chinese people with jeeps, but they shamelessly said they were "helping" the Chinese people. Wu Xixian said: "Chairman Mao is leading us to 'lean to one side,' and this time we see it even more clearly. The Soviet Union is a country of working people and is completely different from imperialism. Her help to us is sincere. For example, this agreement, which lends us 300 million US dollars, requires only one percent annual interest. She knows that we have difficulties in industrial construction, so she helps us solve those difficulties. This is the true color of a socialist country.” As soon as Wu Xixian finished speaking, everyone shouted in unison: "We must take the Soviet road, we must overthrow imperialism!"
    Old miner Bai Baochun spoke of working for the Japanese, being locked in the coal mine all day long, not seeing the sun for seven years, only seeing whips and wooden sticks. Everyone was reminded of the cruel atrocities of the Japanese invaders, American imperialists, and Kuomintang bandits a few years ago. They said: We fought for decades and shed the blood of millions upon millions, in order to drive out the enemies who oppressed us. Today we have won. Liu Shijie then shouted: "Today we have the Soviet Union, we have the close cooperation of 700 million people, we are united as steel, and the imperialists will be terrified. The people of the world will surely win, and will always win."
    When the workers saw the content of the Sino-Soviet treaty, it naturally made them think of the treaties that China had signed with foreign countries in the past. Li Shijiu cited the "Sino-American Commercial Treaty" as an example to illustrate the crimes of American imperialism in infringing upon China. The American government talked about Sino-American "friendship" but in reality it was seizing China's inland navigation rights, the right to station troops, and the right to develop Chinese mines, and so on. The so-called "friendship" of the United States toward China was to colonize China and turn it into the Philippines. But the Chinese people have won, and the Chinese people have defeated the reactionary forces of imperialism in China, and have recovered the special rights of imperialism in China. For example, our recent recovery of the land of the foreign barracks in Beijing is one example. Today we have signed the most friendly, mutually assisting and most equal treaty in Chinese history with the great Soviet Union, which illustrates the greatness of the Soviet Union's foreign policy. After listening to Li Shijiu's words, Bai Shou excitedly called on everyone: "We must thank the Soviet Union, thank the Soviet Union for unconditionally transferring the property acquired from the Japanese aggressors in the Northeast, and thank the Soviet Union for the correct attitude taken towards the Chinese Changchun Railway, Lushun and Dalian."
    During the discussion, they also proposed specific ways to celebrate the new Sino-Soviet treaty. All the workers present unanimously expressed that they would properly discuss this year's production tasks, formulate this year's monthly production plans, and ensure the completion of the plans. Li Shijiu said: "We must learn from the Soviet Union, we must learn from the Soviet workers, we must not waste the economic loans given to us by the Soviet Union, and we must use them to build a better new China."

　　我们坚决倒向苏联一边
    ——七十兵工厂工人座谈中苏新条约
    陈迹
    中苏两国政府缔结友好同盟互助条约的消息传到七十兵工厂，全厂工人召开了庆祝会。中苏友好协会七十兵工厂支会干事报告条约内容后，“中苏友好合作万岁！”“中苏人民团结万岁！”的呼声震荡会场。参加过“二七”大罢工的老工人路懋带着喜悦的心情，兴奋地说：“同志们！我们要好好庆祝中苏新条约的签定。”
    座谈会上，胡化良认为苏联贷款给中国和中国签订新协定，“是人类最崇高的友谊，是伟大的国际主义精神，我们是永远不会忘记的。”生活在北京的工人们回忆美帝国主义压迫中国的残暴行为说：那时，美国兵可以任意强奸中国妇女，可以随便以吉普车轧死中国老百姓，但是他们还厚颜无耻地说“帮助”中国人民。吴希贤说：“毛主席领导我们‘一面倒’，这次看的更清楚了。苏联是劳动人民的国家，和帝国主义完全是两回事。她帮助我们是真心真意的。比如这次协定，借给我们三亿美金，仅要年利百分之一。她知道我们工业建设有困难，就帮助我们解决困难，这是社会主义国家的本色。”吴希贤的话刚刚讲完，大家齐声喊道：“我们要走苏联的路，我们要打倒帝国主义！”
    老矿工白宝纯说到给日本做工时，一天到晚被关在煤窑里，七个年头没有看见太阳，看见的是皮鞭、木棍。大家听了都想起了几年前日寇、美帝国主义和国民党匪帮的残忍暴行。他们说：我们打了几十年的仗，流了千千万万人的血，为的是赶走压迫我们的敌人，今天我们是胜利了。刘式杰接着高喊道：“今天我们有了苏联，我们有了七万万人民的亲密合作，我们团结如钢铁，帝国主义者就会心惊胆战。全世界人民一定会胜利，永远要胜利。”
    当工人们看到中苏条约的内容时，自然地使他们想到往年中国和外国签订的条约。李世久举出《中美商约》为例说明美帝国主义侵害中国的罪行，美国政府口口声声谈中美《友谊》，实际是夺取中国内河航行权、驻兵权和开发中国矿山权等等。所谓美国对中国的“友谊”，就是把中国殖民地化，变成菲律宾。但是中国人民胜利了，中国人民打败了帝国主义在中国的反动势力，收回了帝国主义在中国的特权，比如我们最近收回北京外国兵营地产就是一例。今天我们和伟大苏联签订了中国历史上最友好互助和最平等的条约，这说明了苏联外交政策的伟大。白寿听了李世久这些话之后，激动地号召大家：“我们要感谢苏联，感谢苏联无偿地移交在东北从日本侵略者手中获得的财产，感谢苏联对于中长路、旅顺和大连所采取的正确态度。”
    他们在座谈中，还提出庆祝中苏新条约的具体办法，所有在场的工人们都一致表示：要好好讨论今年生产任务，拟定今年每月的生产计划，保证计划完成。李世久说道：“我们要向苏联看齐，我们要学习苏联工人，我们要不浪费苏联给我们的经济贷款，我们要用它来把新中国建设好。”
