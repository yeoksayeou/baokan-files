The Development of Soviet Fishery
    ——Interview with Soviet Food Industry Expert
    Bai Sheng

At the first National Fishery Conference, a Soviet food industry expert introduced us to the development of Soviet fishery. There are many valuable experiences in the construction of fishery in a socialist country that are worth learning from.

    (1) The Backward Fishery Situation in the Tsarist Era

Although the Soviet Union has achieved an important position in the world's fishing industry today, looking back at the Tsarist era, the Soviet fishery was extremely backward. In Tsarist Russia under landlords and capitalists, there was no real food industry at all, and of course, there was no fishing industry. It was an economically backward country. Agricultural production was semi-natural, and the living standards of the working people were very low. Food was produced in small-scale, handicraft-style, backward factories or in households. Therefore, the fishing industry was also manufactured by small, backward factories.

Before the October Revolution in Russia, due to the rudimentary fishing industry, only fishing work near the coast and rivers could be carried out, because it was impossible to control large sea areas and there were no fishing tools, so only small fish that came out to bask in the sun could be caught. In the northern and Far Eastern regions of the Soviet Union, the oceans had abundant fishing grounds, but they were not utilized in the Tsarist era, because at that time, Japanese fishing industrialists were actually the masters of the waters in the Far East, and they stole fish in the Far Eastern waters for a long time.

Thirty years ago, the Soviet Union had almost no joint fish processing plants, canning factories, refrigerated ships, refrigerated trucks, etc. At that time, the types of fish products processed were also extremely limited. The only thing supplied to the people was salted products. At that time, the fishing industry equipment was extremely simple. There were no processing and refrigeration factories. The best it could do was to put them in barrels, which caused great losses to the harvested fish. On the other hand, there were no scientific research institutions engaged in fish breeding and protection.

Although, according to the number of fish inhabiting the sea and rivers, the Soviet Union ranked first in the world, with more than 300 species of fish, of which more than 180 species were edible, and many of them were valuable species. However, because of the backwardness of the fishery in the Tsarist era, the country was unable to use this vast fishery resource to serve the people. Even with so much fish storage, the Soviet Union used to import a lot of fish from foreign countries every year.

    (2) Construction of the Soviet Fishing Industry

If there had been no great October Socialist Revolution, and the working class and peasants of the Soviet Union had not seized power, then the food industry in the Soviet Union would still be backward today, and the fishery would naturally not have been developed. The Soviet territorial waters would still be occupied by some robber-style fishing. But the great October Socialist Revolution eliminated the landlord regime and changed Russia from backwardness to prosperity.

During the years of the Soviet Five-Year Plans, the Soviet people began to build huge industries. Under such rapid development in the Soviet Union, the supply of food to the working people could no longer rely on the backward food industry of the past. Therefore, in order to cooperate with the development of the various departments of the Soviet people's economy, the Soviet Union implemented the establishment of a national food industry organization. The industrialization of the country has also provided the fishing industry with new equipment. The Soviet Union began to build powerful machine fishing boats, construct many new refrigeration enterprises, and build large-scale fish product joint factories and fish product canning factories. During these years, the Soviet Union created a strong fishing fleet, with 7,000 mechanized motor boats and more than 100 large motor boats, and thousands of small fishing boats. On the basis of modern technology with huge production capacity, the Soviet Union has built the largest fish product and fish processing and storage enterprises, such as the Caspian Sea and the northern regions' fishing factories. In addition, 35 canning factories, 26 refrigeration factories, and 28 fish oil factories were established. At present, the Soviet fishing industry is equipped with the latest automated fish loading tools, as well as mechanically processed heating furnaces. The use of glass packaging materials has also begun to be widespread. These tasks not only built new fisheries, but also expanded old fishery factories, packaging factories, shipbuilding factories, and fish vessel repair factories.

Today, the Soviet fishery has obtained a widespread radio communication network and uses aircraft to detect the migration routes of fish in the water. At the same time, the Soviet fishery industry workers base their work on the biological research of the Academy of Sciences and the Institute for fishing work. In addition, fishery colleges and secondary specialized schools were established in Moscow and other places to train cadres. The fishing industry also formulated fishing rules and the system for using water areas.

    (3) Soviet Fishery Organization and Management System

In the Soviet Union, the People's Supply Committee was initially established, specializing in the management of food industry and trade issues. Among them, the All-Soviet Fishery Industry Union was established, specializing in the management of fishery industry development issues. Later, the People's Supply Committee specifically established the People's Food Industry Committee and the People's Trade Committee. Therefore, within the Food Committee, the General Administration of Fishery Industry Management was established to manage fishery development issues.

Due to the rapid development of the Soviet national economy, the food industry has further developed. According to the government's decision, the People's Food Committee was divided into three departments: the Soviet Union Food Industry Department, the Fishery Industry Department, and the Meat and Dairy Industry Department. From here, we can see the Soviet government's emphasis on fishery. In the Soviet Union Fishery Industry Department, there is one minister and five deputy ministers in charge of business. The minister is appointed by the government and is directly supervised by the government to carry out all work and promote the correct development of the fishery industry. The Minister is responsible for the overall leadership, instructing and supervising the work of all departments of the national fishery industry. He also directly leads the most important and decisive work. The Deputy Minister specifically guides, supervises, inspects, instructs a certain department's work, such as basic construction projects, material and technical supply, shipbuilding work, fish harvesting and processing, finished product sales, cadre work, etc. The Soviet Union Fishery Industry Department has a central agency, which executes its work according to the organizational system and work regulations of the department. According to the department's tasks, it consists of the following divisions: Economic Planning Division, Finance Division, Accounting Division, Labor and Wage Division, Technology Division, Basic Construction Project Division, Trade Division, Cadre Division, Mechanical Equipment and Power Division, Fuel Division, Administrative Management Division, Inspection Division, Secretariat, etc. In addition to these departments, there are also several general administrations, such as the Eastern Region Fishery Management General Administration, the Western Region Fishery Management General Administration, the Fishery Industry Shipbuilding Management Bureau, the Fishery Industry Basic Construction Project Management Bureau, the Fishery Industry Material and Technical Supply Management Bureau, the Fishery Industry Finished Product Trade Management Bureau, the Fishery Industry Packaging Material Management Bureau, the All-Soviet Fishery Combination Union Management Bureau, the Fishery Breeding Protection Management General Administration, etc. All kinds of organizations and factories in the fishery industry either directly belong to or, through local combined unions, belong to the Fishery Industry Department and the Fishery Industry Management General Administration. In the areas with the most fish production, fishery industry combinations are formed, such as the Black Sea Fishery Combination, the Northern Region Fishery Combination, the Siberian Fishery Combination, etc. In addition to these, almost every Soviet Union Republic has its own Fishery Industry Department or Fishery Industry Management General Administration, specializing in managing the development of their local fishery production. The fishery agency organizations in these republics are the same as the All-Soviet General Administration, but on a smaller scale. The Fishery Industry Department, the Fishery Industry Management General Administration, and the Fishery Combination, with respect to the approved fishery industry financial plan, become a law for all places to obey. This plan must always be very tense, calling for progress, and fully utilizing all material and human resources. The Soviet people have educated a best tradition, that is, although the highest plan is prescribed, they always consider it the lowest. The Soviet Five-Year Plan is never completed in five years. For example, the five-year fishing work plan was completed in four years. In 1949, fishing work exceeded the task by 122%. The Fishery Industry Department, the Fishery Management General Administration, and the Fishery Combination mobilized all forces, and all fishermen worked hard to exceed this plan.

The Fishery Industry Department, the Fishery Industry Management General Administration, and the Fishery Combination must systematically inspect work, correct and eliminate shortcomings in work, ensure the supply of materials, and provide necessary assistance to various enterprises. All fishery agencies must also properly count all materials, fishing gear, finished products, equipment, fishermen's strength, technology, etc. The Fishery Industry Department and the Fishery Industry Management General Administration must further formulate plans and take all measures to develop fishery work according to the actual situation, and the government also provides assistance. Every year, the government will pass a resolution on the preparation work for the spring fishing season of the fishery industry to ensure the implementation of the plan. Every year, the Fishery Industry Department convenes a fishery conference and a fishery industry economic planning conference, with administrative, production technology planning workers, and Stakhanovite workers from various enterprises participating to discuss, study, and summarize past work and specifically formulate future production plans.

    (4) Current Situation of the Soviet Fishery

During the Soviet-German War, the Soviet national economy suffered great losses, and the fishery industry was of course no exception. In this war, the Soviet Union lost many fishery factories, ships, and sacrificed many cadres. However, the Soviet people quickly invested in the restoration and construction of the fishery after the war. The Soviet Union carried out the restoration struggle simultaneously during the liberation war. The law on the Soviet People's Economic Restoration Plan from 1946 to 1950 required the rapid restoration of all departments of the food industry, including the fishery industry. In the fishery industry sector, it was required to restore pre-war varieties and improve quality. In 1950, fishery processed products were required to exceed one and a half times the pre-war level, fresh and frozen products were to increase by 1.8 times, and fish paste was to increase by three times. The development of fishery in the northern and Far Eastern regions was also to be widely promoted. Restoring fishery was to exceed the pre-war level, during which 150 large ships were to be dispatched; 13 large fishery canning factories and 30 refrigeration factories were to be built. In order to implement the Soviet People's Economic Restoration and Development Plan from 1946 to 1950, Soviet fishery workers mobilized all labor and materials, the organizational and management experience of all engineering and technical personnel, Stakhanovite workers, and shock workers, and utilized all achievements. Due to the production enthusiasm of the Soviet working people, fishing work has been completed in four years. Now the Soviet Union can obtain at least ten kilograms of fish per person per year. Calculated in this way, the Soviet fishery has not only exceeded the pre-war level, but has also exceeded it by one and a half times.

Regarding the situation of the Soviet fishery industry in various regions, the Far Eastern region has the largest fish storage in terms of fishing work quantity, but it has not yet been fully developed. There are many kinds of fish products, such as flounder, cod, and mackerel. Secondly, the Caspian region of the Soviet Union ranks second, including the Volga River, the Ural River, the Kura River, and the Terekkum River. The main fish here are mackerel and salmon. The third is the Murmansk River area in northern Soviet Union, where there are mainly cod and herring. These regions are mechanized in fishing, and fishing work is carried out throughout the year. Fourth is the Black Sea region, including the Don River, the Kuban River, the Dnieper River, the Southern Bug River, and the lower reaches of the Danube River. Fifth is the Baltic Sea, where the number of fish products is relatively small. In addition, the fish production in lakes and ponds is also very rich. At the same time, the Soviet Union has also rapidly developed collective fishery labor production and built artificial ponds to raise mirror carp. The fishery labor production of collective farms is to supply fresh and frozen fish products to the workers in the industrial center areas nearby.

In order to adapt to lake and pond fish farming and artificial pond farming of high-quality fish species, the Soviet Union has widely started using artificial breeding methods to cultivate a large number of fish fry and transport them to various fish farming areas by airplane. At present, the Soviet Union also sends special fleets to Antarctica every year to catch whales and produce whale oil. This is very useful in medicine or soap making. In addition, fleets are also sent to the Greenland region to carry out work. In the Soviet Union, the proportion of fishing has been increasing year by year, and state-owned fishing work has moved from a leading position to a completely controlling position. However, this does not mean that the fishing work of collective fishing farms has decreased. In fact, it has increased, but its proportion of the total production is not large. Moreover, the Soviet government provides great assistance to the fishermen of collective fishing farms, providing them with ships and fishing gear, and helping them improve quality.

In the Soviet Union, modern fishery finished products are processed according to scientific methods. There is a laboratory in every factory to supervise raw materials and the production process. In the Soviet fishery factories, there are inspectors sent by the state to be responsible for inspecting and supervising the finished products. Everything must comply with the standards, otherwise the products cannot be shipped out. At the same time, many measures have been taken to implement hygiene and cleanliness. All fishery enterprises and factories must meet the conditions of hygiene and cleanliness. In recent years, the Soviet Union's fish processing finished products have been relatively reduced, because it is necessary to promote a large number of frozen live fish to supply people for food, but the manufacture of dried fish, such as pickled herring, is still expanding.

In the Soviet Union, currently in state-owned factories, fishery workers are paid according to their work, and wages are paid on a progressive basis for exceeding quotas. In addition to one day off per week, workers also have two weeks of vacation a year, with wages paid as usual. Dormitories, first-aid stations, clinics, sanatoriums, summer resorts, as well as schools, hospitals, nurseries, clubs and other agencies have been established for employees. Social insurance work and cultural and political education work for workers in public factories have been actively carried out. Every year, fishery workers also launch high-level production competitions, which has enabled the five-year plan of the fishery of the entire Soviet state-owned enterprise to be overfulfilled ahead of schedule.

　　苏联渔业的发展
    ——苏联食品工业专家谈话
    柏生
    在首届全国渔业会议中，一位苏联食品工业专家为我们介绍了苏联渔业发展的情况，这里有许多关于社会主义国家渔业建设的宝贵经验是值得我们学习的。
    （一）沙皇时代落后的渔业情况
    虽然今天苏联已经获得了世界渔捞工作的重要地位，但回想在帝俄时代，苏联的渔业仍是极其落后的。在沙皇时代地主资本家的俄国，根本没有过真正的食品工业，当然也就没有渔业工业。那是一个经济上落后的国家。农业生产是半自然式的，劳动人民的生活水平很低。食品都是在一些小规模的、手工业式的、落后工厂中或家庭生产中制造的。因此渔业工业也是由小型的落后工厂制造。
    在十月革命前的俄国，由于渔业工业简陋，只能进行靠近海岸与河里的渔捞工作，因为无法控制大的海面，又没有渔捞工具，只有把出来晒太阳的小鱼捞来。在苏联北部和远东地区海洋，那样丰富的渔场，但在帝俄时代却没有利用，因为那时在远东的海水中实际上是日本渔业工业家做了主人，他们很长时期以偷窃的方式在远东的海水中捞着鱼。
    三十年以前的苏联几乎没有渔品加工联合工厂、罐头工厂、冷藏船、冷藏货车等，那时渔品加工种类也是极有限的，供给人民吃的也仅是咸的盐制品，那时渔业工业设备极其简陋，没有加工和冷藏工厂，最好的只不过是装在桶内，因此使捞获的鱼类受到很大的损失。在另外一方面，也没有科学研究机关从事鱼类的繁殖和保护工作。
    虽然根据海、河中，鱼的栖息数量上来说，苏联是占世界第一位，鱼的种类有三百种以上，可供食用的也有一百八十余种，里面更有许多贵重的品种。然而因为沙皇时代渔业的落后性，国家没有能把这广大的渔业资源用来为人民服务。即使有这样多的鱼藏量，但过去苏联每年还要从外国输入很多的鱼类。
    （二）苏联渔业工业的建设
    假使没有伟大的十月社会主义革命，苏联的工人阶级和农民没有把政权掌握在手里，那么今天苏联的食品工业还会是落后的，渔业自然也得不到发展，在苏联领海内仍会被一些强盗式的鱼捞占据着。但伟大的十月社会主义革命，消灭了地主政权，把俄国由落后变为富强。
    在苏联五年计划这些年月里，苏联人民开始建设了巨大的工业。苏联国家在这样急骤的发展下，对劳动人民食品的供给，自然不能再依靠过去落后的食品工业来完成了，所以为了配合苏联人民经济各部门的发展，在苏联实行了建立全国的食品工业机构。国家的工业化，使渔业工业也有了新式的设备。苏联开始建立了强大马力的机器渔船，建设很多的新冷藏企业，建设了大型的鱼品联合工厂和鱼品罐头工厂。在这些年月里，苏联创立了坚强的渔业航队，有七千只有机械牵引的机船和一百个以上的大机船，几千个小型的渔船。在具有巨大生产能力的近代技术基础上，苏联已建设了最大的鱼品和鱼类加工与收藏企业，像卡斯宾海和北部地区的渔业工厂。此外还建立了三十五个罐头工厂、二十六个冷藏工厂、二十八个制造鱼油的工厂。目前苏联渔业工业装备了最新式设备的自动装鱼工具，以及机械加工的热炉。并且开始广泛的使用了玻璃包装材料。这些工作，不但建设了新的渔业，同时也扩展了旧的渔业工厂、包装工厂、造船工厂和修理渔船工厂等。
    今天苏联的渔业，已得到了广泛的无线电通讯网，使用飞机侦察鱼在水中的游路。同时苏联的渔业工业工作者，把自己的工作都根据科学院和试验所对于生物学的研究来进行渔捞工作。此外，并在莫斯科等地创立了渔业高等和中等专门学校，培养干部。渔业工业更拟定了渔捞规则和使用水域的制度。
    （三）苏联渔业组织管理系统
    在苏联，最初成立了人民供给委员会，专门管理食品工业和贸易的问题，其中设立了全苏渔业工业联盟，专门管理渔业工业发展问题。后来人民供给委员会中专门成立了人民食品工业委员会和人民贸易委员会。于是在食品委员会中，又成立了渔业工业管理总局，管理渔业发展问题。
    由于苏联国民经济的迅速发展，食品工业也更进一步发展起来。根据政府的决定，人民的食品委员会又分成三部：成立了苏维埃联盟食品工业部、渔业工业部、肉类奶品工业部。从这里我们可以看到苏联政府对于渔业的重视。在苏维埃联盟渔业工业部，设有一个部长和五个副部长管理业务。部长是由政府任命的，并且直接接受政府的监督，执行全部工作，推进渔业工业正确的发展。正部长负责执行总的领导，指示并监督全国渔业工业各部门的工作，他并直接领导最重要的、有决定意义的工作。副部长是具体的指导、监督、检查、指示一定部门的工作，像基本建设工程、物资技术的供给、造船工作、鱼的捞取和加工、成品销售、干部工作等。苏维埃联盟渔业工业部有一个中央机构，它是根据部的工作组织系统、工作条例执行工作。依照部的任务，它由下面各司组成：经济计划司、财政司、会计司、劳动工资司、技术司、基本建设工程司、贸易司、干部司、机械设备与动力司、燃料司、行政管理司、检查司、秘书室等。除了这些部门以外，还有几个管理总局，如东部地区渔业管理总局、西部地区渔业管理总局、渔业工业造船管理局、渔业工业基本建设工程管理局、渔业工业物资技术供给管理局、渔业工业成品贸易管理局、渔业工业包装材料管理局、全苏渔业组合联盟管理局、渔业繁殖保护管理总局等。所有渔业工业各种组织与各工厂，或者直接隶属或者通过地方组合联盟隶属渔业工业部和渔业工业管理总局。在产鱼最多区域并组成渔业工业组合，像黑海渔业组合、北部地区渔业组合、西伯利亚渔业组合等。除了这些以外，几乎在每一个苏联的加盟共和国都有他自己的渔业工业部，或者是渔业工业管理总局，专门管理他们地方上的渔业生产发展问题。在这些加盟共和国内的渔业机构组织与全苏总局一样，只是规模较小而已。渔业工业部、渔业工业管理总局、渔业组合对于批准的渔业工业财政计划，成为各地尊服的一个法律一样。这计划必须是永远很紧张的，号召前进的，并且充分的利用了一切物力人力。苏联人民教育了一个最好的传统，那就是虽然规定最高的计划，但他们总认为是最低的，苏联的五年计划永远不到五年就完成了。像五年的渔捞工作计划四年就完成了。一九四九年渔捞工作已超过了任务百分之一百二十二。渔业工业部、渔业管理总局、渔业组合动员了一切力量，渔民一切都为超过这个计划而努力。
    渔业工业部、渔业工业管理总局、渔业组合都要有系统的检查工作，纠正消灭工作中的缺点，保证供给材料，对各企业给以必要的帮助。各个渔业机构也要好好统计全部物资、渔捞工具、成品、设备、渔民力量、技术等情况。渔业工业部、渔业工业管理总局更要按照实际情况，拟具计划，采取一切办法，发展渔业工作，政府也给以帮助。每年政府要通过渔业工业的春期渔捞的准备工作的决议，以保证实行计划。每年由渔业工业部召开渔业会议，渔业工业经济计划会议，有各个企业行政与生产技术计划工作者、斯达哈诺夫工作者等参加，讨论研究总结过去的工作并具体拟定将来的生产计划。
    （四）苏联目前渔业的情况
    在苏德战争中，苏联国民经济受到了很大的损失，渔业工业当然也不能例外。在这次战争中，苏联损失了许多渔业工厂、船只和牺牲了很多的干部。但是苏联人民在战后很快的就投入了渔业的恢复与建设工作，苏联在解放战争中，就同时进行了恢复的斗争。一九四六年到一九五○年苏联人民经济恢复计划的法律规定要求迅速恢复食品工业各部门，渔业工业自然也在内。在渔业工业部门中，要求恢复战前品种，和提高质量。一九五○年渔业加工品要超过战前一倍半，新鲜和冰冻的要增加一·八倍，鱼肉浆增加三倍。并广泛开展北部地区和远东地区的渔业。恢复渔业要超过战前水平，在这期间中要使一百五十个大船出动；要建设十三个大的渔业罐头工厂、三十个冷藏工厂。为了实行一九四六年到一九五○年苏联人民经济恢复发展计划，苏联渔业工作人员动员了一切劳动与物资，所有的工程技术人员、斯达哈诺夫工作者、突击员的组织管理工作经验，利用了所有的一切成就。由于苏联劳动人民生产的积极，渔捞工作已经在四年中完成了。现在苏联每年每人至少可得十公斤鱼，这样算起来苏联的渔业不仅超过战前水平，并已超过了一倍半。
    关于苏联渔业工业，各地区情况是这样的：在渔捞工作数量上讲是远东地区鱼产贮藏量最大，但还未完全开发，鱼品种类很多，如比目鱼、鳕鱼、鲭鱼等。其次在苏联占第二位的是卡斯宾地区的伏尔加河、乌拉河、克拉河和德列高木等区域，这里鱼类主要的是鲭鱼、鲑鱼。占第三位的是苏北地区的木尔满斯科河区，这里鱼类多是鳕鱼、鲱鱼等。这些地区渔捞是机械化，渔捞工作是长年进行的。第四是黑海地区，有顿河、古班河、德涅普罗河、南布高河、杜南河下游。第五是波罗的海，这些地区鱼产数量较少了。此外湖沼水池产鱼量也很丰富。同时苏联更很快的发展了集体的渔业劳动生产，修筑了人工的水池，养殖镜面鲤鱼。集体渔庄的渔业劳动生产，是要供给它附近工业中心地区劳动者们新鲜的和冰冻的鱼品。
    为了适应湖沼养鱼和人工水池养殖优良品种鱼类，在苏联广泛的开始了用人工繁殖方法，大量培育了鱼苗，用飞机运往各养鱼地区。目前苏联每年还派特别航队到南极去捞鲸鱼，制鲸鱼油。这在医药或制造肥皂上有很大的用途。此外还派了航队到格林兰地区进行工作。在苏联逐年的增加渔捞的比重，国营的渔捞工作已由领导地位走向完全控制的地位。但这并不是说集体渔庄的渔捞工作减少了，实际上还是增加了，只是其占总生产量的比重并不大。而且苏联政府给集体渔庄的渔民很大的帮助，给他们船只和渔捞工具，帮助他们提高质量。
    在苏联近代渔业成品中是依据科学的方法加工的，在每一个工厂都有化验室，监督原料和生产过程。在苏联渔业工厂中有国家派去的检查员负责检查监督制成的成品，一切均得遵照标准，否则产品不得外运。同时并采取了许多办法实行卫生清洁。渔业各企业工厂一定要合乎卫生清洁的条件。最近几年苏联鱼类加工成品比较减少了，因为要提倡大批的冰冻的活鱼来供给人民食用，但对于干鱼的制造，像醋腌鱼仍是扩展的。
    在苏联，目前国营工厂中，渔业工人是按劳计资，工资是依照超额累进付给的。工人除每星期一天休息以外，一年还有两星期的休假，工资照付。给职工们建立了宿舍、救护站、诊疗所、休养所、避暑站以及学校、医院、托儿所、俱乐部等机关。公营工厂的社会保险工作、工人的文化政治教育工作都已积极的进行了。每年渔业工人并展开高度的生产竞赛，这使整个苏联公营企业的渔业的五年计划均已超额提前完成了。
