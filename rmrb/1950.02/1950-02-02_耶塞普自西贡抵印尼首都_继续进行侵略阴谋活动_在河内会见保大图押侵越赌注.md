Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 1st. Jessup, the ambassador-at-large sent by the US government to the Far East to carry out conspiracies of aggression, flew to Jakarta (Batavia), the capital of the United States of Indonesia, on the morning of the 29th after staying in Vietnam for four days, in order to continue his diplomatic conspiracies. Jessup left the United States on December 20 last year to begin his so-called "inspection" trip to the Far East. Jessup has been to Japan, South Korea, Okinawa, Taiwan, the Philippines, Vietnam and other places. After "inspecting" Indonesia, Jessup will go to Malaya and Burma, and then to Bangkok to preside over the "US Far East Diplomatic Personnel Conference" to be held on February 13, to discuss revising the overall US plan of aggression against the Far East. After Jessup flew to Saigon from Manila on the morning of the 24th of last month, he held several secret talks there with the organizers of the French war of aggression against Vietnam, French High Commissioner to Vietnam Pinon and French Commander-in-Chief Karpange. According to reports from American and French news agencies, Pinon requested the United States to quickly recognize Bảo Đại and provide weapons "aid" during the talks. On the 27th, Jessup personally went to Hanoi to meet with Bảo Đại, the puppet emperor supported by France in Vietnam, and puppet Prime Minister Nguyễn Văn Long, and personally handed over a letter from Acheson "congratulating" Bảo Đại on "assuming the position of head of state" to Bảo Đại. In his letter, Acheson stated that the United States is willing to "establish close relations" with the Bảo Đại government, that is to say, it is willing to recognize the Bảo Đại puppet regime. The Associated Press specifically pointed out that Jessup also agreed with the French request to recognize Bảo Đại, placing the United States' bet in Vietnam entirely on Bảo Đại.
    Before going to Vietnam, Jessup stayed in the American vassal state of the Philippines for four days, and repeatedly talked to the Philippine people about the platitudes of the "unique and close relationship" between the United States and the Philippines. However, on the 22nd, he said in the Philippine Congress: "The United States has assumed full responsibility for the defense of the Philippines." On the 24th, when bidding farewell to the Filipinos, he quoted Acheson's words: "In terms of international security, your interests are our interests." This means that the "close relationship" between the United States and the Philippines that Jessup talks about is to completely turn the Philippines into a US military base.

　　耶塞普自西贡抵印尼首都
    继续进行侵略阴谋活动   
    在河内会见保大图押侵越赌注
    【新华社北京一日电】美国政府派至远东进行侵略阴谋的无任所大使耶塞普，在越南勾留四天后，已于二十九日上午飞抵印尼合众国首都雅加达（即巴达维亚），继续进行其外交上的阴谋活动。耶塞普系于去年十二月二十日离美开始其所谓远东“视察”旅行。耶塞普已到过日本、南朝鲜、冲绳、台湾、菲律宾、越南等地。在印尼“视察”后，耶塞普将再赴马来亚和缅甸，然后至曼谷主持在二月十三日举行的“美国远东外交人员会议”，商讨重订美国对远东的全盘侵略计划。耶塞普于上月二十四日上午自马尼拉飞抵西贡后，在该地曾与法国侵越战争的组织者、法国驻越南高级专员皮农及法军总司令加尔庞吉埃等，举行数次秘密会谈。据美法各通讯社报道，皮农在会谈中曾要求美国迅速承认保大，并予以武器“援助”。二十七日，耶塞普又亲至河内，会见法国在越南扶植的儿皇帝保大与傀儡总理阮文龙，并将艾奇逊“祝贺”保大“担任元首”的一封信，面交保大。艾奇逊在其信中表示，美国愿与保大政府“建立密切的关系”，即是说，愿意承认保大傀儡政权。美联社特别指出，耶塞普亦赞同法国关于承认保大的要求，将美国在越南的赌注完全押在保大身上。
    耶塞普在赴越南之前，曾在美国附庸国菲律宾勾留四日，并几次向菲律宾人民侈谈其美菲间“独一无二亲密关系”的滥调。但廿二日他在菲律宾国会中却说：“美国已负起菲律宾的全面防御责任”，二十四日在告别菲人时，他又引艾奇逊的话说：“从国际安全的意义上来说，你们的利益就是我们的利益。”这就说，耶塞普口里所说的美菲“亲密关系”就是要把菲律宾完全变成美国的军事基地。
