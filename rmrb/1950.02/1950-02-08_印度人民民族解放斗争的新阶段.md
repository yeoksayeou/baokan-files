Marxism-Leninism teaches us that the leadership of the proletariat is the decisive condition for the victory of the national liberation struggle of the people in colonial and dependent countries. Only under the leadership of the working class—the most thoroughly revolutionary class—can the people of colonial and dependent countries free themselves from the oppression of imperialism and achieve complete independence. In the context of the extreme aggravation of the general crisis of capitalism, the deepening crisis of the colonial system, and the unprecedented rise of the national liberation struggle of the people in colonial and dependent countries, this basic tendency becomes increasingly obvious: that is, the struggle of oppressed nations against imperialist oppressors and domestic reactionaries is expanding and intensifying, and the leading position of the working class in the national liberation struggle is being unshakably consolidated. The fact that the working class has now become the recognized leader of the entire nation in the struggle against imperialist oppression in most colonial countries proves that this national liberation struggle has entered a new and more advanced stage of development. Comrade Stalin said: "The leading position of the proletariat can only be prepared and realized by the Communist Party."

The struggle of the Indian working class after the war has developed to an extremely large scale. The strike movement has developed to an unprecedented high level. In 1947 alone, in the Indian Federation, about two million workers participated in economic strikes. The characteristics of the post-war strike movement in India are the mass character, unity, and activism of the workers, as well as the participation of workers from small enterprises, indigenous people from the princely states, and staff members from state-owned and private enterprises among the proletariat and working people. The general participation of these strata in strikes, a significant feature, is the increased proportion of general strikes in the strike movement. These general strikes included broad strata of workers and staff in various industrial centers (many general strikes in cities such as Bombay and Calcutta) and provinces (the general strike of textile workers in the Central Provinces and Bihar, the general strike of teachers in Bombay Province, Punjab Province, and the United Provinces, etc.). Workers in separate departments have also held general strikes on a national scale (such as the general strike of postal and telecommunications workers). The very large scale of the strike struggle of the Indian working class plays a significant role in raising the revolutionary consciousness of the masses and in uniting them around the proletariat.

While fighting to realize its own economic demands, the Indian working class is also the vanguard and leader of mass anti-imperialist demonstrations against British rule. In November 1945 and February 1946, when the masses held anti-British riots in Calcutta and other cities, and in January and February 1946 when bloody clashes and pitched battles occurred in Bombay, the working class led the broad masses. Due to the activism of the working class, these demonstrations were of a militant and revolutionary nature.

Without the active support of the working class, the mutiny of naval sailors in Bombay and other cities in February 1946 would not have been possible. Bombay textile workers held a general strike to show solidarity with the sailors, and textile workers even engaged in three days of pitched battles. The general strike of textile workers in Bombay and the response strikes in other cities in India clearly demonstrate the leading role of the Indian working class in the anti-imperialist movement of the Indian working people.

The vanguard role of the working class is also manifested in the mass movements that occurred after the war in the reactionary strongholds of India—the Indian princely states (Travancore, Hyderabad, Indore, etc.). The workers' struggle signaled the unfolding of mass movements against feudal princes, against British rule, to abolish the feudal system within the princely states, and to democratize the princely states.

Since the partition of India, in the two dominions of India and Pakistan, the strike struggle against the attacks of capitalists and ruling groups on the living standards of workers and all working people has not stopped. In the Indian dominion, 1,634 economic strikes occurred in 1948, with more than 13 million workers participating.

After the partition, political strikes and mass demonstrations of workers developed on a large scale. These strikes and demonstrations were against the anti-people policies of the Indian National Congress government and the Pakistan Muslim League government, and against the persecution of the Communist Party, the All-India Trade Union Congress, and other progressive and democratic organizations by the governments of the two dominions.

The following proletarian political demonstrations are the most important events in the Indian situation: for example, the one-day general strike of 700,000 workers in Bombay to protest the Congress government's abolition of price controls (December 1947), the one-day general strike of 100,000 workers in Calcutta to oppose the passage of a law by the Bengal Provincial Legislative Assembly granting special powers to the Bengal government (January 1948), the one-day general strike of 200,000 workers in the Central Provinces and Bihar to oppose the government's anti-labor policies (March 1948), the one-day general strike of 50,000 workers in Calcutta to protest the passage of anti-labor bills (July 1948), and a whole series of other large-scale political demonstrations (a large part of which were strikes to protest the persecution of the Communist Party).

The brilliant victories of the Chinese People's Liberation Army have generated a huge response in India and Pakistan. In many cities of the two dominions, rallies and demonstrations were held under the leadership of the Communist Party and other trade union organizations to express solidarity with the Chinese people. The heroic struggle of the Chinese people for freedom and democracy cannot but have a huge impact on the further expansion and deepening of the national liberation movement in India and Pakistan.

On the eve of World War II, the influence of the working class and the Communist Party on Indian peasants had already significantly increased. Many peasant associations led by revolutionaries had emerged in India. Many mass demonstrations of peasants have been carried out under revolutionary slogans and under the leadership of Communists. During the war, especially in the post-war period, the peasant associations united under the "All-India Kisan Sabha" greatly strengthened and led the mass movement of peasants. Revolutionary-led peasant associations now exist throughout India (including the princely states). Their influence is particularly great in southern India.

The post-war Indian peasant movement is developing under the slogan of consolidating the worker-peasant alliance, and this movement is closely linked to the overall democratic movement that has developed under the leadership of the working class and the Communist Party.

In eastern and northern Bengal and some areas of Orissa, tenant farmers are fighting for rent reduction. Shortly after the end of the war, this struggle in Bengal had the largest scale and combat nature. Tenant farmers in 20 districts of Bengal stopped handing over the harvested grain to the landlords and refused to pay half of the harvest as rent. As a fait accompli, they only paid one-third of the harvest as rent, keeping the rest for themselves. The peasant movement in Bengal, known as "one-third rent reduction" (reducing the rent to one-third of the harvest), has in fact continued intermittently for about three years.

The struggle of peasants is expanding in Bihar and Orissa (India) and some areas of West Punjab and the Northwest Frontier Province (Pakistan), where landlords are expelling peasants from the rented land in large numbers, and the peasants are resisting. Peasants always refuse to give up the land they rent from landlords, resulting in open clashes with the police.

The situation of peasants in Madras Province has deteriorated greatly in recent years due to crop failures and famine, and the peasant movement in the province has developed to a very sharp nature. In Madras Province, not only are there revolutionary peasant associations participating by entire villages, but there are even revolutionary peasant associations participating by entire districts. The main form of the peasant movement in Madras Province is the confiscation of landlords' grain. The peasant associations then organize the distribution of grain to particularly poor peasants. Peasants often distribute confiscated grain to workers, especially during strikes (such as in Chirala and other areas). The movement to confiscate landlords' granaries has developed particularly widely in northern Malabar (on the coastal area of western Madras) and often develops into open conflicts with the police and the army. In some areas of Madras Province (Krishna, Godavari, Guntur), there are peasant guerrillas active.

In many areas of India, agricultural workers play a huge role in the peasant movement, and agricultural workers cannot but be an important force in the development of the land revolution. Agricultural workers' strikes in Bihar have had a decisive influence on the development of the peasant movement. In some areas where the "one-third rent reduction" movement in Bengal Province is developing, agricultural workers fight alongside peasants, holding strikes and actively participating in peasant rallies and demonstrations. Agricultural workers in Madras Province, organized in peasant associations, participate with peasants in the movement to confiscate landlords' grain. The struggle of agricultural workers in the United Provinces and other provinces is also intensifying. In the Gorakhpur area (in eastern United Provinces), where landlords attempted to deprive peasants of their right to cultivate the land, 1,500 agricultural workers on one farm declared that the land was theirs and raised a red flag on the farm. In Bombay Province (India) and East Bengal Province (Pakistan), the struggle of agricultural workers for liberation and the implementation of monetary wages has developed on a considerable scale (such as in Bengal's Warri and Hari area, and Bengal's Nankali).

India and Pakistan are now increasingly frequently starting to raise demands for the uncompensated confiscation of landlords' land and the distribution of land to peasants. Such demands have been made in many peasant rallies and peasant representative conferences in Madras Province, Bombay Province, Bihar Province, West Bengal Province, East Bengal Province, the Northwest Frontier Province, and other places. The Indian National Congress government and the Pakistan Muslim League government do not implement even the simplest democratic reforms and openly support feudal landlords, which cannot but promote the further strengthening of the peasant movement and advance it to a more advanced stage.

The countless peasant rallies and peasant demonstrations held throughout India to protest the persecution of the Communist Party and the mass arrests of Communists demonstrate the growing influence of the working class and the Communist Party on the peasants and the increase in the peasants' political activism.

In the Guntur district of Madras, tens of thousands of peasants demonstrated under the slogan "Demand an end to the suppression of the Communist Party." The peasants chanted slogans. After the demonstration, a rally was held with 10,000 participants.

In the Bettiah area of Bihar Province, 7,000 peasants held a rally under the call of the peasant association, demanding the immediate uncompensated confiscation of landlords' land, the release of arrested Communists, and the abolition of the ban on the Communist Party in West Bengal.

The peasant movement in Telangana, within the Hyderabad princely state, has developed to its highest stage after the war. The peasants there are mainly Telugu (or Andhra) people, who have risen up to fight feudal exploitation and have also raised the demand to merge the areas of this ethnic group belonging to the Hyderabad princely state with the areas of the same ethnic group within the Indian Federation. The combination of anti-feudal struggle and national struggle has contributed to the particular sharpness of the Telangana peasant movement. The peasant movement against the landlords and the autocratic rule of the Hyderabad prince has developed in Telangana to have the nature of an armed uprising and land revolution. As a result, in one-sixth of the territory of this princely state (with a population of four million), the rule of the princes and landlords was overthrown. In 2,500 villages in Telangana, the landlords' land was distributed to landless and land-poor peasants and agricultural workers, the debts owed by workers to landlords and usurers were abolished, elected people's organs and courts were established, and people's armies were formed. The Indian government sent troops into Telangana in September 1949 in an attempt to suppress the revolutionary movement. The expeditionary army has been fighting fiercely in Telangana for a year. However, they have failed to conquer the fighting spirit of the peasants or suppress their heroic struggle. The peasant war is continuing, it has the nature of a guerrilla war, and it has spread to neighboring areas, especially to the areas of Madras Province inhabited by Andhra people.

The Telangana peasant movement is closely linked to the workers' struggle in Hyderabad and is being carried out under the leadership of the working class and left-wing groups. The situation in Telangana is the clearest example of India's revolutionary struggle for land and democracy and is the first step towards the realization of people's democracy in India. The struggle in Telangana is the first sign of the land revolution in India, which is the most important content of the current stage of the national liberation struggle in India.

Peasants in other parts of India and Pakistan have also begun to emulate the example of Telangana to varying degrees. In many rural areas of the United Provinces, the Central Provinces, and other provinces, peasant uprisings against landlord oppression are taking place more and more frequently. According to the Indian Trust News Agency, in the first half of 1949 alone, 2,057 peasant uprisings and disturbances occurred in the United Provinces of India.

The working class and the Communist Party must overcome serious difficulties in the struggle to win over the peasants. Reactionary Gandhian ideas still have a strong influence among the peasants. Although the upper echelons of the National Congress have betrayed and sold out the country, the National Congress still maintains some influence among the peasant masses. The phenomenon that the peasants have not yet eliminated their illusions about the National Congress can also explain why the divisive "All-India Peasant Conference" led by Patel-Nehru lackeys (the likes of Ranga) can still find ground for engaging in treasonous activities among the peasants. Socialist Party leaders are also trying to carry out sabotage activities among the peasant masses.

In recent years, the prestige of the Indian working class has greatly consolidated among the lower strata of the urban petty bourgeoisie. The active participation of the urban petty bourgeoisie in the fighting mass political demonstrations under the leadership of the Communist Party is evidence of this. In recent years, the influence of Communists in many mass organizations, democratic student organizations, youth organizations, and other progressive organizations has also strengthened.

### 印度人民民族解放斗争的新阶段

　　印度人民民族解放斗争的新阶段
    马列主义教导我们：无产阶级的领导权，乃是殖民地国家及附属国家人民的民族解放斗争胜利的决定条件。只有在工人阶级——最彻底的革命阶级——的领导之下，殖民地国家及附属国家的人民，才能摆脱帝国主义的压迫并实现完全的独立。在资本主义总危机极端恶化，殖民制度危机愈益加深、殖民地国家及附属国家人民的民族解放斗争空前无比地高涨的情况之下，它的这种基本倾向就愈来愈明显：即被压迫民族对帝国主义压迫者及国内反动派的斗争日益扩大和激烈，工人阶级在民族解放斗争中的领导地位的不可动摇地巩固。在大多数殖民地国家中，工人阶级现在已经成为全国人民反对帝国主义压迫斗争中的公认的领导者，这就证明了这个民族解放斗争已经进入一个新的更高级的发展阶段。斯大林同志说过：“无产阶级的领导地位，只能由共产党来准备和实现。”
    战后印度工人阶级的斗争，发展到了极其巨大的规模。罢工运动已经发展到空前无比的高度水平。在一九四七年内，仅仅在印度联邦，就有约二百万职工参加过经济罢工。印度战后罢工运动的特点，是工人的群众性、团结性和积极性以及无产阶级和劳动人民中间又有小企业工人、土邦土人、国营和私营企业中的职员等等。这些阶层的普遍参加罢工，显著的特点是总罢工在罢工运动中的比重增加。这种总罢工包括了各个工业中心城市（孟买、加尔各答等城市的许多次总罢工）以及全省（中央省和比拉尔的纺织工人总罢工，孟买省、旁遮普省和联合省教员总罢工等等）的工人和职员的广大阶层。各别部门的工人，也举行过全国规模的总罢工（如邮电职工总罢工）。印度工人阶级罢工斗争的非常巨大的规模，对于人民大众的革命觉悟的提高以及对于使他们团结到无产阶级周围这些方面，也有很大的作用。
    印度工人阶级一面在为实现自身的经济要求而斗争，同时也是反对英国统治的群众性反帝示威的先锋和领导者。一九四五年十一月和一九四六年二月，在加尔各答以及在其他城市的群众举行反英暴动的时候，在一九四六年一月到二月孟买发生浴血冲突和对垒战的时候，工人阶级都是领导着广大的群众的。由于工人阶级的积极性，这些示威都具有战斗的和革命的性质。
    如果没有工人阶级的积极支持，一九四六年二月孟买及其他城市海军海员的暴动，是不可能进行的。孟买纺织工人举行总罢工，表示与海员团结，纺织工人并且还进行了三天的对垒战。孟买纺织工人的总罢工以及印度其他城市的响应罢工，就足以明显地说明印度工人阶级在印度劳动人民反帝运动中的领导作用。
    工人阶级的先锋作用，还表现在战后发生于印度反动堡垒——印度土邦（特拉凡哥尔、海德拉巴和印度尔等等）中的群众运动。工人斗争是反封建王公、反英国统治、争取废除土邦内封建制度与争取土邦民主化的群众运动展开的信号。
    自从印度分治以来，在印度和巴基斯坦两自治领里，反对资本家和统治集团进攻工人和全体劳动人民生活标准的罢工斗争便没有停止过。在印度自治领，一九四八年发生过一千六百三十四次经济罢工，有一千三百万以上的工人参加。
    分治之后，工人的政治性罢工和群众性示威发展到很大的规模。这些罢工和示威，是为了反对印度国大党政府和巴基斯坦回教联盟政府的反人民政策，反对两自治领政府对共产党、对全印职工大会和其他进步和民主团体的迫害。
    下面所列举的无产阶级政治性示威，都是印度局势中的最重大事件：譬如孟买七十万工人为抗议国大党政府取消物价管制而举行的一天总罢工（一九四七年十二月），加尔各答十万工人为反对孟加拉省立法议会通过关于授予孟加拉政府特别权力的法律而举行的一天总罢工（一九四八年一月），中央省和比拉尔二十万工人为反对政府的反劳工政策而举行的一天总罢工（一九四八年三月），加尔各答五万工人为抗议通过反劳工法案而举行的一天总罢工（一九四八年七月）以及整个系列的其他政治性大示威（其中很大一部分是为了抗议迫害共产党而举行的罢工）。
    中国人民解放军的辉煌胜利，在印度和巴基斯坦产生了巨大的反响。两自治领的许多城市，都在共产党和其他职工团体领导之下举行了大会和示威，表示与中国人民团结一致。中国人民为自由和民主而进行的英勇斗争，不能不对印度和巴基斯坦民族解放运动的进一步扩大和深入产生巨大影响。
    在第二次世界大战前夕，工人阶级和共产党对印度农民的影响已经显著地增强。印度已经出现了许多由革命分子领导的农联会。许多次农民群众性示威，已经在革命的口号之下和在共产党人领导之下进行。在大战期间，特别是在战后期间，“全印农民组织”之下所团结的农联会，大大地加强着和领导着农民的群众运动。印度全国各地（包括土邦在内）现在都已经有了革命分子领导之下的农联会。它们在印度南部的影响特别巨大。
    战后印度农民运动是在巩固工农联盟的口号之下发展着，这个运动与工人阶级和共产党领导之下发展起来的总的民主运动密切联系着。
    在孟加拉东部和北部以及奥里萨省若干地区，佃农为减租而进行斗争。在大战结束后不久，孟加拉省的这种斗争具有最巨大的规模和战斗性质。孟加拉省二十个县的佃农，停止将收割来的谷物缴给地主，拒绝缴纳占收获量二分之一的地租。他们以既成事实的方式，只缴收获量三分之一的地租，其余的自己留下来。以“三分减租”（把地租减到收获量的三分之一）著称的孟加拉省农民运动，事实上已经时起时落地继续了大约三年。
    比哈尔和奥里萨省（印度）以及西旁遮普省和西北边省（巴基斯坦）某些地区的农民斗争在扩大着，地主要把农民成批地逐出所租的土地，农民们进行对抗。农民总是拒绝让出他们从地主租得的土地，于是和警察发生公开冲突。
    马德拉斯省的农民状况，在近几年来由于歉收和饥馑而非常恶化，该省农民运动已经发展到具有非常尖锐的性质。在马德拉斯省，不仅有全村参加革命的农联会，甚至还有全县参加革命的农联会。马德拉斯省农民运动的主要形式，是没收地主的谷物。农联会然后再把谷物有组织地分配给特别穷苦的农民。农民常常把没收来的谷物分给工人，特别是在罢工的时候（譬如在奇拉卡尔和在其他地区）。没收地主谷仓的运动，在马拉巴尔（按系在马德拉斯西部滨海一带）北部发展得特别普遍，并且时常发展到对警察和军队发生公开的冲突。在马德拉斯省某些地区（基斯特纳、哥达瓦里、贡都尔），有农民游击队在活动。
    在印度的许多地区，农业工人在农民运动中发挥着巨大的作用，农业工人不能不是土地革命的发展中的重要力量。比哈尔的农业工人罢工，曾对农民运动的发展给了决定作用的影响。在孟加拉省“三一减租”运动发展着的某些地区内，农业工人与农民并肩斗争，农业工人举行罢工并积极参加农民的集会和示威。组织在农联会里的马德拉斯省农业工人，和农民一起参加没收地主谷物的运动。联合省和其他省的农业工人的斗争，也在加紧进行着。在高拉赫普尔地区（按在联合省东部），地主企图剥夺农民耕种土地的权利，一个农场的一千五百名农业工人就宣布这些土地是自己的，并且在农场上扬起红旗。在孟买省（印度）和东孟加拉省（巴基斯坦）农业工人为争取解放与实行货币工资制的斗争，已经发展到相当大的规模（如在孟加拉的瓦尔里和哈里区，孟加拉的南卡里）。
    印度和巴基斯坦现在愈来愈经常地开始提出关于无偿没收地主土地并将土地分配给农民的要求。在马德拉斯省、孟买省、比哈尔省、西孟加拉省、东孟加拉省、西北边省和其他地方的许多次农民大会和农民代表会议中，都提出过这种要求。印度的国大党政府和巴基斯坦的回教联盟政府，甚至连最简便的民主改革都完全不实行，并且还公开支持封建地主，这种情形不能不促使农民运动进一步加强，并且将它推进到更高级的阶段。
    印度各地为抗议迫害共产党和抗议成批逮捕共产党人而举行的无数次农民大会和农民示威，就证明了工人阶级和共产党对农民影响的增长以及农民的政治积极性的提高。
    在马德拉斯的贡都尔地区，成千成万的农民在“要求停止镇压共产党”的口号之下举行示威。农民们高呼口号示威。示威之后举行大会，大会有一万人参加。
    在比哈尔省的贝特纳地区，七千农民在农联会号召之下举行大会，要求立即无偿没收地主的土地，释放被捕的共产党人和废除对西孟加拉共产党的禁令。
    海德拉巴土邦之内特仑冈达地方的农民运动，在战后已经发展到最高阶段。那里的农民主要是德鲁古（或安德拉）族人，他们起来对封建剥削斗争，同时还提出了这样的要求：将属于海德拉巴土邦的这个民族的地区，与印度联邦内其同族的地区合并。反封建斗争与民族斗争的结合，促成了特仑冈达农民运动的特别尖锐性。反地主、反海德拉巴王公专制统治的农民运动，在特仑冈达发展到具有武装起义和土地革命的性质。结果，在这个土邦（拥有人口四百万）的六分之一领土上，海邦王公和地主的统治被推翻了。在特仑冈达二千五百个村庄里，地主的土地被分配给无地和少地的农民以及农业工人，工人欠地主和高利贷者的债务被废除了，选举产生的人民机关和法院成立了，人民军组成了。印度政府于一九四九年九月派遣军队进入特仑冈达，企图镇压革命运动。讨伐军在特仑冈达激烈作战以来已经有一年了。然而，他们未能征服农民的战斗精神或压制他们的英勇斗争。农民战争正在继续着，它具有游击战的性质，并且已经扩展到邻近地区，特别是马德拉斯省里住着安德拉人的地区。
    特仑冈达的农民运动与海德拉巴的工人斗争密切联系着，并且是在工人阶级和左翼团体领导之下进行着。特仑冈达的局势是印度的争取土地和民主的革命斗争的最明显例子，并且是人民民主在印度实现的第一个步骤。特仑冈达的斗争是印度土地革命的第一个征兆，土地革命是印度现阶段民族解放斗争的最重要内容。
    印度和巴基斯坦其他部分的农民，也已经开始在这个或那个程度上仿效着特仑冈达的榜样。在联合省、中央省及其他省的许多农村，反对地主压迫的农民起义，正在愈来愈经常地进行着。据印度托辣斯通讯社报道：在一九四九年上半年，仅仅在印度联合省，就发生了二千另五十七次农民起义和骚动。
    工人阶级和共产党必须克服在争取农民的斗争中的严重困难。反动的甘地思想仍然在农民中具有强烈的影响。虽然国大党的上层背叛和卖国，但是，国大党仍然在农民群众中保持着某些影响。农民还没有消除对国大党的幻想，这个现象也能说明巴特尔——尼赫鲁走卒们（兰格之辈）所领导的分裂的“全印农民大会”何以还能在农民中觅得从事叛国活动的园地的原因。社会党领袖们也力图在农民群众中进行破坏活动。
    近几年来，印度工人阶级在城市小资产阶级较低阶层中间的威信已经大大巩固。城市小资产阶级积极参加在共产党领导之下的战斗的群众性政治示威，就是证据。近几年来，共产党人在许多群众团体、民主学生团体、青年团体和其他进步团体中的影响也加强了。
