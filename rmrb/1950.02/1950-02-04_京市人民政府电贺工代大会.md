　　Beijing Municipal People's Government Sends Congratulatory Telegram to Workers' Congress
　　[Beijing News] The Beijing Municipal People's Government sent a telegram on the 2nd to congratulate the first Beijing Municipal Workers' Representative Congress. The full text is as follows: To the First Beijing Municipal Workers' Representative Congress:
　　Since the liberation of Beijing a year ago, production has been considerably restored and developed, mainly relying on the efforts of the working class. Many labor heroes and production models have emerged in the ranks of workers, constantly creating new production records. Continuing to restore and develop production remains our overriding central task in the future. Because only by developing production can we reduce unemployment, only by developing production can we improve the lives of workers and other working people, and only by developing production can we make Beijing, a consumer city, gradually move towards becoming a production city. Let us work together to develop production!
　　In the past year, under the leadership of the Preparatory Committee of the Beijing Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, 180,000 workers have been organized. You are now holding the first Workers' Representative Congress. We wish
　　the Congress success and the good health of all representatives!
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　Beijing Municipal People's Government

　　京市人民政府电贺工代大会
    【北京讯】北京市人民政府二日电贺京市首届工人代表大会，全文如下：北京市第一次工人代表大会公鉴：
    北京市解放一年来，生产已有了相当恢复和发展，这主要是依靠工人阶级的努力。在工人的队伍中出现了很多劳动英雄和生产模范，不断地创造了生产上的新纪录。今后继续恢复与发展生产仍然是我们压倒一切的中心任务。因为只有发展生产才能减少失业，只有发展生产才有可能改善工人及其他劳动人民的生活，只有发展生产才有可能使北京这个消费城市逐步走向生产城市。让我们为发展生产，共同努力吧！
    一年来，你们在北京市总工会筹委会的领导下已经有十八万工友组织起来了，你们现在正召开第一次工人代表大会，谨祝
    大会的胜利和各位代表的健康！
          北京市人民政府
