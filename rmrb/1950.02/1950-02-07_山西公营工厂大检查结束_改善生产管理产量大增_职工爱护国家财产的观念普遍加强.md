　　[Our Newspaper] Shanxi Province's state-owned and public factories and mines launched a major production inspection movement at the end of November last year, which concluded successively by the end of December. The movement was carried out in the spirit of relying on all employees, promoting democracy, and conducting criticism and self-criticism. Initially, some employees adopted a wait-and-see attitude and were unwilling to offer opinions. For example, at the Match Factory, employees had raised many opinions about the factory's work in the past, but the leadership had not studied these opinions in detail, nor had they taken appropriate actions in a timely manner according to their importance and urgency. When this major inspection began, the leadership again mobilized everyone to offer opinions, but the workers felt that offering opinions was useless and adopted a passive attitude towards the major inspection. Later, the administrative and trade union leaders of each factory made self-criticisms, explaining that mistakes must be corrected, and the workers then began to actively offer opinions again. The employees of only six units, including the Taiyuan Flour Company, Match Company, Tobacco Company, Limin Chemical Company, Industrial and Mining Construction Company, and Woolen Mill, raised more than 1,600 opinions. Workers at the Printing Company's Second Factory raised more than 40 suggestions for improving security work. Zhao Rongxiang, a worker at Limin Chemical Company, suggested, "Water pipes and ironware are very expensive, and the person in charge of the warehouse throws these things casually on the ground and in the yard. Now they are all rusty. This is irresponsible towards national property." Worker Chen Bucheng suggested, "The quality of sodium sulfide is not good, which affects sales. This is because the day shift workers in the sodium sulfide department are not careful in their work and leave work before the night shift arrives." He said: Labor discipline needs to be thoroughly rectified. Jin-Hua Textile Factory, due to promoting democracy and implementing the spirit of relying on the masses, 93 percent of the workers participated in the major inspection.

　　Emergency Inspections and Emergency Measures: Quickly Correcting Dangerous Situations
　　During the inspection, most factories and mines adopted the method of emergency inspections and emergency measures, quickly correcting many dangerous situations and unreasonable phenomena, improving safety equipment, and stopping wasteful practices. After inspection, the Printing Company's Second Factory immediately cleared flammable items placed around the warehouse. The small drying machine at the Tobacco Company was leaking smoke, and it was repaired overnight after inspection. The original site of a factory was an enemy ammunition depot, and 20,000 hand grenades were dug up when inspecting the location for installing a boiler. Another factory discovered a batch of discarded detonators and explosives and immediately implemented an emergency transfer. After a mass inspection at the Jinsheng Textile Factory, 484 incidents were found that directly or indirectly hindered production, including 4 related to machine maintenance, 33 related to waste of resources, 8 related to theft, 13 related to fire safety, and more than 300 other incidents. The causes of these incidents are being gradually overcome. The weaving workshop of the factory corrected the route of the No. 1 motor, ensuring the safety of the motor. Leveling machines were started in the roving room, and bad yarn tubes were removed in the spinning room, greatly reducing the waste of cotton. Many factories have also formulated various systems to ensure safety, prevent waste, and improve production. After discussion, the Tobacco Company formulated door control systems, reward and punishment systems, quality inspection systems, and leave systems. Yangquan No. 4 Mine formulated machine safety standard systems, security reward and punishment systems, and specific division of labor systems for each section. Workers at the Jin-Hua Weaving Factory voluntarily proposed to strictly enforce the systems, and the leadership mobilized everyone to deliberate and discuss, formulating various management systems, such as shift handover systems and inspection systems.

　　After the inspection, the employees of the province's state-owned and public factories and mines further realized that they were the masters of the enterprise, thereby strengthening their sense of cherishing national property. Tian Quanxi, a shaft worker at Jin-Hua Textile Factory, said: "In the past, I worked well when I was happy and procrastinated when I was not happy; after this inspection, I realized that the factory and I are inseparable. In the past, it took one hour to put on a shaft, now it only takes 15 minutes." Some workers said: "The factory is state property, and we are the masters of the country. National property must be cherished." Workers at the Printing Company's Second Factory also reflected this way: damaging the factory is damaging the property of us workers, because the property is our own. Workers at the factory automatically suggested to the leadership to improve the method of cutting paper, which played a significant role in saving paper. When the lithographic department ruined New Year pictures, worker Zhang Henian initially thought it had nothing to do with him. After a group inspection and a talk with the factory director, he began to understand that this was damaging state property and quickly became an active participant in the inspection work. Under the influence of workers consciously abiding by labor discipline, the awareness of the factory staff has also improved. A technician named Zhu at the No. 1 Flour Company, who had been at odds with the workers in the past, expressed his determination to unite with the workers and do a good job in production after this inspection.

　　After the major inspection, the output and quality of each factory have significantly improved. According to statistics from the spinning mill of Jin-Hua Textile Factory, the yarn output in half a month from December 12th to 27th increased by 12.6 percent compared with the same period before the inspection. Waste consumption decreased by 3.95 percent compared to before the inspection. The average ratio of second-grade cloth in November was 15.9 percent, which decreased to 2.9 percent in December. Sawmill workers at the Match Factory increased their output by one-third. The kiln group used to bake a kiln of wood in 80 hours, now it has been reduced to 48 hours. The Flour Factory has jumped from the standard quota of 1,200 bags per day to 1,560 bags per day, creating an amazing new record, and the quality of the flour has also improved. The Taiyuan Industrial and Mining Construction Company's repair shop adopted workers' rationalization suggestions and formulated a progressive bonus system for exceeding quotas, and output increased rapidly. In the past, each worker produced 15 stoves, now they produce 35. The production of pig iron washers has increased from 60 per worker to 270. In the past, the highest daily output of Jin-Hua Textile Factory was 1,060 pieces, and after the inspection, it quickly rose to 1,280 pieces. Workers at the Tobacco Company and the Industrial and Mining Construction Company have now voluntarily proposed production competitions, which will play a major role in ensuring the restoration and development of production, and the improvement of output and quality this year.

　　山西公营工厂大检查结束
    改善生产管理产量大增
    职工爱护国家财产的观念普遍加强
    【本报讯】山西省各国营公营工厂矿山，于去年十一月底开展生产大检查运动，迄十二月底先后结束。运动是在依靠全体职工、发扬民主、展开批评与自我批评的精神下进行的。开始时，有些职工抱着观望态度，不愿提意见。如火柴厂，职工过去对厂里的工作提出过不少意见，当时领导上没有详细研究这些意见，分别轻重缓急及时作适当的处理。这次大检查开始，领导方面又发动大家提意见，工人们认为提意见不顶事，对大检查采取消极态度。后来各厂行政、工会负责同志向大家作了检讨，说明有错误一定要改，工人们才又开始积极的提出意见。仅太原面粉公司、火柴公司、烟草公司、利民化学公司、工矿建设公司、毛织厂等六个单位的职工，即提出意见一千六百多条。印刷公司二厂工人，提出四十多条改进保安工作的意见。利民化学公司工人赵荣祥提出“水管铁器价钱都很贵，管仓库的人把这些东西随便扔在地下和院里，现在都生了锈，这是对国家资财不负责任。”工人陈补成提出“硫化碱质量不好，影响销路，是由于硫化碱部的白班工人不细心干活，不等夜班到来就下班。”他说：劳动纪律需要切实整顿。晋华纺织厂由于发扬了民主，贯彻了依靠群众的精神，有百分之九十三的工人参加了大检查。
  紧急检查紧急措施  迅速纠正危险事态
    在检查中，大部工厂矿山采取了紧急检查紧急措施的办法，迅速纠正了许多危险事态和不合理现象，改进了安全设备，停止了浪费现象。印刷公司二厂经检查后，立即清除了放置在仓库周围容易燃烧的物品。烟草公司小干燥机漏烟，经检查后连夜修好。某工厂厂址原是敌人的弹药库检查时在安锅炉的地方挖出二万颗手榴弹。另一工厂发现一批废雷管和炸药，立即实行紧急转移。晋生纺织厂经过群众性的检查后，发现直接或间接障碍生产的事故四百八十四件，其中包括机器检修方面的四件，浪费资财方面的三十三件，偷盗方面的八件，消防方面的十三件，其它事故三百余件。造成这些事故的原因，正被逐步克服着。该厂织布厂修正了一号马达的路线，保证了马达的安全。粗纱间开始了平车，细纱间拣除了坏纱管，大大减少了棉花的浪费。许多工厂并订出了保证安全、防止浪费、改进生产的各种制度。烟草公司经过大家讨论，订出了门禁制度、奖惩制度、质量检查制度以及请假制度等。阳泉四矿订出机器安全标准制度、保安奖惩制度、各股具体分工制度。晋华织布厂工人们自动提出要严格制度，领导上就发动大家酝酿讨论，订出了各种管理制度，如交接班制度和检查制度等。
    经过检查后，该省各国营公营工厂矿山职工进一步认识了自己就是企业的主人，从而加强了爱护国家财产的观念。晋华纺织厂上轴工人田泉喜说：“过去我高兴就好好的干，不高兴就拖拉；经过这次检查后，我认识到工厂和我是分不开的，过去上一个轴要一点钟，现在只需十五分钟。”有的工友说：“工厂是国家的财产，我们是国家的主人，国家财产必须爱护。”印刷公司二厂工人也都这样反映：损害了工厂就是损害了我们工人的财产，因为财产是咱们自己的。该厂工人自动向领导上建议改善裁纸的办法，在节约用纸上起了很大作用。平版系把年画印坏了，工人张鹤年开始认为与他无关。经过小组检查和厂长的谈话后，他开始懂得这是损害了国家财产，很快就变成了一个对检查工作的积极分子。在工人自觉遵守劳动纪律的影响下，各厂职员的认识水平也提高了，面粉公司一厂一位姓祝的技师，过去和工人闹不团结，这次检查后，他表示决心要和工人打成一片，搞好生产工作。
    经过大检查后，各厂产量质量已有显著提高。据晋生纺织厂纱厂统计，十二月十二日到二十七日半月的产纱量，较检查前同一期间增产百分之十二点六。下脚消耗较检查前减少了百分之三点九五。十一月份次布平均比率为十五点九，十二月份则降低为百分之二点九。火柴厂锯木工提高产量三分之一。烤窑组过去八十小时烤一窑木料，现在已减到四十八小时。面粉厂由定额日产一千二百袋的标准，一跃而为日产一千五百六十袋，创造出惊人的新纪录，面粉的质量也提高了。太原工矿建设公司修造厂采用了工人合理化建议和制订了超额累进奖励制，产量迅速提高，以前每工生产火炉十五个，现在生产三十五个。生产生铁垫圈，由每工六十个增加到二百七十个。晋华纺织厂过去每天最高产量为一千零六十匹，检查后迅速上升到一千二百八十匹。烟草公司工人和工矿建设公司工人，现已自动提出生产竞赛，这对今年恢复与发展生产，提高产量质量，将起重大的保证作用。
