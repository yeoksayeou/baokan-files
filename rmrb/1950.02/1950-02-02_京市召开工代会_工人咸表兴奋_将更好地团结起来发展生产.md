　　Beijing Holds Workers' Congress
    Workers Express Excitement
    Will Unite Better to Develop Production
    [Beijing News] Beijing workers were very excited after hearing the news that the Beijing Workers' Congress will open today (2nd), and they have put forward many opinions and hopes. They firmly believe that after this congress, with the formal establishment of the Federation of Trade Unions, the trade union organization will be more consolidated, and the enthusiasm for production will be further enhanced. Yin Bingnan and Tian Mao, workers at the Beijing Telecommunications Bureau, said: After this congress, our workers will be better united and will be able to exert greater power in restoring and developing production. Liu Chengyong, a telephone operator at the Second Telephone Bureau, hopes to establish workers' spare-time literacy schools to improve workers' cultural and political levels. Feng Qi, a worker at the Beijing Liberation Printing Factory, hopes that after the establishment of the Federation of Trade Unions, it will provide more guidance to workers' cultural and recreational activities, publish more publications to strengthen the connection between factories, and he hopes that the resolution of the Beijing Second Session of the People's Representatives on the relief of unemployed employees will be discussed at this congress. Qiu Xiangru, a representative of the match industry workers, said: During the preparation for the conference, our representatives went deep into the masses to solicit everyone's opinions. Everyone hopes to organize all the workers in the factories that have not been organized, unite together, and meet the production tasks of 1950. Qian Duansheng, Deputy Director of the Preparatory Committee of the Beijing Education Workers' Union, said: The opening of the first Beijing Workers' Congress and the formal establishment of the Beijing Federation of Trade Unions will enable the workers' strength to be brought into greater play, and the workers' interests will be better guaranteed. Education workers are particularly excited to participate in the Workers' Congress; our fifteen representatives include teachers and workers, but most of them are mental workers. It is the first time I know that mental workers and physical workers are gathering together; we must learn from the workers and strive to gradually eliminate the distance between physical and mental workers.
