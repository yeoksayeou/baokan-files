　　Let's Uphold the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance, and Mutual Assistance with Our Actions
　　Yang Gengtian

　　As the Liberation War approached nationwide victory and the first Spring Festival after the founding of the People's Republic of China arrived, the two great brotherly nations of China and the Soviet Union concluded the Treaty of Friendship, Alliance, and Mutual Assistance and agreements on the Chinese Changchun Railway, Lushunkou, Dalian, and loans. This is truly a double blessing. Farmers in North China and across China, along with worker brothers and people from all walks of life, are jubilantly celebrating.

　　During the eight-year War of Resistance Against Japan and the more than three years of the Liberation War, China's 400 million farmers and the vast rural areas suffered the most from the disasters caused by Japanese imperialism and Chiang Kai-shek's bandit gang, the running dogs of American imperialism. For the sake of survival, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and with the heroic fighting of the People's Liberation Army, we did our utmost to support the Liberation War until the final victory. Based on our past personal experiences, we deeply understand that the Soviet Union is our most reliable friend. It has provided the Chinese people with the greatest moral and material support in all aspects, and after the founding of the People's Republic of China, the Soviet Union was the first brotherly country to establish diplomatic relations with us.

　　Thanks to the wise decisions of Marshal Stalin and Chairman Mao Zedong, the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance, and Mutual Assistance and various agreements were officially signed on February 14. From then on, Sino-Soviet friendly cooperation entered a new era. This will play a great role in consolidating the victory of the Chinese people, combating the war conspiracies of American imperialism, and consolidating world peace. This will be a major boost to the construction of New China, especially in the recovery and development of the economy. The Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance, and Mutual Assistance and agreements, and the permanent friendly cooperation between the peoples of China and the Soviet Union, are undoubtedly in the most fundamental interests of the Chinese farmers, who are the most populous and suffered the most from the devastation of Japanese invaders and Chiang bandits.

　　In order to celebrate the brotherly alliance between China and the Soviet Union, first of all, it is hoped that farmers' organizations and rural workers throughout the country will deeply publicize the significance of Sino-Soviet friendly cooperation. Let us, the Chinese farmers, unite closely under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the working class, and work together with other democratic classes and all patriotic people to resolutely support and implement the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance, and Mutual Assistance and other agreements, prevent the resurgence of Japanese imperialist aggression, thoroughly eliminate the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, and liberate all of China. Secondly, through the organization of farmers, under the leadership of the Central People's Government and the Chinese Communist Party, complete land reform step by step on a national scale, thoroughly transform the district and village administrations in the newly liberated areas, consolidate the people's democratic dictatorship, and strengthen the great unity of the people from all walks of life. Thirdly, we must strive to produce and tide over famine, economize on disaster relief, rely on the organization of farmers themselves, cooperate and help each other, rely on our own hard work, meticulous farming, and strive to achieve the tasks of agricultural production in 1950 set by the Ministry of Agriculture of the Central People's Government, and strive to achieve the task of increasing national grain production by 10 billion catties and increasing cotton production by 4.7 million dan.

　　用我们的行动来拥护中苏友好同盟互助条约
    杨耕田
    当解放战争接近全国胜利，中华人民共和国成立后的第一个春节到来的时候，中苏两大兄弟国家，缔结了友好同盟互助条约和关于中国长春铁路、旅顺口、大连及贷款等协定。这真是双喜临门。华北农民和全中国农民跟全国各地工人兄弟及其他各界人民一样，莫不兴高采烈地欢呼庆祝。
    在八年抗日战争、三年多解放战争中，中国四万万农民和广大农村受到日本帝国主义和美帝国主义的走狗蒋介石匪帮的灾害最深。我们为了生存，在中国共产党领导之下，在人民解放军英勇作战之下，尽了自己最大的力量，支援解放战争直到获得最后胜利。根据我们历来的切身经验，深刻理解苏联是我们最可靠的朋友。他曾经从各方面给了中国人民以最大的道义和物质的支援，而在中华人民共和国成立之后，苏联又是第一个和我们建立邦交的兄弟国家。
    由于斯大林大元帅和毛泽东主席的英明决策，中苏友好同盟互助条约和各项协定，在二月十四日正式签订了。从此中苏友好合作进入了新时代。这将对于巩固中国人民的胜利、打击美帝国主义的战争阴谋和巩固世界和平起着伟大作用。这将对新中国的建设，特别是经济方面的恢复及发展，是一个重大的助力。中苏友好同盟互助条约和协定、中苏两国人民的永久友好合作，无疑的对于人口最多受到日寇和蒋匪摧残最深的中国农民是最根本的利益。
    为了庆祝中苏两国的兄弟同盟，首先希望全国各地农民团体和农村工作者，深入宣传中苏友好合作的意义。让我们全中国的农民同胞，紧紧地团结起来，在中国共产党和工人阶级领导之下，和其他民主阶级及一切爱国人士，一致努力，坚决拥护与实现中苏友好同盟互助条约及其他协定，制止日本帝国主义的再起侵略，彻底消灭蒋介石匪帮，解放全中国。其次，经过农民同胞的组织起来，在中央人民政府和中国共产党领导之下，在全国范围内，有步骤地完成土地改革，并彻底改造新解放区的区村政权，巩固人民民主专政，增强各界人民的大团结。第三就是要努力生产渡荒，节约救灾，依靠农民自己的组织起来，合作互助，依靠自己的辛勤刻苦，精耕细作，务求实现中央人民政府农业部关于一九五○年农业生产的任务，为实现全国增产粮食一百亿斤，增产棉花四百七十万担的任务而努力。
