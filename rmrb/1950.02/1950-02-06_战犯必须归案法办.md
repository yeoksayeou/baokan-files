　　War Criminals Must Be Brought to Justice

　　Yesterday's publication of the Soviet government's note demanded the swift trial of Japanese germ warfare criminals Hirohito, Ishii, Kitano, Wakamatsu, Kasahara, and others. This demand completely aligns with the will of the Chinese people. As early as last December, when the Soviet Maritime Territory Military Tribunal tried twelve Japanese germ warfare criminals and sentenced them to imprisonment, the Chinese people had already expressed warm support for this just action by the Soviet government and hoped that all criminals who had not yet been tried could be swiftly brought to justice.

　　For half a century, Japanese imperialism ran rampant in the Far East, and the Chinese people were the first to suffer its calamity. Millions of peaceful residents endured cruel poisoning, a blood debt that the Chinese people can never forget. The confessions of germ warfare criminals Yamada, Kawashima, Tang Ze, and others have further exposed the bloody crimes of Japanese imperialism in our country. They used our Northeast as a base for preparing germ warfare, established germ warfare factories to kill people, used living people for inhumane freezing experiments, and spread plague germs in Changde, Hunan, and the lower reaches of the Yangtze River in 1941 and 1942. These bestial acts, which completely extinguished humanity and violated international law, must be severely punished in order to uphold human justice and safeguard world security.

　　However, insane American imperialist elements, in order to prepare for new wars of aggression, have deliberately condoned the heinous Japanese war criminals who invaded China, and even released those who had already been arrested. For example, Commander-in-Chief of the former Japanese Army in China, Okamura Yasuji; former head of the Japanese Navy Intelligence System in China, Kodama Yoshio; former Japanese ambassador to the puppet Nanjing regime, Tani Masanori; and former president of the South Manchuria Railway, Ayukawa Yoshisuke, are all at large. As for Hirohito, the number one criminal in the Japanese war of aggression against China and the germ warfare, he has not only not been arrested and tried, but has also been treated with courtesy by the American occupation forces and remains the Emperor of Japan to this day. Other germ warfare criminals, except for those who have been tried by the Soviet Union, have not been punished in any way. The Chinese people can never tolerate this absurd and dangerous situation. The Chinese people firmly support the just demands of the Soviet government, demanding the swift trial of germ warfare criminals Hirohito, Ishii, Kitano, Wakamatsu, Kasahara, and others, and demanding the trial of all Japanese war criminals who have not received their due punishment.

　　The just demand for the trial of Japanese germ warfare criminals not only meets the interests of the Chinese people, but also meets the interests of the people of the world. Today, in the imperialist camp headed by the United States, warmongers are carrying out various war preparations, including preparations for atomic warfare and germ warfare, and they are attempting to use Japan as a base for carrying out aggression. Our trial of important Japanese war criminals will simultaneously warn all warmongers, strike at their vicious conspiracies, and benefit world peace and the welfare of mankind.

### 战犯必须归案法办

　　战犯必须归案法办
    昨日本报所发表的苏联政府照会，提出了迅速审判日本细菌战争罪犯裕仁、石井、北野、若松、笠原等人的要求。这个要求，完全符合于中国人民的意志。还在去年十二月苏联滨海区军事法庭审讯十二名日本细菌战犯并判处徒刑的时候，中国人民就已经表示热烈拥护苏联政府的这一正义行为，并希望一切尚未受审的罪犯能够迅速归案法办。
    日本帝国主义半世纪来横行远东，我中国人民首蒙其祸，千百万和平居民受尽残酷的毒害，这一笔血海深仇，是我们中国人民时时刻刻不能忘记的。这次细菌战犯山田、川岛、唐泽等的供词中，进一步暴露了日本帝国主义在我国的血腥罪行。他们把我们东北作为准备细菌战争的基地，建立细菌杀人工厂，用活人作惨无人道的冰冻实验，并曾于一九四一年及一九四二年，在我国湖南常德和长江下游，散布鼠疫毒菌。这种完全灭绝人道、违反国际公法的兽行，必须加以严厉的惩办，才能伸张人类的正义，保障世界的安全。
    但是丧心病狂的美国帝国主义分子，为了准备新的侵略战争，竟不惜对罪恶滔天的日本侵华战犯故意宽纵，甚至已经逮捕的也被释放。例如前日寇中国派遣军总司令冈村宁次，前日寇侵华海军系统特务头子儿玉誉志夫，前日寇驻伪宁大使谷正之，前日寇满洲重工业会社总裁鲇川义介等首要战犯，现在都逍遥法外。至于日本侵华战争和细菌战争的第一名罪犯裕仁，不但未被逮捕审判，而且还被美国占领军所优礼，至今仍然是日本的天皇。其他细菌战犯，除已由苏联审判者外，也没有受到任何惩罚。中国人民决不能容忍这种悖谬的和危险的情况。中国人民坚决支持苏联政府的正义主张，要求迅速审判裕仁、石井、北野、若松、笠原等细菌战犯，并要求审判一切未受应得惩处的日本战争罪犯。
    审判日本细菌战争罪犯的正义要求，不仅符合中国人民的利益，而且也符合世界人民的利益。今天在以美国为首的帝国主义阵营内，好战分子正在进行各种战争准备，包括原子战争与细菌战争的准备，他们并企图把日本作为其进行侵略的基地。我们对于日本重要战犯的审讯，将同时警告一切好战分子，打击他们的毒辣阴谋，而有利于世界和平与人类的福利。
