The Second World War interrupted the 1937-1938 economic crisis in the United States, Britain, France and other countries, opening up vast sales markets for resources such as weapons, munitions and food.

During the Second World War, the United States seized many new foreign markets by partially or completely squeezing out other powers (for example, the share of U.S. exports to Latin American countries increased from 32 percent in 1935 to 57 percent in 1944, while Britain's share fell from 15 percent to 3.5 percent during the same period). The Lend-Lease Act also contributed to the surge in U.S. exports.

War instigators have tried their best to praise the U.S. wartime economy, regarding the state's wartime economic "adjustment" as evidence of the progressiveness of U.S. capitalism. However, this is completely inconsistent with reality. During the war, the increase in U.S. production occurred on a parasitic basis, in a form that is sufficient to prove the decadence of U.S. capitalism.

The leap in U.S. production standards was caused by the massive expansion of the manufacture of instruments of destruction, and also by the massive destruction of the productive forces of European and Asian capitalist countries. The growth of U.S. production to such a remarkable extent relied on maximizing the use of productive forces, which had suffered from chronic underutilization in peacetime.

Along with the massive increase in production for war purposes came a reduction in the production of civilian goods in the United States.

The war brought huge profits to monopoly capitalists, further strengthened social inequality and class contradictions, and deepened the gap between expanding production possibilities and narrow markets and the limited and meager living standards of the working masses.

At the end of the Second World War, the United States and other imperialist countries preserved huge armed forces and powerful wartime industries, preparing for new wars. Military spending in the United States, Britain and France in the years after the war was several times higher than before the war.

However, after the end of the war, the need for weapons, munitions and food sharply decreased, causing a large decline in U.S. industrial production in 1945-1946. General industrial production in 1946 was about one-third lower than in 1943. The decline in U.S. industrial production led to an increase in mass unemployment, a reduction in wages, a sharpening of contradictions between the bourgeoisie and the proletariat, and a rise in domestic strike movements.

In mid-1946, the United States began some revitalization of production. In 1948, some industrial sectors (petroleum, electricity, trucks, construction, etc.) reached or even exceeded wartime highs. However, most industrial sectors were far from reaching wartime highs, and throughout the post-war period, production in some important sectors continued to decline. For example, machine-made products accounted for 54 percent of 1943 (wartime high) in 1946, but only reached 63 percent of that level in 1948. The output of machine tools decreased from $1.32 billion in 1942 to $326 million in 1946, and further decreased to $283 million in 1948. The construction of merchant ships (gross tonnage from 2,000 tons to more than 2,000 tons) decreased from 12,551,000 tons in 1943 to 646,000 tons in 1946, and further decreased to 140,000 tons in 1948.

According to U.S. statistics, the general index of U.S. industrial production rose to 170 percent of the 1937 level in 1948, but only accounted for 77 percent of the wartime high.

From November 1948, production in all basic industrial sectors in the United States began to shrink. A new economic crisis began in the United States. In terms of its depth and speed of development, this new economic crisis is no less severe than the major crisis of overproduction in the United States in 1929-1933, as it has been demonstrated in the past ten months.

	May... 139.2 87.4
	June... 136.0 85.4
	July... 130.4 81.9

Thus, if production decreased by 13.6 percent in the first nine months of the 1929-1933 economic crisis, production shrank by 18.1 percent in the first nine months of this economic crisis.

Although U.S. monopoly capital groups are taking more measures than ever before to artificially prevent the development of the crisis, the crisis is still growing in the United States. These measures include the following:

	1.	Intensify the armaments of the United States and other capitalist countries. Government expenditures for providing armed forces in most capitalist countries have increased sharply compared to before the war. For example, in the United States, direct military expenses alone (expenditures for the Navy, Army and Air Force) increased from $140 million in 1938-39 to $1.46 billion in 1949-50, an increase of tenfold. In addition, there are the expenses required for the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission's budget, the expenses required for storing military raw materials, the expenses required for occupying Germany, Africa and Japan, and the expenses required according to the "Marshall Plan" and the North Atlantic Treaty, etc. The total amount of military expenses required by the United States exceeds $30 billion. No less than half of the direct military expenditures are used for military industrial orders, thereby artificially blocking the decline in production. In the United States and other capitalist countries, in addition to the state's military expenditures, there are also private investments in military enterprises.

	2.	Use huge amounts of state expenditures to subsidize exports by providing loans and "aid" to other capitalist countries. This expenditure has delayed and continues to delay the decline in U.S. exports.

	3.	Large amounts of state expenditure are used for the construction of military facilities, roads, hydroelectric power stations, and other projects - some construction is aimed at reducing increasing unemployment.

In all capitalist countries, these expenses have increased the state budget deficit, increased the burden of people's taxes, and promoted inflation. Inflation has increased the profits of monopoly capital and hindered the increase in bankruptcies of capitalist enterprises.

All of these "policies" have increased the tax burden on workers, reduced real wages, and reduced the purchasing power of the broad masses of people, thereby naturally reducing the sales of personal consumer goods.

The characteristics of the current crisis in the United States lie first in the sharp decline in the production of consumer goods. For example, cotton modification decreased by 23 percent in the first seven months of 1949 compared to the same period in 1948. The production level of the textile industry in July 1949 decreased by 32 percent compared to the highest point in 1948 (February), while the production level of shoes decreased by 13 percent in the first five months of 1949 compared to the highest level in 1948.

The production level of heavy industry has also dropped sharply. For example, the smelting industry decreased by 20 percent from March to August 1949. The production of trucks decreased from 713,000 vehicles in the first half of 1948 to 632,000 vehicles in the first half of 1949, a decrease of 11 percent. In May 1949, the production index of non-ferrous metals and their finished products decreased by 25 percent compared to the index in May 1948. The output of bituminous coal in the United States decreased by 18.1 percent in the first eight months of 1949 compared to the same period in 1948.

U.S. exports reached a post-war high in 1947. In 1948, it decreased slightly compared to 1947, decreasing by 17.8 percent in monetary terms and 22.9 percent in physical volume; in the first seven months of 1949, it decreased by 19 percent in monetary terms compared to the same period in 1947, and in terms of physical volume, it decreased by 20 percent in the first five months of 1949 compared to the same period in 1948.

Although monopoly capital is desperately trying to maintain high prices, wholesale prices have dropped significantly. For example, the price of cotton fabrics decreased by 15 to 20 percent in mid-1948, and the price of certain types of wool fabrics decreased by 30 to 40 percent. From January to the end of August 1949, the price of electrolytic copper decreased by 25 percent, zinc by 43 percent, and lead by 30 percent. The price of steel sheets in the first quarter of 1949 decreased by more than 40 percent, and by July 1949 it fell to 50 percent of the average price in 1948.

The people's purchasing power is decreasing more and more, which has resulted in a reduction in retail sales of goods. In February 1949, department store sales decreased by 5 percent compared to February 1948 (calculated at current prices), March by 12 percent, and July by 7 percent. Unsold inventories have increased. For example, the inventory of rayon in factories in July 1949 was 291,000 tons, while it was 71,000 tons in December 1948, and 61,000 tons in July 1948.

The scale of construction has also been reduced. The cost of new industrial construction in the first five months of 1949 has already decreased by 20 percent compared to the same period in 1948. The total number of all construction contracts signed in the first half of 1949 was 6 percent less than those signed in the first half of 1948.

A decline in the value of corporate stocks can be seen on the stock exchange. On the New York Stock Exchange, the average price of stocks has fallen to its lowest level compared to January 1945. In the United States, the number of bankruptcies of small and medium-sized enterprises has more than doubled.

The number of unemployed people is increasing rapidly. According to official data over the past year, the number of unemployed has more than doubled from August 1948 to August 1949.

The new economic crisis has begun to engulf the entire capitalist world. Countries directly threatened by the crisis of overproduction include Britain, whose industrial production has long stagnated at levels below those of 1937. Britain is even far behind the 1937 level in many important sectors of industry. For example, in 1948, the production of cotton fabrics in Britain was 48 percent less than in 1937, cotton yarn was 36 percent less, wool products were 16 percent less, and coal production was 13 percent weaker. In the second quarter of 1949, British exports began to decline. In June 1949, it decreased by 10 percent compared to January and March of that year, and by June 1949, British exports to the United States decreased by almost two times compared to 1948. The decrease in exports in many sectors immediately led to a decrease in production. British newspapers pointed out that orders for light machinery manufacturing have shrunk by 50 percent compared to 1948. In 1949, the production of water-powered motorcycles, electrical equipment for living, and radio receivers decreased, and orders for shipbuilding and agricultural machinery also decreased. In August 1949, some textile enterprises in Lancashire closed down due to lack of orders. In June, the market showed a decrease in demand for steel.

In the first few months of 1949, the index of Italian industrial production was almost the same as the level in the same period in 1948, but it was greatly lower than in 1937. The products of the machine industry and the iron and steel industry decreased significantly in the first quarter of 1949 compared to the first quarter of 1948. The production of Italy's construction industry, chemical industry and forestry also declined.

In 1948, French industrial production had returned to the 1937 production level, but it was 28 percent lower than the 1929 level. From the second half of 1948, the strengthening of war preparations was manifested in French industry - the increase in U.S. military orders increased the industrial burden. At the same time, the production of industries such as aircraft manufacturing, shipbuilding, and film industries tended to shrink. Various kinds of mass-produced necessities piled up a lot of inventory. Sales in the shoe and textile industries encountered particularly significant difficulties.

In Belgium, the amount of coal stored is increasing month by month, but its extraction volume is 12 percent lower than before the war. Belgian coal has been greatly squeezed out of the French market, because the French coal market has coal imported from the United States on the one hand and coal imported from the Ruhr on the other; Belgian coal has also been unable to find sales in the Italian and North African markets.

In 1948, the production of cotton and silk fabrics in Belgium decreased compared to 1947, and textile exports in the fourth quarter of 1948 greatly decreased compared to the first quarter of that year. Belgium's glass industry, perfume industry and other industrial sectors have encountered significant difficulties in sales. In April 1949, the number of unemployed people in Belgium increased by 132 percent compared to April 1948.

The economic crisis of overproduction also directly affects the rural economy of capitalist countries. This primarily refers to the United States and other countries that export the vast majority of their agricultural products abroad.

The following situations promote the approach of the agricultural crisis:

	1.	The decline in the purchasing power of the working masses in capitalist countries;

	2.	The expansion of agricultural production in the United States and some countries across the Atlantic from 1940 to 1948 (for example, the sown area of grains in the United States was 7.6 percent more in 1948 than the average between 1934 and 1938, and 8.5 percent more in 1949, while the figures for wheat were 29.7 percent more in 1948 and 36.1 percent more in 1949);

	3.	The partial recovery of the agricultural economies of capitalist European countries and good harvests, many of which were harvested in 1948 (in seventeen European capitalist countries, the harvest of wheat and rye in 1948 was 31.3 million tons, while it was only 21 million tons in 1947, and the average amount during the period of 1934-1938 was 35.5 million tons. It is estimated that the European wheat harvest in 1949 decreased by approximately 5 percent compared to 1948);

	4.	The rise in grain prices, which is the result of the policy pursued by U.S. monopoly capital groups during the war and in the years after the war, which tried to cause famine as much as possible in capitalist countries in Europe and Asia. The price per ton of U.S. wheat rose from $31.90 in 1938 to $103.20 in 1947.

There are many signs that prove the maturation of the agricultural crisis.

The increase in grain inventories. For example, the inventory of wheat in the United States, Canada, Argentina, and Africa, according to preliminary data, was 17.4 million tons on July 1, 1949, while it was only 10.5 million tons on July 1, 1946. The amount of grain stored in the United States has increased particularly rapidly. According to data from the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the amount of excess wheat stored in the United States reached as much as 7.97 million tons on July 1, 1949, while it was only 5.3 million tons on July 1, 1948, and only 2.3 million tons on July 1, 1947.

The increase in cotton inventories. In August 1949, the cotton inventory in the United States was 5.5 million bales more than in August 1947, and 3 million bales more than in August 1948; the decrease in cotton textile industrial products, first in the United States and then in many other capitalist countries, has expanded the overproduction of cotton.

The prices of agricultural products began to decline. In July 1949, the prices of agricultural products in the United States decreased compared to July 1948: wheat decreased by 6.2 percent, corn by 30.5 percent, and cotton by 5.5 percent. In August and September, the price of wheat rose slightly, but it was still lower than the same period in 1948, and the prices of corn and cotton also fell. This decline in prices is particularly noteworthy because it occurred despite the resistance of monopoly capitalists and despite the many measures taken by the government in an attempt to maintain prices at a high level.

The decrease in land prices. The price index per acre in the United States reached the 1920 level in 1947 (the highest limit before the war). The decrease in agricultural product prices has caused land to depreciate (a drop of 10 percent in the first half of 1949). Due to the maturation of the agricultural crisis, the need for land has also decreased.

The economic instability of capitalist countries is clearly manifested in the state of world trade. The actual volume of world exports (excluding the Soviet Union and people's democratic countries) was 12 percent less in 1948 than in 1929, and 9 percent less than in 1937. In 1949, the volume of world trade continued to shrink. The proportion of individual countries in world trade is constantly changing. The imbalance of development in various countries has become more intense, which has strengthened the struggle between countries for markets.

The reduction in world trade of capitalist countries in the post-war period is related to the separation of the people's democratic countries from the capitalist sphere, and the imperialists are implementing discriminatory policies towards these countries. The shrinking sales markets of imperialist powers are also due to the fact that colonial and semi-colonial countries are full of national liberation movements, and some of these countries have established people's democratic systems (China, North Korea, Vietnam).

The aggressive policy of U.S. imperialism is one of the main reasons for market instability. Under the guise of "aid" to Western European countries, U.S. imperialism has plundered their domestic and foreign markets, destroyed their economic foundations, and increasingly forced them to be subject to its economic and political influence. U.S. monopoly capital strives to develop its commodity exports to the highest limit, while restricting the import of foreign commodities into its own country. As a result, the United States has a huge trade surplus and the world is experiencing a dollar shortage. Between 1946 and 1948, according to U.S. statistics (including the trade surplus for transportation), the U.S. trade surplus reached $24.7 billion, while the trade surplus between 1936 and 1938 was only $1.02 billion. The surplus in the U.S. balance of international payments is also increasing strongly. The United States uses other countries' dollar shortages to bind other capitalist countries with loans and "aid" with enslaving conditions. On the basis of the "Marshall Plan," U.S. capitalists flooded the markets of Western European countries with large quantities of commodities, while extracting large profits; moreover, according to the conditions of the "Marshall Plan," the United States exported consumer goods to Western European countries, rather than equipment or machinery. At the same time, the United States used the "Marshall Plan" to destroy many industrial sectors in Western European countries. All of this has brought great harm to the economies of Western European countries, leading them to production shrinkage, increased unemployment, and deepening poverty of the working masses. This policy has sharpened the contradictions between the capitalist countries of Western Europe and the imperialist United States, and strengthened the internal contradictions within capitalist countries in Europe. U.S. taxpayers pay for the vast majority of U.S. export goods, extracting tens of billions from them to subsidize exports and pay for the "Marshall Plan" and the funds needed for U.S. expansion policies. Such policies have reduced the purchasing power of workers and promoted the development of the U.S. economic crisis.

In all capitalist countries, the new economic crisis broke out under conditions of extreme financial instability. The inflation that already existed in capitalist countries during the war years has not only not been alleviated in the post-war period, but has become more severe in all capitalist countries, and in many capitalist countries, inflation has reached an extremely serious degree. The high prices in capitalist countries prove the growth of inflation, and also reflect the price inflation policy of monopoly capital groups.

Even according to such false data, the purchasing power of the dollar has decreased by almost two times compared to the pre-war period, the pound by more than two times, the franc by twenty times, the lira by fifty-seven times, and the yen by one hundred and eighty-three times. In all capitalist countries, the purchasing power of currency in 1949 was greatly lower than at the end of the war. The currency price expressed in retail prices is even lower. This situation is obscured in some countries by artificially raising the official price of currency to a level much higher than the black market price.

After the Second World War, many capitalist countries implemented currency devaluation, and some countries devalued several times. For example, France—five times, Greece—five times (from 1944), etc.

In September 1949, capitalist countries entered a new stage of currency devaluation. Following the devaluation of the British pound on September 18, 1949, another twenty-four capitalist countries followed suit and implemented currency devaluation, including all the dominions of the British Empire (except Pakistan), as well as Egypt, Ireland, Burma, and almost all Marshall Plan-ized countries. Under the oppression of the United States, which aimed at strengthening economic expansion, the currency devaluation of capitalist countries reached 30 percent, which is a further blow to the economic situation and living standards of the working masses in those countries. Currency devaluation has further sharpened the contradictions between capitalist countries.

In all countries, monopoly capitalists widely use inflation as a means to strengthen the exploitation of the working class, reduce their real wages, deprive small property owners, and concentrate capital. The price inflation policy adopted by monopoly capital is also aimed at plundering the people of other countries; they are forced to accept high-priced British and American goods.

The inflation and foreign exchange policies pursued by bourgeois countries, as well as the dollar shortage caused by U.S. policies (the purpose of this policy in the United States is to fully strengthen exports without correspondingly expanding imports), have further damaged international economic relations and caused the growth of contradictions between imperialist powers.

Monopoly capitalist groups, regardless of the growth of the crisis, have been able to maintain profits at a high level with the help of inflation. U.S. corporate profits (after paying taxes) grew to $21.2 billion in 1948, while it was $19.1 billion in 1947, $8.6 billion between 1939 and 1945 (average profit during the war), and $2.9 billion between 1934 and 1938 (average profit in the five years before the war). The profits of monopoly capital in the first quarter of 1949 were 10 percent higher than in the first quarter of 1948.

British corporate profits reached 1.684 billion pounds in 1947, 1.945 billion pounds in 1948, and 763 million pounds in 1938. According to the lowest estimates and untruthful British statistics, the proportion of profits obtained by British monopoly capital in the national income increased from 11.7 percent in 1938 to 17 percent in 1948. The profits of corporate companies in the second quarter of 1949 increased by 15 percent compared to the same period in 1948.

At the same time, the situation of the working class in capitalist countries is deteriorating. The real wages (average) of U.S. workers in April 1949 were 16 percent lower than in 1943, while the total amount of wage payments in the manufacturing industry actually decreased by 28 percent during the same period. In fact, the real wages in the United States have decreased even more, because the direct taxes collected from workers and staff have greatly increased.

According to data from Communist newspapers, the real wages of British workers in 1948 were greatly lower than in the crisis-stricken year of 1938.

The living standards of West German workers are 44 percent lower than in the pre-war year of 1938. There are 1.3 million unemployed workers in the three occupation zones, which means that they account for 10 percent of all employees. In some areas, such as Schleswig-Holstein, the number of unemployed people accounts for 21 percent of all employees.

The real wages in Japan in 1948 were 55 percent lower than between 1934 and 1936. According to Japanese official statistics (only counting unemployed people who receive government relief), there were 310,000 unemployed people in the country at the beginning of 1949. However, this figure completely fails to reflect the true scale of unemployment. According to data from the "Japan Times" supplement (October 15, 1948), the number of unemployed and semi-employed workers in Japan in 1948 was 4 million to 5 million. In addition, there are a large number of unemployed people among agricultural proletarians and semi-proletarians, coolies, and rickshaw pullers in Japan.

The growth of the economic crisis, the arms race, and the currency devaluation implemented by European capitalist countries have contributed to the further impoverishment of the working masses.

× × × ×

The growing economic crisis is throwing capitalist countries, especially the imperialist fortress—the United States—far behind. In the Soviet Union and people's democratic countries, industrial and agricultural production is constantly growing, and the welfare of workers is constantly improving.

As a result of the vigorous economic growth of the Soviet Union and people's democratic countries, the balance of power between the democratic camp and the imperialist camp has long been transformed in favor of the anti-imperialist camp. As time progresses, the new economic crisis further damages the economic position of the imperialist anti-democratic camp. This new economic crisis, which began in the United States, threatens the entire capitalist world.

　　资本主义各国经济危机的发展
    （里昂尼多夫著  崔平译）
    第二次世界大战中断了美、英、法和其他国家的一九三七——一九三八年的经济危机，为武器、军火和食粮等资源开辟了广大销售市场。
    第二次世界大战期间，美国用部分或全部地排挤其他列强的方法，侵占了许多新的国外市场（例如美国对拉丁美洲诸国输出所占的份额从一九三五年的百分之三十二扩大到一九四四年的百分之五十七，同时，英国在同一时期所占的份额却从百分之十五降落到百分之三·五）。租借政策也是促成美国输出激增的原因。
    战争挑拨者尽力赞扬美国的战时经济，把国家战时的经济“调节”看做美国资本主义进步性的证据。但是，这是完全不符合实际的。战时，美国生产的增加是在寄生的基础上发生的，在那种形式上，正足以证明美国资本主义的腐朽性。
    美国生产水准的跃进是制造破坏工具的大量膨胀所造成的，也是欧亚资本主义诸国生产力的大量毁灭所造成的。美国的生产品增长到这样值得注意的程度是靠了尽量利用生产力，那些生产力曾在和平时期患过慢性负荷不足。
    随着用于战争目的的生产的大量增加以俱来的是美国民用物品生产的缩减。
    战争给独占资本家带来了巨额利润，更加强了社会的不平等和阶级矛盾，加深了正在扩张的生产可能性与狭窄的市场和劳动大众有限的低微的生活水准之间的裂痕。
    第二次世界大战结束时，美国和其他帝国主义国家保存了巨大的武装力量和有力的战时工业，进行准备新的战争。美英法在战后数年内的军费比战前多好几倍。
    但是战争结束以后，对武器、军火和食粮的需要锐减，引起了一九四五——一九四六年美国工业生产的大大减退。一般的工业生产量在一九四六年比一九四三年减低了三分之一左右。美国工业生产的减退带来了大众失业的增加，工资的减少，资产阶级和无产阶级间矛盾的尖锐化，并引起国内罢工运动的高涨。
    一九四六年中期，美国开始了生产的某些活跃。一九四八年，某些工业部门（石油、电力、载重汽车、建筑事业等）达到了甚至超过了战时最高额。但是大多数的工业部门，还远没有达到战时最高额，而在整个战后期间，某些重要部门的生产却在继续减退。例如，机器制造的产品在一九四六年占一九四三年（战时最高额）的百分之五四，而在一九四八年只达这一水准的百分之六三。母机的出产从一九四二年的十三亿二千万美元减低到一九四六年的三亿二千六百万美元，而一九四八年更减低到二亿八千三百万美元。商船的建造（总吨数从二千吨到二千吨以上的）从一九四三年的一千二百五十五万一千吨减少到一九四六年的六十四万六千吨，而一九四八年更减少到十四万吨。
    根据美国的统计资料，一九四八年美国工业生产的一般指数上升到一九三七年水准的百分之一百七十，然而只占战时最高额的百分之七十七。
    从一九四八年的十一月，美国一切基本工业部门的生产都开始缩减了。在美国开始了新的经济危机。就其发展的深度和速度来说，像过去十个月里所表现的，这一次新的经济危机并不逊于一九二九——一九三三年美国生产过剩时的重大危机。

    这样看来，假如说一九二九——一九三三年经济危机的头九个月里生产减低了百分之十三·六的话，这一次经济危机的头九个月里，生产缩减了百分之十八·一。
    虽然美国的独占资本集团比以前任何时更多地采取人工阻止危机发展的措施，可是危机在美国还是在增长着。这类措施有如下的几种：
    １．加紧美国和其他资本主义国家的军备。大多数资本主义国家供给武装力量的政府支出比战前锐增了。例如，在美国，仅只是直接的军事费用（海陆空军的支出）就从一九三八——三九年的一亿四千万美元增加到一九四九——五○年的十四亿六千万美元，也就是说增加了十倍。此外，还有美国原子弹委员会的预算所需的费用，储备军用原料所需的费用，占领德国、非洲和日本所需的费用，依据“马歇尔计划”和北大西洋公约等等所需的费用。美国军事费用所需的总额超过了三十亿美元。不下于一半的直接军事开支是用在军事工业的定货上，借此来人为地阻挡生产的低落。在美国和其他资本主义诸国中，除了国家的军事开支以外，还有军事企业中的私人投资。
    ２．因供给借款和“帮助”其他资本主义诸国而将巨额的国家支出用于资助输出上。这种支出延缓了而且继续延缓着美国输出的减退。
    ３．大量的国家支出用于军事设施的建设、道路、水力发电站，以及其他工程的建设，——有某些建设是以减少正在增加中的失业为目的的。
    在所有资本主义国家内，这些费用增加了国家预算的赤字，加重了人民捐税的负担，促进了通货膨胀。通货膨胀提高了独占资本的利润，而阻滞了资本主义企业破产的增加。
    所有这些“政策”都使得劳动者的捐税负担加重，实际工资减少，广大人民群众购买力减低，因此，自然也减少了个人消费品的销路。
    美国现时危机的特点，首先在于消费品生产的锐减。例如，棉花改制在一九四九年的头七个月里比一九四八年的同一时期减少了百分之二三。一九四九年七月纺织工业的生产水准比一九四八年的最高点（二月）减低百分之三二，而鞋的生产水准在一九四九年的头五个月里比一九四八年最高水准减少了百分之十三。
    重工业的生产水准也猛烈地降低了。例如，冶炼业从一九四九年三月到八月减少了百分之二○。载重汽车的生产从一九四八年前半年的七十一万三千辆减少到一九四九年前半年的六十三万二千辆，也就是减少了百分之十一。一九四九年五月有色金属及其制成品的生产指数比一九四八年五月的指数减低百分之二十五。美国烟煤的产量在一九四九年头八个月里比一九四八年同一时期减少百分之十八·一。
    一九四七年美国的输出达到战后的最高额。一九四八年就比一九四七年减少了一点，在货币上减少百分之十七·八，在实物容量上减少百分之二二·九；一九四九年头七个月里在货币上比一九四七年同一时期减少了百分之十九，而就实物容量说，一九四九年头五个月里比一九四八年同一时期减少了百分之二十。
    虽然独占资本拼命地企图维持高价，可是批发价格还是大大地降低了。例如，棉织品的价格在一九四八年中期降低百分之十五到二十，而某些种毛织品——百分之三十到四十。从一九四九年一月到八月底，电解铜的价格减低百分之二五，锌—百分之四三，铅—百分之三十。一九四九年第一季钢片的价格降低百分之四十以上，到了一九四九年七月跌到一九四八年平均价格的百分之五十。
    人民的购买力愈来愈降低，其结果减少了商品零售量。一九四九年二月，百货店的售卖额比一九四八年二月（按现在价格计算）减少了百分之五，三月—百分之十二，七月—百分之七。没有卖出去的存货增加了。例如，工场里的人造丝存货在一九四九年七月是二十九万一千吨，而一九四八年十二月是七万一千吨，一九四八年七月是六万一千吨。
    建设的规模也缩减了。新的工业建设的费用在一九四九年头五个月里已经比一九四八年的同一时期减少了百分之二十。全部建筑合同的总数，在一九四九年上半年签订的比一九四八年上半年签订的少了百分之六。
    在证券交易所里可以看到企业股票的跌价。在纽约交易所里，股票的平均价格跟一九四五年一月比，已经降低到它的最低水准。在美国，中小企业的破产数字增加了两倍以上。
    失业者很快地增多起来，根据官方一年来的资料来看，失业的数字，从一九四八年八月到一九四九年八月增加了两倍以上。

    新的经济危机开始把整个资本主义世界都卷进去了。受生产过剩的危机之直接威胁的国家，有如英国，它的工业生产早已就停滞在不及一九三七年水准的境地上。英国在工业的许多重要部门里，甚至大大地落后于一九三七年的水准。例如，一九四八年英国棉织品的生产比一九三七年少百分之四十八，棉纱——百分之三十六，羊毛制品——百分之十六，煤产——百分之十三弱。一九四九年第二季，英国的输出开始减少了。一九四九年六月，比当年的一月和三月减少了百分之十，而到了一九四九年六月英国对美国的输出比一九四八年减少了差不多两倍。许多部门输出的减少，立刻引起生产的降低。英国报纸指出轻便机器制造的定货比一九四八年缩减百分之五十。一九四九年，水力旋转摩托，生活上的电气设备以及无线电收音机等的生产都减少了，造船和农业用机器的定货也都减少了。一九四九年八月，兰开夏地方的某些纺织企业因为没有定货而倒闭。六月，市场上显示出对于钢的需求的减少。
    一九四九年头几个月里，意大利工业生产的指数同一九四八年同一时期的水准差不多，然而却比一九三七年大大地降低了。机器工业和冶铁工业的产品，在一九四九年第一季比一九四八年第一季大大地减少了。意大利的建筑业、化学工业和林业的生产也低落了。
    一九四八年法国的工业生产曾经回到一九三七年的生产水准，但是比一九二九年的水准却低了百分之二八。从一九四八年下半年起在法国的工业上表现着战争准备的加强——由于美国的军事定货增加了工业的负荷。同时，像飞机制造业、船舶制造业、电影业以及其他部门的生产却都倾向萎缩。各种部门的大众必需生产品，堆积起了许多存货。鞋和纺织品工业部门的销场，遭遇到特别重大的困难。
    在比利时，煤的贮存量，一个月比一个月地增多，可是它的采掘量却已比战前低了百分之十二。比利时的煤，从法国的市场上大大地被排挤出来了，因为法国的煤市场上，一方面有从美国输入的煤，另一方面有从鲁尔输入的煤；在意大利和北非的市场上，比利时的煤也找不到销路。
    一九四八年比利时的棉织品和丝织品的生产比一九四七年减少了，一九四八年第四季纺织品的出口比当年第一季大为降低。比利时的玻璃业、香水业以及其他的工业部门都遭遇了销路上的重大困难。一九四九年四月，比利时的失业人数比一九四八年四月增加了百分之一三二。
    生产过剩的经济危机也直接影响到资本主义国家的农村经济。这首先是指的美国和其他国家，它们是把自己农产品的绝大部分输出国外去的。
    下面几种情况促进着农业危机的接近：
    １、资本主义国家劳动大众购买力的降低；
    ２、美国和大西洋彼岸的某些国家从一九四○到一九四八年农业生产的扩大（例如，美国的谷物播种面积，在一九四八年比一九三四——一九三八年间的平均数多百分之七·六，在一九四九年则多百分之八·五，而在小麦方面的数字是一九四八年多百分之二九·七，一九四九年多百分之三六·一）；
    ３、资本主义欧洲诸国农业经济的部分恢复和良好的收获，其中很多是在一九四八年收获的（在十七个欧洲资本主义国家中，小麦和裸麦的收获在一九四八年是三千一百三十万吨，而一九四七年仅二千一百万吨，一九三四——一九三八年期间的平均量是三千五百五十万吨。据估计，一九四九年欧洲小麦收获比一九四八年大约降低了百分之五）；
    ４、粮价的上升，这是战时和战后数年内，力图在欧亚资本主义诸国内尽可能造成饥荒的美国垄断资本集团所行政策的结果。美国小麦的每吨价格由一九三八年的三十一元九角涨到了一九四七年的一百零三元二角。
    有许多征候可以证明农业危机的成熟。
    谷物存货的增加。例如，美国、加拿大、阿根廷、非洲的小麦存货，根据初步资料，一九四九年七月一日是一千七百四十万吨，而一九四六年的七月一日仅有一千另五十万吨。美国的谷物存储量增加得特别快。根据美国农业部的资料，美国过多的小麦存储在一九四九年七月一日已达七百九十七万吨之多，而一九四八年七月一日仅有五百三十万吨，一九四七年七月一日则仅二百三十万吨。
    棉花存货的增加。一九四九年八月，美国的棉花存货比一九四七年八月多五百五十万包，比一九四八年八月多三百万包；起初在美国，后来又在许多别的资本主义国家，棉织工业产品的减少，扩大了棉花的生产过剩。
    农产品的价格开始低落。一九四九年七月，美国农产品的价格就比一九四八年七月降低了：小麦降低百分之六·二，玉蜀黍——百分之三○·五，棉花——百分之五·五。到了八月和九月，小麦的价格稍稍涨了一点，可是比一九四八年的同一时期仍要低，玉蜀黍和棉花的价格也是下降。这种价格的下降特别令人注意的是，它是在不顾垄断资本家的抵抗，不顾政府采取许许多多企图把价格维持在高水准的措施的情形下发生的。
    土地价格的降低。每一英亩的价格指数，一九四七年在美国达到一九二○年的水准（战前最高限度）。农产品价格的降低使得土地跌价（一九四九年上半年跌百分之十）。由于农业危机的成熟，对于土地的需要也减低了。×          ×          ×        ×
    资本主义诸国经济的不稳定，很明显地表现在世界贸易的状况上。世界输出的实际容量（苏联和人民民主国家除外）在一九四八年比一九二九年少百分之十二，比一九三七年少百分之九。一九四九年世界贸易的容量继续缩减着。个别国家在世界贸易中的比重不断地变动着。各国发展的不平衡性表现得更加强烈了，它强化了各国争夺市场的斗争。

    战后期间资本主义诸国世界贸易的缩减是和人民民主诸国脱离资本主义范围有关系的，对于这些国家帝国主义者实行着歧视的政策。帝国主义列强销售市场的缩小也由于殖民地和半殖民地国家充满了民族解放运动，而且其中有些国家已建立起了人民民主的制度（中国、北朝鲜、越南）。
    美国帝国主义的侵略政策是市场不稳定的主要原因之一。在“援助”西欧诸国的面貌之下，美国帝国主义掠夺了它们的国内外市场，摧毁了它们的经济基础，并日益迫使它们隶属于自己的经济和政治的影响之下。美国独占资本力图把自己的商品输出发展到最高限度，而同时限制外国商品向自己国内输入。其结果是美国贸易的巨大出超和世界的金元饥荒。在一九四六年——一九四八年间，根据美国的统计资料（包含运输的出超）美国贸易的出超达二百四十七亿美元，而一九三六——一九三八年间则仅出超十亿二千万美元。美国国际收支的出超也是强烈地增加着。美国利用别国的金元饥荒，借奴役条件的借款和“帮助”去束缚别的资本主义国家。在“马歇尔计划”的基础上，美国资本家把大量的商品充斥于西欧各国的市场上，同时榨取大量的利润；而且，根据“马歇尔计划”的条件，美国向西欧诸国输出的是消费品，而不是设备或机器。同时，美国利用“马歇尔计划”摧毁了西欧诸国的许多工业部门。所有这一切，给西欧诸国的经济带来了极大的损害，使它们走向生产萎缩，失业增加，劳动大众的贫穷加深。这一政策，使西欧的资本主义诸国与帝国主义美国之间的矛盾尖锐化，加强了欧洲资本主义诸国内部的矛盾。美国的纳税人支付了美国出口货物的极大部分，从他们身上榨取了数十亿来津贴出口，偿付“马歇尔计划”和美国扩张政策等所需的资金。这样的政策，降低了劳动者的购买力，促进了美国经济危机的展开。

    在一切资本主义诸国内，在金融极不安定的条件之下，新的经济危机爆发了。资本主义诸国在战争几年内就已有的通货膨胀，在战后期间，不但没有减轻，反而在一切资本主义国家内都更加厉害了，而且在好些资本主义国家内，通货膨胀还达到了极严重的程度。资本主义诸国物价的高涨证明了通货膨胀的增长，也正反映出独占资本集团的物价膨胀政策。

    甚至于根据这样一个虚伪的资料，金元的购买力比战前时期减低了差不多二倍，英镑——二倍以上，佛郎——二十倍，里拉——五七倍，日元——一八三倍。在一切资本主义国家内，一九四九年的通货购买力比战争结束时大大地降低了。在零售价格上表现的通货价格更要低。这种情形，在有些国家里，由于人工地把通货官价提高到超过黑市价格很高的水准以上而被模糊了。
    第二次世界大战以后，许多资本主义国家实行了通货贬值，某些国家，竟贬低了好几倍。例如，法国——五倍，希腊——五倍（从一九四四年）等等。
    一九四九年九月，资本主义诸国进入了货币贬值的新阶段。跟着一九四九年九月十八日英镑贬值之后，有另外二十四个资本主义国家也仿效实行了货币贬值，其中包括大英帝国的一切属国（巴基斯坦除外），以及埃及、爱尔兰、缅甸，和几乎一切马歇尔计划化的国家。在以加强经济扩张为目的的美国的压迫之下，资本主义诸国的通货贬值达到百分之三十，这是对那些国家的经济状况和劳动大众的生活水准的进一步的打击。通货贬值更加使资本主义诸国间的矛盾尖锐化了。
    在一切国家内，独占资本家广泛地利用通货膨胀作为加强工人阶级的剥削，降低他们的实际工资，剥夺小有产者和集中资本的一种手段。独占资本的采取物价膨胀政策也是为了掠夺别国人民；他们被迫地接受高价的英美商品。
    资产阶级各国所行的通货膨胀和外汇政策，以及美国政策所引起的金元荒（美国的这种政策，目的是在全力地加强输出，而不相应地扩大输入）更加破坏了国际的经济关系，并引起帝国主义列强矛盾的增长。
    独占资本主义集团，不顾危机的增长，能借通货膨胀之助一直把利润维持在高度水准上。美国的公司利润（支付捐税以后）一九四八年增长到二百一十二亿美元，而一九四七年是一百九十一亿美元，一九三九——一九四五年是八十六亿美元（战争期间的平均利润），一九三四——一九三八年是二十九亿美元（战前五年的平均利润）。一九四九年第一季独占资本的利润比一九四八年第一季高百分之十。
    英国的公司利润在一九四七年达十六亿八千四百万英镑，一九四八年——十九亿四千五百万英镑，而一九三八年是七亿六千三百万英镑。按照最低的估计和不真实的英国统计资料来说，英国独占资本所获的利润在国民收入中所占的比重，从一九三八年的百分之十一·七增加到一九四八年的百分之十七。一九四九年第二季企业公司的利润比一九四八年同一时期增加了百分之十五。
    同时，资本主义诸国工人阶级的情况是更加恶化了。美国工人的实际工资（平均的）在一九四九年四月比一九四三年减低了百分之十六，而制造工业里工资支付的总数在同一时期内实际减少了百分之二十八。事实上，美国的实际工资降低的更多，因为从工人和职员身上所收取的直接税是大大地增高了。
    根据共产党报章的资料，英国工人的实际工资在一九四八年比在危机中的一九三八年是大大地降低了。
    西德工人的生活水准，比战前一九三八年减低百分之四十四。在三国占领区计有一百三十万失业工人，也就是说占全部职工的百分之十。在某些地区，如像什列斯威、戈什契尼失业人数占全部职工的百分之二十一。
    日本的实际工资在一九四八年比一九三四——一九三六年间低百分之五十五。根据日本的官方统计（只计及收到政府救济金的失业者），在一九四九年初，全国计有三十一万失业者。但是这一个数字，完全不能反映真实的失业规模，根据“日本时报”副刊（一九四八年十月十五日）的资料，一九四八年的日本的失业和半失业工人为四百万到五百万人。此外，在日本的农业无产者和半无产者，苦力，人力车夫中，还有大量的失业者。
    经济危机的增长，军备的竞赛，和欧洲资本主义各国所实行的货币贬值，促成了劳动大众进一步的贫穷化。
    ×          ×           ×        ×
    增长着的经济危机把资本主义各国，首先是帝国主义的堡垒——美国，远远地抛落在后面了。而在苏联和各人民民主国家内工业和农业的生产在不断地增长着，劳动者的福利在不断地提高着。
    由于苏联和人民民主国家经济蓬勃增长的结果，民主阵营与帝国主义阵营之间的力量对比，已经早就转变为有利于反帝国主义的阵营了。跟着时间的进展，新的经济危机更加损毁了帝国主义的反民主阵营的经济地位。开始于美国的这种新经济危机威胁着整个资本主义世界。
