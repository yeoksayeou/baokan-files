Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 9th: The People's Guerrillas in North Gyeongsang Province, South Korea, inflicted severe blows on the invading Syngman Rhee puppet army in two battles in January. On the evening of January 2nd, the People's Guerrillas, equipped with heavy weapons such as mortars and heavy machine guns, counterattacked five companies of the puppet National Defense Forces' 22nd Regiment, which were conducting "suppression" operations, between the Gyeongju County Jian'gu District and Jiangxi area. After three hours of fierce fighting, more than 80 enemies were annihilated, and together with the guerrillas from Yeongcheon County who arrived behind enemy lines, they flanked the puppet army, forming a counter-encirclement. In this campaign from the 2nd to the 5th, the guerrillas annihilated more than 130 officers and soldiers of the puppet army's 22nd Regiment and wounded more than 10.

On January 26th, the puppet army headquarters stationed in Andong County, North Gyeongsang Province, dispatched a "joint suppression team" of two battalions from the puppet army's 25th Regiment and 16th Regiment to "encircle and suppress" the People's Guerrillas active in the Yeongdeok County area. The People's Guerrillas concentrated a force of 500 men and, with the active support of the local people, lured the enemy's main force to the valley area where Yeongdeok County and Yeongyang County meet, and concentrated their fire. After nine hours of combat, they completely annihilated one battalion and one company belonging to the puppet army's 15th Regiment. One enemy company was forced to surrender.
