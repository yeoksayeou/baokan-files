Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, February 16th: TASS Moscow, February 16th: Today, Pravda published an editorial entitled "Long Live Sino-Soviet Friendship!", the full text of which is as follows:

　　The Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance between the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China, the Agreement on the Chinese Changchun Railway, Port Arthur, and Dalian, and the Agreement on the Soviet Government Granting Long-Term Economic Loans to the People's Republic of China were signed in the Kremlin on February 14th and published in Pravda yesterday. These Treaties and Agreements mark a new era in the development and consolidation of friendship between the peoples of the Soviet Union and China, mark a new stage in the development of international relations, and are a major contribution to the cause of consolidating world peace and democracy. These published documents demonstrate the results of the negotiations conducted in Moscow. Participating in the negotiations on the Soviet side were Comrade Joseph Stalin, Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, and Andrei Vyshinsky, Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Soviet Union. On the Chinese side were Mao Zedong, Chairman of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China, and Zhou Enlai, Premier and Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Government Administration Council of the People's Republic of China. As a result of the negotiations and the signing of the Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance, and the Agreement on the Chinese Changchun Railway, the Ministers of Foreign Affairs of the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China exchanged notes, declaring that the Sino-Soviet Treaty concluded on August 14, 1945, and the Agreement on the Chinese Changchun Railway, have lost their validity. Furthermore, both governments confirmed that the independence of the Mongolian People's Republic has been fully guaranteed due to the plebiscite of 1945, and the People's Republic of China has already established diplomatic relations with the Mongolian People's Republic.

　　The signed documents confirm the historical ties between the peoples of the Soviet Union and China and guarantee the further development of the profound and lasting friendship between the peoples of the Soviet Union and China. The immense importance of these documents cannot be overstated.

　　The greatness of the Stalinist principles of Soviet foreign policy is vividly expressed in these documents. These documents also reflect the fundamental changes that have taken place in the Far East since 1945.

　　The Soviet Union has consistently followed the great sympathy with which it has regarded the Chinese people and their tenacious struggle for national independence to free themselves from the shackles of feudalism and imperialism. As early as 1925, Comrade Stalin said that the strength of the Chinese revolutionary movement is immeasurable. They have not yet fully manifested themselves. In the future, they will manifest themselves. The rulers of the East and the West who cannot see these forces and do not give them due consideration will pay the price for this… Here, truth and justice are entirely on the side of the Chinese revolution. That is why we sympathize with the Chinese revolution, with the Chinese people's struggle for liberation from the shackles of imperialism, and for the unification of China into a unified country, now and in the future.

　　The broad masses of the Chinese people have consistently regarded the Soviet Union as their strong, reliable, and loyal friend. The Great October Revolution, which marked a fundamental turning point in human world history, also opened a new stage in the development of China. The great and immortal ideas of Lenin and Stalin inspired the Chinese working people to fight to break free from the chains of colonial and imperialist enslavement.

　　The Chinese people see that the Soviet Union has shown China an attitude that is fundamentally and principally different from that of capitalist countries. From the very beginning, the Soviet Government announced the abolition of "all secret agreements concluded with Japan, China, and the former Allies, which the Tsarist Government and its allies used to threaten, lure, and enslave the people of the East, and mainly the Chinese people…" (excerpt from the Declaration of the Council of People's Commissars to the Chinese People and the Governments of Southern and Northern China on July 25, 1919).

　　The best of the Chinese people, true Chinese patriots, have clearly understood that only through friendship and alliance with the great Soviet people can the Chinese people guarantee their freedom and independence. In his deathbed letter to the Central Executive Committee of the Soviet Union on March 11, 1925, Sun Yat-sen wrote: “Dear Comrades: As I bid farewell to you, I wish to express my fervent hope that the dawn is not far off when the Soviet Union will welcome a strong and independent China as a good friend and ally! The two countries will join hands in the great battle for the freedom of the oppressed peoples of the world to achieve victory.”

　　Today, the day of liberation for the Chinese people has arrived. The Chinese people have achieved a historically significant victory, thoroughly defeating the corrupt Kuomintang regime and breaking free from the shackles of imperialism. The glorious Communist Party of China, led by Mao Zedong, the leader of the Chinese people, is the inspirer and organizer of the national liberation struggle and the history-making victory of the Chinese people. The decisive victory of the Chinese people was made possible by the Soviet Union under the leadership of the great Stalin, which played a decisive role in defeating German fascism and Japanese imperialism.

　　The Chinese people have become masters of their own destiny and have their glorious place in the camp fighting for peace, democracy, and socialism. Mao Zedong said: "The great peoples of China and the Soviet Union are united by deep and lasting friendship."

　　For the first time in history, the Chinese people have gained true independence, freedom, and national sovereignty. The Chinese people have established a new China of people's democracy. This is why the treaties and agreements concluded between the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and the People's Republic of China are of particular significance. From now on, the friendship between the Soviet Union and the Chinese people is built on an unshakable foundation as solid as a rock.

　　Any intention of aggression and plunder is incompatible with the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China. Their policy is a policy of striving for peace and the security of all countries. The Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance, the treaty signed between the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China on February 14, is filled with the desire to consolidate lasting peace by further developing friendship and cooperation between the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China in every article. The basic task of the treaty is to prevent re-aggression and disruption of peace by Japan or any other state that is directly or indirectly colluding with Japan in acts of aggression.

　　Under the new treaty, the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China guarantee to jointly achieve the conclusion of a peace treaty with Japan as soon as possible after the Second World War with the other Allied powers with each other's consent.

　　The contracting parties guarantee to participate in all international activities aimed at ensuring world peace and security in a spirit of faithful cooperation.

　　The urgency of this task hardly needs to be proved now that the Japanese reactionaries, under the protection of the American occupation authorities, are becoming increasingly arrogant and openly declaring their revanchist adventures; now that American imperialism is striving to turn Japan into its strategic bridgehead for attacking the Soviet Union and attacking people's democratic China. It is precisely for this purpose that the American ruling circles are delaying the conclusion of a peace treaty with Japan, trying every means to conclude a separate peace treaty with Japan, which would enable them to occupy Japan indefinitely and station troops in Japan for as long as possible.

　　The contracting parties undertake, in accordance with the interests of consolidating peace and universal security, to consult each other on all major international issues concerning the common interests of China and the Soviet Union.

　　The Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance stipulates that the Soviet Union and China shall, in accordance with the principles of equality, mutual benefit, mutual respect for national sovereignty and territorial integrity, and non-interference in each other's internal affairs, make every effort to develop and consolidate economic and cultural ties between the Soviet Union and China.

　　The treaty is valid for thirty years.

　　The fundamental changes that have taken place in the Far East since 1945, namely: the defeat of imperialist Japan, the overthrow of the reactionary Kuomintang government, and the founding of the People's Republic of China, with the establishment of a people's government friendly to the Soviet Union headed by Mao Zedong, have created a new situation that has made it possible to re-address the issues of the Chinese Changchun Railway, Port Arthur, and Dalian. The agreement reached on this issue stipulates that the Soviet government shall transfer to the government of the People's Republic of China, free of charge, all rights to the joint administration of the Chinese Changchun Railway and all property belonging to the railway. This transfer shall be implemented immediately after the conclusion of a peace treaty with Japan, but no later than the end of 1952.

　　The lofty principles and consistency of Soviet Stalinist foreign policy and its unparalleled greatness are brilliantly manifested in the Agreement on the Chinese Changchun Railway. The Chinese Changchun Railway Agreement demonstrates the Soviet Union's great respect for the national independence, national rights, and interests of the Chinese people. The clause in the agreement stipulating that the Soviet troops shall withdraw from the jointly used naval base of Port Arthur and transfer all equipment in the area to the government of the People's Republic of China is also filled with the spirit of profound respect for the national independence, national rights, and interests of the Chinese people. The withdrawal of Soviet troops and the transfer of equipment shall be carried out immediately after the conclusion of a peace treaty with Japan, but no later than the end of 1952. The agreement stipulates that the People's Republic of China shall compensate the Soviet Union for the expenses for the restoration and construction of the equipment since 1945.

　　The Agreement on Port Arthur indicates that once either of the contracting parties is drawn into military action as a result of aggression by Japan or any country colluding with Japan, the two countries may jointly use the Port Arthur naval base upon the proposal of the government of the People's Republic of China and with the consent of the Soviet government to facilitate the joint fight against the aggressor.

　　The issue of the Port of Dalian will be addressed after the conclusion of a peace treaty with Japan.

　　The Agreement on the Soviet Government Granting Long-Term Economic Loans to the People's Republic of China is based on the determination of the contracting parties to consolidate economic and cultural ties between the peoples of the Soviet Union and China and to strive to provide each other with full economic assistance. Every article of this agreement proves the truly fraternal friendship of the Soviet Union to the Chinese people in providing all kinds of support in restoring and developing their national economy, which has been damaged by long-term military action. The decision of the Soviet government to transfer to the government of the People's Republic of China, free of charge, the property obtained by Soviet economic organs from Japanese owners in Northeast China, and the decision of the Soviet government to transfer all real estate of the former Beijing barracks to the government of the People's Republic of China, are also filled with this chivalrous and fraternal attitude towards the Chinese people.

　　One can see at a glance that the documents signed on February 14th contain a wide range of major political and economic issues relating to the relations between the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China. The contents of the documents show with exceptional clarity that the issues handled in the Sino-Soviet negotiations were resolved in a spirit of sincere friendship and deep mutual understanding. There is no doubt that a new era in the development of Sino-Soviet relations has unfolded, and the further consolidation of friendship and cooperation between the two great peoples will become the hallmark of this new era. At the same time, the extensive and close cooperation between the peoples of the Soviet Union and China based on alliance and friendship will mean the full consolidation of the front for the struggle for peace and universal security. The Soviet people celebrate the signing of the above-mentioned treaties and agreements with deep satisfaction, considering this as new proof of strengthening the friendship between the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China. All friends of peace, democracy, and progress also welcome the consolidation of Sino-Soviet friendship with the same deep satisfaction.

　　Long live the alliance and friendship between the Soviet people and the people of the People's Republic of China!

### 苏中友谊万岁！  真理报社论

　　苏中友谊万岁！
    真理报社论
    【新华社北京十六日电】塔斯社莫斯科二月十六日电：本日真理报以《苏中友谊万岁！》为题发表社论，全文如下：
    苏联与中华人民共和国友好同盟互助条约，关于中国长春铁路、旅顺口及大连的协定以及关于苏联政府给予中华人民共和国以长期经济贷款的协定，业于二月十四日在克里姆林宫签订，并于昨日在真理报上发表。这些条约和协定使得苏中两国人民友谊的发展与巩固进入一个新的纪元，标志着国际关系发展的新阶段，对于巩固全世界和平与民主的事业是重大贡献。这些所已发表的文件，表现着在莫斯科进行的谈判的成果。苏联方面参加这次谈判的是苏联部长会议主席约瑟夫·斯大林同志和苏联外交部长安得列·维辛斯基，中国方面是中华人民共和国中央人民政府主席毛泽东和中华人民共和国政务院总理兼外交部长周恩来。由于谈判的结果和由于签订友好同盟互助条约以及关于中国长春铁路的协定，苏联及中华人民共和国外交部长曾互换照会，声明一九四五年八月十四日所缔结的苏中条约及关于中国长春铁路的协定，均失其效力，而且双方政府确认蒙古人民共和国之独立地位，已因一九四五年的公民投票及中华人民共和国业已与蒙古人民共和国建立外交关系而获得了充分保证。
    签订的文件确定了苏中两国人民的历史上的连系，并保证了苏中两国人民深厚和持久的友谊的更进一步发展，这些文件的巨大重要性是无以复加的。
    苏联的斯大林外交政策原则的伟大，在这些文件中有着生动的表现。这些文件同时亦反映了一九四五年以来远东局势所已发生的基本变化。
    苏联曾始终如一地以巨大的同情关注中国人民及其为解脱封建和帝国主义枷锁、争取民族独立的顽强斗争。早在一九二五年，斯大林同志即说过，中国革命运动的力量是不可计量的。它们现在还没有充分表现出来。在将来，它们是会表现出来的。看不见这些力量，并且不给它们以应有的估计的东方和西方的统治者们，将要为此付出他们的代价……这里，真理和正义完全是在中国革命的一方面。这就是为什么我们在现在和将来都同情中国的革命、同情中国人民自帝国主义枷锁之下争取解放、争取中国的统一为一个统一的国家的斗争。
    广大的中国人民群众一贯认为苏联是他们牢固可靠和忠诚的朋友。标志着人类世界历史根本转折的伟大十月革命也给中国的发展开了新的阶段。列宁与斯大林伟大与不朽的思想启发了中国劳动人民为摆脱殖民地与帝国主义奴役的锁链而斗争。
    中国人民看到：苏联对中国表现了那样的态度，这种态度在根本上和在原则上是与资本主义国家的态度不同的。苏维埃政府一开始便宣布废除“与日本、中国及前同盟国缔结的一切秘密协定，沙皇政府与其同盟国共同利用这些协定威胁利诱，来奴役东方而主要是中国人民……”（摘自一九一九年七月二十五日人民委员会告中国人民及中国南方北方政府书）
    中国最优秀的人民、真正的中国爱国者已明白了解：只有经由对伟大的苏维埃人民的友谊与同盟，中国人民才保证得了他们的自由与独立。孙中山一九二五年三月十一日在临终致苏联中央执行委员会的信中写道：“亲爱的同志：当此与你们诀别之际，我愿表示我热烈的希望，希望不久即将破晓，斯时，苏联以良友及盟国而欢迎强盛独立之中国！两国在争世界被压迫民族自由之大战中，携手并进以取得胜利。”
    如今，中国人民解放的日子已经来到。中国人民已达成了有历史意义的胜利，彻底击溃了腐朽的国民党政权并且摆脱了帝国主义枷锁的束缚。以中国人民的领袖毛泽东为首的光辉的中国共产党是民族解放斗争与中国人民的创造历史的胜利的鼓舞者与组织者。中国人民的决定性的胜利之成为可能，是由于伟大斯大林领导下的苏联发挥了决定性的作用而击溃了德国法西斯主义与日本帝国主义的结果。
    中国人民业已成为自己命运的主人，并在为和平、民主与社会主义而斗争的阵营中有其光荣的地位。毛泽东说：“中国和苏联的伟大人民是由深厚和持久的友谊团结起来的”。
    中国人民有史以来第一次获得了真正的独立、自由与国家主权。中国人民建立了人民民主的新中国。这就是为什么苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟与中华人民共和国之间缔结的条约和协定具有特别的意义。从今以后，苏联和中国人民的友谊是建立在不可动摇的坚如磐石的基础上了。
    任何侵略和掠夺的意图都是与苏联和中华人民共和国不相容的。它们的政策是为和平与各国安全而奋斗的政策。友好同盟互助条约，苏联与中华人民共和国于二月十四日签订的条约，其中每一条都充满着以进一步发展苏联和中华人民共和国之间的友谊和合作来巩固持久和平的愿望。条约的基本任务是制止日本或其他直接间接在侵略行为上与日本相勾结的任何国家之重新侵略与破坏和平。
    根据新的条约，苏联和中华人民共和国保证经过彼此同意与第二次世界战争时期的其他同盟国于尽可能的短期内共同取得对日和约的缔结。
    缔约国双方保证以忠诚合作的精神，参加所有以确保世界和平与安全为目的的国际活动。
    现在，日本反动派正在美国占领当局的庇护下愈益狂妄，并且公然宣布它的复仇冒险；现在，美国帝国主义正竭力把日本变成它的进攻苏联和进攻人民民主中国的战略桥头堡垒，在这个时候，这个任务的紧急性是几乎不需要证明的。正是为了这一目的，美国统治集团才延搁对日和约的签订，想尽种种手段来缔结这种单独的对日和约，因为这将使他们能够无限期占领日本，且尽可能长期在日本驻扎军队。
    缔约国双方约许根据巩固和平与普遍安全的利益，对有关中苏两国共同利益的一切重大的国际问题，均进行彼此协商。
    友好同盟互助条约规定苏中两国遵照平等、互利以及互相尊重国家主权与领土完整及不干涉对方内政的原则，全力发展和巩固苏联与中国之间的经济与文化关系。
    条约有效期限为三十年。
    自一九四五年以来在远东发生的基本变化，即：帝国主义日本的失败，反动国民党政府的被推翻和中华人民共和国的宣布成立，以毛泽东为首的与苏联友好的人民政府的成立，造成了新的形势，使得对中国长春铁路、旅顺口和大连问题的重新处理成为可能。关于这一问题所达成的协议，规定苏联政府将共同管理中国长春铁路的一切权利以及属于该铁路的全部财产无偿地移交中华人民共和国政府。此项移交，一俟对日和约缔结后立即实现，但不迟于一九五二年末。
    苏联斯大林外交政策的崇高原则和一贯性以及它无比的伟大，在关于中国长春铁路的协定上有其光辉的表现。中国长春铁路协定表明了苏联对中国人民的民族独立、民族权利和利益的伟大尊重。协定中规定：苏联军队自共同使用的旅顺口海军根据地撤退并将该地区的一切设备移交中华人民共和国政府的一项条款，也同样充满着对中国人民的民族独立、民族权利和利益的深为尊重的精神。苏联军队的撤退和设备的移交都将在对日和约缔结后立即实行，但不迟于一九五二年末。协定规定由中华人民共和国偿付苏联自一九四五年起对设备之恢复与建设的费用。
    关于旅顺口的协定指明：一旦缔约国任何一方受到日本或其他与日本相勾结的任何国家之侵略因而被卷入军事行动时，经中华人民共和国政府提议及苏联政府同意，中苏两国可共同使用旅顺口海军根据地，以利共同对侵略者作战。
    关于大连港问题，将在对日和约缔结后处理。
    苏联政府给中华人民共和国长期经济贷款的协定是以缔约国双方决心巩固苏中两国人民间的经济和文化联系、努力互相给予全力的经济援助为基础的。这个协定的每一条都证明苏联对中国人民在恢复和发展其为长期军事行动所破坏的国家经济中给以各种支援的真正兄弟般的友情。苏联政府将苏联经济机关在中国东北自日本所有者手中所获得之财产无偿地移交中华人民共和国政府的决定以及苏联政府将过去北京兵营的全部房产移交中华人民共和国政府的决定，也同样充满着这种对中国人民的侠义的兄弟般的态度。
    人们一眼就可以看出，二月十四日签订的文件包含着关系于苏联与中华人民共和国关系的广泛的重大政治与经济问题。文件的内容异常清楚地显示出：苏中谈判过程中所处理的问题是在恳切的友谊与深切的互相谅解的精神下解决的。毫无疑问地可以说，苏中关系发展的新纪元业已展开，而两国伟大人民间的友谊与合作更进一步的巩固将成为这个新纪元的标志。同时，苏中两国人民之间基于同盟与友好的规模广泛而亲密的合作将意味着全力巩固为和平与普遍安全而斗争的阵线。苏联人民以深深满意的心情庆贺上述条约和协定的签订，认为这是加强苏联与中华人民共和国的友谊的新的证明。所有和平、民主及进步的友人也都以同样深为满意的心情欢迎苏中友谊的巩固。
    苏联人民与中华人民共和国人民之间的同盟与友谊万岁！
