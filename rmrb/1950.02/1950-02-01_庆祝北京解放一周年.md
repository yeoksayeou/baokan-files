　　Celebrating the First Anniversary of the Liberation of Beijing
    Peng Zhen
    Today is the first anniversary of the liberation of Beijing.

    In this past year, under the direct leadership of Chairman Mao, the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, and the Central People's Government, we, the people of Beijing, relied on the great People's Liberation Army, the people's own awareness and unity, and the organizational strength of workers, peasants, youth, and women. We eliminated armed counter-revolutionaries, smashed reactionary political institutions, destroyed the Kuomintang, the Three Youth League, and other hidden organizations of spies, established a people's democratic dictatorship, restored and developed production and the people's cultural and educational undertakings, carried out various municipal construction and reforms, began to change the social atmosphere, and conducted land reform in the suburbs. Although there will be many difficulties in the future development, as in the past, we have laid a good foundation for further developing various constructions in the capital.

    Now, based on the experience of the past year, I would like to offer some opinions on several issues.

    (1) In terms of political power construction

    First, all the people of our city must further unite and give fuller play to the role of the People's Representative Conference.

    Last year, we convened two sessions of the People's Representative Conference. Its experience proves that the People's Representative Conference (or People's Congress) is the best organizational form for the people to directly manage municipal affairs. It can quickly gather the opinions of people from all walks of life and turn them into their own resolutions, or reflect them to the Central People's Government. It can also quickly transform the instructions of the Central People's Government and its own resolutions into the opinions and actions of the masses of people from all strata. It is the weapon for the People's Government to use criticism and self-criticism to prevent and overcome bureaucracy, constantly improve its work, and closely connect with the masses.

    Looking back, Beijing should have convened the People's Representative Conference in the early days of liberation to cooperate with the Military Control Commission. Our People's Representative Conference in Beijing was convened a bit late.

    This year, all sectors of the people in Beijing should make fuller use of this organizational form to pool their wisdom and efforts to manage the affairs of our capital, and to manage and improve our municipality.

    Secondly, we should also establish district-level People's Representative Conferences.

    At the beginning of entering the city, we dispatched a large number of work groups to work in various streets and alleys. Relying on them, we quickly accommodated scattered officers and soldiers, hunted down counter-revolutionaries, destroyed the reactionary Baojia system, established revolutionary order, and solved some livelihood problems for the citizens. In a very short period, we established extensive contact with the residents. Now that these temporary work groups have been withdrawn, in order to discuss and carry out some common work for residents in each district at the district level, to strengthen the connection between the district government and the people in its district, to improve the efficiency of political power, and to prevent and overcome the phenomenon of all party, government, and people's personnel being divorced from the masses and the bureaucratic style, we believe that it is necessary to convene the People's Representative Conference at the district level in a big city like Beijing.

    In addition, the police stations of the Public Security Bureau should become organs that closely connect with the masses. The police station is an organ that directly serves the citizens and has the most frequent contact with the masses. Every staff member must have the loyalty to serve the people wholeheartedly and should become a good servant and guard of the people. Now, the vast majority of the staff of the police stations are good, but there are indeed a small number of old police officers who have not gotten rid of the bad habits of reactionary rulers who act as overlords, resulting in a serious phenomenon of being divorced from the masses. We should quickly overcome this phenomenon.

    (2) Continue to restore and develop production

    The ultimate goal of the revolution is to liberate the productive forces and develop production. Restoring, reorganizing, and developing Beijing's production was our central task in the past year, and it remains our overriding central task in the future.

    In the past year, Beijing's production has made great achievements.

    Productivity has increased rapidly, which is most evident in the state-owned production sector. The highest iron production record of the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant has exceeded the highest output during the Kuomintang's rule by 73%; the operating rate of the Beijing Machine General Factory has tripled compared to before liberation. Many other state-owned factories have also created new production records. In the private sector, if we compare the average number of last year with the average number of the Kuomintang period in 1948, the annual output per capita of the mechanized flour industry increased by 67%. The metal smelting and casting industry increased by 95%. The weaving and dyeing industry increased by 55%. Let the reactionaries say we can't manage the city! The ironclad facts prove that productivity is increasing rapidly in our hands.

    The scale of production has also expanded. In terms of industrial electricity consumption, it increased by 12.8% in the past year compared to 1948. The number of municipal enterprise workers has increased from 8,845 before liberation to 12,351, an increase of 39.6%. The number of private industrial households has increased by 51% compared to February of last year, and the total number of employees has increased by 47%.

    From the trend of production development, all industries necessary for production development and people's lives have rapidly recovered or developed. On the contrary, they quickly declined or collapsed. For example, the number of foreign liquor and soda factories has decreased by 36% and 26%, and the output has decreased by 85% and 73%.

    The same trend is also reflected in the commercial sector. The number of industries engaged in the trade of production tools and daily necessities has increased to varying degrees. Compared with the Kuomintang rule period, the smallest increased by 7%, and the largest increased by 187%. The number of commercial households such as Western clothing, Western food, hotels, antiques, jade articles, incense candles and firecrackers, and gold and silver jewelry has decreased. The proportion of reduction is the smallest by 3%, and the largest by 65%. This change is completely in line with our policies and the interests of the people.

    In 1950, we must concentrate greater efforts to continue to restore and develop production, and overcome the weaknesses and difficulties in production.

    First, we should develop state-owned production, improve its planning, strictly implement cost accounting, and launch production competitions and new record movements. All state-owned enterprises should also sign collective contracts with workers represented by trade unions, further complete the democratic reform of the factory management system, earnestly improve factory management, and pay attention to the welfare of workers. We should change the egalitarianism and other unreasonable phenomena in wages left over from the Kuomintang, and adjust wages according to the principle of distribution according to work and bonus for exceeding quotas. The Communist Party and New Democratic Youth League branches and trade union organizations in all state-owned enterprises must regard leading employees to actively produce, improve production technology and labor organization as their primary tasks.

    We should strengthen the leadership of the government and state-owned enterprises over private enterprises, reduce their production blindness, and enable them to continue to restore, reorganize, and develop their production in accordance with the principles of the New Democratic economy and the needs of urban and rural people. In the past year, we have given private industry great help and convenience in adjusting labor-capital relations, signing labor-capital collective contracts, supplying raw materials, opening up sales channels, implementing low-interest loans, and reducing industrial taxes. Without these conditions, private industry would not have been able to achieve such rapid recovery and development. We should continue to give them the support and assistance they deserve.

    Whether in state-owned or private industry, the biggest shortcomings now are high costs and low quality. We must quickly launch a campaign to improve quality and reduce costs.

    In agricultural production, we must closely integrate the land reform currently underway with production work, develop farmers' production mutual aid organizations, promote intensive cultivation, develop water conservancy, and make full use of urban manure, garbage, and sewage to fertilize the fields.

    In order to improve the lives of organs, cadres, and school personnel, we should vigorously develop agricultural and industrial production in organs and schools this year. The first is to grow a lot of vegetables. If we can rely on organ production to supply each person with hundreds of catties of vegetables a year, we can greatly improve our nutrition.

    (3) Regarding education and other municipal construction undertakings

    There are two fundamentally opposite policies in education and other municipal construction work:

    One is the reactionary policy inherited from the Kuomintang reactionary rulers and the Manchurian warlords of the Northern Warlord era. Their education and their municipal construction served the reactionary exploiters and rulers. The schools they established, the roads, sewers, and tap water they built, and their medical and health facilities were all built in so-called "rich areas". In densely populated working people's residential areas, not only were there a lack of tap water and sewers, but also the roads were extremely bad, and there were few schools and hospitals.

    The other is our policy. It is completely opposite to the Kuomintang. Our education and our municipal construction serve the masses of the people and serve the recovery and development of production. Beijing is the glorious capital of the people. Therefore, our municipal construction also serves the organs of the Central People's Government that represent and lead the people of the whole country. Serving the masses of the people, serving production, and serving the Central People's Government, these three tasks are unified and inseparable.

    According to this policy, this year, we should not only continue to improve the existing secondary and primary school education, but also increase the number of secondary and primary schools in densely populated working-class areas. We should develop various technical education and normal education. We should develop supplementary education for the working people, reorganize and develop evening schools, and launch a popular literary and artistic movement among the masses of the working people.

    In terms of health facilities, we do not yet have the strength to add a large number of hospitals. Therefore, in addition to effectively reorganizing the existing public hospitals, we should establish clinics in densely populated working-class areas and increase mobile medical teams in the suburbs. Entrust all public and private hospitals to provide free or reduced-price medical treatment for poor people with government subsidies.

    We should not only reorganize a part of the original sewers, but also build new sewers in working people's residential areas where there are no sewers or the sewers are clogged and the environmental sanitation is the worst, fill in stinky puddles, and dredge and reorganize stinky ditches such as Longxugou and Dashiqiao to improve the environmental sanitation in these areas.

    We should also adopt the same policy in road construction and tap water facilities.

    In the treatment of urban garbage, manure, and sewage, we should formulate new treatment plans and methods based on the policy of serving production. Garbage should be classified and transported, and those that can fertilize the fields should be used to fertilize the fields. Urban sewage should be used as much as possible to irrigate the farmland in the suburbs.

    Our government is the people's government. In the expenditure of municipal construction, we cannot waste and squander the people's blood and sweat like the reactionary rulers. We must be "diligent and thrifty" and strive to make greater achievements with less spending. We should use precise calculations, pool our wisdom and efforts, and work together to achieve this goal.

    Our cause is great, and our tasks are arduous. There are still many difficulties in the future. The key to overcoming difficulties and completing tasks is to strengthen the organizational strength of workers, peasants, youth, women, and other people, and to closely unite the people from all walks of life. Communists and non-party friends must unite, old cadres and new cadres must unite, workers and other working people themselves must unite, and the four friends of the new democratic revolution must unite. The political basis of our unity is the Common Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference. The purpose of our unity is to implement the people's democratic dictatorship in accordance with this program, restore and develop production and cultural construction, support the front line, and build the people's capital. In all the above work, the Communist Party members should follow Chairman Mao's instructions, serve the people wholeheartedly, learn from the masses well, and strive to become models of production, models of work, models of learning, and models of abiding by government laws and obeying discipline.

　　庆祝北京解放一周年
      彭真
    今天是北京解放的一周年。
    在这一年中，我们北京人民在毛主席、中共中央和中央人民政府的直接领导下，依靠伟大的人民解放军，依靠人民自己的觉悟和团结，依靠工人、农民、青年、妇女的组织力量，消灭了反革命的武装，粉碎了反动的政权机构，摧毁了国民党、三青团和特务等潜伏的组织，建设了人民民主专政的政权，恢复与发展了生产及人民的文化教育事业，进行了各项市政建设与改革，开始改变了社会的风气并在郊区进行着土地改革。虽然，在今后的发展中，也和过去一样还有许多困难，但我们已经为进一步发展首都的各项建设，奠定了良好的基础。
    现在我想根据过去一年的经验，就几个问题提出一些意见。
    （一）在政权建设方面
    首先，我们全市人民要进一步团结起来，更加充分地发挥各界人民代表会议的作用。
    去年我们召开过两届各界人民代表会议。它的经验证明，各界人民代表会议（或人民代表大会），是人民直接管理市政的最好的组织形式，它可以把各界人民的意见迅速集中起来作成自己的决议，或反映到中央人民政府；它又可以把中央人民政府的指示和自己的决议，迅速变为各阶层人民大众的意见和行动。它是人民政府运用批评与自我批评的方式，防止与克服官僚主义，不断改进自己的工作，和密切联系群众的武器。
    回想起来，北京市在解放初期，就应该召开各界人民代表会议，来和军事管制委员会相配合。我们北京市的各界人民代表会议是召集得稍为晚了些。
    今年我们北京市各界人民应该更充分地运用这种组织形式，来群策群力地管理我们首都人民自己的事情，管理与改进我们的市政。
    其次，我们还应该建立区的人民代表会议。
    在进城之初，我们曾经分派了大批的工作组，深入到各街巷去工作。依靠他们，我们曾迅速地收容了流散官兵，搜捕了反革命分子，摧毁了反动的保甲制度，建立起革命秩序，并解决了市民若干生活上的问题，在极短的期间和居民建立了广泛的联系。现在这种临时性的工作组已经撤消了，为了在区一级商讨并进行一些各区居民共同性质的工作，为了密切区政府与本区人民的联系，提高政权的工作效能，为了防止和克服党、政、民一切工作人员，脱离群众的现象和官僚主义的作风，区的各界人民代表会议，在北京这样的大城市，我们认为是有召开的必要的。
    此外，公安局派出所应该成为密切联系群众的机关。派出所是直接为市民服务，和群众接触最频繁的机关，它的每个工作人员必须具有全心全意为人民服务的忠心，应该成为人民良好的勤务员和警卫员。现在派出所的工作人员绝大部分是好的，但是确实还有一小部分旧的警务人员，没有去掉反动统治者作威作福的恶习，以致造成了严重脱离群众的现象。我们应该迅速克服这种现象。
    （二）继续恢复与发展生产
    革命的终极目的，是为了解放生产力，发展生产。恢复、改组与发展北京的生产，这是我们过去一年的中心任务，今后仍然是我们压倒一切的中心任务。
    过去一年内，北京的生产事业是有很大成绩的。
    生产力是迅速提高了，这在公营生产方面，表现得最为明显。石景山钢铁厂的最高产铁纪录已经比国民党统治时期的最高产量，超过了百分之七十三；北京机器总厂机器开动率已达解放前的三倍。其他很多公营工厂也都创造了生产的新纪录。在私营企业方面，如果把去年的平均数与一九四八年国民党时期的平均数相比较，机制面粉业每人年产量提高了百分之六十七。金属冶铸业，提高了百分之九十五。织染业提高了百分之五十五。让反动派说我们不会管理城市吧！铁一般的事实证明，生产力在我们手里，是飞速地提高了。
    生产的规模也扩大了。以工业用电量来讲，过去一年较一九四八年增加了百分之一二·八，市营企业工人已由解放前的八八四五人增加为一二三五一人，即增加了百分之三九·六。私营工业的户数已较去年二月增加了百分之五十一，职工总数增加了百分之四十七。
    从生产发展的动向来讲，凡为生产发展和人民生活所必需的工业，都迅速地恢复或发展了。反之，就迅速地下降或崩溃了，例如洋酒业和汽水业，厂数已减少了百分之三十六和百分之二十六，产量已减少了百分之八十五和百分之七十三。
    在商业方面，也表现了同样的趋势。有三十种经营生产工具和日用必需品贸易的行业，都或多或少的增加了户数。与国民党统治时期比较最少的增加了百分之七，最多的增加了百分之一百八十七。西服、西餐、酒店、古玩、玉器、香烛鞭炮、金银首饰等商业户数都减少了，减少的比例最少者为百分之三，最多者为百分之六十五。这种变化是完全合乎我们的方针和人民利益的。
    一九五○年，我们必须集中更大的力量来继续恢复和发展生产，并且克服生产方面的弱点和困难。
    首先，应该发展公营生产，提高它的计划性，严格实行成本计算，开展生产竞赛和新纪录运动。一切公营企业也应该以工会为代表和工人订立集体合同，应该进一步完成工厂管理制度上的民主改革，切实改善工厂的管理，并注意工人的福利事业。应该改变国民党遗留下来的工资上的平均主义及其他不合理现象，根据按劳取酬和超额奖励的原则，调整工资。一切公营企业中的共产党和新民主主义青年团的支部及工会组织，必须把领导职工积极生产、改进生产技术和劳动组织，当做自己的首要任务。
    应该加强政府和公营企业对私营企业的领导，减少他们的生产盲目性，使他们按照新民主主义经济原则和城乡人民的需要，来继续恢复、改组与发展他们的生产。过去一年，我们在调整劳资关系、订立劳资集体合同、供给原料、打开销路、实行低利贷款和减轻工业税等方面，曾给了私营工业以很大的帮助和便利。没有这些条件，私营工业是不可能获得这样迅速的恢复和发展的。我们应该继续给他们以应有的扶持和帮助。
    无论在公营和私营工业中，现在最大的缺点，都是成本高而质量低。我们必须迅速开展提高质量减低成本的运动。
    在农业生产方面，我们必须把目前正在进行中的土地改革与生产工作密切结合起来，发展农民的生产互助组织，提倡深耕细作，发展水利事业，并充分利用城市的粪便、垃圾和下水道的秽水来肥田。
    为了改善机关、干部、学校人员的生活，我们今年应该大力发展机关学校的农业和工业生产。首先是大量种菜，如果我们能够依靠机关生产，一年供应每个人上百斤或几百斤的菜蔬，就可以大大改善我们的营养。
    （三）关于教育和其他市政建设事业
    在教育和其他市政建设工作中，有两条根本相反的方针：
    一条是国民党反动统治者和满清北洋军阀一脉相承的反动方针。他们的教育，他们的市政建设，是为反动的剥削者、统治者服务的。他们所设的学校，他们所修的道路、下水道和自来水，他们的医疗卫生设备，都是建设在所谓“富贵地区”的。在人口密度很高的劳动人民居住区域，不仅缺少自来水、下水道等设备，而且道路极坏，学校、医院很少。
    另一条是我们的方针。它是和国民党完全相反的。我们的教育事业，我们的市政建设，是为人民大众服务的，为恢复发展生产服务的。北京是光荣的人民首都，因此我们的市政建设，同时又是为代表与领导全国人民的中央人民政府各机关服务的。服务于人民大众、服务于生产、服务于中央人民政府，这三个任务是统一而不可分的。
    根据这样的方针，今年，我们不仅应该继续改进已有的中学小学教育，而且应该在劳动人民密集的地区增设中学和小学。应该发展各种技术教育和师范教育。应该发展劳动人民的补习教育，整理与发展业余学校，并且向劳动人民大众展开普及文艺的运动。
    在卫生设备方面，目前我们还没有力量增设大量的医院。因此，我们除对已有的公立医院，加以切实整理外，应该在劳动人民密集的地区，普遍设立诊疗所，在郊区，增设巡回医疗队。委托所有公私医院，在政府津贴的条件下，为贫苦人民免费或减费施诊。
    我们不仅应该整理一部分原有的下水道，而且要在没有下水道或下水道淤塞、环境卫生最坏的劳动人民居住地区，修建新的下水道，填平臭水坑，疏浚、整理龙须沟和大石桥等处的臭水沟，以改善这些地区的环境卫生。
    在道路修建和自来水设备方面，我们也应该采取同样的方针。
    在城市垃圾、粪便和下水道秽水的处理方面，应该根据为生产服务的方针，制订新的处理计划和办法。垃圾应该分类积运，凡能够肥田者，应该用来肥田。城市下水道的秽水，应该尽量设法用来灌溉郊区的农田。
    我们的政府是人民的政府。在市政建设的开支方面，我们不能像反动统治者那样浪费，挥霍人民的血汗。我们必须“克勤克俭”，争取以较少的花费作出较大的事业。我们应该用精密计算，群策群力，大家动手，来达到这样的目的。
    我们的事业是伟大的，我们的任务是繁重的。我们今后的困难，还是很多的。克服困难完成任务的关键，是工人、农民、青年、妇女和其他人民的组织力量的加强，是各界人民的亲密团结。共产党员与党外朋友要团结，老干部与新干部要团结，工人和其他劳动人民自身要团结，新民主主义革命的四个朋友要团结。我们团结的政治基础是人民政治协商会议的共同纲领，我们团结的目的，是为了按照这个纲领来实行人民民主专政，恢复并发展生产和文化建设事业，支援前线，建设人民的首都。在所有上述工作中，共产党员应该按照毛主席的指示，全心全意为人民服务，好好向群众学习，努力使自己成为生产的模范，工作的模范，学习的模范，遵守政府法令和服从纪律的模范。（附图片）
