Important Conditions for Educating Cadres

The Soviet people's selfless patriotic labor has brought about new and ever newer achievements. In the three years and ten months of the post-war Five-Year Plan, the pre-war level of the national economy was not only reached but also surpassed. In the nationwide competition to complete the Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule, the Soviet people's creative initiatives are bursting forth endlessly, prompting further and more powerful improvements in the economy and culture of our great socialist motherland.

The achievements of the national economy are great, but we cannot rest on these achievements, as this would lead to stagnation and adherence to convention. The Party has always insisted on criticism and self-criticism, and uses this to educate cadres.

But no matter how great the achievements, they have no right to rest on them. Comrade Stalin taught us: do not be complacent and be misled by temporary victories. Complacency, arrogance, and self-esteem will lead to stagnation and adherence to old ways. The Communist Party fully supports new, advanced, and progressive things, and this has achieved success in all sectors of economic and cultural construction. In all its work, our Party has consistently and tirelessly implemented the method of criticism and self-criticism, correcting errors and shortcomings, and on this basis educating Party and Soviet cadres.

The Party teaches all our workers not to fall into exaggeration, to correctly evaluate achievements, and at the same time pay attention to shortcomings. We must approach these shortcomings with a true Bolshevik intolerance, honestly admit mistakes, quickly correct them, and not repeat them in the future. Comrade Stalin instructed: "... the duty of the Bolsheviks is not to conceal their mistakes, to evade their mistakes, as we often do; but to honestly and openly admit their mistakes, to honestly and openly determine the methods of correcting these mistakes, to honestly and openly correct their mistakes."

Our further success, the acceleration of our progress, mainly depends on the degree of our determination to fight against shortcomings in our work. At the same time, the strength of our cadres, educated by the Party of Lenin and Stalin in the spirit of Bolshevik criticism and self-criticism, lies in their ability to objectively evaluate what is right and wrong in their work, in their uncompromising attitude towards shortcomings, and in overcoming all difficulties on the road to achieving their goals.

Our national economy is confidently moving forward, in a new and powerful upsurge. However, we still have backward enterprises, collective farms, machine tractor stations, and state farms that have not completed their plans and have not made good use of their internal potential and reserves. We sternly demand that the leaders of backward areas overcome backwardness, eliminate shortcomings in their work, and correct errors.

Correctly educating cadres means teaching workers through their own mistakes and shortcomings. It requires Party and economic departments to act in accordance with the interests of the Party and the interests of the Soviet state in all their actions. Every worker's actions should be evaluated from this perspective. Soviet workers should be strict with themselves: they must have the courage to critically evaluate their actions and persistently and thoroughly eliminate shortcomings and correct errors. Some workers are afraid to honestly admit their mistakes, thinking that they will lose their prestige. The incorrectness of this view is self-evident. Openly admitting mistakes and honestly correcting them will not diminish a worker's prestige, and it is a necessary condition for correctly educating cadres.

Cadres must be educated to openly admit mistakes and honestly correct them.

But admitting mistakes is only part of the matter. The Party requires the admission of mistakes not for the sake of admission, but in order to expose them in a timely manner, analyze the causes of the mistakes, and not repeat them.

We have workers who always condone mistakes in their work, and after admitting them, they calmly make them again. For example, Comrade Baranov, the manager of the "Kuibyshev Coal Industry" Trust, is such a person. The labor productivity in the mines of the "Kuibyshev Coal Industry" Trust is the lowest in Kuzbass, and the mechanical equipment is not well utilized. Comrade Baranov does not adopt any other working methods except for commanding, ordering, and occasionally scolding. He does not pay attention to the opinions of the Party and trade union organizations, does not rely on activists, and does not consult with workers. Whenever Baranov's mistakes are pointed out, he makes a speech of repentance, promising that the activities of the trust will be improved. But time passes, and everything remains the same.

We must oppose such an attitude: as soon as his mistakes are criticized, he hastily accepts them, but the matter ends there, without seriously correcting them.

Comrade Svirid, the secretary of the Krasninsky District Committee of the Smolensk Party, is a vulgar "promiser" whose words do not match his deeds. The Krasninsky District is one of the most backward districts in the state. This situation primarily reflects the incorrect leadership methods of the Party's District Committee. The Smolensky State Committee of the Party is well aware of the shortcomings in the work of the Krasninsky District Committee. But the Krasninsky District Committee has been sharply criticized more than once at the meetings of the State Committee Bureau and at plenary sessions. Comrade Svirid, the secretary of the District Committee, is willing to accept criticism, hastily guaranteeing that "the District Committee will take the necessary measures, and the situation will be corrected in the shortest possible time." However, the matter ends there. He has not drawn any important conclusions from the criticism, and he continues to do things as before. The State Committee is also satisfied with this promise, and considers it unnecessary to check its implementation.

These unfortunate, frequently erring leaders and talkers, who only make promises in all aspects and do not want to engage in a determined struggle against shortcomings, are incapable of correcting existing errors and are incapable of launching Bolshevik criticism and self-criticism. Party organizations cannot ignore even the smallest incidents that disrupt Party and state discipline, and cannot ignore shortcomings in work and the unwillingness of individual workers to honestly and thoroughly correct these shortcomings.

Bolshevik criticism and self-criticism are the driving force of our progress. It can analyze errors and shortcomings in a timely manner. The Party uses criticism and self-criticism to educate cadres, making them principled, honest, and fair in front of the Party and the state. Comrade Stalin instructed: "If we do not point out all the shortcomings and errors in our work honestly and openly, in the spirit of Bolsheviks, it is tantamount to cutting off the road to progress. But we want to move forward. Precisely because we want to move forward, we should regard honest revolutionary self-criticism as one of our most important tasks. Without this self-criticism, we cannot move forward, without this self-criticism, we cannot develop."

Checking the implementation of tasks will greatly educate cadres, enabling them to treat shortcomings with a high degree of exactingness and intolerance.

Checking implementation is of great significance for educating cadres in a spirit of high exactingness and intolerance towards shortcomings. A skillfully organized check on implementation will enhance the sense of responsibility of each worker for the tasks entrusted to him, and will consolidate Party and state discipline in all links of all Party, Soviet, and economic organs. An accurately formulated check on implementation can expose and eliminate shortcomings in a timely manner, and can timely propose the replacement of poor and weak workers who are unable to organize a lively enterprise with good and enthusiastic leaders.

As everyone knows, success is never produced naturally. It is achieved through solid and persistent work, through constant reliance on the masses, and through the struggle against difficulties by engaging in their creative initiatives. The art of leadership lies primarily in foreseeing difficulties and obstacles, mobilizing the masses, and relying on the strength of the masses to overcome these difficulties and obstacles. Party organizations should constantly educate our cadres in the spirit of Bolshevik criticism and self-criticism, and in the spirit of high exactingness and intolerance towards shortcomings in their work.

### 教育干部的重要条件

　　教育干部的重要条件
    苏维埃人民的忘我的爱国劳动，带来了一切新而又新的成就。在战后五年计划的三年零十个月中，不仅达到而且超过了国民经济的战前水平。在争取提前完成五年计划的全人民竞赛中，苏维埃人民创造性的倡导无穷尽地迸涌着，它促使进一步，而且更有力地提高我们伟大社会主义祖国的经济与文化。
    国民经济的成就是伟大的，但不能安于这些成就。因为这会引向停滞和墨守成规。党始终坚持进行批评与自我批评，并以此教育干部。
    但是，无论成就是多么的伟大，他们没有权利安于这些成就的。斯大林同志教导说：不要自高自大和为一时胜利所惑。从容，自高自大，自尊会引向停滞和墨守旧规。共产党完全支持新的、先进的、进步的事物，这在经济与文化建设的所有部门中，都获得了成功。在自己全部工作中，我党始终不懈地实行着批评与自我批评的方法，矫正错误和缺点，同时在这个基础上教育党和苏维埃干部。
    党教导我们所有的工作者，不要陷入夸大，要正确地评价成就，同时注意缺点，对于这些缺点要抱着真正的布尔塞维克的不妥协性，诚实地承认错误，很快地矫正它们和将来不要重复它们。斯大林同志指示说：“……布尔塞维克的责任不是像我们时常那样掩饰错误，逃避错误；而是诚恳地和公开地承认自己的错误，诚恳地和公开地确定矫正这些错误的方法，诚恳地和公开地矫正自己的错误。”
    我们的进一步成功，我们前进速度的加快，主要是依靠于我们对工作中的缺点所进行斗争的坚决程度。同时，被列宁——斯大林的党以布尔塞维克批评与自我批评精神所教育的我们干部的力量，在于他们能够客观地评价工作中的对与不对，在于他们对缺点抱着不妥协性的态度和克服达到目的的路上的一切困难。
    我们的国民经济满怀信心地向前迈进，处于新而有力的高涨中。但是，我们还有落后的企业，集体农场，机器拖拉机站和国营农场，它们没有完成计划，没有好好地利用着自己内部的潜力和准备金。我们对于落后区域的领导者严正地提出克服落后、铲除工作中的缺点和纠正错误的要求。
    正确地教育干部—即是在他们本身的错误和缺点上教导工作者。要求党和经济部门的工作者，在全部自己的行动中，要根据党的利益，根据苏维埃国家的利益。正是应该用这个观点来评价每个工作者的行动。苏维埃工作者应当对自己严格：要有勇气批评地评价自己的行动，顽强地和彻底地铲除缺点和改正错误。有些工作者害怕诚实地承认自己的错误，他们想这会失掉他们的威望。这种观点的不正确性是无需证明的。公开地承认错误，诚实地改正它们是不会减少工作者的威望，而且是正确的教育干部的必要条件。
    必须教育干部公开地承认错误，诚实的改正错误。
    可是承认错误只是事情的一部分。党要求承认错误不是为了承认，而是为了适时地暴露它们，分析错误的原因和不要再重复它们。
    我们有这样的工作者，他们在工作中总是纵容错误，承认错误后又泰然地作出它们来。比如“库依贝什夫煤业”托辣斯管理者巴拉诺夫同志，就是这样的人。“库依贝什夫煤业”托辣斯矿中的劳动生产率是库兹巴斯最低的，机械装置利用得不好。巴拉诺夫同志除去支配、命令，时而叱责外，不采用任何别的工作方法。他不注意党和工会组织的意见，不依靠积极分子，不与工人商量。每逢当指出巴拉诺夫的错误时，他就作个悔悟的演说，保证托辣斯的活动将要改善。但是时间过去了，所有一切依然如故。
    反对这样的态度：一批评到他的错误，他就匆忙接受，但是事情仅止于此，而不认真地改正。
    斯摩林州党的克拉斯宁区委会书记斯维里德同志，就是言行不一致的庸俗角色的“允诺者”。克拉斯宁区是州内最落后区之一。这件事情首先说明了党的区委会的不正确的领导方法。党的斯摩林斯基州委会十分详尽地知道克拉斯宁区委会工作中的缺点。但克拉斯宁区委会在州委会局会议上和全体大会上不止一次受到尖锐的批评。区委会书记斯维里德同志情愿接受批评，忽忙地保证说：“区委会采取必要的方法，同时在最短期间内情况将会改正”。但是，事情即止于此。他并没有由于批评而做出任何重要的结论，他仍是按着老样子继续做下去。在州委会方面也满足于这种允诺，同时认为不必要去检查他们的执行。
    仅提出各方面的任何允诺而不想与缺点进行坚决斗争的这些不幸的时常犯错误的领导者、饶舌家，是没有能力改正已有的错误，没有能力展开布尔塞维克批评与自我批评的。党的组织不能够忽略即使是最小的破坏党的和国家纪律的事件，不能忽略工作中的缺点和个别工作者不愿意诚实地而彻底地改正这些缺点的情况。
    布尔塞维克的批评与自我批评是我们进步的动力。它可以适时地剖析错误和缺点。党借助于批评与自我批评教育干部，使他们在党和国家的前面具有原则性的、诚实的和公正的精神。斯大林同志指示说：“我们如果不以布尔什维克应有的精神，去诚恳地公开地指出我们工作中的一切缺点和错误，那就等于自断前进的道路。但我们是想前进的。正因为我们是想前进，我们就应当把诚恳的革命的自我批评作为我们极重要的任务之一。没有这种自我批评，我们就不能前进，没有这种自我批评，我们就不能发展。”
    检查任务的执行情况，会给干部以很大教育，使他们能够以高度的苛求和不妥协精神对待缺点。
    检查执行，对于教育干部以对缺点高度的苛求和不妥协性的精神具有重大的意义。熟练地组织起来的检查执行，会提高每个工作者对委托给他的事情的责任心，会巩固所有的党的、苏维埃的和经济机关各个环节内党的和国家的纪律。确切制定的检查执行，能够适时地揭发和铲除缺点，能适时地提出以好的热心的领导者来更换没有能力组织起生动事业的不好的软弱的工作者的问题。
    众所周知，事情的成功，无论什么时候决不是自然产生的，它是以巩固的和坚持的工作，以经常地依靠群众，依靠他们的创造性倡导而从事的与困难斗争才获得的。领导的艺术，首先在于预见困难和障碍，动员群众，依靠群众的力量，来克服这些困难和障碍。党组织应当经常地教育我们干部具有布尔塞维克的批评与自我批评的精神，具有在工作中对缺点高度苛求和不妥协的精神。
