　　Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, 8th: Tianjin's industrial production in January has made a good start toward fulfilling the 1950 production plan. State-owned factories in Tianjin universally launched a production and economy drive in January. The heavy industry sector also conducted a major production inspection, strengthened the protection of machinery and materials, and reduced waste in the production process, which added favorable conditions for various factories to complete their January production plans. The state-owned Tianjin Steel Plant, Central Electrical Equipment Factory, Weixin Chemical Plant, Tianjin Machine Factory under the North China Machine Company, Tianjin Bicycle Factory, and China Vegetable Oil Plant and China Match Factory under the Tianjin Industrial Bureau have all completed and exceeded their January production plans. The output of steel ingots at the Tianjin Steel Plant exceeded the original plan by 55 percent, and the output of wire rod exceeded by 44 percent. The seven factories under the state-owned Tianjin China Textile Company produced a total of 3.9 percent more yarn than the planned output, and 2.9 percent more cloth. Except for the Fourth Factory, whose new looms failed to reach the predetermined number, and the Third Factory, whose cloth output was slightly lower than the original plan due to power outages, all other factories exceeded the original plan for yarn and cloth output. The quality of the cloth has also improved significantly, with the regular cloth rate of each factory reaching or exceeding the standard of 96 percent stipulated in the plan. The regular cloth rate of the First Factory has reached 98.61 percent, exceeding the standard of 97 percent planned for the second half of this year. The reason why Tianjin China Textile factories were able to achieve the above results is mainly because, after the plan was formulated, it was generally communicated and discussed in a relatively detailed manner, so that the workers of each factory understood that the spirit of this year's production plan was to improve quality, as well as the specific requirements of the production plan for each workshop and each worker, thus mobilizing the workers of each factory. Secondly, most factories have established and improved the production inspection system, which has effectively cooperated with the promotion of production competitions and standard work methods.

　　Many private factories in Tianjin have also seen their production develop due to the signing of labor-management collective contracts and the gradual normalization of labor-management relations. The Yongli Chemical Company produced 4,800 tons of alkali in January, exceeding the highest record of last year by 8 percent. The output of cloth at the Hengyuan Yarn Factory increased by 6.9 percent compared with December last year, and the output of yarn increased by 3 percent. Forty-eight new looms were added to expand production capacity. Other factories, such as Lizhong Salt Factory, Zhongtian Power Plant, and Renli Wool Weaving Company, have also completed or exceeded their January production plans. The output of the Dongya Enterprise Company in December last year decreased by 13 percent compared with the output in April. The main reason was that the capitalists did not reasonably improve factory management, so the workers' production enthusiasm was not high. In January of this year, labor and management held a consultation meeting and resolved more than 60 accumulated problems between labor and management, and the factory's output increased rapidly. The weaving department of the factory increased the average daily output of each loom from 120 yards to 160 yards, with the highest reaching 220 yards. The output of麻袋(Ma dai - gunny sack) increased from more than 3,000 pieces per day to more than 7,000 pieces due to the addition of night shifts. In addition, the output of the Xingxing Paper Mill, which resolved labor disputes, also increased by 20 percent, and the cost was reduced by 25 percent.

　　天津各公营工厂一月份生产超过计划
    私营工厂订立劳资合同产量大增
    【新华社天津八日电】一月份的天津工业生产在实现一九五○年的生产计划上已成为一个良好的开端。各公营工厂在一月份内曾普遍开展了生产节约运动；重工业部门并举行了一次生产大检查，加强了机器资材的保护工作，减少了生产过程中的浪费现象，给各厂完成一月份生产计划增加了顺利条件。现国营天津制钢厂、中央电工器材厂、维新化学厂、华北机器公司所属天津机器厂、天津自行车厂和天津工业局所属的中国植物油料厂、中华火柴厂等单位均已完成并超过了一月份的生产计划。天津制钢厂钢锭的产量超过原计划百分之五十五，盘条的产量超过百分之四十四。国营天津中国纺织公司所属七个厂合计纱的产量超过了计划产量的百分之三点九，布的产量超过百分之二点九。该厂除第四厂因新开布机未能达到预定台数及第三厂受停电影响致布的产量较原订计划略低外，其他各厂纱、布产量均超过原计划。布的质量也有显著提高，各厂正布率均达到或超过计划所规定的百分之九十六的标准，其中第一厂正布率已达到百分之九十八点六一，超过了计划在今年下半年达到的百分之九十七的标准。天津中纺各厂所以能够获得上述成绩，主要是由于在计划制订后，一般地作了比较细致的传达讨论，使各厂职工明白了今年生产计划的精神在提高质量，以及生产计划对每个车间每个工人的具体要求，因而使各厂职工动员起来。其次，大部分工厂都建立和健全了生产检查制度，有力地配合了生产竞赛和标准工作法的推行。
    天津许多私营工厂也由于已经订立劳资集体合同、劳资关系渐趋正常，生产得到了发展。永利化学公司一月份产碱四千八百吨，超过去年最高纪录的百分之八。恒源纱厂布的产量较去年十二月提高百分之六．九，纱的产量提高百分之三，并新添布机四十八台，扩大了生产能力。其他如利中盐厂、中天电厂、仁立毛织公司等多家也都完成或超过了一月份的生产计划。东亚企业公司去年十二月份的产量较四月份的产量降低了百分之十三。主要原因是资方没有合理地改善工厂管理，因而工人生产情绪不高。今年一月份劳资举行了协商会议，解决了劳资间六十多项积存的问题，该厂产量即迅速提高。该厂织麻部每台织机由平均日产一百二十码增至一百六十码，最高的曾达二百二十码。麻袋产量，由于增辟夜班的结果，从日产三千余条增至七千余条。此外，解决了劳资争议的星星造纸厂，产量也提高了百分之二十，成本减低了百分之二十五。
