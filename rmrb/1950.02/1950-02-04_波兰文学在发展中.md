　　Polish Literature in Development
    The economy of People's Democratic Poland is developing rapidly, and the whole country is full of construction enthusiasm; the development of Polish literature, deeply rooted in the soil of the motherland, is inseparable from the construction of People's Democratic Poland.
    In 1949, the United Conference of the Polish Workers' Party passed a declaration, putting forward to the people of the whole country the "great historical task of laying the foundation for the socialist system in Poland." This resolution was enthusiastically supported by the people of the whole country. Polish writers gained enthusiasm and confidence in the future from the resolution. The Polish Writers' Association said explicitly in its letter of respect to the conference that the conference expressed "the most sincere hope of all those engaged in creation in Polish society. The solidarity of the Polish working class guarantees the rapid reconstruction of the country and the vigorous development of Polish culture."
    A month later, a national conference of Polish writers was held in Szczecin. The most outstanding representatives of Polish literature movingly reflected the construction enthusiasm permeating the country; no one complained about the lack of subject matter, because they all personally and actively participated in the construction of New Poland.
    The central issue of the conference was the issue of realism in creation, that is, how to truthfully and profoundly depict modern Poland and how to highly serve the construction of the country. The writers launched a discussion on this issue, on the one hand, studying the experience of Soviet literature, and on the other hand, based on the specific situation of social development in Poland.
    Soviet writers Korniychuk and Sofronov, who attended the conference, reported on the creative experience and future of Soviet literature, pointed out the role of criticism and self-criticism in Soviet literature, and reminded everyone to understand socialist realism and its incompatibility with dogmatism. These reports were of great help to Polish writers.
    In the report of Polish writer Żółkiewski, it was emphasized that writers can only grasp the subject matter and become sincere realists in order to discover the spiritual treasures of the people and produce valuable works. Secondly, literary works must profoundly record the birth of New Poland and its new characters and social relations; Polish writers have only taken the first step in this regard, and should continue to develop in the future.
    The conference appropriately affirmed the achievements of New Poland's writers and works, and also seriously pointed out the shortcomings. The first novel depicting construction, Putrament's "The Foundations," was considered not perfect enough, and everyone firmly believed that more and more powerful works depicting construction would appear in the future. Critics pointed out that some works depicting the Polish people's struggle against fascist aggressors, because the writers did not delve into life and were influenced by naturalism, nihilism, or pessimism, could not reflect the indomitable will and heroic deeds of the outstanding Polish people under strict tests in literary works, and more or less aroused pessimistic emotions. The root cause of these writers is imitating the decadent modern Western European literature and American literature, and Polish progressive writers are fighting against this bad trend.
    However, Polish literature has its great realistic tradition; at the same time, the writers also recognize that "the urgent theme of this generation is the construction of people's democracy." At the Szczecin conference, the words of Rudnicki, the author of "Old and New," the most widely circulated novel in New Poland, were brought up, and he said that the task of Polish literature is "to depict the construction of socialism through artistic images." The excellent Polish writers are all working hard for this sentence. (Xiao Gui)

### 波兰文学在发展中

　　波兰文学在发展中
    人民民主波兰的经济正在大步向前发展，全国充满着建设的热情；深深生根在祖国土壤里的波兰文学的发展，是和人民民主波兰的建设分不开的。
    一九四九年波兰工人党派联合会议通过一项宣言，向全国人民提出了“在波兰为社会主义制度打下基础的伟大历史任务”。这决议受到全国人民热烈拥护。波兰作家们则从决议里得到了热情和对未来的信心。波兰作家协会向会议致敬的信里明确地说：这会议表现了“波兰社会一切从事创造最真诚的希望。波兰工人阶级的团结一致保证了国家迅速的重建和波兰文化的蓬勃发展”。
    一个月以后，全国规模的波兰作家会议在斯捷申举行了。波兰文学最优秀的代表们在那里动人地反映了迷漫全国的建设热情；没有人为缺少题材而抱怨，因为他们都亲身积极地参加了新波兰的建设工作。
    会议的中心问题是创作上的写实主义问题，就是怎样真实而深刻地描绘现代波兰，怎样高度为国家的建设而服务的问题。作家们对这问题展开了讨论，他们一方面研究苏联文学的经验，一方面根据波兰社会发展中的具体情况。
    出席会议的苏联作家柯纳朱克和索夫洛诺夫报告了苏联文学的创作经验及其前途，指出批评与自我批评对苏联文学所起的作用，并提醒大家要了解社会主义的写实主义，和它与教条主义的不相容。这些报告对波兰作家有很大的帮助。
    在波兰作家佐克夫斯基的报告里，着重地提出了作家们只有紧紧抓住题材，成为真诚的写实主义者，才能发掘人民精神上的宝藏，产生有价值的作品。其次，文学作品必须深刻地记述新波兰的诞生，及其新的人物和社会关系；波兰作家在这方面才走了第一步，以后应当继续向前发展。
    会议上对新波兰的作家和作品确当地肯定了成绩而又严肃地指出了缺点。第一部描写建设的小说，普特立可夫斯基的“基础”被认为不够完美，大家深信以后将有更多更有力的写建设的作品出现。批评家们指出，某些描写波兰人民反抗法西斯侵略者斗争的作品，由于作家没有深入生活，并受了自然主义，虚无主义或悲观主义的影响，因此不能把波兰优秀人民在严格考验下所表现的不屈的意志及英勇的事迹反映到文学作品里来，而或多或少地引起悲观情绪。这些作家的病根是模仿颓废的现代西欧文学和美国文学，波兰进步作家们正向这不良倾向作斗争。
    但是，波兰的文学是有其伟大的写实的传统；同时，作家们也都认识“这一代的迫切的主题是人民民主的建设”。在斯捷申会议上，新波兰流传最广的小说“旧与新”的作者，鲁德尼基的话被提了出来，他说波兰文学的任务是“通过艺术的形象来描绘社会主义的建设”。波兰的优秀作家们都在为这句话而努力。（小规）
