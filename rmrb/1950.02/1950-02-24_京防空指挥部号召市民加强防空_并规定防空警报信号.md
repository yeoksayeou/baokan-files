[Beijing News] In order to prevent sabotage by American-Chiang Kai-shek planes and protect the security of the capital, the Beijing Air Defense Command issued a notice yesterday (the 23rd), calling on all citizens to actively strengthen air defense work and stipulating air raid alarm signals. The notice is as follows:

Fellow citizens of Beijing:

Under the direction of American imperialism, the remnant bandit gangs of the Kuomintang reactionaries recently carried out indiscriminate bombing of Shanghai and Nanjing. They are using this despicable and shameless means to make a last-ditch struggle. This has profoundly taught us that we must thoroughly eliminate the Kuomintang remnants, liberate Taiwan, the Zhoushan Islands, Hainan Island, and Tibet, and eliminate the reactionary remnants from all of China in order to guarantee the survival and construction of the Chinese people. Therefore, we must actively support the front lines in order to quickly eliminate the enemy's remaining forces and destroy the enemy's last military bases. At the same time, in order to prevent sabotage by American-Chiang Kai-shek planes, the people of our capital must also actively strengthen air defense work: First, strengthen air defense facilities, repair air raid shelters, prepare blackout covers, and camouflage key targets; second, strengthen fire prevention and firefighting work, store sand and water, and inspect fire extinguishers; third, strengthen public security work to prevent special agents from signaling and exposing targets and spreading rumors to confuse the public; fourth, strictly enforce light control; fifth, do not panic, run around, or bump into things upon hearing the alarm, and obey the command of air defense personnel.

Air Raid Alarm Signals

(1) Preparatory alarm: Thirty seconds, (pause four seconds), thirty seconds; Auxiliary signal: one red light is hung.
(2) Emergency alarm: Thirty seconds, (pause four seconds), five seconds, (pause four seconds), five seconds; Auxiliary signal: two red lights are hung.
(3) Imminent air raid alarm: Five seconds per interval; Auxiliary signal: two red lights are lowered.
(4) All clear: Three minutes; Auxiliary signal: two green lights are hung.
