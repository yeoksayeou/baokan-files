　　Taiwan Youth and Students Persist in Heroic Struggle
　　Xie Bangding
　　Since February 28, 1947, the Kuomintang reactionaries have carried out a frenzied massacre in Taiwan against Taiwanese compatriots who opposed the Kuomintang's corrupt and fascist rule. Tens of thousands of Taiwanese youth and students were collectively shot dead with machine guns, stabbed to death with bayonets, and thrown into the sea in sacks. Faced with these many brutal atrocities, the youth and students of Taiwan did not yield. On the contrary, they, together with their Taiwanese compatriots, continued to persist in and launch heroic struggles in the cities and also went into the countryside and deep mountains. Even as the Kuomintang bandit gang suffered fatal blows on the mainland and fled to Taiwan one after another, and the bloody terrorist rule in Taiwan intensified, Taiwanese youth and students still continuously held "anti-hunger" and "anti-persecution" movements in the middle of last year, and in May of last year, they established the Taiwan Provincial Federation of University and Middle School Students, issued a declaration of establishment, and issued a further call to battle to Taiwanese compatriots and youth. The firm fighting will and heroic fighting actions of the students in Taiwan have given great encouragement to the students throughout the country, and the students throughout the country are deeply concerned about them and their struggle.
　　The resolution of the 14th Second Enlarged Executive Committee of the All-China Students' Federation recently pointed out: "At present, the remaining forces of the Kuomintang bandit gang are still entrenched in Taiwan, Hainan Island, and Tibet. Under the support of US imperialism, it is still carrying out harassment and sabotage, attempting to make a comeback. Students throughout the country should actively respond to the call of the People's Government and support the People's Liberation Army to quickly liberate Taiwan, Hainan Island, and Tibet." The resolution also called on: "Students in these areas, in particular, should unite as one and, together with the local people, fight the reactionaries in various ways and prepare to welcome liberation. We believe that Chinese students with revolutionary traditions are fully capable of completing this glorious task. The Taiwanese students, who have been tested by the serious struggle of the "February 28th" incident, will play a significant role in the liberation struggle. As we commemorate the third anniversary of the "February 28th" incident today with infinite sorrow, we firmly believe that the doomsday of the Kuomintang remnant bandit gang in Taiwan is at hand. Soon, the students in Taiwan will join the students across the country in the cheers of Taiwan's liberation, and together with the students across the country, under the leadership of Chairman Mao of the Central People's Government, participate in the construction of our great and solemn new China."

　　台湾青年学生们坚持着英勇斗争
　　谢邦定
    从一九四七年二月二十八日起，国民党反动派在台湾对反对国民党贪污法西斯统治的台湾同胞，进行了疯狂大屠杀。成千成万台湾青年学生，被用机枪集体射杀，被用刺刀戳死，被装入麻袋投进海中。面对着这许多残酷的暴行，台湾的青年学生没有屈服。相反地，他们和台湾同胞一道，在城市中，并且走进了农村和深山，继续坚持和展开了英勇的斗争。就在国民党匪帮在大陆上遭受了致命的打击、纷纷向台湾逃窜，台湾血腥的特务统治变本加厉的时候，台湾青年学生在去年中仍连续举行“反饥饿”“反迫害”运动，并于去年五月成立了台湾全省大中学生联合会，发表了成立宣言，向台湾同胞和青年发出了进一步的战斗号召。台湾同学们这样坚决的斗争意志和英勇的斗争行动，给予我们全国同学很大的鼓励，全国同学深切地关怀着他们和他们的斗争。
    最近中华全国学生联合会第十四届第二次扩大执委会决议中指出：“现在国民党匪帮的残余力量尚盘踞在台湾、海南岛、西藏。它在美帝国主义扶植之下，仍在进行骚扰破坏，妄图卷土重来，全国同学应积极响应人民政府的号召，支援人民解放军迅速解放台湾、海南岛、西藏。”决议同时号召：“这些地区的同学，尤应团结一致，和当地人民一道，以各种方式向反动派进行斗争，准备迎接解放。我们相信，有着革命传统的中国学生，是完全能够完成这一光荣任务的。经过“二·二八”严重斗争考验的台湾同学，将会在解放斗争中发挥他们重大的作用。当我们今天以无限沉痛的心情来纪念“二·二八”三周年的时候，我们坚信，在台湾的国民党残余匪帮的末日就在眼前了。不久，台湾的同学将在欢呼台湾解放声中，与全国同学汇合，与全国同学一道，在中央人民政府毛主席的领导下，参加到建设我们伟大庄严的新中国的队伍中来。
