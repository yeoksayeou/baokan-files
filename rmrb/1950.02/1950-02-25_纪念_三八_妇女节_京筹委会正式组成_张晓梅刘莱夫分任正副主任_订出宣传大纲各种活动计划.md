[Beijing News] The Beijing Municipal Organizing Committee for the Commemoration of "March 8th" International Working Women's Day was officially established on the 22nd. The Organizing Committee is composed of eight units, including the Beijing Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, the Preparatory Committee of the Farmers' Association, the Beijing Working Committee of the New Democratic Youth League, the Preparatory Committee of the Democratic Youth Federation, the Student Federation, the Preparatory Committee of the Education Workers' Union, the Mass Literature and Art Creation Research Association, and the Democratic Women's Federation. The Organizing Committee held a meeting on the 22nd to discuss specific plans for commemorating "March 8th" Day based on the joint notice from the All-China Federation of Trade Unions and other five organizations, and passed the "Notice on Commemorating 'March 8th' Day in Beijing" and the propaganda outline. At the meeting, Zhang Xiaomei (Women's Federation) was elected as the director of the Beijing Municipal Organizing Committee for Commemorating "March 8th" International Working Women's Day, and Liu Laifu (Federation of Trade Unions) was elected as the deputy director. The office officially opened on the same day. The Organizing Committee decided that March 1st to 8th would be "March 8th" Propaganda Week, and planned to hold the following activities: 1. Hold a representative commemorative meeting. 2. Cooperate with relevant authorities to screen and perform films, dramas, and folk arts related to women around "March 8th" Day. 3. Invite heads of various groups to give speeches and broadcasts during "March 8th" Propaganda Week. The time, location, and specific methods of the above activities will be notified separately. On the 23rd, the committee issued the "Notice on Commemorating 'March 8th' International Working Women's Day in Beijing." The notice first called on all women in the city to take practical actions to earnestly implement the joint notice of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions and other five organizations, and strive to commemorate this year's "March 8th" Day with better achievements in production, work, and study. The notice instructed all factories, schools, institutions, organizations, and districts to select appropriate times during "March 8th" Propaganda Week, according to their specific circumstances, to hold small-scale, in-depth commemorative activities, such as holding symposiums, lectures, commemorative meetings, or recreational activities. Units that originally published periodicals, wall newspapers, or blackboards should issue special issues on "March 8th." Female workers in all factories should, under possible conditions, choose one day during "March 8th" Propaganda Week as a production day to commemorate "March 8th" Women's Day, and strive to create new production records. Students, teachers, and intellectual women should earnestly study the "Brief History of March 8th" and the joint notice of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions and other five organizations during "March 8th" Propaganda Week, and conduct discussions in conjunction with the specific work of their positions. "March 8th" Day lectures should be given in women's literacy classes and adult night schools with women (the number of times and focus are determined by themselves). The content of the propaganda should be mainly based on the "Propaganda Outline for 'March 8th' International Working Women's Day" issued by the committee, and the explanations should be simple and clear, suitable for the mass level of the unit. At the same time, without hindering production and learning, small-scale worker-student get-togethers or mutual visits can be held between individual factories and schools. The notice finally stated that after receiving this notice, all factories, schools, institutions, and organizations are expected to make specific plans for their unit to commemorate "March 8th" Day in accordance with the spirit of this notice, contact the committee, and organize reports on the activities at any time. All units should submit a report on the work, gains, experiences, and mass reflections of commemorating "March 8th" Day to the committee before March 15th. The committee's office is located at No. 69, Donghuamen Street, Beijing Municipal Democratic Women's Federation. Telephone numbers are 5-4283 and 5-4958.
