The Hungarian "Szabad Szó" Comments

The Hungarian National Peasants' Party organ "Szabad Szó" commented on the Sino-Soviet Treaty, stating: This treaty "deals an effective blow to the policies of the imperialists who are preparing for a third world war." The Hungarian "Szabad Nép" stated: The Sino-Soviet Treaty contains a clear warning to the imperialists. Both contracting parties have guaranteed to prevent the resurgence of aggression and the destruction of peace. They have declared that they will do everything possible to consolidate peace and security. This treaty will show the oppressed nations of Asia and around the world how meaningful the friendship and support of the Soviet Union is, and how significant it is for any nation to form an alliance with the world's first socialist country. This treaty will undoubtedly spark a new upsurge in the struggle for peace and draw another batch of millions of working people into the fight against the new war that is being prepared.

According to a Polish press agency report, the Polish government organ "Rzeczpospolita" commented on the Sino-Soviet alliance treaty in an editorial entitled "New and Powerful Link" on the 18th, stating: China has become a powerful force in the socialist camp. The signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty greatly strengthens the world peace camp. In accordance with its traditional policy, the Soviet Union has granted China a considerable amount of credit at a very low interest rate for the purchase of production equipment. This assistance is a concrete contribution to expanding the economic potential of the People's China. Every machine, every tractor, every car supplied by the Soviet Union means strengthening China—strengthening the peace camp.

According to another Polish press agency report, the Polish Armed Forces organ "Żołnierz Wolności" wrote in a special article entitled "The Alliance Between Two Great Nations Brings the Complete Victory of the Forces of Peace Closer": In the situation where Japan has become an American military base, in the face of the secret plan to establish an army of 500,000 under the guise of "police force" to rearm Japan, and in the context of MacArthur's increasingly intensified militarist activities, the alliance established by the Soviet Union and China, representing 700 million people, constitutes a strong factor in strengthening and ensuring peace. The report concluded that the two largest nations in the world have signed a treaty of friendship, alliance, and mutual assistance, which means that the strength of the camp of billions of working people guarding peace has been further consolidated and increased.

　　中苏新条约将引起争取和平的新高潮
    匈光明报评论
    匈牙利民族农民党机关报《自由谈》评论中苏条约称：这个条约“给予正在准备第三次世界大战的帝国主义者的政策以有效的打击。”匈牙利《光明》报称：中苏条约包含着对帝国主义者的明白的警告。缔约国双方已保证防止侵略之再起和和平之遭受破坏。他们已经宣布：他们将竭尽所能以巩固和平与安全。这一条约将向亚洲及世界各地的被压迫民族表明：苏联的友谊与支持有何等的意义，与世界上第一个社会主义国家缔结同盟，对任何一个民族来说，有何等的意义。这一条约无疑地将引起争取和平的新高潮，并把另一批数以百万计的劳动人民，卷入反对正在准备的新战争的斗争中去。
    波兰武装部队机关报《武装的波兰》在题为《两大民族之间的同盟使得和平力量的完全胜利更加接近》的专文中写道：在日本变成美国军事基地的情况下，在面临以“警察队”为掩护，建立五十万军队来重新武装日本的秘密计划下，在麦克阿瑟的军国主义活动日益加紧的情况下，苏联和中国所建立的代表七亿人民的同盟，构成了加强和确保和平的强有力的因素。该报结语称，世界上最大的两个民族，业已签订了友好同盟互助条约，这意味着警卫和平的亿万劳动人民的阵营的力量，已获得进一步的巩固与增长。
    另据波兰通讯社消息，波兰政府机关报《共和报》十八日在题为《新的与有力的环节》的社论中评论中苏同盟条约称：中国已变成社会主义阵营中一个强大的力量。中苏条约的签订，大大地加强了世界和平阵营。苏联遵照他的传统政策，以很低的利息给予中国相当数量的信用贷款，作为购买生产设备之用。这种援助对于扩大人民中国的经济潜力，是一个具体的贡献。苏联所供应的每一架机器，每一架拖拉机，每一辆汽车，都意味着加强中国——加强和平阵营。
