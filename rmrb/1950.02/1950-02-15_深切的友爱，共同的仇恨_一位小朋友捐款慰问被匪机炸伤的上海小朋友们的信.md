Deep Friendship, Common Hatred
    —A Child's Donation to Console Shanghai Children Injured by Bandit Aircraft

    Editor's Note: We have already sent the donation to the Shanghai Municipal People's Government to be forwarded to the injured children.

To the Shanghai Children Injured by Bandit Aircraft:
    I felt very uneasy upon hearing the news of your suffering. In addition to hating the inhumanity of the American-Chiang bandits, I extend my heartfelt condolences to you. I hope you will recuperate well, recover your health soon, and study hard; and remember well that the disaster you have suffered this time was inflicted on you by the American imperialists and the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang. Never forget revenge! Soon Taiwan will be liberated, and you will no longer have to worry about bandit planes bombing you indiscriminately. I wish you a speedy recovery!
                 Your little friend from Beijing, February 13th

Letter attached to the journal for the Editorial Department:
    I was extremely angry when I saw the news on the 6th of this month that American-Chiang bandit planes indiscriminately bombed the people of Shanghai, and I was very concerned about the suffering compatriots, especially the children, and saddened by their unfortunate experience. In addition to writing to express my condolences, I am sending People's Currency 20,000 yuan with this letter, and I would like you to forward it to the suffering children in Shanghai. I know that this amount of money is too little, but it also expresses our protest against the American-Chiang bandits and our condolences to the children in Shanghai. With best regards!

　　深切的友爱，共同的仇恨
    ——一位小朋友捐款慰问被匪机炸伤的上海小朋友们的信
    编者按：捐款我们已寄上海市人民政府转受伤的小朋友们。被匪机炸伤的上海小朋友们：
    我听到了你们受难的消息，心里十分不安。除了痛恨美蒋匪帮的惨无人道之外，特向你们致亲切的慰问，希望你们好好的疗养，早日恢复健康，努力学习；并且牢牢记住，你们这次遭受的灾难，是美帝国主义者和蒋介石匪帮加给你们的。千万别忘掉复仇啊！不久台湾也将获得解放，再也不用担心匪机来滥炸你们了。祝你们早日恢复健康！
                  你们的小朋友自北京寄  二月十三日
        附给本刊的信编辑同志：
    我看到了本月六日美蒋匪机滥炸上海人民的消息，愤怒异常，对受难的同胞们十分挂念，尤其挂念着小朋友们，为他们的不幸遭遇而悲伤。除了写信慰问之外，随信送上人民券二万元，请你们转交上海受难的小朋友们。我知道这一点钱太少，但也表示我们对美蒋匪帮的抗议和对上海小朋友们的慰问。此致敬礼！
