　　Shandong's State-Owned Coal Mines Achieve Pre-War Production Levels
    Increased Production Attributed to Improved Safety Measures, Enhanced Worker Awareness, and Leading Role of Party and League Members.
    [Report from this newspaper] Through vigorous restoration efforts over the past year, Shandong Province's state-owned coal mines have restored 33 mines (excluding smaller ones). The total output has recovered to an average of over 42% of the peak production during the Japanese occupation and has reached slightly over 100% of pre-war production levels. The production efficiency of each mine is increasing month by month. In September of last year, the provincial average production rate was 0.26 tons; in October, it was 0.28 tons; and by December, it had further increased to 0.33 tons, a 27% increase compared to September.

    Among the state-owned coal mines, the Fangzi, Jiawang, and Xihe mines, which were not damaged by the Kuomintang bandit troops or sustained only minor damage, have exceeded their daily output during the Japanese occupation. Fangzi Coal Mine exceeded it by 180%, Jiawang by 50%, and Xihe by 30%. The Xinbo Coal Mine, which was damaged by the Kuomintang bandit troops, has also exceeded pre-war production by 150% and reached 80% of the level during the Japanese occupation. The Hongshan Coal Mine, which suffered even more severe damage than Xinbo Coal Mine and was flooded in August of last year, has now reached 95% of its pre-war production.

    Universal Attention to Safety and Security
    Democratic Management of Factories Leads to Increased Worker Awareness
    The main reasons for the rapid recovery and development of Shandong's state-owned coal mines are as follows:

    1. Universal attention has been paid to safety and security: After the flooding incident at the Hongshan Coal Mine in August of last year, it drew widespread attention to safety and security in various mines, and various safety measures were implemented. For example, the Chejiazhuang No. 7 well of the Hongshan Coal Mine has built a large-capacity water storage and added drainage equipment. In addition to handling the daily water inflow at the bottom of the well, the drainage equipment has the capacity to remove an additional 2,184 tons of water. In addition, the number of lights underground has doubled, a patrol inspection system has been established, cadres personally inspect safety equipment daily, and workers promptly report conditions inside the mine. In addition to adding lights underground, the Jiawang Coal Mine has replaced unstable shed pillars and added water pumps, waterproof doors, waterproof walls, and fans. After a long-term investigation and research by specialists, the Xinbo Coal Mine has removed over 10,000 tons of stored water from two old wells and expanded the water storage to prevent unexpected events. At the same time, the mine has reorganized the underground passages and implemented separate lanes for people and vehicles, avoiding the risk of coal cars hitting people. Due to the above safety measures, worker casualties in various mines have gradually decreased. The casualty rate at the Fangzi Mine in October decreased by 18.6% compared to September. Xinbo Mine had no work-related deaths in November, and work-related injuries also decreased by 38% compared to October. Workers' enthusiasm for production has greatly increased.

    2. The increasing awareness of workers is an important guarantee for increasing production. In the early days of liberation, workers in the province's state-owned coal mines continuously made inventions and improvements in production. Later, with the development of trade union work, some coal mines (such as Xinbo and Jiawang) also established democratic management institutions – Mine Management Committees – promoting democracy, and thus further enhancing workers' enthusiasm for production. In June of last year, the Xinbo Coal Mine launched a "one suggestion" campaign, and workers provided more than 200 suggestions for the construction of the mine, greatly promoting the mine's construction work. In the meritorious service campaign of October last year, workers at the Fangzi Mine increased their daily output by 27% compared to September. The direct coal mining rate exceeded the original standard (0.45 tons) by 0.091 tons, reaching 0.541 tons of coal mined per person per day. After the production competition at the Xinbo Coal Mine, the total coal mining rate increased from 0.353 tons in September to 0.412 tons in December.

    3. In the rapid recovery and development of the production movement, the exemplary actions of Communist Party members and New Democratic Youth League members have played a great role in promoting it. Yao Wenbin, a Party member of the Xinbo No. 1 Coal Mining Team, in addition to performing his own work, took every opportunity to educate workers, help them solve difficulties, and unite them to work hard in production. When a new pit being mined at the Suncun Coal Mine was in danger of collapsing, League members took the lead in rescuing more than 80 tons of coal. At present, some of the Communist Party branches in various mines in the province have been made public, making the connection between the Party and the masses closer and further uniting all employees to strive for the development of production.

　　山东各公营煤矿产量达到战前水平
    产量提高的原因是：改进防险保安工作、提高工人觉悟、党团员起带头作用。
    【本报讯】山东省各公营煤矿经过去年一年的大力恢复，矿井已恢复三十三座（不包括规模小的矿井），总产量平均已恢复到日寇侵占时期最高产量的百分之四十二以上，达到抗战前产量的百分之一百强。各矿生产效率逐月上升。去年九月份，全省各煤矿总平均生产率为○．二六吨，十月份为○．二八吨，到十二月份更增至○．三三吨，较九月份又提高了百分之二十七。
    在各公营煤矿中，未遭国民党匪军破坏的坊子、贾汪及破坏较轻的西河等三矿，日产量已超过日寇侵占时期。其中坊子煤矿超过百分之一百八十，贾汪超过百分之五十，西河超过百分之三十。曾遭国民党匪军破坏的新博煤矿，产量也已经超过战前一倍半，并达到日寇侵占时期的百分之八十。破坏较新博煤矿更严重，在去年八月又遭水淹的洪山煤矿，产量现已达到战前的百分之九十五。
    普遍注意防险  保护安全工作
    民主管理工厂  工人觉悟提高
    山东公营煤矿生产得以迅速恢复与发展其主要原因如下：
    一、普遍注意了防险保安工作：自去年八月份洪山煤矿水淹事件发生后，即引起了各矿对防险保安工作的普遍注意，各矿都进行了各种保安措施。如洪山煤矿之车家庄七号井，已建设了容量很大的水仓，并增加了排水设备，该排水设备除了担负排除每天井底涌出的水量外，尚有排除二千一百八十四吨水量的余力。此外井下增加了电灯一倍，建立了巡回督检制度，干部每天亲自下井检查保安设备，工人也及时报告井内情况。贾汪煤矿除在井下添设了电灯外，并抽换了不牢固的棚柱，增设水泵、防水门、防水墙、送风机等。新博煤矿经过专人长期调查研究后，已将两个古井的万余吨存水分别割除，并扩大了水仓，以防不测。同时，该矿整理了井下通道，实行人车分道，避免了煤车碰人的危险。由于采取了以上各种保安措施，各矿工人伤亡已逐渐减少。坊子矿十月份的伤亡率，较九月份减少百分之十八．六。新博矿十一月份无一工亡，工伤亦较十月份减少百分之三十八。工人生产情绪大为提高。
    二、工人觉悟日益提高，是提高产量的重要保证。解放初期，该省各公营煤矿工人即不断进行创造发明、改进生产；以后工会工作开展，有些煤矿（如新博、贾汪）并建立了民主管理机构——矿山管理委员会，发扬了民主，因此工人生产的积极性更进一步提高。去年六月间，新博煤矿开展了“一个意见”运动，工人对建设矿山提供了二百多条意见，使该矿建设工作大大推进一步。坊子矿工人在去年十月的立功运动中，使日产量较九月份增加了百分之二十七，直接工采煤率超过原定标准（○．四五吨）○．○九一吨，达到每人每天采煤○．五四一吨。新博煤矿经过生产竞赛后，全矿总采煤率由九月份的○．三五三吨，提高到十二月份的○．四一二吨。
    三、在迅速恢复与发展生产运动中，中共党员与新民主主义青年团员的模范行动，起了极大的推动作用。新博第一采炭所党员姚文斌，除担任本身工作外，一有机会就对工人进行教育，帮助工人解决困难，团结工人努力生产。孙村煤矿开采之新坑发生塌陷危险时，团员带头抢出煤炭八十余吨。现该省各矿山中共支部部分已经公开，使党与群众的联系更加密切，进一步团结了全体职工为发展生产而努力。
