Xinhua News Agency, Prague, February 2nd: The Secretariat of the International Organization of Journalists (IOJ) announced on January 30th that the IOJ's Third Congress will be held in Paris from March 24th to 26th.

　　This decision was made based on a proposal by the French Journalists' Association, affiliated with the French General Confederation of Labor. The IOJ Secretariat stated that the March Congress will review the IOJ's past activities and draft a future program of work, and that the Congress will be an important milestone in the IOJ's activities. The Congress will also discuss the economic, social, and trade union positions of journalists in various countries around the world, as well as how journalists can participate in the world's struggle for peace.

　　The Congress was originally scheduled to be held in Brussels at the end of last year. However, the Belgian Journalists' Association, which had expressed its willingness to be responsible for preparing for the Congress at the 1947 Prague Congress (Second Congress), reneged on its promise at the last minute, preventing the Third Congress from being held in Brussels as scheduled.

　　Distinguished journalists from around the world and representatives of various international democratic organizations will attend the Paris Congress.

　　国际新闻记者协会订下月开代表大会
    将讨论记者如何参加和平斗争
    【新华社布拉格二日电】国际新闻记者协会秘书处于一月三十日宣布：国际新闻记者协会第三次代表大会，定于三月二十四日至二十六日在巴黎举行。
    这一决定，系根据法国总工会所属法国记者协会的提议。国际记者协会秘书处声明称：三月代表大会将检讨国际记协过去的活动，并草拟将来的工作纲领，大会将成为国际记协活动中的重要里程碑。大会亦将讨论世界各国记者对经济、社会与工会的立场以及新闻记者如何参加世界争取和平的斗争。
    此次代表大会原定去年底在布鲁塞尔举行，但是，在一九四七年布拉格代表大会（第二次代表大会）上曾表示愿负责筹备召开此次大会的比利时记者协会，竟在最后五分钟背信爽约，因而使第三次代表大会不能在布鲁塞尔如期举行。
    巴黎代表大会将有世界各地杰出的记者及各国际民主组织的代表出席。
