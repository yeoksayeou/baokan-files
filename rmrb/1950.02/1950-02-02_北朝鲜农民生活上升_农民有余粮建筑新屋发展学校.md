　　North Korean Farmers' Living Standards Rise
    Farmers Have Surplus Grain to Build New Houses and Develop Schools
    Chairman Kim used survey materials from forty-two villages and two thousand four hundred and sixty-six farm households to illustrate the improvement in the living standards of North Korean farmers over the past four years. He said: In these forty-two villages, the total grain harvest in 1944 was 117,000 bags (at one *shi* per bag), which increased to 150,000 bags in 1949. In 1944, after the Japanese government forced "contributions" and collected land rent, only over 8,000 bags remained. In 1949, after paying taxes in kind to the democratic government, in addition to guaranteeing all food rations, they had more than 22,000 bags for farmers to freely trade, and 3,000 bags of surplus grain. In addition, 18 percent of farmers built new houses and purchased 628 more head of cattle. Due to the improvement of material life, their cultural life has also developed rapidly. In 1949, primary schools increased sevenfold compared to 1944, the number of students increased two and a half times, middle school students increased tenfold, and college students increased sixfold. Rural clubs and libraries increased forty-eight times. Chairman Kim pointed out that the reason for obtaining the above achievements is due to the improvement of farmers' production enthusiasm after being allocated land and the correct leadership of government cadres at all levels.
    Regarding the tasks for 1950, Chairman Kim said: The basic requirement for this year is: the total grain output should increase by 15.9 percent, cattle should increase by 17 percent, pigs should increase by 26.5 percent, and sheep should increase by 16.8 percent. As for how to complete this task, he said: First, it is necessary to promote new agricultural tools and new farming methods, and widely carry out publicity and education. To this end, all cadres in the agricultural and forestry departments must systematically study the advanced technologies and agronomic experiences of the Soviet Union. He said: In addition to the Ministry of Industry currently planning to manufacture a large number of new agricultural tools, it is also necessary to promote the Soviet Union's new-style ploughshares and try to use tractors for cultivation. To this end, the government should set up mechanical agricultural tool "rental farms" this year in several dry land areas that can be cultivated with tractors (Note: Dry land in North Korea accounts for 64.4 percent, and paddy fields account for 35.6 percent). Farmers will pay a certain price to rent new agricultural tools, allowing farmers to recognize the benefits of using tractors through experimentation. Chairman Kim also pointed out that cadres of government organs at all levels should strengthen the organization and leadership of farmers, and should not let them go their own way in autumn cultivation, sowing, weeding or harvesting. Chairman Kim called on all cadres attending the meeting to further enhance their sense of responsibility for the country's undertakings, strengthen accurate statistical work, and strive to complete the 1950 plan.

　　北朝鲜农民生活上升
    农民有余粮建筑新屋发展学校
    金主席继以四十二个农村二千四百六十六户农家最近的调查材料，来说明四年来北朝鲜农民生活上升的情况。他说：这四十二个农村，一九四四年米谷的总收获量是十一万七千包（按每包一石），一九四九年则增加到十五万包。一九四四年日本政府强迫“供出”和缴纳地租后，全部剩下仅八千余包。而在一九四九年，他们向民主政府缴纳现物税后，除了保证全部食粮外，尚有二万二千余包由农民自由买卖，并有三千包余粮。此外，还有百分之十八的农户，盖了新房屋，增购了耕牛六百二十八头。由于物质生活的提高，他们的文化生活也飞跃地发展着。一九四九年，初等学校比一九四四年增加了七倍，学生增加了两倍半，中学生增加了十倍，大学生增加了六倍。农村俱乐部、图书室增加了四十八倍。金主席指出，获得以上成绩的原因，是由于农民分得土地后生产情绪的提高和政府各级干部的正确领导。
    关于一九五○年的任务，金主席说：今年的基本要求是：米谷总产量增加百分之十五点九，牛增加百分之十七，猪增加百分之二十六点五，绵羊增加百分之十六点八。至于如何完成这一任务，他说：首先要推广新农具和新农作法，广泛地展开宣传教育。为此，农林部门的全体干部，必须有组织有步骤地学习苏联的先进技术和农艺经验。他说：除产业部现正计划制造大批的新农具外，还要推行苏联的新式犁铧，并试用拖拉机耕种。为此，政府今年应在若干能用拖拉机耕种的旱田区（按：北朝鲜旱田占百分之六十四点四，水田占百分之三十五点六）设立机械农具“赁耕所”，由农民出一定代价，租用新农具，让农民从实验中认识使用拖拉机的好处。金主席同时指出，各级政权机关干部，应加强对农民的组织领导，无论秋耕、播种或锄草收割，都不能任其自流。金主席号召全体到会干部，要进一步提高对国家事业的责任心，加强精确的统计工作，为完成一九五○年的计划而斗争。
