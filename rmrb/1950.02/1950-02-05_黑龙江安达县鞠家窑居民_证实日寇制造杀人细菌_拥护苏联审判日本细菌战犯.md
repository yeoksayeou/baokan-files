Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 4th: The crime of the Japanese Imperial Army in manufacturing murderous bacteria has been confirmed by residents of Jujiayao, Anda County, Heilongjiang Province. Reporters visited the site of the former Japanese airfield near Jujiayao, which was the location where, as confessed by the war criminal Kiyoshi Kawashima during the trial of Japanese bacterial warfare criminals by the Soviet Primorsky Military District Tribunal on December 26th of last year, plague-carrying fleas were specially bred.

Jujiayao is located thirty-five li east of Anda County in Heilongjiang Province. Nearby is an airfield measuring seven li square, which was the place where Japanese fascist war criminals manufactured murderous bacteria. Although all the buildings and equipment were burned down by them before their surrender, the remaining traces and accusations from the local people fully confirm the heinous crimes of the Japanese fascists.

The desolate road from the village to the airfield is covered with weeds taller than the waist and patches of withered reeds. Local people testified that during the puppet Manchukuo period, the airfield was heavily guarded, and wooden signs with the words "Anyone who comes here will be killed without mercy" were erected all around. In the northern part of the airfield, there are several hill-like mounds and several deep gullies running vertically and horizontally, which are the locations of all the buildings and equipment. The Japanese burned them all down when they fled. Now there are still pieces of brick blackened by fire on the ground, as well as the remains of collapsed wells, stables, cattle pens, and pigsties. According to Yang, the local residents' group leader: "The houses built by the Japanese here had roofs only three chi [one chi is about 1/3 of a meter] above the ground, to prevent people from seeing them. Those trenches were the foundations of the houses at that time." Among these crisscrossing trenches, the deepest one is said to be the site of the factory that manufactured bacteria.

In 1944 and 1945, the Japanese army stationed in Anda, through the puppet Manchukuo Xingnong Cooperative, forcibly demanded live mice and "big-eyed thieves" (shorter and thicker than weasels, with dark brown-black fur) from each household, and demanded even more from students. More than 15,000 elementary school students throughout the county were forced to go to the fields to catch mice all day long, catching more than 100,000 in total, all of which were sent to Jujiayao airfield.

In addition, the Japanese also forced each student to donate half a jin [one jin is about 1/2 of a kilogram] of livestock hair and three liang [one liang is about 50 grams] of dried blood powder. When Japanese planes spread plague germs in the Changde area of Hunan Province, in addition to spreading grains infected with plague bacteria, they also dropped fleas infected with plague bacteria attached to wool balls and cotton balls. According to local hospital research, dried blood powder was used to cultivate bacteria.

Ju Shouchong, a resident of Xiujia Wopu, dozens of li away from the airfield, provided more conclusive evidence based on his personal experience. He said: I went to the airfield just after the "August 15th" liberation and saw many iron cages and boxes containing mice in a cave. In another large cave that had been burned, there were many magnetic bottles used for holding medicine, and the bottle mouths were sealed very tightly. Local residents testified that when building this airfield, the Japanese killed many Chinese people who were forced to build the airfield in order to maintain "secrecy." Li Yongting, a carpenter from Anda city, was once arrested to work as a carpenter. He said: "When it came to building the important parts inside, the Japanese did not use local people, but completely used those workers who were captured from Guannei [the region within the Shanhaiguan pass]. After the airfield was built, those workers were all killed."

The Japanese Imperial Army used Chinese people to experiment with frostbite and manufactured media that caused crops to be infected with black smut

The crimes of the Japanese fascists did not stop there. Local people also accused the Japanese Imperial Army of using Chinese people as experimental subjects for frostbite prevention and manufacturing crop-harming germs. Wu Yongxiang, a resident of Anda city, said: "In the winter of 1943, the Japanese arrested many poor people on Zhengya Street (the old site of the county seat), took them to deserted places at night and poured cold water on them, then dragged them outside to freeze. A few days later, six corpses were seen outside the South Gate and North Gate, all frozen with thick ice." Another resident, Zhang Fengjiu, also said: "In the same winter, the Japanese also arrested more than twenty beggars on Zhengya Street, drove them outside the city, stripped them naked, and froze them. After several such freezing and roasting, those beggars were all killed." At the shooting range southwest of the county seat, the Japanese also set up an experimental field for manufacturing crop germs. In 1944, when the wheat was in the milk stage, the Japanese forced students from various schools to inject the wheat with chemicals in the wheat fields, and as a result, the wheat all developed black smut disease. In that year and the following year, the Japanese also asked farmers in various villages for various types of corn smut to manufacture media that would harm crops.

The people of Anda County expressed enthusiastic support upon hearing the news of the Soviet Primorsky Military District Tribunal's trial of Japanese bacterial warfare criminals. For more than four years, epidemics of typhoid fever, horse disease, and cattle plague in the Anda area have never ceased. The people who have suffered from the poison left behind by the fascist beasts have recognized from painful memories that only the Soviet Union is a good friend who can help the Chinese people get rid of their suffering. They said: If it weren't for the Soviet Red Army liberating the Northeast, the people of our Anda County would probably have had their bones rotted clean by now. Today, we are united with the Soviet people and are not afraid of any bacterial warfare or atomic warfare. If the imperialists dare to try this again, they will really be asking for trouble!

### 黑龙江安达县鞠家窑居民  证实日寇制造杀人细菌  拥护苏联审判日本细菌战犯

　　黑龙江安达县鞠家窑居民
    证实日寇制造杀人细菌
    拥护苏联审判日本细菌战犯
    【新华社沈阳四日电】日寇制造杀人细菌的罪行，已获得黑龙江省安达县鞠家窑居民证实。记者曾访问了鞠家窑附近的日寇飞机场的旧地，那里就是苏联滨海军区军事法庭于去年十二月二十六日审判日本细菌战战犯时战犯川岛清所供称的专门繁殖鼠疫跳蚤的场所。
    鞠家窑在黑龙江省安达县城东三十五里，附近有一块方圆七里大的飞机场，这就是从前日本法西斯战犯们制造杀人细菌的地方。一切建筑与设备，虽然已被他们在投降前焚毁，但留下来的残迹和当地人民的控诉，都充分证实了日本法西斯的万恶罪行。
    从村庄到飞机场的荒道，满长着比腰深的蒿草和一片片干枯的芦苇。当地人民指证，在伪满时机场是被森严地警戒着，四周都树立有写着“谁上这来，格杀勿论”的木牌子。机场北部有几个丘陵状的山包和几条纵横的深沟，这就是所有的建筑和设备的所在地。日寇在逃走时把它们都烧光了。现在地上还有一块块被火烧黑的砖头，以及倾塌的水井、马棚、牛栏和猪圈的残迹。据当地居民组长杨老头说：“日本人在这里造的房子都是房顶离地面才三尺高，为的是怕人看见。那些一条条的壕沟，就是那时的房框子”。在这些纵横的壕沟中，有一条最深的，据说就是制造细菌的工厂的旧址。
    一九四四年和一九四五年，驻在安达的日军通过伪满兴农合作社，向各户强要活老鼠和大眼贼（比黄鼠狼短而粗，毛黧黑色），向学生要的更多。全县一万五千多小学生被迫成天到野外去捉老鼠，一共捉到十几万只，都送到鞠家窑飞机场去。
    另外，日本人还强迫每个学生献纳半斤牲畜毛和三两干血粉。日本飞机在湖南常德地区散布鼠疫菌的时候，除散布染有鼠疫细菌的谷物外，还把染有鼠疫菌的跳蚤附在羊毛球和棉花球里投下。据当地医院研究，干血粉是用来培育细菌的。
    离机场几十里的修家窝堡居民鞠守忠，以亲身经历更提供了确实的证据。他说：我在“八一五”刚解放时到飞机场去，看见有一个地洞里有许多铁笼子和箱子装着老鼠，另一个被火烧过的大地洞，有不少装药用的磁瓶子，瓶口封的很结实。当地居民指证，修筑这个飞机场的时候，日本人为了保持“秘密”，杀死了许多被驱迫修筑机场的中国人。安达城区木业工人李永庭，曾被抓去做过木工。他说：“当修到里边重要部分时，日本人就不用本地人修，而完全叫那些被从关里抓来的工人修。到飞机场修好了以后，那些工人都被杀害了。”
  日寇曾用中国人试验冻伤，并制造使庄稼染黑穗病的媒菌
    日本法西斯的罪行还不止此。当地人民还控诉日寇将中国人作预防冻伤的实验品和制造毒害庄稼病菌的罪行。安达城区的居民吴永祥说：“一九四三年冬天，日本人在正亚街（该县县城旧址）抓了不少穷人，晚上押到无人地方用凉水浇，再拉到外边冻，过不几天，在南门和北门外，看见有六具尸体，都冻着很厚的冰。”另一居民张凤九也说：“同一年冬天，日本人在正亚街还抓过二十多个要饭的乞丐，将他们赶到城外脱光衣服冻，冻了又用火烤。经过这样几次冻烤，那些乞丐都被弄死了。”在县城西南靶场，日本人还设了一个制造庄稼病菌的试验场。一九四四年麦子上浆时，日本人强迫各学校学生到麦地里用药水注射麦子，结果麦子都生了黑穗病。这一年和第二年，日本人又向各村农民要各种乌米，用来制造毒害庄稼的媒菌。
    安达县的人民听到苏联滨海军区军事法庭审判日本细菌战犯的消息，都表示热烈拥护。四年多来，流行性伤寒和马病、牛瘟在安达地区从未间断。身受法西斯野兽们遗留下的毒害的人民，从痛苦的记忆里认清，只有苏联才是帮助中国人民摆脱苦难的好朋友。他们说：要不是苏联红军解放东北，咱们安达县的人，现在恐怕连骨头都烂净了。今天我们和苏联人民联合一起，什么细菌战、原子战也不怕。要是帝国主义敢再来这一套，那真是自讨苦吃！
