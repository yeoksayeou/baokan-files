[Beijing News] People from all circles in Beijing expressed indignation at the Kuomintang remnants' bombing of Shanghai citizens. Liu Laifu, vice chairman of the Beijing Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, said: The Kuomintang bandit gang has repeatedly and frantically bombed Shanghai. This time, more than a thousand Shanghai residents were killed or injured, with tragic incidents of entire families being wiped out. This inhumane and bloody atrocity is a manifestation of the bandit gang's bestiality and death throes under the instruction and assistance of U.S. imperialism. In addition to expressing our condolences to the families of the deceased compatriots, we hope that the Shanghai compatriots, together with us Beijing workers, will turn hatred into strength, intensify production, actively support the People's Liberation Army, swiftly strike Taiwan, and capture Chiang Kai-shek alive to avenge the deceased compatriots.

Yan Jingyao, professor of sociology at Yenching University, said: This bombing of Shanghai by the remaining bandits further proves that Chiang Kai-shek knows his death is near, so he inflicted this vicious attack on the people of Shanghai. We must not only unanimously and resolutely support the People's Liberation Army to swiftly liberate Taiwan and capture Chiang Kai-shek alive to avenge the deceased compatriots, but also accuse U.S. imperialism of its crimes of aiding the bandits to the people of the world. He then said: Our most active and effective way is to purchase People's Victory Bonds as much as possible and use the purchase of public bonds to support the government and the People's Liberation Army to quickly eliminate the Chiang bandits. Gao Mingkai, director of the Department of Chinese Language and Literature, said: "This time, the airplanes manufactured by American imperialism bombed Shanghai and massacred the Chinese people, proving that American imperialism and its running dog, the Kuomintang remnants, will never willingly let the Chinese people live safely. Only by supporting the People's Liberation Army to swiftly liberate Taiwan, Hainan Island, and Tibet can the people of our country live in peace."

When the executive committee of the Peking University Student Union discussed this issue, it unanimously agreed: This is a desperate struggle by the Chiang Kai-shek gang colluding with Japanese pirates with the support of U.S. imperialism. In addition to expressing our deep condolences to the deceased people of Shanghai and their families, we should step up our support for the front lines, liberate Taiwan and the Zhoushan Islands as soon as possible, eliminate the remaining bandits' last air force base, and thoroughly wipe out the reactionaries to avenge the dead.

The preparatory committee of the Beijing Municipal Federation of Industry and Commerce believes that the Kuomintang reactionaries used American planes and bombs to massacre their compatriots, which is really hateful. Industrialists and businessmen across the country must contribute their strength to assist the government in solving difficulties, support the People's Liberation Army, and quickly strike Taiwan to settle this blood debt.

　　美帝帮助残匪疯狂轰炸上海
    京各界人民极表愤慨
    一致表示要加紧生产，加紧购买公债，支援人民解放军迅速解放台湾。
    【北京讯】京市各界对国民党残匪轰炸上海市民一致表示愤慨。市总工会副主席刘莱夫说：国民党匪帮屡次疯狂轰炸上海，这次上海居民又死伤千人以上，有全家都被炸死的惨事。这种灭绝人性的血腥暴行，是国民党匪帮在美帝国主义指使和帮助下的兽行和垂死挣扎的表现。我们除向死难同胞家属进行慰问外，并望上海同胞和我们北京工人一起，把愤恨变成力量，加紧生产，积极支援人民解放军，迅速打到台湾去，活捉蒋介石，为死难同胞复仇。
    燕京大学社会系教授严景耀说：这次残匪轰炸上海更加证明蒋匪自知死期已近，向上海人民下此毒手。我们不但要一致坚决支援人民解放军迅速解放台湾，活捉蒋介石为死难同胞复仇，更要向全世界人民控诉美帝援匪的罪行。接着他说：我们最积极的有效办法是尽量购买人民胜利折实公债，用购买公债来支援政府和人民解放军迅速消灭蒋匪。国文系主任高名凯说：“这一次美国帝国主义制造的飞机轰炸上海，屠杀中国人民，证明了美国帝国主义和他的走狗国民党残匪是永不甘心让中国人民得到安全的，我们全国人民只有支持人民解放军迅速解放台湾、海南岛和西藏，才能过安心日子。”
    北大学生会执委会讨论这一问题时，一致认为：这是蒋匪帮勾结日寇在美帝支援下的垂死挣扎，我们除对死难的上海人民及其家属致沉痛的哀悼外，更应该加紧支援前线，早日解放台湾和舟山群岛，消灭残匪最后的空军基地，彻底歼灭反动派，为死难者复仇。
    京市工商界联合会筹委会认为：国民党反动派用了美国的飞机和炸弹屠杀自己的同胞，实属令人痛恨，全国的工商业者，一定要拿出力量来协助政府解决困难，支援人民解放军，迅速打到台湾去，清算这笔血债。
