　　Xinhua News Agency Dispatch, Shenyang: The Industry Department of the Northeast People's Government issued a circular on the 23rd, rewarding factories and mines for outstanding new record creators and organizers in the movement to create new production records. In addition to receiving material rewards from their respective factories and mines, they were also approved by the Northeast People's Government to receive medals or banners from the Industry Department. A total of seventy-five individuals and seven collectives were awarded this time, including the casting workshop of the Benxi Coal and Iron Company Machinery Factory, the lead oil workshop of the Shenyang Paint Factory under the Chemical Industry Bureau, and the water usage team of the Shixian Paper Mill under the Enterprise Bureau. Among the individual award recipients, workers accounted for 77%, production management cadres accounted for slightly more than 13%, and technical personnel accounted for slightly more than 9%. Among the recipients of first-class medals was Li Ronglin, a worker at the Battery Factory under the Electric Appliance Industry Bureau. His successful experiment with the acid immersion method prevented the cracking of battery anode plates during the drying process due to shrinkage, reducing the scrap rate of finished products. It is estimated that this will save 2 billion yuan (Northeast currency) in costs in 1950. Another example is Shang Ke, director of the sand casting workshop of the Machinery Bureau Experimental Factory, who actively organized workers to increase the ratio of coke to molten iron from 1:5 (one ton of coke to five tons of iron) to 1:18.37, exceeding the highest record of 1:14 during the puppet Manchukuo regime.
　　While publishing the news of these seventy-five new record creators and organizers, the Northeast Daily also published a commentary entitled "Salute to Advanced Producers," stating that the emergence of advanced producers guaranteed the completion and exceeding of the 1949 production plan, and also prepared the conditions for further improving production efficiency and increased confidence in completing this year's production and construction tasks. The commentary called on all staff in factories and mines in the Northeast to learn from these advanced producers, promote their experience, and hoped that the award winners would continue to work hard, maintain their glory, unite all employees, and strive to implement economic accounting, improve product quality, reduce costs, and improve technology.

    【新华社电】沈阳讯：东北人民政府工业部于二十三日通报奖励各工厂、矿山在创造生产新纪录运动中出色的新纪录创造者和组织者。他们除受到各厂矿的物质奖励外，并经东北人民政府批准，由工业部发给奖章或奖旗。此次个人受奖者共七十五人，集体受奖者有本溪煤铁公司机械厂铸造场、化学工业管理局沈阳油漆厂铅油场、企业管理局石岘造纸厂用水班等七个单位。在个人受奖者中，工人占百分之七十七，生产管理干部占百分之十三强，技术人员占百分之九强。在一等奖章的获得者中，有电器工业管理局电池厂工人李荣林，他试验浸酸法获得成功，使电池阳极板在干燥过程中，避免了因收缩而发生的龟裂现象，削减了成品的废品率。据计算在一九五○年内，因此而节省的成本费将达二十亿元（东北币）。又如机械管理局实验工厂翻砂场主任尚可，积极组织工人，使熔铁用焦比例，从一比五（一吨焦化五吨铁汁）提高到一比十八点三七，超过伪满时最高一比十四的纪录。
    东北日报在刊登这七十五名新纪录创造者和组织者的消息同时，以“向先进生产者致敬”为题撰为评论说：先进生产者的涌现，保证了一九四九年生产计划的完成与超过，而且准备了进一步提高生产效率的条件，提高了完成今年生产建设任务的信心。评论号召东北各厂矿全体人员向这些先进生产者学习，推广其经验，并望受奖人员继续努力，保持光荣，团结全体职工，为贯彻经济核算制，提高产品质量，降低成本，提高技术而奋斗。
