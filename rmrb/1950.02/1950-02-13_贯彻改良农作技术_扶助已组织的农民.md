　　Implement Improved Farming Techniques, Support Organized Farmers

　　In the process of issuing agricultural loans, many shortcomings have also arisen in various regions. The main problem is the failure to implement the policy of improving farming techniques and supporting organized farmers, failure to pay attention to closely integrating with local actual conditions and actual needs, and particularly the failure to actively cooperate in promoting new farm tools and improved varieties, as well as advocating the careful selection of seeds. In some places, due to failure to properly grasp the season, loans were issued too early or too late, so that the difficulties of farmers could not be resolved in a timely manner, reducing the role of agricultural loans in production. In addition, some individual regions mechanically emphasized production conditions and repayment ability, so that some truly impoverished poor and hired peasants could not obtain loans or only received very little.

　　In order to better support this year's agricultural production, the Northeast Bank planned and deployed the work of recovering agricultural loans as early as after the autumn harvest last year. Farmers in various places who benefited from agricultural loans enthusiastically repaid them. According to the bank's statistics, by the end of last year, about 80 percent or more of the total loans issued throughout the Northeast, excluding the Shenyang area, had been recovered. Recently, the Northeast Bank convened an agricultural loan conference, which determined that this year's agricultural loan policy should be "develop production, fix usage, concentrate usage, and focus issuance." It stipulated that loans should focus on lending to organized farmers, promoting improved seeds, distributing new farm tools, improving agricultural production technology, and increasing grain production. In addition, it will also issue loans for livestock, fertilizers, farm tools, seeds, and a small portion of small-scale water conservancy, warm-bed seedling cultivation, and other items. In order to strengthen the leadership of the agricultural loan issuance work, the conference also decided to organize agricultural production loan committees at all levels, including relevant government departments, to achieve responsibility at each level and unified command. In terms of agricultural loan issuance methods, not only will the methods of lending in kind, converting to cash, fixed periods, and low interest rates be adopted, but it was also decided to further integrate with cooperatives.

　　贯彻改良农作技术  扶助已组织的农民
    在发放农贷的过程中，各地也产生了不少缺点，主要是没有贯彻改良农作技术与扶助已组织起来的农民的方针，没有注意密切结合当地的实际情况与实际需要，特别是没有积极配合推广新农具与优良品种以及提倡种籽的精选等。还有若干地方因未能很好地掌握季节，过早或过迟发放，以致不能适时地解决农民的困难，减低了农贷在生产上所起的作用。此外，也有个别地区机械地强调生产条件和偿还能力，使若干真正困难的贫雇农得不到或只得到很少的贷款。
    东北银行为了更好地扶助今年的农业生产，早在去年秋收结束后，即有计划地布置收回农贷的工作。各地受到农贷实惠的农民，都踊跃归还。据该行统计，截至去年年底止全东北除沈阳地区外，已收回贷款约占发放总额的百分之八十以上。日前东北银行召开了农贷会议，确定以“发展生产、固定用途、集中使用、重点发放”为今年的农贷方针，规定贷款以贷给组织起来的农民、推广优良种籽、发放新式农具、提高农业生产技术和增加粮食产量为重点，此外并将发放牲畜、肥料、农具、种籽和一小部分小型水利，温床育苗等贷款。为了加强发放农贷工作的领导，会议并决定组织包括政府各有关部门在内的各级农业生产贷款委员会，做到按级负责，统一指挥。在农贷发放方法上，不仅采取贷实、折现、定期、低利的方法，而且还决定进一步与合作社结合。
