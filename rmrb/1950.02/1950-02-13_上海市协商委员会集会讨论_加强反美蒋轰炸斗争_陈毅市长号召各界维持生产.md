Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 12th: The Shanghai Municipal Second People's Representative Conference Consultative Committee held its third meeting on the 11th to discuss the anti-US imperialism and remnant bandit bombing atrocities, as well as air defense, evacuation, and relief issues. Forty-four committee members attended, chaired by Mayor Chen Yi. At the meeting, Deputy Mayor Pan Hannian reported on the US-made aircraft's indiscriminate bombing of the city's power equipment on the 6th and the current emergency measures taken by the municipal authorities. Deputy Mayor Pan stated: The bombing on the 6th caused great losses to the lives and property of citizens. Because the bandit aircraft's targets were concentrated on the city's water and electricity equipment, the Shanghai Electric Power Company and others were severely damaged, causing most industries to come to a standstill, directly affecting the lives of citizens throughout the city. In addition to strengthening fire protection, rescue, and public security work, the government has also organized an Air Defense and Public Security Committee to uniformly lead relevant air defense and public security work, and is actively studying remedies for industrial power. Deputy Mayor Pan pointed out: Currently, some people still have a paralyzing mentality regarding the bandit aircraft bombing, and various publicity efforts should be launched to explain it from all aspects. Leng Yu, Jiang Yong, Han Xuezhang, Wang Genzhong, Liu Jingji, Wu Youxun, Bao Dasan, Liu Hongsheng, Li Zhaohuan, Wu Yun Chu, Rong Yiren, Kui Yanfang, Zhao Zukang, Xiang Shuxiang and other committee members spoke successively, raising many opinions on future air defense, propaganda, evacuation, water sources, electricity, transportation, protection of production equipment, factory relocation, and disaster relief, for the municipal authorities to refer to. Finally, Mayor Chen Yi said in his speech: We must recognize that the bandit aircraft's bombing of Shanghai this time is a desperate struggle by US imperialism and its running dog Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, especially the bombing of the American-owned power company, which proves even more the extreme ferocity of the US imperialists and their running dogs. But the bombing can only make us more calm and more united. We must make greater preparations and strengthen the work of the Air Defense and Public Security Committee; at the same time, we ask the Labor Bureau, the Industry and Commerce Bureau, the General Trade Union, and the Federation of Industry and Commerce to work together to study how to maintain production. We invite people from all walks of life to participate in the relief committee organization to assist in evacuation work, and we must also strive to purchase Real Value Public Bonds to express the common hatred of the people of Shanghai.

　　上海市协商委员会集会讨论
    加强反美蒋轰炸斗争   
    陈毅市长号召各界维持生产
    【新华社上海十二日电】上海市第二届人民代表会议协商委员会于十一日举行第三次会议，讨论反美帝国主义与残匪轰炸暴行及防空、疏散、救济等问题。到会委员四十四人，由陈毅市长主席。会上，潘汉年副市长报告六日美制飞机滥炸本市电力设备经过及目前市政当局紧急措施情况。潘副市长称：六日的轰炸，使市民的生命财产遭受极大损失。因为匪机的目标集中于本市各水电设备，以致上海电力公司等均遭严重破坏，使大部分工业陷入停顿状态，直接影响全市市民的生活。政府现除加强消防、救护、治安等工作外，并已组织了防空治安委员会，统一领导有关防空治安工作，同时积极研讨工业动力的补救办法。潘副市长指出：目前一部分人对于匪机轰炸尚有麻痹观念，应该展开各种宣传工作，从各方面加以说明。冷遹、江庸、韩学章、王艮仲、刘靖基、吴有训、包达三、刘鸿生、黎照寰、吴蕴初、荣毅仁、蒉延芳、赵祖康、项叔翔等委员都相继发言，对于今后防空、宣传、疏散、水源、电力、交通、保护生产设备、工厂内迁、救济灾民等问题，提出不少意见，供市政当局参考。最后陈毅市长讲话说：我们要认清匪机此次轰炸上海是美国帝国主义及其走狗蒋匪帮的绝望的挣扎，特别是不惜轰炸美商电力公司，更可证明美帝及其走狗的穷凶极恶。但轰炸只能使我们更冷静、更团结，我们要作更大的准备，加强防空治安委员会工作；同时并请劳动局、工商局、总工会、工商联合会等一起研究如何维持生产问题。我们请各界人士参加救济委员会机构，协助进行疏散工作，更要努力购买折实公债，以表示我上海人民的同仇敌忾。
