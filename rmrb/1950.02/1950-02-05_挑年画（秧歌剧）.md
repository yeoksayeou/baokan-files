　　Han: Hey! (Singing) I'm heading home from the New Year market, feeling happy all the way! Just now, the cadres at the market explained carefully: This year's New Year is unusual – it's the first New Year of New China, and everyone should celebrate enthusiastically; this year's production is doing well, I harvested more than ten shi (unit of dry measure) of grain, the whole family is happy, celebrating the New Year joyfully. Mumbling and mumbling, I'm here so quickly, without realizing I've arrived at my own door (Speaks) Er Hai! Er Hai! (Er Hai runs up)
　　Hai: Ah! Grandpa is back from the market! (Zhuzi, Zhuzi's wife, and Yinhua run up happily)
　　Zhu
　　Xi: Dad is back from the market?! ... You must be tired from walking so far, right?
　　Hua
　　Han: Not tired! I feel so happy in my heart that I don't feel tired! (Old Man sits)
　　Zhu: Dad! Was the New Year market in the city lively?
　　Han: Very lively! So many people, you can't move! (Stands up and counts with clapper) This year's New Year market is really lively, filling up four or five streets. On South Street, fresh pork is just being cut, and there's a lot of mutton too; on North Street, there are general merchandise stores selling spices, soy sauce, vinegar, star anise, peppercorns; on East Street, there's a flower market, with all kinds of fresh flowers for you to choose from...
　　Xi, Hua: Dad! What flowers did you pick for us?
　　Han: Look! (Takes out flowers) One for each of you! (Xi and Hua wear the flowers, Old Man counts with clapper) On West Street, they sell firecrackers, big "Ertian Jiao" firecrackers! (Note: large firecrackers)
　　Hai: Grandpa! Did you buy some for me?
　　Han: Bought them! Bought them! (Takes out firecrackers and hands them to the child, then counts with clapper) On West Street, they sell felt hats, good quality and good-looking!
　　Zhu: Did you buy one for me?
　　Han: Bought it! Bought it! (Takes out hat and gives it to Zhu, Zhu wears the hat, Old Man counts with clapper) The crossroads are even more lively, with five large halls connected into one, with all kinds of photographs displayed well. Comrades tell you in detail...
　　All: What do they show?
　　Han: (Clapper) There are tractors, and large铡刀 (铡刀 is a type of guillotine for cutting grass or straw); there's good grain growing good seedlings, that can withstand drought and are not afraid of floods. And – and there's the People's Liberation Army crossing the Yangtze River, with a fifty-year-old wife steering the boat. The Liberation Army lands like tigers descending the mountain, and not a single stubborn enemy can escape, and there's...
　　All: And what else?
　　Han: And...
　　All: And what else?
　　Han: (Unable to answer and a little anxious) And what else? And what else? Look at you, chasing me so closely! How could I remember everything from the market! Anyway, it's lively, so lively that you can't even remember it all!
　　Xi: Dad! We also wanted to ask you, did you do what we asked you to do?
　　Han: What request?
　　All: Did you buy New Year pictures for us?!
　　Han: Ah! Ah! I've been talking for so long and haven't said anything about that – the pictures have been bought, but I don't know if they're what you wanted? Tell me what you want to see who gets the best one!
　　All: Right! Let's all say what kind of picture we want and see who gets the best one!
　　Hai: Grandpa! I want to go first!
　　All: You go first!
　　Hai: I want… (Singing) I want a whole New Year picture, with a villain, old Chiang Kai-shek, on it. The villain, old Chiang Kai-shek, is wholeheartedly selling out the country to fight a civil war, recognizing his American daddy and acting shamelessly. Thanks to the Communist Party and the Liberation Army, who love and protect the motherland and the people, they crossed the Yellow River and the Yangtze River, determined to capture the villain, old Chiang Kai-shek, alive. The Chiang villain will not be able to escape even with wings, and the villainous Americans, even if driven away, will not be able to return. Hey hai yi ya hey, capture Chiang Kai-shek alive and overthrow the villainous Americans!
　　All: The picture you want will be difficult for the painter! Let's pick another one!
　　Hai: No! I must have this one!
　　Han: Okay, I'll give you this one. (Takes out the "Children Playing" picture and gives it to Hai) See if it's right?
　　All: (Looking at the picture) Ah! It's this picture!
　　Hai: Right! Grandpa, this is the one I wanted, let my grandma go see it. (Runs off)
　　Han: Hahaha, who wants to go next?
　　Hua: I want to go!
　　Zhu, Xi: You go ahead!
　　Hua: I want… (Singing) I want a whole New Year picture, with an old man standing in the middle. The old man is wearing a blue coat and pants, holding a three-year-old child in his hands. The child is red and plump, and the whole family pays attention to hygiene. People who pay attention to hygiene work diligently, living a long and prosperous life! Hey hai yi ya hey! Living a long and prosperous life!
　　Han: Good! You go next!
　　Xi: I want… (Singing) I want a whole New Year picture, with cotton blooming in the sunshine. The cotton blooms as white as snow, with each flower turning over and floating like clouds. A girl is floating on the clouds, picking flowers and putting them in a basket. People come to pick the flowers and they keep blooming, the young people are buried in the flowers. Hey hai yi ya hey! The young people are buried in the flowers.
　　Zhu: What kind of pictures do you want?
　　Hua: I want a picture of the whole family working diligently, living a long and prosperous life.
　　Xi: I want a picture to get rich by planting more flowers.
　　Han: Good! I'll get them for you to see! (Takes out the "Prosperous Year and Long Life Picture" and "Picking Cotton Picture" and unfolds them)
　　Xi
　　Hua: (Looking) You really guessed what we wanted!
　　Zhu: Dad is really good at figuring things out! (Everyone laughs)
　　Han: What picture do you want?
　　Xi
　　Hua: Only you are left!
　　Zhu: I want… (Singing) The picture I want is especially bright, with a mutual aid team busily engaged in production. The leader is in the front (Speaks) The leader uses a big hoe, three hoe strikes per seedling, three seedlings per step (Singing) Followed closely by five team members (Speaks) The team members are also lined up in a row, not falling behind! (Singing) Chatting and laughing while competing, hoeing four mu (unit of land measure) of land in half a day. Mutual aid production aside, learning culture also comes first. The leader attends the villagers' school (Speaks) The leader attends the people's school, learning three characters in one night (Singing) The team members also participate in literacy classes (Speaks) The team members are not lagging behind, learning one and a half characters in one night (Singing) If you ask who this group is, they are a group of Young Pioneers, hey hai yi ya hey! The Young Pioneers are really models.
　　Han: What you want is…
　　Hua
　　Xi: What he wants is for the Young Pioneers to excel in production, learning, and work.
　　Han: Good! Excel in production and learning. (Unfolds the "Mutual Aid Team Production and Learning" picture)
　　Zhu: This is the picture I want!
　　Hua
　　Xi: You've guessed what we wanted!
　　Han: It's not that I've guessed what you wanted, it's that we're of one mind. (Everyone laughs) Hey! Now it's time to look at my picture (Unfolds the "Family Democracy" picture) Look! (Singing) Spring arrives on the sixth day of the ninth nine-day period.
　　All (Singing): The whole family comes to have a meeting.
　　Han (Singing): The fifty-year-old man is the chairman.
　　Hua (Singing): The eighteen-year-old daughter takes notes.
　　Zhu (Singing): Plans for the year's production are made.
　　Xi
　　Hua (Singing): Home,
　　Han
　　Zhu (Singing): Field,
　　(Chorus) All taken care of.
　　Han
　　Zhu (Singing): Women,
　　Xi
　　Hua (Singing): Men,
　　(Chorus) All speak out.
　　All (Singing): The family is harmonious and truly democratic,
　　Han
　　Hua (Singing): A democratic family is of one mind,
　　Zhu
　　Xi (Singing): Turning a handful of yellow earth into gold,
　　All (Singing): Hey hai yi ya hey, when people are of one mind, earth turns into gold.
　　(Hai runs up)
　　Hai: Grandma is here, grandma is here. (Po runs up happily)
　　Po: You all have pictures, where is mine?
　　Han: I didn't buy one for you, let's share one!
　　Zhu
　　Xi: Mom! Just share one with Dad!
　　Hua
　　Po: Why should I share one with him? I have one of my own!
　　All: What kind of picture is it?
　　Po: Guess!
　　Xi: I guess you're looking at your daughter's picture!
　　Po: Wrong! Daughters and daughters-in-law are the same.
　　Hua: I guess you're holding a grandson's picture?
　　Po: Wrong! Children and nephews are the same! (Hugs Hai)
　　Zhu: Mom! I guess you're holding a mahjong picture!
　　Po: Nonsense! Everyone is producing, why would I want money?
　　Han: Ah! I must have guessed it, you must have the "Heavenly Official Bestows Blessings" picture!
　　Po: You old fool, I'm not an old feudalist!
　　Xi: We can't guess, Mom! Just tell us!
　　Po: Okay! Listen to me: (Singing) The picture I want is really hard to guess, the things in it are cleverly arranged, one leading a group walking, one crowing to open ten thousand households, every household can't do without him, small investment for great profits to get rich. If you want to know the reason, let me unfold the picture. (Unfolds the "Raising Pigs and Chickens for Great Profit" picture with both hands)
　　All: Ah! It turns out to be a litter of piglets! (Laughter)
　　Hai: A whole eighteen piglets!
　　Xi: Mom! Who gave you this picture?
　　Po: Auntie Er from the east neighborhood!
　　Hua: Mom! I don't agree with you having so many pigs, how can we carry out sanitation work?!
　　Zhu: You're really selfish! Raising pigs and chickens is a small investment for great profit, eating meat and eggs, getting spending money, and the leftovers won't go to waste, and you can also accumulate more fertilizer to grow more grain. As long as we are diligent, we can still do a good job with sanitation work!
　　Xi
　　Han: Right! Seeking cleanliness in dirt is what counts as sanitation!
　　Hai: Grandpa! Everyone has a picture, whose is the best?
　　All: Mine is the best! Mine is the best! Mine is the best! …
　　Han: Don't shout, everyone! In my opinion, everyone's is good. Tell me: Can our farmers do without production, sanitation, planting cotton, or raising pigs and chickens? Tell me: Can we do without family democracy? The government also holds representative meetings to solicit everyone's opinions! Without family democracy, can we unite for production? Tell me: Isn't overthrowing Chiang Kai-shek and establishing a New China even more important? In my opinion, everyone's is good! Hahaha…
　　All: Right! Everyone's is good!
　　Han: But do you know how this "good" came about? Where did it come from? It came from here. (Takes out Mao Zedong's portrait and displays it with both hands, everyone is pleasantly surprised) This "good" all came from the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Communist Party! (Singing) Everyone's affairs are all good.
　　All (Singing): This is all thanks to the good leadership of Chairman Mao and the Communist Party.
　　Han (Singing): Chairman Mao is generous and wise,
　　All (Singing): Leading us to build a new country.
　　Han (Singing): New China, new families,
　　All (Singing): New families live in a new era, hey hai yi ya hey, the new era is rising day by day.
　　Han: Everyone understands now, right?
　　All: Understood!
　　Hai: Grandpa! Give me the portrait of Chairman Mao?
　　All: You can't! This is a portrait of the leader, you can't have it.
　　Hai: (Wants to grab it) I must have it!
　　Han: Good child! Let's hang the portrait of the leader in the main hall!
　　All: Right! Let's hang the portrait of Chairman Mao in the main hall! (Everyone crowds off)
