　　We Learned the Most Vivid Lesson in Internationalism
    Broadcast by Xiao Hua, Head of the Chinese Democratic Youth Delegation, on Central People's Radio about Attending the International Youth and Student Festival and Visiting the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe

    [Our Newspaper News] Xiao Hua, head of the Chinese Democratic Youth Delegation, broadcast to the nation on Central People's Broadcasting Station last night. The full text of the broadcast is as follows: Dear comrades and friends:
    The Chinese Democratic Youth Delegation, entrusted by the Chinese New Democratic Youth League, the All-China Federation of Democratic Youth, and the All-China Students' Federation, attended the International Youth and Student Festival held in Budapest, the capital of Hungary, from August 14th to 28th last year, and the Second World Democratic Youth Representative Assembly from September 2nd to 8th. After the successful conclusion of the meetings, the majority of the delegation members returned to the country one after another. Upon the invitation of youth organizations from various countries, and the instructions of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League and the All-China Federation of Democratic Youth, we organized a visiting group to visit the new democratic countries of Eastern Europe (Hungary, Albania, Bulgaria, Romania, Czechoslovakia, Poland, etc.) and the socialist Soviet Union. The purpose was to learn from the experiences of youth movements in various countries, especially the experience of the Soviet Communist Youth League, to learn from their experiences in post-war recovery and construction, to strengthen ties with youth organizations in various countries, and to introduce the situation of the Chinese youth struggle. After nearly half a year, we have now returned victoriously to the capital of the motherland. Now, I would like to give you a brief report on some of our impressions abroad.
  A Magnificent Review of the World's Democratic Youth Strength
    This International Youth and Student Festival was a grand event of great historical significance in the history of the world youth movement. Young people from all over the world sent their delegations, gathering in Budapest from Europe, Asia, the Americas, Oceania, and Africa. A total of 10,371 young men and women representing 83 countries participated in the International Youth Festival, plus nearly 250,000 Hungarian youths who took turns pouring into Budapest from cities and villages across the country, fully demonstrating the magnificent strength of the world's democratic youth.
    The Second World Democratic Youth Representative Assembly was attended by a total of 776 representatives, representing 69 countries and more than 60 million organized members, doubling the membership compared to the first representative assembly held in London in November 1945. This proves that since 1945, the democratic youth movement in various countries has developed more extensively. The spirit of tension, unity, and friendship ran through the conference from beginning to end. In heated discussions, the report on the four-year activities and future tasks of the World Federation of Democratic Youth was unanimously endorsed. The speeches of the Soviet and Chinese delegations at the conference received stormy applause and cheers from the audience. The conference unanimously condemned and resolutely opposed the conspiracy of imperialist warmongers to provoke new wars and divide the solidarity of the world's democratic youth. The Soviet Union's peace policy was unanimously supported and endorsed by the audience. The fighting youth of China, Greece, Spain, and Vietnam were unanimously commended by the conference. The youth of all countries have a strong confidence in safeguarding the world's peace and democratic cause. As the resolution of the conference stated: "In the face of the threat of a new war, the forces of peace and democracy are growing stronger." The great victory of the Chinese revolution is also a great victory for the world's peace and democratic forces against the imperialist bloc. The democratic youth of the world unanimously swore to fight to the end with their unyielding struggle and action for the lasting peace of the world, people's democracy, national independence, and a better future for youth.
    Soviet Youth are a Good Example for the Youth of New China
    Soviet youth play a leading role in the entire ranks of international youth. They not only demonstrated unparalleled revolutionary heroism in the Second World Anti-Fascist War, but also played their vanguard role in the post-war new Five-Year Plan and socialist construction. They are fighting for the early completion of the Five-Year Plan with selfless and glorious labor. In the first year of the plan, 650,000 young people completed it ahead of schedule, 1.25 million young people completed it ahead of schedule in the second year, and 1.5 million young people completed it ahead of schedule in the third year. In three years, another 450,000 young people completed the entire Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule. Now, many labor heroes are doing the work of 1957. In the work of restoring destroyed cities, youth have also played a significant role. More than 30,000 young people participated in the restoration of Stalingrad, 26,000 young people participated in the restoration of the Dnieper Hydroelectric Power Plant, and 500,000 young people participated in the restoration of the Donbass. In the restoration of the fifteen oldest cities, young people helped with work in their spare time for as much as 25 million hours. Every young worker is skilled and proficient in their own technology, and there are new inventions every day. In 1947, an average of one new invention was made for every seven workers, and great achievements were made in saving raw materials, eliminating waste products, and utilizing waste.
    In terms of agricultural production, countless young people have become excellent tractor drivers, actively participating in the work of tractor stations and electrical stations. They are fighting to increase the yield per hectare. In 1947 and 1948, 800 young people became agricultural labor heroes, and 8,000 young people received medals. In terms of developing animal husbandry, the Soviet Communist Youth League mobilized 300,000 young people to work on pastures.
    In implementing the Michurin Plan, Soviet youth organized more than 23,000 afforestation teams, with 5 million students participating in the Michurin movement alone. Ukrainian students planted 6.5 million trees last year. Soviet youth enjoy the most fulfilling cultural life. Children over the age of seven generally receive seven years of compulsory education. There are 776 higher education institutions in the Soviet Union, with more than one million university students. There are 200,000 general schools with 34 million students, conducting education in 112 ethnic languages, respecting and promoting the excellent cultural traditions of various ethnic groups. In addition, there are 770,000 young workers studying in technical schools and 1.3 million young workers studying in night schools. There are 110,000 cultural palaces and clubs, 60,000 libraries, and more than 80,000 theaters across the country, all of which are available for young people to enjoy. Sports have become a daily mass movement, and trade unions spend millions of rubles on sports equipment every year.
    Soviet youth not only strictly observe the eight-hour work system, consciously abide by labor discipline in their work, but also enjoy the right to rest. Last year, 2 million young workers went to the best sanatoriums for recuperation, and 5 million children traveled to various places. The Soviet Union's care for children is even more meticulous. There are currently 14 million Young Pioneers in the Soviet Union. They help schools educate children in the spirit of communism. Children's Palaces, Children's Technical Stations, Children's Parks, Children's Stadiums, Swimming Pools, Children's Theaters, Children's Cinemas, and Reading Rooms are set up everywhere. The Children's Truth newspaper sells 12 million copies per issue.
    Soviet youth are the happiest youth in the world, they are thoughtful youth who have received profound education, they are brave and highly creative youth. They are an example for the youth of New China. Their path is the path that the youth of New China must take.
    Great Achievements of Youth in Eastern European New Democratic Countries
    The youth of the new democratic countries in Eastern Europe have achieved great results in restoring and building their motherlands in the short few years since liberation. The industrial and agricultural production of each country has reached and exceeded pre-war levels. We have personally seen construction everywhere, building new factories, new workers' residences, new railways, power stations, new schools, clubs, stadiums, libraries, etc. They voluntarily organize national construction teams, with each person helping the country with one to two months of compulsory labor per year. In Bulgaria alone, there are 7,900 labor construction teams, and 2,000 construction teams are entirely composed of young people. There are 250,000 shock workers in various factories. Romanian youth construction teams are participating in the great construction project of the new Danube Canal. The Czech youth construction team built the 21-kilometer-long Czech-Soviet Friendship Railway. Poland has a construction team of more than 100,000 people participating in the reconstruction of Warsaw. In rural areas, cooperatives have been widely developed, and new labor techniques have been learned and mastered. In the Czech Republic alone, there were 30,000 tractors and more than 300 tractor stations last year. Hungary had 3,000 tractors last year. The lives of youth in various countries have achieved abundance, and the cultural and material welfare of youth has been continuously improved along with the development of production. The educational reserve fund of Albania alone has increased by 923% compared to before the war. Last year, more than 1,000 workers in the Czech Republic entered universities to study, and more than 500,000 workers in Poland entered technical schools to study. The youth of various countries are vigorously building their own countries, and starting from 1950, they will begin to implement new five-year socialist construction plans. With the help of the Soviet Union, they are building a more fulfilling socialist life with selfless labor and full confidence.
    The Victory of the Chinese Revolution Inspired the People of the World
    The great victory of the Chinese revolution greatly inspired the people and youth of the world. The fighting Chinese youth enjoy great glory in the ranks of the world's democratic youth. Youth in Italy and other countries used meeting with the fighting Chinese youth in Budapest as a call to mobilize their own youth. Whenever the Chinese delegation arrived at a place or venue, countless men, women, old and young waved, cheered, embraced us, offered flowers, asked the Chinese delegation to sign autographs, and asked us for Mao Zedong badges, smiling and giving a thumbs up, shouting Mao Zedong! The names of Stalin and Mao Zedong have become the common language of the people and youth all over the world. Many institutions, schools, and factories hang maps of the victorious march of the Chinese People's Liberation Army and photos of Comrade Stalin and Mao Zedong. Newspapers in various countries often publish news of China's victory and Chairman Mao's works on the front page. In many countries, enthusiastic study and discussions have been conducted. The Greek Democratic Army regarded Chairman Mao's strategic issues of the Chinese revolution as the most important learning documents. Sixty construction teams in Bulgaria are proudly called the "Mao Zedong Construction Team." The founding of the People's Republic of China was regarded as a carnival festival by various countries. The five-star national flag of China was quickly raised everywhere. The delegation's residence was often visited by countless people and youth who came to cheer and applaud. An Albanian guerrilla hero, nearly seventy years old, embraced the Chinese representative and cried with excitement, saying: "Albania has never seen Chinese people before. Now that New China has won, we have met them. Although our country has only 1.2 million people, adding New China, we have 476.2 million people." Many young people in various countries are enthusiastically learning Chinese, and countless men, women, old and young are asking us about the health of Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu. The great meeting between Chairman Mao and Comrade Stalin has further excited the people of the world. The respect and honor that Chinese youth have received from the people and youth of various countries cannot be fully described in a short speech. All this glory belongs to our wise and great leader of the people, Chairman Mao, to all the people of China, and to the heroic Chinese People's Liberation Army.
    This visit has given each delegate comrade the most vivid lesson in internationalism, further strengthening our confidence and strength in the construction of the motherland. Our China is a country with 5,000 years of history and culture, infinite resources, and a large population. Coupled with the friendship and assistance of our great international friends, the socialist Soviet Union and the new democratic countries, and the leadership of our great people's leader, Chairman Mao, we have the confidence and strength to build a new, strong, prosperous, and industrialized New China, preparing to embark on a glorious and splendid socialist future! Let us hold high the glorious fighting banner of Mao Zedong, unite closely with the democratic youth of the world, and fight to defend our country's independence, to defend the world's lasting peace and democracy, and to strive for a happier future for youth!

　　我们上了国际主义最生动的一课
    中国民主青年代表团团长萧华在中央人民电台播讲出席国际青年学生节及参观苏联东欧经过
    【本报讯】中国民主青年代表团团长萧华，昨晚在中央人民广播电台向全国广播，广播词全文如下：亲爱的同志们朋友们：
    中国民主青年代表团受中国新民主主义青年团、中华全国民主青年联合总会、全国学联的委托，出席去年八月十四日至二十八日在匈牙利首都布达佩斯召开的国际青年节学生节及九月二日至八日世界民主青年第二次代表大会，在会议胜利结束后，代表团绝大部分人员即先后返国。我们蒙各国青年团体之邀请，及中国新民主主义青年团、中华全国民主青年联合总会的指示，组织了参观团，赴东欧各新民主主义国家（匈、阿、保、罗、捷、波等国）及社会主义的苏联参观，目的是学习各国青年运动的经验，特别是苏联共产主义青年团的经验。学习他们战后恢复和建设工作的经验，加强与各国青年团体的联系，介绍中国青年斗争的情况，前后历时半载，现在已胜利的回到祖国的首都了。现谨将我们在国外所看到的一些印象，向你们作一简单的报告。
  世界民主青年的雄伟力量的检阅
    这次的国际青年节学生节是在世界青年运动史上具有伟大历史意义的一个盛会，全世界的青年都派出了自己的代表团，由欧洲、亚洲、美洲、海洋洲、非洲聚集到布达佩斯，参加国际青年节的总共有八十三个国家的代表，一万零三百七十一位男女青年，加上将近二十五万的匈牙利青年，轮流由全国各城市乡村涌入布达佩斯巡礼，充分表现了世界民主青年力量的雄伟。
    第二次世界民主青年代表大会到会的代表总共有七百七十六人，代表六十九个国家，六千多万有组织的会员，比第一次一九四五年十一月在伦敦召开的代表大会增加了一倍的会员，这就证明从一九四五年以来，各国民主青年运动已有了更加广泛的发展。会议自始至终都贯彻着紧张、团结、友谊的精神。在热烈的讨论中，一致的拥护世界民主青年联合会四年活动和今后任务的报告，苏联代表团与中国代表团在大会的讲话，受到了全场狂风暴雨般的鼓掌和欢呼。大会对于帝国主义战争贩子挑拨新战争与分裂世界民主青年团结的阴谋，受到一致的斥责与坚决的反对。苏联的和平政策，受到了全场一致的拥护和赞助，中国、希腊、西班牙、越南的战斗青年受到大会一致的表扬，各国青年对于保卫世界和平民主事业都具有坚强的信心，正如大会的决议所说的：“在新战争威胁的面前，和平民主的力量生长得更加强大。”中国革命的伟大胜利，也就是全世界和平民主力量对帝国主义集团共同的伟大胜利。全世界民主青年一致地宣誓：要以自己的不屈不挠的斗争和行动为争取世界的持久和平、人民民主，各民族独立和青年更美满的前途而斗争到底。
    苏联青年是新中国青年的好榜样
    苏联青年在整个国际青年的行列中，起着领导的作用，他们不仅在第二次反法西斯的世界大战中，表现了无比的革命英雄主义，而且在战后新的五年计划、社会主义建设中，同样发挥了他们的先锋作用。他们以忘我的光荣的劳动，为提前完成五年计划而斗争。计划的第一年，就有六十五万青年提早完成，第二年有一百二十五万青年提早完成，第三年有一百五十万青年提前完成。三年中，又有四十五万青年提前完成了整个的五年计划。现在有不少的劳动英雄正在做着一九五七年的工作，在恢复被破坏城市的建设工作中，青年也起了很大作用。三万以上的青年，参加斯大林格勒的恢复工作，二万六千青年参加德聂伯水电厂的恢复工作，五十万青年参加顿巴斯的恢复工作，在恢复十五个最古老的城市中，青年在业余帮助做工的就达二千五百万小时。每个青年工人，都熟练和精通自己的技术，每天都有新的发明，一九四七年，平均在七个工人就有一件新的发明，在节约原料，消灭废品，以及利用废物中都有很大的成绩。
    在农业生产方面，无数的青年成为了优秀的拖拉机手，积极参加拖拉机站、电气站的工作。他们要为提高每海克脱的生产量而斗争。在一九四七和四八年中，就有八百个青年当了农业劳动英雄。八千青年得了奖章。在发展牧畜业方面，苏联共产主义青年团动员了三十万青年到牧场去工作。
    在实现米丘林计划上，苏联青年就组织了两万三千个以上的植林队，仅学生就有五百万人参加米丘林运动。乌克兰学生去年就种了六百五十万棵树，苏联青年享有最美满的文化生活，七岁以上儿童普遍受七年制的义务教育。全苏高等学校就有七七六个，一百万以上的大学生，普通学校有二十万个，三千四百万学生，用一百十二种的民族文字进行教育，尊重和发扬各民族优良文化传统。除此，尚有七十七万的青年工人在技术学校学习，一百三十万青工在夜校学习。全国有十一万座文化宫、俱乐部，六万所图书馆，八万多个戏院，都是可以供给青年享用的，体育运动已成为日常的群众性的运动，职工会每年将几百万卢布用在体育设备上。
    苏联的青年不仅是严守八小时的工作制，在工作中自觉的遵守劳动纪律，而且每人都享有休养的权利。去年就有两百万青年工人到最好的疗养所休养，有五百万儿童到各地旅行。苏联对于儿童的爱护更是无微不至。现全苏的少年先锋队员有一千四百万人，他们帮助学校以共产主义精神教育儿童。各地都设有儿童宫、儿童技术站、儿童公园、儿童体育场、游泳池、儿童剧院、儿童电影院、阅读室，儿童真理报每期就销行一千二百万份。
    苏联青年是全世界最幸福的青年，是受过高深教养的有思想的青年，是勇敢而富有高度创造性的青年，他们是我们新中国青年的榜样，他们的道路就是我们新中国青年要走的道路。
    东欧新民主国家青年的伟大业绩
    东欧各新民主主义国家的青年，他们在解放后的短短的几年时间里，在恢复和建设他们的祖国方面，同样地获得了伟大的成绩。各个国家在工业和农业的生产方面，都已达到和超过战前的水准，我们亲眼看到到处都在大兴土木，都在建设新的工厂，新的工人住宅，新的铁路，电力站，新的学校，俱乐部，体育场，图书馆等，他们自愿的组织国家建设队，每人每年帮助国家义务劳动一个月至两个月，单保加利亚就有七九○○个劳动建设队。全部是青年参加的建设队有二千个。各个工厂的突击人员有二十五万人，罗马尼亚的青年建设队正在参加多瑙河新运河的伟大建设工程。捷克的青年建设队，建设了二十一公里长的捷苏友好铁路。波兰有十万人以上的建设队，正在参加重建华沙的工作。农村方面普遍的发展了合作社，和学习掌握新的劳动技术。单捷克去年就有三万架拖拉机，三百个以上的拖拉机站。匈牙利去年就有三千架拖拉机，各国青年的生活都已做到丰衣足食，青年的文化和物质的福利，也紧随着生产的开展而不断的提高。单阿尔巴尼亚国家的教育预备金就比战前增加了百分之九二三，捷克去年就有一千以上的工人进入大学学习，波兰有五十多万工人进入技术学校学习，各国的青年都在朝气勃勃建设自己的国家，从一九五○年起，都要开始实行新的五年社会主义建设计划，他们都以忘我的劳动，在苏联帮助之下满怀信心的建设着更美满的社会主义生活。
    中国革命的胜利鼓舞了世界人民
    中国革命的伟大胜利，大大地鼓舞了全世界的人民和青年。战斗的中国青年，在世界民主青年的行列中享有极大的光荣。意大利等国青年，以到达布达佩斯和战斗的中国青年见面为动员本国青年的号召，每当中国代表团到达一地或会场时，就有无数的男女老少向我们招手欢呼，拥抱，献花，要中国代表团签字，向我们要毛泽东纪念章，满面笑容的伸出大姆指高喊毛泽东！斯大林和毛泽东的名字成为全世界人民和青年的共同语言，许多机关学校和工厂，都挂着中国人民解放军胜利进军的地图，及斯大林和毛泽东同志的照片。各国的报纸，常常都以第一版登载中国胜利的消息，毛主席的论著；在许多国家都进行了热烈的学习和讨论。希腊民主军把毛主席著的中国革命的战略问题，当作最重要的学习文献，保加利亚有六十个建设队，光荣地称为“毛泽东建设队”。中华人民共和国的成立，各国都把这一天看成是狂欢的节日，中国的五星国旗很快的高扬在各地，代表团的住处，经常有无数的人民和青年来欢呼鼓掌。阿尔巴尼亚一位将近七十岁高龄的游击队英雄，拥抱着中国代表兴奋得流泪，他说：“阿尔巴尼亚从来没有看到过中国人，新中国胜利了，我们就见到了，我们国家虽然只有一百二十万人口，但是把新中国加进去，我们就有四万万七千六百二十万人口了。”各国有不少的青年都在热烈学习中文，无数的男女老少都询问我们关于毛主席朱总司令的健康。这次毛主席与斯大林同志伟大的晤面，更兴奋了全世界人民。中国青年所受到各国人民青年这样的尊敬与荣誉，不是短短的讲话所能说完的。这一切光荣是属于我们英明伟大的人民的领袖毛主席，属于全中国的人民，属于英勇的中国人民解放军。
    这次的参观，给我们每个代表同志上了国际主义最生动的一课，更加强了我们对祖国建设的信心和力量。我们中国是具有五千年的历史和文化，无穷的富源、人口众多的国家，再加上有伟大的国际友人社会主义苏联和各新民主主义国家的友谊援助，有我们伟大的人民的领袖毛主席的领导，我们是有信心有力量来建设起新的强盛的繁荣的工业化的新中国，准备将来走上光辉灿烂的社会主义前途！让我们高举毛泽东的光辉的战斗旗帜，同全世界民主青年紧紧地团结一起，为保卫我们祖国的独立，为保卫世界的持久和平、民主，为争取青年更幸福的前途而斗争！
