The Beijing Public Security Bureau Criminal Investigation Team Smashes Three Gangs of Major Bandits
    Fourteen Habitual Bandits Apprehended
    [Beijing News] The Beijing Public Security Bureau Criminal Investigation Brigade cracked down on three major bandit gangs on January 18th, capturing bandit leaders Wang Huimin, Zheng Zifeng, Zhang Jiexuan, and bandits Ma Ke, Yu Wanming, Wu Zhenkui, and others, totaling fourteen people. Six pistols, 306 bullets, and a large number of valuable stolen goods were seized. On the morning of November 16th of last year, a robbery occurred at No. 53 North Pool. When the bandits were surrounded and pursued by military police, they opened fire and resisted arrest, killing two police officers, Liu Hongnian and Xu Yunsheng, from the Sixth Precinct. After the incident, the Criminal Investigation Brigade conducted a thorough investigation and finally solved the case on January 18th. First, the bandit leader Wang Huimin and robbers Ma Ke and Yu Wanming, who robbed No. 53 North Pool, were captured. Two pistols used in the robbery, 63 bullets, and some of the stolen goods were seized on the spot. Based on clues, the brigade continued to capture the bandit leaders Zheng Zifeng and Zhang Jiexuan, and bandits Wu Zhenkui, Li Liangjing, Liu Zhennan, Bao Yukun, Liu Chenggui, Zhang Zhanyi, Ren Guoying, Liu Xicheng, and Zhang Hongzhi, who had colluded with Wang and others to commit crimes. Four pistols and 243 bullets were also seized. In the preliminary interrogation, bandit leader Wang Huimin confessed to his crime of robbing No. 53 North Pool. The criminal also confessed that his father, Wang Dejun, and his uncle, Wang Desheng, were both bandit leaders in eastern Beijing and had been executed before the liberation of Beijing. In addition to being a bandit, the criminal himself served as the head of the Ba County puppet police force during the Japanese puppet regime, consistently harming the people. In 1940, he was sentenced to death by the puppet court for kidnapping and murder. He was released by the puppet court on the eve of Beijing's liberation and continued to commit robberies. The two bandit leaders, Zheng and Zhang, had successively served as regimental commander and deputy commander of the Kuomintang bandit army, and had consistently opposed the revolutionary cause. Since the liberation of Beijing, the three bandit leaders, Wang, Zheng, and Liu, had colluded with secret agents, scattered soldiers, and habitual bandits, respectively, to organize three gangs of bandits, carrying out armed robbery and disrupting revolutionary order. They committed robberies and murders in fifteen places, including No. 39 Jiulianzi Hutong, No. 19 Jia, Dawailangying, No. 2 Biandan Hutong, No. 6 Xiaotudimiao, and No. 7 Shanxi Street, and No. 53 North Pool. After the crimes were committed, the criminals fled in all directions, but they were ultimately caught in the net of the people by the meticulous investigation and arrest of the Criminal Investigation Brigade.
