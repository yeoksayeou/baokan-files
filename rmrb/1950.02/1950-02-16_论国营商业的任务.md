　　On the Tasks of State-Owned Commerce
    Yang Bo
    Recently, some private industrialists and businessmen, as well as some working cadres, have raised some opinions regarding the work of state-owned trade today. For example, they say: "The government's policy towards industry is 'considering both public and private interests,' but towards commerce, it only considers public interests and not private interests," and so on. Due to their blurred understanding, they have developed many unnecessary doubts about the "considering both public and private interests" policy in the people's democratic government's current economic policy. Therefore, the nature and tasks of state-owned commerce in the new democratic economy are briefly discussed below.
    The economic policy in the Common Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference stipulates from the outset: "The fundamental policy of economic construction of the People's Republic of China is to achieve the goal of developing production and promoting economic prosperity through the policy of taking into consideration both public and private interests, benefiting both labor and capital, assisting both urban and rural areas, and promoting both domestic and foreign trade. The state shall, in terms of business scope, raw material supply, sales market, working conditions, technology and equipment, financial policy, and monetary policy, regulate the state-owned economy, the cooperative economy, the individual economy of farmers and handicraftsmen, private capitalism, and state capitalism, so that various social economic components can cooperate under the leadership of the state-owned economy, each fulfilling its role, to promote the development of the entire social economy." In the commercial field, it stipulates: "Protect all legal public and private trade. Implement control over foreign trade and adopt a protectionist trade policy. Implement freedom of domestic trade within the state's unified economic plan, but strictly prohibit speculative commerce that disrupts the market. State-owned trade organs shall be responsible for regulating supply and demand, stabilizing prices, and supporting the people's cooperative enterprises..." According to this general policy, in the new democratic economic construction, the tasks of our state-owned trade work are mainly:
    (1) To support the development of production. All activities of state-owned trade work must take the development of various production enterprises that are beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood as their primary purpose. In agriculture: Due to the seasonality of agricultural production, the ruling classes in history have fully utilized this characteristic to carry out cruel exploitation of farmers. On the one hand, they lowered the price to purchase agricultural products from farmers; on the other hand, they sold various daily necessities to farmers at high prices, extracting exorbitant profits from them. Today, our state-owned trade companies do exactly the opposite. On the one hand, it supplies farmers with various major means of production and living at low prices, such as farm tools, seeds, fertilizers, and cloth; on the other hand, it purchases various surplus products from farmers at prices conducive to farmers' reproduction, thereby helping agricultural production, promoting the exchange of materials between urban and rural areas, enabling farmers to gradually get rid of layers of intermediate exploitation, and increasing farmers' purchasing power. For example, after the new cotton was launched last year, the purchase price of cotton by state-owned trade companies in various places in North China was stipulated to be no less than eight to ten catties of millet per catty of cotton, and in Shandong, it was twelve catties of coarse grain per catty of cotton. In the Northwest region, when the new cotton was launched last year, because the state-owned trade companies did not purchase it in time, local private merchants tried their best to lower the market price and purchased it at a price of about six catties of millet per catty of cotton. After our trade company discovered this, in order to protect the interests of farmers, it implemented large-scale purchases, which maintained the price of more than eight catties of millet per catty of cotton. In the Northeast region, when state-owned trade companies were first established in 1946 and 1947, farmers could only exchange one and a half bolts of white fine cloth for one ton of coarse grain, but last year, with the help of trade companies, farmers could exchange more than three bolts of white fine cloth for one ton of coarse grain. The unreasonable scissors difference between industrial and agricultural products was overcome.
    In industry, it is to ensure the supply of raw materials and be responsible for promoting the sales of finished products. For example, after the liberation of Shanghai, due to the enemy's blockade, many private industrialists and businessmen felt the suffering of lack of raw materials and slow sales of finished products. However, this situation was quickly changed with the vigorous assistance of our state-owned trade companies. In the past six months, our trade company has supplied Shanghai with the main industrial raw materials and fuels, including more than 40 million catties of cotton, nearly one million tons of coal, and a large amount of wood, steel plates, oil, and other raw materials. Cotton and silk textiles, hardware equipment, and other daily necessities produced in Shanghai were also organized for sale to other regions in large quantities. In Beijing and Tianjin, in the past year, our state-owned trade companies have also supplied more than 600,000 dan of cotton, more than 400 million catties of various processed grains, and a large amount of oil, tobacco leaves, rubber materials, wood, sulfur, and other industrial raw materials. It also operates various major industrial and mining products: more than 3 million bolts of cloth, nearly 50,000 pieces of yarn, more than 1.5 million tons of coal, and more than 1,500 tons of egg products. In addition, many small factories and handicraft products in Beijing and Tianjin, because they do not have a fixed brand name, many private merchants are unwilling to sell them on their behalf. After the establishment of our department store, it purchased or sold them on consignment, solving the sales problem of these products. All these activities of state-owned trade companies in supplying raw materials and promoting the sales of finished products undoubtedly play a powerful role in promoting and guiding the development of the entire social production undertaking.
    (2) Regulate supply and demand, stabilize prices, and guarantee the people's livelihood. Although all market activities of private commerce have a certain role in regulating supply and demand; but its essence is to take profit as the sole purpose of its operation. The result of free competition in the pursuit of profit is often destroying the stability of the market and prices. Especially when the currency value is unstable, many private merchants are more accustomed to using illegal means such as hoarding and speculation to drive up prices and disrupt market order. Therefore, state-owned trade companies must control a large number of major materials, regulate the supply and demand of the market, and directly supply the daily necessities of the broad masses of working people through mass cooperatives and their own retail stores, in order to stabilize prices, stabilize people's livelihoods, and combat the speculative activities of private merchants. Only in this way can we strengthen the state-owned trade companies' power to control the market and maintain and consolidate the leading position of our state-owned economy in commerce. Whenever prices fluctuate, many private merchants hoard goods and refuse to sell them. Our state-owned trade companies sell off large quantities of goods at prices lower than the market price. In order to ensure the market supply of various major materials and eliminate the excessive exploitation of the broad masses of working people by private merchants, our state-owned trade companies should not only do wholesale business in the operation of various major materials (such as grain, cotton, yarn, cloth, oil, coal, salt, etc.), but also carry out retail work through cooperatives.
    (3) In terms of foreign trade, our state-owned trade company is carrying out its work according to the policy of "encouraging exports and restricting imports". In terms of exports, all export materials that are sufficient to influence the international market (such as bristles) and various strategic materials (such as tungsten, antimony, tin, etc.) must be subject to state monopoly sales. In addition to allowing private merchants to operate freely, our state-owned trade companies must also control a large number of general bulk export materials in order to control foreign exchange and carry out international trade struggles. In addition, for general native products, as long as there is a market abroad, even if private merchants do not care about operating them, our state-owned trade companies are responsible for purchasing them and organizing exports. In terms of imports, our state-owned trade companies should not only purchase the daily necessities of the broad masses of people, but also appropriately organize the import of some production machines and necessary industrial raw materials. However, all goods that can be produced and self-sufficient domestically, or that can be produced but cannot be completely self-sufficient, will be prohibited or restricted from import in order to protect the recovery and development of national industry.
    According to the above tasks, the business operation policy of state-owned trade companies is to serve the people, support the development of production, and connect the exchange of materials between urban and rural areas as its basic policy. This is completely different from the sole purpose of private merchants to make profits. For example, at present, state-owned trade companies transport cotton from various parts of North China to Shanghai, and according to the market prices in the two places, it is bound to lose money. It will certainly lose money to transport grain from the Northeast and Southwest to Shanghai for sale. For another example, the cost of coal produced by the Kailuan Coal Mine is nearly twice as high as that of neighboring mines, but in order to take care of the lives of 200,000 miners and their families, our North China Coal and Iron Company purchases about 50% of its total output. Most of the nearly one million tons of coal currently stored by our North China Coal and Iron Company is Kailuan coal. Our Shanghai Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company often purchases the accumulated cotton yarn and cloth of private yarn factories at prices slightly higher than the market price in order to help alleviate the difficulties of slow sales of yarn and cloth and poor capital turnover of many private yarn factories. Private merchants will not do all these losing businesses; but in order to support production and regulate supply and demand, state-owned trade companies must do them.
    Does the operation of state-owned trade companies in the above-mentioned businesses mean that "the government only cares about public interests and not private interests in commerce"? We believe that this is not in line with the facts. The development and expansion of state-owned commerce is an indispensable part of the development of China's new democratic economy. It is not only not "competing with the people for profits", but also adopts an attitude of uniting and supporting the development of all private commercial enterprises that are beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood. For example, state-owned grain companies and cotton yarn and cloth companies in various places entrust private merchants to sell a large amount of grain, yarn, cloth, and other materials on their behalf while maintaining a certain profit. In the total value of import and export trade of more than 99.95 million US dollars in Tianjin last year (the data approved by the North China Foreign Trade Administration from March to December 28), the operation of private import and export merchants accounted for more than 60%. In addition, from other conditions, it can also be shown that private commerce today has a promising future. The real unification and democratic reforms across the country have created an unprecedentedly vast domestic market. Due to the development of production and the improvement of living standards after the land reform, the broad masses of farmers need private merchants to serve them in addition to state-owned stores and cooperatives. The work of mutual assistance between urban and rural areas and domestic and foreign exchanges depends on everyone to carry out. The current difficulties are temporary, and the development prospects of our industry and commerce are very bright. The private capitalist economy is one of the important components of the new democratic economy. All legitimate private commercial enterprises are protected by the government. All these conditions that are conducive to the development of private commerce are unprecedented. Therefore, we say that today's private commercial enterprises not only do not "have no business to do", but also have a lot of business to do. We hope that the business community will see the above points clearly, contribute their manpower and financial resources, and work hard to build a new democratic economy under the leadership of the state-owned economy.
    Summarizing the above, it is not difficult to understand that today our state-owned trade company is essentially different from the "state-owned" trade company of the Kuomintang reactionary government in the past. The Kuomintang government's state-owned trade organs' hoarding of materials, monopolizing the market, manipulating prices, and controlling foreign exchange were all behaviors to facilitate the bureaucratic bourgeoisie's corruption and fortune-making and to enrich their own pockets. They were the sources of destroying production, fluctuating prices, and creating speculation (the four major families were the largest speculators), and were opposed by the broad masses of people. Our state-owned trade company, on the other hand, serves the people and serves production. Therefore, it has won the support of the people all over the country.

　　论国营商业的任务
    杨波
    最近有些私营工商业者及一部分工作干部，对于今天国营贸易工作，曾提出一些意见。如说：“政府对工业是‘公私兼顾’，对商业却是只顾公不顾私”等。由于他们认识上的模糊，因之对人民民主政府现行经济政策中的“公私兼顾”政策，也就发生了许多不应有的怀疑。为此特将新民主主义经济中，国营商业的性质与任务略加论述。
    在中国人民政治协商会议共同纲领的经济政策中，一开始即规定：“中华人民共和国经济建设的根本方针，是以公私兼顾、劳资两利、城乡互助、内外交流的政策，达到发展生产、繁荣经济之目的。国家应在经营范围、原料供给、销售市场、劳动条件、技术设备、财政政策、金融政策等方面，调剂国营经济、合作社经济、农民和手工业者的个体经济、私人资本主义和国家资本主义经济，使各种社会经济成份在国营经济领导下，分工合作，各得其所，以促进整个社会经济的发展”。在商业方面，则规定：“保护一切合法的公私贸易。实行对外贸易的管制，并采用保护贸易政策。在国家统一的经济计划内实行国内贸易的自由，但对于扰乱市场的投机商业必须严格取缔。国营贸易机关应负调剂供求，稳定物价和扶助人民合作事业的责任……”。根据这一总的政策方针，在新民主主义的经济建设中，我国营贸易工作的任务，主要为：
    （一）扶助生产发展。国营贸易工作的一切活动，必须以发展各种有利于国计民生的生产事业为其主要目的。在农业方面：由于农业生产的季节性，历史上的统治阶级，皆曾充分地利用了这一特点，来进行对农民的残酷剥削。他们一方面压低价格收购农民的农产品；另方面则以高价卖给农民各种生活必需品，从中攫取暴利。今天我们的国营贸易公司则恰恰相反。它一方面廉价供给农民以各种主要的生产资料和生活资料，如农具、种籽、肥料和纱布等；另方面又以有利于农民再生产的价格，收购农民的各种剩余产品，以此来扶助农业生产，沟通城乡物资交流，使农民逐渐摆脱一层层的中间剥削，提高农民的购买力。如去年新花上市后，各地国营贸易公司收购棉花的价格，在华北区规定为每斤花不得少于八至十斤小米，山东为每斤花十二斤粗粮。在西北区去年新花上市时，由于国营贸易公司未及时收购，当地私商即尽量压低市价，以每斤花六斤左右小米的价格进行收购。后经我贸易公司发觉，为保障农民利益，实行大量收购，才维持到每斤花换八斤以上的小米。东北区在一九四六、四七年国营贸易公司初建立时，农民一吨粗粮，只能换到一匹半白细布，而去年经贸易公司的帮助，使农民一吨粗粮可以换到三匹多白细布。克服了工农产品不合理的剪刀差。
    在工业方面，则是保证原料供应，负责推销成品。如上海解放后，由于敌人的封锁，许多私人工商业家，当时皆感受原料缺乏，成品滞销之苦。但经我国营贸易公司的大力扶助，即很快改变了这一情况。半年来我贸易公司供给上海的主要工业原料、燃料，即有棉花四千余万斤，煤炭近百万吨，以及大量的木材、钢板、油料等原料。上海所产之纱、布等棉丝织品，五金器材，及其它生活日用品，亦大量组织向其它地区推销。在京津两市，一年来我国营贸易公司亦供给了棉花六十多万市担，各种加工粮食四万万余斤，以及大量的油料、烟叶、胶料、木材、硫磺等工业原料。并经营各种主要的工矿业产品：布三百多万匹，纱近五万件，煤一百五十万吨以上，蛋品一千五百余吨。此外京津两市的许多小工厂与手工业产品，由于没有一定的牌号，许多私商不愿代销。而我百货公司成立后，即予以收购或代销，解决了这些产品的销路问题。国营贸易公司这一切供给原料、推销成品的活动，无疑的是对整个社会生产事业的发展，起着有力的推动指导作用。
    （二）调剂供求，稳定物价，保证人民生活。一切私人商业的市场活动，虽有其一定的调剂供求的作用；但其本质是以营利为其经营的唯一目的。自由竞争追逐利润的结果，经常是在破坏着市场和物价的稳定。尤其在币值不稳的情况下，许多私商更惯于以囤积居奇、买空卖空等不法手段，哄抬物价，扰乱市场秩序。因此，国营贸易公司必须掌握大量的主要物资，调剂市场的供求，并通过群众合作社及自己的零售商店，直接供给广大劳动人民的日常生活必需品，借以稳定物价，安定民生，打击私商的投机活动。亦只有如此，才能加强我国营贸易公司控制市场的力量，保持并巩固我国营经济在商业上的领导地位。每当物价波动时，许多私商皆囤货不出。而我国营贸易公司则低于市价大量抛售。为保证各种主要物资的市场供应，免除私商对广大劳动人民的超额剥削，我国营贸易公司在各种主要物资（如粮、花、纱、布、油、煤、盐等）的经营上，不但应做批发生意，而且应通过合作社开展零售工作。
    （三）在对外贸易方面，我国营贸易公司是根据“奖出限入”的方针来进行工作的。在出口方面，凡足以左右国际市场的出口物资（如猪鬃）及各种战略物资（如钨、锑、锡等），必须实行国家的统销。一般的大宗出口物资，除准许私商自由经营外，我国营贸易公司，亦必须大量掌握，以便掌握外汇，进行国际贸易斗争。此外一般的土产品，只要国外有销路，即使私商不顾经营，我国营贸易公司，亦皆有责加以收购，组织出口。在进口方面，我国营贸易公司，除应采购广大人民之日常必需品外，还必须适当地组织一部分生产机器及必需的工业原料等进口。但凡我国内可以自行生产并能自给，或可能生产但不能完全自给的货物，即实行禁入或限入，借以保护民族工业的恢复与发展。
    根据以上任务，国营贸易公司的业务经营方针，是以为人民服务，扶助生产发展，沟通城乡物资交流为其基本方针。这与私商的以营利为其唯一目的是完全不同的。如目前国营贸易公司把华北各地的棉花运到上海，按两地市价计算，是非亏本不可的。把东北和西南的粮食运到上海出售，当然也要亏本。再如开滦煤矿所产之煤成本高于邻近各矿约近一倍，但为照顾二十万矿工及其家属的生活，我华北煤铁公司就收购其总产量的百分之五十左右。目前我华北煤铁公司所积存之近百万吨煤，大部即为开滦煤。我上海花纱布公司，为协助解除许多私营纱厂的纱布滞销，资金周转不灵的困难，经常以稍高于市场的价格，收购私营纱厂的积存纱布。这一切赔钱的生意，私商是不做的；但为扶助生产，调剂供求，国营贸易公司则不能不做。
    国营贸易公司对上述业务的经营，是否即说明“在商业上政府只顾公不顾私”呢？我们认为这是与事实不符的。国营商业的发展与扩大，是中国新民主主义经济发展中不可缺少的一部分。它不但不是“与民争利”，而且对于一切有利于国计民生的私营商业，是采取团结并扶助其发展的态度的。如我各地国营粮食公司、花纱布公司皆以大量的粮食、纱、布等物资，保持一定利润委托私商代为销售。去年天津九千九百五十多万美金的进出口贸易总值中（自三月至十二月二十八日经华北对外贸易管理局批准的数字），私营进出口商的经营，即占百分之六十以上。此外如从其它条件上来看，同样可以说明今天私营商业是有发展前途的。全国范围的真正的统一，和民主改革，造成了空前广大的国内市场。广大的农民群众在土改后由于生产发展，生活改善，他们除国营商店及合作社外，还需要私商服务。城乡互助、内外交流的工作有赖于大家去开展。目前的困难是暂时的，而我们工商业的发展前途，则是十分光明的。私人资本主义经济，是新民主主义经济的重要组成部分之一。一切正当的私营商业，是受到政府的保护的。这一切有利于私营商业发展的条件，皆是前所未有的。因此我们说，今天的私营商业，不但不是“没有买卖可做”，而且是大有买卖可做。我们希望工商界，看清上述诸点，拿出自己的人力、财力，在国营经济的领导下，为建设新民主主义经济而努力。
    总括以上所述，不难了解今天我们的国营贸易公司，与过去国民党反动政府的“国营”贸易公司，是有本质地区别的。国民党政府的国营贸易机关囤积物资、垄断市场、操纵物价、控制外汇等行为，是为便于官僚资产阶级贪污发财，中饱私囊的，是破坏生产、波动物价、制造投机的根源（四大家族即是最大的投机商），是为广大人民所反对的。而我们的国营贸易公司，则是为人民服务，为生产服务。因之它得到了全国人民的拥护。
