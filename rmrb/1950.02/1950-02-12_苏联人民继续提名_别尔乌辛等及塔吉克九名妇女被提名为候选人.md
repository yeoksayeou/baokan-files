Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, February 11th: TASS reports indicate that the Soviet people continue to nominate candidates for the Supreme Soviet. Soviet Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers, Belukhin, the famous advanced steelworker foreman Ivan Korobov (author of "Forty Years by the Blast Furnace"), and Angelina, who founded the Ukrainian women's tractor team, have all been nominated. Nominated to the Soviet of Nationalities are: Kuznetsov, Chairman of the All-Union Central Council of Trade Unions, the noted historian Gorekov, and the Ukrainian poet Rylsky, among others.

Collective farmers of the Armenian Republic nominated Stalin as a candidate, saying, "Although we are five thousand kilometers away from the Kremlin, the Soviet regime has led us, the poor reindeer herders, out of the forests and given us a happy life." Armenian expatriates who returned to their homeland with the help of the Soviet government enthusiastically spoke at the electorate meeting about the excitement and joy of enjoying the rights of Soviet citizens for the first time, and firmly supported Stalin.

Soviet women enjoy the same rights as men. Nine women from the Tajik Republic have been nominated as candidates for the Supreme Soviet. These include Balatova, chairman of the Stalin Collective Farm, who was awarded the Order of Lenin; collective farm chairwomen Asmanova and Rakhimova; and Order of Lenin recipient Polipiva, chairman of the Kulyab District Soviet Executive Committee, among others.

The Soviet State Publishing House has printed 12 million copies of 49 types of colored election propaganda posters, drawn by famous artists, calling on Soviet citizens to fulfill their patriotic duty.
