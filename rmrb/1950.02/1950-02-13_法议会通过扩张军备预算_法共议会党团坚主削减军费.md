　　French Parliament Passes Expanded Military Budget
    French Communist Party Parliamentary Group Insists on Military Spending Cuts
    [Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 9th] Paris dispatch: The French National Assembly passed the Bidault cabinet's 1950 budget of over 2.2 trillion francs on January 31st. Bidault submitted this largest budget in French history to the National Assembly in late December last year, which triggered fierce debates in the National Assembly and opposition from the Senate. Bidault threatened to resign the cabinet ten times in a row, and only managed to get it passed in the National Assembly with a majority of eight votes.
    The French Communist Party parliamentary group firmly demanded cuts in the military budget and proposed amendments to reduce the burden on the people, but these were all rejected by the government majority.
    This huge budget, amounting to $6.5 billion, is because France has joined the aggressive Atlantic Pact orchestrated by the United States, and must greatly expand its military to serve as cannon fodder in the new war being actively prepared by American imperialism. According to the Associated Press, if France does not pass this so-called "balanced budget," it will "lose $700 million in Marshall Plan aid."
    Continuing the colonial war in Vietnam is another important reason for this huge budget. Direct military spending in the 1950 budget amounted to 420 billion francs, or $1.2 billion, more than one-third of which is used to continue the offensive against the Vietnamese people.

### 法议会通过扩张军备预算  法共议会党团坚主削减军费

　　法议会通过扩张军备预算
    法共议会党团坚主削减军费
    【新华社北京九日电】巴黎讯：法国民议会于一月三十一日通过了皮杜尔内阁一九五○年数达二万二千余亿法郎的预算。皮杜尔于去年十二月下旬，向国民议会提出这个法国历史上最大的预算，曾引起国民议会的激烈辩论，遭到参议院的反对，皮杜尔连续十次以内阁辞职相威胁，始以八票的多数，在国民议会勉强获得通过。
    法国共产党议会党团曾坚决要求削减军事预算，并提出减轻人民负担的修正案，但都遭到政府多数派的否决。
    这个合六十五亿美元的庞大预算，是因为法国参加了美国所策划的侵略性的大西洋公约，必须大事扩张军备，以充当美帝国主义积极准备中的新战争的炮灰。据合众社指出，法国如不通过这个所谓“平衡预算”，就将“失去七亿美元的马歇尔计划援助”。
    继续进行越南的殖民战争，是这个庞大预算的另一重要原因。一九五○年预算中直接军事费达四千二百亿法郎，合十二亿美元，其中三分之一以上是用于继续进攻越南人民。
