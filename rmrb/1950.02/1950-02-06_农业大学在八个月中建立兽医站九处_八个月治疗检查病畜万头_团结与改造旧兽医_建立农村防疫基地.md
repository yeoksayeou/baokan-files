　　Agricultural University Establishes Nine Veterinary Stations in Eight Months
    Treats and Inspects Ten Thousand Head of Sick Livestock in Eight Months
    Unites and Transforms Old Veterinarians Establishes Rural Epidemic Prevention Bases
    [Our Newspaper's Dispatch] The Agricultural University has established nine veterinary education internship work stations in Baoding, Dingxian, Beijing and other places in the past eight months. There are 15 veterinarians and 34 students participating in the internship, and ten medical teams have been established. The work efficiency has increased from treating more than 100 livestock per month to treating more than 1,000 livestock per month. A total of 10,000 head of sick livestock have been treated and inspected in the past eight months. Students participating in internships at various stations attend classes for half a day and intern for half a day. Those who have studied for six months have laid a certain foundation for identifying and treating livestock diseases. After studying for another period, they will be able to master the technology; and those students who have some basic knowledge in the past have been able to independently master the technology and will be able to become good veterinary workers after another period of study. In addition to internships, the stations also pay attention to uniting and transforming old veterinarians. In Baoding and Dingxian, they organized veterinary symposiums to help old veterinarians learn. Liu Qinghe, a traditional Chinese veterinarian in Baoding, disclosed his tetanus treatment method, which had been kept secret for many years, after learning. In Chaoyangmenwai, Beijing, a veterinary association was organized to conduct technical research in groups on a regular basis. In the process of uniting and transforming old veterinarians, the stations also provided specific assistance to rural veterinarians in order to establish rural epidemic prevention bases. For example, when Station Director Yu Chuan prevented and controlled livestock epidemics in Wanxian and Mancheng, he worked with local administrative cadres in Nantaiyu and other villages to invite a veterinarian and a doctor with simple injection techniques to study the local prevention and control of animal diseases. He also sent students to teach them injection techniques and epidemic prevention knowledge. After that, the school handed over a portion of serum vaccine to the intern students and local village cadres to ensure the completion of the injection. This not only greatly saved manpower, but also laid the foundation for rural animal disease prevention work. In addition, the stations also regularly organize medical teams to go deep into the countryside to rescue and inspect sick livestock and publicize scientific methods of feeding and managing livestock to the masses. Based on the work experience of the past eight months, the seven veterinary stations in Beijing have decided to cooperate with relevant departments in Beijing to complete the anthrax bacillus injection of 29,000 livestock in the suburbs of Beijing by the end of March this year.

　　农业大学在八个月中建立兽医站九处
    八个月治疗检查病畜万头 
    团结与改造旧兽医  建立农村防疫基地
    【本报讯】农业大学在过去八个月中在保定、定县、北京等地建立兽医教育实习工作站九处，计有兽医十五人，另有学员三十四人参加实习，并建立了十个医疗小组，工作效率从每月医疗牲口百余头，提高到每月医疗牲口千头以上，总计八个月来已治疗、检查病畜一万头。参加各站实习的同学，半天上课，半天实习。学习满六个月的，对牲口病症的识别与治疗均已打下一定基础，再学习一个时期即可掌握技术；而过去有些基础的同学，则已能单独掌握技术，再学习一个时期，即可成为良好的兽医工作者。各站除实习外，并注意了团结与改造旧兽医。在保定、定县，他们曾组织了兽医座谈会，帮助旧兽医学习。保定中兽医刘庆和在学习后，将其保守秘密多年的破伤风疗法公开出来。在北京朝阳门外，则组织了兽医联合会，分组定期进行技术研究。在团结、改造旧兽医当中，各站还对农村兽医给予了具体帮助，借以建立农村防疫基地。如兽医站于船主任在完县、满城一带防治畜疫时，即在南台鱼等村，配合当地行政干部，邀集一个兽医和一个有简单注射技术的医生，研究了当地的防治兽疫工作，并派同学教给他们以注射技术、防疫常识，此后，该校即将一部分血清疫苗交给实习同学与当地村干部，保证注射完毕。这不仅大大节省了人力，而且给农村防治兽疫工作打下了基础。此外，各站并经常组织医疗队，深入农村抢救与检查病畜，向群众宣传科学的饲养与管理牲畜的方法。根据八个月来的工作经验，北京的七个兽医站，确定配合北京各有关机关，于本年三月底完成京郊二万九千头牲口的防治炭疽芽细菌注射。
