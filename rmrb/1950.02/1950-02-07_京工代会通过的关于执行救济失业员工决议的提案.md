　　京工代会通过的关于执行救济失业员工决议的提案
    【北京讯】京市首届工人代表大会昨（六）日通过的“保证切实执行北京市第二届各界人民代表会议“关于救济失业员工问题的决议”提案，全文如下：
    在十人以上的各公私营工厂和作坊中试办的失业救济，经第二届各界人民代表会议通过送交市政府，已由市政府劳动局于二月一日开始实施。
    此项失业救济制度与办法，正如原决议案中所说是为了“使各工厂作坊获得合理的改善经营、发展生产之条件，并适当保证工人之生活”。因此，我们北京市工人对这样既照顾生产又照顾工人生活的失业救济表示衷诚拥护，并以实际行动保证贯彻执行。
    为此，首届代表大会特作如下决议：
    一、十人以上的公私营工厂作坊在职员工，保证按规定每月缴纳工资的百分之一作为失业救济基金。
    二、领救济金的失业员工，在就业后保证分期缴还原领救济金总额的十分之一，作为失业救济基金。
    三、领救济金的失业员工，保证参加政府组织的半义务性质之公共工程和踊跃参加学习。
