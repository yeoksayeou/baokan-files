　　Supporting Mass Production, Correctly Using Grain Loans
    Tianjin Area Grain Loans are Being Distributed to Households
    [Report from Tianjin Special District] To rescue disaster victims in the Tianjin Special District of Hebei, nearly 50 million jin of grain for loans and relief has been mostly transported to disaster areas and is being widely distributed to households. Since late January, the central government and the Hebei Provincial Government allocated a large quantity of grain to the special district to rescue disaster victims and develop sideline and agricultural production. The district immediately launched gradual and in-depth mobilization and organization within the party, government, military, and civilian systems, vigorously carrying out grain transportation and lending work. As of the 12th of this month, 49.8 million jin of grain for loans and relief, excluding 6 million jin stored in the special district's supply and marketing cooperative for transportation, 43.8 million jin had been transported to grain base stations and disaster areas in various counties and towns, and is being widely distributed to households. Emergency relief grain and livestock feed grain loans have been largely distributed to households in Hangu Town, Shengfang Town, and Yongqing, Anci, Jinghai, and Wuqing counties. In terms of exchanging coarse grain for fine grain and selling grain, according to incomplete statistics from Yangliuqing Town, Yongqing, Anci, Tianjin, and Jinghai counties, 1.72 million jin have been distributed to households in over 300 villages. Regarding spring wheat (79 wheat) seed loans, 1.4 million jin have been loaned to over 350 villages in Ninghe, Jinghai, Wuqing, Ba County, and Baodi counties alone. In the distribution of the above-mentioned grains, all counties and towns prioritized severely affected areas and villages surrounded by water. Except for Ninghe and Baodi, which are still distributing to villages surrounded by water, 186 villages surrounded by water in Tianjin, Jinghai, Ba County, Anci, Wuqing, and other counties have all received the grain in the villages, and most of it has reached households, so there should be no major problems in surviving the thaw period. After receiving the various grains, the disaster victims are in high spirits and are immediately organizing various forms of production. In the process of distributing relief and loan grain, the following experiences have been gained:

    1.  Investigate and study the situation, distinguish between priorities, and implement distribution in a step-by-step manner. Jinghai and Anci first focused on distributing to severely affected villages surrounded by water, and then turned to general severely affected villages. In order to rescue disaster victims, relief grain should be quickly distributed first. Various grains to support production should be gradually distributed along with the organization of production, and should not be rushed to avoid lending grain for unintended purposes. Three districts in Dacheng County understood and analyzed the different situations among the masses in advance, and used this as a basis for distribution, distributing grain to households in six villages reasonably and quickly. Anci Xidesheng Village lacked investigation and research in advance, and blindly distributed grain, so that a willow weaving group, which only needed a loan of 500 jin of grain to support its development, ended up being loaned 1,500 jin, which not only wasted grain, but also fostered the masses' dependence.

    2.  Relying on the branch and cadres to mobilize the masses to conduct evaluation can achieve fair and reasonable distribution. In the distribution of relief and loan grain in the fifth district of Ba County, the village branch first discussed the distribution targets and quantities and put forward preliminary opinions. Then, a review committee composed of village cadres from various departments and representatives elected by the masses conducted the review to determine the list of those who should receive relief and grain loans and the amount of allocation. Then, a mass meeting was held to discuss and approve it. At the above meetings, the source, use, conditions for loan targets, and repayment dates of the grain were explained to enable the masses to fully discuss. Finally, after approval by the district, distribution was carried out. Relief grain has been distributed to households in eight villages, including Jianchapu and Pingkou, which is generally fair and reasonable. In some districts of Dacheng, the standards for relief and loan grain distribution targets and the use of grain were not well publicized, and evaluation was not conducted in a guided manner, resulting in village cadres selfishly occupying more grain, the masses exaggerating their difficulties and reporting more for themselves, and no one publicly discussing the matter.

    3.  The close integration of grain loan distribution with the organization and mobilization of production can ensure that the grain loan is used properly. It should be clearly recognized that the process of lending various grains to support production is the process of organizing production. Before lending grain, the Yongba Work Team implemented voluntary mutual assistance and group formation among the masses according to different industries, made production plans, studied how much capital was still lacking in addition to self-financing, and submitted requests for evaluation, approval, and grain distribution. Production was started immediately after the grain was distributed. Only in this way can it be guaranteed that the grain loan will achieve the purpose of supporting the masses in carrying out production. (Zhu Zhirong, Yang Jinxiu)

### 支持群众生产  正确使用贷粮  天津区贷粮正发到各户

　　支持群众生产  正确使用贷粮
    天津区贷粮正发到各户
    【本报天津专区讯】河北天津专区抢救灾民，贷粮赈粮近五千万斤粮食已大部运发灾区，正普遍发放到户。自一月下旬，中央政府和河北省府为抢救灾民，开展副业、农业生产，拨给该专区大批粮食，该区立即在党、政、军、民各系统中，逐渐深入动员与组织，大力进行粮食运输和贷放工作。至本月十二日止，贷粮赈粮四千九百八十万斤，除六百万斤存专区供销总社待运外，四千三百八十余万斤已运到各县镇粮食基点站与灾区，并正在普遍向户发放。急赈粮、牲口草料贷粮等项粮食，汉沽镇、胜芳镇和永清、安次、静海、武清县已大部发放到户。以粗换细和售粮，据杨柳青镇、永清、安次、天津、静海各县不完全统计，有三百余村一百七十二万斤发放到户。春麦（七九麦）贷种，仅宁河、静海、武清、霸县、宝坻五县即有三百五十余村一百四十万斤贷放到户。上述各种粮食的发放，各县镇均先尽重灾区和水围村，除宁河、宝坻正向水围村发放外，天津、静海、霸县、安次、武清等县一百八十六个水围村已全部到村并大部到户，渡过化冻期将无大问题。灾民在领到各种粮食后，情绪极为高涨，并即组织各种生产。并在赈贷粮的发放过程中，获得如下经验：
    一、调查研究情况，分清轻重缓急，实行有步骤的发放。静海、安次，首先着重了水围的重灾村发放。其次再转到一般重灾村。为抢救灾民，救济粮应首先迅速发放。而各种扶助生产粮，则应该是随着组织生产，逐渐发放下去，不应急于求成，致使贷非所用。大城三区事先了解分析了群众中有不同情况，做为发放依据，合理而很快的在六个村将粮发放到户。安次西德胜村事先缺乏调查研究，盲目的发放，使柳编业一组，本须贷粮五百斤即可扶植发展，结果贷给一千五百斤，不但浪费了粮食，并助长了群众的依赖思想。
    二、依靠支部与干部发动群众进行评议，才能做到分配的公平合理。霸县五区发放的赈贷粮，首先经过村支部讨论发放对象及数量，提出初步意见。然后经由各部门村干部和群众推选的代表组成评议委员会，进行评议，确定应救济与应贷粮的名单及分配数量，再召开群众大会讨论和通过。在上述各会议上，并讲解粮食的来源、用途及贷放对象的条件、归还日期等问题。使群众充分讨论。最后经区批准，进行发放。煎茶铺、平口等八个村赈粮已发到户，一般比较公平合理。大城有的区未很好的宣传赈贷粮发放对象的标准与粮食用途，亦未有领导的进行评议，造成了村干自私多占，群众也夸大困难，多自报，无人公议等的现象。
    三、发放贷粮与组织发动生产密切结合才能使贷粮用之得当。应该明确认识各种扶助生产粮食的贷放过程，即是组织生产的过程。永霸工作团在贷粮之先，依据不同行业，实行群众自愿互助结组，做出生产计划，研究除自行集资外，尚缺多少资本，提出要求经过评议，批准，发粮。粮食发到后即搞起了生产。这样才能保证使贷粮达到支持群众开展生产的目的。（朱之荣、杨进修）
