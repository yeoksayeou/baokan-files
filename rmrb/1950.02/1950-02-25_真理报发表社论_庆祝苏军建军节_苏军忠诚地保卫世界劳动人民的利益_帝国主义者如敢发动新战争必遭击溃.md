Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, February 24th: TASS, Moscow, February 23rd: Soviet newspapers prominently featured on Soviet Army Day a large photograph of Marshal Stalin, the great leader and beloved teacher who inspired and organized all victories of the Soviet people and their armed forces, as well as the order issued by Marshal Vasilevsky, Minister of the Armed Forces of the Soviet Union.

    *Pravda* published an editorial stating: The Soviet Army is the pride of our people, the loyal defender of the interests of the Soviet state, and the reliable sentinel of the cause of world peace. The founders of the Soviet Army, the great leaders of the Bolshevik Party and the Soviet state, Lenin and Stalin, educated our army in the spirit of supreme loyalty to the socialist motherland. Under the genius leadership of Comrade Stalin, our armed forces' battle flag is draped in the immortal glory of victory.

    The Soviet Army is the product of the most progressive social and state system—the Soviet system. The Soviet Army is a new type of army, the army of liberated workers and peasants, the army of friendship of all nationalities in our country. This army has an inseparable link with the people. This army enjoys the love and respect of all working people in the Soviet Union. Filled with the spirit of internationalism, the Soviet Army, from the day it was founded, has faithfully defended the interests of the working people of all countries. Comrade Stalin pointed out: This is the reason why our army has countless friends and allies everywhere in the world—from Shanghai to New York, from London to Calcutta.

    The Soviet Union leads the powerful camp of peace, democracy, and socialism. It consistently and unwaveringly carries out an unyielding struggle to strive for international cooperation, universal peace, and friendship among all nations. The peace policy of the Soviet state conforms to the vital interests of our people and all mankind. In the future, the Soviet people will continue to spare no effort to strengthen and expand the powerful front of peace advocates, thwart the aggressive plans of the imperialist warmongers, and make war impossible. The Communist Party will, as always, tirelessly struggle for international cooperation and world peace.

    The Soviet people are convinced of the invincible strength of the socialist state. Attempts to intimidate the Soviet people with "atomic" or any other kind of blackmail will not succeed! Historical experience proves eloquently enough that it is the imperialist aggressors who fear war, not us, because war will lead to their inevitable collapse. The Soviet people are convinced that if the imperialists launch a new war against our peace-loving country, then the Soviet Union, supported by all freedom-loving people in the world, will defeat any aggressor.

    Long live the Soviet Armed Forces, may they exist and grow stronger for the happiness of working humanity!

    Long live Comrade Stalin, the brilliant commander, our great leader, and beloved teacher!

    庆祝苏军建军节
    苏军忠诚地保卫世界劳动人民的利益  帝国主义者如敢发动新战争必遭击溃
    【新华社北京二十四日电】塔斯社莫斯科二十三日讯：苏联各报在苏军建军节以显著地位刊载苏联人民及其武装部队的一切胜利的鼓舞者与组织者斯大林大元帅的巨幅照片及苏联武装部队部部长华西列夫斯基元帅发布的命令。
    真理报发表社论称：苏军是我国人民的骄傲，是苏联国家利益的忠诚的保卫者和全世界和平事业的可靠的哨兵。苏军的创立者、布尔什维克党和苏维埃国家的伟大领袖--列宁和斯大林，曾以对社会主义祖国的最高忠诚的精神教育我们的军队。在伟大的统帅--斯大林同志的天才指导下，我国武装部队的战旗上披上了不朽的胜利的光荣。
    苏军是最进步的社会与国家制度--苏维埃制度的产物。苏军是新型的军队，是解放了的工农的军队，是我国各民族友爱的军队。这一军队与人民有着不可分割的联系。这一军队享有苏联全国劳动人民的热爱与尊敬。充满国际主义精神的苏军，从它创立之日起，就忠诚地保卫着一切国家的劳动人民的利益。斯大林同志指出：这就是我们的军队在世界各地--从上海到纽约、从伦敦到加尔各答之所以有着无法计算的朋友和盟友的理由。
    苏联领导着强大的和平、民主与社会主义阵营，它始终如一地和坚守不渝地进行着不屈不挠的斗争，以争取国际合作、争取普遍和平与争取各民族友好。苏维埃国家的和平政策，符合于我国人民及全体人类的切身利益。在将来，苏联人民，将同样不遗余力地用各种方法加强及扩大强大的和平拥护者阵线，挫败帝国主义战争贩子的侵略计划，并使战争成为不可能。共产党在今后将一如往昔不倦地为国际合作与全世界和平而斗争。
    苏联人民确信社会主义国家的无敌的力量。企图以“原子”或任何别的讹诈来恫吓苏联人民，是不能成功的！历史的经验足够雄辩地证明：害怕战争的正是帝国主义侵略者而不是我们，因为战争将引致他们的不可避免的崩溃。苏联人民确信：要是帝国主义者发动新战争，反对我们爱好和平的国家，那么，为全世界爱好自由的人民所支持的苏联，将击溃任何侵略者。
    祝苏联武装部队为了劳动人类的幸福而长存和壮大！
    天才的统帅-我们伟大的领袖和热爱的导师斯大林同志万岁！
