Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 8th:

Vice Premier Dong Biwu of the Central People's Government, upon learning of the Kuomintang remnant bandits' frantic and indiscriminate bombing of the people of Shanghai, sent a message of condolence to all the people of Shanghai on the 8th. The text of the telegram is as follows:

To the Shanghai Municipal People's Government, to be forwarded to all the People of Shanghai:

On behalf of the Central People's Government, I extend my deep condolences to you – the people of Shanghai who have suffered from the frantic bombing by the Kuomintang remnant bandits – and express my condolences to the compatriots who died.

The bloody atrocities committed by the Kuomintang remnant bandits in Taiwan, with the direct participation of American imperialism and Japanese aggressors, can never shake our will to build a new people's Shanghai, but will only make our struggle against imperialism and its running dogs more resolute. We deeply know that the fundamental way to defeat the enemy's bombing is to recover the Zhoushan Islands and Taiwan. Therefore, we must intensify our efforts under difficult conditions, build our People's Navy and People's Air Force, support the People's Liberation Army, fight to the Zhoushan Islands and Taiwan, and resolutely, thoroughly, cleanly, and completely eliminate the remnant bandits and their foreign accomplices there. People from all walks of life in Shanghai must continue to unite as one, under the leadership of the East China Military and Political Committee and the Shanghai Municipal People's Government, to overcome serious difficulties, to support the liberation of the Zhoushan Islands and Taiwan, to build a new Shanghai, and to fight to avenge the dead. The Central People's Government and the people of the whole country will continue to assist your struggle with the greatest efforts.

Dong Biwu, Vice Premier of the State Council of the Central People's Government, February 8, 1950

　　董副总理代表中央人民政府
    电慰上海市人民
    号召加紧努力解放舟山群岛和台湾  彻底消灭那里的残匪及其外国帮凶
    【新华社北京八日电】中央人民政府董必武副总理，在得悉国民党残匪疯狂滥炸上海人民的消息后，特于八日向上海市全体人民发出慰问电。电文如下：上海市人民政府转上海市全体人民：
    我谨代表中央人民政府向你们——身受国民党残匪疯狂轰炸的上海市全体人民致深切的慰问，并向死难的同胞致以哀悼。
    台湾国民党残匪在美帝国主义与日本侵略分子直接参与之下所制造的血腥暴行，决不可能动摇我们建设人民新上海的意志，而只能使我们对帝国主义及其走狗的斗争更加坚决。我们深知：战胜敌人轰炸的根本办法，就是收复舟山群岛和台湾。因此，我们必需在困难的条件下加紧努力，建设我们的人民海军和人民空军，支援人民解放军，打到舟山群岛和台湾去，坚决彻底、干净全部地消灭那里的残余匪敌及其外国帮凶。上海各界人民更要继续团结一致，在华东军政委员会和上海市人民政府的领导之下，战胜严重的困难，为支援解放舟山群岛和台湾，建设新上海，替死难者报仇而斗争。中央人民政府和全国人民，必继续以最大的努力，来援助你们的奋斗。
  中央人民政府政务院副总理董必武  一九五○年二月八日
