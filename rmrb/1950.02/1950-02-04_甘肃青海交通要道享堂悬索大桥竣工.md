　　Xiangtang Suspension Bridge Completed, Vital Transportation Artery Between Gansu and Qinghai

　　[Lanzhou News] The vital Xiangtang Suspension Bridge, connecting the provinces of Gansu and Qinghai, was completed on January 9th and officially opened for trial traffic on the 10th, with good results. The original Xiangtang Datong River steel truss bridge (120 kilometers from Lanzhou) was completely destroyed by the fleeing remnants of Ma Bufang's bandit gang in September of last year. After liberation, the Northwest Highway Engineering Administration of the Lanzhou Military Control Commission's Transportation Department began emergency repairs on October 7th of last year, transforming it into the first new-style "suspension bridge" in Gansu and Qinghai provinces. The bridge is 32 meters long and 5 meters wide, with a height of more than 30 meters from the bridge deck to the riverbed, and a load capacity of 10 metric tons. It was originally planned to be completed in four months, but all the workers, recognizing that this bridge repair was for the benefit of the people and the motherland, demonstrated a high degree of labor enthusiasm, and the nearby residents also frequently volunteered to help with the work, so it was completed within three months ahead of schedule.

　　甘肃青海交通要道享堂悬索大桥竣工
    【兰州讯】贯通甘肃、青海两省交通的要道享堂悬索桥，已于一月九日修建完成，十日正式试行通车，情形良好。按原享堂大通河钢架桥（距兰州一百二十公里），去年九月马步芳残匪溃逃时，曾全部炸毁，解放后经兰州市军管会交通处西北公路工程管理局于去年十月七日开始抢修，改建成甘肃、青海两省的第一座新式“悬索桥”。桥长三十二公尺，宽五公尺，由桥面至河底高约三十余公尺，载重量十公吨。原计划四个月完工，但在全体工人认识到这次修桥是为了人民祖国，发挥了高度的劳动热忱，附近居民也经常自动帮助工作，因此提前于三个月内完工。
