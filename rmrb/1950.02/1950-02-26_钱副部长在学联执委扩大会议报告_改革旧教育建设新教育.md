　　Vice Minister Qian Reports at the Enlarged Meeting of the All-China Students' Federation Executive Committee
    Reforming Old Education and Building New Education
    [Reported by this newspaper] Qian Junrui, Vice Minister of Education of the Central People's Government, delivered a report on "Reforming Old Education and Building New Education" at the enlarged meeting of the Executive Committee of the All-China Students' Federation on the 20th. In his report, Vice Minister Qian first analyzed the basic situation of China's current education. He said: In order to victoriously carry out overall construction, the culture of workers, peasants, the People's Liberation Army, and other laborers across the country must be rapidly improved; revolutionary political education must be widely carried out to eliminate feudal, comprador, and fascist ideas, develop the idea of serving the people, and enhance the people's awareness and enthusiasm to participate in construction; a large number of construction cadres for the country must be cultivated.

    Current Basic Situation of Education
    Currently, our People's Liberation Army has universal and good cultural, political, and military education; workers and peasants across the country, in addition to running a small number of literacy classes, spare-time schools, and winter schools in the old liberated areas, still extremely lack regular cultural education. There are currently about 200 universities and specialized colleges in the country, with no more than 150,000 students; about 5,000 middle schools, with about 1.5 million students; and about 300,000 primary schools, with more than 20 million students. These schools: First, the quantity is too small, which is not suitable for the cultural needs of workers, peasants, and their children nationwide; students in higher education, on a national scale, are mostly children of urban petty bourgeoisie and above, with very few genuine workers, peasants, and their children. It should be said that this is extremely inconsistent with the basic situation of today's New China. Second, the vast majority of these schools are still implementing the old education, and their content, methods, and systems are basically unable to meet the needs of the new country, and must be thoroughly and steadily transformed. The new education that can meet the needs of the people's country, although having a certain foundation, is still far from perfect and mature, and its content and form are still far from adapting to the current and future needs, and must be greatly improved, strengthened, and developed according to the new environment and using new experiences.

    Four Tasks in the Current Stage
    Vice Minister Qian then pointed out, based on the New Democracy education policy and principles stipulated in the Common Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and the current specific situation, that: In the present and future years, our education work should focus on:

    (1) Opening all levels of schools to workers, peasants, and laborers, focusing on promoting spare-time literacy education for laborers, preparing to popularize adult literacy education, and cultivating new-type intellectuals from worker and peasant backgrounds.

    (2) Implementing the combination of education and production, strengthening science and technology education in schools at all levels, creating secondary and higher technical schools, and cultivating a large number of construction talents.

    (3) Strengthening revolutionary political education for young students and old intellectuals.

    (4) Resolutely and systematically reform the curriculum, teaching materials, teaching methods, and systems of the old education.

    Further Building and Developing New Education
    Regarding the building of new education, Vice Minister Qian pointed out that China's new education, that is, the new democratic education, has a history of more than 20 years. This new education is the product of a long-term rural environment and war environment. Now there are new domestic and international environments, and various different new conditions. We must build and develop new education further on the basis of the original good experience, absorb some useful aspects of the old education, and especially draw on the experience of Soviet education construction.

    For this purpose, we must:

    (1) Establish the Renmin University of China, use the Soviet Union's construction experience in various fields, absorb workers, peasants, and progressive young intellectuals, and cultivate a large number of new construction cadres.

    (2) Universally run workers' and peasants' short-course middle schools, absorb worker and peasant cadres and young people, provide them with secondary cultural and scientific knowledge, and enable them to continue their studies and undertake arduous construction tasks.

    (3) Universally carry out spare-time literacy education among workers, peasants, and organizations at all levels, and provide primary and secondary cultural education to all those who do not leave their production and work posts.

    (4) Promote adult literacy education for workers, peasants, soldiers, and petty urban residents, in order to eliminate illiteracy within a few years.

    Resolutely and Steadily Reform Old Education
    Regarding the reform of old education, Vice Minister Qian pointed out that the reform of old education is an arduous process, because by its nature, it is a process of ideological transformation, and it should not be rushed, and must proceed resolutely and steadily.

    The basic purpose of reforming old education is to make education completely subordinate to the needs of the people's revolution and the people's construction, and subordinate to the realization of the people's interests. The main contents of the reform are the reform of the curriculum and the reform of teaching methods; and on this basis, in line with construction needs, gradually reform the school system, teaching materials, and so on.

    The primary step in curriculum reform is to open and strengthen revolutionary political courses (including the history of social development, dialectical materialism and historical materialism, political economy, New Democracy, etc.), and abolish reactionary courses (including the Kuomintang Party Ideology, the Six Codes, etc.). It is still necessary to offer specialized political courses in middle schools for the time being, and it can be gradually abolished later when other subjects have stronger political content. Political and ideological education in primary schools should be implemented entirely through stories, games, and other extracurricular activities. In the new areas, all young intellectuals and old intellectuals must universally conduct revolutionary ideological and political study; in the semi-old areas, political study should strive to be combined with various specific tasks and improved one step further.

    Another important step in curriculum reform is to strive to be practical and rationally implement simplification. The principle is to eliminate all harmful and unnecessary content for construction, strengthen and add content urgently needed for national construction, reduce content that is not very needed for construction, and appropriately reduce the amount and strive to improve quality, in order to achieve the healthy development of students' physical and mental health. This work is a complex and meticulous work, and must be implemented systematically and step by step according to the actual needs of national construction and guided by a high degree of scientific knowledge, and must not be impatient.

    At present, the focus of reforming teaching methods is to oppose dogmatism that separates books from reality, and resolutely implement the unity of theory and practice. But at the same time, we should prevent narrow pragmatism that despises the systematic study of theory. The cramming teaching method must be abandoned. Design teaching without the guidance of correct and systematic theoretical knowledge and so-called experiments that deviate from the possible popularization and promotion must be criticized, and the content and methods of school examinations and entrance examinations must be improved. The so-called social education during the Kuomintang rule must be abolished for its reactionary educational content and formalistic methods, and the experience of the old liberated areas should be fully utilized, and popular forms that are popular with the masses, especially workers and peasants, should be adopted to implement literacy education, political current affairs education, and spare-time cultural, scientific, and technical education.

    Three Major Tasks of Students in Educational Construction
    Regarding the tasks of students in educational construction, Vice Minister Qian pointed out that the tens of millions of young people and children who have been united and should be united by the All-China Students' Federation are the objects to be cultivated by the new Chinese education, and also the infinite hopes that our great country has accumulated. Therefore, first of all, we suggest to the All-China Students' Federation to call on and use all its strength to help the students across the country to fully understand the glory and importance of their tasks, consciously and actively, and use the method of unity of theory and practice, to step up the study of New Democracy, study politics, study culture, and study science and technology. First of all, make themselves healthy citizens who love the motherland, love the people, love labor, love science, and cherish public property, and make themselves construction backbones who master excellent cultural heritage and master science and technology. The idea of new patriotism should be established and consolidated among students, and on this basis, master culture and technology to serve the motherland and the people.

    Secondly, building new education and transforming old education is a mass action. Here, teachers occupy a leading and decisive position. However, in certain occasions and to a certain extent, the active cooperation, assistance and promotion of students are necessary and beneficial. For example, in the early stage of political study, under the slogan of "mutual assistance between teachers and students and mutual growth in teaching," students, through learning organizations, played a not small role in carrying out and improving learning. In reforming school administration and teaching methods, students' active provision of opinions and assistance in improvement have also been effective. In the future, this experience should be systematically promoted, and the transformation and development of education should be appropriately assisted from the bottom up.

    Third, the construction of new education, especially opening schools to workers and peasants, requires vigorous assistance from the vast number of young intellectuals in order to promote spare-time literacy education and adult literacy movements. Senior university students can help run workers' and peasants' short-course middle schools, middle school students and normal school students can help run short-course primary schools, and all young students have the responsibility to be cultural teachers for workers and peasants, and become the main teachers of a part of the promotion of workers' and peasants' literacy education. Your help will rapidly improve the cultural level of the working and peasant masses, and will cultivate a large number of intellectuals of the working class and peasant class in the near future, which is an extremely great contribution to the construction of New China.

    Vice Minister Qian said in his concluding remarks: Thanks to the correct leadership of the Central People's Government and the Communist Party of China, thanks to the efforts of educational workers across the country and the effective cooperation of all parties, coupled with the conscious efforts and assistance of students across the country, the new education of our great motherland will surely have brilliant success. The brilliant high tide of cultural and educational construction will surely come before long.

　　钱副部长在学联执委扩大会议报告
    改革旧教育建设新教育
    【本报讯】中央人民政府教育部副部长钱俊瑞二十日在全国学联执委会扩大会议上作了“改革旧教育，建设新教育”的报告。钱副部长在报告中首先分析了目前中国教育的基本情况，他说：为了胜利地进行全面建设，全国工人、农民、人民解放军和其他劳动者的文化必须迅速提高；必须广泛进行革命的政治教育，以肃清封建的、买办的、法西斯主义的思想，发展为人民服务的思想，并提高人民参加建设的自觉性与积极性；必须大量培养国家的建设干部。
    目前教育基本情况
    现在，我全国解放军有普遍的良好的文化、政治与军事教育；全国工人和农民除办有少数识字班、业余学校和老解放区办有冬学外，还极端缺乏经常的文化教育。全国现有大学和专科学校约二百所，学生不超过十五万人；中等学校约五千所，学生约一百五十万人；小学约三十万所，学生约二千余万人。这些学校：第一是数量太少，对全国工、农及其子女的文化要求不相适应；高级学校的学生在全国范围讲，绝大多数还是城市小资产阶级以上的子女，真正的工农及其子女还是极少数。应该说，这与今天新中国的基本情况极不相称。第二，这些学校的极大多数还在实行旧教育，其内容、方法、制度基本上不能适应新国家的需要，必须实行彻底的和稳步的改造。那种能够适应人民国家需要的新教育，虽有一定的基础，但还远远不到完备和成熟的地步，其内容与形式也还远远不够适应当前与今后的需要，还必须根据新环境，运用新经验，大大加以改进、加强和发展。
    现阶段的四项工作
    钱副部长继根据人民政协共同纲领规定的新民主主义教育方针和政策，以及当前的具体情况，指出：现在和今后若干年内，我们的教育工作应该着重做到：
    （一）各级学校向工农劳动人民开门，着重地推行劳动者的业余补习教育，准备普及成人识字教育，培养工农出身的新型知识分子。
    （二）实行教育与生产结合，在各级学校加强科学技术教育，创设中等和高等技术学校，培养大批建设人才。
    （三）加强对青年学生与旧知识分子的革命政治教育。
    （四）坚决地和有计划有步骤地改革旧教育的课程、教材、教学法和制度。
    进一步建设和发展新教育
    关于建设新教育，钱副部长指出：中国的新教育，即新民主主义的教育，已有二十多年的历史。这种新教育是长期农村环境与战争环境的产物。现在有了新的国内环境和国际环境，有了各种不同的新条件。我们必须以原有良好的经验为基础，吸收旧教育的某些有用的方面，特别要借助于苏联教育建设的经验，来进一步建设和发展新教育。
    为此目的，我们要：
    （一）创办中国人民大学，运用苏联各项建设经验，吸收工农和进步知识青年，培养大批新的建设干部。
    （二）普遍举办工农速成中学，吸收工农干部和工农青年，给以中等文化科学知识，使其继续深造，担任艰巨的建设任务。
    （三）在工人农民和各级机关团体中，普遍进行业余补习教育，对一切不脱离生产和工作岗位的人，给以初等和中等的文化教育。
    （四）推行工、农、兵和小市民的成人识字教育，以期在若干年内，扫除文盲。
    坚决而稳步地改革旧教育
    关于改革旧教育，钱副部长指出：改革旧教育是一个艰巨的过程，因为按其性质，乃是一种思想改造的过程，决不宜操之过急，必须坚决而稳步地前进。
    改革旧教育的基本目的，在于使教育完全服从于人民革命与人民建设的需要，服从于人民利益的实现。改革的主要内容，一是课程的改革，二是教学方法的改革；并以此为基础，配合建设需要，逐步改革学制、教材等等。
    课程改革的首要步骤是开设和加强革命的政治课（包括社会发展史、辩证唯物论与历史唯物论、政治经济学、新民主主义论等），废除反动的课程（包括国民党党义，六法全书等）。在中学开设专门的政治课，目前还有必要，等到以后其他各科都有较强的政治内容以后，才可逐步取消。小学的政治思想教育，则完全用故事、游戏和其他课外活动的方式实施。在新区，一切知识青年和旧知识分子须要普遍进行革命的思想政治学习；在半老区，政治学习应力求和各种具体业务结合，并提高一步。
    课程改革的另一重要步骤是力求切合实际，合理地实行精简。其原则是取消一切有害的和为建设所不需要的内容，加强和添设为国家建设所急需的内容，减少为建设所不很需要的内容，应适当地缩减分量，力求提高质量，以求学生身心的健全发展。这一工作是复杂细致的工作，必须根据国家各项建设的实际需要，并以高度的科学知识为指导，有计划有步骤地实行，决不能性急。
    目前改革教学方法的重点是反对书本与实际脱离的教条主义，坚决实行理论与实际的一致。但同时应防止轻视有系统地学习理论的狭隘实用主义。填鸭式的教学法必须抛弃。没有正确和系统的理论知识为指导的设计教学与脱离普及推行可能的所谓实验，必须加以批判，学校考试和入学考试的内容和方法必须改进。对国民党统治时期的所谓社会教育，必须废除其反动的教育内容和形式主义的一套方法，而充分运用老解放区的经验，采取群众首先是工农，所喜闻乐见的民间形式，实施识字教育政治时事教育和业余文化科学技术教育。
    学生在教育建设中的三大任务
    钱副部长对于学生在教育建设中的任务，指出：为全国学联所已经团结和应该团结的几千万青年和儿童，就是新中国教育所要培养的对象，也就是我们伟大的国家所蕴蓄着的无穷无尽的希望。因此首先我们向全国学联建议号召，并用一切力量帮助全国的同学们，充分理解自己任务的光荣和重大，自觉和积极地，并用理论与实际一致的方法，加紧新民主主义的学习，学习政治，学习文化，学习科学技术。首先使自己成为热爱祖国，热爱人民，爱好劳动，爱好科学，爱护公共财物的健全公民，并使自己成为掌握优秀的文化遗产，掌握科学技术的建设骨干。应在同学中确立和巩固新爱国主义的思想，以此为基础，来掌握文化与技术，为祖国与人民服务。
    其次，建设新教育，改造旧教育，是一个广大群众的行动。在这里，教师是居于主导的和决定的地位。但在一定场合和一定程度上，学生的积极配合、帮助和推动，是必要的和有益的。比如在政治学习的初期，在“师生互助，教学相长”的口号下，同学们经过学习组织，对进行与改进学习曾起了不小的作用。在改革学校行政和教学方法方面，同学的积极提供意见，并帮助改进，也有效果。今后应有系统地发扬这种经验，适当地自下而上地辅助教育的改造和发展。
    第三，新教育的建设，特别是使学校为工农开门，要推行业余补习教育和成人识字运动，需要广大青年知识分子的大力帮助。大学高年级的同学可以帮助办理工农速成中学，中学生和师范生可以帮助办理速成小学，而一切青年学生们都有责任当工农群众的文化教员，成为推行工农识字教育的一部分的主要教员。你们的帮助将使工农群众的文化水平迅速提高，将在不久的将来培养起来大批工农阶级自己的知识分子，这对于新中国的建设是一项极其伟大的贡献。
    钱副部长在结语中说：由于中央人民政府和中国共产党的正确领导，由于全国教育工作者的努力和各方面有效的配合，再加上全国同学们的自觉努力和帮助，我们伟大祖国的新教育一定会有辉煌的成功。光明灿烂的文化教育建设高潮一定不要很久就会来到。
