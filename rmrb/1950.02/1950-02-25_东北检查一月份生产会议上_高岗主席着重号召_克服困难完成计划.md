Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 23rd. The Northeast People's Government's Industry Department convened an enlarged departmental meeting on the 4th of this month to inspect the completion of the January production plans by various units. Gao Gang, Chairman of the Northeast People's Government, also attended and provided guidance. The meeting criticized units that had not completed their plans and clearly stated that the concept of resolutely abiding by and completing plans must be established, and the rural, undisciplined work style of not following plans must be combatted. According to a report by the Deputy Director of the Planning Department of the Industry Department at the meeting, among the 33 major products in the monthly reports of various factories and mines, 19 products, including coal, copper, lead, cement, cotton cloth, and cotton yarn, were completed or exceeded their plans, achieving 108 to 154 percent of the planned targets. Fourteen products did not complete their plans, such as iron ore, which only achieved 87 percent of the plan, pig iron, which achieved 96.7 percent, and coke, which achieved 89 percent. The products with the lowest completion rates, such as bicycles and V-belts, only reached about 50 percent of the planned output. The responsible persons of various bureaus and companies that had not completed their plans conducted self-criticism at the meeting. Most believed that the main reasons for the failure to complete the January plan were: unsound production organization, lax enforcement of labor discipline, lack of strict inspection and mechanical maintenance systems, and untimely supply of raw materials. However, some individual units attributed the failure to objective difficulties, such as emphasizing poor coal quality, insufficient equipment, and a lack of technical personnel. The meeting was summarized by Wang Heshou, Minister of Industry, who pointed out: The fact that some production tasks were not completed in January shows that our work in various aspects has not been done well. If this situation is not changed, it will affect the completion of the annual plan, which is a very serious matter. He pointed out: The proactive way to improve future work is to clearly establish the following concept among all personnel in the enterprise departments: completing the state's plan is a discipline we must abide by, and we must abide by it as we abide by laws and regulations. We should thoroughly transform the rural work style and fight against the undisciplined thinking of not following plans. The method of making plans according to spring, summer, autumn, and winter in rural areas should be changed to making plans every month, every ten days, and every day. Minister Wang emphasized that enterprise management personnel should strive to complete the plan in the struggle to overcome difficulties; it is wrong to attribute the failure to complete the plan to objective reasons without actively seeking ways to overcome difficulties. In addition to stipulating the establishment of a responsibility system and a strict inspection system in the summary, the responsible persons of each bureau and company were also instructed to investigate the factories and mines that did not complete the January plan and formulate specific plans for improvement. Finally, Chairman Gao Gang spoke, saying: The production plan approved by the government must be completed. Units that successfully complete their tasks should be commended, and those that do not complete their tasks should be criticized. He called on everyone to overcome difficulties and oppose bowing their heads in the face of difficulties.

　　东北检查一月份生产会议上
    高岗主席着重号召  克服困难完成计划
    【新华社沈阳二十三日电】东北人民政府工业部于本月四日召开扩大部务会议，检查各单位完成一月份生产计划的情况。东北人民政府高岗主席亦出席指导。会上批评了未完成计划的单位，并明确提出，要树立坚决遵守和完成计划的观念，与不照计划办事的农村散漫作风作斗争。据工业部计划处副处长在会上报告，在各厂、矿产品月报中的三十三种重要产品中，完成与超过计划的产品有煤、铜、铅、水泥、棉布、棉纱等十九种，各完成计划百分之一百零八至一百五十四。未完成计划的产品十四种，其中如铁矿石仅完成百分之八十七，生铁百分之九十六点七，焦炭百分之八十九；完成计划最低的产品如自行车、三角带等，仅达计划产量的百分之五十左右。各未完成计划的局、公司负责人员曾在会中进行了自我检讨。大多认为一月份计划未完成的主要原因是：生产组织不健全，执行劳动纪律不严格，缺乏严格检查与机械检修制，原材料供应不及时等。但也有个别单位推诿于客观困难，如强调煤质不好，设备不够，缺乏技术人员等。会议由工业部长王鹤寿进行总结，他指出：一月份的某些生产任务未完成的事实，说明了我们各方面工作还没做好。如不改变这种情况，将影响全年计划的完成，这是一件极为严重的大事。他指出：改善今后工作的积极办法，首先要在企业部门的所有人员中明确地树立起这样的观念：完成国家的计划是我们必须遵守的纪律，我们必须像遵守法规一样地遵守它。我们应该彻底转变农村作风，并向散漫不照计划办事的思想进行斗争。要把农村中按春夏秋冬订计划的方法，改变为每月每旬每日订计划。王部长强调指出企业管理人员要在克服困难的斗争中来争取完成计划；不积极设法克服困难而把计划未完成推之于客观原因是错误的。总结中除对树立负责制和严格的检查制度等有所规定外，并责成各局、公司的负责人员对一月份未完成计划的厂矿加以调查，做出改进的具体方案。最后由高岗主席讲话，他说：经政府批准的生产计划是一定要完成的，胜利完成任务的单位应受到表扬，没有完成任务的应受到批评。他号召大家要克服困难，反对在困难面前低头。
