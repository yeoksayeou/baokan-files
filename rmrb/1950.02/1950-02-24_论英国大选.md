An article by Gallagher, translated by Fu Yingjie

This is an essay published by Comrade Gallagher, a Member of Parliament for the British Communist Party, in the November issue of "Labour Monthly" last year. It proves that the Labour Party and the Conservative Party agree on important issues, and the election competition is a deception.
——Editor

The 1950 general election will be the most deceptive election for the British people. The earlier sham election battle between the Liberal Party and the Conservative Party can be regarded as a serious war compared to the "battle" that the Labour Party and the Conservative Party are about to play. While the Labour Party and the Conservative Party are engaging in this fake "battle" with great seriousness, they agree on all major issues. They are united on all important matters, such as surrendering to the United States, anti-Soviet and anti-Eastern European war groups, the so-called Western Alliance, the exploitation of colonial peoples by American monopoly capital, wage freezes, important cuts, and devaluation of the pound. Undoubtedly, the Labour government has done a great service to the British and American capitalist classes. No other government could have divided the workers as much as the Labour government did.

However, for the American masters, the period during which the Labour government could be used has now passed. The American masters no longer need the Labour government. But they do not want a Conservative government either, because they know that an openly Conservative government would not be very capable of controlling the workers. What they want is a government of national unity; and what they want, they will surely get. They want such a government that can ruthlessly lower the living standards of the working class, but because Labour Party and trade union leaders remain in the government, it still has enough influence to undermine and weaken the power of the trade unions, thus preventing workers from rising up to make any real resistance to the deteriorating living conditions.

Labour leaders realize that this development is inevitable. The question turning in their minds is only how to make it happen while at the same time ensuring that most of their own power remains intact. Should a government of national unity be proposed before the general election? Or should a government of national unity be organized after the general election? The Labour Party decided to take the latter approach.

Therefore, Bevan attacked the Conservative Churchill in the parliamentary debate on the devaluation of the pound. Bevan used all the deceptive methods to create the impression that there were issues worth fighting for. Are there really? Take a look at the motions in Parliament. The motion supporting the government was: "This House supports the decisions taken in Washington," so on and so forth, "confidence in the government." The Conservative amendment was: "This House, while agreeing with the decisions taken in Washington," so on and so forth, "no confidence in the government." So, they agree in principle, or rather, there are no principles, and the election will compete on minor details of "so on and so forth." Bevan's speech in the debate on the devaluation of the pound fully expressed this spirit. He began by citing a batch of "facts" to refute Churchill's attacks on the government. He wanted to prove that Churchill was wrong—he proved too much. Churchill declared that the government had wasted "our country's resources" and that our country was in a worse position than any of our allies in the "Western European Alliance." Bevan disagreed. He had "facts" to prove that although our country's situation was bad, it was not as bad as other countries. Their situation was worse than Britain's. They are all going from bad to worse, and deteriorating more rapidly than Britain's deterioration. What a confession! Every country that has received "aid" from the Marshall Plan has plummeted toward national bankruptcy; and our only consolation is—according to Bevan—that other countries are deteriorating even worse than us.

Once someone asked me if I opposed accepting American aid given our country's difficulties after the war. I replied that if aid was necessary and if giving aid was open and sincere, I would not oppose accepting it. If I were about to drown in the deep sea, I would be grateful to someone who threw me a life preserver; but if someone threw me a piece of lead and deceived me by saying that this piece of lead would keep me afloat, I would say different things to him.

Bevan's policy is to attack Churchill; but this does not help the poor Labour Party members on the most important issue of the devaluation of the pound.

He said that the Labour government wanted to maintain full employment, however, how the devaluation of the pound would help maintain full employment was not explained at all. Every Labour MP in Parliament agreed with what Cripps said in July, that the devaluation of the pound would be a great disaster. Even on the Sunday that the devaluation of the pound was announced, the "Sunday Pictorial" published Crossman's weekly essay, proving that the devaluation of the pound would undoubtedly be detrimental to the British people.

Who wanted the devaluation of the pound? Not the Labour Party, nor the Trades Union Congress. No. The United States wanted the devaluation of the pound and forced the British Cabinet to do so.

Since the British Cabinet was forced to accept the measure of devaluation of the pound, it had to find some explanation to explain why it took such an ugly tumble. The Labour Party's poor MPs had to find some words to say. The so-called "brains" racked their brains and invented a statement that the devaluation of the pound was the only way to avoid mass unemployment. The "brains" told this statement to the politically bankrupt MPs, and the MPs (including Crossman) immediately seized on this statement and engaged in spreading this claim in Parliament and in newspapers.

How do you say it? According to Cripps' opinion, our country's resources are flowing out so quickly that we can no longer afford the necessary imports. If we cut these imports, our industry will lack raw materials, and we will have to shorten working hours or shut down completely. To avoid that situation, we devalue the pound, therefore, we have to pay more pounds for our imports. What a remedy! We can't afford 300 million pounds, so our way to solve this problem is to pay 390 million pounds for the same goods. How absurd, almost unbelievable. But "we hope" exports will greatly increase. There is no "hope" for imports. We have to pay more money for imports, there is no way out. These are the "facts" that Bevan calls them. It is certain. Our imports will cost us more. How will this stop unemployment? Not even Cripps attempted to explain this mystery. As for exports, even if we expanded them by half, it would only offset the losses we suffered due to paying higher prices for imports and the reduction in the prices of our exports.

However, if this argument is not well made, they have another more plausible argument to use. It was put together very well and presented at the Labour Party meeting in Parliament. "The devaluation of the pound is an expedient measure to help us get through temporary difficulties, after which we will move towards economic stability and new prosperity." These people are "planners." What kind of miracles will they create with "planning"! They are all talking about it. They are talking about "planning" as they talk about the devaluation of the pound as an expedient measure. What they mean by expedient measure is that this action does not involve policy or principle. This is abandoning planning. This makes planning impossible.

Take a look at the past. After the surge in prices in the United States at the end of 1946, the then Chancellor of the Exchequer Dalton came to the House of Commons around Easter 1947, wailing that we could not fulfill the dollar obligations we had promised to the United States. Did he have any policies, any plans, to save us from the rapidly approaching crisis? No. He had an expedient measure (cutting imports, raising taxes on tobacco and other goods for domestic consumption) to help us get through temporary difficulties. Let us faithfully accept these cuts, let us all cheer up, let us all not take advantage of our compatriots, and as long as we do this, everything will go smoothly. The Labour MPs swallowed it in one gulp. The capacity with which they swallowed the government's sewage was unlimited. A few months later, Dalton reported to us again that the situation was worse. Yes, sir, the situation is worse, not improved. We didn't cheer up enough. So, we have to try again. Further cuts in imports, further cuts in domestic consumption. "Expedient measures to help us get through temporary difficulties."

Dalton resigned, and Cripps came to power amid great cheers from the Conservatives. They really welcomed him. Didn't he declare that he would ruthlessly fight his way out to solve the dollar problem? Where are we now? Is the situation getting better? No, sir, the situation is still getting worse. But he is the person who turns things around. When he gives the order, God's law or the laws of nature are going to yield. Mrs. Partington get out of the way, give the broom to Cripps. Watch him sweep the tide back. He announced in a solemn tone, with a solemn face: important cuts, reducing domestic consumption, workers have to work harder. This time, if we all really cheer up and behave like Christians, then we will definitely overcome all difficulties, see the light again, and live happily.

Did the Labour MPs ever rise up to protest loudly? Did they ever ask the government to have such a policy, a plan, that clearly pointed out the way to escape panic and achieve socialist goals? Stupid questions, brothers, stupid questions. The Labour MPs have no say in decision-making. As one Labour MP said to me one day, "I sat on the train with Pollitt, and I told him that many of us agree with his opinion, but we dare not speak out. We are intimidated." They have never been consulted. A decision is made, and then they are told that if anyone dares to try to overturn the decision, they will suffer.

We have to have important cuts and so on, and, I almost forgot, we also got a new expedient measure from this freezing Chancellor of the Exchequer (if we believe the Conservatives, it is the best expedient measure), which is "wage freeze." But, heavens, we don't behave like Christians, we didn't cheer up, we didn't work hard enough, or it's blamed on the hateful communists. Whatever the reason, our situation has not improved, we continue to go from bad to worse, so we have to try again "expedient measures to help us get through temporary difficulties," which is the simple explanation of why we devalued the pound.

This is a most outstanding "plan." If you still doubt it, you can ask a Labour MP, and he will tell you everything. But don't ask Bevan. He is too busy thinking about how to campaign, campaigning with Churchill as the central figure, and has no energy to think about such trivial matters as the devaluation of the pound and lowering the people's living standards. Churchill and Bevan, these two clowns playing doddering old men, guarantee that your mind will no longer think about empty food shelves, or even empty stomachs.

But what appears before the people is not only these two clowns playing doddering old men. There will also be the usual propaganda washing the American and British imperialists, and the slander of the Soviet Union. I saw a Labour Party pamphlet, whose rumors and distortions of facts are unparalleled. It says that the United States is a peace-loving country; and that the Soviet Union is a threat to peace. For those who once claimed to respect the red flag and advocate socialism, this is such a shameful betrayal! They tell us that the Soviet Union "organized civil wars in Greece, China, Burma, Indonesia, and Malaya." There is simply no such thing as lying like this, so completely contrary to the facts! In Greece, it is British troops, Anglo-American money and equipment; in China, it is American money and equipment; in Malaya, it is British troops protecting the interests of tin and rubber monopoly capital; in Indonesia, it is Dutch troops suppressing the people's struggle for independence. They have the audacity to say that the Soviet Union is responsible for the results of imperialist rule.

This pamphlet's attempt to poison the people's minds does not stop there. It even says, "The United States wants to hand over the atomic bomb to a world control organization. All countries welcome this proposal, but the Soviet Union used its veto to reject this proposal." Let's think about it. I know that many Labour Party leaders are very stupid. Many of them are hypnotized by their own propaganda, and they believe in whatever is beneficial to the United States and detrimental to the Soviet Union. But no one is really so stupid as to believe that the United States really wants to give up its atomic bomb. The United States is unwilling to tell Britain about the atomic bomb, even though Britain sent scientists to the United States to help them make the atomic bomb. Anyone who says that the United States is going to give up the atomic bomb has been deceived by his own propaganda.

All of this will appear in the British general election, coupled with two clowns playing doddering old men and the ideological confusion about the devaluation of the pound, will not promote revolution, but rather forces that confuse and hinder progress. We must fight against this nonsense propaganda spread from platforms, newspapers, and radios. But the forces of peace and progress are growing stronger. We will engage in battle with full confidence. We will surely win in the end.

　　论英国大选
    加拉赫著  福英节译
    这是英共的下院议员加拉赫同志在去年十一月份《劳动月刊》所发表的论文，证明工党与保守党在重要问题上是意见相同，选举竞争是一骗局。
    ——编者
    一九五○年的大选，将为对英国人民欺骗最甚的一次选举。早时的自由党对保守党的装模作样的选举战，比起工党与保守党行将扮演的“战斗”来，却可以算是严重的战争了。工党与保守党之间正在像煞有介事地进行这种假“战斗”时，他们对于一切重大问题却意见一致。他们对于所有的重要的事情，如向美国屈服、反苏联反东欧的战争集团、所谓西方联盟、美国独占资本对殖民地人民之剥削、工资冻结、重要的削减、金镑贬值，却全都联合一致。无疑问地，工党政府为英国和美国的资本阶级已尽了很大的效劳。没有另一个政府能够像工党政府那样做到了分裂工人。
    可是，对于美国主子们说来，工党政府可供利用的时期现已过去了。美国主子们已再用不着工党政府了。但他们也不要保守党政府，因为他们知道公开的保守党政府不很能够控制得住工人。他们所欲的是举国一致的政府；而他们所欲的，他们一定可得到。他们欲有这样的一个政府，它既能无情地压低劳动阶级的生活程度，但由于政府中留有工党和职工会的头目们，它仍然具有足够的影响来破坏和削弱职工会的力量，因而能够阻止工人们对日益恶化的生活条件起来作任何真正的反抗。
    工党头目们认识到这一发展是不能避免的。他们的脑子所转的问题，只是如何使其实现而同时又使他们自己的力量大部分不受损。在大选之前提出举国一致的政府呢？还是大选之后才组织举国一致的政府呢？工党决定了采取后者。
    因此，比万在国会辩论金镑贬值时，对保守党邱吉尔加以攻击。比万用一切的欺骗民众的手法来造成一种印象，即，有值得斗争的问题。真是有吗？看一看国会中的动议吧。拥护政府的动议是：“本院支持在华盛顿所采取的决定，”如此这般，“对政府信任”。保守党的修正案是：“本院虽然赞同在华盛顿所采取的决定，”如此这般，“对政府不信任”。所以，他们在原则上是意见一致的，或者说，没有原则，大选将在“如此这般”的小微末节上进行竞争。比万在辩论金镑贬值的讲话中，就充分表示这种精神。他一开始就举出一批“事实”来否证邱吉尔对政府的攻击。他要证明邱吉尔是错了——他证明太多。邱吉尔宣称，政府浪费了“我国的资源”，我国所处的地位比“西欧联盟”中我们的任何一个联盟国还要坏。比万不同意这个意见。他有“事实”证明我国处境虽然是坏，但并不像别国那样坏。它们的境况比英国更不如。它们全都是每况愈下，而且恶化得比英国的日益恶化还要迅速。何等样的自供呵！每一个从马歇尔计划获得“援助”的国家都一落千丈，趋向着全国破产；而我们的唯一的安慰是——据比万所说——别国境况比我国恶化得更甚。
    有一次有人问我，我国战后有这些困难，我是否反对接受美国的援助。我回答说，如果援助是必需的，而且给予援助是公开的和真诚的，我并不反对接受援助。如果我在深海中行将没顶，若有人抛一救生圈给我，我自当感谢他；但若有人抛一块铅给我，并且欺弄我说这块铅会使我浮于水面，我对他就会讲不同的话了。
    比万的政策是攻击邱吉尔；但这在最主要的金镑贬值问题上，对可怜的工党党员并没有什么帮助。
    他说工党政府要保持充分就业，然而，金镑贬值如何有助于保持充分就业，则完全没有解释。国会中的每一位工党议员都同意克里浦斯在七月所说的话，金镑贬价将为一个大灾害。甚至在宣布金镑贬值的那一个星期日，《星期画报》还登载克洛斯曼的每周论文，证明了金镑贬值毫无疑问地将不利于英国人民。
    谁欲金镑贬值？不是工党，也不是职工会大会。不。美国欲金镑贬值，而强迫英国内阁这样做。
    英国内阁既被迫而接受金镑贬值之措施，乃不得不找寻某种说明来解释为什么要翻这样丑的一个筋斗。工党的怪可怜的议员们要找些话来说。所谓“智囊们”绞尽脑汁，发明了一种说法，说如果要避免大批失业就只好金镑贬值。“智囊们”把这种说法告诉政治破产了的议员们，议员们（包括克洛斯曼在内）立即抓住这种说法，而在议会中和在报纸上从事散布此种主张了。
    怎样讲法呢？据克里浦斯的意见，我国的资源是流出这么快，我们已不能再偿付必需的输入品了。如果我们削减这些输入，我国工业将缺少原料，就将不得不缩短开工时间或完全关厂。要避免那种情况，我们把金镑贬值，因此，对我们的输入品要偿付更多的金镑。这是何等样的补救方法！我们付不起三亿金镑，所以，我们解决此问题的方法，是对同样的货物付出三亿九千万金镑。这是何等的荒唐，几乎令人不能置信。但是，“我们希望”输出会大为增加。对输入已没有“希望”。我们对输入品要付更多的钱，没有什么出路。这就是比万称为“事实”。这是一定的。我们的输入将叫我们付更多的代价。这将如何阻止失业呢？对此一神秘，连克里浦斯也没有企图解释。至于输出，就使我们扩大了一半，也仅仅抵消我们由于对输入品付更高的代价和我们的输出品价格降低所遭受的损失。
    可是，如果这种论据讲得不太好，他们还有另一种更似是而非的论据可用。拼拼凑凑得很好，在国会的工党会议上提出来。“金镑贬值是一权宜之计，用来使我们渡过暂时的困难，过后我们就将向经济稳定与新的繁荣前进。”这群人物是“计划家”。他们将用“计划”来造出何等的奇迹呀！他们都在谈着。他们在谈“计划”如他们在谈金镑贬值为一权宜之计然。他们所说的权宜之计，其意思是说此一行动不涉及政策或原则。这是放弃计划。这使计划成为不可能。
    看一看经过吧。美国在一九四六年末物价暴涨之后，当时的财政大臣道尔顿在一九四七年耶稣复活节左右到下议院来，恸哭我们不能履行答应了美国的美元义务。他有任何政策，任何计划，以挽救我们脱出迅速来临的危机吗？没有。他有一权宜之计（削减输入、对烟草及其他供本国消费的物品征税提高）使我们渡过暂时的困难。让我们忠心地接受这些削减吧，让我们都振作起来吧，让我们都不要占同胞的便宜吧，只要这样，一切就将顺利了。工党国会议员们把它一口气吞进去了。他们把政府的污水狂吞进去的容量是无限的。几个月之后，道尔顿又向我们报告说，情况更坏了。是的，先生，情况是更坏，不是改善。我们振作得不够。所以，我们一定要再试一下。输入再削减，本国消费再削减。“权宜之计，来使我们渡过暂时的困难”。
    道尔顿去职，在保守党大欢呼中克里浦斯上台。他们真真欢迎他。他不是声明他将无情地打出一条出路来解决美元难题吗？我们现在怎样啦？情况日佳吗？不，先生，仍然是情况日劣。但他是扭转形势的人呀。当他发令的时候，上帝的法则或自然的法则是要屈服的呀。巴丁顿夫人滚开吧，把扫帚给克里浦斯。看着他把潮水扫回去吧。他用庄严的声调，庄严的容貌，宣布着：重要的削减，剥减本国的消费，工人要更吃力工作。这一次，如果我们全都真正振作起来，行为得像基督徒，那么，我们就一定会克服一切的困难，重见光明，过着快活的日子。
    工党议员曾经起来大声抗议吗？他们曾经要求政府要有这样的一个政策，一个计划，明白地指出逃脱恐慌的道路而达到社会主义目标吗？愚蠢的问题，兄弟们，愚蠢的问题。工党国会议员们对于决策是没有发言权。正如有一位工党国会议员有一天对我说，“我与波立特同坐火车，我告诉他，我们之中有许多人是同意他的意见，但我们不敢开口。我们被恐吓。”从来没有向他们征求过意见。做了决定，然后告诉他们，如有敢企图推翻该决定的，就要吃苦头。
    我们要有重要的削减等等，而且，我几乎忘记了，我们还从这个冻结财政大臣得到一个新的权宜之计，（如果我们相信保守党的话，是最好的权宜之计，）即“工资冻结。”但是，天呀，我们行为并不像基督徒，我们没有振作起来，我们没有工作得够卖力，或者是归咎于可恶的共产党人。不管是什么原因，我们的情况并没有改善，我们继续每况愈下，所以，我们只好再试试“权宜之计来使我们渡过暂时的困难，”这就是我们为何采取金镑贬值之简单解释。
    这是一最杰出的“计划”。如果你还怀疑，可以问一问工党议员，他会告诉你一切。但你不要问比万。他太忙于思索如何进行竞选，以邱吉尔为中心人物来进行竞选，没有精神来想如像金镑贬值和削低人民生活程度这样的琐事。邱吉尔与比万这两位扮演龙钟老汉的丑角保证使你们的脑子不再想及空空如也的食物架子，甚至不想及空空如也的肚子。
    但是在人民面前出现的，不仅是这两位扮演龙钟老汉的丑角。也将照例有代美英帝国主义洗刷的宣传，并对苏联的诬蔑。我看到了工党的一本小册子，其造谣诬蔑和歪曲事实是无比的。说美国是爱和平的国家；说苏联是危害和平。对于那些一度曾经宣称尊敬红旗和主张社会主义的人们，这是何等可耻的变节！他们告诉我们说，苏联“在希腊、中国、缅甸、印尼、和马来组织内战。”像这样说谎，这样完全不合事实的，简直就没有！在希腊，是英国的军队，英美的金钱和装备；在中国是美国的金钱和装备；在马来是英国的军队保护着锡和橡皮独占资本的利益；在印尼是荷兰的军队镇压人民的独立斗争。他们却这样厚脸皮地说苏联要对帝国主义统治的结果负责。
    这小册子之企图毒害人民的思想，并不止于此。甚至说，“美国要把原子弹交给一个世界管制机构，各国都欢迎这一建议，苏联则使用其否决权，否决此一建议。”我们想一想吧。我知道工党领导人物有许多是很愚蠢的。有许多人是被他们自己的宣传所催眠了，不论什么东西，只要对美国有利、对苏联不利的，他们都信以为真。但没有人确是这么愚蠢到相信美国真要放弃其原子弹。美国不愿意把原子弹告诉英国，虽然英国派了科学家到美国去帮他们制造原子弹。说美国要放弃原子弹的人，是被他自己的宣传所骗了。
    这一切都将在英国大选中出现，再加上两位扮演龙钟老汉的丑角以及对于金镑贬值的思想混乱，并不会促进革命，而是混乱和阻碍进步的力量。我们要向这种在讲台、报纸和无线电上散布的胡说八道的宣传进行斗争。但和平与进步的力量日益加强。我们将充满着信心地从事战斗。我们最后一定得到胜利。
