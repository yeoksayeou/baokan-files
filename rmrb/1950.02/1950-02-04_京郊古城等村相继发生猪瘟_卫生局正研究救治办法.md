Swine Fever Occurs Successively in Ancient City and Other Villages in the Suburbs of Beijing
　　Health Bureau is Studying Treatment Methods
　　[Reported by this newspaper] Severe swine fever has occurred successively in districts 16, 19, and 20 in the suburbs of Beijing. In Gucheng Village, District 19 (Shijingshan), of the more than 210 pigs raised, 34 died of disease within a month, and the masses slaughtered 33 diseased pigs. There are still 21 pigs currently infected. The symptoms are: red and white spots on the body, some also have diarrhea, and generally die after being sick for ten days or so. The intestines of the slaughtered diseased pigs are black, and some lungs and livers are rotten. In Gaojing Village, 70 out of 110 pigs died within a month. Swine fever has occurred in eight villages in the district. It was also discovered at the same time in District 20 (Mentougou). The condition is more severe in Shihe Village, where more than 20 pigs have died in three or four days. In some villages in District 16 (Xiyuan), pigs began dying as early as last June. The situation was severe in June and July. Although it improved later, it never stopped completely. In December of last year, large numbers of pigs began dying again. Over the past six months, swine fever has occurred in thirteen villages. More than 200 pigs died in Bagou Village, and more than 100 died in Wanshou Temple Village. Because pigs are constantly dying from the plague, farmers dare not buy or feed them anymore, so very few villages are still raising pigs.
　　The Suburban Work Committee of the Beijing Municipal People's Government discussed the swine fever occurring in various districts at the production meeting held in the middle of last month and decided that Dr. Li Jianshi of the Municipal Public Health Bureau would be responsible for organizing manpower and material resources to carry out medical treatment and prevention. After Dr. Li consulted with the Ministry of Agriculture of the Central People's Government and the Department of Animal Disease Prevention of the North China Agricultural Science Research Institute, it was determined that the cost price of the swine fever prevention serum currently produced by the institute is relatively high. Injecting one pig requires an average of sixty catties of millet (approximately equal to half the price of a pig), making it difficult to use in large quantities in rural areas. At the same time, the Veterinary Department of the Municipal Public Health Bureau has few personnel (six veterinarians) and needs to work in various slaughterhouses in the city, so it cannot spare personnel to work in the rural areas of the suburbs. Dr. Li Jianshi of the Veterinary Department of the Municipal Health Bureau is now preparing to further discuss with relevant parties, study methods, organize manpower and material resources, and find ways to carry out medical treatment. Pig raising is a very important aspect of farmers' sideline production. It is hoped that relevant parties will pay sufficient attention to this so that swine fever in the suburbs can be effectively treated and prevented from continuing to develop.

　　京郊古城等村相继发生猪瘟
    卫生局正研究救治办法
    【本报讯】北京京郊十六、十九、二十等各区相继发生严重的猪瘟。十九区（石景山）古城村共养猪二百一十多口，一个月内病死三十四口，群众杀病猪三十三口，现染病的还有二十一口。病状是：身上有红白点，有的还拉稀屎，一般病十几天即死。杀死的病猪肠子发黑，有的肺、肝已烂。高井村一百一十口猪，一个月内死了七十口。该区发生猪瘟的已有八个村。二十区（门头沟）亦同时发现，较严重的石?村三、四天内已死二十多口。十六区（西苑）有些村自去年六月即开始死猪，六、七月严重，以后虽较好，但一直未断，至去年十二月又开始大量死猪。半年以来发生猪瘟的有十三个村。巴沟村死猪二百口以上，万寿寺村死一百多口。因为猪不断遭瘟死亡，农民不敢再买、再喂，所以有些村已经很少养猪了。
    北京市人民政府郊区工作委员会对各区发生的猪瘟，曾在上月中旬召开的生产会议中进行讨论，决定由本市公共卫生局李建时医生负责，组织人力、物力，进行医疗和防止。经李医生向中央人民政府农业部及其所属华北农业科学研究所家畜防疫系商讨结果，因该所现制之猪瘟防疫血清成本价格较高，注射一口猪平均需六十斤小米（约等于半个猪的价钱），难以在农村大量使用。同时，本市公共卫生局兽医科因人员较少（六个兽医），需要在市内各屠宰场进行工作，亦未能抽派人到郊区各农村进行工作。现市卫生局兽医科李建时医生准备进一步和有关各方面进行商讨，研究办法，筹组人力、物力，设法进行医治。养猪是农民副业生产极重要的一项，希望有关方面对此予以足够重视，使郊区的猪瘟能得到有效的医治和防止其继续发展。
