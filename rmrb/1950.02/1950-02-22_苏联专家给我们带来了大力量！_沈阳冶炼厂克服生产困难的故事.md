Soviet Experts Have Brought Us Great Strength!
    ——The Story of Shenyang Smelter Overcoming Production Difficulties
    After resuming production in January of last year, the Shenyang Smelter immediately faced a problem that urgently needed to be solved – a lack of raw materials (usable copper ore). If this difficulty could not be resolved, the arrival of a forced shutdown crisis would be unavoidable. The reason why the plant's raw material supply became a problem was that its several main copper mines had been destroyed by the enemy and puppets by more than 80 percent, making it extremely difficult to recover in the short term. The quality of the few mines that had been restored was also very low (containing too much lead), making it impossible to refine copper with the original technical level. The limited amount of usable ore accumulated in the factory was decreasing day by day.
    In the late autumn of last year, the available stock of materials in the factory was about to run out! However, poor ore with a lead content of more than 6 percent, which had been regarded as waste during the enemy-puppet period, had accumulated like a mountain due to years of abandonment. At that time, the workers actively proposed to try smelting poor ore and asked the engineers for advice. The engineers replied that if the ore contained too much lead, the lead would not oxidize during smelting, and no copper could be refined. Most of the workers and management personnel were inevitably conquered by the facts of the enemy-puppet period and the engineers' replies, which reduced their confidence and increased their worries. However, a few advanced workers refused to be daunted and continued to engage in research actively. They increased the blowing pressure of the blast furnace and finally extracted copper from copper ore with a lead content of about 7 percent, breaking the Japanese smelting technology's conventions for the first time. However, most of the ore with a lead content of more than 8 percent could not be processed, so the serious threat of shutdown still existed. At this time, a Soviet expert was assigned by the Northeast People's Government to the factory to help improve production technology. After understanding these circumstances, he first affirmed that the method of increasing air pressure was correct. He then proposed improved methods for adjusting equipment, batching materials, and placing coke, in light of the actual situation. When these suggestions were approved by the factory's administrative department and began to be implemented, he began to provide specific guidance to the workers on-site, step by step, and finally successfully refined copper ore with a lead content of 8 percent to 14 percent, solving the serious difficulty of the factory's inability to refine low-grade ore, which led to a lack of raw materials.
    The Bessemer converter, an important part of the plant's production process, has always been built with yellow soil. It must be repaired once every one or two days of operation, and each repair generally takes twelve hours. Therefore, production must be interrupted, which affects the improvement of output. When technician Zhao Qiming and worker Chen Liangao suggested using higher-grade refractory magnesium bricks to build the furnace, they were also opposed by some technicians. Later, with the support of the administrative leaders, a magnesium brick furnace was made in October of last year according to their opinions for trial smelting. Facts have proved that the new furnace increased the actual recovery rate of copper by one-third and greatly reduced the consumption of fuel oil. However, a new problem arose – how long could the magnesium brick furnace be used? At least seven days are required for a repair, and the cost is high. If it cannot be used for a long time, it would be more cost-effective to use a yellow soil furnace. Therefore, the factory did not dare to start building a second magnesium brick furnace. When the Soviet expert saw this creation of the workers, he praised it repeatedly and confidently judged that the new furnace could be used for half a year. Then, after pointing out that the disadvantage of the magnesium brick furnace was its small volume, he helped the workers calculate the specific gravity of the copper juice and the compressive strength of the magnesium bricks, and redesigned a larger furnace sample, so that the output of blister copper could be increased by 80 percent each time. When building the magnesium brick furnace, he saw that the workers spent a lot of time cutting and grinding more than a dozen different shapes of round bricks and felt that it was a waste. Therefore, he suggested that the round furnace be changed to a square furnace when building the third new furnace. After his repeated explanations, some workers' concerns that the pressure inside the square furnace might be uneven and therefore dangerous were eliminated. As a result of adopting the Soviet expert's suggestion, labor was saved by two-thirds, and the situation was very good.
    According to the pseudo-Manchu operating procedures, when the blister copper juice flows out of the Bessemer converter into the mold, yellow mud must always be used to facilitate removal after condensation. During blister copper electrolysis, the yellow soil substance brought with it settles in the electrolyte solution, greatly weakening the current efficiency. After discovering this unscientific operation method, the Soviet expert designed a special tool to prevent the blister copper from carrying soil, correcting the unreasonable phenomenon of wasting current in the past.
    Thanks to the enthusiasm and creativity of the employees and the technical assistance of the Soviet experts, the Shenyang Smelter, which often failed to complete its production tasks in the past, exceeded its copper production plan by 23 percent in January of this year. The quality of blister copper has also improved. In the same month, lead production exceeded the production plan by 54 percent. Therefore, the factory was commended by the Industrial Department of the Northeast People's Government.
    Soviet experts are so sincere and responsible in imparting advanced experience and technology, and so modest and simple in their work attitude and lifestyle, that they quickly established a deep friendship with the workers. The factory's employees often say to others in unison: "Since the Soviet comrades came, we have gained great courage and strength."

### 苏联专家给我们带来了大力量！——沈阳冶炼厂克服生产困难的故事

　　苏联专家给我们带来了大力量！
    ——沈阳冶炼厂克服生产困难的故事
    沈阳冶炼厂于去年一月恢复生产后即面对着一个极需解决的问题——原料（可用的铜矿石）的缺乏；这个困难如果不能解决，那么，被迫停工危机的到来是无法避免的。该厂原料供给方面之所以成为问题，是由于它的几个主要铜矿山已被敌伪破坏了百分之八十以上，短期内绝难恢复；少数已恢复的矿山的品质又甚低（含铅成分太多），以原有的技术水平不能炼出铜来；而厂内积存的有限的可用矿石，却正一天一天不断地在减少下去。
    去年深秋，厂内的可用存料将要用完了！但在敌伪时期被视为废品的、含铅在百分之六以上的贫矿石，由于历年的遗弃业已堆积如山。当时工人便积极提议试炼贫矿石并向工程师请教；工程师的回答是：矿石含铅多了冶炼时铅质不能氧化，炼不出铜来。大多数工人和管理人员便不免被敌伪的事实和工程师的答复所征服，减低了信心，增加了忧虑；可是少数的先进工人却不肯畏难而退，依然很积极地继续从事研究。他们提高了鼓风炉的送风压力，终于从含铅在百分之七左右的铜矿石中提炼出铜质来，第一次打破了日本冶炼技术上的陈规。但是对于大部分含铅在百分之八以上的矿石还是无法处理，所以停工的严重威胁依旧存在。这时，恰巧有一位苏联专家被东北人民政府分配到该厂来帮助改进生产技术工作。他一了解这些情况后，便首先肯定提高风压的操作方法是正确的；并配合实际情形拟出了调整设备、配料、放置焦炭的改进办法。当这些建议经该厂行政部门批准而开始执行时，他就开始一步不离地在现场具体指导工人操作，终于很顺利地使含铅百分之八以至于百分之十四的铜矿石的提炼获得成功；解决了该厂无法提炼低级矿石而形成原料缺乏的大严重困难。
    作为该厂生产过程中重要部分之一的真吹炉，历来均用黄土筑成；操作一、两天就要修筑一次，修一次的时间一般需要十二小时。因此生产必须间断，影响产量的提高。当技术员赵启明、工人陈连高建议改用较高级的耐火材料镁砖筑炉时，也同样地受到有些技术人员的反对。后来由于行政领导者的支持乃于去年十月间按他们的意见制成镁砖炉进行试炼。事实证明：新炉使铜的实收率增加了三分之一，并大大减少了燃料重油的消耗。然而这儿又发生了一个新的问题——镁砖炉究竟能用到多久呢？一修筑起码要七天，成本又高，如果不能久用的话，则还不如用黄土炉子合算；所以该厂不敢动工建筑第二个镁砖炉。苏联专家一看到这个工人们的创造后就连连称赞，并肯定地判断说：新炉可用半年。接着，他在指出了镁砖炉的缺点是容积不大后就帮助工人计算铜汁的比重、镁砖的耐压力，从新设计了一个较大的炉样；使粗铜产量每次都可增加百分之八十。在建筑镁砖炉的时候，他看到工人们为砍磨十几种不同形状的圆形砖所化的时间很多，觉得是一种浪费。因而他提出建议在建第三个新炉子时将圆形炉改成方形炉。经过他的反复说明，有些工人认为方形炉内压力不均因而可能发生危险的顾虑才告消除。由于采纳了苏联专家建议的结果，人工节省了三分之二，情况亦甚为良好。
    按照伪满的操作规程：当粗铜汁流出真吹炉入模型时，为了便于凝结后易于拿出，总要使用黄土泥。在粗铜电解时，所带的黄土质便沉淀于电解溶液内，大大减弱了电流效率。苏联专家自发觉这种非科学的操作方法后，即代设计了一种特殊工具，使粗铜不带有泥土，纠正了过去浪费电流的不合理现象。
    由于职工生产积极性、创造性的发挥和苏联专家的技术帮助，过去经常不能完成生产任务的沈阳冶炼厂今年一月份铜的产量超过了生产计划的百分之二十三。粗铜的质量也有提高。同月的铅的产量超过了生产计划的百分之五十四。因此，该厂曾受到东北人民政府工业部的表扬。
    苏联专家在先进的经验和技术的传授上是显得如此的诚恳、负责，在工作态度和生活作风上又表现得那么的谦虚、朴实，因此便很快地和职工群众们建立了深厚的友谊。该厂职工时常异口同声地对旁人说：“自从来了苏联同志，我们就增加了很大的勇气和力量。”
