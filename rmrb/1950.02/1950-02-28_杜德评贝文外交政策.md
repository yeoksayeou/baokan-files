Xinhua News Agency, London, 17th (TASS): In a pamphlet entitled "Mr. Bevin's Record," Du De summarized the consequences of Bevin's diplomatic activities, proving that Bevin's foreign policy is the same as the Conservative Party's foreign policy, which was instructed and approved by Churchill and the Conservative Party. The pamphlet proves that this Conservative foreign policy betrays peace and brings the danger of a new world war closer; aligns Britain with the world's reactionaries to oppose socialism and all peoples; makes Britain a slave to American financiers and warlords; and places a devastating burden on the people, and is the main direct cause of Britain's crisis and economic difficulties.

Du De recalled the promises made by the Labour Party members during the 1945 general election: to resolutely end the Conservative Party's foreign policy aimed at preparing for war, and to pursue a policy of friendship and cooperation with the Soviet Union. Du De pointed out that these promises of the Labour Party have become pure empty words.

Du De went on to point out that Bevin's appointment as Foreign Secretary was with the consent and approval of the Conservative Party and Churchill himself. Bevin repaid the hopes of the Conservative Party with his subsequent activities in this position. In his pamphlet, Du De cited speeches by Conservative Party leaders Churchill, Eden, and Herald Macmillan, who had repeatedly declared in Parliament and in newspapers that they fully endorsed Bevin's foreign policy line.

The author exposed Bevin as a thorough-going imperialist, a supporter and successor of the Conservative Party's policy of ruthlessly exploiting the colonial people and suppressing the colonial people's movements for national independence and democracy.

Du De wrote: In Greece, Bevin used British troops, weapons, and money to maintain the corrupt royalist fascist dictatorship; these dictators had previously supported Hitler and had executed thousands of outstanding Greek democratic fighters, throwing thousands more outstanding Greek democratic fighters into prisons and concentration camps.

Du De pointed out that Bevin's foreign policy, aimed at launching a new world war, is in direct violation of the peace efforts of all peoples. The North Atlantic Treaty Organization war pact signed by Bevin has greatly undermined the United Nations Charter. The North Atlantic Treaty Organization war pact stipulates that each signatory country can take military action without the permission of the United Nations Security Council. Bevin has begun to work with American militarists to undermine the cornerstone of peace and open the door to a new world war. Under the North Atlantic Treaty Organization war pact, the power to decide on war is placed in the hands of a council completely controlled by the United States. As long as the American military authorities indicate, Britain can be dragged into the war.

The aggressive war aims of American militarists and the Anglo-American war bloc are openly declared. This aim is the aim stated in Churchill's Fulton speech. Their entire strategic aim is to prepare for a world war against socialist Soviet Union and the freedom of all peoples. Hundreds of American war bases have been established on every continent thousands of miles from the American coast.

Every peace proposal of the Soviet Union, from the banning of atomic bombs to disarmament, has been opposed and obstructed by the American and British representatives at the United Nations.

The war plan that American strategists have planned for Britain is also openly declared. Britain has been decided to be used as an American atomic bomb base for fighting socialist Europe -- an "unsinkable aircraft carrier," or, as government ministers have called it, the "Malta" of the Third World War. This is the fate that Bevin's policy has prepared for the British people.

Du De further discussed the situation that Britain has fallen into due to Bevin's policy of currying favor with American imperialism. He wrote: "Churchill and Bevin's Anglo-American bloc policy is selling Britain to American financiers and war profiteers. American capitalists are increasingly strangling Britain. Britain has been placed under American domination in economic, political and military aspects. American economic and military controllers have come to Britain. In every matter, the government must "consult" with them. The American controllers report every aspect of British policy to Washington. The devaluation of the pound is enforced by the United States on Britain. Devaluation means that Britain exports more goods to the United States but can only receive fewer dollars than before, while Britain must pay more for all goods imported from the United States. The trade bans imposed on Britain by the United States prevent it from expanding trade with Eastern Europe, so that Britain is artificially suffocated by the dollar deficit and dollar dependence. The British Labour government has consistently obeyed American capitalists and implemented its economic policies. Following American economic domination is the American military occupation. Britain's military equipment and military training are being standardized according to the American system."

The pamphlet concludes with an appeal to voters: "Bevin must step down. Churchill--Bevin's disastrous and war policy must end. We must fight for the only program that can replace it, which is to fight for peace, for British national independence, for the people's living standards, and for the realization of socialist goals. Work to stop the war! Renounce the Atlantic War Pact. Reduce armaments and ban atomic bombs!"

　　杜德评贝文外交政策
    【新华社讯】塔斯社伦敦十七日电：杜德在题为“贝文先生的纪录”的小册子内，总结了贝文外交活动的后果，证明贝文的外交政策，就是保守党的外交政策，这政策是邱吉尔和保守党所授意和嘉许的。小册子证明：这一保守党的外交政策出卖和平，使得新世界战争的危险趋近；使得英国归到全世界反动派的行列里，一同反对社会主义和各族人民；得使英国成为美国金融家和军阀的奴隶；使得人民担负毁灭性的重担，而且是英国的危机和经济困难的主要的直接原因。
    杜德回溯工党分子在一九四五年大选时所作的诺言：坚决终止保守党的旨在准备战争的外交政策，奉行与苏联友好和合作的政策。杜德指出：工党的这些诺言，已成了纯粹的空话。
    杜德继指出，贝文之被任为外相，是得到保守党和邱吉尔本人的同意和嘉许的。而贝文则以他后来担任这一职务中的活动，回报了保守党的希望。杜德在他的小册子里援引保守党领袖邱吉尔、艾登和赫拉德·麦科林的演说，他们曾屡次在议会中和报纸上宣称他们完全嘉许贝文的外交政策路线。
    作者揭露贝文是彻头彻尾的帝国主义者，是保守党政策--无情剥削殖民地人民、镇压殖民地人民争民族独立和民主的运动--的拥护者和继承者。
    杜德写道：在希腊，贝文用英国的军队、武器和金钱维持腐朽的保皇法西斯独裁；这些独裁者以前曾支持过希特勒，并曾处死了成千的优秀希腊民主战士，把另外成千的优秀希腊民主战士，投入监狱和集中营。
    杜德指出，贝文的外交政策，旨在发动新的世界大战，这政策是和所有各族人民的和平努力直接违反的。贝文所签署的北大西洋战争公约，大大地破坏了联合国宪章。北大西洋战争公约规定各签字国无须联合国安全理事会的许可，就可以采取军事行动。贝文已开始和美国军国主义者一起，破坏和平的基石，打开通到新的世界大战的大门。在北大西洋战争公约下，战争的决定权被放到了完全在美国控制下的理事会的手里。只要美国军事当局示意，英国就可以卷入战争。
    美国军国主义分子以及英美战争集团的侵略战争目的，是公开宣明的。这目的就是邱吉尔的富尔敦演说里所说的目的。他们的整个战略目的都在于准备针对社会主义苏联和全世界人民的自由的世界大战。在距离美国海岸数千英里的每一个大陆上，数以百计的美国战争基地已建立了起来。
    苏联的每一个和平建议，从禁止原子弹到裁军，都遭到联合国美英代表的反对和阻梗。
    美国战略家们为英国策划的战争计划，也毫不隐秘地宣告了。英国已被决定了要用来做对社会主义欧洲作战的美国原子弹基地--“不可炸沉的航空母舰”，或者如政府部长们所称：第三次世界大战的“马尔他岛”。这就是贝文的政策，为英国人民准备的命运。
    杜德更进一步讨论了英国由于贝文谄媚美帝国主义的政策而陷入的处境。他写道：“邱吉尔和贝文的英美集团政策，正在将英国出卖给美国金融家和战争贩子。美国资本家对英国是愈来愈扼得紧了。英国已在经济、政治和军事方面被置于美国的支配之下。美国的经济和军事控制者，已来到英国。在每一件事上，政府都要和他们“商量”。美国控制者则将英国政策的每一方面报告华盛顿。英镑贬值系美国强迫英国执行的。贬值的意思就是说，英国向美国输出更多的货物，但只能收入较以前更少的美元，同时英国对一切自美国输入的货物，却必须付出更多的代价。美国指示所加诸英国的贸易禁令，使它不能扩展与东欧的贸易，这样，英国就人为地被美元赤字和美元依赖所窒息。英国工党政府自始至终地听命于美国资本家，执行其经济政策。继美国经济支配之后而来的，是美国的军事占领。英国的军备和军事训练，正在仿照美国的制度予以标准化。”
    该小册子最后向选民发出号召称：“贝文必须下台。邱吉尔--贝文的灾难和战争政策必须终止。我们必需为唯一可以代替它的纲领而奋斗，这纲领就是，争取和平，争取英国民族独立，争取人民的生活水准和争取社会主义目标的实现。努力制止战争！弃绝大西洋战争公约。裁减军备并禁止原子弹！”
