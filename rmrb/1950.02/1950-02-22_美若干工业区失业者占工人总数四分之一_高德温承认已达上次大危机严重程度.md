　　US Several Industrial Areas Have a Quarter of Workers Unemployed
    Goodwin Admits Severity Reached That of Last Great Crisis
    [Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, February 21st] TASS, Washington, February 16th: The Director of the US Labor Department's Employment Service, Goodwin, admitted while testifying before the House Appropriations Committee that the unemployment situation in some areas of the United States has reached the severity of the crisis of 1929-1933. Goodwin said that in some industrial areas, the unemployed account for 25% of the total labor residents. He cited areas suffering from serious unemployment as Rhode Island, the textile centers of the New England states (in northeastern United States), the mining areas of Pennsylvania, and some industrial centers in Michigan, especially Muskegon (in western Michigan). Goodwin said that 25% of the workers in that city are unemployed. Another official of the Labor Department pointed out that unemployed workers in the current 35 industrial centers in the United States account for at least 12% of the total number of workers.
    [Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, February 21st] The unemployment situation in Canada is becoming increasingly serious. According to recent materials from the Canadian Labor Department cited by TASS, the number of registered unemployed in Canada reached 375,000 in early February, an increase of 52,000 in three weeks (according to official figures, there were 260,000 unemployed at the end of January).
    The Labor Department admits that this figure only includes the number of registered unemployed. The number of unemployed in British Columbia reached 68,000. The number of unemployed in the eastern coastal provinces was 55,000, and in Quebec province, it was 109,000. Especially in New Brunswick, the situation of the unemployed is particularly difficult, and there have been cases of many unemployed people starving to death.
    According to a report from the United Press, the actual number of unemployed in Canada is much larger than the figure announced by the Labor Department. The Chairman of the conservative Canadian Labour Congress, Mosher, and the Chairman of the Trades and Labor Congress, Bengough, admitted on the 18th that the unemployment figures released by the government were about 20% lower than the actual situation, because about 20% of the unemployed did not register with the National Employment Service. They pointed out that the number of unemployed has increased by an average of 2,500 per day in the past three weeks.

　　美若干工业区失业者占工人总数四分之一
    高德温承认已达上次大危机严重程度
    【新华社北京二十一日电】塔斯社华盛顿十六日讯：美国劳工部就业局局长高德温顷向众议院拨款委员会作证时承认：美国若干地区失业情形已达到一九二九——一九三三年危机时的严重程度。高德温说：目前，在若干工业区中，失业者占劳动居民总数百分之二十五。他并举出遭受严重失业的区域有罗得岛州、新英格兰诸州（在美国东北部）的纺织业中心，宾夕法尼亚的采矿区，密执安州的某些工业中心，特别是墨斯克冈城（在密执安州西部）。高德温说：该城有百分之二十五工人失业。劳工部的另一位官员曾指出：目前美国三十五个工业中心的失业工人，至少占全部工人数目的百分之十二。
    【新华社北京二十一日电】加拿大失业情况愈益严重。据塔斯社引加拿大劳工部最近的材料，二月初加拿大登记的失业人数达三十七万五千名，在三个星期内增加了五万二千名（按一月底官方承认失业者为二十六万人）。
    劳工部承认这个数字只包括已登记的失业人数。英属哥伦比亚省的失业人数达六万八千名。东部沿海诸省的失业人数为五万五千名，魁北克省为十万零九千名。特别是新不伦瑞克省，失业者的处境尤为困难，现已发生有许多失业者饿死的事件。
    另据合众社消息，加拿大的实际的失业人数，远较劳工部所宣布的数字为大。加保守的劳工大会主席莫薛和职工大会主席班高于十八日承认，政府发表的失业数字比实际情况约少百分之二十，因为约有百分之二十的失业者，并未向国家就业局登记。他们指出，在过去三周之内失业增加的数目，平均每日为二千五百名。
