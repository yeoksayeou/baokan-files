　　A Head-On Blow to the Imperialists
    Enthusiastic Acclaim from All Sectors of the Nation - Supporting the Sino-Soviet Brotherly Alliance
    Li Jishen
    Standing on the position of Sino-Soviet friendship, I give my unreserved approval and support to the signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance, and Mutual Assistance. This good news makes me ecstatic, and I also see the general public beaming with joy, jointly celebrating the success of Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai in signing these treaties and agreements in Moscow. This unprecedented historical development marks the concentrated expression of the friendship between the people of our two great nations, China and the Soviet Union, for more than thirty years since the October Revolution, in the text and spirit of these treaties. It is a brotherly mutual assistance. We can also say that for more than thirty years, due to various facts coupled with these treaties, it has been proven that the Soviet people and the Soviet government's love for the Chinese people has been consistent. Analyzing the content of this treaty, we feel even more the boundless friendship and deep affection of a friendly nation, especially taking into account the interests of the Chinese people today. It has a tremendous impetus for the entire economic development of China. This is something that countries like American imperialism cannot dream of. When they were spreading rumors that the Soviet Union was demanding China to open five ports and monopolizing the Northeast, the broadcast of the completion of the new Sino-Soviet treaty was like a thunderbolt, giving the imperialists a head-on blow! The 1945 Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship and Alliance, signed by the Chiang Kai-shek bandit reactionary regime, was for a term of thirty years. The Soviet Union, based on this treaty, directly sent troops to the Northeast to assist the Chinese people in defeating Japanese imperialism, forcing it to surrender. Now that the Chinese people have established the People's Republic of China, the Soviet Union has re-signed a new treaty with our country. The main task is to resolutely strengthen the friendship and cooperation between the two great nations, China and the Soviet Union, and jointly prevent the resurgence of Japanese imperialism, or the re-aggression of Japan and other countries that collude with Japan in any form of aggression. China and the Soviet Union are also willing to work together to consolidate lasting peace and universal security in the Far East and the world. What a lofty and great task in history! I believe that such progress is enough to guarantee that the international peace and democracy camp will achieve a fundamental and brilliant victory. As for the signing of the $300 million loan agreement, it is especially deeply appreciated by the Chinese people. Because since the Second World War, the Soviet Union's war wounds have not yet fully recovered, but it generously lends us huge sums of money, which is actually helping us, hoping that China's peaceful construction plans will not be affected by the post-war economic destruction, and may quickly embark on the road to industrialization. The Soviet Union's friendly help to us has promoted the progress of China's construction. It should be as Chairman Mao said, "All the friendship of the Soviet Union will never be forgotten by the Chinese people." As a member of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, I express my warm and sincere gratitude to the Soviet friendly country and Marshal Stalin, and wish these treaties and agreements a great contribution to preventing the common enemies of China and the Soviet Union and striving for the cause of lasting world peace after they are signed.

　　给帝国主义者一个当头棒喝
    全国各界兴奋鼓舞  拥护中苏兄弟同盟
    李济深
    我站在中苏友好立场上，对于中苏友好同盟互助条约的签订，作无保留的赞同和拥护。这个喜讯，不禁使我欢欣若狂，同时看见一般的人民群众也眉飞色舞起来，共同庆祝周兼外交部长在莫斯科签订这些条约和协定的成功。这一历史空前的发展，标志着我们中苏两大国的人民，由于十月革命后三十多年来的友谊集中表现于这些条约的文字和精神上，是好像兄弟一样地互相协助着。我们还可以说三十多年来，由于种种事实再加上这些条约，证明了苏联人民和苏联政府对于中国人民的友爱是始终不渝的。就这次条约的内容来分析，更觉得有无穷尽的友邦的厚谊与隆情，尤其是照顾到今天中国人民的利益。对于整个中国经济的发展有莫大的推动力。这是美国帝国主义一类的国家所梦想不到的。当他们正在造谣说苏联要求中国开放五个港口，独霸东北的时候，忽然广播中苏新约完成，不啻霹雳一声给帝国主义者一个当头棒喝！原来蒋匪帮反动政权所订一九四五年中苏友好同盟条约，为期是三十年，苏联曾经根据这条约，直接出兵东北，援助中国人民，击溃了日本帝国主义，迫使它俯首投降，现在中国人民自己成立了中华人民共和国，苏联就和我国重订新约，主要的任务是坚决地加强中苏两大国间的友好和合作，共同防止日本帝国主义之再起，或日本及其他用任何形式在侵略行为上与日本相勾结的国家之重新侵略。中苏并且都愿意共同努力巩固远东和世界的持久和平与普遍安全。这是历史上何等崇高何等伟大的任务！我相信如此进展，足可保证国际和平民主阵营将获得基本上的辉煌胜利了。至于三亿美金贷款协定的签订，尤其使中国人民深切感激的。因为自第二次世界大战后，苏联的战争创伤尚未完全恢复，慨然以巨款借贷我们，实即是援助我们，希望中国和平建设计划不受战后经济破坏的影响，而可能迅速地走上工业化的路。苏联对我们这种友谊的帮助，促成了中国建设的进步，真应当如毛主席所说的“苏联一切的友谊是中国人民所永不会忘记的。”我现在以中苏友好协会之一员，表示对于苏联友邦暨斯大林大元帅热烈诚挚的感谢，并预祝这几种条约和协定签订后对于防范中苏共同敌人，争取世界持久和平事业的伟大贡献。
