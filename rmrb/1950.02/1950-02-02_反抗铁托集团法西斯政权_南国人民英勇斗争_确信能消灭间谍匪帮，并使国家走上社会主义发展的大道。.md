Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 31st - TASS Moscow reports: *Truth* recently published an article by Golubovich entitled "The Struggle of the Laboring People of Yugoslavia Against the Tito Clique," stating: The laboring people of Yugoslavia are rising up to fight against Tito, and hundreds and thousands of Yugoslav patriots and loyal friends of the Soviet Union have already heroically sacrificed themselves in the struggle. In order to separate the Yugoslav people from the Soviet Union and the socialist camp, and to transform Yugoslavia into a colony of imperialist countries, the Tito fascist clique created bloody terror within the country and established a lawless system. Under this system, the Yugoslav Communist Party has become an auxiliary organ of the State Security Department's secret police; the ideas of Marxism-Leninism have been replaced by fascist ideas; and the executive organs of all Yugoslav mass organizations have been transformed into tools of the fascist police organs to support their system of cruelly exploiting the masses.

However, the Yugoslav people have not been overwhelmed, and they are waging a struggle against the fascist regime. The Yugoslav people are increasingly realizing the necessity of participating in an organized struggle to overthrow the hateful Tito clique, establish a truly people's democratic regime dedicated to socialist construction, and return the country to the fraternal family of people's democratic nations.

In Yugoslavia, slogans are increasingly appearing expressing the people's love for the Soviet Union and calling for the overthrow of Tito's fascists. Workers are struggling against the most brutal fascist exploitation, against excessive working hours and meager wages, and against being forcibly mobilized to work in factories and mines to produce excess profits for foreign capitalists.

Farmers are fighting against the relentless plunder of Rankovic's guards, who seize agricultural products and transport them to capitalist countries.

In Serbia, Vojvodina (Yugoslavia's grain-producing center), Croatia, Slovenia, and Montenegro, the autumn sowing plan had been fulfilled by less than 19 percent by the end of October, while in other regions it had only been fulfilled by 3 percent or 5 percent.

The Yugoslav people's resistance movement against the Tito traitorous clique is a mass movement with diverse forms of struggle. The Yugoslav people are confident that they can eliminate the currently ruling fascist and spy gangs and guide their country onto the path of socialist development.

　　反抗铁托集团法西斯政权
    南国人民英勇斗争
    确信能消灭间谍匪帮，并使国家走上社会主义发展的大道。
    【新华社北京卅一日电】据塔斯社莫斯科讯：真理报顷刊载高鲁鲍维奇题为“南斯拉夫劳动人民反抗铁托集团的斗争”的专文称：南斯拉夫的劳动人民，正在起来和铁托进行斗争，成千成百的南斯拉夫爱国者和苏联的忠实朋友，已经在斗争中英勇牺牲了。为了使南斯拉夫人民脱离苏联及社会主义阵线，为了变南斯拉夫为帝国主义国家的殖民地，铁托法西斯集团便在国内造成血腥的恐怖，建立了无法无天的制度。在这种制度之下，南斯拉夫共产党已经变成了国家保安处的秘密警察部的辅助机关，马克思——列宁主义的思想，被代以法西斯主义的思想，南斯拉夫所有的群众组织的执行机关，都已被改变成法西斯警察机关的工具，以支持其残酷剥削群众的制度。
    但是，南斯拉夫人民并未被压倒，他们正在进行反法西斯政权的斗争。南斯拉夫人民正越来越了解到有必要参加有组织的斗争，以推翻可恨的铁托集团，建立从事于社会主义建设的真正人民民主政权的国家，使国家重新回到人民民主国家的兄弟大家庭。
    在南斯拉夫，现在越来越多地出现着人民爱戴苏联和号召推翻铁托法西斯的标语口号。工人们进行斗争以反对最残酷的法西斯剥削，反对过长的劳动日和低微的工资，并反对被强迫动员到为外国资本家生产超额利润的工厂和矿坑中去劳动。
    农民对兰科维奇的亲卫队的无情掠夺进行着斗争，这些亲卫队强夺去农产品，并且把它们运至资本主义国家去。
    在塞尔维亚、沃伊沃第纳（南斯拉夫产谷中心）、克罗提亚、斯洛文尼亚和门的内哥罗等处的秋季播种计划，到十月底只执行了不到百分之十九，另一些地区则只执行了百分之三或百分之五。
    南斯拉夫人民对铁托叛逆集团的反抗运动，是群众性的而且有多种多样的斗争形式。南斯拉夫人民确信他们能消灭目前执政的法西斯和间谍匪帮，并且将使他们的国家走上社会主义发展的大道。
