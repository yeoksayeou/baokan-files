Fast Trial of War Criminals to Settle Blood Debts!

Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou, 8th -- According to written reports submitted by Wang Yuzhen, Zheng Jie'an, Yu Hanjie, Jin Qiu and other staff members of the Zhejiang Provincial People's Government Health Department, Japanese war criminals used airplanes to spread plague germs in various parts of Zhejiang during the war of aggression against China, poisoning the Chinese people. The report details how the Japanese troops spread plague germs in Ningbo, Quzhou, Jinhua and other places at that time. The report stated: On October 22, 1940, a Japanese plane invaded the airspace over Ningbo County, flying low and circling, scattering a lot of wheat and cotton. About a week later, on October 29, the first suspected plague patient was discovered in Ningbo County. After examination by doctors, it was confirmed that the patient was infected with the plague. Since then, a total of 99 plague patients have been discovered, of whom 97 died. On October 4 of the same year, a Japanese plane raided Quzhou County and similarly scattered a lot of wheat, millet and other objects, some of which were mixed with fleas. These fleas were confirmed to be "common rat fleas" after testing. After the Japanese plane dropped these wheat, millet and other objects, 22 plague patients were discovered in the county by November 12, all of whom died. In the second year, 1941, and later in 1946 and 1947, Quzhou County suffered three plague attacks, and the number of people who died from plague infection reached a total of 201. On November 26 and 27, 1940, two Japanese planes invaded the city of Jinhua County in two separate sorties, spreading white smoke-like objects in the air. These objects fell on the ground and became light yellow fine particles, which dissolved when exposed to water. The results of the examination by the local People's Hospital revealed that these solutions all contained Gram-negative "staining negative bacilli", proving that they were indeed "plague bacilli". Subsequently, the plague spread in Dongyang, Yiwu, Lanxi and other counties near Jinhua. In Dongyang County, 94 people were infected with the plague, and 92 died. In Yiwu County, 308 people were infected with the plague, and 257 died. In Lanxi County, 36 people were infected with the plague, and 12 died.

　　The Bandit Government Once Concealed the Enemy, Causing Suffering Compatriots to Endure Unjust Suffering
In addition, the former puppet Zhejiang Provincial Government Health Department also received reports from various places about Japanese planes spreading the plague at that time. The report pointed out that on April 21, 1941, Japanese planes also dropped white flocculent substances in Xindeng County, and rats died after eating them. On December 19 of the same year, Japanese planes scattered a large number of spiderweb-like objects and cotton in Zhuji County; on December 10, 1940, a Japanese plane scattered white smoke-like objects in Shangyu County, which fell and turned into colorless and transparent oily fine particles. On December 19 of the same year, four Japanese planes scattered white smoke-like objects in Yangxi County, which dissolved when they fell. Although the puppet Health Department did not receive reports from these places about whether the plague had spread after the Japanese planes dropped the above-mentioned objects, the plague facts already discovered in Ningbo, Quzhou, Jinhua and other places prove that the Japanese planes were undoubtedly spreading plague germs.

　　In their reports, Wang Yuzhen and others expressed indignation at the Kuomintang reactionary government's neglect of the people's lives. When Japanese planes continuously spread plague germs in various parts of Zhejiang, the Kuomintang reactionary government not only did not take appropriate measures, but instead concealed the enemy, believing that the enemy would not use germ warfare. At that time, the Kuomintang's pro-government newspapers did not mention a word about the Japanese planes spreading the plague to poison the Chinese people, causing the people of Zhejiang to suffer from the plague unjustly for ten years. The just trial of Japanese bacterial warfare criminals by the Soviet Maritime Military Tribunal has now revealed the past crimes of Japanese bacterial warfare criminals. The people of Zhejiang firmly support the Soviet Union's note and advocate the establishment of a special international military tribunal to try Japanese bacterial warfare chief war criminals such as Hirohito.

　　According to reports, Wang Yuzhen was the former Chief Technician and Chief of the Epidemic Prevention Section of the puppet Zhejiang Provincial Health Department, Zheng Jie'an was the Chief Technician and Chief of the Medical Administration Section, Yu Hanjie was the Chief of the General Affairs Section, and Jin Qiu was the Director of the Statistics Office.

　　浙省人民政府卫生厅职员
    证明日寇曾散布毒菌
    宁波衢州等地数百人遭受毒害
    【新华社杭州八日电】据浙江省人民政府卫生厅职员王毓榛、郑介安、俞汉杰、金秋等提出的书面报告，证明日本战犯在侵略中国战争中使用飞机在浙江各地散布鼠疫病菌毒害中国人民。该报告详述日寇当时在宁波、衢州、金华等地，散布鼠疫病菌的经过。报告称：一九四零年十月二十二日有日机一架侵入宁波县上空，低飞盘旋，撒下麦子、棉花很多。约一星期后，十月二十九日，宁波县发现第一个鼠疫嫌疑病人，经医生检验鉴定确为被传染鼠疫，此后陆续发现鼠疫病患者共九十九人，其中九十七人都不治死亡。同年十月四日，有日机一架空袭衢州县，也同样散布麦子、粟子等物很多，其中且混有跳蚤。这种跳蚤经过检验，确系“人鼠共同蚤”。在日机投下这些麦子、粟子等物后，至十一月十二日该县就发现有鼠疫病患者二十二人，都不治死亡。至第二年即一九四一年四月和以后一九四六年、一九四七年，衢州县曾三度遭受鼠疫侵袭，因被传染鼠疫而致死亡的人数，前后共达二百零一人。金华县在一九四零年十一月二十六、二十七两日，有日机两架分两次侵入市空，在空中散布白色烟雾状的东西。这些东西落在地面即成淡黄色细小颗粒，遇水即溶化。经该地民众医院检验结果，发现这些溶液内都有革兰氏“着色阴性杆菌”，证明确系“鼠疫杆菌”。此后陆续在金华附近的东阳、义乌、兰溪等县，都有鼠疫蔓延。东阳县被传染鼠疫病的有九十四人，死亡九十二人。义乌县被传染鼠疫病的有三百零八人，死亡二百五十七人。兰溪县被传染鼠疫病的有三十六人，死亡十二人。
    匪帮政府曾为敌掩饰  使受害同胞含冤不白
    此外，前伪浙江省政府卫生处，当时也曾接获各地关于日机散布鼠疫的报告。该报告指出：在一九四一年四月二十一日，日机也在新登县投下白色絮状物，鼠食即死。同年十二月十九日，日机在诸暨县散布大批状似蜘蛛网的东西和棉花等物；一九四○年十二月十日，日机一架在上虞县散布白色烟雾状的东西，落下变成无色透明油质的细粒。同年十二月十九日，日机四架在阳溪县散布白色烟雾的东西，落下即溶化。伪卫生处虽然没有接到各该地在日机投下上述各物以后有无鼠疫蔓延的报告，但根据宁波、衢州、金华等地已经发现的鼠疫的事实，证明日机是散布鼠疫病菌无疑。
    王毓榛等在报告中，对当时国民党反动政府忽视人民生命安全，表示愤恨。日机连续在浙江各地散布鼠疫病菌时，国民党反动政府不仅不采取适当措施，反为敌人掩饰，认为敌人不致使用细菌作战的。当时国民党的御用报纸，对日机散布鼠疫毒杀中国人民的罪行，也只字不提，使浙江人民遭受鼠疫的毒害含冤不白达十年之久。此次苏联滨海军区军事法庭对日本细菌战犯的正义审判，始将过去日本细菌战犯的罪行予以揭露。浙江人民坚决拥护苏联的照会，主张组织特别国际军事法庭，审判裕仁等日本细菌战首要战犯。
