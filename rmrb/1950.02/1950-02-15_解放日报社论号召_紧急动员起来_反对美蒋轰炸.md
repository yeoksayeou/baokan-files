Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, February 14th: The Shanghai Liberation Daily published an editorial on the 12th, calling on the people of Shanghai to urgently mobilize to oppose American-Chiang bombing. The editorial pointed out that the people of Shanghai have achieved victory in the struggle against the blockade, and now they will never bow their heads in the face of bombing and destruction.

    Strengthen air defense equipment, overcome any difficulties, and maintain production. The editorial stated: We must not only actively step up our support for the front lines to strive for the swift liberation of Taiwan, but also actively step up air defense equipment and carry out evacuation work in a planned way, in order to overcome any serious difficulties. To this end, we must change our working methods, organizational forms, and production forms to meet the requirements of air defense evacuation. The editorial calls on all the people of Shanghai to actively carry out the following tasks: First, strengthen power control and distribution to maintain necessary production under any difficult conditions. The people of the city should more consciously abide by the various decisions of power distribution control. Second, step up preparations for water storage equipment, strengthen the management of artesian wells, and universally dig earthen wells. Third, strengthen air defense equipment. Citizens throughout the city should carry out air defense preparations such as digging air raid shelters and repairing basements. Fourth, strengthen fire prevention and firefighting work. In addition to the Public Security Bureau's fire department making full preparations, people's fire brigades and fire prevention groups should be universally established, and fire prevention and firefighting drills should be conducted. Fifth, strengthen rescue work and post-disaster relief work. All public and private health institutions and hospitals should be responsible for emergency medical treatment of personnel injured in air raids. Neighborhood residents should universally organize rescue teams. Sixth, strengthen public security work. The garrison command, public security bureau, and civil affairs bureau should uniformly formulate and implement rules for emergency maintenance of public security during air raids. Strengthen the organization and work of the people's militia and pickets. Seventh, strengthen evacuation work. First, help residents near the main targets of air raids to relocate and evacuate in a step-by-step manner. Factories that cannot resume work due to power outages should, based on the actual situation, negotiate with both labor and management to find ways to subsidize employees' evacuation and return to their hometowns. For all unemployed and jobless residents, efforts should be made to quickly find ways to evacuate them back to their hometowns for production.
