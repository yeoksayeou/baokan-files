    Question: (1) Is it mandatory to purchase government bonds when withdrawing matured value-guaranteed savings deposits? (2) Is it necessary to withdraw a portion of unmatured value-guaranteed savings deposits to purchase government bonds?

    Answer: (1) When withdrawing matured value-guaranteed savings deposits, purchasing government bonds is absolutely not compulsory. (2) The Beijing People's Bank's measure of withdrawing unmatured value-guaranteed savings deposits for purchasing government bonds is solely to accommodate depositors with unmatured deposits who request to convert them into government bonds. Please do not misunderstand.

    答：（１）提取到期的折实储蓄存款时，决不勉强购买公债。（２）北京人民银行的提取未到期折实储蓄存款转购公债办法，完全是为了照顾未到期存户要求转购公债才规定的。不要误解了。
