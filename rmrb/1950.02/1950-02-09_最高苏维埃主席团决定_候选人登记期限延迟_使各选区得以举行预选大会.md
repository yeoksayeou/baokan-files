Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 8th. TASS, Moscow, 7th. Recently, various groups of the working people and public organizations in the Soviet Union have expressed the desire that the electoral committees of various electoral districts should postpone the deadline for registering candidates for deputies to the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union (note: Soviet election law stipulates that candidates should be registered with the district election committee 30 days before the election), so as to further expand the scale of the nomination conferences of representatives of the working people, and to enable each electoral district to hold preliminary conferences. In view of this, the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union has decided to amend Articles 62 and 64 of the "Election Law of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union" to postpone the deadline for candidate registration and stipulate the following: Working people's groups and public organizations that recommend candidates for deputies to the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union shall register candidates with the corresponding constituency election committees no later than twenty days before the election, that is, February 20, 1950; each constituency election committee shall publish materials on the registered candidates no later than fifteen days before the election, that is, February 25, 1950.

　　最高苏维埃主席团决定
    候选人登记期限延迟
    使各选区得以举行预选大会
    【新华社北京八日电】塔斯社莫斯科七日讯：苏联劳动人民的各团体及公众组织近曾表示愿望，即：各选区选举委员会应延迟苏联最高苏维埃代表候选人登记的期限（按：苏联选举法规定候选人应在选举前三十日在区选举委员会登记），俾使劳动人民的代表候选人提名大会的规模有再为扩大的可能，并使各选区得以举行预选大会。苏联最高苏维埃主席团有鉴于此，特决定修改“苏联最高苏维埃选举法”第六十二条及六十四条，延迟候选人登记期限，并规定如下：举荐苏联最高苏维埃代表候选人的劳动人民团体及公众组织，应不迟于选举前二十日即一九五○年二月二十日，向相应的选区选举委员会登记候选人；各选区选举委员会则应不迟于选举前十五日即一九五○年二月二十五日发表有关已登记的候选人的材料。
