　　The Third Day of the First Beijing Municipal Workers' Congress
    Vice Chairman Zhu De Attends and Speaks
    Calling on Workers to Complete This Year's Production Tasks with a Master's Attitude
    Worker Representatives are Very Excited and Respond to Vice Chairman Zhu's Call
    [Beijing News] On the third day (4th) of the First Beijing Municipal Workers' Congress, Vice Chairman Zhu De of the Central People's Government attended and spoke, giving all the representatives infinite encouragement and confidence.
    In the morning, the congress listened to the report by Xiao Ming, Director of the Preparatory Committee of the Beijing Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, on the future tasks of the trade union work of the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions. In the report, Xiao Ming pointed out that the central task of the current trade union work in Beijing is to continue to restore and develop production, consolidate and expand trade union organizations, and carry out systematic worker education. He also explained the specific tasks that should be carried out in the regular work of the trade union in order to complete these central tasks (full text see another article). In the afternoon, when Vice Chairman Zhu of the Central People's Government attended and spoke, the whole hall applauded and cheered, filled with enthusiasm. In his speech, Vice Chairman Zhu pointed out: In the past year, the achievements of the Beijing labor movement have been great. Of the 400,000 workers in Beijing, more than 180,000 have been organized. Workers have already become masters. This year, the focus of Beijing's labor movement should be on restoring and developing production. Under this central task, it is necessary to continue to raise the workers' class consciousness and improve their culture and technology. In the past year, Beijing's industry has not only recovered but also developed. This year, we must continue to restore and develop production, using all methods to increase output, improve quality, reduce costs, and save raw materials. Workers in private factories should also work hard to produce. In accordance with the collective contract, the rights and obligations of both labor and management should be implemented. With excess production, workers' wages and benefits have also increased. Under such mutually beneficial conditions for both labor and management, capitalists benefit, workers benefit, and social wealth also increases. The biggest benefit workers have received is the organization of their own cooperatives, and they should do their best to develop them. Vice Chairman Zhu finally pointed out that workers should complete this year's tasks with a master's attitude, so that Beijing can move from a consumer city to a production city. After Vice Chairman Zhu De's speech, all the representatives gave him warm applause as he walked out of the venue. The cheers lasted for a long time.
    Next, the congress held group discussions on the report by Xiao Ming, Director of the Preparatory Committee of the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, on the future tasks of the trade union work of the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions.
    During the meeting, the presidium read out the congratulatory message from the People's Supervision Committee of the State Administration Council of the Central People's Government to the congress. The Political Department Printing Factory of the North China Military Region presented a flag to the congress as a tribute. In the evening, the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, the Beijing Military Control Commission, and the Beijing Municipal People's Government jointly hosted a dinner for the representatives. After the meal, the congress held a film evening, showing "Boundless Radiance."
    [Reported by This Newspaper] After listening to Vice Chairman Zhu's speech, the worker representatives in Beijing were very excited and unanimously expressed their determination to respond to Vice Chairman Zhu's call with practical actions. Chen Shutang, a representative from the clothing factory, said: "Today is the first time I saw Vice Chairman Zhu, he really looks like someone from my own family." Su Yinsheng, the driver of the "May 1st Labor Model" locomotive of the Fengtai Locomotive Depot, said: "We must respond to Vice Chairman Zhu's call to increase production and ensure the completion of the 1950 production tasks." Xu Jinsheng, a trolley worker representative, said: "Vice Chairman Zhu personally came to guide us, which is an honor for the workers of Beijing. In 1950, we trolley workers must strengthen the protection of vehicles, drive at a steady speed, and increase the number of vehicles on the road to realize Vice Chairman Zhu's call." Wu Zhang, a representative from the 70th Ordnance Factory, said: "In the past, our factory produced water pumps, and although the number increased, we neglected the quality. After listening to Vice Chairman Zhu's words, we will not only increase production in the future, but also ensure that we improve quality." Wang Lianbao, a representative from the People's Printing Factory, said in the group meeting: "In the past, those of us who were engaged in trade union work were always unclear about the relationship between production and welfare. Today, after listening to Vice Chairman Zhu's report, our thinking has become clear: only by doing a good job in production first can welfare be improved."

　　京市首届工人代表大会第三天
    朱德副主席亲临讲话
    号召工人要以主人翁态度完成今年生产任务
    工人代表非常兴奋  响应朱副主席号召
    【北京讯】京市首届工人代表大会第三天（四日），中央人民政府朱德副主席到会讲话，给全体代表以无限鼓励和信心。
    上午，大会听取了市总工会筹委会主任萧明关于市总工会今后工会工作任务的报告。在报告中，萧明指出当前北京市工会工作的中心任务，是继续恢复与发展生产、巩固和扩大工会组织、和进行系统的工人教育。他并说明为了完成这些中心任务，在工会经常工作中应该进行的各项具体工作（全文见另条）。下午，中央人民政府朱副主席到会讲话时，全场鼓掌欢呼，热情洋溢。朱副主席讲话中指出：一年来，北京工运工作的成绩是很大的。北京四十万工人，已经组织起来的有十八万多人。工人已经作了主人翁。今年北京市工运工作要以恢复与发展生产为中心。在这个中心任务之下，要继续提高工人的阶级觉悟，提高文化和技术。过去一年北京工业不仅恢复，而且发展了。今年要继续恢复发展生产，用一切方法，增加产量、提高质量、减低成本、节省原料。私营工厂工人，也应努力生产。按照集体合同，执行劳资双方的权利义务。有了超额生产，工人的工资福利也增加了。在这样的劳资两利的条件下，资本家有好处，工人也有好处，社会财富也增多了。工人得到的最大的一项福利是组织了自己的合作社，应该尽力发展它。朱副主席最后指出，工人要以主人翁的态度，来完成今年任务，使北京从消费城市向生产城市迈进一步。朱德副主席讲话后，全体代表以热烈的掌声，送他步出会场。欢呼声经久不息。
    接着，大会分组讨论了市总工会筹委会主任萧明关于市总工会今后工会工作任务的报告。
    在会议进行中，主席团宣读了中央人民政府政务院人民监察委员会给大会的贺电。华北军区政治部印刷厂向大会献旗致敬。晚间，中共北京市委员会、北京市军管会和北京市人民政府，联合招待代表聚餐。饭后大会举行电影晚会，放映《万丈光芒》。
    【本报讯】京市工人代表听了朱副主席的讲话以后，都非常兴奋，一致表示要以实际行动响应朱副主席的号召。被服厂代表陈书堂说：“我今天第一次看到朱副主席，真像看见自己家里人一样”。丰台机务段“五一劳动号”机车司机长苏寅生说：“我们一定要响应朱副主席提高生产的号召，保证完成一九五○年的生产任务”。电车工人代表许金生说：“朱副主席亲自来指导我们，这是北京工人的光荣。我们电车工人在一九五○年一定要加强保护车辆，开匀车档，增加出车数量，来实现朱副主席的号召”。七十兵工厂代表吴璋说：“我们工厂过去造水泵，数目虽增加了，但忽略了质量。听了朱副主席的话，以后我们不但要增加产量，还要保证提高质量”。人民印刷厂代表王连宝在小组会上说：“从前我们搞工会工作的人，在生产和福利两方面的关系总闹不清。今天听了朱副主席的报告，思想上明确了：只有先把生产搞好，福利才能增进”。
