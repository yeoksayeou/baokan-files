The Shijingshan Power Plant Holds Worker Training Class
　　Workers' Class Consciousness Enhanced, Party and League Both Develop

[Our Newspaper] The Shijingshan Power Plant in the outskirts of Beijing held a worker training class on November 15th of last year. Significant results have been achieved in the past two months. To meet the needs of the workers, the class is divided into day and night sessions, with a total of 230 people. The content of the study focuses on labor creating the world, class struggle, the Party Constitution, and internationalist education. The method is collective class instruction. After two months of study, the general students have improved ideologically and politically. Previously, workers believed that their suffering was due to bad fate or bad feng shui in their ancestral graves. Some even thought that being a worker was not as good as being a businessman. Among the staff, there was a serious sense of exploitation and they looked down on the workers. After the study, the workers realized that labor creates the world: "Power generation is impossible without workers"; "Without farmers, there would be no food." They learned that ghosts and superstitions were used by the ruling class to intimidate the people. The staff also generally recognized the greatness of labor. Wang Zhenyu used to believe in God, but now his thinking has changed. The staff had always despised manual labor. During the major cleanup, they worked with the workers to sweep away more than a thousand tons of soil. This phenomenon had never been seen before the study. In studying class struggle and the Party Constitution, the training class was able to combine the actual ideological situation of the workers, resolve many past muddled understandings, expose reactionary propaganda, and enable everyone to further approach the Party. According to non-Party students, the new Party members in the factory are all good workers, active in production, and even criticize shortcomings, which is truly seeking truth from facts.

    Due to the increased class and political consciousness of the workers, the workers' production enthusiasm has also greatly increased. Students Zhao Wenduan, Mu Runxiang, Tian Feng and others even secretly worked overtime for seven hours after class. They were only stopped after patient persuasion. After studying, staff member Yang Chuntao examined his conservative thinking on production.

    In addition, the study also strengthened the unity between staff and workers. In this study, they were mixed into groups. In the past, workers had never been to the staff's dormitories, bathrooms, or dining halls, but this time they went. As soon as the workers got off work, covered in oil and mud, they sat on the staff's beds and enthusiastically participated in the discussions, with the staff taking notes. They also debated issues with each other. Some staff members said, "My family has a hundred mu of land, and we are a poor family," but the workers said, "My family doesn't have even one mu of land." This debate made the staff recognize their family composition and gradually put down their high airs, determined to learn from the workers.

    Because everyone had a clear understanding of the Communist Party, twenty outstanding non-Party students have been honorably approved to join the Party, and another twenty-seven have joined the Communist Youth League.

    The experience gained by the training class is: First, Party and League members must play a backbone role. Second, staff and workers should be mixed into groups. Third, in teaching methods, it is necessary to combine the thinking of the students with the specific situation of the factory, and make full preparations before class. For example, when talking about the Communist Party, start with the views of some workers on the Party in the past, and then talk about the new views.

　　石景山发电厂举办职工轮训班
    工人阶级觉悟提高   
    党与团都获得发展
    【本报讯】京郊石景山发电厂于去年十一月十五日举办职工轮训班。两个月来收到相当成绩。为了适合职工需要，该班分为日、夜两班，共有人数二百三十人。学习内容以劳动创造世界、阶级斗争、党章和国际主义教育为主。方式是集体上课。经过两月学习，一般学员在思想上政治上都有提高。以前工人认为自己受苦是由于命苦、坟地风水太坏。也有的认为当工人不如当商人。职员中则严重地存在着剥削意识，看不起工人。学习后，工人们认识了劳动创造世界：“发电没有工人就不行”；“没有农民就没有粮食”。知道了鬼神迷信是统治阶级利用来恐吓人民的。职员也普遍认识了劳动的伟大。王振宇过去信上帝，现在思想转变了。职员们从来轻视体力劳动，这次发动大清扫时他们也和工人一起，把一千多吨土一扫而光。这种现象在学习以前是没有见过的。该训练班在学习阶级斗争和党章时，都能结合职工的实际思想情况，解决过去很多的糊涂认识，揭破反动的宣传，使大家进一步靠近了党。据非党学员反映：厂内的新党员都是好职工，生产积极，有了缺点还要批评，真是实事求是。
    由于提高了工人的阶级觉悟和政治觉悟，工人们的生产情绪也大为提高。学员赵文端、穆润祥、田丰等，下了课还去偷着加班干活七小时之久。经耐心劝阻才停止。职员杨春涛在学习后，检讨了生产上的保守思想。
    此外，经过学习也加强了职员与工人间的团结。在这次学习中，他们混合编组，职员的宿舍、澡堂、饭厅，过去工人从未去过，这次也去了。工人们一下班，满身是油泥，就坐在职员的床上热烈参加发言，职员当记录。他们并互相争论问题：有的职员说：“我家有百把亩地，是贫寒之家”，工人却说：“我家一亩地也没有”。这个争论使职员认识了自己的家庭成份，并逐步放下了高贵的架子，决心向工人学习。
    由于大家对共产党有了清楚的认识，有二十名优秀的非党学员已光荣地被批准入党，另二十七名加入了青年团。
    该训练班现在得到的经验是：第一、党、团员要起骨干作用。第二、职员与工人要混合编组。第三、在教学方法上，要根据学员的思想和本厂的具体情况相结合，上课前并作充分准备。如讲共产党，就从若干职工过去对党的看法讲起，以后再讲新的看法。
