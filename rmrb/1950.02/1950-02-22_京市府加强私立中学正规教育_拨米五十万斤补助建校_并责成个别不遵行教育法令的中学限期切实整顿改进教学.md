　　Beijing Municipal Government Strengthens Formal Education in Private Middle Schools
　　Allocates 500,000 Jin of Millet to Subsidize School Construction
    Orders Individual Middle Schools Not Complying with Educational Laws to Rectify and Improve Teaching Within a Specified Time
    [Report from this newspaper] The Beijing Municipal People's Government's Bureau of Culture and Education recently allocated 500,000 jin of millet to subsidize private secondary schools in order to improve their learning facilities and facilitate formal education. There are sixty-five private secondary schools in Beijing, accounting for about three-quarters of the city's total number of secondary schools, with approximately 27,519 students, representing slightly less than two-thirds of the city's total number of secondary school students. Since liberation, the People's Government has generally adopted the policy of "protecting and maintaining, strengthening leadership, and gradually transforming" them. Over the past year, most schools have made considerable progress in administrative leadership, learning order, ideological education, guidance in democratic life, and improvement of teaching methods. Therefore, at the end of the last semester, the Bureau of Culture and Education rewarded and subsidized Chinese-run private secondary schools with achievements in transformation and economic difficulties, or those with development conditions but unable to improve learning facilities. More than thirty schools, such as Xinsheng, Yude, Datong, Shandong, Zhonghua, and Yanji, received a total subsidy of 500,000 jin of millet. Currently, the school affairs committees of each school are drafting distribution plans based on the amount of subsidies and reporting to the Bureau for claiming. According to Han Huantang, principal of Datong Middle School: This subsidy to private middle schools is not only an urgent financial assistance but also demonstrates that today's People's Government's policy towards private schools is one of protection and maintenance. This is a head-on blow to the doubts of some backward elements and the rumors of reactionary elements, and its significance is very significant. Yanji Middle School's distribution plan for the subsidy has decided to allocate 38% for repair and purchase of equipment, 28% for purchase of books, and 34% for repairing the girls' school buildings. It is expected that these schools will undergo further transformation with the efforts of the school authorities. However, on the other hand, there are still a very few private middle schools in this city, such as Weixin Middle School, which have not only failed to improve over the past year, but also have poor facilities and chaotic order. The board of directors is not only unable to take responsibility but also condones backward forces colluding with unscrupulous elements inside and outside the school to disrupt school order, and perfunctorily ignores government educational laws and regulations. Although the Municipal Government's Bureau of Culture and Education once sent a working group to assist in rectification in November, the learning order has never been established. Furthermore, Kongjiao Middle School, after liberation, not only failed to declare registration according to the date announced by the government but also consistently suppressed all instructions, orders, and notices given to the school by the Municipal Bureau of Culture and Education, the Municipal Student Union, and the Municipal Education Union, ignoring them, let alone complying with them. Students are arbitrarily subjected to corporal punishment. There is no timetable for classes, and the students and the teachers decide on the class schedule on an ad hoc basis each day. The poor management of the school is evident. Furthermore, Shixi Middle School has small school buildings, with only eight dilapidated classrooms. Most of the general equipment is temporarily borrowed from students' relatives and friends. The principal teaches seven subjects, and the board of directors is mostly composed of his relatives and friends, forming a mere formality and unable to lead, resulting in consistently chaotic learning order over the years. In order to rectify such poorly managed schools, the Bureau of Culture and Education has issued instructions separately, ordering the school authorities to effectively rectify and improve necessary equipment, improve teaching, and earnestly implement government educational laws and instructions, and implement the New Democracy educational policy within a specified period.

　　京市府加强私立中学正规教育
　　拨米五十万斤补助建校
    并责成个别不遵行教育法令的中学限期切实整顿改进教学
    【本报讯】京市人民政府文教局近拨发小米五十万斤，补助私立中等学校健全学习设备，以利进行正规教育。京市私立中等学校共六五所，约占全市中等学校总数的四分之三；拥有学生二七、五一九人，约当全市中学生总数的三分之二弱。解放后人民政府对他们一般采取了“保护维持、加强领导、逐步改造”的方针。一年来，一般学校在行政领导、学习秩序、思想教育、民主生活指导以及教学方法的改进上，都有了相当进步。因此，文教局在上学期结束时，对中国人办的私立中等学校改造有成绩并经济困难者，或有发展条件而无力充实学习设备者，分别予以奖励和补助，如新生、育德、大同、山东、中华、燕冀等三十余校，共补助小米五十万斤。现各校校务委员会正依照补助数目草拟支配计划，报局请领中。据大同中学校长韩焕堂谈：这次对私立中学的补助，不但在经费上是一个迫切的帮助，而且说明了今天人民政府对私立学校的政策是保护维持的。这对于某些落后分子的怀疑和反动分子的造谣，是迎头一棒，意义非常重大。燕冀中学对补助费的支配计划，决定百分之三十八作为修理及购置仪器之用，百分之二十八作购置图书之用，百分之三十四作为修盖女校校舍之用。预期这些学校在各校当局的努力下将有进一步的改造。但是在另一方面，本市仍有极少数私立中学如维新中学，一年来不仅未见改进，且设备简陋、秩序混乱，董事会既无力负责，且纵容落后势力勾结校内外不良分子破坏学校秩序，对政府教育法令，阳奉阴违，因循敷衍。十一月间市府文教局虽一度派遣工作组前往协助整顿，而学习秩序始终没有建立起来。又如孔教中学，解放后不但不按照政府公布日期申报登记，且一贯对市文教局、市学联、市教联所给该校的一切指示、命令、通知等，故意扣压，置之不理，更谈不到遵行。对学生随便体罚。上课没有课程表，每日多由学生向到校先生临时商议决定。学校办理不善由此可见。再如世熙中学校舍狭小，仅有破烂教室八间，一般用具亦多系向学生亲友临时借用，校长一人任课七门，校董会亦多系其亲友组成，形同虚设，无力领导，以致年来学习秩序始终混乱。为了整顿此类办理不善的学校，文教局已分别予以指示，责成学校当局在限定日期内，切实整顿充实必要之设备，改进教学，认真执行政府教育法令与指示，贯彻新民主主义教育方针。
