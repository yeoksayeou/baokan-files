Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, February 8th. Recently, the Kuomintang remnants' bombing of Shanghai and other places in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River was carried out with the direct participation of American imperialists and Japanese aggressors supported by them. Reliable sources indicate that Japanese air force personnel, Japanese naval personnel, and Japanese technicians recruited by MacArthur, the executor of American imperialist Far East aggression policy, have been successively dispatched to Taiwan to participate in the Kuomintang remnant bandit group's operations against the Chinese people, particularly in the execution of bombing and blockade missions. The fact that Japanese naval and air force personnel are assisting the bandits in combat has been confirmed by American news agencies. A United Press dispatch from Tokyo on December 2nd of last year stated: "A senior official of the occupation authorities said: The news that a former senior Japanese army officer stationed in Taiwan is organizing a Japanese foreign air force corps to fight for the Kuomintang is true."

　　美帝及日本侵略分子  助残匪轰炸上海等地
    【新华社北京八日电】最近国民党残匪对长江下游上海等地的轰炸是在美帝国主义者及其扶持下的日本侵略分子直接参预下进行的。可靠的消息表示，由美帝国主义远东侵略政策执行者麦克阿瑟招募的日本空军人员、日本海军人员和日本技术人员已被陆续派往台湾，参加国民党残余匪帮对中国人民的作战，特别是在执行轰炸和封锁的任务方面。日本海空军人员助匪作战的事实，曾为美国通讯社证实。合众社去年十二月二日东京电即称：“一位占领当局高级官员说：前日本驻台湾的高级陆军军官正进行组织日本人的外国空军大队以为国民党作战的消息是真实的。”
