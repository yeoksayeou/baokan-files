　　The Soviet Army is a New Type of Army
　　By N. Kozlov, Translated by Zhang Quanmin
　　The Soviet working people and all progressive humanity will commemorate the thirty-second anniversary of the Soviet Army this year.

　　Thirty-two years ago, a new and unprecedented army in human history was born—the Workers' and Peasants' Army. The Soviet Army, established and cultivated by the Bolshevik Party, by the great strategists of the socialist revolution, Lenin and Stalin, firmly protects the world's first socialist country and world peace.

　　All armies that existed before were institutions that protected the interests of the ruling exploiting classes. In their relationship with the people, these armies were an alien and hostile force. They were used to suppress the resistance of the exploited at home and to enslave other countries and peoples.

　　Moreover, the armies of modern imperialist countries are even more so. They are armed fortresses of the reactionary imperialist bourgeoisie and tools for intimidating and suppressing progressive and democratic movements at home, that is, tools for implementing imperialist aggression and policies of enslaving people.

　　The Soviet Army is a new type of army. The Soviet state, by its very nature, is a truly people's state, one that rejects imperialist aggression and the policy of strangling the freedom and independence of other nations. Soviet policy is one of maintaining friendship and peace among nations, and respecting the rights of large and small nations.

　　The Soviet Army is a truly people's army. Its popular character is determined by its entire composition—that is, its soldiers and officers are from the people, from the laborers; it is determined by the fact that it defends the interests of the people and the interests of all laborers. Therefore, the Soviet Army has won the love of all the people.

　　The Soviet Army is an army that defends the freedom and independence of all nations within the Soviet Union. From its very beginning, the Soviet Army has been cultivated in the spirit of internationalism, respect for other nations, and advocacy of peace among nations.

　　These characteristics of the Soviet Army determine its historical mission as a great army of liberation.

　　The Soviet Army clearly demonstrated its role in the war of liberation as early as the war against domestic reactionaries and foreign interventionists in 1917-1920. At that time, the young and still unconsolidated armed forces of the Soviet Republic had to wage a war of liberation against the American, British, French, Japanese, and other imperialists. This was a just war of national defense waged by the Russian people, liberated by the revolution, to fight for the freedom, dignity, and independence of the Soviet Republic against enemies at home and abroad. Although the enemy was superior to the Soviet Army in the experience of its military cadres and in the supply of weapons, ammunition, clothing, and food, the Soviet Army, led by the brilliant revolutionary strategists Lenin and Stalin, became the victor in this unequal battle, driven by the great and noble mission of liberation.

　　The great mission of liberation of the Soviet armed forces was particularly brilliantly demonstrated in the Second World War, when the peoples of Europe fell under the iron heel of Hitlerism, and the whole world faced the danger of being enslaved by bloody fascism.

　　Stalin, the brilliant leader of the Soviet people and all progressive humanity, pointed out in his broadcast on July 3, 1941: "The purpose of the nationwide patriotic war against the fascist oppressors is not only to eliminate the danger facing our country, but also to help the people of Europe who are groaning under the iron heel of German fascism."

　　In his speech reviewing the Soviet Army on November 7, 1941, when the enemy threatened the heart of the Soviet Union—Moscow, Stalin said the following inspiring words to the soldiers of the Soviet Army: "The whole world regards you as the force that can eliminate the German aggressors. The enslaved people of Europe, who have fallen under the iron heel of the German aggressors, regard you as their liberators. A great mission of liberation rests on your shoulders, do not fail this mission!"

　　The Soviet Army showed in the war that it did not fail this great mission of liberation. Its recognition of the great mission it bore was one of the inexhaustible sources of strength for the Soviet Army in its struggle against the enemy.

　　Driven by this noble consciousness and led by Stalin's genius, the Soviet Army displayed unprecedented models of mass heroism in its struggle against the German fascist aggressors and Japanese imperialists. It revealed the true greatness of moral spirit. In the Great Patriotic War, the Soviet Army, through its self-sacrificing struggle, not only saved the honor, freedom, and independence of the Soviet Union, but also saved all freedom-loving people and the culture of the entire world from the iron heel of German fascism.

　　The Soviet Army drove the German fascist aggressors out of its own country, resolutely pursued the enemy, and brought freedom to the enslaved people of various countries. Wherever the Soviet Army went, the people gained the full possibility to independently determine their own destiny and build their lives according to their own wishes.

　　The great Soviet Army rapidly entered the countries of Central and Southeastern Europe, enabling the people of these countries to establish truly democratic systems in their own countries, realize the most profound social and economic progressive reforms, and move towards socialism. Due to the liberating role of the Soviet Army, these countries have become a powerful factor for peace, democracy, and progress in Europe.

　　The same thing happened in the Far East, where the Soviet Army crushed the million-strong Japanese Kwantung Army, forcing imperialist Japan to surrender. In this way, the Soviet Army liberated the people of the Far East from the iron heel of Japanese imperialism. The Soviet Army completed its great mission of liberation and left the borders of the countries it had liberated from the enemy's iron heel. Demonstrations were held everywhere to welcome the Soviet Army, and the people of various countries expressed their warm gratitude and love to their liberators.

　　The Soviet Army's defeat of German fascism and Japanese imperialism was a powerful factor enabling the Chinese people to defeat the combined forces of domestic reactionaries and American imperialism. Mao Zedong, the glorious leader of the Chinese people, particularly emphasized this factor. He wrote: "If there were no Soviet Union, if there were no victory in the anti-fascist Second World War, if Japanese imperialism had not been overthrown, if new democratic countries had not emerged, if the oppressed nations of the East were not rising to fight... then, the international reactionary forces piled on our heads would certainly be many times greater than they are now. In this situation, could we have won? Obviously not. If we had won, it would not have been possible to consolidate... ..."

　　The role played by the British and American armies was completely different. In those countries where they were stationed after the war, and those countries where they are still stationed today, they have appeared as stranglers of the freedom and independence of the people of various countries. With the help of British bayonets, a monarchy was established in Greece against the will of the freedom-loving Greek people. In Greece, extreme terrorism by royalist gangs is rampant. With the support of the British army and the encouragement of the American military delegation, the royalists massacred the outstanding sons and daughters of the Greek people. The puppet government of South Korea exists under the support of American bayonets, and this government is hostile to the Korean people. French colonialists, against the will of the French people, are waging a criminal war against the heroic people of Vietnam. And the British army is waging war against the resistance movement of the Malayans who do not want to be slaves of imperialism.

　　The sympathy and love of progressive humanity throughout the world, and the entire international anti-imperialist democratic camp, are on the side of the Soviet Union and its heroic army. The people of the world will never forget the great liberating role played by the Soviet Army in the Second World War, and they will never forget its immortal feats for all nations.

　　The Soviet Army became the first-class army of our time in the war, an army with modern equipment, the most experienced commanders, and a high morale and fighting qualities. In the post-war period, the officers and soldiers of the Soviet Army and Navy have continued to complete their combat political preparation, mastering the advanced military technology that only socialist industry can give to such an armed force. The Soviet armed forces are a threat to all aggressors and fanatics of world domination.

　　The working people of the world are opposing the Anglo-American war instigators and striving for lasting democratic peace. They are turning their eyes to the great Soviet Union and its glorious army, seeing it as an unbreakable fortress of peace, freedom, and progress.

　　苏联军队是新型的军队
    Ｎ·柯兹洛夫作  张全民译
    苏联劳动人民和一切进步人类将纪念本年苏维埃军队三十二周年。
    三十二年前，在人类历史上诞生了新的空前未有的军队——工农军。由布尔什维克党、由社会主义革命的伟大战略家列宁和斯大林所建立和培养的苏维埃军队，巩固地保护了世界上第一个社会主义国家和全世界的和平。
    所有以前存在的军队，都是保护统治的剥削阶级利益的机构，这些军队在对待人民的关系上是一种异己的、敌意的力量。它们是被利用来压迫国内被剥削者们的反抗以及奴役其他国家和人民的。
    更有进者，现代帝国主义国家的军队，更其如此。它们是反动的帝国主义资产阶级之武装堡垒，是威吓和镇压国内进步和民主运动的工具，即实现帝国主义侵略政策和奴役人民的政策之工具。
    苏维埃军队是新型的军队。苏维埃国家就其性质讲，是真正人民的国家，是排斥帝国主义侵略政策的，是排斥扼杀其他民族自由与独立的政策的。苏维埃政策，这是一种保持各国之间友好与和平的政策，尊重大小民族权利的政策。
    苏维埃军队，这是真正人民的军队。它的人民性决定于它的全部成份，——即它的士兵和军官都是从人民、从劳动者们中来的；决定于它是保卫人民的利益以及所有劳动者们的利益的。因此，苏维埃军队获得了全体人民的热爱。
    苏维埃军队，这是保卫苏维埃国内所有一切民族的自由和独立的军队。苏维埃军队从建立之初，就是以国际主义的精神、以尊重其他各民族和主张各国之间的和平的精神培养起来的。
    苏维埃军队的这些特征，决定了它的历史任务，即伟大的解放者的军队。
    苏维埃军队，早在一九一七——一九二○年反抗国内反动派及国外干涉者的战争中，就明显地表示了解放战争的作用。那时苏维埃共和国的年青的还不巩固的武装力量就不得不进行了反抗美英法日及其他帝国主义者的解放斗争。这就是被革命以解放的俄罗斯人民为争取苏维埃共和国自由尊严与独立、反对内外敌人的解放的正义的卫国战争。虽然敌人在其军事干部的经验上，在武器弹药、被服粮食的供给上都优于苏维埃军队，但是，天才的革命的战略家列宁和斯大林所领导的苏维埃军队，由于伟大高尚的解放的使命之推动，在这非势均力敌的战斗中成了胜利者。
    苏维埃武装力量的伟大的解放使命，特别光辉地在第二次世界大战中表现出来了，当时欧洲各国人民都落在希特勒主义的铁蹄下，全世界面临着被血腥的法西斯主义所奴役的危险。
    苏维埃人民和全世界全部进步人类的天才领袖斯大林在其一九四一年七月三日的广播中指出：“反抗法西斯压迫者的全民性的卫国战争，其目的不仅是消灭了我们国家所面临的危险，而且也是在帮助在德国法西斯铁蹄下呻吟的欧洲人民”。
    在敌人威胁苏联心脏——莫斯科的日子里，斯大林在一九四一年十一月七日检阅苏维埃军队的演说中，对于苏维埃军队军人说了下面的令人鼓舞的话：“全世界都把你们看作能消灭德国侵略者的力量。落在德国侵略者铁蹄下的被奴役的欧洲人民，都把你们看作自己的解放者。伟大的解放使命落在你们的肩上，不要辜负这个使命啊！”
    苏维埃军队在战争中，表明了它没有辜负这个伟大的解放使命。它认识到自己所负的伟大使命，这是苏维埃军队在其与敌人的斗争中取之不尽的丰富的源泉之一。
    受这种高尚的意识所推动、由斯大林天才所领导的苏维埃军队，反对德国法西斯侵略者及日本帝国主义者的斗争中，表现了前所未见的英勇豪迈的群众的英雄主义之模范。显露了道义精神之真正的伟大。苏维埃军队在伟大卫国战争中，以自己的自我牺牲的斗争，不仅拯救了苏联的荣誉、自由和独立，而且也从德国法西斯者铁蹄下，拯救了一切爱好自由的人民和整个世界的文化。
    苏维埃军队从自己的国土赶走了德国法西斯侵略者，坚决地追击敌人，给被奴役的各国人民带来了自由。凡苏维埃军队所到过的一切地方，人民都获得了完全的可能性，去独立地决定自己的命运，照着自己的愿望，建设自己的生活。
    苏联伟大的军队迅速地进入中欧和东南欧各国，使这些国家的人民得以在自己的国内建立真正民主的制度，实现最深邃的社会经济的进步的改革，并走向社会主义。由于苏维埃军队的解放作用，这些国家成了欧洲和平民主与进步之强有力的因素。
    在远东也发生了同样的情形，在这里苏维埃军队粉碎了百万的日本关东军，迫使帝国主义的日本投降。这样，苏维埃军队从日本帝国主义的铁蹄下解放了远东人民。苏维埃军队完成了自己的伟大的解放使命，便离开了被它从敌人铁蹄下所解放出来的国家之境界。各地欢送苏维埃军队举行了示威游行，各国人民对于自己的解放者表示了热烈的感谢和热爱。
    苏维埃军队之击溃德国法西斯和日本帝国主义，乃使中国人民得以战胜国内反动派和美帝国主义联合力量的一个强大因素。中国人民的光荣领袖，毛泽东特别强调这个因素，他写道：“假如没有苏联的存在，假如没有反法西斯的第二次世界大战的胜利，假如没有打倒日本帝国主义，假如没有各新民主国家的出现，假如没有东方各被压迫民族正在起来斗争……那么，堆在我们头上的国际反动势力必定比现在不知要大多少倍，在这种情形下，我们要胜利么？显然是不能的。胜利了，要巩固，也不可能。………”
    英美军队所起的作用是完全不同的。在他们战后所驻扎过的那些国家以及他们直到现在仍驻扎的那些国家里，他们表现为各国人民自由与独立的扼杀者。在英军刺刀的帮助下，在希腊，违反爱好自由的希腊人民之意志，而建立了君主政权。在希腊，盛行着保皇党匪帮的极端恐怖主义。在英军的支持和美国军事代表团的鼓动下，保皇派屠杀了希腊人民的优秀儿女。南朝鲜的傀儡政府是在美军刺刀支持之下存在的，这个政府是敌视朝鲜人民的。法国殖民者，违反法国人民的意志，进行罪恶的战争以反对越南英勇人民。而英国军队正在进行战争，以反对那不愿作帝国主义奴隶的马来亚人的反抗运动。
    全世界进步人类、整个国际反帝国主义的民主阵营之同情与热爱，都是在苏联及它的英勇的军队方面。全世界人民永不会忘记苏维埃军队在第二次世界大战中所起的伟大的解放作用，他们永不会忘记它对各族人民的不朽的功勋。
    苏维埃军队在战争中成了我们时代的第一等的军队，这军队有着现代的装备，经验最丰富的指挥官及士气旺盛的战斗品质。在战后的时间里，苏维埃陆军和海军的官兵，不断地完成其战斗的政治的准备，掌握高度的军事技术，这种技术只有社会主义工业才能给予这样的武装力量的。苏联武装力量对于一切侵略者及热狂于世界统治者，是一种威胁。
    全世界的劳动人民，都在反对英美战争挑拨者，争取持久的民主和平，他们把自己的视线都朝向伟大的苏联和它的光荣军队，看到它是和平、自由、进步之牢不可破的堡垒。
