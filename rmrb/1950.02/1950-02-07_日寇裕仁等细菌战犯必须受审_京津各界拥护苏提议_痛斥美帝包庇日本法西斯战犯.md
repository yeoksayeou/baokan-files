[Beijing News] All circles in the capital unanimously support the Soviet government's proposal to try Japanese fascist bacteriological warfare criminals, firmly advocate severely punishing Japanese Emperor Hirohito and other war criminals, and strongly condemn the American imperialists' crime of shielding Japanese fascist war criminals. Xiao Ming, Director of the Preparatory Committee of the Beijing Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, said: "We Chinese workers and the Chinese people will never forget the crimes of Japanese imperialism's invasion of China. Japanese Emperor Hirohito is the number one war criminal who launched the war of aggression against China. The result of the Soviet Far East Military Tribunal's trial of Japanese fascist bacteriological warfare criminals proves that Japanese Emperor Hirohito was the organizer who used bacteriological weapons to brutally kill the people of China and the Soviet Union. We firmly support the Soviet government's note to our government proposing the establishment of a special international military tribunal to try war criminals such as Hirohito. This just proposal of the Soviet government fully conforms to the will of the Chinese people and the Chinese working class. These heinous war criminals must be punished; at the same time, the people of the world must unite around the Soviet Union to oppose the instigators of a new war, so as to ensure that the fruits created by the working people are no longer destroyed and ravaged by the imperialist war of aggression. We Chinese people suffered the inhuman invasion of the Japanese invaders and waged an eight-year heroic war of resistance, and have the right to advocate and participate in the trial of war criminals such as Hirohito. We lodge a serious protest against the crime of American imperialism in shielding war criminals such as Hirohito, and demand that American imperialism immediately hand over war criminals such as Hirohito for trial!"

Yang Bozhen, Deputy Director of the Preparatory Committee of the Beijing Municipal Democratic Youth League, said: "War criminal Hirohito and a group of bacteriological war criminals under his command have completely lost their humanity and committed heinous crimes. We fully support the Soviet proposal to establish a special international military tribunal to try war criminals such as Hirohito, and resolutely oppose the criminal acts of American imperialists in shielding war criminals!"

Fu Huating, Director of the Preparatory Committee of the Beijing Municipal Federation of Industry and Commerce, said: "In the Japanese imperialists' war crimes of aggression against China, in the aggressive war in East Asia, millions of peaceful people have been subjected to inhuman persecution. We will never forget this blood debt of Japanese imperialism. Our industrial and commercial circles unanimously demand that these war criminals be severely punished, but the American imperialists are shielding these war criminals, and they dream of using these war criminals to instigate a new war of aggression. The Soviet proposal represents the demand of all mankind for peace. This proposal exposes the conspiracy of the imperialist warmongers, and all peace-loving people will surely support this proposal."

Qian Duansheng, Vice Chairman of the Beijing Educational Workers' Union, said: "A large group of Japanese fascist bacteriological warfare criminals have confessed their crimes in the trial in Khabarovsk, and have also confessed that Japanese Emperor Hirohito was the one who issued the order to use bacteria for this crime. In order to punish these heinous war criminals and warn the instigators of a new war, a special international military tribunal should be established as soon as possible to try a group of war criminals headed by Hirohito and punish them as they deserve. Therefore, we firmly support the Soviet proposal."

Zou Dexin, Chairman of the Beijing Private Hospital Union, said: "Japanese imperialism used bacteria as a weapon of war. This is an inhumane and inhuman act that violates international law and is the enemy of all people in the world. Except for beasts like imperialism and warmongers who admit it, all peace-loving people in the world firmly oppose it! Now that the Soviet government has proposed to try Japanese war criminals, it is enough to prove that the Soviet Union is a bulwark of peace. We must firmly stand on the side of the Soviet Union, defend world peace, and use science to create a peaceful, happy, and free world!"

Fei Xiaotong, professor at Tsinghua University, said: "Using bacteria to massacre people is an inhuman and barbaric act, and it also violates international law. We should thank the Soviet Union for exposing this unprecedented criminal act of the Japanese invaders, so that all peace-loving people in the world can see the dehumanizing true face of the imperialists. We have the right to demand the organization of a special international military tribunal to handle this case, so that all war criminals receive the punishment they deserve, and never allow the imperialists to cover up this case."

Li Jinxi, professor at Beijing Normal University, said: "This matter concerns the Far East, especially the poisonous disaster suffered first by the Chinese people. At that time, the fact that there were plague disasters in Changde, Hunan, and the enemy-occupied areas in the southeast has already been proven. This is something that the Chinese people should absolutely not let go of. For the sake of humanity and justice, for the sake of international law and world security, the people of the world will not allow leniency towards these brutal bacteriological warfare criminals. We firmly support the Soviet government's humane and just behavior and proposal, and firmly demand that all Japanese bacteriological warfare criminals who deserve punishment be severely tried."

Lin Handa, Acting Academic Dean of the private Yenching University, said: "The Soviet government's proposal is completely in line with the requirements of mankind. Anyone with a sense of justice and conscience should support this proposal and promote its early realization. The Soviet Union has already publicly tried and sentenced twelve Japanese criminals who were preparing to use bacteriological weapons, but how can the main organizers and encouragers of bacteriological warfare still be at large? Why hasn't the United States published a similar document? Why is MacArthur still shielding the common enemy of mankind?" Xia Ziqiang, Chairman of the Student Union, said: "War criminal Hirohito is continuing to oppress and paralyze the Japanese people under the protection of the American imperialist MacArthur. We firmly support the Soviet government's correct pointing out that Hirohito is the leader of the war criminals and suggesting the establishment of a military tribunal to interrogate these war criminals." Shi Chengbin, a student of the Department of Education, said: "We must firmly support the Soviet note, because this is not only the punishment that war criminals deserve, but also a warning to warmongers."

[Reported by this newspaper] According to a Xinhua News Agency dispatch: Huang Huoqing, Chairman of the Tianjin Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, pointed out: "The entire working class of Tianjin wholeheartedly supports this Soviet proposal. During the War of Resistance Against Japan, the Chinese people suffered the greatest hardship; Japanese imperialism used bacteriological weapons, and the Chinese people were the direct victims. We will never forget the crimes of these executioners, and we will definitely demand the repayment of this blood debt!" He also expressed his firm opposition to the criminal acts of the US military occupation authorities in shielding Japanese war criminals. Luo Yun, Director of the Tianjin Women's Federation, said: "The fact that Hirohito ordered the killing of people with poisonous bacteria has been revealed to the world. If the American imperialist elements continue to protect and conceal these heinous guys, they will be responsible for the blood debt of hundreds of millions of people in the victimized countries!" Zhang Huai, Director of the Preparatory Committee of the Tianjin Municipal Committee of the Communist Youth League, and He Qijun, Chairman of the Tianjin Youth Federation, also made speeches, representing the youth of the city, expressing their firm support for the Soviet government's proposal and protesting against the American imperialists' protection of Japanese war criminals. Xiao Caiyu, Chairman of the University Education Union, said: "We must not allow this inhuman and beastly behavior of imperialism to continue to exist among human beings. We must not let the culprits of these crimes go unpunished. The American imperialists' persistent protection of Japanese war criminals fully exposes their conspiracy to instigate war." Zhang Guofan, professor at Beiyang University, Zhou Shutao, manager of Qixin Cement Company, and others also unanimously expressed their support for the Soviet proposal.

　　日寇裕仁等细菌战犯必须受审
    京津各界拥护苏提议
    痛斥美帝包庇日本法西斯战犯
    【北京讯】首都各界一致拥护苏联政府审讯日本法西斯细菌战犯的提议，坚决主张严惩日本天皇裕仁等战犯，并痛斥美帝国主义者包庇日本法西斯战犯的罪行。北京市总工会筹委会主任萧明说：我们中国工人和中国人民永远不会忘记日本帝国主义侵略中国的罪行。日本天皇裕仁是发动侵华战争的第一号战犯。苏联远东军事法庭审判日本法西斯细菌战犯的结果证明：日本天皇裕仁就是使用细菌武器残杀中国和苏联人民的组织者。我们坚决拥护苏联政府致我国政府关于主张设立特别国际军事法庭审判战犯裕仁等的照会。苏联政府这一正义的主张，完全符合中国人民和中国工人阶级的意志。对这些穷凶极恶的战犯必须加以惩罚；同时，全世界人民必须团结在苏联的周围反对新战争挑拨者，才能保障劳动人民所创造的成果不再受帝国主义侵略战争的破坏与摧残。我们中国人民身受日寇惨无人道的侵略，进行了八年英勇的抗战，有权主张与参加对战犯裕仁等的审判。我们对美帝国主义包庇战犯裕仁等的罪行提出严重的抗议，要求美帝国主义立即将战犯裕仁等交出加以审判！
    北京市民主青联筹委会副主任杨伯箴说：战犯裕仁和他指使的一批细菌战犯，已经完全灭绝了人性，罪恶滔天，我们完全拥护苏联提出的设立特别国际军事法庭审判裕仁等战犯的主张，坚决反对美帝国主义者包庇战犯的罪恶行为！
    北京市工商联合会筹委会主任傅华亭说：日本帝国主义在侵华的战争罪行中，在东亚的侵略战争中，千百万的和平人民受到惨无人道的残害，对日本帝国主义这笔血债我们永远不会忘记的。我们工商界一致要求严厉制裁这些战犯，但是美国帝国主义者却庇护这些战犯，他们梦想利用这些战犯挑拨新的侵略战争。苏联的提议正是代表全人类对和平的要求。这个提议揭穿了帝国主义战争贩子的阴谋，凡是爱好和平的人民一定拥护这个提议。
    北京市教育工作者工会副主席钱端升说：一大群日本法西斯的细菌战犯在伯力审讯中已招供了他们自己的罪状，并招供了日本裕仁天皇是使用细菌这个罪行的发号施令者。为了惩罚这些穷凶极恶的战犯，警诫新战争的挑拨者，应当早日成立特别国际军事法庭，审讯以裕仁为首的一群战犯，治以应得之罪。所以我们坚决拥护苏联的提议。
    北京市私立医院工会主席邹德馨说：日本帝国主义用细菌作为战争武器，这是一种绝灭人道、违犯国际公法的兽行，是我们全世界人民的仇敌。除了野兽一样的帝国主义和战争贩子自认得意外，全世界所有爱好和平的人都是坚决反对的！现在苏联政府提议审判日本战犯，足以证明苏联是爱好和平的堡垒。我们要坚决站在苏联一面，保卫世界和平，把科学用来创造和平、幸福、自由的世界！
    清华大学教授费孝通说：用细菌来屠杀人民，是违反人道的野蛮行为，而且也违反了国际公法。我们应当感谢苏联把这件旷古未有的日寇犯罪行为揭发出来，使全世界一切爱好和平的人民，都看清楚帝国主义者绝灭人性的真面目。我们有权要求组织特别国际军事法庭来处理这件案子，使所有战犯都得到应得的惩罚，绝不让帝国主义者把这件案子包庇过去。
    北京师范大学教授黎锦熙说：这件事，关系远东，尤其是我们中国人民首先蒙受的毒祸，在当时湖南的常德、东南的敌后地区，已有鼠疫灾害的事实证明。这是中国人民所绝对不应当放过的。为着人道和正义，为着国际公法和世界安全，全世界人民都不会允许宽从这种残酷无比的细菌战争罪犯。我们坚决拥护苏联政府这种合乎人道和正义的行为与主张，坚决要求把一切应得惩处的日本细菌战争罪犯从严审判。
    私立燕京大学代理教务长林汉达说：苏联政府的提议，是完全符合于人类要求的。凡是有正义感和天良的人，都应该拥护这个提议，促其早日实现。苏联已经公审而且判决了准备使用细菌武器的十二个日本罪犯，可是细菌战主要的组织者和鼓励者怎还逍遥法外呢？美国为什么还不发表这种类似的文件呢？麦克阿瑟为什么还包庇人类的公敌呢？学生会主席夏自强说：日本裕仁战犯在美帝麦克阿瑟庇护下继续压迫、麻痹着日本人民，我们对苏联政府正确指出裕仁为战犯首领，并建议设军事法庭审问这些战犯，表示坚决拥护。教育系同学施承斌说：我们要坚决拥护苏联的照会，因为这不只是对战犯应有的惩罚，而且是对战争贩子的一种警诫。
    【本报讯】据新华社电：天津市总工会主任黄火青指出：对于苏联这一提议，天津全体工人竭诚拥护。在抗日战争中，中国人民遭受了最大的苦难；日本帝国主义使用细菌武器，中国人民是直接的牺牲者。我们永远不能忘记这些刽子手的罪行，一定坚决讨还这笔血债！他并表示坚决反对美军占领当局庇护日本战犯的罪恶行为。天津妇联主任罗云说：裕仁命令以毒菌杀人的事实已大白于天下，如果美帝国主义分子再袒护与隐匿这些罪恶滔天的家伙，就要对被害国亿万人民的血债负责！青年团天津市筹委会主任张淮三、天津青联主任何启君也发表谈话，代表全市青年，表示坚决拥护苏联政府的提议，并抗议美帝国主义者对日本战犯的庇护。大学教联主任委员萧采瑜说：帝国主义这种灭绝人性的禽兽行为，决不能让他继续存在人类中间。这些罪行的祸首，也不能让他逍遥法外。美帝国主义一味包庇日本战犯，充分暴露了他挑拨战争的阴谋。北洋大学教授张国藩、启新洋灰公司经理周叔韬等，也一致表示拥护苏联的提议。
