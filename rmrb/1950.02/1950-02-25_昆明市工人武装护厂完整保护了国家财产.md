Xinhua News Agency, Kunming, February 24th:

　　Kunming's public enterprise workers completely protected the property of the people's nation, welcoming the People's Liberation Army into Kunming. Since the peaceful liberation of Yunnan, remnants of the 8th and 26th armies of the Kuomintang had attempted to infiltrate Kunming. During this period, workers in Kunming's public enterprises, in order to protect state property, engaged in heroic struggles to protect factories and property against hidden Kuomintang bandit secret agents and Kuomintang troops attempting to infiltrate Kunming, and achieved victory. The workers of Yunnan and Yudain Spinning Factories, the largest in scale in Yunnan, and their affiliated Yunan Machinery Factory, carried out armed factory protection struggles. At Yunnan Spinning Factory, which was close to the front lines, male workers organized armed forces to fight against the Kuomintang 8th Army; female workers rushed to the front lines to transport ammunition; workers also exposed more than 20 hidden Kuomintang bandit secret agents, preserving their factory. The employees of Yunan Machinery Factory, affiliated with the two factories, buried a motor with more than 200 horsepower underground in the foundry, avoiding sabotage by Kuomintang bandit secret agents. Workers and staff of the famous "53" Arsenal in Southwest China, in order to preserve the factory and avoid bombing and destruction, moved all 249 tons of machinery and more than 2,000 tons of finished products into caves in less than two weeks. At the same time, they organized an armed factory protection force of 500 people. The workers of the Kunming Central Machinery Factory proposed: "Machines are our second life. If the enemy dares to invade, we are determined to fight with our lives." They armed themselves with hammers and iron bars, guarding the machines in shifts, so that the machines were not damaged in the slightest. During the factory protection period, the employees of Kunming Electric Factory organized four brigades to patrol and guard the entire factory area. The employees of Kunming Electric Power Plant, in order to protect the factory, piled up 1,000 sandbags in the workshop overnight, building solid bunkers to protect the two generators. Nearly 1,000 workers in various industries took the lead in organizing the Kunming People's Self-Defense Armed Forces -- the Kunming Volunteer Self-Defense General Team -- during the factory and property protection period. Now Kunming's major factories have been completely preserved and have initially resumed production.

　　昆明市工人武装护厂完整保护了国家财产
    【新华社昆明二十四日电】昆明市公营企业工人，完整地保护了人民国家的财产，迎接人民解放军进驻昆明。自云南和平解放后，残匪第八军、第二十六军曾妄图窜扰昆明。在此时期，昆明市各公营企业的工人，为了保护国家财产和潜伏昆明的残余匪帮特务及妄图进窜昆明的匪军进行了英勇的护厂、护产斗争，并取得了胜利。云南规模最大的云南、裕滇两纺纱厂及其附属的裕南机器厂工人们，进行了武装的护厂斗争。接近前线的云南纺纱厂，男工们组织了武装同匪第八军作战；女工们则奔走火线，输送弹药；工人们并检举了二十多名潜伏的匪帮特务，保全了自己的工厂。两厂附属的裕南机器厂的职工们，把二百多匹马力的马达埋藏在翻砂厂的地下，避免了匪帮特务的破坏。著名西南的“五十三”兵工厂的职工，为了保全工厂，避免轰炸和破坏，不到两周便把重达二百四十九吨的机件与两千多吨成品，全部搬进了窑洞。同时还组织了五百人的护厂武装。昆明中央机器厂的工人们提出：“机器就是第二生命，敌人敢来侵犯，我们就决心用生命去拼。”他们用铁锤、铁杆等武装起来，轮番守卫机器，因此使机器没有受到丝毫破坏。昆明电工厂的职工们，在护厂期间，组织了四个大队，担任整个厂区的巡逻和守卫。昆明电厂的职工，为了保卫工厂，一夜间便在工房内堆好了一千个沙包，筑成坚固堡垒，掩护两部发电机。各业工人近一千人在护厂、护产期间，带头组织了昆明人民的自卫武装--昆明义勇自卫总队。现在昆明的各大工厂，都被完整地保留下来，并已初步恢复了生产。
