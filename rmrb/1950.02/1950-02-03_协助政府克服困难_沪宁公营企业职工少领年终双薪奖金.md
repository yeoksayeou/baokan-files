　　Helping the Government Overcome Difficulties
    Shanghai and Nanjing Public Enterprise Workers Reduce Year-End Double Salary Bonuses
    Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, February 2nd: The year-end bonuses for employees of public enterprises in Shanghai and Nanjing have been distributed according to the handling methods issued by the Financial and Economic Committee of the Government Administration Council. Shanghai began distributing them before the end of last year, and they are expected to be completed before the Spring Festival. The issue of year-end bonuses for workers in larger private enterprises in Shanghai has also been initially resolved. The employees of various public enterprises in Shanghai had a widespread discussion on the handling of year-end bonuses. Generally, they can understand the current difficulties of the country. For example, some workers said: "One carrying pole carries burdens on both ends. Now, when we work, we should not only take care of our own end, but also take care of the country's end." Therefore, after discussions, the employees of various factories wrote to the preparatory committee of the Shanghai Federation of Trade Unions to support the three regulations of the Government Administration Council on the handling of year-end double salaries or bonuses. When each factory stipulated specific distribution methods, the general employees could also take into account the actual situation of their factory. For example, in heavy industry and other enterprises whose production has not yet fully recovered, after joint consultation between the administrative leading organs and the workers, the workers agreed that the annual bonus should not exceed one month at most. During the discussion of the distribution method in each factory, two incorrect opinions also arose: one was that there should be no grading, and everyone should be paid the same; the other was that the actual situation was not taken into account, and it was hoped that the grades would be re-evaluated according to work performance. Both of these opinions were corrected after discussion. After the annual bonus was distributed, many workers enthusiastically bought victory inflation-adjusted public bonds with part or even all of their annual bonus in order to further help the People's Government solve the country's current economic difficulties.
    Method of Annual Bonus for Private Factories to be Resolved Through Labor-Management Consultation
    The method of issuing annual bonuses in Shanghai's private factories is basically resolved through labor-management consultation in accordance with the resolutions of the Second Shanghai Municipal People's Congress. Workers generally can take into account the difficulties of the capitalists. For example, the annual bonuses of the cigarette industry, silk weaving industry, and some small factories with less-than-ideal production conditions have been reduced after joint discussions between labor and management. Shenxin No. 7 Factory had financial difficulties, and the workers proposed not to issue annual bonuses temporarily to help the capitalists overcome the difficulties. However, some private factories had surpluses last year, but they also wanted to reduce workers' annual bonuses, which caused dissatisfaction among the workers. After the workers raised their opinions, they have generally been corrected. At present, the issue of annual bonuses for workers in relatively large private enterprises in Shanghai has been initially resolved.
    Nanjing Public Enterprise Employees Conduct In-Depth Discussions on Handling Year-End Double Salaries or Bonuses
    In Nanjing, the employees of public enterprises also conducted in-depth discussions on the method of handling year-end double salaries or bonuses. After the discussion, the general employees had a clear understanding of the difficulties in the nationwide victory, especially the actual difficulties in Nanjing. Therefore, everyone voluntarily lowered their demands, and generally only received half a month or three-quarters of a month's salary, and donated the rest to the country. Many employees also extracted a portion from the annual bonus they received to donate to disaster relief or purchase public bonds. For example, in addition to collectively purchasing a batch of year-end supplies with the annual bonus, the employees of the Health Equipment Manufacturing Plant of the Central Health Experimental Institute donated the rest to relieve the affected people and purchase public bonds. The employees of the No. 1 Pharmaceutical Factory of the Health Department of the Logistics Department of the Third Field Army donated more than 360,000 yuan of their annual bonus for disaster relief and purchased more than 1.18 million yuan of public bonds.
    Some Factories Experienced Deviations That Were Corrected in a Timely Manner After Review
    In Nanjing, some factories experienced deviations in handling year-end double salaries or bonuses, mainly because the administrative leading organs and the trade unions did not let the workers have democratic discussions freely. For example, the standards and methods for issuing year-end double salaries and bonuses at the Radio Factory were changed several times without full discussion by the employees, which caused dissatisfaction among the workers. Later, the military representative conducted a self-criticism of the undemocratic practice of doing everything on their own, and the administrative side and the workers jointly discussed the issuance standards and methods before making a decision. Some factories also did not pay attention to the actual difficulties of some workers and grasp the emotions of the workers, so some workers had difficulties in their families after enthusiastically donating their annual bonuses. In addition, some workers had egalitarian ideas at the beginning of the discussion, proposing that no matter how much money there was, it should be distributed uniformly and equally, and some proposed that staff and workers should receive the same bonuses, but after repeated discussions in groups, they were corrected in a timely manner.

　　协助政府克服困难
    沪宁公营企业职工少领年终双薪奖金
    【新华社北京二日电】上海、南京两市公营企业职工的年终奖金，已按政务院财经委员会发布的处理办法发放，上海于去年年底前即开始发放，春节前可发放完毕。上海较大私营企业工人的年奖问题，也已初步解决。对于年终奖金处理办法，上海各公营企业职工曾普遍地进行了讨论，一般都能体谅到国家当前的困难，如有的工人说：“一根扁担两头挑，现在我们做事不要光顾自己的一头，也要照顾国家的一头。”因此各厂职工在讨论后，纷纷上书市总工会筹备会拥护政务院关于年终双薪或奖金处理办法的三项规定。各厂在规定具体发放办法时，一般职工也都能照顾本厂的实际情况。如重工业及其他生产尚未完全恢复的企业，经过行政领导机关和工人共同商讨后，工人都赞成年奖最多不超过一个月。在各厂讨论发放办法中，也曾产生两种不正确的意见，一种是不要分等级，大家都一样发法；一种是没有照顾实际情况，希望按工作成绩，重新评定等级。这两种意见都经过讨论，予以纠正。年奖发放后，有许多工人为了进一步帮助人民政府解决国家当前的经济困难，又热情地将年奖的一部甚至全部买了胜利折实公债。
    私营工厂年奖办法劳资双方协商解决
    上海私营工厂发放年奖的办法，基本上是按照沪市二届各界人民代表会议决议，由劳资双方协商解决。工人一般都能照顾资方的困难，如生产情况不十分好的卷烟业、丝织业及一部分小厂，均经劳资双方共同讨论后，减少了年奖；申新七厂资金困难，工人们并提出暂时不发年奖，帮助资方克服困难。但也有些私营工厂去年有盈余，却也要减少工人年奖，因而引起工人不满。经工人们提出意见后，一般都已纠正。现上海比较大的私营企业，工人年奖问题都已初步解决。
    南京公营企业职工对于处理年终双薪或奖金的办法，也曾进行了深入的讨论。讨论后，一般职工对全国胜利中的困难，特别是南京的实际困难都有了明确的认识，因而大家都自愿降低要求，一般均只领半个月或一个月的四分之三，其余全部捐献给国家。有许多职工并从领得的年奖中又抽出一部捐献救灾或购买公债。如中央卫生实验院卫生器材制造厂职工除将年奖集体购买一批年终用品外，其余都捐献救济难胞和购买了公债。第三野战军后勤部卫生部第一制药厂职工将年奖捐献救灾三十六万多元，购买公债一百十八万余元。
    有些工厂发生偏向经过检讨及时纠正
    南京在处理年终双薪或奖金中，有些工厂曾发生偏向，主要是行政领导机关与工会没有放手让工人民主讨论。如无线电厂年终双薪与奖金发放标准和办法，没有经过职工充分的讨论，变更了几次，引起工人的不满。后来经军事代表对不民主的包办作风作了自我检讨，并由行政方面与工人共同讨论了发放标准和办法，然后才作出决定。也有的工厂没有注意有些工人的实际困难和掌握工人的情绪，因而有些工人热情地捐献年奖后，家庭发生了困难。此外有些工厂在开始讨论时，也有部分工人存在着平均主义思想，提出不论钱多钱少，统一平均分配，有的则提出职员和工人应该拿一样的奖金，但经过小组反复讨论，都及时纠正了。
