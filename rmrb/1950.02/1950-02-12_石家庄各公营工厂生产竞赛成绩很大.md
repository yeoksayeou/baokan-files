　　【Report from this newspaper】According to news from the Hebei Daily: The third production competition in Shijiazhuang's state-owned factories, which began in mid-November of last year, concluded in mid-January. This competition benefited from the experience of the previous two competitions, and the movement for democratic management was launched in each factory before the competition. The competition goals (improving technology, improving quality, saving raw materials, and reducing costs) were clear, so greater achievements were made, and the quantity and quality of products in each factory generally improved. For example, the Yumin Match Factory produced 66 boxes of matches per day before the competition, but after the competition, the daily output increased to 83 boxes. The problem of match head detachment was overcome in terms of quality. Fenghang Tobacco Company used to produce 44 cases of cigarettes per day, but now produces 60 cases per day, increasing production by 26.7%. The Yumin Flour Mill originally planned to produce 5,800 bags of flour in two months, but exceeded the plan by 500 bags. The coking plant used to produce 100 tons of coke per day. During the competition, workers carefully studied and improved the technology, and a small kiln could produce an additional 2.7 tons per day.

　　Each factory has made great achievements in reducing costs. Automobile workers at the North China Transportation Company completed the mileage of the past month in ten days during the competition. The factory also developed a method of using anthracite instead of charcoal, which further reduced costs. The Fenghang Tobacco Company's tobacco leaf department reformed the steaming furnace, saving about 12,000 catties of millet in coal and cigarette paper alone. Since the launch of the competition, the cost of water in the Water Company has decreased by 28% compared with October of last year.

　　In the production competition, workers in various factories carefully studied and improved technology to achieve the goals of increasing production and reducing costs. Wang Yunhua, a foundry worker at the Railway Machinery Factory, successfully researched the process of turning raw iron filings into useful materials, saving the factory 30,000 catties of millet each year. Jiang Jianming and Ge Xianzhang of the Transportation Factory successfully used a turning tool to make two openings in the expanded ring, increasing work efficiency tenfold. Wu Zengbao, a worker at the factory, researched a method of using coke to replace lead powder, which reduced the time required to remove the sand core after each hook back casting from 30 minutes to 15 minutes, and also reduced defective products. The workers in the fitter section of Yuhua Machinery Factory turned the washing knife into a double-edged blade, increasing the number of "eccentric shafts" washed from five in two days to five in one day.

　　In addition, in carrying out the production competition, the factories fully promoted democracy, adopted methods such as everyone formulating plans and everyone implementing them, and promptly promoting advanced experience; and formulated various systems, such as inspection systems, reporting systems, and work-hour quota management systems, which are also one of the main reasons for the success of this competition.

　　石家庄各公营工厂生产竞赛成绩很大
    【本报讯】据河北日报消息：石家庄市各公营工厂于去年十一月中旬开始的第三次生产竞赛，已于上月中旬先后结束。这次竞赛由于有以往两次竞赛的经验，竞赛前各厂又开展了管理民主化运动，竞赛目标（改进技术、提高质量、节约原料、降低成本）明确，故取得成绩较大，各厂产品数量质量普遍提高。如裕民火柴厂，竞赛前每日产火柴六十六箱，经过竞赛后每天产量提高到八十三箱。在质量上克服了火柴脱头的现象。风行烟草公司过去日产香烟四十四箱，现在日产六十箱，提高产量百分之二十六点七。裕民面粉厂原计划两个月产面粉五千八百袋，结果超过计划五百袋。炼焦厂过去每天出焦炭一百吨，在竞赛中经过工人细心研究改良技术，一个小窑每天即可多出二·七吨。
    各厂在减低成本上有很大成绩。华北交通公司汽车工人，在竞赛过程中十天完成了过去一个月车行里数。该厂并研究出用石炭代替木炭的办法，进一步减低了成本。风行烟草公司烟叶部改制了蒸烟炉，仅煤炭、盘纸两项，即节省约值小米一万二千余斤。自来水公司自开展竞赛以来，水的成本较去年十月份减低百分之二十八。
    在生产竞赛中，各工厂工人精心钻研改良技术，以达到提高生产减低成本的目的。铁路机厂铸工王云华研究化生铁末成功，使该厂每年可节省小米三万斤。交通工厂蒋剑明、葛宪章用镟刀镟涨圈二次开口，获得成功，工作效率提高十倍。该厂工人吴增保研究用焦炭代替铅粉的办法，使每个勾背铸好后取砂心的时间，由三十分钟减到十五分钟，并减少了废品。裕华机器厂钳工股工人，把洗刀开成两面快刃，使洗“偏心轴”由两天洗五个增到一天洗五个。
    此外，在开展生产竞赛中，各厂充分发扬了民主，采取大家订计划大家执行，及时推广先进经验等办法；并制定各种制度，如检查制、表报制、工时定额管理制等，也是这次竞赛取得成绩的主要原因之一。
