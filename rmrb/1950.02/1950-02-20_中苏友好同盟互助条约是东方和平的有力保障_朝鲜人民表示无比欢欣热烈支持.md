Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 19th: All newspapers here on the 17th devoted the entire front page to publishing the full text of the Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance and two agreements concluded between our government and the Soviet government, as well as the speeches made by Premier Zhou and Vyshinsky at the signing ceremony. Both the *Democratic Korea* and *Rodong Sinmun* newspapers published editorials on the Sino-Soviet treaty.

The *Democratic Korea* newspaper, in an editorial entitled "The Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance and Agreements are a Powerful Guarantee of Peace and Security for the East and World Humanity," wrote: "On February 14th, Moscow announced to the world the joyous news of the conclusion of the Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance between the Soviet Union and China. This is a tremendous historical event." The editorial pointed out that as a result of the Soviet Union defeating Japanese imperialism in the East and the Chinese people achieving a historic victory in establishing their own people's government, the people of the Soviet Union and China have been able to further develop and solidify in the form of a treaty the friendship and unity between the two peoples, which had long been hindered by imperialism and the Kuomintang reactionary government.

The editorial went on to state that the treaty and agreements signed between the Soviet Union and China are of great significance not only for the economic and political development of the Soviet Union and China, but also as a powerful guarantee for peace in the entire East and the world. At a time when American imperialism is plotting to transform Japan into a military base for aggression in the Far East and to support the resurgence of Japanese aggression forces in order to provoke a new war, the signing of this treaty and agreement is indeed an important and great decision. It fully accords with the wishes of freedom-loving people all over the world and is a heavy blow to the adventurous elements of imperialism.

The editorial emphasized that the Korean people warmly care about and welcome the treaties and agreements between the Soviet Union and China, because they are completely in line with the interests of the Korean people. The Korean people's struggle against American imperialism and the Syngman Rhee gang, and for the peaceful reunification of the motherland, will be inspired by this great historical event and further enhance their confidence in victory.

The *Rodong Sinmun*, in an editorial entitled "A Great Event in the History of the People of the East," pointed out: "The further unity of the Soviet Union and China, with a population of 700 million, in the course of struggling for the common interests of mankind, has a significant impact on the enhancement of peace and democratic forces throughout the world and the great cause of Asian peoples striving for national independence. The Korean people express boundless joy and warm support for the signing of the Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance and agreements between our two great neighbors. This is a model of international mutual assistance and solidarity. The Korean people must resolutely unite more closely with our closest friends, the people of the Soviet Union and China, and fight to overthrow the Syngman Rhee puppet government, strive for the reunification of the motherland and world peace and security."
