Relying on Mass Awareness to Grasp the Principle of Fairness
    Jingxing Autumn Grain Collection Completed Ahead of Schedule
    Sufficient investigation and calculation work in advance ensures fair allocation and reasonable reduction and exemption.
    A successful county and district representative meeting mobilizes the people of the county to actively pay public grain.
    Flexible grasp of principles, individual adoption of equivalent exchange.
    [Our Newspaper News] The autumn grain collection work in Jingxing County, Hebei Province, was successfully completed in only twenty days, ten days ahead of schedule. This is the result of the masses having a high degree of political awareness, the leadership being well prepared, the distribution being fair, and disaster relief being reasonable. The masses in the county paid public grain extremely enthusiastically. As soon as the government issued the autumn grain collection call, before the grain depot preparation work was ready, the masses in Wangdagou, Heishuping and other villages automatically delivered grain, which created an important foundation for the rapid completion of the autumn grain collection. The following is a report on the key experiences gained by the county in this autumn grain collection:

    As early as the beginning of September last year, Jingxing County began a typical disaster and crop year survey to prepare for the allocation of autumn grain collection tasks. Jingxing's experience shows that the fairness and reasonableness of autumn grain collection are fundamentally related to taking care of farmers' lives and stabilizing production sentiment. According to the county's situation last year, whether the burden can be fair mainly depends on whether the reduction and exemption for disaster situations are reasonable. The leading organs of Jingxing County paid attention to this issue as early as when making agricultural tax forms last autumn (for example, appropriately increasing the tax exemption point for families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers and widowed elderly without labor who were truly unable to bear the burden, etc.), so that the county had a reliable basis for allocating autumn grain collection to districts and villages according to the disaster and crop year. Secondly, in order to balance the burden on each village, Jingxing, in addition to allocating points based on the land area and yield of each village, also divided different types of villages according to different economic conditions and crop years for research and allocation. For villages bordering between districts, a method of mutual comparison and contrast was adopted. When villages allocated to households, they generally underwent mutual comparison, repeated discussions, and fully promoted the spirit of democratic evaluation. As for the allocation to each household, in many villages throughout the county, disaster-affected households first reported their disaster situation, followed by joint evaluation by democratically elected councilors and village cadres, and finally submitted to a mass meeting for discussion and approval. Xijianshan Village also revised the burden numbers of several households at the final mass meeting. Village cadres in several large villages in the Eighth District went to households to understand the disaster situation and actual affordability, and submitted it to a joint meeting of village representatives and village cadres for discussion: which households should be exempted, which households should be reduced, how many percent of disaster a piece of land suffered, and how many percent of yield should be reduced, and finally decided by a mass meeting, so that every household was satisfied.

    Jingxing's experience also proves that after doing a well-prepared investigation and calculation, holding a successful county and district representative meeting becomes a top priority. The Jingxing County People's Representative Conference was very successful. The government highly respected the opinions of the representatives. The government gave answers to the 335 proposals put forward by the representatives, and immediately put into action those that could be implemented currently, which stimulated the enthusiasm of the representatives. Representatives from each district and village actively discussed the collection tasks of their district and village, and formulated their own plans to help complete the autumn grain collection. The district representative meetings further conducted transmission and discussion based on the specific conditions of their districts. For example, the Eighth District studied how to allocate the collection tasks from village to household fairly and reasonably; the Sixth District specifically discussed how to ensure a certain quality of grain. An even more important achievement of the county and district representative meetings was the active activities of the representatives after returning to their villages, which provided powerful assistance to the development of the autumn grain collection work. For example, Fu Gong, a representative from Beishimen in the Second District, collaborated with primary school teachers and students to publicize the significance of autumn grain collection to farmers after returning to the village. When the village cadres returned to the village from the district to deploy the autumn grain collection, the village's public grain was completely prepared. After Wu Guijin, a female representative from the Fifth District, returned to the village, she also proposed combining grain delivery and ditch digging, with men responsible for ditch digging and women responsible for grain delivery. She personally persuaded women to deliver good grain. Under her influence, most of the village's more than 30,000 jin of public grain was transported by women and successfully completed in two days.

    Jingxing's third experience is that in the distribution of grain seed collection, the principle of taking into account both public and private interests should be grasped, and the principle of equivalent exchange should be adopted individually to solve the problem. In the distribution of grain seed collection, Jingxing, from the county to the district, and from the district to the village, mostly made decisions based on the actual distribution of crops, combined with soliciting the opinions of lower-level cadres and the reflections of farmer representatives. In this way, farmers were levied on what they had, giving farmers great convenience. Zhang Luxiao of Nankangzhuang Village planted eight fen of peanuts. In addition to seeds, he handed in 293 jin, cleared all public grain, and also brought back 45 jin of millet, which had a great impact on the promotion of economic crop planting. Jingxing's experience in distributing grain seeds in the collection proves that if you do not proceed from the actual situation, there will be a mandatory and egalitarian distribution method, which will result in difficulties for farmers to pay. For example, Weidong Street in the Third District did not grow rice, but was allocated rice, resulting in farmers buying rice to pay public grain; if the conversion rate between millet and other grains was not set appropriately in advance, the collection work would also suffer losses. For example, one jin of sesame was converted to one jin and twelve taels of millet. According to the market price at the time, sesame was 800 yuan per jin, and millet was 600 yuan per jin. Farmers could save 200 yuan by handing in one jin of sesame, which would cause losses to the state's financial revenue.

### 依靠群众觉悟掌握公平原则  井陉秋征提前完成

　　依靠群众觉悟掌握公平原则
    井陉秋征提前完成
    事前充分进行调查计算工作，就能做到分配公平、减免合理
    开好县区代表会，发动全县人民踊跃缴纳公粮
    灵活掌握原则，个别采取等价互换
    【本报讯】河北井陉县的秋征工作仅二十天就胜利完成了，较预定时间提早十天。这是群众具有高度的政治觉悟，领导方面准备充分，分配公平，减灾合理的结果。该县群众缴纳公粮至为踊跃，政府刚发出秋征号召，粮库准备工作尚未就绪时，王大沟、黑水坪等村群众即自动送缴，这就造成迅速完成秋征的重要基础。兹将该县在此次秋征中所获的几点重要经验报导如下：
    早在去年九月初，井陉全县就开始了典型的灾情年成调查，作为分配秋征任务的准备。井陉的经验说明：秋征的公平合理，与照顾农民生活、安定生产情绪有着根本的关系。根据该县去年的情况，负担能否公平，主要决定于对灾情的减免是否合理。井陉县的领导机关，早在去秋造农业税表册时就注意了这个问题（如对无劳力的烈军工属及孤寡户实无力负担者，适当提高了免税点等），使得县向区村分配秋征时，就有了按灾情年成分配的可靠根据。其次井陉为了作到各村负担平衡，除了根据各村地亩、产量负担分数以外，还按不同的经济条件和年成，划分了不同的类型村研究分配，在区与区之间的交界村，则采取了互相比较对照的办法。村向户分配时，一般均经过相互对比，反复讨论，充分发扬了民主评议精神。至于各户的分配，全县很多村庄均先由受灾户自报灾情，继由民选的评议员和村干部共同参加评议，最后交群众大会讨论通过，西尖山村在最后的群众大会上还修改了好几户的负担数。八区若干大村庄的村干部，均分头到户了解灾情及实际负担能力，交由村代表与村干部的联席会议讨论：那些户该免，那些户该减，那块地受几成灾，减几成产量，最后再由群众大会讨论决定，结果就能做到家家满意。
    井陉经验又证明，做好有充分准备的调查计算之后，开好县区代表会议，就成为头等重要的事情。井陉县各界人民代表会议开得很成功，政府对代表们的意见极为尊重，政府对于代表们所提三百三十五条提案都分别作了解答，凡当前能实行者，均立即见诸行动，这样就激发了代表们的热情，各区村代表都积极讨论本区村的征收任务，并订出自己帮助完成秋征的计划。各区代表会议更根据本区具体情况进行了传达讨论，如八区就研究了由村向户分配征收任务如何才能公平合理；六区特别讨论了如何保证一定的粮食质量。县区代表会议更重要的成就，是在于代表们回村以后的积极活动，使秋征工作的展开得到有力的帮助。如二区北石门代表傅恭，回村后即协同小学教员、学生向农民宣传秋征的意义，等村干部从区里回村布置秋征时，全村公粮已完全准备妥当。五区女代表吴桂金回村后，还提出缴粮和挑渠相结合，男人负责挑渠，女人担负交粮，她并亲自劝说妇女交好粮食，在她影响下，全村三万余斤公粮，绝大部分均由妇女运交，两天便顺利完成。
    井陉的第三个经验是：在征收粮种的分配上，应当掌握公私兼顾原则个别采取等价互换的原则来解决。在征收粮种的分配上，井陉从县到区，从区到村，绝大部分是根据农作物的实际分配状况，结合征求下层干部的意见和农民代表的反映来作的，如此就做到了农民有什么就征收什么，给了农民群众以极大方便。南康庄村张禄小种了八分花生，除了种子以外，交了二九三斤，交清了全部公粮，还领回来四十五斤小米，这对于推广经济作物的播种有很大的影响。井陉在征收中分配粮种的经验证明：如果不从实际情况出发，就会发生强迫命令的平均主义的分配方法，结果就会造成农民群众缴纳的困难，如三区威东街本来不种稻子，但却分配了大米，结果是农民买了大米交公粮；如事先对于小米和其他粮食的折合率订得不合适，也会使征收工作受到损失。如大麻子一斤折合小米一斤十二两，按当时市价大麻子每斤为八百元，小米每斤为六百元，农民交一斤大麻子就可以便宜二百元，这就使国家财政收入受到损失。
