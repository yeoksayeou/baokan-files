　　Answers to Several Questions Regarding the Municipal Labor Bureau's Trial Implementation Rules for Relief of Unemployed Workers
    [Beijing News] Since the Beijing Municipal People's Government announced the "Beijing Municipal Decision on Relief of Unemployed Workers Trial Implementation Rules" on the 15th of this month, some workers and factory owners still have unclear understandings of the provisions in the rules and the content stipulated in the Beijing Municipal Labor Bureau's announcement for the implementation of these rules. Therefore, this reporter visited Ma Guangdou, Deputy Director of the Labor Bureau, who provided the following answers:
    Question: The Trial Implementation Rules for the Decision on Relief of Unemployed Workers stipulates: "All public and private factories and workshops in this city with ten or more employees must comply with the provisions of these rules." Does this include central government-run factories in Beijing?
    Answer: Yes, it is included.
    Question: Article 2 of the rules stipulates: "Workers in factories and workshops with seasonal production and mobile work (such as coal mines, etc.) are not subject to this method." However, some seasonal factories and workshops, in addition to most of the temporary short-term workers, also have some fixed long-term workers. If these long-term workers number ten or more, can they enjoy this relief?
    Answer: Seasonal and mobile workers do not have a fixed employment relationship with the factory. They gather and disperse according to the season, such as brick kilns and ice cellars; or they have a high degree of mobility due to the nature of production, such as coal mines, etc., and are not subject to these rules. However, if the number of fixed workers in such enterprises is ten or more, the fixed portion should be subject to the provisions of these rules and enjoy relief.
    Question: "When factories and workshops dismiss employees due to production needs, they must pay 30% of the original salary (actual wage) of the dismissed employees to the government as unemployment relief funds for one year after the dismissal." What income is included in this actual wage? How should the payment of this relief fund and relief fund be calculated for those who are paid on a daily basis or on a piecework basis?
    Answer: The wage payment methods in public and private enterprises in this city are not yet unified. In order to take care of the actual income of the dismissed employees, the factory must pay 30% of the original salary of the dismissed employees to the government as relief funds. The payment should be based on the specific wage payment situation of each factory and workshop, including all actual income of the dismissed employees. First of all, the cost of meals provided by the factory should be included. For factories and workers who are paid on a daily basis or on a piecework basis, the payment of relief funds and relief fund can be calculated based on the actual monthly payment or income. The fund paid by workers can be deducted by the factory on a daily basis or on a piecework basis. It should be paid to the government once a month or in two installments as required.
    Question: Item 2 of the Labor Bureau's announcement on relief of unemployed workers stipulates: "In order to simplify procedures, the relief fund to be paid by the workers can be entrusted to the factory of the affiliated unit for handling." Is this relief fund, which is 1% of the monthly salary that active employees should pay, required to be deducted and paid by the factory on a monthly basis?
    Answer: Article 9 of the rules stipulates: "The relief fund must be paid within three days from the original salary payment date, converted into cash at the current millet price." Therefore, the factory deducts and pays the relief fund that workers should pay each month, which not only simplifies the payment procedures, but most importantly, avoids workers from wasting time and suffering unexpected losses during the process of receiving and paying.

　　市府劳动局关于救济失业员工试行细则中几个问题的解答
    【北京讯】北京市人民政府于本月十五日公布“北京市救济失业员工决定试行细则”后，有些工人和厂方对细则中的条文及京市劳动局为执行这一细则的通告中所规定的内容，尚有不甚明了之处，为此，记者特往访劳动局马光斗副局长，承分别解答如下：
    问：救济失业员工决定试行细则中规定：“凡在本市十人以上之公营与私营工厂作坊，均须遵行本细则之规定”，是否包括中央在北京市之公营工厂？
    答：包括在内。
    问：细则第二条规定：“凡属季节性生产之工厂、作坊及流动性工作（如煤矿等）之工人，均不适用此办法”，但有的季节工厂、作坊，除大部分是临时性短工之外，还有些固定性的长工，这些长工如果达十人以上，可否享受此项救济？
    答：季节性和流动性的工人，对厂方来说，不是固定性的雇佣关系，它是因季节而聚散的，如砖窑、冰窖等；或因生产性质而形成流动性很大的，如煤矿等，均不适用本办法。但此种企业中之固定工如在十人以上者，其固定部分则应适用本细则的规定，享受救济。
    问：“各工厂、作坊，为生产需要解雇员工时，在解雇后一年内，须向政府每月交纳其所解雇员工原薪（实际工资）百分之三十作为失业员工救济金”，此项实际工资包括员工那些收入？其他按日计工、以件计工支付工资的，在交纳此项救济金和救济基金时，如何计算？
    答：本市各公私企业中的工资支付形式，在目前还不统一，为了照顾被解雇员工的实际收入，厂方向政府交纳其所解雇员工的原薪百分之三十救济金，须按各工厂作坊支付工资的具体情况，应包括被解雇员工的各项实际收入，首先是由厂方供给伙食的应把饭费计算在内，按日计工及以件计工的厂方和工人，交纳救济金及救济基金时，可按每月实际支付或收入计算，工人所缴基金可由厂方按日或按件代扣。照规定每月一次或分两次向政府交纳。
    问：劳动局关于救济失业员工的通告中第二项规定：“为简化手续，工人方面应缴的救济基金可委托所属单位厂方代为办理”。此项在职员工每月应缴薪金百分之一的救济基金，是否必须由厂方按月负责代扣代交？
    答：细则第九条规定：“交纳救济基金须自原发薪日起三日内按当日小米价格折算现款”，因此，工人每月应缴之救济基金由厂方代扣代交，不仅是简化了交纳的手续，最重要的是避免了工人在领与交的过程中耽误时间和遭受意外的折损。
