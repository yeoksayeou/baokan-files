Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 9th. Luo Bingqian, the chief culprit of the Kuomintang bandit gang special agents who directed enemy aircraft to bombing targets, was executed at Jiangwan execution ground on the 7th with the approval of the Shanghai Military Control Commission. Luo Bingqian joined the Kuomintang Military Statistics Bureau's special agent organization in 1937 and successively held positions in the Zhengzhou Station, Chongqing Headquarters, and Calcutta, India, specifically engaging in counter-revolutionary activities. At the end of August last year, Luo sneaked into Shanghai from Taiwan via the Zhoushan Islands, serving as the leader and station chief of the bandit gang's Shanghai Independent Station, secretly setting up a radio station to report bombing targets to Taiwan. When the Municipal Public Security Bureau captured Luo at the end of last month, it seized a radio station and all confidential documents. With complete evidence, Luo could not deny the charges and confessed that since the end of September last year, he had continuously sent various intelligence reports concerning Shanghai's military, political, economic, and cultural affairs to the bandit gang. He also confessed that at the beginning of January this year, Mao Renfeng instructed him to thoroughly investigate and report the names, locations, production conditions, and bombing targets of state-owned and private heavy industrial factories within our East China region. Several enemy aircraft bombings were related to the intelligence provided by this bandit. The city's people are universally applauding this death sentence.

　　沪破获供给匪机轰炸目标案
    匪帮特务罗炳乾伏法
    【新华社上海九日电】为匪机指示轰炸目标的国民党匪帮特务首恶罗炳乾，经上海市军管会批准，已于七日在江湾刑场伏法。罗匪炳乾于一九三七年即参加国民党军统局特务组织，历在军统郑州站、重庆总台及印度加尔各答等地任职，专门从事反革命活动。去年八月底，罗匪自台湾经舟山群岛潜来上海，任匪帮上海独立台组长兼台长，密设电台，向台湾报告匪机轰炸目标。本市公安局上月底捕获罗匪时，搜出电台一部，密本等证件全部。因人证物证俱全，罗匪无从狡赖，乃供认自去年九月底起，陆续向匪帮拍送有关上海军政财经文教的各项情报。并供认今年一月初，毛匪人凤嘱其将我华东区内公私营重工业工厂名称、地点、生产情况及轰炸目标等全盘确切查明报告。匪机数度轰炸，多与该匪情报有关。此次判处死刑，全市人民莫不称快。
