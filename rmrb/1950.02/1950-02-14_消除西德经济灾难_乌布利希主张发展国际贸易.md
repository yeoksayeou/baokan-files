Xinhua News Agency, Berlin (TASS dispatch): Deputy Prime Minister of the German Democratic Republic, Ulbricht, stated on the 9th, during a plenary session of the Provisional People's Chamber, in response to the inquiry from the Free Democratic Party parliamentary group regarding "What opportunities should the government provide to the impoverished and unemployed people of West Germany?" that Western countries are systematically reducing West German production and stifling West German foreign trade. Many goods, such as synthetic rubber, fuel, and celluloid, are prohibited from being produced. The loans that the Americans are giving to their West German protectorate are the most disastrous, and the West German people must pay for them with occupation fees, the Ruhr Statute, and unemployment.

Ulbricht emphasized that only by rebuilding a unified and democratic Germany can the economic situation in the Western zone be fundamentally changed. To this end, the struggle of the National Front should be intensified to the maximum extent. The practical steps to reduce unemployment in West Germany must first help develop international trade and abandon the interests of the agents of American monopoly capital. All those who serve the American and British imperialists must be denounced.

Ulbricht finally declared: "The faster the German Democratic Republic becomes stronger, the better the national economic plan is implemented, the sooner a unified Germany without crisis or unemployment will appear."

　　消除西德经济灾难
    乌布利希主张发展国际贸易
    【新华社北京十三日电】塔斯社柏林讯：德意志民主共和国副总理乌布利希，九日在临时人民议会全体会议上答复自由民主党议会党团所提“政府应对西德的贫困失业的人民提供何种机会”的询问时称：西方国家正在有系统地减缩西德生产，并窒息西德的对外贸易。多种货品如人造橡皮、燃料及赛璐璐等，都被禁止生产。美国人给予其西德保护地的贷款，是最具灾难性的，西德人民必须为它们付出占领费用、鲁尔法规及失业的代价。
    乌布利希强调称：只有重建统一的民主的德国，才能根本改变西区的经济情势。为此，全国阵线的斗争，应该加强到最大限度。减少西德失业的实际步骤，首先必须帮助发展国际贸易，并抛弃美国垄断资本代理人的利益。必须痛斥一切为美英帝国主义者服务的人。
    乌布利希最后宣称：“德意志民主共和国强大得愈快，国民经济计划执行得愈好，一个既无危机也无失业的统一的德国，也就会愈快地出现。”
