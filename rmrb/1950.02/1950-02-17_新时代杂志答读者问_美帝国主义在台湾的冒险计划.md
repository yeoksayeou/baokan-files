The Adventurous Plans of American Imperialism in Taiwan

A large part of China has been liberated. The armed forces of the People's Republic of China are about to finally annihilate the remaining troops of the Kuomintang. However, the Kuomintang warlords are still struggling to delay this inevitable outcome. After being defeated on the Chinese mainland, the Kuomintang reactionaries are now preparing to continue fighting the Chinese people on Chinese islands (mainly Taiwan) with the help of their American masters.

A strait 120 to 300 meters wide separates Taiwan from the southern coast of China. Taiwan and its nearby Penghu Islands have a total area of approximately 36,000 square meters. The population is 6.5 million, mainly Chinese who migrated from Fujian and Guangdong provinces.

Taiwan is an inseparable part of China, and it has close historical, economic, and cultural ties with China. The first Chinese immigrants arrived in Taiwan as early as the 15th century. Taiwan became part of China in 1683.

During the Sino-Japanese War of 1894-95, Taiwan and the Penghu Islands were annexed by Japan. For half a century, Japanese monopoly capitalists plundered Taiwan's natural resources (coal, petroleum, bauxite, gold mines) and oppressed the residents of Taiwan. Uprisings against Japanese rule occurred constantly on the island. The struggle against foreign colonists had a particularly large scale between 1912 and 1915. Another major riot occurred in 1930. However, it was not until Japan surrendered in World War II that its rule in Taiwan ended. We know that the Potsdam Declaration stipulates that Japan's sovereignty is limited to the Japanese islands proper.

However, the appearance of Kuomintang officials in Taiwan did not improve the difficult fate of the local residents. Kuomintang tycoons descended on Taiwan's resources like locusts. The island's food and industrial products were shipped to mainland China. Many factories and mines closed down, unemployment increased, and inflation reached disastrous levels.

As usual in Kuomintang China, a regime of unlimited military police dictatorship was established on the island. Arrogant Kuomintang officials treated the island's residents with extreme rudeness, did not allow Taiwanese to hold important government positions, and banned the local dialect. The mass uprising against Chiang Kai-shek's tyranny in February 1947 was brutally suppressed by troops, tanks, and aircraft. More than 10,000 patriots were killed, and tens of thousands were thrown into prisons and concentration camps.

Now, the United States is trying to arbitrarily turn Taiwan into its colony. American businessmen have signed many treaties with the Kuomintang to jointly develop Taiwan, and the result has been to put the island's economy completely under the control of foreigners. Under the protection of the Kuomintang rulers, Leonard Hardware Company (an aluminum concern), Westinghouse Electric Company, and other American companies have established a firm foothold on the island. Many power stations, sugar refineries, and other industrial plants have fallen into the hands of Americans.

At the same time, the United States has taken measures to turn Taiwan into an American naval base. The ports of Kaohsiung, Tainan, Keelung, and Tamsui have become anchorages for the US Pacific Fleet. The US Air Force has taken control of the airports in Taipei, Taichung, Tainan, Kaohsiung, and Pingtung.

Today, the Kuomintang group regards Taiwan as their last foothold. Tens of thousands of troops were transported there at the end of 1948. With the help of American advisors, large military training centers have been established on the island. At the beginning of 1949, the headquarters of the Kuomintang Navy and Air Force also moved to Taiwan. Storage depots for American weapons and equipment have been established, and huge armed forces have been concentrated on the island.

The Kuomintang authorities have recruited a large number of Japanese experts to build strategic facilities. What is even more serious is that in the middle of 1949, a large number of former Japanese Konoe troops soldiers and officers were re-enlisted with the assistance of General MacArthur, preparing to fight for Taiwan.

The bankrupt Kuomintang group's bandits and Chinese war criminals have taken Taiwan as their refuge. The Chen brothers, Yan Xishan, Wu Guozhen, and many other notorious Kuomintang locusts and reactionaries fled there. Various departments of the Kuomintang government, national archives, and gold as national reserves have also been moved to the island. Chiang Kai-shek's office retreated to Taiwan last autumn. After being driven out of Chongqing and Chengdu, the Kuomintang has declared Taipei as their new capital.

The influx of Kuomintang bureaucrats and warlords, as well as the plunder and lawlessness of Yan Xishan's "government," have completely destroyed the island's economy. Industry has been destroyed, and hunger is rampant. Taiwan's total industrial output last year was only 40 percent of pre-war levels. Among the 300 machine manufacturing industries, one-third have closed down, and the rest are on the verge of collapse. Taiwan's most developed industry, sugar production, has virtually come to a standstill. Kuomintang executioners have established a sinful reign of terror on the island.

According to Reuters, Chiang Kai-shek's military conference in Taipei last month decided to establish a staff headquarters on the island to direct operations against the People's Liberation Army "on land, at sea, and in the air." Kuomintang heavy bombers based in Taiwan violently attacked Chinese cities. Taiwan's ports are used as bases for the remnants of the Kuomintang Navy, and the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang is attempting to use them to blockade the ports of the People's Republic and launch pirate-like attacks on merchant and passenger ships sailing in the South China Sea and the East China Sea.

American expansionists are launching a campaign to continue to aid the Kuomintang, even to the point of almost direct military intervention. Former President Hoover and Senator Taft have called on Truman to "defend" Taiwan with the navy. At the same time, the United States is openly clamoring for the annexation of Taiwan. Monopoly newspapers suddenly discovered that Taiwan is still in an "uncertain" state because a peace treaty with Japan has not yet been concluded. Therefore, it can be assumed that Taiwan is "part of Japanese territory" and should be controlled by the US military. Those who instigated this movement have obviously forgotten the decisions of the Cairo Conference, according to which Taiwan has been officially returned to China.

US Congressman La Follette maliciously stirred up sentiment for the annexation of Taiwan, declaring on the 3rd of last month:

"If we do not occupy Taiwan now, we may have to sacrifice many American lives to do so later."

MacArthur was particularly brazen in clamoring for the annexation of Taiwan. He regarded the island as "an indivisible part of his Far East Pacific defense system" and suggested that the United States unceremoniously take it as "spoils of war."

On January 5, Truman made a special statement on Taiwan. He said that the US government did not intend to occupy Taiwan or establish military bases there, nor did it intend to give Chiang Kai-shek "military assistance or advice" – all the United States wanted to do was provide economic assistance in accordance with the Marshall Plan.

Secretary of State Acheson gave a tell-tale explanation of these peaceful sweet words. He said that the issue of military assistance to Chiang Kai-shek would not arise because "the Kuomintang's difficulties in Taiwan are not military materials – the Kuomintang has that." But, he continued, "there is no reason why the Kuomintang cannot hire American reserve troops and officers." And also purchase American weapons and military equipment.

Despite Truman's sweet assurances, Chiang Kai-shek and his American masters had already concluded a secret military agreement in mid-November last year. According to China's Xinhua News Agency, the treaty stipulates that the United States will supply the Kuomintang with weapons and equipment for five divisions, sixteen warships, radar equipment, and aircraft parts. In addition, it allows the Kuomintang to receive an additional $150,000,000 in financial assistance.

On the Kuomintang side, it is necessary to organize a "government" according to Washington's instructions, allow American military missions to come to Taiwan, and obtain the right to fully control Taiwan's military, political, and economic affairs. The treaty stipulates that if the Kuomintang's military plan fails, the United States will directly occupy Taiwan.

Simultaneous with this treaty, the US Congress gave Chiang Kai-shek $75,000,000 for "defending" Taiwan. The Marshall Plan Bureau also allocated an additional loan of $10,000,000 in the name of "developing Taiwan's industry." On December 29, the heads of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff recommended that the government send another batch of military and non-military advisors to Taiwan. According to newspaper reports, Truman and the National Security Council fully agreed with this recommendation.

According to Agence France-Presse's report on December 29, many American "retired" officers have arrived in Taiwan to serve as military advisors. It is also reported that the United States is strengthening its Seventh Task Force stationed in the Western Pacific. The aircraft carrier "Boxer" and two destroyers are heading to the region to "stabilize the situation." A large amount of military equipment is also being shipped to Taiwan. According to American and British newspapers, the Turkish steamer "Martin" loaded two hundred tanks and armored vehicles in Philadelphia on January 10 and set sail for Taipei.

It can be seen from this that the American rulers are rudely violating their international obligations – in this matter, they are not only violating the Potsdam Agreement, but also the Cairo Agreement. Washington has openly adopted a policy of forcibly separating Taiwan from China, turning Taiwan into an American colony, and making it a base for armed confrontation with the People's Republic of China and the growing national liberation movement of the people of Southeast Asia.

These plans of the American imperialists have deeply angered the Chinese people. The broad masses of the Chinese people – various political parties, public organizations, factory workers, and office staff – strongly protested the illegal treaties concluded by the Kuomintang reactionaries and imperialism. The Shanghai Ta Kung Pao said on January 5:

"Such rampant, ferocious, and openly unscrupulous imperialist behavior can be compared to Japan's invasion of Northeast China, Mussolini's attack on Abyssinia, and Hitler's annexation of Austria and Czechoslovakia."

The residents of Taiwan are also strongly opposed to any aggression against Chinese territory. The leader of the Taiwan Democratic Self-Government League recently declared:

"Taiwan has always been a part of China, and the people of Taiwan are a part of the Chinese nation. The people of Taiwan will do everything possible to help the People's Liberation Army liberate Taiwan."

Despite the Kuomintang's establishment of a bloody reign of terror, the liberation movement in Taiwan is growing. Thousands of Taiwanese patriots are engaged in organized guerrilla warfare. The position of the Kuomintang invaders in Taiwan is becoming increasingly unstable. They do not even trust the officials within their own government and implement a system of mutual responsibility. Air Force personnel without relatives as guarantors are not allowed to load enough fuel to fly to mainland China. Recently, an order was issued – ships defending the coast are not allowed to leave the port alone, they must be in pairs, and the people on each ship must be responsible for ensuring that the other ship returns.

"The glorious combat tasks of the Chinese People's Liberation Army and the Chinese people in 1950" – the New Year's message from the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China to the officers and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army and the people of the whole country said – "are to liberate Taiwan, Hainan Island, and Tibet, annihilate the last remnants of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, complete the cause of unifying China, and not allow American imperialist aggressive forces to have any foothold on our territory."

Facts have shown that the actions of the Chinese Communists are completely in line with what they say. The day when the People's Republic of China establishes its regime without exception throughout the country is not far away.

    美帝国主义在台湾的冒险计划
    中国的一大部分已被解放了。中华人民共和国的武装即将最后歼灭国民党的残余部队。但是，国民党军阀们还在挣扎着企图延缓这一不可避免的结局。国民党反动集团在中国大陆上被打败之后，现在正准备借其美国主子的援助继续在中国海岛（主要是台湾）上和中国人民作战。
    一个宽达一百二十至三百公尺的海峡把台湾和中国南海岸隔了开来。台湾及其附近的澎湖列岛共有面积约三万六千方公尺。人口六百五十万，其中主要的是从福建和广东两省移殖来的中国人。
    台湾是中国的不可分割的一部分，它和中国有着紧密的历史的、经济的和文化的联系。第一批中国移民早在十五世纪便来到了台湾。台湾在一六八三年已成为中国的一部分了。
    在一八九四——九五年的中日战争期间，台湾和澎湖列岛被日本所吞并。半世纪以来，日本独占资本家便一直掠夺台湾的天然富源（煤、石油、铁矾土、金矿）和压迫台湾的居民。岛上曾不断发生过反对日本统治的暴动。在一九一二至一九一五年期间，反对异国殖民者的斗争，具有特别广泛的规模。一九三○年又发生了另一次大的暴动。但是，直到日本在第二次世界大战中投降时，它在台湾的统治才告结束。我们知道，波茨坦宣言规定：日本的主权只限于日本岛屿本土。
    然而，国民党官员们在台湾的出现丝毫没有改善当地居民的艰苦命运。国民党富豪们像蝗虫一样栖落在台湾的资源上。该岛的粮食和工业品被运到中国大陆去。许多工厂和矿山倒闭了，失业增长了，通货膨胀达到灾难性的程度。
    像通常在国民党中国一样，一个无限制的军事警察专制的政权在岛上建立起来。傲慢的国民党官吏们以极端的无礼对待岛上居民，不允许台湾人充任政府要职，禁用本地方言。一九四七年二月发生的反对蒋介石暴政的群众性的暴动，受到军队、坦克和飞机的惨酷的镇压。一万多爱国者被杀，数万人被投入监狱和集中营。
    现在，美国企图专横地将台湾变为它的殖民地。美国商人已经和国民党签订了许多共同开发台湾的条约，其结果已使该岛经济完全掌握在外国人的控制之中。在国民党统治者的保护下，雷纳德五金公司（一个铝业康采恩）、威斯丁豪斯电业公司和其他美国公司已在该岛建立起稳固的地位。许多电力站、炼糖厂和其他工业工厂已落入美国人之手。
    与此同时，美国已采取了把台湾变为一个美国海军基地的措施。高雄、台南、基隆和淡水诸港口已成为美国太平洋舰队的停泊站。美国空军已统辖了台北、台中、台南、高雄和屏东的飞机场。
    今天，国民党集团把台湾当作他们的最后立足地。数万军队已于一九四八年年底运到那里去。在美国顾问帮助下，大的军事训练中心在岛上建立起来。一九四九年初，国民党海军和空军总部也迁移到台湾。美国武器和军备的储藏库建立起来了，巨大的武装力量集中到岛上来。
    国民党当局招来了大批日本专家以建造战略设备。尤有甚者，一九四九年年中，大批日本前近卫部队的士兵和官吏在麦克阿瑟将军协助下又被编集入伍，准备为台湾作战。
    破产的国民党集团的匪首们和中国战犯们把台湾当作他们的避难所。陈氏弟兄、阎锡山、吴国桢以及其他许多臭名昭彰的国民党蝗虫们和反动家伙们逃到那里。国民党政府各部门，国家的档案和作为国家准备金的黄金，也都被搬到岛上去。蒋介石的办公厅于去年秋天已撤退到台湾。国民党被从重庆和成都驱逐出去以后，已宣布台北为他们的新首都。
    国民党官僚和军阀们的蜂涌而来，以及阎锡山“政府”的掠夺与无法无天，已彻底破坏了该岛的经济。工业被破坏，饥饿盛行。台湾去年的工业总产量仅为战前的百分之四十。在三百个机器制造业中，三分之一已停业，其余的也濒于倒闭。台湾最为发达的工业之一的制糖业实际上陷于停顿状态。国民党刽子手们在该岛上建立了罪恶的恐怖统治。
    据路透社报道，上月蒋介石在台北召开的军事会议曾决定在该岛建立一个参谋部以指导“在陆上、海上和空中”对人民解放军的作战。以台湾为基地的国民党重轰炸机狂暴地袭击中国城市。台湾的港口被用作国民党海军残余的基地，蒋介石匪帮并企图用它们来封锁人民共和国的港口，并且由那里向航行于中国南海和东海的商船和客船进行海盗式的袭击。
    美国扩张主义者正在展开一个继续援助国民党的运动，甚至于几乎出之于直接的军事干涉。前总统胡佛和参议员塔佛脱曾吁请杜鲁门用海军“保卫”台湾。同时，美国正公开地发出吞并台湾的叫嚣。垄断家的报纸突然发现：台湾还处在“不确定的”状态中，因为，对日和约还没有缔结。由此，也就可以假定台湾是“日本领土的一部分”，而且应该由美国军队管制。挑起这一运动的人们显然是连开罗三国会议的决定都忘记了，根据这个决定，台湾已正式地交还给中国。
    美国国会议员劳佛乐恶意地为了激起吞并台湾的情绪，曾于上月三号宣称：
    “我们现在若不进占台湾，以后也许必得牺牲许多美国人的生命来这样做。”
    麦克阿瑟在嚷着并吞台湾时是特别厚颜无耻的。他把该岛看作“他的远东太平洋防御体系的不可分割的一部分，”并建议美国不客气地把它当作“战利品”拿去。
    一月五日，杜鲁门特别作了一次关于台湾的声明。他说，美国政府既不打算占领台湾或在那里建立军事基地，也不打算给蒋介石以“军事援助或建议”——美国所要做的一切只是依照马歇尔计划给以经济的援助。
    艾奇逊外长对于这些和平的甘言蜜语却作了泄露天机的解释。他说，以军事援助蒋介石的问题不会发生，因为“国民党在台湾的困难不是军事物资——国民党有那个。”但是，他继续说，“国民党为什么不能雇用美国预备军和军官却是没有道理的。”并且还有购买美国的武器和军事装备。
    尽管杜鲁门作了甜蜜的保证，而蒋介石及其美国主子早在去年十一月中旬便已缔结了军事秘密协定。据中国新华社称，该条约规定美国供给国民党五个师的武器和装备，十六只军舰、雷达装置和飞机零件等。此外还允许给国民党一五○、○○○、○○○美元的额外的财政援助。
    而在国民党方面，则要按照华盛顿的指示组织“政府”，和允许美国军事使团来台湾，并取得完全掌握台湾军事、政治和经济事务的权利。条约规定，如果国民党的军事计划失败，则美国便直接占领台湾。
    与此条约同时，美国国会给予蒋介石七五、○○○、○○○元作为“保卫”台湾之用。马歇尔计划局也在“发展台湾工业”的名义下额外地拨了一○、○○○、○○○元的贷款。十二月二十九日，美国联合参谋部的头子们建议政府派遣另一批军事的和非军事的顾问到台湾。据报纸披露，杜鲁门和国家安全委员会完全同意这项建议。
    据法新社十二月二十九日的报道，许多美国“退伍”军官已抵达台湾充任军事顾问。又据悉美国正在增强其停泊在西太平洋的第七工作舰队。“拳士号”航空母舰和两艘驱逐舰正驰往该地区以“稳定局势”。大量军备也正被运往台湾。据美国和英国的报纸报道，土耳其的汽船“马丁号”于一月十日在费城装载了二百辆坦克和装甲车开往台北。
    由此可见，美国统治者又在粗鲁地破坏其国际义务——在这件事情上不仅是破坏了波茨坦协定，而且还破坏了开罗协定。华盛顿已公然采取以强力分离台湾和中国，把台湾变成美国的殖民地，以及使之成为武装对抗中华人民共和国与正在增长的东南亚人民民族解放运动的基地的政策。
    美帝国主义者的这些计划深深地激怒了中国人民。广大的中国群众——各政党、各公共团体、工厂工人和机关工作人员——强烈地抗议国民党反动派和帝国主义缔结的不法条约。一月五日的上海大公报说：
    “这样张牙舞爪穷凶极恶公然行之而无忌的帝国主义行为，可与日本侵略东北，墨索里尼进攻阿比西尼亚，及希特勒并吞奥大利、捷克等媲美。”
    台湾居民也同样强烈地反对对中国领土的任何侵略。台湾民主自治同盟的领袖最近宣称：
    “台湾从来就是中国的一部分，台湾人民是中华民族的一部分。台湾人民将尽一切努力帮助人民解放军解放台湾。”
    尽管国民党建立了血腥的恐怖统治，台湾的解放运动却在增长着。数千个台湾爱国者已在进行有组织的游击战争。国民党侵占者在台湾的地位越来越不稳固了。他们甚至连他们自己政府内的官吏也不相信，而实行了一种互相负责的制度。没有亲属作抵押的空军不得装载足以飞行到中国大陆去的燃料。最近又颁布了一道命令——防守海岸的船只不准单独出港，必须是两两一起，而每一只船上的人必须负责使另一只船只返回。
    “中国人民解放军和中国人民在一九五○年的光荣战斗任务”——中国共产党中央委员会的新年告人民解放军将士与全国人民书说——“就是解放台湾、海南岛和西藏，歼灭蒋介石匪帮的最后残余，完成统一中国的事业，不让美国帝国主义侵略势力在我们的领土上有任何立足点。”
    事实已表明中国共产党人的行动和他们说的话完全相符。中华人民共和国毫无例外地在全国各地建立起其政权的日子已为时不远了。
                              （古罗夫著·镜澄译）
