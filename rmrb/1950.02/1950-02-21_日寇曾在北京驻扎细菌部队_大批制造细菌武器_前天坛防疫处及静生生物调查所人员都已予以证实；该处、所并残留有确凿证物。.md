Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, February 20th: It has been confirmed here that the Japanese invaders stationed a bacteriological warfare unit in Beijing and established a "Bacteriological Weapon Research Institute" to produce large quantities of bacteriological weapons. Former personnel of the Beijing Temple of Heaven Epidemic Prevention Center (now the Central Epidemic Prevention Experimental Center) and the Jing Sheng Biological Investigation Institute have all testified that the Japanese invaders stationed a bacteriological warfare unit, the "North China Detachment 1855," in Beijing. Their reports on the unit's situation are completely consistent with the situation of the unit revealed by Matsui Jikan, a medical orderly of the Shinoda Unit of the unit, in the Japanese Communist Party Central Committee's newspaper, Akahata, on January 10th. The former Temple of Heaven Epidemic Prevention Center recently discovered six tubes of special bacterial strains labeled with Japanese women's names, left behind by the unit. After cultivation and inoculation, they were proven to be highly virulent plague bacilli.

The Jing Sheng Biological Investigation Institute building is located west of the National Beijing Library, with three floors above ground and a basement, totaling more than 60 rooms. The third floor is mostly a platform. After the outbreak of the Pacific War, the Shinoda Unit occupied the institute on December 9, 1941. After the Japanese invaders surrendered, Xia Weikun and others who took over the institute found a studio instruction diagram left by the Second Section of the Shinoda Unit in the basement, proving that the institute was a place for mass breeding of fleas. The diagram stated: "Normally, only the western half of the second floor is used for breeding fleas. During wartime, the entire second and third floors can be used for breeding fleas. The maximum production capacity during wartime is 24,700 watts. The most suitable number of fleas for normal breeding is 1,600 watts." In addition, a chart of the "relationship between flea larvae feed and adult emergence" was found in the same location, as well as photographs of fleas, rats, mosquitoes, and flies collected by the unit in various places. The institute's old workers, Men Zihua and Gao Wenyuan, said that when the Shinoda Unit occupied the institute, no Chinese person was allowed to go to the second floor. At the top of the stairs leading to the second floor, two doors were installed, which were always locked. When the Japanese went up, they had to take off their clothes and ring the doorbell before being allowed in. Whenever large trucks drove into the institute, they were tightly covered, and after entering the gate, the Japanese soldiers immediately closed the gate and blocked the Chinese workers in the backyard, not even allowing them to leave after work. When the unit's commander, Nishiura Eiji, came, he also blocked the Chinese workers in the backyard, with strict security. The temperature in the building was usually very high, and the heating boiler was only stopped for one month in July each year. There were three circular lawns with a diameter of six meters, surrounded by cement ditches in the yard. The Japanese soldiers told the Chinese workers not to approach, saying that the lawns were sprinkled with fleas. The Japanese soldiers crushed many dried blood clots into blood powder every day. According to the description on the research chart left by the unit, blood powder was a kind of feed for raising fleas. Gao Wenyuan was responsible for feeding thousands of white rats, gray rats, hamsters, rabbits, and other animals. He also picked up a batch of Shandong rats at the station and collected a large number of flies from various district offices in Beijing. After the Japanese surrendered, the unit drove all the Chinese workers out and secretly burned various documents and equipment, and dismantled various facilities. Within ten days after the surrender, Men Zihua was called back to repair the water pump and saw Japanese soldiers burying the green glass that they had installed on the second floor after smashing it, replacing it with ordinary glass. After the Japanese left, the institute also found seven or eight large glass bottles, more than a foot high, all filled with things like flies. When repairing the water pipes, more than twenty broken kerosene barrels and burnt barley and rats were dug up in the underground. The bacteriological warfare unit also built a small windowless house of four meters square with double doors, and an underground cold storage room, all for cultivating bacteriological weapons.

The Temple of Heaven Epidemic Prevention Center was located in the southwest of the Temple of Heaven, which is now the address of the Central Epidemic Prevention Experimental Center. When the Japanese invaders occupied it, it was connected to the North China People's Hospital to the south. The Japanese invaders built many houses there. Besides the dormitories and wards, there were about 100 workshops. Tang Feifan, the former director of the Temple of Heaven Epidemic Prevention Center, said: "When I took over the Temple of Heaven Epidemic Prevention Center occupied by 'North China Detachment 1855' after the Japanese invaders surrendered in 1945, I asked if there were any toxic bacterial strains. The Japanese said that there were only typhus bacterial strains, so they only handed over typhus bacterial strains. However, after the establishment of the bacterial strain room this year, when collecting the bacterial strains from various departments of the center, six tubes of bacterial strains only marked with the names of Japanese women were found. The first was Sugita Kōhei, the second was Sugita Akiko, the third was Sugita Takako, the fifth was Nagae Katsuko, the sixth was Sugita Yoshiko, and the eighth was Iwatani Fumiyo. After culturing and testing the six tubes of bacterial strains, it was found that five of them were virulent plague bacilli, and the virulence of the eighth may have disappeared. This is one of the most powerful evidences to prove that the Japanese invaders manufactured bacteriological weapons there." In addition, there were three large disinfection pots, each six meters long with eleven-ton, twelve-ton, and thirteen-ton capacity, left by the Japanese invaders in the yard of the former Temple of Heaven Epidemic Prevention Center, which were used to disinfect the equipment for cultivating bacterial strains. A large number of aluminum culture boxes were also stored in the warehouse. According to Chen Kangyan, a mechanic who worked in the unit at the time, the Japanese invaders not only destroyed many documents and equipment after the surrender, but also used tanks to crush or burn a large number of aluminum culture boxes. He also said that when the Japanese were here, two workers were specifically assigned to brush kerosene barrels and open the lids every day. A large number of these prepared kerosene barrels were sent to the Jing Sheng Biological Investigation Institute by trucks. The scale of the small animal room for culturing animals was also extremely large, with four rows of houses, totaling about 70 rooms, each of which could house hundreds or even a thousand rats. The Japanese invaders used sacks to transport large quantities of blood powder, which was used as a bacterial culture agent. To this day, the underground north of the People's Hospital is still buried with the blood powder left over by the Japanese invaders, and it still has a fishy odor when it rains.

　　日寇曾在北京驻扎细菌部队
  　大批制造细菌武器     
    前天坛防疫处及静生生物调查所人员都已予以证实；该处、所并残留有确凿证物。
    【新华社北京二十日电】此间人士已证实日寇曾在北京驻扎细菌部队，并设有“细菌兵器培养所”，制造大批细菌武器。前北京天坛防疫处（现中央防疫实验处）、静生生物调查所人员，都证明日寇曾在北京驻扎过细菌部队“北支甲一八五五部队”。他们所报告该部队的情况，与该部队筱田队卫生兵松井治宽一月十日在日共中央机关报《赤旗报》上所揭露的该部队情况完全符合。前天坛防疫处最近并已发现该部队残留的六管标着日本女人名字的特别菌种，经过培养接种后，证明全是毒性很大的鼠疫杆菌。
    静生生物调查所大楼位于国立北京图书馆的西邻，除地下室外，共有三层，有房六十多间。第三层大部是平台。筱田部队在太平洋战争爆发后，在一九四一年十二月九日进占该所。日寇投降后接管该所人员夏纬琨等，曾在该所地下室内发现该筱田部队第二课所留下的一张工作室说明图，证明该所为大量培养蚤种场所，图上注明：“平时只二层楼西半部养蚤种，作战时二、三层楼可全部养蚤。作战时最大生产能量是二万四千七百瓦。平常养蚤最合适的数量是一千六百瓦。”此外，同一地方还发现了“蚤幼虫期的饲料和成虫发生量的关系”的图表，以及该部队在各地所搜集的跳蚤、老鼠、蚊蝇的像片。该所老工人门子华、高文元说，筱田部队占据该所时，二层楼上是不许任何中国人上去的。在上二层楼的楼梯顶端，按了两扇门，日常总是锁着。日本人上去时，也要脱了衣服，按电铃后，才许进去。每逢有大卡车开到所里时，卡车都是严密遮盖，而且开进大门后，日本兵就马上关起大门，并把中国工人堵在后院，连下班都不许出去。该部队部队长西村英二来时，也是把中国工人都堵在后院，严密戒备。楼里平时温度很高，每年只七月份停烧暖气锅炉一个月。院子里有用洋灰沟围起的三块直径六米的圆草地。日本兵嘱咐中国工人不许靠近，说草地里撒有跳蚤。日本兵每天把许多干血块碾成血粉。按照该部队残留的研究图表的说明，血粉是养跳蚤的一种饲料。高文元曾负责喂几千只白鼠、灰鼠、仓鼠、兔子等物。他还到车站接过一批山东老鼠，到北京各区公所收集过大量的苍蝇。日本投降后，该部队把中国工人都赶了出去，秘密烧毁各项文件、器具，拆毁各项设备。在投降后的十天内，门子华被叫回去修理水泵，看见日本兵正把他们按装的二楼绿色玻璃都打碎了埋到地下，换上普通玻璃。日本人走了以后，该所还发现了七八个一尺多高的大玻璃瓶，里面都满装着苍蝇一类的东西。该所在修理水管时，曾在地下挖出二十几个破煤油桶和烧过的大麦和老鼠。该细菌部队在该处还建有一所四米见方的双重门的没有窗户的小屋，另有地下冷藏室一所，都是供培养细菌兵器用的。
    天坛防疫处在天坛西南，就是现在的中央防疫实验处的地址。该处在日寇占领时与现在南面的华北人民医院是相连在一起的。日寇在那里建筑的房子不少，除去宿舍与病房外，工作室约有一百余间。前天坛防疫处处长汤飞凡说：“我在一九四五年日寇投降后接管‘北支甲一八五五部队’所占据的天坛防疫处时，曾询问有没有毒性菌种，日本人说只有斑疹伤寒的菌种，因此只交出斑疹伤寒的菌种。但本处在今年成立菌种室后，收集全处各部门的菌种时，发现六管只写有日本女人名字的菌种。第一号是杉田辛平，第二号是杉田昭子，第三号是杉田奉子，第五号是永排胜子，第六号是杉田佳子，第八号是岩谷文容。六管菌种经过培养试验以后，发现其中五管是毒性鼠疫杆菌，第八号的毒力可能已经消失。这是证明日寇曾在该处制造细菌武器的最有力的证据之一。”此外，在前天坛防疫处院内并有日寇遗留下的十一吨、十二吨、十三吨三个六公尺长的大消毒锅，是用来将培养菌种的器具消毒的。仓库内还存有大量的铝质培养箱。据当时在该部队工作的机械匠陈康延说：日寇在投降后不但毁掉很多文件器材，并曾用坦克车大量地压毁或烧毁很多铝质培养箱。他并说，当日本人在这里时，有两个工人每天专门作刷煤油桶和揭桶盖的工作。每天有大批这样做好了的煤油桶，用卡车送到静生生物调查所去。培养动物的小动物室的规模也是极大的，有四排房屋，共约七十余间，每间室内可饲养数百只甚至一千只老鼠。日寇曾用麻袋大批运来血粉，作为细菌培养剂用，到现在为止，人民医院北面的地下还曾埋有日寇用剩的血粉，下雨时还有腥臭味。
