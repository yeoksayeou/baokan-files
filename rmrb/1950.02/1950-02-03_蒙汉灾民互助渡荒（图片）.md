　　Mongolian and Han Disaster Victims Help Each Other to Survive the Famine
    Wū ēn
    (1) Herdsman Wūlèjí only started farming last year. With the help of the work exchange group, he worked very hard to plant several plots of land. Unexpectedly, everything was flooded in the autumn, so he didn't want to do it anymore.
    (2) Wūlèjí proposed to the group leader that he wanted to return to herding or flee the famine. At that time, the group leader reviewed his own inadequate help to him and provided various persuasion and explanations. Instead, he lost his temper with the group leader, saying, "Are you telling us to starve to death here?"
    (3) The group leader convened a group discussion and proposed mutual aid in production, but no one was willing to take out their grain to give to others during the famine.
    (4) After the meeting, the group leader spared one of his last two *dou* of sorghum to Wūlèjí, and informed him of the group's mutual aid production plan, explaining that as long as everyone helped each other, they would not go hungry. This moved Wūlèjí and the whole group, and a mutual aid production movement quickly unfolded throughout the village.
    (5) The whole group assessed the points for carts, horses, and labor. Male laborers were organized to go up the mountain to collect firewood and transport goods; female laborers were organized into groups to weave mats, weave baskets, and spin thread. Wūlèjí's wife participated in the mat weaving group.
    (6) In the evening, the couple came back and boiled a pot of alkali. They have accumulated seven *shi* and five *dou* of grain from their production, enough for their family of three to eat until the spring harvest next year.

　　蒙汉灾民互助渡荒
    乌恩
    （一）牧民乌勒吉，头年才开始种地，在换工组的帮助下，很辛苦的种了几垧地。不料秋天全被水淹了，因此再也不想干了。
    （二）乌勒吉向小组长提出要复业或是逃荒。当时组长检讨自己对他的帮助不够，进行了各种说服解释。他反而向组长发脾气说：“难道叫我们饿死这里不成。”
    （三）组长召集小组讨论提出互助生产，可是谁也不愿意在渡荒时把粮食拿出来给别人。
    （四）会后，组长把自己最后的二斗高粱，匀出一斗给乌勒吉，并通知他小组互助生产计划，说明只要大家互助，便不会挨饿。这样，感动了乌勒吉和全组，全村很快展开了互助生产运动。
    （五）全组把车、马、人工等都评了分，男劳动组织起来上山打柴、拉脚；女劳动组织编席、编筐和纺线小组。乌勒吉屋里的参加了编席小组。
    （六）晚上，两口子回来还熬一锅碱。他们生产已积粮七石五斗，可供全家三口吃到明年春粮下来。
