Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 13th - TASS, Prague, 10th: Electra News Agency, citing broadcasts from the Free Greece radio station, stated that the Greek people have sufficient strength to thwart plans to forcibly impose a military dictatorship in the March elections.

	The broadcast pointed out that all Greek democratic organizations, including right-wing political leaders opposed to royalist fascism and dictatorial plans, have their place in the "Democratic Front" organized by the people to defeat the conspiracies of the United States and the ruling clique.

	Now, the time has come for all democratic parties and groups to state their position and answer the following question: "Are you for the people and Greece, or for royalist fascism and subservience to the Americans?". The radio station pointed out that the secret reactionary military organization "New Officers League" is concentrating the work of preparing for a military dictatorship in its own hands.

	The radio station called for a struggle to establish a democratic front of all anti-royalist fascist elements.

    号召希腊民主组织  挫败军事独裁阴谋
    【新华社北京十三日电】塔斯社布拉格十日讯：电通社援引自由希腊无线电台广播称：希腊人民拥有足够的力量，在三月选举中挫败企图强行军事独裁的计划。
    广播指出：希腊一切民主组织，包括反对保皇法西斯主义和独裁计划的右翼政治领袖在内，在人民为击败美国与统治集团的阴谋而组织的“民主阵线”中均有他们的位置。
    现在，一切民主党派与团体，表明他们的立场并答复下列问题的时候已经到了：“你是为人民和希腊，还是为保皇法西斯主义和屈从于美国人呢？”。电台指出，秘密的反动军事组织“新军官联盟”正在把准备军事独裁的工作集中在自己的手里。
    电台号召为建立一切反保皇法西斯分子的民主阵线而斗争。
