Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, February 2nd: The Hong Kong British government police used submachine guns, pistols, tear gas, and batons on the evening of the 30th to carry out armed suppression of more than three thousand tram, telephone, and electric light industry workers who were gathering, resulting in a massive bloody tragedy. According to preliminary statistics, twenty-eight workers were seriously injured, with many more suffering minor injuries, and the tram workers' union headquarters was also destroyed. On the morning of the 31st, the Hong Kong police unreasonably sealed off the tram workers' union and arrested the union's chairman, Liu Fa, secretary, Li Wenhai, and staff member, Chen Yaocai. The Hong Kong British government dispatched a large number of police, first blockading the entrance of the tram workers' union, and then rushing in to beat people, leading to a massive bloody tragedy, when thirty-eight groups persecuted by the Hong Kong British government, totaling more than three thousand people, were collectively expressing their condolences to the tram workers who had been on strike for more than a month and gathering for a get-together.

　　港英政府暴力镇压工人酿成巨大流血惨案
    重伤二十八人并无理逮捕电车工会主席
    【新华社广州二日电】香港英政府警察三十日晚使用冲锋枪、手枪、催泪弹和木棍等武器，对正在集会的三千余电车、电话、电灯等业工人实行武装镇压，酿成巨大流血惨案。据初步统计，工人重伤二十八名，轻伤者极多，电车工会会址亦被捣毁。三十一日晨，香港警察复无理将电车工会查封，并逮捕该工会主席刘法、书记李文海、职员陈耀材等三人。香港英政府系于三十八个被香港英政府迫害的团体三千余人集体慰问罢工已达月余的电车工人并集会联欢时，派遣大批警察首先封锁电车工会门口，继而冲入大打出手，致酿成巨大流血惨案。
