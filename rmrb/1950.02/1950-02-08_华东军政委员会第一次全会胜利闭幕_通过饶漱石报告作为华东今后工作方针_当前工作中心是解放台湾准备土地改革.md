Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, February 7th. The First Plenary Session of the East China Military and Political Committee, marking the great unity of the people of East China, began on the 27th of last month. After five days of general sessions and six days of group sessions of repeated study and discussion, it successfully concluded on the evening of the 6th. At the closing meeting, Chairman Rao Shushi made a brief conclusion on the discussion of the report on the tasks of the East China Military and Political Committee. Chairman Rao pointed out that after several days of discussion and the speeches of thirty-seven committee members, everyone unanimously agreed with the report on the tasks of the East China Military and Political Committee, without any opposing or skeptical views. The complete agreement of all the committee members is the conclusion of the tasks of the East China Military and Political Committee. The meeting unanimously adopted Chairman Rao Shushi's "Report on the Tasks of the East China Military and Political Committee" and resolved to take the report as the guiding principle for the work of the East China Military and Political Committee in the future, and to strive resolutely for its implementation. The meeting adopted the "East China New Liberated Areas Rural Rent Reduction Regulations," the "East China Region Agricultural Tax Collection General Rules," and the "East China Region 1950 Tax Revenue Task Allocation," and unanimously resolved to adopt the three documents passed by the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, namely, the "Provisional Measures for Handling Labor-Capital Relations," the "Provisional Measures for Labor-Capital Parties in Private Industrial and Commercial Enterprises to Conclude Collective Contracts," and the "Provisional Measures for Labor Dispute Resolution Procedures," as the provisional measures for handling labor-capital relations in the East China region. The meeting approved in principle Vice Chairman Ma Yinchu's report on the "Organizational Regulations of the East China Military and Political Committee" and also approved the staffing of various units of the East China Military and Political Committee, which will be submitted to the State Council of the Central People's Government for approval and appointment. The meeting also approved the proposal on production and disaster relief in East China and established the East China Region Production and Disaster Relief Committee to organize and plan unified leadership of production and disaster relief work in East China, and nominated Kui Yanfang as Chairman, and Shen Zixiu, Xie Hui, Ji Yuting, and Zhao Puchu as Vice Chairmen. Finally, the meeting adopted a congratulatory telegram to Chairman Mao and the Central People's Government, a telegram supporting Foreign Minister Zhou's statement of January 19th, a telegram to the Third Field Army, and an open letter to the people of Taiwan. Finally, in his closing remarks, Committee Member Liu Xiao pointed out that the establishment of the East China Military and Political Committee and the successful conclusion of this meeting are important milestones in the construction of a new East China. He said that the central link of the current work is the two tasks of "liberating Taiwan" and "actively preparing for land reform." In order to complete these two tasks, we would rather endure temporary local pain in order to achieve permanent peace and development. Committee Member Liu said that in order to implement these resolutions that we have unanimously adopted, we must thoroughly explain the resolutions of this meeting to all the people of East China. Committee Member Liu concluded by saying: I firmly believe that all Communist Party members in East China will, after this meeting, continue the spirit of unity and cooperation of this meeting, humbly cooperate closely with non-Party members, work together, and set an example in leading the broad masses of the people of East China to protect and thoroughly implement all the resolutions passed by this meeting. At the closing meeting, representatives from six units, including the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, the Democratic League, the Democratic National Construction Association, the China Association for Promoting Democracy, the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party, and the Shanghai Branch of the China New Law Research Association, presented flags to the meeting.
