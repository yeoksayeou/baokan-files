　　North China Troops Economize to Aid Disaster Relief
    Attention to Production and Improved Management Saves Over a Million Jin of Rice in Three Months
    Many Units Achieve Both Economy and Improved Troop Life
    [Our Newspaper's Report] The People's Liberation Army North China Military Region troops have achieved great success in economizing to aid disaster relief. After the Military Region Headquarters and Political Department jointly issued a call on September 10th of last year for the entire army to launch a movement to save one liang of rice per person per day to help disaster-stricken compatriots in North China, the entire army universally launched a mass movement of economizing to aid disaster relief, and has already received the expected results. In just three months, savings in rice reached over one million jin. Many units were able to combine the specific circumstances of the troops with education on loving the motherland, loving the people, and cherishing the property of the motherland, thereby improving the troops' class consciousness, strengthening the relationship between the army and the people, promoting the enthusiasm and creativity of the masses, improving work, and improving troop life to a certain extent. This is the basic and main aspect; but on the other hand, although the movement has been launched in a few units, it has affected the lives of the troops, with the phenomenon of not having enough to eat. The following is a comprehensive report based on the existing materials from various units:
    Leaders at all levels regard this movement as an important political task. The Party Committee personally takes charge and, based on the specific conditions of the unit, makes more specific resolutions and instructions to promote the entire army and set off a wave of responding to the call and economizing to aid disaster relief. Simultaneously with the economizing to aid disaster relief movement, a universal movement to eliminate waste, increase production, and solve difficulties personally has been launched. Taking a certain army of a certain corps as an example: this army saved nearly 300,000 jin of millet in September, October, and November, which was even more than the amount of rice that should have been saved. The Political Department of a certain division saved one-sixth of its public miscellaneous expenses in October. In order to solve the difficulty of straw for bedding in winter, the entire division mobilized to cut 290,000 jin of grass. The Aviation Department of the Military Region, in conjunction with fire prevention, air defense, and the organization of equipment, carried out grass cutting and the collection of broken steel and iron under the slogan of "solving difficulties by ourselves"; the Military Region Health Department Headquarters saved more than 20,000 yuan in office expenses in October compared with September, and universally reorganized tap water and electric lights, reducing the number of light bulbs from 498 to 350, and reduced the brightness of the lights, without affecting work. Examples like this are common in other units. Not only was the task of economizing completed, but the concept of labor and the concept of cherishing public property were established, and the system was rectified with the development of the movement. Some units were even able to organize their own forces to actively help farmers produce and provide disaster relief. For example, in Zhuoxian County, Hebei Province, the summer and autumn floods submerged more than 880 hectares of land. A certain regiment of a certain division spared time to organize more than 780 people to help dig canals to divert water into the river, saving more than 2,000 mu of good farmland. The Cangxian County sub-district of Hebei Province used game time to collect wild vegetables and send them to the disaster victims. The entire district collected more than 40,000 jin and handed them over to the local government for distribution.
    The vast majority of leaders at all levels have been able to grasp the spirit of the Military Region's call and instructions, so that the lives of the troops have not only not been affected, but, with the exception of a few units, have generally improved. Taking a certain division as an example, a universal review of eliminating waste was conducted, and active efforts were made to improve food. The living standards of the troops have gradually risen compared to before the savings. Many units can drink soy milk every day, and can generally turn millet into coarse and fine rice flour (grinding it themselves), and change various different food patterns, such as silk cakes, bean buns, cakes, etc., and there is no phenomenon of not having enough to eat. In terms of non-staple food, it also exceeds the supply standard for vegetable money. According to a survey by the Third Company of a certain regiment of the division, each person drinks an average of two bowls of soy milk a day, eats two fried dough sticks, eats 1.3 liang of oil, 1.4 jin of vegetables, and 8 qian each of salt and meat. Every day, 10 jin of beans are ground to make tofu, and bean curd is used as a dish. This is the general situation of the division. In addition, each unit has some savings in food. This is a better example, which shows that under strong leadership, the enthusiasm and creativity of the masses are stimulated, and it is possible to achieve both economy and improve the lives of the troops in our current situation. Some units have a phenomenon of not having enough to eat after saving one liang of rice, because they have not paid enough attention to production and improved management (at the same time, many military families from disaster areas have come to the team)…. This is the situation of some individual units, but in general, according to the general situation of the troops, these difficulties can be overcome if leaders and the masses are combined, learn from experience and lessons, and actively think of ways.

　　华北各部队节约救灾
    注意生产改进管理三个月节米百余万斤
    许多单位做到既节约又改善了部队生活
    【本报讯】人民解放军华北军区部队的节约救灾工作获得很大成绩。去年九月十日，军区司令部、政治部联合发出全军开展每人每日节约一两米运动，救济华北灾难同胞的号召后，全军普遍的展开了节约救灾的群众性运动，并已收到了预期的成绩，只三个月节约米即达一百数十万斤。不少单位能结合部队具体情况，进行爱祖国、爱人民、爱护祖国财产的教育，从而提高了部队的阶级觉悟，亲密了军民关系，发扬了群众的积极性、创造性，改进了工作，并在一定程度上改善了部队生活。这是基本的、主要的一方面；但另一方面也有少数单位运动虽然展开了，但使部队生活受影响，有不够吃现象。兹根据现有各单位的材料综合报道如下：
    各级领导将这一运动当做一个重要的政治任务，党委亲自掌握，根据本单位情况，做出更具体的决议与指示，推动全军，掀起响应号召、节约救灾热潮。与节约救灾运动同时，普遍的展开了杜绝浪费、增加生产、亲自动手解决困难运动。以某兵团某军为例：该军九、十、十一三个月节约小米近三十万斤，较应节约米数尚多出。某师政治部十月份公杂费节约六分之一，为解决过冬铺草困难问题，全师动手打草二十九万斤。军区航空处结合防火、防空、整理器材等工作，在“自己动手解决困难”口号下，进行打草，收敛破钢破铁；军区卫生部本部十月份较九月份节省办公费二万余元，并普遍整理了自来水、电灯，灯头由过去四百九十八个减至三百五十个，并且减低了灯度，而并不影响工作。诸如此类的例子，在其他各单位中普遍存在，不仅完成了节约任务，并随着运动的展开而树立了劳动观念与爱护公物观念，整顿了制度。有些单位并能组织自己力量，主动的帮助农民生产救灾。例如河北涿县一区夏秋水涨，淹没八八○余顷地，某师某团抽出时间，组织七百八十余人力，帮助挖渠引水入河，救出良田二千余亩；河北沧县分区利用游戏时间，采集野菜，送给灾民，全区共采集四万余斤，送交地方政府分配。
    各级领导，绝大多数能够掌握军区号召、指示的精神，使部队生活不仅未受影响，除了少数单位外，一般都有改善。以某师为例，普遍进行了杜绝浪费的检讨，积极想办法改进伙食，部队生活水平比节约前，反而逐渐上升，很多单位能够每天喝豆浆，普遍做到能把小米变成粗细米面（自己动手推磨），变换各种不同的食品花样，如丝糕、豆包、饼子……等，没有吃不饱的现象；在副食品上，也超过菜金供给标准，据该师某团三连的调查，每天每人平均喝豆浆两碗，吃油条两个，吃油一两三钱，菜一斤四两，盐、肉各八钱，每天磨豆子十斤做豆腐，另有粉条在外。某团九连每天每人吃菜十二两、盐八钱、油九钱四、肉六钱，另外每天以三十斤豆子做成豆腐，豆丝作菜，这是该师的一般情况。除此，各单位在伙食上还有一部节余。这是一个较好的例子，说明了在有力的领导下，启发了群众的积极性、创造性，在我们现在情况下是可以做到既节约又能改善部队生活的。有些单位在节约一两米后，有不够吃现象，原因是注意生产及改进管理工作不够（同时灾区军属来队，数量很多）……。这是一些个别单位的情况，但总的来说，按照现在部队的一般情况，这些困难，如果经过领导与群众结合，吸取经验教训，积极想办法，是可以克服的。
