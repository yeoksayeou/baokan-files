Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 23rd: The coal mine production plan for the Central South Region for 1950, passed by the Central South Region Coal Mine Conference held last December and approved by the Central Fuel Industry Department, stipulates that the main task of the Central South Region's coal mines in 1950 is still to vigorously restore production. The output of various public and private coal mines in 1950 will increase more than sixfold compared to the output in 1949. However, the total annual demand for the entire region will still be 23.6% short, and it will still be necessary to rely on North China and other regions. Therefore, the plan also stipulates that the construction of the new large mine in Pingxiang Coal Mine will be completed in 1950, and the Yongshao area of the Xiang-Gui-Qian Railway, the Pingdingshan area of Henan, and the Zixing mining area in the southern section of the Yue-Han Railway will be surveyed to prepare for construction to supply the coal needed for the western section of the Longhai Railway, the southern section of the Yue-Han Railway, and Guangzhou. Although most of the coal mines in Central South China have resumed production in 1949, due to the fact that transportation has not been restored and coal production is stockpiled in mining areas, production efficiency is not high, and the average coal production efficiency per worker in the entire region does not exceed 0.1 tons, the cost of coal is generally higher than that in Northeast and North China. To this end, this year's plan stipulates that each mine should improve the technology of mining and transportation inside and outside the pit under the existing conditions, strengthen security work and rationally organize the labor force, and specifically stipulate the figures for each mine to improve production efficiency and reduce production costs. For example, Pingxiang Coal Mine should increase efficiency by 50% to 100% on the existing basis, and the cost should be reduced by 27% compared with the average of the fourth quarter of 1949. In addition, the conference made specific decisions on establishing the Central South China Coal Mine leading organs, strengthening trade union work, and establishing an economic accounting system.

　　中南区确定煤矿生产计划
    生产量要较去年提高六倍  完成萍乡新大井建设工程
    【新华社北京二十三日电】为去年十二月召开的中南区煤矿会议通过，并经中央燃料工业部批准的中南区一九五○年的煤矿生产计划规定，一九五○年中南区煤矿的主要任务仍为大力恢复生产。一九五○年各公私营煤矿的生产量较一九四九年的产量提高六倍多。但是，全区全年需要量仍有百分之二十三．六不足，尚需仰给于华北等地。因此计划又规定于一九五○年内完成萍乡煤矿新大井的建设工程，并勘测湘桂黔路之永邵、河南之平顶山与粤汉南段资兴等矿区，准备建设，以供应陇海西段、粤汉南段及广州所需煤量。一九四九年中南各煤矿虽已大部恢复生产，但由于交通没有恢复、煤产积压矿区，生产效率不高，全区每工平均产煤效率不超过○．一吨等原因，煤的成本一般比东北、华北为高。为此，今年的计划规定各矿应在现有的条件下，改善坑内外采掘搬运的技术，加强保安工作和合理地组织劳动力，并具体规定出各矿应提高生产效率和应降低生产成本的数字。如萍乡煤矿应在现有的基础上提高效率百分之五十至一百，成本要比一九四九年第四季的平均数降低百分之二十七。此外会议对建立中南区煤矿领导机关、加强工会工作、建立经济核算制度等，都作了具体决定。
