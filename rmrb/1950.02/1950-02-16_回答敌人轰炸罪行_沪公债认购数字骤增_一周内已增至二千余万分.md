Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, February 15th. The number of public bonds subscribed by all circles in Shanghai in the week (7th to 13th) after the bandit plane bombing surged from over 13 million shares to 22,466,000 shares. The rapid increase in the number of public bond subscriptions shows that the unyielding people of Shanghai are answering the enemy's bombing atrocities with practical patriotic actions. Zhang Laifa, a labor model of the Shanghai Electric Power Company, was injured and sacrificed in the bombing. Before his death, he instructed his son to take all his savings in the People's Bank to buy public bonds, which is a clear example. As of the 13th, more than 40 industries in the business community have completed their predetermined targets, and half of them have exceeded their assigned tasks. Currently, the people of the city are in a very high mood to avenge their compatriots who died, and the upsurge of buying public bonds is continuing to deepen.

　　回答敌人轰炸罪行
    沪公债认购数字骤增  一周内已增至二千余万分
    【新华社上海十五日电】上海各界认购公债数字在匪机轰炸后的一周（七至十三日）内，已由一千三百余万分骤增至二千二百四十六万六千分。公债认购数字的迅速增加，正显示出不屈的上海人民正以实际的爱国行动来答复敌人的轰炸暴行。上海电力公司劳动模范张来发炸伤牺牲，临终时嘱咐他的儿子把他存在人民银行的折实储蓄通通拿去买公债，就是一个显明的例子。工商界截至十三日止已有四十余个行业完成预定目标，其中半数并已超过分配任务。现全市人民要为死难同胞复仇的情绪非常激昂，购买公债的热潮正继续深入展开中。
