Taiwan Democratic Self-Government League
Calls on Taiwanese Compatriots to Fight Heroically, Preparing to Coordinate in the Liberation of Taiwan

　　The Taiwan Democratic Self-Government League today issued a letter to Taiwanese compatriots commemorating the third anniversary of the "February 28th" incident. The full text is as follows: Dear Taiwanese Compatriots:

　　Today is the third anniversary of the "February 28th" incident, when all the people of Taiwan Province united to resist the Kuomintang reactionary regime's rule in Taiwan. After the Chinese people won victory in the eight-year War of Resistance Against Japan, they recovered Taiwan from the hands of Japanese imperialists, and the people of Taiwan were thus able to return to the embrace of the motherland. However, since the Kuomintang reactionary government took over Taiwan, it has imposed harsh taxes, levies, and cruel oppression on the people of Taiwan. This has forced the people of Taiwan to live in an extremely dark, terrifying, and starving situation. On "February 28th," we, the people of Taiwan, united to launch a vigorous struggle against the Kuomintang reactionaries for survival and democratic freedom. At that time, the reactionaries transferred a large number of reinforcements from the mainland to suppress us and deceived some of the provincial people, resulting in a painful defeat for the "February 28th" struggle, with more than 10,000 heroic martyrs sacrificing themselves under the enemy's knives. The failure of "February 28th" taught us that only by the close unity of all the people of the province and with the people of the whole country can we defeat the enemy; and that in the most intense moments of struggle, wavering and compromising and harboring illusions about the enemy will not only lead to the failure of the struggle but also to even more painful sacrifices. This is the bloody lesson of "February 28th."

China's People Must Liberate Taiwan, U.S. Imperialism Cannot Save Chiang Kai-shek's Bandits from Extinction

　　In the past three years, unprecedented changes have taken place in our country's history. In the revolutionary struggle, the Chinese people annihilated more than 7.44 million armed enemies, liberated all of the mainland except Tibet, overthrew the Kuomintang reactionary regime fully supported by U.S. imperialism, and Chiang Kai-shek's remaining bandits have been thoroughly defeated on the mainland. The remaining remnant soldiers and defeated generals of Chiang's bandit gang can only shrink back to Taiwan and a few other small islands, and sell Taiwan to U.S. imperialists, luring U.S. imperialists to continue to support them in their death throes. U.S. imperialists are also using this opportunity to step up their aggression and control over Taiwan, while also using their running dogs to carry out conspiracies to demand "trusteeship" or "independence," attempting to completely turn Taiwan into a colony of U.S. imperialism. However, the conspiracy of Chiang Kai-shek and U.S. imperialism to collude and act as accomplices cannot save them from their final demise. Today, the revolutionary forces of the Chinese people are unprecedentedly strong, the Chinese people have an incomparably heroic and victorious People's Liberation Army, a central people's government enthusiastically supported by the people of the whole country, and the assistance of the world's peace and democracy camp headed by the Soviet Union. The 470 million people of the country have resolved to make the liberation of Taiwan and the unification of all of China as the first major task of this year, and are preparing to concentrate all forces to cross the sea, annihilate the remaining forces of Chiang's bandit gang, and liberate Taiwan.

The Day of Taiwan's Liberation is Approaching, Taiwanese Compatriots Should Unite to Smash the Conspiracies of Chiang and the U.S.

　　Dear Taiwanese Compatriots: We, the people of Taiwan, have a revolutionary tradition of opposing Japanese imperialism for decades, and especially the great heroic spirit we displayed in the "February 28th" struggle against the Kuomintang's reactionary rule is something we should be proud of. Therefore, today we must once again develop this glorious revolutionary tradition and the experience of the heroic struggle of "February 28th" to smash the conspiracies of Chiang's bandit gang and U.S. imperialism, and forcefully coordinate with the People's Liberation Army in the war to liberate Taiwan. The liberation of Taiwan is bound to be realized, and the day of liberation is approaching. Therefore, we must use every opportunity and all possible conditions, and do everything possible to weaken and disintegrate the strength of Chiang's bandit gang. We must remember the lessons of "February 28th," unite as one, oppose Chiang's bandits' conscription, grain requisition, and taxation in Taiwan, and at the same time, be good at taking all measures to preserve our strength, strengthen our strength, and prepare to cooperate with the People's Liberation Army to jointly complete the task of liberating Taiwan.

　　Eternal glory to the martyrs who heroically sacrificed in the "February 28th" struggle!

　　Long live the People's Republic of China!

　　Long live the Central People's Government!

　　Long live the People's Liberation Army!

　　Long live the Chinese Communist Party!

　　Long live Chairman Mao!

### 台湾民主自治同盟  号召台胞英勇斗争  准备配合解放台湾

专栏：纪念“二·二八”三周年

　　台湾民主自治同盟
    号召台胞英勇斗争  准备配合解放台湾
    【新华社上海二十七日电】台湾民主自治同盟本日发表纪念“二、二八”告台湾同胞书，全文如下：亲爱的台湾同胞们：
    今天是我们全台湾省人民一致起来反抗国民党反动政权在台湾统治的“二、二八”三周年纪念日。中国人民经过八年抗战获得胜利，才由日本帝国主义者的手里收回了台湾，台湾人民也因此才回到祖国的怀抱。然而国民党反动政府自劫收了台湾以后，即对台湾人民施行苛敛诛求、横暴残酷的虐政。这样，迫得台湾人民生活在极端黑暗、恐怖、饥饿的绝境。“二、二八”这一天，我们台湾人民为了生存和民主自由，即团结起来向国民党反动派进行轰轰烈烈的斗争。当时，反动派由内地抽调大批援军来镇压我们，并欺骗一部分省民，以致“二、二八”的斗争遭受了惨痛的失败，一万多的英勇烈士在敌人的屠刀下牺牲了。“二、二八”的失败，教训我们必须全省人民紧密团结，和全国人民在一起，才能战胜敌人；而在斗争最激烈的时候，动摇妥协，对敌人抱幻想，那么不仅斗争一定要失败，而且还会遭受到更惨痛的牺牲。这是“二、二八”的血的教训。
    中国人民一定要解放台湾  美帝挽救不了蒋匪的灭亡
    三年来，我国历史已经起了空前的变化。中国人民在革命斗争中歼灭了七百四十四万余的武装敌人，解放了除西藏以外的全部大陆，推翻了美帝国主义所全力支持的国民党反动政权，蒋介石残余匪帮已在大陆上遭到彻底的失败。蒋匪帮所剩下来的残兵败将，只能龟缩在台湾和其他几个小岛上，并且把台湾出卖给美帝国主义者，勾引美帝国主义者继续支持他们作垂死的挣扎。美帝国主义者也利用这个机会，加紧对台湾的侵略和控制，同时又利用其走狗进行要求“托管”或“独立”的阴谋，企图把台湾完全变成美帝国主义的殖民地。但是，蒋介石和美帝国主义相互勾结、狼狈为奸的阴谋，是绝对不能挽救他们最后灭亡的命运的。今天，中国人民的革命力量已空前强大，中国人民有着一支英勇无比、百战百胜的人民解放军，有着全国人民所热烈拥护的中央人民政府和以苏联为首的全世界和平民主阵营的援助。全国四万万七千万人民已经决心把解放台湾统一全中国作为今年的第一个重大任务，准备集中一切力量，渡海歼灭蒋匪帮的残余势力，解放台湾。
    台湾解放的日子已迫近了  台胞应团结粉碎蒋美阴谋
    亲爱的台湾同胞们：我们台湾人民有着数十年间反对日本帝国主义的革命传统，尤其我们在“二、二八”反对国民党反动统治的斗争中，所表现出来的伟大的英雄气概，是值得我们骄傲的。所以今天我们必须再发挥这种光荣的革命传统和“二、二八”英勇斗争的经验，来粉碎蒋匪帮和美帝国主义的阴谋，在解放台湾的战争中，有力地配合人民解放军。台湾的解放是必定要实现的，而解放的日子是迫近了。所以我们必须利用每个机会和一切的可能条件，想尽一切的办法去削弱和瓦解蒋匪帮的力量。我们必须记取“二、二八”的教训，一致团结起来，反对蒋匪在台湾抽兵、征粮、征税，同时还要善于采取一切办法，保存我们的力量，壮大我们的力量，准备配合人民解放军，共同完成解放台湾的任务。
    “二、二八”斗争中英勇牺牲的烈士永垂不朽！
    中华人民共和国万岁！
    中央人民政府万岁！
    人民解放军万岁！
    中国共产党万岁！
    毛主席万岁！
          台湾民主自治同盟  一九五○年二月二十八日
