　　On Mass Creation
    Zhao Shuli
    When I was in the Taihang Mountains, I had two opportunities to come into contact with mass creation: one was during the Spring Festival of 1944, when the Shanxi-Hebei-Shandong-Henan Border Region Government launched a rural entertainment competition and asked me to review the submissions for over a month; the other was when I and several comrades ran a small newspaper called "New Masses," and I served as an editor for about a month. After coming to Beijing, I encountered this opportunity again, which was when I watched several performances of the workers' drama competition last October.

    In many mass works, I have seen two common characteristics: First, they are diverse in both content and form. Second, the specific lives they write about often contain things that are not easily understood by us literary workers beforehand. After reading their works, I feel that my own contact with the social landscape is too narrow and superficial.

    Of course, we should not belittle ourselves: under the condition that the cultural level of the masses has not been raised to a certain level, we can easily write better than the masses about things we can see, otherwise our literary workers would have no use. But from an objective point of view, we cannot but be narrower and more superficial than what the masses see in some places. The social landscape is very complex, and the masses are the direct constituents of these complex aspects. We literary workers are not only not present in every corner, but also do not necessarily directly participate in the lives of the masses. How can we not be narrower and more superficial than what the masses see? Take myself as an example: I don't produce, I don't fight, I don't pay public grain, I don't serve long terms of labor, I don't support a family, I don't suffer from disasters... All the social troubles do not directly trouble me. Even if I claim to be more sensitive (to be tested), the only dishes that can be put on the table are those few. It is not easy to carefully taste the things that are not often eaten, let alone guess whether the foods that have never been seen are sour or sweet.

    In the year I reviewed the submissions, the popular literary works in the Taihang Mountains included several types: "Speaking out of grievances and turning over a new leaf," "Persuading husband to join the army," "Killing the enemy hero," and "Labor model." These are naturally worth writing about, but these few aspects alone do not constitute a society, and it is a pity that everyone cannot easily jump out of this circle. After reading some plays written by the masses, I discovered new worlds that our writing has not yet reached. For example, Wang Yuan from Nanzhuanggou Village, Pingshun County, Shanxi Province, wrote a short play called "Telling Qin Fubao to Herd Cattle" (which has been selected into the People's Literature Series), which describes the past suffering of the herding children, the Yangge competition of their twelve villages at that time, and some small evaluations of the characters in the village, gently and cleverly reflecting the happiness of the people after the land reform. Another example is a short play called "Divine Insect" written by a person from Liao County, Shanxi Province (also see the previous book), which describes the locust plague in his area, where everyone is fighting locusts, but an old man is using spells to suppress the locusts. In the end, he sees that his spells are not working, so he takes the wooden board painted with spells and joins the masses to fight. Without much effort, it also writes about the ideological transformation of an elderly person. These are all to illustrate that the masses each have their own social life circles, which together are much larger than our life circles.

    Based on my own little experience in mass creation, I feel that the above-mentioned shortcomings can be compensated by launching mass creation. Therefore, I suggest that the cultural organs of governments at all levels and various cultural groups at all levels should jointly, systematically, and regularly launch mass creation.

    If my suggestion can be adopted, I would be more willing to provide the following points of reference for the comrades who do this work:

    1. When launching, we should focus on collecting finished products, and not order goods. The masses all have a desire to create. As long as they can regularly collect and award prizes every year, it is already a launch. This kind of launch can be combined with the voluntary nature of the masses, and therefore the works obtained are often full of real life in content. When we were running the "New Masses" newspaper, we received dozens of letters every day. Although most of these letters asked us to answer their questions, the details of the questions often became simple, literary short stories. The opposite is also true: in the land reform writing competition sponsored by the Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Border Region Government, although the higher authorities did not issue specific orders, the understanding of the masses was not consistent when the message was conveyed - some created stiff stories to cater to the preferences of the staff, and forcibly added some political slogans; some considered it a burden and only took some irrelevant clichés to perfunctorily deal with it. As a result, although there were good ones, they were not as many as we expected. These two examples are enough to illustrate that if the masses want to write themselves, they can write fulfilling things; if others want them to write, they don't know what to write.

    2. When evaluating, we should focus entirely on content. Because of the limitations of the cultural level of the masses, not to mention whether the form is complete or not, or whether it is creative or not, even the words written on the manuscript vary in size from walnut-sized to melon seed-sized. The paper they use not only has no grids, but also does not distinguish between size and whether it is new or old. Sometimes, the old book printed on one side is torn apart and turned over as manuscript paper, without chapters, without leaving margins, and black ink is written into a whole piece. When we look at the manuscripts, if we deny them from this appearance, then there is almost nothing to choose; if we put these impressions aside and only look at the issue from the living surface he wrote, there are often a lot of fresh things. However, this fresh thing cannot be sought to be fully saturated in a work: for example, in a play, one scene is desirable, or one or two paragraphs of dialogue in a scene are desirable, that is a harvest, and it is worth giving an award. Gold panning in sand is often more sand than gold, but in places where there are no richer gold mines outside the sand, gold can only be panned in the sand, and more panning will yield a large amount of pure gold. The situation in terms of form and content is also similar - often there is also great creativity, but the harvest in content is less. Many things with very rich content do not match the form used, so it cannot be listed as a necessary evaluation criterion.

    3. After the evaluation and awarding, there are four ways to deal with the selected manuscripts: (1) Those that can be published directly without modification or with slight modification are simply published, which is the cheapest thing. (2) For manuscripts with very full content but too unlike the form, the person in charge can modify them, but this modification should be faithful to the original work, and no useful material in the original work should be discarded. (3) Manuscripts with too simple content can be combined into one manuscript. (4) For manuscripts with only a little content, the useful bits and pieces can be classified and extracted from most of the manuscripts as material, and the person in charge can organize it into one or several works. (For items 2 and 3, it can be stated when publishing that so-and-so is the original author and so-and-so is the adapter, and for item 4, the name of the original author can not be signed when publishing)

    If this is done, I think we will get good works that we cannot make ourselves. This is my personal opinion, whether it is possible, please discuss. (Reprinted from "Literary Gazette" No. 10)

　　谈群众创作
    赵树理
    我在太行山里的时候，曾遇到两次和大众创作接触的机会：一次是一九四四年春节，晋冀鲁豫边区政府发动了个农村娱乐竞赛征文，叫我去看过一个多月的稿件；又一次是我和几位同志办过个《新大众》小报，我当了个把月编辑。来到北京以后，这种机会我又遇到过一次，那就是去年十月间看了几场工人戏剧竞赛的演出。
    在好多群众作品中，我见到两个共同的特点：第一、不论在内容上或形式上都是多样性的。第二、他们写出来的具体生活，有好多是我们文艺工作者事先不易体会到的。看了他们的东西，使我感觉到自己接触的社会面太狭窄、浮浅。
    自然我们也不应妄自非薄：在群众文化程度尚未提到一定高度的条件下，凡是我们见得到的事物，容易比群众写得出来，否则我们文艺工作者便没有什么作用。可是从客观条件上说来，有些地方我们不能不比群众所见的狭窄肤浅。社会面是很复杂的，而群众正是这些复杂面的直接组成者。我们文艺工作者，不但不是每个角落都有，而且也不一定直接参加群众的生活，如何能不比群众所见狭窄和肤浅呢？即以我自己为例吧：一不生产，二不打仗，三不出公粮，四不支长差，五不养家口，六不度灾荒……所有的社会麻烦，都直接麻烦不到我头上来，即使自命为感觉比较敏锐一点（待考），可是能摆到桌上的菜只有那么几味，其余不常吃到的东西，就不容易品得仔细，至于不曾见过的食品，那就更难猜测得出是酸的还是甜的了。
    在我看征文稿件那一年，太行山里流行的文艺作品，有“诉苦翻身”、“劝夫参军”、“杀敌英雄”、“劳动模范”等几个类型。这些自然都是值得写的，但只有这几面构不成个社会，可惜大家都不易跳出这个圈子。及至看了些群众写的剧本，我才又发现了些我们的笔墨还不曾走到的新世界。例如山西平顺县南庄沟村有个人叫王元，写了个小剧本《叫秦富宝放牛》（已被选入人民文艺丛书），里边写到放牛孩子过去的苦处，写到当时他们十二个村子的洋歌比赛，写了些本村人物小评，轻轻俏俏反映出土地改革后人民的快乐。又如山西辽县人写了个小剧叫《神虫》（也见前书），写他那地方遭了蝗灾，大家正打蝗虫，有个老头却在那里用符咒来镇蝗虫，最后看见自己的符咒不顶事，就拿着画了符的木板参加到群众队伍里打起来，也是没有费很大气力就写出一个老年人的思想转变。这些都是以说明群众各人有各人的社会生活圈子，合起来比我们的生活圈子大得多。
    根据我自己那一点点关于群众创作的经验，我觉得上述的缺陷，是可以用发动群众创作来弥补的，因而我建议各级政府的文化机关和各级各种文化团体，联合地、有计划地、经常地来发动群众创作。
    假如我这一建议能被采纳的话，我更愿意给作这种工作的同志们提供以下的几点参考意见：
    一、发动的时候，应以搜集成品为主，勿下令定货。群众都有创作欲，只要每年能定期搜集、评奖，已经就是发动了。这样的发动，是能和群众的自愿相结合的，因而所得到的作品，在内容上往往是充实的现实生活。我们在办《新大众》小报的时候，每天要收到几十件信件。这些信件中，虽然大半是要我们给他们解答问题，但所叙述的问题原委，往往就成为朴素的、有文艺性的小故事。相反的情况也有：在晋冀鲁豫边区政府征文那一次，上级虽然也不是下令定货，但传达下去，群众的了解就不很一致——有的为了迎合工作人员的所好，造了些生硬的故事，其中硬加了些政治口号；有的认为是一种负担，只拿些不关痛痒的滥套子来搪塞，结果虽然也有好的，但不如我们所期望的那么多。这两种事例，足以说明群众自己要写，就能写出充实的东西来；别人要他写，他便不知该写什么好了。
    二、评选的时候，应完全以内容为主。群众因为文化程度的限制，莫说形式的完整与否、有创造性与否不能计较，单就稿子上写的字来说，也是有核桃大的同时也有瓜子大的。他们用的稿纸，不但没有格子，而且也不分大小和新旧，有时候把那一面印的旧书拆开翻过来当作稿纸用，不分章节、不留边沿，黑墨笼统写成一片。我们看稿的时候，假如从这种外观上加以否定，那就几乎没有什么选的了；假如把这些印象置之度外，只从他写的生活面来看问题，往往有好多新鲜的东西。不过这新鲜的东西，在一个作品中也不能求其十分饱满：比方在一个剧本中，有一场是可取的，或在一场中有一两段对话是可取的，那就是收获，就值得给奖。沙里淘金常是沙多金少，可是在沙外没有更丰富的金矿的地方，金还只能在沙里淘，淘得多了也会得到多量的纯金。在形式方面和在内容方面的情况也有相同之处——往往也有创造性很大的，只是比内容上的收获少一点。有好多内容很充实的东西，其所用的形式比配不上，因此不可列为一条必要的评选标准。
    三、评选给奖之后，对选中了的稿子有四种处理办法：（一）不改或略改一下就可发表的，直接发表了就算了，那是最便宜的事。（二）内容很饱满形式太不像样的稿件，可由负责的人改作一下，不过这种改作要忠于原作，万不可把原作中有用的任何材料改丢了。（三）内容太单纯的稿子，可以合数稿改作为一稿。（四）仅有点滴内容的稿件，可以从多数稿件中把这有用的点滴分类摘录下来作为素材，由负责人把它组织为一个或几个作品。（二、三两项在发表时可以写明某某人原作某人改作，第四项在发表时可以不署原作者姓名）
    假如这样作的话，我以为是会得到我们自己作不出来的好作品的。这是我个人的意见，是否可能，还请大家讨论。（转载自《文艺报》第十期）
