Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, February 1st – The so-called "Bilateral Agreements" under which the United States provides "military aid" to eight vassal states within the North Atlantic Group—Britain, France, Italy, Norway, Denmark, Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg—were initiated in early December of last year. After setbacks and delays, they were finally signed separately in Washington on January 27. Among these, the US-UK, US-France, US-Italy, and US-Denmark agreements took effect immediately, while the other four agreements require ratification by the respective national parliaments before becoming effective. The so-called "North Atlantic Regional Defense Plan," passed by the "North Atlantic Treaty Organization Defense Committee" on December 1st of last year and signed and approved by the "North Atlantic Council" on January 6th of this year, was also approved by US President Truman on the same day. With this, the so-called "Mutual Defense Assistance Act of 1949," passed by the US Congress on September 28th of last year, has completed its legislative process. Under the guise of this "military aid," US imperialism will completely control the national defense sovereignty of West European countries and further force the West European people to serve as cannon fodder for the United States in launching aggressive wars. The US military expert delegations, which will directly command West European militaries, are about to arrive in the aforementioned eight countries, along with the $1 billion in military supplies allocated under the Act.

During the negotiation process of the "Bilateral Agreements," the US and its vassal state governments and newspapers carefully concealed the fact that the US was striving to seize the national defense sovereignty of the "recipient countries." However, the officially released contents of the "Bilateral Agreements" fully expose this point. According to the key points of the various "Bilateral Agreements" released by the US Information Service, the agreements stipulate that recipient countries "may not use military aid materials for purposes other than those originally intended without the consent of the United States," and "may not transfer military aid materials obtained on a grant basis to any other country." Britain, which initially caused setbacks in the "Bilateral Agreement" negotiations by demanding the freedom to transfer "military aid" materials, finally succumbed to US pressure.

The terms of the bilateral agreements clearly stipulate the harsh conditions under which the United States completely controls the "recipient countries" militarily. Article 1 of the agreement stipulates: "The governments of the United States and each of the other eight countries shall mutually provide, and provide to the governments of other countries agreed upon by both parties, equipment, materials, services, or other military assistance to promote the overall defense of the North Atlantic region." This so-called "overall defense," according to Truman's statement when approving the "Defense Plan" regarding "the cooperative use of the military resources of all countries and the specialization of each country," is actually to place the military forces of West European countries completely under the unified control of the United States, while assigning specific military tasks to West European countries. In addition, the various "Bilateral Agreements" stipulate that "recipient countries" must agree to accept the stationing of "military expert delegations" composed of US Army, Navy, and Air Force officers, as well as officials from the State Department and the "Marshall Plan" administration in their countries to "inspect the progress of assistance." These so-called "military expert delegations" will not only supervise the use and distribution of "military aid" materials, but also supervise the training and organization of the "recipient countries'" armed forces. At the same time, the huge expenses of the delegations must also be borne by the "recipient countries." The various "Bilateral Agreements" also allow the United States to enjoy further privileges in economically enslaving "recipient countries" under the banner of "cooperative use of military resources." The terms stipulate that "recipient countries" "agree to supply the United States with raw materials and semi-finished products that the United States feels it lacks and that can be obtained in a particular country and its territories"; "patent rights for materials supplied under the assistance program shall be protected"; "materials and equipment supplied shall be exempt from customs duties and domestic taxes in the importing country." Therefore, the signing of the "Bilateral Agreements" has advanced US imperialism's aggressive plan of so-called West European "economic integration" a step further. However, the hideous face of US imperialism and the traitorous behavior of the reactionary regimes of West European countries have also been further exposed to the people of Western Europe. This cannot but arouse increasingly widespread and powerful resistance from the people of Western Europe.

　　进一步掠夺西欧国家主权
    美与八国订《双边协定》
    条款规定了军事控制经济奴役
    【新华社北京一日电】美国供给北大西洋集团内英、法、意、挪、丹、比、荷、卢八个仆从国家以“军事援助”的所谓《双边协定》，自去年十二月初即开始谈判，在历经挫折与拖延之后，已于一月二十七日在华盛顿分别签字，其中美英、美法、美意、美丹四协定已于即日起生效，其他四协定尚须经有关国家的国会批准后，方生效力。而于去年十二月一日为“北大西洋公约防务委员会”所通过，并于今年一月六日为《北大西洋理事会》所批准签字的所谓《北大西洋区域防御计划》，亦在同一天为美国总统杜鲁门所批准。至此，美国国会于去年九月二十八日通过的所谓《一九四九年防务互助法案》，已完成其立法上的程序。美帝国主义将在这一《军事援助》的掩盖下，完全控制西欧各国的国防主权，进一步强使西欧人民充当美国在发动侵略战争时的炮灰。直接指挥西欧军事的美国军事专家代表团，即将与在该法案下拨付的十亿美元军事物资，同时抵达上述八国。
    在《双边协定》谈判的过程中，美国及其仆从国家的政府与报纸，曾小心翼翼地掩盖美国竭力攫取各“受援国”国防主权的事实，但官方发表的《双边协定》内容，却充分地暴露了这一点。据美国新闻处发表的各《双边协定》要点所透露，协定规定受援国“未经美国同意，不得把军援物资用于原定用途以外”，并“不得把在赠与基础上获得的军援物资转运至其他任何国家”。最初因要求自由转让“军援”物资而使《双边协定》的谈判发生挫折的英国，终于在美国压力下屈膝。
    双边协定的条款明确地规定了美国在军事上完全控制“受援国”的苛刻条件。该协定第一条即规定：“美国与其他八国每一个国家的政府应互相供给，并对双方商定的其他国家政府供给装备、物资、服务或其他军事援助，以促进北大西洋区域的整体防御。”这个所谓“整体防御”，根据杜鲁门在批准“防御计划”时发表的声明中所说“各国军事资源的合作使用，和各个国家的专职化”，实际上就是把西欧各国的军事力量，完全置于美国的统一支配之下，而分配西欧各国以特定的军事任务。此外，各《双边协定》又规定“受援国”必须同意接受由美国海陆空军军官，以及国务院与“马歇尔计划”执行局的官员们所组成的“军事专家代表团”驻在该国，“视察援助之进展”。这种所谓“军事专家代表团”不仅将监督“军援”物资的使用与分配，并将监督“受援国”武装部队的训练与组织。同时代表团的浩大经费，还须由“受援国”负担。各《双边协定》也容许美国在“军事资源合作使用”的招牌下，享有进一步在经济上奴役“受援国”的特权。条款规定“受援国”“同意将美国感到缺乏而在某特定国家及其属地中可以取得的原料及半制品供给美国”；“在援助计划下供给的物资的专利权应受到保护”；“所供给的物资和装备在输入国免缴关税及国内税”。因此《双边协定》的签字，已使美帝国主义把所谓西欧“经济整体化”的侵略计划，向前推进了一步。但美帝国主义的狰狞面目和西欧国家反动政权的卖国行为，也因此更加暴露在西欧人民的面前。这不能不激起西欧人民日益广泛的有力反抗。
