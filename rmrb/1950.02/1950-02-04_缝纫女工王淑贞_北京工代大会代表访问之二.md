Seamstress Wang Shuzhen
Visit with a Representative to the Beijing Workers' Congress, Part Two
　　Eighteen-year-old Wang Shuzhen is one of the specially invited worker representatives to this Beijing Workers' Congress. Her production record for January 1950 was the highest among female workers in all of Beijing's garment factories: In the latter half of January, she completed an astonishing 120 sets of work (single garments) in eleven days. Apart from the record of 160 sets completed by male worker Yao Dianzhong of the Garment General Factory in twelve days, her production performance was the most outstanding.
　　Wang Shuzhen, who grew up in factories with her parents and started using machines at the age of eleven, comes from a poor working-class family. Both her parents were sewing workers.
　　Every day, Wang Shuzhen goes to work before dawn, always staying by her machine. As their union chairman, Wang Deshan, said, Wang Shuzhen just buries herself in hard work every day. She not only works fast, but more importantly, because she pays attention to quality, she often spends less time repairing her work than others, and her work always meets the standards.
　　When the reporter spoke with her about her seven years as a female worker and her feelings about being invited to participate in the congress, she lowered her head, pondered for a moment, and said in a tone of grief and indignation: "In the past, didn't I also work with my head bowed! But I often had to put up with being bullied and looked down upon because my family was poor. I couldn't get by without working like that. Once, because my father was sick from exhaustion and did a little bit of work badly, I submitted it for him, and the managers gave us a scolding, saying that neither of us planned on eating anymore. The factory always found fault with us workers. And every day, going to and from work, we had to be inspected by them, which made us hate them even more. But, after liberation, everything changed." At this point, she exhaled, and continued: "Now my situation is completely different. Not only am I no longer bullied, but I've also been elected a model and become a representative. How could we have participated in a congress in the past? The wages we received in the past never kept up with prices, and the money my father and I made was never enough for the family. But after liberation, our wages were converted to actual value based on the price of goods, and life is much better than before. My younger sisters and brothers are also attending the factory-run primary school! Before, the Kuomintang checked us more and more, and we tried to bring scraps of cloth and cotton home, but now no one checks us. We workers have all changed; even if there's a little bit of scrap cloth or thread left, we think about handing it in right away. When I think about how this is our own factory now, we are really happy."
　　Wang Shuzhen herself is very excited about being invited to participate in the congress. She said to the other workers with enthusiasm and humility, "I have never participated in any congress in my life. This time I am going to participate, so please tell me what you all have to say!"
　　Wang Shuzhen being specially invited to the Workers' Congress as a representative is a very good education for all the workers in the factory. Everyone has a new understanding: that doing more and doing well will surely be loved and respected by the people. Little assistant worker Jin Shuzhen said: "When I heard that Wang Shuzhen was participating in the congress, I felt that this was the most appropriate thing."
　　Finally, when the reporter asked her about her recent life in the factory, Wang Shuzhen blushed with excitement and said: "Let me tell you, I recently joined the Youth League too!"

　　缝纫女工王淑贞
    北京工代大会代表访问之二
    十八岁的女工王淑贞，是这次北京市工代大会的特邀工人代表之一。一九五○年元月她的生产记录是全北京被服工厂女工中最高的一个：在一月下半月，她在十一天中以惊人的成绩完成了一百二十套活（单服），这除了被服总厂的男工姚殿中在十二天中完成了一百六十套的记录外，她的生产成绩算是最卓越的了。
    从小跟着父母在工厂里生活，十一岁就上了机器的王淑贞，她的家庭是一个穷苦工人的家庭，父母都是缝纫工人。
    每天天还不亮，王淑贞就去上工，她总是不离开机器旁边。这正像她们的工会主任王德山所说的，王淑贞每天就是这样闷着头苦干，她不但做活快，而且最重要的是因为她注重质量，所以她经常比别人修理活的时间花费的少，做的活总是合乎规定的。
    当记者和她谈起七年来的女工生活，以及这次被邀请参加大会的感想时，她低着头沉思了一下，带着悲愤的语调说：“过去我不也是低着脖子干活吗！可是却经常要受气，给人家看不起，说我家里穷，不这样拚着命干就不行。一次因为父亲累病了，活做差了一点，我替父亲交上去，结果管理人员大骂了一顿，说我们爷俩都不打算吃饭了。厂方就是这样随时找我们工人的岔。而且每天上下工，都还要受到他们的检查，这使我们愈加憎恨他们。可是呢，解放了，什么都变了。”说到这里，她吐出了一口气，又接着说：“我现在情形完全不同了，不但不再受气，还当选了模范，当了代表，过去我们那能够参加大会呢？过去拿的工资也老是赶不上物价，我和父亲两人的钱总是不够家里用的。但解放后，我们的工资改为按实物折价，生活比过去好多了，妹妹弟弟也都上了工厂办的子弟小学啦！以前国民党他们愈是检查，我们愈是想法把碎布、棉花往家里带，可是这会子没人检查了，我们工人全变了，就是剩下一点布头线头，我们都想着赶紧交上去。一想起现在这是我们自己的工厂来，我们真高兴极了。”
    王淑贞自己对于这次被邀请参加大会，感到非常兴奋，她热情谦虚的跟别的工人说：“我一生一回也没有参加过什么大会，这回我去参加，你们大家有什么话，可得多给我说说啊！”
    王淑贞被工代大会特邀为代表，对全厂的工人都是一个很好的教育。大家有了这样新的认识：那就是做的多，做的好，定会受到人民的爱戴和尊敬。小副工金淑珍说：“听说王淑贞参加大会，我觉得这是最恰当也没有的了。”
    最后，记者问到她最近在工厂的生活情形，王淑贞涨红着脸兴奋地说：“告诉您，我最近也参加了青年团了呢”。
