　　Assisting Students in Effective Learning
    Chongde Middle School Establishes Winter Vacation Academy

    [This Newspaper Report] The Chongde Winter Vacation Academy, jointly organized by the Trade Union and Student Union of the private Chongde Middle School in Beijing, held its opening ceremony on the 6th. The main purpose of the academy is to cooperate with the Beijing Municipal Winter Vacation Youth Work Committee's youth lectures, mobilizing students to attend the lectures in an organized manner as much as possible, and then conduct discussions to improve their political understanding. In addition, there are cultural lessons for remedial studies and recreational activities. The high school cultural lessons are trigonometry and English. The junior high school lessons are arithmetic, algebra, geometry, chemistry, and English. Russian is taught in mixed high and junior high school classes. These are all scheduled for remedial study every morning. The afternoons are for recreational activities, including various ball games, practices or competitions, as well as play rehearsals, wall newspaper editing, and chess.

    Cultural lesson tutoring mainly relies on student mutual assistance. Many high school students have already signed up to tutor junior high school students.

　　辅助同学有效学习
    崇德中学成立寒假学园
    【本报讯】京市私立崇德中学工会和学生会，联合举办的崇德寒假学园，已于六日举行始业式。该园主要是配合本市寒假青年工作委员会的青年讲座，发动同学尽可能有组织地去听讲，然后进行讨论，借以提高政治水平。此外，还有文化课的补习和康乐活动。高中部的文化课是三角、英文。初中部是算术、代数、几何、化学、英文等。俄文为高初中混合班。这些都定在每日上午补习。下午为康乐活动，举行各种球类练习或比赛，以及排剧、编壁报、奕棋等。
    文化课补习主要依靠同学互助。高中同学已有很多签名愿为初中同学补习。
