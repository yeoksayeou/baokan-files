　　Excerpts from General Deng Xiaoping's Speech at the Chongqing People's Representative Conference

    General Deng Xiaoping, Political Commissar of the Second Field Army of the People's Liberation Army, was invited to speak at the Chongqing People's Representative Conference on January 28th. Excerpts are as follows:

    I. Where the Difficulties Lie

    The People's Liberation Army liberated Chongqing and then quickly liberated the greater Southwest. The Military Control Commission was established, and the People's Government was established, bringing light to the people of the Southwest. It is natural for the people to have great hopes for the Communist Party and the People's Government. However, almost two months have passed, and not many problems have been solved. So some people are beginning to doubt, and some are beginning to complain. Some people say: "The Communist Party has come, but why are we still suffering?" There is some truth to this complaint, because the people's trust in the government does not depend on its slogans, but on its actions. Since the People's Liberation Army and the People's Government have not done much in Chongqing, why shouldn't they be doubted? For example, it is still difficult to improve the lives of workers and public employees for the time being, it is difficult to fully restore factories for the time being, the problem of raw material sources and product sales is difficult to fully resolve for the time being, and many things that should be done are difficult to do all at once. These difficulties are real. Some of them are because we have not done our work well and should strengthen our work and improve our shortcomings. Some of them are indeed difficult to overcome for the time being, so we should explain the reasons to all sectors, so that everyone understands the situation, and then work together to gradually overcome them. We have indeed not done enough in this area during this period, and the resulting doubts and criticisms deserve the attention of all working comrades and should be accepted sincerely.

    There are many difficulties at present. What are the reasons?

    First, this is the result of the cruel plundering rule of imperialism for a hundred years, feudalism for thousands of years, and bureaucratic capitalism for decades. In the past, all economic institutions served imperialist aggression and the plundering of the feudal class and the bureaucratic bourgeoisie, and could only make the people increasingly poor and miserable. Today, we want to transform this semi-colonial economic structure into an economic structure that serves the country and the people, and into an economic structure that makes the country increasingly prosperous and the people increasingly happy. Of course, this is not an easy task.

    Now we have overthrown the concentrated political representative of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism, the Chiang Kai-shek dynasty, which only creates extremely favorable conditions for us to get rid of imperialism and feudalism economically. It does not mean that we have completely gotten rid of their shackles. In order to completely get rid of their shackles and change the economic face of our country, we cannot but encounter many difficulties, and we need to gradually overcome these difficulties.

    The imperialists know that we have difficulties, and they want to use our difficulties to force us to submit to them. Their method is blockade. This blockade has increased the difficulty of restoring our destroyed economy, and this has the same impact on our Southwest and Chongqing. The people of Shanghai and the coastal areas face up to the enemy's blockade and our difficulties. Under the leadership of the Communist Party and with the support of the whole country, they resolutely stand up to oppose the enemy's blockade and are not succumbed by difficulties. This is precisely the position that the Chinese people must take, and of course the people of our Southwest must also take the same attitude.

    Second, this is the result of the long-term war of treason and anti-people waged by the Chiang Kai-shek Kuomintang reactionaries, the concentrated representatives of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism. Taking Chongqing as an example, there is a huge war machine and a huge military industry here. The Kuomintang also carried out serious destruction when they withdrew, and the loss of power was the greatest. Now, to restore them, change them into peaceful industries that are beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood, or change them into practical defense industries, is certainly not an easy task. The private enterprises in Chongqing are also generally paralyzed, and like the state-owned enterprises, they are in urgent need of finding a way out. After we arrived in Chongqing, the business community expressed its difficulties, which are roughly: 1. Capital problem, requiring the government to provide loans; 2. Raw material problem, requiring the government to find a solution; 3. Product sales problem, requiring the government to purchase; 4. Labor-capital dispute problem, requiring the government to mediate; 5. Power problem, requiring the government to solve, etc. These difficulties are real. The workers and staff have fulfilled their responsibilities in the struggle to protect state property, and they demand to resume production and demand to ensure the minimum living standards, which is completely reasonable. Other sectors also have various types of demands, and these demands have been put forward in the three hundred and dozens of proposals of this conference. Most of these demands are reasonable. The question is, among so many questions, which are possible, which are impossible, which should be done today, which are impossible today and will have to wait until tomorrow, and which are reasonable but cannot be done in a period of time. We must distinguish the priorities and act according to our capabilities. Difficulties can only be overcome gradually. We cannot possibly do everything at once today. If we do everything at once, the result will be nothing.

    Third, we have taken over a large stall, including 900,000 Kuomintang troops who revolted, surrendered, and were captured, about 400,000 civil servants and other teachers and staff of the Kuomintang government, 100,000 employees of state-owned enterprises, plus 700,000 People's Liberation Army, a total of 2.1 million people. This is the lowest number, and it may exceed this number. These people must be fed. The amount of public grain we collect now is very large, and the peasant class is still the main burden bearer. But even such a large amount of public grain is not enough to feed 2.1 million people, and there is still a considerable deficit, and the urban people are also required to bear more burdens within the possible range. This matter is indeed a very big burden for us, which makes it difficult for us to extract a large amount of funds to restore and develop the people's economic undertakings in a considerable period of time.

    Fourth, our war has not finally ended, and Tibet in the Southwest has not been liberated, and the task of supporting the war is still arduous.

    Fifth, our propaganda on the policy, that is, the Common Program, is not in-depth enough, and some people still doubt the economic policies of the Communist Party and the People's Government, which makes it impossible to overcome some difficulties that could be overcome. We must do more publicity and explanation work on this point.

    II. Conditions for Overcoming Difficulties

    The above is where the difficulties lie. The policy for overcoming difficulties has been put forward in Commander Liu's report, and the conference has accepted this report, which provides a reliable guarantee for overcoming difficulties and building a new Chongqing. I will only talk about the conditions for overcoming difficulties. I will not talk about the fact that the war has basically ended, and we have begun to be able to concentrate our efforts to restore and develop production and gradually build our country according to our own will; I will not talk about the fact that China is indeed vast in land and abundant in resources, and has a large population, and the Chinese people are very hardworking, which makes it easier for us to overcome difficulties and build a brand-new New China; I will not talk about the help of the socialist Soviet Union and various new democratic countries, which have given and will continue to give us enthusiastic and friendly assistance, which will undoubtedly greatly shorten our construction process. I will only talk about three other issues.

    First, the government's policy. There are 15 articles in the Common Program on economic policy, and its fundamental policy is "to achieve the goal of developing production and prospering the economy through the policy of taking into account both public and private interests, benefiting both labor and capital, helping each other between urban and rural areas, and exchanging internally and externally." This policy was formulated by Chairman Mao, proposed by the Communist Party, and passed by the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, so the people of the whole country should implement it, and the Communist Party members have the responsibility to resolutely implement it.

    Since the policy of the Communist Party and the People's Government is affirmed, are all the problems solved? Not solved. The first is whether the people believe it or not. We always encounter this problem every time we go to a new area. The people have been deceived too much by the reactionary government, and the Kuomintang reactionaries have carried out many arbitrary propaganda, and the lessons of the history of the reactionary dynasty make them have to be wary. The responsibility of the Communist Party members and the staff of the People's Government is to show the doubters from the facts that the Common Program not only conforms to the common interests of the people of all strata, but also must be implemented conscientiously.

    Second, the efforts of self-reliance. The government's support for the private economy is mainly reflected in the policy, and secondly in various specific measures. Because the government is in great difficulties at present, it is actually difficult to give satisfactory answers to many legitimate demands, so the government should of course do its best, and more importantly, think of more ways by itself. We believe that some are very difficult and there are not many ways, but there are indeed many that can be thought of after everyone eliminates their concerns. We hope that they will actively think of ways as soon as possible. If those who have ways move, they will naturally bring those who have few ways to move, and even if there are a few who have no ways, it will be easy to solve. Taking capital as an example, government banks should provide some loans, but the number will not be very large, and mainly rely on the business community to think of ways. For example, economic undertakings that have no way out now and in the future can transfer their funds to undertakings that have prospects and are beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood; for example, we can try to encourage funds that have fled abroad to transfer back; for example, we can publicize some enlightened landlords to invest their funds in industry and commerce, which is also a very good way out for themselves. Taking raw materials as an example, those who relied on foreign countries in the past and now have no source should find new sources or consider new ways out; those who relied on foreign countries in the past and now have difficulty in sources should jointly find ways to eliminate possible difficulties. For example, the cotton in Xi'an, public and private yarn factories can organize joint procurement according to the method implemented in Shanghai. Taking products as an example, we should find ways to open up sales channels. One of the keys is to improve management, reduce costs, and improve output and quality to facilitate sales, because it is impossible and not allowed to establish tariff barriers in China. Only by making our own things better and cheaper than others can we have a way. This is also good for encouraging the improvement of technical level. As for the issue of the government purchasing products, this should be decided according to the specific situation. For example, if it is indeed because of temporary difficulties in turnover, and the government can help, the government should actively help it to solve the temporary difficulties; if this product is difficult to sell, or cannot be sold at all, it should not be required the government to bear this burden on behalf of private individuals.

    Third, facing the countryside. This is not only the way out for the business community, but also the task of the business community. A feudal and backward rural area cannot open up a broad path for the development of industry. If China does not liberate the peasants, who account for more than 80% of the country's population, from feudal oppression, it is impossible to imagine a new China. The peasants have contributed so much and borne so much burden for the revolution over the years that the city should be ashamed of it, so all sectors of the city should do some beneficial work for the peasants. The way to liberate the countryside is to mobilize and organize the peasants to carry out land reform; the other is for the city to serve the countryside, in order to achieve the purpose of mutual assistance between urban and rural areas. Land reform must be thoroughly implemented. Now we must actively prepare the conditions for land reform and strive to start distributing land in about two years. After completing this major task, we can establish a solid foundation for a modernized China. If agricultural production develops, it will be able to better accumulate funds for industry; if the peasants' living standards improve and their purchasing power increases, the way out for industry will also be solved, and the difficulties encountered now will not exist then. There are many ways for the city to serve the countryside. In terms of industry, we should study the needs of the peasants and consider our own production plans on the basis of reality; in terms of commerce, we should provide convenience to the peasants in both purchasing agricultural products and supplying the peasants with industrial products, and reduce the heavy exploitation of the peasants. Government departments should do more work, and each department has its own responsibility.

    III. Unity is Strength

    The above mainly talks about the problems in the economic aspect. There are also many difficulties in other aspects, such as in the cultural and educational aspects, and in the civil service aspects. We need to adopt the method of eating the meals of three people with five people to gradually overcome them. For example, the Kuomintang reactionary secret service agencies will never stop their sabotage activities, and they even attempt to use local gangsters to fight so-called guerrilla warfare. Imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism will not be willing to die, and we should be seriously vigilant. The arduous struggle has not ended, and it is only the beginning. Chairman Mao said that the current victory is only the first step in the Long March, which is the reason. In every step forward, we will encounter many difficulties, and we need to overcome the difficulties and eliminate the obstacles before we can continue to move forward. And the key to overcoming difficulties lies in the unity within the people.

    The camp of the Chinese New Democratic Revolution is four friends and three enemies in the country. The four friends are the working class, the peasant class, the petty bourgeoisie, the national bourgeoisie, and other patriotic elements, with the working class as the leader and the worker-peasant alliance as the foundation; the three enemies are imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism. Internationally, we stand on the side of the world people's democratic front headed by the Soviet Union and jointly oppose the world imperialist front headed by the United States. In our life and struggle, the first thing is to distinguish between the enemy and ourselves, to unite with friends, and to fight against enemies.

    The unity of friends is not without problems, because it is a union of four classes, and there is a certain degree of contradiction between classes, such as the labor-capital relationship, so we must work among friends and use the method of consultation to seek a reasonable solution in case of problems. The so-called unity is of course also principled, that is, to unite on the basis of the Common Program, and in case of disputes, we must also seek solutions on the basis of the Common Program. Whether the enemy and ourselves are distinguished, and whether the Common Program is implemented, are precisely our standards for distinguishing who is a friend and who is an enemy.

    For those in the enemy camp, we also hope that they will become aware. As long as they are willing to turn back, do not continue to be reactionary, and do not engage in conspiracies, the People's Government will also warmly help them reform and give them a way to live.

    If the four friends are united well, any enemy can be defeated and any difficulty can be overcome. The best form of unity is the People's Representative Conference or the People's Congress. The first People's Representative Conference in Chongqing City solved many problems, which is an obvious example. In the future, such meetings should be held about once every three months, and a consultative committee should be elected to carry out regular consultation work. We believe that if this work is done well, we will be able to continue to solve many problems. It must be pointed out here that one of the keys to whether the work of the People's Representative Conference and the Consultative Committee can be done well is that Communist Party members must be good at working with non-Party members with a humble and sincere attitude, which is worthy of the attention of Communist Party members.

    There is no doubt that under the leadership of the People's Representative Conference, our difficulties can be gradually overcome.

    There is no doubt that the people's new Chongqing will be built at an accelerated pace on the basis of the unity of the people of Chongqing.

　　重庆各界人民代表会议上
    邓小平将军讲话摘要
    【新华社北京二十三日电】人民解放军第二野战军政治委员邓小平将军，于一月二十八日应邀在重庆各界人民代表会议上讲话，摘要如下：
    一、困难的所在
    人民解放军解放了重庆，接着很快地在基本上解放了大西南。军管会成立了，人民政府成立了，给西南人民带来了光明，人民对共产党和人民政府抱有很大的希望，这是很自然的事。但是，时间过了快两个月了，问题解决的不多。于是有人怀疑起来了，也有人开始埋怨起来了。有人说：“共产党来了，我们为什么还是这样苦呢？”这种埋怨，有一部分的道理，因为人民对于政府的信赖，不是靠它的口号，而是看它的实际。解放军和人民政府到重庆后做事既然不多，为什么不应该加以怀疑呢？例如，职工和公教人员的生活一时尚难改善，工厂一时难于全部恢复，原料来源及产品推销问题一时难于全部解决，许多应办的事一时难于百废俱兴，这些困难是实在的，其中有些因为我们工作尚未做好，亟应加强工作，改善缺点；也有些确系一时难于克服，则应向各界说明理由，使大家明了情况，而后共同努力，逐渐地加以克服。对于这个工作我们这一时期确实做的不够，由此而引起的若干怀疑与批评，是值得所有工作同志加以注意并诚恳接受的。
    当前存在的困难很多，其原因何在呢？
    第一、这是百年来帝国主义、几千年来封建主义和几十年来官僚资本主义的残酷的掠夺统治的结果。过去一切经济机构都是服务于帝国主义的侵略和封建阶级、官僚资产阶级的掠夺的，对于人民只能是日益贫乏与痛苦。我们今天要把这个半殖民地的经济结构变成为服务于国家和人民的经济结构，变成为使国家日益强盛使人民日益幸福的经济结构，当然不是一件轻而易举的事情。
    现在我们打倒了帝国主义、封建主义和官僚资本主义的集中政治代表蒋介石王朝，只是为我们在经济上摆脱帝国主义、封建主义创造了极其有利的条件，并不等于我们已经完全摆脱了它们的羁绊。为了完全摆脱它们羁绊，改变我们国家的经济的面貌，不能不遭遇许多困难，需要我们逐渐地去克服这些困难。
    帝国主义者懂得我们有困难，想利用我们困难来迫使我们向其屈服，他们的办法就是封锁。这个封锁对于我们恢复破坏的经济，是增加了困难的，这对于我们西南和重庆的影响，也是同样的。上海和沿海人民正视了敌人的封锁和我们的困难，他们在共产党的领导下，在全国的支援下，坚决地站起来反对敌人的封锁，而不为困难所屈服，这正是中国人民必须采取的立场，我们西南人民当然也要采取同样的态度。
    第二、这是帝国主义、封建主义和官僚资本主义的集中代表者蒋介石国民党反动派统治进行卖国反人民的长期战争的结果。以重庆言，这里有一个庞大的战争机构和一个庞大的军事工业，国民党在撤退时还进行了严重的破坏，而以动力的损失为最大。现在要把它们恢复起来，改变成为有利国计民生的和平工业或改变成为切合实际的国防工业，当然不是一件轻而易举的事情。而重庆的私营企业也普遍呈现着瘫痪的状态，同国营企业一样，急待找寻出路。我们到重庆后，工商界说出了自己的困难，大约不外：一、资金问题，要求政府给以贷款；二、原料问题，要求政府给想办法；三、产品推销问题，要求政府予以收购；四、劳资纠纷问题，要求政府予以调解；五、动力问题，要求政府予以解决等等。这些困难是的确的。工人职员在保护国家财产的斗争中，尽了自己的责任，他们要求复业生产，要求保障最低的生活，这是完全合理的。其他各界也有各种各类的要求，这些要求已在这次大会的三百几十条提案中提出了，这些要求大多是合理的。问题是这样多，那些是可能办的，那些是不可能办的，那些是今天就应该办的，那些是今天还不可能而要等到明天办的，那些是虽然合理但在一个时期内还不能办的，必须分清先后缓急，量力而行。困难只能逐步克服，我们今天绝不可能百废俱兴。如果百废俱兴，其结果就一事无成。
    第三、我们接收了一个很大的摊子，其中包括起义、投诚和俘掳的国民党军队九十万人，国民党政府的公务人员和其他教职员约四十万人，国营企业的员工十万人，加上人民解放军七十万人，共二百一十万人，这是最低的数字，可能还要超过这个数目。这些人必须养。我们现在征收公粮的数目很大，农民阶级仍然是主要的负担者。但就是这样大的公粮数目还不能养活二百一十万人，还有相当大的赤字，还要求城市人民在可能范围内多出一些负担。这一件事情确是我们一个很大的包袱，这使得我们在一个相当时期内，很难抽出大量资金来恢复和发展人民的经济事业。
    第四、我们的战争还未最后结束，西南还有西藏没有解放，支援战争的任务仍然繁重。
    第五、我们的政策即共同纲领的宣传，还不深入，有些人还对共产党和人民政府的经济政策表示怀疑，致使若干可能克服的困难不能克服。这点尤须我们多作宣传解释工作。
    二、克服困难的条件
    以上就是困难的所在。克服困难的方针，在刘司令员的报告中提出了，大会已经接受了这个报告，这就对克服困难、建设新重庆提供了可靠的保障。我只谈一谈克服困难的条件。我不谈战争业已基本结束，我们已开始有可能集中力量来恢复与发展生产，逐步地按照自己的意志来建设我们的国家；不谈中国确实是地大物博，人口众多，加之中国人民是非常勤劳的，这使我们比较易于克服困难，建设一个崭新的新中国；也不谈社会主义苏联和各个新民主主义国家的帮助，它们已经给了和将继续给予我们以热情友谊的援助，这种援助无疑地将大大缩短我们建设的过程。我只说一说另外三个问题。
    第一、政府的政策。共同纲领中关于经济政策的纲领共十五条，其根本方针“是以公私兼顾、劳资两利、城乡互助、内外交流的政策，达到发展生产、繁荣经济的目的”。这个政策是毛主席制定，由共产党提出，而又经过人民政协会议所通过的，因此全国人民都应加以实行，共产党员更有坚决实行的责任。
    共产党和人民政府的政策既是肯定的，是不是问题都解决了呢？没有解决。首先是人民相信不相信的问题。我们每到一个新的地区，总会遇到这样的问题。人民受反动政府的欺骗太多了，加上国民党反动派进行了许多武断的宣传，反动王朝历史的教训使他们不能不怀有戒心。共产党员和人民政府工作人员的责任，就要从事实上给怀疑的人看：共同纲领不仅符合于各阶层人民的共同利益，而且是要认真实行的。
    第二、自力更生的努力。政府对于私营经济的扶植，主要地表现在政策上，其次才是在各种具体办法上。由于政府在目前的困难很大，事实上对于许多正当的要求，也难于给以完满的答复，所以，政府当然应尽力之所及，而更重要的还在于自己多想办法。我们相信有些是非常困难而且办法不多的，但确实有许多在大家打销顾虑之后，能够想到办法的，希望他们赶快积极起来想办法。有办法的活动起来了，很自然地会带着少办法的也活动起来，即使再有少数没有办法的，也就容易解决了。拿资金来说，政府银行应该举办一些贷款，但为数是不会很大的，主要还得靠工商界自己想办法。例如现在和将来都没有出路的经济事业很可以将他们的资金转到有前途又有利于国计民生的事业上去；又例如向外逃走的资金可以设法鼓励他们转回来；又例如可以宣传某些开明一点的地主把他们的资金投到工商业中去，这对他们本身也是一个很好的出路。拿原料来说，过去依赖外国，而现在又无来源的，应寻找新的来源或考虑新的出路；过去依靠外国而现在来源困难的，应共同设法消除可能消除的困难。例如西安的棉花，公私纱厂可以按上海实行的办法组织联合采购。拿产品来说，应设法开辟销路，其关键之一，是在于改善管理，减低成本，提高产量质量，以利推销，因为在国内是不可能也不允许建立关税壁垒的，只有使自己的东西比人家好比人家贱才有办法。这对于鼓励提高技术水平也是有好处的。至于由政府收购产品问题，这要根据具体情形来决定，例如确系因为临时周转上发生困难，而又为政府之力所能及的，政府应积极帮助其解除暂时的困难；又如这个产品是很难卖出，或根本不能卖出的，就不应要求政府来代替私人背上这个包袱。
    第三、面向农村。这不单是工商界的出路，也是工商界的任务。一个封建落后的农村，是不可能为工业开辟一个广阔的发展道路的。中国如果不把占全国人口百分之八十以上的农民从封建压迫下解放出来，是不能设想出现一个新中国的。农民多年来对于革命出力之大，负担之重，城市对之应有愧色，所以城市各界应该对农民做些有利的工作。解放农村的道路，一是发动与组织农民实行土地改革；一是城市为农村服务，以达到城乡互助的目的。土地改革一定要彻底实行，现在就是要积极准备土地改革的条件，力求在两年左右开始分配土地。完成了这件大事，就可以为现代化的中国树立巩固的基础。农业生产发展了，就能够更好地为工业积累资金；农民生活改善了，购买力增加了，工业的出路也就解决了，现在遇到的困难那时也就不会有了。城市为农村服务的道路很多，工业方面应该研究农民的需要，在现实的基础上，考虑自己的生产计划；商业方面无论在收购农产品方面或供给农民以工业品方面，都应给农民以便利，并减轻对农民的重重剥削。政府各部门更应做更多的工作，而且每一部门都有其自身的责任。
    三、团结就是力量
    前面讲的主要是经济方面的问题，其他方面的困难也都是很多的，例如文教方面，公务人员方面，都有很多困难，都需要采取三个人的饭五个人吃的办法，逐渐加以克服。又例如国民党反动特务机关绝不会停止其破坏活动，甚至他们还企图利用地方流氓分子打什么游击战争。帝国主义、封建主义、官僚资本主义不会甘心死亡的，应该引起我们严重的警惕。艰难的斗争并未完结，而且还只是开始，毛主席说现在的胜利，只不过是万里长征走了第一步，就是这个道理。在每一步的前进中，都要遇到不少的困难，都需要在克服了困难，扫除了障碍之后，才能继续前进。而克服困难的关键，则在于人民内部的团结。
    中国新民主主义革命的阵营，在国内是四个朋友三个敌人。四个朋友是工人阶级、农民阶级、小资产阶级、民族资产阶级和其他爱国分子，而以工人阶级为领导，以工农联盟为基础；三个敌人是帝国主义、封建主义和官僚资本主义。在国际上是站在以苏联为首的世界人民民主阵线方面，共同反对以美国为首的世界帝国主义阵线。在我们的生活和斗争中，第一件事就是分清敌我界线，对朋友要团结，对敌人要斗争。
    朋友的团结不是没有问题的，因为是四个阶级的联合，而阶级与阶级之间是有一定程度的矛盾的，如劳资关系就是这样，所以朋友之间要做工作，遇事用协商方法以求得合理的解决。所谓团结当然也是有原则的，就是说要在共同纲领的基础上团结起来，遇有争执也要在共同纲领的基础上获得解决。是否分清了敌我，是否执行共同纲领，正是我们鉴别谁是朋友，谁是敌人的标准。
    对于敌人营垒中的人，我们也希望他们觉悟，只要他们愿意回头，不继续反动，不做阴谋活动，人民政府也要热忱的帮助他们改造，并给生活之路。
    四个朋友团结好了，任何敌人都是可以打倒的，任何困难都是可以克服的。团结的最好形式，就是各界人民代表会议或人民代表大会，这次重庆市第一次开各界人民代表会议，解决了不少的问题，就是一个显然的例子。以后这样的会三个月左右要开一次，而且要选出一个协商委员会进行经常的协商工作。我们相信这个工作做好了，就一定能够继续解决许多问题。这里必须指出，人民代表会议和协商委员会的工作能否做好，其关键之一是共产党员要善于以谦逊诚恳的态度与党外人士共事，这是值得共产党员同志注意的。
    不用怀疑，在人民代表会议的领导下，我们的困难是能够逐渐克服的。
    不用怀疑，人民的新重庆，是会在重庆人民团结的基础上加速度地建立起来的。
