Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, 8th. The majority of areas in Guangdong Province have successively banned the use of Hong Kong dollars. On the 3rd of this month, the Guangzhou Military Control Commission issued a public notice prohibiting the circulation, use, or private trading of Hong Kong dollars and all foreign currencies, which immediately received an enthusiastic response from the people of the entire city. Representatives of the Guangzhou Municipal People's Representative Consultative Conference, representing people from all walks of life in the city, resolved to take action to help the government complete this correct measure that benefits the national economy and the people's livelihood. On the 5th, a propaganda team of approximately 7,000 people, including workers, teachers, students, women, and children, launched a campaign in the urban area to promote the ban on Hong Kong dollars and the sale of public bonds. Simultaneously with Guangzhou's ban on Hong Kong dollars, counties in central Guangdong such as Xinhui and Taishan also issued orders to ban the use of Hong Kong dollars within a specified period. Zhanjiang City had already stipulated on January 28th that the Renminbi would be the unit of account for all receipts, payments, and bookkeeping, prohibiting the circulation of gold, silver, and foreign currencies. In addition, the Chaoshan, Xingmei, Beijiang, and Dongjiang areas had already banned the circulation of Hong Kong dollars at the end of November last year. Over the past two months, Hong Kong dollars have disappeared from these areas, and the Renminbi has been widely circulated. The general methods adopted in various places when carrying out this work are: strict management of the market, outlawing underground banks; organizing broad publicity by workers and students; convening symposiums for people from all walks of life to explain the reasons for prohibiting the circulation of foreign currencies, which is to safeguard national sovereignty and the long-term interests of the people; People's Bank organizing work teams to go to the countryside with Renminbi, extensively establishing exchange points; and simultaneously coordinating with state-owned trading companies to control prices.

　　广东禁止港币流通
    各界人民热烈拥护并协助宣传
    【新华社广州八日电】广东省大部地区已先后禁止使用港币。本月三日，广州市军管会颁布了禁止港币和一切外币流通使用或私相买卖的布告，立即得到全市人民的热烈响应。市各界人民代表协商委员会代表全市各界人民，决以行动来帮助政府完成这一有益国计民生的正确措施。五日，包括工人、教师、学生、妇女和儿童等约七千人的宣传队伍，在市区展开了禁用港币和推销公债的宣传。与广州市禁用港币同时，粤中的新会、台山等县也颁布了限期禁止使用港币的命令。湛江市也已经在上月二十八日明令规定以人民币为一切收支和记账的计算单位，禁止金银、外币流通。此外，潮汕、兴梅、北江、东江等地区，则早在去年十一月底就已分别禁止港币流通。两个月来，这些地区港币已经绝迹，人民币已广泛流通。各地在进行这一工作时，一般采取的办法是：严格管理市场，取缔地下钱庄；组织广大的工人、学生进行广泛的宣传；召开各界人民座谈会，说明禁止外币流通是为了保障国家主权和人民的长远利益的道理；人民银行组织工作队携带人民币下乡，广泛设立兑换处；同时并配合以国营贸易公司的掌握物价。
