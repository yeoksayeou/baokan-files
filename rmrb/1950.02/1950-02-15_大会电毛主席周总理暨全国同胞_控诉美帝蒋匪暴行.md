Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, February 14th: The Shanghai People's Conference Against the Bombing Atrocities by U.S. Imperialists and Chiang Kai-shek Bandits and Memorial Service for the Deceased Compatriots, in order to accuse the bombing atrocities of U.S. imperialism and Chiang Kai-shek bandits, sent a telegram to Chairman Mao, Premier Zhou, and national compatriots. The telegram stated: "We, representing the six million citizens of Shanghai, with incomparable grief and anger, lodge a serious accusation against the atrocities of the U.S. and Chiang Kai-shek. The heinous Chiang Kai-shek gang, under the direct instigation of U.S. imperialism and with the participation of Japanese aggressor elements, used a large number of American-made aircraft and American-made bombs to carry out a frenzied bombing of our peaceful citizens of Shanghai on February 6th. Over a thousand innocent Shanghai workers and citizens from all walks of life were killed or wounded, more than 50,000 citizens were affected, and more than 1,000 houses were destroyed. All of Shanghai's water and electricity power equipment suffered serious damage. This barbaric, shameless, and inhumane criminal act is another blood debt owed by U.S. imperialism and the Chiang Kai-shek gang to the people of Shanghai! We, the people of Shanghai, fully recognize that such a desperate struggle by the enemy on the verge of death can only accelerate its own inevitable demise and cannot prevent the victorious advance of our people's revolution. We, the people of Shanghai, have never been intimidated by any enemy attack or threat, and have never bowed our heads in the face of any difficulty. No matter how the enemy bombs and destroys, we will continue to carry forward the glorious revolutionary tradition of the Shanghai people in the past, strengthen unity, and, under the correct leadership of the great people's leader Chairman Mao and the Central People's Government of the Chinese Communist Party, with the enthusiastic support of the people of the whole country, resolutely overcome the temporary difficulties imposed on us by the enemy, and step up support for the front, strive for the speedy liberation of Taiwan and the coastal islands, thoroughly eliminate the remaining forces of the Chiang Kai-shek bandits, avenge the dead compatriots, and redouble our efforts to build a new Shanghai." The conference also sent a telegram to the people of the world, stating: "We, representing the six million citizens of Shanghai, with incomparable grief and indignation, lodge a serious accusation to the righteous people of the world against the atrocities of U.S. imperialism and the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang! We firmly believe that righteous people all over the world, especially the American people, must be equally indignant. This desperate death throe of the Chiang Kai-shek gang can only accelerate its inevitable demise and cannot prevent the victorious advance of our heroic people. Under the leadership of the great leader Chairman Mao Zedong, the Central People's Government, and the Chinese Communist Party, and with the support of the righteous people of the world, the people of Shanghai will make the greatest efforts to overcome difficulties, support the front, fight for the liberation of Taiwan, and fight for the construction of a new Shanghai and a new China!"
