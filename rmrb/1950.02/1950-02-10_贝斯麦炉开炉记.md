　　A Record of the Bessemer Converter's Inauguration

　　The Bessemer converter was built by the Japanese invaders before their surrender. This type of furnace is more flexible to use than an electric arc furnace and can directly use molten iron from the blast furnace to make steel (electric arc furnaces can only use scrap steel). The Japanese invaders tried to use this furnace twice, but both times failed. During the Kuomintang rule, no one even bothered with it. Thus, the Bessemer converter was abandoned and became a piece of junk. After liberation, under the leadership of the Communist Party and the democratic government, the factory workers' consciousness was raised, and their enthusiasm and creativity in production were greatly stimulated. In order to complete the production tasks assigned by their superiors, they decided to repair the furnace. After everyone's research, they finally discovered the main reasons why the Japanese invaders failed in their two attempts to use the furnace: first, the front furnace should not have been installed too far from the blast furnace; second, they had too high expectations in the proportioning of materials, and did not understand the composition of the coke they were using. Originally, one kilogram of coal could only melt three kilograms of iron, but they wanted to melt four or four and a half kilograms of iron. The ratio of coke to iron was too different, resulting in too long an air draft and insufficient combustion temperature, which caused the melted solution to become a slurry-like nodule and unable to flow out of the furnace mouth. After identifying the problems, they began to repair the furnace, focusing on these issues.

　　The initial experiments were unsuccessful. Everyone had never used this type of furnace before, especially the inability to properly control the suction fan. In addition, the furnace wall was too thick, the internal airflow was small, and the temperature was not high enough, which caused the molten iron to freeze and some to become nodules. But everyone was not discouraged and said, "Let's accept this experience and try again! We must eliminate the nodules!"

　　The workers in the blast furnace group and the Bessemer converter group, in order to complete the task quickly, first challenged the ingot casting group and the ladle handling group: "Let's compete to see who can do it faster!" The workers in the ingot casting group and the ladle handling group immediately accepted the challenge: "As soon as the Bessemer converter produces molten steel, we will immediately cast ingots and handle the ladles." Following closely, the material transportation, crushing, and overhead crane groups also put forward conditions and volunteered to join the challenge. A wave of competition was set off throughout the factory.

　　In the competition, the workers were all as lively as dragons and tigers. Yao Yugang, a worker in the blast furnace group, climbed to the bottom of the blast furnace to rush repairs, and his whole body was extremely hot, but he still insisted on working. Zheng Shiheng, a worker in the Bessemer converter group, felt that as the group leader, he should take the lead, so he braved the high heat of the furnace hood and climbed onto the Bessemer converter to add ferrosilicon. His cotton clothes were scorched by the fire, but he still did not come down. When he finished his work and came down, the fire had already burned through to his innermost shirt. Everyone splashed water on him to put it out.

　　Through eight trials, until the official opening of the furnace, Wang Leji, the director of the steelmaking plant, and engineer Zhao Naibin, stayed with the workers to research and guide, and even climbed to the top of the furnace to help with charging, persisting in their work with the workers amidst the sparks. Once, they stayed with the workers for thirty hours without leaving work.

　　The rapid and smooth repair of the Bessemer converter is inseparable from the fact that after the implementation of democratic management in the factory, the workers' belief in being masters of their own affairs was enhanced, their political consciousness was rapidly improved, and the Party members and Youth League members took the lead. As one of the workers in the Bessemer converter group said: "The Japanese and the Kuomintang couldn't get this furnace to work, but today, under the leadership of the Communist Party, we can get it running!"

　　贝斯麦炉开炉记
    贝斯麦炉是日寇在投降前建造的。这种炉使用起来比弧热式电炉灵便，可以直接由化铁炉取铁水炼钢（弧热炉只能用废铁炼钢）。在日寇手里时，这个炉子被试用过两次，都失败了。在国民党统治时期，更没人过问它。于是贝斯麦炉就荒废下来，成了个废物。解放后，该厂职工在共产党和民主政府领导下，觉悟提高了，大大发挥了生产积极性与创造性。他们为了完成上级所给予的生产任务，决定把这个炉子修整好。经过大家的研究，终于发现日寇两次试用这个炉子都失败的主要原因：第一、不应该将前炉装置得离化铁炉太远；第二、在配料上他们的欲望太高，不了解所用焦炭的成分，本来一公斤炭只能化六斤铁，他们却要化八、九斤铁。焦炭与铁的比例相差太大，以致过风太长，燃烧温度不够，使化出的溶液变成浆状结核，不能流出炉口。找出它的毛病后，就针对着这个毛病着手修理。
    开始试验时没有成功。大家过去没用过这种炉，尤其对掌握吸送风机不得法，再加上这个炉的炉墙太厚，里风小，温度不够高，以致使铁水冻凝，有的成了结核。但大家毫不灰心，都说：“接受这次经验，再来！一定把结核消除！”
    化铁炉组贝斯麦炉组的工友们，为了迅速完成任务，首先向造块组、取锅组提出挑战：“比着干，看谁干的快！”造块组、取锅组工友立刻应战：他们“贝斯麦炉出了钢水马上就造块取锅。”紧跟着运料、砸碎、天车等组也都纷纷提出条件，自动应战。竞赛热潮就在全厂掀起来了。
    在竞赛中，工友个个像生龙活虎。化铁炉工人姚玉刚爬到化铁炉炉底去抢修，全身烤的非常难受，但仍坚持工作。贝斯麦炉工人郑士恒感到自己是小组长应当起带头作用，就冒着炉罩的高热，爬上贝斯麦炉去添矽铁，棉衣被火烤着了，他仍然不下来，当他工作完了下来时，火已经烧到他最里面的衬衣，大家向他身上泼水才扑灭了。
    经过八次试验，直到正式开炉为止，该厂的炼钢厂主任王乐基和工程师赵乃斌，始终和工人们在一起研究、指导，甚至也爬到炉子最上层帮助投炉，在火花四溅中和工友们一起坚持着工作。有一次他们和工友们在一起三十个钟头没有下班。
    贝斯麦炉之所以能够这样迅速而顺利的修复成功，是与该厂施行民主管理后，工人当家作主的信念增强，政治觉悟迅速提高，党团员积极带头分不开的。正如贝斯麦炉组的一个工人所说：“日本人、国民党都开用不了这个炉，可是在今天，在共产党领导下，我们就能开动它了！”
