    【新华社北京二十一日电】据法新社东京讯：麦克阿瑟总部法律组十六日宣布：经荷兰军事法庭在印尼判决犯有战争罪行，而于一月二十三日自雅加达遣返东京的六百八十四名日本战犯，其中约有一百名将于日内自巢鸭监狱获释。释放是根据麦克阿瑟去年所擅自订定的《行为良好，减轻罪行》条例。法律组并宣布：根据上项“条例”，今年将另有数十名日本战犯获释。
    又据电通社悉尼十六日讯：澳大利亚联邦政府在美国的压力下，决定释放扣押在东京三个犯有战争暴行罪的日本将级军官，并“考虑”释放其他九十名日本战犯。这个消息透露后，已引起全澳的抗议浪潮。澳大利亚人民对犯有虐待澳大利亚人罪行的战犯在日本“失踪”的消息，亦极注意。
