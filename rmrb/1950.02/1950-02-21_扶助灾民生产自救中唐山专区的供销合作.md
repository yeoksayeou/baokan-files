Tangshan Special District's Supply and Marketing Cooperatives in Aiding Disaster Victims' Production and Self-Salvation
Zheng Yi Shan Zhiyou

After the North China Cooperative Conference in April 1949, the public-owned stores in Tangshan Special District, Hebei Province, and its counties began to reorganize into mass-based supply and marketing cooperatives on their existing foundations. First, they absorbed the experience of Lin Nancang in Yutian County, formerly in the Jidong District, in establishing cooperatives. They focused on establishing two supply and marketing cooperatives in Xingcheng Town in Qianxi County and Sijizhuang in Luannan County, and a consumer cooperative for workers and citizens in Changli Chengguan District. By August, in four months, the three cooperatives had absorbed a total of 3,750 members. Later, due to continuous rain causing disasters, the special district and county governments and the Party actively organized the masses for production to help them achieve self-salvation. Starting in October of last year, thanks to the efforts of all cadres, the work of the cooperatives developed rapidly. As of the end of December, 32 supply and marketing cooperatives had been established throughout the district, with 63,330 members and an increase in share capital equivalent to 788,536 jin of millet. This laid a fully favorable foundation for the continued development of cooperative undertakings in the district in the future.

After the hurricane and flood disaster in October last year, the special district supply and marketing cooperative signed a contract with the Rehe Province Grain Company to exchange 300,000 bolts of homespun cloth and 10 million jin of salt for 40 million jin of millet. This opened up sales channels for the well-established textile production in the district, organized women to spin, and purchased their finished products at a certain profit. For poor households that could not afford raw materials, they were provided with loans of foreign yarn and cotton. In the two key areas of Yutian Nine and Ten Districts, which were the most severely affected by the disaster, 15,485 jin of cotton were supplied to extensively mobilize women to spin yarn. In three months, calculating a profit of five jin of millet per jin of homespun yarn, a total of 15,485 jin of homespun yarn was purchased, and the masses earned a total of 77,425 jin of millet. The supply and marketing cooperatives also used 2,362 bundles of foreign yarn and the purchased homespun cloth as capital to mobilize 1,500 iron-wheeled looms for weaving in the towns of Ya Hongqiao and Woluogu. They also used 740,000 jin of miscellaneous grains to purchase 17,697 bolts of homespun cloth. Calculating a profit of five jin of millet per bolt of cloth, the disaster victims earned a total of 70,788 jin of millet. According to statistics from seven severely affected counties, including Yutian and Qianxi, 4,261 looms (including 1,771 iron-wheeled looms and 2,443 wooden looms) were organized for weaving in three months. Based on an average of one bolt of cloth woven per day on an iron loom and one bolt of cloth woven every five days on a wooden loom, the entire district could weave 2,261 bolts of homespun cloth per day. Each bolt of cloth requires three jin of homespun yarn, and the labor cost is 15 jin of millet. Including the weaving labor cost of five jin of millet, the masses can earn 20 jin of millet per bolt of cloth. Weaving mixed yarn requires only two jin of homespun yarn but can still earn 15 jin of millet. Although the mobilization was relatively late throughout the district, 34,612 bolts of homespun cloth were purchased in three months, and the disaster victims earned 519,180 jin of millet. This not only played a significant role in helping disaster victims achieve self-salvation through production but also enabled the smooth development of the work of the cooperatives. Taking Yutian County as an example, 6,558 members were developed in the organization of weaving. Luannan County also established four grassroots cooperatives based on organizing 3,217 women to participate in weaving, developing more than 2,000 members.

In order to organize disaster victims throughout the district to develop diverse side-line occupations and handicraft production, in the process of requisitioning cotton, 280 cotton gins were organized, with 560 people participating in cotton ginning. Each gin can gin 150 jin of seed cotton per day, and the wage is 13 to 15 jin of millet. With each gin being shared by two workers, each cotton gin worker can earn 6.5 to 7.5 jin of millet per day, which can sustain the lives of four people. In the 57 villages near Lin Nancang Town in Yutian County, about 38,500 people were organized to participate in mat weaving. The Lin Nancang Supply and Marketing Cooperative and the Mat Industry Company jointly purchased 94,088 mats, exchanging them for 940,880 jin of corn. After deducting the cost of six jin of corn per mat, the mat weavers still had a net surplus of 376,352 jin of corn. In addition, the masses were organized to engage in transportation. 117 rubber-tired carts from Fengrun, Fengnan, and Qianxi counties and 60 rubber-tired carts from Funing and Qian'an counties were organized to transport goods, transporting a total of 900,000 jin of grain back and 150,000 jin of salt and 162,000 bolts of homespun cloth (including 127,388 bolts of old cloth stored by the commissioner's office). Calculating an average of 5,000 jin of goods transported per cart and earning a freight fee of 25%, the total freight earned was 372,500 jin of grain. In addition, 910 iron-wheeled carts were organized in Leting County to transport salt and seafood for external sales. In 40 days, a total of 910,000 jin of millet was earned. In three months, according to the incomplete statistics of the above-mentioned main side-line occupations and handicraft production, the disaster victims throughout the district earned more than 2,268,000 jin of millet, laying the foundation for leading the masses to overcome the disaster in the coming winter and spring.

However, in terms of the extremely serious disaster situation in the district, this income is still far from solving the difficulties of hundreds of thousands of disaster victims lacking food for two to three months. Moreover, other side-line occupations and handicraft production throughout the district, such as charcoal burning, gold panning, papermaking, medicinal herb collecting, willow weaving, and saltpeter sweeping, have not been fully developed, and the oil pressing industry is also at a standstill. The textile industry has not yet achieved balanced development in the disaster areas. Therefore, there are several important issues that need to be resolved urgently.

1. From the current leadership of supply and marketing cooperatives at all levels, there is still a widespread purely business-oriented viewpoint. They only decide their business activities based on the profit and loss of one place and one cooperative in isolation, and they cannot actively and concretely help the masses solve production difficulties. For example, saltpeter sweeping and charcoal burning have a good foundation in the disaster-stricken areas along the Great Wall, and the masses are also eager to produce; however, the supply and marketing cooperatives have never actively found sales channels for the masses, nor have they supported the masses' production based on the principle of purchasing during slack months and selling during peak months. Therefore, it has not been able to develop until now. In the future, under the overall production plan of the government, everything that the supply and marketing cooperatives do should be based on the basic principle of organizing the masses for production and self-salvation to carry out cooperative undertakings.

2. The leadership direction of the special district supply and marketing cooperative has a laissez-faire style of work. The work assigned lacks inspection and supervision, and the lower-level cooperatives do not report to the higher levels on time, forming a situation where the upper and lower levels do not communicate and do not understand each other's situations. There is also no clear reward and punishment system, which hinders the development of business. At the same time, there is insufficient understanding of the various exchange contracts signed. For example, the exchange contract with the Rehe Province Grain Company for 300,000 bolts of cloth was not completed within the time limit after the quota of homespun cloth was distributed to the counties, nor was it inspected and supervised, delaying it until the end of December, when only 34,612 bolts were completed. This kind of thinking that does not pay attention to disaster relief production is something that should be overcome immediately.

3. Some local supply and marketing cooperatives, because their business operations are limited to simply serving members, have not yet realized that our cooperative undertakings have just been established, and most farmers have not yet been organized by us economically. If we want to lead the entire people to overcome the serious disaster and do not care about organizing non-members to produce, it is obviously wrong. For example, in the severely flooded Thirteenth District of Fengrun, cooperative societies began to be organized as early as November. Because of the erroneous emphasis on serving only members, and that business could not start until there were 2,000 members, very few people bought shares by the end of November, making it impossible to develop the district's well-established textile and rope-making production. It was not until the beginning of December, after the county party committee inspected and corrected the situation, that the organization began. The Angezhuang District Supply and Marketing Cooperative in the Second District of Luan County does not trade with non-members in order to develop members. These have seriously hindered the development of self-salvation through production. Of course, in organizing production, guaranteeing the difference in profits between members and non-members is also correct and absolutely necessary.

4. At present, the organizational structure of cooperative societies at all levels is not sound, and the quality of cadres is very weak, which also affects the inability to carry out business. Therefore, in the future, it is necessary to equip stronger cadres to be responsible for leadership. In addition, cadres of cooperative societies at all levels still have the mentality of waiting for sales channels. For example, the Angezhuang District Supply and Marketing Cooperative in the Second District of Luan County is in a very serious disaster situation. The local masses mostly rely on willow weaving for a living. The cooperative society not only failed to find sales channels for the masses, but also failed to organize the masses to produce, so that the local willow weaving industry has not yet been developed. Therefore, in the future, it is necessary to strengthen the ideological education of cooperative society cadres, give full play to the enthusiasm of serving the people, actively open up sales channels for the masses, and organize production in order to promote the universal development of side-line occupations and handicraft production that are still stagnant throughout the district.

　　扶助灾民生产自救中唐山专区的供销合作
    郑毅　单志友
    一九四九年四月间华北合作会议后，河北省唐山专区及各县公营商店即开始在现有基础上改组为群众性的供销合作社。首先吸收了原冀东区玉田县林南仓的建社经验，有重点的在迁西县兴城镇和滦南县司集庄建立了两个供销社，在昌黎城关区建立了一个职工市民消费社。到八月份，四个月间，三个社共吸收了社员三千七百五十名。以后由于霪雨为灾，专区各级政府与党为帮助群众生产自救，便积极组织群众生产，从去年十月开始，由于全体干部的努力，使合作社工作获得了迅速发展。截至十二月底，在全区范围内已建立了三十二个供销社，发展社员六万三千三百三十名，增加股金折小米七十八万八千五百三十六斤。给全区今后合作事业的继续开展，准备了充分有利的条件。
    去年十月全区经过飓风洪水灾期之后，专区供销社即与热河省粮食公司，订立以土布三十万匹、食盐一千万斤交换小米四千万斤的合同，给全区素有基础的纺织生产打开了销路，组织起妇女纺织，并按一定利润收购其成品。对买不起原料的贫困户，并贷给洋纱、棉花。对灾情最严重的玉田九、十两重点区，更供给棉花一万五千四百八十五斤，广泛发动妇女纺线。在三个月中以每斤土线五斤小米的利润计算，共收购土线一万五千四百八十五斤，群众共赚小米七万七千四百二十五斤，供销社并以洋纱两千三百六十二捆和收购的土布一并贷给鸦洪桥、窝洛沽两镇妇女作资本，发动起一千五百架铁轮机织布。并以杂粮七十四万斤，收购土布一万七千六百九十七匹，按每匹布赚小米五斤计算，灾民共收入小米七万零七百八十八斤。据玉田、迁西等七个重灾县的统计，三个月中组织了四千二百六十一架机子（包括铁轮机一千七百七十一架、木机二千四百四十三架）进行纺织。按平均每天铁机织布一匹木机五天织布一匹计算，全区每天可织出土布二千二百六十一匹；每织成一匹布需要纺土线三斤，手工工资十五斤米，连织布手工工资五斤米，一匹布即能使群众赚得小米二十斤。织混合线的只需纺二斤土线但也能赚小米十五斤。虽然全区由于发动较晚，但在三个月内也收购了土布三万四千六百一十二匹，灾民赚得小米五十一万九千一百八十斤。不但对灾民生产自救起了不少作用，也使合作社工作得到顺利地开展。以玉田县为例，在组织纺织中就发展社员六千五百五十八名。滦南县也在组织三千二百一十七名妇女参加纺织的基础上，结合着建立了四个基层社，发展社员达两千多名。
    为了组织全区灾民开展多种多样的副业和手工业生产，在征棉过程中，又组织轧花车二百八十辆，五百六十人参加轧花。每辆车子一天能轧籽棉一百五十斤，工资十三斤至十五斤小米，以每辆车两个工人均分，每个轧花工人每天能赚六斤半至七斤半小米的工资，能维持四个人的生活。在玉田县林南仓镇附近的五十七个村中，组织了约三万八千五百人参加织席生产，由林南仓供销社和席业公司共同收购席子九万四千零八十八片，共换得玉米九十四万零八百八十斤，扣除每片席成本玉米六斤，席民还可净剩玉米三十七万六千三百五十二斤。此外并组织群众进行运输事业。组织了丰润、丰南、迁西三县一百一十七辆胶皮车及抚宁、迁安两县六十辆胶皮车包运，共运回粮食九十万斤，运出盐十五万斤，土布十六万二千匹（内有专署旧存公布十二万七千三百八十八匹），每辆车平均以运货五千斤赚路费百分之二十五计算，共获运费三十七万二千五百斤粮食。另外还在乐亭县组织了九百一十辆铁轮车运盐和海虾往外推销，在四十天中共赚小米九十一万斤，三个月中，仅据以上所组织的几种主要的副业和手工业生产的不完全统计，就使全区灾民收入了小米二百二十六万八千多斤，给领导群众渡过今冬明春的灾荒打下基础。
    但就全区极端严重的灾情来说，这点收入，距解决全区几十万灾民缺粮两个月至三个月的困难，还相差很远。而且在全区范围内其他副业和手工业生产：如烧炭、淘金、造纸、采药、柳编、扫硝等都还没有得到充分的开展，榨油业也处在停顿状态，纺织业还没有在灾区内获得平衡发展。因此，目前还存在着几个重要问题急待解决。
    一、从目前各级供销社的领导上看，还普遍地存在着单纯业务观点，只孤立地从一地一社的盈亏来决定自己的业务活动，不能主动具体地帮助群众解决生产困难。如扫硝、烧炭等生产，在长城沿线的灾荒地区都很有基础，群众也迫切要求生产；但供销社从未积极给群众找销路，同时也未本着淡月收购、旺月出卖的原则，支持群众生产。所以直到现在还未能开展。今后供销社在政府整个生产计划下，一切要本着为组织群众生产自救的基本方针开展合作事业。
    二、专区供销社的领导方向存在着放任自流的作风，布置的工作缺乏检查督促，下级社也不按期向上级作报告，形成上下不通气，互不了解情况。更没有明确的奖励和惩罚制度，阻碍了业务的开展。同时对所订立的各种交换合同认识不足，如与热河省粮食公司订立的三十万匹布的交换合同，在把土布数字分配给各县后，既未限期完成，又未进行检查督促，拖延到十二月底才仅仅完成三万四千六百十二匹。这种对灾民生产救灾不重视的思想，是应当立即克服的。
    三、个别地区的供销社，由于在经营业务方面局限于单纯为社员服务，尚未认识到我们的合作事业刚在建立，大部农民还没有被我们从经济上组织起来，要想领导全体人民渡过严重的灾荒，不关心组织非社员生产，显然也是错误的。如水灾严重的丰润十三区，早在十一月即开始组织合作社，因为错误地强调单为社员服务，而且非到两千社员不能开始营业，因此到十一月底还很少有人入股，无法使全区有基础的纺织打绳等生产开展起来。到十二月初，经过县委检查纠正后，才开始进行组织。滦县二区安各庄区供销社为了发展社员，就不和非社员交易。这些都严重地阻碍了生产自救的开展。当然在组织生产中，保证利润上社员与非社员的区别，也是正确和完全必要的。
    四、目前各级合作社的组织机构不健全，干部质量很弱，也影响业务不能展开。因此今后必须配备较强干部负责领导。此外各级合作社干部尚存在着等待销路的思想，如滦县二区安各庄区供销社，全区灾荒很严重。而当地群众大部依靠编柳为生，合作社不但未给群众找出销路，也未组织群众生产，所以使当地的柳编业直到目前还未开展。因此今后必须加强合作社干部的思想教育，高度发挥为人民服务的热情，积极地为群众打开销路，组织生产，以推动全区尚在停滞的副业和手工业生产获得普遍展开。（附图片）
