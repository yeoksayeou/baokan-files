　　A. Tolstoy's "Peter the Great"
　　The play "Peter the Great," which was staged in this city, is adapted from the original work of the great Soviet historical novelist A. Tolstoy. It is a work with a high degree of historical accuracy.

　　"Peter the Great" was the first historical novel that A. Tolstoy wrote after finishing "1918." From his experience in describing the early days of the new socialist revolution, he gained a new feeling for the world and the times. Starting from the lofty viewpoint of the socialist revolution, he handled his subject matter and successfully created a faithful picture of the history of that period.

　　In this work, A. Tolstoy, through artistic images, very sharply expressed Lenin's words about Peter the Great's struggle against violence with violence. At the same time, with outstanding power, he not only depicted the typical image of an excellent reformer of the Russian state, but also the typical image of the excellent and talented Russian people. He showed the creative power of the people in building a new motherland and showed the direction from barbarism to progress.

　　Naturally, the more important significance of "Peter the Great" lies in its social content. Here, we can see how Peter the Great expanded his circle of friends, how he gathered people around him, and how he sought assistants for himself.

　　At that time, Russia was in an era of actively learning from Western Europe, and A. Tolstoy did not miss the depiction of this phenomenon at all. As in "Peter the Great," he described important figures such as the family of Iman Alchimich Purovkin: Iman Alchimich himself was a former serf, a servant of the Oregov Grand Duke, his eldest son, second son, daughter, and the rest of his family. Peter the Great promoted them to positions of state rule, regardless of their past, making them loyal servants of his class, and with their help, transformed the people of his own class.

　　In addition to these, A. Tolstoy more keenly noticed the power of the new socio-economic institutions and the task of the Russian people using the masses to "transform" the ancient Russian ruling class. Here, he profoundly showed the process of overcoming the stubbornness of reactionary aristocratic figures: Peter the Great relied on the assistants he promoted from the lower classes to successfully complete this task.

　　"Peter the Great" is filled with a high degree of patriotic enthusiasm. With this enthusiasm, it elaborates on the most glorious page of Russian history; with the help of the great national character of Russia, it cultivates the patriotic sentiment of everyone.

　　Ａ·托尔斯泰的《彼得大帝》
    曾在本市上演的《彼得大帝》，是根据苏联伟大历史小说家Ａ·托尔斯泰的原著改编的。它是一部具有高度的历史的正确性的作品。
    《彼得大帝》是Ａ·托尔斯泰写完《一九一八年》后的第一部历史小说。他在描写新社会主义革命初期的经验上，获得了对世界和时代的新的感觉，他从社会主义革命的崇高观点出发，处理自己的主题，成功地创造出那时期的历史的忠实的画面。
    在这一部作品里，Ａ·托尔斯泰通过了艺术形象，非常尖锐地表现了列宁所说的彼得大帝以暴力反对暴力的斗争。同时，他更以卓越的力量，不仅描写出了俄罗斯国家的优秀的改革者的典型，而且也描写出了优秀的天才的俄罗斯人民的典型。他表现出了人民在建立新祖国中的创造力量，表现出了从野蛮走向进步的方向。
    自然，《彼得大帝》更主要的意义，还在于它的社会的内容上。在这里，我们可以看到彼得大帝是怎样在扩展朋友，怎样收罗自己周围的人们，怎样给自己寻求助手。
    在当时，俄国正是处于积极向西欧学习的时代，Ａ·托尔斯泰丝毫没有放过这种现象的描写。如在《彼得大帝》中，他描写了重要的人物有伊曼·阿尔契米奇·浦洛甫金的家属：伊曼·阿尔契米奇自己是个旧日的农奴，俄勒古夫大公的仆人，他的大儿子，二儿子，女儿和其余的人们。彼得大帝提拔他们担任了国家的统治职位，一点也不管他们的过去，使他们成为自己一阶级的忠仆，在他们的帮助下，改造自己一阶级的人。
    除了这些，Ａ·托尔斯泰更敏锐地注意到新的社会经济机构的力量，注意到俄罗斯人民用民众“改造”古老的俄罗斯统治阶级的任务。在这里，他深刻地显示了克服反动的贵族人士中的顽固性的过程：彼得大帝依靠他从下层民众中提拔出来的助手，才能顺利地完成了这一任务。
    在《彼得大帝》中，充满着高度的爱国热情。它带着这种热情，阐扬了俄罗斯历史最光荣的一页；借助于俄罗斯伟大的民族性格，培养着每个人的爱国情绪。（本文材料根据布尔曹夫作、胡琴棣译“Ａ·托尔斯泰的历史小说”）
