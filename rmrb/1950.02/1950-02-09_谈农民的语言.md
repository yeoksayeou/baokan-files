　　Talking about the Language of Peasants
    Duānmù Hóngliáng

　　In the rural areas of the new China, where people have turned over, every household, whether it is old or young, is speaking a new type of language, a language that no one has ever spoken in the past thousands of years. These languages are growing out of the new life, are the fighting peasants of the New Democratic China, combined with Mao Zedong's thoughts and actions, in order to properly convey the meaning in their hearts, only then were these languages found. Linked with the peasants' own ideas, and absorbing scientific and revolutionary words, the people created a new language of wisdom.

　　Language is the most complete tool for conveying ideology, without it, one cannot convey any fighting will. Without scientific, organized, revolutionary language, one will not be able to convey scientific revolutionary truth. In this great land revolution movement in the suburbs, in the first batch of 77 villages mobilized by land reform work, 109,404 peasants participated in this epoch-making and strong struggle. In 50 days, through enlightenment, organization, anti-local tyrant, class division, adjustment and distribution of land, farm tools, food, and housing revolutionary struggles, the peasants raised their class consciousness and recognized the truth of the revolution. They began to create and learn new vocabularies, conveying their highly revolutionary thoughts and fighting emotions.

　　The old days are gone forever. New languages grow in the new days, like grass seeds that have been hit by spring, all bursting with buds. All 110,000 emancipated working people in the suburbs are speaking their own language, the scientific language of the working people. This language is speaking of the improvement of the people's class consciousness.

　　A new language has taken root in the revolutionary life and production labor of peasants, in the revolutionary countryside. Day by day, it will become more organized, more scientific, and more abundant.

　　Take the peasant's favorite saying: "turned over" this very simple sentence, it itself contains at least three main meanings: First, it conveys the joy and excitement in the hearts of the people who have defeated and eliminated feudal remnants. Second, it shows the people's victorious confidence in having been liberated from economic, political, and cultural bondage. Third, the peasants saw the strength of the people's democratic dictatorship, and at the same time, they also saw the victorious vision of the new countryside.

　　The creativity of the peasants is infinite, and the languages they create are incredibly beautiful, their content is unspeakably rich, and their application is unimaginably clever.

　　For example, Zhang Xingyu from Yinghai Village, at the pre-meeting convened on the night before the struggle against the local tyrants Jia Ruixin and Jia Rufen, said: "Now the landlords have had two of the three bricks under their feet removed, and the rope is already around their necks, and they can't come down even if they want to!" The positive meaning contained in his words is: the masses have risen, and the local tyrant is hanging by the neck. Now two of the bricks under his feet have been removed, and he is suspended in mid-air, unable to get the rope down!

　　Mi Shantang, a poor peasant from Shuanghe, said: "Someone asked me if it's good for us to join the Communist Party? I told him, of course it is, because even if we don't join the Communist Party, we would have been people of the People's Liberation Army long ago!"

　　When sharecropper Song Zhenqing was learning to steam buns, he sorted out his experiences and said: "If the alkali is used well, cut it with a knife and see if there are small holes like honeycombs, if there are, then the alkali is used well, this is the central link in steaming buns!" He used "central link" very accurately! It can be seen that these scientific vocabularies have been condensed together with the most subtle details of life.

　　In the emancipated countryside, emancipated men and women, households, old and young, are all speaking the people's revolutionary language. Words like "reflect," "mass line," "labor perspective," "labor force," "good labor," "engage in production," "production movement," "self-criticism," "leading role," "organized and led," "big feudalism, small feudalism," "anti-local tyrant," "struggle," "speak bitterness," "class composition," "poor peasant and hired peasant standpoint," "basic masses," "activists," "leading cadres," "revolution is war!" "Land reform is opening fire on the landlords!" These words are all used appropriately and vividly by the peasants. And they fully bring out the pure, kind, simple, positive new character and new quality of the people.

　　These scientific and revolutionary vocabularies and discourses, through flexible application, combined with the actual situation, and then combined with actual thoughts and wisdom, create a complete revolutionary language. For example, a small peasant group meeting held on that piece of ground is called a "piece meeting". Cadres from two villages often meet on agreed dates, called a "meeting of minds." If there is no objection, they say: "No opinion!" If the cadre shows some negative tendencies in action, it is called: "making trouble!" Mechanically implementing policies is called: "not strategic!" To clarify the situation, it is said to be "thorough!"

　　When the emancipated peasants use relatively abstract vocabularies, such as "active," "struggle," "specific," "improve," these words are also very appropriate, and they can just say the specific situation at that time and place.

　　In the emancipated countryside, which is undertaking the historical task of the Chinese people and struggling forward, just as a large number of activists emerge from the masses, at the same time, the most sublime, most solemn, and most harmonious unified language of mankind emerges from the masses. This is the scientific language, the true language of the New Democratic socialist Chinese people.

　　谈农民的语言
    端木蕻良
    在翻了身的新中国的农村里面，家家户户，不管是年老的，年少的农民们，都在说着一种新兴的语言，这是过去几千年来从来没有人说过的语言。这些语言是从新的生活里面生长出来的，是新民主主义中国战斗的农民们，结合了毛泽东的思想行动，为了要恰当的传出自个儿心里的意思，才找到的语言。联结着农民自己的想法，又吸收了科学的革命的词句，人民创造了一种新的智慧的语言。
    语言是传达意识形态的最完整的工具，没有它便不能传达任何斗争的意志。没有科学的组织的革命的语言，也不会传达出科学的革命的真理。在这次郊区伟大的土地革命运动里，第一批土改工作所掀动的七十七个村庄里，已经有十万九千四百零四个农民参加了这一划时代的坚强的斗争。在五十天当中，经过启发，组织，反恶霸，划阶级，调剂和分配土地、农具、食粮、房屋的革命斗争里，农民提高了阶级觉悟，认清了革命的真理。开始创造和学习新兴的语汇，传出自己高度的革命思想和战斗情绪。
    旧的日子是一去不返了。新的语言在新的日子里生长出来，和打了春的草籽一样，都爆开了芽儿来了。全郊区翻了身的十一万劳动人民都在说着自己的语言，劳动人民的科学言语。这种语言正在说出人民阶级觉悟的提高。
    一种新的语言，已经和农民革命生活和生产劳动，在革命的农村里扎根。一天比一天，会更有组织更加科学更加丰富起来。
    就拿农民顶喜欢说的：“翻了身”这句非常简单的话来说吧，它本身顶少都包含着三个主要意思：第一，是传达了打退了消灭了封建残余，人民心里的快乐和兴奋。第二，说明了人民已经从经济政治文化的捆绑里面解放出来的胜利的信心。第三，农民看见了人民民主专政的力量，同时，也看见了新的农村胜利的远景。
    农民的创造性是无限的，他们创造的语言，真是无比的美好，它们的内容，是说不出的丰满，运用是想不到的巧妙。
    比如瀛海庄的张兴玉，在斗争恶霸贾汝欣贾汝芬的头天晚上所召集的片会上说：“现在地主们脚底下三块砖，已经撤去两块了，绳子已经套在脖子上，想下来，也不行了！”他这话里包含着积极的意义是：群众已经起来了，恶霸吊颈了。现在他脚底下的砖撤去了两块，两下不着天，悬在半空里，想下绳套来也不行！
    双河的贫农米山堂说：“有人问我说咱们参加共产党，好不好？我就对他说，当然好，因为咱们不参加共产党，也早就是解放军的人了！”
    雇农宋振清在学习蒸馍的时候，整理他的经验，说：“碱使好了，用刀切一切，看看是不是有马蜂窝似的小孔，要有，就是碱使好了，这就是蒸馍的中心环节！”他用“中心环节”用得十分准确！可以看出这些科学的语汇已经和生活最细微的小节上凝结在一起。
    在翻了身的农村里，翻了身的男男女女，家家户户，老老少少，都说着人民的革命的语言。像“反映”、“群众路线”、“劳动观点”、“劳动力”、“好劳动”、“搞生产”、“生产运动”、“检讨检讨”、“带头作用”、“有组织有领导”、“大封建小封建”、“反恶霸”、“斗争”、“诉苦”、“阶级成份”、“贫雇立场”、“基本群众”、“积极分子”、“领导干部”、“革命就是打仗！”、“土地改革就是和地主们开火！”这些话农民们都用得妥贴生动。而且充分的托出纯良的朴素的积极的人民新性格新品质。
    这些科学的革命语汇和话语，经过灵活运用，结合了实际情况，再结合了实际的思想和智慧，就创造出一种完整的革命语言。比如在那一片地面上召开那一部农民的小组会，叫作“片会”。两个村庄的干部在约定的日子里常开会，叫作“碰头会”。没有异议，就说：“没意见！”干部在行动上表现了某种消极的倾向，就叫：“闹情绪！”机械的执行政策，就说：“不策略！”要把情况弄清楚，就说要“彻底彻底！”
    翻了身的农民们在运用比较抽象的语汇的时候，像“积极”、“奋斗”、“具体”、“提高”，这些词儿，也都十分恰当，而且能够刚好说出当时当地的具体情况。
    在正在担当着中国人民历史的任务，向前奋斗的翻了身的农村里，也和大批积极分子从群众里涌现出来一样，同时的，从群众里出现了人类最崇高最庄严的最和谐的统一的语言。这是科学的语言，新民主主义社会的新中国人民真正的语言。
