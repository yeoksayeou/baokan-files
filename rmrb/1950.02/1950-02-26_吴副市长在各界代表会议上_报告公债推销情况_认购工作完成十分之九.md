　　Vice Mayor Wu Reports on Public Bond Sales at Representatives Meeting: Subscription Work is Nine-Tenths Complete
    [Beijing News] The full text of Vice Mayor Wu Han's report to the Second Session of the Second Beijing Municipal People's Representatives Conference on the promotion of the People's Victory Indexed Public Bonds is as follows:
    Since the State Council of the Central People's Government issued instructions on promoting the People's Victory Indexed Public Bonds and stipulated the amount of public bonds that Beijing should undertake, we immediately established a city-wide Public Bond Promotion General Association on January 6th. Subsequently, industry and commerce, workers and staff, government agencies, teachers and staff, and others successively established branch associations. In order to promote this work more smoothly among local people and retired civil and military officials, a branch association for local people to promote public bonds was established in late January. Branches were established in various districts, and many enthusiastic local people were invited to participate in the important task of promoting public bonds.
    Due to the clear understanding of the importance and necessity of the government's issuance of public bonds by the broad masses of the people, especially workers, soldiers, teachers, staff, and government employees, and based on their high level of concern for national interests and national construction, they completed and exceeded the task of subscribing to public bonds in a very short period. It was originally planned to have a total of 400,000 shares for workers, teachers, staff, government agencies, troops, peddlers, merchants, suburban industry and commerce. As of February 14th, according to inaccurate statistics, 543,492 shares have been subscribed.
    In the industrial and commercial sector, thanks to the strong leadership and active mobilization of the Preparatory Committee of the Federation of Industry and Commerce and various trade associations, they demonstrated a spirit of patriotism and carried out relatively thorough deliberations. Based on the strength and income of each industry and household, multiple consultations were conducted. Therefore, the allocated number of public bonds was generally considered reasonable by each industry. Currently, the Industrial and Commercial Promotion Branch is coordinating with government cadres to conduct planned inspections of various industries and households, and adjustments will be made for those with excessive or insufficient allocations. As of the 23rd of this month, subscriptions have accounted for 90.04% (out of the original allocation of 1,700,000 shares, 1,530,821 shares have now been subscribed), and payments have accounted for 52.21% (887,623 shares).
    In the work of promoting public bonds among local people and retired civil and military officials, we conducted relatively frequent visits and consultations. As of the 23rd of this month, the number of subscriptions reached 466,082 shares, accounting for 66.58% of the allocated number. In the promotion of public bonds among local people, individual cadres sometimes made some mistakes in the way they mobilized individual households. After the government and the General Association discovered these in a timely manner, they were immediately corrected. We must do our best to prevent and overcome shortcomings in our work.
    In total, the above-mentioned public bond subscription figures for the city have reached 2,540,395 shares, accounting for 92.37% of the 2,750,000 shares allocated by the central government; payments have reached 1,331,889 shares, accounting for 48.43% of the allocation by the central government. We hope that the city's subscription work can be basically completed by the end of February, with payment work completed by two-thirds by the end of February, and all completed by the end of March. In order to successfully complete this arduous task, we request that all representatives continue to actively participate in leading the public bond promotion work, widely publicize it, and deeply mobilize the people to ensure that this glorious task is completed on schedule and in full.

　　吴副市长在各界代表会议上
    报告公债推销情况
    认购工作完成十分之九
    【北京讯】吴晗副市长关于北京市推行人民胜利折实公债向第二届第二次各界人民代表会议的报告，全文如下：
    自从中央人民政府政务院颁布了推行人民胜利折实公债的指示，并规定了北京市应担负的公债数目以后，我们随即于一月六日成立了全市推销公债的总会，接着工商业、职工、机关、教职员等均相继成立了分会，为了更顺利的在地方人士及退职文武官吏中间推行这一工作，于一月下旬又成立地方人士的推销公债分会，各区成立了支会，并聘请了许多热心公益的地方人士参加推销公债的重大任务。
    由于广大人民特别是职工、战士、教职员及机关工作人员对于政府发行公债的重要性与必要性有清楚的认识，基于他们高度关心国家利益与国家建设事业，所以在很短的时间内便全部并超额完成了认购公债任务，原预定职工、教职员、机关、部队及摊贩行商、郊区工商业共四十万分，截至二月十四日止，据不精确的统计，已认购五十四万三千四百九十二分。
    在工商业方面，由于工商业联合会筹委会及各同业公会的有力领导，积极动员，表现了热爱祖国的精神，进行了比较充分的酝酿，根据各行各户力量大小，收入多少，进行多次的磋商，所以分配的公债数目，大体上各行业是认为合理的。现在工商业推销分会正协同政府干部对各行业各户进行有计划的检查，对分配过多过少者则将加以调整，截至本月二十三日止，认购的已占百分之九○·○四（原分配一百七十万分，现已认购一百五十三万零八百二十一分），交纳者占百分之五二·二一（八十八万七千六百二十三分）。
    在地方人士与退职文武官吏的推销工作中，我们进行了比较多次的访问和磋商，截至本月二十三日为止，认购数达四十六万六千零八十二分，占分配数的百分之六六·五八。在地方人士的推行公债中，个别的干部对个别户在动员方式上曾经发生过一些缺点，经政府与总会及时查出后，即行纠正，我们对于工作中的缺点，要尽量防止与克服。
    总计以上本市公债认购数字已达二百五十四万零三百九十五分，占中央分配任务二百七十五万分的百分之九二·三七；交纳者达一百三十三万一千八百八十九分，占中央分配任务的百分之四八·四三。我们希望本市认购工作能于二月底基本上完成，交纳工作到二月底完成三分之二，三月底应全部完成。为着圆满完成这一艰巨的任务，我们请求各位代表对于推销公债工作继续积极参加领导，广泛宣传，深入动员，保证按期全部完成这一光荣任务。
