　　The Truth Publishes Editorial
　　On Stalin's Last Election Speech
　　This historically significant speech armed the Soviet people with a grand plan for building communism.
　　[Xinhua News Agency dispatch from Moscow by TASS] The great leader of the Bolshevik Party and the Soviet people, Joseph Stalin, delivered a historically significant speech on February 9, 1946, at the voters' meeting in the Stalin electoral district of Moscow.
　　The newspapers of February 9th this year all published special articles and editorials on this significant event.
　　The editorial in *Pravda* states: Four years have passed since the last election to the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union. Looking back on the road traveled in these four years, the Soviet people think of the great leader and teacher—Comrade Stalin. Comrade Stalin’s historically significant speech delivered on February 9, 1946, at the voters' meeting in the Stalin electoral district, armed the Soviet people with a grand plan for building communism. In his speech, Comrade Stalin explained the great, worldwide, and epoch-making significance of our people's victory over the German and Japanese aggressors and pointed out the root causes of this victory. The Soviet social system, having undergone such a severe test as war, has been proven to be fully capable of existing and is a superior form of social organization to any other social system. The Soviet Union, a multi-ethnic country, has demonstrated the powerful vitality of this system. The Soviet people built a socialist society, consolidated their multi-ethnic Soviet state, and built a first-class army. The reason they were able to do this is because they resolutely followed the path indicated by Lenin and Stalin. In his February 9th speech, Stalin explained the main task of the post-war Five-Year Plan: to repair the various regions of our country destroyed by the war, restore industry and agriculture to pre-war levels, and appropriately exceed these levels. In his speech, Comrade Stalin stipulated another historical task, namely, to catch up with and surpass scientific achievements outside the Soviet Union in the near future. Now, the entire Soviet people and the whole world see how successfully these tasks are being accomplished.
　　*Pravda* continued: The Soviet social and state system, which proved its historical significance and superiority in wartime, now more vividly confirms this superiority with its great achievements in post-war economic and cultural construction. *Pravda* emphasized: Just as the Soviet motherland was the savior who liberated mankind from the threat of fascist enslavement during the war, the Soviet motherland appears after the war as an indomitable fighter for world peace, a powerful fortress, and a standard-bearer before all peoples. United around the Soviet Union is the front of fighters striving for peace and opposing the instigators of a new imperialist war, and the strength of this powerful front is growing day by day.

    论斯大林上次选举演说           
    这一有历史意义的演说，用建设共产主义的宏大计划武装了苏联人民。
    【新华社讯】塔斯社莫斯科电：布尔什维克党和苏联人民的伟大领袖约瑟夫·斯大林于一九四六年二月九日在莫斯科市斯大林选区的选民大会上曾发表有历史意义的演说。
    今年二月九日的报纸均为这一意义重大的事件发表专文与社论。
    真理报的社论写道：自从上次选举苏联最高苏维埃以来，迄今已四年了。回顾在这四年中所走过的道路，苏联人民就想到了伟大的领袖与导师——斯大林同志。斯大林同志在一九四六年二月九日在斯大林选区选民大会上所发表的有历史意义的演说，用建设共产主义的宏大计划武装了苏联人民。斯大林同志在他的演说中说明了我国人民对德日侵略者的胜利所具有的伟大的、全世界性的、划时代的意义，并指出了这一胜利的根源。苏维埃社会制度经历了像战争那么严重的考验后，已被证明完全能够存在，并且是比任何其他社会制度都要优越的社会组织形式。苏联这一多民族的国家证明了这种制度的强大的活力。苏联人民建设了社会主义社会，巩固了他们多民族的苏维埃国家，并且建设了第一流的军队，其所以能够这样，就是因为他们坚决遵循列宁与斯大林所指示的道路。斯大林在他的二月九日的演说中，说明战后五年计划的主要任务，是要修复我国被战争破坏了的各个区域，恢复工业与农业至战前水平并适当地超过这一水平。斯大林同志在他的演说中规定了另外一个历史任务，即在最近的将来追上并超过在苏联国界以外的科学成就。现在，全体苏联人民和整个世界都看见了这些任务正在多么成功地被完成着。
    真理报继称：在战时曾证明出它具有历史意义之优越性的苏维埃社会与国家制度，现在又以其在战后经济文化建设上的伟大成就来更生动地证实了这种优越性。真理报着重指出：就象在战时苏维埃祖国是把人类自法西斯奴役的威胁中解救出来的拯救者一样，苏维埃祖国在战后以世界和平的不屈不挠的斗士，强大的堡垒与旗手的姿态出现在各族人民的面前。团结在苏联周围的是争取和平反对帝国主义新战争挑拨者的斗士阵线，这个强有力的阵线的力量正日益壮大。
