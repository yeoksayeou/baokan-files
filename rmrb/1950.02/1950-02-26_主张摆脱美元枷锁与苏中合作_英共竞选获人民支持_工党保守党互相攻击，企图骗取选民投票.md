Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 25th. The United Kingdom held its second general election since the war on the 23rd. It started at 7:00 AM British time and ended at 9:00 PM. In this election, three major parties campaigned: the Communist Party, the Labour Party, and the Conservative Party. The Liberal Party also campaigned, but its influence was small, and it partially formed an alliance with the Conservative Party. The British Communist Party's campaign goal was to resolutely defeat the reactionary Conservative Party, expose the reactionary policies of the right-wing Labour leaders, and strive for the election of Communist Party members.

All three major parties put forward election platforms last year. Except for the Communist Party's "British Road to Socialism," which pointed out the correct direction for the British people to avoid war and unemployment and create a good life, the other two platforms, "Labour Believes in Britain" and "The Right Road for Britain," were essentially the same. They both consistently advocated that Britain continue to be controlled by the United States, prepare for war, and further reduce the living standards of the working people.

The British Communist Party put forward one hundred candidates in this election and conducted independent campaign activities throughout the country. Due to the limitations of funds and many other material conditions, as well as the political discrimination of the bourgeoisie, the British Communist Party's campaign activities were greatly restricted. However, the British Communist Party still launched campaign activities in various places with the greatest strength and received the support of the broad masses of the people. The British Communist Party explained to the voters the evil consequences of the Labour Party and Conservative Party's policies and pointed out the correct path to liberation for the British people. This is: to end the United States' increasingly tight control over Britain, get rid of the dollar shackles, and establish and develop friendly cooperation and extensive trade relations with the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and other people's democratic countries; to stop war movements and colonial military activities, use manpower and financial resources for domestic production and construction and to improve people's lives, and contribute to the cause of world peace; to stop economic crises, adopt genuinely socialist policies, end panic, and build an independent, free, prosperous, and strong socialist Britain for the working class.

During the election, the Labour Party and the Conservative Party attacked each other, attempting to deceive voters into voting for them. But the platforms of the Labour Party and the Conservative Party were almost exactly the same in content. The London Times also openly admitted that "this party platform can be put paragraph by paragraph into the platform of the other party." They all advocate: continuing to rely on American imperialism; continuing to implement the "Western European Union," the "Marshall Plan," the "Atlantic Pact," the "Cold War," and wage freezes. They only have some differences in the methods of some basic policies to protect capital. For example, the Conservative Party advocates so-called "free enterprise," while the Labour Party promotes so-called "mixed economy." In the last few days of the campaign, anti-Soviet warmonger Churchill suddenly swore in a speech in Edinburgh that if the Conservative Party came to power, he would do everything possible to have a "top-level meeting" with the Soviet Union to "eliminate the gap between East and West." Obviously, Churchill wanted to take advantage of the British people's desire for peace to speculate. Even so, Churchill still revealed his warmongering nature. For example, he was still touting the so-called advantage of American atomic bombs, saying that this was the most reliable guarantee of world "peace." The Labour leaders, who have been pursuing an anti-Soviet policy for several years, were at a loss in the face of this electoral propaganda offensive by the Conservative Party. Obviously, whether the Labour Party or the Conservative Party is elected, the British people will never be able to obtain true peace from them.

### 主张摆脱美元枷锁与苏中合作  英共竞选获人民支持  工党保守党互相攻击，企图骗取选民投票

　　主张摆脱美元枷锁与苏中合作
    英共竞选获人民支持
    工党保守党互相攻击，企图骗取选民投票
    【新华社北京廿五日电】英国于二十三日举行了战后第二次大眩选举于英国时间上午七时开始，到下午九时结束。在这次大选中，进行竞选的有三个主要的政党：共产党、工党和保守党。自由党虽亦竞选，但影响不大，而且部分地与保守党结成同盟。英共竞选的目标是要坚决击败反动的保守党，暴露右翼工党领袖的反动政策，争取共产党员当选。
    三个主要的党在去年都提出了竞选纲领。除了共产党的“英国社会主义的道路”给英国人民指出了避免战争和失业以及创造良好生活的正确方向外，其他两个纲领“工党相信英国”和“英国的正路”基本上是相同的，它们都一致主张英国继续受美国控制，准备战争以及进一步降低劳动人民的生活。
    英国共产党在这次大选中提出了一百名候选人，并在全国各地进行独立的竞选运动。由于经费及其他许多物质条件的限制和资产阶级的政治歧视，使英共的竞选活动受到极大限制，但是，英共仍以最大力量在各地展开竞选活动，并受到广大人民的支持。英共向选民解释了工党与保守党的政策的恶果，并指出了英国人民正确的解放道路。这就是：结束美国对英国一步步加紧的控制，摆脱美元枷锁，而与苏联、中华人民共和国及其他人民民主国家建立和发展友好合作及广泛贸易的关系；停止战争运动和殖民军事活动，把人力及财力用于国内生产建设和改善人民的生活，同时贡献于世界的和平事业；制止经济危机，采取真正社会主义的政策，结束恐慌，建立工人阶级的独立自由和富强的社会主义的英国。
    工党与保守党在竞选中间，曾互相攻讦，企图借以骗取选民的投票。但工党和保守党的纲领，内容上差不多是完全一样的。伦敦泰晤士报也公开承认，“这一党纲领可以整段整段地放进另一党的纲领里去”。它们都主张：继续投靠美帝国主义；继续执行“西欧联盟”、“马歇尔计划”、“大西洋公约”、“冷战”和冻结工资。它们只在对于保护资本的基本政策的一些方法上有些出入，例如保守党鼓吹所谓“自由企业”而工党则宣传所谓“混合经济”。在竞选运动的最后几天，反苏战贩邱吉尔突然在爱丁堡的演说中发誓，说如果保守党上了台，他将尽一切努力与苏联“最高方面会谈”，以“消弭东西两方之间的鸿沟”。显然，邱吉尔是想利用英国人民渴望和平的情绪，来进行投机。虽然如此，邱吉尔还是露出了他的战贩的马脚，例如，他还在吹擂着所谓美国原子弹的优势，说什么这是世界“和平”最可靠的保证。几年来一直采取反苏政策的工党首脑们在保守党这个选举宣传的攻势下莫知所措。显然，不管工党或保守党当选，英国人民绝不能从他们那里取得真正的和平。
