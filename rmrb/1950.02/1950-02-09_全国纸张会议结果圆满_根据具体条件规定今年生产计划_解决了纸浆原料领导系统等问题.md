Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, February 8th. The first National Paper Conference convened by the Ministry of Light Industry of the Central People's Government concluded successfully on January 19th, after fifteen days. The conference studied the production capacity and conditions of the national paper industry, and stipulated that the guiding principle for the paper industry in the future should be comprehensive recovery and focused development. Based on the existing foundation, and considering the current paper needs, raw material supply situation, and possibilities for increased production, the conference determined the 1950 production plan for national public and private paper mills.

Regarding the problem of insufficient pulp raw materials, the conference believed that this is currently the main obstacle to the recovery and development of the paper industry. However, large-scale construction of pulp mills in 1950 is not yet possible. Therefore, the conference decided to adopt the method of focused investment and reorganization and expansion of existing pulp mills. The plan for this year is to first expand the Yibin Wood Pulp Mill in Sichuan, prepare for the establishment of a joint public-private Huadong Grass Pulp Mill, and at the same time restore and develop the wood pulp mills in the Northeast.

Regarding the supply of machinery, materials, and supplies necessary for papermaking, such as felts and copper wire cloth, the conference believed that self-sufficiency must be gradually achieved to save foreign exchange expenditures. The conference decided to request the Ministry of Textile Industry to instruct the Zhongfang Company Woolen Mill to study and manufacture various papermaking felts, in order to improve the quality and output of domestic felts, and to propose to the government to establish a new copper wire cloth factory based on the current copper wire cloth factory in the Northeast, in order to solve the national paper machine copper wire cloth needs.

This conference established a special group to discuss issues such as the leadership system, organizational structure, and enterprise management of state-owned paper mills. The conference decided to establish a Paper Industry Department under the Central Ministry of Light Industry to centrally guide and promote the development of the paper industry. Each region may establish paper companies to uniformly lead the public paper industry in their respective regions. The leadership system of each paper company, except for the North China Paper Company which is directly led by the Central Ministry of Light Industry, will continue to be unified by the industrial departments of the major administrative regions.

Regarding the operation of state-owned paper mills, the conference believed that enterprise management and economic accounting systems must be implemented. Currently, state-owned paper mills in various regions, except for the Northeast, which has gradually achieved regularized planned production, are still in the stages of reorganization and recovery. The most important task for these regions is to clear assets and restore production, and then gradually implement economic accounting systems and embark on the road of enterprise-based planning.

Regarding the guidance of the hand-made paper industry, the conference believed that in the short term, domestic machine-made paper cannot fully supply the national needs. Therefore, local governments should immediately provide guidance to the hand-made paper industry, and organize them through production and sales cooperatives, production loans, and other methods; and provide assistance in technology, so that the hand-made paper industry gradually moves towards mechanization.

In addition, the conference also discussed issues such as the training and deployment of technical personnel, and the transformation and development direction of the private paper industry.

　　全国纸张会议结果圆满
    根据具体条件规定今年生产计划
    解决了纸浆原料领导系统等问题
    【新华社北京八日电】中央人民政府轻工业部召开的首届全国纸张会议历时十五天，已于一月十九日圆满闭幕。会议研究了全国造纸工业的生产能力和生产条件，规定今后造纸工业以全面恢复和重点发展为方针；并在现有基础上就目前纸张需要、原料供应情况和增产的可能性，确定了一九五○年全国公私营造纸厂的生产计划。
    关于纸浆原料不足的问题，会议认为这是目前造纸工业恢复和发展的主要阻碍。但一九五○年要大规模建设纸浆厂尚不可能，因此会议决定采用重点投资和整理扩充原有浆厂的办法，计划今年先扩充四川宜宾木浆厂，筹设公私合营的华东草浆厂，同时恢复和发展东北的木浆厂。
    关于造纸所必需的毛毯、铜丝布等机料物料的供给问题，会议认为必须逐渐自给，以节省外汇支出。会议决定请纺织工业部责成中纺公司毛织厂研究制造各种造纸用毛毯，以提高国产毛毯质量与产量，并向政府提议以东北目前的铜丝布厂为基础建立一个新铜丝布厂，以解决全国造纸机上铜丝布的需要。
    这次会议对公营纸厂的领导系统、组织机构和经营企业化等问题曾设专门小组加以讨论。会议决定在中央轻工业部下设造纸工业处，以集中指导和推进造纸工业的发展。各地区得设立造纸公司，统一领导各该地区的公营造纸事业。各造纸公司的领导系统除华北造纸公司由中央轻工业部直接领导外，其他地区仍由各大行政区工业部门来统一领导。
    关于公营纸厂的经营，会议认为必须实现企业化和经济核算制。目前各地区公营纸厂，除东北已逐渐做到正规化的计划生产外，其他地区还在整理和恢复阶段，此等地区目前最重要的任务是清理资产、恢复生产，然后逐步实施经济核算制，走上企业化计划化的道路。
    关于对手工造纸业的辅导问题，会议认为在短期内国内机制纸张尚不能充分供应全国的需要，所以各地政府对于手工造纸业应即加以辅导，通过产销合作社、生产贷款等方式把他们组织起来；并在技术方面予以协助，使手工造纸业逐渐走向机械化的道路。
    此外，会议对技术人员的培养与调配、私营造纸业的改造与发展方向等问题亦曾进行了讨论。
