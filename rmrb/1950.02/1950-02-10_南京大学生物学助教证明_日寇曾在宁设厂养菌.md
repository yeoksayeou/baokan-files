　　Nanjing University Biology Teaching Assistant Proves
    Japanese Invaders Set Up Factories in Nanjing to Culture Bacteria
    [Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, February 9th] People here have confirmed that the Japanese invaders also had a large factory in Nanjing for manufacturing bacteriological weapons. The factory was originally located inside Nanjing city, at the foot of Jiuhua Mountain in the northern corner. To disguise it, it was called the "Serum Vaccine Manufacturing Plant," and it was usually kept very secret. The Japanese invaders destroyed it upon surrender. According to local residents, during the time of the Japanese, the inside was full of small houses covered with white iron sheets, and no Chinese person was ever allowed to enter. No one knew what they were doing inside, only that they were making medicine. Zhu Hongwen, the current teaching assistant in the Biology Department of Nanjing University, who assisted the Kuomintang government in taking over the place in November 1945, said: During the takeover, there was still a remnant of a high-pressure sterilizer as big as a room, next to which was installed a large boiler to supply steam. There were rails inside. All materials for culturing bacteria were first carried in by carts for sterilization, which shows the scale of its manufacture. Zhu Hongwen said: At that time, a lot of residual things were also received. In terms of experimental animals, there were more than 2,000 white mice and hundreds of guinea pigs, but they all died soon after. In terms of instruments for culturing bacteria, there were hundreds of thousands of test tubes and petri dishes, dozens of incubators and refrigerators, and hundreds of aluminum culture boxes. In terms of culture media, there were more than 30 tons of agar and more than 100 boxes of fish and meat extract. According to a rough estimate, every two to three cubic centimeters of agar can produce 20 to 30 cc of bacterial suspension, then just the remaining batch of culture media left by the Japanese invaders was enough to manufacture 300 million cc of inhumane bacteriological weapons.
    At the same time, the Nanjing "Rong Unit" mentioned by war criminal Sato in the military tribunal of the Primorsky Krai Military District of the Soviet Union has now also been confirmed to have been stationed at Zhongshan North Road in Nanjing at that time, which later became the location of the Kuomintang's Joint Logistics Headquarters. In 1943, when Zhu Hongwen was a technician at the Japanese invaders' Central China Epidemic Prevention Office, he entered it once. According to Zhu Hongwen, the Japanese invaders internally called the department the "Science Unit." The officers and soldiers were all bacteriology experts and college students, but for the sake of concealment, they did not have any special signs, except that they did not have guns, they were all the same as ordinary Japanese soldiers.

　　南京大学生物学助教证明
    日寇曾在宁设厂养菌
    【新华社南京九日电】此间人士已证实：日寇在南京也曾有一个大工厂，制造细菌武器。该厂原设南京城内北角九华山下，为了伪装隐蔽，称为“血清疫苗制造所”，平时极为机密。日寇于投降时即加以破坏。据当地居民说：日本人在时，里面都是木板盖的白铁围的小房子，从来不准一个中国人进去。谁也不知里面做什么，只当是制药的。据在一九四五年十一月协助国民党政府接收该处的现任南京大学生物学系助教朱洪文说：在接收时，那里还有一座像一间房子一样大的高压消毒器残体，其旁装置一座大锅炉，用以供给蒸气。里面有铁轨。一切培养细菌的材料先用车子载进去消毒，可见其制造规模的庞大。朱洪文说：当时还接收了不少残余的东西。在试验动物方面有两千多只小白鼠和几百只天竺鼠，但不久就全部死掉了。在培养细菌用的仪器方面有试管、平板各数十万只，温箱（孵卵箱）、冰箱各数十个，铝质培养箱数百个。在培养基方面有东洋菜（?脂）三十余吨，鱼肉精膏百余箱。据大略推算，每二至三公分?脂可制造细菌悬液二十至三十西西，则仅就日寇所余的这一批培养基，就足以制造绝灭人性的细菌武器三万万西西。
    同时，战犯佐藤在苏联滨海军区军事法庭上供称的南京“荣部队”，现亦已证实其当时驻地就是南京中山北路，即后来国民党的联勤总部所在地。一九四三年朱洪文在日寇的华中防疫处任技士时，曾进去过一次。据朱洪文说，日寇内部称该部为“科学部队”。官兵都是细菌学专家和大学生，但他们为了隐蔽起见，并无若何特别标志，除了没有枪而外，全和普通日本兵一样。
