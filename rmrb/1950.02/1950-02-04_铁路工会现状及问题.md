　　Current Situation and Problems of Railway Trade Unions
    By Our Reporter Chen Ji
    Railway Workers Across the Country Are Basically Organized
    All railways on mainland China have been nationalized, and more than 400,000 railway workers have been liberated. Since the Preparatory Committee of the All-China Railway Federation of Trade Unions was established last July, 78.1 percent of the nation's railway workers—320,628 people—have become members of the All-China Railway Federation of Trade Unions.
    In the initial stage of developing trade unions in various regions, active elements were relied upon first to initially mobilize the masses of workers and establish trade union preparatory committees. After a certain period of preparation, the trade unions were then established. For example, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, railway workers in the Shanghai area bravely fought against the enemy before liberation, protecting factories and railways, and assisted the People's Government in taking over and inventorying, and repairing lines after liberation. A large number of activists emerged in the work, and on this basis, the trade union preparatory committee was established. By mid-November, trade union membership had grown to 65.5 percent of the employees, and the trade union was officially established. Another example is the railway workers in the Beijing area. Before liberation, they had organized employee associations and welcome committees for the People's Liberation Army entering the city. After the liberation of Beijing, they held employee forums, short-term training classes, and used large classes to publicize the Party's policies, gradually established trade union preparatory committees, carried out preparatory work, and then elected representatives to establish trade unions.
    Overcoming Closed-Doorism
    In the early stage of developing membership, railway trade unions in various regions experienced a tendency towards closed-doorism. For example, some trade union units in the Zhengzhou area set excessively high conditions in the initial stage of developing membership, which excluded most workers from the trade union. When the Hankou Engineering Section Trade Union of the Zhengzhou area called on workers to join the trade union, they found that the number of workers applying to join the union increased. Fearing that saboteurs would infiltrate the trade union, they immediately announced conditions such as "clean history, upright work style, progressive thinking, and active work," and stipulated that anyone who joined the union had to write a "self-examination," otherwise they would not be allowed to join. After ten days of development, not a single worker joined the trade union. The Zhangzhenzhuang Trade Union in the Tianjin area adopted secret methods to develop members and told members not to expose their membership. As a result, only twenty-six members were developed in a month. Some places believed that "they are busy with rating movements and meritorious service movements all day long and have no time to develop members," but they forgot that the movements were a great opportunity to develop members. Why didn't they organize workers to establish trade unions in these movements? Their own self-criticism was correct: "The main reason is that they do not understand that the trade union is a mass organization of the working class and do not understand the basic principle of organizing the entire working class." This tendency has been basically overcome in various places after the timely instructions of the National Trade Union Work Conference and the Preparatory Committee of the All-China Railway Federation of Trade Unions last year. In June last year, trade union membership in the Guannei railways only accounted for 34.6 percent of all employees. By the end of last year, the number of members had increased to 83.2 percent of all employees.
    Opposing Closed-Doorism Is a Constant Struggle
    Opposing closed-doorism is a constant struggle. After the Northeast Railway Federation of Trade Unions opposed closed-doorism through the February meeting, the "May 1st" Congress, and the October meeting last year, the chairman of the Nancha Station Trade Union said: "There is no closed-doorism here!" However, according to the investigation of the Northeast Railway Federation of Trade Unions, 10 percent of the employees at Nancha Station were actually unable to join the union due to conditions such as "inactive work." The individual areas of the Jinzhou Branch Federation of Trade Unions reviewed trade union members no differently from reviewing Party members and Communist Youth League members. The Zhengzhou Railway Trade Union has not paid enough attention to this aspect. To this day, trade union membership in the area has only developed to 61.4 percent of all employees. The Jilin Railway Trade Union in Northeast China can pay attention to this issue in a timely manner, often holding meetings of primary trade union directors to check the tendency of closed-doorism. Therefore, the total number of members of the Jilin Railway Trade Union increased from 77.9 percent of employees in June last year to 95.3 percent by the end of last year.
    Prevent Formalism in a Timely Manner
    While opposing closed-doorism, formalism should also be prevented. When the Xinyang Railway Trade Union in the Zhengzhou area heard that closed-doorism was to be opposed, they issued membership forms according to the number of people in the production unit, without introduction, discussion, or approval, and made rosters and issued membership cards in a muddle-headed manner. Eight hundred members were developed in six days. Workers said: "This is really forced conscription. There is no difference between joining the union and not joining the union." Zhangjiakou Station once called on everyone to join the union, and anyone who did not join the union would be "criticized," so the workers had to join the union.
　　  Orienting Towards Production and Opposing Pure Welfare Views
    The Jinan Railway Trade Union made great efforts to open cooperatives last year, purchasing materials and selling them to workers at low prices, which was of course correct. However, they only paid attention to this kind of work, while neglecting to organize workers to improve production. The average price of rice sold to workers by the cooperative in May last year was 1,000 yuan cheaper than the market price. In June, their cooperative had to increase the price of rice due to price fluctuations, and it was only 600 yuan cheaper than the market price per catty. The workers said: "Why did the price of rice go up this month?" The workers only saw that their work was in running cooperatives, but did not understand that the trade union was to ensure the improvement of production. Some trade unions verbally admitted the importance of production, but actually thought that "trade union groups cannot discuss production." Or they shouted "guarantee production" every day, but in reality, they did not lead the masses to formulate production plans and seriously arrange production work.
    What should trade unions do in production work? Regarding this issue, the Northeast Railway Trade Union, after a long period of exploration, believes that the following points should be achieved: (1) Actively learn production knowledge, often study methods to complete administrative production plans, and mobilize the masses to provide rationalization proposals for production; (2) Organize mass production competitions; (3) Organize mass production supervision, and pay attention to overcoming phenomena such as employees violating labor discipline, wasting working hours, and wasting state property; (4) Widely exchange production experience.
    How do many trade unions organize and lead production work? This is still a serious problem. For example, some trade union cadres enthusiastically launched large-scale production movements, but after the movement was launched, they did not know how to specifically organize and lead the production movement. Therefore, the workers said: "We have many movements, but little harvest." This kind of situation also happened in other regions. According to the self-criticism of the comrades of the railway trade unions in various regions, the main reason for this situation is that the trade union cadres do not understand production knowledge and business technology, so they cannot be good at organizing production work. This problem needs to be brought to the attention of comrades who are engaged in trade union work.

　　铁路工会现状及问题
    本报记者陈迹
    全国铁路工人基本上已组织起来了
    中国大陆上的铁路已全部归人民所有，四十多万铁路员工获得解放。从去年七月中华全国铁路总工会筹备委员会成立至今，占全国铁路员工百分之七十八·一——三十二万零六百二十八人成为中华全国铁路总工会会员。
    各地区发展工会的初期，都首先依靠积极分子，初步发动工人群众，成立工会筹备会；筹备至一定时期，即成立工会。例如上海区铁路工人在中国共产党领导下，解放前对敌人英勇斗争，护厂护路，解放后协助人民政府接管清点，抢修线路，在工作中涌现出大批积极分子，在这个基础上即成立起工会筹备会。十一月中旬，工会会员发展至员工百分之六十五点五，遂正式成立工会。又如北京区铁路职工，在解放前，曾组织职工联谊会、欢迎解放军入城委员会；北京解放后，曾召开职工座谈会、短期训练班，并用上大课等方式，宣传党的政策，逐步成立工会筹备会，进行筹备工作，然后再选举代表成立工会。
    克服了关门主义
    各地铁路工会在发展会员的初期，曾发生过关门主义的偏向。例如郑州区有的工会单位，在发展会员的初期，曾订出过高的条件，使得大多数工人被摈弃于工会大门之外。郑州区汉口工务段工会在号召工人加入工会时，发现申请入会的工人增多，害怕有捣乱分子混入工会，随即又宣布“历史清白，作风正派，思想进步，工作积极”等条件，并规定谁入会得写“反省书”，不然不准入会。发展了十天，结果没有一个工人参加工会。天津区张真庄工会采取秘密方式发展会员，并告诉会员不要暴露会员的面目。这样，一个月才发展了二十六个会员。有些地方认为“成天忙于评资运动、立功运动，没有时间发展会员”，但是却忘记了在运动中正是发展会员的很好机会。为什么他们不在这些运动中组织工人成立工会呢？他们自己检讨得对：“主要是不了解工会是工人阶级的群众组织，不懂得组织全体工人阶级的基本道理。”这种偏向，经过去年全国工会工作会议和中华全国铁路总工会筹备委员会的及时指示，各地已在基本上克服了。去年六月份关内铁路工会会员只占全体员工百分之三十四点六，到了去年年底会员人数增至全体员工百分之八十三点二。
    反对关门主义是一个经常的斗争
    反对关门主义是一个经常的斗争。去年东北铁路总工会经过二月会议、“五、一”大会和十月会议反对关门主义后，南叉站工会主席说：“我们这里可没有关门主义了！”但经东北铁路总工会的调查，南叉站实际上还有百分之十的员工因“工作不积极”等等条件而未能入会。锦州分总会的个别地区审查工会会员竟与审查党员、团员没有区别。郑州区铁路工会在这方面注意不够，至今该区工会会员才发展到全体员工的百分之六十一点四。东北吉林区铁路工会能及时注意这个问题，经常召开基层工会主任会议，检查关门主义偏向，因此吉林区铁路工会从去年六月间会员总数只占员工百分之七十七点九，到去年年底增至百分之九十五点三。
    及时防止形式主义
    在反对关门主义的同时，还应该防止形式主义的发生。郑州区信阳铁路工会听说要反对关门主义，他们就按生产单位人数发出会员表，不经过介绍、讨论和批准，糊糊涂涂地造名册，发会员证，六天当中发展了八百个会员。工人说：“这真是拉伕，我们入会与不入会没什么区别。”张家口车站曾经号召大家都要加入工会，谁要不加入工会，谁要受到“批评”，这样工人们就只好都加入工会。
　　  面向生产与反对单纯福利观点
    济南区铁路工会在去年曾以大力开办合作社，购买物资，廉价卖给工人，这当然是对的。但是他们却仅仅注意这类工作，而忽视了组织工人提高生产。合作社在去年五月卖给工人的米价平均都比市价便宜一千元，到了六月他们的合作社因物价波动，米价不得不提高，每斤比市价只便宜六百元。工人们便说：“这个月的米价，为什么涨高哪？”工人们只看见他们的工作是在办合作社，而不懂得工会是要保证提高生产，有些工会口头承认生产的重要，实际上却以为“工会小组不能讨论生产”。或者是每天高喊“保证生产”，而实际上并没领导群众订出生产计划，认真布置生产工作。
    工会在生产工作上应该作些什么呢？关于这一问题，东北铁路工会经过一个长期的摸索过程后，认为应该做到下列几点：（一）积极学习生产知识，经常研究完成行政生产计划的办法，动员群众提供生产合理化建议；（二）组织群众性生产竞赛；（三）组织群众性的生产监督，注意克服员工违反劳动纪律、浪费工时和浪费国家财产等类现象；（四）广泛交流生产经验。
    许多工会如何去组织和领导生产工作呢？在目前也还是严重地存在着的一个问题。例如有些工会干部曾热情地发动了大规模的生产运动，但运动开展后，不知道怎样具体地组织和领导这个生产运动，因此工人就说：“我们的运动多，收获少。”这类情形，也同样地发生在其他的地区。根据各地区铁路工会同志自己的检讨，认为产生这种情形的主要原因是在于工会干部不了解生产知识，不懂得业务技术，所以也就不能善于组织生产工作。这个问题，需要提起作工会工作的同志们注意。
