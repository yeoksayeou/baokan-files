　　Deeply Understand Situations in Each Household, Patiently Mobilize
    Help Disaster Victims Find Ways to Produce
    Xu Anran Elected Model for Disaster Relief in Liandong
    [Report from this newspaper] At the enlarged meeting of the Production and Disaster Relief Committee of Liandong County, Northern Jiangsu Province, on January 15 this year, Xu Anran was elected as the county's "Model for Production and Disaster Relief." Xu Anran is the chairman of the trade union of Danan Township (50 years old this year, poor peasant background). Last December, he went to Fengluo Village to lead production and disaster relief. Among the 230 households in the village, 124 were disaster victims. He first went deep into the disaster-stricken households to understand the situation; then, based on the different conditions of each household, he mobilized them to find various production methods and draw up production plans. For example, Wang Bitai had chili peppers, so he mobilized him to grind chili sauce for sale. Feng Zhaoli knew how to use a homemade gun, so he mobilized him to borrow a homemade gun to hunt rabbits. Grandma Feng could not do other labor, so he helped her make hemp thread. Xu Anran was not only able to go deep into each household to lead everyone to find solutions, but also able to start from one household, gain experience, and promote it in a timely manner. In mobilizing Jiang Yaoshi to make tofu, he dispelled her worries about losing face and owing debts. Later, he used this experience to mobilize other women to produce. He was also able to flexibly grasp the changes in the situation and lead the disaster victims to quickly change production methods. When it rained and he could not sweep niter, he mobilized the disaster victims to weave mats or do small business on the river. Xu Anran led the disaster victims to produce, not afraid of hardship, not afraid of difficulties, patiently thinking of ways, and being responsible to the disaster victims. Under his leadership, 119 disaster-stricken households in Fengluo Village found ways to produce in one month.
    The Liandong County Committee of the Communist Party of China has specifically decided to launch a movement to learn from Xu Anran throughout the county in order to overcome the negative, pessimistic, and empty-talking phenomena of party member cadres in the work of production and disaster relief.

　　深入各户了解情况耐心发动
    帮助灾民想法生产     
    徐安然当选涟东救灾模范
    【本报讯】今年一月十五日在苏北涟东县生产救灾委员会扩大会议上，徐安然被选为全县“生产救灾模范”。徐安然是大南乡工会主任（今年五十岁，贫农成份），去年十二月份，到冯罗村领导生产救灾。该村二百三十户中有一百二十四户灾民。他首先深入灾民，了解情况；随即根据各户不同条件，发动他们找出各种生产办法，订出生产计划。如王必太有辣椒，就发动他磨辣椒酱卖。冯兆立会使土枪，发动他借土枪打兔子。冯大奶奶不能做其他劳动，就帮助她打麻线。徐安然不仅能深入各户领导大家想办法，而且能从一户做起，做出经验，及时推广。他在发动姜姚氏做豆腐中，解除了她怕丢人、怕欠账的顾虑。以后就用这个经验发动其他妇女生产。他并能灵活掌握情况变化，领导灾民迅速转变生产门路。下雨时不能扫硝，便发动灾民编折席，或到河上做小买卖。徐安然领导灾民生产，不怕吃苦，不怕困难，耐心想办法，对灾民负责。冯罗村在他领导下，一个月中一百一十九户灾民找到了生产门路。
    中共涟东县委特决定全县开展学习徐安然运动，以克服党员干部在生产救灾工作中消极悲观、空喊空跑等现象。
