Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, February 17th: Telecommunications Agency, New York, February 16th: All American newspapers published the thirty-year alliance treaty between the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China on their front pages. Many newspapers, such as the New York Times, published the full text of the treaty announcement and the full text of the treaty, in addition to reporters' reports. The announcement of this treaty, which unites 700 million people in the cause of peaceful socialism, and the parts of the agreement concerning the return of the Chinese Changchun Railway, Lushunkou, and Dalian, have deeply embarrassed Washington, because it is exactly the opposite of what the US State Department wanted to induce the American public to believe. This part of the treaty, which shows that the Soviet Union's negotiations with China were based entirely on an equal footing, has created a huge impression here. The same attention is paid here to the clause in the agreement stipulating that if either contracting party is attacked by Japan or a country allied with Japan, the two parties will immediately provide mutual assistance.

Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, February 17th: Telecommunications Agency, London, February 16th: The attitude of resistance shown by the capitalist newspapers here towards the Sino-Soviet treaty eloquently illustrates the blow the treaty has dealt to British and American imperialism. The Labour Party's Daily Herald and the Conservative Party's Daily Express have not even made any comments on the treaty. It is conceivable that this news is "too big" for the heads of the reactionary press, and they cannot come up with convincing lies to comment on this event. The treaty itself means that the efforts of the British imperialists at the Colombo Conference and the American imperialists at the Bangkok Conference have been wasted. This is the unprecedented and greatest blow to colonial aggression in the Far East.

　　中苏同盟粉碎造谣
    美帝狼狈不堪
    英反动报纸对此哑口无言
    【新华社北京十七日电】电通社纽约十六日讯：所有美国报纸均以首页刊载苏联和中华人民共和国间的三十年同盟条约。许多报纸，例如纽约时报，除了记者报道之外，均刊载了该约公告的全文以及条约的全文。使七亿人民联合起来从事于和平的社会主义事业的这一条约的宣布，以及协定中有关归还中国长春铁路、旅顺口和大连的部分，都使华盛顿深为狼狈，因为它是与美国国务院想诱使美国公众相信的东西恰好相反的。条约的这一部分表现了苏联与中国谈判完全基于平等的立场，业已在此间造成巨大的印象。此间对协定中规定一旦缔约国任何一方受到日本或与日本结盟国家之侵袭时，双方即实行互助一节，予以同样的注意。
    【新华社北京十七日电】电通社伦敦十六日讯：此间资本家报纸对中苏条约所表现的抵制态度，其本身就雄辩地说明该约对英美帝国主义的打击。工党的每日先驱报及保守党的每日快报，对于该约甚至没有发表任何言论。可以设想，这一消息对于反动报界的首脑们是“太大了”，他们不能想出足以使人信服的谎话来评论这一事件。条约本身就意味着英帝国主义者在科伦坡会议上及美帝国主义者在曼谷会议上的努力白费了。这是对在远东的殖民地侵略的空前最大的打击。
