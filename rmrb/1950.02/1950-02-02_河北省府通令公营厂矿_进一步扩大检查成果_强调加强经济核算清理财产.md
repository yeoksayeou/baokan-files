The Hebei Provincial Government Issues Circular to Publicly Owned Factories and Mines
	Further Expand Inspection Results
	Emphasize Strengthening Economic Accounting and Inventorying Assets

[This newspaper's report] To earnestly implement the spirit of the Central Finance and Economics Committee's call for a comprehensive inspection of industry and mining, to maximize production efficiency and restore and develop production, the Provincial Government has issued a circular to all special districts, cities, and provincial-level factories and mines to continue in-depth inspections. In mid-February, the Industry Department convened a meeting of accounting personnel from provincial-level factories and mines, emphasizing that the focus for 1950 will be on strengthening economic accounting, calculating costs, and inventorying assets. At the same time, to further expand the results of the inspection, the province plans to organize several inspection teams in stages to go to various special districts, cities, and counties to inspect city-run, private, and institutionally operated factories and mines. On February 26th, the Provincial Mining Bureau dispatched nine cadres to various locations to work with local governments to first inspect the Kangercheng, Guoerzhuang, and Hecun mining areas in Wu'an before the Spring Festival. The inspection will focus on issues such as the safety equipment, worker hygiene, and whether the installation and allocation of machinery in each private coal mine is reasonable. After the Spring Festival, inspections will be carried out on small coal mines in Fangshan District, Lingshan District, and other areas. (Zhang Junfeng)
