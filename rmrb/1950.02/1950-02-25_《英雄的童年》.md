　　《A Hero's Childhood》
    Shidai Publishing House, written by Bo Fancai, translated by Fei Ran, and reviewed by Yu Mingren
    Bo Fancai's "A Hero's Childhood" is a novella that won the Stalin Prize. It describes how an ordinary Soviet youth was educated by the new society in his childhood and became a hero.
    In the book, Doctor Ustin Anisimovich earnestly teaches the younger generation: "To whom can we entrust the young Soviet country that we have struggled and worked so hard to achieve? Do you understand, Suchi?" This reminds us of the lessons that many elders in old China gave their children: "Child, study hard! When you succeed in the future, bring glory to the family and let your parents enjoy a good life." This shows that in different societies, people's expectations for their children are completely different.
    Suchi Lagunov is a naughty child, and his childish heart is stained with the bad habits of the old society. But his father, Ivan Lagunov, is a glorious Communist Party member who participated in the anti-imperialist war and won the Red Banner Medal. In 1929, when the collective farm began to be established, he used vivid reality to educate the peasants and organized the scattered small farmers to embark on the road of collectivism. He is a model parent, knowing how to manage the family, educate the children, and cultivate a new generation for the Soviet state. He uses heavy words to educate his son:
    "People like you, if we don't fight in armored vehicles and infantry to change our destiny, then you are probably destined to live a desperate and impoverished life as a farmer...
    "Why was your childhood hard labor cancelled? That is because we already have Soviet power, and this power does not need fools, illiterates, and idiots. Now we only ask you one thing -- the main thing -- is to study..." Moreover, he does not use the authority of a father to reprimand his children, but uses his own loyalty to the Party, the Soviet state, and the working people, as well as his achievements, to educate his children and refine them into useful people. He believes in Lenin and Stalin and strives for the communist ideology throughout his life. In this way, he naturally instilled good education in his children, making them unconsciously think: What can I do to help in my father's new cause? I feel that Uncle Lenin and Stalin, who overthrew the tyrant and defeated various enemies, are carefully watching my actions from above!...
    Childhood education affects the future life. Suchi Lagunov finally joined the Leninist Youth League. An excellent Soviet hero was thus trained.
    The old Chinese society regarded children as the private property of the family, and parents completely educated their children with the desire to benefit their own family, burying the roots of selfishness and self-interest. Today, the ancient country has turned over, and everyone who has come from the old society should earnestly examine themselves from beginning to end, correct the past erroneous ideas and attitudes in educating children; educate children with their own actions, and closely integrate with the interests of the new democratic country. Here, Ivan Lagunov is the best example.
    "A Hero's Childhood" further inspires each of our young people, reminding us: Today, when the heroic People's Liberation Army led by the Chinese Communist Party has overcome all difficulties and created a new democratic country, bringing the younger generation into a new living environment, how should we strengthen and transform ourselves to serve the young motherland! We should do what Suchi Lagunov said when he joined the Leninist Youth League: "Study and study again, learn all kinds of sciences, learn them well if possible, and contribute your life and knowledge to your country when necessary."

### 《英雄的童年》

　　《英雄的童年》
    时代书局出版  勃凡采夫著  斐然译  俞明仁
    勃凡采夫著的《英雄的童年》，是一部获得斯大林奖金的中篇小说。它描写一个平凡的苏联青年在童年时代，是如何地被新社会教育而成为英雄。
    书中，医生乌斯丁·安息莫维枢这样恳切地教训着后辈：“我们所斗争所辛苦得来的年青的苏维埃国家，将来可以交托给谁呢？你懂得吗，苏奇？”这使我们想起旧中国有许多长辈们给孩子们的教训：“孩子，好好用功读书吧！将来出山了，为家门争光，好带你爹妈享享福。”这说明了在不同的社会中，人们对孩子寄予的希望也完全不同。
    苏奇·拉古诺夫是个顽皮的孩子，童稚的心里沾染了旧社会的恶习。但他的父亲伊凡·拉古诺夫是个光荣的共产党员，参加过反帝战争，获得过红旗勋章，一九二九年集体农庄开始建立时，他用活生生的现实宣传教育着农民，把分散经营的小农组织起来走向集体主义的道路。他是个模范的家长，知道如何掌管家庭，教育孩子，为苏维埃国家培养新的一代。他用沉重的语句教育着自己的儿子：
    “像你这样的人，如果我们不在铁甲车和步兵队里作战，来改变命运，那么你恐怕注定了要绝望地终年贫苦过着农民的生活……
    “你童年的苦役为何会取消呢？那是因为我们已有了苏维埃政权，而这政权是不需要笨伯，不需要文盲和白痴的。现在只要求你一件事--主要的事--便是学习……”并且，他不是用父亲的威严来叱责孩子，而是用自己忠于党，忠于苏维埃国家，忠于劳动人民的热忱和业迹来教育孩子，把孩子琢磨成器。他信仰列宁斯大林，一生为着共产主义的思想而奋斗。这样便在无形中十分自然地给孩子灌输了良好的教养，使孩子不期会想起：我自己在父亲的新事业中能帮些什么忙呢？我觉得那位推倒暴君、打败各种敌人的列宁和斯大林伯伯，正在上面留心察看我的行动哩！……
    儿时的教养影响着未来的一生。苏奇·拉古诺夫终于加入列宁主义青年团。一位优秀的苏维埃英雄便这样锻炼出来了。
    旧中国的社会，把孩子看成家庭的私产，做父母的完全以自己一家利益的愿望教养孩子，给他们埋下了自私自利的恶根。今天，古老的国度翻身了，每一个从旧社会里走过来的人，都应该痛切地从头至尾去检查一下自己，纠正过去教养孩子的错误思想和态度；以自身的行动教育孩子，和新民主主义的国家利益紧紧结合在一起。这里，伊凡·拉古诺夫便是最好的榜样。
    《英雄的童年》更启示了我们每个年青的人，使我们想起：当中国共产党领导的英勇的人民解放军排除万难，缔造了新民主主义国家，把年青的一代提到新的生活环境里来的今天，我们应该怎样加紧锻炼和改造自己，为年青的祖国效劳啊！我们应该照着苏奇·拉古诺夫加入列宁主义青年团时所说的话去做：“读书又读书，学习各种科学，可能的话，要都学得好，必要时贡献你的生命、你的知识给你的国家。”
                一九五○，二，廿二
