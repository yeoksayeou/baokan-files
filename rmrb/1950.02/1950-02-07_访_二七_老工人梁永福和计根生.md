Visiting "February 7th" Veteran Workers Liang Yongfu and Ji Gensheng

By our reporter Ai Fang

The veteran workers Liang Yongfu and Ji Gensheng from the "February 7th" era have come to attend the National Congress of the Chinese Railway Workers' Union. Both are employee representatives from the Zhengtai Railway, one working in the railway union in Taiyuan, and the other doing administrative work at the Shijiazhuang Railway Factory. Both have worked on this railway for decades and were once good comrades fighting unyieldingly against the enemy.

When the reporter met them, they had just returned from a meeting. They were still studying the railway's production plan for 1950, as well as issues like labor insurance and worker welfare, with several meeting materials spread on the table. They are both around sixty years old, with graying hair, but their spirit is strong. Just as they said themselves, "We are old, but our hearts are not. We hope to serve the people for a few more days!"

Mentioning "February 7th" brought back many memories for Liang Yongfu and Ji Gensheng! They began to talk freely. They remembered every detail very clearly, as if they were talking about yesterday's events. Those bloody struggles deeply imprinted on their hearts would never be forgotten!

Liang Yongfu said: "The Zhengtai Railway was built by French imperialists. Every piece of iron and wood for building the railway had to come from them. The warlords owed them debts, so they managed the railway. The imperialists, warlords, and their running dogs desperately squeezed the workers and the Chinese people. They didn't treat the workers like human beings. To get into the factory, you had to give them gifts. You had to call them 'Master'..." He said, "That was the reason for the strike."

The major strike occurred in August 1922, starting from the Beijing-Hankou Railway. In December, the wave of strikes spread to the Zhengtai Railway. At that time, once the union issued an order, trains stopped wherever they were. The workers put forward eight demands, including wage increases, the abolition of all unreasonable systems, the establishment of worker welfare programs, and a guarantee that no workers would be fired for striking. The Zhengtai Railway workers formed a picket队, with Ji Gensheng as the captain. The enemy's armed forces were blockaded in their buildings by the workers' strength. At Yangquan Station, a fake police section chief surnamed Luo led people to suppress the workers. The workers rushed forward, led by Liang Yongfu, but he failed to grab him, and the guy ran away. In Shijiazhuang, the enemy bought off a bad element named Wang Chun, who carried a pistol and was followed by a French imperialist. The running dog Wang Chun said, "If you're an enemy, come forward; if you're a friend, step back." Before he finished speaking, Ji Gensheng snatched his gun from behind, and the imperialist also ran away, losing his leather shoes in the square. The workers paraded and demonstrated, shouting "Down with imperialism!" and "Down with the warlords!"

This strike movement received support from the vast number of workers on various railways. This fully demonstrated the spirit of mutual aid and fraternal love of the working class.

"When you are tough, the enemy will soften." Liang Yongfu said: "This struggle was a victory, and the enemy was forced to respond to the workers' demands." Liang Yongfu and Ji Gensheng spoke with great excitement. Everyone was very excited. He said that the more serious struggle was on February 7th of the following year, the so-called "February 7th."

On January 29, 1923, representatives from all stations along the Beijing-Hankou Railway were sent to Zhengzhou to attend the founding meeting of the Beijing-Hankou Railway General Union. Representatives from other railways were also invited to participate, and Liang Yongfu also attended. This was a meeting for the working class to consolidate and expand its victory and to prepare a new offensive against the enemy. This was a meeting of great unity among railway workers, demonstrating their unparalleled power. The imperialists and their pawns – the warlord Wu Peifu, etc. – trembled in the face of the workers' power. The enemy armed forces interfered with the workers' meeting. A large number of military police were sent to surround the venue and disrupt the meeting. Workers' representatives from various places paraded and demonstrated under the banner of "Labor is sacred." The porters of Zhengzhou also joined this solemn procession. The representatives also resolved that workers on all railways would strike on February 7th to protest the conspiracies and atrocities of the warlord politicians. The struggle became increasingly acute.

First, the Beijing-Hankou Railway went on strike. The enemy captured the labor leader who was directly leading this movement at the time — the outstanding Communist Party members Lin Xiangqian and Shi Yang, among others. The enemy forced him to issue an order to resume traffic. Comrade Liang Yongfu said: "Comrade Lin Xiangqian replied to the enemy: 'Heads can be cut off, but trains cannot pass!' ... Comrades Lin Xiangqian, Shi Yang, and others were martyred gloriously."

The enemy used despicable and shameless means of bloody massacre.

Speaking of this, Comrade Liang Yongfu thought of the martyr Gao Keqiang. He said that Comrade Gao Keqiang was a young student in his twenties at the time. He dropped out of school and devoted himself to the workers' movement, working very enthusiastically as a secretary in the union at the time. Therefore, the enemy paid close attention to him. After a large parade, he was captured by the enemy.

Liang Yongfu faced Ji Gensheng and said: "We have mentioned several times that we want to build a memorial tower to commemorate the martyrs, but everyone is busy with work, and this matter has not been done until now." Ji Gensheng added: "Let's commemorate them with our work!" Indeed, they are all commemorating the martyrs with their actual work. After the liberation of Shijiazhuang, a serious problem was faced: restoring production. After one competition and another, Ji Gensheng was elected as a labor model by everyone and was promoted by the factory to be the deputy director of the tool department. At the first People's Representative Conference in Shijiazhuang, he and Yan Jinfen from the Daxing Textile Factory were elected as members of the Shijiazhuang Municipal Government.

After the liberation of Shijiazhuang, Liang Yongfu worked in the trade union. In August 1948, he attended the Sixth National Labor Congress. In May 1949, he attended the North China Workers' Representative Conference. In June, he went abroad to participate in the Second Congress of the World Federation of Trade Unions. He is such a talkative person, obviously an outstanding social activist.

The struggle history of Comrades Liang Yongfu and Ji Gensheng tells us how the broad masses of Chinese workers have changed from a persecuted status to become the masters of the country.

When talking about the production tasks required by the Ministry of Railways in 1950, they both expressed full confidence. Of course, this requires even greater effort to achieve. In order to better complete the task, Liang Yongfu humbly examined himself. He said: "I still have shortcomings, the biggest one is that I don't have a high level of education. I must make up for this lesson in the future."

　　访“二七”老工人梁永福和计根生
    本报记者  艾方
    “二七”时代的老工人梁永福和计根生，来出席中国铁路工会全国代表大会了。他们两个，都是正太路的职工代表，一个是在太原做铁路工会工作，一个是在石家庄铁路工厂做行政工作。两个人都是在这条路上工作了几十年，过去，又是携手向敌人作不屈斗争的好伙伴。
    记者见到他们时，他们是刚开会回来。两个人还在研究着一九五Ｏ年铁路上的生产计划和劳动保险及工人福利等问题，桌子上摆了几份会议上印发的材料。他们已经都是六十岁上下的人了，须发斑白，但精神是健旺的。正像他们自己所说的，“人是老了，心还不老，希望着能多当几天人民的勤务员呢！”
    提起了“二七”，梁永福和计根生的心里想起了多少往事！他们畅谈起来了。每一个细节他们都记得很清楚，像谈昨天的事情一样。那些深深地烙印在心上的血的斗争是永不会忘记的啊！
    梁永福说：“正太路是法帝国主义修的。修路的一铁一木都要从他们手里来。军阀们欠下他们的债，铁路就由他们来管。帝国主义、军阀和他们的走狗，就拚命向工人的身上来刮，向中国老百姓身上刮。他们拿着工人就不当人。工人进厂，要给他送礼。称呼他们，必须叫老爷……。”他说：“这就是罢工的原因”。
    那次大罢工，发生在一九二二年的八月间，从京汉路开始。十二月里，罢工浪潮就波及到正太路。当时工会的一道命令下去，车开到哪里就停到了哪里。工人们提出了八个条件，要求增加工资，要求取消一切不合理制度，要求建立工人福利事业，……不准因为罢工开除工人。正太路工人们成立了纠察队，计根生就是队长。敌人的武装被工人的力量封锁到屋里。在阳泉车站，一个姓罗的伪警务段长，带着人去弹压工人，工人们一涌而上，梁永福领头，一把没抓住，那家伙撒腿跑了。在石家庄，敌人收买坏分子王纯，带着手枪，屁股后头跟着个法帝国主义分子。走狗王纯说：“是冤家就向前，是朋友就向后”，话没有说完，计根生就从后面把他的枪夺了，帝国主义分子也吓跑了，跑得把皮鞋都丢在广场上。工人们游行示威，高呼“打倒帝国主义”，“打倒军阀”。
    这个罢工运动，是得到了各路广大工人的声援的。这充分地表现了工人阶级的互助友爱精神。
    “当你强硬起来的时候，敌人是会软下去的”。梁永福说：“这次斗争是胜利了，敌人被迫答复了工人的要求。”梁永福和计根生谈起来，眉飞色舞的。大家非常兴奋。他说，更严重的斗争是在第二年二月七日，就是所说的“二七”。
    一九二三年一月廿九日，京汉铁路全线各站工人都派了代表，到郑州开京汉铁路总工会的成立大会。同时也邀请了其他铁路代表参加，梁永福也去参加了。这是工人阶级巩固并扩大自己的胜利，向敌人布置新的进攻的会。这是铁路工人大团结，显示出了自己无比威力的会。帝国主义及其爪牙——军阀吴佩孚等，在工人们的力量面前，吓得发抖。敌人武装干涉工人开会。派出大批军警，包围会场，捣乱会议，各地工人代表，在“劳工神圣”的大旗下，游行示威。郑州的搬运工人也都参加了这个庄严的行列。代表们并决议，二月七日这天起，各路工人罢工，以抗议军阀政客的阴谋暴行。斗争愈来愈尖锐了。
    首先京汉路罢了工。敌人捕了当时直接领导这个运动的工人领袖——优秀的共产党员林祥谦、施洋等同志，敌人强逼着他下通车命令。梁永福同志说：“林祥谦同志这样回答了敌人：‘头可断，车不可通！’……林祥谦、施洋等同志壮烈牺牲了。”
    敌人使用了卑劣无耻的血腥屠杀手段。
    谈到这里，梁永福同志又想起了高克强烈士。他说，高克强同志当时是个二十来岁的青年学生，辍了学，投入到工人运动中来，在当时工会里当秘书，工作非常热心。因此，敌人非常注意他。在一次大游行之后，他被敌人捕去了。
    梁永福面对着计根生说：“我们几次提起要建立个纪念塔，来纪念烈士们，大家工作忙，这件事一直到现在还没做了。”计根生补充说：“就拿我们的工作来纪念吧！”的确，他们都是以自己的实际工作来纪念烈士的。石家庄解放后，面对着一个严重问题，就是恢复生产。一次竞赛运动，两次竞赛运动，计根生被大家选为劳动模范，又被工厂提拔为工具部的副主任。石市第一次人民代表会议上，和大兴纱厂阎金芬一同被选为石家庄市政府的委员。
    石家庄解放后，梁永福就做工会工作，一九四八年八月，出席第六次全国劳动大会。一九四九年五月出席华北职工代表会议。六月出国，参加世界工联第二次代表大会。人是那么健谈，显然是一个出色的社会活动家。
    从梁永福和计根生同志的奋斗历史，告诉了我们，中国的广大工人，是怎样从被迫害的地位变成了国家的主人翁。
    谈到一九五○年铁道部所要求的生产任务时，他们都表示有充分的信心。当然，这是要更加努力才能获得的。为了更好地完成任务，梁永福虚心地检讨了自己。他说：“我还有缺点，最大的一个，就是文化程度不高。我今后一定要补上这一课。”
