Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, February 25th: TASS, Moscow reports: A "News" commentator, on February 23rd, commented on the Bangkok conference of American diplomats stationed in the Far East, stating: After the failure of the United States' Far East policy, the Bangkok conference had to discuss the situation in various Asian countries based on reports submitted by American diplomatic representatives. The commentator wrote: American capitalists are trying to conclude a separate peace treaty with Japan in order to prolong the occupation and complete the transformation of Japan into a strategic springboard against the Soviet Union and the People's Democratic countries. The Bangkok conference also seeks to reach an agreement on methods of implementing the Fourth Point Program in order to find ways for American capital to penetrate South and Southeast Asia. The commentator pointed out: The State Department, which convened the Bangkok conference, is acting in the interests of American monopoly capitalists, who have been gradually seizing control of the production of rubber, tin, oil, and other valuable raw materials in this region. Even Jessup's report at the meeting was compiled by Fosdick, a representative of the Rockefeller-controlled bank, and Case, a representative of General Motors and the Central Investment Corporation. (Note: Fosdick and Case participated in the State Department's 'Special Group' for studying the Far East policy of aggression under the guise of so-called "Far East problem consultants.")
The commentary continued: Long before the Bangkok conference, the American ruling group had decided to turn Indochina into a base for suppressing the national liberation movement in Asia. However, actual developments have shown that American imperialism's bet on Bao Dai overestimated its strength and possibilities and underestimated the strength and possibilities of the Indochinese national liberation movement. Although the American and British governments have attempted to mobilize the ruling groups of India, Pakistan, Ceylon, and Thailand to recognize the Bao Dai regime, the latter still do not want to rashly recognize Bao Dai, who is supported by the colonizers' guns, and thus damage their credibility among their own people.
The commentator concluded the Bangkok conference by stating: No conference of imperialist diplomats can change the inevitable trend of events, which is clearly developing in a direction unfavorable to world imperialism in Asia.

　　消息报评曼谷会议
    美帝阴谋长期占领日本
    并企图对东南亚施行经济掠夺
    【新华社北京二十五日电】据塔斯社莫斯科讯：消息报评论员二十三日评美国驻远东外交人员的曼谷会议称：在美国的远东政策遭到失败之后，曼谷会议不得不根据美国外交代表提出的报告，讨论亚洲各个国家的形势。评论员写道：美国资本家正在设法缔结一种对日单独和约，以便拖长占领，并完成将日本转化为反苏、反人民民主国家的战略跳板。曼谷会议也要在实施第四点计划的方法问题上获得协议，以寻求美国资本渗入南亚与东南亚的方法。评论员指出：召集曼谷会议的国务院是以美国大垄断资本家的利益为依归的，它们已经一点一滴地把这片地区内的橡胶、锡、石油和其他有价值的原料生产抓到手中。甚至连耶塞普在会上所作的报告，也是由洛克菲勒所控制的银行的代表福斯迪克和通用汽车公司、中央投资产业公司的代表凯斯所编订的。（按：福斯迪克和凯斯二人系以所谓“远东问题顾问”的面貌，参加美国国务院研究侵略远东政策的‘特别小组’。）
    评论继称：在曼谷会议以前很久，美国统治集团就已决定将印度支那变成镇压亚洲民族解放运动的据点。但实际的发展表明：美帝国主义将赌注押在保大身上，是过高估计了它的力量和可能性，过低估计了印度支那民族解放运动的力量和可能性。美、英政府虽曾企图发动印度、巴基斯坦、锡兰和泰国的统治集团承认保大政权，但后者迄今还不想冒然承认殖民者枪杆所撑起来的保大，而使它们在自己人民中间的威信受到损害。
    评论员在总结曼谷会议时称：帝国主义外交家的任何会议都不能改变事态发展的必然趋势，这种趋势在亚洲显然是朝着对世界帝国主义不利的方向发展着。
