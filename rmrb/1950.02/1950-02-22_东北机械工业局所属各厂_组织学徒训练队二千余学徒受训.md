　　【News from this newspaper】Northeast News: Factories affiliated with the Northeast Mechanical Industry Bureau have organized apprentice training teams to systematically train apprentices. According to statistics from January 10th, the number of new and old apprentices who have joined the teams and are receiving training has reached over 2,500. The number of apprentices trained by each factory varies depending on its actual needs and existing equipment conditions. Some factories train as few as 50 people, while others train around 400. For example, the Fifth Machine Factory, which produces precision machinery, has a particular need for skilled workers and is therefore training 360 apprentices. The teaching content of the apprentice training teams in each factory varies according to the needs of the factory's work. For example, the curriculum for apprentices at the Automobile General Factory includes mechanical knowledge, blueprint reading, and practical training. During the practical training period, each experienced technical worker is assigned to guide one apprentice. Instructors for the training teams are mostly hired from within the unit. For example, the technical courses for the apprentice training team at the Automobile General Factory are taught in rotation by technical personnel from the factory and its affiliated branches, while the political courses are the responsibility of the factory's Personnel Section. The training teams in each factory have begun to establish a certain learning system, stipulating that exams are held once a month, and those who perform well are commended, while those who perform poorly are criticized. This work of training apprentices encountered problems at the beginning. For example, the curriculum standards at the Tool Factory were selected too high, and apprentices were not assigned to classes according to their level, which affected their learning. This has now been corrected.

　　东北机械工业局所属各厂
    组织学徒训练队二千余学徒受训
    【本报讯】东北消息：东北机械工业管理局所属各厂，组织学徒训练队，有计划地训练徒工。据上月十日统计，入队受训的新、旧学徒，已达二千五百余名。各厂根据其实际需要及现有的设备条件，训练徒工的人数多少不同。少者训练五十多人，多者训练四百人左右。如第五机器厂，因做精密机器，特别需要技工，故训练学徒三百六十人。各厂学徒训练队的教学内容，依各厂工作的需要各不相同。如汽车总厂学徒的学习课程，规定为机械常识、看图、实习等。实习期间，固定每名老技术工人指导一名学徒。训练队的教员多从本单位延聘，如汽车总厂的学徒训练队，技术课由该厂及所属各分厂的技术人员轮流担任，政治课由该厂人事科负责。各厂训练队已开始建立了一定的学习制度，规定每月考试一次，成绩好的予以表扬，坏的将受批评。这一训练学徒的工作，开始时曾出过毛病。如工具厂课程标准选得过高，学徒未依程度分班，曾影响学徒的学习，现已得到纠正。
