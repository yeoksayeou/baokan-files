　　The great artistic images of the Soviet Red Army, meticulously created by the "engineers of the human soul"—the great Soviet people's writers and poets—through literature, drama, and film, have had an extremely wide and profound influence on our Chinese People's Liberation Army. The great Soviet writers not only inspired and encouraged us with their boundless hatred for the enemy and their fiery patriotism that permeated every line, but also created great images of Soviet heroes as examples for us to learn from. Furthermore, through these artistic images, they provided us with significant and practical enlightenment on military thinking, the views and methods of building and governing the army, tactical innovation, and political education. Judging from the widespread influence and practical effects of these works, it is no exaggeration to say that they have become an invisible military force for our People's Liberation Army in the war to defeat the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang.

　　Korneichuk's "The Front," Simonov's "Days and Nights," Grossman's "The People Are Immortal," Pigalev's biography of the outstanding Russian military strategist Suvorov—"Soldier and Commander," as well as the films "Thirteen Brave Men," "The Kronstadt Rebellion," etc., and especially Bek's description of the arduous creation of the Panfilov Division—"Fear and Courage," because of its profound thought, concise description, and vigorous style, are endlessly read by the commanders of our troops. Almost without exception, from senior generals to junior commanders, they read it. Some even studied it closely four or five times. We not only regard it as extremely valuable literary reading material but also treat it as a precious military textbook, seriously studying it as Marxist-Leninist military theory. The great Soviet writers Fadeyev, Korneichuk, Ehrenburg, Simonov, Bek... have become very familiar and beloved names in our People's Liberation Army. The protagonists in their works: Olenyev, Savurov, Panfilov, Bavurzhan... have become admired and familiar figures in the army. In the highly mobile operations and marches of our People's Liberation Army, the troops have reached the highest degree of light equipment. People even parted with their most precious souvenirs, but good books like "Fear and Courage" and "Days and Nights" always occupied a position in the simple marching bags, following us through mountains and rivers, becoming good companions in battle.

　　"Fear and Courage" was translated into Chinese in June 1945, printed in large quantities, and widely circulated in the People's Liberation Army as a required document for commanders. Although the number of publications was not accurately counted, it was always in the tens of thousands in the troops of each strategic area (some troops even compiled popular versions to suit the cultural level of the soldiers). The People's Liberation Army's Liu Bocheng and Nie Rongzhen's newspaper—People's Warrior News, Soldiers' News, Comrade-in-Arms News, Frontline News and many battlefield newspapers specifically published articles introducing and calling on all army commanders to seriously study it. Many troops also stipulated to use it as a textbook, specifically arranging courses for teaching. Teng Daiyuan, Deputy Commander of the Shanxi-Hebei-Shandong-Henan Military Region, personally designated "Fear and Courage" and "Days and Nights" as required documents for cadres above the regiment level at the troop training meetings. Senior generals of the People's Liberation Army Liu Bocheng and Xu Xiangqian and senior commanders of the army corps Yang Dezhi, Yang Chengwu, and Chen Zhengxiang often personally called on the troops to study it, and often cited stories and views from "Fear and Courage" and "Days and Nights" as examples in speeches, military training, and in meetings to study battles, to criticize the bad tendencies in the troops of not paying attention to discipline and training "only relying on courage, not talking about tactics," and called on troop commanders to understand the theme of "Fear and Courage," to strive to learn tactics, carefully fight, and strictly manage and train the troops. At the training meeting of the troops under his command, General Xu Xiangqian called on all officers and soldiers to study "Days and Nights" well. He said, "Days and Nights" describes two typical military cadres of the Soviet Red Army: one is battalion commander Savurov, who is a typical soldier with both intelligence and courage. The other is regimental commander Pavchenko, who is a typical narrow-minded empiricist with courage but no intelligence. Savurov became a hero who defeated the enemy, while Pavchenko made a senseless sacrifice. We should learn a good lesson from this."

　　When "Fear and Courage" was circulating in the army, the war our People's Liberation Army was waging against the Kuomintang bandit gang was in an extremely tense stage. We seized modern weapons from the enemy to equip ourselves, and we were transforming from guerrilla warfare to large-scale mobile warfare and positional offensive warfare, calling on troop commanders to strive to learn modern command art, to fight with wisdom, to strengthen discipline education, and to train the vast armed peasants from "fear" to "courage." This became an important course in army building. It was precisely at such a time that "Fear and Courage" was introduced to the army very appropriately. The book's description of the Soviet army's training policy, the method of inspiring morale "not to die, but to live," the view of army management that focuses on difficulties in troop training, Panfilov's training of his subordinates with a high degree of discipline and accurate work style, and the view that commanders should fight the enemy with intelligence, all played a powerful role in promoting the training of our troops at that time and the upsurge of tactical research that was being set off. "Learn from Bavurzhan, fight with wisdom!" became a well-known slogan for the commanders of the troops. In daily life, one could almost always hear people talking about the stories of Panfilov and Bavurzhan. People often extracted the book's incisive warnings and wrote them into battlefield mobilization slogans and posted them in trenches, shelters, and command posts.

　　In the editorial departments of our battlefield newspapers, we often received insights and thoughts from troop commanders after reading "Fear and Courage," and criticized their own thoughts in the articles. Comrade Shi Xiong, a battalion commander under General Liu Bocheng, reviewed his shortcomings in command and future goals based on the inspiration of Bavurzhan in the battle to besiege Anyang. Such discussions widely attracted the attention of the troops and greatly helped everyone's interest in studying tactics.

　　I remember that in the Qingfengdian campaign in which the Kuomintang army's Third Army was annihilated on the North China battlefield, our participating troops rushed to the attack location after a forced march of 280 miles in two days and one night. The soldiers were put into battle in a very tired state. Some troops, because of condoning the fatigue of the soldiers, did not strictly require them to build the field fortifications practically. The soil was too thin and the gun holes were too high. At that time, the senior commander of the troops immediately used the spirit of Bavurzhan to correct this tendency. He said, "Comrades: Are we fighting to die? To live?" The soldiers said, "To live!" "To live, we must eliminate the enemy and preserve ourselves. If our fortifications are not well built, can we kill the enemy? Can such thin soil withstand the enemy's shells? If we want to live, we must cover it with five more feet of soil and rebuild the gun holes! Comrades: Your company commander is letting you sleep at this time, this is not caring for you, it is letting you die! Understand?" Under such mobilization, the already very tired soldiers immediately cheered up and quickly completed the task of transforming the fortifications. In the offensive battle of Shijiazhuang, many troops under General Nie Rongzhen specifically studied the chapter in "Days and Nights" describing Savurov's command of a building battle in Stalingrad in the preparation of the battle. In the campaign to capture Taiyuan, General Xu Xiangqian's troops similarly printed an abstract of this chapter into battlefield leaflets and distributed them to the troops responsible for street fighting, because it provided specific images of the tactical essentials of street fighting, which was an extremely valuable reference for commanders. In Comrade Yu Tongxian's platoon, a squad leader under General Liu Bocheng, he was influenced by "Fear and Courage" to lead the new soldiers in his platoon who lacked combat training and showed fear to fight. He often put forward his slogan to the new soldiers: "Bullets have no eyes, but we have eyes." As long as we dig good fortifications and understand tactics, we can preserve ourselves and eliminate the enemy. Once, after the enemy's plane strafed, he ordered four soldiers to find the traces of the bullets and measure them with steps. The distance between every two bullet points was tens of feet away. He said, "Comrades! The plane looks fierce, but the bullets it shoots are far apart from each other. As long as we understand its performance, we can pass through its gaps. What's so scary about this?" The four soldiers admired the squad leader's opinion. Under the leadership of Comrade Yu Tongxian, the new soldiers in this squad became warriors on the battlefield. Now many soldiers understand that we fight "not to die, but to live." When they participate in the daredevil team, they express their determination like this: "We must live, only by living can we complete the task!"

　　Our People's Liberation Army has been tempered by more than three years of the People's Liberation War. We have achieved considerable results in troop training and tactical research, and have made many creations and developments. For example, we have promoted the wisdom and creativity of the soldiers in organizing battles, carried out mass comments after battles, and Zhuge Liang meetings before battles, advocated technology and bravery, advocated "learning from war in war," military democracy under highly centralized guidance, etc. This is the result of the wise guidance of Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu's military thinking and the efforts of all comrades, and the excellent Soviet wartime literature has indeed given us many inspirations and help. The comrades of the People's Liberation Army thank our great friend—the Soviet people's writers for writing such good books for us! Now the Chinese People's Liberation War has achieved a basic victory, and our People's Liberation Army is entering a new period of regularization and modernization construction. Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu called on us to continue to strengthen politically and militarily, and build a modern and powerful people's army, navy, and air force. The army building of our great ally—the Soviet Union—is our model to learn from. The image of the Soviet Red Army created by the great Soviet writers and the works reflecting the Soviet army building are even more urgently needed by us. We hope that the translators of our new China will introduce a large amount of such valuable spiritual food to our People's Liberation Army!

　　苏联战时文学成了我们无形的军事力量
　　姚远方
    按此文曾发表于《文艺报》，内容是具体地叙述苏联战时文学作品在我国人民解放军部队中的巨大影响。现经作者加以修改和补充，特在本刊发表。
    ——编者
    “人类灵魂的工程师”——伟大的苏维埃人民作家和诗人们，通过文学、戏剧和电影所精心创造的苏联红军的伟大艺术形象，在我们中国人民解放军中具有极为广泛与深刻的影响。伟大的苏维埃作家不仅以他们对敌人的无比憎恨，以他们贯透每行每字的火一样的爱国主义，鼓舞了我们，振奋了我们，他们不仅创造了伟大的苏联英雄形象，作为我们学习的榜样，并且通过了艺术形象在军事思想上，建军治军的观点方法上，战术创造和政治教育上给了我们以重大而实际的启示。从这些作品的广泛影响和实际效果来看，毫不夸张地说，它已成为我们人民解放军在战胜蒋介石匪帮的战争中的无形的军事力量。
    高涅楚克的“前线”，西蒙诺夫的“日日夜夜”，格罗斯曼的“人民是不朽的”，皮加别夫著的俄罗斯杰出军事家苏沃洛夫的传记——“士兵兼统帅”，以及电影：“十三勇士”、“克伦斯坦海军暴动”等等，特别是别克著的描述潘菲洛夫师团艰苦缔造的可歌可泣的历史——“恐惧与无畏”，由于这本书思想的深刻，描写的简明，词锋的刚健，更使我们部队广大指挥员所百读不厌，从高级将领直至下级指挥员几乎是毫无例外的读它，有的甚至精读了四五遍，我们不仅把它看成极有价值的文艺读物，而且把它当为宝贵的军事教科书，当作马列主义的军事学说来认真钻研。伟大的苏维埃作家法捷耶夫、高涅楚克、爱伦堡、西蒙诺夫、别克……在我们人民解放军中，成为非常熟悉而敬爱的名字，他们作品中的主人翁：欧洛涅夫、沙伏洛夫、潘菲洛夫、巴武尔章……已经成为部队中景仰而熟悉的人物。我们解放军在高度野战化的作战与行军中，部队达到了最高度的轻装，人们甚至把自己最可贵的纪念品都割爱了，但像“恐惧与无畏”和“日日夜夜”这样的好书，总是在简单的行军囊中占有着位置，跟着我们跋山涉水，成为战斗中的良好伴侣。
    “恐惧与无畏”这本书，在一九四五年六月就翻译成中文，大量印发，并作为指挥员必读的文件在人民解放军中广泛流传，出版的数量虽然没有准确的统计，但在每个战略区的部队总是数以万计（有的部队为了适合战士的文化水平，还编写了通俗本）。人民解放军刘伯承与聂荣臻将军所部的机关报——人民战士报、子弟兵报、战友报、前线报和许许多多的战地报纸都专门发表论文介绍并号召全军指挥员认真攻读。许多部队并规定以此为课本，具体排定课程，进行讲授。晋冀鲁豫军区滕代远副司令员，曾亲自在部队的训教会议上将“恐惧与无畏”与“日日夜夜”规定为团以上干部必读文件，人民解放军的高级将领刘伯承徐向前和兵团的高级指挥员杨德志、杨成武、陈正湘诸将军时常亲自号召部队来研究它，并时常在讲话中，在军事训练中，在研究战役的会议上，列举“恐惧与无畏”和“日日夜夜”中的故事和观点为例证，来批判部队中不重视纪律，不重视训练“只凭勇气，不讲战术”的不良倾向，号召部队指挥员领会“恐惧与无畏”的主题思想，努力学习战术，精心作战，严格部队的管理和训练。徐向前将军在所属部队的训教会议上，曾号召全体指战员好好学习“日日夜夜”，他说“日日夜夜”上描述了苏联红军两个典型的军事干部：一个是营长沙布洛夫，那是智勇双全的典型军人。一个是团长巴甫琴科，那是狭隘经验论者有勇无谋的典型。沙布洛夫成了战胜敌人的英雄，而巴甫琴科却作了无谓的牺牲者，我们从这中间应得到很好的教训。
    当“恐惧与无畏”在部队中流传的时候，我们人民解放军所进行的反对国民党匪帮的战争，正处在异常紧张的阶段，我们从敌人手里夺取了现代化武器装备了自己，我们正从游击战争转变为大规模的运动战和阵地攻坚战，号召部队指挥员努力学习现代化的指挥艺术，用智慧作战，加强纪律教育，使广大武装了的农民从“恐惧”训练成“无畏”，这成为军队建设中的重要课程，正在这样的时期，“恐惧与无畏”非常适合时宜的介绍到部队中来了。这本书所描述苏联军队的训练方针，“不是要死，而是要活”的激励士气的方法，部队训练从困难着眼的治军观点，潘菲洛夫训练部属高度纪律精神和准确的工作作风以及指挥员要同敌人斗智的观点，这对于当时我们部队的训练和正在掀起的研究战术的热潮，起到了有力的推动作用，“学习巴武尔章，用智慧作战！”成为部队指挥员的人人通晓的警语。在日常生活中几乎随处可以听说人们在谈论关于潘菲洛夫和巴武尔章的故事，人们时常摘取这本书中的精辟的警语写成战场的鼓动标语贴在战壕掩护部和指挥所里。
    在我们战地报纸的编辑部，时常可以收到部队指挥员们写来的读“恐惧与无畏”的心得和感想，并在文章中联系他们的思想进行自我批评，刘伯承将军所部的一个营长——石雄同志，他在围攻安阳的战斗中，根据巴武尔章的启示，来检讨自己指挥上的缺点和今后努力目标，这样的讨论，广泛地引起部队的重视，对于大家研究战术的兴趣，有了很大的帮助。
    我记得，在华北战场歼灭国民党军第三军的清风店战役中，当时我们参战部队，以两天一夜走二百八十里的急行军，赶到攻击地点，战士们在十分疲惫的情况下投入战斗，有些部队因为姑息战士的疲劳，没有严格的要求他们把野战工事切实的构筑好，土太薄，枪眼太高，当时部队的高级指挥员立即引用巴武尔章精神纠正此种倾向，他说：“同志们：咱们作战是为了死？为了活？”战士们说：“为了活！”“为了活就必须消灭敌人，保存自己，咱们工事做不好，能打死敌人吗？土这样薄能经得住敌人的炮弹吗？我们要活，就必要再盖上五尺土，把枪眼重新改造！同志们：你们连长让你们在这样时候去睡觉，这不是爱护你们，是让你们去死！懂得吗？”在这样的鼓动下，已经十分疲惫的战士们立刻振作起来了，迅速地完成了改造工事的任务。在石家庄的攻坚战中，聂荣臻将军所部的许多部队，在战役的准备中，专门研究了“日日夜夜”中描述沙伏洛夫指挥斯大林格拉的一个楼房战斗的一章；徐向前将军所部在攻取太原的战役中，同样的将这一章的摘要印成战场传单，发给担任巷战的部队，因为其中以具体的形象提供了市街战斗的战术要领，对指挥员们是极有价值的参考。在刘伯承将军所部的一个班长——于同贤同志，他就是接受“恐惧与无畏”的影响，来带领他班里的缺乏战斗锻炼的而表现得恐惧的新战士作战，他经常向新战士们提出他的一句口号：“子弹没眼，咱们有眼”只要咱们挖好工事，懂得战术，咱们就能够保存自己消灭敌人，有一次敌人飞机扫射过后，他命令四个战士去寻找子弹打的痕迹，并用步子测量一下，每两个弹着点的距离都在丈数来远，他说：“同志们！飞机看起来很凶，但他打的子弹间彼此距离很远，只要我们懂得它的性能，我们就能够在它的空隙中穿过，这有什么可怕呢？”四个战士都佩服班长的见解。在于同贤同志领导下，以后这个班的新战士都成为战场上的勇士了。现在许多战士们他们懂得了我们打仗“不是为了死，是为了活”，当他们参加奋勇队的时候，他们是这样表示自己的决心：“我们一定要活着，活着我们才能完成任务！”
    我们人民解放军经过三年多人民解放战争的锤炼，我们在部队的训练和战术的研究上，取得了可观的成绩，并有了许多创造和发展，例如我们在组织战斗中发扬了士兵群众的智慧和创造精神，进行战斗以后的群众性评论，和战斗前的诸葛亮会，提倡技术和勇敢，提倡“以战教战”，在高度集中指导下的军事民主等等，这是毛主席朱总司令军事思想英明指导和全体同志努力的结果，而苏维埃优秀的战时文学也的确给我们许多启示和帮助，我们人民解放军同志感谢我们伟大的友人——苏维埃的人民作家给我们写了这样好的书！现在中国人民解放战争已取得基本的胜利，我们人民解放军正进入正规化现代化建设的新时期，毛主席朱总司令号召我们在政治上军事上继续加强，建设一支现代化强大的人民陆军，海军和空军，我们伟大友邦——苏联的军队建设是我们的学习榜样，伟大苏维埃作家所创造的苏联红军的形象，和反映苏联军队建设的作品，更为我们所迫切需要，希望我们新中国的翻译工作者们，大量的把这样可贵的精神食粮介绍给我们解放军吧！
