Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, February 10th: TASS, Moscow, February 9th: Viktorov wrote an article in *Pravda*, elaborating on Acheson's recent two failures. The author pointed out that Acheson's speech at the National Press Club on January 12th was primarily a malicious slander against the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and the Mongolian People's Republic. Acheson's bizarre fabrications about Soviet policy toward China have been fully exposed in the Soviet Foreign Minister's statement of January 21st. This statement, based on irrefutable facts, has effectively shattered Acheson's fabrications.

　　Acheson's speech aroused deep indignation among the broadest sections of the Chinese people. The U.S. Secretary of State's attempt to pose as a "friend of China" was particularly infuriating. The statement issued by the Director of the News Administration of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China gave Acheson's speech the condemnation it deserved. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Mongolian People's Republic also appropriately rebuked the U.S. Secretary of State.

　　Viktorov pointed out that the State Department, headed by Acheson, hastily fabricated an "explanatory document" to support the Secretary of State's speech at the National Press Club on January 12th, in order to justify himself. But this so-called "background document" is merely a despicable attempt to cover up an "orderly" retreat in the face of irrefutable facts. This document does not even mention the so-called Soviet "merger" or "annexation" of this or that region of China. The author of this document is single-mindedly avoiding using the words that Acheson wielded so wantonly. But in order to compensate for this defect, the author of this document attempts to secretly introduce more concealed slander and libel. However, they are no more successful in this than Acheson.

　　Viktorov continued: From mythology, we know that if the gods want to punish someone, they must first make him mad. The authors of the "explanatory document" planned by the U.S. State Department are in just such a situation. When the world knows that Soviet-Chinese negotiations are being held in Moscow, with the Chairman of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China, the Premier of the Government Administration Council of the People's Republic of China, and representatives of the Northeast People's Government and the Xinjiang Provincial Government participating, these authors talk about some special relationship between the Soviet Union and Xinjiang, and some "individual" negotiations between the Soviet Union and certain regions of China. The complete bankruptcy of the document published by the U.S. State Department to "explain" and "support" Acheson's statement is abundantly clear.

　　Acheson, in his January 12th speech, relied on venomous anti-Soviet clamor to cover up the complete failure of his policy toward China. He has failed. His second failure is the "explanatory document" issued by the State Department. Viktorov concluded that continuing this policy can only lead to new failures. These new failures cannot be prevented by any "background document" from the State Department. If the document is based on malicious distortion of facts and slanderous accusations, then failure is even more unavoidable.

　　苏联中国蒙古的严正声明  把艾奇逊的杜撰打得粉碎
    美国务院的“解释”又招致新的失败
    真理报发表维克托洛夫论文
    【新华社北京十日电】塔斯社莫斯科九日讯：维克托洛夫在真理报上撰文，详论艾奇逊最近遭到的两次失败。作者指出：艾奇逊一月十二日在美国全国新闻俱乐部发表的演说，主要是针对苏联以及中华人民共和国与蒙古人民共和国的一种恶意诽谤。艾奇逊关于苏联对华政策的离奇杜撰，已在苏联外长一月二十一日的声明中被充分地揭露了。这项声明根据无可置辩的事实，实际上已把艾奇逊的杜撰打得粉碎。
    艾奇逊的演说引起了中国人民的最广大阶层的深切愤慨。美国国务卿试图冒充“中国之友”，尤其使人们愤慨。中华人民共和国中央人民政府新闻总署署长所发表的声明，给艾奇逊的演说以应得的谴责。蒙古人民共和国外交部也适当地斥责了美国国务卿。
    维克托洛夫指出：以艾奇逊为首的国务院，为了自圆其说，急急忙忙地伪造了一个“解释性的文件”，想用它来支持国务卿一月十二日在全国新闻俱乐部上发表的演说。但这个所谓“背景文件”，不过是卑鄙地妄图在无可置辩的事实面前，用以掩护“有秩序”的退却而已。这个文件甚至已经不提所谓苏联“合并”或“吞并”中国的这个地区或那个地区了。这项文件的作者，专心一意地避免使用艾奇逊那样随心所欲地耍弄的字句。但为要弥补这个缺陷，这个文件的作者企图偷偷地引进更加掩蔽的中伤与诽谤。不过他们在这件事上，也并不比艾奇逊成功些。
    维克托洛夫继续说：从神话里，我们知道：众神如要惩罚某人，必先使之发疯。美国国务院所策划的“解释性文件”的作者们，正是这样情形。在举世都知道苏中谈判正在莫斯科举行，中国方面参加的有中华人民共和国中央人民政府主席，中华人民共和国政务院总理，以及东北人民政府与新疆省政府代表的时候，这些作者们却谈起苏联与新疆间的某种特殊关系，谈起苏联与中国某数区域之间的某种“个别”谈判。美国国务院为了“解释”和“支持”艾奇逊的声明而发表的文件的完全破产，是万分明显的。
    艾奇逊在他的一月十二日演说里凭借毒恶的反苏叫嚣，来掩盖他的对华政策的完全失败。他已遭到失败。他的第二次失败，便是国务院发表的“解释性文件”。维克托洛夫结论说：继续这种政策，只能招致新的失败。这些新的失败是无法用国务院的任何“背景文件”来防止的。文件如果是根据对事实的恶意歪曲和污蔑中伤，那就更不能避免失败了。
