　　Hebei Production Inspection Initially Concluded
    Provincial Factories and Mines See Large Output Increases
    Worker Welfare Improved, and Production Enthusiasm Rises
    [This newspaper reports] The large-scale inspection of provincial factories and mines in Hebei Province, which began in December and lasted for a month and a half, has initially come to an end. After this inspection, the leadership of various factories and mines paid more attention to improving employee benefits and safety equipment, the unity among employees was generally further strengthened, workers' enthusiasm for production increased, and output increased significantly. In the past, the Handan Fuchang Flour Mill had some disunity among its employees, but since this inspection, the relationship between employees has improved significantly. In the past, due to the aging engine, the production volume dropped from 900 bags per day to about 700 bags. Now, thanks to the increased enthusiasm of the workers and the modification of the expansion ring, production efficiency has been enhanced, and the output has returned to 900 bags. In the past, the Xinji Chemical Factory changed to a vertical furnace without consulting the workers properly, which delayed the process by ten days, resulting in a loss equivalent to 63,000 jin of rice. After the workers heard the factory director's and trade union's self-criticism during this inspection, they realized that the factory's losses were their own losses. They said, "Since the factory director has made a self-criticism, we must work hard!" The workers voluntarily proposed to make up for the past losses through active production and strict economy. Thanks to the workers' efforts, the vertical furnace experiment has been successful. This not only saves one-third to one-half of the coal every day, but also improves the output and quality compared to the past. In the past, one piece of crude alkali (400 jin of soda ash plus 200 jin of coal dust) produced 3.1 buckets of sodium sulfide, but now it has been increased to 3.3 buckets, and it may be increased to 3.5 buckets in the future. In the past, it took four days to wash a boiler at the Baoding Power Plant. Now, the old habits have been completely broken, and it only takes eight hours to wash a boiler. In the past, it took three firings and five tons of coal to wash the boiler for four days, and the mouth pad had to be replaced every time the boiler was washed. This time, the old ones were washed and reused, saving 1,000 jin of millet each time. After the inspection of the Shao Ming, Hu Yu, and Zhang Cun mines, the principle of relying on the working class to manage production was further clarified, and democracy was widely promoted. The workers of the Shao Ming Coal Mine put forward a total of 891 opinions to the trade union and the factory director, and the workers of Hu Yu put forward more than 200 opinions. Because of the sincerity and humility of each other when making suggestions, the unity of employees has greatly improved. Improvements have been made in workers' welfare, cultural and recreational activities. All three mines have established artificial broadcasting stations and workers' tabloids. All factories have paid attention to safety equipment such as fire prevention, theft prevention, and water prevention, and have begun to actively improve them. The workers' morale is exceptionally high, and production has increased rapidly. In the past, Zhangcun produced 290-300 tons of coal per day, but now it has increased to 375-384 tons. Shao Ming's daily coal production was 89-120 tons in the past, but now it has increased to 195-210 tons. In the past, Hu Yu's daily coal production was 180-190 tons, but now it has increased to 230-240 tons. An increased production plan for 1950 has been formulated. The total average output of the three mines will increase by 19.89% compared to 1949, and the Shao Ming Mine will increase by more than 51% compared to 1949.
    During this inspection, many problems were found in various factories and mines, mainly in the following two situations. One is that the accounts are chaotic and there is a lack of a strict economic accounting system. For example, when the warehouse keeper of Yihua Yarn Factory put raw materials into the warehouse, he was afraid that the weight would be insufficient when they were taken out of the warehouse after being weighed, so he deliberately counted the wrapping paper and ropes as materials. As a result, in more than half a year, more than 20,000 pounds of long-staple cotton were surplus. When the Gongyi Oil Factory put goods in the warehouse, it was afraid that the weighing would be damaged and it would be difficult to account for it, so it pre-deducted 1% to 1.5% of the damage from every 100 jin, which also resulted in a surplus of more than 1,800 jin. In the past, the Yonghua Chemical Factory relied on the number reported by the workers when making payments. It did not carefully check and study the damage of materials. When clearing the warehouse, it was short of 300,000 jin of saltpeter and 100,000 jin of soda ash. The Baoding Supply and Marketing Cooperative lacked inspection and once wetted 1,779 bags of flour. The other is that the phenomenon of extravagance and waste is quite serious, and there are phenomena such as embezzling public funds and not distinguishing between public and private interests. For example, Wang Xiaozhi, the deputy director of the business section of the Shijiazhuang Supply and Marketing Cooperative, pointed out in his self-criticism that he had privately lent 300,000 yuan of public funds to the Tuoye Battery Factory in December. When he was in the Yonghua Chemical Factory, he used public funds to lend to private merchants several times. The phenomenon of not turning in money to the treasury after selling goods in some stores and using IOUs to抵现金 still exists. The Tianjin Supply and Marketing Cooperative made a self-criticism for eating public oil at will, and the Baoding Supply and Marketing Cooperative made a self-criticism for using public funds to buy public flour for sale, and the money earned was considered as food savings. In order to correct these phenomena, the Industrial Corporation under the Provincial Department of Industry specially held an accounting conference, conducted a detailed self-criticism, emphasized strengthening the economic accounting system in various enterprises, and immediately began to clear warehouses and settle the accounts for 1949.

　　河北生产检查初步告一段落
    省营各厂矿产量大增
    工人福利得到改进生产情绪高涨
    【本报讯】河北省于十二月份开始对省营各厂矿进行大检查，历时月半，已初步告一段落。经过这次检查，各厂矿领导思想上对职工福利、安全设备等更加注意改进，职工间的团结普遍进一步加强，工人生产情绪提高，产量大增。邯郸复昌面粉厂，过去职工之间有些不团结，从这次检查后，职工关系有了显著改善。过去因引擎逾龄，生产量由日产九百袋降至七百袋左右，现在由于工人情绪提高，改造了涨圈，生产效率增强，又恢复了九百袋的产量。辛集化学厂过去改立式炉，因没有很好和工人商量，耽误十天，损失折米六万三千斤。这次工人听了厂长和工会的检讨，工人认识了工厂的损失就是自己的损失，他们说：“厂长检查了，咱们就得努力干！”工人自动提出要将过去的损失，从积极生产、厉行节约中弥补起来。由于工人的努力，已将立式锅炉试验成功了，这样不仅每天可节约三分之一到二分之一的炭，产量质量上也较过去提高。过去一块粗碱（四百斤曹达加二百斤煤末）出三·一桶硫化碱，现已提到三·三桶，今后可能提高到三·五桶。保定发电厂过去洗刷一次锅炉需用四天时间，现在完全打破了过去老一套的旧习惯，刷洗锅炉只用八小时。过去刷四天得生三次火用五吨煤，每次刷洗锅炉必须换一次口垫，这次将旧的洗了洗又用了，每次可节省小米一千斤。邵明、胡峪、章村三个矿经过检查后，进一步明确依靠工人阶级管理生产的方针，广泛的发扬了民主，邵明煤矿工人向工会及厂长共提了八百九十一条意见，胡峪工人提了二百多条意见。由于提意见时互相诚恳虚心，职工团结大有进步。在工人福利、文化娱乐方面都有了改进，三个矿都建立了人工广播台、工人小报，各厂对防火、防偷、防水等安全设备均已引起注意，并着手积极改善。工人情绪异常高涨，生产量突飞猛进。章村过去日产煤二九○——三○○吨，现已增至三七五——三八四吨；邵明日产煤八九——一二○吨，现已增至一九五——二一○吨；胡峪过去日产煤一八○——一九○吨，现已增至二三○——二四○吨。并已订出一九五○年增产计划，三个矿的总平均产量较一九四九年将增加百分之一九·八九，邵明矿较一九四九年将增产百分之五十一强。
    在这次检查中，发现各厂矿存在不少毛病，主要有以下两种情况，一种是账目紊乱，缺乏严格的经济核算制度，如益华纱厂保管员在原料入库时，怕因伤秤后出库时斤量不足，故意将包皮、绳子也算成材料，结果半年多的时间，长余了皮棉二万多磅。公益油厂入库时恐怕伤了秤不好交代，每百斤预先减除百分之一到百分之一·五的伤耗，也长余一千八百余斤。永华化学厂平时领支，单凭工人报数，不认真检查，不研究材料的伤耗，清库时短了皮硝三十万斤，曹达十万斤。保定供销处因缺乏检查，曾潮湿面粉一千七百七十九袋。另一种是铺张浪费现象相当严重，且有挪用公款，公私不分等现象，如石家庄供销处营业股副股长王晓之，在检讨时举出十二月份私将公款三十万元借与拓业电池厂。其在永华化学厂时曾有几次动用公款借与私商。有的门市部卖货后款不交库，以白条抵现金的现象还不断发生，天津供销处检讨出随便吃公家的油，保定供销处检讨出用公款买公家面出售，赚了钱算伙食节余。为纠正这些现象，省工业厅所属实业公司特别召开了一次会计会议，进行了详尽检讨，强调加强各企业中的经济核算制度，并即着手清理仓库，结算一九四九年账目。（张俊峰）
