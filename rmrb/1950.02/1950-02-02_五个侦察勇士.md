The Five Brave Scouts

　　On the evening of the 18th of last month, the soldiers of a reconnaissance company of a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army quietly crossed the Min River under the cover of darkness. Their mission was to gather information about the enemy's deployment, which meant capturing some prisoners to obtain reliable intelligence. Bai Dimi, the deputy platoon leader of the second platoon, led Zhou Jingshun, the deputy squad leader of the sixth squad, and soldiers Wan Maizhong, Song Misheng, and Jiang Yingqing, searching forward along the Min River, 500 meters ahead of the company. At this time, a drizzle was falling, and the river flowed quietly. Nothing could be seen except for the vaguely discernible trees. After walking for more than half a mile, a shout suddenly came: "Who's there! Stop!" The five warriors immediately spotted several dark figures in front of them and pounced on them, capturing six enemy soldiers in one fell swoop. It turned out that they were sentries guarding the ferry. From them, they learned that a large contingent of enemies was stationed in Pengshan County, five miles from the riverbank. Thus, after confiscating the guns of the six enemy soldiers, the five warriors immediately searched forward again in a northwest direction. The dark field appeared desolate. They walked through paddy fields, grassy depressions, slopes, and bamboo forests, and after walking more than three miles along a small path, they spotted flickering lights ahead. After a while, they vaguely saw the shadow of a tall city wall. At this time, they were at most half a mile from the South Gate of Pengshan County. Deputy Platoon Leader Bai Dimi led the four soldiers quietly, tightly gripping their machine guns, and felt their way toward the lights. There was a tall whitewashed courtyard, and four figures were moving inside the house. The five warriors used a clump of bamboo as cover, intending to jump in front of the enemy, but they were discovered by the enemy as they passed through the bamboo. A shout immediately came from the front: "Which unit?" The five warriors immediately took cover. However, the enemy pressed on with their questioning, and one soldier said sternly: "The People's Liberation Army!" At this time, the enemy sentry shouted even more frantically: "Stop! Stop! What troops are you!" The five warriors shouted in unison: "The People's Liberation Army of Liu Bocheng has arrived!" While shouting, they rushed forward quickly. The enemy sentry was so frightened that he turned and ran. The enemies inside the house were also in a panic, trying to escape from the back of the house. However, the five warriors had already circled around to the back door. When the enemies ran out of the backyard gate, they shouted loudly to the enemies in the courtyard: "The Liberation Army is here, surrender your guns quickly!" "Surrender and live!" The enemies in the house were still agitated. Deputy Platoon Leader Bai Dimi immediately deployed the four soldiers to hold the backyard gate with their submachine guns. Fearing that the enemies would escape from the front, he cleverly gave a false order: "The third platoon, quickly set up machine guns to guard the front door, don't let a single enemy escape." The enemies in the house thought there was no way to escape, so they scrambled to shout: "We surrender, we surrender." They heard a chaotic crashing sound in the courtyard, and the enemies all dropped their guns on the ground. When counting the prisoners, it was discovered that it was actually a company of the 486th Regiment of the 36th Division of the scattered bandits' 65th Army, including more than 130 people from the deputy battalion commander and company commander down, who were all obediently taken prisoner by the five warriors.

　　五个侦察勇士
    上月十八日黄昏，解放军某部侦察连的战士们，趁着夜幕悄悄地渡过了岷江。他们的任务是搜集敌人布防的情况，也就是要捉几个俘虏，以便得到切实的情报。二排副白底秘，带领六班副周景顺、战士万麦种、宋米生、姜应青，在离开连队五百公尺的前面，沿着岷江搜索前进。这时天空下着蒙蒙的细雨，河水静静地流着，除了隐隐可辨的树丛什么也看不见，走了半里多路，突然传来一声吼声：“那一个！站住！”五位勇士马上发现前面有几个黑影，随即向那几个黑影猛扑过去，一下子就活捉了六个匪兵，原来是看守渡船的哨兵，从他们口里知道距江岸五里路的彭山县还住着大队的敌人。于是，五个勇士在缴了六个匪兵的枪后，马上又朝西北方向搜索前进。黑漆漆的田野显得一片荒凉。他们走过稻田、草洼、坡地和竹林，沿着小路走了三里多，发现前面火光闪闪，走了一会方又模糊地看见一座高大的城墙影子。这时距离彭山县南关最多只有半里多路了，副排长白底秘领着四个战士悄悄地紧握着机枪，朝火光方向摸过去。那里有一座高大的粉墙院子，屋子里有四个人影在恍动。五个勇士利用一丛竹林作隐蔽，企图跃到敌人跟前，可是他们在穿过竹丛时就给敌人发觉了。前面立刻传来喊声：“那一部分？”五个勇士立刻掩蔽起来。可是敌人追问的很紧，一个战士就厉声地说：“人民解放军！”这时敌哨更加惶乱地叫：“站住！站住！什么队伍呀！”五勇士一齐大吼一声：“人民解放军刘伯承的队伍来了！”一面喊，一面飞快地冲过去。敌哨兵吓得回头就跑，屋内的敌人也慌做一团，企图从屋后逃走。可是五勇士早已绕到后门来，等敌人跑出后院门，就向院子里的敌人大声喊道：“解放军来了，快些缴枪吧！”，“缴枪不杀！”屋里的敌人还在骚动。副排长白底秘即一面分布四个战士托着冲锋枪守住后院门；一面又恐怕敌人从前面逃跑，就机智地大声下了个假命令：“三排快架好机枪守着前门，不要让敌人逃跑一个。”屋里的敌人料想无路可逃，于是争先恐后地嚷着：“我们缴枪，我们缴枪。”只听见院子里哗啦哗啦一阵子乱响，敌人都把枪丢在地上了。当清点俘虏时，才发现原来是散匪六五军三六师四八六团一个连的兵力，包括副营长、连长以下一百三十多个，都乖乖地作了五个勇士的俘虏。    （新华社讯）
