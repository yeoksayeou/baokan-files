　　In the Shiwan Mountain area of Qin County, Fangcheng in Guangdong, and Shangsi and Sile in Guangxi, there are Yao, Pian, Miao, and other ethnic minorities. For thousands of years, they have been locked in the deep mountains, suffering persecution, insults, and bullying, living a life of pain. Every year at the beginning of winter, when the weather turns cold, trees wither, and heavy snow seals the mountains, they gather on the mountain peaks, cutting down large trees. After the trees dry out the following year, they set them on fire, leaving the ashes on the ground. Then, they turn over the ash-covered soil by hand (they have no cattle or farm tools), sowing alfalfa, corn, or planting taro and sweet potatoes. However, if there are several heavy rains in the summer, the soil is washed away, and they must replant using the same procedure. During the planting season, they toil in the soil from dawn till late at night, covered in black except for their eyes and teeth. When harvest time comes, they divide the harvested fruits equally according to the number of people participating in the collective labor. Cloth is extremely scarce in the mountains, and boys and girls under the age of thirteen can only stay at home and warm themselves by the fire, even in the harsh winter with heavy snow.

　　There are many bandits around the mountains, and with the connivance of the Kuomintang reactionaries, they often enter the mountains to plunder the fruits of their hard work—shiitake mushrooms, wood ear, honey, and grain. Sometimes, when they carry shiitake mushrooms, wood ear, honey, and the like down the mountain to sell, they have to go through one extortion after another before they can reach the trading market designated by the Kuomintang reactionary government, where they sell them at extremely low prices and exchange them for salt and cloth at high prices. The usurious loans of local bureaucratic bullies also invade the mountainous areas, even more cruelly sucking their marrow. The reactionary government also forced the Yao people to send their children to Guilin Normal School for "study" in order to cultivate henchmen.

　　When the Japanese invaders occupied Fangcheng, Shangsi, and other places, the local Chinese Communist Party led the people of all ethnic groups in the Shiwan Mountain area to organize armed forces and unite to resist Japan. Thus, the people of the Yao, Pian, and Miao ethnic groups began to embark on the path of liberation struggle. After Japan surrendered, the Kuomintang bandit gang dispatched three armies to "suppress" this people's armed force that had contributed to the war of resistance against Japan. After the Kuomintang bandit gang launched a full-scale civil war in July 1946, the bandit gang constantly attacked this people's armed force. In the struggle against the massacres, the people of all ethnic groups in the Shiwan Mountain area became increasingly united. Initially, the people of various ethnic minorities were somewhat skeptical of the people's armed forces led by the Communist Party due to long-term oppression by the reactionary great Han chauvinism, fearing that they were not of one mind with them. When the guerrillas mobilized them to rise up against the "three evils" (the Kuomintang bandit army and the minority Yi people who were exploited by the bandit army, the bandits who were condoned by the Kuomintang, and the wild animals that harmed crops), they were not very enthusiastic. Later, from various lessons and experiences, they realized that the bandit army, bandits, and wild animals were all common enemies of the people of all ethnic groups. As a result, the Yao, Miao, and Pian people established brotherly feelings with the Han people, enthusiastically supported the guerrillas, and actively participated in the fighting. When the guerrillas were short of food, many Yao people took out the grain they had buried in the ground.

　　Under the banner of Mao Zedong, ethnic minorities organized and developed their own armed forces, including Pian platoons, Miao platoons, and mixed Han, Yao, Pian, and Miao platoons. The Yao and Pian people, accustomed to climbing mountains and hunting, were excellent sharpshooters in pursuit battles. Some Yao people even became platoon leaders, something that had never happened in their history. They cheered, "Mountain people (referring to Yao people) can now be officials!" They were united like steel, and wherever they went in an ethnic area, they naturally took root there, having defeated the enemy's blockades and "suppressions" many times. The most difficult days were from September 1948 to February 1949, with incessant "suppressions" by the bandit army. Some of the guerrillas were forced to climb to the highest peak of the Shiwan Mountain, Fulong Pass, to build thatched huts to live in. Although it was a subtropical region, people still had to wear cotton clothes on the mountain in June. The enemy blockaded the food supply, and they could only rely on the masses to secretly send a little food up from the mountain, with each person only able to eat two or three ounces of rice a day. But the guerrillas were using this opportunity to consolidate their training. When they were completely out of food, they dug wild vegetables, shot wild birds, and caught frogs to cook and eat, and persisted in studying. Once, a platoon was blockaded by the enemy and went hungry for two days. The masses could not supply food in time. They received intelligence that the enemy was going to pass through their area, so they decided to seize the enemy's food. However, everyone was so hungry that they could not stand up, and only a dozen or so people could take up guns to ambush and intercept. Finally, they bravely and cleverly defeated an enemy battalion and seized a large amount of grain. They had no quilts and often sang around the fire in their thatched huts, passing the long winter nights. Once, during a march, they had to pass through a mountain top with no roads. Everyone took off their clothes and walked through the brambles. They only put on their pants when they were about to enter the village, because skin that was pricked could still grow back, but it was even more difficult to replace torn pants. But they never complained, and they often happily sang their self-composed songs: "Maple leaves are red, red and bright, Maple leaves all over the mountain are drunk in the autumn breeze, The autumn is high and the air is crisp, a good time for fighting, Guerrilla life is endlessly joyful, joyful and endlessly joyful!"

　　The arduous struggle of the Yao, Pian, and Miao people has finally achieved a victorious result. Now they are busy electing their own village chiefs and building their own government, thus forever ridding themselves of an oppressed life.

### 十万大山里少数民族的解放斗争

　　十万大山里少数民族的解放斗争
    在广东钦县防城和广西上思、思乐的十万大山里，有徭人、偏人、苗人等少数民族。数千年来他们被关锁在深山中，受着迫害、侮辱和欺凌，过着苦痛的岁月。每到天寒树凋大雪封山的初冬，他们聚集山头，砍伐大树，等到来年树木干透后便放火烧掉，让灰烬残留地上，然后用手将带灰的泥土翻过来（他们没有耕牛和农具），撒上苜蓿、玉蜀黍或是种上芋头、蕃薯。但若夏天下了几场大雨，泥土就被洗得精光，他们又必须用同样的手续另行栽种。耕种的季节，他们从天亮到深夜都在泥土中翻滚劳作，除了眼睛和牙齿外，一身漆黑。到了收获的日子，就按参加集体劳动的人数平分收获的果实。山中布匹极缺，十三岁以下的男女小孩，就是大雪纷纷的严冬，也只能光着身子在家里烤火。
    山周围的土匪很多，在国民党反动政府纵容下，经常进山来抢掠他们辛勤得来的果实——香菇、木耳、蜂蜜和粮食等。有时他们挑些香菇、木耳、蜂蜜之类下山去卖，要经过一处又一处的盘剥勒索，然后才能达到国民党反动政府指定的交易市场，以极贱价格卖出，而用高价换回盐和布。地方官僚土劣的高利贷也侵入山区，更凶残地吸着他们的膏血。反动政府还强迫徭人送子弟到桂林师范“留学”，以培植爪牙。
    日寇侵陷防城、上思等地时，当地的中国共产党就在十万大山领导各族人民组织武装，团结抗日，于是徭、偏、苗各族的人民开始走上了解放斗争的道路。日本投降后，国民党匪帮调了三个军来“扫荡”这支抗日有功的人民武装。一九四六年七月国民党匪帮发动全国内战后，匪帮更不断地进攻这支人民武装。在反对大屠杀的斗争中，十万大山里各族人民日益团结起来了。起初，各少数民族人民因长期受反动派大汉族主义的压迫，以致对共产党领导的人民武装也有些疑虑，怕和他们不一心。游击队发动他们起来反“三害”（国民党匪军和受匪军利用的少数夷人、受国民党纵容的土匪和伤害农作物的野兽）时，他们还并不起劲，后来从种种事实教训中，他们认识了匪军、土匪和野兽一样是各族人民的共同敌人。于是，徭、苗、偏人民与汉族人民建立了兄弟般的感情，一致热烈地支援游击队并踊跃参加战斗，当游击队粮食困难的时候，许多徭人把自己埋藏在地里的粮食拿出来。
    在毛泽东的旗帜下，少数民族组织并发展了自己的武装，有偏人连队，苗人连队，汉、徭、偏、苗的混合连队。徭、偏人民因惯于爬山打猎，在追击战中是很好的神枪手。徭人中且有当了排长的，这是他们历史上从来没有过的事。他们欢呼着：“山人（指徭人）现在也能当官啦！”他们彼此团结得像钢铁一样，他们无论走到那个民族区域，就很自然地在那里生了根，曾经战胜了敌人多次的封锁和扫荡。一九四八年九月到一九四九年二月是最艰苦的日子，匪军不绝的“扫荡”，一部分游击队被迫爬上十万大山的最高峰扶隆隘去搭茅草棚过生活，那里虽属亚热带地区，可是六月里山上还要穿棉衣。敌人把粮源封锁了，只有依靠群众偷偷地从山下送一点上来，一人一天只能吃到二、三两米。但游击队正利用这个机会来整训。在完全绝粮的时候，他们就挖野菜、打野鸟、捉青蛙来煮着吃，并坚持学习。有一次一个连队因被敌人封锁而饿了两天，群众的粮食接济不上，他们得到情报说敌人要经过他们那里，就下了决心夺取敌人粮食，可是大家饿得站不起来，只有十多个人能拿了枪去埋伏截击，终于英勇机智打垮了敌人一个营，夺得大批粮食。他们没有棉被，常常在茅棚里围火高歌，度过漫漫的冬夜。有一次行军要从没有路的山头通过，大家脱得赤条条地在荆棘丛中走，快进村庄才穿上裤，因为刺破了皮肤还可以长，裤子破了更难补充。可是他们从不叫苦，他们常常愉快地唱着自己编的歌：“枫叶红，红东东，满山枫叶醉秋风，秋高气爽好打仗，游击生活乐无穷，乐呀乐无穷！”
    徭、偏、苗人民艰苦的斗争，终于获得了胜利的结果，现在他们正在忙于选举自己的村长，建设自己的政权，从此永远摆脱被压迫的生活。
