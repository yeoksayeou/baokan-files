Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, February 22nd. In order to increase power generation and ensure safe power supply in 1950, the Central Ministry of Fuel Industry convened a national electricity conference in Beijing on the 19th. The conference was attended by 138 administrative cadres and technical personnel from the electricity management bureaus, electricity companies, and power plants of major administrative regions across the country, as well as representatives from relevant central departments. At the meeting, Chen Yu, Minister of the Ministry of Fuel Industry, reported on the summary of national electricity work in 1949 and the work guidelines and tasks for 1950. In his report, Minister Chen pointed out that in 1949, state-owned factories in Northeast China, North China, and East China basically ensured the supply of electricity for industrial use, completed the task of supporting the front lines, and also reduced losses and accidents, and improved machine efficiency. In terms of coal consumption: the average coal consumption per kilowatt-hour in North China's electricity industry in the second half of last year decreased by 19.1% compared to the first half of the year. The coal consumption of thermal power plants in Northeast China decreased by 19.2% in the second half of last year compared to the first half of the year, and the coal consumption rate of individual power plants has approached Soviet standards. In terms of loss rate of lines and self-used electricity: compared with the first half of last year, Northeast China reduced by 18.6%, and North China reduced by 16%. In terms of improving machine efficiency: individual units have also achieved remarkable results. For example, the power supply capacity of No. 3 furnace in Tianjin No. 1 Factory has doubled, and the power supply of Fushun Power Plant has increased by 30% after boiler repairs.

　　燃料工业部召开全国电业会议
    保证全年安全供电
    今年要准备二、三年内工业生产所需电源
    【新华社北京二十二日电】为提高发电量及保证一九五○年安全供电，中央燃料工业部特于十九日在京召开了全国电业会议。出席会议的有全国各大行政区工业部电业管理局、电业公司、发电厂的行政干部与技术人员及中央各有关部门列席代表共一百三十八人。会上燃料工业部部长陈郁报告了一九四九年全国电业工作总结和一九五○年的工作方针与任务。陈部长在报告中指出一九四九年东北、华北、华东各国营工厂基本上保证了工业用电的供应，完成了支援前线的任务，而且减少了损耗和事故，提高了机器效能。在煤耗方面：华北电业去年下半年平均每度电用煤比上半年减少了百分之一九．一。东北火力发电厂的煤耗去年下半年比上半年减少百分之一九．二，个别电厂煤耗率已接近苏联标准。在线路和自用电的损失率方面：去年下半年与上半年相比，东北减少百分之一八．六。华北减少百分之一六。在发挥机器效能方面：个别单位也有显著成绩。如天津一厂三号炉供电能力增加了一倍，抚顺电厂锅炉经修整后增加供电百分之三十。
