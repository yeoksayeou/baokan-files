　　Man Will Conquer Nature
　　By Our Correspondent Yongjin
　　A Visit to the Severely Affected Areas of Ninghe, Baodi, Yutian, and Ji County

　　We have difficulties, we have solutions, we have hope.
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　——Chairman Mao

　　Stepping into the Ice Zone
　　From Lutai on the edge of Bohai Bay northward to Ji County south of the Great Wall, more than ten rivers, including the Jiyun, Jian’gan, Qinglong, Kuangerjiang, and Jinzhong, flow through this area. Last summer and autumn brought excessive rainfall and flooding, bringing unprecedented disaster to more than 500,000 people in Ninghe, Baodi, Yutian, and Ji County.

　　In early February, this reporter followed Wu Xinyu, Deputy Minister of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Central People's Government, and Li Zheren, Director of the Research Office of the North China Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, into the ice zone of Ninghe, Baodi, Yutian, and Ji County. This area, about 400 li in circumference, was completely blocked by ice and snow. Everything in the fields was submerged. Looking into the distance, the villages resembled small islands in the ocean. Pedestrians and vehicles traveled entirely on the ice. Hunger and cold threatened the survival of more than 500,000 people.

　　The lives of the people in the ice zone are extremely difficult. Bran and vegetables have become their main food. The faces of the vast majority of people are sallow and emaciated, and their bodies are weak. In Xiaoluzhuang in Ninghe and Hulugou and Taxinwang villages in Baodi, more than 80 percent of the people eat pure bran and drink thin gruel.

　　In the supply and marketing cooperatives and in the grain exchanges of the market towns, the masses can only buy bran, vegetables, and small fish. Every market town is filled with tables, chairs, cabinets, beds, and clothes. We passed through many villages and saw people tearing down their houses to exchange for food. The masses in Shizhuang, Ninghe County, have torn down 149 houses and sold 75 percent of their livestock. The remaining livestock are mostly short, small, and weak, and some cannot even stand on their own. Wang Dianfu, secretary of the Changdian branch of the Communist Party of China, and his family of six have only one quilt left. Wang Mingyu, forced by hunger, sold his little girl, who was not yet ten years old.

　　Despite the severity of the disaster, social order in the affected areas remains as stable as in the past. The emergency relief grain and wheat seeds being transported to the affected areas are not escorted by armed guards, even on the long icy roads. In the market town of Huangzhuang, doors are still not locked at night. There is no looting or theft here. The people, long tempered under the education of the Communist Party, possess the noble quality of "poverty and meanness cannot be moved."

　　Support and Care
　　People's governments at all levels in the disaster areas, Party committees at all levels of the Communist Party of China, and the Party, government, army, and people in other liberated areas are supporting the people in the disaster areas with infinite care. The Central People's Government recently allocated more than 6 million catties of relief grain to rescue dying disaster victims, and lent more than 6 million catties of seeds for the disaster victims to sow. The Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Central People's Government specially sent Vice Minister Wu Xinyu, and the North China Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China sent Comrade Li Zheren to the disaster area to express their condolences and guide the work of production for self-relief. The Hebei Provincial People's Government issued an urgent instruction to all cadres to "treat disaster relief as fire fighting," organizing all forces and using all methods to fight to rescue disaster victims. Yang Xiufeng, Chairman of Hebei Province, also personally went to the disaster area to inspect, and the commissioners, local Party committees, county heads, and county Party committees in the disaster area personally went to the homes of the disaster victims to help them produce and overcome the famine.

　　Organizations, groups, and troops in the Jidong disaster area and the surrounding non-disaster areas have launched a vigorous "one liang of rice" and "one handful of rice" movement. Workers and people from all walks of life in Tangshan factories donated more than 40,000 catties of red grain and transported it to Yutian. Party members and cadres in Ninghe County have highly demonstrated the spirit of love and mutual assistance. Communist Party member Xu Kezhong is a first-class honorary soldier. He donated all of his pension grain and three months' subsidy rice to the disaster victims. Meng Qinglong, a farmers' association cadre in the fifth district of Yutian County, worked day and night to mobilize 36,000 catties of vegetables for the disaster victims. Fourteen old villagers from Lutai County who were transporting grain to the disaster area donated their travel expenses of 640 catties of millet for disaster relief.

　　Standing on high ground in the ice zone, one can see countless carts and horses pulling grain to the disaster area. People have forgotten the danger of falling into ice holes. The sound of ice carts, large carts, and cars never stops throughout the night. From cities to villages, from factories to schools, from Communist Party members to the masses, they are supporting the disaster victims from all directions.

　　The Masses, Cadres, and Communist Party Members Share Weal and Woe
　　In the ice zone, the local leading organs and the masses in the disaster areas live very hard lives. The provincial government secretary-general, commissioner, and county head stationed in the Ninghe County government to direct disaster relief work all eat the same sorghum rice, and the vegetables are small fish that are one inch or less in length.

　　When the disaster-stricken people feel disappointed, the Communist Party members and cadres encourage them. When the disaster victims feel that there is no way to produce, the Party members and cadres help them come up with concrete solutions to overcome the difficulties. I visited a dozen Communist Party members in Huangzhuang, District 3 of Ninghe. Some of them live even harder lives than the average people, but they are always at the forefront of the masses, leading them to fight against the disaster. Comrade Ma Yu, a branch committee member, has a swollen face because he eats too much bran, but he has never left his big gun that protects the villagers. He once went a whole day without even eating bran, and he still patrolled the village as usual at night. They have fought, are fighting, and will continue to fight together with the masses. They are always the outstanding sons of the working people.

　　Fighting Against Disaster and Severe Cold
　　The people of Ninghe, Baodi, Ji, and Yutian, who are in the midst of hunger and cold, have not succumbed to difficulties. They are resolutely fighting against nature. On the walls of many villages, you can see slogans such as: "Labor and Production Overcome the Disaster" and "Don't be afraid of floods, don't be afraid of droughts, just be afraid of lazy people who don't move." On the road from Lutai to the disaster area, we encountered many fishing teams. Behind Huangzhuang Town, close to the ice mountain, we saw the fishing team led by Li Qing, the secretary of the Communist Party branch. This team has more than 40 people. Five or six people use ice drills to open ice holes, and others put the fishing nets on the ice carts down. When the fishing net is pulled out of the water, someone must crawl on the ice and stretch his arm into the water hole to close the fishing net so that the fish will not escape. In the bitter cold, we saw the fishermen taking out bran cakes from their pockets to eat, and eating ice when they were thirsty. We saw several such fishing teams. Some of them catch more than 300 catties in one net, and most can catch more than 100 catties. Assuming an average of 150 catties per net, it can be exchanged for 200 catties of red grain (this fishing method is the most difficult, and at most four nets can be caught per day). Fishing in the ice zone is the most common activity. In Ninghe County alone, there are more than 7,000 fishermen, with a total daily output of about 35,000 catties. The sales of fish are very good this year. There are always many fishmongers following behind the fishermen. The fish can be sold out immediately after they are caught.

　　In addition to fishing, these counties are also developing weaving, mat making, and transportation. In the fifth and eleventh districts of Yutian, more than 1,700 bolts of cloth can be produced every day. The disaster area of Ji County has mobilized 2,000 spinning wheels, spinning more than 600 catties of thread every day, which can sustain the lives of more than 10,000 people. Forty-nine villages in Ninghe County have also started weaving, spinning 300 catties of thread every day. The fourth branch of the supply and marketing cooperative in Ninghe County once received 80 catties of thread in one day. According to their calculations, Yutian County requires the completion of 300,000 bolts of cloth from January to May, and 250,000 mats can be collected by the end of April (more than 30,000 pieces have already been received in January). When the flood occurred last year, the masses in Yangjiabanqiao, Yutian County, were once pessimistic and disappointed. The Communist Party branch and Communist Party members in this village immediately mobilized more than 200 people in the village to make baffles for fishing. When the famine enveloped Yangjiabanqiao, Communist Party member Yang Wenkui donated his nine mu of reeds to the masses for making baffles and weaving mats, thus exchanging them for 50,000 catties of corn in two months. The masses said: "If it weren't for the leadership of the branch and Party members, there would be no way to survive this year!" Of course, there are still many difficulties facing the people in the disaster area, and arduous efforts must be made. However, as long as the policy of production for self-relief is resolutely implemented, the famine can definitely be overcome.

    宁、宝、玉、蓟重灾区访问记
    我们是有困难的，有办法的，有希望的。
                              ——毛主席语
    踏进冰区
    从渤海湾边的芦台往北，到长城以南的蓟县，这里有蓟运、箭杆、青龙、匡尔江、金钟等十余条河穿流着。去年夏秋雨多水大，水灾给宁河、宝坻、玉田、蓟县五十余万人民带来了空前未有的灾难。
    记者于二月初旬，随中央人民政府内务部武新宇副部长、中共中央华北局研究室李哲人主任进入宁、宝、玉、蓟冰区。这块周围四百余里的地区，完全被冰雪封锁着。田野间的一切都被淹没了。遥望远处村庄，如海洋中的小岛。行人车马完全走在冰上。饥饿和严寒威胁着五十余万人民的生存。
    冰区人民的生活是极端困难的。糠秕、菜蔬成为他们最主要的食品。绝大多数人的面孔都是青黄而消瘦，身体羸弱不堪。宁河的小芦庄，宝坻的葫芦沽、塔辛汪等村人民吃纯糠喝糊糊者占百分之八十以上。
    在供销社里，在集镇的粮食交易所中，群众能购买的只有糠菜和小鱼了。每个集镇上都充斥着桌、椅、柜、床和衣服等物。我们走过不少村庄，看见有人拆掉房子换粮食。宁河县石庄群众已拆掉房子一四九间，卖掉牲口百分之七十五，剩下来的牲口多是矮小瘦弱，甚至自己都站不起来了。中共常店支部书记王殿付一家六口人剩了一条被子。王明宇迫于饥饿，而将自己不到十岁的小姑娘卖掉了。
    尽管灾情这样严重，灾区的社会秩序还是像过去一样的安定。运往灾区的急赈粮和麦种，在长远的冰路上行走时，并没有一个武装押送。在黄庄这个集镇上，仍然是夜不闭户。这里没有抢掠，没有偷盗。在共产党教育下的久经锻炼的人民，具有高贵的“贫贱不能移”的品质。
    支援与关怀
    灾区各级人民政府，中共各级党委和其他解放区的党政军民，都以无限的关怀支援着灾区的人民。中央人民政府最近又拨了赈粮六百余万斤，急救垂危的灾民，并贷下种籽六百余万斤，以备灾民下种之用。中央人民政府内务部特派武新宇副部长，中共中央华北局派李哲人同志前往灾区慰问并指导生产自救工作。河北省人民政府向全体干部发出“救灾如救火”的紧急指示，组织一切力量，运用一切方法，为抢救灾胞而奋斗。河北省杨秀峰主席也亲到灾区视察，灾区的专员、中共地委、县长、中共县委都亲自到灾民家中帮助他们生产渡荒。
    冀东灾区和其周围非灾区中的机关团体和部队，开展了如火如荼的“一两米”“一把米”运动，唐山工厂工人及各界人民捐助红粮四万余斤，运往玉田。宁河县的党员、干部都高度的发扬了友爱互助精神。共产党员徐克忠是一等荣誉军人，他把自己的抚恤粮和三个月的津贴米，全部捐助灾民。玉田县五区的农会干部孟庆隆昼夜工作，给灾民动员三万六千斤菜。有十四个往灾区运粮的芦台县的老乡，把六百四十斤小米的路费都救灾了。
    站在冰区的高处，可以看见无数车马，拉着粮食往灾区运送。人们忘记了陷进冰窟的危险。冰车声、大车声、汽车声彻夜不绝。从城市到乡村，从工厂到学校，从共产党员到群众，正从四面八方支援灾民。
    群众、干部、共产党员甘苦与共
    在冰区，地方领导机关和灾区群众的生活，都是很艰苦的。驻宁河县政府指挥救灾工作的省府秘书长、专员、县长都吃同样的高粱米，菜是一寸或不到一寸长的小鱼。
    当灾难的人民感到失望的时候，共产党员、干部就鼓舞他们。当灾民感到生产上没有办法时，党员和干部就帮助他们想出解决困难的具体办法。我在宁河三区黄庄访问了十几个共产党员，他们中有的比一般群众生活还苦一些；但他们却是站在群众的前头，领导群众向灾难斗争。支部委员马玉同志的脸因为吃糠过多而虚肿了，但是他始终没有离开他那枝保卫村民的大枪。他曾有整整一天连糠都没有吃到，在夜里还是照常的在村上巡逻，他们在过去、现在和将来都是和群众一起战斗着，他们始终是劳动人民优秀的儿子。
    向灾难严寒作斗争
    处在饥饿严寒中的宁、宝、蓟、玉人民，他们并没有向困难屈服，他们和大自然进行着坚决的斗争。在不少村庄的墙上可以看到：“劳动生产渡过灾荒”“不怕涝，不怕旱，就怕懒汉不动弹”的标语。我们从芦台到灾区的路上，碰到不少的打鱼班子。在黄庄镇后面紧靠着冰山的地方，我们见到中共支部书记李清所率领的打鱼班。这个班共有四十多个人。有五六个人用冰钻打开冰眼，别人将冰车上的鱼网下进去。等到鱼网拉出水来的时候，必须有一个人匍在冰上，将胳臂伸进水窟中将鱼网合起，才能使鱼不致漏网。在严寒中，我们看到拉鱼的人从怀里掏出糠秕饼子吃，渴了吃点冰块。我们看到几个这样的捕鱼班子。他们有的一网捕三百多斤，大半能捕一百多斤。每网按一百五十斤算，可换二百斤红粮（这种捕鱼方式最为艰苦，每天顶多可捕四网）。在冰区中捕鱼是最普遍的，仅宁河一县即有七千余人捕鱼，每天总产量为三万五千斤左右；今年鱼的销路是很好的，在拉鱼的人们后面总是跟着不少的鱼贩，鱼一打出来马上就可卖完。
    除捕鱼外，这几个县正在开展着纺织、编席和运输等。在玉田的五区及十一区，每天可出布一千七百余匹。蓟县灾区已动员了两千辆纺车，每天纺线六百余斤，可维持万余人的生活。宁河县亦有四十九个村庄搞起纺织，每天可纺三百斤线。宁河县供销社第四分社一天曾收线八十斤。根据他们的计算，玉田县要求从一月至五月完成三十万匹布，到四月底可收席二十五万片（一月份已经收到三万余片）。当去年发水的时候，玉田县杨家板桥的群众曾经悲观失望，这村的中共支部、共产党员马上发动全村二百余人打箔捕鱼。当灾荒笼罩着杨家板桥时，共产党员杨文奎将自己的九亩苇子献给群众打箔、编席，因此，两个月换回五万斤玉米。群众说：“要不是支部、党员领导，今年就再也没办法了！”自然摆在灾区人民面前的还有重重的困难，还须作艰苦的努力，但是只要坚决实行生产自救的方针，灾荒一定可以克服的。
