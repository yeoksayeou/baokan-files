　　Former American Reporter and Japanese Medical Officer Confirm:
    Japanese Imperialists Used Bacteriological and Chemical Weapons
    Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, February 25th: According to Agence France-Presse, New York: Former American war correspondent Mr. Young delivered a speech at a banquet of the American Red Cross on the 20th, confirming that the Japanese army had manufactured and used bacteriological and chemical weapons on a large scale. Mr. Young refuted the U.S. State Department's statement denying that the Japanese army had used bacteriological weapons. Mr. Young said that he himself had witnessed patients in Chongqing hospitals during the war who had been poisoned by bacteria and poison gas spread by Japanese aircraft. In his speech, Mr. Young emphasized that the burns and permanent illnesses suffered by the residents of Hiroshima in August 1945 were not due to the atomic bomb explosion, but to the explosion of a kind of mustard gas stored in Hiroshima by the Japanese High Command. Japan had stored a large amount of mustard gas, of which 14,000 tons had been discovered by the United States and had not yet been used.
    According to the Dentsu News Agency, Tokyo, February 20th: Mr. Nakanishi Yoshio, a former Japanese lower-ranking medical officer currently living near Kyoto, published a statement in the Akahata newspaper confirming that the Japanese army had set up a bacteriological warfare unit in Nanjing, just like the one in Manchuria. When Nakanishi was serving in a Japanese army medical team at Jinling University in Nanjing, he had contact with personnel from the so-called "Central China Disease Prevention and Water Supply Unit." These personnel later told Nakanishi that the work of the unit was to cultivate and spread disease-causing bacteria, and that they had also used Chinese people for experiments. In August 1945, according to the orders of the Japanese High Command, they completely destroyed a building that manufactured bacteriological weapons in order to cover up the traces.

　　前美国记者和日本医官证实
    日寇曾使用细菌和毒气武器
    【新华社北京二十五日电】据法新社纽约讯：前美国战地记者杨氏二十日在美国红十字会的宴会上发表演说，证实日军曾大量制造并使用细菌和毒气武器。杨氏驳斥美国国务院否认日军曾使用细菌武器的声明。杨氏说：他本人战时曾在重庆医院目睹中了日本飞机所散布的细菌及毒气的毒的病人。杨氏在演说中强调指出：日本广岛居民在一九四五年八月所患的火伤和永久性的疾病，并非由于原子弹的爆炸，而是由于日本高级统帅部储藏在广岛的毒气中的一种的芥子气的爆炸。日本曾储备大量芥子气，仅经美国发现尚未动用的就有一万四千吨之多。
    另据电通社东京二十日讯：现住京都附近的前日本下级医官中西义雄在赤旗报发表声明，证实日军曾在南京设驻一支和在满洲一样的细菌战部队。中西在驻在南京金陵大学内一个日本陆军医疗队服务时，曾与所谓“华中疾病预防和给水供应部队”的人员交往。这些人员后来告诉中西说：该部队的工作是从事培养传布疾病的细菌，他们还曾用中国人作实验。一九四五年八月，他们根据日本统帅部的命令，将制造细菌武器的一所大楼完全摧毁，以便灭迹。
