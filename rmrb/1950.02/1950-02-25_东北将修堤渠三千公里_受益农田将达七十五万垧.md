[Northeast News] This year, Northeast China plans to construct over 3,000 kilometers of dikes, canals, and water conservancy projects, ensuring benefits for 750,000 hectares of land. This plan was determined at the Second Northeast Water Conservancy Conference held on the 16th of last month. This year, Northeast China plans to construct 20 major water conservancy projects. Among them, 14 are water management and irrigation projects belonging to the Liao River system, and four belong to the Songhua River system. In addition, there is the construction of the Hunchun irrigation project and hydrological station in Jilin Province. In total, over 600 kilometers of new river dikes need to be built (plus over 800 kilometers in Inner Mongolia), over 1,300 kilometers of river dikes need to be repaired, over 350 kilometers of drainage canals need to be dug, and over 3,000 kilometers of river courses need to be diverted and dredged. 477 new gates, bridges, and other structures will be built, and five will be repaired. It is estimated that over 15 million workers will participate in water conservancy construction this year. The planned investment in flood control projects is over 65,000 tons of grain, and over 58,000 tons in irrigation projects. According to last year's experience, the flood control effect is still very significant, and it is planned to invest 3,000 tons of grain in flood control this year. After the completion of the above projects, the total area of ​​farmland benefiting in Northeast China will reach more than 750,000 hectares, the area of ​​paddy fields can be increased by more than 27,000 hectares, and a foundation will be laid for long-term water conservancy construction. It is planned that 391 water stations will be completed in Northeast China within three years, of which 104 have already been completed last year, and 174 are planned to be completed this year.
