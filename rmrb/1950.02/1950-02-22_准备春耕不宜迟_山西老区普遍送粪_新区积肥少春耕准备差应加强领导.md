Spring plowing preparation should not be delayed.
    Shanxi old areas universally deliver manure.
    New areas have little accumulated fertilizer and poor spring plowing preparation. Leadership should be strengthened.
    [This newspaper's Shanxi dispatch] The current spring plowing preparation work in Shanxi Province has entered the manure transportation stage. In addition to accumulating fertilizer, accumulating fuel, repairing agricultural implements, building water conservancy projects, and rectifying preferential treatment for military families and land cultivation on their behalf, various localities have also grasped the characteristics of this year's short spring and further paid attention to livestock epidemic prevention, checking fertilizer accumulation, and mobilizing manure transportation. In terms of fertilizer accumulation, all special districts in the province have nearly completed their fertilizer accumulation plans, with Changzhi Special District averaging over 81% of the fertilizer application plan. After a general inspection, the masses are being mobilized to continue accumulating fertilizer in weak areas to strive for balance. Yuncheng Special District is actively delivering manure according to the habit of "three carts of manure per mu, fertilizing every two out of three years" in the plains area. To complete the plan, the special commissioner's office has dispatched working groups to Anyi, Wenxi and other counties to conduct inspections and promote the work. In addition to mobilizing the masses to accumulate fertilizer in conjunction with the year-end cleanup, Xin County Special District attaches particular importance to mobilizing people in the plains to buy soybean cakes and people in the mountainous areas to cut oak branches for burning into fertilizer. In addition to continuing to accumulate large amounts of fertilizer, various localities are also mobilizing the masses to transport manure to the fields under the slogan of "take the first step, stay ahead in every step." At present, old areas have been transporting manure to the fields in large quantities, and new areas have also begun to transport manure. Technical guidance has been given during the manure transportation process. For example, Changzhi County universally advocates turning over fertilizer and watering the privy, covering the manure with soil after it is transported to the field, and piling it in shady places to maintain its effectiveness. Xin County Special District convened experienced old farmers to study fertilization techniques, and some counties have formed a movement of turning over fertilizer, delivering fertilizer, and preserving fertilizer. In terms of preferential treatment for military families and land cultivation on their behalf, each special commissioner's office and county district has conducted inspections in accordance with the spirit of the "Instructions on Inspecting the Work of Preferential Treatment for Military Families and Land Cultivation on their Behalf" issued by the provincial government, and formulated a 1950 land cultivation plan based on specific circumstances. The content of the land cultivation inspection in Changzhi, Xin County and other special districts mainly focuses on checking how well the military families are prepared with fertilizer, fuel, seeds, etc., so as to provide more specific assistance to military families in spring plowing. In terms of livestock breeding, each special county has convened meetings of veterinarians and breeding experts or short-term training courses to increase livestock and prevent or reduce livestock deaths. At the same time, the provincial government has dispatched technical personnel to participate in the meetings in various special districts and help carry out this work. The Provincial Veterinary Prevention and Treatment Institute is also manufacturing anthrax serum vaccines and is preparing to inject vaccines to protect the health of 200,000 head of livestock in the province. In terms of water conservancy, according to statistics from eight counties in Changzhi Special District alone, 32 irrigation canals have been repaired, 102 waterwheels have been installed, and 409 wells have been dug. Within a month after the provincial water conservancy conference, 60,000 mu of land was irrigated. At present, 750,000 mu of land has been winter-irrigated throughout the province, accounting for 25% of the planned one million mu of winter-irrigated land. The main problems existing in the current spring plowing preparation work are that new areas have little accumulated fertilizer and insufficient spring plowing preparation. In the future, special attention should be paid to the leadership of new areas, mobilizing the masses in new areas to work hard to accumulate fertilizer, and learning from the experience of the masses in old areas in accumulating fertilizer. Give full play to the strength of cooperatives to help members of the community buy bean cakes and oil cakes to supplement fertilizer. And call on the masses to take immediate action to transport manure early, striving to transport most of it to the fields before the vernal equinox to prepare for spring plowing.

　　准备春耕不宜迟
    山西老区普遍送粪
    新区积肥少春耕准备差应加强领导
    【本报山西讯】山西省目前的春耕准备工作，已进入运粪阶段。各地除积肥、积燃、修置农具、兴修水利、整顿优军代耕等工作外，又掌握住今年春短特点，进一步注意牲畜防疫、检查积肥、发动运肥等工作。在积肥方面，现全省各专区已接近完成积肥计划，长治专区平均达到施肥计划的百分之八十一强。目前经过普遍检查后，正面向薄弱地区继续发动群众积肥，以争取平衡。运城专区根据平原地区“一亩三车粪、三年两头上”的习惯积极送粪。为完成计划，该专署又分派工作组到安邑、闻喜等县进行检查推动。忻县专区除发动群众结合年关扫除积肥外，特别重视发动平地群众买豆饼，山地群众割杚梢烧粪。各地除继续大量积肥外，又在“一步走在头，步步在前头”的口号下，发动群众往地送粪。现老区已大批往地运粪，新区亦已开始运粪。并在运粪中注意了技术指导。如长治各县普遍提倡翻肥浇圊，把粪运到地里用土盖好，并堆在背阴处以保持肥效。忻县专区召集有经验老农研究施肥技术，有些县已形成翻肥、送肥、保肥运动。在优军代耕方面，各专署及县区均依照该省省府发出的“检查优军代耕工作指示”精神进行了检查，并根据具体情况订出一九五零年的代耕计划。长治、忻县等专区检查代耕工作内容，主要是看军属的肥料、燃料、种子等准备的如何，以便更具体帮助军属春耕。在繁殖牲畜方面，各专县为了增殖牲畜与防止、减少牲畜病亡，都先后召开兽医配种行家等会议或短期训练班。同时该省府又派技术人员分头到各专区参加会议，帮助进行这一工作。该省兽医防治所也正在制造气瞳疽血清疫苗，准备为全省二十万头牲口注射防疫苗，以保护牲口健壮。在水利方面，仅长治专区八个县统计，已修水渠三十二条，安置水车一百零二部，打水井四百零九眼。省水利会议后一个月，即灌溉地六万亩。现全省已冬浇地七十五万亩，占冬浇地百万亩计划的百分之二十五。目前春耕准备工作存在的问题，主要是新区积肥少，春耕准备不足。今后要特别看重对新区的领导，发动新区群众努力积肥，学习老区群众的积肥经验。充分发挥合作社力量帮助社员群众购买豆饼油饼，补充肥料。并号召群众立即行动起来提早送粪，争取于春分前大部运到地内，准备进行春耕。（山西农业厅）
