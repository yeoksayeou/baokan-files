　　Praising the Establishment of Diplomatic Relations between China, the Soviet Union, and Vietnam
　　French Communist Party Politburo Issues Statement
    【Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, February 6th】TASS, Paris, February 5th: The French newspaper "L'Humanité" published a statement by the Politburo of the French Communist Party, praising the recognition of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam by China, the Soviet Union, and the people's democratic countries as a great embodiment of the policy of understanding and respecting the legitimate aspirations of all peoples for freedom and national independence. The statement said that now, as war preparations are becoming more intense, colonialists eager to obtain profits want to control the people of the colonies at all costs in order to restore colonial rule and oppression, thereby stabilizing the rear and preparing for an anti-Soviet war of aggression. The French Communist Party is determined to support the people who oppose the colonial regime and fight for the cause of peace. The statement concluded that only a democratic and peace-loving policy can win the trust of millions of men and women in France, and nothing can stop the people's progress towards freedom.
