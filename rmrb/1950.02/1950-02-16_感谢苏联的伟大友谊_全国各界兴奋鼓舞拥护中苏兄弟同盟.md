　　Thanking the Great Friendship of the Soviet Union
　　People from All Walks of Life Across the Country are Excited, Encouraged, and Support the Brotherly Sino-Soviet Alliance

　　Historically speaking, the Soviet Union has always been a true friend to our country. After the success of the Soviet October Revolution, it immediately abolished the unequal treaties in China. During the Anti-Japanese War, the Soviet Union provided us with unconditional assistance and loans. When our people's great revolution achieved victory, the Soviet Union established diplomatic relations with us the day after the founding of the People's Republic of China. Now, at a time when our people across the country are working hard to build the country, the Soviet Union, with its great and sincere friendship, has signed the Treaty of Friendship, Alliance, and Mutual Assistance with us, as well as agreements on the Chinese Changchun Railway, Lushunkou, Dalian, and a loan agreement. It has given us great assistance in all aspects, which makes us grateful beyond description.

　　The signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance, and Mutual Assistance is a great encouragement to our revolution. This treaty not only has a great stabilizing effect on peace in the Far East, but it will also play an extremely significant role in world peace. On the other hand, the publication of the Sino-Soviet treaty has thoroughly defeated the imperialists' rumors and provocations. Our people deeply understand the great friendship of the Soviet Union towards us. There are still a small number of people who do not understand this point and have doubts about the Sino-Changchun Railway, Lushunkou, Dalian, and other issues. The current agreement stipulates that the Sino-Changchun Railway and Lushunkou will be returned to China after the signing of a peace treaty with Japan, but no later than the end of 1952. In this way, even those very few people will clearly see the brotherly friendship of the Soviet Union towards us.

　　The US$300 million loan demonstrates the Soviet Union's deep concern for our country's construction. Its low interest rate is unprecedented in the history of foreign loans to China.

　　The signing of the Sino-Soviet treaty has ushered Sino-Soviet friendly relations into a new era. We should thank the leader of humanity worldwide, Marshal Stalin, and especially the brilliant leadership of the great leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao Zedong.

　　感谢苏联的伟大友谊
    全国各界兴奋鼓舞拥护中苏兄弟同盟
    许德珩
    从历史上来说，苏联一向是我国真正的友邦。当苏联十月革命成功之后，立即废除了在中国的不平等条约。抗日战争中，苏联给予了我们以无条件的援助。并给我国以贷款。当我国人民大革命取得胜利，中华人民共和国成立的第二天，苏联就和我们建立了邦交。现在，正值我全国人民辛勤建国的时期，苏联又以其伟大至诚的友谊，与我们签订了友好同盟互助条约，关于中国长春铁路及旅顺口、大连的协定和贷款协定。从各方面给我们以伟大的援助，这使我们感激到难以形容的地步。
    中苏友好同盟互助条约的签订，对我国革命是一极大鼓励。这一条约不仅对远东和平有其极大的安定作用，而且对世界和平也将起极其巨大的作用。另一方面，中苏条约的公布，使帝国主义者的造谣挑拨遭受了彻底的失败。我国人民是深切了解苏联对于我们的伟大友情的。还有很少一部分人不了解这一点，而对于中长铁路，旅顺口、大连等问题有所怀疑。这次协定中规定中长铁路、旅顺口将在对日和约签订之后，至迟不超过一九五二年年末归还中国。这样，即使是那部分极少数的人，也会清楚地看到苏联对我们兄弟般的友谊了。
    三亿美元的贷款，表示了苏联对我国建设事业的深切关怀。它的利息的低微，是历史上各国对华贷款未曾有过的。
    中苏条约的签订，使中苏友好关系进入了一个崭新的时代，我们应当感谢世界人类领袖斯大林大元帅，尤其应当感谢中国人民伟大领袖毛泽东主席的英明领导。
