The Editorial Board's Self-Criticism Regarding the "Ideological Nature of Street Poetry and Art" Manuscript

On January 17th, this publication made a serious error in publishing the article "The Ideological Nature of Street Poetry and Art." The fact is that the poems and paintings criticized in the article did *not* "appear" on the "streets of Shijiazhuang." The truth is this:

The original manuscripts of these poems and paintings were submitted by various units of the North China Military and Political University in Shijiazhuang to the school's political department for review. The review revealed inappropriate content, and therefore they were not posted. The political department compiled these materials into an internal bulletin, "instructing all subordinate units to pay closer attention during the review process and in future propaganda work." Comrade Yang Xin rewrote this internal bulletin and sent it in.

Given these facts, our handling of this manuscript was completely wrong. The words in the editor's note, such as "We hope the organs responsible for propaganda work in Shijiazhuang will conduct a public self-criticism," are therefore baseless.

The cause of this error, aside from the fact that Comrade Yang Xin's submission did not clearly explain the full facts, is mainly due to our lack of a sense of responsibility and seriousness in our work; we handled the manuscript based on "wishful thinking." Because the original text of the first paragraph of the submission was:

"In the first New Year of the people's victory, many units are rushing to produce street poetry and art to conduct widespread mass propaganda work."

When processing this manuscript, we felt that the location was not specified, and the phrase "many units..." was too broad, easily leading people to view a local phenomenon as a widespread one. Therefore, based on "December 27th in Shimen" at the end of the manuscript and the author's mailing address, we added "Shijiazhuang" at the beginning of the article. Changing "many units" in a school in Shijiazhuang to the city of Shijiazhuang was already a mistake; but the bigger mistake was that we also changed "are rushing to produce" to "appeared," which is completely inconsistent with the facts.

Clearly, if we had sufficient political responsibility and a serious work style, we could not have failed to consider that "are rushing to produce" is not the same as having already "appeared"; even though the manuscript was written in Shijiazhuang, it was not necessarily about Shijiazhuang. Upon receiving such an unclear manuscript, we should have written to the author to inquire about the details and should not have been so presumptuous in revising it and publishing it so carelessly.

Because we made this mistake, we sincerely apologize to the organs responsible for propaganda work in Shijiazhuang and to our readers. We will definitely strengthen our sense of responsibility in our editorial work in the future to ensure that such errors do not appear again in the valuable pages of the People's Daily.

### 本刊编者对于  “街头诗画的思想性”一稿的检讨

　　本刊编者对于
    “街头诗画的思想性”一稿的检讨
    一月十七日本刊在发表“街头诗画的思想性”一文时，犯了一个严重的错误。事实上“石家庄街头”并没有“出现”文中所批评的这些诗和画。事实是这样的：
    这些诗和画的原稿是石家庄华北军政大学的各单位送到该校政治部审查的，审查时即被发觉有不适当的地方，因而并未张贴。政治部把这些材料整理为内部通报。“责成所属各单位注意，今后在审稿过程及宣传工作中，更加提起警惕。”杨新同志就把这个内部通报改写寄来。
    事实既是如此，那末我们对这篇稿子的处理就完全错误了。在编者按语中“望石家庄负责宣传工作的机关作公开检讨”等语，就成为无的放矢了。
    这个错误的造成，除杨新同志的来稿有未把事实原委交代清楚之处这一缺点外，主要的原因是在于我们对工作的责任心与严肃性不够，“想当然”地处理稿件。因为来稿第一段的原文是：
    “人民胜利的第一个新年，很多单位都在赶制街头诗画，广泛地进行群众宣传工作。”
    我们处理这稿子时，感到没有写明什么地点以及“很多单位……”一语范围太广，易使人把局部的现象看成为普遍的现象，于是根据稿末的“十二月二十七日于石门”及作者通讯地址，就在文章开始的地方加上了一个石家庄。把石家庄一个学校的“很多单位”写成石家庄市，这已经是错了；但是更错的地方，却还是我们连带把“都在赶制”改成“出现了”，这就与事实完全不符了。
    显然，假如我们具有足够的政治责任感和严肃的工作作风，就不能不考虑到“都在赶制”并不等于已经“出现”；稿子虽是在石家庄写的，也并不一定就是写的石家庄的事情。我们接到这样不清楚的稿件，就应该写信向作者探询究竟，决不应该这样自作聪明地修改，并且这样轻率地发表。
    我们因为犯了这个错误，谨向石家庄负责宣传工作的机关和读者们承认错误。我们今后一定要在编辑工作中加强责任心，使这种错误不再出现在人民日报的宝贵的篇幅上。
