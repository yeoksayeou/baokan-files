　　The Vanguard of the People
　　——In Commemoration of the 32nd Anniversary of the Founding of the Soviet Army——
　　Guo Moruo
　　The Soviet army is invincible in the world. It has not only guaranteed the success of socialist construction in the Soviet Union alone, but also withstood the test of the Second World War, defeated the two most powerful fascist countries, Japan and Germany, in the East and West, and thus rescued peace-loving people all over the world. Today, it is indeed the strongest vanguard of world peace.

　　This is not only the army of the Soviet people, but also the army of the people of the whole world. Every year, progressive people all over the world celebrate the Soviet Army Day as if it were their own festival, and there is a reason for it.

　　The aim is to defend the peace of the people, so the people's armed forces must be strong. The result must be to gain the support of the people, and the people's armed forces will naturally be strong. The reason why the Soviet army is invincible lies here. This is a thorn in the side of the imperialists and also an object of armed competition for the imperialists, but we dare to say that this is impossible to compete with. This is the people's armed forces versus the anti-people's armed forces, the armed forces of peace versus the armed forces of aggression, the constructive armed forces versus the destructive armed forces, which cannot be compared in essence, just as a catty and two cannot be compared, and humans and apes cannot be compared.

　　But the Soviet army is not only progressive in essence, but also the highest in technology. Because the responsibility is great, the vigilance is strong. Imperialism itself is aggression, is war, and as the crisis of its demise gets closer, the danger of a cornered dog jumping over the wall becomes more apparent. The threat of war does exist at present. Therefore, commemorating the Soviet Army Day today increases its significance even more. We should strengthen and expand our peaceful armed forces to eliminate the aggressive war of anti-people imperialism.

　　We Chinese people are particularly excited to commemorate this festival this year. Our People's Liberation War has achieved great victory, the People's Republic of China with the people as the masters has been established, and recently the Soviet people have signed the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance with us. In times of peace, we have economic mutual assistance and cultural exchange, and in times of war, we have common hatred and fight side by side. We Chinese people and the Soviet people will always be united as one, and our Chinese people's armed forces and the Soviet people's armed forces will also always be united as one. Our peaceful armed forces have indeed been expanded and strengthened.

　　Let the imperialists tremble before this great peaceful force!

　　The people are irresistible, and the people's armed forces are irresistible! Whoever is willing to be an enemy of the people, an enemy of the people's armed forces, his fate will be the same as Hitler, Mussolini, and Tojo Hideki!

　　Long live the vanguard of the people, the heroic and unparalleled Soviet Army!

　　Long live the eternal friendship and eternal cooperation between China and the Soviet Union!

　　Long live lasting world peace and universal security!

　　人民的前卫
    ——纪念苏联第三十二届建军节——
　　郭沫若
    苏联的军队是无敌于世界的。他不仅保障了苏联在单独一国内社会主义建设的成功，而且经过了第二次世界大战的考验，击溃了东西两大兵力最强盛的法西斯国家——日本和德国，因而打救了全世界爱好和平的人民，在今天的确是世界和平的最坚强的前卫了。
    这不仅是苏联人民的军队，而同时是全世界人民的军队。每年苏联的建军节，全世界进步的人民都当成自己的节日一样来庆贺它，不是没有理由的。
    目的是在保卫人民的和平，人民的武力故尔必须强大。结果必能获得人民的支持，人民的武力也就自然强大。苏联军队之所以无敌，原因就在这儿。这是帝国主义者的眼中钉，也是帝国主义者武装竞争的对象，但我们敢于说，这是无法竞争的。这是人民的武力和反人民的武力、和平的武力和侵略的武力、建设性的武力和破坏性的武力、在本质上的不能对比，也就和斤与两不能对比，人与猿猴不能对比的一样。
    但苏联军队不仅在本质上是进步的，即在技术上也是最高的。因为责任大，故尔警觉性强。帝国主义本身就是侵略，就是战争，在末路的危机愈见逼近的时候，愈见有狗急跳墙的危险。战争的威胁在目前的确是存在着。因而在今天来纪念苏联的建军节便愈见增加了它的意义了。我们是应该加强并扩大我们和平的武力，来消灭反人民的帝国主义的侵略战争。
    我们中国人民在今年来纪念这个节日更特别地兴奋。我们的人民解放战争获得了伟大的胜利，以人民为主人的中华人民共和国已经成立，而在最近苏联人民更和我们缔定了中苏友好同盟互助条约，我们在和平时候是经济互助、文化交流，在战争时候是敌忾同仇、并肩作战。我们中国人民和苏联人民永远打成了一片，我们中国人民的武力和苏联人民的武力也永远打成了一片，我们和平的武力的确是扩大而且加强了。
    让帝国主义者们在这伟大的和平武力之前发抖吧！
    人民是不可抵御的，人民的武力是不可抵御的！谁愿与人民为敌，与人民的武力为敌者，谁的命运便同于希特拉、墨索里尼、东条英机！
    人民的前卫、英勇无比的苏联军万岁！
    中苏永久友好与永久合作万岁！
    全世界持久和平与普遍安全万岁！
