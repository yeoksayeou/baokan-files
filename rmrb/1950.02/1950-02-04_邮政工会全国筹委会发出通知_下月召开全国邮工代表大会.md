National Preparatory Committee of the Postal Workers' Union Issues Notice
National Postal Workers' Representative Conference to Be Held Next Month

[Beijing News] The National Preparatory Committee of the Chinese Postal Workers' Union issued a notice regarding the convening of the National Postal Workers' Representative Conference:

The revolutionary war in China has achieved complete victory on the mainland. Tibet, Hainan Island, Taiwan, and other places will soon be liberated. In order to exert greater strength and actively participate in various national construction works, the primary task of us postal workers is to quickly organize ourselves!

At the National Trade Union Work Conference in 1949, the All-China Federation of Trade Unions issued a call to basically organize the Chinese working class within about one year. Postal workers responded to this important call and subsequently established the organization of the National Preparatory Committee of the Chinese Postal Workers' Union under the direct leadership of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions. After half a year of preparation, postal workers' unions in various regions, except for the newly liberated southwestern provinces, have been successively organized. This committee believes that the conditions for establishing a general leading body for postal workers nationwide are ripe, and it has been decided to officially convene the National Postal Workers' Representative Conference in Beijing on March 15, 1950, which has been approved by the All-China Federation of Trade Unions. The notification is as follows:

1.  Address of the conference: Beijing
2.  Date: March 15, 1950
3.  Allocation of representative quotas for each region: 1. National Postal Administration Union: 2 people; 2. Northeast Region: 16 people; 3. North China Region: 34 people; 4.

The following are the main issues to be discussed at this representative conference: (1) Articles of Association; (2) Election of the National Committee; (3) Concluding collective contracts with the administration; (4) Postal labor insurance regulations; (5) Work tasks for 1950. Representatives who have been elected in various regions are requested to fully prepare materials in advance.
5.  In regions with committee or preparatory committee organizations, representatives should be elected in a democratic manner. In regions where committees or preparatory committees have not yet been established, please ask the local trade union to assist the military representatives of each bureau to elect them by appropriate means.

Travel expenses to Beijing will be raised by the local trade union or administration. Please do not bring attendants.
