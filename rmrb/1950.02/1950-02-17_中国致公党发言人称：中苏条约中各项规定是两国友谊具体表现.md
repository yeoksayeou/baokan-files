    The Various Provisions in the Sino-Soviet Treaty are a Concrete Manifestation of Friendship Between the Two Countries
    [This Newspaper’s Dispatch] The China Zhi Gong Party warmly supports the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance. The party’s spokesperson stationed in Beijing stated: The Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance, as well as the agreement on the Chinese Changchun Railway, Lushun and Dalian, and the agreement on the Soviet government granting loans to China, were signed in Moscow on February 14, 1950. This is a major event in world history and the greatest and most unprecedented initiative in China's diplomatic history. Because these treaties and agreements are of great help in ensuring that our country is no longer subjected to imperialist aggression, and in the recovery and development of economic construction. At the same time, it also makes a significant contribution to guaranteeing lasting peace and universal security in the Far East and the world. The task deeply and clearly stipulated in the treaty is that China and the Soviet Union jointly prevent the resurgence of Japanese imperialism or the aggression of Japan and other countries colluding with Japan in any form. This is a concrete manifestation of the friendship between the people of China and the Soviet Union for more than 30 years. The various clauses stipulated in the agreement all illustrate that the Soviet Union truly treats us as equals, which fills our 470 million people with endless gratitude and excitement. At the same time, it completely shatters all the shameless slanders made by the demons and clowns of the imperialist camp who are constantly spreading rumors and slandering the Soviet Union. In addition to thanking our leader Chairman Mao Zedong and our ally Marshal Stalin for their wise leadership, we are determined to wholeheartedly support these treaties and agreements. Long live Sino-Soviet friendship! Long live Marshal Stalin! Long live Chairman Mao Zedong!

　　中国致公党发言人称：
    中苏条约中各项规定是两国友谊具体表现
    【本报讯】中国致公党热烈拥护中苏友好同盟互助条约。该党驻京发言人称：中苏友好同盟互助条约，及关于中国长春铁路、旅顺及大连的协定，关于苏联政府给予中国贷款的协定，已于一九五○年二月十四日在莫斯科签订了。这是世界历史上一件大事，也是中国外交史上向所未有的最伟大的创举。因为这些条约和协定，对于保证我国不再受帝国主义的侵略，以及经济建设事业的恢复与发展，都有极大的帮助。同时对于保证远东和世界的持久和平与普遍安全，亦有重大的贡献。条约中所深切著明规定的任务，是中苏两国共同防止日本帝国主义之再起或日本及其他用任何形式与日本相勾结的国家之侵略，这是中苏两国人民三十余年来的友谊的具体表现。协定中所规定的各项条款，无不说明苏联是真正以平等待我，令我四亿七千万人民感激不尽，兴奋异常。同时也给帝国主义阵营的妖魔小丑们天天在造谣诬蔑苏联的一切无耻谰言以彻底的粉碎。我们对于这些条约及协定，除感谢我们的领袖毛泽东主席及盟邦斯大林大元帅两位巨人英明领导外，誓当竭诚拥护。中苏友好万岁！斯大林大元帅万岁！毛泽东主席万岁！
