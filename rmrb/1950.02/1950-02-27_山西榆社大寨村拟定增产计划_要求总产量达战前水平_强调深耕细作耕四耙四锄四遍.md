　　Shanxi Yushe Dazhai Village Formulates Production Increase Plan
    Demands Total Output Reach Pre-War Levels
    Emphasizes Deep Plowing and Fine Cultivation, Four Plowings, Four Harrowings, and Four Weedings
    [Report from this newspaper] Dazhai Village, Yushe, Shanxi, has formulated its production plan for this year. The village has a total of 237 households and 3,975 mu of land. Last year, thanks to the strong leadership of the Party branch and the efforts of all the farmers, the annual grain output increased by 600 shi. This year, the village's plan requires an increase of 1.5 dou of grain per mu on the basis of last year, demanding that the total agricultural output reach pre-war levels. Farm implements, livestock, and housing should also be fully restored to pre-war levels. The specific measures to achieve this plan are: (1) Emphasize intensive farming and improve agricultural production techniques. It is required that four plowings, four harrowings, and four weedings be universally implemented in cultivation. In terms of technical guidance, the work of the Production Technology Committee should be strengthened. Warm water soaking of seeds should be universally implemented before sowing, requiring seed disinfection to reach 95%. One mu of land will be selected in the village for experimentation, and scientific techniques will be gradually promoted. (2) Increase fertilizer. An average of 65 dan of fertilizer per mu of land is required in the village, with more top dressing in the summer. Accumulating fertilizer should be regarded as a daily production task throughout the year. (3) Repair and procure farm tools and increase livestock. In addition to the existing farm tools, 200 plowshares and 25 jin of plow wings need to be added. Blacksmiths will be organized to start furnaces and manufacture them to ensure that the village has sufficient and convenient farm tools. In addition to the original 120 head of draught animals, 20 more will be added. In addition, geological conditions should be improved and wasteland reclaimed. First, a canal should be opened to turn 32 mu of waterlogged land into fertile fields. Then, 45 mu of beach land will be repaired and 25 mu of wasteland reclaimed. In particular, on the basis of last year, the organization of mutual aid should be strengthened, and 90% of the village's male and female labor force should be organized. The previous leadership experience should be continued, the leadership of the branch should be strengthened, and the role of the People's Congress and the wisdom and labor of all the farmers should be brought into play to complete the above plan. This plan has now been specifically implemented in various natural villages.

　　山西榆社大寨村拟定增产计划
    要求总产量达战前水平
    强调深耕细作耕四耙四锄四遍
    【本报讯】山西榆社大寨村订出今年生产计划。按该村共二百三十七户，土地三千九百七十五亩，去年由于党支部的有力领导，和全体农民的努力，全年增产粮食六百石。今年该村订计划要求在去年的基础上，每亩增产粮食一斗五升，要求农业总产量达到战前水平。农具、牲畜、房舍也完全恢复到战前水平。实现这一计划的具体办法是：（一）强调精耕细作，提高农业生产技术。要求在耕作上普遍做到耕四耙四锄四遍。在技术指导上，要加强生产技术委员会工作，下种前普遍实行温汤浸种，要求籽种消毒达百分之九十五。全村选择一亩地作实验，逐渐推广科学技术。（二）增加肥料，全村每亩土地要平均上肥六十五担，夏季多上追肥。把积肥当成全年日常生产任务。（三）修置农具增加牲畜。除原有农具外，要增置铧子二百个，犁耳二十五斤。并组织铁匠开炉制造，做到全村农具足用，使用方便。除原有一百二十头耕畜外，要再增加二十头。此外并要改良地质，开垦荒滩。首先开通一条水渠，使三十二亩水浸地变为良田。再修滩四十五亩，开荒二十五亩。特别要在去年原有基础上，加强组织互助，把全村男女劳力百分之九十组织起来。并继续发挥以往领导经验，加强支部领导，发挥人代会作用及全体农民的智慧劳力，以完成上述计划。现这一计划已在各自然村中具体贯彻。
