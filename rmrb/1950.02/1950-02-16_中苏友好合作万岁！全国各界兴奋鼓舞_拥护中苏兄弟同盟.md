　　Long Live Sino-Soviet Friendship and Cooperation!
    People from All Walks of Life Across the Country are Excited, Encouraged, and Support the Sino-Soviet Brotherly Alliance
    Yan Jici
    The signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance and various agreements ruthlessly refuted the shameless rumors and slanders made by U.S. Secretary of State Acheson on January 12, and shattered the divisive tactics habitually used by U.S. imperialism. Let it weep and tremble from now on!
    When China and the Soviet Union were consulting and signing this treaty, U.S.-made Chiang Kai-shek planes were frantically bombing Shanghai. This allows those who harbor illusions about imperialism to clearly recognize who are friends and who are enemies.
    Judging from the content of this treaty, it is entirely in line with the interests of both China and the Soviet Union, and the benefits for China are even greater. This is a treaty of true friendship, true alliance, and true mutual assistance. The decision regarding Lushun and the China Changchun Railway, that they will be handed over to China no later than the end of 1952 after the conclusion of the peace treaty with Japan, further proves that the suspicions of those who have a superficial understanding of the Soviet Union are unfounded. It shows that China and the Soviet Union, like brothers, will realistically work together to make a success of the great cause of consolidating lasting peace and universal security.
    The conclusion of this treaty is not only celebrated and encouraged by the people of China, but also warmly supported by the progressive people of the world. Every Chinese person, after learning about this treaty, cannot help but sincerely shout:
    Long Live Sino-Soviet Friendship and Cooperation!
    Long Live Sino-Soviet Friendship and Cooperation!

　　中苏友好合作万岁！
    全国各界兴奋鼓舞  拥护中苏兄弟同盟
    严济慈
    中苏友好同盟互助条约及各项协定的签订，无情地驳斥了美国国务卿艾奇逊一月十二日的无耻造谣诬蔑，粉碎了美帝所惯用的挑拨离间的技俩，让它从此去啼泣和颤抖吧！
    当中苏两国在会商和签订这个条约的时候，美制蒋机却在上海疯狂轰炸，这使那些对于帝国主义抱着幻想的人们，从此可以清楚认识谁是朋友，谁是敌人。
    从这个条约的内容来看，这是完全符合中苏两国的利益的，对于中国，利益更是重大。这是真正的友好、真正的同盟和真正的互助的条约。旅顺和中国长春铁路决定，待对日和约缔结后，不迟于一九五二年末移交中国，这更证明一知半解的人对于苏联的怀疑，是无的放矢，而说明了中苏两国像兄弟一般，要实事求是地共同把巩固永久和平与普遍安全这件大事搞好。
    这个条约的缔结，不但全中国的人民欢忭鼓舞，也是全世界进步人民所热烈拥护的。每一个中国人民，知道了这个条约之后，无不由衷地高呼：
    中苏友好合作万岁！
    中苏友好合作万岁！
