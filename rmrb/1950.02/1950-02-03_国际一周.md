    New Developments in the West European Peace Movement
    While the warmongers are stepping up their preparations for war, while American imperialism and its West European lackeys (Britain, France, Italy, the Netherlands, Belgium, Norway, Denmark, and Luxembourg) are signing "bilateral agreements" for military assistance in Washington, and while the reactionary governments of Western European countries are pointing their guns at the peace-loving masses, the people of Western European countries who oppose war against the Soviet Union, who oppose colonial wars, and who are unwilling to be cannon fodder for American imperialism, have become more aware and are fighting to defend peace in new and more effective ways. The powerful struggle against accepting American military equipment and against national militarization is expanding in Western European countries, especially in France, Italy, the Netherlands, Belgium, and Denmark. The most noteworthy form of this struggle is the growing movement to refuse to transport American war materials.
    The French working class is the initiator of the movement to refuse to transport war materials and the movement to refuse to produce war materials. French dockworkers, sailors, and railway workers have shown particular heroism, refusing to unload or transship war materials from the United States, and also refusing to load or transship war materials to Vietnam. Famous French ports such as Marseille, Toulon, Le Havre, Nantes, Rouen, Saint-Nazaire, and Dunkirk have now become the front lines of the brave struggle against the warmongers. The resolute struggle of the French dockworkers has received support in all aspects from the working people throughout the country. At the same time, under their initiative, the movement to refuse to transport American war materials has also become a common form of struggle adopted by the working people of Western European countries. The ports of Ancona, Genoa, Savona, La Spezia, and Imperia in Italy, the ports of Amsterdam and Rotterdam in the Netherlands, and the ports of Brussels, Antwerp, and Ostend in Belgium have all seen widespread movements to refuse to transport American war materials.
    The French people have also widely launched the "Peace for Vietnam" movement. Since the beginning of this year, demonstrations and strikes against the continuation of the Vietnam War have sprung up one after another throughout France, among which the large-scale demonstration and 24-hour strike in Marseille on January 10th had the greatest impact. The establishment of the "French United Action Committee for Peace in Vietnam" and the holding of the "National Day for Peace in Vietnam" on January 25th show that the French people are actively opposed to the colonial war in Vietnam. Within the National Assembly, a struggle against the reactionary government's policy of colonial war against Vietnam has also been launched. Both inside and outside the National Assembly, the French Communist Party is the leader of the "Peace for Vietnam" movement.
    Two New Elections Under Two Systems
    The election of the Supreme Soviet, the highest organ of state power in the Soviet Union, is scheduled for March 12th. Throughout the Soviet Union, from Leningrad to Sakhalin Island, from Georgia to the Arctic region, a political upsurge in preparation for the election has been set off. The Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union is composed of the Union Council and the Council of Nationalities. According to the recently announced election district regulations, 671 election districts for the Union Council and 631 election districts for the Council of Nationalities have been established throughout the Soviet Union. The Soviet Constitution stipulates that one representative shall be elected to the Union Council for every 300,000 people, while the Council of Nationalities shall be elected on the basis of 25 representatives for each Union Republic, 11 representatives for each Autonomous Republic, 5 representatives for each Autonomous Region, and 1 representative for each National District. In order to preside over the election of the Supreme Soviet, the Central Election Commission, headed by Osipov, has also been formed.
    The election of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union is an extremely important political event in the lives of the Soviet people. In this great political movement, the Soviet people will fully utilize and develop socialist democracy to exercise their right to elect the highest organ of state power in the socialist country; they will summarize the achievements of their activities in the four years since the last Supreme Soviet election in order to achieve new victories; they will learn during the election movement in order to deeply understand the overall picture of the policies of the Soviet Communist Party and the Soviet government. The promulgated election regulations of the Supreme Soviet embody the truly democratic election system of the socialist country. The purpose of each chapter and each article of these election regulations is to ensure that the people can freely express their will. The election of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union will vividly show the superiority of the socialist political system to the whole world.
    In sharp contrast to the election of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union is the British general election. The election of the British House of Commons is scheduled for February 23rd, which is the second general election after the war. Under the domination of the bourgeois political system, whether it is after the war or before the war, there is no real freedom in the British election system. In Britain, there is not even proportional representation. There are many restrictions on voters and candidates, and the entire election organization is controlled by the ruling class and its lackeys. The British government's restriction on the Communist Party of Great Britain's General Secretary Pollitt from conducting campaign broadcasts is a recent example. In this way, the people cannot freely express their will. This unreasonable election will once again expose how hypocritical the so-called democracy of the bourgeoisie is. Now, whether it is the Conservative Party, the Liberal Party, or the Labour Party, they have all issued election manifestos. These manifestos full of empty promises are to confuse voters. Their common purpose is to engage in political speculation and win votes. The Communist Party of Great Britain has also issued an election manifesto. This is fundamentally different from the manifestos of the bourgeois parties. It is not just an election platform, but an action program. Its purpose is to finally defeat conservatism and build a socialist Britain, free from exploitation, crisis, and war.
    New Victory of Planned Economy
    When the economic situation in the capitalist world is deteriorating, when the economic activity index of the United States (the largest capitalist country) at the end of 1949 was far below the pre-war level, in socialist countries and people's democratic countries, their national economies are on the rise and have greatly exceeded the pre-war level, especially in industry.
    In 1949, the Soviet economy achieved great achievements: industrial output exceeded the already expanded 1949 plan by 3 percent; in the fourth quarter of 1949, its average monthly total industrial output exceeded the 1940 level by 53 percent; the total agricultural output also exceeded the 1940 level. In 1949, the economies of the people's democratic countries also achieved great achievements. In Czechoslovakia, total industrial output exceeded the annual production plan by 2.8 percent, and at the beginning of 1949, the country's industrial production level had already more than doubled the 1937 level. In Poland, the three-year economic plan was completed ahead of schedule in 1949, and industrial production has now exceeded the pre-war level by 75 percent, while industrial output per person has exceeded the pre-war level by 2.5 times. In Hungary, the three-year economic plan was completed ahead of schedule in 1949, and industrial output at the beginning of 1949 was 27 percent higher than in 1938. In Romania, the 1949 national economic plan was successfully completed, exceeding the plan by 8 percent. The output of all sectors of industry has exceeded the 1938 production level. In Bulgaria, the 1949 national economic plan was successfully completed, and in 1948, the country's industrial production had increased by 71.5 percent compared with 1939. In Albania, the 1949 industrial production was 431 percent of the 1938 level.
    In the Soviet Union, the current characteristic is that the first post-war five-year economic plan (1946-1950) is about to be completed ahead of schedule. In the people's democratic countries, the current characteristic is that the transition from short-term planned economies to long-term planned economies is beginning, in order to lay the foundation for entering socialism. Poland has completed its three-year plan and started implementing its six-year plan this year; Hungary has completed its three-year plan and started implementing its five-year plan this year; the Czech Republic has completed its two-year plan and started implementing its five-year plan last year; Bulgaria has completed its two-year plan and also started implementing its five-year plan last year; Romania has completed its one-year plan and will also start implementing its five-year plan this year.
    The economic victories of socialist countries and people's democratic countries are also the victories of the economic systems of these countries. If compared with the capitalist economic system, the great superiority of the economic systems of these countries is obvious.

    西欧保卫和平运动的新发展
    当战争贩子正在加紧备战的时候，当美国帝国主义和它的西欧走卒（英、法、意、荷、比、挪、丹、卢）正在华盛顿签订军事援助的“双边协定”的时候，当西欧诸国的反动政府正以枪口对准着和平群众的时候，西欧各国反对对苏战争的人们，反对殖民战争的人们，不愿充当美帝国主义炮灰的人们，已更加觉悟起来，并正以新的更加有效的方式，进行保卫和平的斗争。反对接受美国军备的强有力的斗争，反对国家军事化的斗争，正在西欧各国扩展着，特别是在法、意、荷、比、丹诸国扩展着。这种斗争中最引人注意的形式，是日益扩大的拒运美国战争物资的运动。
    法国工人阶级是拒绝运输战争物资运动和拒绝生产战争物资运动的发起人。法国的码头工人、海员工人和铁路工人表现得特别英勇，他们既拒绝起卸或转运来自美国的战争物资，也拒绝装载或转运送往越南的战争物资。法国的著名港口，诸如马赛、土伦、哈佛尔、南特、卢昂、圣那最尔和敦克尔克，现在都变成反对战争贩子的勇敢斗争的最前线。法国码头工人的坚决斗争，受到全国劳动人民在各方面的支援。同时，在他们的倡导之下，拒运美国战争物资的运动，也已变成西欧诸国劳动人民共同采用的斗争形式。意大利的安科纳、热那亚、萨窝那、拉斯皮齐亚、茵皮里亚等港口，荷兰的阿姆斯特丹、鹿特丹等港口，比利时的布鲁塞尔、安特衡普、俄斯坦得等港口，都普遍地掀起了拒运美国战争物资的运动。
    法国人民还广泛地开展了“给越南和平”运动。今年以来，法国各地因为反对继续越南战争而举行的示威和罢工层出不穷，其中以一月十日马赛的大示威和二十四小时罢工影响最大。“法国争取越南和平联合行动委员会”的成立，以及一月二十五日“全国争取越南和平日”的举行，显示法国人民积极反对在越南进行殖民战争。在国民议会中间，也掀起了反对反动政府对越南进行殖民战争政策的斗争。不论在国会内外，法国共产党都是“给越南和平”运动的领导者。
    两种制度的两次新选举
    苏联最高国家权力机关——最高苏维埃的选举，定于三月十二日举行。在苏联全国，从列宁格勒到库页岛，从乔治亚到北极地带，现已掀起准备选举的政治热潮。苏联最高苏维埃由联盟院和民族院共同组成。按照最近公布的选区法令，全苏已成立了六百七十一个选举联盟院的选区和六百三十一个选举民族院的选区。苏联宪法规定：每三十万人口选出一名代表到联盟院，而民族院则按照每个加盟共和国选举代表二十五名，每一自治共和国选举代表十一名，每一自治州选举代表五名，和每一民族区选举代表一名产生。为了主持最高苏维埃的选举事宜，以奥希波夫为首的中央选举委员会亦已组成。
    苏联最高苏维埃的选举，是苏联人民生活中极其重大的政治事件。在这一伟大的政治运动中，苏联人民将充分运用和发展社会主义的民主，以行使其选举社会主义国家的最高国家权力机关的权利；他们将总结上次最高苏维埃选举以来四年中活动的成果，以便获得新的胜利；他们将在选举运动中进行学习，以便深刻地了解苏联共产党和苏联政府政策的全貌。业经公布的最高苏维埃选举条例，体现了社会主义国家的真正民主的选举制度，这一选举条例的每一章和每一条的目的，都在于确保人民可以自由地表示他们的意志。苏联最高苏维埃的选举，将向全世界生动地显示出社会主义政治制度的优越性。
    和苏联最高苏维埃选举将成为鲜明对照的是英国的大选。英国下院的选举定于二月二十三日举行，这是战后的第二次大选。在资产阶级的政治制度支配之下，不论是战后或者战前，英国的选举制度是没有真正自由可言的。在英国，连比例选举之类的东西都是没有的，选举人和被选人都有很多的限制，整个的选举机构都把持在统治阶级及其走卒的手中。英国政府之限制英国共产党总书记波立特进行竞选广播，就是一个最近的例子。这样，人民就无法自由地表示他们的意志。这种不合理的选举，将再一次地暴露资产阶级的所谓民主是如何的虚伪。现在，不论是保守党、自由党或工党，都发表了竞选宣言，这些空洞诺言的宣言是迷惑选民的，其共同的目的是进行政治投机、骗取选票。英国共产党也发表了竞选宣言，这是和资产阶级政党的宣言根本不同的，它不仅仅是一个竞选纲领，而且是一个行动纲领，其目的，在于最后击败保守主义，建设社会主义的英国，免除剥削、危机及战争。
    计划经济的新胜利
    当资本主义世界的经济情势日益恶化的时候，当美国（最大的资本主义国家）的经济活动指数在一九四九年底远低于战前水平的时候，在社会主义国家和人民民主国家，它们的国民经济却在高涨中，并已大大超过战前水平，特别是在工业方面。
    一九四九年，苏联的经济获得了伟大的成就：工业产量超过业已扩大了的一九四九年计划的百分之三；在一九四九年的第四季，其每月平均的工业总产量，已超过一九四○年水平的百分之五十三；农业的总生产量亦已超过一九四○年的水平。一九四九年，人民民主国家的经济同样获得了伟大的成就。在捷克斯洛伐克，全部工业产量超过全年生产计划的百分之二点八，而在一九四九年年初时，该国的工业生产水平即已比一九三七年的水平增加了一倍多。在波兰，三年经济计划已于一九四九年提前完成，工业生产量现已超过战前水平百分之七十五，而每人的工业产量则已超过战前二点五倍。在匈牙利，三年经济计划已于一九四九年提前完成，工业产量在一九四九年年初时，即已较一九三八年提高了百分之二十七。在罗马尼亚，一九四九年的国民经济计划已胜利完成，并超过计划百分之八，工业各部门的产量，都已超过一九三八年的生产水平。在保加利亚，一九四九年的国民经济计划已胜利完成，而在一九四八年时，该国的工业生产量即已比一九三九年增加了百分之七十一点五。在阿尔巴尼亚，一九四九年的工业生产量已为一九三八年水平的百分之四百三十一。
    在苏联，目前的特点是，战后第一个五年经济计划（一九四六——一九五○年）即将提前完成。在人民民主国家，目前的特点是，开始由短期的计划经济过渡到长期的计划经济，以奠定进入社会主义的基础。波兰已完成三年计划，今年已开始实行六年计划；匈牙利已完成了三年计划，今年已开始实行五年计划；捷克已完成两年计划，去年即已开始实行五年计划；保加利亚已完成两年计划，亦已于去年开始实行五年计划；罗马尼亚已完成一年计划，今年亦已开始实行五年计划。
    社会主义国家和人民民主国家在经济上的胜利，也就是这些国家经济制度的胜利，如果和资本主义的经济制度作一比较，那么，这些国家的经济制度的巨大优越性是显而易见的了。
