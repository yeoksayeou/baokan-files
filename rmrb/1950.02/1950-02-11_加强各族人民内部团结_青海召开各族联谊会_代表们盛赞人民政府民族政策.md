Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, February 9th: Xining Report: The Qinghai Provincial People's Government convened its first Ethnic Groups Friendship Conference from the 10th to the 15th of last month, focusing on discussing and initially resolving three major issues: strengthening unity among all ethnic groups in the province, consolidating social order, and developing trade in the Mongolian and Tibetan areas. The conference participants included 512 representatives from 22 units and 17 cities and counties, representing various ethnic groups and sectors, including Han, Mongolian, Hui, and Tibetan. Liao Hansheng, Vice Chairman of the Provincial People's Government, reviewed the work of implementing the policy of ethnic unity, consolidating social order, and developing trade in Mongolian and Tibetan areas in Qinghai Province in the three months since liberation in his opening speech. Subsequently, Zhou Renshan and Fu Zihe, members of the Provincial People's Government, and Li Guang, head of the Provincial Public Security Department, made central speeches on the three issues. Representatives of all ethnic groups engaged in heated discussions in a spirit of mutual assistance and candor.

Regarding the issue of unity among all ethnic groups, Zhou Renshan, a member of the Provincial Government, pointed out: Since the liberation of Qinghai Province, thanks to the correct implementation of the ethnic policy in the Common Program, the people of all ethnic groups have gradually united. However, because the correct policies have not been well implemented, some estrangement between ethnic groups has not yet been eliminated. For example, some Han and Hui people have a contemptuous attitude towards Mongolian and Tibetan compatriots; a few Han people attribute the crimes of the Ma bandits and their henchmen to the Hui people; and a few Hui people, influenced by the rumors created by the Kuomintang bandit gang, regard the Communist Party, the People's Liberation Army, and the People's Government in the same way as some Han people with great Han chauvinistic views. A few Mongolian compatriots in pastoral areas regard the local Hui and Han people as the same as the Ma bandits and their lackeys and special agents. This kind of ethnic estrangement is the result of Ma Bufang's long-term reactionary rule. Zhou Renshan also put forward suggestions on mutual assistance and unity among all ethnic groups based on the common interests of all ethnic groups for the reference of the representatives present. After in-depth discussions, the representatives expressed heartfelt praise for the People's Government's conscientious implementation of the ethnic policy in the Common Program and the People's Liberation Army's practical respect for the customs and habits of all ethnic groups. The meeting believes that in the future, the government should resolutely implement the correct ethnic policy, strengthen the internal unity of all ethnic groups, and use consultation to review and resolve disputes, so as to eliminate the ethnic estrangement created by the reactionary ruling class in history and the doubts of some people about the People's Government.

Resolutely Eliminate Bandits and Special Agents and Consolidate Social Order in the Territory

Regarding the issue of social order, Li Guang, the head of the Provincial Public Security Department, said in his speech: In the three months since the liberation of Qinghai Province, the People's Liberation Army has successively wiped out more than 6,000 bandits; in December of last year, it quickly eliminated bandits who attempted to cause disturbance, and killed the bandit leader Ma Ying; the people's hearts have gradually stabilized. In the future, the policy of combining military suppression, political disintegration, and mobilizing the masses for self-defense should be implemented in order to completely eliminate the remaining bandits. The representatives all spoke enthusiastically on the issue of bandit suppression. Wanjiacaike, a Tibetan representative from Niêqên County, and others hoped that the representatives of all ethnic groups would take active responsibility, organize the people of their own ethnic groups, and resolutely expose and eliminate the scattered bandits and special agents hiding in various places. Huabaozang, a Tibetan representative from Gangca, suggested that all localities should, under the leadership of the People's Government, absorb activists from all ethnic groups to form security committees or security groups, and resolutely and thoroughly eliminate the remaining bandits and special agents.

Develop Trade in Mongolian and Tibetan Areas and Implement Free and Fair Exchange

Regarding the issue of trade, the representatives enthusiastically supported the clear policy pointed out by Fu Zihe, a member of the Provincial Government, that "trade should be free, exchanges should be fair, and commerce beneficial to the people of all ethnic groups should be vigorously developed." The meeting believes that the work of the trade company of the Provincial People's Government since the liberation of Qinghai Province has been successful. According to incomplete statistics, the trade company has supplied the people of all ethnic groups with more than 25,000 bolts of cloth, more than 5,000 jin of tea, and many other items at prices lower than the market. At the meeting, Su Anxiangbei, a Tibetan representative from Yushu, excitedly stated: He will resolutely implement the trade policy of the People's Government and organize his own cattle, horses, and camels to transport Yushu's special products such as wool, leather goods, deer antler, and musk to promote material exchange. The meeting believes that in the future, in addition to implementing the principles of free trade and fair exchange and continuing to develop trade with Tibetan and Mongolian ethnic areas, trade cadres of all ethnic groups should be trained and the organization of trade companies should be improved, so as to gradually promote the production undertakings in pastoral areas and improve the lives of the people of all ethnic groups.

Finally, the meeting passed a telegram of salute to Chairman Mao and all Vice Chairmen of the Central People's Government, and a telegram of salute to Chairman Peng Dehuai and others of the Northwest Military and Political Committee. After the closing of the meeting, more than 20,000 people from all walks of life in Xining held a grand celebration.

　　加强各族人民内部团结
    青海召开各族联谊会
    代表们盛赞人民政府民族政策
    【新华社北京九日电】西宁讯：青海省人民政府于上月十日至十五日召开首届各族人民联谊会，着重讨论并初步解决了加强该省各民族团结、巩固社会治安和发展蒙、藏区贸易等三大问题。与会代表包括二十二个单位，十七个市县的汉、蒙、回、藏等各民族各界代表共五百一十二人。省人民政府副主席廖汉生在开幕词中检讨了青海省解放三个月来执行各民族团结政策和巩固社会治安、发展蒙藏区贸易的工作情况后，继由省人民政府委员周仁山、傅子和，省公安厅负责人黎光，就三个问题作中心发言。各族代表都以和衷共济、开诚布公的精神展开热烈讨论。
    关于各民族团结问题，省府周仁山委员指出：青海省解放后，由于正确执行了共同纲领中的民族政策，各族人民已逐渐团结起来，但因正确的政策尚未很好贯彻，以致尚未能消除各族间的某些隔阂。如少数汉回人民对蒙、藏同胞存在着轻视态度；少数汉民把马匪及其爪牙的罪恶加于回民身上；少数回民因受国民党匪帮造谣的影响而把共产党、人民解放军和人民政府与某些具有大民族主义观点的汉民同样看待。牧畜区少数蒙族同胞，把当地回、汉人民和马匪及其走狗、特务等同等看待；这种民族隔阂都是马匪步芳长期反动统治所造成的结果。周仁山委员并根据各族人民共同利益提出有关各族互助团结的意见，供到会代表参考。各代表经过深入讨论后，对人民政府认真执行共同纲领的民族政策，和解放军切实尊重各族风俗习惯等，表示衷心赞扬。会议认为：今后政府应坚决贯彻执行正确的民族政策，加强各族人民内部的团结，遇有纠纷多用协商方式检讨解决，就一定能够消除历史上反动统治阶级所造成的民族隔阂及部分人民对于人民政府的疑虑。
    坚决肃清土匪特务巩固境内社会治安
    关于治安问题，省公安厅负责人黎光在发言中称：青海省解放三个月来，人民解放军先后剿除土匪约六千余人；去年十二月又将企图骚动的股匪迅速消灭，并击毙匪首马英；人心已渐趋安定。今后应贯彻执行军事清剿、政治瓦解和发动群众自卫相结合的剿匪方针，以期完全肃清残余土匪。各代表对剿匪问题均热烈发言。涅源藏族代表万加才科等希望各族代表积极负责，组织本族人民，坚决检举、肃清隐藏各地的散匪和特务。藏族代表刚察千户华宝藏建议各地应在人民政府领导下，吸收各族积极分子组织治安委员会或治安小组，坚决彻底肃清残余土匪特务。
    发展蒙、藏区贸易实行自由公平交换
    关于贸易问题，各代表对傅子和委员所指出的“贸易自由、公平交换、大力开展对各族人民有利的商业”的明确方针，表示热烈拥护。会议认为青海省解放以来省人民政府贸易公司的工作是有成绩的。据不完全统计，贸易公司以低于市场的价格，供给了各族人民布匹两万五千余匹、茶叶五千余斤和其它各种物品甚多。会上玉树藏族代表素安巷贝兴奋地表示：将坚决执行人民政府的贸易政策，组织自己的牛马、骆驼运出玉树的特产羊毛、皮货、鹿茸、麝香等，以促使物资交流。会议认为，今后除贯彻贸易自由和公平交换原则，继续发展对藏、蒙民族地区贸易外，并应培养各民族贸易干部，健全贸易公司组织，以逐渐促进游牧区的生产事业，改善各民族人民的生活。
    最后会议通过了给中央人民政府毛主席和各副主席的致敬电，向西北军政委员会彭德怀主席等致敬电。会议闭幕后西宁市各界两万余人曾举行盛大的庆祝会。
