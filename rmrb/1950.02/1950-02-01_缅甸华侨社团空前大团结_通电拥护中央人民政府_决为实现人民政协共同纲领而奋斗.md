　　Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, January 31st: According to a Rangoon dispatch published in the Singapore Nanyang Siang Pau on January 4th, forty-eight overseas Chinese organizations in Burma jointly issued a telegram in December of last year, warmly endorsing the Central People's Government. The telegram declared: In an atmosphere of unprecedented unity, overseas Chinese in Burma, for the first time, express their warm endorsement, respect, and gratitude to Chairman Mao, the Central People's Government, the People's Liberation Army, all democratic parties, people's organizations, and compatriots across the country, the people's leaders of our new motherland.

　　The telegram continued: For many years, overseas Chinese in Burma have been expecting the birth of a new motherland that is independent, free, happy, and strong. This hope is very natural and sincere. Now, the day we can hold our heads high has finally arrived. October 1st, this unforgettable and glorious day, made us feel as if we were personally witnessing the convening of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference in Beijing, personally seeing Chairman Mao formally announce the birth of the People's Republic of China to the world. From that day on, a great giant stood up from the eastern horizon, and the imperialists, reactionaries, and warmongers trembled before him, while peace-loving and democratic people all over the world cheered and expressed their respect. Overseas Chinese also feel very honored.

　　The telegram recalled: On October 2nd, more than forty progressive overseas Chinese organizations in Burma resolved to hold a mass celebration rally and a carnival on Double Ten Day. However, because Chiang Kai-shek's henchmen used hooligan tactics to try their best to prevent and sabotage it, the mass rally could not be held, but we still successfully held the carnival.

　　The telegram rebuked the Kuomintang bandit gang for sending a large number of special agents and henchmen to Burma, exhausting all kinds of despicable and wicked conspiracies to suppress the overseas Chinese democratic movement in Burma.

　　The telegram called on all overseas Chinese in Burma to sincerely support the Central People's Government, resolutely oppose any conspiracy by the imperialists to sabotage the new motherland, and, under the leadership of the Central People's Government, strive to realize the Common Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference.

　　The telegram was signed by forty-eight organizations including the Burmese Chinese Chamber of Commerce, the Overseas Chinese Shop Employees' Union, the Overseas Chinese Industrial and Commercial Association, the Overseas Chinese Women's Association, and the Overseas Chinese Students' Union.

　　缅甸华侨社团空前大团结
    通电拥护中央人民政府   
    决为实现人民政协共同纲领而奋斗
    【新华社北京三十一日电】据新加坡南侨日报一月四日刊载的仰光通讯称：去年十二月间，缅甸华侨四十八个社团曾联合发表热诚拥护中央人民政府的通电。通电宣称：缅甸华侨在空前大团结的愉快气氛中，首次向我们新祖国的人民领袖毛主席、中央人民政府、人民解放军、各民主政党、人民团体及全国同胞，表示热诚的拥护、崇敬与感激。
    通电继称：许多年来，缅甸侨胞就一直期望着一个独立、自由、幸福、强盛的新祖国的诞生。这种希望是非常自然而真挚的。现在，我们扬眉吐气的日子终于来到了。十月一日，这个令人难忘的辉煌日子，使我们有如亲眼看见北京人民政协会议的召开，亲眼看到毛主席向全世界正式宣布中华人民共和国诞生。从这一天起，一个伟大的巨人就从东方的地平线上站立起来，帝国主义、反动派、战争贩子都对着他发抖，而全世界爱好和平民主的人民，都为他额手称庆，表示敬意。海外华侨，也觉得非常荣幸。
    通电回溯称：十月二日，缅甸四十余进步侨团曾经决议，于双十节举行群众庆祝大会和游艺晚会，但因蒋党爪牙利用流氓手段，竭力阻止和破坏，使群众大会未能举行，但我们仍成功地举行了游艺晚会。
    通电斥责国民党匪帮派出大批特务爪牙到缅甸，使尽种种卑鄙恶劣阴谋，以镇压缅甸华侨民主运动。
    通电号召全缅华侨至诚拥护中央人民政府，坚决反对帝国主义破坏新祖国的任何阴谋活动，并在中央人民政府领导之下，为实现人民政协共同纲领而奋斗。
    署名此一通电的有缅甸华商商会、华侨店员联合会、华侨兴商总会、华侨妇女协会、华侨学生联合会等四十八个团体。
