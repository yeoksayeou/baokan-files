Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, February 27th: The Ministry of Agriculture of the Central People's Government recently issued instructions regarding the agricultural production policy and grain and cotton production increase plan for 1950. The full text is as follows:

(1) Due to the long-term war and enemy destruction, the national agricultural production level has generally declined by about a quarter compared to before the Anti-Japanese War. In some newly liberated areas, it has even declined by about a third. Although the old liberated areas have undergone several years of production recovery, they are still about 15% lower than before the war. Therefore, the agricultural production policy for 1950 is to focus on recovery.

Under this general policy, the agricultural production in the old areas this year is required to increase by 10% compared to the 1949 production level. Old areas with better production conditions should strive to restore their pre-war production level. General newly liberated areas are required to maintain the 1949 production level; new areas with better conditions should strive for a slight increase. Disaster areas are required to overcome floods, droughts, and other disasters.

(2) The center of agricultural production in 1950 is to increase the production of grain and cotton. The specific requirement is to increase grain production by 10 billion catties and ginned cotton by 4.77 million dan (this year a total of 50 million mu of cotton will be planted, producing 13.28 million dan of ginned cotton) based on the current level. The allocated figures for grain and cotton production increase in each region are: Grain: Northeast region to increase by 2.4 billion catties, North China region by 2.5 billion catties, old areas of East China by 1.9 billion catties, new areas of East China by 1.3 billion catties, Central South China region by 1 billion catties, Henan Province by 650 million catties, old areas of Northwest China by 50 million catties, and new areas of Northwest China by 280 million catties. Cotton: Northeast region to plant 3.3 million mu, North China region 18 million mu, East China region 15.2 million mu, Central South China region 10.27 million mu, and Northwest region 3.88 million mu. Each region should also strive to restore and increase the production of special crops and export products according to local conditions. To complete this production increase plan, the following specific measures are determined.

	1.  Massively mobilize and organize labor to restore and improve the level of cultivation. Organizing labor mutual aid should become a habit for farmers in the old areas and reach more than half of the labor force. In the new areas, it should also be promoted through typical examples based on existing habits. Mobilize women to participate in agricultural production. In old areas with a foundation, it should reach 50% to 70% of the female labor force; in general areas, it should reach around 40%; and in new areas, general promotion should also be carried out.

	2.  Breed draught animals and livestock. In 1950, 10 million head of livestock should be vaccinated; and the breeding of pigs, chickens, sheep, and other livestock should be greatly increased. In the old areas, the number of draught animals should be increased by 1.4 million; the new areas should also maintain the existing number, prohibit the slaughter of draught cattle, and strive to increase their numbers.

	3.  Build water conservancy projects. Increase paddy fields and irrigated land by 8.5 million mu, including 5.8 million mu of land expanded for irrigation by improving and building canals, digging 110,000 new wells, and adding 110,000 waterwheels. Including the repair of old wells, old waterwheels, machine drilling, and pump irrigation, a total of 2.7 million mu of paddy fields can be increased. In waterlogged areas, attention should be paid to drainage to protect farmland.

	4.  Increase fertilizer application. Old areas should increase by 15%, and new areas should also increase appropriately. This mainly relies on breeding draught animals to greatly increase farmyard manure, maximizing the use of human manure and urine, organizing urban manure to go to the countryside, and promoting green manure, smoked manure, silt application, and pond digging according to local conditions.

	5.  Prevent and control plant diseases and insect pests. Launch mass insect and pest control campaigns, master the occurrence patterns of pests for prevention and control to prevent disasters. Establish pest control stations in areas with serious insect infestations. Use a large amount of Hunan tin stone and try to use pesticides and machinery to kill insects. Use seed dressing with pesticides to prevent black smut and nematode diseases on 50 million mu.

	6.  Promote improved varieties. Launch and organize seed selection campaigns, and adjust and exchange seeds locally. In 1950, promote improved cotton seeds on 10 million mu, and rice, millet, and other seeds on 3.8 million mu.

	7.  Support ironware shops and blacksmith shops to repair and manufacture agricultural tools in large quantities. Focus on manufacturing some new-style horse-drawn farm implements. Trial run horse-drawn farm implement stations.

	8.  Restore and expand cultivated land area. All wasteland in various places should be supported and encouraged to be reclaimed. According to recent estimates, 14 million mu can be reclaimed this year, of which 1 million mu of cultivated land will be expanded by trial-running state-owned farms. In addition, the reclaimed area should be expanded as much as possible, and all cultivated wasteland must be restored in a short period of time to increase grain or other crop production.

	9.  Strengthen agricultural scientific research. In terms of experimental research, emphasis should be placed on ensuring the increase of grain and cotton production. In terms of breeding, grain and cotton should be the main focus. It is also necessary to strengthen the research on the prevention and control of plant diseases and insect pests and on animal husbandry and veterinary medicine. Start research on crop rotation, intercropping, rhizobia, and saline-alkali land improvement.

(3) Regarding the increase in production in 1950, it should be clearly recognized that the subjective effort should be made to improve the existing level of cultivation, fertilization, and production technology to achieve increased production, rather than using the goodness or badness of the weather as the standard for increased production. In disaster areas, it is necessary to effectively lead the masses to build water conservancy projects, accumulate fertilizer, repair agricultural tools, prepare seeds, and ensure timely sowing.

(4) In order to solve the difficulties of farmers and stimulate and promote the development of agricultural production, necessary investment and loans must be given, but the main thing should be to rely on and mobilize the strength of the masses, and develop rural credit lending to overcome the idea of simply relying on state loans. The state's investment loans should focus on the old areas and should be limited to undertakings that are indeed effective for increasing grain production in 1950, such as water conservancy, agricultural tools, seeds, pesticides and machinery for disease and pest control, breeding livestock, and veterinary medicine.

(5) All localities must ensure the implementation of the policies and plans determined at the National Agricultural Production Conference. However, due to the vastness of our country and the different natural conditions such as land and climate, and the very uneven work base, under the overall national policy and plan, all regions must "adapt to local conditions," formulate specific plans suitable for local conditions, and formulate specific implementation methods through bottom-up revisions to ensure the completion of the plan.

After the plan is formulated, the most important issue is organization. To this end, it is necessary to conduct in-depth publicity and mobilization work, implement the policy of rewarding production, and promote the development of labor. It is necessary to organize all aspects of strength, fully utilize and develop favorable conditions, overcome difficulties, overcome disasters, deepen into the masses, improve existing production methods and experience, and widely apply new technologies.

　　中央人民政府农业部发布指示
    今年农业以恢复为主  生产中心是增产粮棉
    要在现有水平上增产食粮百亿斤皮棉四七七万担  增产要加强主观努力不以天年好坏为标准
    【新华社北京二十七日电】中央人民政府农业部顷发布关于一九五○年农业生产方针及粮棉增产计划的指示全文如下：
    （一）由于长期战争的消耗与敌寇的破坏，使全国农业生产水平，一般较抗日战争前下降约四分之一，某些新解放地区，甚至下降到三分之一左右。老解放区虽经过几年来生产运动的恢复，仍较战前低百分之十五左右。因之一九五○年的农业生产方针是以恢复生产为主。
    在这个总方针下，对老区今年的农业生产，要求比一九四九年的生产水平提高一成；生产条件较好的老区，应争取恢复战前的生产水平。对一般新解放区，要求保持一九四九年的生产水平；条件较好的新区争取略加提高。灾区则要求其战胜水、旱等灾。
    （二）一九五○年农业生产的中心是增产粮食和棉花。具体要求是在现有水平上，增产食粮一百亿斤，增产皮棉四七七万担（今年共植棉五千万亩，产皮棉一三二八万担）。各地区关于粮棉增产的分配数字是：粮食：东北区增产二十四亿斤，华北区二十五亿斤，华东老区十九亿斤，华东新区十三亿斤，华中南区十亿斤，河南省六亿五千万斤，西北老区五千万斤，西北新区二亿八千万斤。棉花：东北区植棉三百三十万亩，华北区一千八百万亩，华东区一千五百二十万亩，华中南区一千零二十七万亩，西北区三百八十八万亩。各地区对特种作物及出口品，亦应因地制宜，争取恢复与增产。为完成这一增产计划，特确定如下的具体措施。
    １、大量发动与组织劳动力以恢复及提高耕作水平。组织劳动互助，在老区应成为农民习惯，并达劳力的一半以上；在新区，亦应在旧有的习惯下，通过典型加以推广。动员妇女参加农业生产，在有基础的老区应达妇女劳力的百分之五十至七十；一般地区应达百分之四十上下；新区亦应作一般提倡。
    ２、繁殖耕畜家畜。一九五○年要进行防疫注射一千万头；并大量增殖猪、鸡、羊等家畜。在老区，应增殖耕畜一百四十万头；新区也应保持现有数量，禁宰耕牛并争取增殖。
    ３、兴修水利。增加稻田与水地八五○万亩，其中整理、修筑渠道，扩大浇地面积五八○万亩，打新井十一万眼，增水车十一万辆，连修复旧井、旧水车、机器凿井、抽水灌溉，共可增水田二七○万亩。在水涝地区，应注意排水，保护农田。
    ４、增施肥料，老区应增加百分之十五，新区亦应适当增加。这主要依靠繁殖耕畜以大量增加厩肥，尽量利用人粪，人尿，组织城粪下乡，并根据各地具体条件，提倡压绿肥、熏粪，放淤、挖塘等。
    ５、防除病虫害，开展群众性的除虫防害运动，掌握害虫的发生规律进行防治不使成灾。在严重虫害发生地区，设立治虫工作站。大量采用湖南信石，并尽量利用药械杀虫。用药剂拌种法防治黑穗病及线虫病五千万亩。
    ６、推广优良品种，发动与组织选种运动，并就地互相调剂与调换。一九五○年推广优良棉种一千万亩，稻、谷等三百八十万亩。
    ７、扶植铁器铺、铁匠炉、木匠铺大量修补与制造农具。有重点的制造一些新式马拉农具。试办马拉农具站。
    ８、恢复并扩大耕地面积，所有各地生产熟荒，应扶植奖励开垦。据最近估计，本年可垦荒一千四百万亩，其中试办成国营农场，扩大的耕地为一百万亩。此外仍应尽量扩大开垦面积，务须在短时期内，恢复所有熟荒地，以增产粮食或其他作物。
    ９、加强农业科学研究工作。在试验研究工作方面，应着重保障粮棉的增产。在育种工作方面，应以粮棉为主。并须加强防除病虫害和畜牧兽医的研究。着手轮作，间作、根瘤菌及盐碱地改良的研究。
    （三）关于一九五○年的增产，应明确认识是在耕锄、施肥与生产技术等现有水平上加以主观努力，使之提高，做到增产，而不是以天年的好坏做增产标准。在灾区，必须切实领导群众，兴修水利，积存肥料，修补农具，准备种籽，保证按时播种。
    （四）为了解决农民的困难，刺激与促进农业生产的发展，必须给以必要的投资与贷款，但主要的应该是依靠与发动群众的力量，并开展农村的信用借贷，克服单纯依赖国家贷款的思想。国家的投资贷款，应以老区为主，并只限于对一九五○年增产粮食确实有效的事业，如水利、农具、种籽、防除病虫的药械、种畜与兽医等。
    （五）各地必须保证执行全国农业生产会议上确定的方针与计划。但由于我国地区广阔，土地、气候等自然条件各不相同，工作基础又很不平衡，因此在总的全国性的方针计划下，各地区必须“因地制宜”，拟出适合当地情况的具体计划，并经过自下而上的修正，制订出具体实施的办法，以保证计划的完成。
    计划制订后，最重要的问题就是组织工作。为此，必须进行深入的宣传动员工作，贯彻奖励生产的政策，提倡劳动发家。必须把各方面的力量组织起来，充分运用与发挥有利条件，克服困难，战胜灾害，深入群众把现有的生产办法与经验提高一步，把新技术广泛的运用起来。
