Comrade Representatives:

　　The main item on the agenda for this representative conference is the work plan of the Beijing Municipal People's Government for 1950 and the draft budget of revenue and expenditure of Beijing Municipality for 1950. Mayor Nie has already given a detailed report on the former. Now, on behalf of the Beijing Municipal People's Government, I will give a brief explanation to the conference on the draft budget of revenue and expenditure of Beijing Municipality for 1950, which has already been distributed.

　　First, this draft budget is based on the financial revenue and expenditure situation and experience of 1949, as well as the annual work plans of various departments of the Municipal People's Government. It has been compiled after repeated discussions, revisions, and relatively precise calculations. Therefore, it is based on evidence, close to reality, relatively reliable, and has a considerable guarantee of implementation. However, a budget is ultimately a budget and not equal to a final account. In practice, of course, there will be some changes based on specific circumstances.

　　Second, the basic spirit of this draft budget is: on the one hand, to strive to basically guarantee the completion of the 1950 work plan; on the other hand, to strive to basically achieve financial self-sufficiency, using Beijing's income to cover Beijing's expenses, without remitting revenue to the central government or requesting subsidies from the central government.

　　It should be explained that the 1950 work plan, as Mayor Nie reported, takes vigorously restoring and developing production as the overriding central task, while appropriately developing cultural, educational, and health undertakings that serve the working people, and carrying out municipal construction urgently required by the citizens with emphasis. It is necessary to carry out these tasks. At the same time, when formulating the plan, we have also relatively accurately estimated the financial strength and all objective conditions of 1950, and did not close our doors and blindly proceed according to subjective wishes. It is also possible to carry out these tasks. Precisely because the 1950 work plan is formulated based on necessity and possibility, this draft budget must guarantee its completion.

　　It should be explained that so-called financial self-sufficiency does not mean that it can be achieved only by relying on the income belonging to Beijing Municipality in terms of the fiscal system, but rather that all of Beijing's total income, including the income belonging to the central government in terms of the fiscal system, is used to cover Beijing's expenses, and then it is possible to achieve self-sufficiency. For example, agricultural tax, industrial and commercial tax, and goods tax were originally supposed to be partially remitted to the central government, but now they are all retained by Beijing Municipality. Also, the profit from the liquor monopoly originally belonged to the central government, but now it is also assigned to Beijing Municipality. On the other hand, the project cost of dredging the Three Seas is entirely borne by the central government, and the development of agricultural production, the development of water conservancy, and the undertaking of agricultural reclamation and afforestation also receive great assistance from the central government. This has reduced a large amount of expenditure for Beijing Municipality, which is equivalent to the central government giving Beijing Municipality a large subsidy.

　　Because we compiled this draft budget by adopting the principle of considering both expenditure based on income and income based on expenditure, with particular emphasis on income based on expenditure, and estimated all necessary expenditures and possible income, it is possible to strive for such financial self-sufficiency.

　　Beijing's finances have always been in deficit. Such financial self-sufficiency was impossible in the era of Kuomintang reactionary rule. But we can now achieve it. Is this because we have increased the tax burden on citizens? Absolutely not. We have not only abolished many exorbitant taxes and levies from the era of Kuomintang reactionary rule, but also, in terms of direct taxes, generally speaking, the number of tax items has been reduced and the tax rates have been lowered. How could the tax burden on citizens be increased? Taking the statistics of taxes and levies paid by 19 businesses in 13 industries in Beijing in 1948, which can be used as a representative and typical material, the exorbitant and miscellaneous levies accounted for as little as 29% and as much as 86% of the total amount, averaging 59%! Now that these exorbitant taxes and levies have been abolished, it means that the past burden has been reduced by more than half. The reason why we can achieve financial self-sufficiency is: 1. Public and private industrial and commercial enterprises alike pay business tax. 2. Municipal state-owned enterprises pay profits. 3. Eliminating embezzlement, preventing tax evasion, and ensuring that all taxes and levies are collected. In the era of Kuomintang reactionary rule, citizens bore heavy burdens but the government had little income, honest people paid taxes but cunning people evaded taxes, and ordinary citizens suffered from the disturbance of exorbitant taxes and levies, while those with a little power did not pay taxes, paid less taxes, or delayed paying taxes until the currency had greatly depreciated. Now, these phenomena are gone, and thus tax revenue has also increased.

　　Third, in the total income of this draft budget, tax revenue accounts for 88.03% of the total income. The industrial and commercial income tax and business tax account for 21.24%, which is slightly more than one-fifth. This is compiled according to the amount collected in the first half of 1949 and has not been increased. The business tax of public enterprises (including central enterprises and municipal public enterprises) accounts for 10.11%, which is compiled according to the tasks assigned by the central government. The agricultural tax accounts for 7.42%, which is also compiled according to the tasks assigned by the central government. Other tax revenues account for 49.26%, most of which are compiled based on the estimated monthly income in the winter of 1949. In addition, the profit of municipal public enterprises accounts for 5.06%, which is compiled according to the estimate of the Bureau of Industry. The profit from the liquor monopoly accounts for 4.72%, which is compiled according to the tasks assigned by the central government. The sum of the two is 9.78%. The combined proportion of these two income items and the business tax of public enterprises in the total income is 19.89%. The carry-over from the previous year accounts for 1.01%. Other income accounts for 1.18%. Among them, the income from license fees accounts for 0.67%, the miscellaneous fees of municipal secondary schools account for 0.17%, and the administrative and judicial income accounts for 0.34%.

　　In the total expenditure of this draft budget, administrative expenses, including the expenses of public security organs and the public security corps, judicial expenses, fire protection expenses (the purchase of important fire-fighting equipment will be separately allocated by the central government), subsidies for people's organizations, and democratic construction expenses, account for 27.27%. If the expenses of the public security corps, which are actually the nature of local armed forces, accounting for 5.75%, are deducted, then it is 21.52%. Various operating expenses, including production investment or loans, municipal construction, culture and education, public health, social undertakings, etc., account for 60.45%. Among them, the proportion of production investment or loans is the largest, at 21.81%, including 15.26% for public enterprises, 5.52% for public utilities, and 1.03% for agricultural reclamation. Although production in this city has recovered considerably in the past year, it still needs to be vigorously developed. Therefore, in addition to leading and supporting private enterprises, we should also strive to develop the production of public enterprises. The foundation of public enterprises in this city is weak and the scale is very small. It is absolutely necessary to include a production investment or loan in this budget. However, public utilities can also be said to belong to the scope of municipal construction. The amount of investment or loans purely as public enterprises is slightly less than five-fifths of the three income items: public enterprise business tax, municipal public enterprise profit, and liquor monopoly profit. Secondly, municipal construction costs are second only to production investment or loans, accounting for 19.21%. The distribution of its uses is: 6.83% for the Construction Bureau. It is mainly used for maintaining and repairing roads, maintaining and improving bridges and culverts, etc. Paved roads in this city account for only 23% of the total road surface (excluding small alleys), and most of them have been damaged. The rest are dirt roads. Therefore, we must select and build some large and small roads that connect industrial centers, facilitate public transportation, and meet the urgent needs of the majority of the people, especially the working people. In addition to building or repairing some major traffic arteries, we will focus on building roads in densely populated areas with the worst roads in the working people's gathering areas. With little money spent, many roads are built, and the benefits to the people are also greater. 12.21% for the Hygiene Engineering Bureau. It is mainly used to renovate sewers, fill in stinking water pits, solve drainage problems in working people's residential areas, dredge rivers and lakes, develop water sources, and build sewage ponds, infiltration wells, and public toilets to reduce mosquito breeding and improve citizens' health. Sewer projects require the most money, but this is only the most urgently needed part of the entire project. Because only one-third of the total length of streets in the urban area of ​​this city have sewers. Many streets, especially in working people's residential areas, do not have sewers. Among the existing sewers, most are also silted up and damaged. Usually, sewage accumulates and mosquitoes breed, affecting environmental sanitation. After rain, rainwater cannot be discharged, hindering street traffic. Therefore, within the scope permitted by financial resources, it is necessary to selectively excavate, renovate, and build. Park investment accounts for 0.17%. This is because parks in this city, such as the Summer Palace, the Western Suburbs Park, the Beihai Park, and the Zhongshan Park, all have the conditions to operate and produce to seek self-sufficiency, which saves government expenses and reduces the burden on tourists. Therefore, investment should be made to facilitate turnover. The third largest item in the operating expenses is the culture and education expenses, including general secondary education, vocational and normal education, social education, spare-time supplementary education for working people, cadre training, cultural and artistic work, news and broadcasting work, etc., accounting for 9.94% of the total expenditure. If the expenses of primary schools in urban areas and the expenses of primary schools in suburban areas, which are paid by local funds, are added, then the amount is not small (the proportion of total education expenses in the total budget of municipal and local funds will be discussed later). Public health expenses rank fourth in operating expenses, accounting for 5.84% of the total expenditure. It is mainly used to increase clinics, maternity and child health centers, strengthen epidemic prevention, appropriately increase the equipment and beds of existing hospitals, and entrust public and private hospitals other than municipal hospitals to provide free or reduced-fee medical treatment to poor working people, with the government subsidizing medical expenses. The number of medical and health institutions in this city is very small, and most of them are concentrated in the so-called "rich areas." Therefore, it is necessary to increase clinics and other facilities in various outer city areas where working people gather, and implement reduced or free medical treatment in other areas. The fifth is social undertaking expenses, accounting for 3.00% of the total expenditure, including preferential treatment, evacuation of the population, nurseries, reform of prostitutes and beggars, production and education institutes, and relief for unemployed employees. In addition, there are suburban ditch dredging expenses in the operating expenses, accounting for 0.65% of the total expenditure. The remaining agricultural production loans are the responsibility of the Ministry of Agriculture of the Central Government and the Cooperative Department of the People's Bank, and are not included in this draft budget. In the first half of 1949, operating expenses accounted for only 25.92% of the total expenditure, and the budget for the second half of the year only increased to 40.18%, while this draft budget includes 60.45%. I think all representatives will consider this a progress and express their approval. Financial expenses account for 5.16%, including the expenses of tax authorities, printing costs of bills and receipts, and financial differences. In 1949, due to price fluctuations and poor management, financial differences reached 10% of the total expenditure. This draft budget reduces it to 3.24%. Subsidies for primary school expenses in urban and suburban areas and cleaning and sanitation expenses in urban areas account for 2.25%. These expenses were originally paid by local funds. But in fact, income is not enough to cover expenses. In 1950, in addition to using the surcharges of industrial and commercial tax, real estate tax, and agricultural tax to solve most of the problem, there is still a deficit. Because the burden on suburban farmers is already not light and should not be increased, and the surcharge on industrial and commercial tax and real estate tax in urban areas should not be increased, it is proposed that the municipal finance will allocate funds to make up for the deficit. The reserve fund accounts for 4.87%. In the actual expenditure in 1949, the reserve fund accounted for 16%. This draft budget has greatly reduced its proportion, and most or at least part of the use of these reserve funds will belong to temporary operating expenses. That is to say, most or part of the reserve fund is actually operating expenses, so the percentage of operating expenses is even more than 60.45%.

　　After deducting the above income and expenditure, the deficiency accounts for 3.81% of the total expenditure. This is the so-called deficit. We plan to adopt methods such as work relief and voluntary labor to reduce part of the wage expenditure in municipal construction. At the same time, we will strive to increase the income of municipal enterprises' profits and various taxes to make up for this deficit, and no longer request subsidies from the central government.

　　Fourth, this draft budget does not include local revenue and expenditure. Local income includes surcharges of industrial and commercial tax, real estate tax, and agricultural tax, income from manure disposal, and primary school miscellaneous fees. The total local expenditure includes primary school education expenses in urban and suburban areas, cleaning and sanitation expenses in urban areas, and village office expenses. If local revenue and expenditure are also included in this draft budget, then the percentages in the expenditure will also change. If the reserve fund including temporary operating expenses and other temporary expenses is excluded, then administrative expenses only account for 27.04%, and operating expenses increase to 67.92%. Among the operating expenses, the percentage of cultural and educational expenses and public health expenses has increased significantly, the former increased from 9.94% to 15.40%, and the latter increased from 5.84% to 8.89%, the sum of the two is 24.29%.

　　Fifth, once this draft budget is approved by the conference and approved by the central government, it must be resolutely implemented and thoroughly realized. Because on the income side, all possible income has been estimated, while on the expenditure side, it is limited to necessary expenditures. If the income is reduced or the expenditure is increased, not only will the budget itself be destroyed and financial difficulties will occur, but also the 1950 work plan will be greatly affected. Therefore, we require the staff of various departments of the Municipal People's Government, including ourselves, on the one hand, to practice strict economy, eliminate waste, and not allow any expenditure to exceed the budget, and not make any temporary expenses that are not absolutely necessary; on the other hand, to ensure the completion of the tax revenue task, prevent tax evasion and loss, improve financial management, reduce financial differences, reorganize public enterprises, increase profit income, and not let any income fall through or be discounted. We also require all citizens of Beijing to help and supervise us in the implementation of this draft budget, on the one hand, to help us complete the tax revenue task, and on the other hand, to supervise us on the use of tax revenue, ensuring that what is "taken from the people" must be "used for the people", and what is "used for the people" must also "be taken from the people".

### 张友渔副市长在北京市二届二次各界人民代表会议上  关于一九五○年度北京市财政收支概算草案的报告

专栏：

　　张友渔副市长在北京市二届二次各界人民代表会议上
    关于一九五○年度北京市财政收支概算草案的报告
　　各位代表：
    这一次代表会议所要讨论的主要议题，是北京市人民政府一九五○年度的工作计划和一九五○年度北京市财政收支概算。关于前者，聂市长已做了详尽报告。我现在代表北京市人民政府，向大会对已经印发的一九五○年度北京市财政收支概算草案，简要地做一个说明。
    第一、这个概算草案是根据一九四九年度的财政收支状况和经验以及一九五○年度市人民政府各部门的全年工作计划，经过反复研讨，一再修改，比较精确地计算后编成的。因此，它是有根据的，接近实际的，比较可靠的，实行起来有相当保证的。但概算究竟是概算而不等于决算，在实行中，当然还会根据具体情况，有些变动。
    第二、这个概算草案的基本精神是：一方面，争取基本上，保证一九五○年度工作计划的完成；他方面，争取基本上，做到财政上自给，以北京市收入，供北京市开支，不向中央上解，也不再要求中央补助。
    应该说明：一九五○年度工作计划，像聂市长所报告，是以大力恢复和发展生产为压倒一切的中心任务，同时，适当发展为劳动人民服务的文教卫生事业，以及有重点地进行市民所迫切要求的市政建设。进行这些工作是必要的。同时，在拟订计划时，又曾经比较精确地，估计了一九五○年度的财政力量和一切客观条件，并不是依照主观愿望，闭门造车。进行这些工作也是可能的。正因为一九五○年度工作计划是根据必要和可能而拟订的，这个概算草案就必须保证它的完成。
    应该说明：所谓财政上自给，不是说只依靠财政制度上属于北京市的收入便可自给，而是说，所有北京市的全部收入，包括财政制度上属于中央的收入，都供北京市开支，则可能自给。例如农业税，工商业税，货物税等原应部分上解，现在，都留给北京市了，又如酒专卖利润原属中央收入，现在，也划归北京市了。另一方面，疏浚三海的工程费，完全由中央担负，而发展农业生产，开发水利，进行农垦植林的费用，也得到中央很大的帮助，这就使得北京市减少了一大笔开支，也就等于中央给了北京市一大笔补助。
    由于我们编制这个概算草案，是采取了量出为入和量入为出兼顾，特别着重量入为出的方针，估计到一切必要的支出和可能的收入，争取这样的财政上自给是可能的。
    北京市的财政向来都是入不敷出。这样的财政上自给，在国民党反动统治时代是做不到的。但我们现在却可能做到了。这是不是因为我们加重了市民的捐税负担呢？决不是。我们不仅废除了国民党反动统治时代的许多苛捐杂税，而且在正税方面，一般地说，也是税目减少，税率减轻了。市民的捐税负担怎么会加重呢？试就可以作为一个有代表性的，典型材料的，一九四八年度北京市十三种行业十九家商号缴纳税捐的统计来看，其中，苛杂竟占总额百分之二十九弱到百分之八十六弱，平均为百分之五十九弱！现在，这些苛捐杂税取消了，也就是把过去的负担减轻了一半以上。我们所以能够做到财政上自给，是由于：一、公营企业和私营工商业同样纳营业税。二、市公营企业交纳赢利。三、剔除中饱，防止漏税，一切税捐，涓滴归公。在国民党反动统治时代，市民负担重而政府收入少，老实人纳税而狡黠者漏税，一般市民不胜苛捐杂税之扰，而稍有势力者便不纳税，少纳税，或拖到货币大大贬值后才纳税。现在，这些现象没有了，因而税收也就增加了。
    第三、这个概算草案的收入总额中，税收占总收入的八八·○三％，计工商业所得税和营业税占二一·二四％，即五分之一强，是根据一九四九年度前半年征收数额编列，没有增加；公营企业（包括中央企业和市公营企业）营业税占一○·一一％，是根据中央分配任务编列；农业税占七·四二％，也是根据中央分配任务编列；其他税收占四九·二六％，大部分都是根据一九四九年度冬季每月收入估计编列。此外，市公营企业赢利占五·○六％，是根据工业局估计编列；酒专卖利润占四·七二％，是根据中央分配任务编列；二者合计为九·七八％。这两项收入和公营企业营业税合起来，在总收入中，所占的比重是一九·八九％。上年结转占一·○一％。其他收入，占一·一八％。其中，证照规费收入占○·六七％；市立中等学校杂费占○·一七％；行政司法收入占○·三四％。
    这个概算草案中的支出总额中，行政费包括公安机关和公安总队经费，司法经费，消防经费（购置重要消防器材，由中央另拨专款），人民团体补助费，民主建政费等在内，占二七·二七％。如除去实际是地方武装费性质的公安总队经费所占五·七五％，则为二一·五二％。各种事业费包括生产投资或贷款，市政建设，文化教育，公共卫生，社会事业等经费共占六○·四五％。其中，生产投资或贷款所占比例最大，为二一·八一％，包括公营企业一五·二六％，公用事业五·五二％，农垦事业一·○三％。本市生产在过去一年中，虽已有相当恢复，但还需要大力发展。因此，除领导和扶助私营企业外，同时，应该努力发展公营企业的生产。本市公营企业基础薄弱，规模很小。在这个概算中，列入一笔生产投资或贷款是完全必要的。但公用事业，也可以说是属于市政建设的范围。纯粹作为公营企业的投资或贷款的数目，比较公营企业营业税，市公营企业赢利和酒专卖利润三项收入少五分之一弱。其次，为市政建设费仅次于生产投资或贷款，占一九·二一％。它的用途分配是：建设局占六·八三％。主要用在保养和新修道路，保养和改善桥梁涵洞等。本市已铺装的道路仅占全市路面（不包括小胡同）百分之二十三，且多已破坏，其余都是土路，故必须选择联系产业中心，便利公共交通，适应多数人民特别是劳动人民迫切需要的大小道路修筑一些，即除了新修或补修若干交通要道外，把重点放在修筑人口密度最高、道路最坏的劳动人民密集地区的道路。用钱不多，而修路不少，给予人民的利益也较大。卫生工程局占一二·二一％。主要用在整修下水道，填平臭水坑，解决劳动人民聚居地区排水问题，疏浚河湖，开发水源，修建秽水池，渗水井和公共厕所，以减少蚊蝇繁殖，增进市民健康。下水道工程需款最多，但这还仅是全部工程中，最迫切需要的一部分。因为本市城区街道有下水道的仅占街道总长三分之一。许多街道特别是劳动人民聚居的地区是没有下水道的。而在现有的下水道中间，也大都淤塞损坏。平时，污水积存，蚊蝇孳生，影响环境卫生，雨后，雨水无从宣泄，妨碍街道交通。故在财力许可的范围内，必须择要掏挖，整理和修建。公园投资占○·一七％。这是因为本市公园如颐和园、西郊公园、北海公园、中山公园等都具有经营生产以谋自给，既节省政府开支，又减轻游人负担的条件，故应投资，以便周转。在事业费中占第三位的是文化教育经费，包括普通中等教育，职业和师范教育，社会教育，劳动人民的业余补习教育，干部训练，文化艺术，新闻广播工作等经费，共占支出总额的九·九四％。如再加上以地方款开支的城区小学经费和郊区小学经费，则为数也就不算少了（全部教育经费在市款和地方款总概算中所占比例，后面将要谈到）。公共卫生经费占事业费的第四位，为支出总额的五·八四％。主要用在增设诊疗所，妇婴保健所，加强防疫工作，酌增现有医院的设备和床位，并委托市立医院以外的公私医院对穷苦劳动人民实行免费或减费诊疗，由政府补助医药费。本市医疗卫生机关为数甚少，且多集中于所谓“富贵区域”，故必须在劳动人民聚居的外城各区，增设诊疗所等，而在其他各区，则实行减免费诊疗。第五为社会事业费，占支出总额的三·○○％，包括优抚，疏散人口，托儿所，妓女和乞丐改造，生产教养院以及失业员工救济等经费。此外，事业费中还有郊区疏浚沟渠占支出总额的○·六五％。其余农业生产贷款，由中央农业部和人民银行合作部负责，没有列入这个概算草案。在一九四九年度上半年支出总额中，事业费只占二五·九二％，下半年预算也只增加到四○·一八％，而现在这个概算草案则列入六○·四五％，我想各位代表一定会认为这是一个进步，而表示赞同。财务费占五·一六％，包括税收机关经费，票照印制费和财务折差。一九四九年度，由于物价波动，管理不善，财务折差达支出总额的一○％，这个概算草案则减为三·二四％，城郊区小学经费和城区清洁卫生费补助费占二·二五％。这些经费原是地方款开支。但事实上，入不敷出。一九五○年度，除用工商业税，房地产税和农业税等三项税的附加解决大部分外，还有亏空。因为郊区农民负担已经不轻，不应再加，城区工商业税和房地产税附加也不宜再增，故拟由市财政拨补，预备费占四·八七％。在一九四九年度的实际开支中，预备费占一六％。这个概算草案把它的比例大大减小了，而这些预备费的用途，大部分或至少一部分将属于临时事业费。也就是说，大部分或一部分预备费实际上是事业费，因而事业费所占的百分比，还要比六○·四五％为多。
    以上收支相抵，不足之数占支出总额的三·八一％。这是所谓赤字。我们拟采取以工代赈，义务劳动等办法，减少市政建设费中一部分工资开支，同时，争取增加市营企业赢利和各项税收的收入，以弥补这个赤字，不再向中央请求补助。
    第四、这个概算草案没有包括地方款收支在内。地方款收入包括工商业税，房地产税和农业税等三种税的附加，粪便处理收益和小学杂费。地方款支出总额包括城郊小学教育经费，城区清洁卫生费，村公所开支。如把地方款收支也加入这个概算草案内，则支出中的百分比也就有了改变，如果把包含临时事业费和其他临时开支在内的预备费除外，则行政费只占二七·○四％，事业费增加到六七·九二％，而在事业费中，文化教育费和公共卫生费所占的百分比显著增大，前者由九·九四％，增大到一五·四○％，后者由五·八四％，增大到八·八九％，二者合计为二四·二九％。
    第五、这个概算草案一经大会通过，中央批准，必须坚决执行，彻底实现。因为它在收入方面，是把可能的收入都估计进去，而在支出方面，则只限于必要的支出。如果收入有所减少或支出有所增加，则不仅概算本身被破坏，财政上发生困难，而且一九五○年度的工作计划也将大受影响。因此，我们要求市人民政府各部门工作人员，包括我们自己在内，一方面，厉行节约，杜绝浪费，不使任何一项开支超过概算，不作任何非万分必要的临时费开支；另方面，保证完成税收任务，防止偷漏损耗，改善财政管理，减少财务折差，整理公营企业，增加赢利收入，不让任何一项收入落了空，打了折扣。也要求全北京市市民帮助和监督我们执行这个概算草案，一方面，帮助我们完成税收任务，另方面，监督我们对于税收的用途，务使“取之于民”的，一定“用之于民”，而“用之于民”的，也势须“取之于民”。
