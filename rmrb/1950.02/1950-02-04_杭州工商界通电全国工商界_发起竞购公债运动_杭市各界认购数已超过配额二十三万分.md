Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou, 3rd: The preparatory committee of the Hangzhou Federation of Industry and Commerce sent a telegram to the industrial and commercial communities of major cities across the country on the 1st, initiating a competition movement to purchase People's Victory Indexed Public Bonds. The telegram is as follows:

To the Industrial and Commercial Communities of All Cities Across the Country:

After the Central People's Government issued the People's Victory Indexed Public Bonds, we conducted repeated publicity, education, and discussions among our peers, which led to a further understanding of the significance of the People's Victory Indexed Public Bonds and their relationship with the development of industry and commerce. This inspired the patriotic enthusiasm of our colleagues, triggering a high tide of competitive purchases. We are determined to complete the glorious task of fulfilling the predetermined 1.2 million shares. At the same time, the active leadership of the working class, the enthusiasm of young students, and the exemplary actions of the People's Liberation Army in working hard, enduring hardship, and practicing thrift deeply moved us. At the Third Hangzhou Municipal People's Representative Conference, after listening to the speeches of the representatives, our understanding of the People's Victory Indexed Public Bonds became clearer. Therefore, we proposed not only to complete the distribution task of 1.2 million shares but also to automatically guarantee to strive for an excess of 100,000 shares, reaching 1.3 million shares. Now the over-subscription task has been completed, and we will work harder to continue to promote sales and promptly make payments. We are even more willing to share this with our colleagues in the industrial and commercial communities across the country, to compete with our colleagues in major cities across the country for the purchase of patriotic public bonds, and to learn from you.

Hangzhou Federation of Industry and Commerce Preparatory Committee. February 1st

China News Agency, Hangzhou, 3rd: As of the 30th of last month, all sectors in Hangzhou have subscribed to more than 1,731,000 shares of the People's Victory Indexed Public Bonds, exceeding the original distribution number by more than 231,000 shares.
