　　Stalin - Friend and Mentor of Writers
　　By Y. Ivanov, Translated by Wang Jinling
　　Editor's Note: This article briefly explains Stalin's important ideas on literature and art. As everyone knows, Stalin continued to develop Lenin's principle of partisanship in literature and stipulated that socialist realism is the basic method of creation and criticism in Soviet literature. An important feature of this literature is the high degree of ideology and optimism expressed in artistic images. This optimism is built on a solid confidence in the power of the people. It is particularly noteworthy that in this article, the author introduces new materials on literary and artistic issues from Volumes 11 and 12 of Stalin's Collected Works, which have not been published in the past. It mentions the policy towards non-proletarian literature. Stalin clearly instructed that one should not simply adopt a method of prohibition towards all new and old non-proletarian literature, but rather create genuine artistic works of one's own proletariat to compete with and replace them. Moreover, it is only in competition that the proletariat literature can be formed and condensed. In order to develop proletariat literature, Stalin also instructed: It is extremely important to boldly and unreservedly cultivate and promote young writer cadres from the working people, especially from the masses of workers.

    I

    Soviet literature is increasingly gaining greater prestige not only among Soviet readers, but also among millions of progressive people around the world. It uses powerful artistic images to express the rise and development of socialist society, and to describe the new men and women of this society, the creators of a new life.

    That is the prospect of the future for all mankind.

    Lenin's prediction nearly half a century ago has been realized: "It will be a free literature, serving not a sated heroine, nor the bored, glutted 'upper ten thousand,' but the millions of working people—those who constitute the country's strength, its future."

    One very important factor in Soviet literature's achievement of such remarkable success is the constant care of their friend and mentor—Stalin—for their work.

    Not only the issues of philosophy, political economy, and the strategy and tactics of the working class's revolutionary struggle, but also the basic principles of Bolshevik aesthetics and literary policy were already indicated in the works of Lenin and Stalin before the great October Socialist Revolution.

    The basic principle adopted by the Bolshevik Party in the field of literature is the principle stipulated by Lenin in his historically significant essay "Party Organization and Party Literature" (1905), which announced and specified in detail the principle of partisanship of progressive literature. Lenin convincingly proved that literature can only be "truly free" if it becomes ideological and "openly linked with the proletariat," precisely in contrast to the "pseudo-free" bourgeois literature that supports reactionary interests.

    This essay played an extremely significant role in the formation of socialist aesthetics, tearing apart the masks of the advocates of so-called "free art." It should be remembered that the propagandists of "free art" and all kinds of decadents were rampant in Russia after the failure of the 1905 revolution. Later, Stalin said this about that reactionary period:

    "At that time, a group of fashionable writers appeared, who 'criticized' Marxism, 'overthrew' Marxism, ridiculed and mocked the revolution, promoted deception, and praised degenerate sexuality under the guise of 'personality worship.'"

    Stalin, together with Lenin, waged a relentless struggle against these dependents of reactionary forces who bore the banner of non-partisanship. Stalin exposed the true essence of the bourgeois slogan of non-partisanship, pointing out: "Concealing class contradictions, ignoring class struggle, lacking a clear class stance, opposing tactics, and pursuing chaos and confusion of class interests—this is what non-partisanship is."

    In another essay, Stalin said: "Down with the mask of non-partisanship, long live the clarity of the political line—this is our slogan."

    The principle of partisanship advocated by Lenin and Stalin has become the main factor in the works of proletarian writers. Some of these writers had already emerged, grown, and strengthened before the revolution.

    Everyone knows the enormous influence Lenin gave to the great Russian writer Maxim Gorky. Stalin spared no effort to help the growth of proletarian writers emerging from the working masses, and he gathered them around the Bolshevik Party newspaper he led, *Pravda*.

    "We would like to see," Stalin said in an editorial in the first issue of *Pravda* in 1912, "...workers not only sympathize with but also actively participate in our newspaper. Don't let the workers say that writing is a job they are 'not used to'; worker writers do not fall from the sky—they gradually grow up in the process of literary work. You must engage in this work more courageously. You may fail once or twice, but later you will learn. ..."

    *Pravda* resolutely upheld Stalin's idea. In an essay entitled "Worker Writers" in 1914, *Pravda* appealed to its readers: "Worker comrades, begin to train yourselves to become editors, worker reporters, worker literati... Give the workers a chance! Long live the worker writer!"

    As a result of these efforts, *Pravda* united a large group of proletarian writers around it as its core. Several of them, such as Demyan Bedny, eventually became outstanding Soviet writers. The literary page of *Pravda* was widely loved by the working-class readers. The workers constantly pointed out the importance of this page in their letters and opinions to *Pravda*. According to those who were present at the time, the poems published in *Pravda* were memorized by many workers, who sang them in their favorite tunes.

    The poetry of *Pravda* initially challenged the bourgeois decadent tendencies in literature. It was filled with optimistic belief in the power of the people, and it called on the masses to struggle.

    II

    After the October Revolution, the question of how to build a new socialist culture—new art and new literature—was brought to the fore. Lenin had already designed a broad plan for the development of culture in the first few years of the revolution. Lenin said that in order to create a new culture, it is necessary to cultivate the intellectual cadres of the people, utilize everything best in the achievements of the old culture created by mankind, and build a new culture on this basis.

    Lenin put forward the proposition of cultural revolution, believing that this is very important for making the broad masses gain culture and developing a cultural upsurge among the whole people. Stalin made incalculable contributions to realizing this proposition and developing it further.

    From the very beginning, the Soviet state paid special attention to encouraging the development of the cultures of all nationalities in the Soviet Union. Stalin made great contributions to the development of national cultures when he served as the chairman of the National Affairs Commission in the early years of the revolution. He called on the Communist Party members of all nationalities to do their best to raise the cultural level of the working people and promote their socialist education. He drafted and implemented a series of programs aimed at improving the culture of all nationalities in the Soviet Union.

    All of this yielded results. Talented writers began to emerge from the working masses of various nationalities in the Soviet Union. Even those nationalities that did not have their own written language before the October Revolution began to create their own Soviet literature in their own languages.

    It should be remembered that in the process of socialist construction, the Communist Party, under the leadership of Stalin, was forced to wage fierce struggles against the most heinous enemies of the people, the agents of imperialism—the Trotskyites, Bukharinites, and their followers. The enemies of socialism wanted to mislead the people not only on general political issues, but also in the field of creating proletarian culture and proletarian literature. They supported the poisonous "theory" that it was impossible to build socialism in the Soviet Union, and that the proletariat could not create its own culture, art, and literature, but could only utilize the dregs of bourgeois culture. These were brazen defeatist provocations.

    Stalin exposed the deceptive nature of such anti-people lies. He defined the characteristics of this nascent new culture as national in form and socialist in content, and this profound definition formed the characteristics of the new culture.

    "We are building a proletarian culture," he said. "That is absolutely true. But it is also true that this proletarian culture, which is socialist in content, takes on various forms and expressions among the various nationalities with different languages, customs, etc., who are involved in socialist construction. The content is proletarian, the form is national—this is the universal culture towards which socialism is heading."

    Stalin's definition of Soviet culture opened up unlimited possibilities for the prosperity of the literatures of all nationalities in the Soviet Union, and gave incalculable influence to the entire process of development of Soviet cultures of all nationalities.

    While growing and developing, Soviet literature was forced to wage arduous struggles against many hostile tendencies, which manifested the resistance of the defeated bourgeois literature in various colorful forms. Soviet literature won this struggle not by means of any administrative decrees, but by the fact that it grew into an irresistible creative force.

    The recently published Volumes 11 and 12 of Stalin's Collected Works include his previously unpublished letters to several Soviet literary figures. These letters, written between 1929 and 1930, remind people of the historical environment at that time, and at the same time show how strongly a great national leader, bearing the most important national affairs, was interested in the development of literature. Stalin was very familiar with the situation in literature. He gave the proletarian writers wise advice on how to treat "non-proletarian literature," that is, to create excellent works, compete victoriously with all the waste products that were not needed by Soviet society, and expel them.

    "Of course, it is easy to 'criticize' and demand the prohibition of non-proletarian literature. But the easiest thing cannot be considered the best. This is not a question of prohibition, it is a question of using competition, of creating real, interesting, and artistic plays with Soviet characteristics that can replace them, to gradually drive out the new and old non-proletarian dregs from the stage. And competition is a huge and serious matter, because it is only in competition that we can form and condense our proletarian art."

    In another letter, Stalin raised the important issue of promoting young writer cadres:

    "I think it is time for us to abandon that aristocratic habit of exclusively praising the literary 'aristocrats' who have already been placed on the stage," he said. He continued:

    "We have tens of millions of talented young people who are overcoming all difficulties and working hard to contribute their share to the common treasure of our construction work... One of our tasks is to give these young forces a way out."

    Stalin's instructions include an entire program. On the basis of this program, Soviet writers have achieved remarkable success, and a powerful literature has grown up.

    III

    The unified Soviet Writers' Association was established in 1932, including all writers who recognized the Soviet platform. Shortly after the establishment of the Writers' Association, Stalin had individual talks with many Soviet writers, which had enormous and truly historic significance for the development of Soviet literature. In these talks, Stalin called the writers engineers of human souls and defined the artistic method of Soviet literature as socialist realism.

    This profound, scientific definition illuminated the entire course of Soviet literature's progress and its great prospects, and gave infinitely beneficial influence to the writer's creative efforts and the development of aesthetic thought and literary critical thought. Stalin's maxims on socialist realism became the basis for drafting the theoretical part of the Writers' Association's charter, which became a clear and profoundly creative program, based on Lenin-Stalin's principles of partisanship in literature.

    "Socialist realism," the charter said, "as the basic method of Soviet literature and literary criticism, requires the artist to depict reality truthfully and historically concretely in its revolutionary development. Moreover, the truthfulness and historical concreteness of the artistic depiction of reality must be combined with the task of educating the working people in the socialist spirit and ideologically transforming them."

    "Socialist realism guarantees more possibilities in artistic creation to express originality, to choose various forms, styles, and genres."

    When talking about the goals and tasks of writers under the guidance of socialist realism, the charter states that to truthfully depict the socialism under construction, and to use this to defend the interests of the working class and consolidate the Soviet Union.

    The charter emphasizes the importance of the close and direct connection between the literary movement and the Party's policies and the Soviet government, and emphasizes that writers must actively participate in socialist construction and must conduct close and in-depth studies of concrete reality, because this is the decisive prerequisite for the growth of literature, the growth of literary techniques, and the creation of literary political purpose, ideological content, and practical effect.

    Without profound knowledge of life, true realism is impossible. In the early years of the Soviet government, Lenin advised writers to study "Saturday labor experiences" in order to discover and express the buddings of the new socialist reality. In a letter to Gorky, Lenin said: "If we want to observe, we must observe from below, where we can examine the work of building a new life in the workers' residential areas, in the provinces, or in the countryside."

    In 1924, when Stalin advised the poet Bedny to travel to Baku, he gave him similar advice: "If you have not seen the forest-like derricks on the oil fields, then you have 'seen nothing.' I believe that Baku will provide you with rich material, allowing you to write a work like 'Traction.'"

    The characteristics of socialist literature are courageous optimism, joy of life, and belief in the power of the working class. Lenin wrote in a letter to Gorky in those reactionary years: "It is necessary to conduct a systematic struggle against political decadence, defection, crying, etc." He believed that it was extremely important and necessary to oppose this decadent literature with a literature of optimism linked to the working class's struggle for liberation. Lenin wrote to Gorky about his cooperation with the *Enlightenment* magazine: "...you can only allow democratic novels, not any crying and defection."

    Stalin also considered optimism to be a characteristic of the Bolshevik creed and the Soviet writer's creed. In the aforementioned letter to the poet Bedny, he said:

    "You are now in a 'happy mood,' which is very good. The philosophy of 'world sorrow' is not our philosophy, let those who are about to die and have lived beyond their years be sorrowful."

    Stalin admired precisely those works that expressed the joy of life, and expressed confidence in mankind, confidence in those who overcome all obstacles, the builders and creators of a happy life in the human world. We all know how much he valued Gorky's narrative poem "The Girl and Death." This beautiful narrative poem tells how death retreats before the passion of the girl who defends her right to love.

    Stalin wrote the following comment on a collection of Gorky's works including this poem: "This is more powerful than Goethe's *Faust* (love conquers death)." This sentence points out the most essential and prominent characteristic of Gorky's works—that is, his passionate optimism, which is exactly the opposite of the pessimism of all bourgeois literature, a pessimism that even Goethe could not overcome in that work that reached the peak of his creative activities and also the peak of bourgeois literature.

    The now famous saying was also said by Stalin: "Mayakovsky was and continues to be the best and most talented poet of our Soviet era." The excellence of Mayakovsky's works lies in the high degree of ideological content expressed in sharp poetic lines, partisanship, ardent Soviet patriotism, and joy of life.

    Thus, we can know that Stalin's main requirements for literature are a high degree of ideology and optimism, all of which must of course be concretely expressed in a highly artistic form.

    The primary issue of all literature is the issue of "characters." We know that the main "characters" of modern reactionary literature are thieves, detectives, prostitutes, sex maniacs, mental patients, and murderers. Works like these can only arouse disgust among the Soviet people.

    Soviet literature creates characters belonging to the new people, that is, the characters of the working and creating people, the builders of a happy life. The best characters in Soviet literature, the highest achievements of Soviet literature, are the kind of characters that Stalin said at the First All-Union Congress of Collective Farm Shock Workers in 1933: "Workers and peasants work hard and build factories and manufactories, build mines and railways, build collective farms and state farms silently, create all the good things in life, provide food and clothing to the whole world—these are the true heroes and creators of a new life."

    These men and women are the characters in Soviet literature.

    IV

    In the difficult years of the war, the Soviet people were forced to take up arms to defend their country and the socialist society they had built. Stalin inspired the Soviet people in this struggle and led them to victory.

    Among the vanguard of those who participated in the war against foreign invaders, there was a team of Soviet writers. The works created by Soviet writers during the war concretely manifested the great strength of the people's patriotism and the heroic behavior of Soviet men and women, and consolidated the Soviet people's will to win.

    After the war, the Soviet Union entered a new stage of development—a gradual transition from socialism to communism. Communist education for the working people is of paramount importance in this period, and the task of Soviet literature has been increased.

    Based on Stalin's proposal, the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party has made many important historical decisions on literary and artistic issues in recent years.

    These resolutions condemned those thoughtless, non-political works that crept into literature, art, stage, and screen, distorting the image of the Soviet people and the socialist reality, and formulated a clear and definite aesthetic program that would lead to better creative achievements. These resolutions especially emphasized the fact that the life-giving principle of partisanship is the soul of Soviet literature, and that only when writers are guided in their literary activities by what constitutes the important foundation of the Soviet system, that is, Soviet policy, by the interests of the people, and by the interests of the socialist state, only then can they meet the high demands that the people place on them.

    Soviet writers are faced with a solemn task that requires dedicated effort, that is, to express the new qualities and spiritual wealth of the Soviet people, to explore the new reality deeply and diligently, and to express the future scenery of Soviet society. In order to help the birth of new things, they must whip those remnants of the past that hinder progress.

    All these tasks are inextricably linked to the requirement of steadily improving the level of artistic skill. All these tasks have direct significance for further strengthening Bolshevik literary criticism, because only brave and honest criticism, carefully judging all the advantages of a work, while exposing its errors in ideological content and artistic treatment, can stimulate the progress of literature.

    Zhdanov, this ardent propagandist of Lenin-Stalin's thought, once spoke of Stalin's emphasis on general criticism and special literary criticism. He said:

    "Comrade Stalin teaches us that if we want to preserve our cadres and educate and cultivate them, we should not be afraid of offending anyone, we must not be afraid of brave, principled, honest, and objective criticism. Without criticism, any organization, including literary organizations, will decay. Without criticism, any disease will penetrate deep into the bone marrow, making it difficult to treat. Only brave and frank criticism can help our people improve themselves, guide them forward, and overcome the shortcomings in their work. Where there is no criticism, stagnation and corruption will take root, and there is no room for progress."

    These historically significant decisions on literary and artistic issues have inspired writers and the entire Soviet artistic intellectual group. They have supported the best creative efforts of writers and artists. Greater achievements have been made in all fields of Soviet literature and art, which proves their beneficial influence.

    Molotov said in his speech on the thirty-first anniversary of the Great October Socialist Revolution: "We have the right to be proud of the success of Soviet art, especially the recent success of Soviet literature, which is no small achievement of the Party's leadership and instructions. Our literature, film, and other art departments are being increasingly enriched by many works, in which the characters show the ideological essence of events and the efforts of the people of the Soviet era."

    Soviet writers carefully study Stalin's works, and find an inexhaustible source of ideas in this Marxist-Leninist encyclopedia of life. That is a lighthouse illuminating the road forward.

    Everything best in Soviet literature is connected with Stalin's name, with his thoughts, and with his maxims. Therefore, the best works of Soviet writers are awarded prizes with his name on them every year. In the Soviet Union, this is the highest reward for creative efforts.

　　斯大林——作家的朋友和导师
    Ｙ·伊凡诺夫  作  王金陵  译
    编者按：这篇文章简明扼要地说明了斯大林关于文学艺术问题的重要思想。如大家所知，斯大林继续发展了列宁关于文学的党性的原则，规定了社会主义的现实主义是苏维埃文学的创作与批评的基本方法。这种文学的重要特点是表现在艺术形象中的高度思想与乐观主义。这种乐观主义建筑在对人民力量的坚固信心之上。特别值得注意的是在这篇文章中，作者介绍了斯大林全集第十一卷和第十二卷中的，过去没有发表过的，关于文艺问题的新的材料。其中提到对待非无产阶级文学的政策。斯大林明确地指示：对一切新的和旧的非无产阶级的文学，不能简单地采取禁止的办法，而是创造无产阶级自己的真正的艺术性的作品来竞争和代替它们。而且只有在竞争中，无产阶级的文学才能形成和凝炼起来。为了发展无产阶级文学，斯大林又指示：从劳动人民中，特别是从工人群众中，大胆地、放手地培养与提拔青年作家干部是具有极端重要性的。
    一
    苏维埃文学不仅在苏联读者中，而且在全世界千百万进步人民中日益获得更大的威望。它用充满力量的艺术形象，表现社会主义社会的兴起和发展，描写这个社会的新的男女，新生活的创造者们。
    那是全人类前途的远景。
    列宁在差不多半世纪之前所说的预言是实现了：“那将是一种自由的文学，它不是为一个宴乐无度的妇人服务，也不是为那些倦怠的吃得太饱的‘上层的万把人’服务，而是为千百万劳动人民服务，他们是国家的精华，也是国家的力量和未来。”
    苏维埃文学达到这种卓越的成功，其中有一个非常重要的因素，那就是苏维埃作家们的朋友和导师——斯大林对他们工作的经常的关怀。
    不仅哲学、政治经济学和工人阶级革命斗争的战略战术的问题，还有布尔什维克的美学和文学政策的基本原则问题，都是在伟大十月社会主义革命之前就已经在列宁和斯大林的著作里有了指示。
    布尔什维克党在文学领域中所采取的基本原则就是列宁在那篇有历史意义的论文《党的组织和党的文学》中（一九○五年）所规定的原则，那篇论文宣布了和详细规定了进步文学的党性的原则。列宁使人完全信服的证明了，文学只有成为有党的思想的、“公开地与无产阶级结合的文学，”才是“真正自由的”，它恰好跟拥护反动利益的“伪自由的”资产阶级文学相反。
    这篇论文对社会主义美学的形成起了极其重大的作用，撕毁了所谓“自由艺术”的拥护者们的假面具。应该记得，“自由艺术”的宣传者们和所有各色各样的颓废派们，曾经在俄罗斯一九○五年革命失败之后猖獗一时。后来斯大林关于这个反动时期这样说过：
    “那时出现了一群时髦作家，他们‘批评’马克思主义，‘推翻’马克思主义，讥讽和嘲笑革命，宣扬欺骗，和在‘个性崇拜’的伪装之下歌颂性的堕落。”
    斯大林，和列宁在一起，对这些打着无党无派口号的、反动势力的依附者们作了无情的斗争。斯大林暴露资产阶级的这个无党无派口号的真正本质，指出：“掩饰阶级矛盾，无视阶级斗争，缺乏清楚的阶级立场，反对策略，追求混乱和混淆阶级利益—这就是无党无派。”
    在另一论文中，斯大林说：“打倒无党无派的假面具，政治路线的明确性万岁——这就是我们的口号。”
    列宁和斯大林所倡导的党性的原则，已成为无产阶级作家的作品中的主要因素。这些作家中间有一批是革命以前已经产生，成长和壮大了的。
    大家都知道列宁给予伟大的俄罗斯作家玛克沁姆·高尔基的巨大影响。斯大林不辞劳苦的扶助劳动群众中产生的无产阶级作家们的成长，他把他们聚集在他所领导的布尔什维克党报《真理报》的周围。
    “我们愿意看到，”斯大林在一九一二年在《真理报》第一期的一篇社论里说，“……工人们不止于同情而且积极地来参加我们的报纸。不要让工人们说写作是一种他们所‘不习惯’的工作；工人作家不是天上掉下来的——他们是在文学工作的过程里逐渐成长起来的。你们必须更勇敢地从事这一工作。你们也许会失败一两次，但是以后你就学会了。……”
    《真理报》坚决地拥护斯大林的这个思想。在一九一四年的一篇论文《工人作家》上，《真理报》向读者们呼吁：“工人同志们，开始训练你们自己成为编辑，成为工人记者，成为工人文学家吧……给工人们机会！工人作家万岁！”
    由于这些努力，《真理报》团结了很大一批无产阶级作家们在它周围作核心。其中有几个，例如德米阳·白德尼，终于成为出色的苏维埃作家。《真理报》的文艺版在工人阶级读者中受到广大的爱好。工人们在他们给《真理报》的信和意见里面不断指出这一版的重要性。据亲历其事的人证明，《真理报》所登载的诗歌被许多工人所记忆，他们把这些诗用他们自己喜欢的调子歌唱着。
    《真理报》的诗歌一开始就向文学上的资产阶级颓废倾向挑战。它充满着对人民的力量的乐观信念，它号召群众去斗争。
    二
    十月革命之后，那怎样进行建设新的社会主义文化——新的艺术和新的文学——的问题，是被提到重要的地位上来了。列宁在革命的最初几年中，已经设计了一个发展文化的广泛的计划。列宁说，为了要创造新的文化，必需培养人民的知识分子干部，利用人类所创造的旧文化的成就中一切最好的东西，在这个基础上建立起新文化来。
    列宁提出了文化革命的主张，认为这对于使广大群众获得文化和在全体人民中间发展一个文化的高潮，是非常重要的。斯大林对于实现这个主张和使它更向前发展，有无可计量的贡献。
    苏维埃国家一开始就特别注意到鼓励全苏联各民族文化的发展。斯大林在革命初年任民族事务委员部的委员长时，对民族文化的发展曾作巨大的贡献。他号召各民族的共产党员尽力去提高劳动人民的文化水平，和推进他们的社会主义教育。他起草了和实施了一系列以提高苏联各民族文化为目的的方案。
    这一切都得到了收获。从苏联各个不同民族的劳动群众中产生的有才能的作家们开始出现。甚至那些在十月革命以前没有自己文字的民族，也开始创造出他们本族文字的苏维埃文学了。
    应该记住，在社会主义建设的过程中，共产党，在斯大林的领导之下，曾经被迫对人民的穷凶极恶的敌人、帝国主义的代理者——托洛斯基派、布哈林派、及其徒子徒孙们进行了剧烈的斗争。社会主义的敌人，不仅想在一般的政治问题上，而且想在创造无产阶级文化和无产阶级文学的领域里，使人民迷失方向。他们拥护那种有毒的“理论”，说在苏联建设社会主义是不可能的，说无产阶级是不能够创造出自己的文化、艺术和文学的，只能利用资产阶级文化的渣滓。这些都是厚颜无耻的失败主义者的挑拨。
    斯大林暴露了类似这些与人民为敌的谎言的欺骗本质。他规定这初生的新文化的定义为民族的形式和社会主义的内容，而这深刻的定义就形成了新文化的特性。
    “我们是在建设一种无产阶级文化，”他说。“那完全是真的。但这一点却也是真的，这种以社会主义为内容的无产阶级文化，在那些有着不同的语言、风俗等等的、卷进了社会主义建设工作的各个不同民族中间，采取了各种不同的形式和表现方法。内容是无产阶级的，形式是民族的，——这就是社会主义所趋向的全人类的文化。”
    斯大林的苏维埃文化的定义，给苏联各民族文学的繁荣开辟了无限的可能性，并且对苏维埃各民族文化的发展的整个过程给予了无可计量的影响。
    苏维埃文学一面成长发展，一面被迫对许多敌对倾向作坚苦的斗争，这些敌对倾向用各种五花八门的形式表现着溃败的资产阶级文学的抵抗。苏维埃文学并不是凭借任何行政法令的帮助，却是由于它成长为一种不可抗拒的创造力量的事实，而赢得了这个斗争。
    最近出版的斯大林全集第十一和第十二卷里，包括了他过去没有发表过的给若干苏维埃文学家们的书信。这些信是一九二九到一九三○年间写的，它们使人回想起当时的历史环境，同时可以看出一个担负最重要的国家大事的伟大国家领袖，对文学的发展怀着多么强烈的兴趣。斯大林对文学的情况是十分熟悉的。他在如何对待“非无产阶级文学”的这个问题上给无产阶级作家们以贤明的劝告，那就是要他们创造出出色的作品，胜利地跟那一切为苏维埃社会所不需要的废物竞争，而驱逐它们。
    “当然，‘批评’和要求禁止非无产阶级文学是很容易的。但是最容易的却不能认为就是最好的。这并不是禁止的问题，这是用竞争的方法，用创造出真正的、有趣的和有艺术性的、能够取而代之的、具有苏维埃性格的剧本的方法，来一步一步把那些新的和旧的非无产阶级的渣滓逐出舞台的问题。而竞争是一件巨大而严重的事情，因为只有在竞争中，我们才能够把我们的无产阶级文艺形成和凝炼起来。”
    在另外一封信里，斯大林提出了提拔青年作家干部的重要问题：
    “我想这是时候了，我们应当抛弃那种贵族式的习惯，专捧那些已经被捧上台的文学‘贵族’，”他这样说。下面又继续说：
    “我们有千千万万有才能的青年，他们为了要对我们的建设工作的共同宝藏贡献他们的一分心血，正在排除万难，努力向前……我们的任务之一就是——给这些年轻的力量以出路。”
    斯大林的这些指示包括了一个整个的纲领。在这个纲领的基础上，苏维埃作家获得了显著的成功，一种强有力的文学已经成长起来了。
    三
    统一的苏维埃作家协会在一九三二年成立，包括了承认苏维埃政纲的一切作家们。作家协会成立之后不久，斯大林曾和许多苏维埃作家做过个别谈话，这些谈话对苏维埃文学的发展是有巨大的和真正历史性的意义的。斯大林在这些谈话中称作家们为人类灵魂的工程师，把苏维埃文学的艺术方法定义为社会主义的现实主义。
    这个深刻的、科学的定义，照亮了苏维埃文学前进的整个路程和它伟大的远景，并且对作家的创作努力以及美学思想和文学批评思想的发展给了无限有益的影响。斯大林关于社会主义现实主义的箴言成为起草作家协会章程的理论部分的根据，而那章程又成为一个明确而深刻地具有创造性的纲领，它的基础是列宁——斯大林关于文学的党性的原则。
    “社会主义的现实主义，”章程上说，“作为苏维埃文学与文学批评的基本方法，要求艺术家对现实从它的革命发展中作一种真实的、历史地具体的描写。不仅如此，对现实的艺术描写，其真实性与历史具体性，又必须与用社会主义精神教育劳动人民和从思想上改造他们这一任务相结合。”
    “社会主义的现实主义保证在艺术创作方面有更多的可能来表现独创性，来选择各种各样的形式、风格和文体。”
    在说到作家在社会主义的现实主义的指引之下的目标和任务的时候，章程说明要对建设中的社会主义作忠实的描写，用这个来保卫工人阶级的利益和巩固苏联。
    章程上强调文学运动与党的政策和苏维埃政府之间的密切而直接的联系的重要性，并强调作家们必须积极参加社会主义建设，必须对于具体的现实作密切而深刻的研究，因为这是文学的成长，文学技术的成长和文学的政治目的性、思想内容和实际效果的造就的决定性的前提。
    没有深刻的生活知识，真正的现实主义是不可能的。在苏维埃政府初年，列宁劝告作家研究“星期劳动经验”，以发现和表达新的社会主义现实的萌芽。在给高尔基的一封信里，列宁说：“如果我们要观察，就必须从下面观察，在那里我们可以在工人住宅区、在省里、或者在农村里考察新生活建设的工作。”
    一九二四年斯大林劝诗人白德尼到巴库去旅行的时候也对他提出类似的劝告：“假使你还没有见过油矿上的密林般的起重机的话，那末你等于是‘什么都没有见过’。我相信巴库会供给你丰富的材料，让你写出‘曳引力’这样的作品。”
    社会主义文学的特点是勇敢的乐观主义，生命的欢乐，和对工人阶级力量的信念。列宁在那些反动的年代中写给高尔基的一封信里谈到：“必须对政治的颓废、变节、哭泣等等进行有系统的斗争”。他认为用与工人阶级解放斗争联结着的乐观主义的文学来反对这种颓废文学是极端重要和必要的。列宁关于高尔基与《启蒙》杂志合作的事曾经写信给他说：“……你只能容许民主的小说，不容许任何的哭泣和变节。”
    斯大林也认为乐观主义是布尔什维克的信条和苏维埃作家的信条的一个特点。在上述的给诗人白德尼的信里，他说：
    “你现在是在一种‘快乐的心情’中，这是非常好的。‘世界的忧愁’这个哲学，不是我们的哲学，让那些正要完蛋的和已经活过了他们的年限的人们去忧愁吧。”
    斯大林推崇的正是那些表现了生命的欢乐的作品，和表现了对人类的信心，表现了对那些战胜一切阻碍的人，人间幸福生活的建设者和创造者的信心的作品。我们大家都知道他对高尔基的故事诗《少女和死神》是多么重视。这首美丽的故事诗叙述死神如何在那位维护自己的爱的权利的少女的热情之前败退。
    斯大林在高尔基的包括这首诗的一个集子上写了如下评语：“这比歌德的《浮士德》更有力量（爱征服了死）。”这句话就把高尔基作品的最本质的显著的特点指出来了——这就是他的热情充溢的乐观主义，跟一切资产阶级文学的悲观主义正好相反，这种悲观主义是连歌德在那篇达到他的创作活动的最高峰的、并且也是资产阶级文学的最高峰的作品里也还不能够克服的。
    这句现在已经很著名的话也是斯大林说的：“玛耶可夫斯基曾经是并且继续是我们苏维埃时代的最好的和最有才能的诗人。”玛耶可夫斯基的作品的出色之处，就在于用锐利的诗句所表现的高度思想内容，党性，热烈的苏维埃爱国主义，和生命的欢乐。
    这样，我们可以知道，斯大林对文学的主要要求就是高度的思想和乐观主义，这一切当然必须具体表现在高度艺术性的形式里。
    一切文学的首要问题是“人物”的问题。我们知道现代反动文学的主要“人物”就是盗贼、侦探、娼妓、色情狂者、精神病者和谋杀犯。像这类的作品，在苏维埃人民中只能引起憎恶。
    苏维埃文学创造出属于新的人民的性格，那就是劳动和创造的人民的性格、幸福生活的建设者们的性格。苏维埃文学上的最美好的人物，苏维埃文学的最高成就，就是斯大林在一九三三年全苏联第一次集体农庄突击队员会议上所说的那种人物：“工人和农民埋头苦干，毫不声张地建设工厂和制造厂，建设矿井和铁路，建设集体农场和国家农场，创造生活里的一切美好的事物，把衣食供给全世界——这就是真正的英雄和新生活的创造者。”
    这些男子和妇女就是苏维埃文学里的人物。
    四
    在战争的艰苦年岁中，苏维埃人民被迫拿起武器来保卫他们的国家和他们所建设起来的社会主义社会。斯大林在这个斗争中鼓舞了苏维埃人民，并且领导他们得到了胜利。
    参加对外来侵略者的抗战的先锋队伍中间，有一个队伍就是苏维埃作家们。苏维埃作家们在战时所创作的作品，具体表现了人民的爱国主义的伟大力量和苏维埃男女的英勇行为，巩固了苏维埃人民的胜利的意志。
    战后苏联进入了一个新的发展阶段——从社会主义逐渐转变到共产主义。在这一时期对劳动人民的共产主义教育是头等重要的，苏维埃文学的任务是加重了。
    根据斯大林的提议，联共中央委员会在最近几年关于文学艺术问题作出了许多重要的历史性的决议。
    这些决议谴责了钻进文学、艺术、舞台和银幕的、歪曲苏维埃人民的形象和社会主义现实的那些无思想的，非政治性的作品，制订了引导出更好的创作成绩的明白而确定的美学纲领。这些决议特别强调这种事实：那给予生命的党性的原则，是苏维埃文学的灵魂，而作家们只有在文学活动中被那构成苏维埃制度的重要基础的东西，即是苏维埃政策所指导着，被人民的利益、被社会主义国家的利益所指导着，只有这样才能够满足人民向他们提出的高度要求。
    苏维埃作家是面对着一种需要专心从事的庄严的任务，就是表现苏维埃人民新的品质和精神财富，深刻而勤勉的探求新的现实，和表现苏维埃社会的明天的景色。为了帮助新事物的诞生，他们必须鞭笞那些妨碍进步的过去的残余。
    所有这些任务，都是跟坚实地提高艺术技巧水平的要求不可分地联系着的。所有这些任务，对于更进一步加强布尔什维克的文学批评都有直接的意义，因为只有勇敢的正直的批评，对一个作品的所有优点加以慎重的评判，同时揭发它在思想内容与艺术处理上的错误，才能激励文学的进步。
    日丹诺夫，这位列宁、斯大林思想的热烈宣传者，曾经说到过斯大林对于一般的批评和特殊的文学批评的重视。他说：
    “斯大林同志教导我们，如果我们要保存我们的干部，并且教育和培养他们，我们就不应该害怕得罪任何人，就必须不害怕勇敢的、有原则的、正直的、和客观的批评。假使没有批评，任何的组织、包括文学的组织在内，就会腐朽下去。没有批评，任何病症都会深入膏肓，难于救治了。只有勇敢和坦白的批评才能帮助我们的人民改进自己，引导他们前进，和克服他们工作中的缺点。那里没有批评，那里停滞和腐蚀就会生根，那里就没有进步的余地。”
    这些关于文学艺术问题的具有历史意义的决定，启发了作家们和整个的苏维埃艺术知识分子群。它们支持了作家们和艺术家们的最好的创作努力。苏维埃文学艺术在整个领域内都获得了更大的成就，这就证明了它们所给予的有益影响。
    莫洛托夫在伟大的十月社会主义革命三十一周年纪念的讲演词里说：“我们有权利骄傲苏维埃艺术的成功，特别是最近苏维埃文学的成功，这是党的领导和指示的不小的成就。我们的文学、电影和其他艺术部门是日益被许多作品所丰富着，在这些作品的人物里显示了事件的思想本质和苏维埃时代的人民的努力。”
    苏维埃作家们仔细地研究斯大林的著作，并且在这个马列主义的生活百科全书中找到了永不枯竭的思想源泉。那是一个照明前进道路的灯塔。
    苏维埃文学中的每一种最好的东西都是和斯大林的名字、和他的思想以及和他的箴言相联系着的。所以苏维埃作家的最好的作品每年都得到带着他的名字在上面的褒奖。在苏联这是对创作努力的最高的报酬。
