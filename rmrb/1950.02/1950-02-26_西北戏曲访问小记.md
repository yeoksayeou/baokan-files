A Brief Account of a Visit to Northwestern Opera
Cheng Yanqiu

Mr. Zhou Yang:

    I am sending you a draft of "A Brief Account of a Visit to Northwestern Opera." Please review and correct it!

    Regarding the improvement of Chinese opera, in my personal opinion, I always believe that a comprehensive and detailed investigation, recording, sorting, and comprehensive research should be conducted on the operas of all regions of the country. This will not only allow us to clearly understand our theatrical heritage, but also, as a result of mutual exchange, it will definitely break down old views of being stuck in one's own ways and create a new trend. Last year's trip to the Northwest, due to insufficient tools and staff, only made a preliminary record; of course, I will go again this year to complete it. At the same time, the Northwest authorities, in order to establish a solid foundation for Peking Opera in the Northwest, have entrusted me with this task, which is also my inescapable duty. Once this is completed, I will of course visit various provinces to complete the initial plan.

    Now, I respectfully seek your advice on whether there is a need to expand the scope of this type of investigation? Does the government need more detailed records? If so, please provide a direction and give us some convenience, and we are willing to bravely take on this task.

    With respectful greetings!

            Cheng Yanqiu, February 9th

    On November 2, 1949, we began our first trip to the Northwest. Although we were also prepared to perform on this trip to the Northwest, the more important purpose was to investigate and study various operas and music in the Northwest as reference materials for improving Chinese traditional opera.

    In recent decades, Chinese traditional opera has clearly declined. Many techniques and characteristics have been buried in the graves along with the deceased actors, batch after batch. This is the case with Peking Opera, and it is also the case with various local operas. There are many reasons for this; but under the semi-colonial situation in the past, and in contact with European and American capitalist culture, a wave of blind worship of the West was aroused, and the need to carefully and critically accept one's own historical heritage was lightly overlooked. This cannot be said to be not one of the reasons.

    Some people call the characteristics of Chinese traditional opera "the art of symbolism." In fact, this is very wrong. If we carefully study the history of Chinese drama, we can clearly see that there is no symbolic motive in the composition of Chinese drama performance techniques. Everything originally started from realism; but in the middle, it went through a dance tempering, thus forming a special way. In recent years, many people have tried to infiltrate direct realism into traditional opera, but as a result, new roads have not been opened well, and the original old roads have become blurred. Now it is not too late to realize and turn back as soon as possible. Our intention to investigate the operas of various regions of the country is for this purpose. For example, if a book cannot be obtained, but there are several incomplete copies, it is possible to gather them together to match them. Even if a complete copy cannot be obtained, it will always be more complete than any one of them.

    One source of Chinese drama originated in the Southeast; another source originated in the Northwest. In these two regions, not only did drama originate early, but for many years, the drama industry has been developing very prosperously. Among them, some opera troupes, because they are located in towns with inconvenient transportation and have less contact with the outside world, have preserved many old techniques, which may be what everyone thinks has been lost. This situation is especially common in the Northwest. The reason why we started working from the Northwest first is here.

    We arrived in Xi'an on November 9th. We stayed in Luoyang for one day on the way. We watched a Quzi opera there, which was performed very well; but what is more worthy of recording is their way of life. This troupe is called the "Farmers' Troupe." True to its name, all the actors are mainly engaged in farming. After the autumn harvest and before the spring plowing of the following year, they form a troupe to perform. Not only do they perform, but they also have a temporary shoe-making factory. When the actors are not on stage, they participate in the work. The opera that day was "The Four Scholars." When Wan rescued Yang Suzhen, we went backstage to visit. The actor playing Yang Chun was making shoe soles with many companions. This spirit is commendable.

    After arriving in Xi'an, in addition to performing and socializing, most of our time was spent on investigation and research. Xi'an has too much theatrical material. Our preparations were too inadequate, tools were lacking, and staff was also insufficient, so we only recorded the general outline and some of the main materials, and the rest will have to wait until the second time when we are fully prepared to complete. Originally, we also planned to go to Qinghai and Xinjiang this time to study the drama, music, and dance of various ethnic groups, but this has also been changed to the 1950 itinerary.

    The main opera in the Northwest is Qin腔 [Qinqiang]. Speaking of Qinqiang, one cannot help but think of Wei Changsheng. What did Wei Changsheng's Qinqiang look like? We have never seen it, but judging from books such as "Yanlan Xiaopu," it can be determined that his singing method was very low and soft. The current Qinqiang, however, sings very rough and豪 [hao], which does not seem to be the kind of opera that Wei Changsheng performed back then. At first, we were just guessing like this, but later we accidentally discovered several stone carvings in a dilapidated Liyuan Temple [opera actor's temple], from which we obtained some evidence from the texts recorded on them. This can be said to be an interesting discovery in the history of Chinese drama.

    The current Qinqiang is very popular in the Northwest. It is said that there are more than a hundred opera troupes touring and singing in various cities and towns in the Northwest. If this is true, it is worth noting. The singing method of Qinqiang is similar to the Xipi of Peking Opera, but it is more complicated. The costumes, makeup, craftsmanship, and martial arts also have different routes. Unfortunately, in recent years, the various troupes in Xi'an have become more Peking Opera-ized. To see its true original appearance, it is still necessary to search for it in various remote places. This time, we saw theatrical clay figurines produced in Yang County, Hanzhong, which still preserved the old makeup and helmet forms of Qinqiang, which looked quite unique.

    In addition to Qin腔 [Qinqiang], there is also a kind of "Mihu" opera. It has tunes and sets, and the form is very similar to Southern and Northern tunes. This kind of opera is not only in Shaanxi, but also in Shanxi. The Nanyang tunes of Henan are also of the same origin but different streams. The single-string of Beijing is also passed down from here, but the tones are different due to the different four tones in different regions. The tune names are sometimes different from each other. For example, the "Hawthorn Flower" of Shanxi and Shaanxi is actually the "Nanluo Beigu" of Beijing single-string; the "Gāng Diào" of Shanxi and Shaanxi seems to be the "Ci'er Shan" of Beijing single-string, also known as "Yunsu Diào" and "Gaochang Diào". The reason why it is called "Gāng Diào" may be because "sawing a big vat" uses this tune.

    There are many kinds of shadow puppet shows in the Northwest: there are 遏工 [Ègōng] shadow puppets, 碗碗 [Wǎnwǎn] shadow puppets, 道情 [Dàoqíng] shadow puppets, 弦板 [Xiánbǎn] shadow puppets, and 拍板 [Pāibǎn] shadow puppets. Among them, 遏工 [Ègōng] is the most exquisite, but it is no longer seen. The second is 碗碗 [Wǎnwǎn]. The characteristic of 碗碗 [Wǎnwǎn] is that one actor plays all the roles. This time we saw an old actor whose stage name is Yīgānqí [一杆旗, One Flag], who is now more than seventy years old. Hearing him sing 生 [shēng, male roles], 旦 [dàn, female roles], 净 [jìng, painted-face male roles], and 丑 [chǒu, clown roles] from one mouth, one would never believe it without going backstage to see it. And in addition to singing and dialogue, he also manages one or two musical instruments.

    Northwestern shadow puppets are different from Luanzhou shadow puppets. The two points that are easiest to see are: First, Northwestern shadow puppets use cowhide instead of donkey skin for the material. Second, the shadow puppets in Luanzhou always make people feel flat on the screen; Northwestern 碗碗 [Wǎnwǎn] can sometimes make people feel three-dimensional.

    In addition to shadow puppet shows, there are also puppet shows. Rod puppets are more common and similar to Beijing palace shows. String puppets are very special. The puppets they use are flat pieces of cardboard, with a layer of cotton added on top, covered with cloth, and painted. This form has only been seen in the Nanyang area, but I didn't expect China to have it too.

    If shadow puppet shows and puppet shows are improved, and scripts with good content are written, and their characteristics of being easy to carry and requiring few people are used to organize some touring performance teams to perform in various small towns, it would be a very good educational tool.

    In addition to local operas, there are also many kinds of foreign operas that can gain a foothold in the Northwest. Such as Peking Opera, Ping Opera, Henan Bangzi, Luoyang Quzi, and Shanxi Nanlu Bangzi, all have many audiences. In addition, there is also a kind of Han Erhuang, but it is quite different from the Han tune of Hubei; it is very similar to Peking Opera. There is also a kind of Huaguxi [花鼓戏, flower-drum opera] from Anhui, which used to be very popular, but now it only exists in southern Shaanxi.

    The theater actors in Xi'an belong to fixed groups, unlike the looseness in Beijing. Therefore, it is easy to rehearse new plays. Since liberation, each troupe has competed to rehearse new plays. "Red Maid," "Fish Belly Mountain," and "Poor People's Hate" were quickly staged. According to the investigation, there are six companies that rehearsed "Red Maid," with a total of 136 performances. The performances of the Northwest Peking Opera Theatre are not included. "Fish Belly Mountain" was performed 63 times, and "Liu Hulan" and "Wang Gui and Li Xiangxiang" were also adapted into old operas and staged. In addition, the Yisushe [易俗社], which is famous for rehearsing new plays, also wrote and performed several new plays, such as "Lin Chong's Snow Night Revenge," "Lu Wenlong," and "Xiangmei Temple." The Yuju [豫剧, Henan Opera] Lion Roar Troupe wrote and performed "Reborn Iron," which was very popular.

    In addition to often performing "Red Maid" and "Forty Days in Beijing," the Northwest Peking Opera Theatre recently performed "The Death of Wu Dalang" written by Wang Yida. It reverses the case for Pan Jinlian and writes about Ximen Qing's reliance on wealth and power. In addition, there is also a book written by Shi Tian called "From Kaifeng to Luoyang," which has not yet been performed.

    Currently, one of the most difficult problems for the various theater troupes in the Northwest is the lack of scripts. After returning to Beijing, there was also a consensus here. This difficulty must be overcome as soon as possible. In yesterday's (February 7th) National Federation of Literary and Art Circles conference, regarding the work tasks of the National Federation of Literary and Art Circles in 1950, the first thing mentioned was to organize creation; and to give literary and art workers the necessary and possible assistance to complete their creative tasks. Yes, this step is very important. According to what I have seen, the lack of scripts is due to the lack of people who specialize in writing scripts. Why is there a lack of people who specialize in writing scripts? There are two reasons: First, many people are watching and waiting because they cannot find the theme. This point should be used by the Federation of Literary and Art Circles to come up with more themes to do some enlightening work. Second, the way and amount of compensation that script writers should receive must be stipulated. Because in this way, some people who are interested in writing scripts can dare to give up their original occupations and use script writing as a profession.

    The masses in the Northwest also like Peking Opera very much. But the local Peking Opera troupes are of too low a standard, and the roles are not complete. The situation is supported entirely by the Northwest Peking Opera Theatre. However, the Peking Opera Theatre has recently been transferred to the Southwest, and the Peking Opera lineup is empty. The Northwest Cultural Department plans to set up a drama school under the Opera Improvement Office, which also has a Peking Opera department. At the same time, it is also necessary to organize one or two Peking Opera experimental troupes to tour and perform scripts with new content in various places in the Northwest. Because there are not enough personnel to allocate in that area, and we happened to be in Xi'an, we were entrusted with these two things to help. In order to make the opera improvement work active in the Northwest as soon as possible, we fully agreed. We will return to the Northwest soon. But we are very worried about our lack of ability, so we hope that all parties will often guide and support us. In the work tasks of the National Federation of Literary and Art Circles in 1950, it is mentioned that it is necessary to systematically understand the situation in various places, collect materials, and establish regular communication relationships; to hold a national working conference of the Federation of Literary and Art Circles once, mainly to understand the situation, exchange experiences, and systematically solve the correct relationship between popularization and improvement in the national scope; to promote the establishment of opera improvement organizations in various places, and unite the vast number of old artists to consciously and actively carry out opera reform work. These plans give us a lot of courage. We hope that these will be realized soon. And we also hope that there will be a national magazine on opera improvement.

    1950 is the time when we should start working hard and moving forward.

　　Editor's Note

    In this issue, we published Mr. Cheng Yanqiu's special article on the investigation of local operas in the Northwest and related letters, as well as Comrade Zhou Yang's reply, in order to arouse readers' greater interest and attention in accepting the valuable heritage of national art and reforming old operas. Comrades Ai Qing and Wang Chaowen have pointed out the importance of learning excellent traditional art in their papers, which is also worth noting by readers.

    Due to space constraints, articles such as "A Brief Discussion on Opera Reform" (written by Ma Shaobo) and "From Shang Xiaoyun's 'Ink Dai' to Talk about the Structure, Scenery and Effect Problems of Old Operas" (written by Gan Yu) will be published in the next issue.

    In the "Stalin - Friend and Mentor of Writers" published in this journal No. 36 (February 12), there is a translation that should be corrected, that is, the three words "的政策 [de zhèngcè, the policy]" at the beginning of the third line of the eighth column should be under "和苏维埃政府 [hé Sūwéi'āi zhèngfǔ, and the Soviet government]". The correct full sentence is: "The charter emphasizes the importance of the close and direct connection between the literary movement and the policies of the Party and the Soviet government..."

　　西北戏曲访问小记
　　程砚秋
　　周扬先生：
    奉上“西北戏曲访问小记”稿一件，请阅后删正！
    改进中国戏曲，据我个人的见解，总以为要把全国各地方的戏曲作一普遍而详细的调查，记录整理，综合研究。这样不但对我们的戏剧遗产可以明确认识；并且互相交流的结果，一定还可以打破了固步自封的旧见，而发生一种新的动向。去年西北之行，因为工具和工作人员的不足，记录工作，只做了一个初步；今年当然还要再去一次，以抵于成。同时西北当局为了要在西北建立一个稳固的京剧基础，因而相委，亦属义不容辞。一俟告一段落，当然还要遍访各省，完遂初定计划。
    现在敬谨向您请教，这种的调查，是否还有扩大范围的必要？政府方面是否需要更详尽的记录？如果是，请指示一个方针，给予我们一些方便，我们愿告奋勇来负起这项工作的。
    此致敬礼！
            程砚秋谨启    二月九日
    一九四九年十一月二日，我们开始第一次的西北旅行。这次到西北去，虽然也准备演出，但是更重要的目的，是为了调查和研究西北方面的各种戏曲音乐，作为改进中国旧剧的参考资料。
    近几十年以来，中国的旧剧，显然是下降了。许多的技术和特点，随着故去的演员们，一批一批的埋到坟墓里去。京剧是如此，各种地方戏也是如此。所以然的原因很多；但在过去半殖民地的情况之下，和欧美资本主义的文化相接触，因而激起一阵盲目崇拜西洋的风气，轻率地忽略了应该对自己的历史遗产加以慎重的批判接受，不能不说也是一个原因。
    中国旧剧的特点，很有些人称它做“象征的艺术”。其实这是很错误的。如果我们仔细去研究研究中国戏剧的历史，很明白的可以看出，中国戏剧表演技术的构成，并没有丝毫象征的动机存在。一切原来都是从写实上出发的；但是中间却经过一番舞蹈的陶冶，因而形成了一种特殊的方式。近些年来，许多人都试把直接写实的方法，渗入到旧剧里去，结果新的道路并没开好，原旧的道路也模糊了。现在应该及早觉悟回头，总还不算太迟。我们立意要调查全国各地方戏剧，目的即在此。比如一本得不到的书，却有几部残本在，不妨集拢起来配合一下，纵使得不着全的，但总会比其中任何一本要完整的。
    中国的戏剧，一个来源是起自东南；另一个来源是起于西北。在这两个地区里，不但戏剧起源得早，而且若干年来，戏剧事业一直在很盛旺地发展着。其间很有些戏班，因为处在交通不便的城镇中，和外间较少接触，因而比较多保存下不少旧有的技术，或许正是大家认为已然失去的。这种情形，尤以西北为多。我们首先从西北开始工作，其原因便在此。
    我们是十一月九日到达西安的。路途中曾在洛阳停留了一天。在那里看了一次曲子戏，表演得很不错；但更值得记载的，是他们的生活方式。这剧团名叫“农民剧团”。名符其实地全体演员都是以务农为本业。在秋收之后，来年的春耕以前，他们组成剧团来演戏。不单是演戏，他们还有一个临时的制鞋工厂。演员不上场时，便参加工作。那天的戏是“四进士”。当万氏救杨素贞时，我们到后台去参观。演杨春的那位演员，正在和许多同伴做鞋底子。这种精神是很可佩服的。
    到了西安以后，除去演戏和酬应以外，大部分的时间都是在做调查研究工作。西安的戏剧材料太丰富了。我们的准备太不充足，工具缺乏，工作人员也不敷分配，所以只记录下总的纲领和部分的主要材料，其余的只好等第二次准备充足了再去完成了。本来这次我们还计划到青海、新疆去研究各民族的戏剧乐舞，这一来也改列在一九五○年的行程之中了。
    西北的戏剧，主要的是秦腔。提起秦腔，不由使人联想到魏长生。魏长生所演的秦腔是什么样子？我们不曾看见过，但从“燕兰小谱”一类的书上看来，可以断定其唱法是很低柔的。现在的秦腔，唱起来却很粗豪，似乎不是当年魏长生所演的一类。起初我们还只是这样测想，后来无意中在残破的梨园庙里发现了几块石刻，从上面所载的文字中，得到了一点证明材料。这在中国戏剧史上，可以说是一个有趣的发见。
    现今的秦腔，在西北很盛行。据说一共有百多个戏班，在西北各城市村镇巡回演唱。假使此话不虚，倒是值得注意的。秦腔的唱法，近似京剧的西皮，但比较复杂。服装，化装，做工，把子，也另有途径。可惜西安各班，近年来多京剧化了，要看明它的真正本来面目，还需要到各偏僻的地方去搜求一下。这次我们看见汉中洋县出品的戏剧泥人像，还保存着秦腔旧来的化装和盔头形式，很有些特异的样子。
    秦腔之外，还有一种“迷胡”戏。有曲牌，有套数，形式很像南北曲。这种戏不仅是陕西有，山西也有。河南的南阳曲子，实也是同源而异流的东西。北京的单弦也是从这里流传过来的，不过声调因各地四声之不同而互有歧异罢了。牌名有时也互不相同。例如山陕的“山查花”，实即北京单弦的“南锣北鼓”；山陕的“缸调”，似即北京单弦的“赐儿山”，又名“云苏调”、“高昌调”。所以称为“缸调”，也许是由于“锯大缸”用这调的原故吧。
    西北的灯影戏很多种类：有遏工灯影、碗碗灯影、道情灯影、弦板灯影、拍板灯影各样各色。其中以遏工最高竗，现在已然不得看见了。其次则数碗碗。碗碗的特点是以一个演员来担任全部角色。这次我们看到的一个老演员，艺名叫做一杆旗，现已七十多岁。听他生旦净丑出自一人口中，如果不去后台一看，决不会相信的。并且他除了唱白以外，还兼管着一两种乐器。
    西北的灯影和滦州影不同。最使人容易见到的有两点：一，西北皮影材料不用驴皮而用牛皮。二，滦州影人在幕上永远使人觉得是平面的；西北碗碗，有时竟能使人感觉到是立体的。
    灯影以外，还有傀儡戏。杖头傀儡比较普通，和北京宫戏相似。提线傀儡很特别，它所用的偶人，是一个平面的纸板，上面稍加一层棉花，再蒙以布，彩绘而成。这形式只南洋一带曾见过，不想中国也有。
    灯影戏、傀儡戏，假使加以改良，编些内容好的剧本，利用它们携带方便用人不多的特点，组织一些巡回演出队，分赴各小乡镇去演，倒是一种很好的教育工具。
    本地戏剧以外，外来的戏剧能在西北立足的，也有好些种。如京剧、评戏、河南梆子、洛阳曲子、山西南路梆子，都有多的观众。此外还有一种汉二黄，但和湖北的汉调颇不相同；和京剧反极近似。还有一种花鼓戏，来自安徽，昔年都曾盛极一时，今只在陕南尚存了。
    西安的戏剧演员各有所属的固定团体，不像北京之散漫。所以排演新戏很容易。解放以后，各班竞排新本。《红娘子》、《鱼腹山》、《穷人恨》都很快地就上演了。据调查排演红娘子的有六家，一共演了一百三十六场。西北平剧院演出的还不在内。《鱼腹山》演出了六十三场，《刘胡兰》、《王贵与李香香》也都改编为旧剧上演了。此外以排演新剧出名的易俗社，也自己编演了好几种新戏，如《林冲雪夜歼仇记》、《陆文龙》、《祥梅寺》等。豫剧狮吼剧团编演了《再生铁》颇受欢迎。
    西北平剧院除常常演出《红娘子》和《北京四十天》以外，最近又演出了王以达所作的《武大郎之死》。为潘金莲做翻案文章，写西门庆之倚财仗势。此外还有石天写的一本《从开封到洛阳》，尚未演出。
    目前西北各剧团，最感困难的一个问题便是剧本缺乏。回到北京以后，此间也均有同感。这层困难，是必须早日克服的。日昨（二月七日）全国文联会议中，关于全国文联一九五○年工作任务，首先提到组织创作；并给与文艺工作者以完成其创作任务所必需的和可能的协助。是的，这一步是很要紧的。据我见到的，剧本之缺乏，是由于太缺少专门写剧本的人。专门写剧本的人为什么缺乏？其原因有二：第一，许多人因为摸索不到主题而在观望、等待。这一点应该由文联方面设法多拟出些主题来做一番启发的工作。第二，写剧本的人，是必须规定其应得报酬的方式和数量的。因为这样才可以使一些对于写剧有兴趣的人，敢于舍掉本来的职业而以编剧来作职业。
    西北方面的群众，对于京剧也是很爱好的。但当地的京班，水准都太低，角色也不齐全。支持局面，全仗西北平剧院了。但平剧院最近就调往西南去，京剧的阵容便空虚了。西北文化部方面，拟定在戏曲改进处之下设立一个戏剧学校，内里也有京剧一科。同时还要组织一两个京剧实验剧团，巡回到西北各地上演具有新内容的剧本。因为那方面人事不敷分配，恰巧我们正在西安，便把这两件事委托我们来帮忙。我们为求戏曲改进工作在西北也早日活跃起来，完全答应了。不久我们还要回到西北去。但是我们很顾虑到自己的能力不足，所以很盼望各方面时常对我们指导扶持。全国文联一九五○年工作任务中，提到要有系统的了解各地情况搜集材料，建立经常通信关系；要召开全国文联工作会议一次，主要为了解情况，交流经验，有系统的解决全国范围内普及与提高的正确关系问题；要推动各地成立戏曲改进的组织，团结广大旧艺人自觉地积极地进行戏曲改革工作。这几件计划给予我们不少的勇气。我们希望这些都快早实现。并且还希望有一个全国性的关于戏曲改进的杂志出现。
    一九五○年，是我们应该开始努力前进的时候了。
　　编者按
    这一期我们刊载了程砚秋先生的考察西北地方戏曲的专文和有关的信，以及周扬同志的复信，以引起读者对接受民族艺术的宝贵遗产和改革旧戏曲工作的更大的兴趣与注意。艾青、王朝闻同志在他们的论文中都指出了学习优秀的传统艺术的重要性，也值得读者注意。
    因篇幅关系，尚有“略谈戏曲改革”（马少波作）和“从尚小云的‘墨黛’谈旧剧的结构、布景与效果问题”（甘驭作）等文留待下期发表。
    本刊三十六期（二月十二日）所刊“斯大林——作家的朋友和导师”中，有一处译文应予修正，即第八栏第三行开头的“的政策”三字应在“和苏维埃政府”之下。正确的全句为：“章程上强调文学运动与党和苏维埃政府的政策之间的密切而直接的联系的重要性，……”
