　　Speed Up Mail Delivery Within the City
    Sender's Name and Address Should be Clearly Indicated on Foreign Letters
    [Our Newspaper] In order to improve postal efficiency, the Beijing Postal Administration had previously increased the number of ordinary mail deliveries to four times a day. After further research, measures have been taken to accelerate mail delivery within the city. Thanks to the efforts of staff in relevant departments, it is now possible to deliver mail deposited at various post offices or placed in mailboxes within the city before 2:30 PM on the same day.
    [Another News Item] The post office has recently discovered that senders often fail to provide detailed sender's name and address information on letters sent abroad, making it impossible to return mail that cannot be delivered. According to the Paris International Postal Convention, the sender's name and address should be written on the front of the envelope, to the left of the recipient's address, or on the back of the envelope. All senders are requested to take note of this.

　　本市邮件加快
    国外信件应注明寄件人姓名地址
    【本报讯】北京邮政管理局为了提高邮政效率，曾将普通邮件投递次数增至每日四次，兹又经研究将本市互寄的邮件设法加速，由于相关各部门工作人员的努力，现已作到凡是在下午两点半以前交到本市各邮局或投入本市各信筒信箱的邮件，当天都可送到。
    【又讯】邮局近来发现各地对于寄往国外信件往往不将寄件人姓名地址详细书明，以致遇有邮件不能投递时，无法退回。按巴黎国际邮政公约曾规定寄件人的姓名地址，应写在信封正面或写在收件人地址左端或信封背面，务请各寄件人注意。
