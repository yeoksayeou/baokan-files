Beijing News: The Yanjing Paper Mill in Beijing signed connection contracts between workshops on the 15th of this month, enabling further connections between departments, ensuring the completion of production tasks, and improving workers' enthusiasm for production, laying the foundation for the signing of collective contracts.

Although the factory greatly increased labor productivity through three production competitions last year (comparing March and December of last year, the average daily paper production increased from 147 reams to 289 reams, and the average time required per ream of paper decreased from 18.7 minutes to 9.1 minutes), the shortcomings of insufficient connection between workshops have not been completely overcome. For this reason, the idea of signing a connection contract was conceived at the end of January this year to ensure the completion of production tasks. Recently, after discussion and research by various departments, it was decided to hold a signing conference for the connection contract on the 15th of this month. At the signing conference, the party, government, and labor union leaders of the factory attended and spoke; the leaders of each labor union group and the heads of each shift signed the contract. Shi Yuzhen, the director of the labor union, said: This time, everyone knows their tasks more clearly, and disputes between departments can also be avoided. The main provisions of the contract are: the raw materials department guarantees that the materials are selected cleanly, without any iron wires, threads, cloth strips, and other debris; the pulping department guarantees that the ingredients are accurately and appropriately mixed, and the pulp must be beaten finely and evenly; the paper-making department guarantees that there are as few pinholes as possible, the texture is even, and the total number of damaged paper does not exceed 7.5% of the completed amount (including the paper cutting and coal drying parts), and the paper stacking must be of the correct size; the finishing department guarantees that the counting and weighing are accurate, and the paper that can be cut into folio sheets should be selected as much as possible; the electrical engineering department guarantees to inspect the motors once a week and supply sufficient voltage; the repair department guarantees that the paper machine does not have major problems when running at 7.5 revolutions per minute or less, and various repair projects are completed according to plan; the boiler room guarantees sufficient steam and the coal consumption does not exceed the quota; the office guarantees to check and publish the results at any time, and prepare the required materials with suitable quality. In addition, the contract also stipulates common conventions regarding work systems and savings, and stipulates that "if there is any violation of the matters stipulated in the contract, the departments will jointly consult, determine the punishment methods according to the severity of the violation, and submit them to the factory management committee for processing."

The administrative side of the factory also formulated a draft reward method at the same time as the connection contracts were signed in various workshops. For example, the quota for substandard finished products is 3%. If the substandard products are reduced to 1%, and the texture is even and there are few pinholes, each person will be given an additional 30 jin of millet.

　　京市燕京造纸厂
　　订立车间联系合同
    提高工人生产积极性
    【北京讯】燕京造纸厂于本月十五日订立了各车间的联系合同，使各部间能进一步联系，保证完成生产任务，并提高了工人生产积极性，为订立集体合同打下基础。
    该厂虽在去年经过三次生产竞赛，大大提高了劳动生产率（拿去年三月和十二月来比，平均日产纸量从一百四十七令增加到二百八十九令，每令纸平均所需的时间从十八点七分减到九点一分），但各车间联系不够的缺点，还未能完全克服。为此，本年一月底就酝酿订立联系合同，以保证完成生产任务。最近各部门又经过讨论和研究，遂决定在本月十五日举行订立联系合同签字大会。在签字大会上，该厂党、政、工负责人都出席讲话；各工会小组长和各班班长，都在合同上签了字。工会主任石玉珍说：这回大家更明确知道了自己的任务，各部间的纠纷也可以避免了。合同的规定主要是：原料部保证料子择得干净，不带一点铁丝、线、布条等杂物；打浆部保证配料准确合适，浆要打得细匀；抄纸部保证砂眼尽量少，质地匀，损纸总数不超过完成量的百分之七点五（连裁纸、煤烘部分在内），码纸要尺寸对；完成部保证过数和过磅准确，把能裁成对开的纸尽量挑出；电工部保证每星期检查马达一次，供给足够的电压；修理部保证抄纸机每分钟开七转半以下不出大毛病，各项修理工程按计划完成；锅炉房保证汽足，用煤不超过定额；办公室保证随时检查和发表成绩，备妥质量合适的需用物料。此外，合同上还订有有关工作制度和节约的共同公约，并规定“如有违反合同所订事项，各部联合会商，分别轻重，决定处分办法，提交工厂管理委员会处理”。
    该厂行政方面，也在各车间订联系合同的同时，订出奖励办法草案。例如不合规格的成品的定额是百分之三，如不合格的减到百分之一，而且质地匀、砂眼少，就每人加小米三十斤。
