Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, February 4th: The full text of the "Report on the Work Tasks of the East China Military and Political Committee" by Rao Shushi, Chairman of the East China Military and Political Committee, at the first meeting of the East China Military and Political Committee is as follows:

The Chinese People's War of Liberation is about to achieve complete victory, and all the mainland of East China has also been liberated successively. However, the reactionary forces at home and abroad will never accept their demise willingly. American imperialists are directing and assisting the Kuomintang remnants in Taiwan and coastal islands to prepare for stubborn resistance, bombing and blockading Shanghai and the people of East China, and vainly attempting to use Taiwan as a base to plot a resurgence; at the same time, our internal and external enemies are creating various conspiracies and tricks, attempting to infiltrate our East China interior to engage in sabotage activities. This is the basic objective situation in East China at present.

Although the old liberated areas of East China, such as Shandong and parts of northern Jiangsu and northern Anhui, have completed the tasks of land reform and democratic reform, the vast new liberated areas of East China, especially the Jiangsu and Zhejiang regions centered on Shanghai, were once the strongest fortresses of imperialist aggression and enslavement of the Chinese people for over a century, and the main bases for the Kuomintang reactionaries' rule and exploitation of the Chinese people for over two decades. Precisely for this reason, many major cities in the new East China area were not built on a sound and independent economic foundation, but on the foundation of the combination of imperialism and comprador-bureaucrat capital, forming a special state of deformed development. At the same time, also due to this reason, the economy of the vast rural areas of the new East China area (especially the rural areas in the triangle of southern Jiangsu, Hangzhou, and Nanjing) more significantly presents a complex form of mutual combination and mutual infiltration of imperialism, bureaucrat capitalism, and rural feudal forces, but basically it has not changed the semi-feudal nature of the general rural economy. These are the basic characteristics of the urban and rural economy of the new East China area.

Starting from the above-mentioned basic objective situation and the basic characteristics of the new area economy, what should be the general task of our East China Military and Political Committee's work in the future? The general task of our work in the future should be to concentrate all forces to resolutely eliminate the remaining enemies inside, and to struggle for the liberation of Taiwan and the completion of the liberation of the whole country; it should be to transform the many old cities of East China that used to serve imperialism and bureaucrat capitalism and depend on the imperialist economy for survival and deformed development into new cities that engage in domestic production, serve the people, and are truly sound and prosperous; it should be to transform the feudal, impoverished, and backward old rural areas in the vast new areas into democratic, prosperous, and progressive new rural areas; and it should be to widely develop the construction of people's democratic power and struggle for the construction of a new East China.

Now, we will explain the above-mentioned work tasks of the East China Military and Political Committee in the future in five aspects:

(1) Military Aspect

We must first concentrate all our forces to eliminate the remaining enemies and fight for the liberation of Taiwan and the completion of the liberation of the whole country. The task of liberating Taiwan and completing the liberation of the whole country is not only the most effective way to smash the continuous bombing and armed blockade by imperialists and the Kuomintang remnants, but also a necessary condition for guaranteeing long-term peaceful construction in East China and the whole country.

However, it must be pointed out that liberating Taiwan is a serious combat task. Our East China People's Liberation Army must continue to carry forward the spirit of heroic and tenacious fighting in the past, and must carry out full preparations; we must avoid arrogance and underestimation of the enemy, and we must avoid relaxation and negligence. The people of East China should make the greatest efforts to support the front line. We must overcome various difficulties in supporting the front line, strengthen logistics and transportation, and strengthen medical work to effectively ensure the supply and medical care of the front-line troops.

We must strengthen the work of the garrison troops and public security troops, and strengthen the organization and education of local armed forces and militia, resolutely eliminate all bandits and secret agents, and consolidate the rear.

Local people's governments must properly resettle and regularly care for disabled and demobilized soldiers, and must effectively care for and give preferential treatment to the families of revolutionary martyrs and revolutionary soldiers who have difficulties in their lives.

East China is located on the front line of national defense, and the coastline is long. In order to defend the motherland and defend peaceful construction, it is particularly necessary to strengthen the construction of the troops. We should strengthen the technical and cultural education of the troops, strengthen political work, and improve the quality of cadres. We should quickly complete the glorious task assigned to us by the Central People's Government of building the navy and air force.

In order to overcome difficulties and improve the lives of the troops, all People's Liberation Army and public security forces, except those performing combat tasks, should without exception follow Chairman Mao's instructions, actively participate in production and construction work, and work with the local masses.

(2) Land Reform Aspect

Article 27 of the Common Program clearly stipulates: "Land reform is a necessary condition for developing the productive forces and national industrialization. In areas where land reform has been implemented, the ownership of land already obtained by farmers must be protected. In areas where land reform has not yet been implemented, farmers must be mobilized, peasant organizations must be established, and land must be distributed through steps such as eliminating bandits and local tyrants, reducing rent and interest, and distributing land to realize 'land to the tiller'." The people of East China should strive for the thorough realization of this provision of the Common Program.

Land reform must be carried out in a prepared and step-by-step manner, and must be closely combined with the restoration and development of agricultural production. Therefore, in areas where land reform has been implemented, land ownership should be quickly determined and land certificates issued. In areas where the conditions for land reform are not yet complete, farmers should be quickly mobilized, peasant associations should be established, and the policies of suppressing bandits, opposing local tyrants, reducing rent, and reasonable burden should continue to be implemented to actively prepare the necessary conditions for land reform. In areas where social order has been stabilized, the broad masses of farmers have been organized, the district and township governments have been transformed, and the leadership is confident, land can be distributed. After this autumn, land distribution should begin in areas where land reform preparation work has been completed. Areas where land reform has not been implemented before the spring of next year can be left until after the autumn of next year to complete it. In short, we must make every effort to complete land reform in all provinces of East China (except Taiwan) within the next two years.

We should tell every working farmer to understand that land reform must be carried out in an orderly manner, otherwise it will not only hinder production, but also be in danger of being sabotaged and disrupted by the enemy. Therefore, whether in the period of preparing for land reform or in the process of carrying out land reform, we must resolutely oppose the erroneous tendencies of indiscriminate beating, killing, arresting, and fining; we must resolutely protect the interests of middle peasants and well-to-do middle peasants; we must resolutely not infringe upon industry and commerce, including the industry and commerce operated by landlords and old-style rich peasants; we must resolutely cherish the revolutionary young intellectuals from landlord and rich peasant families; we must resolutely unite all enlightened gentry who support land reform; we must resolutely correct the deviations and errors that occurred in the process of rent reduction and collection of public grain.

We should make every landlord and old-style rich peasant know that the implementation of land reform and the elimination of the feudal exploitation system is to transform the socially parasitic landlord elements into people who participate in labor production and are useful to society. Therefore, the government will be lenient to all landlords and old-style rich peasants who abide by government laws and have contributed to the protection of farming cattle and farm implements, and will guarantee that they will receive enough land and property to maintain their livelihoods when land is distributed in the future. However, all landlords and old-style rich peasants who illegally transfer land, slaughter farming cattle, destroy farm implements, cut down trees, dismantle and sell houses, slack off in production, or bribe cadres and buy over peasants in any way to undermine land reform will be severely punished.

At the same time, we must make every government worker, every commander and fighter of the People's Liberation Army, and every rural work cadre know that it is the duty of every government worker, every commander and fighter of the People's Liberation Army, and every rural work cadre to support the just demands of farmers for land reform and to represent the interests of the working farmers. Therefore, it is not allowed to embezzle the fruits, it is not allowed to distribute the fruits too much, and it is not allowed to accept bribes in any form, otherwise they will not only be separated from the masses and suffer the opposition of the people, but also violate the laws of the People's Government. They will be punished. (⑵⑶)

(3) Economic Aspect

The people of East China have taken over a large number of bureaucrat-capitalist enterprises from the hands of the Kuomintang reactionary warlords and bureaucrats. At the same time, a large number of private enterprises are owned in major and medium-sized cities in East China. This is a favorable condition for the East China economy. However, these public and private enterprises suffered extensive war damage before liberation, and after liberation, they were also hampered by enemy blockades; at the same time, the rural areas of East China have been devastated by the enemy's key offensives, and suffered from serious floods last year; in addition, the task of liberating Taiwan and supporting the front lines is heavy; the wounds of war are deep and need to be healed urgently; most of the enterprises taken over from the Kuomintang in the past are economic institutions of bureaucrats and compradores who rely on imperialism, and must undergo a long period of transformation before they can be suitable for the requirements of the new democratic economy - these are all temporary unfavorable conditions for the East China economy.

In order to gradually restore, transform, and develop the economy of East China in a planned way, we must resolutely rely on the working class, strengthen trade union work, give full play to the enthusiasm and creativity of the broad masses of workers and staff, practice strict economy in production, overcome various wastes, reduce production costs, and gradually improve the living standards of workers from the development of production, and gradually implement labor insurance and collective welfare undertakings for workers; we must follow Chairman Mao's instructions and resolutely implement the policies of giving consideration to both public and private interests, benefiting both labor and capital, mutual assistance between urban and rural areas, and internal and external exchanges, in order to achieve the goals of developing production and prospering the economy.

In agriculture, we should build water conservancy projects, prevent floods and droughts, provide disaster relief and prepare for famine, increase grain production, expand cotton planting, actively cultivate wasteland, develop sideline occupations, promote afforestation, and strive to restore agricultural production to pre-war levels in the shortest possible time. In coastal areas, we should rectify the salt industry, restore fisheries, and gradually improve the lives of salt farmers and fishermen. In all small and medium-sized cities and rural areas, troops, schools, and institutions should universally launch agricultural production movements.

In industry, we should rationally adjust the supply of raw cotton and other raw materials, restore and develop East China's existing textile industry and other light industries that are beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood, and focus on restoring and developing mining and heavy industry; we should actively transform state-owned enterprises according to the principles of enterprise-oriented production and democratic management, resolutely protect all private enterprises that are beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood, encourage private capital to invest in and increase capital in such enterprises; and we should encourage and assist the relocation of some public and private factories in Shanghai under possible and necessary conditions.

In finance, we should encourage people's savings, facilitate overseas remittances, channel social idle funds into production, strictly prohibit financial speculation.

In trade, we should encourage the exchange of goods between urban and rural areas, regulate supply and demand, stabilize prices, protect legitimate commerce, strictly crack down on speculative commerce, implement foreign trade control, and encourage import and export trade that is beneficial to domestic economic development.

In transportation, we should rapidly restore railways, shipping, highways, postal and telecommunications undertakings, improve their management, and improve their efficiency. In order to meet the needs of liberating Taiwan and facilitate military and civilian transportation, we should plan to increase transportation equipment, open up new routes, and develop private shipping.

In cooperative undertakings, we should encourage and support the broad masses of working people to develop cooperative undertakings based on the principle of voluntariness, first develop supply and marketing cooperatives and consumer cooperatives, and gradually extend to transportation, credit, production, and other cooperatives.

In finance, we should implement fiscal unity, implement budget and final accounts systems, implement reasonable burdens, organize taxes and public grain, ensure the completion of the tasks of public grain taxes and public bonds assigned to East China by the central government, practice strict streamlining and economy, oppose corruption and waste, and accumulate funds to ensure the supply of the People's War of Liberation and necessary undertakings.

(4) Political Aspect

In order to eliminate the remaining forces of the reactionaries, suppress counter-revolutionary activities, resolutely implement the freedom of thought, speech, publication, assembly, association, communication, personal freedom, residence, migration, religious belief, and demonstration of the people, and implement gender equality and freedom of marriage, we must consolidate and strengthen the people's democratic dictatorship.

The People's Representative Conference is the basic form of people's democratic power before the convocation of the People's Congress. It is the best organizational form for connecting with the masses, strengthening unity, promoting work, and overcoming difficulties. Its organizational components should include representatives of the working class, the peasant class, revolutionary soldiers, intellectuals, the petty bourgeoisie, the national bourgeoisie, ethnic minorities, overseas Chinese, and other patriotic democratic people. The people's governments throughout East China must earnestly, quickly, and universally implement the Organizational Rules for People's Representative Conferences of All Circles in Provinces, Cities, and Counties passed by the Central People's Government Committee. Every city with a population of more than 30,000 and every county must convene a People's Representative Conference of All Circles once every three months. All provinces and administrative regions in East China, except for Taiwan, which is still awaiting liberation, must all convene a Provincial People's Representative Conference once in 1950. The East China Military and Political Committee should convene an East China People's Representative Conference of All Circles in accordance with the provisions of the Organizational Rules for People's Government Committees of Greater Administrative Regions as soon as conditions permit, and exercise the functions and powers of the People's Congress and produce the East China People's Government Committee.

All districts and townships below the county level should universally convene peasant representative conferences, implement the transformation of district and township governments, abolish the Baojia system; train advanced elements among workers, peasants, women, and young intellectuals to participate in the work of the People's Government, and improve the quality of cadres working in the government.

We must strengthen public security work and judicial work, and transform old prisons. We should focus on evidence rather than confessions when handling cases, and strictly prohibit torture. The execution of prisoners must be approved by a certain government.

We must implement simplification of administration and improve work efficiency so that the People's Government can more closely connect with people of all strata. We should promote the revolutionary work style of serving the people with integrity, diligence, and simplicity in the people's government, severely punish corruption, prohibit waste, and oppose the bureaucratic style of commandism and detachment from the masses. People's supervision organs should be established in people's governments at all levels above the county and city levels to strengthen the people's supervision of the government.

We must effectively protect all foreign nationals who abide by the law; however, those who violate the laws of the People's Government must be given due punishment.

(5) Cultural, Educational, and Health Aspects

We should carry out cultural and educational work in East China in accordance with the Central People's Government's policy of "improving the people's cultural level, cultivating talents for national construction, eliminating feudal, comprador, and fascist ideas, and developing ideas that serve the people."

We should actively transform public and private schools, improve the quality of teaching, unite and transform original teachers; we should implement universal education in a planned and step-by-step manner to eliminate illiteracy; we should strengthen secondary education and higher education, pay attention to technical education and production education, strengthen the spare-time education of workers and the in-service education of cadres; we should strengthen and expand the East China People's Revolutionary University, educate a large number of young intellectuals and train a large number of worker-peasant cadres to meet the needs of revolutionary work and national construction; we should mobilize a large number of young intellectuals to go to the countryside to participate in rural cultural and educational work and promote land reform.

We should advocate that literature and art serve the people, unite and transform old cultural and artistic workers, and reward excellent literary and artistic works; we should develop the people's film and drama undertakings in a planned way; we should advocate social sciences and natural sciences, and reward scientific works and inventions.

We should strengthen the leadership of public news agencies, newspapers, periodicals, radio stations, and bookstores, and actively guide private newspapers, radio stations, and bookstores to report true news and publish books and reading materials that are beneficial to the people.

We should promote health and health care, guide the people in various places to carry out epidemic prevention and health movements, and pay attention to protecting the health of mothers and infants.

We should pay attention to the exchange of Chinese and Soviet culture, introduce the achievements and experiences of Soviet construction, and strive to consolidate and develop the friendly unity of the people of China and the Soviet Union.

The basic environment and situation we are currently in are: on the one hand, we have already achieved unprecedented great victories in Chinese history; but on the other hand, we still face serious difficulties that we need to overcome. As Chairman Mao said: "Imperialists and domestic reactionaries will never be reconciled to their defeat, and they will make a final struggle. After the country is pacified, they will still engage in sabotage and disruption in various ways, and they will try to restore capitalism in China every day and every hour. This is inevitable and there is no doubt about it, we must not relax our vigilance." But we must also point out that the difficulties we face are difficulties in development and victory. We have the correct leadership of Chairman Mao, the Central People's Government, and the Chinese Communist Party; we have the unprecedented great unity of the working class, the peasant class, the petty bourgeoisie, the national bourgeoisie, overseas Chinese, ethnic minorities, and all patriotic democratic people; we have the support of fraternal administrative regions; we have more than 20 years of experience in hard struggle to overcome all difficulties; we have the sympathy and assistance of our great friendly country, the Soviet Union, and the new democratic countries and the working people of all countries around the world. As long as we can unite, follow the correct policies and strive hard, guard against arrogance and rashness, learn modestly, carry forward our strengths, overcome our shortcomings, maintain a hard-working style, and always closely connect with the masses, we will certainly be able to overcome difficulties, win the liberation of all of East China and all of China, and complete the glorious task of building a new East China.

　　华东军政委员会主席饶漱石
    关于华东军政委员会工作任务的报告
    【新华社上海四日电】华东军政委员会主席饶漱石在华东军政委员会第一次会议上的《关于华东军政委员会工作任务的报告》全文如下：
    中国人民解放战争即将全部取得胜利，我华东全部大陆亦已先后获得解放。但国内外反动派是决不会自甘死亡的。美国帝国主义者正在指挥和援助国民党残匪在台湾及沿海各岛屿准备顽抗，向我上海和华东人民进行轰炸及封锁，并妄想以台湾做基地，图谋死灰复燃；同时，我内外敌人正在制造各种阴谋毒计，企图打进我华东内部来从事破坏活动。这便是目前华东的基本客观形势。
    虽然我华东老解放区如山东及苏北、皖北的一部，已经完成了土地改革及民主改革的任务，但华东广大新解放区，特别是以上海为中心的江浙地区，却曾经是帝国主义者百余年来侵略与奴役中国人民的最坚强的堡垒，及国民党反动派二十余年来统治和压榨中国人民的主要基地。正由于这个原因，所以华东新区许多主要城市，过去不是建立在独立自主的健全的经济基础之上，而是建筑在帝国主义、买办官僚资本相互结合的基础之上，形成一种特殊的畸形发展状态。同时，也由于这个原因，使华东新区广大农村（特别是江南沪杭宁三角地区的农村）经济，更显著地表现为帝国主义、官僚资本主义与农村封建势力互相结合互相渗透的错综复杂的形态，但基本上并未改变一般农村经济的半封建性质。这便是华东新区城乡经济的基本特点。
    从上述基本客观形势与新区经济的基本特点出发，那末，我们华东军政委员会今后工作的总任务应当是什么呢？我们今后工作的总任务应当是集中一切力量，坚决肃清内部残余敌人，并为解放台湾及完成解放全国的任务而斗争；应当是把过去替帝国主义、官僚资本主义服务并依赖帝国主义经济而生存而畸形发展的许多华东旧城市，改造成为国内生产，为人民服务，与真正健全繁荣的新城市；应当是把广大新区中封建的、贫困的、落后的旧农村，改造成为民主的、繁荣的、进步的新农村；应当是广泛展开人民民主政权的建设，为建设一个新华东而斗争。
    现在，我们把上述华东军政委员会今后的工作任务，分作五个方面来说明：
  （一）军事方面
    我们必须首先集中一切力量，肃清残余敌人，为解放台湾及完成解放全国的任务而斗争。解放台湾及完成解放全国的任务，不但是粉碎帝国主义和国民党残余势力不断轰炸与武装封锁的最有效的办法，而且也是保障华东及全国进行长期和平建设的必要条件。
    但必须指出，解放台湾是一个严重的战斗任务。我华东人民解放军必须继续发扬过去英勇顽强作战的精神，并须进行充分的准备工作；切忌骄傲轻敌，切忌松懈疏忽。我华东人民应以最大的努力来进行支援前线的工作。我们必须克服支援前线工作中的各种困难，加强兵站运输，加强医务工作，以切实保证前方部队的供给和医疗。
    我们必须要加强警备部队与公安部队的工作，及加强地方武装与民兵的组织和教育，坚决肃清一切土匪特务，巩固后方。
    各地人民政府对残废军人与退伍军人必须适当安置和经常关心，对革命烈士与革命军人的家属生活困难者必须切实照顾和优待。
    华东是处在国防前线，海岸线又长，为了保卫祖国，保卫和平建设，有特别加强部队建设的必要。我们应加强部队的技术与文化教育，加强政治工作，并提高干部的质量。我们应迅速完成中央人民政府给予我们的建设海军和空军的光荣任务。
    为了克服困难及改善部队的生活，所有人民解放军及公安部队，除担任作战任务者外，均应无例外地遵照毛主席的指示，积极参加生产建设工作，和地方群众工作。
    （二）土地改革方面
    共同纲领第二十七条明确规定：“土地改革为发展生产力和国家工业化的必要条件。凡已实行土地改革的地区，必须保护农民已得土地的所有权。凡尚未实行土地改革的地区，必须发动农民群众，建立农民团体，经过清除土匪恶霸，减租减息和分配土地等项步骤，实现耕者有其田。”我华东人民应为共同纲领这项规定的彻底实现而奋斗。
    土地改革必须有准备有步骤地进行，并须与恢复和发展农业生产密切相结合。因此，凡已实行了土地改革的地区，应迅速确定地权，颁发土地证。凡土地改革条件尚未完备的地区，应迅速发动农民群众，建立农民协会，继续贯彻剿匪、反恶霸、减租及合理负担的政策，这样来积极准备土地改革的必要条件。凡社会秩序已经安定，广大农民群众已经组织起来，区乡政权已经改造，及领导上又已有把握的地区，即可进行分配土地，在今年秋后，凡土地改革准备工作已经完成的地区，应即开始进行分配土地。凡明年春季以前尚未贯彻土地改革的地区，可留待明年秋后来完成。总之，我们要尽一切努力，作到在今明两年之内，将华东各省（台湾除外）的土地改革全部完成。
    我们应当告诉每个劳动农民，使他们明白，土地改革须要有秩序地进行，否则不但会妨害生产，而且有被敌人破坏捣乱的危险。因此，不论在准备土地改革时期内，或在进行土地改革的过程中，必须坚决反对乱打、乱杀、乱抓、乱罚的错误倾向；必须坚决保护中农及富裕中农的利益；必须坚决不侵犯工商业，包括地主及旧式富农所经营的工商业在内；必须坚决爱护地主富农家庭出身的革命青年知识分子；必须坚决团结一切赞助土地改革的开明绅士；必须坚决纠正减租与征收公粮过程中所发生的偏向和错误。
    我们应使每个地主和旧式富农都知道：实行土地改革，消灭封建剥削制度，是为了把社会寄生的地主分子改造成为参加劳动生产和对社会有用的人群。因此，对一切遵守政府法令，及保护耕牛农具有功的地主和旧式富农，政府必将宽大处理，并保证他们在将来分配土地时得到足够维持生活的一份土地和财产。但对一切非法转移土地，宰杀耕牛，破坏农具，砍伐树木，拆卖房屋，生产怠工及以任何方法贿赂干部，收买农民，破坏土地改革的地主和旧式富农，必将予以严厉的处分。
    同时，我们必须使每一个人民政府的工作人员，人民解放军的指战员与农村工作干部知道：拥护农民土地改革的正义要求，及代表劳动农民群众的利益，是每个人民政府的工作人员，每个人民解放军的指战员与农村工作干部的天职。因此，不许私吞果实，不许多分果实，不许接受任何方式的贿赂，否则他们不但会脱离群众，遭受人民的反对，而且也是违反人民政府的法令。必将受到处分。（⑵⑶）
    （三）经济方面
    华东人民曾从国民党反动军阀官僚手中接收了大批官僚资本的企业，同时在华东各大中城市还拥有大量私营企业，这是华东经济有利的条件。但这些公私企业在解放之前，多遭受战争的破坏，解放之后，又受到敌人封锁的困难；同时，华东农村过去迭受敌人重点进攻的摧残，去年又普遍遭受严重水灾；再加上解放台湾支援前线任务繁重；战争创伤深重，亟待医治；过去从国民党手中所接收过来的企业，又大多是依靠帝国主义的官僚买办的经济机构，必须经过长期的改造，才能适合于新民主主义经济的要求——这些，都是华东经济暂时的不利条件。
    我们为了有计划地逐渐恢复改造和发展华东的经济，必须坚决依靠工人阶级，加强工会工作，发挥广大职工的生产积极性与创造性，厉行生产节约，克服各种浪费，减低生产成本，并从生产的发展中，逐步提高工人的生活待遇，逐步实行劳动保险与工人集体的福利事业；必须遵照毛主席的指示，坚决执行公私兼顾、劳资两利、城乡互助、内外交流的政策，来达到发展生产，繁荣经济的目的。
    在农业方面，应兴修水利，防洪防旱，救灾备荒，增加粮产，扩大植棉，积极垦荒，发展副业，提倡造林，争取于最短期间恢复战前农业生产水准。在沿海一带，应整顿盐业，恢复渔业，并逐步改善盐民和渔民的生活。在所有中小城市和农村的部队、学校及机关，均应普遍开展农业生产运动。
    在工业方面，应合理调剂原棉及其他原料的供应，恢复与发展华东现有的纺织业及其他有利国计民生的轻工业，并有重点地恢复与发展矿业及重工业；应按照生产企业化与管理民主化的原则，积极改造公营企业，坚决保护一切有利国计民生的私营企业，鼓励私人资本对这种企业的投资与增资；并应在可能与必要的条件下，鼓励和协助在上海的部分公私工厂内迁。
    在金融方面，应鼓励人民储蓄，便利侨汇，疏导社会游资投入生产，严禁金融投机。
    在贸易方面，应鼓励城乡物资交流，调剂供求，平稳物价，保护正当商业，严格取缔投机商业，实行对外贸易管制，和鼓励有利于国内经济发展的进出口贸易。
    在交通方面，应迅速恢复铁路、航运、公路、邮电各种事业，并改善其管理，提高其效率。为适应解放台湾的需要，与便利军民运输，应有计划地增加交通工具，开辟新线路，并发展民营航运。
    在合作事业方面，应鼓励和扶助广大劳动人民，根据自愿原则，发展合作事业，首先发展供销合作社及消费合作社，逐渐推及于运输、信用、生产等合作社。
    在财政方面，应实行财政统一，贯彻预算决算制度，实行合理负担，整理税收和公粮，保证完成中央给予华东公粮税收及公债的任务，厉行精简节约，反对贪污浪费，积累资金，以保证人民解放战争及必要事业的供给。
    （四）政治方面
    为了肃清反动派的残余势力，镇压反革命活动，坚决贯彻保障人民思想、言论、出版、集会、结社、通讯、人身、居住、迁徙、宗教信仰及示威游行的自由，并实行男女平等，婚姻自由，必须巩固和加强人民民主专政的政权。
    人民代表会议，在召集人民代表大会以前，是人民民主政权的基本形式。它是联系群众，加强团结，推进工作，克服困难的最好组织形式。其组织成份应包括工人阶级、农民阶级、革命军人、知识分子、小资产阶级、民族资产阶级、少数民族、国外华侨及其他爱国民主人士的代表。对中央人民政府委员会所通过的省、市、县各界人民代表会议组织通则，全华东各地人民政府必须认真地、迅速地、普遍地遵照执行。每一个三万人口以上的市和每一个县均须作到每三个月召开各界人民代表会议一次。所有华东各省各行政区除台湾尚待解放外，在一九五○年内，均须一律作到召开省的人民代表会议一次。华东军政委员会应遵照大行政区人民政府委员会组织通则的规定，一俟条件许可，即行召开华东各界人民代表会议，代行人民代表大会职权，并产生华东人民政府委员会。
    县以下各区乡均应普遍召开农民代表大会，实行改造各区乡政权，取消保甲制度；应训练工人、农民、妇女、知识青年中的先进分子参加人民政府的工作，并提高政权工作干部的质量。
    我们必须加强公安工作与司法工作，并改造旧的监狱。我们处理案件，应重证据，不重口供，严禁刑讯。处决人犯，必须经过一定的政府批准。
    我们必须实行简政，提高工作效率，以便人民政府更加密切联系各阶层人民。应发扬人民政权中廉洁勤朴为人民服务的革命工作作风，严惩贪污，禁止浪费，反对强迫命令脱离群众的官僚主义作风。在县市以上的各级人民政府内，应设立人民监察机关，以加强人民对政府的监督作用。
    我们对于一切守法的外国侨民，必切实予以保护；但对违反人民政府法令者，必予以应得的处分。
    （五）文化教育卫生方面
    我们应遵照中央人民政府“提高人民文化水平，培养国家建设的人才、肃清封建的、买办的、法西斯主义的思想，发展为人民服务的思想”的方针，开展华东文化教育工作。
    应积极改造公私立学校，提高教学质量，团结和改造原有教师；应有计划有步骤地实行普及教育，扫除文盲；应加强中等教育和高等教育，注重技术教育和生产教育，加强劳动者的业余教育和在职干部教育；应加强和扩大华东人民革命大学，教育大批知识青年和培养大批工农干部，以应革命工作和国家建设的需要；应动员大批知识青年下乡，参加农村文化教育工作和推动土地改革。
    应提倡文学艺术为人民服务，团结改造旧有文化艺术工作者，奖励优秀的文艺作品；有计划地发展人民电影戏剧事业；提倡社会科学与自然科学，奖励科学著作与发明。
    应加强对公营通讯社、报纸、刊物、广播电台和书店的领导，并积极指导私营报纸、广播电台及书店，使其报道真实新闻及出版有益于人民的书籍和读物。
    应推广卫生保健事业，指导各地人民进行防疫卫生运动，并注意保护产妇婴儿的健康。
    应注意交流中苏文化，介绍苏联建设的成就和经验，为巩固与发展中苏两国人民的友好团结而努力。
    我们目前所处的基本环境和情况是：一方面，我们已经获得了中国历史上空前伟大的胜利；但另一方面，在我们的面前还摆着严重的困难，需要我们去克服。正如毛主席所说：“帝国主义者和国内反动派决不甘心于他们的失败，他们还要作最后的挣扎。在全国平定以后，他们也还会以各种方式从事破坏和捣乱，他们将每日每时企图在中国复辟。这是必然的，毫无疑义的，我们务必不要松懈自己的警惕性。”但我们必须同时指出，我们面前的困难都是发展和胜利中的困难。我们有毛主席、中央人民政府和中国共产党的正确领导；有工人阶级、农民阶级、小资产阶级、民族资产阶级、国外华侨、少数民族及一切爱国民主人士空前大团结的力量；有各兄弟行政区的支援；有二十多年来艰苦奋斗克服一切困难的经验；有伟大友邦苏联及各新民主主义国家与全世界各国劳动人民的同情和援助。只要我们能够团结一致，遵循正确的方针努力奋斗，戒骄戒躁，虚心学习，发扬优点，克服缺点，保持艰苦奋斗的作风，并始终密切联系群众，我们就一定能够克服困难，争取全华东与全中国的解放，并完成建设新华东的光荣任务。
