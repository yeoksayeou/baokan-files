　　We've Found the Key to Branch Work
　　Ka Di, Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party Branch, Beijing No. 2 Clothing Factory

　　How can the Party organization in a factory guarantee production? Our branch at the No. 2 Factory has found the key. In the past, everyone wanted to improve production in the factory, but the impact was never great. When a work assignment came down, the branch committee team leaders would get busy. It seemed that as long as we held a few more meetings and did a few more mobilization efforts, the work would be done. Not holding meetings felt like something was missing in the work, and holding meetings felt like half the work was done. As for whether the Party members could actually implement the resolutions, little checking was done. The branch wanted to play a role, and the Party members wanted to work hard, but neither could have a significant impact. Branch committee member Yang Xueying was worried every day: "The Party members can't play a big role, we must step up education! When they encounter difficulties, they are just as helpless as the masses, this is terrible!" Hao Zhenjiang and Liu Taikui worked desperately hard, their hands were blistered from exhaustion, but they couldn't motivate many people. Yang Renhuan often advised the "bubblers" (those who talk big but are unwilling to work actively) near him: "Now that we're liberated, let's step up production to support the front!..." The reply was: "You are an activist, I am backward. Support the front? My mother is still starving at home!" When the cadres went down to the workshops, they were also busy with explanations, and after they finished speaking, they felt empty themselves.

　　When the summer uniform task came down this time, the Party members heard that 310,000 sets had to be completed by the end of April, and the quality requirements were also high. Everyone was at a loss. The cadres also didn't dare to go down to the workshops much. Everyone felt that unnecessary Party and Youth League activities should be stopped, and everyone should focus on production. Some Party members were thinking about their work while attending meetings. Li Kun said: "Let's end the meeting quickly, when I go back to the machine, the masses will say I'm backward." It was only then realized that Party activities in enterprises must be oriented towards production.

　　On January 10th, the branch committee passed a resolution to select the third shift to create experience. This shift of 109 people had 17 Party members and 25 Youth League members. First, a general branch meeting was held, emphasizing that "all efforts should be directed towards overcoming the current production difficulties, and improving quality and quantity must be achieved by improving work methods and enhancing technology." Then, a meeting of Party and Youth League members of the third shift was convened, and 34 groups were selected as key groups. In this group of ten people, Party members and Youth League members each accounted for three. They volunteered to do the experiment. The method was to divide the work, cooperating on the upper and lower garments, dividing them into two small parts, and then having the two small parts compete against each other. Labor was mutually assisted to save time, and problems were researched and corrected. Everyone's enthusiasm was quite high. However, some people stood by and said cynical things: "It won't last long, there are fast ones and slow ones, it's too disadvantageous." Wang Zhenyong and Zhao Wensheng (newly developed Party members) usually achieved first or second place, and they cooperated with those who were in third or fourth place. Wang and Zhao said: "Communist Party members must first sacrifice personal interests and overcome difficulties, this is what it means to take the lead." Under their influence, Liu Baohua, a mute worker in this group, also wrote a letter of challenge and requested to join the Party. Through their efforts, on January 11th, a new record of 7.4 sets per person per day (10 hours of work per day) was created, while the average was four sets. When the big-character poster was put up, the first shift panicked: "People have two hands, we have just as many, right?" Party member Zhu Baohu then led everyone to challenge the third shift. The second shift also responded, and heated competitions unfolded between shifts, groups, and individuals. At this time, the standard was also set at 6.5 sets per person per day. The quality and quantity of production greatly increased. Recently, the average daily output per person in the entire factory was 5.9 sets, and some individuals broke through 12 sets. In order to consolidate the achievements already made, the branch called on each Party member to make a personal production plan. New Party member Wang Fengting previously produced five sets per day (the average was three sets). After encouragement, he made a detailed plan to scientifically arrange his daily time, and now he has increased his output to ten sets per day and helps others. The masses near him learned his method and also improved their output. Party members, team leaders, and inspectors also made plans and posted them next to themselves. Zhao Naizhuang and others also led the masses in making plans. The branch is now generally checking the implementation of the plans and the difficulties encountered.

　　At this time, the masses were willing to listen to what the Party members said, there were also methods for production, Party activities became an indispensable part of production, Party members were no longer afraid of meetings, and the enthusiasm of the branch committee and Party members increased accordingly.

　　During the movement, attention was also paid to absorbing outstanding individuals into the Party, strengthening the Party's strength, and in turn, leading the movement more powerfully. Since January, the number of Party members has increased from 65 to 80. But this is only the first step, more problems need to be solved, and our professional knowledge is still very lacking. We will work harder and study diligently so that our branch can play a guaranteeing and supervising role in the production of the No. 2 Factory. (Attached picture)

　　我们摸到支部工作的诀窍了
    北京被服二厂中共支部书记  卡笛
    工厂党组织怎样保证生产，我们二厂的支部摸到诀窍了。过去大家也都想把厂里的生产搞好，但发挥的作用总是不大。工作任务一下来，支委小组长就忙了起来。似乎只要多开几个会，多做几次动员工作就可以作好。不开会就像工作上缺少点什么，开了会就像是工作完成了一半。至于党员究竟能否把决议贯彻下去，可就很少检查了。支部想起作用，党员也想努力，但总起不了太大作用。支委杨学英天天着急：“党员起不了多大作用呀，赶快抓紧教育吧！碰到困难就跟群众一样的没办法，这还了得！”郝振江刘太奎拚命死干，手都累的磨了泡也带动不了几个人。杨仁环常劝他附近的泡将们（爱说空话而不肯积极干活的人们）：“解放了快加紧生产支援前线吧！……”回答的却是：“你是积极分子，我落后，支援前线吗？我妈还在家饿着哩！”干部们下去也是忙于解释，讲完了自己也觉着挺空洞。
    这次夏服任务下来，党员们听见四月底完成三十一万套，质量要求也高，一个个都没了办法。干部们也不大敢下工房。都觉着不必要的党团活动也该停止了，大家一心搞生产吧。有的党员一面开会一面在想他的活，李昆说：“快散会吧，回机器上群众又该说我落后了。”这时才发觉企业中党的活动必须面向生产。
    一月十日，支委会上通过选定三班创造经验。这班一○九人有党员十七个，团员二十五个。先开了支部大会着重指出：“所有力量转向克服这次生产困难，提高质产量必在改进工作办法和提高技术中求得。”后又召集三班党团员会议，挑了三十四组为重点组。该组十人中党团员各占三名，他们自报奋勇愿作实验。办法是分工合作上下衣分成两小部分做，两小部又挑战竞赛。劳动互助节省时间，出了毛病，研究修正。大家情绪相当高。有人却站在旁边说风凉话：“合不长，有快有慢太吃亏了。”王振永、赵文生（新发展的党员）平日成绩一二等，合作的都是三四等，王赵二人说：“共产党员要首先牺牲个人利益，克服困难，这才叫带头作用。”在他们的影响下，这组哑叭工人刘宝华也写了挑战书，并要求入党。在他们努力下，一月十一日创造了每人日产七·四套（每日工作十小时）的新纪录，这时一般人是四套。大字报登出来，一班着了慌：“人家两只手，咱也不少哇？”党员朱宝胡便带动大家向三班挑战。二班也响应了，班、组、个人间都展开了热烈的竞赛。这时标准也订了下来，每人日产六套半。质产量大增，最近半月全厂平均每人日产五·九套，个别人突破十二套。为了巩固已得成绩，支部号召每个党员订个人生产计划。新党员王逢庭先前日产五套（一般人三套），经过鼓励，订了详细计划把每天的时间科学安排，现增到日产十套，并帮助别人。他附近的群众学他的办法产量也提高了。党员、班长、检验也都订了计划贴在自己旁边，赵乃庄等并带领群众订计划。支部现正普遍检查计划执行的情况和困难。
    这时党员说话群众也愿听了，生产也有了办法了，党的活动成了生产中必不可少的部分，党员也不怕开会了，支委和党员的情绪随之提高。
    在运动中并随时注意吸收优秀分子入党，壮大党的力量，反转来更有力的领导运动，从一月份起，党员已由六十五名增到八十名。但这只是迈了第一步，更多的问题还需要我们去解决，而我们的业务知识还十分缺乏，我们将更努力工作认真学习，使我们的支部在二厂生产中起到保证监督作用。（附图片）
