　　Everyone knows that America's largest radio stations are widely used by businessmen for advertising purposes. According to official statistics, nearly 95 percent of the broadcasting time of large radio stations is spent on advertising.
　　One radio station's advertising program uses a one-act play to describe a child who doesn't like to eat breakfast in the morning but loves to wash his face; but when he washes his face, he doesn't use any other soap, but only the soap produced by a certain company. This company pays the author of the one-act play royalties and pays to rent the radio station to broadcast this program.
　　However, according to the Daily Worker, a dispute suddenly arose: a company selling oatmeal and other children's breakfast foods protested. At the company's request, the one-act play was revised.
　　After that, the naughty child's appetite increased greatly. Every morning, he not only washes his face with the soap company's "superior soap," but also eats two servings of the breakfast produced by the food company. Both companies are very satisfied. The naughty child strives to meet their demands. The only losers are the American listeners, who listen to "soap songs" and "oatmeal dramas" from morning till night.

　　顽皮的孩子和疙瘩的生意人
    大家都知道，美国最大的广播电台被生意人广泛利用来做广告之用了。据官方统计，大电台的播音时间差不多有百分之九十五花在广告上。
    有一家电台的广告节目，是用独幕剧的方式，描述一个孩子，他早晨不爱吃早饭，却极爱洗脸；但他洗脸时，不用别种肥皂，而只用某公司出品的肥皂。这家公司付给独幕剧作者以稿费并出资租借电台，来播送这一节目。
    然而，据《每日工人》报报道，忽然发生了争执：出售麦片及其它儿童早餐的食品公司提出了抗议。在这公司的要求下，独幕剧修改了。
    此后，那顽皮的孩子食欲大增。每天早晨他不但用那个肥皂公司的“高超的肥皂”洗脸，而且要吃两份那个食品公司所出品的早餐。两家公司都十分满意。那顽皮的孩子努力满足它们的要求。倒霉的只是美国的听众们，他们从早到晚尽听着“肥皂歌”和“麦片剧”。
