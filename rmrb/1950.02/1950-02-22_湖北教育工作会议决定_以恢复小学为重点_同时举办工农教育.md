　　Central and Southern News: The Hubei Province recently convened a joint meeting of education section chiefs from various special districts and municipal governments. The meeting summarized the educational work since liberation and discussed the educational work policy, teacher training, and educational funding for this year. Based on the spirit of the Ministry of Education's National Education Conference, the meeting further clarified that the main target of new democratic education work should be workers, peasants, and soldiers, and that the primary task in new areas should be to win over, unite, and transform intellectuals.

　　The meeting decided that the focus of education work in 1950 should be on restoring primary schools while simultaneously developing workers' and peasants' education. In the first half of this year, the number of primary schools restored throughout the province should reach 60% of the pre-liberation level. Secondary schools that should be restored will continue to be restored, and those that have been restored will gradually undergo necessary and possible reforms. In-service teaching staff will be strengthened with learning and one-third of all teachers will be trained in rotation within 1950. At the same time, widespread worker-peasant spare-time literacy education will be carried out, and each provincial or county-level primary school should set up at least one worker-peasant spare-time literacy class. These literacy classes should be relatively standardized, with a certain curriculum plan and system. Preparations will also be made to establish worker-peasant middle schools, starting with the training of teachers. To prepare for launching the campaign to eliminate illiteracy, teacher training, curriculum development, propaganda mobilization, and investigation and research work must be carried out this year. Each county should restore one People's Education Center, and each special municipality should establish a cultural troupe to strengthen social education work and reform old operas, focusing on the transformation and development of the Chu opera. In addition, it is necessary to prevent large numbers of young people and children from dropping out of school during rent reduction and land reform. Schools at all levels should admit family members and children of revolutionary martyrs as much as possible, and formulate methods for subsidizing the enrollment of martyr's family members' children to solve the difficulties of enrollment for poor martyr's family members' children.

　　Finally, Li Shi, Director of the Hubei Provincial Department of Education, called on people from all walks of life who are enthusiastic about cultural and educational undertakings to raise funds to establish schools in his summary at the meeting; and to liquidate school properties and ancestral temple properties to solve the financial difficulties of restoring primary schools. In addition, the management and transformation of private schools should be strengthened so that they can gradually implement new democratic education.
