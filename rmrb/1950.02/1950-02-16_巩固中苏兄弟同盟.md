The epoch-making Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance, and the Sino-Soviet agreements on the Chinese Changchun Railway, Lushunkou, and Dalian, and the Sino-Soviet agreement on a loan to the People's Republic of China, were signed in Moscow on February 14, 1950. This momentous event has shaken the world! It fills the people of China and the Soviet Union, and all conscious working people around the world, and all of humanity who are loyal to the just cause of world peace, with joy and excitement! It makes all the imperialist aggressors and warmongers weep and tremble!

The world imperialist bloc, headed by US imperialism, after the rule of its running dog, the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, was fundamentally overthrown by the Chinese people, has been trying to alienate Sino-Soviet relations as an important strategic policy on the China issue. The US government fabricated the slander of "the Soviet Union attempting to control China" in the White Paper it published on August 5, 1949. On January 12 this year, Acheson further fabricated that "the Soviet Union is merging the northern regions of China." On January 25, the US State Department again used fabricated "rumors" to compile so-called "background materials" to continue to slander Sino-Soviet relations. While Sino-Soviet negotiations were being held in Moscow, US imperialism and its collaborators fabricated even more shameless rumors to sow discord. The United Press telegram openly admitted that "Acheson hopes to eventually alienate Beijing from Moscow." On the other hand, US imperialism is chanting corrupt and tattered spells such as "Open Door" and "Equal Opportunity."

However, all the shameless conspiracies of US imperialism have been completely bankrupted. The long-standing friendship between the people of China and the Soviet Union has been consolidated by the signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance. This Sino-Soviet brotherly alliance, established in a new historical period, encompassing more than one-third of the world's population, is an invincible alliance against imperialist aggression. This alliance will powerfully restrain Japan and any other country directly or indirectly colluding with Japan in acts of aggression and sabotage of peace. Therefore, this has severely struck a blow to US imperialism's fostering of the resurgence of Japanese aggression, striving for the conclusion of a peace treaty with Japan, and consolidating peace and universal security in the East and the world.

The new treaty and agreements stipulate that after the conclusion of a peace treaty with Japan, but no later than 1952, all rights and properties of the Chinese Changchun Railway will be transferred to our government without compensation; Soviet troops will withdraw from the Lushunkou naval base; it is declared that the administration of Dalian is entirely under the direct jurisdiction of our government; and it is stipulated that the property managed and leased by the Soviet Union in Dalian will be taken over by our government. The foreign ministers of China and the Soviet Union also announced that the property acquired by the Soviet economic organs from the Japanese in the Northeast, and all the real estate of the former Soviet barracks in Beijing, would be handed over to our country without compensation. In the face of this great and selfless friendship of the Soviet Union towards our people, Acheson and others, the US imperialist elements who fabricated the shameless slanders of "the Soviet Union merging northern China," will be in a terrible plight with no place to hide.

According to the Sino-Soviet agreement on loans, the Soviet Union will loan us $300 million within five years, to be used by our country to pay for the machinery, equipment and materials provided by the Soviet Union, with an annual interest rate of only one percent. This agreement is in sharp contrast to US imperialism's "economic assistance."

US imperialism has shamelessly boasted that only it can give other countries "economic recovery." But haven't all the countries that have accepted the "Marshall Plan" been complaining bitterly? According to this plan, US imperialism gave European countries $4 billion in "aid," but required European countries to spend $6 billion to expand their military and implement the US's aggressive plans. Under the Marshall Plan, production in European countries has been declining. For example, in France, 33 percent of all imports come from the United States, but the United States only buys 6 percent of French exports. What is imported from the United States? The amount of tobacco, glass socks, and chewing gum is twice the amount of mining equipment, dried fruit is two and a half times more than rubber, and cheese and milk powder are five times more than steel industry machinery. Production equipment accounts for only 2 percent of the large amount of American goods. The slogan "France must become an agricultural country" is being revived. Isn't it obvious that US imperialism wants to strangle the national economies of other countries? Who in the world has ever seen a loan like the one the Soviet Union has given to our country with preferential terms of an annual interest rate of one percent, and delivered entirely in the form of industrial machinery and equipment, to accelerate our country's industrialization?

The Soviet Union's enthusiastic and selfless assistance to the Chinese people is unparalleled. This is a concrete manifestation of the great internationalist thought and policy of Lenin and Stalin.

The great Lenin, as early as June 1920, in the "Preliminary Draft Theses on the National and Colonial Questions" prepared for the Second Congress of the Communist International, already pointed out: "Now we cannot confine ourselves to merely recognizing or proclaiming the mutual approach of the working people of all nations, but we need to carry out a policy of realizing the closest alliance between all national and colonial liberation movements and the Soviet Union." "All communists must help the bourgeois-democratic liberation movements in these countries, and above all, they have the obligation to give the most active assistance to the working people in the colonial countries." Today, the alliance between the Soviet Union and our country is precisely the closest alliance mentioned by Lenin; the Soviet Union is implementing the most active assistance mentioned by Lenin for our people. This infinitely sincere spirit of internationalist friendship is often incomprehensible to those who have old bourgeois or petty-bourgeois views and national prejudices. This point was also pointed out in Lenin's above-mentioned thesis. Lenin said: "Petty-bourgeois nationalism only proclaims the recognition of national equality as internationalism, while still preserving national egoism sacredly. But proletarian internationalism requires: first, that the interests of the proletarian struggle in one country must be subordinate to the interests of this struggle on a worldwide scale; second, that the nation that has achieved the victory over capitalism must be able and willing to make the greatest national sacrifices for the overthrow of international capital." How do national egoism and national prejudice arise? Lenin pointed out: This is because "the oppression of colonial nations and small nations by the imperialist powers for hundreds of years has left not only hatred for the generally oppressing nations and for the proletariats of these nations among the working masses of the oppressed countries, but also mistrust of them." "On the other hand, the more backward a country is, the stronger are its small agricultural management, patriarchal relations, and closed-door atmosphere. This inevitably leads to the most deeply rooted petty-bourgeois prejudices, namely, the prejudices of national egoism and national narrowness, being particularly strong and particularly consolidated. These prejudices can only be eliminated after imperialism and capitalism in advanced countries are eliminated, and only after the entire foundation of the economic life of backward countries is completely changed."

The awakened Chinese people, having experienced the profound friendship of the Soviet Union towards our people since the October Socialist Revolution, have long recognized who is the enemy and who is the friend, and sincerely wish for the eternal friendly cooperation between the people of China and the Soviet Union. We will never forget the internationalist spirit of the great Soviet proletariat led by Lenin and Stalin's party, and the great morality shown by the Soviet Union in assisting all oppressed nations and opposing the struggle against imperialism. Today, under the leadership of Chairman Mao Zedong, the Chinese people firmly stand on the side of the world peace front led by the Soviet Union, and make our newly emerging People's Republic of China and the great, strong socialist country of the Soviet Union a strong brotherly alliance of 700 million people, so that our country, after completely eliminating the remaining bandits, will rapidly transform from a backward agricultural country into a strong industrialized country. We believe that in the new era of Sino-Soviet friendly cooperation, the Chinese people will become more conscious and eliminate from their thinking the narrow prejudices of certain national egoism left by the conditions of China, a backward agricultural society, especially by imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism and the Kuomintang reactionary rule and oppression which concentratedly manifested them; and emerge as a great nation with a high degree of political consciousness and a high degree of culture, full of a new internationalist patriotic spirit, in the big family of peace-loving nations of the world, and make greater contributions to opposing the instigators of imperialist war and to consolidating world peace and the true friendship between nations!

### 巩固中苏兄弟同盟

　　巩固中苏兄弟同盟
    划时代的中苏友好同盟互助条约，和中苏关于中国长春铁路、旅顺口与大连的协定、中苏关于贷款给中华人民共和国的协定，在一九五○年二月十四日签订于莫斯科。这一个重大行动震动了全世界！它使中苏两国人民和全世界觉悟的劳动人民及一切忠诚于正义的世界和平事业的人类欢欣鼓舞！它使一切帝国主义的侵略凶手和战争贩子们啼泣、颤抖！
    以美帝国主义为首的世界帝国主义集团，在其走狗蒋介石匪帮的统治被中国人民根本推翻之后，极力以离间中苏关系作为它对中国问题的重要战略方针。美国政府在一九四九年八月五日公布的白皮书中就捏造了所谓“苏联企图控制中国”的谰言。今年一月十二日艾奇逊进一步捏造“苏联正在将中国北部地区实行合并”。一月二十五日美国国务院又用捏造的“传闻”编成所谓“背景材料”，继续诽谤中苏关系。在中苏谈判正在莫斯科举行的时候，美帝国主义及其合作者更大量制造了挑拨离间的无耻谣言。合众社电讯曾公开招认“艾奇逊希望最后能离间北京与莫斯科”。另一方面，美帝国主义又在念道着“门户开放”“机会均等”之类的腐臭不堪的符咒。
    然而，美帝国主义的一切无耻阴谋，遭受到彻底的破产了。长期存在于中苏两大国人民间的友谊已经由中苏友好同盟互助条约的签订而巩固下来了。这个在新的历史时期所建立的拥有全地球人口三分之一以上的中苏兄弟同盟，是反对帝国主义侵略的不可战胜的同盟。这个同盟将有力地制止日本及其他直接间接在侵略行为上与日本相勾结的任何国家之重新侵略与破坏和平。因此，这就沉重地打击了美帝国主义扶植日本侵略的再起，争取对日和约的缔结，巩固东方及世界的和平与普遍安全。
    新的条约和协定，规定在对日和约缔结后但不迟于一九五二年，将中国长春铁路的一切权利和全部财产无偿地移交我国政府，苏军将从旅顺口海军根据地撤退，申明大连的行政完全直属我国政府管辖，规定苏联在大连代管与租用的财产由我国政府接收。中苏两国外长又宣布：苏联经济机关在东北由日本人手中所取得的财产，和苏联过去在北京的兵营的全部房产，无偿地交与我国。在苏联对于我国人民的这种伟大的无私的友谊面前，捏造“苏联合并中国北部”等等无耻谰言的美国帝国主义分子艾奇逊之流，将狼狈得无地自容了。
    按照中苏关于贷款的协定，苏联在五年内将贷给我国三万万美元，作为我国偿付苏联所付予的机器装备和器材之用，每年仅付年利百分之一。这个协定与美帝国主义的“经济援助”是一个尖锐的对照。
    美帝国主义曾厚颜无耻地夸称，只有它能够给其他国家以“经济的复兴”。但是，所有接受“马歇尔计划”的各国，不是都叫苦连天了吗？按照这个计划，美帝国主义给欧洲国家以四十亿美元的“援助”，却要欧洲国家花费六十亿美元来扩充军备，实施美国的侵略计划。在马歇尔计划下，欧洲各国的生产日益衰颓了。比如法国，一年的全部输入有百分之三十三是从美国来的，而美国却只购买了法国输出的百分之六。从美国输入的是什么呢？烟草、玻璃袜子和口香糖竟达两倍于采矿装备的数量，干果比橡皮多了两倍半，乳酪、奶粉竟达五倍于钢铁工业机器的数量。在大量的美国货物中，生产装备只占百分之二。“法国必须变为农业国”的口号又在复活了。美帝国主义要扼死其他国家的国民经济，这难道还不明显吗？世界上有谁看见过像苏联这样地给予我国以年利百分之一的优惠条件的贷款，而又完全以工业机器设备和器材来交付，以加速我国工业化的呢？
    苏联热情无私地援助中国人民的伟大道义是无可比拟的。这是列宁、斯大林的伟大的国际主义思想和政策的具体表现。
    伟大的列宁，早在一九二○年六月，在为共产国际第二次代表大会所作的《民族和殖民地问题提纲初稿》中，就已经指出：“现在不能只限于仅仅承认或宣布各民族劳动人民之互相接近，而需要进行一种实现一切民族和殖民地解放运动与苏联最密切联盟的政策”。“一切共产党必须帮助这些国度里面的资产阶级民主的解放运动，首先，对于殖民地国度的劳动人民，尤有给予最积极援助的义务。”现在苏联与我国的同盟，正是列宁所说的最密切的联盟；苏联对于我国人民，正实行着列宁所说的最积极援助。这种无限真诚的国际主义的友爱精神，往往是具有旧的资产阶级或小资产阶级观点和民族偏见的人所不能理解的。这一点，早在列宁的上述论文中也已经指出了。列宁说：“小资产阶级的民族主义，只是把承认民族平等宣布为国际主义，把民族的利己主义仍然神圣地保存起来。但无产阶级的国际主义则要求：第一、一国的无产阶级斗争的利益，须服从于全世界范围内的这一斗争的利益；第二、实现了战胜资本主义的民族，要能够而且准备为推翻国际资本而作最大的民族的牺牲。”民族利己主义和民族偏见是如何产生的呢？列宁指出：这是由于“几百年来帝国主义列强对殖民地民族与弱小民族的压迫，在被压迫国度的劳动群众中间，不但留下了对一般压迫民族和对这些民族无产阶级的愤恨，而且留下了对他们的不信任。”“另一方面，某国愈是落后，则其小农业经营、家长制关系和闭塞风气愈是强固。这就不可避免地引导到那最根深蒂固的小资产阶级的成见，即民族利己主义与民族狭隘性的成见会特别强大和特别巩固。这些成见，只有在先进国度的帝国主义和资本主义消灭以后，只有在落后国度经济生活的整个基础彻底改变以后才能消灭。”
    觉悟了的中国人民，由于体验了十月社会主义革命以来苏联对于我国人民的深厚友谊，早已认清了谁是敌人、谁是朋友，而衷心地愿望中苏两大国人民永远的友好合作。我们对于列宁，斯大林的党所领导的伟大苏联无产阶级的国际主义精神，对于苏联在援助各被压迫民族和反对帝国主义斗争中，所表现的伟大道义，是永不会忘记的。今天，中国人民在毛泽东主席的领导之下，坚定地站在以苏联为首的世界和平阵线的一边，并使我们新兴的中华人民共和国与伟大强盛的社会主义国家苏联，结成了七万万人的强固的兄弟同盟，使我国在彻底消灭残余匪帮之后，将迅速地从落后的农业国变成强盛的工业化的国家。我们相信，在中苏友好合作的新时代，中国人民将更加觉悟起来，从思想上消除由于中国这个落后的农业社会的条件，特别是由于帝国主义、封建主义和官僚资本主义及其集中表现的国民党反动统治与压迫所留下的某些民族利己主义的狭隘的偏见；而以一个具有高度政治觉悟和高度文化的、充满新的国际主义的爱国主义精神的伟大民族，出现于世界爱好和平的各民族的大家庭中，为反对帝国主义战争挑拨者，为巩固世界和平与各民族间的真正的友谊而作更大的贡献！
