　　“Nothing Can Be Done Without Everyone!”
　　——The Story of Communist Party Member Liu Changfu Leading the Masses in Production at Tianjin Steel Plant
　　Lù Níng
　　The rolling mill workshop in our steel plant has achieved good results in production and has been commended by higher authorities.
　　The foreman of the rolling mill is Liu Changfu, who was promoted after liberation. He is active in his work and physically strong. Anyone who sees him will say, "Wow! He really is the standard steelworker."
　　Comrade Changfu grew up in the countryside and came to Tianjin empty-bellied because he could not stand the exploitation of the landlords. He said: "At that time, I thought, as long as I'm fed, I'll do any kind of work!" In this way, he worked as a "coolie" for more than ten years under the rule of Japanese devils and Kuomintang reactionaries. The oppression he suffered at that time is unbearable to mention.
　　After the liberation of Tianjin, the factory was turned upside down. Most of the guys who used to bully people bowed their heads and admitted their mistakes to the workers. A very few bad guys and special agents were also punished by the People's Government. This made the workers as happy as if they were living in the spring morning. Liu Changfu was promoted to foreman, and his heart was as if mixed with honey and sugar, sweet through and through, and beautiful beyond compare. At meetings, he could only say: "We have become masters, let's work hard!..." Then he would just laugh with his mouth open.
　　Soon Changfu became a glorious Communist Party member.
　　Production in the rolling mill is very intense. The machines roared like the long thunder of May; the red-hot steel bars reddened the faces of every worker. The workers were all very strong, and even the few "hook-up" little devils were as solid as little iron eggs. The commander of this production army was foreman Liu Changfu.
　　On January 24th, the "back-up wheel" on the ××MM large rolling mill suddenly had a crack. If it was repaired immediately, it would delay production for a day or two. Zhang Lianyuan, the person in charge of the rolling mill, and Liu Changfu and other workers discussed it and decided to use it as it was for the time being, and repair it when work stopped on Sunday (January 29th). But on Saturday afternoon at three o'clock—when the whole plant was working intensely—the "back-up wheel" finally broke, and all the large and small machines stopped. At this time, the workers tightly surrounded the broken "back-up wheel," carefully examining the machine as if caring for an injured partner, feeling very uncomfortable, and without a single idea.
　　Liu Changfu was originally on the night shift, but he also rushed into the plant at this time. Seeing this situation, he led everyone to sort out waste materials and use the small rolling mill to roll round steel. This not only utilized waste materials but also continued production. In the middle of the night, the waste materials were rolled, and Liu Changfu led the replacement of the small rolling rolls. This work was not simple. Everyone was busy all night, but it still wasn't fixed. Some workers stretched and yawned, saying, "Forget it, let's work overtime during the day!" Others said, "Let's come earlier on Monday!" But Liu Changfu thought: If this isn't fixed today, and the back-up wheel isn't installed, another day of production will be delayed on Monday. What a great loss that would be! So he smiled and said to everyone: "Come on, guys, grit your teeth, and I guarantee we'll get it comfortable in another hour!" He worked even more intensely. Changfu has always gotten along well with everyone, and with this joke, everyone felt a lot more relaxed and started attacking again with all their might! They got everything ready at seven o'clock in the morning. Everyone felt very relieved.
　　Liu Changfu was still thinking about the "back-up wheel." On his way home, he said to Communist Party member Sun Fengxi and League member Yu Baocai: "I'll go to the factory at three o'clock in the afternoon to see the 'back-up wheel.' If it's repaired, we'll install it. Production won't be delayed again next Monday!" They all said: "Yes, I'll come too!"
　　Just after two o'clock, Liu Changfu, Sun Fengxi, and Yu Baocai all went to the factory, waiting for the mechanical shop to repair the "back-up wheel." They pushed this red-hot thing to the entrance of the rolling mill together, but because it was too hot to handle, they decided to go back and have dinner before coming back.
　　At nine o'clock, Liu Changfu, Sun Fengxi, and Yu Baocai united many workers, and even Zhou Tingxi, who was sick, came to participate. Wang Chunhua's eyes were already bloodshot, but he still wanted to come to work. This automatic shock team started to install the "back-up wheel." The work was very intense, but every word and every sound expressed infinite joy. Zhou Tingxi even kept telling jokes to everyone. This matter was even kept secret from the management personnel in the factory. At ten o'clock, they installed the "back-up wheel" properly. Everyone stood in front of the machine and smiled excitedly as if they had won a victory. A worker said: "Changfu, this matter couldn't have been done without you!" Changfu wiped the sweat from his face and said modestly: "This is everyone's strength. It couldn't have been done without everyone's strength!"
　　On Monday, production in the rolling mill continued as usual with great intensity.

　　“离了大家办不成！”
　　——天津制钢厂党员刘长福带领群众生产的故事
　　陆宁
    轧钢工场在我们制钢厂里，生产上是有好成绩的，上级曾通令嘉奖过。
    轧钢场的班长叫刘长福，是解放后提升的，工作积极，身体强壮，谁看见他都会说“唔！这真是标准的钢铁工人。”
    长福同志在乡下长大，因为受不了地主的剥削，才空着肚子跑到天津来。他说：“那时我心想，只要管饭，咱啥活儿都干！”就这样，他一直在日本鬼子和国民党反动派统治下干了十几年的“苦力”。那时候，他所受的压迫，是不忍再提的。
    天津解放后，工厂里翻了个过。以前欺侮人的家伙们，大多数都向工人们低头认错了。极少数的坏蛋特务分子，也受到了人民政府的制裁。这使得工友们像生活在春天的早晨一样快活。刘长福被提拔当了班长，他心里真是白糖拌蜂蜜，甜里透甜，美上加美。开会的时候，他只能说：“咱们当了主人，加油干吧！……”再就是合不住嘴的笑。
    不久长福成了一个光荣的共产党员。
    轧钢场的生产是很紧张的，机器像五月的长雷一样在叫啸；烧红的钢条，映红了每个工友的面庞，工友们真是一个赛一个壮，就连几个“拉勾的”小鬼，也像小铁蛋一样结实。这支生产军的指挥人就是刘长福班长。
    一月二十四日，××ＭＭ的大轧钢机上的“靠背轮”忽然有了裂纹。如果立刻修理，就得耽误一两天的生产。轧钢场的主管张连元和刘长福等工友合计了一下，决定先凑合着用，等到星期日（一月二十九日）歇工时再修理。但是在维持到星期六下午三点钟——全场正在紧张工作时，“靠背轮”终于坏了，所有大小机器也都随着停下来，这时工友把坏了的“靠背轮”紧紧包围了一层，急忙地察看这机器，就像看护受了伤的伙伴，心里非常的难受，又都没有一个主意。
    刘长福本来是夜班，这时也赶进场来。一看这情况，他就领导大家整理废料，改用小轧钢机轧盘条。这样既利用了废料，又继续生产。半夜，废料轧完了，刘长福又领导换修小轧辊。这个工作并不简单，大家直直的忙了一夜，可是还没修起来，有的工友伸伸懒腰打着呵欠说：“算了，白天加班吧！”有的说：“星期一早点来弄吧！”但刘长福心想：如果今天不弄好这一摊儿，还有靠背轮没按装上，星期一又得耽误一天生产，这该是多大损失呢？！于是他笑着对大家说：‘来吧，伙计，咬咬牙，再有一个钟头就保管把它弄舒服了！’他工作得更紧张起来，长福一向和大家合得来，又这么一开玩笑，大家觉得轻松了不少，便又猛力地突击起来！他们在早晨七点钟把一切都弄好了。大家心里很松快。
    刘长福心里还惦记着“靠背轮”，他在回家的路上对党员孙凤喜，团员于宝才说：“我下午三点钟进厂看看‘靠背轮’，如果修好了，咱们就按装起来。下星期一就不会再耽误生产了！”他们也都说：“对，我也来！”
    刚过两点钟，刘长福、孙凤喜、于宝才三人都进厂了，直等着机械场修起了“靠背轮”，又一同把这火红的东西推到轧钢场门口，实在因为它还烫手，才决定回去吃了晚饭再来。
    九点钟，刘长福、孙凤喜、于宝才又团结了许多工友，连带着病的周廷玺也赶来参加，王春华的眼已熬红了，他仍要来工作。这个自动突击小组，开始动手按装“靠背轮”，工作是非常的紧张，但是每句话，每个响声都表示着无限的愉快。周廷玺还一直给大家说笑话。这样的事情，连厂里的管理人员也被瞒起来了。十点钟的时候，他们把“靠背轮”按装妥当。每个人站在机器面前像打了胜仗一样地兴奋地笑着。工友说：“长福，这件事离了你可办不成啊！”长福擦一擦脸上的汗珠谦虚地说：“这是大家的力量，没有大家的力量就办不成！”
    星期一，轧钢场的生产又照常紧张地进行了。
