　　How We Rehearsed "Moscow Character"
　　Lu Su, author
　　We must first thank the leadership, our Soviet friends, and the advanced figures in the theatrical world for the guidance and help they gave us during the rehearsal of "Moscow Character."
　　This is a script in which political and artistic qualities are highly integrated. Its background is the construction of the post-war five-year plan. It reflects some of the problems in the economic construction of a socialist country about to enter communism. In the optimistic comedic effect felt by the audience, the author gives sharp and strict criticism to Podapov, who has lost his sense of novelty, and vigorously criticizes Chachev's blindness. At the same time, the author does not relax in criticizing the shortcomings of anyone else. However, if our entire effort in rehearsal only focuses on highlighting the prominent events in the story—the central point of the debate—and not on highlighting the noble qualities of the Soviet people; if it only shows the criticism of certain people, and fails to show their highly conscious spirit of self-criticism, then it will distort the events. Therefore, we determined that singing the praises of socialism and the "Moscow character" is the primary task, and criticism is carried out on this basis. In fact, although there is serious struggle in the play, there is not a single villain, not a single negated character, which illustrates that the driving force of socialist social development is no longer class struggle, but criticism and self-criticism.
　　Another key issue we encountered in dealing with this play was that when we first approached the script, we had a simple and one-sided idea, believing that the problem would be solved as long as Podapov accepted criticism in the ending. This is indeed a wrong understanding of socialist construction. Because the story of the play tells us that Podapov's factory's decision to complete the five-year plan in three and a half years on the original basis is not an easy task, but needs to be solved with more intensive labor. Therefore, at this original technical level, Podapov cannot accept additional orders. But in the third act, the district committee's decision to manufacture new machines is not based on the requirements of the textile factory alone, but on the scientific conclusion reached by the engineer Klivsov after a thorough study of the problem: "Mechanize the work that is still done by hand, create new working machines to improve technical equipment, and improve the factory's transportation work." This is the brilliant feature of the play's solution to the problem. This idea runs through the entire play. For example, at the end of the play, Grinev, Gorbenco, and Klivsov are engaged in another invention plan, which shows that this creativity is the reality of socialism.
　　Another problem in the rehearsal was how to overcome the distance between the actors, the director, and the script. Our actors' situations were very inconsistent (the same goes for the director). Their political literacy, life experience, and artistic style were different: some participated in the revolution and joined the Party during the War of Resistance Against Japan, some participated in the revolution during the Patriotic War, and some only started working after the liberation of Beijing. Just in terms of life experience, there are differences between urban and rural areas. Therefore, it is naturally extremely difficult for these actors (and the director) to perform the characters of the old Bolsheviks in the Soviet Union, to perform the ideological struggle within the Party, and to perform the sharp themes in the current Soviet society.
　　In order to obtain better results on the existing basis, we organized a "Moscow Character" working group led by Comrade Xu Yu and others in the preparatory stage. The main task was to be responsible for collecting materials as preparation for learning. Then, we organized a director team and actor group led by Comrade Liu Yumin, including Han Bing, Yin Zhenjia, and Lu Su, to do the first step of learning under the leadership of the theater. We first studied the Soviet Union's economic construction to obtain the basis for understanding the characters in the script. Further, we learned about the qualities of the Soviet people from literary works and movies. Everyone was very enthusiastic about learning, and they all realized that there was no way to act in and direct this play without improving themselves politically and ideologically. Some new comrades even said, "After I finish acting in 'Moscow Character,' I will apply to join the Communist Party." However, until the play was staged, we still did not achieve higher achievements in this regard. This is because, on the one hand, the time was too short; on the other hand, the improvement of a person's political and ideological level cannot be achieved overnight. We must continue to work hard.
　　In order to accurately express the content of the script, we did not emphasize the issue of comedy style in the initial stage of rehearsal, so as to avoid the tendency to uglify the characters, but only emphasized the reality and rationality of the performance. In this stage, the actors all did plot research, role analysis, and analysis of unit goals.
　　This play is a Soviet play. Obviously, we do not have the life experience of the Soviet Union and cannot experience life. However, as Comrade Zhou Yang later pointed out: the qualities of people in socialist society are growing in the people of the new China, the members and cadres of the Chinese Communist Party. Some actors with more political experience and creative experience took material from China's reality and combined it with other conditions to create characters, so that the roles they played achieved a better combination of political and artistic qualities. Although some actors did not achieve higher achievements due to insufficient artistic cultivation, they no longer had the destructive problem of formalism.
　　The play has already been staged. With so much guidance and help, we are willing to continue to improve in constant criticism and strive to create a complete new artistic style.

### 我们是怎样排演“莫斯科性格”的

专栏：

　　我们是怎样排演“莫斯科性格”的
    卢肃执笔
    我们首先得感激领导上、苏联的朋友们及戏剧界的先进们，在排演“莫斯科性格”时，给予我们的指导和帮助。
    这是一个政治性与艺术性达到了高度的结合的剧本，它的背景是战后的五年计划的建设。它反映了将要进到共产主义的社会主义国家的经济建设中的一些问题。在观众感受的乐观的喜剧效果中，作者对失去新鲜事物感觉的波达波夫，给与了尖锐的严格的批评，并有力的批判了查切夫的盲目性。同时，作者也毫不放松的批判了其他任何人的任何缺点。但是假如我们排演的整个努力仅去着重表现故事中的突出事件——争论的中心点，而不去着重表现苏维埃人的高尚品质；只是表现出某些人的受批评，而不能表现他们高度自觉的自我批评的精神，那就会将事件歪曲了。所以，我们确定歌颂社会主义、歌颂莫斯科性格是第一位的，而批评则是进行在这个基础上的。事实上，剧本里虽然有严肃的斗争但是没有一个反派人物，没有一个被否定的人物，也就是说明着社会主义社会发展的动力，不再是阶级的斗争，而是批评与自我批评。
    在我们处理这个戏的时候还碰到一个关键性的问题。当我们初接触剧本时，曾有过一种简单片面的想法，认为结局只要波达波夫接受批评问题就解决了。这实在是一种对社会主义建设的错误认识。因为剧本的故事告诉我们，波达波夫的工厂在原来的基础上决定将五年计划在三年半内完成，已不是一件轻易的事，而是要用更紧张的劳动来解决的。因此，在这一原来的技术水平上，波达波夫是不能再接受另外的订货的。但在第三幕中，区委会通过了关于制造新机器的决定，并不是根据纺织厂一方面的要求，而是根据工程师克利伏胜彻底的研究了问题得出的科学结论：“将现在仍用手做的工作机械化，创造新的工作机器改善技术装备，改善工厂的运输工作。”这就是这个戏解决问题上的光辉的特点。这种思想贯通全剧，如在戏的结尾，格力涅夫、高尔本科、克利伏胜又在进行着另一个发明的计划，便说明了这种创造性就是社会主义的现实。
    排演上的另一个问题，是我们怎样克服演员、导演和剧本的距离的呢？我们演员的情形十分不一致（导演上也一样），政治修养、生活经验、艺术作风各不相同：有些是抗日战争中参加革命参加党的，有些则是自卫战争中参加革命的，有些则是北京解放后才参加工作的；单是在生活经验上说就有城市与乡村的不同，因此，要使这些演员（与导演），很好的去表现苏联的老布尔塞维克的性格，表现党内的思想斗争，表现苏联现社会中尖锐的主题，困难自然是极大的。
    为了要在现有基础上获得较好的效果，我们在筹备阶段，便组织了以徐誉同志等负责的“莫斯科性格”工作组，主要的工作是负责搜集材料，作为学习的准备。接着，又组织了以刘郁民同志执行的包括韩冰、殷振甲、卢肃在内的导演团和演员小组，在院方的领导下做第一步的学习。我们先学习苏联的经济建设，取得理解剧本故事人物的根据。进一步就从文艺作品和电影去学习苏联人民的品质。大家的学习热情很高，都认识到不将自己在政治上思想上提高一步，是没有办法演和导这个戏的。甚至有的新同志说：“等我演完莫斯科性格，我就要提出要求加入共产党了。”但是直至戏的上演，我们在这方面仍没有达到更高的成就。这因为一方面是时间过短；一方面是一个人的政治、思想水平的提高，毕竟不是可以一蹴而就的。我们还要继续努力。
    为了准确的表现剧本内容，我们在排演的初步阶段，并未强调喜剧风格问题，以免产生将人物丑化的偏向，而只强调表演的现实性，合理性。在这一阶段，演员都做了剧情研究，脚色分析，和单位目的的分析。
    这个戏是苏联戏，很显然，我们没有苏联的生活经验并且也无法去体验生活，但是正如后来周扬同志所指出的：社会主义社会人们的素质在新中国的人民，中国共产党的党员和干部中正在成长着。有些具有较多的政治经验，创作经验的演员，便从中国的现实里取材结合到其他的条件来创造人物，使得自己扮演的脚色得到政治性与艺术性较好的结合。虽然有的演员，由于艺术修养的不够，没有达到更高的成就，但是已没有那种破坏性的形式主义的毛病。
    戏是已经上演了，有这么多的指导和帮助，我们愿在不断批评中继续改进，为创造完整的艺术新风格而斗争。
