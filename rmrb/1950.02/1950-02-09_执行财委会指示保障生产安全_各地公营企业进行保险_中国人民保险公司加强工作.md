Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, February 7th: In order to enable state-owned and public enterprises in various regions to conduct production safely, avoid accidental losses, and smoothly implement the economic accounting system, the Financial and Economic Committee of the State Council of the Central People's Government issued a directive on November 23rd of last year, stipulating: 1. All state-owned, public enterprises, and warehouses in various regions must take out insurance with the People's Insurance Company of China and its agencies (with the enterprise unit as the insured unit), and accept the insurance company's guidance and supervision on insurance facilities. 2. The insurance expenses shall be included in the production costs. In the past month or so, more than ten state-owned and public enterprises and government agencies in Beijing, Tianjin, Nanchang and other places have taken out insurance with the local People's Insurance Company of China, including the Bank of China, Beijing Paper Mill, and Beijing Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Beijing; the Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau and Tianjin Trust Company in Tianjin; and the Nanchang Trust Company, Native Produce Company, and Telecommunications Bureau in Nanchang. In addition, twelve units including the Ministry of Heavy Industry, North China Department Store, People's Printing Factory, and Tsinghua University in Beijing, and four units including the Nanchang Salt Company, Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company, and Jiangxi Publishing Company are in contact for insurance. To cooperate with the growing business needs, the People's Insurance Company of China has respectively notified its regional companies and directly affiliated branches to step up the establishment of branches or agencies in provincial capitals and developed industrial and commercial locations, train a large number of cadres, and establish contact with state-owned and public enterprises within their jurisdiction to jointly work for the restoration of production and the protection of state property. The People's Insurance Company of China is the only state-owned insurance institution in New China, directly led by the People's Bank of China, and conducts water insurance, fire insurance, and personal insurance businesses. Since its establishment in Beijing on October 20th of last year, it has successively established five regional branches in East China, Central China, Northeast, Northwest, and Southwest, twelve branches including Tianjin and Harbin, seven offices including Tangshan and Southern Anhui, and four sub-offices including Anqing.
