Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, February 6th: TASS Moscow: The latest issue of *New Times* published an editorial entitled "The Prestige of the United Nations," stating: The effectiveness, influence, prestige, and power of the United Nations must be derived from its aims and purposes. Anyone who studies the activities of the United Nations is deeply convinced of how the Soviet Union and the People's Democracies have tirelessly and consistently striven to adhere to the aims and purposes stipulated in the United Nations Charter. Soviet foreign policy follows a consistent line: to strengthen the power and prestige of the United Nations to the highest degree.

However, it is well known that in the international arena, especially in the United Nations, there are two policy lines. One line is the democratic line, which aims to promote and strengthen peaceful cooperation between countries; the other is the line of the imperialist countries, which aims at a new world hegemony and flagrantly violates the United Nations Charter for the private interests of ambitious individuals.

This line of the US-British bloc has seriously damaged, and is seriously damaging, the prestige of the United Nations. It intends to undermine the foundation of the United Nations. The State Department systematically uses the votes of American servants and vassals to obstruct the United Nations from fulfilling its basic and important functions, such as the prohibition of atomic weapons and universal disarmament. In the various committees of the United Nations and its specialized organizations, one can see the same situation, namely, that the United States, with the help of its British partners and its vassals, is trying to turn these institutions into tools of imperialist conspiracies, the ultimate goal of which is to undermine international cooperation and prevent the United Nations from fulfilling its direct functions.

The extent to which the US ruling clique is dictatorial can be illustrated by the situation that occurred in the Security Council and other UN bodies in January 1950. Today, the legitimate government of the People's Republic of China has been established, yet allowing the agents of the shattered reactionary bandits to remain in the United Nations is an act of wanton lawlessness. The US State Department and US vassals stubbornly delaying this desperate situation is a direct provocation to democratic public opinion.

The position taken by the Soviet Union on this issue is strict, consistent, and based on principle. If the delegations participating in the United Nations do not represent legitimate governments, but represent bankrupt cliques abandoned by their people, then what will the United Nations become? If certain individuals illegally attend the relevant committees and pass resolutions, then what weight and authority can such decisions have? The Chinese people are extremely indignant at the situation created by the US delegation's use of dictatorial and high-handed means within the United Nations. Britain's position on this issue is correctly regarded by Chinese public opinion as "hypocritical and two-faced" because while Britain announced its readiness to establish diplomatic relations with the Chinese government, it abstained from voting in the Security Council, which in effect supported the Kuomintang clique.

We must ask why the State Department continues to support its Kuomintang puppets in the United Nations, placing itself in such an absurd and ridiculous situation before the world? Obviously, it is because the People's Republic of China has declared the defense of peace as its program, and the participation of the representatives of the People's Republic of China in the United Nations will undoubtedly strengthen the peace front and make it more difficult for the imperialists to carry out conspiracies in international organizations. Moreover, the US ruling clique is obviously unwilling to admit the failure of their adventurist policy in China and is planning to continue their conspiracy against the Chinese people. Acheson's recent speech at the National Press Club proves this particularly clearly. Washington is clearly planning to instigate bloody conflicts in Asian countries. That is why Washington politicians are so stubbornly trying to keep the Kuomintang swindlers in the United Nations.

The US-British ruling cliques, trapped by the just protests of the Soviet Union and the People's Democracies and by the anger of Chinese public opinion, are now trying to spread the notion through their newspapers that the Soviet attitude is "unwilling to cooperate" and wants to "split" the United Nations, etc.

These absurd slanders only expose the helpless annoyance of the Washington politicians. The policy of the Soviet Union and the People's Democracies, now and in the past, has always been motivated by the desire to maintain the prestige and power of the United Nations and to protect the United Nations from being harmed by imperialist politicians.

### 苏联和人民民主国家坚守原则  加强联合国权力和威信  美英保留国民党残匪代表于联合国，是破坏联合国基础的阴谋行动

　　苏联和人民民主国家坚守原则
    加强联合国权力和威信
    美英保留国民党残匪代表于联合国，是破坏联合国基础的阴谋行动
    【新华社北京六日电】塔斯社莫斯科讯：最近一期《新时代》以“联合国的威信”为题发表社论称：联合国的效能、影响、威信和权力，必须从它的目的与宗旨中获得。任何研究联合国活动的人，莫不深信苏联与人民民主国家，如何不屈不挠和始终一贯地为恪守联合国宪章所规定的目的与宗旨而努力。苏联外交政策遵循着一贯的方针：加强联合国权力和威信至最高度。
    然而人们都知道，在国际舞台上，特别是在联合国中，有着两条政策路线。一条路线就是民主路线，它的目的在于促进和加强各国之间的和平合作；另一条是帝国主义国家的路线，它的目的是为了新的世界霸权，为了野心家的私利而迥然违反联合国宪章。
    美英集团的这条路线，已经严重损害、并正在严重损害着联合国的威信。它打算破坏联合国的基础。国务院有系统地使用了美国仆从和附庸的票数，阻挠联合国履行其基本的与重要的职能，如禁止原子武器和普遍裁减军备。在联合国的各种委员会及其专门组织里面，可以看到一种同样的情景，即美国在它的英国伙伴及其附庸帮助下，试图把这些机构变为帝国主义的阴谋诡计的工具，其终极目的就是要破坏国际合作，不让联合国履行其直接的职能。
    美国统治集团专横到何等程度，可以在一九五○年一月间安理会和联合国其他各机构内所发生的情势上得到说明。今天中华人民共和国的合法政府既已成立，仍让已被粉碎的反动派匪帮的代理人留在联合国，这是目无法纪的狂妄行动。美国国务院与美国附庸顽固地拖延这个绝望的形势，这是对民主舆论的直接挑衅。
    苏联对此问题所采取的立场，是严格而一贯的，并且是建立在原则上的。如果参加联合国的代表团不是代表合法的政府，而代表已被他们的人民所遗弃的破产小集团，那末联合国将变成什么样子呢？如果有某些个人非法出席各有关委员会，并通过决议，那末，这种决定能有什么分量和权威呢？中国人民对于美国代表团使用专横与高压的手段在联合国内所造成的形势，至表愤慨。英国在这问题上的立场，被中国舆论正确地认为是“伪善和两面派”。因为英国在宣布它准备与中国政府建立外交关系的同时，它却在安理会弃权不投票，这实际上是支持了国民党集团。
    我们要问为什么国务院要继续支持其在联合国中的国民党傀儡，而在世界面前使它自己处在这种荒谬可笑的境地呢？显然是因为中华人民共和国已宣布以保卫和平作为它的纲领，中华人民共和国代表的参加联合国，无疑问地将加强和平阵线，并使得帝国主义者在国际组织中运用阴谋更加困难。而且美国统治集团也显然不愿承认他们在中国的冒险主义政策的失败，正在计划着继续他们反对中国人民的阴谋。艾奇逊最近在全国新闻俱乐部的演说，证明得格外清楚。华盛顿显然打算在亚洲各国鼓动流血冲突。这就是为什么华盛顿的政客们如此顽固地企图将国民党骗子保留在联合国内的原故。
    因苏联与人民民主国家的正义抗议，因中国舆论的愤怒，而陷于困境的美英统治集团，现正在努力通过它们的报纸来散播一种概念，说苏联的态度是“不愿意合作”，而要“分裂”联合国等等。
    这些荒谬的诽谤徒然暴露了华盛顿政客们无可奈何的恼怒。苏联与人民民主国家的方针，现在和过去一样，始终是出于愿意保持联合国的威信和权力，并将保护联合国，使它不再受帝国主义政客们的侵害。
