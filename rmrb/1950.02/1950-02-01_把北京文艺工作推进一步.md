　　Furthering the Literary and Artistic Work of Beijing
　　Li Bozhao

　　Chairman Mao taught us:

　　“As everyone knows, no matter what you do, if you do not understand the situation of the matter, its nature, and its relationship with other matters, you will not know the laws of that matter, you will not know how to do it, and you will not be able to do it well.”

　　In the spirit and method of this teaching, we summarize the literary and artistic work of Beijing over the past year, with the aim of advancing the literary and artistic work of Beijing in 1950.

　　Beijing was liberated. The People's Liberation Army entered the city, accompanied by a cultural army. They are a cultural force that has grown up in the revolutionary struggle under the education of Mao Zedong's literary and artistic thought and has been tempered for a long time. They are composed of the North China University Art Troupe, the North China People's Art Troupe, all armed forces propaganda teams, drama clubs, and the Youth Art Theatre, the North China Military Region Anti-Enemy Drama Society, and the Yan'an Peking Opera Research Institute, which came to Beijing later. Before and after entering the city, many literary and artistic workers joined our ranks, strengthening and expanding this cultural force. Relying on this force, a new look has emerged in Beijing's literary and artistic work.

　　　　　Workers' Drama, Songs, and Poems

　　The new urban literary and artistic activities are primarily aimed at workers. Before liberation, Beijing workers yearned for the yangge dance of the liberated areas and secretly practiced it. Soon after liberation, the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions opened workers' literary and artistic training classes, including twenty-four factories. The aim was to train workers who love literary and artistic work to become the backbone of factory literary and artistic popularization. After the National Congress of Literary and Art Workers, the Municipal Factory Literary and Artistic Work Committee was established, and a group of young literary and artistic workers from professional literary and artistic groups went to factories to provide guidance. They contacted workers, made friends, and aroused their interest in creation. Workers especially like to write and perform plays. Workers from the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant, the Shijingshan Power Plant, the 70th Ordnance Factory, the Changxindian Machinery Plant, the People's Printing Plant, the Xinhua Printing Plant, the Clothing Factory, the Qinghe Woolen Mill, the Mentougou Chengzi Mine, the Renli Carpet Company, and the Housheng Match Factory began to learn to use their own language to write about their own factories and educate themselves. Most of them adopted the method of "three cobblers make a Zhuge Liang." They extensively collected materials, selected topics, made outlines, and organized group discussions. They repeatedly studied, analyzed, and revised without being afraid of repetition. They would not give up until they produced a work. Worker creation is the engine of factory literary and artistic work. Workers' wisdom and creative genius have been discovered and have shown great power. They wrote, directed, and performed their own plays. They worked hard and practiced diligently. In the period of four months, workers and young literary and artistic workers who went to the factories collectively created forty-nine plays. According to the four statistics of the Factory Literary and Artistic Work Committee at the end of 1949: twenty-five spoken dramas, nine operas, twelve allegro plays, two living newspapers, one pantomime, and forty-four songs. Together with dances, drum lyrics, etc., there were a total of one hundred and five works. The better plays include *Forging and Welding Plant*, *Unite Together*, *Production Grows an Inch*, *Husband and Wife Buy Public Bonds*, *Drinking Water Never Forgets the Well Digger*, *December Fourteenth*, *Worker-Peasant-Soldier-Student-Merchant Great Unity*, etc.

　　In terms of song creation: the factory choir with a foundation will create more songs. Most of them participated in the music training courses established by the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions. The Shijingshan Power Plant and the Telecommunications Bureau have better choirs. They are unwilling to stay in singing old songs such as *The Sky in the Liberated Area*, *We Workers Have Power*, and *Unity is Strength*. The Shijingshan Power Plant choir has sixty-five members and a command group. The people who went to the factory to teach and practice singing once reached four hundred. They practiced thirty-seven new songs, including two excellent songs, with lyrics by worker Xia Baoyi and music by Liu Xing: *Coal Mining Song of the Power Plant* and *The Workers of the Power Plant Stand Up*. The situations in the Renli Factory, Xinhua Printing Plant, and Qinghe Woolen Mill are somewhat different. In the past, under the rule of the Kuomintang, many anesthetic poisons and yellow ditties were left behind. The singing and creation of new songs are facing difficulties. Now, old songs are gradually being replaced by new songs. The workers were disgusted and abandoned the old ways. They said:

　　"These songs are so vulgar! It's always the same old thing, let's throw away this rotten tune!"

　　In October 1949, the workers' joint performance encouraged the creation of new songs. At that time, I heard the power plant workers sing six new songs written by the workers themselves: *Ode to the Red Light*, *Good Brothers*, *The Heroes of the Power Plant Stand Up*, *I am a Communist Youth League Member, I am Glorious*, *Brothers, Work Hard*, *Our Family Power Plant*. Everyone welcomed it very much. Many workers said:

　　"Singing is really good, why can't we do it? They can create, can't we learn and practice writing?"

　　The Qinghe Woolen Mill wrote *Weaving Workers' Song*, the Changxindian Machinery Plant has *We are the Guards of the People's Factory*, *The Riveting Hammer Sounds Continuously*, the Clothing Factory has *We Make Clothes for Soldiers*, *Clothing Factory Work Rhymes*, the Housheng Match Factory has *Child Labor Rhymes*, etc. There are also many songs with new lyrics filled in old tunes.

　　The songs that workers like to sing are short and concise. The rhythm is strong, crisp, and powerful. The content is combined with the mood of production. They also like to write poetry. The initial poems were complaints, then they praised labor production, and when their awareness was higher, the position of workers as masters of the country became more prominent. Now, I have selected a few worker poems, which can show the simple style of new poetry. Such as:

　　"Picking up the bucket and singing a song,
　　Picking water to the bottom of the gully;
　　Some people laugh at me for wearing tattered clothes, (Note: Made acid and burned the clothes.)
　　Tattered clothes are for work."

　　Worker Guo Yubao picked up the temperature specific gravity meter, felt it was very precious, and everyone should take good care of it, so he wrote a poem:

　　"Temperature specific gravity meter,
　　Cannot do without making acid.
　　He knows the quality of the acid,
　　It is our good baby.
　　Good baby, keep it safe.
　　Don't break it."

　　When the workers of the nitric acid group picked up the shovels to add charcoal, they sang a poem casually:

　　"Pick up the shovel and sing a song,
　　Shovel coal and burn the nitric acid pot,
　　Today we two become partners,
　　Work hard and refuel."

　　Many workers sing worker poems when they are tired from work, and the fatigue is cured. This is the role of worker poems. Workers' drama, songs, and poems have a great impact on workers' production enthusiasm, improve productivity, and help complete production tasks.

　　　　　Opera Improvement

　　Opera improvement work has special significance in Beijing. Because Beijing is the birthplace of the New Culture Movement, and Beijing is also the fortress of feudal art; the capital city of feudal emperors of the past dynasties. According to the statistics of the Beijing Opera Improvement Section: there are more than 2,400 opera performers in the city, 48 troupes, 28 Peking Opera, 7 Ping Opera, more than 10 Amusement Clubs... How to inherit the essence of Beijing's past national culture and remove the dross of feudal art, the most specific task is brought to us. Everyone knows that Beijing is an ancient cultural capital with a rich treasure of national and folk art. Using Marxist-Leninist viewpoints and Mao Zedong Thought to sort it out and achieve "bringing forth the new through the old," critically accepting the heritage of national art is a difficult task. In the beginning, it is inevitable to be unfamiliar and unfamiliar, and we often do not learn well before we do it, but we learn after we do it. Therefore, this is a long-term thing. A matter for everyone in the opera world. It is by no means a matter for a few people. In the early days of entering the city, the Old Drama Department of the Cultural Management Committee, the Old Drama Section of the Municipal Cultural Committee, and the Opera Improvement Bureau under the Ministry of Culture after the establishment of the Central People's Government were all professional institutions engaged in opera improvement work, and they all made certain contributions. They will make even greater contributions in the future. However, the unfolding of the opera improvement movement gradually developed after the establishment of the opera training class. There were more than 2,000 people in the two sessions. Opera performers have received revolutionary ideological education, initially have class consciousness, and recognize that the views of the new and old societies on artists are different, and their social status is different. Opera artists are mental workers and part of the Chinese people. Their representatives, Mr. Mei Lanfang, Zhou Xinfang, Cheng Yanqiu, Yuan Xuefen, Lian Kuoru, etc., participated in the National Congress of Literary and Art Workers, the Political Consultative Conference, the Beijing People's Congress, and the National Women's Congress. They have political status. The awakening of the opera world is the fundamental driving force of the Beijing opera improvement movement. What is the impact of the works representing Chairman Mao's literary and artistic thought and the new literary and artistic workers on the opera world? Yangko Opera: *Brother and Sister Reclaiming Wasteland*, *Husband and Wife Literacy*, *Get Mobilized*, *The White-Haired Girl*, *Liu Hulan*, *Chiye River*, Qin Opera *Blood and Tears Revenge*, brought new things to Ping Opera and made Ping Opera partially change. The performance of *Nine-Tailed Fox* made Ping Opera reach a new record. *Forced to Liangshan*, *Three Attacks on Zhujiazhuang*, *Nine Pieces of Clothing*, *Red Maid*, brought new samples to Peking Opera and influenced the improvement of Peking Opera. The performance of *Ink Dai* shows that the collective improvement of famous actors, directors, authors, actors, and musicians has brought new changes to Peking Opera. New folk arts such as *Examining the Witch* and *Hundred Birds Facing the Phoenix* replaced some old folk arts. The new adaptation of *Water Margin* and *The Long March of the Red Army* made new folk arts develop.

　　New and old literary and artistic workers are communicating, exchanging, learning from each other's strengths and making up for their weaknesses, respecting each other, and promoting new developments in opera art.

　　　　　Mass Creation Research

　　The Beijing Mass Literary and Artistic Creation Research Association was established on October 15, 1949. In the past few months, the work has developed. There are 300 members. Judging from the origin of the members: workers are the most, followed by students. There are artists, staff, old writers, and freelancers. The organization is divided into seven groups: novels, dramas, folk arts, anecdotes, factory literature and art, student literature and art, and fine arts. A mass amusement club was established, with more than 20 artists who have undergone ideological training, singing new folk arts in two shows day and night. The audience has increased from dozens to hundreds, with a total of 21,815 listeners. Thirty-six evening parties were organized, with hundreds to 2,000 audiences each time.

　　In terms of mass creation: the plays include *New In-laws*, *Yuanbao Goes Home*, *People's Joy*, etc. The first two are New Year's small plays. The latter is based on the story of the Red Turban Uprising in the Yuan Dynasty. New folk art is the characteristic of mass creation and research. In the past three months, 84 new words have been rewritten and created. The content includes: reflecting workers' lives, praising combat heroes, describing people's heroes and peasants turning over, anti-feudal superstition, describing production saving models, military-civilian relations, Sino-Soviet friendship, and adapting folk stories.

　　In terms of editing and publishing: weekly magazines such as New Folk Art, New Fine Arts, New Beijing, New Drama, and Factory Literature and Art were edited. The *Mass Literature and Art Weekly* was compiled for the Tianjin Progressive Daily. A total of 620,000 words, six volumes of folk art series. One issue each of *Mass Literature and Art Newsletter* and *Speaking and Singing*, totaling 100,000 words.

　　★　　　　　　　★　　　　　　　★　　　　　　　★

　　The popularization of literary and artistic work has achieved preliminary results in the past year. The biggest shortcoming: lies in the fact that the principle of "popularization first" is not clear enough. More forces have not been organized to firmly implement the popularization of the literary and artistic movement.

　　Today, the foundation of Beijing's popularization of literary and artistic work has taken initial shape and has taken root. Judging from its development, the worker's literature and art representing the new literary and artistic direction is outstanding: it has created the literature and art of the worker masses. Whether it is in drama or poetry, new worker images have emerged, active builders of the new society. The direction of new literature and art has influenced and is influencing the improvement of Beijing opera. New literature and art represents the progressive revolutionary class, is forward-looking and scientific, and should be good at critically absorbing the excellent traditions of the nation, constantly enriching and developing itself. In turn, it gives opera improvement an influence and promotes its improvement; this is probably the relationship between new and old art and its internal connection. Those who are engaged in the popularization of literary and artistic work in Beijing and those who guide the popularization should recognize and grasp this point. Otherwise, there will be no progress.

　　The literary and artistic work of Beijing in 1950 is still the principle of popularization first. The enlightenment work of the broad masses of working people is urgently needed. It cannot be completed in the short term. If we ignore this point, we will lose the focus of literary and artistic work and make mistakes. Therefore, the foundation of popularizing literary and artistic work should be expanded and deepened, and closely coordinated with Beijing's production tasks. Pay attention not to forget the popularization of literary and artistic activities for hundreds of thousands of farmers in the suburbs of Beijing. Carry out popularization of literary and artistic work in a focused, planned, and organized manner. Open mass literary and artistic training schools to train cadres for the popularization of literary and artistic work.

　　The popularization of literary and artistic work urgently requires guidance. If the popularization of literary and artistic work stays at one level, and it is always the same thing year after year, then it will not be able to play a guiding role in popularization. If we ignore the masses' demand for guidance in popularizing literature and art, and do not understand that the relationship between popularization and improvement cannot be completely separated, and do not grasp the laws of the demand for guidance in popularizing literature and art, then we will be busy all year round and at a loss. The popularization workers should "improve year by year and month by month." How should they improve? Improve on the existing popularization foundation in Beijing. Improve and develop the twenty-five worker dramas, the nine worker operas, the twelve allegro plays, and the forty-four songs. Process and develop opera improvement and mass creation. Use these things to guide popularization. This requires literary and artistic workers to go deep into life, create, learn, rehearse, sort out, and strive to create new programs. At the same time, we should not ignore that cadres also need more advanced works. It should not be the end of the matter to bring out cold rice, hot rice, raw, and cooked food. This is called an irresponsible attitude. It must be improved and improved. We must put the main force of Beijing's literary and artistic work, professional groups and experts, into the place where the creative power is most vigorous, the life of the masses, as Chairman Mao warned us:

　　"Promising writers and artists must go to the masses, they must go to the workers, peasants and soldiers for a long time, unconditionally and wholeheartedly, to the fiery struggle, to the only and most extensive and richest source, to observe, experience, study, and analyze all people, all classes, all masses, all vivid forms of life and forms of struggle, all natural forms of literature and art, and then it is possible to enter the processing process, that is, the creative process, thus unifying raw materials and production, unifying the research process and the creative process!..."

　　Without new creation, there is nothing to popularize, let alone guide the popularization and talk about improvement. This is probably a general law. Beijing is an ancient cultural capital. We are delighted that the workers' masses, as the leading class of the Chinese revolution, have their own creations of literature and art. In addition, we have a rich treasure of national and folk art, and the deeper the excavation, the richer it will be. Mutual cooperation will promote the literary and artistic work of Beijing to move forward.

### 把北京文艺工作推进一步
李伯钊

专栏：

　　把北京文艺工作推进一步
    李伯钊毛主席教导我们说：
    “大家明白，不论做什么事，不懂得那件事的情形，它的性质，它与以外事情的关联，就不知道那件事情的规律，就不知道如何去做，就不能做好那件事。”
    我们本着这种精神和方法将北京市一年来的文艺工作加以总结，目的在将北京一九五○年的文艺工作向前推进一步。
    北京解放了。解放军入城，伴随武装部队入城的，还有一支文化部队。他们是在毛泽东文艺思想教育下，革命斗争中成长起来，久经锻炼的文化队伍。由华北大学文工团，华北人民文工团，所有武装部队的宣传队，剧社，以及稍迟来京的青年艺术剧院，华北军区抗敌剧社及延安平剧研究院等组成的。入城前后，不少的文艺工作者参加了我们的行列，这支文化队伍加强和扩大了，依靠了这个队伍，北京市的文艺工作出现了新的面貌。
            工人的戏剧，歌曲，诗篇
    城市新文艺活动是以工人为首要对象的，北京工人在解放之前，就向往解放区的秧歌，秘密地练习着。解放不久，市总工会即开设包括二十四个工厂的工人文艺训练班。训练爱好文艺工作的工人，使他们成为工厂文艺普及工作的骨干。在全国文代会后，全市的工厂文艺工作委员会成立，各专业文艺团体有一批青年文艺工作者下厂进行辅导工作。同工人接触，交朋友，引起他们对创作的兴趣。工人顶喜欢编剧，演戏。石景山钢铁厂，石景山发电厂，七十兵工厂，长辛店机厂，人民印刷厂，新华印刷厂，被服厂，清河制呢厂，门头沟城子矿，仁立地毯公司，厚生火柴厂的工人都开始学习用自己的语言，写自己工厂的事情，教育自己。大多数采取了“三个臭皮匠，凑个诸葛亮”的办法。广泛搜集材料，选择题目，做好提纲，组织小组讨论。不嫌重复的反复研究，分析，修改。不搞出作品不放手。工人创作是工厂文艺的发动机。工人的智慧与创作天才被发掘，显示了伟大的力量。自编，自导，自演。苦作苦练。在四个月的期间，工人和下厂的青年文艺工作者集体的创作了四十九个剧本。根据一九四九年年终，工厂文艺工作委员会四项统计：话剧二十五个，歌剧九个，快板剧十二个，活报二个，哑剧一个，歌曲四十四首。连同舞蹈、鼓词等共一百零五件作品。剧本中比较好的有《煅焊厂》，《团结在一起》，《生产长一寸》，《夫妻买公债》，《吃水不忘打井人》，《十二月十四那一天》，《工农兵学商大团结》等。
    在歌曲的创作方面：那个工厂的歌咏队有基础，那个工厂的歌曲便创作的多。他们大部分都参加过市总工会创办的音乐训练班的学习。以石景山发电厂，电信局的歌咏队比较好。他们不愿意停留在：《解放区的天》，《咱们工人有力量》，《团结就是力量》等老歌子的歌唱中。石景山发电厂的歌咏队，有六十五个队员，设有指挥小组，下厂教歌，练歌的人曾经达到四百人。练了三十七只新歌，其中有两首较优秀的歌子，是工人夏宝义词，刘行曲：《电厂挖煤歌》，《发电厂的工人站起来了》。仁立工厂，新华印刷厂，清河制呢厂的情形不同一些，过去在国民党统治下，遗留下不少的麻醉毒剂，黄色小调；新歌曲的歌唱与创作是遭受着困难的。现在逐渐以新歌曲代替了旧的。工人们厌恶的抛弃了老一套。他们说：
    “这些歌子多俗气呵！老这么一套，丢了这套烂调调吧！”
    一九四九年十月里，工人联合大演出，鼓励了创作新歌曲。当时听见发电厂工人自己演唱工人自己编的六支新歌：《红灯颂》，《哥俩儿好》，《发电厂的英雄们站起来》，《我是团员真光荣》，《兄弟们加油干》，《咱们的家庭发电厂》。大家都很欢迎。许多工人说：
    “唱的真好，我们为什么不能行呢？他们能创作，难道我们不能学着、练着写吗？”
    清河制呢厂编写了：《织呢工人歌》，长辛店机厂有《我们是人民工厂的保卫队》，《铆铁风锤响连声》，被服厂有《我们给战士做衣裳》，《被服厂工作谣》，厚生火柴厂有《童工谣》等。还有不少是旧曲填新词的歌。
    工人欢喜唱的歌，短小精干。节奏感强，干脆有力。内容和生产情绪结合。也欢喜写诗。开初的诗是诉苦，再就是歌颂劳动生产，等觉悟更高的时候，工人作为国家主人翁的地位就更显出了。现在检出几首工人诗，可以看出新诗朴素的风格。如：
    “挑起水桶唱起歌，
    挑水来到沟底坡；
    有人笑我穿的烂，（注：作酸把衣服烧破了。）
    烂衣原是为工作。”
    工人郭玉保拿起温度比重表，觉得很宝贵，大家应好好爱护，就写了一首诗：
    “温度比重表，
    做酸离不了。
    酸的质量他知道，
    它是我们的好宝宝。
    好宝宝，保存好。
    千万不可打坏了。”
    硝酸组的工人，拿起洋锹添炭的时候，顺口就唱出一首诗歌：
    “拿起洋锹唱起歌，
    铲起石炭烧硝锅，
    今日咱俩成伙伴，
    努力生产加油干”。
    有许多工人在工作疲倦的时候，就唱起工人诗来，疲倦也就治住了。这是工人诗的作用。工人的戏剧，歌曲，诗篇，对工人的生产热情影响极大，提高了生产力，帮助生产任务的完成。
            戏曲改进
    戏曲改进工作在北京有特殊的意义。因为，北京是新文化运动的发祥地，同时北京又是封建艺术的堡垒；历代封建帝王的京城。根据北京市戏曲改进科的统计：全市二千四百多戏曲艺人，四十八个班社，京剧二十八，评戏七，游艺社十余……如何继承北京以往民族文化的精华，去其封建艺术的渣滓，最具体的任务提到了我们面前。谁都晓得，北京是文化古都，有丰富民族、民间艺术的宝藏。用马列主义观点，毛泽东思想加以整理，做到“推陈出新”，批判的接受民族艺术的遗产，原是艰巨的工作。在开始的时候，难免生疏，不熟习，而我们又常常不是先学好了才干，而是干起来了再学。因之，这是长期的事情。戏曲界大家的事情。绝非少数人的事情。入城初期文管会旧剧处，市文委旧剧科，以及中央人民政府成立后，文化部所属的戏曲改进局，都是专业从事于戏曲改进工作的机关，都有其一定的贡献。今后将会有更大的贡献的。但作为戏曲改进运动的展开，是在创办戏曲界讲习班之后逐渐发展起来的。前后两期，共两千余人。戏曲艺人受了革命的思想教育，初步有了阶级觉悟，认清了新旧社会对待艺人的看法不同，社会地位不同。戏曲艺人是精神劳动者，中国人民的一部分。他们的代表梅兰芳、周信芳、程砚秋、袁雪芬、连阔如等先生参加了全国文代会，政治协商会，北京人民代表会，全国妇代会，他们有了政治地位。戏曲界的觉悟，是北京戏曲改进运动的根本动力。代表毛主席文艺思想的作品，和新文艺工作者对戏曲界的影响怎样呢？秧歌剧：《兄妹开荒》，《夫妻识字》，《动员起来》，《白毛女》，《刘胡兰》，《赤叶河》，秦腔《血泪仇》，给评剧带来了新的东西，使评剧部分改观了。《九尾狐》的上演，使评剧更达到新的纪录。《逼上梁山》，《三打祝家庄》，《九件衣》，《红娘子》，给京剧带来了新的样本，影响了京剧的改进。《墨黛》的上演，说明了名演员，导演，作者，演员，音乐工作者的集体改进，使京剧有了新的变化。《考神婆》、《百鸟朝凤》……等新曲艺，代替部分旧曲艺。新改编《水浒传》、《红军长征记》使新曲艺有新发展。
    新旧文学艺术工作者正在沟通，交流，取长补短，互相学习，彼此尊重，推进戏曲艺术新的发展。
            大众创作研究
    北京大众文艺创作研究会是一九四九年十月十五日成立的。数月来，工作有发展。会员三百名。就会员出身来看；工人最多，学生次之。有艺人、职员、旧作家、自由职业者。组织分小说、戏剧、曲艺、掌故、工厂文艺、学生文艺、美术等七组。成立了大众游艺社，有二十余位经过思想训练的艺人，日夜两场演唱新曲艺。观众由数十人增添到数百人，前后共有听众二万一千八百十五人。组织了三十六次晚会，每次观众数百至两千人。
    在大众创作方面：剧本有《新探亲家》，《元宝回家》，《万民欢》等，前两种是新年小戏。后一种是以元朝红巾起义故事写成的。新曲艺是大众创研会创作的特色。三个月来，改写、创作了八十四段新词。内容包括：反映工人生活，歌颂战斗英雄，描写人民英雄和农民翻身故事，反封建迷信，描写生产节约模范、军民关系、中苏友好，改编民间故事等。
    在编辑出版方面：编辑了新曲艺，新美术，新北京，新戏剧，工厂文艺等周刊。为天津进步日报编了《大众文艺周刊》。共六十二万字，曲艺丛书六集。《大众文艺通讯》，《说说唱唱》各一期，共十万字。
        ★                  ★              ★              ★
    一年来的文艺普及工作，有了初步收获。最大的缺点：在于执行“普及第一”的方针不够明确。没有组织更多的力量，坚定的贯彻普及文艺运动。
    今天，北京市文艺普及工作的基础，已初具规模，扎下了点根基。按其发展来看，代表新文艺方向的工人文艺是突出的：创作了工人群众的文艺。无论戏剧诗歌中出现了崭新的工人形象，新社会积极的建设者。新文艺的方向影响了与影响着北京戏曲的改进。新文艺代表进步的革命阶级，是前进的，科学的，要善于批判的吸取民族的优秀传统，不断丰富，发展自己。反过来又给戏曲改进以影响，推动其改进；这恐怕是新旧艺术的关连和其内在的联系。在北京从事文艺普及工作及其指导普及者，应该认识和掌握这一点。否则不能进步。
    一九五○年北京市的文艺工作，仍是普及第一的方针。广大劳动人民的启蒙工作是迫切需要的。非短期内可以完成，无视这点我们就会失掉文艺工作的重心，会犯错误的。因而普及文艺工作的基础要扩大加深，密切配合北京市的生产任务。注意不要忘了北京近郊数十万农民的普及文艺活动。有重点有计划有组织的深入文艺普及工作。开设群众文艺补习学校，培养文艺普及工作干部。
    文艺普及工作迫切要求指导。如果做普及文艺工作的死死的停留在一个水平上，年年月月总是一样的货色，那就起不了指导普及的作用。如果我们忽视群众普及文艺要求指导，不弄清楚普及与提高的关系是不能截然分开，不抓住普及文艺要求指导的规律，则我们将终年忙乱，不知所措。要求做普及工作者“逐年逐月的提高”，应该怎么提高呢？在北京现有的普及基础上提高。把二十五本工人话剧提高并发展它，把九本工人歌剧，十二本快板剧及四十四首歌曲提高一步并发展它。对戏曲改进、大众创作加工并发展它。拿这些东西来指导普及。这里要求文艺工作者深入生活，创作，学习，排演，整理，努力创造新的节目。同时，不应忽略干部也需要比较高级的作品，不应该冷饭，热饭，生的，熟的端了出来算完事，这叫不负责任的态度。必须加以提高与改善。我们要把北京市文艺工作的主力，专业团体与专家，投到创作力量最旺盛的地方，群众生活中去，如像毛主席告诫我们的：
    “有出息的文学家艺术家，必须到群众中去，必须长期地无条件地全心全意到工农兵群众中去，到火热的斗争中去，到唯一最广大最丰富的源泉中去，观察，体验，研究，分析一切人，一切阶级，一切群众，一切生动的生活形式斗争形式，一切自然形态的文学和艺术，然后才有可能进入加工过程即创作过程，这样把原料与生产，把研究过程和创作过程统一起来！……”
    没有新的创作，则没有东西去普及，更不能指导普及妄谈提高了。这恐怕是一条总的规律。北京是文化古都，我们欣喜已经出现了作为中国革命领导阶级的工人群众自己创作的文艺，加以我们有丰富民族民间艺术的宝藏，发掘的越深越丰富。互相配合推动北京文艺工作前进一步。
                一九五○年，一月二十九日，为纪念北京解放周年而作。
