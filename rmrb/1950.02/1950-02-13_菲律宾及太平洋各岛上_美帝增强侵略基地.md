Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, February 12th: American imperialists are stepping up the construction of military bases in the Philippines. According to a dispatch from the Kuomintang's Central News Agency citing military sources in Manila: In addition to maintaining a major air force base at Clark Air Base, the United States is now secretly enhancing existing US air force bases in the Philippines and secretly building new air force bases throughout the Philippines. In addition, according to a United Press dispatch from Manila, the US Embassy in the Philippines issued a statement on the 9th refuting the accusation by some Philippine congressmen that the United States had not provided the Philippines with "sufficient military assistance." The statement acknowledged that, under the 1947 "Military Assistance Agreement," the United States had provided the Philippines with $163.5 million worth of military supplies and equipment. The US Embassy stated that the United States had not only fulfilled the "obligations" stipulated in the agreement, "but has far exceeded these obligations."

Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, February 12th: The United States is greatly strengthening its aggression bases on various Pacific islands. According to a United Press dispatch from Okinawa, immediately after the "visit" to Okinawa by the US Joint Chiefs of Staff, Seitz, Governor and Commander of the Ryukyu Islands Military Government, declared on the 9th that the permanent construction plan for the US naval base on Okinawa would begin within two or three months. The US Congress had already allocated $70 million last year to carry out so-called "typhoon-proof permanent construction" on Okinawa. Furthermore, according to an Associated Press dispatch from Washington, the US Senate passed a bill on the 9th allocating funds for the construction of Pacific bases, authorizing the Department of Defense to use a huge sum of over $60 million to strengthen or build naval and air force bases on Pacific islands such as Okinawa, Guam, Kwajalein, and Johnston Island.

　　菲律宾及太平洋各岛上
    美帝增强侵略基地
    【新华社北京十二日电】美国帝国主义者正在菲律宾加强军事基地的建筑。据国民党中央社引马尼拉军方消息：美国除在克拉克机场保有主要空军基地外，现正秘密增强美国空军在菲原有的基地，并在菲律宾各地秘密建筑新空军基地。另据合众社马尼拉消息，美国驻菲大使馆九日发表声明，反驳菲律宾某些议员关于美国没有给予菲律宾以“充分军事援助”的指责。这个声明承认：根据一九四七年的“军事援助协定”，美国已交给菲律宾价值一亿六千三百五十万美元的军事供应品和装备。美大使馆称：美国不仅完成了协定所规定的“义务”，“并且远远地超过了这义务”。
    【新华社北京十二日电】美国正大事加强太平洋各岛屿的侵略基地。据合众社冲绳岛讯，紧接美四参谋长“访问”冲绳岛之后，琉球群岛军政府总督兼司令西兹即于九日宣称：冲绳岛美海军基地的永久建筑计划，将在二三月之内开始。按美国国会早在去年即已拨款七千万元，以供在冲绳岛从事所谓“不怕台风的永久性建筑”。另据美联社华盛顿消息，美参议院九日通过一项拨款建筑太平洋基地的议案，授权国防部以六千万美元以上的巨款，加强或兴建冲绳岛、关岛、瓜加林岛和约翰斯敦岛等太平洋岛屿的海空军基地。
