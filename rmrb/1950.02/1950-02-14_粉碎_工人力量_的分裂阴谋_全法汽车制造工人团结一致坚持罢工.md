　　Smashing the "Workers' Force" Split Conspiracy
    All French Auto Manufacturing Workers United in Insisting on Strike
    [Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 13th] TASS, Paris, 11th: The French automobile manufacturing workers, who unanimously went on strike on February 9th, demonstrated outstanding unity. Despite the leadership organs of the divisive "Workers' Force" and the French Christian Labor Confederation demanding that their members not stop work, their members still participated in the strike. Automobile manufacturing workers on strike in the Paris region held a mass rally at the Paris Winter Velodrome. André Reynaud, secretary of the Paris Region Metalworkers' Union Federation, paid tribute to the French dockworkers and railway workers, praising their heroism in the struggle to defend peace. He emphasized that the colonial war currently in Vietnam and the aggressive North Atlantic Treaty countries' preparations for a new world war are the main reasons for the plight of the French working people. Reynaud called on the working people to strengthen united action in the struggle to realize their just demands. Mass rallies of automobile manufacturing workers were also held in other parts of France.

　　粉碎“工人力量”的分裂阴谋
    全法汽车制造工人团结一致坚持罢工
    【新华社北京十三日电】塔斯社巴黎十一日讯：二月九日一致举行罢工的全法国汽车制造工人表现了出色的团结。尽管从事分裂的“工人力量”和法国基督教劳工联盟的领导机关要求它们的会员不要停工，但它们的会员仍然参加了罢工。巴黎区罢工的汽车制造工人，在巴黎冬季赛车场举行群众大会，巴黎区五金工会联合会书记安德莱·里纳向法国码头工人和铁路工人致敬，称颂他们在拥护和平的斗争中所表现的英勇精神。他强调指出，目前在越南的殖民战争和侵略性北大西洋公约国家的准备进行新的世界战争，乃是造成法国劳动人民困苦状况的主要原因。里纳号召劳动人民在争取实现其正义要求的斗争中加强一致行动。法国其他地方也举行了汽车制造工人的群众大会。
