Visiting the Tibetan Area - Labrang
Northwest Travelogue, Part 1
By Our Reporter Li Wen

Your reporter traveled southwest from Lanzhou, passing through Linxia to Labrang, which was recently liberated. Late November was still early winter, but the snow-capped mountains along the way and the rushing rivers accompanied by gusts of cold wind already made one feel the "frigid might" of the Northwest Plateau.

A Magnificent Northwest Town

Labrang gets its name from the famous Labrang Monastery located in the western suburbs of the city. It was later renamed Xiahe County. Situated in the upper reaches of the Daxia River, it is surrounded by mountains and water, with magnificent scenery. Climbing from the river valley to the top of the mountain, the Xiahe Plateau stretches out, appearing like a plain. However, its altitude is already three thousand five hundred meters. Xiahe administers a total of fourteen townships, with Tibetan farmers and herdsmen accounting for seventy and thirty percent respectively. West from here, via Ganjia to Qinghai, and south across Guoluo to reach Kang, are either broad valleys and gently sloping, spring-fed plateau basins, or vast natural pastures extending for hundreds of miles with abundant water and grass. Labrang is a combination of settled Tibetan farmers and nomadic Tibetan herders. Because it is located at the strategic intersection of the four provinces of Sichuan, Kang, Gansu, and Qinghai, and is also a major center for material exchange between Tibetan, Hui, and Han people, merchants from Lintao, Linxia, Lanzhou, and provinces such as Shaanxi and Henan often exchange cloth, flour, tea, and other goods for local specialties such as musk, lynx, butter, and fur. The main export of the area is fur, with an average annual output of around 2.3 million catties of wool, ranking first in Gansu Province, and making it one of the fur production centers of the Northwest.

Stagnated in Feudal Society

The economic, political, and social life of the people in the Labrang Tibetan area remains stagnant in the ancient state of feudal society. Politically, there are still traces of tribal organization. Although a county government was established here more than twenty years ago, until the recent liberation, the ruling power over the townships, except for a few directly administered streets such as the upper and lower "Tawa," remained in the hands of the monasteries or tribal "headmen." The leaders of each tribe are called "Guo Wa" (Tibetan, meaning headman) or "Hong Bu" (meaning official), and are commonly referred to by the Han people as "local officials." Some are hereditary, while others are appointed by the Labrang Monastery for a term of three years. The "headmen" of each tribe retain considerable ruling power over the Tibetan people. They have the power to handle and mediate civil disputes, judge civil cases, and dispatch "Ula" (i.e., corvée labor). Tibetan people take turns serving the headmen without pay, herding cattle and sheep, and cultivating land for them. When Tibetan people encounter a local official on the road, they immediately dismount, take off their hats, stand by the roadside, bow and clasp their hands, with the utmost respect.

Buddhism has a profound influence on the Tibetan people here, as it does on Tibetan people in other areas. Regardless of their wealth, Tibetan people enshrine a Buddhist altar in their homes, and if there are major events such as weddings or funerals, they обязательно invite lamas to chant sutras. On the first and fifteenth days of each lunar month, they rush to nearby monasteries to worship Buddha. Those living near monasteries often take time out of their busy schedules to go to the monastery to turn the "Mani" (i.e., prayer wheel), and some even recite the six-character mantra "Om Mani Padme Hum" dozens of times before meals. Some recite sutras while working. Many Tibetan people spend their days saving every penny, donating all their savings to the living Buddhas of the monasteries. Some travel thousands of miles, taking years or decades of savings, to worship Buddha at the Lhasa Monastery in Tibet, a journey that takes months. Often, one pilgrimage to Buddha leaves them destitute. Tibetan people often wear small silver boxes on their chests, containing photos and hair of the "Living Buddha," or red and green silk ribbons given by the "Living Buddha." Due to the integration of politics and religion, the monasteries hold real power, lamas do not work but eat, and under the influence of religious superstition, many young and middle-aged men among the Tibetan people are absorbed into the monasteries to become lamas. In Xiahe, there are more than 53,000 Tibetan people, with a total of thirty-six monasteries, with approximately 5,600 lamas, accounting for over ten percent of the total population.

Due to the large number of young and middle-aged men becoming lamas, the Tibetan birth rate has greatly decreased (disorderly sex lives among Tibetan men and women, a high prevalence of venereal diseases, and a high mortality rate among middle-aged men are also reasons for the population decline). During the Han and Tang dynasties, the areas of today's Linxia and Kangle were all Tibetan regions. Now, the Tibetan people have retreated to beyond Tumen Pass, eighty li southwest of Linxia. Tumen Pass has become the boundary between the Han, Hui, and Tibetan peoples, and there is little trace of Tibetan activity within Tumen Pass.

Monastery lamas also engage in business or lending. During the Kuomintang rule, most Tibetan people, due to heavy taxes and miscellaneous levies, were unable to maintain even a basic standard of living despite working year-round, and often borrowed high-interest loans from lamas to survive.

Most Tibetan People Live in Poverty

Most Tibetan people live in extreme poverty. In agricultural areas, the main food is highland barley (a cold-resistant type of wheat), followed by peas and broad beans. More than 70% of the land is owned by monasteries and local officials. Tibetan tenant farmers generally have to pay half of their total harvest to the monasteries or local officials as rent. What remains for the farmers can only sustain them for three to five months, so they find work for others or engage in small businesses to supplement their income. Herders still live a nomadic life, moving with the water and grass. The majority of herders are poor, owning only six or seven cattle and twenty or thirty sheep. Middle-class herders own twenty or thirty cattle and hundreds of sheep. A very few local officials or wealthy families own thousands of cattle and thousands of sheep. Children of poor herders often work as servants for wealthy families, or tend to their cattle and sheep. Tibetan people generally eat tsampa (roasted highland barley flour), butter, beef and mutton, rock salt, and tea as regular food. Herders eat more meat. Poor settled Tibetan people do not often eat butter, and only eat three meals of tea and tsampa each day. Because the area is high and cold, with snow throughout the year, Tibetan people of all ages, men and women, wear old sheepskin coats all year round. Wealthy families often use silk or black foreign cloth as the outer layer, and trim the collar and edges with valuable otter fur. Wealthier families often wear a silk shirt. Poor Tibetan people only wear a leather tube, without decoration, and do not wear an undershirt. Tibetan people are accustomed to not wearing lower garments, men and women alike. Because Labrang is close to the Hui and Han people of the interior, and the exchange of cloth is more convenient, some Tibetan men and women have the habit of wearing lower garments.

Women Work Harder Than Men

Whether in agricultural or pastoral areas, Tibetan women are diligent in their work. Men in agricultural areas do not plow the fields. Apart from participating in cultivating the land, the main labor of harvesting, threshing, hoeing, and grinding highland barley is done by women. Women in nomadic areas do heavy labor such as milking cows, making butter, making felt blankets, and collecting dung (cow and sheep dung are the main firewood in nomadic areas). Men only participate with women in herding cattle and sheep. Tibetan men like to be armed, and even those from poor families try to buy guns. A horse and a gun, those who can ride and hunt are called "strong men." Because women work harder than men, in some families, women hold economic power, and their status in the family is also high. Tibetan women have a lower status in religious matters (women are not allowed to enter monasteries on weekdays) and in political participation (all tribal local officials are men), but they enjoy equal status with men in marriage and inheritance rights. In the Tibetan area, only the marriages of a few local official's children are restricted, with their parents choosing spouses from families of equal status, implying the political meaning of wooing other tribes. Marriages between ordinary Tibetan men and women are free. Premarital sex is relatively disorganized in the Tibetan area, but after marriage, they must strictly observe chastity. There were originally no professional prostitutes in the general Tibetan area, but due to the establishment of Kuomintang bureaucratic institutions in Labrang, many prostitutes had already appeared before liberation.

Inconvenient Transportation and Backward Commerce

Labrang still maintains the ancient custom of "markets at midday." Although there are some shops on the streets of the city, the main trading place is still an area in front of the Labrang Monastery, which the Tibetan people call "Cong La." Tibetan people drive cattle and sheep, carrying precious specialties such as musk and lynx, from Qinghai, Xikang, northern Sichuan, and other places. Hui and Han merchants bring cloth, silk, tea, jewelry, and other miscellaneous goods to trade with each other. Hui and Han merchants often take advantage of the inconvenient transportation and the imbalance of supply and demand to seek huge profits. For example, a foot of foreign cloth costs more than 1,000 yuan in Xi'an, but can be sold for more than 5,000 yuan here. A musk pod costs about four silver yuan here, but can be sold for about twenty yuan in Xi'an.

Mao Zedong's Glory Shines on the Tibetan Area

Now, Mao Zedong's glory shines on the Labrang Tibetan area. Here are lush grasslands, here are hardworking and brave people. When the people are aware of striving for their own happy life, we can be sure that this "medieval society" that has developed little for decades or centuries will leap forward.

　　访问藏族区—拉卜楞
    西北旅行通讯之一
    本报记者  力文
    记者自兰州西南行，经临夏至解放不久的拉卜楞。十一月下旬还是初冬天气，但见沿途山巅积雪皑皑，河谷激流伴送着阵阵寒风，已令人感到西北高原的“寒威”了。
  壮丽的西北重镇
    拉卜楞因市区西郊有著名的拉卜楞寺而得名，后更名夏河县。位居大夏河上游，山环水绕，景色壮丽。自河谷攀登山巅，远望夏河高原，坦坦荡荡，恍如平原。但其海拔已有三千五百公尺。夏河共辖十四乡镇，藏族农民与牧民的比例为百分之七十比三十。由此西经甘加至青海，南越果洛达川康，或为谷广坡平、流泉萦绕的高原盆地，或为广阔数百里，水草丰茂之天然牧场，拉卜楞则为定居藏民与畜牧藏民的结合地。因地当川康甘青四省要冲，又为藏民与回汉人民物资交流之一大中心，临洮、临夏、兰州及陕、豫等省商人，常以布匹、面粉、茶叶等换取此地特产之麝香、猞猁、酥油、皮毛等，当地输出以皮毛为大宗，羊毛产额每年平均在二百三十万斤左右，居甘省第一位，为西北皮毛出产中心之一。
  停滞在在封建社会
    拉卜楞藏区人民的经济、政治和社会生活仍停滞在古老的封建社会的状态。政治上还有部落的痕迹。此地虽设立县治二十余年，但直到此次解放前，除直辖的上下“他哇”等几条街道外，其他乡镇的统治权力，仍操在寺院或部落“头人”手中。各部落的首领，称之为“郭哇”（藏语，意为头人）或“洪布”（即官），汉人统称之为土官，有的为祖传世袭，有的由拉卜楞大寺派任，任期三年。各部落“头人”，对藏民保有相当大的统治权力，他们有权处理调解民间纠纷，判决民事案件，派遣“乌拉”（即差役）。藏民轮流无代价地为头人服役，代头人牧养牛羊，耕种土地。藏民途中如遇土官，立即下马脱帽，立道旁，鞠躬拱手，必恭必敬。
    佛教对此间藏民与其他地区藏民一样有深厚的影响。藏民不论穷富，家中均供奉佛位，如有婚丧大事，必延请喇嘛念经。每逢朔望日便赶赴附近寺院拜佛。家居寺院附近者，更常常忙中抽闲，前往寺院转“摩尼”（即经轮），有的还在饭前念“唵嘛呢叭咪吽”六字真言数十遍。有的是一面劳作一面念经。更有不少藏民终日省吃俭用，将平日积蓄倾囊捐献给寺院活佛。有的则持数年或十数年的积蓄，跋涉数千里，远赴西藏拉萨寺拜佛，往返数月，往往朝佛一次，即行倾家荡产。藏民胸前多佩戴小银匣，匣中藏有“活佛”的像片、头发，或“活佛”所赐的红绿绸布条。由于政教不分，寺院握有统治的实权，喇嘛均不劳而食，以及宗教迷信的影响，藏民中之青壮男子多被吸收入寺当喇嘛。夏河全境藏民为五万三千余人，境内计有三十六个寺院，共约喇嘛五千六百余人，喇嘛占总人口百分之十强。
    由于大批青壮年男子充当喇嘛，藏族生殖率大减（藏民男女性生活较乱，花柳病较多，中年男子死亡率大，也是人口减少的原因）。汉唐时代，今之临夏、康乐一带均为藏民区域，现在藏民已退至临夏西南八十里土门关以外，土门关成为汉回与藏民的分界地，土门关内很少有藏民活动的踪迹。
    寺院喇嘛也经商或放账，在国民党统治时期，一般藏民由于苛捐杂税繁重，终年劳动不得温饱，多向喇嘛借高利贷维持生活。
  藏民生活大半贫苦
    藏民生活大多非常贫苦。在农业区，以种植青棵（一种耐寒麦）为主要食物，其次是碗豆蚕豆之类。百分之七十以上的土地为寺院及土官所有，藏民佃户一般须向寺院或土官缴纳全部收获的半数作为租金。农民所余仅能维持三五个月的生活，于是便替别人揽工或作些小本生意，补助生活的不足。牧民仍过着逐水草而居的生活，贫苦牧民居大多数，他们仅具有六七头牛，二三十只羊。中等牧民拥有二三十头牛，数百只羊。极少数的土官或富裕之家，则拥有上千头牛，及数千只羊的财富。贫苦牧民子弟多为富家当佣工，或代养富家之牛羊。一般藏民以?粑（用青棵炒熟的炒面）、酥油、牛羊肉、青盐和茶叶为经常食物。牧民食肉较多。贫苦的定居藏民连酥油也不常吃到，每日仅吃三顿茶和?粑。此间因地高天寒，终年见雪，藏民中不论男女老少，一年四季均穿一件老羊皮袄。富家人常以绸缎或黑洋布缝为衣面，并以贵重的水獭皮镶衣领与衣边，较富人家多穿一件绸衬衫。穷苦藏民则只穿一个皮筒子，上面无装饰，并不穿衬衣。藏民习惯男女均不着下衣，拉卜楞因多与内地回汉人民接近，布匹交换较为方便，部分藏民男女已有穿下衣的习惯了。
        妇女劳动优于男子
    不论农业区与畜牧区，藏族妇女都勤于劳动。农业区的男子不会锄田，除参加耕种土地外，其他收割、打场、锄田、磨青棵等主要劳动均为妇女操作。游牧区的妇女操作挤牛奶、制酥油、制毡毯、拾粪（牛羊粪为游牧区主要烧柴）等繁重劳动，男子只与妇女共同参加看牧牛羊。藏民男子好武装，家庭贫苦者亦尽量设法购买枪枝。一马一枪，能骑马射猎者称为“壮人”。由于妇女劳动优于男子，在某些家庭中，妇女握有经济权，其在家庭中的地位亦高。藏族妇女在宗教问题（妇女平日不得入寺院）、参政问题上（各部落土官均系男子），地位是低微的，但在婚姻问题与财产继承权上，与男子享有平等地位。在藏区，只有少数土官子女的婚姻受限制，其父母代为择婚于“门当户对”之家，含有拉拢其他部落的政治意味。一般藏民男女婚姻是自由的。藏区未婚男女的性生活较乱，但结婚后则必严守贞操。一般藏区本无职业妓女，但拉卜楞由于曾经建立过国民党的官僚机构，解放前，已经出现了不少妓女。
        交通不便商业落后
    拉卜楞仍保持着“日中为市”的古风。虽然市区街道上有些商店，但主要交易场所还是在拉卜楞大寺前的一块地方，藏民称之为“丛拉”。藏民赶着牛羊，携带麝香、猞猁等珍贵特产，来自青海、西康、川北等地，回汉商人则带着布匹、绸缎、茶叶、首饰及其他杂货，互相交易。回汉商人常利用交通不便，供不应求的情况谋取厚利。比如西安买洋布一尺需人民币一千余元，此地可卖五千余元，此地一个麝香需银洋四元左右，至西安则可卖二十元左右。
  毛泽东的光辉普照藏区
    现在，毛泽东的光辉普照在拉卜楞藏区了。这里有丰茂的草原，这里有勤劳、勇敢的人民，当人民自觉到为自己康乐生活而努力奋斗的时候，我们可以确信，这个数十年、数百年很少发展的“中古社会”会飞跃前进的。
