　　On Anti-Smuggling Work
　　Guan Shuixin
　　With the exception of Tibet, mainland China is now entirely liberated. This comprehensive unification of China has enabled tax collection to gradually enter a normal state. However, since many large cities have only recently been liberated, tax collection agencies are not yet fully established, the objects of taxation are very complex, and tax personnel do not have a sufficient understanding of industry and commerce. This provides many industrialists and businessmen with opportunities to evade taxes. In particular, the long-term rule of the enemy puppets and the Kuomintang reactionary government has fostered bad habits of tax evasion among many industrialists and businessmen, creating a major difficulty in today's tax collection work. Therefore, today's anti-smuggling work should become an important part of tax collection. The Beijing Municipal Taxation Bureau investigated and dealt with as many as 18,461 cases of violations in nine months last year, which is a significant example.
　　The past inspection and anti-smuggling work was a bureaucratic system that was both troublesome and prone to corruption. The more troublesome it was, the easier it was to engage in corruption, and the easier it was to engage in corruption, the more it fostered a climate of tax evasion. Although the penalties in the tax law were harsh, even regardless of the tax evader's motives, the amount of tax evaded, and the degree of first-time or repeat offenses, the entire amount of evaded goods was often confiscated and turned over to the public, or a fine of one or even several times the amount of the evaded tax was imposed, which was both unreasonable and inhumane. However, due to collusion between officials and merchants, and rampant bribery, tax laws in many places remained nothing more than empty words, and tax evasion could not be stopped.
　　This phenomenon should not continue to exist in the new China today. The inspection work of the new China must not only be strict and the anti-smuggling work cautious, but the handling must also be reasonable. Inspection work, due to the large collection surface and complex situation in cities, is clearly not sufficient to rely solely on tax personnel. Therefore, on the one hand, it is necessary to establish close contact with relevant agencies such as postal and telecommunications, customs, transportation, garrison troops, public security agencies...etc.; on the other hand, it is also necessary to mobilize the masses in various ways to assist in the work. In particular, mass anti-smuggling efforts have proven very effective in areas that have been liberated for a long time. Anti-smuggling must be cautious, because many people who are accustomed to evading taxes are the most capable of finding opportunities to exploit loopholes. Staff must spare no effort to block loopholes from many aspects, so that they have no loopholes to exploit. At the same time, anti-smuggling work must be handled carefully, and the slightest carelessness can easily cause disturbances and affect the activities of legitimate industrialists and businessmen. Therefore, the handling of cases must have priorities and proportions, so as to be neither indulgent nor disruptive, so that bad people are alerted and good people are protected. The punishment of tax evaders should be a form of political education, so that they understand that tax evasion is harmful to the interests of the country and the people, and that the state's anti-smuggling efforts are precisely to protect the legitimate operations of industrialists and businessmen. As for the punishment of tax evaders, it is necessary to have a stance and distinctions, to distinguish the different motivations for tax evasion, the differences between repeat offenders and first-time offenders, and the different amounts of tax evaded, etc., and to impose different punishments accordingly. It must never be excessive, and it must never be solely for the purpose of fine revenue. Fines are merely a means of preventing smuggling, not the purpose of our punishment.
　　In the current rectification of tax collection, inspection and anti-smuggling work is indeed an important link. If used properly, it will play a great role in tax collection. Therefore, how to further establish close contact with all parties, how to mobilize the masses to assist in the work, how to take the initiative to prevent smuggling, and how to conduct political education in the handling of cases... these issues are worth detailed study by the tax authorities, and should be resolved in a planned manner.

　　谈缉私工作
　　关水心
    目前中国大陆除西藏一隅外已经全部解放。中国这种全面统一的形势，使税收工作也逐渐步入常轨。但是由于许多大城市刚解放不久，税收机构不健全，征课对象很复杂，加上税收工作人员对工商业情况了解得不够充分，给不少工商业者一个逃税漏税的机会。特别是由于过去敌伪和国民党反动政府的长期统治，养成了许多工商业者逃税漏税的不良习惯，造成今天税收工作中一个很大的困难。因此，今天的缉私工作应成为税收工作中一个重要部分。北京市税务局在去年九个月中，共查获处理违章案件达一万八千四百六十一件之多，就是一个显著的例子。
    过去的稽查缉私工作，是既麻烦又便于舞弊的一种官僚制度。越麻烦就越好舞弊，越好舞弊就越助长偷关漏税的风气。虽然税法上的罚则严苛，甚至不问偷税者动机怎样，漏税额数多少，以及初犯累犯的程度不同，动辄将全部漏税货品没收充公，或者处以漏税额一倍乃至几倍的罚金，既不近情，又不合理。但是由于官商勾结，贿赂成风。许多地方税法仍不过是一纸空文，漏税现象始终无法遏止。
    这种现象在今日新中国是不应继续存在的。新中国的稽查工作不仅要稽查严密，缉私谨慎，而且要处理合理。稽查工作，由于城市征课面大，情形复杂，单靠税务工作人员来进行，显然是不够的。所以一方面要与有关机关如邮电、海关、交通运输、驻防部队、公安机构……等取得紧密联系；一方面还要用各种各样的方式发动群众来协助工作。特别是群众性的缉私，在解放较久的地区都已证明很有成效。缉私必须谨慎，因为许多惯于偷税的人，是最能找机会钻空子的。工作人员必须不辞劳苦从多方面来堵塞漏洞，使他们无空子可钻。同时缉私工作必须慎重将事，稍有不慎，最容易引起滋扰，影响到正当工商业者的活动。因此对于案件的处理必须有重点有分寸。做到不纵不扰。使坏人有所警惕，好人得到保护。对于偷税者的处分，应当成一种政治教育。使他们明白偷税行为是损害国家和人民利益的，国家的缉私正是为的保护工商业者的正当营业。至于对偷税者的处分，必要有立场，有分别，要区别偷税动机的不同，累犯初犯的不同以及偷税多少不同等等，分别加以不同的处分。决不可过分，决不可单纯为了罚款收入。罚款不过是防止走私的一种手段，不是我们处分的目的。
    在目前整顿税收中，稽查缉私工作的确是重要的一环。运用得当，对税收将起很大作用。因此，如何进一步与各方面取得紧密联系，如何发动群众协助工作，如何争取主动防止走私，如何在处理案件中进行政治教育……，这些问题，税务当局是值得详细研究，并应有计划的来解决。
