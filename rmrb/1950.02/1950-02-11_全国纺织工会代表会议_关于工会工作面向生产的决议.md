Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, February 10th:
The National Textile Workers' Union Representatives Conference passed the "Resolution on Union Work Oriented Towards Production" on January 10th, which was approved by the Standing Committee of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions. The full text is as follows:

The National Textile Workers' Union Representatives Conference believes that under the current circumstances of national financial difficulties and insufficient raw cotton, it is the glorious and arduous task of all textile workers in the country to adopt the attitude of masters of the country, to make every effort to overcome the current difficulties, to prepare for the development of textile production, and to accumulate funds for heavy industry construction. Developing production is the highest interest of the working class. Therefore, union work must be oriented towards production, and all work is for the purpose of improving quality, eliminating waste, saving raw materials, improving efficiency, and reducing costs. Whether production can be done well is not only the responsibility of the administration, but also the responsibility of the union. Any view that does not care about production or believes that the union is merely helping from the sidelines is wrong.

  I. The union should organize all workers to strive to complete and exceed the national production plan. To this end, it must help workers formulate personal and collective production plans according to their own business, sign liaison contracts between production groups and workshops, and organize production and savings competitions to complete and exceed the plan.

  II. Actively study and participate in the formulation of scientific economic accounting systems and operating standards, implement standard quotas, and encourage the implementation of piece-rate wages and reward systems based on labor, more pay for more work.

  III. The union must strengthen education work, continuously improve the workers' class consciousness, enable them to establish a new labor attitude, consciously abide by labor discipline, cherish the factory, organize inventions, creations, and rationalization proposals, promote technical learning, exchange and promote the experience of advanced workers, and use mass production movements from bottom to top to achieve the purpose of production savings and overcoming difficulties.

  IV. Finally, union cadres must go into production, learn to lead production, and the union can only do a good job in production work to ensure and gradually improve the daily life of workers, and the work steps of the union and the administration can be consistent.

In order to achieve the goal of mutual benefit between labor and capital and the development of production, the basic spirit of this resolution also applies to the union work of private textile factories.

　　全国纺织工会代表会议
    关于工会工作面向生产的决议
    【新华社北京十日电】全国纺织工会代表会议于一月十日通过并经中华全国总工会常委会议批准的“关于工会工作面向生产的决议”，全文如下：
    全国纺织工会代表会议认为在目前国家财政困难、原棉不足的情况下，以国家主人翁的姿态，竭尽一切努力，克服当前困难，准备发展纺织生产，为重工业建设积累资金，乃是全国纺织职工光荣而艰巨的任务。发展生产就是工人阶级的最高利益。因而工会工作必须面向生产，一切工作都是为了改进质量、消灭浪费、节约原料、提高效率、减低成本。生产能否搞好，不仅是行政的责任，同时也是工会的责任。任何不关心生产或认为工会仅仅是从旁帮助的观点都是错误的。
    一、工会应组织全体职工为完成并超过国家生产计划而斗争，为此，必须帮助职工按本身业务制定个人的和集体的生产计划，签订各个生产小组以及车间之间的联系合同，组织完成与超过计划的生产节约竞赛。
    二、积极研究并参加制订科学的经济核算制度与经营标准、实施标准定额，以及鼓励生产的按劳付酬、多劳多得的计件工资与奖励制度。
    三、工会必须加强教育工作，不断地提高职工阶级觉悟，使其树立新的劳动态度，自觉遵守劳动纪律，爱护工厂，组织发明、创造、合理化建议，提倡技术学习，交流推广先进工作者经验，以自下而上的群众性的生产运动，来达到生产节约、克服困难的目的。
    四、最后，工会干部必须钻到生产中去，学习领导生产，工会只有把生产工作作好，才能保证和逐步改善工人的日常生活，工会与行政的工作步调也才能一致。
    为了达到劳资两利、发展生产的目的，这一决议的基本精神也适用于私营纺织厂的工会工作。
