　　New Symbol of Internationalism, New Milestone of Sino-Soviet Friendship
    Qian Duansheng
    The Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance, and Mutual Assistance, the agreement on the Changchun Railway and Lushun-Dalian, and the agreement on the Soviet government's economic loan to the Chinese government were signed by the foreign ministers of the two countries in Moscow the day before yesterday (February 14th) and announced simultaneously in the capitals of China and the Soviet Union yesterday. It is inevitable that the entire Chinese people will rejoice, the people of China and the Soviet Union will join hands and shout slogans, the people of people's democratic countries will unanimously welcome it, and progressive people all over the world will applaud.
    The text of the treaty and agreements themselves are filled with deep friendship, and the spirit on which these friendly provisions are based, the significance they contain, and the effects they will inevitably produce are even more great and important.
    Undoubtedly, due to this treaty and these two agreements, the construction of the new China will proceed smoothly and at an accelerated pace, the international status of the new China will be significantly improved, and the revolutionary regime of the new China will be incomparably consolidated. Undoubtedly, Sino-Soviet friendship and cooperation will have great development. Undoubtedly, peace in the East and the entire world will have a strong guarantee. And undoubtedly, the internationalism advocated by Marx and Engels, developed by Lenin and Stalin, and personally practiced by Chairman Mao among the incomparably vast number of people in the East will be widely disseminated. These are already or will become ironclad facts, heard by all and seen by all. The rumor-mongering imperialists will only continuously slap themselves in the face, exposing their true colors as rumor demons.
    Precisely because the spirit on which these three treaties and agreements are based is incomparably great, the significance they contain is incomparably profound, and the effects they will produce are incomparably important, merely emphasizing one beneficial undertaking, whether it is assistance in the construction of the new China, the enhancement of the new China's international status, the consolidation of the new China's revolutionary regime, the development of Sino-Soviet friendship, the safeguarding of world peace, or the promotion of internationalism, is not sufficient to fully evaluate these three treaties and agreements.
    Solely from the text of the treaty and agreements themselves, the following three points are very clear and should be recognized.
    First, it should be pointed out that the Treaty of Friendship, Alliance, and Mutual Assistance emphasizes the establishment of an anti-aggression alliance to strive for security and peace. The common enemy of China and the Soviet Union was previously the Japanese aggressors, and in the future, it is still necessary to prevent the re-aggression of Japan or those who collude with it (Article 1). For this purpose, China and the Soviet Union must naturally strive to jointly conclude a peace treaty with Japan in the shortest possible time (Article 2). To extend the same purpose, the two countries must naturally abide by the alliance and consult on major international issues related to common interests (Articles 3 and 4).
    An anti-aggression alliance is absolutely necessary, beneficial to China and the Soviet Union, and also beneficial to the people of Japan and the people of the whole world. Do not think that Japan is a defeated country and unable to re-invade China and the Soviet Union and re-harm the people of China and the Soviet Union. On the contrary, Japanese fascists, with the support of US imperialists, still exist and are still growing. US imperialists are using Japan as a base, stationing a large number of naval, land, and air forces, and permitting the disguised reconstruction of the Japanese navy and army. China and the Soviet Union must prevent all possible attempts at aggression and actions to undermine peace.
    The 1945 Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship and Alliance and other agreements were basically for the same purpose. At that time, Japanese imperialists had not yet been defeated. The Sino-Soviet alliance was to defeat Japan. To defeat Japan and give the enemy's Kwantung Army a fatal blow, the Soviet Union, which possessed strong armed forces, naturally should obtain the necessary conveniences on the key transportation routes in the Northeast—the Changchun Railway—and in the main seaports—Lushun and Dalian. Now, due to the establishment of the People's Republic of China, the rise of the Chinese people's strength, and the possibility of sincere cooperation between China and the Soviet Union, "the situation in the Far East has undergone fundamental changes," and the Soviet Union can no longer encounter negative resistance or active betrayal by reactionary regimes such as the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang. China and the Soviet Union have agreed to transfer all rights and property related to the three to Chinese ownership.
    However, we must still remember that our main purpose is to jointly maintain peace and defend against aggression. Before the conclusion of a peace treaty with Japan—a peace treaty that truly conforms to the Potsdam Agreement and eliminates the toxins of Japanese fascism—we must be vigilant against the resurgence of Japanese aggression and also be vigilant against the agitation of the aggressive forces of other countries colluding with Japan in the Far East. Therefore, the return of the Changchun Railway and the Lushun naval base should be after the conclusion of the peace treaty with Japan, and Dalian, a port designated as a "free port" according to the Yalta Agreement and the 1945 Sino-Soviet Dalian Agreement, will also be handled by both parties after the conclusion of the peace treaty with Japan. If the peace treaty with Japan cannot be concluded within three years due to imperialist obstruction, then within three years China should also be strong enough to control the Changchun Railway and Lushun Port itself. Therefore, the return of the railway and naval base will not be later than the end of 1952 at the latest. This careful and thorough consideration takes into account the interests of our China and is also in line with the position of China and the Soviet Union jointly maintaining peace and defending against aggression. This can only exist between friendly brotherly countries.
    Second, the Treaty of Friendship, Alliance, and Mutual Assistance also emphasizes mutual assistance. Therefore, economic and cultural cooperation beneficial to both countries will be developed and consolidated (Article 5). The loan agreement was concluded based on this principle. 300 million US dollars, with a low interest rate of 1% per annum, will be loaned to us over five years to pay for the purchase of construction equipment from the Soviet Union. This is absolutely beneficial to the people of China and has no disadvantages. We promise to repay the principal and interest with raw materials, tea, cash, US dollars, etc. This is equally beneficial to the Soviet people and has no disadvantages. The Soviet state needs some of our unique or surplus raw materials. The Soviet people also need Chinese tea. As long as we step up production, when we start repaying the principal and interest in 1954, we will be able to pay off the annual principal and interest due with sufficient raw materials and tea. However, in order to express the responsibility of the debtor country, we agree that if there is a shortage, we will pay with cash and US dollars, etc. This shows unparalleled self-esteem and mutual respect on both sides.
    300 million US dollars is borrowed, not a gift. It is for construction, for further production, not for consumption. The equipment exchanged for it will be the best goods manufactured by advanced science and advanced industry. Coupled with the brotherly guidance of Soviet technical experts, we can have absolute confidence in China's accelerated industrialization.
    Following the economic assistance provided by the loan agreement, we believe that a series of other economic and cultural cooperation will come.
    In addition to the loan, we should also recognize that, in the agreement, the Soviet Union's method of transferring property without seeking compensation for the original expenses is a friendly expression of sympathy for our current financial difficulties. The Changchun Railway did not grow out of the ground, but cost a great deal of material resources. The military equipment in Lushun, etc., was not a gift from heaven, but was built. The property that the Soviet Union obtained from the Japanese in the Northeast was also obtained by the Soviet Union with blood and effort. Now, these, except for the expenses required for the equipment added by the Soviet Union in Lushun after 1945, are transferred to China without compensation. What a sharp contrast this is with the attitude of the US imperialists who stubbornly rely on even the address of the barracks!
    Third, the treaty and agreement show everywhere the spirit of treating me as an equal. Before the transfer, in the management of the Changchun Railway, in the military management of Lushun Port, and in the acceptance of Dalian property, Chinese and Soviet personnel are completely equal. This complete equality can only exist between the Soviet socialist country led by Marshal Stalin and the People's Republic of China led by Chairman Mao, and it is a treatment that was impossible for China ruled by reactionary rulers in the past.
    From the above three points, we can say that the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance, and Mutual Assistance and the two agreements signed on the same day are a new symbol of internationalism. A new milestone in Sino-Soviet friendship. Since the October Revolution, the Soviet Union has continuously implemented an internationalist foreign policy and has continuously expressed friendship to the Chinese people and the people of the world. This policy is consistent, and this attitude is unchanged. The Soviet Union has always been like this to any country and people who can be friends. Precisely because of this, this new symbol is a more obvious symbol, and this new milestone is a more indicative milestone, and it is more worthy of welcome and encouragement by the Chinese people, the people of China and the Soviet Union, and the people of the world. Security, peace, and other undertakings beneficial to the Chinese people, beneficial to the people of China and the Soviet Union, and beneficial to the people of the world will have greater development.
    We sincerely thank Marshal Stalin, the leader of the working people of the world. We sincerely thank Chairman Mao Zedong, the leader of the Chinese people.

　　国际主义的新标志、中苏友好的新里程碑
    钱端升
    中苏友好同盟互助条约，关于中长铁路及旅大的协定和关于苏联政府给予中国政府经济贷款的协定已于前日（二月十四日）由两国外长在苏京签订，并于昨日在中苏两国首都同时公布。全中国人民举国欢腾，中苏两国人民携手高呼，人民民主国家的人民一致欢迎，全世界进步人士同声叫好，是必然的反响。
    条约和协定的条文的本身是充满了深厚的友谊的，而这些友好的条文所根据的精神，所涵蓄的意义，和其将必然产生的效果更是无比的伟大而重要。
    由于这一个条约和这两个协定，无疑的，新中国的建设，将加速的顺利的进行，新中国的国际地位有了显著的提高，新中国的革命政权也有了无比的巩固。无疑的，中苏友好合作有了伟大的发展。无疑的，东方和整个世界的和平有了坚强的保障。也无疑的，由马克思和恩格斯所倡导的，由列宁和斯大林所发扬的，并由毛主席在东方无比巨数人民中所身体力行的国际主义有了广大的传布。这些都已经是或即将成为铁的事实，有耳共闻，有目共睹。造谣的帝国主义者将只有连续不断地自打嘴巴，暴露他们谣魔的本色。
    正因为这三个条约及协定所根据的精神是无比的伟大，所涵蓄的意义是无比的深长，所将产生的效果是无比的重要，所以单强调某一件有利事业，无论是新中国建设上的帮助，或是新中国国际地位的提高，或是新中国革命政权的巩固，或是中苏友好的发展，或是世界和平的保障，或是国际主义的推行，是不能也不够给这三个条约及协定以全部的估量。
    单就条约和协定本身的条文而说，下列三点是十分显明，而且也是应当认识的。
    首先，应当指出友好同盟互助条约着重在成立反侵略同盟，以争取安全，争取和平。中苏的共同敌人以前是日本侵略者，今后仍须制止日本或与之勾结者的重新侵略（第一条）。为了这个目的，中苏两国自然要争取于最短期内，共同缔结对日和约（第二条）。引伸同一目的，两国自然要信守同盟，并对有关共同利益的重大国际问题，进行协商（第三第四条）。
    反侵略同盟是绝对有其必要的，于中苏有利，于日本的人民和全世界的人民也有利。不要以为日本是败国战家而不可能再侵略中苏两国，重新加害于中苏人民。相反的，日本法西斯主义者，在美帝国主义者扶持之下，还存在着，而且尚在滋长。美帝国主义者正在以日本为基地，派驻巨数的海陆空军，并许可变相的日本海陆军的重建。中苏两国必须制止一切可能的侵略企图和破坏和平的行动。
    一九四五年的中苏友好同盟条约及其他协定，基本上，是为了同一目的的。那时，日本帝国主义者还未遭到失败。中苏同盟是为了战胜日本。要战胜日本，予敌人关东军以致命的打击，拥有雄厚武装力量的苏联，自应在东北的交通要道——中长铁路——上、在主要海口——旅顺和大连港——中，取得必要的便利。现在，由于中华人民共和国的建立，中国人民力量的抬头，和中苏真诚合作有了可能，“远东形势起了根本的变化”，苏联可不再遭遇到反动政权，如蒋介石匪帮之类的消极的抵制或积极的出卖，中苏双方同意将关于三者的一切权利及财产移交为中国所有。
    但是，我们仍须牢记，我们的主要目的是在共同维护和平，防御侵略。在对日和约——切实符合于波茨坦协定，肃清日本法西斯主义毒素的和约——订立以前，我们须谨防日本侵略势力的再起，同时也谨防勾结日本的其他国家的侵略势力在远东的蠢动。所以中长铁路和旅顺海军根据地的交还应在对日和约缔结之后，而大连这一个根据雅尔塔协定并根据一九四五年中苏大连协定而定为“自由港”的港，双方也同意在缔结对日和约之后处理。万一对日和约因帝国主义的阻挠而不能于三年之内订立，则在三年之内中国也当可强盛到有力量可以自己掌握中长路和旅顺口了。所以铁路和海军根据地的交还至迟将不后于一九五二年年底。这种细密周详的考虑，既照顾到我们中国一国的利益，也合于中苏共同维护和平，防御侵略的立场，这只有在友爱的兄弟国家之间才能有此。
    第二，友好同盟互助条约也着重在互助。因此，于两国均是有利的经济与文化合作将予以发展和巩固（第五条）。贷款协定即根据这一个原则而订立。三万万美元，以年利百分之一的低息，分五年贷予我们，作为偿付向苏联购买建设器材之用。这是于中国的人民有绝对的利，而无一丝的弊。我们承诺以原料、茶、现金、美元等付还本息，这同样对苏联人民有利而无弊。苏联国家需要我们特有的或是有敷余的若干种原料。苏联人民也需要中国茶。我们只消加紧生产，到了一九五四年时，即是开始偿付本息时，我们当能以充足的原料及茶付清按年应还的本息。但是为了表示债务国的责任起见，我们同意，如有不足，则以现金及美元等来付清。这在双方都表现了无比的自尊和互相尊重。
    三万万美元是借来的，不是赠送的。是为了建设，为了进一步的生产，不是为了消费。以之换来的器材将是先进的科学和先进的工业所制造出来的最优秀的货品。再加上苏联技术专家兄弟般的指导，我们对于中国之加速工业化可以绝对的有信心。
    随了贷款协定所给予的经济援助，我们相信，将有一连串的其他方面的经济合作和文化合作要到来。
    贷款之外，我们也该认清，在协定内，苏联所采移交财产不求偿付原支费用的办法是体惜我们目前财政困难的友好的表示。中长铁路不是平地长出来的，是费了极大的物力的。旅顺的军事设备等，也不是天赐的，而是经营而成的。苏联在东北自日本人手中获来的财产也是苏联费了血和力打出来的。而今这些，除了苏联在一九四五年后在旅顺的添置设备所需的费用外，均是无偿付的移交了中国。这是和美帝国主义者连兵营地址还要死赖的态度是怎样的一个尖锐的对比呵！
    第三，条约和协定随处显示了以平等待我的精神。在移交以前，关于中长铁路的管理，关于旅顺口军事的管理，关于大连财产的接收，中苏人员完全平等。这样完全的平等只能存在于斯大林大元帅所领导的苏联社会主义国家和毛主席所领导的中华人民共和国之间的，而为以前反动统治者所统治的中国所不可能有的待遇。
    从以上三点，我们即可以说，中苏友好同盟互助条约及同日签订的两个协定是国际主义的新标志。中苏友好的新里程碑。苏联自十月革命后不断地在执行国际主义的外交政策，也不断地向中国人民和全世界的人民表示友好。这政策是一贯的，这态度是不变的。苏联对任何可以做朋友的国家和人民是一向如此的。正因其如此，这个新的标志更是显明的标志，这个新的里程碑更是指明的里程碑，更是值得中国人民，中苏两国人民，全世界人民欢迎鼓舞。安全，和平及其他有利于中国人民，有利于中苏两国人民，有利于全世界人民的事业必将有更大的发展。
    我们衷心地感谢世界劳动人民领袖斯大林大元帅。我们衷心地感谢中国人民领袖毛泽东主席。
                                  二月十六日
