　　Yanjing University Winter Graduates
　　Government Helps with Employment
　　[From Our Newspaper] Fourteen students who graduated from Yanjing University this winter break have all obtained suitable jobs with the assistance of the People's Government. On February 1st, representatives from the Government Administration Council's Cultural and Educational Committee and the Ministry of Education visited Yanjing University to hold discussions with the winter graduates and exchange opinions on job assignments. The students unanimously expressed their willingness to obey the needs of the people and serve the construction of the new democratic country. Representatives from the Ministry of Education immediately determined the graduates' jobs based on work needs and the students' departments, personal interests, and family circumstances. Specifically: two students from the Economics Department went to the Foreign Investment Enterprise Bureau of the Financial and Economic Committee; one student from the Western Languages ​​Department went to the Ministry of Culture to work as a translator, and another stayed at the school for research; one student from the Education Department from the Northeast was assigned to the Northeast Department of Culture and Education, and two others stayed at the school to serve as directors of the Yanjing University Affiliated Middle School and Primary School. Two students from the Journalism Department went to the News Administration and the Ministry of Health to serve as secretaries; students from the Home Economics, Education, and Sociology Departments were assigned to the All-China Women's Federation and the All-China Federation of Trade Unions to work in nurseries. One student each from the History and Political Science Departments graduated, and they requested to serve as middle school teachers, so they were assigned to the Tianjin Municipal Education Bureau.
　　The Yanjing University authorities and the graduating students are very satisfied with this government measure, believing that the students have all achieved the goal of applying what they have learned. The government provided travel and food expenses to the students who went to work in Tianjin and the Northeast. One student said: "The Ministry of Education is taking such good care of us. Even some parents may not be so good to their children. The concerns about unemployment upon graduation during the reactionary rule are now non-existent."

　　燕大寒假毕业生
    政府帮助就业
    【本报讯】燕京大学本年寒假毕业同学十四人，在人民政府协助下已全部获得适当工作。二月一日，政务院文化教育委员会及教育部曾派代表到燕大与寒假毕业同学座谈，交换分配工作意见。同学们一致表示愿服从人民的需要，为新民主主义国家建设服务。教育部代表当即根据工作需要与同学系别、个人兴趣、家庭环境等条件，确定毕业同学的工作。计：经济系二人至财经委员会外资企业局；西语系一人至文化部担任翻译工作，一人留校研究；教育系一东北籍同学分派至东北文教部，另二人留校任燕大附中、附小主任。新闻系二人，一至新闻总署，一至卫生部担任秘书；家政、教育、社会诸系的同学分派至全国妇联及总工会从事托儿所工作。历史系，政治系各有一人毕业，他们要求担任中学教员，分发至天津市教育局。
    燕大校方和毕业同学对政府这一措施都非常满意，认为同学们都达到了学以致用的目的。去天津、东北工作的同学，政府都发给路费和伙食费。一个同学说：“教育部照顾得太周到了。有的家长对子弟也不一定这样好。反动统治时代毕业即失业的顾虑现在是不存在了。”
