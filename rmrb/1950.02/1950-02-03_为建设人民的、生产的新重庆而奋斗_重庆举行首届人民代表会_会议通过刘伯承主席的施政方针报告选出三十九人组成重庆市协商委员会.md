Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, February 2nd: The first Chongqing Municipal People's Representative Conference was held from January 23rd to 29th. The conference approved the policy guidelines report by Liu Bocheng, Chairman of the Southwest Military and Administrative Committee, on "Striving to Build a New Chongqing That Is of the People and for Production," the report by Mayor Chen Xilian on "The Takeover Work of Chongqing," and the representatives' proposals on building a new Chongqing. It also elected thirty-nine people to form the Chongqing Municipal Consultative Committee.

A total of four hundred representatives from all walks of life attended this conference. First, Liu Bocheng, Chairman of the Southwest Military and Administrative Committee, gave a report, followed by Mayor Chen Xilian, who reported on the work done in the fifty-plus days since Chongqing's liberation in four areas: public security, finance and economy, culture and education, and the handling of former personnel.

Mayor Chen stated: Regarding public security work, under the resolute suppression of the garrison troops and the Municipal Public Security Bureau, the bandit party "Anti-Communist and Protect the People Army" of more than 20,000 people was disbanded and sent home to engage in production, more than 9,000 stray soldiers and vagrants were taken in, and die-hard special agents were arrested, initially establishing the revolutionary order of the city. In the past month or so, 735 public security cases involving robbery, murder, and fraud have been cracked, eliminating the chaotic phenomena of the early days of liberation. However, the work of eliminating special agents and consolidating public security must be strengthened in the future, and all citizens should remain vigilant.

In terms of finance and economy, the first step was to redeem counterfeit currency, enabling the market to recover quickly. The ban on the circulation of silver dollars and the implementation of real value savings have ensured the stability of people's lives. Highway transportation and shipping on the upper and lower reaches of the Yangtze River have been restored successively, and remittances have been opened with 29 cities including Shanghai, Hankou, Zigong, and Wanxian, establishing mutual assistance between the city and major cities and the vast countryside.

The resumption of work in enterprises and the payment of wages are two relatively difficult issues, because the original factories were mostly military industries or industries related to them, and the Kuomintang bandit army had greatly destroyed them when they retreated. However, in the case of a large gap between municipal revenue and expenditure, public factories related to national defense construction and economic construction are still being gradually restored or partially restored as much as possible; private factories that are beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood are given the convenience that can be provided at present.

Regarding cultural and educational work, the policy of maintaining the status quo temporarily and gradually improving it is adopted for all schools. The city's four universities and colleges, sixteen middle schools, and one hundred and seventy-two primary schools have all resumed classes. Recently, it was decided to call on teachers from all schools to organize winter vacation research conferences to strengthen their studies.

Regarding the handling of former personnel, because the original Kuomintang agencies were bloated and huge, a large number of former personnel were taken over. Except for a small number of bad elements with many misdeeds who are still not aware of their mistakes, a responsible attitude is adopted for all of them, and they are either retained for employment or transferred to schools for study. Those who are genuinely willing to return to their hometowns and change careers and are able to make a living are helped to return to their places of origin and change careers.

After listening to the above two reports, the conference held heated discussions and, based on the actual situation, prioritized the order of urgency and importance, and passed proposals such as mobilizing people from all walks of life to support and purchase real value public bonds, assisting production, increasing trade, practicing strict economy, rectifying wharf order, adjusting labor-capital relations, thoroughly eliminating special agents, establishing the Chongqing branch of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, implementing rent reduction, and organizing farmers' associations.

On the 28th, Deng Xiaoping, Political Commissar of the Second Field Army, was invited to attend the meeting and delivered a speech. General Deng used concrete facts to explain the difficulties in building a new Chongqing, the conditions for overcoming difficulties, and the issue that unity is strength, which more clearly pointed out the specific direction of efforts for all the representatives in the future. This conference greatly enhanced the connection between the people and the government. Many representatives expressed that they would spread the resolutions of the conference throughout the city and mobilize the people of the city to assist the government in building a new democratic Chongqing that belongs to the people.

　　为建设人民的、生产的新重庆而奋斗
    重庆举行首届人民代表会
    会议通过刘伯承主席的施政方针报告选出三十九人组成重庆市协商委员会
    【新华社重庆二日电】重庆市第一届各界人民代表会议于上月二十三日至二十九日举行。会议通过了西南军政委员会主席刘伯承关于“为建设人民的、生产的新重庆而奋斗”的施政方针报告，陈锡联市长“关于重庆接管工作”的报告，和代表们有关建设新重庆的各项提案；并选出三十九人组成重庆市协商委员会。本届会议出席各界代表共四百人，首由西南军政委员会主席刘伯承报告，继由陈锡联市长就治安、财政经济、文化教育、处理旧人员等四方面，报告重庆解放五十多天来的工作。陈市长称：关于治安工作，在警备部队和市公安局的坚决镇压下，解散了匪党“反共保民军”二万余人并遣送回家生产，收容散兵游勇九千余名，逮捕了怙恶不悛的特务分子，初步树立了本市的革命秩序。一个多月来，并破获了抢劫、杀害、诈骗等有关治安案件七百三十五件，肃清了解放初期的混乱现象。但今后肃清特务和巩固治安的工作仍须加强，全体市民仍应提高警惕。在财政经济方面，首先收兑伪币，使市场迅速恢复。禁止银元流通和举办折实储蓄，保障了人民生活的安定。先后恢复公路运输以及长江上下游的航运，并与上海、汉口、自贡市、万县等二十九个城市通汇，使本市与各大城市及与广大乡村之间的互助关系建立起来。企业复工和发给工资是比较困难的两个问题，因原有的工厂中以兵工工业或与其有关的工业所占比重较大，且国民党匪军溃退时曾大加破坏。但是在市财政收支差额很大的情况下，对于与国防建设、经济建设有关的公营工厂仍尽可能逐步复工或部分复工；对于有利国计民生的私营工厂则给以当前可能做到的便利。关于文教工作，对各学校采取暂维现状，逐步改进的方针。本市的四所大、专学校，十六所中学，一百七十二所小学都已复课。最近更决定号召各学校教师组织寒假研究会，加强学习。对于旧人员的处理，因原国民党的各种机构都臃肿庞大，接收的旧人员很多，除革退少数劣迹多端而至今尚不觉悟的坏分子外，一律采取负责态度，分别留用或转送学校学习，确系自愿返乡转业，且能谋生者，则帮助其返籍及转业。
    会议于听取以上两报告后，曾展开热烈讨论，并根据实际情况，分别缓急轻重，通过了发动各界人民拥护并竞购折实公债、协助生产、增进贸易、厉行节约、整理码头秩序、调整劳资关系、彻底肃清特务、成立中苏友好协会重庆分会、实行减租、组织农会等提案。二十八日，第二野战军政治委员邓小平应邀莅会讲话。邓将军以具体事实说明建设新重庆的困难所在、克服困难的条件以及团结就是力量三个问题，更明确地给全体代表指出了今后具体的努力方向。这次会议大大增进了人民与政府间的联系，很多代表都表示要将会议的决议传播全市，动员全市人民来协助政府建设人民民主的新重庆。
