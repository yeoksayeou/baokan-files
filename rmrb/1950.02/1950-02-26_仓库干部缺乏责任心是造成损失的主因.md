　　Lack of Responsibility Among Warehouse Cadres is the Main Cause of Losses

　　The inspection revealed that the reasons for grain spoilage in warehouses are as follows: First, last year, due to heavy rainfall, the wheat was damp when it was put into storage. After being stored, it was not promptly turned over and sunned or ventilated. The grain piles inside the warehouses were too thick, preventing heat from dissipating, and with the intrusion of cold air from outside, the grain became moldy. Some warehouses covered the top layer with mats, resulting in the spoilage of the top layer as well. Secondly, there was insect infestation, mostly in the top one, two, or three inches. According to this inspection, Hengshui wheat was not infested with insects because a layer of wheat bran was spread on the wheat. In Baoding Prefecture, some warehouses also prevented wheat from becoming damp or infested with insects by spreading wheat bran. This is a successful experience. Some warehouses used sulfur fumigation, but this must be done before insect infestation occurs. Otherwise, once fumigated, the insects will burrow deeper, expanding the scope of infestation. Thirdly, the warehouse facilities were poor, with no rain shelters over the windows and doors, causing rainwater and snow to seep into the warehouse. Some warehouses were too close to manure pits, pigsties, and toilets, causing damp and foul air to corrode the grain. In short, the reasons for grain spoilage, in addition to objective conditions such as poor facilities, are mainly due to the lack of responsibility among warehouse cadres towards state property. Furthermore, there is serious empiricism in thinking, with superficial inspections that lack depth. This should arouse deep vigilance among responsible personnel at all levels of warehouses.

　　仓库干部缺乏责任心是造成损失的主因
    从这次检查中看出仓库发生坏粮的原因是：第一、去年因雨水大，入库时麦子潮湿，入库后又未及时翻晒、过风。仓房内粮堆的太厚，热气发散不出来，又加外面冷气侵袭，以致霉坏。有的在浮头盖上席子，结果连浮头一层也坏了。其次是虫蚀，这多在浮头一、二、三寸之处。据这次检查，衡水麦子未生虫，原因是在麦子边上盖了一层麦糠。保定专区也有的仓库因铺盖麦糠，而使小麦既未潮湿、也没有被虫蚀。这是一个成功的经验。有的用硫磺薰，但这必须在未生虫前。否则一经烟薰，虫子反深入下层，扩大了虫蚀的范围。第三是仓库设备条件不好，窗口门口无防雨棚，致雨雪浸入仓内，有的太靠近粪坑、猪圈、厕所，致使潮湿浊气腐蚀粮食。总而言之，粮食霉坏的原因除客观条件如设备不良之外，主要原因是由于仓库干部对国家财产缺乏责任心。加之思想上存在严重的经验主义，检查时走马看花，不深入。应引起各级仓库负责人员深切警惕。
