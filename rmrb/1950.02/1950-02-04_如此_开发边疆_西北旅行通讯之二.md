Such "Development of the Frontier"
—Northwest Travelogue II
(By our reporter, Li Wen)

The so-called "development of the frontier" policy implemented by the Kuomintang in the minority ethnic regions of China's frontier was a policy of inciting hatred between ethnic minorities and carrying out cruel exploitation of them. The situation in Labrang is a mirror.

Labrang, being closely connected to the Hui warlord Ma Bufang's rule in Qinghai and located southwest of Linxia County, the hometown of many reactionary elements among the Hui people of Gansu, Ningxia, and Qinghai provinces, became a region where the Kuomintang implemented "using Hui to control Tibetans." Ma Bufang carried out a bloody rule in Labrang. Countless serious bloody struggles occurred between the Hui and Tibetan people here.

Bloody Slaughter and Suppression

In 1940, the Tibetan people of the Tsangshag tribe, unable to endure Ma Bufang's oppression, planned to resist. Ma Bufang discovered this beforehand and sent a bandit army battalion commander with several guards to conspire to assassinate a Living Buddha of the tribe (the tribal leader at the time). The Tibetan people, knowing that the secret had been leaked, simply killed the bandit army battalion commander and others. Ma Bufang then dispatched a large army to bloodbath Tsangshag. The Tibetan people there were vastly outnumbered, and seventy to eighty percent of them were slaughtered, their corpses lying across the roads, blood flowing everywhere. The faster-running Tibetan men and women, along with large numbers of cattle and sheep, were also forced to jump into the Yellow River. The bandit army killed more than seven hundred Tibetan men and women in the Amchok tribe in a single day, burned twenty-eight monasteries belonging to Labrang, and robbed the "Mani" of the Labrang Monastery, even stealing the gilded bottles on the temple roof and valuable gold Buddha statues…

Ethnic Vendettas

In 1943, a Hui-Tibetan feud occurred in Labrang. A young Tibetan man named Dero was conscripted into the army by Ma's bandits. His father, Lugao, learned that he was stationed in Xining, Qinghai, and traveled a long distance to see him. Father and son met and wept bitterly, and planned to escape the tiger's den. The two of them fled to Linxia, Gansu, but were recaptured by Ma's bandits. The bandits, like tethering an ox, pierced old Tibetan Lugao's nose with an iron rope and led him all the way from Linxia to Xining. Lugao died painfully as a result. Dero vowed to avenge his father. He learned that the Ma bandit army company that killed his father was stationed in Daxia Mountain, southwest of Linxia, and invited several close friends to raid the camp overnight, killing more than seventy soldiers of Ma's bandit army. Finally, Dero was arrested in Labrang. Ma's bandit army used all kinds of tortures on Dero, and even cut off his head and displayed it in Linxia for several days as a warning.

Cruel Exploitation

The Kuomintang's exploitation in Labrang was the fundamental reason for the increasing poverty of the Tibetan people. First of all, the taxes were as numerous as the hairs on an ox. For example, the land tax alone had items such as land grain, public grain, military grain, surcharges, borrowed grain, special self-defense donations, and temporary loans. Livestock tax included surcharged horses, pre-levied horses, and urgently levied horses (one and a half horses were equivalent to one conscripted man). In addition, there were donations for supporting the army, banquet donations, house donations, mill donations, and taxes on mules and horses used for transportation. During the Kuomintang rule, when someone died in a Tibetan family, 30 percent of the family property had to be handed over as inheritance tax. The exploitation did not stop there. In 1944, bandit chief Chiang Kai-shek, under the pretext of celebrating his "birthday," squandered more than one million silver dollars in one go!

"Model Kuomintang Members"

Many scandals about Kuomintang "frontier" workers are circulating in Labrang.

There was a man known as a "frontier expert," who once served as the secretary-general of the Kuomintang district party headquarters in Labrang, named Sheng Jingxin. It is said that he received the "Jin Xing Medal" from the bandit party central committee and was called a "model party member" for his "meritorious service in developing the frontier." In the two months after taking office, he once "developed" hundreds and thousands of "party members." He told the Tibetan people, "A party card can be used as a pass," and without a "pass," it would be inconvenient to travel. Sheng Jingxin's henchmen went to the countryside and, upon finding out which family was wealthy, would accuse them of being "bandits" or "Communists." He also served as the principal of the Golok Tibetan People's School, and therefore received a large amount of funding from the puppet National Government's Ministry of Education, but in the end, he took it all for business. He also compiled and printed a "News Brief," one issue per day, printing a total of five or six copies, one copy each to the Kuomintang puppet central party headquarters, organization department, Gansu provincial party headquarters, and the puppet National Government's Ministry of Education, with the remaining copy kept as a stub. This was their "frontier cultural undertaking!"

　　如此“开发边疆”
    ——西北旅行通讯之二
    （本报记者力文）
    国民党在中国边疆上少数民族地区所实行的所谓“开发边疆”的政策，是挑拨少数民族间的仇恨，并对少数民族实行残酷剥削的政策。拉卜楞的情况，就是一面镜子。
    拉卜楞因为密接回族军阀马步芳统治的青海，同时又是处在甘、宁、青三省回族中许多反动分子的家乡——临夏县的西南面，于是这里就成为国民党“以回制藏”的地区，马步芳在拉卜楞实行过血腥的统治。这里的回藏两族发生过无数次的严重的血的斗争。
    血腥的屠杀与镇压
    一九四○年藏仓部落的藏民，不堪马匪步芳的压榨，计议反抗，马匪事前发觉，即派匪军营长率卫士数人，阴谋诱杀该部落的某活佛（当时的部落领袖），藏民们知大事已泄，索性把匪军营长等人杀掉了，马步芳遂派遣大军血洗藏仓。该地藏民因众寡悬殊，十分之七八被屠杀了，尸横道旁，血流遍野，跑得快的藏民男女与大批的牛羊，也被逼得跳了黄河。马匪军在阿木去乎部落一天杀过七百多藏民男女，焚烧过拉卜楞所属的二十八个寺院，抢走过拉卜楞大寺的“摩尼”，连庙宇顶上的镀金瓶、贵重的金佛像也抢走了……
    民族仇杀
    在一九四三年，拉卜楞发生过一个回藏仇杀的故事。一个名叫得罗的青年藏民被马匪抓壮丁走了，他的父亲鲁高探听到他在青海西宁一带驻防，便远道赶去看望他，父子见面痛哭一场，并计议逃出虎口，父子二人潜逃至甘肃临夏，后又被马匪抓回，匪徒们，像拴牛一样，用铁绳钻透老藏民鲁高的鼻子，一直从临夏牵到西宁，鲁高因此痛苦地死去。得罗立志为父报仇，他探听到杀害父亲的马匪某营，驻扎在临夏西南的大峡山，遂邀约几个知心好友，连夜偷袭营寨，连杀马匪军七十多人。最后，得罗在拉卜楞被逮捕了。马匪军对得罗用尽各种毒刑，还割掉他的头颅，在临夏城悬首数天示众。
    残酷的剥削
    国民党在拉卜楞的剥削，是藏民日益贫困的根本原因。首先是捐税多如牛毛，例如田赋一项就有所谓田粮、公粮、军粮、附征、附借粮、自卫特捐、临时借款等名目，马匹一项有附征马匹、预征丁马、急征丁马（一匹半马折顶一个壮丁），另外还有劳军捐款、宴席捐、房捐、磨捐、跑运输的骡马还要出税，国民党统治时期，藏民家中死了人，要交出家产百分之三十作遗产税。剥削并不止于此，一九四四年，匪首蒋介石以庆祝“寿辰”名义曾一次括去了银元百余万元！
    “模范国民党员”
    拉卜楞流传着许多关于国民党“边疆”工作人员的丑事。
    有一个号称“边疆通”，曾任拉卜楞国民党区党部书记长的绳景信，据说，因“开发边疆有功”，曾得过匪党中央的“锦星勋章”，并被称为“模范党员”。他在到任的两个月间，一度“发展”了成百成千的“党员”，他向藏民们说：“党证可当通行证”，没有“通行证”走路来往就不方便。绳景信的爪牙下乡，打听到那家有钱，便扣上个“土匪”或“共党”的帽子。他又兼了果洛部落藏民学校的校长，因而向伪国民政府教育部领了大批经费，结果全部拿去做了生意。他并且编印一种“新闻简报”，每天一期，共印五、六份，分寄国民党伪中央党部、组织部、甘肃省党部和伪国府教育部各一份，其余一份留为存根，这就是他们的“边疆文化事业！”
