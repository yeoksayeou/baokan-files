　　Beijing Grain, Cloth, Department Stores, and Other Businesses to Open Today; Stock Exchange Reopened Yesterday
　　[Beijing News] The grain, cotton yarn, and cloth markets, as well as rice and flour shops, grain stores, department stores, and other businesses in Beijing will officially reopen today (February 22nd). During the Spring Festival holiday, some unscrupulous merchants took the opportunity of the market closure to raise prices, affecting people's lives. The Beijing Grain Company specially advanced the retail sale of grain at the Xian Nong Tan market yesterday morning (February 21st), selling more than 150,000 jin of coarse grains and more than 180 bags of flour. Most of the buyers were farmers and small vendors. The listed prices remained the same as before the holiday: 8-1 flour was 68,000 yuan per bag, Northeast corn was 700 yuan, and Northeast sorghum was 630 yuan.
　　[Beijing News] The Beijing Stock Exchange reopened as usual yesterday (February 21st). After the Spring Festival, sentiment was upward. "Qi Xin" opened at 260,800 yuan, with the high price settling at 265,000 yuan. Later, because Tianjin's opening was reported to be 245,000 yuan, the market softened immediately, hovering around 240,000 yuan. It finally closed at a low price of 236,000 yuan. However, sentiment was excited, and the total transaction volume was about twice as high as before the Spring Festival. The trading of other stocks was still not very active.

　　京粮布百货等业今起开市营业
    证券交易所昨日开市
    【北京讯】京市粮食、花纱布等市场及米面粮、粮栈、百货等业，今（二十二日）天都正式开市。春节中部分奸商曾趁休市期间，哄抬物价，影响人民生活。北京市粮食分公司特提前于昨（二十一）日上午在先农坛市场零售粮食，共售出粗粮十五万多斤，面粉一百八十多袋，购买的人大部分是农民和小商贩，牌价仍照休市前的价格：八一面粉每袋六万八千元，东北玉米七百元，东北高粱六百三十元。
    【北京讯】北京证券交易昨（二十一）起照常开市。春节过后人情向上，“启新”前市开盘二十六万零八百元，大价妥到二十六万五千元，后因天津开盘传为二十四万五千元，行情随即软下，在二十四万元左右盘旋，最后以二十三万六千元小价收盘。惟人情兴奋，交易总额比春节前约增一倍，其他股票交易情况仍不甚活跃。
