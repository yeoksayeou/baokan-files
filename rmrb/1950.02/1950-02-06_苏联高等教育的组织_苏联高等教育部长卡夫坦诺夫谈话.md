The Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks) and the Soviet government have always paid special attention to the issue of cultivating Soviet intellectual cadres.

Now in the Soviet Union, there is not a single national republic without its own higher education institutions.

Soviet higher education institutions dispatch an army of specialists to the national economy every year, numbering over 100,000. For example, in 1948, a total of 125,000 experts graduated from higher education institutions, and the number of graduates this year, 1949, will far exceed last year. These numbers are so huge that we only need to look at the pre-revolutionary period to judge: before the revolution, the number of students graduating from higher education institutions was less than 10,000, and the total number of students averaged 112,000. Now in the Soviet Union, there are 750,000 university students studying in 800 well-equipped higher education institutions.

Now, during the Five-Year Plan successfully implemented by the Soviet people, Soviet enterprises, collective farms, and cultural and educational institutions will obtain 600,000 young experts from higher education institutions for all sectors of the national economy. This achievement is undoubtedly great.

The achievements of higher education institutions are largely due to the organizational structure of Soviet higher education institutions, their leadership system, and the methods and organization of the teaching process.

Let me elaborate on these issues.

First, let's talk about the structure of Soviet specialized schools. In the Soviet Union, all higher education institutions are state-owned, and there are no private higher education institutions in our country.

How is the leadership and management of these higher education institutions organized? During the Soviet regime, the leadership system of higher education institutions has changed several times.

In the early years of the Soviet regime, all schools, including higher education institutions, were under the jurisdiction of the People's Commissariat of Education of the respective member republics.

During the period of socialist transformation of the national economy, the entire higher education system was rebuilt. Higher education institutions have grown significantly. Engineering, agricultural, medical, legal, and other higher education institutions were reorganized and managed by the corresponding People's Economic Commissariats. Only universities, education colleges, and normal colleges remained under the management of the People's Commissariat of Education of each republic.

The direct subordination of higher education institutions to the Economic People's Commissariat promoted the improvement of cadre training leadership and the establishment of a direct link between coursework and the actual tasks of various sectors of the national economy.

In all People's Commissariats and government agencies that manage higher education institutions, school management offices are organized to be responsible for leading expert training and inspecting higher education institutions.

The government's decision in 1936 to establish a Committee on Higher Education Affairs under the Council of People's Commissars of the Soviet Union was a major step forward in the organization of the management of Soviet higher education institutions. The committee was given great powers. Its business extended to all fixed-location and correspondence higher education institutions, regardless of which agency they were under.

The Committee on Higher Education Affairs has done a tremendous job during its ten years of existence. It solved the complex and important responsibility of restoring schools that were destroyed and looted by the German fascist aggressors.

However, in the post-war years, our country has new tasks that require further reorganization of the leadership of higher education institutions.

In April 1946, the Ministry of Higher Education of the Soviet Union was established, and more than 300 large institutions of higher learning across the country were transferred from the management of various ministries and government agencies to the Ministry of Higher Education. All universities, all engineering, agricultural, law, economics, and other schools are subordinate to it. Some higher education institutions are still managed by several ministries and government agencies. These schools include transportation, medicine, and education higher education institutions, sports academies, and schools for creating art workers. However, the scientific and methodological leadership of all higher education institutions, regardless of their administrative affiliation, is the responsibility of the Ministry of Higher Education. Such a centralized leadership of the higher education institution network is able to take into account the prospects for further development of all sectors of the national economy and prepare new expert cadres in accordance with the needs of all republics, border regions, and states in terms of geography. The main types of higher education institutions in the Soviet Union are universities or specialized schools. Senior military schools are generally called research institutes. Some ordinary research institutes are also named in this way, such as: Tbilisi Art Research Institute, Moscow Timiryazev Agricultural Research Institute, Leningrad Forest Industry Research Institute, etc. Among these naming conventions, the historically determined continuity of various types of higher education institutions is preserved. For example, in the 19th century, specialized higher education institutions, especially engineering, commercial, agricultural, forestry, and other higher education institutions, began to be called colleges. Since then, this naming convention for specialized higher education institutions has been preserved to this day.

A few words about the structure of higher education institutions themselves.

Every Soviet higher education institution is an independent educational institution. Its funding is composed of appropriations from the state budget and special funds from the income from scientific research and other work completed by specialized schools. The property of higher education institutions—buildings, equipment, inventory, etc.—is state property.

The head of a higher education institution is the president. He is fully responsible for organizing the teaching program, cultivating highly skilled young experts and their ideological education, and conducting scientific research work.

Under the chairmanship of the president, an academic conference of the higher education institution is established, whose composition includes vice presidents, deans, heads of departments, and representatives of various associations of the higher education institution. If the school prepares experts for certain enterprises and agencies, representatives of those enterprises and agencies may also be included.

The responsibilities of the academic conference include: reviewing the semester and academic year plans and the work reports of the higher education institution, the departments, and the departments, discussing teaching methodology issues and the thematic plans of scientific research work, discussing and proposing candidates for the academic titles of associate professor and professor, and awarding bachelor's and doctoral degrees (the academic conference's decisions on awarding academic titles of associate professor and professor and bachelor's and doctoral degrees must be approved by the Higher Certification Committee of the Ministry of Higher Education of the Soviet Union).

Each higher education institution usually has several departments, which are teaching and administrative departments. They unite various departments to realize the training of university students in several kinds of similar specialized knowledge. The department is headed by a dean, who directly leads the teaching and scientific research work of the department, as well as the production internships of university students. The dean is also responsible for supervising the implementation of teaching plans and teaching outlines, calculating student grades, and observing discipline.

In higher education institutions, the teaching process is organized by the department. It directly implements the teaching methods and scientific research work of a subject or several closely related subjects. The department discusses all teaching methodology issues and listens to scientific reports at its own meetings.

The chairman of the department and the professors lead the department. He teaches the main courses and guides the work of professors, lecturers, graduate students, and students.

The position of chairman of the department and the positions of professor and associate professor are all filled by means of competition. This is done in order to correctly select and equip scientific research forces. The competition is usually held in the middle of the spring semester, and the announcement is published in the central newspapers.

People with the academic title of professor or a doctorate degree can participate in the academic competition for the position of chairman of the department; and those participating in the competition for the position of associate professor are those with the academic title of associate professor or a bachelor's degree. In individual cases, it is also allowed to break this rule: highly skilled experts with rich practical production experience can also participate in the competition.

The election of candidates to fill vacant positions is decided by the academic conference of the higher education institution by means of secret ballot.

The senior lecturer of the department is appointed from among the most skilled teaching assistants, and in individual cases, in addition to guiding the practical coursework, they are also assigned to teach unimportant courses. The position of senior lecturer is usually a transitional stage to reach the title of associate professor, if the senior lecturer will defend the thesis for a bachelor's degree.

The principle of competitive selection exists not only in the replacement of professor and lecturer cadres, but also in the recruitment of first-year students.

The Soviet Constitution guarantees that all citizens between the ages of seventeen and thirty-five have the right to apply to higher education institutions, regardless of their gender, nationality, ethnicity, or religious belief. The only criterion for choosing to enter higher education institutions is knowledge.

Young men and women who graduate from middle school with excellent grades and exemplary conduct and receive a gold or silver medal can be exempted from the entrance examination. However, if medal recipients apply to higher architectural schools, they must also take painting and drawing exams, and those applying to art, music, drama, and sports higher education institutions must take exams in those specialized knowledge.

In addition to medal recipients, all other applicants for higher education institutions must undergo entrance examinations. The common examination subjects for all higher education institutions are: Russian, literature, the language used for teaching in the higher education institution, and a foreign language. In some higher education institutions, there is no foreign language examination in the entrance examination.

In addition to the subjects listed above, there are also examinations related to the specialized knowledge of the higher education institution. For example, those applying to higher engineering schools must undergo tests of knowledge of mathematics, physics, and chemistry, and those applying to higher law schools must undergo examinations in history and geography, etc.

The entrance examination is held according to a unified outline. This outline is approved by the Ministry of Higher Education of the Soviet Union and is formulated to suit the amount and content of education obtained in middle school.

The examinations in Russian and the language used for teaching in the higher education institution, as well as mathematics, are written tests, while all other subjects are only oral tests. During the examination process, those who receive a poor rating in one subject are not allowed to take the following examinations. Among the students who pass the test, those with the highest examination ratings are first admitted as university students in higher education institutions.

The entrance examination is usually held from August 1st to August 20th.

The recruitment of new students is led by a committee, which is chaired by the president, and its members are the vice president, the dean, and individual professors.

Participants in the Patriotic War have special conditions for applying to higher education institutions. They enjoy preferential treatment. For example, war participants who pass the entrance examination can be accepted into the school without a competition of examiners.

Generally speaking, this is the structure of Soviet higher education institutions, their management system, the rules for selecting professors and lecturers, and the rules for supplementing higher education students.

Now I will briefly talk about the organization of the teaching program.

The foundation of all activities in higher education institutions lies in the course system of study and the principle of mandatory participation in lectures, seminars, laboratory work, etc.

The study period in Soviet higher education institutions is four to five and a half years. In individual cases, it is extended to six years.

An academic year is divided into two semesters: the autumn semester, from September 1st to January 23rd; the spring semester, from February 7th to June 30th.

The order in which the subjects being studied are conducted, their interconnections, and mutual relationships are stipulated by the teaching plan. The plan consists of several groups: socio-economic group, general science group, and specialized group. In higher engineering schools, a general engineering group may also be separated, which occupies an extremely important position in the training of engineers.

Without exception, the teaching plans of all higher education institutions allocate a large number of hours to the study of basic knowledge of Marxism-Leninism.

Soviet higher education institutions pay great attention to the study of basic knowledge of Marxism-Leninism, which is done in accordance with Stalin's historically significant instructions: "There is no need for a medical expert to be a physics expert or a botany expert at the same time; the same is true in reverse. But there is a branch of science, the knowledge of which is essential for Bolsheviks in all branches of science, and that is Marxism-Leninism, the science of society, the laws of social development, the laws of development of proletarian revolution, the laws of development of socialist construction, and the victory of communism." Furthermore: "A Leninist must not only be an expert in the science he loves, he must also be a politician and a social activist, actively concerned about the fate of his country, understand the laws of social development, be good at applying these laws, and strive to become an active participant in the political leadership of the country." (See "Problems of Leninism") Stalin's extremely important instructions have been successfully transformed into practical life in Soviet higher education institutions.

Production internships also occupy an important position in the teaching plan, about which I will talk about in more detail later.

When organizing all forms of the teaching program, the basic attention is placed on students' self-study. The standard for student grades is the rating of the examination of lecture courses and the test of practical work.

There are two examination periods a year, that is, after each semester. Promotion to the next grade is once a year.

Soviet higher education institutions utilize all the teaching methods available to them and seek to achieve a combination of them.

When selecting and applying teaching methods, the basic principle is to strive to ensure the fullest development of students' creativity and independence in various ways.

In Soviet higher education institutions, there are the following ways of teaching work: lectures by professors and associate professors, practical work in laboratories, research rooms, factories, affiliated hospitals, etc., planning of class and graduation theses, production internships, and finally, students' self-study.

Lectures are allocated 40 to 50 percent of the study time, depending on the type, tasks, and nature of the subject of the higher education institution. Laboratory and practical work accounts for 50 to 60 percent of the study time.

Lectures, like other teaching methods, are adopted by all higher education institutions in the Soviet Union. Lectures stipulate the basic content of the science, introduce the principles of science and the principles of research methods to students, and guide students' further work and self-study in all forms.

In some cases, lectures are not accompanied by any supplementary work, and in other cases, either homework assignments or seminars and laboratory work are assigned after the lectures.

Homework assignments are adopted when studying these subjects, namely: physics, mathematics, theoretical mechanics, mechanics and machine theory, strength of materials, and so on.

At the same time as homework assignments, seminar work is also implemented (especially in humanities and theoretical subjects). In these assignments, higher education students must attend and make reports with the nature of preliminary scientific research work. This will undoubtedly expand the scientific horizons of seminar participants and make them aware of the most important methods of scientific research.

Soviet higher education institutions pay special attention to laboratory work, affiliated hospital work, etc. Laboratory work can deepen theoretical courses, enable students to master the necessary experimental experience, and enable them to practically understand specialized equipment. In the laboratory work, students obtain an individual work position, and under common supervision and the guidance of lecturers, he completes the academic tasks at this work position.

In higher engineering schools, the study of some subjects must also be accompanied by calculation and drawing work or annual thesis plans. Students must submit the annual thesis plan to the chairman of the department.

In higher education institutions of the humanities, students must complete class assignments on major subjects, usually one per semester, or even one for the entire academic year.

The annual assignment and the annual thesis plan both pursue one purpose—to make students accustomed to working independently and accustomed to widely using reference books and original materials.

Above I mentioned production internships.

Production internships are organized in excellent enterprises and agencies in all sectors of the national economy: in factories, manufacturing plants, in mines, schools, in excellent rural hospitals or district hospitals, university-affiliated hospitals, pharmaceutical rooms, in construction projects, in collective farms and state-owned farms.

Enterprises and agencies are often approved for higher education institutions as student internship bases for a period of four to six years or more.

During the initial grade internship period, students will understand production; in the higher grade internships, they will work directly as technicians, shift engineers, etc.

In the cultivation of highly skilled experts, the so-called pre-graduation internship is of particular significance, which is the final production internship for graduates. If university students understand the basic knowledge of the engineering process of one of the production divisions (workshops, departments, work shifts) during the production internship and work with the nature of assistants to the corresponding types of workers, then during the pre-graduation internship period, these university graduates will study broader production departments and perform the tasks of responsible workers—an assistant to a department leader, a shift engineer, a technologist, an agronomist, an animal husbandry specialist, a mechanic, and so on. Pre-graduation internships provide university students with the skilled experience of organizing work, managing production institutions, and enable young experts to understand the engineering process of enterprises. When university students perform this or that production task, they simultaneously select the necessary materials for the graduation thesis, so that their plans are more closely linked with the needs of the socialist national economy. It is often heard that university students have helped solve very important production tasks with their rationalization proposals during their pre-graduation internships.

Generally speaking, the duration of production internships in higher education institutions is ten to thirty-six weeks. For example, students of higher construction engineering schools must intern for thirty-six weeks, while students of higher medical schools and higher education schools intern for ten to fifteen weeks.

The general guidance of students' production internships is realized by the corresponding departments of higher education institutions, and the most skilled professors and lecturers are appointed as direct instructors. Workers in the national economy also actively participate in guiding students' production internships. Each enterprise or agency assigns an expert to engage in the general guidance of student work. If necessary, this expert can be exempted from performing his direct tasks.

After all the requirements of the academic program have been completed, university students will make a graduation thesis plan. The themes of degree thesis plans are very broad and diverse in higher engineering schools. Students usually get topics to design a certain complex object: such as locomotives, automobiles, airplanes, factories, workshops, power stations, and so on.

In universities and other higher education institutions of the humanities, no graduation thesis plan is made, but state examinations are stipulated, testing three to five major subjects.

After reading the higher education institution, making the graduation thesis plan, or passing the state examination, the graduation certificate of graduation from the higher education institution is obtained.

The most outstanding students are awarded a graduation certificate with honors. A graduation certificate with honors provides graduates of higher education institutions with the right to work as graduate students or to be enrolled in various scientific expeditions.

The structure and academic program organization order of Soviet higher education institutions described above ensure the cultivation of highly skilled experts in various sectors of the Soviet national economy and culture.

Above, I have to a considerable extent described the achievements of our Soviet higher education institution network in training young experts. In order to realize the large-scale Stalin Five-Year Plan, in order to build communism in our country, we need a large army of Soviet intellectuals, which is completely new and fundamentally different from the old, pre-revolutionary intellectuals. We already have such an army. Stalin said that in the Soviet Union "a large number of new intellectuals have been born and formed, all of whom are from the working class, peasants, and Soviet employees, are flesh and blood with our people, do not know what the shackles of the exploitation system are, hate the exploiters, and are determined to serve the people of all ethnic groups in the Soviet Union with loyalty" (Stalin, "Problems of Leninism").

　　苏联高等教育的组织
    ——苏联高等教育部长卡夫坦诺夫谈话
    王繁译
    苏联共产党（布尔什维克）和苏联政府对于培养苏维埃知识分子干部的问题经常寄予特别大的关注。
    现在在苏联，没有一个民族共和国没有自己的高级学校。
    苏联的高级学校每年为国民经济而派遣出专家的大军，为数在十万人以上。例如，一九四八年从高级学校毕业的共有十二万五千专家，而在今年一九四九年毕业学生的数目还要远远超过去年。这些数目字是多么巨大，我们只看一看革命以前便足以判断了：革命前从高级学校毕业的学生数目不上一万人，学生的总数平均有十一万二千人。现在在苏联有七十五万大学生在八百个设备优良的高级学校里学习。
    现在在苏维埃人民所顺利实现的五年计划期间，苏联各企业、集体农庄以及文化教育机关将从高级学校获得国民经济所有部门的六十万青年专家。这个成就毫无疑义是很大的。
    高级学校底有成就的工作，在颇大的程度上是由苏联高级学校的组织结构、它们的领导系统、教学过程的方法和组织而促成的。
    让我对这些问题加以详述。
    首先说一说苏联专门学校的结构。在苏联所有的高级学校都是国立的，私立高级学校在我们国家是没有的。
    这些高级学校的领导和管理是如何来组织呢？在苏维埃政权年代内高级学校的领导系统曾有好几次的改变。
    在苏维埃政权的初年，所有的学校，包括高级学校在内，都隶属于各盟员共和国的教育人民委员部。
    在国民经济的社会主义改造时期，全部高级学校制度改建了。高级学校已大大成长起来。工学的、农业的、医学的、法学的及其他诸高级学校都被改由相应的各人民经济委员部管理。在各共和国教育人民委员部管理下的只剩下大学、教育学院和师范学院。
    高级学校之直接隶属于经济人民委员部，促进了干部培养领导的改善，及建立课业同国民经济各部门的实际任务之间的直接连系。
    在所有的人民委员部及政府机关里，若其管理下有高级学校，则都组织学校管理处，负责专家培养的领导及高级学校的视察。
    一九三六年政府关于在苏联人民委员会之下成立高级学校事宜委员会的决定，在管理苏联高级学校工作的组织中是大大向前的一步。该委员会被赋以很大的职权。他的业务扩展到所有的有固定处所的以及函授的高级学校，不管它们受什么机关管辖。
    高级学校事宜委员会在其存在的十年内作成了巨大的工作。恢复被德国法西斯蒂侵略者破坏了并劫掠了的学校这样一个繁杂复杂责任重大的问题由它解决了。
    但是，在战后年间我们国家又出现了新的任务，它们要求高级学校领导的更进一步的改组。
    一九四六年四月里，成立了苏联高等教育部，国内三百多个庞大的高等学校，由各部、各政府机关的管理下转移到高等教育部了。所有的大学，所有的工学、农业、法学、经济及其他等学校都隶属于它。有部分的高级学校还照旧归若干部和政府机关管理。这样的学校计有运输、医学、教育诸高级学校，体育学院，及造就艺术工作者的学校。但是所有高级学校的科学上的方法上的领导，却与它们的管辖隶属无关，而统由高等教育部负责。高等学校网的这样集中的领导，便能够照顾到国民经济所有部门进一步发展的远景，并适应按地域来说所有各共和国、各边区、各州对干部的需要而准备新的专家干部。苏联高等学校的主要类型为大学或专门学校。高级军事学校一般常名为研究院。若干普通的研究院也这样命名，如：第比里斯艺术研究院，莫斯科季米良结夫农业研究院，列宁格勒森林工业研究院等等。在这些命名之中，保留着高级学校各类型的历史上确定的相续性。例如，在十九世纪，专门的高级学校，特别是工学的、商业的、农业的、林业的及其他各高级学校开始称作学院。从那个时候起，专门高级学校的这一命名便保存至今。
    关于高级学校本身的结构说几句话。
    每一个苏联高级学校都是独立的教育机关。它的经费是由国家预算拨款以及由专门学校以完成的科学研究及其他工作的收入所得的专款而构成的。高级学校的财产——建筑、设备、资产目录等等——都是国家的财产。
    高级学校的首脑为校长。他对于组织教学程序、对于培养高级熟练的青年专家及他们的思想教育、对于进行科学研究工作，均负全责。
    在校长主席之下，设立高级学校学术会议，它的成分为副校长、系主任、讲座主任以及高级学校各社团的代表。若该学校为某些企业和机关准备专家，则那些企业和机关的代表亦可能被包括进去。
    学术会议的责任包括：审查学期学年计划和该高级学校、各系、各讲座的工作报告，讨论教学方法上的问题及科学研究工作的主题计划，讨论并提出副教授和教授学术称衔的候选人，授予科学学士和博士的学位（学术会议关于授予副教授、教授的学术称衔及科学学士、博士的学位的决定，要由苏联高等教育部高级证明委员会所批准）。
    每个高级学校通常均有若干系，它们是教学行政的部门。它们联合各讲座，实现对大学生若干种相近的专门知识的训练。系以系主任为首，他直接领导该系的教学工作和科学研究工作，以及大学生们的生产实习。系主任还负责监督教学计划和教学纲领的实施，学生成绩之计算及纪律之遵守。
    在高级学校里，教学过程由讲座组织。它直接实现一门学科或数门密切关联的学科的教学方法的及科学研究的工作。讲座在自己的会议上讨论所有的教学方法问题并听取科学报告。
    讲座主任、教授领导讲座。他讲授主要的课程，并指导教授、讲师、研究生及学生们的工作。
    讲座主任一职以及教授、副教授的职务都是以竞赛的方式递补的。这样作是为了正确地挑选和配备科学研究的力量。竞赛通常在春季学期中间进行，其通告公布于中央报纸上。
    有教授学术称衔的或有科学博士学位的人，可以参加讲座主任职务的学业竞赛；而参加副教授职务竞赛的则是有副教授学术称衔或科学学士学位的人。在个别情形下也容许破除这个规则：具有丰富的实际生产经验的高度熟练专家亦可以参加竞赛。
    选举候选者递补空缺职务，由高级学校的学术会议以秘密投票的方式决定之。
    讲座的高级讲师乃由最为熟练的助教中任命，他们在个别情形下，除了指导实习的课业外，还受任讲授不重要的课程。高级讲师的职务通常是达到副教授称衔的过渡阶段，如果高级讲师将辩论科学学士学位论文的话。
    竞赛挑选的原则不仅是存在于教授讲师干部的补缺，而且也存在于招收一年级新生上。
    苏联宪法保证所有年龄在十七岁至三十五岁之间的公民都有权投考高级学校，不论其性别、民族、人种、宗教信仰。选择入高级学校的唯一标准是知识。
    男女青年，中学毕业时因卓越的成绩和模范的品行而获得金奖章或银奖章者，可以免去入学考试。然而，假使奖章获得者投考高级建筑学校时，他们还要考绘画与作图，投考艺术的、音乐的、戏剧的和体育的高级学校者，则要考试那些专门知识。
    除了奖章获得者以外，其余所有的高级学校投考者都要经受入学考试。所有高级学校共同的考试科目有：俄文，文学，在该高等学校讲授所用的语文，和一种外国语文，在若干个高级学校里入学考试没有外国语文的考试。
    除了上面列举过的科目以外，还有关系于高级学校的专门学识的考试。例如，投考高级工科学校的要经受数学、物理、化学知识的测验，投考高级法科学校的要经受历史、地理的考试等等。
    入学考试按照统一的纲领举行。这个纲领乃由苏联高等教育部所批准，并且是适合于中学所得到的教育的分量及内容而拟订的。
    俄文和在该高级学校讲授所用语文以及数学的考试，是笔试，而其他一切科目，都只用口试。每一科目分别考试的结果以下列评分符号评定：“优等”，“好”，“中等”，“劣”。在考试进行中，那些有一门得到劣等评定的人，以下的考试便不容许了。通过考验的学生中那些有着最高考试评定者，首先被录取为高级学校的大学生。
    入学考试通常在八月一号到二十号举行。
    招收新生由一个委员会领导，它由校长作主席，其委员为副校长、系主任和个别的教授。
    卫国战争的参加者们投考高级学校，有着特殊的条件。他们享有优待。例如：通过入学考试的战争参加者们，便可不经考试者的竞赛而被接受入校。
    一般讲，苏联高级学校的结构，它们的管理制度，挑选教授讲师的规则，以及高级学校学生补充的规则，便是如此。
    现在我来简单地谈一谈教学程序的组织问题。
    高等学校所有活动的基础在于学习的课程系统及必须参加听讲、研究班、实验室作业等的原则。
    苏联高级学校学习期限为四年到五年半。个别情形下它延长到六年。
    一个学年分作两个学期：秋季学期，从九月一日到一月二十三日；春季学期，从二月七日到六月三十日。
    被研究的各门学科的进行顺序，其间接续及相互关系，由教学计划规定。计划由若干组构成：社会经济组，一般科学组及专门组。在高等工科学校里可能还分出一般工程组，这在造就工程师中，占极为重要的地位。
    无例外地，所有高级学校的教学计划都对马列主义科学基本知识的研究分配大量的钟点。
    苏联高等学校对马列主义科学基本知识的研究都极为注意，这是遵照斯大林的具有历史意义的指示而作的：“没有什么必要使得一位医学专家，同时又是一个物理学专家或植物学专家；反过来说也是一样。但有一个科学部门的知识，却是所有一切科学部门中的布尔什维克所必须具备的，这就是马列主义关于社会、社会发展规律、无产阶级革命发展规律、社会主义建设事业发展规律以及共产主义胜利的科学。”再往下：“列宁主义者决不能仅仅是他自己所喜爱的那门科学的专家，他同时还应当是政治家和社会活动家，积极关怀本国命运，通晓社会发展规律，善于运用这些规律，并力求成为积极参加国家政治领导工作的人。”（俱见《列宁主义问题》）斯大林此一极为重要的指示，在苏联各高级学校里已有成果地变为实际生活。
    教学计划中生产实习也占有重大地位，关于它我往后再详细地讲。
    组织教学程序的一切形式时，基本的注意是放在学生的自修上的。学生成绩的标准是讲义课程考试和实习作业测验的评分。
    考试期一年有两次，即在每个学期过后。升级一年有一次。
    苏联高级学校利用一切它可用的教授方法，并求达到它们之间的结合。
    在选择和应用教授方法时，基本原则是力求以各种方法保证学生创造力和自立性的最充分发展。
    在苏维埃高级学校中存在着下面几种教学工作的方式：教授和副教授的讲授，实验室、研究室、工厂、附属医院等的实习作业，学级及毕业论文的计划，生产实习，最后，是学生的自修。
    讲授分配有百分之四十到五十的学业时间，视其高级学校类型、任务及学科的性质而定。实验室和实习作业占百分之五十到六十学业时间。
    讲授，同其他几种教授方法同等，为苏联一切高级学校采用。讲授规定该门科学的基本内容，介绍科学的原则及研究方法的原则给学生，指导学生们的进一步的一切形式的作业及自修。
    有些情形，讲授不伴同任何补充的作业，另一些情形在讲授之后要派下或是习题作业，或是研究班和实验室作业。
    研究这些科目时采用习题作业，即：物理学，数学，理论机械学，机械及机器理论，材料力学及其他等等。
    与习题作业同时还实行（特别是人文及理论科目）研究班作业。在这些作业上，高级学校的学生们要出席，并作具有初级科学研究工作性质的报告。这个毫无疑问会扩展研究班参加者们的科学眼界，并使他们认识到科学研究的最重要的方法。
    苏联高级学校里对实验室作业，附设医院作业等寄予特别的关注。实验室作业能使理论课程更深刻化，能使掌握到必要的试验经验，并使实际地认识专门的设备。实验室的作业上，学生都获得一个个人的工作位置，在共同监视下及讲师指导下，他在这个工作位置上完成学业的课题。
    在高级工科学校里，有若干科目的研究尚要伴同着计算和作图作业或者学年论文计划。学生一定须向讲座主任提出学年论文计划。
    在人文科学的高级学校里，学生要就主要的学科完成学级作业，通常是一学期一篇，甚或全个学年一篇。
    学年作业以及学年论文计划都追求着一个目的——使学生惯于独立工作，惯于广泛地利用参考书及原始材料。
    在上面我曾经提到过生产实习。
    生产实习在国民经济所有各部门的优秀企业和机关里组织：在工厂、制造厂，在矿坑里、学校里，在优良的乡村医院或区医院里、大学附设医院里，制药房里，在建筑工程上，在集体农庄和国营农场里。
    企业和机关常被批准给高级学校作为学生的实习基地，期限每每在四年至六年以上。
    学生在初年级实习时间内将认识到生产；高年级实习，便以技师、轮值工程师等的性质直接工作了。
    在高度熟练的专家造就中，所谓毕业前的实习实有特别的意义，所谓毕业前实习，便是毕业生最后的生产实习。假如大学生在生产实习中，认识了生产分部（车间，部，工作班）之一的工学过程的基本知识，并以相应各类工作者助手的性质而工作的话，那么在毕业前的实习时间内，这些大学毕业生便研究更宽广的生产部门，并执行负责工作者的任务——一个部门领导者的助手，轮值工程师，工艺师，农学者，动物饲养学者，机械师等等。毕业前的实习提供给大学生们以组织工作，管理生产机构的熟练经验，并使青年专家们认识企业的工学过程。大学生们在执行此种彼种生产任务的时候，便同时为毕业论文选择下必要的材料，使自己的计划和社会主义国民经济的需要更紧密地连结起来。常常听说，大学生们在毕业前的实习期间以自己的合理化建议而帮助解决了很重要的生产任务。
    概括地说，高级学校的生产实习期限为十周到三十六周。例如高级建筑工程学校的学生要在三十六周时间内进行实习，而高级医学校和高级教育学校的学生则在十到十五周时间内进行实习。
    学生生产实习的一般指导由高级学校相应的讲座来实现，最为熟练的教授和讲师则被任为直接指导者。国民经济的工作者亦积极参加学生生产实习的指导。每个企业或机关都分出一个专家，从事学生作业的一般指导。必要的情形下，这位专家可以免去执行自己的直接任务。
    一切学业过程的要求都完成之后，大学生们便要作毕业论文计划了。学位论文计划的主题在高级工科学校里是很宽泛很多样的。学生通常得到设计某一种复杂物件的课题：如机车、汽车、飞机、工厂、车间、发电站等等。
    在大学及其他人文科学的高级学校里，不作毕业论文计划，而规定国家考试，考三五门主要的学科。
    读完了高级学校、作过了毕业论文计划，或是国家考试及格了，便获得了高级学校毕业的毕业证书。
    最优秀的学生则颁发以优等毕业证书。优等毕业证书提供给高级学校毕业者以作研究生或者被录入各种科学远征队的权利。
    上面所述的苏联高级学校的结构和学业过程的组织顺序，保证了苏联国民经济及文化各部门高度熟练专家的培养。
    以上，我已经在相当程度上，描写了我们苏联高级学校网中培养青年专家方面的成就。为了实现规模宏大的斯大林五年计划，为了在我们国家建设共产主义，我们需要人数众多的苏维埃知识界的大军，这是全新的，根本与旧的、革命前的知识界不同的大军。我们已经有了这样的大军了。斯大林说，在苏联“诞生和形成了人数众多的新的智识分子，他们都是从工人阶级、农民和苏维埃职员中间出身，与我国人民血肉相连，根本不知道剥削制的羁轭为何物，仇恨剥削者，并决计忠诚服务于苏联各族人民的”（斯大林，《列宁主义问题》）。
