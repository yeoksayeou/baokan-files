　　Lushun-Dalian Guandong Bank Develops Savings Business
    [This Newspaper's News] In order to cooperate with the economic construction of 1950, the Lushun-Dalian Guandong Bank is vigorously developing savings work. Since the bank started its savings business in mid-June last year, with the assistance of party, government, organs, groups, and enterprise departments at all levels, and the support of the masses, it has successfully completed the savings task for the second half of last year. According to statistics: from June to the end of December last year, the number of savers was nearly 80,000, and the amount of savings was more than 360 million yuan, exceeding the task by 20 percent. There are more than 110,000 employees in the entire region, and the number of savers accounts for about 41 percent of the total number of employees; there are more than 68,000 households in the city, and the number of savings households accounts for slightly less than 7.2 percent. There are nearly 100,000 farmer households in the entire region, and the actual number of savings households also accounts for 13 percent of the total. From the above situation, it can be seen that the savings coverage last year was still not wide enough, and it has not yet become a mass movement. Therefore, the bank plans to further develop savings work this year, requiring the number of savers to increase to 140,000. The specific steps to be taken: from January to April, first carry out savings work for workers and public employees, planning to strive for 80 percent of staff and 60 percent of workers to participate in savings during this period. From April to June, focus on developing the savings movement among general urban residents, planning to mobilize 30 percent of residents to save. From June to December, fully turn to the countryside, planning to reach 35 percent of farming households with savings in the entire region during these six months. At present, the bank's savings work is being vigorously carried out.

　　旅大关东银行开展储蓄业务
    【本报讯】为配合一九五○年的经济建设，旅大区关东银行正大力开展储蓄工作。该行自去年六月中旬开办储畜业务以来，经各级党、政、机关、团体、企业部门的协助，和群众的拥护，已使去年下半年储蓄任务胜利完成。据统计：自去年六月至十二月底，储蓄人数近八万人，储蓄金额共三亿六千余万元，超过任务百分之二十。全区职工人员共十一万多人，储蓄人数占职工总数百分之四十一左右；市民共六万八千余户，储蓄户占百分之七．二弱。全区农民近十万户，实际储蓄户亦占全数的百分之十三。从上述情况中可以看出，去年储蓄面依然不够宽广，还没有成为一个群众性运动。因此，该行计划在本年内进一步深入开展储蓄工作，要求将储蓄人数增加到十四万人。进行的具体步骤：一至四月间，首先开展工人、公教人员的储蓄工作，计划在此期间争取百分之八十的职员、百分之六十的工人参加储蓄。从四到六月期间以开展城市一般居民的储蓄运动为主，计划动员百分之三十的居民进行储蓄。从六月到十二月期间，全力转向农村，计划在这六个月中，使全区农户储蓄户达到百分之三十五。现该行储蓄工作正大力开展中。
