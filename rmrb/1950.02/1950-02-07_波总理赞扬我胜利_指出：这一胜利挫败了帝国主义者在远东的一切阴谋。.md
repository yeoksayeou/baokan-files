Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, February 6th: According to the Polish Press Agency, Polish Prime Minister Cyrankiewicz, in the foreign policy section of his 1950 policy address to the Polish National Assembly on February 3rd, pointed out the great significance of the Chinese people's victory and its impact on the national liberation movement in Eastern colonies. He said: The historic victory of the Chinese people has thwarted all the imperialists' conspiracies in the Far East. This victory has greatly encouraged the struggle of all oppressed nations against colonial exploitation and has provided the progressive and democratic camp with a strong ally. Despite foreign interference, the Chinese people have won and overthrown Chiang Kai-shek's corrupt regime. The establishment of the People's Republic of China is an extremely heavy blow to the imperialist conquest plans that are eager to establish aggressive bases in China. It constitutes a huge crack in the imperialist system and opens a new page in the struggle for liberation of all nations suffering from imperialist oppression. It is the beginning of the victorious wave of national liberation movements in colonies and dependent countries.

　　The reason why we refuse to participate today in the meetings of the various committees of the United Nations that still have Kuomintang representatives is that we use this to show our firm will to have true Chinese representatives participate in this organization, and because we oppose the United States' attempt to use the United Nations as a place to carry out its conspiracies. We understand that only the representatives of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China can represent the Chinese people, and that it is an irresponsible attitude to discuss major international issues without the presence of representatives of 475 million people.

　　波总理赞扬我胜利
    指出：这一胜利挫败了帝国主义者在远东的一切阴谋。
    【新华社北京六日电】据波兰通讯社讯：波兰总理西伦凯维兹二月三日在波兰国民议会所作一九五○年施政报告的外交政策部分中，指出中国人民胜利的伟大意义及其对东方殖民地民族解放运动的影响。他说：中国人民的历史性胜利，挫败了帝国主义者在远东的一切阴谋。这一胜利大大地鼓舞了一切被压迫民族反对殖民剥削的斗争，并使进步与民主阵营得到了一个强有力的盟友。尽管有外国的干涉，但中国人民业已获胜，推翻了蒋介石的腐败政权。中华人民共和国的成立，是给予极欲在中国建立侵略基地的帝国主义征服计划的一个异常沉重的打击。它构成了帝国主义体系的巨大裂口，打开了一切遭受帝国主义压迫的民族争取解放斗争的新的一页。它是殖民地及附属国民族解放运动的胜利巨浪的开端。
    我们今天所以拒绝参加还有国民党出席的联合国各个委员会的会议，那是因为我们以此来表明我们要使真正的中国代表参与这一组织的坚定意志，那是因为我们反对美国想利用联合国作为遂行其阴谋诡计的场所的企图，我们明白：只有中华人民共和国中央人民政府的代表，才能代表中国人民，而且，没有四亿七千五百万人民的代表在场来讨论重大的国际问题，那是不负责任的态度。
