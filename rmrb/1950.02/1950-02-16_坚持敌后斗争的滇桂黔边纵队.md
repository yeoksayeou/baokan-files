　　The滇桂黔 Border Column Persists in Fighting Behind Enemy Lines
　　Guo Zhaohua
　　The滇桂黔 Border Column is a force that grew and strengthened during mass struggles. It persisted in fighting behind enemy lines in southwestern China for more than a year, with its activities covering western Guangxi, southwestern Guangxi, southwestern Guizhou, and the entire province of Yunnan. Over the past year, it has fought over eighty battles of various sizes, eliminating 4,500 enemy troops from the Twenty-Sixth Army's security regiments and reactionary landlord armed bandits. It won over 800 enemy and puppet soldiers to revolt. It liberated 31 county towns, over 150 townships, and 4 million people, accounting for one-third of Yunnan's total population. The liberated areas and guerrilla areas account for three-quarters of the province's area.

　　In April 1948, due to the victorious development of the national situation and the widespread anti-Chiang Kai-shek sentiment among the people of Yunnan, the people of southeastern Yunnan, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, launched an armed uprising in the Xishan area, giving birth to this force. After its establishment, this force, with local minority groups such as the Axi and Yi as its backbone, crushed the encirclement and suppression by an enemy puppet security regiment and advanced southward. It successively went through the Battle of Machang, captured Shizong, crossed the Panjiang River, and captured the county town of Guangnan. Then it marched towards the Yunnan-Vietnam border and joined forces with the桂滇 Border Column for reorganization and training. In an environment of extreme difficulty with jungles, miasma, and scarce materials and medicine, the troops implemented the border area party committee's call to "learn skills well and establish the滇桂黔 border area base." Ideological education was carried out among the cadres, summarizing the experience of struggle and studying policies. Among the soldiers, bitterness education was carried out, as well as hard training in military techniques.

　　On October 17, 1948, the troops received new orders to open up the southeastern Yunnan area and establish guerrilla bases. All commanders and fighters were in high spirits, crossing the 3,000-meter-high Goulou Mountains and Liuzhao Mountains, sweeping through the enemy's blockade lines, and marching for fourteen consecutive days and nights. Along the way, they passed through county towns such as Maguan, Xichou, Guangnan, Wenshan, Yanshan, and Qiubei. When the troops passed through townships, they carried out propaganda, organized the masses to resist conscription and taxation, strictly observed mass discipline, and won the support and love of the broad masses of the people. Every household voluntarily cooked meals to treat the troops. Farmers vied to act as guides for the troops, disregarding the danger of enemy bandits searching and killing from village to village, finding secret caves to shelter the sick and wounded, and taking care of them day and night, treating the soldiers as their own children.

　　After the troops arrived on the south bank of the Panjiang River, they focused on decentralizing development, going deep into the vast rural areas, closely contacting the masses, and launching struggles against conscription, taxation, and local tyrants. In December, they widely mobilized militiamen to cooperate in combat, successively annihilating the Third Battalion of the 578th Regiment of the enemy's Twenty-Sixth Army and a battalion and two companies of the First Security Regiment in dangerous mountainous areas such as Guangnan, Xichou, and Maguan.

　　Yunnan has many civilian firearms, and the people's anti-Chiang Kai-shek sentiment is high, so the organized militia is very strong, giving the enemy a great blow. Several major actions, such as: In January of last year, more than 4,000 militiamen were mobilized in Qiubei County to cooperate with a large detachment of troops in fighting at Mile Bay, repelling the enemy's invasion; in April, ethnic minorities in the Xishan area mobilized more than 3,000 militiamen to ambush the enemy's First Security Regiment, which was reinforcing Mile, on the 100-li front from Mile to Mipo, killing, wounding, and dispersing more than 300 enemies; on July 24th of last year, the enemy concentrated eight regiments of the Twenty-Sixth Army and other forces to launch a frantic invasion of our southeastern Yunnan liberated area. The militia of Luoping County defeated the attack of three enemy regiments, killing enemy regiment commander Huang Mingxian and more than 280 officers and soldiers; the militia in the Longhai Mountain area also bravely crushed the invasion of four enemy bandit regiments, fighting the enemy twelve times in three days and nights, killing and wounding 120 enemies. After the victories in Guangnan, Xichou, Maguan, and other places, the people's armed forces in western and southwestern Yunnan were also established one after another. A certain detachment developed towards the new northeastern Yunnan area and was warmly welcomed by the people in the new area. When a certain unit captured the county town of Huize, a soldier of a certain company was wounded. When the troops were stationed in the city for three days and then ordered to depart for the new area, the people of the whole city flocked out of the city to see them off and sent representatives to request us to leave this gloriously wounded soldier in the city for treatment. The people's love greatly educated the soldiers, and everyone said: "We can't let down such good people without winning a victory."

　　In the year that the troops persisted in fighting behind enemy lines, they have grown tenfold, becoming a clear banner of the people's struggle in the滇桂黔 border area. Under the sweeping of the field army of the People's Liberation Army, the Kuomintang army in Yunnan has been eliminated. Now, the team headquarters is launching study, transforming thinking, raising class consciousness, and striving to overcome various incorrect residual thoughts. 【Xinhua News Agency】

　　坚持敌后斗争的滇桂黔边纵队
    郭兆华
    滇桂黔边纵队是在群众斗争中成长和壮大起来的一支队伍，在西南敌后坚持斗争一年多时间，活动的地区遍布桂西、桂西南、黔西南及云南全省。一年来曾经大小战斗八十余次，歼敌第二十六军保安团、地主反动武装匪徒四千五百人，争取敌伪起义者八百人；解放县城三十一座，解放乡镇一百五十余处；解放人口四百万，占云南全省人口三分之一；解放区及游击区的面积占全省四分之三。
    一九四八年四月间，由于全国形势的胜利发展和云南人民反蒋匪情绪的普遍高涨，滇东南人民首先在中国共产党的领导下于西山地区发动武装起义，诞生了这支队伍。这支队伍成立后，即以当地的少数民族阿细、夷族等为骨干，粉碎敌伪保安团一个团的围攻，并向南进展。先后经过马厂之役，攻克师宗，横渡盘江，打下广南县城，继而向滇越边境进军，与桂滇边纵队会师进行整训。部队在丛林瘴气及物质医药极端困难的环境中，执行了边区党委“学好本领建立滇桂黔边区根据地”的号召，在干部中展开思想教育，总结斗争经验，学习政策，在战士中展开诉苦教育，及苦练军事技术。
    一九四八年十月十七日，部队接受了新的命令，开辟滇东南地区，建立游击根据地。全体指战员情绪高涨，翻越高达三千公尺的勾漏山脉、六诏山脉，横扫敌匪的封锁线，连续十四昼夜的行军，沿途经过马关、西畴、广南、文山、砚山、邱北等县城。部队路过乡镇，进行宣传，组织群众抗丁、抗款、并严格遵守群众纪律，深得广大人民的拥护与爱戴。村村户户自动做饭款待部队，农民们争着为部队当向导，不顾敌匪逐村搜索烧杀的危险，找寻秘密的岩洞掩护病号，并日夜照顾，把战士们看成自家的子弟。
    部队抵达盘江南岸后，即有重心地分散发展，深入广大农村，密切联系群众，发动抗丁、抗款、反恶霸等斗争。十二月间广泛动员民兵配合作战，先后于广南、西畴、马关等险要山地中全歼敌第二十六军五七八团第三营，及保一团一个营又两个连。
    云南民间枪支多，人民反蒋匪的情绪高涨，因此组织起来的民兵很坚强，给敌人的打击非常的大。几次较大的行动如：去年一月间，邱北县境曾经动员了民兵四千余人配合部队一个大队在弥勒湾作战，击退敌人的进犯；四月间西山区的少数民族曾经动员了三千多民兵，在弥勒至弥坡的一百里战线上伏击向弥勒增援的敌保一团，毙伤及打散敌人三百多；去年七月二十四日，敌曾集中第二十六军等共八个团的兵力，向我滇东南解放区疯狂进犯，罗平县民兵击溃敌人三个团的进攻，毙敌团长黄明贤以下官兵二百八十名；龙海山区的民兵亦英勇地粉碎敌匪四个团的进犯，在三昼夜里与敌作战十二次，毙伤敌一百二十名。广南、西畴、马关等地胜利战斗之后，滇西、滇西南各地人民武装也相继建立。某支队向滇东北新区发展，受到新区民众热烈欢迎。当某部攻克会泽县城时，某连一战士负伤，当部队在城内驻了三天，又奉命向新区出发的时候，全城民众蜂拥出城欢送，并派出代表向我要求留下这光荣负伤的战士在城里医治。群众的热爱，使战士们受到很大的教育，大家都说：“不打个胜仗对不起这样好的老百姓。”
    部队在坚持敌后斗争的一年中，已经壮大了十倍，成为滇桂黔边区人民斗争鲜明的旗帜。在解放军野战大军的扫荡下，云南国民党军已被消灭。现在队部正在展开学习，改造思想，提高阶级觉悟，努力克服各种不正确的残余思想。  【新华社讯】
