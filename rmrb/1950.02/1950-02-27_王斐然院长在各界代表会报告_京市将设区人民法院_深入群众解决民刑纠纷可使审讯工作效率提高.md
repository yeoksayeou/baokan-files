　　【Beijing News】Wang Feiran, President of the Beijing Municipal People's Court, reported to the second session of the second Beijing Municipal People's Representatives Conference yesterday (26th) that the Municipal People's Court will establish District People's Courts in various districts of Beijing to initially resolve civil and criminal disputes. He first explained that the Supreme People's Court attaches great importance to the establishment of District People's Courts and has recently held several meetings to carefully study and decide to pilot the program in Beijing and Tianjin. The work task of the Beijing Municipal People's Court this year is to first establish District Courts. Doing so can facilitate the people in resolving civil and criminal disputes. He continued to point out that the establishment of District People's Courts has many benefits. First, in the past, people throughout the city with disputes needing resolution would all gather at the Municipal Court. From last year to now, in less than a year, although more than 15,000 cases have been closed, more than 3,000 cases are still backlogged. This is a great loss to the interests of the parties involved. The establishment of District People's Courts will enable people's disputes to be resolved more quickly and satisfactorily. Second, the suburbs are far from the Municipal Court, and it is costly and troublesome for people in the suburbs to resolve disputes. The establishment of District Courts eliminates this situation. Third, District People's Courts can more easily go deep into the masses for on-site trials. This on-site investigation enables the truth of the matter to be understood more quickly and accurately, thus greatly improving work efficiency.

　　王斐然院长在各界代表会报告
    京市将设区人民法院
    深入群众解决民刑纠纷可使审讯工作效率提高
    【北京讯】北京市人民法院王斐然院长，昨（二十六）日在京市第二届第二次各界人民代表会议上，向代表报告市人民法院即将在京市各区设立区人民法院，以初步解决民事、刑事纠纷。他首先说明：最高人民法院非常重视各区设立区人民法院，最近曾召开过多次会议，慎重研讨，决定先在京、津两地试行，京市人民法院今年工作任务，便决定先建立区法院，这样做，可以便利人民解决民事、刑事纠纷。他继续指出：设立区人民法院，有很多好处，第一、过去全市人民有了纠纷需要解决，都集中在市法院，去年到现在，还不到一年，虽然结案有一万五千多起，但还积压了三千多起，这对当事人的利益，是一个很大的损失，成立区人民法院，便可使人民纠纷，更能迅速圆满的解决。第二、郊区离市法院较远，郊区人民解决纠纷，便要劳民伤财，设立区法院，便没有这种情形。第三、区人民法院更易于深入群众实地就审。这样实地调查，使问题真象更迅速确实的得到明了，因此工作效率也将大大提高。
