　　"The Invisible Front" has high educational significance
　　Méi Lìngyí
    Facts prove to us that after the reactionary forces are eliminated, they will inevitably carry out various sabotage activities. Although this is a death struggle of the remaining bandits, and although we have enough strength to completely eliminate the special agents, we must strengthen our vigilance and vigorously carry out this struggle.
    How is the struggle against special agents being carried out now? The film "The Invisible Front" has specific manifestations. Through the public security cadres' cracking down on the entire activities of the bandit special agent Li Tianmin and Zhou Shaomei, we can see that: first, the anti-bandit special agent struggle is a kind of investigation and research work, and it is a work that relies on the masses; second, the anti-special agent struggle requires responsible cadres of agencies and factories to overcome paralysis, overcome bureaucracy, and overcome careless work styles, otherwise, it will give the enemy an opportunity to exploit, causing certain losses; finally, the anti-bandit special agent struggle is carried out on the basis of a lenient policy, and there are different methods for die-hard special agent leaders and for coerced elements: the latter are welcomed to confess their sins and serve the people, while the former will be sanctioned by the people. This is the main ideological content of "The Invisible Front."
    Based on the above ideological content, the people's film "The Invisible Front" has a fundamental difference from those "spy films" made by the United States and the cultural lackeys of the Chiang bandit gang, which were once liked by petty bourgeois audiences. "Spy films" not only attract the citizen audience with tortuous and thrilling plots, but also show off to the people by praising special agents: the reactionary ruling class has a way to deal with resisters. Our films, such as "The Invisible Front," also have tense and moving stories, which are a reflection of real life; they also want to praise, because the anti-bandit special agent struggle of revolutionary public security cadres is implementing the will of the broad masses of people, conforming to the people's requirements, and serving the revolution and the people; they also want to demonstrate, to tell the remaining bandits that we have enough strength to completely eliminate the invisible enemy. But, more importantly, such films, like other themed people's films, have high and active educational significance, whether for public security cadres, for responsible cadres of agencies and factories, or for coerced elements who unfortunately fell for it for a while.
    The struggle against special agents is still going on seriously, especially in the newly liberated areas (not limited to cities). Without exaggeration, "The Invisible Front" will help to achieve victory in this struggle. In the past and future realities, we can see countless meritorious services like those of the reconnaissance captain; we can also see the arrest of large and small bandit special agent leaders like Li Tianmin and Zhou Shaomei; how many coerced elements like Cui Guofang confess their sins and start anew; and some cadres like Secretary Ma see themselves in the film, reflect on themselves, and no longer need to wait for the lessons of facts.

　　《无形的战线》有高度的教育意义
　　梅令宜
    事实为我们证明，反动派在他们的武装力量被消灭之后，必然要进行种种阴谋破坏的活动。虽然这是残余匪帮的垂死挣扎，虽然我们有足够的力量把特务匪完全消灭，但是，我们必须加强警惕，大力进行这一斗争。
    反特务的斗争，在现在，是怎样进行的呢？在电影《无形的战线》中有着具体的表现。通过公安干部破获匪特李天民与周少梅的全部活动，我们可以看到：首先，反匪特斗争是一种调查研究的工作，是依靠群众的工作；其次，反特务斗争要求机关、工厂负责干部克服麻痹思想、克服事务主义、克服粗枝大叶的作风，否则，就给敌人以钻空子的机会，造成某些损失；最后，反匪特斗争是本着宽大政策进行的，对于顽固到底的特务头子与对于胁从分子有不同的办法：欢迎后者的坦白自新而为人民服务，前者必受到人民的制裁。这，也就是《无形的战线》的主要的思想内容。
    基于上述的思想内容，人民电影《无形的战线》，和那些曾被小市民观众喜欢过的、美国制的与蒋匪帮文化喽啰们制的“间谍片”，有着基本上的区别。“间谍片”不仅以曲折、惊险的情节吸引了市民观众，同时，还在以颂扬特务向人民示威：反动统治阶级是有办法对付反抗者的。我们的电影，如《无形的战线》也有紧张而动人的故事，这是现实生活的反映；也要颂扬，因为革命的公安干部的反匪特斗争是执行广大人民的意志、符合人民的要求的，是为革命、为人民服务的；也要示威，要告诉残余匪帮，我们有足够的力量把无形的敌人完全消灭。但是，更重要的，这样的电影，正和其他主题的人民电影一样，具有高度的、积极的教育意义，无论对于公安干部说，对于机关、工厂负责干部说，对于不幸一时上当的胁从分子说，都是这样的。
    反特务的斗争还在严重的进行着，特别是在新解放了的地区中（不限于城市）。毫不夸张地说，《无形的战线》将有助于这一斗争的取得胜利。我们在过去和今后的现实中，同样的可以看见无数的如侦察队长那样的立功；也可以看见大大小小的如李天民、周少梅那样的匪特头子落网；多少如崔国芳那样的胁从分子坦白自新；而一些如马秘书那样的干部从影片中照见自己，有所反省，不必再等待事实的教训了。
