　　The ninth issue of "Chinese Children" has been published. The content of this issue focuses on supporting the People's Liberation Army. In the first article, the editors tell their dear young friends: "As our motherland is about to be completely liberated, we should celebrate the Spring Festival by first paying tribute to the meritorious People's Liberation Army, and we should also offer our condolences to the families of martyrs and soldiers." Little reporter "Flying All Over the Sky" visited the People's Liberation Army this time and told the children: The People's Liberation Army is not only a combat team, but also a cultural school, and a production army; they are stepping up their training, preparing to liberate Taiwan. Miao Peishi tells children a story of the heroic fighting of the People's Liberation Army in the long poem "Ten-Man Bridge." "The Secret in the Wooden House" introduces a book about how the Soviet Young Pioneer Timur and his companions cared for the Red Army. Two other children wrote in "Everyone Writes" about how much they love the comrades of the People's Liberation Army. In addition to the above, in terms of natural science, there is Ali's "How Did the Earth Come About?" and Gao Shiqi's "Our Soil Mother (Part 2)," songs include Zhang Zhimin's lyrics and Du Yijia's music, "Come and See," and the story "Table and Chair Committee," the long serial "Forty-Five Thousand Mile Journey," etc.
