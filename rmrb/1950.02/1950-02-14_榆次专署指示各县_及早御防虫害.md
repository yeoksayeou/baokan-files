Yuci Prefecture Directs All Counties to Prevent and Control Insect Pests Early

[This newspaper reports] The Yuci Prefecture of Shanxi Province instructed all counties to promptly carry out the prevention and control of diseases and insect pests, eliminate insect eggs, and reduce losses from insect pests this year. Last autumn, various insect pests laid eggs in tree bark, weeds, dead vines, pod husks, and waste cotton, which was mostly ignored by the masses in various places. This year, with the warming of spring, larvae will hatch, and one female insect can breed hundreds or even thousands of offspring. In addition, there was very little snowfall last winter and this spring, and not many insect eggs were frozen to death, so all localities must pay attention to eliminating them as early as possible. In particular, areas where insect pests have occurred in the past year should extensively publicize to the masses, immediately sweep the weeds on the edge of the fields, accumulate them in one place and burn them to reduce the spread of insect pests this year. All localities should prepare medicines for preventing and controlling diseases and insect pests as early as possible, such as seed dressing medicines and red alum. When sowing this spring, seeds should also be turned over and dried to avoid insect pests.

　　榆次专署指示各县
    及早御防虫害
    【本报讯】山西省榆次专署指示各县，即早进行防治病虫害，消灭害虫伏卵，减少今年虫害的损失。去秋，各种害虫产卵于树皮、野草、死蔓、荚皮、败絮中，多为各地群众所忽视。今年春暖雏化，一个雌虫，就可滋生几百甚至几千。加之去冬今春雪量很少，各种虫卵冻死的不多，各地必须注意即早进行消灭。特别是去年已发生过虫害的地区，应当广泛向群众宣传，立即将地边杂草，扫积一处用火焚化，以减少今年虫害蔓延。各地应即早准备防治病虫害的药品，如拌种药及红矾等。今春播种时，种子也要进行翻晒，以免发生虫害。
