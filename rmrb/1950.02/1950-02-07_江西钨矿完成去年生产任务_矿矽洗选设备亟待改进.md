Xinhua News Agency, Hankou: The Jiangxi Tungsten Mine has completed 98.1% of its total production task for 1949. Jiangxi is a well-known tungsten mining area in the country, with mineral deposits distributed in 21 counties in southwestern Jiangxi. After southwestern Jiangxi was liberated in September last year, the state-owned Jiangxi Tungsten and Tin Mining Company convened a production meeting in October, deciding to support private tungsten mines and focus on restoring production in state-owned mines. By the end of November, 1,100 private mine shafts and state-owned mines had resumed work, and production had recovered to one-third of the pre-war peak output. As of December last year, the Jiangxi Tungsten Mine had completed 98.1% of the total task stipulated by the production meeting. Since liberation, the situation of the miners has greatly improved. As the mining company directly purchases ore sand from miners in private mine shafts, the intermediate exploitation by merchants that miners have suffered for years has been eliminated. The sand extraction rate (the amount of tungsten sand extracted by miners that the mine owner takes as rent) by the mine owners has also been reduced from 8% or 12% to 5% after consultation between the mining company and the mine owners. The pressing problem currently facing the mining area is to improve the washing and beneficiation equipment for the ore, in order to increase production and quality.

　　江西钨矿完成去年生产任务
    矿矽洗选设备亟待改进
    【新华社电】汉口讯：江西钨矿已完成一九四九年生产总任务的百分之九十八点一。江西为全国著名钨矿产区，矿藏分布于赣西南二十一县。赣西南于去年九月间解放后，十月间国营的江西钨锡矿业公司即召开生产会议，决定扶助私营钨矿，并有重点地恢复公营钨矿的生产。至十一月底，已有一千一百个私营矿穴及公营矿场复工，产量亦已恢复到战前最高产量的三分之一。截至去年十二月份止，江西钨矿已完成生产会议所规定总任务百分之九十八点一。解放以后，矿工境遇已大为改善。由于矿业公司直接向私营矿穴矿工收购矿砂，矿工们历年来所受商贩的中间剥削已经得以免除；矿穴主对矿工的抽砂率（矿工采掘的钨砂，矿主要抽一定数目作为矿租），经过矿业公司和矿穴主协商结果，也由百分之八或十二减至百分之五。目前矿区亟待解决的问题是健全矿矽的洗、选设备，以提高产量和质量。
