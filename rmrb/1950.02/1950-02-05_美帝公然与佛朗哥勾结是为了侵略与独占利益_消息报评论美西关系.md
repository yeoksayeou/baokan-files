Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 4th. TASS, Moscow:
Izvestia recently published an article commenting on the relationship between the United States and Franco's Spain, stating: U.S. Secretary of State Acheson made a statement on January 18 regarding the U.S. policy toward Franco's Spain. This statement demonstrates that for the purposes of the United States' aggressive policy and to serve the interests of American banks and monopolies, the leaders of the United States openly disregard their international obligations and the will of the United Nations. On December 12, 1946, and November 17, 1947, the United Nations General Assembly successively adopted resolutions condemning the Spanish fascist regime for threatening peace and international security, and stipulating that all United Nations members recall their diplomatic representatives from Madrid.
Acheson's statement not only acknowledges that the U.S. government has been concealing its collusion with Franco, but also announces that the U.S. government has proposed to Franco to begin negotiations on the conclusion of a treaty of friendship, trade, and navigation. According to foreign newspapers, Franco, who is on the verge of economic disaster, is seeking large loans from the U.S. Export-Import Bank. As the British Tribune pointed out: the United States' current change of attitude toward Spain is encouraging Franco at the most critical moment of his entire career. Therefore, Acheson's statement shows that the U.S. ruling clique, disregarding the indignation caused by the Franco regime among broad democratic people worldwide, is wholeheartedly trying to save it.

　　美帝公然与佛朗哥勾结是为了侵略与独占利益
    消息报评论美西关系
    【新华社北京四日电】据塔斯社莫斯科讯：消息报顷著文评论美国与佛朗哥西班牙之间的关系称：美国国务卿艾奇逊在一月十八日发表了一篇关于美国对佛朗哥西班牙政策的声明。这一声明表示出：为了美国侵略政策的目的，并为了符合美国银行和垄断企业的利益，美国的领袖们公然不顾他们的国际义务与联合国组织的意志。在一九四六年十二月十二日及一九四七年十一月十七日，联合国大会曾先后通过决定，谴责西班牙法西斯政权威胁和平与国际安全，并规定所有联合国会员自马德里召回各该国的外交代表。
    艾奇逊的声明，不仅承认了美国官方一直在掩盖着它们与佛朗哥的勾结活动，而且，他还宣布美国政府已向佛朗哥提议：开始举行关于缔结友好、贸易及航运条约的谈判。据外国报纸报道：处在经济灾难边缘的佛朗哥，正在向美国进出口银行要求大量贷款。正如英国论坛周刊曾指出的：美国现在之改变对西班牙的态度，正是在佛朗哥全部事业中最危急的时刻鼓励他。因此，艾奇逊的声明表示出：美国统治集团不顾佛朗哥政权在全世界广大民主人士间所引起的愤慨，却一心一意地要挽救它。
