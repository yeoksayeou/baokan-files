Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, February 12th: The US government is further implementing its plan for an "undeclared peace" with Japan. According to a United Press report from Tokyo, MacArthur announced on the 9th that the US government has invited the Japanese government to establish "offices similar to consulates" in New York, San Francisco, Los Angeles, and Honolulu to "promote trade and handle the affairs of Japanese residents and property." On the same day, a US State Department spokesman declared that the US hopes other countries will also extend similar "invitations" to the Japanese government, allowing it to establish such consulates in various countries. A Japanese Foreign Ministry spokesman also announced on the 9th that each of these consular institutions would be "headed by a diplomatic official of the rank of Consul General."

Prior to this, the US government had a plan to conclude a "separate peace treaty with Japan" as soon as possible, excluding the Soviet Union and New China, which was decided by the US and British foreign ministers at the Washington Conference last September. This plan included simultaneously concluding a "US-Japan alliance" to allow the US to continue its disguised occupation of Japan, but it was opposed by the US Department of Defense and MacArthur. According to a United Press report on January 14th: "The argument of the US military against an early peace treaty with Japan is that under the current occupation, the cost for the US to 'exchange for security' in Japan is minimal." The report also revealed that the US military had gained the "upper hand" in the dispute with the State Department on this issue. "Acheson seems to have agreed with this argument and is carefully considering taking some temporary measures to bring Japan into the international community before a peace treaty is signed." The "temporary measures" Acheson is considering are clearly the US government's unilaterally announced action of inviting Japan to establish consulates in the US and other countries.

### 美帝阴谋实行“不宣而和”  竟允日在美设领事馆

　　美帝阴谋实行“不宣而和”
    竟允日在美设领事馆
    【新华社北京十二日电】美国政府正进一步实行其对日本“不宣而和”的计划。据合众社东京讯，麦克阿瑟于九日宣布：美国政府已邀请日本政府在纽约、旧金山、洛杉矶和檀香山四地，设立“类似领事馆的办事处”，“促进贸易并处理日侨和财产问题”。同日，美国国务院发言人宣称：美国希望其他国家也向日本政府提出同样的“邀请”，准其在各国成立这种领事馆。日本外务省发言人亦于九日宣布，每一个这种领事机构，将由“总领事一级的外交人员负责”。
    在此之前，美国政府曾有尽早缔结一个排斥苏联与新中国参加的“单独对日和约”的计划，这是美英外长去年九月在华盛顿会议时所决定。这个计划包括同时缔结一个“美日联盟”，使美国继续保持对日本的变相占领，但遭到美国国防部及麦克阿瑟的反对。据合众社一月十四日电称：“反对早日缔结对日和约的美国军人的论点是：在目前占领情况下，美国在日‘换取安全’所出的代价最小。”该电并透露，美国军人在与国务院关于这个问题的争论中，已占“上风”。“艾奇逊似已表示同意这一论点，并正慎重考虑采取一些临时办法，以便在和约签订之前，即把日本带到国际大家庭中”。艾奇逊所考虑的“临时办法”，显然就是美国政府现在所片面宣布的邀请日本在美国及其他国家设立领事馆的行动。
