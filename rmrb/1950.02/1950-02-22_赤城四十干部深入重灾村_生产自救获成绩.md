　　Forty Cadres of Chicheng Go Deep into Heavily Afflicted Villages
    Production for Self-Relief Achieves Success
    [Our Newspaper's News] Responsible cadres such as the head of Chicheng County, the Secretary of the Chicheng County Party Committee, and the Director of the County Supply and Marketing Cooperative, in Chahar Province, led over forty cadres in going deep into twenty-six heavily afflicted villages, including Sanhe Village and the South and North Yinjiagou villages, to lead production for disaster relief, and have already achieved successes. As soon as they arrived in the villages, they universally organized the masses to cut branches, weave, and dig up medicinal herbs for production. The government provided loans to the most difficult cases to support production. The seven most difficult households in Hushanzhuang were given relief with clothing and grain, and were immediately organized for production, and the problem of their livelihood was solved. The supply and marketing cooperative established three cooperatives in Changshendi, Nanbuzi, and Shenjiagou villages, specializing in purchasing sideline products such as mats, pot lids, charcoal, and medicinal materials, and promoting them to the outside world. According to statistics from the 18th of last month, the Changshendi and Shenjiagou cooperatives collected over 61,000 jin of branches, 490 mats, 50 pairs of shoes, 36 loads of baskets, and over 3,000 jin of charcoal, as well as a large number of pot lids. They exchanged these for over 12,000 jin of millet, naked oats, and beans, over 500 jin of edible salt, and over 20 zhang of homespun cloth, solving the living and production problems of some of the disaster victims.
    The problems that need to be further solved at present are: 1. The County Supply and Marketing Cooperative originally planned to buy over 30,000 jin of branches (to be woven into medicine baskets and sold with the medicine), but now it has collected over 60,000 jin, but the sales channels are very narrow. In order to solve the serious difficulties in the heavily afflicted villages as soon as possible, it has been decided to first collect the branches from villages such as Sanhe Village and Shenjiagou Village. The County Supply and Marketing Cooperative should send cadres to contact the Longyan Iron Mine to discuss the sales of branches, so as to promote sales on a large scale. 2. Women do not have many avenues for production. In addition to calling on women to learn weaving techniques, it is necessary to mobilize women to collect firewood, deliver manure, and save male labor to participate in other production.

　　赤城四十干部深入重灾村
    生产自救获成绩
    【本报讯】察哈尔省赤城县县长、中共县委书记、县供销社主任等负责干部，带领四十余干部，深入三合村和南、北尹家沟等二十六个重灾村，领导生产救灾，已收到成绩。他们一到村，普遍组织群众割条、编织、刨药等生产。政府对最困难的给予贷款，扶助搞生产。胡山庄的最困难的七户，救济了衣、粮，立即组织生产，生活问题就解决了。供销社在长伸地、南卜子、沈家沟等三村，建立起三个合作社，专门收购席子、锅帽、木炭、药材等副业产品，向外推销。据上月十八日统计，长伸地、沈家沟两合作社，收了条子六万一千余斤、席子四百九十领，鞋五十双，筐子三十六担，木炭三千余斤，还有大批锅盖。共换回小米、莜面、豆类等一万二千余斤，食盐五百余斤，土布二十余丈，解决了一部分灾民的生活生产问题。
    目前需继续解决的问题是：一、县供销社原计划买条子三万多斤（准备编成药筐，随药出卖），现已收了六万多斤，但销路很狭。为了尽先解决重灾村的严重困难，决定先收三合村、沈家沟等村的条子。县供销社应派干部到龙烟铁矿接洽条子的销路问题，以便大量推销。二、妇女们的生产门路不多，除号召妇女学习编织技术外，要动员妇女打柴、送粪、省出男劳力参加其他生产。
