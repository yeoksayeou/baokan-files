　　Capital Store Employees
    Hold Spring Festival Celebration
    [This newspaper's dispatch] Capital Store employees will hold a grand Spring Festival celebration. Trade unions from twelve industries including the National Pharmaceutical Company organized a joint preparatory committee for the Spring Festival celebration, deciding to hold the celebration at the Zhongshan Park Music Hall on the 19th and 20th (Lunar New Year's third and fourth day) from 12:00 noon to 5:00 pm each day. The programs will be entirely performed by the store employees themselves. The content includes the dramas "Breaking Superstition," "What's the Result?" (describing the labor-capital relations after liberation), and "Creation"; operas include "Brother and Sister Reclaiming Wasteland," "Great Reclamation," and "New Little Cowherd." In addition, there will be programs such as Zhang Xiaosan buying public bonds, matching Spring Festival couplets, Chinese martial arts, and singing. Approximately 12,000 members and guests are expected to participate at that time.
