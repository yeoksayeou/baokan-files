Real Estate Tax Regulations Require Owners to Deliver in Person; Finance Bureau Does Not Send Personnel to Collect
	Swindler Li Qianjin Arrested for Impersonating Tax Collector
    [Beijing News] The Seventh Police Station of the Fourth Branch of the Beijing Public Security Bureau recently uncovered a swindler named Li Qianjin who impersonated a Finance Bureau staff member, using the pretext of investigating real estate tax to defraud people. The perpetrator, posing as a Finance Bureau official, went to the Great Buddha Temple in Beijing to find the abbot, Chunshan, claiming to be there to understand the situation. He stated that the temple owed over two million yuan in real estate tax and should first pay a 2% handling fee, thus swindling 49,500 yuan in People's Currency and taking one copy of the real estate tax notice. Afterwards, Chunshan felt something was amiss and reported it to the Third Branch of the Public Security Bureau. When the perpetrator returned to Kunling Temple to swindle money, he was apprehended by the Seventh Police Station of the Fourth Branch of the Public Security Bureau. After this case occurred, reporters visited the responsible person of the Finance Bureau. According to them: The Finance Bureau's real estate tax notices are entirely delivered to property owners by the post office, and it is stipulated that taxes should be paid by the owners themselves at the city's various tax collection points, which has already been announced. The bureau has never sent personnel to collect payments in person, and there is no "handling fee" regulation whatsoever. In the future, if property owners discover anyone claiming to be from the bureau collecting payments, it is undoubtedly a swindler, and they should be immediately handed over to the police station for legal action.

　　地产税规定业主亲送  财政局并未派人收款
    骗子李前进冒名收税被捕
    【北京讯】本市公安局内四分局第七派出所近查获一自称李前进的骗子冒充财政局工作人员，以调查地产税为名，到处行骗。该犯曾以财政局人员名义到本市大佛寺找住持纯山，说是来庙了解情况，并称该庙负担地产税二百余万元，应先交百分之二的手续费，当诈去人民券四万九千五百元，并将地产税通知书取去一联。事后纯山感觉有异，遂报告公安第三分局，而于该犯复到昆灵寺骗财时，乃为内四公安分局第七派出所捕获。此案发生后，记者曾走访财政局负责人，据称：财政局地产税通知书，完全交邮局寄投业主，并规定税款应由业主亲自到本市各税款代收处交付，已经布告在案。该局从未派员到各处亲自收款，更无什么“手续费”的规定。今后，各业主如再发现有自称该局人员到各处收款的，显系骗子无疑，即可扭送各派出所法办。
