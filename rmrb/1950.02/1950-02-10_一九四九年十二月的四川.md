　　Sichuan in December 1949
　　December of 1949 was an extraordinary month for Sichuan. It marked the last days of the Chiang bandits in Sichuan. Their decades of criminal rule rapidly disintegrated within a month, while the people of Sichuan, after enduring long years of darkness, welcomed the dawn.
　　In November, as the People's Liberation Army (PLA) advanced up the Yangtze River from western Hubei and along the Sichuan-Hunan highway, sweeping away the remaining bandits on both banks of the Yangtze in eastern Sichuan, Yang Sen, the pseudo-mayor of Chongqing, was holding a military conference in Chongqing, planning to organize an "Anti-Communist People-Protecting Army" to stop the PLA's advance. He demanded that each jia (a group of households) provide one conscript and each county establish a division. Many kind and poor farmers, wearing their usual tattered work clothes and carrying all sorts of broken guns, were escorted by baojia chiefs to enlist. In Dazu County, a fortune teller who set up a stall at a crossroads was even "invited" to become a company commander. The bandit Hu Zongnan also hurriedly transferred troops from northwestern Sichuan to reinforce Chongqing via the Chengdu-Chongqing highway. However, by the time Hu's troops reached Yongchuan, Chongqing had already been liberated. All the reactionaries' fantasies were shattered, and they began to flee in disarray. The Chengdu-Chongqing highway, the banks of the Fu River, and all roads leading to Chengdu were clogged with retreating trucks and soldiers. Many of the troops were drafted laborers, carrying the looted goods for them. There were also fashionably dressed dancing girls, monkeys, and foreign dogs, forming a chaotic procession.
　　These greedy and shameless bandits did not waste a minute in looting before their demise. They kicked open the doors of cigarette shops and candy stores, grabbing large quantities of goods. They snatched leather shoes and rubber shoes in department stores. In Hechuan County (where the Jialing, Qu, and Fu Rivers converge), hundreds of bottles of Gaoshengyuan's Daqu liquor and dozens of cartons of canned goods were looted. Cotton yarn, maltose, salt, vegetable oil, cigarettes, electrical supplies, jewelry, and clothing were all plundered. Qing Yuncan, the pseudo-garrison commander of Zigong City, embezzled twelve boxes of silver dollars, each containing five thousand yuan, from the pseudo-Central Bank before fleeing. He disguised them as military supplies and transported them to Weiyuan in large trucks. On December 5, when the People's Liberation Army approached Zigong from Dengjingguan in Fushun County, he even ordered the pseudo-mayor Gan Jipi to raise 100,000 silver dollars for him. However, due to the urgency of time, he "disappointedly" fled. Suining was the location of the pseudo-12th Special Administrative Region. The pseudo-commissioner Li Zemin looted eight large leather suitcases full of gold, silver, and soft goods, and fled with his wife in a sedan car, "laden with women and treasures." This was the bandits' skill. They also had the ability to make the PLA chase them breathlessly. At the Bajiang Restaurant in Tongliang County, dozens of bandit soldiers had ordered food and were preparing to have a full meal before fleeing, but as soon as they heard that the PLA was coming, they ran away. The bandit leader Yang Sen (who had fled from Chongqing to Tongliang) had just finished getting his haircut and, without even washing his hair or shaving, jumped into his jeep and fled. On the evening of December 2, when the bandit Yang fled to Tongnan, the pseudo-government of Tongnan had prepared a banquet to welcome this "Mayor of Chongqing." Yang's jeep arrived, but he did not attend the banquet. He jumped out of the car in panic and told his chief of staff to flee quickly. When a Kuomintang soldier was asked by the people about the PLA, he said, "We haven't even seen what the PLA looks like." On December 27, when the PLA raised the flag of victory in Chengdu, all the bandits in Sichuan were wiped out.
　　With the demise of the Chiang bandits, the people emerged from their hiding places and took to the streets, welcoming the PLA with laughter. Although December in Sichuan was deep winter, the hearts of the Sichuan people felt like a bright spring. On both banks of the Yangtze River, on the banks of the Jialing River, and in all cities and towns, grand welcomes, celebrations, and parades were held everywhere. In all these occasions, gongs and drums were deafening, the songs of liberation echoed everywhere, the people's yangko dance was performed with abandon, and people shouted out the words that had been suppressed in their hearts for so long. Portraits of Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu were always surrounded by the crowd. The solemn five-star red flag – the flag of victory – flew high in the sky over Sichuan. The people's era had arrived.
　　Beibei, a scenic town on the banks of the Jialing River, was liberated on December 2. When the rousing "March of the Volunteers" was broadcast through loudspeakers, people flooded the streets like a tide. They cheered, "Long live Chairman Mao!" "Long live the Chinese Communist Party!" "Long live the People's Republic of China!" A grand parade of more than 20,000 people was held on the 18th. A cartoon at the Girls' Normal School Affiliated High School depicted a sun slowly rising from the mountains, shining its light over the earth, with the words: "The sky is truly bright!" In Ba County, near Chongqing, the owners of sugar shops and the clerks of cigarette stalls wanted to give their sugar and cigarettes to the PLA soldiers to eat, but the PLA soldiers politely declined and purchased them fairly with Renminbi. Hechuan, Tongnan, and Suining, along the Fu River, were all liberated in early December. In Suining County, the people vied to clean the streets and scrub off the deceptive slogans left by the Chiang bandits on the walls the day before the PLA arrived. Students in Hechuan organized "Youth Work Teams" to conduct propaganda. Store clerks learned the "three steps back, one step forward" yangko dance steps in the shops, and even shy girls joyfully danced the yangko in the streets.
　　In Jiangjin, Baisha, and Luxian, upstream on the Yangtze River, the people welcomed their own troops. Workers at the 23rd Arsenal in Luxian immediately sent two wooden boats from the factory across the river to welcome the PLA as soon as the gunfire stopped on the opposite bank of Taian Township, and planted the secretly made five-star red flag on the shore. Before liberation, to prevent sabotage by the bandits, they took out the stockpiled guns and armed themselves, and prepared chlorine gas, nitric acid, and artillery, in order to feign destruction when necessary. Farmers in Baisha held red and green flags celebrating liberation, leading cattle and carrying hoes, participating in the parade. When the PLA soldiers wearing red star cap badges appeared in Jiangjin County, the welcoming red lanterns lit up the entire city.
　　Zigong City, famous for its salt production, was liberated one night. When the signal flares soared brightly into the sky, thunderous cheers shook the heavens. Everyone leaned out of their windows to watch, clap, and cheer, some shedding tears of joy. The PLA soldiers resting in front of the Fuhua Tea House were tightly surrounded by people eager to chat with them. Some curious children secretly touched the PLA soldiers' hands to see if they had red hair, as the Chiang bandits had spread such rumors. On the 16th, a military-civilian get-together was held in Zigong, with more than 20,000 people singing together: "Arise! Ye who refuse to be slaves!..." In Neijiang, the passage on the Chengdu-Chongqing highway and the sugar-producing area of Sichuan, the people presented the PLA with valuable gifts, more than 2,000 jin of local sugarcane and sugar.
　　The joy of December was not only in the major transportation routes and riverside towns. In Dazu, between the Chengdu-Chongqing Road and the Jialing River, when only one instructor of the People's Liberation Army went there (he was going to establish a county people's government office), the people who had been waiting for a long time immediately rejoiced. Firecrackers and cheers resounded throughout the city, and the students immediately took flags and marched in a yangko parade. They had been secretly practicing yangko dance while attending classes before liberation. The students who were forcibly taken back home by their parents had tears in their eyes; some female students had their luggage moved back, but they stayed at the school and did not go home. On the 25th, Tongliang County held a celebration rally and parade of 20,000 people in misty rain. Although the weather was gloomy and the roads were muddy, it could not stop the people's fiery hearts celebrating liberation. Late at night, the city was still brightly lit with celebratory lights, and songs floated: "...Towards freedom, towards the sun, towards the new China, emit a light of ten thousand zhang!"

　　一九四九年十二月的四川
    一九四九年的十二月，在四川说来是不平凡的。十二月是四川蒋匪的末日，他们几十年来的罪恶统治，在一个月内就迅速地土崩瓦解了。而四川人民却在渡过了漫长的黑暗岁月后，迎接着黎明的到来。
    十一月，自鄂西溯江而上的解放军与由川湘公路挺进的解放军，正在横扫川东长江两岸残匪的时候，伪重庆市长杨森却在重庆召开着伪卫戍部的辖区军事会议，计划着组织“反共保民军”来阻止解放军前进。他要每甲出壮丁一名，每县建立一个师。许多善良的贫苦农民，穿着平日做活时的破烂衣裳，背着各式各样的破枪，被保甲长押送着去入伍了。在大足县，将一个十字路口摆八字摊的算命先生也“请”去当连长了。胡匪宗南也匆忙从川西北赶调队伍由成渝公路向重庆增援，可是当胡匪军进抵永川时，重庆已解放了。反动派一切的妄想破灭了，他们开始慌乱狼狈地溃窜了。成渝公路、涪江沿岸以及一切可以通往成都的大道拥塞了溃退的卡车与兵士。队伍中有许多是拉来的民夫，替他们肩挑着掠夺的财物。还有穿着入时的舞女型人物、猴子、洋狗，组成一支混乱的行列。
    这些贪婪无耻的匪徒们，在覆亡前仍不放松一分钟的时间去掠夺财物。他们踢开香烟店、糖果铺的大门，大批地抓着物品；他们在百货店里抢着皮鞋、胶鞋；在合川县（嘉陵江、渠江与涪江汇流地），冠生园的大曲酒数百瓶，罐头数十打被抢了；棉纱、水糖、盐巴、菜油、香烟、电料、手饰、衣物无一幸免。自贡市伪戒严司令卿云灿，在逃跑前，从伪中央银行搜括了五千元装成一箱的银元十二箱，用军服掩护以大卡车运送威远。十二月五日，人民解放军从富顺县邓井关进迫自贡时，他还令伪市长甘绩丕替他立筹银元十万，后因时间紧迫，使他“失望地”逃走了。遂宁是伪十二专署所在地，伪专员李泽民搜括了八口装满金银细软的大皮箱，和他的太太坐上小轿车，“女子玉帛俱满载”地逃之夭夭了。这就是匪徒们的本领。他们还有一项本领就是能使解放军追得喘不过气来。在铜梁县的巴江餐旅馆，有几十个匪军订好了菜饭，准备吃顿饱饭逃跑，可是当碗筷摆好时，听说解放军追来了，撒腿就跑。正在理发的匪首杨森（他从重庆狼狈逃到铜梁）刚剪完头，也顾不得洗发修面，坐上吉普车就跑。十二月二日黄昏，杨匪逃到潼南，潼南伪政府摆好筵席准备欢宴这位“重庆市长”，杨匪的吉普车到了，但他没有赴筵，惊慌失措地从车上跳下，叫上他的参谋长赶快逃走。一个国民党的兵士，当老百姓询问他解放军如何时，他说：“解放军什么样子，我们都没有看见过。”十二月二十七日，解放军在成都插起胜利的旗帜时，四川的匪徒们全部覆灭了。
    随着蒋匪的覆灭，人民从躲藏的地方走向街头，带着欢笑，迎接解放军。十二月的四川虽是严冬，然而四川人民的内心却像是阳光明媚的春天。在长江两岸，在嘉陵江畔，在一切的大小城市，到处在举行着盛大的欢迎、庆祝、游行。所有这些场合，几乎都是锣鼓喧天，解放的歌声到处飘扬，人民的秧歌舞在尽情扭着，人们高声的喊出他们许久积压在心中的话，毛主席、朱总司令的画像永远是被大家簇拥着前进。庄严的五星国旗——胜利的旗帜在四川凌空飞舞。人民的时代来了。
    嘉陵江畔风景幽美的北碚，十二月二日解放。当扩音机播送出激昂的“义勇军进行曲”时，人如潮水涌向街头。他们欢呼着：“毛主席万岁！”“中国共产党万岁！”“中华人民共和国万岁！”十八日举行了两万余人的盛大游行。女师学院附中的漫画上，画着一个从山边徐徐上升的太阳，光芒普照大地，画上写着：“天，真的亮了！”在重庆附近的巴县，糖食铺的老板，香烟摊的伙计，要把他们的糖食、香烟送给解放军吃，解放军的战士们，婉言相谢，用人民币公平购买。沿着涪江的合川、潼南、遂宁，均在十二月上旬解放。遂宁县在解放军到达的前一天，人民即争相打扫街道，洗刷墙壁上蒋匪留下来的欺骗人民的标语。合川的学生们组织了“青年工作队”进行宣传。店员在店铺中学着“三退一”的秧歌步伐，连过去怕羞的姑娘也狂欢地扭着秧歌走向街头。
    在长江上游的江津、白沙、泸县，人民迎接着自己的队伍。泸县二十三兵工厂的工人们，在对岸泰安乡的枪炮一停，他们立刻派出本厂两艘木船渡江去迎接解放军，并把暗地作好的五星红旗插在岸边。在解放前，他们为了防止匪帮的破坏，取出库存的枪枝武装起来，并准备了氯气硝酸、火炮，以便必要时伪装破坏。白沙的农民，拿着庆祝解放的红绿旗，牵牛荷锄，参加游行。江津县当戴着红星帽徽的解放军出现时，欢迎的红灯燃遍了全城。
    以产盐著名的盐都自贡市，是在一个夜里解放的。当信号弹明亮地升空而起时，如雷似的欢迎声震撼了天空。大家从窗口中伸出头来探望、鼓掌、欢呼，有的人流着欢喜的泪。休息在福华茶社门前的解放军，被争着攀谈的人们紧紧地围拢着。一些好奇的小孩偷偷地抚摸着解放军的手，看是否长着红毛，因为蒋匪曾经造过这样的谣言。十六日，自贡召开军民联欢大会，两万多人一起唱着：“起来！不愿做奴隶的人们！……”在成渝公路的孔道、川糖产地的内江，人民以珍贵的礼物，该地特产甘蔗、食糖两千余斤，赠送给解放军。
    十二月的欢欣，不仅是在交通大道与沿江城镇，在成渝路与嘉陵江之间的大足，只去了解放军的一位指导员（他是去成立县人民政府办事处的），期待久了的人民立即狂欢起来，爆竹和欢呼声响遍全城，学生们当即拿着旗子，扭着秧歌游行起来。他们在解放前即一面上课，一面偷偷的练习秧歌舞。被家长硬接回去的学生，含着满眶热泪；有些女同学的行李被搬回去了，但人还是留在学校里不回去。廿五日，铜梁县在雾雨蒙蒙中举行了两万人的庆祝大会与游行。虽然天气阴沉，道路泥泞，然而阻不住人民庆祝解放的火热的心情。深夜，城中仍被庆祝的灯火照得通红一片，歌声飘荡：“……向着自由，向着太阳，向着新中国发出万丈的光芒！”
