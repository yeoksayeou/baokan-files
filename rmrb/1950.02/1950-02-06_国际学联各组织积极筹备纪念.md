Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, February 5th (Telegraph Agency of the Soviet Union, Prague dispatch): Organizations affiliated with the International Union of Students (IUS) are actively preparing to hold "Day of Struggle Against Colonialism" (formerly translated as "Colonial Youth Solidarity Day") – February 21st.

　　The IUS plans to make this day the greatest demonstration of youth fighting for national independence. It has prepared slogans, wall posters, and pamphlets describing the struggles of students in colonial and dependent countries, and will publish a true record of the educational situation in colonial countries.

　　Radio Prague will broadcast special programs on February 13th and 20th about the significance of the February 21st movement and the educational situation in colonial countries. The radio station will also broadcast messages to colonial students and letters from colonial students.

　　The Chairman of the Dutch General Youth League, Bakker, has sent a letter to Indonesian youth for February 21st, vowing that Dutch youth will fight for the return of all Dutch recruits sent to Indonesia, and promising to provide more effective support for the struggle of Indonesian youth. The letter also stated that Dutch youth are not deceived by the false promises of the Dutch government, and praised those Dutch soldiers who refused to fight against the Indonesian people and suffered abuse for their heroic defiance in prison.

　　French youth are supporting the growing movement of French workers who refuse to produce, load, or transport war materials to Vietnam, and are preparing thousands of demonstrations and activities, including organizing several delegations of hundreds of people, to submit resolutions opposing the war to the French government authorities for the "Day of Struggle Against Colonialism".

　　Youth in Austria, the Communist Youth League of Argentina, the Revolutionary Youth League of Costa Rica, and youth in many other countries also plan to hold similar demonstrations.
