　　How to Remold Intellectuals in the Land Reform?
　　Jin Feng
    Since last December, eight hundred professors and students from Beijing have gone to the countryside to participate in the land reform work in the suburbs of Beijing. In the land reform movement of hundreds of thousands of peasants, they have tempered their proletarian stance and consolidated the revolutionary theoretical knowledge they have gained in the year since liberation. At the same time, their participation in the land reform work has changed the face of the cadre force in the land reform in the suburbs of Beijing (their number is twice the original number of cadres), thus shortening the time for land reform and enabling the land reform in the suburbs of Beijing to be completed before the spring plowing in March. This proves that for intellectuals in schools in newly liberated areas, after political enlightenment education, appropriately organizing them to participate in land reform work without hindering regular classes can more effectively remold their thinking and partially solve the difficulty of lacking cadres in the new areas.
    (1) Breaking Through the First Barrier of Going to the Countryside—How to Approach Peasants
    Most of the professors and students who went to the countryside had a high degree of enthusiasm for learning from workers and peasants and transforming themselves in their work. However, they were not familiar with the countryside, did not understand the methods of rural work, and did not know how to approach peasants. As a result, some students were "speechless" after saying a few words to peasants during visits; some students enthusiastically lectured peasants on class division, giving two-hour lectures on "means of production," "ownership relations," and "production relations," but the peasants could not understand at all. Therefore, correctly solving the problem of their approach to peasants has become the key to opening up the work situation.
    This mainly depends on the concrete help of veteran cadres. Some of the work team leaders in the land reform in the suburbs of Beijing successfully adopted the following steps: (1) Taking them to participate in various large and small rural meetings as apprentices; such as participating in village meetings to enable them to understand the various components of the countryside; such as participating in peasant representative meetings or farmers' association cadre meetings to familiarize them with activists in the countryside; such as participating in farmers' association member meetings to make them aware of the basic masses in the countryside—poor, hired, and middle peasants; through these meetings, they gradually understood and became familiar with the faces of various peasants in the countryside. And they learned how to control the meeting and how to lead the peasant masses to struggle against the landlords; enabling them to quickly enter the work, and become familiar with and close to the peasants through work. (2) The work team leader patiently told them the characteristics of the peasants, and told them the main points to pay attention to when visiting the peasants. Before they went alone to take charge of a small group meeting, the work team leader first talked to them about the method of leading the small group meeting, and prepared some examples of local landlords' oppression and exploitation of peasants needed when talking to the peasants, so that they could use this as a basis to educate the peasants, to guide the peasants to pour out their grievances, to help the peasants calculate their poverty and dig out the roots of poverty in order to enlighten the peasants' class consciousness. (3) The work team leader and them insisted on studying for two hours every day. When studying, combined with the land reform situation in the village, they studied the land reform policy together, and used local concrete examples to illustrate issues such as class division, fighting local bullies, and dividing the fruits. The result of doing so effectively helped them shorten the process of combining theory with practice, and improved their ability to approach the peasants and solve problems for the peasants.
    (2) Tempering the Class Stand
    Since most of the intellectuals who went to the countryside were of petty-bourgeois origin, they had long been separated from the production process, and in practice, most of them had neither exploited others nor suffered feudal exploitation. Therefore, they only had empty hatred for the landlords, and this hatred often became blurred when encountering practical problems. They often sympathized with the peasants and hated the landlords when they saw the peasants pouring out their grievances; when they saw the landlords' feigned cries, they did not know that this was a means for the landlords to attack the peasants and instead sympathized with the landlords. Therefore, tempering their class stand through land reform is the central link in their ideological transformation in the countryside.
    First, class education is carried out through work such as pouring out grievances, accusations, fighting local bullies, dividing classes, and establishing Party and League organizations. For example, the students in the Xihongmen work team learned at the peasants' grievance meeting that the local bully landlord Liu Zicheng lent a peasant three dan of soybeans, and within three years, the peasant had returned twenty dan of wheat and had not yet paid off twelve dan of corn; the students of the Xizhihe work team in the Fourteenth District also learned from the peasants' grievances that a landlord named Ma hired long-term workers to farm the land during the enemy and puppet regime, not only did not pay wages, but also required the long-term workers to pay him two mao for meals every day. From these practical examples, the students learned about the various ghostly tricks of the landlords in exploiting the peasants and the catastrophic cruelty of exploitation. For example, at a 3,000-person rally in Xihongmen to accuse and fight local bully Chen Zibin, Liu Zicheng, and others, thirty or forty peasants wept and stamped their feet, accusing the bullies Chen Zibin, Liu Zicheng, and others of burying good people alive, establishing private courts, torturing peasants, and seizing women, etc. Xu Beihong and the students present at the scene cried with grief and indignation, enhancing their hatred for the landlord class. When dividing classes, the students and professors conscientiously controlled the meeting, and together with the peasants, calculated the figures of the landlords' and rich peasants' exploitation and possession, thus recognizing the irreconcilable and sharp class opposition between the rich and poor peasants, and eliminating their super-class fantasies. And the landlords' various cunning and rogue destructive behaviors in land reform, such as concealing black land, dispersing grain, destroying farm tools, and demolishing houses, further increased their understanding of the class nature of the landlords.
    Secondly, veteran cadres in the work team used their years of rich struggle experience and clear class stand to help correct the vagueness and wavering in the positions of these intellectuals at any time in their work. For example, a Peking University student in the Da Jiaoting work team in the Thirteenth District saw the rich peasant crying "pitifully" at a class division meeting, and he also cried, causing temporary chaos at the meeting. Later, the veteran cadre publicly exposed the rich peasant's trick of acting shamelessly, reversed the mood of the masses, and also made the student realize the wavering of his own position.
    (3) Leadership, Organization, and Use Issues
    Finally, to promote the participation of intellectuals who go to the countryside in land reform and transform their thinking in their work, it is also necessary for the school and the CPC Suburban Committee, the District Committee, and the work team leader to correctly lead, organize, and use them.
    First, the school should do a good job in ideological preparation and organizational preparation. Some school teachers and students organized themselves according to their political level and voluntary principle before going to the countryside to study the land reform policy, and also did a very thorough ideological review work. Most of the teachers and students were prepared to go to the countryside to serve the peasants honestly, endure hardships and stand hard work, and learn from the peasants and veteran cadres with an open mind. They also earnestly abide by the principle of grouping, so each group had appropriate activists and Party and League members as the backbone. After going to the countryside, these backbones cooperated with the veteran cadres of the work team to help the students and teachers work peacefully and earnestly carry out ideological transformation. However, individual schools mobilized the teachers and students of the school to go to the countryside in a formalistic way, so that some teachers and students went to the countryside with the simple purpose of "experiencing life" and "learning," thus forming "observing life" or "watching the work," failing to work well and failing to transform their thinking well.
    Second, the District Committee and the school jointly lead and divide responsibilities. Since most of the veteran cadres in the district and work team did not have experience in transforming intellectuals, it was necessary to obtain the cooperation of the school in using the intellectuals who went to the countryside. This was carried out in the following way: A central group, also known as a district team or land reform brigade, was established for the teachers and students of each school participating in a certain administrative district to uniformly grasp the ideological situation of the teachers and students in the land reform. The head of the central group attended the joint meeting of the heads of the land reform work teams convened by the district committee secretary, and cooperated with the district committee to timely correct and prevent many ideological and work deviations of the teachers and students who went to the countryside in the land reform. At the same time, one of the teachers and students participating in the work team served as the deputy head of the work team, and helped the original head to jointly lead the work of the group under the unified leadership of the District Committee and the head of the Central Group.
    Third, the work team leader adopted the method of bold use and close inspection. Most of the work team leaders tried their best to solicit and respect the opinions of the professors and students, jointly formulate the work plan of the work team with them, form decisions, and let them go to carry them out separately, and let them take charge of a small group or the work of a village alone as much as possible. On the one hand, a strict meeting and reporting system was established to check in a timely manner, and any errors that occurred were corrected at any time, and then they were allowed to correct them in their work. This can not only give full play to their creativity and enthusiasm, but also help them effectively transform their thinking in strict practical work. Some group leaders are not good at using them and helping them, and are unwilling to let go of their work, and are so busy that the intellectuals who participate in the work feel that they have nothing to do, so that they become emotional.
    Fourth, the work team leader and other veteran cadres in the group at any time use their clear class stand, mass line working methods, and hard and simple lifestyle to enlighten and educate the professors and students participating in the land reform. For example, when Xihongmen work team leader Hu Ziran held a work team meeting, he first made full preparations, put forward certain opinions, guided the group members to discuss and concentrated everyone's opinions to form the work team's plan, and made it become an action in the land reform. The professors and students in his group learned to use his work method to convene peasant meetings, and also cultivated the working ability of peasant cadres. At the same time, Hu Ziran's concern for the peasants and his clear class boundaries with the landlords, as well as his selfless spirit of resolutely breaking away from production to engage in revolutionary work regardless of the difficulties in his family life, made the professors and students in his group unanimously call him a living textbook for their class education.

　　如何在土改中改造知识分子？
　　金凤
    北京市八百教授学生自去年十二月起陆续下乡参加京郊土改工作。他们在数十万农民的翻身运动中，锻炼了无产阶级立场，巩固了解放一年来所获得的革命理论知识。同时由于他们的参加土改工作，改变了京郊土改干部的力量配备的面貌（他们的人数为原有干部的一倍），因而缩短了土改进行的时间，使京郊土改能于三月春耕以前全部完成。这证明了对于新解放区学校知识分子在进行了政治启发教育以后，在不妨碍正课教学的条件下，适当地组织他们参加土改工作，是能更有效地改造他们的思想，并可以部分解决新区干部缺乏的困难。
    （一）突破下乡第一关—如何接近农民
    大部分下乡的教授学生都有向工农学习、在工作中改造自己的高度热情。但他们不熟悉农村，不懂得农村工作的方法，不知道如何接近农民。这样，有的学生在访问农民时，和农民说了几句话以后就“相对无言”了；有的学生很热心地给农民讲划阶级，讲了两个钟头的“生产资料”、“占有关系”和“生产关系”，结果农民一点也听不懂。因此，正确地解决他们与农民接近的问题，就成为打开工作局面的关键。
    这主要有赖于老干部的具体帮助。京郊土改中的一部分工作组长是成功地采取了这样一些步骤：（一）带他们参加农村的各种大小会议作为见习；如参加村民大会使他们了解农村各种组成分子；如参加农民代表会议或农会干部会议使他们熟悉农村中的积极分子；如参加农会会员大会使他们认识农村中的基本群众—贫雇中农；通过这种种会议使他们逐渐了解和熟悉农村中各种农民的面貌。并学习了如何掌握会场和如何领导农民群众向地主进行斗争的工作方法；使他们很快地进入工作，通过工作和农民熟悉和接近起来。（二）工作组长耐心地告诉他们农民的特点，告诉他们访问农民时所须注意的要点。在他们单独去掌握一个小组会以前，工作组长先和他们谈一谈领导小组会的方法，为他们准备一些和农民谈话时所需要的当地地主压迫、剥削农民的事例，使他们可以以此为根据去教育农民，去引导农民诉苦，去帮助农民算穷帐和挖穷根以启发农民的阶级觉悟。（三）工作组长和他们一起坚持每天两小时的学习。学习时结合本村土改情况，与他们共同学习土改政策，以本地的具体事例来说明划阶级、斗争恶霸、分果实等问题。这样做的结果极有效地帮助他们缩短了理论与实际结合的过程，提高了他们与农民接近为农民解决问题的能力。
    （二）阶级立场的锻炼
    由于这批下乡的知识分子多半是小资产阶级成份，他们长期脱离生产过程，在实际上多半是既未剥削过人也未遭受过封建性的剥削。因此他们对于地主只有空洞的仇恨，而这种仇恨碰到实际问题往往模糊起来。他们常常是看到农民诉苦就同情农民，仇恨地主；看到地主假意的哭叫，不知道这是地主进攻农民的手段而又同情地主起来。因此，通过土改锻炼他们的阶级立场，是他们下乡改造思想的中心环节。
    首先是通过诉苦、控诉和斗争恶霸、划阶级、建党建团等工作来进行阶级教育。如西红门工作组中的同学在农民诉苦会上，知道本村恶霸地主刘子成借给一个农民三石黄豆，三年内，那个农民还了他二十石麦子，十二石棒子还没有还清；十四区西直河工作组的同学也从农民的诉苦中知道一家姓马的地主，在敌伪时雇了长工种地，不仅不给工钱，每天还要长工倒贴他两毛饭钱。同学们从这些实际例子知道地主剥削农民的种种鬼蜮伎俩和剥削的灾难性的残酷。又如在西红门的一个控诉斗争恶霸的三千人的大会上，三四十个农民涕泪交流、顿足捶胸地控诉恶霸陈子彬、刘子成等活埋善良的老百姓，私立公堂，拷打农民，霸占妇女等等的血泪事实，在场的徐悲鸿教授和同学们都悲愤填膺地哭了起来，增强了对于地主阶级的仇恨。在划阶级的时候，同学和教授们认真地掌握会场，和农民一起计算着地主、富农剥削、占有的数字，由此认清了地富和贫雇农的不可调和的尖锐的阶级对立，消灭了他们的超阶级的幻想。而土改中地主的隐瞒黑地，分散粮食，毁坏农具，拉倒房屋等种种狡诈无赖的破坏行为，更使他们增加了对于地主的阶级本性的了解。
    其次，工作组中老干部以其多年丰富的斗争经验和明确的阶级立场，随时在工作中帮助矫正了这些知识分子立场上的模糊和动摇。如十三区大郊亭北大同学在一个划阶级会上，看到富农哭得“可怜”，他也就跟着哭了，一时会场混乱起来，后经老干部当众揭发了富农撒赖的诡计，扭转了群众情绪，同时也使这个同学认识到自己立场的动摇。
    （三）领导、组织和使用问题
    最后，推动下乡知识分子参加土改并在工作中改造思想，还须要学校和中共郊委、区委和工作组长对于他们的正确领导、组织和使用。
    第一，学校方面做好充分的思想准备与组织准备的工作。有些学校师生在下乡前按政治水平及自觉自愿的原则组织起来学习了土改政策，又做了很周密的思想检查工作。大部分师生都准备下乡老老实实为农民服务，吃苦耐劳，虚心向农民和老干部学习。他们并都切实遵守分组的原则，因此每组有了适当的积极分子和党团员作为骨干。下乡后这些骨干配合了工作组的老干部帮助同学师长安心地工作和切实地进行思想改造。而个别学校形式主义地动员该校师生下乡，以致部分师生下乡时单纯抱着“为体验生活”和“为学习”的目的，因而下乡后形成“观察生活”或“旁观工作”，没有很好地工作也不能很好地改造思想。
    第二，区委会与学校双方集体领导，分工负责。由于区上及工作组中的老干部多半没有专门从事于改造知识分子的经验，因此在使用下乡的知识分子方面，取得学校方面的合作就成为必要的了。这是采取了下列的方式来进行的：参加到某一行政区的每一个学校的下乡师生都成立了一个中心组或称区队或土改大队，统一掌握该校师生在土改中的思想情况。中心组长参加区委书记召集的土改工作组长联席会议，配合区委及时纠正并防止了下乡的师生在土改中很多思想上及工作上的偏向。同时参加工作组的师生中的一个充当工作组的副组长，在区委与中心组长的统一领导下帮助原组长共同领导该组的工作。
    第三，工作组长采取了大胆使用，抓紧检查的方法。大部分工作组长都尽量征求并尊重教授学生的意见，与他们共同制订工作组的工作计划，形成决定，放手使用他们去分头执行，尽可能让他们单独去掌握一个片儿小组或一个村的工作。一面又建立严格的会议和汇报制度，及时检查，对发生的错误随时提出纠正，再让他们在工作中去改正。这样既能充分发扬他们的创造性和积极性，并可以在严格的现实工作中来帮助他们切实改造思想。有些小组长还不善于这样很好地使用他们和帮助他们，工作上不肯放手，自己忙得要命，而参加工作的知识分子却觉得无事可干，以致闹起情绪来。
    第四，工作组长及组内其他老干部随时以自己明确的阶级立场、群众路线的工作方法以及艰苦朴实的生活作风来启发和教育参加土改的教授学生。如西红门工作组长胡自然在开工作组会议时，自己先作充分的准备，提出一定的意见，引导组员讨论后集中大家的意见，形成工作组的计划，并使之变为土改中的行动。在他组中的教授同学即学习运用他这种工作方法去召开农民会议，并也由此培养了农民干部的工作能力。同时，胡自然对于农民的体贴关心与对于地主的显明的阶级界限以及他的不顾家中生活困难坚决脱离生产从事革命工作的大公无私的精神，使得他组中的教授同学异口同声地称他为他们的阶级教育的活课本。
