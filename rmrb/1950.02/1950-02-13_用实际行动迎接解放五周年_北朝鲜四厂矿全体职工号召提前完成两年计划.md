Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, February 12th: The workers, technicians, and staff of four factories and mines in Hamgyongnam-do, North Korea, who have repeatedly achieved victories on the production front, namely the Hungnam Fertilizer Factory, the Bongoong Chemical Factory, the Donchon Coal Mine, and the Hamhung Railway Administration, voluntarily proposed in mid-January to mark this year's August 15th, the fifth anniversary of liberation, with practical actions to complete the two-year economic plan ahead of schedule. This proposal received the active encouragement and support of the Party, administrative departments, and trade unions of the respective factories and mines, and a warm discussion and deliberation was carried out among all the workers. At the end of January, the four factories and mines respectively held general meetings of all employees. At the meetings, the workers unanimously passed resolutions to strive to complete the two-year economic plan before August 15th of this year, and resolved to jointly issue a letter to all workers in North Korea, calling on all workers, technicians, and staff in North Korea to work together to strive for the early completion of the two-year plan. In addition to guaranteeing that the four factories and mines will complete the tasks stipulated in the two-year plan before August 15th, the letter to workers also put forward the goals of exceeding the plan and reducing costs before the end of the year. The result of the production competition among the four factories and mines will reduce the total cost by more than 182 million won (calculated at 23 yuan RMB per Korean won) and increase the total wealth by more than 2.27 billion won.

The Central Committee of the Korean Workers' Party and the Cabinet Council highly praised the patriotic actions of the workers of the four factories and mines, and have separately instructed Party and government organs and organizations at all levels to make every effort to support and guarantee the successful implementation of their plans, and to promote this movement to all workers in North Korea.
