　　Henan Cattle Plague Basically Eliminated
    Thousands of Sick Animals Cured, 160,000 Cattle and Horses Vaccinated.
    [Report from this newspaper] The cattle plague that occurred in Henan Province has been basically eradicated. In December of last year, cattle plague was successively discovered in the Huaiyang, Nanyang, and Shanzhou special districts of the province. The Veterinary College of the Health Department of the Central Military Commission was ordered to dispatch 48 technical cadres and students from its Veterinary Disease Prevention and Control Experiment Center, forming a veterinary disease prevention and control team. They carried 800,000 cc of anthrax vaccine and serum and rushed to the epidemic area on December 22 last year to carry out prevention and control work. More than 100 students from Henan Agricultural School and Henan University also went to the epidemic area with the team to work and study. They vaccinated 160,000 cattle and horses and cured nearly 1,000 sick animals. Currently, except for gas gangrene (due to not carrying medicine to treat this disease), all other anthrax has been eradicated in the province. The prevention and control team was warmly welcomed by the people of Henan, who presented them with various kinds of brocade banners upon their departure. The team returned to the school on the 7th of this month.

　　豫牛疫基本消灭
    治愈病畜千头，注射牛马十六万头。
    【本报讯】河南省境内发生的牛疫已基本上扑灭。该省淮阳、南阳、陕州等专区，去年十二月间相继发现牛疫。中央军委卫生部兽医学院奉命调派所属兽疫防治实验处技术干部及防疫班学生四十八人，组成兽疫防治队，携带炭疽疫苗及血清八十万西西，于去年十二月二十二日驰往疫区进行防治工作。河南农校及河南大学同学百余人亦随队前往疫区工作学习，前后注射牛马十六万头，治愈病畜将近千头。现该省除气肿疽病外（因未带治此病药品），其余炭疽已全部扑灭。防治队得到了河南人民的热烈欢迎，临别时赠送各色各样的锦旗。该队已于本月七日返校。
