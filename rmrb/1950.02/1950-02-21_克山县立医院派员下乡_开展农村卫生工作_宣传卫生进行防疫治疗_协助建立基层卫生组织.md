　　Keshan County Hospital Sends Personnel to the Countryside
　　Conducting Rural Health Work
　　Publicize Hygiene, Conduct Epidemic Prevention and Treatment, Assist in Establishing Grassroots Health Organizations
　　[From Our Newspaper] The Keshan County Hospital in Heilongjiang Province has dispatched some medical personnel to the countryside on a rotating basis to carry out epidemic prevention, treatment, health publicity, and other work, and to assist in establishing grassroots organizations for rural health work. Preliminary results and experiences have been gained over the past year.
　　Last year, the hospital's medical personnel made a total of 48 trips to the countryside (11 for health publicity, 37 for epidemic prevention and treatment), totaling 346 working days. A total of more than 500 patients with measles, enteritis, and dysentery in children (other diseases not included in the statistics) were cured; vaccinations were given to more than 9,000 people; and cholera vaccines were injected into more than 8,000 people. Hygiene management committees were assisted in establishing in 120 villages, hygiene committee members and hygiene group leaders were elected, hygiene covenants were formulated, and a hygiene inspection system was implemented. The methods of preventing the local endemic disease - Keshan disease - were also widely publicized.
　　Through the influence of health publicity and practical medical effects, the peasants' understanding of scientific medicine and hygiene has been generally improved, breaking down superstitious ideas. For example, in the spring of last year, many children in the central village of Binhe District suffered from measles, complicated with pneumonia and enteritis. At first, the masses believed in witch doctors and used superstitious methods for treatment, which had no effect, and more than a dozen people died. Later, the hospital staff arrived and cured all the sick children. Serious spring measles and pneumonia also occurred in Beixing District. After eight days and nights of emergency treatment by doctors sent by the hospital, all were cured. Therefore, the hospital staff established prestige among the peasants. They explained the source of the disease to the peasants, exposed the tricks of the witch doctors, and asked everyone to pay attention to hygiene, which the masses believed very much. For example, after listening to the health publicity from the hospital staff, the masses in Rongjiawobao Village, Beilian District, buried the diseased horse meat that they were preparing to eat. After listening to the publicity about the prevention of "Keshan disease," farmers in many villages realized the relationship between Keshan disease and the living environment. Under the promotion of the village health organizations and the hospital's rural staff, they all built toilets, plastered kang beds, and repaired chimneys to improve their houses; Xinli Village in Hebei District also plans to go to the mountains to collect wood in conjunction with winter sideline production in preparation for rebuilding houses. At the same time, all districts took the initiative to request the county to send Western doctors to establish clinics, and they were willing to raise funds themselves.
　　The experiences in opening up rural health work over the past year are as follows:
　　(1) The rural work of medical personnel must be closely linked with the administration, and at the same time, the thinking of district and village cadres must be straightened out so that they realize the importance of health work. Through them, the driving force is great. However, at present, many cadres and the masses only care about production and do not pay attention to health work. It is best to use detailed accounting methods to calculate the losses caused by an epidemic; how much labor and material resources are wasted by one person getting sick, etc., to explain the impact of health work on production, in order to arouse their attention.
　　(2) Rural medical workers should have a hard-working and simple style, be good at approaching the masses, patiently explain problems, speak the language of the masses, and not put on airs. Experience has proven that influencing the masses through labor is the best method of propaganda and education. Some medical workers personally nursed patients in the countryside, and rushed to rescue them day and night in emergencies regardless of the weather. Therefore, they gained the trust of the masses and made the work proceed smoothly. When publicizing Keshan disease prevention, many propagandists personally went to the homes of farmers to help build toilets, plaster kang beds, and repair chimneys, which made many unenthusiastic people also start to improve their housing.
　　(3) Propaganda to the masses should use practical examples, and empty theories are less effective. Pay attention to grasping the superstitious ideas existing among the masses, and raise questions against this kind of thinking to give patient explanations in order to break superstitious concepts.
　　(4) Mobilizing the active elements in the masses who pay attention to hygiene to make them play a backbone role, and praising the good ones more and criticizing those who do not pay attention to hygiene at meetings is also very effective.
　　(5) Using students for health publicity is a relatively effective method. Because students are easy to accept scientific health knowledge and can play a role in the family. In the winter before last year, when publicizing the prevention of Keshan disease, several simple songs were compiled, putting the causes, symptoms, treatment, and prevention methods of Keshan disease into them, and taught them to rural students. They were all willing to learn, and the effect was very good.

　　克山县立医院派员下乡
    开展农村卫生工作
    宣传卫生进行防疫治疗  协助建立基层卫生组织
    【本报讯】黑龙江省克山县县立医院派出一部分医务人员，轮流赴农村进行防疫、治疗、卫生宣传等工作，并协助建立农村卫生工作基层组织，一年来已获得初步成绩和经验。
    该院医务人员去年共下乡四十八次（卫生宣传十一次、防疫治疗三十七次）计三百四十六个工作日。共治好小儿麻疹、肠炎、赤痢（其他疾病未统计在内）患者五百余名；种痘约九千多人；霍乱疫苗注射八千多人。协助一百二十个村建立了卫生管理委员会，选举了卫生委员、卫生组长，订立了卫生公约和实行卫生检查制度。并广泛宣传了预防当地地方病——克山病—的预防方法。
    通过卫生宣传与实际医疗效果的影响，农民对科学的医药卫生的认识已普遍提高，打破了迷信思想。如去年春季滨河区中心村小儿患麻疹、合并肺炎、肠炎的很多。起初群众相信巫医，以迷信方法治疗，没有效果，死亡十余人。后来医院人员赶到，把病的小孩都治好了。北兴区也发生严重的春季麻疹和肺炎，经医院派出的医生抢治八昼夜，全部治好了。因此医院人员在农民中树立了威信。他们向农民宣传解释病源，揭破巫医的骗术，要大家讲求卫生，群众都很相信。如北联区荣家窝堡村群众听了医院人员的卫生宣传以后，把准备吃的病尸马肉埋掉。许多村庄的农民听了关于预防“克山病”的宣传以后，认识了克山病与生活环境的关系，在村卫生组织与医院下乡工作人员的推动下，都修厕所、抹炕、修烟筒等以改良屋子；河北区新立村并计划结合冬季副业生产上山采木头，准备改建房子。同时，各区都主动地要求县方给派西医成立医务所，他们愿意自己筹措经费。
    一年来开辟农村卫生工作中的经验，有如下几点：
    （一）医务人员下乡工作必须和行政上取得密切联系，同时打通区村干部思想，使他们认识到卫生工作的重要性，通过他们，推动力量大。但目前有不少干部和群众只管搞生产，不重视卫生工作。对他们最好用算细账的办法，计算一次传染病流行所引起的损失；病了一个人要浪费多少劳力和物力等，说明卫生工作对生产的影响，以引起其重视。
    （二）下乡医务工作者，要有艰苦朴素的作风，善于接近群众，耐心解释问题，说大众话，不拿架子。经验证明，以劳动来影响群众是最好的宣传教育方法。有的医务工作者在下乡中亲自护理病人，遇到紧急病况时不分昼夜风雨前往抢救。因此，取得了群众的信任，使工作进行顺利。在作克山病预防宣传时，许多宣传员亲自到农民家去帮助修厕所、抹炕、修烟筒，使许多不积极的群众也动手去改进自己的住房了。
    （三）向群众宣传，要用实际例子，空头理论收效较小。要注意抓住群众存在的迷信思想，针对这种思想提出问题给以耐心的解释，以打破迷信观念。
    （四）发动群众中讲求卫生的积极分子，使他们起骨干作用，并在开会时多表扬好的，批评不讲求卫生的，这样也很有效。
    （五）利用学生作卫生宣传，是比较有效的一个方法。因为学生容易接受科学的卫生知识，能在家庭起作用。前年冬季宣传预防克山病时，编成了几个简单的歌子，把得克山病的原因、症状、疗法、预防方法编进去，教给农村的学生。他们都愿意学，收的效果也很好。
