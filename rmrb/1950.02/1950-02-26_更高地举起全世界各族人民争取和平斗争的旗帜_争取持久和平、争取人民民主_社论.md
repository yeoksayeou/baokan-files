Xinhua News Agency, Prague, February 24th: The February 10th issue of "For Lasting Peace, For People's Democracy" published an editorial entitled "Raise Higher the Banner of the World's People's Struggle for Peace," the full text of which is as follows:

The people of all nations do not want war. They abhor war and are opposing it. They demand a solid and lasting peace. They resolutely advocate curbing the mad warmongers. The masses of the people are increasingly aware that the imperialists are trying to plunge them into a terrible abyss. The call of the Communist Parties of all countries to fight for peace has won such warm support from the broad masses of the people of all countries precisely because it represents the thoughts and desires of the people of all countries; precisely because it conforms to the urgent and vital interests of all progressive mankind.

The Communist Parties of all countries have played a leading role in this struggle for peace. They are the initiators of the powerful movement for peace and give it the necessary impetus and organization. Regardless of race, nationality, political thought, and religious belief, they have and continue to attract all progressive and democratic organizations, all true democrats and patriots, and attract millions of women and young people into the struggle for peace.

In this way, in an unprecedentedly short period of time, for the first time in human history, an organized front of peace supporters has emerged, led by the Soviet Union—the pillar and standard-bearer of world peace.

Today, the American imperialists and the governments of the Marshallized countries no longer complacently believe they have crushed "Communist propaganda." They are furious because they have encountered the organized strength of the broad masses of the people on the road to preparing for a new war. In the United States, India, France, Italy, the United Kingdom, Syria, and the Netherlands, the governments of these countries use police repression to crack down on peace advocates, and use their watchdogs—fascist cronies, Labor Party lackeys, and other right-wing socialist lackeys of imperialism—to deal with them.

In the years of the anti-fascist war, when Hitler's atrocities not only did not break the fighting spirit of the people's avengers, guerrillas, and light infantry, but instead ignited an even greater flame of struggle against fascist aggression throughout the world, that was the experience. And today, the situation will be the same. Truman and his followers in the Marshallized countries will never be able to pave the way for another war with their police provocations and repressions. The struggle of the masses of the people for peace is growing into a new and higher stage, transforming into concrete patriotic actions against war.

The working class in the capitalist countries, at the initiative of the French working people, has become increasingly determined to refuse to manufacture weapons of murder. Dockworkers, sailors, and railway workers in France, Italy, Belgium, and the Netherlands are refusing to unload American military equipment. In France, the surging wave of popular anger against the "despicable and filthy war" in Vietnam is growing, and the masses of the people resolutely demand the withdrawal of the expeditionary force. In France and Italy, the struggle for peace is merging with the struggle to replace the reactionary governments—puppets of American imperialism—with governments of broad democratic unity. The working people of the Marshallized countries, supporting the call of the Permanent Committee of the World Peace Congress, are now protesting and firmly demanding that the parliaments of those countries stop the arms race, abolish the North Atlantic Treaty and bilateral agreements for the delivery of American military equipment, and actively support the Soviet Union's proposal to ban atomic weapons and other instruments of mass slaughter and conclude a peace pact.

At present, it is not enough to merely issue declarations without engaging in practical actions to be among the ranks of peace supporters. Pacifist prayers cannot prevent war. Only concrete actions can distinguish true peace supporters from politicians who indulge in selling pacifist rhetoric.

The wise, consistent, and uncompromising peace policy pursued by the Soviet Union—the Stalin peace policy—which frustrates the evil schemes of the enemies of peace, is an inspiring example for all progressive mankind.

By laying the foundations of socialism, strengthening national defense, and eliminating the running dogs of the imperialists at home, the working people of the people's democratic countries are making concrete contributions to the cause of peace with their work and political activities.

The great Chinese people, who have freed themselves from the shackles of imperialism and have begun the work of peaceful construction, are building a strong bastion of peace in Asia. The fighters of the national liberation movements in the colonies and dependent countries, undermining the main heartland of imperialism, are strengthening world peace with their heroic struggle for freedom and national independence.

The forces of peace are a mighty army. Their success fills all true peace fighters with confidence in victory. However, in the face of these successes of the democratic camp, the imperialists are becoming increasingly furious and intensifying their insidious plots. The increase in military spending by the countries of the North Atlantic bloc is proof of this plot. The propaganda of new war instigators is becoming more and more rampant.

Truman has again allocated billions of dollars to manufacture atomic weapons. Atomic blackmail is again underway.

The imperialists have signed bilateral agreements to supply Western European countries with American weapons. Obviously, Wall Street is not satisfied with generally enslaving Western Europe, but is striving to tie each Marshallized country individually to the Washington chariot. The work of arming Western European countries, including West Germany, is being intensified; on the other hand, in Asia, secretive conspiracies are also taking place around Bao Dai—an emperor without an empire—and Chiang Kai-shek—a grand marshal without an army. Accompanying the activities of the imperialist politicians are the activities of the army and navy. Vietnam, Indonesia, Malaya, and Burma are bleeding, where the imperialists are trying to use fire and sword to shore up the collapsing foundations of colonial enslavement, but without success. American politicians and generals are harboring and protecting Japanese war criminals who used bacteriological weapons during World War II, because they themselves are preparing to use such weapons.

Under these circumstances, any act that weakens the struggle for peace is a crime. All passive and so-called "war is inevitable" theories, or arguments about "the Soviet Union is a powerful country and will inevitably win anyway," so there is no need for a "peace movement," are nothing more than echoes of imperialist propaganda. The imperialists use every means to weaken the peace movement, causing it to become passive and depressed, thereby paving the way for war. The masses of the people will never forgive any advocate of these so-called theories.

The Communist Parties will ruthlessly expose that anyone who tries to weaken the peace movement is an accomplice of imperialism.

The Communist and Workers' Parties are following the historically significant decisions of the Information Bureau meeting held in Hungary in November 1949. Inspired by the invincible doctrine of Marxism-Leninism, and relying on all the experience of the class struggle in the post-war period, these decisions have shown peace advocates the path to victory: the organizational consolidation and expansion of the peace movement; the active participation of the working class, which has a decisive role; exposing the aggressors and their anti-human propaganda; active concrete actions, giving full support to the initiatives of the masses, and inextricably linking the struggle for peace with the struggle for democratic freedom and national independence, for bread and work, and for the social rights of the working people.

The hopes of the warmongers to weaken the peace front are in vain. The struggle for peace has only just begun. The imperialists should know that if they dare to launch a war, the peace camp will end it with the victory of socialism throughout the world. The experience of the two world wars provides ample proof of this. This can be clearly seen from the unstoppable growth of the democratic and socialist camp.

The defense of the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries against imperialist aggression is the vital cause of the working people of the whole world, because the struggle against war is inseparable from the struggle for democracy and socialism.

In our time, the path of Lenin and Stalin—the path of peace and socialism—is becoming the path of millions of working people around the world. Stalin's thought—Bolshevik thought—is inspiring millions of people and leading them in the struggle for peace. Stalin is the banner of the struggle for peace. Leninism is the infallible compass that points the way to victory.

### 更高地举起全世界各族人民争取和平斗争的旗帜  “争取持久和平、争取人民民主”社论

　　更高地举起全世界各族人民争取和平斗争的旗帜
    “争取持久和平、争取人民民主”社论
    【新华社布拉格二十四日电】二月十日出版的“争取持久和平、争取人民民主”以“更高地举起全世界各族人民争取和平斗争的旗帜”为题，发表社论，全文如下：
    世界各族人民不要战争。他们痛恨战争，并且正在反对战争。他们要求一个巩固的、持久的和平。他们坚决主张遏止发疯的战争贩子。人民群众已愈益认识到帝国主义者在力求把他们投入可怖的深渊中。各国共产党为争取和平而斗争的号召之所以博得了各国广大人民群众如此热烈的支持，正是因为它是代表各国人民所怀抱的思想与愿望；正是因为它符合于全体进步人类迫切的切身利益。
    各国共产党已在这一争取和平的斗争中起了带头作用。它们是强大的拥护和平运动的发起者，并给这一运动以必要的推动和组织。它们不分种族、国籍、政治思想与宗教信仰，已经并且继续把一切进步的、民主的组织，一切真正的民主分子与爱国者吸引到争取和平的斗争中，并把千百万妇女与青年吸引到争取和平的斗争中。
    这样一来，在一个空前短的时间内，人类有史以来第一次出现了一个有组织的拥护和平的阵线，以苏联--世界和平的支柱与旗手--为首的阵线。
    今天，美国帝国主义者和马歇尔化各国的政府，不再认为他们已经粉碎“共产党的宣传活动”而自鸣得意了。他们暴跳如雷，因为他们在准备新战争的道路上遇到了广大人民群众有组织的力量。在美国、印度、法国、意大利、英国、叙利亚和荷兰，这些国家的政府用警察镇压的方法来打击和平拥护者，用看家狗--法西斯伙友、工党仆从及帝国主义的其他右翼社会党仆从来对付他们。
    在反法西斯战争的岁月中，那时，希特勒的暴行不但绝没有打破人民复仇队、游击队与轻装部队的战斗精神，反而掀起了全世界更大的反法西斯侵略的斗争火焰，那时的经验是这样，而今天的情形也将如此，杜鲁门和他在马歇尔化各国中的随从们，绝不能以其警察挑衅与镇压来为另一次战争铺平道路。人民群众争取和平的斗争，正在增长到一个新的、更高的阶段，正在转变成进行具体的爱国行动来反对战争的局面。
    各资本主义国家的工人阶级，在法国劳动人民的倡议之下，已愈来愈加坚决地拒绝制造杀人武器。法、意、比、荷四国的码头工人、海员与铁路员工，正在拒绝卸运美国的军备。在法国，汹涌澎湃的人民，反对在越南进行“卑鄙龌龊的战争”的愤怒浪潮，正在增长，人民群众坚决要求撤退远征队。在法意两国，争取和平的斗争正与争取用广泛的民主统一的政府来代替反动政府--美国帝国主义的傀儡的斗争融合起来。马歇尔化各国的劳动人民，支持世界和平大会常设委员会的号召，现正进行抗议，并且坚主各该国议会制止军备竞赛，废除北大西洋公约及交付美国军备的双边协定，积极支持苏联的建议：禁止原子武器及其他大规模屠杀的工具与缔结和平公约。
    目前，要置身于和平拥护者大军的行列，仅只发表宣言而不从事实际行动，那是不够的。用绥靖主义的祈祷是防止不了战争的。只有具体的行动才能把真正的和平拥护者与纵情于贩卖绥靖主义辞句的政客们区别开来。
    苏联所奉行的英明的、始终如一的、绝不妥协的和平政策--斯大林和平政策，使和平敌人的罪恶计谋挫败，它是对全体进步人类的一个富于感召力的范例。
    由于奠定社会主义的基础，加强防御力量，并在国内消灭帝国主义者的走狗，人民民主国家的劳动人民，正以他们的工作及政治活动来对和平事业作出具体的贡献。
    已摆脱了帝国主义的桎梏，并已开始了和平建设工作的伟大的中国人民，正在亚洲建立一个强大的和平堡垒。各殖民地与附属国家民族解放运动的斗士们，破坏着帝国主义主要的腹地，正以他们为自由与民族独立的英勇斗争来加强世界和平。
    和平的力量是浩荡的大军。它们的成功，使一切真正的和平斗士充满了对胜利的信心，然而，面对着民主阵营的这些成功，帝国主义者却益发暴跳如雷，益发加紧进行他们阴险的图谋了。北大西洋集团各国军费的增加，就是这种图谋的证明。新战争挑拨者的宣传，越来越猖獗了。
    杜鲁门又指拨数以十亿计的款项来制造原子武器。原子讹诈又在进行中。
    帝国主义者已经签署美械供应西欧各国的双边协定。显然，华尔街不满于一般地奴役西欧，而力图把每一马歇尔化国家个别地系在华盛顿马车之上。武装西欧各国，包括西德在内的工作，正在加紧进行；另一方面，在亚洲，也正在围绕着保大--一个没有帝国的皇帝--和蒋介石--一个没有军队的大元帅--进行鬼鬼祟祟的阴谋诡计。伴随帝国主义政客的活动的，是陆军与海军的活动。越南、印尼、马来亚和缅甸正在流血，帝国主义者力图在那些地方用火和剑来支撑那殖民奴役的正在崩解的基础，然而，却没有成功。美国的政客和将军们，窝藏并庇护着第二次世界大战时使用细菌武器的日本战犯，因为他们自己正在准备使用这种武器。
    在这种情况下，任何削弱争取和平斗争的行为都是犯罪的。一切消极和所谓“战争必不可免”的理论，或关于“苏联是个强有力的国家，无论如何必将战胜”，因此，就不需要“和平运动”的论辩，都不过是帝国主义宣传的回声罢了。帝国主义者利用一切手段来削弱和平运动，使和平运动陷于被动和消沉下去，从而为战争铺砌道路。人民群众将永不饶恕这些所谓理论的任何鼓吹者。
    共产党将无情地揭露：一切力图削弱和平运动的人，是帝国主义的同谋犯。
    共产党与工人党正在遵循着一九四九年十一月在匈牙利举行的情报局会议的具有历史意义的决定。在所向无敌的马列主义学说的启示之下，凭借着战后时期阶级斗争的全部经验，这些决定向和平拥护者指示了走向胜利的道路：和平运动的组织上的巩固与扩大：有责任起决定作用的工人阶级之积极参加这一运动；揭穿侵略者及其敌视人类的宣传；积极的具体的行动，对群众的倡议予以一切支持，把争取和平的斗争与争取民主的自由和国家的独立、争取面包和工作、争取劳动人民的社会权利的斗争不可分地联系起来。
    战争贩子所抱的削弱和平阵线的希望，是徒然的。争取和平的斗争还刚刚开始。帝国主义者应该知道，假如他们敢于发动战争，则和平阵营将以社会主义在全世界的胜利来结束它。两次世界大战的经验，都提供了这方面的明证。这一点可以从民主与社会主义阵营无法阻挠的力量增长中，明显地看出来。
    苏联与人民民主国家对帝国主义侵略的防御，乃是全世界劳动人民的切身事业，因为，反对战争的斗争，是和争取民主与社会主义的斗争不可分的。
    在我们的时代，列宁、斯大林的道路--和平与社会主义的道路，正在变成全世界千百万劳动人民的道路。斯大林思想--布尔什维克的思想——正在鼓舞着千百万的人民，领导着他们进行争取和平的斗争。斯大林是争取和平的斗争的旗帜。列宁主义乃是指出走向胜利的道路的万无一失的南针。
