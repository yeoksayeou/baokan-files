　　Nankou Railway Factory

    Launches Machine Maintenance Campaign

    Machine Production Efficiency Significantly Improved

    [Report from this newspaper] The Nankou Railway Factory, under the Zhangjiakou Railway Branch Bureau, has seen a completely new look for its machinery since launching the machine cleaning and care competition. Before liberation, the factory paid no attention to machine maintenance, resulting in more than 80% of the machines having damage. In order to extend the service life of the machinery and improve its efficiency, the Efficiency Section of the factory's Technology Department formulated machine cleaning and care competition methods and reward regulations, which came into effect in January. The Party, administration, and trade union jointly conduct inspections every ten days. As a result of in-depth mobilization and education to strengthen workers' sense of responsibility for caring for machinery, the first inspection on the 21st of last month showed that the factory's machinery had a completely new look, and all the oil and dirt accumulated in the gears and crevices for decades had been completely cleaned. Ten machines won awards. The second inspection on February 1st proved that machine production efficiency has significantly improved. For example, the steam parts and frame parts for medium-repaired locomotives No. 1949 and No. 1535 were completed two days ahead of schedule, and the average man-hours for major repairs of locomotive machinery in January decreased by 17.1 hours compared with December of last year. Fifteen machines won awards this time, six of which won awards consecutively.
