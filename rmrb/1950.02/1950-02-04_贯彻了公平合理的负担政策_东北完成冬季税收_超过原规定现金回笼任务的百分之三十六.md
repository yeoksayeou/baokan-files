Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 2nd: The winter tax collection work in various provinces and cities of Northeast China has been successfully completed, exceeding the cash recovery target set by the Northeast People's Government's Ministry of Finance by more than thirty-six percent.

When the Northeast Taxation Bureau deployed the winter tax collection work in October last year, it pointed out that November to March of this year is the peak season for tax collection. All levels of tax departments should, in addition to strengthening daily production and sales taxes, livestock slaughter taxes, and rectifying stall taxes, focus on collecting the second phase (May to October) of industrial and commercial income tax. After studying the collection steps and methods, the provincial taxation bureaus generally started collecting in mid-November. After more than a month of efforts, the collection task was fully completed at the beginning of last month, and most provinces exceeded the task. For example, Liaodong exceeded by 24 percent, Jilin by 15 percent, Songjiang by 12 percent, Heilongjiang by 6 percent, and Liaoxi by 1.5 percent. The increase in winter tax revenue, on the one hand, guaranteed the state's financial income and the accumulation of industrial construction funds, and on the other hand, it also guaranteed that state-owned commerce had sufficient funds to purchase surplus grain from farmers, enabling the state to control materials and stabilize prices.

The Northeast region has been collecting industrial and commercial income tax for more than three years. In this process, tax collection work has gradually moved from decentralization to unification, and tax policy has also moved from indistinct separation of industry and commerce to separate industry and commerce, from indistinct separation of public and private to separate public and private, and gradually distinguished between necessities and non-necessities, and levied taxes differently according to their importance. However, before 1949, due to insufficient experience in urban tax collection, especially the lack of sufficient understanding of the importance of urban tax collection, only collect as much as possible in the collection process, and rarely planned and deployed tax collection work according to the burden capacity of industrial and commercial operators. Moreover, the tax rate was also set very low. For example, in 1948, the burden on industrialists in the former Liaobei Province averaged 4.6 percent of their income, and the burden on commercial operators was 7.2 percent. When collecting the first phase (January to April) of industrial and commercial income tax in August last year, budget formulation and task allocation began, and it moved from unplanned to planned. However, due to the lack of accurate investigation and statistics on urban financial resources, the calculation of tasks and the burden capacity of industrial and commercial operators still inevitably had considerable blindness, resulting in an imbalance of burdens between regions, between industries, and between large and small merchants in the collection process. At the same time, there were still many cases of concealment and tax evasion among merchants, which affected the normal income of the state.

Experience 1: County and city leaders go deep into the grassroots, and people's congresses discuss taxation.

During the collection of the second phase of industrial and commercial income tax, local governments strengthened their leadership over the tax collection work. For example, many county and city mayors served as directors of the collection committees and personally explained the government's tax policy at business and people's congresses. The collection committees in Liaoxi and other places absorbed the participation of city and county industrial and commercial, finance section chiefs, public security bureau chiefs, and bank managers, so that all parties could cooperate with each other in tax collection work. Andong and other cities also discussed tax issues at the People's Congress. The Northeast Taxation Bureau and the provincial and municipal taxation bureaus also appropriately adjusted cadres and implemented a division of labor and responsibility system; many taxation bureau chiefs went deep into the grassroots to discover problems.

Experience 2: The three links of "operators' self-reporting, typical investigation, and democratic evaluation" cannot be neglected.

In the process of collection, all localities adopted the method of "operators' self-reporting, typical investigation, and democratic evaluation." According to local experience, the three links in the above methods cannot be neglected, but the central link of leadership is to master typical materials. Because without mastering typical materials, it is impossible to deeply understand the situation, and it is impossible to actively grasp leadership in the collection and democratic evaluation. During the typical account checking work in Liaodong, Liaoxi, Songjiang, and Rehe, many false accounts were found. According to statistics from the Northeast Taxation Bureau: false accounts generally account for more than 80 percent of the accounts of all private industrial and commercial operators, and concealed income generally reaches more than double, with a minimum of 50 percent. During the typical account checking in Xi'an City Taxation Bureau, Liaodong Province, 24 cadres were dispatched into seven groups to deeply inspect 40 private industrial and commercial households. As a result, a variety of methods of tax evasion were discovered. The pure profit concealed in tax evasion is generally two to three times the reported amount, with the maximum reaching nine and a half times, and the minimum being around one time. The first phase of income tax in the city totaled 2.864 billion yuan (Northeast Circulation Coupons), and many merchants called it "heavy tax," and some representatives of the industrial and commercial circles said at the People's Congress that the people's government's tax collection was unreasonable. After checking the accounts, the second phase of income tax increased by nearly doubled compared with the first phase, but most merchants believed: "The tax is not heavy, reasonable and fair." Unreasonable and mutually covering up phenomena occurred in the democratic evaluation in Liaoxi Province, which were corrected in the typical investigation. Therefore, private industrial and commercial operators quickly paid taxes, and Tieling and Suizhong and other places in the province completed the task ten days ahead of schedule.

Experience 3: Establish an invoice system and accounting system, and gradually move towards self-reporting and actual collection.

This time, the collection of industrial and commercial income tax in the Northeast, except for the phenomenon of unbalanced burdens on individual households or individual industries in individual regions, basically implemented a fair and reasonable burden policy. Therefore, the general industrial and commercial operators responded well and believed that the burden rate was not heavy. In the future, the tax collection work in the Northeast will be based on typical investigations, to achieve a comprehensive and systematic in-depth understanding, and focus on and step by step urge medium and large merchants to establish an invoice system and accounting system, so as to gradually move towards self-reporting and actual collection under strict management. In the investigation and research, attention will be paid to using publicity and education and patient persuasion, and at the same time, actively cultivate activists among industrial and commercial operators, so that democratic evaluation can be fair and reasonable. According to the industrial and commercial income tax regulations promulgated by the Northeast Administrative Committee last year, private industrial and commercial enterprises are taxed according to operating profit: industry is taxed at 3 percent to 17 percent, and commerce is taxed at 5 percent to 27 percent. According to statistics from Songjiang Province, the average burden rate for commerce is 18.5 percent, and for industry is 12.7 percent; the average industrial burden rate in Harbin City is 16.5 percent, and the commercial burden rate is 26.1 percent; the average burden rate for industry is 10.9 percent and for commerce is 14.9 percent according to statistics from four counties in Heilongjiang Province. The general burden surface (the burden surface is the number of burden households after deducting the exemption households that are not enough to reach the starting point for taxation) is also relatively accurate. According to statistics from Mudanjiang City, the commercial burden surface is 94.4 percent, and the industrial burden surface is 92.6 percent.

### 贯彻了公平合理的负担政策  东北完成冬季税收  超过原规定现金回笼任务的百分之三十六

　　贯彻了公平合理的负担政策
    东北完成冬季税收
    超过原规定现金回笼任务的百分之三十六
    【新华社沈阳二日电】东北各省市冬季税收工作已胜利完成，并超过了东北人民政府财政部规定的现金回笼任务的百分之三十六强。
    东北税务总局在去年十月布置冬季税收工作时，即指出十一月至今年三月是税收工作的旺季，各级税务部门除加强日常的产销税、牲畜屠宰税及整顿摊贩税等工作外，并应着重征好第二期（五月至十月）的工商所得税。各省税务局在研究了征收步骤和方法后，即普遍于十一月中旬开征。经过一个多月的努力，征收任务已于上月初全部完成，大部省份并超过了任务。如辽东超过百分之二十四，吉林超过百分之十五，松江超过百分之十二，黑龙江超过百分之六，辽西超过百分之一点五。冬季税收的增加，一方面保证了国家财政的收入和工业建设资金的积累，另一方面也保证了国营商业有相当资金可以收购农民余粮，使国家掌握了物资，稳定了物价。
    东北地区自开始征收工商所得税以来，已有三年多时间。在这个过程中，税收工作逐步地由分散走向统一，税收政策也由工商不分走向工商分开，由公私不分走向公私分开，并逐渐区别了必需品与非必需品，分别轻重课税。但在一九四九年以前，由于城市税收经验不足，特别是对城市税收的重要性没有足够的认识，因而在征收中只是收多少算多少，很少根据工商业者的负担能力来计划布置税收工作。而且税率也定得很低，例如一九四八年原辽北省工业者的负担平均为其所得的百分之四点六，商业者的负担为百分之七点二。去年八月征收第一期（一月至四月）工商所得税时，开始制定预算，分配任务，由无计划走向有计划，然而由于对城市财源没有精确的调查统计，所以在计算任务与工商业者的负担能力时，不免仍带有相当大的盲目性，造成了征收中若干地区与地区间、行业与行业间、大商户与小商户间的负担不平衡现象。同时商人中的隐瞒偷漏现象仍然很多，影响了国家的正常收入。
    经验之一：县市领导深入下层，人代会上讨论税收。
    在征收第二期工商所得税时，各地政府都加强了对税收工作的领导。如很多县市长都担任了征收委员会的主任，亲自到商民大会上解释政府的税收政策。辽西等地的征收委员会吸收了市、县工商、财政科长、公安局长、银行经理等参加，使各方面能够在税收工作中互相配合。安东等市并在人民代表会上讨论了税收问题。东北税务总局和各省市税务局也都适当调整了干部，实行分工负责办法；很多税务局长都深入下层发现问题。
    经验之二：“业者自报、典型调查、民主评议”三个环节不可偏废。
    在征收过程中，各地都采取了“业者自报、典型调查、民主评议”的方法。根据各地经验，上述办法中的三个环节不可偏废，但领导方面的中心环节则是掌握典型材料。因为不掌握典型材料，就不能深入了解情况，在征收与民主评议当中也无法主动地掌握领导。此次辽东、辽西、松江、热河很多地方在进行典型查账工作中，查出了很多假账。据东北税务总局统计：假账一般占全部私营工商业者账目的百分之八十以上，隐瞒所得一般达一倍以上，最低也有百分之五十。辽东省西安市税务局在进行典型查账中，派遣了二十四名干部分成七个组，深入检查了私营工商业四十户。结果发现了多种多样的偷漏方法。偷漏中隐瞒的纯收益一般为报额的二倍到三倍，最多者达九倍半，最少也在一倍上下。该市第一期所得税共征收二十八亿六千四百万元（东北流通券），不少商人们叫“税重”，有些工商界代表并在人民代表会上说人民政府税收不合理。经过查账后，二期所得税较第一期增加了将近一倍，但一般商人都认为：“税收不重，合理公平”。辽西省在民主评议中曾发生部分不合理的和相互包庇的现象，都在典型调查中得到纠正，因此私营工商业者都迅速纳税，该省铁岭、绥中等地都提前十天完成了任务。
  经验之三：建立发票制度与账簿制度，逐步走向自报实征。
    此次东北征收工商所得税，除个别地区尚有个别户或个别行业负担不平衡的现象外，基本上贯彻了公平合理的负担政策，因此一般工商业者反应良好，认为负担率并不重。今后东北的税收工作，将在典型调查的基础上，做到全面系统的深入了解，并有重点有步骤地督促中等以上的商户建立发票制度与账簿制度，以便逐步走向严格管理下的自报实征。在调查研究中，将注意多用宣传教育耐心说服的方式，同时在工商业者中注意培养积极分子，使民主评议能够公平合理。按去年东北行政委员会公布的工商所得税条例，规定私营工商业按营业利润所得：工业征收百分之三至百分之十七，商业征收百分之五至百分之二十七。现据松江全省统计，平均负担率商业为百分之十八点五，工业为百分之十二点七；哈尔滨市工业负担率平均为百分之十六点五，商业为百分之二十六点一；黑龙江省四个县材料统计，平均负担率工业百分之十点九，商业百分之十四点九。一般负担面（按负担面即是除去不足起征点之免征户后的负担户数）亦较确当。据牡丹江市统计，商业负担面百分之九十四点四，工业负担面百分之九十二点六。
