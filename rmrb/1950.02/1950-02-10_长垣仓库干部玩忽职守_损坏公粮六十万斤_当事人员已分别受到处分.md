　　Changyuan Warehouse Cadres Neglect Their Duties
	Damaging 600,000 Jin of Public Grain
	Personnel Involved Have Been Punished Accordingly
　　[Reported by this newspaper] The staff of the Changyuan County Warehouse in Pingyuan Province neglected their duties, damaging 600,009 jin of public grain (soybeans), causing a major loss to state property. The Pingyuan Provincial People's Government has given the derelict personnel the punishment they deserved. On October 4th last year, the Pingyuan Provincial Government received a report of damage to public grain at the Changyuan County Warehouse in Puyang Prefecture and immediately urged the relevant departments to conduct a thorough inspection. The Provincial Grain Bureau sent a special person to inspect. It was found that the reasons for the damage to public grain in the county were as follows: First, the warehouse selection was improper, and the equipment was very simple. After the autumn grain collection the previous year, the county stored 12 million jin of public grain soybeans in 73 warehouses. Most of these warehouses were damp and dilapidated. In the ten warehouses inspected this time, the proportion of spoiled warehouses (grain fever) was very small, and rain leaks and dampness were common. These warehouses were generally selected by district cadres, and the county warehouse never personally inspected them. Second, no one was specifically responsible for warehouse management. In name, everyone was in charge, but in reality, no one was in charge. Third, there was no set of grain management systems. No inspections or reports were made, so these shortcomings were not discovered for a long time. Fourth, the person in charge of the warehouse did not implement the instructions from higher levels and did not adopt the opinions of lower levels. The Commissioner's Office had twice arranged for grain turning and sunning, but the county warehouse did not implement it. In May of last year, when bad grain was discovered, the person in charge of the warehouse did not conduct a serious inspection. In July, the grain continued to rot, and the village deputy warehouseman requested disposal, but the person in charge of the county warehouse still refused to act. The above facts fully demonstrate that the serious bureaucratism of the leading departments and management personnel in the county's grain storage was the basic reason for the destruction of public grain.
	After clarifying the responsibility, the Pingyuan Provincial People's Government has given the derelict personnel corresponding punishments: Zhao Yangzhou, director of the Changyuan County Warehouse, did not inspect the selection of warehouses in the county; he did not seriously implement the Commissioner's Office's repeated arrangements for grain turning and sunning; and he did not adopt the opinions of his subordinates. He was the main person responsible for this incident, and it was decided to dismiss him from his post for investigation and hand him over to the judicial organs for handling. Cheng Rongjun, director of the county's Finance Section, never reported the warehouse situation to higher levels, showing serious liberalism, and was given the punishment of dismissal. Yuan Sheng, the original Commissioner of the Fourth Prefecture, and Wu Shengyu, the director of the Finance Section, should also bear certain responsibility for this matter. They have been transferred to work and the provincial government has informed them to conduct inspections. Jia Ruimin, deputy director of the Changyuan Warehouse, should also bear the main responsibility for this matter; but because he was very active in saving public grain during the rainy season and made some efforts to deal with bad grain, his merits and demerits offset each other, and he was exempted from punishment. The village deputy warehousemen in the areas with bad grain will be properly dealt with by the county government based on the specific circumstances. In order to prevent similar incidents from happening again in the future, the Pingyuan Provincial Government has decided to strengthen grain institutions at all levels, establish and improve the warehouse inspection and reporting system, and has decided to conduct a universal and in-depth education on protecting the property of the motherland among cadres.

　　长垣仓库干部玩忽职守
    损坏公粮六十万斤
    当事人员已分别受到处分
    【本报讯】平原省长垣县仓库工作人员玩忽职守，毁坏公粮（豆子）六十万零九千斤，造成对国家财产的重大损失。平原省人民政府已对失职人员分别给予应得处分。去年十月四日，平原省政府接获濮阳专区长垣县仓库发生毁坏公粮事件的报告，立即督促有关部门彻底检查。省粮食局派了专人前往检查。发现该县损坏公粮的原因有下面几种：第一、仓库选择不当，设备十分简陋。该县在前年秋征后，以公粮豆子一千二百万斤，分存于七十三个仓房内。这些仓库大多数都是潮湿破旧的。在此次检查的十个仓库中，污仓（粮食发烧）的比例甚少，漏雨反潮则是普遍现象。此等库房一般均为区干部所选择，县库从未亲自检查。第二、仓库管理无专人负责，名义上是大家管，实际上是谁也不管。第三、缺少一套粮食管理制度，不检查，不报告，使得上述缺点长期未能发现。第四、仓库负责人不执行上级指示，不采纳下级意见。专署曾先后两次布置倒仓翻晒，县库均未执行。去年五月发现坏粮，仓库负责人亦未认真检查。七月粮食继续霉烂，村代库员请求处理，县仓库负责人还不叫动。上述事实充分说明：该县保管粮食的领导部门和管理人员严重的官僚主义，是造成公粮毁坏的基本原因。
    平原省人民政府于查明责任后，对各渎职人员已分别予以处分：长垣县仓库主任赵仰周对该县仓房选择不加检查；专署再次布置倒仓翻晒，他都没有认真执行；对下级的意见也不采纳；他是此次事件的主要负责人，决定撤职查办，交司法机关处理。该县财政科长程荣俊对仓库情况从未向上级反映，表现了严重的自由主义，予以撤职处分。原四专署专员袁声及财政科长武圣域对此事亦应负一定责任，他们已经调动工作由省府转告他们检查。长垣仓库副主任贾瑞民对此事本亦应负主要责任；但因他在雨季中救护公粮非常积极，对坏粮处理尚称努力，功过相抵，免予处分。坏粮地方的村代库员着由县府根据具体情况，妥为处理。为使今后不再发生类似事件，平原省府已决定加强各级粮食机构，建立与健全仓库检查报告制度，并决定在干部中进行普遍深入的爱护祖国财产的教育。
