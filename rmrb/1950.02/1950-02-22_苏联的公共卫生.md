    Prevention and Public Health Education

    One of the functions of the Soviet Ministry of Public Health, in addition to treating patients, is to take various measures to prevent the occurrence of diseases and infectious diseases.

    One of the most effective measures is to maintain appropriate sanitary conditions in all factories.

    This is managed in the following way. In addition to the vast network of medical institutions that provide medical services to people in residential areas, each factory has its own medical station. In large factories, this medical station is headed by a doctor, with one or more other doctors and nurses to assist him. In small factories, the medical station is headed by a qualified nurse.

    The duties of these medical stations are to provide medicine; take preventive measures and supervise general sanitary conditions; and provide first aid treatment in the event of accidental injuries and sudden illnesses. If the case is serious, the medical station will provide first aid treatment and then send the patient to a specialist clinic or hospital for treatment.

    In larger factories, these stations are formalized medical departments (in fact, they are called that), which provide more specialized medical treatment in addition to first aid. A patient's chances of recovery, and sometimes even his life, depend entirely on whether the assistance he receives is timely and effective.

    Medical stations supervise occupational health and general sanitary conditions in factories. The medical station is one of the many departments in the factory; and one of the people in charge of managing the factory has a legal responsibility to maintain proper cleanliness and abide by safety rules. At the same time, as a public duty, the trade union also values the relevant provisions of the law and strictly abides by them.

    Medical stations pay attention to maintaining the cleanliness of workshops and work areas, the cleanliness of drinking water, and the sanitation of dining utensils and food preparation in factories. They also supervise the sanitation of nurseries and kindergartens set up for the children of factory workers.

    The staff of the medical stations are constantly concerned about the health of the workers, and if necessary, they advise them to take a rest, or transfer them to hospitals, sanatoriums, or resorts for treatment, or negotiate for a worker to be transferred to another job that is suitable for his or her health. They guide workers on health care and hygiene issues, and when necessary, they carry out vaccination and prevention of smallpox, acute gastrointestinal infectious diseases (cholera, typhoid, etc. - translator), and other diseases.

    Although the medical station is a part of the factory's organization, it is also part of the Ministry of Health system, so it is also responsible to the Ministry of Health. Therefore, it will not be restricted by local powers and is given the power to insist on adequate equipment to complete its tasks and to take legal action against offenders.

    Health Propaganda and Inspection

    Health propaganda has been widely popularized among the masses in both urban and rural areas of the Soviet Union. It is mainly promoted in conjunction with the four levels of practical health supervision and inspection.

    (1) Municipal health inspection: Attention is paid to maintaining proper water supply and sanitation, cleanliness of streets, squares, public gardens, etc., sanitation of houses, and removal of garbage. At present, when the whole country is busy with post-war recovery work, the importance of health inspection for the design and operation of residential areas, the selection of building street locations, the arrangement of directions, and the treatment of water sources, sewers, and garbage has increased.

    (2) School health inspection: It supervises the sanitary conditions in schools and other children's institutions (nurseries, kindergartens, orphanages), and the physical development of school children. According to the law signed by Lenin in 1922, the school doctor must examine the physical condition of each student twice a year and keep a set of physical development measurement records for each person at the beginning of the semester. The school authorities must arrange each classroom in a certain way (for example, arrange desks according to the size, vision, and hearing of the students), and at the end of the semester, he must make a report on the physical development of each student during the semester. And advise his parents on how to arrange his vacation.

    Before the war (1940), there were more than 6,000 summer camps prepared for students (called Young Pioneer Camps), with approximately two million students participating. At that time, another 450,000 students were receiving medical treatment in children's sanatoriums.

    (3) Food inspection: It supervises those places and shops that distribute, sell, and store food (warehouses, storage rooms, shops, markets, hotels, and small restaurants), or those places that manufacture or sell food (canned food factories, public canteens). The task of food inspectors is not only to pay attention to the method of food production and delivery so that it maintains proper hygiene, but also to strive to improve the quality of national diet - for example, to maintain an adequate supply of vitamins - and to carry out education on food hygiene.

    (4) Industrial hygiene inspection: As we understand it, it is to supervise the general sanitary conditions in all places where workers are employed so that safety rules are implemented.

    Epidemic Prevention Work

    The Soviet Anti-Epidemic Department bears the important task of preventing diseases. It entrusts specially trained doctors - epidemiologists - to do the work of vaccinating, searching for infectious diseases, sending infectious patients to hospitals, and disinfecting.

    The general situation of vaccination implemented in the Soviet Union can be seen from the facts of the year before the war. (1940) In the Russian Soviet Federated Socialist Republic, 1,001 people were vaccinated per 10,000 people, 1,033 people were vaccinated in Ukraine, and 1,064 people were vaccinated in Belarus. All infants are vaccinated against smallpox and tuberculosis before weaning.

    Thanks to the efforts of the Anti-Epidemic Department, the incidence of various epidemics in the Soviet Union has been significantly reduced compared with the situation before the revolution, and some diseases have now been completely eradicated. For more than 20 years, there have been no epidemics of plague, cholera, or smallpox, which were very rampant in the past, especially in the border areas of Russia. The incidence of typhoid fever has been reduced by 80%, diphtheria by 75%, and scarlet fever by 55%. Only a few individual cases of typhus occurred before the war.

    The work of preventing epidemics is mainly concentrated in epidemiological stations, which can be found in every major city and district capital. Each station is equipped with the following departments: (1) Statistics Department - keeps accurate records of the health of all the people, which is necessary for planning appropriate epidemic prevention work; (2) Laboratory Department - including both health and microbiology aspects, this department analyzes food and drinking water samples provided by health inspectors and sputum, throat secretion smears, etc. provided by epidemiologists; (3) Disinfection Department; and (4) Vaccination Department: vaccinations are carried out against smallpox, gastrointestinal infectious diseases, childhood infectious diseases, and other infectious diseases.

    Therefore, we can see that health authorities and anti-epidemic authorities are combined to carry out their work, which is extremely important for maintaining the health of all the people and preventing epidemics.

    Public Health Measures

    The Soviet revolution thoroughly overthrew the bureaucracy of the Tsarist era and established a new administrative system.

    Regarding the establishment of the People's Committee for Public Health, in order to attach importance to this important work - establishing a system to protect all aspects of the health of all the people - Lenin once said not to rush to establish a central government public health agency. He suggested that local groups should be established first, otherwise the new People's Committee would become "a commander without an army." However, in less than a year, on July 11, 1918, the Soviet government felt that it could establish a People's Committee for Public Health, just like a central agency, to direct all health care and hygiene affairs of the entire Russian Soviet Federated Socialist Republic.

    The health status of the general public in all aspects, as well as the health status of individual citizens, are included in the scope of work of the People's Committee for Public Health (renamed the Ministry of Health since March 15, 1946). This is a huge system, including countless medical centers, treatment institutions, sanatoriums, resorts, health organizations, etc., which are distributed throughout the country and directly led by it.

    At various stages, the organization of Soviet health work has been developed in a planned way. In the early days of the founding of the country, this was very important. At that time, during the civil war and foreign intervention and blockade, the country was plunged into extreme hardship and disaster, which led to the discovery of serious epidemics. In the years of peaceful construction that followed, it enabled the public health system to develop rapidly, ensuring that medical institutions were evenly distributed throughout the country and helping to improve the public health standards in backward areas of the country. The benefits of this plan were especially felt during the war, when fascist hooligans invaded the country and many large areas were ravaged and destroyed by the Nazis.

    Centralized leadership and planning are beneficial to the work of training, selecting, and assigning medical personnel, which is also the duty of the Ministry of Health. Medical school education, like all Soviet higher education institutions, is virtually free. 90% of students receive stipends, and school authorities may not charge more than the equivalent of one month's stipend from students throughout the year. Another approximately 40% of students, plus all students who served in the military during the war, are exempt from all fees. When they graduate, the young doctors are all at the disposal of the Ministry of Health and are sent to serve in those places where they are most needed for a period of years. As an example, since the end of the war, many medical school graduates have been sent to work in areas formerly occupied by the German army because medical work in those areas was completely destroyed by the Nazi invaders.

    A planned national medical work is also beneficial to doctors themselves. Unemployment does not occur among medical workers in the Soviet Union. On the contrary, the rapidly developing national health cause needs a large number of medical workers and can accommodate a large number of medical school graduates every year.

    Every Soviet doctor, in addition to serving in state agencies, can have the right to practice privately.

    There are also a few specialist clinics run by medical experts on a cooperative basis, and unlike state-run specialist clinics, they can charge fees. Of course, they are in a secondary position compared to state-run medical institutions because the state has a vast hospital system that provides free and reliable services to all citizens.

    It is a common glory for Soviet medical personnel to use the best possible treatment to promote the early recovery of each patient. If necessary, they consult with experts or refer patients to experts, who are attached to hospitals and specialist clinics. They are able to obtain the most expensive treatments for patients or send patients to hospitals for treatment. Soviet doctors take professional pride in seeing that the hospitals, specialist clinics, clinics, or medical stations they serve are well-equipped and work effectively.

    Another characteristic of Soviet public health work is that it benefits from the spirit of cooperation between the whole people and it.

    In 1918, Lenin instructed all Soviets that they must "educate all working people so that they can assume part of the independent responsibility in state administration, which is not theory but must be manifested in practical work."

    This is the principle implemented by Soviet health work, and its slogan is "The health of the people is the people's own business."

    In the difficult days of the establishment of the Soviet government, the masses of people were mobilized to participate in the construction of health institutions. During the civil war, when epidemics, especially typhus, were rampant, "Cleanliness Committees" were created spontaneously by the masses everywhere, whether in cities, villages, factories, workshops, families, or Red Army teams. The duties of these committees were to pay attention to the cleanliness of each family and public place, and to pay attention to the proper management of public bathhouses, laundries, etc. The masses of people first rose up to put out the epidemic work, and its contribution was great.

    When the first maternity and child welfare centers were established, women's organizations did a lot of things to find houses for them and repair and decorate them. They mended clothes for the children and tried to ensure that they had an adequate supply of food. In those painful days, such mass help was very valuable.

    Each city and rural workers' and people's representative Soviet has its own public health department. These public health departments are guided by the Soviet and rely on the help of a group of organized volunteers. They do not interfere in the medical affairs of the local health authorities but help them with building repairs, finding furniture and equipment, and obtaining fuel.

    During the war, these volunteer helpers helped the medical and health institutions maintain a high level of work efficiency in material terms. In rural areas, they pay attention to the water supply, keep it clean, clean the streets and markets properly, and help medical workers take various infectious disease prevention methods.

    The public health authorities arrange short educational courses for these volunteer health personnel and convene them regularly to review their work and exchange experiences.

    The promotion of health education relies on the help of newspapers, books, lectures, movies, and radio.

    In cities, such public health education is organized and led by health education centers. Each such center has a permanent exhibition room that welcomes residents of its area to visit. Sometimes it sends people to factories and offices to give lectures and helps local authorities mobilize and train volunteer public health inspectors.

    The Red Cross and Red Crescent are the two largest organizations that handle the popularization of common sense of hygiene. Before the war, the Red Cross had 8 million members, and during the war, it increased to 12 million members.

    In the midst of the war, public health became the business of all the people, who believed that its importance could defeat the enemy. In this stage, the Red Cross trained 282,000 nurses, 498,000 female first-aid workers, and supplied 565,000 blood donors. 600,000 Red Cross members helped care for the wounded in various army hospitals. These members paid attention to the cleanliness of houses everywhere, helped disinfect clothes and build public bathrooms, and took care of the sick and elderly in the families of disabled soldiers. Red Cross members showed a sincere spirit of patriotic service during the war.

    In rural areas, the health education center sets up a rural reading room for its cultural activities, where it uses talks, lectures, movies, and other methods to instill knowledge of cleanliness and hygiene.

    Another health method that benefits from mass help is to plant trees and shrubs and arrange parks and playgrounds in residential areas.

    Soviet public health work maintains close contact with medical science, and medical science in turn draws on the rich experience collected from numerous research institutes and laboratories and from the vast hospitals and specialist clinics across the country.

    When the People's Committee for Public Health was established, it established a medical science conference and invited the most famous medical personnel in the country to attend the conference.

    This medical science conference examines all issues related to public health and conducts scientific research and explanation. The conference is divided into several review groups, each of which handles several specialized departments: such as epidemiology, diet, maternity and child welfare, etc. This conference approves the scientific work plans of various medical research and medical universities and helps promote their activities.

    On July 30, 1944, when the war between the Soviet Union and Germany had entered its fourth year, the Soviet government decided to establish an Academy of Medical Sciences. This is another fact that proves that in the midst of the largest war in Soviet history, no hardship or difficulty was allowed to stop the development of her medical science.

    On November 14, 1944, the list of the founders of the hospital was announced. Among the world-renowned scientists, it included A. Abrixosov, director of the Institute of Pathological Anatomy and president of the First Moscow Medical School, A. Bogomolete, president of the Ukrainian Academy of Sciences, whose book on bacterial reaction force (defense force) is famous in the Soviet Union and other countries; N. Burdenko, the founder of the Soviet neurosurgery school; L. Orbeli and K. Bykov, who continued to study the work left by the great physiologist Ivan Pavlov; B. Zbarsky, a biochemist who invented the embalming method for Lenin's body; V. Filatov, famous for his method of transplanting body tissues.

    Those excellent institutes of medical biology, hygiene, microbiology, epidemiology, clinical medicine, pediatrics, psychiatry and other departments are now managed by this newly established Academy of Medical Sciences. Therefore, the hospital's activities include all medical departments.

    The newly added academicians of the newly established Academy of Medical Sciences were elected from the hospital's second congress (October 28 to November 2, 1945).

    At the 1945 conference, many papers were read, criticizing the recent work of various departments of medical departments and public health organizations. They solved the problems of pure science and practical work. In terms of pure science papers, the two articles "Mechanical and Coordinated Movement" by Aubeli and "Bacterial Protection Force" by Bogomolets and Splansky were the most novel. Many papers solved the practical problems of the post-war class, such as "The Impact of War on Health and Methods of Eliminating It" by Ximashke; "Residential Area Health" by Xixin; "Epidemiology Problems" by Glomshiweski; "Neurology Problems" by Gleshuchin; "Theoretical and Practical Problems of Obstetrics and Gynecology" by Malinowski.

    Medical research work in the Soviet Union is not only carried out in the various research institutes affiliated with the Academy of Medical Sciences, but also in those large scientific centers such as Moscow, Leningrad, Kiev, Kharkov and Tiebeles, and also in laboratories far from the city and small in scale.

    Among the Soviet medical workers, there is a common desire to make their scientific knowledge perfect. For this purpose, they can all use the laboratories set up throughout the country and a large number of scientific documents, and they also have the opportunity to discuss with famous scientists in major cities and autonomous provinces. Therefore, although scientific research in the Soviet Union is highly centralized, it can also be said to be decentralized in this sense. Of course, scientific research in various autonomous provinces mainly focuses on local problems. For example, the Turkestan Tropical Disease Research Institute, presided over by Professor Yi Ruoyev, has done important work on American leishmaniasis and Oriental sores, etc., and has gained valuable results from the research on tick-borne encephalitis in the Far East. Research work continues to be carried out in many large hospitals in various cities.

    Soviet medical workers are staunch believers in the unity of scientific theory and practice.

　　苏联的公共卫生
    苏联Ｎ·西马史克作  林枫黄应南合译
    本文许多观点与方法，很可以作为我们新中国卫生建设工作的楷模，这里所发表的仅是全文的节译。    
    编者
    预防与公共卫生教育
    苏联公共卫生部全部工作之一，除了治疗病人之外，就是采取各种措施来预防疾病与传染病的发生。
    那些最有效的措施之一，就是使各个工厂保持适当的卫生条件。
    这是按照下列方式来管理的。除了那广大的医疗机构网，对那些住宅区里的人民供应医药服务以外，每个工厂都有它自己的医药站，在大的工厂里，这医药站是由一个医生负责，另外有一个或几个医生和护士帮助他工作，在小的工厂中这医药站是由一个合格的护士负责。
    这些医药站的职务是供给医药；采取预防措施和对一般的卫生情况实施监督；在发生意外的伤害与突然的疾病时，予以急救治疗。假若病例很严重，该医药站在施以急救治疗以后，即将病人送到分科门诊所或医院中去医治。
    在较大的工厂中，这些站都是正规化的医药部门（事实上是这样称呼的），除了急救治疗以外，还施以更专门的医药治疗。一个病人的复原机会，有时候甚至于他的生命全靠他们给予他的帮助是否及时与有效而决定的。
    医药站对工厂中的劳动卫生与一般的卫生情况实施监督。医药站是工厂中许多部门之一；而且管理工厂的负责人之中，有一个人对保持适当的清洁卫生与遵守安全的规则，负有法律上的责任。同时，作为一件公共的义务，职工会也重视法律上与此有关的各项条款，并严格地遵守。
    医药站对保持工厂内部的工作室与工作场的清洁，饮水的清洁，对餐室用具及食物调制等卫生都要注意的。还监督为工厂职工的孩子们所设立的托儿所与幼稚园的卫生。
    医药站的工作人员，经常关切工人们的健康，如有需要劝告他们休养，或给他们转送医院，疗养院，或疗养地去治疗，或为一个工人去交涉给他调到另一个适合于他或她的健康情况的工作岗位上去，在工人中指导他们关于保健与卫生方面的教育问题，并且于必要时，他们对天花、急性胃肠传染病（霍乱伤寒等——译者）及其他疾病进行接种预防。
    虽然医药站是工厂的机构之一部，而它同时也是卫生部系统的一部分，所以，它对卫生部还得负责的。因此它是不会受到局部权力的限制，并给它权力去坚持要求充分的设备，完成它的任务，对那些犯罪者采取合法的控诉。
    卫生宣传与检查
    卫生宣传在苏联境内已经广泛的普及到城乡的群众中间了。它主要是结合着那四级的实际卫生监督和检查而推进的。
    （１）市政卫生检查：对维持适当的水源供给和卫生，街道、广场、公共花园等地的清洁，房屋的卫生，与垃圾的清除都加以注意。目前全国正忙于作战后恢复工作的时候，对于那些住宅区的设计与经营，建筑物街道位置的选择，方向的布置，水源、下水道与垃圾的处理等卫生检查所担负的重要性，已经增加了。
    （２）学校卫生检查：它对学校与别的儿童机关（托儿所、幼稚园、孤儿院）中的卫生情况，及学校儿童体格的发育情形实行监督。根据列宁在一九二二年所签署的法律规定，学校校医每年必须要检查每个学童的体格二次，并要保存每个人的一套在学期开始时的体格发育测量纪录。学校当局要怎样地来布置各个教室（例如要按学生的大小、视力、与听觉来排列书桌），在学期终了的时候，他要给每个学童在这学期中的体格发育情况做一个报告。并忠告他的父母怎样为他来安排假期。
    在战前（一九四○年）有六千以上的夏令营是为学童们准备的（称为少年先锋营），大约有二百万学童参加。当时另有四十五万个学童在儿童疗养院中进行医疗。
    （３）食物检查：它对分配、出售、储藏食物的那些地方与商店（仓库、储藏室、店铺、市场、酒店与小饮食店），或者是制造或贩卖食品那些地方（罐头食品工厂、公共食堂）实行监督。食品检查员的任务不仅注意食品的制法和传递的方式，使它保持适当的卫生，而且还要努力改进民族饮食的品质——例如维持供给适当的维他命——并进行有关食物卫生的教育。
    （４）工业卫生检查：就我们所了解的是在所有雇用工人的地方，监督一般的卫生情况，使它实行安全规则。
  流行病预防工作
    苏联防疫处担负了预防疾病的重要任务。它委托受过专门训练的医生们——流行病学专家——去做那些接种疫苗，寻查传染病，送传染病人到医院，及消毒等工作。
    苏联国内所实施的接种疫苗的普遍情形，可以从战前那一年的事实上看到。（一九四○年）在俄罗斯苏维埃联邦社会主义共和国中每一万人接种一○○一人，在乌克兰接种一○三三人，在白俄罗斯接种一○六四人。所有的婴儿在断乳以前无例外都要接种天花与肺结核预防疫苗。
    感谢防疫处的努力，使苏联境内各种流行病的发生比革命前的情况已经有了显著的锐减，有些疾病现已完全绝迹。二十多年来，已经没有发生过鼠疫、霍乱或天花等流行病，这些病在过去，特别是在俄罗斯边疆的区域里很猖獗。伤寒病的发病率已减少了百分之八十，白喉减少了百分之七十五，猩红热减少了百分之五十五，在战前只发生过几个个别的斑疹伤寒例。
    预防流行病的工作，主要集中在流行病学站，这是在每个大城市与区的首都均可以找到的，每个站都设有下列各部门：（一）统计部——全体人民的健康保持确切的记载，这对计划适当的预防流行病工作是必要的；（二）化验部——包括卫生和微生物学两方面，对卫生检查员所提供的食物与饮水等标本和流行病专家所提供的痰，咽喉分泌物涂抹等标本都在此部进行分析；（三）消毒部；与（四）接种疫苗部：对天花、胃肠传染病、儿童传染病与其它传染病施行接种预防。
    因此，我们可以看到卫生当局与防疫当局是结合着进行他们的工作，这点对于保持全体人民的健康与预防流行病等工作是极关重要的。
    公共卫生措施
    苏维埃革命彻底推翻了沙皇时代的官僚政体，而建立了一个新的行政体系。
    关于设立人民卫生委员会的问题，为了重视此项重要的工作，——建立一个保护全体人民各方面的健康的系统——列宁曾经说过不要太急的设立一个中央政府的公共卫生机构。他建议首先要在各地方设立地方团体，否则这个新的人民委员会就会成为“一个没有军队的统帅”。然而未满一年，于一九一八年七月十一日苏维埃政府觉得可以设一个人民卫生委员会了，真像一个中央机构一样，指挥全俄罗斯苏维埃联邦社会主义共和国一切保健与卫生事务。
    一般人民各方面的健康状态，以及个别的公民健康状态都包括在人民卫生委员会（自一九四六年三月十五日起改称卫生部）的工作范围内。这是一个庞大的系统，包括有无数的医药中心，治疗机关，疗养院，疗养地，卫生组织等都分布全国各地直接受它领导。
    在各个不同阶段，苏维埃的卫生工作组织是有计划的发展的。在开国初期，这是非常重要的，那时，正当内战和外国干涉与封锁的时候，使国家陷入极端的艰苦和灾难之中，以致发现了严重的流行病。在以后和平建设的几年中，它使公共卫生系统发展得很快，它保证将医务机关平均地分布全国各地，帮助国内落后区域的公共卫生水准提高了一步。这种计划的好处，特别是在这次大战期间才感觉到的，那时正当法西斯流氓侵入国境，许多大地区都受到纳粹的蹂躏与破坏。
    集中领导与计划，对于训练、挑选、与分配医务人员的工作是有利的，这也是卫生部的职务。医药学校的教育像所有苏维埃高等教育机关一样，实际上都是免费。学生中有百分之九十都是接受俸给的，而学校当局全年收费额，不得超过相等于学生一个月俸给的数目。另外约有百分之四十的学生，加上所有在这次战争中参加部队服务的学生，都免付一切费用。当毕业时，那些年轻的医生都听候卫生部派往那些最需要他们工作的地方去服务一个若干年的时期。举一个例，自从这次战争结束以来，许多医校毕业生都被派送到以前被德军占领过的地区中去工作，因为那些地方的医务工作是完全被纳粹侵略者毁坏殆尽了。
    一个有计划的国家医药工作对医生们本身也是有利的。在苏联的医务工作者中间是不会发生失业这种事情的。相反地，那些迅速发展的国家卫生事业需要大批的医务工作者，每年能够容纳大批的医校毕业的学生。
    每个苏联的医生，除了在国家机关中服务外，都可以有私人开业的权利。
    还有少数几个分科门诊所是由医学专家们在合作的基础上经营的，它们不像国立的分科门诊所一样，他们是可以收费的。当然它们比较国立的医药机构，要处在次要的地位，因为国家有广大的医院系统，给一切公民服务都是免费而且可靠的。
    给每个病人，尽可能施用最好的疗法促其早日痊愈，这是苏联医务人员共同认为一件光荣的事情。如果有需要的话，他们就和专家们商量或介绍病人到专家处去，这些专家都附在医院和分科门诊所内，他们能够为了病人去获取那些最昂贵的治疗法或将病人送进医院去治疗。苏联的医生们，看到他们自己服务的医院，分科门诊所，诊所，或医药站，都装备的很完善并且工作的很有效，他们都引为业务上的骄傲。
    苏联公共卫生工作另外一个特点，就是在工作中，得力于全体人民和它合作的精神。
    列宁于一九一八年指示各个苏维埃必须“教育全体劳动人民，要他们在国家行政方面担负起一部分独立的责任，这不是理论而是要在实际工作上表现的。”
    这就是苏维埃卫生工作所执行的原则，它的口号是“人民的健康就是人民自己的事”。
    在苏联政府成立初期的困难日子里，曾经动员人民大众来参加建设卫生机构。在内战时期，当流行病特别是斑疹伤寒猖獗的时候。“清洁委员会”在任何地方，无论是城市、乡村、工厂、作坊、家庭与红军队伍里，都由人民大众自动地创设起来。这些委员会所负的义务责任是注意各个家庭及公共场所，使它保持清洁，并注意各个公共浴堂、洗衣房等，使它管理适当。人民大众首先起来扑灭流行病工作，它的功绩是很大的。
    当设立第一个妇婴福利中心的时候，妇女组织作了很多事情，为它们找房屋，还给它们修理布置。她们为儿童们缝补衣服，并设法使他们很适当的得到食品的供给，在那些痛苦的日子里，这样的群众的帮助是很有价值的。
    每个城市的和乡村的工人与人民代表苏维埃，各有他自己的公共卫生部门。这些公共卫生部门都受该苏维埃的指导，并依靠一批有组织的志愿参加者的帮助。他们对当地卫生机关的医药方面的事务，并不干涉，而帮助他们做些房屋修建，找些家具和装备及获得燃料等事情。
    在这次战争中，这些志愿助手在物质方面已经帮助了那些医药卫生机关维持高水平的工作效率。在乡村中，他们注意饮水供给，使它保持洁净，街道市场使它很适当的打扫清洁，并且帮助那些医务工作者采取各种传染病的预防方法。
    公共卫生当局为这些志愿卫生人员布置短期的教育课程，与按期召集他们开会，检讨他们的工作以交换经验。
    卫生教育的推行是依靠报章、书籍、演讲、电影与无线电的帮助。
    在城市中这样的公共卫生教育是由卫生教育中心来组织和领导的。每一个这样的中心有一个永久性的陈列室，招待它本地区的居民来参观，有时候它派遣人员去工厂与办公室演讲，并帮助地方当局动员与训练志愿公共卫生检查员。
    红十字会与红新月会是两个最大的办理普及卫生常识的机关。在战前红十字会有八百万个会员，而在战争期间增加到一千二百万名会员。
    在战争进行中间，公共卫生成为全体人民的事务，他们认为它的重要性是可以战胜敌人的，在这阶段中，红十字会训练了二十八万二千名护士，四十九万八千名女急救员，它并供给了五十六万五千名输血者。六十万名红十字会会员在各陆军医院里帮助看护伤员，这些会员们注意各处的住宅使它保持清洁，帮助衣服消毒与建造公共浴室，并照顾残废军人家属中的病人与老年人。红十字会的会员们在战争期间表现了真诚的爱国的服务精神。
    在乡村方面，卫生教育中心为它的文化活动设一乡村阅览室，在那里用谈话、演讲、电影等方式来灌输清洁卫生知识。
    得力于大众帮助的另一个卫生方法，就是在住宅区内栽植树木与灌木并布置公园与游戏场。
    苏维埃公共卫生工作与医药科学保持着密切的联系，而医药科学轮流着从许多研究所和实验室里，吸收到全国广大的医院与分科门诊所所收集的丰富经验。
    在人民卫生委员会建立的时候，它设立了一个医药科学会议，邀请全国最著名的医务人员出席会议。
    这个医药科学会议审查一切关于公共卫生方面的问题而在科学上做研究与解释。会议内部分成若干审查小组，每一小组办理几个专门的部门：如流行病学，饮食，妇婴福利等。这会议通过各医药研究与医科大学的科学工作计划，并帮助促进他们的活动。
    一九四四年七月三十日当苏联与德国的战争已经迈入第四个年头的时候，苏联政府决定设立一个医药科学院。这又是一个事实证明，在苏联历史上最大一次战争中间，任何艰苦困难都不允许它阻止了她的医药科学的发展。
    一九四四年十一月十四日宣布了该院创始人的名单。在世界著名的科学家中，它包括了阿别里考索夫（A.Abrixosov）病理解剖院院长，兼莫斯科第一医科学校校长，保格墨勒茨（A.Bogomolete），乌克兰科学院院长，他的细菌反应力（保卫力）那本著作在苏联和世界各国都是闻名的；陪登柯（N.burdenko），苏维埃神经外科学校的创办人；奥陪里（L.Orbeli）与排考夫（K.Bykov），继续研究伟大的生理学家巴夫洛夫（Ivan pavlov）所留下来的工作；柴勃斯基（B.Zbarsky），生物化学家，他发明列宁遗体的防腐法；唯拉托夫（V.Filatov），因他的移植身体组织方法而出名的。
    那些医学生物学，卫生学，微生物学，流行病学，临床医学，小儿科学，精神病学与别的最优良的研究所，现都已由这个新成立的医药科学院管理。因此该院的活动包括了所有的医学部门。
    该新成立的医药科学院新增加的院士，都是从该院第二届大会中选举出来的（一九四五年十月二十八日至十一月二日）。
    在一九四五年这届大会中，宣读了许多论文，批评医药部门和公共卫生组织各方面的最近工作。他们解决了纯科学与实际工作的问题。在纯科学方面的论文，以奥陪里著的“机械与协调的运动”，保格墨勒茨和斯泼兰司基合著的“细菌的保护力”两篇文章，最为新颖。有许多论文是解决战后阶级的实际问题的，例如西马史克著的“战争对于卫生的影响及消除他的方法”；悉信著的“住宅区卫生”；格洛姆希维司基著的“流行病学问题”；格勒许钦柯著的“神经学问题”；麦林诺夫司基著的“妇产科的理论与实践问题”。
    苏联境内的医药研究工作不仅是在医药科学院所附属的各个研究所内进行，也不仅在像莫斯科，列宁格勒，基辅，卡尔考夫与铁别列斯这些大的科学中心，而且亦在离城市远的和规模小的实验室中进行着。
    苏维埃医务人员中，有一个普遍的愿望，就是要使他们的科学知识进臻完善。为了这个目的，他们都可以自己使用全国各地设立的实验室，和大批的科学文献，还给他们机会去与各大城市中及各自治省境内的著名科学家进行讨论。所以苏联的科学工作虽然是高度集中的，但在这点意义上说来亦可说是分散在各地方的。当然各个自治省科学的研究，主要的还是专心于当地的问题。例如土耳其斯坦热带病研究所由易若耶夫教授主持的对美洲利什曼病东方疮等病上已经做了很重要的工作，在远东方面由壁虱脑炎的研究中得到很有价值的收获。研究工作在各城市许多大的医院中继续不断的进行着。
    苏维埃医务工作者，是科学的理论与实践一致的坚决的信仰者。
