　　Over the past six months, the Songhu Garrison of the People's Liberation Army's Third Field Army has been performing factory guard duties, mutually assisting and learning from hundreds of thousands of local workers, improving their work, and strengthening unity. When the unit began its guard duties at Shanghai factories in July of last year, some commanders and soldiers, not understanding the deep exploitation and oppression suffered by workers before liberation, coupled with some existing peasant narrow-mindedness, "disapproved" of the workers' lives. At the same time, some workers felt that the Liberation Army comrades were cold, rigid, and had low education levels, making it difficult to approach them, due to language barriers. Therefore, there were some gaps between some of the army and the workers. In order to further strengthen the relationship between the army and the workers, the Political Department of the Songhu Garrison instructed its subordinate units in September of last year to carry out mutual teaching work between soldiers and workers, stipulating that the stationed company should assist the factory's work under the unified plan and leadership of the factory's military representative, the Communist Party branch, and the trade union. The stationed troops immediately carried out strict policy and discipline education, calling on all commanders and soldiers to strictly abide by discipline, be loyal to their duties, respect workers, and cherish factories. The following methods were used to carry out mutual education between the army and workers and strengthen mutual unity: (1) Regularly hold joint gatherings and forums between the army and workers, where army comrades introduced battle stories and troop life, and workers introduced the oppression and suffering they endured under the dark rule of the Kuomintang, and their heroic struggles. Often, the workers cried, and the soldiers cried too. (2) Organize visits to factories to enable cadres and soldiers to understand machinery and modern scientific production methods, and to understand and learn the working class's organization, discipline, and unity. Many soldiers, after seeing the large-scale scientific production and the intense labor of the workers in a certain steel plant, recognized the greatness of the workers' labor, recognized the important role of large-scale modern industrial production in national construction, thereby enhancing their respect for workers and their concept of cherishing factories, and consciously strengthening the guard work to protect factories. (3) The army helps workers' schools with political lessons, teaches singing, holds friendly sports competitions, and publishes joint army-worker wall newspapers. The wall newspapers mutually introduce struggle stories, living conditions, and scientific knowledge, compensating for the difficulties of language barriers. (4) The army helps workers clean factories, transport materials, and engage in general heavy labor, helps factories establish picket teams, and teaches workers to shoot and stand guard. Some companies jointly discuss with factories how to set up posts, and some troops send people to participate in the factory's air defense, fire prevention, and anti-special forces organizations, jointly responsible for protecting the factory's safety. (5) The leaders of the troops and factories jointly participate in discussions on meetings related to the relationship between the troops and the workers. The Political Department of the Songhu Garrison also organized eleven work teams to go to various factories to help with work. The task of the work team is, on the one hand, to assist the trade union in educating and organizing workers, and on the other hand, to study how to strengthen the unity between the stationed guard troops and the workers. In order to be in step with the factory's work, the Communist Party members in the army work team all participated in the Communist Party branch of the factory. When the army work team first arrived at the factory, some factory military representatives and trade union work teams believed that the army comrades would not do workers' work, and the workers did not understand the nature of the army work team and were unwilling to approach them. The army work team humbly learned, took the initiative to approach the workers, and went deep into the workshops, gradually getting closer to the workers in thought and emotion. The factory and the workers' impression of the army work team also changed, and they often took the initiative to find the army work team to study and cooperate with work. From September to November of last year, in three months, the army work team united the activists among the workers and helped establish trade unions and picket teams in eleven factories, developed 11,962 trade union members, 831 Youth League members, organized 4,462 picket team members, and helped various factories establish cooperatives, wall newspapers, blackboard newspapers, singing teams, Yangko teams, literary work groups, gong and drum teams, drama teams, training classes, night schools, and sports teams. At the same time, the workers also actively helped the troops solve various difficulties such as housing and utensils, and automatically helped the troops manufacture blackboards for learning, parallel bars and wooden horses for training. The soldiers and workers were very harmonious and intimate. The workers of the Shanghai Waterworks closed the windows and covered the soldiers with quilts every night when they went to work, fearing that they would catch a cold. With the help of the workers, the guard work of the troops became more thorough.

　　淞沪警备部队深入工厂
    战士工人互相学习  加强团结改进工作
    政治部派十一个工作组赴各厂深入车间工作
    【新华社上海三十一日电】人民解放军第三野战军淞沪警备部队，半年来在执行工厂警备任务中，与当地数十万工人互相帮助，互相学习，改进了工作，加强了团结。该部于去年七月开始担任上海各工厂的警备任务时，由于部分的指战员不了解工人在解放前所受的深重的剥削和压迫，再加本身存在着某些农民的狭隘意识，便对工人的生活“看不惯”，同时也有部分的工人因解放军说话不懂，感到军队同志冷淡、呆板、文化程度低，难以接近；因此部分军队与工人间存在着某些隔阂。淞沪警备政治部为了进一步密切军队与工人之间的关系，乃于去年九月指示所属部队开展兵教工、工教兵的互教工作，规定驻厂连队应在工厂军事代表、共产党支部、工会的统一计划与领导下帮助工厂工作。各驻厂部队当即普遍进行了严格的政策纪律教育，号召全体指战员严守纪律，忠于职守，尊敬工人，爱护工厂，并通过下面各种方式实行军队和工人互相教育和加强相互间的团结。（一）经常举行军队和工人的联欢会、座谈会，由军队同志介绍战斗故事与部队生活，由工人介绍过去在国民党黑暗统治下所受的压迫、痛苦，和他们英勇斗争的事迹。常常工人哭了，战士也哭了。（二）有组织地参观工厂，使干部战士了解机器与近代化的科学生产方式，了解与学习工人阶级的组织性、纪律性和团结性。许多战士看了某炼钢厂巨大规模的科学化的生产与工人们紧张劳动后，认识了工人劳动的伟大，认识了大规模近代化的工业生产对国家建设所起的重要作用，从而提高了尊敬工人和爱护工厂的观念，自觉地加强了保护工厂的警卫工作。（三）军队帮助工人学校上政治课，教唱歌，举行友谊体育竞赛，出版军工联合壁报，通过壁报互相介绍斗争故事、生活情况、科学常识，补救了言语不通的困难。（四）军队帮助工人打扫工厂，搬运物资及从事一般的笨重劳动，帮助工厂成立纠察队，教工人打枪和放哨。有的连队与工厂共同商讨如何设立岗位，有的部队并派人参加工厂的防空防火防特的组织，共同负责保护工厂的安全。（五）部队和工厂的负责人共同参加讨论有关军队与工人间关系的会议。淞沪警备政治部并组织了十一个工作组派赴各厂帮助工作，工作组的任务一方面是协助工会教育工人，组织工人，另一方面是研究如何加强驻厂警备部队与工人的团结。为了与工厂工作步调一致，军队工作组中的共产党员都参加工厂中共产党的支部。军队工作组初到工厂时，有些工厂的军事代表和工会工作组认为部队同志不会做工人工作，工人不了解军队工作组的性质，不愿接近，军队工作组便虚心学习，主动接近工人，深入车间，渐渐与工人在思想上感情上接近起来，厂方与工人们对军队工作组的印象也转变了，常常主动找军队工作组研究和配合工作。自去年九月至十一月的三个月中，军队工作组团结工人中的积极分子，帮助建立了十一个工厂的工会与纠察队，发展工会会员一万一千九百六十二人，青年团员八百三十一人，组织纠察队员四千四百六十二人，并帮助各厂建立了合作社、壁报、黑板报、歌咏队、秧歌队、文艺工作组、锣鼓队、话剧队、训练班、夜校、球队等。同时工人也积极帮助部队解决住房，用具等各种困难，自动帮助部队制造学习用的黑板，练兵用的双杠木马等，战士和工人非常融洽亲密。上海自来水厂的工人每晚上班时，都替战士关窗户、盖被子，怕他们受凉。部队在工人的帮助下，警备工作也更趋周密。
