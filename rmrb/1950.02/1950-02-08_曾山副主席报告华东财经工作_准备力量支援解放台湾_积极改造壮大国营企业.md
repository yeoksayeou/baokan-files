Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 5th—Vice Chairman Zeng Shan of the East China Military and Political Committee reported on the financial and economic situation in East China and future tasks at the first meeting of the East China Military and Political Committee. Vice Chairman Zeng summarized the main work situation from 1947, when the Chiang Kai-shek bandits launched a major offensive against Shandong, until the complete liberation of mainland East China at the end of 1949, saying: Before the crossing of the Yangtze River, the East China region, due to the resolute implementation of Chairman Mao's instruction of "develop production, ensure supply," and the implementation of land reform, relying on liberated peasants, generated unparalleled power to support the war. It is estimated that the people of East China contributed approximately 4 billion catties of public grain annually, and the number of civilian laborers mobilized sometimes exceeded hundreds of thousands or even millions. At the same time, due to actively supporting agricultural and handicraft production and implementing a tariff policy that protected production, coupled with the vigorous implementation of the three major plans for rectification and economy put forward by the East China Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China at that time, the East China region overcame various difficulties during the most difficult period under the major offensive of the Chiang Kai-shek bandits, achieved a certain degree of self-sufficiency, guaranteed the supply for the war, and was able to transition to the great counter-offensive that began in 1947. After the counter-offensive, following Chairman Mao's urban policy, we smoothly took over and restored the production of cities such as Weixian and Jinan, vigorously supported the Huaihai Campaign, and fully prepared for the Yangtze River crossing operation.

　　Gradual Improvement of Public and Private Enterprises, Enhancing the Exchange of Goods Between Urban and Rural Areas

Regarding the work from April of last year when the Yangtze River was crossed to the end of the year, Vice Chairman Zeng reported one by one on the most important seven tasks: raising military grain in the early stages of the crossing, taking over Kuomintang bureaucratic capital enterprises and rapidly restoring production, supporting private industrial and commercial enterprises, establishing the position of the Renminbi in the new areas, cracking down on financial speculation, vigorously restoring inland transportation to strengthen urban-rural exchanges, and striving to rescue from severe floods, and financial revenues and expenditures. Among them, regarding urban industry and commerce, various effective support measures were taken, such as private industries in Shanghai, which showed improvement from September of last year; however, due to the enemy's blockade, the supply of industrial raw materials was insufficient, coupled with the impact of price fluctuations, since November, the production of some factories in Shanghai gradually declined. Another reason for this situation was the evasion of some capital and poor management. When Shanghai's money market was extraordinarily tight in December, affecting production, the People's Bank of China released purchasing loans, acceptance bills, and other loans totaling approximately 130 billion yuan, resolving the difficulties of many factories. In terms of urban-rural exchanges, large quantities of grain and coal needed by major cities were supplied and could be stored. For the two special products of silk and tea in the East China New Area, the trade company purchased more than 324,000 dan, appropriately solving the difficulties of silk and tea producers. In the figures for fiscal revenue, rural public grain was the main source during this period, with urban burdens accounting for only one-third of rural burdens; in terms of expenditure, revenue and expenditure could not be balanced due to huge war needs. During this period, the people's government used its greatest strength to rescue from severe disasters. Due to the destruction of the Kuomintang war and long-term disrepair of rivers, East China suffered from floods, droughts, insects, and wind disasters last year. Shandong, northern Anhui, and northern Jiangsu were particularly severe. The total area of flooded land in the region was more than 54.4 million mu, the total population affected by the disaster was more than 16.6 million, and there were approximately 6.6 million famine victims. Through the full rescue efforts of party, government, military, and civilian personnel in various places, more than 34 million mu of land and more than 11 million people were relieved of the disaster. The rescue efforts used more than 100 million catties of public grain and tens of billions of yuan in Renminbi, mobilizing manpower of up to more than 20 million workdays.

　　Next, Vice Chairman Zeng put forward nine specific tasks for East China's financial and economic work in 1950:

　　Supporting the War to Liberate Taiwan and Guaranteeing the Completion of the Public Bond Task

　　1. Under the unified deployment of the Central People's Government, prepare to mobilize all manpower, material resources, and financial resources to support the war to liberate Taiwan and other islands, and guarantee the complete victory of the war. The war expenses and supplies required for this battle will be particularly huge, and the new areas of Fujian and Zhejiang, as the war front, will have an even heavier task of supplying grain and civilian laborers locally. Vice Chairman Zeng especially pointed out that this is our most urgent and important task today. He called on the broad masses of people in the new areas south of the Yangtze River to cooperate with the people in the old liberated areas in contributing everything to support the front line, just as they did in the past three years of the Liberation War, to overcome various difficulties and mobilize the strength of people from all walks of life to ensure the completion of the task.

　　2. Ensure the complete fulfillment of the tasks of collecting public grain and taxes assigned to East China by the Central Financial and Economic Commission this year, and complete the public bond task on schedule, in order to cooperate with the whole country in overcoming this year's financial difficulties. In terms of expenditure, strictly abide by the budget amount approved by the higher authorities. In terms of the financial system, rapidly achieve financial unification and ensure the unified scheduling of the central government.

　　3. Actively transform and strengthen state-owned enterprises, and effectively protect private industrial and commercial enterprises that are beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood, so that they can gradually recover and develop. It should be emphasized that the industry and commerce of East China, especially Shanghai, whether state-owned or private, will still face a difficult period under the imperialist and Kuomintang blockade. Although other regions across the country are constantly supporting Shanghai with grain and cotton, the main reliance is still on the unity of the people and government of all sectors in East China to jointly overcome this difficulty.

　　Water Conservancy Improvement and Agricultural Improvement: Grain Production Should Increase by 3.2 Billion Catties This Year

　　4. Vigorously develop water conservancy. The funding for the eleven water conservancy projects in East China has been approved by the Ministry of Water Resources of the Central People's Government. The main ones include four projects such as the diversion of the Yi River in Shandong and the diversion of the Shu River in northern Jiangsu, which have now shortened the original completion period and are actively under construction.

　　5. Implement the tasks assigned to East China by the National Agricultural Conference and actively improve agriculture. This year, grain production should increase by 3.2 billion catties, jute by 600,000 dan, and cotton fields should be expanded to 15.2 million mu, with an increase in ginned cotton production to 3.8 million dan. The agricultural funds and grain approved by the Ministry of Agriculture of the Central Government for East China must be correctly used for farmland water conservancy, disease and insect control equipment, improved varieties, manufacturing agricultural tools, animal epidemic prevention, and agricultural loans to ensure the completion of the production increase task.

　　Improve Trade Institutions and Develop Transportation

　　6. Improve trade institutions, strengthen leadership in trade work, expand the exchange of goods between urban and rural areas, organize a large number of daily necessities for the people to go to the countryside, and promptly purchase agricultural products such as grain, cotton, tobacco leaves, silkworm cocoons, and tea. In particular, the Ministry of Trade and the Grain Bureau should take practical responsibility for transferring rice from the public grain of East China to the Shanghai-Nanjing line to ensure urban supply, and strive to complete the allocation plan for yarn, cloth, grain, and cotton with brother regions.

　　7. Develop deposits, encourage savings, and facilitate overseas remittances. For this reason, it is also necessary to correctly adjust interest rates and severely crack down on various speculative activities. At the same time, strengthen foreign exchange management, encourage product exports, and purchase essential machinery and industrial raw materials for production.

　　8. Under the unified plan of the Central People's Government, continue to restore and develop transportation. The main tasks are to repair and improve railway roadbeds and bridges, unite and encourage private shipping merchants to overcome current difficulties together, and assist the Ministry of Transportation of the Central People's Government in building the Pukou wharf. Highway construction will first take into account military needs this year.

　　9. Encourage and support the broad masses of working people to develop cooperative undertakings based on the principle of voluntariness. This year, in conjunction with production, disaster relief, and preparation for land reform, we should first develop supply and marketing cooperatives and consumer cooperatives, and gradually extend them to transportation, credit, production, and other cooperatives.

　　Vice Chairman Zeng concluded his report with confidence: "The establishment of the East China Military and Political Committee under orders will further expand and consolidate the unity of the people of all strata in East China. I am deeply convinced that the people of East China will be united with the people of the whole country, and under the unified leadership of the Central People's Government, we will overcome the current financial and economic difficulties, victoriously support the sacred war to liberate Taiwan and liberate all of China, thoroughly smash the enemy's blockade, and gradually restore and strengthen the East China economy."

　　曾山副主席报告华东财经工作
    准备力量支援解放台湾  积极改造壮大国营企业
    【新华社上海五日电】华东军政委员会副主席曾山在华东军政委员会第一次会议上，报告华东财政经济工作情况及今后的任务。曾副主席综述一九四七年蒋匪向山东重点进攻时起，迄华东大陆全部解放的一九四九年年底为止的主要工作情况说：在渡江以前，华东区由于坚决执行了毛主席“发展生产，保证供给”的指示，贯彻土地改革，依靠翻身农民，产生了无比的支援战争的力量。计全华东人民每年献出约四十亿斤公粮，出动民工数额有时在数十万以至百万以上。同时，由于积极扶助农业和手工业生产，实行了保护生产的关税政策，再加厉行中共中央华东局当时提出的整编节约三大方案的结果，华东区在蒋匪重点进攻下的最艰难时期中，克服了各种困难，达到了一定程度的自给自足，保证了战争的供给，并能转入一九四七年开始的大反攻。反攻后，遵照毛主席的城市政策，顺利接管与恢复潍县、济南等城市的生产，大力支援淮海歼灭战，并充分准备了渡江作战。
    公私企业逐步好转  增进城乡物资交流
    关于去年四月渡江至年底的工作，曾副主席逐一报告了渡江初期的筹借军粮，接收国民党官僚资本企业并迅速恢复生产，扶助私营工商业，确立人民币在新区的阵地，和取缔金融投机活动，大力恢复内地交通以加强城乡交流，努力抢救严重水灾，财政收支等最主要的七项工作。其中，关于城市工商业方面，由于采取了各种有效扶助办法，如上海的私营工业，去年九月份起都呈好转；但由于敌人的封锁，工业原料不能充分供应，再加物价波动的影响，自十一月以后，上海一部分工厂生产有逐渐下降现象。这种情况的另一原因，则由于部分资金的逃避和经营不善所致。去年十二月上海银根奇紧影响生产时，人民银行曾放出购货款及承兑票据和其他贷款共约一千三百亿元，解决了不少工厂的困难。城乡交流方面，各大城市所需的粮、煤都有大量供应且能存储。对华东新区丝和茶两项特产，贸易公司曾收购三十二万四千余担，适当解决了丝、茶产民的困难。在财政收入的数字中，这一时期主要依靠了农村的公粮，城市负担仅及农村负担的三分之一；支出方面，由于战争需要巨大，收支还不能平衡。这一时期内人民政府对严重的灾荒曾以最大的力量加以抢救。由于国民党战争的破坏及江河年久失修，去年华东各地均遭水、旱、虫、风等灾，山东、皖北、苏北特别严重，全区受淹土地五千四百余万亩，受灾人口总数一千六百余万，饥民约六百余万。经各地党政军民全力抢救，三千余万亩土地和一千一百余万人减轻了灾害。抢救中共用去公粮一亿余斤和人民币数十亿元，动员人力达二千余万工。
    接着，曾副主席提出了一九五零年华东财政经济工作的九项具体任务：
    支援解放台湾战争  保证完成公债任务
    一、在中央人民政府统一部署下，准备动员一切人力、物力、财力来支援解放台湾等岛屿的战争，保证战争的彻底胜利。这一战役所需的战费和供应将是特别巨大的，闽、浙新区为战争前方，就地供应粮草和民工的任务必更繁重。曾副主席特别指出，这是我们今天最迫切、最重要的任务。他号召江南广大新区人民，要和老解放区人民在过去三年多解放战争中供献一切支援前线一样，同心协力，克服各种困难，动员各阶层人民的力量来保证任务的完成。
    二、确实保证全部完成中央财政经济委员会规定给华东的今年应征公粮、税收的任务和如期完成公债任务，以配合全国共渡今年财政困难。支出方面，严格遵守上级批准的预算数目支付。在财政制度上迅速实现财政统一，保证中央的统一调度。
    三、积极改造和壮大国营企业，切实保护有利于国计民生的私营工商业，使其逐渐恢复和发展。应着重指出，华东特别是上海的工商业，不论国营或私营，在帝国主义和国民党封锁情况下，还有一个困难时期。虽然全国其他地区不断地以粮棉支援上海，但主要的仍有赖华东各界人民与政府团结一致，共同克服这个困难。
  兴修水利改进农业  今年要增产粮食卅二亿斤
    四、大力兴修水利，华东十一项水利工程经费已经中央人民政府水利部批准。其中主要的有山东导沂、苏北导沭等四项工程，现已缩短原定完成期限积极动工。
    五、执行全国农业会议给予华东的任务，积极改进农业。今年要增产粮食三十二亿斤，黄麻六十万担，并扩大棉田至一、五二○万亩，增产皮花至三百八十万担。中央农业部批准华东农业资金粮，必须正确用于农田水利、病虫药械、改良品种、制造农具、兽疫防治、举办农贷等方面，保证完成增产任务。
    健全贸易机构  发展交通事业
    六、健全贸易机构，加强贸易工作领导，展开城乡物资交流，组织大量人民日用品下乡，及时收购粮食、棉花、烟叶、丝茧、茶等农产品。特别是贸易部与粮食局，应切实负责，从华东公粮中调运大米到沪、宁线来保证城市供应，并努力完成与各兄弟地区之间的纱布粮棉的调拨计划。
    七、开展存款，鼓励储蓄，便利侨汇。为此还必须正确调整利率，严厉取缔各种投机活动。同时加强外汇管理，鼓励产品出口，购进生产必需的机器和工业原料。
    八、在中央人民政府统一计划下，继续恢复和发展交通事业。主要为修补和改善铁路路基及桥梁，团结和勉励私营航商共渡目前困难，协助中央人民政府交通部修建浦口码头，公路建设今年首先照顾军事需要。
    九、鼓励和扶助广大劳动人民，根据自愿原则，发展合作事业。今年应配合生产救灾和准备土地改革，首先发展供销合作社及消费合作社，逐渐推及于运输、信用、生产等合作社。
    曾副主席充满信心地结束他的报告说：“华东军政委员会奉命成立，华东各阶层人民的团结将更扩大和巩固。我深信华东人民必能与全国人民一致，在中央人民政府统一领导下，克服当前财政经济困难，胜利地支援解放台湾，解放全中国的神圣战争，彻底粉碎敌人的封锁，使华东经济逐渐恢复和壮大起来。”
