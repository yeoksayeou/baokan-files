The Specific Tasks of the League Moving Forward: To Act as a Shock Brigade in Production and Construction, to Publicize Economic Policies Through Practical Actions, and to Study Science and Technology.

The work of the Communist Youth League in Hebei Province has seen great development. As of November of last year, it had 181,261 members and 9,450 branches. In areas where the League has been established, members have become powerful assistants to the Party and government, playing an active leading role in various tasks; and with League members as the core, they have united, organized, and educated some young people. Due to the increased awareness of League members, many have joined the Party, enabling the League to begin playing the role of the Party's reserve force. The development of the League in various regions has generally gone through two stages: initial pilot programs and key construction. It is currently in the stage of development from point to surface. During this development, cadres have also been trained and cultivated. These cadres have been considerably tempered in their work and have gained preliminary experience. Most cadres have learned League building work. Despite the above achievements and gains, there are still many shortcomings: the number of League members is still small, the quality and quantity of youth work cadres are insufficient, and there is a lack of experience in League work. The League's leadership lags far behind the needs of the work. Many League members urgently need to study, but there are few materials available for study; League members urgently hope for leadership from above, but the leadership structure is unsound, lacking necessary systems and a hard-working and in-depth style, failing to meet the needs of League members. From the perspective of the League's work and activities, the League's relationship with the broad masses of young people is not close enough, and there is even a phenomenon of being divorced from the masses. Many progressive young people have not yet joined the League. Some League meetings and activities do not allow young people to participate. Others do not absorb League members according to the conditions stipulated in the League Constitution, but add some inappropriate conditions. Inner-League life is not democratic enough, and in some places, there have been phenomena of coercion and commandism, failing to care about the vital needs of League members and the young masses. Some League members also have closed-doorism phenomena, only satisfied with their own isolated exemplary role and not leading the masses. These shortcomings have generally been transformed through several meetings from top to bottom to carry out education in ideology and organization, and must continue to be overcome in the future.

In order to organize and mobilize the vast number of young people in the province to actively participate in economic and cultural construction, the Hebei Provincial Working Committee of the Communist Youth League has determined the specific tasks and roles that League organizations at all levels and League members should play.

In economic construction: First, play the role of an active participant. The League must become a shock brigade in production and construction, and organize and mobilize the vast number of young people to actively participate in production (paying attention to mobilizing young women). In rural areas, the League should use League members as the backbone, and unite and organize the vast number of young people to actively carry out mutual aid and cooperation together with adults. For some independent youth mutual aid organizations that are consistent with the interests of family production, leadership should be strengthened; such organizations need to develop towards youth and adult mixed mutual aid, and guide them to gradually develop in this direction. In factories, carry out youth production competitions and elect heroes and model workers to mobilize young people to actively participate in production. Taking improving quality, improving technology, and making inventions and creations as important content of this movement. Mobilize League members to formulate collective and individual production plans under the overall production plan, and promptly check and summarize their implementation.

Second, play the role of an active propagandist. Publicize economic policies and the direction of rural economic development, dispel farmers' ideological concerns, and encourage them to work hard in production and become prosperous; and publicize new scientific production knowledge, break farmers' conservative thinking in production, and adopt scientific production methods. The most effective method of propaganda is for League members and young people to take the lead and influence the masses through practical actions.

Third, lead and organize young people to study science, improve, and master technology. The methods of learning: factories can carry out movements to respect teachers and love apprentices, organize amateur technical schools or research societies, etc.; rural youth can organize production knowledge learning groups (combined with labor exchange teams), and organize production experience seminars with adult farmers and old farmers to learn from old farmers.

The current task of the League in disaster areas is to do everything possible and use all forces to lead the vast number of young people to rise up to help themselves and overcome the severe disaster. Model cadres, model League branches, model League members, and model youths in last year's production and disaster relief efforts should be commended and encouraged. League members and young people in non-disaster areas should actively help disaster areas and vigorously prepare to launch this year's large-scale production campaign.

　　全省团员已达十八万名成为党与政府有力助手
    今后团的具体任务：作生产建设中的突击队，以实际行动宣传经济政策，学习科学技术。
    河北省青年团工作已有很大发展，截至去年十一月止，已拥有团员一八一、二六一名，团支部九、四五○个。已建团的地方，团员已成为党与政府的有力助手，在各种工作中起了积极带头作用；并以团员为核心，团结组织并教育了一些青年。由于团员觉悟的提高，已有不少团员加入了党，使团开始起到党的后备军的作用。各地团的发展，一般经过了初期试办与重点建团两阶段，目前正处在由点到面的发展阶段。在发展当中，同时也训练培养了干部，这些干部在工作中得到相当锻炼，取得了初步经验。大部干部学会了建团工作。虽有上述成绩与收获，但还存在着不少缺点：团员数量还很少，青年工作干部质量数量均不够，更缺乏团的工作经验。团的领导远跟不上工作需要。很多团员迫切要求学习，而可供学习的材料很少；团员迫切希望上级的领导，但领导机构不健全，缺乏必要制度与艰苦深入的作风，不能满足团员要求。从团的工作与活动上看，团与广大青年关系还不够密切，甚至还存在着脱离群众的现象，许多进步青年还没有入团。有些团的会议，团的活动，不让青年参加。还有的不按团章规定的条件吸收团员，而另加一些不适当的条件。团内生活不够民主，个别地方曾发生强迫命令，不关心团员及青年群众切身要求的现象。有些团员还有只满足自己孤立的模范作用，不去带动群众等关门主义现象。这些缺点，经过几次会议自上而下地从思想上组织上进行教育，一般地有了转变，今后还须继续克服。
    为组织发动全省广大青年积极参加经济建设和文化建设，青年团河北省工委会确定了各级团的组织与团员的具体任务和应发挥的作用。
    在经济建设中，第一、起积极参加者的作用。团要成为生产建设中的一支突击队，并组织发动广大青年积极参加生产（注意发动青年妇女）。农村团以团员为骨干，并团结组织广大青年群众，和成年一道积极开展变工合作。对于与家庭生产利益一致的一些单独青年互助组织，要加强领导；这种组织是需要向青壮年混合变工发展的，领导他们向这方面逐渐发展。在工厂开展青年生产竞赛、评选英雄模范运动，以发动青年积极参加生产。把提高质量，提高技术，发明创造，作为此运动的重要内容。发动团员在总的生产计划下，制订团体的与个人的生产计划，并及时检查、总结其执行情况。
    第二、起积极宣传者的作用。宣传经济政策与农村经济发展方向，打破农民思想顾虑，使其努力生产，发家致富；并宣传新的科学生产知识，打破农民在生产上的保守思想，采用科学的生产方法。而最有效的宣传方法，是团员与青年带头，以实际行动影响群众。
    第三、领导与组织青年学习科学，提高和掌握技术。学习的方法，工厂可开展尊师爱徒运动，组织业余技术学校或研究会等；农村青年可组织生产知识学习小组（与拨工组结合），与壮年农民、老农一起组织生产经验座谈会等，向老农学习。
    当前灾区团的任务，是尽一切可能，用一切力量，领导广大青年奋起自救，战胜严重灾荒。去年生产救灾中的模范干部、模范团支部、模范团员与模范青年，应给以表扬与鼓励。非灾区团员与青年，应积极帮助灾区，并大力准备开展今年的大生产运动。
