[This is a report] from our newspaper:

    Yang Xiufeng, Chairman of the Hebei Provincial People's Government, who is currently inspecting the disaster situation and checking on production and disaster relief work in the severely affected areas of Ninghe, Baodi, Yutian, and Jixian in eastern Hebei, told reporters: The disaster situation in Ning, Bao, Ji, and Yu counties is serious, but there is a way to overcome it. He said that the current situation is just as Chairman Mao said: "There are difficulties, there are solutions, and there is hope." After seeing this affected area of hundreds of miles, we deeply understand that the difficulties faced by the disaster-stricken people are quite serious. We must go deep among the masses and use our existing strength to find all possible ways to help them overcome the famine. If production work is done well, it is possible to successfully overcome the famine. He emphasized that we must oppose those who only mention difficulties without thinking of solutions. Past and present experiences tell us that in the issue of disaster relief, there is no other way than to find ways to engage in production. It is unsuccessful to simply sit and eat, waiting for relief, or to think of "eating one's fill in one bite" when talking about organizing production. Chairman Yang said: Relief grain should be regarded as production grain, turning dead money into living money. The views of some cadres of granting favors and relying on relief are being corrected, which will shorten the disaster period. Leading the masses in production for self-help is a meticulous task of investigation and research and arduous mobilization and persuasion, which must be thoroughly implemented from door to door. Start from small things, budget carefully, and find more avenues for production. In this regard, there are already good examples. In Ailin Village, I heard the report of the local working group. The cadres had a fairly clear understanding of the situation of each household near the village, how to carry out production, and how much grain was lacking. This will ensure that our relief loans are used properly. However, some comrades still make "approximate" and "general" estimates of the disaster situation, which will make our relief and production organization work fall flat, remaining at the level of appeals and slogans.

    Chairman Yang also emphasized that in production for self-help, the issue of organizational leadership is the main key to doing a good job. We must organize all our strength and invest it in production. We are already one step behind in this year's production and disaster relief. The provincial government and governments at all levels should review this and be responsible for it. If we want to guide the masses to do a good job in production, we must learn production knowledge, we must learn from the masses, and rely on the masses. Otherwise, there is no way to lead the masses in production to overcome the famine.

    Chairman Yang also proposed strengthening epidemic prevention work in the disaster area. The provincial government has now organized medical teams to go to various disaster areas for epidemic prevention to avoid adding disaster upon disaster for the masses in the disaster areas.

### 杨秀峰主席在灾区告记者：一定有办法战胜灾荒  要面对困难了解情况精打细算  把救济粮作本钱组织群众生产

　　杨秀峰主席在灾区告记者：
    一定有办法战胜灾荒
    要面对困难了解情况精打细算  把救济粮作本钱组织群众生产
    【本报讯】刻正在冀东之宁河、宝坻、玉田、蓟县重灾区视察灾情，检查生产救灾工作的河北省人民政府杨秀峰主席告记者称：宁、宝、蓟、玉四县的灾情是严重的，但是有办法渡过的。他说，目前的情况正如毛主席所说的：“有困难，有办法，有希望”。在看过这方圆数百里的潺区之后，深刻了解灾胞遭受的困难是相当严重的，我们必须深入群众，以现有的力量，想出一切办法使他们渡过灾荒。如果生产工作作得好，是可能胜利渡过灾荒的。他着重指出：必须反对那种光提困难不想办法的人。过去的，现在的经验都告诉我们，在救灾这一问题上，除想办法搞生产以外别无他法。只是坐吃山空，等待救济，或一谈组织生产便想“一口吃饱”都是不成功的。杨主席说：要把救灾粮当为生产粮，变死财为活财。某些干部存在着的恩赐、救济观点正在纠正，这将会缩短灾期。领导群众生产自救，原是一种细致的调查研究与艰苦的动员说服的工作，必须挨门逐户深入贯彻。从小处着手，精打细算，多找生产门路。在这方面，已经有了好的例子。在艾林庄我听到了该地工作组的报告，干部对该村附近每家情况及如何进行生产、缺多少粮都了解得相当清楚。这样才能使我们的赈贷粮食运用的得当。但有的同志还是对灾情作“大约”“一般”的估计，这样就会使我们的救济与组织生产工作落空，停留在号召与口号上。
    杨主席又着重的提出，在生产自救中，组织领导问题是作好工作的主要关键，我们一定要将所有的力量组织起来投入生产。在今年的生产救灾上我们已经晚了一步，省府与各级政府都应检讨，都应对此负责。我们想指导群众搞好生产，必须学习生产知识，必须向群众学习，依靠群众，否则就没法领导群众生产渡过灾荒。
    杨主席还提出在灾区要加强防疫工作。现在省府已经组织了医疗队分赴各灾区防疫，以避免灾区的群众灾上加灾。
