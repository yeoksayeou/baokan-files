　　Continue to Transform New District Middle Schools Summarize Old Liberated Area Education Experiences
　　Hebei Secondary Education Conference Determines Policy

　　[This newspaper reports] The Hebei Provincial Department of Education recently convened a provincial secondary education conference. Based on the instructions of the Ministry of Education and the province's national economic situation, the conference determined that this year's secondary education work in the province will focus on consolidation and improvement, striving for appropriate development under possible conditions. The specific approach is to continue rectifying and transforming schools in the new districts, focusing on strengthening the political and ideological education of teachers and students, thereby further improving teaching. Schools in the old liberated areas will focus on improving teaching effectiveness, paying attention to summarizing experiences, and laying the foundation for the upcoming development. At the same time, earnestly run cadre cultural refresher courses; pilot run worker-peasant rapid middle schools to prepare conditions for the development of worker-peasant rapid education in the second half of the year; and pay attention to the enrollment of children of workers and peasants. Industrial areas can specially set up worker children's middle schools or worker children's classes under possible conditions. In addition, the conference determined that secondary education should pay attention to developing towards secondary technical schools in the future; teacher training schools should plan to enroll more female students.

　　Overcome Two Deviations: Underestimating Political Ideological Education and Teaching Detached from Reality

　　After more than a year of rectification and transformation, secondary education in the province has achieved considerable success and progress. The current problems and shortcomings are, first of all, that many teachers neglect political and ideological education for students. This phenomenon is more serious and widespread in the new districts. Secondly, teaching is detached from reality. The phenomenon of teachers copying textbooks and students rote learning exists to varying degrees. Teachers and students in the new districts have not transformed enough from old traditions; after correcting excessive social activities and productive labor in schools in the old liberated areas, some have also developed a tendency to "not ask about world affairs, only read cultural books." In addition, both new and old district schools do not pay enough attention to students' health issues. Some only pay attention to form and not to actual effect.

　　Sun Wenshu, Director of the Hebei Provincial Department of Education, pointed out in her concluding remarks at the conference: "There are many reasons for the formation of the above shortcomings, and the main ideological obstacle is the remnants of old education ideas." She explained that "the two deviations of neglecting political ideological education and theory being detached from reality are stubborn enemies of implementing new democracy education and must be vigorously fought against." And "the basic key to overcoming the above deviations lies in improving the political and ideological level of faculty and staff, and improving the professional level on this basis." It is necessary to strengthen the study of on-the-job teachers; study the guidelines of new education; analyze and criticize old ideas and old education, discard their reactionary parts and take their useful parts; summarize and improve the implementation experience of new democracy education to adapt it to the new environment of peaceful construction; and especially study the advanced experience of Soviet education construction. At the same time, she asked all schools to pay practical attention to and improve students' health education. Conduct sex education for students in conjunction with physiology and hygiene classes; conduct women's hygiene education for female students. Schools with female students should try to hire female faculty and staff to facilitate life guidance. Advocate correct sports activities, overcome the harmful formalism and unhealthy championshipism of the old formalism. Overcome the unhygienic habits of rural students. Oppose the attitude of not caring about students' lives or excessively emphasizing the difficulty of material conditions without trying to overcome them. In the future, all schools must promptly check and summarize students' health exercises, make achievements, and list them as part of the report content.

　　继续改造新区中学  总结老区教育经验
    河北中等教育会议确定方针
    【本报讯】河北省教育厅最近召开了全省中等教育会议。会议根据教育部指示及该省国民经济情况，确定了该省本年中等教育工作以巩固与提高为主；在可能条件下争取适当的发展。具体作法是继续整顿与改造新区学校，侧重加强教师和学生的政治思想教育，从而进一步改进教学。老区学校则着重提高教学效果，注意总结经验，为行将到来的发展打下基础。同时，认真办好干部文化补习班；试办工农速成中学，为下半年发展工农速成教育准备条件；并注意工农子女入学问题，工业区在可能条件下可专设工人子弟中学或工人子弟班。此外，会议确定今后中等教育应注意向中等技术学校发展；师范学校应有计划地多收女生。
            克服轻视政治思想教育与教学脱离实际两偏向
    该省中等教育经一年多的整顿、改造之后，已获得相当成绩和进步。目前存在的问题与缺点，首先是不少教员忽视对学生的政治思想教育。这种现象在新区较为严重和普遍。其次是在教学上的脱离实际。教员照搬课本和学生读死书的现象或多或少存在着。新区师生对旧传统的转变不够；老区学校在纠正过多的社会活动与生产劳动之后，有的也产生“不问天下事，只读文化书”的倾向。此外，对学生的健康问题，新老区学校多是重视不足。有的只注意形式，未注意实效。
    河北省教育厅孙文淑厅长在会议总结中指出：“形成以上缺点的原因甚多，其主要的思想障碍则是旧教育思想作祟。”她说明“忽视政治思想教育与理论脱离实际的两种偏向，是实施新民主主义教育的顽强的敌人，必须大力与之进行斗争。”而“克服以上偏向的基本关键在于提高教职员的政治思想水平，在此基础上提高业务水平”。必须加强在职教员学习；研究新教育的方针；分析批判旧思想旧教育，去其反动部分取其有用部分；总结新民主主义教育实施经验并加以提高，使之适应新的和平建设环境；特别要学习苏联教育建设的先进经验。同时，她要求各校切实注意并改进学生的健康教育。结合生理卫生课对学生进行性教育；对女生进行妇女卫生教育。有女生的学校应尽量聘请女教职员，以便于生活的指导。提倡正确的体育活动，克服旧的形式主义的有害身心健康的锦标主义。克服农村学生不讲卫生的习惯。反对对学生生活不关心或过分强调物质条件困难不去想法克服的态度。今后各校对学生健康锻炼须及时检查总结，做出成绩，并列为报告内容之一。
