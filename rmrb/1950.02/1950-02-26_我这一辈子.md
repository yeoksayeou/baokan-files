　　"This Life of Mine"
　　Yu Qiexing
　　A sixty-something Beijing man, who started as a patrolman at twenty, from the end of the Qing Dynasty, through the Xinhai Revolution, Yuan Shikai's attempt to become emperor, the May Fourth Movement, the September 18th Incident, the July 7th Incident, until the victory of the War of Resistance against Japan and the Japanese surrender, with Beijing changing hands several times, he still managed to do his "stinky-feet patrolman" job, muddle-headedly serving those several "masters" for a lifetime. He lived a miserable life for more than forty years, ending up with his family ruined and killed, and finally, because his son joined the People's Liberation Army, he was dismissed from his post, tortured on the tiger bench, had cold water poured on him, and was thrown into prison. In prison, he met Mr. Sun, a representative of Peking University in the May Fourth Movement—a communist, who told him the root of his "life's" suffering. He began to truly hate the reactionary ruling class, with tears in his eyes, clenching his fist, angrily cursing: "Damn their mothers and grandmothers!" After getting out of prison, under the bayonets of the Kuomintang reactionaries, he dug trenches, hoping for the People's Liberation Army, thinking of his son in the revolutionary ranks. But he did not wait for liberation, and fell in the snowy night, hungry and cold, ending "this life of mine."

　　Law-abiding, honest, and kind Chinese people, under the layers of exploitation and heavy oppression in the changing dynasties of "this life," encountered a miserable life, truly "good people do not have good lives." Fifty years of feudal and fascist dictatorship, and imperialist aggression, put heavy shackles on the Chinese people. "Law-abiding" only requires the people to abide; the reactionary rulers can be lawless. Under the butcher's knife of the reactionary rulers, the people lived a miserable and unjust life, becoming slaves without even knowing they were slaves. The savior of the Chinese people, the Chinese Communist Party, has led the people in fighting against the reactionary ruling class for twenty-eight years, and finally won the victory of the new democratic revolution against imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism, building a democratic, independent, and free New China, ending the tragic and painful "life" of the Chinese people.

　　It is very meaningful to screen "This Life of Mine" during the first Spring Festival of the people's victory. This can allow us to recall the old life, settle old scores, end a muddled life, closely follow the Communist Party, truly take on the responsibility of being the master of the country, and start a new life that will be better generation after generation.

　　“我这一辈子”
　　余且行
    一个六十多岁的北京人，从二十岁起就干巡警，从满清末年起，经过辛亥革命、袁世凯称皇上、五四运动、九一八、七七事变、直到抗战胜利日本投降，北京城来回地换了几个主儿，他还是凑合着干他的“臭脚巡”，稀里糊涂的替那几个“主儿”凑合着服务了一辈子。他过了四十多年的悲惨生活，结果落到个家破人亡，最后还因为他儿子参加了人民解放军，被撤了职，并且坐了老虎凳，灌过凉水，关进监牢里。在监牢里他遇见了五四运动北大代表孙先生——一个共产党员，告诉他“这一辈子”苦难的根源，他开始对反动统治阶级真正的愤恨了，噙着泪，捏紧了拳头，怒骂着：“操他的亲娘祖奶奶！”从监牢里出来后，他在国民党反动派的刺刀胁迫下挖着战壕，盼望着解放军，想念着在革命队伍里的儿子。但他没有等到解放，却已在饥寒交迫下，跌倒在雪夜里，结束了“这一辈子”。
    奉“公”守“法”，安份守己，善良的中国人民，在“这一辈子”改朝换代的层层剥削，重重压迫之下，所遭遇的生活是够惨的，真是“好人不得好活”。五十年来的封建的、法西斯的独裁，帝国主义的侵略，给中国人民套上了深重的枷锁。奉“公”守“法”只是要人民去奉守；反动统治者可以无法无天。在反动统治者屠刀之下，人民悲惨而冤屈地过了一辈子，当了奴才还不知道自己是奴才。中国人民的救星中国共产党，二十八年来领导着人民向反动统治阶级斗争，终于获得了反帝、反封建、反官僚资本主义的新民主主义革命的胜利，建设了民主、独立、自由的新中国，结束了中国人民悲惨苦难的“这一辈子”。
    在人民胜利的第一个春节，放映《我这一辈子》是很有意义的。这可以使我们回忆一下旧的生活，算清旧账，结束稀里糊涂的一辈子，紧跟着共产党，真正担当起国家的主人的担子，要一代好一代的开始新的一辈子。
