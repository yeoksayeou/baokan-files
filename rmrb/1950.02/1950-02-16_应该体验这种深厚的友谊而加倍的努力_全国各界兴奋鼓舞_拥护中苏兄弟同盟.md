Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 15th -- Guo Moruo, Chairman of the National Committee of the All-China Federation of Literary and Art Circles, recently issued a statement on the signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance and the other two agreements, saying:

    The Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance has been signed.

    We should thank Marshal Stalin and Chairman Mao Zedong. It is these two giants who have embodied the brotherly friendship between the two great nations of China and the Soviet Union, bringing exciting and encouraging news to peace-loving people all over the world.

    The main purpose of the treaty is to jointly prevent the revival of Japanese imperialism, to jointly prevent any imperialist collusion with Japan in aggression, and to jointly safeguard lasting world peace. This main purpose is extremely solemn. The two great nations of China and the Soviet Union have sufficient strength and confidence to accomplish these tasks.

    The importance of the treaty cannot be praised enough. It is different from any other existing treaty. Its importance lies not only in the text itself, but even more in the spirit of the treaty. The friendly mutual assistance between the two great nations of China and the Soviet Union has long been a fact, and the treaty has made this fact a written document. Therefore, along with the conclusion of the treaty, there is further friendly mutual assistance, embodied in various agreements.

    A loan with an annual interest rate of one percent is unprecedented. The unconditional return of the Chinese Changchun Railway to China, and the withdrawal of troops from Lushun and Dalian, are even more unimaginable to imperialists. The issues of the Chinese Changchun Railway and Lushun-Dalian have always been a knot that is difficult to untie for some deceived friends, but from today onwards, this knot can finally be untied.

    The treaty is about "mutual assistance," but today, the Soviet Union is helping us more, and this is something we should be especially grateful for. We should experience this profound friendship and redouble our efforts to quickly eliminate the remaining reactionary forces and quickly restore the serious wounds of war, so that we can make a greater contribution to the defense of lasting world peace.

    Undoubtedly, due to the signing of these treaties and agreements, the arrogant war-mongers of American imperialism and the remnants of Japanese imperialism have suffered a head-on blow! The fate of Hitler and Hideki Tojo awaits them!

　　应该体验这种深厚的友谊而加倍的努力
    全国各界兴奋鼓舞  拥护中苏兄弟同盟
    郭沫若
    【新华社北京十五日电】中华全国文学艺术界联合会全国委员会主席郭沫若顷就中苏友好同盟互助条约及其他两个协定的签订发表谈话称：
    中苏友好同盟互助条约签字了。
    我们应该感谢斯大林大元帅，感谢毛泽东主席，是他们两位巨人，把中苏两大民族的兄弟般的友谊具象化了，为全世界爱好和平的人民带来了令人欢欣鼓舞的绝好的消息。
    条约的主旨是在共同防止日本帝国主义的复活，共同防止任何帝国主义与日本相勾结的侵略阴谋，并共同保卫世界的持久和平。这主旨是异常庄严的。中苏两大民族有充分的力量和信心，来完成这些任务。
    条约的重要性是颂扬不尽的。它不同于其它任何既成的条约。它的重要性不仅在于条文本身，而更在于条约的精神。中苏两大民族的友好互助早就是事实，条约是把这事实成文化了。故与条约缔结同时，便有更进一步的友好互助，体现在各个协定里面。
    年利一分的大借款，这是从来所没有的事。中长路的无偿交还中国，旅大的撤兵，这更是帝国主义者所梦想不到的。中长路与旅大问题对于好些受了蒙蔽的朋友，老是解不开的一个结子，从今天起总可以把这结子解开了。
    条约是“互助”，但在今天，苏联帮助我们的比重更大，这是我们所应该特别感谢的。我们应该体验这种深厚的友谊而加倍的努力，把残余的反动势力迅速消灭，把严重的战争创伤迅速恢复，那我们对于世界持久和平的保卫便会有更大的贡献了。
    无疑，由于这些条约和协定的签订，狂妄的美帝国主义的战争贩子们和日本帝国主义的残余，是痛受了当头一棒！希特勒和东条英机的命运在等着他们！
