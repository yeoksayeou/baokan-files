Xinhua News Agency, Hankou, 8th: The Central South Region Health Work Conference, currently in session, held a discussion on the issue of trying Japanese bacterial warfare criminals on the evening of the 6th. Participants unanimously supported the Soviet note's proposal to organize an international tribunal to try Japanese bacterial warfare criminals and expressed boundless anger towards the Japanese bacterial warfare criminals. Deng Yiwei, President of Xiangya Hospital, said: "On November 4, 1941, when Japanese planes scattered items containing plague bacteria, such as grains, wheat, felt, cotton, and tea, in Changde, I was in Changde. At that time, the Huade Hospital in the area used sterile saline solution to precipitate and smear the grains dropped by the Japanese planes and examined them, finding bacilli. Everyone suspected they were plague bacteria. Eight days later, the first suspected patient died quickly. When the inguinal lymph nodes of the deceased were taken for smear culture, suspicious plague bacilli were found. Afterwards, residents continued to die. Examination of the deceased's lungs, spleen, liver, and lymph nodes showed hyperemia. Smears cultured from the extracted spleen, lung, and liver fluid all showed similar bacilli. The extracted fluid was then injected into two guinea pigs, and the pigs died three days later. The lungs, spleen, and liver of the dead pigs also showed hyperemia and the same bacilli, proving it to be plague bacilli. Before the outbreak, residents of Changde had found rats crawling slowly on the ground, and they could be caught with pliers, indicating that the rats had been infected with the virus. At that time, some people went to Taoyuan, causing the plague to spread to the Taoyuan area." Liu Bingyang, professor of bacteriology at Xiangya Medical College, said: "When Japan declared war on the United States and Britain, I was in the United States. The American bacteriological community had studied how to deal with the bacterial warfare that Japan might use, but instead of trying to stop the evil bacterial warfare, they studied it in order to use even more vicious bacterial warfare. They had studied how to use the Rocky Mountain spotted fever pathogen transmitted by ticks for bacterial warfare. These facts illustrate the brutal nature of imperialism." Ling Minyou, President of Xiangya Medical College, said: "We scientific medical workers and bacteriologists must study effective ways to stop the use of bacteria as weapons of war." The symposium unanimously called for severe punishment of war criminals headed by Hirohito and believed that the best way to eliminate bacterial warfare is to strengthen the unity of democratic forces and resolutely support the international peace and democracy camp headed by the Soviet Union.

　　中南区卫生工作会议
    座谈审判细菌战犯问题
    拥护苏照会要求严惩裕仁等战犯
    【新华社汉口八日电】正在举行会议的中南区卫生工作会议，于六日晚座谈审判日本细菌战犯问题。与会者一致拥护苏联照会中关于组织国际法庭审判日本细菌战犯的提议，并对日本细菌战犯表示无限愤怒。湘雅医院院长邓一韪说：一九四一年十一月四日，日机在常德散布含有鼠疫菌的谷、麦、毡、棉、茶等物时，我正在常德。当时该地华德医院用无菌生理盐水将日机投下之谷物沉淀涂片，检查出杆菌。大家疑为鼠疫菌。八日后，第一个可疑的病患者即迅速死亡。将死者腹股等处的淋巴腺取出涂片培养时，发现有可疑的鼠疫杆菌。以后居民续有死亡。检查死者肺、脾、肝、淋巴腺有充血现象。抽出其脾、肺、肝液涂片培养，均有类似的杆菌。再把抽出的液汁注射到两个荷兰猪身上，三天后猪就死了。死猪之肺、脾、肝也有充血现象及相同的杆菌，经证明确为鼠疫杆菌。在发病之前，常德居民曾发现老鼠在地下慢爬，用铁钳即能钳住，说明老鼠已染有病毒。当时有人到桃源，以致鼠疫曾蔓延到桃源地区。湘雅医学院细菌学教授刘秉阳说：当日本对美英宣战时，我正在美国。美国细菌学界曾经研究如何对付日本可能使用的细菌战，但他们不是设法制止罪恶的细菌战，而是研究它，以便使用更凶恶的细菌战。他们曾研究如何应用由壁虱传播的落?山斑点热病原体进行细菌战。这些事实，说明帝国主义凶残的本质。湘雅医学院院长凌敏犹说：我们科学医务工作者、细菌学家必研究有效的办法来制止以细菌作为战争武器。座谈会一致要求严厉惩罚以裕仁为首的战犯，并且认为消灭细菌战争的最好办法，就是加强民主力量的团结，坚决拥护以苏联为首的国际和平民主阵营。
