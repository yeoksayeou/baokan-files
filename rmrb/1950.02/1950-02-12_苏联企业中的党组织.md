　　Soviet Enterprise Party Organizations
    Keshelefu
    Editor's Note: This article systematically introduces all the activities of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (CPSU) party organizations in enterprises. It points out that the source of the party organization's strength lies in its unbreakable connection with the masses. Through the Bolshevik education of party members, by giving party members party assignments, through large-scale mass organization work, and through various forms of propaganda and mobilization, party organizations help the administration implement production tasks in each period, influence the broad masses to mobilize and organize production competitions, and ultimately achieve production plans. These Soviet experiences are urgently needed by readers in our enterprises. We hope everyone will study them carefully. As far as we know, in many enterprise-level party organizations, issues such as the tasks of factory party branches, daily work and methods, and party-mass relations have not yet been fully resolved. We hope that everyone will combine these successful Soviet experiences with our current practical work so that some of the problems we have can be well resolved.
    The Communist Party (Bolsheviks) of the Soviet Union is the leading and guiding force within the Soviet Union. The primary party organizations in various enterprises and institutions are the basic link between the millions of party members and the broad masses of working people.

    The strength of each primary party organization lies in its unbreakable connection with the masses. If a party organization in a Soviet enterprise or institution does not rely on the trust and assistance of the broad masses of working people in its activities, it will not be able to solve any practical tasks. Maintaining a solid and continuous connection with the masses is the main condition for Bolshevik party leadership.

    The Party Constitution grants party organizations in production the right to supervise the activities of enterprise management organs. Party organizations have the right to demand that management organs provide them with necessary materials regarding enterprise work. Party organizations have the right to request economic leaders to report on their work, to raise issues regarding various shortcomings hindering the implementation of plans, to propose measures to improve production work, and to report to higher-level party organizations and economic organs on the business conditions in the enterprise.

    The right of supervision obliges party organizations and their leaders to deeply understand the essence of enterprise work, study its economic situation, study the distribution of its cadres, pay attention to its production technology process, check the implementation of party and government instructions in the enterprise, and quickly correct various shortcomings in production.

    Enjoying the right of supervision does not mean replacing managers and leaders, or interfering with their actions and work. The leaders of Soviet enterprises enjoy full authority and are solely responsible to the state for the tasks they undertake. There can be no order in an enterprise without a firm system of one-man management. Primary party organizations in factories do their best to maintain the prestige of economic leaders and help them consolidate production discipline. Party organizations cannot cancel orders from the enterprise authorities, cannot remove or transfer staff, cannot demand that enterprise managers seek their approval before issuing orders; in other words, they cannot assume administrative functions themselves. Primary party organizations help the enterprise authorities implement orders by conducting mass political and organizational work among workers, engineers, technicians, and management personnel. This is one of the basic functions of party organizations. Party organizations achieve a conscious attitude of workers and staff toward labor and their active participation in the cause of communist construction through political education and by constantly explaining the tasks of socialist construction to them.

    The most obvious manifestation of the influence of party organizations is the organization and leadership of socialist competition. Millions of Soviet people participate in nationwide competitions in order to implement national economic plans as quickly as possible. Local party organizations take all measures to attract all workers to participate in socialist competitions and to widely disseminate the experience of the best producers.

    In many factories, workshop party organizations or party groups have been established, which can greatly assist the party organization in carrying out the above tasks.

    Oral propaganda is widely disseminated in Soviet enterprises. Its forms are diverse. For example: worker congresses, talks on urgent issues by propagandists, political briefings, reading newspapers in small groups of workers, and agitation conducted towards individual workers. Party organizations require each of their members to conduct political work among the people around them every day.

    The propagandists assigned by the party organization talk with the workers, inform them of current events, news about the work in the enterprise, and explain the policies of the party and the Soviet government to the masses.

    A powerful tool in the hands of primary party organizations is demonstration propaganda. Slogans and mottos, reading boards and competition results tables, honor boards and wall newspapers - all these forms, along with many other forms of propaganda, make it possible to quickly inform all employees in the enterprise of the achievements of advanced producers, explain the meaning of this or that political event, and mobilize workers to carry out important production tasks.

    In addition to propaganda, party organizations in Soviet enterprises also carry out major organizational work and lead the activities of trade unions, the Communist Youth League, and other organizations of working people. Stalin called trade unions and the Communist Youth League the connecting belts linking the party with the broad masses of working people.

    Trade union organizations do their best to launch socialist competitions, care about workers' production education and improve their skills, carry out cultural and educational work, and care about meeting the living needs of workers. The party organization monitors to ensure that all these tasks are properly resolved, that production meetings are held regularly in the enterprise, that the implementation of the socialist competition tasks undertaken by workers and staff is regularly checked, and that clubs, red corners (laborers' clubs in Soviet enterprises - editor), and other cultural and educational institutions all work well. Communists working in trade unions are responsible for all this work not only to the trade union members who elected them but also to the party organization.

    The Communist Youth League organization gives great help to the primary party organization in Soviet enterprises. The Lenin Communist Youth League has always been the Bolshevik Party's most trusted assistant and reserve force. The task of the Communist Youth League is to carry out communist education for the younger generation. All its work is carried out under the direct leadership of the Party. Local party organizations regularly guide the activities of the Communist Youth League organizations, helping them carry out training and cultural education work, organizing young people's production studies and improving their skills, and assisting and developing the production initiative of the Communist Youth League members.

    The party organization does not replace any non-party organization of workers, does not command them, but leads these organizations through the communists working in them. Communists are advanced people who enjoy great prestige among the working masses, and they use explanation and persuasion to guide the members of these organizations along the path indicated by the Communist Party.

    Every Soviet enterprise has wall newspapers, and many enterprises also publish their own newspapers. The activities of factory newspapers are led by the primary party organization. The party branch or party committee approves the editorial plan, regularly convenes research groups of wall newspaper editors and various editors, where they study the principles of Bolshevik publications, study the work forms and methods of correspondents' work, and exchange the experiences of factory publication workers.

    Primary party organizations in enterprises carry out major internal party work, the most important point of which is to conduct Bolshevik education for party members. The forms of educational work are various: political study groups, lecture meetings, and independent study of Marxist-Leninist theory by party members. Party meetings are a university for political education, where every party member has the right to criticize any staff member, participate in discussions of practical issues in party policy, and put forward their own suggestions on the issues discussed. The party organization recognizes the enormous educational significance of party meetings, so it prepares them meticulously each time.

    One of the important educational methods is the party assignment given by the party organization to each party member. Communists can develop politically and gain experience in carrying out organizational work among the masses while carrying out party assignments.

    All the work of the party organization is built on the basis of intra-party democracy. The leading organs of all party organizations are elected and report on their work to the party members and party organizations that elected them. Party members supervise party organs and examine their activities by means of party organ work reports and discussions of these reports.

    Through its daily work among the masses, the primary party organization in Soviet enterprises realizes the policies of the Bolshevik Party, which determine all the activities of the Soviet state and form the foundation of life of the Soviet system.

　　苏联企业中的党组织
    科什列夫
    编者按：这篇文章系统地介绍了苏联共产党党组织在企业中的全部活动。它指出党组织力量的源泉在于牢不可破地同群众的连系。党的组织通过对党员的布尔什维克的教育工作，通过给党员以党的委托，通过大规模的群众组织工作，通过各式各样的宣传鼓动工作来帮助行政上贯彻每一时期生产任务，影响广大群众使他们积极起来组织生产竞赛，最后实现生产计划。苏联的这些经验为我们各地企业中的读者所迫切需要。我们希望大家认真加以研究学习。据我们所知，在不少企业部门党组织中至今仍然没有完满地解决有关工厂党支部任务，日常工作及其方法，以及党群关系等方面的问题。我们希望大家把苏联的这些成功经验同我们当前的实际工作结合起来，使我们存在的一些问题能够很好地得到解决。
    苏联共产党（布尔什维克）是苏联国内的领导和指导力量。它在各企业和各机关中的初级党组织乃是苏联这个有几百万党员的党籍以和广大劳动群众发生联系的基本环节。
    每个初级党组织的力量，就在于它与群众的牢不可破的联系。苏联企业或机关中的党组织，要是在其活动中不依靠于广大劳动群众的信任与援助，那它便连任何一个实际任务也不能解决。与群众发生坚固不断的联系乃是布尔什维克党领导的主要条件。
    党章给予生产中党组织以监督企业管理机关活动的权利。党组织有权要求管理机关以关于企业工作的必要材料交给它。党组织有权要求经济领导者向它作工作报告，有权向他们提出关于障碍计划执行的各种缺点问题，提议采行这种或那种能以改善生产工作的措施，向上级党组织及经济机关作关于企业中业务状况的报告。
    监督权责成党组织及其领导者要深刻认识企业工作的实质，研究其经济情形，研究其干部分布情形，留心其生产技术过程，检查党和政府指令在企业中之执行情形，迅速纠正生产中的各种缺点。
    享受监督权并不是意味着可以代替经理领导者，可以干涉经理领导者的行动工作。苏联企业中的领导者乃是享有全权的专责，他亲自向国家对自己所担承的事业负责。企业中要是没有坚固的单一首长制，便不能有任何秩序。工厂中初级党组织尽量地维持经济领导者的威信，帮助他们巩固生产纪律。党组织不能取消企业当局的命令，不能撤销或调换工作人员，不能要求企业经理下令时须经过其同意，换句话说，不能自己担负起行政的机能。初级党组织以在工人、在工程技术人员以及管理人员中进行群众政治工作和组织工作的办法来帮助企业当局命令之执行。这便是党组织的基本机能之一。党组织经过对人员施行政治教育的办法，经过经常向他们解释社会主义建设任务的办法，来达到工人和职员对劳动的自觉态度，达到其积极参加共产主义的建设事业。
    党组织影响作用最显明的表现，便是组织和领导社会主义竞赛。千百万苏联人参加全民竞赛，以便最迅速的执行国民经济计划。各地方党组织采取一切办法来吸收全体劳动者参加社会主义竞赛，并使最优秀的生产者的经验得以广泛传播起来。
    在许多工厂中都成立有车间的党组织或党组，它们能够大大地协助党组织上述任务之执行。
    在苏联企业中口头鼓动有着广大的传播。其形式是多样的。例如：工人大会，鼓动员所作的关于迫切问题的谈话，政治通报，在不大的工人集团中进行的读报，以及向个别工人进行的鼓动。党组织要求自己的每个党员，每天都要在其周围人们中进行政治工作。
    党组织分派出来的鼓动员同工人们进行谈话，向他们通报关于目前事件的消息，关于本企业中工作的消息，向群众解释党和苏维埃政府的政策。
    初级党组织手中的强有力的工具，便是示范鼓动。标语和口号，阅报栏和竞赛结果表，荣誉板和壁报——所有这些形式连同其他许多鼓动形式，使有可能迅速地把生产中先进者的成绩告知企业内全体员工，解释这种或那种政治事件的意义，动员工人来执行重要生产任务等。
    苏联企业中的党的组织，除鼓动外还进行大的组织工作，还领导着工会、青年团及其他劳动群众组织的活动。斯大林称职工会和共产主义青年团为把党与广大劳动群众联结起来的联系带。
    职工组织尽量地发动社会主义竞赛，关心工人的生产教育和提高其熟练程度，进行文化教育工作，关心满足劳动者的生活需求。党组织监视着要使所有这一切任务都能获得正确解决，要使企业中能经常召集生产会议，经常检查工人和职员所担负的社会主义竞争任务之执行情形，要使俱乐部，红角（苏联企业中劳动者的俱乐部——编者）及其他文化教育机关都好好地工作。在职工会中作工的共产党员对这全部工作不仅要向选举他们的职工会会员负责，而且要对党组织负责。
    共产主义青年团的组织给苏维埃企业中初级党组织以大的帮助。列宁共产主义青年团始终是布尔什维克党最亲信的助手和后备军。共产主义青年团的任务是要向青年后辈进行共产主义的教育。它的这全部工作是在党直接领导之下进行的。各地方党组织经常指导着共产主义青年团组织的活动，帮助它们进行训练的和文化教育的工作，组织青年的生产学习和提高其熟练程度，援助和发展共产主义青年团员的生产首创性。
    党组织并不代替劳动者任何一种非党的组织，不指挥它们，而是经过在其中工作的共产党员来领导这些组织。共产党员是先进的人们，是在劳动群众中享有莫大威信的人们，他们经过解释和说服的办法使这些组织中的会员沿着共产党所指示的道路前进。
    每个苏维埃企业中都有壁报，而在许多企业中还出版有自己的报纸。工厂报纸的活动是由初级党组织来领导的。党支部或党委员会批准编辑部的计划，定期的召集壁报主编和各编辑的研究组，在这里研究布尔什维克出版物的原则，研究和通讯员工作的工作形式与方法，以及交换工厂刊物工作人员的经验等。
    企业中初级党组织进行着大的党内工作，这种工作最重要的一点便是对党员进行布尔什维克的教育。教育工作的形式有各种各样的：政治研究组，讲演会，党员独立研究马列主义理论。党会议是一种进行政治教育的大学校，每个党员有权在会议上批评任何一个工作人员，参加讨论党政策中的实际问题，对所讨论的问题提出自己的建议。党组织估计到党会议有巨大的教育意义，所以每一次都缜密地来准备它。
    重要教育方法之一，便是党组织给每个党员的党的委托。共产党员在执行党的委托时能在政治方面得到发展，能获得在群众中进行组织工作的锻炼。
    党组织的全部工作都建筑于党内民主基础之上。全部党组织的领导机关都是由选举产生的，他们向选举他们的党员和党组织作工作报告。党员们经过党机关工作报告和讨论这些报告的办法，来监督党机关，并检查其活动。
    苏维埃企业中初级党组织经过其在群众中进行的日常工作，而来实现布尔什维克党的政策，这种政策决定着苏维埃国家的全部活动，并组成为苏维埃制度的生命基础。
