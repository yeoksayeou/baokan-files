Beijing Municipal Bureau of Education Announces Measures
    Examining Student Performance in Secondary Schools
    [Beijing News] The Municipal Government's Bureau of Education announced the "Provisional Measures for Examining Student Performance in Beijing Secondary Schools" yesterday (the 31st). The measures stipulate that student performance is divided into two categories: academic performance in each subject and conduct. Academic performance is assessed using a 100-point system: daily performance accounts for 60%, and exam performance accounts for 40%, with the sum of the two serving as the semester grade for each subject. An overall average semester grade of 60 is considered passing. Students who fail a subject in the previous semester or were unable to take the exam due to leave will have a make-up exam within one week of the start of the following semester. If the overall average score of all subjects in the previous semester is failing, and even after the make-up exam there are still two failing grades, the student will be designated as a probationary student. Probationary students retain their formal student status during the probationary period, but if the subject they are on probation for is still failing in the following semester, they will repeat the grade. The assessment of conduct should include learning attitude, ideological style, and adherence to discipline. The assessment of conduct must adopt a democratic evaluation method, highlighting strengths, weaknesses, and opinions, with specific comments signed by the form teacher and reviewed and registered by the Dean of Studies in the student record book to facilitate ongoing assistance for improvement. These measures for examining student performance include detailed regulations for student promotion, retention, leave, absenteeism, suspension, withdrawal, and conduct assessment. While announcing these measures, the Bureau of Education also instructed all schools to use them as study material for professional development, conducting extensive discussions and education to ensure that teachers and students understand that the purpose of examining performance is to check and improve learning outcomes.
