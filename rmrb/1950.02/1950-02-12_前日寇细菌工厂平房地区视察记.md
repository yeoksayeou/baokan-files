A Visit to the Former Japanese Germ Warfare Factory in the Pingfang Area
    Zhòng Lún, Guì Yuán

    Our reporters inspected the site near Pingfang Station of the large-scale germ manufacturing plant of Japanese war criminals, fully confirming the results of the trial by the Soviet Primorsky Military Tribunal from December 25th to 30th, 1949. In this trial, Japanese germ warfare criminals admitted that they had established a large-scale germ manufacturing plant at Pingfang Station.

    Pingfang Station is located about twenty kilometers south of Harbin. Looking west from the station, there is a cluster of damaged buildings. Countless red broken walls and chimneys stand starkly, with tall iron frames toppled on the ground. This is the factory where the heinous Japanese fascists manufactured deadly germs in the past.

    This germ factory was divided into North and South factories. The South Factory, only three *li* away from the station, was specifically for the landing, takeoff, and repair of airplanes. Inside the grounds were aircraft hangars and an airfield. The North Factory was about ten *li* from the station, surrounded by a five- or six-foot-high earthen wall, with a three- or four-foot-deep ditch dug outside the wall, forming a "small city" in the wilderness. The buildings inside the fortress have been thoroughly destroyed, and it is now difficult to discern their original appearance. From a distance, only four chimneys and several incomplete walls remain. This is the location of the germ manufacturing plant. Here are the remains of the destroyed power plant, railway branch lines, and roads, as well as identifiable laboratories. Next to the laboratories are piles of white and light brown fragments of broken porcelain bombs. In the eastern corner of this small city, there are four rows of houses, surrounded by a solid concrete wall about four hundred meters long, one-thirty meters wide, and one meter high. Around the wall, each entrance has a nearly one-meter-deep ditch. On the walls of each row of dozens of long houses, there are four equally spaced square holes. Under the accumulated snow around this area, wire rat cages were found. This was the place for raising rats to preserve bacteria. The entire factory area (including both North and South factories) covered a radius of forty-five kilometers. In the past, this restricted area was extremely tightly sealed off by the Japanese. According to nearby residents, entering the factory required passing through four checkpoints. If a stranger, whether intentionally or unintentionally, stepped into this area, their life would be immediately forfeited. Moreover, the Japanese fascists divided the surrounding villages and hamlets within dozens of *li* into restricted zones A and B. Anyone entering or leaving this restricted zone had to have special permits, otherwise, passage was prohibited. Whenever a train passed through this restricted area, the curtains had to be drawn down at the previous station. Each carriage was guarded by military police, and if a passenger so much as turned their head slightly, they risked being arrested on the spot. Those arrested would be interrogated at best, and lose their lives at worst. Therefore, local residents called it the "sixty-*li* border."

    Nearby residents also said that from the first day of constructing this factory, the Japanese fascists sent batches of "laborers" and entire train cars of donkeys, horses, camels, cattle, and sheep from afar to this place, but they were never seen being transported out or released. It was like a terrifying, massive monster, devouring countless lives day and night. To investigate some of the internal truths of this matter, our reporters traveled throughout the villages and hamlets surrounding this restricted area, hoping to find some eyewitnesses, but almost failed. Because there were very few people left here. But finally, we found three farmers living near Pingfang Station. One of them, named Li Rixiao, had worked for the Japanese outside the factory for many years. He told reporters that one autumn evening, a tiler named Chen You had escaped from the restricted area with extraordinary luck. This tiler told Li: "A year ago, more than three hundred of us were captured and brought here to build 'round buildings' (referring to the bacterial laboratories) for the Japanese. But every few days, ten or eight people would disappear. Now only about a hundred of us are left. If we keep working inside, we'll all lose our lives."

    Another farmer, named Fu Jingqi, also worked for the Japanese outside this slaughterhouse factory. He said that in the northeast corner of this factory, there was a small house with a tall chimney nearby, which often emitted yellow smoke. Whenever the wind blew, one could smell a nauseating stench. This small house has now been destroyed, and it is difficult to see what kind of monster it was. But its tall chimney still stands. Among the ruins, there are still remnants of a brick kiln about seven or eight feet long. Undoubtedly, the bodies of countless people killed by the Japanese were devoured by it.

    The crime of the Japanese manufacturing germs to kill livestock was evidenced in the testimony of farmer Chen Fangsheng. He told reporters that once, on a rainy day, the Japanese dragged four donkeys to the Chengzigou area. He personally saw that after the plane dropped yellow smoke explosives, three of the donkeys died immediately. The other one that did not die was examined in detail and then dragged back into that evil lair. Based on these facts, we can understand why people mysteriously disappeared as soon as they entered this forbidden city.

    The inhumane Japanese fascist bandits, when they were disastrously defeated, in order to eliminate traces of their crimes, blew up these buildings the day before they fled, encircled five or six hundred Chinese laborers in electric fences, and machine-gunned them all to death. These fascist bandits thought that in this way, they could escape the judgment of the people and shirk responsibility for their heinous crimes. But although these fascist bandits had ways to destroy these criminal buildings, they could not eliminate the evidence of their crimes.

    When the Japanese fled, they released a large number of rats infected with plague bacteria from this factory. These rats quickly spread to the nearby countryside. Immediately afterward, in the summer of the following year, 1946, a plague epidemic broke out in this area. From June to September, almost every day three or four people or five or six people died in the villages and hamlets of this area. Later, the epidemic spread wider and wider, and some families even died out completely, creating a very terrifying scene. According to statistics from Laowutun, Yifayuan, and Dashujingzi alone, one hundred and three people died in this epidemic. This blood debt, as well as countless other blood debts in various places, must be repaid by the Japanese fascist ringleader Hirohito. (Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, 11th)

　　前日寇细菌工厂平房地区视察记
    重仑　桂圆
    记者视察了平房车站附近日本战犯的大规模细菌制造厂的旧地，完全证实了一九四九年十二月二十五日至三十日苏联滨海军事法庭审讯的结果，在这个审讯中，日本细菌战犯承认他们曾在平房车站设立大规模的细菌制造厂。
    从哈尔滨向南行约二十公里即可到达平房车站。从车站向西望去，有一片被破坏了的建筑物。无数红色的断壁和烟突，峭然屹立着，高大的铁架子翻倒在地上。这就是罪恶滔天的日本法西斯昔日制造杀人细菌的工厂了。
    这个细菌工厂，共分南北二厂。南厂距离车站只有三华里，是专门为了升降与修理飞机用的。场内建筑有飞机库和飞机场。北厂距离车站约十华里，周围筑有五、六尺高的土墙，墙外掘着三、四尺深的沟，形成一座荒野中的“小城”。城堡中的建筑因为遭受彻底破坏，现在已很难看出其原来的面貌。远远望去，仅有四个烟突和几处不很高的残缺墙壁。这就是细菌制造厂所在地。这里有已被炸毁了的发电厂，有铁路支线，有汽车路，有被炸毁了但仍可辨认出来的化验室。化验室旁边堆有白色、淡褐色残缺不全的破瓷器炸弹片。在这座小城的东角上，有四行房子，四周筑有长约四百米，宽一三十米，高一米的坚固洋灰围墙。围墙四周，每个门入口处都筑有将近一米深的沟。在每行数十间的长房子墙上，建筑有距离相等的四个方洞。在这周围的积雪底下，发现了铁丝鼠笼。这就是育鼠保菌的场所。整个工厂地区（南北两厂包括在内），方圆共四十五公里。在这块禁地范围内，过去是被日寇极端严密地封锁着的。据附近居民说：进入厂内，必须经过四道卡子。如果是一个生人，不论他是有意无意，只要踏进这个地区范围，那末他的生命就会立即断送掉。不仅如此，日本法西斯把这里周围几十里的村屯划分为甲乙禁区，凡在这块禁区内出入的人，都要有特别证明，否则一概禁止通行。每当火车通过这块禁区时，在前一站就要放下窗帘。每个车厢都有宪兵看守，如有旅客稍微转转脑袋，就有当场被捕的危险，被捕者轻则受审，重则生命不保。因此当地居民称之为“六十里地国境”。
    附近居民并说：从修建这个厂子的第一天起，日本法西斯就从远处把整批的“劳工”和整车厢的驴马、骆驼以及牛羊送到这里面，却从来没有看见再被运出或被放出去的。它好似一个可怕的庞大怪物，日日夜夜吞食着无数生命。为了探知这件事情的一些内部真情，记者曾走遍这片禁地周围的村屯，想找到一些曾亲眼目睹的人，几乎是失败了。因为这里的人已经很少。但最后终于找到了三个住在平房车站的农民。其中一个叫李日校，他曾在这个厂子外围给日寇做了多年工。他告诉记者说，在一个秋天的晚上，有个名叫陈有的瓦匠，异常幸运地从禁地里偷逃了出来。这瓦匠告诉李说：“一年以前我们一共有三百多人被抓到这里来给日本人修筑“转圈楼”（指细菌化验室）。可是每过些日子，就要丢失十个、八个人。到现在我们只剩下百十来人了。再在里边做下去，都得送命。”
    另外还有一个农民叫傅景奇，也是在这杀人工厂的外围给日寇做过工的。他说：在这个厂子的东北角，有一所不大的房子，旁边有一个高烟突，烟筒时常冒着黄色的烟。每遇到刮风天，顶着风就可闻到一种使人发呕的恶臭气味。这所小房子现在已毁坏了，很难看出究竟是怎样的怪物。但它的高烟的还依然矗立着。这堆废墟筒中间，还有约七八尺长的砖窑的残部。无疑的，那无数被日寇杀死的人的尸体就是被它吞食了的。
    日寇制造杀害牲畜的细菌的罪行，在农民陈芳盛的谈话中，得到了证据。他告诉记者说：有一次，在雨后的一天，日寇拉着四头驴到城子沟地区。他亲眼看到当飞机投下了冒黄烟的爆炸物后，其中三头驴立即死掉。另外未死的一头，被详细检查以后又拉回那罪恶的重围了。根据这些事实，我们就可以明白为什么人们一进入这个禁城，就无影无踪的神秘了。
    毫无人性的日本法西斯匪徒，在其遭到惨败的时候，为了消灭他们的罪恶踪迹，在逃走的前一天，将这些建筑尽行炸毁，把五六百个中国劳工圈在电网内，用机枪全部扫死。这些法西斯匪徒们以为这样就可逃脱人民的审判，卸却滔天罪恶的责任。但这些法西斯匪徒们，虽有办法毁坏这些罪恶的建筑物，他们却无法消灭掉罪恶证据。
    日寇在逃跑时，曾把这个厂子里染有鼠疫细菌的大批老鼠放出来。这些老鼠很快就散布到附近的乡间。紧接着，第二年即一九四六年的夏天，这一带就流行着鼠疫传染病。从六月到九月间，这一带屯子几乎每天都死掉三、四个人或五、六个人，后来传染病愈来愈扩大，有的甚至全家死绝，造成一种非常恐怖的惨景。仅根据老五屯、义发源、大束井子三个屯的统计，就有一百零三人死于这次疫灾中。这笔血债以及其他各地的无数血债一定要日本法西斯魁首裕仁偿还。（新华社哈尔滨十一日电）
