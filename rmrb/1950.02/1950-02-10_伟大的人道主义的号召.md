　　The Soviet government's note to our country, as well as to the British and American governments, proposing the establishment of a special international military tribunal to try Japanese bacterial warfare criminals such as Hirohito, is a call for great humanitarianism from a socialist country of the working people. Our Central People's Government's Ministry of Foreign Affairs has already replied by telegram expressing its agreement. We are willing to support this selfless call together with our Central People's Government, all the Chinese people, and the people of the world.

　　During the War of Resistance Against Japan, we heard that the Japanese invaders had conducted bacterial warfare, but the traitorous and harmful Chiang Kai-shek's Kuomintang government never announced this criminal act committed by the Japanese invaders in the Kuomintang defense areas; only progressive patriotic journalists published reports exposing this crime in the CCP's newspapers or in general progressive newspapers.

　　If the Soviet army had not swiftly dispatched troops to completely annihilate the Kwantung Army, this case of inhumane and heinous crime would probably have been concealed without a trace. The Chinese people once dreamed of the impartial Bao Zheng; now, the oppressed people of the world have the just judicial organs of the socialist Soviet Union, which is a truly impartial Bao Zheng to the enemies of mankind.

　　The Soviet Union's proposal to have bacterial warfare criminal Emperor Hirohito and others tried by a special international military tribunal is not only a consolation to the dead, but also a powerful protection for the living, for all mankind, and for their future generations. It is a just act that provides security not only for the Soviet people, but also for the Chinese people, as well as for the British and American people, and for the people of all countries in the world.

　　We express our grief and indignation in remembrance of the Chinese, Soviet, and Mongolian people who suffered and sacrificed themselves in the research and implementation of Japanese bacterial warfare, and we express our sincere gratitude to the just trial of the Soviet judicial organs.

　　The Chinese people suffered the most from the research and implementation of Japanese bacterial warfare. Recently, there have been gradual exposures in the People's Daily. Changde in Hunan, Ningbo and Wenzhou in Zhejiang, and other places have all been harmed by the Japanese invaders' bacterial warfare. The area near Jujiayao in Anda County, Heilongjiang in Northeast China was the location where the Japanese invaders used thousands of Chinese and Soviet living people to experiment with bacterial warfare, and the local residents suffered greatly.

　　The Chinese people have personally experienced the scourge of bacterial warfare, and the Chinese people have sacrificed thousands of lives. Therefore, the Chinese people have a special obligation and right to accuse the Japanese invaders of this crime to the people of the world.

　　All kind people in the world, regardless of race, belief, or wealth, please look at the scourge of bacterial warfare suffered by the Chinese people, look at the Japanese invaders' horrifying crime against humanity, and you will certainly not want yourselves and your descendants to suffer this scourge again.

　　The Soviet government's proposal for a special international military tribunal to try Japanese bacterial warfare criminals headed by Hirohito is not only to spare the Soviet and Chinese people from this disaster, but also to spare the British and American people, and the people of the world, from this disaster. Can all conscientious men and women not support this selfless proposal of the Soviet Union?

　　The trial of bacterial warfare criminals, like the trial of all other war criminals, has the fundamental purpose of saving today's mankind and their descendants from all inhumane imperialist wars. Because imperialist war is the trump card used by a few multi-millionaires in their wild attempt to enslave all mankind. If mankind wants to liberate itself from all systems of slavery to this day, it must first liberate itself from the war policies of a few wealthy people, especially the American imperialists, who attempt to put mankind to death.

　　The Soviet government's call for an international trial of bacterial warfare criminals is also to save human civilization and science.

　　To what extent the so-called "Western civilization" of a few multi-millionaire capitalists has become corrupted and degenerate can be judged from the attitude towards Japanese bacterial warfare criminals. The purchasing policy of multi-millionaires has turned many people and a few scientists into moral idiots. The slogan "science for science's sake" is making a few moral idiots unable to distinguish right from wrong. Under the slogan of "science for science's sake," some morally idiotic scientists help a few multi-millionaires use science to commit crimes.

　　Using science to commit crimes is the most malicious intellectual crime. But bourgeois jurisprudence is silent about this. This cannot but make people feel the righteousness of Soviet socialist justice. When a few capitalist power holders force science and scientists to commit crimes that endanger mankind, mankind, in order to defend itself and scientific civilization, must unite to respond to and support the great call of the Soviet government to save mankind, clarify morality, and save civilization.

### 伟大的人道主义的号召

　　伟大的人道主义的号召
    何思敬
    苏联政府向我国以及向英美政府提议设立特别国际军事法庭审判裕仁等日本细菌战犯的照会，是劳动人民社会主义国家的伟大的人道主义的号召。我中央人民政府外交部已复电表示同意。我们愿和我中央人民政府、全体中国人民及全世界人民一起拥护这一大公无私的号召。
    在抗日战争中我们曾听见过日寇进行过细菌战，但卖国殃民的蒋匪国民党政府就从来没有宣告日寇在国民党防区中进行的这一犯罪行为；只有进步的爱国记者曾在中共的报纸上或在一般进步的报纸上发表过揭露这种罪行的通讯。
    如果没有苏军神速出兵全部歼灭了关东军，恐怕这一灭绝人性的大犯罪的案情早已被隐蔽得无影无踪了。中国人民曾梦想过铁面无私的包文正，现在，全世界被压迫人民有了社会主义苏联的正义司法机关，也就有了一个对人类敌人真正铁面无私的包文正了。
    苏联对细菌战犯裕仁天皇等交特别国际军事法庭审判的提议，当然不仅是对死者的安慰，而且是对生者、对全人类及其后代子孙的一个强有力的保护。它不仅是对苏联人民，而且是对中国人民，还对英美人民，对全世界各国人民的安全保障的一个正义的行为。
    我们对在日寇细菌战的研究与实施中受难牺牲的中苏及蒙古人民致悲愤的追悼，更对苏联司法机关的正义的审判致恳切的谢意。
    在日寇细菌战的研究与实施中受害最大的是中国人民。最近在人民日报上已经逐渐有些揭发。湖南常德、浙江宁波、温州等地都受到了日寇细菌战的祸害。东北黑龙江安达县鞠家窑附近是日寇用数千中苏活人来实验细菌战的地点，当地居民受害亦属匪浅。
    中国人民身历其境地遭到了细菌战的祸害、中国人民牺牲了千百条生命。因此中国人民特别有义务和权利向全世界人民控诉日寇的这一罪行。
    全世界一切善良的人们，不分种族、信仰与贫富，你们请看中国人民所受的细菌战争的祸害吧，你们看看日寇与人类为敌的令人战栗的犯罪吧，你们总不会愿意使你们自己和你们的子孙重遭这种祸害吧。
    苏联政府提议由特别国际军事法庭来审判以裕仁为首的日本细菌战犯，不仅要想使苏联人民和中国人民免于这种灾祸，而且还要想使英美人民，使全世界人民免于这种灾祸。难道一切有良心的男女能够不拥护苏联的这一大公无私的提议吗？
    审判细菌战犯和审判其他一切战犯一样，它的根本目的就是要使今日的人类及其子孙免于一切惨无人道的帝国主义战争。因为帝国主义战争是少数亿万富豪妄想用以奴役全人类的王牌。人类若欲从至今一切奴隶制度下解放自己，必须首先从少数富豪尤其美帝国主义者企图置人类于死地的战争政策下解放出来。
    苏联政府的这一国际审判细菌战犯的号召，同时也是要拯救人类的文明和科学。
    少数亿万资本富豪的所谓“西方文明”已经腐化堕落到什么程度，可以用对日寇细菌战犯的态度来作一方面的判断。亿万富豪们的收买政策已使许多人和少数科学家变成道德的白痴。“为科学而科学”的口号正使少数道德的白痴不辨是非善恶。在“为科学而科学”的口号下使一些道德白痴的科学家帮助少数亿万富豪们使用科学来犯罪。
    用科学来犯罪，这是最恶性的智能犯罪。但是资产阶级的法学对此是默然无声的。这又不能不令人感到苏联社会主义的司法的正气。当少数资本权力者强迫科学与科学家进行危害人类的犯罪时，人类为了保卫自己和科学文明起见，必须团结起来响应与拥护苏联政府的拯救人类、澄清道德、拯救文明的伟大号召。
