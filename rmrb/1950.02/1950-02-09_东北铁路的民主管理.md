Democratic Management of Northeast Railways
Northeast Railway Federation of Trade Unions Chairman Li Mingzhe

Northeast Railways has 807 stations of the third class or above, 197 management sections including locomotive, engineering, electrical, rolling stock, and transportation, and 7 factories with 700 to 5,000 or more employees. Among them, 464 units have established democratic management systems – management committees and employee representative conferences, accounting for 45.9% of the total number of stations, sections, and factories. The current status of democratic management is that some are able to regularly convene representative conferences, where the masses can promptly raise problems existing in the production process, and management personnel and trade unions can earnestly solve these problems. The administration, the Party, and the trade union can closely cooperate, and work is uniformly arranged around production tasks. Except for urgent work orders such as train operation, general matters can be negotiated, especially personnel rewards and punishments, which are decided after discussion by the management committee. Workers and staff participate in the management committee, have democratic rights, and work very actively, so the decisions of the administration and the management committee can be smoothly implemented. This situation applies only to some excellent stations, sections, and factories. In most units, the administration assigns production tasks, and after discussion by the management committee, the Party and the trade union are responsible for supervising separately. The management committee meets regularly, but more things are passed than discussed. The employees participating in the management committee only attend as a formality or routinely transmit information downwards. The representative conference is also held frequently, and most of the things arranged are from top to bottom. The administration often delays addressing problems and suggestions reflected and raised by the representatives, citing difficulties. Criticism and self-criticism are also carried out intermittently, but the effect is not significant. The management committee and the representative conference do not have high prestige among the masses. An even worse situation is that the management committee and the representative conference in some stations and sections are merely formalities. After the election of the management committee or employee representative conference, there is no actual democratic management activity. Most of the members of the management committee are administrative cadres, and the content of the meetings is not or rarely discusses production work, but only inquires about and explains some purely technical issues. The representative conference cannot be convened on time, and even when convened, it is mostly speeches by administrative leaders and conveying tasks. Employees do not understand the tasks and interrelationships of the management committee and the representative conference. However, such stations and sections are only a small number.

How to implement democratic management? First of all, it is necessary to mobilize the broad masses of workers. Whether in new or old areas, it is necessary to enlighten the class consciousness of the broad masses of workers, so that they understand that the working class occupies the leading position as masters in the new democratic society. In railway units in the new areas, it is necessary to strengthen investigation and research work, listen to the opinions of the masses of workers, understand the personnel situation in the enterprise, and conduct appropriate personnel adjustments according to the needs of production and the enterprise. It is also possible to carry out democratic appraisal of bad work styles and shortcomings in the work. Through these steps, active elements among the employees are discovered, and after mass elections, they are absorbed into the representative conference to become the backbone of democratic management. In railway units in the old areas, after the employees have political consciousness and the personnel organization of the enterprise has been reorganized, to achieve democratic management and inspire employees to actively care about the railway, it is necessary to carry out an in-depth mass democratic movement, conduct mass criticism and inspection targeting the main shortcomings of each department, and establish an employee representative conference and management committee after solving some problems that urgently need to be solved. Only in this way will they be powerful and energetic.

Secondly, it is necessary to educate cadres, especially administrative cadres, so that they thoroughly understand the important significance of democratic management work and recognize that relying on the working class is the main key to running the people's railway well. As long as the administrative cadres do a good job in the management committee, they can take the initiative to unite the forces in the entire enterprise, eliminate the uncoordinated and abnormal phenomena that are prone to occur in the relationship between the administration, the Party, and the trade union, and work together to complete the production tasks.

In addition, according to the situation of various units of Northeast Railways, many of our cadres are not good at using the weapon of democratic management and do not understand how to carry out this work. Therefore, the Party, the trade union, and the administrative leadership should learn and summarize more experience in this area, and help and guide the general cadres, so that they can learn to use this weapon. What should the management committee do on a daily basis? For example, when the administration receives a task from the higher levels, the management committee should study the key to completing this task, grasp the key to promote the work, and then organize the masses to complete the task. The administration should circulate the business orders and instructions from the higher levels to all members of the management committee as much as possible. Personnel transfers, promotions and demotions, rewards and punishments, daily key tasks, and all work plans should be studied in the management committee and become the common work and plan of the management committee. The management committee should become an organic organization for the administration to promote and check work. For example, if a locomotive section wants to maintain good locomotive quality, it is necessary to systematically inspect all locomotives and precisely check the qualified status of repaired products. This requires organizing the backbone forces and mass organizations in all aspects to do this work, and the management committee is the most suitable organization for this kind of work.

Thirdly, there is the issue of how the management committee and the representative conference are generated and convened. It is not good to suddenly convene a general meeting of all employees to elect a management committee without in-depth deliberation and education among the masses. It is necessary to publicize and deliberate for a period of time, so that the masses understand why the management committee should be established and what are the benefits of democratic management. Then, democratically elect employee representatives from various departments, and organize these representatives to go deep into the masses to enlighten the masses to raise problems existing in the work and their opinions on the work. The representative conference should seriously study these problems and opinions. Problems and requests related to work should be effectively resolved, and opinions related to the life of employees that can be resolved or urgently need to be resolved should be resolved immediately. In this way, the representative conference can be held well, and the representatives can also establish faith among the masses. The management committee generated on this basis will have a high degree of prestige, and the masses' impression of the management committee will be profound. According to our experience, the leadership's use of the representative conference to promote and check work will achieve great results.

Because railway transportation work is highly unified, centralized, and planned, many people doubt whether a democratic management system can be established in the railway transportation department, fearing that it will disrupt the one-leader system and the command system in transportation. Based on our experience in implementing democratic management in the railway transportation department, the management committee and the employee representative conference will not interfere with the transportation department's planned train operation and the emergency measures of the transportation leader's command. The task of the management committee and the representative conference is to mobilize and organize the masses to complete the transportation plan and execute orders. For example, if Northeast Railways wants to realize the huge winter transportation plan, the first problem it encounters is that all transportation departments and departments closely related to transportation must do a good job in cold protection to overcome the damage and obstruction of the severe cold to transportation. Therefore, the higher authorities issued instructions and plans for cold protection, and all stations, water supply stations, locomotive depots, locomotives, telecommunications, and lines must fully implement the cold protection plan and instructions. And this plan must be achieved before the arrival of winter. Northeast Railways is so long, intricate, and has so many complex departments that it is difficult for the administrative departments to complete the plan on schedule by relying solely on top-down inspections. Therefore, the administrative departments must launch a democratic inspection of cold protection work, raise the problems existing in the cold protection work, and launch criticism of personnel who are not performing well in cold protection work, in order to thoroughly and completely implement the realization of the cold protection plan. As for improving transportation efficiency, reducing costs, and shortening turnover rate, it is impossible to complete the task without relying on democratic management and the active and hard work of employees.

At present, there are 126 "Iron Ox" locomotives in the Northeast Railway system. Some have increased their traction rate to 2,000 tons, some have saved more than 75 tons of coal per month, and some have exceeded 180,000 kilometers of first-class inspection period. There are more than 40 excellent stations that have not had any accidents for more than 100 days. Among them, the Nanyi Station, the transportation center for timber and coal in northern Manchuria, has completely achieved zero accidents for 300 days. These excellent units have achieved such brilliant results because they have implemented democratic management.

　　东北铁路的民主管理
    东北铁路总工会主席  李明哲
    东北铁路有八百零七个三等以上的车站，有机务、工务、电务、检车、车务等一百九十七个管理段，有员工七百至五千人以上的工厂七个。其中建立了民主管理制度——管理委员会和职工代表会议的有四百六十四个单位，占站、段、工厂总数的百分之四十五点九。民主管理的现状，一种是能够经常召开代表会议，群众能及时的提出生产过程中所存在的问题，管理人员和工会对这些问题能认真的加以解决。行政、党、工会能够密切配合，围绕生产任务统一布置工作。除了紧急的行车等工作命令外，一般的事情均能协商，尤其是人事奖惩等，均经过管委会研究决定。工人、职员参加了管委会，有了民主权利，工作很积极，所以行政与管委会的决定，均能顺利实现。属于这一类情形的，只是一些优秀的站段和工厂。多数单位的情形是：行政上布置的生产任务，经过管委会讨论后，党和工会能够分头负责督促。管委会定期开会，但通过的事情多，讨论的事情则不多。参加管委会的员工只是例行出席，或是例行的向下传达。代表会也经常开，也是自上而下布置的事情多。行政上对代表所反映和提出的问题，多借口有困难予以拖延。批评与自我批评也断续的进行，但效果不大。管委会和代表会在群众中的威信都不高。更不好的一种情况是，有些站段的管委会和代表会仅具形式，选举成立了管委会或职工代表会后，即无民主管理的实际活动。管理委员会委员大多数是行政干部，会议内容不是讨论或很少讨论生产工作，只是询问和说明一些单纯的技术性问题。代表会不能按时召开，即使召开，大都是行政首长训话和传达任务。员工不了解管委会和代表会的任务与相互间的关系。但这类站段只是很少数。
    如何施行民主管理？首先应该发动广大工人群众。无论在新老地区，必须要启发广大工人群众的阶级觉悟，使他们了解工人阶级在新民主主义社会里居于主人翁的领导地位。在新区铁路单位中，必须加强调查研究工作，听取工人群众的意见，了解企业中的人事情况，依照生产和企业的需要，适当的进行人事调整。并可开展对坏作风和工作中存在的弊端的民主评议，经过这些步骤，发现职工中的积极分子，经过群众选举吸收到代表会来，使其成为民主管理的基干。在老区铁路单位中，职工有了政治觉悟，企业的人事组织经过了整理，要达到民主管理，启发员工积极的关心铁路，则需要进行一个深入的群众民主运动，针对着各该部门的主要的弊病进行群众性的批评检查，解决一些必需急于解决的问题以后成立起职工代表会和管委会，才会是有力量和有生气的。
    其次，要教育干部尤其是行政干部使他们透彻了解民主管理工作的重要意义，认识依靠工人阶级是办好人民铁路的主要关键。只要行政干部把管委会工作做好了，就能主动的把整个企业中的力量团结起来，消弭行政、党、工会关系中容易发生的不协调和不正常的现象，统一步调为完成生产任务而努力。
    另外，根据东北铁路各单位的情况，我们许多的干部还不善于运用民主管理这个武器，不大懂得如何进行这个工作，因之党和工会以及行政领导方面，要多多吸取总结这方面的经验，帮助和指导一般的干部，使之学会运用这一武器。管理委员会日常应该做些什么事情？如行政上接到了上级的任务，管理委员会就应研究出完成这个任务的关键所在，抓住关键去推进工作，才能组织群众完成任务。行政上要将上级来的业务命令指示要尽量给各个管理委员传阅，人事调动升降，奖励和惩罚，每日的主要工作，和一切工作计划都要在管委会上研究，成为管委会共同的工作和计划。要使管委会成为行政上推进及检查工作的一个有机的组织。例如一个机务段要达到机车质量保持良好，就要系统的检查所有的机车，要精密的检查修车成品的合格状况，这就要把各方面的基干力量以及群众组织起来做这个工作，这种组织工作只有以管委会来做最为适合。
    再次，是管委会和代表会怎样产生和召集会议的问题。没有深入的在群众中进行酝酿和教育，突然召开全体职工大会选举管理委员会，这是搞不好的。必须宣传酝酿一个时期，让群众都明白为什么要成立管委会，民主管理有什么好处，然后民主的选出包括各部门的职工代表，并组织这些代表深入群众启发群众提出工作中所存在的问题，和他们对于工作的意见。代表会议对于这些问题和意见，应该认真加以研究，其中属于工作上的困难和要求，应该切实的予以解决，而属于职工生活方面的意见，凡可能解决或急于解决者，则应立即为之解决。这样，代表会才能开好，代表在群众中也建立了信仰，在这个基础上产生的管理委员会，也才会有高度的威信，群众对管委会的印象也才会深刻。以后领导上运用代表会推进与检查工作，根据我们的经验，成绩是会很大的。
    由于铁路运输工作是高度的统一集中和计划性的工作，因之许多人就怀疑在铁路运输部门是不是能建立民主管理制度，害怕因此紊乱了运输上的一长制和司令制度。依据我们在铁路运输部门实行民主管理的经验，管委会和职工代表会是不会去干涉运输部门计划行车和运输首长司令的紧急措施的。而管委会和代表会的任务，恰是要动员与组织群众完成运输计划和执行命令。譬如东北铁路要实现巨大的冬季运输计划，第一个碰到的问题，是要各个运输及和运输密切有关的部门做好防寒工作，以克服严寒对运输的破坏阻碍。因之上级颁发了防寒的训令和计划，所有的车站、给水所、机关车库、机关车、电讯及线路等，必须完满的执行防寒计划和训令。而且这个计划必须在冬季到来以前达成。东北铁路如此漫长、错综，如此众多而复杂的部门，单靠行政方面自上而下的检查，那是很困难如期完成计划的，因之行政方面必须发动对防寒工作的民主检查，提出防寒工作中所存在的问题，展开对防寒工作执行得不好的人员的批评，才能深入而完满的贯彻防寒计划的实现。至于要做到提高运输效率，减低成本，缩短周转率，不依靠民主管理，不依靠员工的积极努力工作，那更是不可能完成任务的。
    目前东北铁路系统有一二六台“铁牛”机车，有的牵引率提高至二千吨，有的省煤率月逾七十五吨，有的甲检期超越十八万公里；一百天以上毫未发生事故的优秀车站，共有四十多个，其中北满木材及煤的运输中心南义车站，三百天完全做到了无事故。这些优秀的单位，都是实行了民主管理才能获得这样光辉的成绩的。
