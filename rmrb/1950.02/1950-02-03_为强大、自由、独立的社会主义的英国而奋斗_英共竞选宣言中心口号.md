　　Xinhua News Agency, Prague, February 2nd: London dispatch: The Communist Party of Great Britain (CPGB) published its election manifesto on January 21st, putting forward the central slogan of the CPGB's current struggle: to fight to stop the economic crisis, to stop the war movement, and to stop the United States' control over Britain. The only way out for Britain is to realize true socialism.

　　The manifesto points out that the common path that the Conservative Party and the Labour Party, which actually implements the Conservative Party's policies, have planned for the British people is poverty, unemployment, war, and being a vassal of American imperialism. However, the Conservative Party and the Labour Party use flowery words to make people forget this fact, which history has already proven. The manifesto emphasizes that only the Communist Party's policies can save the British working people from the disasters of the growing economic crisis and bring them and their families peace, prosperity, and happiness.

　　End US Imperialist Control Over Britain, Withdraw from Various Aggressive Covenants, Join the Peaceful and Democratic Camp

　　The manifesto reiterates the policies put forward in the election program adopted by the 21st Congress of the CPGB held last November and announces that it will participate in the election with 100 candidates, "to fight for constructive social policies at home and lasting peace abroad."

　　The manifesto calls for a complete change in foreign policy, demanding to stand with the peaceful camp headed by the Soviet Union, to end the United States' control over British policy, to withdraw from various military blocs and covenants that plot war, to withdraw colonial troops, to give colonial people autonomy, and to transfer the huge manpower and financial resources consumed by the military to activities that benefit the people's welfare. The manifesto also calls for the implementation of genuine nationalization at home, with reliable representatives elected by the working class in control, and the nationalization of all basic industries and land; instead of lowering wages and canceling food subsidies, lowering prices and profits, increasing wages, and thus increasing the purchasing power and living standards of the people; instead of increasing welfare expenses, greatly increasing taxes on huge profits; instead of cutting social undertakings, increasing housing, schools, sanatoriums, hospitals, free medical care, and free meals and transportation for children in school, improving the opportunities for young workers and students to enjoy technical and general education, and increasing subsidies for the unemployed and veterans, alimony for women, and pensions; instead of extending working hours, guaranteeing a 40-hour work week; instead of extending military service, shortening it.

　　Nationalize Basic Industries and Land, Increase Social Welfare, Lower Prices and Profits

　　Establish and Develop Friendship and Trade with the Soviet Union, China, and People's Democratic Countries

　　The manifesto emphasizes the importance of friendship and the development of large-scale and comprehensive trade with the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and other people's democratic countries for Britain. The manifesto points out: "The Soviet Union, the people's democratic countries, and the People's Republic of China give us friendship and trade. If we accept this, we will get jobs, food, and raw materials and strengthen peace."

　　The manifesto confidently points out that as long as the working people unite to strike, they will surely be able to defeat the reactionary Conservative Party in the general election; however, the manifesto also calls on workers to support the Communist Party's candidates in all constituencies where there are Communist Party candidates to show that they also oppose the pro-Conservative policies of the Labour government. The Communist Party's parliamentary group, as Gallagher and Piratin have already brilliantly demonstrated, will "carry out a real battle inside and outside Parliament to defend and improve the working conditions and living conditions of the working people and help remove the danger of war," "because the Communists only have one object of allegiance—the working class, and we serve the workers with all our strength and energy."

　　Only Socialism Can Meet the Needs of the People

　　The manifesto finally emphasizes that only the establishment of a "government based on a fighting, united workers' movement with Communist Party representatives participating" can lead Britain on the road to socialism; and that "only socialism can guarantee that every mine and factory, every acre of land is organized to meet the needs of the people, not to seek the interests of a few. Only socialism can fully organize the country's resources, enrich the arts and sciences, and develop cultural requirements and national aspirations."

　　"Strive for a strong, free, and independent socialist Britain" is the slogan at the end of the CPGB manifesto.

　　为强大、自由、独立的社会主义的英国而奋斗
    英共竞选宣言中心口号
    【新华社布拉格二日电】伦敦消息：英国共产党于一月二十一日发表竞选宣言，提出英共目前斗争的中心口号是：为制止经济危机、制止战争运动以及停止美国对英国的控制而斗争，英国唯一的出路是实现真正的社会主义。
    宣言指出：保守党以及实际上执行保守党政策的工党，为英国人民规划的共同道路，就是贫困、失业、战争和充当美帝国主义的附庸。但是，保守党和工党却以华丽的词藻来使人忘记历史已经证实了的这个事实。宣言强调说：只有共产党的政策，才能使英国劳动人民免于日益增长的经济危机的灾害，并给他们和他们的家庭带来和平、繁荣与幸福。
    结束美帝对英控制退出各种侵略公约参加和平民主阵营
    宣言重申去年十一月举行的英共二十一届代表大会通过的竞选纲领中所提出的各项政策，并宣布以一百名候选人参加竞选，“为国内建设性的社会政策和对外的持久和平而奋斗”。
    宣言要求彻底改变外交政策，要求和以苏联为首的和平阵营站在一起，结束美国对英国政策的控制，退出策划战争的各种军事集团和公约，撤回殖民军队，给殖民地人民以自治，并把消耗于军事的庞大人力与财力，转用于有益于人民福利的活动。宣言同时要求在国内实行真正的有工人阶级选出的可靠代表掌握的国有化，把一切基本工业及土地收归国有；不是压低工资和取消食物津贴，而是压低物价和利润，增加工资因而提高人民的购买力及生活水平；不是增收福利事业费用，而是大大增加对巨大利润的课税；不是削减社会事业，而是增加房屋、学校、疗养所、医院、免费医疗及就学儿童的免费膳食和交通，改进青年工人及学生享受技术教育和一般教育的机会，增加失业和退伍军人的补助费、妇女赡养费及养老金；不是延长工作时间，而是保证四十小时工作周；不是延长军役，而是将它缩短。
    将基本工业及土地收归国有增加社会福利压低物价利润
    与苏联、中国、人民民主国家建立与发展友好和贸易
    宣言强调与苏联、中华人民共和国及其他人民民主国家友好和发展大规模全面贸易对英国的重要性。宣言指出：“苏联、各人民民主国家与中华人民共和国给我们友谊和贸易。我们接受这个，就会得到工作、食物和原料并加强和平。”
    宣言有信心地指出：只要在劳动人民的联合打击之下，必定能够在大选中击败反动的保守党；但是，宣言同时号召工人应在一切有共产党候选人的选区，支持共产党的候选人，以表示他们也反对工党政府的亲保守党的政策。共产党的议员集团，将如加拉赫及皮拉丁所已经光辉地表现的一样，“在议会内外进行真正的战斗，以保卫和改进劳动人民的工作条件和生活条件，并有助于去除战争的危险”，“因为，共产党人只有一个效忠的对象——工人阶级，我们用我们全部的力量和精力为工人服务。”
    只有实行社会主义才能满足人民的需要
    宣言最后强调称：只有建立一个“以战斗的、统一的工人运动为基础，并有共产党代表参加的政府”，才能使英国走向社会主义的道路；而“只有社会主义，才能保证每一个矿坑和工厂，每一亩土地都组织起来，以满足人民的需要，而不是谋少数人的利益。只有社会主义，才能充分地组织国家的富源，丰富艺术和科学，发展文化的要求和民族的意愿”。
    “为强大、自由、独立的社会主义的英国而奋斗”，这是英共宣言结尾的口号。
