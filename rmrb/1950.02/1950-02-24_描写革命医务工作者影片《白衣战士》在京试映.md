Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, February 21st: The new film "White-Clad Warriors," produced by the Northeast Film Studio of the Film Bureau of the Central People's Government's Ministry of Culture, has been completed and will soon be shown in cities such as Beijing and Tianjin. This film depicts the high degree of self-sacrifice displayed by Chinese revolutionary medical workers in rescuing the wounded and sick during the War of Liberation, and can be regarded as a model for medical workers in New China. In order to solicit the opinions of medical workers as a reference for improvement, the Film Bureau of the Ministry of Culture and the Health Department of the People's Revolutionary Military Commission held an advance screening at the National Cinema on the 12th, inviting medical personnel from the Ministry of Health of the Central People's Government, the Health Department of the People's Revolutionary Military Commission, the Health Department of the North China Military Region, and the Air Force Health Department to attend. He Cheng, Minister of the Health Department of the People's Revolutionary Military Commission, attended and delivered a speech. Minister He Cheng first stated that "White-Clad Warriors" is a very educational film. It demonstrates the spirit of medical workers serving wounded soldiers wholeheartedly, not fearing hardship or sacrifice, persisting in their work, putting the revolutionary cause first and personal interests second, and putting the lives of wounded soldiers first and their own lives second. In the more than 20 years of the People's Liberation War, many such figures have emerged who can serve as good examples for our medical workers. Minister He Cheng then encouraged medical workers to recognize their responsibilities, stand firmly at their posts, not aim too high or be fickle, work hard, and strive to build the health work of New China. To express their gratitude for the film's production, The Ministry of Health of the Central People's Government and the Health Department of the People's Revolutionary Military Commission presented two banners to the Film Bureau of the Ministry of Culture and the Northeast Film Studio.

　　描写革命医务工作者影片《白衣战士》在京试映
    【新华社北京二十一日电】中央人民政府文化部电影局东北电影制片厂摄制的新片《白衣战士》已经完成，即将在北京、天津等城市放映。这部影片是描写中国革命医务工作者在解放战争中所表现的救护伤病员的高度自我牺牲精神，堪称新中国医务工作者的典范。文化部电影局和人民革命军事委员会卫生部为征求医务工作者的意见，作为改进的参考，曾于十二日在国民电影院先行试映，招待中央人民政府卫生部、人民革命军事委员会卫生部、华北军区卫生部和空军卫生部等医务工作人员参观。人民革命军事委员会卫生部部长贺诚并出席讲话。贺诚部长首先说明“白衣战士”是一部很有教育意义的影片，在这部影片里表现了医务工作者全心全意为受伤的战士们服务的精神，不怕吃苦，不怕牺牲，坚持工作，把革命事业放在第一位，把个人的利益放在第二位；把受伤战士的生命放在第一位，把自己的生命放在第二位。在人民解放战争二十多年的历史中出现了许多这样的人物，可以作为我们医务工作人员的好榜样。贺诚部长继勉励医务工作人员要认清自己的责任，坚定地站在自己的工作岗位，不要好高骛远，见异思迁，努力工作，为建设新中国的卫生工作而奋斗。中央人民政府卫生部和人民革命军事委员会卫生部为表示对该片摄制的谢意，特赠文化部电影局和东北电影制片厂锦旗两面。
