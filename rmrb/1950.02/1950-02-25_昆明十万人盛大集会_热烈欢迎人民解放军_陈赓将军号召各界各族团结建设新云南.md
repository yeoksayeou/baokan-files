　　Xinhua News Agency, Kunming, 24th. Kunming held a grand rally of over 100,000 people from all walks of life on the 22nd to welcome the People's Liberation Army. The entire city was immersed in unprecedented jubilation throughout the day. Many workers, farmers, and people of minority ethnicities traveled from as far as seventy or eighty miles away, bringing banners and gifts to the city to participate in the rally. Thousands of colorful flags fluttered in the wind at the venue. Dragon lanterns, flower lanterns, and the vibrant costumes of the minority ethnic groups complemented each other. Cheers and songs echoed in the sky. The entire venue was filled with an atmosphere of joy and unity. The rally began with a welcome speech by General Lu Han. He first expressed a warm welcome and gratitude to Generals Chen Geng and Song Renqiong for leading the People's Liberation Army in its march into Yunnan to annihilate the remaining bandits. He also stated his determination to sincerely implement all decrees of the Central People's Government and the Common Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, and to unite with all sectors and ethnic groups in the province under the direct leadership of Generals Chen and Song to strive for the construction of a new democratic Yunnan. General Chen Geng addressed the people of Kunming amidst sustained cheers and applause. He first explained that the peaceful liberation of Yunnan was mainly due to the wise leadership of the CCP Central Committee, the Central People's Government, and Chairman Mao, the great victory of the People's Liberation Army on a nationwide scale, the long-term struggle of the Communist Party members and people's armed forces in Yunnan, and the result of General Lu Han leading his troops to revolt. After proposing that the entire audience observe a moment of silence in mourning for the heroes who sacrificed themselves for the People's Liberation Army, General Chen Geng pointed out that now that the open enemy armed forces in Yunnan have been annihilated and the period of peaceful construction has arrived, we must strive to build a new Yunnan and a new China. General Chen then pointed out that the task of building a new Yunnan is great and glorious, but there are still difficulties on the road ahead. He said: We believe that relying on the efforts of the people of Yunnan, relying on the great unity of all classes and ethnic groups, and under the leadership of the Central People's Government, the CCP Central Committee, and Chairman Mao, we will surely overcome all difficulties. General Chen Geng finally called on everyone to establish revolutionary order, thoroughly eliminate secret agents and bandits, restore and develop production, carry out cultural and educational work, and strive forward under the leadership of Chairman Mao. In his speech, General Song Renqiong said: Our victory is only the first step in a long march of ten thousand miles, and the heavy task of construction is falling on our shoulders. He called on the people of the province to unite closely, give full play to their wisdom, and overcome all kinds of difficulties under the leadership of Chairman Mao. Following this, General Zhou Baozhong, who had been away from the people of Yunnan for twenty-five years, General Zhuang Tian, Commander of the Dian-Gui-Qian Border Column, and Zhao Bicheng, a representative from all walks of life, spoke in succession. Finally, Shi Dexi, a representative of the Yi ethnic minority, spoke. He said: Under the oppression of the Kuomintang for decades, we have labored for years, but we can only eat corn and wild vegetables, and many women have no pants to wear. We have been eagerly awaiting the arrival of the People's Liberation Army, and today you have come. In the future, we minority ethnic groups will surely unite firmly in the big family of the People's Republic of China and build our new Yunnan under the leadership of Chairman Mao. After the speeches, the conference held a warm and moving flag and gift presentation. The most touching of these was the workers of the 53rd Arsenal, who rushed to manufacture two hundred light machine guns and five hundred compasses to present to the People's Liberation Army. When the workers carried the fruits of their blood and sweat towards the stage, the entire venue erupted in cheers, and the song "We Workers Have Strength" resounded for a long time. After accepting this sincere gift from the worker brothers, General Chen Geng stood up and thanked the workers warmly, and called on the entire army to use these weapons to thoroughly eliminate bandits and secret agents and defend the borders of the motherland in order to answer the aspirations of the worker comrades.
