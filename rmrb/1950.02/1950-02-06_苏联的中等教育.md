　　Soviet Secondary Education
    B. Aleksandrov

　　During the years of Soviet power, more than 220,000 secondary technical and general schools with well-equipped teaching facilities, laboratories, and libraries have been opened in cities and villages of the Soviet republics. Now, 34.5 million children of all nationalities are studying in these schools.

　　The Party and the Soviet government have shown tireless concern for schools. The state's expenditure on national education increases year by year. This year (1949), the expenditure on education reached a huge sum—60.8 billion rubles.

　　General middle schools and secondary specialized schools occupy a significant place in the entire system of secondary education in the Soviet Union. Before the Great October Revolution, there were only 295 vocational schools, with 36,000 students. Now, more than 3,500 secondary specialized schools have been established in the Soviet Union, training 600 different types of skilled workers with specialized technologies. Nearly one million young people studying in these schools are preparing to become middle-level skilled technicians.

　　Some secondary technical schools are training specialized personnel for various sectors of industry, construction, transportation, communications, agriculture, and trade. Medical schools are training middle-level medical personnel (such as pharmacists and midwives), and normal schools are training primary school teachers. The country has opened schools of music, painting, art, dance, drama, navigation, inland waterway navigation, as well as law, surveying secondary schools, and so on. Secondary vocational schools—secondary technical schools, and other secondary specialized schools—continue for three to four years, depending on their specialization. These schools enroll young men and women aged 14 to 30 who have a seven-year school education. Outstanding students can receive state scholarships. The teaching plan of secondary vocational schools is designed to ensure the training of technical personnel with broad cultural and political horizons. Therefore, the teaching plan also includes a series of general education subjects (literature, mathematics, natural sciences, physics, chemistry, etc.), specialized subjects appropriate to the nature of the vocational school, and practical training in laboratories, production, state farms, and factories.

　　In fact, students in secondary vocational schools, while receiving specialized education, also receive a general education as it is conducted in ordinary middle schools. After completing secondary technical schools, normal schools, medical vocational schools, and other schools, and working for more than three years in their specialty, they can continue their education in higher schools (according to their specialty). Many secondary vocational schools have evening and correspondence classes. This enables thousands of working young people to continue their education without having to leave their work in institutions and production.

　　The Soviet secondary education system is fundamentally different from that of Tsarist Russia. In the schools before the revolution, children were forced to digest a large pile of unnecessary, dead, and distorted knowledge. In these schools, according to Lenin, "servants" were educated for the bourgeoisie, "who could give profits to the bourgeoisie without disturbing their peace of mind and laziness." The younger generation trained in these schools unknowingly and skillfully became a batch of bureaucrats. According to the teaching plan of classical middle schools, theology was studied for 16 hours a week, Latin for 42 hours, Greek for 33 hours, while subjects such as mathematics were studied for 29 hours, history for 13 hours, natural sciences for 11 hours, physics for 7 hours, geography for 8 hours, and so on.

　　The education of women was different from that of men. In Tsarist Russia, "the inequality and low status of women were also manifested here: in girls' middle schools, the scope of knowledge imparted to girls was much smaller than that given to boys. After graduating from middle school, a girl could only receive higher education in advanced classes and some public higher schools. Women were not allowed to enter universities and public higher technical schools."

　　The teaching and education system of pre-revolutionary middle schools was deliberately designed to deprive students of their individuality and suppress their independent thinking. A suffocating, formalistic atmosphere dominated the middle schools. Everything living, everything independent, all criticism was persecuted. Excellent Russian professors have stated more than once: "The classical middle school has not proven the hopes it carried and the sacrifices and energy wasted on it."

　　The foundation of Soviet secondary education is based on completely different political, scientific, and educational principles.

　　Soviet middle schools directly grant the educated with reliable knowledge that cannot be matched by pre-revolutionary bourgeois schools, and a very broad, and therefore essentially different kind of socio-political vision. This is achieved, first of all, because in Soviet schools, a lot of time is allocated to the study of general subjects (such as physics, natural sciences, history, mathematics, etc.), and because teaching is conducted on the basis of modern scientific materials, on the basis of the most advanced science—on the basis of Marxism-Leninism.

　　Soviet middle schools are divided into ten grades. Children enter the first grade of middle school at the age of seven and graduate at the age of seventeen.

　　Starting from the fourth grade, middle school students need to pass exams to be promoted to the next grade. At the end of the tenth grade, an examination covering the entire middle school curriculum is held to obtain a middle school diploma. This certificate gives a young person the right to enter a higher school. Students with excellent grades and conduct will be awarded gold and silver medals. Students who have won gold or silver medals can enter higher schools without taking entrance exams.

　　In the Soviet Union, there is a unified national education system, with complete coherence between schools of various levels and higher education institutions at various age stages.

　　The consistency of teaching programs and textbooks, and the education system, enables students to freely transfer to the fifth grade of seven-year schools or middle schools after graduating from primary school, or to the eighth grade of middle school after graduating from seven-year schools.

　　In the Soviet Union, co-education is implemented, but along with separate boys' and girls' middle schools, there are also some middle schools where young men and women are educated together, and students in both boys' and girls' schools can obtain the same scope of general education knowledge. After graduating from middle school, young men and women have the same rights to apply for any higher school.

　　In war conditions, many young people lost the opportunity to receive secondary education. For this reason, the Soviet government established many special schools for young workers. These schools, in terms of their own organization, teaching work time, and system, are designed to enable young people to receive a ten-year middle school education without abandoning production. Now, more than 300,000 young workers are studying in these schools.

　　The mission of Soviet middle schools is to cultivate comprehensively developed, broadly educated, conscious, and active builders of communist society. Its task is to give young people a general education, a solid foundation of basic knowledge of modern science, and promote the deep and comprehensive intellectual, moral, aesthetic, and physical development of the younger generation. All training in secondary schools is educational in nature. Teaching plans and programs, all extracurricular activities, are aimed at educating students in the spirit of Soviet patriotism, socialist humanism, friendship, and respect for the people of all nationalities.

　　Theoretical education is firmly linked to labor education, the education of independence, and the cultivation of various practical skills and experiences necessary for students' lives. The education of cultured behavior, conscious discipline, will, character, etc.—all of these are also subjects of special attention for Soviet educators.

　　The scope and content of education are determined by the national teaching program. The teaching plans and programs of middle schools in the various union republics are compiled by the education departments of these republics, taking into account the characteristics of each nationality. Education is conducted in the students' own national language (education is currently conducted in seventy languages of the Soviet Union). However, Russian must be taught in all schools of all union republics, because Russian ensures the consolidation of brotherly friendship between the various nationalities of the Soviet Union.

　　The teaching plan of Soviet middle schools stipulates the following subjects: national language, literature, Russian, mathematics (arithmetic, algebra, geometry, trigonometry), ancient history, medieval history, modern history and Soviet history, the Soviet Constitution, world natural geography and political geography, Soviet natural geography and economic geography, natural sciences (botany, zoology, anatomy, Darwinism), physics, chemistry, astronomy, foreign languages (choose one of four: English, French, German, and Spanish), painting, drafting, music, physical education. In addition, elementary logic and psychology are now taught in middle schools.

　　The program for each subject presents a task before the teacher—to give students a certain systematic basic knowledge of that science, knowledge that is necessary for a materialist dialectical understanding of the processes and laws that are completed in nature and society. The teaching of any subject leads to the establishment of a materialist worldview in middle school students. Here, the school's teaching program establishes the scope of scientific basic knowledge, abilities, and skilled experience that are necessary for school teaching, and which students should acquire in each year of education, adapting to their age characteristics.

　　Various textbooks are compiled to adapt to these programs. In Soviet schools, unified and fixed textbooks approved by the education departments of each republic are used for teaching. Millions of copies of Soviet textbooks are published every year. For example, according to the decision of the Soviet Council of Ministers, 174 million revised school textbooks should be published for the new school year, and some textbooks are being rewritten with the participation of workers from the Russian Republic Academy of Educational Sciences, which serves as the center of educational science work, using the best methods in the country.

　　In middle schools, classroom lectures are the main way to organize teaching work. Each class has a rigid number of students and attends classes according to a strictly prescribed timetable. Teachers need to provide a systematic and consistent account of the subjects they teach in accordance with the teaching program. Teaching methods depend on the content of the course and the age of the students. But the main thing is to enable students to truly digest the course, get used to the self-study work of textbooks and books, various independent assignments, and practical work in laboratories, research rooms, and school surrounding areas. Teachers widely use physical aids, display instruments, pictures, charts, and show academic films in the teaching process.

　　The broad Soviet public and the workers of higher education institutions point out with great satisfaction that the cultivation of young people in domestic middle schools is improving every year. The knowledge of graduates is becoming more profound and reliable, and they are well and comprehensively prepared to move towards independent life.

　　Soviet higher education institutions enroll 200,000 college students every year, most of whom are graduates of ordinary middle schools.

　　Every school has its own library, which makes students accustomed to reading and establishes reading clubs. Every school has various groups where children go to engage in activities in their spare time after class. Young natural scientists, technicians, geographers, athletes, drama art and modeling art lovers, under the guidance of experienced educators, can engage in studying their subjects of interest. In the past two or three years, young horticulturalists and geographers groups have become extremely popular among students.

　　Popular science lectures, movies, concerts, literary and scientific evenings are regularly held in schools, welcoming lectures from scientists and well-known domestic figures.

　　In every middle school, there is an organization of Young Pioneers, which children from the third to seventh grades voluntarily participate in, and an organization of Communist Youth League, whose members are outstanding students in higher grades. Various student organizations and educators solve the same task: to educate a generation of healthy, comprehensively developed young people.

　　The main role in this work belongs to the teachers. As early as 1925, Stalin wrote in his congratulatory message to the first congress of teachers: "Our workers are now building a new life on a socialist basis, and the people's teaching community is the most indispensable part of our workers' army."

　　Very high expectations are being placed on Soviet teachers. Only teachers with the personal title of "middle school teacher" have the right to teach in middle schools. This title can only be obtained by graduates of educational colleges or universities who are recognized as suitable for educational work. Moreover, those who have only graduated from normal colleges (a two-year study period) only have the right to teach in the first seven grades of middle school. There are 320 higher education schools in the Soviet Union preparing teaching staff for primary and secondary schools. In addition, there are 32 universities in the country preparing skilled teachers. This year, the Ministry of Education of the Russian Federation sent 25,000 young teachers to primary and secondary schools, all of whom graduated from educational colleges or normal colleges.

　　The Party, the government, and the entire Soviet people have entrusted teachers with the task of creating a new cadre of communist builders, and they cherish the labor of the people's teachers, the admirable labor of self-sacrifice. (Translated by Jiang Hong)

　　苏联的中等教育
    Б·亚历山大洛夫
    在苏维埃政权的年代里，苏联各共和国的城市和乡村里，开设了二十二万余所具有良好教学设备的研究室和图书馆的中等工科学校和普通学校，现在有三千四百五十万所有各民族人民的子女在这些学校里求学。
    党和苏维埃政府对于学校表示出始终不倦的关怀。在国民教育方面，国家的开支，年复一年地增长着。今年（一九四九）教育方面的经费达到一个巨大的数额——六百零八亿卢布。
    普通中学校，中等专门学校，在苏联中等教育的整个体系上占着重大的地位。在伟大的十月革命以前，仅只有二百九十五所职业学校，其中有三万六千人学习。现在，在苏联开办了三千五百余所中等专门学校，在这些学校里正培养着六百种不同的、有专门技术的熟练工作者。正在这些学校中学习的将近百万的青年人，正准备成为中等熟练的专门技术人员。
    有些中等工科学校，正为工业、建筑业、运输、通讯、农业、贸易各种不同部门培养专门人材。在医科学校里正在进行中等医务人员（如药剂师、助产士等）的培养，在师范学校里，进行着小学教师的培养。国内开办了音乐、绘画艺术的学校，舞蹈、戏剧、航海、内河航行的学校，以及法律、测量中等学校等等。中等职业学校——中等工科学校，及其他中等专门学校，按其专门知识，课程继续三年至四年。这些学校招收十四岁至三十岁具有七年制学校的教育程度的青年男女。成绩优良的学生可以获得国家的奖学金。中等职业学校的教学计划是为了要保证培养具有宽阔的文化视野和政治视野的专门技术人员。因此教学计划又包括着一系列的普通教育的课目（文学、数学、自然科学、物理、化学及其他等等），与该职业学校的性质相适应的专门课目，以及在实验室里，在生产中，在国营农场中，工厂中的生产实习。
    事实上，中等职业学校的学生与受专门教育同时也获得了如像在普通中学所进行的一般的教育。修完了中等工科学校、师范学校、医学专科学校以及其他等学校，按自己的专长工作三年以上，此后就可以到高级学校继续自己的教育（按自己的专门）。有许多中等职业学校设有夜班和函授班。这就使成千成万的在职青年能够继续受到教育，而不必脱离在机关里和在生产中的工作。
    苏联的中等教育制度是与沙皇俄国的在根本上不同的。在革命以前的中学校里，孩子们被迫去消化一大堆不需要的、死的和歪曲真理的知识。在这些学校里，按照列宁的话，是替资产阶级教育“奴才，他们能够给与资产阶级利润，而且不惊动他们的安然自在和怠惰成性。”在这些学校里训练出来的青年一代，不知不觉地、很巧妙地变成了一批官僚。按照古典中学的教学计划，每周学习神学十六小时，拉丁文四十二小时，希腊文三十三小时，而学习那些课目，如数学则为二十九小时，历史十三小时，自然科学十一小时，物理七小时，地理八小时等等。
    妇女的教育是与男子的教育不同的。在沙皇俄国，“妇女地位之不平等和低下，也在这里表现出来：在女子中学内，授给女子的知识的范围要比男子小得多。一个女孩子在中学毕业后，只能在高级班和若干公共的高级学校受高等教育。在各大学和公立的高级工科学校里，女子是不能进去的。”
    革命前的中学的教学和教育制度是故意地适应于剥夺学生的个性，压制其思想的独立自主。窒息的、形式化的气氛支配了各中等学校。所有活生生的东西，所有的独立自主，所有的批评都遭受迫害。俄罗斯的优秀的教授们曾不止一次地表示：“古典中学没有证明它所背负的希望及浪费于它的牺牲与精力。”
    苏联的中等教育的基础，是建立在完全不同的政治、科学和教育的原则上的。
    苏联的中学直接地授予受教育者以革命前资产阶级学校所给予者不可以拟的牢靠的知识，以及极宽广的，因此在本质上更是另外的一种社会——政治的视界。这之所以能达到，首先是由于在苏维埃的学校中，分配很多的时间学习一般的课目（如像物理，自然科学，历史，数学等等），并由于教学进行是以现代的科学材料为基础，以最先进的科学为基础——以马列主义为基础。
    苏联的中学校分为十个班次。小孩子们从七岁起进中学一年级，到十七岁毕业。
    从四年级开始，中学学生升级时需经过考试。十年级读完时，要举行一次包括全部中学课程的考试而得到一张中学毕业证书。这张证书给一个青年人以进入高级学校的权利。品学兼优的学生，将授以金质和银质的奖章。获得金质或是银质奖章的学生得不经过入学试验而升入高级学校。
    在苏联存在着一个统一的国民教育系统，存在着各种不同的年龄阶段的各级学校和高等学校之间的完整的连贯。
    教学纲领和课本的一致，教育的制度能够使在小学毕业以后自由转入七年制学校或中学的五年级，或者在七年制学校毕业后，转入中学八年级。
    在苏联实行分校教育，但是同分开的男子中学和女子中学并存的，尚有些男女青年在一起进行教育的中学，并且男学校和女学校的学生都能获得相同的一般教育知识的范围，在中学毕业后，青年男女投考任何一个高级学校，都享有相同的权利。
    在战争情况下，很多青年失去了受中学教育的机会，为此苏维埃政府创办许多特别的青年工人学校。这些学校依其本身的组织，教学工作的时间和制度，都是为了要适应使青年们不放弃生产而能够受到十年制中学校教育的程度。现在有三十余万青年工人在这些学校里学习。
    苏联中学校的使命是培植各方面发展的、受过广泛教育的、有自觉意识的和积极的共产主义社会的建设者。它的任务就是给青年人一种普通教育，牢靠的现代科学的基本知识，促进青年的一代的深刻和全面性的智力、道德、美学和体育各方面的发展。在中等学校里所有的训练，都具有教育的性质。教学计划和纲领，一切课外活动，都具有以苏维埃爱国主义的精神，以社会主义的人道主义，友爱和尊重各民族人民的精神教育学生的目的。
    理论上的教育是与劳动教育，独立自主性的教育，养成学生生活所必需各种不同的实际的熟练经验牢牢地连系着的。有教养的行为，自觉的纪律性，意志，性格等的教育——这一切同样都是苏维埃教育家特别注意的课题。
    教育的范围与内容决定于国家的教学纲领。各加盟共和国中学的教学计划与纲领由这些共和国教育部照顾各民族的特点编定。以学生的自己民族的语言进行教育（教育现正以苏联各民族的七十种言语进行）。但是在所有各加盟共和国的学校中必须教俄文，因为俄文保证苏联各民族间兄弟般友爱的巩固。
    苏联中学的教学计划规定有下列各课目：民族语言，文学，俄文，数学（算术、代数、几何、三角），古代史，中世纪史，现代史和苏联历史，苏联宪法，世界自然地理及政治地理，苏联自然地理及经济地理，自然科学（植物学、动物学、解剖学、达尔文主义），物理，化学，天文学，外国语文（四种任选一种：英、法、德及西班牙文），绘画，制图，音乐，体育。此外，在中学校里，现在讲授初级逻辑学和心理学。
    每一个课目的纲领在教师的面前提出一个任务——要给学生该门科学的一定系统基本知识，对于在自然界和社会中所完成的过程和规律性的唯物辩证的概念是必要的那些知识。任何一个课目的讲授都是引向中学生的唯物论的世界观的建立的。这里，学校的教学纲领建立对学校讲授是必然的，严格划定的科学基本知识、能力、熟练经验的范围，学生在适应自己年龄特点的每年教育中应当获得这样个范围。
    各种教科书的适应这些纲领而编定。在苏联各学校内，采取各共和国教育部批准的统一的固定的教科书进行讲授。苏联的教科书每年出版数以百万册计。譬如，按照苏联部长会议的决定，新学年应当出版一亿七千四百万部经过重新修正的学校教科书，而有些课本是由作为教育科学工作中心的俄罗斯共和国教育科学研究院的工作者们之参加，而以国内最优良的方法重新编定的。
    在中学，课堂讲课是教学工作组织的主要方式。每一班都有硬性的学生名额而且按照严格规定的课程表上课。教师需要对他所授课目有一个符合教学纲领的、有系统的和一贯的讲叙。教学的方法依赖于课程的内容和学生们的年龄。但主要的，还是要使学生们真正的消化课程，习惯于对教科书和书籍的自修工作、各种独自的作业、在实验室、研究室和学校附近地区的实习工作。教师在教学过程中广泛地采用实物帮助，展示仪器、画片、图表、放映学业影片等。
    广大的苏维埃的公众和高等学校的工作者，怀着巨大满意的心情，指出国内中学青年的修养，每年都在改进着。毕业生的知识日益渊深和真实可靠，他们已很好地、各方面地准备好走向独立自主的生活。
    苏联高等学校每年招收二十万大学生，其中大部分是普通中学毕业生。
    在每一个学校里都有自己的图书馆，它使学生们习惯于阅读，并建立读书会。每一个学校里都有各种不同的团体，孩子们在课外空闲时间便到那里去从事活动。年青的自然科学家，技师，地理学家，体育家，戏剧艺术和造型艺术的爱好者，在有经验的教育家指导之下，可以从事学习他们的有兴趣的科目。在最近两三年中，青年园艺学家和地理学家团体在学生们中间极为普遍。
    校内定期地举办通俗科学讲演，电影，音乐会，文艺及科学晚会，欢迎科学家和国内知名人仕的讲演。
    在每一个中学校里，都有少年先锋队的组织，三年级至七年级的儿童自愿地参加它，还有少共青年团的组织，其团员都是高年级的优秀学生。学生的各种组织与教育家同样解决这样同一个任务：教育康健的、各方面发展的青年的一代。
    这件工作中主要的角色是属于教师的。斯大林还在一九二五年便在自己对第一次教师代表大会的贺词中写过：“我国劳动者们现正在社会主义基础之上建设新的生活，而人民教师界是我国劳动者大军的最不可缺的一部分。”
    对于苏维埃教师正有着非常高的期望。只有那些具有“中学教师”个人称衔的教师方有在中学教书的权利。这个称衔是由毕业于教育学院或大学并被公认适合于教育工作者方可取得的。而且，那些仅仅毕业于师范学院（学习期限二年）的人，只有权在中学初级七班中教书。在苏联有三百二十个高级教育学校为中小学校准备师资干部。除此以外，国内还有三十二个大学也在准备熟练的教师。今年俄罗斯联邦共和国教育部便派到中小学校二万五千个青年教师，他们都毕业于教育学院或师范学院。
    党、政府及全体苏维埃人民曾付托给教师以造就共产主义建设者新干部的任务，他们对于人民教师的劳动，自我献身的令人尊敬的劳动，异常珍视。（蒋虹译）
