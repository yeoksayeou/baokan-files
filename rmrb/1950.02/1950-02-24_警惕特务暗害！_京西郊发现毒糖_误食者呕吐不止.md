　　Beware of Special Agent Sabotage!
　　Poisoned Candy Discovered in Western Suburbs of Beijing; Victims Vomit Uncontrollably
　　[Beijing News] Recently, incidents of citizens in the western suburbs of Beijing being poisoned by eating poisoned candy have occurred. Jia Wenrui, resident of No. 5, Xing Shiko, under the jurisdiction of the Western Suburban Public Security Bureau, found a small package of black and white sugar at around 8:00 AM on January 25th, near the corner of the outer wall of his house. It was wrapped in three layers of paper: the first layer was newspaper, the second was green grid paper, and the third was bean paper, weighing about two or three taels. His niece, Wei Xiuying (15 years old), and his mother, Jia Xi Shi (62 years old), each ate a little of the found sugar, and about half an hour later, both began to vomit uncontrollably. On the same day, at 11:00 AM, Zhang Shuying (15 years old), daughter of Zhang Wanchun, resident of No. 41, Xixiazhuang, also found a similar package of sugar outside her door. Zhang Shuying and her parents, younger brother, and younger sister, after eating the sugar, all felt confused, had headaches, and vomited uncontrollably. Zhang Wanchun at this time realized that it must be special agents poisoning and harming the people. He sent the remaining sugar to the Beijing Municipal Health Bureau Testing Laboratory for testing. The test results confirmed that it contained arsenic poison. This extremely wicked behavior of the special agent elements has aroused extreme hatred among the people. In addition to strict investigation by the Municipal Public Security Bureau, it also hopes that citizens will raise their vigilance to avoid being harmed by special agents.

　　警惕特务暗害！
    京西郊发现毒糖  误食者呕吐不止
    【北京讯】京市西郊最近发生市民误食毒糖中毒事件。西郊公安分局管界杏石口五号住户贾文瑞，在一月二十五日上午八点多钟，在他的住房外墙角下，拾得黑、白糖一小包，用三层纸包着，第一层是报纸，第二层是绿格纸，第三层是豆纸，约有二、三两重。他的外甥女魏秀英（十五岁）和他的母亲贾席氏（六十二岁）先后把拾得的糖吃了一点，约有半小时的工夫，二人都一齐呕吐不止。又同日午前十一点钟，西下庄四十一号住户张万春之女张淑英（十五岁），在门外也拾得同样糖包，张淑英和她的父母弟弟妹妹将糖吃后，都感觉心乱头痛并呕吐不止。张万春此时已想到一定又是特务在放毒暗害老百姓，便将剩下的糖送到北京市卫生局试验所化验，化验结果证实其中含有砷毒（即砒礵）。特务分子这种万恶的行为引起人民极端痛恨。市公安局除已严密查缉外，并希望市民提高警惕，免遭特务暗害。
