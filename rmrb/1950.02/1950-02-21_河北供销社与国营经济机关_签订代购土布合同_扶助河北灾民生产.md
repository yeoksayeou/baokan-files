The Hebei Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative, in order to restore production in disaster areas, has recently signed contracts with state-owned economic organizations to guarantee the supply of raw materials and the marketing of finished products in disaster areas. On February 10th, the Hebei Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative signed a contract with the Ministry of Finance of the Central People's Government to purchase 50 million square feet of homespun cloth, including eight types of cloth samples from Tianjin, Tongxian, Cangxian and other special districts. The contract stipulates that for every 49 square feet of cloth purchased, the cooperative will receive a handling fee of two liang of rice. The delivery time is set from April 15th to June 15th, with one-third of the cloth to be delivered in each of the three batches. According to this task, the Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative has allocated 42.95 million square feet to be purchased in the three heavily affected areas of Tianjin, Cangxian, and Tongxian. The remainder is planned to be allocated to Hengshui, Baoding, Dingxian and other special districts. It is estimated that each bolt of cloth can earn a net profit of about ten jin of coarse grains (including the processes of carding, pressing, spinning, and weaving), which can solve part of the people's livelihood problems. In order to open up the sales of mirabilite, the Hebei Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative signed a contract with the North China Chemical Company on February 15th to purchase 30 million jin of mirabilite. Each jin of mirabilite can be exchanged for about half a jin of coarse grains (including the processes of production and transportation). The quality standard stipulates that the pure mirabilite content should be between 39% and 44%. For those exceeding the quality, the price will be increased proportionally. The contract stipulates that the cooperative is responsible for the transportation costs from the mirabilite production area to Tianjin, and the company is responsible for the transportation costs from Tianjin to the factory. The Provincial Cooperative has allocated this amount of mirabilite to the disaster areas of Tianjin, Tongxian, Tangshan, Hengshui, and Baoding according to the severity of the disaster. In addition, the Provincial Cooperative recently signed a contract with the Northeast Supply and Marketing Cooperative to purchase 80,000 mats, with each mat bringing a net profit of three jin of coarse grains to the disaster victims. Under the leadership of the cooperative, Anxin, Jinghai, Wen'an, Dacheng, Shengfang, Baodi and other counties are widely organizing mat makers to carry out production for self-relief.
    [Another News Item] In order to support the textile industry production in the disaster areas of Hebei Province, the North China Yarn and Cloth Company has decided to lend 1,500 pieces of 10-count yarn and 1,200 pieces of 20-count yarn to the disaster areas for production every month starting from February through the cooperatives. The supply areas are Tangshan, Tongxian, Cangxian, Baoding and other special districts.
    [Another News Item] In order to support the production of mirabilite by disaster victims in the province, the Pingyuan Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative has also signed a contract with the North China Chemical Company to purchase 20 million jin of mirabilite. The contract stipulates that each jin of mirabilite will be converted into half a jin of millet; the delivery period is from March to May, and the delivery will be made in three batches, and the millet will be prepaid in batches. The cooperative is responsible for the transportation costs from the province to Tianjin, and the company is responsible for the transportation costs from Tianjin to the factory.
