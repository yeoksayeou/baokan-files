　　Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 19th. Leaders of various democratic political parties and social organizations in Korea have successively issued statements on the 17th and 18th, warmly welcoming the signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance. Park Chang-ok, Minister of the Propaganda and Agitation Department of the Central Committee of the Workers' Party, said: The treaty and agreements signed between the Soviet Union and China are not only matters for the Soviet Union and China. It is also of great significance to the struggle of the people of the world for peace and security and the struggle of the oppressed people in colonial and dependent countries. It is a strong guarantee for peace and security in Asia and the world. The Korean people welcome the Sino-Soviet treaty and agreements with the same excitement as celebrating their own victory.

　　Choi Yong-kun, Chairman of the North Korean Democratic Party, said: The treaty and agreements between the Soviet Union and China are new historical documents guaranteeing peace and security in Asia and the world. This is a head-on blow to the rumor-mongering imperialists. The power of the friendly mutual assistance between the Soviet Union and China, which has a population of 700 million, coupled with the world's forces for peace, will surely defeat the aggressive forces of imperialism. The Korean people, who are fighting for the peaceful reunification of their motherland, are inspired by the great victory of the friendly relations between the Soviet Union and China, and will strengthen the struggle to expel the aggressive forces of American imperialism and eliminate the traitor Syngman Rhee with the conviction of certain victory.

　　Choi Kyung-duk, Chairman of the General Federation of Trade Unions of North Korea, said: The conclusion of the Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance and other agreements between the great Soviet Union, the powerful fortress of world peace and democracy, and the People's Republic of China, which accounts for a quarter of the world's population, is a great contribution to the cause of peace, security and progress for all mankind, and is a heavy blow to the American imperialists who are attempting to rearm Japan in order to instigate war against the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries. The Korean working class warmly welcomes and supports these treaties and agreements and extends its heartfelt congratulations.

　　The heads of the North Korean Farmers' League, the Democratic Youth League, the Democratic Women's League, the Cheondoist Chongu Party, the Working People's Party, the Social Democratic Party, the People's Republican Party, and the Democratic Independence Party also issued statements, unanimously hailing the conclusion of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance and the two agreements.
