　　Malayan Guerrillas Win Attack on British Police Patrol
    British Imperialism Admits Invasion War Has Bleak Prospects
    [Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, February 4th] Malayan guerrillas are actively fighting in states such as Johor and Perak. According to British official sources reported by Singapore's Nanyang Siang Pau: On January 6th, guerrillas ambushed a British colonial authority's police forest patrol team in the Batu Gajah area of Perak, killing the leading police chief and seriously wounding two police officers. On January 8th, guerrillas attacked a Gurkha mercenary mortar unit of the British mercenary forces in the Segamat area of Johor, killing one sentry and wounding one officer. On January 9th, guerrillas attacked a police patrol team in the Mouth area of Negeri Sembilan, wounding nine police officers.
    According to statistics from the British colonial authorities: In the year and a half from the declaration of the "Emergency Ordinance" in June 1948 to the end of 1949, the British army suffered a total loss of 363 army personnel in the war against the Malayan guerrillas, including 149 dead and 212 wounded, of which 17 British officers were killed and 15 wounded.
    [Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, February 4th] The British colonial authorities in Malaya admitted that the war against the Malayan people has very bleak prospects. According to Agence France-Presse, London: The Manchester Guardian wrote on January 31st in a commentary on the situation in Malaya: General Harding, Commander-in-Chief of the British Army in the Far East, said that there are currently no signs of the end of the Malayan War. This is different from the statement a year ago. A year ago, we often heard words like: In another three or four months, everything will be settled, but now, this is no longer said. According to New York Herald Tribune reporter Steele in his Malayan correspondence, he admitted that driving the guerrillas out of the deep forests "is still a long-term job." He said: Bowser, the British military commander in Malaya, believes that the anti-communist war can be ended in another two years. However, no one in Singapore agrees with "such optimistic estimates."

　　袭击英警察巡逻队  马来亚游击队获胜
    英帝招认侵略战前途渺茫
    【新华社北京四日电】马来亚游击队在柔佛和霹雳等邦积极作战。据新加坡南侨日报载英官方消息透露：游击队于一月六日在霹雳的华都加牙区袭击英殖民当局的警察森林巡逻队，将领队警长击毙，并重伤警察两名。一月八日，游击队在柔佛的昔加末区袭击英国雇佣军廓尔喀军的臼炮部队，击毙哨兵一名，击伤军官一人。一月九日，游击队又袭击森美兰的马口区警察巡逻队，击伤警察九名。
    另据英国殖民地当局统计：自一九四八年六月宣布《紧急法令》至一九四九年年底止的一年半内，英军在对马来亚游击队作战中总共损失陆军三百六十三人，计死一百四十九人，伤二百十二人，其中英籍军官死十七人，伤十五人。
    【新华社北京四日电】马来亚的英国殖民地当局承认：对马来亚人民进行的战争，前途甚为渺茫。据法新社伦敦消息：曼彻斯特卫报于一月三十一日在评论马来亚形势时写道：英驻远东陆军总司令哈丁将军说，马来亚战争目前尚无结束的迹象。这与一年前的说法不一样。一年前，我们常常听到这样的话：再过三四个月，一切就都会办妥了，而现在，已不这样说了。另据纽约先驱论坛报记者斯蒂尔在其马来亚通讯中承认：要把游击队从森林深处赶走，“仍是一个长期的工作”，他说：马来亚英军司令鲍雪尔相信，反共战争再过两年就可以结束。但是，新加坡无人同意“这样乐观的估计”。
