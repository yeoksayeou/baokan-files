Xinhua News Agency, Dihua, 5th: After Mark C. Hinnan, former Vice Consul of the American Consulate in Dihua, was exposed for colluding with Xinjiang bandits Usman and others in an attempt to carry out espionage activities against the Chinese people, people of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang unanimously expressed their indignation at the vile crimes of American imperialism. Ainiwar Baba, one of the leaders of the Xinjiang Peace and Democracy League, said: "The bandit Usman and others have been undermining the interests of the people in the Ili, Altai, and Tacheng regions for a long time. Now, this group of bandits, under the direction and support of American imperialism and Chiang Kai-shek's bandits, is carrying out conspiracies to sabotage peace in Xinjiang. The people of Xinjiang resolutely oppose such despicable crimes, and we must thoroughly eliminate these reactionary elements." Hasannov, Deputy Chief of Staff of the Xinjiang Military Region, said: "This fact proves that American imperialism and the Kuomintang remnants are the deadly enemies of the Chinese people. The Soviet Union is the true friend of the Chinese people. The people of China and the Soviet Union will forever join hands to defend world peace and people's democracy, and oppose imperialism and reactionaries to the end." Ni Diande, Deputy Secretary-General of the Xinjiang Provincial People's Government and a progressive member of the Kazakh ethnic group, pointed out the crimes of the Usman bandits in looting, killing, and destroying everywhere under the direction of American imperialism and Chiang Kai-shek's bandits, and said: "The people of Xinjiang should unite more closely and, under the leadership of the People's Government, eliminate these reactionary fellows."
	The person in charge of the Preparatory Committee of the Dihua City Federation of Trade Unions said: We, the more than 10,000 workers in the city, must organize, raise our vigilance, strengthen security work in factories, and crush the sabotage conspiracies of American spies, Kuomintang secret agents, and the Usman bandits. In addition, the heads of people's organizations such as students, youth, and women have also unanimously condemned the conspiracy activities of American imperialism and called for increased vigilance. In response, the Xinjiang Daily published an editorial on January 31, denouncing the conspiracy of American imperialism and calling on the people of all ethnic groups in the province to unite, be highly vigilant, and eliminate the Kuomintang bandit remnants, American spies and special agents, and reactionary elements within the territory.
