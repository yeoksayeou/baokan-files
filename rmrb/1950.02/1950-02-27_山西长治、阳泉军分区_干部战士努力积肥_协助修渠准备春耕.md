Shanxi Changzhi and Yangquan Military Subdistricts

Cadres and Soldiers Strive to Accumulate Fertilizer and Assist in Ditch Repair to Prepare for Spring Plowing

[Report from our Shanxi correspondent] The cadres and soldiers of the Changzhi and Yangquan Military Subdistricts in Shanxi Province are actively accumulating fertilizer, buying tools, and exchanging seeds to make material preparations for this year's agricultural production. In January, the Production Committee of the Changzhi Military Subdistrict issued a call to all commanders and fighters of the subdistrict to accumulate 30 loads of fertilizer per person. All cadres and soldiers of the headquarters and political department of the subdistrict enthusiastically responded. The seven people in the Education Section of the Political Department accumulated 250 loads of fertilizer in ten days, exceeding the original plan. The 36 cadres and soldiers of the Health Section accumulated 1,200 loads of fertilizer in half a month. All cadres and soldiers of the subdistrict's headquarters and political organs accumulated 3,750 loads of fertilizer in half a month, with many departments exceeding the plan of 30 loads. The main method of accumulating fertilizer is to seize all opportunities, accumulate small amounts into large amounts, and work hard over the long term. For example, Instructor Ma Hanzhong of the Health Section led the nursing class to regularly clean up garbage and compost manure. Whenever they had time, they would pick up manure on the streets. In half a month, they exceeded the original plan. They are now planning to remove manure from the latrines every half month and from the livestock pens every ten days, and have assigned dedicated personnel to be responsible for scientific management in order to increase fertilizer in preparation for spring plowing. The cadres and soldiers of the Independent Battalion of the Yangquan Military Subdistrict are working hard to find land, purchase farm tools, and exchange seeds. At the end of last month, the battalion accepted the task of helping the local farmers dig ditches. The companies held separate discussions, and the soldiers made personal plans to strive to become heroes and models in ditch digging. Since construction began on the 26th of last month until the 8th of this month, they have successfully completed the task of helping the farmers repair the ditches. They spent a total of 3,002 workdays and dug more than 3,000 cubic meters of ditches, which was warmly supported by the local masses. After the ditch repair was completed, the battalion immediately began to work hard to prepare for spring plowing.
