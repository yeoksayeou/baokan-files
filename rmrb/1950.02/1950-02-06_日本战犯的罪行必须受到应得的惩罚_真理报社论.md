Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, February 5th - TASS Moscow, February 4th: Pravda published an editorial entitled "The Crimes of Japanese War Criminals Must Receive Due Punishment," stating: On February 1st, the Soviet government sent notes to the governments of the United States, the United Kingdom, and the People's Republic of China, proposing that a special international military tribunal be appointed in the near future to try Japanese war criminals, including Emperor Hirohito and Ishii, Kitano, Wakamatsu, and Kasahara, who committed the greatest crime against humanity – preparing and using bacteriological weapons.

Based on irrefutable facts, the Soviet government exposed to the world the crimes committed by the main organizers and instigators of germ warfare. The towering crimes of the Japanese imperialists, who used the most barbaric means of aggression, were exposed last December during the trial in Khabarovsk of Yamada, Takatsu, Kajitsuka, and other Japanese war criminals.

The Kwantung Army headquarters in Manchuria, acting under the direct orders of Emperor Hirohito, the Japanese Army Ministry, and the General Staff Headquarters, established special bacteriological units. These factories of death produced large quantities of deadly bacteria, shells and equipment for spreading bacteria. In addition, they organized troops to cause mass infection of the population and spread bacteria in houses, water sources, fields, and livestock. Japanese war criminals planned to poison the people of the Soviet Union, China, and the Mongolian People's Republic, and the American army, with billions of bacteria and germs. They experimented on thousands of people – citizens of China, the Soviet Union, and other countries – with weapons of mass slaughter. In just one of these units, those murderers in generals' and officers' uniforms cruelly tortured more than three thousand people to death. The documents of the Khabarovsk trial prove that in several instances, Japanese militarists used bacteriological weapons against the Mongolian People's Republic and China, conducting barbaric expeditions and causing epidemics.

Twelve Japanese war criminals who committed the crime of preparing and using bacteriological weapons have already received their due punishment. However, justice has not yet been served for the main organizers and instigators of these monstrous crimes, first and foremost Emperor Hirohito and Generals Ishii, Kitano, Wakamatsu, and Kasahara, who have not yet been punished. The conscience of the people cannot tolerate these people remaining at large. The testimony of the defendants during the Khabarovsk trials revealed that Emperor Hirohito was one of the main participants in preparing for bacteriological warfare against the Soviet Union, China, the Mongolian People's Republic, the United States, the United Kingdom, and other countries. It was Hirohito who secretly ordered the establishment of Unit 731 in 1936, which became the center of the Japanese army's preparation for bacteriological warfare and the use of bacteriological weapons. Japanese General Ishii, a former active organizer and instigator of bacteriological warfare, is now being sheltered in the headquarters of the American occupation forces in Japan. Ishii himself led bacteriological expeditionary forces to China in 1940-1942. Under his instigation, the Japanese warlords used bacteriological weapons in the Khalkhin Gol area during a vicious offensive against the Mongolian People's Republic, which was friendly to the Soviet Union. The Khabarovsk trials also confirmed that Japanese war criminal General Kitano presided over the preparations for bacteriological warfare and participated in the bacteriological warfare expeditionary forces to China in 1942. General Wakamatsu also ranks among those who committed the most inhumane crimes. He ordered the dispatch of intelligence organizations – sabotage teams – to the Triretsky area and the Hailar area. The Khabarovsk trial revealed that former Chief of Staff of the Japanese Kwantung Army, General Kasahara, was one of the leading figures in the preparation for bacteriological warfare against the Soviet Union at that time.

Pravda emphasized that if the sinister plans of Japanese imperialism had not been crushed by the Soviet Union and the Soviet Army, then a large-scale bacteriological war and all its terrible consequences for humanity could have become a dreadful reality. The heroic Soviet Army inflicted a devastating blow on the Japanese aggressors, crushed the Kwantung Army, and forced Japan to surrender unconditionally. Under the leadership of the great Stalin, the Soviet people saved humanity and culture from the barbarity of Hitler and the terrible crimes prepared by Japanese imperialism.

The editorial continued: The Soviet government believes that the organizers and instigators who have committed heinous crimes against humanity should receive due punishment. The Soviet government's note is filled with great concern for peace-loving nations, protecting them from the scourge of new wars and the disaster of the use of barbaric methods of mass destruction of people by imperialist bandits.

The Soviet government's demand to punish the main Japanese war criminals is fully in line with previous international obligations. It is well known that all those who participated in the fight against Hitler's fascism and Japanese imperialism had assured the people that war criminals who violated universally recognized international practices and committed crimes against peaceful people would not escape the severe punishment they deserved. In 1943, the heads of government of the Soviet Union, the United States, and the United Kingdom, in their declaration, stated that war criminals must be brought to justice no matter where they flee, so that justice may be served. The Soviet government demands that Japanese war criminals who have committed the most inhumane crimes against humanity be brought to justice.

Anyone who firmly cherishes peace will firmly insist on the immediate implementation of the agreement stipulating that all war criminals should be severely punished. All the peace-loving people of the world demand the complete destruction of aggressive forces. Punishing all the main war criminals means dealing a new blow to the instigators of war.

The Pravda editorial concluded: The Soviet government's note to the governments of the United States, the United Kingdom, and China has been welcomed with deep satisfaction by the Soviet people and all peace-loving nations. They see it as yet another new proof of the Soviet Union's unremitting struggle for world peace and against the instigators of new wars.

### 日本战犯的罪行必须受到应得的惩罚  真理报社论

　　日本战犯的罪行必须受到应得的惩罚
    【新华社北京五日电】塔斯社莫斯科四日讯：真理报以《日本战犯的罪行必须受到应得的惩罚》为题发表社论称：二月一日，苏联政府照会美国、英国与中华人民共和国政府，建议在最近的将来指派特别国际军事法庭，将犯有对人类最大罪行——准备与使用细菌武器——的日皇裕仁与石井、北野、若松及笠原等日本战犯提交该法庭审讯。
    苏联政府根据无可辩驳的事实，在全世界面前揭露了细菌战主要组织者及鼓动者所犯的罪行。日本帝国主义者使用一种最野蛮的侵略手段，他们的滔天罪行已于去年十二月伯力举行的对山田、高笃、梶冢及其他日本战犯的公审中暴露出来了。
    满洲的关东军司令部，奉日皇裕仁、日本陆军省与参谋本部的直接训令，曾建立了特别的细菌部队。这些死亡制造厂生产了大量的致命的细菌、散播细菌用的炮弹与设备，另外，还组织了部队，以使居民大批染受传染病，并在住房、水源、田野与牲畜身上散播细菌。日本战犯准备以亿万细菌与病菌毒害苏联、中国及蒙古人民共和国的人民与美国军队，他们以成千的人民——中国、苏联及其他国家的公民来试验大规模屠杀的武器。仅在这种部队的一个部队中，那些身着将军服与军官服的杀人魔王，便把三千多人民残酷地折磨死了。伯力审判的文件证明：在若干场合，日本军国主义者对蒙古人民共和国与中国使用了细菌武器，进行了野蛮的远征，并引起传染病的流行。
    十二名犯有准备与使用细菌武器罪的日本战犯，已经受到应有的惩罚。但是，对这种滔天罪行的主要组织者与鼓动者，首先是日皇裕仁与石井、北野、若松及笠原四将军，正义尚未申张，他们仍未受到惩办。人民的天良是不能容忍这些人逍遥法外的。伯力审讯时，被告的供词暴露了日皇裕仁是准备对苏联、中国、蒙古人民共和国、美国、英国及其他国家进行细菌战的主要参加者之一。正是裕仁，他在一九三六年秘密下令建立了七三一部队，这支部队变成了日本军队准备细菌战及使用细菌武器的中心。日本石井将军以前是细菌战的积极组织者与鼓动者，现在则在日境美国占领军总部中受到庇护。石井本人在一九四○——四二年便曾率领细菌派遣军至中国。在他的策动之下，日本军阀对与苏联友好的蒙古人民共和国发动凶恶进攻时，曾在哈尔新——葛尔河地区使用了细菌武器。伯力的审判又证实了日本战犯北野将军曾主持过细菌战的准备工作，并且在一九四二年还参加过对华细菌战派遣军。若松将军也列身于那些犯了最惨无人道的罪恶的人们的行列中。他曾指令派出谍报组织——阴谋破坏队到特里列奇区和海拉尔地区去。在伯力审判中暴露出：前日本关东军参谋长笠原将军是当时准备对苏细菌战的首脑人物之一。
    真理报着重指出：假如日本帝国主义的罪恶计划，未被苏联和苏军粉碎的话，则大规模的细菌战争及其对人类的一切可怖后果，恐已成为可怕的现实。英勇的苏军，对日本侵略者施以毁灭性的打击，他们打垮了关东军而迫使日本无条件投降。苏联人民在伟大的斯大林领导之下，从希特勒的野蛮残暴中和日本帝国主义所准备的可怕的罪恶中，拯救了人类、拯救了文化。
    社论继而指出：苏联政府认为，对人类犯有滔天罪行的组织者与鼓动者，应受到应得的惩罚。苏联政府的照会，充满了对爱好和平民族的伟大关怀，保卫他们使免于新战争的灾害、免于帝国主义匪徒利用野蛮方法大量毁灭人民的灾害。
    苏联政府之要求惩罚主要的日本战犯，完全符合于以前所承担的国际义务。众所周知，所有参加反希特勒法西斯主义和反日本帝国主义斗争的人们，曾向人民保证过：凡破坏普遍承认的国际惯例和对和平的人民犯有罪行的战犯，都不能逃脱他们应得的严厉的惩罚。在一九四三年，苏联、美国和英国三国政府的首脑，在他们的宣言中宣称：战争罪犯无论他们逃至天涯海角，一定要使他们归案法办，俾正义得以申张。苏联政府要求：对人类犯有最惨无人道的罪恶的日本战犯，应予归案法办。
    任何一个坚决珍爱和平的人，都会坚主立即履行规定要严惩所有战犯的协定。全世界拥护和平的人，都要求彻底打垮侵略力量。惩罚所有主要的战犯，即意味着给予战争制造者以新的打击。
    真理报社论的结语称：苏联政府致美、英、中三国政府的照会，已经受到苏联人民和所有爱好和平的民族深为满意的欢迎。他们认为这是苏联拥护世界和平反对新战争挑拨者而进行的不懈的斗争之又一新的证明。
