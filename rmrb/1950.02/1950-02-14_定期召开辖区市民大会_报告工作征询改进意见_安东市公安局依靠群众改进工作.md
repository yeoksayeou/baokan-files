    Regularly Convene Neighborhood Citizen Assemblies, Report on Work, Solicit Improvement Opinions
    Andong City Public Security Bureau Relies on the Masses to Improve Work
    Three Experiences in Holding Good Citizen Assemblies
    [Xinhua News Agency, Andong, February 12th] The Andong City People's Government Public Security Bureau, using the police station as the unit, regularly convenes neighborhood citizen assemblies to report work to the citizens, solicit opinions for improvement, and has achieved significant results in strengthening public security work and reforming old police. Since the city abolished the district and street government organizations in June of last year to strengthen public security police stations, the police stations experienced a serious phenomenon of being divorced from the masses because the working methods failed to adapt to the new organizational situation in a timely manner, and some old public security personnel still retained the thinking and style of oppressing the people. Based on these circumstances, the City Public Security Bureau, in addition to conducting ideological education for all public security personnel, also adopted the practice of regularly convening general assemblies of all public security personnel from September, commending model workers who closely contacted the masses and cared for the interests of the people, and criticizing staff who violated discipline, thus gradually changing the work style of public security personnel, and the citizens' understanding of public security personnel also initially improved. On this basis, all public security police stations in the city also generally convened citizen assemblies in their respective jurisdictions in November of last year. At the meetings, the persons in charge of the police stations first reported and reviewed their work, and separately commended the model deeds of public security personnel in implementing government decrees and criticized examples of certain public security personnel violating discipline, and then sincerely solicited opinions from the citizens on improving public security work. Because the attitude of the persons in charge of the police stations was practical and sincere, the enthusiasm of the masses was greatly enhanced. According to statistics from twenty-five police stations, these meetings received a total of 593 opinions and suggestions from citizens on public security organs, municipal governments, and other organs, factories, and cooperatives, including 121 criticisms and corrections of the work style of the old police, and 70 suggestions on the work of the police stations. After this assembly, the general public in each jurisdiction changed their traditional fear and distrust of the old police, had a correct understanding of the people's public security work, and thus automatically supervised the public security personnel. Under the direct supervision and education of the masses, the old public security personnel overcame the bureaucratic habits of the "small yamen," further changed the thinking and style of oppressing the people, gradually established the work style of people's police who honestly serve the people, and their work enthusiasm was greatly improved. For example, some police officers immediately reminded citizens to close their doors when they saw them left open at night. When handling household registration procedures, they did not ask citizens to wait at the police station as in the past, but the household registration clerk personally delivered them. Some police stations also put forward the slogan of striving to be model public security workers. According to the experience gained, to hold good citizen assemblies, the public security organs must carry out full preparatory work. First, it is necessary to break the ideological concerns of the staff and make them realize that this is an important method to contact the masses and improve work. Before the meeting, a symposium with representatives of mass organizations and activists should be held to mobilize them to carry out in-depth publicity and deliberation work among the masses. At the same time, the police station should strive to improve its work and have actual changes, so that the masses will dare to criticize and make suggestions at the meeting. The content of the report to the masses at the meeting should be simple and concise. When holding the first assembly, the emphasis should first be on explaining the nature of the police station, explaining that the public security personnel are the people's guards, and that there is an essential difference from the police organs of the reactionary ruling class. Secondly, report on household management, fire prevention, anti-theft work, the number of solved cases, the number of lost property returned to the owners, review the advantages and disadvantages in the work, commend good public security personnel, criticize bad public security personnel, and propose specific methods on how to improve the work in the future. Thirdly, commend examples and figures in the masses who abide by the law and assist in maintaining public order, and criticize lawbreakers. Those who lead the meeting should also promptly enlighten the masses to speak, and their attitude should be extremely modest and sincere. The report must be written well and reviewed by the City Public Security Bureau. The meeting time should not be too long to avoid affecting the work of the citizens.

　　定期召开辖区市民大会  报告工作征询改进意见
    安东市公安局依靠群众改进工作
    开好市民大会的三点经验
    【新华社安东十二日电】安东市人民政府公安局以派出所为单位，定期召开辖区市民大会，向市民报告工作，征询改进工作的意见，对加强公安工作和改造旧警察获得了显著的成绩。该市自去年六月取消区街政府组织加强公安派出所以后，因当时工作方法未能适应新的组织情况及时予以转变，加以一部分旧公安工作人员还残存着压迫人民的思想和作风，因此公安派出所发生了严重的脱离群众的现象。市公安局根据这些情况，除对全体公安人员进行思想教育外，并从九月份起，采取定期召开全体公安工作人员大会，表扬密切联系群众、关心人民利益的模范工作者，批评违犯纪律的工作人员，因而使公安人员的作风逐渐转变，市民群众对公安人员的认识亦初步好转。在这样的基础上，全市各公安派出所又普遍在去年十一月间，先后召开了各辖区的市民大会。会上，首先由派出所负责人员报告和检讨工作，并分别表扬了公安人员在执行政府法令中的模范事迹及批评了某些公安人员犯纪律的事例，继向市民群众恳切征询改进公安工作的意见。由于派出所负责人的态度切实诚恳，大大地提高了群众的积极性。据二十五个派出所统计，在这些会上共收到市民对公安机关、市政府及其他机关、工厂、合作社等的意见和建议达五百九十三件，其中批评和纠正旧警察作风的一百二十一条，对派出所工作提出意见的七十条。各辖区自这次大会后，一般市民转变了他们对旧警察传统的畏惧和不信任的心理，对人民公安工作有了正确的认识，因而自动地监督公安人员。旧公安人员在群众直接监督与教育下，克服了“小衙门”的官僚习气，进一步改变了压迫人民的思想作风，逐渐树立了老老实实为人民服务的人民警察作风，工作积极性也大为提高。如有的警察在晚上看见市民的大门未关，立即提醒关好。在办理登记户口手续时，不像过去要市民在派出所等候，而由户籍员亲自送去。有的派出所并提出争取做模范公安工作者的口号。根据获得的经验，要开好市民大会，公安机关必须进行充分的准备工作。首先要打破工作人员思想顾虑使其认识这是联系群众，提高工作的重要方法。在开会前要举行一次有群众团体代表和积极分子参加的座谈会，发动他们在群众中深入展开宣传和酝酿工作。同时，派出所要努力改善工作，并有实际的转变，这样，会议上群众才会勇于批评和提意见。开会时向群众所作的报告内容要通俗扼要。在举行第一次大会时，首先要着重解释派出所的性质，说明公安人员是人民的警卫员，与反动统治阶级的警察机关有本质的区别。其次报告户口管理、防火、防匪盗的工作，破案数目，返还案主失去的财物数目，检讨工作中的优缺点，表扬好的公安人员，批评坏的公安人员，以及提出今后如何改进工作的具体办法等。第三，表扬群众中守法和协助治安工作的范例、人物，批评违法分子。领导开会者并要及时启发群众发言，态度应极虚心、诚恳。报告须写好，并经市公安局审查。开会时间不可拖得太长，以免影响市民群众的工作。
