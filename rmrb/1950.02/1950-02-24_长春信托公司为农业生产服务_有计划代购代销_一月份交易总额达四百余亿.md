Changchun Trust Company Serves Agricultural Production with Planned Purchasing and Sales
January Transaction Volume Reaches Over 40 Billion

[Our Newspaper] Since implementing its work plan for serving agricultural production this year, the Changchun Trust Company's transaction volume in January reached over 41.8 billion Northeast currency. Of this, purchasing and sales on behalf of others accounted for 53.7 percent, with the ratio of transactions with rural areas outside the city to those within the city being 8 to 7.

In January, the company purchased over 600,000 catties of grain for the Yanji Supply and Marketing Cooperative, Suizhong Kaoshan, Yangbao, Beizhen and other cooperatives; purchased over 1.5 million catties of soybeans, sorghum, corn, etc., for the Grain Company; and established close purchasing relationships with Andong Xinghua Industrial Company, Gaiping County United Cooperative, Dehui Grain Company, and Hailin Enterprise Company. In terms of sales on behalf of others: in addition to selling a large quantity of backlogged goods for the city's department store, it also sold 27 cases of glass for the Qinhuangdao State-owned Yaohua Factory, 88 packages of dried shrimp for the Liaoxi Aquatic Products Company, four train cars of charcoal for the Liaoxi Provincial Cooperative, and large quantities of flour and white sugar from the Songjiang Enterprise Company and Yushu Flour Mill. The Trust Company also went to Tianjin to promote the sale of granulated sugar, exchanging it for over 30 kinds of New Year goods and daily necessities for citizens; it went to Xiongyue and other places south of Shenyang to promote the sale of miscellaneous grains, exchanging them for peanuts and small dried shrimp; it purchased rice, yellow tobacco, and dried mushrooms in the Shushi River area; and exchanged *wula* shoes for a large number of baskets in the Jiutai area.

In addition, in January, the Trust Company also sent personnel to Changchun, Jiutai, Yongji, Yitong and other counties to investigate rural economic development and sideline production. It helped the united cooperatives of Changling, Nong'an, Qianguo and other counties to sign contracts with private industries in Changchun. Contracts have now been signed for 2,000 two-foot hooks and 1,700 square-headed iron shovels for rural use. The company also signed a package sales contract with the Gonghe Hoe Blade Furnace, and provided the furnace with an interest-free loan of 100 million yuan for four months, planning to sell the furnace's products to farmers in nearby counties at a price 10 percent lower than the market price.

The Trust Company's planned approach of promoting finished products and purchasing raw materials by signing contracts with various purchasing and sales networks and public and private enterprises and cooperatives, selling local products for farmers, and exchanging them for necessities, not only plays a significant role in promoting the exchange of goods between urban and rural areas, but also supports the production of public and private industry and agriculture.

　　长春信托公司为农业生产服务　有计划代购代销
    一月份交易总额达四百余亿
    【本报讯】长春市信托公司，自实行本年业务为农业生产服务的工作计划以来，一月份交易总额达四百一十八亿余元东北币。其中代购代销即占百分之五三．七，对外埠农村的交易和对本市的交易为八与七之比。
    一月中，该公司为延吉供销总社、绥中靠山、杨保、北镇等合作社代购粮谷六十余万斤；代粮食公司收购大豆、高粱、苞米等百五十余万斤；并与安东兴华实业公司、盖平县联社、德惠粮食公司、海林企业公司建立了密切代购关系。在代销方面：除曾给本市百货公司代销大量积压商品外；并为秦皇岛国营耀华工厂代销玻璃二十七箱，辽西水产公司海米八八包、辽西省合作总社木炭四火车，以及松江企业公司、榆树火磨的大批面粉与白糖。信托公司又曾往天津推销砂糖，换回年货及市民生活日用品三十余种；去沈南线熊岳等地推销杂粮，换回花生、小海米等；在沭石河一带采购了大米、黄烟、元蘑；又以靰鞡在九台地区换回大批筐篓。
    此外，信托公司于一月中又曾派员去长春、九台、永吉、伊通等县调查农村经济发展及副业生产情况。帮助长岭、农安、前郭县等县联社与长春市私营工业订立合同。现已订农村用二尺钩子二千把、方头铁锹千七百把。该公司又与公和锄板炉订立包销合同，并以一亿元现款无利贷与该炉四个月，拟将该炉产品以低于市价百分之十的价格，卖给附近各县农民。
    信托公司这种有计划地通过各地购销网，和各公私营企业、合作社订立合同推销成品，采购原料，为农民推销土产品，换回必需品，不但是在促进城乡物资交流上起了极大作用，同时也扶助了公私营工农业的生产。
