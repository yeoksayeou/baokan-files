Employees of public and private factories throughout the city have successively organized themselves to intensify air defense. Factories have established patrol teams and other protection organizations, guarding the factories in shifts day and night, and using power outage time to participate in voluntary labor, sewing sacks, and installing sandbags to protect machines. Schools, agencies, and organizations have also been mobilized. Universities such as Jiaotong, Fudan, and Tongji, Shanghai Business College, and middle schools such as Mailun and Jingye have successively established fire prevention, rescue, disciplinary, propaganda, and liaison air defense organizations, and held anti-bombing seminars, actively cooperating in purchasing public bonds and launching anti-bombing propaganda.
