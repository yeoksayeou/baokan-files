Beijing Spring Festival Science Exhibition Extended by Two Days

[This Newspaper's Report] The Beijing Spring Festival Science Knowledge Exhibition has been deeply welcomed by the masses since its opening, with many farmers coming from the suburbs to visit. Every day there are many spectators outside the venue who cannot enter. The exhibition was originally scheduled to close on the 26th, but due to many spectators requesting an extension, the Standing Committee of the Preparatory Committee held a meeting yesterday (24th) afternoon and decided to extend the exhibition period by two days.

Furthermore, yesterday (24th), a total of 8,227 people visited the exhibition. Group visits were made by thirteen units including the General Office of the Central People's Government, the Reception Department of the Beijing Municipal People's Government, Huiwen Middle School, Mu Zhen Girls' Middle School, and a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army. The news photography team of the Beijing Film Studio continued to film the "From Ape to Man" section of the exhibition into a news documentary short film yesterday morning.

　　市京春节科展延期两日
    【本报讯】北京市春节科学知识展览会自开幕以来，深受群众欢迎，许多农民从四郊赶来参观。会场外每天都有很多观众不能入场。该会原定二十六日闭幕，现因很多观众要求延期，筹备会常委会特于昨（二十四）日下午开会决定延长展览期两日。
    又：昨（二十四）日参观该会者共八千二百二十七人，集体前往参观者有中央人民政府办公厅、北京市人民政府交际处、汇文中学、慕贞女中及解放军某部等十三个单位。北京电影制片厂新闻摄影队于昨日上午续将该会“从猿到人”部分拍制成新闻纪录短片。
