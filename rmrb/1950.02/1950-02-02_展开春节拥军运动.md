　　The Spring Festival is approaching, and people across the country are enthusiastically preparing to welcome the first Spring Festival since the founding of the People's Republic of China. This year's Spring Festival is worth celebrating enthusiastically because the Chinese People's Liberation Army has liberated all of mainland China except Tibet, and the liberation of Tibet, Taiwan, and Hainan Island is only a matter of time. Therefore, when celebrating this year's Spring Festival, we must first thank and comfort the heroic People's Liberation Army, and we should extend condolences to the families of revolutionary martyrs and revolutionary soldiers.
    Local people's governments and people's organizations should lead the people in voluntarily comforting the People's Liberation Army troops in various places, and universally organize military-civilian celebrations. At the celebrations, in addition to sufficient entertainment activities, the military and civilians should review the shortcomings in the past military-civilian relationship and engage in self-criticism so as to make the future relationship between the two sides closer. For the families of revolutionary martyrs and revolutionary soldiers, village governments in various regions should lead the people to carry out various preferential and condolence work, and at the same time conduct a careful inspection of the past work of giving preferential treatment to the families of martyrs and soldiers, in order to summarize experience and overcome shortcomings. In the new areas, people's governments and people's organizations should advocate the work of supporting the army and giving preferential treatment to the families of martyrs and soldiers.
    However, in this year's Spring Festival support-the-army work, attention should be paid to the serious disaster situation in many places, and attention should be paid to the people's ability to bear burdens. Therefore, for the troops, we should focus on expressing the people's enthusiasm for supporting and loving them; for the families of martyrs and soldiers, we should focus on determining ways to solve their actual difficulties. Except for those with very difficult lives, for general martyr and soldier families, we should not focus on material condolences, and necessary material condolences must prevent possible waste. Last year, some rural areas in North China launched a comfort bag campaign during the Spring Festival support-the-army movement. As a result, not only was a great deal of transportation capacity wasted due to the centralized comfort bags, but also many of the food items in the comfort bags rotted or were gnawed by mice. This experience should be noted by all regions.
    The work of giving preferential treatment to martyr and soldier families exists with different conditions and tasks in different regions. In the old and semi-old areas, the first thing to do is to check and arrange for substitute farming. Now that war service in various rear areas has completely stopped or been greatly reduced, this is a very favorable condition for substitute farming. Last year, various places promoted the fixed-responsibility substitute farming system (also known as the contracted farming system), which has already achieved good results. In the future, we should further combine substitute farming with mutual aid in production. In disaster areas, attention should be paid to organizing martyr and soldier families and retired revolutionary disabled soldiers to participate in sideline production; and the masses should be called upon to focus on helping poor and labor-lacking martyr and soldier families with the spirit of mutual assistance and mutual relief. When the government distributes relief grain, it should also give priority to them. The substitute farming work in the disaster areas should still be strengthened, but because the masses in the disaster areas are generally also in difficulty, the scope of substitute farming in the disaster areas should be appropriately reduced. In the new areas, the first thing to do is to improve the social status of martyr and soldier families and cultivate the masses' habit of respecting and caring for martyr and soldier families, so as to start organizing substitute farming based on the local situation and with reference to the old area's substitute farming methods. In cities, attention should be paid to introducing occupations to martyr and soldier families and retired revolutionary disabled soldiers, and organizing them to produce in cooperative ways. Those who are truly poor should be given necessary relief.
    All martyr and soldier families should raise their awareness during the Spring Festival support-the-army movement. It is extraordinarily glorious for one's children or husbands to participate in the People's Liberation Army for the cause of the people's liberation and to fight heroically against the enemy. We should carry forward this glory. If our children and husbands make meritorious contributions on the front lines, we should be models in the rear. If we have difficulties, the government and the masses have already been and are trying to help us. However, we cannot therefore develop a purely dependent viewpoint. We should produce well in the rear to reduce the burden on the people. We should be concerned about the consolidation of our army and continue to encourage our children and husbands to strive to carry the revolution through to the end and build a strong national defense force.

### 展开春节拥军运动

　　展开春节拥军运动
    春节快到了，全国人民正在热烈准备迎接中华人民共和国成立以后的第一个春节。今年的春节是值得热烈庆祝的，因为中国人民解放军已经解放了西藏以外的全中国大陆，而西藏和台湾、海南岛的解放，也只是时间问题了。因此，在庆祝今年的春节时，我们要首先感谢和慰劳英勇奋战的人民解放军，应当慰问革命烈士和革命军人的家属。
    各地人民政府和人民团体，对于各地的人民解放军部队，应当领导人民在自愿的条件下进行慰劳，并且普遍地组织军民联欢。在联欢会上，除应有充分的娱乐活动外，军民双方应当检讨过去军民关系中的缺点，进行自我批评，以便使今后的双方关系更加亲密。对于革命烈士家属和革命军人家属，各地区村政府应当领导人民进行各种优待和慰问工作，同时对过去的优待烈属军属的工作进行认真的检查，以求总结经验，克服缺点。在新区，人民政府和人民团体，应该对拥军工作和优待烈属、军属的工作加以倡导。
    但是，在今年的春节拥军工作中，应该注意到许多地方的严重灾情，应该注意到人民的负担能力。因此，对部队我们要着重表现人民对他们拥护爱戴的热忱，对烈士家属和军人家属要着重定出解决他们的实际困难的办法。除生活十分困难者外，对一般烈属、军属不能着重物质慰劳，而必要的物质慰劳也必须防止可能的浪费。去年华北某些农村，曾在春节劳军运动中发动慰劳袋运动，结果不但因集中慰劳袋而浪费了很大的运输力，而且慰劳袋内的食品，也有不少腐烂了，或者被老鼠咬了。这种经验，应为各地所注意。
    对烈属、军属的优待工作，在不同的地区存在着不同的条件和任务。在老区与半老区，首先要检查和布置代耕。现在后方各地战争勤务已经完全停止或大大减少，这对于代耕工作是一个极有利的条件。去年，各地推行了固定专责的代耕制（或称包耕制），已经有了很好成绩，今后应该进一步使代耕与生产互助结合起来。在灾荒地区，应该注意组织烈属、军属和退伍的革命残废军人，参加副业生产；并号召群众以互助互济的精神，着重帮助贫苦而无劳力的烈属、军属。政府发放救济粮时，也应首先照顾到他们。灾区的代耕工作仍应加强，但因为灾区群众一般也在困难之中，故应适当地缩小灾区的代耕面。在新区，首先应提高烈属、军属的社会地位，养成群众对烈属、军属尊敬和关心的习惯，以便根据当地情况，参照老区代耕办法，着手组织代耕。在城市，应注重为烈属、军属和退伍的革命残废军人介绍职业，以合作社方式组织他们生产。确实贫苦者，应给以必要的救济。
    一切烈属、军属，在春节拥军运动中都应当提高自己的觉悟。自己的子弟或丈夫为了人民解放事业而参加人民解放军，对敌人进行英勇战斗，这是异常光荣的。我们应该把这种光荣，发扬起来。我们的子弟、丈夫在前方立功，我们就应该在后方做模范。我们有困难，政府和群众已经而且正在设法帮助我们。但是，我们不能因此就产生单纯依赖的观点，我们应该在后方好好生产，以减轻人民负担。我们应该关心自己的军队的巩固，继续鼓励自己的子弟、丈夫为将革命进行到底与建设强大的国防军而奋斗。
