Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, February 4th. The Preparatory Committee of the Guangzhou Federation of Trade Unions issued a statement on the 3rd entitled "Our Protest," protesting the massive bloodshed caused by the British Hong Kong government's slaughter of Hong Kong tram workers. The full text of the statement is as follows:

　　On the evening of January 30, 38 organizations in Hong Kong and Kowloon jointly held a conference at the Tram Workers' Union to express sympathy to the oppressed tram workers. The British Hong Kong government dispatched armed police and troops, using assault vehicles, machine guns, submachine guns, and rattan shields, shooting and beating workers, resulting in more than 30 seriously injured and about 70 or 80 slightly injured (not counting injured passersby).

　　After shamefully creating this bloodshed, the British Hong Kong government closed the Tram Workers' Union on the morning of the 31st and arrested many union leaders. This brutal and barbaric act shows that the British Hong Kong government is intensifying its deprivation and persecution of the freedom and right to live of Chinese workers and Chinese compatriots.

　　Hong Kong's prosperity was created and restored by the blood and sweat of Chinese workers; Hong Kong's city traffic has been maintained for a long time by the cheap labor of tram workers. However, when Hong Kong tram workers proposed reasonable and just demands for increased allowances to compensate for actual wage losses and opposed the capitalists' oppression of closing factories due to rising prices, the British Hong Kong government consistently adopted an attitude of favoring British capitalists and ignored the suffering of workers. On the one hand, they supported the capitalists in implementing conspiracies such as stopping trams, attempting to subdue workers through starvation; on the other hand, they attempted to suppress workers through terror. We, all the workers, express our utmost indignation at this unreasonable and shameful action of the British Hong Kong government and lodge a serious protest against the British Hong Kong government for dispatching troops and police to oppress and injure Chinese workers and compatriots. Britain is promoting the recognition of the People's Republic of China and wants to establish diplomatic relations with the new China, but now the British Hong Kong government's military and police personnel dare to commit this atrocity of oppressing the Chinese people, which is intolerable to our patriotic Chinese people. We believe that the British Hong Kong government should:

　　First, immediately punish the murderers and guarantee that similar incidents will not happen again in the future.

　　Second, immediately release the arrested workers and union leaders and unseal the Tram Workers' Union.

　　Third, compensate for all losses and treat the injured workers.

　　Fourth, taking into account social order, immediately order the capitalists to restore traffic.

　　广州总工会筹委会发表声明
    抗议香港英政府暴行
    【新华社广州四日电】广州市总工会筹委会三日发表题为《我们的抗议》的声明，抗议香港英国政府屠杀香港电车工人的巨大流血惨案。声明全文如下：
    一月三十日晚上，港九三十八个社团联合在电车工会举行慰问被压迫的电车工友大会，香港英国政府竟派出武装警察、军队，使用冲锋车、机枪、冲锋枪、藤牌，枪击、棒打工人，致重伤者三十余人，轻伤者约七八十人（过路市民受伤者未计在内）。
    香港英国政府可耻地制造这一次流血惨案后，复于三十一日晨封闭电车工会，逮捕工会领袖多人。这种残暴野蛮的行为，表示了香港英国政府对待中国工人和中国同胞的自由生存权利剥夺迫害的变本加厉。
    凭了中国工人的血汗，创造和恢复了香港的繁荣；凭了电车工人的廉价劳动，长期维持着香港的市面交通。但香港电车工人此次因物价上涨，提出增加津贴、补偿实际工资的损失、反对资方关厂压迫的合理的正义的要求时，香港英国政府却一贯采取偏袒英籍资方的态度，置工人生活痛苦于不顾。一方面支持资方实行停车等阴谋手段，企图以饥饿屈服工人；一方面却企图以恐怖镇压工人。对于香港英国政府这种无理的可耻的举动，我们全体工人表示万分的愤慨，向出动军警压迫伤害中国工人和同胞的香港英国政府提出严重的抗议。英国正在宣传承认中华人民共和国，要和新中国建立邦交，而今香港英国政府军警人员竟然敢于做出这次压迫中国人民的暴行，这是我们爱国的中国人民所不能忍受的。我们认为香港英国政府应该：
    第一，立即惩罚凶手及保证今后不再有同样事件发生。
    第二，立即释放被捕工人及工会领袖，启封电车工会。
    第三，赔偿一切损失及医治受伤工人。
    第四，顾全社会秩序，即令资方恢复交通。
                广州市总工会筹委会
            二月三日
