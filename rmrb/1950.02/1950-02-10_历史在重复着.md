　　"History is Repeating Itself"
    The U.S. executive body in Bonn, the so-called West German Federal Government's Minister of Justice Dehler, openly declared that those Nazi war criminals serving sentences in Landsberg Prison should be amnestied and released. He stated that the Bonn government has great doubts about the fairness of certain judgments.

    Undoubtedly, Dehler's voice is the voice of his American master. In order to turn West Germany into a fascist stronghold, they very much need the help of Nazi elements. Many notorious butchers have already been freed. In the near future, the gates of Landsberg Prison will be wide open to those who have not yet reached a compromise with the American-Bonn "god of justice."

    Hitler's Bonn successors recently celebrated an "anniversary": it was twenty-five years ago, in December 1924, that Hitler left Landsberg Prison before serving even six months of his five-year sentence, a sentence he received for organizing the fascist coup of November 9, 1923. It was in the comfortable rooms of this Landsberg fortress that Hitler and Hess wrote "Mein Kampf." At that time, Germany's monopoly capitalists pardoned this fascist villain and instructed him to carry out the sinister plan written in this fascist bible.

    Now America's monopoly capitalists plan to release Hitler's guilty accomplices from the same prison. It is very clear that Wall Street is placing great hope in them.

　　“历史在重复着”
    美国在波恩的执行机关，所谓西德联邦政府的司法部长德莱公开宣称，那些正在兰斯堡监狱里服刑的纳粹战犯应该被大赦和释放。他声明波恩政府对于某些判决的是否公正，抱有很大的怀疑。
    毫无疑问，德莱的声音就是他美国主子的声音。为了把西德变成一个法西斯蒂的大本营，他们是很需要纳粹分子的帮助的。许多声名狼藉的屠夫已经获得了自由。在不久的将来，兰斯堡监狱的大门对于那些还没有和美国——波恩的“正义之神”取得妥协的人们是大开着的。
    希特勒的波恩继承者最近正在庆祝一个“纪念日”：那是二十五年之前，一九二四年的十二月，希特勒在他的五年徒刑没有服满六个月之前离开了兰斯堡监狱，这个徒刑是因为他组织了一九二三年十一月九日的法西斯政变而被判决的。正是在这个兰斯堡堡垒舒适的房间里，希特勒和赫斯写了《我的奋斗》，德国的垄断资本家在那个时候赦免了这个法西斯恶汉并且指示他去进行写明在这本法西斯圣经上的凶恶的计划。
    现在美国的独占资本家们打算从这同一个监牢里释放有罪的希特勒的同犯们。非常明显，华尔街是把很大的希望寄托在他们身上的。
