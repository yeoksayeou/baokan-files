Comrade Soviet Journalist, speaking in a frontline location about his experiences reporting with the army, shared some insights that are well worth considering for our Chinese journalists.

He said that these are almost universal experiences and general principles for Soviet journalists:

First, you must see everything with your own eyes.

Second, from soldiers to regimental commanders, everyone is a potential interview subject, but you should focus more on writing about the soldiers in the companies.

Third, if you want to write about a person, you must not only write about what they do, but also what they think, what they feel, what they talk about with their comrades, whether they smoke, whether they have blisters on their feet, etc. To truly understand a person, you must go deep into reality to experience life. If you want to write about a charge, you don't necessarily have to participate in it, but you must have the experience of a charge.

Fourth, as a journalist, you should write more about others and less about yourself. Don't write things like "I arrived there," "I saw this," "I heard that," etc. Once, a war correspondent for Red Star wrote about entering the village of Orel. The newspaper comrades called him in for a discussion and asked him, "Who else went in?" He said, "A battalion." They asked, "How many people?" He said, "Five hundred." Finally, the newspaper comrades told him, "You should write about those five hundred people."

Fifth, journalists must be good at sitting on a cold bench, sometimes writing for ten hours straight.

Sixth, before writing, a journalist must first have a political purpose, then collect various facts, and then select and discard them.

### 苏联记者某同志  谈随军采访经验

　　苏联记者某同志
    谈随军采访经验
    苏联记者某同志在前线某地谈到他的随军采访经验时，说了很值得我们中国新闻工作者参考的一席话。
    他说，这几乎是苏联记者大家的经验和一般的原则：
    第一，什么事情都要自己亲眼看到。
    第二，从士兵到团长，都是谈话的对象，但你应当更多到连队中去写士兵。
    第三，如果你想写一个人，不仅要写他做什么，还要写他想什么，感觉什么，与同志们谈些什么，抽烟没有，脚上起泡没有等等。要真正体会一个人，必须深入实际去体会生活。假如你想写一次冲锋，虽不一定要参加这次冲锋，但必须有过冲锋的经验。
    第四，作为一个记者，应该多写别人，少写自己。不要在文章中写我到了那里，我看见了什么，我又听见了什么等等。有一次红星报的一位随军记者写他进了奥勒尔村。报社同志找他去谈话，问他：“还有谁进去了？”他说：“还有一个营。”问：“有多少人？”他说：“五百人。”最后报社同志告诉他说：“你应当去写那五百人。”
    第五，记者要善于坐冷板凳，有时一坐下就要写上十个钟头。
    第六，记者在写作之前，先要有一个政治目的，然后收集各种事实，再加取舍。
