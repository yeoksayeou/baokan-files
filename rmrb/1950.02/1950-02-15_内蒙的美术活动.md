　　Art Activities in Inner Mongolia
    Yin Shoushi

    The people of Inner Mongolia were first exposed to new art during the Anti-Japanese War, after Comrades Chen Shuliang, Jiao Xinhe, and Zhu Dan began working in the Sanbian Inner Mongolia area. They reflected many aspects of the lives of the Mongolian people, and still leave a deep impression on the people of Inner Mongolia.

    After Inner Mongolia was liberated on "August 15th," a group of young Inner Mongolian art enthusiasts enthusiastically participated in Inner Mongolian cultural work. A few young comrades interested in art began to study painting. In July 1946, when the Inner Mongolia Cultural Troupe went to the grasslands for a tour, they organized a group of young people to be specifically responsible for exhibiting woodcuts, New Year pictures, and current affairs photographs from the liberated areas. At the same time, they familiarized themselves with life on the grasslands and began to draw quick sketches and studies. In the winter of 1946, we had already passed through Chahar and Xilingol, and arrived at Linxi in Zhaowuda League. It was during the severe cold season on the Mongolian grasslands, and all activities were impossible. Everyone sat around the kang (heated brick bed) and began two months of relatively formal professional study, gaining a preliminary understanding of art.

    In May 1947, the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Government was established. After the land reform movement, the rule of feudal princes and the oppression of the Kuomintang were crushed. The broad masses of Inner Mongolian farmers and herdsmen were emancipated and received land. Therefore, there was a pressing need for culture. "Inner Mongolia Pictorial" was launched under these circumstances.

    "Inner Mongolia Pictorial" was founded in April 1948. Under the direct leadership of the Inner Mongolia Party Committee, it followed the literary and artistic line of Chairman Mao's "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art." Through popular art forms, it publicized the Party's various policies, cooperated with specific political tasks, promoted rural production, supported the front lines, comforted the army, and gave preferential treatment to military families. It also promptly introduced production experience and common sense of epidemic prevention and hygiene, in order to meet the needs of the broad masses of farmers and herdsmen. When we first started preparing for publication, there were very few working comrades. To run a good popular pictorial, we lacked both experience and ability, and the printing conditions at the time were also insufficient. Most of the working comrades were new to this kind of work and were very enthusiastic, but enthusiasm alone could not solve the problem. Therefore, we worked and studied constantly, gradually exploring and researching. After the pictorial was published, it was welcomed by the masses, which strengthened our confidence in our work.

    Because the pictorial implemented the Party's policies and cooperated with the specific work at each stage, it played its due role among the broad masses of farmers and herdsmen. When the pictorial was distributed to the rural grasslands, it was welcomed by the masses. Especially the herdsmen on the grasslands, after getting a pictorial, even if the pictorial depicted life in agricultural areas, they would happily post it up. For example, in a small village called Beishantun, there were only seven households in total, and six of them subscribed to the pictorial. In addition, the serial cartoons "Bao Yintu's Great Transformation" and "Marriage Should Be Independent," which we drew based on the current problems of transforming idlers and the unreasonable marriage system in rural areas, also played a role in the countryside.

    In addition to the pictorial, we printed some New Year pictures. Due to the closed transportation in the Inner Mongolia area, regular pictorials were quite difficult to distribute to the scattered nomadic areas. Therefore, we used the form of New Year pictures to carry out propaganda to the grasslands. Most of the six New Year pictures issued last year were on the themes of nomadic areas. Sometimes, we used the grassland temple fairs to draw many serial cartoons related to livestock breeding, physiology, and hygiene for propaganda and education.

    "Inner Mongolia Pictorial" has now been published to the twenty-fifth issue, with a circulation of 3,000 to 3,500 copies per issue. In terms of New Year pictures, six types were printed last year, with a circulation of 45,000 copies; eleven types have been drawn this year. Recently, a "Collection of Inner Mongolia New Year Pictures" has also been published. These work achievements are insignificant, but the masses are very concerned about our work. Every time we go to the countryside for interviews, they ask when the pictorial will be printed and often provide many opinions and requests, hoping that the pictorial will tell them more about new production methods. They even meticulously point out when a certain action in the pictorial is drawn incorrectly or when a certain production tool is drawn wrong. From these facts, we feel even more strongly the importance of the pictorial work and should constantly demand how to improve and elevate our work so that the pictorial can truly play a guiding role among the masses.

    The new art in Inner Mongolia is only in its nascent stage. Our ability is very limited, and we have not been able to closely integrate it with the inherent cultural heritage of the Mongolian people to create new art with Mongolian national characteristics. We earnestly hope that comrades working in art will give us more help and guidance so that the new art movement can take root and grow in Inner Mongolia.

### 内蒙的美术活动

　　内蒙的美术活动
    尹瘦石
    内蒙古人民接触新美术是在抗日战争期间，由陈叔亮、焦心河、朱丹诸同志到三边内蒙地区工作之后开始的。他们反映了许多蒙古人民的生活，至今给内蒙人民还留下深刻的印象。
    “八一五”内蒙解放后，一批爱好文艺的内蒙青年，热情的参加了内蒙文艺工作。少数爱好美术的青年同志，开始学习绘画。一九四六年七月，内蒙文工团往草地作巡回公演，就组织了一部分青年，专门负责展览解放区的木刻、年画及时事照片，同时使他们熟悉草地生活，开始画速写素描。一九四六年冬，我们已经走过了察哈尔、锡林格勒、抵达昭乌达盟的林束，那时正值蒙古草地严寒的季节，一切活动无法进行，大家围坐在炕上，开始了二个月比较正规的业务学习，对美术有了初步的认识。
    一九四七年五月，内蒙人民自治政府成立，经过了土地改革运动，打垮了封建王公统治，和国民党的压迫。内蒙广大农牧民翻了身，分得了土地，因此在文化的要求很迫切。《内蒙画报》即在这种情况下创刊了。
    《内蒙画报》创刊于一九四八年四月，在内蒙党委直接领导下，根据了毛主席在“延安文艺座谈会上的讲话”的文艺方针，通过了通俗的艺术形式，宣传党的各种政策，配合具体的政治任务，推动农村生产、支援前线、慰劳军队、优待军属，并及时地介绍生产经验，防疫卫生等常识，以求得适合于广大农牧民的要求。当刚开始筹备出版的时候，工作同志很少，要办好一个通俗的画报，无论在经验上，能力上，及当时的印刷条件上，都是很不够的。工作同志大都是新近参加这种工作，热情很高，但只凭热情解决不了问题，于是我们一面工作，一面不断学习，逐渐摸索研究，在画报出版后，受到了群众的欢迎，也就增强了我们工作的信心。
    由于画报执行了党的政策，配合了每个阶段的具体工作，因此，它在广大的农牧民中起了它应有的作用。当画报发行到农村草地，是受到群众欢迎的，尤其是草地的牧民们，得到一张画报之后，即使画报上所画的是农业地区的生活，他们也欢喜地张贴起来。如有一个叫北山屯的小村子，一共只有七家人家，而有六家订阅了画报。此外，我们根据农村中当前存在的改造二流子及不合理的婚姻制度问题所画的“宝音图大改造”及“婚姻应自主”等连环画，在农村中也曾起了一些作用。
    除了画报以外，我们印了一些新年画。由于内蒙地区交通的闭塞，定期画报对于分散的游牧地区的牧民，发行上感到相当困难，因此我们利用年画的形式向草地进行宣传。去年所出的六种新年画，其中大部分为游牧区的题材，有时利用草地的庙会，画了许多有关繁殖牲畜、生理卫生等连环画进行宣传教育。
    《内蒙画报》现在已出版到二十五期，每期发行的份数为三千份至三千五百份。新年画方面，去年印了六种，发行了四万五千份；今年已画好了十一种。最近，又出版了一本《内蒙年画集》。这些工作成绩是微不足道的，但群众对我们的工作却非常关切，当我们每次下乡采访的时候，都探问画报什么时候可以印出来，并经常提供了许多意见和要求，希望画报更多告诉他们一些新的生产方法，甚至于画报上某一点动作画得不对，或是某一件生产工具画错了，他们都很细致地提出来。从这些事实中，更使我们感到画报工作责任的重大，应该时刻的要求我们在工作上怎样改进和提高，才能使画报在群众中真正起指导的作用。
    新的美术在内蒙仅是开弱的阶段，我们的能力很薄拓，还没有能够和蒙古民族固有的文化遗产相紧密的结合起来，创造出蒙古民族风格的新美术。我们恳切地希望美术工作的同志们给我们更多的帮助与指导，使新美术运动在内蒙生根长大起来。
