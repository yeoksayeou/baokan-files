And to use all their strength and every opportunity to publicize this great significance. It also requires that, under these new and favorable conditions, patriotic theater workers should be more determined to rise up and strive to eliminate the remaining bandits, complete land reform, vigorously carry out economic and cultural construction, overcome disasters and difficulties, and improve the people's lives through the transformation and unity of theater workers themselves, through the high degree of unity between the ideological content of the script and its artistic form, through the correct orientation for workers, peasants, and soldiers, and through the widespread and in-depth development of the theater movement. In daily work, it is especially necessary to clear up the remaining influence of rumors and slanders about Sino-Soviet relations left by the American imperialists and the remaining bandits, consolidate and develop the friendship between the Chinese and Soviet people, enliven artistic and cultural exchanges between the two countries, deepen the understanding and study of Soviet culture, especially theatrical art, eliminate the remaining illusions about imperialist and capitalist countries, and some unhealthy emotions and prejudices and preferences infected by American movies in the past.
