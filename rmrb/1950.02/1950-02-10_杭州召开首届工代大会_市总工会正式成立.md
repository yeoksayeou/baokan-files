The congress discussed and approved important resolutions on "Summary of Trade Union Work in the Past Eight Months and Future Tasks", "Carrying Out Workers' Cooperative Work", and "Abolishing the Body Search System." Finally, the congress also rewarded 14 units and 127 heroes who had collectively rendered meritorious service in protecting factories before liberation and in the production and conservation campaign after liberation.
