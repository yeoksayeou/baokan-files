The Communist Party of Great Britain's Land Program in the Election
    By Dunman Translated by Jian Heng

    In the current disastrous state of land issues, and with the upcoming election, a great responsibility falls upon the shoulders of the Communist Party. Given the obvious unity among other parties, and their blatant tolerance of spending huge sums of money annually on food that could be produced on our own farms, it is we, and only we, who can propose a real countermeasure.

    In the policies of the Labor government, none is more reprehensible than its approach to domestic agriculture. Because that is a thoroughly class-based policy, designed to appease and please landlords and Conservative farmers, it has lamentably lost those opportunities that could have been used to greatly expand the production of bread grains, meat, sugar, vegetables, and feed.

    Contrary to the expectations of the millions of workers who voted for the Labor government in 1945, the government's record on land issues is no different from the Conservatives' approach under similar circumstances. While unprecedentedly huge sums of money are pouring into the pockets of employers in industry at high prices, in an attempt to stimulate increased production without success, the demands of farm workers for a living wage and the abolition of tenancy have been met with rejection, circumvention, and disillusionment.

    The program that our candidates will strive for is very different from the four-year plan announced by Williams in 1947. We will stand at the forefront to fight for the abolition of the so-called "return to animal husbandry" policy initiated by Hudson in 1944 and promoted by Williams. We do this not because we do not need a large expansion of animal products—milk, eggs, meat, bacon, etc.—but because, as we predicted in 1944, without a general expansion of cultivated land, increasing livestock products can only—and already has—lead to greater reliance on imported feed and a reduction in the acreage of land for growing bread grains. (Despite the targets set by Williams, wheat acreage has decreased by one million acres—more than 25 percent—since 1943.)

    Therefore, the difference between our program and the programs of other parties lies in its correct basis on the need to continue increasing cultivated land, and at a rate of one million to one and a half million acres per year, to reduce the eight or nine million acres of unproductive, undeveloped permanent grassland that still exists in England and Wales. If this can be accomplished, then there will be no difficulty in restoring wheat acreage to the level of three million acres or even increasing it beyond that number. The increased land will allow hundreds of thousands of acres to be planted with feed such as oats, alfalfa, kale, and grasses, which will enable us to properly increase the number of livestock.

    At the same time, cultivating the old, "permanent" grassland can utilize the best mixed-farming methods to plant grasses on land that has produced grains for a period. The fertility of this land can be restored, and it can produce more and better forage than "permanent" pastures. In addition, greatly increasing the use of silage and haymaking methods will be much more efficient than drying hay, and can also feed a greatly increased number of livestock with a reduced acreage of pasture land.

    But beyond the so-called farmland in this country, there are millions of acres of marginal land, including mountains, swamps, and deer forests, that urgently need development. The Labor government, bound by Conservative policies and unwilling to infringe on the vested interests of landlords, has rejected the massive development work needed by our economic situation. In Scotland alone, there are ten to twelve million acres of land that currently produce nothing but grouse and deer. However, as long as the land is nationalized and a long-term investment plan is adopted, it can quickly become land that produces large herds of cattle and sheep.

    But such a program requires genuine socialist steps. Its realization is impossible without conflict with rich peasants and landlords. High-price policies must be revised. The huge sums of money now indiscriminately poured into farmers' pockets (most of which are obtained by rich peasants) should be used to encourage cooperative farming programs among the millions of small farmers who are the backbone of agriculture. At present, a major portion of domestic grain production is produced by small farmers; but the Labor government treats them very badly. Because the amount of their individual produce sold is small, the high prices of agricultural products, although greatly increasing the income of rich peasants, do not solve the problems caused by their lack of capital equipment and raw materials.

    Secondly, such a program cannot be achieved without regulation and directives. The power that Williams abandoned due to the insistence of the "National Farmers' Union" should be restored, and the cultivation orders and directives to produce certain specific crops in the war years should also be re-adopted. Today, the general situation is that production is declining, agricultural standards are deteriorating, arable land is becoming increasingly barren, and grasslands are being neglected. At this time, the number of farmers listed as third parties under so-called supervision has been reduced to very few nationwide; this situation is clearly a scandal.

    Finally, there is the issue of labor on the land. Agricultural workers overwhelmingly voted for the Labor Party in 1945, making many rural seats in history for the first time, but no other industrial sector has treated agricultural workers worse. The government has broken every promise it made to abolish the very bad tenancy system. With prices so high, who can say that their current minimum wage of ninety-four shillings is not merely a subsistence wage? The government's refusal to abolish the employment contract control order indicates that it has recognized this. But today, the productivity of every worker in industry is higher than ever before, and the minimum wage should logically be much higher than the current level. Many branches of the "National Union of Agricultural Workers" are pressing their executive bodies to take action to support their demand for a minimum wage of six pounds per week, which will become the central plank of our party's rural campaign. This is not just a matter of fairness to agricultural workers. Without a real increase in farm wage levels, without a large housing program and the abolition of tenancy, agriculture will not be able to attract enough labor to do the necessary work.

    A new land reclamation movement and an increase in wheat acreage; land nationalization and full utilization of all the resources of the land; fair treatment for agricultural workers and small farmers—in summary, these are the current socialist programs we are fighting for.

    How to make this program pass? First, all branches of the Party must have a new understanding of the importance of these issues, because they not only affect the masses of people who consume food, but also, looking more broadly, they affect our struggle for independence from financial oligarchy.

    Second, branches and constituencies should consider the people in the countryside surrounding most town branches when planning their campaign movements.

    Finally, in each constituency, plans must be made to attract scattered comrades, sympathizers, and small rural groups to participate in activities, in order to promote the "Rural Banner" newspaper with an organized force. Judging from its influence in the areas where it is already sold, it can no longer be allowed to entrust the responsibility of selling the newspaper to a small number of comrades. This newspaper monthly leads the struggle of organized workers in the countryside. Making its sales in each county equal to the sales in counties such as Leicester, Kent, or Dorset will surely win new strength to act for our program, that is, to fully develop the land for the benefit of the people, and to lay a foundation for a new type of class struggle in the countryside.

### 英共在竞选中的土地政纲

　　英共在竞选中的土地政纲
    敦曼著  健恒译
    在目前土地问题的灾难性的情况下，与大选即将到来的时候，一个巨大的责任落到了共产党的肩上。鉴于其他政党间显明的团结一致，以及他们对本可以在我们自己农场上生产的食物每年却支出巨额金钱予以毫不在乎的容忍，因此将是我们（指英共——译注）的代表也仅有我们的代表才能提出一个真正的对策了。
    工党政府的各项政策上，再也没有比它对本国农业的方针更该谴责的了。因为那彻头彻尾地是阶级性的政策，是用以安抚同讨好地主同保守党的农民的，它就可悲地丧失了那些可能利用的存在着的机会，来大大地扩充制作面包的粮食、肉类、糖类、蔬菜与饲料的生产了。
    与一九四五年投工党政府选票的千百万工人的期望相反，政府在土地问题上的纪录，与保守党在同样环境下的作法，全然没有什么两样。正当史无前例的巨大款项以高价方式倾流给工业中的雇主阶级，企图以此刺激生产增加而毫无成就的时候，农场工人对足够生活的工资以及废除租佃制的要求，却遭逢到拒绝、规避及幻灭。
    我们的候选人所要争取的纲领，是与一九四七年威廉士所宣布的四年计划截然不同的。我们要站在最前列来争取废除一九四四年赫得逊所首倡、而为威廉士所发挥的所谓“回到畜牧”的政策。我们这样做并不因为我们不需要畜牧产品——牛乳、鸡蛋、肉类、咸肉等——的大加扩充，而是因为如我们在一九四四年所预示，没有普遍扩大耕地面积，增加牧畜产品只能使得——而且已经使得——更依靠舶来饲料的供给，以及种植制作面包的谷物的田亩之减缩。（尽管有威廉士所定的目标，一九四三年以来小麦耕地已减少了一百万英亩——即减少了百分之二十五以上。）
    所以，我们的纲领与其他政党纲领不同之处，就在于它正确地基于继续增加耕地的需要，并以每年一百万至一百五十万英亩的速率，来减缩仍旧存在于英格兰与威尔斯的一无生产未经开发的八百万或九百万英亩的永久草地。假若这个得以完成，那么，要使小麦田亩数回复到三百万英亩的水平或甚至使其增加到超过这个数字就没有什么困难了。增加的土地将使几十万英亩土地可种植如燕麦、紫苜蓿、甘蓝与草类等饲料，这样就可使我们能妥当地增殖牲口的数目了。
    同时，耕垦那古老的、“永久的”草地，可利用最好的混种法，来在生产过一个时期谷物的土地上种植草类。这种土地的肥沃就可恢复，也可生产比“永久”牧场更多和更好的草料。再加上大大增加用储藏草料和干晒之方法，会较制干草有效率得多，并且还可以以减少了亩数的牧草地，来饲养数目大大增加了的牲畜。
    但是在这个国度的所谓农地以外，还有着千百万英亩包括山林、泽地以及鹿林的边际土地，它们亟需开发。工党政府被保守党的政策所束缚，同时也不愿意侵犯地主既得的利益，就拒绝我们经济情势所需的巨大的开拓工作。仅在苏格兰一地，就有着一千至一千二百万英亩的土地，在目前除了松鸡与麋鹿之外，什么也不出产。然而，只要把土地国有化并采取一个长期的投资计划，它就可以很快地变成出产大群牛羊的土地了。
    但是这样一个纲领需要有真正的社会主义的步骤。它的实现不可能不与富农和地主冲突。高价政策必须修正。现在无区别地倒入农民钱袋的巨额款项（极大部分为富农所得），应当拿来在农业骨干的千万小农之间鼓励合作农业的计划之用。现在国内粮食生产，主要的一部分是由小农生产的；但工党政府对他们的待遇却极不好。由于他们个人的生产品售卖的数额很小，农产品价格高昂虽大大增加了富农的收入，却并没有解决他们因缺乏资本设备和原料等而引起的问题。
    其次，这样一个纲领没有管制与指令是不可能实现的。因“全国农会”的坚持而使威廉士放弃的权力，应该恢复，在战争岁月里那些耕作命令和生产某些特定农作物的指令，亦应当重新采用。今天一般的情况，是生产下降、农业标准恶化、可耕地日见荒芜，以及草地被忽视等，在这个时候，在所谓监督制之下的列入第三者的农民，其人数就全国而言，已减低到很少了；这种情况，显然是一丑闻。
    最后，还有土地上的劳动力问题。农业工人们在一九四五年占压倒多数投票支持工党，使得在历史上第一次有很多乡村议席，但是再也没有其他工业部门较农业工人所受待遇更坏的了。政府违背了它废除很坏的租佃制的每一诺言。物价这么高，有谁能够说他们目前九十四先令的最低工资，不是仅仅够维持生活的工资呢？政府拒绝取消雇佣定约管制令，表示它已认识到这点。但今天在工业中每一工人的生产力已较从前任何时候都高，最低工资照常理也该比目前水平高得多。“全国农业工人联合”的许多支部已在压迫它们的执行机构采取行动，支持它们每星期最低工资六镑的要求，这将成为我们党在乡村竞选中的中心主张。这不单只是一个对农业工人公平的问题。没有农场工资水平的真正增加，没有一个大的造屋计划和废除租佃制，农业就不可能吸引足够的劳动力来从事必需的工作。
    新的开荒运动及小麦田亩的增加；土地国有化及充分使用土地的全部资源；对农业工人以及小农的公平待遇——概括说来，这些就是我们所争取的当前的社会主义纲领。
    如何来使得这个纲领通过呢？第一，党的所有支部对这些有关问题的重要性要有一新的认识，因为它们不独影响消费食物的人民大众，而且眼光扩大来看，它们还影响到我们为脱离金元独裁而独立的斗争。
    第二，支部与选区筹划它们的竞选运动时，应当考虑到围绕着大多数城镇支部的那些乡村中的民众。
    最后，在每一选区，必须订下计划吸引分散的同志、同情者、小的乡村团体，参加活动，以一种有组织的力量来推销“乡村旗帜报”。就它在已销售地区的影响看来，若把推销报纸的责任付与少数同志，是不能再容许了。这报纸逐月领导着乡村有组织工人的斗争。使它在各郡的销售数都能与勒司特、肯德或多塞德等郡的销数相等，那一定会争取到新的力量为我们的纲领行动起来，即为着人民利益而充分开发土地，并为农村中的新型的阶级斗争奠立一个基础。
