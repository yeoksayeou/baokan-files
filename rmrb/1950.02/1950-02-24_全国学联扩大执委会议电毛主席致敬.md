　　All-China Students' Federation Expanded Executive Committee Meeting Sends Telegram of Respect to Chairman Mao
    [Beijing News] The Expanded Second Executive Committee Meeting of the Fourteenth All-China Students' Federation passed a telegram of respect to Chairman Mao. The text of the telegram is as follows: Chairman Mao of the Central People's Government:
    We, the entire executive committee members attending the Expanded Second Executive Committee Meeting of the Fourteenth All-China Students' Federation, hereby extend our highest respect to you.
    For many years, you have led the people of our country to overcome difficulties and defeat the reactionaries, enabling us to stand up and be masters of our own destiny. Recently, you completed another work of great historical significance for the Chinese people: the signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance, and Mutual Assistance, which consolidated the great unity of the 700 million people of China and the Soviet Union, provided a strong guarantee for world peace, and greatly assisted in the peaceful construction of New China.
    Since the 14th National Congress of Students convened last March, students across the country, united in the ranks of the All-China Students' Federation, have worked hard to support the People's Liberation War, support the People's Government, actively engaged in study, transformed their thinking, and unprecedentedly improved their level of awareness and organization. These achievements are inseparable from you and the Central People's Government and the Communist Party of China that you lead. In the future, we are determined to unite students across the country, strive to develop New Democratic study in preparation for participating in the construction of the motherland, assist the People's Government in rapidly liberating Tibet, Taiwan, and Hainan Island, and unite with international democratic youth and students to fight for the defense of lasting world peace. In all of the above work, we will certainly advance bravely under your education, along with the people of the whole country.

　　全国学联扩大执委会议电毛主席致敬
    【北京讯】中华全国学生联合会第十四届第二次执行委员会扩大会议通过向毛主席致敬电，电文如下：中央人民政府毛主席：
    我们，出席中华全国学生联合会第十四届第二次执行委员会的全体执行委员，谨向你致崇高的敬礼。
    这许多年来，你一直领导我们全国人民克服困难，战胜反动派，使我们翻身做了主人；最近你又一次为中国人民完成了一件具有极大历史意义的工作，订立了中苏友好同盟互助条约，巩固了中苏两国七万万人民的大团结，对世界和平作了有力的保证，并且大大地帮助了新中国的和平建设。
    从去年三月中华全国学生第十四届代表大会召开以来，全国学生团结在中华全国学生联合会的队伍中，努力支援人民解放战争，拥护人民政府，积极展开学习，改造思想，空前地提高了自己的觉悟程度和组织程度，这些成绩与你和你所领导的中央人民政府和中国共产党是完全分不开的。我们今后决心团结全国同学，为准备参加建设祖国而努力开展新民主主义学习，协助人民政府，迅速解放西藏、台湾、海南岛，并与国际民主青年、学生，团结一致，为保卫世界持久和平而斗争。在以上这些工作中，我们一定在你的教育下，和全国人民一道奋勇前进。
