　　On the Soviet Loan to China
　　Hu Hua
    According to the Sino-Soviet "Agreement on a Loan to the People's Republic of China," the Soviet Union will lend China 300 million US dollars over the five years from 1950 to 1954, to be used to pay for the machinery, equipment, and materials provided by the Soviet Union. The loan bears an annual interest rate of only one percent, and repayment will begin in 1954, to be paid off in ten years by 1963.
    The significance of the Soviet government's loan to China is, first of all, to help the Chinese people rapidly restore the people's economy, which has been damaged by prolonged war.
    As everyone knows, the Chinese people have been in a state of nationwide war for thirteen years. The anti-China war launched by Japanese imperialism starting in 1937 and the anti-people civil war launched by the Kuomintang reactionaries aided by US imperialism since Japan's surrender have forced the deeply afflicted Chinese people to engage in a long and arduous struggle for their liberation. The war has severely damaged the Chinese economy; coupled with the relentless destruction of the Chinese economy by the Chiang Kai-shek-led Four Families clique and foreign imperialists over the long period of twenty-seven years, China has fallen into a state of economic decline, and the victorious Chinese people cannot but face serious economic difficulties. The task before us is first and foremost to heal the war wounds and combat famine. Chairman Mao said that we are "in difficulty, have solutions, and have hope." This solution and hope lie in our efforts to increase income and reduce expenditure, rely on our own efforts, and in the Soviet Union extending a hand of warm assistance to the Chinese people—generously lending us huge sums of money. China is an economically backward agricultural country, and to heal the wounds of war and restore the damaged economy, what is urgently needed first is various industrial machinery and equipment. The Soviet loan is a solid help to us in this regard.
    The Soviet government's loan to China is also aimed at accelerating China's industrialization.
    As everyone knows, to make China a strong and prosperous country, the most important thing is to increase the proportion of industry in our people's economy and turn China into an industrialized country. The Soviet loan to China is precisely to help us rapidly create the conditions for industrialization while recovering from the wounds of war. We see that the Soviet Union's loan to China is entirely delivered in the form of industrial machinery, equipment, and materials, which is unimaginable in the capitalist world. Capitalist countries' loans to foreign countries are intended to control the economy of those countries and sell their own surplus consumer goods. No capitalist country has ever used loans to help another country industrialize. We Chinese people have a lot of experience in this regard: Japanese imperialism, which advocated "Sino-Japanese economic cooperation," aimed to realize its goal of "industrial Japan, agricultural China"; US imperialism, which advocated "Sino-American economic cooperation," aimed to realize its goal of "industrial America, agricultural China." The poison pills wrapped in their sugarcoating were intended to keep China in a state of agricultural backwardness forever, so that it could become their colony. Even in France under the "Marshall Plan," we know that 33 percent of its annual imports come from the United States, and among these large imports of American goods, production equipment accounts for only 2 percent, while the rest are things like glass socks, chewing gum, tobacco, and milk powder. Therefore, truly selfless economic assistance and economic cooperation are only possible between socialist countries and new democratic countries, just as stipulated in the "Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance": "The two contracting parties undertake, in the spirit of friendly cooperation and in accordance with the principles of equality, mutual benefit, mutual respect for national sovereignty and territorial integrity, and non-interference in each other's internal affairs, to develop and consolidate the economic and cultural relations between China and the Soviet Union, to provide each other with all possible economic assistance, and to carry out necessary economic cooperation." The Soviet agreement to help China industrialize through loans is precisely the initial and concrete implementation of this genuine economic assistance and economic cooperation. We believe that socialist Soviet Union, based on heavy industry, will deliver industrial machinery, equipment and materials, manufactured with its most advanced scientific and technological standards, to us in the form of loans, coupled with the specific and enthusiastic guidance of Soviet technical experts, and this will have a tremendous revolutionary impact on the improvement of our productivity. The imperialists are threatening us with "blockades," fantasizing that we will have to rely on them, fantasizing that we will eventually yield to them, let them continue to fantasize forever!
    Someone asked: "Are the 300 million US dollars worth of goods that the Soviet Union is giving us their 'surplus materials'?"
    This question is raised because of a lack of understanding of the Soviet socialist system. We know that under the socialist system, the means of production are publicly owned, and all production is carried out strictly according to plan. There is no contradiction between production and consumption, and distribution. Therefore, there is no anarchy of production or surplus production in socialist countries, and there is no such thing as "surplus materials." Moreover, the Soviet Union is currently in the first new Five-Year Plan after the war (1946 to 1950), which is still a plan for the recovery and development of the economy, because the Soviet Union suffered the most damage in the four-year anti-fascist war, especially in terms of industry. And what is being delivered to China this time is entirely industrial machinery, equipment and materials, so there is even less talk of so-called "surplus materials." In fact, the Soviet Union's method of lending is entirely a selfless and righteous assistance.
    Someone asked: "Why is this loan only for 300 million US dollars, and not more?"
    We believe that our government's request to the Soviet government for this amount, and no more or less, was made after careful calculation. Our efforts to obtain foreign aid should be based on the principle of self-reliance and hard work, and to seek the most necessary assistance for restoring and developing production. The Chinese people have always been a diligent, thrifty, brave, and intelligent people. As long as we obtain the most necessary assistance for restoring and developing production, we can give greater play to our wisdom and efforts, and make every penny count. In this way, the spirit of mainly relying on our own hard work to create a new life is the sign of a prosperous country. Based on this spirit, we have borrowed 300 million US dollars in aid, which is a very large amount and can play a great role in the recovery of our economy. In the past, the reactionary governments of China also borrowed money from foreign countries, but what they borrowed was not used for production and construction, but for warlords to fight civil wars and carry out anti-people wars, and for warlords and reactionary rulers to spend lavishly; the Chiang Kai-shek clique has reached the peak of extravagance, borrowing as much as 6 billion US dollars in "US aid" from US imperialism. Apart from taking an extremely small amount for the "relief" used by the US-Chiang clique to deceive the people, all of it was used to fight civil wars, slaughter millions of Chinese people, and for the extravagant and dissolute spending of the Four Families. And the foreign debts they borrowed from imperialism were all "mortgaged" with China's rights and interests, and conditioned on selling China to imperialism. This is, of course, fundamentally incomparable to the borrowing of our great people's country from its fraternal countries, and the generous assistance of our fraternal countries to us.
    Regarding the repayment period, it is stipulated that it will only begin in the fifth year, and will be paid off in ten years (1954-63). The slowness and length of this period are truly more considerate to the borrower than to the lender. In fact, after China gradually obtains 300 million US dollars of machinery and equipment in five years, production will be reproduced, capital will be accumulated and then accumulated again. In fifteen years, it will really be a return of ten thousand for one. The Soviet Union, after five years, will gradually recover only a little old capital and negligible interest. Besides true brotherly love, what else can explain this!
    Finally, let's talk about interest. As everyone knows, the low interest rate of 1% per annum is unprecedented in the history of international capitalist lending and in the history of foreign debt in modern China; and the method of calculating interest "based on the actual amount of the loan used and starting from the date of its use" (Article 3 of the Loan Agreement) is an unprecedentedly favorable method in the history of lending.
    In short, this loan agreement, as Vyshinsky pointed out: "The determination of our two peoples to develop and consolidate the economic and cultural relations between the Soviet Union and China and to provide each other with economic assistance has become the basis for the Soviet Union to grant the People's Republic of China a long-term economic loan agreement." Its help to China's economic recovery is so great, as Chairman Mao said: "The friendship of the Soviet Union is something that the Chinese people will never forget."

　　关于苏联贷款给中国
　　胡华
    根据中苏“关于贷款给中华人民共和国的协定”，苏联在一九五○年到一九五四年的五年内，将贷给我国三万万美元，作为我们偿付苏联所交予的机器装备和器材之用，每年仅付年利百分之一，贷款的付还从一九五四年开始，到一九六三年，分十年还清。
    苏联政府贷款给中国的意义，首先是为了帮助中国人民迅速地恢复被长期战争所破坏的人民经济。
    大家知道，中国人民处在全国规模的战争环境之中已有十三年之久。从一九三七年开始的日本帝国主义所发动的对华侵略战争和从日本投降以来的美帝国主义所援助的国民党反动派所发动的反人民内战，使灾难深重的中国人民为了求得自己的解放不能不处在长期的艰苦流血抗战中，战争对中国经济的破坏是很严重的；再加上由于在二十七年的长时间内，以蒋介石为首的四大家族匪帮和外国帝国主义者对中国经济的竭力摧残，就使中国陷在经济衰落的境地，就使胜利后的中国人民不能不面临着严重的经济困难。摆在我们面前的任务，首先是要医治百孔千疮的战争创伤，并向灾荒作斗争。毛主席说，我们是“有困难、有办法、有希望”的，这个办法、这个希望，就是我们的开源节流、自力更生，就是苏联向中国人民伸出了热情援助之手——慷慨地给我们以巨款的借贷。中国是个经济落后的农业国，要医治战争的创伤，恢复被破坏的经济，首先迫切需要的是各种工业机器和器材，苏联的贷款，正是在这方面着实的帮助了我们。
    苏联政府贷款给中国，同时还是为了加速中国的工业化。
    大家知道，要使中国变为一个强盛和繁荣的国家，最重要的就是要增加我们人民经济中工业的比重，使中国变为工业化的国家。苏联对中国的贷款，正是帮助我们在恢复战争创伤中，迅速造成工业化的条件。我们看，苏联对中国的贷款，是完全以工业机器设备和器材来交付的，这在资本主义世界是不能想像的事。资本主义国家对外国的贷款，是为了要控制该国的经济，推销自己的过剩消费品，从来没有一个资本主义国家用贷款去帮助另外一个国家工业化的。我们中国人民在这方面是很有经验了：高唱“中日经济提携”的日本帝国主义，是为了要实现它“工业日本，农业中国”的目的；高唱“中美经济合作”的美帝国主义，是为了要实现它“工业美国，农业中国”的目的；它们糖衣里包的毒药是要使中国永世保持着农业国的状态，以便成为他们的殖民地。就是在“马歇尔计划”“援助”下的法国，我们知道它每年输入的百分之三十三是从美国来的，而在这些大量输入的美国货物中，生产装备却只占百分之二，其余都是玻璃袜子、口香糖、烟草、奶粉之类。所以，真正无私的经济援助和经济合作，只有社会主义国家与新民主国家之间才可能有，正像“中苏友好同盟互助条约”内所规定：“缔约国双方保证以友好合作的精神，并遵照平等、互利、互相尊重国家主权与领土完整及不干涉对方内政的原则，发展和巩固中苏两国之间的经济与文化关系，彼此给予一切可能的经济援助，并进行必要的经济合作。”苏联帮助中国工业化的贷款协定，正是这种真正的经济援助与经济合作的初步的具体实施。我们相信，以重工业为基础的社会主义的苏联，以它最先进的科学技术水平所制造出来的工业机器设备和器材，作为给我们贷款的交付品，再加上苏联技术专家们的具体热心指导，这样，就将对我们生产力的提高，发生巨大的革命的影响。帝国主义拿“封锁”来威胁我们，幻想我们将不得不依靠他们，幻想我们终于要向他们就范，让他们永远去幻想吧！
    有人问：“苏联交付给我们的这三亿美元东西，是不是它们的‘剩余物资’呢？”
    提出这个问题，是由于不了解苏联的社会主义制度的缘故。我们知道，在社会主义制度下，生产手段是社会公有的，一切生产都是严密的按照计划进行的，生产与消费、分配，根本没有矛盾，因此在社会主义国家根本不存在生产的无政府状态与生产品过剩的现象，也就根本无所谓“剩余物资”。而且苏联目前还处在战后第一个新五年计划中（一九四六年到一九五○年），这还是一个恢复与发展经济的计划，因为苏联在四年反法西斯战争中遭受破坏最大，尤其是工业方面。而这次交付给中国的则完全是工业机器设备与器材，所以更谈不到是所谓“剩余物资”。实在说，苏联的这种贷款方法，完全是一种舍己为人的道义援助。
    有人问：“为什么这次贷款就贷了三亿美元，而不更多贷些呢？”
    我们相信，我国政府向苏联政府提出这个数目字，而不更多或更少，是经过了缜密的计算的。我们争取外援，应该是在自力更生、勤苦起家的原则下，争取为了恢复和发展生产的最必要的援助。中国人民历来是勤劳、节俭、勇敢而有智慧的人民，我们只要取得了恢复和发展生产的最必要的援助，就可以更大的发挥我们的智慧和努力，精打细算，一个钱当两个用。这样，主要靠自己的勤苦努力来创造新日子的精神，才是国家的兴旺气象。根据这样的精神，我们借得了三万万美金的援助，就是很大的一个数目字，对我国经济的恢复就可以发挥很大的作用。历来中国反动政府也向外国借钱，但是借得来不是用在生产建设上，而是供军阀之间互相打内战、进行反人民战争与供军阀与反动统治者们大浪费大挥霍之用；蒋介石匪帮则更是登峰造极，向美帝国主义借“美援”达六十亿美金之巨，除了拿极其微少的一点点作美蒋欺瞒人民的“救济”之用外，全部拿来打内战，屠杀中国人民数以百万计，以及供四大家族们的骄奢淫佚的挥霍。而他们借帝国主义的外债，都是拿中国的权益去“抵押”，以出卖中国给帝国主义为条件的。这当然根本不能和我们伟大的人民国家向自己兄弟国家借贷，自己兄弟国家对我们慷慨帮助相提并论的。
    关于偿还的期限，规定是到第五年才开始，而又分十年还清（一九五四至六三年）。这个期限之缓之长，真是借钱人比还钱人想得还周到。事实上，我国在五年中陆续取得三亿美元的机器设备和器材之后，生产再生产，积累资金再积累资金，十五年中已经实实在在是一本万利了，而苏联在五年之后所逐渐收回的还只是点老本钱和少到微不足道的利息。这除了真是兄弟友爱之外，还有什么话可以解释呢！
    最后谈到利息。谁都知道，年利百分之一的利率之低微，无论在国际资本主义借贷史上，无论在近代中国外债史上都是找不到先例的；而计息方法“以使用贷款的实数并自其使用之日起实行计息”（贷款协定第三条），这在借贷史上也是破例的优惠办法。
    总之，这个贷款协定，正像维辛斯基所指出：“我们两国人民发展和巩固苏联与中国之间的经济与文化关系以及互相给予经济援助的决心，就成为苏联允许给予中华人民共和国以长期经济贷款协定的基础。”它对中国经济的恢复帮助之大，真如毛主席所说：“苏联一切的友谊是中国人民所永不会忘记的。”
