Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, February 23rd: The Enlarged Second Executive Committee Meeting of the Fourteenth All-China Students' Federation approved the work report submitted by the Presidium and passed the following resolution:

Significant Achievements in the Past Year

(I)
　　In the past year, under the leadership of the People's Government and the Chinese Communist Party, students across the country have inherited the glorious traditions of the past, implemented the tasks stipulated in the resolution of the Fourteenth All-China Students' Congress, unprecedentedly enhanced their level of awareness and organization, and achieved great results.

　　Before liberation, students waged heroic struggles against imperialism and the Kuomintang reactionaries, resolutely protecting schools; after liberation, they assisted the People's Government in establishing revolutionary order, enthusiastically entered revolutionary cadre schools or actively participated in revolutionary work; students in schools also showed a high degree of learning enthusiasm, striving to transform their thinking, initially establishing a revolutionary worldview, joining the New Democratic Youth League one after another, organizing their own student unions and student associations, and sending their representatives to attend the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and people's congresses in various places. They played an important role in the consolidation and development of the people's democratic regime.

Master Cultural and Scientific Knowledge

(II)
　　Now, the People's Republic of China has been established, and the entire mainland except Tibet has been completely liberated. The Chinese people can now shift their main efforts to peaceful construction work. Therefore, the current basic task of Chinese students is to unite the broad masses of students under the leadership of the People's Government and launch new democratic learning so as to better contribute their talents to the construction of a new democratic China. Currently, students in various regions have already or are about to embark on learning under the guidance of the new democratic education policy; however, there are still a few regions that have not been able to fully understand the fundamental changes in the nature of the student movement, with too many extracurricular non-learning activities, which impede regular study. This phenomenon must be corrected. Some schools have also completely restored the old system of learning, neglecting the conduct of ideological and political education. This phenomenon must also be corrected. Because failing to learn or restoring the old system of learning will prevent us from mastering progressive cultural and scientific knowledge well, and prevent us from completing the tasks assigned by history well.

Cooperate with the Reform of the School System

(III)
　　Experience has proved that the old school system, curriculum, and teaching materials must be appropriately and necessarily reformed. However, such reforms should be carried out and implemented prudently and step by step under the leadership of the educational administration of the People's Government. Students across the country must, from bottom to top, unite with progressive teachers and all teachers to cooperate with and welcome this reform, so as to better implement the new democratic education policy and strive to complete their studies and cultivate themselves into useful talents for the construction of new democracy.

Continue to Support the Liberation War

(IV)
　　In the past year, students across the country have resolutely implemented the task of carrying the revolution through to the end. Now, the remaining forces of the Kuomintang bandit gang are still entrenched in Taiwan, Hainan Island, and Tibet. Supported by US imperialism, they are still carrying out harassment and sabotage, attempting to make a comeback. Students across the country should actively respond to the call of the People's Government, support the People's Liberation Army, and quickly liberate Taiwan, Hainan Island, and Tibet. Students in these regions, in particular, should unite and fight the reactionaries in various ways together with the local people, preparing to welcome liberation.

Strive to Learn Internationalism

(V)
　　In the past year, Chinese students have actively supported the International Union of Students and participated in the international democratic youth and student movement and the world peace movement. In the future, we must work harder to learn internationalism, care for and support the democratic youth and student movements in various parts of the world, especially in Eastern colonial and semi-colonial countries, and stand firmly with the Soviet Union-led peace camp together with the Chinese people, oppose imperialism, and fight to defend lasting peace.

　　全国学联扩大执委会议决议
    中国学生当前基本任务是开展新民主主义学习
    妨碍正课学习、恢复旧一套，两种偏向都要纠正
    【新华社北京二十三日电】中华全国学生联合会第十四届第二次执行委员会扩大会议同意主席团所提出的工作报告，并通过以下决议：
    过去一年成绩显著
    （一）
　　一来年，全国同学在人民政府和中国共产党领导下承继了过去的光荣传统，执行了中华全国学生第十四届代表大会决议所规定的任务，空前地提高了自己的觉悟程度和组织程度，获得了很大的成绩。
    在解放前，同学们对帝国主义及国民党反动派进行英勇斗争，坚决保护学校；解放以后，协助人民政府建立革命秩序，踊跃进入革命干部学校或积极参加革命工作；在校同学也表现高度的学习积极性，努力改造思想，初步建立革命人生观，纷纷加入了新民主主义青年团，组织了自己的学联和学生会，并派自己的代表出席中国人民政治协商会议和各地人民代表会议。对于人民民主政权的巩固和发展，起着重要的作用。
    掌握文化科学知识
    （二）
　　现在，中华人民共和国已经成立，全国大陆除西藏外已经全部解放，中国人民已有可能把主要力量转入和平建设工作。因此，中国学生当前的基本任务就是要在人民政府的领导下，团结广大同学，展开新民主主义学习，以便更好地贡献自己的才能，建设新民主主义的中国。目前各地区的同学，已经或者即将走上开展新民主主义教育方针下的学习；但是还有少数地区，尚未能够充分地了解学生运动性质的根本改变，课外的非学习性的活动太多，以致妨碍了正课的学习，这种现象是必须纠正的。也有些学校完全恢复了旧一套的学习，忽视思想政治教育的进行，这种现象也是必须纠正的。因为不学习或恢复旧一套的学习，都将使我们不能很好地掌握进步的文化科学知识，不能很好地完成历史所付予的任务。
    配合进行学制改革
    （三）
　　经验证明：旧的学制、课程、教材必须进行适当和必要的改革，但这种改革应当是在人民政府教育行政的领导之下，慎重地、有步骤地进行和实施。全国同学则必须自下而上地同进步教师一道，团结全体教师去配合和迎接这种改革，以便更好地贯彻新民主主义的教育方针，为完成学业，培养自己成为新民主主义建设的有用人才而奋斗。
    继续支援解放战争
    （四）
　　过去一年中，全国同学已坚决执行了将革命进行到底的任务。现在国民党匪帮的残余力量尚盘踞在台湾、海南岛和西藏，它在美帝国主义的扶持下，仍在进行骚扰破坏，妄图卷土重来。全国同学应积极响应人民政府的号召，支援人民解放军，迅速解放台湾、海南岛和西藏。这些地区的同学，尤应团结一致，和当地人民一道，以各种方式向反动派进行斗争，准备迎接解放。
    努力学习国际主义
    （五）
　　一年来中国学生积极拥护国际学联，参加了国际民主青年、学生运动与世界保卫和平运动。今后我们必须更加努力学习国际主义，关心并支援世界各地特别是东方殖民地半殖民地国家的民主青年、学生运动，和中国人民一道，坚决站在以苏联为首的和平阵营，反对帝国主义，为保卫持久和平而斗争。
