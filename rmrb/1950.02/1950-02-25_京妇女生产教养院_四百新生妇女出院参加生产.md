Beijing Women's Production and Rehabilitation Institute
    Four Hundred Newly Reformed Women Discharged to Participate in Production

[Beijing News] Following the Beijing Municipal People's Government's implementation of the resolution from the Second Session of the Municipal People's Representative Conference regarding the closure of brothels, the newly reformed women concentrated in the Women's Production and Rehabilitation Institute have made significant progress after more than three months of political, ideological, and cultural study. As of February 24th, 425 students have been discharged from the institute. Among them, 215 have returned home, 151 have married, and the others have gone to old-age homes or hospitals for treatment. Most of the students in the rehabilitation institute came from rural backgrounds. Those returning home this time have mostly been allocated land and their lives will not be problematic, and they will all participate in production. One student, Wang Xiuyun, returned home just in time for the land reform, was allocated land and housing, and was extremely happy. The rehabilitation institute carefully vetted the partners of the students who were discharged to marry. The men were required to have legitimate occupations and to be mutually willing with the female students. Before marriage, both parties underwent examinations and treatment at the venereal disease prevention clinic of the health bureau to prevent the spread of venereal diseases. The municipal government has purchased 47 weaving machines, 27 sock knitting machines, and eight winding machines (all electric) as well as ten spinning wheels for the students still remaining in the rehabilitation institute and prepared raw materials such as white cloth and embroidery thread for them to use for embroidery work. Some of the students have joined nursing work, and some have been admitted to the Beijing People's Art Theater. The treatment of venereal diseases has also been basically completed. When they were first concentrated, the results of the physical examination of all students showed that more than 95% had syphilis, gonorrhea, etc. The municipal government spent more than 100 million yuan (equivalent to 120,000 jin of millet) on medical expenses for their treatment. Most of their venereal diseases have been cured, and most are no longer infectious.
