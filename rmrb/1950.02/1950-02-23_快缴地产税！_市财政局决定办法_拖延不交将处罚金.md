　　Pay Your Property Tax Quickly!
    Municipal Finance Bureau Decides on Measures; Delay in Payment Will Result in Fines
    [Beijing News] More than a month has passed since the Beijing Municipal 1949 Property Tax was levied, and 90% of property owners have already paid. More than 6,000 households have not yet paid, and most are more than ten days past the legal payment deadline. The Municipal Finance Bureau, in accordance with the provisions of the Finance and Tax Document No. 1 promulgated on January 29th, has decided that in addition to imposing fines on those who deliberately delay payment, to ensure that the government's financial revenue is not lost and that those who pay their taxes early do not suffer, from now on, the price of rice for property tax, whether applying for postponement or not, will be calculated based on the average wholesale price of Fudi millet and Kou millet in the market as published in the People's Daily on the day of payment. Property owners in all areas who have not yet paid their taxes should take their old payment notices to the Real Estate Tax Section of the Revenue Planning and Finance Division of the Municipal Finance Bureau at No. 1 Chengen Temple to exchange for new payment notices.
