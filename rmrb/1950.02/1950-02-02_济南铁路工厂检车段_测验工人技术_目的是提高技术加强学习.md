Jinan Railway Factory Rolling Stock Section
	Testing Workers' Skills
	Aim is to Improve Technology and Strengthen Learning
	[Our Newspaper News] Shandong News: In order to encourage workers to strengthen their professional studies and improve their technical level, the Jinan Railway Factory Rolling Stock Section specially formed an examination committee composed of representatives from the Party, government, labor union, youth league, and work team, together with technical workers, and held a technical test in mid-December of last year. Before the test, some workers who only had practical work experience and lacked theoretical knowledge were afraid of failing the exam and being demoted, and were unwilling to participate in the test. After repeated explanations by the examination committee, clarifying that the purpose of the test was to improve technology and strengthen learning, and that the results of this exam would not affect their current job positions, the workers' concerns were gradually dispelled. The test time was on Sundays, and master craftsmen and assistant craftsmen were tested separately. The assistant craftsmen's test was divided into three types: written test, oral test, and observation; the master craftsmen only took a written test. The test questions were drafted by technical experts from the examination committee based on the needs of each unit's work, and then selected by all responsible comrades of the examination committee through joint research. The grading standards were determined by technical experts in the examination committee based on reference books. When grading, in order to take care of workers with lower cultural levels, it was stipulated that the grades would not be affected by ungrammatical sentences or typos. After the test ended, the following effects were achieved: First, the leadership generally understood the actual skills of each worker. Second, the workers generally realized that their existing technical level was not up to the needs of the work, corrected their pride in being satisfied with their qualifications, established the idea that only with good technology can they undertake greater work, and generally improved their enthusiasm for technical learning. For example, the workers in the hook department and the repair group immediately formed three technical learning groups after the test, more than half of whom were craftsmen. Ordinary older workers realized that work experience alone is not enough, and that they must study theory and combine theory with experience to do a good job. Illiterate workers realized that not only is learning technology important, but learning culture is also important. In the past, the section had technical learning groups, which used the method of signing "technical learning mutual aid covenants" to organize workers to learn. After this test, because most workers actively demanded to learn, the "mutual aid covenant" learning groups were consolidated and strengthened.

　　济南铁路工厂检车段
    测验工人技术
    目的是提高技术加强学习
    【本报讯】山东消息：济南铁路工厂检车段为了鼓励工人加强业务学习，提高技术水平，特由党、政、工、团及工作组代表与技术工人共同组成考试委员会，于去年十二月中，举行技术测验。测验以前，部分只有实际工作经验而缺乏理论知识的工人，怕考不及格被降职，不愿参加测验。经考委会再三解释，说明测验目的是为了提高技术与加强学习，这次考试成绩的优劣绝不影响现有工作职位，才逐渐打消了工人的顾虑。测验时间在星期日，正匠与帮匠分别举行。帮匠的考试分笔试、口试和观测三种；正匠则仅作笔试。试题由考委会中之精通技术者，根据各单位工作的需要拟出草题，再经考委会全体负责同志共同研究选定。评卷标准由考委会中精通技术者根据参考书研究订出。评卷时为照顾文化较低的工人，规定成绩不受词句不通顺与错别字的影响。测验结束以后，得到如下效果：一、领导上普遍了解了各工友的实际技能。二、工友们普遍认识了自己现有的技术水平，赶不上工作的需要，纠正了满足于资格的骄傲思想，树立了只有具备良好的技术才能担当更大的工作的思想，普遍提高了技术学习的积极性。如钩部与修缮组的工友，在测验后马上成立了三个技术学习小组，其中一组的半数以上都是工匠。一般老年工人认识了只有工作经验还不行，必须学习理论，把理论与经验结合起来才能搞好工作。文盲工人认识到不但学技术重要，学文化也很重要。该段过去原有技术学习小组，用签订“技术学习互助公约”的办法，组织工人学习。经过这次测验，因为大多数工人都积极要求学习，“互助公约”的学习小组得到了巩固与壮大。
