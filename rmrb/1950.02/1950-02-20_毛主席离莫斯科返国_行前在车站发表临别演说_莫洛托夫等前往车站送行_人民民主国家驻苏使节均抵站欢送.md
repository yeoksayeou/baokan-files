Upon leaving Moscow, Chairman Mao delivered a farewell speech over the loudspeaker: Dear Comrades, Friends! During this visit to Moscow, Comrade Zhou Enlai and I, along with other members of the Chinese delegation, met with Marshal Stalin and other responsible comrades of the Soviet government. The full understanding and deep friendship established between us, based on the fundamental interests of the people of China and the Soviet Union, are beyond description. People can see that the unity of the people of the two great powers of China and the Soviet Union, which has already been solidified by treaty, will be permanent, indestructible, and no one can separate it. And this unity will not only inevitably affect the prosperity of the two great powers of China and the Soviet Union, but also inevitably affect the future of mankind and the victory of peace and justice in the world.

During our stay in the Soviet Union, we visited many factories and farms, and witnessed the great achievements of Soviet workers, peasants, and intellectuals in socialist construction. We saw the revolutionary spirit and practical spirit combined in the style cultivated by the Soviet people under the education of Comrade Stalin and the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, and confirmed the long-held belief of the Chinese Communists that the Soviet Union's economic, cultural, and other important construction experiences will become a model for the construction of the new China.

We received a warm reception in Moscow, the capital of the Soviet Union, and in Leningrad, the birthplace of the October Revolution. As we leave this great socialist capital, we extend our heartfelt thanks to Marshal Stalin, the Soviet government, and the Soviet people.

Long live the eternal friendship and cooperation between China and the Soviet Union!

Long live the Soviet people!

Long live the world revolutionary teacher and the best friend of the Chinese people - Comrade Stalin!
