　　Realism in Old Opera Acting
    An Interview with Famous Wusheng Actor Shang Heyu (Note 1)
　　Wang Chaowen
    Two colleagues and I were discussing old opera, and our attention was greatly drawn to the 70-plus-year-old wusheng actor, Mr. Shang Heyu.

    My two colleagues told me that Mr. Shang had, over his long stage career, developed extraordinary skills and extraordinary insights. They said that this old gentleman, unafraid of the complexities of northern and southern dialects, uses the special methods of opera dialogue and the expressiveness of his voice to quite effectively break through language barriers, allowing the audience to understand the meaning of the words. -- "As long as the speech rhymes, you don't have to worry about them not understanding." By "rhyming," I believe he means the musical expressiveness of the language; this is not common knowledge that ordinary old performers can articulate.

    My two colleagues told me that Mr. Shang believes that some very famous roles are performed carelessly in terms of acting. The way Jiang Wei vomits blood in "Tie Long Mountain" is not vomiting blood, but vomiting wine. They shake their chins, "Eeeerrrr waaaa waaaa," what kind of vomiting blood is that? Blood doesn't come from the mouth like that, and it's not so comfortable when you vomit blood. Vomiting blood must involve shrugging the shoulders and shrinking the neck -- "Ugh." "Ugh." "Ugh."

    Jiang Wei, worn out from battle, is not a drunken Jiang Wei. Some famous actors do not proceed from reality, showing off superficially skilled techniques. Although they can elicit cheers from some audiences, they cannot fool the eyes of experts with a realistic perspective. The conversations of truly insightful experts are beneficial not only to opera actors but also to the progress of any art form. Those formalists who emphasize decorative taste without principle, those tricksters who do not proceed from reality, and especially those theater workers who think that opera is only about designing performances and singing for beauty and pleasantness, and thus neglect the reality of singing and performance, please listen more to the talks of these old artists and learn from them in some aspects.

    Yesterday (Sunday), I and several friends visited Mr. Shang Heyu. This old man, who started learning opera at the age of eight, became a troupe leader at thirty-one and still sought advice from those with cultivation, could still do somersaults in his fifties, and even in his seventies, he was still demonstrating for us while speaking. In one hour, he touched on many issues, and his valuable opinions and information were considerable.

    He believes that wusheng roles always involve "crispness, ruthlessness, and handsomeness (Note 2)." Short-play wusheng roles must have a heroic spirit, and long-play wusheng roles must have the imposing manner of a great general. Some "thin-soled boot wusheng" actors don't understand the wusheng posture; they are only "soft" and "floating." That won't do. Either their chin juts out first, their arms are not rounded, their armpits are not empty, and they appear cramped; or their fists are not aligned with their hips, their punches are not aligned with their chests, their wrists are bent, and they have no strength at all; or they hold their spears crookedly, point their whips without straightening, and don't understand the meaning of "three slashes before the horse" (Note 3) at all; or they are as soft as dan roles, or they jump around like monkeys; they even play Shi Xiu like a thief in the dark in "San Cha Kou," Shi Xiu doesn't look like Shi Xiu, so what heroism can be seen.

    When asked to criticize poorly sung operas, he said, "There are too many, I can't count them all." He stated that he was not talking about these things to "nitpick" (Note 4) but to prevent young people from going down the wrong path. Then, he said that singing is nothing more than emotion and reason. "Sing human plays, don't sing plays as animal plays." He opposes jumping around on stage to please certain audiences, thinking this is exertion, but this kind of effort is worthless. He means that it is not beneficial to the characterization of the characters in the play.

    He said that some people who play Zhuge Liang in "The Empty Fort Strategy" squint and stare as soon as they appear, as if Zhuge Liang has an eye disease. Squinting and staring is okay, but it depends on the situation. For example, when the self-important Ma Su brags, "Ma Su has followed the Prime Minister for many years, and we have been invincible in every attack and every battle, let alone a small Jieting?" At this time, if Kongming uses his eyes to express his opposition, Ma Su knows from the expression in his eyes that he has spoken too boastfully again, and his attitude softens. Only then does it accord with emotion and reason.

    When we were discussing facial expressions, he felt sorry for many actors who neglected facial expressions. Wusheng actors must possess five qualities: "singing, training, sitting, fighting, and tumbling." Only with all five can they be considered a "complete role." Many people only have half a role; that won't do. The skill of "startled bird and frightened snake" (Note 5) of wusheng actors cannot be achieved carelessly. Some people's faces are their own crying faces, not the faces of the characters in the play; some have no expression at all, like wood; that won't do. For example, in the scene where Huang Santai and Dou Erdun stand side by side, the enmity between the two cannot be expressed without looking at each other. You must look at them from top to bottom and from bottom to top for a while before the enmity becomes apparent. This is a very common principle, but it is often overlooked.

    He said that old operas have been tampered with, and the tampered lyrics have become popular and can even please audiences, which is unfair. For example, the currently popular introduction in "The Empty Fort Strategy":

    "Feather fan and scarf, the four-wheeled chariot is as fast as wind and clouds, turning yin and yang in your palm, protecting the Han family, two generations of virtuous ministers."

    Mr. Shang believes that most of these lyrics are wrong. Why should Prime Minister brag? What is the need to ask his subordinates to admire his clothes? The mood when going on an expedition should be:

    "Wielding military power to sweep away the smoke of war, returning all the land to the Han, killing Sima and pacifying the Central Plains, how dare I betray the words of entrusting the orphan?!"

    He believes that this is full of emotion and reason, and it is like the demeanor of a minister who opens up territory and protects the country.

    In "Striking the Drum and Scolding Cao," some people say, "I would rather be a guest under the gate of a loyal person than a person in the tent of a traitor." The old artist believes that what is the difference between a guest under the gate and a person in the tent? It should be "I would rather be a guest under the gate of a loyal person than a guest at the banquet of a traitor." This is more in line with the identity of Mi Heng, who is not without culture.

    One of the visitors asked him why Gao Chong in "Picking the Hua Che" used a sideways step when going up and down the gully (Note 6)? When answering this question, the old man, whose hearing was not good, talked about the "Roll Call" scene. Although his answer was not what was asked, this answer was full of valuable opinions.

    When Yue Fei calls the roll, the four armies are called, but this ambitious General Gao is not mentioned, and he gets angry. But his anger is ultimately that of a general, and ultimately that of a subordinate in front of the commander. The anger of such a character in this environment should have his own demeanor that conforms to emotion, reason, and identity. It is a pity that some wusheng actors who do not understand the principle act recklessly, shaking into a ball, as if General Gao has suddenly developed malaria. This is very bad. There are also people who laugh wildly when they hear Yue Fei's "I see the general's Yintang is dark, so I dare not send you," laughing too without identity. Although the audience applauds such acting, I don't know what is good about it? The proper performance should be: Gao Chong heard that others were being assigned, he thought it would be his turn, and used actions such as wiping his sleeves to express his eagerness to try. When questioning Yue Fei why he didn't send him, it should be:

    Yue Fei, speaking: "...seeing the general star falling in my camp," -- Gao Chong listened attentively in surprise.

    Yue Fei, speaking: "I see that the Prince's Yintang is dark," -- Gao Chong, suspiciously, "Oh."

    Yue Fei, speaking: "So I dare not send you." -- Gao Chong smiled disapprovingly.

    This is not "nonsense" from an "actor," it is a summary of the experience of a dramatic artist. These old people are warehouses of Chinese classical art. They possess rich nourishment for realistic art of all kinds. Such "warehouses" should be valued in our China.

    This old wusheng actor, who emphasizes the realism of acting, is ultimately an old hand in opera. He does not neglect the characteristics of opera because he values realism. He said that the sound of the drum is always nothing more than "dong, dong, dong," but sometimes simply saying "dong" is not rhyming. For example, in "Zhu Lian Zhai," the drum sound is not sung as "dong, dong, dong" but as "hua la la," which shows the reason for the change.

    "Hua la la finished the first drum, (omitted below)" -- flat tone.

    "Hua la la finished the second drum, (omitted below)" -- tone gradually rises.

    "Hua la la finished the third drum, (omitted below)" -- highest tone.

    He means that it cannot meet the requirements of opera music if it is not like this, it cannot be mechanical.

    We did not want to disturb the old man's rest too much, so we had to end this conversation according to our plan. On the way back, a friend who went with me told me that good actors who play Lu Wenlong in "Wang Zuo Breaks His Arm" can have similar advantages. He values the fact that Wang Zuo, who has broken his arm, cannot get on the horse, so he must be helped onto the horse. Therefore, helping him onto the horse is both realistic and has the beauty of acting. This praise is correct; but the beauty of acting and the realism of acting are two sides of the same issue, and they cannot be isolated. Natural forms that have not been stylized are not beautiful enough, and if there is only stylization without realism, it is also ugly. A good opera actor must excel in both.

    (Note 1) Wang Mengsheng's "Pear Garden Anecdotes" in the early Republic of China said: "Shang Heyu is a native of Baodi, Jingdong. Among wusheng actors, he is indeed a truly capable one. Every step, every jump, every strike, and every thrust has its dimensions, perfectly matching the rhythm. Sometimes he stands independently, sometimes he turns like a swallow, calmly and steadily, without any trace of exertion. He is neither biased nor skewed, just right, and every time he sings plays such as "Taking Gao Deng" and "Golden Leopard," people in the performing arts world go to secretly observe him, observing his dance moves, what kind of patterns he makes, what scale he takes, how he responds to the gongs and drums in a fast and slow manner, and roughly his learning is so deep that he completely follows the routines of his predecessors, and it is by no means something that younger generations who rely solely on their agility and physical strength can learn quickly. Sometimes he paints his face and performs Siping Mountain, playing Li Xuanba, his double hammers in hand, weighing a thousand pounds, turning sometimes, lowering and raising with a rhythm, every time he raises his foot, you can see the bottom of his boots (in opera, it is called showing the boot bottom, not raising the foot flat), and the dance ends when the music ends (in opera, it is called the weapon eye). And the gray armor on his body is slightly disorganized, turning smoothly and steeply, fully in accordance with the beat. Before the event, he does not appear hurried, and after it, he acts as if nothing happened. All kinds of skills mostly come from the old styles of "Kunqu" opera, and he internalizes them and uses them appropriately, so he is not only famous for one play and one skill."

    (Note 2) It is a Beijing dialect, meaning lively and unrestrained. I can't think of how to write this word for a while, so I'll just say "handsome."

    (Note 3) 1. Gives a good impression when appearing at the horse gate. 2. Preliminary actions such as Qi Ba. 3. Main singing.

    (Note 4) That is, picking faults with malicious intent.

    (Note 5) "Startled bird and frightened snake" refers to showing agility in a calm and natural manner.

    (Note 6) According to emotion and reason, on a narrow and slippery slope, he slides down; then rides the horse, then goes up, cannot hold on, and slides down sideways again. Actors who do not understand emotion and reason turn around randomly and lose realism.

　　旧剧演技里的现实主义
    访问名武生尚和玉先生（注一）
　　王朝闻
    两位同事和我谈旧戏，对于七十多岁的武生尚和玉先生引起了很大注意。
    两位同事告诉我，尚老先生在长期的舞台生活里，形成了不凡的技艺和不凡的见解。他们说这位老先生不怕复杂的南北方语言的限制，利用歌剧道白的特殊方式，声音的表情，相当有效的冲破语言的隔膜，而让对方体会词义。——“说话只要上韵，不怕他听不懂。”所谓“上韵”，我以为就是语言的音乐性的表情；这不是平常的旧艺人所能道出的常识。
    两位同事告诉我，尚老先生认为：有些很有名望的角色，在演技上胡闹。“铁龙山”姜维吐血的吐法，不是吐血，而是吐酒。他们摇着下巴，“尔尔尔哇哇哇”，这算什么吐血？血，不是口腔里出来的，吐血时也不是那样好受的。吐血，必须是耸肩缩颈，——“呕”。“呕”。“呕”。
    打仗累坏了的姜维，不是喝醉了的姜维，某些名角们不从实际出发，卖弄着表面熟练的技巧，虽然能够引得起某些观众的喝采，可混不过具备着现实主义见解的行家的眼睛。真有见解的行家的谈话，不仅对于歌剧演员有益，对于任何艺术的进步都有益。无原则的强调装饰趣味的形式主义者，取巧的不从实际出发的形式主义者，特别是那些以为歌剧仅止于为了美观、悦耳而设计着演和唱，因而忽视演唱的现实性的某些戏剧工作者，请多倾听这种老艺人的谈话，在某些方面多向这种老艺人学习。
    昨天（星期日）我和几位朋友去拜访了尚和玉先生。这位八岁开始学戏，三十一岁就当老板而还要向有修养的请教，五十多岁时还能翻跟斗，七十多的高龄还边说边为我们表演的老人，在一个钟头里，涉及的问题很多，可贵的意见和资料不少。
    他认为：武生总不离“脆、狠、帅（注二）”，短打戏要有英雄气概，长靠戏要有大将威风。有些“薄底靴武生”不懂武生架子，只有“软”和“漂”。那不行。或者下巴先出去，两臂不圆，两腋不空，而显得局促；或者垂拳不对准跨窠，出拳不对准胸窠，腕部弯曲，全无力量；或者枪歪持，鞭不直指，根本不懂得“马前三刀”（注三）的本意；或者软如青衣，或者乱跳如猴子；把石秀也演成“三岔口”摸黑似的，偷鸡贼似的，石秀不像石秀，还说得到什么英雄。
    再请他批评演唱不好的戏，他说：“太多了，数不完，”他申明：谈这些，不是为了“折毛”（注四），而是为了年青人不走错路。之后，他认为，演唱无非情理二字。“要唱人戏，不要把戏唱成畜戏。”他反对讨好某种观众，在舞台上乱蹦乱跳；以为这是卖力，其实这种气力是不值钱的。意思是说，因为他于剧中人的性格刻画无益。
    他说，有人扮“空城计”里的诸葛亮，一出场就挤眉瞪眼，好像诸葛亮害了眼病似的。挤眉瞪眼是可以的，要看什么地方。比如：自负的马谡吹牛：“马谡随丞相多年，攻无不胜，战无不克，何况小小的街亭？”这时候孔明再用眼睛来表示反对，马谡从这眼睛的表情知道自己又说了大话，态度上软下来。这才合乎情理。
    我们在谈论脸部表情时，他为好些忽视脸部表情的演员可惜。武生要具备“唱、练、坐、打、翻，”五条件，五件俱全，才算是“整个的角色”。好些人只有小半个，那不行。武生的“飞鸟惊蛇”（注五）的功夫不是马虎能得的。有些人的脸是自己的哭脸，不是戏中人的脸；有的全无表情，木头一样；那不行。比如黄三泰和窦尔敦并立的场面，不对看看是不能表现两者之敌意的。必须从上而下，从下而上的看一番，敌意才显明。这是很平常的道理，但常常被人忽略。
    他说，旧戏本被人乱改，乱改的唱词竟然流行，竟然能够讨好观众，这是不公平的。比如目前流行的“空城计”里的引子：
    “羽扇纶巾，四轮车快似风云，阴阳反掌定乾坤，保汉家，两代贤臣。”
    尚老先生认为这词大部分不对。丞相老爷何必吹牛？有何必要叫部下欣赏他的服装呢？出征时的心情，应该是：
    “掌握兵权扫狼烟，全土归汉，杀却司马定中原，怎敢负，托孤遗言？！”
    他认为这才尽情理，才像一个开疆保国的大臣的气度。
    “击鼓骂曹”里，有人“是宁做忠良门下客，不愿作奸贼帐中人”。老艺人认为，门下客与帐中人有何区别？应该是“宁做忠良门下客，不愿做奸贼席上宾。”这才比较符合并非毫无文化的弥衡的身份。
    拜访者之一问他，“挑滑车”里的高冲，在上下沟道时为什么要用横步的原因？（注六）这位耳朵不灵的老人，回答这个问题的时候，他谈到“点将”一场去了。虽然答非所问，这回答里充满了可珍贵的意见。
    岳飞点将，四路兵马点齐，不提到这位不甘落后的高将军，他生气了。但他生气，到底是一个将军，到底是在主帅面前的部下。这种人物在这种环境下的生气，应有他符合情理符合身份的气派。可惜不懂道理的某些武生，乱来，抖成一团，好像高将军忽然发起疟子来了似的。这很不好。也有人在听到岳飞的“我观将军印堂黑暗，故尔不敢相遣”时狂笑起来，笑得太没身份。对于这种演技，观众虽然叫好，我不知好在那里？正当的表演应该是：高冲听到分派别人，他以为就会轮到自己，用抹袖等等动作，表现他跃跃欲试的心理。在质问岳飞为什么不派他时，应该是：
    岳飞白：“……看将星坠落我营，”——高冲注意的吃惊的听。
    岳飞白：“我观王爷印堂黑暗，”——高冲怀疑的“哦”。
    岳飞白：“故尔不敢相遣。”——高冲不以为然的笑笑。
    这不是“戏子”的“扯淡”，这是戏剧艺术家的经验总结。这些老人是中国古典艺术的仓库，他们具备着现实主义艺术的或种丰富的营养，对于我们中国，这样的“仓库”，应该重视。
    这位强调演技的现实性的老武生，到底又是歌剧的老把手，他没有因为重视现实性而忽视作为歌剧的特点。他说，鼓的声音总不外“咚咚咚”，但有时太老实的念“咚”就无韵。比如“珠帘寨”里鼓声不唱成“咚咚咚”而是“花啦啦”，就有说明该变的道理。
    “花啦啦打罢了头通鼓，（下略）”——调平。
    “花啦啦打罢了二通鼓，（下略）”——调渐高。
    “花啦啦打罢了三通鼓，（下略）”——调最高。
    他的意思是说，不如此不能符合歌剧音乐的要求，机械不得。
    我们不愿太多妨碍老人的休息，只得按我们计划结束这一次的谈话。在归途，同去的朋友告诉我：“王佐断臂”里，扮演陆文龙的好演员能有类似的好处。他重视断了臂的王佐是扶不上马的，必须抱他上马，因此，抱他上马，这动作又逼真，又有演技的美。这称赞是对的；但演技的美和演技的现实性是一个问题的两方面，孤立不得。没有经过样式化的自然形态不够美，只有样式化而无现实性，那也是丑的。好歌剧演员，必兼长二者。
    （注一）民初王梦生“梨园佳话”云：“尚和玉京东宝坻人，武生中确有真能力者。一步一跃、一击一刺，皆具尺寸，妙合音节。或独立如，或平翻似燕，从容稳练，绝无努力吃重之痕。不偏不陂，适可而止，每唱“拿高登”“金钱豹”等剧，伶界中人均往窃视，察其舞弄，作何花式，抬步作何尺度，急徐间若何与金鼓相应，大抵其学力深至，全守先辈程范，断非后生专恃质敏力裕，猝欲学步者所能。有时绘面演四平山，扮李玄霸，其双锤在手，重若千钧，转动有时，低扬有节，每抬足则见其底（戏中谓之亮靴底，非足抬平不见），止舞则乐终其声（戏中谓之家伙眼）。且灰靠在身，略无紊乱，平翻陡转，全符节拍。未事时不形匆遽，已过后若无事然。种种艺能，多由“昆曲”中排场旧式而出，而从心化之，用得其当，固不独以一剧一艺显者。”
    （注二）是北京地方话，大意是活泼洒脱。一时想不出这字该如何写法，姑且说成“帅”。
    （注三）一、出马门亮相时给人的好印象。二、起霸等等初步动作。三、主要的演唱。
    （注四）即不怀好意的挑毛病。
    （注五）“飞鸟惊蛇”是指在从容、自然中显示敏捷。
    （注六）按情理，马上狭隘的坡路，滑下；再打马，再上，支持不住，横着身子又滑下来。不理解情理的演员，乱转，失去了现实性。
