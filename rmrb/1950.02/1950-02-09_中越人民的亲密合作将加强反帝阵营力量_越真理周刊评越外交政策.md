　　Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, February 8th: The Vietnam News Agency reported on the 6th that Vietnam's most influential "Truth" Weekly published an article on January 25th commenting on Vietnam's foreign policy, stating: Since coming to power, the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam's foreign policy has been consistent. The Democratic Republic of Vietnam has steadfastly stood in the international democratic camp led by the Soviet Union and has repeatedly expressed its willingness to establish friendly relations with all countries on the basis of equality and mutual respect for national sovereignty and territorial integrity.

　　The article continued: Now standing to our north is no longer the reactionary accomplice of the French imperialists, but a loyal friend—the People's Republic of China. The close cooperation between the people of China and Vietnam will surely strengthen the peaceful forces of the international anti-imperialist camp.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, February 8th: TASS, Moscow, reported on the 6th that Pravda reporter Zhukov reported from Paris: Franco-Vietnamese relations are currently one of the most thorny issues in French political life. Political circles in Paris believe that the French parliament's ratification of the Auriol-Bao Dai agreement and the arrival of Truman's special envoy Jessup in Vietnam are directly related. On January 27th, while the French parliament's debate on the ratification of the "Franco-Vietnamese Agreement" was still ongoing, Jessup visited Bao Dai, deliberately congratulating Bao Dai on the agreement's ratification. The US government's contempt for its vassal France has reached its extreme. But Paris still endured this humiliation.

　　Zhukov pointed out that the purpose of the US-French imperialists' sinister plan for Vietnam is to establish an aggressive base to prepare for a new war. But the French working people know that a nation that oppresses other nations cannot be a free nation, and they are determined to do everything possible to thwart this "dirty war" against Vietnam.

　　中越人民的亲密合作将加强反帝阵营力量
    越真理周刊评越外交政策
    【新华社北京八日电】越南通讯社六日讯：越南最有影响的“真理”周刊，于一月二十五日发表一文，评论越南的外交政策称：越南民主共和国政府自执政以来，它的外交政策的立场是始终如一的。越南民主共和国始终不渝地站在苏联所领导的国际民主阵营中，并曾一再表示愿在平等与互相尊重国家主权和领土完整的基础上与一切国家建立友好关系。
    该文继称：现在站在我们的北面的，已不是法国帝国主义者的反动同谋分子，而是忠实的友人——中华人民共和国。中越两国人民的亲密合作，一定会加强国际反帝国主义阵营的和平力量。
    【新华社北京八日电】据塔斯社莫斯科六日讯：真理报记者朱可夫自巴黎报道称：法越关系是目前法国政治生活中最棘手的问题之一。巴黎政界认为，法国议会的批准阿里奥尔——保大协定，和杜鲁门私人特使耶塞普的抵达越南，有直接关系。一月二十七日，耶塞普在法国议会关于批准“法越协定”的辩论还没有结束时，就去拜访保大，故意向保大祝贺协定的批准。美国政府对其附庸的法国的藐视，已达极点。但巴黎还是照样忍受了这种污辱。
    朱可夫指出美法帝国主义对越南的罪恶计划的目的，是要建立侵略基地，准备新战争。但法国劳动人民知道，压迫其他民族的民族，不能够是自由的民族，他们坚决地尽一切努力来挫败这一对越南的“肮脏战争”。
