Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, 16th: The news of the signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance and other agreements sparked another great celebration in Nanjing by people from all walks of life, the largest since the founding of the People's Republic of China. On the afternoon of the 15th, people from Nanjing's various institutions, military units, factories, schools, and industrial and commercial sectors marched in teams, with the national flags of China and the Soviet Union and giant portraits of Chairman Mao and Stalin shining brightly. Fireworks exploded and cheers resounded along the way. Slogans such as "Thank you for the great brotherly assistance of the Soviet Union!", "Long live the friendship and cooperation between China and the Soviet Union!", "Long live Chairman Mao!", and "Long live Stalin!" shook the ancient city of Nanjing. More than 2,500 cultural and educational workers from the city, who were attending the founding meeting of the cultural and educational trade union at the People's Hall, burst into long and sustained applause upon hearing the news of the signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance, and immediately marched out after the meeting. Leading figures from the Nanjing Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, the People's Government, the People's Liberation Army, various democratic parties, and people's organizations issued written statements, unanimously expressing their warm support for the signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance. Tang Liang, Deputy Director of the Nanjing Military Control Commission and Deputy Secretary of the Nanjing Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, wrote in the Xinhua Daily: The signing of this new treaty and new agreement, at a time when our China is recovering from a long period of war and disaster, and at a time when we are facing economic difficulties, provides our construction undertakings with tremendous material and spiritual assistance. For the people of Nanjing, the publication of this new treaty and new agreement will greatly enhance our confidence in engaging in production and construction, and transform the abnormally developed old Nanjing into a prosperous and productive new Nanjing. Ke Qingshi, Deputy Mayor of the Nanjing Municipal People's Government, said: Thanks to the signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance, the people of Nanjing will be filled with even greater confidence and strength, and will bravely advance to overcome difficulties and complete the tasks of 1950. Chen Minzhi, Chairman of the Nanjing Municipal Branch of the China Democratic League, Shao Hengqiu, Chairman of the Preparatory Committee of the Nanjing Municipal Branch of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, and Chen Lu, a member of the Nanjing Municipal Provisional Working Committee of the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party, also made statements, unanimously expressing their support for the new Sino-Soviet treaty and agreement. Shao Hengqiu said: "In the past, some people were deceived by the Chiang Kai-shek bandits and often used the relationship between imperialism and the Chinese people to measure the Soviet Union. This new Sino-Soviet treaty and new agreement, which has great historical significance, is like a good medicine for the eyes, which will wash away the dirt smeared on our eyes by the reactionary government, allowing us to begin to see the facts clearly and recognize the great friendship of the Soviet Union." Jiang Weiqing, Chairman of the Preparatory Committee of the Nanjing Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, resolutely stated on behalf of the 50,000 organized workers in Nanjing: The working class of Nanjing must work hard to produce, overcome difficulties, and learn from the Soviet Union's construction experience. The Nanjing Municipal Peasants' Association Preparatory Committee, the Nanjing Municipal Committee of the Communist Youth League, the Nanjing Municipal Student Federation, and other organizations also issued statements, unanimously supporting the signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance.
