　　Central Film Bureau Propaganda Section · North China Film Manager Company
    Regarding Corrections to the Introduction of "The Childhood of Maxim Gorky"

　　The program for the Soviet film exhibition on the 24th at the Dahua Theater was originally scheduled to be "The Childhood of Maxim Gorky." The Propaganda Section issued a manuscript introducing this film on the 22nd. However, by noon on the 23rd, the Soviet Film Export Company notified the North China Film Manager Company that the film had not been transported to Beijing in time, and the Dahua would instead show "In the Name of the Fatherland" on the 24th. The North China Film Manager Company then notified various newspapers to change the advertisements, but did not immediately notify the Propaganda Section, only verbally informing a comrade in charge of issuing introductory manuscripts in the Propaganda Section at 7:00 PM that day. This comrade believed that the newspapers must have already been typeset and printed, so he did not notify the newspapers to make corrections, nor did he report to the head of the Propaganda Section. Therefore, the error of the introduction in the newspapers not matching the actual film shown was created. In addition to reviewing responsibilities, improving work, and ensuring that the same event does not occur again in the future, we apologize to your newspaper and readers!

    关于《马克西木的少年时代》介绍的更正
    苏联影片展览二十四日大华节目，原定为《马克西木的少年时代》。宣传科于二十二日发出了介绍这个电影的稿件。但，到二十三日午间，苏联影片输出公司才通知华北影片经理公司，说这个电影未能及时运到北京，二十四日大华改演《护国双雄》。华北影片经理公司当时通知了各报纸改动广告，而未即时通知宣传科，只在当日下午七时才口头通知了宣传科负责发介绍稿的一位同志。这位同志认为报纸一定已经排印了，便没有通知报纸设法改正，也未报告宣传科的负责人。因此，便造成报纸上的介绍和实际映出的电影不一样的错误。我们除进行检讨责任，改善工作，保证今后不再发生同样的事件外，并向贵报及读者道歉！
