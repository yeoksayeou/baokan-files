　　【This newspaper dispatch】 Reporter Li Wen reports: Lanzhou Municipality has overfulfilled its public bond sales task, becoming the second city in the Northwest region, after Xi'an, to complete the task. As of the 7th, the number of subscriptions from all sectors has reached 421,975 shares, exceeding the original allocated task of 340,000 shares by over 81,000 shares. Efforts are currently being made to achieve an even higher overage.
    
    The current public bond subscription campaign has demonstrated an unprecedented surge in the patriotic fervor of workers in various factories, staff in various organizations, teachers and students in schools, and people of all ethnic minorities since liberation. In the subscription campaign led by the CPC Gansu Provincial Committee, most cadres in government offices used three months' worth of their stipends, saved on food expenses, or engaged in sideline production such as shearing wool or pasting matchboxes to purchase two to several shares of public bonds; workers in various factories readily contributed one-third or even all of their annual bonuses to subscribe to public bonds. Various government offices, factories, and schools also utilized their spare time to organize propaganda teams and purchase promotion groups to conduct street propaganda and go deep into households to promote purchases. Postal workers also encouraged recipients to purchase bonds when delivering mail. The landlords of postal workers Xue Kerang and Wang Jianyue, the Zou Huatang family, who were wealthy households, subscribed to 1,000 shares under their active encouragement. Representatives from all sectors at the representative conferences mostly subscribed enthusiastically during the public bond promotion and actively carried out mobilization work.

    Tibetan women value jewelry the most. However, Cao Rui and other female students from the Tibetan People's School took out two gold earrings to buy five shares of public bonds. Tibetan students also stopped using indoor stoves to save coal and buy public bonds with the surplus. Tibetan soldier Huang Zhengqing subscribed to 10,000 shares of public bonds. The Hui people throughout the city also subscribed enthusiastically. Ma Ziqing, a Hui who makes a living selling milk, subscribed to ten shares. Ma Xiwu, a Hui retired official, subscribed to 3,000 shares, demonstrating the ethnic minorities' love for the new China. Only some wealthy households and retired officials, due to a lack of understanding, had a deviation in their understanding of the issuance of Victory Public Bonds. When the subscription figures from the industrial and commercial sectors reached over 85% by the end of last month, their subscription figures were still very low, causing criticism from public opinion in all sectors. The Municipal Promotion Committee then focused on promoting purchases and providing in-depth education. At the beginning of this month, under the influence of provincial government member Huang Zhengqing's subscription of 10,000 shares and wealthy household Wang Tinghan's subscription of 7,000 shares, they all subscribed one after another, enabling Lanzhou Municipality's public bond sales to be overfulfilled.

　　职工学生少数民族人民爱国热忱空前高涨
    兰州市公债推销  超额八万余分
    【本报讯】记者力文报导：兰州市推销公债任务已超额完成，为西北地区继西安后第二个完成任务的城市。截至七日止，各界认购数字已达四十二万一千九百七十五分，超过原配销额三十四万分的任务八万一千余分。现正争取更高的超额数字中。
    此次认购公债运动中，显示出解放后的各工厂职工、各机关工作人员、学校师生以及各少数民族人民爱国热潮的空前高涨。以中共甘肃省委机关带头掀起的竞购运动中，多数机关干部以三个月津贴、节省伙食费或搞撕羊毛、糊火柴盒等业余生产来购买二分至数分公债；各厂职工则纷纷拿出年奖三分之一以至全部来认购公债。各机关、工厂、学校并利用业余时间组织了宣传队、劝购小组，展开街头宣传，深入各户劝购。邮局邮工送信时亦向收信户劝购。邮工薛克让、王剑岳的房东邹华堂是殷实富户，在他们积极劝购下认购了一千分。各界代表会议的代表，在推销公债中，大多踊跃认购，并积极进行动员工作。
    藏族妇女是最重首饰的。藏民学校的女同学曹瑞等却拿出两个金耳环买了五分公债。藏民同学还停止室内生火炉，以节余煤炭买公债。藏族军人黄正清认购公债一万分。全市回民认购亦甚踊跃。卖牛奶为生的回民马子清认购了十分。回民退职官吏马锡武认购三千分。表现出少数民族人民对新中国的热爱。唯有某些殷实富户、退职官吏因不明大义，对发行胜利公债的认识有偏差，至上月底工商界认购数字达百分之八十五以上时，他们认购数字仍旧甚微，引起各界人民舆论的责难。市推销委员会遂有重点地展开劝购并给以深入的教育，在本月初省府委员黄正清认购一万分，殷实富户王廷翰认购七千分的影响下，才各纷纷认购，使兰市公债推销得以超额完成。
