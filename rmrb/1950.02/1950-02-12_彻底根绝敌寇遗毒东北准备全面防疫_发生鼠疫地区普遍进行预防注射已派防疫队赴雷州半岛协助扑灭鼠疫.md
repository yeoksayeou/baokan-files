Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, February 11th: The Northeast People's Government Health Department has formulated an epidemic prevention plan for 1950, preparing to launch large-scale epidemic prevention work with a focus on key areas throughout the Northeast. The plan stipulates that, concerning acute infectious diseases, priority will be given to preventing plague. The Health Department has already concentrated 400 members of the department's directly affiliated mobile epidemic prevention team and epidemic prevention workers from various plague-stricken areas for education. It is scheduled to form three epidemic prevention teams in mid-March to go to Rehe, Tongliao (Inner Mongolia), and Fuyu and Qian'an in Jilin Province to carry out comprehensive epidemic prevention work. In areas where plague has occurred in the past three years, universal live bacteria preventive injections will be administered, while in areas adjacent to plague-stricken areas, dead bacteria vaccine injections will be carried out with a focus on key areas. The department also plans to establish a plague prevention and control institute in Changchun to study methods for eradicating plague and to manufacture live bacteria vaccines, serums, and plague phages. The second priority is the prevention of smallpox. The department plans to eradicate smallpox in the entire Northeast within three years. This year, the Changchun Health Technology Factory and the Dalian Health Research Institute are preparing to manufacture cowpox vaccine for 40 million people, to be used for universal vaccination throughout the Northeast in spring and autumn. To prevent diphtheria, the department is preparing to manufacture diphtheria toxoid for 400,000 people, planned to be distributed to Shenyang, Benxi, Anshan, Fushun, and experimental counties in various provinces in the autumn. To prevent tetanus, the department is preparing to manufacture tetanus toxoid for 280,000 people, mainly for use by the armed forces and industrial and mining sectors. For the prevention of children's infectious diseases such as measles and scarlet fever, emphasis will be placed on publicity and education to popularize public health knowledge among the masses and to promote methods such as injecting maternal blood to prevent measles. In addition, cholera and typhoid vaccines, as well as dysentery phages, will be manufactured to prevent acute infectious diseases of the digestive system. For the prevention and control of chronic infectious diseases, the Health Department has established a tuberculosis prevention and control center and an affiliated tuberculosis hospital in Sujiatun, Shenyang, to accommodate more serious tuberculosis patients in order to gain treatment experience and guide other tuberculosis sanatoriums. The department plans to produce tuberculin for 400,000 people this year for use by the armed forces, workers in key industrial and mining enterprises, and railway employees. It also plans to study the manufacture of BCG vaccine to prevent tuberculosis. In order to eradicate leprosy, which was brought from the south by the Chiang Kai-shek bandit troops in the past, the department began building a leprosy hospital on Xiaowang Island near Zhuanghe in Liaodong Province last winter. After its completion this spring, patients will be concentrated for isolation and treatment.

Furthermore, the Northeast People's Government Health Department, in order to help the plague eradication work in the Leizhou Peninsula area of Guangdong Province, has formed an epidemic prevention team of 144 people, which set off southward on January 28th.
