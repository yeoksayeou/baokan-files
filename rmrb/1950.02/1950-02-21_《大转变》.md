    *The Great Turnaround* – This is a film that all people who seek progress must see. Communist Party members, Communist Youth League members, People's Liberation Army soldiers, and People's Government workers should especially watch this great textbook that promotes the spirit of great revolution.

    When we watch Soviet films, we are often deeply moved, believing that the Soviet people, educated by the Bolshevik Party, are very great.

    Watching *The Great Turnaround* also makes one feel the greatness and precision of Stalin's strategic thinking; recognize the decisive role played by the heroic and invincible Soviet Red Army in the anti-fascist war, and its unparalleled contribution to the future of mankind; and be convinced that the anti-aggression front led by the Soviet Union has sufficient strength to strike at the adventurous provocations of the warmongers, and steadfastly defend world peace.

    These understandings are all good, but if we stop at this level, it is far from enough. Because the educational significance of *The Great Turnaround* lies importantly in connecting it with our own reality and examining our own attitudes at the critical moment of the historic great turnaround, and in peacetime, when the Party gives us relatively difficult tasks that we should complete.

    In this film, we see generals who place their hope for overcoming difficulties and turning the situation around on the temporary allies opening a second battlefield, and we also see generals who do not look at the problem from a global perspective and hope that reinforcements from superiors will complete their own tasks. Although their intentions and expressions are different, under the conditions at the time, they similarly lacked confidence in highly exerting subjective initiative, completing the tasks assigned to them by the high command, and striving for a great turnaround in the overall situation. However, under the same conditions, we also saw Pandaleev, Fedorov, Minutka, and others with one hundred percent Bolshevik qualities. In the face of unprecedentedly arduous tasks, they did not consider whether they could complete them, but only how to complete them, and firmly believed that they could definitely complete them. "There is no place for us on the other side of the river." What a loyal and powerful answer to the call of the superiors and their own tasks!

    Examine ourselves, do we belong to the former or the latter? In the face of the tasks given to us by the Party, have we ever had thoughts of "reluctantly doing our best," "there are too many objective difficulties," "I can only do this much" . . . ?

    I myself was once one of them. I used to treat the Party's requirements with a more or less liberal attitude and accept tasks with a formalistic spirit.

    After watching *The Great Turnaround*, we must first seriously examine ourselves and demand a great turnaround from ourselves! (Attached picture)

　　《大转变》
　　亚群
    《大转变》—这是一切要求进步的人们不可不看的影片，共产党员、青年团员、人民解放军战士和人民政府工作人员特别应该看一看这部宣传伟大革命精神的伟大教科书。
    看苏联的影片，我们常常受到一种深刻的感动，认为在布尔塞维克党教育下的苏联人民是很伟大的。
    看《大转变》这一影片，同样，也使人感到斯大林战略思想的伟大，精密；认识英雄无敌的苏联红军在反法西斯战争所中起的决定性的作用，对人类前途无比的供献；以及确信今后以苏联为首的反侵略阵线，有足够的力量打击战争贩子们的冒险挑衅，坚强地保卫世界和平。
    这些认识都是不错的，但，如果仅仅停止于这样的水平，还非常不够。因为《大转变》这一影片，它的教育意义，重要的还在于联系我们的实际，检查我们自己在历史性的大转变的关头，以及在平时，党给予我们应当完成的，比较艰难的任务面前，我们是采取的什么态度？
    在这一影片中，我们看见了把克服困难，扭转大局的希望寄托在暂时的同盟者开辟第二战场的将军，也看见了不从全局看问题，希望上级增援力量来完成自己任务的将军。他们的意图和表现形式虽各有不同，但，在当时的条件下，高度地发挥主观的能动力，完成统帅部给予自己的任务，争取全局大转变的信心不够则是一样的。然而在同样的条件下，我们也看见了百分之百的布尔塞维克品质的潘达列也夫，菲道洛夫，米奴特卡等人。他们在空前艰巨的任务面前，不考虑能不能完成，只考虑如何去完成，而且坚信自己一定能完成。“河的对岸没有我们的地方。”这是对待上级的号召和自己的任务的多么忠诚有力的回答！
    检查自己吧，我们是属于前者呢？还是属于后者？在党给予自己的任务面前，我们是否有过，“勉为其难”，“客观的困难太多”，“我只能做到这样”………的思想呢？
    我自己就曾经是其中的一个。我曾经是或多或少以自由主义的态度来对待党的要求，以形式主义的精神来接受任务的。
    看了《大转变》，我们必须首先严肃地检查自己，要求自己来一个大转变！（附图片）
