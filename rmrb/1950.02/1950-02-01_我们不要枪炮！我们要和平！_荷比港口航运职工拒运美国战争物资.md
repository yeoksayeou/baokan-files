    Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, January 31st. TASS reports: The movement of laboring people in the Netherlands and Belgium refusing to transport war materials is expanding.
    The call from the Rotterdam Port Peace Committee in the Netherlands to not load or unload American war materials has been enthusiastically responded to by hundreds of shipping company employees in Amsterdam, Rotterdam, and other ports. Rotterdam dockworkers resolutely declared: "We don't want guns! We want peace!" Metal workers in Schiedam, west of Rotterdam, also held a meeting, announcing their support for the Rotterdam dockworkers and sending a letter to the Dutch government stating: "American military supplies to the Netherlands are a threat to peace and we demand that the government refuse to accept them." At the same time, a group of Indonesian workers in Rotterdam and The Hague also protested against American military supplies.
    Dockworkers in Ostend, Belgium, held a meeting on the 27th and decided not to unload American arms that were about to arrive at Belgian ports, expressing solidarity with dockworkers in Antwerp and French, Belgian, Italian and Danish ports who had made similar decisions.
