Xinhua News Agency, Zhadanov, February 22nd dispatch: Metallurgical workers at the Azovstal Iron and Steel Works are commemorating the 32nd anniversary of the founding of the Soviet Army with Stakhanovite labor. More than a thousand workers in the steel plant participated in the Patriotic War and were awarded medals and decorations for their heroic achievements. The outstanding hero and young scout, Kurilov, who was awarded the title of Hero of the Soviet Union in the Battle of Berlin, is now operating a powerful rail rolling mill and has become a Stakhanovite worker. Using new working methods, he turns a ton and a half of steel ingots into rails in 28 seconds. Advanced technology has helped him apply acceleration methods, and in two years, Kurilov has over-fulfilled the plan by producing metal for eight trains. Kurilov also organized a Stakhanov school, from which fifty of his students have graduated and are now working in various metallurgical enterprises in Ukraine. He is now passing on his knowledge to young metallurgists from the Georgian Republic who have come here to study, and is giving lectures on accelerated working methods to students at the Zhadanov Metallurgical Special School.
