　　People's Bank of Yuci Branch Issues Livestock Loans, Organizes Transportation to Ensure Specific Use of Funds

    [Our News] The Yuci Branch of the People's Bank of China is actively issuing livestock loans to help the masses organize transportation and sales. In order to promote winter production, the branch began to understand the production situation in the county at the beginning of November last year, and found that the main difficulties in the current mass production are the lack of livestock and fertilizer. It is estimated that the county is short of about 1,100 head of livestock. Therefore, issuing livestock loans to increase animal power and organize mass transportation is a central link in promoting winter production. The branch then decided to vigorously issue livestock loans according to the provincial bank's winter loan policy. The lending methods adopted are as follows: First, in villages with cooperatives, loans are issued through the cooperatives. Combined with publicity, credit activities are gradually restored in order to absorb idle funds into the transportation industry. In total, nearly 90,000 jin of millet and nearly 20,000 jin of wheat have been lent out through 26 cooperatives in the county. Second, in areas without cooperatives, the branch directly manages the loans and distributes them through district and village cadres. Because these loans are well managed, the branch's subsequent investigation found that some villages not only truly ensured the specific use of funds and solved the difficulties of livestock in transportation, but also prepared favorable conditions for the branch to recover old loans. For example, some village cooperatives in the first, second, and fourth districts sent people to Taiyuan and other places to purchase livestock for their members after they received the loan repayment. Due to collective purchases, each head of livestock can save an average of 1.5 dan of millet. Currently, 170 head of livestock have been purchased, saving a total of 225 dan of millet. Many people in various places have obtained production funds, which has also guaranteed the bank's recovery of old loans. In total, by the end of January this year, the county had lent out more than 150,000 jin of millet and more than 68,000 jin of wheat, plus approximately 200,000 jin of millet in private funds from the masses, purchasing 12 head of cattle, 23 horses, 92 mules, and 181 donkeys, totaling 308 head. The main reason why this loan achieved such remarkable results is that the branch conducted strict inspections of the use of the funds from the beginning, ensuring that the loans were used for their specific purposes. When it was discovered that some loan recipients had not used the loans to purchase livestock but for other purposes, the branch immediately recovered the loans and gave them appropriate criticism and education. As a result, the masses were able to use all the loans to purchase livestock.

　　人民银行榆次支行发放牲口贷款
    组织运输保证专款专用
    【本报讯】中国人民银行榆次支行，积极发放牲口贷款，扶助群众组织运销。该行为开展冬季生产，于去年十一月初，即开始了解全县生产情况，发觉当前群众生产中的主要困难，系牲口与肥料的缺少。据估计全县缺少牲口约一千一百余头。故发放牲口贷款增加畜力组织群众运输，为推动冬季生产的中心一环。该行遂根据省行冬贷方针，确定大力发放牲口贷款。其贷放办法采取如下两种：一、有合作社的村，通过合作社发放。并结合宣传，逐步恢复信用活动，以便吸收闲散游资投入运输事业。总计全县已通过二十六个合作社，贷出小米近九万斤、麦子近二万斤。二、无合作社地区，则由支行直接掌握，通过区村干部进行发放。这些贷款由于掌握得好，事后经该支行调查：有的村不但真正做到了专款专用，解决了运输上牲口的困难；同时给该行催收旧贷准备了有利条件。如一、二、四区有的村社贷回款项后，即派人赴太原等地购买牲口供给社员。由于集体购买，每头牲口平均可节省小米一石五斗。现已购回牲口一七○头，共节省小米二二五石。各地很多群众获得生产资金，使银行对收回旧贷亦有了保证。总计全县至今年一月底止，共贷出小米十五万余斤、麦子六万八千多斤，加上群众私资小米约二十万斤，共买回牛十二头、马二十三匹、骡九十二头、驴一百八十一头，共三百零八头。此次贷款之所以获得如此显著成绩，主要在于该行一开始即进行严格检查用途，保证了贷款的专款专用。当发现有贷款户未将贷款用于购买牲口而作其他用途时，该行即收回贷款，并予以适当的批评教育。因而使群众能将贷款全部用于购买牲口。
