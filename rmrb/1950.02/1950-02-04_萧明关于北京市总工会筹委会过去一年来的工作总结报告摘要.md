　　Excerpts from Xiao Ming's Summary Report on the Work of the Beijing Federation of Trade Unions Preparatory Committee Over the Past Year

    The work of the Beijing Federation of Trade Unions Preparatory Committee over the past year has been fruitful. It has organized 47.7% of the city's working class, led workers in their efforts to restore and develop production, and appropriately ensured the workers' livelihoods. In the process of organizing trade unions, it has conducted general political and policy education and trade union organizational education, which has raised the workers' class consciousness. Whether in restoring and developing production or participating in the capital's various construction projects, the working class has demonstrated its vanguard exemplary role. The main reasons for achieving these results are the direct and correct leadership of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China and the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, especially the Municipal Committee's regular specific leadership and assistance, the efforts of all trade union workers, the active efforts of the broad masses of workers, and the assistance from all sides.
        Organized 47.7% of the City's Workers
    The trade union organizational work over the past year has been carried out under the general guidelines of uniting, organizing, and educating all workers, raising workers' awareness, and restoring and developing production. According to December statistics, 85 formal city-wide and industry-specific trade unions have been established in state-owned industries, private industries, handicrafts, shop employees, transportation workers, cultural and educational workers, and newspaper offices, along with 21 preparatory committees. The education workers' union is still in the preparatory stage. Among them, 12 formal trade unions have been established in universities, and 7 preparatory committees. Sixty-four formal trade unions have been established in middle schools, and 26 preparatory committees. Nine formal trade unions have been established in primary schools by district, and 3 preparatory committees. A total of 186,158 members, accounting for 47.7% of the total of 390,605 people.
    In terms of cultivating and promoting trade union cadres: There are currently 470 trade union cadres at all levels, chairmen and vice-chairmen, 2,342 committee members, 4,601 staff members, and 10,115 group leaders. Thirty-seven people have been promoted to work in the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions and various district offices. A total of 17,565 cadres above the level of trade union group leader have been promoted and cultivated. Seven thousand seven hundred and ninety-one people have been promoted to other departments such as factory management, government, other people's organizations, factory branches, cooperatives, and the Beijing Municipal Public Security Team.
    There are 3,990 female workers who are members, accounting for 81% of the total of 4,887 female workers. A total of more than 4,200 female workers participated in various training classes and study groups, accounting for 90% of all female workers. In production and study, 856 female worker cadres were trained and promoted.
    The main experiences and lessons learned in organizational work over the past year are:
    1.  In the early days of liberation, the work groups sent to various factories played a significant role in mobilizing workers, protecting factories, eliminating counter-revolutionaries, assisting in the takeover, restoring production, educating workers, raising workers' awareness, and solving some of the workers' living and welfare problems. Therefore, the work group was an effective and necessary organizational form at the beginning of the work, but if the work group is not abolished after the formal establishment of the trade union, it will hinder the development and soundness of the trade union work. In the past, the work groups in some factories were not abolished in time, which hindered the development of trade union work, and this was basically overcome after April.
    2.  In the early stages of liberation, organizational work had a tendency toward closed-doorism. After several inspections after April, this closed-doorism tendency was corrected. In early May, when organizing trade unions in various industries and private factories, these experiences from the organization of trade unions in state-owned factories were adopted, and the method of representative meetings was adopted and used from the beginning of the organization of trade unions, and it was combined with the signing of collective contracts on an industry-by-industry basis to carry out the organization.
    3.  In the early stages of trade union work and even later, destructive elements infiltrated the trade union organization in the process of establishing some trade unions, affecting the purity and prestige of the trade union organization. Therefore, vigilance must be heightened, and counter-revolutionaries, destructive elements, and scabs within the trade union organization must be eliminated at any time. At the same time, class education for trade union cadres and members must be strengthened, especially class education for industry trade union cadres and members is even more important.
    4.  After overcoming the tendency of closed-doorism, the work content failed to be enriched, forming a phenomenon in which only a few trade union committee members or cadres who were detached from production were busy, while ordinary members had nothing to do. Therefore, the current focus of organizational work, whether in state-owned or private enterprises or industry trade unions, is how to cultivate and improve the ability of the backbone, strengthen the connection between the backbone and the masses, improve the life of the group, and promote everyone to run the trade union, so that the trade union group becomes the grassroots organization for completing the tasks of the trade union, in order to quickly overcome the formalism that is currently quite common in trade unions.
    Propaganda Work is Carried Out from Four Aspects: Education, Propaganda, Cultural Activities, and Staff Training Classes
    The propaganda and education work over the past year has been carried out from four aspects: education, propaganda, cultural activities, and staff training classes.
    1.  Education Work: According to the latest survey, 43.2% of the workers who have been organized in the city have participated in workers' night schools, workers' study groups, literacy classes, or study groups. The city's more formal and large-scale workers' education work began with summer education with the assistance of the Municipal Education Bureau, the Municipal Youth Committee, and the Municipal Women's Federation. A total of more than 12,000 workers participated in summer study. They mainly studied high, middle, and elementary three kinds of cultural textbooks and "Labor Creates the World" and "Basic Problems of the Chinese Revolution" two kinds of political textbooks. The workers who participated in summer study generally had a preliminary correct understanding of the people's democratic dictatorship, and their class consciousness was generally improved. In order to eliminate narrow nationalism among workers and to welcome the Asian-Australian Trade Union Representative Conference to be held in Beijing, internationalism education was universally carried out among workers in the city from the end of August. In the future, workers' education work will enter a regularized long-term education stage on the above basis.
    In addition, the problem of school enrollment for workers' out-of-school children was initially resolved. In order to solve the problem of enrollment for workers' children, the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions Preparatory Committee and the Municipal Education Bureau successively recruited students three times in municipal primary and secondary schools. A total of 73 classes were added to municipal primary schools and 18 classes to municipal secondary schools. It is estimated that 4,650 workers' children of primary school level and 932 workers' children of secondary school level were enrolled.
    The main shortcomings of education work over the past year are that it has not been able to improve with the improvement of workers' awareness since October last year.
    2.  Propaganda Work: The main content is to focus on the goal of restoring and developing production, and to give play to the enthusiasm and creativity of the working class in production and construction. In addition to the two issues of "Labor Movement Documents" and five issues of "Beijing Labor Movement" published by the Propaganda and Education Department of the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, there are 16 kinds of small printed and mimeographed newspapers run by workers themselves in various state-owned enterprises, factories, and industries, according to incomplete statistics (excluding the railway system). Each issue can distribute more than 8,000 copies, and there are more than 600 editors, reporters, publishers, and distributors participating in the work, all of whom are employees.
    In addition, during the "February 7th," "May 1st," "July 7th," "Supporting World Peace," and "Celebrating the Founding of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China" conferences, workers organized propaganda teams, singing teams, and propaganda trucks to carry out large-scale street parade propaganda. From October 1st to 3rd alone, workers organized more than 50 propaganda teams and 19 propaganda trucks, with more than 4,000 participants.
    3.  Cultural Entertainment: Because Beijing workers did not have proper cultural entertainment life before liberation, the demand for cultural entertainment life is particularly urgent after liberation. A workers' amateur cultural entertainment training class was held on March 25, and another workers' amateur music training class was held on August 23, cultivating cultural entertainment talents among employees. There are now 19 singing teams organized by workers themselves, with more than 900 participants, more than 20 yangko teams, with more than 1,000 participants. There are 20 drama troupes, with more than 1,000 participants. Two joint performances by workers have been held, and workers have created many scripts and songs themselves. In addition, various art troupes and film teams have been organized to tour industrial areas in urban and suburban areas and various factories in the city for more than 100 performances for workers, with more than 300,000 audiences. In terms of club work, the 70th Arsenal, Renli Carpet Company, Qinghe Woolen Mill, Shijingshan Power Plant, and Steel Plant have all been formally organized.
    4.  Staff Training Classes: Two sessions have been held, and the third session is currently in progress, with a total of 1,100 students. Two temporary short-term training classes have been held with a total of 250 students. The purpose of the training class is to cultivate activists among the staff of each factory to become the backbone of production and trade union work in each factory. The study time is one to two months.
    The staff who participated in the training class and returned to the factory can take the lead in both production and trade union work and mobilize the workers to work hard to complete the production tasks. For example, after Liu Taichen, a miner from Mentougou, studied, he rescued explosives and other equipment at the risk of danger when the mine caught fire, and helped the mine police to put out the fire.
    The main experiences of propaganda and education work over the past year: 1. Propaganda and education work must be closely centered on the central work carried out by the trade union. 2. General political education should be combined with current policy education. Otherwise, the teacher will use a lot of energy, and the workers will still be bored. For example, the political class in the summer workers' education was divorced from the current actual political life of the workers. 3. Political education and cultural education for workers should be combined with technical education. 4. Cultural and entertainment work: We must have a good grasp so that it does not become formalism, but effectively guide it to "write oneself, write oneself, perform oneself, and perform oneself" mass activities full of educational content that are conducive to production and improve awareness.
  Assist in Taking Over and Inventorying, and Strive to Restore Production
    Beijing workers greeted the liberation with a high degree of revolutionary enthusiasm, and under the leadership and call of the Communist Party, carried out the struggle to protect factories and successfully assisted in the takeover work. During the struggle to protect factories during the siege, many factory workers established secret picket teams and semi-legal factory protection teams and fire brigades to monitor and prevent enemy sabotage before entering the city. Workers at the clothing factory organized to guard the workshops and warehouses; workers at the telecommunications bureau dispersed and preserved valuable equipment. Avoid war and enemy sabotage. After the peaceful liberation of Beijing, workers in various factories quickly organized committees to welcome the Liberation Army. When our army entered the city, tens of thousands of workers automatically collectively welcomed them. In the takeover and inventory of materials, many factory workers earnestly assisted in the inventory. For example, in the process of assisting in the inventory, the workers of the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant found out that the types of off-book items in one branch accounted for 100%, and the quantity reached more than 50%. Workers in factories in the suburbs, such as Changxindian Railway Machinery Factory, Pinghan Railway Administration, Shijingshan Power Plant, and Qinghe Woolen Mill, also launched a movement to dedicate equipment. Hao Junhou and Ma Yulin, workers of the Iron and Steel Plant, automatically got up early to inspect equipment in the wasteland; line workers of the Power Company found scattered equipment along the line. Workers played a major role in starting to restore and develop factories that were closed or semi-closed during the Kuomintang era. Factories with production plans generally can complete their tasks or exceed their plans. In the production movement over the past year, many labor activists and inventors have emerged, showing a new labor attitude of the working class. For example, the workers of the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant shortened the estimated working hours by one-third when repairing the largest blast furnace in North China and the Liulihe Cement Plant completed the 10,000-ton cement plan, and the workers of the Water Plant completed a month's project in 14 days. When the workers of the Beijing Clothing Factory stormed the winter clothing task, the average was 4.5 sets per person per day at the beginning. Finally, with the efforts of the workers, the average reached 7.17 sets per person per day. Due to the active production of workers, the production of rubber shoes and bladders in the private Xinhua Rubber Factory has doubled, and the defective products have been reduced to 0.43% (originally 2.5%). Other factories such as Sanyang Match Factory and Jingwei Weaving and Dyeing Factory have increased their productivity.
    The above facts clearly show that Beijing workers are actively participating in the restoration and development of production with a new labor attitude. However, there are still problems that must be improved: For example, the work of truly discussing production plans and ensuring the completion and striving to exceed production plans, improving production and creating new records, and resolutely overcoming the phenomena of waste and lax labor discipline that still exist in individual factories is still very poor. In addition, vigorously mobilizing workers to run factories well, making rationalization proposals in management, production, and technology, and strengthening unity among employees are also work problems that our trade unions urgently need to solve in the future.
  Labor Protection and Welfare Work Appropriately Guarantees the Life of Employees
    The labor protection and welfare work carried out by the trade union over the past year has appropriately guaranteed the life of employees. Before liberation, although some state-owned and private enterprises had regulations on labor insurance and welfare, some were only formalities, some were only clauses, and most of them could not be realized. In addition, the Kuomintang reactionaries' destruction and destruction of state-owned and private factories and enterprises put factories and enterprises in a state of stagnation or decline, and price fluctuations made it impossible for workers' wages to maintain a minimum standard of living, so labor insurance and welfare were even more out of the question. After liberation, although there were great difficulties, we did some work on labor insurance and welfare. All factories have generally implemented the existing reasonable regulations and made some new welfare facilities, such as the clinics, employee children's schools, safety equipment, and hygiene equipment in 11 state-owned and private factories such as the People's Printing Factory, Telecommunications Bureau, Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant, Shijingshan Power Plant, and Renli Carpet Company. In addition, the contents of labor insurance and welfare have been enriched in the labor-capital collective contracts that have been signed or are being negotiated in private enterprises. Five new clinics have been set up in various districts.
    In particular, the organization of consumer cooperatives in various factories has appropriately guaranteed the lives of workers, avoided being affected by price fluctuations, and enabled workers to work in peace. As of the end of September, 57 cooperatives had been established in state-owned and private factories in the city, with 210,075 members and 743,645 catties of millet in shares. There are a total of 788 cooperative cadres. In addition, 46 transportation workers' cooperatives were established, with a total of 54,215 shares, 60,975 members, and 225 cadres.
    Due to the existence of employee cooperatives, a large amount of intermediate exploitation has been reduced, and speculation by unscrupulous merchants has been cracked down on. For example, the clothing factory cooperative avoided intermediate exploitation by merchants equivalent to 516,735 catties of millet from March to August. In Mentougou, unscrupulous merchants specialized in speculation during the Kuomintang era. Whatever the workers were paid, it was particularly cheap, but the things that the workers needed were particularly expensive. Now that the workers' necessities are supplied by the cooperative, the opportunity for unscrupulous merchants to speculate has also decreased.
    The experiences and lessons learned from this work are:
    1.  Cooperatives must be made into economic organizations of the masses themselves, and the extent of mass participation is the basic key to determining the quality of the cooperative. The Qinghe Woolen Mill employee cooperative was almost collapsed due to administrative monopoly in the initial stage, but after reorganization by mass elections, it embarked on a new path. The mass base of general cooperatives is not enough. Among the 57 employee cooperatives, only 21 have produced representative meetings and cooperative committees. Generally, member education is also very insufficient. For example, some members of the Telecommunications Bureau believe that they should buy things at the cooperatives run by the public because they earn public money, and some members of the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant cooperative join the shares when prices fall and withdraw the shares when prices rise to profit from it, which affects the cooperative affairs.
    2.  The leadership should closely cooperate. The Municipal Cooperative Federation, the Federation of Trade Unions, and the administration should have a clear division of labor and be jointly responsible. The trade union is mainly responsible for organizing, educating, enlightening, promoting, and supervising work. The Municipal Cooperative Federation is mainly responsible for business guidance. The administration should provide appropriate economic and material assistance so that the cooperative can be run well.
    3.  The conditions of cooperative cadres are very important, especially the leading cadres. For example, the director of the Three-Wheeler Workers' Cooperative in Shijie, Third District, and the cadres of the Water Company Cooperative are very enthusiastic to serve the members, listen to the members' opinions, and improve them at any time, so the work is better.
    4.  Attention must be paid to improving business management. At present, the following shortcomings are generally existed in the business management of various societies: the turnover rate of funds is too low; the loss is too large; the accounting system is unsound; the statistics and economic accounting work is poor, etc. In the future, we should discuss solutions with relevant departments and the masses to improve.
  Several Experiences in the Democratization of Factory Management
    The work of democratization of factory management started in early May. Up to now, eight units including the Telecommunications Bureau and the Water Company have established management committees in state-owned enterprises and factories. Generally, it has played a certain role in improving and strengthening the relationship between the Party, the government, and the trade union, increasing workers' sense of ownership, and improving production enthusiasm and creativity. Among them, the Telecommunications Bureau is better. However, due to lack of experience, lack of full ideological preparation, especially the administrative cadres have many concerns in ideology, coupled with the method of adopting simultaneous progress and completing the task universally within a time limit, it is not easy to deepen the work and fall into a passive position. Even the factories that have established management committees have fallen into stagnation.
    After research and summary, in mid-June, it was proposed that the work of democratization of management must be combined with criticism and self-criticism, so that workers can give play to their initiative and creativity in democratic life. At the same time, the working method should be changed, and efforts should be concentrated to focus on the tram company and the People's Printing Factory to carry out the work, so as to absorb experience and promote the development of all the work.
    The preliminary experiences gained now are:
    1.  There must be full ideological preparation. First of all, the Party, the government, and the trade union must have a unified understanding of the work of democratization of management, so that they can concentrate their efforts and carry out the work under a unified goal. Especially whether the administrative side can actively and responsibly solve problems is the key to the success or failure of the work of democratization of management.
    2.  It is necessary to combine the solutions with the reasonable and possible demands of the workers related to production, so that the workers can experience from concrete facts that they are really the masters of the house and understand the important role of the democratization of management.
    3.  It is necessary to adopt the working method of concentrating efforts to break through one point, so as to absorb experience from point to surface, from partial to overall, and develop step by step. The method of universally starting and universally developing at once cannot be adopted, because that will make the work generalized or stop at general calls and cannot be deepened.
    4.  It is necessary to be good at using the employee representative meeting to collect mass opinions in a timely manner and persist in it, so that the leadership's intentions are combined with the mass's demands. Attention should be paid to the following when convening the employee representative meeting: (1) A full investigation and research must be conducted in advance on the situation in the factory, such as history, personnel, mass awareness and demands, and possible problems. (2) Representatives should be elected cautiously, and more upright workers who can really do things for the masses and have prestige among the masses should be selected, and avoid or select fewer gunners who only talk and do nothing and good old people who have no ability, and strictly prevent special agents from posing as representatives. (3) The leadership should actively put forward the problems that urgently need to be solved in the current production and solve them concretely, so as to better promote the development of production. (4) Mass opinions should be handled separately according to the situation. Those that are right should be accepted, and those that are wrong should be patiently persuaded. Do not blindly accept all criticisms. For the sabotage activities of a few destructive elements and special agents, appropriate blows should be given to support the righteousness and suppress the evil. (5) Solving problems should be based on facts. Those that are necessary and possible should be actively solved. Those that are necessary but cannot be done at present and those that are unnecessary or impossible should be postponed or not done, and the reasons should be explained to the masses. (6) After the representative meeting is convened, the representatives should be organized to convey to the masses in a planned way.
    5.  After the employee representative meeting is closed, a factory management committee should be established quickly so as to maintain close contact with the masses and persist in and develop the work of democratization of management.
  Experiences and Lessons Learned in Resolving Labor-Capital Disputes and Concluding Collective Contracts
    Workers in various industries in Beijing have been forced to endure various excessive oppressions and exploitations by the capitalists for a long time, and the social and political status of workers has undergone a fundamental change after liberation. Due to this reason, the workers' emotions of resisting the capitalists are very high, and they have put forward many demands, most of which are reasonable and should be. However, some have exceeded the limits of mutual benefit between labor and capital. At this time, the capitalists do not understand the policy enough; some are afraid of fighting because they have a guilty conscience, and they agree to the workers' demands; some automatically increase wages and improve the lives of workers in order to ease the workers' struggle against themselves. Some have a negative attitude towards business and transfer funds secretly. Some labor and capital parties hold different opinions, forming sharp opposition, and the capitalists feel very uneasy. At that time, because the Labor Bureau had not yet been established, labor-capital disputes could not be resolved in a centralized and unified manner at the municipal level. Each street and district handled labor-capital disputes on its own. For example, the same conditions cannot be resolved with the same standards, and the differences are huge, which affects each other, so the more disputes are handled, the more disputes there are. At the end of April, due to the instructions of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions and the Municipal Party Committee: The Municipal Federation of Trade Unions and the Municipal Labor Bureau will resolve the disputes in a unified manner. The Municipal Party Committee, the Municipal Federation of Industry and Commerce, and the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions Preparatory Committee convened several meetings of representatives of workers and capitalists in various industries at this time, explained the policies, listened to opinions, and explained the practices. Then, the method of concluding collective contracts in various industries was adopted to handle labor-capital disputes based on the basic spirit of "developing production and mutual benefit between labor and capital" to establish correct labor-capital relations. This stabilized the emotions of both labor and capital parties at that time, especially the emotions of the capitalists, but some capitalists still had some unnecessary concerns because they did not read newspapers or study policies.
    At that time, because the labor-capital disputes in the national medicine industry were more serious, the conclusion of the collective contract in the national medicine industry was first started.
    After more than a month of brewing, discussion, drafting, agreement, and final revision between labor and capital parties, the collective contract of the Beijing National Medicine Industry was first signed and promulgated with the approval of the Labor Bureau. This is the appearance of the first labor-capital collective contract in Beijing (in which the traditional unreasonable wage commission method of the industry is temporarily maintained). Subsequently, in addition to the national medicine industry, the collective contracts that have been signed and approved by the Labor Bureau in Beijing include the construction industry, weaving and dyeing industry, manure industry, and flour industry; those that have been drafted and are still being negotiated include: oil can industry, sewing and Western clothing industry, shoe industry, oil, salt, and grain industry, dyeing industry, bathhouse industry, match industry, iron industry, and carpet industry.
    The steps for concluding the contract are: First, the trade union or preparatory committee of the industry selects employee representatives from the workers, and the employee representatives collect the opinions of the employees of the industry on concluding the collective contract, formulate the labor collective contract plan, print it and distribute it to the employee groups for extensive discussion, put forward opinions, and then collect it for modification and supplement. Finally, the representative meeting is passed to put forward the labor's opinion. At the same time, under the leadership and supervision of the Labor Bureau, the industry chamber of commerce selects the capitalist representatives, collects the opinions of the capitalists of the industry on concluding the collective contract, formulates the capitalist's plan, and puts forward the capitalist's opinion after the members' meeting is passed, that is, officially conduct negotiations, convene a joint meeting of labor-capital representatives, conduct discussions, launch debates, repeatedly negotiate, and finally draft the unanimous opinions of both parties into a collective contract. Finally, the representatives of both labor and capital parties send the agreed draft collective contract to the members of both labor and capital parties to solicit opinions. Until the vast majority of both parties are satisfied, the representatives of both parties sign the contract and it is promulgated and implemented with the approval of the Labor Bureau.
    The experiences gained in the work of concluding collective contracts are:
    1.  We must let go of mobilizing the masses and avoid taking over everything. Here, we should not be afraid of some left-leaning demands of the workers; nor should we be afraid of the resistance of a few capitalists. As long as we explain the policies, mobilize and encourage everyone to fully express their opinions, and let everyone criticize and correct each other in the process of discussing the draft contract by the workers' representatives or representative meetings, and in the labor-capital negotiation meetings, this is of great mass self-education significance for improving the awareness of the working class, correcting some over-left demands, changing backward ideas, and breaking the stubbornness of a few capitalists.
    2.  When labor-capital disputes in various industries are chaotic, the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions should cooperate with the Labor Bureau to announce that various industries should resolve the disputes between labor and capital by concluding collective contracts. And it is announced that all contracts must be approved by the Labor Bureau to be effective, so that the goals of both labor and capital parties will quickly turn to discussing collective contracts, and the chaotic phenomenon will soon stop developing.
    However, we took many detours in the early stage due to lack of experience, mainly because we did not dare to let go, and some of them took over everything. And the failure to deal with the behavior of a few capitalists (such as the weaving and dyeing industry) who deliberately created incidents to delay the signing of the contract made the workers dissatisfied.
    3.  The collective contract has considerable contractility, so that some shops and factories can formulate more specific "supplementary contracts" or "implementation rules" according to the spirit of the collective contract and the specific conditions of each factory and shop. The collective contract should solve the problems of the industry on the one hand, and also take into account the impact on other industries or state-owned and private enterprises, otherwise it will cause adverse consequences, such as the brick kiln industry.
    4.  The experience of concluding contracts in the past few months has proved that in addition to concluding comprehensive collective contracts, in order to meet the urgent need of labor and capital parties to solve one or several major disputes, a temporary agreement contract on one or several items in the labor-capital dispute can be concluded. Industries such as manure industry, construction industry, and brick kiln industry have done this, and the workers are very satisfied (the capitalists are also satisfied).
    5.  The conclusion of collective contracts should be closely combined with the establishment and improvement of trade unions. Some industries that have established trade unions should improve the trade union work in the process of concluding contracts. In industries where trade unions have not been established, the opportunity to conclude collective contracts should be used to establish trade unions. In many industries, as long as the conclusion of collective contracts is mentioned, the workers are very willing to establish trade unions first.
    6.  Labor-capital consultation meetings are the most important link. We must help the workers make full preparations, but we must avoid taking over everything. The key points are: (1) The workers have a low level of education and have not been organized for a long time. They are far inferior to the capitalists in formulating clauses and making detailed plans. Therefore, the initial draft of the collective contract drafted by the workers' representatives must be studied clause by clause to avoid loopholes that are unfavorable to the workers. (2) In the process of the meeting, the opinions of labor and capital parties often persist due to a certain problem and fall into a deadlock. Therefore, a temporary adjournment should be proposed in a timely manner, and the representatives of both parties should discuss on their own in order to study further solutions, so that the problem can take a sharp turn for the worse and get a satisfactory solution. Some problems that cannot be agreed upon for a while, but each party insists on, can be temporarily reserved, so that the problems that have been agreed upon are separated from the problems that have not been agreed upon, and the problems become clearer and clearer, and fewer and fewer are solved, until all agreements are reached in the end. (3) The excessive and high demands put forward by the workers will naturally be corrected in the negotiations, but the workers must always be vigilant about some places that are unfavorable to the workers or that the workers cannot realize. For example, individual capitalists calculated the cost very high (such as the capitalists in the weaving and dyeing industry set the minimum wage amount higher, so that outsiders thought the wages were very high, but they set the minimum number of pieces to be delivered even higher, and the general technical level of the workers could not reach it at all). Some capitalists in the flour industry pushed the responsibility of not increasing wages to the "Federation of Trade Unions" and did not allow wage increases in order to provoke the workers' dissatisfaction with the Federation of Trade Unions, etc. We should educate and remind the workers in a timely manner to expose the capitalists' improper intentions, or the trade union cadres should stand on the workers' position and supplement the exposure, otherwise it will not be possible to reach an agreement, or the agreement reached will be unfavorable to the workers. This is the main experience we have gained in concluding collective contracts.

    一年来的工会组织工作在团结组织与教育全体工人，提高工人觉悟，恢复与发展生产的总方针下进行，根据十二月份的统计，已建立公营产业、私营产业、手工业、店员、搬运工人、文教工作者、报馆等全市性及行业的正式工会八十五个，筹备会二十一个，教育工作者工会尚为筹备会，其中大学成立正式工会十二个，筹备会七个。中学正式工会六十四个，筹备会二十六个。小学按区成立正式工会九个，筹备会三个，共计会员一十八万六千一百五十八人，占全体三十九万零六百零五人的百分之四十七·七。
    就培养和提拔工会干部来说：现有各级工会干部、正副主席四百七十名，委员二千三百四十二名，干事四千六百零一名，小组长一万零一百一十五人，提拔到市总工会与各区办事处工作三十七名，提拔培养的工会小组长以上的干部共计为一万七千五百六十五人。提拔到其他部门如工厂管理、政权、其他人民团体、工厂支部、合作社、京市公安队共七千七百九十一名。
    女工会员三千九百九十人，占全体女工四千八百八十七人的百分之八十一。女工参加各训练班和学习班的共有四千二百余人，占全体女工的百分之九十。在生产与学习中，培养提拔了女工干部八百五十六名。
    一年来组织工作的主要经验教训是：
    一、解放初期派往各厂的工作组，在发动工人，保卫工厂，肃清反革命分子，协助接管，恢复生产，教育工人，提高工人觉悟，解决工人部分生活福利问题上是起了不小作用的。因此工作组在工作的开始是有效的和必要的组织形式，但当工会正式成立后，工作组如不撤消，将会妨碍工会工作的发展和健全。过去有的工厂工作组没有及时撤消，使工会工作发展上受到障碍，到四月以后才基本上得到克服。
    二、解放初期的组织工作，曾有过关门主义倾向，四月以后经过几次的检查，才把此种关门主义倾向加以纠正。五月初，在组织各行业及私营工厂工会时，接受了公营工厂工会组织中的这些经验，开始组织工会即采取和运用了代表会议的方式，并与一行一业订立集体合同相结合，进行了组织。
    三、在工会工作初期甚至以后，有的工会在建立过程中破坏分子混入工会组织，影响工会组织的纯洁性和威信，因之必须提高警惕，随时清除工会组织内的反革命分子、破坏分子和工贼，同时必须加强工会干部和会员的阶级教育，特别是行业工会干部和会员的阶级教育更为重要。
    四、在克服了关门主义倾向以后，但因工作内容未能充实，形成只有少数的工会委员或脱离生产的干部忙，一般会员却无事可做的现象。因此当前组织工作的重点不论公私营企业工会或行业工会均是如何培养与提高骨干能力，加强骨干与群众联系，健全小组生活，推动大家办工会，使工会小组成为完成工会任务的基层组织，以求迅速的克服工会目前相当普遍存在着的形式主义现象。
    宣传工作是从教育、宣传、文娱、职工训练班四方面进行的
    一年来的宣教工作，是从教育、宣传、文娱、职工训练班四方面进行的。
    一、教育工作：根据最近的调查，全市已组织起来的工人中已有百分之四十三点二参加了工人夜校、工人学习班、识字班或学习小组等学习。全市比较正规的大规模的工人教育工作，是在市教育局、市青委、市妇联协助下从暑期教育开始。参加暑期学习的工人共一万二千余人。主要学习了高、中、初三种文化课本及“劳动创造世界”，“中国革命基本问题”两种政治课本。参加暑期学习的工人们对人民民主专政一般有了初步的正确认识，阶级觉悟普遍提高了。为消除工人中狭隘民族主义思想，并迎接亚澳职工代表会议在京召开，从八月下旬起，全市工人普遍开展国际主义教育。今后工人教育工作将在上述基础上，步入正规化的长期教育阶段。
    此外，并初步地解决了工人失学子弟入学问题，市总工会筹委会与市教育局为了解决工人子弟入学，先后在市立中小学招了三次生。共在市立小学增设七三个班，市立中学增设十八个班。计解决小学程度工人子弟四六五○人入学，中学程度工人子弟九三二人入学。
    一年来的教育工作的主要缺点是去年十月以后没有能随着工人觉悟程度的提高而提高。
    二、宣传工作：主要内容是围绕着恢复与发展生产这一目标，发挥工人阶级在生产建设上的积极性和创造性。文字出版工作除市总工会宣教部出版过两期“工运文献”，五期“北京工运”外，各公营企业工厂和各行业中，据不完全统计（铁路系统除外），由工人自己办的铅印和油印小报十六种，每期共可发行八千余份，参加工作的编辑、记者、出版、发行的有六百余人，均系职工。
    此外，在“二七”，“五一”，“七七”，“拥护世界和平”，“庆祝中华人民共和国中央人民政府成立”等大会时，工人组织了宣传队、歌咏队、宣传卡车等，大规模的进行了街头游行宣传。仅十月一日至三日工人组织了宣传队五十余队，宣传卡车十九辆，参加人数在四千以上。
    三、文化娱乐：由于解放前北京工人没有正当的文化娱乐生活，所以在解放之后文化娱乐生活的要求特别迫切。三月二十五日举办过一期工人业余文娱训练班，八月二十三日又举办一期工人业余音乐训练班，培养了职工中文娱人才。现工人自己组织的歌咏队有十九个，参加九百余人，秧歌队二十余个，参加千余人。剧团二十个，参加者千余人。举办过两次工人联合演出，工人自己创作了许多剧本和歌曲。此外并组织各文工团、电影队到城郊工业区及城内各工厂为工人巡回演出百余场，观众三十余万。俱乐部工作，现在七十兵工厂、仁立地毯公司、清河制呢厂、石景山发电厂、炼钢厂等都已正式组织起来。
    四、职工训练班：已举办了两期，第三期现正进行中，共计学生一千一百人，临时短训班二期共计学生二百五十人。训练班的目的在于培养各厂职工中的积极分子，成为各工厂生产与工会工作的骨干。学习时间是一个月至两个月。
    参加训练班学习回厂后的职工，不论在生产和工会工作中都能带头并发动工友为完成生产任务而努力，如门头沟矿工刘泰辰学习后，该矿失火时不顾危险，抢救炸药及其他器材，帮助矿警救火等。
    一年来宣教工作中的主要经验：一、宣教工作必须密切围绕着工会进行的中心工作。二、一般的政治教育与当前的政策教育相结合。不然，教者用很大力气，工人还乏味。如暑期工人教育中政治课与当前工人实际政治生活脱节就是一例。三、对工人的政治教育、文化教育，要与技术教育结合。四、文娱工作：我们要很好掌握不使之流于形式主义，而切实引导到有利于生产，提高觉悟的“写自己、自己写、自己演、演自己”的群众性的充满教育内容的活动。
  协助接管清点，努力恢复生产
    北京工人以高度地革命积极性迎接了解放，在共产党的领导与号召下，进行了护厂斗争，胜利的协助了接管工作。在围城时期的护厂斗争中，不少工厂工人自己成立了秘密的纠察队和半合法的护厂队、消防队，进行了入城前的监视和阻止敌人破坏等活动。被服厂工人，有组织的看管了工房、仓库；电信局工人把贵重器材分散保存。避免战争和敌人的破坏。北京和平解放，各厂工人又很快组织了迎接解放军委员会，我军入城时数万工人自动集体欢迎。在接管清点物资中，好多工厂职工认真协助清点，如石景山钢铁厂工人在协助清点中，一个分厂查出的帐外物品种类到百分之百，数量达百分之五十以上。郊外的工厂如长辛店铁路机厂，平汉铁路管理局，石景山发电厂，清河制呢厂等工厂工人还发起了献交器材运动。钢铁厂工人郝俊厚、马玉琳自动起早到荒草地里检器材；电力公司线路工人沿着线路找回散失器材。在使国民党时代停闭或半停业状态的工厂开始恢复和发展，工人起了很大的作用。有生产计划的工厂一般的都能完成任务或超出计划，一年来的生产运动中，涌现了不少的劳动积极分子和创造发明者，显现出工人阶级新的劳动态度。如石景山钢铁厂工人们修复华北最大炼铁炉和琉璃河水泥厂完成万吨水泥计划，都缩短了预计工时三分之一，自来水厂工人用十四天完成了一个月的工程。北京被服厂工人突击冬装任务时，开始平均每人每日四·五套。最后在工人的努力下，平均每人每日达到七·一七套。私营新华橡胶厂胶鞋与球胆的生产，因工人积极生产，产量增加了一倍，废品减少到百分之○·四三（原百分之二·五）。其他如三阳火柴厂，经纬织染厂生产率都有增加。
    以上这些事实显明的看到了北京工人，正以新的劳动态度，积极参加恢复与发展生产的情况。但还有必须改进的问题：如确实讨论生产计划，并保证完成争取超过生产计划，提高生产创造新纪录，和坚决克服个别工厂仍然存在的浪费和劳动纪律的松弛现象等工作做的还很差。又如有力的发动工人办好工厂，在管理生产和技术上进行合理化建议，职工间加强团结，这些也是我们工会工作在今后急需解决的工作问题。
  劳动保护与福利工作适当保证了职工生活
    一年来工会进行的劳动保护与福利工作，适当地保证了职工生活。解放前有些公私营企业虽然有劳保福利的规定，但有的只是形式，有的只是条文，大部分均未能实现，加以国民党反动派对公私营工厂摧残和破坏使工厂企业处于停顿或衰落的状态，物价波动又使工人的工资不能维持最低生活，劳保福利就更谈不到了，在解放后，虽困难很大，但我们对劳保福利曾做了一些工作，各个工厂大体上都已执行了已有的合理规定，并作了一些新的福利设施，如人民印刷厂、电信局、石景山钢铁厂、石景山发电厂、仁立地毯公司等十一个公私营工厂的诊疗所、职工子弟学校、安全设备、卫生设备等。另外在私营已订立或正在协商订立的劳资集体合同上，都充实了劳保福利的内容。各区已新筹设了五个诊疗所。
    特别是各厂消费合作社的组织，适当地保证了工人生活，避免受物价波动的影响，使工人安心生产。全市公私营工厂中的合作社截至九月底共建立五十七个，社员二一○、○七五人，股金小米七四三、六四五斤，合作社干部共有七八八人。此外，并成立搬运工人合作社四十六个，共有五四、二一五股，社员六○、九七五人，干部二二五人。
    由于有了职工合作社，大量减轻了中间剥削，打击了奸商投机。如被服厂合作社从三月份至八月份避免商人中间剥削折合小米五一六、七三五斤。门头沟在国民党时奸商专门投机，工人发什么，什么就特别便宜，但是工人所必需的东西就特别贵。现在工人的必需品由合作社供给，奸商投机的机会也少了。
    这一工作的经验教训是：
    一、必须使合作社成为群众自己的经济组织，群众性的广泛程度是决定合作社好坏的基本关键。清河制呢厂职工合作社，初期由行政包办几乎垮台，后经群众选举改组后，便走上新的道路。一般合作社的群众基础是不够的，五十七个职工合作社当中仅有二十一个产生了代表会与社委会，至于社员教育一般也非常不够，如电信局有些社员认为挣公家的钱便应该到公家办的合作社买东西，石景山钢铁厂合作社有些社员物价落时入股，涨时退股，从中取利，影响了社务。
    二、领导上要密切配合，市合作总社，总工会，行政三方面要分工明确，共同负责，在组织教育启发推动与监督工作方面，主要是工会负责。在业务的指导方面，主要由市合作总社负责。行政上要适当给予经济上和物质上的援助，这样才能把合作社办好。
    三、合作社干部的条件非常重要，尤其是领导干部，如三区十街三轮车工人合作社主任和自来水公司合作社干部，都很热心为社员服务，倾听社员意见，随时改进，因此工作较好。
    四、必须注意与提高业务经营。目前各社在业务经营上还普遍存在着以下缺点：资金周转速率太低；损耗太大；会计制度不健全；统计与经济核算工作差等等。今后应多与有关部门及群众商量办法，以求改进。
  工厂管理民主化工作的几点经验
    工厂管理民主化的工作，是从五月初开始到目前为止，在公营企业与工厂中，有电信局、自来水公司等八个单位成立了管理委员会，一般的在党政工关系的改善与加强、工人的主人翁思想的增长及生产积极性、创造性的提高等各方面起了一定的作用。其中较好的是电信局。但最初由于缺乏经验，缺乏充分思想准备，特别是行政干部在思想上有许多顾虑，加之对工作采取齐头并进，限期普遍完成的方法，致使工作不易深入，陷于被动，甚至已成立了管理委员会的工厂亦陷于停滞状态。
    经过研究总结后，在六月中旬，提出了进行管理民主化工作必须结合批评与自我批评，使工人在民主生活中，发挥积极性与创造性，同时改变工作方式，集中力量，以电车公司和人民印刷厂为重点，开展工作，以便吸取经验，推动全部工作的开展。
    现在获得的几点初步经验是：
    一、要有充分的思想准备，首先党、政、工对管理民主化工作要有一统一的认识，才能在统一目标下，集中力量，进行工作，尤其行政方面的能否积极负责解决问题，是进行管理民主化工作成败的关键。
    二、必须结合解决与生产有关的工人合理的可能办到的要求，使工人由具体事实体验到自己真是当家做主人，了解管理民主化的重大作用。
    三、必须采取集中力量突破一点的工作方式，以吸取经验由点而面，由局部而全体，步步发展，不能采用普遍动手一下子普遍开展的方法，因为那会使工作一般化，或停止在一般的号召上，不能深入。
    四、必须善于运用职工代表会，及时集中群众意见，坚持下去，使领导意图与群众要求相结合，在召开职工代表会时，应注意：（一）对厂内情况如历史、人事、群众觉悟与要求及可能发生的问题，必须事先进行充分调查研究。（二）慎重的选举代表，要多选真正能为群众办事，在群众中有威望的正派工人，避免或少选光说不做的炮手，和没有能力的老好人，严防特务分子混充代表。（三）领导上主动的提出当前生产上急待解决的问题，具体解决，以便更好的推动生产的向前发展。（四）对于群众意见应按情况分别处理。对的接受，不对的耐心说服，不要盲目的接受所有的批评，对于少数破坏分子和特务分子的捣乱行为，应适当的给予打击，以扶植正气，压倒邪气。（五）解决问题要实事求是，凡必要而又可能办到的，就主动的解决，对必要的但目前还不能办到的，和不必要的或不可能的就缓办或不办，并向群众讲清理由。（六）代表会召开后，有计划的组织代表向群众传达。
    五、在职工代表会闭幕后，应迅速成立工厂管理委员会，以便经常密切联系群众，坚持和发展管理民主化的工作。
  解决劳资争议订立集体合同及其经验教训
    北京市的各行业工人，曾经长期被迫忍受资方的种种过分压迫和剥削，而解放后工人的社会地位，政治地位都起了一个根本的变化，由于这种原因，工人起来反抗资方的情绪非常高涨，提出了许多要求，其中大多是合理的，应该的；但也有些超过了劳资两利限度，资方在这时对政策是了解不够的；有的因为亏心，怕斗争，工人有要求即答应；有的自动的给工人增加工资，改善工人生活，以求缓和工人对自己的斗争。有的对营业抱消极态度，暗地转移资金，有的劳资双方争持不下，形成尖锐的对立，资方大感不安。当时因劳动局尚未成立，劳资纠纷未能由市一级集中统一解决。各街各区各自为政的处理劳资纠纷，例如同一条件情况，不能以同一标准解决，参差悬殊，此起彼落，相互影响，故而愈处理则纠纷愈多。四月底，由于全总及市委的指示：统一由市总工会和市劳动局解决。市委，市工商局，市总工会筹委会在这时分别召集了多次各行业职工代表会和资方座谈会，在这些会议上讲解政策，听取意见，说明做法，随即采取了各行业订立集体合同的办法，本“发展生产，劳资两利”的基本精神，处理劳资争议，来建立正确的劳资关系。这样使当时的劳资双方的情绪，特别是资方的情绪稳定了很多，但仍有一部分资本家因不看报纸，不研究政策，而存有一些不必要的顾虑。
    当时因国药业纠纷较严重，于是首先着手订立国药业的集体合同。
    经过了一个多月劳资双方的酝酿，讨论，起草，协议和最后修正，北京市国药业集体合同首先签字，并经劳动局批准公布，这就是北京市第一个劳资集体合同的出现（其中暂时仍保持了该业传统的不合理的工资提成法）。随之北京市已订立并经劳动局批准的集体合同除国药业外，有建筑业，织染业，粪业，面粉业；已经起草尚在商订中的有：油篓业，缝纫、西服业，鞋业，油盐粮业，染业，浴堂业，火柴业，铁工业，地毯业等。
    订立合同的步骤是，先由该行业工会或筹委会从工人中选出职工代表，由职工代表搜集该行职工对订立集体合同的意见，拟定劳方集体合同方案，印发给职工小组广泛进行讨论，提出意见，再收集上来修改补充，最后由代表会通过提出劳方的意见，同时资方由劳动局领导与督促，该行业同业公会选出资方代表，搜集该行资方对订立集体合同的意见，拟定资方方案，经会员大会通过后，提出资方的意见即正式进行谈判，召集劳资代表联席会议，进行讨论，展开争论，反复磋商，最后将双方一致的意见，起草为集体合同。最后再由劳资双方代表把商定的集体合同草案，发给劳资双方的会员征求意见，直到双方绝大多数满意后，即由双方代表签字，经劳动局批准公布实行。
    在订立集体合同工作上获得的经验是：
    一、必须放手发动群众，切忌包办代替。在这里既不要怕工人中某些左的要求；也不要怕少数资方的抵抗。只要我们在工人代表或代表大会讨论合同草案的过程中，以及在劳资谈判的会议上讲明政策，发动并鼓励大家充分发表意见，让大家互相批评，互相纠正，这对工人阶级觉悟的提高及纠正某些过左的要求，和改变落后的思想及打破少数资方的顽固性，是有很大的群众自我教育的作用的。
    二、当各行业劳资纠纷正混乱的时候，由市总协同劳动局宣布：各行业要从订立集体合同来解决劳资间的争议。并宣布：一切合同须经劳动局批准方为有效，这样劳资双方的目标，即很快转向商讨集体合同，混乱现象很快就会停止发展。
    但我们在开始时期因缺乏经验，走了不少弯路，主要是不敢放手，部分的带有包办代替，以及对个别行业中（如织染业）少数资方，故意节外生枝拖延合同签订的时间的行为缺乏适时的处理曾使工人不满。
    三、集体合同有相当的收缩性，以使某些店铺与工厂作坊，再根据集体合同的精神及各厂各号的具体情况，订立更具体的“补充合同”或“执行细则”。集体合同一面要解决本行业的问题，同时也要照顾到对于其他行业或公私营企业的影响，否则就会引起不良的后果，如砖窑业就是这样。
    四、几个月来订立合同的经验证明：除了订全面的集体合同外，为了适应劳资双方间急待解决的一个或几个主要争议问题起见，可订立劳资争议中之一项或几项的临时协议合同，如粪业、建筑业、砖窑业等都曾这样做过，工人都很满意（资方也满意）。
    五、订立集体合同与建立和健全工会应紧紧的相结合，有些已成立工会的行业应在订立合同过程中将工会工作健全起来，在未成立工会的行业中则是用订立集体合同的机会将工会建立起来，许多行业只要一提起订立集体合同，工人都很愿先成立工会。
    六、劳资协商会议，是最重要的一环，我们一定要很好的帮助工人作充分的准备工作但要避免包办，其要者有：（一）工人的文化水平低，且组织起来还不久，在拟定条文以及精密计划上远不如资方。因此，对工人代表拟出的集体合同初稿，必须帮助逐条逐字研究，免出漏洞不利工人。（二）在会谈的过程中，常常因了某一个问题，劳资双方意见坚持不下，陷入僵局，因而适时的提出暂时休会，双方代表自行商议，以便研究进一步的解决办法，使问题急转直下，得到满意的解决，对一些一时得不到协议，而又各自坚持的问题可暂时保留，这样使已得协议的与未得协议的问题分开，问题就愈弄愈清，愈解决愈少，直到最后全部达成协议。（三）对工人提出的过左过高的要求，在谈判中自然也会纠正过来，但对一些与工人不利的或工人体会不到的地方，必须时刻提高工人的警惕。如个别资本家将成本计算打得很高（如织染业中资本家将起码工资数目订得较高，使外人看来工资很高，但却把起码交货匹数订得更高，工人一般技术水平根本达不到），面粉业一些资本家将不给工人增加工资的责任推到“总工会”不让增资以挑拨工人对总工会的不满等。这些我们都应该及时教育与提醒工人对资方此种不正当的意图加以揭露或者工会干部站在工人立场加以补充揭发，不然就不可能获得协议，或获得的协议是对工人不利的。这便是我们订立集体合同中所得到的主要经验。
