　　Four Soviet Local Newspaper Editors
    Letters to the Editorial Department of Pravda (Excerpts)
    I. Rural Correspondents Are Our Backbone
    Twenty to thirty rural correspondents and visitors come to us every day.
    The postman comes three times a day, and rural correspondents often call us with news. All interesting news has been published in the newspaper.
    The authors who send letters to the editorial department often exchange experiences with each other, discuss shortcomings, and criticize careless staff. Each correspondent has only one Bolshevik will—to reach the highest standards and strive for first place in the socialist competition. And to strive for first place and an important position requires the determination to fulfill the tasks sworn to Comrade Stalin.
    Rural correspondents are our backbone. The editorial department systematically holds local and group meetings of rural correspondents and issues letters of "help for the blackboard newspaper editing team."
    The local party committee and the party secretary lead the newspaper and often help the editorial department. At our request, the district committee discussed the role of newspaper materials. The district committee invited many responsible cadres who had not responded to letters and proposals from the working masses to attend the meeting. They were warned. Now the editorial department no longer needs to remind the other party and can receive answers to criticisms.
    The Kiev All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) State Committee gave us great help. The State Committee often writes us letters and commentaries. This year, the State Committee held a seminar for secretaries and instructors of local newspaper editorial departments. (Ivan Yezhili, Editor of the Spoliansk District Local Newspaper in Kiev Oblast)
    II. Tirelessly Learning
    Life in every corner of our district is bustling. The local newspaper "Bolshevik" is working hard to describe the labor creations of the Soviet people more perfectly. We want to make every word in the newspaper understood by readers and inspire their thoughts, and improve their political and productive enthusiasm.
    Many contents are suggested to us by readers. Chigrinov, the chairman of the collective farm named after Kalinin, told the editorial department that the Vasiliev family of collective farmers worked very hard and received considerable income. Comrade Chigrinov requested that these loyal workers be written about in the best language.
    After studying the Vasiliev family's budget, income, and expenses, the editorial department wrote an interesting article entitled "The Annual Income of the Vasiliev Family of Collective Farmers." Readers can see at a glance how the Soviet peasants have taken a step forward. The collective farmers who love labor live richly and civilly.
    The editorial department holds monthly meetings of rural author activists to listen to opinions and readers' suggestions and information.
    The party district committee and the district committee secretary often help the newspaper. We consider the fact that party member activists rarely participate in the newspaper to be the biggest shortcoming.
    Our party is carrying out large-scale ideological and educational work. Therefore, the responsibility of local newspapers has also increased, and the ideological and political level of the newspaper must be improved. Our newspaper staff must tirelessly grasp the theory of Marxism-Leninism, learn the art of Bolshevik political commentators, learn from old and new cadres, and learn in life, in order to truly complete these tasks. (Qituofu, Editor of the "Bolshevik" Newspaper in the Bigaoli District of Volonezh Oblast)
    III. Support the Initiatives of the Workers
    The newspaper pays close attention to the socialist competition carried out by three-person groups, ten-person groups, and among collective farms. Many articles have been published in the newspaper.
    The editorial department, together with the inspection office, checked the work of the organs and the letters and complaints of the workers.
    Unfortunately, the Party District Committee does not highly value the role of the newspaper. Whenever the editor is sent to any village as a plenipotentiary representative, the staff of the District Committee bless him with words like these:
    ——Think about it! The newspaper is just a small piece of paper. This work is enough for two people to do in two hours, but what about you? It takes a week, and you still have to be careful...
    District Committee staff rarely write articles for us.
    The editorial department rarely receives answers to the letters of the workers. The District Committee also does not strictly require the leaders of factories and organs to answer the warnings raised in the newspaper in a timely manner.
    Recently, a series of critical articles have been published in the newspaper, but the District Committee has never discussed them.
    The Propaganda Department of the Vladimir Oblast All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) State Committee rarely helps us. When we proposed that collective farms should be economical, the State Committee did not support the newspaper.
    We are most pleased that readers are very interested in local newspapers. The newspaper has a circulation of 3,600 copies, all of which are subscribers. This proves that the newspaper has prestige among the workers. (Nuowoxielisiji, Editor of the "Collective Farm Voice" Newspaper in the Yuriev-Polisky District of Vladimir Oblast)
    IV. The Editorial Department Should Consult with Advanced People
    The editorial department of our newspaper often talks to outstanding people and activists in the district.
    The editorial department organized a team of collective farm members to investigate advanced collective farms in the district in order to study and disseminate experience. This kind of investigation often ends with a lively discussion. The summaries of the investigation are published in the newspaper.
    In the spring, a group of collective farm members and agricultural technicians in the district organized an investigation team to the sandy area of Voronezh Oblast at the suggestion of the newspaper.
    Conversations with progressive masses and the close contact between the editorial department and readers have increased the number of regular contributors, and the number of readers' letters in the newspaper has also increased.
    The life of the party occupies the most important position in the newspaper. Party topics are written by the Party District Committee Secretary, section chiefs, instructors of the District Committee, party branch secretaries, and dozens of propagandists and ordinary communists.
    The District Committee leads the newspaper and supports its initiatives. The District Committee Secretary suggests some new topics to me. (Suluofu Ruofu, Editor of the "Road to Socialism" Newspaper in the Baitiane District of Liangzanski Oblast)

### 四个苏联地方报纸编辑  写给真理报编辑部的信（摘录）

　　四个苏联地方报纸编辑
    写给真理报编辑部的信（摘录）
    一、农村通讯员是我们的支柱
    每天有二十至三十个农村通讯员和访问者来到我们这里。
    邮差每天来三次，农村通讯员常常打电话告诉我们消息。所有有意思的新闻都已见报。
    给编辑部寄信的作者彼此经常交换经验，谈论缺点，批评粗心的工作人员。每个通讯员只有一个布尔什维克的意志——达到最高标准，在社会主义竞赛中争取第一位。而要争取第一位和重要地位就要有完成向斯大林同志誓言过的任务的决心。
    农村通讯员是我们的支柱。编辑部有系统地召开了农村通讯员的地方和小组会议，发出“帮助黑板报编辑小组”的信。
    党的地方委员会与党书记领导报纸，经常地帮助编辑部。根据我们的请求，区委会讨论了关于报纸材料的作用的问题。区委会把许多对劳动群众的信和提议没有答复的负责干部都请来参加了会议。向他们提出了警告。现在编辑部不需要再提醒对方，就可以收到对批评的答复了。
    基辅联共党（布）州委会给了我们很大的帮助。州委会常给我们写信和述评。今年州委会举行了书记与地方报纸编辑部指导员的研究会。（基辅州斯波亮斯克区地方报纸编辑依万·耶日里）
    二、不倦地学习
    我们区的每个角落里的生活都是热腾腾的。地方报纸“布尔什维克”在努力更完善地描述苏维埃人民的劳动创造。我们想使报纸的每句话都能为读者所了解并能启发他们的思想，提高他们的政治与生产的积极性。
    许多内容都是读者暗示我们的。名为加里宁的集体农庄的主席奇格里诺夫告诉编辑部说，集体农庄庄员华西里耶夫的一家很努力劳动，并得到了可观的收入。奇格里诺夫同志要求以最好的语言来写这些忠实的劳动者。
    研究了华西里耶夫的家庭预算，收入及开支以后，编辑部写了一篇以《集体农庄庄员华西里耶夫一家的年终收入》为题的有意思的文章。读者一看就知道苏维埃农民是怎样往前迈进了一步。爱好劳动的集体农庄庄员富裕地和文明地生活着。
    编辑部每月召开农村作者积极分子会议，听取意见和读者的建议与情况。
    党的区委员和区委书记经常帮助报纸。我们认为党员积极分子很少参加报纸为最大的缺点。
    我党在进行着大规模的思想教育工作。因而地方报纸的责任也增大了，必须提高报纸的思想政治水平。我们报纸工作人员必须不倦地掌握马列主义的理论，要学习布尔什维克政论家的艺术，向老的和新的干部学习，在生活中学习，以便确实地完成这些任务。（窝洛聂沙州白高里区《布尔什维克》报编辑齐托夫）
    三、支持劳动者的倡议
    报纸很注意三人小组，十人小组及集体农庄间所进行的社会主义竞赛。报纸上登载了许多文章。
    编辑部与检查所一同检查了机关工作和劳动者的来信与不满。
    可惜党的区委会对报纸的作用估价不高。每当把编辑当作全权代表派赴任何一个村庄时，区委会的工作人员就用这样一些话来祝福他说：
    ——想想吧！报纸不过一张小纸片。这个工作两个人做两个钟头已经够了，而你们呢？一搞就是一个礼拜，还要小心翼翼……
    区委会工作人员很少给我们写稿子。
    编辑部很少收到回答劳动者的信。区委会也不严格要求各工厂和机关的领导者及时回答报纸上所提出的警告。
    近来报上登载了一系列的批评文章，然而区委会从来也没有讨论过。
    弗拉基米尔斯基州联共党（布）州委会的宣传鼓动部很少帮助我们。当我们提出在集体农庄里应该节约和经济的时候，州委会并不支持报纸。
    我们最高兴的是，读者对地方报纸很感兴趣。报纸发行三千六百份，都是订户。证明报纸在劳动者中是有威信的。（弗拉吉米尔斯基州尤里耶夫·波里斯基区《集体农庄呼声》报编辑诺沃雪里斯基）
    四、编辑部要和先进的人商量
    我们报纸的编辑部经常和本区优秀的人们与积极分子谈话。
    编辑部组织了集体农庄庄员的小组调查队到本区先进的集体农庄以便研究与传播经验。这种调查研究经常是以热烈的讨论会来结束的。关于调查研究的总结都在报上发表。
    春天，本区的一批集体农庄庄员和农业技师，按照报纸的提议组织调查团到沃罗涅斯科州的沙石地区去。
    和进步群众的谈话以及编辑部与读者密切联系的结果，增加了经常的投稿者，报纸上读者的来信也增加了。
    党的生活在报纸上占有最重要的地位。党的课题都是党的区委书记、科长与区委会指导员、党组织书记以及几十个宣传鼓动员与普通共产党员来写的。
    区委会领导报纸并支持它的倡议，区委书记暗示我一些新的课题。（亮赞斯基州白天鹅区《走向社会主义的道路》报编辑苏洛夫若夫）
