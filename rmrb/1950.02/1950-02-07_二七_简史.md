A brief history of the "February 7th" Strike
    Twenty-seven years ago, the Chinese working class, mainly composed of the workers of the Beijing-Hankou Railway, held an unprecedentedly heroic political strike in history—the "February 7th" Strike. The political situation in China at that time can be simply described as follows: the entire North China to the middle reaches of the Yangtze River was largely under the rule of the so-called "Zhili Clique" (Zhili refers to Zhili Province, now Hebei), headed by Cao Kun and Wu Peifu. In the provinces in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River, the Zhili Clique and another "Anhui Clique" (headed by warlords from Anhui Province) military clique led by Duan Qirui ruled. The southwestern provinces were divided and dominated by other large and small warlords relying on the "Zhili" and "Anhui" factions. Sun Yat-sen was active in Guangdong and Guangxi at that time, hoping to use the power of local warlords as a basis to confront the northern warlords. The northeast outside the customs was in the hands of the "Fengtian Clique" (Feng refers to Fengtian, now Liaoning) warlords such as Zhang Zuolin. All these warlords were representatives of large landlords and big bourgeoisie in different regions of China and lackeys of one or several imperialist countries. They were representatives of China's semi-colonial and semi-feudal rule and the fierce enemies of the Chinese people. Among these warlord cliques at that time, the Zhili warlord Wu Peifu held the greatest military power. They occupied the central government, so they became a more ferocious group in the counter-revolutionary group at that time. The above is the situation on the counter-revolutionary camp. On the revolutionary side, a year and a half before the "February 7th" struggle, that is, in July 1921, the party of the Chinese working class, the Chinese Communist Party, which led the Chinese people in the anti-imperialist and anti-feudal revolution, had already been established. Since its inception, the CPC has paid great attention to the workers' movement. The CPC established the Secretariat of the Chinese Labor Union in Beijing as an agency to lead the national workers' movement. The work of the workers on the Beijing-Hankou Railway was one of their goals. In 1922, workers' struggles spread to almost all important enterprises and mines across the country, among which the most famous were the Hong Kong Seamen's Strike that lasted 56 days starting in January of that year, and the Kailuan Five Mines Strike that occurred in October and lasted more than 20 days. In the same year, the first National Labor Congress was held in Guangzhou on May Day. During this period, various trade unions were established across the country. Through these struggles, under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, the Chinese working class quickly united its ranks, not only fighting for its own economic interests, but also becoming the vanguard and leader of the Chinese people's anti-imperialist and anti-feudal revolution.
    The "February 7th" struggle took place on this basis. On February 1, 1923, the General Labor Union of the Beijing-Hankou Railway was established in Zhengzhou. Hundreds of representatives from the Beijing-Hankou Railway and guests from trade unions across the country attended. The warlord Wu Peifu sent troops to surround the venue that day, arrested representatives, and prohibited the meeting. However, the representatives and guests bravely held the opening ceremony in the encirclement of the army. After the meeting, the military police immediately destroyed the venue, occupied the site of the General Labor Union, heavily surrounded the representatives' and guests' residences, and carried out armed suppression. That evening, the General Labor Union decided that the entire railway would start a general strike on the morning of the 4th. During the strike, all actions were to be directed by the General Labor Union, and the General Labor Union of the Beijing-Hankou Railway was moved to Jiang'an in Hankou to handle affairs. The resolution to launch the strike stated: "We fight for freedom, we fight for human rights, and we will never retreat!" The strike was implemented throughout the railway after noon on the 4th. On the 5th, Xiao Yaonan, the military governor of Hubei, a henchman of Wu Peifu, sent people to Jiang'an to force the workers to hand over the leaders of the trade union and force them to resume work, but they were firmly rejected by the workers. Several members of the workers' picket team were arrested. On the 6th, more than 10,000 trade union members and railway workers in Wuhan held a meeting to protest and held a demonstration, going straight into the British concession. At the same time, similar incidents occurred at major stations along the Beijing-Hankou Railway, and the workers resolutely refused to yield. On the afternoon of the 7th, after consultation and instructions from the British imperialist consul in Hankou, Xiao Yaonan's troops surrounded the General Labor Union and began a bloody massacre, killing more than 30 workers, wounding more than 200, and arresting Comrade Lin Xiangqian, a member of the Jiang'an Branch Committee and a member of the Chinese Communist Party, and dozens of others. Comrade Lin Xiangqian was tied to a telephone pole and forced to order the resumption of work. The cruel warlord representative ordered the executioner to cut Comrade Lin first, asking him: "Will you resume work?" Lin said loudly, "No!" After several cuts, Lin's answer was always: "Resuming work requires the order of the General Labor Union. My head can be cut off, but I will not resume work!" Finally, he cursed: "We cannot let a good China be ruined in the hands of you bastard warlords!" The warlord representative immediately ordered Lin to be beheaded as a warning to the public. The outstanding and heroic representative of the Chinese working class sacrificed gloriously and generously in this way. On the same day, a similar tragedy occurred in Changxindian in the northern section of the Beijing-Hankou Railway, with four deaths, more than 30 serious injuries, and countless minor injuries. Tragedies also occurred at other stations. On February 15th, Lawyer Shi Yang, a member of the Chinese Communist Party who actively participated in the strike, was also brutally murdered in Wuchang. After the tragedy, sympathetic strikes occurred on the Daokou-Qinghua Railway, the Zhengtai Railway, the Tianjin-Pukou Railway, the Guangdong-Hankou Railway, the Beijing-Fengtian Railway, and the Beijing-Suiyuan Railway. Citizens and students in Beijing held protest demonstrations and a memorial meeting of more than 5,000 people. This is a simple account of the "February 7th" struggle.
    The goals of the martyrs and heroes of the "February 7th" were to fight for the freedom and rights of the Chinese working class and to oppose imperialism and its running dogs, the Chinese warlords. Twenty-seven years ago, under the reactionary rule of imperialism and feudal warlords, the Chinese working class not only had no freedom to organize trade unions, but also had no right to survival, and was completely in a state of slavery subjected to cruel oppression and exploitation. However, in these twenty-seven years of arduous and heroic struggle, the Chinese working class has won great victories in anti-imperialism, anti-feudalism, and anti-bureaucratic capitalism throughout the country because it has gained the wise leadership of the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao, because it has the heroic and good fighting of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, because it has led the vast peasant masses to carry out resolute struggles and the great unity of the people of the whole country. Today, the social and political status of the Chinese working class is fundamentally different from what it was twenty-seven years ago. The Chinese working class has obtained all the freedoms and rights that were fought for with sacrifices and bloodshed in the "February 7th" era, fundamentally overthrown the reactionary rule of the imperialist and feudal comprador forces that had long oppressed us, and established the people's democratic dictatorship led by the working class and based on the worker-peasant alliance. The Chinese working class, which was once slaves arbitrarily oppressed, exploited, and massacred by imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism, has today become the master of the country and society. Therefore, this year's commemoration of the "February 7th" has a particularly significant meaning different from any previous year. Workers across the country should recognize the importance of their responsibility as masters of the country. At a time when the revolutionary war has not yet finally ended, the restoration and development of production is urgently needed, and the country's finances are in difficulty, the working class should lead and unite the people of the whole country with a spirit of hard work and a model role, carry the revolutionary war to the end, liberate Hainan Island, Taiwan and Tibet, completely annihilate the remaining reactionary forces, consolidate our achieved victories; and help the government overcome financial and economic difficulties, accelerate the restoration and development of production, make our motherland stronger and more prosperous day by day, complete the great cause of the new democratic revolution, and further lead the vast masses of our people to the ideal and happy society, the socialist society!
    Eternal glory to the martyrs of the "February 7th" strike!

　　“二七”简史
    距今二十七周年以前，以京汉铁路工人为主体，中国工人阶级举行了历史上空前英勇的一次政治大罢工——“二七”大罢工。当时中国的政治情况，简单说来是这样：整个的华北直至长江中流，大体是在以曹锟、吴佩孚为首的所谓“直系”（直指直隶，即今河北）军阀的统治之下。在长江的下游省份，是直系与另一个以段祺瑞为首的“皖系”（安徽籍军阀为首）军阀集团统治着。西南各省为另外一些依靠于“直”、“皖”之间的大小军阀割据称雄。孙中山当时在两广活动，希望以当地军阀的力量为基础来和北方的军阀对抗。关外的东北则在“奉系”（奉指奉天，即今辽宁）军阀张作霖等之手。而所有这些军阀都是中国不同地区大地主、大资产阶级的代表和一个或几个帝国主义国家的走狗，他们是中国的半殖民地半封建统治的代表者，是中国人民的凶恶敌人。在当时这些军阀集团中，以直系军阀的吴佩孚握有的军事势力最大，他们据有中央政权，所以又成为当时反革命集团中更为凶恶的一个集团。以上是反革命阵营方面的情形。在革命方面，则在“二七”斗争的一年半以前，即一九二一年七月，领导中国人民进行反帝反封建革命的中国工人阶级的政党——中国共产党已经成立了。中共自产生之日起，即十分注意工人运动。中共在北京成立了中国劳动组合书记部，作为领导全国工人运动的机关。京汉铁路的工人工作，便是他们努力的目标之一。一九二二年，工人的斗争遍及于几乎一切全国重要的企业矿山，其中最著名的几次便是当年一月开始的历时五十六天的香港海员大罢工，十月发生历时二十余天的开滦五矿大罢工。同年的五一节，第一次全国劳动大会在广州召开。在此时期，全国各种工会纷纷成立。经过这些斗争，中国工人阶级在中国共产党的领导之下，迅速地团结了自己的队伍，不但为自己的经济利益而斗争，并且成了中国人民反帝反封建革命的先锋队和领导者。
    “二七”的斗争，便是在这样的基础上发生的。一九二三年二月一日，京汉铁路总工会在郑州成立，到京汉路代表及全国各地工会来宾数百人。军阀吴佩孚是日派兵包围会场，拘捕代表，不准开会。但各代表及来宾仍在军队包围中英勇的举行了开幕式。会后军警即捣毁会场，占领总工会会址，重兵包围代表及来宾住所，实行武装镇压。是日晚，总工会决定全路于四日上午起总同盟罢工，在罢工期内，一切行动听总工会指挥，并将京汉铁路总工会移往汉口的江岸办事。在这个发动罢工的决议中说：“我们为争自由而战，为争人权而战，决无退后！”罢工于四日正午后全路实行。五日，吴佩孚爪牙湖北督军萧耀南派人到江岸，强迫工人交出工会领袖，并强迫开工，均经工人坚决拒绝，又捕去工人纠察团纠察数名。六日，武汉各工会及铁路工人万余开会抗议，并举行示威，直入英租界。同时，京汉路各大站均发生类似事件，工人坚决不屈。七日下午，萧耀南的军队在汉口英帝国主义领事计议指示之后，即包围总工会，开始血腥屠杀，击死工人三十余人，击伤二百余人，捕去江岸分会委员长中国共产党员林祥谦同志及其他数十人，将林祥谦同志缚于电杆上，迫令要他下令复工。残酷的军阀代表令刽子手将林同志先砍一刀，问他：“上不上工？”林大声说“不上！”如是连砍数刀，林的回答总是：“上工要总工会的命令，我的头可断，工是不上的！”最后并大骂：“不能让好好的一个中国，断送在你们这般混账王八旦的军阀手里！”军阀代表立即下令将林斩首示众。中国工人阶级优秀的英勇的代表就是这样光荣地慷慨地牺牲了。同日，京汉路北段的长辛店，也发生类似惨案，死四人，重伤三十余人，轻伤无数。其他车站也有惨案发生。二月十五日，积极参与罢工的中共党员施洋律师，又被惨杀于武昌。惨案发生后，道清路、正太路、津浦路、粤汉路、京奉路、京绥路都发生了同情罢工。北京的市民、学生举行了抗议示威和五千多人的追悼大会。这就是“二七”斗争的简单经过。
    “二七”的先烈们和英雄们斗争的目标，是争取中国工人阶级的自由权利、反对帝国主义及其走狗中国军阀。二十七年以前，中国工人阶级在帝国主义与封建军阀的反动统治下，不仅没有组织工会的自由，而且连生存的权利都没有，完全处在遭受残酷压迫剥削的奴隶地位。然而，在这二十七年艰苦卓绝的英勇奋斗中，中国工人阶级由于获得了中国共产党和毛主席的英明领导，由于有了中国人民解放军的英勇善战，由于领导了广大农民群众进行坚决斗争和全国人民的大团结，已在全国范围内取得了反帝国主义、反封建主义、反官僚资本主义的伟大胜利。今天，中国工人阶级的社会政治地位已和二十七年前根本不同了。中国工人阶级已获得了“二七”时代牺牲流血所争取的一切自由权利，根本推翻了长期压迫我们的帝国主义和封建买办势力的反动统治，建立了以工人阶级为领导的、以工农联盟为基础的人民民主专政的中华人民共和国。中国工人阶级，过去是被帝国主义、封建主义与官僚资本主义所任意压迫、剥削、屠杀的奴隶，今天变成了国家社会的主人。因此，这是今年纪念“二七”与过去任何一年不同的特别重大的意义。全国工人应当认识作为国家主人翁的责任的重大。在目前革命战争尚未最后结束，恢复与发展生产又急不容缓，国家财政困难的时候，工人阶级应以刻苦耐劳的模范作用，领导并团结全国人民，把革命战争进行到底，解放海南岛、台湾和西藏，彻底歼灭残余的反动势力，巩固我们已得的胜利；并帮助政府克服财政经济上的困难，加紧恢复与发展生产，使我们的祖国一天天富强、繁荣起来，完成新民主主义革命的伟大事业，并进一步领导我国广大人民群众，一直走向我们理想的幸福的社会，社会主义社会！
    “二七”死难的先烈们永垂不朽！
