Following the report of the model deeds of Li Jinghua, the conductor of the "Masses" bus, a flagship passenger vehicle in Northeast China, the train staff received eighty-five thank-you letters from passengers. The letter writers included wounded soldiers, workers, farmers, students, and merchants, who all unanimously praised the "Masses" train's spirit of serving the people. On June 30th of last year, a woman was about to give birth on the train. Li Jinghua found a midwife among the passengers, ensuring the safe delivery of the child. Li Jinghua then hired a horse-drawn carriage to send the mother and child home. The passengers all said that the "Masses" train is a true "Masses" train. Subsequently, Jiang Ruiting, a member of the West Fuxin Branch of the Trade Union in Northeast China, reported on the West Fuxin Station United Labor Group. The group's main experience is: it is necessary to take the station as the main body, unite the machine, inspection, industrial, and electrical departments, unite together, achieve consistent steps from the Party, government, youth, and workers, promote democracy, and encourage the masses to offer ideas. On this basis, launching a mass revolutionary competition can utilize the method of signing joint labor contracts to unleash greater production power of the masses.

　　“群众号”客车深得旅客称赞
    继由东北客车旗帜“群众号”车长李静华报告该车的模范事绩；该列车人员曾接到旅客八十五封感谢信。写信的旅客，有负伤的战士、有工人、农民、学生和商人，信上一致称赞“群众号”列车为群众服务的精神。去年六月三十日，有个妇女在车上要生孩子。李静华在旅客中找到助产人，使孩子安全生下。李静华又给雇马车将产妇和婴孩送回家。旅客们都说“群众号”是真正的“群众号”。接着，东北西阜新分工会委员姜瑞亭报告西阜新车站联合劳动组。该组主要的经验是：必须以车站为主体，联合机、检、工、电各部门，团结起来，取得党、政、青、工步调一致，发扬民主，鼓励群众出主意。在这基础上，发动群众性的革命竞赛，就能利用订立联合劳动合同的方式，发挥群众生产更大的力量。
