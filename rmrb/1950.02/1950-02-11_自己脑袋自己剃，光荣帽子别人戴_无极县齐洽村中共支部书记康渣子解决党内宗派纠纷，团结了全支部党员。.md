　　“Shaving Your Own Head, Letting Others Wear the Glorious Hat”
    Kang Zhazi, the Party Branch Secretary of Qiqia Village, Wuji County, Hebei, never attended school and doesn't recognize a single character. Since joining the Communist Party in 1943, he has learned to recognize some characters through the Party's cultivation and education. However, when documents and instructions come from the county and district, he still has to run around asking this person to look at them and that person to read them. He struggles with writing and calculations. Therefore, he made up his mind to study culture. He bought a pencil and a notebook and borrowed a Chinese textbook from the elementary school, which he always carried in his pocket. When he saw someone who could read, he would take out the book and ask them, and if he recognized a character, he would learn to write it. He would learn new characters from newspapers and other books and then record them in his notebook. No matter where he went, he never put down his notebook and book. For example, when he was working in the fields and resting, he would take out his notebook and practice writing; when he was waiting for others at meetings, he would do the same. After studying like this for about a year, he learned seven or eight hundred characters. Especially after becoming the branch secretary last year, his studies became even more intense. On the 3rd, 6th, and 9th of each month, he would go to the school and ask the teachers to teach him characters. In this way, he made very rapid progress. Now he can take his own notes, and during the general training of village party members, he can teach them according to the party member textbook. Recently, he also learned how to use a dictionary (four-corner coding) from the teacher. Because he is learning and improving quickly, he is able to do his job more effectively.

    The factionalism and disagreements among the party members in Qiqia Village were well-known throughout the county. The village's forty-four party members were divided into two major factions, old and new, who treated each other like enemies and were very passive in their work. After Kang Zhazi became the branch secretary, he tried various methods to solve this problem. He discovered that the factionalism started with a few branch committee members. Among the seven branch committee members, there were also old and new factions, and they rarely met together. Even when they did meet, their opinions were not unified, and no one would give each other advice. They protected each other and only gave advice to others, without reflecting on themselves. Those who were criticized not only did not accept the criticism but also argued, leading to a situation where people didn't express their opinions and kept them bottled up inside. Party members who were originally active in their work became less so due to the suppression of factionalism.

    Kang Zhazi prescribed the right remedy. The branch committee originally stipulated that meetings should be held every ten days. Kang Zhazi and the branch committee members discussed holding meetings every five days, with one meeting every ten days specifically for studying and discussing work, and the other for mutual criticism and self-criticism. At each meeting, he would first ask other branch committee members to give him advice. Regardless of whether the advice was correct or incorrect, he would not get impatient. If the advice was correct, he would sincerely accept it and thank the person; if the advice was incorrect, he would smile and explain it to the person. This influenced other branch committee members to also accept each other's opinions amiably and humbly. For example, Xu Luoming, the branch's organization committee member, used to be unhappy when others gave him advice. Now, he sincerely considers and accepts other people's opinions. He said, "Kang Zhazi has reformed my temper." Now, the seven members of the branch committee are as united as one person.

    After the branch committee was united, they further studied ways to transform the party members. They began by using the method of "Shaving Your Own Head, Letting Others Wear the Glorious Hat." "Shaving Your Own Head" meant that if old-faction party members had shortcomings, old-faction branch committee members would educate and criticize them; if new-faction party members had shortcomings, new-faction branch committee members would educate and criticize them. This allowed the criticized comrades to better accept criticism and correct their shortcomings. "Letting Others Wear the Glorious Hat" meant that if old-faction party members had advantages, new-faction branch committee members would praise them; if new-faction party members had advantages, old-faction branch committee members would praise them. In this way, both the old and new factions of party members approved of and supported the branch committee. For example, party member Kang Daju said, "The current branch committee members are truly selfless." After more than four months of transformation and education, the party members in the whole village were truly united and worked actively. For example, village head Kang Xinhua and Wu Weihui Deputy Director Ma Jitang, who had not spoken to each other for several years due to disagreements, are now very closely united and working very actively. For example, during last year's autumn grain requisition, this village had always had arrears and the requisition time was very long. But this time, thanks to the active leadership of the party members, the task of 40,000 jin of grain and 20,000 jin of cotton was quickly completed.

    Kang Zhazi not only leads the party members well but also leads the masses in production in the village with great enthusiasm. To develop winter production, he organized twenty people to go to Jin County to gin cotton. After taking the masses there, he was afraid that ginning cotton there would affect the work in the village, so he let someone replace him after ginning for two days. The masses who ginned cotton in Jin County have been ginning for more than two months, earning more than 12,000 jin of rice, which solved the winter and spring living difficulties for twenty households with eighty-six people and laid the foundation for this year's production. Some of the cotton ginners were moved to say: "Comrade Kang Zhazi is really good to us, otherwise, we would be starving in the spring." (Attached picture)

    Kang Zhazi also takes out his notebook to study when he rests while working in the fields.

　　“自己脑袋自己剃，光荣帽子别人戴”
    无极县齐洽村中共支部书记康渣子解决党内宗派纠纷，团结了全支部党员。
    河北无极县齐洽村支部书记康渣子，他从来没上过学，一个大字也不识。自一九四三年参加了共产党以后，在党的培养教育下，才认识了一些字。可是县区来了文件和指示等，还得东跑西奔，找这个看看，找那个念念。对动笔动算盘的事，他都很遭难。因此他就下定了决心学习文化。自己买了一枝铅笔和一个本子，还在小学里借了一册国语，经常装在自己口袋里，见了识字的人，掏出书来就问，认会了就学写；在报纸上或别的书上学了字，就记在本子上。他无论到什么地方去，都不肯放下他的本子和书。如下地做活休息时，他就掏出本子学写；开会时等着别人，他也同样的学习。这样学习了一年的光景，学会了有七八百个字。尤其是去年担任支部书记以后，他的学习更显加劲，三、六、九到学校去让教员教字。这样他的进步非常快，现在他已能够自己做笔记，村党员进行普训，他能按照党员课本，给党员们上课。最近又向教员学查字典（四角号码）。他学习进步快，工作的办法也就多了。
    齐洽村党员闹意见分派别，在全县也是数得着的。全村四十四个党员分新旧两大派，见面和仇人一样，工作都很消极。康渣子当了支部书记以后，他就想各种办法来解决这个问题。他发现了这个派别是从几个支部委员闹起来的，七个支委中也有新旧两派，在一块开会时候很少。即使开会，意见也是不统一，并且谁也不给谁提意见。各自互相包庇，光对别人提意见，不检讨自己。被提意见的人，不但不接受，反倒争吵起来，直闹得有意见互相不提，都积压在心里。原来在工作方面还积极的党员因为受到宗派邪气的压制，也不积极了。
    康渣子按症下药。支委会原本规定十天开一次会，康渣子和支委们商讨着每五天开一次，十天中一次专门研究讨论工作，一次互相批评和检讨。每次开会时，他先让别的支委给他提意见，别的支委无论提的正确与不正确，他都不着急，提的意见正确，他就诚恳的接受和感谢别人；提的意见不正确，他笑着给别人解释。这样影响别的支委们也能和蔼、虚心的接受别人意见了。如支部组织委员许洛明，过去别人向他提意见，总表示不高兴。现在谁给他提意见，他都诚恳考虑与接受别人意见。他说：“康渣子算把我的脾气改造好了。”现在支部的七个委员，都团结的像一个人一样。
    支部委员会团结了，他们就进一步研究改造党员的办法。开始是用“自己脑袋自己剃，光荣帽子别人戴”的办法来改造。“自己脑袋自己剃”，就是旧派党员有了缺点，由旧派的支委去教育批评；新派的党员有缺点，由新派的支委去教育批评。这样使被批评的同志，能够很好的接受批评改正缺点。“光荣帽子别人戴”，就是旧派的党员有优点，由新派的支委去表扬；新派的党员有优点，由旧派支委去表扬；这样以来，使着新旧派的党员对支委都很赞成和拥护。如党员康大聚说：“现在的支委们真是大公无私。”经过了四个多月的改造教育后，全村的党员真正团结起来积极的工作。如村长康新华、武委会副主任马计堂，因闹意见好几年都不说话，现在已经团结得很密切，工作都很积极。如去年秋征时，历年来这村征收都留下尾欠，征收的时间又很长。可是这次秋征由于党员们的积极带头，四万斤谷子、两万斤棉花的任务，很快的就完成了。
    康渣子不但对党员领导的好，在村里领导群众生产也挺带劲。开展冬季生产，他组织了二十个人到晋县去轧花。他将群众带去以后，他在那里轧花，恐怕影响村里的工作，轧了两天就让别人换回他来。在晋县轧花的群众已经轧了两个多月，挣米一万二千多斤，解决了二十户八十六人冬春的生活困难，并打下了今年生产的基础，感动的轧花的一些人说：“康渣子同志算对我们真有好处，不然，春天非挨饿不行。”（附图片）
    康渣子下地作活休息时，也拿出本子来学习。
