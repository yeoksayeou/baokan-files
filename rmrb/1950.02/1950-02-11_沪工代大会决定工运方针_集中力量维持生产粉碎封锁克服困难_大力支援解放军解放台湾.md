Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 10th. The Shanghai Municipal Workers' Representative Congress, held from the 3rd to the 7th, unanimously passed the "Resolution on the Current Direction and Tasks of the Shanghai Workers' Movement." The resolution calls on the million workers of Shanghai to vigorously support the People's Liberation Army in liberating Taiwan, strengthen production work, learn to manage factories, strengthen trade union organizational work, and ensure the completion of production tasks under the policy of concentrating efforts, maintaining production, smashing blockades, and overcoming difficulties.

The resolution first pointed out: The Shanghai working class has been liberated after a long period of arduous struggle. The workers' movement in the eight months since liberation has also achieved many successes, but we still face serious difficulties. Due to the armed blockade and continuous bombing by imperialism and its running dogs; due to the long-term devastation and exploitation suffered by the vast rural areas at the hands of the Kuomintang bandits before liberation; and because land reform has not yet been implemented in the vast new rural areas, there are great difficulties in maintaining production, supplying raw materials, and selling finished products; at the same time, the War of Liberation has not yet ended, and war expenses must still be borne. Therefore, the Shanghai working class must exert a high degree of initiative and creativity to lead the people of the city and help the People's Government overcome difficulties. Based on the above situation, the resolution determines that the basic policy for Shanghai workers at present is: concentrate efforts, maintain production, smash blockades, and overcome difficulties. The resolution pointed out: The current tasks of the Shanghai workers' movement are:

(1) Vigorously support the People's Liberation Army in liberating Taiwan, smash the enemy's blockade, overcome difficulties, rely on our own efforts, and consolidate the regime. The Shanghai working class should vigorously support the People's Liberation Army by striving to produce, ensuring transportation, and all other means. This is an important political task of the working class. The working class is now the master of the country and should demonstrate a high degree of class consciousness, conserve raw materials and power, maintain machinery, and proactively propose various methods to assist the administration or capitalists in maintaining factories and enterprises. Therefore, Shanghai workers must be prepared, when necessary and based on the actual degree of difficulty, to temporarily reduce their living standards to maintain or change the production policy of enterprises. The working class should respond to all government calls and become a model for implementing the policies and decrees of the People's Government.

(2) Strengthen production work, learn to manage factories, strive for improvement and recovery of production, and prepare conditions for the development of production. In state-owned enterprises, implement factory management democratization in a step-by-step manner, cultivate workers' management capabilities, universally sign collective contracts, and especially promote the signing of collective contracts within the scope of a single trade or industry under the principle of voluntarism, and organize labor competitions.

(3) Strengthen trade union organizational work to ensure the completion of production tasks. First, it is necessary to strengthen trade union organizational work, improve the basic organizations of industrial unions, help unorganized workers to organize quickly, and be good at uniting specialized technical personnel, breaking down sectarian guild concepts, giving play to the democratic style of trade union work, strengthening trade union discipline, and overcoming formalism and paternalistic tendencies. Secondly, it is necessary to strengthen technical and business research, promote creation and invention, improve the relationship between masters and apprentices, pay attention to the training of trade union work cadres, and conduct planned business studies for in-service cadres, extensively establish workers' clubs, and make them a garden for workers to exchange production experience, regulate workers' lives, improve production morale, and carry out study and entertainment.

(4) Protect the daily interests of workers, assist in overcoming the bureaucratic style of state-owned enterprise organs, and oppose the excessive exploitation of capitalists in private enterprises. Carry out workers' welfare undertakings within the realm of possibility, promote various mutual assistance methods among workers, and pay attention to factory safety and hygiene to protect state property and the lives, safety, and health of workers.

The resolution finally pointed out: The Shanghai working class must not be arrogant or impetuous when performing its tasks, carry forward the spirit of self-criticism, maintain its consistent style of hard struggle, diligence, and simplicity, learn with humility, and consolidate its unity.

　　沪工代大会决定工运方针
    集中力量维持生产粉碎封锁克服困难 
    大力支援解放军解放台湾
    【新华社上海十日电】于三日至七日举行的上海市工人代表大会一致通过了“关于上海工人运动当前的方针与任务”的决议，决议号召全上海百万工人在集中力量、维持生产、粉碎封锁、克服困难的方针下，大力支援解放军解放台湾，加强生产工作，学会管理工厂；加强工会组织工作，保证完成生产任务。
    决议首先指出：上海工人阶级经过长期的艰苦斗争，已经得到了解放。解放后八个月来的工人运动也已获得了不少成绩，但我们面前还存在着严重的困难。由于帝国主义及其走狗的武装封锁和继续不断的轰炸；由于广大农村在解放前长期遭受国民党匪帮惨重摧残和榨取；由于广大的新区农村还未实行土地改革，因此生产的维持、原料的供给和成品的销路上都存在着很大的困难；同时，解放战争尚未结束，战争的开支仍须负担。因此上海工人阶级必须发挥高度的积极性和创造性，领导全市人民，帮助人民政府克服困难。根据上述情况，决议确定上海工人当前的基本方针是：集中力量，维持生产，粉碎封锁，克服困难。决议指出：上海工人运动当前的任务为：
    （一）大力支援解放军解放台湾，粉碎敌人封锁，克服困难，自力更生，巩固政权。上海工人阶级应以努力生产、保证交通运输等一切办法，大力支援解放军。这是工人阶级重要的政治任务。工人阶级现在已是国家的主人，应发挥高度的阶级自觉，节约原料动力，保养机器，主动提出各种办法，协助行政或资方把工厂企业维持下去。因此，上海工人必须准备在必要时根据实际困难程度，暂时降低生活待遇，以维持或改变企业的生产方针。工人阶级应响应政府一切号召，并成为执行人民政府政策法令的模范。
    （二）加强生产工作，学会管理工厂，争取生产的好转与恢复，为生产的发展准备条件。在公营企业中，有步骤地实行工厂管理民主化，培养工人的管理能力，普遍签订集体合同，特别要普遍推行在自愿原则下以一行一业为范围订立集体合同，组织劳动竞赛。
    （三）加强工会组织工作，保证完成生产任务。首先要加强工会组织工作，健全产业工会的基层组织，帮助尚未组织的工人迅速组织起来，并要善于团结专门技术人员，打破帮派行会观念，发挥工会工作的民主作风，加强工会纪律性，克服形式主义和包办代替的偏向。其次要加强技术业务研究，提倡创造发明，改善师徒关系，注重培养工会工作干部，应有计划地进行在职干部的业务学习，广泛建立工人俱乐部，使之成为工人群众交流生产经验、调剂工人生活、提高生产情绪、进行学习和娱乐的园地。
    （四）保护工人日常利益，协助克服公营企业机关的官僚主义作风，反对私营企业中资本家的过分剥削行为。在可能范围内举办工人福利事业，发扬工人中各种生活互助办法，注意工厂的安全卫生，以保护国家财产和工人的生命安全和健康。
    决议最后指出：上海工人阶级在执行自己的任务时，必须不骄不躁，发扬自我批评精神，保持历来的艰苦奋斗、勤劳朴素的作风，虚心学习，巩固自己的团结和统一。
