The Relationship Between Marxism-Leninism and Natural Science
《China Youth》 Issue 31 Publishes Important Article

[Our Newspaper News] The Central Committee of the Communist Youth League's publication—《China Youth》, issue 31, was published on the 28th. This issue focuses on the problem of Marxism-Leninism and natural science. It emphatically explains that natural science must be explored and studied from the standpoint, viewpoint, and method of Marxism-Leninism. It is especially worth reading for natural science teachers and science and engineering students. This issue contains a new translation of Engels' "Introduction to Dialectics of Nature", Li Ya's "Natural Science Illuminated by Marxism-Leninism", and Wen Jize's "The Bourgeois Worldview in Natural Science", among other articles. Biologists Professor Zhou Jianren and Professor Pei Wenzhong also published articles in this issue. The question and answer column answers the question of whether Newton's laws of motion conflict with materialist dialectics.
