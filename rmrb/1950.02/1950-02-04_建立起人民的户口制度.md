Establishing a People's Household Registration System
	·Kē Fū·
	What was the exact population of Beijing before liberation? It was a complete mess. The Kuomintang bandit gang, relying on a small number of special agents and police, implemented a reactionary "police control" rule, often using household registration checks to persecute and extort the people, forcing tens of thousands of citizens to avoid registering their households or to falsely register in order to evade the reactionaries' conscription and taxation.

	After liberation, in order to establish a new household registration system that protects the people and controls reactionary elements, the People's Government began in July of last year by first abolishing the "police control" of the Kuomintang reactionary rule and establishing a people's household registration system—a specialized household registration system, with designated personnel in each police station to manage household registration work. The household registration book was also changed from a three-part system to a one-part system, canceling the household registration books of the Municipal Public Security Bureau and its sub-bureaus, retaining only one copy in the police station. The household registration organization was changed from a dual system to a unitary system, canceling the household registration organization of the Municipal Civil Affairs Bureau and unifying it under the Municipal Public Security Bureau. At the same time, a city-wide household registration verification was conducted for more than two months, clarifying the chaotic situation of household registration and initially obtaining the statistical materials and household registration management experience necessary for city construction.

	In order to further determine the citizenship of citizens and collect household registration statistics as a basis for building the people's capital, the Beijing Municipal People's Government promulgated in November of last year the "Beijing Municipal Citizen Household Registration Rules" and "Penalty Rules for Violating the Beijing Municipal Citizen Household Registration Rules." It was decided that from November 18th, the fifteen types of forms and complicated procedures of the pseudo-police and civil affairs bureaus before liberation would be abolished, and the Public Security Bureau was instructed to replace the household registration slips of all citizens in the city with household registration booklets. From then on, except when establishing a new household upon moving in, where citizens must provide their own household registration booklet, and when applying for a removal certificate upon moving out, all other changes only require the citizen to verbally report to the police station with the household registration booklet and necessary documents, simplifying the household registration procedures and providing convenience to the general public in terms of economy and time.

	For the work of replacing household registration booklets throughout the city, the Municipal Public Security Bureau first formulated an implementation plan, and universally conducted education and mobilization among cadres and police officers in each sub-bureau and police station. It formulated propaganda outlines and methods. From November 18th to 23rd, the city launched a universal household registration rectification propaganda campaign. In addition to posting announcements and slogans and using blackboards, movies, and loudspeakers for propaganda, each sub-bureau also convened more than 5,000 various citizen meetings, household head meetings, resident group leader meetings, neighborhood head meetings, and shop and inn industry meetings, taking into account both urban and rural areas and in line with practical principles, combined with the central work of each district, and with police stations as the units. In addition, in conjunction with the Municipal Government Suburban Committee, the Beijing Municipal Committee Propaganda Department of the Chinese Communist Party, the Municipal Public Security Corps, and workers and students, totaling more than 20,000 people, they formed mobile propaganda teams or performed operas, clappers, and crosstalk related to household registration reform in entertainment venues. Individual sub-bureaus also combined with relevant organs in the district to organize specialized household registration booklet replacement agencies, adopting a unified leadership and separate mobilization propaganda method, which achieved remarkable results. Therefore, the broad masses of citizens were able to clearly recognize the significance of the new household registration system, opening a smooth situation for the work of replacing household registration booklets. An old lady in Lumicang, District One, said: "In the past, reporting a household registration required writing eight copies, running around, getting angry, and being scolded, and you still couldn't register. The new household registration saves money and is convenient, and even illiterate children and women can register, and there is no need to spend money on treating people anymore." Zhang Dewu said: "The People's Government is thinking for us. We can't let one fish spoil the whole pot. Now, household registration must be managed in this way, distinguishing between good and bad, and life will be peaceful."

	The formal replacement of household registration booklets began on November 24th and was fully completed on December 23rd. In the replacement work, in order to promote the progress of overall work, the Municipal Public Security Bureau, in addition to establishing a reporting system at all levels from bottom to top to grasp the situation and exchange experiences, also organized three groups to go to each sub-bureau inside and outside the city for inspection. Each sub-bureau also formed groups to inspect the police stations, which not only helped work to be carried out and correct deviations, but also allowed them to absorb experience and promote it comprehensively. Most police stations notified each resident in advance of the filling time, asking them to wait at home, and then went door-to-door, using the old household registration slip as a reference, combined with specific understanding of the situation, to fill it out accurately, which not only saved time but also yielded great results.

	According to the correct statistics after this replacement of household registration booklets, as of the end of December, there were a total of 441,799 households and 2,030,986 people in the city (including institutions, schools, and state-owned factories). Among the citizens' occupations, 68,560 were engaged in industry and mining, 77,866 in handicrafts, 162,935 in agriculture, 159,633 in commerce, 11,907 in education, 26,813 were government employees, 58,822 were independent laborers, 97,132 were peddlers, 104,582 were engaged in other occupations, and another 231,662 had no fixed occupation (students, housewives, and children were not included in the statistics). This statistics provides great assistance to the people's capital's municipal administration, industry, culture, education, health construction, taxation, transportation and other works, especially for public security work. Through this work, a total of 208 unregistered Kuomintang secret agents, 1,603 dispersed soldiers, 15,338 who attempted to underreport household registration, 60 who falsely reported household registration, and 12,676 other security-endangering elements such as those who secretly hid weapons, concealed enemy property, smoked and sold drugs, and fabricated rumors and sabotaged were discovered. In addition, accurate household registration information was obtained as a basis for urban construction; in particular, the household registration management system was simplified, the leading agency for household registration management was unified, and the legal spirit of democracy for the people and dictatorship for reactionary elements was clearly established. It established a mass viewpoint of facilitating the majority of citizens and controlling a minority of bad elements, and thoroughly improved the police-people relationship.

　　建立起人民的户口制度
    ·柯夫·
    北京市的人口到底有多少？解放前是一本糊涂账。国民党匪帮依靠少数特务、警察实行反动的“警管制”统治，并常借查户口对人民进行残害、勒索；迫使成千成万的市民不敢报户口或假报户口，以躲避反动派的抓兵、征税。
    解放后，人民政府为建立保护人民的、管制反动分子的新户口制度，遂于去年七月开始，首先废除国民党反动统治的“警管制”，建立了人民的户口制度——户口专任制，在每一派出所中设置专人管理户口工作；户口册亦由三部制改为一部制，取消市公安局和各分局的户口册，只保留派出所的一份户口册；户籍机构由二元化改为一元化，取消市民政局的户籍机构，而统一于市公安局。同时并在全市进行了两个多月的户口查对工作，澄清了户口的混乱现象，初步取得了建设城市所必需的统计材料和管理户籍的经验。
    北京市人民政府为进一步确定市民属籍，并搜集户口统计资料，作为建设人民首都的依据，又于去年十一月间公布了“北京市市民声报户口规则”及“违反市民声报户口规则罚则”；决定自十一月十八日起废除解放前伪警察、民政两局的十五种表册及繁琐手续，并责成公安局更换全市市民户口单为户口簿。自此开始，市民除迁入立户时须自备户口簿、迁出时请领迁出证外，其他一切变动，仅须持户口簿及必要证件到派出所口头声报即可，简化了声报户口手续，在经济和时间上方便了广大市民。
    更换全市户口簿工作，市公安局首先拟定了实施计划，在各分局、派出所的干部员警中，普遍进行了教育动员；拟定宣传大纲及方式，全市于十一月十八日至廿三日，展开了普遍的户口整理宣传，除张贴布告、标语及利用黑板报、电影、扩音器进行宣传外，各分局并在城乡兼顾、切合实际的原则下，结合各区中心工作，以派出所为单位召开各种市民会、户主会、居民组长会、闾长会、商店及旅栈业会五千余次。此外并结合市政府郊委会、中共北京市委会文委会、市公安总队和工人、学生等二万余人，分别组成巡回宣传队或在游艺场所演出有关户口改革的戏曲、快板和相声等。个别分局还结合该区中的有关机关组织了专门更换户口簿的机构，采取统一领导分头动员的宣传方式，收到了显著的成效。因此，广大市民能明确认识新户口制度的意义，为更换户口簿工作打开了顺利的局面。内一区禄米仓的一个老太太说：“过去报次户口要写八份，东奔西跑受气挨骂还报不上；新户口又省钱又省事，不识字的小孩妇女都能报，再不用花钱请客了。”张德武说：“人民政府是为咱们打算，不能让一条鱼腥了一锅汤，现在户口就得这样管，分清好坏，日子就太平了。”
    正式更换户口簿自十一月二十四日起到十二月二十三日全部完成。在更换工作中，市公安局为推动全面工作进展，除建立了自下而上的各级汇报制度，掌握情况，交流经验外，并组织了三个小组，分赴城内外各分局检查，各分局也分别组成小组到派出所检查，不但有助于工作开展，纠正偏差，且能吸取经验推广全面。大多数派出所都是预先将填写时间，分别通知各该住户居民在家等候，到时挨门挨户，以旧户口单作参考，结合具体了解情况，确实填写，既不浪费时间，而收获成绩又大。
    据此次更换户口簿后的正确统计，截至十二月底止，全市共有居民四十四万一千七百九十九户，二百零三万九百八十六人（机关、学校、公营工厂均统计在内）。在市民的职业中，从事工矿业的六万八千五百六十人，从事手工业的七万七千八百六十六人，从事农业的十六万二千九百三十五人，从事商业的十五万九千六百三十三人，从事教育的一万一千九百零七人，机关职员二万六千八百十三人，独立劳动者五万八千八百二十二人，小贩九万七千一百三十二人，从事其他职业的十万零四千五百八十二人，另有无一定职业的二十三万一千六百六十二人（学生、家庭妇女及小孩未统计在内）。这一统计，对人民首都的市政、工业、文化、教育、卫生建设、税收、交通等各种工作，都有很大的帮助，特别对治安工作帮助更大；经过这一工作，共发现未登记的国民党特务分子二百零八名，流散军人一千六百零三名，企图漏报户口的一万五千三百三十八名，假报户口的六十名，其他私藏武器、隐匿敌产、吸售毒品、造谣破坏等危害治安分子一万二千六百七十六名。此外并取得了正确的户籍资料，作为建设城市的依据；特别是简化了户口管理制度，统一了户口管理的领导机构，明确的树立起对人民内部民主，对反动分子专政的法制精神。树立了方便多数市民管制少数坏分子的群众观点，彻底改进了警民关系。
