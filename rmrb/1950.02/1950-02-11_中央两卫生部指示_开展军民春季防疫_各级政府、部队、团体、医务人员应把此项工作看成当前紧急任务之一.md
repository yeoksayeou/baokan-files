Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, February 10th.

The Central People's Government Ministry of Health and the Military Commission Ministry of Health today issued "Instructions to Governments and Troops at All Levels on Launching Spring Epidemic Prevention Work Among the Military and Civilians." The full text is as follows:

Recently, epidemics have been prevalent in various provinces and cities, spreading rapidly and extensively. The most common diseases are smallpox, epidemic cerebrospinal meningitis, and measles. The provinces along the Beijing-Hankou Railway and the central section of the Longhai Railway are particularly affected. Not long ago, in the Zaoyang area of Hubei, cerebrospinal meningitis and the aforementioned epidemics spread over 400 kilometers in half a month, causing approximately 400 deaths. Smallpox is prevalent in many places. Diphtheria has been found successively in major cities such as Shenyang, Beijing, Tianjin, and Shanghai. Scarlet fever and pertussis are also harmful in many areas. In addition, plague has been found in a small part of Fujian and Guangdong.

The prevalence of these epidemics is the result of long-term poverty, ignorance, and superstition caused by the rule of the reactionary classes in the past, especially the serious destruction caused by the fleeing bandits and enemies. Now that the national liberation war has just been won, the country's wounds have not yet fully recovered, and the people's scientific and health knowledge has not yet been popularized. Coupled with the impact of disasters in various places, it is possible for such epidemics to occur during this late winter and early spring. Governments at all levels, all troops, and people's organizations in various places must be seriously vigilant and pay attention to this phenomenon. They should take responsibility, mobilize the military and civilians, and strive to eliminate and prevent the prevalence of these epidemics. Now that spring plowing is about to begin, the prevalence of these epidemics not only endangers people's lives greatly, but also directly affects production. If we do not immediately be vigilant, it will cause even more serious losses.

Past experience has proven that all these epidemics can be prevented. As long as we pay close attention from the leadership level early on, and personally organize all health and medical forces to mobilize the masses to carry out practical and effective prevention and control, we have the strength and confidence to eliminate or stop the prevalence of epidemics.

Governments at all levels, all troops, all people's organizations, and even Chinese and Western doctors and other health workers should regard this work as one of the current urgent tasks. According to local conditions, refer to the following points and quickly deploy local epidemic prevention work:

Responsible persons of governments above the county level should personally lead, and health workers should participate in epidemic prevention.

(1) Responsible comrades of governments above the county level in and near epidemic areas should personally lead and organize epidemic prevention committees with the participation of representatives from all parties. Mobilize all necessary and possible manpower and material resources to fight against epidemics. In non-epidemic areas, preparations and mobilization should also be carried out to conduct general health work, especially universal vaccination and other preventive injections, to effectively prevent paralysis at the beginning of an epidemic, as well as the panic caused by the lack of preparation that leads to the spread of the epidemic.

(2) All health workers should participate in the government's epidemic prevention work. For the large number of traditional Chinese medicine practitioners, they should be trained to learn how to vaccinate and acquire necessary local epidemic prevention knowledge, and mobilize them to participate in epidemic prevention work. Military health workers, in addition to doing a good job in epidemic prevention in the troops, should also participate in the people's epidemic prevention work under the leadership of the government. Especially in remote areas, military health workers need to extract a part of their manpower to carry out epidemic prevention work among the local masses. Private medical practitioners should also be mobilized to participate in epidemic prevention work.

(3) Each county should organize mobile epidemic prevention teams as much as possible, carry out in-depth health publicity and universal vaccination in peacetime, and help establish district and township health organizations and promote health campaigns. Whenever infectious patients are encountered, they should be discovered and diagnosed as early as possible, and immediately isolated on the spot. Conduct timely disinfection, investigate the source of infection, and report to the higher authorities immediately. In addition, healthy contacts should be subject to health quarantine, and vaccination should be carried out for the infectious diseases found. Launch general clean-up and environmental sanitation work, and pay attention to publicity and education. In this way, even if an epidemic occurs, it may be eliminated in time and prevent its spread.

(4) Smallpox, measles, epidemic cerebrospinal meningitis, diphtheria, scarlet fever, and pertussis are all acute respiratory infectious diseases. Among them, smallpox is the easiest to prevent. As long as universal vaccination is implemented, patients and contacts are isolated, and secretions (phlegm, nasal mucus, clothing, and things that the patient has touched, etc.) are disinfected, it may be effective. Diphtheria has toxoid, and pertussis has vaccine. In children under seven years old, injections should be carried out as much as possible to reduce and avoid occurrence. For the prevention of measles, intramuscular injection of 5-10cc of recovered patient's or healthy person's blood can be adopted. To prevent the above-mentioned epidemics, people should also be guided to pay attention to air circulation, body cleanliness, and wear masks more often. In terms of treatment, in addition to diphtheria having diphtheria antitoxin, and epidemic cerebrospinal meningitis and scarlet fever can be effectively treated with sulfonamides and penicillin, the most important treatment is good care, drinking plenty of boiled water, avoiding wind, and preventing complications of other diseases. Generally, more drug treatment is not required.

(5) In the southeastern provinces, due to the warmer climate, plague is already possible. Attention should be paid to general preventive work. In areas where epidemics occur, the main task should be to isolate patients on the spot, blockade epidemic villages, and mobilize the masses to catch rats and kill fleas in large numbers, promote clean-up and sanitation campaigns, and universally inject plague vaccine. Plague patients can be cured if they are discovered early. For the disinfection of plague sickrooms, a 5% Lysol solution spray can be used. In particular, it is important to eliminate fleas with DDT. The method of disinfecting sickrooms by burning houses should no longer be used.

Expand health publicity, break superstitions; guarantee the supply of materials to the blocked areas.

(6) People in epidemic areas often take actions such as praying to gods and worshiping Buddha when epidemics occur due to long-term superstitious habits. Witches, monks, Taoists and other vagrants are also bound to take the opportunity to deceive, thus causing social unrest and panic, leading to people's exile and creating greater opportunities for transmission. It is necessary to expand health publicity, unite the masses, break superstitions, and stabilize people's hearts. For the people in the areas that have been discovered with epidemics and blocked, the government must vigorously adjust food, vegetables, fuel, and daily necessities, and transport them into the blocked areas to ensure their proper supply of materials.

(7) The People's Liberation Army troops should also carry out health and epidemic prevention campaigns in light of the specific infectious diseases in their respective garrisons. This campaign is not limited to cleaning up and vaccinations. The most important thing is to discover epidemics early and isolate patients immediately. In addition, a strict morning health check system can be carried out. Strengthen health education, and organize basic-level health organizations in platoons, companies and detachments. In addition to the health work of the troops, assist the local epidemic prevention and health work as much as possible.

During and at the end of the work, the situation should be reported at any time. When an epidemic occurs in a county or district, it should be reported to the central government as quickly as possible. After the end of each epidemic prevention campaign, a summary of the work must be made, and a comprehensive report must be submitted to the higher authorities.

### 中央两卫生部指示  开展军民春季防疫  各级政府、部队、团体、医务人员应把此项工作看成当前紧急任务之一

　　中央两卫生部指示开展军民春季防疫
    各级政府、部队、团体、医务人员应把此项工作看成当前紧急任务之一
    【新华社北京十日电】中央人民政府卫生部、军委卫生部，今日发布“关于开展军民春季防疫工作给各级人民政府及部队的指示”。全文如下：
    最近各省、市疫病流行；传播很快，蔓延很广，病类以天花，流行性脑脊髓膜炎，麻疹为最多。京汉铁路沿线及陇海铁路中段的各省受害尤重。不久以前，湖北枣阳一带，半月内脑脊髓膜炎及上述各种流行病蔓延四百余公里，死亡约四百余人。天花在许多地方流行。白喉曾先后在沈阳、北京、天津、上海等大城市发现。猩红热，百日咳也在不少地区为害，此外福建和广东一小部分地区并发现鼠疫。
    这些疫病的流行，是过去反动阶级统治下所造成的长期贫困、愚昧与迷信的结果，尤其是匪敌逃跑时严重破坏的结果。现在全国解放战争甫告胜利，国家的创伤尚未完全恢复，人民的科学卫生知识尚未普及，再加上各地灾荒的影响，值此冬末春初，是可能产生这种疫病流行的现象。各级人民政府，各部队以及各地人民团体对于这种现象，必须严重的警惕和注意。应该负起责任，发动军民，来努力扑灭和阻止这些疫病的流行。现在春耕就要开始，这些疫病的流行，不仅危害人民生命很大，并且直接影响到生产，如果不立即警惕，是会造成更严重的损失的。
    过去的经验证明，所有这些疫病，都是可以预防的。只要我们从领导上及早地切实注意，亲自动手组织一切卫生医药力量，发动群众，来进行切实有效的防治，我们就有力量并有把握来扑灭或制止疫病的流行。
    各级人民政府，各部队，各人民团体以至各地中西医师们和其他卫生工作人员们应该把这项工作看作是当前紧急任务之一，根据各地情况，参考下列各点，迅速布置当地的防疫工作：
    县级以上政府负责人应亲自领导，卫生工作人员均应参加防疫。
    （一）各疫区及邻近的县以上政府负责同志，应亲自领导，组织包括各方代表人员参加的防疫委员会。动员各种必需与可能的人力物力，向疫病作斗争。在非疫区，亦应有所准备与动员，进行一般卫生工作，特别是普种牛痘，及其他预防注射，切实防止在疫病发生之初的麻痹现象，以及因无准备而使疫病蔓延后的张惶失措现象。
    （二）一切卫生工作人员，均应参加政府的防疫工作。对于数量很大的中医，应训练他们学会种牛痘及当地必要的防疫知识，动员他们参加防疫工作。军队的卫生工作人员，除作好部队的防疫工作外，并应就地参加政府领导下的人民防疫工作。特别在偏僻地区，军队卫生工作人员更需抽出一部分人力在当地群众中进行防疫工作。私人开业医药人员亦应动员参加防疫工作。
    （三）各县均应尽可能的组织巡回防疫队，平时作深入的卫生宣传及普种牛痘，并帮助进行建立区乡卫生组织，推行卫生运动。凡遇传染病人，应及早发现并诊断，即行就地隔离，进行随时消毒，调查其传染来源，并立即向上级报告，此外对接触者应施行健康隔离，针对发现之传染病进行预防接种。发动一般的清洁卫生运动及环境卫生工作，并注意宣传教育。这样即使有疫病发生，也可能及时扑灭，防止蔓延。
    （四）天花、麻疹、流行性脑脊髓膜炎、白喉、猩红热、百日咳均为急性的呼吸系传染病。其中天花最易预防，只要推行普种牛痘，隔离病人及接触者，消毒病人的分泌物（痰、鼻涕、被服及病人接触过的东西等），即可能奏效。白喉有类毒素，百日咳有菌苗，在七岁以下小孩中，尽可能进行注射，即可达到减少和避免发生。麻疹的预防，可以采取恢复患者或健康人的血五——＋ＣＣ肌肉注射，为预防上述疫病，并应指导人民注意空气流通，身体清洁，多带口罩。在治疗方面，除白喉有白喉抗毒素，流行性脑脊髓膜炎及猩红热可用磺铵及潘尼西林作特效疗法外，最重要的疗法是良好的护理，多吃开水，避风，免致并发其他的疾病。一般并不需更多药品治疗。
    （五）东南各省，因气候较暖，鼠疫已有流行可能，应注意一般的预防工作。在发生疫病地区，主要尤应执行就地隔离病人，封锁疫村，并发动群众大量捕鼠，灭蚤，推行清洁卫生运动，并普遍注射鼠疫菌苗。鼠疫患者如能早期发现是可以治愈的。对鼠疫的病舍消毒，可用克雷沙尔百分之五液喷雾办法，特别以ＤＤＴ消灭跳蚤是重要的，用烧房子的办法来进行病舍消毒是不应再采用了。
    扩大卫生宣传，破除迷信；对封锁区保证物资供应。
    （六）疫区的人民由于长期的迷信习惯，在流行病发生时常有求神拜佛一类举动。巫神僧道及其他游民也必然趁机欺骗，因而引起社会不安及恐慌，以致人民流亡，造成更大的传播机会，必需扩大卫生宣传。结合群众，破除迷信，安定人心。对于发现疫病而被封锁的区域的人民必须由政府大力调剂粮食、菜蔬、燃料及日用品，运入封锁区以保证其适当的物资供应。
    （七）人民解放军各部队，亦应视驻地之不同，针对特殊传染病症进行卫生防疫运动，这种运动不只限于大扫除及预防接种，最重要的是早期发现疫病及即时隔离病人。此外并可进行严格的晨间健康检查制度。加强卫生教育，及组织班排连的基层卫生组织，除部队卫生工作外应尽可能的协助地方防疫卫生工作。
    工作进行中间及结束时，应随时报告情况，各县区发生疫情时应以最快办法上报，直到中央。在每一防疫运动完结之后，须作工作总结，并向上级作综合报告。
