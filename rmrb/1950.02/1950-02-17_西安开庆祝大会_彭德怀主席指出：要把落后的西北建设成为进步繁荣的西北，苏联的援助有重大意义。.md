Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, 16th. Cadres from various Xi'an organizations and people's groups held a meeting at 6 p.m. on the 15th to celebrate the signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance. Chairman Peng Dehuai of the Northwest Military and Political Committee spoke at the meeting. After briefly introducing the basic content of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance and the two agreements, he pointed out: "The signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance, which marks the further unity and cooperation between the nearly 700 million people of China and the Soviet Union, first and foremost gives a head-on blow to the U.S. imperialists' conspiracy to undermine peace in the Far East and the remnant forces of Japanese fascists attempting to revive; those despicable conspiracies that carry out discord and slander regarding Sino-Soviet friendship have been thoroughly defeated. At the same time, the treaty also gives great encouragement to peace-loving and democratic people all over the world.” Chairman Peng said: “People all know that the Soviet Union has long become a strong fortress of world democracy and peace; the liberated Chinese people have already stood up like giants. The strength of cooperation between these two major countries will be forever invincible.” Chairman Peng continued to speak on the great significance of the friendly Soviet Union's economic assistance and economic cooperation to our country in the treaty and agreement: "This is very important, especially to build the backward Northwest into a progressive and prosperous Northwest, so that it can truly assume the responsibility of a rear base for national defense, and Soviet assistance is of even greater significance." Chairman Peng highly praised the brilliant achievements of the Soviet working people in building a new socialist society and moving towards a communist society under the leadership of Lenin and Stalin. He called on the broad masses of people in the Northwest: "We should humbly learn from the rich experience of the Soviet people in building the country. In this way, we believe that on the basis of developing and consolidating Sino-Soviet friendship, we will definitely be able to victoriously complete the great historical task of new democratic construction and victoriously advance towards the socialist road." Chairman Peng then looked back at the historical fact that the friendly Soviet Union has sincerely helped the Chinese people's revolution since the victory of the October Revolution and said: "All this shows that the Soviet Union is a true friend of the Chinese people. The Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance was concluded in accordance with the principles of equality, mutual benefit, mutual respect for national sovereignty and territorial integrity, and non-interference in each other's internal affairs, which more fully demonstrates the great morality of the Soviet Union. Such a treaty is not only absolutely beneficial to the construction cause of the Chinese people, but also has great significance for the cause of peace and democracy in the world. For this reason, we unanimously express our firm support and strive for its thorough realization." Finally, Chairman Peng excitedly led the participating cadres to shout in unison: "Long live the friendly cooperation between the two great powers of China and the Soviet Union!" "Long live Marshal Stalin, the leader of the working people of the world!" "Long live Chairman Mao Zedong, the leader of the Chinese people!"

    彭德怀主席指出：要把落后的西北建设成为进步繁荣的西北，苏联的援助有重大意义。
    【新华社西安十六日电】西安各机关及人民团体干部于十五日下午六时举行大会，庆祝中苏友好同盟互助条约的签订。西北军政委员会彭德怀主席在大会上讲话，他在扼要地介绍了中苏友好同盟互助条约及两个协定的基本内容之后指出：“标志着中苏两国近七万万人民进一步团结合作的中苏友好同盟互助条约的签订，首先是给了美国帝国主义破坏远东和平的阴谋及企图死灰复燃的日本法西斯残余势力以迎头痛击；那些对于中苏友谊实行挑拨离间与造谣污蔑的卑鄙阴谋，已遭到了彻头彻尾的失败。同时，条约也给了全世界爱好和平民主的人民以很大的鼓舞。”彭主席说：“人们都知道，苏联久已成为世界民主和平的坚强堡垒；解放了的中国人民，已经像巨人一样雄伟地站立起来了，这两大国家合作的力量，将是永远无敌的。”彭主席继就条约及协定中友邦苏联对我国的经济援助和经济合作的重大意义说：“这是十分重要的，尤其要把落后的西北建设成为进步的繁荣的西北，使它真正担负起国防后方基地的责任，苏联的援助是更有重大意义的。”彭主席盛赞苏联劳动人民在列宁、斯大林领导下，建设崭新的社会主义社会并走向共产主义社会的光辉成就，他号召大西北广大人民：“我们应该虚心学习苏联人民丰富的建国经验，这样，我们相信在发展和巩固中苏友谊的基础上，一定能够胜利地完成新民主主义建设，并向社会主义道路胜利前进的伟大历史任务。”彭主席继回溯友邦苏联早自十月革命胜利以来，就一贯真诚地帮助中国人民革命的历史事实后说：“这一切都说明了苏联是中国人民的真正朋友。而这次中苏友好同盟互助条约是遵照平等、互利、互相尊重国家主权领土完整及不干涉对方内政的原则订立的，更加充分表现了苏联的伟大道义。这样的条约，不仅对中国人民的建设事业绝对有利，而且对全世界和平民主事业更有其伟大的意义，为此，我们一致表示坚决拥护，并为其彻底实现而奋斗。”最后，彭主席兴奋地领导与会干部一致高呼：“中苏两大国友好合作万岁！”“世界劳动人民领袖斯大林大元帅万岁！”“中国人民领袖毛泽东主席万岁！”
