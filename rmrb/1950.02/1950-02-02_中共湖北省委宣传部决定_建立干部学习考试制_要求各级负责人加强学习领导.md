(Hankou News) The CCP Hubei Provincial Propaganda Department recently issued "The Decision on Resolving Ideological Obstacles to Cadre Study and Establishing a Cadre Study and Examination System." It states initially that the study of the Twelve Documents has basically unfolded within certain organs, and the vast majority of cadres have a high enthusiasm for learning. However, some cadres, even those with greater responsibilities, still do not attach enough importance to theoretical study. They stand outside the circle of the study movement and do not regard leading the cadre study of their unit as one of their responsibilities. They show a somewhat indifferent attitude toward the improvement of the ideological, policy, and theoretical level of the cadres they lead. Their own learning is also mostly superficial, lacking profound and systematic research and understanding. In some areas, there has even been the abnormal phenomenon of older cadres not being as good as newer cadres in learning, and Party members not being as good as League members.

The decision further points out that the reasons for the above phenomena are mainly problems with cadres' attitudes toward learning, which are manifested in the following: First, complacency, thinking that they have been revolutionaries for many years, have a set of struggle experiences, have read some books, and can already cope with work, so there is no need to study hard anymore; second, showing off seniority, unwilling to put down their airs, thinking that they are leading cadres and it is not good to study and argue with ordinary cadres. For example, if some relatively profound and complex questions are raised in the argument and they cannot solve them themselves, it will damage their "face"; third, some cadres of worker and peasant origin feel that they are old, have a lower level of culture and theory, and cannot digest the Twelve Documents, so they give up on themselves, which affects their enthusiasm for learning; fourth, some people are not good at arranging work, and their life system is not sound, so they are busy all day and squeeze out their study time. The last type is afraid of reading, especially thick books, thinking that reading will lead to dogmatism. All of these are ideological obstacles to learning. In the past, cadre study has not been done well, mainly because these ideological obstacles have not been overcome enough.

In order to promote cadres' earnest study of the Twelve Documents, the decision stipulates two tasks, calling on all localities to implement them conscientiously: First, leaders should regularly clear cadres' minds of learning thoughts, especially overcoming the complacency and other incorrect thoughts of old cadres. Second, the cadre study examination will be established as a system. All cadres will be examined once a month, held at the end of the month. Cadres participating in Group A study in provincial-level organs and cadres at the level of the district party committee of each sub-district will be examined by the Propaganda Department of the Provincial Party Committee. The results of the examination will be announced in the "Study Newsletter" and "Hubei Peasants" and "Changjiang Daily" compiled by the General Study Committee. Other cadres at all levels will be examined by the propaganda departments of the Party committees at all levels. After grading, good ones should be commended and given appropriate material rewards (such as books and notebooks), and bad ones should be criticized. The decision finally requires that the local committees report the county and district examination results to the Propaganda Department of the Provincial Party Committee on a monthly basis.

### 中共湖北省委宣传部决定  建立干部学习考试制  要求各级负责人加强学习领导

　　中共湖北省委宣传部决定
    建立干部学习考试制
    要求各级负责人加强学习领导
    【本报讯】汉口消息：中共湖北省委宣传部顷发布《关于解决干部学习思想障碍，建立干部学习考试制度的决定》。首称：十二种文件的学习，在某些机关内已基本展开，绝大多数干部的学习情绪很高；但一部分干部，甚至较负责的干部，对理论学习仍不够重视。他们站在学习运动圈外，没有把领导本单位的干部学习视为自己的责任之一，对于自己所领导的干部在思想、政策、理论水平上的提高，多少表现了漠不关心的态度。他们个人的学习，也多是粗枝大叶，缺乏深刻系统的钻研了解。甚至有的地区产生了在学习上老干部不如新干部，党员不及团员的不正常现象。
    该决定继指出：产生以上现象的原因，主要是干部学习态度有问题，表现为以下几种：一、自满情绪，以为自己已革命多年，有一套斗争经验，什么书都看过一些，已经可以应付工作，用不着再下苦功夫学习；二、摆资格，放不下架子，认为自己是领导干部，不好同一般干部一起学习和互相争论。如争论中提出一些比较深奥复杂的问题，自己不能解决，有损“面子”；三、有些工农出身的干部，则感到年纪老了，文化理论水平又较低，啃不动十二种文件，因而自暴自弃，影响了学习情绪；四、有的人不善于安排工作，生活制度又不健全，成天忙乱，把学习时间挤掉了。最后一种是怕读书，特别怕读厚本书，认为读书就会犯教条主义的错误。凡此种种，都是学习上的思想障碍。过去干部学习没能搞好，主要原因是对这些思想障碍克服得不够。
    为推动干部认真学好十二本文件，该决定规定了两项工作，号召各地认真执行：一、领导上应经常打通干部的学习思想，特别是克服老干部的自满等不正确思想。二、将干部学习考试定为制度，所有干部每月考一次，月底举行。省级机关参加甲组学习之干部及各分区地委一级干部，由省委宣传部出题考试，考试结果在总学委会所编之《学习通讯》及《湖北农民》、《长江日报》上予以公布。其他各级干部，由各级党委宣传部出题考验。评卷后，好的应予表扬，在物质上给以适当奖励（如奖以书籍笔记本等），坏的应予批评。该决定最后要求各地委将县区考试结果，按月报告省委宣传部。
