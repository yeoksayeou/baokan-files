Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 24th – The 21st Government Administration Council meeting of the Central People's Government passed an order to be issued to the People's Governments (or Military and Administrative Committees) of all major administrative regions and the People's Governments of all municipalities directly under the Central Government, strictly prohibiting opium and narcotics. The full text is as follows:

Order of the Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government Strictly Prohibiting Opium and Narcotics

To the People's Governments (or Military and Administrative Committees) of all major administrative regions and the People's Governments of all municipalities directly under the Central Government:

For more than a hundred years since the imperialists invaded our country and forced the import of opium, it has been a scourge to our country. Due to the reactionary rule of feudal compradors and bureaucratic warlords, along with their licentious and shameless corrupt lives, they not only did not prohibit opium, but instead forced its cultivation. Especially under the invasion of Japanese imperialism, they systematically implemented the poisoning of China, thus killing countless people and depleting the people's property. Now that the people of the whole country have been liberated, in order to protect the people's health and restore and develop production, the following measures are specifically stipulated to strictly prohibit opium, narcotics, and other drugs:

1.  People's Governments at all levels should cooperate with people's organizations to conduct extensive anti-opium and anti-narcotics propaganda, mobilizing the people to take united action. In areas where opium and narcotics are prevalent, people's representative conferences or people's congresses at all levels should discuss the work of anti-opium and anti-narcotics as a special topic, and set out measures to eradicate them within a limited time.

2.  In order to ensure the smooth progress of the anti-opium and anti-narcotics work, People's Governments at all levels may establish anti-opium and anti-narcotics committees. The committee shall be organized by personnel from the government's civil affairs and public security departments and various people's organizations, with the civil affairs department responsible for the organization.

3.  In areas where military operations have completely ended, opium cultivation should be prohibited from the spring of 1950; in areas where military operations have not yet completely ended, opium cultivation should be prohibited immediately upon the end of military operations. Particular attention should be paid to earnestly implementing the prohibition before sowing. In some minority areas where opium is cultivated, prudent measures should be taken in light of the actual local conditions to gradually prohibit cultivation.

4.  From the date of promulgation of this prohibition, no one throughout the country shall be allowed to transport, manufacture, or sell opium and narcotics. Offenders, regardless of who they are, shall be severely punished in addition to confiscation of their opium and narcotics.

5.  Opium and narcotics scattered among the people should be ordered to be surrendered within a time limit. Our People's Government may provide appropriate compensation in consideration of their livelihood. Those who fail to surrender within the time limit shall be punished according to the seriousness of their circumstances, in addition to being investigated and confiscated.

6.  People who smoke or use narcotics are required to register within a time limit (register with the public security bureau in cities and with the People's Government in rural areas) and quit regularly. Those who conceal their addiction and fail to quit after the deadline will be punished after investigation.

7.  Health authorities of People's Governments at all levels should prepare opium-quitting medicines and publicize opium-quitting and detoxification prescriptions, and provide free or reduced-price treatment for poor addicts. Cities with a high prevalence of opium and narcotics may set up drug rehabilitation centers. The supply of opium-quitting and detoxification drugs should be uniformly controlled by health authorities to strictly prevent covert forms of opium and narcotic substitutes.

8.  The People's Governments (or Military and Administrative Committees) of all major administrative regions and the People's Governments of all municipalities directly under the Central Government shall, according to the situation in their respective regions and based on the principles of this prohibition, formulate investigation and prohibition measures and dates for eradicating cultivation and addiction, and submit them to the Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government for approval and implementation. After approval, they shall print and issue public announcements to carry out extensive and in-depth publicity and education work.

It is hoped that you will execute and transfer the order to your subordinates to comply with.

Hereby ordered,

                Premier Zhou Enlai
              February 24, 1950

　　保护人民健康恢复与发展生产
    政务院通令严禁鸦片毒品
    【新华社北京二十四日电】中央人民政府政务院第二十一次政务会议通过向各大行政区人民政府（或军政委员会）及中央直辖各省市人民政府发出严禁鸦片烟毒的通令，全文如下：
    中央人民政府政务院严禁鸦片烟毒的通令
    令各大行政区人民政府（或军政委员会）中央直辖各省市人民政府
    自帝国主义侵略我国，强迫输入鸦片，为害我国已百有余年。由于封建买办的官僚军阀的反动统治，与其荒淫无耻的腐烂生活，对于烟毒，不但不禁止，反而强迫种植，尤其在日本帝国主义侵略下，曾有计划的实行毒化中国，因此戕杀人民生命，损耗人民财产，不可胜数。现在全国人民已得解放，为了保护人民健康，恢复与发展生产，特规定严禁鸦片烟毒及其他毒品的办法如下：
    一、各级人民政府应协同人民团体，作广泛的禁烟禁毒宣传，动员人民起来一致行动。在烟毒较盛地区，各级人民代表会议或人民代表大会，应把禁烟禁毒工作作为专题讨论，定出限期禁绝办法。
    二、各级人民政府为使禁烟禁毒工作进行顺利，得设禁烟禁毒委员会。该会由政府民政、公安部门及各人民团体派员组织，民政部门负组织之责。
    三、在军事已完全结束地区，从一九五○年春起应禁绝种烟；在军事尚未完全结束地区，军事一经结束，立即禁绝种烟，尤应注意在播种之前认真执行。在某些少数民族地区如有种烟者，应斟酌当地实际情况，采取慎重措施，有步骤地进行禁种。
    四、从本禁令颁布之日起，全国各地不许再有贩运制造及售卖烟土毒品情事。犯者不论何人，除没收其烟土毒品外，还须从严治罪。
    五、散存于民间之烟土毒品，应限期令其缴出。我人民政府为照顾其生活，得分别酌予补偿。如逾期不缴出者，除查出没收外，并应按其情节轻重分别治罪。
    六、吸食烟毒的人民限期登记（城市向公安局，乡村向人民政府登记），并定期戒除。隐不登记者，逾期而犹未戒除者查出后予以处罚。
    七、各级人民政府卫生机关，应配制戒烟药品，及宣传戒烟戒毒药方，对贫苦瘾民得免费或减价医治。烟毒较盛的城市，得设戒烟所。戒烟戒毒药品的供应，应由卫生机关统一掌握，严防隐蔽形式的烟毒代用品。
    八、各大行政区人民政府（或军政委员会）、中央直辖省、市人民政府，各按本地区情况，依据本禁令方针，制定查禁办法及禁绝种吸日期，呈报中央人民政府政务院批准施行。并于批淮后，印发布告，进行广泛深入的宣传教育工作。
    希即依照执行并转令所属遵照
    此令
                总理  周恩来
              一九五○年二月二十四日
