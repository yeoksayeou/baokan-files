　　Hebei Province Supply and Marketing Cooperative Conference
    Unifying the Division of Foreign Sales Markets, Purchasing and Promoting Products from Disaster Victims
    [Report from this newspaper in Baoding] In order to implement the resolutions of the Hebei Provincial Economic Conference on carrying out the supply and marketing cooperative movement and strengthening production and disaster relief work, the Hebei Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative held a conference of directors of special district cooperatives in mid-January. In addition to arranging the work of transferring seeds and fertilizers in non-disaster areas to prepare for spring plowing, it also studied the methods for completing the tasks of purchasing, exchanging, lending grain, and selling on behalf of the state-owned companies as negotiated with the state-owned companies. A specific work plan for pre-wheat harvest was immediately formulated, organizing disaster victims to develop diversified production in exchange for grain, coal, and production raw materials (such as yarn and cotton). The association first strengthened its leadership over production by actively establishing cooperatives through the development of business. It is required to develop 2 million members in the province before the wheat harvest. In terms of major business, it was decided to purchase 2.31 million bolts of homespun cloth and 141,000 bolts of coarse cloth before the wheat harvest to supply 7,250 pieces of 10-count yarn and 3,750 pieces of 20-count yarn. At the same time, in order to implement production and disaster relief and organize non-disaster areas to support disaster areas, it was decided to focus on purchasing homespun cloth in disaster areas to support textile production in disaster areas. The foreign sales markets for homespun cloth in each special district were divided: it was determined that the Tianjin, Tangshan, Cangxian, and Hengshui special districts would promote sales to the Northeast, the Dingxian, Shijiazhuang, and Baoding special districts would promote sales to central Shanxi and Chahar-Suiyuan, the Tongxian special district would promote sales to the Northwest, and Handan and Xingtai would promote sales to southern Shanxi and Shaanxi. According to the situation that the province may produce 120 million catties of hides before wheat harvest, it was decided to purchase 45 million catties; the rest will be organized for the masses to sell themselves. In addition, 140,000 mats, 140,000 catties of straw braid, 100,000 pockets, 2.4 million catties of white oil, and pig bristles and casings were also purchased. In order to complete the above tasks, it was decided that the provincial cooperative and the special district cooperatives should adopt the policy of unified planning, unified management, and unified foreign affairs in business operations. In addition to retaining a portion of funds to operate businesses necessary for production in their respective regions, the working capital of each special district shall be managed and allocated uniformly by the provincial cooperative to ensure the completion of business. All levels of cooperatives and state-owned trading companies should overcome the purely profit-seeking viewpoint, conscientiously improve product quality, and implement small profits and quick sales. Since the conference of directors of special district cooperatives, each special district has convened a conference of directors of county cooperatives. Contracts are being widely signed to purchase products from disaster areas. In conjunction with the leadership of party and government at all levels, all transportation forces are being mobilized to actively transfer grain and coal. In January, each special district purchased 4.11 million catties of hides, and the provincial cooperative purchased 170,000 bolts of homespun cloth, 13,600 bolts of coarse cloth, and 300,000 mats. All of these were sold in Beijing, Tianjin, and the Northwest.
