　　Widely Organize the Masses to Promote Universal Education
　　The Capital Establishes Adult Night Schools
　　Enrollment Reaches Over 15,000 People
　　Mobilization is Relatively Thorough, Students Actively Study
　　[Our Newspaper] Beijing Municipality has achieved considerable success in running adult night schools. According to statistics at the end of December last year, 182 adult night schools have been established, with 423 classes and more than 15,400 students, which is about eight times that of September last year (before the large-scale expansion). The main components of adult night school students are urban poor, independent laborers, shop assistants, and housewives (workers form separate worker night schools, which are directly led by the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions). This work is led by the Education Work Committee, jointly composed of the Municipal Education Bureau, the Municipal Propaganda Department, the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, the Municipal Women's Federation, the Youth League, the Education Union, and the Municipal Public Security Bureau. The focus is on cultural education, but some political education is also appropriately conducted.
　　Since the educational targets of adult night schools are mostly unorganized masses, there were various concerns and different views about night schools at the beginning. Some said that learning to read was not as important as corn flour, some suspected that going to night school would make them go south, and women had more concerns. In order to dispel these concerns, local police stations, cultural and educational sections, women's committees, primary and secondary school principals, and teachers combined their efforts and used various methods and opportunities to conduct extensive publicity and mobilization among the masses, such as street speeches, performing dramas (the pain of illiteracy), holding neighborhood head meetings, meetings of family members of military personnel, or through central tasks such as household registration and epidemic prevention, and mobilizing through active elements among the masses. This gradually achieved considerable results. For example, after mobilizing active elements in one section of the Tenth District, they brought more than 100 students on the second day, all from the same class. After mobilization in the Third District, the number of students increased from more than 900 to more than 2,700.
　　Due to the relatively thorough mobilization, most students are highly motivated to learn. The Third District Adult Night School has now sold more than 1,000 copies of the "Temporary Textbook for Adult Night Schools," and many more are buying them. Women students in the adult night school in this district account for 40 percent, most of whom are illiterate or know few characters. After three months of study, they can generally recognize more than 300 characters.
　　Most adult night schools have established school affairs committees, designated special personnel to be responsible, absorbed active elements among the students to participate, and organized many students to participate in school affairs and management. The Zuo'anmen Night School in the Tenth District mobilized students through the school affairs committee and completely solved the problem of desks and chairs. Students at the Sixteenth Police Station in the Ninth District made their own blackboards and found places. Some night schools have established systems of roll call, testing, and rewards on the basis of students' self-awareness. Generally, they are organized into study groups according to residential areas, with group leaders to supervise and grasp learning discipline and manage daily life. The length of schooling, teaching materials, courses, and class times cannot be completely consistent. Some schools in the Third and Tenth Districts have female students taking classes during the day; some newly established night schools do not have six classes a week; some night schools have a large proportion of cultural courses, but some higher-level grades focus more on political classes. In terms of class division, some night schools are divided into political and cultural classes, while others are divided into high, middle, and primary levels according to cultural level. The vendors in the Tenth District, because they do not have regular time, are organized to study and discuss by themselves, and are given assistance at a certain time. These are all determined according to various different situations and the specific requirements of different students. In the future, when material conditions are gradually improved, they can gradually move towards standardization.
　　In terms of teaching, since most of the teachers are college and high school students, their teaching experience is poor, and teaching is easily divorced from reality. In order to overcome this shortcoming, some districts (such as the Third District) first strengthen the political and professional learning of teachers, combine with the teaching center of each stage to formulate outlines, organize them to study and discuss, so that teachers are prepared before teaching, and the lectures are better.
　　In order to overcome the difficulty of uneven levels, some night schools in the Ninth District (taught by normal university students) have established a tutoring system. That is, one teacher teaches the class, and at the same time one or two teachers tutor individual students with poor levels, so that they can catch up with the general progress. Because teachers are not full-time, they may be absent from class due to important matters. In order to overcome this difficulty, the Ninth District Adult Education Committee has a batch of mobile teachers. Wherever a teacher is temporarily absent, a mobile teacher is immediately sent to supplement. They use this method to ensure that none of the nineteen night schools have collapsed from the beginning to the present. In the absence of sufficient professional night school teachers today, this is still a way to deal with emergencies. (Jiang Xia)

　　广泛组织群众推行普及教育
    首都创办成人夜校
    入学人数已达万五千余人
    动员比较深入学员积极学习
    【本报讯】北京市举办成人夜校，已获相当成绩。据去年十二月底统计，成人夜校已成立一百八十二处，四百二十三班，一万五千四百多人，约等于去年九月（大开展以前）的八倍。成人夜校学员的主要成份，是城市贫民、独立劳动者、店员及家庭妇女（工人另组工人夜校，由市总工会直接领导）。此项工作，由市教育局、市委宣传部、市总工会、市妇联、青年团、教联和市公安局共同组成的教育工作委员会领导。着重点是文化教育，但也适当进行一些政治教育。
    由于成人夜校的教育对象多属没有组织的群众，起初对夜校有各种顾虑与不同的看法。有的说学识字没有棒子面要紧，有的怀疑入夜校会让自己南下，妇女的顾虑更多。为解除这些顾虑，各区派出所、文教科、妇委会、中、小学校长、教员们曾结合起来，利用各种方式和机会对群众进行广泛的宣传动员，如街头演讲，表演话剧（不识字的痛苦），开闾长会、军属代表会，或通过清查户口、防疫等中心工作，通过群众中的积极分子进行动员，这样逐渐收到相当效果。如第十区的一个段在动员了积极分子以后，第二天他们就带起来一百多学员，都是同阶层的。第三区经过动员，由原有的九百多人发展到两千七百多人。
    由于动员比较深入，一般学员学习的积极性都比较高。第三区成人夜校，现已卖出“成人夜校临时课本”一千多册，还有许多人正在购买。该区成人夜校妇女学员占百分之四十，大多数是文盲或识少数字，经过三个月学习，一般都能认到三百多字。
    大多数成人夜校已建立了校务委员会，指定专人负责，吸收学员中的积极分子参加，并组织了不少学员参加学校的事务与管理工作。十区左安门夜校通过校委会发动学员，全部解决了桌椅家具问题。九区第十六派出所学员自己做黑板，找地方。有些夜校已在学员自觉的基础上建立了点名、测验和奖励等制度。并且一般的都按居住地区编成学习小组，由小组长督促和掌握学习纪律，管理日常生活。在学制、教材、课程与上课时间上不能完全一致。三区、十区有些学校的女学员采取白天上课；有些刚建立的夜校一星期上不到六次课；有些夜校文化课占比重大，但有些水平较高的年级则多讲政治课。分班方面，有的夜校分成政治、文化两班，有的则按文化程度分为高、中、初三级。十区的摊贩们因为没有整时间，便把他们组织起来自学、讨论，到一定时期给以帮助。这些，都是根据各种不同情况和不同学员的具体要求决定的。将来在物质条件逐渐改善之后，当可逐步走向正规。
    教学方面，由于教员多是大中学生，教学经验较差，教学时很容易和实际脱节。为克服这种缺点，有的区（如三区）便首先加强教员的政治和业务学习，结合每一阶段的教学中心拟定提纲，组织他们学习和讨论，使教员在教学以前有所准备，就讲得比较好些。
    为克服程度不齐的困难，九区有些夜校（师大学生教的）建立了辅导制。即由一个教员教课，下面同时有一两个教员对个别程度较差的学员加以辅导，使他们能够赶上一般的进度。因为教员不是专职，有时会因要事而缺课。为克服这一困难，九区成人教委会掌握了一批机动教员。什么地方教员临时缺课，马上就由机动教员去补充。他们采用这种办法，使十九夜校从开始到现在没有一个垮台的。在没有足够的专业夜校教员的今天，还不失为一个救急的办法。（江夏）
