Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 12th -- TASS, Sofia, 10th: The draft Bulgarian budget for 1950 totals 211,366,000,000 leva (approximately $730 million). Sixty-five percent of the budget is allocated to economic, social, and cultural needs, with only seven percent for national defense. The new budget vividly demonstrates the peace-loving policy of the Bulgarian Republic and the creative efforts of the working people, and remarkably showcases the comprehensive development of production capacity, the government's increasing concern for the welfare of the working people, and the consolidation of the freedom and independence of the People's Republic of Bulgaria.

Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 12th -- TASS, Warsaw, 11th: Polish Finance Minister Dąbrowski presented the draft Polish budget for 1950 at the 75th session of the Polish Parliament. The total budget amounts to 843 billion złoty (approximately $2.1 billion), an increase of nearly 213 billion złoty, or 35 percent, compared to last year. The main source of the budget increase is the higher profits obtained from the increasing industrial and agricultural production and state-owned industries and agriculture.

This year, the funds allocated to basic construction are 121.4 billion złoty more than last year. The budget stipulates the allocation of large sums for cultural and educational expenses. Due to the exemption of tuition fees, parents of students will save 1.8 billion złoty. The number of teachers paid from the state budget will increase by 12,500 compared to last year. In addition, 3.6 billion złoty has been allocated for student scholarships in higher education institutions (2 billion złoty last year); nearly 4.5 billion złoty has been allocated for vocational training.

If combined with the budgets of local governments for social insurance and basic construction subsidy programs, the total state budget amounts to 1,265.8 billion złoty (approximately $3.1 billion), of which 550.4 billion złoty (43.5 percent) is allocated to the development of the national economy, 412.4 billion (32.6 percent) is allocated to education, science, culture, health, and social insurance needs, 129.7 billion (10.2 percent) is for national defense and national security expenses, administrative expenses are 10.12 billion (8 percent), and other expenses are 72.1 billion (5.7 percent).

Finance Minister Dąbrowski pointed out that last year, income from the socialized economy accounted for 60 percent of the total budget revenue, while this year it has risen to 75 percent. Therefore, in terms of both direction and structure, the 1950 budget is socialist.

Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 12th -- TASS, Berlin, 11th: The Provisional People's Chamber of the German Democratic Republic unanimously adopted the government's draft national budget for 1950 at its 11th plenary session. This year's revenue of the republic and states will increase by 10 percent compared to last year, reaching 17.63 billion marks. The increased revenue is stipulated to come from the rapid development of the public sector of the economy, rather than increasing income taxes on wages and salaries. Due to the increase in revenue, this year's budget revenue exceeds expenditure by 104.8 million marks. This shows that the economy of the German Democratic Republic is progressing without relying on foreign debt. The situation in West Germany is exactly the opposite, with foreign debt already reaching 1.3 billion West German marks.

Republic Government Finance Minister Loch told the People's Chamber that this year's reparations payments have decreased by 47 percent compared to 1949, and occupation costs have decreased by 50 percent.

　　满足经济文化社会建设需要
    保波制订今年预算草案 
    波兰预算中社会化经济部分收入上升
    民主德国预算收入超过支出
    【新华社北京十二日电】塔斯社索非亚十日讯：保加利亚一九五○年预算草案总额为二一一、三六六、○○○、○○○利瓦（约合七亿三千万美元）。预算的百分之六十五指拨于经济、社会和文化需要，仅百分之七用于国防。新预算生动地表明了保加利亚共和国的爱好和平政策及劳动人民的创造性努力，并卓越地显示了生产能力的全面发展，政府对劳动人民福利的日益增加的关怀和保加利亚人民共和国的自由与独立的巩固。
    【新华社北京十二日电】塔斯社华沙十一日讯：波兰财政部长顿布劳斯基在波兰议会第七十五次会议上提出波兰一九五○年度预算草案。预算总额为八千四百三十亿兹罗提（约合二十一亿美元），较去年增加将近二千一百三十亿兹罗提，或百分之三十五。预算增加的主要来源，是靠日益增加的工农业生产及国营工业与农业所获得的较高利润。
    今年指拨于基本建设的款项较去年多一千二百一十四亿兹罗提。预算规定指拨大宗款项作文化教育费用。由于学费的免除，学生家长将节省十八亿兹罗提。从国家预算中支薪的教师人数，将较去年增加一万二千五百名。另外指拨了三十六亿兹罗提作为高等教育机关的学生奖学金（去年为二十亿兹罗提）；指拨了将近四十五亿兹罗提作为职业训练之用。
    如与各地方政府的社会保险及基本建设补助计划的预算加在一起，国家预算总额共达一万二千六百五十八亿兹罗提（约合三十一亿美元），其中五千五百另四亿兹罗提（百分之四十三点五）指拨于发展国民经济，四千一百二十四亿（百分之三十二点六）指拨于教育、科学、文化、卫生与社会保险需要，一千二百九十七亿（百分之十点二）为国防及国家治安费用，行政费用一千另一十二亿（百分之八），其他开支七百二十一亿（百分之五点七）。
    财长顿布劳斯基指出，去年来自社会化经济部分的收入占总预算总收入的百分之六十，而今年则上升为百分之七十五，因此不论就方向及结构来说，一九五○年度预算都是属于社会主义的。
    【新华社北京十二日电】塔斯社柏林十一日讯：德意志民主共和国临时人民议会第十一次全体会议，一致通过政府一九五○年度的国家预算草案。本年度共和国与州的岁入，将较去年增加百分之十，而达一百七十六亿三千万马克。规定增加的岁入，将得自公营经济部分的迅速发展，而不是提高对工资与薪金的所得税。由于岁入的增加，本年度预算的收入超过支出一亿零四百八十万马克。这显示德意志民主共和国的经济，正在向前进展而无需依靠外债。西德的情形则恰恰相反，外债已达十三亿西德马克。
    共和国政府财政部长洛赫向人民议会称：本年度的赔款支付，较一九四九年减少百分之四十七，占领费用减少百分之五十。
