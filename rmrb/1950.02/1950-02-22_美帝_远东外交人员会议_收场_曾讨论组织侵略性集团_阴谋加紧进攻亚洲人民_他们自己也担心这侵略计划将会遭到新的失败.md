Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 20th – The "US Far East Diplomats Conference," which opened on the 13th in Bangkok, the capital of Thailand, concluded on the 15th. All meetings were conducted in extreme secrecy. According to the official communiqué issued by the United States Information Service and statements by participating delegates: On the first day of the conference (the 13th), Assistant Secretary of State for Far Eastern Affairs, Butterworth, explained the State Department's views on formulating an aggressive policy in the Far East, followed by Jessup's report on the results of the so-called "special group" of the State Department's study since last August on how to invade the Far East and Southeast Asia. The American diplomatic representatives attending the meeting reported to the conference on the intelligence they had collected in their host countries. The second day of the meeting discussed the "Asian Military Alliance," the conclusion of a separate peace treaty with Japan, and the implementation of political and economic aggression through the "Point Four Program." On the third day of the meeting, concrete measures to provide immediate military and economic assistance to the reactionaries in East Asian countries were further discussed.

Regarding the "Asian Military Alliance," the Associated Press quoted Jessup's statement on the 14th as saying: "The United States does not initiate an Asian military alliance, but if Asian countries themselves unite to form a military alliance, the United States will express sympathy." Jessup's statement indicates that in order to intensify its attacks on the national liberation movements in the East, US imperialism has decided to organize an aggressive bloc in the Far East, but in order to conceal its shameful role in organizing this alliance, it has decided to instigate its puppets in Asian countries to organize this alliance. Quirino, the running dog of US imperialism, recently returned to the Philippines after hearing orders from Washington and is actively working to establish a "Pacific Union," which is the concrete implementation of this despicable plan of US imperialism. Regarding the "Point Four Program," Reuters reported that the Bangkok meeting discussed the establishment of a liaison organization so that, through this organization, the "Point Four Program" could be coordinated with the British Commonwealth's economic "aid" plan for Asia, as decided at the Colombo Conference. One of the delegates attending the meeting told a Reuters reporter: "The entire East Asia urgently needs guns and dollars, and they must be paid quickly." But he went on to say that only countries that can "most honestly devote themselves to helping us help them" will be able to enjoy "priority" on the "aid" list. According to a Washington dispatch from the Associated Press on the 17th, the US State Department and the Department of Defense are preparing to recommend that this "priority" be given to the reactionaries in Indonesia, Vietnam, Thailand, and India, so that they can form "a line of defense" against the people's liberation movements in Asian countries.

Although the American conspirators who participated in the Bangkok meeting expressed in the meeting their conspiracy to strengthen their hostility to the people of Asian countries, they also expressed a lack of confidence in whether this aggressive plan could avoid new failures. United Press International repeatedly revealed that some American diplomats stationed in Asia expressed hesitation about the United States continuing to adopt a "strong policy" in Asia, because "they are afraid that the United States may eventually have to retreat" and "lose more face in the East."

After the Bangkok meeting, Jessup will continue to travel to India, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Egypt, London, Paris, and other places before returning to the United States. Butterworth will also stop in London on his way back to the United States to consult with British officials. After Jessup and Butterworth return to the United States, they will report the results of the Bangkok meeting to Truman and the State Department in order to finalize the new US aggression plan for the Far East and Southeast Asia.

　　美帝“远东外交人员会议”收场
    曾讨论组织侵略性集团  阴谋加紧进攻亚洲人民
    他们自己也担心这侵略计划将会遭到新的失败
    【新华社北京二十日电】十三日在泰国首都曼谷召开的“美国远东外交人员会议”已于十五日结束。全部会议都是极端秘密地进行的。据美国新闻处所发表的官方公报及与会代表透露：会议第一日（十三日）由美国国务院负责远东事务的助理国务卿白德华说明国务院对制订远东侵略政策的意见，继由耶塞普报告国务院的所谓“特别小组”自去年八月以来研究如何侵略远东及东南亚问题的结果。出席会议的美国外交代表均向大会报告了他们在驻在国所搜集的情报。会议第二日讨论了“亚洲军事联盟”、单独对日缔结和约及通过“第四点计划”进行政治、经济侵略等问题。会议的第三日，即进而讨论了立即给予东亚各国反动派以军事与经济援助的具体措施。
    关于“亚洲军事联盟”问题，据美联社引耶塞普十四日声明称：“美国不发起一个亚洲军事联盟，但是如果亚洲国家自己联合组织一个军事联盟的话，美国将表同情。”耶塞普这一声明表示：美帝国主义为了加紧对东方各民族解放运动的进攻，已决定在远东组织一个侵略性集团，但为了掩盖它在组织这个联盟中的可耻作用，决定策动它在亚洲国家中的傀儡来组织这个联盟。美帝国主义的走卒季里诺最近从华盛顿听取命令回到菲律宾以后，即积极活动成立“太平洋联盟”，就是美帝国主义这一卑鄙计划的具体实施。关于“第四点计划”，据路透社称：曼谷会议曾讨论成立一个联络机构，以便经由这个机构，使“第四点计划”与科伦坡会议上所决定的不列颠联邦对亚洲的经济“援助”计划，互相配合。出席会议的一个代表对路透社记者称：“整个东亚迫切需要枪枝与美元，而且要很快付给。”但是他接着说，只有能“最诚实地舍身协助我们帮助他们的国家”，才能在“援助”名单上享受“优先权”。据美联社华盛顿十七日消息透露，美国国务院及国防部正准备建议，将这种“优先权”给予印尼、越南、泰国和印度的反动派，使他们结成“一条警备线”，以反对亚洲各国的人民解放运动。
    参加曼谷会议的美国阴谋家们，虽然在会议中表示了他们将加强与亚洲各国人民为敌的阴谋，但对于这种侵略计划能否免遭新的失败，也表示缺乏信心。合众社一再透露：美国驻在亚洲的某些外交人员，对美国在亚洲继续采取“强烈的政策”，表示犹豫，原因是“他们恐怕美国终久可能不得不退却”并“在东方进一步丢面子”。
    曼谷会议结束后，耶塞普将继续到印度、巴基斯坦、阿富汗、埃及、伦敦、巴黎等地活动，然后返美，白德华在返美途中亦将在伦敦停留，以便与英国官方有所咨商。耶塞普、白德华返美后，将向杜鲁门及国务院报告曼谷会议的结果，以便最后确定美国对远东与东南亚的新侵略计划。
