Among the more than 700 people who attended this grand celebration banquet were Vice Chairmen of the Central People's Government Zhu De, Li Jishen, and Zhang Lan, Secretary-General Lin Boqu, Vice Premiers of the Government Administration Council Dong Biwu, Chen Yun, Guo Moruo, and Huang Yanpei, President of the Supreme People's Court Shen Junru, Vice Ministers of Foreign Affairs Li Kenong and Zhang Hanfu, Mayor of Beijing Nie Rongzhen, as well as Soviet Chargé d'Affaires S.P. Tevosyan, Czech Ambassador Weiskopf, Korean Ambassador Li Zhouyuan, Polish Chargé d'Affaires B.Bierut, Hungarian Minister Sifaranko, and other members of these embassies, as well as Ayonuo, head of the Indonesian Trade Union Federation delegation. The celebration evening began in an atmosphere of excitement and warmth. After Secretary-General Lin Boqu delivered a brief opening speech, the band played the national anthems of China and the Soviet Union. Vice Chairman Liu Shaoqi, Soviet Embassy Chargé d'Affaires Mr. S.P. Tevosyan, Vice Chairman Zhu De, Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Li Kenong, Vice Chairman Li Jishen, Vice Premier Guo Moruo, President Shen Junru, Vice Premier Huang Yanpei, and Vice Chairman of the All-China Democratic Women's Federation Deng Yingchao delivered speeches successively.

Vice Chairman Liu Shaoqi said: The signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance has given China a great ally that it has never had in its history, thereby consolidating the victory that the Chinese people have already achieved.

Mr. S.P. Tevosyan said: The signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance has opened a new page in the friendly relations between the two great nations of China and the Soviet Union. It is a great practical proof of the lofty principles of the foreign policy of the Soviet socialist state.

Vice Chairman Zhu De said: The Chinese people, who have suffered from war damage for a long time, have received great assistance from the Soviet Union, which will undoubtedly have a significant effect on the restoration and development of the new Chinese economy.

Vice Minister Li Kenong said: The signing of this treaty conforms to the ardent wishes of the people of China and the Soviet Union, and will inevitably receive their enthusiastic support and endorsement.

Vice Chairman Li Jishen said in his speech on behalf of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang: The signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance is not only a great happy event for China and the Soviet Union, but also a great happy event for all peace-loving mankind in the world. Through this treaty, the 700 million people of China and the Soviet Union will be more closely united for justice and world peace. This treaty is an unprecedented gospel in the world.

Vice Premier Guo Moruo said in his speech on behalf of non-party democratic figures: The significance of this great and solemn treaty is that the people of China and the Soviet Union will jointly prevent the resurgence of Japanese imperialism, jointly prevent any acts of aggression launched by imperialism in collusion with Japanese imperialism, and jointly defend lasting world peace. Let the remnants of Japanese imperialism and the mad and arrogant warmonger American imperialism tremble before this treaty.

President Shen Junru said in his speech on behalf of the China Democratic League: This great assistance from the Soviet Union will not only never be forgotten by the Chinese people, but will also not be forgotten by the people of all Eastern countries, because this treaty greatly consolidates lasting international peace in the Pacific, making Japanese fascists and all aggressors who collude with Japanese fascists have to retreat in the face of difficulties. I believe that from now on, peace in the Far East and the Pacific is indeed guaranteed. For this, on behalf of the China Democratic League, I would like to first thank Marshal Stalin and the Soviet people under his leadership.

Vice Premier Huang Yanpei said in his speech on behalf of the China Democratic National Construction Association: The significance of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance cannot be fully described by the two words "Sino-Soviet friendship." This treaty is not only a declaration to stop the aggression of Japanese imperialism and any countries that collude with Japan, but also a guarantee for maintaining world peace.

Vice Chairman Deng Yingchao, on behalf of the All-China Democratic Women's Federation and Chinese women, warmly celebrated the signing of this treaty. She said: This treaty has brought infinite encouragement and strength to the Chinese people, and it has also brought great inspiration to peace-loving and democratic people around the world.

All the speakers warmly praised the wise leadership of the great teacher of peace-loving people around the world, Marshal Stalin, and the great leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao Zedong. The guests and hosts repeatedly stood up to toast these two great leaders.

After the banquet, there were wonderful dance performances to add to the fun, and it did not end until late at night.
