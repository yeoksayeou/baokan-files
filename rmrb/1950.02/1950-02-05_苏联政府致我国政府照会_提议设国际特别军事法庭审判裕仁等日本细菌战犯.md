　　Soviet Government Note to Our Government
    Proposing the Establishment of an International Special Military Tribunal to Try Hirohito and Other Japanese Germ Warfare Criminals
    【Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, February 4th】Li Kenong, Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China, received on February 1st a note from the Soviet Government to our government delivered by S.P. Titov, Chargé d'Affaires of the Soviet Embassy in China. The full text of the note is as follows:
    Mr. Deputy Minister:
    I have the honor, on behalf of the Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, to make the following notification:
    The Military Tribunal of the Primorsky Krai of the Soviet Union publicly tried Yamada, Takahashi, Kajitsuka, and other Japanese war criminals from December 25th to 29th, 1949, and confirmed that the ruling group headed by Japanese Emperor Hirohito had secretly prepared for germ warfare for many years—one of the most inhumane weapons of aggression.
    In their heinous plan to prepare for wars of aggression against peace-loving people, Japanese militarists planned to use bacteriological weapons on a large scale to exterminate troops and peaceful residents, including the elderly, women, and children, by spreading plague, cholera, typhoid, gas gangrene, anthrax, and other terrible and deadly infectious diseases.
    In the bacteriological units of the Japanese army, specially organized under the orders of Japanese Emperor Hirohito and the tasks of the Japanese Ministry of the Army and the General Staff, deadly bacteria of plague, cholera, typhoid, and anthrax, as well as other dangerous infectious germs, were cultivated in large quantities, shells and tools for spreading bacteria were manufactured, and special forces were trained to massively infect residents, reservoirs, houses, sown fields, and livestock.
    These agencies were highly confidential and, for the sake of disguise, were named "Water Supply and Disease Prevention Bureau of the Kwantung Army" and "Veterinary Infectious Disease Experimental Bureau of the Kwantung Army." Later, they were renamed "Unit 731" and "Unit 100." These two units had many detachments subordinate to the Kwantung Army detachments, each stationed in the main attack directions marked in the Japanese anti-Soviet war plan.
    "Unit 731" was stationed 20 kilometers away from Harbin, in a small town specially built in the Pingfang railway station area, and the entire small town was declared a military restricted zone. The unit had 3,000 scientific and technical personnel and possessed a large number of laboratories and powerful equipment for mass production of bacteria to ensure the possibility of large-scale germ warfare.
    The trial confirmed that these units consisted of five departments, and only one of these departments, the third department, was engaged in the unit's public business, namely, managing the unit's water supply. This department was openly stationed in Harbin City, not within the aforementioned specially defended military restricted area. All other four departments were specially engaged in issues related to the preparation and conduct of germ warfare.
    The first department, named the Research Department, was engaged in the research and cultivation of deadly bacteria, and selected from them the types considered most effective as bacteriological weapons.
    The second department, the Experiment Department, was engaged in testing the effectiveness of various bacteria on living people, and designing bombs and methods for infecting enemy areas with bacteria. In this department, there were 4,500 breeding grounds specially breeding fleas for spreading plague. In order to carry out criminal experiments using the air force to help use germ warfare tools, the department had a dedicated target range and air force unit near Andong railway station.
    The fourth department was the so-called Production Department, whose task was to mass-produce the most effective bacteria that had been selected for bacteriological warfare.
    Finally, the fifth department, named the "Education Department," trained cadres to use bacteriological warfare tools.
    The task of "Unit 100" was largely the same as that of "Unit 731," except that this unit cultivated bacteria that infect livestock and crops (gas gangrene, anthrax, and other bacteria).
    It was confirmed in court that, in addition to the two units mentioned above in northern Manchuria, the Japanese also organized two similar secret agencies in central and southern China, named "Unit Ei" and "Unit Nami."
    The Japanese fanatics prepared to kill the people of the Soviet Union, China, the Mongolian People's Republic, and the American army with bacteria. Hundreds of thousands of people were used for experiments with this tool of mass destruction, resulting in their deaths, mainly Chinese and Soviet people. In "Unit 731" alone, more than 3,000 people were brutally killed by inhuman and criminal experiments.
    The trial also confirmed that the Japanese aggressors not only prepared, but also used bacteriological weapons more than once in the implementation of their aggression plan: such as in the Khalkhin Gol area in 1939 against the Mongolian People's Republic and the Soviet Union; and during the war of aggression against China from 1940 to 1942, the Japanese army used bacteria in the aforementioned areas, causing the spread of plague and typhoid fever.
    The Japanese aggressors prepared to attack the Soviet Union and wanted to use bacteriological weapons extensively. For this purpose, they conducted special reconnaissance on the border and carried out several bacteriological attacks on the Soviet Union.
    The Soviet court has sentenced twelve Japanese war criminals guilty of preparing and using bacteriological weapons.
    However, it would be unjust to let the other main organizers and instigators who caused these appalling crimes go unpunished.
    Such war criminals are first and foremost:
    Hirohito established Unit 731 to manufacture deadly bacteria, under his special secret order.
    1. Hirohito - Emperor of Japan. It has been determined in the public trial in Khabarovsk that the establishment of the Japanese Army's center for preparing bacteriological warfare and using bacteriological weapons in the territory of Manchuria was implemented under Hirohito's special secret order. This center was named "Water Supply and Disease Prevention Bureau of the Kwantung Army," and later disguised under the name "Unit 731."
    In this secret organization, tools for bacteriological warfare against the Soviet Union, China, the Mongolian People's Republic, the American army, and other countries were prepared on a large scale. The unit used bacteriological weapons against the Mongolian People's Republic and the Soviet Union in the Khalkhin Gol area in 1939, and against China from 1941 to 1942.
    Former member of the Japanese Supreme Military Council and Commander-in-Chief of the Kwantung Army, General Yamada, testified:
    "Unit 731, stationed in Manchuria, was organized mainly for preparing tools for bacteriological warfare against the Soviet Union, the Mongolian People's Republic, and China."
    The following testimony from General Yamada demonstrates the extent to which the activities of Unit 731 were secretly concealed:
    "Unit 731 was publicly named 'Water Supply and Disease Prevention Bureau of the Kwantung Army,' which was obviously a cover for the unit's true mission. For this purpose, the staff of Unit 731 wore general military uniforms without special badges for medical work. We were deeply afraid that the gathering of a large number of medical personnel would cause unfavorable suspicion about the true nature of Unit 731's work."
    When explaining the preparation for the large-scale use of deadly bacteria to massively exterminate people, Yamada testified:
    "...Due to the successful completion of all preparations for using bacteriological weapons in accordance with the most effective methods, the period of mass production of bacteriological weapons and the practical use of bacteriological weapons in any aspect began in 1945, according to the first order of the Emperor's headquarters..."
    Lieutenant General Kajitsuka, former Director of the Medical Affairs Bureau of the Japanese Ministry of the Army (later Director of the Medical Affairs Bureau of the Kwantung Army), admitted: "Unit 731 was formed in 1936 under a special secret order from Emperor Hirohito."
    Kajitsuka testified: "I myself knew about this order and the list of personnel attached to the unit, because I personally stamped it with my private seal and signed for it."
    This unit was reorganized in 1939, the scope of its activities was expanded, the manufacturing of bacteriological weapons increased sharply, and the number of personnel increased twofold. This reorganization was also carried out under another secret order from Emperor Hirohito.
    Regarding this, General Kajitsuka continued to testify:
    "Around February 1940, I signed and read this order at the headquarters of the Kwantung Army. In addition, in the second half of 1940, under one or two secret orders from Emperor Hirohito, four more detachments were added to Unit 731..."
    The four detachments that General Kajitsuka referred to in court were stationed in areas bordering the Soviet Union. This has been confirmed by documents, especially by Order No. 398/1-KO of December 2, 1940, from General Umezu, former Commander-in-Chief of the Kwantung Army.
    Major General Kawashima, a medical officer and director of a department of Unit 731, also admitted that Unit 731 was formed in 1936, and that the various detachments of the unit were established in 1940 under the Emperor's order. Regarding this, Kawashima testified as follows:
    "Unit 731 was established in 1936 under a secret order from the Japanese Emperor... When I worked in Unit 731, serving as the chief of the General Affairs Department, I personally saw this secret order from the Emperor in the unit's files... The Emperor's order in 1940 stipulated that the unit's personnel should be increased to 3,000, including the various detachments newly established in various parts of Manchuria according to the order..."
    Therefore, according to the testimony of General Kajitsuka, former Director of the Medical Affairs Bureau of the Kwantung Army, and Kawashima, the main participants in the preparation of bacteriological warfare, it is revealed that Emperor Hirohito was one of the main participants in the preparation of bacteriological warfare.
        Ishii organized and led Unit 731 to conduct inhuman experiments on living people
    2. Ishii Shiro - Lieutenant General Medical Officer. The trial process fully proved that Ishii was an active organizer in the criminal preparation of bacteriological warfare and the actual use of bacteriological weapons against the Soviet Union, China, and the Mongolian People's Republic.
    Ishii organized and led the secret center of the Japanese army, Unit 731, for the preparation of bacteriological warfare. Under Ishii's direct leadership, criminal research was conducted in the preparation of bacteriological warfare, especially inhuman experiments on living people.
    Ishii directly researched a method of using fleas to transmit plague as a bacteriological weapon. He designed a special ceramic bomb called the "Ishii Bomb," which used the air force to spread plague with fleas.
    In order to conduct aggressive bacteriological warfare, Ishii personally researched a method of mass cultivation of bacteria (in particular, he designed a so-called "Ishii incubator").
    As confirmed in the Khabarovsk trial, Major General Kawashima Kiyoshi, Lieutenant Colonel Nishi Toyohiko, and assistant officer of Unit 731, Kurushima Shigeji, testified that General Ishii personally led the China-based detachment of Unit 731 in 1940, 1941, and 1942. During that time, they used various bacteriological weapons, causing the spread of plague, typhoid, paratyphoid, and other epidemics, resulting in the deaths of thousands of peaceful Chinese residents.
    Witness Furuichi - one of the participants in the Unit 731 detachment - testified in court that, under Ishii's direct orders, reservoirs were infected with various bacteria, poison was placed in food, and other serious crimes were committed.
    The testimony of Lieutenant Colonel Nishi Toyohiko, former head of a department of Unit 731, confirmed that in 1939, under Ishii's initiation, bacteriological weapons were used in the Khalkhin Gol area against the Soviet Union and the Mongolian People's Republic.
    In 1945, when Ishii was reappointed as the captain of Unit 731, he prepared to use bacteriological tools against the Soviet Union, the United States, and Britain.
    Major General Kawashima testified in the trial that in the summer of 1941, Ishii informed the heads of each department at a secret meeting that the unit's activities had been recognized by the General Staff of the Japanese Army. Due to the start of Hitler's anti-Soviet war, the General Staff had issued instructions to actively prepare for bacteriological warfare and expand the production of deadly bacteria, which Ishii implemented and completed.
    The characteristic of all of Ishii's activities was extreme cruelty and inhumanity. He had close ties with the Japanese Military Police and military intelligence agencies in Northeast China. Unit 731 received from them tens of thousands of people in so-called "special transport," who were used for criminal experiments, and as a result, inevitably died tragically.
    Former Commander-in-Chief of the Kwantung Army, Yamada, explained that Ishii was one of the most active participants in the preparation of bacteriological warfare.
    Yamada testified: "Unit 731" was Ishii's "favorite." Therefore, in 1945, he was again ordered to serve as the captain of the unit. His appointment as captain was directly related to the task of actively working with various bacteriological units at that time, and it was related to the Ministry of the Army's instructions to expand the manufacturing of bacteriological weapons.
  Kitano directly led the preparation of germ warfare and participated in germ warfare against our country
    3. Kitano Masazo - Lieutenant General Medical Officer, the materials from the trial proved that he served as the commander of Unit 731 from August 1942 to March 1945, directly led the preparation of germ warfare, and participated in the organization of the use of bacteriological weapons against China in 1942.
    Kitano's criminal activities have been fully revealed by the testimony of General Yamada, former Commander-in-Chief of the Kwantung Army, Major General Kawashima Kiyoshi, Major General Matsumura Bokukatsu, and Lieutenant General Kajitsuka Ryuji.
    General Yamada, who inspected Unit 731 in August 1944, testified that Kitano pointed out the unit's mission when reporting on the unit's activities:
    "...Researching various issues related to preparing for germ warfare... Kitano reported to me the situation of the production department of Unit 731, which was engaged in the large-scale manufacturing of various specialized bacterial agents sufficient for offensive warfare."
    According to Yamada's own confession, after listening to Kitano's report and personally inspecting the work of Unit 731, he "was greatly surprised by the scale of the research work and the great potential of the unit to manufacture bacteriological weapons."
    Major General Matsumura's testimony regarding the crimes committed by Kitano is as follows:
    "At the end of 1944, the captain of Unit 731 gave a report at the Kwantung Army Command Office. Kitano gave a report on the method of applying fleas infected with plague as bacteriological weapons... Yamada approved the method proposed by Kitano for applying fleas infected with plague as bacteriological weapons."
    Regarding this, Yamada testified:
    "In October or November 1944, General Kitano gave me a report on the results of applying plague-infected fleas as a means of bacteriological warfare. In addition to Kitano's report, there were also specialized films and various charts transported from Unit 731. These charts indicated the areas where experiments had been conducted to spread plague-infected fleas by aircraft... During the report, he presented various forms that clearly showed the results of conducting investigations into areas infected with plague bacteria.
    "Since I believed that the method of applying plague-infected fleas was extremely effective, I personally approved Kitano's report and presented them with a method of applying bacteriological weapons. The experimental results of applying plague-infected fleas were reported to the Emperor's General Headquarters."
    The testimony of Lieutenant General Kajitsuka convicted Lieutenant General Kitano of the following: in 1942, he participated in organizing the detachment that used bacteriological weapons to attack the Chinese, and participated in inhuman experiments on living people. According to Kajitsuka, he listened to Kitano's report on the unit's activities when he visited Unit 731 in August 1944. Kitano reported: "...A group of staff members from Unit 731 had traveled to the Chinese front south of Shanghai, where they dropped a large number of plague-infected fleas from high altitudes onto land inhabited by Chinese residents, and plague occurred where these fleas landed... In addition, Kitano also described to me the experiments with chronic bombs filled with anthrax bacteria that were conducted in the Andong railway station area. The shrapnel from these bombs scratched people and animals, infecting them with anthrax."
    Kitano's crimes during his tenure as captain of Unit 731 were also confirmed by the testimony of Major General Kawashima. Kawashima personally participated in meetings under Kitano's leadership "to discuss various issues related to researching and manufacturing bacterial means and their practical application in war."
    Wakamatsu served as the captain of Unit 100, spreading animal plague bacteria to carry out sabotage
    4. Wakamatsu Jiro - Major General Veterinary Officer, served as captain of Unit 100 in 1945. According to the materials from the Khabarovsk trial, he engaged in the manufacture of bacteriological weapons and carried out sabotage by infecting reservoirs, pastures, and livestock with anthrax bacteria, glanders bacteria, and other animal plague bacteria. The unit also conducted inhuman and criminal experiments on living people.
    Former Commander-in-Chief of the Kwantung Army, General Yamada, admitted that Unit 100 engaged in seeking methods for applying animal plague bacteria and their mass manufacturing. Regarding the crimes committed by Wakamatsu, General Yamada gave the following testimony:
    "The mission and actual activities of Unit 100 were completely similar to the mission and activities of Unit 731 in preparing for bacteriological warfare. The only difference was that the bacteriological weapons manufactured by Unit 731 were intended to massively exterminate the enemy's manpower, while the manufacturing of animal plague bacteria by Unit 100 was intended to exterminate livestock."
    Former member of Unit 100, Lieutenant Hirazakura, testified regarding Wakamatsu's participation in the active preparation of bacteriological weapons: Wakamatsu said more than once to the staff of Unit 100:
    "In the event that Japan goes to war with the Soviet Union, Unit 100 should become a factory for manufacturing various mass bacteria and potent poisons to carry out anti-Soviet sabotage and bacteriological warfare."
    Hirazakura also revealed another point about Wakamatsu: under his instructions, specialized reconnaissance and sabotage detachments were dispatched to the Trelech area and the Hailar area to study the possibility of conducting bacteriological sabotage activities against the Soviet Union and the Mongolian People's Republic, and in fact, these sabotage activities were carried out. The results of the study were reported to General Wakamatsu, who then gave further instructions for carrying out the sabotage activities.
    The testimony of Miyu and Hataki, former staff members of Unit 100, in the trial confirmed that in Unit 100, led by Wakamatsu, they were brutally killed by the inhuman and criminal method of using living people to conduct experiments.
    The testimony of Lieutenant General Takahashi Takatsu, former Director of the Veterinary Bureau of the Japanese Kwantung Army, exposed the crimes of Wakamatsu, former captain of Unit 100: he closely colluded with the intelligence department of the Kwantung Army General Staff and personally led the criminal research of bacteriological weapons and the preparation of bacteriological sabotage activities.
    Takahashi also revealed another point about Wakamatsu: he participated in a meeting at the office of the former Commander-in-Chief of the Kwantung Army, Umezu, in 1941 to discuss the preparation of bacteriological warfare. In November 1944, Wakamatsu also participated in a similar meeting held in the office of the former commander, Yamada. At the meeting, Takahashi reported on his plan for applying bacteriological weapons.
  Kasahara formulated specific methods for using bacteriological weapons and led the preparation for anti-Soviet germ warfare
    5. Kasahara Yukio - Lieutenant General, served as the Chief of Staff of the Kwantung Army from 1942 to 1945, during which he led the preparation for anti-Soviet bacteriological warfare and directly participated in the formulation of specific methods for applying bacteriological weapons.
    Kasahara's active role in the preparation of bacteriological warfare has been fully confirmed by the testimony of General Yamada, Major General Matsumura, Lieutenant General Takahashi, Colonel Tamura, and other defendants and witnesses who were summoned in the trial.
    Colonel Tamura, former head of the Personnel Department of the Kwantung Army General Staff, said when he was assigned to that position in early January 1945:
    "...Lieutenant General Kasahara told me that since Unit 731... was preparing for bacteriological warfare, I should treat it with extra attention."
    Regarding the issue of formulating various methods for applying bacteriological weapons, General Yamada testified:
    "...In order to study methods for applying bacteriological weapons, special committees were established..., and the Chief of Staff served as the chairman of these committees... The committee's decisions regarding the use of bacteriological warfare means were reported to the Commander of the Kwantung Army and, after being approved by him, were reported to the Japanese General Staff."
    Major General Matsumura, head of the Operations Department of the General Staff, said when explaining the activities of the Kwantung Army General Staff in preparing for anti-Soviet bacteriological warfare:
    "...After receiving instructions to increase the manufacturing of bacteriological weapons, Kasahara entrusted me with studying the possibility of applying bacteriological weapons against the Soviet Union... I studied this issue and gave a suitable report to Kasahara. And Kasahara, as I have said, approved my opinion... I reported to Kasahara that in the event of war against the Soviet Union, bacteriological weapons should be applied in the areas of Voroshilov, Khabarovsk, Hailar, and Chita."
    In the autumn of 1944, Kasahara participated in discussions on methods for applying "Ishii-style" bacteriological bombs.
    In November 1944, Kasahara participated in a special meeting of the Supreme Command, where the results of bacteriological experiments were discussed. These experiments were conducted by Unit 100 to prepare for the practical application of bacteriological weapons against the Soviet Union.
    In summary, it is confirmed that Kasahara was one of the organizers of bacteriological warfare. He directly studied the issue of mainly using bacteriological weapons against the Soviet Union, the Mongolian People's Republic, and China.
    Therefore, the materials determined in the Khabarovsk trial and the judgment of the Military Tribunal of the Primorsky Krai have proven that the leading roles in the preparation and implementation of the heinous crime of bacteriological warfare against humanity were played not only by the Japanese war criminals who had already been sentenced according to the judgment of the International Military Tribunal for the Far East, and the twelve Japanese war criminals who had been sentenced according to the judgment of the Khabarovsk Military Tribunal, but also by Japanese Emperor Hirohito and Japanese Army Generals Ishii Shiro (former captain of Unit 731), Kitano (also former captain of Unit 731), Wakamatsu Jiro (former captain of Unit 100), and Kasahara Yukio (former Chief of Staff of the Kwantung Army).
    Based on these points, and considering that:
    Bacteriological weapons have been banned by the Geneva Protocol of June 17, 1925, and have long been condemned by all civilized nations as the most serious crime that violates national justice and conscience. Therefore, the aforementioned crimes are a barbaric violation of the laws and customs of war and the recognized norms of international law.
    The resolution of the Allied Council for Japan on April 3, 1946, evaluated those who violated the laws and customs of war as war criminals. And the resolution of June 19, 1947, stipulated that "all war criminals should be strictly judged."
    The Allied Council for Japan decided on April 3, 1946, "...to take all possible measures to expose, investigate, arrest, and imprison all suspected war criminals," and stipulated that in order to study matters related to war criminals in the Far East, the Supreme Commander of the Allied Forces must "appoint a special international military tribunal."
    The Soviet government proposes: In accordance with Article 5, Section "A" of the Allied Council for Japan resolution of April 3, 1946 (Document FEC.007/13), to appoint an international special military tribunal in the near future, and to hand over the war criminals who have been revealed to have committed heinous crimes against humanity, Japanese Emperor Hirohito, Ishii Shiro, Kitano Masazo, Wakamatsu Jiro, Kasahara Yukio, and other generals to the aforementioned international tribunal.
    At the same time, the Soviet government believes that it is necessary to announce all the trial materials of Yamada, Kajitsuka, and other Japanese war criminals in Khabarovsk in December 1949, which are revealed in this note, and hand them over to the international military tribunal for processing after it is organized.
    Mr. Deputy Minister, please accept my highest regards for you.
    To His Excellency, Li Kenong, Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China
            February 1, 1950, Beijing

　　苏联政府致我国政府照会
    提议设国际特别军事法庭审判裕仁等日本细菌战犯
    【新华社北京四日电】中华人民共和国外交部李克农副部长，于二月一日收到苏联驻中国大使馆代办史白夫送来的苏联政府致我国政府的照会一件。照会全文如下：副部长先生：
    本人奉苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟外交部长之命荣幸地作如下之通知：
    伯力滨海军区军事法庭自一九四九年十二月二十五日至二十九日公审山田、高桥、梶冢及其他日本战犯，证实了以日本裕仁天皇为首的统治集团多年以来即秘密准备细菌战争——绝灭人性的侵略武器之一。
    日本军国主义者在其准备反对爱好和平的人民的侵略战争的罪恶计划中，预备大量使用细菌武器，以散布鼠疫、霍乱、伤寒、坏疽病、炭疽热病及其他可怕的致命传染病的方法来消灭军队及和平居民，包括老人、妇女与儿童在内。
    根据日本裕仁天皇的命令及日本陆军省和参谋本部的任务所专门组织的日本军队的细菌机关中，大量孵育了鼠疫、霍乱、伤寒、炭疽热病的致命细菌及其他危险的传染病菌，制造了散布细菌的炮弹和工具，训练了特种部队，以便大量传染居民、贮水池、住宅、播种田地和牲畜。
    这些机关非常机密，为了伪装起见，命名为“关东军部队用水供应及疾病预防局”和“关东军兽类传染病试验局”。后来又改名为“七三一号部队”和“一○○号部队”。这两个部队都有许多支队，隶属于关东军的分遣队，各驻扎于日本反苏作战计划中所标志的主攻方向。
    “七三一号部队”驻扎在距哈尔滨市二十公里，在平房车站地区专门建筑起来的小城里，整个小城被宣布为军事禁区。该部队计有三千科学与技术工作人员并拥有多数的实验所和强有力的大量制造细菌的装备，用以保证进行大规模细菌战争的可能性。
    在审判中证实，这些部队由五个处组成，这些处中只有一个处，第三处，是从事该部队的公开业务，即管理部队用水供应事宜的。这个处公开地驻在哈尔滨城里，即不在上述专门设防的军事禁区小城领域之内。所有其他四个处都是专门从事于准备和进行细菌战争有关的问题。
    第一处名为研究处，从事研究和孵育致命细菌，并从中选择出认为作为细菌武器最有效的种类。
    第二处是实验处，从事在活人身上检验各种细菌的效力，并设计向敌区传染细菌的炸弹和方法。在这个处中有四千五百专门繁殖为蔓延鼠疫传染的跳蚤养殖所。为了进行利用空军帮助使用细菌战工具的罪恶实验，该处在安达车站附近设有专用的靶场和空军部队。
    第四处是所谓生产处，其任务是大量生产已选择好的可作细菌战之用的最有效的细菌。
    最后，第五处名为“教育处”，以训练使用细菌战工具的干部。
    “一○○号部队”的任务与“七三一号部队”的任务大同小异，其不同之处是该部队是孵育传染牲畜和农作物的细菌（坏疽病、炭疽热病及其他细菌）。
    在法庭上证实，除了以上指出的在北满的两个部队外，日本人在华中和华南也组织了两个类似的秘密机关，名为“荣字部队”和“波字部队”。
    日本的狂妄者们准备用细菌杀害苏联的、中国的、蒙古人民共和国的人民和美国的军队。曾有成千成万的人被用来作此种大批毁灭的工具的实验而致死亡，其中主要的是中国人和苏联人。仅仅在“七三一号部队”，因进行非人性的罪恶的实验就野蛮地弄死了三千多人。
    在审判中并证实了，日本侵略者们不仅是准备了，而且在实现其侵略计划中已不只一次地使用了细菌武器：如一九三九年在哈尔新——葛尔河区域反对蒙古人民共和国和苏联；一九四○——一九四二年侵略中国的战争中，日军在上述各地施用细菌，引起了鼠疫和伤寒传染病。
    日本侵略者们准备进攻苏联，想广泛地使用细菌武器，为此目的在边境进行了专门的侦察并实施了若干次对苏联的细菌袭击。
    苏联法庭已经判决了十二个犯准备与使用细菌武器罪的日本战犯。
    然而，要是让造成这些惨绝人寰的罪行的其他主要组织者与鼓励者逍遥法外，则是不公正的。（⑴⑷）
    此类战犯首先就是：
    裕仁设立七三一部队制造杀人细菌，是他下的特别密令。
    １、裕仁——日本天皇。在伯力的公开审判中已经确定：在满洲的领土上设立日本陆军准备细菌战与使用细菌武器的中心，是奉裕仁的特别密令而实行的，这个中心名为“关东军部队用水供应及疾病预防局”，而后又以“七三一号部队”的名称伪装起来。
    在这个秘密组织中，大规模地准备了反对苏联、中国、蒙古人民共和国、美军与其他国家的细菌战的工具，该部队于一九三九年在哈尔新——葛尔河地区应用细菌武器反对蒙古人民共和国与苏联，而在一九四一至四二年，则用来反对中国。
    前日本最高军事参议会议员与关东军总司令山田将军供称：
    “驻扎于满洲的七三一部队，主要是为了准备对付苏联以及蒙古人民共和国与中国的细菌战的工具，而组织起来的。”
    下列山田将军的供词：证明七三一部队的活动阴谋隐藏到了什么程度：
    “七三一部队公开名为‘关东军用水供应及疾病预防局’，这显然是对该部队的真实使命的掩护。为此目的，七三一部队的工作人员穿着一般的军服，没有医务工作的特别徽号。我们深恐大批医务工作人员的聚集，会引起对七三一部队工作的真正性质，发生不利的怀疑。”
    山田在说明准备大规模使用致命细菌来大量消灭人民时，供称：
    “……由于按照改善最有效的方法使用细菌武器的一切准备工作之顺利完成，根据天皇总部的第一道命令，一九四五年就开始了大规模制造细菌武器及在任何方面实际使用细菌武器的时期……。”
    前日本陆军省医务局局长（后来为关东军医务局局长）梶冢中将供认：“七三一部队是在一九三六年奉裕仁天皇之特别密令组成的。”
    梶冢供称：“我本人知道这个命令和附在后面的该部队的人员名单，是因为经过我亲盖私章而签收的。”
    这一部队曾于一九三九年改组，部队的活动范围扩大了，细菌武器的制造急剧地增加了，而构成人员的数目增加了两倍。这一改组也是奉裕仁天皇另一道密令而进行的。
    关于这方面，梶冢将军继续供称：
    “大约是在一九四○年二月，我在关东军司令部签阅了这个命令。除此而外，一九四○年下半年奉裕仁天皇的一个或两个密令，为七三一部队又添设了四个支队……。”
    梶冢将军在法庭上所指的那四个支队，曾驻扎在与苏联接壤的地区。这已为文件所证实，特别是为前关东军总司令梅津将军一九四○年十二月二日３９８／１—ＫＯ号的命令所证实。
    七三一部队的处长陆军少将医官川岛同样供认：七三一部队于一九三六年组成，而该部队之各支队是于一九四○年根据天皇命令而建立的。关于这方面川岛供认如下：
    “七三一部队根据日本天皇之密令成立于一九三六年，……当我在七三一部队工作，担任总务处长职务期间，在部队卷宗里曾亲眼看见过天皇的这个密令……。一九四○年的天皇命令预定该部队的人员要增加到三千人，其中包括根据该命令在满洲各地新成立的各个支队在内……”。
    因此，根据准备细菌战争的主要参加者前关东军陆军医务局局长梶冢中将及川岛的供词，便揭露了裕仁天皇是准备细菌战主要参加者之一。
        石井曾组织与领导七三一部队用活人作惨无人道的实验
    ２、石井四郎——中将医官。在审判过程中充分证明了石井在罪恶的准备细菌战和实际使用细菌武器反对苏联、中国和蒙古人民共和国中，为积极的组织者。
    石井为准备细菌战曾组织了并领导了日军秘密中心——七三一号部队。在石井直接领导之下，进行了细菌战准备方面的罪恶研究，特别是用活人来作惨无人道的实验。
    石井直接地研究出一种使用跳蚤传染鼠疫的方法，用来作为细菌武器。他设计了一种特别的陶瓷炸弹，名为“石井炸弹”，利用空军用跳蚤来传染鼠疫。
    为了进行侵略的细菌战，石井又亲自研究出一种大量孵育细菌的方法（特别是，设计了一种所谓“石井孵育器”）。
    如伯力审判中所证实，少将医官川岛清，中佐医官西丰彦及七三一部队助理士久留岛重治供称：石井将军在一九四○、一九四一、一九四二年当中曾亲自带领七三一部队的驻华派遣军。在那期间，他们使用了各种细菌武器，引起鼠疫、伤寒、副伤寒和其他疫病的蔓延，使成千的中国和平居民遭到死亡。
    证人古市——七三一部队派遣军的参加者之一——在法庭上证明：在石井的直接命令之下，曾使蓄水池染上各种细菌，在食物中放毒，并进行了其他各种最严重的罪行。
    前七三一部队的一个处长中佐西丰彦的供词证实了：一九三九年根据石井的发动，曾在哈尔新——葛尔河区使用过细菌武器，来反对苏联和蒙古人民共和国。
    一九四五年，当石井再次被任命为七三一部队队长时，他准备了使用细菌工具来对付苏联、美国和英国。
    少将医官川岛在审判中供称：一九四一年夏，石井曾在一次秘密会议上通知各处长称，部队的活动已获得日军参谋本部的认可，由于德国希特勒反苏战争的开始，参谋部曾下达积极准备细菌战、扩大致命细菌生产的指示，经石井实施完成。
    石井一切活动的特点是非常残酷和绝无人性。他和东北日本宪兵队和军队特务机关有着密切的联系。七三一部队从他们那里收到所谓“特别运送品”的成千成万的人，用作罪恶的实验，这些人结果必遭惨死。
    前关东军总司令山田说明石井是准备细菌战的最积极的参加者之一。
    山田供称：“七三一部队”是石井的“宠儿”。所以一九四五年他又受命担任该部队队长的职务。他之出任队长就是直接与当时各细菌部队积极工作的任务有直接关系的，是与陆军省的扩大制造细菌武器的指示有关系的。
  北野直接领导细菌战准备工作曾参加对我国进行细菌战
    ３、北野政藏——中将医官，审讯的材料证明：一九四二年八月至一九四五年三月期间，他曾任七三一部队长官，直接领导过细菌战的准备工作，并参加了一九四二年使用细菌武器反对中国的组织工作。
    北野的罪恶活动，已为前关东军总司令山田将军、少将医官川岛清、松村泊胜少将与梶冢龙二中将的供词所完全揭露。
    曾于一九四四年八月视察过七三一部队的山田将军供称，北野在报告该队的活动时曾指出，该队的任务是：
    “……研究有关准备进行细菌战的方法的各种问题……北野曾向我报告七三一部队生产处的情形，该处正在大规模地从事制造足以进行攻击战的各种专门的细菌药剂。”
    据山田本人供认，他在听取北野的报告并亲自视察七三一部队的工作后，“曾因研究工作的规模与该部队具有极大的可能制造细菌武器而大为吃惊”。
    松村少将关于北野所犯的罪行，供述如下：
    “一九四四年底七三一部队队长在关东军司令办公室作了报告。北野作了关于应用传染鼠疫的跳蚤作为细菌武器的方法的报告。……山田批准了北野所提出的应用传染鼠疫的跳蚤作为细菌武器的方法”。
    关于这点，山田供称：
    “一九四四年的十月或十一月，北野将军向我作了一个关于将鼠疫蚤用作细菌战的手段的应用结果的报告。除了北野的报告还有从七三一部队运来的专门的影片，以及各种图表。这些图表指出了那些已进行借飞机传播传染鼠疫跳蚤的实验地区……。报告时他出示各种表格，这些表格一目了然地显示出进行调查鼠疫细菌所传染区域的结果。
    “我既然认为应用传染鼠疫的跳蚤的方法是极为有效的，便亲自批准了北野的报告，并向他们提出了应用细菌武器的方法。应用传染鼠疫的跳蚤的实验结果曾呈报天皇统帅部。”
    中将医官梶冢的供词使北野中将被判明犯了下述的罪状：他于一九四二年曾参加组织那使用细菌武器进攻中国人的派遣队，并参加用活人进行惨无人性的实验。据梶冢供称，他于一九四四年八月在访问七三一部队时听取了北野关于该队活动的报告。北野报告说：“……七三一部队的一组工作人员已经开往上海以南地区的中国前线，在那儿从高空把大量传染鼠疫的跳蚤向有中国居民的土地上撒下，而这些跳蚤落下的地方，就发生了鼠疫……。此外，北野并向我叙述在安达车站地区还进行了填满了炭疽热细菌的慢性炸弹的实验。这种炸弹的弹片擦伤了人与动物，就使它们染上炭疽热。”
    北野在七三一部队队长任内的罪行，同样也为少将医官川岛的供词所证实。川岛曾亲自参加在北野领导下“讨论有关研究制造细菌手段及其在战争中之实际应用的各种问题”的会议。
    若松曾担任一○○部队队长传播兽瘟细菌进行破坏
    ４、若松次郎——少将兽医官，一九四五年曾任一○○部队队长。据伯力审判的材料证明，他曾经从事制造细菌武器，并且用使贮水池、牧场、与牲畜染上炭疽热细菌、鼻疽菌与其他兽瘟细菌的方法实现了破坏活动。该队也对活人进行了惨无人道的罪恶实验。
    前关东军总司令山田将军承认，一○○部队曾经从事寻求应用兽瘟菌的方法及其大量制造的工作。关于若松所犯的罪行，山田将军作了如下的供词：
    “一○○部队的使命与实际活动，在准备细菌战上是与七三一部队的使命与活动完全类似的，差别只是七三一部队所制造的细菌武器，是预定用来大量消灭敌人的人力，而一○○部队的兽瘟菌的制造，则是预定用来消灭牲畜的。”
    前一○○部队属员陆军中尉平樱，关于若松参加细菌武器的积极准备工作一事曾供称：若松在一○○部队的工作人员中曾不止一次地说：
    “万一日本与苏联开战，一○○部队就该成为制造各种大量细菌与烈性毒药的工厂，来进行反苏的破坏及细菌战。”
    平樱同样也揭发了若松的另一点：在他的指示之下，曾经派出了专门的侦察破坏派遣队到特里列奇区和海拉尔区去研究进行反对苏联与蒙古人民共和国的细菌破坏活动的可能性，并且事实上实现了这种破坏活动。研究进行的结果已报告若松将军，而他则对实行破坏活动又作了进一步的指示。
    前一○○部队工作人员三友与畑木在审判中的供词已经证实在若松领导的该一○○部队中，曾经使用活人进行惨无人道的罪恶实验的方法残暴地弄死了他们。
    前日本关东军兽医局局长，中将兽医官高桥高笃的供词，暴露了前一○○部队队长若松的罪状：他曾与关东军参谋部谍报处密切勾结，亲自领导细菌武器的罪恶研究与细菌破坏活动的准备工作。
    高桥同样也揭发了若松的另一点：他曾于一九四一年在前关东军总司令梅津处，参加一个讨论细菌战的准备工作的会议。一九四四年十一月若松又参加过一个类似的会议，该会在前司令山田的办公厅内举行。会上高桥报告了自己对于应用细菌武器的计划。
  笠原拟制使用细菌武器具体方法领导反苏细菌战的准备工作
    ５、笠原行雄——中将，一九四二年至一九四五年任关东军参谋长期内，实现了对于反苏细菌战的准备工作的领导，并且直接参加应用细菌武器的具体方法的拟制。
    笠原在准备细菌战中的积极作用，已为山田将军、松村少将、中将兽医官高桥、田村大佐以及其他在审判中被传讯的被告与证人的供词所完全证实。
    前关东军参谋部人事处处长田村大佐在谈到一九四五年一月初在被派他担任该项职务时说：
    “……笠原中将对我说，既然七三一部队……准备细菌战，我就应该以分外的注意去对待它。”
    至于制订各项应用细菌武器的方法问题，山田将军供称：
    “……为了研究应用细菌武器的方法，曾经成立了一些特别委员会……，由参谋长担任这些委员会的主席。……委员会关于使用细菌战争手段的决定曾呈报关东军司令，并经他批准后报告给日本总参谋部。”
    该参谋部作战处处长松村少将，在说明关东军参谋部准备反苏细菌战的活动时，供称：
    “……在接获关于增加细菌武器制造的指示以后，笠原委托我研究应用细菌武器对付苏联的可能性问题。……我研究了这一问题，并向笠原作了一个适当的报告。而笠原，我已说过，就批准了我的意见……。我向笠原报告，万一对苏联作战，应该在伏罗希洛夫、伯力、海兰泡与赤塔等地区应用细菌武器。”
    一九四四年秋，笠原曾参加讨论应用“石井式”细菌炸弹的方法问题。
    一九四四年十一月笠原参加了最高参谋特别会议，会上讨论了细菌试验的结果问题，这次试验是一○○队部为准备实际应用细菌武器反对苏联而进行的。
    综上所述，证实笠原是细菌战的组织者之一，他曾直接研究把细菌武器主要用来反对苏联、蒙古人民共和国和中国的问题。
    因此，伯力审判中所判明的材料和滨海军区军事法庭的判决书业已证明：在准备和实现那反对人类的滔天大罪的细菌战中起主导作用的，不仅有根据远东国际军事法庭的判决书所早已宣判的日本战犯，和根据伯力军事法庭的判决书所宣判的十二名日本战犯，而且还有日本天皇裕仁和日本陆军将军石井四郎（前七三一部队队长）、北野（亦为前七三一部队队长）、若松次郎（前一○○部队队长）和笠原行雄（前关东军参谋长）。
    根据这几点，并考虑到：
    细菌武器已为一九二五年六月十七日的日内瓦议定书所禁用，早已为各文明民族所斥责，视为违背民族正义和天良的最严重的罪行。因此，上述罪行即已成为对于战争的立法和惯例与公认的国际法常规的野蛮的破坏。
    一九四六年四月三日同盟国在远东委员会的决议中评定破坏战争立法与惯例者作为战争罪犯论。而在一九四七年六月十九日的决议中规定了“应严格裁判一切战犯”。
    一九四六年四月三日远东委员会决定了“……采取一切可能的办法，以便暴露、追究、逮捕和监禁一切有战犯嫌疑的分子”，并规定了为了研究有关远东各战犯的事宜，盟国总司令必须“任命特别国际军事法庭”。
    苏联政府提议：根据一九四六年四月三日远东委员会决议（ＦＥＣ·００７１３号文件）之第五条“Ａ”款，于最近期内委任国际特别军事法庭，并把已被揭露为完成反对人类的滔天罪恶的战犯日本裕仁天皇、石井四郎、北野政藏、若松次郎、笠原行雄等将领交给上述国际法庭。
    同时，苏联政府认为必须宣布所有一九四九年十二月在伯力对本照会中指出所暴露了的罪恶滔天的山田、梶冢及其他日本战犯之审判材料，待国际军事法庭组织后即将全部交其处理。
    副部长先生，请接受我对你的崇高的敬意。
    此照中华人民共和国外交部副部长李克农先生阁下
            一九五○年二月一日北京
