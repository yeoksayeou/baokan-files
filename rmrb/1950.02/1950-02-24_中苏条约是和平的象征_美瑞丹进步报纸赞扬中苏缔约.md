Xinhua News Agency, Prague, February 23rd: New York Airmail - The American Communist Party's newspaper, the Daily Worker, published an editorial on the 16th entitled "A Treaty of Historic Significance," stating: "The Goddess of Peace smiles happily today. It is a good day for her. The 200 million people of the Soviet Union and the 475 million people of New China have just signed a remarkable treaty of mutual assistance to prevent attacks by Japanese imperialists or any country colluding with them. The Sino-Soviet treaty is a model of brotherly and equal relations between countries. The Sino-Soviet alliance is a strong new defense line for democracy and national independence. These two countries are proclaiming to the world how two great powers should help each other for their mutual benefit."

Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, February 23rd: Telecommunication Agency, Copenhagen, February 20th: The Swedish newspaper "New Era" stated in an editorial commenting on the Sino-Soviet Treaty: One-third of humanity "has united their firm efforts to maintain peace and prevent the American imperialist plan to dominate the world (a plan that has suffered a crushing defeat in China). The banner of socialism can never be taken from the hands of the working people again. The door of history has been opened to a truly human society, a communist society. Dying capitalism can no longer close this door." The newspaper continued: "Everyone understands that if China, with the help of the Soviet Union and other friendly countries, can increase the proportion of industry in its economy fivefold within ten to fifteen years, this will further prove the superiority of socialism over capitalism, even in peacetime." The newspaper concluded that only those who fear peace and peaceful competition between social systems would consider the Sino-Soviet Treaty a danger. And those who, like the people of the Soviet Union and China, demand and need peace, must be deeply satisfied with the first result of the negotiations between Stalin and Mao Zedong in Moscow.

Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, February 23rd: Telecommunication Agency, Copenhagen, February 21st: The Danish Communist Party's newspaper "Land and People" compared the Sino-Soviet Treaty with the North Atlantic Treaty and commented: The North Atlantic Treaty is an agreement between countries whose interests are very conflicting and who are constantly fighting and competing with each other. It is actually completely dominated by the United States, this imperialist power; the Sino-Soviet Treaty, on the other hand, is concluded on the basis of complete equality and mutual respect between the two countries.

The North Atlantic Treaty is an aggressive military alliance, openly targeting the Soviet Union; while the Sino-Soviet Treaty is a tool to defend against possible future aggression by Japan.

The North Atlantic Treaty is a symbol of rearmament race, remilitarization, and the hydrogen bomb; while the Sino-Soviet Treaty is a symbol of peace. This Sino-Soviet Treaty, in contrast to the North Atlantic Treaty, does not force the contracting parties to assume any obligations related to rearmament, building military bases, expanding troops, or so-called "cooperation" for "defense" under the supreme command of foreigners. This treaty only stipulates that China and the Soviet Union work for peace, promptly conclude a peace treaty with Japan, and agree to help each other in peaceful construction.

The North Atlantic Treaty gives the most powerful contracting party—the United States—the right to deal with the territories, armies, and economic resources of other contracting parties. In the Sino-Soviet Treaty, the Soviet Union is the largest contracting party, but it gives China the greatest benefits, abolishing all past powers in Chinese territory, withdrawing troops from strategic ports such as Lushun (Port Arthur) and Dalian (Dairen), and providing China with a $300 million loan for construction, with an interest rate of only 1 percent, and without humiliating conditions attached, such as those attached to the Marshall Plan "aid."

The newspaper continued: The Sino-Soviet Treaty lays a lasting foundation for peace and friendship between 700 million people, and is also a powerful move to promote universal world peace, extending world peace to an unprecedented scope. Now that the forces of war are facing the united strength of China and the Soviet Union, they will have to think twice before using hydrogen bomb hysteria to intimidate the world and launch a third world war.

### 中苏条约是和平的象征  美瑞丹进步报纸赞扬中苏缔约

　　中苏条约是和平的象征
    美瑞丹进步报纸赞扬中苏缔约
    【新华社布拉格二十三日电】纽约航讯，美国共产党机关报工人日报于十六日发表题为《一个具有历史意义的条约》的社论称：和平女神今天愉快地微笑着。今天是她的一个好日子。苏联的两万万人民和人民的新中国的四万万七千五百万人民刚刚签订了一个令人注意的互助条约，以防止日本帝国主义者或任何与它勾结的国家的袭击。中苏条约是国与国间兄弟般平等关系的楷模。中苏同盟是民主与民族独立的一个强大的新的防线。这两个国家把两大强国应该如何为它们相互间的利益而互助，昭告全世界。
    【新华社北京二十三日电】电通社哥本哈根二十日讯：瑞典《新时代》报社论在评论中苏条约时指出：三分之一的人类，“已把他们维护和平及阻止美国帝国主义统治世界的计划（这一计划在中国已遭到粉碎性的失败）的坚决努力联合起来。社会主义的旗帜，是永远不能再从劳动人民手中夺走的了。历史之门已开放给真正的人类社会、共产主义社会。垂死的资本主义已再不能关闭这扇门了”。该报继称：每个人都了解，如果中国在苏联及其他友好国家的帮助之下，能够在十年到十五年之内，使它经济中工业的比重增加五倍，那么，这将进一步证明社会主义对资本主义的优越性，即使在和平时期。该报末称，只有那些害怕和平及社会制度之间的和平竞赛的人们，才会认为中苏条约是一个危险。而那些象苏联和中国人民一样要求和需要和平的人们，必定对斯大林和毛泽东在莫斯科举行的谈判的第一个成果深深感到满意。
    【新华社北京二十三日电】电通社哥本哈根二十一日讯：丹麦共产党机关报“国土与人民”报将中苏条约与北大西洋公约作一对照并发表评论称：北大西洋公约是彼此利益很冲突并且始终在互相斗争、互相竞争的国家之间的一个协定。它实际上完全是由美国这个帝国主义的大国支配的；中苏条约则是根据两国间完全平等和互相尊重而缔结的。
    北大西洋公约是一个侵略性的军事同盟，它公开地针对着苏联；而中苏条约则是防御日本将来可能的侵略的一个工具。
    北大西洋公约是重整军备竞赛，重行军国主义化和氢弹的象征；而中苏条约却是和平的象征。这个中苏条约，恰与北大西洋公约相反，并不强制签约国承担任何有关重整军备、建造军事基地、扩充军队或是在外国人的最高指挥之下的所谓“配合”其“防卫”等等义务。这个条约仅仅规定中苏两国为和平而工作，从速缔结对日和约，此外，并彼此约定对于和平建设互相援助。
    北大西洋公约给最强大的一个缔约国——美国——以一种得以处理其他缔约国领土、军队及经济资源的权利。在中苏条约中，苏联是最大的缔约国，但却给中国以最大的利益，废弃昔日在中国领土上的一切权力，自战略性港口旅顺、大连等地撤兵，并以三亿美元贷款给中国，作为建设之用，利息仅百分之一，并且没有附带的侮辱性的条件，如像马歇尔计划“援助”所附加的那样。
    该报继称：中苏条约打下了七万万人民间的和平和友好的持久基础，也是促进世界普遍和平的有力的一举，使世界和平发展到前所未见的一个范围。战争势力现在既面对着中苏团结起来的力量，那末，在他们利用氢弹歇斯底里来恐吓世人并发动第三次世界大战之前，必将思维再三，不敢贸然动手。
