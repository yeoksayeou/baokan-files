　　The Richest and Most Vivid Lesson
    Thoughts and Feelings on Participating in the Land Reform Work in the Suburbs of Beijing
    Li Youyi, Teaching Assistant, Department of Law, Peking University
    Since the launch of the land reform work in the suburbs of Beijing, I, like many others, have been looking forward to the opportunity to participate in this great movement.
    This time, the ideal was finally realized. I, along with more than one hundred students from the Department of Law of Peking University, participated in the second batch of land reform villages in the suburbs of Beijing.
    We went to the countryside on the fifth day of the first lunar month and returned on the sixth day of the second lunar month, a period of not very long, exactly one month. However, in this month, I saw many things I had never seen before in my life, heard many things I had never heard before in my life, increased a lot of practical knowledge, and solved a lot of ideological problems. Since I started school, this is probably the richest and most vivid lesson. The regret is: I do not yet have the ability to write the contents of this lesson into words so that everyone can feel as if they are personally experiencing it when they read it. I can only talk about some of my心得 and feelings after taking this lesson to let everyone know: What role does participating in land reform play for an intellectual?
    The most obvious is probably a further understanding of several basic viewpoints of Marxism-Leninism.
    First of all, in school, we studied "The Labor View," and knew that "Labor creates mankind," "Labor creates the world," and "The activities of the working people create history." However, someone once asked me: "Are farmers more important or are intellectuals more important?" My answer was: "It's hard to say, each has its own importance." Someone once asked me: "Is it too much for you to take four hundred catties of millet per month?" My answer was: "Not too much, this is the minimum salary."
    When I arrived in the countryside, I happened to encounter the delivery of public grain.
    "Do you feel sorry when you hand over public grain?" I asked an old villager.
    "If we don't hand over public grain, what will you eat?" He smiled and said.
    "How much grain can you harvest per mu of land each year?" I asked again.
    "In previous years, the harvest was good, more than one shi per mu, but this year the land was flooded, only four or five dou per mu." He replied.
    I silently calculated: This year, four farmers, cultivating one hundred mu of land, working hard for a year, the total harvest is only enough to support one teaching assistant (however, farmers in the suburbs of Beijing do not get an average of three mu of land per person!). Thinking of my previous answer, I felt a little ashamed.
    At home, when I am happy, I sweep the floor or fetch a pot of water, and proudly ask my wife: "How is my labor view?" My wife says: "Excellent, you can be considered a labor hero."
    In the countryside, there are mass meetings to classify classes.
    A farmer pointed at the landlord's nose and asked: "You say you are not a landlord, have you labored?"
    The landlord replied affirmatively: "Of course I have labored."
    "What have you labored at?" The farmer stared wide-eyed.
    "I carry water, collect manure, herd sheep, I do everything." The landlord seemed justified.
    "Do you hoe three times and pull wheat?" The farmer asked with a sneer.
    "That's done by the hired labor." The landlord was a little embarrassed.
    "Bah! Then what kind of labor do you do!" The farmer smiled victoriously.
    I thought of my "labor" at home and could not help but feel ashamed.
    Secondly, in school, we studied "The Mass View," and admitted that everyone should "serve the people wholeheartedly," "be responsible to the people in everything," "believe that the masses liberate themselves," and "learn from the masses." But what thoughts did we have when we went to the countryside—I am a "钦差大臣" (Qinchai dachen, imperial envoy) sent by Chairman Mao, I am a hero who has come to fight for justice for the farmers.
    Because I felt that the mission was important, the work enthusiasm was not low. I preached policies to the farmers all day long until my lips were parched and my tongue was dry. At night, I had to think for a long time in bed, hoping to come up with a good way to liberate the farmers as soon as possible. But three days, five days, a week passed, where to start? Still completely clueless. Some comrades began to complain, and I, this "钦差大臣", "hero," was also a bit distressed.
    I ran to the Farmers' Association to see. The village cadres had already investigated the land and property of the landlords and rich peasants thoroughly, and were ready to "open fire" on the landlords. When they saw us, they anxiously asked: "Comrades! When are we going to start classifying classes?" At this time, I truly felt that to do work, one must follow the mass line, and must be good at mobilizing and relying on the masses, otherwise, nothing will be accomplished.
    Not long after we went to the countryside, we talked to the landlords, exhorting them earnestly to honestly bow their heads to the farmers, but the facts proved that the landlords regarded our words as the wind in their ears—those who concealed still concealed, and those who made trouble still made trouble. Only under the roar of the masses would the landlords reluctantly bow their heads to the farmers.
    At a mass meeting, Farmers' Association cadre Huang Yonghe exposed a series of crimes committed by the Jia Zhang Zhang Hongxiang. Zhang's younger sister stood up several times to defend her brother, but we repeatedly stopped her, to no avail. In the end, a chorus of voices from the masses, "Today you are only allowed to be obedient, you have no right to speak!" suppressed her.
    At this time, I truly felt that it was the masses themselves who liberated the masses, and the people's enemies could only be defeated by the people rising up.
    The day before the official class classification, Zhang Hongxiang was afraid that the masses would struggle against him, so he sent a bag of sweet potatoes to the Farmers' Association cadre Ma Guidong, hoping that Ma Guidong would help him a little; but this young cadre replied: "It's useless even if you send me ten bars of corn (ten dan of corn), let alone these sweet potatoes." After saying that, he sent all the sweet potatoes to the Farmers' Association and reported the incident to the work team.
    At this time, I saw the noble qualities of the working people, and felt that the previous ideas that "farmers are selfish" and "farmers are greedy for petty advantages" were just prejudices of the exploiting classes.
    Hearing that I studied law, an old villager sincerely asked me for advice: "I have a younger sister who is married to Song Wensheng in Banqiao. Her mother-in-law is too fierce, forcing my sister to run back home for three or four months, afraid to go back. What do you say about this?"
    "If the man agrees, then get a divorce!" I thought for a long time and replied this way, but I felt that it was not appropriate, so I added another sentence: "Let me study it and then give you a definite answer."
    A few days later, Song Wensheng and several villagers came to find us.
    "I heard that your wife wants to divorce you! What do you think?" The comrades took the opportunity to inquire.
    "Our relationship is not bad. I have no opinion, it depends on what my mother thinks." He replied.
    This made it difficult for me. I searched through the marriage laws and could not find an applicable article.
    "In my opinion, it's better to hold a forum and let both the mother-in-law and daughter-in-law make self-criticisms, and everyone can also give them suggestions on how to make the family life harmonious." Comrade Guo Ji, who had not studied law, came up with such a method.
    "Comrade Guo's idea is good, let's do it that way!" They left satisfied.
    At this time, I encountered the rich creative ability of the revolutionary masses, felt the powerlessness of the knowledge of the old world, and felt the need to start learning from scratch.
    We were assigned to eat meals at the homes of the farmers. As soon as we entered the door, they warmly welcomed us, and the room was full of voices of "Please come onto the kang! Please come onto the kang!" After eating, we gave them meal tickets, but they always firmly refused to accept them, saying: "You are working hard for us farmers to turn ourselves over. We don't have good food for you, we already feel very sorry, how can we accept meal tickets?" Only when we said: "This is the discipline of the Communist Party, the People's Government, and the Liberation Army, and we cannot violate it," would they accept them.
    The farmers are very busy during the day. In order to avoid delaying production, meetings are always held at night. In the dark night, the roads in the countryside are really difficult to walk, especially for someone like me who is nearsighted. At night, glasses seem to lose their effect and completely become blind. Every time the meeting is dismissed, the villagers always send me back, holding me with one hand to prevent me from falling, and holding a wooden stick with the other hand to prevent me from being beaten.
    At this time, I truly felt the deep feelings of the working people, and this feeling can only be consolidated and developed when we serve them wholeheartedly.
    Although, I deeply realized that: the great power of the farmer masses, the creative ability of the farmer masses, the noble qualities of the farmer masses, and the deep feelings of the farmer masses can only be brought into full play under the enlightenment, education, and leadership of the vanguard of the proletariat.
    Finally, in school, we studied "Class View," and theoretically admitted "the class nature of people," "in class society, everyone is on a certain class position to fight against other classes," "should stand on the position of the proletariat, stand on the position of the working people, and carry out irreconcilable struggle against imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism." But in reality, the class viewpoint is still very vague.
    Not long after arriving in the countryside, several students had a small dispute with the veteran cadres over the issue of attitude towards landlords and rich peasants. The cause of the matter was this: A rich peasant owed a hired laborer several shi of wages, and refused to pay it. The hired laborer complained to the work team. A veteran cadre was furious, found the rich peasant, and reprimanded him sternly, demanding that he immediately pay off the wages. Several students watched from the sidelines and were a little unaccustomed. They offered suggestions to the veteran cadre: "Why don't you reason with him properly first, why do you lose your temper at the beginning?" The veteran cadre believed that there was no need to study the issue of a kind attitude towards landlords and rich peasants at all. As long as you put heavy pressure on them, the problem would be solved.
    When I heard about this, I hesitated a bit, who was right? I couldn't figure it out.
    Later, after reading the section on "The 'Excesses' Problem" in Chairman Mao's "Report on an Investigation of the Peasant Movement in Hunan," I suddenly understood. He said: "A revolution is not a dinner party, or writing an essay, or painting a picture, or doing embroidery; it cannot be so refined, so leisurely and gentle, so '温良恭俭让' (gentle, kind, respectful, thrifty, and yielding). A revolution is an insurrection, an act of violence whereby one class overthrows another. A rural revolution is a revolution in which the peasant class overthrows the power of the feudal landlord class. If the peasants do not use great force, they will never be able to overthrow the landlord power, which has been deeply rooted for thousands of years. There must be a great revolutionary upsurge in the countryside to arouse hundreds of millions of peasant masses to form this great force. The above-mentioned excessive actions are all the power aroused by the great revolutionary upsurge in the countryside. ... All excessive actions have revolutionary significance in the second stage (revolutionary period - author's note). ... To correct something, one must go to extremes, and one cannot correct something without going to extremes."
    Of course, in today's situation, we do not need and are not allowed to tie people up, beat people, or kill people, but at least it can be said that there is no need to be polite to the enemy. Especially our work team, every move gives the farmers a great hint. If we treat everyone "equally," it is tantamount to encouraging the enemy.
    In the days that followed, I heard the farmers' complaints almost every day, heard about the crimes of the local bullies every day, and contacted people of different classes every day. By observing their words and deeds, I deeply realized that: in the countryside, due to people's different relationships to the means of production (land, draft animals, farm tools), they are indeed divided into many classes, and each class has its own desires, demands, and principles of dealing with the world. The exploiting class and the exploited class are engaged in life-and-death struggles at every moment. In this sharp class struggle, as a student said: "We only have to lean to one side, there is no third road."
    In this way, my class viewpoint was truly established.
    This is one aspect of the experience and feelings of participating in land reform work.
    On the other hand, there have been huge improvements in working methods and learning methods.
    One day after arriving in the countryside, the deputy leader Wang Xun gave me a task - to publicize the land reform policy. I thought to myself: My eloquence is pretty good in school, and I have studied "Policies and Regulations" for more than half a year. This task should be completed happily.
    After breakfast, I consulted several documents and wrote a speech. I gathered the cadres of the Farmers' Association and spoke for a full hour. At the end, I asked everyone: "Did you understand?" Everyone said: "Understood!" Comrade Wang Xun grabbed a group leader and asked: "What did Comrade Li just say? Tell me." He stared and thought for a long time, saying: "My brain is not good, I forgot everything!" Asking another person, the answer was completely irrelevant. But when Comrade Wang Xun spoke to them, they listened attentively, and before he finished speaking, some old ladies were crying and complaining, and the atmosphere of the meeting was a hundred times higher.
    In comparison, I was really a little discouraged. After returning, I asked Lao Wang what the reason was? He said: "The most important reason is: you don't understand the farmers' ideological situation, and you bluntly stuff some dogmas into their heads. They can't even hear what you're saying, so how can they remember what you said?!"
    At this time, I felt that doing things must look at the object and look at the situation, and catching sparrows with your eyes closed will never be effective in a lifetime. Remembering this lesson, I always studied the ideological situation of the masses before each speech. In less than half a month, the villagers liked to listen to my speeches. When I arrived at a place, the villagers would ask: "Comrade Li, tell us a story!"
    I admired the old cadres in everything, but there was one thing I didn't admire—I always felt that the old cadres didn't do things methodically or with a plan. Once I made a suggestion to group leader Ma Wenyun, he didn't panic and said: "If you are talking about a general plan, then the district committee has already made it, and there is no need for us to make it again. If you are talking about a specific plan, then it must be revised at any time according to the development of the work. You must never be inflexible and unchanging, because land reform is the most intense battle, and you must always estimate the changes in the enemy's situation and redeploy your forces. You probably pay too much attention to the planning of the work and ignore the flexibility." I seemed to have heard a lesson on "dialectical materialism" and felt that my brain was very mechanical and rigid.
    When I first participated in the land reform, I always thought that land reform was a solo performance, singing the changes in the relationship of land ownership and use in rural areas. But after working for a while, I felt that the problem was not so simple—in the same period, we had to publicize policies, improve farmers' class consciousness, rectify the farmers' ranks, consolidate rural power, discover and cultivate activists, and prepare to build the Party and the League at any time, mobilize the farmer masses to overthrow the feudal forces, and change the relations of production in the countryside... At the same time, these tasks are interrelated, interdependent, and mutually influential, and it is impossible to isolate them from each other, nor can they be mechanically divided into stages. At this time, I felt that land reform was not a solo performance, but a symphony, there is certainly a major instrument here, but it would not work without the cooperation of other instruments.
    In the land reform work, we truly achieved the integration of theory and practice, so that what we had learned before took root in our minds. The most obvious example is: when studying the two documents of 1933 in school, I couldn't remember them no matter how I tried, and even if I remembered them, it was not practical to classify specific households. After a month of repeated use, I not only felt that these two documents were easy to remember, but also felt that the content was extremely vivid, no longer the boring articles of the past.
    Finally, for those of us who study law, participating in land reform is tantamount to taking an enlightenment class. Only now have I experienced a part of the specific content of the new jurisprudence. Because, as Comrade He Sijing said: "The books to date never talk about the great changes in the relationship of rural land ownership and rights."
    All in all, participating in land reform is a good way for intellectuals to transform themselves, a good opportunity for intellectuals to serve the farmers, and a concrete manifestation of the integration of intellectuals and farmers.
    What I have talked about here are only personal fragmentary experiences and feelings.

　　最丰富最生动的一课
    参加京郊土改工作的心得和感想
    北京大学法律系助教  李由义
    自从京郊土改工作展开以来，我和很多人一样，盼望着有个机会参加这一伟大的运动。
    这一回，理想总算得到了实现，我跟北大法律系一百多位同学一起，参加了京郊第二批土改村的工作。
    正月五日下乡，二月六日回来，时间不算长，恰恰一个月。可是在这一个月中，我见到了许多生平所未见、闻到了许多生平所未闻的事情，增长了不少实际知识，解决了不少思想问题。自我上学以来，这恐怕是最丰富、最生动的一课了。遗憾的是：我还没有能力把这一课的内容写成文字，让大家看了如同身历其境，我只能说一说上了这一课后的一些心得和感想，让大家知道：参加土改对于一个知识分子究竟起了什么作用？
    最明显的，恐怕是对于几个马列主义的基本观点有了进一步的体会。
    首先，在学校里，我们学习过《劳动观点》，知道了《劳动创造人类》，《劳动创造世界》，《劳动人民的活动创造了历史》。然而曾经有人问我：“农民重要还是知识分子重要？”我的回答是：“很难说，各有各的重要。”曾经有人问我：“你每月拿四百斤小米，算不算多？”我的回答是：“不算多，这是起码薪水。”
    到了乡下，刚碰上交公粮。
    “你们交公粮心疼不？”我找了一个老乡问。
    “我们不交公粮你们吃啥？”他笑了笑说。
    “你们种一亩地每年可打多少粮？”我又问。
    “往年收成好，每亩可打一石多，今年地涝啦，每亩才收四、五斗。”他回答。
    我默默计算：今年四个农民，种一百亩地，辛苦一年，全部收成才够养活一个助教（然而京郊农民每人平均分不到三亩地！），想起以前的回答，我有点汗颜了。
    在家里，高兴的时候扫一回地或打一壶水，得意洋洋地问太太：“我的劳动观点怎么样？”太太说：“顶好，算得上劳动英雄。”
    在乡下，开大会划阶级。
    一个农民指着地主的鼻子问：“你说自己不是地主，你劳动了没有？”
    地主肯定地回答：“当然劳动。”
    “你劳动些什么？”农民瞪着大眼。
    “我挑水、拾粪、放羊，那样都干。”地主似乎理直气壮。
    “耪三遍、拔麦子你干不？”农民冷笑着问。
    “这个有长工干。”地主有点狼狈。
    “呸！那你还算得上什么劳动！”农民胜利地微笑。
    我想起在家里的“劳动”又不禁汗颜。
    其次，在学校里，我们学习过《群众观点》，承认每个人都应该“全心全意为人民群众服务。”“一切向人民群众负责。”“相信群众自己解放自己。”“向人民群众学习。”可是下乡时，抱着什么思想呢——我是毛主席派来的钦差大臣，我是为农民打抱不平来的英雄好汉。
    因为感到使命重大，所以工作情绪并不算低，整天舌敝唇焦地向农民宣传政策，晚上躺在炕上还要动半天脑筋，希望想出个好办法早点把农民解放。可是三天、五天、一个礼拜过去了，从何着手？还是丈二金刚摸不到头。有的同志开始闹情绪了，我这个“钦差大臣”、“英雄好汉”也有点苦恼。
    跑到农会去瞧瞧，村干部早已把地主富农的土地、财产调查得一清二楚，准备跟地主“开火”了。见了我们焦急地问：“同志！我们什么时候开始划阶级呀？”这时候，才真正感到做工作必须走群众路线，必须善于发动群众、依靠群众，否则，将一事无成。
    下乡不久，我们就找地主谈话，苦口婆心地劝他们老老实实向农民低头，可是事实证明：地主把我们的话当成耳边风——隐瞒的依然隐瞒，捣鬼的依然捣鬼。只有在群众的怒吼声下，地主老差才肯向农民低头。
    在一次群众大会上，农会干部黄永和揭发了甲长张洪祥一连串的罪行。张的妹妹好几次站起来想为乃兄辩护，我们一再制止，毫无效果。最后是群众一阵“今天只许你规规矩矩，没有你说话权利！”的呼声把她压下去。
    这时候，才真正感到解放群众的，确是群众自己，人民的敌人只有人民起来才能打得倒。
    正式划阶级的前一天，张洪祥怕群众斗他，给农会干部马贵东送了一袋白薯，希望马贵东帮他一点忙；可是这位年青的干部回答道：“你送我十条棒子（十担玉米）都没用，莫要说这一点白薯。”说罢，把白薯统通送到农会去，将这件事报告了工作组。
    这时候，我看到了劳动人民的高贵品质，而觉得以前“农民自私”、“农民贪小便宜”的想法只是剥削阶级的偏见。
    听说我是学法律的，一个老乡诚心诚意地向我请教：“我有一个妹子嫁给板桥宋文生，婆婆太凶狠了，逼得我妹子跑回家来三四个月不敢回去，你说这事怎办？”
    “假如男方同意就离婚吧！”我想了半天这么回答，但又觉得不妥当，再补充一句：“待我研究研究再给你肯定答复。”
    几天以后，宋文生和几个老乡来找我们。
    “听说你媳妇要跟你离婚啦！你觉得怎么样？”同志们乘机询问。
    “我们俩感情并不坏，我没意见，这件事要看我妈的意思怎样。”他回答。
    这可使我为难了，想遍婚姻法令找不到一条用得上的条文。
    “照我的意见不如开个座谈会，让婆媳双方都检讨检讨，大伙儿也给他们提提意见，怎样把家庭生活搞得一团和气。”没有学过法律的郭继同志想出了这么一个办法。
    “郭同志的主意好，咱们就照着办吧！”他们心满意足地走了。
    这时候，我遇到了革命群众丰富的创造能力，感到旧世界的知识之无能为力而觉得自己有从头学起的必要。
    我们在农民家里派饭，一进门他们就热烈招待，满屋子是“请上炕！请上炕！”的声音。吃完饭，给他们开饭票，他们总是坚决不收，说：“你们为着我们农民翻身受累，我们没有好饭让你们吃，已经很过意不去，那能收饭票？”一定要我们说：“这是共产党、人民政府、解放军的纪律，我们不能违背。”他们才肯接受。
    农民白天很忙，为了避免耽误生产，开会总在晚上。黑夜里，乡下的路实在不好走，特别像我这样近视的人，晚上眼镜似乎失去效用，完全变成了瞎子。每次散会总是老乡送我回去，一只手扶着我走，怕我摔交，一只手握着木棍，怕我挨揍。
    这时候，我才真正感到了劳动人民深厚的感情，而这种感情只有当我们全心全意为他们服务的时候才能巩固与发展。
    虽然，我更深切地体验到：农民群众的伟大力量、农民群众的创造能力、农民群众的高贵品质、农民群众的深厚感情，只有在无产阶级先锋队的启发、教育、领导之下才能得到高度的发挥。
    最后，在学校里，我们学习过“阶级观点”，理论上也承认“人的阶级性”，“在阶级社会里，任何人都在一定的阶级立场上与别的阶级进行斗争。”“应该站在无产阶级的立场、站在劳动人民的立场，跟帝国主义、封建主义、官僚资本主义进行不调和的斗争。”可是实际上，阶级观点还是很模糊的。
    到乡下不久，有几位同学为了对付地主、富农的态度问题，与老干部发生小小的争论。事情的起因是这样的：一个富农欠长工几石工资，抵赖不给，长工向工作组诉苦，一位老干部勃然大怒，把富农找了来，声色俱厉地训斥一顿，要他马上将工钱还清。几位同学在旁看了，有点不习惯，向老干部提意见：“为什么不先好好跟他说理，一开头就发脾气呢？”老干部则认为：对地主富农根本不必考究什么态度和蔼不和蔼的问题，只要重重压他们一下问题就解决了。
    我听到这件事，有点踌躇，到底谁对呢？老是想不通。
    后来，看到了毛主席《湖南农民运动考察报告》中“《过分》的问题”一段，才恍然大悟。他说：“革命不是请客吃饭，不是做文章，不是绘画绣花，不能那样雅致，那样从容不迫，文质彬彬，那样“温良恭俭让”。革命是暴动，是一个阶级推翻一个阶级的权力的暴烈的行动。农村革命是农民阶级推翻封建地主阶级权力的革命，农民若不用极大的力量，决不能推翻几千年根深蒂固的地主权力。农村中须有一个大的革命热潮，才能鼓动成千成万农民群众，形成这个大的力量。上面所述那些过分的举动，都是农民在农村中由大的革命热潮鼓动出来的力量。………所有一切过分的举动，在第二时期（革命时期——作者注）都有革命的意义。………矫枉必须过正，不过正不能矫枉。”
    当然，在今天的形势下，我们没有必要、也不允许捆人、打人、杀人，然而至少可以说，对敌人是用不着客气的。特别是我们工作组，一举一动都给农民很大暗示，如果“一视同仁”，就无异给敌人打了气。
    在往后的日子里，几乎每天都听到农民的诉苦，每天都听到地主恶霸的罪行，每天和不同阶级的人接触，观其言、察其行，深深地体会了：在农村中，由于人们对生产资料（土地、耕畜、农具）的关系不同，的确分成了很多阶级，每个阶级都有自己的欲望、要求、处世方针，剥削阶级和被剥削阶级每时每刻都在进行你死我活的斗争，在这种尖锐的阶级斗争中，正如一位同学所说：“我们只有一边倒，第三条道路是没有的。”
    这样，我的阶级观点才真正建立起来。
    这是参加土改工作心得和感想的一方面。
    另一方面，对于工作方法、学习方法也有巨大的改进。
    下乡后一天，副组长王勋同志给我一项任务——宣传土改政策。心里想：我在学校里口才总算不错，“政策与法令”也研究了半年多。这项任务总可以胜任愉快吧。
    吃过早饭，参考了好几种文件，写成一个演讲稿。召集农会干部，足足讲了一个多钟头，末了问大家：“听懂了没有？”大家都说：“听懂了！”王勋同志抓住一个小组长问：“刚才李同志讲了些什么？你说说看。”他瞪着眼想了半天，说：“我的脑子不行，全给忘啦！”问另一个，回答得牛头不对马嘴。可是王勋同志给他们讲话，他们都聚精会神地听，还没讲完，有些老太太就涕泪交流诉起苦来，会场情绪，高涨百倍。
    相形之下，我真有点灰心。回来后我问老王这是什么道理？他说：“最主要的原因是：你不了解农民的思想情况，生硬地把一些教条往他们脑子里塞，他们听都听不进去，那能记得你说什么？！”
    这时候，我才感到做事情必须看对象、看情况，闭着眼睛捉麻雀是一辈子也不会见效果的。记取了这个教训，嗣后每次讲话总先研究群众思想情况，不到半个月，老乡们都喜欢听我的讲话了。到了一处老乡们就要求：“李同志，给我们讲讲吧！”
    我对老干部什么事都佩服，独有一件事不佩服——总觉得老干部做事情没条理、没计划，定了计划又不照着做。有一次我特地给马文云组长提意见，他不慌不忙，说：“如果说一般计划，那区委会早已定好，用不着我们再定，如果说具体计划，那就要根据工作发展的情况随时修正，决不能刻舟求剑一成不变，因为土改是一场最激烈的战斗，随时要估计敌我形势的变化而重新配备力量。你恐怕太注重工作的计划性而忽略了灵活性。”我仿佛听了一课“辩证法唯物论”，而感到自己的脑子十分机械、呆板。
    刚参加土改时，我总认为土改是阕独奏，它歌唱出农村土地所有关系、使用关系的变更。可是搞了一阵子，就觉得问题不那么简单——我们在同一个时期内，要宣传政策、提高农民阶级觉悟，要整顿农民队伍、巩固农村政权，要发现、培养积极分子，准备随时建党建团，要发动农民群众起来打倒封建势力，改变农村的生产关系……。同时，这些工作又互相关联、互相依赖、互相影响，不可能彼此孤立，也不能机械地划分阶段。这时候，才感到土改不是一阕独奏，而是一支交响乐，这里当然有一种主要乐器，然而没有其他乐器的配合是不成的。
    在土改工作中，我们真真做到了理论联系实际而使以前所学的东西在脑子里生了根。最明显的例子是：在学校里学习一九三三年的两个文件时，怎么记也记不住，即使记住了碰到具体户也划不来，经过这一个月的反复运用，不但觉得这两个文件好记而且觉得内容无比生动，不再是以前枯燥的条文了。
    末了，对我学法学的人说来，参加土改无异上了启蒙的一课，至今我才体验到新法学具体内容的一部分。因为正如何思敬同志所说：“至今的书本是向来不谈农村土地所有权关系和权利关系的大变革的。”
    总而言之，参加土改是知识分子改造自己的好办法，是知识分子为农民服务的好机会，是知识分子与农民结合具体的表现。
    我这里所谈的只是个人一鳞半爪的心得和感想而已。
