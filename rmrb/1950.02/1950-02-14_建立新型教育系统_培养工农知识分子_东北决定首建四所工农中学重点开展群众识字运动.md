Establishing a New Education System to Cultivate Worker-Peasant Intellectuals
    Northeast Decides to First Build Four Worker-Peasant Middle Schools and Focus on Carrying Out Mass Literacy Campaigns
    [Reported by this newspaper] Northeast News: The Education Department of the Northeast People's Government convened a joint meeting of education department and bureau directors from various provinces and cities at the end of last month. Based on the spirit of the National Education Conference, the meeting discussed the following issues: vigorously cultivating worker-peasant intellectuals, establishing a new education system, continuing to transform and improve the quality of existing school education, the 1950 Northeast Region Education Work Plan, the three-year education plan outline, and education funding. At the beginning of the meeting, Deputy Minister Dong Chuncai conveyed the spirit and summary points of the National Education Conference, followed by discussions. After discussions, the comrades present deeply realized that establishing a new education system and vigorously cultivating worker-peasant intellectuals first requires raising the cultural level of worker-peasant youth participating in revolutionary work and revolutionary war, so that they can become high-level intellectual cadres in a few years, gradually changing the composition of Chinese intellectuals. This is a matter of extreme importance to the future of New China. Worker-peasant literacy movements, worker-peasant rapid middle schools, and people's universities – this series of educational initiatives constitutes a new education system. This type of education, especially the mass literacy movement and middle-level cadre schools, has achieved great success and accumulated rich experience in the liberated areas over the past twenty years, thanks to the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the People's Government. Today, we should develop and improve it in a more planned way on this basis.
    The meeting discussed the 1950 Northeast Region Education Plan. The plan stipulates that in addition to continuing to transform and improve existing school education, the main points are as follows: 1. Focus on carrying out literacy campaigns to gain experience for widespread promotion in the future. 2. Four worker-peasant rapid middle schools will be established in the first half of the year (two in Shenyang, and one each in Dalian and Harbin). 3. In order to meet construction needs and cultivate a large number of cadres, secondary technical schools and senior high schools will be developed. 4. It is proposed to request the Northeast People's Government to establish the Northeast People's University to cultivate new-type intellectual cadres.
    The meeting lasted four days. Liu Zhiming, Deputy Director of the Propaganda Department of the Northeast Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, attended and spoke on the day before the closing. He explained the relationship between cultural and educational work and economic construction. He also emphasized that the establishment of worker-peasant rapid middle schools and the focused implementation of literacy campaigns have special and important significance today. The Propaganda Department of the Northeast Bureau and the propaganda departments of various provincial and municipal Party committees should attach importance to and assist in this work.

　　建立新型教育系统  培养工农知识分子
    东北决定首建四所工农中学重点开展群众识字运动
    【本报讯】东北消息：东北人民政府教育部于上月底召开各省市教育厅、教育局长联席会议，依据全国教育会议精神，讨论下列问题：大力培养工农知识分子，建立新型教育系统，继续改造与提高现有学校教育质量，一九五○年东北区教育工作计划，三年教育计划大纲和教育经费等。会议首由董纯才副部长传达了全国教育会议的精神和总结要点，继即进行讨论。与会同志经讨论后都深刻地认识到：建立新型教育系统，大力培养工农知识分子，首先是提高参加革命工作和革命战争的工农青年的文化程度，使他们在数年之后，成为高级知识分子干部，逐渐改变中国知识分子的成分，这是对新中国前途极关重要的问题。工农识字运动、工农速成中学和人民大学，这一系列的教育就是新型教育系统。这种教育，特别是群众识字运动和中级干部学校，在过去二十年中，由于中国共产党和人民政府的领导，在解放区已获得很大成绩，积累了丰富的经验。今天应该在这个基础上更有计划地去发展它，提高它。
    会议讨论了一九五○年东北区教育计划。计划中规定除继续改造与提高现有学校教育之外，主要的有下列各点：一、有重点地开展识字运动，借以取得经验，将来普遍推行。二、工农速成中学将于上半年成立四所（沈阳二所，大连、哈尔滨各一所）。三、为适应建设需要，大批培养干部，将发展中等技术学校和高级中学。四、拟提请东北人民政府成立东北人民大学，培养新型知识分子干部。
    会议共历四日结束。中共中央东北局宣传部刘芝明副部长于结束前一日到会讲话。他说明了文化教育工作与经济建设的关系。并强调指出：建立工农速成中学和有重点地开展识字运动，在今天已具有特殊重要的意义。东北局宣传部与各省市委宣传部要重视与协助这一工作。
