　　Beijing Film Studio News Photography Team Films Science Exhibition Film
　　To Be Shown on Tour Throughout Urban and Rural Areas
    [Reported by this newspaper] Yesterday (the 23rd) was the seventh day of the Beijing Spring Festival Science Exhibition, with 7,723 visitors. Commanders and fighters of a certain tank regiment of the People's Liberation Army came from dozens of miles away to visit, arriving at the venue as early as 9:00 AM. They particularly carefully viewed the "From Ape to Man" section of the exhibition and plan to hold discussions in conjunction with their social development history studies upon their return. The News Photography Team of the News Department of the Beijing Film Studio specially came to the exhibition yesterday morning to film. According to Chen Yifan of the team, in order to meet the needs of the broad masses of working people, they focused their filming on the "Maternal and Child Health" section. Based on the thematic materials in the exhibition hall, they will also go to nurseries to film some children's activities, producing a short, systematic educational film to be shown on tour in cities, villages, and factories across the country, so that scientific knowledge can be disseminated to the working class and peasantry. To complement this exhibition, Beijing People's Broadcasting Station invited Professor Pei Wenzhong yesterday afternoon at 1:00 PM to broadcast "About From Ape to Man." Many spectators who had not yet entered the exhibition hall gathered in front of the loudspeakers to listen quietly.

　　北京电影制片厂新闻摄影队昨拍摄科展影片
　　将在全国城乡巡回放映
    【本报讯】昨（二十三日）为北京市春节科学展览第七日，观众达七千七百二十三人。人民解放军战车某团指战员从数十里外赶来参观，于上午九时就到达会场。他们特别仔细地看了展览会的“从猿到人”部分，并准备回去后配合他们的社会发展史学习举行讨论。北京电影制片厂新闻处新闻摄影队特于昨日上午至展览会拍摄影片。据该队陈一帆谈，为了适应广大劳动人民的需要，他们把拍摄重点放在“妇幼卫生”部分，并将根据展览室内的主题材料，再到托儿所去拍摄一些孩子们的活动，摄制成为一个短短的有系统的教育影片，拿到全国各城市、乡村、工厂中巡回放映，使科学知识能推广到工农群众中去。北京人民广播电台为配合此次展览会，昨日下午一点曾请裴文中教授播讲“关于从猿到人”。许多还没有进入展览会场的观众，都聚拢在扩音器前静静地收听。
