Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, February 21st: A Dentsu News Agency dispatch from Hong Kong on the 17th reported that the US government is placing massive orders for military equipment with Japanese war industries. "Mitsubishi Corporation" will manufacture the largest caliber long-range cannons, anti-tank guns, and various types of light weapons for the United States. Simultaneously, the company's shipyards have already begun fulfilling a contract to repair 86 warships formerly belonging to the Japanese Navy. According to the demands of the US government, these warships, which only require minor repairs or the addition of war equipment according to American personnel instructions, must be repaired in the shortest possible time and handed over to the Japanese "Maritime Safety Agency" established in 1948. This agency is currently training officers and cadres for the future Japanese Navy.

　　"Japan Explosives Company" has received American orders for the manufacture of gunpowder, explosives, mines, and chemical products. "Ishikawajima Company" has received large orders for the manufacture of light and heavy tanks and armored vehicles.

　　The scale of American orders is such that these three large companies, whose war production capacity remained intact under the American occupation, will expand their production capacity to fulfill the massive American orders.

　　Before these American orders were placed with Japanese military industries, high-ranking officers of MacArthur's headquarters held secret discussions with Japanese militarists. During these meetings, they discussed the production capacity of Japanese arms concerns and the supply of raw materials for manufacturing weapons. Once these two points were agreed upon, the United States immediately submitted the orders. These orders were clearly prepared by military experts in Washington. Japanese weapons will be produced according to American plans and under the supervision of American officers. The new weapons produced by Japanese arsenals will be given, on the one hand, to the million-strong new Japanese Army currently being planned by the United States on the basis of so-called "police forces," and, on the other hand, to the armies of the satellite states of US Imperialism in Southeast Asia.

　　The urgency with which the United States insists on completing the orders can be illustrated by the following situation: in the first half of this year, 450,000 new members of the Japanese "police force" must be armed.

　　疯狂准备新侵略战争
    美帝向日定购大量军火       
    新武器将交给美帝计划组织的百万新日本陆军及附庸国军队
    【新华社北京二十一日电】电通社香港十七日讯：美国政府正向日本战争工业定购大量军事装备。“三菱公司”将给美国制造最大口径的长射程大炮、反坦克炮及各种类型的轻武器。同时，该公司的船坞业已开始履行修理属于前日本海军的八十六艘军舰的合同。根据美国政府的要求，这些仅需稍加修理或根据美国人员的指示添置战争装备的军舰，须在最短时间内，修理完竣，并移交给一九四八年成立的日本“海上保安厅”，这个保安厅正在训练未来日本海军的军官与干部。
    “日本火药公司”已收到制造火药、炸药、地雷及化学品的美国定单。“石川岛公司”收到了制造轻重坦克及装甲车的大批定单。
    美国的定单已到了这样的规模，以致这三个战争生产能力在美国占领下仍然完好无损的大公司，为了履行美国的大量定货，将扩大生产力。
    在这些美国定单交给日本军火工业之前，麦克阿瑟参谋部的高级军官与日本军阀之间进行过秘密讨论。他们在这些会议上讨论了日本军火康采恩的生产力和制造武器的原料供给问题。当这两点达成协议后，美国随即提出了定单。这些定单显然是由华盛顿军事专家准备好的。日本的武器将依照美国的计划，并在美国军官的监督之下生产。日本兵工厂生产的新武器，一方面交给现在由美国以所谓“警察队”为基础而计划的一百万新日本陆军，另一方面交给美国附庸国——东南亚傀儡国家的军队。
    美国坚持完成定货的急促，可由下面的情况说明，即：在今年上半年，必须武装四十五万新的日本“警察队”的队员。
