Supporting the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance
All Circles in the Country are Excited and Encouraged
Supporting the Sino-Soviet Brotherly Alliance
Zhang Bojun

　　Today, Beijing, the capital of the Chinese people, and Moscow, the capital of the socialist state of the Soviet Union, simultaneously formally announced the conclusion of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance, and signed agreements on the Chinese Changchun Railway, Lushun and Dalian, and loans. This is a great event of historical significance. As Soviet Foreign Minister Vyshinsky said, "The news of the signing of these documents will not only be deeply satisfying to all the people of the Soviet Union, but also to all friends of peace, democracy and progress."

　　Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, the Chinese people defeated the imperialist group headed by U.S. imperialism that invaded China, and eliminated the feudal landlords and the ruling group of bureaucratic compradors. The emerging people's unified democratic regime has been established. All democratic classes and all democratic parties throughout the country are firmly united under the banner of Mao Zedong, and are making their greatest efforts towards the goals of defending peace, promoting democracy, restoring production, developing culture, and eliminating the last remaining enemies. Under such a new situation and on such a new foundation, the revolutionary friendship between China and the Soviet Union has been more closely and firmly combined by Marshal Stalin and Chairman Mao.

　　From the signing of this great new treaty, the Chinese people will gain some basic understanding and enhance their revolutionary beliefs!

　　1. The tricks of rumor-mongering, provocation, and discord used by U.S. imperialism, attempting to split the Chinese people and undermine Sino-Soviet friendly cooperation, such as Acheson's various unfounded and malicious slanders against Sino-Soviet relations not long ago, and the illusions of creating a "Chinese Tito" by British and American politicians, hooligans, and sabotage agents, are now, after the counter-evidence of such a great event, all imperialists have completely and thoroughly failed in any policy and all kinds of conspiracies that endanger the Chinese revolution and the interests of the Chinese people.

　　2. After the signing of this Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance and related agreements, the people of China will deeply feel the following facts: the Chinese people will never be isolated; the Chinese revolutionary cause, from the implementation of people's democracy to the development of socialism, is absolutely guaranteed; the economic revival of China, the development of production, and the transformation and improvement of culture and technology will inevitably receive rapid and multiple assistance. At the same time, we also deeply know that the Soviet people must feel excited and happy that such a country with a vast territory, abundant resources, and a population of 470 million, is united with the socialist state of the Soviet Union. Because the combination of these two great countries is an unprecedented and unparalleled world revolutionary force, it not only has a decisive role in defending world democracy and peace, but it also undoubtedly guarantees the security of the Soviet Union and helps the development of Soviet communist construction.

　　We know that U.S. imperialists will feel panicked and at a loss over the conclusion of the new treaty between China and the Soviet Union. They may lose their minds and more frantically help the remnant bandit Chiang Kai-shek to carry out sabotage of the construction of the new China, and may even use Japanese war criminals "Emperor" and Quirino, Bao Dai, Plaek Phibunsongkhram, and Syngman Rhee to form a Pacific reactionary group to undermine the Chinese revolution; however, we firmly believe that the power of the Chinese people, combined with the power of the Soviet Union, will surely be able to defeat them.

　　Finally, we, the Chinese people, especially the democratic parties, must have a deep understanding of this great agreement, carry out extensive publicity, and make it the content of internationalist education; we must thank Chairman Mao and Premier Zhou for their wise decisions and hard work, and similarly, we must thank Marshal Stalin and the Soviet people.

　　拥护中苏友好同盟互助条约
    全国各界兴奋鼓舞
    拥护中苏兄弟同盟
    章伯钧
    中国人民的首都北京，和社会主义国家苏联的首都莫斯科，今天同时正式宣布中苏两国缔结友好同盟互助条约，并签订关于中国长春铁路、旅顺口及大连和贷款等协定，这是一个伟大的有历史意义的事件。诚如苏联外交部长维辛斯基所说：“这几个文件的签订的消息，不仅将得到全苏联的人民，同时也将得到所有和平、民主与进步的友人们的深深的满意。”
    中国人民在中国共产党及毛主席领导下，击败了以美帝为首的侵略中国的帝国主义集团，消灭了封建地主，和官僚买办的统治集团。新兴的人民的统一的民主政权，已经建立起来，全国各民主阶层和所有民主党派，都坚强的在毛泽东旗帜之下团结起来，正向着保卫和平，发扬民主，恢复生产，发展文化，和消灭最后的残余敌人等目标，尽其最大的努力。在这样的新形势之下和新基础之上，把中苏两国之间的革命的友谊，由斯大林大元帅和毛主席，更密切地更巩固地结合起来了。
    中国人民从这次伟大的新条约的签订，将得到一些基本的认识和增强革命的信念！
    一、美帝国主义所使用的造谣挑拨和离间的诡计，企图分裂中国人民和破坏中苏友好的合作，像艾奇逊在不久以前，对于中苏关系所制造的种种无稽恶劣的诽谤，又如英美两国的政客流氓和特务破坏分子，希图制造“中国铁托”的幻想，现在经过这样伟大事件的反证，一切帝国主义者，对于危害中国革命，和中国人民利益的任何政策以及各种各样的阴谋，都是完全彻底地失败了。
    二、从这次友好同盟互助条约及有关的协定签订以后，中国的人民将深深地感觉到以下的事实：中国的人民是永远不会孤立的，中国的革命事业，由人民民主主义的实行到社会主义的发展，是绝对有保障的，中国经济的复兴，生产的开拓，和文化技术的改造与提高，也必然的获得迅速地和多种地协助。同时，我们也深切的知道，苏联人民对于这样一个地大物博，有四万万七千万人口的国家，与社会主义的国家苏联结合在一起，是一定感到兴奋和愉快的。因为这两个伟大国家的结合，是一种空前无比的世界革命力量，它不仅对于保卫世界民主和平具有决定性的作用，就是对于保障苏联的安全，和有助于苏联共产主义建设的发展，也是无疑义的。
    我们知道美帝国主义者，对于中苏两国缔结新的条约，是会感到惊慌失措的，他们也许丧失理智，更加疯狂的帮助残匪蒋介石，来进行破坏新中国的建设，也许更要利用日本战犯“天皇”和季里诺、保大、銮披汶和李承晚等组成太平洋反动集团来破坏中国革命；但是，我们坚决地相信，中国人民的力量，和苏联的力量结合在一起，是一定能够击败他们的。
    最后，我们中国人民，特别是各民主党派，对于这个伟大的协定，要有深刻的认识，要作广泛的宣传，成为国际主义教育的内容；我们要感谢毛主席和周总理的英明决策和辛劳，同样地我们要感谢斯大林大元帅和苏联人民的。
