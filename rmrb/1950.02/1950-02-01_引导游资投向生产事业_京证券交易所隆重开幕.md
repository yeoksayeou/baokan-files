Guiding Idle Capital Towards Productive Enterprises
	Beijing Securities Exchange Grandly Opens

[Beijing News] The Beijing Securities Exchange opened yesterday (the 31st) and will begin trading today. Those present at the opening ceremony yesterday included Cheng Hongyi, Deputy Director of the Municipal Government Finance Committee; Peng Cheng, Deputy Director of the Commercial Bureau; Zhang Naiqi, Member of the Central Finance Committee; Qian Jiaju, Deputy Director of the Central Private Enterprise Bureau; Jia Xingwu, Manager of the Beijing Branch of the People's Bank of China; Ling Qijun, Vice Chairman of the Beijing Municipal Democratic National Construction Association; Han Songshang, representative of the Federation of Industry and Commerce; other representatives from industrial and commercial circles; and brokers. At the meeting, Gao Zuoquan, Director of the Securities Exchange, first delivered an opening speech, followed by Jia Xingwu, Manager of the Branch Bank, who reported on the preparatory process, explaining that the establishment of the Beijing Securities Exchange was to implement the resolution of the Second Beijing Municipal People's Representative Conference. He also stated that the purpose of opening a securities exchange under the New Democratic economic policy was to "guide idle capital, develop production, encourage investment, and prosper the economy." In his speech, Zhang Naiqi expressed his hope that private enterprises in Beijing, after resolving business and technical difficulties, would gradually bring their stocks to the market for trading. Only in this way could the securities exchange achieve its mission of promoting the development of productive enterprises in Beijing and attracting funds from other regions to invest in the capital's production and construction. He encouraged brokers to learn and progress, to understand the government's policies and regulations, the development prospects and business conditions of each enterprise, and their financial status, so as to become investment advisors for the general public. Deputy Director Cheng Hongyi pointed out in his speech that the Beijing Securities Exchange is fundamentally different from the securities exchanges of the past, which were dedicated to speculation. The purpose of establishing the Beijing Securities Exchange this time is to absorb idle capital and direct it towards productive enterprises. The reason why securities exchanges became places for speculative activities in the past was inseparable from the old regime and the old system. Today, under the New Democratic economic policy and the leadership of the People's Government, the new securities exchange is believed to be able to play its due role in promoting productive enterprises. Qian Jiaju stated in his speech that he hoped the Beijing Securities Exchange could play a model role in attracting capital for investment and construction. Continuing to speak were Ling Qijun, Han Songshang, and Liang Zhengfu, Vice Chairman of the Qianye Association, who stated that the establishment of the securities exchange could bring a portion of idle capital into the right track, preventing it from causing trouble in the commodity market and benefiting price stability. Liang Zhengfu also believed that the new securities exchange is not about competition in trading but about the business competition of the companies represented by the listed stocks. The exchange is a barometer of how the enterprise is operating. Finally, Chen Jixuan, the representative of the brokers, spoke, stating that he would engage in legal and reasonable transactions under the leadership of the government to realize the government's policies.

　　引导游资投向生产事业
    京证券交易所隆重开幕
    【北京讯】北京市证券交易所昨（三十一）日开幕，今日起开始交易。昨日开幕时，出席的有市政府财委会副主任程宏毅，商业局副局长彭城，中央财委会委员章乃器，中央私营企业局副局长千家驹，中国人民银行北京分行经理贾星五，北京市民建会副理事长凌其峻，工商联合会代表韩诵裳和其他工商界代表及经纪人等。会上，首由证券交易所主任高作权致开幕词，接着由分行经理贾星五报告筹备经过，说明北京市证券交易所的成立是执行北京市第二届各界代表会的决议。并说明在新民主主义的经济政策下开办证券交易所的目的是为了“引导游资，发展生产，奖励投资，繁荣经济”。章乃器讲话中希望北京市的私人企业在解决业务上和技术上的困难后，能够把股票逐渐地到市场来开拍，这样才能使证券交易所达到促进北京市生产事业发展的任务，并吸引其他各地的资金投资于首都的生产建设事业。他勉励经纪人学习、进步，要明了政府的政策法令，每个企业的发展前途和营业情形、财产状况，使自己成为一般人民投资的顾问。程宏毅副主任讲话时指出：北京市证券交易所和过去专门从事投机的证券交易所是有着本质上的不同，这次北京市证券交易所的成立，目的就在于吸收游资，投向生产事业。过去证券交易所之所以成为投机活动的地方，是与过去的旧政权旧制度分不开的；而今天在新民主主义的经济政策和人民政府领导下，新的证券交易所对生产事业相信它能够发挥应有的作用。千家驹在讲话中表示：希望北京市证券交易所在吸收资金投资建设方面能起个模范作用。继续讲话的有凌其峻、韩诵裳、钱业公会副理事长梁征甫等，他们表示：证券交易所的设立可以使一部分游资纳入正轨，不再向商品市场上兴风作浪，对物价稳定也是有好处的。梁征甫并认为新的证券交易不是在交易上的竞争而是上市的股票所代表的公司在业务上的竞争，企业经营的情形如何，交易所就是它的气压表。最后由经纪人代表陈季萱讲话，他表示要在政府的领导下，从事合法合理的交易，来实现政府的政策。
