　　Warsaw, February 22 (Xinhua News Agency) – On the occasion of the 32nd anniversary of the founding of the Soviet Army, Polish Defense Minister Marshal Rokossovsky sent a telegram of congratulations to Soviet Armed Forces Minister Marshal Vasilevsky. The telegram reads as follows: On behalf of the entire Polish Army and myself personally, I extend my heartfelt congratulations and best wishes to you and all the heroic soldiers of the Soviet Armed Forces under your command. Under the command of the great strategist Marshal Stalin, the Soviet Army, in the historical war that liberated the Soviet Union and many other nations in the world from fascist aggressors, has already demonstrated its high combat, political, and spiritual qualities in practical action. The Polish nation and the Polish Army will always remember that it was only due to the power and heroism of the Soviet Army that Fascism and Hitlerism were extinguished; it was only thanks to the Soviet Army that our country was able to restore genuine independence and have the opportunity to develop peacefully in all aspects towards socialism through the people's democratic regime. We will continuously strengthen and deepen the comradeship-in-arms that connects the Polish Army and the invincible Soviet Army. The indestructible alliance between the Polish nation and the Soviet nationalities, established through bloodshed and sacrifice in joint combat, as well as the comradeship-in-arms between the Soviet and Polish armies, constantly encourages us and fills us with unwavering belief and confidence: only by following this path can we Poles obtain guarantees for the security and freedom of our motherland, and guarantees for world peace.
