　　Tsinghua Teachers and Students Use Winter Vacation
    to Conduct Systematic Political Study
    Peking University Engineering School Students to Visit Various Factories
    [Our Newspaper] In order to organize the vast number of teachers and students to conduct systematic political study during the winter vacation, the Tsinghua University Student Union, the Faculty and Staff Union, the Communist Youth League, and the Large Class Committee jointly formed the Winter Vacation Study Committee. The winter vacation study will be centered on youth lectures. The first part of the youth lectures is the study of "Domestic and International Situation," divided into three lectures: international situation, domestic situation, and how to read newspapers; the second part is "The Communist Youth League and Youth Self-Cultivation," including understanding the Communist Youth League (two lectures), youth's own problems, reading methods and thinking methods, and literary and art issues. The content of the lectures is determined according to the needs of the vast number of students. Since the ideological summary held last semester, students have initially established a worldview of serving the people. However, they have done relatively little in terms of current affairs study and it has not been systematic. Many students do not have the habit of regularly reading newspapers and discussing political issues; there is a lack of an atmosphere of publicizing and adhering to correct political opinions and criticizing incorrect political opinions. Therefore, the study of the domestic and international situation will be carried out first during this winter vacation. At the same time, Tsinghua University currently has more than 1,100 Communist Youth League members, and many students are applying to join the League. There is an urgent need to strengthen their understanding of the Communist Youth League and improve their consciousness in order to consolidate their own organization. Therefore, "The Communist Youth League and Youth Self-Cultivation" is designated as the second main content of the youth lectures. In addition, the Winter Vacation Study Committee also publishes a "Study Newspaper" to guide students' study.

    [Our Newspaper] During the winter vacation, students from all departments of the Engineering College of Peking University, under the principle of "half study, half rest" proposed by the Student Union, have launched various activities. In addition to participating in youth lectures, studying, and various cultural and recreational activities, second-year students of the Department of Mechanical Engineering, feeling that their self-study of political courses last semester was not enough, want to seize this vacation to intensify their political study. They have selected documents such as "On New Democracy," "The Chinese Revolution and the Chinese Communist Party," and "On the People's Democratic Dictatorship" as basic materials for study. Three fourth-year students in the department went to the Beijing-Tianjin Railway Bureau to learn how to drive trains after the start of the vacation. Another group of students and teachers have drawn up mechanical design assignments for the winter vacation. In addition to making up notes, doing exercises, and previewing, they also plan to visit the tram factory once. The third-year students plan to visit the 70th Ordnance Factory, Changxindian Locomotive Factory, Tongxian Power Plant, and Daqiao Tram Factory. Fourth-year students of the Department of Electrical Engineering have visited and are preparing to visit Housheng Match Factory, Yanjing Paper Mill, Tongxian Power Plant, and Shuangqiao Radio Station. Third-year students of the Department of Civil Engineering are preparing to visit the Jiaotong University structural model, the Qianmen Station facilities, etc. (North Engineering Correspondence Group)

　　清华师生利用寒假
    进行系统政治学习
    北大工学院同学将参观各厂
    【本报讯】为了组织广大师生在寒假中进行有系统的政治学习，清华大学学生会、教职联、青年团和大课委员会联合组成了寒假学习委员会。寒假学习以青年讲座为中心进行。青年讲座第一部分是“国内外形势”的学习，分国际情势、国内形势和怎样读报三讲；第二部分是“青年团与青年修养”，包括认识青年团（共两讲）、青年切身问题、读书方法与思想方法、文艺问题。讲座的内容，都是根据广大同学的需要而决定的。自上学期举行思想总结以来，同学们初步建立了为人民服务的人生观。但在时事学习方面作得比较少，而且没有系统。很多同学没有经常看报和讨论政治问题的习惯；缺乏宣传并坚持正确的政治意见批判不正确的政治意见的风气。因此，此次寒假期间首先进行国内外形势学习。同时，清华大学目前已有青年团员一千一百多名，还有许多同学正在申请入团。亟待加强他们对青年团的认识，提高自觉，以巩固青年自己的组织。所以“青年团与青年修养”定为青年讲座的第二个主要内容。此外，寒假学委会并举办了“学习报”，以指导同学学习。

    【本报讯】寒假期中，北京大学工学院各级系同学在学生会提出的“一半学习一半休息”的原则下，展开了各种活动。除参加青年讲座、温书和各种文化娱乐活动外，机械系二年级同学因感到上学期政治课的自学不够，要抓紧这个假期加紧政治学习。他们选了“新民主主义论”、“中国革命与中国共产党”、“论人民民主专政”等文件做学习的基本材料。该系四年级有三位同学放假后便到京津路局学开火车。另一部分同学和教师订出了寒假里机械设计的作业。除去补笔记、作习题以及预习外，还准备到电车厂参观一次。三年级准备参观七十兵工厂、长辛店机车厂以及通县发电厂和大桥电车厂。电机系四年级参观了和预备参观厚生火柴厂、燕京造纸厂、通县发电厂及双桥电台等。土木系三年级预备参观交大结构模型、前门车站设备等。（北工通讯组）
