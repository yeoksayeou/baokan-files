Labor Model Zhang Laifa Murdered by Bandit Planes

Labor model Zhang Laifa, a coppersmith in the No. 2 furnace room of the Shanghai Electric Power Company (hereinafter referred to as "Shanghai Electric"), was 56 years old this year. He worked at Shanghai Electric for 32 years and was highly skilled. On the 6th of this month, he was seriously injured and died under the rampage of the American-Chiang bandit planes. Upon hearing of his death, the workers of Shanghai Electric devoted themselves to the rescue effort with heavy hearts. They wrote on large wall posters: "Firmly remember this blood debt! Overcome difficulties, do our best to generate electricity, support the front lines, resolutely, thoroughly, and completely eliminate all Chiang bandit remnants in China, strike directly at the bandit den, and liberate Taiwan!"

When it comes to Zhang Laifa, they all unanimously recall his heroic and exemplary action in repairing the No. 3 boiler.

A few months ago, the grate broke. According to convention, repairing the grate required stopping the fire first, because the boiler had a high temperature of 600 degrees. However, stopping the fire would take two or three days to repair, which would cause some factories to stop production due to power outages, affecting production. At this time, Master Zhang Laifa demonstrated a new labor attitude and proposed his own solution to the engineers. His method was: wear two sets of wet cotton clothes, and then put on wet burlap sacks, and crawl in to repair. At the time, some engineers were not very confident in this method, but they finally agreed under Zhang Laifa's enthusiasm.

Zhang Laifa himself took the lead, leading several workers, wearing wet clothes in the high temperature of 600 degrees, drying out and re-soaking them, crawling in and out several times. Finally, the grate was repaired in two hours. This reduced a significant loss to the company and also allowed many factories to continue production without stopping. Due to this heroic and exemplary action, the workers of the entire plant awarded him the glorious title of "Labor Model".

On the 6th, when bandit planes bombed Shanghai, he remained calm and stood at his post, sticking to his work. Unfortunately, he was penetrated in the liver by fragments of an American-made bomb, and the tendons and bones of his legs and left arm were also broken by shrapnel. He was immediately taken to the Second Labor Hospital, where he died at 8:30 a.m. on the 8th. When he was carried into the hospital, he was still delirious, shouting, "I want to go to work! I want to go to work!"

His eldest son, Zhang Dinghai, also works at Shanghai Electric, and Zhang Zhonghua and Zhang Yonghua are still in school.

Labor model Zhang Laifa was seriously injured and died in the bombing, which is one of the bloody crimes of the American imperialists and the Chiang bandit gang. The workers from Shanghai Electric and various factories who went to express their condolences paid the highest respect to this old worker who gloriously sacrificed his life! They shouted loudly in front of the deceased's coffin: "Blood debts must be paid in blood!" "Swear to avenge the dead!"

　　被匪机杀害的劳动模范张来发
    上海电力公司（以下简称“上电”）二号炉子间的劳动模范张来发师傅，是个铜匠工人，今年五十六岁，在上电做了三十二年工，有一手好技艺。他在本月六日美帝蒋匪的匪机肆虐下，受重伤而殉职了。上电的工友听到他的死难，都以沉痛心情投入了抢救运动。他们在大幅墙报上写着：“牢牢记住这笔血债！战胜困难，尽力发电，支援前线，坚决、彻底、干净的消灭中国境内一切蒋匪残余势力，直捣匪窝，解放台湾！”
    谈起张来发，他们都一致回想起修理三号锅炉的英勇模范行动。
    几月前炉排坏了，照惯例要修理炉排必须先停火，因为锅炉有六百度高热。但是停下火来须要二三天才能修好，那就要使一些工厂因断电而停工影响生产。这时候张来发师傅就发挥了新的劳动态度，向工程师提出了自己的办法。他的办法是：身上着二套打湿水的棉衣，外边再披上湿麻袋，爬进去修理。当时一些工程师还不十分信任这个办法的，但在张来发热诚下终于答允了。
    张来发自己领头带着几个工友，在六百度的高温下穿了湿衣进去，烤干了出来又再浸湿，这样钻进去爬出来好几次，终于在二个钟头内把炉排修好。减少了公司一笔很大的损失，同时也使许多工厂能继续生产不停工。由于这个英勇模范行动，全厂工人赠给了他“劳动模范”光荣的称号。
    六日那天匪机轰炸上海，他镇静如故，站在自己岗位上坚持工作。但不幸，他被美制炸弹片穿入肝脏，两腿和左臂也都被弹片打断了筋骨。立刻他被抬到第二劳工医院，在八日上午八时半不治身死。在抬进医院时，他还发着呓语，高喊着“我要上班去！我要上班去！”
    他的大儿子张定海也在上电做工，张忠华、张永华还在上学。
    劳动模范张来发被炸重伤惨死了，这是美帝和蒋匪帮灭绝人性的血淋淋罪行之一。上电和各厂前去慰问的工人，都向这个光荣殉职的老工人致最崇高的敬意！他们曾在死者的灵前高喊：“血债要用血来还”！“誓为死者复仇”！
