　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, February 24th: The Yan'an County People's Congress, elected through universal suffrage, was held from January 23rd to 27th. The meeting listened to, discussed, and approved County Head Shi Ji Quan's report on the government's work over the past year and the 1950 production and cultural construction plan. It also elected the County Head and Deputy County Head of the Yan'an County People's Government, the members of the County People's Government Committee, and the President of the County People's Court. The Yan'an County People's Congress was convened after universal suffrage was conducted on the basis that military operations in the area had completely ended, the land reform had been thoroughly implemented, and the people from all walks of life had been fully organized. As early as late November of last year, the county established an election committee to prepare for the county and township-level universal suffrage. When the universal suffrage work began, the election regulations were first widely publicized, voters were registered household by household, and electoral districts were divided according to the number of residents and the size of villages. Subsequently, the masses were mobilized to examine the work of the government, and on this basis, candidates for the county and township-level people's representatives were deliberated and proposed. After being reviewed and approved by the county and township election committees, people's representatives at the county and township levels were elected by means of secret ballot. A total of 59 formal county representatives and 8 alternate representatives were elected, including representatives from all strata such as workers, farmers, women, education circles, business circles, enlightened gentry, and representatives from Party and government organs. Before the meeting, the representatives widely solicited the people's opinions on the work of the government, drafted various proposals, and submitted them to the meeting for discussion. The meeting proceeded for five days in an atmosphere of democracy and unity. Cui Tianfu, Acting Director of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region Administrative Office, and Li Jingying, Deputy Secretary of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region Committee of the Communist Party of China, were invited to attend and speak. The delegates to the congress held group discussions on County Head Shi Jiquan's report, carefully pointed out the advantages and disadvantages of the government's work in the past year, and conscientiously reviewed the 1950 production and cultural construction plan. For example, the original plan for the Yaodian District of the county was to plant 1,400 mu of cotton this year. The representatives proposed that the district had many river terraces, the land was fertile, and the farmers had experience in planting cotton, so the area for planting cotton should be increased. After detailed discussion, it was increased to 1,650 mu. The congress also discussed and adopted ten proposals related to cultural and educational construction, etc. Finally, the congress elected Shi Jiquan (the original county head) as county head, Bu Jifu as deputy county head, and Shi Jiquan, Hu Qilin, Yang Buhao, He Honghai, Zhang Shulin, Han Derong, and five others as members of the Yan'an County People's Government Committee, and Xu Zunren as President of the Yan'an County People's Court by means of secret ballot.

　　延安举行人民代表大会
    选出正副县长、县人民政府委员会及县人民法院院长
    【新华社延安二十四日电】经过普选的延安县人民代表大会，已于上月二十三日至二十七日举行。会议听取、讨论并通过了史纪全县长的一年来政府各项工作报告和一九五○年生产及文化建设计划，并选举了延安县人民政府正、副县长，县人民政府委员会及县人民法院院长。延安县人民代表大会是在该地区军事行动已经完全结束，土地改革已经彻底实现，各界人民已有充分组织的基础上进行普选后召开的。这是西北地区的第一个县人民代表大会。早在去年十一月下旬，该县即成立了选举委员会，筹备县乡两级普选。普选工作开始时，首先普遍地宣传了选举条例，逐户登记选民，以居民人口之多少与村庄之大小划分选区。接着，发动群众检查政府工作，并在这个基础上，酝酿和提出了县乡两级人民代表的候选人名单，经县与乡的选举委员会审查批准后，以无记名投票选举方式选出县乡两级人民代表。全县共选出正式县代表五十九名，候补代表八名。包括了工人、农民、妇女、教育界、工商界、开明士绅等各阶层代表和党、政机关代表。大会举行前，各代表广泛地征求了人民对政府工作的意见，拟出各种提案，交付大会讨论，会议在民主团结的气氛中进行了五天。陕北行政公署代主任崔田夫，中共陕北区委员会副书记李景膺均被邀出席讲话。大会代表对于史纪全县长的报告进行了分组讨论，仔细地指出了过去一年来政府工作的优缺点，并认真地审核了一九五○年的生产及文化建设计划。如该县姚店区原计划今年植棉一千四百亩，代表们提出该区川地多，地又肥，农民有植棉经验，应该增加植棉面积，经详细讨论后，增至一千六百五十亩。大会并讨论和通过了有关文教建设等十个提案。大会最后用无记名投票方式选出史纪全（原县长）为县长，卜吉甫为副县长，史纪全、胡起林、杨步浩、贺鸿海、张树林、韩德荣等十一人为县人民政府委员会委员，徐遵仁为延安县人民法院院长。
