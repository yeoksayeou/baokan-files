　　Day of Struggle Against the Colonial System

　　The American imperialists stand at the forefront of suppressing the resistance movements of the Asian colonial peoples, openly supporting their partners, the British, French, and Dutch imperialists, in their armed attacks on Asian colonies, supporting those traitors who are notorious in their own countries, and sending spies to engage in activities that undermine national liberation movements. The American imperialists are frantically intensifying their control and attack on Asian colonies, trying to use Asian human resources to prepare for a new war of aggression,妄想[wàng xiǎng, to attempt vainly; to try to realize the impossible; wishful thinking; delusion] dreaming of launching a sinful war to establish their world hegemony.

　　But the American imperialist conspiracy is destined to fail. It has suffered a shameful defeat in China, and we believe it will not escape the same fate in other parts of Asia. Today, we Chinese youth can face a bright and happy future because we stand firmly with the people in battle and rely on the people's armed forces to overthrow the Chiang Kai-shek reactionaries directly supported by American imperialism. The reason this armed struggle was able to achieve victory is because it was under the strong leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and had the support of the broad patriotic people.

　　We are very excited to see that our Asian brothers, who are temporarily still under imperialist oppression, are resolutely embarking on the road of national liberation struggle. We believe that your just struggle will surely give the imperialist aggressors another painful blow.

　　Naturally, imperialism will not easily give up its privileges. It will inevitably make a frantic deathbed struggle and intensify its suppression of the Asian national liberation movement. Therefore, the future of your struggle will be arduous and the road will be tortuous. But these difficulties are only the darkness before dawn, and the long night will eventually pass. Look at the flames of struggle that are burning in Asia. They are destroying all corrupt forces with the force of a thunderbolt and bringing light to the people who are holding high the banner of liberation.

　　Forward! Dear brothers. Our cause is just, and our strength is invincible.

　　美帝国主义的侵略阴谋在中国已遭可耻的失败在他处逃不了同样命运
    美帝国主义者站在镇压亚洲殖民地人民反抗运动的前列，公开地支持它的伙伴英、法、荷帝国主义者对亚洲殖民地的武装进攻，扶植那些在本国内臭名远扬的卖国者，并派遣间谍从事破坏民族解放运动的活动。美国帝国主义者疯狂地加紧它对亚洲殖民地的控制和进攻，是要利用亚洲的人力资源准备新的侵略战争，妄想发动罪恶的战争来建立自己的世界霸权。
    但美帝国主义的侵略阴谋是注定要失败的，它在中国已遭到可耻的失败，我们相信它在亚洲其他地方也逃不了同样的命运。今天我们中国青年能够面对着一个光明幸福的将来，是因为我们坚定地和人民在一起战斗，依靠人民的武装把美帝国主义直接支持下的蒋介石反动派打倒。这个武装斗争所以能够取得胜利，是因为它在坚强的中国共产党的领导下，有着广大的爱国人民的支持。
    我们很兴奋地看到现在暂时还在帝国主义压迫下的亚洲弟兄，正在坚决地走上民族解放斗争的道路，我们相信你们的正义斗争，一定将会给予帝国主义的侵略者以另一个惨痛的打击。
    自然，帝国主义不会轻易放弃自己的特权，它一定要疯狂地垂死挣扎，一定要加紧对亚洲民族解放运动的镇压，因此，你们斗争的前途将是艰苦的，道路将是曲折的。但这些困难，只是黎明前的黑暗，漫漫的长夜终将会过去。看看那在亚洲燃烧起的斗争火焰吧，它正以雷霆万钧之势摧毁着一切腐朽的力量，把光明带给高举着解放旗帜的人民。
    前进吧！亲爱的弟兄。我们的事业是正义的，我们的力量是不可被战胜的。
