　　Central People's Government Ministry of Agriculture Water Conservancy Promotion Agency
    Lends 8,000 Water Wheels to Help Farmers Increase Production
    [This News Report] In order to help farmers realize this year's cotton and grain production increase plan, the Central People's Government Ministry of Agriculture Water Conservancy Promotion Agency has rushed to produce 8,000 irrigation pipe water wheels to lend to farmers in Hebei. Farmers in the Handan and Dingxian special districts of Hebei had no habit of using pipe water wheels. Cadres in Dingxian responsible for the water wheel lending work carried pipe water wheels to various villages for demonstration and called on farmers to visit. According to many farmers who watched the pipe water wheel demonstration, pipe water wheels are cheaper than the Bagua water wheels, pump more water, are lighter in weight, and can be pulled by a small donkey.
    Because the Central Ministry of Agriculture Water Conservancy Promotion Agency is lending out water wheels earlier this year, farmers in various places who have received the water wheels can prepare for organizing livestock, mutual aid in labor, and repairing and digging wells as soon as possible.
    Currently, the Central Ministry of Agriculture Water Conservancy Promotion Agency is rushing to produce a second batch of 12,000 water wheels, which are planned to be off the assembly line by the end of March this year.

    贷水车八千辆扶助农民增产
    【本报讯】中央人民政府农业部水利推进社为了扶助农民实现今年棉粮增产计划，特赶制浇地管子水车八千辆，贷给河北农民。河北邯郸、定县两专区农民向无使用管子水车习惯。定县作出贷水车工作的干部，携带管子水车到各村示范，召集农民参观。据看了管子水车示范的许多农民反映：管子水车比八卦水车价钱便宜，上水多，重量轻，一头小毛驴便可拉动。
    由于中央农业部水利推进社今年出贷水车时间较早，贷到水车的各地农民，可早日作好组织牲畜、劳动互助和修井挖井等准备工作。
    现中央农业部水利推进社又赶制第二批水车一万二千辆，计划于今年三月底即可出厂。
