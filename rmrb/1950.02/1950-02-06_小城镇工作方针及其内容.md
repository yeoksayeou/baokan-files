　　Working Guidelines for Small Towns and Their Content
    The working guidelines for small towns in the future are, first, to develop handicraft and small-scale machine industries closely related to agriculture in a planned and step-by-step manner, to guide and improve agricultural production. Second, based on production and needs, to actively organize material exchange, gradually centralize scattered agricultural and sideline products, promote their sales, and simultaneously supply rural areas with necessary industrial products, truly making small towns a link connecting urban and rural areas, connecting industry and agricultural production. In terms of specific leadership, Commissioner Sun said that everyone should study the characteristics of their town, understand which are the main, large-scale, and promising aspects of production and exchange, and focus on doing these well before moving on to others; do not spread your efforts evenly, lest you fail to do anything well. Regarding the current work content of small towns, Commissioner Sun proposed: (1) To develop small-scale machine industries and handicraft production such as manufacturing waterwheels and textile machines in a planned and step-by-step manner. (2) To do a good job in the work of supply and marketing cooperatives, control the market, stabilize prices, and reduce intermediate exploitation. (3) To strengthen market management, promote trading with marked prices, standardize weights and measures, promote genuine goods at fair prices, and conduct universal education for merchants, dispelling their concerns and pointing out their business direction. State-owned economic departments should study market conditions, control prices, improve management methods, and facilitate farmers' buying and selling. (4) In terms of taxation, to correct the past shortcomings of assigning tasks by industry, resulting in uneven and excessive burdens, and at the same time, to correct the "light tax" mentality of some merchants who do not consider the overall situation. (5) In leading production, to encourage independent producers to take the road of cooperation, and small industrial workshops to take the road of joint operations, to overcome difficulties such as small capital, poor equipment, low technology, high costs, and narrow sales channels caused by decentralized operations. Encourage industrial and commercial enterprises with no prospects for development to switch to other professions. For urban residents with financial difficulties, encourage everyone to come up with ideas and find solutions to achieve self-reliance through production; overcome their mentality of relying on the government and waiting for relief.

　　小城镇工作方针及其内容
    今后小城镇的工作方针，首先是有计划有步骤地发展与农业有密切关系的手工业和小型机器工业生产，以指导并提高农业生产。其次是根据生产与需要，主动地组织物资交流，逐渐把分散的农业品和副业产品集中起来，推销出去，同时供给农村以必需的工业品，真正使小城镇成为联系城乡、联系工农业生产的纽带。在具体领导上，孙专员说，大家要研究本镇的特点，知道生产和交换上那些是主要的、大量的、有发展前途的，先抓住这些做好，再作别的；不要平均使用力量，以致样样都做不好。关于目前小城镇的工作内容，孙专员提出：（一）有计划有步骤地发展制造水车、纺织机等小型机器工业及手工业生产。（二）作好供销社的工作，掌握市场，稳定物价，减少中间剥削。（三）加强市场管理，提倡挂牌明码交易，统一度量衡，提倡货真价实，并对商人普遍进行教育，打破其顾虑，指出其经营方向。公营经济部门要研究商情，掌握物价，改善经营方法，便利农民买卖。（四）税收方面，要纠正过去按行业分任务、畸重畸轻的缺点，同时要纠正某些商户不从全局出发的“轻税”思想。（五）在领导生产方面，要鼓励独立生产者走合作的道路，小型工业作坊走联营的道路，以克服分散经营的资金小、设备差、技术低、成本高、销路窄等困难。鼓励没有发展前途的工商业转业。对于生活困难的市民，要提倡大家出主意、想办法，实行生产自救；克服其依靠政府、等待救济的思想。
