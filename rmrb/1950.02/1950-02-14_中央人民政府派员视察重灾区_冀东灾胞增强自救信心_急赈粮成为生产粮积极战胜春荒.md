　　The Central People's Government Sends Personnel to Inspect Heavily Afflicted Areas
    Hopei-Jehol Disaster Victims Strengthen Self-Reliance Confidence
    Emergency Relief Grain Becomes Production Grain, Actively Conquer the Spring Famine
    [Report from this newspaper] The Central People's Government specially dispatched Wu Xinyu, Vice Minister of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Government Administration Council, and Li Zheren, Director of the Research Office of the North China Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, to Ninghe, Baodi, Yutian, and Jixian in the Hopei-Jehol area, to express sympathy to the people in the disaster areas and to inspect the work of production and disaster relief. Yang Xiufeng, Chairman of Hebei Province, also personally went to the disaster areas to inspect and guide the work in the disaster areas. At the same time, the Hebei Provincial People's Government has sent a large number of cadres to the disaster areas. Including the original cadres, there are 1,650 people in the four counties, helping to specifically lead the work of production and disaster relief. Each of the heavily afflicted villages has a cadre stationed there, ready to help the masses find ways to overcome the spring famine during the thawing period. The confidence of the people in the disaster areas in production for self-salvation has been greatly enhanced, and the broad masses are urgently demanding production. Production activities such as fishing, weaving, and mat making are underway.
    Currently, there are 20 districts in these four counties that are disaster areas, with a total of 1,097 villages and 516,209 people. Roughly 20 percent can be self-reliant (relying on savings and assistance from others); 50 to 60 percent can also overcome the disaster through production for self-salvation after being supported; 10 to 20 percent need to be given relief separately. The most difficult are the elderly, weak, widowed, and lonely, who have neither sources of production nor productive capacity, and are in urgent need of relief. This group accounts for about 10 percent of the general disaster victims.
    More than 6 million jin of emergency relief grain and more than 6 million jin of wheat seed grain allocated by the Central People's Government, as well as relief grain allocated by Hebei Province and grain donated by all sectors of Hebei Province, have mostly been transported to the disaster areas; some places have already distributed it to each household. As of mid-February, Jixian County had transported more than 1.54 million jin of grain to the disaster areas; 80,000 jin had been distributed to households in need of relief before the 7th. Ninghe and Baodi also have 300,000 to 500,000 jin each transported to base grain stations. Yutian County has transported 950,000 jin. The completion of the grain transportation task has given the disaster victims more favorable conditions for production and self-salvation. Making good use of this relief grain as production grain can ensure that people will not starve to death during the "winding period" (i.e., the thawing period).

　　中央人民政府派员视察重灾区
    冀东灾胞增强自救信心
    急赈粮成为生产粮积极战胜春荒
    【本报讯】中央人民政府特派政务院内务部副部长武新宇，中共中央华北局特派研究室主任李哲人赴冀东宁河、宝坻、玉田、蓟县，慰问灾区人民并检查生产救灾工作。河北省杨秀峰主席亦亲至灾区视察指导灾区工作。同时，河北省人民政府已派大批干部前往灾区，连原有干部在内，四县即有一千六百五十人，帮助具体领导生产救灾工作。重灾村每村都驻有一个干部，准备在解冰期帮助群众想办法克服春荒。灾区人民生产自救的信心大为增强，广大群众迫切要求生产。捕鱼、纺织、编席等生产正在开展。
    目前这四县中有二十个区是灾区，共有一千零九十七个村，五十一万六千二百零九人。大体上有百分之二十可以自力更生（依靠积蓄和别人的接济）；百分之五十到百分之六十经扶持后，亦可生产自救渡过灾荒；百分之十到百分之二十需分别予以救济。最困难者为老弱鳏寡孤独，既无生产来源又无生产能力，迫待急赈，这部分人数占一般灾民人数的百分之十左右。
    中央人民政府所拨的六百余万斤急赈粮、六百余万斤麦种粮及河北省所拨的救济粮、河北省各界的捐助粮，已大部运往灾区；有的地方已发到各户。至二月中旬，蓟县已运达灾区粮一百五十四万余斤；七号前即已发下八万斤到待救济的各户。宁河、宝坻亦各有三十万至五十万斤运到基点粮站。玉田县已运到九十五万斤。运粮任务的完成，给了灾民以更有利的生产自救的条件。好好利用这救济粮作生产粮，可保证在缠期（即解冻期）不饿死人。
