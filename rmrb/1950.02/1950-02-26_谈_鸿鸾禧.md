　　Talking About "Hongluan Xi"
　　Ai Qing
　　"Hongluan Xi," also known as "Beating the Ungrateful Lover," is a play with a strong sense of everyday life, vivid characters, and lively language among the old dramas.

　　The story of this play is as follows: A poor scholar named Mo Ji, driven by hunger and cold, lay stiffly in front of the door of Jin Song, the head of the beggars, on the verge of death. He was seen by Jin Song's daughter, Yu Nu, who took pity on him, brought him home, and gave him soybean milk to drink. Jin Song had no son, so he kept Mo Ji and betrothed Yu Nu to him. After their marriage, Yu Nu encouraged Mo Ji to continue his studies diligently and accompanied him to the capital to take the imperial examination. Their livelihood along the way was sustained by Jin Song begging for food. Mo Ji passed the examination and became a Jinshi (a successful candidate in the highest imperial exams), his heart changed. He thought about his impending rise to prominence, forgetting his humble origins, and looked down on Jin Song, the head of the beggars, and his daughter. Soon, Mo Ji was appointed as the magistrate of Dehua County in Jiangxi. On the way to his post by boat, he took advantage of Jin Song's drunkenness and tricked Yu Nu into going out of the cabin to enjoy the moon. He repaid kindness with hatred, pushing Yu Nu into the river and driving Jin Song off the boat. Later, Yu Nu was rescued by Lin Run, the provincial inspector of Jiangxi, and adopted as his goddaughter. Mo Ji was Lin Run's subordinate. After Lin Run learned about Yu Nu's experience, in order to reunite Yu Nu and Mo Ji, he pretended that Yu Nu was his own daughter and entrusted Jin Yong, the magistrate of Nanchang County, to act as a matchmaker, betrothing Yu Nu to Mo Ji. Mo Ji did not know the truth and was naturally very happy. On the wedding night, Yu Nu asked the maid to prepare sticks, hid in the new room, and waited for Mo Ji to arrive, then beat him for a while. Mo Ji admitted his mistake, and Yu Nu and Mo Ji reconciled.

　　This story is taken from the thirty-second chapter of "Stories Old and New" titled "Jin Yu Nu Beats the Ungrateful Lover." The plot of the play is largely the same as the novel, with only slight modifications in a few places. In the novel, Yu Nu's father is called Jin Laoda, and the ungrateful lover is called Mo Xu, who is a registrar of the Wuwei Army; the official who rescued Yu Nu was Xu Dehou, a transport commissioner in Huaixi. The place where she was pushed into the river in the novel is the Caishi River from Lin'an to the Wuwei Army, while in the play it is the river from Lin'an to Dehua County. The novel describes Mo Ji himself taking a liking to Yu Nu and asking a neighbor to go to the Jin family to propose marriage.

　　But the play is much more vivid than the novel. The entire play is divided into ten scenes, with the pushing into the river as the boundary, forming two parts. The first six scenes, except for the first scene of the Tianxi Star descending to arrange the marriage and the second scene of jumping the Kui Xing as a superfluous interlude, the rest are well written, the plot develops naturally, and the characters' personalities also change with the changes in the plot.

　　Mo Ji is a scholar who is ungrateful for fame and fortune. He speaks in a pedantic manner and is very hypocritical. When Jin Song wanted to betroth Yu Nu to him, a contradiction arose in his mind, but he reluctantly agreed for the sake of immediate benefits—

　　Mo Ji (aside) Oh, wait a minute! Thinking that Jin Yu Nu is the daughter of a beggar, how can I be matched with her? Well! In this helpless situation, I will agree to him for now, and make plans after I pass the examination...

　　Once he passed the Jinshi examination, he immediately revealed his true colors to the Jin family, putting on airs:

　　Jin Song: Master-son-in-law, you passed! The messenger is here to announce the good news!

　　Mo Ji: What? I passed! Ah ha ha ha! (Spits out rice)

　　Mo Ji: Call him in.

　　Jin Song: Messenger, the master wants you to come in.

　　Messenger: The messenger kowtows to the master.

　　Mo Ji: Enough, do you have the report?

　　Messenger: Yes.

　　Mo Ji: Present it.

　　Messenger: Yes.

　　At this time, Mo Ji took the report, with Jin Song and Yu Nu standing on either side of him, their heads stretched out to look at the report. Mo Ji, full of pride, knowing that Jin Song and Yu Nu are illiterate, deliberately handed the report to them—

　　Mo Ji: Father-in-law, please take a look.

　　Jin Song: Son-in-law, please take a look.

　　Mo Ji: Wife, please take a look.

　　Yu Nu: Husband, please take a look.

　　Mo Ji: Then everyone will watch together (reads)

　　A triumphant report to your esteemed residence, Mo Ji, Mo the Great Master, has been awarded the eighth position in the Jia Chen imperial examination. Ha, ha, ha!

　　This is a laugh of elation.

　　Jin Song did not know Mo Ji's psychology, of course, he was also very happy. He thought that his son-in-law had passed the Jinshi examination and would no longer have to be a beggar in the future—

　　Jin Song: (Laughing) Ha, ha, ha! Son-in-law passed! Become an official, I am the old master! Haha!

　　But Mo Ji did not forget Jin Song's identity. He saw that Jin Song was still the head of the beggars. Seeing Jin Song so happy, he said with a straight face:

　　Mo Ji: Well, although I passed, everyone must have some rules from now on.

　　Hearing these words from Mo Ji, Yu Nu painfully realized that Mo Ji was contemptuous of her father and herself, and felt very sad—

　　Yu Nu: (Hinting at Jin Song to go outside to speak)

　　Dad! Did you hear that: "Although I passed, everyone must have some rules from now on." Dad, you are so old, can I still let you suffer with my daughter? Dad, please bear with it.

　　(Jin Song weeps. Yu Nu wipes away tears.)

　　The messenger came a second time to announce that Mo Ji had been appointed as the magistrate of Dehua County, his face was even colder.

　　Messenger: The messenger kowtows to the master.

　　Mo Ji: Enough, do you have the report?

　　Messenger: Yes.

　　Mo Ji: Present it.

　　(Jin Song wanted to see the report, Mo Ji glared at him, Yu Nu also wanted to see it, but Mo Ji treated her with a cold face.)

　　Mo Ji: Hmph! (Reads) A report to your esteemed residence, Mo Ji, Mo the Great Master, has been officially appointed as the magistrate of Dehua County. Post the report outside the door!

　　Jin Song: Yes! (Slaps the report unwillingly.)

　　Mo Ji's psychology continued to develop. On the way to his post by boat, he was already very disgusted with the Jin family and even used Jin Song as a servant—

　　(Two boatmen come up)

　　(Scene music. Four guards and clerks lead Mo Ji, Jin Yu Nu, and Jin Song up. Jin Yu Nu wanted to get on the boat first, but was stopped by Mo Ji. Jin Yu Nu was so angry that she almost jumped into the river, crying with Jin Song. After getting on the boat, the guards and clerks go down first.)

　　Mo Ji: Order to set sail!

　　Boatman: Yes! Reporting to the master: the wind is strong and the waves are high, it is inconvenient to sail.

　　Mo Ji: Then tow the boat here.

　　Boatman: Yes.

　　Mo Ji: Jin'er! Jin'er!

　　Jin Song: Who are you calling?

　　(Jin Yu Nu hints at Jin Song)

　　Jin Song: Yes!

　　Mo Ji: Pour wine.

　　Jin Song: Yes!

　　Jin Song served him wine. After he finished eating, Mo Ji said:

　　Jin'er, take away the wine and food, and eat it on the bow of the boat!

　　This was an insult to Jin Song. Jin Song was very sad. While drinking, he muttered and cursed Mo Ji—

　　Jin Song: (Exiting the cabin. Aside) Good boy, you heartless bastard, if my daughter and I hadn't saved you when you were freezing and starving at my door, how would you be alive! This time you are going to take office, if you treat me well, that's fine, but if you mistreat me, I'll make you spit out the soybean milk! It's infuriating, um...

　　These words were heard by Mo Ji, which prompted his determination to frame Jin Yu Nu, and finally tricked Yu Nu out of the cabin and pushed her into the river. In this way, the change in Mo Ji's thoughts caused by the change in his status is naturally reflected, and these changes are expressed through concrete actions - looking at the triumphant report, blocking the way when getting on the boat, asking Jin Song to pour wine... etc. - but not through the character's verbal confession or narration. This is what we usually call the image-based technique.

　　In contrast to Mo Ji's ingratitude is the kindness and loyalty of the Jin family. Although Jin Song was the head of the beggars, reducing the audience's sympathy for him, they were kind-hearted people. From the beginning, they felt pity for Mo Ji's situation and always treated Mo Ji well. On the way to Beijing to take the exam, Jin Song and Yu Nu even preferred to starve themselves to let Mo Ji eat his fill—

　　Jin Song: (Sings Xipi Yaoban) I begged for leftovers and cold rice on the long street, and went home to provide my son-in-law with a full meal.

　　Yu Nu: Dad, you're back?

　　Jin Song: I'm back.

　　Yu Nu: Your son-in-law is hungry.

　　Jin Song: I begged for half a bowl of cold rice today, son-in-law, you can eat it first.

　　Mo Ji: Father-in-law, please eat.

　　Jin Song: I'm not hungry at all, you eat it, you eat it to write articles, it's useless for me to eat it.

　　Mo Ji: Wife, please come and eat!

　　Yu Nu: I'm not hungry yet.

　　Later, when Mo Ji passed the examination and was taken to his post, the clerks asked Jin Song to change into new clothes and let Jin Song choose himself. Jin Song said: "It's too good, I'm not used to wearing it, let me see for myself."

　　So he put on a servant's clothes.

　　Even when his beloved daughter was pushed into the river by Mo Ji and he lost his livelihood, when Mo Ji wanted to send him away with twenty taels of silver, he still thought Mo Ji would pity him and begged Mo Ji bitterly—

　　Jin Song: I said, master-son-in-law, I only have one daughter, and now she is dead again, I am alone and helpless, where can I go? I still beg master-son-in-law to take me to my post, give me a little bit of leftover tea and cold rice to eat. Don't treat me as your father-in-law, just treat me as your family member, please take me with you.

　　Mo Ji: There are many rules in the yamen, how would you understand them?

　　Jin Song: Although there are many rules in the yamen, I can learn one thing a day, and I can learn three hundred and sixty things a year. Besides, I have also been the head of the beggars, and I also understand a little bit of rules. This time, don't treat me as a person, just treat me as a dog, and you can take care of me in my old age.

　　Although this seems a bit weak, it further reflects Mo Ji's character. Finally, Mo Ji even said "Too verbose!" Jin Song suddenly woke up, he really couldn't bear it anymore, now he was completely enraged—

　　Jin Song: Hmph! I knew you were a truly heartless little Mo Ji! Don't you remember that without my daughter and I saving you, where would you be today? I begged you so bitterly, but you have no heart at all. You! I don't want to wear your clothes and hat either (throws clothes and hat on the ground). I knew this would happen, I still have a torn hat.

　　Mo Ji: Boatman, drive him down.

　　Jin Song: You don't need to drive me, I can walk myself. (Jumps ashore.)

　　Mo Ji! Mo Ji! I call you a wolf-hearted thief! If heaven has retribution, I'll make you spit out the soybean milk again. There are stones here, I'll smash you a few times. (Throws stones at the boat)

　　This is a very strong contrast: on one side is such hypocrisy, ingratitude, coldness, and ruthlessness; on the other side is kindness, gentleness, but being deceived, leading to the destruction of the family.

　　This play not only has a strong contrast in the characters' personalities, but also has a strong contrast in the characters' language. The following dialogues vividly depict the different languages ​​of two different characters—

　　Mo Ji: So it's an old man.

　　Jin Song: The new debt has not been paid, what is the old debt again.

　　Mo Ji: (Sings Xipi Yaoban) After eating the soybean milk, my spirits are high, such good deeds are rare in the world, I step forward to pay my respects and thank you for saving me.

　　Jin Song: I'll beat you!

　　Jin Yu Nu: Dad! Why are you hitting him?

　　Jin Song: Girl, look, he is full, he is drunk, he doesn't even say thank you, but he calls me uncle, don't you think this person is hateful?

　　Yu Nu: Dad! Don't be angry, let me ask him. Hey, I said, why are you being unreasonable? I asked you to eat and drink your fill, you didn't even say thank you, why did you call my dad uncle?

　　Mo Ji: Oh, miss, the old man he heard wrong. I said it was the "saving" of being saved, not calling him uncle. Jin Song... What did you say your surname was just now? I didn't hear clearly, say it again.

　　Mo Ji: My name is Mo Ji, a scholar in this city.

　　Jin Song: His name is Mo Ji, a scholar in this city, oh... scare! I asked you, you also ask me.

　　Mo Ji: Oh! If the old man hadn't mentioned it, the old man would have been delayed.

　　Jin Song: What are you talking about?

　　Mo Ji: May I ask, old man: What is your respected name?

　　Jin Song: My name is Jin, single name is Song.

　　Mo Ji: Oh! Old man Jin Song, Jin is the Jin of gold and jade filling the hall, and Song is the Song of pine and cypress evergreen, what an elegant name. Ah, old man Jin, there was a little girl just now, who is she?

　　Jin Song: It's my daughter.

　　Mo Ji: What? Is she a gold piece?

　　Jin Song: Little girl.

　　The author adopts a satirical attitude towards Mo Ji. From the above dialogues, he draws a sour and ugly state of an old intellectual. In other places, he also often mocks this character. For example, Mo Ji himself once said: "Talking big is my forte," Mo Ji accidentally broke a bowl when he was happy after eating soybean milk, Jin Song said to his daughter: "It's fortunate that he is a scholar, he broke my bowl, if he were a Juren (a successful candidate in the provincial imperial exams), he would smash the pot in my house!" On the way to Beijing to take the exam, Jin Song begged for a bowl of rice for Mo Ji to eat, Mo Ji pretended to be polite, Jin Song said: "You eat it to write articles, it's useless for me to eat it." Mo Ji passed the examination, when he looked at the triumphant report and leaned back happily, his hand accidentally hit Jin Song's face, Jin Song said: "You passed, I'm swollen here!"

　　All of these are enough to show that the play "Hongluan Xi" has a certain literary value. These strengths are precisely what our comrades who write—especially comrades who write scripts—should carefully study.

　　The last four scenes, the seventh scene is Lin Run saving Yu Nu, the eighth scene is Lin Run sending someone to find Jin Song, the ninth scene is Lin Run asking the Nanchang County official Jin Yong to be the matchmaker to betroth Yu Nu to Mo Ji, and the tenth scene is the reunion after beating the ungrateful lover.

　　The author's intention is to use the second half to ease or cover up the social antagonism between the Jin family and Mo Ji, so that this play becomes a legal work. Therefore, a work that was originally critical was reduced to a compromising work used to resolve disputes. As with many old plays, the author chose a county magistrate, a not very important role in the ruling class, as the object of criticism, and conversely chose a provincial inspector, who has a relatively high status in the ruling class, as the object of praise. It is precisely because of this reason that the second half of this play contains poison. An event that originally reflected the antagonism between two classes, at least a case of wrongful death, was transformed into a family matter through the efforts of the ruling class, dissolved by the love of children. Here, Lin Run became the embodiment of justice. Jin Yu Nu and her father's sticks of revenge could only hit Mo Ji with Lin Run's approval and empowerment. And such a few beatings can most paralyze the masses of the people, and dispel all the resentment and antagonistic emotions in their hearts.

　　In the second half, even the characters were altered. Lin Run sent someone to find Jin Song, and Jin Song became proud—

　　Jin Song: Really? Heaven really has eyes, did you bring the clothes?

　　Servant: I brought them.

　　Jin Song: Help me put them on (puts on clothes), this hat doesn't need to be kept now. You lead the way in front, idlers step aside, the member is coming!

　　This Jin Song is completely different from the Jin Song who said earlier, "It's too good, I'm not used to wearing it," and then chose a servant's clothes to wear.

　　I remember that when the Yan'an Pingju Research Institute performed it, the second half was not performed, and the title of the play was changed to "Pushing into the River". Regardless of whether this modification is completely appropriate, but if the second half is to be performed, it needs to be modified to make it a better script both artistically and ideologically. Of course, there are also some places in the first half that need to be modified.

### 谈“鸿鸾禧”

　　谈“鸿鸾禧”
　　艾青
    “鸿鸾禧”也叫“棒打薄情郎”，是旧剧里面比较生活气息很浓，人物性格鲜明，语言生动的一个剧本。
    这个剧本的故事是这样的：一个叫莫稽的穷秀才，为饥寒所迫，僵卧在乞丐头金松家的门前，快要死了，被金松的女儿玉奴看见，玉奴可怜他，把他救到家里，给他豆汁浆喝。金松没有儿子，就把莫稽留下，并把玉奴许配给他。结婚后，玉奴勉励莫稽继续发奋用功，又陪同莫稽到京里投考，一路上的生活都由金松讨饭来维持。莫稽考中了进士，他的心变了。他想到自己将要显贵，贵而忘贱，就瞧不起作为乞丐头的金松和他的女儿了。不久莫稽被任命为江西德化县知事，在坐船上任的路上，趁金松酒醉未醒，骗玉奴到舱外赏月，恩将仇报，把玉奴推入江心，并把金松撵下船去。后来玉奴被江西巡按林润所救，收作义女。而莫稽是林润的属下。林润知道了玉奴的遭遇之后，为了使玉奴和莫稽能团圆，就假装玉奴是自己的亲生女，托南昌县知事金永为媒，把玉奴许配给莫稽。莫稽不知道底细，当然很高兴。结婚的晚上，玉奴叫丫环预备了棍棒，躲在新房里，等莫稽来了，就打了一阵。莫稽承认了错误，玉奴与莫稽重归于好。
    这故事采自“今古奇观”第三十二回“金玉奴棒打薄情郎”。剧本和小说的情节大体相同，只是很少的地方稍有改动。在小说里，玉奴的父亲叫金老大，薄情郎叫莫楈，是无为军司户；救起玉奴的是淮西转运使官员许德厚。推江的地方在小说里是临安到无为军的采石江边，在剧本里是临安到德化县的江上。小说里写的是莫稽自己看上了玉奴后请邻翁到金家去求亲的。
    但剧本写得比小说生动多了。全剧分十场，以推江为界，成为两个部分，前面是六场，后面是四场。前面六场除第一场开场的天喜星下凡撮合姻缘和第二场跳魁星过场是多余的之外，其余都写得很好，情节发展很自然，人物的性格也随着情节的变化而变化。
    莫稽是一个为功名利禄而忘恩负义的读书人，说起话来咬文嚼字，待人很虚伪。当金松要把玉奴许配给他的时候，他的心里就产生了矛盾，但却为眼前的利益勉强答应了———
　　莫稽    （背工）哎呀且住！想那金玉奴乃是丐头之女，岂能与她配合？也罢！在此无可奈何之中，暂且答应了他，日后得中再作道理……
    等他一考中了进士，马上就对金氏父女显露了原形，摆起架子来了：
　　金松    姑老爷你中啦！现有报录的来啦！
　　莫稽    怎么我中了！啊哈哈哈哈！（将饭喷出介）
　　莫稽    唤他进来。
　　金松    报录的，老爷唤你进去。
　　报子    报录的与老爷叩头。
　　莫稽    罢了，可有报单？
　　报子    有。
　　莫稽    呈上来。
　　报子    是。
    这时莫稽拿了报单，在他的背后两边站着金松和玉奴，他们的头伸长到莫稽头边去看报单，莫稽充满得意的样子，知道金松和玉奴都不识字，却故意把报单递给他们——
　　莫稽    岳父大人请看，
　　金松    姑爷请看，
　　莫稽    娘子请看，
　　玉奴    官人请看，
　　莫稽    如此大家一同观看，（念介）
　　捷报贵府第莫稽莫大老爷得中甲辰科第八名进士。哈，哈，哈！
    这是一种得意忘形的笑声。
    金松不知道莫稽的心理，当然也很高兴，他以为女婿考了进士，以后可以不再做乞丐了——
　　金松    （笑介）哈、哈、哈！姑爷中了！做啦官，我就是老太爷啦！哈哈！
    但是莫稽没有忘掉金松的身份，他看金松还是一个乞丐头，金松这样高兴，他就板着脸说：
　　莫稽    唔，中虽中了，以后大家要拿些规矩出来。
    听到了莫稽这几句话，玉奴很痛苦的发觉莫稽对她父亲和自己都是轻蔑的，心里很难过——
　　玉奴    （暗示金松走向门外说话介）
　　爹呀！你听见没有：“中虽中啦，以后要拿些规矩出来。”爹呀，你这么大的年纪，还能叫你跟女儿受苦吗？爹，你忍着点儿罢。
    （金松泣介。玉奴自揩眼泪介。）
    报子第二次来报知莫稽被任用为德化县县官的时候，这副面孔更冷酷了。
　　报子    报录的与老爷叩头。
　　莫稽    罢了，可有报单？
　　报子    有。
　　莫稽    呈上来。
    （金松想看报单，莫稽向他瞪眼，玉奴想看，也被莫稽用冷面孔对待。）
　　莫稽    哼！（念）报到贵府第莫稽莫大老爷实授德化县正堂。将报单贴在门外！
　　金松    喳！（不情不愿的将报单一拍介。）
    莫稽的这种心理继续发展，在坐船上任的路上，对金氏父女已很嫌恶，甚至把金松当做用人来使唤了——
    （二船夫上）
    （场面吹打。四侍卫书吏引莫稽金玉奴金松上。金玉奴欲先上船，被莫稽拦住介。金玉奴气得几欲跳河，与金松哭作一团介。上船后，侍卫及书吏先下。）
　　莫稽    吩咐开船！
　　船夫    喳！回禀老爷：风狂浪大，不便行舟。
　　莫稽    就在此处挽船。
　　船夫    是。
　　莫稽    金儿！金儿！
　　金松    叫谁吓？
    （金玉奴暗示金松介）
　　金松    有！
　　莫稽    斟酒。
　　金松    喳！
    金松在旁边侍候他喝酒，等自己吃完了之后，莫稽说：
    金儿，将酒席撤去，上船头去用吧！
    这对金松是污辱。金松很伤心，一边喝酒，一边就自言自语地骂起莫稽来了——
　　金松    （出舱介。背工）好小子，我把你黑心王八蛋，当初你冻饿在我家门首，不是我女儿救你，那有你活命！此番上任，你待我好，还则罢了，若有错待，非叫你把豆汁儿给我吐出来！气死我啦，唔………
    这些话被莫稽听到了，促成了他陷害金玉奴的决心，终于把玉奴骗到舱外，推入江心，这样地，把莫稽这个人物因地位的变化而引起的思想的变化，很自然地反映出来，而这些变化是通过具体的行动--看捷报、上船的时候拦路，要金松斟酒……等等--表现出来，却不是通过角色的口头的表白叙述出来的。这也就是我们通常所说的形象化的手法。
    和莫稽的忘恩负义相对照的，是金氏父女的善良忠厚。金松虽然是个乞丐头，减少了观众对他的同情，但他们是好心肠的人，从一开始，他们就对莫稽的境遇怀着怜悯，一直对莫稽很好，在莫稽上京投考的路上，金松和玉奴甚至宁可自己挨饿，却让莫稽吃饱——
　　金松    （唱西皮摇板）在长街讨来了残肴冷饭，回家去供女婿一顿饱餐。
　　玉奴    爹爹，你回来啦？
　　金松    我回来啦。
　　玉奴    你女婿肚子饿啦。
　　金松    我今天讨啦半碗冷饭，女婿你先用啦罢。
　　莫稽    岳父大人请用。
　　金松    我一点儿不饿，你吃罢，你吃了做文章，我吃了没有用。
　　莫稽    娘子请来用饭！
　　玉奴    我呀！还不饿呐。
    后来莫稽考中了，被接上任时，书吏要金松换新衣，让金松自己选择，金松说：“太好啦穿不惯，让我自己看。”
    于是他穿上了一身用人的衣服。
    甚至到他最心爱的女儿被莫稽推入江心，他失去了生活的凭依了，莫稽想用二十两纹银打发他走时，他还以为莫稽会可怜他，向莫稽苦苦哀求——
　　金松    我说姑老爷，我就是一个女儿，如今她又死啦，我是无依无靠，孤苦伶仃一个人，叫我到哪里去？还是求求姑老爷。带我上任，有什么吃剩的残茶冷饭，给我吃一点儿。你也别当我是丈人，只当我是你的家人，你带我去罢。
　　莫稽    衙门规矩甚多，你哪里懂得？
　　金松    衙门规矩虽多，我一天学一样，一年也能学三百六十样啦。再说我也干过丐头，亦懂点儿规矩。此番前去，你别当我是个人，只当我是条狗，你养老了我罢。
    这虽然显得有些软弱，却也更反映了莫稽的性格。最后，莫稽竟说了“太也噜苏了！”金松才恍然觉悟过来，他实在忍无可忍，现在完全激怒了——
　　金松    哼哼！我把你真没有良心的小莫稽啊！你不想当初没有我父女将你救活，你哪有今天？我这样苦苦的求你，你竟毫无心肝。你！你的衣帽我也不要穿，（脱衣帽掷地介。）我早知有今天，一顶破帽还留着呢。
　　莫稽    船家哄了下去。
　　金松    不用你哄，我自己会走。（跳上岸介。）
    莫稽！莫稽！我把你这狼心贼！老天若有报应，我再叫你把豆汁吐出来。这儿有石块，砸你几下。（向船掷石介）
    这是十分强烈的对照：一面是那样的虚伪、忘恩负义、冷酷无情；一面是善良、温厚却被欺骗，弄得家破人亡。
    这个剧本，不但在人物的性格上有强烈的对照，同时也在人物的语言上有强烈的对照，下面的几段对话，十分生动地描写了两种不同的人物的不同的语言——
　　莫稽    原来是位老丈。
　　金松    新账没有还，什么又是老账。
　　莫稽    （唱西皮摇板）吃完了豆汁浆精神抖擞，似这等阴功事世间少有，走向前施一礼多蒙搭救。
　　金松    我揍你！
　　金玉奴  爹！为什么你打他？
　　金松    丫头你看，他吃饱啦，喝足啦，连个谢字都没有，反而叫我大舅，你看这人可恶不可恶？
　　玉奴    爹！你别生气，我来问问他。嗨，我说你怎么不讲理？请你吃饱啦，喝足啦，连个谢字都没有，为什么反而叫我爹大舅子？
　　莫稽    哎呀，小姐，老丈么他听错了。我说的是搭救之救，不是叫他大舅。金松……方才你说姓什么？我没有听清楚，你再说一遍。
　　莫稽    小生姓莫名稽，乃是本城一个秀才。
　　金松    姓莫名稽，乃是本城一个秀才，哦……唬！我问了你，你也问问我。
　　莫稽    啊呀呀！不是老丈提起，把老丈耽误了。
　　金松    这是什么话？
　　莫稽    请问老丈：尊姓大名？
　　金松    老汉姓金单名一个松字。
　　莫稽    哦！金松老丈，金乃金玉满堂之金，松乃松柏长青之松，好一个高雅的名字。啊，金老丈方才有位小姑娘，她是什么人？
　　金松    乃是小女。
　　莫稽    什么？是千金？
　　金松    小丫头。
    作者对莫稽是采取讽刺的态度的，从上面这些对话，画出了一个旧文人的酸溜溜的丑态，在别的地方，也常常嘲笑这个人物，例如莫稽自己曾说：“说大话乃是我的拿手，”莫稽吃了豆汁浆高兴的时候失手打了碗，金松对女儿说：“亏了他是个秀才，碎了我的碗，他要是举人，把我家的锅也砸啦！”在赴京投考的路上，金松讨了一碗饭给莫稽吃，莫稽假装客气，金松说：“你吃了做文章，我吃了没有用。”，莫稽考中了，看了捷报高兴得向后仰时，他的手无意的打到了金松的脸上，金松说：“你中啦，我这儿肿啦！”
    所有这些，都足以说明《鸿鸾禧》这个剧本，是有它的一定的文学价值的，它的这些长处，也正是我们写作的同志--尤其是写剧本的同志应该细心研究的地方。
    后半部分四场，第七场是林润救玉奴，第八场是林润派人找到金松，第九场是林润诗南昌县官金永为媒把玉奴许配给莫稽，第十场是棒打薄情郎之后的团圆。
    作者的用意是想用后半部来缓和或掩盖金氏父女与莫稽之间的社会性的对立关系，使这个剧本成为合法的作品，因此，把一个原来带有批判性的作品，降低到用来和解纠纷的妥协性的作品了。也和许多旧剧里所常见的一样，作者选择了一个在统治阶级里面不十分重要的角色县长，作为批评的对象，而反过来选择了一个在统治阶级里面地位比较高的巡按，作为歌颂的对象，也正因为这个缘故，这个剧本的后半部是含有毒素的。原来反映了两个阶级对立的一个事件，至少也是一场谋害人命的冤仇案件，由于统治阶级内部的努力，转化为家庭私事，通过儿女之情来消融掉。这里，林润成了正义的化身。金玉奴和她父亲的报复的棍棒之能打在莫稽的身上，是由林润批准而且赋与权力的。而这样的几下棒打，却最能麻痹人民群众，把满心的愤懑和对立的情绪都给打得烟消云散了。
    在后半部，连人物也涂改了，林润派人找到了金松，金松竟也骄傲起来了——
　　金松    真得吗？老天真有眼睛，你衣服带来没有？
　　家院    带来了。
　　金松    与我穿上（穿衣介），这顶帽子现在不必再留了。你在头里带路，闲人走开，员外来了！
    这个金松就和前面他所说的“太好了穿不惯，让我自己看。”然后选择了一身用人穿的衣服的金松判若两人了。
    记得延安平剧研究院演出时，后半部是不演的，剧名改为“推江”，不管这样修改是否完全恰当，但假如后半部也要演出，是需要加以修改的，使它成为艺术上思想上都较好的剧本，自然，前半部中也有一些需要修改的地方。
