Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, February 16th: The announcement of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance, and Mutual Assistance has transformed Lunar New Year's Eve in Shenyang, the capital of Northeast China, into a grand festival of significant historical importance. This morning, five to six hundred thousand citizens from various districts of Shenyang held celebratory parades in their respective areas. At 2:30 PM, the Northeast People's Government convened a grand meeting to celebrate the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance, and Mutual Assistance. Over 1,800 representatives from all walks of life attended the celebration, including over 300 Soviet experts and personnel invited to work in Northeast China. The presidium of the meeting also included Sabalovskiy, the Soviet Consul in Shenyang, and Nikonov, the representative of the Soviet experts. The meeting was held in an atmosphere overflowing with Sino-Soviet friendship. Gao Gang, Chairman of the Northeast People's Government, Mr. Gao Chongmin, representative of the China Democratic League's Northeast Region, and representatives from all sectors delivered speeches at the meeting, unanimously expressing their support for the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance, and Mutual Assistance and other agreements. They explained the great significance of these treaties and agreements for China's national defense and economic construction, especially for the economic construction of Northeast China. At 4:30 PM, the Northeast People's Government held a grand cocktail party. More than 400 people attended, including Soviet diplomatic personnel, technical experts, and representatives from all walks of life. A celebratory evening party was held after the cocktail party at 6 PM. At the same time, the literary and art circles of Shenyang also held a celebration attended by more than 1,000 people. Today's *Northeast Daily* also published an editorial entitled "A Great Happy Event for the Chinese People," emphasizing that the signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance, and Mutual Assistance has brought about the miserable bankruptcy of Acheson and other American imperialists' various rumors and slanders against the Soviet Union and Northeast China. The editorial also called on the people of Northeast China to work hard to restore and develop production with the assistance of our great Soviet friends, and to strengthen the profound brotherly friendship between the people of China and the Soviet Union.
