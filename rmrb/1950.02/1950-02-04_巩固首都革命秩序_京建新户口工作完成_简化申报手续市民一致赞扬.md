　　Consolidating the Revolutionary Order of the Capital
    Completion of Beijing's New Household Registration Work
    Simplified Application Procedures Unanimously Praised by Citizens
    [Beijing News] The work of establishing a new household registration system and replacing household registration slips with household registration booklets for all citizens in Beijing has been fully completed. In order to determine the domicile of citizens and collect household registration statistics as a basis for the construction of the people's capital, the Municipal People's Government promulgated in November of last year the "Beijing Municipality Citizen Household Registration Regulations" and the "Provisional Penalties for Violations of the Beijing Municipality Household Registration Regulations," abolishing the fifteen types of application forms and cumbersome procedures of the Kuomintang reactionary government before liberation, and simplifying the household registration procedures. It was also decided that the Municipal Public Security Bureau would replace the household registration slips of all citizens with household registration booklets. Before replacing the household registration booklets, the Municipal Public Security Bureau, starting from November 18th, first launched a general publicity campaign throughout the city in cooperation with the Suburban Work Committee of the Municipal Government, the Cultural Committee of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, and the Municipal Public Security Corps; then, starting from November 24th, it formed teams based on each police station to accurately fill out forms door-to-door, and all work was completed by December 23rd. According to the correct statistics after this replacement of household registration booklets, there are a total of 441,799 households and 2,030,986 people in Beijing. The completion of this work not only helps the construction of the people's capital in municipal administration, industry, culture and education, but also greatly helps public security work. In the establishment of the new household registration system, in addition to 99,829 citizens correcting household registrations that were falsely reported or underreported before liberation due to fear of the Kuomintang's conscription and taxation, 1,811 unregistered special agents and stray soldiers were also discovered, as well as 12,676 elements who endangered public security by privately hiding weapons, concealing enemy property, smoking and selling drugs, and spreading rumors and sabotage. In the work of replacing household registration booklets, cadres and people's police worked conscientiously and had a kind attitude, which not only thoroughly improved police-people relations, but also won unanimous praise from the citizens.

　　巩固首都革命秩序
    京建新户口工作完成
    简化申报手续市民一致赞扬
    【北京讯】京市建立新户口制度、更换全市市民户口单为户口簿工作，业已全部完成。市人民政府为确定市民属籍，并搜集户口统计资料为建设人民首都的依据，于去年十一月公布了“北京市市民声报户口规则”及“违反市户口声报规则暂行罚则”，废除解放前国民党反动政府的十五种申请书及繁琐手续，简化了声报户口手续；并决定由市公安局更换全市市民户口单为户口簿。市公安局在更换户口簿前于十一月十八日起，首先配合市政府郊区工作委员会、中共北京市委文委会、市公安总队等在全市展开普遍宣传；继于十一月二十四日起，以各派出所为单位，分别组成小组，挨门挨户确实填写，至十二月二十三日全部工作业已完成。据此次更换户口簿后的正确统计，京市共有市民四十四万一千七百九十九户，二百零三万零九百八十六人。这一工作的完成不但有助于人民首都的市政、工业、文教等各方面的建设工作，而且对治安工作帮助也很大。在建立新户口制度中，除有市民九万九千八百二十九人更正了解放前怕国民党抓兵、征税而假报和漏报的户口外，并发现未登记的特务分子和流散军人一千八百一十一名及私藏武器、隐匿敌产、吸售毒品、造谣破坏等危害治安分子一万二千六百七十六名。在更换户口簿工作中，干部和人民警察工作认真、态度和蔼，不但彻底增进了警民关系，且获得市民一致赞扬。
