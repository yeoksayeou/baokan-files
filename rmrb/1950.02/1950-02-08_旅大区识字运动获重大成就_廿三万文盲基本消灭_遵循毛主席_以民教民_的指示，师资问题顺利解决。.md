Xinhua News Agency: The plan to basically eliminate illiteracy within two years in the Lüda District through the promotion of literacy education has, after one year of the literacy campaign, basically eliminated illiteracy among more than 230,000 of the district's 280,000+ illiterate people. The plan is expected to be completed within the year.

The total population of Lüda District is 920,736, with approximately 283,427 illiterate people, of which 50,713 are workers, and the rest are mostly farmers. At the beginning of last year, the Lüda Administrative Office proposed in the outline of the construction plan for the two years of 1949-1950: "Carry out a literacy campaign, requiring workers to recognize at least 1,200 characters and farmers to recognize 1,000 characters within two years, basically eliminating the current phenomenon of 300,000 illiterate people." In March, the "Preliminary Plan for Carrying out the Literacy Campaign" was announced, and the Lüda Literacy Campaign Committee Headquarters was established. Key investigations and studies were conducted in five neighborhoods in Dalian (one in each district), and three types of teaching materials were compiled and printed: workers' literacy textbooks, farmers' literacy textbooks, and mass culture textbooks. At the same time, literacy campaign committees were successively established in each city, county, district, neighborhood, and village to train teachers and conduct extensive publicity and mobilization among the masses, raise cultural funds, build eight local cultural centers, ninety-two cultural clubs, and three hundred and twenty-two cultural stations, and equip one thousand one hundred and seventy-six literacy schools and one thousand five hundred and thirty-six literacy classes. Typical teaching experiments were conducted in Dalian City.

From March to the end of the year, a total of 246,093 people in the region regularly participated in learning, taught by 7,782 teachers (of which 7,444 were mass teachers). Generally, students recognized five or six hundred characters, and the best students had learned more than a thousand characters. Among the 43,923 students in Lüshun City, 10,924 people recognized eight hundred to one thousand two hundred characters. In Lijia Gou Village, Shuangdao District, the city could no longer find a single illiterate person, and 40% of all students recognized more than a thousand characters. The average score of the first collective test for all students in Dalian City was 66.3; the second time it was 74.2. Even elderly illiterate workers over the age of forty-five in the Fifth Branch of the Dock Workers' Union participated in learning, and more than 70% of the students recognized more than seven hundred characters. From late September, the villages, neighborhoods, districts, cities, counties, and the General Trade Union throughout the region carried out model award work, awarding 1,435 model teachers and 2,884 model students. On November 27, a region-wide literacy campaign model award conference was held, selecting 607 model students, 127 model teachers, and four or five model schools, classes, and groups.

The literacy campaign in the past ten months has gained the following experiences:

(1) In terms of mobilization, two different methods have yielded two different results: Those who adopted in-depth mobilization and patient persuasion achieved great results, while those who adopted simple administrative orders not only had little effect but even aroused resentment among the masses. For example, Lijia Gou Village, Shuangdao District, Lüshun, had previously experienced coercive orders, with punishments for not attending school. After discovering this, it was corrected. They adopted the method of solving the masses' ideological problems and are now a special model school in the Lüda area. During the mobilization process, many places guided the masses to conduct cultural grievance sessions to improve the masses' learning enthusiasm, and this method achieved great results.

(2) In terms of organizational leadership, from top to bottom, the Party, government, military, and people must fully support and participate in this movement. For example, the Party branch secretary of Lijia Gou Village in Lüshun City personally took charge of the leadership, and the cadres responsible for eliminating illiteracy took the lead in participating in learning, creating an atmosphere in the whole village where everyone regarded learning as an honor, so they achieved excellent results. On the contrary, in the first half of the year, some village-level cadres in Dalian County did not pay attention to this work, and the cadres responsible for eliminating illiteracy did not study with the masses, and some even did not participate in learning, resulting in very poor results. The masses said, "We can't see you in the mutual aid group during the day, and we can't see you in the literacy class at night. What are you village cadres doing all day?"

(3) Literacy class teachers are best to be mass teachers, which is the concrete realization of Chairman Mao's instruction of "teaching the people by the people." Now, students throughout the region reflect that mass teachers are better than other teachers, as they are patient, approachable, unpretentious, and don't talk empty words. At the same time, if the teachers are elected by the masses themselves, they will be supported by the masses. If the teachers are arbitrarily appointed by the cadres, the masses will stay away from them. In one village, among the mass teachers appointed by the cadres, one used to be a policeman. The masses reflected, "He used to be a policeman, why is he here to teach us again today?" So they were unwilling to go.

(4) The teaching staff must be patient and connect with the daily life of the masses. A teacher in Sanjianpu taught the masses more than sixty characters a day. Some teachers started by lecturing on the "History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union," which the masses did not understand, and no one went to school anymore. Some teachers patiently taught the characters needed in real life, one character at a time. Not only were the masses interested in learning, but those who had not participated in learning were also attracted to join.

(5) In terms of class, grade, and group organization, in cities, emphasis should be placed on literacy schools in a concentrated form. If it is not possible to concentrate, decentralized group learning should be adopted. In rural areas, the form of literacy classes can be the main form, and it can also take into account the decentralized conditions of rural areas. At the same time, classes are organized according to the masses' cultural level, residential area, rest time, and age, and cadres from various departments are assigned to various classes and grades in a planned way. Students with higher levels and better learning attitudes are designated to help others, and the planned organization and leadership of the masses to teach each other, learn from each other, and adopt methods such as "taking apprentices," "sending word strips," and corresponding with each other have all yielded great results.

(6) For teaching and management, mass teachers must be organized to collectively prepare lessons and regularly hold teaching research, teaching experience seminars, teaching achievement exhibitions, and students themselves discuss and formulate learning covenants, supervise, help, and criticize each other; students elect representatives to be responsible for class management and school cleaning and hygiene work.

(7) In helping the masses, especially helping women with young children solve difficulties, many schools have set up temporary nurseries, taking turns to take care of children or organizing nearby elderly women to take care of children through mutual aid methods, so that middle-aged women can study with peace of mind.

Currently, in the Lüda area, there are still nearly 50,000 illiterate and semi-literate people who have not participated in learning; among those who have participated in learning, some places have unsound leadership and no one is in charge of the work, forming a laissez-faire phenomenon; and there are still phenomena of coercion and command in some places. We are now taking advantage of the winter slack season (especially in rural areas) to seize this year's winter school and strive to overcome this phenomenon, and strive to mobilize and organize all illiterate and semi-literate people from fifteen to forty-five years old into the literacy campaign this year to complete the task of eliminating illiteracy.

The literacy campaign to eliminate illiteracy is only part of the cultural construction work, and it is a first step towards highly developed culture. Therefore, we are now starting to compile a set of textbooks for learning culture and science, and plan to train teachers to continue to develop the literacy campaign after the students have learned 1,200 characters, and further carry out the popularization of culture movement, to improve the cultural level of the working people (especially young people and adults from fifteen to thirty years old) to the level of primary school graduates in one and a half to two years.

    【新华社讯】旅大区推行识字教育二年内基本上消灭文盲的计划，经一年来的识字运动，已将该区二十八万多文盲中的二十三万多人基本上消灭文盲，该计划可于年内完成。
    旅大全区人口九二○、七三六人中，文盲总数约计有二八三、四二七人，其中工人占五○、七一三人，其余大多是农民。去年年初，旅大行政公署在一九四九至一九五○年两年的建设计划大纲里提出：“开展识字运动，两年内最低限度要求工人能识一千二百字，农民能识一千字，基本上消灭目前三十万人文盲现象。”在三月间公布了“开展识字运动初步方案”，组成旅大识字运动委员会总会，在大连五个坊（每区一个）进行了重点调查研究，分别编印了工人、农民识字课本及大众文化课本三种教材。同时各市、县一直到区、坊、村也都先后组成了识字运动委员会，进行训练教师和在群众中广泛的进行了宣传动员，募集了文化基金，修建了八个地方文化馆、九二个文化俱乐部和三二二处文化站，设备了一、一七六处识字学校，一、五三六个识字班。在大连市进行了典型教学试验。
    从三月开始到年底，全地区已经有二四六、○九三人经常参加了学习，由七、七八二名教师（其中七、四四四名是群众教师）担任教学，一般的学生都认得了五、六百个字，成绩最好的已经学会了一千多字。旅顺市四三、九二三名学员中间，认识八百到一千二百字的已经有一○、九二四人。该市双岛区李家沟村，已经找不到一个不识字的人，全部学员已经有百分之四十认识了一千多个字。大连市全市学员第一次集体测验平均分数为六六·三；第二次为七四·二；码头工会第五分会连四十五岁以上的老年文盲都参加学习，百分之七十以上的学员认识了七百多个字。全地区九月下旬开始村、坊、区、市、县及总工会分别进行奖模工作，受奖模范教师一、四三五人，模范学员二、八八四人。十一月二十七日，召开了一个全区的识字运动奖模大会，评议出六○七个模范学员，一二七个模范教师和四五个模范校、班、组。
    十个月来的识字运动，获得了下列几点经验：
    （一）在动员工作上，两种不同的方法收到两种不同的效果：凡采取深入动员，耐心说服态度的，成效就大，只采取简单行政命令办法的，不但收效小，甚至引起群众的反感。如旅顺双岛区李家沟村，过去也曾经发生过强迫命令的事情，不上学受处罚，发现后即加以纠正。他们采取了解决群众思想问题的方法，现在成了旅大地区的特等模范学校。在动员过程中，许多地方引导群众进行文化诉苦，来提高群众学习情绪，这种方式收到了很大的效果。
    （二）在组织领导上，从上到下要做到党、政、军、民全力支持和参加这一运动。如旅顺市李家沟党的支部书记，亲自掌握领导，扫除文盲工作的干部以身作则参加学习，全村造成了一种人人以学习为光荣的风气，所以得到优越的成绩。相反的，大连县上半年有些村子的村级干部没有重视这一工作，扫除文盲工作的干部都不和群众在一起学习，甚至有的不参加学习，结果成绩非常不好，群众说：“白天在互助组里看不见你们，晚上在识字班里也看不见你们，你们村干部整天干些什么？”
    （三）识字班教师最好是群众教师，这是毛主席指示“以民教民”的具体实现。现在全地区学员们反映，群众教师比其他教师好，既耐心，又容易接近，不摆架子，不说空话。同时，如果是群众自己推选的老师，就能得到群众的拥护，如果是干部随便指定的教师，群众就离他远远的。有一个村子，干部指定的群众教师中，有一个过去是当巡捕的，群众反映说：“过去他当巡捕，今天他怎样又来教咱们？”于是就不愿去了。
    （四）教学的人要耐心，要跟群众日常生活联系起来。三间堡有一个教师，一天给群众教了六十多个字，有的教师开始便讲“联共党史”，群众听不懂，谁都不去上学了。有的教员根据实际生活需要的字，耐心的一个字一个字的教，不但群众学着有兴趣，没参加学习的也被吸引进来了。
    （五）在班、级和小组编制上，在城市里要强调以集中形式的识字学校为主，实在不能集中的，就采取分散形式的小组学习。在农村里，可以识字班的形式为主，他又更多的照顾到农村分散的条件。同时按群众文化程度、居住区域、休息时间和年龄编班，并且有计划的把各部门的干部分配在各种班、级里面，以及指定程度较高、学习态度较好的学员帮助别人，有计划地组织和领导由群众教群众，互教互学和采取“带徒弟”、“送字条”、互相通信等方法，收效都很大。
    （六）对教学和管理上，必须组织群众教师集体准备课和定期举行教学研究、教学经验座谈会、教学成绩展览会、和由学员们自己讨论规定学习公约，互相督促、帮助和批评；由学员选举代表负责学级管理工作，和学校清洁卫生工作。
    （七）在帮助群众，特别是帮助有小孩子的妇女解决困难方面，许多学校都创办了临时托儿所，轮流照料小孩或采取变工互助的方法组织临近的老年妇女照料小孩，使壮年妇女们安心学习。
    目前旅大全地区，还有将近五万名文盲和半文盲没有参加学习；已经参加学习的，还有一些地方领导不健全，工作没人管，形成自流现象；部分地方还存在着强迫命令的现象。现在正利用冬季农闲（特别农村），抓紧今年的冬学，努力克服这种现象，争取本年内把所有从十五岁到四十五岁的文盲、半文盲全部动员和组织到识字运动中来，完成扫除文盲的任务。
    消灭文盲现象的识字运动，只是文化建设的一部分工作，是向高度文化发展的一种开步走的工作。因此，现在正着手编辑一套学习文化、科学用的教材，并计划训练教师，准备在学员们学会了一千二百字以后，继续把识字运动向前发展，进一步开展文化普及运动，以一年半到两年的时间，把劳动人民（特别是从十五岁到三十岁的青年和壮年）的文化程度，提高到高小毕业生的水平。
