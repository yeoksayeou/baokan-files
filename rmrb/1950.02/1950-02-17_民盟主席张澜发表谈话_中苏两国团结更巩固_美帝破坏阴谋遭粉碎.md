Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 16th: Zhang Lan, Chairman of the China Democratic League, today issued a statement on the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance, and Mutual Assistance as follows:

　　On February 14th, the two major allied nations, China and the Soviet Union, signed the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance, and Mutual Assistance in Moscow, as well as agreements on the Changchun Railway, Lushun, Dalian, loans, and other matters. The signing of this new treaty and agreements is not only truly based on the principles of equality and mutual benefit, but the Soviet Union has also provided even more favorable assistance to the new China. This is unprecedented in the history of Chinese diplomacy and in the history of world diplomacy. We feel immense excitement and joy. Our China Democratic League wholeheartedly supports the new treaty and agreements.

　　Since the October Revolution, the Soviet Union has consistently been concerned about and has assisted the Chinese people's liberation struggle. For many years, the people of China and the Soviet Union have always been intimately friendly and united. The world imperialist aggression group headed by American imperialism and its running dogs in China—the Chiang Kai-shek reactionary group—have in the past tried every possible means to spread rumors, provoke, and sow discord, attempting to undermine the friendship and unity of the people of the two great nations. But, on the contrary, the friendship and unity of the people of the two great nations has become increasingly deep and strengthened. The signing of this new treaty and agreements demonstrates that the friendship and unity of the people of the two great nations is even closer and more consolidated. This thoroughly smashes all the conspiracies and tricks of the world imperialist aggression group headed by American imperialism, which aimed to undermine the unity of the two great allied nations, China and the Soviet Union.

　　For more than a hundred years, imperialists have constantly oppressed and invaded China, and have constantly sabotaged and attacked the Chinese people's liberation struggle. However, the Chinese people, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and with the assistance of the Soviet Union, have been firmly united, eliminated the reactionary rule, driven out the aggressive forces of the imperialists headed by American imperialism, and established a people's regime. But the imperialists' acts of aggression will not cease. Isn't American imperialism today actively plotting its aggression in the Far East and even the entire world? The signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance, and Mutual Assistance is precisely the answer to this question. From now on, the two great allied nations, China and the Soviet Union, will have a greater defensive force against imperialist aggression. We are closely allied with the Soviet Union. The two great allied nations will jointly prevent "the resurgence of aggression and disruption of peace by Japan or any other state that directly or indirectly colludes with Japan in acts of aggression." The two great allied nations will jointly participate in "all international activities aimed at ensuring world peace and security." The two great allied nations "shall not conclude any alliance directed against the other party, nor participate in any group or any action or measures directed against the other party." This shows that the signing of the new Sino-Soviet treaty thoroughly strikes a blow against the aggressive conspiracies of the American imperialists in the Far East and even the entire world, consolidates the foundation of peace in the Far East, strengthens the world people's democratic and peaceful front led by the Soviet Union, and weakens the aggressive forces of the imperialists headed by American imperialism.

　　The two agreements signed simultaneously with the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance, and Mutual Assistance stipulate that the Soviet Union will return the Changchun Railway to China, transfer Lushun and Dalian to China, and provide substantial economic assistance for the construction of the new China. What the Soviet Union has given us is indeed more beneficial and more powerful assistance. This shows how sincerely and wholeheartedly the Soviet Union has been assisting the success of the Chinese revolution. Have we encountered such a close fraternal country in history? This also thoroughly eliminates all the slanders and smears spread by the imperialist aggression group headed by American imperialism against the Soviet Union, and enables the people of the whole world to have a more correct understanding of socialist Soviet Union.

　　The Chinese people should greatly celebrate the signing of the new treaty and agreements between the two great allied nations, China and the Soviet Union, and should widely publicize it, so that every person understands that the Soviet Union is our true friend, and that the policy of leaning to one side advocated by Chairman Mao is great and correct. I would like to represent the China Democratic League in thanking Chairman Mao and Premier Zhou, because they have made such a great contribution to the new China. Similarly, we want to thank Marshal Stalin and the people of the Soviet Union.

　　民盟主席张澜发表谈话
    中苏两国团结更巩固  美帝破坏阴谋遭粉碎
    【新华社北京十六日电】中国民主同盟张澜主席今日对中苏友好同盟互助条约发表谈话如下：
    本月十四日，中苏两大盟邦在莫斯科签订了中苏友好互助同盟条约，及关于长春铁路、旅大、贷款等协定，这新条约和协定的签订，不只是真正基于平等互利的原则，而且苏联对新中国作了更有利的帮助，在中国外交史上是空前的，在世界外交史上也是空前的。使我们感到莫大的兴奋、欢快。我们中国民主同盟对于新条约和协定，是竭诚拥护的。
    苏联自十月革命以来，对于中国人民解放斗争，一直地是关切、援助。中苏两大国的人民，多少年来始终是亲切地友爱、团结。以美帝为首的世界帝国主义侵略集团及其在中国的走狗——蒋介石反动集团，过去千方百计的造谣、挑拨、离间，期图破坏两大国人民的友爱、团结。但相反的两大国人民的友爱团结，是日益地深切、加强起来。这次新条约和协定的签订，是表现中苏两大国人民的友爱、团结、更密切更巩固了。这是彻底地粉碎了以美帝为首的世界帝国主义侵略集团期图破坏中苏两大盟国团结的一切阴谋诡计。
    百余年来帝国主义者一直地压迫、侵略中国，对于中国人民解放斗争一直地破坏打击；而中国人民在中共领导下、苏联盟邦协助下，坚强地团结在一起，消灭了反动的统治，赶走了以美帝为首的帝国主义者的侵略的势力，建立起人民的政权。但帝国主义者的侵略行为是不会中止的。今天美帝国主义者不是在远东以至全世界积极地布置其侵略的阴谋吗？中苏友好互助同盟条约的签订，正是答复了这个问题。从今以后，中苏两大盟国，对于帝国主义的侵略有了更伟大的防御力量。我们与苏联紧密地靠在一起。两大盟国共同制止“日本或其他直接间接在侵略行为上与日本相勾结的任何国家之重新侵略与破坏和平”。两大盟国共同参加“所有以确保世界和平和安全为目的之国际活动”。两大盟国“不缔结反对对方的任何同盟并不参加反对对方任何集团及任何行动及措施”。这说明了中苏新条约的签订，彻底地打击了美帝国主义者在远东以至全世界的侵略阴谋，巩固了远东的和平基础，加强了以苏联为领导的全世界人民民主和平的阵线，削弱了以美帝为首的帝国主义者的侵略势力。
    与中苏友好互助同盟条约同时签订的两个协定，规定苏联将把长春铁路交还中国，旅大移交中国，而又对新中国建设方面给予大量的经济援助。苏联盟邦所给予我们的的确是更有利更有力的帮助。这表现苏联对于中国革命事业的成功是怎样竭诚地尽心尽力地帮助。我们在历史上遇到过这样亲切的兄弟之邦吗？这也彻底地消除了以美帝为首的帝国主义侵略集团对苏联种种造谣毁谤的诬蔑，使全世界的人民对于社会主义的苏联有更正确的认识。
    中国人民对于中苏两大盟国新条约及协定的签订，应该大大地庆祝，应该广泛地宣传，让每一个人民都了解苏联是我们真正的友邦，毛主席所号召一面倒的政策是伟大而正确的。我要代表中国民主同盟感谢毛主席和周总理，因为他们对于新中国有了这样伟大的贡献。同样地，我们要感谢斯大林大元帅和苏联的人民。
