(Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 8th) People from all walks of life in Northeast China firmly support the Soviet government's proposal to try Japanese bacteriological warfare criminals and unanimously demand that a special international military tribunal be formed to try them as soon as possible. The Northeast General Branch of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association issued a written statement on behalf of 880,000 members, accusing the Japanese army of crimes in the Northeast, saying: The plague caused by the Japanese imperialists manufacturing plague bacteria in the Northeast spread throughout the Northeast and caused great harm. In Tongliao County, Liaobei Province alone, more than 12,000 people died of the plague in 1947. Fortunately, the Soviet anti-epidemic team was invited to the Northeast for treatment, and after three years of work, the plague was eradicated. This great friendship is unforgettable. We sincerely support this solemn proposal of the Soviet government. In a statement, the Northeast Democratic Women's Federation firmly demanded that Japanese bacteriological warfare criminals headed by Hirohito be tried as soon as possible to avenge the murdered people. At the same time, medical and judicial workers, as well as workers, women, students, youth groups, and political and military organs in various provinces and cities in Northeast China, have successively issued supportive speeches or statements. Zhang Yunlong, President of the Shenyang Municipal People's Court, said: These culprits, under the protection of American war mongers, have not only not received the punishment they deserve, but are still at large, which the Chinese people will never tolerate. The first session of the People's Congress of Liaodong Province sent a telegram to the Central People's Government stating: We, the entire representatives, on behalf of the 8,510,000 people in the province, unanimously support the solemn proposal of the Soviet government, which demonstrates great concern for world peace and the safety of all mankind. Representatives of medical workers from the Health Department of the Liaoxi Provincial People's Government and the Health Cadre School held a symposium specifically on this matter. At the meeting, everyone firmly stated: This blood debt of the Japanese war criminals must be repaid! Gao Jingzhi, Secretary of the Jilin Provincial Committee of the Communist Youth League, and Li Kejun, Chairman of the Jilin Provincial Student Federation, issued written opinions, unanimously believing that China is a country that has been directly harmed by bacteriological weapons and has the greatest right to accuse and punish this serious crime against humanity. The persons in charge of the Songjiang Provincial Federation of Trade Unions and the Rehe Provincial Federation of Trade Unions Preparatory Committee believe that organizing a special international military tribunal to try bacteriological warfare criminals such as Hirohito is to prevent the resurgence of Japanese aggressive forces and to warn new war provocateurs. Youth and student groups in Harbin firmly support the Soviet government's proposal and pointed out that at Pingfang Station, 20 kilometers away from Harbin, the Japanese army used bacteria to kill many compatriots in order to carry out heinous experiments.
	Shenyang's Northeast Daily and Qiqihar's Heilongjiang Daily published the Soviet government's note to our government on the issue of Japanese bacteriological warfare criminals in prominent positions on the front page. Northeast Daily also published a commentary stating: The Soviet government's note has pointed out with irrefutable facts that Hirohito, Ishii, and others are the main organizers and leaders of this crime. The charges are established, and the case is as solid as a mountain. Anyone who protects them should be guilty of the same crime as them.

　　东北各界拥护审判细菌战犯
    要求为被害人民复仇
    对苏联帮助肃清鼠疫的友谊永志不忘
    【新华社北京八日电】东北各界人民坚决拥护苏联政府关于审讯日本细菌战犯的建议，并一致要求早日组成特别国际军事法庭予以审讯。中苏友好协会东北总分会代表八十八万会员发表书面声明，控诉日军在东北的罪行称：日本帝国主义在东北制造鼠疫细菌所引起的鼠疫，曾蔓延东北各地，为害甚大。只是一九四七年在辽北省通辽一县，死于鼠疫的就有一万二千余人。幸有苏联防疫队应聘来东北救治，经过三年的工作，才将鼠疫肃清。这种伟大的友谊是令人永志不忘的。我们竭诚拥护苏联政府这个严正的提议。东北民主妇女联合会在声明中，坚决要求从速审讯以裕仁为首的日本细菌战犯，为被害的人民复仇。同时，东北各省、市的医务、司法工作者以及工人、妇女、学生、青年等团体和政、军机关，都纷纷发表了拥护的谈话或声明。沈阳市人民法院院长章云龙说：这些祸首在美国战争贩子庇护下，非但未受到应得的惩处，却依然逍遥法外，这是中国人民绝不能容忍的。辽东省首届各界人民代表会议致电中央人民政府称：我们全体代表谨代表全省八百五十一万人民，一致拥护苏联政府这一表现对世界和平及对全人类安全巨大关心的严正提议。辽西省人民政府卫生处和卫生干部学校的医务工作者代表，专为此事召开座谈会。会上大家坚决表示：日本战犯这笔血债，必须偿还！青年团吉林省工作委员会书记高景之、吉林省学生联合会主席李克均发表书面意见，一致认为中国是曾经直接受到细菌武器毒害的国家，有最大的权利来控诉和制裁这种违反人道的严重罪行。松江省总工会和热河省总工会筹委会负责人都认为：组织特别国际军事法庭来审讯裕仁等细菌战犯，是为了制止日本侵略势力的再起，同时也是警告新战争挑拨者。哈尔滨市的青年和学生团体坚决拥护苏联政府的提议，并指出：就在距离哈市二十公里的平房车站，日军曾经为进行罪恶的实验，用细菌害死了许多同胞。
    沈阳东北日报和齐齐哈尔市黑龙江日报，都以头版显著地位刊出苏联政府关于日本细菌战犯问题致我国政府的照会文。东北日报并发表时评称：苏联政府照会已以无可驳辩的事实指出裕仁、石井等正是这一罪行的主要组织者和领导者。罪名确立，铁案如山，谁若庇护他们，便应和他们同罪。
