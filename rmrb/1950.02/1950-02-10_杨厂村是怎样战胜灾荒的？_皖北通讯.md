　　How Yangchang Village Overcame the Disaster?
    ——Anhui North Communication——
    Yangchang Village, in Sihong County (a newly established county between Siyang and Hongze Lake) of the severely affected Suxian Prefecture in northern Anhui, has seen its disaster situation alleviated since all the villagers organized themselves to engage in diverse sideline production. Currently, the entire village is actively preparing for spring plowing.

    Yangchang Village has a total of 155 households and 764 residents. In the summer and autumn of last year, it suffered continuous flooding, and almost all the autumn crops were submerged. Only the 500 mu of land on the river embankment yielded 42,000 jin of grain, with an average of only 55 jin per person for the entire village. Under such severe disaster conditions, the villagers were panic-stricken, and some village cadres were also somewhat pessimistic. Some people said, "This year there is water everywhere, and there is nowhere to borrow from. The only options are to flee the famine or starve to death." Some villagers didn't even want to plant wheat. Some sold their cattle one after another. The village originally had 45 head of cattle, and in a few days, 17 were sold.

    At this time, the Anhui North District Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Anhui North Administrative Office were vigorously calling for production to provide disaster relief. Zhuang Shixin, the village head, returned from attending the township's production self-help mobilization meeting with greatly increased confidence. He consulted with village cadres and experienced elders on how to survive the disaster. After careful study, everyone felt that fleeing the famine was not a solution. If wheat wasn't planted this year, there would be another disaster next year. Zhuang Houping, the director of the farmers' association, said, "Diligent people won't starve to death in famine years, and lazy people can still starve to death in bumper years!" Thus, everyone realized that as long as all the villagers worked together, thought of more ways, did whatever they could, and did whatever was beneficial, they would definitely be able to overcome the disaster.

    From the beginning of October, village cadres began to organize various production teams according to the villagers' production skills and tools. For example, Zhuang Houliang, the deputy director of the farmers' association, first organized 60 households with nets and boats to form six fishing teams. Deputy Village Chief Yang Youguang and Zhuang Houyi had experience in transporting salt since they were young, so they organized 14 households to transport salt. Zhuang Fulin and others had leather rafts and small boats, so they formed two teams to cut cow grass in the lake. He Yekui and Yang Xiuzhi were familiar with weaving, so they led more than 20 households to weave cloth. Zhuang Houping had experience in transporting grass and peddling vegetables, so he led 18 households to carry grass and peddle vegetables. Village Chief Zhuang Shixin also led nine households to make oil. With the development of these sideline productions, the village also established fish-carrying teams and spinning teams. Up to now, the village has organized more than 400 people to engage in production. More than 60 children in the village were also organized into grass-picking teams.

    In leading production, Village Chief Zhuang Shixin often paid attention to the production of each team and changes in objective conditions, and promptly helped everyone overcome difficulties. For example, when the fishing team started, 42 households did not have nets, so the village chief organized them to buy hemp, and in a few days, they knitted five large nets, three medium nets, and 30 shrimp nets. When the water in the river gradually receded, in order to prevent the fish from flowing away with the water, the village chief discussed with everyone and built 45 fish ponds in five days, and stipulated that they would not fish on weekdays. Until mid-November, when fish was expensive and grain was cheap, the fishing team caught a total of 5,000 jin of fish, earning 2,000 jin of grain. In December, because it rained continuously for half a month and the river water rose, when the fishing team could not catch fish, the village chief organized 41 able-bodied laborers from the idled fishing households to participate in the internal river engineering project, and also organized nine households to transport bean cakes. When the weaving team started production, the village chief went to the market and signed a contract with cloth dealers to exchange cloth for yarn, so that the weaving production could continue. The grass-cutting team cut more than 21,000 jin of grass, and the village chief asked someone to find a buyer, exchanging 100 jin of grass for 20 jin of grain, earning a total of more than 4,000 jin of grain. In addition, the village also planned to solve the production and living difficulties of 16 households of revolutionary martyrs' families, military families, workers' families, veterans, and orphans who could not survive. It organized five households to cook for the river-digging team, three households to make spindles in the weaving team, two households were given capital to spin yarn, and six households were placed in other production teams to provide care in life. At the same time, the village also launched mutual assistance for villagers who lacked production funds. For example, the salt transport team helped eight households participate in production, and the weaving team helped seven households participate in production.

    After the entire village organized various sideline productions and launched mutual aid and mutual assistance in production, the disaster situation has gradually been alleviated over the past four months. The number of households without food has decreased from 21 to 16 (these households have now participated in production or have been taken care of separately), the number of households with enough food has increased from 22 to 47, the number of households with enough food until the end of the lunar year has increased from 40 to 42, and the number of households with enough food until the second lunar month has increased from 38 to 48.

    Since entering winter, in order to shorten the spring famine, the villagers have actively launched winter plowing and winter planting. So far, the entire village has planted 2,112 mu of wheat, bought back nine head of livestock, and adopted the method of group livestock raising. The grass-cutting team and children also cut cow grass in sideline production to ensure that the village's livestock will no longer leave the village. Currently, the villagers are picking up manure and accumulating fertilizer, and are also preparing to mobilize 100 laborers to jointly build a small waterproof dike with neighboring villages in five days, actively preparing for spring plowing.

　　杨厂村是怎样战胜灾荒的？
    ——皖北通讯——
    受灾严重的皖北宿县专区泗洪县（新设县、在泗阳与洪泽湖之间）杨厂村，自全村灾民组织起来展开多种多样的副业生产后，灾情业已减轻，目前全村正积极进行春耕准备工作。
    杨厂村居民共有一百五十五户，七百六十四人。去年夏、秋两季连续遭受水灾，秋禾几乎全部被淹。仅河堤上的五百亩地收了四万二千斤粮，全村平均每人只收到五十五斤。在这样严重的灾情下，全村农民人心惶惶，村干部也有些悲观。有人说：“今年遍地是水，想借也没处借，除了逃荒就只有饿死。”村民有的连麦子也不想种了。有的纷纷卖牛。村上原有牛四十五头，不几天就卖了十七头。
    这时，正值中共皖北区党委和皖北行署大力号召生产救灾。该村村长庄士信参加了乡的生产自救动员会回来后，信心大增，和村干部及渡荒有经验的老年人商量。经过仔细的研究后，大家都觉得逃荒不是办法，今年麦子种不上，明年还要闹灾荒的。农会主任庄厚平说：“荒年饿不死勤劳人，丰收年成还能饿死懒汉哩！”于是，大家认识到只要全村人民一齐动手，多想办法，能干什么就干什么，什么有利就干什么，那就一定能够克服灾荒的。
    从十月初旬起，该村干部就分头按村民的生产技能和生产工具，组织了各种生产小组。如农会副主任庄厚良首先组织六十户有网有船的灾民成立了六个捕鱼组。副村长杨有光、庄厚义从小运过盐，有经验，有门路，于是就组织十四户去运盐。庄福林等有皮筏子和小船，便组成两个组下湖砍牛草。何业奎、杨秀芝熟悉纺织，就带领二十多户织布。庄厚平对运草、贩菜有门路，就带了十八户挑草、贩菜。村长庄士信又带领九户进行打油。随着这些副业生产的开展，该村又成立了挑鱼组、纺纱组等。到现在为止，该村已组织起四百多人进行生产。该村六十多个儿童也被组织在拾草队里面。
    在领导生产上，该村村长庄士信经常注意到各组的生产情况和客观条件的变化，及时帮助大家克服困难。如捕鱼组开始时有四十二户没有网，村长就组织他们去买麻，不几天就结成了大网五条、中网三条、虾网三十条。在水河逐渐下落时，为不使鱼随水流去，村长就和大家商讨，在五天中用树枝造了四十五个鱼塘，并规定平日不打鱼，直至十一月中旬鱼贵粮贱时，捕鱼组共打了五千斤鱼，赚了二千斤粮。到十二月里，因为接连下了半个月阴雨，河水上涨，捕鱼组捕不到鱼时，村长便将歇业的捕鱼户组织四十一个全劳动力去参加修治内河工程，又组织九户去运豆饼。当织布组开始生产时，村长就到集上和布贩订了以布换纱的合同，使织布生产能继续下去。砍草组砍了二万一千多斤草，村长便托人找买主，以草百斤换粮二十斤，共得粮四千多斤。此外，该村还有计划地解决了十六户无法生活的烈、军、工属、荣军和孤独户的生产上和生活上的困难。计组织了五户参加挖河组烧饭，三户在织布组打罗管，二户贷给资本纺纱，六户安插在其他生产组里给予生活上的照顾。同时，对缺乏生产资金的村民，村里也展开互济。如运盐组共帮助了八户参加生产，织布组帮助了七户参加生产。
    经过全村组织起来进行各种各样的副业生产和在生产中展开了互助互济后，四个月来，灾情已逐步减轻。断炊户由二十一户减少为十六户（这几户现都已参加生产或分别得到照顾），够吃户由二十二户增到四十七户，吃够到旧历年底者由四十户增加到四十二户，够吃到旧历二月者由三十八户增到四十八户。
    入冬以后，该村农民为缩短春荒，积极展开冬耕冬种，到目前为止，全村已种下麦子二千一百十二亩，买回牲口九头，并采取伙养牲口的办法，由砍草组和儿童在副业生产中附带砍牛草，保证该村牲口不再出庄。目前该村农民正在拾粪、积肥，还准备动员一百个工以五天的时间和邻村合筑一个防水小堤，积极进行春耕准备工作。
