Issues 2.1 Billion Yuan in Agricultural Loans to Support Mass Production and Prepare for Famine

[News from this newspaper] To support mass production and prepare for famine, the People's Bank of China Henan Branch has decided to issue 2.1 billion yuan in agricultural and sideline product loans, and has established a focused disbursement plan. Of this loan, 33.2% has already been issued for wheat seed loans, while the remaining 37% will be used to support the transportation and marketing business, and 29.8% will be used to support handicrafts and sideline industries. In order to ensure that the loan is carried out in a planned manner, the branch intends to start investigating and understanding the production and sales of special crops such as cotton, tobacco, and peanuts in various special districts, the sentiments of the masses, and their difficulties and demands, and combine this with the government's call so as to disburse loans in a timely manner. Secondly, rural supply and marketing cooperatives will also be constructed in a planned and step-by-step manner according to the specific conditions in various places, and will be given low-interest loans for support. Due to the increasing output of textiles in major cities, the sales of household textiles may gradually decrease, so it is only appropriate to help maintain the status quo; however, in disaster areas, assistance should be provided in promoting the sale of native cloth. Necessary support should be given to small iron factories, agricultural tool foundries, and Mi County felt hat industry in various places depending on sales.

The focus of disbursement will be on areas where the masses are mobilized and areas severely affected by disasters. The specific allocation of funds is as follows: Xuchang Special District 513 million yuan, Nanyang Special District 273 million yuan, Huaiyang Special District 233 million yuan, Queshan Special District 203 million yuan, Shangqiu Special District 188 million yuan, Luoyang Special District 182 million yuan, Chenliu Special District 138 million yuan, Zhengzhou Special District 169 million yuan, Huangchuan Special District 107 million yuan, and Shanzhou Special District 96 million yuan.

    发放农贷廿一亿元  扶助群众生产备荒
    【本报讯】中国人民银行河南省分行为扶助群众生产备荒，确定发放二十一亿农副业折实贷款，并订立有重点的发放计划。该项贷款除麦种贷款占百分之三三．二已发放外，其余百分之三七决定用以扶植运销事业；百分之二九．八用以扶植手工业及副业。为使贷款有计划地进行，分行拟即着手调查了解各专区棉花、烟叶、花生等特种作物的产销情况、群众情绪及其困难与要求等，并结合政府号召，以便及时发放，其次对农村供销合作社亦将有计划、有步骤地根据各地具体情况进行建设，予以低利贷款扶植。对家庭纺织因各大城市纺织产量日增，销路可能渐少，因此只宜帮助维持现状；但在灾区则应帮助土布之推销。对各地小型铁工厂、农具翻砂厂，及密县毡帽业应依销路予以必要之扶助。
    发放地区，着重于群众发动区及灾情严重区。其资金之具体分配为：许昌专区五亿一千三百万，南阳专区二亿七千三百万，淮阳专区二亿三千三百万，确山专区二亿零三百万，商邱专区一亿八千八百万，洛阳专区一亿八千二百万，陈留专区一亿三千八百万，郑州专区一亿六千九百万，潢川专区一亿零七千万，陕州专区九千六百万。
