　　The General Post Office Issues Nationally Universal Stamps
    [This Newspaper's Report] To unify the supply of stamps, the General Post Office of the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications has ordered a batch of nationally universal (excluding Northeast) ordinary stamps from the Shanghai Commercial Press. The design is a slightly modified version of the Tiananmen pattern stamp issued by the former North China Postal Administration, removing the airplane in the sky and changing the bottom to read "中国人民邮政" (China People's Post) in six characters. The denominations are divided into nine types: 200 yuan (green), 300 yuan (purple), 500 yuan (scarlet), 800 yuan (orange-red), 1,000 yuan (blue-purple), 2,000 yuan (olive green), 5,000 yuan (light red), 8,000 yuan (blue), and 10,000 yuan (brown). Among them, the 800-yuan denomination has already begun to be distributed to post offices for sale. The stamps used in the Northeast are printed by the Northeast Postal and Telecommunications Administration itself. The design is the same, but they are printed with the words "东北贴用" (Northeast Use Only). The denominations are calculated in Northeast currency, and those already issued include nine types: 500 yuan (imitation gold), 1,000 yuan (red-yellow), 1,500 yuan (deep yellow), 2,000 yuan (green-tea color), 5,000 yuan (orange-yellow), 10,000 yuan (orange-tea color), 20,000 yuan (tea color), 35,000 yuan (blue), and 50,000 yuan (green).
