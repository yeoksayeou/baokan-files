Xinhua News Agency, Prague, 18th. The Paris edition of the New York Herald Tribune on the 14th published a dispatch from the United Press on the 13th from Chiayi, Taiwan, confirming that American imperialists are the masterminds behind the recent bombing of peaceful residents in Shanghai by Kuomintang bandit aircraft. The United Press reported that retired U.S. Navy Admiral Cooke (former commander of the U.S. Western Pacific Fleet) spoke at a certain Kuomintang air force base in Taiwan at the invitation of Soong Mei-ling. This admiral, while speaking to the Kuomintang air force personnel who recently indiscriminately bombed Shanghai, praised these personnel's "morale" and lauded their insane and bestial acts of killing thousands of Shanghai citizens as being "recorded in history." Cooke said: "Now is the most urgent time. Your work will be recorded in history for hundreds of years to come."
