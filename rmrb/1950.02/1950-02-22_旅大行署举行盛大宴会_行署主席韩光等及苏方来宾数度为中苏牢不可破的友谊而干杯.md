Xinhua News Agency, Dalian, 21st — The Lüda Administrative Office held a grand banquet on the 18th to celebrate the signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance, and Mutual Assistance and other agreements. Attendees included Han Guang, Chairman of the Administrative Office; Qiao Chuanjue, President of the Lüda Sino-Soviet Friendship Association; Guo Shushen, Deputy Secretary of the CPC Lüda District Committee; and responsible individuals from various enterprises, organizations, schools, and government agencies, as well as labor heroes, technical workers, and university professors. Soviet guests included General Beloborodov, Major General Oushin, Major General Chuiponoch, Major General Nigishin, Major General Raskazov, Colonel Bashen, Soviet Consul General in Dalian Baranov, Vice Consul Krushevsky, and Soviet heads of Soviet-operated and Sino-Soviet joint venture factories, as well as representatives of Soviet foreign trade. The banquet began in an atmosphere of excitement and warmth. Chairman Han Guang said in his speech that the signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance, and Mutual Assistance has been supported by the Chinese people and peace-loving people all over the world. In particular, the people of Lüda, who have personally experienced the deep friendship between China and the Soviet Union for more than four years, are even more infinitely delighted and inspired, and are transforming this feeling into practical organizational strength to further strengthen and consolidate Sino-Soviet friendship. A representative of the Soviet military command said that these treaties and agreements, which are in line with the interests of the Soviet Union and China and all progressive mankind, are the greatest contribution to the cause of world peace and democracy and a fatal blow to the imperialist warmongers. The conclusion of these treaties and agreements clearly demonstrates the Soviet Union's brotherly assistance to China and illustrates to the world that the Soviet Union respects the national independence and sovereignty of the Chinese people. Guo Shushen, representative of the CPC Lüda District Committee, said that the people of Lüda have deeply benefited from the fraternal assistance of Soviet comrades, and can more deeply appreciate the greatness of Stalin's diplomatic policy reflected in this treaty and other agreements. He called on all Communist Party members in the Lüda area to more actively learn from Soviet comrades the experience of construction in all fields, as well as the spirit of overcoming difficulties, creating, researching, and being realistic, and to support the new treaty and other agreements with practical actions. Qiao Chuanjue, President of the Lüda Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, said: We firmly support the signing of the new treaty and agreements, and are willing to work doubly hard to implement the spirit of the new treaty, further develop Sino-Soviet friendship work, and consolidate and develop the Friendship Association organization. During the meeting, Han Guang, Guo Shushen, and Soviet guests repeatedly proposed toasts to celebrate the unbreakable friendship between the people of China and the Soviet Union, and to the health of Marshal Stalin and Chairman Mao.
