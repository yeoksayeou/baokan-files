Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 14th: The People's Railway Daily published an editorial entitled "Oppose Complacency, Strengthen Technical Management, Eliminate Accidents, and Ensure Safe Train Operation." The full text is as follows:

　　The railway is a vast technical organization. The basic requirement of railway technical management is to ensure the safety of train operations in order to fully utilize railway efficiency and complete national transportation tasks.

　　Since the commencement of the Ministry of Railways' 1950 annual plan, although most railway administrations completed or exceeded their January loading targets, major accidents have occurred continuously. On January 12th, at the Nanzhangcun Station of the Taiyuan Railway Administration, a train collision occurred because the driver disregarded signals (i.e., the driver proceeded into the station despite signal indications to stop). On January 23rd, at the Huaqiying Station of the Jinan Railway Administration, a train head-on collision occurred because a switchman threw the switch incorrectly, resulting in 62 deaths and injuries, the most serious accident since the establishment of the Ministry of Railways. On February 3rd, between Liyuan and Houma on the Taiyuan Railway Administration line, a train collision, locomotive overturning, and complete train derailment accident occurred because the engineering section illegally and arbitrarily used a small railcar. On February 4th, at Cangxian Station of the Tianjin Railway Administration, another train collision accident occurred because a switchman threw the switch incorrectly. On February 7th, at Leiyang Station of the Hengyang Railway Administration, a train collision accident occurred because a coupler arbitrarily moved a locomotive. According to the accident statistics reported to the Ministry by various bureaus on February 7th, from January 1st to February 5th, a total of 373 major accidents and operational accidents occurred on railways nationwide: 20 train collisions, 93 vehicle derailments, 103 train separations, and 157 injuries (including one in-car explosion). A total of 84 people were killed or injured, 3 locomotives and 31 vehicles were damaged. The losses caused by train blockages due to accidents have not yet been tallied. These accidents have caused enormous losses to people's lives and state property, which is an intolerable offense.

　　Why did these major accidents occur?

　　From the continuous series of malignant accidents, it can be seen that even the most basic regulations of our railway technical management no longer exist. Drivers arbitrarily disregard signals, switchmen throw switches incorrectly, signalmen pull wires without a proper signal indication, engineering sections arbitrarily use small railcars without the stationmaster's permission, duty stationmasters do not receive trains properly, and couplers can freely move locomotives. These egregious acts of violating regulations and destroying discipline have not been subject to timely and appropriate sanctions on our railways. Although this is a continuation of the corrupt practices of the Kuomintang era, our People's Railways have been in existence for one to four years, and such destructive behavior has already inflicted considerable losses on us. We have a responsibility to point out in a timely manner that this destructive behavior, formed by corrupt practices, is contrary to the interests of the people.

　　Some people attribute the causes of accidents to the condition of the track equipment and the climate. It is true that the track has not been repaired for long, the technical equipment is incomplete, and the climate is unfavorable. Precisely because these facts exist, it is all the more necessary to propose effective measures in technical management. On the one hand, we must strengthen technical equipment, and on the other hand, we must clarify technical management regulations in order to avoid accidents. We must never think that because of technical conditions and climate, it is impossible to avoid accidents. Some people believe that although there have been more accidents since liberation, they are still far fewer than during the Kuomintang rule. It is wrong to compare the railways managed by the people with the railways managed by the enemy and puppet regime. However, because of these erroneous views on accidents, a numb and indifferent attitude towards accidents has developed in the minds of some of our leading cadres, which has fostered the corrupt practices left over from the Kuomintang era. This is the fundamental reason for the continuous occurrence of major accidents.

　　Precisely because of the chaos in railway technical management, and precisely because of the complacency of certain leading cadres, opportunities have been provided for sabotage activities by special agents. The destructive activities that have occurred in recent days have reached an extremely unrestrained level, such as the murder of the labor hero in Nankou and the bus explosion in Beixinchengzi, Shenyang. These blatant acts of sabotage tell all our workers and staff that it is too early for us to think that we can "rest easy."

　　In view of the seriousness of the accidents, and in order to raise the vigilance of all workers and staff on the railway, eliminate major accidents, and ensure safe train operation, the Ministry of Railways has issued an emergency order, specifically stipulating emergency measures to eliminate accidents. This is an important order. All railway organizations, all leading cadres, and all workers and staff must attach importance to this order, organize themselves according to their specific circumstances, launch discussions, determine the methods and steps for each department and each individual to implement this order, and fight for the complete realization of this order and the thorough elimination of major accidents.

　　In order to ensure that the spirit of this order can be implemented, we would like to emphasize the following points:

　　1.　The chaotic style of technical management in the past was the result of the corrupt rule of the Kuomintang, and also the manifestation of the passive resistance of the vast number of workers and staff under prolonged oppression. However, today all railway workers and staff have become the masters of the country and the railways. All railway technical equipment is our own property, and we must cherish and manage it with the utmost responsibility. The chaotic style of technical management in the past must be corrected and should never be allowed to remain in our work.

　　2.　Labor discipline must be strengthened. All regulations and technical management provisions on the railways are the laws of the railways. Obeying regulations and complying with all technical management provisions is the basic obligation of all railway workers and staff. The railway is a vast technical organization. Without rules and regulations, there will inevitably be chaos. We must never try to save trouble, take chances, or rely on brute force to do things. All workers and staff who cherish the railways and state property must conscientiously abide by all the regulations on the railways and wage a resolute struggle against any behavior that violates the regulations, so as to protect the lives and property of the state and the people from loss. Any connivance or laziness in technical management will cause serious losses to the country.

　　3.　The US-Chiang reactionaries are destined to fail in the end, but they will never willingly die. They will do everything possible to carry out sabotage activities. Therefore, all railway workers and staff must raise their vigilance, strictly prevent sabotage activities by counter-revolutionary elements, and especially prevent counter-revolutionary elements from using chaos in technical management to carry out sabotage. Therefore, we must strengthen the management of all technical equipment, and organize patrol and security work to prevent counter-revolutionary elements from taking advantage of any opportunity.

　　4.　After discussing this order in all technical departments, specific measures and covenants for eliminating accidents should be formulated based on the existing conditions of various technical equipment and management regulations. A responsibility system and a joint labor system should be established, and a competition campaign for "safe kilometers" and "safe periods" should be launched. Leading organs and political organs at all levels should lead and promote this movement, so that it can be promoted throughout the national railways, in order to transform labor attitudes among all workers and staff, eliminate that corrupt style, establish the idea of safe train operation, and establish the idea of cherishing the lives of the people and the property of the state as masters of the railways.

　　Finally, we hope that the Ministry of Railways' order can be immediately implemented among all railway workers and staff throughout the country, so that our railways can present a brand new look.

　　反对麻痹，加强技术管理，消灭事故，保证行车安全
    人民铁道报社论
    【新华社北京十四日电】人民铁道报以“反对麻痹，加强技术管理，消灭事故，保证行车安全”为题发表社论，全文如下：
    铁路是一个巨大技术组成的机构，铁路技术管理的基本要求，是保证行车安全，以充分发挥铁路效率，完成国家运输任务。
    铁道部一九五○年年度计划开始以来，一月份装车任务，虽然多数管理局是完成了或超过了，但重大事故却连续发生：一月十二日，太原局南张村站，因司机冒进信号（即司机不顾信号阻止而驶车进站），造成列车冲突。一月二十三日，济南局花旗营站，因转辙员搬错道岔，造成列车正面冲突，死伤达六十二人，为铁道部成立以来最严重的恶性事故。二月三日，太原局礼元、侯马间，因工务段违法擅自使用小车，造成列车冲突、机车颠覆、列车全部出轨事故。二月四日，天津局沧县站又因转辙员搬错道岔，造成列车冲突事故。二月七日，衡阳局耒阳站因连结员擅自调动机车，造成列车冲突事故。根据二月七日各局报部事故统计，自一月一日至二月五日止，在全国铁路上，发生重大事故及运转事故计：列车冲突二十件，车辆脱线九十三件，列车分离一百零三件，伤害一百五十七件（车内爆炸一件在内），共计三百七十三件。伤亡八十四人，损坏机车三台，车辆三十一辆。因事故造成列车阻塞的损失尚未统计。这些事故使人民生命和国家财富，蒙受了巨大的损失，这是令人不能容忍的罪过。
    为什么发生这些重大事故呢？
    从连续发生的恶性事故中，可以看出，我们铁路技术管理上的起码的规章已经不存在了。司机任意冒进信号，转辙员搬错道岔，信号不显示就硬拉导线，工务段不经过站长许可就任意使用小车，值班站长不接车，连结员可以自由调动机车。这些违犯规章、破坏纪律的恶劣行为，在我们铁路上还没有受到适时的和应有的制裁。虽然这是沿袭了国民党时代的腐败风气，但我们人民铁路已经有一年到四年的历史，并且这种破坏行为已经给予我们不小的损失。我们有责任及时指出这种腐败风气所形成的破坏行为，是违反人民利益的。
    有些人把事故发生的原因推到线路设备和气候的关系上。线路修复不久，技术装备不完整，气候不良，这是事实。也正因存在这些事实，就更需要在技术管理上提出有效办法，一面加强技术设备，一面明确技术管理规章，以避免事故，绝不能认为技术条件和气候关系，就不可能避免事故。有些人则认为解放后事故虽多，较之过去国民党统治时期却少得多了。把人民管理的铁路，去比敌伪管理的铁路，这种比法是错误的。但是就因为对于事故存在这些错误的看法，反映到我们若干领导干部的思想中，就产生了对于事故麻木不仁、熟视无睹的态度，就助长了国民党时期遗留下来的腐败风气。这就是不断发生重大事故的基本原因。
    正因为铁路技术管理的混乱，正因为某些领导干部的麻痹，就给特务破坏活动，提供了便利条件，给特务破坏以可乘之机。最近几天，所发生的破坏活动，已经发展到极其放肆的地步，如南口劳动英雄被杀害，沈阳北新城子客车爆炸等。这些明目张胆的破坏行为，告诉我们全体工人、职员，我们如果以为可以“高枕无忧”那是为时太早了。
    铁道部鉴于事故的严重，为了提高全路工人、职员的警惕性，消灭重大事故，保证行车安全，特下达紧急命令，具体规定了消灭事故的紧急措施。这是重要的命令，铁路一切机构、一切领导干部和全体工人、职员，必须重视这一命令，根据自己的具体情况，组织起来，展开讨论，定出每一部门、每一个人实行这一命令的办法和步骤，为完全实现这一命令、彻底消灭重大事故而斗争。
    为了保证这一命令的精神能够贯彻下去，我们特着重提出以下几点：
    一、过去所以造成技术管理的混乱作风，乃是国民党腐朽统治的结果，也是广大工人、职员在长时期被压迫之下，消极反抗的表现。但是，今天全体铁路工人、职员已经成为国家和铁路的主人了，铁路一切技术设备，都是我们自己的财产，就必须以最负责的态度来爱护它和管理它。过去那种技术管理上的混乱作风，必须加以改正，绝不应该在工作中，让其仍然保留下去。
    二、必须加强劳动纪律，铁路上的一切规章、一切技术管理规定，是铁路上的法律。遵守规章，遵守技术管理上的一切规定，是所有铁路工人、职员的起码义务。铁路是一个庞大的技术机构，没有章则，没有法规，就一定出乱子。绝不能图省事、碰运气、靠蛮干来办事。一切爱护铁路、爱护国家财产的工人、职员都必须切实遵守铁路上的一切规章，并对于任何破坏规章的行为，作坚决的斗争，以保护国家人民生命财产不受损失。任何在技术管理上的通融、偷懒，都会造成国家的严重损失。
    三、美蒋反动派是注定最后失败了。但它们决不甘心死下去。它们一定要尽一切可能来进行破坏活动。因此全体铁路工人、职员必须提高警惕，严防反革命分子的破坏活动，特别要防止反革命分子利用技术管理上的混乱来进行破坏。因之必须加强一切技术设备的管理，并组织纠察保卫工作，不给反革命分子以可乘之机。
    四、在一切技术部门中讨论这一命令之后，应根据现有的各种技术设备状况和管理规章，拟订具体消灭事故的办法和公约，建立负责制和联合劳动制，展开“安全公里”、“安全期间”的竞赛运动。各级领导机关、政治机关应领导和推动这一运动，使之在全国铁路推行起来，以便在全体工人、职员中，转变劳动态度，肃清那种腐败风气，树立行车安全的思想，树立主人翁爱护人民生命和国家财产的思想。
    最后，我们希望铁道部的命令能够立即在全国铁路工人、职员中贯彻下去，从而使我们的铁路出现一个崭新的面貌。
