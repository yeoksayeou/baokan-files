　　Beijing Municipal Bureau of Education Determines This Year's Education Policy
    Raising the Culture of the Broad Masses and Establishing New Type Worker-Peasant Middle Schools
    [Beijing News] The Beijing Municipal Bureau of Education yesterday (9th) convened a joint meeting of principals, heads of teaching, and heads of general affairs from municipal secondary schools. Deputy Director of the Bureau, Hou Junyan, summarized the work and shortcomings of 1949 and reported on the working principles and plans for municipal secondary schools in 1950. Deputy Director Hou first explained that the general principle of the capital's education work this year is to raise the cultural level of the broad masses of the city, especially the working people. Secondly, on the existing foundation, actively develop and transform technical education schools and normal schools, establish new-type worker-peasant accelerated middle schools, and consolidate and transform secondary education work to improve the cultural and ideological level of young intellectuals.
    Regarding the consolidation and transformation of secondary education, Deputy Director Hou pointed out that the central link is to improve the level of secondary school teachers. Therefore, the primary task of educational administration is to organize and lead the political, theoretical, and professional learning of in-service teachers and staff, so that they can learn to use the Marxist-Leninist position, viewpoints, and methods to carry out teaching work. Second, continue to strengthen the political and ideological education of students, further eliminate the remnants of feudal, comprador, and fascist ideology, and actively cultivate revolutionary ideas of serving the people, new moral viewpoints, and a scientific worldview. The teaching affairs office should conduct political and ideological education in a planned and step-by-step manner through the teaching of various subjects, students' daily life, and various activities. Third, improve administrative leadership, implement the unity of teaching and guidance, strengthen the implementation of the full-time teacher system, and promote demonstration teaching.
    In order to meet the needs of the current production and cultural education construction undertakings, the capital will increase and expand technical education schools and normal schools. To develop and transform technical education, the first step is to expand the Municipal Advanced Industrial and Commercial Schools, and the second is to assist relevant departments in establishing various technical cadre training courses and opening short-term technical training courses. In order to systematically cultivate and improve the teaching staff, the Beijing Normal School will establish a short-term primary school teacher training course.
    In addition, worker-peasant accelerated middle schools will be established to systematically cultivate a large number of worker-peasant cadres.
    The personnel from various municipal middle schools, technical schools, and normal schools attending this meeting will convey Deputy Director Hou's report to the teachers and staff of the city's municipal secondary schools, and will discuss it in conjunction with the summary report of Deputy Minister of Education Qian Junrui at the National Education Work Conference, review the work of 1949, and formulate a work plan for the first half of 1950.

    为适合目前生产与文化教育建设事业的需要，首都将增设和扩充技术教育学校和师范学校。发展与改造技术教育，首先是扩充市立高级工业和商业两校，其次是协助有关部门设立各种技术干部训练班和开设短期技术训练班。为了有计划的培养与提高师资，将由北京师范学校成立短期小学教师训练班。
    此外，并将创立工农速成中学，有计划有步骤的培养大量工农干部。
    出席此次会议的各市立中学、技术学校和师范学校的人员，将对全市市立中等学校教职员传达侯副局长此项报告，并结合中央政府教育部钱俊瑞副部长在全国教育工作会议上的总结报告进行讨论，检讨一九四九年工作，并订出一九五○年上半年工作计划。
