Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 9th -- People from all walks of life in Shanghai have subscribed to over 13 million shares of the Victory Parity Public Bonds, accounting for more than 43% of the first phase's allocated amount of 30 million shares. Since January 29th, hundreds of thousands of workers, students, and people in the arts in the city have held a seven-day promotional week to widely promote and mobilize citizens. As a result of the deepening of the propaganda campaign and the adoption of democratic consultation methods for subscription, promotion branches of industrial sectors such as cotton spinning, dyeing and weaving, cement, and rubber, as well as commercial and financial sectors such as Universal Department Store, silk fabrics, and pedicabs, have successively completed and exceeded their predetermined targets. For example, the cotton spinning industry repeatedly increased its subscriptions during the campaign, with Rong Erren and Rong Yiren brothers representing Shenxin factories increasing their subscriptions from 120,000 shares to 600,000 shares. The industry's original sales target was 2 million shares, but it has now exceeded it by 129,000 shares. Although the business situation of Universal Department Store is relatively poor, it has also completed its original target of 200,000 shares and exceeded it by 600 shares. Other industries such as cigarettes, electrical equipment, and wool spinning, and commercial sectors such as sugar and cotton, are also in the process of increasing subscriptions and competing to purchase. On the workers' side, the total number of purchases and subscriptions has so far reached 2 million shares.
