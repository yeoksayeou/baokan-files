[Our Newspaper's Report] On the second day (February 26th) of the Second Session of the Second Beijing People's Representatives Conference, forty-three representatives spoke, unanimously endorsing Mayor Nie Rongzhen's "Report on the Beijing Municipal People's Government's 1950 Work Plan" and Deputy Mayor Zhang Youyu's "Draft Budget of Revenue and Expenditure for Beijing in 1950." They pledged to ensure the completion of the work plan and offered many suggestions concerning municipal work.

Zeng Zhaolun, representing the Beijing branch of the China Democratic League, praised Beijing's 1950 municipal plan as genuinely serving the working people, fundamentally different from the superficial formalities of the past Kuomintang reactionary government, which only served a few. Regarding Beijing's budget for this year, he believed it fully achieved "taken from the people, used for the people" and even achieved self-sufficiency. In addition, he made many suggestions regarding restoring and developing production, signing collective contracts, retraining workers in declining industries, production in government agencies and schools, land reform in suburban areas, establishing district people's representative conferences, adding technical courses and enriching natural science equipment in middle schools, and establishing science experiment halls in each central district.

Union representatives Yang Kaiwen, Zhu Changjiang, Chou Fangyu, Hu Quangui, Hu Guangjin, Liu Yazhou, Gao Jinduo, Guo Jingyan, and He Fengting, in their speeches, all emphasized that public production should improve planning, implement democratic management, create new records, develop rationalization proposals, sign collective contracts, and launch production competitions. They also called for opening up sales channels for handicrafts.

Farmer representatives Liu Tongen, Wang Jinzhen, Cao Jianrong, and Sun Zhengmin expressed strong support for the government's efforts to vigorously support agricultural production through loans for seeds, fertilizers, etc. They also proposed launching major production competitions between individuals and villages, as well as mutual aid and labor exchange, hoping that the government would reward or publicize labor heroes in newspapers.

Ling Qijun, vice chairman of the Beijing branch of the China Democratic National Construction Association, suggested that private enterprises in Beijing should continue to sign collective contracts to resolve labor-management disputes and increase the production enthusiasm of both parties. He pointed out that industrialists and businessmen should correct the erroneous view of seeking to pay less in taxes (i.e., seeking advantages).

Special invited representatives Professor Fan Hong of Peking University, President Chen Yuan of Fu Jen Catholic University, and Qian Sanqiang pointed out in their speeches that the government is truly the people's own government. The government's work plan stipulates that the central tasks are to restore and develop production, transform the city from a consumer city to a production city, consolidate revolutionary order, and carry out municipal construction with a focus. These plans represent the opinions of the masses of the people and serve the working people. Every citizen should make the greatest effort to overcome all difficulties and ensure the completion of this plan.

Women representatives Hu Yizai, Wu Manhua, Zeng Zhaoyi, Liu Qingyang, and Wang Yunyin said that the 1950 municipal work plan, whether in terms of production, culture, education, or maternal and child health, attaches great importance to and cares for women. For example, in the development of public enterprise production, three of the four factories planned to be added can absorb female workers. In terms of cultural and educational construction, a large number of poor children are admitted to schools, and the development of nurseries will make many mothers happy and supportive. Women now account for about half of the adult literacy education that has been established, and prostitutes have been liberated. We women workers must assist the government in completing this year's work tasks.

Student representative Gu Qizong and the representative of the Middle and Primary School Teachers Union, Xu Chubo, unanimously believed that the spirit of the 1950 work plan and budget is always centered on serving the people, especially the working people. They also expressed their intention to call on students to participate in voluntary labor and practice strict economy.

Industrial and commercial representatives Fu Huating, Zhao Yizhi, Zhang Xianting, Hou Rulin, and Zuo Guangyu believed that this year's government plan to support private industry and commerce is a big step forward compared to 1949, and that attention should be paid to gradually shifting commercial capital to industrial capital in the future. They also stated that the industrial and commercial sectors would unconditionally accept tax tasks and assist the government in ensuring smooth completion.

Representatives of ethnic minorities and religious circles, Yang Mingde, Yang Yisan, and Zhang Qinggui, said that ethnic minorities and religious circles are willing to devote all their strength to help the government complete various tasks. Bo Yindeligeer Lama said that he would call on the Mongolian people in Beijing to unite and complete the government's work plan.

Hu Yuanling, a representative of the university teachers' union, said that in 1950, the vigorous restoration and development of production, culture, education, health, and municipal construction must revolve around production construction. The focus of cultural and educational work should be on vocational education, social education, and teacher training in order to improve the culture of the working people and cultivate intellectual workers and the talents needed for production and construction.

Medical worker representative Li Keng said that medical workers especially felt the thoroughness of the government's 1950 plan, which was completely based on the interests of the working masses. In addition to vigorously engaging in preventive work, medical workers will also open clinics and health centers in the outer city and suburban areas to provide free and reduced-fee treatment for the working people. He also suggested establishing mobile medical vehicles, promoting the establishment of nurseries and kindergartens, and unifying the training of childcare workers.

Literary and art representative Lian Kuoru said that literary and art workers should do a good job in popularizing culture and develop mass literature and art in the future. They should also organize tours to factories and rural areas.

Zhang Yunchuan, director of the Beijing Party Affairs Consolidation Committee of the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party, proposed to fully implement Beijing's agricultural production plan in order to solve the problem of food and vegetables in Beijing.

Youth representative Li Shumin said: We have already achieved good results in improving quality, increasing output, and reducing costs in areas such as clothing factories and machine factories. We must further study technology, create new records, and complete the task of vigorous production in 1950. In terms of learning, we must improve our political and cultural level, work hard to learn technology, and strive to become young workers with high cultural and technical skills.

Xu Baokui of the Standing Committee of the Beijing Branch of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang spoke about the issue of promoting People's Victory Inflation-Adjusted Public Bonds, hoping that all sectors would strive to overfulfill the target.

Kang Laotaitai, a representative of the families of martyrs, said: My husband was killed by the Kuomintang reactionaries. The Communist Party has brought me boundless benefits in the year since liberation, and I will never forget it in my life. Today I fully agree with and support the reports of Mayor Nie and Deputy Mayor Zhang. She shouted: "Long live the Chinese Communist Party!" "Long live Chairman Mao!"

Luo Wenfang, a representative of the Public Security Corps, said: In 1950, in addition to continuing to consolidate revolutionary order and protect production and construction, the Public Security Corps will further improve itself. He represented the Public Security Corps in guaranteeing strict economy, vigorously participating in labor production, and never exceeding the government's budget by even a grain of rice.

Special invited representative Le Songsheng said: Many local figures have now actively and enthusiastically purchased public bonds. We are mobilizing and persuading the remaining local figures with strength to purchase them. There are difficulties, but we are working hard to overcome them. We hope that all representatives will assist in this work to ensure the completion of this glorious and arduous task before March 15.
