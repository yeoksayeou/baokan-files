　　[Our Newspaper] Following "The Nine-Tailed Fox," the Zaiwen Troupe, led by Xiao Baiyushuang, is currently rushing to stage another new Ping opera, "The Pomegranate Skirt." The theme of the play is to reflect the collusion between feudal Taoist sects and the landlord class in oppressing peasants, leading the middle peasant Zhang Tiecheng to ruin. The play is being co-directed by Li Su of the Literature and Art Department's Opera Improvement Section and Zhang Yongjin of the troupe. It is scheduled to premiere in Beijing on the eighth of this month and will participate in the Spring Festival competition performances.
