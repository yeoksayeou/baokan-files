　　The Yutai Supply and Marketing Cooperative on the Disaster Relief Front
　　Wen Miao, Shi Hong
　　This year's flood in Yutai County (belonging to Pingyuan Province) is even more severe than in previous years.
　　Here, the terrain is flat, bordering the Yellow River to the northwest and Nanyang Lake to the east. Therefore, whenever the rainy season comes, it is a vast expanse of water, indistinguishable between river and land, and the people's lives are extremely painful. Although there is a foundation for handicrafts and sideline occupations locally, there is a lack of active leadership, which has left many disaster victims unable to produce. Even the finished products that are produced are difficult to transport to distant places for sale. Therefore, the rush mat industry has completely stagnated at that time. The reed mat weaving industry has also seen a sharp drop in the daily output of mats from 10,000 to 5,000 due to private merchants vigorously lowering the price of mats, coupled with price fluctuations.
　　With the sharp decline in mat production, the sales of lake reeds also became a problem. As a result, the lives of the lake residents who rely on cutting lake reeds and those who rely on transporting mats and reeds have been greatly affected. At the same time, because local products cannot be sold in large quantities to other places to exchange for grain, this has further driven up grain prices, and many people have lost their purchasing power. Therefore, people are discussing each other: "The more we produce, the less we have! Let's not produce, let's flee the famine!" In this situation, people's hearts were unstable, order was chaotic, and the broad masses fled one after another.
　　Faced with this severe famine, should the solution to the masses' production and living materials rely on simple loans and relief, or should we support disaster victims' production in many ways? At that time, some cadres in Yutai County held the former idea, mistakenly believing that in such a severe disaster area, unless a large amount of loans and relief were provided, it would be impossible to help the masses overcome the famine. However, after the establishment of the Yutai Supply and Marketing Cooperative (October 10), it immediately criticized this simple relief view and loudly put forward the policy of self-reliance through production.
　　The largest production in Yutai Lake is lake reeds and firewood (dwarf rotten reeds, etc.), followed by fish (small output, easy to sell). The masses in the sixth and seventh districts and some villages in other districts often engage in weaving reed mats as a sideline. The masses in some villages in the third district are accustomed to textile production. Near the old city, cattails are produced, and the masses in thirty natural villages mostly make rush bags. In addition, many people in the county rely on transporting manure, lake reeds, firewood, mats, etc. for a living.
　　Based on this practical situation investigation and combined with the needs of cities and other regions, the Supply and Marketing Cooperative formulated its own business plan. After analyzing the interrelationships between these productions, it decided to start with supporting reed mat production as a priority.
　　The specific methods are: on the one hand, lend 6,000 jin of grain to the mat weavers to mobilize them to buy raw materials in the lake; on the other hand, actively organize the lake residents to cut lake reeds in large quantities; and purchase 4,000 good reeds and 10,000 dwarf rotten lake reeds with grain, then organize the disaster victims to transport them back, lend the good reeds to the mat weavers for production, and lend the bad reeds to the masses as capital (to be repaid in three months), and transport them to Jinxiang and other places to exchange for grain. At the same time, the acquired mats are organized to be transported to Xuzhou, Shanxian, Dingtao, Jinxiang, Juye, and other places to exchange for grain, bean cakes, and daily necessities. During this period, a batch of rush bags were also purchased and transported to Jinan, which immediately restored the rush bag industry in thirty villages. In this way, the cattails in the old city have changed from being unwanted to being snatched up even without going out.
　　Through this organized and planned operation, the difficulties in the masses' production and living materials were naturally resolved. For example, transporting mats to Shanxian and bringing back grain, the round trip of five days can earn wages of 45 to 50 jin of rice (a total of 120 li, with 2 li of wage rice per 100 jin per li, and each person can push at least 300 jin). In this way, the difficulties of local reed and mat sales and grain shortage are organically solved at the same time. Therefore, in many villages, men transport, and women, the elderly, and the weak weave mats and rush bags, and children in their teens collect firewood and pick up manure, achieving that there is no idle person in the whole village, forming a truly "men and women work together, actively produce to overcome the famine" mass upsurge.
　　This measure of the Supply and Marketing Cooperative has basically stabilized the pessimistic and despairing emotions of the masses in the face of the disaster and the chaotic phenomenon of fleeing one after another, and greatly enhanced the confidence of the broad masses in self-reliance through production. After the Dahebei Village Cooperative purchased reed mats from its members at a price of 2.2 liang of millet per mat (the cost of each mat is at most 1 jin of millet), the masses said: "This is a way out, let's produce, let's not flee the famine!" From here, the phenomenon of fleeing the famine quickly stopped in the sixth and seventh districts. Those who had fled also returned home to join the cooperative for production. After production started in Guting Town, 300 households who had planned to flee did not leave a single one. 80 households who had fled before also returned. 11 households in Danlou fled to the south of the Longhai Railway. Hearing that there was a way out for making mats, the men immediately returned to participate in the cooperative, and then called back all the women to produce. In some villages in the fourth and fifth districts that can weave mats, they also actively joined the reed mat production and abandoned their preparations to flee. Therefore, the output of mats has increased day by day, and has now increased from 5,000 to 20,000.
　　From the establishment of the cooperative to the end of December, they purchased a total of 70,000 reed mats, 20,000 rush bags, 4,000 reeds, and 15,000 dwarf rotten reeds from the members, and organized 500 carts for transportation, and have now earned 120,000 jin of grain. At the same time, they also transferred back 115,000 jin of wheat, 100,000 jin of miscellaneous grains, 20,000 jin of bean cakes, 24,000 jin of salt, 300 jin of kerosene, and a part of daily necessities such as matches. In organizing the supply and marketing business, they also established ten village cooperatives and developed 4,000 members.
　　Establishing cooperatives in disaster areas is different from general areas. Although the broad masses of disaster victims know the benefits of joining the cooperative from their own practical experience, they suffer from the lack of capital to invest, especially the poor peasants, most of whom produce one day and eat one day, and some even have no production capital and cannot eat even two liang of grain per person per day. In response to this situation, the Yutai County Supply and Marketing Cooperative handled this issue very flexibly. For those who have the means of production, they absorb different products (such as mats and rush bags) as shares according to different productions. For those who lack the means of production, they first lend capital, and then collect their products as shares. For those who lack the means of living, they lend capital and allow them to pay in installments on a regular basis. For example, among the existing 4,000 members, as many as 1,000 are paying in installments on a regular basis. Experience has proven that this measure is very necessary in areas with severe disasters. This not only expands the foundation of the cooperative, but also ensures the smooth implementation of its own supply and marketing plan. Otherwise, it will become detached from the masses.
　　Therefore, in three months, they gained an important experience. That is, business operations must be based on the different production conditions of the local area, combined with the needs of cities and other regions, to formulate their own business plans and purposefully support the masses. In this way, not only can the blindness of production be overcome, and a series of difficulties in the masses' production and life can be solved, but also it is easy to carry out one's own business without losing money. This is an important part of developing cooperative undertakings in disaster areas.
　　However, there is still a problem that needs to be solved urgently. That is the relationship with the state-owned economy. In carrying out production and disaster relief, the cooperative must actively contact the National Bank, trade organizations, and state-owned stores to seek their assistance. Only in this way can the disaster relief work play a greater role. However, the Yutai County Cooperative has failed to do so, so the acquired reed mats are only 8% of the actual output (calculated at an average daily output of 10,000). If this continues to develop, the reed mat industry that has been supported will inevitably affect the lives of the broad masses of disaster victims due to the inability to purchase them.
　　In addition, the issue of cadres and accountants in the district cooperative also needs to be resolved quickly, because it has already affected the development of supply and marketing business.

　　在救灾线上的鱼台供销社
　　文渺·史洪
    今年鱼台县（平原属）的水灾，比以往几年都更加厉害。
    这里，地势平坦，西北临黄河，东临南阳湖，所以每当雨季，一片汪洋，河地不分，人民生活痛苦异常。当地虽有手工业副业基础，惟缺乏积极领导，致不少灾民无法生产。即生产出的成品，亦难运至远地推销，故蒲包业在当时已完全停顿。而编席业，亦因私商大力压低席价，再加物价波动，每日席产很快由一万领降至五千领。
    随着席产锐减，湖苇销路亦成了问题，因此依靠割湖苇的湖民与依靠运输席苇为生的人，生活受到极大影响。同时，因当地产品不能大量外销换回粮食，就更促使粮价上涨，不少人失去购买能力。所以人们都相互议论：“越生产越没有啦！别生产啦，逃荒吧！”在此情况下，人心浮动，秩序混乱，广大群众纷纷外逃。
    在这严重的灾荒面前，对群众生产生活资料的解决，是依靠单纯的贷款救济呢？还是多方面扶植灾民生产呢？在当时鱼台县的一部分干部中，是存在着前一种思想的，错误的认为在这样严重的灾区，除非大量的贷款与救济，便无法帮助群众渡过灾荒。但在鱼台供销社成立（十月十日）后，当即批判了这种单纯救济观点，响亮的提出生产自救的方针。
    鱼台湖里最大量的生产是湖苇、柴草（矮烂苇等），其次是鱼（产量不大，销售不难），六、七两区和其它区部分村庄群众，即经常以编苇席为副业。三区一部分村庄群众习惯纺织生产。旧城附近产蒲子，有三十个自然村群众大部做蒲包。另外，全县有不少群众依靠运输大粪、湖苇、柴草、席子等为生。
    供销社根据这一实际情况的调查，结合城市及其它地区需要，便制订了自己的经营计划。并经过对这些生产相互关系的分析，确定了首先有重点的从扶植苇席作起。
    具体作法是：一面向席民贷粮六千斤，动员席民到湖里购买原料；一面又积极主动的组织湖民大量割湖苇；并以粮食购买好苇四千个、矮烂湖苇一万个，然后组织灾民运回，将好苇贷给席民生产，坏苇则借给群众作本（分三个月还清），运往金乡等地交换粮食。同时将收购的席子，组织灾民分别运往徐州、单县、定陶、金乡、巨野等地，换回粮食、豆饼与日用品。在此期间，并收购蒲包一部运往济南，使三十个村的蒲包业马上得以恢复。这样一来，旧城的蒲子便由无人要变成了不出门也有人抢着买了。
    通过这一有组织有计划的经营，群众生产生活资料的困难，很自然的得到了解决。如往单县运席子，回来推粮食，来回五天可赚工资米四十五斤至五十斤（共一百二十里，一百斤每里工资米二两，每人最少能推三百斤），这样，就同时有机的解决了当地苇、席销路与粮食缺乏的困难。因之，有很多村庄，男人运输，妇女老弱打席编蒲包，十来岁的小孩打柴拾粪，做到了全村没闲人，形成真正“男女齐动手、积极生产渡灾荒”的群众热潮。
    供销社这种措施，基本上稳定了群众在灾荒面前的悲观失望情绪，与纷纷外逃的混乱现象，而大大提高了广大群众生产自救的信心。大河北村合作社，以每领席二斤二两小米的价格（每领席成本最大一斤小米）收购社员苇席后，群众说：“这可有门路了，生产吧，别逃荒啦！”从这里开始，六、七区很快便停止了逃荒现象。已逃走者亦纷纷回家入社生产。谷亭镇在搞起生产后，曾准备逃荒的三百户，结果一户也未走。以前逃走的亦回来八十户。单楼有十一户逃往陇海路南，听说打席有了出路，男的马上回来参加合作社，接着把妇女也全部叫回生产。在四、五区一部分会打席的村庄，也积极的卷入苇席生产，而放弃外逃准备。因此，席产量日增，现已由五千领增为二万领。
    从建社至十二月底，他们共收购社员苇席七万领、蒲包二万个、苇子四千个、矮烂苇一万五千个，并组织了五百辆小车进行运输，现已赚粮十二万斤。同时还调剂回麦子十一万五千斤、杂粮十万斤、豆饼两万斤、盐二万四千斤、煤油三百斤及火柴等日用品一部。在组织供销业务中，并建立村社十个，发展社员四千名。
    灾区建社是不同于一般地区的。虽广大灾民从自己实际体验中知道入社的好处，但苦于无本入股，特别是贫农，大部是搞一天生产吃一天饭，甚至有的毫无生产资本，每日一人吃不到二两粮。针对这一情况，鱼台县供销社很灵活的处理了这一问题。他们对有生产资料的，根据不同的生产，吸收不同的生产品（如席、蒲包）为股金。对缺乏生产资料的，则先贷给资本，然后收他的生产品为股金。对缺乏生活资料的，即贷给资本，准其定期缓交，如现有四千个社员中，定期缓交者即达一千人。经验证明，这种措施在灾荒严重的地区是十分必要的。这不仅可扩大社的基础，且能保证自己供销计划的顺利进行。反之，则会脱离群众。
    因此，他们在三个月中，就获得一条重要的体验。即经营业务，必须根据当地不同的生产情况，结合城市与其它地区的需要，制订自己的经营计划，有目的地扶持群众。这样，既可克服生产的盲目性，且解决一连串的群众生产生活的困难，又便于自己开展业务而不致亏本。这即是开展灾区合作事业的重要一环。
    但目前还有一个问题急需解决。就是与国营经济的关系问题。在开展生产救灾上，合作社必须主动的联系国家银行、贸易机关和公营商店，以争取其援助。只有这样，才能使救灾工作发挥更大的作用。但鱼台县社未能这样作，因此所收购的苇席，不过实产量的百分之八（以平均日产万领计）。如此发展下去，所扶植起来的席业，将来就难免因无力收购而影响广大灾民生活。
    除此，区社的干部与会计问题，也需要很快解决，因为现已影响到供销业务的开展。
