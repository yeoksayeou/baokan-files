Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 16th: TASS, New York, 15th: American newspapers indicate that Japan has been assigned a prominent position in the American invasion plan. From American newspaper reports, it can be judged that the main purpose of the trip to Japan by the American Chiefs of Staff, led by Bradley, is to turn Japan into a permanent military base for the United States. U.S. News & World Report magazine states that the chiefs of staff, who returned to Washington on the 12th, brought back a plan from Japan to ensure that the United States obtains permanent bases in Japan. The magazine points out that the Yokosuka naval base already accommodates American warships. The U.S. Air Force currently has more than ten air bases in Japan, and the United States intends to permanently occupy at least four of them. The magazine also points out that the Yoshida government is willing to supply these bases to the United States.
