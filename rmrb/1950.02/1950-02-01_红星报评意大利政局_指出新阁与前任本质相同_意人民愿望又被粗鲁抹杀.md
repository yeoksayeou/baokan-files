Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, January 31st: TASS Moscow reports: A Red Star newspaper observer commented on the Italian political situation, stating: The government crisis lasted for more than two weeks, and came to an end on the 27th with the formation of a new cabinet by De Gasperi. The new cabinet's personnel are essentially no different from the previous cabinet. De Gasperi had hoped to "reorganize" his cabinet painlessly without going through a formal resignation, but this was not achieved, and the cabinet was forced to resign.

　　The government crisis was the result of widespread dissatisfaction among the masses with the policies of the Italian government. The government failed to fulfill any of its promises and did not implement the reforms stipulated in the constitution. Due to the Marshallization of the country by Italian reactionaries, Italy's economic situation is deteriorating. Reducing domestic production to benefit American exporters has resulted in increased unemployment. At the end of last year and the beginning of this year, two million people nationwide were completely unemployed, and two million people were partially unemployed. The poverty of workers who have not yet lost their jobs has also become drastically more serious. The national birth rate has decreased significantly, while the death rate has increased sharply.

　　The bloodshed in Modena brought the people's indignation to the point of unbearable endurance. Bloody Monday—January 9, 1950—blatantly demonstrated to the Italian working people the true meaning of the policies pursued by the Italian ruling clique: selling out the nation, starvation, and terror. It is enough to point out that in less than eighteen months, forty-one unarmed workers and peasants were killed, and three hundred were injured. Therefore, it is not surprising that De Gasperi preferred to submit the resignation of his cabinet to avoid participating in the parliamentary debate on the Modena bloodshed incident.

　　The selection of the "new" cabinet shows that the Christian Democratic Party has crudely ignored the wishes of the Italian people for the formation of a democratic government, and shows that the Italian ruling clique does not intend to change the policies of the previous government.

　　The Italian working people oppose the conspiracies of the reactionaries. The Communist Party demands a thorough change in domestic, foreign, and social policies. The Communist Party demands respect for all civil rights recognized by the constitution, guarantees of personal inviolability, and, above all, the inviolability of the working people fighting for bread and work.

### 红星报评意大利政局  指出新阁与前任本质相同  意人民愿望又被粗鲁抹杀

　　红星报评意大利政局
    指出新阁与前任本质相同
    意人民愿望又被粗鲁抹杀
    【新华社北京三十一日电】塔斯社莫斯科讯：红星报观察家评论意大利的政局称：政府危机延长了两周余，到二十七日加斯贝利组成新阁告一段落。新阁人选与前一内阁本质上没有分别。加斯贝利曾希望不经过正式辞职而毫无痛苦地“改组”他的内阁，但这点却没有办到，内阁曾被迫辞职了。
    政府危机是群众对意大利政府的政策广泛不满的结果。政府未能实现它的任何诺言，也未实行宪法所规定的改革。由于意大利反动派把国家马歇尔化，意大利的经济局势日益恶化。减少本国生产以利美国出口商，结果使失业增加。去年年底今年年初，全国有二百万人完全失业，二百万人部分失业。迄今还没有失去工作的工人，其贫穷也急剧地严重化了。国内人口出生率大减，而死亡率则大增。
    摩登纳的流血，使人民的义愤到了忍无可忍的程度。血的星期一——一九五○年一月九日，向意大利劳动人民赤裸裸地表明了：意大利统治集团所奉行的政策——出卖民族、饥饿和恐怖政策的真实含义。单只提出这样一点就够了：在不足十八个月的时间中，竟有四十一个手无寸铁的工人农民被杀，三百人受伤。因此，加斯贝利宁可提出其内阁的辞职，以避免参加议会中关于摩登纳流血事件的讨论，是并不足奇的。
    “新”阁的人选表明，基督教民主党粗鲁地抹杀了要求组成民主政府的意大利人民的愿望，表明意大利统治集团不打算改变前政府的政策。
    意大利劳动人民反对反动派的阴谋。共产党要求彻底改变内政、外交和社会政策。共产党要求尊重宪法所承认的一切公民权利，保证人身的不受侵犯，首先是为面包和工作而战斗的劳苦人民的不受侵犯。
