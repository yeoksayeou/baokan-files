　　Introduction to "Assembly Line Production Method"
    Question: In the People's Daily, December 22, 1949, third edition, an article titled "Welcoming a New Upsurge in Economic Construction, Hundreds of Thousands of Workers in Northeast Mines and Factories Create Thousands of New Production Records" mentions that the Huanggu Tun Vehicle Factory hired Soviet technician, Comrade Steford, who introduced the Soviet advanced enterprise management method – the assembly line production method. Now I have a few questions that I would like you to answer:
    1. What is the assembly line production method?
    2. What kind of enterprises is the assembly line production method suitable for?
    3. Are there any Chinese reference books that introduce the assembly line production method?
        Ding Yan, Fifteenth Ordnance Factory, Taiyuan
    Answer:
    1. Assembly line production method is a translated term. It means a continuous, uninterrupted method of operation, like flowing water. Based on the nature of the work, a plan is drafted, and a chart is created; the work is carried out step-by-step according to the chart. After a certain period, each workpiece is moved from one workstation to another for sequential processing or assembly. The number of workstations should be determined by the complexity of the workpiece. The chart should consider not only the supply time and assembly time of each part, but also the time required for processing.
    Each workstation should be equipped with the appropriate number of people as needed, so as to ensure that they can work in parallel simultaneously as much as possible. This can reduce the stagnation of parts during work. Because the assembly line production method is a highly scientific division of labor. The work is simple, and workers can easily become skilled; the work is regular, and the output increases accordingly.
    Each workstation should ensure the supply of materials and tools. On-site material rooms and tool rooms are best located near the workstation.
    Each workstation has inspectors to conduct intermediate inspections. If defects occur, they can be corrected immediately, thus improving quality.
    2. The assembly line production method is suitable for any production enterprise. The more products there are, and the more complex the work is, the more effective it becomes.
    3. Chinese books about assembly line production have not yet been seen. If you want to learn more, you can contact our factory in advance to arrange a visit.

### 介绍“流水作业法”

　　介绍“流水作业法”
    问：人民日报一九四九年十二月二十二日三版，“迎接经济建设新高潮，东北各矿厂数十万工人创造千百种生产新纪录”一文中，谈到皇姑屯车辆工厂聘请苏联技师史德福，介绍了苏联先进的企业管理方法——流水作业法。现在我有几个问题，请你们答复：
    一、什么是流水作业法？
    二、流水作业法适用于那一类企业？
    三、有没有介绍流水作业法的中文参考书？
        太原十五兵工厂丁炎
    答：
    一、流水作业法是译名。意思是像流水式的连续不断的作业方法。根据工作性质，拟定计划，制出图表；依照图表，有步骤地进行工作。各项工作物，经一定的时间，由一作业场移向另一作业场，次第加工或装配。作业场的多少，应视工作物的繁简而决定。图表之制定，不仅应考虑到各部分品供给时间及装配时间，而且要考虑到加工过程中所需的时间。
    每个作业场按需要配置适当的人数，尽量使其同时平行工作，这样可以减少部分品在工作中的停滞。因为流水作业法是高度的科学分工。工作单纯，工人技术易于熟练；工作有规律，产量随之提高。
    每个作业场，应保证材料及工具的供应。现场材料室工具室，最好设于作业场附近。
    每个作业场有检查员进行中间检查。发生缺陷，可立时纠正，故能提高品质。
    二、流水作业法适用于任何生产企业中。产品数量愈多，工作愈复杂，就愈有效。
    三、关于流水作业的中文书籍，尚未见到。如欲详细了解，可向本厂事先接洽来参观。
