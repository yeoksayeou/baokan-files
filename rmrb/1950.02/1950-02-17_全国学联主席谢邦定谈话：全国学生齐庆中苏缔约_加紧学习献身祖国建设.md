　　Chairman of the All-China Students' Federation, Xie Bangding, Speaks:
    Students Nationwide Celebrate the Sino-Soviet Treaty
    Intensify Studies to Dedicate Themselves to National Construction
    【Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 16th】Xie Bangding, Chairman of the All-China Students' Federation, recently issued a statement regarding the signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance, and Mutual Assistance and other agreements, saying:

    We, the students of all of China, with boundless joy, warmly celebrate the signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance, and Mutual Assistance and the two agreements. The signing of these treaties and agreements shattered the schemes of American imperialism and the Japanese reactionary clique it supports to invade our country. It gives us powerful assistance in national defense and economic construction, and at the same time provides a reliable guarantee for peace in the East and throughout the world. We deeply thank Marshal Stalin and Chairman Mao for ushering in a new era of permanent cooperation between the Chinese and Soviet peoples. We will always be under their leadership and guidance, full of confidence to build our new country and a happy and prosperous life. At the same time, we will work together with the youth and people of the world to defend lasting world peace and strive for a bright future for youth.

    In the past struggle against American Chiang Kai-shek, we Chinese students clearly recognized that the Soviet Union is the most loyal friend of the Chinese people. However, due to the long-term malicious propaganda of American imperialism and the Kuomintang reactionaries, some of our classmates still have some incorrect views about the Soviet Union. Today, ironclad facts shatter the rumors of the reactionaries and once again prove the sincere friendship of the Soviet Union towards us. We should strengthen the study of internationalism based on the content of these treaties and agreements and the unbreakable friendship between the Chinese and Soviet peoples, thoroughly eliminate narrow-minded nationalism, and at the same time, we should intensify our efforts to study the knowledge necessary for building a new democratic country, and prepare to dedicate ourselves to the great construction cause of the motherland.

　　全国学联主席谢邦定谈话：
    全国学生齐庆中苏缔约 
    加紧学习献身祖国建设
    【新华社北京十六日电】中华全国学联主席谢邦定顷就中苏友好同盟互助条约及其他协定的签订发表谈话说：
    我们全中国的学生以无限欢欣的心情热烈庆祝中苏两国友好同盟互助条约和两个协定的签订。这些条约和协定的签订，粉碎了美帝国主义和它扶植下的日本反动集团企图侵略我国的阴谋，它使我们在国防上和经济建设上得到了有力的援助，同时使东方以及全世界的和平得到了可靠的保障。我们深深感谢斯大林大元帅和毛主席给我们揭开了中苏人民永久合作的新时代，我们将永远在他们领导和培育之下充满信心来建设我们新国家和幸福美好的生活，同时和全世界青年和人民一起，为保卫世界持久和平、争取青年的美好将来而斗争。
    我们中国学生在过去反对美蒋的斗争中，早就清楚地认识了苏联是我们中国人民最忠实的朋友，但由于美帝国主义和国民党反动派长期恶毒宣传的影响，在我们一些同学中，还存在着一些对苏联不正确的看法。今天铁一般的事实粉碎了反动派的谣言，又一次证明了苏联对我们真挚的友谊。我们应该根据这些条约和协定的内容和中苏两国人民牢不可破的友谊来加强国际主义的学习，彻底肃清狭隘民族主义的思想，同时还应该加紧努力学习各种建设新民主主义国家所必需的知识，准备献身于祖国的伟大建设事业。
