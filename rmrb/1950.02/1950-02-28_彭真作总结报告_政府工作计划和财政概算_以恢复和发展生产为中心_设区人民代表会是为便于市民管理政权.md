    Chairman Peng Zhen made a summary report to the congress in the afternoon. He explained the relevant principles, guidelines, and ideological issues in the 1950 plan and budget of the Beijing Municipal People's Government. He said: Our work plan and budget are fundamentally different from those of the Kuomintang and all other reactionary rulers. The plan and budget of the Kuomintang reactionary group was a plan and budget dedicated to squeezing others, harming people's lives, destroying production, plundering, extorting, and scraping the land. Our plan and budget is centered on restoring and developing production, and our municipal construction and education serve production. In terms of finance, the revenue and expenditure of our municipal government is open to the people's representatives and decided by the people's representatives, because the income of our people and public enterprises is entirely used for the people's cause. Regarding the establishment of district people's representative conferences, it is for the purpose of more broadly contacting citizens, concentrating opinions, implementing the government's work plans, discussing the welfare, public health, and municipal construction of the district, assisting the government in consolidating revolutionary order, and facilitating citizens' management of political power and supervising the work of various staff members, facilitating criticism and self-criticism, and therefore it is necessary to establish district people's representative conferences. Finally, he called on new and old cadres, Party and non-Party cadres to cooperate closely and unite the people of the city to complete the task.
    After Comrade Peng Zhen's report, trade union representatives Hu Guangjin, Zheng Guozhu, and Liu Fuyun, minority representatives Yang Yisan and Zhang Qinggui, industrial and commercial representative Zuo Guangyu, women's representative Qian Lingjuan, representatives from the Primary and Secondary Education Union Han Huantang and Zhang Lianyun (female), and student representatives Zhou Jiyu (female) and Wu Duzhou spoke successively, expressing their warm support for Chairman Peng Zhen's summary report, believing that it pointed out a clear direction for Beijing's future work. They must thoroughly convey the spirit and resolutions of the congress after the meeting, unite the people of all strata, and ensure the completion of this year's central task.
    Trade union representative Hu Guangjin said: "Mayor Nie's report and Comrade Peng Zhen's summary clearly pointed out the direction of this year's work and told us how to move towards this direction. We must do a good job in production and ensure the completion of this year's central task."
    Minority representative Yang Yisan said: "Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, our Hui people are truly equal. This year's central task is production, and we should enthusiastically throw ourselves into production. The government's literacy classes are really great, and I have learned a lot of characters. After I go back, I must convey the spirit and resolutions of the congress well."
    Women's representative Qian Lingjuan said: "Just now Comrade Peng Zhen mentioned the importance of the district people's representative conference, and I really felt it. I have participated in several meetings of the 15th police station of the Sixth District, and many problems were solved at the meetings. This proves that the district representative conference is a bridge between the masses and the municipal government. If it is done well, it will make the municipal representative conference play a greater role."
    Student representative Zhou Jiyu said: "After listening to Comrade Peng Zhen's summary report, I clearly realized that the task of our students is to study and produce. Doing a good job in production can help the government solve financial difficulties, reduce the burden on the people, and also improve our lives, which is of great help to doing a good job in study. This year, we must actively participate in production and study hard."
    Finally, the presidium publicly elected Xu Deheng to deliver the closing address. He first said: Since the liberation of Beijing, we have held three people's representative conferences from all walks of life. We are honored to study the people's democratic dictatorship under the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Chinese Communist Party. We have learned a lot in the three conferences. This people's representative conference from all walks of life has made new progress compared with the previous two. After listening to the reports of Mayor Nie and Deputy Mayor Zhang, the representatives have a deeper understanding that the people's government is reasonable and prudent in taking from the people and using it for the people in a planned and focused manner. He said: "The task before us now is to work hard to restore and develop production and support the front. We must convey the spirit of the conference to the two million citizens of the city so that they can use their strength to complete the 1950 work plan of the municipal government."

　　彭真作总结报告
    政府工作计划和财政概算  以恢复和发展生产为中心
    设区人民代表会是为便于市民管理政权
    各界代表发言
    会后定要深入传达决议  保证完成今年中心任务
    许德珩致闭幕词
    彭真主席于下午向大会作总结报告。他说明北京市人民政府一九五○年计划和财政概算中有关的原则、方针和思想问题。他说：我们的工作计划和财政概算和国民党及其他一切反动统治者是根本不同的。国民党反动集团的计划和概算，是专靠榨取别人、危害人民生活、破坏生产、抢掠勒索、刮地皮的计划和概算；我们的计划和概算，是以恢复和发展生产为中心，我们的市政建设和教育是为生产服务的。在财政方面，我们市政府的财政收支是向人民代表公开，并由人民代表会决定的，因为我们人民及公营事业的收入都全部用之于人民事业上。关于区人民代表会议的建立，是为了更广泛的联系市民，集中意见，实现政府各项工作计划，为了讨论本区福利、公共卫生、市政建设和协助政府巩固革命秩序，且便于市民管理政权，并监督各种工作人员的工作，便于进行工作的批评和自我批评，因此有设立区人民代表会的必要。最后，他号召新老干部、党与非党干部必须密切合作，团结全市人民完成任务。
    彭真同志报告之后，工会代表胡光锦、郑国柱、刘富云，少数民族代表杨益三、张清贵，工商业代表左广玉，妇女代表钱令娟，中小教联代表韩焕堂、张廉云（女），学生代表周基裕（女）、吴笃周等先后发言，对彭真主席的总结报告表示热烈的拥护，认为给北京市今后的工作指出了一个明确的方向，一定要在会后深入传达大会的精神和决议，团结各阶层人民，保证完成今年的中心任务。
    工会代表胡光锦说：“聂市长的报告和彭真同志的总结，清楚地指出了今年的工作方向，并告诉我们怎样朝着这个方向前进，我们一定要把生产搞好，保证完成今年的中心任务”。
    少数民族代表杨益三说：“我们回民在中国共产党的领导下，真正的平等了，今年的中心任务是生产，我们应该热烈投到生产方面去。政府举办识字班真太好了，我认识了不少字。我回去后一定要好好传达大会的精神和决议”。
    妇女代表钱令娟说：“刚才彭真同志提到区人民代表会议的重要，我实在感觉到了。我曾经参加过六区十五派出所几次会议，在会议上便解决了许多问题，由此证明，区代表会是群众与市政府的桥梁，做得好，会使市代表会议起更大的作用”。
    学生代表周基裕说：“我听了彭真同志的总结报告，很明确地认识了我们学生的任务就是学习和生产，把生产搞好，可以帮助政府解决财政的困难，减轻人民的负担，也可以改善我们的生活，对搞好学习也有很大的帮助，我们今年一定要积极参加生产，努力学习”。
    最后主席团公推许德珩致闭幕词，他首先说：北京解放后一年来我们已经开过三次各界人民代表会议，我们光荣地在毛主席和中国共产党领导下学习人民民主专政，在三次会议中我们已经学习了很多东西。这次各界人民代表会议比前两次有了新的进步，各代表听了聂市长和张副市长的报告，更深刻地体会到人民政府是合理的慎重的取之于民，有计划有重点的用之于民。他说：“摆在我们目前的任务是要努力恢复发展生产，支援前线。我们要把会议精神传达给全市二百万市民，使他们拿出力量来完成市政府一九五○年的工作计划。”
