　　TASS, Sofia, February 23rd: The Bulgarian Government Information Office recently issued a statement saying that the US Minister to Sofia, Donald Heath, acted in a manner incompatible with his diplomatic position, seriously interfering in Bulgaria's internal affairs through his actions. The Bulgarian government therefore requested the US government to immediately recall Donald Heath from Bulgaria. However, the US government sent a note to Bulgaria, threatening to sever diplomatic relations with Bulgaria unless the Bulgarian government withdrew its request for Heath's recall.

　　The Bulgarian government believed that there was no reason to withdraw its note or to yield to the ultimatum presented by the US government, and therefore did not respond to the US note. The US government then presented a second note to the Bulgarian government on February 20, announcing the recall of all personnel from its embassy in Sofia and requesting that Bulgaria recall its embassy personnel in Washington.

　　This arbitrary behavior of the US government clearly contradicts current diplomatic practices and international traditions, and has no legal or moral basis whatsoever. It can only be interpreted as an attempt to intensify an unfriendly policy and exert pressure on the People's Republic of Bulgaria. It is also a new method in the increasingly intensified struggle of the US imperialist bloc against the camp of peace and democracy. Progressive public opinion throughout the world, including progressive opinion in the United States, condemns this unfriendly behavior of the US government. The US government should bear full responsibility for this behavior.

　　保政府发表声明
    美召回驻保使馆人员的专断行为，美政府应负全责。
    【新华社北京二十六日电】塔斯社索非亚二十三日讯：保加利亚政府新闻处顷发表声明称：美国驻索非亚公使唐纳·希斯，曾按照与其外交职务不相容的方式行事，以其行动严重地干涉保加利亚内政。保加利亚政府为此曾要求美国政府立即从保加利亚召回唐纳·希斯。但美国政府却照会保加利亚，扬言除非保加利亚政府撤销其关于召回希斯的要求，否则便与保加利亚断绝外交关系。
    保加利亚政府认为没有理由撤销其照会及向美国政府所提出的最后通牒屈服，故对美国照会未予置答。美国政府复于二月二十日向保加利亚政府提出第二次照会，宣布召回其驻索非亚公使馆全体人员，并要求保加利亚召回其驻华盛顿公使馆的人员。
    美国政府这种专断的行为，显然与现行的外交惯例及国际传统相抵触，并且没有任何法律上或道义上的根据。它只能被解释为一种意欲加强不友好的政策和对保加利亚人民共和国施以压力的企图，也是美帝国主义集团对和平与民主阵营所进行的日渐加强的斗争的一种新方式。全世界进步舆论包括美国的进步舆论在内都痛斥美国政府这种不友善的行为。对于此种行为，美国政府应负全责。
