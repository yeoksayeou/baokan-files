Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, February 26th: Hong Kong dispatch: The British Supreme Court in Hong Kong announced on the 23rd of this month that the so-called "sale" of the Hong Kong-based aircraft of our Central and China Aviation Companies by the Kuomintang bandit gang was invalid, and lifted the three-month "injunction" on all assets of the two aviation companies. After the employees of the two companies announced their uprising in Hong Kong on November 9th of last year, the Kuomintang remnant bandit gang exhausted all despicable and shameless means in an attempt to plunder these assets belonging to the people. The Kuomintang bandit gang first requested the Hong Kong British authorities' court to "enjoin" the assets of the two companies, and then colluded with American warmongers Claire Chennault and Whiting Willauer, who came forward to claim that they had purchased the two companies' property from the Kuomintang bandit gang and participated in the lawsuit. Finally, Donovan, the head of American intelligence, came forward in the name of the person in charge of the so-called American "Civil Aviation Corporation," claiming that he had purchased the assets from Chennault and Willauer and requested to take over. Zhou Enlai, Premier of the State Council of our Central People's Government, and Zhong Chibing, Director of the Civil Aviation Administration, issued statements on December 3rd and 23rd of last year, respectively, addressing this conspiracy, pointing out that the two aviation companies belonged to our Central People's Government, and only our Central People's Government and the personnel entrusted by our Central People's Government had the right to dispose of the materials left in Hong Kong, and that no one should be allowed to infringe, move, or damage them by any means.

Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, February 26th: After the British court in Hong Kong ruled that the Kuomintang remnant bandits' "sale" of the aircraft of the two aviation companies in Hong Kong, which already belonged to our country, was invalid, the U.S. State Department submitted a so-called "strongly worded note" to the British government in Hong Kong. According to a Washington dispatch from the United States Information Service on the 24th, Acheson announced at a press conference that this "strongly worded note" had been submitted to the British government. This arrogant action of the U.S. government is naturally invalid, but it effectively exposes its imperialist face of interfering in other countries' internal affairs and hostility towards the Chinese people.

　　香港英最高法庭宣布
　　我两航在港资产解禁  残匪所谓“出售”无效
    美帝无耻竟提出所谓“强硬意见书”
    【新华社广州二十六日电】香港讯：香港英国最高法庭于本月二十三日宣布国民党匪帮对于我国中央、中国两航空公司留港飞机的所谓“出售”无效，并解除对两航空公司全部资产的为时三个月的“禁制”。按两公司员工于去年十一月九日在港宣布起义后，国民党残余匪帮曾用尽了卑鄙无耻的手段，企图掠夺这些属于人民的财产。国民党匪帮先向香港英国当局法庭请求“禁制”两公司资产，接着勾结美国战争贩子陈纳德和魏劳尔，由该两人出面，自认向国民党匪帮购得两公司财产，参加诉讼。最后又由美国特务头子杜诺万以所谓美国“民用航空公司”主持人的名义出面，指称已向陈纳德及魏劳尔两人购得该项资产，请求接管。我中央人民政府政务院周恩来总理及民航局钟赤兵局长于去年十二月三日及二十三日曾先后针对此项阴谋发表声明，指出：两航空公司为我中央人民政府所有，其留在香港的资材只有我中央人民政府和我中央人民政府所委托的人员，才有权处置，绝不容任何人以任何手段侵犯、移动或损害。
    【新华社北京二十六日电】在香港英国法庭判决国民党残匪将已属我国的两航空公司在港飞机“出售”无效后，美国务院竟向香港英政府提出所谓“强硬意见书”。据美国新闻处华盛顿二十四日电称：艾奇逊在记者招待会上宣布已将此项“强硬意见书”向英政府提出。美国政府的这种狂妄行动自然是无效的，但是有效地暴露了它的关于干涉外国内政和仇视中国人民的帝国主义面目。
