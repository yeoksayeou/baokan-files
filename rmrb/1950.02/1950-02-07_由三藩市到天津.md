　　From San Francisco to Tianjin
    Lao She
    I arrived in San Francisco just before the Double Tenth Festival, and Chinatown was decorated with lanterns and colored streamers in preparation for the celebration. In the hearts of our compatriots overseas, the Double Tenth Festival is as important as the Lunar New Year.
    I often hear people say that overseas Chinese often engage in gang fights and brawls due to conflicts of interest, family issues, and so on. In fact, this is a thing of the past. The compatriots who came in search of gold arrived around 1850. Now, San Francisco's Chinatown is built on several of the most respectable and important streets, and the compatriots are the most law-abiding citizens. Brawls have long disappeared.
    However, on the eve of the Double Tenth Festival, a struggle broke out here, and people were injured. This time, the fight was not for family or private conflicts of interest, but political.
    Young people and workers gathered together on the eve of the Double Tenth Festival, hung up the Five-Star Red Flag, and celebrated the birth of New China. This annoyed the old, reactionary people, who sent people to make trouble. The red flag was torn down, followed by a brawl.
    At 7 p.m. on the evening of the Double Tenth Festival, there was a lively parade in Chinatown. Fearing another incident, the streets were filled with police around 5 p.m. Unfortunately, I had an appointment and couldn't see the parade. I heard afterwards that the parade was peaceful. The procession paid tribute to Dr. Sun Yat-sen's statue, and representatives presented swords to Chiang Kai-shek and Li Zongren, which were accepted by the Consul General on their behalf.
    The world has been divided into two major camps, and the overseas Chinese in the United States are no exception: on the one hand, they hang up the red flag, and on the other hand, they present swords to the bandit chieftains who brought disaster to the country and the people.
    Here, we should correct a common mistake—that overseas Chinese are all conservative and backward. No, even in San Francisco and New York, there are young people and workers who hang up the red flag and cheer for New China.
    Even among those who followed the procession to present swords, many knew that the Chiang bandits were昏庸 and暴政, but out of respect for Dr. Sun Yat-sen, they couldn't help but join in the fun. Others, though with a high degree of patriotic enthusiasm, were confused by the anti-communist propaganda in the United States, and were very afraid of "communism."
    Not many of the older generation of overseas Chinese can read. Although the younger generation has received education, they cannot read Chinese English and Chinese books. There are few English books, and Chinese books cannot be obtained. The newspapers (Chinese) are mostly controlled by the Two Chens, who fabricate rumors at will. It is no wonder that they are not very clear about national affairs.
    The China Daily in New York is the only Chinese newspaper that can report correct news. We should provide it with more information—especially literary and artistic works and the new government's administrative program and implementation methods. In addition, we should send more literary and artistic books and publications.
    The ship sailed on October 13. There were twenty-two students returning to China on board. They held discussions every day to discuss how to serve the motherland, and reported on their specialized courses in order to exchange knowledge.
    At the same time, there were many other people returning to China on the ship who spent their days gambling and playing mahjong.
    There were several wealthy people on board, all Filipinos. Their clothes were more luxurious than those of the young American rich. Their shallowness and ignorance were more vulgar than American businessmen. They looked down on the Chinese.
    On the 18th, we arrived in Honolulu. In terms of flowers, weather, and scenery, this is truly a paradise on earth. There are flowers everywhere. On the street, every few steps, there is a florist selling garlands woven with gardenias, poppies, and other fragrant flowers; therefore, the street is also fragrant.
    Forty-eight percent of the population here are Japanese, and Chinese account for only more than twenty percent. The economic lifeline here is in the hands of the British and Americans. There has long been a proposal to change this place into the 49th state of the United States, but it has not been realized because there are too many Orientals. Good heavens, if Japanese or Chinese were elected as congressmen, wouldn't that be embarrassing for the United States?
    On the 27th, we arrived in Yokohama. The U.S. military organized a tour group, and passengers could buy tickets to visit Tokyo.
    We only had four or five hours and didn't see much. The road from Yokohama to Tokyo was originally an industrial zone. Now, it is just ruined tiles and broken houses, without chimneys; the factories have all been bombed.
    On the road, some people were waiting for the tram, wearing tattered clothes without a single piece of intact fabric. Many women no longer wear fancy long dresses, but instead wear long pants and short jackets.
    In Tokyo, people's clothes seemed a little neater, but still could not hide their poverty. Women still wear Western-style clothes, but their shoes and socks are very old. Many men still wear wartime military uniforms and wear the most hated military hats—the most common symbol of violence in Chinese dramas and paintings during the war of resistance.
    Didn't the Japanese children have rosy cheeks and look good before the war? Now, their faces are yellow and thin. The hanged war criminals only suffered one death; their remaining poison and scourge have affected future generations!
    From the mouths of the tour group's male and female leaders (Japanese), we heard that they had no sugar and bananas to eat—because they lost Taiwan! In fact, they lack more than just sugar and bananas. The reason why they only mentioned these two to the Chinese was perhaps to not forget Taiwan?
    On the 31st, we arrived in Manila. It's really hot here.
    The ships sunk in the war are still lying in the sea, surrounded by signs to prevent ships from accidentally hitting them.
    The Spanish-era churches and other buildings on the shore are still in ruins. The old city with walls was completely destroyed. The new city is under construction, and it is still very empty, looking a bit grandiose.
    I didn't want to disembark, because first, the ship has air conditioning, which is more comfortable than on shore. Second, I heard that Filipinos don't like Chinese; tax officials will search every pocket of Chinese who disembark to prevent smuggling. Third, the Philippines is about to elect a president, and there are brawls everywhere. It wouldn't be worth it to get accidentally injured.
    However, I finally got off the ship.
    After taking a walk in the city and suburbs, I heard some things worth recording: A large amount of gold and silver was shipped from Taiwan a few days ago. This news made me realize that although Chiang Kai-shek superficially wants to defend Taiwan to the death, he still refuses to distribute his gold and silver to the soldiers and ships it abroad. It is said that the Philippines has no industry; then, one can invest one's own wealth and that of one's lackeys in the Philippines; when one cannot stand in Taiwan, one can come to the Philippines to be a financial magnate. According to recent news, my guess is quite accurate. However, as I said earlier, Filipinos don't like Chinese. The reason is probably because Chinese have strong business acumen, which arouses the jealousy of Filipinos. Then, if the Chiang bandits and his gang go to the Philippines to invest and exploit the Filipinos, the Filipinos will probably rise up in resistance. Once the Filipinos rise up in resistance, those overseas Chinese in the Philippines will suffer unwarranted lawsuits. The Chiang bandits are really unlucky!
    The boat left Japan and encountered a typhoon. After leaving Manila, we encountered another typhoon. The two typhoons damaged my leg again. When I arrived in Hong Kong—November 4—I could hardly walk.
    I waited twenty-four days for a ship.
    In these twenty-four days, I saw merchants from the Tianjin gang, the Shandong gang, and the Guangdong gang搶購搶賣 various goods. Indoors and outdoors, even on the street, all I heard were business talks. They were glad that although they had abandoned Shanghai, Tianjin, and Qingdao, they had found a paradise for speculators in Hong Kong.
    I met two or three Englishmen, who all said steadily: New China must be recognized. When talking about the future of Hong Kong, they smiled and said nothing.
    An American businessman told me: "I am not worried about not having business for the time being; what is worrying is the future route of Sino-foreign trade! If the route goes 'north,' I will be really finished!"
    I also saw the young men and women who went to Guangzhou to慰劳 the People's Liberation Army. They all told me: "They are indeed disciplined, capable, and have a new atmosphere! We want to go again!"
    Finally, I got a ship ticket.
    It wasn't like boarding a ship, but like a group of pigs entering a pen. The gate on the dock was not open, but only a crack was opened in the small door in the gate. Therefore, passengers, porters, and thousands of pieces of luggage had to squeeze in through this crack. Shouting, squeezing, checking tickets, it was a mess. "Paradise"? Humph, this truly reveals the true colors of a colony. Spending money to buy a ticket, but having to turn into a pig! This is a British shipping company's ship!
    After squeezing through the door, Indian policemen inspected the luggage. Give money, and they let you go. If you don't give money, wait! That big black hand turned everything upside down, and even the boxes could not be closed.
    As soon as you get on the ship, the customs checks again. You have to hand in packages!
    Bah! What a rotten and smelly "fragrant" harbor!
    The ship sailed on the night of the 28th. The ship was small (more than 2,000 tons), and the waves were rough. Many people were seasick. To avoid encountering Chiang's gunboats, the ship went around the outside of Taiwan, not daring to enter the strait directly. After passing Shanghai, the wind became colder and colder, and snowflakes were flying in the air. Many passengers were sleeping on the deck, and their suffering can be imagined.
    On the 6th of December, we arrived in Incheon. Passengers were not allowed to land, fearing that they would carry communist propaganda and distribute it on shore. The tide of American anti-communism has gone so far, from San Francisco all the way to Korea!
    On the morning of the 9th, the ship arrived at Dagukou. There were many ice floes in the Hai River, and snow was falling in the air. It had been fourteen years since I left North China. Suddenly seeing ice and snow, and the yellow land on the riverbank, I couldn't help but tear up.
    Because the tide was not high enough, the ship stopped in the river for a while, and only started again at one o'clock in the afternoon; it was already dark when we arrived at the Tianjin pier.
    The people from the customs came. Unlike the tax officials in the Philippines and Hong Kong, they wouldn't even drink a bowl of tea on the ship. I thought to myself: China has indeed been reformed!
    My legs were inconvenient, and I had several pieces of luggage. How could I get off the ship? Fortunately, Mr. Ma Er was also on the ship. He bravely took the lead and went down first, telling me: "Wait for me here, I have a way!" A Shanghai businessman and a young woman who was originally at Fudan and now wants to enter the 革大, also came over to say hello: "Wait here, we will go down and take a look first."
    The tea attendant was even more anxious than me: "Is no one coming to pick you up? Can your legs walk? I think you should go down first, go down first! I will carry your luggage for you!" After such three persuasions and five encouragements, I handed the luggage to him and slowly twisted myself down; fortunately, I only fell "one" time in the crowd.
    The luggage was checked in a large warehouse, because it was inconvenient to work in the open air due to the snow on the ground. The luggage was neatly arranged in rows, without any mess; the tax officials checked them in order. The inspection was extremely thorough. Exchanging money—the foreign currency that passengers carried must be exchanged for RMB here—was also done in order, with good order. Who says the Chinese don't know how to keep order! With a new society, there will be a new social order!
    I met Ma Er and the two young people again. They helped me sit on the suitcase, and then went to find the liaison officer from the municipal government. They found them, two strong, gentle, and smiling young people. They led me to exchange money, and then arranged everything for me. At the same time, they introduced me to the staff on site, and everyone took turns coming over to shake hands with me and ask a few questions about the situation in the United States. Ah, I had just entered the country, but I felt the warmth of home! During the war of resistance, no matter where I was, the people who "entertained" me were always Kuomintang secret agents. What they gave me was terror and oppression—they made me feel like I was a petty thief. Now, I have been restored to being a human being again, living in a human society.
    After the inspection, the liaison officers called the porters, carried the luggage, and went to the reception center of the Foreign Affairs Office together. When we got there, it was already 10:30 at night; however, hot tea and food were still waiting for me.
    I couldn't see Tianjin in detail, firstly because my legs couldn't walk, and secondly because I was eager to go to Beijing. However, in the short two days, I felt that Tianjin was no longer the Tianjin of the past; because China was no longer the China of the past. What was even more flavorful was that before arriving at the new Tianjin of New China, I saw the gradually fascist United States, the Philippines at a crossroads, the militarily occupied Japan, and the colonial Hong Kong. From San Francisco to Tianjin, it is from fascism to new democracy, with the tides and conflicts stirred up by the two in between. I am glad to return to the motherland. The motherland is no longer a semi-colonial and semi-feudal country, but a brand-new and powerful force that will surely lead the oppressed people of the world to a path of light, peace, freedom, and happiness!

### 由三藩市到天津
老舍

　　由三藩市到天津
    老舍
    到三藩市（旧金山）恰好在双十节之前，中国城正悬灯结彩，预备庆贺。在我们侨胞心里，双十节是与农历新年有同等重要的。
    常听人言：华侨们往往为利害的，家族的，等等冲突，去打群架，械斗。事实上，这已是往日的事了；为寻金而来的侨胞是远在一八五○年左右；现在，三藩市的中国城是建设在几条最体面，最冲要的大街上，侨胞们是最守法的公民；械斗久已不见。
    可是，在双十的前夕，这里发生了斗争，打伤了人。这次的起打，不是为了家族的，或私人间利害的冲突，而是政治的。
    青年们和工人们，在双十前夕，集聚在一堂，挂起金星红旗，庆祝新中国的诞生。这可招恼了守旧的，反动的人们，就派人来捣乱。红旗被扯下，继以斗殴。
    双十日晚七时，中国城有很热闹的游行。因为怕再出事，五时左右街上已布满警察。可惜，我因有个约会，没能看到游行。事后听说，游行平安无事；队伍到孙中山先生铜像前致敬，并由代表们献剑给蒋介石与李宗仁，由总领事代收。
    全世界已分为两大营阵，美国的华侨也非例外：一方面悬起红旗，另一方面献剑给祸国殃民的匪酋。
    在这里，我们应当矫正大家常犯的一个错误——华侨们都守旧，落后。不，连三藩和纽约，都有高悬红旗，为新中国欢呼的青年与工人。
    就是在那些随着队伍，去献剑的人们里，也有不少明知蒋匪昏暴，而看在孙中山先生的面上，不好不去凑凑热闹的。另有一些，虽具有爱国的高度热诚，可是被美国的反共宣传所惑，于是就很怕“共产”。
    老一辈的侨胞，能读书的并不多。晚辈们虽受过教育，而读不到中国的英文与华文书籍。英文书很少，华文书来不到。报纸呢（华文的）又多被二陈所控制，信意的造谣。这也就难怪他们对国事不十分清楚了。
    纽约的华侨日报是华文报纸中唯一能报导正确消息的。我们应多供给它资料——特别是文艺与新政府行政的纲领与实施的办法。此外，也应当把文艺图书、刊物，多寄去一些。
    十月十三号开船。船上有二十二位回国的留学生。他们每天举行讨论会，讨论到祖国应如何服务，并报告自己专修过的课程，以便交换知识。
    同时，船上另有不少回国的人，却终日赌钱，打麻将。
    船上有好几位财主，都是菲律滨人。他们的服饰，比美国阔少的更华丽。他们的浅薄无知，好玩好笑，比美国商人更俗鄙。他们看不起中国人。
    十八日到檀香山。论花草，天气，风景，这真是人间的福地。到处都是花。街上，隔不了几步，便有个卖花人，将栀子，虞美人等香花织成花圈出售；因此，街上也是香的。
    这里百分之四十八是日本人，中国人只占百分之二十以上。这里的经济命脉却在英美人手里。这里，早有改为美国的第四十九州之议，可是因为东方民族太多了，至今未能实现。好家伙，若选出日本人或中国人作议员，岂不给美国丢人。
    二十七日到横滨。由美国军部组织了参观团，船上搭客可买票参加，去看东京。
    只有四五个钟头，没有看见什么。自横滨到东京，一路原来都是工业区。现在，只是败瓦残屋，并无烟筒；工厂都被轰炸光了。
    路上，有的人穿着没有一块整布的破衣，等候电车。许多妇女，已不穿那花狸狐哨的长衣，代替的是长裤短袄。
    在东京，人们的服装显得稍微整齐，而仍掩蔽不住寒伧。女人们仍有穿西服的，可是鞋袜都很破旧。男人们有许多还穿着战时的军衣，戴着那最恨的军帽——抗战中，中国的话剧中与图画中最习见的那凶暴的象征。
    日本的小孩儿们，在战前，不是脸蛋儿红扑扑的好看么？现在，他们的面黄肌瘦。被绞死的战犯只获一死而已；他们的遗毒余祸却殃及后代啊！
    由参观团的男女们领导员（日本人）口中，听到他们没有糖和香蕉吃——因为他们丢失了台湾！其实，他们所缺乏的并不止糖与香蕉。他们之所以对中国人单单提到此二者，倒许是为了不忘情台湾吧？
    三十一日到马尼拉。这地方真热。
    大战中打沉了的船还在海里卧着，四围安着标帜，以免行船不慎，撞了上去。
    岸上的西班牙时代所建筑的教堂，及其他建筑物，还是一片瓦砾。有城墙的老城完全打光。新城正在建设，还很空旷，看来有点大而无当。
    本不想下船，因为第一，船上有冷气设备，比岸上舒服。第二，听说菲律滨人不欢喜中国人；税吏们对下船的华人要搜检每一个衣袋，以防走私。第三，菲律滨正要选举总统，到处有械斗，受点误伤，才不上算。
    可是，我终于下了船。
    在城中与郊外转了一圈，我听到一些值得记下来的事：前两天由台湾运来大批的金银。这消息使我理会到，蒋介石虽在表面上要死守台湾，可是依然不肯把他的金银分给士兵，而运到国外来。据说，菲律滨并没有什么工业；那么，将自己的与他的走狗的财富，便可以投资在菲律滨；到台湾不能站脚的时候，便到菲律滨来作财阀了。依最近的消息，我这猜测是相当正确的。可是，我在前面说过，菲律滨人并不喜欢中国人。其原因大概是因为中国人的经营能力强，招起菲律滨人的忌妒。那么，假若蒋匪与他的匪帮到菲律滨去投资，剥削菲人，大概菲人会起来反抗的。一旦菲人起来反抗，那些在菲的侨胞便会吃挂误官司。蒋匪真是不祥之物啊！
    舟离日本，遇上台风。离马尼拉，再遇台风。两次台风，把我的腿又搞坏。到香港——十一月四日——我已寸步难行。
    等船，一等就是二十四天。
    在这二十四天里，我看见了天津帮、山东帮、广东帮的商人们，在抢购抢卖运各色的货物。室内室外，连街上，入耳的言语都是生意经。他们庆幸虽然离弃了上海天津青岛，而在香港又找到了投机者的乐园。
    遇见了两三位英国人，他们都稳稳当当的说：非承认新中国不可了。谈到香港的将来，他们便微笑不言了。
    一位美国商人告诉我：“我并不愁暂时没有生意；可虑的倒是将来中外贸易的路线！假若路线是走‘北’路，我可就真完了！”
    我可也看见了到广州去慰劳解放军的青年男女们。他们都告诉我：“他们的确有纪律、有本事、有新的气象！我们还想再去！”
    好容易，我得到一张船票。
    不像是上船，而像一群猪入圈。码头上的大门不开，而只在大门中的小门开了一道缝。于是，旅客、脚行、千百件行李，都要由这缝子里钻进去。嚷啊、挤啊、查票啊，乱成一团。“乐园”吗？哼，这才真露出殖民地的本色。花钱买票，而须变成猪！这是英国轮船公司的船啊！
    挤进了门，印度巡警检查行李。给钱，放行。不出钱，等着吧！那黑大的手把一切东西都翻乱，连箱子再也关不上。
    一上船，税关再检查。还得递包袱！
    呸！好腐臭的“香”港！
    二十八日夜里开船。船小（二千多吨），浪急，许多人晕船。为避免遭遇蒋家的炮舰，船绕行台湾外边，不敢直入海峡。过了上海，风越来越冷，空中飞着雪花。许多旅客是睡在甲板上，其苦可知。
    十二月六日到仁川，旅客一律不准登岸，怕携有共产党宣传品，到岸上去散放。美国防共的潮浪走得好远啊，从三藩市一直走到朝鲜！
    九日晨船到大沽口。海河中有许多冰块，空中落着雪。离开华北已是十四年，忽然看到冰雪，与河岸上的黄土地，我的泪就不能不在眼中转了。
    因为潮水不够，行了一程，船便停在河中，直到下午一点才又开动；到天津码头已是掌灯的时候了。
    税关上的人们来了。一点也不像菲律滨和香港的税吏们，他们连船上的一碗茶也不肯喝。我心里说：中国的确革新了！
    我的腿不方便，又有几件行李，怎么下船呢？幸而马耳先生也在船上，他奋勇当先的先下去，告诉我：“你在这里等我，我有办法！”还有一位上海的商人，和一位原在复旦，现在要入革大的女青年，也过来打招呼：“你在这里等，我们先下去看看。”
    茶房却比我还急：“没有人来接吗？你的腿能走吗？我看，你还是先下去，先下去！我给你搬行李！”经过这么三劝五劝，我把行李交给他，独自慢慢扭下来；还好，在人群中，我只跌了“一”跤。
    检查行李是在大仓房里，因为满地积雪，不便露天行事。行李，一行行的摆齐，丝毫不乱；税务人员依次检查。检查得极认真。换钱——旅客带着的外钞必须在此换兑人民券——也依次而进，秩序井然。谁说中国人不会守秩序！有了新社会，才会有新社会秩序呀！
    又遇上了马耳和那两位青年。他们扶我坐在衣箱上，然后去找市政府的交际员。找到了，两位壮实，温和，满脸笑容的青年。他们领我去换钱，而后代我布置一切。同时，他们把我介绍给在场的工作人员，大家轮流着抽空儿过来和我握手，并问几句美国的情形。啊，我是刚入了国门，却感到家一样的温暖！在抗战中，不论我在哪里，“招待”我的总是国民党的特务。他们给我的是恐怖与压迫——他们使我觉得我是个小贼。现在，我才又还原为人，在人的社会里活着。
    检查完，交际员们替我招呼脚行，搬运行李，一同到交际处的招待所去。到那里，已是夜间十点半钟；可是，滚热的茶饭还等着我呢。
    没能细看天津，一来是腿不能走，二来是急于上北京。但是，在短短的两天里，我已感觉到天津已非旧时的天津；因为中国已非旧时的中国。更有滋味的是未到新中国的新天津之前，我看见了那渐次变为法西斯的美国，徬徨歧途的菲律滨，被军事占领的日本，与殖民地的香港。从三藩市到天津，即是从法西斯到新民主主义，中间夹着这二者所激起的潮浪与冲突。我高兴回到祖国来，祖国已不是半殖民地半封建国家，而是崭新的，必能领导全世界被压迫的人民走向光明、和平、自由、与幸福的路途上去的伟大力量！
