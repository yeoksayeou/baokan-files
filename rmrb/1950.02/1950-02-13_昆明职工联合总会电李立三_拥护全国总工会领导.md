On the occasion of the enthusiastic holding of an expanded commemorative evening party to commemorate the glorious 27th anniversary of our working class's "February 7th" strike, our workers unanimously put forward a guarantee to commemorate "February 7th" by restoring production, developing production, and overcoming the current financial and economic difficulties. At the same time, we will work faithfully under the leadership of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions for the construction of a new democratic China.
