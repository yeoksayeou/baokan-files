Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, February 9th: Legal expert Dr. Mei Ru'ao, former judge of the International Military Tribunal for the Far East, recently spoke to reporters on the Soviet proposal to try Japanese bacteriological warfare criminals, saying: The Soviet government's proposal to various governments to appoint a special international military tribunal to try Japanese bacteriological warfare criminals is completely in line with the will of the Chinese people. These Japanese bacteriological warfare criminals violated humanity, violated international law, and committed heinous crimes against humanity and against China. Trying them is reasonable and legal. I, as a Chinese legal scholar, express my firm support for this.

Mei Ru'ao said: The people of the world support the Soviet proposal to try Emperor Hirohito and other bacteriological warfare criminals. Only the American imperialists are still trying to defend these war criminals. The American imperialists have two excuses for defending Hirohito and other war criminals. One is that, according to the "understanding" of the Far Eastern Commission's meeting on April 3, 1946, the Japanese Emperor has been exempted from being tried as a war criminal; the other is that, according to the Far Eastern Commission's resolution in April 1949, the war crimes trials had already ended. But both of these excuses are distortions of the facts and sophistry. In fact, the content of these two documents of the Far Eastern Commission is not like that. The Far Eastern Commission's "understanding" on April 3, 1946, only temporarily did not include Hirohito in the same indictment as Tojo, Doihara, and other first batch of twenty-eight top war criminals. This absolutely does not mean never to bring him to trial. As for the Far Eastern Commission's resolution last April, it only hoped that the member states would conclude the trials of Japanese war criminals as far as possible by the end of last September. This is only a suggestion, not an indication that trials of Japanese war criminals could not continue after last September. In fact, after last September, not only the Soviet Union, but also the Netherlands and the Philippines, continued to try Japanese war criminals. The bacteriological warfare crimes committed by Hirohito, Ishii, and others were discovered during the Khabarovsk trial last December. According to the basic principles of general criminal law, crime does not expire due to time limitations, and new evidence and new facts can cause any criminal to be tried at any time. Therefore, the Soviet Union's proposal to try Hirohito and others at this time is a completely reasonable and legal action. There is absolutely no law, agreement, resolution, or understanding in the international community that can prevent the Soviet Union from making this proposal. Anyone who refuses this completely just proposal under any pretext can only be seen as a collaborator with the bacteriological warfare criminals.

　　法学专家梅汝璈谈话
    拥护审判日细菌战犯
    苏联的提议完全合理合法，谁要拒绝这建议，只能表示他是战犯的合作者。
    【新华社北京九日电】中国法学专家前远东国际军事法庭法官梅汝璈博士，顷就苏联建议审讯日本细菌战犯一事，对记者发表谈话说：苏联政府向各国政府所提的委任国际特别军事法庭审讯日本细菌战犯的建议，是完全符合中国人民的意志的。这些日本细菌战犯违反人道，违反国际法，对人类对中国犯下了滔天大罪。审判他们是合理合法的。我以一个中国法学者的地位对此表示坚决的拥护。
    梅汝璈说：全世界人民都拥护苏联关于审判裕仁等细菌战犯的建议，只有美国帝国主义者尚企图为这些战犯辩护。美国帝国主义者为裕仁等战犯辩护的借口有两个，一个是说根据远东委员会一九四六年四月三日会议的“谅解”，已使日本天皇免被当作战争罪犯来审判；一个是说根据远东委员会一九四九年四月的决议，战犯审判早已结束。但这两个借口，都是歪曲事实，强词夺理的。事实上远东委员会的这两个文件的内容并非如此。一九四六年四月三日远东委员会的“谅解”只时暂时不把裕仁列为与东条、土肥原等第一批首级战犯二十八人同时起诉。这绝对不是说永不付审。至于远东委员会去年四月的决议，那只是希望各会员国对日本战犯的审判尽可能于去年九月底结束。这只是一项建议，并非表示去年九月以后不能继续对日本战犯举行审判。事实上在去年九月之后，不但苏联，就是荷兰、菲律宾，也仍有继续审讯日本战犯之事实。裕仁、石井等人所犯细菌战罪均系去年十二月伯力审判中所发现。根据一般刑法界基本原则，犯罪不因时效而消灭，新的证据，新的事实，可以随时使任何罪犯受审。所以苏联于此时提出审判裕仁等人，完全是合理合法的行动。国际间决没有任何法律、协定、决议或谅解可以阻止苏联提出这个建议。谁要是借故拒绝这个完全正义的建议，就只能表示他是细菌战犯的合作者。
