　　The Battle Fortress in Production
    Introducing the Experience of the Harbin Tram Factory Branch in Guaranteeing and Supervising Production
    Editor's Note: The Harbin Tram Factory Branch has played a certain exemplary role in guaranteeing and supervising production and promoting innovation record movement. The Northeast Bureau of the CPC Central Committee specially commended them for this and asked them to be familiar with and master production operations, conscientiously inspect work, correct the erroneous phenomenon of party members and workers only learning politics and not technology, restore technical learning organizations, closely connect the Party with the masses, and pay attention to absorbing outstanding elements into the Party during production movements. Currently, the branch is making further efforts to strengthen its fortress role in production. The following experiences are provided for reference, and we hope everyone will actively write articles introducing experiences from all over the country.
    The Harbin Tram Factory began building its Party organization in October 1946, established a branch in February 1947, and went public in July 1948. It currently has 65 party members, accounting for 9.4% of the factory's total employees. The factory suffered a fire during New Year's Day last year. Before the fire, it had 29 trams in operation. Thanks to the efforts of the employees, after the "May 1st" competition, the number increased to 38, and then to 41 by "July 1st." At the same time, quality improved and accidents decreased. In January, an innovation record movement was launched, and a large number of rationalization proposals and new records emerged. The production efficiency of the two main production departments, the mechanical department and the electrical department, has increased by 36.7% compared to the original standard time. The achievement of these results is inseparable from the branch's supervisory and guaranteeing role.

  Transforming Administrative Plans into Mass Plans
    The Harbin Tram Factory branch has focused on transforming administrative production tasks and plans into the tasks and plans of each worker in every production movement. After the branch issued a call for each party member to formulate a personal plan at the beginning of the record-breaking movement, it separately convened informal discussion meetings of party members in the three key groups of fitters, foundry workers, and inspectors, to encourage everyone to study and discuss, and specifically find ways to help many party members formulate plans for creation, invention, and tool improvement. Then, it used this to persuade and mobilize all party members. However, because the people who formulated the plans were mostly party members with high technical skills, and the plans they formulated were mostly related to creating and improving tools, many party members were frightened and did not dare to formulate plans. After discovering the bias, the branch immediately mobilized again, putting forward the mass slogan of "Create what you do." In this way, each party member put forward practical and specific plans, and promoted and helped the masses formulate plans. Soon, the Youth League members, under the leadership of the party members, also made guarantees. The Party, combined with the Youth League and the trade union, concentrated its efforts and invested in the movement. During the "May 1st" competition, the management committee originally set the task at 33 trams. After studying the situation, the branch believed that it could be increased, so it proposed the slogan of striving to complete 35 trams. At the party member meeting, it mobilized each party member to take the lead in formulating plans, and launched challenges between various departments. After the meeting, everyone's enthusiasm was high, and they competed to challenge and formulate plans. The branch seized the opportunity to cooperate with the administration and the trade union to convene a challenge competition meeting for all employees. Party members led the masses, advanced departments led backward departments, setting off a wave of competition. At the meeting, everyone unanimously proposed the slogan of completing 38 trams. Finally, the management committee determined to "guarantee the completion of 35 and strive to complete 38 trams," amending the original plan.

    Persuasion and Encouragement Guarantee Full Enthusiasm
    Propaganda, encouragement, persuasion, and education, guaranteeing full enthusiasm and achieving ideological unity, are equally crucial to the success or failure of production movements. When the record-breaking movement was proposed for discussion at the management committee, the masses had not yet been mobilized, and some cadres had ideological resistance. It was decided to first conduct ideological mobilization, starting with only half an hour of amateur study for party members, and soon absorbing some of the production activists among the Youth League members and the masses, as well as Party, government, trade union, and Youth League cadres. Then, with them as the backbone, under the leadership of the branch and the call of the trade union, a wave of study was launched among all employees of the factory. During the study, everyone quickly realized the significance of the record-breaking movement and its relationship to the workers' own interests. Some ideological concerns were exposed during the discussion: such as fear that exceeding the time and quality standards would not lead to extra rewards; fear of staff reduction, worrying about "what to do if production increases and people are laid off and become unemployed"; or confusing it with the merit-making competition, feeling that "it's just making us work more." The branch, on the one hand, provided correct answers, and on the other hand, reflected the concerns to the higher-level Party committee, prompting the administration to conduct a powerful mobilization at the second mobilization meeting, targeting the ideological concerns of the masses. This truly cleared the obstacles to the movement from the thoughts of cadres and the masses, providing a powerful guarantee for the development of the movement.

    Party Members Take the Lead in Using Their Brains to Think of Ways to Create Records
    At the beginning of the record-breaking movement, when inventions and technical tool improvements were mentioned, the workers felt that "that must be done by those with high technical skills or leading cadres, we have low education and no time to study" (most of those who were awarded at the second mobilization meeting were engineers, directors, group leaders, etc.), especially apprentices and helpers (they were numerous) who thought "how can we compare with the masters, even the master craftsmen haven't created anything, we are even less useful!" Just talking reason couldn't win people's hearts, so the branch found a progressive and active party member, Li Wenxiang, a college apprentice in the foundry group, and encouraged him to make achievements to promote the masses, while also mobilizing his master, Chen Qilun (a party member), to help and guide him. Li Wenxiang painstakingly researched and created a new record for making Siemens large gears. In the past, the standard was thirteen hours. He added two molds to save the effort of digging holes, and improved the operating method of pounding sand and applying lead powder. He also removed the screws on the light iron mold when turning the sand to avoid people helping to lift, saving labor and shortening time, completing it in five hours and thirty-four minutes, improving efficiency by 180%. This caused a sensation throughout the factory. The branch, the Youth League, and the trade union used this to publicize and encourage apprentices, helpers, and workers with lower technical skills. Everyone knew that as long as they were willing to study, there would be a way. The workers said: "The merit-making competition only talked about burying your head in hard work and being consistently active, now we have to use our brains." Even backward workers were thinking about ways to find methods all day long. Party members not only promoted the movement forward with their exemplary role in their own posts, but also publicized, explained, and helped solve problems to the masses anytime and anywhere. Party member Liu Helin had a predetermined plan to create large wire hangers, but he did not do it alone. He studied it with everyone in the production group meeting, which increased the enthusiasm of the workers. When Sui Anguo, a fitter, timed him, he was very dissatisfied, thinking that he was there to supervise his work. Party member Li Yongde patiently explained the benefits of timing to him. He repented and said: "Why didn't you tell me earlier?" Party members paid attention at all times, and if they found any problems, they immediately reported them to the branch. The branch urged the administration to solve them in time. The branch also checked and studied various problems at any time, and solved them in due course to ensure that the movement was always full of enthusiasm.

    Not Yielding to Difficulties, Guaranteeing Completion of Tasks
    Whenever difficulties were encountered in the production movement, and the morale of the masses was low and the tasks were difficult to complete, the branch always assisted the administration and the trade union with the greatest organizational work and encouragement to reverse the situation and break through the difficulties. In the production competition to welcome "July 1st", the Construction Bureau gave the task of increasing two trams. All employees believed that it was not a problem and decided to increase three trams, reaching 41 trams. But in June, difficulties came. A batch of motors reached the end of their life, large gears had chipped teeth, the flat copper wire purchased in Shenyang had not arrived in time, too many broken cars, the wire loops could not be wound, female workers did not want to work overtime after night school... By June 27, not only had no new cars been added, but the original 38 cars could not be maintained. All the cadres were panicked, some lost confidence, and individual administrative cadres suggested not repairing the difficult ones, and only repairing the easy ones, just completing 40. In such difficult circumstances, the branch committee, after research, resolutely proposed "to complete the task of 41 trams without compromise." They conducted research separately with the administration, the trade union, and the Youth League. First, internal party mobilization, and then through party and Youth League member relationships, mobilizing and talking to the workers, solving various specific difficulties, calling on and asking workers who wanted to join the party to help with the car platform, and proposing to them "strengthen unity, overcome the difficulties of increasing the cars, and strive to join the party by completing the task of increasing the cars." On the 27th, a mobilization meeting of all party members and activists was held. Due to thorough preparation before the meeting, the difficulties raised by each department were resolved, and the time for each department and each car to be completed was specifically planned. The workers' confidence was greatly improved. After the meeting, everyone mobilized tensely and worked separately. Party member Zou Kuiwen led the workers to drop four cars that night (including one new car), and the workers were even more excited. Finally, on June 30, they completely completed the task of 41 trams. Ten party members were developed during the movement. The branch's prestige was greatly improved among the masses. In the record-breaking movement, the branch always paid attention to the changes brought about by the movement. In mid-November, the movement entered a climax, but since December, new records have gradually become scarce. The branch immediately analyzed and studied the group reports, and found that the reason for the stagnation of the movement was: there was a lack of coordination between the work sequence departments, and a contact contract must be established; the rewards were not timely; the phenomenon of waiting for materials to stop work was serious; the workers requested to find new technical quotas based on the new situation and increase wages; the higher-level leadership organs did not solve the problems in time; and certain systems limited production. The branch also assisted the administration in studying these new issues, reflecting them to the higher-level Party committee. With the guidance and assistance of the higher-level Party committee, some of the problems were solved. The factory held a meeting of employee representatives to discuss the issue of contact contracts, and improved the wage system and administrative management, so that the movement could develop to a higher stage.

    What are the reasons for the Harbin Tram Factory Branch's achievements? First of all, the leading ideology is clear, and truly guarantees that production is regarded as the most important task. The Party's organizational life and the Party's propaganda and education work are closely combined with guaranteeing and supervising production. The branch is very strict in grasping the organizational life and study of party members. There is a small group meeting every Saturday, and party members first study separately in groups for half an hour before the workers study every day. There is a branch meeting every half month to a month. These meetings and studies are always centered on the current production tasks, so the content of the meetings is substantial and greatly helps and educates party members. At the same time, it also promoted production. On the other hand, because the branch's leading ideology is clear, the relationship between the Party and the government in the factory is normal. They do not have the problem of quarreling relationships like some factories, nor do they entangle in trivial matters and issues such as the scope of rights. Because the branch really guarantees production, the administration dares to be independently responsible, and the branch also dares to boldly provide opinions. The responsibilities are clear, and they respect, unite, and cooperate with each other. In this case, the fighting fortress role of the branch in production can be fully utilized. (Attached picture)

　　生产中的战斗堡垒
    介绍哈尔滨电车厂支部保证与监督生产的经验
    编者按：哈尔滨市电车厂支部在保证与监督生产推动创新纪录运动上是起了一定的模范作用的，中共中央东北局为此曾特别予以表扬，并要求他们熟悉与掌握生产业务。认真检查工作，纠正党员及工人只学政治不学技术的错误现象，恢复技术学习组织，密切党群关系以及在生产运动中注意吸收优秀分子入党等意见。现该支部正在进一步努力加强生产中的堡垒作用。本文提供的若干经验可供参考，并望大家踊跃写稿介绍全国各地经验。
    哈尔滨电车厂于一九四六年十月开始建党，一九四七年二月成立支部，一九四八年七月公开党。现有党员六五人，占全厂职工百分之九·四。该厂在去年元旦时曾遭火烧一次。火烧前出车二九台，由于职工们的努力，经过“五一”竞赛，增至三八台，“七一”又增至四一台，同时质量提高事故减少。一月又展开了创新纪录运动，涌现了大批的合理化建议和新纪录，机械部电机部两个主要生产部门，生产效率已较原定标时提高百分之三六·七。这些成绩的获得是和支部的监督保证作用分不开的。
  把行政计划变成群众的计划
    把行政上的生产任务与计划变成每个工人自己的任务与计划，哈尔滨电车厂支部在每一个生产运动中都抓紧了这一点。创纪录运动开始支部发出每个党员订出个人计划的号召后，就分别召集钳工、铸工、检车三重点组的党员漫谈会，启发大家研究商讨，并具体想办法帮助不少党员订出创造发明和改进工具的计划。接着就以此来说服动员全体党员。但因为订计划的多是技术高的党员，他们订出的计划多是有关创造改进工具的，于是不少党员就吓得不敢订了。支部发现偏向后立即再次动员，提出“干啥创啥”的群众性口号。这样，每个党员都提出了切合实际的具体计划，并且推动帮助群众订计划。很快的团员们在党员的带头下也都提出保证。党结合团及工会在一起集中力量，投入运动中去。在“五一”竞赛时，管委会原定任务为三十三台车。支部研究了情况后认为可以增多，遂提出了争取完成三十五台车的口号。在党员大会上，动员每个党员带头订计划，并发动组部之间的挑战。会后大家情绪高涨，纷纷竞赛挑战订计划，支部遂抓紧时机协同行政、工会召开全体职工的挑战竞赛大会。党员带动群众，先进部门带动落后部门，掀起竞赛热潮，大会上一致提出了完成三十八台车的口号。最后管委会确定为“保证完成三十五台，争取完成三十八台”，修正了原来的计划。
    说服鼓动保证情绪饱满
    宣传鼓动说服教育，保证情绪饱满取得思想一致，同样是生产运动成败的关键。创纪录运动在管委会上提出讨论时，群众尚未发动，部分干部思想有抵抗。遂决定先作思想动员，开始仅只党员业余学习半小时，很快又吸收一部分团员和群众中的生产积极分子及党、政、工、青干部参加。接着又以他们为骨干，在支部领导和工会号召下，掀起全厂职工的学习热潮。学习中大家很快地认识到创纪录运动的意义和与工人切身利益的关系。在讨论中暴露了一些思想顾虑：如怕提高定时定质得不到超奖；怕减员，担心“生产提高了往下裁人失业怎么办”；或者是和立功竞赛相混淆，觉得“还不是让我们多干活”等。支部一方面给予正确解答，一方面反映给上级党委，推动行政在二次动员大会上针对群众思想顾虑，作了有力的动员。真正从干群思想上扫除运动的障碍，为运动的开展提供了有力的保证。
    党员带头用脑子想办法创造纪录
    创纪录运动开始时，一提发明创造改进技术工具，工人们就觉着“那总得技术高的或头头脑脑干部才行，咱文化程度低，又没功夫研究”（在二次动员大会上受奖的大多是工程师、主任、小组长等），特别是学徒和帮工匠们（他们人数很多）更认为“怎能和师傅比，大工匠还没创出来，咱们更不顶事了！”光讲道理打不通人心，支部便找了一个政治进步生产积极的党员铸工组大学徒李文祥，鼓动他作出成绩推动群众，同时又动员了他师傅陈启纶（党员）帮助指教。李文祥钻心研究创造了做西门子大齿轮的新纪录。过去标定十三小时，他添作二个胎省去掏眼工夫，又改进了捣沙抹铅粉的操作方法，又在翻沙时去掉轻铁型上螺丝免去人帮抬，省工缩时，五时三四分就完成了，提高效率百分之一百八十。这一来轰动了全厂，支部、青年团、工会都以此向学徒、帮工匠和技术较低的工人宣传鼓动。大家知道了只要肯钻研都会有办法，工人们说：“立功竞赛光讲埋头苦干一贯积极，现在得用脑子了。”甚至落后工人也都成天寻思琢磨想办法。党员不仅以在自己岗位上的模范作用推动运动前进，并随时随地向群众宣传解释帮助解决问题。党员刘和林早有预定计划创造大线线吊，可是他不自己一人干，在生产小组会内和大伙研究，使工友们情绪为之提高。钳工组隋安国当职员给他进行标定时，非常不满，以为是来监督他干活了。党员李永德便耐心给他解释定时的好处，他后悔的说：“你怎么早不告诉我呢？”党员们时时注意，发现有问题就立刻向支部汇报。由支部督促行政及时解决。支部也随时检查研究各种问题，并适时解决，以保证运动经常饱满。
    不向困难低头保证完成任务
    在生产运动中每逢碰到困难，群众情绪低落任务不好完成时，支部总是以最大的组织工作和鼓动力量协助行政、工会，扭转情况突破难关。在迎接“七一”的生产竞赛中，建设局给了增车两台的任务，全体职工认为不成问题，决议增车三台，达到四十一台。但到六月份困难来了，一批电动机到了寿命，大齿轮掉牙，在沈阳买的扁铜线没有及时来到，坏车太多，线环缠不上，女工上夜校不愿加班……。到了六月二十七不但一台新车未增，原来三十八台车都保持不住了。全体干部都着了慌，有些人失掉了信心，个别行政干部提出难修的不修，光修好修的，四十台数完成就行了。在这样困难重重的情况下，支委会经过研究，坚决提出“要不折不扣的完成四十一台车的任务”。他们分头和行政、工会、青年团进行研究。首先党内动员，再通过党、团员关系向工友们动员谈话，解决各项具体困难，号召要求入党的工友帮助车台架车，向他们提出“加强团结，克服增车困难，以完成增车任务来争取入党”。二十七日又召开了全体党员积极分子大会进行动员。由于会前准备充分，各部所提出的困难都得了解决，并具体计划了每部及每台车完成的时间，工友信心大大提高。会后全体紧张动员起来，分头努力。党员邹奎文带领职工当天晚上落下四台车（内新车一台），工友们更为振奋，终于在六月三十号彻底完成四十一台车的任务。运动中并发展了十个党员。支部威信在群众中大大提高。在创纪录运动中，支部时刻注意运动所起变化。十一月中旬运动进入高潮，但十二月以来新纪录逐渐稀少。支部立即分析研究小组汇报，找出运动停滞原因在于：工序衔接部门产生了不衔接现象，必须订立联系合同；奖励不及时；停工待料现象严重；工友们要求根据新情况找出新技术定额，提高工资；上级领导机关解决问题不及时；以及某些制度对生产的局限性等。支部还协助行政研究这些新课题，一边反映给上级党委，在上级党委的指导与帮助下，部分问题获得解决。厂内则召开职工代表会议讨论联系合同问题，改进工资制度与行政管理，以便运动向更高阶段发展。
    电车厂支部获得这些成绩的原因在那里呢？首先在于领导思想明确，真正把保证生产当成头等重要任务。党的组织生活与党的宣传教育工作都与保证监督生产紧密结合。支部对党员组织生活和学习是抓的很紧，每礼拜六一次小组会，每天工人学习前党员先单独分组学习半小时，每半月到一月一次支部大会，这些会议和学习总是围绕着当前的生产任务来进行的，因之会议内容充实，对党员帮助教育很大。同时也推动了生产。另一方面，由于支部领导思想明确，厂内党政关系也就正常，他们没有像某些厂子闹关系的问题，也没有在枝枝节节琐碎事务上和权利范围等问题上纠缠不清。由于支部确实保证了生产，行政上也就敢于独立负责，支部也敢大胆提供意见，职责分明互相尊重，团结，合作。在这种情况下支部在生产中的战斗堡垒作用就得以充分发挥了。（附图片）
