　　What Has the "Marshall Plan" Brought to the People of Western Europe?
　　Ding Ming
    The so-called "Marshall Plan," which the Truman government implemented in April 1948 to save the U.S. economic crisis, has been in place for almost two years. Despite the great fanfare from the "Marshall Plan" organizers and their European lackeys, claiming that the plan's purpose was to "revive the European economy," the facts of the past two years have shown that the economic difficulties of Western European countries have deepened, and the lives of the people have worsened.
    Currently, the Marshallized countries of Western Europe are experiencing an escalating crisis of product stagnation, reduced production, increased unemployment, and a severe dollar shortage. This stands in stark contrast to the thriving Eastern European people's democratic countries, which are rapidly embarking on the path of socialist construction with the sincere assistance of the Soviet Union.
    The true purpose of American monopoly capital in implementing the "Marshall Plan" through the Truman government is quite clear. They are taking advantage of the post-war decline and difficulties of their European sidekicks, using "aid" and "gifts" to enslave Western European countries, control Western European markets, and turn Western Europe into an American economic colony. At the same time, they are gradually establishing their political and military dominance in the Marshallized countries, making the latter completely subordinate to U.S. war policy. The signing of the "North Atlantic Treaty" and the "Mutual Defense Assistance Act" based on this treaty has further confirmed the subordinate relationship of the Marshallized countries to the United States.
    The Predatory Nature of the "Marshall Plan"
    The "Marshall Plan" bill passed by the U.S. Congress on April 2, 1948, fully demonstrates its predatory nature.
    The bill stipulates that "recipient countries" must accept the following conditions that sacrifice national sovereignty: the United States will send delegations to oversee the use of funds, and all countries must obtain the approval of the U.S. representatives in advance for their use of funds; designate a certain country to specialize in the production of certain raw materials that are beneficial to the United States and not produce goods that compete with the United States; the sixteen Western European countries must not engage in legitimate trade with the Soviet Union and the Southeast European people's democratic countries; 50 percent of U.S. aid items must be shipped by U.S. ships; "recipient countries" must supply the United States with various "strategic materials" and protect U.S. private investment and development rights, and so on.
    Moreover, the United States has stipulated that "recipient countries" must first conclude "bilateral agreements" with the United States before they can receive "aid." The "bilateral agreement" is an important means for the United States to defeat Western European countries one by one, and the conditions for receiving "aid" stipulated therein are even more stringent. Taking the Franco-American "bilateral agreement" as an example, in addition to the above-mentioned general conditions, it also includes the following humiliating clauses: France allows the United States to freely obtain "strategic materials"; France must submit certain industrial development plans (especially coal industry, etc.) to the U.S. Economic Cooperation Administration for approval; the United States has the right to demand the devaluation of the franc; the French government must implement the trade policies formulated by the Geneva and Havana conferences, etc.
    The so-called Geneva and Havana conferences were meetings initiated by the United States held in Geneva in April 1947 and in Havana in November 1948, respectively, to discuss the "International Trade Organization." The result of the meetings was the passage of the so-called "Charter of the International Trade Organization," which aims to facilitate the U.S. to implement its dumping policy to monopolize the world market, including: abolishing tariff barriers, and not freely increasing tariffs; establishing most-favored-nation clauses, prohibiting the control of import and export trade and foreign exchange; freely purchasing raw materials; abolishing the British Empire preferential system, etc. This is to open up the markets of various countries to American goods.
    "Marshall Plan" Causes Production Decline in Western Europe
    The "aid" of the "Marshall Plan" has brought disastrous consequences to Western Europe.
    The industrial production of Western European countries has declined due to the acceptance of the "aid" of the "Marshall Plan." In the first year of the "Marshall Plan"--1948, the rate of expansion of industrial production in almost all Western European countries was lower than in 1947. For example, France decreased by 6 percent, Norway by 6 percent, and Belgium by 16 percent. In the first nine months of 1949, their production further declined.
    In Italy, industrial production began to decline in the fall of 1948, and production in the first few months of 1949 was much lower than in 1947. Italy's shipbuilding industry has reduced production and gone bankrupt. Because the Gasperi government followed the orders of the organizers of the Marshall Plan, on the one hand, it purchased 103 Liberty ships from the United States, and on the other hand, it rejected orders from the Soviet Union. As a result, the famous Turin "Fiat" ship engine factory had already reduced production in the spring of last year. The famous "Ansaldo" shipyard has also stopped shipbuilding due to the execution of the American order prohibiting shipbuilding. As for the Genoa shipyard, its production had been reduced by two-thirds a year ago because it was ordered not to accept Soviet orders. The "Livorno" shipyard also cut production for the same reason.
    The Italian Reconstruction Committee (composed of representatives from various ministries) followed the "aid" conditions that it was not allowed to produce itself and had to buy from the United States, and on the one hand, ordered the "Breda" factory to reduce motor production under the order of the Economic Cooperation Administration, and on the other hand, purchased the machine from the United States. For the same reason, the "Ilida" factory, which produces steel plates and steel rails, has reduced production; as for "Caproni," a factory that produces electric steam locomotives and buses, its chimneys have long stopped smoking.
    The reduction in coal production in Belgium is also a prominent example of the disastrous nature of the "Marshall Plan." The country's coal production in the fall of last year was 12 percent lower than before the war, but coal stocks still increased month by month. This is because France was ordered to purchase American coal at a high price of 21 U.S. dollars per ton and import coal from the U.S.-controlled Ruhr, thus causing Belgium to lose the French market. At the same time, Belgian coal in Italy and North Africa could not be sold due to competition from American coal. For the same reason, in 1948, Belgium's cotton fabrics and linen fabrics were also lower than in 1947; and in the second quarter of 1939, its steel and milled iron production decreased by 13 percent and 25 percent respectively compared with the first half of the same year.
    In France, the aircraft industry is reducing production or closing down. Because the French government was ordered to use American aircraft in all its airlines. As a result, the French aircraft manufacturing industry, which could produce 159 aircraft per month in 1947, had been reduced to an average of 99 aircraft per month by 1948.
    Due to the fact that the United States did not supply the raw materials that should have been supplied under the "Marshall Plan," and that 50 percent of the U.S. "aid" goods were required to be transported by American ships in the "aid" conditions, the French shipbuilding industry was reduced from the usual 250,000 tons per year to about 130,000 tons last year.
    Even worse is the French film industry. According to the Blum-Byrnes agreement, American films should be screened in France for nine weeks out of every thirteen weeks. Later, Johnston, chairman of the Motion Picture Association of America, further used the convenience of the "Marshall Plan" to make American films occupy French theaters at dumping prices, so that Hollywood's old films flooded France, making French films almost completely expelled from the market. Last summer, the French press had already lamented that the French film industry was "on the verge of disaster," and some even declared that it "no longer exists." Hollywood also took advantage of the plight of unemployed French stars to transport the leading actors to the United States.
    The manufacture of French automobile tractors and lathes has long been reduced. Why? Also because, according to the American "aid" conditions, France must purchase the above-mentioned machines from the United States.
    Britain, as an American broker, is not in a better situation than other countries. In 1948, its cotton fabric production was 48 percent lower than in 1937; in June last year, some textile enterprises in the Lancashire textile center closed down due to lack of orders. Orders for shipbuilding decreased due to restrictions on U.S. "aid," and orders for light machinery were reduced by 50 percent last summer compared with 1948. Other industries, such as cotton spinning, woolen products, hydro-rotary motorcycles, electrical equipment, and radios, have also reduced production one after another because the United States used American aid to compete.
    The decline in the industry of Western European countries is deliberately caused by American imperialism. In addition to using the above-mentioned various "aid" conditions to stifle the industry of Western European countries, the United States also deliberately did not provide production equipment in the items "aiding" them. For example, in the 3,977.6 million U.S. dollars given to European "recipient" countries by the United States under the "Marshall Plan" in 1949, the amount used to purchase industrial equipment was only 93 million U.S. dollars. Among the large number of items shipped to France, production equipment accounted for only 2 percent. It can be seen from here that the purpose of the "Marshall Plan" is not to "revive" but to strangle the economy of Western Europe.
    "Marshall Plan" Causes Sharp Decline in Western European Trade
    The "Marshall Plan" has created an increasingly deteriorating trade situation for Western European countries. On the one hand, the United States used the "Marshall Plan" to vigorously dump its surplus products into Western Europe; on the other hand, it tried its best to reduce the import of Western European goods. For example, in June last year, the goods exported by the United States to Western Europe were more than 406 million U.S. dollars, while the exports of Western Europe to the United States were only 66 million U.S. dollars. Taking individual countries as an example, in March and April last year, the goods exported by the United States to the Netherlands were twenty times the amount exported by the Netherlands to the United States. In June last year, British exports to the United States were almost twice as less as in the same period in 1948. The United States not only directly transports a large number of goods from its own country to seize the Western European market, but also strives to win the markets of Western European countries by supporting the industrial method of West Germany. For example, the United States once used the method of the Economic Cooperation Administration lending 20 million U.S. dollars to the West German leather industry to seize the French market, resulting in a great blow to the French raw and tanned leather industry, and after the French footwear industry was competed by Germany, sales decreased from 63 million pairs in 1938 to 40 million pairs in 1948.
    The dumping of American goods has also disrupted the internal trade of Western European countries and reduced its quantity day by day. In 1948, trade between Western European countries was less than 75 percent of that in 1938. In addition, the United States prohibits Western European countries from trading with the Soviet Union and the Southeast European people's democratic countries. There are two purposes: First, to prevent Western Europe from breaking away from American control and continuing to buy American grain and raw materials at high prices; second, to vainly try to prevent the rapid economic development of the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries. Everyone knows that there are at least three major benefits for Western European countries to trade with the Soviet Union and the Southeast European people's democratic countries: First, the economies of the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries are constantly developing, and the industrial equipment produced by Western European countries can find a market there; second, they have sufficient grain and raw materials to supply Western Europe, and the prices are cheap; third, Western European countries do not have to pay for trade with Eastern Europe in U.S. dollars, which can save U.S. dollar expenditures. However, under the orders of American capital, Western European rulers refused to trade with the Soviet Union and the Southeast European people's democratic countries. Therefore, trade between Eastern and Western Europe began to decline sharply in the first year of the "Marshall Plan"--1948. The trade volume of that year was less than 42 percent of the pre-war level (1938). According to the "European Economic Cooperation Agency," trade between Eastern and Western Europe in 1952 will still be lower than the total value of 800 million U.S. dollars in 1938. It can be seen from this to what extent the trade losses suffered by Western Europe due to the "Marshall Plan" have reached.
    Because Western European countries refuse to trade with Eastern Europe, because they must buy what they need from the United States, and because of their huge trade deficit with the United States, serious U.S. dollar deficits have been formed in Marshallized countries. According to the Economic Cooperation Administration Bulletin, in 1949-50, the Western European U.S. dollar deficit will reach 4.5 billion U.S. dollars. In 1952, the year when the "Marshall Plan" ends, it is estimated that the deficit will still reach 3 billion U.S. dollars. This announcement fully exposes the lies of the executors of the "Marshall Plan" and the illusions of Western European recipients. They said: In 1952, the Western European economy will tend to be "stable and self-reliant" and will cure the chronic U.S. dollar deficit disease.
    "Marshall Plan" Makes Western European People's Lives Worsen
    Since the "Marshall Plan" has caused the industrial decline and trade decline of Western European countries, its inevitable result is the sharp deterioration of the lives of the working people of Western European countries. This is first manifested in the rapid increase in the number of unemployed. It is estimated that the number of unemployed in Marshallized countries, including family members, is currently about 25 million.
    In the approximately one year that the "Marshall Plan" has been implemented, the number of unemployed in Belgium, a small country, has almost quadrupled; in the first nine months of last year, it increased by more than double compared with the same period of the previous year. There are now about 300,000 unemployed people.
    In Italy, officials admitted that in the fall of 1948, the number of unemployed had reached 2.4 million, an increase of 33 percent compared with the fall of 1947. That is to say, the "Marshall Plan" has increased the number of unemployed by more than 500,000. There are currently 3 million unemployed people in Italy.
    Statistics released by the West German occupation authorities show that unemployment increased by 50 percent in 1948, and more than doubled in the first nine months of last year compared with the same period of the previous year. Currently, the number of unemployed in the area has reached 2 million.
    Although Britain has maintained an army several times larger than before the war, the number of unemployed also reached 324,000 in November last year.
    According to French official statistics, the number of people in France who live on unemployment benefits quadrupled in 1948. In the first nine months of last year, it increased by 1.6 times compared with the first nine months of the previous year. The sharp deterioration of the lives of the working people is also reflected in the continuous rise in the cost of living and the reduction in the actual income of the working people.
    The price increases in Britain in the past two years have reduced the real wages of British workers by 3 percent. The purchasing power of the French working people in the year before September last year has been reduced by 20 percent, and the consequences of the devaluation of the franc have not been included. The actual wages of West German workers are currently less than 60 percent of what they were in 1936. According to Belgian official statistics, the cost of living increased by 20 percent in 1948. In the Netherlands during the same period, the cost of living increased by 15 percent. In 1949, the cost of living index of all Western European Marshallized countries has increased more than in 1948, even Turkey has increased by 11 percent, and Austria has increased by 37 percent. The cost of living in Scandinavian countries has increased by 50 percent compared with before the war.
    The burden on the working people of Western European countries has also been increasing due to the "Marshall Plan" and the "North Atlantic Treaty" and the "Mutual Defense Assistance Act" that come with it. Due to these "covenants" and "mutual assistance laws," countries are greatly expanding their military preparations. In 1948, the military expenditures of the five countries of the Western European Union plus Italy, Denmark, and Norway reached 5.5 billion U.S. dollars. Last year, the military expenditures of the Marshallized countries have increased significantly. With the implementation of the "Mutual Defense Assistance Act," the figures for Western European military expenditures will be even larger, because according to the "bilateral agreements" of the law, Western European countries have been completely tied to the American war chariot. Moreover, the "military expert delegation" composed of officers of the U.S. Army, Navy, and Air Force, the State Department, and the representatives of the "Marshall Plan" executive agency--the Economic Cooperation Administration--has the right to "supervise" the defense of these countries, and the expenses of this delegation must be borne by the recipient countries. According to Red Star, for every dollar the United States spends on military "aid," Western European countries will inevitably spend five to six times the cost. These burdens naturally fall on the working people. This is also the "gift" of the "Marshall Plan." In addition, countries such as France, Italy, Belgium, and Norway, which have received American military "aid," have also been assigned the task of providing American cannon fodder.
    This is how the people of Western Europe have benefited from the "Marshall Plan."
    From the above, people can see that the "Marshall Plan" represents robber-style, imperialist-style "aid." The result of this "aid" is the loss of the sovereignty and economic independence of the recipient country, and the increase in the suffering of the people. People can see that the "Marshall Plan" and the internationalist economic cooperation relationship between the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries are essentially completely different things. The former aims at economic enslavement and plunder, as well as the political and military control that comes with it, while the latter aims at helping fraternal countries to quickly embark on the road of economic development.

　　“马歇尔计划”给西欧人民带来了什么？
　　丁明
    杜鲁门政府为挽救美国的经济危机而于一九四八年四月间推行的所谓“马歇尔计划”，到现在已经快两年了。尽管“马歇尔计划”的主持人及其欧洲仆从们大事渲染，说什么该计划的目的在于“复兴欧洲经济”，但近两年来的事实却表明西欧各国的经济困难愈陷愈深，人民的生活越来越坏。
    目前，西欧的马歇尔化国家正发生日益加剧的产品滞销、生产减低、失业增长与美元短缺的严重危机。这与东欧人民民主国家因获得苏联的真诚援助而欣欣向荣，并迅速走上社会主义建设之路的情形，成为一个鲜明的对照。
    美国的垄断资本通过杜鲁门政府，实施“马歇尔计划”的真正目的，是十分明显的。他们利用欧洲小伙计们的战后衰败与困难，以“援助”和“赠予”的方法来奴役西欧各国，并控制西欧市场，把西欧变为美国的经济殖民地。与此同时，他们在马歇尔化国家内逐渐树立其政治与军事的支配权，使后者完全服从于美国的战争政策。“北大西洋公约”及基于这一公约的“军事联防互助法”的签订，已进一步确定了马歇尔化国家对美国的从属关系。
    “马歇尔计划”的掠夺性
    一九四八年四月二日美国国会所通过的“马歇尔计划”法案本身，充分显示出它的掠夺性。
    该法案规定“受援国”必须接受下述丧失国家独立主权的条件：由美国派出代表团，负责监督拨款用途，各国用款事先均须取得美国代表的批准；指定某国专门生产对美国有利的某项原料，不得生产对美国有竞争性的商品；西欧十六国不得与苏联及东南欧人民民主国家进行正当贸易；美援物品百分之五十须由美国船只装运；“受援国”须供给美国各种“战略物资”，并保护美国私人投资及开发权利等等。
    不仅如此，美国还规定了：“受援国”必须先分别与美国缔结“双边协定”，然后才能获得“援助”。而“双边协定”则是美国为了各个击破西欧各国的一个重要手段，其中所规定的受“援”条件更为繁苛。举法美“双边协定”为例，除上述一般条件外，更包括下列屈辱性的条款：法国允许美国有自由取得“战略物资”之权；法国须将某些工业发展计划（特别是煤业等）交由美国的经合总署批准；美国有要求法郎贬值之权；法国政府必须执行日内瓦及哈瓦那会议所制定的贸易政策等。
    所谓日内瓦和哈瓦那会议，就是美国发起的于一九四七年四月及一九四八年十一月分别在日内瓦及哈瓦那举行讨论“国际贸易组织”的会议，会议的结果是通过所谓“国际贸易组织宪章”，旨在便利美国推行其垄断世界市场的倾销政策，其中包括：取消关税壁垒，不得自由提高关税；订立最惠国条款，禁止管制进出口贸易与外汇；自由购取原料；废除英帝国优惠制等。这就是使各国市场为美国货开放。
    “马歇尔计划”使西欧生产下降
    “马歇尔计划”的“援助”给西欧带来了灾难性的后果。
    西欧各国的工业生产都因接受“马歇尔计划”的“援助”而下降了。在“马歇尔计划”实行的第一年--一九四八年，几乎所有西欧国家的工业产量的扩展率，都比一九四七年减低了。例如，法国减低了百分之六，挪威百分之六，比利时百分之十六。而在一九四九年头九个月，它们的生产又进一步地下降。
    在意大利，工业生产从一九四八年秋天开始下降，一九四九年头几个月的生产，比一九四七年低得多。意大利的造船业减产和破产了。因为加斯贝利政府遵奉马歇尔计划主持人的命令，一方面，向美国购买了一○三艘自由轮，另一方面，又拒绝了苏联的定货。结果，欧洲著名的都灵“菲亚特”轮船引擎工厂早在去年春天便已减产。而著名的“安萨尔都”造船厂因执行美国不准造船的命令，也已停止造船。至于热那亚造船厂，因奉命不准接受苏联定货，生产在一年前即已减少三分之二。“里沃诺”造船厂也因为同样的原因而削减生产。
    意大利复兴委员会（由各部代表组成）遵照不准自己生产、要向美国购买的受“援”条件，一方面奉经合总署之命下令“布列达”工厂减少电机生产，另一方面，又从美国购进该项机器。由于同样原因而减产的，还有出产钢板与钢轨的“伊利达”工厂；至“卡普罗尼”这个出产电汽机车与公共汽车的工厂，烟囱早已不冒烟了。
    比利时煤业的减产也是一个“马歇尔计划”灾难性的显著例子。该国的煤产在去年秋天已比战前减少百分之十二，但存煤仍旧月月增多。这是因为法国奉命以二十一美元一吨的高价购买美煤，并从美国控制的鲁尔输入煤炭，因而使比利时失去了法国的市场。同时，比利时的煤在意大利和北非，也因遇到美国煤炭的竞争，而卖不出去。同样的原因，在一九四八年，比利时的棉织品和线织品也比一九四七年低；而在一九三九年第二季，它的钢和铣铁产量已比同年上半年分别减低了百分之十三及二十五。
    在法国，飞机工业在减产或关门。因为法国政府奉命在它所属的一切航空公司中使用美国飞机。结果，在一九四七年每月可以生产一五九架飞机的法国飞机制造业，到了一九四八年已经减为平均每月九九架了。
    由于美国不供给“马歇尔计划”下所应供给的原料，以及受“援”条件中规定美“援”物品的百分之五十须由美国轮船运输，法国的造船业就由平常每年造二十五万吨，减产至去年的十三万吨左右了。
    更惨的是法国的电影业。根据勃鲁姆--贝纳斯的协定，美国影片在每十三个星期中应在法国放映九个星期。后来美电影协会主席约翰斯顿又利用“马歇尔计划”的便利，进一步使美国影片以倾销价格占有法国的影剧院，以致好莱坞的旧影片充斥法国，使得法国影片几乎完全被逐出市场。去年夏天，法国报界就已发出哀鸣说，法国的电影业已经“濒于灾难的边缘”，有的更宣称它实际上“已不存在”。好莱坞并利用法国明星失业的困境，把其中的名角运到美国去了。
    法国的汽车拖拉机和车床制造，则早已缩减生产。为什么？同样是因为依照美“援”条件，法国必须向美国购买上述机器。
    作为美国经纪人的英国，景况也并不比其他各国好些。在一九四八年，它的棉织品生产已比一九三七年低了百分之四十八；去年六月，兰开厦纺织中心的某些纺织企业，更因没有定货而倒闭。造船业的定货因受美“援”限制而减少了，轻便机器的定货去年夏天更比一九四八年缩减了百分之五十。其他如棉纺、羊毛制品、水电旋转摩托、电气设备、收音机等也都因被美国利用美援来竞争而相继减产。
    西欧各国工业的减产，是美国帝国主义所故意造成的。美国除了使用上述各种受“援”条件来窒息西欧各国工业外，更在“援助”它们的物品中故意不给予生产装备。例如，在一九四九年美国根据“马歇尔计划”给予欧洲各受“援”国的三十九亿七千七百六十万美元中，购买工业装备的款项仅有九千三百万美元。而在运给法国的大批物品中，生产装备只有百分之二。从这里更可以看出“马歇尔计划”的目的不是要“复兴”、而是要扼死西欧的经济。
    “马歇尔计划”使西欧贸易锐减
    “马歇尔计划”造成了西欧各国日益恶化的贸易情况。美国一方面利用“马歇尔计划”，将本国的剩余产品，极力向西欧倾销，另一方面，又竭力减少西欧货物的输入。例如，去年六月，美国输到西欧的商品是四亿零六百余万美元，而西欧对美国的输出则仅六千六百万美元。再以个别国家为例，去年三、四两月，美国输到荷兰的货物为荷兰输到美国的二十倍。去年六月，英国对美输出，更比一九四八年同期少了差不多两倍。美国不仅直接从本国运输大量商品去抢夺西欧的市场，而且经由扶植西德工业的方法，来争取西欧各国的市场。例如美国曾利用经合总署贷款二千万美元给西德皮革业的办法，来夺取法国的市场，结果使得法国的生皮与熟皮工业大受打击，并使法国的制鞋工业在受德国竞争后，销售量由一九三八年的六千三百万双减为一九四八年的四千万双。
    美国商品的倾销，还搅乱了西欧各国内部的贸易，并使其数量日趋减少。一九四八年，西欧各国间的贸易还不到一九三八年的百分之七十五。此外，美国禁止西欧各国与苏联及东南欧人民民主国家进行贸易。其目的有二：第一，是要使西欧不致脱离美国的羁绊，并继续以高价购买美国的粮食和原料；第二，是妄想借此阻止苏联及人民民主国家的经济迅速发展。大家知道，西欧各国与苏联及东南欧人民民主国家进行贸易至少有三大好处：一、苏联及人民民主国家的经济不断发展，西欧各国生产的工业装备可以在那里找到市场；二、它们有充分的粮食和原料可以供给西欧，而且价钱便宜；三，西欧各国不必用美元支付对东欧的贸易，可以节省美元开支。但在美国资本的命令下，西欧统治者拒绝与苏联及东南欧人民民主国家进行贸易，因此，东西欧间的贸易在“马歇尔计划”实施的第一年--一九四八年就开始锐减了，那一年的贸易量不及战前（一九三八年）的百分之四十二。据“欧洲经济合作局”估计，到一九五二年东西欧的贸易仍将低于一九三八年的总值八万万美元。由此可见，西欧因“马歇尔计划”所遭受的贸易损失，达到何种程度。
    由于西欧各国拒绝与东欧进行贸易，由于它们必须向美国购买所需要的东西，更由于它们对美贸易的巨额入超，形成了马歇尔化国家严重的美元亏空。据经合总署公报，一九四九--五○年度，西欧美元亏空将达四十五亿美元。而在“马歇尔计划”实施终了的一年--一九五二年，估计其亏空数目仍将达到三十亿美元。这一宣布充分揭穿了“马歇尔计划”执行人的谎言和西欧受援者的幻想。他们曾说：在一九五二年时，西欧经济将趋于“稳定自立”，并将治好慢性的美元亏空病。
    “马歇尔计划”使西欧人民生活恶化
    “马歇尔计划”既然使西欧各国工业凋疲、贸易下降，那么其必然的结果就是使西欧各国劳动人民的生活急剧恶化。这首先表现在失业人数的迅速增加上。估计马歇尔化各国的失业人数，连家属在内，目前约为二千五百万人。
    在“马歇尔计划”实行的约一年间，蕞尔小国的比利时的失业人数几乎增加了四倍；去年头九个月又比前年同期增加一倍多。现在失业者已有三十万人左右。
    在意大利，官方承认：在一九四八年秋天，失业人数即已达二百四十万，即比一九四七年秋天增加了百分之三十三。这就是说，“马歇尔计划”使失业的人数增加了五十万以上。意大利目前已有三百万人失业。
    西德占领当局发表的统计，显示一九四八年失业增加了百分之五十，去年头九个月比前年同期又增加一倍多。目前，该地失业人数已达二百万。
    英国虽然在战后维持着比战前多几倍的军队，但失业人数在去年十一月，也达到了三十二万四千余人。
    据法国官方的统计，法国靠失业救济金过活的人数，一九四八年一年间增加四倍。去年头九个月比前年头九个月又增加了一点六倍。劳动人民生活的急剧恶化，也表现在生活费用的不断高涨和劳动人民实际收入的减少上面。
    英国过去两年间物价的上涨，使得英国工人的实际工资减低了百分之三。法国劳动人民的购买力在去年九月以前的一年，已降低了百分之二十，而法郎贬值的后果尚未计算在内。目前西德工人的实际工资，尚不及一九三六年的百分之六十。据比利时官方统计，生活费用在一九四八年上涨了百分之二十。荷兰在同一期间，生活费用已上涨百分之十五。一九四九年，所有西欧马歇尔化国家的生活费用指数，都已比一九四八年上涨得多，就连土耳其也已上涨了百分之十一，奥地利增加了百分之三十七。而斯堪的纳维亚国家生活费用，则较战前增加了百分之五十。
    西欧各国劳动人民的负担，亦因“马歇尔计划”及与之俱来的“北大西洋公约”和“军事联防互助法”而日益加重。由于这些“公约”和“互助法”，各国均大事扩充军备。一九四八年，西欧联盟五国加上意、丹、挪三国的军费，即达五十五亿美元。去年，马歇尔化国家的军费，又有显著的增加。随着“军事联防互助法”的实行，西欧军备费用的数字将更为庞大，因为根据该法的“双边协定”，西欧各国已经完全被系在美国的兵车上。而且，美国海陆空军官、国务院及“马歇尔计划”执行机关--经合总署代表所组成的“军事专家代表团”有权去“监督”这些国家的国防，而这个代表团的经费必须由受援国负担。据红星报估计，美国每在军事“援助”上化一美元，西欧国家势必化五倍至六倍于此的代价。这些负担当然落在劳动人民身上。这也是“马歇尔计划”的“赠予”。此外，受美国军事“援助”的法、意、比、挪等国，还被分配了供给美国炮灰的任务。
    西欧人民受惠于“马歇尔计划”的就是如此。
    由上所述，人们可以看出：“马歇尔计划”代表强盗式的、帝国主义式的“援助”，这种“援助”的结果，就是受援国家主权和经济独立的丧失，就是人民灾难的增长。人们可以看出：“马歇尔计划”与苏联——人民民主国家之间的国际主义的经济合作关系，是在本质上完全不同的东西。前者的目的在于经济上的奴役和掠夺以及随之而来的政治上军事上的控制，而后者的目的则在于帮助各兄弟国家，迅速走上经济发展的道路。
