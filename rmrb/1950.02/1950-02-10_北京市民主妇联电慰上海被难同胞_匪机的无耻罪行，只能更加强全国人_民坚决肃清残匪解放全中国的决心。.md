　　Beijing Democratic Women's Federation
    Sends Condolences to Shanghai Compatriots Suffering Disaster
    The shameless crimes of the bandit planes can only strengthen the resolve of the people of the whole country to resolutely eliminate the remnant bandits and liberate all of China.
    [Beijing News] The Beijing Democratic Women's Federation issued a telegram of condolence to the compatriots in Shanghai who were bombed by the remnant bandits of the Kuomintang. The telegram reads as follows:
    We, representing one million women in Beijing, extend our deepest condolences to the compatriots from all walks of life in Shanghai who were frantically bombed by the remnant bandits of the Kuomintang, and express our condolences to the families of the deceased. The remnant bandits of the Kuomintang, with the direct assistance of American imperialists and Japanese aggressor elements, have wantonly bombed the new Shanghai of the people, causing the death and injury of more than a thousand compatriots. This kind of crime cannot conceal or save their inevitable collapse and demise; on the contrary, it will only strengthen the resolve of the people of the whole country to resolutely eliminate the remnant bandits and liberate all of China. We deeply know that the best way to prevent bombing and smoothly transition to peaceful construction is: people from all walks of life strengthen unity, step up production, and support the front lines, so that our People's Liberation Army can liberate Taiwan, Tibet, and Hainan Island as soon as possible, and thoroughly eliminate American imperialism and its running dogs, the remnant bandits of the Kuomintang, from the whole country. Only in this way can our lives and property be guaranteed. We believe that the compatriots in Shanghai will certainly be able to display collective heroism and, under the leadership of the East China Military and Political Committee and the Shanghai Municipal People's Government, overcome all difficulties and accomplish the great task of building the people's Shanghai. Your efforts will surely receive the support of the people of the whole country.

　　北京市民主妇联
    电慰上海被难同胞
    匪机的无耻罪行，只能更加强全国人  民坚决肃清残匪解放全中国的决心。
    【北京讯】北京市民主妇联发出通电慰问上海被国民党残匪轰炸的同胞，电文如下：
    我们代表北京市一百万妇女，向被国民党残匪疯狂轰炸的上海各界同胞致深切的慰问，并向死难者的家属致唁。国民党残匪在美帝国主义及日本侵略分子的直接帮助下，向人民的新上海大肆轰炸，造成千余同胞的死伤。这种罪行，不但不能掩饰或挽救他们必然崩溃和灭亡的命运，相反，只有更加强我全国人民坚决肃清残匪解放全国的决心。我们深深知道，防止轰炸和顺利转入和平建设的最好办法就是：各界人民加强团结，加紧生产，支援前线，使我们的解放军早日解放台湾、西藏、海南岛，从全国范围内彻底肃清美帝国主义及其走狗国民党残匪，只有这样，我们的生命财产才有保障。我们相信，上海的同胞们定能发挥集体的英雄主义，在华东军政委员会和上海市人民政府的领导下，战胜一切困难，完成建设人民上海的伟大任务。你们的努力，必将获得全国人民的支持。
