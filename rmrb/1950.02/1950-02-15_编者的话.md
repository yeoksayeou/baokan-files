　　Editor's Note
    At present, local newspapers in various parts of our country generally have made considerable achievements. However, most newspapers do not adequately reflect local life, and their criticism and self-criticism of local life are still poor. Therefore, the influence of newspapers among the masses is still not large enough. This is sufficient to show that without rich, vivid, and thoughtful reporting on local life, local newspapers cannot be welcomed by the vast local readership. The "Resolution on Newspapers of the Eighth Congress of the CPSU (Bolsheviks)" and the "Pravda" editorial "Give All Help to Local Newspapers," translated and published in this issue, are of great significance for improving the situation of local newspapers in our country. The attached "Excerpts from Letters from Four Soviet Local Newspaper Editors to the "Pravda" Editorial Department" can also help Chinese journalists learn working methods that are closely integrated with the lives of the local people. It is hoped that responsible comrades of local leading organs and newspaper offices will pay attention to this and use it as an important reference for improving the work of local newspapers.

　　编者的话
    目前我国各地的地方报纸，一般是有不少成绩的。但多数报纸对地方生活的反映不够，关于地方生活中的批评与自我批评，还作得较差，因此报纸在群众中的影响也还不够大。这足以说明，没有关于地方生活的丰富的、生动的、有思想的报道，地方报纸就不可能为当地广大读者所欢迎。本刊本期译载的《联共八次大会关于报纸的决议》及真理报社论《给地方报纸以一切的帮助》，对于改进我国地方报纸情况有重要的意义。附载《四个苏联地方报纸编辑写给真理报编辑部的信摘录》，也可以帮助我国新闻工作者学习和当地人民生活密切结合的工作方法。希望各地领导机关以及报社的负责同志加以注意，作为改善各地报纸工作的重要参考。
