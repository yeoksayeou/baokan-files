　　Suburban District Work Committee Convenes Meeting
    Preparing for This Year's Agricultural Production
    Decides to Vigorously Dredge Rivers, Solve Fertilizer Difficulties, and Prevent Livestock Plague
    [This newspaper dispatch] To make a success of the 1950 agricultural production plan, the Suburban District Work Committee of the Beijing Municipal People's Government has held a series of preparatory meetings, inviting relevant agencies and experts to discuss suburban water conservancy, fertilizer, livestock disease prevention, and other issues. Regarding water conservancy, according to the report by Zhou Fengming, Director of the Suburban Committee, at the meeting, there are more than ten rivers of varying sizes in the suburbs, distributed across various districts. However, due to years of disrepair and last year's excessive rainfall, 300,000 mu of the suburban area's more than one million mu of land were flooded. This year, to prevent floods and increase paddy fields, these rivers must be dredged and managed. After discussion at the meeting, everyone unanimously agreed that a Capital Water Conservancy Committee should be established to conduct unified leadership. It was decided that the Suburban Committee and the Municipal Sanitation Engineering Bureau would first be responsible for drafting an organizational plan and submitting it to higher authorities for approval. In addition, it was also decided to recruit water conservancy specialists in various suburban districts to organize water conservancy management committees. Regarding the issue of dredging rivers and straightening channels, it was decided to first arrange surveys. The Municipal Sanitation Engineering Bureau will dispatch six people, the Water Conservancy Bureau of the Central Ministry of Agriculture will dispatch two people, and more than 50 students from the civil engineering departments of Peking University and Tsinghua University will form three survey teams to carry out the work. Currently, sixteen students from Peking University have departed to survey the Fenghe River in Nan Yuan.
    Regarding fertilizer, the issue of fertilizer shortage was discussed and resolved. According to estimates, suburban cultivated land requires approximately 265,000 tons of fertilizer annually. The annual output of fertilizer and substitute fertilizer in the city and suburbs is approximately 104,000 tons, which is still half of the actual need. Therefore, in addition to unified supply of dried manure, ditch mud, and river mud, it was decided that the Suburban Committee would mobilize farmers to accumulate and compress fertilizer. The Agricultural Research Institute was also asked to help study increasing the use of suburban fertilizer and promoting the use of other fertilizers, such as soybean cake, pig hair, oil cake, and black beans. In addition, it was decided that the Municipal Sanitation Engineering Bureau's Manure Management Office would collaborate with the Fertilizer Procurement Committee to conduct planned management of manure and the supply of fertilizer to the suburbs, to avoid panic buying. Regarding the method of using human urine as a substitute fertilizer advocated by the Agricultural Research Institute, it was decided not to promote it on a large scale this year due to the lack of such habits among farmers in the past, and the difficulty in purchasing transportation and storage equipment for the time being. Only state-owned farms will conduct pilot projects first.
    Regarding livestock, in addition to transportation capacity, each large animal in the suburbs bears the burden of more than 60 mu of land on average. Last year, cattle and horses suffered from anthrax, pigs suffered from hog cholera and septicemia, and there was a severe and highly contagious chicken plague; the mortality rate was quite alarming, which deserves serious attention. To strengthen livestock disease prevention work, the meeting decided to establish a Suburban Livestock Disease Prevention Committee to provide unified leadership for livestock disease prevention work. It was also decided to transfer 120 staff members from various departments and students from the Agricultural University to do a rush job, striving to complete livestock disease prevention injections universally by the end of March. The required vaccines and serums will be resolved through consultation with the Animal Husbandry and Veterinary Bureau of the Ministry of Agriculture and the North China Agricultural Research Institute. In addition, the Huabei [North China] Agricultural University Veterinary Station is preparing to run veterinary training classes in the suburbs and Chengguan Xiang [areas surrounding a city gate], focusing on reforming old-style veterinarians. The Suburban Committee decided to give it strong support and assistance. The Huabei Agricultural University Veterinary Station is currently drafting specific measures.

　　京郊区工作委员会召开会议
    准备今年农业生产
    决定大力疏浚河道，解决肥料困难，防止畜瘟
    【本报讯】为做好一九五○年农业生产计划，北京市人民政府郊区工作委员会连续召开准备会议，邀请有关机关和专家座谈郊区水利、肥料、家畜防疫等问题。水利方面，据郊委会周凤鸣主任在会议上报告，郊区有大小河流十余条，分布于各区。但多因年久失修及去年雨量过大，郊区百余万亩土地被淹三十万亩。今年要防止水灾，并增加水田，就要疏浚和管理这些河道。会上经过讨论，大家一致认为应当成立首都水利委员会，以便进行统一领导。并决定先由郊委会与卫生工程局负责拟定组织草案，送呈上级机关批准。此外，并决定在各郊区吸收水利专门人材，组织水利管理委员会。关于疏浚河流和整理渠道问题，决定先布置测量，由卫生工程局派出六人，中央农业部水利局派出两人，会同北大、清华两校土木系同学五十余人，分成三个测量队进行工作。现北大十六名同学已出发去南苑凤河测量。
    肥料方面，讨论和解决了肥荒问题。按郊区耕地每年需要肥料约二十六万五千吨，城内和郊区年产肥料和代肥料约有十万零四千吨，距实际需要尚差一半。因此，除统一供给粪干及沟泥、河泥外，决定由郊委会动员农民进行积肥、压肥。并商请农业研究所帮助研究增加郊区肥料的使用，及推广利用其它的肥料，如豆饼、猪毛、油饼、黑豆等。此外，并决定由市府卫生工程局粪便事务所协同肥料收购委员会进行有计划的管理粪便与郊区肥料的供应，避免抢购现象。关于农业研究所提倡的人尿代肥办法，因过去农民无此习惯，且运输与储存设备一时难以购置，故今年不拟大量推广，仅先由国营农场试办。
    牲畜方面，郊区牲畜除运输力外，每一大牲畜平均负担六十多亩地。去年牛马曾发生过炭疽病、猪霍乱败血病及剧烈传染的鸡瘟；死亡率相当惊人，值得严重注意。为加强牲畜防疫工作，会议决定成立郊区家畜防疫委员会，统一领导家畜防疫工作。并决定抽调各部门工作人员与农业大学学生一百二十人，做突击工作。争取在三月底普遍完成牲畜防疫注射。所用疫苗与血清，商请农业部畜牧兽医局与华北农业研究所设法解决。此外，华大兽医站准备在郊区与城关厢办理兽医训练班，集中改造旧式兽医。郊委会决定予以大力支持和帮助。现华大兽医站正在拟订具体办法。
