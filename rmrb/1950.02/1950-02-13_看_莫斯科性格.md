　　On "Moscow Character"
　　Xie Tao
　　After I saw "Moscow Character," I heard people talking about the play saying, "I didn't expect that even after more than thirty years since the founding of the Soviet Union, the responsible factory director still has such shortcomings." From the opposite perspective of this statement, it means that the Soviet person they imagined had no shortcomings or made any mistakes. Now, seeing Podopov in the play also having shortcomings and making mistakes in his work, they are surprised. This shows a subjective fantasy or illusion. A living person in a real society, dealing with all sorts of problems in life, can never be perfect in everything. But the issue isn't whether he has shortcomings or makes mistakes, but rather the role and nature of his shortcomings or mistakes, especially his attitude towards the mistakes he makes. The Soviet people didn't fall from the sky. Although they have undergone decades of revolutionary struggle and education, and they live in a free and happy society, they are tirelessly working for truth, for the motherland, and for the international proletarian cause. They have cultivated the most excellent and glorious noble character of humankind, which has never existed in history. However, the old ideas accumulated and left over by history cannot be completely eliminated in a short period. From Podopov, we see how the people of a great socialist country are training themselves and bravely advancing. Advancing is not just an empty phrase but means in every specific task, in thought, criticizing and abandoning the old things that hinder progress, and consolidating and developing new things that promote the progress of things. Yes, Podopov has shortcomings and made mistakes in his work, but he is a Communist Party member of the All-Union Communist Party. In addition to actively taking responsibility for his work, he resolutely and courageously corrects his mistakes, especially when he has made them. This is the new human character cultivated in a glorious and splendid society—the Bolshevik character. Podopov is worthy of our love because he inspires and encourages us: only those who truly love the truth and dare to fight for it are those who dare to correct their mistakes!
　　Chinese society is one that is most abundant in petty-bourgeois "sentimentality" and has the deepest family concepts. Within the revolutionary ranks, it is not entirely uncommon for people to abandon principled struggles for the sake of so-called "sentimentality" and "family concepts." From "Moscow Character," we see that Galina, Podopov's wife, painfully exposed and criticized Podopov's mistakes and shortcomings at the district committee meeting for the sake of the Party's strict principles; other comrades, such as the factory branch secretary, also gave him sincere and stern criticism. We should learn from this. Through this play, we should connect it with ourselves to criticize the remnants of family concepts and the dirty things of petty-bourgeois "sentimentality."
　　Perhaps some people will wonder if Galina's criticism of her husband will affect their love? Isn't the fact proving that their love has suffered setbacks because of this criticism? Our answer is: for a Communist couple, it is extremely wrong and the worst thing if either party's love is harmed or even divorced because their loved one has criticized them. Galina is right. She is not only doing it for the interests of the Party, the interests of the people, and the strict principles of the Party, but she also loves Podopov most sincerely. For the person we love, we shouldn't let their mistakes develop and expand without correcting them, or even "love their shortcomings" as we often heard in the past, which is a typical petty-bourgeois sentiment. We, as revolutionaries and Communist Party members, should oppose this wrong attitude. Galina, precisely because she loves her own loved one, wants him to work better for the motherland and the people. Therefore, she helps him drive away the enemy in his thoughts according to the standards required by the Party for a Party member. This is the correct attitude that a true Communist Party member takes towards love. Let all our revolutionary couples learn from "Moscow Character"! Podopov's attitude after being criticized by his lover was wrong, but he finally overcame it and defeated his mistake. This is another manifestation of Podopov's excellent quality of daring to correct his mistakes. We should take his mistakes as a lesson from the past, and we should dare to learn from his excellent qualities.
　　It's easy to call for criticism and self-criticism, but it's not easy to truly withstand the test. Another excellent quality that Podopov showed in this matter is that he doesn't just shout it out loud. After he accepted the criticism from the district committee and his comrades, and after he realized his mistakes, he immediately and without hesitation accepted the decision of the district committee. He simply said, "The Party's decision is law to me." Then he took practical actions to correct his mistakes and finally completed the task assigned to him by the Party without affecting the factory's original plan. This spirit of correcting mistakes with actions is worth learning from. Here, the district committee secretary is also particularly worthy of our learning. After Podopov accepted the criticism and the Party's decision, her attitude was not to have a cadre verbally scold himself in all aspects, but to encourage and praise his Communist Party member's self-esteem and his conscious of work and discipline, to correct his mistakes in concrete actions, and to consolidate and realize the achieved success of helping, educating, and advancing a comrade. This is a concrete manifestation of the excellent leadership methods of the Bolsheviks and is what every revolutionary and leader should learn.
　　Galina criticized Podopov, saying, "I feel that you are slowly losing your sense of new things" and "gradually becoming a narrow-minded pragmatist." We should connect this with ourselves to examine whether we are also slowly losing our sense of new things? Are we also gradually becoming narrow-minded pragmatists? This is not without factual basis. I have heard many comrades laugh at themselves for losing their sense of new things and falling into the quagmire of bureaucracy. Don't just stop at self-mockery or mocking others. This kind of empty, indifferent self-mockery or mocking others is the beginning of ideological and emotional numbness and rigidity, a dangerous beginning! There are two kinds of deviations within our revolutionary ranks: one is a dogmatic deviation, and the other is an empiricist deviation. A person who is guilty of dogmatism or empiricism does not have a keen sense of new things. Dogmatists look at the "articles" and cannot see the existing problems in reality; empiricists carry a bag of narrow experiences on their backs, forgetting that reality is moving forward and clinging to old working methods and leadership methods. These will all cause people to lose their sense of new things. After we have seen "Moscow Character," we should treat it as a textbook, and we should learn from it well. Indeed, this is a good play that "cadres must see."

### 看“莫斯科性格”

　　看“莫斯科性格”
    谢韬
    当我看了“莫斯科性格”以后，听到人谈起这剧时这样说：“想不到苏联建国已三十多年，负责的厂长还有这样的毛病。”从这句话的反面来看，就是说他想象中的苏联人，是没有一点缺点，不犯一点错误的，现在从剧中一看到波达波夫也有缺点，在工作中也犯错误，于是就惊讶起来了。这表现出一种主观的空想或幻想。一个在现实社会中活生生的人，他处理生活中各色各样问题，绝不能说什么都是十全十美的。但问题不是在他有或没有缺点或错误，而是在他的缺点或错误所起的作用及其性质，尤其是他对待所犯错误所采取的态度。苏联人不是从天上掉下来的，虽然他们经过了几十年革命斗争的锻炼和教育，他们生活在自由幸福的社会里，他们不懈怠地在为真理，为祖国，为国际无产阶级事业而努力工作，他们已培养起一种历史上从没有过的人类的最优秀最光辉的崇高品格，但是他们对历史所积压遗留下来的旧思想，不是在短时间内就可以扫除得干干净净的。从波达波夫身上，我们看到一个伟大社会主义国家的人民，是怎样在进行锻炼自己和勇敢的前进。前进不是一句空话，而是在每一具体的工作中，思想中，批判抛弃旧的阻碍进步的东西，巩固和发展新的促使事物进步的东西。是的，波达波夫有缺点，工作中犯了错误，但是他是一个联共共产党员，他除了积极负责的工作，尤其是当他有了错误时，他坚决勇敢地改正错误。这是在光辉灿烂的社会中所培养起来的新的人类性格——布尔什维克的性格。波达波夫是值得我们热爱的，因为从他身上使我们得到启示和鼓励：只有真正热爱真理，勇于为真理奋斗的人，才是勇于改正错误的人！
    中国这个社会，是一个最富于小市民的“人情”和家族观念最深的社会。在革命阵营里，为了所谓“人情”及“家族观念”而放弃原则性的斗争的事不是完全没有的。从“莫斯科性格”中，我们看到葛利尼娃——波达波夫的妻子，为了党的严肃的原则性，在区委会上沉痛地揭露了批评了波达波夫的错误和缺点；其他的同志，如工厂支部书记等也对他作了诚恳的严正的批评。我们应该好好的学习。通过这个剧，我们应联系自己来批判过去残余的家族观念与小市民的“人情”这些脏的东西。
    也许有人会想起，葛利尼娃这样批评她的丈夫，是不是会影响他们的爱情呢？事实不是证明他们因为这个批评而在爱情上发生波折吗？我们的回答是：一对共产党员的夫妇，任何一方如果因为自己的爱人批评了自己，而使爱情受到损害，甚至离婚，是极端错误和最糟糕的事情。葛利尼娃是对的，她不仅是为了党的利益，人民的利益，严肃的党的原则性，而且她是最真诚的爱波达波夫的。我们对自己所爱的人，不是他有了错误不改而让它发展扩大下去，甚至如过去常听到的连对方的“缺点也爱”的那种典型小资产阶级的感情。我们一个革命者，一个共产党员是应该反对这种错误的态度的。葛利尼娃，正因为爱她自己的爱人，愿意他更好为祖国为人民工作，所以根据党对一个党员要求的尺度来帮助他驱掉他思想中的敌人，这才是一个真正的共产党员对爱情所采取的正确态度。让我们所有的革命夫妇向“莫斯科性格”学习吧！波达波夫在被他爱人批评后所采取的态度，是错误的，但是他终于克服了，战胜了他的错误。这又是波达波夫在勇于改正错误的优秀品质的表现。他的错误，我们要引为前车之鉴；他的优秀品质，我们要勇于学习。
    批评与自我批评叫得嘴响是容易的，但是真正经得住考验却是不容易的事情。波达波夫从这事所表现的另一优秀品质，就是不在口头上叫得嘴响。当他接受了区委会及同志们的批评后，在他认识了自己的错误，他马上没有犹豫的接受区委会的决定，他只简单的说：“党的决定对我就是法律。”于是他以实际行动来改正自己的错误，终于在不影响工厂原订计划下，完成了党给他的任务。这种用行动来改正错误的精神，是值得学习的。这里，区委书记也是特别值得我们学习的。当波达波夫接受了批评及接受党的决定后，她的态度，不是要一个干部从口头上各方面来责骂自己，而是鼓励表扬他的共产党员的自尊心，工作与纪律的自觉，在具体行动中来改正错误，巩固实现对一个同志帮助教育而进步的既得成绩。这是布尔什维克的优良领导方法的具体表现，是每一个革命者与领导者所要学习的。
    葛利尼娃批评波达波夫说：“我感觉到你是慢慢的失掉了你对新鲜事物的感觉”而“渐渐的变成一个思想狭隘的事务家”。我们应联系自己来检查，我们是不是也慢慢的失掉新鲜事物的感觉呢？是不是也渐渐变成一个思想狭隘的事务家呢？这不是没有事实根据的，我曾听到好些同志嘲笑自己失去新鲜事物的感觉及陷在事务主义的泥坑里。不要止于自我嘲笑或嘲笑别人吧，这种空虚的冷漠的自我嘲笑或嘲笑别人，是思想上，感情上麻痹、僵化的开始，一个危险的开始！在我们革命阵营内部是存在两种偏向的，一种是教条主义的偏向，一种是经验主义的偏向。一个犯有教条主义或经验主义的人，都不是对新鲜事物有敏锐的感觉的。教条主义者两眼望着“条文”，看不见现实存在的问题；经验主义者背着一背狭隘的经验，忘记了现实在向前发展，固守着陈旧的工作方法与领导方法。这些，都会是使人失掉对新鲜事物的感觉的。在我们看了“莫斯科性格”后，我们应当把它当作课本，我们应好好的向它学习。的确，这是一个“干部必看”的好剧。
