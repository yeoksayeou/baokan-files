Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 3rd: TASS Moscow dispatch: On the occasion of the 25th anniversary of the founding of the Turkmen Republic, all newspapers prominently published the letter from the Turkmen people to Stalin, and the decree of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union awarding orders and medals to workers in industry, agriculture, science, culture and art of the Turkmen Republic. Forty-six Turkmen people received the Order of Lenin, four hundred and seventeen received the Order of the Red Banner of Labor, eight hundred and twenty-four received the Order of Honor, five hundred and eighty-seven received the Medal for Valiant Labor, and five hundred and fifty-seven received the Medal for Labor Excellence.

The workers, collective farmers, and intellectuals of Turkmenistan wrote a letter to Stalin to pay their respects and to wish long life to the great leader who opened the road to a free and happy life for the Turkmen people and all the nationalities of the Soviet Union.

The letter stated: "The Turkmen Republic has only been established for twenty-five years, but this short period has become a historical era in the life of the Turkmen people. Now, socialist industry accounts for more than 70 percent of the national economy of Turkmenistan, and the output of various industrial sectors has generally increased thirteen times compared with 1924. Previously, Turkmenistan only had some small-scale private capitalist semi-handicraft enterprises, with only about 3,000 workers, including the Trans-Caspian Railway. During the successive Five-Year Plans, 352 large enterprises have been newly built and completely re-equipped, with tens of thousands of workers working there. New departments have been established in industry: oil refining, chemical, textile, clothing, weaving, duplicating machines, glass, building materials, etc.

Turkmenistan was once a poor and fragmented agricultural region with nomadic livestock breeding, and hundreds of thousands of tenant farmers and poor peasants were cruelly exploited. Now, huge, modernly equipped state farms and collective farms are thriving, uniting the free laborers of socialist agriculture and livestock breeding. Now, dozens of new canals for irrigation crisscross the desert, turning it into flourishing orchards and vast cotton fields. The Turkmen Republic has become a major supplier of long-staple cotton in the Soviet Union. Socialist livestock breeding also has great importance in our country.

Before the October Revolution, no more than one percent of the Turkmen people could read and write. This year, universal seven-year education will be implemented, with more than 200,000 primary and secondary school students, and about 100,000 young men and women studying in six higher education institutions and thirty secondary specialized schools. Turkmenistan has become a country where all the people can read and write, and has a highly developed culture. The republic has 330 libraries, 315 city clubs, and 850 collective farm clubs, more than 500 reading rooms, cultural centers, and folk art stations.

On this significant day, the Turkmen people solemnly assure you, Stalin: We will never be satisfied with the victories we have already achieved, but will work selflessly to strive to complete the post-war Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule, and contribute all our strength to building communism in our country and further strengthening the power of our motherland in safeguarding world peace."

　　报告二十五年来建设成就
    土库曼人民上书斯大林
    保证争取提前完成五年计划
    【新华社北京三日电】塔斯社莫斯科讯：在土库曼共和国成立二十五周年纪念日时，各报均以显著地位刊载土库曼人民致斯大林的信，和苏联最高苏维埃主席团授予土库曼共和国工业、农业、科学、文化与艺术工作者以勋章和奖章的法令。土库曼人有四十六人获得列宁勋章，四百一十七人获得劳动红旗勋章，八百二十四人获得荣誉奖章，五百八十七人获得勇敢劳动奖章，五百五十七人获得劳动优异奖章。
    土库曼的工人、集体农民和知识分子写信向斯大林致敬，并祝为土库曼人民及苏联各民族打开了自由幸福生活之路的伟大领袖万寿无疆。
    该信写道：“土库曼共和国成立了仅二十五年，但这一短暂时期在土库曼人民的生活中却成为历史性的时代。现在，社会主义的工业占土库曼国民经济的百分之七十以上，而且各工业部门的产量，普遍比一九二四年增加了十三倍。以前，土库曼只有一些小规模的私人的资本主义的半手工业方式的企业，工人连外里海铁路在内，不过近三千人。在历次五年计划时期，已新建和完全重新装备了三百五十二个大企业，有成千上万的工人在工作着。工业中已建立了新的部门：炼油、化学、纺织、服装、编织、复印机、玻璃、建筑材料等等。
    土库曼曾经是一个穷困的四分五裂的农业地区，有游牧式的牲畜饲养业，数十万雇农与贫农被残酷地剥削着。而现在，巨大的现代化装备的国营农场和集体农场正欣欣向荣，并团结了社会主义农业和牲畜饲养业的自由劳动者。现在，几十条新的供灌溉用的运河横过沙漠，把它变成繁盛的果园和广阔的棉田。土库曼共和国已成为苏联的长纤维棉花的主要供应地。社会主义牲畜饲养业在我国也有着极大的重要性。
    在十月革命以前，土库曼能读能写的人不超过百分之一。而今年，将实行普遍的七年制教育，小学和中学的学生有二十多万，在六所高等教育机关和三十所中等专门学校学习的男女青年约有十万人。土库曼已成为人民全都能读能写的国家，并且有着高度发展的文化。共和国有三百三十个图书馆，三百十五个城市俱乐部和八百五十个集体农场俱乐部，五百多个阅览室、文化之家和民间艺术站。
    在这一有重大意义的日子，土库曼人民向您——斯大林郑重保证：我们决不满足于已有的胜利，而要忘我地努力以争取提前完成战后五年计划，以全力贡献给在我国建设共产主义，并进一步加强我们祖国维护世界和平事业的威力。”
