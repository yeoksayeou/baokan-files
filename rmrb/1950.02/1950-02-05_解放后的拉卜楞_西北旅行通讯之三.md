　　Liberated Labrang
　　--Northwest Travelogue No. 3
　　(Our reporter Li Wen)
　　In September last year, the People's Liberation Army marched into the Great Northwest. Lanzhou was liberated. The Ma bandit troops were driven away in headlong flight. The PLA's victorious prestige greatly encouraged the people of the Labrang Tibetan area who had been weeping under the iron heel of the Chiang-Ma bandit gang for decades. When the PLA had just advanced to Linxia (200 li from Labrang), they sent their three representatives to Linxia to contact the PLA. After the PLA entered Tumen Pass (the boundary between Han, Hui, and Tibetan peoples), they were repeatedly stopped by welcoming crowds. Tibetan people competed to present "hada" (a Tibetan ritual, i.e., a piece of silk), fox furs, musk, and other gifts to the PLA. The PLA accepted the sincerity of the Tibetan people and politely declined their gifts. In those days, the quiet mountain road from Linxia to Labrang was very lively, with a continuous stream of Tibetan compatriots welcoming the PLA. The people of the Tibetan area welcomed the PLA like welcoming relatives, crowding around them and escorting them into the Tibetan area.

　　Their Hearts are the Same as Ours
　　In Labrang, I visited poor farmers and herdsmen, educated youths, and working women among the Tibetan people, and also visited lamas in the monasteries. In the short period of more than two months after liberation, a clear sense of love and hate has developed in the minds of Tibetans from all walks of life.
　　When talking with several lamas, including A Lan, they told me: "Ma Bufang demanded horses, cattle, grass, and fodder from the Tibetan people every day. If they didn't obey, he would kill people. The Communist Party and the People's Liberation Army drove away Ma Bufang, and everyone, young and old, says it's a good thing." The working people saw the fundamental changes in society from the daily actions of the Communist Party and the People's Government workers. Danu, who had been a hired laborer for wealthy families for many years, told me: "When the Kuomintang came to Labrang, they were looking for the security commander or the county magistrate, and they never cared about the poor people. We would hide far away when we saw Kuomintang officers and soldiers. After the Communist Party came, the people felt relieved. We can talk and laugh with the Communist Party cadres. The cadres also ask about our well-being and care about our food and clothing." An old poor Tibetan woman named Shanu Jiao in Shangtawa went to the county government to sue someone over a rent dispute. At first, she was worried that she would not be able to enter the "yamen" because she had "no money to give as a gift." However, to Shanu Jiao's surprise, she was warmly received by Deputy County Magistrate Zhang (sent from the old liberated areas), and the dispute was resolved very reasonably. She praised everywhere: "The new government is really good. In the past, how could I have seen the county magistrate without money!" Then she said, "The cadres sent by the Communist Party are of one heart with us Tibetan people!"

　　The Beginning of a New Era for the Tibetan People
　　After the takeover of the various old agencies in Labrang was completed, democratic elections were held successively in six townships, including Gonghe Township and Demonstration Town, in October and November. Village meetings and township representative meetings were held in various townships and villages to elect village government members, township representatives, township government members, and representatives to attend the county-wide people's representative conference. The People's Government explained the policies to the masses and allowed the people to freely discuss and choose their own representatives. The election encouraged the broad masses of Tibetans. Many Tibetans brought "tsampa" tea, rode horses, crossed mountains and rivers, and came from dozens of miles away to participate in the township election. They said excitedly: "In the past, we ordinary people had no place to speak. This meeting is really 'Shag, Shag' (very good meaning)." The following figures show the grand occasion of the Tibetan people's participation in the election: There were 2,883 people in Gonghe Township, and 2,140 voters (890 men and 1,250 women); the actual number of people who participated in the election was 657 men and 859 women, a total of 1,516 people, accounting for 70.8% of the total number of voters.
　　Through democratic elections, the status of the working people has been unprecedentedly improved. For example, among the 37 township representatives in Gonghe Township, 30 were outstanding members of the working people. Sahar Village used to be a small and weak tribe with a low status. In this election, Daga, who came from a hired worker background in the village, was not only elected as a member of the township government but also elected as a representative to attend the county-wide people's representative conference. All the Tibetans in the village were overjoyed, believing that the Communist Party had brought them happiness. Wang Satan, another newly elected administrative village director in the village, is also a poor Tibetan.

　　The Consciousness of Tibetan Youth is Rapidly Improving
　　Tibetan youth appear more keenly to accept new things. In less than a month after Labrang's liberation, more than 80 educated youths and militiamen requested to join the New Democratic Youth League. The Tibetan youths in the militia headquarters are mostly children of farmers and herdsmen. They had no habit of attending meetings before, let alone giving opinions to each other; now, they have started a democratic life and are learning to use the weapon of criticism and self-criticism.
　　The Tibetan primary school in Labrang, which has been running for more than ten years, sometimes graduates only one or two Tibetan students each term, and the most it has never exceeded seven; however, in the two months after liberation, more than 60 Tibetan youths (including more than ten women) have gone to Lanzhou City to study, which clearly shows that the consciousness of Tibetan youth is rapidly improving. Yi Danjia, originally from Qinghai, ran to Labrang to work as a cook for six years to escape being conscripted by Ma bandit troops when he was a teenager. Now he has automatically joined the ranks of the revolution and has gone to Lanzhou to study. He excitedly told his friend: "I know that the Communist Party is truly working for the benefit of the Tibetan people. I must work hard. The day for the Tibetan people to stand up has come."

　　I Saw the Wisdom of the Tibetan People
　　Speaking of the Tibetans scattered in the border areas, some people used to think that the Tibetan area has closed transportation, underdeveloped production, backward culture, and simple Tibetan life, so they imagined that the Tibetans are "ignorant and ignorant." After 20 days of in-depth visits to the Tibetan people, I deeply feel that this view is very wrong. It is true that the economy and culture in the Tibetan area are very backward. Except for the lamas in the monasteries, the vast majority of Tibetans, regardless of men or women, have no access to culture. However, in liberated Labrang, I have seen the wisdom of the Tibetan working people on many occasions. Xilai, a small attendant of the Xiahe Nationalities Democratic Promotion Association, who just took off his ragged old sheepskin jacket and put on a gray uniform, is a child of a poor Tibetan. He is studying Tibetan letters carefully on the table. In just two or three days, he has learned to write and read all 30 letters. He can also understand some common Chinese greetings and learn simple etiquette for receiving guests. I once went to the home of a Tibetan named Sanu (a poor Tibetan in his thirties) who had just started working. When I went in, he and his wife Roumu Ji, as well as Roumu Ji's cousin Jin Zao, were practicing Tibetan. On the newly ordered rough paper notebooks, there were crookedly drawn pieces of letters. Sanu said with a smile: "Before liberation, we were all illiterate old roughs. Roumu Ji learns the fastest. In just three to five days, she learned all the letters and has started to learn pinyin." Even more surprising, Sanu has only been close to the staff for more than half a month, and he has understood many revolutionary truths. He is full of confidence and enthusiasm for the complete liberation of the Tibetan area. After a detailed conversation, I realized the reason why Sanu and his wife are so enthusiastic about learning. Sanu's plan is: The Communist Party is the guide for the Tibetan people, and the happy life of the Tibetan people still depends on the efforts of all the Tibetan people themselves. He has realized his bright future. He said: "I can't just work at my doorstep! I am actively studying now, preparing to obey the organization's assignment to go to Tibet to carry out work after Tibet is liberated."
　　The Tibetan working people, who have always been despised and trampled upon by the Kuomintang rulers, work hard all year round and cannot get enough to eat and wear; when they once change from slaves to masters, their wisdom is freely and fully developed.

　　Running Towards the Light
　　Like a lighthouse standing on the coast. The Tibetan people in the border areas of Sichuan, Gansu, Kang, and Qing are flocking to the light. Representatives of the tribes in the Tongren area of Qinghai have come; representatives of the tribes in the Songpan area of northern Sichuan have come; representatives of the Guoluo tribes have come; even before the PLA entered Sichuan, the leaders of the Tibetan tribes near Chengdu had already come. At a meeting to welcome representatives of some tribes in northern Sichuan, a representative of six tribes and twelve monasteries said: "Why did we run more than 2,000 li in the ice and snow to join the Communist Party? Because after Labrang was liberated, we saw that the Communist Party respected freedom of belief, and the People's Liberation Army protected the Labrang Grand Monastery well; they drove away Ma Bufang, and the suffering of the Tibetan people was relieved; the Communist Party sincerely helped the Tibetan people, and selected cadres from the Tibetan people to lead the work in the Tibetan area, giving the Tibetan people the right to autonomy. We have realized that following the Communist Party and uniting and cooperating with the Han and other ethnic groups under the leadership of the Central People's Government is the only way for our Tibetan people to obtain freedom and happiness."

　　解放后的拉卜楞
    ——西北旅行通讯之三
    （本报记者力文）
    去年九月间，解放军进军大西北。兰州解放了。马匪军被赶得抱头鼠窜。解放军的胜利声威大大地鼓舞了数十年来在蒋马匪帮铁蹄下饮泣吞声的拉卜楞藏区人民。他们在解放军刚进至临夏（距拉卜楞二百华里）时，便派出了自己的三位代表，去临夏与解放军接洽。解放军进入土门关（汉回与藏民分界地）后，一再被欢迎的人群所拦阻，藏民们争向解放军献“卡达”（藏礼，即一块绸纱）、狐皮、麝香等礼物。解放军接受了藏民的诚意，婉辞谢绝了他们的礼物。那几天，临夏至拉卜楞的静僻的山道上非常热闹，络绎不绝地流动着欢迎解放军的藏民同胞。藏区人民像迎接亲人似的，把解放军前拥后簇地接到藏区。
  心和咱一样
    在拉卜楞，我曾访问过藏民中的贫苦农牧民、知识青年和劳动妇女，也曾去寺院访问过喇嘛。解放后短短的两个多月时间，各阶层藏民的心目中，已产生了一种鲜明的爱与恨。
    在和阿篮等几位喇嘛谈心的时候，他们告诉我说：“马步芳整天跟藏民要马要牛，要草要料，稍不顺从，就要杀人。共产党、解放军赶走了马步芳，大人娃娃没有一个不说好的。”劳动人民更从共产党、人民政府工作人员的日常行动中，看出了社会的根本变化。曾给富家揽工多年的达奴告诉我：“国民党来到拉卜楞不是找保安司令，就是找县长，从来没把穷老百姓放在眼里；我们看见国民党官兵，很远就躲开了。共产党来了以后，老百姓舒展开了。我们和共产党的干部在一块有说有笑。干部们还问长问短，关心着我家的吃穿。”上他哇有个名叫沙奴娇的贫苦老太婆，因为与别人发生房租纠纷而去县政府起诉，起初她耽心着会因为“没有钱送礼”而进不了“衙门”。可是，出乎沙奴娇的意外，她受到了张副县长（从老解放区派来的）亲切的接待，纠纷很合理地解决了。她到处向人夸奖：“新政府真好。要是在过去，我没有钱怎能见到县长！”接着，她说：“共产党派来的干部，和咱藏民一条心啊！”
  藏族人民新纪元的开始
    拉卜楞各旧有机关的接管工作进行完毕后，在十、十一两个月中，曾先后在共和乡、示范镇等六个乡镇进行了民主选举。各乡、村普遍召开了村民大会、乡代表大会，选举了村政府委员、乡代表、乡政府委员以及出席全县各界代表会的代表。人民政府向群众讲清了政策，让人民自由地讨论，选择自己的代表。选举，给广大藏民以鼓舞，许多藏民带着“糌粑”茶叶、骑上马，越山过河，从数十里外赶来参加乡选。他们兴奋地说：“过去咱老百姓没有说话的地方，这个会真是‘沙格，沙格’（很好的意思）。”从下面的数字里，可以看出藏民参加选举的盛况：共和乡共二八八三人，选民共二一四○人（男八九○名，女一二五○）；实际参加选举的人数，男六五七人，女八五九人，共一五一六人，占选民总数的百分之七○·八。
    经过民主选举，劳动人民的地位空前地提高了，例如共和乡三十七个乡代表中，有三十人是劳动人民中的优秀分子。撒哈尔村过去是一个地位低微的弱小部落，这次选举中，该村雇工出身的达高，不仅当选为乡政府委员，并被选为出席全县各界代表会议的代表。全村藏民均兴高采烈，认为共产党给他们带来了幸福。该村另一个新当选的行政村主任王撒旦，也是一位贫苦藏民。
  藏民青年的觉悟迅速提高着
    藏民青年们对于新事物的接受显得更锐敏些。拉卜楞刚解放不到一个月，即有八十多名知识青年和民兵要求参加新民主主义青年团。民兵司令部的藏民青年，多是农牧民子弟，以前根本没有开会的习惯，更谈不到相互提意见了；现在，他们开始了民主生活，学习运用批评与自我批评的武器了。
    拉卜楞开办了十多年的藏民小学，每期毕业的藏民学生，有时仅一、二人，最多的一次也未超过七人；但在解放后的两个月中，拉卜楞藏民青年已有六十余人（内有妇女十余名）远赴兰州市学习，这显明地表现出藏民青年的觉悟在迅速地提高着。原籍青海的依旦加，十几岁时为逃避马匪抓兵而跑到拉卜楞当了六年伙夫，现在他自动参加了革命的行列，到兰州学习去了。他兴奋地告诉他的朋友：“我认识了共产党是真正为藏民谋利益的。我一定好好工作，藏民出头的日子到了。”
  我看到了藏族人民的智慧
    谈起散居边疆的藏民，曾有人以为藏区交通闭塞，生产不发达，文化落后，藏民生活简陋，因而想像着藏民是“愚昧无知”的。经过二十天来深入藏民群众的访问，我深切感到这种看法是十分错误的。诚然，藏区经济文化均甚落后，除寺院喇嘛外，不论男女，绝大多数的藏民与文化是无缘的。可是，解放后的拉卜楞，在许多场合里，我见到了藏族劳动人民的智慧。夏河各民族民主促进会有个刚刚脱掉破烂老羊皮袄、穿上灰色制服的小勤务员希来，是一个贫苦藏民的孩子，他伏在桌子上用心地学习藏文字母。他在短短的两三天中，三十个字母已全部会写会读了。他并能领会某些普通的汉语招呼，和学会招待客人的简单礼节。我曾到过一位新参加工作的藏民撒奴（一个三十多的贫苦藏民）的家里，我进去的时候，他和他的妻子柔母吉，以及柔母吉的表妹金藻，正在练习藏文。新订的毛头纸小本上，歪歪斜斜地画着一片片的字母。撒奴笑着说：“解放前，我们都是一字不识的老粗。柔母吉学得最快，只三五天，字母全部学会，已开始学拼音了。”更令人惊奇的，撒奴与工作人员接近才半个多月，已懂得了许多革命道理。他对藏区全部解放充满着信心与热情。详细谈话后，我才了解到撒奴夫妇热心学习的原因，撒奴的打算是：共产党是藏民的引路人，藏民的康乐生活还要靠全体藏民自己的努力。他已意识到自己光辉的前途，他说：“我不能光在家门上工作啊！我现下积极学习，准备在西藏解放后，服从组织分配去西藏开展工作。”
    一贯遭受国民党统治者轻蔑、蹂躏的藏族劳动人民，终年辛勤劳动，不得温饱；当他们一旦由奴隶变为主人的时候，他们的智慧就自由地充分发扬了。
  向光明奔来了
    像一座耸立在海岸上的灯塔。川、甘、康、青边区的藏族人民纷纷向光明奔来了。青海同仁一带部落的代表来了；川北松潘一带的部落代表来了；果洛部落的代表来了；在解放军尚未进入四川以前，成都附近藏民部落的领袖早就来了。在一次欢迎川北某些部落代表的会议上，一位代表六个部落十二个寺院的代表说：“我们为什么在冰天雪地，跑二千多里地，来投向共产党呢？因为拉卜楞解放后，我们见到了共产党尊重信仰自由，人民解放军在拉卜楞大寺保护得好好的；他们赶走了马步芳，藏民的痛苦解除了；共产党真心帮助藏民，由藏民中选派干部领导藏区工作，给藏民以自治的权利。我们已经认清跟着共产党走，在中央人民政府领导下同汉族以及其他民族团结合作，是我们藏民得到自由幸福唯一的道路。”
