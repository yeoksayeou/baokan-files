Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, February 12th: TASS, Tokyo, February 11th: On February 8th, Akahata published an article entitled "Underground Slaughter Factory - Tokyo Was the Center of Germ Warfare," exposing the Japanese army's preparation for and use of bacteriological weapons. The original text is as follows:

“The Soviet Military Tribunal, which sentenced General Yamada and eleven other Japanese war criminals guilty of preparing and using bacteriological weapons on December 30th last year, revealed that the Japanese army had been intensively preparing for bacteriological warfare in Manchuria. The center of Japan's preparation for bacteriological warfare was originally in Tokyo, located in the former Army Medical School in Wakamatsu-cho, and its core was the Anti-Epidemic Laboratory in the school's secret buildings. Bacterial experts were first trained in this laboratory and then sent to Manchuria. This laboratory had a huge underground experimental factory engaged in breeding bacteria and manufacturing bacteriological weapons.

All of this was revealed by a former employee of the Anti-Epidemic Laboratory, a former Captain Medical Officer. This person now uses the pseudonym Nakagawa Giichi. He also talked about the following circumstances of Japan's preparation for bacteriological warfare:

　　Ishii in charge of Tokyo bacteria factory - Large-scale testing of bacteriological warfare weapons

At that time, within the area of the Army Medical School, there was a restricted area that only special personnel were allowed to enter. This restricted area was the Anti-Epidemic Laboratory, where thousands of generals and other medical officers, as well as military physicians, were conducting investigations and research under the guidance of former Lieutenant General Medical Officer Shiro Ishii. The laboratory was engaged in cultivating cholera, typhoid bacteria (for use in water), glanders and other bacteria (for use in horses and other livestock), gas gangrene bacteria (for use in humans); researching methods of using these bacteria and defending against them; researching ways and methods of dispersing these bacteria from the air; researching how to explode landmines, grenades, bullets and glass bombs containing these bacteria on the water surface, and things like that. The director of the laboratory, former Lieutenant General Shiro Ishii, told the staff of the laboratory: "Military medicine is not just about treatment and prevention, the real military medicine aims at offense." To encourage the staff of the laboratory, films were made and screened depicting Soviet officers being brutally killed, depicting glanders bacteria being injected into horses' bodies leading to their death, and examining the entire process of horse corpses.

　　For the purpose of experimentation, animal blood was injected into the human body, people were locked in houses infected with anthrax bacteria, and lymph glands were extracted from living people. The heads and parts of the bodies of soldiers of the Chinese People's Liberation Army who had been killed were preserved in Japan for research purposes. There were many such things, and the bodies of prisoners who had been starved to death were preserved intact. In a special room, there were materials registration forms for the deaths of more than 200 soldiers and civilians who died as a result of being used as experiments. Only the staff of this laboratory were allowed to enter this room, and before entering, they had to sign an oath promising not to tell others what they had seen.

　　In the basement of the Army Medical School, there was a huge secret factory, using conveyor belt equipment, engaged in manufacturing bacteriological weapons and breeding bacteria. Lieutenant General Ishii himself said: This factory is a model for creating bacteriological weapons ordnance factories.

As an interlude in Japan's bacteriological warfare, before the end of the war, there were plans to release balloons with bombs containing anthrax and gangrene bacteria to attack the United States. During the war, this Anti-Epidemic Laboratory and underground factory suffered considerable damage during a heavy bombing in Tokyo, and a part of it was later moved to Akita and Niigata, and was completely destroyed at the end of the war."

### 日共赤旗报专文揭露  东京曾是细菌战中心  若松町设有巨大地下杀人工厂

　　日共赤旗报专文揭露
    东京曾是细菌战中心
    若松町设有巨大地下杀人工厂
    【新华社北京十二日电】塔斯社东京十一日讯：二月八日赤旗报发表题为“地下杀人工厂——东京是细菌战的中心”的一篇文章，暴露日军准备细菌战和使用细菌武器的情形。原文如下：
    “去年十二月三十日将犯有准备和使用细菌武器罪的山田将军及十一名其他日本战犯判刑的苏联军事法庭，揭露了日军曾在满洲紧张地准备细菌战争的情形。日本准备细菌战的中心，原来在东京，设在若松町的前军医学校中，其中心是在该校秘密建筑物中的防疫实验所。细菌专家先在这实验所中受训，然后派往满洲。这实验所设有巨大的地下实验工厂，从事繁殖细菌并制造细菌武器。
    所有这一切，都是该防疫实验所以前的一名雇员，前上尉军医官所透露的。此人现用假名中川义一。他还谈到日本准备细菌战的以下一些情形：
    石井负责东京细菌工厂  大规模试验细菌战武器
    当时在该军医学校区域内，原有一处禁区，仅特殊人员才许入内。这禁区就是防疫实验所，有数千名将级和其他军医官以及随军医师，在前中将医官石井四郎的指导下。在该所进行调查和研究的工作。这实验所从事培养霍乱、伤寒细菌（施用于水）、鼻疽病及其他病菌（施用于马及其他牲畜）、瓦斯壤疽病细菌（施用于人）；研究使用这些细菌与防御这些细菌的方法，研究从空中散放这些细菌的方式、方法，研究如何爆炸装有这些细菌的地雷、榴弹、枪弹和在水面上爆炸的玻璃弹，以及诸如此类的事情。该所所长、前中将石井四郎告诉该所工作人员说：“军事医学不仅仅是治疗和预防的方法，真正的军事医学，其目的在于进攻”。为鼓励该所工作人员起见，曾摄制并放映电影，描述苏联军官如何被惨酷致死，描述将鼻疽病细菌注入马的肌体致马于死，和检验马尸的全部过程。
    为进行试验起见，曾将动物的血液注入人体中，曾将人关闭在传染有炭疽热病细菌的房屋中，并曾从活人身上抽取淋巴腺。将被弄死的中国人民解放军士兵的头颅和躯体的各部分，保存在日本，以供研究之用。这种事情是很多的，被饿死的囚犯的尸体，被完整地保存起来。在一个特别的房间中，存有因被用作实验而丧命的二百余名军人与平民的死亡情形的材料登记表。唯有这一实验所的工作人员，才允许进入这一房间，而且在进去之前，必须签名具结，誓不将见到的情形告诉他人。
    在该军医学校的地下室中，设有巨大的秘密工厂，使用运送带的装置，从事制造细菌武器和繁殖细菌。石井中将本人曾称：这一工厂是创造细菌武器军火工厂的模范。
    作为日本细菌战中的一段插曲，是在战争将要结束之前，曾计划施放气球，其上装置带有山炭疽热和壤疽病细菌的炸弹，以袭击美国。在战争期间，这防疫实验所和地下工厂在东京某次被猛烈轰炸时，曾受到相当大的破坏，以后有一部分被迁往秋田和新泻，在战争结束时被全部破坏。”
