	[Reported by this newspaper] Most of the autumn public grain from North China in 1949 has been stored. To do a good job in grain storage, the relevant grain management departments in various provinces have successively formulated various systems and regulations, and improved grain management organizations. In Chahar Province, the autumn grain collection task has been fully completed, exceeding the original target by more than 10 million catties of millet. Hebei Province is striving to complete the autumn grain collection. Most of the public grain in these two provinces has been stored. As of January 8th, 81.99% of the public grain in Pingyuan Province had been stored. Shanxi Province, which started the autumn grain collection later under the leadership, has also received 74% of the total amount. In the Suidong area of Suiyuan Province, 96.85% of the grain has been stored.

	The peasants in North China, tempered by long-term struggles, have a higher level of awareness and warmly support the collection of public grain. The cadres worked very hard during the autumn grain collection. The preparatory work for storage was also very thorough, and the storage of public grain in various places was very smooth. Only in individual areas, the grain depot cadres did not do a good job in organizational work beforehand, resulting in farmers being very crowded when delivering grain, wasting manpower and animal power, causing some losses. This is worthy of attention in the future.

	The grain collected and stored this year has the following three situations. First, most areas of North China suffered from drought followed by floods last year, and the harvest was not good. The quality of the grain was generally not high, and the quality of the stored public grain was not as good as last year. Chahar Province had better grain quality due to lighter disasters; in the grain collection process, awards were given to model autumn grain collectors, forming a movement to deliver good grain, so the quality of the public grain was even better than the grain on the market. Second, some areas did not properly grasp the grain conversion rate. Some backward masses saw that certain grain was cheaper and delivered that. As a result, more rice and miscellaneous grains were collected, which caused difficulties in storage. Taking Hebei Province as an example, the government stipulated that 137.5 catties of millet should be converted into 100 catties of rice, while the past habit was 133 to 135 catties of millet to 100 catties of rice. This year's regulation was too high, resulting in more rice being collected than millet. Furthermore, in Pingyuan Province, according to the government's regulations, 1.6 catties of corn were converted into 1 catty of millet, but the market price in Anyang Prefecture at that time was 1 catty of millet converted into 1.12 catties of corn, resulting in more miscellaneous grains being collected than millet. The main reason for this phenomenon was that the market situation was not effectively grasped when determining the conversion rate. This experience is worth remembering. In the future, when collecting public grain, the grain conversion rate must be realistic and adapted to local conditions, in order to better implement the principle of taking into account both "national needs" and "people's possessions". Third, the simple task-oriented view and localism of some grain collection cadres are also a reason for the decline in the quality of public grain. Some cadres often do not pay much attention to the quality of grain in order to complete the task more easily. Some places value the quality of local grain but not the quality of public grain. This kind of irresponsible and narrow localist ideological style is very harmful and must be strictly corrected.

	This year's public grain has been decided to be centrally stored. This is convenient for transfer and transportation, which is of great help in ensuring supply and stabilizing prices. However, because the quality of this year's public grain is poor, and there is more rice and miscellaneous grain; last year's rainfall in North China was high and the ground was wet; in addition, the warehouses in various places are mostly old and damp ancestral halls and temples, which has increased the difficulty of public grain storage. Therefore, the first priority is to do a good job in anti-spoilage work in grain storage. The grain management agencies in various provinces have formulated various effective methods in response to this situation. The Hebei Provincial Grain Bureau has formulated several measures to strengthen storage work: First, establish a personal responsibility system for storage work, determine the person in charge of grain depots at all levels, and strengthen storage responsibility. Overcome the past phenomenon of everyone being responsible, which resulted in no one being responsible. Second, establish a strict inspection and reporting system to overcome bureaucracy and superficial work in grain management. It is stipulated that regular inspection reports should be made. Large depots with more concentrated grain storage should be inspected every five days; directors of county and district depots should conduct a general inspection with the storage department at the end of each month and report the inspection results to the higher level. Grain spoilage mostly occurs during the rainy season and when the sun rises in early spring, so seasonal inspection reports should also be made. Third, strengthen contact with the government at the same level and regularly report grain conditions to the commissioner and county head to avoid creating an isolated phenomenon in grain management. At present, the number of grain depot cadres in various places is insufficient and their abilities are relatively weak. Accepting the leadership and assistance of the county and prefectural governments will be of great help to grain storage work. In addition, in the old liberated areas with higher mass awareness, especially in the newly liberated areas, it is necessary to closely rely on the masses, and through the public security departments, prevent theft and maintain grain safety.

	The warehouse conditions in Pingyuan Province are mostly poor, especially in the areas along the Yellow River and Wei River. It is planned to build some warehouses with emphasis, and it is decided to strengthen the organizational structure of grain storage and establish an inspection and reporting system. The Provincial Grain Bureau organizes forces every month to conduct spot checks in various places based on the reports of district depots. District depots inspect branch depots once every half month, and again after each rain; branch depots inspect once every ten days, and again after each rain. Detailed regulations have also been made on the reporting system. Grain depots at all levels should organize inspection teams to specialize in inspection work. Shanxi Province's grain management work currently has two systems: personal responsibility and collective responsibility. In the future, it is planned to universally implement the personal responsibility system. Chahar Province has promulgated a code of conduct for warehouse personnel.

	It is a good phenomenon that various provinces have formulated so many regulations and rules related to grain storage. In the future, attention should be paid to creating good storage experiences, supplementing and revising these rules at any time, and persisting in implementing them in order to achieve the expected results.

### 华北公粮大部入库  各省健全管理机构  加强粮食保管工作

　　华北公粮大部入库
    各省健全管理机构  加强粮食保管工作
    决定公粮集中保管  首先做好防腐工作
    山西粮食保管工作  将推行专人负责制
    【本报讯】华北区一九四九年秋季公粮已大部入库。为作好粮食保管工作，各省有关粮食管理部门已先后制订了各种制度与规章，并健全了粮食管理机构。察哈尔省的秋征任务已全部完成，并超过原订任务一千余万斤小米。河北省正在争取结束秋征。两省公粮已大部入库。平原省到一月八日止，入库公粮已达总数的百分之八十一点九九。山西省领导上对秋征布置较晚，也已经收到总数的百分之七十四。绥远省绥东地区入库粮食已达百分之九十六点八五。
    华北区的农民经过长期斗争的锻炼，觉悟程度较高，对公粮征收热烈拥护。干部在秋征中非常努力。入库工作事前准备又很充分，各地公粮入库均十分顺利。仅个别地区的粮库干部事前未作好组织工作，致农民交粮时非常拥挤，浪费人力、畜力，造成了一些损失。这是值得今后注意的。
    今年收缴入库的粮食有下面三种情况。第一、去年华北大部地区先旱后涝，年景不好，粮食质量一般不高，入库公粮的质量也就不如去年。察哈尔省因灾情较轻，粮质较好；各地在征粮中又采用评奖秋征模范，形成了交好粮运动，故公粮质量比市场上的粮食还好。第二若干地区掌握粮种折合率不当。有些落后群众看见那种粮食便宜，就交那种。结果收缴的米和杂粮多，给保管工作造成了困难。以河北省来说，公家规定一三七斤半谷子折合一百斤米，而过去的习惯是一三三斤到一三五斤谷子折一百斤米。今年的规定过高，结果征来的米比谷子多。再以平原省来说，按公家规定一斤六两玉米折合一斤小米，但安阳专区当时市价是一斤小米折合一斤十二两玉米，结果收缴的杂粮比小米多。造成这一现象的原因，主要是在确定折合率的时候，没有切实掌握市场情况。这一经验值得我们记取。今后征收公粮时，在规定粮种折合率必须切合实际，因地制宜，才能很好贯彻“国需”与“民有”兼顾的原则。第三有些征粮干部的单纯任务观点与地方主义思想，也是使公粮质量降低的一个原因。有些干部为了比较容易地完成任务，往往不大重视粮食的质量。有的地方则重视地方粮的质量，而不大重视公粮的质量。这种对工作不认真和狭隘的地方主义的思想作风是十分有害的，必须严加纠正。
    今年的公粮已决定了集中保管的原则。这样作便于调运，对于保证供给，平稳物价，均有很大帮助。但因今年公粮质量较差，米和杂粮又多；去年华北地区雨量大，地面湿；加以各地的仓库多系利用古老、潮湿的祠堂、庙宇，这就加重了公粮保管的困难。因此首先要做好粮食保管上的防腐工作，各省粮食管理机关针对这一情况，均先后制订了各种有效办法。河北省粮食局已制订了加强保管工作的几项措施：第一、建立保管工作的专人负责制，确定各级粮库的负责人，加强保管责任。克服过去大家负责，结果是大家都不负责的散漫现象。第二、建立严格的检查报告制度，克服粮食管理工作中的官僚主义和走马看花的作风。规定要作定期的检查报告。凡存粮较集中的大库每五天检查一次；县库、区库主任在每月终应带领保管股进行普遍检查，向上汇报检查结果。粮食霉烂多在雨季及春初阳气上升之时，因此还应作季节性的检查报告。第三、加强与同级政府的联系，定期向专员县长报告粮食情况，以避免造成粮食管理中的孤立现象。现在各地粮库干部数量不够，能力也比较弱，接受县与专区政府的领导帮助，对于粮食保管工作将有很大帮助。此外在群众觉悟较高的老解放区，特别是在解放不久的新区，要紧密依靠群众，通过公安部门，防止偷盗，维护粮食安全。
    平原省仓房条件大多不好，尤以沿黄河及卫河地区为甚。准备有重点地建立一些仓库，并决定充实粮食保管的组织机构，建立检查报告制度。省粮食局每月组织力量根据区库报告，到各地进行抽查。区库每半月检查分库一次，每逢雨后再检查一次；分库每十天检查一次，雨后再检查一次。关于报告制度也作了详细规定。各级粮库均应组织检查组，专司检查工作。山西省的粮食管理工作现有专人负责制与集体负责制两种，今后将准备普遍推行专人负责制。察哈尔省曾颁布了仓库人员守则。
    各省制定了这许多有关粮食保管的制度及规则，这是很好的现象。今后应注意创造一些好的保管经验，随时补充修正这些规则，并坚持贯彻下去，才能收到预期效果。
