　　Introduction to Candidates for the Supreme Soviet of the USSR
　　Honored and Respected by the People for Their Heroic Labor
　　The candidates for the Supreme Soviet of the USSR include many of the most advanced Soviet workers, who have earned this high honor through their selfless labor, personal ability, honest service to the people, and social activities. These workers are an extraordinary group of heroes belonging to the courageous innovators of production methods, and they are all vanguard fighters striving to complete the Stalin Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule.
　　Bikov, a lathe operator at the Moscow Grinding Machine Factory, is one such hero. He demonstrated in practice that the speed of cutting metal on a lathe can be increased to 800 to 1,000 meters per minute, an achievement that earned him the Stalin Prize. Bikov not only used the method of accelerated metal production but also taught other workers. Now, thousands of Stakhanovite lathe operators use his method. In the four years of the post-war Five-Year Plan, Bikov produced products that would have taken twenty-three years to produce according to the plan.
　　The name of Rosiisky, a senior foreman at the Kaliber Factory, is also familiar to the Soviet people. He is the son of a rural collective farm in the Moscow region. When he was young, he came to this factory. He graduated from a technical school and learned the technology. Mastering his profession, he became a Stakhanovite worker. In his department, all work groups participated in the Stakhanovite movement, and all workers exceeded their quotas. Rosiisky's experience has spread far and wide. The workers, engineers, and staff of the Kaliber Factory have nominated Rosiisky as their candidate for the Supreme Soviet of the USSR.
　　Lumberjack Gotchev is also an outstanding innovator. At his initiative, transportation methods were used in timber production for the first time ever. Lumberjacks in many regions of the Soviet Union have adopted his creation. He was one of the first in the country to achieve unprecedented success in using electric saws. The lumberjacks of the Karelian-Finnish Republic nominated Gotchev as a candidate.
　　Among the workers nominated as candidates for the Supreme Soviet of the USSR are Zhutkike, the initiator of the nationwide competition for high-quality products; Amosov, a steelworker at the Zlatoust Steel Plant; Shtirova, a textile worker at the Moscow "Three Mountains" Factory who manages sixteen looms simultaneously; Simigin, a sixty-year-old honorary miner from Kemerovo Oblast; and Blakhnov, a senior engine driver on the Moscow-Lisen Railway.
　　In several electoral districts, the working people of the Soviet Union have nominated famous Soviet metallurgists—smelters, blast furnace operators, foremen, and engineers—as candidates for representatives to the Supreme Soviet of the USSR. These people are honored and respected by the people for their heroic labor.
　　In the Zlatoust electoral district, Vasily Amosov, a steelworker from the Urals, has been nominated as a candidate. Amosov, an outstanding Stakhanovite worker and pioneer, has smelted thousands of tons of steel above the plan during the post-war Five-Year Plan. He is the initiator of a nationwide competition among metallurgical workers. Amosov is not only known as an advanced steelworker but also as a public figure. He attended the World Congress of Supporters of Peace as a representative of the Soviet Union.
　　In the Moscow Oblast Electric Steel electoral district, Alexei Zhuravlev, a Stakhanovite steelworker at the "Electric Steel" factory, has been nominated as a candidate for the Supreme Soviet of the USSR. He was elected as a representative to the Supreme Soviet of the USSR in the 1946 election and fulfilled the instructions of his voters. Twenty years ago, Zhuravlev left his village and started working in the factory as an unskilled worker. Now, he has fully mastered the complex production process of special steel and greatly accelerated the smelting rate. In 1949 alone, he produced 400 tons of steel above the plan. A large number of metallurgical workers have applied his production experience to their work. He also wrote a booklet called "Stakhanovite Methods of Managing Electric Smelting Furnaces." At his initiative, a Stakhanovite labor training class was established in the factory.
　　Ivan Korubaev, a supervisor at the Makiivka Steel Factory, has been nominated again as a candidate for the Supreme Soviet of the USSR. Korubaev has been working by the blast furnace for half a century. All of the Soviet Union knows that the people in Korubaev's family are "hereditary metallurgists." Comrade Stalin said the following at the reception for Stakhanovite movement participants held in the Kremlin on October 29, 1937: Let us raise a glass to the health of the new and old fighters in the field of blast furnaces in metallurgy! First, to the health of Comrade Korubaev, the blast furnace operator, to the health of old Korubaev and Korubaev's son, and to the health of the entire Korubaev family—the blast furnace workers. Let us wish the Korubaev family good health and may their work improve every day.

　　苏最高苏维埃代表候选人介绍
    由于他们的英勇劳动，得到人民的尊崇与敬佩
    苏联最高苏维埃代表的候选人，包括许多最先进的苏维埃工人，由于他们的忘我的劳动、个人的能力、老老实实为人民服务和社会活动，他们赢得了这种高度的荣誉。这些工人是属于生产方法勇敢的革新者的非凡的一群英雄人物，他们都是争取提前完成斯大林五年计划的先锋战士。
    莫斯科磨床制造厂的旋工比科夫，就是这一类的英雄人物。他实地证明了用车床切金属，其速度可以提高到每分钟八百到一千公尺，这一成就使他获得斯大林奖金。比科夫不仅是使用了加速金属制作的方法，而且还教会其他的工人。现在，有数以千计的斯塔哈诺夫旋工使用他的方法。在战后五年计划的四年内，比科夫生产了按照计划要二十三年才能生产出来的生产品。
    卡利伯工厂的高级领班罗西斯基的名字，也是苏联人民所熟悉的。他是莫斯科州的农村集体农场的儿子。当他还是青年的时候，便到这家工厂来。他卒业于技术学校，并且学会了技术。精通了他的业务，他便成了一个斯塔哈诺夫式工作者。在他那部门，所有的工作组都参加了斯塔哈诺夫运动，并且所有的工人都超过他们的定额。罗西斯基的经验传播到很远的地方。卡利伯工厂的工人、工程师和职员，已推选罗西斯基为他们的苏联最高苏维埃的候选人。
    伐木工人哥特契也夫，也是一位出色的革新者，在他的倡议之下，运送方法破天荒第一次地在木材生产中被采用。苏联许多地区的木材工人，都采用了他的创造。他是全国使用电锯工作获得空前未有成就的第一批人之一。卡累利阿芬兰共和国的木材工人推举哥特契也夫为候选人。
    工人们提名苏联最高苏维埃的候选人中有争取上等产品的全国性竞赛的发起人朱特基克，兹拉托斯特钢铁厂的炼钢工人阿摩索夫，莫斯科“三山”工厂同时管理十六架织机的纺织工人什蒂罗娃，基米罗伏州的六十岁高龄的荣誉矿工西米金，莫斯科利森铁路的高级引擎驾驶员布拉赫诺夫等。
    苏联劳动人民在若干选区中已经举荐苏联著名的冶金家们——熔炼工人、鼓风炉司炉、领班和工程师——为苏联最高苏维埃代表的候选人。这些人，由于他们的英勇劳动而得到人民的尊崇和敬佩。
    在兹拉桃斯特选区，乌拉尔的炼钢工人华西里·阿莫索夫已被提名为候选人。阿莫索夫这位成绩卓著的斯塔哈诺夫式的工作者和开路先锋，在战后五年计划期间，已超计划熔炼了数以千吨计的钢。他是在冶金工人中发起全国范围竞赛的倡议人。阿莫索夫不只以先进的炼钢工人闻名，并且还是社会名人。他曾以苏联代表的资格出席世界拥护和平大会。
    在莫斯科州电钢选区，“电钢”工厂的斯塔哈诺夫式炼钢工人阿列克赛·儒拉夫列夫，已被提名为苏联最高苏维埃代表候选人。在一九四六年选举时，他曾被选为苏联最高苏维埃代表，并且完成了选民对他的嘱托。二十年以前，儒拉夫列夫离开他的本村，开始在工厂中工作，充当非技术工人。现在，他已完全精通了特等钢的复杂的生产过程，并且大大加速了熔炼率。仅在一九四九年，他就超计划生产了四百吨钢。广大的冶金工人已经把他的生产经验运用到他们的工作中。他还著了一本小册子，名叫《管理电力熔炼炉的斯塔哈诺夫式方法》。在他的倡议下，工厂里成立了斯塔哈诺夫式劳动训练班。
    马基也夫卡钢铁工厂监工伊凡·柯鲁包夫再次被提名为苏联最高苏维埃代表候选人。柯鲁包夫已在鼓风炉旁工作了半个世纪。全苏联都知道柯鲁包夫家里的人是“祖传的冶金家”。斯大林同志在一九三七年十月二十九日在克里姆林宫举行的斯塔哈诺夫运动者招待会上讲演时曾说过这样的话：让我们举杯祝冶金方面鼓风炉事业的新老斗士们的健康！首先祝鼓风炉司炉柯鲁包夫同志的健康、祝老柯鲁包夫和柯鲁包夫的儿子以及柯鲁包夫全家——鼓风炉工人——的健康。让我们祝柯鲁包夫这一家的健康，愿他们的工作精益求精。
