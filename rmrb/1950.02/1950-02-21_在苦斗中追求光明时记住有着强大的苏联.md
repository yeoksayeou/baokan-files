  　Remember the Powerful Soviet Union While Pursuing Light in Hard Struggle
    When you are pursuing light in hard struggle, remember the existence of a powerful Soviet Union, which is the hope and backing of all oppressed nations, because with the October Revolution and the weapon of Marxism-Leninism, the colonized and enslaved people have found the road to victory.
    When you encounter difficulties in your advancement, do not forget that the Chinese people have also gone through a difficult and tortuous road to achieve today's glorious victory.
    When you are heroically fighting against imperialism, with you are the peace and democratic forces of the whole world, where there are the working classes of imperialist countries and the democratic youth who oppose the colonial system.
    Hundreds of millions of people in Asia are creating a new history, holding their destiny firmly in their own hands. In this earth-shaking wave, Chinese youth care about your every struggle, share your pain, and extend a hand of friendship to you. You can believe that Chinese youth cheer for your soon-to-be-won victory as they cheer for their own victory.
    Down with imperialism!
    Long live the solidarity of the youth of the world!
　        Central Committee of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League

  　在苦斗中追求光明时记住有着强大的苏联
    当你们在苦斗中追求光明时，记住有一个强大的苏联的存在，它是一切被压迫民族的希望与靠山，因为有了十月革命，有了马列主义的武器，殖民地被奴役的人民才找到了走向胜利的道路。
    当你们在前进中遇到困难时，不要忘记中国人民也曾走过一段艰苦曲折的道路，才有今天辉煌的胜利。
    当你们英勇地和帝国主义作斗争时，和你们在一起的是整个世界的和平民主力量，那里有帝国主义国家的工人阶级，也有反对殖民制度的民主青年。
    亚洲千百万人民正在创造新的历史，要把命运紧握在自己的手里。在这个翻天覆地的巨浪中，中国青年关心你们的每一个斗争，分担你们的痛苦，并向你们伸出友谊的手。你们可以相信，中国青年像欢呼自己的胜利一样，欢呼你们不久将要获得的胜利。
    打倒帝国主义！
    全世界青年团结万岁！
