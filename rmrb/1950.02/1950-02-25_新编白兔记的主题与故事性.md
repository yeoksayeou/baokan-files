　　The "Raiding the Grass Valleys" (Newly Compiled White Rabbit Tale) being performed at the Popular Theater is adapted from the "White Rabbit Tale" compiled by Zhui Baiqiu, written by Comrade Yang Shaoxuan, directed by Comrade Li Zigui, and performed by the Academy of Chinese Opera. The historical background of this play is the 10th century AD, the middle of the Later Five Dynasties, when the Khitan ruler Yelü Deguang invaded the Chinese mainland, carrying out barbaric plunder and causing great suffering to the people. Later, the people organized to resist, attacking the enemy everywhere, and drove the enemy away in three months. The distinct feature of this play from the old White Rabbit Tale is that it combines the folk tales with the political situation of the time, so that the art of opera can reflect the reality of history. This historical period also illustrates that national wars are essentially the product of peasant and land issues.
    This play is interwoven from the following main stories. One is from Li Sanniang giving birth in the mill, to Old Man Dou delivering the infant a thousand miles. This story uses Li Hongyi and his wife as bad examples, and Old Man Dou as a good example, to oppose bullying the poor and loving the rich, to oppose snobbery, to praise helping those in need, drawing swords for justice, and to praise helping those in distress and acting bravely for a just cause. This reflects the excellent side of our traditional morality, a side that belongs to the people's thinking. One is about the Khitan invasion of the Central Plains, Shi Jingtang ceding the Sixteen Prefectures of Yanyun, and calling himself the Son Emperor; and the likes of Sang Weihan and Du Chongwei, trembling with fear, willingly becoming slaves of slaves. These, however, reflect the shameful slave mentality of the feudal ruling class. The modern Zeng Guofan, Yuan Shikai, Wang Jingwei, Chiang Kai-shek, and those guys who brazenly flaunt their power under Truman and Marshall, are all of the same lineage. Another is about Khitan's Yelü Deguang, who proclaimed himself emperor in Bianliang, implemented the "Raiding the Grass Valleys" policy, enslaved the people, and plundered property ("History of the Five Dynasties: The Khitan ruler Yelü Deguang has destroyed Jin and sends thousands of cavalrymen every day, dividing them into the four fields to rob the people, called 'Raiding the Grass Valleys'"). This aroused the people's heroic resistance, digging ditches, setting ambushes, and attacking the Khitans everywhere, making Yelü Deguang restless and finally withdrawing from eastern China. Here, Zhang Yi, Wang Qiong, Wu Xingde, Wu Xingyou and others resist Yelü Deguang's aggressive policy, combined with the vast anti-aggression forces of the people. Liu Zhiyuan was influenced by this, so he opposed the cession of the Sixteen Prefectures of Yanyun, and later opposed the enemy's "Raiding the Grass Valleys" policy. This script is obviously based on this point, and only this point can be written about the historical figure of Liu Zhiyuan.
    The writing of this play takes the people's anti-aggression struggle against "Raiding the Grass Valleys" as the ideological center of the play, interspersed with the story of Li Sanniang. This is a tragic play and also a comedy. The writing style of this play is no longer as dry and tasteless as some newly compiled scripts in the past, but has the beauty of a story. The greatest advantage of this play is that it combines ethical concepts with national consciousness, forming the conditions for a happy ending and becoming a meaningful comedy. Although the story develops along two lines, the director's appropriate editing and overall layout make the plot connectable. However, there are still some places that are not well connected or not natural, such as Li Sanniang discussing military affairs from the mill to the camp, which need to be revised.
    The people demand plays with plots. Many popular old plays are written with emotional appeal and strong story interest from the old point of view. Because of this, if the theme is not correct, it is easy to harm people, because many old plays contain the poison of oppressive thought and even traitorous thought, although they taste very sweet. For example, "Fourth Son Visits His Mother" has the beauty of a story, but it asks people to sympathize with elements who have no national integrity; "Ningwuguan" also has the beauty of a story, but it asks people to sympathize with class enemies who oppose the peasant revolution; "Nephew's Grave Visit" has the beauty of a story, but it asks people to sympathize with the private property of conservative landlords. Our new plays should surpass the old plays in plot and should promote the people's morality in content. The Chinese people have backbone in the face of oppressors. Wealth cannot corrupt them, power cannot subdue them, and poverty cannot move them. This is the traditional virtue of the Chinese people. Li Sanniang, Old Man Dou, the Wu brothers, Wang Qiong, Zhang Yi, and others generally oppose bullying the poor and loving the rich, and oppose the strong and domineering. Extended to national consciousness, they will inevitably oppose traitors and national aggression and oppression. Li Sanniang guarded for sixteen years. Her unyielding will is not only placed on the morality of husband and wife, but more importantly on her husband's just cause of resisting the Khitans at that time.

### 新编白兔记的主题与故事性

　　新编白兔记的主题与故事性
　　阿甲
    在大众剧场演出的《打草谷》（新编白兔记）是由缀白裘所辑的《白兔记》改成的，由杨绍萱同志编写，李紫贵同志导演，戏曲实验学校演出。这个戏的历史背景是纪元第十世纪时代，即后五代中叶，契丹国主耶律德光进攻中国本部，实行野蛮的略夺，人民受了极大的灾难。后来人民组织起来反抗，到处袭击敌人，三个月即把敌人打跑了。这个戏和旧有白免记不同的特点是：它把民间流传的故事，和当时的政治情况相结合，使戏曲艺术能反映历史的现实。这段历史也说明民族战争在本质上常是农民与土地问题的产物。
    这个戏是从以下几个主要故事穿插起来的。一个是从李三娘磨房产子，到窦老汉千里送婴。这段故事以李洪义夫妇做坏的典型，以窦老汉做好的典型，作为反对欺贫爱富，反对势利刻薄，赞成路见不平，拔剑相助，赞成扶危济困，见义勇为的榜样。这反映了我们传统道德中优秀的一面，这一面是属于人民的思想的。一个是写契丹入寇中原，石敬瑭割燕云十六州，称儿皇帝；还有桑维翰杜重威之流，诚惶诚恐，甘心当奴下之奴。这些，却又反映了封建统治阶级中可耻的奴才思想。近代的曾国藩、袁世凯、汪精卫、蒋介石，以及在杜鲁门马歇尔胯下张胆撒威的那些家伙们，都是这一脉相承的。再一个是写契丹耶律德光，称帝汴梁，实行打草谷政策，奴役人民，掳掠财物，（“五代史：契丹主耶律德光已灭晋，日遣数千骑，分出四野，劫掠人民，号为打草谷”。）激起人民的英勇反抗，到处挖沟渠、设埋伏、袭击契丹，使耶律德光寝食不安，终于退出中国东部。这里，写张乙、王琼、武行德、武行友等人，反抗耶律德光的侵略政策，与广大人民反侵略力量有着结合。刘智远受这种影响，所以反对割让燕云十六州，以及后来反对敌人的“打草谷”政策。这个剧本，显然是根据这一点来写的，关于刘智远这历史人物也只能写这一点。
    这个戏的写法，是以人民对付“打草谷”的反侵略斗争作为戏的思想中心，穿插以李三娘的故事。这是一个苦戏，又是一个喜剧。这出戏的编写作风，已不似过去一些新编剧本那样干燥无味，而是有故事美的。这个戏的最大的好处是把伦理观念与民族意识相结合，构成大团圆的条件，成为一个有意义的喜剧。虽然故事是两条线发展，但经过导演的适当剪接和全面布局，使情节可以贯串起来。不过也还有不太衔接不太自然的地方，如李三娘从磨房到营帐，便议论军国大事等，还有待修正。
    人民要求有情节的戏。许多流行的旧戏，在旧的观点上，写得入情入理，有浓厚的故事趣味。正因如此，倘使主题思想不正确便容易叫人受害，因为好些旧戏里面，多含有压迫思想，乃至汉奸思想的毒素，虽然吃起来很甜。比如《四郎探母》，便是有故事美的，可是它要人去同情没有民族气节的分子；《宁武关》也是有故事美的，可是它要人去同情反对农民革命的阶级敌人；《打侄上坟》是有故事美的，可是它要人去同情保守地主的私有财产。我们写的新戏在情节上应当胜过旧戏，在内容上应当宣传人民的道德。中国人民对于压迫者是有骨气的，富贵不淫，威武不屈，贫贱不移，就是中国人民传统的美德。李三娘、窦老丈、武氏兄弟、王琼、张乙等人，一般地是反对欺贫爱富、反对强凶霸道的，扩大到民族意识上，就必然反对汉奸卖国，反对民族侵略压迫。李三娘苦守十六年，他这百折不移的意志，不只是寄托在夫妻的道义上，更重要的是寄托在他那丈夫当时抗击契丹的正义事业上。
