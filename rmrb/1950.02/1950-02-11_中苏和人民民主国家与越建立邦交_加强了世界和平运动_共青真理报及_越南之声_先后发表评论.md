　　Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 9th: TASS, Moscow reports: Komsomolskaya Pravda commented on the Vietnam issue on the 8th, stating that the Soviet government's decision to establish diplomatic relations with the Democratic Republic of Vietnam has aroused boundless joy among the broad masses of the Vietnamese people. Progressive world opinion believes that the recognition of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam by the Soviet Union, China, and various People's Democratic countries is a significant contribution to the friendship and unity of the people of all countries fighting for peace, democracy, and socialism.

　　The commentary condemned the French imperialists' "dirty war" against the Vietnamese people, pointing out that the American ambitious schemers who attempt to dominate the world have shown unwavering interest in the gambling of the Vietnamese puppets. American newspapers openly believe that American intervention in Vietnam is an indispensable part of America's strategic plan in the Pacific. The imperialists are attempting to destroy the Vietnamese national liberation movement in this way: replacing the overly blatant form of colonial rule with an "independent" Bao Dai puppet regime, so that Vietnam remains under the trampling of French and American bankers. However, the Vietnamese people continue to struggle for the complete liberation of the country and have implemented various democratic reforms domestically. The fury of the imperialists eloquently proves that the struggle waged by the Vietnamese people and their valuable contribution to strengthening the forces of peace and democracy in Southeast Asia have dealt another blow to the heinous conspiracies of the Franco-American aggressors.

　　[Xinhua News Agency] Vietnam News Agency, North Vietnam, 5th: "Voice of Vietnam" stated today: It is natural that France and international reactionaries feel like "a thunderclap from a clear sky" at the Soviet Union's decision to recognize the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. The Soviet Union's recognition of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, like other People's Democratic countries, is based not only on the interests of the Vietnamese people, but also on the real interests of all other countries whose peoples are now fighting to defend world peace and democracy. The recognition of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam by the Soviet Union and other democratic countries in Europe and Asia is a timely action, which is to accelerate the final victory of Vietnam and give a strong impetus to the world democratic movement.

　　The Nefarious Conspiracies of International Reactionaries Cannot Stop the Raging Tide of the Red River

　　The cooperation of Chiang Kai-shek's remaining bandit troops and French troops in northern Vietnam, the comings and goings of American and British politicians in Vietnam, and the French imperialists' feigned "transfer of sovereignty" to the Bao Dai puppet government, etc., expose the despicable purposes of international reactionaries. After failing in their attempt to stop the democratic tide of the Yangtze River, France and its supporters fantasize that they can stop this tide in the Red River. But this is a painful illusion, because the democratic movement grows directly from the people of each country, not from exporting it from one country to another.

　　"Voice of Vietnam" pointed out: The rapid recognition of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam by the world's democratic countries is because Vietnam has become a completely autonomous country. "Voice of Vietnam" concluded: "Today Vietnam is facing huge but also glorious tasks and responsibilities, because it has become the outpost of the democratic movement in Southeast Asia."

　　中苏和人民民主国家与越建立邦交
    加强了世界和平运动
    共青真理报及“越南之声”先后发表评论
    【新华社北京九日电】塔斯社莫斯科讯：共青真理报八日评论越南问题称：苏联政府决定与越南民主共和国建立外交关系，在越南广大人民群众中间，引起了无限的欢欣鼓舞。世界进步舆论认为：苏联、中国以及各人民民主国家的承认越南民主共和国，对于为和平、民主与社会主义而斗争的各国人民的友谊与团结，是一个重大的贡献。
    评论斥责法帝国主义对越南人民“肮脏的战争”，指出企图统治世界的美国野心家，对越南傀儡的赌博表现出始终不变的兴趣。美国报纸公然认为美国对越南的干涉是美国在太平洋战略计划中不可缺少的组成部分。帝国主义者企图这样来摧毁越南的民族解放运动：以“独立的”保大傀儡政权来代替过于露骨的殖民地统治形式，而使越南仍处在法国和美国的银行家们的蹂躏之下。但越南人民继续在进行斗争，以争取国家的完全解放，并在国内实行了各项民主改革。帝国主义者的暴怒，雄辩地证明：越南人民所进行的斗争，和他们对加强东南亚和平民主力量所作的宝贵贡献，又给了法美侵略者的罪恶阴谋以一个打击。
    【新华社讯】越南通讯社北越五日电：“越南之声”今日称：法国和国际反动派对于苏联决定承认越南民主共和国有“平地一声雷”之感，这是很自然的。苏联之承认越南民主共和国，像其他人民民主国家一样，不仅是基于越南人民的利益，而且也基于现在为保卫世界和平与民主而战斗的一切其他各国人民的现实利益。苏联和欧亚两洲其他民主国家承认越南民主共和国，是一个适时的行动，这一行动是为了加速越南的最后胜利和予世界民主运动以强大的推动力。
    国际反动派的卑劣阴谋阻不住红河怒潮
    蒋介石的残余匪军和法国军队在越南北部的合作，美英政客的出入越南，法帝国主义者向保大傀儡政府假装“移交主权”等等，暴露了国际反动派的卑鄙目的。法国及其支持者在妄图阻挡长江的民主浪潮失败之后，幻想他们能在红河把这浪潮挡住。但这是一种痛苦的幻想，因为民主运动是直接从每个国家的人民中生长出来的，而不是从这一个国家向那一个国家输出的。
    “越南之声”指出：世界民主国家之迅速承认越南民主共和国，是因为越南已成为完全自主的国家。“越南之声”结语称：“今天越南正面对着巨大的但也是光荣的任务与责任，因为它已成了东南亚民主运动的前哨。”
