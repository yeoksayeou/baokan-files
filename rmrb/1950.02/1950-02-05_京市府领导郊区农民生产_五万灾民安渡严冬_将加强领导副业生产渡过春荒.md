　　Beijing News: The Beijing Municipal People's Government's leadership and assistance to suburban farmers in production and disaster relief work has achieved initial results, enabling 50,000 disaster victims in the entire suburbs (including 25,000 people who fled from other places) to safely overcome the severe winter. The Municipal Government's Suburban Work Committee is now continuing to strengthen this work, striving to overcome the spring famine through self-reliance in production. Beijing's suburbs suffered continuous disasters last year, including floods, droughts, insects, and hail. The flood alone affected 33 percent of the total farmland in the suburbs. The disaster victims in the severely affected areas totaled more than 25,000 people, most of whom lived on grass seeds last fall. In addition, about 25,000 disaster victims from Hejian, Renqiu, Baodi, Xianghe and other counties in Hebei Province successively fled to the suburbs of Beijing and gathered near the Mentougou mining area. In order to help disaster victims overcome the famine, the Beijing Municipal People's Government began to develop production and disaster relief work last fall. In addition to leading and assisting suburban farmers to overcome difficulties and plant more than 330,000 mu of wheat, so that the harvest period can be advanced to this summer to shorten the famine time, it also vigorously organized various sideline productions. Farmers in the 14th district, which was the most severely affected by the disaster, started to boil saltpeter in large quantities with the strong support of the cooperatives since last October. The district produced more than 35,000 jin of saltpeter every day, maintaining the lives of more than 9,000 people. In addition, disaster victims were mobilized to collect grass seeds, pick vegetable leaves, dig and sell loess, sell vegetables, make shoe soles, and carry stones. For example, the Nanxiaojie Village in the 14th district picked more than 3,000 jin of dried vegetable leaves last winter, which effectively subsidized the lives of the village's farmers. The 14th district also used the slack winter season to organize a total of 345 large and small carts to engage in transportation work, solving the livelihood problems of more than 4,000 people. For the disaster victims gathered in the Mentougou mining area, the "Mentougou Workers' Job Placement Center" was formed by the Beijing Xishan Mining Bureau, the Mentougou Coal Mine Trade Union, the 20th District Government, and the Mentougou Public Security Bureau to specifically solve the livelihood problems of the disaster victims. The center has found more than 460 rooms to resettle 35 families of refugees, totaling 123 people, and introduced 629 newly arrived refugees to employment. It was also decided that the current three-shift system (dividing one day and night into three shifts, with each shift working for eight hours) in each coal kiln will be gradually changed to a four-shift system to expand the scope of work and introduce disaster victims to work in the kiln to solve the livelihood problems of disaster victims. In addition, the 5,000 jin of rice saved monthly by all sectors of Mentougou District for disaster relief will be used to gradually send 5,000 disaster victims who cannot mine coal back to their places of origin. In order to help disaster victims overcome the upcoming spring famine season when the new crop is not yet available, the Municipal Government's Suburban Committee decided to strengthen the leadership of existing sideline production and prepare to use the work-for-relief method to build water conservancy projects to help the affected farmers.

　　京市府领导郊区农民生产
    五万灾民安渡严冬
    将加强领导副业生产渡过春荒
    【北京讯】京市人民政府领导与协助郊区农民生产救灾的工作，已获初步成绩，使全郊区五万灾民（包括外地逃来的二万五千人）均能安然渡过严冬。市府郊区工作委员会现正继续加强此项工作，争取以生产自救渡过春荒。京市郊区去年连续遭受水、旱、虫、雹等灾害。仅水灾一项所侵害的农地即占全郊区农地的百分之三十三。重灾地区的灾民，共约二万五千余人，去年秋天大多以吃草籽为生。此外，从河北省河间、任邱、宝坻、香河等县陆续逃来京郊聚集于门头沟矿区附近的灾民共约二万五千人。为协助灾民渡过灾荒，京市人民政府从去年秋天起就设法开展生产救灾工作，除领导与协助郊区农民排除困难，种麦三十三万余亩，使收获期提前到今年夏天以缩短灾荒时间外，并大力组织了各种副业生产。灾情最重的十四区农民，在合作社大力扶植下，从去年十月起开始大量熬硝，全区每日产硝三万五千余斤，维持了九千多人的生活。此外，还发动灾民从事扫草籽、拾菜叶、挖卖黄土、贩卖蔬菜、纳鞋底、包运石头等工作。如十四区南小街村去年冬天所拾菜叶，晒干后有三千多斤，有效地补助了该村农民的生活，十四区并利用冬天农闲时间组织了大车、小车共三百四十五辆，从事运输工作，解决了四千多人的生活问题。对于聚集在门头沟矿区的灾民，已由北京市人民政府京西矿务处、门头沟煤矿工会、二十区区政府、门头沟公安分局等机关组成“门头沟工人职业介绍所”专门负责解决灾民生活问题。该所已觅妥房屋四百六十余间，安置难民家属三十五家，计一百二十三人，介绍新来难民六百二十九人就业。并决定将各煤窑现时每日三班制（一昼夜分成三班作活，每班八小时），拟陆续改为四班制，扩大工作范围，介绍灾民下窑作工以解决灾民生活问题。此外将使用门头沟区各界每月节约救灾米的五千斤米，陆续资遣不能挖煤的五千灾民返回原籍。为协助灾民渡过即将到来的青黄不接的春荒季节，市府郊委会决定加强领导现有副业生产，并预备采用以工代赈方式兴修水利，以救助受灾农民。
