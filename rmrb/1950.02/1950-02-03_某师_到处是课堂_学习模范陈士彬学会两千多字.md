　　A Certain Division's "Classroom is Everywhere"
    Learning Model Chen Shibin Learns Over 2,000 Characters
    [Xinhua News Agency] A certain division of the North China People's Liberation Army has launched a cultural learning movement by adopting flexible and practical methods, achieving great results. Currently, all officers and soldiers in the division recognize more than 150 characters, and 50% of them can write simple letters. Chen Shibin, a learning model in the division, has learned over 2,000 characters. Soldier Cai He, who previously only knew just over 100 characters, has learned over 1,000 characters after three months of study. At the beginning of the learning process, there was a shortage of cultural instructors in the troops, most of whom were graduates of rural primary schools and lacked experience. The soldiers had varying levels of education and ages, and there was a shortage of teaching materials. In some cases, an entire battalion had to share one textbook, which increased the difficulties in learning. However, the officers and soldiers of the division actively explored and adopted the flexible approach of "classroom is everywhere." Many teachers went to the kitchen to teach the cooks to read, while others adopted "visual teaching," teaching whatever they encountered. Many soldiers practiced diligently after class, combining their learning with practical application. For example, when collecting firewood, they would learn the character for "firewood" (柴), and when reclaiming wasteland, they would learn the character for "wasteland" (荒). In this way, they made rapid progress and were generally able to write, speak, and use what they learned. After learning 100 characters, they practiced writing articles and letters, learning as they wrote. In the learning process, the soldiers automatically formed "mutual teaching and testing" groups. Those who knew something would teach others, and those who didn't know would ask others. Sometimes they would test each other. Learning model Li Yusen learned 1,000 characters himself and also taught everyone in his class 500 characters each. In addition, each company used wall newspapers, meetings, broadcasts, progress charts, and honorary plaques to promptly commend those who studied well and criticize those who were not active, greatly boosting the soldiers' enthusiasm for learning. Currently, a cultural learning upsurge is continuing to unfold enthusiastically throughout the division. In addition to practicing their skills and performing duties, the officers and soldiers engage in cultural and political learning every day.

　　某师“到处是课堂”
    学习模范陈士彬学会两千多字
    【新华社讯】华北人民解放军某师采用灵活联系实际的方式展开文化学习运动，收到很大的效果。现全师指战员都认识一百五十个字以上，百分之五十的人已能写简单的信件。该师学习模范陈士彬学会了两千多字，战士蔡和以前只识一百多字，经过三个月的学习，已认识了一千多字。学习开始时，因部队中文化教员缺乏，大多是农村小学毕业，且缺乏经验，战士们文化水平、年龄参差不齐，教材短少，甚至有的课一营合用一本课本，增加了学习中很多困难，但该师指战员积极摸索，采用了“到处是课堂”的灵活方式，很多教员到伙房教炊事员识字，有的则采取“形象教学”，碰到什么教什么字。很多战士在下课后随时结合实际认真练习，如打柴就学“柴”字，开荒就学“荒”字，这样进步很快，一般都能做到会写会讲会用。会一百个字后，就练习写稿、写信，边写边学。学习中战士们自动形成“互教互测”，自己会了就教别人，不会就问别人，有时就互相测验。学习模范李玉森自己学会了一千字，还教会了全班每人五百字。此外，各连并通过墙报、会议、广播、升降榜、光荣匾等方式，及时表扬学习好的，批评不积极的，大大提高了战士们的学习情绪。现全师文化学习热潮，正继续热烈展开，指战员们每天除了练技术，值勤务外，即进行文化、政治的学习。
