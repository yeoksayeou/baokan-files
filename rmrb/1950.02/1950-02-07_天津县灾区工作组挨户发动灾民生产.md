　　Tianjin County Disaster Area Work Team
　　Mobilizes Disaster Victims for Production House by House
　　[This newspaper dispatch] Cadres of Tianjin County, Hebei Province, went deep into the disaster villages to mobilize disaster victims for production, house by house. On January 3rd, various institutions and organizations in Tianjin County dispatched cadres to form three work teams, which went to the severely affected areas of the fifth, eighth, and ninth districts to launch a crash program of production and disaster relief work. According to the characteristics of scattered and diverse sideline production in the county, each work team adopted a method of starting from small things. The ninth district focused on Zhu Tangzhuang as a key village, first studying the living conditions of all the villagers with the village cadres, house by house. The village had a total of 223 households, of which 86 households lacked labor, tools, and capital and could not produce. The work team assisted the village cadres in convening a forum of these households with production difficulties, and studied and implemented methods for self-salvation through production, house by house. Wang Fuchang had livestock and a cart but no capital, and was waiting for government relief. The village cadres discussed with him and said, "Don't you still have twenty bundles of firewood? Can't you sell them as capital?" This immediately reminded him. Liu Xuesi also had no capital, and Liu Yuxing, who knew how to treat fish, said to him, "You can pick our fish to sell first, and pay us back after you sell them." After helping each household to make specific plans, most of the households with production difficulties in this village had production avenues, and two households that had no production conditions were also helped to find ways to survive.
　　When the work team first arrived in Dasi Village in the fifth district, they couldn't even hold a mass meeting. After a thorough understanding, they learned that because the cadres had not solved practical problems for the masses in the past, the masses had lost confidence in the leadership of some district-level cadres. The district had called on disaster victims to spin wool. The disaster victims prepared seven spinning wheels, but more than two months later, the wool had not yet been found. They also called on disaster victims to beat reeds in Huangtang in the third district. The disaster victims spent more than 80,000 yuan to buy ten leather pants, but waited a month without any news. The small loan application forms were filled out, and the borrowers ran three times without getting the money. After the work team discovered this, they first solved these problems. They consulted with the county government and organized 27 people from Dasi Village to beat reeds in the third district. They contacted the supply and marketing cooperative to solve the problem of small grain loans of 840 kilograms. They also agreed with the Huidui paper mill to send two large carts to transport reeds to the paper mill. In this way, the poorest 70 disaster-stricken households all had access to production.

　　天津县灾区工作组
    挨户发动灾民生产
    【本报讯】河北省天津县干部深入灾村，逐户发动灾民生产。一月三日，天津县各机关团体抽调干部组成三个工作组，分赴五、八、九三个重灾区突击生产救灾工作。各工作组根据本县副业生产零散而又多样的特点，采取了从点滴入手的做法。九区以朱唐庄为重点村，先和村干部逐户研究全村群众的生活情况。该村共有二百二十三户，有八十六户缺少劳力、工具、资本，不能生产。工作组协助村干部，召集这些生产困难户开座谈会，逐户研究贯彻生产自救的办法。王福昌有牲口有车没资本，等着政府救济，村干部和他商量说：“你不是还有二十捆柴禾吗？卖了作本不行吗？”一下就提醒了他。刘学思也没有资本，会治鱼的刘玉兴对他说：“你先挑我们的鱼去卖，卖了再给钱。”经过挨门逐户的具体帮助作计划，这个村里的生产困难户绝大部分有了生产门路，有两户实无生产条件的，也帮助他们想出求生的办法。
    工作组刚到五区大寺村，连个群众会都开不起来，经过深入了解，才知道因为过去干部没给群众解决实际问题，群众对有些区级干部的领导失去信心。区里曾号召灾民纺羊毛，灾民们准备了七辆纺车，至今两个多月，羊毛还没有找到。又号召灾民到三区黄塘打苇，灾民们花了八万多元买了十条皮裤，等了一个月还没有信。小本贷款填好了表，贷户连跑了三趟也没贷钱来。工作组发现了，首先解决这些问题。和县政府研究好，组织大寺村二十七个人，到三区打苇子。和供销社接洽好，解决小本贷粮八百四十斤。又和灰堆纸厂商定，去两辆大车给纸厂运苇子。这样使最贫苦的七十户灾民都有了生产门路。
