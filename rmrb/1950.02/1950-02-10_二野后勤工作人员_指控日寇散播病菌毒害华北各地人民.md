Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, February 9th: The commanders and fighters of the First and Second Field Armies of the People's Liberation Army, and the staff of their respective organs, resolutely support the Soviet government's note on the trial of Japanese bacterial warfare criminals headed by Hirohito. The staff of the Second Field Army Health Department unanimously accused the Japanese troops of spreading infectious germs such as plague and typhoid in Xinxiang, Hua County, and Jun County in the Jinji-Luyu Border Region, and in Hequ, Baode, Xing County, and Lan County in the Jin-Sui Border Region during the war of aggression against China. They pointed out that after the Japanese troops "mopped up" the Jin-Sui Border Region in 1942, local health authorities discovered sporadic plague patients in Hequ and Baode, resulting in dozens of deaths. It was only through the assistance of local military and government health authorities in isolating the people and cutting off transportation that the spread was prevented. Plague had never been found in the area before. The PLA health authorities discovered devices used by the enemy to spread typhoid germs in Xinxiang, where dozens of local people died from typhoid. In addition to this, the Japanese troops also put poison in wells and food. The staff of the Second Field Army Health Department called on progressive medical workers around the world to unite against warmongers using scientific achievements to harm humanity, and demanded that Japanese war criminals who used medical bacteriology to harm peaceful people be severely punished. The commanders and fighters of a certain regiment stationed in Chongqing under the Second Field Army are even more indignant that these heinous Japanese war criminals are still at large under the protection of American imperialism. Director Huang of the Ordnance Department of the Second Field Army, who persisted in the eight-year War of Resistance Against Japan in the Taihang area, said: "The Japanese troops implemented the 'Three Alls Policy' in the liberated areas at that time, spraying corrosive poisonous gas everywhere and throwing infectious germs in many places, causing the tragic deaths of many people. We resolutely support the Soviet note and demand the swift trial of Japanese war criminals headed by Hirohito." The commanders and fighters of various departments believe that the Chinese people and the Chinese People's Liberation Army, who have suffered the most from the Japanese war of aggression, are the most qualified judges and witnesses. Eighteen well-known combat heroes of a certain army of the First Field Army unanimously supported the Soviet proposal. Model nurse Zhang Jinyu, who has been awarded six major merits, said: "These criminals who use bacteria to kill people should be tried and convicted quickly." Deputy Battalion Commander Hua Hongkun, a artillery hero, Company Commander Zhang Baoying, a special-class combat hero, and Ji Dongcai, a reconnaissance hero, fought in various parts of North China during the War of Resistance Against Japan and witnessed the various crimes of the Japanese troops. They unanimously and resolutely supported the trial of Japanese bacterial warfare criminals headed by Hirohito, and pointed out that this just trial is a serious warning to war-mongers who attempt to create war.

    指控日寇散播病菌毒害华北各地人民
    【新华社北京九日电】人民解放军第一、第二野战军指战员和所属各机关的工作人员，坚决拥护苏联政府关于审讯以裕仁为首的日本细菌战犯的照会。第二野战军卫生部的工作人员一致指控：日寇在侵略中国战争期中，曾在晋冀鲁豫边区的新乡、滑县、浚县，晋绥边区的河曲、保德、兴县、岚县等区，散布鼠疫、伤寒等传染病菌。他们指出：一九四二年日寇“扫荡”晋绥边区后，当地卫生机关即在河曲、保德一带发现散在性鼠疫患者，死数十人，经当地军政卫生机关协助人民隔离，断绝交通，始免于蔓延。该处在这以前从未发现鼠疫传染病。解放军卫生机关曾在新乡发现敌人散播伤寒菌的装置，当地人民因伤寒致死的数十人。除此而外，日寇还在井中、食物中置毒。二野卫生部的工作人员号召全世界进步的医药工作者，一致起来反对好战分子利用科学的成果来残害人类，并要求严惩利用医学细菌学的成果来残害和平人民的日本战犯。第二野战军驻重庆某团指战员对于这些罪恶滔天的日本战犯们，至今仍在美帝国主义的庇护下逍遥法外，更加激愤。曾在太行区坚持八年抗日战争的二野军械处黄处长说：“日寇对当时的解放区施行‘三光政策’，到处喷射糜烂性毒瓦斯，并在许多地方投掷传染病菌，不少人民因此惨死。我们坚决拥护苏联的照会，迅速审判以裕仁为首的日本战犯。”各部指战员认为：饱受日寇侵略战争灾害的中国人民和中国人民解放军是最有资格的审判人和见证人。第一野战军某军十八位著名的战斗英雄一致拥护苏联的建议。立过六次大功的模范护士长张金玉说：“这帮用细菌来杀人的罪犯，应该很快地审判定罪。”炮兵英雄滑宏坤副营长、特等战斗英雄张保英连长、侦察英雄吉栋材，在抗日战争中转战华北各地，目睹日寇种种罪行，一致坚决拥护审判以裕仁为首的细菌战犯，并指出这一正义的审判，对于企图制造战争的战争贩子们是一个严重的警告。
