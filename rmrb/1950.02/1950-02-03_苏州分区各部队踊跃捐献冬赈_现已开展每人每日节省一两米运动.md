　　Suzhou Military District Units Actively Donate to Winter Relief
    Campaign to Save One or Two Liang of Rice Per Person Per Day Now Underway
    [Reported by this newspaper] The armed forces at all levels of the Suzhou Military District of the East China Military Region of the People's Liberation Army have highly promoted the fine qualities of the people's army and enthusiastically donated to winter relief. In the month from mid-December of last year, they donated a total of 5,019,850 yuan in Renminbi, 2 silver dollars, 5,500 jin of rice, 1,070 jin of straw, 236 pairs of socks, 190 pairs of shoes, 178 towels, 431 bars of soap, 232 pieces of clothing and bedding, and 627 packages of tooth powder. This donation to winter relief once again fully demonstrated the mass perspective of the people's army. The cadre meeting of the units directly under the military district originally decided to focus on collective savings in food rations (within one jin) for donation and not to propose individual savings for cash donations. However, the majority of comrades, in order to support the disaster-stricken people, still took out their meager allowances, technical subsidies, and disability pensions to enthusiastically donate. Soldiers in Kunshan Chengxiang District proposed: "We are well-fed and warmly clothed, so we must not forget the suffering of our hungry and cold compatriots." Units in Taicang generally donated straw for heating, saying: "The disaster situation is so serious, why do we need heating?" Cook Cai Sanlang of the teaching brigade said: "Only the poor know the suffering of the poor!" and immediately donated 3,000 yuan in Renminbi and many daily necessities. The political department of the military district has now concentrated the above-mentioned funds and items and handed them over to the government for disaster relief to the people in southern and northern Jiangsu.
    Currently, the military district's units, in response to the "Emergency Instructions on Production and Savings to Help Poor Military Dependents Overcome the Spring Famine" from the East China Military Region and the Political Department of the Third Field Army, have launched a campaign to save one or two liang of rice per person per day.

　　苏州分区各部队踊跃捐献冬赈
    现已开展每人每日节省一两米运动
    【本报讯】人民解放军华东军区苏州军分区各级武装部队，高度发扬了人民部队的优秀品质，热烈捐献冬赈。从去年十二月中旬起一个月中，共捐献了人民币五百○一万九千八百五十元、银元二枚、大米五千五百斤、草一千○七十斤、袜子二百三十六双、鞋子一百九十双、毛巾一百七十八条、肥皂四百三十一块、衣被二百三十二件及牙粉六百二十七包。在这一捐献冬赈工作中，再一次充分地显现人民部队的群众观念。分区直属各单位干部会，本决定以集体节约伙食粮（一斤以内）捐献为主，不提出个人节约献金。但大多数同志为了支援灾胞，还是抽出微薄的津贴、技贴、残废金来踊跃捐献。昆山城厢区战士提出：“我们吃饱穿暖，就不能忘掉饥寒同胞的苦楚。”太仓各单位普遍献出了烤火草，他们说：“灾情如此严重，我们何用烤火？”教导大队炊事员蔡三郎说：“穷人的痛苦，只有穷人才知道！”立即捐出人民币三千元及日用品多件。现分区政治部已将上述款额及物件，集中交由政府赈救苏南及苏北灾胞。
    现该分区各部队为响应华东军区及第三野战军政治部“生产节约，协助贫苦军属渡过春荒的紧急指示”，已开展每人每日节省一两米运动。
