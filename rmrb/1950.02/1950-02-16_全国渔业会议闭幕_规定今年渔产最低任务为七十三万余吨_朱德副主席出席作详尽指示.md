Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, February 14th: The first National Fisheries Conference, lasting eight days, concluded on the 13th. Before the closing, Song Yuhe, Vice Minister of the Food Industry Department, delivered a summary report. Vice Chairman Zhu De of the Central People's Government also attended and gave instructions.

In his summary report, Vice Minister Song pointed out: The general principle for national fishery production in 1950 is to focus on recovery. Under this general principle, the minimum target for national fishery production this year is 736,000 tons. Vice Minister Song called on all regions to ensure the completion of the task and put forward the following specific implementation methods and steps:

	Actively Build State-Owned Aquatic Enterprises; Organize Fishermen's Cooperative Economy

(1) It is necessary to actively build state-owned aquatic enterprises, so that they can recover and develop in a short period of time; at the same time, make great efforts to support the old-style individual fishermen's production and organize them into a cooperative economy. For private fisheries, the labor-capital relations issues should be appropriately handled in accordance with the principles of taking into account both public and private interests, benefiting both labor and capital, developing production, and promoting economic prosperity. In addition, in accordance with the principle of encouraging production, fish prices should be appropriately stipulated, an incentive system should be implemented, and fishing grounds should be resolutely protected, fish breeding should be protected, and production should be protected.

(2) Establish and improve fishery organizations at all levels. The Ministry of Food Industry of the Central Government has established the General Administration of Aquatic Affairs, as the highest organization directly managing national aquatic affairs. In addition, the governments of major administrative regions should establish aquatic affairs administration bureaus, and the provincial governments should establish aquatic affairs bureaus or offices at their discretion, depending on the level of fishery development in the province. In coastal, riverside, river, lakeside and southern pond and paddy field areas, the special commissioner's office and county government can set up aquatic affairs sections to manage the aquatic affairs within their jurisdiction. State-owned aquatic enterprises should establish specialized institutions for managing state-owned enterprises under the General Administration in accordance with the principle of centralized leadership and decentralized management.

	Improve Fishery Organizations at All Levels; Unify Leadership; Strengthen Employee Education

(3) The policy of state-owned aquatic enterprises is to increase output, improve quality, strengthen management, reduce costs, develop manufacturing, expand domestic sales, strive for exports, control fish prices, regulate the market, support cooperatives through supply and marketing, improve technology, and strengthen employee education. State-owned aquatic enterprises should make full use of existing production tools for production on the basis of existing conditions and possibilities; at the same time, they should strengthen scientific organization, operation and management.

(4) Unify the fishery equipment in various parts of the country and appropriately adjust materials to facilitate the development of aquatic undertakings in the future.

(5) Provide fishermen with necessary loans, issue loans through democratic evaluation among fishermen, and in units of fishermen groups.

(6) Prepare to formulate unified national fishery regulations.

During the meeting, Vice Chairman Zhu De of the Central People's Government attended and spoke. Vice Chairman Zhu gave detailed instructions on issues such as organization, unified leadership, fish prices, transportation and sales, incentive manufacturing, and science and technology. Finally, Vice Chairman Zhu encouraged everyone to carry out this work together in a planned and organized manner under the leadership of the Ministry of Food Industry, and to ensure that this work is done well.

　　全国渔业会议闭幕
    规定今年渔产最低任务为七十三万余吨
    朱德副主席出席作详尽指示
    【新华社北京十四日电】首届全国渔业会议，历时八天，已于十三日闭幕。闭幕前由食品工业部宋裕和副部长作总结报告。中央人民政府朱德副主席也出席指示。
    宋副部长在总结报告中指出：一九五○年全国渔业生产的总方针是以恢复为主。在总的方针下，今年全国渔业生产的最低任务为七十三万六千吨。宋副部长要求各地保证任务的完成，并提出了以下具体的实施方法和步骤：
    积极建设国营水产企业  组织渔民合作经济
    （一）要积极地建设国营水产企业，使其在短时间内由恢复到发展；同时也以极大的努力去扶持旧式的个体渔民生产，组织起来成为合作经济。对于私营渔业，要依据公私兼顾、劳资两利、发展生产、繁荣经济的原则，适当地处理劳资关系问题。此外，要根据鼓励生产的原则，适当地规定鱼价，实行奖励制度，并坚决保护渔场，保护渔类繁殖，保护生产。
    （二）建立并健全各级渔业组织机构。中央食品工业部下设水产事业管理总局，作为直接管理全国水产事业的最高组织。此外，各大行政区政府设水产事业管理局，各省政府依该省渔业发达程度，酌情设水产局或处，在沿海、沿江、沿河、沿湖及南方池塘、水田地区，专署、县府可设水产科，以管理所辖境内的水产事业。国营水产企业则依据集中领导、分散经营的原则，在总局之下设管理国营企业的专门机构。
    健全各级渔业  组织统一领导  加强职工教育
    （三）国营水产企业的方针是增加产量、提高质量，加强管理、减低成本，发展制造业、扩展内销、争取出口，掌握鱼价、调剂市场，通过供销、扶持合作社，改进技术，加强职工教育。国营水产企业应在现有的基础和可能的条件下，尽量利用现有生产工具从事生产；同时应加强科学化的组织、经营和管理。
    （四）统一全国各地的渔业设备，适当地调剂物资，以利于今后水产事业的发展。
    （五）给渔民以必要的贷款，通过渔民间的民主评定方式来发放贷款，并以渔民小组为单位。
    （六）准备制订全国统一的渔业条例。
    会议期间，中央人民政府朱德副主席出席讲话。朱副主席对组织起来、统一领导、鱼价、运销、奖励制造、科学技术等问题都作了详尽的指示。朱副主席最后勉励大家在食品工业部领导下，共同有计划有组织地来进行这一工作，并保证把这工作做好。
