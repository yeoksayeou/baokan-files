Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, 12th—The People's Liberation Army liberated Songpan, an important town in Northwest Sichuan, on the 9th of this month. The remnant Kuomintang bandits of the 20th Army, who had been roaming around the area and Maoxian County, have been largely eliminated. On January 26th, Jing Jiamo, the acting commander of the army, surrendered to our People's Liberation Army in northern Sichuan with the 133rd Division, under the pressure of our massive army and after repeated persuasions to surrender. However, the other part, the 134th Division, stubbornly refused to come to their senses, vainly attempting to occupy remote mountainous areas and carry out harassment. A unit of our People's Liberation Army immediately and resolutely launched a campaign to suppress them, liberating Songpan County on the 9th of this month and annihilating the majority of the bandit 134th Division that refused to surrender, capturing more than 800 of them. The remnant bandits fled in disarray, and we are pursuing and annihilating them.

　　川西北解放松潘
    残匪廿军一师投降另一师大部就歼
    【新华社成都十二日电】人民解放军于本月九日解放川西北重镇松潘。流窜该地和茂县一带的国民党残匪二十军已大部被解决。上月二十六日，该军代军长景嘉谟在我人民解放军大军压境和数次劝降下，率一三三师于川北向我投降，但另部一三四师仍执迷不悟，妄图盘踞偏僻山区进行骚扰。我人民解放军某部当即坚决进剿，于本月九日一举解放松潘县城，将拒不投降之匪一三四师大部歼灭，俘其八百余名。残匪狼狈逃窜，我正追歼中。
