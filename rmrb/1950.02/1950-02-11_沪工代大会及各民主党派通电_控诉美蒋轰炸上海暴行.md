　　Shanghai Workers' Congress and Democratic Parties Issue Circular Telegram, Condemning US-Chiang Kai-shek Bombing Atrocities in Shanghai

    Shanghai citizens from all walks of life are condemning the US-Chiang Kai-shek's insane bombing of Shanghai. The circular telegram passed by the Shanghai Workers' Congress on the 7th stated: "On behalf of millions of workers, we lodge a serious accusation to the people of the whole country and the world: Just as our Shanghai Workers' Congress was in session, the Chiang Kai-shek remnant bandit gang, with the direct participation of US imperialism and Japanese aggressors, used a large number of American-made planes and bombs to carry out a crazy bombing of Shanghai. Over a hundred of our fellow workers at the Shanghai Power Company were killed or injured, and over a thousand citizens from all walks of life were killed or injured, with over 50,000 citizens affected; water, electricity, and transportation facilities suffered serious damage. What a shockingly inhumane and shameless atrocity! We Shanghai workers deeply recognize that this kind of atrocity is only the desperate struggle of the remnant Kuomintang bandit gang before its death, and it will never stop our victory and progress. We, the Shanghai working class, have never been intimidated by the enemy's threats in the long struggle against the Kuomintang reactionary rule and against imperialism. We won, and the enemy fell. Although the enemy's atrocities have temporarily caused us serious difficulties, we must carry forward the past fighting traditions and, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the People's Government, stand on the front line of the anti-bombing and anti-sabotage struggle! We must unite with other classes to assist the government and take all concrete actions to declare war on atrocities! Declare war on difficulties! We must make the greatest efforts to support the front lines, liberate the Zhoushan Islands and Taiwan, fight for the construction of a new Shanghai and a new China, and avenge the dead!"
    The Kuomintang Revolutionary Committee Shanghai-Nanjing District Temporary Working Committee, the China Democratic League Shanghai Branch, the China Democratic National Construction Association Shanghai Temporary Working Committee, the China Association for Promoting Democracy Shanghai Branch, and the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party Shanghai Working Committee and other democratic parties jointly issued a circular telegram on the 9th, stating: We stand on the position of democracy and justice and lodge a serious protest and denunciation against the extremely shameless and barbaric behavior of the US-Chiang Kai-shek. We believe that this atrocity represents not only a desperate struggle of the Kuomintang reactionaries before their death, but also the US imperialism's attempt to intimidate the Chinese people and hinder their continued progress through this atrocity at a time when the Chinese people have achieved an unprecedented great victory. We want to solemnly tell US imperialism and its running dog Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang that the Chinese people will not be intimidated by this threat. The strength of the Chinese people becomes stronger when it encounters obstacles; it becomes greater when it encounters disturbances. We have a clearer understanding of the conspiracy of US imperialism from this bombing. We know that this US-Chiang Kai-shek atrocity is only a concrete manifestation of US imperialism's consistent anti-people democracy, anti-humanitarianism, and anti-progress. US imperialism openly protects the bacteriological warfare criminals headed by the Japanese Emperor, stubbornly supports the position of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit representative in the United Nations, and massively manufactures murderous atomic weapons, plotting to prepare for war. All these things only increase the Chinese people's anger and contempt for US imperialism and its running dog Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, and only strengthen the Chinese people's determination to expel imperialism, eliminate the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, and rapidly complete the liberation of Taiwan and the liberation of all of China. This is our common goal, and it is the only answer of the Chinese people to the bombing behavior of US imperialism and its running dog Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang.
    The Shanghai Xinwen Ribao (Shanghai News Daily) also published an editorial today entitled "Recognize the Enemy and Launch the Struggle Against Bombing and Sabotage," pointing out that US imperialism, Japanese aggressors, and the remnant Kuomintang bandit gang have become the common enemies of all peaceful citizens of Shanghai, calling on everyone to immediately take all necessary measures such as air defense, fire prevention, and anti-espionage, to carry forward the spirit of heroic mutual assistance, to continue production, and to launch a struggle against bombing and sabotage.

　　沪工代大会及各民主党派通电
    控诉美蒋轰炸上海暴行
    【新华社上海十日电】上海市各界人民控诉美蒋对上海的疯狂轰炸。沪市工人代表大会七日通过的通电称：“我们代表百万工人向全国和全世界人民提出严重控诉：正当我们上海市市工人代表大会开会期间，蒋介石残余匪帮在美帝国主义及日本侵略者直接参预之下，用大批美国制造的飞机和炸弹，对上海进行了疯狂的轰炸。我们上海电力公司工友死伤百余人，各界人民死伤一千数百人，受灾市民共达五万多人；水电交通设备受到了严重的损害。这是何等绝灭人性的无耻暴行！我们上海工人深切认识到：这种暴行只是国民党匪帮残余垂死前的绝望挣扎，它绝不能阻止我们的胜利与前进。我们上海工人阶级在长期的反国民党反动统治和反帝国主义的斗争中，从来也没有被敌人的威胁所吓退。我们胜利了，敌人倒下去了。敌人的暴行，虽然暂时给我们以严重的困难，但我们一定要发扬过去斗争传统，在中国共产党和人民政府领导下，站在反轰炸、反破坏斗争的最前线。我们一定要团结其他阶层协助政府，采取一切具体行动，向暴行宣战！向困难宣战！我们一定以最大的努力，来支援前线，解放舟山群岛和台湾，为建设新上海和新中国而斗争，为死难者复仇！”
    中国国民党革命委员会沪宁区临时工作委员会、中国民主同盟上海市支部、民主建国会上海临时工作委员会、中国民主促进会上海分会及中国农工民主党上海工作委员会等各民主党派，于九日联合发表通电称：我们站在民主和正义的立场，对美蒋这种极端无耻的野蛮残暴行为提出严重的抗议和申斥。我们认为这种暴行所代表的，不仅是国民党反动派在死亡以前的一种绝望的挣扎，而且是美帝国主义在中国人民空前大胜利的时候，想通过这种暴行，恫吓中国人民和阻挠中国人民继续向前发展。我们要正告美帝国主义以及它的走狗蒋匪帮，中国人民是不会被这种威胁所吓倒的。中国人民的力量是愈遇到阻挠就愈加坚强；愈遇到扰乱就愈加壮大。我们从这一次轰炸中更清楚地认识了美帝国主义的阴谋。我们知道这一次的美蒋暴行只是美帝国主义一贯的反人民民主、反人道、反进步的具体表现。美帝国主义公然袒护以日本天皇为首的细菌战犯，死硬地在联合国里支持蒋匪代表的地位，并且大量制造杀人原子武器，阴谋准备战争，凡此种种，都只有增加中国人民对于美帝国主义及其走狗蒋匪帮的愤怒和唾弃，只有加强中国人民驱逐帝国主义消灭蒋匪帮和迅速完成解放台湾、解放全中国的决心。这是我们共同努力的目标，也是中国人民对于美帝国主义及其走狗蒋匪帮滥炸行为的唯一回答。
    上海新闻日报今日亦以“认清敌人，展开反轰炸破坏的斗争”为题发表社论，指出美帝国主义、日本侵略分子与国民党残余匪帮，已成为上海全体和平市民的共同敌人，号召大家立刻采取防空、防火、防特等一切必要措置，发挥英勇互助精神，继续生产，展开一个反轰炸破坏的斗争。
