　　Capital Dong'an and Other Malls
    Implement Clearly Marked Prices for Goods
    Xidan and Other Malls Should Earnestly Achieve Clear and Fair Transactions
    [Our Newspaper's Report] Since the end of last year, several malls in the capital have begun implementing clearly marked prices for goods, and in the past month or so, initial achievements have been made. In Dong'an Market, the phenomenon of merchants asking exorbitant prices has now disappeared. Merchants have automatically installed loudspeakers to promote to the market: "Customers are welcome to report merchants in this market who ask exorbitant prices!" They are also carrying out persuasion work with jewelry and jade merchants who do not fully agree with clear and fair transactions, so that everyone consciously abides by the regulations and maintains the reputation of the entire market. The Dongdan People's Market, where vendors have always "asked for the sky-high price," and customers who "don't know the market" often spend more money and get cheated. This market also began implementing clearly marked prices in mid-January. Initially, some vendors changed verbal lies into written lies. The management office then made many wooden signs, with the words "This stall is asking exorbitant prices; customers beware" written on them to show punishment. In this way, written lies were quickly eliminated. Now the market has implemented fair transactions. The number of transactions has also gradually increased. According to a survey by the management office, on the first day of implementing clear and fair transactions, 41 bicycles were sold in the bicycle market. On the fourth and fifth days, an average of 60 bicycles were sold each day, and on the sixth and seventh days, 80 bicycles were sold each day. The situation in other industries is generally the same.
    However, in terms of other malls in the capital, they generally have not done well. Although Xidan Market, Xian Nong Tan People's Market, Beigouyan, Huangchenggen, Xuanwumen and other markets have all tried it out one after another, many vendors still have not marked their prices clearly. Or even if they have marked their prices, it is merely a formality. There is still a considerable gap between the marked price and the actual selling price.
    The marked price of the Xidan vegetable market is a blackboard hung at the entrance of the vegetable market, with the prices of chicken, duck, fish, and meat written on it. Most vendors have not marked their own goods. Therefore, the phenomenon of asking exorbitant prices is still prevalent. In addition, some malls only offer marked prices to people in yellow and gray uniforms, while for ordinary citizens, they still bargain according to old habits. These situations are partly due to some practical difficulties that are difficult to overcome, such as the difficulty in pricing used goods. But on the other hand, it is also because the management cadres of some malls are only calling for it and have not seriously inspected it. In addition, some cadres believe that vendors ask exorbitant prices "because customers want to bargain"; or that clear and fair transactions "are not applicable to small vendors." To implement this work, these ideological problems must be thoroughly resolved. (Yu)

### 首都东安等商场  实行明码标价售货  西单等商场应切实做到明码交易

　　首都东安等商场
    实行明码标价售货
    西单等商场应切实做到明码交易
    【本报讯】首都若干商场从去年年底开始实行明码标价售货，月余以来，已获初步成绩。在东安市场，商人要谎价的现象现已绝迹。商人们自动装设扩音器，向市场宣传：“欢迎主顾检举本商场要谎价的商人！”并向思想上不大同意明码交易的珠宝玉器商进行说服工作，使大家都自觉遵守规定，维护全商场的信誉。东单人民商场，摊商们一向是“漫天要价”，“不懂眼”的顾客，常有多花钱和受骗的。该商场于一月中旬亦开始实行明码标价。初时，曾有些摊贩把口头谎变为文字谎。管理处乃制出许多木牌，牌上写着“此摊要谎；顾客小心”，以示处罚。这样，文字谎也很快被消灭了。现该商场已实行了公平交易。成交数量，也随之日渐增加。据管理处调查，在实行明码交易的第一天，自行车市成交的车子四十一辆，第四、五天平均每日达六十辆，第六、七天每日即达八十辆。其他行业，情形也大体相同。
    但从首都其他商场来说，则一般还未做好。西单商场、先农坛人民市场、北沟沿、皇城根、宣武门等市场，虽都先后试行，但有许多商贩至今仍未明码标价。或虽明码标价，却是空具形式。标价与实售价之间仍有相当距离。
    西单菜市的标价，则是以一块黑板挂在菜市口上，上面写了些鸡、鸭、鱼、肉的价格。各商贩自己的货物上则多未标出。故要谎价现象仍旧盛行。另外有些商场，其标价只对黄色和灰色制服的人有效，对一般市民，则仍按旧习惯讨价还价。这些情形，一方面是由于有些实际困难较难克服，如旧货难于定价等。但另一方面，也由于有些商场的管理干部仅是号召，没有认真检查所致，另外有些干部，则认为商贩要谎是“由于顾客要还价”；或认为明码交易“对小商贩不适用”。要贯彻这一工作，必须彻底解决这些思想问题。（羽）
