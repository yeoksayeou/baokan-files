　　【This Newspaper Reported】The North China People's Revolutionary University recently reorganized the organization for cadres' spare-time Russian learning, divided classes according to proficiency and voluntary principles, and determined to adopt a self-study-based learning method. When the cadres of the school began to learn Russian, 564 people signed up to participate in the study, accounting for 62% of the total number of cadres. Many comrades had extremely high enthusiasm for learning and were able to attend meetings and classes on time. Many people also went to other classes to listen repeatedly, and each class exceeded the original number by more than double. Later, due to the learning summary, the Russian learning was interrupted for a while, and some cadres were transferred, so the learning enthusiasm was not as good as before after the Russian class was resumed. In some classes, only 80 people attended out of 120, and the least only had more than 50 people; most of the cadres in some departments were unwilling to continue learning; some returned their textbooks and asked to drop out. The general reflection was: "The progress is too fast to keep up," "The alphabet has not been fully memorized, and the phonetic alphabet has not been learned well," "The foundation has not been laid well," and so on. In order to improve future learning, the school held a joint meeting of class teachers and instructors, and a meeting of learning representatives from various departments and offices to discuss reorganizing the Russian learning organization, clarifying the educational policy, and improving teaching methods. It was determined to divide the classes into two types, A and B, with a limit of 100 to 120 people per class. Conditions for class arrangement: Class A: Those who have more than three years of foreign language foundation, have considerable cultural and theoretical level; or those who have a poor foreign language foundation but can keep up with the study and are willing to join; Class B: Those who have considerable cultural and theoretical level and about one year of foreign language foundation, or those who have no foreign language foundation, but are active and enthusiastic and determined to learn. Each class has one head and one deputy head to be responsible for leading the study. At the same time, in teaching, it was decided to adopt a realistic policy of persisting to the end, with the aim of enabling Class A to be able to self-study and translate general political books, newspapers, and magazines within one year; and Class B to achieve the goal of self-studying Russian readers. The teaching progress is determined to be one semester every three months. In the first and second semesters of Class A, the "Russian Reader" published by Shanghai Shidai Publishing House will be used on the current basis to complete 22 lessons; in the third and fourth semesters, the Soviet version of "Intermediate Russian Reader" will be used. Class B will complete 22 lessons of the "Russian Reader" throughout the year. The specific progress will be determined separately by the teachers. The learning method is based on self-study and supplemented by lectures; at the same time, the spirit of mutual assistance, mutual teaching and mutual learning is promoted. In addition, a strict learning system has been established, and students must attend classes on time and abide by learning discipline.
