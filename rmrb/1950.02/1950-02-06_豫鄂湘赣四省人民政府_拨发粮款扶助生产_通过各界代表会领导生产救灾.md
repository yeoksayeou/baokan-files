Xinhua News Agency, Hankou, 5th: The production and disaster relief work in the four provinces of Henan, Hubei, Hunan, and Jiangxi in the Central South region has achieved initial success. Local governments are now continuing to lead the people in production and disaster relief in order to completely overcome the famine. The aforementioned four provinces suffered from severe floods, droughts, insect pests, hail, and other disasters last year. The disaster areas accounted for one-sixth of the total cultivated land area of the four provinces, and the affected population reached approximately ten million. After the disasters occurred, local governments immediately led the disaster victims in production for self-relief, first allocating a large number of loans to support the disaster victims in sideline production with a focus, enabling more than one million disaster victims to find ways to produce. Among them, Henan Province loaned out 2.1 billion yuan. In Luoyang County, a cotton-producing area, 100,000 spinning wheels were organized, capable of weaving 100,000 bolts of cloth per month. In XinZheng and Changge counties along the Pinghan Railway, more than 6,000 people contracted with the Zhengzhou Railway Bureau to quarry ballast, earning wages of 1.2 million catties of grain. In the Huangchuan area north of the Dabie Mountains, 20,000 disaster victims solved their living problems by burning charcoal, collecting herbs, and extracting iron sand. Hubei Province loaned out 200,000 catties of grain, and in the Mianyang Special District, which was severely affected by the disaster, organized disaster victims to engage in fishing, firewood gathering, net weaving, and dike repairs. It is estimated that they can earn more than 35.5 million catties of rice, which can solve the living problems of one million people for two months. Many places combined disaster relief with dike construction by using work as relief. The river dikes in Hubei Province have all started construction. The Ministry of Water Resources of the Central People's Government and the Provincial People's Government have allocated 20 million catties of supplementary grain for dike construction. The dike projects along the lake in eleven counties in Hunan Province and along Poyang Lake in Jiangxi Province have all started construction. The latter has 100,000 civilian workers on the dikes, enabling some disaster victims to maintain their lives. In order to shorten the spring famine, the People's Governments of Hunan, Hubei, Jiangxi and other provinces are vigorously leading farmers to drain water and remove soil to carry out winter cultivation. Anxiang County in Hunan Province drained water to save 500,000 mu of farmland. Echeng in Hubei Province also saved more than 400,000 mu of farmland, ensuring the smooth progress of spring plowing and sowing. In Xiangtan, Changsha, and Pingjiang in Hunan, and Gaoan, Jiujiang, and Nanchang in Jiangxi, the winter cultivation area has more than doubled compared to previous years, and most of them have sown wheat, rapeseed, peas, broad beans and other early-maturing crops. The early-maturing crops in Jiangxi Province have all sprouted.

However, in some areas of the aforementioned provinces, due to the existence of a purely relief-oriented view among leading cadres, they did not actively lead the masses to carry out production for self-relief, or they exaggerated the disaster situation and took a negative attitude towards disaster relief work; some disaster-stricken people also lacked confidence in production for self-relief, waiting for government relief; in addition, the sales channels for sideline products were not well resolved, and the spring famine season was approaching, so the disaster situation was still very serious. About one-tenth of the population in Hubei Province is currently short of food; in Yaoao Village, Haizi District, Luoyang, Henan Province, only one-sixth of the 378 households can maintain their food supply until the wheat harvest. After discovering the above situation, the local people's governments quickly convened all-circles representative conferences, peasant representative conferences, and cadre meetings to discuss and mobilize production and disaster relief, eliminate the purely relief and reliance on relief views among cadres and disaster-stricken people, and specifically studied the methods of production to overcome the famine, enabling cadres and the masses to initially establish confidence in production and self-relief. Local people's governments have issued a large number of grain and loan loans to solve the financial difficulties of mass production; on the one hand, they called on all localities to carry out social mutual assistance and mutual relief, advocating free lending, and calling for a large number of early-maturing crops to be sown in order to shorten the spring famine. In order to solve the problem of sales channels for mass sideline products, the Hubei Provincial Government allocated 50 million catties of grain to purchase farmers' local products in mountainous areas; many areas also established supply and marketing cooperatives in disaster areas to help disaster victims transport and sell sideline products.

　　豫鄂湘赣四省人民政府
    拨发粮款扶助生产
    通过各界代表会领导生产救灾
    【新华社汉口五日电】中南区河南、湖北、湖南、江西四省的生产救灾工作已获得初步成绩，现各地人民政府正继续领导人民进行生产救灾，以便完全战胜灾荒。上述四省去年曾遭受严重的水、旱、虫、雹等灾害，被灾区占四省总耕地面积六分之一，被灾人口约达一千万。灾荒发生后，各地人民政府即领导灾民进行生产自救，首先拨发大批贷款，有重点地扶助灾民进行副业生产，使百余万灾民找到生产门路。其中河南省贷出了二十一亿元，在产棉区的洛阳县组织了十万架纺车，每月能织出十万匹布；沿平汉路的新郑、长葛两县，有六千余人向郑州铁路局包工打石碴，可得工资粮一百二十万斤；大别山北部潢川地区的两万灾民，以烧炭、采药、掏铁砂等办法，解决了生活问题。湖北省贷出粮食二十万斤，在灾情较重的沔阳专区组织灾民进行打渔、打柴、织网、修堤等项生产，预计可收入三千五百余万斤米，能够解决一百万人两个月的生活问题。许多地方在修堤治水中以工代赈，使救灾与修堤工程相结合。湖北省的江河堤防已全部动工。中央人民政府水利部和该省人民政府已分别拨出二千万斤堤工补助粮。湖南省滨湖十一县及江西鄱阳湖岸堤工程都已动工，后者上堤民工达十万人，使部分灾民得以维持生活。为着缩短春荒，湖南、湖北、江西等省人民政府都大力领导农民排水脱地，进行冬耕。湖南安乡县排水救田五十万亩。湖北鄂城也救出田四十余万亩，保证了春耕春种工作的顺利进行。湖南的湘潭、长沙、平江，江西省的高安、九江、南昌等地，冬耕面积都比往年超过一倍，大部播种小麦及油菜、豌豆、蚕豆等早熟作物，江西省的早熟作物已全部出芽。
    但是，上述各省的某些地区，由于领导干部存在着单纯救济观点，不去积极领导群众进行生产自救，或者夸大灾情，对救灾工作抱着消极态度；部分灾民群众也缺乏生产自救信心，坐待政府救济；加之副业产品销路未能很好解决，而春荒季节又已逼近，因而灾情仍很严重。湖北省目前约有十分之一的人口缺粮；河南省洛阳海资区姚凹村三七八户中，吃粮能维持到麦收的仅有六分之一。各地人民政府在发现上述情况之后，已迅速召开各界代表会、农民代表会和干部会等，进行生产救灾的讨论和动员，消除干部和灾民群众中的单纯救济和依赖救济的观点，并具体研究了生产渡荒的办法，使干部和群众初步建立了生产自救的信心。各地人民政府一面发放大批贷粮贷款，解决群众生产资金困难；一面号召各地进行社会互助互济，提倡自由借贷，并号召大量播种早熟作物，以便缩短春荒。为解决群众副业产品销路问题，湖北省府拨粮五千万斤，在山区收购农民土产；有许多地区并在灾区成立供销合作社，扶助灾民运销副业产品。
