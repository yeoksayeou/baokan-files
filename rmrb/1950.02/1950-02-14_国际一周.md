    Japanese Bacteriological Warfare Criminals Must Be Punished

    On February 1st, the Soviet government sent notes to the governments of China, the United States, and the United Kingdom, proposing the appointment of a special international military tribunal to try the heinous Japanese bacteriological warfare criminals Hirohito, Shiro Ishii, Masaji Kitano, Jiro Wakamatsu, and Yukio Kasahara. This note has been fully agreed upon by our government and wholeheartedly supported by the people of our country, who have suffered deeply from their crimes. All peace-loving people around the world also warmly welcome the Soviet government's note because severely punishing the Japanese bacteriological warfare criminals is not only a heavy blow to the Japanese aggressive forces that are being revived under the support of US imperialism, but also a heavy blow to the instigators of a new world war.

    The trial of Japanese bacteriological warfare criminals such as Otozo Yamada in Khabarovsk last December revealed that Hirohito, Ishii, Kitano, Wakamatsu, and Kasahara were the chief culprits in the Japanese imperialists' bacteriological warfare. The Khabarovsk trial also revealed that the Japanese imperialists had not only prepared to wage bacteriological warfare against the Soviet Union, China, and the Mongolian People's Republic, but also against the United States and the United Kingdom. Thus, it is easy to understand that promptly submitting Hirohito and other war criminals who have committed heinous crimes against humanity to a special international military tribunal for trial is not only in the common interest of the Soviet, Chinese, and Mongolian people, but also fully in the interests of the American and British people and the people of the world. However, the US government has taken the completely opposite attitude. At a press conference on February 3, the US State Department's press officer, Mr. McDermott, issued a statement from the State Department declaring that the United States would reject the Soviet note. The US government defends bacteriological warfare criminals such as Hirohito, using as its excuses the "understanding" reached at the Far Eastern Commission meeting on April 3, 1946, which exempted Hirohito from being tried as a war criminal; and the Far Eastern Commission's decision in April 1949, which purportedly ended the war crimes trials long ago. When refuting this lie, Chinese legal expert and former judge of the International Military Tribunal for the Far East, Mei Ru'ao, pointed out that both excuses are distortions of facts and sophistry. In fact, the contents of these two documents of the Far Eastern Commission are not as stated. The Far Eastern Commission's "understanding" of April 3, 1946, only temporarily refrained from listing Hirohito as being indicted at the same time as Tojo, Doihara, and other first batch of twenty-eight top war criminals. This absolutely does not mean never to be put on trial. As for the Far Eastern Commission's resolution of last April, it only hoped that the trials of Japanese war criminals by the member states would be completed as far as possible by the end of last September. This was just a suggestion and does not mean that trials of Japanese war criminals could not continue after last September. This attitude of shielding Japanese war criminals exposes the true face of US imperialism.

    The Conspiracy of the Bangkok Conference

    The "Far East Diplomatic Personnel Conference," which the US imperialists have been preparing for a long time, will be held in Bangkok on February 13. The "diplomatic representatives" of the United States in thirteen countries in the Far East and Southeast Asia have flocked to participate in the conference. Surrounding this conference, US imperialist elements such as Jessup, Butterworth, MacArthur, and Bradley have recently conducted intense activities in Tokyo, Manila, and other places, and held a series of secret meetings.

    According to US Secretary of State Acheson's speech on Asian policy on January 12, and the recent statements and actions of Jessup and others, the purpose of the Bangkok Conference is very clear. With the unprecedented upsurge of national liberation movements in Eastern countries, the great victory of the Chinese revolution, and the victorious development of national liberation wars in Vietnam, South Korea, the Philippines, Indonesia, Malaya, Burma, and other countries, the US imperialists, who are attempting to dominate Southeast Asia, are striving to strengthen their line of aggression from Alaska to the Philippines, and to establish another line of aggression from Indonesia to India. Then, they will link these two lines through organizational forms such as the "Pacific Alliance," with Japan as the "main fortress." The Bangkok Conference is a meeting to discuss how to implement this wild plan. The American diplomatic schemers and warmongers participating in the Bangkok Conference will inevitably plan various conspiracies and tricks to more actively support the United States' agents in Eastern countries, such as Chiang Kai-shek, Syngman Rhee, Phibun Songkhram, Hatta, and Bao Dai, to obstruct the national liberation movements of various countries. Here, concrete measures to oppose the new China and prevent the Chinese People's Liberation Army from finally eliminating the Kuomintang remnants will obviously occupy a primary position in the Bangkok Conference. MacArthur, in his talks with Bradley, openly advocated "taking concrete measures" to assist Taiwan, which has "strategic value." Philippine Defense Minister Connelio flew to Japan on the 9th at MacArthur's call to accept the task of aiding the bandits on Taiwan. These facts show that the measures taken by the United States to use the Philippines as a transshipment line for supplying arms to the bandits and to use the Japanese "volunteer army" to help the Kuomintang remnants slaughter the Chinese people will be further intensified. At the same time, due to the recent developments in Vietnam, concrete plans for the United States to openly participate in the intervention in the Vietnamese national liberation war will also be an important agenda item of the Bangkok Conference. In his speech in Singapore on the 6th, Jessup again expressed the United States' "deep concern" about the situation in Vietnam and claimed that "the United States will provide all assistance, even military assistance, to countries under attack." Jessup's statement exposed the United States' attempt to use Bao Dai and the Kuomintang bandits who fled to Vietnam to establish a military base in Vietnam against the people of China and Vietnam.

    The conspiracy of the Bangkok Conference will be vicious. It should arouse due vigilance from the people of Eastern countries. However, the conspiracy of the Bangkok Conference, like the United States' past conspiracies in China, is bound to fail. More than half of the hundreds of millions of people in the East have broken free from the shackles of imperialism. This great force, coupled with the increasingly powerful national liberation movements in various colonial countries in the East, will inevitably smash any new aggressive plans of US imperialism in the Far East.

    The Situation in Vietnam

    The situation in Vietnam in recent times has been one of the focuses of world attention.

    The Soviet Union, China, and various people's democratic countries have successively announced their decision to establish diplomatic relations with the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. The Vietnamese people and progressive people all over the world celebrate the young republic becoming a member of the camp of peace and democracy. The enhanced international status of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam is the deserved result of the heroic struggle of the Vietnamese people. For more than three years, the Vietnamese people, under the leadership of the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, have victoriously carried out the struggle against French imperialism. The Vietnamese Republic now controls more than 90 percent of the entire Vietnamese territory. Of the total population of more than 20 million, the population in the French-occupied area does not exceed two million. The Vietnamese Republic has established people's committees as organs of power throughout the country, has implemented a 25 percent reduction in rent, and has implemented compulsory national education, and has done a lot of work in eliminating illiteracy.

    In view of the establishment of diplomatic relations between the Soviet Union, China, and the Vietnamese Republic, and the increasing strength of the Vietnamese Republic, the imperialist camp is hurriedly supporting the puppet Bao Dai. The French Senate hurriedly approved the "Franco-Vietnamese Agreement" signed by Bao Dai and Auriol on March 8, 1949, on the first of this month, and the United States and Britain also announced their recognition of the Bao Dai puppet regime on the 7th at the same time. US imperialism is also attempting to openly interfere in the Vietnamese people's war of liberation for national independence by providing military assistance to the Bao Dai regime. However, the Vietnamese people are full of confidence and determination to continue the struggle with all their strength to defeat the conspiracies of international reactionaries and strive for the complete liberation of the country. The support of the American, British, and French imperialists for a "nightclub emperor" like Bao Dai as a puppet precisely illustrates the weakness of the imperialist ruling foundation.

    必须惩办日本细菌战犯
    苏联政府于二月一日向我国政府及美英两国政府提出照会，提议委任国际特别军事法庭，以审判罪恶滔天的日本细菌战犯裕仁、石井四郎、北野政藏、若松次郎、笠原行雄。这一照会已得到我国政府的完全同意，并得到深受其害的我国人民的衷心拥护。全世界一切爱好和平的人民，也都热烈欢迎苏联政府的照会，因为，严惩日本的细菌战犯，不仅是对于正在美帝国主义扶助下复活的日本侵略势力的沉重打击，而且是对新的世界大战挑拨者的沉重打击。
    去年十二月在伯力举行的对日本细菌战犯山田乙三等人的审讯，暴露了裕仁、石井、北野、若松以及笠原是日本帝国主义进行细菌战争的凶首。伯力审讯同时暴露：日本帝国主义者不仅曾经准备对苏联、中国和蒙古人民共和国进行细菌战争，而且还曾准备对美国和英国进行细菌战争。这样，人们就很容易了解：将裕仁等对人类犯了滔天罪行的战犯迅速提交国际特别军事法庭审判，这不仅符合苏联、中国和蒙古人民的共同利益，而且完全符合美国和英国人民以及全世界人民的利益。可是，美国政府却采取了完全相反的态度。美国国务院的新闻发布官麦克德谨于二月三日在记者招待会上发表了国务院的声明，宣称美国将拒绝苏联的照会。美国政府为裕仁等细菌战犯辩护，其借口一个是说远东委员会一九四六年四月三日会议曾达到“谅解”，免除把裕仁当作战犯来审判；另一个是说根据远东委员会一九四九年四月的决议，战犯审判早已结束。中国法学专家、前远东国际军事法庭法官梅汝璈于驳斥这一谎言时指出：这两个借口，都是歪曲事实，强词夺理的。事实上远东委员会的这两个文件的内容并非如此，一九四六年四月三日远东委员会的“谅解”只是暂时不把裕仁列为与东条、土肥原等第一批首级战犯二十八人同时起诉。这绝对不是说永不付审。至于远东委员会去年四月的决议，那只是希望各会员国对日本战犯的审判尽可能于去年九月底结束。这只是一项建议，并非表示去年九月以后不能继续对日本战犯举行审判。这种包庇日本战犯的态度，暴露了美帝国主义的真面目。
    曼谷会议的阴谋
    美国帝国主义准备已久的“远东外交人员会议”，即将于二月十三日在曼谷举行，美国驻远东及东南亚十三个国家的“外交代表”，已纷纷前往参加会议。围绕着这一会议，美国帝国主义分子耶塞普、白德华、麦克阿瑟和布莱德雷等人，最近曾在东京、马尼拉等地进行了紧张的活动，并举行了一系列秘密的会议。
    根据美国国务卿艾奇逊一月十二日关于亚洲政策的演说及耶塞普等人最近的言论与行动看来，曼谷会议的目的是很明显的。在东方各国民族解放运动空前高涨，在中国革命已取得伟大胜利，在民族解放战争正在越南、南朝鲜、菲律宾、印尼、马来亚、缅甸等国胜利发展的情势下，忘想独霸东南亚的美帝国主义，正力图强化它从阿拉斯加至菲律宾的一道侵略线，并建立从印尼至印度的另一道侵略线，然后，又以“太平洋联盟”之类的组织形式，把这两道侵略线联结起来，而以日本为其中的“主要堡垒”。曼谷会议就是讨论如何实行这一狂妄计划的会议。参加曼谷会议的美国外交阴谋家与战争贩子们，必然会策划各种阴谋诡计，来更积极地扶植美国在东方国家中的代理人，诸如蒋介石、李承晚、銮披汶、哈达、保大之流，阻挠各国的民族解放运动。在这里，反对新中国的具体措施，阻止中国人民解放军最后肃清国民党残匪的措施，显然将在曼谷会议中占居首要的地位。麦克阿瑟在与布莱德雷会谈中，曾公然主张“采取具体措施”，援助具有“战略价值”的台湾。菲律宾国防部长康利容已于九日应麦克阿瑟之召，飞赴日本接受援助台匪的任务。这些事实说明：美国利用菲律宾为授匪军火转运线，利用日本“志愿军”帮助国民党残匪屠杀中国人民的措施，将会更加加紧进行。同时，由于越南最近形势的发展，美国公开参加干涉越南民族解放战争的具体计划，亦将是曼谷会议的重要议程。耶塞普六日在新加坡谈话中，再次表示美国“深切关心”越南的情势，并声称“美国将以一切援助，甚至军事援助，给予被攻击的国家”。耶塞普的这一谈话，暴露了美国利用保大及逃至越南的国民党匪徒，来在越南建立反对中越两国人民的军事基地的企图。
    曼谷会议的阴谋，将是狠毒的。它应当引起东方各国人民应有的警惕，但是，曼谷会议的阴谋，如同美国过去在中国的阴谋一样，是必然要归于失败的。东方十万万人口中，已有一半以上挣脱了帝国主义的枷锁。这个伟大的力量，加上东方各殖民地国家中日益强大的民族解放运动，必然会把美帝国主义在远东的任何新侵略计划，打得粉碎。
    越南情势
    最近时期中的越南情势，是全世界注意的焦点之一。
    苏联、中国及各人民民主国家，已相继宣布决定与越南民主共和国建立外交关系。越南人民及全世界进步人士，欢庆这个年青的共和国成为和平与民主阵营里的一员。越南民主共和国国际地位的提高，是越南人民英勇斗争应得的结果。三年多以来，越南人民在越南民主共和国政府的领导下，胜利地进行了反对法国帝国主义的斗争。越南共和国现已控制全部越南领土的百分之九十以上。在全部二千余万的人口中，法国占领区的人口已不超过两百万。越南共和国已在全国成立了作为政权机关的人民委员会，已经实行减租百分之二十五，已经实施强制的国民教育，在消灭文盲方面作了很多的工作。
    帝国主义阵营鉴于苏联、中国与越南共和国建立外交关系，以及越南共和国力量的日益壮大，正仓皇把傀儡保大扶持起来。法国参院已于本月一日匆匆批准保大与阿里奥尔在一九四九年三月八日签订的“法越协定”，美国和英国也在七日同时宣布承认保大傀儡政权。美国帝国主义并企图以军事援助保大政权的方式，公开干涉越南人民争取民族独立的解放战争。但是，越南人民正充满着胜利的信心和决心，全力继续进行斗争，以击破国际反动派的阴谋，并争取国家的完全解放。而美英法帝国主义之扶持像保大这样的“夜总会皇帝”来作傀儡，正说明帝国主义统治基础的薄弱。
