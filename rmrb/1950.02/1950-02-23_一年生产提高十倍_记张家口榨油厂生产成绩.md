　　Production Increased Tenfold in One Year
　　——A Record of the Production Achievements of the Zhangjiakou Oil Pressing Factory
    By our special correspondent Li Yi
    Since Zhangjiakou was liberated again on December 24th of the year before last, the workers have been engaged in restoring and developing production with unparalleled joy and enthusiasm. In their minds, the time after December 24th, 1948, is linked to the happy life during the first liberation period from August 23rd, 1945, to October 11th, 1946. After the Kuomintang bandit gang launched the anti-people civil war, the workers of Zhangjiakou were ruled and enslaved by the bandits for more than two years. From the bandits' wanton trampling and plunder, the workers of Zhangjiakou drew endless hatred and the strength to forge ahead.
    In the Zhangjiakou Oil Pressing Factory, this situation is most evident.
    The Zhangjiakou Oil Pressing Factory has a total of 58 employees and operates three horizontal presses. In January of last year, the oil production was 10,030 jin (the highest monthly output during the Kuomintang rule did not exceed this number), and by December it had increased to 112,000 jin. The total oil production for the whole year last year was 886,000 jin. The output of one year would have taken eight years to complete during the rule of the Kuomintang bandit gang. The increase in output powerfully demonstrates the improvement in the political understanding of all employees.
    After regaining liberation, the employees first eliminated the guild factions that the Kuomintang bandit gang used to rule the workers and provoke disunity. All employees consciously strengthened their unity politically and established their own organization—the Trade Union—in order to restore and develop their factory and to support the complete victory of the national revolutionary war.
    Due to the united efforts of the leadership and the workers, and their joint study of operations, the factory gradually improved the methods of screening, roasting, and refining oil. Last summer, engineer Yan Shuqing and worker Chen Shaowen designed and installed an automatic material sorting machine. This increased the purity of the raw materials from 92 percent to 98 percent, exceeding the raw material purity standard of 97 percent stipulated by the Tianjin Commodity Inspection Bureau. In terms of manpower use, previously, manual screening of materials required seven workers for every 100 bags (90 kilograms per bag), but now only five workers are needed. The installation of the automatic screening machine laid a good foundation for the overall increase in production in the factory.
    They made extremely successful improvements in the roasting of materials. In the past, whether pressing pure linseed oil for industrial use or for general household use, the raw materials were first roasted in a wok and then crushed. Since August of last year, the production method has been improved so that the raw materials are directly crushed in a pulverizer without going through a wok, saving a lot of manpower and coal. Oil pressed using this method has a clear liquid color and is extremely suitable for use in quick-drying paints.
    Due to the improvement of the material selection method, the quality of the oil materials has been improved, and the corrosive acid content in the oil is only 0.96 percent. As such, the previously troublesome oil refining process has become unnecessary. Now, the oil extracted from the press only has a 4 percent loss during filtration, while in the past, when using the caustic soda refining method, the loss rate was usually above 7 percent. That is to say, due to the improvements in production methods, the loss of 30 per mille has been avoided just in terms of oil output. Secondly, there are also great savings in manpower and materials. According to factory statistics, with a daily oil production of 4,000 jin, 120 jin of caustic soda, 27,000 jin of coal, and more than 90 man-days can be saved each month.
    The increase in the speed of the oil press is one of the important reasons for the tenfold increase in the factory's products. The factory's repair shop workers, following the guidance of the engineering department, increased the speed of the oil press's main shaft from six revolutions per second to eight revolutions per second, increasing the original productivity of the three horizontal presses by 35 percent, and reducing the electricity consumption per jin of oil from 0.07 degrees to 0.06 degrees.
    The achievement of these results is inseparable from the rationalization proposal campaign carried out by the factory.
    Zhao Yushan, a technician in the oil pressing department, made many practical and effective suggestions in the increased production campaign. In April of last year, under his initiative, the method of reducing steam injection and increasing evaporation in the oil press was adopted to increase the temperature of the oil material. As a result, the capacity of the material increased and the pressure increased in the same space in the pressing cylinder. This saved one-sixth more raw material per jin of crude oil compared to January. In the same month, he also suggested changing the noon parking system to a system where workers take turns eating in the workshop without stopping the machine. Zhao Yushan's suggestion was extremely reasonable. In the past, because of the need to stop the machine for one hour for lunch, the feeding of the material had to be stopped half an hour before the stop. When the machine was restarted after an hour of rest, it took about half an hour to produce oil again because the temperature inside the machine had dropped during the stop. In this way, the loss suffered due to stopping the machine for lunch was a full two working hours. In addition, at Zhao Yushan's suggestion, in order to improve the situation of reduced oil production due to the oil press being too cold on the second day of the holidays (usually each horizontal press produces about 100 jin less oil when running on the second day after the holidays), the factory is planning to attach several heating pipes around the outside of each press. One press has already been laid out. According to factory statistics, Zhao Yushan's latter two suggestions resulted in a total increase in oil production of more than 7,400 jin from August to December of last year.
    Chen Shaowen in the repair shop is an outstanding technician. Last year, he saw that the blades inside the press were wearing out too much and were difficult to buy, so he suggested to the factory and organized the workers in the repair shop to use electric welding to build up the worn-out wing tips, reviving fourteen discarded blades. According to the current market price of blades, this saved a total of about 1,570 jin of millet.
    The above are just some of the more typical examples. The employees of the Zhangjiakou Oil Pressing Factory have focused on improving production since regaining liberation. The actual effects produced are: first, according to the factory's announcement, a total of more than 19,500 jin of millet was saved throughout the year; second, the product increased from 10,030 jin in January of last year to 110,000 jin in December. The annual oil production was 886,000 jin. This is a concise chart of the wealth they have increased for the people's motherland and for the final victory of the revolutionary war.

　　一年生产提高十倍
　　——记张家口榨油厂生产成绩
    本报特派记者  李翼
    张家口于前年十二月二十四日重获解放后，工人们以无比的喜悦与热情从事于恢复与发展生产。在他们的心目中，一九四八年十二月二十四日以后的时光，是与一九四五年八月二十三日至一九四六年十月十一日第一次解放期间的幸福生活连结在一起的。国民党匪帮掀起反人民的内战后，张家口的工人又被匪徒们统治、奴役了两年多，张家口的工人从匪徒们恣意的蹂躏与掠夺中，汲取了无限仇恨与奋发的力量。
    在张家口榨油厂，这种情景看得最明显。
    张家口榨油厂共有五十八名职工，开动三部横榨。去年一月份产油一万零三十斤（国民党统治时期每月最高产量亦不超过此数），十二月份已提高到十一万二千斤。去年全年产油总数为八十八万六千斤。一年的产量，在国民党匪帮统治期间，要八年才能完成，产量的增加有力地表明全体职工在政治认识上的提高。
    重获解放后，职工们首先消除了国民党匪帮为了统治工人，挑拨职工团结的行会派别。全体职工为着恢复与发展自己的工厂，为着支援全国革命战争的彻底胜利，在政治上自觉的加强了团结，建立了自己的组织—职工会。
    由于领导方面与工友们团结努力，共同钻研业务，该厂逐步改进了筛料、炒料、清油的方法。去年夏天，工务员燕树清与工友陈绍文等设计、装置了自动选料机。使原料的纯度由百分之九十二增至百分之九十八，超出了天津商品检验局所规定的百分之九十七的原料纯度标准。在人力使用上，以前人工筛料，每一百包（每包九十公斤）需七个工，现在仅仅需要五个工。自动筛料机的装置，为全厂提高生产打下了良好的基础。
    在炒料方法上，他们做了极为成功的改进。过去，无论榨制工业用或一般家庭用的纯葫麻油时，都是先将原料用炒锅炒焙，再行粉碎。去年八月份起，改进生产方法，原料不经炒锅，直接入粉碎机粉碎，节省了大量的人力和煤炭。用这一方法压制之油，液色清澄，极适合于甘性油漆之用。
    由于选料方法之改进，油料质量提高，油内所含腐性酸剂仅有百分之零点九六。如此，以前认为较麻烦的清油过程，已成为不必要了。现在由压榨机榨出之油，仅在过滤时有百分之四的损失，而在以前用加火碱清油法时，损失率通常在百分之七以上。这就是说，由于生产方法上的改进，单就油的产量来说，已免除了千分之三十的损失。其次在人力物力的节省上亦大，据厂方统计，以日产油四千斤计，每月可节省火碱一百二十斤，煤二万七千斤，以及九十多个人工。
    榨油机速率的增进，是该厂产品提高十倍的重要原因之一。厂内修理部工友，依照着工务方面的指导，将榨油机天轴转数由每秒钟六次改增至八次，使三部横榨机提高了原生产率的百分之三十五，使每斤油的用电量由点零七度降为点零六度。
    这些成绩的获得，是与该厂所开展的合理化建议运动分不开的。
    榨油部技术工人赵玉山，在增产运动中，他做了许多实际可行而效果良好的建议。去年四月间，在他的倡议下，在榨油机内采取少喷汽，加大蒸度，使油料温度加高的方法。结果在榨缸里的同一空间，料的容量增多，压力增大。使一斤原油所用原料，较一月份节省六分之一强。同一个月内，他又建议改变中午停车制度为在车间轮流吃饭不停车的制度。赵玉山的建议是异常合理的。在以前，因中午吃饭需停车一小时。在未停车前半小时，即须停止送料。休息一小时之后再开车时，因停车时车内温度降低，又约有半小时始能出油。这样，因中午停车吃饭遭受的损失是整整两个工时。此外，在赵玉山的建议下，为了改善因例假次日榨油机过冷产油量减少的情况（通常每部横榨机在例假后之第二日行车时要少出油一百斤左右），该厂正计划于每部榨机外围，紧附几盘暖气管。并已有一部敷设完毕。赵玉山的后两项建议，据厂方统计，自去年八月至十二月，总共多产油达七千四百余斤。
    修理部陈绍文，是一个出色的技术工人。去年他看到压榨机内榨刀耗损太大，且购买不易，便向厂方建议并组织了修理部的工友，用电焊的办法，将被磨损了的镟翅堆起，使十四个废榨刀复活，按目前榨刀市价，共约节省小米一千五百七十斤。
    以上仅仅是一些较典型的例子。张家口榨油厂的职工们，在重获解放后，专心致力于生产的改进，其所产生的实际效果是：第一，据厂方公布，全年共节约小米达一万九千五百余斤；第二，产品由去年一月份之一万零三十斤，增在十二月份之十一万斤。全年产油八十八万六千斤。这就是他们为人民的祖国，为着革命战争的最后胜利，而增殖财富的简明图表。
