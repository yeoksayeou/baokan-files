Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, January 31st: TASS Moscow, January 31st: Introduction to the Democratic Republic of Vietnam.

　　The Republic of Vietnam (Country of the South) includes the territories of the former French protectorates of Tonkin, Annam, and the colony of Cochinchina. The territory of the Republic is 350,000 square kilometers. The population is over 20 million, of which 2 million are in French-occupied areas. As of January 1, 1950, the Republic controlled 90 percent of the entire territory of Annam.

　　On August 8, 1945, an uprising against the Japanese aggressors and the pro-Japanese puppet regime existing on the territory of Indochina broke out in Tonkin Province, resulting in the establishment of the Republic of Vietnam. As a result of this uprising, on August 25, 1945, a provisional People's Government was established, headed by Ho Chi Minh, the leader of the resistance movement and a communist.

　　The Vietnamese government declared the independence of the Republic of Vietnam on September 2, 1945.

　　In September 1945, British Indian and French troops landed on the territory of the Republic and, under the pretext of disarming the remaining Japanese troops, launched an offensive against the Republic. The Vietnamese people responded with a heroic struggle of resistance.

　　On March 6, 1946, the French government was forced to sign a preliminary agreement with Ho Chi Minh's Republic in Hanoi, in which the French government recognized the Republic of Vietnam as a "free state with its own government, its own army, and finances, and as a component of the French Federation."

　　However, this agreement later proved to be a conspiracy by French imperialism to buy time to send more troops to the territory of the Republic. In December 1946, the French command launched a large-scale military offensive against Vietnam. The war has continued to this day.

　　French troops occupied Vietnam's industrial centers and major cities and ports, especially Saigon, Cholon (in Cochinchina), Tra Vinh, Da Nang, Hue (in Annam), and Haiphong (in Tonkin). However, the population of these places is only two million.

　　The Ho Chi Minh government implemented a number of democratic reforms in the Republic, adopted a democratic constitution, established people's committees throughout the country as organs of power, reduced land rent by 25 percent, adopted compulsory national education and achieved significant victories in eliminating illiteracy among the masses, implemented labor laws guaranteeing working people a 40-hour work week, and implemented paid holidays and social insurance. Military industries have been nationalized. Although the land of the Bao Dai royal family and those landlords attached to the French has been nationalized, the landlords' estates have not yet been distributed.

　　The French imperialists' attempt to crush the Democratic Republic of Vietnam by military action has failed, which has forced the French government to resort to establishing a Vietnamese puppet government headed by former Vietnamese Emperor Bao Dai in the French-occupied areas. On March 8, 1949, the French government and Bao Dai concluded an agreement on joining the puppet Vietnam to the French Federation and on granting the Vietnamese government certain possibilities of establishing diplomatic relations with other countries under French control. The ratification of this agreement is currently under discussion in the French National Assembly.

　　The United States and Britain intend to recognize the Bao Dai puppet government.

　　According to reliable sources, the Bao Dai puppet "government" is purely a bluff, because it cannot represent anyone except a small group of reactionaries.

　　介绍越南民主共和国
    【新华社北京三十一日电】塔斯社莫斯科三十一日讯：介绍越南民主共和国。
    越南共和国（南方之国）包括前法国保护国东京、安南和殖民地交趾支那的领土。共和国领土为三十五万平方公里。人口二千余万，其中二百万在法国占领区。截至一九五○年一月一日止，该共和国控制了全部安南领土的百分之九十。
    一九四五年八月八日，在东京省爆发了反对日本侵略者和当时存在于印度支那领土上的亲日傀儡政权的起义，结果，成立了越南共和国。这次起义的结果，于一九四五年八月二十五日成立了以抵抗运动的领袖、共产党人胡志明为首的临时人民政府。
    越南政府于一九四五年九月二日宣布了越南共和国的独立。
    一九四五年九月，英印与法国军队在共和国领土登陆，在解除残余日军武装的借口之下，发动了对共和国的进攻。越南人民报以英雄的抵抗斗争。
    一九四六年三月六日，法国政府被迫与胡志明的共和国在河内签订初步协定，法国政府承认了越南共和国为“有它自己的政府、自己的军队和财政并为法兰西联邦组成部分的自由国家”。
    然而，这个协定后来证明了原是法国帝国主义为了争取时间增派军队到该共和国领土去的阴谋。一九四六年十二月，法国统帅部对越南发动大规模的军事攻势。战争一直继续到今天。
    法军占领了越南的工业中心和主要城市与港口。特别是西贡、堤岸（在交趾支那）、茶助、土伦、顺化（在安南）和海防（在东京），然而，这些地方的人口不过二百万。
    胡志明政府在共和国实行了若干民主改革，通过了民主的宪法，在全国建立了作为政权机关的人民委员会，地租减低了百分之二十五，采取了强制的国民教育并在消除人民大众中的文盲方面获得了重大的胜利，实行了保证劳动人民四十小时工作周的劳动法，实行了假日给酬和社会保险。军事工业已经国有化。虽然保大皇族及那些依附法国的地主的土地已经国有化，然而地主的田产现在仍未分配。
    法国帝国主义者以军事行动粉碎越南民主共和国的企图失败了，这迫使法国政府诉之于在法军占领区建立以前越南皇帝保大为首的越南傀儡政府。一九四九年三月八日，法国政府与保大缔结了关于把傀儡越南加入法兰西联邦及关于给予越南政府以在法国控制下与其他国家建立外交关系的某些可能性的协定。这一协定的批准，现正在法国国民议会讨论中。
    美国和英国有意承认保大傀儡政府。
    根据可靠材料，保大傀儡“政府”纯粹是虚张声势的，因为它除了一小撮反动派而外什么人也不能代表。
