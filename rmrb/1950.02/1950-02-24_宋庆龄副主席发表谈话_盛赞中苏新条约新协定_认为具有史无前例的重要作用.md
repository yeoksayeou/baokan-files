Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, February 23rd:  Vice Chairman Soong Ching Ling of the Central People's Government, who is recuperating in Shanghai, issued a statement on the signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance and other agreements, as follows: The recent signing of the new Sino-Soviet treaty and new agreements is of unprecedented importance.  Because in the past, the reactionary government signed unequal treaties with imperialist countries. Now, the Soviet Union, with its great spirit of friendly cooperation, has signed equal and mutually beneficial treaties with us, making one-third of the world's population closely united, consolidating the anti-aggression peace camp.  In particular, the extremely appropriate handling of issues such as the Chinese Changchun Railway and Lushun Dalian demonstrates the great spirit of internationalism. As for economic loans, they provide enormous assistance to the construction of our new China. Therefore, the role of this new treaty and new agreements can not only shatter the imperialists' plots of discord, but also is a powerful guarantee of lasting peace.

　　宋庆龄副主席发表谈话
    盛赞中苏新条约新协定
    认为具有史无前例的重要作用
    【新华社上海二十三日电】在沪休养的中央人民政府宋庆龄副主席，就中苏友好同盟互助条约及其他各项协定之签订，发表谈话如下：最近中苏新条约和新协定的签订，是具有史无前例的重要作用。因为过去反动政府与帝国主义国家所订的都是些不平等条约。现在苏联以伟大的友好合作精神，与我们订立平等、互利的条约，使全世界三分之一的人口紧密地团结起来，巩固了反侵略的和平阵营。尤其是对于中长铁路与旅顺大连诸问题，作了极其适合的处理，表现了国际主义的伟大精神。至于经济方面的贷款，则更给我们新中国的建设莫大的助力。故这次新条约与新协定的作用，不仅可以粉碎帝国主义者之挑拨阴谋，而且是持久和平的有力保证。
