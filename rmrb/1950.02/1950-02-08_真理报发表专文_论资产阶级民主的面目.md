    Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 26th (TASS): Kelioluo夫 today published an article in *Pravda* entitled "The True Face of Bourgeois Democracy." Kelioluo夫 said that Lenin and Stalin always emphasized that bourgeois democracy is democracy for a very small number of people, democracy for the wealthy. Capitalist democracy is a veil to conceal the dictatorship and arbitrary behavior of a handful of bourgeois tycoons. The task of bourgeois "democracy" is to obscure the oppressed and ravaged situation of millions of working men and women. Therefore, behind the "democratic" government in the United States, there stands a small group of insatiable, cannibalistic monopolists who account for less than one percent of the total population. They hold nearly sixty percent of the national wealth of the United States. The real rulers of the United States are the largest monopoly companies, first and foremost the National Association of Manufacturers. We know that the domestic and foreign policies currently pursued by the Truman administration were formulated at the conference of American manufacturers and bankers held in Absecon under the auspices of the National Association of Manufacturers in 1945.

	It was also the National Association of Manufacturers that initiated the Taft-Hartley Act, which appropriately earned the name "Slave Law." In the United States, they say that America is really ruled by Wall Street and not by the White House. This is not an unfounded statement.

	Kelioluo夫 pointed out that the hypocritical and decadent essence of bourgeois democracy is particularly vividly manifested in the electoral systems of bourgeois countries. Under capitalism, the bourgeoisie uses elections as a weapon to maintain its rule.

	This can be seen most clearly in the United States. The American bourgeoisie uses all kinds of restrictions to prevent millions of working people from participating in elections. When election campaigns are underway, bourgeois parties widely use tricks, fraud, and outright violence against voters.

	Bourgeois democracy is decaying and declining, especially in recent years. The reactionary ruling groups are fearfully watching how the strength of capitalism is declining, while the strength of socialism and democracy is constantly increasing. The imperialist reactionaries, attempting to save the dying capitalist system, are using the most tyrannical means of violence on an ever-increasing scale. Under the hypocritical rhetoric of "defending democracy," the American ruling groups are stifling the slightest expression of free thought and trying to suppress the growing domestic resistance to the policy of fascism and preparation for a new war. Today's rulers of the United States shamelessly pretend to be defenders of democracy, while this America is increasingly becoming a huge police prison.

	In the United States, tens of millions of ordinary people are currently being deprived of basic civil rights. In the United States, no ordinary person dares to be sure that tomorrow he will not be investigated for his loyalty according to the president's cruel orders, or fall into the clutches of the House Un-American Activities Committee. They can be seized at any time by Edgar Hoover's secret police or the Ku Klux Klan's fascist thugs.

	The fascization of American domestic life is also manifested in racial discrimination, and it is enough to recall this point: only one out of every hundred adult black people can go to the polls to vote. American bourgeois democracy is the astonishing exploitation of black people, the wanton killing of black people, and rampant lynching. In 1948, 530 people were lynched in the United States. American reactionaries are transplanting similar fascist methods to the various countries they enslave. With the instigation and assistance of American "democrats," fascist gangs directly abuse the working people of Greece, Iran, and Spain. The recent heinous crimes of the Italian reactionaries in Modena are only one of the bloodstained fruits of the "American democracy" cultivated by Wall Street in the Marshallized countries. Under the lying rhetoric of "freedom" and "independence" of all nations, the American and British imperialist plunderers have established a system of prison labor with shackles for the people of the Eastern countries they enslave. Under the captivating nonsense of the "British Commonwealth," the Labor Party servants of the City of London and Wall Street have further intensified the oppression of billions of working people in colonies and dependent countries.

	The policies pursued by the British Labor government vividly demonstrate that so-called "socialist" governments under the conditions of bourgeois parliamentary politics are merely tools for the bourgeoisie to deal with the oppressed and exploited masses. Today, right-wing socialists are the main instigators of war, loyal servants of American imperialism, and dividers of the labor movement. They use the rhetoric of false socialism and cosmopolitanism to cover up the path of preparing for a new war that American and British aggressors are taking, and attempt to suppress the will of the people of all nations to fight for their freedom and independence.

	Bourgeois democracy, in the hands of the warmongers, has become the most convenient cloak to conceal their bloody conspiracies. Today, under the smoke screen of American and British "democracy," plans even larger than those planned by Hitler, Mussolini, and Tojo for seizing world hegemony are maturing. Under the cover of such words as "freedom of speech" and "freedom of the press," American and British war-mongers are carrying out fascist propaganda of hatred for humanity, directly calling for the extermination of the people of all nations in the world.

	Kelioluo夫 finally pointed out that the people of all nations are increasingly convinced from their own personal experience that capitalist democracy is a tool for deceiving and oppressing the working masses. The people of all nations are linking their hope of liberating themselves from imperialist enslavement with the great socialist democracy that leads humanity to the only correct path to true freedom and democracy. The prosperity and growth of socialist democracy in the Soviet Union encourages the working men and women of capitalist countries to fight for peace, democracy, and socialism.

　　真理报发表专文
    论资产阶级民主的面目
    柯里奥诺夫
    【新华社讯】塔斯社莫斯科二十六日电：柯里奥诺夫今日在真理报上撰文，题为《资产阶级民主的面目》。柯里奥诺夫说，列宁与斯大林总是强调，资产阶级民主是极少数人的民主，是富豪的民主。资本主义的民主，是掩蔽一小撮资产阶级巨子的大权独揽与专横行为的帷幕。资产阶级“民主”的任务，是把千百万劳动男女的横遭压迫与饱受蹂躏的处境蒙蔽起来。因此，如在美国“民主”政府的背后，就站着一小撮贪得无厌的食人野兽似的垄断资本家，他们还占不到人口总数的百分之一。美国全国财富几乎有百分之六十集中在他们的手里。美国的真正统治者是最大的垄断公司，首先是全国制造商协会。我们知道，杜鲁门政府目前执行的国内政策与外交政策，是一九四五年在全国制造商协会主持下在艾布西孔召开的美国制造商与银行家大会上所制定的。
    倡议塔夫脱——哈特莱法案的也是全国制造商协会，这个法律恰合身份地博得了一个《奴隶法》的名称。在美国，他们说，美国实在是受华尔街统治而不是受白宫统治的。这话并不是凭空乱说的。
    柯里奥诺夫指出，资产阶级民主的虚伪的与腐朽的实质，在资产阶级国家的选举制度中特别生动地表现出来。在资本主义的条件下，资产阶级利用选举作为保持其统治的武器。
    在美国，可以最明白地看到这一点。美国资产阶级利用一切限制的办法阻挠着千百万劳动人民参加选举。当竞选运动进行时，资产阶级政党广泛地使用诡计、诈伪以及对选民公然采取暴力行动。
    资产阶级的民主已在腐朽衰亡，特别是近数年以来。反动的统治集团心怀恐惧地看到资本主义的力量是在如何地衰落下去，而社会主义与民主的力量则在不断地加强。帝国主义反动派，企图拯救即将死亡的资本主义制度，规模越来越大地使用最强横的暴力手段。在关于“维护民主”的伪善辞句掩饰下，美国统治集团窒息着自由思想的最轻微的表现，并力图压服国内对于法西斯化与准备新战争这一政策的日益增长的抵抗。今日美国的统治者，厚颜无耻地装作民主的维护者，而这个美国却越来越变成一个巨大的警察牢狱。
    在美国，目前有几千万普通人被剥夺掉基本公民权利。在美国，普通人中间谁也不敢断定明天他不致被人按照总统残酷的命令来调查他的忠诚，或陷入众院非美活动委员会的魔掌。他们在任何时候都可能被爱特加·胡佛的秘密警察或三Ｋ党的法西斯暴徒抓去。
    美国国内生活的法西斯化，也表现在种族歧视上，只要追述这一点就够了：在每一百名成年黑人中，只有一人可以到投票站去选举。美国资产阶级的民主，就是对黑人的惊人剥削，对黑人的大肆杀戮，和任处私刑。美国在一九四八年，有五百三十人受到私刑。美国反动分子把类似的法西斯手段移植到他们所奴役的各个国家去。法西斯伙帮们在美国“民主分子”的策动和帮助下，直截了当地虐待希腊、伊朗和西班牙的劳动人民。意大利反动派最近在摩登纳的骇人罪行，只不过是华尔街在马歇尔化各国培植的“美国民主”的血迹斑斑的果实之一罢了。美英帝国主义劫掠者在什么“自由”和各民族“独立”的撒谎辞句的掩盖下，为他们奴役下的东方诸国的人民建立了囚犯带铐作工的制度。伦敦城和华尔街的工党奴仆们，在什么“大英联邦”的笼络人心的连篇废话的掩盖下，已更大程度地加紧了对于殖民地及附属国的亿万劳动人民的压迫。
    英国工党政府所奉行的政策，生动地证明了：在资产阶级议会政治之条件下的所谓“社会主义者”政府，只不过是资产阶级对付被压迫、被剥削群众的工具罢了，今天，右翼社会党人就是战争制造者的主要煽动者美国帝国主义的忠顺奴仆和劳工运动的分裂者。他们以假社会主义和世界主义的辞藻来掩盖美英侵略者所正在走着的准备新战争的道路，企图抑制各民族人民为他们的自由与独立而斗争的意志。
    资产阶级的民主，在战争挑拨者的手上就成为掩盖他们血腥阴谋的最便当不过的外衣。今天，在美英“民主”的烟幕下，比希特勒、墨索里尼、东条所筹划的还要庞大的夺取世界霸权的计划，正在筹划成熟中。美英战争贩子在什么“言论自由”、“出版自由”等等词句的掩盖下，正在进行着仇恨人类的法西斯宣传，直截了当地号召灭绝世界各民族的人民。
    柯里奥诺夫最后指出：各民族人民从他们自己的亲身经验中越来越深信，资本主义的民主就是愚弄和压迫劳苦群众的工具。各民族人民正在把他们从帝国主义的奴役下解放出来的希望，与那向人类光明通达真正自由与民主之唯一正确道路的伟大的社会主义民主联结起来，社会主义民主在苏联的繁荣滋长鼓舞着资本主义国家的劳动男女去为和平、民主与社会主义而斗争。
