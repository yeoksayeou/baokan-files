　　North China Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company
    Decides to Purchase Red Cotton to Help Cotton Farmers in Disaster Areas Overcome Difficulties
    [This Newspaper's Report] In order to help cotton farmers in disaster areas overcome difficulties and enable them to exchange red cotton for grain to survive the famine, the North China Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company has assigned purchase tasks to its branches in various regions. Note: Last year, the cotton in the North China region was planted late due to spring drought and little rain; in the autumn, repeated rain and early frost resulted in poor cotton quality. Red cotton (i.e., the most inferior cotton that is immature after frost) accounted for approximately 20% to 30% of the total yield, with a particularly high proportion in disaster areas. When red cotton is used as a textile raw material, it can only spin 3 to 5 count yarn. Therefore, the North China Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company did not purchase it during the cotton collection last year. Currently, there is a particularly large amount of red cotton on the market in various regions, and it cannot be sold. The Ministry of Trade of the Central People's Government, in order to take care of the people in disaster areas, has taken this measure to solve the problem of red cotton sales, which has won enthusiastic support from cotton farmers in various disaster areas.
    In addition: The Nanyuan Branch of the Beijing Branch of the company has transported a large quantity of yellow corn to facilitate cotton farmers in disaster areas to exchange cotton for grain. The exchange with cotton farmers has been underway since January 26th. Because the grain price is 20% lower than the general market price, the cotton farmers in the area are extremely satisfied.

　　华北花纱布公司
    照顾灾区棉农困难决定收购各地红花
    【本报讯】华北花纱布公司为照顾灾区棉农困难，使其能将红花换粮渡荒，现已向各地分支公司布置收购任务。按：去年华北地区棉花，因春旱少雨，播种较晚；至秋季复因多雨早霜，以致棉质不好。其中红花（即霜后不成熟的最次花）约占产量百分之二十到三十，灾区红花所占比例尤大。红花用作纺织原料时，仅能纺三支至五支纱。因而去年华北花纱布公司在进行收花时，未予收购。由于目前各地红花上市特多，均无法销售。中央人民政府贸易部为照顾灾民，这一措施使红花销售获得解决，博得灾区各地棉农热烈拥戴。
    又：该公司北京分公司所属南苑支公司，为便利灾区棉农以棉易粮，特由该公司运到大批黄玉米。自上月二十六日开始，已与棉农进行交换。因粮价低于一般市价十分之二，该地棉农极表满意。
