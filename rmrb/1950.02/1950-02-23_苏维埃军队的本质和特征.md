　　The Soviet army, created by the great leaders of the Bolshevik Party and the Soviet state, Lenin and Stalin, is inseparable from its people. Stalin gave the Soviet army a supreme definition, believing it to have the following three characteristics:
    "The first and basic characteristic of our Red Army is that it is an army of liberated workers and peasants, an army of the October Revolution, an army of the dictatorship of the proletariat."
    "The second characteristic of our Red Army is that it, our army, is an army of close unity of all nationalities in our country, an army that has liberated all the previously oppressed nationalities in our country, and an army that protects the freedom and independence of all nationalities in our country."
    "Finally, regarding the third characteristic of the Red Army. This third characteristic lies in the spirit of internationalism, in the internationalist sentiment that permeates our entire Red Army." (Stalin, "On the Three Characteristics of the Red Army")
    These characteristics of the Soviet army were fully demonstrated during the civil war and peaceful construction period, but the Great Patriotic War particularly highlighted these characteristics.
    During the civil war against the German imperialist bandits and the imperialist allied forces (1918-1920), the Soviet army first demonstrated its two characteristics: that it was an army of liberated workers and peasants and that it was an army of close unity of all nationalities in our country. The young army of the Soviet Republic had developed into an organized force. It ended foreign intervention, drove all the aggressors out of Soviet territory, liberated the oppressed nationalities, and preserved their independence and freedom, saving them from enslavement.
    From the very beginning, the Soviet army differed greatly from bourgeois armies in terms of organization. This was not only because it was an army of the dictatorship of the working class, an army based on the friendship of the Soviet people, but also because it was known for its internationalism, its spirit of respect and love for the working class of all countries, and its lofty ideals of peace among nations. This characteristic explains why foreign workers and all progressive humanity felt infinite sympathy for the Soviet Union.
    The war that broke out on June 21, 1941, was a severe test of all the strength of the Soviet people and their army. The Hitler bandits massively invaded the Soviet Union, attempting to restore the rule of landlords and capitalists and enslave all the Soviet people.
    The enemy used surprise attack tactics with a large number of troops to invade the Soviet Union. As our country was confronting a treacherous and overwhelmingly superior enemy, Stalin pointed out in his message to the people and the army that the task of the Soviet army was not only to eliminate the danger facing the Soviet Union, but also to provide assistance to the European people groaning under the shackles of German fascism.
    During the war that exposed the barbaric nationalism of the German fascist army, Stalin pointed out that the Soviet army "is an army that defends peace and friendship among all nations. It was created not for the purpose of conquering other countries, but for the purpose of defending the borders of the Soviet homeland."
    This unique characteristic of the Soviet army enhanced the moral and combat qualities of the Soviet soldiers and helped to win the victory over the enemy. The sons and daughters of the entire people of the Soviet state were inspired and united by a single patriotic belief. They fought heroically against the Hitler bandits. Soldiers with the glorious title of "Hero of the Soviet Union" represented the various nationalities of the Soviet Union. A total of 10,943 people were awarded this title, of whom 7,627 were Russians, 1,928 were Ukrainians, 224 were Belarusians, 157 were Tatars, 97 were Kazakhs, 81 were Georgians, 66 were Uzbeks, 88 were Armenians, 48 were Azerbaijanis, 16 were Turkmen, 15 were Tajiks, 8 were Karelians, and there were also representatives of other nationalities. These figures are a powerful testament to the courage shown in battle by the fraternal socialist nationalities of the Soviet state.
    Between 1941 and 1943, when the Soviet army, led by the great Stalin and supported by the Soviet people, fought the main force of the fascists without foreign aid, it seized the strategic initiative from the enemy. Leningrad, Moscow, Tikhvin, Rostov, and Stalingrad—these are all glorious and historically significant markers that the Soviet army erected on the path of war at that time.
    In 1944, according to Stalin's strategic plan, the Soviet army inflicted ten devastating blows on the enemy in the Soviet republics of Ukraine, Belarus, Karelia-Finland, Moldova, Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania, and drove out the German aggressors. The Soviet army won decisive victories in cooperation with the heroic guerrillas, who crushed the enemy behind enemy lines for the freedom of the motherland.
    In the course of the war, the Soviet army crossed the borders of its own country, defeated the German fascist bandits in Romania, drove them out of Bulgaria, and pursued and annihilated the Hitler bandits in the territories of Hungary, Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia, Poland, and Norway.
    The Polish and Czech armies, organized by the patriots of Poland and the Czech Republic, entered their own territories together with the Soviet army, thanks to the friendly assistance of the Soviet socialist regime. The Soviet army equipped the fraternal Slavic nations' forces with the latest tactical knowledge and the best Soviet weapons. At the same time, the Soviet army also educated them to hate the enemy and to respect their combat cooperation.
    As soon as the Soviet army set foot on every foreign land, they gave the people of these countries the possibility of free ideals. The revolutionary forces of the people revealed and politically defeated the bourgeois parties that compromised and cooperated with the Hitler bandits. Supported by the world-historical victory of the Soviet army, the people of Poland, Czechoslovakia, Bulgaria, Albania, Romania, and Hungary established free people's democratic states, abandoning capitalism and embarking on the road of socialist construction.
    In 1945, the Soviet army completely defeated the Hitler aggressors. The victory of the Soviet army liberated the Soviet Union from the danger of German fascist invasion from the west and saved European culture from destruction.
    The Soviet government, out of concern for peace and faithfulness to the responsibilities of its allies, declared war on Japan. In a very short period of time, the Soviet army defeated the main force of the Japanese army—the Kwantung Army—and forced Japan to surrender, thus ending World War II.
    The Soviet army, as an army of peace and friendship among all nations, and as an army of liberation, is characterized very vividly by the friendly attitude of the Soviet officers and soldiers towards the people they liberated. The Soviet army eliminated the vicious arsonists of Madanlek and Auschwitz. It liberated thousands of Poles, Frenchmen, and Belgians from bloody concentration camps and helped residents return to normal life. The Soviet army, after defeating the enemy and completing its mission, immediately withdrew from the territory of other countries.
    When the Soviet army withdrew from Bulgaria, Norway, Czechoslovakia, Poland, Northeast China, and North Korea, and from all those countries they had arrived in to defend their homeland and provide friendly assistance to the oppressed people, the residents expressed warm friendship and gratitude to them, which was a sincere expression of gratitude from the patriots of these countries.
    Recently, during the celebration of Stalin's 70th birthday, boundless, deep, sincere friendship and gratitude once again poured out from the people liberated by the Soviet army. The echo of this friendship and gratitude is like an oath from the people of these countries as they move forward on the road to socialism.
    "Our people," wrote Vilko Chervenkov, Secretary of the Central Committee of the Bulgarian Communist Party, "will never forget the help given by the Soviet Liberation Army... Our people will never forget that, thanks to the brilliant and resolute protection of the Soviet Union and Stalin, they preserved their national independence and their national sovereignty."
    Arpad Szakasits, Chairman of the Presidium of the Hungarian People's Republic, wrote on the occasion of the celebration of Stalin's 70th birthday: "On this day, the Hungarian people, liberated from the fascist shackles by the victorious Soviet army under your wise leadership, respectfully salute you—the leader and teacher of mankind who created the new world—with gratitude and love."
    Soviet soldiers are proud to serve under the glorious banner of the army established by Lenin, Stalin, and the Bolshevik Party. They receive the love and care of all the nationalities of the great Soviet Union. The nationalities of the Soviet Union regard their armed forces as an invincible fortress.
    While the imperialists are carrying out a frantic war propaganda, the Soviet army vigilantly defends the peace it has won and defends the construction undertakings of the Soviet people.

　　苏维埃军队的本质和特征
    苏联英雄Ｖ·茨威塔耶夫上将著
　　聂文杞  周颖如  合译
    为布尔什维克党和苏维埃国家的伟大领袖列宁、斯大林所创建的苏维埃军队，是和它的人民不可分的。斯大林给苏维埃军队下了一个至高无上的定义，他认为它具有下面三个特点：
    “我们红军之第一个和基本的特点，就在于它是已获得解放的工农之军队，它是十月革命之军队，它是无产阶级专政之军队。”
    “我们红军之第二个特点，就在于它，即我们的军队，是我国各民族亲密联合之军队，使我国以前各被压迫民族获得解放的军队，是保护我国各民族自由和独立的军队。”
    “最后，关于红军之第三个特点。这第三个特点就在于国际主义精神，就在于浸透我们整个红军的国际主义情感。”（斯大林著“论红军三个特点”）
    苏维埃军队所具有的这些特点，在内战与和平建设时期充分地表现了出来，但是伟大的卫国战争更特别显示了这些特点。
    在反抗德皇匪帮与反抗帝国主义联军的内战时期（一九一八——一九二○），苏维埃军队第一次表现了它是已获得解放的工农之军队与它是我国各民族亲密联合之军队这两个特点。苏维埃共和国的年青的军队已发展成为一个有组织的武力。它终止了外国的干涉，把所有的侵略者从苏维埃领土内赶走，它解放了被压迫民族，并且保存了他们的独立与自由，使它们免于奴役。
    从最初开始，苏维埃军队在组织方面就与资产阶级的军队迥然不同。这不只是因为它是工人阶级专政的军队，它是以苏联人民的友爱为基础的军队，而且他还以它的国际主义，它尊敬与热爱各国工人阶级的精神，以及它的民族之间崇高的和平理想而称著于世。这个特点说明了为什么外国工人与一切进步人类感觉到对于苏联都有无限的同情。
    一九四一年六月二十一日爆发的战争是对苏维埃人民及其军队的一切力量一个严厉的考验。希特勒匪帮大举侵犯苏联，他们企图恢复地主与资本家的政权，奴役全体苏联人民。
    敌人用意外突击的战术，以大量军队，侵犯苏联。当我国正与虎头蛇尾极占优势的敌人相对抗时，斯大林在他给人民与军队的文告中指出：苏维埃军队的任务不单是要消除苏联所面临的危险，并且对呻吟于德国法西斯主义者羁绊下的欧洲人民予以援助。
    在暴露那德国法西斯主义军队之野蛮的民族主义的战争时期，斯大林指出：苏维埃军队“是保卫各国人民间和平与友谊的军队。它创建的目的不是在于征服其他国家，而是在于保卫苏维埃国土的边疆。”
    苏维埃军队所独具的这个特点，增强了苏维埃士兵的道义的和战斗的品质，并帮助赢得对敌人的胜利。苏维埃国家全体人民的儿女是由唯一的爱国主义信念所鼓舞和结合的。他们英勇地与希特勒匪徒相斗争。具有“苏联英雄”光荣称号的士兵代表了苏联的各种民族。被授以此种称号的共有一万零九百四十三人，其中七千六百二十七人为俄罗斯人，一千九百二十八人为乌克兰人，二百二十四人为白俄罗斯人，一百五十七人为鞑靼人，九十七人为哈萨克人，八十一人为乔治亚人，六十六人为乌兹贝克人，八十八人为亚美尼亚人，四十八人为亚塞尔拜然人，十六人为土尔其门人，十五人为塔吉克人，八人为卡累利亚人，此外还有其他民族的代表。这些数字是苏维埃国家的友爱的社会主义的民族在战斗中所表现的勇敢的有力证明。
    一九四一至一九四三年间，在由伟大的斯大林所领导及苏维埃人民所支持的苏维埃军队毫无外援地对法西斯主力作战时，它从敌人手中争取了战略主动。列宁格勒、莫斯科、蒂赫文、罗斯托夫、斯大林格勒--这些都是苏军当时在战争的路途上所树立的光荣而富于历史性的标帜。
    一九四四年苏军依据斯大林战略计划，在乌克兰、白俄罗斯、卡累利亚·芬兰、摩尔达维亚、爱沙尼亚、拉脱维亚和立陶宛等苏维埃共和国中，给敌人以十次毁灭性的打击，并驱逐了德国侵略者。苏维埃军队在与英勇的游击队合作之下赢得了决定性的胜利。这些英勇的游击队为了祖国的自由，在敌后将敌人击溃。
    苏维埃军队在战争的过程中，越出了自己祖国的边界，他们在罗马尼亚击溃了德国法西斯强盗，将这群强盗从保加利亚赶走，在匈牙利、捷克、南斯拉夫、波兰和挪威的国土上追击和歼灭了希特勒匪帮。
    波兰和捷克的爱国者所组织的波兰军队与捷克军队，由于苏维埃社会主义政权的友谊帮助，和苏军共同进入他们自己的国土。苏维埃军队用最新战术的知识，与最优良的苏联武器来装备兄弟般的斯拉夫民族的武力。同时苏军还教育他们仇恨敌人，教育他们尊重他们的战斗合作。
    只要苏维埃军队一踏入这些外国的每一处国土，他们便使这些国家的人民获得了自由理想的可能。人民的革命力量揭示了并使与希特勒强盗们妥协合作的资产阶级政党遭受政治的失败。波兰、捷克、保加利亚、阿尔巴尼亚、罗马尼亚和匈牙利的人民在苏维埃军队的世界历史性的胜利的支持下，建立了自由的人民民主国家，他们脱离了资本主义而步入社会主义建设的道路。
    一九四五年苏维埃军队完全击溃了希特勒侵略者。苏维埃军队的胜利将苏联自德国法西斯西侵的危境中解放出来，并使欧洲文化免于毁灭。
    苏联政府，由于关切和平与忠实于同盟者的责任，乃对日本宣战。在极短时期内苏维埃军队击溃了日本的主力——关东军，促使日本投降，于是，结束了第二次世界大战。
    苏维埃军队，作为各族人民间和平与友好的军队，及作为解放的军队，它的特点非常生动地表现在苏维埃官兵对于被他们所解放的人民的友谊的态度上。苏维埃军队消灭了凶恶的纵火者马丹勒克与奥斯威西姆。它将成千的波兰人、法国人和比利时人从血腥的集中营中解放出来，并帮助居民回复正常生活。苏维埃军队，在击溃敌人和完成任务后，立即从他国领土内撤退。
    当苏维埃军队从保加利亚、挪威、捷克、波兰、中国东北和北朝鲜撤走时，从所有那些他们为了保卫祖国和对被压迫人民予以友谊的帮助而到达的国家撤走时，居民对他们表示了热烈的友谊与感激，这种友谊与感激正是这些国家的爱国者真诚感激的表现。
    最近庆祝斯大林七十寿辰时，无限深切的真诚的友谊与感激再度从被苏维埃军队所解放的人民中倾泻出来。这种友谊与感激的反响，有如这些国家的人民在走向社会主义的路途上前进的宣誓。
    “我们的人民”——保加利亚共产党中央委员会书记维尔柯·却文柯夫写道——“将永远不会忘记苏维埃解放军所给予的帮助……我们的人民将永远不会忘记：由于苏联和斯大林的光辉而坚决的保卫，他们才保存了他们的民族独立和他们的国家主权。”
    匈牙利人民共和国主席团主席阿尔巴·萨卡西克斯在庆贺斯大林七十寿辰时写道：“在这一天，你贤明领导下的胜利的苏维埃军队从法西斯的枷锁下所解放出来的匈牙利人民，谨怀着感激与热爱向你——创造新世界的人类的领袖与导师致敬。”
    苏维埃士兵们以在列宁、斯大林与布尔什维克党所建立的军队的光荣的旗帜下服务而骄傲。他们领受着伟大的苏联的各民族的爱护。苏联各民族把他们的武装力量视为不可战胜的堡垒。
    当帝国主义者正进行着疯狂的战争宣传时，苏维埃军队警觉地捍卫着既得的和平，捍卫着苏维埃人民的建设事业。
