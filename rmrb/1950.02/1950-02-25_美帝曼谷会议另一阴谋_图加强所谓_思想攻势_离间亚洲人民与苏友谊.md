　　Following the "U.S. Far East Diplomatic Personnel Conference" held in Bangkok, in addition to deciding to strengthen aggression against Southeast Asian countries in military, economic, and political aspects, the United States will pay special attention to strengthening the so-called "ideological offensive" to intensify deceptive propaganda against the people of Southeast Asian countries and sow discord between the people of various countries and the Soviet Union. According to a United Press report from Colombo on the 17th, public affairs officials from U.S. embassies and legations in Southeast Asia, who are responsible for propaganda work, are scheduled to meet in Singapore on the 22nd to discuss the decisions of the Bangkok conference and study "how to break down the misconceptions and misunderstandings of Americans in Asian countries."
    Another report from United Press on the 17th, quoting diplomatic sources in Washington, revealed: "The United States will intensify efforts to alienate the Soviet Union from the Chinese Communists and the Soviet Union from other Asian people who seem to sympathize with the Kremlin. This 'ideological struggle' will be an important move suggested by Jessup, Ambassador-at-Large, and his colleagues, who were sent by Acheson and Truman to inspect the diplomatic situation."

　　美帝曼谷会议另一阴谋
    图加强所谓“思想攻势”  离间亚洲人民与苏友谊
    【新华社北京二十二日电】美国在曼谷举行“美国远东外交人员会议”之后，除了决定在军事、经济、政治等方面加强对东南亚各国的侵略外，并将特别注意加强所谓“思想攻势”，以加紧对东南亚各国人民进行欺骗宣传和挑拨离间各国人民与苏联的友谊。据美联社科伦坡十七日电称，美国驻东南亚各大使馆和公使馆负责宣传工作的公共事务官员已定于二十二日在新加坡集会，讨论曼谷会议的决定，研究“如何打破亚洲各国对美国人的谬见与误解”。
    另据合众社十七日引华盛顿外交界人士透露：“美国将加紧努力离间苏联与中共以及苏联与似乎颇同情克里姆林宫的其他亚洲人民。这种‘思想斗争’将是艾奇逊与杜鲁门派去视察外交情势的无任所大使耶塞普及其同僚所建议的重要一着。”
