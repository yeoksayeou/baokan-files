(I) Try the Bacterial Warfare Criminals, Fight for Human Safety!

Today, Vice Foreign Minister Li Kenong, representing our government, replied to the Soviet government, fully agreeing with the Soviet government's February 1st note regarding the establishment of a special international military tribunal to try Japanese bacterial warfare criminals including Japanese Emperor Hirohito, Shiro Ishii, Masazo Kitano, Jiro Wakamatsu, Yukio Kasahara, and others.

Our government's position fully reflects our people's boundless indignation towards Japanese bacterial warfare criminals. Since the Soviet Union announced the results of the Primorsky Krai Military Tribunal's public trial of war criminals Yamada, Takahashi, Kajitsuka, and others, and the people of Heilongjiang, Hunan, Zhejiang and other regions of our country have confirmed it based on personal experience, the people of the whole country have been demanding severe punishment for Japanese bacterial warfare criminals. It is easy to understand why the Chinese people unanimously support the Soviet government's February 1st proposal. The Chinese people personally suffered the slaughter and poisoning by Japanese war criminals and cannot but demand revenge. The Chinese people cannot but demand the punishment of the Japanese bacterial war criminals who have committed heinous crimes. This is the sacred right of the Chinese people to uphold justice and safeguard security. The Chinese people can never accept the shameless sophistry that the trial of Japanese war criminals has ended, that the Japanese Emperor has been granted immunity, and therefore even if the crime of directing bacterial warfare is discovered, Hirohito and other criminals should not be tried. Just Japanese people, after seeing that their Emperor has committed such heinous crimes, will also not oppose a just trial of the Emperor.

The Chinese people want to see: what attitude will the countries concerned take towards the Japanese bacterial war criminals who slaughtered the Chinese people? The facts are extremely clear: whoever advocates trying and punishing these inhumane criminals is opposing the Japanese aggressors and opposing bacterial warfare; he is a friend of the Chinese people, a friend of human justice and security. Conversely, whoever makes excuses and opposes the trial and punishment of Japanese bacterial war criminals is shielding the Japanese aggressors and supporting bacterial warfare; he is not a friend of the Chinese people, he is an enemy of human justice and security.

We know that the US government is unwilling to punish Japanese bacterial war criminals. This is not only because the US government is protecting the Japanese aggressors, but also because it is planning bacterial warfare itself, just like planning atomic warfare. But the US government has always declared that it has not done so, and declared that it is the savior of human peace, the sweetest friend of the Chinese and Asian peoples, etc. Well, now is the time to reveal the truth. If the US government and other governments want to prove that they are indeed sympathetic to the Chinese people's demands for justice and security, they should, like our government, immediately agree to establish a special international military tribunal to try and punish Japanese Emperor Hirohito and other bacterial war criminals. If not, the US government will prove to the whole of China and the world its imperialist face, proving that it is the protector and accomplice of Japanese bacterial war criminals, the enemy of the Chinese people, and the enemy of the justice and security of all mankind.

(II) Shanghai compatriots, remember this blood feud!

The Kuomintang remnants bombed Shanghai twice last month on the 25th and this month on the 6th, causing serious losses to the lives and property of the Shanghai people. The people of the whole country feel great sympathy for the sacrifices of the Shanghai people, and hold great hatred for the Kuomintang remnants, especially their instigator, US imperialism. We must avenge this hatred this year!

The Shanghai and national compatriots will always remember: US imperialism is the primary culprit in this bombing. First, the planes and bombs for the bombing were all supplied by the United States. The United States has been supplying the Taiwan remnants with military supplies under the guise of "appropriations," in the name of commerce, or in the name of the Philippines, and this is what no Truman statement, Acheson statement, or Jessup statement can cover up. Second, the KMT air force personnel who flew the bombers and carried out the bombing included Americans and Japanese so-called "volunteers." Such facts could not have happened without the consent of the US government and MacArthur Headquarters. The remnant Kuomintang air force could not have carried out such bombings without Japanese and Americans flying the planes. Third, it is especially noteworthy that the bombing on February 6th accurately destroyed the American-owned Yangshupu Shanghai Electric Power Company. There is no doubt that the Taiwan air force, loyal to the United States, would only dare to do so after receiving orders from Washington.

US imperialists have recently been propagating their "friendship" with China every day, as well as the Soviet Union's "aggression" against China. But look at a simple fact: was it Soviet planes or American planes that bombed Shanghai this time, as well as countless bombings of the Chinese Liberated Areas in the past? As long as every Chinese remembers this point, he will naturally understand the whole truth, and understand what friends must be united with and what enemies must be opposed.

The bombing of Shanghai tells our national compatriots: China is still in a tense and fierce war in 1950. We must thoroughly eliminate the Kuomintang remnants, we must liberate Taiwan, the Zhoushan Islands, Hainan Island, and Tibet, and clear away the running dog forces of US imperialism and Japanese imperialism from the whole of China, so that the survival and construction of the Chinese people can be guaranteed.

We are a brave nation that has experienced more than ten years of war and achieved victory. In this final year of the war, the final destruction that the enemy has inflicted on us can only strengthen our will to fight and accelerate the pace of battle! Let us unite as one, help the Shanghai people, quickly restore the damage the enemy has inflicted on us, and use all means to quickly eliminate the enemy completely!

　　新华社社论
    （一）审判细菌战争罪犯，为人类安全而斗争！
    我国外交部李克农副部长今天代表我国政府答复苏联政府，完全同意苏联政府二月一日照会关于成立特别国际军事法庭以审讯日本细菌战争罪犯日本裕仁天皇、石井四郎、北野政藏、若松次郎、笠原行雄等人的建议。
    我国政府的这个立场，完全反映了我国人民对于日本细菌战争罪犯的无限义愤。自从苏联公布伯力滨海军区军事法庭公审山田、高桥、梶冢等战犯的结果，而我国黑龙江、湖南、浙江等地人民又根据亲身的经历加以证实以后，全国人民对于日本细菌战争罪犯纷纷要求严惩。中国人民一致拥护苏联政府二月一日的建议，这是容易理解的。中国人民亲自遭受了日本战争罪犯的屠杀毒害，不能不要求报复。中国人民不能不要求惩办罪恶滔天的日本细菌战犯，这是中国人民为了伸张正义和保障安全的神圣权利。中国人民决不能接受那种认为日本战犯审判已经结束、日本天皇已被豁免，因而即令发现主持细菌战争这样的罪行也不应当对裕仁天皇和其他罪犯举行审判的无耻诡辩。正义的日本人在看到他们的天皇曾经如此地犯了滔天罪行之后，自亦不能反对对于天皇的正义的审判。
    中国人民要看：对于屠杀了中国人民的日本细菌战争罪犯，有关各国究竟采取什么态度呢？事实明显极了：谁要是主张对这些灭绝人性的罪犯加以审讯治罪，他便是反对日本侵略者，反对细菌战争的人，他便是中国人民的朋友，便是人类正义和安全的朋友。反之，谁要是借词推诿，反对审讯惩办日本细菌战犯，他就是包庇日本侵略者，拥护细菌战争的人，他就不是中国人民的朋友，他就是仇视人类正义和安全的人。
    我们知道，美国政府是不愿意惩办日本细菌战犯的。这不但因为美国政府正在庇护日本侵略者，而且因为它自己也正在计划细菌战争，如同计划原子战争一样。但是美国政府从来都声明它并没有这样做，而且声明它是人类和平的救星，中国和亚洲各国人民的最甜蜜的朋友等等。好吧，现在是图穷匕见的时候了。美国政府和其他各国政府如果要证明自己确是中国人民正义和安全要求的同情者，它们就应当和我国政府一样，立即同意成立特别国际军事法庭，审讯并惩办日本裕仁天皇和其他细菌战犯。如果不然，美国政府就向全中国和全世界证明了自己的帝国主义面目，证明自己是日本细菌战犯的保护人和帮凶，是中国人民的仇敌，是全人类正义和安全的仇敌。
    （二）上海的同胞们，记着这血海深仇！
    国民党残匪在上月二十五日和本月六日两次狂炸上海，使上海人民的生命财产受到严重的损失。全国人民对上海人民的牺牲都抱绝大的同情，而对国民党残匪特别是他们的主使者美国帝国主义则抱绝大的仇恨。我们一定要在今年内报复这个仇恨！
    上海的和全国的同胞们永远记着：美国帝国主义是这次轰炸的首要罪魁。第一，轰炸的飞机和炸弹都是美国供给的。美国直到最近还在以“拨款”的名义、商业的名义或菲律宾的名义供给台湾残匪以军火，这是任何杜鲁门声明、艾奇逊声明、耶塞普声明所不能掩盖的。第二，驾驶轰炸机和实行轰炸的匪方空军人员包括美国人和日本的所谓“志愿军”。如果不经美国政府和麦克阿瑟总部的同意，这样的事实是不可能发生的。国民党残余的空军如果没有日本人和美国人驾驶，就不能举行这样的轰炸。第三，尤其值得注意的是，二月六日的轰炸准确地炸毁了美商杨树浦上海电力公司。毫无疑问，只有得到了华盛顿的命令，效忠于美国的台湾空军才敢于这样做。
    美国帝国主义者近来天天宣传他们对于中国的“友谊”，以及苏联对于中国的“侵略”。但是看一个简单的事实吧：这次轰炸上海，以及过去无数次轰炸中国解放区的，究竟是苏联的飞机呢，还是美国的飞机呢？每个中国人只要记住这一点，就自然而然地弄清楚全部真相，弄清楚必须联合什么朋友而反对什么敌人了。
    上海的轰炸告诉全国同胞：中国在一九五○年还是处在紧张的激烈的战争中。必须彻底铲除国民党残匪，必须解放台湾、舟山群岛、海南岛和西藏，从全中国肃清美国帝国主义和日本帝国主义的走狗势力，中国人民的生存和建设才能得到保障。
    我们是一个已经经历了十多年战争而得到了胜利的勇敢的民族。在这最后一年的战争中，敌人所加给我们的最后的破坏，只能够使我们加强战斗的意志，加速战斗的步伐罢了！让我们团结一致，援助上海人民，迅速恢复敌人给我们的破坏，并且用一切方法把敌人迅速消灭干净！
