　　*Water Dwellers*
　　Fang Hong
    Under reactionary rule, fishermen, like other working people, suffered from the cruel exploitation and oppression of the reactionary ruling class, living an inhuman existence.

    In the past, the "literary figures and gentlemen" who helped the ruling class often described the life of fishermen in a very beautiful way, praising "Fisherman's Joy" with an attitude of appreciation. The film *Water Dwellers* truthfully portrays the life of fishermen's blood and tears and shatters the lies used by the ruling class to whitewash peace and deceive the people.

    In *Water Dwellers*, we see how fishermen in the old society risked their lives to fish in storms and turbulent waves, but the fruits of their sweat and toil were exploited by the fishing industry bosses through usury, low-price monopoly purchases, and rent increases, leaving them unable to feed and clothe themselves and still owing the bosses debts they could never repay. As a result, they were forced to heartlessly watch their children die because they could not afford medical treatment, and even sell their daughters to pay off debts. They lived their lives in hardship and despair, seeking stimulation only through drinking and gambling. This was the miserable life of fishermen in the old society, this is the class hatred we must never forget! However, the days when fishing industry bosses exploited fishermen were bound to end. Although they used violence to oppress fishermen, "trustworthiness" to deceive fishermen, and wanted to make fishermen more obedient by running schools, and used petty favors to individual fishermen to undermine the unity of fishermen, and used all sorts of means to consolidate their rule; but as Mai Zhixin, the son of the fishing industry boss Mai Taigong, declared to his father: "This world will one day not belong to you!"

    *Water Dwellers* uses "Tianmen Bay" to hint at the liberated new Chinese fishing village: there are electrified fishing boats in state-owned fishing grounds, weather stations report the climate to fishermen, fishery banks provide interest-free loans to fishermen, and fishery cooperatives organized by fishermen themselves uniformly sell and transport fish products; there, fishermen no longer live a happy and prosperous life, exploited and oppressed. This is the ideal that fishermen pursue. In *Water Dwellers*, we can see how the younger generation of fishermen eagerly pursue the arrival of this ideal, and persuade and lead the older fishermen to break away from the dark old society and head for the light.

    This is the theme of *Water Dwellers*. *Water Dwellers* successfully expresses this theme.

    At the same time, *Water Dwellers* also movingly expresses the great class friendship of the working people. We see a fisherman who is not well-fed himself resolutely take in the orphan left behind by his unfortunate partner after his suicide, saying to the orphan with tears in his eyes: You follow me, what I eat, you eat too. We also see fishermen, whose families were devastated by storms, generously taking out their few remaining coins to raise money to pay off their poor partner's debts, trying to rescue his daughter Azhu who was forced to be sold; and Abao, who was forced into prostitution and ruined by Mai Taigong, took out all her jewelry to prevent Azhu from falling into the same tragic fate as her, even though Azhu was her rival in love.

    In addition, *Water Dwellers* also uses Mai Zhixin, the son of Mai Taigong, to illustrate the way out for intellectuals from the reactionary class, which is to rebel against their own class and join the ranks of the working people. At the same time, *Water Dwellers*'s assessment of the role of Mai Zhixin is also appropriate, it does not write this kind of person as the savior of the working people, as some movies do.

    *Water Dwellers* does have shortcomings. The connection between the fishing industry boss and the political system of the reactionary ruling class is not well expressed in the film, so it is easy for some viewers to see the crimes of the entire social system as just the problems of certain individuals. The development process of Mai Zhixin's progressive ideas is not expressed profoundly enough. In dealing with love conflicts, there are individual places - mainly manifested in Jinhua, which weaken the expression of the main contradiction of class struggle.

    In short, *Water Dwellers* is a movie worth recommending. It is even more rare that the screenwriters, directors, and actors went deep into the fishing villages under imperialist rule in Hong Kong to shoot this film.

　　《水上人家》
　　方虹
    在反动统治下，渔民正如其他劳动人民一样，受着反动统治阶级残酷的剥削和压迫，过着非人的生活。
    从前为统治阶级帮闲的“文人雅士”们，常常以欣赏的态度，把渔民的生活描写得非常美丽，讴歌《渔家乐》。《水上人家》这影片就真实地表现了渔民血泪的生活而粉碎了这种统治阶级用来粉饰太平、欺骗人民的谎言。
    在《水上人家》里，我们看到了旧社会中的渔民们如何冒着性命危险在惊风骇浪中打鱼，但他们血汗换来的果实却被渔行老板用高利贷、低价垄断收买，以及加租等手段剥削得精光，使他们终日不得温饱而仍欠着老板们永远还不清的账。就这样，他们被迫忍心看着自己的孩子没钱治病而死去，甚至为还不清债而卖掉了自己的女儿。他们在困苦失望中过着日子，而只得以喝酒、赌钱、来找寻刺激。这是旧社会中渔民的悲惨生活，这是我们永远不能忘记的阶级仇恨！但是，渔行老板剥削渔民的日子是必然会结束的。虽然他用暴力来压迫渔民，用“信义”来欺骗渔民，用办学校想使渔民更听话，施用给个别渔民小惠以破坏渔民的团结，用各色各样的手段想来巩固他的统治；但是正如渔行老板麦太公的儿子麦志新向他的父亲宣称：“这世界总有一天不是属于你的！”
    《水上人家》用“天门湾”来暗示出解放了的新中国渔村：那里有国营渔场电气化的渔船，有气象台向渔民报告气候，有渔民可以无息贷款的渔业银行，有渔民自己组织的统销统运渔产的渔业合作社；在那里，渔民们不再受人剥削、受人压迫地过着愉快富足的生活。这是渔民们所追求的理想。在《水上人家》里，我们可以看到年青一代的渔民是如何殷切地追求着这个理想的来临，并且说服、带动了年老的渔民们一同摆脱了黑暗的旧社会而奔向光明。
    这是《水上人家》的主题。《水上人家》表现这个主题是成功的。
    同时，《水上人家》还动人地表现了劳动人民伟大的阶级友爱。我们看到一个自己衣食不周的渔民毅然地留下他不幸的伙伴自杀后所留下的孤儿，含着热泪向孤儿说：你跟着我，我吃什么你也吃什么。我们又看到在受到风浪袭击而家产荡然的渔民们慷慨地拿出他们仅有的几个钱，凑起来为他们可怜的伙伴还账，想救出他被迫出卖的女儿阿珠；而被麦太公逼得家破人亡而沦落为娼的阿宝，为了使阿珠不再堕入与她一样的悲惨命运，拿出了她所有的手饰，虽然阿珠正是她的情敌。
    此外，《水上人家》还用麦太公的儿子麦志新来说明了出身于反动阶级中知识分子的出路，只有反叛本阶级，投入劳动人民的阵营。而同时，《水上人家》对麦志新这一人物作用的估计也是恰当的，它并没有像某些电影一样，把这种人物写作劳动人民的救世主。
    《水上人家》的缺点还是有的。电影中表现渔行老板和反动统治阶级的政治制度的联系还不够，因此容易使一部分观众把整个社会制度的罪恶看作只是某些个人的问题。麦太公的儿子麦志新进步思想的发展过程，还表达得不够深刻。在处理恋爱的矛盾上，有个别的地方——主要表现在晋华身上，削弱了阶级斗争这一主要矛盾的表现。
    总之，《水上人家》是个值得推荐的电影。而编导者和演员们在帝国主义统治下的香港深入渔村来拍摄这个电影，更是件很难得的事。
