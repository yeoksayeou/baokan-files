Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, February 12th: The colonial war waged by British imperialists against the people of Malaya striving for independence has aroused an increasingly large wave of protests among progressive people in Britain. Expressing the will of the British masses, the Executive Committee of the British Communist Party declared that the war in Malaya is an armed aggression against the workers, farmers, and peace-loving people of Malaya. Continuing this war will only serve the interests of tin and rubber monopolies, at the expense of the interests of the people of Malaya and Britain.

　　The Worker's Daily emphasized that thousands of British soldiers have died in Malaya. The war weighs heavily on the shoulders of the British working people. The war in Malaya costs Britain approximately 100 million pounds each year. The total war expenditure has already reached 150 million pounds. This war is profitable for big capitalists and adventurers who extract huge profits from it. The Malayan Tin Company Limited announced that it had obtained a profit of £200,008, of which 50 percent was paid as dividends. South Malayan Tin Company Limited obtained a profit of £328,000, of which 60 percent was paid as dividends.

　　British imperialists have established a police reign of terror in Malaya. More than 10,000 people have been arrested and imprisoned, and even more have been expelled from their villages for allegedly supporting the guerrillas. Thousands have been brutally killed or injured, their homes burned down, and their property destroyed. According to a law enacted on November 1, 1949, the local colonial government ordered employers to compile blacklists of workers. The people of Malaya are living in conditions similar to those during the Japanese militarist occupation.

　　However, despite spending large sums of money, the British imperialists' attempts to crush the Malayan People's Liberation Army and undermine the morale of the Malayan people have been a complete failure. News from Malaya indicates that the activities of the People's Liberation Army forces, which are bravely attacking the British army, are growing daily.

　　反对在马来亚进行殖民战争
    英人民抗议浪潮扩大   
    工人日报指出：战争严重地残害了马来亚和英国人民！
    【新华社北京十二日电】塔斯社伦敦十一日讯：英帝国主义者所进行的反对力争独立的马来亚人民的殖民战争，引起英进步人士方面越来越大的抗议浪潮。英共执委会表达英国人民群众的意志时宣称，在马来亚进行的战争是反对马来亚的工人、农民及爱好和平的人民的武装侵略行动。继续进行这一战争，只会符合于锡和橡胶垄断企业的利益，而以牺牲马来亚和英国人民的利益为代价。
    工人日报着重指出，成千的英国士兵已死在马来亚。战争沉重地压在英国劳动人民的肩上。马来亚的战争每年使英国花费一亿镑左右的金钱。战争的开支总加起来当已达一亿五千万镑。这个战争对于大资本家和冒险家是有利可图的，他们从这个战争中吸取巨额利润。马来亚采锡有限公司宣称，它获得了二十万零八千镑的利润，其中百分之五十付了红利。南马来亚采锡有限公司获得了三十二万八千镑的利润，其中百分之六十付了红利。
    英帝国主义者在马来亚建立了警察恐怖统治。一万余人被捕入狱，因被指声援游击队而被逐离乡村的人数更多，数千人惨被杀死或受伤，住所被焚毁，财产荡然无存。根据一九四九年十一月一日制定的法律，当地殖民政府令雇主编制工人的黑名单。马来亚人民处在类似日本军国主义者占领时期的生活情况中。
    但是，英帝国主义者尽管花费大量的金钱，它粉碎马来亚人民解放军及败坏马来亚人民的民气的企图，却仍然是彻底失败了。马来亚的消息指明：向英军英勇攻击的人民解放军部队的活动，正日益增长。
