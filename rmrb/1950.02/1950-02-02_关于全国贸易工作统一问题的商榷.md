　　Discussion on the Unification of National Trade Work
    Yang Bo
    With the further victory of our People's Liberation War on the mainland, except for a few islands such as Taiwan, Hainan Island, and the Zhoushan Islands, as well as Tibet, which are still occupied by the remnants of the Kuomintang reactionaries, all other areas have been liberated. The major administrative regions within the country are completely connected geographically, and economic exchanges between regions have become increasingly close. Therefore, the issue of how various national undertakings can be quickly, systematically, and step-by-step unified under the leadership of the central government from the past decentralized leadership has become a pressing problem to be solved in our current work.
    In the past, our domestic and foreign trade work basically adopted the principle of "unified leadership, decentralized operation." During the Anti-Japanese War and the first three years of the Liberation War, all major cities, main land and sea transportation lines, and major industrial and mining production were successively controlled by Japanese imperialism and the Kuomintang reactionaries. At that time, our liberated areas were mainly scattered and backward rural areas that were divided and blockaded by the enemy. Under such circumstances, in order to adapt to the decentralized guerrilla warfare, all our work had to adopt the principle of "regional management." Even within a large strategic area, each sub-region had to do the same. This is the historical condition that led to the formation of a certain degree of independence, autonomy, and self-sufficiency in past financial and economic work.
    After the victories of the Jin-Jing and Huaihai campaigns last year, the basic victory of our People's Liberation War on a national scale has brought about new changes in the above-mentioned historical conditions. The situation of division and blockade between the old liberated areas no longer exists. Many large and medium-sized cities and transportation lines have been brought under our control, enabling various national undertakings to move towards unification. However, this does not mean that everything is unified. For example, the unified leadership of domestic and foreign trade work had not yet begun last year. The main reasons are:
    (1) The objective situation we faced last year was still a war environment. From the liberation of Tianjin and Beijing at the beginning of the year to the liberation of Nanjing, Shanghai, Hangzhou, and Wuhan in the summer, until the liberation of the vast areas of South China, Southwest China, and Northwest China in the autumn and winter, a series of battles were carried out from north to south. In order to concentrate our efforts to support the Liberation War, all our institutions were not suitable for drastic reforms. Our local work must be closely integrated with military actions to implement unified leadership at the local level. Under such circumstances, if our various business operations were to adopt vertical leadership from top to bottom, we would encounter many serious difficulties.
    (2) More than half of the regions were newly liberated areas. In this vast area, our primary task was, on the one hand, to concentrate our efforts to eliminate the remnant Kuomintang reactionary troops and local bandits, and stabilize social order; on the other hand, to carry out various takeover tasks and gradually establish our various financial and economic institutions. At this time, if the local economic work institutions have not yet been established or improved, proposing unified leadership of national trade work would be of no avail.
    (3) Before October last year, there was no unified central people's government in the country. Therefore, various tasks could only be led by local governments by region. Before the establishment of the Central People's Government, our financial and economic work could only have unified policies and guidelines, and a certain degree of unified planning, but it was not possible to propose the issue of unified leadership of national trade work.
    From this, it is not difficult to understand that the principle of "unified leadership, decentralized operation" that we implemented in trade work in the past was absolutely necessary. It is precisely because we grasped this principle that we were able to develop our past trade work and have such a strong foundation for state-owned trade work today.
    However, the current situation has undergone fundamental changes. The objective conditions in our domestic and foreign trade work are now different from the past. This is mainly reflected in: (1) The Liberation War has basically ended on the Chinese mainland. At present, our central task, on a national scale, is mainly to restore and develop production and carry out economic construction. (2) The Central People's Government and the highest leading organ for trade work—the Ministry of Trade—have been established. The trade work of various localities has been unified under the unified leadership of the people's governments of the major administrative regions, and various trade institutions in the vast newly liberated areas are being established one after another. (3) The national currency system (excluding Northeast China) has been unified, and the work of bank remittance has been carried out. (4) Transportation undertakings such as railways, highways, shipping, and postal and telecommunications have also been largely restored in the past year, and the country is unified. (5) Due to the liberation of major cities, the problem of urban supply is becoming increasingly serious, and it cannot be solved by relying on one region alone. It is necessary to coordinate and adjust on a national scale. (6) Countries have successively established diplomatic relations with us and conducted business negotiations, and large-scale international trade is gradually recovering and developing.
    Under these new historical conditions, if our domestic and foreign trade work cannot quickly establish national unified leadership, unified planning, and unified allocation, it will put our future trade work in a passive and unfavorable position. For example, regarding the work of stabilizing prices, in the past when each region had its own currency issuance and circulation, if a certain region experienced currency devaluation and price increases, other regions only needed to adjust the exchange rate between the two regions to avoid being affected. However, in today's situation where currency, transportation, and markets are unified nationwide, the situation is very different. A price increase in one place will quickly affect other regions. Under such circumstances, if we do not take unified measures to stabilize prices on a national scale, it is fundamentally impossible for any region to maintain its local stability alone. The same is true for the work of allocating materials and ensuring urban supply on a national scale. For example, in the four months from August to December last year, under the unified leadership of the Central Financial and Economic Committee, major administrative regions mutually transferred more than 500 million jin of various grains, more than 40 million jin of cotton, nearly 2 million bolts of cloth, more than 15,000 pieces of yarn, more than 100 million jin of edible salt, and 280,000 tons of coal and other major materials. This year, the amount of transfer will be five to ten times more than this. Such a large amount of material transfer on a national scale is unimaginable without unified organization and planning. In addition, in order to strengthen the leadership and management of private commerce and combat its speculative activities, our state-owned trade work must also be unified. The market activities of private commerce are very sensitive and are national in scope. In the past, they often took advantage of the disunity in the leadership of our local economic work, such as the high and low prices, the high and low tax rates, and the high and low exchange rates, to carry out various speculative activities. The result of such speculation often disrupted our material allocation plans. Many materials originally had a certain production and sales area, and reasonable price differences between regions; but often due to the rush purchases and sales of merchants, this caused abnormal price phenomena and caused material reversal. In order to avoid this abnormal phenomenon, our state-owned trading companies must take the initiative to carry out unified allocation work. In foreign trade, due to the lack of unity among various regions, our own work has suffered certain losses in recent years. For example, for similar export goods, some regions have unified sales, while others have free exports, which makes it easy for merchants to take advantage of loopholes. Regarding imported goods, due to the lack of mutual understanding of the overall production situation in various regions, often some goods that can be manufactured domestically are still purchased abroad, resulting in a large waste of foreign exchange.
    Based on the above situation, we believe that proposing the unification of national domestic and foreign trade work today, from policy guidelines to specific business operations, is in line with the historical development requirements of the current overall work. This is one aspect. But on the other hand, we must also admit that there are still many difficulties in this unification process: for example, the central government does not yet have enough understanding of many specific situations in various regions; the institutions of the Ministry of Trade are not yet very sound; after unification, there may be many specific difficulties in various regions that cannot be resolved in a timely manner; local trade institutions are also unsound, and some regions are yet to be established, and may not be able to complete the tasks assigned by the central government; these are all specific difficulties in the current unification process. Therefore, our unification work should also distinguish between priorities and urgencies, and first unify several important businesses. Although both unification and non-unification have difficulties, weighing the pros and cons, we believe that the difficulties of unification are smaller and the benefits are greater. Moreover, we believe that all the above-mentioned difficulties after unification can be gradually resolved reasonably in the process of unification. In recent months, under the leadership of the Central Financial and Economic Committee, the Ministry of Trade has successively convened national professional meetings on tea, oils and fats, fur, bristles, silk, urban supply, edible salt, grain, import, etc., and formulated unified national business operation plans for 1950 respectively; and decided to immediately establish leading organs and branches of national unified professional companies for domestic and foreign trade. The convening of all these meetings and the formulation of plans have laid a favorable foundation for us to unify the national trade work. We hope that on this basis, we can quickly unify the national domestic and foreign trade work. 1950, 1, 25

　　关于全国贸易工作统一问题的商榷
    杨波
    随着我人民解放战争在大陆上进一步的胜利，目前全国除台湾、海南岛、舟山群岛等几个海岛及西藏一地，仍为残余的国民党反动派盘据外，其它地区已全部解放；国内各大行政区在地理上已完全联成一片，各区间的经济往来已日益密切，因之，各种全国性的事业，如何能够迅速地、有主有从有步骤地由过去的分区领导统一于中央领导，已成为当前我们各种工作中一个急待解决的问题。
    过去我们的国内外贸易工作，基本上是采取“统一领导，分散经营”的方针。在抗日战争时期及解放战争的前三年，全国的大中城市，海陆交通干线，各种主要的工矿业生产，皆先后被日本帝国主义与国民党反动派所控制，当时我们解放区所处的环境，主要是被敌人分割封锁的分散落后的农村。在这种情况下，为了适应分散的游击战争，我们的一切工作，皆不得不采取“分区管理”的方针。甚至在一个大战略区之内的各个分区，亦必须如此。这就是过去财经工作所以形成一定程度的独立自主、自足自给局面的历史条件。
    去年京津、淮海两大战役胜利结束后，我人民解放战争在全国范围内的基本胜利，已使我上述所处的历史条件，发生了新的变化，各老解放区之间的分割封锁局面已不存在，许多大中城市及交通干线已为我掌握，使全国各种事业都已走向统一的局面。但是这并不是说我们一切都统一了，如国内外的贸易工作在去年就还未开始统一领导。其主要原因：
    （一）去年我们所处的客观形势仍为战争环境。从年初的津京解放到夏季的宁、沪、杭、武汉的解放，直到秋冬华南、西南、西北广大地区的解放，由北而南都进行了一系列的作战，为了集中力量支援解放战争，我们的一切机构皆不宜于作急剧的改革；我们的地方工作，亦即必须紧密地与军事行动结合起来，实行地方上一元化的领导。在这种情况下，我们的各种业务工作，如分别采取自上而下的垂直领导，则将遇到许多严重困难。
    （二）一半以上的地区，为新解放地区。在这广大的区域里，我们的首要任务，一方面是集中力量肃清残余的国民党反动军队与地方土匪，安定社会秩序；另方面则是进行各种接管工作，并逐渐建立我们的各种财经工作机构。这时如果在地方上的经济工作机构尚未建立或健全起来，提出全国贸易工作的统一领导，也是无济于事的。
    （三）在去年十月份以前，全国还没有统一的中央人民政府，因之各种工作亦只能由各地方政府分区领导。在中央人民政府成立前，我们的财经工作只可能有统一的政策方针，和某种程度上的统一计划，还不可能提出全国贸易工作的统一领导问题。
    由此，不难了解，过去我们在贸易工作上所执行的“统一领导，分散经营”的方针，是完全必须的。也正由于我们掌握了这一方针，因之才可能使我们过去的贸易工作，得到了发展；才有了今天这样强大的国营贸易工作的基础。
    但是目前的情况，已发生了根本的变化。在我国内外贸易工作上的客观条件，现在也和过去不同了。这主要表现在：（一）解放战争在中国大陆上已基本结束。目前我们的中心任务，就全国范围讲，主要为恢复与发展生产，进行经济建设。（二）中央人民政府及贸易工作的最高领导机关——中央贸易部——业已成立。各地方的贸易工作已先后统一于各大行政区人民政府的统一领导，广大新解放区的各种贸易机构，已在陆续设立中。（三）统一了全国的货币制度（不包括东北），开展了银行通汇工作。（四）铁路、公路、航运、邮电等交通事业，一年来亦大体上已恢复，而且全国是统一的。（五）由于各大城市解放，城市供应问题日益繁重，单靠一个地区不能解决，必须全国统盘调剂。（六）各国陆续与我建立外交关系，进行商务谈判，大规模的国际贸易，已在逐渐恢复与发展。
    在这些新的历史条件下，我们的国内外贸易工作，如不能迅速建立全国性的统一领导，统一计划，统一调拨，则将使我们今后的贸易工作处于被动的不利地位。例如关于稳定物价工作，在过去各区货币分区发行分区流通的时期，如果某一地区发生货币贬值物价上涨，其它各区只须在两区间的货币比价上加以调整，即可免受牵连。但在货币、交通、市场等全国统一后的今天，情况即大不相同。一地物价上涨，别区很快即会遭受影响。在这种情况下，如我们不采取从全国范围来统一的稳定物价，任何一个地区要想单独保持其局部稳定，那是根本不可能的。在全国范围内的调剂物资，保证城市供应的工作上，亦是如此，如去年八月至十二月的四个月中，在中央财经委员会的统一领导下，各大行政区之间，互相调运了各种粮食五万万余斤，棉花四千多万斤，布将近二百万匹，纱一万五千余件，食盐一亿多斤，煤二十八万吨等主要物资，今年调运数额将要比这多五倍至十倍。如此全国性的大量物资调运，如没有统一的组织和计划，亦是不可想像的。此外，为了加强对私人商业的领导管理，打击其投机活动，我们的国营贸易工作亦必须统一领导，私营商业的市场活动是很灵敏的，而且带有全国性的。过去常常利用我们各地经济工作领导上的不统一，如物价高低，税额高低，外汇牌价高低等，而进行各种投机活动。这样投机的结果，经常在破坏着我们的物资调拨计划，很多物资本来是有其一定的产销地区，及各区间合理的差价；但往往由于商人的抢购、抛售，却造成此项价格的反常现象，引起物资倒流，为避免此种不正常的现象，就必须要我国营贸易公司主动进行统一的调剂工作。在对外贸易方面，由于各地区不统一，近年来亦曾使我们自己的工作，受到了一定的损失，如同类的出口货物，有些地区统销，有些地区自由输出，即便利了商人从中钻空子。进口货物方面，亦由于各区间互相不了解全面的生产情况，往往有些货物本国本可制造，结果仍到国外采购，形成了外汇上很大的浪费。
    根据以上情况，我们认为今天提出统一全国的内外贸易工作，无论从政策方针到具体业务经营，均是符合于当前整个工作历史发展要求的，这是一方面。但另方面，我们也必须承认，在这统一过程中，还存在着许多困难：如中央对各地区的许多具体情况，了解的还不够；中央贸易部的机构还不很健全；统一了以后，各地区可能会有许多具体困难不能及时得到解决；地方贸易机构也不健全，有些地区尚待建立，可能完成不了中央所规定的任务；这皆是当前统一过程中的具体困难。因此我们的统一工作，亦应当分别轻重缓急，先把几种重要业务统一起来。虽然统一与不统一两者皆有困难，但权衡轻重，我们认为还是统一的困难小，好处多。而且上述一切统一后的困难，我们相信在统一的过程中，是可以逐渐得到合理解决的。近几个月来在中央财政经济委员会领导下，中央贸易部曾先后召开了全国的茶叶、油脂、皮毛、猪鬃、丝绸、城市供给、食盐、粮食、进口等专业会议，分别制订了一九五○年全国统一的业务经营计划；并决定即行成立全国统一的各内外贸易专业公司的领导机关与分支机构。这一切会议的召开，计划的制订，已给我们打下了统一全国贸易工作的有利基础，我们希望在这一基础上，很快把全国的国内外贸易工作统一起来。一九五○，一，廿五
