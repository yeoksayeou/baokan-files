Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 11th: Six million Shanghai citizens, under the leadership of the working class, have launched a heroic counter-bombing struggle. After the bandit planes bombed Shanghai on the 6th, Shanghai citizens immediately mobilized and quickly started rescue, organization, and restoration work. Workers initially restored water and electricity within two hours of the bombing, ensuring electricity for streetlights, hospitals, newspapers, and other important places. When the streetlights came on, magnificent songs of "We Workers Have Power" echoed everywhere. Before the explosions had even stopped, personnel from factories, schools, hospitals, military garrisons, public security bureaus, and other places rushed to the bombed areas to carry out rescue work. The workers demonstrated a high degree of class solidarity and a spirit of loving the motherland and protecting public property. The workers of the Shanghai Electric Power Company did not rush to rescue their own bombed homes, but first rushed to rescue the machinery. After the bombs fell on the Shanghai Electric Power Company, workers from nearby No. 7, 12, and 37 factories of the China Textile Corporation, Yong'an Spinning Mill, Shanghai Steel No. 2 Factory, China Agricultural Machinery Company, and other places, immediately rushed to the rescue, regardless of their own safety. Zhang Laifa, a labor hero who was tragically killed in the bombing, requested that all his savings be used to buy public bonds before he died. Injured workers lying in the hospital with broken arms and legs swore to fight to the end against American imperialism and the remaining bandits. Engineers and workers from the bombed factories carried machines together and actively repaired them, not resting even in the pouring rain of the black night. Personnel from the public security organs also demonstrated a high degree of initiative. A police officer from the Songshan District Public Security Bureau was injured by smoke while rescuing victims from a fire. Patrol teams and worker pickets maintained order day and night. On the day after the bombing, a demonstration of buying public bonds and opposing the bombing was held in western Shanghai, filled with the anger of the masses. After his home was destroyed in the bombing, Zhou Geng, from the dyeing and weaving industry, immediately wrote a letter to the industry's public bond sales branch to buy 1,000 shares of public bonds. The East China Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Shanghai Municipal People's Government discussed measures for air defense, fire prevention, relief, and maintaining order overnight. Each bureau and office of the municipal government sent people to the affected factories to lead rescue work. In addition to concentrating their efforts on repairs, factory workers, scientific and technical personnel also actively studied methods of air defense and factory protection. Now Shanghai citizens are all involved in the counter-bombing struggle in an organized and planned way. This frenzied bombing of Shanghai by bandit planes is a vicious conspiracy by the remaining bandits in Taiwan, under the instructions of American imperialism, to paralyze greater Shanghai by destroying the city's electricity supply. The workers of the bombed Shanghai Electric Power Company pointed out: "This company is one of the largest American-owned industries in the Far East, and the remaining bandits would not dare to bomb it without American approval." Power plants in places such as the Zhabei Water and Electricity Plant of the French-owned Electric Tram and Lighting Company in Lujiawan, and the Nanshi Electric and Steam Company, were also partially damaged. In the bombing, residents of various districts suffered heavy losses due to the random dropping of heavy bombs by bandit planes. According to preliminary statistics, more than 500 citizens were killed, more than 1,000 were injured, more than 1,000 houses were destroyed, and 50,000 people were left homeless.
    [This Newspaper reports] According to a Xinhua News Agency dispatch: The people of Chongqing and Qingdao sent telegrams of condolences to the bombed Shanghai compatriots, and firmly stated that they would actively support the front line, liberate Taiwan as soon as possible, and avenge the dead compatriots in Shanghai. The citizens of Chongqing, who suffered deeply from the bombing by Japanese invaders during the Anti-Japanese War, expressed great indignation at the atrocities of the remaining bandits colluding with American imperialism and Japanese invaders to bomb the people of Shanghai. In particular, citizens of Jiang, Zhejiang, and Shanghai origin residing in Chongqing expressed unparalleled pain and anger at the bombing of their hometowns and the killing of their elders. The preparatory committee of the Chongqing Federation of Trade Unions, the preparatory committee of the Women's Federation, the preparatory committee of the Student Federation, the preparatory committee of the Federation of Literary and Art Workers, and other organizations jointly sent a telegram of condolences to the Shanghai compatriots on the 9th. The telegram stated: "We believe that this frenzied atrocity will only increase the anger of the people of the whole country, and will only strengthen the determination of the people of the whole country to quickly liberate Taiwan and the Zhoushan Islands. We Chongqing citizens will unite as one, contribute our strength, and support the People's Liberation Army in completing the final task of eliminating the remaining bandits, as our greatest mourning for our dead Shanghai compatriots and our assistance to the people of Shanghai."
    The Qingdao Youth League, the preparatory committee of the Women's Federation, the preparatory committee of the Student Federation, and other organizations also jointly issued a written statement stating: We must complete the task of purchasing public bonds and vigorously support the People's Liberation Army in liberating all of China.

　　上海六百万市民在工人阶级领导下
    展开反轰炸斗争
    重庆青岛各界电慰被难同胞
    【新华社上海十一日电】上海六百万市民在工人阶级领导下，展开英勇的反轰炸斗争。六日匪机轰炸上海后，上海市民立即紧急动员起来，迅速展开救护、整理、修复工作。工人们在轰炸后两小时内即将水电初步修复，保证了路灯、医院、报馆和其他重要场所的用电。当路灯齐明时，各处洋溢着“我们工人有力量”的雄壮歌声。爆炸声还没有停止，各工厂、学校、医院、驻军、公安局等处人员即纷纷出动，到被炸地区进行抢救工作。工人们表现了高度的阶级友爱和爱祖国、爱护公共财物的精神。上海电力公司的工人们不去抢救被炸了的自己的家，而先去抢救机器。炸弹落在上海电力公司后，附近地区的中纺第七、十二、三十七厂，永安纱厂、上海钢铁第二厂、中国农业机械公司等处工人，都立即奋不顾身地赶去抢救。被炸惨死的劳动英雄张来发在临死时，要求把所有存款购买公债。躺在医院里折臂断腿的受伤工友们，咬牙切齿地宣誓要与美帝国主义和残余匪帮斗争到底。被炸各厂的工程师和工人们一起扛抬机器，积极整修，即使在大雨滂沱的黑夜也不休息。治安机关的工作人员也表现了高度的积极性。嵩山区公安局警士，到大火中抢救灾民而被烟薰伤。巡逻队和工人纠察队日以继夜地维持秩序。被炸次日，沪西举行了群情激愤的买公债反轰炸的示威游行。染织业周庚在住宅被炸毁后，立即写信给该业推销公债支会，买公债一千分。中共中央华东局和上海市人民政府各机关，连夜商讨防空、消防、救济、维持秩序的办法。市府各局处都派人到各受灾工厂领导抢救工作。各工厂职工、科学技术人员除集中力量进行抢修外，亦积极研究防空护厂的办法。现在上海市民都有组织有计划地投入反轰炸斗争的行动中。此次匪机对上海的疯狂轰炸，是台湾残匪在美帝国主义指示下，有计划地企图以摧毁沪市电力的供应来瘫痪大上海的毒辣阴谋。被炸的上海电力公司的工人们指出：“该公司是美商在远东最大产业之一，残匪如没有得到美国的同意是不敢轰炸的。”卢家湾法商电车电灯公司闸北水电厂、南市电汽公司等处电力厂亦部分受损。在轰炸中，因匪机乱投重磅炸弹，各区居民遭受重大损失，据初步统计：市民被炸死者达五百余人，伤千余人，民房被毁千余间，无家可归灾民达五万人。
    【本报讯】据新华社电讯：重庆和青岛两市的人民纷纷电慰上海被炸同胞，并坚决表示要积极支援前线，早日解放台湾，为上海死难同胞复仇。抗日战争期中深受日寇轰炸残害的重庆市民，对残余匪帮勾结美帝国主义和日寇来轰炸上海人民的暴行，表示了极大的愤慨。尤其是寄居在重庆的江、浙和上海籍的市民，对家乡被轰炸，父老被残杀，表示无比的痛心和愤恨。重庆市总工会筹委会、妇女联合会筹委会、学生联合会筹委会、文学艺术工作者联合会筹委会等团体，于九日联名致电慰问上海同胞。电文称：“我们相信这种疯狂的暴行，只有增加全国人民的愤怒，只有加强全国人民迅速解放台湾和舟山群岛的决心。我们重庆市民一定团结一致，贡献出我们的力量，支援人民解放军完成最后扫荡残余匪帮的任务，作为我们对我上海死难同胞的最大的哀悼和对上海人民的援助。”
    青岛市青年团、妇女联合会筹委会、学生联合会等团体亦联名发表书面声明称：我们必须完成购买公债任务，大力支援人民解放军解放全中国。
