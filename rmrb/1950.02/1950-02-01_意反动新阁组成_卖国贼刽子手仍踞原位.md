　　Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, January 31st: The new Italian cabinet was formed on the 27th. In the new cabinet, still formed by De Gasperi of the Christian Democratic Party, Foreign Minister Sforza, who represented the Italian government in signing treaties and agreements with the United States to sell out Italian independence several times; Interior Minister Scelba, famous for suppressing domestic democratic movements and massacring peaceful workers; and Defense Minister Pacciardi, regarded as a confidant by the American military clique, all remain in their original positions. Bella, the lackey of Italian big capital, still holds the reins of national finance; Gonella, the representative of the Vatican, continues his ideological poisoning work in the Ministry of Education; and Lombardo, representing the interests of American monopoly capital, is promoted to control foreign trade. Most of the other important departments are also in the hands of old faces. In the new cabinet, the Christian Democratic Party, representing the interests of domestic big capital and the Vatican and acting as an agent for foreign big capital, occupies twelve seats alone. The other two reactionary small parties, the Saragat Party and the Republican Party, each obtained two seats.
