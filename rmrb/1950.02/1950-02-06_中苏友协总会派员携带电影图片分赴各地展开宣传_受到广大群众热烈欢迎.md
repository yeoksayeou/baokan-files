　　China-Soviet Friendship Association Headquarters Sends Personnel to Various Regions with Film and Images for Promotion, Receiving Enthusiastic Welcome from the Masses

    [Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 5th] In order to assist local friendship associations in carrying out their work, the China-Soviet Friendship Association Headquarters dispatched personnel in three groups last month to various regions to conduct propaganda work related to the Soviet Union. The first group, carrying more than 800 Soviet construction images, went to Wuhan and Changsha for exhibitions, and is now returning to Zhengzhou, and will go to Kaifeng, Xuzhou and other places for exhibitions. The second group is a film and image work team, carrying Soviet films "The Defense of Stalingrad," "Konstantin," "May Day 1949," "The Volga River," "The Magic Flower" and 57 Soviet Union 32nd Anniversary commemorative images, which were screened in Zhangjiakou, then transferred to Baoding, and is now heading south along the Beijing-Hankou Railway, passing through Shijiazhuang, Xingtai, Handan, Xinxiang, Zhengzhou and will go west to Xi'an, Baoji and other places to work. The third group, carrying images of Soviet women's lives and work, arrived in Jinan after the exhibition in Tianjin, and will go to Nanjing, Shanghai and other places for exhibition. Wherever the work teams went, they were warmly welcomed by the masses. According to incomplete statistics, the number of viewers of exhibitions and screenings in various places reached 133,666 by the end of January. After watching the exhibition, the audience unanimously felt the importance of learning from the Soviet Union. A worker in Baoding said: "In the future, we must work hard to learn Soviet science and technology and keep up with the Soviet Union." A farmer who saw a tractor photo said: "When will we also use tractors? In the past, we only talked about leaning to one side, but we didn't understand it thoroughly. Now we understand that we must take the Soviet path."
