　　【Report from our newspaper in Shanxi】During the spring plowing preparations in Licheng County, Shanxi Province, the focus is on driving the entire county to begin rectifying mutual aid teams. During the second winter production inspection, Licheng County put forward the task of implementing the rectification of mutual aid teams during the spring plowing preparations. Each district then carried out the rectification of mutual aid organizations based on the principles of voluntary participation and mutual benefit. First, they focused on obtaining experience in typical villages, and then promoted it throughout the county. In the past ten days, Districts One, Two, Three, and Five have discovered some problems with the mutual aid teams last year during rectification in typical villages: for example, some teams had too many people, making it difficult to take care of leadership and inconvenient for doing work; some villages used mutual aid teams as units to carry out preferential treatment for military families, making farmers who participated in mutual aid feel that they had to do more preferential plowing if they joined the mutual aid teams; some teams rated strong and weak livestock with the same points, making households with strong livestock feel that they were at a disadvantage; some teams gave strong and weak laborers the same ten work points, which dissatisfied full laborers; some teams were still in arrears with wages from last year. After discovering these problems in the mutual aid teams in typical villages, each district unanimously believed that if they were not rectified immediately, the original mutual aid teams could not be consolidated, and new mutual aid teams could not be organized. This would not only affect today's spring plowing preparations, but also affect the upcoming spring plowing and sowing. The village branch of Huoxiangdao Village in District Three immediately conducted a detailed study of the above-mentioned problems found in the inspection, and also mobilized various teams to launch democratic discussions to formulate improvement measures. In the discussion, everyone unanimously believed that: these are shortcomings in progress, and the role played by the mutual aid teams in production last year cannot be buried. Each team also formulated several improvement measures: (1) Adjust each mutual aid team based on the principles of voluntary combination and convenience of work. (2) Decide to calculate work points based on the strength of labor, so as to achieve equal exchange and mutual benefit. (3) Preferential treatment for military families should not be based on mutual aid teams as units, but the village government should be advised to divide it equally according to the labor force of the entire village. (4) Accounts should be settled and work should be repaid in a timely manner, discuss things with each other more often, and hold fewer formal meetings. District One focused on Yuancun, District Five focused on Wangjiazhuang, District Two focused on Baojiajiao, and Wangbeiyou Village focused on their respective mutual aid teams, which were all discussed in detail and rectified. And they have each formulated current production plans. For example, after rectifying the mutual aid team in Wangbeiyou Village, District Two, labor hero Duan Fengde put forward the slogan "Spring is short, start early, spring plowing is not flustered." Under his call, the mutual aid teams in the entire village also formulated a detailed production work plan for the two months before spring plowing and sowing: (1) Continue to transport manure, and strive to deliver all the manure to the fields before the twelfth day of the first lunar month. (2) Plow the land universally once before spring plowing, and plow it horizontally and vertically. (3) Apply topdressing fertilizer to wheat fields universally, and strive to hoe them once before the Qingming Festival. (4) Teach the women in the entire mutual aid team how to hoe the fields. (5) Repair the side dikes and help households with insufficient fertilizer to find sources of fertilizer and make up for the lack of fertilizer. (6) Repair farm implements and send people to Taibei Village to exchange for forty catties of high-quality Bai Liusha grain seeds. Currently, the leaders of each district in the county are using these experiences to promote the rectification of mutual aid in various villages, further consolidate and expand the mutual aid teams, and mobilize the masses to work hard to accelerate spring plowing preparations.

　　春耕准备中黎城采用重点推动  着手整顿劳动互助
    【本报山西特讯】山西省黎城县春耕准备中，重点带动全县着手整顿互助组。黎城县在二次冬季生产检查中，提出春耕准备中贯彻整顿互助组的任务，各区即根据自愿互利的原则，进行整顿互助组织。首先着重典型村取得经验，然后推动全县。旬日以来，一、二、三、五等区在典型村整顿中，发现去年互助组存在一些问题：如有些组人数太多，领导上照顾不到，做活也不方便；有的村以互助组为单位，进行优军代耕，使参加互助组的农民感到参加互助要多代耕；有些组把强弱牲口评订一样的分数，有强牲口户感到吃亏；有些组劳力强弱全顶十分工，全劳力不满意，有些组还拖欠着去年的工资。各区在典型村互助组发现这些问题后，一致认为如不立即进行整顿，则原有互助组不能巩固，新的互助也组织不起来，不仅影响今天的春耕准备，更影响即将开展的春耕播种。三区火巷道村村支部立即对检查出的上述问题作了详细研究，又发动各组展开民主讨论，制订改进办法。在讨论中大家一致认为：这是进步中的缺点，不能埋没去年互助组在生产中所起的作用。各组并订出几个改进办法：（一）以自愿结合和做活方便为原则调整各个互助组。（二）决定以劳力强弱评分计工，做到等价交换，互不吃亏。（三）优军代耕不应以互助组为单位，要建议村政府按全村劳力平分。（四）要及时结账还工，有事多互相商量，少开形式会。一区重点为元村、五区以王家庄、二区以暴家脚、望北由村为重点，互助组也都经过详细讨论，进行了整顿。并且各自订出目前生产计划。如二区望北由村整顿互助组后，劳动英雄段逢德又提出“春短早动手，春耕不慌张”的口号，全村互助组在他的号召下，又详细订出春耕播种前两个月生产工作计划：（一）继续运粪，争取阴历正月十二日前，将粪全部送到地。（二）春耕前普遍耙地一次，并且要横顺耙。（三）麦地普上追肥，争取清明节前普锄一次。（四）教会全互助组中的妇女锄地。（五）修好边堰，帮助肥料不足户想出积肥来源，补足肥料。（六）修好农具，派人到台北村换回白柳沙优良品种谷籽四十斤。现全县各区领导正以这些经验推动各村整顿互助，进一步巩固扩大互助组，发动群众为加速春耕准备而努力。
