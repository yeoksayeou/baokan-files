Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, February 11th: TASS, Paris, February 10th: French Communist Party General Secretary Thorez stated in a speech in Tulle on the 8th that the reason for the fall of the Bidault government was due to the growing resentment of the masses. The resignation of the Socialist Party ministers proves the disastrous nature of their policies of poverty, reaction, and war. Until recently, they were jointly implementing this policy with other French parties, manipulated by the US. This also proves that the conspiracy of the Socialist Party leaders to exclude the Communist Party from power and split the working class and Republicans to benefit the reactionaries has failed to produce the desired effect. The united action of all working people is increasingly powerful in political struggles and in the struggle to satisfy economic and social demands."

Thorez claimed that the Socialist Party leaders are attempting, with new conspiracies, to masquerade as parliamentary opposition in order to help the reactionaries and fascists recombine their forces.

The bourgeoisie has lost all sense of national sentiment and now relies solely on insane police violence and fascist terror to inflict new and major sacrifices on the people, maintain starvation wages, abolish social insurance, continue the dirty war in Vietnam, and, against the will of the people, involve the country in a criminal war of aggression against our friends and allies – the Soviet Union.

Thorez pointed out: "But the plans of the enemies of the people will fail. All working people, Communists, Socialists, and Catholics, all Republicans, all peace advocates, regardless of the will of the Socialist Party leaders – who are enemies of unity – will unite and act as in 1934 to block the path of fascism and war, and to establish a democratic and united government. This government will be a government of progress, freedom, peace, and national independence."

Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, February 11th: In a situation where the French people are deeply dissatisfied with the Bidault government's reactionary policies, the French reactionaries are attempting to deceive the people by having the Socialist Party withdraw from the cabinet and are engaging in new political conspiracies. According to Agence France-Presse and other British and American news agencies, five Socialist Party cabinet members submitted their resignations to Bidault on the morning of the 4th, falsely claiming that it was due to some low-paid workers "demanding increased cost-of-living allowances." However, it is well known that just a few days earlier, the Socialist Party had fully supported the Bidault government in passing the unprecedentedly large military budget in French history and had rejected the Communist Party's proposal to stop the colonial war in Vietnam and reduce military spending in order to improve the lives of workers. Moreover, according to a United Press dispatch on January 25th, the Socialist Party even supported the Bidault cabinet in "severely punishing" workers participating in anti-war strikes. Furthermore, according to Agence France-Presse reports, "all Socialist Party members have assured Bidault that although they have left the cabinet, they will still support his government." Therefore, when Bidault submitted a list of replacements to the parliament on the 7th, the Socialist Party did not vote against it. These facts fully demonstrate that the Socialist Party's withdrawal from the cabinet is entirely a conspiracy planned by the French reactionary group. A TASS Paris dispatch, quoting a member of the National Assembly, pointed out that this action by the Socialist Party is nothing more than "an attempt to act as the opposition a few months before the election in order to gain power."

　　法社会党伪装政府反对派
    多列士揭穿骗局
    指出：法国劳动人民的团结，将击败人民敌人的计划
    【新华社北京十一日电】塔斯社巴黎十日讯：法国共产党总书记多列士于八日在蒂勒发表演说称：皮杜尔政府垮台的原因是由于群众的日益增长的愤慨。社会党部长们的辞职，证明了他们所奉行的贫穷、反动与战争的政策所具有的灾难性。他们直到最近，还与美记的法国其他政党共同执行着这种政策。这件事情也证明了社会党领袖们所采取的从政权中排除共产党及分裂工人阶级与共和分子以利反动派的阴谋，未能产生预期的效果。全体劳动人民的联合行动，在政治斗争及关于满足经济与社会要求的斗争方面，都日益有力。”
    多列士称，社会党领袖们正企图以新的阴谋，伪装议会反对派，来帮助反动派及法西斯分子重新结合他们的力量。
    资产阶级已丧失了一切民族感，现在只是依靠疯狂的警察暴力和法西斯恐怖，以达到使人民蒙受新的重大牺牲，保持吃不饱的工资和取消社会保险，继续在越南的肮脏战争，并违背人民意志，使国家卷入侵略我们的朋友与盟国——苏联的罪恶战争。
    多列士指出：“但是，人民的敌人的计划将告失败。一切劳动人民、共产党人、社会党人及天主教党人、一切共和分子、一切和平拥护者，不顾社会党领袖们——他们是团结的敌人——的意志，将像一九三四年一样团结和行动，以阻塞法西斯主义与战争的道路，以建立民主统一的政府。这个政府将是进步、自由、和平与民族独立的政府。”
    【新华社北京十一日电】在法国人民对皮杜尔政府的反动政策深刻不满的情势下，法国反动派企图以社会党退出内阁来欺骗人民，并进行新的政治阴谋。据法新社及英美其它通讯社消息，社会党阁员五人于四日晨向皮杜尔提出辞呈，伪称系为一部分低薪工人“要求增加生活津贴”。但众所周知，仅在数日之前，社会党即曾全力支持皮杜尔政府通过了法国历史上空前庞大的军事预算，并否决了共产党要求停止越南殖民战争，削减军费，以改善工人生活的提案。不仅如此，据合众社一月二十五日讯，社会党并支持皮杜尔内阁“严惩”参加反战罢工的工人。又据法新社报道，“所有社会党党员都对皮杜尔保证，他们虽已脱离内阁，仍将拥护他的政府”。故皮杜尔于七日向议会提出补缺名单时，社会党并不投票反对。这些事实已完全说明社会党的退出内阁，完全是法国反动集团策划的一个阴谋。塔斯社巴黎电引一位国民议会议员的谈话指出，社会党的这一行动，不过是“企图在选举前几个月的时间内，充当反对派，以利于取得政权”。
