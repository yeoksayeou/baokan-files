　　Beijing News: President of the Supreme People's Court, Shen Junru, attended and spoke at the Second Session of the Second Beijing Municipal People's Representatives Conference yesterday. He elaborated in detail on the opinions regarding the trial implementation of district people's courts in Beijing and Tianjin. Excerpts are as follows:

　　(Omitted preceding content) This time, I saw in the report on the implementation of the resolution of the previous representatives' conference by the Beijing Municipal People's Government, regarding the implementation of judicial work, that it mentioned the plan to establish district courts and is applying for instructions from the Government Administration Council. Also, in Mayor Nie's 1950 government work report, it was mentioned: Consider establishing several district people's courts based on the existing district mediation sections, as primary trial organs to handle general civil and criminal cases. Regarding this point, I would like to talk to the representatives about the recent handling of this matter in the Supreme Court.

　　How can judicial work be done well? How can disputes between the people be properly handled? Like other political work, it must be close to the people and rely on the people to truly relieve the people's pain and serve the people. Therefore, how to set up the primary judicial organs is very important. It is hoped that in the primary trial process, we can correctly understand why the people want to litigate and properly resolve it, at least to reduce the number of appeals. In the past, the judicial organs placed the focus of this work on the second instance, which was wrong. To resolve litigation well, the court must be combined with the people. In the past, courts always had to put on airs to make the people succumb. Now, there is no need for that at all. In the future, the court's spirit and form of trial will be completely different from the past. Even the pronouncement of judgment will not be merely reading a main text and finishing, but the entire reasoning and facts must be explained clearly, so that the plaintiff and defendant are sincerely convinced. "To make the people have no lawsuits" is our ultimate goal of judicial work. Of course, the ability of our judicial work cadres today and the general public's legal knowledge are not enough, and it cannot be achieved for a while.

　　Regarding the establishment of district people's courts, we have discussed it countless times in the past two months. The president of the Tianjin Municipal Court was also invited to Beijing to jointly draft measures. It has been decided to establish district people's courts under the municipal court. We know that Moscow Province in the Soviet Union has twenty-four district courts. Because the district courts are close to the people, they have very convenient conditions to investigate materials, and it is also easy to find witnesses, so it is more convenient to handle general cases.

　　Ordinary Cases Handled by District Courts, Major Cases Still Handled by Municipal Courts

　　But, should all cases be handed over to the district people's courts for handling? If so, the burden on the district people's courts would be too heavy, and things would not be done well. We must distinguish the nature of civil and criminal cases and classify them according to their seriousness. Relatively ordinary cases, such as disputes over housing and marriage, will be handled by the district courts. Serious or more complicated cases will still be handled by the municipal people's courts. Therefore, the municipal people's court is still a first-instance institution and also a second-instance institution. Cases tried by the district people's court that are not satisfied can still be appealed to the municipal people's court.

　　As for the issue of the levels of trial, we believe that the past three-trial system does not necessarily have to be maintained. Some cases, after being tried by the district court, can be finalized by the municipal court and become the final instance, and no further appeals can be made; cases originally tried by the municipal court in the first instance can be appealed to the Supreme Court. From the municipal trial to the Supreme Court will also be two levels of trial. Does this method deprive the people of the right to one level of appeal? No, we plan to make the restrictions on appealing over levels very broad, and it can still be remedied. If cases at all levels of litigation are truly handled improperly, the Supreme People's Court can review them.

　　Regarding the establishment of district people's courts, we have formulated preliminary opinions and submitted them to the Central People's Government. Soon, we will be able to start trial implementation in Beijing and Tianjin. As for how many district people's courts should be established, or where they should be located, it will be necessary to consult with the Beijing and Tianjin municipal people's governments to decide.

　　President Shen also put forward several opinions on the proposals of the representatives: First, he believes that Marxism-Leninism must be pursued universally and deeply, such as the proposal to transform the upper and middle-level intellectuals in this city, which he strongly agrees with. Also, there are many shop assistants and out-of-school children, so can evening classes be opened separately in primary and secondary schools using evening time? Second, he agrees with the proposal to use vacant land in agencies and residences to reward production, not to plant flowers and trees but to plant vegetables and fruits, so as to urbanize the countryside. Third, regarding hospitals, add more beds, Western medicine is too expensive, and the municipal government should run a standard pharmacy to facilitate patients, etc.

### 京各界代表会议第二日  沈钧儒院长亲临讲话  阐述试办区法院意见

　　京各界代表会议第二日
    沈钧儒院长亲临讲话  阐述试办区法院意见
    【北京讯】最高人民法院沈钧儒院长昨日亲临北京市第二届第二次各界人民代表会议讲话，对即将在京津两市试办区人民法院的意见阐述甚详，特摘录如下：
    （前略）这次我看到北京市人民政府在执行上次各界代表会议决议案报告表里关于司法工作的执行情形也有报告，其中并提到今后拟成立区法庭，在申请政务院核示中，同时在聂市长的一九五○年市政府工作报告里也提到：考虑以原有的各区调解科为基础，建立若干区人民法院，作为初审机关，受理一般民刑案件。关于这一点我想向各位代表先生谈一谈在最高法院方面最近关于这事的处理情形。
    司法工作怎样能做得好？怎样能适当地处理人民和人民之间的纠纷，这也与其他政治工作一样，必须要接近人民依靠人民才能真正的为人民解除痛苦，为人民服务。因此，初审司法机构如何设置是非常重要的，希望在初审过程中能够正确地理解人民为什么要诉讼，适当地给予解决，至少能使上诉事件减少。过去的司法机关把这一工作重点放在二审上，是不对的，诉讼要解决得好，必须法院和人民结合在一道，过去法院总不免要摆出一些尊严的样子，使人民慑服，现在根本就不要如此。将来的法院关于审判精神形式均将与过去完全不同，就是宣判也决不是仅仅宣读一主文下，一定要把整个理由事实说明得清清楚楚，使得原被告心悦诚服，“使民无讼”才是我们司法工作最后真正的目标。当然，我们今天的司法工作干部的能力和一般人民的法律知识还不够，一时还不能做到如此。
    关于设立区人民法院的事两个月来不知商议过多少次，天津市法院院长也曾邀约来京共同草拟办法，经已决定在市法院之下设立区人民法院。我们知道苏联莫斯科一省就有二十四个区法院。因为区法院接近人民有很便利的条件来调查材料，也容易找到人证，处理一般案件就比较方便。
    普通案件归区法院办理情节重大者仍归市法院
    但，是不是所有案件都交给区人民法院去处理呢？如果是那样，区人民法院的负担就太重了，事情反而办不好，我们要就民刑案件的性质分别轻重，把比较普通的案件，如关于房屋、婚姻一类纠纷问题，归区法院办理，情节重大或是比较复杂的案件，仍由市人民法院来处理。因此，市人民法院仍为一审机构同时也是二审机构，区人民法院审理不服的案件还可以到市人民法院去上诉。
    至于审级问题，我们认为过去的三审制不一定非保持不可，有些案件经过区审后，市审就可以终结，成为终审机关，不能再上诉；原先经过市法院初审的可以上诉到最高法院，由市审到最高法院也将是二个审级，如此办法是不是剥夺了人民一级上诉的权利呢？不是的，我们打算把越级上诉限制放得非常宽，还可以补救，各级诉讼案件如真有处理不当的，最高人民法院可以提审。
    关于设立区人民法院事，我们已拟定初步意见呈报中央人民政府，不久当即可在京津两市着手试办，至于区人民法院应该设立几个，或是设在什么地方，届时须与京津两市人民政府商洽决定办理。
    其他沈院长对于本届代表们提案提出了几点意见：一、认为马列主义必须求其普遍深入，如本市上中层知识分子的改造提案非常赞同。又店员及失学儿童数量亦多，可否在中小学校利用晚上时间分别开设夜班。二、赞成提案中利用机关及住宅空地奖励生产，不种花树种蔬果，使城市农村化。三、关于医院方面，增添病床，西药太贵，由市府来办一标准药房以便利病人等。
