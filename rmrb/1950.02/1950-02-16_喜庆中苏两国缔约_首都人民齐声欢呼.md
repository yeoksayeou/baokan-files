Celebrating the Treaty Between China and the Soviet Union
The People of the Capital Cheer in Unison

[Reported by this newspaper] The Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance, and Mutual Assistance, along with the agreements between China and the Soviet Union regarding the Chinese Changchun Railway, Lushun (Port Arthur) and Dalian (Dairen), and loans, were announced yesterday (the 15th). This immediately sparked enthusiastic praise and cheers from people of all sectors in the capital. The unanimous opinion throughout the city is that this treaty and these agreements not only guarantee peace in the East but will also play a significant role in world peace. It is truly equal and mutually beneficial, truly friendly.

Workers in various factories expressed immense excitement and heartfelt support for this treaty and the two agreements. Mu Ruihong of the Beijing Telecommunications Bureau's Third Bureau said: "The Soviet Union's transfer of Lushun, Dalian, and the Chinese Changchun Railway to us proves how much the Soviet Union respects China's sovereignty. It also proves how utterly shameless the American imperialists and their running dogs, the Kuomintang reactionaries, were in their rumors about the Lushun-Dalian issue. Today, the rumor-mongers have slapped themselves in the face!" Zhang Lianzhong of the Fourth Bureau said: "The Soviet Union's loan to us allows us to build many factories, gradually reducing unemployment. We workers really have to work hard." Wang Yulan, a female worker at the Beijing Garment Factory's Fourth Branch, said: "Things are really good now; we have a very good friend." Yuan Wanrong, a worker in the photogravure section of the China People's Printing Factory, said: "The signing of this historically significant treaty and agreements between China and the Soviet Union will shatter the rumors of those reactionary elements." Li Gui, a labor model at the Qinghe Woolen Mill, said: "The special agents spread rumors that World War III is about to break out, but with this Treaty of Friendship, Alliance, and Mutual Assistance, China and the Soviet Union united together have nothing to fear!" Li Defang, the chairman of the mill's trade union, said: "America gives Chiang Kai-shek guns to fight us, while the Soviet Union helps us build. The two camps in the world are extremely clear."

Yesterday (the 15th), branches and sub-branches of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association in various factories held meetings to report on the contents of the treaty and agreements. Workers expressed their thoughts and opinions on blackboard newspapers and in discussion sessions. To warmly celebrate this major event, various factories will hold evening parties, send out propaganda trucks, and form Yangge dance teams. Some factories are also preparing to launch a study of the treaty and agreement contents and the Xinhua News Agency editorial.

Workers in Various Factories Heartily Support, Hold Discussion Sessions and Gatherings to Celebrate

The Sino-Soviet Friendship Association branch and the trade union of the Beijing Telecommunications Bureau organized the staff and workers of various units to listen to the radio before 8:30 AM. Radios in various unit offices and worker dormitories were turned on. After listening, the Third Bureau immediately organized a record and rebroadcasted it through amplifiers. The staff and workers were extremely happy. Blackboard newspapers were put up in various units, and trade union groups were mobilized to conduct discussions. They believed that this was a concrete manifestation of the further development of friendship between China and the Soviet Union, and only the socialist Soviet Union would give us assistance. Let the imperialists and warmongers tremble! At 5:00 PM, the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association sub-branch and the trade union of the bureau jointly convened a meeting of all staff and workers to report on the contents and significance of the treaty and agreements. The Dongdan business office of the bureau held a celebration meeting at 7:00 PM.

The Sino-Soviet Friendship Association branches of the eleven units under the Beijing Garment Factory held reports separately at 5:00 PM. When the 400-plus staff and workers of the Xingsheng Hutong Fourth Branch listened to the report, they were extremely happy, and the shouts of slogans and cheers lasted for a long time.

After listening to the radio in the morning, the staff and workers of the China People's Printing Factory put up 120 blackboard newspapers throughout the factory, publishing a summary of the treaty's contents. From 6:00 PM to 8:30 PM, the person in charge of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association's general branch gave two reports, which were attended by over 5,000 workers.

More than 90 operations workers from the Shijingshan Power Plant held a discussion session at 4:00 PM. More than 300 other workers held a celebration meeting at 5:00 PM. When the workers heard that the Soviet Union was giving us loans and that the loan interest rate was only 1%, they applauded warmly.

The Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant held a celebration meeting at 5:00 PM, with the entire audience shouting, "Long live the friendship between the Chinese and Soviet peoples!" "Long live Chairman Mao!" "Long live Marshal Stalin!" Because the plant operates on a three-shift system, two more such meetings will be held today (the 16th).

The Waterworks Company used loudspeakers to report this matter to the entire company at 4:00 PM in the afternoon. Today, propaganda and celebration will be further expanded, with a discussion session held during the morning study time and a Yangge dance team sent to the streets to spread the word.

Many workers expressed their intention to guarantee the completion of this year's production plan to celebrate this event. The bureau will send a propaganda float to the streets for publicity today (the 16th) and will celebrate during the Spring Festival evening party.

Make Good Use of Loans, Strive to Improve Production

In addition to unanimously expressing warm support for the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, the workers of the Beijing Public Transportation Company were particularly excited about the loan agreement. They believed that this was an effective step to lift China out of poverty and backwardness. Comrades in the business section said: "How much is three hundred million US dollars in RMB! If you calculate it with a pen, several pieces of paper won't be enough! Where else in the world is there a 1% interest rate? Only a brotherly country can do that!" The repair factory workers believed that the Soviet Union's loan to us was to help us develop production and provide food for everyone. Building our new democratic new country." Deputy Director Hu suggested: "We must turn our joy into strength, celebrate it with practical actions of diligently learning technology, and repay the friendship of the Soviet Union with achievements in developing production and prospering the economy." All the workers unanimously responded to this.

Cao Yu, a worker at the Yongxing Foreign Paper Store in the Seventh District, said: "The Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance, and Mutual Assistance is the first major event of 1950. With this treaty, the Japanese invaders will never rise again! The American imperialists don't even think about coming to China to be emperors again! China's industrial construction prospects are even brighter!" Gao Leng, a worker at the Tiande Yong Grain Store in the Tenth District, said: "If any imperialist dares to invade us, we will definitely make them break their heads and shed blood!"

Last night, the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions convened 15 municipal trade union committee members from seven private industries, including printing, ironworking, flour, glassware, papermaking, automobile, and match industries, to discuss the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance, and Mutual Assistance and the two agreements in detail. Everyone spoke enthusiastically and unanimously believed that this was a concrete manifestation of the friendship between China and the Soviet Union. They will definitely convey it in detail to all members after returning.

Students Sing, Dance, Shout, and Parade on the Streets

Within three or four hours of receiving the news, students from Peking University and Hebei Higher Schools organized very long parades, singing, dancing, and shouting to their hearts' content and flooding the streets. Teachers, students, and staff staying at the Normal University gathered early in the morning in front of loudspeakers, listening intently to the school's broadcast of the news of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance, and Mutual Assistance, fearing to miss a single word. As soon as the broadcast ended, enthusiastic applause and cheers erupted like a storm. Gongs and drums were beaten, Yangge dances were performed, and big-character posters immediately appeared on the walls. Many people dressed up, made their own red and green flags, and wrote slogans such as "I fully agree with the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance!" and "Welcome to the new era of Sino-Soviet friendship!" while performing Yangge dances, expressing their infinite joy. After the news reached Tsinghua University, the teachers and students staying at the school were extremely excited, telling each other the good news. The 300 copies of the People's Daily, sold on behalf of the student union and containing the full text of the treaty, were immediately snapped up by the students. The Yangge dance team of the Department of Electrical Engineering immediately mobilized and performed on campus to celebrate. At 8:30 PM, 1,700 teachers and students held a grand "Celebration of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance, and Mutual Assistance Conference." Ye Qisun, the chairman of the school committee, said at the meeting: Since the founding of New China, the people of China and the people of the world have hoped for this day. After Chairman Mao and Premier Zhou went to Moscow, we have been looking forward to it. Today, seeing this day, I feel infinitely excited. Lin Shouping, the representative of the Tsinghua branch of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, said in his speech: This event is of great significance to the East and the entire world: one-third of the peace-loving people in the world have further united. Let the imperialists tremble before this treaty! Finally, he said excitedly: The signing of this treaty allows us to see the future of world peace and democracy; it also allows us to see the prospects for the construction of New China more clearly. Zhang Zigao and other representatives of the Tsinghua Educational Workers' Trade Union continued to speak, unanimously expressing their support for the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship and Alliance. The atmosphere at the meeting was extremely enthusiastic. After the meeting, recreational programs were performed to add to the fun. When the China University of Politics and Law held a celebration evening party on the 15th, more than 1,800 people attended. In the speeches of vice presidents Wu, Fan, Hu, and Cheng, and in the opinions of the students, they all believed that this treaty was the most sincere and selfless help from the Soviet Union to the Chinese people. More than 300 members of the Yanjing University Sino-Soviet Friendship Association branch held a special gathering on the evening of the 15th. The students believed that "this is a counterattack against warmongers!" "It shattered all the rumors about Sino-Soviet relations manufactured by the US and Chiang!" Student Wei Haoxun said: "This treaty is like a very good lesson in internationalism for us." They also planned to hold a special celebration meeting. As soon as the students of Yu Ying Middle School heard the broadcast, they sang the national anthems of China and the Soviet Union everywhere, hugged each other, and some people lifted others high up. Student Tang Yihua humorously said: "Let Acheson go and fabricate his 'reportedly' again!" Wang Jingtao said: "The imperialists should really cry." They sang loudly: "Great Soviet Union... Our Big Brother!" Some individual students at Municipal No. 4 Middle School had listened to various rumors fabricated by the US and Chiang, such as the so-called Soviet Union "invading" China. This time, they all frankly stated that they had been deceived in the past and misunderstood the Soviet Union. Now they feel enlightened, as if waking up from a dream.

Colorfully Decorated Broadcast Vehicles Attract Crowds, Vendors Voluntarily Set Off Firecrackers to Add to the Fun

On Chang'an Avenue, the People's Broadcasting Station's colorfully decorated broadcast vehicle attracted a large crowd, shouting "Long live Chairman Mao!" "Long live Stalin!" A vendor selling firecrackers voluntarily lit a string of firecrackers, crackling and popping to add to the fun.

After listening to the broadcast yesterday (the 15th) morning, various agencies in the capital were all excited and cheered. They adopted various ways to celebrate the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance, and Mutual Assistance.

Agencies and Organizations Hold Meetings to Celebrate, Yangge and Waist Drums Flood the Streets

The Beijing Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party held a symposium at noon. Comrade Peng Zhen reported on the significance of this treaty and the two agreements, saying: This is a worldwide issue, a major event in the world, a major event in China. With this treaty and two agreements, the victory of the Chinese revolution will be more consolidated. The people present enthusiastically shouted slogans such as "Thank you for the great and just assistance of the Soviet Union!" "Long live Chairman Mao!" "Long live Stalin!" etc. The Beijing Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party also moved the loudspeaker to the front door to rebroadcast the radio report to the outside world. Many passersby stopped to listen happily. The Beijing Municipal Committee also sent out a propaganda truck, hanging giant portraits of Comrade Stalin and Chairman Mao, to publicize the treaty and agreement contents on the streets, explaining the contents of the treaty and agreement to the masses when passing Tianqiao. The Beijing Municipal People's Government Office, the Tax Bureau, and the People's Court and other units listened to the broadcast while working yesterday, and the cadres were extremely excited after listening. The Beijing Municipal Democratic Women's Federation held a celebration evening party. Bright lights illuminated every happy smiling face, and their eyes were kindly fixed on the giant portraits of Stalin and Chairman Mao. In addition to Chairman Zhang Xiaomei reporting on the great significance of the treaty and agreement, many newly employed comrades said: "In the past, the reactionaries spread rumors that the Soviet Union moved away the machines in the Northeast and stationed troops in Lushun and Dalian. Today, the announcement of this treaty and agreement completely shattered the shameless slander of the reactionaries!" At about 4:00 PM yesterday, the China Youth Art Theater sent out three propaganda trucks, carrying a waist drum team, a Yangge team, and a music team of more than 120 people, to carry out publicity activities on the streets. When they arrived at the Soviet Embassy in Dongjiaomin Lane, the entire waist drum team started twisting and singing. The embassy officials cheered enthusiastically and shouted "Long live!" in Chinese. When the propaganda team arrived in front of the Central People's Government, they also shouted slogans in unison.

The Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, the Chinese Communist Party District Committee, the District Office, and the Trade Union Office of the Twelfth District held a symposium on the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance, and Mutual Assistance that evening. Everyone unanimously believed that the signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance, and Mutual Assistance swept away all the distorted propaganda of the US-Chiang bandit gang that slandered the relationship between China and the Soviet Union. Zhang Baoquan, a member of the Twelfth District Working Committee of the Communist Youth League, said: At this time, there are two different manifestations in the world: one is the cheers of the people all over the world; the other is the crying of the imperialists. Wei Keli, a cadre of the District Office, said: The great Soviet friendly country has put in a lot of effort for the emergence of a strong new China! But we cannot simply be grateful. We must use the loans given to us by the Soviet Union without wasting a single penny on production and construction.
