Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, February 5th: The Hong Kong British government's barbaric act of armed suppression of tram workers has continued to provoke strong protests from people across the country. The Northeast Federation of Trade Unions, the Northeast Women's Federation, the Northeast Student Federation, and several people's organizations in Shenyang have issued telegrams, protesting the Hong Kong government's brutality and extending cordial greetings to the injured workers and their families in Hong Kong. Ye Yucang, responsible person of the Nanjing branch of the China Democratic League, and Zhang Shiming, responsible person of the Nanjing branch of the Revolutionary Committee of the Kuomintang, successively issued statements, believing that the Hong Kong British military police's massacre of tram workers once again exposed the British government's pretense of recognizing our country to the Chinese people. More than 200,000 workers in Chongqing unanimously protested against the Hong Kong British government's bloody incident of infringing upon the freedom of assembly of Chinese workers, and believed that behind the Hong Kong worker brothers, there are the standing Chinese people and organized worker masses as backing, and they believe that the reasonable demands of the Hong Kong worker brothers will surely achieve final victory. The Shanxi Provincial Federation of Trade Unions and the Taiyuan Municipal Federation of Trade Unions said in their protest letter: We, the 500,000 workers in Shanxi Province, unanimously support the Hong Kong tram worker brothers. The preparatory committee of the Changsha Municipal Democratic Women's Federation and the Student Federation in Hunan Province unanimously demanded that the Hong Kong government punish the perpetrators and compensate for all losses of the trade union and the injured workers! In addition, trade unions in Baoding, Qingdao, Wuhu and other places, as well as people's organizations such as workers, women, and youth in Jiangxi, Henan, Hunan and other provinces, have successively sent telegrams, resolutely expressing their support for the just actions of the Hong Kong workers.

This Newspaper reports according to Xinhua News Agency dispatches: People in Tianjin, Wuhan, Hangzhou and other places have protested against the Hong Kong British government's massacre of Hong Kong tram workers, and unanimously expressed their firm support for the just actions of the Hong Kong worker brothers.

Huang Huoqing, Chairman of the Tianjin Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, said: We, all the workers in Tianjin, strongly protest the British military police's brutality and demand that the Hong Kong government immediately release the arrested tram workers, severely punish the perpetrators, unseal the tram workers' union hall, and compensate the union and the injured workers for all losses. He stated: Tianjin workers will definitely support the just actions of Hong Kong workers with the greatest strength. The Tianjin Railway District Trade Union, the Textile Industry Trade Union, and the Municipal Trade Union have also lodged strong protests with the Hong Kong British authorities. The employees of the Tianjin Tram Company also held a meeting, unanimously resolving to support the reasonable demands of the Hong Kong tram workers, and sending telegrams to support the Hong Kong workers and letters to express sympathy to the victimized workers. Employees of the Tianjin Branch of North China Electric Power Company, the French Power Company, the Post Office, and the No. 1 and No. 2 Factories of the Tianjin Paper Company also gathered on the 3rd and unanimously expressed their support.

The preparatory committee of the Central China and Wuhan Federation of Trade Unions also lodged a protest with the Hong Kong British government, expressing firm support for the persecuted compatriots in Hong Kong, and sending cordial condolences, demanding that the Hong Kong government severely punish the perpetrators, compensate the union and the injured workers for their losses, and ensure that similar incidents do not happen again in the future. The preparatory committee of the Wuhan Women's Federation, the Wuhan Municipal Working Committee of the New Democratic Youth League, and the Wuhan Municipal Student Federation have all issued statements, firmly protesting against the Hong Kong British government's brutality.

The first session of the Hangzhou Municipal Workers' Congress stated in its protest letter that it represents the 100,000 workers in the city and is willing to be the backing of the Hong Kong worker brothers, hoping that they will persevere in their struggle to the end.

Shenyang Northeast Daily, Hankou Yangtze River Daily, and Dagang Daily have all published commentaries, supporting the persecuted compatriots in Hong Kong and severely protesting against the Hong Kong British government's brutal acts.

Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, February 5th: Liu Fa, chairman of the Tram Workers' Union, and Zhi Zhan Yun, chief inspector, who were arrested in the bloody incident of armed suppression of workers by the British military police in Hong Kong on the evening of January 30 and were unreasonably escorted out of Hong Kong by the Hong Kong British government, have safely arrived in Guangzhou and were welcomed and comforted by the preparatory committee of the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions and other organizations. They issued a written statement on the blood case and the tram workers' strike, stating: The tram workers' request to improve their living standards was met with the Hong Kong British government's unwarranted persecution. They completely disregarded the human rights of workers and unreservedly favored the British-owned employers. After the employers closed the factory and stopped the trams, the tram workers repeatedly exercised restraint, from suggesting mediation to being willing to adopt consultative evaluation. Various sectors also called for the restoration of transportation, but the employers took this as a sign that they could be bullied and attempted to coerce the workers into submission through hunger. However, the tram workers were unmoved with the sympathy and support of the broad masses of workers and compatriots from all walks of life. The Hong Kong British government even wanted to stop people from sympathizing with the tram workers and created a bloody case. They should bear full responsibility for this incident. At present, tram workers should unite more closely, be calm and composed, and adhere to the reasonable demand to improve their living standards. We believe that our just actions will surely achieve final victory.
