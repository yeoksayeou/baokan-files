　　[Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 2nd] A TASS dispatch summarizes: The annual meeting of the Britain-Soviet Society, representing 645,000 members, unanimously passed a resolution to strengthen the society's work on the basis of a British-Soviet friendship policy in order to achieve the goal of striving for peace.
　　The annual meeting was held in London on January 28th, attended by 280 representatives from branches across the country, trade unions, and cooperative groups. In addition, representatives from friendship associations with the Soviet Union from France, Belgium, Switzerland, Australia, and New Zealand also attended the meeting.
　　The meeting was opened by Stanley Evans, Chairman of the Britain-Soviet Society. The meeting unanimously passed the main motion proposed by the Archbishop of Canterbury, Johnson. The motion stated: "The British people can only enjoy independence, peace, and improved living standards through strong friendship with the Soviet Union and greatly increased trade with the Soviet Union." The motion also stated: "Open war preparations against the Soviet Union, and the anti-Soviet propaganda movement carried out in Britain accompanying these preparations, have proven to be disastrous for the British people. Peace and friendship with the Soviet Union are in our vital interests. Therefore, the meeting calls on all people who desire peace to recognize the seriousness of the situation, to persist in friendship and trade with the Soviet Union, and to persist in disarmament and the prohibition of atomic bombs." In his speech, Johnson pointed out that the Soviet Union has consistently adhered to a policy of peace, and stated that the forces of peace, headed by the Soviet Union, have been greatly strengthened by the victory of the Chinese people.
　　Independent Labor Party member of parliament, Mills, said at the meeting that trade with the Soviet Union is inextricably linked to Britain's economic survival, and that the United States is attempting to economically strangle Britain. Britain can only survive by abandoning its current disastrous policies.
　　Equipment industry worker, Jenkins, said: British trade union members will refuse to participate in the anti-Soviet war planned by the imperialists. Amidst applause, he added: "Tell the government that if they dare to launch another terrible war, then they must know what the consequences will be."
　　The meeting also passed a motion to expand the membership drive. Association Secretary, Walter, declared: "Despite the slanderous campaigns against the Soviet Union and the various difficulties facing the association, the number of members is now greater than ever before." The association currently has 114 group members, 32 more than in 1948, and 7,300 individual members, an increase of 60 percent. Walter also stated: The association's task in the upcoming parliamentary elections is to make every candidate aware of the necessity of British-Soviet friendship.
　　The meeting also unanimously passed a resolution to change the name of the association from "Britain-Soviet Society" to "British-Soviet Friendship Society". The meeting elected independent Labor Party member of parliament, Mills, as Chairman of the association, and the Archbishop of Canterbury, Johnson, was re-elected as President.

　　英苏协会年会决议
    坚持英苏友好
    协会改名英苏友好协会
    【新华社北京二日电】综合塔斯社消息：代表六十四万五千会员的英苏协会年会一致通过决议，以英苏友好政策为基础，加强协会工作，以达到争取和平的目的。
    年会于一月二十八日在伦敦举行，到会者有全国各地分会、职工会及合作社团体的代表二百八十人。此外，出席会议的还有法、比、瑞士、澳大利亚及新西兰等国对苏友好协会的代表。
    会议由英苏协会主席斯坦莱·伊凡斯主持开幕。会议一致通过坎特伯雷大主教约翰逊提出的主要议案。该议案称：“英国人民只有通过与苏联的坚固友谊及大大增加与苏联的贸易，才能享受到独立、和平及提高生活标准。”该议案又称：“公开针对苏联的战争准备，以及伴随着这种准备工作而在英国进行的反苏宣传运动，业已证明对英国人民是灾难性的。和平及对苏友好是我们的切身利益。因此，会议号召一切希望和平的人们认识局势的严重性，坚持与苏联友好及贸易，坚持裁减军备和禁止原子弹。”约翰逊在演说中指出，苏联一贯坚持和平政策，并称，以苏联为首的和平力量，已因中国人民的胜利而大大加强。
    独立的工党议员米尔斯在会上演说称，与苏联贸易是与英国的经济生存息息相关的，美国正企图在经济上绞杀英国，英国只有放弃目前的灾难性的政策，才能生存下去。
    装置业工人仁金斯说：英国的工会会员，将拒绝参加帝国主义者所策划的反苏战争。他在掌声中又说：“告诉政府，如果他们敢于再度发动可怕的战争，那末，他们必须知道会得到什么后果。”
    会议又通过扩大征收会员运动案。提案人协会书记华莱特宣称：“尽管有诽谤苏联的运动及协会面前的种种困难，现在，会员人数却较以前任何时候为多。”协会现有团体会员一百一十四个，较一九四八年多三十二个，个人会员七千三百人，增加了百分之六十。华莱特又称：协会在即将到来的议会选举中的任务，是使每一个候选人认识英苏友好之必要。
    会议并一致通过决议，将协会的名称由“英苏协会”改为“英苏友好协会”。会议选出独立的工党议员米尔斯为协会主席，坎特伯雷大主教约翰逊连任会长。
