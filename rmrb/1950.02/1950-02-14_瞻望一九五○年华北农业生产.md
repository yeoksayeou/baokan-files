　　Looking Forward to North China's Agricultural Production in 1950
    Zhang Linchi
    After eight years of the War of Resistance against Japan and three years of the War of Liberation, the rural areas of North China suffered from the enemy's burning, killing, looting, and destruction, resulting in a sharp decline in production levels. By 1943, agricultural production in the old liberated areas had generally decreased by more than half compared to before the War of Resistance. After 1944, production levels gradually recovered because, based on the rent reduction movement, the policy of organizing as advocated by Chairman Mao was implemented. Villages with good production work have now recovered to pre-war levels. However, such areas are still a minority in the whole of North China. According to a survey in 1948, livestock decreased by 40% to 50% compared to pre-war levels, farm tools were lost by 10% to 40%, fertilizer was greatly reduced, and farming was extensive. The overall average production level was still 21.5% lower than before the war. After the production movement in 1949, the old areas were still about 10% lower than before the war, while the new areas were still about 20% lower.

    In 1949, it was proposed to increase grain production by five sheng per mu, plant 13 million mu of cotton, and plant 5 million mu of peanuts. Although it suffered from serious floods, droughts, and insect plagues, with the strong leadership of the government and the concerted efforts of all farmers, grain production reached about 26 billion jin. Calculated on the same year's output, it was higher than in 1948. In terms of increasing industrial raw materials and export goods, 14.43 million mu of cotton were planted (including southwestern Shanxi), producing about 330 million jin of ginned cotton. 5.27 million mu of peanuts were planted, yielding 1.1 billion jin.

    We stated from the beginning that increasing production depends on human effort and the possible application of science and technology, not on nature's bounty. According to a survey of 115 typical villages, plowing in the old areas increased by 7% in 1949 compared to 1948. Including the new areas, it was 3.9%. Harrowing increased by 3.33% compared to 1948. Autumn plowing in 1949 reached over 85%, an increase of 11% compared to the previous year, and weeding and inter-tillage exceeded pre-war levels. According to a survey of 140 typical villages, cotton planting in 1949 exceeded the previous year by 50%, corn by 20.3%, potatoes by 19.1%, and sweet potatoes by 12.4%. Wheat, millet, and sorghum all exceeded 5%. Regarding fertilization, the original requirement was to increase by 15% to 20% on the basis of 1948. According to a survey of 127 typical villages: native fertilizer has increased by 28%; refined fertilizer (including oil cake, dried manure, etc.) has increased by 45%; sheep bedding has increased by 59.7%; and bare land has decreased by 14.7%. From this examination, our production level has indeed been improved by human effort.

    According to surveys and reports, Wuxiang County in Shanxi Province increased production by 1.3 dou per mu, and Xiangyuan County increased production by an average of 1.16 dou per mu. The average production level in the old areas (a typical survey of 70 villages) has recovered to about 90% of pre-war levels; the new areas have reached about 80%. In a survey of eleven villages in Changzhi Prefecture, Shanxi Province, eight villages have exceeded pre-war levels. In Mancheng County, Hebei Province, more than ten villages have exceeded pre-war levels. 118 villages in the Fifth District of Xincheng have reached pre-war levels. Why is it that under the conditions of massive losses of livestock and farm tools caused by the enemy's destruction, production levels can be increased so quickly? This is due to the implementation of Chairman Mao's policy of organization, using all forces to overcome difficulties, waging a tenacious struggle against severe natural disasters, and carrying out some technical improvement work. When the spring sowing season of 1949 arrived, the entire North China region was experiencing a severe drought. However, under the instruction of the North China People's Government on combating drought and preparing for famine, governments at all levels and the vast number of farmers immediately mobilized and plunged into a vigorous drought-resistant and planting movement. In drought-resistant planting, central Hebei mobilized 14,000 cadres to leave production, and southern Hebei mobilized 4,000 people, organizing work teams to go deep into the countryside, mobilize the masses, and break the farmers' passive mentality of relying on the heavens for rain. 80% of the labor force in the Tenth District of central Hebei participated in planting, and 90% of households participated in planting. In Xingtai, 81% of households in ten districts carried water for planting. When a serious insect plague occurred, the masses were organized to catch and kill the insects, and pesticides were used to spray them. For example, after locusts occurred in Taihang, a continuous and resolute struggle was carried out under the slogan of "Protecting seedlings is like protecting lives," eradicating the locusts each time they appeared. In Anyang alone, 51 districts and towns mobilized 2 million laborers to eliminate locusts on 1.43 million mu of land. After July, there were continuous heavy rains, and the government led the masses to build embankments and block breaches. However, due to the excessive concentration of rainfall and the excessive river flow, more than 30 million mu of land were flooded. The government again organized the masses to fight against the flood and plant wheat after drainage. During the autumn harvest campaign, more women poured into the autumn harvest and implemented seed selection and soaking. Male laborers and livestock were freed up to carry out autumn plowing and wheat planting, so wheat planting in various places exceeded the plan, and autumn plowing reached about 85%. Although livestock was lacking, the organized manpower could replace animal power. For example, the county magistrate of Yangyuan County in Chahar Province and the county magistrate of Xuanhua County personally led farmers to pull plows and dig the ground, thus influencing 150,000 people in southern Chahar to organize people to pull plows and dig the ground, breaking the habit of not being able to cultivate the land without livestock. In a series of production struggles, the greatness of the power of the masses organized under the leadership of the Communist Party and the People's Government has been fully demonstrated. And under such severe disasters and difficulties in 1949, the production level still increased by about 10%. This proves that in 1950, with greater efforts and further promotion of this spirit and this practice, we will certainly be able to restore the old areas to pre-war production levels, the new areas will approach pre-war production levels, and we will strive to restore pre-war levels in 1951.

    The national agricultural production conference assigned North China the task of increasing grain production by 2.5 billion jin in 1950 (excluding the number of losses reduced by floods), and increasing ginned cotton production by 170 million jin (planting 18 million mu of cotton, producing 500 million jin of ginned cotton). On the basis of the development in 1949, fully utilize the organized forces, launch mass technical extension movements, and use urban industrial and transportation assistance to ensure the completion of this task. There are now considerable conditions: First, the organization of mutual aid in production reached more than half of the labor force in 1949, with some reaching 70% to 80%. The participation of women in the old areas reached 50% to 70%. In 1950, not only will there be a great development in quantity, but also labor efficiency and technology will be greatly improved. In this way, it is possible to reach or even exceed pre-war levels of cultivation.

    Second, breeding livestock. According to a survey of 270 villages, the breeding rate reached 9.85%, with the lowest being 8%. A total of 420,000 heads of livestock were bred in 1949, accounting for about 11% of the total number of 3.6 million heads of livestock (including purchased livestock). In 1950, calculated at a breeding rate of 8.6%, 470,000 heads can be bred. 560,000 heads were vaccinated in 1949, and it is possible to carry out planned vaccinations on 2 million heads in 1950.

    Third, prevent floods and build water conservancy projects. We have always attached importance to this work. 2.26 million mu of paddy fields were added in 1949. Reducing flood damage by 20 million mu in 1950 can increase grain production by 1 billion jin. Adding 4.4 million mu of paddy fields can increase grain production by 240 million jin. Specific plans have now been surveyed and formulated, and as long as the organization work is done well, it can definitely be completed.

    Fourth, increase fertilizer application. In 1949, it generally exceeded the previous year by 15%. In winter, various places launched a manure accumulation and fertilizer piling campaign, and it is not a problem to increase it by another 15% to 20% in 1950. That is to say, it is possible to reach or approach pre-war levels in fertilization.

    Fifth, prevent and control insect and animal pests. In 1949, the area affected by insect pests in the entire region reached 11.68 million mu. After organizing the masses to catch insects and using pesticides to spray them, 7.45 million mu of crops were saved. Based on the experience of 1949, organizing the masses and adopting scientific pesticides to prevent and control insect and animal pests in 1950 can protect 30 million mu of crops from insect pests.

    Sixth, promote improved varieties. In 1949, the original plan was to promote improved varieties on 380,000 mu, and the actual promotion area reached 500,000 mu. And in the summer and autumn seasons, large-scale seed selection campaigns were organized. The entire region selected about 30 million jin of improved varieties of edible crops and 20 million jin of improved cotton seeds. The masses selected 25 million jin of seeds locally, according to statistical figures. A total of 10 million mu of improved varieties can be promoted in 1950.

    Seventh, due to the availability of a large amount of coal, iron, and machinery, not only can the farm tools currently used by farmers be repaired and manufactured, but also a large number of new horse-drawn farm tools can be manufactured, and fuel can be solved to increase fertilizer.

    Eighth, planting trees and afforestation. Farmers deeply know the benefits of planting trees and afforestation. In 1949, the necessary and possible organizational work was carried out, and the village established a forest protection convention. And 68.5 million trees have been planted, and 1,608 mu of nurseries have been established. The number will definitely exceed this number greatly in 1950.

    Ninth, due to the cessation of war service, labor efficiency has been improved. Many places can re-cultivate the land that was abandoned during the war. The plan for 1950 is to complete the reclamation of 5.5 million mu, which can increase grain production by 300 million jin.

    Tenth, after the implementation of labor mutual aid, labor is saved, which is more conducive to the development of sideline occupations and the combination of agriculture and sideline occupations. In 1949, with the needs of cities and exports, the recovery and development of animal husbandry and sideline occupations were further stimulated. Compared with the previous year, pigs increased by 22.15%, and some areas exceeded pre-war levels by 14.3%. Sheep increased by 30%, and chickens increased by 40%. Other products such as mountain goods, medicinal materials, reed mats, and straw braids have expanded their sales channels, which has also increased prices (of course, some sideline occupations are still in the process of restructuring). In 1950, animal husbandry and sideline occupations will be further restored and developed, and the increase in pigs and chickens will exceed pre-war numbers. This will not only increase agricultural income, but also promote and support the rapid recovery of agriculture.

    North China's agricultural production in 1949 was carried out under the new situation of war victory, the liberation of the entire territory, the basic completion of land reform, and the presence of modern industry and transportation in large cities. These are unprecedentedly favorable conditions. And these conditions will have further development in 1950, which is a greater guarantee for the completion of the task of increasing production.

　　瞻望一九五○年华北农业生产
    张林池
    华北的农村经过八年抗战与三年的解放战争，遭受了敌寇的烧杀抢掠，摧残破坏，生产水平严重下降。到一九四三年，老解放区农业生产一般较抗战前下降一半以上。一九四四年后因为在减租运动的基础上，执行了毛主席组织起来的方针，生产水平才逐渐恢复。生产工作好的村庄现在已恢复了战前水平。但这样的地区在全华北说来还是少数的。根据一九四八年调查，牲口较战前减少百分之四十至五十，农具损失百分之十至四十，肥料大减，耕作粗放。总平均生产水平较战前尚低百分之二十一点五。经过一九四九年的生产运动，老区较战前尚低百分之十左右，新区则尚低百分之二十左右。
    一九四九年提出了每亩增产粮食五升，植棉一千三百万亩，种花生五百万亩。虽然遭受了严重的水灾、旱灾、虫灾，但在政府大力领导，全体农民一致努力下，产粮约达二百六十亿斤。按同一年成计算，较一九四八年提高了。在增产工业原料及出口物资方面，完成种植棉花一千四百四十三万亩（晋西南在内），约产皮棉三亿三千万斤。种花生五百二十七万亩，可产十一亿斤。
    我们一开始就说明，增产是要依靠人为力量与可能运用的科学技术，并非依靠天年。据一百一十五个典型村调查，一九四九年老区耕犁较一九四八年增多百分之七。包括新区则为百分之三点九。耙较一九四八年增多百分之三点三三。一九四九年秋耕地达百分之八十五以上，即较前一年增加百分之十一，除草中耕已超过战前水平。据一百四十个典型村调查，棉花种植，一九四九年超过前一年百分之五十，玉蜀黍超过百分之二十点三，马铃薯超过百分之十九点一，甘薯超过百分之十二点四，小麦、谷子、高粱均超过百分之五以上。在施肥上原要求在一九四八年的基础上增加百分之十五至二十，据一百二十七个典型村调查：土粪已增百分之二十八；细肥（包括油饼、大粪干等）增百分之四十五；羊卧地增加百分之五十九点七；白地减少百分之十四点七。由此检查我们的生产水平，确是由人为的努力提高的。
    根据调查及报告，山西武乡县每亩增产一点三斗，襄垣全县平均每亩增产一点一六斗。老区平均生产水平（七十个村的典型调查）已恢复到战前的百分之九十左右；新区已达百分之八十左右。而山西长治专区十一个村调查中，已有八个村超过战前水平。河北省满城有十个村以上超过战前水平。新城五区一百十八个村已达战前水平。为什么由敌寇的摧残破坏使牲口农具的大量损失情况下，能够这样快的提高生产水平呢？这是由于实行毛主席组织起来的方针，用一切力量，战胜困难，向严重天灾作顽强的斗争，并进行了一些技术改良工作的结果。当一九四九年春季播种时节，华北全区呈严重旱象，但在华北人民政府抗旱备荒的指示下，各级政府与广大农民立即动员起来，卷入轰轰烈烈的抗旱抢种运动。在抗旱点种中，冀中即动员脱离生产干部一万四千人，冀南区动员四千人，组织工作队深入农村，发动群众，打破了农民靠天等雨的消极思想。冀中十分区参加点种的劳力达百分之八十，参加点种的户达百分之九十。邢台十个区有百分之八十一的户担水点种。发生了严重的虫害，即组织群众捕打，用药剂喷杀。如太行发生蝗虫后，即在“保苗如保命”的口号下进行了连续的坚毅的斗争，出一次灭一次。只安阳五十一个区镇，即动员了二百万劳力消灭了一百四十三万亩地的蝗虫。七月后又连日大雨，政府领导群众筑堤堵口。但由于雨水过于集中，河水流量太大，因而淹地三千余万亩。政府又组织了群众与水灾作斗争，进行排水种麦。在三秋运动中，更多的妇女涌入秋收，并实行选种浸种。腾出男劳力与牲口力，进行秋耕种麦，因而各地种麦超过计划，秋耕达百分之八十五左右。牲口虽然缺乏，但可以用组织起来的人力代替畜力。如察省阳原县县长及宣化县长等亲自带农民拉犁刨地，因而影响察南十五万人组织人拉犁刨地，打破了没有牲口就不能耕地的习惯。在一连串的生产斗争中，充分证明了广大群众在共产党及人民政府领导下组织起来力量的伟大。而在一九四九年这样严重的灾害与困难下，生产水平还提高了一成左右。由此证明一九五○年我们以更大的努力更加发扬这种精神，这种作法，一定可以在老区恢复到战前的生产水平，新区接近战前的生产水平，并争取在一九五一年恢复战前水平。
    全国农业生产会议所给与华北区一九五○年的生产任务是增产粮食二十五亿斤（不包括水灾减少损失数），增产皮棉一亿七千万斤（植棉一千八百万亩，共产皮棉五亿斤）。在一九四九年的发展基础上，充分发挥组织起来的力量，展开群众性的技术推广运动，运用城市工业与交通的援助，保证这个任务的完成。目前已经具备了相当条件：第一生产互助的组织，一九四九年已达劳力的一半以上，多者达百分之七、八十，老区妇女参加生产的已达百分之五十至七十，一九五○年不但在数量上会有很大的发展，劳动效率与技术也将大大提高。这样，耕作水平达到甚至超过战前水平是可能的。
    第二繁殖耕畜，据二百七十个村的调查，繁殖率达百分之九点八五，低的也有百分之八，一九四九年共增殖耕畜四十二万头，约合总耕畜数三百六十万头的百分之十一（连购买的在内）。一九五○年按增殖率百分之八点六计，可增殖四十七万头。一九四九年曾防疫注射五十六万头，一九五○年有计划的进行注射二百万头，是可以作到的。
    第三防止水患，兴修水利。这项工作我们一向是重视的。一九四九年增水田二百二十六万亩。一九五○年减少水害二千万亩，即可增产粮食十亿斤。增加水田四百四十万亩，可增产粮食二亿四千万斤。现已勘测拟定了具体计划，只要组织工作作好，一定可以完成。
    第四增施肥料，一九四九年一般已超过前一年的百分之十五。冬季，各地又开展积肥比粪堆运动，一九五○年再提高百分之十五至二十当无问题。也就是说，在施肥上是能够达到或接近战前水平的。
    第五防除虫害兽害。一九四九年全区发生虫害面积达一千一百六十八万亩，经组织群众捕虫及用药剂喷射后，救治了庄稼七百四十五万亩。根据一九四九年的经验，一九五○年组织群众与采用科学药剂防除虫害兽害可保三千万亩庄稼不受虫害。
    第六推广优良品种。一九四九年原计划推广优良品种三十八万亩，实际推广面积达五十万亩。且在夏秋两季组织了大规模的选种运动，全区选得食用作物优良品种约三千万斤，优良棉种二千万斤，群众就地选种已有统计数字的为二千五百万斤。一九五○年共计可推广优良品种一千万亩。
    第七由于有了大量的煤、铁、机器，不但可以修理与制造农民现在使用的农具，还可以大量制造新的马拉农具，并可解决燃料增加肥料。
    第八植树造林。农民深深知道植树造林的好处。一九四九年，已进行必要与可能的组织工作，由村建立护林公约。并已植树六千八百五十万株，建立了苗圃一千六百零八亩。一九五○年必将大大超过这个数目。
    第九由于战勤的停止，提高了劳动效率。很多地方可以把战争时荒了的土地重新垦种。一九五○年计划完成开荒五百五十万亩，可增产粮食三亿斤。
    第十实行劳动互助后，节省了劳力，更便于副业的发展，进行农副结合。一九四九年有了城市与出口的需要，更刺激畜养与副业的恢复与发展。较前一年猪增加百分之二十二点一五，有的地区超过战前百分之十四点三。羊增加百分之三十，鸡增加百分之四十。其他如山货药材、苇席、草帽辫等，扩大了销路，也就提高了价格（当然还有些副业是处在改组过程中）。一九五○年畜养与副业将要更进一步的恢复与发展，而猪、鸡的增加会超过战前的数目，这样不仅增加农业的收益，而且将促进与支持农业的迅速恢复。
    一九四九年华北农业生产是处在战争胜利，全境解放，土地改革基本完成，有了大城市近代化的工业与交通的新形势下进行的。这是空前的有利条件。而这些条件，在一九五○年会有更进一步的发展，这就是对于增产的任务的完成有了更大的保障。
