Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, 17th—The Southwest Military and Political Committee, the Chongqing Military Control Commission, and the Chongqing Municipal People's Government held a grand cocktail party on the evening of the 16th to celebrate the signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance, and Mutual Assistance and two other agreements of great significance. Over 500 representatives from all walks of life and various democratic parties were invited to attend, as well as the Soviet industrial experts, Manisev and two others, who were recently hired to work in Chongqing. Chairman Liu Bocheng, Mayor Chen Xilian, Chu Tunan representing the Democratic League, Hu Zi'ang representing the industrial and commercial sectors, Ai Wu representing the literary and art circles, Soviet friend Manisev, and representatives of workers, women, and students delivered enthusiastic congratulatory speeches in succession. Chairman Liu Bocheng's speech stated in brief: The signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance, and Mutual Assistance demonstrates that the peace-loving people of China and the Soviet Union, after paying the price of blood in their joint struggle against fascist Japanese imperialism, and learning from painful experience, have expressed their common determination to prevent aggression and to prevent the resurgence of American imperialism in supporting Japanese imperialist aggression forces, thereby consolidating the cause of peace in the East and the world. For the people of our country, who have just won the revolution and are working hard to restore the country's economic construction, this treaty and agreement will give us unlimited assistance in all aspects. Faced with such a favorable situation and conditions, how should we, the people of the Southwest, celebrate, consolidate, and develop this great historical friendship that is celebrated throughout the country? We must continue to work hard to eliminate all remaining bandits and special agents, maintain social order in urban and rural areas, stabilize the people's lives, establish a solid national defense, protect the country's independence and peaceful construction, and consolidate permanent Sino-Soviet cooperation and mutual assistance in order to safeguard world peace. We must rapidly develop urban and rural production, and make good use of the friendly, enthusiastic, and preferential economic assistance provided to us by the Soviet Union, and consolidate the economic cooperation between China and the Soviet Union, in order to accelerate our construction of a prosperous and industrialized country. Our cultural and educational workers must educate the people about the essence of the sincere friendship and mutual assistance between the people of China and the Soviet Union from the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance, and Mutual Assistance and the agreements. They should obtain powerful weapons to criticize the prejudices of narrow nationalists and the illusions of those who harbor illusions about imperialist and capitalist countries. Finally, we must strengthen the great unity of the revolutionary people a hundredfold, that is, strengthen the great unity of the revolutionary people of China and the great unity of the international people headed by the Soviet Union.
