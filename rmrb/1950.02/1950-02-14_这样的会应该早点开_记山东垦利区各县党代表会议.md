    Records of Party Representative Conferences in Various Counties of Kenli District, Shandong
    Li Jianhua
    In order to promote intra-Party democracy, strengthen ties between the Party and the masses, and do a good job in production and disaster relief, the counties in the Kenli area of Shandong Province successively convened Party representative conferences from early December to mid-December last year. A total of 1,348 official representatives attended, and 141 non-Party masses were invited, mainly model workers and activists in various fields, such as production models, Yellow River management heroes, and model military dependents; another 55 people (mainly cadres from relevant agencies) attended as observers. In general, the Party representative conferences in various counties achieved the goals of promoting democracy, carrying out criticism and self-criticism, and examining leadership and discussing work.
    Before the meetings, all counties made full preparations. When electing representatives, the qualifications for representatives were stipulated, such as having a firm stance, a correct work style, being active in production work, having close ties with the masses, being trusted by the masses, and being selfless, not corrupt, and not wasteful. At the same time, in-depth mobilization and deliberation were carried out, and general meetings of Party members in villages and townships were held. In addition to explaining the qualifications of representatives, the nature of the Party Congress and the rights and obligations of Party members were emphasized. Some counties (such as Bin County) even gave two Party lectures to improve Party members' understanding.
    At the beginning of the meeting, after explaining the significance, tasks, and requirements of the Party Congress and focusing the representatives' thinking, the county party committee reported to the congress on its work and put forward the work guidelines for the future. Then, group discussions were held to review the county party committee's report, examine the leadership, and stimulate the spirit of democracy. Then, a general meeting was held to launch discussions and adopt resolutions. The same procedure was followed when discussing future tasks and formulating resolutions. After the meeting, district cadres were retained to discuss ways to implement the resolutions of the Party Representative Conference.
    Therefore, the meeting was very fruitful:
    Promoting Democracy, Raising Party Members' Awareness, and Examining the Leadership of the County Party Committee
    A. Democracy was truly promoted, the leadership of the County Party Committee was examined, which not only improved the awareness of the representatives present but also improved the ideological level of the leaders. Due to sufficient democratic education, individual consultations, cultivation of core members, and the leadership's expression of their attitude, Party members' awareness was improved to an unprecedented extent and criticism and self-criticism were carried out. For example, at the Kenli Party Congress, sharp criticism was made of the Songjiaquan breach. Some representatives said: "The No. 1 dam head in Zuojiazhuang was so dangerous and did not breach, but Songjiaquan breached when the work was flat. This is because the County Party Committee leadership lacked a mass viewpoint and lacked preparation in advance." Many opinions were raised on the shortcomings and errors in Yellow River management, as well as the bad behavior of cadres, such as embezzling the fruits of labor and beating and scolding the masses. For example, Putai not only examined the overall leadership of the County Party Committee but also criticized the work style of individual County Party Committee comrades. The speeches were extremely enthusiastic, accounting for more than 40% of the speeches at the conference. For example, when Wudi reviewed the work report of the County Party Committee, some representatives pointed out: "Some of the work reports of the County Party Committee are not realistic, and the self-criticism is not sincere." Some counties were criticized for not basing the County Party Committee's work arrangements on the specific situation, being tight at the beginning and slack at the end, inconsistent leadership, and untimely resolution of problems. For example, Bin County criticized the bureaucracy of the County Party Committee: unclear rewards and punishments for cadres, long-term lack of education for rural branches, lack of understanding of the situation at the lower levels, and failure to solve problems when they were discovered. According to incomplete statistics, Yangxin raised 93 opinions in reviewing the County Party Committee's report, such as the leadership of drought resistance, flood prevention, and substitute farming work, bureaucracy, listening to good news but not bad news, etc., which were seriously criticized, greatly improving the democratic enthusiasm of the representatives present. Due to the promotion of democracy and the examination of leadership, many County Party Committees realized the shortcomings and errors in their leadership and work, and at the same time changed some wrong ideas that they did not believe in the masses and thought they could not put forward any opinions. For example, the Lijin County Party Committee mentioned in its summary of the Party Congress: "This Party Representative Conference gave our County Party Committee a very practical and vivid lesson. It educated the County Party Committee, helped the County Party Committee recognize its mistakes, enhanced the concept of the masses, and improved everyone's awareness." Some representatives also said: "If this kind of meeting had been held earlier, these mistakes would not have occurred. It would be good to hold this kind of meeting more often!"
    Discussing Production and Disaster Relief Work, Overcoming the Simple Task Viewpoint
    B. The resolution on winter production and disaster relief work was discussed and adopted. The Party's leadership was initially implemented, and the simple task viewpoint of receiving and delivering tasks was overcome. When discussing and formulating work resolutions, the counties not only started from the demands of the masses but also seriously explained and adopted them word by word. If there were any omissions or problems that were not included, the representatives would raise them for supplementation, with a very serious attitude. For example, when Huimin discussed future work, the representatives put forward five points based on the reflections and opinions of the masses: (1) requiring the issuance of land licenses; (2) uneven land grades and unreasonable distribution; (3) correct handling of marriage problems; (4) solving the sales of sideline businesses; (5) opening primary schools and winter schools. For example, when Wudi passed the resolution, several points were missed, which were supplemented by the representatives, namely: "Protecting wheat seedlings and prohibiting livestock from grazing on wheat fields" and "Combining the handling of accumulated fruits in production and disaster relief." At the same time, when discussing and passing resolutions, debates were launched on different opinions and incorrect opinions. For example, the representative of Pucheng Township in Putai said: "I investigated seven disaster victims who had no clothes and food, and the County Party Committee and District Committee did not solve their problems." Other representatives said: "You investigated, so why didn't you mobilize the masses to produce for self-salvation?" For example, when Huimin discussed future work, some representatives said: "These women have improved, and there are more divorces." This was immediately criticized and corrected by other representatives. Some representatives put forward the leading role of digging ditches and draining water this year, explaining that production and disaster relief cannot be done without leadership. The representative of Huimin said: "If others don't do it, we will do it first. The production we thought in the past did not need leadership because we had no leadership!" In particular, the policy of production and disaster relief and specific issues such as "guaranteeing that no one will freeze to death," "guaranteeing that no one will starve to death," "guaranteeing that the families of martyrs and disabled soldiers will not beg for food," and "guaranteeing that there will be no sale of children" were discussed in detail. The representatives present attached great importance to these resolutions. Some were afraid that they would not remember them and would not be able to explain them when they returned, so they asked people to copy the resolutions. Everyone unanimously reflected: "Our opinions have been written down, we have exercised the rights of Party members, and we cannot forget the obligations of Party members!" "This resolution was made by everyone, and we should resolutely implement it when we return." Some said: "I wasn't active in the past because I couldn't explain it clearly, but now I understand, and I should work hard!"
    Initially Connecting with the Masses and Laying the Foundation for an Open Party
    C. The masses were initially contacted, laying the foundation for an open Party. Because all counties except Yangxin invited non-Party masses to participate in this Party Congress and solicited their opinions on all aspects, the masses who attended the meeting felt that the Communist Party was truly selfless. Some of the masses who attended the meeting said: "Look, what is not for the sake of the common people? The Communist Party truly serves the masses. As long as the Communist Party wants me, I will resolutely ask to join the Communist Party." Some said: "This kind of meeting should have been held earlier. If it had been held a few years earlier, the village would have had Party members, and less mistakes could have been made in the work, and it would have been done better than it is now." Therefore, the political influence of the Party was greatly expanded, and some of the estrangement between the Party and the masses was initially eliminated. In the discussion and formulation of work resolutions, the issue of opening the Party was also emphasized, which caused a lot of concern among the representatives present, such as saying: "The Party is going to be open, is this because the higher authorities don't want us anymore?" "Good ones can be open, but bad ones can be temporarily kept secret." "If Party members are open, it will be difficult to handle things in the future." The county party committee leadership immediately conducted repeated education, repeatedly explaining the significance and purpose of opening the Party, so that most of the Party member representatives present could break down their concerns and stabilize their emotions. This laid a good ideological foundation for the issue of opening branches.
    D. Through the actual actions of the Party Congress, Party members were educated, enabling them to understand the basic knowledge of the Party and the Party's organizational principles, and improving their awareness. Because in the process of the meeting, the leadership of the County Party Committee was examined and criticism was carried out; in the discussion and adoption of work resolutions, debates were launched, so that the representatives present truly felt the democratic spirit within the Party. In particular, raising hands to vote showed that the minority obeyed the majority; the resolutions passed by all the representatives and approved by the higher authorities showed that the lower level obeyed the higher level; serious criticism was made of the County Party Committee, and full discussion was held on future work, showing the rights of Party members. The resolutions passed by everyone and approved by the higher authorities must be resolutely implemented by Party members, explaining the Party's democratic centralism, the rights and obligations of Party members, etc. These education sessions were much more effective than the previous Party lectures.
    However, the meeting still had its shortcomings:
    Shortcomings of the Meeting: Insufficient Understanding Before the Meeting, Insufficient Preparation
    A. Insufficient understanding of the Party Congress and insufficient attention. Some believed that the Party Congress was not as effective as the cadre meeting in solving problems, and there was a task viewpoint, believing that the meeting was a formality. Therefore, the attitude was not serious enough, and there was a lack of full deliberation and education. Some representatives had a vague understanding of the Party Congress and had concerns, such as: "I don't know what this meeting is about again," etc. Therefore, it also proved that there was a lack of full mobilization and deliberation in advance. Furthermore, due to insufficient democratic education in advance, some representatives had concerns when making suggestions, such as: "Will there be retaliation? Will I be given a hard time?" "It's better to say less than to say more," "Offending people is embarrassing," etc. Although these suspicions were broken in the actual actions of the meeting; it also added a lot of trouble to the meeting and dragged out the time.
    B. Poor preparation in advance. Some selected representatives very carelessly, and some invited non-Party masses to participate without a serious attitude, which caused some mass representatives to have doubts and illusions, and they did not express their opinions when they attended the meeting.
    C. When reviewing the County Party Committee's report and examining the County Party Committee's leadership, the speeches were subject to time constraints, and some representatives' opinions were not fully expressed.
    D. Some of the opinions on future work were raised too much, and they were read very quickly when they were passed, and there was a lack of specific explanations; some were raised very briefly, making the representatives present feel that "there are too many," "very general," "unclear," and unable to accept them, making it difficult to implement them when they returned.
    E. In terms of meeting content, some counties were too disorganized and did not focus on solving several main problems. At the same time, when discussing work, many problems were raised, but few solutions were offered, making the representatives feel that they had nowhere to start.
    F. Many opinions were raised at the meeting, but few debates were launched. Some problems lacked a conclusion, and they could not better clarify right and wrong and improve understanding.

　　“这样的会应该早点开”
    记山东垦利区各县党代表会议
    李健华
    为了发扬党内民主，密切党群关系，做好生产救灾工作，山东垦利地区各县于去年十二月初至十二月中旬先后召开了党代表会议。到会正式代表一千三百四十八人，并邀请非党群众一百四十一人，主要是各种工作中的模范和积极分子，如生产模范、治黄功臣、模范军属等；另列席参加的五十五人（主要是有关机关干部）。这次各县的党代表会议，一般是达到了发扬民主，开展批评与自我批评，检查领导讨论工作的目的。
    开会前，各县都作了充分准备。选举代表时，规定了代表的条件，如立场稳、作风正派、对生产工作积极、与群众有密切联系、为群众所信任的、办事大公无私不贪污不浪费的。乙、同时进行深入的动员酝酿，普遍召开了乡村党员大会，除讲明代表条件以外，还着重说明党代会的性质与党员的权利和义务，有的县（滨县）还上了两次党课，以提高党员认识。
    会议开始，在说明党代会的意义任务和要求，集中代表的思想以后，县委即向大会报告工作和提出今后的工作方针。然后分组座谈，审查县委报告，检查领导，启发民主精神。这时再举行大会，展开讨论通过决定。在讨论今后任务制定决议时，也是同样的程序。会后并将区干部留下，讨论贯彻党代表会决议的办法。
    因此会议的收获很大：
    发扬民主，提高党员觉悟，检查县委领导
    甲、真正发扬了民主，检查了县委领导，不仅提高了到会代表的觉悟程度，同时也提高了领导者的思想水平。由于充分的进行了民主教育，个别酝酿，培养骨干，和领导上的表明态度，党员觉悟空前提高开展了批评与自我批评。如垦利党代会上，对宋家圈决口进行了尖锐的批评，有些代表说：“左家庄一号坝头那么险没有决口，宋家圈是平工决了口，这是县委领导上没有群众观念，事前缺乏准备。”对治黄中的缺点和错误，以及干部中的贪污果实、打骂群众等恶劣作风都提出了很多意见。又如蒲台不仅检查了县委的整个领导，而且批评了个别县委同志的作风问题，发言极为热烈，大会发言占百分之四十以上。另如无棣在审查县委工作报告时，有些代表提出：“县委的工作报告，有的不切合实际，检讨也不虚心。”有些县对县委布置工作，不根据具体情况前紧后松，领导不一致，解决问题不及时，提出了很多批评。再如滨县批评了县委的官僚主义：对干部赏罚不明，对农村支部长期缺乏教育，对下面情况不了解，发现问题不解决。阳信在检查县委报告中据不完全统计，提出意见九十三条，如对抗旱、防涝、代耕工作的领导，官僚主义，听喜不听忧等，作了严肃的批评，大大提高了到会代表的民主情绪。由于发扬了民主，检查了领导，使不少县委认识了自己领导与工作上的缺点和错误，同时转变了某些不相信群众，认为提不出什么意见来的错误思想。如利津县委在总结党代会中提到说：“这次党代表会议给我们县委上了一堂很实际很生动的课。教育了县委，帮助县委认识了错误，增强了群众观念，提高了大家觉悟。”有些代表也说：“像这个会如果早开，就不会出这些错误，这样的会多开几回才好！”
    讨论生产救灾工作，克服单纯任务观点
    乙、讨论与通过了冬季生产救灾工作决议。初步贯彻了党的领导，克服了领任务、交任务的单纯任务观点。各县在讨论与制定工作决议时，不仅根据群众的要求出发，更认真的逐字逐句的解释与通过，如有遗漏或有未包括进去的问题，即被代表们提出补充，态度非常认真，如惠民在讨论今后工作时，代表们根据群众的反映和意见提出五条：（１）要求发土地执照；（２）地级不平，不合理；（３）正确的处理婚姻问题；（４）解决副业的销路；（５）开办小学和冬学。又如无棣在通过决议时漏了几点，即被代表提出补充，即：“保护麦苗禁止麦地放牲口”，“生产救灾中结合处理积存果实”。同时，在讨论与通过决议时，对不同的意见与不正确的意见展开了争论，如蒲台蒲城乡代表提出：“我调查了的七户无衣无食灾民，县委区委也没解决。”别的代表说：“你调查了你为什么不动员群众生产自救呢？”又如惠民在讨论今后工作时，有的代表提出：“这些妇女提高了，离婚的更多。”当即受到了其他代表的批评和纠正。有的代表则提出了今年挖沟排水的领导作用，说明生产救灾非有领导不可。惠民的代表说：“人家不干咱先干，过去所想的生产不用领导是咱没领导！”特别是对生产救灾的方针和其中的具体问题，如“保证不冻死一个人”“保证不饿死一个人”“保证烈军工属不讨饭”“保证没有卖儿卖女的”等都作了详尽讨论。到会代表，对这些通过的决议非常重视，有的怕记不住，回去没法讲，找人抄决议。大家一致反映：“我们的意见都写上去了，实行了党员的权利，不能忘了党员的义务了！”“这次决议是大家定的，回去应该坚决贯彻。”有的说：“过去不积极，咱说不明白，这次明白了，应该下力干！”
    初步联系群众，打下公开党的基础
    丙、初步联系了群众打下公开党的基础。因为此次党代会议除阳信外，各县都邀请了党外群众参加，并征求了他们对各方面的意见，使到会群众感到共产党真是大公无私。有些参加会的群众说：“你看啥事不是为的老百姓打算，共产党真是为群众服务，只要共产党要我，我坚决要求参加共产党。”有的说：“这样的会应该早点开，早开几年，村里有了党员工作就可少犯错误，还会比现在作得好。”因而大大扩大了党的政治影响，初步的消除了党群之间的某些隔阂。在讨论与制定工作决议中，还着重讨论了公开党的问题，曾引起了到会代表的不少顾虑，如说：“党要公开了，这是上级不要咱了。”“好的可以公开，坏的可暂不公开。”“党员公开了，以后事不好办了。”县委领导上当即进行反复教育，再三说明公开党的意义和目的，使到会党员代表大部能够打破顾虑，稳定情绪。这给公开支部问题打下很好的思想基础。
    丁、经过党代会议的实际行动，教育了党员，使其了解党的基本知识和党的组织原则，提高了觉悟程度。因为在会议过程中，检查了县委领导，开展批评；在讨论与通过工作决议时，展开争论，使到会代表确实感到党内的民主精神。特别是举手表决，说明少数服从多数；全体代表通过的决议，又经过上级批准，说明下级服从上级；对县委进行了严肃的批评，对今后工作进行了充分的讨论，说明党员的权利。大家通过又经过上级批准的决议，党员必须坚决执行，说明了党的民主集中制的党员权利和义务等，这些教育比上几次党课效果要大得多。
    但是会议也还是有缺点的：
    会议缺点，事前认识不足，准备不够
    甲、对党代会认识不足，重视不够。有的认为党代会不如干部会解决问题，存在任务观点，认为开会是个手续。因而态度不够认真，缺乏充分酝酿和教育。有些代表对党代会认识模糊并存在顾虑，如：“这次开会不知又搞什么”等，因而，也证明了事前缺乏充分的动员和酝酿。更因事先民主教育不足。有些代表提意见时有顾虑，如：“是否报复？是否给小鞋穿？”“说多不如说少”，“得罪人找难看”等，这些怀疑虽在会议的实际行动中打破了；但也增加了会议的不少麻烦，拖拉了时间。
    乙、事前准备差，有的选代表很了草，有的邀请党外群众参加，也缺乏认真的态度，使有的群众代表发生怀疑和错觉，到会也不发表意见。
    丙、在审查县委报告和检查县委领导时，发言受到时间限制，有些代表的意见尚未全部发表出来。
    丁、对今后工作的意见，有的提的过多，在通过时念的很快，又缺乏具体解释；有的提的很简略，使到会代表感到：“太多”“很笼统”“不明白”接受不了，回去没法贯彻的困难。
    戊、在会议内容上，有的县过于零乱，没有重点的来解决几个主要问题。同时在讨论工作时，提的问题多，解决的办法少，使代表感到没处着手。
    己、会议上提意见多，开展争论少，有些问题缺乏作出结论，不能更好的开清是非，提高认识。
