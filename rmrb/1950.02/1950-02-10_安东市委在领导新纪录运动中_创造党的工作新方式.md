　　The An Dong Municipal Party Committee Creates New Ways of Party Work in Leading the New Record Movement
　　The General Branch goes deep into the workshop, combining with merit evaluation to absorb a large number of advanced production workers into the Party.
　　An Dong City publicly established the Party in factories in October 1948, adopting a public Party building approach to absorb a group of new Party members. However, because Party building was not closely enough integrated with the production movement, the vast majority of old technical workers and skilled workers were still excluded, and the Party branch could not quickly establish a leading core and prestige among the masses. In light of these circumstances, the An Dong Municipal Party Committee first started with the An Dong Paper Mill, proposing to combine the creation of new record movement with absorbing advanced production workers into the Party. The General Branch of the An Dong Paper Mill went deep into the workshops, identified candidates during the process of mass evaluation of those who created new records, completed the Party membership procedures through the workshop branches, and then announced it at the award ceremony. Because the individuals absorbed were all award-winning advanced producers, it gave the masses great education and stimulation. After the meeting, the masses called it "double happiness" and expressed their desire to create new records to strive for Party membership. On the other hand, it also educated Party members, making each Party member feel that they should become an advanced producer, which in turn played a role in consolidating and improving the Party's ideological level. This approach not only overcame the troubles and difficulties of simply holding meetings for public discussion, but also overcame the shortcomings of weak Party organization in important workshops and key production units by paying attention to the combination of Party building and production. After these technical workers, skilled workers, and old workers joined the Party, it not only added new blood and strength to the Party but also promoted the new record movement. For example, after Comrade Nie Zhongyi of the wood kettle room of the An Dong Paper Mill joined the Party, he created a new record of steaming a pot of soft material in eleven hours and five minutes, from the original new record of sixteen hours. Comrade Wang Deyou of the An Dong Machinery Factory initially created a new record of four hours and three minutes for the first vehicle bed body, from an estimated twenty-eight hours. After joining the Party, he created a new record of two hours and twenty minutes.
　　In the past three months, due to finding a new way of Party building, the Party led the new record movement, and the new record movement strengthened the Party. The Party also educated the workers, united the workers, and enabled mutual care, mutual assistance, and mutual learning among the workers, which brought the movement into a new climax.
　　I. How Factory Party Branches Unifiedly Lead Trade Unions and the Communist Youth League to Complete Production Tasks
　　Through Trade Unions and Workers' Representative Meetings, the Party Branch Closely Connects with the Masses
　　A. The most basic task of the factory Party is to educate Party members to closely connect with and rely on the workers, unite technical personnel, and strive to ensure the completion and exceeding of production plans and reduce costs. Trade unions and workers' representative meetings are the best organizational forms for the Party branch to connect with, educate, and organize workers. In the past, due to each doing their own thing, the Party branch was not good at using the organizational form of the trade union, which led to the failure of the trade union work, and the Party branch was in an isolated state. Since the launch of the new record movement, this situation has greatly changed. Under the overall goal of launching the new record movement and completing production tasks, the Municipal Party Committee ensured the consistency of the steps of the Party, trade union, and Youth League in the factories below from the leadership perspective, according to the overall work steps. The factory Party branch also promoted trade union work through Party members in the trade union, such as collecting new record deeds, promoting and rewarding them, mobilizing workers to sign workshop contract, and organizing the implementation of the contract, all through the trade union. When a trade union member is a Party member, they participate in the branch committee as a member and regularly report the trade union work to the branch committee and branch meeting. The Party branch, on the one hand, carefully listened to the report of the trade union and checked the execution of the instructions of the higher-level trade union and the resolutions of the Party and the progress of production according to the progress of the new record movement. But on the other hand, the Party branch shall not interfere with or monopolize the independent system and daily work of the trade union. The actual situation of the movement tells us that the quality of the work of the Party branch and the quality of the work of the trade union are often linked to each other. For example, before the new record movement in the An Dong Machinery Factory, the Party branch was very scattered and did not grasp the leadership of the trade union work, so the trade union was controlled by bad elements. Wu Bin, who provoked worker unity and sabotaged production, even became the chairman of the trade union, which led to the depression of workers' morale and frequent accidents in the factory, and production was very bad. Later, with the help of the Party, the trade union was rectified and transformed. The trade union truly helped the workers solve their difficulties (first of all, production difficulties), supported the workers' rationalization proposals, enabled them to be adopted by the administration, and cooperated with the administration to reward advanced workers. Since then, the morale of the workers has been boosted day by day, and a new record movement has been launched. A factory that was originally backward quickly became a relatively advanced factory.
　　Supporting the Communist Youth League, Promoting the Vanguard Role of Youth and Cultivating a New Generation of Technical Talents
　　B. The Party branch should seriously lead and help the Communist Youth League to organize young workers to play their role as youth shock workers. At the beginning of the movement, many young workers in factories responded to the call of the Party and the administration with their positive enthusiasm and vigorous posture. They walked in front of the movement. They promoted older workers and technical workers. After the movement was launched, young workers generally realized that they could not create new records with enthusiasm alone, and felt the pain of lacking technology. The Municipal Youth League Committee then mobilized and organized young workers to learn technology from older workers and technical workers, launched a mentor-apprentice contract movement, held technical lectures, and held symposiums for young workers and technical workers and older workers. The young workers of the An Dong Textile Factory held a respect-for-the-elderly meeting, and the older workers actively improved the young workers and promoted the unity of young workers and older workers. The Communist Youth League grasped this central link and created a heat wave of learning technology. Therefore, the technical level of young workers has been universally improved. This not only promoted the progress of the movement but also cultivated a new generation of young technical talents for the economic construction of New China.
　　II. Improve the Leadership Methods of Party-Mass Work and Establish a Normal Working System
　　During the emulation drive, the waste inspection movement, and the initial period of this new record movement, the Party-mass work in the factories was all in a mess. Meetings were held all day and all night, and technical and cultural learning for workers, education for Party members and League members, and even regular meetings in the Party, trade union, and Youth League organizational life were implicitly canceled. After the movement passed, it was reorganized from scratch. In short, daily organizational life and education were difficult to combine with the central movement.
　　Establish an Open Party and a System of Intra-Party Democracy to Improve Party-Mass Relations
　　Based on past experiences and lessons, the Municipal Party Committee studied and proposed how to make Party-mass work more planned in leadership and establish normal and regular systems under the overall goal of "increasing production, improving quality, reducing costs, and completing production tasks." The various systems that have been established and improved in the pilot projects in some factories during the new record movement are described as follows:
　　First, we insisted on and enriched the system of democratization of factory management. The Factory Management Committee and the Workers' Representative Meeting were mostly formalities in the past. Workers' representatives and trade union chairmen participated in the meeting but had nothing to say because they did not understand the situation. During the movement, on-site and large workshop management committees were established according to the requirements of the workers. The workers are very familiar with the situation in the workshop, and the problems discussed at the meeting are related to the problems in the on-site workshop. The Plant Management Committee is closely linked to the on-site workshop management committee. In the past, when the workers' representatives met, the cadres always talked more. Now, with the workshop production meeting, many problems have been solved in the workshop production meeting.
　　Second, the establishment of an open party and the promotion of intra-party democracy system: (1) Party branch meetings are open, absorbing worker representatives (voluntary participation) to attend the meeting; (2) Branch members and branch secretaries implement democratic elections, approved by the higher party committee, changing the past simple method of assignment; (3) The branch reports its work to all party members, putting the leadership of the party under the supervision of party members.
　　Third, the establishment of a system for checking production achievements and production progress through Party-mass work:
　　(1) The factory administration sends a copy of the daily production schedule to the Party, trade union, and Youth League, which facilitates the Party, trade union, and Youth League to check the actual situation according to the reflections from below and personally go deep into the site, and the leaders of the Party-mass work can also check the Party-mass work in each workshop according to the reports, which is one of the methods for the Party to ensure and supervise production. (2) The factory director regularly studies the production situation of the whole factory with the Party's general branch and reports the production situation in the factory to the general meeting of all party members, and puts forward the difficulties in production. In this way, the Party, trade union, and Youth League can check the administrative work according to the opinions of the masses, put forward suggestions for improving factory management, and mobilize workers to overcome difficulties and complete production tasks.
　　The Basic Shortcomings are the Imbalanced Development of the Movement, Insufficient Combination of Economic Work and Political Work, and Failure to Fully Utilize Advanced Forces to Promote Backwardness.
　　The basic shortcomings that currently exist are the uneven development of the movement. Economic work and political work are not sufficiently combined, advanced things are not promoted enough, and advanced forces are not fully utilized to promote backwardness, thus burying many mass creations and failing to promote a large number of new cadres. The future tasks are defined as: to organize technical learning in a more planned way, to cultivate and promote a large number of Party-mass work cadres, and to do a good job in propaganda and mobilization to ensure that the new record movement is more fulfilling.

　　安东市委在领导新纪录运动中  创造党的工作新方式
    总支深入车间，结合评功，大量吸收生产先进分子入党。
    安东市是一九四八年十月在工厂中公开了党，采取公开建党的办法，吸收了一批新党员。但由于建党与生产运动密切结合不够，绝大多数老的技术工人、熟练工人尚关在门外，党的支部在群众中不能迅速的树立起领导核心和威信。安东市委根据了这些情况，首先从安东造纸厂开始，提出结合创纪录运动，吸收生产中先进分子入党。安东造纸厂党的总支深入车间，在群众对创造新纪录者的评功过程中，物色对象，并经各车间支部履行了入党手续，而后在给奖大会上公布。由于被吸收的对象皆是受奖的生产先进者，给群众很大教育和刺激，会后群众叫“双喜临门”，纷纷表示要创造新纪录争取入党。另一方面又教育了党员，使每个党员都感觉到自己应成为生产先进者，这样又起了巩固与提高党的思想水平作用。这种方式不仅克服了单纯开会进行公议的麻烦与困难，并由于注意了建党与生产结合，克服了重要车间和重要生产单位中党的组织力量薄弱的缺点。这些技术工人、熟练工人和老工人入党后，不仅使党增加了新的血液和力量，并且又推动了新纪录运动。如安东造纸厂木釜室聂忠义同志入党后，从蒸煮一锅软料子十六小时的新纪录，又创造了十一小时零五分蒸煮一锅的最高纪录。安东机械厂王德有同志第一次车插床体由估工二十八小时创造了四时零三分的新纪录。入党后，又创造了二时二十分的最高新纪录。
    三个月来，由于摸到了建党的新方式，党领导了新纪录运动，新纪录运动又壮大了党。党又教育了工人，团结了工人，使工人之间互相关心、互相帮助、互相学习，又使运动进入新的高潮。
    一、工厂党的支部如何统一领导工会、青年团来完成生产任务
  通过工会及工人代表会使党的支部密切联系群众
    甲、工厂党的最基本工作是教育党员紧密联系与依靠工人群众，团结技术人员，为保证完成及超过生产计划降低成本而奋斗。工会与工人代表会议又是党的支部去联系、教育与组织职工群众的最好组织形式。以往由于各搞一套，党的支部不善于利用工会的组织形式，以致工会工作没有开展，而党的支部也陷于孤立的状态。自从发动创造新纪录运动以来，这种情况就大大改变了。在发动创造新纪录运动，完成生产任务的总目标下，市委根据总的工作步骤，从领导上保证了下面各工厂党、工、青步调的一致。工厂党的支部又通过工会内的党员推动工会工作，例如搜集新纪录事迹，加以推广奖励，发动工人订立车间联系合同，及组织合同的实现等等，均通过工会去做。工会委员为党员时，参加支部委员会为委员，并定期向支部委员会及支部大会报告工会工作。党的支部一方面认真听取了工会的报告，并根据创造新纪录运动的进展程度，检查工会执行上级工会的指示与党的决议及推动生产的情况。但另一方面，党的支部对工会的独立系统与日常工作，则不得干涉与包办。运动的实际情况告诉我们：党的支部工作好坏，与工会工作的好坏常常是互相联结的。例如：安东机械厂创造新纪录运动前党的支部非常涣散，对工会工作没有抓紧领导，因而工会为不良分子所掌握。挑拨工人团结、破坏生产的吴彬，竟然当了工会主任，以致工人情绪消沉，工厂不断发生事故，生产非常糟糕。后来经过党的帮助，整顿与改造了工会。工会真正帮助工人解决了困难（首先是生产上的困难），支持工人的合理化建议，使之为行政上采纳，并协同行政上奖励了先进工人。从此工人情绪便日益振作起来，而掀起创造新纪录运动。一个原来落后的工厂，很快变为比较先进的工厂。
  扶植青年团，发扬青年先锋作用培养新的一代技术人材
    乙、党的支部，要认真的领导和帮助青年团来组织青年工人发挥其青年突击手作用。在运动开始时，许多工厂的青年工人，以其积极热情和生龙活虎的姿态，响应了党与行政的号召。他们走在运动的前面。他们推动了老年工人和技术工人。运动开展后，青工普遍认识了单凭热情不能创造新纪录，感到没有技术的痛苦。市团委紧接着动员和组织青年工人向老年工人、技术工人学习技术，开展了订立师徒合同运动，举行技术讲座，青工与技术工、老年工的座谈会。安东纺织厂的青工开敬老会，老年工人积极起来又提高了青年工人，促进了青年工人与老年工人团结。青年团抓住这中心的一环，造成学习技术的热潮。因此普遍的提高了青工技术水平。这不仅推动了运动的前进，而且给新中国的经济建设培养出新的青年一代的技术人材。
    二、改善党群工作的领导方法和建立正常的工作制度
    在立功竞赛运动中，检查浪费运动中，以及这次创纪录运动开始时期，工厂中的党群工作都是手忙脚乱。整天整夜开会，关于工人的技术文化学习，党员团员的教育工作，甚至党、工、青组织生活中的例会，也无形中取消了。运动过去之后，又从新来整理，总之日常的组织生活与教育，很难与中心运动相结合。
  建立公开党与党内民主制度改善党群关系
    市委根据过去的经验教训，研究与提出如何在“增加产量，提高质量，降低成本，完成生产任务”的总目标下，使党群工作在领导上更有计划性并建立正常的正规的各种制度。现将创纪录运动中在某些工厂试点中所建立与健全的各种制度分述如下：
    第一、坚持和充实了工厂管理民主化制度。工厂管理委员会和工人代表会，过去多半是流于形式，工人代表、工会主任，参加了会由于不了解情况又无言可发。在运动中，根据工人的要求成立了现场和大的车间管委会。工人对车间情况满熟悉，开会讨论问题都与现场车间问题相连。全厂管委会与现场车间管委会取得密切联系。工人代表会过去开起会来，总是干部讲的多，现在有了车间生产会议，许多问题在车间生产会议上都解决了。
    第二、建立了公开党与发扬党内民主制度：（１）党的支部会议公开，吸收工人代表（自愿参加）列席会议；（２）支部委员、支部书记实行民主选举，由上级党委批准，改变了过去的单纯委派的办法；（３）支部向所有党员报告工作，使党的领导放在党员群众监督之下。
    第三、建立经过党群工作检查生产成绩与生产进程的制度：
    （１）工厂行政将每日生产进度表送给党、工、青一份，这样一方面便于党、工、青根据下面反映与亲自深入现场检查与实际情况相对照，另外党群工作领导者亦可根据表报来检查各车间的党群工作，这是党来保证与监督生产方法之一。（２）厂长定期与党的总支研究全厂生产情况和向全体党员大会报告工厂中的生产情况，并提出生产中存在着的困难问题。这样党、工、青可根据群众意见检查行政工作和提出改善工厂管理的建议，并动员工人来克服困难完成生产任务。
    基本缺点是运动发展不平衡，经济工作与政治工作结合不够，没有充分发挥先进力量推动落后
    目前存在的基本缺点是运动的发展不平衡。经济工作与政治工作结合不够，对先进事物发扬的不够，没有充分地运用先进力量推动落后，因而埋没了许多群众创造，也没有大量地提拔新干部。今后的任务规定为：更有计划地组织学习技术，大量培养与提拔党群工作干部，同时做好宣传鼓动工作，保证新纪录运动更加饱满。
