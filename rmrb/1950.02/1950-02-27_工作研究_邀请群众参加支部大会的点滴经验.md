　　Some Experiences in Inviting the Masses to Participate in Branch General Meetings
　　Compiled by Zhang Fu, Baoding Street Party Committee

Inviting the masses to participate in Party branch general meetings is a new task since the Party became public, and it is also an important method for the Party to connect with the masses. We do not yet have mature experience in this regard. We would like to write down a few experiences we have gained in our work and study them with everyone.

　　I. Make Full Preparations Before the Meeting. Each meeting should have a specific purpose, and the issues to be resolved should be deliberated in advance. At the same time, the masses invited to participate in the meeting should be informed of the issues to be resolved in advance, so that they can prepare their opinions. Otherwise, inviting the masses to participate in the meeting will become a formality. The Seventh Street branch did this when inviting the masses to evaluate new Party members joining the Party, and the results were very good. At the meeting, the masses spoke actively and seriously. For example, on the issue of Yang's admission to the Party, different opinions were raised: "His qualifications for joining the Party are not yet sufficient. He only wrote about four family members on his application, when he has seven. He is not honest and deceives the Party, which is not enough to meet the requirements for joining the Party." Conversely, in other places, because the non-Party masses were not well informed in advance, everyone was unprepared, resulting in very few speeches and little effect from the meeting.

　　II. Carefully Select the Invitees. The composition of urban residents is very complex. Therefore, when inviting people, it is necessary to select representative working people to participate in the meeting, and not just invite a few people casually. When the 20th Street branch evaluated new Party members joining the Party, they invited several shop managers to participate. These people talked about their own affairs at the meeting. For example, a manager of a certain soy sauce garden said: "When business is good, we can employ more people, and when business is slow, we can employ fewer people, or we will have to eat up our capital." This caused the meeting to deviate from the center and wasted time. The Fourth Street branch invited a few people who had done bad things and a landlord who had been struggled against, resulting in a chaotic meeting, arousing dissatisfaction among the masses and the person being evaluated. The next day, someone went to question the comrades working in the branch: "Who are they, and why are they also invited to participate in the meeting?"

　　III. The best way to evaluate new Party members joining the Party is for the introducer to read the applicant's application aloud in public, and then everyone provides their opinions. However, it should be noted that opinions should be raised at the meeting as much as possible. If there are opinions after the meeting, they can be raised to the branch, but they are not allowed to be spread around casually after the meeting. After the 18th Street branch's evaluation, some Party members immediately found the person being evaluated and said: "So-and-so does not agree with you joining the Party!" This affected unity. The branch should also pay close attention to conducting ideological education for those who fail to pass the evaluation at the branch general meeting, explain their strengths and weaknesses, and help them continue to temper themselves in practical work and improve until they fully meet the requirements for joining the Party.

　　IV. Sincerely listen to and adopt the correct opinions of the masses, and promptly and patiently explain the incorrect opinions. The meeting should encourage the masses to speak more. If there are different opinions, the branch should patiently explain its own reasoning and adhere to correct principles. The masses are generally restrained when participating in our meetings for the first time, holding a "listen and see" attitude. The branch should pay attention to changing this attitude, otherwise their opinions will be kept in their stomachs.

　　邀请群众参加支部大会的点滴经验

    邀请群众参加党的支部大会，是党公开后的一件新工作，也是党联系群众的重要方法之一。对此我们还没有成熟的经验。愿将我们在工作中已经摸索到的几点经验写出来，和大家研究。
    一、会前要有充分准备。每次开会都要有一定的目的，准备解决什么问题，事先都要经过酝酿。同时要把解决的问题，事先告知被邀请参加会议的群众，以便准备意见。否则，邀请群众参加会议将成为形式。七街支部邀请群众评议新党员入党时，就是这样作的，结果很好。在会议上群众发言积极，认真。如对杨某的入党问题，就提出不同的意见：“他入党的条件还不够。他七口人申请书上只写四口人。他说话不实在，欺瞒党，这就不够入党条件。”相反的，在另外一些地方，因事先未很好通知党外群众，大家无准备，结果发言很少，会议收效甚微。
    二、慎重选择邀请的对象。城市居民的成份十分复杂，因此邀请对象时更须选择有代表性的劳动人民参加会议。而不能马马虎虎邀请几个人。二十街支部评议新党员入党时，邀请了几个铺子经理参加，这些人到会议上就说自己的事情，如某酱园经理说：“买卖好时可多用几个人，背月时可以少雇几个人，不然也得吃干了。”使会议离开了中心，浪费了时间。四街支部邀请了几个作过坏事的，和一个被斗的地主，结果弄得会议乱七八糟，引起群众不满，引起被评者不满。第二天就有人去质问支部工作同志：“他们是什么人，为什么也叫他们参加会议。”
    三、评议新党员入党的方式，最好由介绍人将被介绍人的申请书当众宣读，然后大家提供意见。但要注意有意见尽量在会议上提出，会后有意见可向支部提出，但不许在会后随便传播。十八街支部评议后，有的党员即找到被评议的对象说：“某某不同意你入党！”以致影响了团结。对在支部大会上未能通过的人，支部也应抓紧进行思想教育，说明他的优点和缺点，帮助他继续在实际工作中锻炼、提高到完全具备入党的条件。
    四、虚心听取与采纳群众正确意见，对不正确的意见应及时的耐心的解释。会议中应启发群众多说话。遇有不同意见支部要耐心说明自己的道理，坚持正确原则。群众初次参加我们的会议，一般是有拘束的，抱有“听听再说”的态度。支部就应注意改变他们这种态度，不然他们的意见即会放在肚里不说。
