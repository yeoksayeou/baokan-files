　　Dalian Ship Repair and Shipbuilding Factory
    Deeply Implements New Record Movement for Production, Liaison, and Assessment Contracts
    [This Newspaper News] According to the "Luda People's Daily," in order to ensure the continued, widespread, and in-depth development of the new production record movement, the Dalian Ship Repair and Shipbuilding Factory universally signed "Production Contracts," "Liaison Contracts," and "Assessment Contracts" in January. Currently, with the close cooperation of the factory's administration, Party, and Trade Union, the Trade Union has specifically assisted the Ship Repair Factory in signing "Production Contracts" with sixteen workshops. The Fitter Factory has signed "Liaison Contracts" with the Copper Workers, Lathe, Foundry, and Ship Repair Factories. The Forging Factory has signed "Assessment Contracts" and has begun formal implementation. Other factories are also actively investigating, researching, and revising assessment standards.
    After the new record movement was launched in the Ship Repair Factory, the leadership discovered many shortcomings in various workshops. These are reflected in: ① The production plans of each workshop are inaccurate, making it impossible to clearly arrange tasks. ② After receiving tasks, each workshop cannot distinguish between the importance and urgency according to the overall requirements, resulting in sometimes completing less important tasks first, while the main tasks cannot be completed, thus the overall production task suffers losses. ③ When tasks cannot be completed, the responsibilities of each factory are not clear, resulting in mutual buck-passing, and the leadership cannot clarify responsibilities to determine the objects of criticism and commendation. In view of the above situation, the leadership decided to focus on the Ship Repair Factory, and first formally signed production contracts between the General Factory and the Ship Repair Factory, and between the Ship Repair Factory and various workshops, in conjunction with the first quarter's production tasks. In the contract signed between the General Factory and the Ship Repair Factory, it is stipulated that the supply of raw materials is guaranteed and a reward and punishment system is implemented for exceeding or failing to complete tasks. The Ship Repair Factory then signed production contracts with its sixteen subordinate workshops to guarantee the completion of production tasks.
    As the new record movement gradually became widespread and in-depth, the various factories, due to the lack of close contact and cooperation, resulted in the completion of tasks by workshops and teams, but the factory's overall tasks could not be completed. At the same time, the phenomenon of waiting for tasks between factories due to poor coordination was also discovered. In order to correct this deviation, under the specific guidance of the Party Committee, the Trade Union focused on the Copper Workers, Foundry, and Lathe Factories, and signed a liaison contract on the 18th. Workers in each factory also put forward mutual guarantee conditions at the meeting. To ensure the implementation of the contract, the Fitter Factory sent two technicians to be specifically responsible for inspecting the implementation of the contract. At the same time, the Ship Repair Factory also signed liaison contracts with the Foundry, Steel Foundry, and other factories.
    In the new record movement, the productivity of each factory has been improved, but it has been found that many old assessment quotas are no longer suitable for the new production level. For example, the assessment quotas of various workshops in the Shipbuilding Factory generally need to be reduced by 20%. There are also many deviations in the number of work hours determined in the past. In the past, due to the lack of correct labor estimation standards as a basis, cadres randomly increased and decreased the number of work hours and modified the timing, so workers were afraid of the administration "cutting points," which became a major obstacle to the development of the movement. Therefore, the administration took the Forging Factory as a typical example, and after specific research in the factory, it formulated labor estimation standards, increasing the low labor estimations of the past and decreasing the high ones. Now the administration has formally signed contracts with each workshop, determining that the labor estimation standards will be revised every six months to one year, so that workers can concentrate all their efforts on improving production.

### 大连修船造船工厂  订生产、联系、查定合同新纪录运动深入开展

　　大连修船造船工厂
    订生产、联系、查定合同新纪录运动深入开展
    【本报讯】据旅大人民日报报道：为保证创生产新纪录运动继续广泛与深入展开，大连修船造船厂在一月份内普遍签订“生产合同”、“联系合同”、“查定合同”。目前在该厂行政、党、工会的密切配合下，工会已具体协助修船厂与十六个职场签订了“生产合同”；钳工厂已与铜工、旋盘、铸造、修船等厂签订了“联系合同”；锻工厂已签订“查定合同”，并开始正式执行。其他各厂亦积极着手调查、研究与修正查定标准。
    新纪录运动在修船厂开展以后，领导上便发现了各职场存在着很多缺点，这表现在：①各职场的生产计划不准确，无法明确布置任务；②各职场接到了任务以后，不能根据总的要求分清轻重缓急，结果有时将较次要的任务先完成了，而主要的任务不能完成，总的生产任务因而受到损失；③当任务不能完成时，各厂责任不明确，因此互相推诿，领导上也无法弄清责任，确定批评与表扬的对象。鉴于上述情况，领导上决定以修船厂为重点，首先结合第一季生产任务正式签订了总厂与修船厂，修船厂与各职场之间的生产合同。总厂在与修船厂签订的合同中，规定保证原料的供应与实行超过或未完成任务的赏罚制度；修船厂则与所属十六个职场签订了保证完成生产任务的生产合同。
    在新纪录运动逐渐走向广泛与深入以后，各厂由于缺乏相互间的密切联系配合，结果虽车间、小组完成了任务，但全厂任务却不能完成。同时，在各厂也发现了由于配合不好互相等任务的现象。为了纠正这种偏差，工会在党委的具体指导下，抓紧铜工、铸造、旋盘三厂，于十八日订立了联系合同，各厂工友并在会上互相提出保证条件。为保证贯彻合同，钳工厂派了两个技师专司检查合同执行情况之责。与此同时，修船厂亦与铸造、铸钢等厂签订了联系合同。
    在新纪录运动中，各厂生产力均有提高，但发现了许多旧的查定定额已不适于新的生产水平。如造船厂各职场查定定额普遍需要降低百分之二十。过去确定的工数也存在不少偏差。过去由于没有正确的估工标准为依据，干部乱增乱减工数，修改定时，因而工友怕行政“割点”，成为开展运动的极大障碍。因此，行政以锻工为典型，在该厂经过具体研究，作出了估工标准，过去估工低的予以提高，高的则予降低。现在行政上已与各工场正式签订合同，确定半年到一年内修改一次估工标准，使工友们集中全力于提高生产。
