　　American Anguish
　　Lao She

　　When Europeans initially resolved to abandon their homelands and relocate to North America to establish new lives, they must have been subjected to religious, political, or economic oppression in their native countries, aspiring to build a nation in a new land with freedom of religion, thought, and labor.

　　They indeed constructed a new nation, founded upon the principles of liberty and equality, as understood at the time.

　　Logically, such a nation should have become a terrestrial paradise, where everyone is free, equal, and happy.

　　However, those who migrated to North America in pursuit of religious freedom began to exclude the religions of others as soon as they set foot on land. They did obtain the freedom to worship God according to their own will, but they did not allow others the same freedom. Thus, from the founding of the United States to the present day, religious freedom has remained a problem and a source of conflict, without true liberty. Today, a presidential or congressional candidate can still lose an election because of their religious beliefs—regardless of their political views or abilities.

　　Religion, by its very nature, tends to be mutually exclusive rather than unifying. Religion seeks control, not democracy. Many Irish and Jewish people have tragically died in this nation of "religious freedom" because of their faith.

　　The freedom of speech that Americans pride themselves on is as farcical as religious freedom. Every American feels they have the freedom to express their opinions, but how many Americans have actually expressed their opinions? Asking this question bluntly touches their sore spot.

　　Consider: the nation's newspapers and periodicals are monopolized by a few wealthy merchants. How can ordinary people find a place to practice freedom of speech there? Furthermore, apart from a few serious newspapers that retain a "Letters to the Editor" section, publishing one or two letters from well-known figures daily, other small newspapers all rush to publish sensational tabloid news, crime stories, football and boxing results as their main attractions. Where is there room to publish readers' opinions? Moreover, advertising revenue does not allow "Letters to the Editor" to take up space.

　　What about radio? Radio stations are private businesses. Apart from "soap operas" (note), there is almost nothing else. How can a citizen get the opportunity to use the radio to express their opinions?

　　Then, writing a book might be a good idea. Humph, if you are not a celebrity, or have not published a best-selling book, who would accept your work?

　　Newspapers, periodicals, radio, and books are all commercialized. The bosses want to hear and see certain opinions, and you have to say what they want to hear; otherwise, you better keep your mouth shut. Obeying the bosses' wishes in publishing and broadcasting, as well as in movies and literature, creates "trends of thought." Those who speak and write in accordance with the "trend" can receive high rewards. Thus, in the past two or three years, anti-communism has become the trend of thought. Everything one hears and sees is about anti-communism, only resulting in seeing ghosts in broad daylight, making everyone panic.

　　Freedom of thought is naturally impossible under this anti-communist trend. Communists are turned into criminals for their ideas, and professors and civil servants with progressive ideas are dismissed from their posts. The spirit of the founding of the United States is utterly lost.

　　Therefore, Americans are in anguish!

　　Without equality, there is no freedom. At the founding of the United States, those who fought for freedom sincerely wished to establish a nation with freedom of religion, thought, and speech. Today, for the widespread promotion of "Americanism," such slogans can still be seen everywhere: "Here, everyone can believe in the religion they wish to believe in, can say what they wish to say, and can do what they wish to do!"

　　However, from the founding of their nation to the present day, Americans have only seen "freedom" and have forgotten the most important economic equality.

　　Without economic equality, although the United States is vast and rich in resources and has a small population, it has not become a terrestrial paradise where everyone is well-fed and clothed, and everyone is happy. Because there is no economic equality, although there is only one president, there are many emperors: newspaper emperors, oil emperors, steel emperors, bank emperors, and so on. These emperors possess billions in wealth and can control speech, manipulate elections, and determine national policy. Cigarettes could have been sold for ten cents a pack, but after the cigarette emperors defeated the smaller cigarette factories, they forcibly priced them at twenty cents a pack. By analogy, the American people's livelihoods are entirely manipulated in the hands of these emperors.

　　The emperors call control, manipulation, and speculation free competition, and free competition means whoever has the means and opportunity becomes the emperor, and whoever does not becomes a slave. Thus, there are only a few emperors, but hundreds of thousands of slaves.

　　The emperors control newspapers and periodicals, so there is no freedom of speech. The emperors use money to manipulate elections, thus depriving people of the freedom to participate in political activities. This is also a major reason for the indifference of some Americans towards politics. Newspapers, radio, books, and movies, because they are controlled by the emperors, specialize in providing materials that numb people's minds, so people cannot help but read, listen to, and watch some boring things, and neglect world events and political issues. This has led to the decline of American culture.

　　Because of insufficient understanding of politics, economics, and culture, and having been numb for too long, people not only do not want to resist those emperors, but also fantasize that one day they will also become emperors or kings. They even tell stories "with poetry as proof": Wasn't so-and-so king originally from a peddler's background? This has become their traditional dream.

　　Indeed, during the period when the United States was expanding westward, some poor boys did become kings. However, the current United States has passed the era of expansion, and those emperors are firmly seated on their thrones. Where can people go to find gold, rob treasures, and establish dynasties? Moreover, isn't the suffering that everyone is experiencing today due to the historical errors of previous free competition, the dog-eat-dog history?

　　However, many Americans continue to dream. And they will state with certainty: only in the United States, because everyone is free, there is free competition, and there is the reality of poor men becoming kings. This illusion makes them most susceptible to anti-communist propaganda. Capitalist newspapers, periodicals, radio, and movies all tell them unanimously: in the Soviet Union, there is no personal freedom, no freedom at all. This propaganda is quite successful. The dog-eat-dog liberalism has already deeply rooted in people's hearts, and people naturally oppose socialism. The Republicans still gnash their teeth when they hear the name Roosevelt, let alone mention Stalin?

　　Of course, there are also many enlightened people and people with progressive ideas in the United States. However, today, warlords, politicians, and capitalists collude with each other, setting up a net of anti-communist and defense-communist measures. Timid people, even if they are enlightened and progressive, have to remain silent. Only Communist Party members dare to risk moving forward, but they are already suffering great persecution.

　　For the sake of anti-communism and defense-communism, Americans have almost lost the very small amount of freedom they originally had in the past three years.

　　Therefore, Americans are in anguish; especially those enlightened people.

　　Although it is not easy to understand and accept socialism, Americans do hate Hitler, Mussolini, and those fascist demons. Recently, they have also rejected Chiang Kai-shek. However, in the past three or four years, the power of warlords and secret agents has been expanding daily, and everyone is in danger, making them unable to deny that the black shadow of fascism has enveloped the entire country.

　　What to do? They have been deceived by the rulers for a long time and believe in the two-party parliamentary system. This means that they are willing to have two parties check each other, thereby obtaining moderate and gradual improvements. They want gradual progress, not revolution. However, if there is a suitable opportunity, they can see that the fascist forces are trying to seize power with a swift blitzkrieg at any moment, turning the United States into the last fascist country in the world, which would also be the end of the United States. They do not yet fully understand revolution, but it seems difficult to prevent the rapid advance of fascism without revolution. What to do?

　　Therefore, Americans are in anguish.

　　(Note) "Soap opera" is a type of advertising program written by broadcasting companies to sell soap. It often tells detective stories or performs vaudeville, and in the middle of the excitement, it will inevitably mention the soap's trademark, price, and all its benefits. Now, the term "soap opera" has become a common term for all commercial advertising broadcasting programs, and it also contains the meaning of being worthless and of low taste.

### 美国人的苦闷

　　美国人的苦闷
    老舍
    当初在欧洲人下决心离弃故乡，迁往北美去成家立业的时候，他们必是在故国受着宗教的，政治的，或经济的压迫，而想去到一块新土地上，建设一个信教自由，思想自由，劳作自由的国家。
    他们也真的建设起一个新国家，而且是以当时所了解的自由，平等为立国精神的国家。
    按道理说，这样的一个国家应当会变成地上的乐园，人人自由，人人平等，人人快活。
    可是，那些为争取信教自由而移往北美的人们，刚一登岸，便排斥别人的宗教。他们的确得到顺着自己的心意去礼拜上帝的自由，可是他们不许别人也有这同样的自由。于是，从美国开国直到今天，信教自由始终是个问题与纠纷，并没有真正的自由。在今天，一个总统或议员竞选人，还可以因为宗教信仰而落选——不管他的政治主张与才力是如何的高明。
    宗教，由于本质来说，本是互相排斥，而不是彼此团结的东西。宗教要的是统制，不要民主。许多爱尔兰人与犹太人曾经因为他们的宗教惨死在这“信教自由”的国家里。
    美国人所引以自豪的言论自由也与信教自由同样的滑稽。每个美国人都觉得他有发表言论的自由，可是到底有多少美国人曾发表过言论呢？这么一问，便很不客气地戳到他们的痒痒肉上儿。
    看吧：全国的报纸与定期刊物既被几家富商包办着，一般的人怎能在那里借地方练习言论自由呢？再看：除了几家态度较比严肃的大报留有“读者来函”一栏，天天登载一两封知名人士的函件，其他的小报一律以争先登出，尽情报导桃色新闻，强盗新闻，足球与赛拳消息为能事，哪还有隙地刊登读者的意见呢。况且，广告的收入也不允许“来函”占去地位呀。
    广播吗？广播电台都是私人的营业，“胰皂歌剧”（注）而外，差不多没有什么别的东西，一个公民怎能得到利用广播发表意见的机会呢？
    那么，写书好啦。哼，你若不是名人，不是曾经出版过能畅销的书籍，谁肯接受你的著作呢。
    报纸，刊物，广播，书籍，都是商业化了的东西，老板们愿意要什么，你就得说什么；否则你顶好闭口无言。顺着老板的心意，出版与广播，旁及电影与文艺，就有了“思潮”。迎合“潮流”讲话为文的，便能得到很高的酬报。于是，在最近二三年中，反共成为思潮，视听所及，全是反共；只落得白昼见鬼，大家心慌。
    思想不能自由，在这反共思潮之下，乃理之当然。共产党员因思想问题而变成罪犯，思想前进的教授与公务员因思想问题而被撤职，美国立国的精神，至此而丧失净尽。
    所以，美国人苦闷！
    没有平等，就没有自由。在美国开国的时候，那些为自由而奋斗的人们是诚心的愿意建立一个信教自由，思想自由，和言论自由的国家。在今天，为了“美国主义”的广泛宣传，到处还能看见这样的标语：“在这里，人人可以信仰他愿信的宗教，可以说他愿说的话，可以作他愿作的事！”
    可是，自他们立国以至今日，美国人只看到“自由”，而忘了那最紧要的经济的平等。
    既没有经济的平等，所以美国虽然地大物博，人口又少，而并没能成为人人饱食暖衣，人人快乐的地上乐园。因为没有经济上的平等，所以虽然只有一位总统，而有许多位皇帝；报纸皇帝，煤油皇帝，钢铁皇帝，银行皇帝等等。这些位皇帝据有亿万的财富，也就可以控制言论，操纵选举，决定国策。香烟本来可以卖一角钱一包，但在香烟皇帝打倒了弱小的香烟厂们以后，便硬作价二角钱一包了。以此类推，美国的民生物用便全玩弄在皇帝的手心上了。
    皇帝们把统制，操纵，与投机叫做自由竞争，而自由竞争便是谁有手段与机会谁做皇帝，谁没有谁作奴隶。于是，皇帝只有几位，而奴隶却成千论万。
    皇帝控制着报纸与刊物，言论于是没有了自由。皇帝用金钱操纵选举，于是剥夺了人民在政治上活动的自由。这也就是一部分美国人对于政治的淡漠的主要原因。新闻纸，广播，书籍，电影，因为被皇帝们所控制，专门供给麻醉人心的材料，人们也就无法不读一些，听一些，看一些无聊的东西，而忽略了世界大事与政治问题。这就形成了美国文化的低落。
    因为对政治，经济，文化的认识不够，和被麻醉得过久，人们不单不想反抗那些皇帝，而且幻想着自由有朝一日也变为什么皇帝或大王。他们也“有诗为证”的述说：某某大王不原来是小贩出身吗？这成了他们的传统的梦想。
    不错，在美国正向西部开拓的时期，的确有些苦小子变成大王的事。可是，现在的美国已走过了开拓时期，那些皇帝已安踞宝座；人们上哪里去寻金劫宝，和创立王朝呢？再说，今日大家所受的困苦，还不是以前的自由竞争，狗吃狗的历史错误所赐么？
    可是，很多的美国人还是继续作着梦。而且会有板有眼的陈说：只有美国，因为人人自由，才有自由竞争，才有苦汉作大王的事实。这个迷梦使他们最容易接受反共的宣传。资本家们的报纸，刊物，广播，电影，一致的告诉他们：在苏联，没有个人自由，没有任何自由，这宣传是相当成功的。狗吃狗的自由主义既已深入人心，人们当然反对社会主义。那共和党的人们听到罗斯福的姓名还要咬牙切齿，何况是提起斯大林呢？
    美国当然也有不少的明白人和思想前进的人。可是，在今天，军阀，政客，资本家，勾结在一处，设下一个反共防共的天罗地网，胆小一点的人，虽然明白，前进，也不得不噤若寒蝉了。只有共产党党员还敢冒险前进，可是他们已受着很大的迫害。
    为了反共防共，三年来美国人把原有的很小的一点自由也快丢光了。
    所以，美国人苦闷；特别是那些明白人。
    虽然不易了解与接受社会主义，美国人可的确厌恶希特拉，墨索里尼，那些法西斯恶魔。近来，他们也厌弃蒋介石了。可是，在最近的三四年中，军阀与特务的势力日见扩大，人人自危，使他们没法不承认法西斯的黑影已笼罩住全国。
    怎么办呢？他们受了统治者长期的蒙蔽，相信两党的议会制度。这也就是说，他们愿意有两个政党互相牵制，从而得到适可而止的逐渐改进。他们要渐进，不要革命。但是，假若有适当的机会，他们看得出来，法西斯势力天天想用迅雷不及掩耳的闪击抓到政权，使美国变成世界上最后的法西斯国家，也就是美国的末日。他们还不很了解革命，可是不革命似乎又难以阻止法西斯的突飞猛进。怎么办呢？
    所以，美国人苦闷。
    （注）“胰皂歌剧”乃广播公司为卖胰皂的撰作广告节目，它往往是说侦探故事，或表演杂耍，演奏到热闹中间，必提出胰皂的商标、价钱、与它一切的好处。现在，“胰皂歌剧”一语已成为一切商业广告的广播节目的普通称呼，亦含有没有价值，低级趣味之意。
