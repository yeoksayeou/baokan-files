　　A Workers' Literacy School
　　Before March of last year, the Pier No. 5 branch of the Dalian-Lushun Literacy School had opened classes three times, and collapsed three times. This was partly because two-thirds of the students were over forty years old and showed little confidence in literacy, and partly because the leadership lacked experience in running literacy schools. However, the trade union cadres were not discouraged by this. They persevered and finally set up the school, enabling a large number of dockworkers to begin their new cultural lives. By November of last year, the school had achieved great success. Seventy percent of the students (84 people) completed and exceeded the annual plan of learning 700 characters. Thirty-six elderly students over the age of forty-five also learned 300 to 500 characters. Many students were able to read the employee newspaper, write articles for the wall newspaper, and write letters. Lin Xishan, a 59-year-old worker, was not only able to write letters home, but also able to write letters for his neighbors. When the Dalian-Lushun area conducted literacy movement award ceremonies last November, the No. 5 branch won the title of "Special Model Literacy School." One person was awarded Special Model Teacher, seven people were awarded Second-Class Model Students, and eleven people were awarded Third-Class Model Students.
　　Why was this school, whose foundation was not very good, able to transform into a special model school? This is inseparable from the leadership of the trade union and the efforts of the teachers.
　　Initially, when it was discovered that workers generally lacked confidence in literacy, the trade union decided to start by opening up the workers' minds. Teacher Cong Longquan went deep among the workers to carry out patient persuasion. He once heard old worker Zhang Chengfa say: "I'm half buried in the ground, what's the point of learning! I didn't get a chance to study when I was young, and now I'm old, it's no good!" After hearing this, he said to Zhang Chengfa: "It's precisely because you didn't get a chance to study when you were young that you should study hard now. Today's learning is different from our learning when we were young. It's not learning the 'Three Character Classic,' which requires a lot of effort, and it's not very useful after you've learned it. Today's learning is not only easier than before, but it's also useful after you've learned it. It doesn't matter if you're old and your hands aren't very obedient, it will get better over time. Come to study every day, I'll teach you, you can try it." He also often told the workers stories about the War of Resistance. Because his stories were vivid, popular, and suited the workers' tastes, he quickly established prestige among the workers. The workers called him "storyteller." Seeing this situation, he said: "Since everyone loves to listen to me tell stories, please come to the literacy school!" In this way, the workers came to the literacy school.
　　After the workers were able to come to school regularly, at first, Old Cong still told stories about the War of Resistance. Later, he wrote the titles of the stories on the blackboard, and slowly, he transformed storytelling into teaching literacy. At the same time, the school also adopted the "literacy card" method that was popular in the literacy movement at the time, and put forward the slogan "Everyone is a teacher, everyone is a student, everyone should ask, regardless of age, everyone should be literate." After the guidance of storytelling and the promotion of literacy cards, the workers began to learn to read. But they had not yet clearly felt the pain of illiteracy from the bottom of their hearts, and had not truly resolved to learn. Therefore, the school adopted the method of cultural grievance.
　　At a cultural grievance meeting, a sixty-year-old worker complained: "Before 'August 15th,' I came to Dalian from Shandong and lived in the home of a fellow villager, making a living by selling fish. Once I went to Bangchui Island to pick fish, because I was not familiar with the road, I entered the Japanese military fortress area. Although there was a sign there that said 'Military Important Area, No Entry,' I didn't know what it said. As a result, I was arrested by the military police, forced to kneel and beaten, and almost lost my life, and was finally released." Worker Li Shufeng said: In the past, because he was illiterate, he couldn't find anyone, he looked around, and was caught by the police as a thief and beaten until his head was bleeding. Through the grievance meetings, the workers realized the pain of illiteracy, and recalled the poor life before liberation when they could not get an education, and their class consciousness was also raised. After this, the illiterate people were determined to learn literacy, and the cultural workers were also determined to help the illiterate learn.
　　The students' enthusiasm for learning was improved, and they came to school to study every day, but they rarely considered how to improve their learning performance. In order to solve this problem, the school adopted the method of cartoon progress chart. The cartoons were divided into seven levels: airplane, train, car, bicycle, etc. According to the merits of the students' results after each monthly test, the students' names were written on wooden signs and hung next to the cartoons in order. The nameplates were replaced once a month. This greatly improved the students' enthusiasm for learning. This method was also used for cultural teachers. According to the average scores of each class and grade, they were divided into airplane class, ox cart class, etc., and they were also replaced once a month. This also played a great role in promoting the teachers. In order to achieve excellent results in their classes, the teachers also worked harder. Enthusiastic teaching. As a result, the monthly scores gradually increased. The average score of all students in July was 61 points, in August it was 69 points, and in September it rose to 77 points. At the same time, a strict examination system was established, with a small test every week and a big test every month, to urge students to study diligently.
　　In order to help students who were behind in their studies and make everyone's learning progress consistent, teacher Cong Longquan often went to see the students' learning situation even when it was not his turn to teach. Once he found that Yang Zhenbao's mood was not high during his studies. After work, he immediately had an individual conversation with him. During the conversation, he learned that Old Yang had to bring groceries home every day, and if he went home late, he would not be able to buy groceries, so he was not at ease in his studies. Old Cong came up with a solution for him: let him buy the groceries during his lunch break every day and take them home in the evening. Old Yang had no more worries and worked harder in his studies. By November of last year, he had learned more than 1,000 characters. Hou Zhengying was one of the poorer students. Old Cong was afraid that he would fall behind, so he often taught him individually after school. In ten months, he also learned more than 400 characters.
　　In teaching, the teachers of the school used the methods of enlightenment and guidance. For example, when teacher Old Cong taught Hou Zhengying to recognize the character "warm" (暖), he asked: When is it warm? Hou Zhengying said: When the sun comes out. Then Old Cong explained to him: Because it is warm when there is sun, so there is the character "sun" (日) next to the character "warm." After teaching it once like this, Old Hou never forgot the character "warm" again. When lecturing, he used the method of telling stories, combined with simple content that was easy for students to accept. When teaching literacy, he explained the usage in detail, and then let the students write according to it, and read it repeatedly. In order to prevent students from not being able to digest the lessons they had learned well and the phenomenon of separation of learning and use, it was proposed: Repeatedly practice writing characters, read the text fluently, and practice rewriting the text. Each character must be written more than ten times. Using the above methods, very good results were obtained. In particular, practicing rewriting the text laid a considerable foundation for the students in learning to write wall newspapers and write letters.

　　一个工人识字学校
    去年三月以前，旅大识字学校码头第五分校曾经开课三次，垮台三次。这一方面是由于该校三分之二的学员都是四十岁以上的人，对识字都表现很少信心，一方面也是由于领导上缺乏办识字学校的经验。但是，工会干部并没有因此灰心，他们再接再厉，终于把学校办了起来，使大批的码头工人得以开始其新的文化生活。到去年十一月间，这座学校已经获得了极大的成绩。全校百分之七十的学员（八十四人）完成并超过了全年识七百字的计划。三十六名四十五岁以上的老年学员，也识了三百到五百字。很多学员已能看职工报，给壁报写文章，写信。五十九岁的老工友林熙山不仅能写家信，并且能替邻居写信了。当去年十一月旅大全区进行识字运动奖模时，五分校荣膺“特等模范识字学校”的称号。该校出现了特等模范教师一人，二等模范学员七人，三等模范学员十一人。
    这座基础本来不怎么好的学校，为什么能够变成为一座特等模范学校呢？这是与工会的领导、教师的努力分不开的。
    最初，当发现一般工人对识字表现没有信心的时候，工会便确定首先从打通工人这一思想入手。教师丛龙泉深入到工人中间，进行耐心的说服工作。他曾听到老工友张成发这样说过：“土埋半截的人了，还学个什么劲儿！小时没捞着学习，现在老了，不行了！”他听了之后，就对张成发说：“就是因为从小没捞着学习，现在才要好好学习。现在的学习跟我们小时的学习不一样，不是学‘三字经’，要费很大的劲儿，学完了还没有什么用处。现在的学习不但比以前容易，而且学了就有用。人老，手不大听使唤，那不要紧，日子长了就好了。你天天来学习罢，我教给你，你学学看。”他又经常给工友们讲抗战故事。由于他讲的生动、通俗，合乎工友的口味，很快便在工友中建立了威信。工友把他叫成“说书的”。他瞅准了这种情况，便说：“既然大家爱听我说书，就请到识字学校里来吧！”这样，工友都到识字学校来了。
    当工友们已能经常到校以后，起先，老丛仍是讲抗战故事。后来，就把故事的题目写在黑板上，慢慢地，把讲故事变成为教识字。同时学校里又采用了当时在识字运动中流行的“识字牌”的方法，提出了“人人是先生，人人是学生，人人要问，不论老少，人人要识字”的口号。经过讲故事的引导，识字牌的推动，工友们开始学识字了。但还没有清楚地从内心体会到不识字的痛苦，还没有真正下决心来学习。于是，学校就采取了文化诉苦的办法。
    在一次文化诉苦会上，一位六十岁的老工友诉说着：“‘八一五’前，我由山东来到大连，借住在同乡家，靠卖鱼维持生活。有一次到棒槌岛去挑鱼，因为路不熟，走入了日本人的军事要塞地里。那里虽然有个牌写着‘军事重地，禁止通行’，但我不知道它上面写的什么。结果被宪兵抓去，罚跪挨打，险些送了命，好容易才放了出来。”工友李树风说：过去由于不识字，找个人也找不着，东看看西看看，被警察当成小偷，抓去打得头破血流。通过诉苦会，工友们体会到了不识字的痛苦，并回忆起解放前捞不着学习的贫苦生活，阶级觉悟也提高了。此后文盲们下决心要学识字，有文化的工友们，也下决心帮助文盲学习。
    学员的学习情绪提高了，天天来校学习，但他们很少考虑到用什么办法把学习成绩提高。为了解决这一问题，学校便采用了漫画进度表的办法。漫画分飞机、火车、汽车、脚踏车等七级。根据每月测验后学员成绩的优劣，将学员名字写在木牌上，依次挂在漫画旁边。每月测验一次，名牌也更换一次。这样大大提高了学员的学习热情。对文化教员也使用了这个办法，根据各班、各年级的考试平均分数分出飞机班、牛车班等等，也是每月更换一次。这对教师也起了很大的推动作用。教师们为了使本班获得优良成绩，也就加倍努力。热心教学。结果每月成绩逐渐上升。七月份全部学员的平均分数是六十一分，八月份是六十九分，九月份就升到了七十七分。同时，并建立了严格的考试制度，每星期一小考，每月一大考，督促学员经常用心学习。
    为了帮助学习落后的学员，使大家的学习进度趋于一致，教师丛龙泉当不该自己上课的时候，也经常去看学员学习的情形。有一次他发现杨振宝在学习当中情绪不高。下班后马上找他作个别谈话，谈话中知道老杨每天回家时要捎带着买菜，回去晚了就不能买菜了，所以在学习中不安心。老丛给他想出了办法：让他在每天中午休息的时候就把菜买好，晚上捎回去。老杨没了顾虑，学习很加劲，到去年十一月，已识了一千多个字。侯正英是学习较差的一个，老丛怕他落后，常在学完后个别教他，十个月中，也学会了四百多个字。
    在教学上，该校教员运用了启发、诱导的方法。如教员老丛教侯正英认“暖”字的时候，就问：什么时候暖和？侯正英说：出来日头的时候。接着老丛就给他解释：因为有了日头就暖和，所以“暖”字旁边有个“日”字。这么教了一次，老侯对“暖”字再也没有忘记。讲课的时候，是用讲故事的方式，配合上简单的、学员容易接受的内容。教识字，就详细说明用法，然后让学员照着写，并反复朗读。为了防止学员对学过的功课不能很好消化及学与用脱节的现象，提出：反复练习写字，要熟读课文，练习改写课文。每教一个字要写十遍以上。用以上各种方法，获得了很好的效果。特别是练习改写课文，给学员在学写壁报和写信上打下了相当的基础。
