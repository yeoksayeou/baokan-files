　　[Beijing News] People from all walks of life in the capital have expressed their satisfaction with the various municipal measures implemented since liberation a year ago. They believe that under the leadership of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Beijing Municipal People's Government, significant achievements have been made in political, economic, cultural, and educational construction. In addition to expressing their gratitude, they have also put forward some constructive opinions on the work.
    Zhang Dezhi, a worker at the New Beijing Printing Factory, said: "There have been so many benefits for us since liberation a year ago. Before liberation, the wages I earned each day weren't even enough to eat. Now, all three of us in my family have jobs, and there are no problems with our livelihood. In the factory, we can offer opinions to the factory management, and we can also study. We can even watch a movie once a month and take a bath twice a month."
    Lu Fengjun, a clerk at Yixinghou Cloth Shop, and Liu Yanming, a clerk at Dejuyong Grain Store, and others believe: "Speculation and profiteering, bullying, and reckless behavior have decreased; brothels have been closed, gambling is strictly prohibited, robbery cases are rare, and beggars are almost nowhere to be seen. I never thought that things would change so quickly in a year. Now everyone is honest and upright." They feel that the People's Government taxes fairly and handles matters quickly. The state-owned stores conduct business fairly, but some procedures are too troublesome. For example, buying cloth at the China National Cotton, Yarn and Cloth Corporation can take four or five hours.
    Zhou Zhongfei, a staff member of Juxingcheng Bank, told reporters: "Since liberation, luxury goods have been greatly reduced, but the government's plans and controls over the production of necessities are not enough. There are many different brands of goods, and the quality urgently needs to be improved." He also praised the work style of Peng Zhen, Secretary of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the CCP, for caring about people's lives and humbly accepting people's opinions, such as correcting the tendency of assigning quotas in the disaster relief fundraising in the Eighth District last October.
    Jiang Pu, a shareholder of Tianzeng Flour Mill, said: "In the year since liberation, fewer people are willing to be idle and do nothing. People feel uneasy and dishonorable if they don't work. I myself am like that." He also said that citizens are gradually becoming more concerned about politics. In addition, he believes that the marked prices in markets and small stalls are a step forward. Lawyer Liu Jingrong was very afraid of the Communist Party before liberation due to the Kuomintang's reactionary propaganda. When liberation came, he thought that China was finished, and no one could fix it. After a year, he changed his view of the Communist Party. He said: "Now I feel that China cannot become rich and strong without relying on the Communist Party. The Communist Party's spirit of humbly learning, working hard, and being simple, and its policies of thinking of the people in everything, can guarantee the successful construction of a new China."
    Zhao Longxiang, a lecturer at Peking University, said: "In the past year, the social atmosphere in Beijing has generally advocated thrift, and salaried people have the freedom to be free from the fear of hunger, while before liberation there was no guarantee." But he believes that some cadres in the government still have a rural work style and do not keep to schedules, and he hopes that they will pay attention to overcoming this.
    Wang Youxian, an elementary school teacher, feels that the first difference from before liberation is that now the people in our government are willing to humbly listen to and inquire about the opinions of the citizens; another major event is that we have recovered the barrack land forcibly occupied by imperialism, and you can walk around Dongjiaomin Lane freely, and you are no longer oppressed by imperialism.
    Citizen Bai Yuanqi feels that the police are now responsible and active, and there are fewer fights and quarrels on the streets, which is a great improvement in order compared to the Kuomintang rule.

　　首都各界人民发表感想
    盛赞一年来市政措施
    积极对工作提出建设性意见
    【北京讯】首都各界人民对解放一年来的各项市政措施纷纷发表谈话，表示满意。认为在中国共产党北京市委会和北京市人民政府的领导下，政治、经济和文化教育建设各方面都获得了很大的成绩，除表示感激外，并对工作提出了一些建设性的意见。
    新北京印刷厂工人张德志说：解放一年，对我们的好处太多了，解放前，每天所得工钱还不够一天吃；现在我们爷儿三个都有了工作，生活没问题了。在工厂我们可以向厂方提意见，也能学习，每月还能看一次电影，洗两次澡。
    益兴厚布庄店员路凤均、德聚涌粮食店店员柳延铭等认为：现在投机倒把、仗势欺人、胡作胡为的人减少了；妓院封闭，禁赌很严，抢案很少，乞丐几乎看不到了，真没想到一年来转变得这样快。现在每个人都老老实实变得正派了。他们觉得：人民政府征税公平，办事快。公营商店买卖公平，但有的手续太麻烦，如到花纱布公司买一次布要耽误四、五个钟头。
    聚兴诚银行职员周仲斐对记者表示：解放后，奢侈品大大减少了，但政府对生活必需品生产的计划与管制还不够，各种牌子的货出的很多，质量急需提高。他并盛赞中共市委书记彭真关心人民生活、虚心接受人民意见的作风，如去年十月间曾纠正第八区救灾募捐中发生摊派的偏向。
    天增面粉厂股东姜朴说：解放一年来愿意闲着不作事的人少了，不作事心里不安，不体面，我自己就是这样。他又说，市民对政治渐渐关心了，此外，他还认为市场和小市摆摊的明码标价是一个进步。律师刘景荣解放前因受国民党反动宣传很害怕共产党，刚解放时，又认为中国已经坏了，谁来也不成；经过了一年，他改变了对共产党的看法，他说：现在我觉得非依靠共产党不能使中国富强。共产党人虚心学习、刻苦朴素的作风和处处为人民着想的政策，可以保证建设新中国成功。
    北大讲师赵隆襄说：一年来北京的社会风气一般崇尚俭朴，薪给阶层都有了免于饥饿恐惧的自由，而解放前则是毫无保障的。但他认为有些机关干部办事还有农村作风，不遵守时刻，希望能注意克服。
    小学教员王有贤觉得第一个与解放前不同的是：现在我们政府的人肯虚心的听取和探询市民的意见；再有一件大事，就是我们已收回了帝国主义强占的兵营地产，东交民巷可以随便走，再不受帝国主义的压迫了。
    市民白元奇觉得：现在警察负责积极，街上打架的、吵嘴的变得少了，比国民党统治时秩序大大改进了。
