　　We Were Used as Frostbite Experiment Subjects
　　Fang Ying
　　Regarding the towering crimes of Japanese imperialism in manufacturing bacteria to harm the Chinese people, I believe that many people who lived in Northeast China during the period of Japanese puppet rule can provide a great deal of conclusive evidence. The following is a fact that I personally witnessed.
　　I remember in the summer of 1942, when I was studying in a middle school in Northeast China under Japanese puppet rule, the school asked the students for blood powder and animal hides with fur. To this end, the Japanese teacher in the school gave us several special lessons, explaining how to make blood powder into blocks, and how to nail the fur-bearing animal skins on wooden boards, etc. He pretended that it was for making some kind of "chemical raw materials" or "radio equipment." Although the students did not believe his nonsense, no one dared to ask deeply and felt puzzled. Only today did I suddenly realize that it was originally used to cultivate bacteria, to do the murderous deeds of slaughtering mankind!
　　That winter, one day, the Japanese in the school forced the students to take off their shirts in the outdoor environment of minus 30 degrees Celsius and exercise in the snow to build up their cold resistance. At this time, a group of medical personnel from the Kwantung Army came and said they were going to do some kind of "anti-freeze experiment," and most of the students were used as experimental subjects. They brought a special refrigerator, about two feet long and one foot wide, with many round holes drilled in the lid. First, they wrapped wires around the fingers of the person being experimented on, and then applied a layer of transparent ointment; then, they ordered everyone to insert their fingers into the round holes of the refrigerator; then, they connected the wires wrapped around their fingers to another machine with a turntable. They turned the turntable in turn, and your fingers felt a piercing pain, to the point of complete numbness. They asked you how you felt on time and filled in symbols on a form. The experiment lasted about 30 minutes, and the fingers taken out had turned into a stiff white color. At the time, none of us knew what this experiment was for. Recently, the confession of bacterial warfare criminals in the Beria trial mentioned that the Japanese invaders, in an attempt to invade the Soviet Union, used special refrigerators to force Chinese people to experiment with frostbite, even freezing them to death. This made me realize that the experiment they did on us was of the same kind. Although the persecution we suffered was relatively minor, it is a strong proof of this bloody atrocity.

### 我们作过冻伤试验品

　　我们作过冻伤试验品
    方英
    关于日本帝国主义者制造细菌残害中国人民的滔天罪恶，我想，曾在日伪统治时的东北居住过的许多人，都会举出很多确凿的证据来的。以下便是我所身经目睹的事实。
    记得一九四二年夏天，我正在日伪统治下东北的一个中学里念书，学校曾向同学们要过血粉和带毛的兽皮。为此，校内的日本教师对我们上了几堂专门课，讲解怎样把血粉制成块状，怎样把带毛的兽皮钉在木板上等方法。他佯言那是做什么“化学原料”、“电波器材”使用的。虽然同学们都不相信他的鬼话，但谁也不敢深问而感到莫明其妙。直到今天，我才恍然明白那原是他们用来培植细菌，做那屠杀人类的勾当的！
    那年冬季，有一天，学校里的日本人又迫令学生在零下三十几度的户外脱光上衣，在雪地里锻炼耐寒。就在这时，关东军部派来了一批军医人员，说要做什么“防冻实验”，大部分的同学都被做了实验品。他们带来一种长二尺宽尺许、盖子上钻有许多圆孔的特制冰箱。首先他们把被实验的人手指上缠以电线，再涂抹一层透明的软膏；然后命令大家把手指插进冰箱的圆孔；接着他们把缠在手指上的电线连结在另一个带转盘的机器上。他们依次转动转盘，你的手指便感到刺骨奇疼，以至完全麻木。他们按时问你感觉如何，在一张表上填写着符号。实验历时约三十分钟，拿出来的手指已变成僵死的白色了。对于他们这种实验，当时我们谁也不知道到底是为了什么。最近报载伯力审判细菌战犯的供词中，提到日寇为了企图侵略苏联，使用特制冰箱强迫中国人实验冻伤，竟至冻死，才使我知道他们对我们所做的实验，实是与此同属一类的。虽然我们所受的迫害比较轻微，但对这血腥的暴行却是一个力证。
