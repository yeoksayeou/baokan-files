Beware of Landlords' Tricks for Transferring Land
　　Duānmù Hòngliáng

    In the land reform work in the suburbs of Beijing, it can be seen that the landlords had made preparations in advance and adopted various clever and cunning methods to evade or sabotage the land reform. Some deceived peasants by registering their land under the names of peasants; some won over the masses, making it difficult for the work team to understand the real situation among the masses, or sent lackeys to monitor the speeches of the masses at group meetings; some even bought off agricultural association cadres to monitor the activities of the work team and secretly manipulate the village government.

    The conspiracy of Zhang Guangzhi, a landlord in the natural village of Jide Tang, to cleverly transfer his land can be said to be a typical example.

    Zhang Guangzhi used to run a cloth shop in Beijing. In 1947, he came to live on Jingbei Road, Nan Yuan, and managed seven *qing* of land in Jide Tang—part of which was his own; he acted as a secondary landlord. In June 1949, when he learned about the Communist Party's land policy, he changed his method and sold one *qing* of land: 40 *mu* to Zhang Yuling, 20 *mu* to Liu Jizeng, 20 *mu* to Fu Hai, and 20 *mu* to Dong Yiheng.

    This *qing* of land was actually sold in June 1949, but the contract was written as 1948. At the same time, fearing exposure of his name, he fraudulently used Wu Daozhen's old contract. Assuming Wu Daozhen were still alive, he would now be at least over two hundred years old. In this way, he had already thrown two handfuls of blinding sand, but this was not yet considered remarkable.

    In addition, he changed two more tricks: first, he did not write the land price, but asked the buyer to write an IOU converting it into corn, but the IOU was also written as the fifth day of the fifth lunar month in 1947. Second, the IOU did not include his own name, but the name of his wife's brother, Zhu Fanglan. At the same time, he even pre-added the interest, hiding his exploitative tricks inside.

    Zhang Guangzhi's method of transferring land can be said to be the most confidential and thorough. He used someone else's old contract, the name was not his, so he could avoid nominal responsibility before the people's law. The time of the contract was also pushed up a year, indicating that he transferred the land use rights before liberation. He did not write the sale price, but wrote an IOU, and used his wife's brother to take the blame, while he used the guarantor's name to demand debts, avoiding the crime of transferring land and sabotaging land reform. It can be seen that he had planned and systematically arranged this. If the work team did not carefully grasp the situation, it would be difficult to expose his despicable methods.

    Now, let's copy the land contract and IOU of one of the four deceived farmers, Liu Jizeng, as follows:

    Contract:
    Writer of the sale contract Wu Daozhen (note: died more than a hundred years ago), now in need of funds, will sell a section of land east and west of Jidetang Village under his name, counting twenty *mu*. Now I entrust the intermediary Huo Wenlin (note: a rich peasant tenant) to negotiate and make it clear that the price of each *mu* of land is equivalent to four *dou* of corn, and sell it to Liu Jizeng to be owned under Liu Jizeng's name, the four boundaries are unclear... IOU (one of them):
    Writer of the IOU Liu Jizeng, now borrowed eight *shi* of corn from Zhu Fanglan (note: Zhang Guangzhi's wife's brother), it is clear that it will be repaid by the fifteenth day of October. If there is any arrears, the guarantor will be responsible. For fear of verbal promises, this IOU is evidence.
                Guarantors: Zhang Guangzhi, Huo Wenlin
                May 5th, 36th Year of the Republic [1947]

    From this, we can see that the landlord's tricks are diverse. We expose this "chain" trick of transferring land to raise the awareness of the peasants and prevent them from being fooled by these landlords again.

　　当心地主转移土地的诡计
　　端木蕻良
    在北京郊区土地改革工作中，可以看出地主们事前都有了准备，采取了巧妙刁滑的各种手段来逃避或者破坏土地改革。有的欺骗农民，把自己的土地，分别登记在农民的名下；有的拉拢群众，使工作组在群众里难于了解真实情况，或派狗腿在小组会上监视群众发言；有的甚至收买农会干部，监视工作组的活动，以及暗中操纵村政权。
    济德堂自然村地主张广志巧妙的转移他的土地的阴谋，可以说是一个典型的例子。
    张广志以前在北京开布店，一九四七年来住南苑京北路，经管济德堂地七顷--有一部分是自己的，他做二地主。一九四九年六月，他知道了共产党土地政策，便变着方法卖出一顷地：张玉岭四十亩，刘济增二十亩，傅海二十亩，董以珩二十亩。
    这一顷地本来是一九四九年六月卖的，但是在契约上却写的是一九四八年。同时，他怕暴露出自己的名字，就冒用吴道箴的老契。假设吴道箴还活着，现在起码有二百多岁了。这样，他已经是撒了两把迷眼的沙子，但这还不算出奇。
    另外，他又变了两套戏法：第一，不写地价，却叫买主写借条折合玉米，可是借条却又写的是一九四七年五月初五日。第二，借条又不写他自己的名字，而写他妻舅朱方兰的名字。同时，他又连同利息都预先复加在里面，把他的鬼剥皮的伎俩，都藏盖在里边。
    张广志这种转移土地的方法，可以说是最机密，最周到，他用别人的老契，名字不是他的，这样，他可以避免在人民法律面前负名义上的责任。定契约的时间又往上推了一年，表示他是在解放以前转移土地使用权的。不写卖价，而写借条，又用他的妻舅来顶名，自己用保人名义来讨欠追债，避免转移土地破坏土改的罪名，可以看出他是有计划有步骤的布置下来的。假如工作组要不精细的掌握情况，很难揭破他这种卑污的手法。
    现在，我们再把四户被欺骗的农民里面的一个，刘济增的地契和借条照样的抄写在下面：
    契约：
    立卖约人吴道箴（按已死一百多年了），今乏用，将自业济德堂庄西下地东西地一段，计数二十亩。今托中人霍文林（按为佃富农）说合言明每亩地价合玉米四斗，出卖与刘济增与刘济增名下为业，四至不明……借条（其中的一张）：
    立借字人刘济增，今借到朱方兰（按为张广志妻舅）玉米八石，言明至十月十五日还清，如有拖欠，由中保人负责，恐口无凭，立字为证。
                中保人  张广志  霍文林
                民国三十六年五月初五日
    从这里，我们可以看出：地主的诡计是多样的。我们把这个转移土地“连环套”的诡计揭露出来，以提高农民的警觉性，不再上这些地主们的当。
