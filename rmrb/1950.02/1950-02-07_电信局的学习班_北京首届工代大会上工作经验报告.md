　　The Telecommunications Bureau's Study Class
    ——Work Experience Report from the First Beijing Workers' Congress

    [Beijing News] At the Beijing Municipal Workers' Congress, a representative from the Beijing Telecommunications Bureau reported on the work experience of the Beijing Telecommunications Bureau's study class. The full text is as follows:

    The majority of employees at the Beijing Telecommunications Bureau have a relatively high level of education. However, due to the long-term rule and deceptive propaganda of the Kuomintang reactionaries, they more or less harbored some muddled thinking and misconceptions. In order to raise their class consciousness, instill in them a correct outlook on life, and give them a preliminary understanding of the Chinese revolution and the world situation, and to encourage them to actively participate in the construction of the people's capital, the Telecommunications Bureau began running employee study classes in April of last year. Up until November, a total of five sessions were held, with a total of 1,590 employees participating (including 111 from the Tianjin, Zhangjiakou, and Baoding Telecommunications Bureaus). Among the students were 1,125 workers and 461 staff members. Their educational levels were: 178 with university degrees and returned students, 421 with high school degrees, 556 with junior high school degrees, 243 with higher elementary school degrees, 172 with lower elementary school degrees, and 20 who had attended private schools or were illiterate. Based on the students' political awareness, ideological level, and educational background, the study class curriculum was designed to focus primarily on historical materialism and the basic problems of the Chinese revolution, supplemented by land reform, trade union work, and current affairs.

    The study class learning method combined large lectures with small group discussions. After listening to the reports, questions and discussion outlines were presented for small group discussion. During the discussions, students were encouraged to reflect on their past and present thoughts and behaviors, and to appropriately use criticism and self-criticism to examine their thinking.

  Several Important Gains

    After studying in the study class, the employees of the Telecommunications Bureau made great progress in their political awareness and ideological understanding:

    I. A preliminary establishment of a labor viewpoint and a mass viewpoint. Before studying, there was a general disregard for labor and the working people. Some people disliked seeing working people. They believed that intellectuals created everything, were arrogant and complacent, did not believe in the power of the masses, and were even less willing to learn from the masses. For example, one telegraph operator in the past was unwilling to sit with working people in movie theaters or other public places. Some workers also looked down on themselves and on labor, thinking that the reason they were oppressed everywhere was "because they were manual laborers," and envied those who did not "exert physical effort." In terms of the mass viewpoint, workers were generally stronger than intellectuals. After studying, most people had a more correct understanding of the mass viewpoint and understood that the power of the masses is infinite. For example, after the lecture on historical materialism, each district team initiated labor challenges to clean up the courtyard, repair the horse barriers, and pull weeds. Intellectual technical personnel actively participated. Guo Yinqi, an old technician of fifty-eight, also participated despite his illness. He said, "I used to be afraid of getting dirty, but now I am not afraid."

    II. Preliminary establishment of the concept of serving the people. After clarifying their position, most people began to realize that they should not simply work for "millet." At the conclusion of the study class, the students launched challenges to strive to be models in trade union work and production work. In the graduation ceremony and the wall posters they wrote, many students vowed: "I must step up production and wholeheartedly serve the people." For example, one student wrote very sincerely in his study summary: "When I was hired as a cadre, I felt that my heart was willing but my strength was insufficient. Rather than doing a bad job and being scolded, I would rather not do it, so I firmly resigned... Now the second committee has been formed, and I have been hired as a women's work department cadre again. A change has taken place in my heart, and I feel very happy. Thinking that I was not responsible last time, I should take responsibility again this time and do a good job of serving the people." In production positions, most people were able to abide by labor discipline and changed the ideological style of doing only as much as they were paid to do. At the same time, many people participated in trade union work.

    III. Strengthening of the unity of employees. The employees of the Telecommunications Bureau are scattered in all directions. At the same time, due to differences in technical nature, shift arrangements, and leadership relations, they formed a wide variety of unrelated groups. Before liberation, the reactionaries intentionally created disunity among the employees, dividing them into factions such as the Communications College, the Technical Training Institute, and the old Ministry of Communications. There were even differences between "those who flew in" and "those who crawled in." There was disunity among the employees. In the study class, everyone met sincerely, and small group life was very lively. Regardless of workers, staff, men, women, old or young, everyone studied, discussed, criticized, and played together, and the feelings were very good. At graduation, everyone was reluctant to part. Especially in the fifth study class, because there were students from other places (Zhangjiakou, Baoding, and Tianjin Telecommunications Bureaus), the Beijing students went to the station to see them off at graduation. Everyone held hands and shouted slogans, and many people said, "The classmates in the group are closer than my parents and siblings," "I tasted the true love of life for the first time."

    Several Key Experiences and Lessons

    I. The reason why the Telecommunications Bureau's study class was able to achieve such results is primarily due to the close cooperation of the Party, government, trade union, and Youth League. The Party, government, trade union, and Youth League of the Telecommunications Bureau all attached great importance to the study class. The Party and Youth League designated cadres specifically to do study work. Each session was also equipped with many Party and Youth League members to lead the study, ensuring the completion of the study tasks. The administrative responsible persons also tried to squeeze out time from their busy schedules to give lectures. The preparatory committee of the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions also provided assistance. All of this is the most basic condition for running a good study class.

    II. Some detours were taken in the work of transferring and training students. The first group of students was designated by the administration, which aroused dissatisfaction among the employees. Some said, "Who should go and who shouldn't go? What are the standards?" "Look! They went to study, and we don't have a share." The second session accepted the experience of the first session and changed to having the grassroots groups of the trade union recommend based on some conditions designated by the trade union (active in learning, able to play the role of a small teacher, etc.), self-reporting and public discussion. This not only combined with voluntariness, but also gave him a certain mission in the unit, asking him to play the role of a small teacher after returning from study. Some units held a farewell party when the students left the class and a welcome party when they returned, encouraging the students' learning enthusiasm and increasing their sense of responsibility, and the unity of the employees became closer.

    III. The division of groups must take into account the level of education. If the difference in education level is too great, it is difficult to discuss; at the same time, gender, age, staff and workers should also be appropriately divided together, so that the discussion is more enthusiastic, and the effect of mutual transformation and exchange of experience can be achieved. The heads of each department should be assigned to each group according to the nature of the work, so that the old misunderstandings between superiors and subordinates can be broken, and at the same time, they can understand each other and reconcile their feelings, which will be of great help to future work.

    IV. Lectures must be tailored to the students' thinking, linked to the actual situation of the department, cite specific examples that everyone is familiar with, and go deep into simple terms with emphasis.

    V. The leadership must grasp the students' learning emotions. For example, at the beginning of the first session, the students did not feel interested in learning and regarded learning as a burden. At this time, the study class must first correct the students' errors in their understanding of learning. Only by timely correcting the students' bias in their understanding of learning and improving their learning enthusiasm can we talk about real learning. But the situation was different in the fourth and fifth sessions. Due to the unprecedentedly rapid victorious development of the revolutionary situation, and after short-term study classes and trade union group studies, the students' learning enthusiasm was particularly high. At this time, we should seize this favorable condition and carry out learning. In the fourth study class, learning suffered some losses because it failed to grasp the students' emotions.

    VI. The study group leader is the most basic leader of the study class, and small group discussions rely on the leadership of the group leader. The students come from different units and are not familiar with each other. They often make the mistake of having some self-esteem and face-saving problems. At the beginning of the discussion, it is always not enthusiastic enough, not universal and in-depth, so the group leader is best to be taken by people with more learning experience.

    VII. Pay attention to organizing the employees who have returned from study, so that they can truly play the role of small teachers and core roles. In the past, we did not pay attention to this work, and as a result, the emotions of some students were very high as soon as they came back, but slowly declined.

　　电信局的学习班
    ——北京首届工代大会上工作经验报告
    【北京讯】在京市工人代表大会中，北京电信局代表报告北京电信局学习班的工作经验，全文如下：
    北京电信局绝大多数职工的文化程度都比较高，但由于国民党反动派的长期统治与欺骗宣传，或多或少的都存在着一些糊涂思想和错误认识。电信局为了提高他们的阶级觉悟，使他们树立起正确的人生观，并初步认识中国革命和世界形势，积极参加人民首都的建设工作，于去年四月间开始办理职工学习班。直到十一月止，共办了五期，共有职工一千五百九十人参加学习（内有天津、张家口、保定电信局一百一十一人）。学员中有工人一千一百二十五人，职员四百六十一人。文化程度是：大学和留学生一百七十八人，高中程度四百二十一人，初中程度五百五十六人，高小程度二百四十三人，初小程度一百七十二人，上过私塾的和文盲二十人。学习班根据学员的政治认识、思想水平和文化程度等情况，规定课程的内容是：基本上以唯物史观和中国革命基本问题为主，土地改革、工会工作和时事问题等为辅。
    学习班的学习方法是采取讲大课与小组讨论相结合的方式。听完报告后，提出问题与讨论提纲，由小组讨论。在讨论中，联系自己过去和现在的思想行为，适当地运用批评与自我批评的方法，检讨自己的思想。
  几项重要收获
    经过了学习班学习后，电信局的职工们在政治觉悟和思想认识方面有了很大的进步：
    一、初步的树立了劳动观点和群众观点。在学习以前一般的对劳动和劳动人民都是轻视的，有些人见了劳动人民就讨厌。认为知识分子创造一切，自高自大，不相信群众力量，更不肯向群众学习。例如有一位报务员，过去在电影院或其他公共场所，不愿和劳动人民坐在一起。工人中也有一部分轻视自己，轻视劳动，以为自己处处受压迫的原因是“因为自己是卖力气的”，羡慕那些不“卖力气”的人。在群众观点方面，一般地是工人比知识分子强。经过学习之后，大部分人对群众观点有了比较正确的认识，明白群众的力量是无穷的。如讲完唯物史观以后，各区队发起劳动挑战，收拾院子、修理马闸、拔草，知识分子的技术人员都积极参加。五十八岁的老技术员郭引祺也带病参加，他说：“以前怕脏，现在我不怕了”。
    二、初步树立了为人民服务的观点。大部分在明确了自己的立场以后，就开始认识了不应该是单纯为“小米”而工作了。在学习班结业时，学员们都发起了挑战，争取在工会工作中，生产工作中作模范。在毕业典礼和写的壁报文章中，很多同学都立誓：“我一定要加紧生产，全心全意为人民服务。”又如有的学员在学习总结中非常诚恳地写着：“当我被聘为干事时，感觉心有余而力不足，与其作不好挨骂，不如不去作，便坚决地辞了……。现在第二届委员又产生了，我又被聘为女工部干事，在心里就起了变化，觉得很高兴，想到上次没有负责，这次有了这样的任务，应重新负起责任来，好好的为人民服务干下去”。在生产岗位上，一般的都能遵守劳动纪律，改变了过去给多少钱干多少事的思想作风。同时很多人都参加了工会工作。
    三、加强了职工的团结。电信局的职工是散布在四面八方的。同时又由于技术性质、班务关系和领导关系的不同，形成了五花八门，各不相关。在解放前，反动派更有意的造成职工内部的不团结，在派系上有通信学院、技训所、老交通部之分。更有什么“飞来的”、“爬来的”不同。职工内部是不团结的。在学习班中，大家真诚相见，小组生活过得很活泼。不分工人职员与男女老幼，大家在一起学习、讨论、批评、游戏，感情非常好，在毕业时大家恋恋不舍。特别是第五期学习班因有外地的学员（张家口、保定和天津电信局），在毕业时，北京同学到车站去欢送他们，大家拉着手，喊着口号，有很多人说：“小组的同学比我的父母兄弟还亲”，“我第一次尝到人生真正爱的滋味”。
    几点主要的经验和教训
    一、电信局学习班所以能够有这样的成绩，首先是党、政、工、团密切配合工作的结果。电信局党、政、工、团对学习班都非常重视。党、团指定干部专门作学习工作。每期又配备很多党、团员领导学习，保证学习任务完成。行政负责人员也都于百忙中设法挤出时间来给讲课。市总工会筹委会也予以协助。这一切都是办好学习班的最基本的条件。
    二、在调训学员工作上是走了一些弯路的。第一期学员是由行政指定，因而引起职工们的不满，有的说：“谁该去谁不该去呢？有什么标准”，“瞧！人家学习去了，没有咱们的份”。第二期接受了第一期的经验，改由工会基层小组依工会指定的一些条件（学习积极、能起小先生作用等）推选，自报公议。这样不但与志愿相结合，同时单位中还给他一定的使命，要他学习回来以后起小先生作用。有的单位在学员离班时举行欢送会，回来时举行欢迎会，鼓励了学员们的学习情绪，加重了他们的责任心，职工们的团结也更加紧密了。
    三、划分小组时一定要照顾到文化程度。假如文化程度悬殊太大，讨论起来很困难；同时性别、年龄、职员和工人也要适当分在一起，这样讨论时才热烈，又可收到互相改造和交流经验的效果。各部门的主管人员应依工作性质分配到各组去，这样既可打破上下级间的旧的错误认识，同时又可互相了解，融洽感情，对以后的工作有很大帮助。
    四、讲课一定要针对学员们的思想情况，联系本部门的实际情况，举大家熟悉的具体例子，有重点的深入浅出。
    五、领导上一定要掌握学员们的学习情绪。如第一期开始时学员们对学习不感觉兴趣，把学习看成负担。这时，学习班首先要纠正学员对学习认识上的错误，只有及时纠正了学员们对学习认识上的偏向，提高了学习情绪以后，才能谈到真正的学习。但到第四、五期则不然了，由于革命形势空前迅速的胜利发展，和经过短期学习班和工会小组的学习，学员们的学习情绪特别高，这时就应该抓紧这一有利条件，开展学习。在第四期学习班因为没能掌握学员们这种情绪，使学习受了一些损失。
    六、学习小组长是学习班最基层的领导者，小组讨论要靠小组长领导。学员们来自不同的单位，彼此并不熟悉，又常犯着一些自尊心好面子的毛病，开始讨论时，总是不够热烈，不普遍和深入，所以小组长最好是由比较有学习经验的人来担任。
    七、要注意组织学习回来的职工，使他们真能发挥小先生和核心作用。以前没有注意这件工作，结果使得一部分学员，刚一回来情绪很高，结果慢慢的消沉下去。
