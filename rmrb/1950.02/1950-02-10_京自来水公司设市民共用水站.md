　　Beijing Water Company
    Establishes Public Water Stations for Citizens
    [Beijing News] In order to make tap water available to citizens who cannot install private pipes, the Beijing Water Company plans to establish 200 public water stations in various areas of the city this year. Citizens in various districts who wish to use tap water can jointly elect a responsible representative to apply to the company's business section for the installation of a public water station. If the location is close to the water distribution pipe, all labor and material costs can be fully borne by the company. The company has now completed four water supply stations, including the one at the north entrance of Zhongjian Fu Chang Street, Hufangqiao, and has begun supplying water. Each district has selected persons in charge of managing the public water stations, and fifteen are preparing for installation. The municipal government believes that the company's work in establishing public water stations in various parts of the city is very necessary and has ordered the Municipal Public Security Bureau and the district public offices to assist in the process.
