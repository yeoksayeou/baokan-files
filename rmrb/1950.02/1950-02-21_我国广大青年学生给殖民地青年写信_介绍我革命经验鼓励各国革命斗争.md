Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, February 20th: To commemorate February 21st, "Day of Struggle Against the Colonial System," the broad masses of Chinese youth, students, members of the Youth League, as well as youth and student organizations, have been writing letters to the youth of various colonial and semi-colonial countries, filled with the concern and encouragement of Chinese youth for the struggle of the youth of colonial and semi-colonial countries for national independence. Many young people have introduced the experience of the Chinese revolution in their letters, pointing out that revolutionary armed struggle, the leadership of the Communist Party, and a strong anti-imperialist united front are the basic conditions for colonial and semi-colonial countries to achieve revolutionary victory. They also used the victory of the Chinese revolution to prove that American imperialism is a paper tiger, and as long as the youth and people of all countries persist in their struggle, they will surely achieve victory. Many letters also emphasized that the Soviet Union is the most loyal and reliable friend of colonial and semi-colonial countries. Some young people also wrote letters to express their sympathy to Chinese compatriots in various colonial and semi-colonial countries, encouraging them to form a united front with the local people against imperialism, in order to achieve their own common liberation with the local people. The letter writers include the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Youth League, the Preparatory Committee of the Beijing Democratic Youth Federation, the Beijing Student Federation, students and Youth League members from Peking University, Tsinghua University, and North China University, various youth organizations in Chahar Province, Youth League members and youth from Shijiazhuang Daxing Textile Factory, and Shijiazhuang Coking Plant, Youth League members from various units of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Government, the Preparatory Committee of the Northeast Youth League, the Northeast Student Federation, and the Industry Committee of the Rehe Provincial Youth League, and over a hundred other units.
