Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, February 5th. Why haven't a large number of former U.S. consulate personnel in our country withdrawn as ordered by the U.S. government? A spokesperson for our Foreign Ministry told reporters, "This question can only be answered by the U.S. State Department." The spokesperson said, "Although the U.S. government, on January 15th, used the pretext of our Beijing Military Control Commission reclaiming the U.S. barracks land to declare that it had ordered the recall of all 'official personnel' remaining in our country, attempting to use this to threaten our people, this time the U.S. government's actions are extraordinarily slower than its statements. To this day, the vast majority of former U.S. diplomatic personnel in China have not made a move. They have not yet applied to our government for exit permits, although our government is ready to approve their departure at any time. This seems to indicate that Washington has not actually made any decision to withdraw official personnel from China, as the State Department spokesperson claimed twenty days ago."

When asked about the truth of the Associated Press's Washington dispatch on the 25th, which stated that Acheson told the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee that our government was making it difficult for U.S. nationals to withdraw, the Foreign Ministry spokesperson said, "This is a complete fabrication. Our government not only will not prevent any U.S. official personnel and their families from leaving China, but on the contrary, based on the experience of the former U.S. consuls in Shenyang and Dihua engaging in espionage activities, we would rather hear that all U.S. official personnel could leave China more quickly. The former U.S. Assistant Military Attaché in Beijing, Paul Rupert, left Beijing on February 3rd, and the former U.S. Information Service Director, Van Bergen, was also allowed to leave Beijing on January 27th, but former U.S. consulate personnel in Beijing, Tianjin, and many other places remain silent to this day. Is it because the U.S. government anticipates that there will be a day in the future when it will have to ask our government to allow those officials who are now requesting to leave China to return to China, and therefore will lose face, and is secretly regretting its decision? In any case, in this matter, we have once again seen the U.S. imperialism's paper-tiger nature."

　　我外交部发言人告新华社记者
    美前外交人员迟迟未撤  再次证明美帝外强中干
    中国人民宁愿他们快快离境，但是他们撤退的行动却迟缓得出奇。
    【新华社北京五日电】大批的美国驻我国前领事馆人员为什么还没有按美国政府所宣布的命令从我国撤退呢？我国外交部发言人告诉记者说：“这个问题只有美国国务院才能够答复。”外交部发言人说：“虽然美国政府在一月十五日就借口我国北京市军事管制委员会收回美国兵营地产一事声称：已下令召回美国留在我国的一切‘官方人员’，企图借此威胁我国人民，但是这一次美国政府的行动却比它的声明迟缓得出奇。至今绝大多数美国留华前外交人员还没有动静。他们至今不向我国政府申请出境，虽然我国政府是随时都准备批准他们出境的。这似乎是表示华盛顿实在并没有作出什么撤退在华官方人员的决定，像国务院发言人在二十天以前所声称的那样。”
    在记者问起合众社华盛顿二十五日电所称艾奇逊对美国参议院外交委员会说我国政府留难美国侨民撤退一事的真相时，外交部发言人说：“这完全是捏造。我国政府不独不会阻止任何美国官方人员和他们的家属离开中国，相反，根据沈阳和迪化美国前领事从事间谍活动的经验，我们宁愿听到所有美国官方人员能够更快地离开中国。北京的前美国副武官鲍瑞德已于二月三日离京，前美国新闻处长范柏杰亦于上月二十七日获准离京，但北京、天津和其他许多地方的前美国领事馆人员至今仍然保持沉默。是不是美国政府设想到将来总会有一天又要请求我国政府准许那些今天请准离开中国的官员们返回中国，因而将要损失面子，便对自己的决定偷偷地后悔了呢？无论如何，在这件事情上，我们又一次地看到了美国帝国主义的外强中干”。
