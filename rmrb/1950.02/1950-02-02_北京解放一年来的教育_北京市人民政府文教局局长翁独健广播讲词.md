Beijing was once the center of reactionary rule for successive dynasties, and the broad masses of people and intellectuals were subjected to the influence and arbitrary deceptive propaganda of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism for a long time. On the other hand, it is also the birthplace of the new culture, and the broad masses of people and revolutionary intellectuals have a heroic revolutionary tradition. After liberation, under the leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, Beijing's education circles and the broad masses of intellectuals, following the workers and peasants, struggled to eliminate the remnants of the old education and ideology and build a new democratic cultural and educational cause in the people's capital. In the past year, thanks to the cooperation of all aspects of work, major changes have taken place in Beijing's education, mainly reflected in the following three aspects:
    First, the People's Government transferred the schools controlled by the Kuomintang reactionaries to the people and carried out preliminary reforms: (1) It took over all public primary and secondary schools, transforming and streamlining their huge bureaucratic structures (formerly the teaching affairs section, discipline section, general affairs section, and sports section) (re-establishing teaching and general affairs sections), establishing a democratic centralized system with the principal in charge and open finances, eliminating the Kuomintang's dictatorial and corrupt rule over education; (2) It implemented the integration of teaching and guidance and democratic life guidance, established a dedicated system and grade-level system, overcame the chaotic phenomena of anarchy and disorder, and universally established study groups, class meetings, and student unions, so that students' learning attitudes and ideological styles could be correctly developed and trained; (3) It abolished all reactionary courses, such as civics for middle schools, scout training, local administration for normal schools, local autonomy, and local construction, universally adding political classes, reducing English hours, and adding Russian; (4) It improved teaching materials: In middle schools, except for natural sciences which still used the old textbooks, the three subjects of politics, Chinese, and history have adopted newly compiled textbooks (compiled by the Education Department of the North China People's Government), and revisions and supplements have been made; In primary schools, all new textbooks compiled by the former Education Department of the North China People's Government have been adopted since the second semester of last year, and supplementary arithmetic textbooks, teaching outlines for history, and annotations for Chinese have been compiled for all levels; (5) In order to overcome the teaching methods that were divorced from reality in the past and create new teaching experiences, last year, 58 primary schools began to implement Chinese language observation teaching, with 85 demonstrators and 2,719 visitors. After mutual criticism, teachers' old-fashioned teaching methods that only emphasized technology and not viewpoints, only relied on subjectivity and did not consider the object, and simply instilled without inspiring were generally corrected; (6) It supported and rectified private middle schools, and provided financial subsidies to those with better management but financial difficulties; Counter-revolutionary private middle schools such as Zhicheng, Middle University Affiliated Middle School, Dazhong, Huitong, Dazhong, and Sicun were placed under trusteeship, merged, or closed down. In order to rectify private middle schools, the Education Bureau specially formulated the "Provisional Management Measures for Private Middle and Primary Schools" and the "Provisional Organizational Outline for the Board of Directors of Private Middle and Primary Schools." This has allowed private middle schools to gradually get on the right track.
    Second, political and ideological education was widely carried out. When we took over educational institutions, many teachers and students, because they had always been deceived and distorted by the Kuomintang reactionaries, harbored suspicion of the Communist Party and the People's Government, and had some misunderstandings about Sino-Soviet relations and land reform. In response to this ideological situation of teachers and students, the education authorities conducted extensive ideological and political education, the main purpose of which was to eliminate the erroneous ideas of teachers and students and establish a revolutionary outlook on life.
    The political education of students is mainly based on political classes, supplemented by summer youth academies, participation in labor, visits to Soviet construction photo exhibitions and other exhibitions, etc., so that students have undergone great changes in their thinking: (1) Generally accepted "labor creates the world" and recognized class struggle; (2) Have a basic understanding of the basic issue of the Chinese revolution, land reform; (3) From doubting the Communist Party to believing in the Communist Party, they generally recognized the three enemies and four friends; (4) On the international front, most can distinguish between the enemy and us, and recognize that the Soviet Union is our friend.
    The ideological transformation of teachers is mainly based on self-study, combined with report discussions, linking with reality, and initially using criticism and self-criticism. Before the summer vacation, under the leadership of the Education Bureau and the Education Union, 16 major reports on current affairs and policies were organized, and study groups were universally organized in various schools to study and discuss the basic issues of the Chinese revolution and current affairs policies. During the summer vacation, a study meeting of 5,800 people was organized, with historical materialism as the content of the study, focusing on solving the labor viewpoint and class viewpoint, so as to initially establish a revolutionary outlook on life. After the end of the summer vacation study, teacher's professional study meetings were organized, with professional study as the main focus, combined with political and ideological education, to further improve the political level of teachers.
    Third, the broad masses of working people have gained access to education. In the past year, adult literacy schools and children's literacy classes have been opened in large numbers in urban and suburban areas, and many people's education centers, libraries, and reading rooms have been rectified and increased, and many children of workers and peasants have been admitted to schools. In August of last year, there were 174 classes of workers' night schools with 10,392 participants (changed to the leadership of the trade union in September). By the end of December of last year, there were a total of 423 classes of adult night schools with 15,000 students. In order to cooperate with land reform, winter schools were universally organized in the suburbs, and 16,000 farmers participated in the study. Nine people's education centers, seven newspaper reading rooms, and two libraries were rectified and developed in urban and suburban areas, and symposiums, public lectures, exhibitions, and evening parties were often held, and the masses were helped to organize singing teams, Yangko teams, and drama groups. According to statistics in December, the number of readers in the eight urban museums throughout the year was 600,000, and the number of participants in evening parties was 110,000. There are a total of 658 children's literacy classes in the city with 20,026 students, and 15,000 out-of-school children of workers have been inserted into regular schools.
    This is the situation of education in Beijing one year after liberation. What do these situations indicate? It shows that the people of Beijing are striving to move forward on the road of building new democratic education. Beijing has made some achievements in education in the past year, but it is far from enough in terms of both qualitative improvement and quantitative development. In primary and secondary schools, some have not been rectified, and some have been rectified but have not yet gotten on the right track. Not much experience has been gained in transforming the old system, teaching methods, and teaching content. The combination of education and production is not enough. The number of working people receiving education is not large. Therefore, the educational policy of Beijing in 1950 should be: continue and strengthen political and ideological education, further improve and transform primary and secondary school education, expand and improve technical education and normal education, develop workers' and cadres' spare-time education, strengthen social education, consolidate and develop workers' night schools and adult night schools, begin to eliminate illiteracy and popularize science in a planned and step-by-step manner, open various short-term training courses, and train a large number of specialized technical talents, improve the cultural, political, scientific, and technical knowledge level of the broad masses of people in Beijing, especially the working people, and closely integrate with production and construction, so that Beijing will move towards becoming a production city. I hope that the education circles of Beijing will strive to take a big step forward in 1950.

　　北京解放一年来的教育
    ——北京市人民政府文教局局长翁独健广播讲词
    北京一方面曾是历代反动统治的中心，广大人民和知识分子长期受了帝国主义、封建主义、官僚资本主义的薰染和武断欺骗的宣传；另一方面，又是一个新文化的发祥地，广大的人民和革命知识分子，具有英勇斗争的革命传统。解放之后，北京的教育界及广大的知识分子，在共产党、毛主席领导下，跟随着工农劳动群众，为肃清旧的教育和思想残余，建设人民首都的新民主主义文化教育事业而奋斗。一年以来，由于各方面工作的配合，北京的教育发生了重大的变化，主要表现在下列三方面：
    第一，人民政府把国民党反动派控制的学校转到人民手中，并加以初步的改造：（１）接管了各公立中小学，把其庞大的官僚机构（分教务处、训育处、事务处、体育处）加以改造与精简（改设教导、总务两处），建立了校长负责的民主集中制和经济公开，扫除国民党在教育上的独裁贪污的统治；（２）实行了教导合一与民主生活指导，建立了专任制与级任制，克服了无政府无秩序的紊乱现象，普遍建立了学习小组，班会与学生会，使学生的学习态度，思想作风，得到正确的发展与锻炼；（３）废除了一切反动课程，如中学的公民，童子军训练，师范学校的地方行政，地方自治，地方建设等，普遍增设了政治课，减少英文钟点，增设俄文；（４）改进了教材：在中学方面，除自然科学仍用旧课本外，政治，国文，历史三科已采用新编课本（华北人民政府教育部编），并进行了修改与补充；在小学方面，从去年下学期开始全部采用了前华北人民政府教育部所编的新课本，编纂了各级算术补充教材、历史教学讲授提纲、国文注解等；（５）为了克服过去脱离现实的教学法，创造新的教学经验，在去年，五十八个小学开始实行了国语观摩教学，示教者有八十五人，参观者有二千七百一十九人，经过相互批评，一般纠正了教师们的只重技术不重观点，只凭主观，不看对象，单纯注入不会启发的旧式教学方法；（６）扶植与整顿了私立中学，对办理较好经费困难者并给了经费上的补助；对反动的私立中学，如志成、中大附中、大中、惠童、大众、四存等校，则分别予以代管、合并或停办。为了整顿私立中学，教育局特制定了“私立中，小学临时管理办法”及“私立中，小学董事会暂行组织纲要”。这样使得私立中学逐渐走向正轨。
    第二，广泛展开了政治思想教育。当我们接管教育机构的时候，有不少的教师和学生，因为一向受了国民党反动派的蒙蔽和歪曲宣传，对共产党和人民政府抱着怀疑的心理，对中苏关系和土地改革存在着一些误解。针对师生这种思想情况，教育当局进行了广泛思想政治教育，主要目的是肃清师生中的错误思想，建立革命的人生观。
    对学生的政治教育，以政治课为主，配合着暑期青年学园，参加劳动，参观苏联建设图片展览和其他展览等等课外活动，使学生在思想上有很大的转变：（１）一般接受了“劳动创造世界”，认识了阶级斗争；（２）对中国革命基本问题土地改革已有了基本的认识；（３）从怀疑共产党到相信共产党，一般认清了三敌四友；（４）在国际阵线上多数能分清敌我，认识苏联是我们的朋友。
    对教员的思想改造，则以自学为主，结合报告讨论，联系实际，初步运用了批评与自我批评。暑期前，在教育局和教联的领导下，组织了十六次时事政策的大报告，并在各校普遍组织学习小组，学习讨论中国革命基本问题和时事政策。暑期中，又组织了五千八百人的学习会，以历史唯物主义为学习内容，着重解决劳动观点和阶级观点，使之初步建立革命的人生观。暑期学习结束后，又组织了教员的各科业务学习会，以业务学习为主，结合政治思想教育，以达到进一步提高教师政治水平的目的。
    第三，广大的劳动群众得到了受教育的机会，一年以来，在城郊大量地开设了成人补习学校与儿童识字班，整顿了和增加了许多民教馆、图书馆与阅览室，吸收了许多工农子弟入学。工人夜校到去年八月间有一七四个班参加人数一○三九二人（九月起改由工会领导），成人夜校到去年十二月底共有四百二十三班，学生人数为一万五千人。郊区为了配合土改普遍组织了冬学，参加学习的农民有一万六千人。城郊先后整顿与发展了九个民教馆，七个书报阅览室，两个图书馆，经常举行座谈会，大众讲座，展览会和晚会，并帮助群众组织歌咏队，秧歌队和剧团。据十二月统计，城区八个馆全年阅览人数计六十万，参加晚会的计十一万。全市共有儿童识字班六百五十八班，学生二万零二十六人，并有一万五千个失学的工人子弟插入正规学校。
    这就是北京解放后一周年教育的情况，这些情况表示着什么呢？它表示着北京市人民努力向着建设新民主主义的教育道路上前进。北京过去一年在教育方面是有一些成绩的，但是无论从质的改进与量的发展那方面来说，都很不够。在中小学方面，有的还未能加以整顿，有的虽已整顿但还未走上正轨，在改造旧的制度、教学方法与教学内容方面，还未取得很多的经验，教育与生产还结合的不够，广大的劳动人民受教育的数字还不大，因此，一九五○年北京市教育的方针应该是：继续与加强政治思想教育，进一步地改进与改造中小学教育，扩充与改进技术教育和师范教育，发展工人和干部的业余教育，加强社会教育，巩固与发展工人夜校成人夜校，有计划地有步骤地开始扫除文盲，普及科学，开办各种短期训练班，大量培养专门技术人材，提高北京广大人民，特别是劳动人民的文化、政治、科学、技术知识水准，紧紧地与生产建设相结合，使北京市向着生产城市迈进一步。希望北京教育界努力在一九五○年中再大踏步地前进一步。
