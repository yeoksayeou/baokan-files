　　“不要对越南人作战！回家！回到德国来！”
    德国部长会议发表“告在法国外籍兵团中被驱使镇压越南人民解放运动的德国人书”
    【新华社北京六日电】塔斯社柏林四日讯：德意志民主共和国部长会议，二日在副总理努舍克主持之下举行会议，通过“告在法国外籍兵团中被驱使镇压越南人民解放运动的德国人书”。
    该书首先指出，德国人民认为一切被压迫的人民，都是他们在争取国家自由与和平的斗争中的盟友。因此，德意志民主共和国政府对正在为自由与独立而勇敢地斗争的越南人民，表示衷心的同情与友好。
    该书继称，数以千计的德国青年，在长期囚禁之后，被强迫参加法国外籍兵团。已有成万的德国青年，在越南战场上阵亡，还有比这更多的德国青年，在这一罪恶的帝国主义战争中正面临死亡。
    德意志民主共和国政府号召一切被迫参加法国殖民军队的德国人，脱离在越南的犯罪的战争，投向越南人民军队，并向一切从法国殖民军投向越南人民军方面的德国士兵保证：完全宽恕他们，将按照他们的志愿与能力给他们以工作，也给他们以受职业教育的机会。
    该书号召法国殖民军中的全体德国兵士们：“不要对德国人民的朋友——越南人作战！回家！回到德国来！这里正当而合理的生活正在等着你们！”
