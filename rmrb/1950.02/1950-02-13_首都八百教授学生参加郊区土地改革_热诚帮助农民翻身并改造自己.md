Eight Hundred Professors and Students in the Capital Participate in Suburban Land Reform
Enthusiastically Helping Peasants Overturn Their Lives and Transform Themselves
[Report from this newspaper] Since mid-December of last year, eight hundred university faculty members and students in Beijing have gone to the countryside to participate in the land reform work in the suburbs of Beijing. They are transforming themselves in the process of the movement to liberate the six hundred thousand peasants in the suburbs of Beijing, consolidating the achievements of ideological reform in the last semester.

As early as last summer, when news of the impending land reform in the suburbs of Beijing appeared in the newspapers, some professors and students at the Art Academy (now the Central Academy of Fine Arts) discussed not missing this opportunity to learn. When the land reform work in the suburbs of Beijing began, initiated by Principal Xu Beihong of the school, it was approved by the Ministry of Culture of the Central People's Government and enthusiastically supported by the students. The sophomores, juniors, and seniors stopped their classes and went to the countryside in mid-December (as a result of the initial reform of the school, the upper grades had more creative classes, so stopping classes to engage in land reform had little impact on their studies.) Eleven professors, lecturers, and teaching assistants, including Dong Xiweng, Li Hua, Hua Tianyou, Ai Zhongxin, Feng Fasi, Zhou Lingzhao, and Li Keran, also excitedly participated in this historical rural revolution. The principal, academic dean, and other teachers happily took over the first-grade courses for them. More than 110 faculty and students went to the countryside, first concentrating on studying the land reform policy for a week, and discussing the three reports made to them by Chai Zemin, secretary of the Beijing Suburban Committee of the Chinese Communist Party. They also conducted a self-examination, clearly affirming that they would work hard in the land reform work and transform themselves. After going to the countryside, they participated in the work groups of the 14th and 16th districts of Beijing's suburbs to assist in the work.

The participation of the faculty and students of the Central Academy of Fine Arts in the land reform attracted the attention of teachers and students from various universities, especially those in the liberal arts and law departments. The Law Department of Peking University decided to use "participating in land reform" as a summary of the students' studies this semester. Therefore, students and some teaching assistants in the department were able to avoid the final exams and went to the countryside as early as January 15 this year to participate in the land reform work in the 13th and 17th districts. Subsequently, more than one hundred faculty and students from the Central Academy of Drama, more than 280 students from the liberal arts and law departments of Tsinghua University, seven professors including Feng Youlan, Lei Haizong, and Wu Zelin, and eleven teaching assistants, along with sixty-eight students from Yenching University, and more than thirty staff members from the Central Academy of Fine Arts, and five professors including Ye Qianyu, rushed to the countryside after the major exams in various schools were over at the end of January and the beginning of February, and participated in the land reform work in the 15th, 16th, 17th, and 19th districts respectively. Before going to the countryside, most faculty and students from various schools made preparations similar to those of the Art Academy, such as studying policies and understanding the situation. Thus, since mid-December, about 800 faculty and students from various universities in Beijing have successively participated in land reform (almost twice as many as the original 400 land reform cadres in the suburbs of Beijing), distributed in the sixty-five work groups in the six of the eight districts carrying out land reform in the suburbs of Beijing, working in more than one hundred administrative villages.

With the active enthusiasm of the faculty and students of various schools, and with the patient help of the original cadres of the CCP Suburban Committee, District Committee, and various work groups, they have done a lot of work to help the six hundred thousand peasants in the suburbs of Beijing to liberate themselves. They filled out land use certificates for peasants, measured land, calculated the accounts of land allocation and redistribution of farm implements and livestock, taught classes in winter schools and literacy classes, did youth, women's, and youth league building work, etc.; in the work groups, they sorted out reporting materials, copied work summaries, served as food committee members, and helped worker-peasant cadres read newspapers. After a period of learning through work and policy study, they could independently manage a group or area group, a village or two villages, just like the original cadres in the work group, and systematically carry out the work of each stage of land reform under the unified leadership of the suburban committee, district committee, and work group.

Through Actual Struggle and Exercise, Class Standpoint Tends to Be Clear

Through various practical tasks, such as peasants' complaints, fighting against local bullies, class division, and building the Party and the League, faculty and students from various schools personally saw the cruelty of feudal exploitation and the depth of the peasants' suffering, and personally saw the strength of the peasants after liberation. Their positions, viewpoints, and methods have undergone significant changes. Generally, Party and League members have further clarified their class standpoints, further criticized the remaining non-proletarian consciousness, and gained a deeper understanding of the working methods of the mass line. For example, Li Tianxiang, a member of the Chinese Communist Party from the Central Academy of Fine Arts, criticized his "family warmth" and other concepts in his thinking that lacked a class standpoint, and reviewed his past work style of paternalism and formalism in the school. After learning about class division, League member Cao Zuorui knew that his family was a landlord (originally, his family was classified as a rich peasant in the village), and wrote a letter asking his family to honestly bow to the people, obey government decrees, and work hard. Other students and professors dispelled their doubts about land reform, recognized the existence of classes, and initially clarified their class standpoints. For example, a student from Peking University working in Dahwangzhuang said, "Today we realized that people have class nature, and everyone has a component." A student from Huayuanzha said, "In this sharp class struggle, we know that there is only one-sidedness, and there is no third way." Secondly, they also personally experienced the greatness of the power of the masses, and knew that they must rely on the masses and activists, thus initially establishing the mass viewpoint. For example, a student from Peking University in Heiqiao said, "At first, the bad guys were in control here, and the masses were not mobilized, so the work was difficult to carry out; later, the masses rose up, the conspiracies of the bad elements were exposed, and the work went smoothly." Some students changed their previous wrong ideas in the land reform movement and eagerly demanded progress. A large number of students saw the correctness of the CCP's land reform policy in the land reform, further approached the Party, and actively strived to join the Party and the League. In addition, faculty and students from various schools have specifically experienced the life of peasants and learned a lot of production knowledge. However, there are also individual students who returned to school without authorization because they could not endure hardship in the land reform, or who held a bystander attitude in the land reform, thinking that they were here to "learn" and "see," so they did not actively and proactively work, or were arrogant and looked down on worker-peasant cadres. These examples aroused the vigilance of the vast majority of professors and students, and inspired everyone to overcome the weaknesses of intellectuals and seriously transform themselves.

In terms of life, since faculty and students from various schools were fully prepared before going to the countryside, and with the appropriate care of the Party and the government, they generally lived happily in the rural environment. The degree of their closeness to the peasants deepened as they participated in the land reform work. For example, Zhou Lingzhao, a lecturer at the Central Academy of Fine Arts, has become very good friends with Zhou Yuanzhen, a farmhand, Yin Yuliang, a poor peasant, and Cui Xingzhou, a farmhand, in Wangjia Village, and they have agreed to communicate with each other in the future. Yin Yuliang, who has never seen the Forbidden City and has not entered the city for more than ten years, will come to the city to see Zhou Lingzhao during the Spring Festival, and they have agreed to visit the Forbidden City and other scenic spots together.

　　首都八百教授学生参加郊区土地改革
    热诚帮助农民翻身并改造自己
    【本报讯】北京八百大学师生，自去年十二月中旬起陆续下乡参加京郊土地改革工作，并在京郊六十万农民的翻身运动中改造着自己，巩固了上学期思想改造的成果。
    早在去年暑假，当京郊将要实行土地改革的消息在报上出现的时候，艺专（现为中央美术学院）的一部分教授学生便讨论了不要放过这个学习的机会。及至京郊土地改革工作展开，由该校徐悲鸿校长发起，得到中央人民政府文化部的批准和学生们热烈的拥护，二、三、四年级学生在十二月中旬便停课下乡（该校初步改革的结果，高年班创作课较多，停课搞土改，对于功课影响不大。）董希文、李桦、滑田友、艾中信、冯祛祀、周令钊、李可染等十一位教授、讲助教等也极其兴奋地参加了这一历史性的农村革命运动，校长、教务长和其他先生则高兴地代他们担任一年级的功课。下乡的师生一百一十余人，下乡前集中学习了一星期的土地改革政策，并讨论了中共北京市郊委书记柴泽民向他们作的三次报告。他们又作了一次思想检查，明确肯定了要在土地改革工作中好好工作，改造自己。下乡后分别参加了京郊十四、十六两区的工作组协助进行工作。
    中央美术学院师生的参加土改，引起了各大学尤其是文法学院师生的注视。北京大学法律系决定以“参加土改”作为该系学生本学期学习的总结，因而该系学生与一部分助教得以不参加期终考试，提早于今年一月十五日即下乡参加了十三、十七两区的土改工作。接着，中央戏剧学院师生一百余人，清华大学文法学院学生二百八十余人，教授冯友兰、雷海宗、吴泽霖等七人及助教十一人，与燕京大学学生六十八人，中央美术学院美干班三十余人，教授叶浅予等五人在各校大考刚一结束以后，于一月底至二月初，急急忙忙赶着下乡，分别参加了十五、十六、十七、十九四个区的土改工作。各校师生在下乡前，大多做了与艺专相仿的准备工作如学习政策、了解情况等。这样，北京各大学师生自十二月中旬起到现在为止，陆续参加土改的共约八百人（比之于京郊原有土改工作干部四百余人几乎多了两倍），分布在京郊进行着土改的八个区的六个区的六十五个工作组中，在一百多个行政村中进行工作。
    各校师生积极热情，在中共郊委、区委以及各工作组原有干部的耐心帮助下，为京郊六十万农民翻身做了很多工作。他们为农民填写土地使用证，丈量土地，计算抽补土地及分配农具、牲口等各项帐目，在冬学、识字班教课、做青年、妇女以及建团工作等；在工作组中则整理汇报材料，抄写工作总结，担任伙食委员，帮助工农干部读报。经过一个阶段的工作中的学习以及政策学习，他们即与工作组中原有干部一样单独掌握一个小组或片儿组，一个村或两个村，在郊委、区委、工作组的统一领导下，系统地进行土改各个阶段的工作。
    经过实际斗争锻炼  阶级立场趋于明确
    通过各项实际工作，如农民诉苦，斗争恶霸，划阶级，建党建团等，各校师生亲身看到封建剥削的残酷以及农民痛苦的深重，亲身看到农民翻身后的力量，他们的立场、观点、方法都有了显著的改变。一般党团员更加明确了阶级立场，进一步批判了残余的非无产阶级意识，并对于群众路线的工作方法有了进一步的体会。如中央美术学院的中共党员李天祥批判了他思想中缺乏阶级立场的“家庭温暖”等观念，并检讨了过去在学校里的包办代替、形式主义的工作作风。团员曹作睿学了划阶级以后，知道自己家庭是地主（本来村中划他家为富农），写信叫家中要老老实实地向人民低头，服从政府法令，努力从事劳动。其他同学及教授则解除了对于土改的怀疑，认识了阶级的存在，初步明确了阶级立场。如北大在大黄庄工作的同学说：“今天我们体会了人是有阶级性的，每一个人都有成份。”花园闸同学说：“在这种尖锐的阶级斗争中，我们知道只有一边倒，没有第三条路了。”其次，他们也切身体验到群众力量的伟大，知道要依靠群众和积极分子，因而初步建立了群众观点。如北大在黑桥的同学说：“起初在这儿是坏人操纵，群众没有发动起来，工作就难开展；后来群众起来了，坏分子阴谋被揭破，工作进行就顺利了。”一些同学在土改运动中改变了自己以前错误的想法，迫切要求进步。大批同学在土改中看到中共土改政策的正确，更进一步地靠近了党，积极争取入党入团。此外，各校师生都具体体会了农民的生活，并学习了不少生产知识。但也有个别同学在土改中因为吃不了苦而径自回校，或在土改中抱旁观态度，以为自己是来“学习”，是来“看看”的，因而不积极主动的工作，或自高自大，轻视工农干部。这些例子，引起了绝大多数教授、同学的警惕，激励了大家克服知识分子弱点，严肃地改造自己的决心。
    在生活方面，由于各校师生在下乡前都有充分思想准备，加以党与政府的适当照顾，因此一般在农村环境中生活得很愉快。他们与农民的接近程度，则随他们参加土改工作的进度而加深。如中央美术学院的讲师周令钊已和王家村的雇农周元振、贫农尹玉良、雇农崔兴州等结了很好的朋友，并已约定以后互通往来。从未看过故宫，十多年未进过城的尹玉良将于春节进城来看周令钊，并约定一同去游历故宫等名胜。
