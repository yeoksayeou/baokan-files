[Beijing News] Since the Beijing Water Company reduced water prices last December, the price per metric ton of water is: 1.5 *jin* of millet for industrial and commercial users; 1 *jin* of millet for general households, government organizations, military units, and schools; and 0.75 *jin* of millet for bathhouses and retail water stations. Each charge is converted based on the millet price at the end of the previous month. According to this method, the price of millet last December should have been converted to 900 yuan per *jin*, but to alleviate the burden on citizens, the company temporarily converted it at 800 yuan. No adjustments were made in January of this year either. The company has now received approval from the Municipal Bureau of Industry to continue charging water prices according to the above method for February, with each *jin* of millet calculated at a conversion rate of 1,000 yuan.

　　自来水公司水价折米减收
    【北京讯】京市自来水公司自去年十二月起减低水价后，每用水一公吨：工商户为一斤半小米，一般住户及机关、部队、学校为一斤小米，澡堂及零售水站，为零点七五斤小米。每次收费均以上月底米价折收。按此项办法，去年十二月份每斤米价本应折合九百元，但该公司为减轻市民负担，暂按八百元折收；今年一月份也未加调整。该公司现已呈准市工业局，二月份水价仍按上项办法收费，每市斤米以一千元折价计算。
