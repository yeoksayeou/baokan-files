Xinhua News Agency, Qingdao, 20th. The Second Qingdao Municipal All-Circles People's Representatives Conference was held from the 8th to the 11th, attended by 402 representatives from all circles. The conference heard a report by Xiang Ming, Director of the Qingdao Military Control Commission, on the tasks of the people of Qingdao in 1950; a report by Mayor Ma Bao San on the work of the municipal government; and a report by Xue Shangshi, Chairman of the Standing Committee of the All-Circles People's Representatives Conference, on assisting the government in implementing the resolutions of the previous conference and preparing for the convening of this conference. Director Xiang Ming emphasized in his report that the three major problems that the people of Qingdao urgently need to solve are to practice strict economy in production, complete the issuance of the People's Victory Indexed Bonds to overcome the state's financial difficulties; to further connect material exchanges between urban and rural areas, and internally and externally; and to launch a self-salvation through production movement to gradually solve the employment of unemployed laborers. In his report on the work of the municipal government, Mayor Ma Baosan, pointed out the achievements of the municipal people's government in implementing the resolutions of the previous conference, saying that regarding the restoration and development of production, state-owned enterprises, on the basis of strengthening the political awareness of workers and initially implementing democratic management, have achieved the results of reducing costs, increasing production, and improving quality. For example, the No. 1 factory of China Textile Corporation has achieved a maximum hourly production of 0.65 pounds per spindle for 32-count yarn, breaking the previous highest standard of 0.64 pounds during enemy and puppet management. Private industrial and commercial enterprises have also gradually increased, and the number of factories and workshops in the city that have started work has increased from 2,060 to 2,560. The output of various machine parts and iron pots has increased by more than 100% compared with September of last year. In terms of commerce, there are 563 news agencies, and 26 have resumed business, which is double the number before liberation. In terms of the city government's financial expenditure, administrative expenses have gradually been reduced to 35.52%, while various public service expenditures have been expanded to 64.48%. Other work, such as inventorying and receiving materials, rectifying social order, cultural education, municipal engineering construction, public health, and social relief, has also achieved significant gains. Mayor Ma also proposed that it is still necessary to strengthen support for the War of Liberation, support the army and give preferential treatment to families of revolutionary soldiers, consolidate revolutionary order, launch social mutual assistance, and restore and develop production to ensure the national financial revenue and expenditure budget. The conference conducted a heated discussion on the three reports and expressed unanimous support. The conference received a total of 180 proposals. After additions and revisions, it adopted three resolutions: "Strengthen and develop mutual assistance between urban and rural areas, internal and external exchanges, and restore industry and commerce in a planned manner to solve the sales of industrial products and agricultural by-products, the outlet for idle capital, and the problem of industrial raw materials to restore and develop production"; "Organize the masses to widely carry out social relief with self-salvation through production as the main focus"; "Call on people from all walks of life to actively complete the task of promoting and purchasing People's Victory Indexed Bonds." Finally, in accordance with the "Organizational Regulations for Municipal All-Circles People's Representatives Conferences" promulgated by the Central People's Government, the conference elected 35 members to form the Qingdao Municipal Consultative Committee, with Xue Shangshi, Fan Chengchuan, and Zhang Gongzhi serving as chairman and vice-chairmen, respectively.
