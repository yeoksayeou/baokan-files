　　Suburban Committee Deploys Current Work
    Combines Land Reform to Complete Spring Plowing Preparations
    [Beijing News] The Suburban Work Committee of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China held a joint meeting of the CPC District Committee Secretaries and District Heads of the suburban districts on the 9th and 10th to discuss the 1950 agricultural production plan, production and disaster relief, land reform, and other issues. Chai Zemin, Secretary of the Suburban Work Committee of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, pointed out in his report on the agricultural production plan: Now that spring has begun, we must complete the preparations for spring production while completing the central task of land reform in the suburbs. Based on the calculation of 1,044,978 mu of land area in the entire suburbs, the annual total output is 154,943,030 jin. According to the call for increased production by the Central People's Government and the specific conditions in the suburbs, we plan to increase production by 15%. This task is arduous. Due to long-term war and famine, there are many difficulties, but we have the conditions to complete it. First, we have carried out land reform, and we must also strive to improve water conservancy, improve varieties, apply more fertilizer, improve farm tools, and cultivate deeply and meticulously to ensure the completion of this plan. At the same time, in order to shorten the spring famine, farmers should be called upon to plant more early-maturing crops such as spring wheat, barley, foreign corn, garden beans, and garlic. Cooperatives should also actively find ways to help solve the seed shortage.
    When discussing the issue of production and disaster relief, Chai Zemin pointed out in his speech: Although we vigorously led the masses in production for self-salvation last winter and solved many problems, the spring famine is still long. The relevant district committees must further understand the disaster situation and help the disaster-stricken people obtain ways to self-salvation. In particular, the 13th and 14th districts should be jointly organized by the CPC District Committee, the District Government, the Public Security Bureau, the Cooperative, and the People's Bank to form a production and disaster relief team to go deep into the disaster areas and guide the work of production and disaster relief.
    According to the reports on the progress of land reform in various districts, the second batch of land reform in the suburbs will be largely completed before the Spring Festival, and the third batch of villages will be carried out after the Spring Festival. The land reform in Shijingshan, Changxindian, Mentougou and other districts has been basically completed. It is expected that the land reform in the suburbs will be fully completed before the end of March. Finally, Chai Zemin made a summary, pointing out that the current focus is still on land reform, and there can be no slackening until the land reform of the last village is completed. However, we must not relax the preparations for large-scale production. Once the land reform is completed, we can fully switch to large-scale production. (Leng Lin)

　　郊委布置当前工作
    结合土地改革完成春耕准备
    【北京讯】中共北京市委会郊区工作委员会于九、十两日召开各郊区中共区委书记及区长联席会议，讨论一九五○年农业生产计划、生产救灾、土地改革等问题。中共北京市郊委书记柴泽民报告农业生产计划时指出：现在已经立春，我们要在完成郊区土地改革的中心任务下，完成春季大生产的准备工作。根据全郊区土地面积一百零四万四千九百七十八亩计算，常年总产量为一万万五千四百九十四万三千零三十斤。我们根据中央人民政府的增产号召和郊区具体情况，计划增产一成半。这个任务是艰巨的，由于长期战争与灾荒，困难是很多的，但我们有条件完成；首先我们是进行了土地改革，而且我们还要从兴修水利，改良品种，多施肥料，改进农具，深耕细作等方面努力，以保证这一计划的完成。同时为了缩短春荒，应号召农民多种春麦、大麦、洋玉米、菀豆、大蒜等早熟作物，合作社也要积极设法帮助解决种籽困难。
    在讨论生产救灾问题时，柴泽民发言指出：去冬我们虽已大力领导群众生产自救，解决了很多问题，但春荒尚长，各有关区委必须进一步深入了解灾情，帮助灾民获得自救之道。特别是十三、十四区应由中共区委会、区政府、公安局、合作社、人民银行联合组织生产救灾小组，深入灾区，指导生产救灾工作。
    根据各区土地改革进行情况的汇报，郊区第二批土地改革将于春节前大部完成，春节后进行第三批村庄。石景山、长辛店、门头沟等区土地改革已基本上结束，预计三月底以前郊区土地改革即可全部完成。最后，由柴泽民作总结，他指出目前仍以土地改革为主，不能松劲，一直到最后一个村子的土地改革完成为止。但也不能放松大生产的准备工作，一俟土地改革结束，即可全力转入大生产。（冷林）
