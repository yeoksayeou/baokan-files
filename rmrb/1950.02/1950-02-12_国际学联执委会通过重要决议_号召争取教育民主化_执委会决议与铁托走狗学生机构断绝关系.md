Xinhua News Agency, London, February 10th: The Executive Committee meeting of the International Student Union, held in London from the 2nd to the 8th, discussed the issue of student organizations struggling for the democratic reform of public education.

The General Secretary of the ISU, Beringer, made a report on this issue. He pointed out that, on the one hand, military spending has greatly increased, while on the other hand, education funding has been cut. The economic situation of students in capitalist and colonial countries is deteriorating. He said that senior high schools in the United States are becoming increasingly militarized. Progressive professors and teachers are being excluded from universities. Discrimination and coercion against democratic students have been intensified. The United States has become the main supplier of reactionary culture and intends to use reactionary culture to poison the youth of Western European countries so that they can serve as cannon fodder in future wars. At the same time, Beringer cited many significant facts in his report to prove the great achievements of higher education in the Soviet Union and the People's Democratic countries.

In the resolution passed after the debate on the report, the Executive Committee of the International Student Union called on democratic students, scientific and cultural workers to resolutely fight for the democratization of education and to link this struggle with the defense of peace!

The Executive Committee decided to convene the Second Congress of the International Student Union in Prague on August 14th this year.

The Executive Committee also decided to sever relations with the leaders of the student organizations affiliated with the Yugoslav "People's Youth," who are lackeys of the Tito-Ranković fascist clique, which has thrown thousands of student democrats into concentration camps.

　　国际学联执委会通过重要决议
    号召争取教育民主化 
    执委会决议与铁托走狗学生机构断绝关系
    【新华社北京十一日电】塔斯社伦敦十日讯：二日至八日在伦敦举行的国际学生联合会执委会会议，曾讨论学生组织为争取民众教育的民主改革而斗争的问题。
    学联总书记贝林格曾就这一问题作了报告。他指出：一方面是军费的大大增加，而另一方面是教育经费的削减。资本主义国家和殖民地国家中学生的经济情况，每况愈下。他说：美国的高级中学，越来越军事化了。进步的教授和教师，都被摈于大学的门外。对民主学生的歧视与强制手段，已形加紧。美国已经成为反动文化的主要供应者，并欲借助反动文化来毒害西欧各国的青年，使他们在将来的战争中充当炮灰。同时，贝林格又在报告中援引了许多显著的事实，证明苏联及人民民主国家高等教育的重大成就。
    在对报告举行辩论后所通过的决议中，国际学联执委会号召民主学生、科学与文化工作者，为争取教育民主化而坚决斗争，把这一斗争与保卫和平连结起来！
    执委会决定今年八月十四日在布拉格召开国际学联第二届代表大会。
    执委会又决定与南斯拉夫《人民青年》所属的学生机构的各领导者断绝关系，他们是铁托——兰科维奇法西斯集团的走狗，而铁托——兰科维奇法西斯集团则把数以千计的学生——民主分子投入集中营。
