Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, February 1st: TASS, Moscow - Soviet newspapers on January 31 published reports of the first meeting of the Central Election Commission for the election of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR. The meeting discussed election preparations and adopted several resolutions based on the "Election Law of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR." The newspapers also published the sample ballot paper determined by the Central Election Commission for the election of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR.

Communications from various places have reported on the mass election campaigns being carried out in various places, the collection of voter lists, and the competition being conducted for the elections.

Pravda, in an editorial, strongly urged the expansion of the scale of election propaganda work in rural areas.

Izvestia published an editorial entitled "The Strength of Democracy and Socialism is Growing and Becoming Stronger," stating that the competition between the two systems is increasingly clearly showing the bankruptcy of capitalism, which is historically doomed to perish, and fully revealing the superiority of socialism. The camp of socialism has expanded, while the camp of capitalism has shrunk. This is the outline of post-war historical development. The growth of the forces of democracy and socialism is primarily manifested in the continued advance with overwhelming momentum of the world's first worker-peasant socialist country, which leads the people of all countries in the struggle for peace. Izvestia concluded by pointing out that the Soviet Union, which is completing the gradual transition to communism, is a lighthouse pointing out a bright future for all progressive mankind. The achievements of the Soviet people in building a communist society inspire the working people of the world to selflessly struggle against imperialism and for peace, democracy and socialism.

    讨论选举筹备问题
    群众性选举运动已展开
    【新华社北京一日电】塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏联各报于一月三十一日刊载苏联最高苏维埃选举中央选举委员会第一次会议的报道，在这会议上讨论了选举筹备问题，并通过以《苏联最高苏维埃选举法》为基础的若干决定。各报并登载苏联最高苏维埃选举中央选举委员会所确定的选票票样。
    各地通讯纷纷报道各处所进行的群众性的选举运动，选民名单的收集，以及为选举而进行的竞赛情形。
    真理报在社论中力促扩大农村中选举宣传工作的规模。
    消息报以“民主与社会主义的力量正在增长壮大”为题，发表社论称：两个制度的竞赛，越来越明白地显示了为历史注定要灭亡的资本主义的破产，并充分显露出社会主义的优越性。社会主义的阵营扩大了，资本主义的阵营却是缩小了。这便是战后历史发展的概要。民主与社会主义力量的增长，首先表现在领导各国人民为和平而斗争的世界上第一个工农社会主义国家以排山倒海之势的继续前进上。消息报结语指出，正在完成逐步过渡到共产主义的苏联，是给全体进步人类指出光明前途的灯塔。苏联人民在建设共产主义社会中所获得的成就，鼓舞着全世界的勤劳人民为反对帝国主义、争取和平、民主与社会主义而忘我地斗争。
