　　Northwest Military Region Instructs All Units:
　　Rationally Reorganize Institutions at All Levels  Launch a Production Movement Throughout the Army
    Strengthen Learning to Improve Troop Quality
    [Xinhua News Agency, Lanzhou, 24th] In view of the fact that the Northwest has been completely liberated and has entered a new period of peaceful construction, the Northwest Military Region of the People's Liberation Army issued instructions on February 13 concerning streamlining the army, improving the quality of the troops, and troop production. The instructions pointed out: It is necessary to rationally reorganize institutions, abolish redundant organs, and reduce surplus personnel in order to reduce the state's financial expenditures and strengthen the production force. Existing field armies, military regions, military sub-districts, and military, political, and logistics organs at all levels must be strictly streamlined. Field armies should be merged with military regions and military sub-districts. All organs should, as far as possible, implement collective office work and collective board and lodging to reduce logistical, communications, guard, cooking, and animal husbandry personnel. The establishment of troop drama troupes: Propaganda teams of divisions shall not exceed sixty people; corps and armies shall not exceed one hundred people; field armies concurrently serving as military regions shall not establish separate drama troupes. Old art troupes originally belonging to various units should be helped to transform into enterprises. Horses and mules should be reduced according to specific circumstances, and livestock should generally be used to organize transportation cooperatives. Those unsuitable for military use should be given to poor families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers. In order to carry out this task, the entire army must complete a general inventory before May of this year. The instructions further pointed out: Field armies and local troops should immediately stop expanding. Vigorously improving the quality of troops and raising the level of cadres is the central task for building a regularized national defense force in the future. To this end, cadres who have been in combat environments for a long time and those from poor backgrounds who have lost learning opportunities should first improve their cultural level and scientific knowledge. This year, each army must establish a crash middle school with around five hundred students and run teaching regiments (teams) and rotating training classes well. On-the-job cadres should be organized into classes according to their cultural level (regardless of position) and implement a two-hour daily study system. Those with higher education levels should study basic theory in addition to policy studies; those with lower levels should mainly engage in cultural studies in addition to policy studies. Before the spring plowing this year, all troops must formulate detailed plans for cadre education and report them to the military region before April. Regarding production and construction, the instructions pointed out that the entire army must complete three months of self-sufficiency in food, oil, salt, vegetables, and other necessities this year. Military families should also participate in appropriate production work and study according to specific circumstances. It is advocated to rely on the participation of all soldiers in labor, establish public and private household affairs, and create social and national wealth. However, it should be noted that the participation of troops in production is not to compete with the people for profits, but to demonstrate the superiority of collective labor and the collective economy to the people. All units should democratically formulate specific plans suitable to local conditions, and be sure to launch an army-wide production competition after the beginning of spring, so that no one stands outside the production front and no one eats idle food. The instructions pointed out that the Xinjiang troops have made full ideological and technical preparations for this year's production movement, therefore calling on the entire army to learn from them.

　　西北军区训令各部
　　合理整编各级机构  开展全军生产运动
    加强学习提高部队质量
    【新华社兰州二十四日电】人民解放军西北军区，鉴于西北已全部解放，步入和平建设的新时期，特于二月十三日发布有关精简部队、提高部队质量和部队生产等问题的训令。训令中指出：要合理整编机构，裁撤重叠机关，核减冗员，以减轻国家财政开支，加强生产阵容。现有野战军、军区、军分区和各级军、政后勤机关，必须严格精简。野战军与军区、军分区合并。各机关尽可能做到集体办公和集体食宿，减少勤务、通讯、警卫、炊事、饲养等杂务人员。部队剧团编制：师宣传队不得超过六十人；兵团和军不得超过百人；野战军兼军区者不另设剧团。各部原有之旧艺剧团，应帮助其转为企业化。马匹、驮骡应按具体情况予以裁减，牲口一般用以组织运输合作社。不适军用者，赠给贫苦的烈士军人家属。为执行此任务，全军须于本年五月前完成一次总点验。训令继指出：野战军和地方部队应立即停止扩大。大力提高部队质量，提高干部水平，为今后建设正规化国防军的中心任务。为此，对长久处在战斗环境中和出身贫苦而失掉学习机会的干部，首先应提高其文化水平和科学常识。今年各军必须创办一个五百人上下的速成中学，并办好教导团（队）和轮训班。在职干部应按文化水平（不按职位）编成班次，实行每日两小时学习制。文化程度高者，除政策学习外，并进行基本理论学习；低者除政策学习外，主要进行文化学习。今年春耕前，各部队对干部教育必须订出详细计划，限四月前报告军区。关于生产建设方面，训令指出，今年全军必须完成三个月的粮食、油、盐、菜蔬等自给任务。军队家属亦应按具体情况参加适当的生产工作和学习。提倡依靠全体军人参加劳动，建立公私家务，创造社会和国家的财富。但要注意部队参加生产并非与民争利，而是以集体劳动、集体经济的优越性示范于人民。各部应民主订出适合各地情况的具体计划，务必在开春后开展全军生产竞赛，做到没有一个人站在生产战线之外，没有一个人吃闲饭。训令指出，新疆部队对今年生产运动已做了思想上技术上的充分准备工作，因此号召全军向他们学习。
