　　The state-owned Datong Coal Mine in North China has seen a significant increase in production efficiency since the launch of the democratic movement in early December of last year. This is due to the leadership's correct use of criticism and self-criticism, starting with an examination of the leadership itself, which has yielded great results. In twenty days, employees of the five mines submitted a total of 500 suggestions for improving the mine, including 306 related to production and construction, and others related to improving employee welfare, improving leadership, and social security. As a result of the enthusiasm of the workers, improvements in labor organization, and a significant increase in production efficiency, waste has also been reduced. The coal carts in Dongda Alley, which previously required 44 people to push, can now save 17 people after improving labor organization. In No. 1 and No. 3 mines, the average daily output per worker was 0.26 tons in the past, and now the average output per person is 0.2902 tons. At the Tongjialiang Mine, workers voluntarily discussed coal mining specifications, which saved manpower and increased coal production. At the same time, in the democratic movement, the political consciousness of the workers has gradually increased, strengthening their love and protection of the mine. Workers at the Baitong Mine monitored and prohibited the destructive behavior of stealing accumulated coal from old ponds, and workers at the Tongjialiang Mine reported the destructive behavior of Qiao Li, a saboteur among the workers, who was stealing coal pillars. Due to the correct use of criticism and self-criticism, the staff generally conducted in-depth self-examinations, resolving certain past differences between new and old cadres and employees. For example, Zhang Qigui, a staff member at the Baitong Mine, had a bad attitude towards workers in the past. After reflection, he voluntarily apologized to the workers and was understood by the workers. Staff and engineers overcame past bureaucratic habits, personally went down the mine to study projects, and consulted with workers on matters. Workers also voluntarily sought out cadres to exchange opinions, which greatly helped the leadership. As a result, the prestige of the trade union has greatly increased, and workers have been clamoring to join the trade union. The number of union members has increased from 1,241 to 1,733.
    In leading the democratic movement, the reasonable suggestions of workers must be earnestly implemented in order to mobilize their enthusiasm and creativity. After the Tongjialiang Mine first solved the workers' request to repair the well roadway, the workers' morale immediately changed, and they then put forward 103 suggestions for improving the work. On the contrary, if the Yongdingzhuang Coal Mine failed to solve the problems raised by the workers in a timely manner, although the workers' morale was high at the beginning of the movement, it quickly cooled down. At the same time, the leadership's in-depth criticism and self-criticism played a significant role in dispelling employees' ideological concerns and promoting worker unity. The leadership of individual units emphasized that they were busy with work and failed to conduct in-depth self-examination, resulting in the failure of the movement to develop. The organizational work of the Party, the Youth League, and the Trade Union must be able to adapt to the development of the movement at any time. The Tongjialiang Mine accepted the workers' opinions, rectified the trade union in the movement, and used trade union groups to cultivate backbones, so that the movement could be further promoted. Some mines did not pay attention to the combination of trade union work and Party and Youth League work, so the enthusiasm of the masses in the entire movement was not great enough, and the results were relatively small.

### 华北国营大同煤矿开展民主运动生产效率提高

　　华北国营大同煤矿开展民主运动生产效率提高
    【本报讯】华北国营大同煤矿，自去年十二月初开展民主运动以来，由于领导上正确的掌握了批评与自我批评的武器，先从检查领导入手，获得很大成就。二十天中，五个矿的职工共提出对矿山的改进意见达五百件，其中有关生产建设的三百零六件，其它为改善职工福利、改进领导及社会治安等项。由于工人积极性得到发扬，改进了劳动组织，生产效率显著提高，浪费现象亦已减少。东大巷过去需四十四人推的煤车，改进劳动组织后，可以节省十七个人力。一号井和三号井，过去每个工平均日产量为○．二六吨，现在平均每人产量为○．二九○二吨。同家梁矿，工人自动讨论出刨煤规格，既节省人力又多出了煤。同时在民主运动中，工人政治觉悟日渐提高，加强他们对矿山的爱护。白洞矿工人监视并禁止了偷挖古塘积煤的破坏行为，同家梁矿工检举出工人中的破坏分子乔理偷挖煤柱的破坏行为。由于正确的运用了批评和自我批评的武器，职工间普遍进行了深刻检讨，解决了过去新老干部及职工间的某些隔阂。如白洞矿职员张启贵过去对工人态度不好，经反省后自动向工人道歉，得到工人谅解。职员与工程师克服了过去的官僚主义习气，亲自下井研究工程，有事并与工人商量，工人也自动找干部交换意见，对领导帮助很大。因之工会威信大增，工人纷纷要求加入工会。工会会员已由一千二百四十一名，增加到一千七百三十三名。
    在领导开展民主运动中，对工人的合理建议，必须认真付诸实现，方能发动他们的积极性和创造性。同家梁矿第一次解决了工人所提出修井道的要求之后，工人情绪就马上转变了，紧接着又提出一百零三件改进工作的意见。相反的，如永定庄煤矿对工人提出意见未能及时加以解决，运动开始时工人情绪虽高，但很快就冷淡下来了。同时，领导上进行深刻的批评与自我批评，对解除职工思想顾虑，促进工人团结作用很大。个别单位的领导方面，强调工作忙，未能深刻检查自己，结果使运动不能开展。党、团、工会的组织工作，必须能随时适应运动的发展。同家梁矿接受工人意见，在运动中整顿了工会，运用工会小组培养骨干，使运动得以向前推进一步。有的矿上没有注意工会工作和党团工作结合进行，因此在整个运动中群众的劲头不够大，收到的效果也就比较小。
