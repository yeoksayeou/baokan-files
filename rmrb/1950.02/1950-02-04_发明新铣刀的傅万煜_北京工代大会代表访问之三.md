　　Fu Wanyu, a lathe operator at the 70th Ordnance Factory's 6th Workshop, is 26 years old. He invented the three-jaw chuck milling cutter, which increased the production of three-jaw chucks ninefold. He became an apprentice at the Xinjiangkou 39 Industrial Cooperative at the age of thirteen, where he learned lathe work, fitting, and forging. He has been working at the current 70th Ordnance Factory since 1941.

　　During the Kuomintang era, he was the best at loafing around. He said that the more he worked, the worse he felt. Highly-placed staff with connections could earn ten workers' salaries, and he felt resentful about it. By the end of the month, before he even received his pay, prices had already increased several times over. He wanted to quit, but he was afraid of being conscripted into the army. He had a bellyful of anger with no outlet, so he would often rush through a day's work in a few hours and then go to the kitchen to read novels. That's how Fu Wanyu muddled through those seven or eight years.

　　After Beijing was liberated, the status of workers improved, and they were respected everywhere. Wages were also adjusted reasonably. Like other workers, Fu Wanyu used his intelligence and actively sought ways to improve production. During the "May 1st" competition last year, Fu Wanyu made a batch of parts: medicine press dies. These press dies were thick at one end and thin at the other. The old method was to rigidly use a very thick piece of material to turn, resulting in a lot of material being wasted on the thin end. He felt it was awkward, so he came up with a method: use thin material to turn, and after turning, separately turn the thick end and inlay it. This saved a lot of material.

　　He felt that making chucks using the old methods was too slow, so he focused on researching and improving the milling cutter. At first, some of his fellow workers said, "That's how it's always been done, how can you change it?" Fu Wanyu went home and lay on the kang, thinking: How can it not work? I must try it! He finally succeeded. He divided the circular milling cutter into fifteen equal parts on a concentric circle. The tip of each part is the cutting edge. By raising the work piece by one millimeter, he could mill out the jaws. Previously, only six could be made in a day. Now, with this newly invented tool, an average of one can be completed every eight or nine minutes, increasing production efficiency ninefold.

　　The factory and the trade union highly valued his creation. In addition to moral recognition, they also provided material rewards. He was both moved and excited, saying, "I didn't expect everyone to pay so much attention to this little thing, and there are so many rewards."

　　发明新铣刀的傅万煜
    北京工代大会代表访问之三
    周永灏
    七十兵工厂六所车工傅万煜，今年二十六岁，他发明了三爪卡盘铣扣刀，使三爪卡盘的产量提高了九倍。从十三岁他就在新街口三九工业社当了学徒，车工、钳工、锻工在那时都学会了。一九四一年起，他就在现在的七十兵工厂作工。
    国民党在的时候，他是最会泡的一个。他说那时越干越不是味儿，有门子的高级职员一个人能拿十个工人的薪水，他瞅着心里有气，月底开支的时候，钱还没有领到手，物价先涨了好几倍；想不干，又怕抓兵；他满肚子气没处发泄，往往把一天活凑合着在几个钟头里赶出来以后，便跑到厨房里去看看小说，傅万煜那时就这样混了七八年。
    北京一解放，工人地位提高了，到处受到尊重；工资也合理调整了。傅万煜和其他工人一样，运用自己的智慧，在生产上积极想改进办法。去年“五一”竞赛时，傅万煜作的一批活，是镟压药冲具，这压药冲具一头粗，一头细，以往的做法是死死板板把一块很粗的料拿来镟，结果细的那一头得镟掉很多，原料耗费很大，他看着蹩扭，便想了个法子，拿细的料来镟，镟完后，另外再镟粗的那一头镶上去，这样省了许多原料。
    他觉得用老法子做卡盘太慢他便专心研究改进铣刀。乍一开始时，有的工友还说：“早先都是那么做，怎改得了？”傅万煜回家躺在炕上想：怎会不行呢？一定要做做看！他终于试验成功了。他把圆形铣刀在同心圆上分为十五等分，每等分的尖端，就是刀刃，把活通身垫高一粍，就可以铣出爪来。从前一天只见做六个，现在用这个新发明的工具，平均每八九分钟就能完成一个，生产效率提高了九倍。
    厂方和工会非常重视他的创造，除精神表扬外，并给以物质奖励。他又感动又兴奋地说：“没想到这点事，大家这么注意，还有这许多奖励。”
