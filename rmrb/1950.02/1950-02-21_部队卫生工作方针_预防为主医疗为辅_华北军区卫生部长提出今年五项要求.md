Military Health Work Policy: Prevention First, Treatment Second
   North China Military Region Health Minister Outlines Five Requirements for the Year

[This newspaper dispatch] The Health Department of the North China Military Region convened a meeting of health administrative cadres in January. In accordance with the spirit of the National Health Conference convened by the Central Military Commission in October last year and the North China Military Region's work policy for 1950, it established the work policy of "prevention first, treatment second" for this year and arranged the military medical unit health work plan for 1950, which will extensively carry out epidemic prevention and health care work in the troops.

At the meeting, the Minister of the Military Region Health Department summarized the work situation of the past year. It was explained that in the great transition from war to peace, the health work of the North China Military Region had achieved significant results. In the first half of last year, it supported the battles to liberate Beijing, Tianjin, Zhangjiakou, and Taiyuan, while also undertaking the huge task of receiving the wounded and sick during the large-scale westward and southward advances of the army. In the second half of the year, it shifted to post-war rehabilitation and peaceful construction work, such as rectifying organizations, paying attention to the treatment and accommodation of long-term and difficult-to-treat wounded and sick soldiers, carrying out epidemic prevention campaigns, and assisting local areas in establishing health agencies. However, the organizational structure of the leading organs is still incomplete, appearing passive and rushed, and bureaucracy and clericalism in some places still hinder us from better promoting overall work. The current situation requires us to quickly overcome the remaining guerrilla style and handicraft methods of work, establish a regular work system, strengthen organ work, and promote democracy in order to undertake the huge task of "ensuring the health of the National Defense Forces" in the future.

Next, he put forward five central requirements for the 1950 health administrative work plan: First, build the army's epidemic prevention and health care work, conduct health examinations, improve troop nutrition, actively carry out mass health movements, and ensure troop health. Second, universally improve the technical and theoretical level of existing staff, and prepare the foundation for future specialization. Third, build regularized hospitals, promote the glorious tradition of caring for the wounded and sick, and actively study and treat existing chronic diseases. Fourth, learn from the Soviet battlefield rescue work experience and improve the level of battlefield rescue work. Fifth, revise the standards for medicines and equipment, formulate regular work systems, and strengthen the management of medicines.

Finally, he emphasized: The "prevention first" policy is a long-term construction policy and a new work spirit, and it is necessary to change the past work style and establish a new work style. We must mobilize the strength of all health personnel and work together to complete this year's work plan. Secondly, it is necessary to closely coordinate the relationship between Party and government work. Health workers should closely cooperate with the requirements of Party and government work, use existing health organizations (such as health soldiers, health committee members in clubs, etc.), seize every opportunity to expand health publicity and education, and popularize health knowledge among the troops; then, according to the needs of commanders and fighters, gradually and with emphasis, establish organizations (such as health committees, etc.) and systems. At the same time, it is necessary to promptly summarize typical experiences, organize communication reports, widely promote them, and overcome the past practices and requirements of some people working alone and divorced from reality.

　　部队卫生工作方针  预防为主医疗为辅
    华北军区卫生部长提出今年五项要求
    【本报讯】华北军区卫生部于一月份召开了卫生行政干部会议。根据去年十月中央军委召开的全国卫生会议的精神和华北军区一九五○年工作方针，确定了本年以“预防为主、医疗为辅”的工作方针，布置了一九五○年军医部队卫生工作计划，将广泛开展部队防疫保健工作。
    会上，军区卫生部部长总述了去年一年工作情况。说明由战争转入和平的大转变过程中，华北军区的卫生工作获有重大成绩。去年上半年支援解放京、津、张、并诸战役，同时担负了大军西进、南下中巨大的伤病员收容任务。后半年则转入了战后的善后及和平建设工作，如整顿组织，注意长期难治的伤病员治疗与收容，开展防疫运动，协助地方建立卫生机关等。但领导机关组织还不健全，显得被动和忙乱，某些地方官僚主义和事务主义仍然妨碍着我们更好地推进全面工作。目前形势要求我们迅速克服残余的游击作风和手工业工作方法，要求树立正规的工作制度，加强机关工作，发扬民主，才能担负起今后“保障国防军的健康”的巨大任务。
    接着，他提出了一九五○年卫生行政工作计划的五个中心要求：一、建设本军防疫保健工作，进行健康检查，改进部队营养，积极开展群众性卫生运动，保障部队健康。二、普遍提高现有工作人员技术和理论水平，准备好今后向专科发展的基础。三、建设正规化类型医院，发扬爱护伤病员的光荣传统，积极钻研与治疗现有慢性病。四、学习苏联战场救护工作经验，提高战场救护工作的水平。五、修正药材装备标准，制订正规工作制度，加强药材管理。
    最后，他着重指出：“预防为主”的方针是长远建设的方针，是新的工作精神，必须转变过去的工作作风，建立新的工作作风。要动员全体卫生人员力量，共同努力完成今年工作计划。其次，要密切党政工作关系，卫生工作人员要密切配合党政工作要求，运用现有卫生组织（如卫生战士、俱乐部中卫生委员等），争取一切机会扩大卫生宣传教育，普及部队卫生知识；而后随着指战员的需要，逐渐而有重点地建立组织（如卫生委员会等）及制度。同时，要及时总结典型经验，组织通讯报导，广为推行，克服过去有些人单枪匹马，脱离现实的作法和要求。
