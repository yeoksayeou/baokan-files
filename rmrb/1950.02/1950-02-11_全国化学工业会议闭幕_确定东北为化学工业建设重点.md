　　Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, February 9th: The National Chemical Industry Conference, convened by the Ministry of Heavy Industry of the Central People's Government in Beijing starting January 26th, concluded successfully on February 7th after thirteen days. Attending the conference were over a hundred leading personnel from industrial departments and chemical industry departments of major administrative regions across the country, responsible individuals from major public and private chemical factories nationwide, as well as experts and professors. The conference heard reports on the state of the chemical industry in various regions, and working groups discussed the construction and production policies of China's chemical industry, production management systems, the allocation and training of technical personnel, and various existing technical problems. A production and construction plan for the chemical industry in 1950 was formulated.

　　Regarding the construction and production policies of China's chemical industry, the conference determined that the Northeast already possesses a foundation of equipment, and chemical industry construction should prioritize the Northeast while also taking into consideration North China and other regions. In terms of production, attention should be paid to the urgent needs of the national economy and the people's livelihood. Concerning the production tasks for 1950, the conference approved over eighty types of chemical industrial products for this year, among which the most important are fertilizer, caustic soda, and cement. Regarding the construction tasks for 1950, the conference decided to increase fertilizer production, such as developing phosphate mines in East China, adding equipment for producing intermediate raw materials for manufacturing dyes, such as chlorobenzene, carbolic acid, and aniline, to solve the dye shortage problem. In addition, a small factory utilizing natural soda to produce soda ash and caustic soda will be built in the Northwest region, and a large-scale refractory material factory will be built in the Central South region. Based on the aforementioned policies and tasks, the conference decided that the largest investment in chemical industry construction this year would be directed towards fertilizer industry construction.

　　**Decision to Implement Production and Sales Balance and Establish Economic Accounting System**

　　The conference focused on production management issues. The conference decided to implement a three-level system in management organizations: the Ministry of Heavy Industry of the Central Government will indirectly lead chemical enterprises through the industrial departments or their chemical industry bureaus of major administrative regions. The conference also decided to implement production and sales balance, economic accounting, and planned production, believing these to be several important conditions for completing this year's tasks. The conference pointed out that although it is not yet possible to achieve complete unified supply and marketing and planned production immediately, chemical enterprises in various regions should strengthen communication, cooperate with each other, exchange raw materials and market information, and gradually eliminate anarchy in production.

　　Regarding the allocation, cultivation, and training of technical staff in the chemical industry, the conference believed that the Northeast is currently the focus of chemical industry construction, but the region severely lacks technical personnel. A portion should be mobilized from within the customs (i.e., other parts of China) to the Northeast. In order to ensure that relocated personnel can work with peace of mind and exert their abilities, the Industrial Department of the Northeast People's Government is preparing to welcome the relocated personnel and take care of the lives and work of their families. At the same time, the conference emphasized that chemical enterprises in various regions should vigorously establish technical schools, training classes, and workers' night schools to cultivate and train technical personnel in a planned and organized manner. To meet current urgent needs, the conference decided to suggest that the education departments distribute second-year students of the chemical engineering departments of national universities across the country to factories to serve in advance, and then return to school to resume their studies after a certain period. In addition, the conference also discussed issues such as how to closely integrate research institutes, schools, and factories, how to utilize by-products and waste materials to reduce costs, and the safety and health facilities of chemical factories, and made decisions on all of them.

　　全国化学工业会议闭幕
    确定东北为化学工业建设重点
    【新华社北京九日电】中央人民政府重工业部一月二十六日起在京召开全国化学工业会议，前后历时十三天，已于二月七日圆满闭幕。参加会议的有全国各大行政区工业部门、化学工业部门和全国各大公私营化学工厂的负责人员，以及专家、教授等一百余人。会议听取了各地化学工业情况的汇报，并分组讨论了目前中国化学工业的建设和生产方针，生产管理制度，技术人员调配与培养，以及目前存在的各种技术问题，并订出了一九五○年化学工业的生产建设计划。
    关于目前中国化学工业的建设方针与生产方针，会议认为东北已有设备基础，化学工业的建设应以东北为重点，而同时兼顾华北及其他地区。至于生产方面，则应该注意国计民生的迫切需要。关于一九五○年的生产任务，会议通过今年化学工业的产品有八十余种，其中占主要地位的有肥田粉、烧碱、水泥等。关于一九五○年的建设任务，会议决定增加人造肥料生产，如开发华东的磷矿，增添生产制造染料的中间体原料如氯化苯、石炭酸、安尼林等设备，以解决缺乏染料问题。此外，并将在西北区建设一小型的利用天然碱制造纯碱与烧碱的工厂；在中南区建设一大规模的耐火材料厂。根据上述的方针任务，会议决定今年在建设化学工业上的投资，其中最大项目是投入肥料工业的建设。
    决定实行产销平衡建立经济核算制度
    会议着重讨论了生产管理问题。会议决定，在管理机构上实行三级制：即中央重工业部通过各大行政区工业部或其化工局间接领导各化工企业。会议并决定实行产销平衡、经济核算与计划生产，认为这是完成本年度任务的几个重要条件。会议指出，虽然目前还不能立刻做到完全统一供销与计划生产，但各地化工企业应加强联系，互相配合，交换原料与行情，逐渐消除生产上的无政府状态。
    关于化学工业技术员工的调配、培养与训练问题，会议认为东北为目前化学工业建设的重点，而该区技术人员十分缺乏，应从关内动员一部分到东北去。为了要使被调用人员能安心工作、发挥能力起见，东北人民政府工业部正准备迎接被调人员并照顾其眷属之生活和工作等。同时，会议强调各地化工企业要大力开办技术学校、训练班及工人夜校等，以便有计划有组织地培养与训练技术人材。为着适应目前急需，会议决定建议教育部分发全国各国立大学化工系二年级学生提前到工厂去服务，一定时期后再回校复学。此外会议还讨论了研究所、学校、工厂三者间如何密切结合问题、利用副产品及废料以减低成本问题以及化学工厂的安全与保健设施等问题，并均有所决定。
