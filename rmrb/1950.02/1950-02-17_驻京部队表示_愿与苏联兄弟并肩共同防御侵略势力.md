　　Troops Stationed in Beijing Express
    Willingness to Join Hands with Soviet Brothers to Jointly Defend Against Aggressive Forces
    When the news reached the barracks of the 1st Company of the Artillery Battalion and the 1st Company of the Guard Battalion of a certain division of the People's Liberation Army stationed in Beijing, the soldiers were overjoyed and unanimously expressed their sincere support, and immediately held a forum. Everyone eagerly spoke out their feelings about this great historical event. Everyone who spoke believed that China and the Soviet Union are the two major countries in the world, and the total population of the two countries accounts for more than one-third of the world's population; the close unity of these two major countries can consolidate the victory of the Chinese people and ensure world peace. Wang Degong, a soldier of the 1st Company of the Artillery Battalion, said, "We all support this treaty! Let the imperialists stare blankly! Our China and the Soviet Union are tightly united, who would dare to bully us again?" Most of the soldiers of the two companies were from peasant backgrounds, and they all hoped to transform the backward agricultural country into an advanced industrial country. Today, when everyone heard that China and the Soviet Union had signed a treaty of friendship, alliance and mutual assistance, and that the Soviet Union had promised to provide loans to China, they all felt that this was a strong guarantee for China's industrialization. They also firmly stated that they will intensify their studies in the future and strive to make the Chinese People's Liberation Army a strong and modern national defense force, and together with the Soviet brotherly troops, jointly defend against the resurgence of aggressive forces.

　　驻京部队表示
    愿与苏联兄弟并肩共同防御侵略势力
    消息传到驻京中国人民解放军某师炮兵营一连和某师警卫营一连的营房中，战士们听了都欢欣若狂，一致表示竭诚拥护，并立即举行座谈会。大家争先恐后地说出对这一伟大历史事件的感想。每一个发言的人都认为：中苏是世界上的两个大国，两国人口的总数占了全世界的三分之一还多；这两个大国紧密地团结起来，就可以巩固中国人民的胜利，保障世界的和平。炮兵营一连战士王德功说：“咱都拥护这个条约！叫帝国主义者白瞪眼吧！我们中国和苏联抱得紧紧的，谁还敢再欺侮咱们。”两连的战士大多出身农民，都希望把落后的农业国变为先进的工业国，今天大家听见中苏缔结了友好同盟互助条约，苏联答应贷款给中国，都觉得这是中国工业化的有力保证。他们并坚决表示：今后要加紧学习，努力使中国人民解放军成为一支强大的近代化的国防军，和苏联兄弟部队在一起，共同防御侵略势力的再起。
