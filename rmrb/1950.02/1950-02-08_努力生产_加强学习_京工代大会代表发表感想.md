　　Strive for Production, Strengthen Learning
    Delegates to the Beijing Workers' Congress Express Their Thoughts
    [Beijing News] After the closing of the first Beijing Municipal Workers' Congress, the delegates expressed that they had gained a lot from the meeting and further clarified that the central task of the trade union is production. They will convey the spirit and resolutions of the congress to all workers in the city.
  Zhang Zhenmin of the Electric Power Bureau
    Zhang Zhenmin, a model worker of the Beijing Electric Power Bureau and a specially invited delegate to the Workers' Congress, said, "I have remembered the words of Comrades Peng Zhen and Xiao Ming. The central task of our trade union is production. I myself am from a working-class background and have now been promoted to Deputy Chief of the Outside Line Section of the Engineering Department, and I have also been elected as a labor hero by everyone. I will definitely take the lead in guiding everyone to work hard and fully guarantee the supply of electricity for Beijing's industry and the city's lighting. On the day the congress closed, Comrade Peng Zhen also came to the delegate席 after his speech and sat next to me. I was deeply moved. I looked at him with great respect. When it was time for free speeches, he readily said to me, 'You should say a few words too.' I blushed and said, 'I am a rough man, good at working and uniting people, but I don't dare to speak at the congress.' Comrade Peng Zhen encouraged me for a long time. Really, we workers should strengthen our study of culture, politics, and technology. I plan to go to an amateur school to study." He stated: The Municipal Federation of Trade Unions has been officially established, and Peng Zhen, Secretary of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, and Liu Ren, Deputy Secretary, have been elected as Chairman and Vice Chairman, which is very appropriate. In the future, trade union work will be greatly developed.
    Qiu Fangyu of the Construction Bureau
    Qiu Fangyu, a trade union representative from the Engineering Corps of the Beijing Construction Bureau, said: Comrade Peng Zhen repeatedly told us at the meeting that the central task of trade union work is production; only in this way can trade union work have rich content. Comrade Peng Zhen pointed out that municipal construction is also one of Beijing's work tasks this year. The workers of our Engineering Corps of the Construction Bureau will work hard this year to build sewers and roads and resolutely complete our 1950 engineering plan. Several of our representatives are preparing to convey the spirit and resolutions of the congress to all workers.
    Ying Yongxing of the Beijing Machine Factory
    Ying Yongxing, a representative from the Beijing Machine Factory, said: "In the past, the trade union work in our factory did not pay enough attention to production and failed to guarantee the completion of production tasks. After listening to the reports of the leaders at this conference, I not only gained a lot of knowledge, but also deeply realized the shortcomings of the trade union work in my factory. I know that the central task of the trade union is production, and workers' welfare and production are inseparable. In the future, we must carry out all our work in accordance with the instructions of the leaders and the spirit of the congress, in order to restore and develop production."
    Li Shuyu of the Qinghe Woolen Mill
    Li Shuyu, a model female worker from the Qinghe Woolen Mill, said, "My education level is not high, and I don't understand many things about the conference. However, one thing impressed me deeply, which is what Comrade Peng Zhen said: the central task of the trade union is, first, production, second, production, and third, still production. I didn't work hard at learning before, and I didn't think that learning would help production. At this conference, after hearing the leaders call for learning, I realized the importance of learning for production." She expressed her intention to work hard at learning in addition to working hard at production in the future.
    [Another dispatch] Wang Feng, a representative of workers in the private rubber industry, conveyed the proceedings and resolutions of the first Workers' Congress to the workers of the Xinhua Rubber Factory yesterday (7th). The workers believe that the motions passed by the congress to sign collective contracts with public factories and to solve the problems of unemployed employees are in line with the current interests of Beijing workers and the long-term interests of the working class. Everyone was moved by Commander-in-Chief Zhu's speech, Comrade Peng Zhen's straightforward and truthful speech, and Comrade Peng Zhen and Mayor Nie's invitation to the workers' representatives to eat together. They expressed their firm response to Comrade Peng Zhen's call to "conditionally launch a production competition movement in private factories that produce essential goods for the people's livelihood" to increase output, improve quality, reduce costs, and complete this year's production plan.

　　努力生产·加强学习
    京工代大会代表发表感想
    【北京讯】北京市首届工人代表大会闭幕后，代表们都表示在这次会上得到不少的收获，更进一步明确认识到工会的中心任务是生产。他们将把大会的精神和决议，传达给全市工人。
  电业局张振民
    工代会特请代表、北京电业局劳动模范张振民说：“我把彭真同志、萧明同志讲的话都记住了。我们工会的中心任务，就是生产。我自己是工人出身，现在被提升为工务科外线股副股长，还被大家选做劳动英雄。我一定更要带头领着大家伙干，充分地保证供应北京的工业用电和全市的光明。大会闭幕那天，彭真同志讲完了话也到代表席上来，坐在我旁边，我感动极了。我很敬仰地望着他。到自由讲话时，他爽快地对我说：“你也去说两句”。我红着脸说：“我是老粗，干活儿行，团结人也行，就是不敢在大会上说话。”彭真同志鼓励我半天。真的，我们工人实在应该加强学习文化、政治和技术。我准备到业余学校去学习。”他表示：市总工会正式成立了，中国共产党北京市委会书记彭真、副书记刘仁当选了正、副主席，这合适极了。以后，工会工作将会更大大开展了。
    建设局仇方域
    北京建设局工程总队工会代表仇方域说：彭真同志在会上再三地告诉我们，工会工作的中心任务就是生产；只有这样，工会工作才会有丰富的内容。彭真同志指出市政建设也是北京市今年工作任务之一，我们建设局工程总队工人今年就要在修建下水道和道路上努力工作，坚决完成我们一九五○年工程计划。我们几个代表准备向全体工友传达大会精神和决议。
    北京机器厂英永兴
    北京机器厂代表英永兴说：“以前我们厂子里的工会工作，对生产不够重视，没有很好地保证完成生产任务。这次在大会上听了各首长的报告，不只使自己长了很多知识，而且使自己深刻地认识到自己厂子里工会工作的缺点。知道工会的中心任务是生产，工人福利和生产是分不开的。今后一定要根据首长们的指示和大会精神，为恢复与发展生产，进行一切工作。”
    清河制呢厂李淑玉
    清河制呢厂劳动模范女工李淑玉说：“自己文化程度不高，对大会有许多东西了解不够。但是有一件事印象特别深，就是彭真同志所说的：工会的中心任务，第一是生产，第二是生产，第三还是生产。我以前对学习不大努力，觉得学习对生产没有帮助。这次在大会上，听到首长们号召学习，才认识到学习对生产的重要。”她表示准备今后除努力生产外，还要努力学习。
    【又讯】私营橡胶业工人代表王锋昨（七）日向新华橡胶厂工人传达首届工代大会的经过和决议。工人们认为大会通过公营工厂订立集体合同和解决失业员工等议案，既符合目前北京工人的利益，也符合工人阶级长远的利益。大家对朱总司令到场讲话和彭真同志直率真实的讲话，以及彭真同志和聂市长宴请工人代表在一起吃饭等，都很感动，表示坚决响应彭真同志关于“在生产民生必需品的私营工厂有条件地开展生产竞赛运动”的号召，以增加产量，提高质量，减低成本，并完成今年的生产计划。
