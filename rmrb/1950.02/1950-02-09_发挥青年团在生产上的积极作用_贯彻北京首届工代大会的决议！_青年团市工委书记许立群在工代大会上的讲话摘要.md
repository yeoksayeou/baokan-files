There are already more than 4,000 Youth League members in Beijing's factories. The Garment Factory and the People's Printing Factory of China each have more than 700 members. Generally, youth league organizations have been established in factories with more than 30 people in the city. Youth League members in factories generally play a model role in production.

Some workers are not very clear about the relationship between the Youth League and the workers. The Youth League is an advanced youth organization led by the Chinese Communist Party with the goal of thoroughly realizing New Democracy. Since it is led by the Communist Party—the vanguard of the working class—it has an inseparable relationship with the interests of the working class. In addition, advanced young workers are one of its main components, and many of the children, younger siblings, and relatives of adult workers are active backbones of the Youth League, showing how close its relationship with the working class is!

The Youth League is an assistant to the Communist Party and the government and is the Communist Party's reserve force. Currently, the Party and the government regard restoring and developing production as the primary task. Therefore, all work of the Youth League in factories should revolve around production. At present, Youth League members in public factories must, under the leadership of the Party and administration and with the help of the trade union, participate in launching production campaigns to increase output, improve quality, and reduce costs. In private factories, production campaigns should be launched conditionally under the leadership of the Party. This is the overriding central task. At the same time, they should do their best in political, technical, and cultural learning, and in promoting the welfare and recreational activities of young workers.

Youth League members should play a model and leading role among young people, but they must not forget that they are assistants to the Party and administration. This glorious role as assistant to the Party and government must be well combined with the core role of uniting young people and the vanguard role in order to correctly exert the positive role of the Youth League. That is to say, Youth League members should fully exert the youth's shock role and leading role in completing the role of Party and government assistants and in ensuring the implementation of the correct resolutions of the trade union.

Therefore, in terms of production campaigns in public factories, the Youth League must obtain the leadership of the Party, the agreement of the administration, and the approval and response of adult workers when deciding on its tasks, and should respond to the call of the trade union. In private factories, it must obtain the leadership of the Party and the assistance of the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions.

As long as Youth League members receive good leadership, they can play a significant role in production. The Youth League members in Beijing, whether in the overhaul of Boiler No. 14 in the power plant, the movement to improve output and quality in the Garment Factory and the People's Printing Factory of China and other factories, or in participating in the factory security team and enlivening the factory's cultural and recreational life, have played a significant role. Naturally, shortcomings have also arisen, that is, in the early stages, there was a phenomenon of insufficient production awareness, and after correction, there was a tendency to simply strengthen labor intensity and rely on purely increasing physical exertion to promote production. Later, the formulation of individual production plans was further promoted, but it was mainly limited to paying attention to improving technology (including improving individual technical level and some possible rationalization suggestions. This is naturally very important for young people). Now that the Workers' Congress has been held, the administration of each factory will formulate a production plan, and the formulation of individual production plans for League members will have a basis and will be able to exert greater strength in production. Secondly, in the past, the leadership of the League provided insufficient assistance. Currently, the task of strengthening internal League education and strengthening branch work in order to better exert the positive role of the League in production has been put on the agenda.

It is hoped that all parties, especially the adult workers, will help the factory's Youth League more so that it can better play the positive role of young workers in production under the leadership and assistance of the Party and the government. And the main task of the Beijing Municipal Factory Youth League at present is to convey the resolutions of the first Beijing Municipal Workers' Congress to young workers and to fully implement the resolutions of the Congress.

　　发挥青年团在生产上的积极作用  贯彻北京首届工代大会的决议！
    青年团市工委书记许立群在工代大会上的讲话摘要
    北京市工厂青年团员已有四千多人，在被服厂、中国人民印刷厂都有了七百以上的团员。全市三十人以上的工厂一般都建立了团的组织。工厂中的青年团员一般都能在生产中起模范作用。
    有的工人还不很明白青年团与工人的关系。青年团是中国共产党领导的、以彻底实现新民主主义为目标的先进青年组织。它既是共产党——工人阶级先锋队所领导的，它和工人阶级利益就有着不可分离的关系了。此外，先进的工人青年是它的主要成分之一，许多成年工人的子女弟妹都是青年团的积极骨干，可见它与工人阶级的关系是如何的亲密！
    青年团是共产党和政府的助手，是共产党的后备军。当前党和政府都把恢复与发展生产当作首要任务，因此，青年团在工厂中的工作一切都应围绕生产而进行。当前公营工厂的青年团员必须在党与行政领导下，在工会帮助下，参加发动增加产量、提高质量、减低成本的生产竞赛。私营工厂则在党领导下有条件地发动生产竞赛。这是压倒一切的中心任务。同时在政治、技术、文化学习中，在促进青年工人的生活福利康乐活动中，也要尽出自己的力量。
    青年团员应在青年群众中起模范作用与带头作用，但必须不能忘记自己是党与行政的助手。必须把这一种光荣的党政助手的作用，与团结青年群众的核心作用和先锋作用很好地结合起来，才能正确地发挥青年团的积极作用。这就是说：青年团员应该在完成党政助手作用方面，在保证执行工会正确决议方面，充分发挥青年的突击作用与带头作用。
    因此，在公营工厂的生产运动方面，青年团在决定自己的任务时，必须获得党的领导，行政的同意，和成年工人的赞同以及响应工会的号召。在私营工厂中则必须得到党的领导和市总工会的帮助。
    青年团员只要得到良好的领导，就能在生产中起不小的作用。北京市的青年团员，不论是发电厂的大修十四号炉，被服厂和中国人民印刷厂以及其他工厂的提高产量质量的运动中，或者是参加工厂保卫队和活跃工厂文娱生活上，都有着显著的作用。自然，也产生过缺点，即在初期有过生产观念不够明确的现象，在改正以后，又偏于单纯加强劳动强度，靠单纯增加体力的支出来推动生产。后来进一步推行了制订个人生产计划，但主要只能比较局限于注意提高技术（包括提高个人技术水平与某些可能的合理化建议。对于青年来说，这自然是十分重要的）。现在工代大会开会后，各厂行政上都要订出生产计划了，团员个人生产计划的制订，就有所根据，并能在生产上发挥更大的力量了。其次，过去团的领导上帮助还很不够，到目前，加强团内教育，加强支部工作，以便更好地在生产上发挥团的积极作用的任务，已提到日程上来了。
    希望各方面，特别是成年工人群众，多帮助工厂青年团，使它在党、政领导与帮助下更好地发挥青年工人在生产上的积极作用。而目前北京市工厂青年团的主要任务就是在青年工人中传达北京市首届工代大会的决议，并全力贯彻执行大会的决议。
