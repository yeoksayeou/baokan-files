　　Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, February 25th: The heroic anti-bombing struggle of the Shanghai working class and all citizens has received strong support from workers, soldiers, students, and people from all walks of life across the country. The Radio Factory Branch of the Nanjing Hardware Workers' Union, in addition to donating over 1.5 million RMB, also sent a letter of condolence to the Shanghai worker brothers saying: "We will always remember the series of atrocities committed in Shanghai by the American imperialists and the remnant Kuomintang bandits who are enemies of the Chinese people to the end. We are determined to respond to these atrocities by stepping up production and ensuring the completion of the shock tasks assigned to us by the higher authorities. We will definitely dedicate ourselves to the unified production front, closely unite under the banner of Chairman Mao, and fight to the end to swiftly eliminate our common enemy!" The Preparatory Committee of the Jiangxi Provincial Federation of Trade Unions' letter of condolence said: "We firmly believe that the bloody and insane atrocities of the US-Chiang clique in massacring our people cannot in the slightest shake our firm belief in building a new Shanghai or stop our determination to advance towards Taiwan, Tibet, Hainan Island, the Zhoushan Islands, and other places; we must turn grief into strength, unite as one to quickly eliminate the remaining bandits, and avenge the dead worker brothers and sisters!" Company 1 of the artillery battalion of a certain division of the People's Liberation Army wrote in a letter to all compatriots in Shanghai: "We will intensify military training and be prepared to liberate Taiwan and eliminate the remaining bandits to avenge the dead!" The All-China Drama Workers Association and all natural science workers in Zhejiang Province sent letters of condolence to the families of the deceased compatriots. The Nanjing East China Military and Political University also organized a delegation to Shanghai to offer condolences.
