East China Military Region

    Determined to Intensify Preparations to Liberate Taiwan at an Early Date

    The Political Department of the East China Military Region and the Third Field Army also issued instructions ordering the entire army to organize newspaper reading, hold celebrations, and conduct two weeks of education in conjunction with the current work of each unit. The People's Front News, published by the Military Region and the Field Army Political Department, stated in its editorial "Supporting the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance, and Mutual Assistance": "All commanders and fighters of our army must be urgently mobilized to intensify full preparations, and strive to liberate Taiwan, unify all of China, complete victory, and consolidate victory. This is the best expression of our celebration of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance, and Mutual Assistance." General Su Yu, Deputy Commander of the Third Field Army, said in a statement: "This is not only a major event in Chinese history, but also in world history. The Soviet Union helps the Chinese people in all aspects to heal the wounds caused by the long-term destruction by US imperialism and the Chiang Kai-shek bandits, and to restore construction, which demonstrates the profound friendship of the Soviet people towards the Chinese people, and the great internationalist spirit of the Soviet people." All personnel of a certain unit of the East China Navy attentively listened to the report on the treaty and agreement in front of the radio and took careful notes. The Nanjing Garrison Command printed a large number of copies of the full text of the treaty and the Xinhua News Agency editorial and distributed them to various units. Many soldiers immediately disguised themselves and went to the streets to carry out propaganda. A certain regiment also held a thousand-person celebration parade. When the factories of the Logistics Department of the East China Military Region and the Third Field Army received the extra edition of the newspaper, the factory directors immediately ordered a ten-minute work stoppage to express celebration, and the factories immediately resounded with deafening gongs, drums, and firecrackers. Yang Chongfu, chairman of the trade union of the Fourth Clothing Factory, called on all workers to redouble their efforts in production to support the army in liberating Taiwan at an early date. When the good news was broadcast to a certain corps of the Third Field Army, the commanders and fighters of each unit immediately crowded around the radio. Each time a document was broadcast, enthusiastic applause erupted in the crowd, and the commanders and fighters excitedly shouted: "Long live the Sino-Soviet Friendship and Mutual Assistance Alliance!" "Long live Marshal Stalin!" "Long live Chairman Mao!" Song Shilun, commander of the corps, said: "All our commanders and fighters should intensify preparations with the highest enthusiasm and confidence, and together with the fraternal corps, celebrate the signing of this treaty with practical actions to liberate Taiwan and liberate all of East China as soon as possible." Cai Xiao, a regiment leader from Taiwan, said: "This good news is a great encouragement to the six million people of Taiwan."
    Before the treaty was announced, the commanders and fighters of the People's Liberation Army in North China looked forward to the release of the good news every day, and many soldiers ran to the company headquarters several times a day to inquire about good news. On the morning of the 15th, when the Central People's Broadcasting Station issued a pre-announcement of the good news, the entire army rejoiced, and all the telephones were busy spreading the good news to every company. Jeeps and cavalry messengers sped from one village to another with the good news. Wherever there were radios, a large number of people were attracted. A certain unit stationed near the Lugou Bridge moved the radio to the top of Wanping City, so that all the soldiers and civilians in the city could hear the good news. Many units immediately convened party committees for discussion after listening to the broadcast. Many of the leaders of the units immediately went to the companies to explain to the soldiers. A soldier from the artillery battalion of a certain division who was liberated in the Shenyang campaign said: "Let the imperialists stare blankly! The arms of the Chinese and Soviet people are linked even more closely. Whoever dares to bully us will be battered and bloody!" The soldiers of a certain division said: "The Soviet Union is helping us like this, we can't just wait to eat and drink, we must straighten our backs even harder and work harder!"

　　华东军区
    决心加紧准备  早日解放台湾
    华东军区暨第三野战军政治部，也发出指示，命令全军组织读报，举行庆祝，并结合各部队当前工作进行两星期的教育。军区和野战军政治部出版的人民前线报，在“拥护中苏友好同盟互助条约”的社论中说：“我全军指战员必须紧张地动员起来，加紧作充分的准备，为解放台湾统一全中国、完成胜利和巩固胜利而奋斗。这就是我们庆祝中苏友好同盟互助条约的一个最好的表示。”第三野战军副司令员粟裕将军发表谈话说：“这不仅在中国历史上，而且在世界历史上都是一件大事。苏联从各方面来帮助中国人民医治被美帝和蒋匪长期破坏的创伤，恢复建设，说明了苏联人民对于中国人民深厚的友谊，和苏联人民的伟大的国际主义精神。”华东海军某部全体人员，在收音机面前凝神静听关于条约和协定的报告，并认真地作了笔记。南京警备部队大量赶印条约全文和新华社社论发到各部。许多战士立即化装到街头作宣传。某团也举行了千人庆祝大游行。华东军区暨三野后勤部各工厂接到报纸的号外时，各厂长立即下令停工十分钟表示庆祝，各工厂马上响起了震耳的锣鼓声和鞭炮声。第四被服厂工会主任杨崇福，号召全体工友加倍努力生产，支援大军早日解放台湾。当收音机把这一喜讯传到三野某兵团时，各单位的指战员们马上拥挤到收音机的周围，每播完一个文件，人群中间立刻爆发了热烈鼓掌声，指战员们兴奋地高呼：“中苏友好互助同盟万岁！”“斯大林大元帅万岁！”“毛主席万岁！”该兵团司令员宋时轮将军说：“我们全体指战员，应以最高度的热情和信心，加紧准备，与各兄弟兵团一道，以提早解放台湾，解放全华东的实际行动，来庆祝这一条约的签订。”台湾籍的蔡啸团长说：“这个喜讯，特别对台湾六百万人民是一个莫大的鼓舞。”
    全华北的人民解放军指战员们，在条约没有公布前，天天盼望着喜讯的发布，很多战士们一日数次地跑到连部打听好消息。十五日晨，当中央人民广播电台发出喜讯预告时，全军欢腾，所有的电话机都忙碌地传布这一好消息到每个连队。吉普汽车和骑兵通讯员，带着喜讯从这一个村飞驰到那一个村。凡是有收音机的处所，都吸引了一大堆的人。驻防在芦沟桥畔的某部，把收音机搬到宛平城头，让全城军民都能够听到这一喜讯。许多部队在听完广播后，马上召开党委会进行讨论。部队的首长们很多立刻就到连队去给战士们进行讲解。某师炮兵营的一个在沈阳战役被解放过来的战士说：“叫帝国主义干瞪眼吧！中苏两国人民的胳膀挽得更加紧了。谁敢欺负咱们，他就碰得头破血流！”某师战士们表示：苏联这样帮助，咱们可不能等着吃、等着喝，要把腰板子挺得更硬，加劲地干啊！
