Two Worlds
——Two Paths of Economic Development
    Translated by Cui Ping
    The report by the Central Statistical Bureau of the Council of Ministers of the USSR on the summary of 1949 (the original text of which is found in the appended materials of this issue of "New Times" magazine) is new documentary evidence of the great power of the Soviet socialist system, and also documentary evidence of the immeasurable and significant superiority of this system over the capitalist system. The language of facts is the most eloquent language.
    What do the facts and figures in the Central Statistical Bureau's report illustrate?
    First, they prove once again the enormous real power of the Soviet Union's national economic development plan, which stipulates extremely high rates of economic development unheard of in the capitalist world. The situation in 1949, for example, was particularly evident in this regard. Because the Soviet government implemented a series of measures in 1949 to continue improving industrial construction, it was possible to expand the original annual production plan. And this expanded 1949 plan was fulfilled by 103 percent in the entire industry. This means that the Soviet state obtained from its industry a large amount of various industrial products exceeding the plan—from hardware, coal, oil, machine tools, automobiles, and other machines to meat, butter, sugar, tea, as well as textiles, leather shoes, cameras, and many other consumer goods.
    Second, the summary of 1949 proves that the Soviet planned economy is developing firmly in accordance with the laws of socialist expanded reproduction; our industrial and agricultural products, freight volume, and the capacity of basic construction in the national economy are all increasing substantially season after season and year after year. This was the case before the war. This has been the case in the first few years of the post-war Five-Year Plan. This was also the case in 1949. The total volume of Soviet industrial products in 1949 increased by 20 percent compared to 1948, and by 41 percent compared to 1940 before the war. By the end of 1949, the output of industrial products had already exceeded the level stipulated in the Five-Year Plan to be completed in 1950;
    The total output of agricultural products in 1949 exceeded the pre-war level of 1940. The grain harvest was 7.6 billion poods (one pood equals 36 pounds), exceeding the 1940 level and nearly reaching the scale stipulated in the Five-Year Plan to be completed in 1950. The number of livestock on collective farms has also increased significantly (cattle increased by 27 percent, pigs—78 percent, etc.), greatly exceeding the pre-war level of 1940;
    The volume of freight carried by various means of transportation in 1949 increased by 15 to 28 percent, significantly exceeding the 1940 level;
    The capacity of basic construction in the national economy increased by 20 percent in 1949. In the four post-war years (1946-1949), 5,200 state-owned industrial enterprises were built, restored, and put into operation, not counting the small state-owned and cooperative enterprises.
    These few figures alone clearly show the great achievements of the Soviet socialist economy and its forward-developing strength. At the same time, the summary of 1949 also pointed out the scale of technological progress, which is invariably a characteristic of all sectors of the Soviet national economy. It is enough to point out the fact that in 1949 alone, Soviet industry itself manufactured and installed more than 300 of the latest constructions of the most productive machines and machinery. The adoption and development of new and advanced working methods have become a truly national undertaking in the Soviet national economy; this can be seen from the fact that in 1949, more than 450,000 new inventions and rationalization proposals created by workers, engineers, and technicians were adopted in industry.
    Again, the summary of 1949 proves that in the Soviet Union, not only in industry and transportation, but also in agriculture, there is solid and far-reaching technological progress; the technological arming of agriculture is developing rapidly with the growth of socialist industry. In the early years of the 20th century, Lenin hoped that there would come a time when the Soviet regime could arm the agriculture of the Soviet state with 100,000 tractors. And now, in 1949 alone, the Soviet state was able to use 150,000 tractors, 29,000 combine harvesters, 64,000 trucks, more than 1.6 million automatic tractors, and other agricultural machinery in agriculture.
    Finally, the summary of 1949, again proves that in the Soviet socialist country, the development of productive forces, the growth of industrial and agricultural production, and the increase in national income all mean an increase in people's income and an improvement in the happiness of all people and every Soviet family and every individual worker. The continued improvement of the material and cultural standards of the people is the law of development of socialist society. The summary of 1949 pointed out the surge in Soviet national income: an increase of 17 percent compared to 1948, and a strong increase of 36 percent compared to 1940 before the war. The income of the people has also greatly increased with the growth of national income. Calculated by the income of a worker, the income of steelworkers is 12 percent more than in 1948, and the income of farmers is 14 percent more than in 1948. Compared with 1940, the income of workers and farmers has increased by 24 percent and 30 percent respectively.
    The material well-being of socialism felt by all Soviet people is great and multi-faceted. They are not limited to the growth of workers' wages, and the increase in the income of farmers in general collective economies and individual economies. All subsidies and payments for employee social insurance, remuneration during vacations, pensions provided by social security, free certificates for rest homes and sanatoriums, free medical assistance, and various other payments and preferential conditions are borne by the state--this is a prominent feature of the socialist system. In 1949 alone, the total amount of these benefits and payments received by the Soviet people exceeded 110 billion rubles--almost three times more than in 1940.
    There are many other facts and figures that can prove the improvement of people's happiness. The amount of food sold to the people in 1949 was 17 percent more than in 1948, and the amount of industrial products sold to the people was 25 percent more than in 1948. The number of employees in the national economy increased by 1.8 million. 723,000 young men and women graduated from industrial schools and railway schools or completed training in factory schools, and were assigned to work in industry, construction, or transportation.
    A series of facts and figures indicating the continuous growth of the material and cultural living standards of the people in 1949 can be greatly continued. This growth is manifested in the large increase in housing, schools, hospitals, and other buildings, and in the scale of welfare undertakings in cities and villages; it is also manifested in the number of students in ordinary schools and technical schools, which increased by nearly 2 million in one year, while the number of college students reached 1,128,000; it is also manifested in the huge expansion of graduate schools and many other aspects.
    This is the summary of the development of the Soviet socialist economy, its achievements and accomplishments in 1949. Is it wise for the monopoly capitalist newspapers to try to obliterate these brilliant summaries? A simple comparison of the data on the Soviet national economy with the data on the economic situation of any capitalist country (the United States or the United Kingdom) will pass a severe judgment on the capitalist system in the comparison itself. The comparative summary of 1949 made a new and significant confirmation of Comrade Stalin's profound conclusion, which is:
    "The bankrupt and fragile capitalist economic system has reached its end and must give way to another, higher, Soviet, socialist economic system; the only economic system that is not afraid of crises and can overcome the difficulties that capitalism finds difficult to solve is the Soviet economic system."
    In fact, can even the richest country in the capitalist world--the United States--compare with the achievements of the Soviet economy today?
    The United States' production decreased by 22 percent in one year (October 1948-October 1949); even according to the official economic review from the White House, investment in industry decreased by 15 percent in 1949, and investment in automobiles and water transportation decreased by 27 percent; according to the assessment admitted by the White House economic observers, wages and people's income decreased quarter by quarter. In particular, the total income of farmers decreased by 2.8 billion U.S. dollars, and their net income decreased even more; people's savings decreased sharply--decreasing by 3.1 billion U.S. dollars in one year.
    In this way, almost the entire economic phenomenon is manifested as decline, shrinkage, reduction, recession, and so on. It is true that there are also places where growth is manifested. But these growths are unemployment, national debt, military spending, and the excess profits of monopoly capitalists. Even according to official data, the number of completely unemployed people in the United States increased by 64 percent in one year. The national debt of the United States increased by 5.4 billion U.S. dollars. The cost of undisguised arms race and foreign aggression policies alone increased by nearly 3 billion U.S. dollars compared to the record in 1948. Following the growth of the profits of monopoly groups is the impoverishment of the masses, most of whom produce tools of war and human extermination. The profits of large companies increased by 35-50 percent.
    In the United Kingdom, France, and other capitalist countries, the picture of economic depression is no less than this, and the poverty of the majority of the masses in these countries is even more serious. The following two points give people a disastrous concept of these pictures.
    First, the capitalist countries of Western Europe have not exceeded the level of industrial production in 1929 in the past 20 years; while the Soviet Union has increased its industrial production by nine times in these 20 years, including the most difficult years of its war history.
    Second, unemployment has been eradicated in the Soviet Union once and for all. In the report on the summary of the Soviet economic development in 1949, there is a simple report: "There has been no unemployment in the country in 1949 and in the years before it." At the same time, in capitalist countries, the number of fully unemployed and underemployed people exceeds 40 million. Forty million unemployed and underemployed people! This is the tragedy of forty million men, women, old and young, poor and hungry.
    This is the bourgeois world today, a world struggling in a new and brutal economic crisis, which cannot be weakened and prevented by any plans and prescriptions of capitalist doctors. More disasters can be foreseen in its tomorrow. Because capitalism has no future. In the whole world, the future, the bright future, belongs to socialism, now belongs to the Soviet Union and the People's Democracies of Europe and Asia rising under the banner of Lenin-Stalin. The scientific analysis of the history of the last century inevitably leads to such a conclusion. This conclusion also suggests a comparative analysis of the two routes of economic development--the socialist world and the capitalist world.

　　两个世界
　　——经济发展的两条路线

    苏联部长会议所属中央统计局关于一九四九年总结的报道（其原文见于本期“新时代”杂志的附录资料）是苏维埃社会主义制度伟大力量的新的文件证据，也是这一制度比资本主义制度不可计量的、显著的优越性的文件证据。事实的语言是最雄辩的语言。
    中央统计局报道中的事实和数字说明了些什么呢？
    首先，它们又一次地证明了苏联发展国民经济的国家计划具有巨大的现实力量，这种国家计划里规定着非常高度的、在资本主义世界里从未听闻过的经济发展的速度。例如一九四九年的情形在这一方面表现得特别明显。因为苏维埃政府在一九四九年实行了一系列的继续改进工业建设的措施，所以它有可能扩大原先确定下的一年生产计划。而这一个扩大的一九四九年的计划，在整个工业中执行了百分之一○三。这就意味着苏维埃国家从自己的工业中获得了超过计划的大量的各种各样的工业品--从五金、煤、石油、母机、汽车和其他各种机器到肉、牛油、白糖、茶叶，以及纺织品、皮鞋、照相机和许多其他广大消费物品。
    其次，一九四九年的总结证明了苏维埃的计划经济是坚定不移地循着社会主义扩大再生产的法则发展着的；我们的工业品和农业品，货物运输量和国民经济中基本建设的容量都是季复一季、年复一年地大量增加着。战争以前是如此。在战后五年计划的头几年是如此。在一九四九年也是如此。一九四九年苏联工业品的总量比一九四八年增加了百分之二十，比战争以前的一九四○年增加了百分之四十一。到一九四九年末工业品的产量已经超过了规定在一九五○年完成的五年计划的水准；
    一九四九年农业品的总产量超过了战前一九四○年的水准。谷物收获是七十六亿普德（一普德等于三十六磅），超过了一九四○年的水准，而且差不多达到了规定在一九五○年完成的五年计划的规模。集体农场里牲畜的匹数也有许多增加（牛增加百分之二七，猪--百分之七八等等），大大超过了战前一九四○年的水准；
    一九四九年各种运输工具的货物运载量增加了百分之十五到二十八，大大地超过了一九四○年的水准；
    国民经济中基本建设的容量在一九四九年增加了百分之二十。在战后四年中（一九四六--一九四九）建设了、恢复了并开工了五千二百个国营的工业企业，而那些小的国营的和合作社的企业还不计算在内。
    单只这一点不多的数字已经很明确地显示了苏联社会主义经济的伟大成就及其向前发展的力量。同时一九四九年的总结也指出了技术进步的规模，这是无例外地成为苏联国民经济一切部门的特点。只要指出下面一点事实就足够了，那就是仅只在一九四九年一年之内，苏维埃工业自己制造并设置了三百个以上生产力最高的机器和机械的最新构造。新的、先进的工作方法的采用和发展，在苏维埃国民经济中成为真正全民的事业；只须从下面一件事情上就可以看到这一点，那就是在一九四九年工业上采用了工人们、工程师们、技师们所创制的四十五万种以上的新发明和合理化的建议。
    复次，一九四九年的总结又证明了在苏联不止在工业上和运输上而且在农业上，都有着坚实的和深远的技术上的进步；在农业上的技术的武装，是随着社会主义工业的增长而猛烈地发展着。在二十世纪开始的那几年，列宁就希望有那么一个时候，苏维埃政权能用十万架拖拉机来武装苏维埃国家的农业。而现在，仅只在一九四九年一年之内，苏维埃国家就能够在农业上使用十五万架拖拉机，两万九千架联合耕种机，六万四千架载重汽车，一百六十万架以上的自动牵引机以及其他农业机器。
    最后，一九四九年的总结，重新证明了在苏维埃社会主义国家里，生产力的发展、工业和农业生产的增长，国民收入的增加，都是意味着人民收入的增加，全体人民和每一个苏维埃家庭，每一个个别劳动者的幸福的增进。人民大众的物质文化水准的继续提高是社会主义社会发展的法则。一九四九年的总结指出苏联国民收入的激增：比一九四八年增加百分之十七，比战前的一九四○年增加百分之三十六强。人民的所得也跟着国民收入的增长而大为提高。按照一个工作者的收入来计算，炼钢业的职工收入比一九四八年多百分之十二，农民的收入比一九四八年多百分之十四。同一九四○年比较，工人和农民的收入，前者增加百分之二四，后者增加百分之三十。
    全体苏联人民所感觉到的社会主义的物质幸福是伟大的，多方面的。它们不局限于职工工资的增长，和一般集体经济中与个体经济中农民收入的增加。一切补助金和职工社会保险方面的支付，休假期间的报酬，社会安全方面所给予的年金，住休养所和疗养院的免费证，免费的医药帮助，以及其他各种支付和优待条件都是由国家负担的--这就是社会主义制度的显赫特点。仅只在一九四九年一年中，苏联人民所得到的这些优待和付款总数超过一千一百亿卢布--差不多比一九四○年多三倍。
    还有许多别的事实和数字也可以证明人民幸福的增进。一九四九年卖给人民的粮食品比一九四八年多百分之十七，卖给人民的工业品比一九四八年多百分之二五。全国国民经济中的职工人数增加了一百八十万人。有七十二万三千名男女青年毕业于工业学校和铁路学校或结束了工厂学校的训练，而被分送到工业、建筑业或运输等部门去工作了。
    指示一九四九年人民大众物质文化生活水准不断增长的一系列的事实和数字，还可以大大地继续写下去。这种增长表现于住房、学校、医院等建筑的大量增加，以及在城市和乡村中对于福利事业的规模上；也表现于在普通学校和技术学校里的学生数量在一年之中差不多增加了二百万人，而高级学校的大学生则达一百十二万八千人的数字上；也表现于研究院的巨大扩展以及许许多多其他方面。
    苏联社会主义经济发展的总结，它在一九四九年的成就和业绩，就是这样的。独占资本主义的报章企图抹煞这些辉煌的总结，这是聪明的吗？把苏联国民经济的资料同任何一个资本主义国家（美国或英国）经济状况的资料做一个简单的对比，那末在这一个对比的本身上就给资本主义体系下了一个严酷的判决。一九四九年的对比总结，对于斯大林同志的深刻结论做了新的、显著的证实，斯大林同志的结论是：
    “破产的和脆弱的资本主义经济制度已经到了它的末日，而必须让位于另一个、更高级的、苏维埃的、社会主义的经济制度；唯一的经济制度，不害怕危机，能够克服资本主义所难于解决的困难的--那就是苏维埃的经济制度。”
    实在说来，甚至于资本主义世界内最富饶的国家--美国，在今天还能跟苏联经济的成就作比较吗？
    美国在一年之内（一九四八年十月--一九四九年十月）生产量减少了百分之二二；甚至根据白宫方面官方经济评论的资料来说，一九四九年在工业上的投资减少了百分之十五，在汽车和水上交通的投资减少了百分之二七；根据白宫经济观察家所承认的评定，工资和人民的收入，一季比一季降低。特别是农民的总收入减少了二十八亿美元，而他们的纯收益降低得还要多；人民的储蓄猛烈地减少了--在一年之中减少了三十一亿美元。
    这样看来，差不多整个经济现象所表现的就是降低、萎缩、减少、衰退等等。诚然，也有表现增长的地方。但这些增长就是失业，国家负债，军备费用，独占资本家的超额利润。甚至根据官方资料，在美国一年之中完全失业的人数增加了百分之六四。美国的国家负债增加了五十四亿美元。仅只是不加掩饰的军备竞赛和对外侵略政策的费用比一九四八年的纪录差不多增加了三十亿美元。跟着垄断集团利润的增长而来的是大众的贫穷化，他们之中的绝大部分是生产战争和灭绝人类的工具。大公司的利润增加了百分之三五--五○。
    在英国、法国和其他资本主义国家，经济凋蔽的图景并不下于此，而这些国家中大多数人民大众的贫穷还要更加严重。下述两点就使人得到关于这些图景之灾难性的概念。
    第一、西欧资本主义各国在过去二十年中一直没有超过一九二九年的工业生产水准；而苏联在这二十年中，包括它的战争历史最艰苦的年月在内，工业生产量却增加了九倍。
    第二、在苏联一去而不复返地根绝了失业。关于一九四九年苏维埃经济发展总结的报导中，有一行很简单地报道：“在一九四九年以及其前的数年中，全国已经没有失业了。”同时，在资本主义国家中，完全失业和半失业的人数却超过了四千万人。四千万失业和半失业者！这是四千万男女老幼贫穷饥饿的悲剧。
    这就是资产阶级世界的今天，这一个世界正在新的残酷的经济危机中挣扎，它不是任何计划和资本主义医师的处方所能削弱和防止的。它的明天还可以预见到更多的灾难。因为资本主义是没有未来的。在全世界上，未来，光明的未来，是属于社会主义的，现在属于苏联和在列宁——斯大林旗帜之下兴起的欧亚人民民主国家。最近一世纪历史的科学分析不可避免地得出这样一个结论。这个结论也提示了经济发展上两条路线——社会主义世界和资本主义世界的对比分析。
