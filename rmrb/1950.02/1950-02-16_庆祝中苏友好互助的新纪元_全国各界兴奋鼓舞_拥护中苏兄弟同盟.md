Celebrating the New Era of Sino-Soviet Friendship and Mutual Assistance
    People from All Walks of Life Across the Country are Excited and Encouraged, Supporting the Sino-Soviet Brotherly Alliance
    The signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance, as well as the agreements on the Chinese Changchun Railway, Lushun, Dalian, and loans, is not only the first major event in Chinese history in nearly a hundred years, but also a top-priority event in the world history of this century.
    This epoch-making treaty and agreement have shaken the entire world. The people of China and the Soviet Union, as well as the vast people of the world who are striving for lasting peace and people's democracy, are cheering for this and wholeheartedly supporting it. On the other hand, the remnants of the Chiang Kai-shek bandits and the imperialist-led aggressive groups and war-mongers must have paled in fear and been unable to conceal their inner fear upon hearing this thunderbolt. This is because this treaty and agreement not only consolidated and strengthened the world peace and democracy camp headed by the Soviet Union, but also fully demonstrated the close cooperation between the two great nations of China and the Soviet Union in the great cause of striving for lasting world peace and people's democracy. It fully shows that the two great nations of China and the Soviet Union are united and resolutely will not allow Japan and any aggressive forces colluding with Japan to carry out conspiracies that endanger China and the Soviet Union. This treaty and agreement guarantees that the young People's Republic of China will have a great ally to fight alongside us in the event of aggression. The mutual assistance of 700 million people, working together for the same lofty ideal, will be a force that is unprecedented in human history. Undoubtedly, this will push human history into a new stage, and this will make international war-mongers dare not act rashly.
    When we celebrate the signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance and the two agreements, we must not forget the correct leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, and we must not forget the great fraternal friendship of Marshal Stalin and the Soviet people towards the Chinese people. We must shout: Long live Marshal Stalin, long live Chairman Mao, long live the eternal and unswerving friendship between the two great nations of China and the Soviet Union!
