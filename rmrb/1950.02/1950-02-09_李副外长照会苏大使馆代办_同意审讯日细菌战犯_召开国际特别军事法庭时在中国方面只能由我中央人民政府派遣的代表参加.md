　　The full text of the note is as follows:
　　Mr. Chargé d'Affaires:
　　I have the honor to inform you that I have received the note from the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics to the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China on February 1st. On behalf of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China, I hereby solemnly declare that I fully agree with the Soviet government's proposal to appoint an International Special Military Tribunal in the near future, in accordance with Article 5, Section A of the Far Eastern Commission resolution (FEC00713), dated April 3, 1946, to try the five Japanese bacteriological warfare criminals who have committed heinous crimes and harmed mankind, namely, Japanese Emperor Hirohito, Lieutenant General and Medical Officer Shiro Ishii, Lieutenant General and Medical Officer Masazo Kitano, Major General and Veterinary Officer Jiro Wakamatsu, and Chief of Staff of the Kwantung Army Yukio Kasahara. The Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China believes that when this International Special Military Tribunal is convened, only representatives dispatched by the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China can participate on the Chinese side, and no personnel from the Chiang Kai-shek reactionary clique, which has long lost its qualification to represent China, can participate again.
　　The Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China believes that the trial of Japanese bacteriological warfare criminals by the Soviet Military Tribunal of the Primorsky Krai from December 25th to 29th, 1949, fully demonstrated that the Soviet Union gave due punishment to the Japanese war criminals who harmed mankind and fulfilled a great responsibility for protecting the interests of mankind and the cause of peace. The justice and merit of the Soviet government have been praised and supported by all peace-loving countries and peoples in the world. In particular, the Chinese people, who have suffered from the bacteriological poisoning of imperialist Japan, have deepened their indignation towards the fascist enemy and their gratitude towards the great Soviet ally. The just call and proposal put forward by the Soviet government in the note to appoint an International Special Military Tribunal to try the five major bacteriological warfare criminals headed by Japanese Emperor Hirohito in the near future will be warmly supported by all peace-loving countries and peoples in the world. Only the imperialist governments that are intent on supporting the resurgence of Japanese imperialism and actively preparing for a new world war will reject this just call and proposal from the Soviet government and will continue to protect the heinous and top war criminal who poisoned mankind, Japanese Emperor Hirohito.
　　Please accept, Mr. Chargé d'Affaires, the expression of my highest consideration.
　　To Mr. Shibaev, Chargé d'Affaires of the Soviet Embassy in China
　　Li Kenong, February 8, 1950, Beijing

　　李副外长照会苏大使馆代办
    同意审讯日细菌战犯
    召开国际特别军事法庭时在中国方面只能由我中央人民政府派遣的代表参加
    身受日寇毒害的中国人民
    感激苏联对日战犯的审判
    伯力审判对保卫人类利益及和平的事业尽了伟大的责任
    【新华社北京八日电】中华人民共和国中央人民政府外交部李克农副部长二月八日以照会一件，送交苏联驻中国大使馆代办史白夫先生。
    照会全文如下：代办先生：
    我荣幸地通知您，已收到了二月一日苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟致中华人民共和国中央人民政府的照会。兹特代表中华人民共和国中央人民政府郑重申明：完全同意苏联政府提出的关于根据一九四六年四月三日远东委员会决议（ＦＥＣ○○七一三号文件）之第五条第Ａ款，于最近期内委任国际特别军事法庭，来审讯罪大恶极损害人类的日本五大细菌战犯，即日本天皇裕仁、石井四郎中将医官、北野政藏中将医官、若松次郎少将兽医官、笠原行雄关东军参谋长等五人的提议。中华人民共和国中央人民政府认为在召开这一国际军事特别法庭时，在中国方面，只能由中华人民共和国中央人民政府派遣的代表参加，决不能再由早已丧失代表中国资格的蒋介石反动集团的人员参加。
    中华人民共和国中央人民政府认为一九四九年十二月二十五日至二十九日苏联在伯力滨海军区军事法庭对日本细菌战犯的审判，充分地表现了苏联对损害人类的日本战犯给了应得的惩罚，对保卫人类利益及和平的事业尽了伟大的责任。苏联政府的正义和功绩，已得到了全世界一切爱好和平的国家与人民的赞扬和拥护，尤其对于身受帝国主义日本的细菌毒杀的中国人民，更增深了对于法西斯敌人的愤慨及对于伟大苏联友邦的感激。苏联政府在照会中所提出在最近期内委任国际特别军事法庭，审判以日本天皇裕仁为首的五大细菌战犯的这个正义的号召和提议，将得到全世界一切爱好和平的国家与人民更热烈的拥护，只有那存心扶植日本帝国主义再起，并积极准备新的世界战争的帝国主义政府才会拒绝苏联政府这一正义的号召和提议，才会继续包庇罪大恶极毒杀人类的头等战犯日本天皇裕仁。
    顺向贵代办先生致以崇高之敬意。
    此照苏联驻华大使馆代办史白夫先生
      李克农  一九五○年二月八日北京
