　　Li Lisan's Speech
    Calling on the Working Class to Strive for Production and Become the Mainstay of the People's Government
    When Li Lisan, Vice Chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, delivered his speech, in addition to wishing the conference a successful conclusion on behalf of the ACFTU, he explained that after liberation, the working class became the masters of the country, and the position of workers in production also changed. In state-owned and public factories and enterprises, workers have transformed from slaves dominated by machines into producers and laborers who utilize machines. The wealth created by labor belongs to all the people and ourselves. Since the working class has become the masters, it must assume its responsibilities with the attitude of masters, strive to restore and develop production, and gradually make China an industrialized, highly cultured, independent, prosperous, and strong country. To achieve this goal, a large amount of capital must be invested in production. However, the country is currently facing financial difficulties, and the fundamental way to overcome these difficulties is for the people of the whole country to tighten their belts, endure temporary hardships, work hard, and create national wealth. In this regard, the working class should play an exemplary and leading role, recognizing that only by developing production can the lives of workers be improved. He pointed out that the main tasks of the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions after its establishment are to continue to restore and develop production, support the front lines, liberate Taiwan, Tibet, and Hainan Island; unite people from all walks of life to resolutely implement government decrees, and serve as the main pillar of the government. In addition, it is also necessary to protect the daily interests of workers, organize workers' welfare undertakings based on the principle of unity and mutual assistance, and do everything possible to improve workers' political, cultural, and technical levels, and cultivate and deliver cadres for political, economic, cultural, and other organs. In the future, the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions should unite the working class of the city, give play to the wisdom and creativity of hundreds of thousands of people, and strive to build the people's capital under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party.

　　李立三致词
    号召工人阶级努力生产做人民政府的主要支柱
    全国总工会副主席李立三致词时，除代表全总预祝大会胜利成功外，并说明，在解放后，工人阶级作了国家的主人翁，工人在生产中的地位也改变了。在国营公营工厂企业中，工人已经从被机器支配的奴隶地位，变成运用机器的生产者和劳动者。劳动所创造的财富，归全体人民和我们自己享受。工人阶级既然当了主人，就要以主人翁的态度，负起责任，努力恢复和发展生产，逐渐使中国成为一个工业化的、有高度文化的、独立富强的国家。要想达到这个目的，必需有大量的资金投入生产。但目前国家财政困难，而克服这一困难的根本办法就是全国人民节衣缩食，忍受暂时的痛苦，努力劳动，创造国家财富。在这方面，工人阶级应该起模范作用和带头作用，认清只有发展生产，工人的生活才有可能获得改善。他指出：市总工会成立后的主要任务，就是要继续恢复与发展生产，支援前线，解放台湾、西藏和海南岛；团结各界人民坚决执行政府法令，作政府的主要支柱。此外还要保障工人日常利益，根据团结互助原则，举办工人福利事业，尽一切可能提高工人政治、文化、技术水平，为政权、经济、文化等机关培养和输送干部。今后市总工会应团结全市工人阶级，发挥几十万人的智慧和创造性，在中国共产党的领导下，为建设人民的首都而奋斗。
