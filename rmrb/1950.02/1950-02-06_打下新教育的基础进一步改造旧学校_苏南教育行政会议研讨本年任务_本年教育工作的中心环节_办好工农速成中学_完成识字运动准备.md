　　【Our Newspaper News】Southern Jiangsu News: The Education Department of the Southern Jiangsu Administrative Office convened an education administrative conference from the 17th to the 23rd of last month. At the meeting, the achievements of the National Education Work Conference were first conveyed; the heads of education departments and bureaus of each special district and city reported on the general situation in their respective regions; then, in accordance with the spirit of the National Education Work Conference, past work was reviewed and this year's work plan was discussed. Regarding the tasks of education work in the entire region in 1950, the conference believed that: the main aspect should be to develop new education and lay the foundation; at the same time, further and gradually transform old schools. The conference believed that to do the above two aspects of work well, three key links must be grasped: (1) The central link is to run worker-peasant accelerated secondary schools well and complete the preparations for the 1951 literacy campaign. (2) Better strengthen political and ideological education in all schools, and universally establish the idea of serving the people. (3) Vigorously build a basic school for cultivating and transforming cultural and educational cadres to meet current and future needs. In order to universally mobilize all teachers and students in the region, under a unified policy and plan, strengthen unity, give full play to initiative and creativity, and work together to complete the above tasks, the conference requested the Southern Jiangsu Administrative Office Political Affairs Conference to approve the convening of a representative conference of all Southern Jiangsu educators from February 22nd during the winter vacation; the Southern Jiangsu Student Federation also simultaneously convened an enlarged executive committee in order to unify steps and coordinate efforts.
　　The education administrative conference also discussed this year's winter school work. According to preliminary statistics, more than 2,200 winter school teachers have been mobilized and trained throughout the region, and more than 1,000 rural clubs and literacy classes have been established. The conference believed that this is an important link in creating a foundation and accumulating experience for the 1951 literacy campaign, and decided to call on all regions to conduct in-depth inspections, actively help, and pay attention to preventing the occurrence of coercion, extravagance, and apportioning in the winter school movement.
　　At present, the lives of rural (especially disaster areas) teachers are relatively difficult. The conference also attached great importance to this, and under the principle of not increasing national expenditure, suggested that governments at all levels should care about the lives of teachers and improve the shortcomings of past educational funding; at the same time, the central government's financial revenue and expenditure policies should also be repeatedly explained to teachers, so that everyone understands that today's national austerity is precisely for the sake of living a better life a little sooner tomorrow; at the same time, governments at all levels should, according to the methods of loving schools and helping students, and based on the specific local conditions, help schools to get through the ideological barriers of students' parents and smoothly solve the tuition problem.

　　打下新教育的基础进一步改造旧学校
    苏南教育行政会议研讨本年任务
    本年教育工作的中心环节
    办好工农速成中学  完成识字运动准备
    【本报讯】苏南消息：苏南行政公署教育处于上月十七日至二十三日召开了教育行政会议。会上首先传达了全国教育工作会议的成就；各专区与各市教育处、局长分别汇报了各地一般情况；继即根据全国教育工作会议精神，检查了过去工作，讨论了今年工作方针。对于一九五○年全区教育工作的任务，会议认为：主要方面应是开展新教育打下基础；同时进一步逐渐改造旧学校。会议认为要做好上述两方面工作，必须抓住三个环节：（一）中心环节是办好工农速成中学和完成一九五一年识字运动的准备工作。（二）更好地加强各校政治思想教育，普遍树立为人民服务思想。（三）用大力建设一个培养与改造文化教育干部的基础学校，以适应目前及将来的需要。为了普遍动员全区教师学生，在统一的方针计划下，加强团结，发挥积极性与创造性，共同努力完成上述任务，会议提请苏南行署政务会议通过于二月二十二日起利用寒假召开全苏南教育工作者代表会议；苏南学联亦于同时召开扩大的执行委员会，以便统一步调，配合一致。
    教育行政会议并对今年的冬学工作作了讨论。据初步统计，全区已动员训练冬学师资二千二百多人，创办农村俱乐部及识字班一千多所。会议认为这是为一九五一年识字运动创造基础、累积经验的一个重要环节决定，号召各地深入检查，积极帮助，并应注意防止冬学运动中发生强迫、铺张、摊派等现象。
    目前农村（特别是灾区）教师生活比较艰苦，会议也极为重视，在不增加国家开支的原则下，建议各级政府都要关心教师生活，改进过去发教育经费的缺点；同时也要把中央财政收支政策向教师们反复说明，使大家了解今天举国上下刻苦自励正是为了明天快一点过好日子；同时各级政府均应根据爱校助学办法，根据当地具体情况，帮助学校打通学生家长思想，顺利解决学费问题。
