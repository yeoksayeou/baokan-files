　　On the Transfer of the China Changchun Railway
　　Hu Hua
    In the new Sino-Soviet "Agreement on the China Changchun Railway, Lushunkou, and Dalian," it is stipulated that after the conclusion of a peace treaty with Japan, but no later than 1952, all rights and all property of the China Changchun Railway, originally jointly managed by China and the Soviet Union, will be unconditionally transferred to our government.
    What is the "China Changchun Railway"?
    "China Changchun Railway" is the name for the combined main railway lines in Northeast China, abbreviated as "Zhongchang Railway."
    These two main railway lines, one originally called the "Chinese Eastern Railway," runs across the northwest corner of Northeast China to the eastern border (from Manzhouli to Suifenhe). The other was originally called the "South Manchuria Railway," running southwest from Harbin, the midpoint of the Chinese Eastern Railway, directly to Dalian and Lushun.
    How was this railway built? What is its brief history?
    A Brief History of the Zhongchang Railway
    The Zhongchang Railway was originally built by Russia. In 1889, Li Hongzhang, a traitorous official of the Qing Dynasty, signed the "Sino-Russian Secret Treaty" with Tsarist Russia, in which Li Hongzhang sold the right to build the Zhongchang Railway to Tsarist Russia. Tsarist Russia, using the blood and sweat of the Russian and Chinese working people, spent several years building this railway, which was then called the "China Qing Railway," later renamed the "Chinese Eastern Railway" and the "South Manchuria Branch Line of the Chinese Eastern Railway." It was used to exploit the people and supply the Tsar and the Russian ruling class for their squandering.
    This preemptive aggressive interest of Tsarist Russia in Northeast China made Japanese imperialism extremely envious. In the Russo-Japanese War of 1904, Tsarist Russia was defeated. Japanese imperialism seized the South Manchuria Branch Line of the Chinese Eastern Railway (from Changchun to Dalian) from Tsarist Russia in the Treaty of Portsmouth.
    After the victory of the Russian Revolution in 1917, the Soviet government automatically declared the abolition of all unequal treaties of Tsarist Russia against China and other small and weak nations, and renounced all privileges of Tsarist Russia in China. Because the then Chinese Northern Warlord government ignored this, it was not until 1924, under the pressure of the people, that the Northern Warlord government signed the "Outline Agreement on the Settlement of Outstanding Issues between China and Russia" with Karakhan, the Soviet representative to China. In this agreement, the Soviet Union promised that China could redeem the Chinese Eastern Railway; before redemption, both parties agreed to temporarily manage it equally and jointly (it was originally solely owned by Russia).
    From then on, the Chinese Eastern Railway was no longer an imperialist tool for aggression and exploitation, but an enterprise operated by the Soviet working people in China that benefited the Chinese people. When the road was built, the Russian working people paid a great deal of blood and sweat. After the working people came to power in Russia, all Russian assets on the road should be redeemed with Chinese capital, and before redemption, it should be managed jointly on an equal footing, which is very reasonable.
    In May 1929, Chiang Kai-shek's reactionary government, in order to please the imperialists, tried to use the Chinese Eastern Railway as collateral for loans from the imperialists, and fantastically instigated the Northeast Army to forcibly seize the Chinese Eastern Railway and wage war against the Soviet Union, resulting in the "Chinese Eastern Railway Incident." As a result, the provocative army was defeated by the Soviet Union, and the conspiracy failed.
    After the "September 18th Incident" in 1931, the Japanese invaders attempted to seize the entire Chinese Eastern Railway. The Soviet Union was very indignant at that time and increased its troops in the Far East for defense. However, the Japanese invaders had great ambitions and would not give up without getting the Chinese Eastern Railway. Fearing the strength of the Soviet Union, they used the name of "buying" to seize the Chinese Eastern Railway in disguise at a very low price in 1935. In order to continue to strengthen its anti-fascist strength and avoid causing war, the Soviet Union had to temporarily cede the Chinese Eastern Railway. Some people said that the Soviet Union at that time "voluntarily sold the Chinese Eastern Railway to the Japanese invaders." This understanding is not in line with the facts and is misled by the malicious slander of the reactionary Nanjing government of the Kuomintang at that time.
    The Significance of the Sino-Soviet Joint Management Agreement on the Zhongchang Railway in 1945
    On August 9, 1945, the Soviet Union sent troops to Northeast China and decisively defeated Japanese imperialism. The Soviet Union took the Zhongchang Railway back from the hands of Japanese imperialism and handed it over to the Chinese people in its entirety.
    In order to facilitate the joint opposition and prevention of the resurgence of Japanese aggression forces by China and the Soviet Union; in order to facilitate the Soviet Union's use of the Zhongchang Railway to transport troops to the Lushun naval port from its own territory in the event of a war caused by Japanese aggression; and in order to strengthen the economic ties between China and the Soviet Union, the Sino-Soviet "Agreement on the China Changchun Railway" concluded on August 14, 1945, stipulated that the railway would be jointly managed by the two countries under the principle of maintaining Chinese sovereignty within thirty years, and both countries would enjoy absolute equal rights.
    Obviously, the Zhongchang Railway has significant military value in the Sino-Soviet war against Japan, and in defending against the conspiracies of Japanese invaders and other imperialist aggressive forces colluding with them to provoke new wars. In the circumstances at that time, specific provisions in this regard were very necessary.
    And in peacetime, this railway is a purely commercial transportation business jointly managed by China and the Soviet Union; this is also of great significance for helping China and the Soviet Union in economic mutual benefit and assistance. Therefore, this agreement is indeed beneficial and harmless to the Chinese people; this can also be proved by the construction of the Zhongchang Railway itself in the four and a half years since the signing of this agreement. Let us quote two reports from people who personally visited and inspected there:
    "The people themselves have only had the right to manage the railways in Northeast China for a short period of four years, and the achievements are brilliant, far exceeding the era of the puppet Manchukuo rule. ... Indeed, in the past four years, under the leadership of the Party and with the enthusiastic help of Soviet comrades, the Northeast Railway has absorbed the Soviet railway construction experience and implemented a scientific management system. ... Now, the Northeast Railway is a demonstration zone for Chinese railways, standing at the forefront of railways..." (Zhu Yixin of China Jiaotong University: Internship Notes in Northeast China for Three Months - The Soviet Union is the Most Loyal Friend of the Chinese People. Published in the "People's Daily" on November 16, 1949)
    "Liu Yan, manager of Shanghai Jianhua Jianyun Company, said: 100% of the land transportation and water transportation in Northeast China are under the unified leadership of the Northeast Railway Bureau, the Highway Bureau, and the Shipping Bureau, directly under the Northeast People's Government, and also accept the unified leadership of the ministries of the Central People's Government. This is an ironclad fact." (Today's Northeast - Facts Witnessed by Members of the Shanghai Business Community's Former Northeast Visiting Group in Northeast China. Published in the "People's Daily" on February 6, 1950)
    The New Agreement on the Transfer of the Zhongchang Railway
    Since the agreement made in 1945 was beneficial to the Chinese people, why should it be re-established this time?
    We know that the Sino-Soviet "Agreement on the China Changchun Railway" of August 1945, the Soviet Union had to sign with the Kuomintang reactionary government. The Kuomintang reactionary government went back on its word and tried every means to obstruct and sabotage this agreement, and spread rumors to confuse the public, using all kinds of despicable and shameless means. Now, the Chinese people have won, and the reactionary Kuomintang government has been overthrown. The People's Republic of China has been established, and sincere and seamless cooperation between China and the Soviet Union has become possible. This new situation provides the possibility of re-handling the issues of the Zhongchang Railway and Lushun and Dalian. Moreover, the 1945 agreement was still signed during the war against Japan, and now Japan has also been defeated. In short, "the situation in the Far East has undergone fundamental changes since 1945," so it is entirely possible to make solutions to the problems of the Zhongchang Railway, Lushun and Dalian that are suitable for the current situation.
    Article 1 of the new Sino-Soviet "Agreement on the China Changchun Railway, Lushunkou, and Dalian" stipulates:
    "The contracting parties agree that the Soviet government shall unconditionally transfer to the government of the People's Republic of China all rights to jointly manage the China Changchun Railway and all property belonging to the railway. This transfer shall be realized immediately after the conclusion of a peace treaty with Japan, but no later than the end of 1952."
    We know that the Zhongchang Railway was liberated from the Japanese invaders by the Soviet Red Army with their flesh and blood. The damage to the railway and all the losses of the railway in the war by the Japanese invaders and puppet troops were also repaired and constructed by the Soviet Union alone. Now, these properties and rights will be completely and unconditionally transferred to us, and the transfer time will not exceed three years at the latest. This is really a chivalrous aid from the Soviet Union to us, fully understanding our post-war financial difficulties. For example, in the announcement of the foreign ministers of China and the Soviet Union that we saw this time: the property acquired by the Soviet economic organs in Northeast China from the Japanese and all the real estate of the so-called barracks of the Soviet Union in Beijing in the past shall be unconditionally handed over to our country. Such great and selfless friendship, in addition to the true brotherly friendship between socialist countries and new democratic countries, is unprecedented in the world.
    Article 1 of the new agreement also stipulates: "Before the transfer, the current situation of joint Sino-Soviet management of the China Changchun Railway shall remain unchanged. However, the positions held by the representatives of China and the Soviet Union (such as the director of the railway bureau and the chairman of the board of directors) shall be changed to a periodic rotation system after this agreement comes into effect."
    Originally, in fact, when China and the Soviet Union jointly managed the railway, the Soviet personnel were much stronger than us in terms of management experience, knowledge, and methods, but they all respected our spirit of complete equality and rotated with us to take charge of management on a regular basis. This kind of true equality is only possible between brotherly countries and countries led by the Communist Party. This spirit of equality can absolutely not be found in the attitude of any foreign capitalist country towards China in the past hundred years.

　　关于移交中国长春铁路
　　胡华
    在新的中苏《关于中国长春铁路、旅顺口及大连的协定》中，规定在对日和约缔结后但不迟于一九五二年，将原由中苏共管的中国长春铁路的一切权利和全部财产无偿地移交我国政府。
    什么是“中国长春铁路”呢？
    “中国长春铁路”是中国东北的两条主要铁路干线联合起来的名称，简称“中长路”。
    这两条主要铁路干线，一条原叫“中东铁路”，横贯东北的西北角到东部边界（从满洲里到绥芬河）。一条原叫“南满铁路”，从中东铁路中点的哈尔滨，向西南直达大连和旅顺。
    这条铁路是怎样建筑起来的呢？它的简史如何呢？
    中长路简史
    中长路原是俄国建筑起来的。一八八九年中国清朝卖国贼李鸿章和帝俄签订了个《中俄密约》，在这个密约中李鸿章把建筑中长路的权利出卖给了帝俄。帝俄以俄国劳苦人民与中国劳苦人民的血汗，花了几年时间筑成了这条铁路，当时叫“中清铁路”后来又叫“中东铁路”及“中东铁路南满支线”。利用它来向人民吸血，供给沙皇与俄国统治阶级挥霍。
    帝俄在中国东北的这个捷足先登的侵略权益，使日本帝国主义十分眼红。一九○四年日俄两国帝国主义战争中帝俄失败。日本帝国主义在《朴资茅斯和约》中，就把中东铁路南满支线（从长春到大连一段）从帝俄手中夺去。
    一九一七年俄国革命胜利后，苏联政府自动地宣言废除帝俄对中国及其他弱小民族侵略的一切不平等条约，放弃帝俄在华的一切特权。由于当时的中国北洋军阀政府不理睬，直到一九二四年，在人民的压力下北洋军阀政府才和苏联来华的代表加拉罕签订《中俄解决悬案大纲协定》。在这个协定中，苏联允诺中国可赎回中东铁路；未赎回前，双方协议暂时由两国平等地共同管理（原是俄国单独所有的）。
    从此中东铁路已不是帝国主义侵略吸血的工具，而是苏联劳动人民在中国经营的有利于中国人民的一种企业了。该路建筑时，俄国劳动人民是付出了很多血汗的，在劳动人民在俄国当政后，该路一切俄国资财，应该用中国资本去赎回，未赎回前平等共管，这是很合理的事。
    到了一九二九年的五月，蒋介石反动政府为了讨好帝国主义，想拿中东铁路作为向帝国主义借款的抵押品，居然异想天开唆使东北军强夺中东路，向苏联开战，发生“中东路事件”。结果，挑衅军被苏联击溃，阴谋失败。
    一九三一年“九一八事变”后，日寇企图强夺整个中东铁路，苏联在当时是很愤慨的，并增兵远东以作防御。但日寇野心很大，不得中东路决不甘心，因惧于苏联的实力，乃用“收买”名义以很低的代价，于一九三五年变相夺去了中东路。苏联为了继续充实反法西斯实力，避免引起战争，不得不暂时出让了中东路。有人说苏联当时是“自动的出卖中东路给日寇”，这种认识是不合事实的，是受了当时国民党南京反动政府的恶意侮蔑的蒙蔽。
    一九四五年中苏共管中长路协定的意义
    一九四五年八月九日，苏联出兵东北，决定性地击溃了日本帝国主义。苏联把中长路从日本帝国主义手里夺了回来，全部交给了中国人民。
    为了便于中苏两国共同反对和防止日本侵略势力的再起；为了便于万一遭受日本侵略而发生战争时，苏联可以从国境内利用中长铁路运输军队到达旅顺军港；为了加强中苏两国的经济联系，在一九四五年八月十四日缔结的中苏《关于中国长春铁路的协定》中，规定该路在三十年内在中国保持主权的原则下由两国共同管理，两国都享有绝对平等的权利。
    显然的，中长路在中苏两国对日作战中，在防御日寇和其他与日寇勾结的帝国主义侵略势力挑动新战争阴谋中，是有重大军事价值的。在当时情况下，关于这方面的具体规定是很必要的。
    而在平时，这条铁路完全是中苏两国所共管的纯粹商业性质的运输事业；这对于帮助中苏两国在经济上的互惠互助有无相通，也是有很大意义的。所以这个协定对中国人民说来，确实是有利而无害的；这一点我们还可以拿从这个协定签订后的四年半来中长路本身的建设情况来做证明，让我们引用两段亲自到那里去参观、考察的人士的报导：
    “人民自己真正有权管理东北的铁路，仅有短短的四年历史，成绩辉煌，远超过伪满统治时代。……的确，四年来，东北铁路在党的领导和苏联同志的热心帮助下，吸取了苏联铁路建设经验，推行了科学的管理制度，……现在，东北铁路是中国铁路的示范区，站在铁路的最前列……”（中国交通大学祝怿新：东北三月实习随记——苏联是中国人民最忠实的朋友。载一九四九年十一月十六日《人民日报》）
    “上海建华建运公司经理刘炎说：全东北的陆路运输和水上交通，百分之百都掌握在东北铁路总局、公路总局和航运总局的统一领导下，直辖于东北人民政府，并且接受中央人民政府各部统一领导，这是铁一般的事实。”（今日的东北——上海工商界前东北参观团团员在东北目睹的事实。载一九五○年二月六日《人民日报》）
    关于移交中长路的新协定
    既然一九四五年订的协定对中国人民是有利的，这次为什么要从新订立呢？
    我们知道，一九四五年八月的中苏《关于中国长春铁路的协定》，苏联曾不得不是和国民党反动政府订立的。国民党反动政府出尔反尔，曾经百般阻挠、破坏这个协定，并造谣惑众，使尽卑污无耻之手段。现在好了，中国人民胜利了，反动的国民党政府已被推翻。中华人民共和国建立了，中苏真诚无间的合作有了可能，这种新的情况，就提供了重新处理中长路、旅大诸问题的可能性。而且，一九四五年的协定还是在对日战争时期订的，现在日本也已被打败了，总之“自一九四五年以来远东的形势起了根本的变化”，所以完全可以对中长路，旅大诸问题作适合现时情况的解决。
    在中苏新的《关于中国长春铁路、旅顺口及大连的协定》第一条规定：
    “缔约国双方同意苏联政府将共同管理中国长春铁路的一切权利以及属于该路的全部财产无偿地移交中华人民共和国政府。此项移交一俟对日和约缔结后立即实现，但不迟于一九五二年末。”
    我们知道，中长铁路是苏联红军以血肉从日寇手中解放出来的，战争中日寇伪军对该路的破坏、该路的一切损耗，也是由苏联一力修补建设起来的；现在这些财产、权利都将完全无偿的移交我们，而且移交时间至迟不超过三年，这实在是苏联对我们的侠义式的援助，完全体谅了我们战后的财政困难。又比如，这次我们看到的中苏两国外长宣布：苏联经济机关在东北由日本人手中所取得的财产和苏联过去在北京的所谓兵营的全部房产，无偿地交与我国。像这样的伟大无私的友谊，除了社会主义国家对新民主国家的真正兄弟手足般的情谊之外，在世界上是史无先例的。
    新协定第一条中又规定：“在移交前，中苏共同管理中国长春铁路的现况不变。惟中苏双方代表所担任的职务（如铁路局长、理事会主席等职），自本协定生效后改为按期轮换制”。
    本来，事实上，在中苏共管该路时，苏方人员无论在管理的经验上、知识上、办法上都比我们强得多，但他们都以完全平等的尊重我们的精神，与我们按期轮换负责管理，这种真正的平等，也只有兄弟之邦、共产党领导的国家之间才有。这种平等精神，在中国近百年任何外国资本主义国家对中国的态度中是绝对找不到的。
