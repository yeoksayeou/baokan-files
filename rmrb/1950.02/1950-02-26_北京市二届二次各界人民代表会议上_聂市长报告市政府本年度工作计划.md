[Beijing News] Mayor Nie Rongzhen's report on the Beijing Municipal People's Government's work plan for 1950 at the Second Session of the Second Beijing Municipal People's Representative Conference is as follows:

Comrades Representatives:

Today, on behalf of the Beijing Municipal People's Government, I am reporting to the conference on the work plan for 1950, and I request the conference's discussion and corrections.

1949 was a year of great change, both for the country as a whole and for Beijing. In this year, we made great efforts to destroy the remaining reactionary forces, establish and consolidate the revolutionary order, restore and develop the production of public and private industries and agriculture, and develop the people's cultural and educational undertakings, and we achieved considerable success. In terms of municipal construction, although limited by manpower and financial resources, it was impossible to achieve much, but some necessary work was done. Our work plan for 1950 is based on the work and achievements of 1949, and it was formulated with a relatively accurate estimate of the financial strength and all objective conditions for 1950. Now, I will elaborate as follows:

(1) Continue to Consolidate the Revolutionary Order

Our central task for 1950 remains the restoration and development of production. However, in order to restore and develop production, we must continue to consolidate the revolutionary order. Therefore, we must first do a good job in the construction of political power and judicial and public security work. Facts have proven that the Municipal People's Representative Conference is the best organizational form for the people to manage municipal affairs. However, for a large city like Beijing, with a large area, a large population, and an underdeveloped and dispersed industrial and commercial economy, it is necessary to establish District People's Representative Conferences in addition to the Municipal People's Representative Conference. We plan to select two districts for pilot projects and, after gaining experience, promote this throughout the city. At the same time, the organizational structure of each district must be slightly expanded under the principle of striving for simplification, otherwise it will not be able to meet the needs of the work. Because there are many things that should be handled with the assistance of the districts, such as primary school education, and in order for the districts to assist in handling these matters, their organizational structure must be expanded. We have already made this preparation.

This is in regard to the urban areas. In the suburbs, we are continuing to carry out land reform. Work has been completed in 200 of the 260 administrative villages (excluding Guanxiang), and it is estimated that all will be completed before the spring plowing. After the land reform is completed, we will further and universally carry out democratic political construction.

In terms of judicial work, the experience of the past year has proven that it is inconvenient for the people to concentrate all civil and criminal cases in the Municipal People's Court for handling. Therefore, we are considering establishing several District People's Courts based on the existing District Mediation Sections as primary trial organs to hear general civil and criminal cases.

In terms of public security work, in order to maintain the security of the capital and guarantee production and construction, we are determined to strictly guard against the hidden and infiltrated Chiang Kai-shek bandit secret agents, international spies, and saboteurs, strengthen the security work of organs, factories, and schools, and conduct labor reform on the reactionary elements who have been convicted and the scattered enemy and puppet officers and soldiers, hooligans, beggars, and petty thieves who have been successively rounded up.

(2) Vigorously Restore and Develop Production

Vigorously restoring and developing production is our overriding central task for 1950. In order to achieve this task, we are prepared to carry out the following work:

(1) In terms of state-owned enterprises, in addition to reorganizing and expanding existing factories and mines such as the Jingxi Coal Mine, Qinghe Woolen Mill, Yanjing Paper Mill, New Flour Mill, and New Glass Factory, we also plan to add several new factories such as a woolen textile factory, a carpet factory, a flour mill, and a dyeing and ironing factory based on needs and conditions such as manpower, financial resources, technology, raw materials, and sales. Some are expanding existing factories or merging with existing factories. In addition, the tap water company, which belongs to public utilities, plans to increase the water-using population by 360,000 to 400,000 people, which requires expanding the water distribution main pipe by 10,500 meters, the water distribution branch pipe by 17,355 meters, replacing the small water pipes by 23,787 meters, a total of 51,642 meters, and setting up a clear water pool with a capacity of 6,000 cubic tons; the tram company will strive to have an average of 90 to 97 trams running daily throughout the year; and the bus company plans to have 40 buses running daily before May and 100 buses running daily after May.

In order to develop the production of state-owned enterprises, we must improve planning, strictly implement economic accounting, accelerate capital turnover, and strive for appropriate profits to accumulate capital; further implement the ideas of democratic management and rational operation, and pay attention to the welfare of workers; and actively carry out production competitions and new record movements to improve quality, increase output, and reduce costs. Collective contracts must also be signed in state-owned enterprises.

(2) In terms of private enterprises, in addition to further improving the majority of industries that have already been restored and developed, we will also focus on using more resources to support industries that are necessary for the development of production and people's lives, so that they can improve and expand equipment, improve quality, reduce costs, increase output, and expand sales. We should strengthen guidance and support for special handicrafts in order to increase export goods and exchange for necessary import goods.

Based on the current foundation of private enterprises and the preliminary production plans of several major industries this year, we strive to achieve the following in 1950: (A) Increase some larger factories. There are currently 86 factories with more than 30 employees in this city. We strive to increase by 100 to 150 factories through expansion, new construction, etc. (B) The number of employees will increase by another one-fifth, or about 6,000 people. (C) Electrical machinery and equipment will increase by 10% to 20%. (D) The average output of various industries will increase by another one time. (E) The total value of special handicrafts output will strive to increase by one time compared with 1949.

In order to develop the production of private enterprises, we must strengthen guidance on the business direction of private enterprises and overcome some of the blindness in private production; at the same time, we must continue to adjust labor-management relations that still need to be adjusted and sign labor-management collective contracts, truly achieving mutual benefit for both labor and management, in order to stimulate the production enthusiasm of both labor and management.

(3) In terms of agricultural production, in addition to closely integrating the current land reform with production, so as not to delay production due to land reform, we will also launch a large-scale production movement after land reform, develop farmers' mutual aid organizations, reward deep plowing and careful cultivation, make full use of urban manure and garbage, and call on each mu of land to apply 30 jin more fertilizer. We will plan to carry out water conservancy projects, dredge rivers and canals, dig 80 electric wells, dig 200 ordinary small wells, loan out 640 water carts (water conservancy facilities will be assisted by loans from the Central Ministry of Agriculture), and organize sideline and handicraft production. It is estimated that in the absence of major natural disasters, agricultural production alone can increase by 14.5% compared to the normal year's output.

(4) In addition to public and private enterprises and agricultural production, we will also plan to develop organ production to improve the lives of organ cadres, school staff, and students.

In order to restore and develop production, trade companies, banks, and cooperatives must resolutely implement the policy of serving production, supporting production, stabilizing prices, ensuring the supply of daily necessities for citizens, and striving to promote the exchange of materials between urban and rural areas and at home and abroad. The work in this regard in 1949 was successful. In 1950, we still need to make further efforts. In addition to implementing correct trade and price policies and appropriately supplying citizens with necessities such as grain, coal, and cloth, trade companies will also continuously improve and expand the business of retail stores. In addition to consolidating existing consumer cooperatives and production cooperatives, cooperatives will also steadily develop. The specific plan is to develop a consumer network, consolidate and reorganize existing consumer cooperatives, and strive to have most of the 311,800 urban working people who have not yet organized join the cooperatives; develop production cooperatives, based on industry, starting with supply and marketing, develop specialized production cooperative federations, that is, production and sales cooperatives for handicraft production, so that they gradually move towards unified leadership, unified procurement, unified processing, unified specifications, and unified promotion; in addition, universally develop rural supply and marketing groups, and focus on establishing rural supply and marketing cooperatives. Bank work will adopt all methods to absorb public and private deposits, expand savings and remittance business, and in a planned and focused manner, handle industrial loans, agricultural loans, and commercial loans that are conducive to urban and rural trade and import and export. The preliminary loan targets and proportions are: 36.5% for state-owned production, 19.8% for private production, 15.2% for agricultural production, 16.8% for public and private commerce, 1.5% for handicraft production, and 10.2% for cooperatives.

(3) Appropriately Develop Cultural, Educational, and Health Undertakings that Serve the Working People

In 1950, our cultural, educational, and health work will adopt the policy of serving production and serving the working people. The specific plan is:

(1) In terms of education, we will develop social education, vocational education, and normal education to improve the culture of the working people, train a large number of worker-peasant intellectuals and technical talents needed for production and construction, and for general primary and secondary schools, in addition to appropriately increasing schools and classes in areas where the working people live, we will generally focus on improving quality first, and not seek quantitative development. First, in terms of primary schools, there are about 100,000 out-of-school children in this city. In order to gradually give them the opportunity to attend school, in 1950, municipal primary schools decided to add at least 55 classes, an increase of 2.7% compared to the original 2,463 classes. Among them, 44 classes will be added in urban areas where there are more workers' children and out-of-school children, and 15 classes will be added in large administrative villages in the suburbs that do not yet have primary schools. In addition, the problem of the remaining out-of-school children will be solved by subsidizing private primary schools and reorganizing children's literacy classes. Second, in terms of secondary schools, there are currently 191 classes in municipal secondary schools in this city. In 1950, it is planned to find ways to add another 40 classes, an increase of more than one-fifth. Among them, it is planned to add a municipal secondary school in the outer city where the working people live and there is no municipal secondary school. Municipal secondary schools cannot be increased in large numbers this year. It is planned to first support and improve private secondary schools, and those who have done a good job and have genuine economic difficulties will be rewarded and subsidized. Third, in terms of vocational education and normal education, there are only two municipal vocational schools, namely, the Senior Technical School and the Senior Commercial School, with a total of 845 students. In 1950, it is planned to add 17 classes, with 850 students, an increase of about one time. It is also planned to set up technical classes in the original municipal secondary schools. And cooperate with relevant departments to run short-term technical training classes or rotational training classes. There were originally two municipal normal schools in this city, with a total of 18 classes and 900 students. In 1950, it is planned to add 5 classes, with 250 students. At the same time, it is also planned to run short-term normal training classes. Fourth, in terms of social education, first of all, according to the resolution of the previous Municipal People's Representative Conference, we will prepare to run a spare-time remedial school for 30,000 people, mainly industrial workers and on-the-job cadres, and under the leadership of the Central Ministry of Education, we plan to pilot a new type of worker-peasant accelerated school (funded by the Ministry of Education) to train worker-peasant intellectuals. In addition, in the urban areas, we should reorganize and improve the original 773 adult remedial classes, and in the suburbs, we should strive to establish regular adult remedial schools in at least one-quarter of the villages. Secondly, we will add three civil education centers in the fourth, tenth, and eleventh districts. In addition, we will add 34 newspaper and reading rooms in each district. And in a planned and step-by-step manner, eliminate illiteracy. We will first select a district in the urban area and several villages in the suburban area as experimental areas, and after gaining experience, we will formulate a work plan for eliminating illiteracy in a certain number of years.

(2) In terms of literary and art work, we will coordinate with production tasks, widely carry out literary and art popularization work, and on the premise of popularization, we will focus on carrying out literary and art improvement work, give timely promotion and guidance to the popular literary and art movement, strengthen the leadership of the mass creation research association, run mass creation training classes, strengthen the leadership of opera reform work, improve the factory literary and art work committee, cooperate with the Federation of Trade Unions to establish a Beijing Labor People's Club, establish a supplementary school for literary and art workers and the Beijing People's Art Theater, and establish a touring performance system for factories, rural areas, and schools to closely link literary and art work with the masses.

(3) In terms of health work, we will adhere to the principle of prevention first, while taking into account medical treatment, gradually establish a health and medical work network on the original basis, carry out factory hygiene, maternal and child health, and health education, prevent the spread of infectious diseases, and provide free or reduced-fee medical treatment for the working people. According to the statistics of 1949, there are only 17 hospitals in Beijing, with about 1,600 beds, that is, an average of about 1.2 beds per thousand citizens. Adding the suburban citizens, the average is about 0.8 beds per thousand people, and the distribution of these hospitals is extremely uneven. Some areas where the working people live do not have a single hospital. Therefore, in 1950, first of all, we should add medical institutions in these areas. However, limited by manpower and financial resources, it is not yet possible to establish large hospitals. It is planned to first add four workers' clinics in the outer city districts where the working people are concentrated, add mobile medical teams in the suburbs, and continue to subsidize the four workers' clinics and four suburban farmers' medical cooperation agencies that have been established in other districts to facilitate medical treatment for workers and farmers. In addition, we will instruct and help major factories establish medical institutions. Secondly, in addition to the existing maternal and child health care center, we will add one each in the inner and outer cities, not only to do general maternal and child health work, but also to provide free examinations and delivery for poor working women. Thirdly, there were originally seven health affairs offices in this city, four in the city and three in the suburbs, specializing in epidemic prevention and health work. It is planned to add two, one in the four districts of the city and one in Fengtai. Fourthly, infectious disease hospitals play a great role in prevention. There is currently one in this city, with only 50 beds, and it is located in the city. It is planned to build a new one in Ditian in the northern suburbs, with 70 beds. Fifthly, we will enrich the original Municipal Fourth Hospital and restore the mental hospital. At the same time, we plan to further improve the other municipal hospitals in terms of equipment, system, and medical treatment. Sixthly, we will adopt the methods of entrusting, cooperating, or designating other public and private health and medical institutions to universally provide free or reduced-fee outpatient services for poor working people and patients with acute illnesses, and the government will appropriately subsidize medical expenses to supplement the lack of strength of municipal medical institutions. Finally, we will carry out epidemic prevention work according to the season and different objects, and the total number of people scheduled to be vaccinated or injected with cowpox, typhoid, diphtheria, typhus, rabies, pertussis, epidemic encephalitis, and other vaccines is more than 2 million.

(4) Focus on Carrying Out Necessary Municipal Construction Work

The municipal construction work in 1950, like the cultural, educational, and health work, will adopt the policy of serving production and serving the working people. The specific work will focus on transportation engineering and sanitation engineering.

In transportation engineering, the main thing is road engineering. There are a total of 3,117 streets and alleys in Beijing, and only 156 are asphalt roads or asphalt macadam concrete roads. Adding other various paved road surfaces, there are only 309. The rest are dirt roads. Generally speaking, the traffic situation is bad. In particular, there are very few good roads in areas where the working people live. In order to improve this situation, we plan to build ten kinds of high-grade road surfaces in accordance with the principles of connecting industrial centers, opening up important trunk lines, facilitating public transportation, and meeting the needs of the majority of citizens, namely, the Jingmen Highway, the Jianguomen to Eastern Suburb Industrial Area Highway, Andingmen Street, Beixinqiao to Gulou Street, Ministry of Justice Street, Jiuxingbu Street to Wolfo Temple Street, Chongwai Street, North-South Gouyan, East-West Biaobei Hutong, and Guangqumen to Suanshikou. The total length is 26.59 kilometers, and the total area is 216,272 square meters. At the same time, we will improve 17 dirt road lines in important hutongs, with a total length of 16.83 kilometers and an area of more than 103,000 square meters. In addition, we will selectively renovate, repair, and maintain old roads, bridges, and culverts.

In sanitation engineering, the first is the sewer project. The total length of the existing sewers in Beijing is 314 kilometers, and most of them are silted up and collapsed, losing their drainage function. Especially in areas where the working people live, there are very few or even no sewers. Therefore, dredging and repairing sewers and solving the drainage problems in areas where the working people live have become the main tasks before us. We have decided to: (1) Dredge and repair the sewers of the North-South Gouyan, Chongwenmen, Chaoyangmen, Andingmen, North Xinhua Street, Qipan Street, and Dashiqiao systems and convert the Longxugou into a covered ditch. A total of 100,114 meters of ditches will be dredged, 68,600 tons of mud will be removed, 21,309 meters of ditch body will be repaired or rebuilt, 3,207 meters of ditches will be renovated, and 2,320 exploration wells and 4,640 rainwater outlets will be added. (2) Try to solve the water accumulation problems in the East-West North Chenggen, Paozihe, Tianqiao and other places, and add open ditches or pipe ditches. Mobilize citizens to connect and repair branch ditches, and strive for 1,500 households, including organs, factories, schools, shops, and some residences, to add and repair branch ditches and connect to public ditches.

Secondly, it is the river project. Like the sewers, the rivers in Beijing have been in disrepair for years and are mostly silted up, and the water source of Yuquan Mountain is not enough to supply the needs of the rivers, lakes, and seas in the urban area, so it is necessary to develop water sources, dredge rivers, and repair sluices. We have decided to: (1) Dredge the Yuquan Mountain spring pool and drill ten mechanical wells to solve the water source problem. (2) Dredge the Jinhe River, Changhe River, West Moat, South Moat, and the front three gates of the Moat, and dredge the three seas (the project costs for developing the Yuquan Mountain water source and dredging the three seas will be funded by the Central Government). (3) Build and improve the Kunming Lake inlet, the West Moat gate, the Xizhimen Bridge gate, and the Qinglongqiao gate to control water consumption.

Thirdly, it is other environmental sanitation improvement projects. We have decided to: (1) Add 100 public toilets for men and women on the streets and set up 15 manure and sewage disposal sites in the suburbs. (2) Add 400 public sewage pools and 200 seepage wells, and use the method of public-private partnership to mobilize citizens to build several other sewage pools and seepage wells. (3) Reorganize the cleaning team, increase transportation tools, improve work efficiency, and pilot the method of residents sweeping by sections, and strive to no longer accumulate garbage, and use garbage to fill the ponds and depressions in the outer city.

(5) Take Planned Measures to Relieve Unemployment and Other Related Social Welfare Measures

There is still a considerable number of unemployed people in Beijing, and because production is still in the process of reorganization, some factories still need to streamline redundant personnel, and the streamlined and transferred workers must also be properly resolved. In particular, with the development of trams and buses, some of the tricycle workers must change careers. How to solve these problems has been put on our agenda. In addition to implementing the resolutions of the previous People's Representative Conference on relieving the unemployment of employees, we have also decided to take the following measures: (1) In a planned manner, disperse the population with labor to the Northeast and Chahar-Suiyuan and other places to engage in industrial and agricultural production. (2) Use the method of work-for-relief to absorb part of the unemployed population to participate in transportation engineering and sanitation engineering. (3) The 1,268 prostitutes who were taken in after the implementation of the resolution of the previous People's Representative Conference on closing brothels, after three months of training, except for those who have returned to their hometowns and have been matched, will be organized to participate in production. Regarding other social welfare issues, the most important is to gradually implement the labor insurance system, inspect the safety equipment of factories and mines, and urge them to improve.

Comrade Representatives: The above is the main content of our work plan for 1950. In addition, there are many other tasks, such as land surveying, real estate registration, housing management, and financial and tax consolidation, which cannot be listed one by one. The formulation of this plan has undergone a long period of brewing, many discussions, and repeated revisions. On the one hand, this is because our experience in managing the city is still very insufficient, and on the other hand, it is also because we cannot but be serious and responsible and prudent in our work. I hope that everyone will criticize and correct this plan without reservation and examine it. Once the conference passes it, we will make every effort to strive for its realization.

　　北京市二届二次各界人民代表会议上
    聂市长报告市政府本年度工作计划
    【北京讯】聂荣臻市长在北京市第二届第二次各界人民代表会议上关于北京市人民政府一九五○年度工作计划的报告，全文如下：各位代表：
    今天，我代表北京市人民政府，向大会报告一九五○年度的工作计划，请大会讨论和指正。
    一九四九年，不论就全国说，不论就北京市说，都是伟大变化的一年。在这一年中，我们在摧毁残余的反动势力，建立和巩固革命秩序，恢复和发展公私营工业和农业的生产，以及发展人民的文化教育事业上，曾经作了很大的努力，也曾获得不小的成绩。在市政建设方面，虽为人力财力所限制，不可能多所建树，但也做了一些必要的工作。我们的一九五○年度工作计划就是以一九四九年的工作及其成绩为基础，并比较精确地估计了一九五○年度的财政力量和一切客观条件而拟订的。现在，分述如下：
    （一）继续巩固革命秩序
    我们一九五○年的中心工作，仍是恢复和发展生产。但为了恢复和发展生产，必须继续巩固革命秩序。因此，首先要做好政权建设和司法、公安工作。事实证明：市各界人民代表会议是人民管理市政的最好的组织形式。但像北京这样地区广，人口多，工商业经济不发达又很分散的大城市，除了市各界人民代表会议之外，还有建立区各界人民代表会议的必要。我们拟即选择两个区试办，取得经验后，即推行全市各区。同时，各区组织机构在力求精简原则下，还必须稍事扩大，否则不能适应工作需要。因为有许多事应该由区协助办理，如小学教育等，而要区协助办理，就必须扩大其组织机构。我们现在已作这一准备。
    这是就城区而言。在郊区，我们正在继续进行土地改革，在全部二百六十个行政村（不包括关厢）中，已有二百个行政村完成工作，估计在春耕前，可全部完成。土地改革完成后，即进一步普遍开展民主建政工作。
    在司法工作方面，一年来的经验证明，一切民刑案件都集中到市人民法院处理，对于人民是不方便的。因此，我们考虑以原有的各区调解科为基础，建立若干区人民法院，作为初审机关，受理一般民刑案件。
    在公安工作方面，为了维护首都治安，保证生产建设，我们决对暗藏和潜入的蒋匪特务，国际间谍，破坏分子，严密防范，对机关、工厂、学校的保卫工作，予以加强，对已判罪的反动分子和陆续收容的流散敌伪官兵、流氓、乞丐、小偷等分别进行劳动改造。
    （二）大力恢复和发展生产
    大力恢复和发展生产，是我们一九五○年度，压倒一切的中心任务。为了实现这一任务，我们准备进行以下的工作：
    （１）在公营企业方面，除将现有各厂矿如京西煤矿、清河制呢厂、燕京造纸厂、新建面粉厂、新建玻璃厂等加以整顿扩充外，并根据需要和人力、财力、技术、原料、销路等条件，拟增设纺毛厂、地毯厂、面粉厂、染烫厂等几个新厂，有的，是就原有工厂扩大或和原有工厂合并。此外，属于公用事业的自来水公司拟增加用水人口三十六万到四十万人，因而需要扩充配水管干管一万零五百公尺，配水支管一万七千三百五十五公尺，撤换小水管二万三千七百八十七公尺，共计五万一千六百四十二公尺，并设一座可容六、○○○立方公吨的清水池；电车公司争取全年平均，每日出车九十至九十七辆；公共汽车公司计划在五月以前，每日出车四十辆，五月以后，每日出车一百辆。
    为了发展公营企业的生产，必须提高计划性，严格实行经济核算，加速资金周转，争取适当利润以累积资金；进一步贯彻民主管理和合理经营的思想，并注意工人的福利事业；积极开展生产竞赛和新纪录运动，以提高质量、增加产量、减低成本。公营企业中也必须订立集体合同。
    （２）在私营企业方面，除对大部分已经恢复和发展了的行业，从现有的基础上，更提高一步外，并有重点地用较多的力量去扶植在发展生产和人民生活上所必需的行业，使其改进和扩充设备、提高质量、减低成本、增加产量、扩大销路。对于特种手工艺，当加强指导和扶植，以争取增加出口货物，换取必要的进口货物。
    根据目前私营企业的基础和今年几个主要行业的初步生产计划，一九五○年度，争取做到：（甲）增加一些较大的工厂。本市现有三十人以上的工厂八十六户。争取经过扩充、新建等方式，再增加一百户到一百五十户。（乙）职工人数再增加五分之一，即六千人左右。（丙）电力机器设备增加百分之十到百分之二十。（丁）各行业产量平均再增加一倍。（戊）特种手工艺产量总值争取较一九四九年度增加一倍。
    为了发展私营企业的生产，必须加强对私营企业营业方向的指导，克服私营生产方面的一些盲目性；同时，也必须继续调整尚须调整的劳资关系和订立劳资集体合同，真正做到劳资两利，以刺激劳资双方的生产积极性。
    （３）在农业生产方面，除把目前正在进行着的土地改革和生产密切结合起来，不致因进行土地改革而耽误生产外，并在土地改革后，开展大生产运动，发展农民生产互助组织，奖励深耕细作，充分利用城市粪便垃圾，号召每亩地多施肥三十斤。有计划地兴办水利，疏浚河渠，凿电井八十座，凿普通小井二百眼，出贷水车六百四十台（水利设施由中央农业部贷款协助）以及组织副业和手工业生产。估计在没有大的天灾的情况下，仅农业生产即可比常年产量增加百分之十四·五。
    （４）在公私营企业和农业生产外，并有计划地，发展机关生产，以改善机关干部，学校员生的生活。
    为了恢复和发展生产，贸易公司、银行、合作社必须坚决执行为生产服务的方针，扶植生产，稳定物价，保证市民生活必需品的供应，致力城乡、内外物资的交流。在这方面，一九四九年度的工作是有成绩的。一九五○年度，仍须进一步努力。贸易公司除执行正确的贸易和价格政策和适当供给市民粮、煤、布匹等必需品外，并不断改进和扩大零售店的业务。合作社除巩固现有的消费社和生产社外，并稳步地加以发展。具体计划是：发展消费网，巩固和整理现有消费社，争取还没有组织起来的城市劳动人民三十一万一千八百余人大部入社；发展生产合作社，以行业为基础，从供销作起，发展专业生产合作社联合社，即手工业生产的产销合作社，使其逐渐走向统一领导，统一采购，统一加工，统一规格，统一推销；此外，并普遍发展农村供销小组，有重点地建立农村供销社。银行工作则将采用一切办法吸收公私存款，扩大储蓄，汇兑业务，有计划，有重点地，办理工贷、农贷及有利于城乡贸易和出入口的商业贷款。贷款对象和比例初步拟定：公营生产百分之三十六·五，私营生产百分之十九·八，农业生产百分之十五·二，公私商业百分之十六·八，手工业生产百分之一·五，合作社百分之十·二。（⑴⑷）
    （三）适当发展为劳动人民服务的文教卫生事业
    一九五○年度，我们的文教卫生工作，采取为生产服务，为劳动人民服务的方针。具体计划是：
    （１）教育工作方面是在发展社会教育，职业教育和师范教育，以提高劳动人民的文化，大量培养工农知识分子和生产建设所需要的技术人才，一般中小学则除在劳动人民聚居的区域酌量增校增班外，一般暂先主要求在质上改进，不求量的发展。第一、就小学说，本市现有失学儿童约十万人。为了逐步给予他们以就学的机会，一九五○年度，市立小学决定至少增设五十五班，较原有的二千四百六十三班增加百分之二·七。其中，城区是在工人子弟和失学儿童较多的区域增加四十四班，郊区是在现在还没有小学的大行政村增设十五班。此外，则用补助私立小学和整顿儿童识字班的方法来解决其余失学儿童的求学问题。第二、就中学说，本市现有市立中学一百九十一班，一九五○年度，拟设法再增加四十班，即增班五分之一强。其中，拟在劳动人民聚居而没有市立中学的外城，增设市立中学一所。市立中学还不可能大量增校增班，今年拟先对私立中学扶植改进，凡办理有成绩而经济确有困难者则予以奖励和补助。第三、就职业教育和师范教育说，本市市立职业学校仅有高工和高商二校，共有学生八百四十五人。一九五○年度拟增加十七班，学生八百五十人，约增一倍。另拟在原市立中学中设技术班。并协同有关部门办短期技术训练班或轮训班。本市市立师范学校原有二所，共十八班，学生九百人，一九五○年度拟增加五班，学生二百五十人。同时，并拟办短期师范讲习班。第四、就社会教育说，首先，是根据上次本市各界人民代表会议的决议，筹办以产业工人和在职干部为主的三万人的业余补习学校，并拟在中央教育部领导下，试办一所新型工农速成学校（经费由教育部拨），以培养工农知识分子，此外，在城区，当整理和改进原有的七百七十三班成人补习班，在郊区则争取至少在四分之一的村庄成立经常性的成人补习学校。其次是在第四、第十、第十一等区增设民教馆三处。另在各区增设书报阅览室三十四处。并有计划，有步骤地，消灭文盲，城区先选一个区，郊区先选若干村，作为实验区，在取得经验后，再制定于若干年内消灭文盲的工作计划。
    （２）文艺工作方面，是在配合生产任务，广泛地开展文艺普及工作，在普及为主的前提下，有重点地，进行文艺的提高工作，及时给普及的文艺运动以推动和指导，加强对大众创作研究会的领导，开办大众创作讲习班，加强戏曲改革工作的领导，健全工厂文艺工作委员会，配合总工会建立北京市劳动人民的俱乐部，创办文艺工作者的补习学校和北京人民艺术剧院，建立工厂农村学校巡回表演制度，使文艺工作密切联系群众。
    （３）在卫生工作方面，是本预防为主，同时照顾到医疗的方针，在原有基础上，逐步建立卫生医疗工作网，开展工厂卫生，妇婴卫生和卫生教育，防止传染病流行，免费或减费为劳动人民医疗。根据一九四九年的材料统计，北京市只有医院十七所，病床约一千六百张，即市民每一千人平均占有病床约一点二张，加上郊区市民则每千人平均约零点八张，并且这些医院分布极不平衡，有些劳动人民聚居的区域，竟没有一所。因此，一九五○年度，首先，应在这些区域增设医疗机构。但限于人力财力，设立大的医院尚不可能。拟先在劳动人民集中的外城各区增设工人诊疗所四处，在郊区增设巡回医疗队，并继续资助其他各区已设的四个工人诊疗所和四个郊区农民医药合作社，以便利工农医疗。此外，并责成和帮助各大工厂设立医疗机构。其次，在现有的一处妇婴保健所外，另在内外城各增设一处，不仅做一般妇婴卫生工作，并对穷苦劳动妇女免费检查接生。第三、本市原有卫生事务所七处，城内四处，郊区三处，专作防疫卫生工作。拟增设二处，一设城内四区，一设丰台。第四、传染病院在预防上有极大作用。本市现有一处，仅五十张病床，且设在城内。拟在北郊地坛新设一处，备病床七十张。第五、充实原有的市立第四医院，恢复精神病院，同时，对其他市立医院，则在设备、制度、医疗等各方面，都拟加以进一步改善。第六、采取委托、合作或指定的方式，使其他公私立卫生医疗机关普遍对穷苦劳动人民、急病患者，实行免费或减费门诊，由政府酌予补助医药费，以补市立医疗机构力量的不足。最后，按照季节和不同对象，进行防疫工作，预定接种或注射牛痘、伤寒、白喉、斑疹伤寒、狂犬、百日咳、流行性大脑炎等疫苗的总人数为二百余万人。
    （四）有重点地进行必要的市政建设工作
    一九五○年度的市政建设工作，也和文教卫生工作一样，采取为生产服务，为劳动人民服务的方针。具体工作是以交通工程和卫生工程为主。
    在交通工程中，主要是道路工程。北京市共有三千一百一十七条街道和胡同，而沥青路或沥青石碴混凝路仅有一百五十六条。加上其他各种已铺装的路面，也不过三百零九条。此外，都是土路。一般地说，交通情况是恶劣的。特别是劳动人民聚居的地区很少好路。为了改善这一情况，我们计划在连结产业中心，打通重要干线，便利公共交通，适应多数市民需要的原则下，修筑各种高级路面十条，即京门公路、建国门到东郊工业区公路、安定门大街、北新桥到鼓楼大街、司法部街、旧刑部街到卧佛寺街、崇外大街、南北沟沿、东西裱褙胡同以及广渠门到蒜市口。总长二六·五九公里，总面积二十一万六千二百七十二平方公尺。同时，改善重要胡同土路十七线，共长一六·八三公里，面积十万三千余平方公尺。另对旧路和桥梁涵洞则择要翻修，补筑和保养。
    在卫生工程中，首先是下水道工程。北京市现有下水道总长三百一十四公里，且大部淤塞坍塌，失掉排水作用，特别是在劳动人民聚居的地区，下水道极少，甚至没有。因此，掏挖和整修下水道以及解决劳动人民聚居地区的排水问题，便成为摆在我们面前的主要任务。我们决定：（１）掏挖和整修南北沟沿、崇文门、朝阳门、安定门、北新华街、棋盘街、大石桥等系统的下水道并改建龙须沟为暗沟。共计掏挖沟道十万零一千零十四公尺，除泥六万八千六百公吨，修补或改建沟身二万一千三百零九公尺，翻修沟道三千二百零七公尺，添建探井二千三百二十座和雨水口四千六百四十座。（２）尽量解决东西北城根、泡子河、天桥等地的积水问题，添建明沟或管沟。发动市民接修支沟，争取一千五百户包括机关、工厂、学校、商店及部分住宅添修支沟，接通公沟。
    其次，是河道工程。北京市的河道和下水道一样，年久失修，多已淤塞，而玉泉山水源也不够供给市区河道湖海的需要量，故必须开发水源，疏浚河道，修理水闸。我们决定：（１）疏浚玉泉山泉池，并凿机井十眼以解决水源问题。（２）疏浚金河、长河、西护城河、南护城河前三门护城河等河道，并疏浚三海（开发玉泉山水源和疏浚三海等工程费，由中央拨款）。（３）修建和改善昆明湖入水口，西护城河闸，西直门桥闸，青龙桥闸等，以节制水量消耗。
    第三、是其他改善环境卫生工程。我们决定：（１）增建市街男女公共厕所一百座，并在郊外设粪污处置场十五座。（２）增设公共秽水池四百座和渗水井二百座，并用民办公助方式，发动市民另建秽水池及渗水井若干座。（３）整理清洁总队，增加运输工具，提高工作效率，并试行居民分段扫除办法，争取不再积存垃圾，并利用垃圾填平外城的水塘洼地。
    （五）有计划地采取救济失业及其他有关社会福利的措施
    北京市现在还存在着相当数量的失业人口，并且因为生产还在改组过程中，有些工厂的冗员尚须精简，而被精简和转业的职工也须适当解决，特别是随着电车和公共汽车的发展，三轮车工人有一部分必须转业。怎样解决这些问题，已列入了我们的日程。我们除已执行上次各界人民代表会议关于救济失业员工问题的决议外，并决定采取以下的措施：（１）有计划地，疏散有劳动力的人口，到东北和察绥等地，从事工农业生产。（２）用以工代赈的办法，吸收一部分失业人口参加交通工程和卫生工程。（３）执行上次各界人民代表会议关于封闭妓院的决议所收容的一千二百六十八名妓女，经过三个月训练、除回籍和择配者外，将组织其参加生产。关于其他社会福利问题，最主要的是拟逐渐实施劳动保险制度，检查厂矿的安全设备并督促其改进。
    各位代表：以上就是我们一九五○年度工作计划的主要内容。此外，还有许多工作，如土地测量、房地产登记、房屋管理以及整理财政税收等，不暇一一列举。我们拟订这个计划，曾经过长期酝酿，多次讨论，一再修改。这一方面，是由于我们管理城市的经验还很不够，另一方面，也由于我们对工作不能不严肃负责和慎重将事。我希望大家对这个计划，不客气地，批评指正，加以审查。一俟大会通过后，我们就要尽一切努力为它的实现而奋斗。（附图片）
