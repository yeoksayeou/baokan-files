Looking at This Year's Prices from Last Year's Price Increases
    Sun Zhizhong
    In the past few days, the prices of several foods, such as vegetables, meat, and grain, have begun to rise slightly. This is the first time since 1950. As a result, people who have long suffered under the high price pressures of the reactionary rule are once again feeling apprehensive about this issue. In fact, our current socio-economic situation is not only fundamentally different from that during the reactionary rule, but also differs from last year's conditions in several respects. Our prices will not only never follow the path of malignant inflation as they did during the reactionary rule; moreover, due to the improvement of certain conditions, they will definitely have a considerable degree of stability from this year onwards. That is to say, prices in 1950 will definitely be more stable than in 1949.
    There were three price increases in 1949. One in April, one in July, and one in November. Each of these started in one or two regions and then spread to other places. Taking Beijing as an example, when it was first liberated, millet was 14 yuan per catty, and by the end of the year it had risen to 800 or 900 yuan per catty, about 60 times. The increase in other grains and fuels related to millet was similar throughout the year. Other examples include "non-staple foods rising 53 times, and cotton cloth rising 43 times." These were concentrated in the above-mentioned three very short periods, with leaping increases, and the rest of the time was relatively stable. The reasons for last year's price surges were mainly due to the rapid development of the national military victory situation. Not only were the war expenses very large, but the lives of a large number of uprising and surrendered troops, and old public and teaching staff had to be maintained. Industries, mines, transportation and other undertakings that had been destroyed by the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, and some private enterprises, were immediately invested in to be restored. Thus, it was inevitable that a certain degree of currency inflation would be caused, forming a trend of price increases.
    Coupled with the speculation of some unscrupulous merchants, adding fuel to the fire, the price increases were further exacerbated. However, due to the administrative power adopted by our People's Government, such as supervising the market and certain economic measures, prices began to gradually stabilize from November 25th.
    To summarize the reasons for the three price surges in 1949, it was nothing more than the inflation of currency to a certain extent and the lack of materials under special circumstances. And these two are inseparable from the various conditions in our society. These conditions have gradually improved this year, as described below:
    1. Military situation
    1949 was a year of great military victory for us. In this year, we achieved unparalleled brilliant victories on the Chinese mainland. We had several major campaigns, all involving the concentration of millions of troops. Although there are still tasks to be carried out to liberate Taiwan, Tibet, and Hainan Island, generally speaking, the enemy is already like a candle in the wind, and the scale of operations this year will not be as long and large as last year. Military expenditures may also be reduced.
    What is even more optimistic is that since Chairman Mao issued the call for "the army to participate in production" last year, troops in the North China, East China, and Central South China military regions that do not have war service tasks have been engaged in production. Each military region also stipulated production tasks and requirements in the instructions. The Henan Military Region turns in 80 catties of wheat per person, the Hubei Military Region stipulates that each person should produce 300 catties of rice, and Jiangxi requires each person to guarantee an income of 300 catties of grain throughout the year, and 150 catties for government employees. In addition, there have been concrete achievements in the sideline production of troops in Changsha and other places. Furthermore, reports of troops in various places engaging in production with gains and achievements are constantly seen in the newspapers. Based on the glorious achievements of the People's Liberation Army in Nanniwan, Yan'an in the past, we firmly believe that the great power of this batch of production troops this year will definitely be of great help to the national economy.
    2. Political situation
    Last year, our army achieved major victories, but in many newly liberated areas, social order could not be stabilized for a while, and the credit of the Renminbi could not be fully established. The situation this year, however, is very different. Since the establishment of the Central People's Government last October, the heartfelt support it has received from all walks of life can be said to be the first time in our history. Now, except for Tibet, the entire mainland has been completely liberated, and the area led by our government is unprecedentedly large. Under this situation, the people across the country have more confidence in the Renminbi than last year. This condition is of considerable help to the stability of prices. Due to the stability of political order, our government has the power to monitor and crack down on some unscrupulous merchants who hoard and speculate. More importantly, our financial and economic staff have gained important experience from last year's price increases and have many new measures for future market management. For example, when prices fluctuated in Beijing last November, the municipal government took measures to strengthen retail sales, setting up retail stores for grain, coal, and cloth to directly supply citizens. By the end of November, 149 grain retail stores had been established. In terms of coal and cloth supply, 150 coal briquette processing and retail stores and six cotton cloth consignment stores have also been established. These measures will also play a considerable role in stabilizing prices.
    3. International situation
    Since the establishment of our Central People's Government, the Soviet Union was the first to establish diplomatic relations with us. Subsequently, the new democratic countries in Eastern Europe also took the same action. Our country's international status has been unprecedentedly improved in the peace and democratic camp led by the Soviet Union. Therefore, import and export trade will definitely increase this year. What is particularly worthy of attention - and this is the decisive factor for the improvement of all international situations - is the further development and consolidation of the friendship between China and the Soviet Union. Before October last year, our Central People's Government had not yet been established. Although the Soviet Union had provided us with assistance, such as a local trade agreement in the Northeast, it could not be considered large-scale. This year, due to Chairman Mao's visit to the Soviet Union, the Soviet Union will definitely provide significant assistance to our country's future economic construction. This will also definitely play a major role in our production and construction this year.
    4. Financial situation
    Last year, due to the ongoing Liberation War, most areas were still in the midst of war. Except for the old liberated areas, the vast rural areas could not pay public grain. And the tax collection in several larger industrial and commercial cities has not yet been carried out. Therefore, last year's expenditures were mainly maintained by issuing currency, which relatively reduced the value of the Renminbi and caused prices to rise. This year, these conditions are completely different. In the 1950 financial budget, public grain accounted for 41.4%, various taxes accounted for 38.9%, enterprise income accounted for 17.1%, warehouse clearance income accounted for 2.4%, and other income accounted for 0.2%. In the total income, the most important are public grain and taxes. According to recent reports, although North China has suffered from waterlogging and drought disasters, "this year's collection has been basically victoriously completed" and "Henan Province's autumn grain collection work has been victoriously completed." The grain collection work in other provinces such as Hubei has also been completed very smoothly. This shows that the income from public grain will not be a problem. As for the percentage of tax revenue, it is not too high compared to before the "July 7th" Incident. Our pre-war customs, consolidated, and salt taxes would exceed this percentage of tax revenue. This shows that as long as no accidents occur, the income from "taxes" will not be a big problem.
    It should be noted that the total amount of this income is only 81.3% of the total expenditure, and the remaining 18.7% is a deficit (that is, debt). There are two ways to solve this deficit: one is to rely on issuing public bonds, and the other is to rely on bank overdrafts, that is, issuing currency. That is to say, part of the deficit in this year's financial budget is filled by public bonds, which is completely different compared to last year. The enthusiasm of people in various places to purchase public bonds recently proves that we are confident in completing this task as well. However, 11.5% of the total expenditure is still maintained by issuing currency, which is a difficulty we expected; but compared with last year, it is insignificant. With the continued expansion of the circulation of the Renminbi, the increased issuance of such a small amount of currency is estimated to have little stimulus to prices.
    5. Economic situation
    The analysis in the previous section tells us that this year's deficit will be much smaller than last year's. The analysis in this section will show that although many areas suffered severe disasters last year, our supply of materials this year may still be more abundant than last year. This is due to the result of economic construction. It is also the main reason why our prices can be more stable this year than last year.
    First of all, the traffic situation this year is much better than last year. Inland river shipping has gradually recovered, and roads that have been damaged are also being restored. What is particularly important is the restoration of railway transportation lines. Since the Jinghan and Yuehan two main lines are connected, materials in the north and south can be smoothly exchanged. Therefore, prices can also be obtained relatively stable. According to the People's Daily on January 17, "Since the opening of the Yuehan Road, the southbound transportation of goods has increased daily, and the prices in Guangzhou have generally decreased. Compared with New Year's Eve last year and the 10th of this month, medium white rice has fallen by nearly 20%, 32-count Fairy Yarn has fallen by more than 10%, and Qin Liangyu white cloth has fallen by more than 11%." (Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, 16th)
    Secondly, in terms of agriculture, 1950 can be divided into two stages. The first stage is before the autumn harvest. Although there are many difficulties during this period, the supply of grain for public employees and urban residents may not be a problem due to the completion of the autumn levy work. Last year, due to water, drought, and locust plagues, severe difficulties were caused in some rural areas, but due to the effective leadership of our People's Government, most disaster areas developed sideline industries and handicrafts in the call of "production and disaster relief," and the disaster will be safely overcome soon after the summer harvest. The second stage is after the autumn harvest. According to the report of Agriculture Minister Li Shucheng, this year's grain plan is to increase production by 10 billion catties, and the cotton plan is to increase production by 4.7 million dan, an increase of about 40% compared to last year. Under the pragmatic working spirit of our people's governments at all levels, we expect that there will be no problems with these plans! In fact, we have already seen reports of efforts such as "building water conservancy," "preparing for spring plowing," and "accumulating fertilizer" in the newspapers, which shows that our production increase plan has achieved preliminary results. This achievement is only possible after the establishment of our People's Government. Therefore, as long as we do not encounter unexpected natural disasters, the increased production of grain and certain industrial raw materials after the autumn harvest this year is even more worthy of our optimism!
    Looking at the industrial production situation, it is even more worthy of our optimism! Reports of industrial production being completed and exceeding the plan are pouring in like snowflakes. Just to give a few examples, such as the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant, during the rule of the Japanese puppets and reactionaries, the highest daily output was 180 tons, but since December last year, the plant has created a daily output of 331 tons. If compared with the cost of 160 tons per day last summer, the cost per ton has been reduced by 21%, equivalent to 503 catties of millet. According to the new output, more than 166,400 catties of millet can be saved every day. Another example is the Tianjin Steel Plant, from the liberation to the end of last year, the average monthly output exceeded 4.9 times that of the Kuomintang reactionary rule period, and the cost was reduced by 44%. Moreover, all the employees of the factory also proposed to "strive to increase the steel output of our factory to 3.3 times that of 1949 in 1950" in the letter to Chairman Mao reporting production achievements. In addition, the production of industrial and mining enterprises in the Northeast has even broken through the standards of the puppet Manchukuo era. Increased production also means increased materials, and increased materials can enhance the stabilizing effect of prices. What reason do we have not to be optimistic about this year's prices? !
    Yes, we did not say that this year's prices will not rise at all. 1950 may be our last year of difficulty. That is to say, prices may still have a steady increase this year. However, due to the improvement of various conditions, the speed of price increases this year can definitely be guaranteed to be much smaller than last year. Let us excerpt a passage from Chairman Mao's instructions at the fourth meeting of the Central People's Government Committee on December 2 last year as the conclusion of this article:
    "Our situation will get better year by year. It is estimated that next year will be better than this year. Within three to five years, our economic undertakings can be fully restored; within ten to eight years, our economy can be greatly developed."

### 从去年物价上涨看今年的物价

　　从去年物价上涨看今年的物价
    孙执中
    这几天来，有好几种食品如蔬菜、肉类、粮食等的价格，都开始有些上涨。这还是一九五○年以来的第一次。于是，曾长期喘息于反动派统治时期物价高压之下的人们，便又对这个问题感到隐忧。其实，我们目前所处的社会经济情况，不仅与反动派统治时期有了本质上的不同，即与去年的各种条件相较，也有了若干的差异。我们的物价，不仅决不会如反动派统治时期一样走上恶性上涨的道路；而且，由于某些条件的好转，从今年起一定会有相当程度的稳定。这就是说，一九五○年物价一定要比一九四九年来得稳定些。
    一九四九年曾有过三次物价上涨。即四月一次，七月一次，十一月一次。这三次都是先从某一个或两个区域开始，然后波及各地。以京市而论，才解放时，小米每斤为十四元，到年底已涨到八、九百元一斤，约为六十倍左右。与小米有关的其它粮食与燃料，全年上涨的倍数也与此相仿佛。其它如“副食类上升五十三倍，纱布上升四十三倍。”这些都是集中在上述三段极短的时间里，作跳跃式的上涨，其余的时间都比较平稳。去年涨风的原因，主要由于全国军事胜利的形势迅速发展，不但作战费用开支很大，大批起义及投降部队，和旧的公教人员的生活均须维持，被蒋匪帮所破坏了的工、矿、运输等事业及某些私营企业立待投资去恢复；这样，就不得不引起某种程度上的通货膨胀而形成了物价上涨的趋势。
    加上某些奸商的投机，推波助澜，更加剧物价上涨。但由于我人民政府采取了行政力量，如监督市场与某些经济上的措施，自十一月二十五日起，物价便开始渐趋稳定。
    总结一九四九年三次涨风的原因，不外由于通货在某种程度上的膨胀与物资在特殊情况下的缺乏。而这两者是与我们社会上的各种条件分不开的。这些条件在今年都已逐渐好转，兹分述如下：
    一、军事上的情况
    一九四九年是我们军事上大胜利的一年。这一年内我们在中国大陆上获得了无比辉煌的胜利。我们曾有过几个大战役的进行，这些战役都是以数百万军队集中在一起。今后虽还有解放台湾、西藏、海南岛的任务要进行，但总的说来敌人已是风中残烛，今年作战的规模当不如去年那样长久庞大。军费上的开支也就可能减少。
    更值得我们乐观的是：毛主席自去年发出“军队参加生产”的号召之后，在华北、华东、华中南各军区没有战争勤务的部队，都已从事了生产。各军区并且在指示中均规定了生产任务及要求。河南军区每人交公八十斤麦子，湖北军区规定每人应生产三百斤大米，江西要求每人全年保证收入三百斤谷子，机关人员一五○斤。长沙等地部队的副业生产，更有了具体的成就。此外，在报纸上更不断见到各地军队从事生产有收获有成绩的报导，根据解放军过去在延安南泥湾的辉煌成就，我们深信今年这批生产军的伟大力量，一定会对国民经济有很大的帮助。
    二、政治上的情况
    去年我军获得了重大胜利，但在许多新解放区，社会秩序还一时不能安定，人民币的信用还未能完全确立。而今年的情况，则已大异。自去年十月中央人民政府成立以后，其所受到各界的衷心拥护，真可以说是我们有史以来的第一次。现在除西藏外，全国大陆已完全解放，我政府所领导的区域之广大，也是空前的。在这个形势下面，全国人民对人民币的信任已较去年为高。这个条件对于物价的稳定是有相当的帮助的。由于政治才秩序的安定，我们政府对于某些囤积居奇的奸商已有力量去监视与取缔。更重要的是：我们财经工作人员从去年的物价上涨中已获得了重要的经验，对今后市场的管理已有了许多新的措施。如京市人民政府在去年十一月物价波动时，便采取了加强零售的办法，普设粮、煤、布零售店，直接供应市民。到十一月下旬，只粮食零售店即设立了一百四十九处。在煤、布供应方面，也建立了煤球加工零售店一百五十处，纱布代售店六处。这种措施，对于物价的稳定，也是会起相当大的作用的。
    三、国际上的情况
    自从我中央人民政府成立以后，苏联就首先与我建立外交关系。接着东南欧的新民主主义国家也采取了同一的举动。我们国家在以苏联为首的和平民主的阵营之中，国际地位已空前提高。因此今年进出口贸易必会增加。特别值得重视的——这是一切国际情况中好转起着决定因素的，是中苏两国友谊的进一步的发展与巩固。在去年十月以前，我中央人民政府尚未成立，苏联虽对我有过援助，如在东北有过局部的贸易协定，但还不能算大规模的。而今年，由于毛主席的访苏，苏联对我国今后的经济建设必定会有很重大的帮助。这对我们今年的生产建设，也必定起着重大的作用。
    四、财政上的情况
    去年由于解放战争正在进行，大部区域还处在烽火之中。除老解放区外，广大的农村还不能缴纳公粮。而几个较大的工商业城市的税收也尚未进行。故去年各方面的支出，主要的是靠发行来维持，这样就相对的降低了人民币的价值而使物价上涨。今年，这些条件已完全不同。在一九五○年的财政概算内，收入项下公粮占百分之四十一·四，各项税收占百分之三十八·九，企业收入，占百分之十七·一，清理仓库收入占百分之二·四，其他收入占百分之○·二，在总收入中，最主要的是公粮与税收两种。根据近日报载：华北虽是水旱为灾，但“今年征收业已基本胜利完成”“河南省秋季征粮工作已胜利完成”。其他如湖北等省的征粮工作也都很顺利的完成了。这说明了公粮的收入，是不会成问题的。至于税收一项所占的百分比，比起“七、七”事变以前来也是不算太高的。我们战前的关、统、盐三税就会超过这个税收的百分比数。这说明了只要不发生意外，“税收”这一项的收入，也是不大成问题的。
    应该说明的是，这个收入的总额，仅及支出总额的百分之八十一·三，其余的百分之十八·七则是赤字（即亏欠）。解决这个赤字的办法是两个：一个是依靠发行公债，另一个是依靠银行透支，即发行货币。这就是说，今年财政概算中的一部分赤字是用公债来填补的，这与去年相较也是完全不同的。近日来各地购买公债的踊跃，证明我们这一项工作也是有把握完成的。但全部支出中还有百分之一一·五是靠发行来维持的，这是我们预期以内的困难；但与去年比较，则已微不足道。跟着人民币流通范围的继续扩大，增发这样一点货币，估计对物价的刺激可能是不大的。
    五、经济上的情况
    上一节的分析，告诉了我们今年的赤字要比去年小得多。这一节的分析将说明，去年许多地区虽遇严重灾荒，但我们今年的物资供应，仍可能比去年充裕。这是由于经济建设的结果。也是我们今年物价可以较去年为稳定的最主要的理由。
    首先，今年交通的情况，要比去年好得多。内河航运已逐渐恢复，公路破坏了的也在恢复中。特别重要的是铁路运输线的恢复，自京汉、粤汉两条主要干线衔接以后，南北物资已能顺畅的交流。因之物价也可能求得比较的稳定。据人民日报一月十七日所载：“自粤汉路通车后，货物南运日增，广州物价普遍下降，以本月十日与去年除夕相比较，中白米下跌百分之二十弱，三十二支天女纱下跌百分之十强，秦良玉白布下跌百分之十一强。”（新华社广州十六日电）
    其次，就农业方面说，一九五○年可以分做两个段落。第一个段落是在秋收以前，这期间困难虽然很多，但由于秋征工作的完成，对于公教人员和城市居民粮食的供应，或可不成问题。在去岁由于水、旱、蝗灾，虽曾造成某些农村中的严重困难，但由于我人民政府的得力领导，大部分灾区都在“生产救灾”的呼声中发展了副业和手工业，不久夏收以后，灾荒必可安全渡过。第二个阶段是在秋收以后，根据农业部长李书城的报告，今年粮食计划增产一百亿斤，棉花计划增产四百七十万担，较去年增产百分之四十左右。这些计划在我各级人民政府实事求是的工作精神之下，我们预期是没有问题的！事实上我们在报纸上已经看到了“兴修水利”，“准备春耕”，“积肥”等的努力报导，这说明了我们增产计划，已有了初步的成就。这个成就只有在我人民政府成立以后才有可能。因之，只要不遇到意外的天灾，今年在秋收以后的粮食与某些工业原料的增加生产，是更值得我们乐观的！
    再看工业方面生产的情况，就更值得我们乐观了！报纸上报导工业生产完成并超过计划的有如雪片飞来。随便举几个例子，如石景山钢铁厂，在日伪与反动派统治时期，每日最高产量为一八○吨，而自去年十二月起，该厂就创造了日产三三一吨的产量。如与去夏日产一六○吨的成本作比，则每吨减低了成本百分之二十一，计折小米五○三斤，按新产量计算，每日可节省十六万六千四百余斤小米。又如天津制钢厂，从解放后到去年年底，每月平均产量超过了国民党反动派统治时期的四·九倍，降低了成本的百分之四十四。而且，该厂全体职工在给毛主席报告生产成绩的信里，还提出了要“在一九五○年，争取把我厂制钢产量提高到一九四九年的三·三倍。”的保证。此外，如东北工矿的生产，有的更突破了伪满时代的标准。生产增加，也就意味着物资的增加，物资的增加就可增强物价的稳定作用。我们有什么理由对今年的物价不作乐观的看法呢！？
    是的，我们并没有说今年的物价可以完全不涨。一九五○年，可能是我们困难的最后一年。这就是说，今年的物价还可能有稳步的上涨的。不过，由于各种条件的好转，今年物价上涨的速度，一定可以保证会比去年小得多。让我们摘录一段毛主席去年十二月二日在中央人民政府委员会第四次会议上的指示来作为本文的结语：
    “我们的情况会一年比一年好起来，估计明年要比今年好。在三年五年的时间内，我们的经济事业可以完全恢复；在十年八年的时间内，我们的经济就可以得到巨大的发展。”
