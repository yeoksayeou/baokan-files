Workers in North China Continue to Purchase Government Bonds

[Our Newspaper Dispatches] In factories, government offices, and schools throughout North China, the movement to subscribe to government bonds continues to unfold. Reports are as follows:

	Changxindian

As of the end of last month, 2,532 workers and staff at the Changxindian Railway Machinery Factory had participated in purchasing government bonds, buying a total of 7,663 shares. This accounts for 72.43% of the total number of shares sold by the Changxindian office of the People's Bank during the same period. (He Hongwu)

	Beijing

Workers and staff of the Central Fuel Industry Department, in order to help the government overcome financial difficulties, are willing to economize on food and clothing, give up smoking, and forgo spending money in order to purchase government bonds. Eighty-eight workers bought 363 shares. All 219 staff members bought 2,672 shares, totaling 3,035 shares, which accounts for more than 49.2% of their total monthly salaries. The average subscription is more than 9.73 shares per person. (Personnel Section, Central Fuel Industry Department)

Also, the Central Taxation Bureau, in response to the government's call, convened a mobilization meeting for all staff of its North China Wine Monopoly Company to encourage subscriptions. The subscription movement is now actively underway.

	Jiaozuo

Under the call of the group leader conferences and the student union, all faculty and students of Jiaozuo Institute of Technology enthusiastically launched a bond purchase movement. Some professors and lecturers proposed purchasing government bonds with their entire month's salary. The professors group subscribed for more than 460 shares. The students' enthusiasm was even higher, with some even taking out their wedding rings to purchase bonds. In total, the entire school purchased more than 1,540 shares of government bonds, more than four times the original estimate of 300 shares.

	Changzhi

The Changzhi North China Taihang Transportation Company originally planned to sell 150 shares of government bonds, but due to the active subscription of the workers, 81 people purchased about 400 shares. Workers in nine factories and small factories in Changzhi City have generally set off a wave of subscription enthusiasm, and have now subscribed to more than 2,400 shares. Fourteen state-owned stores in the city have subscribed to a total of more than 7,200 shares, setting a leading example for the city's business community. The original allocated amount for the business community was 26,000 shares, and more than 22,000 shares have now been subscribed. In addition, more than 400 people in directly affiliated government units have also subscribed to 904 shares, exceeding the original task by more than 200 shares. The citizens are also unwilling to lag behind and have now subscribed to more than 3,600 shares. According to statistics, in the second half of last month, all sectors of the city had already subscribed to 29,091 shares.

	Taiyuan

All staff of the Taiyuan Ordnance Bureau Repair and Manufacturing Plant began a government bond subscription competition on the 11th of last month. Within three days, all 201 staff members subscribed to a total of 1,466 shares, an average of more than 7 shares per person. (Er Xiao)

	Liangxiang

At the end of January, the Liangxiang Mine Factory trade union convened worker's conferences to mobilize subscriptions to government bonds. The planned target was 1,500 shares, but the entire factory subscribed to 2,005 shares, exceeding the original target.

	Yangquan

Due to in-depth publicity in Pingyao, Yuci, Yangquan and other counties, the promotion of government bonds has been successful. By early February, Yangquan had gloriously exceeded its task. The county was originally allocated 36,500 shares, but the actual subscription reached 42,290 shares. Pingyao sold 13,000 shares in ten days, accounting for 56% of the total task of the Chengguan District. Yuci has completed 23,470 shares, accounting for 88% of the total task.
