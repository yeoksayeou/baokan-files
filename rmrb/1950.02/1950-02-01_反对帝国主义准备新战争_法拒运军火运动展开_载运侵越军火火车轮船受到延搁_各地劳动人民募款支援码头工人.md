Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, January 31st: According to a TASS report from Paris on the 30th, despite the French government's suppression of people supporting peace, the French working people continue to actively struggle against imperialist preparations for a new war and against the war in Vietnam. Railway employees and residents of Thiers, upon learning that a train carrying tanks intended for the Vietnam War would pass through the station on the night of the 27th, gathered at the station to block the train. Dock workers in Le Havre and Dunkirk refused to load tanks onto ships bound for Vietnam. *L'Humanité* reported that the ship "Phare" carrying munitions was delayed first in Le Havre and later in the port of Brest. On the 28th, authorities in the port of Brest imposed martial law, deploying a large number of police and so-called "Republican Security Companies" to the port, especially to the location of the "Phare," and even setting up anti-tank obstacles to prevent workers from going to the port. Later, they ordered the army to load military supplies onto the ship.

　　The dock workers' heroic struggle has received sincere support from other working people. The French working people have organized a fundraising movement to help dock workers who refuse to handle war materials. Workers at the Ivry factory have raised 50,000 francs for dock workers in Saint-Nazaire. Democratic organizations in Paris have also organized similar fundraising movements.

    【新华社北京三十一日电】据塔斯社巴黎三十日讯：尽管法国政府对拥护和平的人们进行镇压，法国劳动人民仍继续进行积极的斗争，反对帝国主义准备新战争，反对越南的战争。台尔的铁路员工与居民，在得知一列载运准备用于越南战争的坦克的火车将在二十七日夜间路经这一车站时，就聚集在车站，阻住这一列车。哈佛尔与敦刻尔克的码头工人，拒绝把坦克装上驶赴越南的船。人道报报道：装运军火号的法勒士船先在哈佛尔，后来又在巴勒士港受到延搁。二十八日，巴勒士港当局实施戒严，出动大批警察与所谓“共和国保安队”的人员到港口，特别是法勒士号所在的地点，还设置了反坦克障碍物，阻止工人到港口去，以后才下令军队把军用物资装到船上。
    码头工人的英勇斗争，得到其他劳动人民的真诚支援。法国劳动人民已组织了募捐运动，集款帮助拒绝搬运战争物资的码头工人。依佛利工厂的工人，已为圣那最尔的码头工人募集了五万法郎。巴黎民主团体也组织了同样的募款运动。
