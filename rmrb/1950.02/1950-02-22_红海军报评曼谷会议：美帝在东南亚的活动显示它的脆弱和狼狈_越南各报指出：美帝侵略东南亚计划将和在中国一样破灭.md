Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, February 21st: TASS, Moscow—A columnist for the Red Navy newspaper commented on the Bangkok conference held by US diplomats stationed in Far Eastern and Southeast Asian countries, stating: The reason why the US imperialists kept the Bangkok conference so secret is because they feared publicizing their aggressive goals and plots against the democratic forces of Asia. But a few days ago, Jessup told press representatives that the United States "would favor any regional alliance among Asian countries," which revealed the US imperialists' plan to gather aggressive blocs in the Far East.

The commentary wrote that the epoch-making victory of the Chinese people, the establishment of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, the emergence of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam on the international stage, and the high tide of the struggle for national independence in Malaya, Burma, and other colonial countries have all dealt devastating blows to the policies of British and American imperialism in Asia. However, the imperialists, defeated time and again, do not want to consider these facts. The US ruling groups continue to pursue their previous aggressive colonial policies toward the people of Asia. The US imperialists are betting on reactionary forces, supporting puppet governments in Southeast Asia, pinning their hopes on the puppet Bao Dai, and regarding Japan as a pillar of their aggressive policy in the Far East, openly supporting Japanese reactionaries and encouraging the revanchist sentiments of the Yoshida government.

The commentary concluded: The frantic activities of US imperialists in Southeast Asia clearly demonstrate their weakness and embarrassment in the face of the growing national liberation movement of the Asian people. In implementing their aggressive policy toward Asia, the US ruling groups are attempting to rely on the defeated Japanese imperialists, who are hated by the Asian people, and other reactionaries in Far Eastern and Southeast Asian countries. This attempt is doomed to inevitable failure.

According to Vietnam News Agency, North Vietnam: Newspapers in North Vietnam unanimously pointed out that the purpose of the Bangkok Conference was to expand the sphere of influence of the United States and obtain new markets for American goods in Southeast Asia. *Cuu Quoc* (Salvation) newspaper, the organ of the Viet Minh, said that the Bangkok Conference attempted to coordinate the expansionist activities of US imperialists with the activities of reactionary elements in Southeast Asia. The newspaper concluded that the lessons of China are still fresh in people's minds, and if the reactionary imperialists want to learn these lessons once again from other parts of Asia, then they will certainly receive them. *Doc Lap* (Independence) newspaper of the Vietnamese Democratic Party commented that the US imperialist plan to invade Southeast Asian countries will fail just like its failure in China. The people of Asia are determined not to allow the US imperialists to forcibly occupy their land under the guise of anti-communism.

　　红海军报评曼谷会议：美帝在东南亚的活动显示它的脆弱和狼狈
    越南各报指出：美帝侵略东南亚计划将和在中国一样破灭
    【新华社北京二十一日电】塔斯社莫斯科讯：红海军报专栏作家评论美国驻远东与东南亚各国外交官所举行的曼谷会议称：美帝国主义者对于曼谷会议保守这样大的秘密，是因为他们怕公布他们对亚洲民主力量的侵略性目标和图谋。但几天以前，耶塞普曾对报界代表说：美国“将赞成亚洲各国当中的任何区域性同盟”，这就泄露了美帝国主义者在远东纠合侵略性集团的计划。
    评论写道，中国人民的划时代胜利，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的成立，越南民主共和国在国际舞台上的出现，马来亚、缅甸及其他殖民地国家争取民族独立斗争的高涨，这一些都给予英美帝国主义者在亚洲的政策以毁灭性的打击。然而，一次又一次被击败的帝国主义者们，不想考虑这些事实。美国统治集团继续奉行以前对亚洲人民的侵略性的殖民政策。美帝国主义者把赌注押在反动力量方面，支持东南亚的傀儡政府，把希望寄托在傀儡保大身上，并把日本看作他们在远东侵略政策的支柱，公然支持日本反动派并鼓励吉田政府的复仇情绪。
    评论最后指出：美帝国主义者在东南亚的狂热活动，明显地表示了他们在日益增长的亚洲人民的民族解放运动面前的脆弱和狼狈。美国统治集团在执行他们对亚洲的侵略政策时，企图依赖为亚洲人民所痛恨的已被击败的日本帝国主义者及远东与东南亚国家的其它反动分子。这个企图，是注定要遭到必不可免的失败的。
    另据越南通讯社北越讯：北越各报一致指出，曼谷会议的目的，是在于扩充美国的势力范围和为美国商品在东南亚获取新市场。越盟机关报《救国报》说，曼谷会议力图使美国帝国主义者扩张主义活动与东南亚反动分子的活动配合。该报结语说，但中国的教训在人们的头脑中记忆犹新，如果反动的帝国主义者想再一次从亚洲的其他部分得到这些教训的话，那么，他们一定会得到的。越南民主党的独立报评论说：美帝侵略东南亚国家的计划，将和它在中国的失败一样归于破灭。亚洲人民坚决不让美帝在反共假面具下强占他们的土地。
