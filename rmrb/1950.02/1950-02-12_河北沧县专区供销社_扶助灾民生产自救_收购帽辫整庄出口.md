　　Hebei Cang County Special District Supply and Marketing Cooperative
　　Helps Disaster Victims to Help Themselves Through Production; Purchases Whole Village Batches of Braided Hat Exports
　　[Dispatch from this newspaper] The Cang County Special District Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Hebei Province, in order to rectify the braided straw hat industry in the district and help disaster victims to help themselves through production, established a key braided straw hat cooperative in Xingji Town, Cang County, to purchase in large quantities and export in whole village batches. The special district has a long-standing foundation in the braided straw hat industry, with 866 villages and more than 120,000 people in Qing County, Huanghua, Jianguo, Cang County, and Xian County having the skills to braid hats. However, because in the past, the products were mostly purchased by foreign firms at low prices, farmers who braided hats had no profit to gain from production, and most stopped production, leading to the decline of the braided straw hat industry. In order to help disaster victims to help themselves through production, the Cang County Special District Supply and Marketing Cooperative contacted state-owned export companies to expand sales channels; and established agency collection relationships with county cooperatives in various producing areas. It also uniformly set prices according to Tianjin market conditions and purchased separately. From the establishment of the Xingji Branch in June of last year to December, the branch and various hat-producing counties cooperated to uniformly purchase 197,740 catties of braided straw hats, exporting more than 120,000 catties, and exchanging them for more than 960,000 catties of miscellaneous grains, more than 3,500 catties of kerosene, more than 99,000 catties of bran, and 117 bolts of foreign cloth. These were supplied to the needs of cooperative members and the masses, and cooperative members were given preferential treatment to purchase goods below market prices. As a result, the organization of the cooperative was expanded, with more than 1,100 new members and ten village cooperatives established, effectively supporting disaster victims to help themselves through production. In order to solve the sales problem, the cooperative also established a whole village factory to export in whole village batches. Currently, sales are sluggish due to the off-season. The more than 200 packages of braided straw hats that Xingji Branch has not yet sold, in addition to supplying Xian County for the manufacture of straw hats, Xingji Branch has also negotiated with the district's People's Bank to jointly operate, with the bank providing 110 million yuan for the branch to store a large amount of straw hats, in order to support disaster victims' production and overcome the disaster.

　　河北沧县专区供销社
    扶助灾民生产自救  收购帽辫整庄出口
    【本报讯】河北省沧县专区供销社，为整顿该区草帽辫业，扶助灾民生产自救，在沧县兴济镇建立草帽辫重点社，以大量收购，整庄出口。按该专区草帽辫业素有基础，仅青县、黄骅、建国、沧县、献县即有八百六十六个村十二万余人有编帽辫技术。但因过去产品多由洋行贱价收购，编辫农民在生产上无利可图，大部停止生产，草帽辫业遂告衰退。沧县专区供销社为扶助灾民生产自救，一面与国营出口公司取得联系，扩展销路；一面又与各产地县社建立代收关系。并根据天津行情统一规定价格，分头收购。自去年六月兴济分社成立至十二月，该社与各产辫县合作统一收购草帽辫十九万七千七百四十斤，出口草帽辫十二万余斤，换回杂粮九十六万余斤、煤油三千五百余斤、麸子九万九千余斤，洋布一百一十七匹。供给社员和群众需要，并给予社员低于市价购货的优待。因此扩大了合作社的组织，计发展社员一千一百余人，已建立村社十个，有力地支持了灾民生产自救。该社为解决销路问题，又建立了整庄工厂，以整庄出口。目前因是背月，销路不畅。兴济分社未销出之二百多包草帽辫，除供给献县制造草帽外，兴济分社并已与该区人民银行商妥合营，自银行出款一亿一千万元交与该社大量收存，以扶持灾民生产，渡过灾荒。
