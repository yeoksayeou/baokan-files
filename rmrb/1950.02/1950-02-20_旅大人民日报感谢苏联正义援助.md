Xinhua News Agency, Dalian, 17th. The Lüda People's Daily published an editorial on the 12th entitled "Long Live Sino-Soviet Friendship and Cooperation." The editorial first explained that the warm support of the million people of Lüda for the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance and the two agreements was by no means accidental. The editorial said: We once wore the shackles of slavery for many years, and they were broken by the heroic Soviet army. Only in this way could we stand up and become masters of our own destiny. Moreover, thanks to the protection and assistance of the Soviet army, we were spared the destruction of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit war, and we victoriously overcame the various difficulties caused by the Chiang Kai-shek bandit blockade, restored industry, and developed production, so that we have been able to live freely in a peaceful working environment for the four years since liberation. In the process of work and construction, the Soviet expert comrades have constantly given us selfless and most attentive help, taught us skills, and improved our levels in all aspects. The editorial finally pointed out that, according to the overall tasks of the country and the instructions of the Northeast Bureau of the CPC and the Northeast People's Government, the central task of the Lüda area is economic construction, especially industrial construction. In order to do this work well, it is necessary to develop culture and train various construction cadres. The most important of these is to continue to implement and strengthen internationalist education and earnestly learn from the Soviet Union.

　　旅大人民日报感谢苏联正义援助
    【新华社大连十七日电】旅大人民日报十二日以“中苏友好合作万岁”为题发表社论。社论首先说明旅大百万人民对中苏签订友好同盟互助条约与两个协定的热烈拥护绝不是偶然的。社论说：我们曾经披戴过多年的奴隶枷锁，是由英勇的苏军亲手打破的。这样我们才能站起来成为自己命运的主持者。又由于苏军的保卫和援助，我们得以免遭蒋匪战争的破坏，并胜利地克服了由于蒋匪封锁所造成的各种困难，恢复了工业，发展了生产，使我们解放以来四年时间都能自由生活于和平工作的环境中。而在工作和建设的进程当中，苏联的专家同志们又不断的给了我们以无私和最精心的帮助，教给我们本事，提高我们各方面的水平。社论最后指出：根据全国的总任务和中共东北局及东北人民政府的指示，旅大全区的中心任务是经济建设，特别是工业建设。为了做好这一工作，就要发展文化，培养各种建设干部。这其中最主要的是，要继续贯彻和加强国际主义的教育，切实向苏联学习。
