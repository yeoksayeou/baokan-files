　　Conscientiously Do a Good Job in Grain Storage
Agricultural tax is one of the main sources of national finance at present. In the Central People's Government's 1950 national financial budget, agricultural tax accounted for 41.4% of the total national revenue. This is a very important figure. At present, most parts of the country have completed the autumn grain collection work. The southern and southwestern new districts are also making every effort to complete the unfulfilled part of the autumn grain collection. A large number of public grains across the country have been collected and put into storage or are about to be put into storage. After these scattered public grains are concentrated, how to do a good job in the storage of public grains is the first major issue after collection. In particular, this year's public grain storage has decided to adopt the principle of centralized management to facilitate national and regional transshipment. This is a major progress in the history of grain work. However, due to the implementation of centralized storage, new problems have been raised in grain storage work, namely, how to properly store a large amount of concentrated grain.

　　Here, the first is the issue of safety, and the second is the issue of warehouse equipment and storage experience.

　　The concentration of public grain has many benefits, but the risks are also increased. Even a slight negligence will result in heavy losses. If losses occur, on the one hand, it will let down the hard-working farmers, and on the other hand, it will greatly harm the national finance, and military and civilian food supplies will be affected. This danger mainly comes from two aspects. First, it is the sabotage of the enemy; second, it is the shortcomings in our work. The former danger may occur in all parts of the country, and special attention should be paid to it in the newly liberated areas, and there should be no slackness. Liban Village in Sheng County, Zhejiang Province, has implemented day and night patrols of the granary, showing their necessary vigilance against the danger of enemy sabotage. In addition to enemy sabotage, shortcomings in our own work may also cause great losses of public grain, such as fire, mildew, theft, etc. Such losses have been constantly occurring in various places over the years. Last November, the inspection of warehouses in various places by the Hebei Provincial Grain Bureau reflected that in some places in our old liberated areas, there were still serious shortcomings in the storage of public grain. This is mainly due to the bureaucratic work style of some of our grain storage workers. If this bad work style is not paid attention to and overcome, it is more likely to be used by saboteurs to cause greater damage, which must be guarded against.

　　Secondly, there is the issue of warehouse equipment and storage experience. After the concentration of public grain, many places reported that the warehouses were not enough, and there was not much experience in centralized storage. This must be overcome by all means. However, the basic way to overcome these difficulties is to give full play to subjective efforts according to the possible conditions in various places and take various measures suitable for the conditions in various places to complete the task of centralized grain storage. Because the current economic situation of our country is still at a difficult juncture, and there will be a serious battle on the economic front this year to stabilize finance and prices and enable the country to enter the road of universal economic recovery and construction. We still need to rely on public grain as an important pillar of national finance, but at the same time, we have not yet been able to build a large number of modern warehouses to store the concentrated public grain, and even a large number of repairs to the original warehouses cannot be completely done. This is a contradiction, but we must be good at using various possible conditions in the local area to overcome this contradiction and complete our tasks. Regarding the issue of management experience, some of our comrades still do not have more scientific management methods and lack the necessary scientific equipment. However, we have had experience in preventing moisture, preventing leakage, sun exposure, and ventilation in the past. As long as we can be serious and responsible, earnestly grasp the warehouse situation, rely on the masses, pay attention to it in time, and gradually learn new methods, we can continuously improve our work and avoid various losses.

　　All grain storage workers must understand the importance of their work and the glory of their posts, and conscientiously and earnestly do their work well, and fight to protect the property of the people's motherland and defend the national finance.

### 认真作好粮食保管工作

　　认真作好粮食保管工作
    农业税是国家目前的主要财政来源之一，在中央人民政府一九五○年全国财政概算中，农业税占了国家全部岁入的百分之四十一点四。这是一个十分重要的数字。目前，全国各地大半已完成秋征工作，南方及西南部分新区对秋征未完成部分，亦正在全力进行中。全国大批公粮已收缴入库或即将入库。当这些分散的公粮集中起来之后，如何作好公粮的保管工作，便是征收以后的第一个重大问题。特别是今年公粮保管决定采用集中管理的方针，以便利于全国性及区域性的调运，这，在粮食工作的历史上是一大进步。但是由于实行集中保管，在粮食保管工作上就提出了新问题，即如何妥善地保管大量集中的粮食问题。
    这里，首先是安全问题，其次是仓库设备与保管经验问题。
    公粮集中，好处很多，但危险性也因而加大，偶有疏忽，损失必重。如果损失发生，一方面对不起辛苦耕种的农民，另方面则大大地有害于国家财政，军需民食，将受影响。这种危险，主要来自两个方面，第一，是敌人的破坏，第二是我们工作上的缺点。前一种危险，各地均可能发生，在新解放区更应当特别注意，不能有丝毫疲麻现象。浙江嵊县里坂村对于粮库实行了日夜巡逻的办法，表现他们对敌人破坏危险有了必要的警惕性。在敌人破坏之外，我们自己工作中的缺点也可能造成公粮极大的损失，如火灾，霉烂，偷盗等，这种损失，历年来各地均曾不断发生过，去年十一月河北省粮食局对于各地仓库的检查，反映出我们老解放区的公粮保管工作，有些地方仍然有严重的缺点。这主要是由我们有些粮食保管工作同志还有官僚主义作风。这种坏作风如不注意克服，更有可能为破坏分子所利用，造成更大的破坏，必须加以警惕。
    其次，是关于仓库设备与保管经验问题。公粮集中后，许多地方反映仓库不够，而集中保管的经验又不多。这是必须设法加以克服的。但是，克服这些困难的基本办法，在于根据各地可能的条件，发挥主观力量，采取适合于各地情况的各种办法，完成粮食集中保管的任务。因为，我们国家的经济现状，还是处在困难关头，今年在经济战线上还须有一场严重的战斗，才能平定金融与物价，使国家进入经济普遍恢复与建设的大道。我们现在还须一方面依托公粮，作为国家财政的重要支柱，但同时，却还没有可能大量修建近代仓库来存放集中的公粮，甚至大量修理原有仓库也不能完全办到。这是一个矛盾，但我们必须善于运用当地各种可能条件克服这一个矛盾，完成我们的任务。关于管理经验问题，我们有些同志一时还不会更科学的管理方法，也缺乏必要的科学设备，但是，防潮、防漏、日晒、通风这些经验，我们过去就是有的，只要我们能认真负责，切实掌握仓库情况，依靠群众，及时加以注意，并逐步学习新方法，是可以不断改进我们的工作，避免各种损失的。
    一切粮食保管工作人员，必须了解自己工作的重要，岗位之光荣，切切实实，认真作好自己的工作，为保护人民祖国财产与保卫国家财政而斗争。
