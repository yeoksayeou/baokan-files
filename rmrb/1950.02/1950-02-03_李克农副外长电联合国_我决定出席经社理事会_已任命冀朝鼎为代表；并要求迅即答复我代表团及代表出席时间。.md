　　Li Kenong, Deputy Foreign Minister, Cables the United Nations: I Have Decided to Attend the Economic and Social Council; Ji Chao Ding Has Been Appointed as Representative; and a Prompt Reply is Requested Regarding the Time of Arrival for Our Delegation and Representatives.
Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, February 2nd: Deputy Foreign Minister Li Kenong of our Ministry of Foreign Affairs sent a cable to the United Nations today, informing them that the Central People's Government of our country has appointed Ji Chao Ding as the representative of our country to attend the United Nations Economic and Social Council meeting on February 7th. Deputy Foreign Minister Li Kenong believes that it is unreasonable for the various organizations of the United Nations to still not expel the illegal representatives of the Kuomintang reactionary remnant group, and requested the United Nations to promptly notify the delegation headed by Zhang Wentian and Ji Chao Ding of the time to attend the relevant organizations of the United Nations. The text of the cable is as follows:

To Mr. Romulo, President of the United Nations General Assembly, Mr. Trygve Lie, Secretary-General, and please forward to the delegations of all member states of the United Nations and the Economic and Social Council:

On January 19, 1950, Minister of Foreign Affairs Zhou Enlai of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China sent a note to you, stating that the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China has appointed Zhang Wentian as the chief representative of the delegation of the People's Republic of China to attend United Nations meetings and participate in United Nations work, including meetings and work of the Security Council, and requested that it be forwarded to the United Nations and the delegations of all member states of the Security Council. However, more than ten days have passed, and the Security Council and organizations affiliated with the United Nations are still allowing the illegal representatives of the Chinese Kuomintang reactionary remnant group to remain, and have not immediately expelled them. I believe this is unreasonable. Now the United Nations Economic and Social Council will meet again on February 7th. I hereby further notify you, Mr. President and Secretary-General, that the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China has appointed Ji Chao Ding as the representative of the People's Republic of China to attend the United Nations Economic and Social Council. Please forward this to all relevant parties immediately, and promptly reply as to when the legitimate delegation of the People's Republic of China headed by Zhang Wentian and Ji Chao Ding can attend the United Nations Security Council and the Economic and Social Council.

Li Kenong, Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China
February 2, 1950

　　李克农副外长电联合国  我决定出席经社理事会
    已任命冀朝鼎为代表；并要求迅即答复我代表团及代表出席时间。
    【新华社北京二日电】我国外交部李克农副部长本日致电联合国，告以我国中央人民政府已任命冀朝鼎为我国出席将于二月七日开会的联合国经济暨社会理事会的代表。李克农副部长认为联合国各组织迄今仍不开除国民党反动派残余集团的非法代表是不合理的，并要求联合国迅速通知以张闻天为首的代表团及冀朝鼎出席联合国有关组织的时间。电文如下：
    联合国大会主席罗慕洛先生，秘书长赖伊先生并请转达联合国及经济暨社会理事会各会员国代表团：
    一九五○年一月十九日，中华人民共和国中央人民政府外交部周恩来部长曾向阁下发出照会，申明中华人民共和国中央人民政府业已任命张闻天为中华人民共和国出席联合国会议和参加联合国工作包括安全理事会的会议及其工作的代表团的首席代表，并请转达联合国及安全理事会各会员国。乃时隔旬余，安全理事会及联合国所属各组织尚容留中国国民党反动残余集团的非法代表在内，而不将其立即开除出去。我认为这是不合理的。现在联合国经济暨社会理事会又将于二月七日开会。我再通知阁下，主席和秘书长先生，中华人民共和国中央人民政府业已任命冀朝鼎为中华人民共和国出席联合国经济暨社会理事会的代表。请即转达有关各方，并将以张闻天为首席代表的合法的中华人民共和国的代表团及冀朝鼎何时可以出席联合国安全理事会及经济暨社会理事会的问题，迅予答复，为盼。
            中华人民共和国中央人民政府外交部副部长李克农
              一九五○年二月二日
