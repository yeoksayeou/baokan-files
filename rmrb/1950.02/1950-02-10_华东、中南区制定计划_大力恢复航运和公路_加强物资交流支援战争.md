Based on the decisions of the national shipping and highway conferences and the specific conditions of each region, these two conferences formulated work guidelines for 1950. Both regional conferences emphasized that the most urgent task at present is to actively restore shipping and highways to support the People's Liberation Army in liberating Taiwan, Hainan Island, and other places, and to strengthen material exchange between regions. The East China Region shipping conference decided to complete the unification of East China's shipping organizations and operations in a planned and focused manner, and to concentrate scattered materials from various places to strengthen material exchange between urban and rural areas. To this end, the conference also decided to vigorously organize wooden boats for transportation, establish transportation stations in various places, investigate sources of goods, proactively establish close contact with local governments, trade departments, and consigning agencies, and implement the freight rate policy of "low profit, high volume" and "decreasing rate with distance." The transportation conference held in the Central South Region decided to quickly complete the establishment of the Yangtze River Navigation Bureau and its branches, vigorously organize transportation capacity, and accelerate turnover rate. The conference determined specific figures for organizing various ships and passenger and freight transportation along the Yangtze River, and planned to salvage 36 sunken ships in the Yangtze River and repair 39 ships, totaling more than 100,000 tons. The conference also decided to actively reorganize wharves and warehouses in various ports, and solve the management of pilot personnel.
