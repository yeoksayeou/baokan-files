　　Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, February 26th: The results of the British parliamentary election held on the 23rd are in for 620 of the 625 seats. The Labor Party and the Conservative Party, relying on the undemocratic electoral system favorable to them and their massive election machines, have almost evenly divided the seats in the House of Commons. The Labor Party won 315 seats in the House of Commons out of 625 (compared to 394 in the previous term), the Conservative Party won 294 seats (if the seats of the group allied with the Conservatives this time are excluded, the Conservatives had 192 seats in the previous House of Commons), the Liberal Party 9 seats (10 in the previous term), and the Northern Ireland Alliance 2 seats. The Conservative Party made every effort to arrange a restoration before the election and took advantage of the undemocratic election, but still failed to win the most seats in the House of Commons. The Labor Party lost more than 70 seats in this election compared to the last one, which is the result of its anti-Soviet and anti-people policies pursued for the past four and a half years. The failure of all one hundred candidates of the British Communist Party and five independent left-wing Labor Party members to be elected fully demonstrates the undemocratic nature of British elections. In the future, the British Communists and all progressive forces will continue to work tirelessly outside Parliament for the benefit of the British working people.

    英共将团结进步力量在议会外继续斗争
    【新华社北京二十六日电】二十三日举行的英国国会选举的结果，六百二十五席中已有六百二十席已经揭晓。工党与保守党凭借对他们有利的、不民主的选举制度和庞大的选举机器，几乎平分了下院的议席。工党在下院六百二十五席中得三百一十五席（前届是三百九十四席），保守党得二百九十四席（如果除去这次与保守党结盟的集团的议席，保守党在前届下院中是一百九十二席），另外自由党九席（前届为十席），北爱尔兰联盟二席。保守党在选举前全力作种种复辟布置，并利用选举的不民主，但仍然未能获得下院议席的最多数。工党在这次选举中较上次减少了七十多席，这是它四年半来所推行的反苏反人民政策的结果。英国共产党的一百名候选人和五名左翼工党独立分子都没有当选，充分说明了英国选举的不民主的实质。今后英国共产党人与一切进步力量将继续不懈地在议会之外，为英国劳动人民的利益而奋斗。
