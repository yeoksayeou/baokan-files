　　Xinhua News Agency dispatch: Shanghai's one million workers have been initially organized. According to statistics from the end of December last year, the city has organized twenty-four industrial trade unions and ten industrial trade union preparatory committees, established four hundred and twelve grassroots trade unions and eight hundred and forty-eight grassroots trade union preparatory committees. A total of nine hundred and thirty-eight thousand four hundred and fifty-seven employees have been initially organized, accounting for 87.52 percent of the city's one million seventy-two thousand one hundred and thirty-four employees. Among them, approximately 400,000 members were newly organized in December of last year and are currently going through membership procedures.
　　Establish Employee Associations Based on Specific Characteristics of Each Industry System
　　The Shanghai Federation of Trade Unions Preparatory Committee was established on May 31st, the fifth day after the liberation of Shanghai. After its establishment, it organized one hundred and three working groups, belonging to fifteen industrial system trade union work committees, to conduct work among the working masses of various industrial systems. The method of organizing workers was initially to establish contact with the broad masses of employees through progressive organizations such as the People's Security Team, Factory Protection Team, Workers' Association, and Staff Association, and then to prepare for the establishment of unified employee organizations for each industry in a planned and focused manner. When establishing employee associations, different characteristics and circumstances were taken into account: in large units and state-owned enterprises with an organizational foundation, the original organization was expanded, new activists were widely absorbed, and trade union preparatory committees were established. Then, through the upsurge of workers participating in takeover work and the six major tasks of large-scale celebrations, parades, army support, and the implementation of the anti-blockade struggle after liberation, opportunities were seized to carry out extensive publicity, improve workers' political awareness and sense of ownership, and establish trade unions on the basis of consolidated employee unity. In industries with only gangs or old trade union organizations in the past, such as hotels and handicrafts, the leaders of the original old trade unions and gangs were educated and reformed as a bridge to connect with the masses, in order to establish new unified employee associations that truly represent the interests of workers. Facts have proven that these old trade union and gang leaders are generally able to be educated and reformed. However, a small number of reactionary elements who continue to engage in sabotage and disruption are resolutely purged. In various industries that had no organization in the past, activists were first selected to participate in worker study classes for short-term education, serving as the organizational core, and preparatory institutions were established to further mobilize the working masses. Other examples include the dockworkers' union, which was established during the struggle to eliminate "Da Bao" (major foremen) by mobilizing dockworkers to abolish feudal exploitation. In factories where reactionary elements are still rampant, workers were first mobilized to launch an anti-espionage struggle, and then new democratic trade unions were established on the basis of uniting activists and generally improving the awareness of the working class.
　　Exposing Capitalist Attempts to Sow Discord and Increase the Awareness of the Working Class
　　When organizing trade unions in some private enterprises, capitalists attempted to obstruct the organization of trade unions, or attempted to organize capitalist-controlled trade unions, in an open or secret manner, to sow discord and divide employee unity. Trade union staff exposed such illegal behavior by capitalists to the working masses, helped workers improve their class consciousness, and at the same time reasoned with the capitalists and criticized the mistakes of this approach. Through the efforts of trade union staff and workers, the workers in these enterprises were also organized.
　　Experience has proven that the establishment and development of trade unions must revolve around the central link of production. In Shanghai's state-owned enterprises, trade unions that cooperated well with the administration in inventory taking over, emergency repairs, disaster relief, savings, and production have more sound organizations and can more easily develop membership; otherwise, it is difficult to achieve results. The main shortcomings in Shanghai's trade union work are that many trade union cadres have been working in secret for a long time under reactionary rule, lack experience in public work, and are not good at promoting democracy; at the same time, in large-scale movements, some trade union staff are not good at combining the workers' immediate concerns with political education, thus resulting in a phenomenon of being divorced from the masses. These shortcomings are being gradually overcome in the work process.

　　上海百万工人初步组织起来
    【新华社电】上海市的百万工人已经初步组织起来。据去年十二月底统计，全市已经组织了二十四个产业工会和十个产业工会筹备会，成立了四百十二个基层工会和八百四十八个基层工会筹备会，业已初步组织起来的职工共有九十三万八千四百五十七人，占全市职工一百零七万二千一百三十四人中的百分之八十七点五二。其中约有四十万会员是在去年十二月份刚刚组织起来的，目前正在普遍办理入会手续中。
  根据各产业系统具体特点建立职工会
    上海总工会筹备委员会于去年五月三十一日上海解放后的第五天成立，成立后，即组织了一百零三个工作组，分属于十五个产业系统的工会工作委员会，分别深入各产业系统的工人群众中进行工作。组织工人的方法，首先是通过解放前的地下组织如人民保安队、护厂队、工人协会、职员协会等进步组织中的积极分子，与广大的职工群众建立联系，随即有计划有重点地筹备建立各产业的统一的职工组织。建立职工会时，根据各种不同的特点和情况进行：在有组织基础的大单位和国营企业中，是扩大原有组织，广泛吸收新的积极分子，成立工会筹备会。然后通过工人参加接管工作的热潮和解放后的几次大规模庆祝游行、劳军、执行反封锁斗争的六大任务等，抓紧时机进行广泛宣传，提高工人政治觉悟及主人翁思想，在巩固了的职工大团结的基础上建立工会。在过去只有帮会或旧工会组织的行业，如旅馆、手工业中，则对原有旧工会、帮会的领导人进行教育和改造，作为联系群众的桥梁，以便建立真正代表工人利益的新的统一的职工会。事实证明，这些旧工会和帮会负责人一般都是能够教育、改造的。但对于少数继续进行破坏捣乱的反动分子，则坚决予以肃清。在过去完全没有组织的各行业，则首先选拔积极分子参加工人学习班加以短期教育，作为组织核心，建立筹备机构，以便进一步发动工人群众。其他如码头工会则是通过反封建剥削，在发动码头工人解除大包（大工头）的斗争中建立职工自己的组织的。在反动分子依然猖獗的工厂中，首先发动工人展开反特务斗争，然后在团结积极分子并普遍提高工人阶级觉悟的基础上，建立民主的新工会。
  揭破资方挑拨分化提高工人阶级觉悟
    在某些私营企业组织工会时，资方曾企图阻碍组织工会，或者企图组织资方御用的工会，以公开的或秘密的方式，挑拨分化职工的团结。工会工作人员曾向工人群众揭发了资方这种违法行为，帮助工人提高了阶级觉悟，同时正面与资方讲理，并批评了他们这种作法的错误。经过工会工作人员和工人的努力，这些企业的工人也组织了起来。
    经验证明，建立与发展工会必须围绕着生产的中心环节进行。上海国营企业的工会，凡是配合行政在清点接管、抢修、救台灾、节约、生产等工作中做得较好的，组织就比较健全，会员就容易发展，反之则不易获得成绩。在上海工会工作中发生的主要缺点，是很多工会干部都在反动统治下长期作秘密工作，缺乏公开工作的经验，不善于发扬民主；同时，在大规模运动中，有些工会工作人员也不善于把工人群众的切身问题与政治教育相结合，因此发生了脱离群众的现象。这些缺点已在工作过程中注意逐步克服。
