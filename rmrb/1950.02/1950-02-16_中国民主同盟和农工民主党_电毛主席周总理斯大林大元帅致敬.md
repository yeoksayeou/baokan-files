　　Chairman Mao, Premier Zhou:

　　You have worked tirelessly and traveled to the Soviet Union to conclude the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance, and Mutual Assistance, and the agreements on loans and the return of the Changchun Railway, Lushunkou (Port Arthur), and Dalian. These great achievements are unprecedented in Chinese history and have made a significant contribution to the cause of peace and democracy throughout the world.
