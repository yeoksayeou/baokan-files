　　Tianjin Strengthens Tax Evasion Inspections
　　Commodity Tax Revenue Increases by Half
　　[Report from this newspaper] Since the Tianjin Tax Bureau established mass-based tax evasion inspection and anti-smuggling work, tax revenue has greatly increased. Commodity tax alone has increased to 142 percent. The Tianjin Municipal Tax Inspection Work only began to list inspection work as one of the central tasks in mid-November of last year, and established various inspection systems, began to organize an intelligence network among progressive workers, and launched publicity and education work. The focus of the inspection was on clearing stamp duty, business tax, feast tax and entertainment tax. During the inspection, it was discovered that the number of households with tax evasion behavior accounted for 60 percent of the inspected households. Among them, tax evasion was most common in business tax, stamp duty, and feast tax. Eighty percent of the stamps affixed by small and medium-sized handicraft cigarette factories were forged! This shows the seriousness of the tax evasion phenomenon. While inspecting tax evasion, the Tianjin Tax Bureau also conducted education for industrialists and businessmen to correct their tax evasion thoughts. The handling of tax evaders, except for those with particularly serious cases, generally followed the principle of "strict investigation and lenient punishment," ordering them to pay in kind. After this inspection and publicity, the understanding of the general industrialists and businessmen has been improved, and tax evasion behavior has been significantly reduced. For example, the First Tax Office of the Third Branch of the Bureau sold only over 6 million yuan in stamps on November 16th and 17th, but reached over 10 million yuan on the 28th and 29th. The income of the Third Branch in late November was only 165,653,635 yuan, but reached 267,288,064 yuan in early December. According to statistics, Tianjin's regular tax revenue in December last year increased by 78.57 percent compared to November. Commodity tax, which everyone thought would not change much in the past, actually increased by 142 percent, mining tax increased by 167 percent, while business tax increased by 79 percent, stamp duty increased by 48 percent, entertainment tax increased by 34 percent, feast tax increased by 77 percent, and interest income tax increased by 64 percent.

　　天津加强稽查漏税
    货物税收入增加一倍半
    【本报讯】天津税务局自建立群众性的稽查缉私工作以后，税收大为增加。仅货物税一项即增至百分之一四二。天津市的税务稽查工作是去年十一月中旬才开始将稽查工作列为中心工作之一，并建立各种稽查制度，开始在进步的职工群众中组织情报网，展开宣传教育工作。并以清理印花税、行商税、筵席税和娱乐税为重点进行检查。在检查中，发现有逃税行为的户数占检查户数的百分之六十。其中尤以行商税、印花税、筵席税的逃税最多。中小手工业烟厂所贴的印花，百分之八十是伪造的！可见逃税现象之严重了。与检查漏税同时，天津税务局并向工商业者进行教育，纠正其逃税思想。对于逃税者的处理，除案情特别严重者，一般都本着“严查轻处”的方针，令其折实补纳。经过了这次的检查和宣传后，一般工商业者的认识已提高一步，逃税行为有显著的减少。如该局三分局第一税务所于十一月十六、七两天，每天售印花不过六百余万元，到二十八、二十九两天，每天则达一千多万元。三分局在十一月下旬收入仅一六五六五三六三五元，十二月上旬则达二六七二八八○六四元。据统计：天津去年十二月份的经常税款收入，比十一月份增加百分之七八．五七。过去大家认为无多大变动的货物税，竟增加了百分之一四二，矿业税增加百分之一六七，其他如行商税增加了百分之七九，印花税增加百分之四八，娱乐税增加百分之三四，筵席税增加百分之七七，利息所得税增加百分之六四。
