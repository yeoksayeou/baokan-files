　　People's Representatives Conference Plays an Important Role in Promoting the Basic Completion of Autumn Grain Collection in Hebei; Cotton and Peanut Collection Tasks Exceed Original Plans

　　[Report from this newspaper] The 1949 autumn grain collection task in Hebei Province has been basically and victoriously completed. The task of converting public grain into cotton has been fully completed, and the task of converting public grain into peanuts has exceeded the original plan by more than 14 million catties. As of the end of January, the province had completed 92% of the total autumn grain collection. Among them, Shijiazhuang Prefecture completed 103%, Baoding Prefecture completed 101.4%, and Handan, Hengshui, Xingtai, Dingxian, Tangshan, and Cangxian six prefectures have nearly completed all tasks. Tianjin Prefecture completed 74%, and Tongxian Prefecture completed 76%. These prefectures that have not completed their tasks are still continuing. Based on the above collection situation, it is estimated that the province's autumn grain collection task can be fully completed. Hebei's autumn grain collection this year was carried out shortly after the establishment of the province, with incomplete understanding of the situation, serious disasters, and insufficient grasp of the disaster situation in the early stage. However, why was it possible to achieve the above results? There are mainly the following reasons:

　　Farmers Have High Political Awareness - Recognizing that Bearing the Burden of Supporting the Front is the Most Glorious

　　I. Due to the encouragement of the national victory situation, the gradual stabilization of social order, and the recognition by the farmers that bearing the burden of supporting the front is the most glorious task, the smooth progress of the autumn grain collection work has been greatly promoted. For example, in Jingxing County, which belongs to Shijiazhuang Prefecture, the entire collection was completed in seven days. In Lishu Village, Qiqu District, Fuping, before the grain collection was even arranged, seven households voluntarily paid 500 catties of public grain, saying that paying public grain is the glorious duty of citizens. Fu Huanjie, a liberated peasant woman from Zhangjiagou, Wuqu District, the county, after the public grain was arranged, she immediately milled six large dou of grain overnight and personally carried it twenty li away to deliver the public grain the next morning. Because the broad masses of farmers have a high degree of political awareness, they actively pay public grain and strive to pay more and better public grain. Yu Zhihai, a liberated peasant from Liuchu District, Jingxing, after paying off his own public grain, took out another bag of good grain and exchanged it for households with poor grain quality to pay.

　　Arranging Autumn Grain Collection Through People's Representatives Conferences - Representatives' In-depth Propaganda Played a Major Role

　　II. Arranging autumn grain collection through people's representatives conferences is the best way to smoothly carry out autumn grain collection work. In the province's 133 counties, 93 counties convened people's representatives conferences to discuss and arrange autumn grain collection, so that the government's burden policy could penetrate into the broad masses through the propaganda of the representatives. Furthermore, because the opinions of the representatives from all walks of life were widely listened to, the burden was made fair and reasonable on the whole, which is an important reason for the smooth progress of the autumn grain collection work. For example, Zhang Guijin, a female representative from Zhangbei Village, Wuqu District, Jingxing, immediately went into the masses to mobilize them after returning to the village from the representative conference, and mobilized women to grind rice and deliver grain. Most of the public grain in the village was transported by women, and the task was completed in two days.

　　Leaders at All Levels Attach Importance to Autumn Grain Collection - Unified Steps and Concentrated Strength

　　III. Leaders at all levels attach importance to the autumn grain collection work and give full play to the strength of the organization. For example, Shimen Prefecture designated autumn grain collection as the central work for a certain period and put forward the slogan "If autumn grain collection is not done well, the work for the year will be passive," so as to concentrate strength and unify work steps, enabling the autumn grain collection to be overfulfilled. For example, after receiving the provincial government's deadline for allocating 33 million catties of grain to the grain company on January 20, the Cangxian Prefectural Commissioner's Office immediately transferred cadres and rushed to various counties overnight to make arrangements for the autumn grain collection at the people's representatives conference being held. With the joint efforts of cadres at all levels and representatives from all walks of life, the entire prefecture's autumn grain collection was completed in just nine days, and was rewarded by the provincial government.

　　IV. The lead taken by cadres, Party members, and Youth League members has played a role in promoting the autumn grain collection work. For example, in Dashiqiao Village, Liuchu District, Zhaoxian County, on the first day of the collection, all 31 Party members paid off their dues, which promoted the completion of the task in the village in four days. For example, Zhao Lanying, a female cadre from Houting Village, Qiqu District, Jingxing, organized women to deliver grain, which influenced women in nearby villages and set off a wave of grain delivery. However, there are also a few villages where the collection work has been slow due to the disunity of cadres.

### 各界代表会议起重要推动作用  河北秋征基本完成  棉花、花生征收任务超过原订计划

　　各界代表会议起重要推动作用
    河北秋征基本完成
    棉花、花生征收任务超过原订计划
    【本报讯】河北省一九四九年度的秋征任务，已在基本上胜利完成。公粮折征棉花的任务已全部完成，公粮折征花生的任务超过原订计划一千四百多万斤。截至一月底止，全省已完成秋征总数的百分之九十二。其中石家庄专区完成百分之一百零三，保定专区完成百分之一百零一点四，邯郸、衡水、邢台、定县、唐山、沧县六个专区已接近全部完成任务，天津专区完成百分之七四，通县专区完成百分之七十六。这些没有完成任务的专区仍在继续进行中。根据以上征收情况，估计全省秋征任务能够全部完成。河北今年的秋征是在建省不久，情况不完全了解，灾情严重而在初期又对灾情掌握不够的情况下进行的，但是，为什么能取得上述的成绩呢？主要有以下几个原因：
    农民群众政治觉悟高  认识负担支前最光荣
    一、由于全国胜利形势的鼓舞、社会秩序的逐步安定及农民群众认识了负担支前是最光荣的任务，因此大大推动了秋征工作的顺利开展。如石家庄专区所属井陉县，七天就完成了全部征收。阜平七区栗树村在征粮还未布置前，就有七户自动缴公粮五百斤，并说：缴公粮是公民的光荣义务。该县五区张家沟翻身农妇傅焕姐，在公粮布置下来后，她就连夜碾了六大斗谷子，第二天早晨亲自背了二十里路远把公粮送去。由于广大农民群众具有高度的政治觉悟，他们积极缴纳公粮，并争取多缴好公粮。井陉六区翻身农民于智海，缴清了自己的公粮，又拿出一口袋好粮，换给粮质坏的户去缴。
    通过各界代表会布置秋征  代表深入宣传起了大作用
    二、通过各界代表会议布置秋征，是秋征工作顺利开展的最好方式。全省一百三十三县，就有九十三县召开了各界代表会议，讨论布置秋征，使政府的负担政策通过代表的宣传深入到广大群众中去；更由于广泛听取了各界代表们的意见，使负担在大体上作到了公平合理，这是使秋征工作顺利开展的重要原因。如井陉五区张北村女代表张桂金，开完代表会回到村里即在群众中深入动员，发动妇女碾米送粮，全村公粮大部由妇女运送，两天就完成了任务。
    各级领导重视秋征  步调一致力量集中
    三、各级领导重视秋征工作，充分发挥了组织的力量，如石门专区把秋征订为一定时期的中心工作，并提出“秋征搞不好，一年工作处于被动”的号召，作到力量集中，工作步调一致，使秋征能够超额完成。又如沧县专署在一月二十日接到省府限期向粮食公司拨粮三千三百万斤的借征任务后，立即抽调干部，连夜赶赴各县，在正在召开的各界代表会上作了秋征布置。在各级干部、各界代表的共同努力下，全专区的秋征九天即全部完成任务，得到了省府的奖励。
    四、干部与党团员带头，对于秋征工作起了推动作用。如赵县六区大石桥村在开征的第一天，即有党员三十一名全部缴清，推动了该村四天完成任务。又如井陉七区后亭村女干部赵兰英，组织妇女送粮，影响了附近村庄的妇女，掀起了送粮热潮。但也有少数村庄因干部不团结，影响征收工作进行迟缓。
