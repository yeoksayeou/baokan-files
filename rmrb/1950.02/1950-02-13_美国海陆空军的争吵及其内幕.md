　　The Dispute Among the US Army, Navy, and Air Force and Its Inside Story
    Wang Zhanglin
    After the myth of the American atomic bomb finally went bankrupt, the religion of worshiping weapons is still popular, which shows that American capitalists are still trying to save the economic crisis by expanding armaments.
    In the expansion of armaments, the arms race among the US Army, Navy, and Air Force occurred first. They represent the interests of different arms dealers, and they are unwilling to give in to each other when dividing the military spending that accounts for 60% of the national expenditure.
    In the clamor of actively preparing for war, the tunes they are singing are contradictory:
    The Air Force's slogan is "One weapon decides victory or defeat." Air Force Secretary Symington pointed out that the United States relies on Europe and other bases are unreliable. The only hope for victory lies in the B-36 bomber, which can carry atomic bombs from the United States to the Soviet Union. The Air Force also sank an aircraft carrier worth 200 million US dollars in an exercise to prove that the Navy is useless. In addition to proving that naval fighters taking off from aircraft carriers can rise to 40,000 feet and shoot down the B-36 "flying cigars" in six minutes, the naval authorities also threatened with "the Soviet Union has thousands of long-range submarines." The conclusion is naturally: Without the Navy, the United States will be blockaded and become an isolated island in the war--the Navy spokesman is Admiral Halsey.
    Bradley's theory of supporting the Army's funding is even simpler. He said that the Navy and Air Force only destroy, and only the Army can truly defeat the enemy and win the war.
    Of course, American war-mongers, who represent the interests of the monopoly capital that manufactures airplanes, tanks, warships, rifles... will quarrel endlessly in order to seize a larger share of the defense budget for their masters. And the arms manufacturers are rushing to build ever-changing tools of mass slaughter to support their demands for profit.
    Congressman Teed has discovered the fraud in the US Department of Defense's signing of the B-36 bomber purchase contract. He said that the Air Force Department ordered 100 of this type of aircraft from "Vought Unified Company" in 1947, but by the beginning of 1948, according to the report of the Air Force analysts, it was proved that the aircraft could not be used for combat and could only be used as an aerial refueling aircraft, so the contract was reduced to 50 aircraft. The reason for not completely canceling the contract was to avoid too much loss to "Vought Unified Company." At the same time, the Air Force Department ordered a large number of B-50 and B-45 bombers from "Boeing Company." However, in 1949, most of the Air Force's funds were suddenly used to order B-36 bombers, and all of the "Boeing Company's" contracts were canceled.
    According to Teed's investigation, the US Department of Defense restored the order of B-36 bombers with the vast majority of the Air Force's funds in March 1949, and Secretary of Defense Johnson was still serving as the director of "Vought Unified Company," which manufactures B-36 bombers, until March 7 of the same year. Isn't this very simple? Secretary of Defense Johnson ordered the vast majority of the US Air Force's funds to be given to Director Johnson's own "Vought Unified Company" to manufacture B-36 bombers.
    We can find some more materials to help people understand Johnson, understand the US Department of Defense, and thus understand the performance of the B-36 bomber:
    According to US Congressman Teed, Johnson once made a large "investment" in President Truman's campaign. The result of this "investment" was that Mr. Johnson was finally honorably appointed as the US Secretary of Defense. Then he ordered aircraft from his own company on behalf of the government. In addition to recovering the principal of the "investment," there were of course a lot of interest.

　　美国海陆空军的争吵及其内幕
    王章麟
    美国原子弹的神话最后地破产以后，武器崇拜的宗教依然流行，这说明了美国资本家仍然企图以扩张军备来挽救经济危机。
    在扩张军备中，首先发生了美国海、陆、空三方面的军备竞赛。他们代表不同的军火商利益，在瓜分占国家岁出百分之六十的军费时，各不相让。
    在积极备战的叫嚣中，他们高唱着的腔调是互相矛盾的：
    空军的口号是“一种武器决胜负”。空军部长薛明顿指出：美国在欧洲和其他基地都是靠不住的，战胜的希望，唯有寄托于可自美国带原子弹飞往苏联的Ｂ三六型轰炸机。空军并在演习中炸沉价值二亿美元的航空母舰一艘，证明海军无用。海军当局则除了证明航空母舰上起飞的海军战斗机可在六分钟内升高四万英尺，击落Ｂ三六型“飞行雪茄”以外，并以“苏联拥有长程潜艇千艘”相恐吓，结论自然是：若无海军，美国在大战中将被封锁而成孤岛——海军发言人是海尔赛上将。
    布莱德雷支持陆军经费的理论是更简单的。他说，海空军止于破坏而已，真正击倒敌人赢得战争的，唯有陆军。
    当然，代表制造飞机、坦克、军舰、步枪……的独占资本利益的美国战争煽动者们，为了替他们的主子夺取国防经费中的更大份儿，是会争吵不休的。而军火制造商们，则赶造日新月异的大规模屠杀工具，来支持他们对利润的要求。
    众议员曾德特已发现美国国防部在签订Ｂ三六型轰炸机购置合同中的舞弊情形，他说：该型飞机在一九四七年即由空军部向“伏蒂统一公司”订购百架，但到四八年初，因据空军分析家报告，证明该机不能作战，只能用为空中加油机，所以将合同减为五十架，其所以不完全取消合同，是为了免使“伏蒂统一公司”损失太大，同时则空军部另向“波音公司”订购了大批Ｂ五○、Ｂ四五型轰炸机，可是，到了一九四九年，空军经费的大部忽然又被用来订购Ｂ三六型轰炸机，“波音公司”的合同全部都被取消了。
    据曾德特的调查，美国国防部以绝大部份的空军经费恢复订购Ｂ三六型轰炸机乃是一九四九年三月间的事，而国防部长詹逊直到同年三月七号还在兼任制造Ｂ三六型轰炸机的“伏蒂统一公司”董事。这不是很简单吗？国防部长詹逊先生下令将美国空军经费的绝大部份交给董事詹逊先生自己的“伏蒂统一公司”来制造Ｂ三六型轰炸机。
    我们可以再找一点材料来帮助人们了解詹逊，了解美国国防部，从而了解Ｂ三六型轰炸机的性能：
    据美国众议员曾德特说，詹逊曾经大量“投资”于杜鲁门总统的竞选，这“投资”的结果是：詹逊先生终于荣任了美国国防部长。接下去就是他替政府向他自己的公司订购飞机，除了捞回“投资”的本钱以外，当然还有不少利息。
