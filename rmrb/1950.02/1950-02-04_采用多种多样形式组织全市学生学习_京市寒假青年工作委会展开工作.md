　　Adopting Diverse Forms to Organize Citywide Student Learning
    Beijing Municipality Youth Work Committee Deploys Work

    [Report from this newspaper] After the establishment of the Beijing Municipality Winter Vacation Youth Work Committee, various preparatory tasks have been initially completed. With the winter vacation now here, the following tasks will soon be launched:

    1. Youth Lectures. Held separately for university and middle school students: For the university part, the Communist Youth League committees and student unions of Peking University and Tsinghua University will host lectures inside and outside the city respectively. He Sijing, Li Lisan, Qiao Guanhua, Wu Lengxi, Xiao Hua, Han Tianshi, Qian Jiaju, Di Chaobai, Tao Dayong, Ai Siqi, Hu Sheng, Pei Wenzhong, Ding Ling, Zhang Dazhong, and She Shiguang will be invited to lecture on internationalism, international and domestic situations, the new world and new youth, financial and economic policies, the revolutionary outlook on life, methods of thought, natural science, literature and art, the nature and tasks of the Communist Youth League, and organizational discipline. For the middle school part, the city will be divided into five districts: Southeast (Huiwen Middle School), Northeast (Municipal No. 1 Boys' Middle School), Central (Franco-Chinese University), Northwest (Municipal No. 3 Girls' Middle School), and Southeast (Normal University Affiliated Girls' Middle School). Students in each district will be divided into two groups to attend lectures. There will be a total of six lecture topics, with sixty lectures in total, accompanied by appropriate recreational activities (educational films, students' own singing and dancing practices, and small performances, etc.). Qian Junrui, Yang Shu, Yang Fu, Chen Jiakang, Qian Sanqiang, Pei Wenzhong, Yun Ziqiang, Ding Zan, Yuan Hanqing, Miao Peishi, Cheng Jinwu, Ai Qing, Zhang Geng, Ding Ling, Li Bozhao, Ding Haochuan, Sun Dingguo, Hu Hua, and Hu Sheng will be invited to lecture on the Common Program, introduction to the Soviet Union, the nature and tasks of the Communist Youth League, science stories, cultural and artistic discussions, and youth cultivation. The first lecture will be held in districts on February 6th and 7th, and attendance is voluntary.

    2. Communist Youth League Cadre Study Meeting for Universities and Middle Schools. The main topics will be the situation in 1950, deployment of the League's work in schools for the first half of 1950, and the study of branch work methods and leadership methods in conjunction with actual work. Approximately 500 cadres above the university branch committee level and over 800 middle school branch committee cadres will participate. University and middle school cadres will listen to lectures separately in centralized sessions, and then organize discussions in units of branches after returning to their schools.

    3. In order to strengthen the leadership of cultural and artistic activities in schools and cultivate backbone personnel, the Communist Youth League Municipal Work Committee's Literature and Art Department, the Municipal Bureau of Culture and Education's Art Division, the People's Art Theater, and the Municipal Middle and Primary School Music Teaching Research Association will jointly organize cultural and artistic lectures. They will organize over 300 music, art, and physical education teachers from primary and middle schools, and about 200 League members and students from universities and middle schools who are interested in cultural and artistic activities, to study artistic theory and skills. The lectures will cover folk song singing, the guidelines and tasks of Beijing's literary and artistic work in 1950, and school recreational activities. Students participating in the study will also hold skills training classes, divided into three groups based on their specialties: music, drama, and dance, for systematic learning.

    4. Organize the study of Communist Youth League members who are primary school teachers. The content includes the organizational principles of the Communist Youth League, the work of the League among primary school teachers, and work with children, to further improve the work of the Young Pioneers and the work of the League among primary school teachers in the next semester.

    In addition, the Winter Vacation Youth Work Committee plans to organize social service activities. Besides Peking University, Tsinghua University, the Central Academy of Fine Arts, and other schools organizing students to participate in land reform in suburban areas, and eighty university League members going to the countryside to conduct League branch education and serve as political class teachers for winter schools, students are also called upon to actively participate in literacy classes, night schools, and other social education work, and to promote public bonds to family members and friends. Everyone is encouraged to review their own courses. When organizing various learning activities, the committee also pays attention to the appropriate amount of work, so as not to create a "burden" and affect the students' due rest during the holidays. Therefore, in terms of recreational activities, in addition to holding film screenings and small song and dance performances in conjunction with middle school youth lectures, there are also ball game competitions, ice sports, and Spring Festival celebrations at various schools to help students spend their holidays with these beneficial entertainment and sports activities.
