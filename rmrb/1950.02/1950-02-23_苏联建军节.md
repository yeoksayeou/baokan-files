Lenin and Stalin, to fight against foreign interventionists and aggressors who attempted to divide the Soviet state and deprive it of its independence, created the Soviet army, which in its thirty-two years of existence, completed the most glorious task.

February 23, 1918, when the young Red Army detachments defeated the German invaders near Pskov and Narva, was declared the birthdate of the Soviet Army. From 1918 to 1921, in a tenacious struggle against the joint forces of foreign invaders and domestic counter-revolutionaries, the Soviet Army defended the glory, freedom, and independence of its Soviet land, and defended the right of all nationalities to build their lives according to socialist principles.

For nearly twenty years, the Soviet Army defended the peaceful and constructive labor of the peoples of the Soviet Union. During this period, a socialist industry and collective farm agriculture were established in the Soviet Union, science and culture flourished, and the friendship between the various nationalities of the Soviet Union was consolidated.

The Soviet government, the Communist Party, and Stalin often saw the danger of the peace-loving Soviet Union suffering military attacks launched by imperialist aggressors. While resolutely pursuing a policy of peace, they did everything possible to organize an army capable of crushing any aggressor.

During the period of peaceful construction, focusing on developing industry, the Soviet government made fundamental changes in the technical equipment of the army, and also paid great attention to training officers. Military schools and academies, attended by the best sons of the Soviet people – workers, peasants, and intellectuals – produced many commanders with excellent training and high skills.

The central task of the Soviet government was to build a first-class army equipped with the most modern equipment, with the most experienced commanders and personnel with high moral and combat qualities.

Subsequent events proved that the Soviet people were completely correct in foreseeing armed aggression from abroad. In 1938, Japanese aggressors crossed the Soviet Union's Far Eastern border – near Lake Khasan – attempting to plunder Soviet territory. Japan suffered a disastrous defeat under the iron fist of the Soviet Army. Although, in 1939, Japanese imperialists again attempted an aggressive offensive through the Mongolian People's Republic. The Soviet Army responded by soundly defeating the elite Japanese forces.

When World War II broke out, after Fascist Germany invaded Poland, the Soviet Army marched westward to liberate the fraternal nationalities of Western Ukraine and Western Belarus from ancient servitude, in order to protect them.

In 1939-40, the Soviet armed forces displayed extraordinary skill, heroism, and fortitude in resisting the aggressive war launched by the Finnish reactionaries.

The wars against the Japanese aggressors and the Finnish White Guards showed that the Soviet Army, born of the Great October Revolution, was a loyal defender of its socialist country. Its strength lay primarily in the fact that it had been trained by the Soviet people and the Bolshevik Party, and that it had been educated to have a high spirit of sacrifice for the great ideals of socialism. This constituted its strength, and this was the source of the collective heroism of the Soviet commanders and fighters.

The Soviet Army and the Soviet people endured the most arduous test in the Great Patriotic War. On June 22, 1941, Hitler's Germany perfidiously attacked the Soviet Union, comprehensively and despicably violating the non-aggression treaty.

Under Stalin's call, the Soviet Army and the entire Soviet people heroically rose to defend their country, to defend the interests of all freedom-loving peoples of the world. The Soviet Union and its heroic army proved to be the force that shattered the Hitler war machine and tore apart its grandiose fascist plan to conquer the world.

In the first few months of the war, the Soviet Army shattered the absurd myth of the "invincibility" of the Hitler army. In the winter of 1941-42, the Soviet Army inflicted a powerful blow on the Hitler army near Rostov in the Don region and Tikhvin. In the historic battle near Moscow, the Soviet Army crushed the main force of the German army, drove out its remnants, and achieved the first large-scale victorious battle of World War II.

Taking advantage of the fact that the Second Front had not yet been opened, the German army launched another major offensive in the summer of 1942. They attacked Stalingrad, attempting to cut off Moscow's connection with the most fertile economic regions, and to encircle and occupy the capital of the Soviet Union. Under Stalin's leadership, the Soviet Army again skillfully thwarted the enemy's attack and defeated its armored bandits.

After the Battle of Stalingrad, Germany was unable to recover. From then on, the Soviet Army seized the strategic initiative and never lost it until the end of the war.

As a result of skillfully conducting large-scale counter-offensives, the Soviet Army cleared the German invaders from within the country, drove out Germany's vassal slaves – Romania, Bulgaria, Finland, and Hungary, and helped the Allied forces – Yugoslavia, Poland, and Czechoslovakia – to gain liberation from fascist enslavement.

Due to the development of the Allied offensive in Western Europe, Fascist Germany fell between two fronts held tightly in a tiger-jaw-like formation.

The Soviet Army's Battle of Berlin – which victoriously ended the war against Hitler's Germany – proved to be an unparalleled model of military science.

In the summer of 1945, the Soviet Union, faithful to the Allied treaties, declared war on imperialist Japan. The Soviet Army, which had gained rich combat experience in mobile warfare, launched heroic attacks in Manchuria, South Sakhalin Island, North Korea, and the Kuril Islands. The Soviet Army crushed the million-strong elite Japanese Kwantung Army, bringing the end of World War II to an earlier conclusion.

The military skill of the Soviet Army relied on Soviet military science. The foundation of this science was laid by the leaders of the Great October Socialist Revolution – Lenin and Stalin.

Marshal of the Soviet Union Stalin developed and enriched Soviet military science, and used it to educate marshals and generals, officers and soldiers. During the difficult years of the Great War, Stalin confidently led the Soviet Army and the entire Soviet people to victory.

The Soviet state and its army achieved a victory of world historical significance because the Soviet Army was led by the great military strategist Stalin; because the great Russian people, with their clear understanding, heroic qualities, and endurance, constituted the main driving force of the Soviet state and its army; because the Communist Party members, the backbone of the multi-ethnic Soviet Army, led it from victory to victory; because this army was supported by the entire Soviet people in the past and continues to be supported now.

The peoples of the Soviet Union have returned to peaceful construction and have achieved great success in implementing the post-war five-year plan to restore and develop the national economy. The Soviet Army, having completed its historical task in this war, is now stronger than ever.

The Soviet Army has studied and mastered the experience of World War II, they know that the Soviet Army is not formed to conquer foreign countries, but to defend the borders of the Soviet Union. The Soviet Army vigilantly defends the security of the Soviet Union. It has been, and remains, an army that defends peace and friendship between all peoples.

　　苏联建军节
    列宁和斯大林，为了向企图瓜分苏维埃国家并剥夺她的独立的外国干涉者和侵略者作斗争，创立了苏维埃军队，在它存在的三十二年中，完成了最光荣的任务。
    一九一八年二月二十三日，年青的红军各支队在普斯科夫和那尔瓦附近击溃了德国侵略者，这一天被宣布为苏维埃军队的诞生日。一九一八年——二一年，在与外国侵略者的联合军和国内的反革命者进行顽强斗争中，苏维埃军队保卫了它的苏维埃土地的光荣、自由和独立，保卫了各族人民依据社会主义原则建设他们生活的权利。
    将近有二十年，苏维埃军队保卫苏联各族人民和平和建设性的劳动。在这个时期中，一个社会主义的工业和集体农场农业在苏维埃联邦建立起来了，科学和文化繁荣了，苏维埃联邦各族人民的友谊巩固了。
    苏维埃政府、共产党和斯大林常常地看到了爱好和平的苏维埃联邦时有遭受帝国主义侵略者所发动的军事进攻的危险。在坚决地执行和平政策中，必须组织一支有能力粉碎任何侵略者的军队，在这一方面，他们曾作了一切。
    在和平建设时期，集中力量发展工业，苏维埃政府在军队的技术配备上曾作了根本的改变，同时对于训练军官也给予极大注意。苏维埃人民——工人、农民和知识分子的最优秀的儿子所参加的军校和军事学院造就了许多有优良训练和高度技巧的指挥官。
    苏维埃政府所关注的中心工作是建立一支装配有最现代化的第一等军队，它有最有经验的指挥员并且有具有高度道德和战斗品质的人员。
    此后的历次事件均说明苏维埃人民在预见来自国外的武装侵袭一点上是完全正确的。一九三八年日本侵略者越过苏维埃联邦远东边界——哈桑湖附近——企图掠夺苏联领土。日本在苏维埃军队的铁拳下遭到了惨败。虽然，一九三九年日本帝国主义者又企图经过蒙古人民共和国发动侵略进攻。苏维埃军队则以大败日军精锐部队作了回答。
    第二次世界大战爆发时，法西斯德国攻进波兰后，苏维埃军队为保护西乌克兰和西白俄罗斯的兄弟民族，西向进军从古代的奴役下解放出他们。
    一九三九——四○年，苏联武装部队在抗击芬兰反动派发动的侵略战争中，显示着非凡的技能、英雄主义和刚毅。
    反对日本侵略者和芬兰白卫军的战争，说明了诞生于伟大十月革命的苏维埃军队是它的社会主义国家的忠诚保卫者。它的力量主要在于它曾为苏维埃人民和布尔塞维克党所训练，在于它曾被教育而具有对社会主义伟大理想高度牺牲的精神。这个构成了它的力量，这就是苏维埃指战员的集体英雄主义的源泉。
    苏维埃军队和苏维埃人民在伟大的卫国战争中经受了最艰苦的考验。一九四一年六月二十二日，希特勒德国背信弃义地攻击苏维埃联邦，全面地和卑鄙地违犯了互不侵犯条约。
    在斯大林号召之下，苏维埃军队和全苏人民英勇地起来保卫他们的国家、保卫世界爱好自由的各族人民的利益。苏联和它的英勇的军队证明是粉碎希特勒战争机器和撕碎其巨大征服世界法西斯计划的力量。
    在战争的头几个月里，苏维埃军队击碎了希特勒军队“无敌”的荒诞神话。一九四一——四二年冬天在顿河区罗斯托夫和齐赫汶附近苏军给予希特勒军队以有力打击。在莫斯科近郊的历史性战斗中苏维埃军队粉碎了德军的主力，驱逐了它的残余并且获得第二次大战中第一个大规模的胜利战斗。
    德军利用第二战场尚未开辟的便宜，于一九四二年夏季发动了另一个大攻势。他们进攻斯大林格勒妄图割断莫斯科与最丰饶经济区域的连系，包围和占领苏维埃联邦的首都。在斯大林的领导下，苏维埃军队再次巧妙地挫败敌人的攻击和打败了它的装甲匪徒。
    斯大林格勒大战后德国已不能复原。自此苏维埃军队掌握了战略的主动。同时直到战争结束的时候永没有再失去它。
    巧妙地从事大规模的反攻的结果，苏维埃军队在国土以内肃清了德国侵略者，驱逐了德国的附庸奴仆——罗马尼亚、保加利亚、芬兰和匈牙利，同时帮助盟军——南斯拉夫、波兰和捷克斯洛伐克——从法西斯奴役下获得解放。
    由于盟军在西欧攻势的发展，法西斯德国陷于形似虎头钳紧握的两个战线之间。
    苏维埃军队的柏林之战——他胜利地结束了对希特勒德国的战争——证明是军事科学的一个无比模范。
    一九四五年夏天，苏联忠实于同盟国条约，对帝国主义日本宣战。在机动战争中曾获得丰富战斗经验的苏维埃军队在满洲、南库页岛、北朝鲜和千岛群岛进行英勇的攻击。苏联军队击溃了百万日本关东军精锐，使第二次世界大战的结束早日降临。
    苏维埃军队的军事技巧依靠于苏维埃的军事科学。这个科学的基础为伟大的十月社会主义革命领导者——列宁和斯大林所奠定。
    苏联大元帅斯大林曾发展和丰富了苏维埃军事科学。并以此教育了元帅和将军、军官和战士。在大战的艰难的岁月中，斯大林有信心地领导着苏维埃军队和全苏人民走向胜利。
    苏维埃国家和它的军队所以获致具有世界历史意义的胜利，是因为苏维埃军队为伟大的军事家斯大林所领导；是因为具有明确认识，英勇的品质和忍耐力的伟大俄国人民构成了苏维埃国家和它的军队的主要动力；因为共产党战斗人员，多民族的苏维埃军队的基干领导着它从胜利走向胜利；是因为这个军队为全苏人民在过去曾支持并且现在仍在支持着。
    苏维埃联邦的各族人民已回到和平的建设并且在执行恢复和发展国民经济的战后五年计划中已获得了巨大的成就。苏联军队，在此次战争中完成了它的历史任务，并且它现在已比任何时候更壮大。
    苏维埃军队研究了并且掌握了第二次世界大战的经验，他们知道：苏军组成并不是为征服外国，而是为了保卫苏联的边疆。苏维埃军队警惕地保卫着苏维埃联邦的安全。它曾经是、现在依然是保卫和平和各国人民间的友谊的军队。
