　　Liaoxi Winter School Combines with Production
    Teaching the People by the People Solves the Teacher Shortage; Students Emphasize Writing More to Help Memorization.
    [From Our Newspaper] In the vast rural areas of Liaoxi Province, Northeast China, the Winter School movement has been widely launched. According to a survey and statistics at the end of December last year, there are already 8,408 formal Winter Schools and 7,908 Winter School groups in the rural areas and suburbs of 21 counties and three cities (excluding the suburbs of Fuxin City) throughout the province, with 552,170 students. According to statistics from 21 counties and cities, there are a total of 8,486 Winter School teachers, most of whom are democratically elected Winter School teachers who have received training.
    There are three main reasons why the Winter School in this province can become a large-scale mass learning movement: First, it is closely integrated with the current central task—winter sideline production. When mobilizing the masses to attend Winter School, all localities paid attention to publicizing that Winter School does not hinder sideline production and can be closely integrated with it. After the Winter School started, the slogan "Attend Winter School, don't delay work" was put forward. A female cadre in Liujiazi, Zhangwu County, took the lead in attending Winter School, which did not delay her daily production work, and she also recognized more than 200 characters, which influenced many people, who also followed her to Winter School. In Dahe Village, Changbei County, students in the Winter School formed groups to set up sideline production plans, and each group signed contracts with the village cooperative. In Sijiazi, Changtu County, they exchanged seed selection experiences in the Winter School and developed new methods for picking beans. The Winter School in Zhangxiangtun, Kaiyuan County, took some time to give lectures on sideline production, combining the study group and the sideline production group. The specific method was: The Winter School mobilized students to take the lead in production within the sideline group, and in the process of production, mobilized young and middle-aged people who had not attended Winter School within the sideline group to attend Winter School. In this way, production was not delayed, and the masses' cultural learning requirements were met. The masses' learning enthusiasm is very high. Second, the method of "teaching the people by the people" was used to solve the problem of teachers. According to statistics from 16 counties and cities, there are 3,838 democratically elected teachers, all of whom have undergone short-term training. All localities have also paid attention to strengthening the regular assistance of rural primary school teachers to democratically elected teachers. In order to more broadly mobilize the strength of the masses to engage in Winter School teaching, the province plans to widely mobilize middle school students, primary school teachers, and senior primary school students to participate in Winter School work during the winter vacation. The fact that the teacher problem can be solved from among the masses guarantees the development of the Winter School work. Third, the teaching methods pay attention to the characteristics of the peasant masses. For example, teaching new characters pays attention to connecting with the lives of farmers, so that the characters taught can be used in the farmhouse. When teaching characters, in view of the weak memory of farmers, it is emphasized that students should write them several times. The Winter School in Zhangxiangtun, Kaiyuan County, proposed "Seeing it a thousand times with your eyes is not as good as doing it once with your hands," and writing more can help students memorize new characters. At the same time, Winter Schools in various places have paid attention to extracurricular exercises and in-class reviews, and created a method of mutual questioning by groups, so that students will not forget what they have learned, in order to improve and consolidate students' learning enthusiasm. Using the above methods, students in various places generally learn three to five characters per person per day. For example, in Changbei County, each person has recognized an average of 120 characters in 40 days.

　　辽西冬学结合生产
    以民教民，解决师资困难；学生字着重多写，帮助记忆。
    【本报讯】东北辽西省广大农村，冬学运动已普遍展开。据去年十二月末调查统计，全省二十一县三市（阜新市无郊区除外）的农村及郊区，已有正式冬学八千四百零八处，冬学小组七千九百零八组，学员五十五万二千一百七十人。冬学教师人数，据二十一个县市统计，共有八千四百八十六人，其中大部分为受过训的民选冬学教师。
    该省冬学所以能够成为大规模的群众学习运动，主要原因有三：一、与当前中心工作——冬季副业生产紧密结合。各地在动员群众上冬学时，即注意宣传冬学与副业生产互不妨碍，并可紧密结合进行。冬学开始后，即提出“上冬学，不误活”的口号。彰武县六家子一位妇女干部带头上冬学，没耽误日常生产工作，又认得了二百多字，影响了许多人，也跟着上了冬学。昌北县大和村，冬学里，学员分组订了副业生产计划，各组都和村合作社订了合同。昌图县四家子，在冬学里交流选种经验，研究出了新的挑豆方法。开原县张相屯的冬学，抽出一定时间，讲副业生产课，使学习小组和副业生产小组结合起来，具体办法是：冬学动员学员在副业小组内带头搞生产，在搞生产中，动员副业小组内未上冬学的青壮年来上冬学。这样，既不误生产，又满足了群众文化学习的要求。群众的学习情绪很高。二、用“以民教民”的办法，解决了教员问题。据十六个县、市的统计，民选教员三千八百三十八人，这些教员都经过了短期训练。各地并注意了加强农村小学教员对民选教员的经常帮助。为了更广泛地发动群众力量来从事冬学教学，该省拟于寒假期间，广泛动员中学生、小学教员、高小学生参加冬学工作。教员问题能从群众当中去求得解决，冬学工作的开展便有了保证。三、教学方法注意到农民群众的特点。如教生字注意联系农民的生活，使教了的字庄稼院能用上。教字时，针对农民记忆力较弱的特点，强调学员多写几遍。开原县张相屯冬学提出“眼过千遭，不如手过一遭”，多写可帮助学员对生字的记忆。同时，各地冬学都注意了课外练习和课内复习，并创造了以小组为单位互相提问的办法，使学员学了的东西不会忘记，以提高并巩固学员的学习情绪。用了以上这些办法，各地学员一般的每人每天可学字三个到五个，如昌北县四十天中，平均每人已认识了一百二十字。
