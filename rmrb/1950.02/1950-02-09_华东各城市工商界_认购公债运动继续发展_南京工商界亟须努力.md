The movement for industrial and commercial circles in various cities of East China to subscribe to public bonds has continued to rise after major cities such as Zhangjiakou, Hangzhou, Fuzhou, and Xi'an overfulfilled their tasks. Industrial and commercial circles in various places have established promotion branches, expressing their determination to complete their tasks. Since January 29, Shanghai has fully launched public bond promotion publicity, with colorful posters and slogans pasted all over the city's streets, shops, windows, factories, schools, and households. Large balloons are rising slowly, soaring into the air. The sound of gongs and drums resounds throughout the city, and the call to buy public bonds is heard everywhere. Since the financial industry took the lead in subscribing to more than 2 million shares on January 27, various industries in the city have been catching up. The Public Bond Purchase Branch convened a mobilization meeting on the 30th with representatives from 92 industries including refining industry, private shipping industry, watch industry, leather industry, and hotel industry to promote subscription. The cotton textile industry promotion branch also held its first committee meeting on the afternoon of the same day; more than 30 committee members including Zhang Xichang and Rong Erren put forward a subscription target of 2.1 million shares on the spot. It was immediately supported by the industry, and the factories that had already subscribed increased their subscriptions; the Shenxin factories alone increased their subscriptions by 230,000 shares, totaling 514,000 shares newly subscribed and increased on the same day. By February 1, the factories continued to increase their subscriptions by more than 230,000 shares. Together with the previous subscription of 753,500 shares, it has exceeded 1.5 million shares. Currently, other factories are continuing to subscribe, and it is expected that the above target will be completed in the short term, competing with the financial industry. As for the cement industry, the task of purchasing bonds has now been gloriously completed. Other industrial and commercial sectors are also stepping up their subscriptions.济南市工商界至上月底即已完成九十万分的认购公债任务，现正向十二万分的超额任务努力。济南市工商界 completed the task of subscribing to 900,000 shares of public bonds by the end of last month, and is now working towards an excess task of 120,000 shares. Factories, schools, institutions, and troops are also actively subscribing. By February 4, more than 1,215,000 shares have been over-completed. The Nanjing Municipal Promotion Committee's industrial and commercial sector branch has been actively cooperating with the Municipal Promotion Committee to hold an expanded publicity week to mobilize subscriptions since its official establishment on January 23. The city's assigned task was originally 350,000 shares, but by the end of last month, industrial and commercial people in the city had only subscribed for more than 40,000 shares in the city's total promotion amount; on the contrary, factories, troops, institutions, and schools have enthusiastically purchased more than 100,000 shares, exceeding the assigned task. Industrial and commercial promotion branches in Taicang, Nantong, Zhenjiang, Suzhou, Wuxi and other places were also established successively since January 23. At the inaugural meetings, representatives from various industries expressed their determination to complete the subscription task in the short term. Among them, Taicang County's allocated amount of 70,000 shares, all subscribed by the industrial and commercial circles, over-fulfilling the task is a foregone conclusion. When the Nantong industrial and commercial circles held the inaugural meeting of the promotion branch on January 24, various industries enthusiastically subscribed, reaching more than 80,000 shares. Since the Changzhou industrial and commercial circles established a promotion branch on January 12, various industries have started subscribing on the 22nd. By the end of the month, 13 industries in the industrial sector had subscribed for more than 174,000 shares; 86 industries in the commercial sector had subscribed for more than 236,000 shares, exceeding the original assigned subscription task of 400,000 shares. Employees, teachers, students, women, etc. in the city have also exceeded the original task of 50,000 shares. A total of 1.2 million shares of public bonds were allocated in various parts of northern Anhui. The specific distribution and promotion figures were determined by the commissioners and mayors of each special zone after research and discussion: Bengbu City 360,000 shares, Hefei City 65,000 shares, Fuyang Special Zone 200,000 shares, Suxian Special Zone 50,000 shares, Chuxian Special Zone 85,000 shares, Chaohu Special Zone 125,000 shares, Liuan Special Zone 130,000 shares, Anqing Special Zone 125,000 shares, Huainan Mining Area 60,000 shares. Among them, Hefei City's subscription reached more than half by the end of last month. The Huainan Mining Area basically completed the subscription task by January 30. The enterprise sector alone subscribed for more than 57,000 shares, and other employees, teachers, housewives, etc. are continuing to subscribe.
