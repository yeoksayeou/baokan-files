Science Applied to Conquer Nature
Soviet Scientists Researching Transformation of Deserts and Swamps, Discovering New Important Mineral Deposits Like Coal and Iron

Academic Secretary Topchiev reported: Last year, the Institutes of Physics and Mathematics of the Academy of Sciences published more than 500 special papers and scientific articles. Astronomers investigated the center of the galaxy, discovered new star clusters, and solved the problems of the physical and chemical composition of celestial bodies. Soviet seismologists created new methods for predicting earthquakes. In several regions of Central Asia, for the first time in world history, they established soil research stations to study phenomena preceding earthquakes. Currently, with the help of specialized equipment, they can record even the slightest tremors that were previously difficult to detect. Last year, Soviet chemists proposed more than 20 improved works that can be applied in industry. Scientists from the Department of Geology and Geography of the Academy of Sciences have published 435 scientific papers and discovered new iron ore deposits, coal, and other valuable mineral resources. Scientists have produced charts on transforming the deserts of Central Asia and Kazakhstan, and completed the research work on the swampy areas of the Barabinsk Lowland in Western Siberia, which was started five years ago by survey teams, and created new methods for improving swampy areas and wetlands. Scientists from the Department of Technology of the Academy of Sciences have published nearly 700 scientific papers. Most of the research work concerns the most efficient use of energy and fuel. Last year, Soviet biologists solved 55 scientific problems and conducted 20 large-scale expeditions. Among the most significant achievements of the humanities institutes of the Academy of Sciences are the publication of the complete works of Pushkin, Kishelev's monograph "Ancient History of Southern Siberia," the excavation of the 3rd-century Khorezm palace, and the excavation of ancient burial mounds in the mountainous Altai region.

In 1949, the Academy of Sciences published 843 books, an increase of 11.5 percent over 1948. The libraries of the Academy of Sciences added 490,000 new books. The Soviet Academy of Sciences has become the most advanced scientific center. In 1949, many foreign delegations of scientists and cultural workers visited the Soviet Academy of Sciences, including representatives from the People's Republic of China, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Romania, and the German Democratic Republic, all of whom were willing to adopt the advanced experience of the Soviet Academy of Sciences in organizing and planning scientific activities.

　　科学应用于征服自然
    苏科学家正研究改变沙漠沼泽并发现了新的煤铁等重要矿藏
    科学院秘书托普契夫报告称：去年，科学院物理学及数学研究所发表了五百余篇专题论文及科学论文。天文学家调查了星河中心，发现了新的星群并解决了星体的物理与化学成分的问题。苏联地震学家创造了预测地震发生的新方法。他们在中央亚细亚若干地区中，在世界历史上第一次成立了土壤学研究站，研究地震发生前的现象。目前，在专门器械的帮助下，他们已可能把从前难以测知的轻微地震记录下来。苏联化学家在去年提出了二十多种可以应用于工业中的完善的作品。科学院地质——地理学部的科学家们，已发表了四百三十五篇科学论文，并发现了新的铁矿苗、煤及其他贵重矿物的蕴藏。科学家制出了关于改变中亚细亚及哈萨克斯坦沙漠的图表，而且完成了五年前由勘测队开始的西伯利亚西部巴拉宾斯克低地的沼泽地带的研究工作，并创造了改良沼泽地带和低湿地带的新方法。科学院工艺部的科学家们，已发表了将近七百篇科学论文。研究工作大部是关于能学及燃料的最有效的利用。苏联生物学家去年已解决了五十五个科学上的问题，且进行了二十次大规模的考察工作。在科学院人文研究所的最重大的成就中，是出版了普希金全集、基舍列夫的专著“南西伯利亚古代史”，和第三世纪贺列兹姆王宫的发掘及山峦起伏的阿尔泰古塚的发掘。
    一九四九年科学院出版了八百四十三种书籍，较一九四八年增加百分之十一点五。科学院各图书馆，新添了四十九万册书。苏联科学院已成为最先进的科学中心。一九四九年许多外国科学与文化工作者代表团访问了苏联科学院，其中有中华人民共和国、波兰、捷克斯洛伐克、罗马尼亚及德意志民主共和国的代表，他们都愿意采用苏联科学院在组织与计划科学活动方面的先进经验。
