Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 10th. U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Butterworth, another person responsible for the Far East aggression policy of the US imperialism, said in Manila on the 7th of this month: the US diplomatic personnel conference scheduled to be held in Bangkok on the 13th of this month "will discuss the proposed possible alliance of countries in the Asian and Pacific region." Butterworth flew from the United States to Tokyo on January 3 to co-host the diplomatic personnel conference with Yasep in Bangkok, which aims to formulate the overall US aggression policy in Southeast Asia. During his stay in Tokyo, Butterworth held secret meetings with senior officials of MacArthur's headquarters and MacArthur himself, respectively, to hear their opinions on the US aggression plan in Southeast Asia, so as to bring their opinions to the Bangkok conference.

On the 7th, after arriving in Manila, Butterworth began to hold talks with the leaders of the Philippine Senate and House of Representatives and the Philippine Vice President Lopez, and on the 8th, he held a long meeting with the Philippine Acting Foreign Minister Neri. According to Agence France-Presse, the content of the talks was "to discuss making the Philippines the anchor of the US defense strategy in the Far East," and at the same time, to make "the Philippines the first test product of the Fourth Point Plan." United Press quoted Neri as saying that the content of his talks with Butterworth can be mainly divided into two points: (1) the Southeast Asia League proposed by the Philippines, and (2) Truman's "Fourth Point Plan" (referring to Truman's plan proposed in January last year to carry out economic aggression in the name of assisting backward countries). Neri also revealed that Butterworth had stated that the United States was "very interested" in this alliance and "willing to support it." Butterworth's activities show that US imperialism is actively directing the reactionaries of Southeast Asian countries and using the so-called "Fourth Point Plan" as bait to form a so-called "Southeast Asia League" against the people of Southeast Asia, especially the Chinese people.

　　美帝助理国务卿白德华
    叫嚣组织“东南亚联盟”   
    在日菲进行活动策划侵略
    【新华社北京十日电】美国国务院另一负责远东侵略政策的助理国务卿白德华本月七日在马尼拉说：定于本月十三日在曼谷举行的美国外交人员会议，“将讨论亚洲及太平洋区域各国所拟议的可能的联盟问题”。白德华系于一月三日自美飞抵东京，前往曼谷与耶塞普共同主持旨在拟订美国在东南亚全盘侵略政策的外交人员会议。白德华在东京期间，曾分别与麦克阿瑟总部高级官员及麦克阿瑟本人举行了秘密会议，听取他们对美国在东南亚进行侵略计划的意见，以便把他们的意见，带到曼谷会议中去。
    七日，白德华在飞抵马尼拉后，即开始与菲参众两院首领及菲副总统罗皮兹等进行会谈，并于八日与菲代理外长尼利举行长时间的会谈。据法新社报道：会谈内容是“讨论使菲律宾成为美国在远东的防务战略的锚”，同时使“菲律宾成为第四点计划的第一个试验品”。合众社引尼利的谈话称，他和白德华会谈的内容，主要可分为两点：（一）菲律宾所提议的东南亚联盟，（二）杜鲁门的“第四点计划”（按即杜鲁门于去年一月提出以援助落后国家为名而行经济侵略之实的计划）。尼利并透露，白德华曾表示美国对于这一联盟“至感兴趣”，“愿予以支持”。白德华的活动说明，美帝国主义正积极指使东南亚各国反动派，并以所谓“第四点计划”作为钓饵，组成一个反对东南亚人民，特别是中国人民的所谓“东南亚联盟”。
