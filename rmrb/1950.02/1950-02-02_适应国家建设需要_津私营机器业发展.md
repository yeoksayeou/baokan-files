Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, January 29th: Tianjin's private machinery industry is gradually developing. As of the end of October last year, there were 445 machinery factories in the city, an increase of 82 compared to before liberation; there were 4,274 machines of various types, an increase of 2,240 compared to before liberation; and there were 6,074 employees, an increase of 1,538 compared to before liberation. The fastest growing sectors are the manufacturing of machinery for flour, rubber, and oil extraction. The city's 110 larger machinery factories produced 857 flour milling machines last year, an increase of 67 percent compared to 1948; and 49 rubber machines of various types, an increase of 69 percent. Taking the Zhonghua Industrial Cooperative as an example, when it started operations in 1948, it had only six workers and its business was to repair and supply machine parts for factories in the city. Now the number of workers has increased to 33, and they are rushing to produce oil extraction machines ordered by Zhengzhou, Chahar, Datong and other places.

The reasons for the development of Tianjin's private machinery industry are: increasingly smooth transportation, the vast market opened up by the construction projects that are beginning in various places, and especially the support of the national economy. For example, the state-owned North China Machinery Company organized more than 120 private machinery factories last August to undertake the production of 440,000 sets of porcelain insulator screws for the Ministry of Railways. The company also sent engineers and inspectors to various factories to guide technology and inspect finished products, ensuring the smooth completion of production. During this production, five factories that had originally ceased operations resumed operations.

Currently, Tianjin's private machinery industry is preparing to organize a collective material procurement committee to purchase raw materials in an organized manner to reduce costs. Flour milling machine manufacturing factories are planning to jointly study the use of small generators to compensate for the shortage of electricity.

　　适应国家建设需要  津私营机器业发展
    【新华社天津二十九日电】天津市私营机器工业正逐渐发展中。截至去年十月底止，全市机器工厂共有四百四十五家，较解放前增加八十二家；各种机器共有四千二百七十四台，较解放前增加二千二百四十台；职工为六千零七十四人，较解放前增加一千五百三十八人。其中发展最快的是面粉、橡胶及榨油等机器制造业。全市较大的机器工厂一百一十家，去年共产各种面粉机八百五十七台，较一九四八年增加百分之六十七；产各种橡胶机四十九台，增加了百分之六十九。以中华工业社为例，一九四八年开工时只有六个工人，业务是给本市厂修配机件。现在工人已增至三十三人，正赶制郑州、察哈尔、大同等地订购的榨油机器。
    津市私营机器工业发展的原因是：交通日益畅通，各地正在开始的建设事业为该业开辟了广大的市场，特别是国家经济的扶助。如国营华北机器公司，去年八月曾组织一百二十余家私营机器工厂，承做铁道部的四十四万套磁瓶螺丝。该公司并派工程师、检验人员至各厂指导技术与检验成品，使生产顺利完成。在此次生产中有五家原来停工的工厂复了业。
    目前津市私营机器工业正准备组织集体购料委员会，有组织地采购原料，以减低成本。面粉机制造工厂，正计划共同研究采用小型发电机以补电力的不足。
