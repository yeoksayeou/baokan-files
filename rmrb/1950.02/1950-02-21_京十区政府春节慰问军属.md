　　Jing Ten District Government Extends Spring Festival Greetings to Military Dependents
    [This Newspaper] The cadres of the Jing Ten District Government, the District Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, the District Federation of Trade Unions, the Public Security Bureau and other organs formed groups on the 17th and went to the homes of martyrs, soldiers, and cadre dependents to pay New Year's greetings and express their regards. The military dependents were extremely excited. Old Mrs. Zhang, a military dependent at 2 Yuqingguan, happily said, "I was planning to go to the District Head to pay a New Year's visit first, but you have come first." She also said, "Comrades, don't think I'm old, but I am willing to work. I don't want to rest even during the New Year. Military dependents should not rely on the government for their livelihoods. Only through labor and production can we fundamentally solve our livelihood problems." The local masses also said, "Military dependents are truly glorious, the District Head and the cadres all come to pay New Year's greetings!"
    Also, on the 19th, the district invited all military dependents to see a film, and everyone was extremely happy. (Wang Xi)

　　京十区政府春节慰问军属
    【本报讯】京十区区政府、中共区委会、区工会、公安局等机关干部于十七日组成小组，分别到烈、军、干家属处去拜年慰问。军属们异常兴奋。玉清观二号军属张老太太高兴的说：“我准备先给区长去拜年，你们倒先来了。”又说：“同志们别看我老了，但我肯劳动，我过年也不愿休息。军属不应依靠政府生活，只有劳动生产才能根本解决生活呢。”当地群众也说：“军人家属真光荣，区长和干部都来拜年！”
    又，十九日该区招待全区军属看影剧，大家异常快活。（王晞）
