Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, February 26th: US imperialism is planning to strengthen espionage and sabotage activities against our country. According to a United Press dispatch from Washington on the 24th, the US State Department is establishing three more intelligence agencies. The dispatch also quoted McConaughy, Special Assistant to the Secretary of State in charge of Far Eastern Affairs, as saying: "Obviously, we cannot forget China with its 450 million people. In order to obtain reliable intelligence, upon which to base our estimates and policies, this problem will be doubly burdensome because we no longer have embassies and consulates inside China." Another United Press dispatch from Washington stated: Walter Butterworth, Assistant Secretary of State for Far Eastern Affairs, said to the House Appropriations Committee on the 23rd that the State Department's 129 personnel in China would be reassigned to "posts around China." He also said: "We are about to use research and other indirect sources to obtain news about China, and what needs to be done in the future is to strengthen all posts in countries bordering China." The words of Butterworth and McConaughy not only reveal that the US State Department is anxious to continue its espionage and sabotage activities against our country, but also once again confirm that one of the main tasks of the former US embassies and consulates in China was to steal our country's state secrets through espionage.

　　美帝图增设间谍机关加强对我国破坏活动
    【新华社北京二十六日电】美国国务院正计划加强对我国进行间谍工作与破坏活动。据合众社华盛顿二十四日电透露，美国国务院正在增设三处谍报机关。该电并引国务院负责远东事务的特别助理麦谦特的话说：“显然，我们不能忘掉有四亿五千万人民的中国。为了获得可靠情报，根据这些情报作为我们的估计和政策的基础，这一问题将加倍繁重，因为我们在中国国内不再有使领机关了”。又据合众社华盛顿讯：美负责远东事务之助理国务卿白德华二十三日在众院拨款委员会中说：国务院在中国的一百二十九名职员将改派到“中国周围的岗位上”。他又说：“我们即将用研究与其他间接来源，来取得关于中国的消息，将来所需要做的事是加强与中国接壤的各国中的一切岗位”。白德华和麦谦特的话，不但泄露美国国务院正急于继续进行对我国的间谍破坏活动，而且又一次证实前驻华美使领馆主要任务之一是窃取我国国家机密的特务工作。
