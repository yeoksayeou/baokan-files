Xinhua News Agency, Changsha, 4th – According to a report by Dr. Tan Xuehua, Dean of Huade Hospital in Changde, Hunan, Japanese war criminals used airplanes to spread plague bacteria during the war of aggression against China, killing Chinese people. On November 4, 1941, a Japanese plane dropped a large amount of grains and wheat in the urban area of Changde. At that time, the air defense headquarters, the police bureau, and the town office collected these grains and sent them to Huade Hospital for examination. Dean Tan Xuehua immediately used these grains and wheat, suspended in sterile saline solution. After sedimentation, he took the sediment, made a smear, and stained it using Gram's staining method. Under a microscope, he discovered that these grains contained numerous Gram-positive bacilli and a few bipolar staining bacilli. Based on the results of this preliminary examination, Tan Xuehua suspected that the Japanese plane had spread plague bacteria and conducted a second examination. He compared the grains dropped by the Japanese plane with ordinary grains obtained from a miscellaneous grain shop. After the same cultivation, he found that the sediment from the grains dropped by the Japanese plane contained, in addition to numerous Gram-positive bacilli, also a few Gram-negative bipolar staining bacilli. The discovery of these Gram-negative bipolar staining bacilli further convinced Tan Xuehua that the Japanese plane was spreading plague bacteria.

Eight days after the Japanese plane dropped the grains, on November 12, the first suspected plague patient in the urban area of Changde was discovered. A person named Cai Tao'er sought treatment at Huade Hospital but died within thirty-six hours of admission. The symptoms resembled those of the plague. At that time, the Red Cross had dispatched a rescue team to the Changde area to carry out rescue work. The team leader, Dr. Kant (or Kent), together with Tan Xuehua, dissected the body of the suspected plague patient. They found that the deceased's liver, gallbladder, spleen, kidneys, and other organs were swollen. When blood was drawn from the spleen for examination, numerous bipolar staining bacilli were found, identical to those found in the venous blood. Subsequently, they cultured the bacteria from the spleen blood and found that all the bipolar staining bacilli were Gram-negative, proving that these bacteria were indeed plague bacilli. The above examination results were confirmed as plague bacilli by Dr. Lü Jingxuan of Xiangya Hospital in Changsha and Chen Wengui, Director of the Bacteriology Department of the Red Cross, after successive examinations and identifications. At that time, after the first plague patient was discovered in the urban area of Changde, many patients with plague were continuously discovered and died within a short period of time. Plague bacilli were also found in the corpses of these deceased, proving that the grains and other items dropped by the Japanese plane were indeed intended to spread plague bacteria and poison the Chinese people. The local people unanimously support the judgment of the Military Tribunal of the Primorsky Krai Military District of the Soviet Union against the Japanese war criminals who masterminded the bacteriological warfare; and believe that the Japanese war criminals who invaded China must be severely punished in order to pay for the countless blood debts they owe to the Chinese people.

　　湖南常德华德医院院长证明
    日寇曾用飞机散布鼠疫
    常德地区很多同胞因此死亡
    【新华社长沙四日电】据湖南常德华德医院院长谭学华医学博士报告，日本战犯曾在侵略中国的战争中使用飞机散布鼠疫病菌杀害中国人民。一九四一年十一月四日日机一架在常德城区投下谷麦等物很多。当时防空指挥部、警察局和镇公所等机关曾收集这些谷物，送请华德医院检验。该院院长谭学华即用这种谷麦放在无菌生理盐水中沉淀，再取其沉淀作涂抹片用革兰氏的染色法染色后，在显微镜下发现这些谷麦内有多数的革兰氏“阳性杆菌”和少数“两极着色杆菌”。根据这种初步检验的结果，谭学华怀疑日机散布的是鼠疫病菌，乃作第二次检验，将日机投下的谷麦和杂粮行取来的普通谷麦作比较检验，经过同样的培养，又发现日机投下的谷麦沉淀中除有多数革兰氏“阳性杆菌”外，并有少数革兰氏“阴性两极着色杆菌”，这次“阴性两极着色杆菌”的发现，更使谭学华认定日机所散布的是鼠疫病菌。在日机投谷麦八天以后，即十一月十二日，常德城区发现第一个鼠疫嫌疑病人，名蔡桃儿者，入华德医院就诊，但在入院三十六小时以后即不治死亡，其症状与鼠疫病症类似。当时，红十字会已派救护队到常德区进行救治工作，该队队长坎特（或译肯德）医师即会同谭学华将这个鼠疫嫌疑病死者的尸体解剖，发现死者的肝脏、胆囊、脾脏、肾脏等都肿大，当将其脾脏内血液抽出检验，又发现有多数“两极着色杆菌”，与其静脉血内所发现的完全相同。其后，他们再将脾脏血液中的细菌加以培养，则发现所有“两极着色杆菌”都为革兰氏阴性，证明这些细菌实即鼠疫杆菌。以上检验结果，经长沙湘雅医院医师吕静轩和红十字会细菌学系主任陈文贵等先后检验鉴定，都确认为鼠疫杆菌。当时常德城区自发现第一个患鼠疫的病人以后，连续发现患鼠疫的病人很多，都在短时间内不治死亡。从这些死者的尸体中，也同样发现鼠疫杆菌，证明日机投下的谷麦等物，确系为了散布鼠疫病菌，毒杀中国人民。当地人民一致拥护苏联滨海军区军事法庭对主谋细菌战的日本战犯的审判；并认为侵略中国的日本战犯们必须受到严厉惩罚，以偿付他们对于中国人民所负的无数血债。
