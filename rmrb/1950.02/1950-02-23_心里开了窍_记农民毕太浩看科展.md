　　The Light Bulb Went On
　　—An Account of Farmer Bi Taihao Visiting the Science Exhibition
　　Kezhan Xuanchuanzu
　　On the third day of the Lunar New Year, Old Mrs. Bi, who lives in Dazhong Temple outside Xizhimen, went to the city with her son, Bi Taihao, to see the Science Knowledge Exhibition. In the trolley, the old lady asked her son, "Why are you carrying such a large ledger?" He smiled and said, "I heard this exhibition is very good. I brought a notebook to take notes, so it will be convenient to look up when I need it."
　　It turns out that although Bi Taihao has been working in the fields for many years, working hard for half his life, and his back is hunched, he can still recognize many characters and write ordinary letters.
　　Around noon, the Bi family arrived outside Hepingmen. They lined up at the entrance of the exhibition, and after waiting all afternoon, the exhibition closed before they could get in. The next morning, Bi Taihao helped his old mother to the venue gate at eight o'clock to queue up!
　　In the exhibition hall, Bi Taihao held his large notebook, listening and taking notes, asking questions when he didn't understand. He wrote in his book: Children should be injected with BCG, smallpox vaccine, typhoid fever vaccine... preventive injections to prevent infectious diseases. He also asked the guide, "If a child has a cough with phlegm in winter, is it okay to get a pertussis vaccine?" His questions were about connecting actual events with what he saw. When he saw the chart "Babies should be fed on time," he said to Old Mrs. Bi, "No wonder our child spits up milk after feeding! His mother puts the nipple in his mouth as soon as she hears him cry, even when he's not hungry, of course he'll spit up!" The guide then explained: Children don't just cry when they are hungry, they will also cry if they are not sleeping comfortably, if they have wet themselves, or if they hear loud noises... Bi Taihao felt that the explanations in each department were reasonable and detailed, and he said with emotion, "I've lived almost half my life, and this is the first time I've seen so many new things. Today, it's like a light bulb went on in my head, and I can understand everything!" He saw a painting of an old woman burning incense and kowtowing, praying to the Buddha for her sick child to be blessed. He cracked his thick lips and smiled honestly, saying, "It's useless to burn incense if you don't see a doctor." He told his mother what he understood at any time. Sometimes, Old Mrs. Bi didn't pay attention and walked too fast, so he would pull his mother back and say, "Mom! Mom! Come and see this. We haven't seen this yet! Walk slowly, if you walk too fast you won't understand anything." Bi Taihao was unwilling to miss a single title or picture. He noted down the explanation of all the questions in his notebook. He was most happy about the nutritious foods, most of which were grown in their fields. He wrote down the ingredients, proportions, and manufacturing methods, planning to make them for his own children.

　　心里开了窍
　　——记农民毕太浩看科展
　　科展宣传组
    大年初三，住在西直门外大钟寺的毕老太太，同儿子毕太浩进城来看科学知识展览会。在电车里，老太太问儿子：“你挟着个大帐本出来干吗？”他笑着说：“听说这展览挺好。我带上本子记记，用的时候查查也方便。”
    原来，毕太浩虽是长年下地干活，辛辛苦苦了半辈子，背都驼了。却还能认不少字，会写个普通信。
    晌午头，毕家母子到了和平门外，在展览会门口挨着个儿排队，等了一个下午，还没捞着看就闭幕了。第二天早晨，毕太浩扶着老母亲八点钟就来会场门口排队啦！
    在展览室里，毕太浩托着大本子，一边听一边记，看不明白就问。他本儿上写着：小孩要注射卡介苗、牛痘、伤寒、……预防针，以防得传染病。他还问解说员：“小孩冬天咳嗽有痰，打百日咳预防针行吗？”他的问题就是把实际发生的事和所看的都连系在一块儿来想。当他看到“婴儿吃奶应按时”的挂图时，他和毕老太太说：“怪不得咱家孩子吃完奶就吐奶呢！他妈一听孩子哭就把奶头塞到嘴里去，不饿也吃，那还不吐！”解说员听了就解释道：孩子不只是饿才哭，睡得不舒服，尿湿了，听到大声响……他都会哭。毕太浩就觉得每个部门解说的都有道理，而且仔细，他感动的说：“活了快半辈子啦，这是第一次，见识这么多新东西。今天就像心里开了窍一样，什么都能明白啦！”他看到了一幅老婆婆烧香磕头，为了娃娃生病，求佛爷保佑的画，裂开厚嘴唇，朴实的笑了笑，说：“不找医生，烧香也白搭。”他随时把看懂的讲给母亲听，有时毕老太太不注意，走快了，他就拉住母亲说：“妈！妈！您来看这个。这个还没看呢！慢慢走，走快了什么也不懂。”毕太浩是不肯放过一个标题和一幅画。所有问题的解说他都扼要地记在本子上。他最高兴的是那些富有营养的食品，差不多都是他们地里出的。他把配合份量、制造方法都记下来了，准备照样儿弄给自己的孩子吃。
