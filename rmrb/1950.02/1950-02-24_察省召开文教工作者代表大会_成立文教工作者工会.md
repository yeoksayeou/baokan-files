　　Chahar Province Convenes Representative Conference of Cultural and Educational Workers
　　Establishes Cultural and Educational Workers' Union
　　[Our Newspaper's News] Zhangjiakou News from Chahar: The first representative conference of cultural and educational workers of Chahar Province was held in Zhangjiakou on the 5th of this month. More than 90 representatives of cultural and educational workers' unions from all over the province attended. At the meeting, Hu Shangli and 33 others were elected to form the executive committee of the Chahar Provincial Cultural and Educational Workers' Union. The Chahar Provincial Cultural and Educational Workers' Union was officially declared established. In the morning, Dong Suiping, director of the preparatory committee of the association, reported on the preparation process. Eighteen branches have now been organized throughout the province. The number of cultural and educational workers who have joined the union has reached 1,723. Organizations are still being established and members are being developed. Then, Chairman Zhang Su of the Provincial Government spoke at the meeting. He pointed out: All cultural and educational work is mental labor and spiritual labor. Their work is valuable if it benefits the people; it is lowly if it harms the people. Therefore, it is not appropriate for cultural and educational workers to regard themselves as too high or too low. Today, mental laborers join the trade union, which means returning to the ranks of the working people, which is worthy of everyone's joy. In the past, people did not regard mental laborers as the working class; mental laborers themselves did not regard themselves as the working class. Now, "we must thoroughly realize class consciousness." Sun Ming, director of the Provincial Federation of Trade Unions, called on everyone at the meeting to study hard, strengthen ties with class brothers, help class brothers improve their culture, and combine scientific knowledge with production. Give full play to the strength of cultural and educational workers and promote production. Xu Zhiyuan, Deputy Minister of the Propaganda Department of the Hebei Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, explained in his speech that the main target of cultural and educational work in the future is the working people, and everyone should serve the working people. Li Shunqin, Director of the Provincial Department of Education, called on everyone to improve themselves, arm themselves with Marxist-Leninist theory, rectify their own ranks, and organize themselves well.

　　察省召开文教工作者代表大会
    成立文教工作者工会
    【本报讯】察哈尔消息：察省第一届文教工作者工会代表大会于本月五日在张家口召开，到全省各地文教工作者工会代表九十余人。会上选出了胡尚理等三十四人组成察省文教工作者工会执行委员会。察省文教工作者工会至此正式宣告成立。上午，该会筹委会主任董遂平报告了筹备经过。全省现已组织了十八个分会。参加了工会组织的文教工作者已达一千七百二十三名。现在还在继续建立组织、发展会员。接着，省府张苏主席在会上讲话。他指出：一切文教工作都是脑力劳动，精神劳动。他们的工作凡是有益于人民的都是宝贵的；凡有害于人民的都是下贱的。因此文教工作者把自己看得过高或过低都不恰当。今天脑力劳动者参加工会，是回到劳动队伍中来，值得大家喜欢。过去人家不把脑力劳动者看作劳动阶级；脑力劳动者自己也不把自己看作劳动阶级，现在“要彻底地来个阶级觉悟”。省总工会孙明主任在会上号召大家努力学习，加强和阶级弟兄的联系，帮助阶级弟兄提高文化，把科学知识与生产结合起来。高度发挥文教工作者的力量，推动生产。中共热河省委宣传部徐志远副部长在讲话中说明今后文教工作的主要对象是劳动人民，大家要为劳动人民服务。省府教育厅李舜琴厅长号召大家提高自己，用马列主义理论武装自己的头脑；整顿好自己的队伍，很好地组织起来。
