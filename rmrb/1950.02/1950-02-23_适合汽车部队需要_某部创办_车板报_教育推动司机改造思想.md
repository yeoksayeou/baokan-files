[Xinhua News Agency Report] A certain motor vehicle regiment of the Logistics Department of the Fourth Field Army of the People's Liberation Army achieved significant results by using "vehicle chalkboards" for ideological education and promoting work. Vehicle chalkboards are a type of newspaper suitable for the needs of motor vehicle units, because motor vehicle corps are highly mobile, and soldiers mostly live in driving compartments and on highways, and their actions are very scattered. Therefore, the regiment created vehicle chalkboards written in chalk on the vehicles to promptly carry out commendations and criticisms, in order to correct deviations and transform thinking. For example, in the 4th Company of the regiment, there was a soldier who never wanted to help others. Once, he accidentally helped someone repair a "transformer," and the vehicle chalkboard immediately praised him. Later, he changed for the better and often helped others. A driver in the 5th Company ran over a dog while driving. The vehicle chalkboard immediately wrote: "The driver of this vehicle should make a self-criticism. Running over a dog while driving means that one did not drive slowly in cities and villages. The loss of a dog's life is considered 'written off,' violating mass discipline and creating a bad political impact." Whoever saw it read it out loud, and the criticized comrade promised that such an accident would never happen again. The vehicle chalkboard of the 8th Company combined with the criticism movement also achieved great results. For example, when the entire company was doing camouflage, the first platoon did the best after criticism, so it was announced on the vehicle chalkboard. After seeing this, each platoon encouraged each other to work hard to catch up. When evaluating compliance with driver regulations, those who performed better were also announced on the vehicle chalkboard, so that those who did not pay much attention to compliance with driver regulations also paid attention to compliance. The vehicle chalkboard can also be used to convey instructions and calls from administrative and Party branches. For example, the Political Department of the regiment once put forward six prevention slogans: prevent danger, prevent air raids, prevent fire, prevent spies, prevent disease, prevent bad elements. The vehicle chalkboard was used to promptly carry out dissemination and education. The vehicle chalkboard is led by the propaganda committee member of the Communist Party branch. The work is arranged in a timely manner through military conferences at a certain period or according to the tasks of each stage. Each class can select a soldier with a higher level of political awareness and culture to serve as a correspondent. In general, contributions should focus on praise, but appropriate criticism should also be carried out at the same time; it is best to obtain the consent of the individual before publishing critical manuscripts. Any military secrets such as the direction of travel and the names of the items being transported must not be announced on the vehicle chalkboard. The length of time for which each issue of the contribution is published can be determined according to the magnitude of its effect.

　　适合汽车部队需要
    某部创办“车板报” 
    教育推动司机改造思想
    【新华社讯】人民解放军第四野战军后勤部汽车某团，利用“车板报”进行思想教育与推动工作，获得了显著成绩。车板报是适合汽车部队需要的一种报纸，因为汽车兵团流动性大，战士们的生活多半是在驾驶棚里和公路线上，行动又很分散。因此，该团就创造了用粉笔写在车身上的车板报，来及时进行表扬与批评，达到纠正偏向和改造思想的目的。如该团四连有个战士从来不愿帮助别人，一次偶然帮人修理了一个“变压器”，车板报上马上表扬了他，后来他就转变得很好，经常帮助别人。五连一个司机驾车时轧死了一条狗，车板上立刻写着：“此车司机应检讨，开车轧死狗一条，城市乡村不慢行，狗命一条算‘报销’，群众纪律犯一项，政治影响就不好。”谁看了谁念，被批评的同志就提出保证今后再不发生事故了。八连的车板报结合评论运动也收效很大。如全连搞伪装时，经评论后一排最好，便公布在车板报上，各排看到后，就互相鼓励要努力赶上。在评遵守司机守则时，评出较好的人也在车板报上公布，使原来不大注意遵守司机守则的人也注意遵守了。利用车板报还可传达行政与党支部的指示和号召。如团政治处曾提出六防口号：防险、防空、防火、防特、防病、防坏。车板报上就及时进行传达与教育。车板报由共产党支部的宣传委员领导，一定时期或根据每一阶段的任务，通过军人大会及时布置工作，每班可选一名政治文化较高的战士担任通讯员。稿件一般应以表扬为主，但同时应进行适当的批评；批评的稿子最好得到本人同意后再发表。凡行车方向，载运物品名称等有关军事秘密材料，切不准在车板上公布。每期稿件可按其作用大小来决定公布时间的长短。
