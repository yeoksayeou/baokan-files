Xinhua News Agency, Prague, February 27th: The British "Daily Worker" published on the 25th a statement by Harry Pollitt, General Secretary of the Communist Party of Great Britain, on the results of the British general election, titled "Forward in Struggle."

Pollitt's statement pointed out: The results of the general election have brought the most serious situation to the future of the working class and the British people.

The Labour Party is back in power, but its majority is so small that the entire situation in Parliament is extremely unstable.

The policies of the Labour leadership have wasted the gains of the political progress of 1945 and allowed Conservatism to make some progress this time.

They have tried their best to bring the policies of the Conservative Party into the working-class movement, and in doing so, they have committed the heinous crime of strengthening the enemy hated by the working class.

The main part of the working class firmly resisted the Conservative offensive.

Workers are determined to resist policies that create economic crises and war. But when they supported the Labour Party to resist the Conservative attack, they did not realize that they were entrusting representation to those who were, in fact, united with the Conservative Party in terms of policy, and whose policies would only lead to economic crises and war.

The result of the election is a reactionary parliament, a parliament without Gallagher, Piratin, Pritt, or Platts-Mills to express the workers' struggle, in which the most militant voices are stifled.

This means that the most threatening offensive is about to be launched. Within a few months, the working class will be subjected to attacks from a harsh new budget and further attacks on the living conditions of the working class.

At the same time, workers will see how the United States will orchestrate its policies to further erode Britain's national independence and force it to accept demands that, unless resisted, will further impoverish British workers and increase the danger of trade crises and even a new anti-Soviet war by the United States.

In this election, only the Communist Party fought for the true policy of the working class, the only policy that can avoid the serious dangers that have now emerged.

The struggle to support this policy will now penetrate every factory, every working-class organization, street, and club.

Workers will increasingly rise up and fight to prevent repeating the terrible experiences of the years of economic depression and war.

Although we received fewer votes, the Communist Party's election campaign proved that the general rank and file of the labor movement deeply desire a policy to prevent economic crises and war.

Our opinions were listened to with the utmost attention, the circulation of our publications reached an unprecedented scale, new members and readers of the "Daily Worker" increased by the hundreds, and the fundraising reached a landmark scale.

Workers are full of hatred for Conservatism, but they have not yet fully understood the responsibility of the right-wing Labour leaders for the progress made by the Conservative Party. They voted for the Labour Party instead of voting for our candidates, thinking that this was the way to defeat the Conservative Party.

However, hundreds of thousands of people, although they did not vote for us, agreed with the policies we put forward. In the coming period, millions of people will learn from their own experience that they must fight for this policy.

Actual life and the whole situation into which we are rapidly entering will result in the intensification of class struggle and the breaking of deeply rooted illusions.

The major issues will not be resolved on the stage of this reactionary parliament, but will be resolved by the struggles of the working masses in factories and streets.

Every Communist and every supporter of the Communist Party will be proud of the election campaign we have conducted. This election campaign stems from a political conviction, believing in the justice of our cause, believing that no force in the world can stop its progress.

We now have a great responsibility to the working people of Britain, to win them over to fight for the difficult new tasks created by this election. Therefore, let us move towards new battles, keep every new reader won by the "Daily Worker," and ensure that every possible step is taken to guide new members of the Communist Party to participate in activities.

There is no need for pessimism, because we know that communism has triumphed in half the world, so we can be sure that in our lifetime, we will do the same in Britain.

　　关于英国选举结果
    波立特发表声明
    号召在斗争中前进
    【新华社布拉格二十七日电】英国工人日报于二十五日刊登英国共产党总书记波立特关于英国大选结果的声明，题为“在斗争中前进”。
    波立特的声明指出：大选的结果，给工人阶级和英国人民的未来带来了最严重的情况。
    工党再度登台了，但其所占多数是这样的小，以致议会中的整个情况极端不稳定。
    工党领导方面的政策，已浪费了一九四五年政治进展的收获，并使得保守主义这次得以有所进展。
    他们极力把保守党的政策带到工人阶级运动中来，这样，他们就犯了加强工人阶级所痛恨的敌人这一罪大恶极的罪行。
    工人阶级的主要部分，坚定地抵抗了保守主义的攻势。
    工人们有决心抵抗制造经济危机和战争的政策。但当他们拥护工党以抵挡保守主义的进攻时，他们没有了解到他们将代表资格付托给了那些事实上在政策方面与保守党联合一致的人们，他们的政策只会招致经济危机和战争。
    选举的结果是一个反动的议会，一个没有加拉赫、皮拉丁、普里特或普拉茨--米尔斯来表达工人斗争的议会，在这一议会上，最富于战斗性的呼声被窒息了。
    这意味着威胁最大的攻势行将发动。在几个月之内，工人阶级必将遭受苛重的新预算的攻击和对工人阶级生活状况的进一步进攻。
    同时，工人们将看到美国将如何调度它的政策，以进一步侵蚀英国的国家独立，力迫接受其要求，这种要求，除非予以抵抗，则将使英国工人更加穷困化，并增加贸易危机以至美国反苏新战争的危险。
    在这次选举中，唯有共产党才为真正的工人阶级的政策而斗争，只有这种政策才可以避免现在已经出现的这些严重的危险。
    拥护这一政策的斗争，现在将深入到每一工厂、每一工人阶级的组织、街道和俱乐部中。
    工人们将越来越多地起而响应并进行斗争，以防止重复那经济萧条及战争岁月中可怖的经验。
    我们所得的票数虽然比较少，但是，共产党的竞选运动，证明了劳工运动的一般下层群众深愿有一个防止经济危机与战争的政策。
    我们的意见被最郑重注意地谛听，我们的读物的流传达到了空前的规模，新党员和工人日报的读者成百地增加，款项的募集达到划时代的规模。
    工人们满心痛恨保守主义，但还没有充分了解工党右翼领袖应负保守党得有进展的责任，他们投工党的票而不投票选举我们的候选人，认为这是打败保守党的办法。
    但是，有数十万人虽没有投我们的票，却是赞成我们所提出的政策的。今后的一个时期，将有千百万人会根据他们自己的经验而了解到必须为这一政策进行战斗。
    实际生活和我们正迅速进入其中的整个形势，其结果，将使阶级斗争紧张起来，并打破根深蒂固的幻想。
    重大的问题不会是在这一反动议会的舞台上解决的，而将是由工人群众在工厂和街道上的斗争中来解决。
    每一个共产党员及其共产党的拥护者，都会以我们所进行了的竞选运动为荣。这个竞选运动乃是出于一种政治信念，相信我们事业的正义性，相信世界上没有任何力量能够阻挡它的前进。
    我们现在对英国的劳动人民负有重大的责任，即争取他们为这次选举所产生的困难的新任务而斗争。因此，让我们迈向新的战斗，保持工人日报所争取到的每一个新读者，保证采取每一可能的步骤，以引导共产党的新党员参加活动。
    丝毫不用悲观，因为，我们知道，共产主义已在半个世界上取得了胜利，所以，可以确定，在我们这一生，我们也要在英国做到这一点。
