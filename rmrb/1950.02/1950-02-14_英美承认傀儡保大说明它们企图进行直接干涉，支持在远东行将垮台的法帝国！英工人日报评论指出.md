Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 12th: According to a Reuters dispatch from London on the 8th: The British Communist Party's newspaper, the *Daily Worker*, commented on the 8th on the Anglo-American recognition of the puppet Bảo Đại regime, stating: "This indicates that Britain and the United States are attempting direct intervention to support France's collapsing empire in the Far East." The dispatch also revealed that most of the British bourgeois newspapers responded coldly to this, limiting themselves to publishing short news items. *The Manchester Guardian* and *The News Chronicle* also expressed doubt about whether the British government's recognition was appropriate. *The Manchester Guardian* said: "It is almost undeniable that Vietnam (referring to Bảo Đại) at least does not possess the legal conditions usually required for recognizing a new regime." *The News Chronicle* believes that Britain's recognition of the Bảo Đại regime is "Bevin's biggest gamble since taking office as Foreign Secretary."

　　英美承认傀儡保大说明它们企图进行直接干涉，支持在远东行将垮台的法帝国！
    英工人日报评论指出
    【新华社北京十二日电】据路透社伦敦八日消息：英共机关报工人日报八日在评论英美两国承认保大傀儡政权时称：“这指明英美企图进行直接干涉，来支持法国在远东的行将垮台的帝国。”该电又透露，英资产阶级报纸多数对此表示冷淡，仅限于发表短讯。曼彻斯特卫报和新闻纪事报，对英国政府这种承认是否适宜也表示怀疑。曼彻斯特卫报说：“这几乎是不容否认的，越南（按指保大）至少没有具备通常承认新政权所需要的法律条件。”新闻纪事报则认为英国的承认保大政权，是“贝文自从出长外交部以来最大的一次赌博。”
