Let the Imperialists Weep, We Shall Sing with Joy!
    Jin Feng
    While progressive people all over the world are cheering and rejoicing, and Wall Street's warmongers are trembling, a dozen or so professors from Peking University, along with their wives and children, were enthusiastically shouting "Long live Chairman Mao!" "Long live Stalin!" "Long live Sino-Soviet friendship!" This was one of the hundreds of celebration parties held in Beijing on the evening of February 15th to celebrate the signing of the Sino-Soviet New Treaty, a celebration party held by the professors in the faculty housing on Fuxue Hutong at Peking University.

    Before eight o'clock, the small living room was already crowded with dozens of adults and children. Professor Yuan Hanqing, beaming with joy, held up the newspaper and read out the full text of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance.

    Professor Wang Tieya of the Department of Political Science began by explaining the difference between "treaty" and "agreement" in response to questions raised by everyone. He said that a treaty is a written resolution between two countries on comprehensive issues, while an agreement is mostly a temporary agreement or an agreement on partial issues. For example, the Sino-Changchun Railway and Lushun-Dalian agreements are agreements on local issues, and the loan agreement is an agreement on temporary issues, etc. Then he analyzed the content and nature of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance and the two agreements. He also compared it with the Sino-Soviet Treaty of 1945. He believed that although the contents of the two were different, from the Soviet side's point of view, it did not represent a change in the Soviet Union's past and present foreign policy, but rather the result of the Soviet Union taking different approaches to assist the Chinese people based on different circumstances. He said: Now that the Chinese people have stood up, it is possible to express the historical friendship between China and the Soviet Union in a clear treaty form. He believed that only countries where the people are the masters can conclude such a truly friendly alliance treaty of mutual assistance based entirely on friendship.

    Associate Professor Wang Xuan of the Department of Law followed by saying: "This treaty has created a new era in the history of China's conclusion of international treaties. Because the Chinese people have suffered the bitter fruits of the invasion and exploitation of unequal treaties by imperialism in the hundred years of semi-colonial life. The Soviet Union was the first country to abolish the unequal treaties concluded by Tsarist Russia with our country, but the Chinese people at that time were unable to freely interact with the Soviet Union under the oppression of the reactionary regime. Only now can the people of the two countries freely exchange their deep brotherly friendship." Professor Chen Xiangrui of the Department of Political Science added: This kind of feeling is based on the common ideals of the Chinese and Soviet people in their struggle for the liberation and peace of mankind. His words filled those present with deep satisfaction and clearly aroused a sense of happiness immersed in lofty ideals.

    With gratitude for the deep friendship of the Soviet Union, the professors talked excitedly about the loan agreement. Professor Wang Tieya said that, as far as he knew, such a constructive loan with low interest and without any conditions was rare in the world. He spoke with great indignation about the so-called loans that many imperialist countries had made to China in the past, and each time they extorted many of China's customs duties, salt taxes and other rights as collateral. "And—many professors couldn't help but say—those railway construction rights, mining rights, inland waterway navigation rights, etc.!" "And—old professor Huang Juefei said—how much rebate did those damn loans have! Ten to twenty percent of them went to the imperialist monopoly capitalists and their lackeys—the Chinese comprador class." The atmosphere in the meeting place was obviously heavy, and the professors were filled with irrepressible resentment towards the Chinese and foreign reactionaries who had ravaged and devastated the Chinese people in the past.

    However, when Professor Yang Rengeng of the Department of History mentioned the great impact of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance on crushing the warmongers' dreams, everyone's spirits immediately lifted. "Think about it, how will those Wall Street bosses and a small group of bandits in Taiwan react when they hear this news," a professor's wife exclaimed happily. "Naturally, their fear and clamor, slander and rumor are to be expected," another gentleman continued, "but what effect can their rumors really have? A few days ago, Acheson shamelessly fabricated the rumor that the Soviet Union wanted to annex Chinese territory; but, as soon as our treaty was announced, didn't their rumors once again declare bankruptcy in front of the people of the world?"

    Let the imperialists weep, we are now going to celebrate our victory to the fullest. Excited by this victory, the professors solemnly sang the Internationale and the March of the Volunteers.

　　让帝国主义者去哭泣吧，我们要欢乐地歌唱！
    金凤
    当全世界的进步人民都在鼓舞欢腾，华尔街的战争贩子正在战栗的时候，北京大学的十几位教授和他们的太太、孩子们，在热情地高呼“毛主席万岁！”“斯大林万岁！”“中苏友好万岁！”这是二月十五日晚上北京各界为了中苏新约的签订而举行的几百个庆祝晚会中的一个，是北京大学府学胡同教授宿舍中教授们所举行的庆祝晚会。
    不到八时，小小的客厅已被几十个大人孩子挤满了。袁翰青教授喜气洋洋地捧着报纸，宣读了中苏友好同盟互助条约全文。
    政治系教授王铁崖，一开始就解释大家所提的问题—“条约”和“协定”的区别。他说条约是两国间有关全面性问题的文字决议，协定则多半为临时性的，或局部问题的协议。譬如中长路、旅大协定是有关局部性问题的协议，贷款协定是临时性问题的协定等。接着他分析了中苏友好同盟互助条约及两个协定的内容与性质。他又以此和一九四五年的中苏条约作了比较。他认为两者的内容虽有所不同，但从苏联方面来说，并不是表示苏联以前和现在的外交政策的改变，而是苏联依据不同的情况，采取不同的方式来援助中国人民的结果。他说：现在中国人民已经站立起来了，因此就能够使中苏两国历史性的友谊，用条约的形式，显明地表达了出来。他认为也只有双方都是人民作主的国家才有可能缔结这样的完全建立在友好基础上的真正友好同盟互助的条约。
    法律系副教授王暄紧接着说：“这个条约在中国缔结国际条约的历史上创立了新的纪元。因为中国人民在百年来半殖民地的痛苦生活中，饱尝了帝国主义不平等条约侵略榨削的苦果。苏联是第一个废除了帝俄与我国缔结的不平等条约的国家，但中国人民那时在反动政权压迫之下还不可能与苏联自由往来。只有到了现在，两国人民才能够自由地彼此交流深厚的兄弟般的友谊”。另一位政治系教授陈祥瑞补充说：这种感情，是建立在中苏两国人民所共同具有的为着人类的解放与和平而奋斗的理想的基础上的。他的这句话令在场的人感到深深的满意，并显然引起了大家的一种浸润在崇高的理想中的幸福的感觉。
    怀着对苏联的深厚友谊的感激，教授们十分兴奋地谈起了贷款协定。王铁崖教授说，据他所知道的，国际间这样不带任何条件的低利的建设性的贷款确是罕见的。他十分愤慨地谈到过去许多帝国主义国家也对中国有过所谓贷款，而每次总是勒索中国很多的海关、盐税等权益作为抵押。“还有——许多教授都不胜愤慨地抢着说——那些铁路建筑权、矿山开采权、内河航行权等等哩”！“还有——老教授黄觉非说——那些该死的贷款都有多么大的回扣！其中百分之十到二十都是落到帝国主义的独占资本家及其奴才——中国的买办阶级手中去了。”会场的空气显然沉重了起来，教授们对于过去蹂躏、摧残中国人民的中外反动派，充满了难以抑制的愤恨。
    可是，当史学系教授杨人梗一提到现在签订的中苏友好同盟互助的对于粉碎战争贩子的迷梦所起的巨大影响时，大家的精神就立刻振奋起来了。“想一想吧，那些华尔街的老板和台湾的一小撮匪徒，他们听到了这个消息会有怎样的反响”，一位教授太太十分快活地嚷着。“自然，他们的恐惧与叫嚣、诬蔑与造谣是在意料中的”，另一位先生接着说：“实实在在的，他们的谣言能起什么作用呢？前几天艾奇逊还无耻地制造什么苏联要吞并中国领土的谣言；可是，我们的条约一公布，他们的谣言不是又一次在全世界人民的面前宣布破产了吗”？
    让帝国主义者去哭泣吧，我们现在要尽情地来庆祝我们的胜利了。被这一胜利激动了的教授们，十分庄严地唱起了国际歌和祖国进行曲来。
