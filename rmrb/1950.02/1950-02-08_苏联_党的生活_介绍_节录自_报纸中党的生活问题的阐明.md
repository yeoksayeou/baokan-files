　　Introduction to "Party Life" in the Soviet Union
　　——Excerpt from "Elucidation of Party Life Issues in Newspapers"
    The work of the Party Life Department is to elucidate the life and activities of our Party – the vanguard of the working class, the great organizer and inspirer of the Soviet people – and at the same time to elucidate the life and work of our local Party organizations.

    The Party Life Department should occupy its own special position in the newspapers of the states and republics. “In the resolutions of the Party and the Central Committee of the Party, regarding Party Life, many detailed instructions are given, according to which the work of the Party should include the following points: 1. To explain the resolutions of Party organs and the tasks of lower-level Party organizations regarding Party building. 2. To explain the work and plans of Party organs. 3. To inspect and elucidate the implementation of Party instructions. 4. To explain the situation and activities of local Party organizations. 5. To explain and promote new forms and methods of Party work and Party mass work. 6. To elucidate the life of the Communist Youth League and the leadership of Party organs over the Youth League organizations.

    Therefore, the Party Life Department is to elucidate Party internal life and Party political work. It should unite and educate Communist Party members to improve the working level of Party organizations so that they can truly supervise the activities of local state and economic organs and realize the Party's political and organizational role among the masses.”

    Our publications – especially newspapers, the most important political and organizational tool in the hands of the Party – can only accomplish this task under the condition of close and vital connection. Publications are the most sensitive political tools, and their content is determined by the political and organizational tasks facing the Party at each stage.

    The All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) Central Committee combines the reconstruction of Party work and the improvement of our publications.

    Following the instructions of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) Central Committee, newspaper editorial departments have made considerable efforts in their own newspapers to better elucidate Party Life. It should be pointed out that the explanation of Party Life has improved after the All-Union Communist Party's famous resolution on the issues of Party organization and Party political work: first, the material on "Party Life" appears more frequently in newspapers, and the scope of Party Life issues has become more diverse. Essays based on in-depth research and dissemination of Party work experience have appeared. For example, the "Kursk Pravda" systematically explains the life of Party organizations in various districts and states. It widely explains the issues of past Party congresses and publishes many interesting selected articles such as "District Committees and Rural Intellectuals," "Collective Farm Youth in Harvesting," "Collective Farm Party Secretaries Spreading Experience," "Party Workers Have a Sense of Freshness," "Leading Collective Farms with Differentiation," "One Year of Work Implementing the February Resolution of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) Central Committee" (describing the experience of an advanced district in Kursk Oblast), "On the Secretaries of Collective Farm Party Organizations," "The Training of Agricultural Cadres – A Cause of Great National Importance," etc. The "Kursk Pravda" helps Party organization workers by pointing out to them what important and valuable strategies should be carried out.

    The experience of "Soviet Siberia News" in explaining Party Life issues is also noteworthy; the secretaries of collective farm Party organizations spread their work experience in the newspaper, narrating how they supervise collective farm work and how they carry out mass political work. This column is concluded by the district committee secretary, titled: "Striving for Collective Farm Party Organizations Full of Vitality." "Soviet Siberia News" also published a series of articles entitled: "Helping the Secretaries of Collective Farm Party Organizations." During the election campaign, the newspaper published daily reports on the work of propaganda stations and systematically explained the work of a good propaganda station - the editorial department was able to disseminate the best experience in mass political work. After the election, the newspaper published many articles that provided a lot of help to Party organizations in improving propaganda work among the working masses. "Soviet Siberia News" also organized exchanges of propaganda work experience, publishing articles by leaders of many political schools and groups.

    Criticism of the shortcomings of Party organizations leading economic organs should be widely unfolded in the newspaper, and at the same time, the Party Life Department should use concrete examples to detail how Party organizations fulfill their responsibility for politically leading economic activities and supervising them, and how the relationship between Party organizations and economic organs should be set up.

    It should be constantly explained in our newspapers: making Party organizations separate from directly engaging in economic affairs does not mean withdrawing from the economy. It does not mean weakening leadership, but rather raising the level of economic leadership. Therefore, it is necessary to strengthen leadership to make it more effective and more targeted, to reject incorrect leadership methods and to use Party organizations to replace economic organs.

    It should be explained to Party workers: forgetting Party political work among the masses is not only a factual shortcoming, but a political error.

    The newspaper should always care about encouraging the activities of workers, care about the forms and methods of district committee and primary organization secretaries leading them, and help them smoothly carry out agitation work among the masses.

    Party organizations provide many different working methods among the laborers: radio, movies, theaters, publications, etc. It is necessary to help Party organizations properly use these mass propaganda methods, improve the leadership of the ideological front, and strengthen the struggle against the remnants of bourgeois ideology. Local writers' associations, movies, radio broadcasts, theaters, clubs, cultural palaces, etc. – all these are direct assistants of Party organizations in educating the people in the spirit of communism and unfolding political work among the masses. It is necessary to continuously use all methods of ideologically influencing the masses to make them subordinate to the political education of the laborers. In this regard, our newspaper's Party Life Department should play a significant role.

    The task of the Party Life Department is to systematically explain Party Life issues, to criticize incorrect leadership methods in Party internal work, to further explain the issue of Party internal democracy, and also to explain the principles and significance of collectivity in Party work, to raise the role of the plenary sessions, bureaus, Party activist meetings, and Party primary organization meetings of Party committees.

    It is also necessary to strengthen the explanation of the ideological and political education of Communist Party members, the work of groups and political schools, the work of cadres and their Bolshevik education. These and other topics of Party internal life should be solemnly studied on the basis of in-depth research on the life of Party organizations. Party internal life issues are so important that they cannot be "just touched on," or lightly talked about; they need to be deeply studied and independently handled.

    The work of the Party primary organizations needs special attention, because Communist Party members are first educated and tempered here in the spirit of Bolshevism. It is necessary to publish more frequently profound and substantive articles and communications, using vivid materials to explain all aspects of the work of the primary organizations, containing critical analysis of shortcomings, explaining Bolshevik economics, and giving useful suggestions, etc. The state newspaper should be a constantly active correspondence research class for the secretaries of Party primary organizations.

    The newspaper must publish materials explaining the Party's requirements for each Party member, the rights and obligations of Party members, the significance of Party members' ideological improvement, and the significance of Party members' active role in Party organizational life in order to successfully solve the tasks of socialist construction. When explaining the internal life issues of Party organizations, the newspaper should educate each Party member and probationary member to correctly implement the spirit of the All-Union Communist Party Constitution and abide by the spirit of the Party's iron discipline.

    It is very important for the Party Life Department to determine the fundamental problems of Party work and help Party organizations rebuild their activities. This help is realized by criticizing shortcomings and by spreading positive experiences, that is, by using concrete positive examples to point out to everyone the methods and forms of Party organization work.

    The materials of the Party Life Department, like other departments of the newspaper, can and should be lively and in various literary forms.

### 苏联“党的生活”介绍——节录自“报纸中党的生活问题的阐明”

　　苏联“党的生活”介绍
    ——节录自“报纸中党的生活问题的阐明”
    党的生活部的工作是阐明我们的党——工人阶级的先锋队，苏维埃人民的伟大组织者和鼓舞者——的生活和活动，同时要阐明我们地方党组织的生活和工作。
    党的生活部在州和共和国的报纸中应占有它自己的特殊地位。“在党、党的中央委员会的决议中，关于党的生活部给了许多详尽的指示，依照这些指示党的工作应包括下列数点：一、解释关于党的建设方面党机关的决议和下级党组织的任务。二、说明党机关的工作和方案。三、检查并阐明党的训令的执行。四、说明地方党组织的情况和活动。五、党内工作和党的群众工作的新形式和新方法的解释与宣传。六、阐明共青团的生活和党机关对青年团组织的领导。
    因此，党的生活部是阐明党内生活和党的政治工作的，它应该团结和教育共产党员提高党组织的工作水平，使它们能够真正进行监督地方上的国家和经济机关的活动，并实现党在群众中政治的和组织的作用。”
    我们的出版物——首先是报纸，它是党的手中的最重要的政治和组织工具，报纸只有在紧密的和生活联系的条件下才能完成这个任务。出版物是最锐敏的政治工具，它的内容是由每一阶段的党的面前的政治的和组织的任务来确定。
    联共（布）中央委员会把重建党的工作和改善我们出版物的工作统一起来。
    报纸编辑部遵照着联共（布）中央委员会的指示，在自己的报纸上作了不少努力，以更好些地阐明党的生活。应该指出，在联共党有名的对党组织和党的政治工作的问题的决议后，党的生活的说明有了改进：首先是报纸上“党的生活”的材料出现得次数加多了，党的生活问题的范围变得多样了。基于深刻研究的和传播党的工作经验的论文出现了。例如“库尔斯基真理报”有系统地说明各区各州的党组织的生活，它广泛地说明过去的党的代表会的工作问题，刊登了很多有趣味的经过选择的文章如“区委会和农村知识分子”，“集体农场青年在收获”，“集体农场党书记传播经验”，“党的工作者有对新鲜事物的感觉”，“有区别地领导集体农场”，“执行联共（布）中央委员会全会二月决议的一年工作”（叙述库尔斯基州一个先进区的经验），“论集体农场党组织的书记”，“农业干部的培养——是具有伟大国家重要性的事业”等。“库尔斯基真理报”帮助党组织的工作者指给他们应该进行怎样重要的和有价值的方策。
    “苏维埃西伯利亚报”说明党的生活问题的经验也是值得注意的；集体农场党组织的书记在报纸上传播自己工作的经验，叙述他们怎样监督集体农场工作和怎样进行群众政治工作，这种通讯栏结束时由区委书记作总结，题目是：“争取集体农场党组织充满血液的生活”“苏维埃西伯利亚报”还公布了一系列文章，标题是：“帮助集体农场党组织的书记”。在选举运动期间，报纸天天公布宣传站的工作，并有系统地说明一个好的宣传站的工作——编辑部能传播群众政治工作的最好的经验。在选举以后，报纸上刊登许多文章对党组织提高劳动群众中的宣传工作给了不少帮助。“苏维埃西伯利亚报”还组织了宣传工作经验的交流，刊登了许多政治学校和小组的领导人的文章。
    在报纸上应广泛展开对党组织领导经济机关的缺点的批评，同时党的生活部应该详细地用具体例子指出党的组织怎样实现政治上领导经济活动和监督它的责任，应该怎样设置党组织和经济机关的相互关系。
    应该不断地在我们报纸上解释：使党组织脱离直接从事经济事务工作并不是说要从经济中退出来。这并不是说把领导削弱，而是要提高经济领导的水平。因此，要加强领导，使其更有作用更有目标，拒绝不正确的领导方法和用党组织来代替经济机关。
    应该对党的工作者解释：忘掉了群众中的党的政治工作这不单是事实上的缺点，而是政治性的错误。
    报纸应该时时关心鼓励工作者的活动，关心区委会和基层组织书记领导他们的形式和方法。帮助他们顺利地在群众中进行鼓动工作。
    党组织提供了许多各式各样的在劳动者中间的工作方法：无线电、电影、剧院、出版物等等，必须帮助党组织适当地利用这些群众性的宣传方法，改善思想阵线的领导，加强和资产阶级思想残余作斗争。当地的作家协会、电影、无线电广播、剧院、俱乐部、文化宫等等——所有这些都是党组织在以共产主义精神教育人民和展开群众中政治工作的直接助手。需要不停地利用一切思想上影响群众的方法使它们服从于劳动者的政治教育。在这方面，我们报纸党的生活部应该有很大的作用。
    党的生活部的任务——是要系统地说明党的生活问题，必须批评党内工作的不正确领导方法，更要说明党内民主问题，还要解释党工作中集体性的原则和意义，提高党委会的全会、局、党积极分子会议，党基层组织会议的作用。
    也必须加强说明共产党员的思想政治教育问题，小组和政治学校工作问题，干部工作及他们的布尔塞维克教育问题，这些和其他党内生活的题目，都应该在深刻研究党组织生活的基础上郑重地研究。党内生活问题是如此重要，以致不能“仅只触到”，轻轻地谈到而已，需要深刻研究，并独立地处理它。
    党的基层组织的工作需要特别注意，因为共产党员首先在此受到布尔塞维克的教育和锻炼。必须更经常的刊登深刻的有内容的文章和通讯，以生动的材料说明基层组织工作的各方面，包含有对缺点的批判性的分析，说明布尔塞维克的经济并给以有益的建议等。州报纸对于党的基层组织的书记应该是一个经常活动着的通讯研究班。
    在报纸上必须刊登解释党对每个党员的要求材料，党员的权利和义务，党员思想提高的意义，和为了成功地解决社会主义建设的任务，在党组织生活中党员积极性作用的意义。报纸在说明党组织内部生活问题的时候，应该教育每个党员和候补党员正确地执行联共党章的精神，遵从党的铁的纪律的精神。
    非常重要，党的生活部要确定党的工作的根本问题，并帮助党组织重建其活动，这个帮助的实现，有批评缺点的方法，还有传播肯定经验的方法，也就是以具体肯定的实例，指给大家党组织工作的方法和形式。
    党的生活部的材料，像报纸其他部门一样，能够并且应该是生动的各式各样的文学的形式。
