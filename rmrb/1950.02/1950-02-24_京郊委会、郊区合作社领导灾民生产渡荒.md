　　[Beijing News] Under the leadership of the Municipal Government Suburban Committee and the Municipal Supply and Marketing Cooperative, the suburban disaster victims' production and famine relief has achieved great results, with more than 10,000 disaster victims joining cooperatives in the process of organizing production for disaster relief. Currently, in Nan Yuan, more than 2,400 disaster victims have been mobilized to organize saltpeter boiling, with a total of 154 saltpeter pots. Each pot produces about 150 catties per day. Through the introduction of the North China Supply and Marketing Cooperative, a contract for 1 million catties of crude saltpeter has been signed with the Qinhuangdao State-owned Company. This production can solve the livelihood of more than 10,000 people. In addition, another 1 million catties of crude saltpeter can be produced for the cooperative to purchase. On the East Suburb side, more than 3,000 women have been mobilized to organize shoe sole making. Each pair of soles made can earn 14 taels of millet. In January, 3,000 pairs of soles were made. In February, the cooperative ordered 65,000 pairs of shoe soles from the Logistics Department and the shoe production cooperative on behalf of the members. Among them, the Shigezhuang Village Supply and Marketing Cooperative purchased corn with the wages of the members who made shoe soles and distributed it to them, and specially prepared white flour for the members during the Spring Festival. On the North Suburb side, the Supply and Marketing Branch Office established a wool spinning factory specifically for disaster victims. More than 180 women have participated in wool spinning, with an average daily output of four to five catties of wool yarn per person. In January, a total of 10,000 catties of wool yarn were produced, and each participant in wool spinning can support the living of three people. Now, more than 200 women have been organized in various villages to prepare to participate in wool spinning production. In addition, the area also organized a farmer transportation team to transport dirty soil from the city to the outside. In Xibanhe Village alone, 19 carts were organized, each cart earning 30 catties of corn per day, which also solved the fertilizer problem for spring plowing. On the West Suburb side, the Supply and Marketing Branch has organized farmers in villages such as Haidian and Liulangzhuang to make straw ropes. The Supply and Marketing Cooperative has signed a straw rope contract with the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant on their behalf. Each bundle of straw rope is equivalent to eleven and a half catties of corn. Currently, 10,200 bundles have been made, which can solve the living difficulties of more than 3,000 people. In the process of supporting and organizing production for disaster relief, the disaster victims deeply felt the benefits of the cooperative to them, and therefore, they have requested to join the cooperative. According to the statistics in January, through the work of production to overcome famine, ten more cooperatives were established in the suburbs, and the number of members reached 10,940.
