　　Reviewing the Labour Party's Policies in Light of the British Election Results
　　Hu Qi
    Britain held its second post-war parliamentary election on the 23rd of this month. In this election, the Labour Party won 315 seats, 79 fewer than in the previous election, while the Conservative Party won 294 seats, 102 more than in the previous election. This does not mean that the Conservative Party is more popular with the British people than it was in 1945, but rather that the British people have begun to doubt the deceptive propaganda and hypocritical promises of the Attlee-Bevin Labour Party. This development is the result of the ruling right-wing Labour leaders consistently pursuing anti-Soviet and anti-people policies for the past four and a half years.
    After the Second World War, the British people, having learned painful lessons from the Conservative Party's Munich policy—which almost led to the tragic demise of Britain—and from large-scale unemployment, yearned for a life of peace and stability. They powerfully expressed this desire in the first post-war election in July 1945. The British working people defeated the Conservative Party, led by Churchill, which represented the interests of big capital. The Labour Party won a majority of seats in the House of Commons with its moving promises. The right-wing leaders of the Labour Party took the stage in place of the Conservatives. But four and a half years of history have proven that the right-wing Labour leadership's various beautiful promises, such as being "friendly" to the Soviet Union, maintaining "world peace," giving the colonial people "democratic autonomy," "curbing" the power of capital, and giving workers a "good life," were nothing more than tricks to win votes. In fact, the Labour Party did not change the course set by the Conservatives but, under the guise of "collective security," "democratic autonomy," "nationalization," "mixed economy," "full employment," and so on, faithfully implemented a policy of pursuing imperialist interests.
    Anti-Soviet, Anti-People's Democratic Countries, Anti-Colonial People
    Soon after the Attlee government came to power, it began to reveal that, like the Churchill Conservative Party, it had no sincerity in establishing friendly relations with the Soviet Union; it wholeheartedly followed the anti-Soviet line outlined by Churchill in his Fulton speech. Although the Soviet Union could supply large quantities of grain and certain important raw materials for the life of the British people, who had long been in distress, and for British industry, and although the Soviet Union, which was committed to recovery and construction after the war, could provide a vast market for important British exports on a mutually beneficial basis, the right-wing Labour leaders, driven by class hatred against the Soviet Union, consistently obstructed the establishment and development of friendly and trade relations between the two countries in various ways. Under the pressure of domestic economic difficulties and the demands of the people, the Labour government repeatedly proposed and negotiated limited trade agreements with the Soviet Union, but it always took a dilatory attitude toward long-term trade agreements that would clearly be very beneficial to the British people, leaving the negotiations fruitless. Not only that, but the heads of the Labour government also hindered Soviet procurement in Britain and arbitrarily slandered the Soviet Union. Since accepting the enslaving Marshall Plan "aid" in 1947, the Labour government, in accordance with the will of American imperialism, explicitly prohibited the shipment of many important exports to the vast markets of the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe; and, following in the footsteps of the American reactionaries, launched the so-called anti-Soviet "Cold War," and participated in the organization of various aggressive economic, political, and military blocs aimed at opposing the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries, such as the "North Atlantic Treaty," the "Western European Union," the "Council of Europe," the "United States of Europe" movement, the "Socialist International," and the "Mediterranean Pact" currently under discussion, and so on. At all major international conferences, the representatives of the Labour government were the most energetic partners of the American imperialists.
    In implementing imperialist overseas colonial and plundering policies, the Labour Party's enthusiasm has repeatedly been cheered by the Conservative Party. After the anti-fascist war had ended, the Labour Party maintained a huge army of millions of people for a long time and carried out brutal suppression of the people of colonial and dependent countries seeking their own independence and liberation. The Greek people under the bloody terror rule of the royal fascists will always remember the crimes of British imperialism. The African people of the Gold Coast, Eritrea, and Nigeria, the Jews and Arabs of Palestine, and the Greek Orthodox Christians of Cyprus will not forget the "military might" of the British army. The heroic people of Malaya, who were once liberated from the iron heel of Japanese fascism, have been devastated by the British colonial army for years. And the Indian and Pakistani people of the Indian subcontinent will painfully remember who, behind the veil of "giving you independence," continuously created large-scale bloodshed and famine that caused tens of thousands of lives to perish each year.
    Relying on American Imperialism and Losing Economic Autonomy
    Since the Labour government resolutely implemented a policy of opposing the Soviet Union and suppressing the liberation movements of colonial and dependent countries, it could not but rely on American imperialism and beg for "aid" in the form of gold dollars. Immediately after taking office, the Labour Party negotiated and signed an agreement with the United States, abandoning the preferential system of the imperial economic chain and abolishing controls on the exchange of the pound sterling for a loan of $3.75 billion (July 1946), opening the door for American capital to invade the economy of the sterling area. Subsequently, the Attlee government, disregarding widespread opposition from the people, accepted the enslaving "Marshall Plan Bilateral Agreement" (July 1948), selling out the autonomy of the British economy to the Americans. The "Military Cooperation Agreement" on maintaining the wartime Anglo-American Joint Chiefs of Staff, established in early 1947, the "North Atlantic Treaty" concluded in April last year, and the "North Atlantic Regional Defense Plan" agreement signed in January this year, have made the British mainland a troop staging area and supply base for American preparations for aggressive war. Although the continuous expansion of American imperialism during and after the war has led to increasingly fierce conflicts of interest with British imperialism in every corner of the capitalist world, and although from continental Europe to South America, from the Middle East to the Pacific, from non-sterling areas to sterling areas, American capital and goods are increasingly rudely squeezing out the power of the British Empire, and although British imperialists have struggled in some vital situations, since the Labour government has decided to adopt the general line of relying on the dollar, Britain can only increasingly lose its independent position and become dependent on the United States. It is no accident that the Labour Party and its "opposition party"—the Conservative Party—have been so coordinated on all major foreign policy issues.
    Because the Labour government insisted on relying on the dollar, insisting on opposing the Soviet Union, and insisting on a policy of aggression, the international balance of payments crisis, which is the main symptom of Britain's post-war economic difficulties, has become increasingly serious. Despite repeated cuts in so-called dollar imports and despite drinking poison to quench thirst by accepting billions of dollars in so-called "loans," "gifts," or "aid," the net deficit of the entire sterling area still rose from £226 million for the whole of 1946 to £239 million for the first half of 1949; gold and dollar reserves fell from £664 million at the end of 1946 to £406 million at the end of June 1949, and further to more than £350 million in mid-September. For Britain itself, according to the latest statistics from the Department of Commerce, the deficit for January this year was £19.6 million, with an annual rate still reaching £235 million. The dollar deficit for the entire sterling area reached an annual rate of £528 million in the first half of last year, of which Britain accounted for £230 million. Despite the Labour government's vociferous calls to increase exports to the dollar area, Britain's exports to North America fell from 8 percent of Britain's total exports in 1947 to 7 percent in the third quarter of 1949.
    "Nationalization" Policy Serving Big Capital
    Inseparably linked to the imperialist policy abroad is the Labour Party's anti-working-people policy at home. Here, the Labour Party even completed certain services for big capital that were not easy for the Conservative Party to complete. To illustrate this point, it is best to take the Labour Party's much-touted so-called "nationalization" as an example. The Labour government implemented seven Labour Party "mixed economy" theory so-called "nationalization" bills, including coal mines, domestic transport, electricity, overseas aviation, gas, telegraphs, and the Bank of England. They did not change the capitalist system of exploitation in the slightest. On the contrary, it was not the working people who benefited, but big capital. The Labour government nominally took over some dilapidated and loss-making business sectors from the capitalists, paid the capitalists so-called "compensation" far exceeding their original share value under the guise of "nationalization," and guaranteed that the original owners would still be given profits equivalent to or even several times more than they had ever received, regardless of whether the business made a profit or loss. The "state" paid billions of dollars taken from the working people for this purpose. And all of these enterprises are still in the hands of the original boards of directors or representatives appointed by the London "City." The only practically meaningful change for the working people is that they have been effectively deprived of the right to negotiate and strike. Because, it is said, these enterprises are now "state" enterprises, and workers cannot harm "national interests." But to this day, even this so-called "nationalization" has not touched Britain's key industries—the steel industry and some large monopoly capital such as the chemical and insurance industries, especially the arms industry, because these enterprises still maintain very high profits, and the capitalists do not need the Labour government to do it for them.
    The Labour Party's "nationalization" is such a clever method that it transfers the losses of capitalist enterprises to the working people, guarantees that capitalists receive high profits every year, and at the same time relieves them of the trouble of negotiating with workers. From this, one can see the mystery of the Labour Party's "nationalization" and can also suddenly realize the true meaning of the Labour Party's various economic and social policies. If it is said that the Labour government did implement some things like social insurance and national health care, then it is not difficult for people to imagine that it is indeed an inexpensive business for the Labour Party's right-wing leaders to allocate a very small amount from the billions of pounds of income taken from the working people each year, give some small favors, and greatly publicize its so-called "welfare state," spreading illusions about the Labour Party among the working masses.
    Pound Devaluation and "Austerity Plan"
    In order to further facilitate the invasion of the dollar and promote the arms race, the Labour government made two more decisions in the second half of last year that seriously betrayed the interests of the British working people: on September 18, it announced the devaluation of the pound, reducing its value against the dollar by 30 percent; and on October 24, it announced the so-called "austerity" plan, greatly reducing expenses on productive investment, housing construction, and social welfare.
    The devaluation of the pound is a direct result of the Labour Party's compliance with dollar pressure. This widely condemned decision is beneficial to American capital expanding overseas, and it has further increased the authority of the dollar over the sterling area and regions linked to the pound. After the devaluation, the United States can receive much greater benefits with the same dollar than before the devaluation, while Britain must increase its export volume by more than 40 percent to exchange for the same amount of dollars as before the devaluation. This decision is naturally also beneficial to British big capital, who can take the opportunity to raise prices and profit from it; especially for exporters, each dollar they earn after the devaluation can be exchanged for two and a half more shillings. Even Cripps, the Labour government's Chancellor of the Exchequer, who announced the devaluation himself, admitted that it was particularly a burden on workers. But he hid the most essential meaning of this decision, which is: it is a major attack on the living standards of the British working people. The weekly wholesale price index of the London Economist magazine has very definitely shown this inevitable trend. In the two months from September 21 to November 22, the index rose by a total of thirteen points. In fact, the price of bread was announced to increase by one-third at the same time as Cripps announced the devaluation. But on the other hand, according to the government's wage freeze policy, workers' wages are not allowed to increase.
    As for the so-called "austerity" plan, it is a powerful illustration of the Labour government's concentration of greater efforts on aggressive military preparations, regardless of the life and death of the people. Attlee demanded a reduction of £250 million in non-military expenditures, of which £140 million was for productive construction, and more than £100 million was stipulated to be made up by layoffs, pay cuts, and cuts in education, health, agriculture, and other expenses. According to this "austerity" plan, housing construction, which is urgently needed in Britain after the war, will be reduced by another 25,000 units next year compared to the current number, which is less than half of its construction capacity. Many school and business construction and expansion plans will be cancelled, port repairs will be delayed, 10,000 civil servants and tens of thousands of workers will lose their jobs, and food subsidies will be greatly reduced. And all of these "savings" are only for the purpose of increasing the huge military expenditure for the 1949-50 fiscal year, which has so far reached £900 million (one-third of which is used for overseas military activities), to £1.2 billion in the next fiscal year. That is equivalent to one-eighth of the total national income in 1948.
    Deterioration of the Living Standards of the Working People
    One can imagine that under the Labour Party's policy of wholeheartedly serving big capital, the situation of the working people will never be truly improved. Facts have proven that the lives of the working people, which had greatly deteriorated during the war, have deteriorated even further under the Labour Party's fake "socialism." According to official figures, retail prices rose by 12 percent from June 1947 to September 1949, of which the two most important parts of people's lives, clothing and food, increased by 19 and 17 percent respectively, while the wage rate rose by only 9 percent during the same period (British Labour Department Magazine, October 1949). Compared with pre-war 1938, the wholesale price index rose by 118 percent by the first quarter of 1949, while wages rose by only 92 percent. These are still official figures, and the actual situation is naturally worse than what the official figures admit. At the same time, corporate profits have seen huge increases. According to a white paper published by Cripps last April, profits have increased more than threefold from 1938 to the first quarter of 1949. In 1948, the income from interest, profits, and rent of capitalists and landlords accounted for 41 percent of the total national income, and after taxes, there was still a net surplus of 2.922 billion pounds, an amount equal to four-fifths of the total annual wage income of all workers. The Labour Party's policy has played a very caring role for capitalists in this harvest. For example, from 1946 to 1948, the tax on profits was reduced by 80 million pounds, while the collection of income tax and insurance premiums from wage earners increased by 55 million pounds, and indirect taxes mainly borne by the working people increased by 502 million pounds. The frequency of strikes by the working people for their own hardships reflects the depth of the deterioration of their lives. Regardless of the opposition from the right-wing leaders of the Trade Union Congress, British workers launched as many as 1,127 strike incidents in the first nine months of last year, involving more than 392,000 workers, more than 20,000 more than in the same period in 1948 (Labour Department Magazine, October 1949).
    The Road for the British People
    The Labour Party's reactionary policy of relying on the dollar, preparing for war, seeking the interests of big capital, and suppressing the living standards of the working people has brought increasingly deep crises to Britain and will undoubtedly lead to huge and catastrophic consequences.
    Due to the characteristics of the post-war market (the huge demand for consumer goods and production equipment accumulated internationally and domestically during the war) and other favorable conditions (the temporary withdrawal of Germany and Japan from world market competition, the British productive forces not being significantly damaged, etc.), Britain's production has improved considerably in the years after the war, and therefore the proportion of unemployed people is smaller than in other Western European countries. But this temporary post-war "prosperity" phenomenon of capitalism is gradually becoming a thing of the past as the international market shrinks and the domestic people's purchasing power continues to decline. Last summer, London securities fell sharply; after June, some signs of stagnation have emerged in several production sectors. The number of unemployed people is already 400,000 to 500,000, and more workers will be laid off. It can be believed that after a while, all the evil consequences of the Labour Party's reactionary policies will be revealed, and major economic downturns and large-scale unemployment will be unavoidable. This is the reason why the Labour Party hurriedly decided to hold a general election five months before the end of its term. It wanted to seize the opportunity to continue serving big capital at 10 Downing Street before the people had time to see the government's huge military budget and feel all the evil consequences of the Labour Party's policies.
    Now, this political conspiracy of the Labour Party's right-wing leaders has once again achieved its goal. The Labour Party will further push Britain and the British people into the abyss of crisis. Attlee has indicated that his party will continue to implement the policies of the current government.
    But the British working people will inevitably come to the conclusion that the Labour Party, which serves big capital, and the Conservative Party of big capital are essentially "birds of a feather." Only the British Communist Party has unswervingly and stubbornly struggled for the cause of liberation of the British people for the past thirty years. Only by following the correct path pointed out by the British Communist Party, which has been proven by the entire history of the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries—the path of socialism—can we reach a truly free, independent, peaceful, and happy paradise. And the first stop on this road is: stop war preparations! End dependence on the United States!

　　就英国大选结果回顾工党政策
　　胡骑
    英国于本月二十三日举行了战后第二届议会选举。在这次选举中工党获得三百一十五席，比上届少七十九席，保守党获得二百九十四席，比上届多得一百零二席。这并非表示保守党比一九四五年更受英国人民的欢迎，而是说明英国人民已经开始怀疑艾德礼--贝文工党的欺骗宣传和伪善诺言。这一发展乃是执政的右翼工党领袖们四年半来一直执行反苏反人民政策的结果。
    在第二次世界大战后，从保守党的慕尼黑政策--这种政策几几乎招致了英国亡国的惨祸--和大规模失业中获得了痛苦经验的英国人民，渴望和平与安定的生活。他们在一九四五年七月战后第一次大选中有力地表示了他们这种愿望。英国劳动人民在选举中击败了以邱吉尔为首的代表大资本利益的保守党。工党以其动人的诺言赢得了下院大多数的席位。工党的右翼领袖们代保守党登台执政。但四年半的历史证明，右翼工党领导集团的种种漂亮诺言，诸如对苏“友好”，维护“世界和平”，给殖民地人民“民主自治”，“遏止”资本的权力，给工人以“美好的生活”之类，都无非是为了骗取选票。事实上，工党并没有变更保守党所规定的路线，而是在“集体安全”、“民主自治”、“国有化”、“混合经济”、“充分就业”等等词藻的掩盖之下，忠实地执行了追逐帝国主义利益的政策。
    反苏、反人民民主国家、反殖民地人民
    艾德礼政府上台不久，就开始暴露出它和邱吉尔保守党一样没有诚意建立英苏的友好关系；它所一心一意遵循的，乃是邱吉尔在富尔顿演说中所规划了的反苏路线。虽然苏联对于长期处于困迫中的英国人民的生活和英国工业，可以大量供给粮食和某些重要原料，虽然战后致力于恢复与建设工作的苏联，可以在互惠的基础上提供英国重要的出口货以广大市场，为反苏的阶级仇恨所驱使的工党右翼领袖们，却始终多方阻挠两国之间建立和发展友好及贸易的关系。在国内经济困难的逼迫和人民要求的压力之下，工党政府虽曾一次又一次地向苏联提议和谈判订结局部的贸易协定，但对于显然将十分有利于英国人民的长期贸易协定，却始终采取怠工的态度，使谈判一直毫无结果。不仅如此，工党政府首脑们还阻挠苏联在英国采购，并恣意污蔑苏联。自一九四七年接受了奴役性的马歇尔计划“援助”之后，工党政府遵照了美国帝国主义的意志，明令禁止许多重要出口货运往苏联及东欧的广大市场；并且追随美国反动派之后，发动所谓反苏“冷战”，参加组织各种以反苏反人民民主国家为目的的经济、政治与军事的侵略性集团，如“北大西洋公约”、“西欧联盟”、“欧洲委员会”、“欧洲合众国”运动、“社会党国际”，以及正在讨论中的“地中海公约”等等。在一切重大的国际会议上，工党政府的代表们是美国帝国主义者最卖力的伙伴。
    在执行帝国主义海外殖民和掠夺政策方面，工党的热心也屡次得到保守党的欢呼。工党在反法西斯战争已经结束之后，还长时期地保持了上百万人的庞大军队，对求自身独立和解放的殖民地及附属国人民进行残酷的镇压。在保皇法西斯血腥恐怖统治下的希腊人民永远记得英国帝国主义的罪恶。黄金海岸、厄立特里亚、尼日利亚等地的非洲人民，巴勒斯坦的犹太人和阿拉伯人，塞浦路斯的希腊正教徒，也不会忘记英国军队的“武威”。曾经自日本法西斯铁蹄下获得解放的英勇的马来亚人民，数年来一直受着英国殖民军的摧残。而印度大陆的印回人民也会痛苦地记得，是谁在“给你独立”的帷幕后面，不断制造着每年使数以万计的生命归于绝灭的大规模流血惨剧和饥馑。
    投靠美帝丧失经济自主权
    工党政府既然坚决执行反对苏联和镇压殖民地及附属国人民解放运动的政策，它就不能不投靠美国帝国主义，乞求于金元的“援助”。工党在一上任之后，就即刻与美国谈判签订了协定，为了三十七亿五千万美元的贷款（一九四六年七月），废弃帝国经济连锁的特惠制度，取消对于英镑兑换的管制，敞开美国资本侵入英镑区经济的大门。接着艾德礼政府又不顾人民的广泛反对，接受了奴役性的“马歇尔计划双边协定”（一九四八年七月），把英国经济的自主权也出卖给美国人。一九四七年初成立的关于保持战时英美联合参谋部的“军事合作协定”，去年四月间缔结的“北大西洋公约”，以及今年一月间签字的“北大西洋区域防御计划”协定等等，更使英国本土也成为美国准备侵略战争的屯兵场和供应基地。虽然美国帝国主义在战时和战后的不断扩张，在资本主义世界的各个角落与英国帝国主义的利益发生日益剧烈的冲突，虽然从欧洲大陆到南美，从中东到太平洋，自非英镑区以至英镑区，美国的资本和货物日益粗暴地排挤英帝国的势力，虽然英国帝国主义者在某些生命攸关的场合，也图作一些挣扎，但工党政府既然决定了采取依靠美元的总路线，英国只有愈来愈丧失其独立的地位而依附美国。在一切对外政策的重大问题上，工党和它的“反对党”--保守党一直如此协调，并不是偶然的。
    由于工党政府坚持依靠美元、坚持反对苏联的政策、坚持侵略的政策，成为英国战后经济困难的主要症结的国际收支危机，愈益严重。尽管一再削减所谓美元货入口，尽管饮鸩止渴地接受了数十亿美元的所谓“贷款”、“馈赠”或“援助”，整个英镑区的净入超仍自一九四六年全年的二亿二千六百万镑升至一九四九年上半年的二亿三千九百万镑；黄金及美元储备则自一九四六年底的六亿六千四百万镑，降至一九四九年六月底的四亿零六百万镑，九月中更降至三亿五千多万镑。就英国本部来说，据商务部最新的统计，今年一月份入超为一千九百六十万镑，年率仍达二亿三千五百万镑。整个英镑区美元的亏短，去年上半年达年率五亿二千八百万镑，其中英国本部占二亿三千万镑。尽管工党政府声嘶力竭地叫喊增加对美元区出口，英国对北美的出口却自一九四七年占英国出口总额的百分之八降至一九四九年第三季的百分之七。
    为大资本服务的“国有化”政策
    与对外的帝国主义政策不可分地关联在一起的，是工党在国内推行的反劳动人民的政策。在这里，工党甚至替大资本完成了某些为保守党所不易完成的服务。为了说明这一点，最好以工党所大吹大擂的所谓“国有化”为例。工党政府实施了七个工党“混合经济”理论下的所谓“国有化”的法案，包括煤矿、国内运输、电力、海外航空、煤气、电报和英格兰银行。它们丝毫没有改变资本主义的剥削制度。相反，蒙受其利的，不是劳动人民，而是大资本。工党政府把一些设备败坏和赔钱的企业部门，在名义上从资本家手中接收了过来，在“国有”的幌子下，支给了资本家远超过其原股额的所谓“补偿”，并且保证不论企业赢亏，仍给原业主以相当于以至数倍于他们所曾得过的利润。“国家”为此付出了数十亿取自劳动人民的金钱。而所有这些企业，都依旧操在原董事会或是伦敦“城”所委派的代表的手里。它们对于劳动人民所发生的唯一有实际意义的变化，是实际上剥夺了工人们进行谈判和罢工的权利。因为，据说，现在这些企业已是“国家”的企业，工人们不能损害“国家利益”。但迄今为止，即便是这种所谓“国有化”也还没有触及英国的枢纽工业--钢铁业以及一些大独占资本如化学和保险业，尤其是军火工业，因为这些企业现在还保有很高的利润，资本家不需要工党政府来代劳。
    工党的“国有化”就是这样一种巧妙的办法，它把资本家企业的亏蚀转嫁在劳动人民头上，保证资本家每年得到高额的利润，同时又免除他们与工人谈判的麻烦。从这里可以看到工党“国有化”的玄奥，也可以恍悟工党各种经济和社会政策的真谛。如果说工党政府的确实行了一些社会保险和国民保健之类的东西，那末人们不难设想，从每年取自劳动人民的数十亿镑收入中，拨出很少的一点点，施一些小惠，而以此大大标榜其所谓“福利国家”，在劳动群众中间散布对工党的幻觉，这对于工党的右翼首脑们，确是不化本钱的生意经。
    英镑贬值和“节约计划”
    工党政府为了进一步便利美元侵入和推进军备竞赛，于去年下半年又作出了严重地背叛英国劳动人民利益的两项决定：九月十八日宣布将英镑贬值，压低对美元的比值百分之三十；十月二十四日宣布所谓“节约”计划，大大削减生产性投资、房屋建筑及社会福利等费用。
    英镑贬值是工党顺从美元压力的直接结果。这个受到广泛谴责的决定是有利于向海外扩张的美国资本的，它更提高了美元对英镑区及与英镑相联的各地区的权威。贬值后美国用同样的美元可以收到比贬值前大得多的利益，而英国则必须以增加百分之四十以上的出口量始能换回贬值前同样数额的美元。这个决定同时自然也有利于英国的大资本，他们可以借此提高物价，从中取利；尤其是对于出口商，贬值后他们所赚到的每一美元，可以多换取两个半先令。连宣布这一贬值的工党政府的财政大臣克里浦斯自己也承认，这特别是加给工人的一个负担。但他隐藏了这一决定的最本质的意义，就是：这乃是对英国劳动人民生活水平的一个重大进攻。伦敦《经济学家》杂志的每周批发物价指数已经十分确定地表明了这个必然的趋势。自九月二十一日到十一月二十二日两个月中，指数共涨了十三点。事实上，面包的价格在克里浦斯宣布贬值的同时就宣布涨价三分之一。但是另一方面，根据政府的冻结工资政策，工人的工资却是不准增加的。
    至于所谓“节约”计划，乃是工党政府不顾人民死活，集中更大的力量从事侵略的军事准备的有力说明。艾德礼要求将非军事开支减少二亿五千万镑，其中一亿四千万镑是生产建设方面的费用，另外的一亿多镑则规定要从裁员、减薪及削减教育、卫生、农业等费用来补足。按照这个“节约”计划，英国战后迫切需要的房屋建筑，明年将较目前已经不到建造力之一半的数目，再减少二万五千所。许多学校及企业的建设及扩充计划将被取消，港口的修复工作将告延搁，一万公务员与成万工人将失去工作，食物津贴将大大削减。而所有这一切“节约”，为的只是把迄今支出已达九亿镑的一九四九--五○年度庞大军事费用（其中三分之一用于海外军事活动），在下年度再提高到十二亿镑。即相当于一九四八年全部国民收入的八分之一。
    劳动人民生活的恶化
    人们可以想见，在工党这种一心一意为大资本服务的政策下，劳动人民的景况是决不会得到真正改善的。事实证明，在战时已经大为恶化的劳动人民的生活，在工党的冒牌“社会主义”之下是更加恶化了。据官方的数字，零售物价自一九四七年六月到一九四九年九月上涨了百分之十二，其中占人民生活最重要部分的衣食两项各增加了百分之十九及十七，而同时期的工资率却只上升了百分之九（英劳工部杂志一九四九年十月号）。若与战前一九三八年比较，则到一九四九年第一季，批发物价指数涨了百分之一百一十八，而工资却只上升百分之九十二。这还是官方的数字，实际情况自然要比官方数字所承认的还要坏。与此同时，公司的利润却获得巨大增涨。据克里浦斯于去年四月公布的白皮书透露，从一九三八年到一九四九年第一季，整整涨了三倍有余。一九四八年资本家与地主的利息、利润和租金的收入占国民总收入的百分之四十一，在纳税之后，尚净余二十九亿二千二百万镑，数目等于全体工人全年工资收入的五分之四。对于这种收获，工党的政策在其中起了很照顾资本家的作用，例如自一九四六年到一九四八年，对利润的抽税，减少了八千万镑，对工资收入者的所得税及保险费的征收却增加了五千五百万镑，主要由劳动人民负担的间接税增加了五亿零二百万镑。劳动人民为自身的困苦而进行的罢工斗争的频繁，反映了他们生活恶化的深度。不顾职工大会右翼领导方面的反对，英国工人在去年头九个月里发动的罢工事件达一千一百二十七起之多，卷入工人三十九万二千余人，较一九四八年同时期多两万余人（劳工部杂志一九四九年十月号）。
    英国人民的道路
    工党依靠美元、准备战争、谋求大资本利益和压低劳动人民生活水平的反动政策，已经给英国带来了日益深重的危机，而且无疑地将招致巨大灾难性的后果。
    由于战后市场的特点（国际国内在战时积累下来的对于消费品及生产设备的巨大需求）及其他有利的条件（德、日的暂时退出世界市场竞争，英国生产力未受到重大破坏等），英国在战后几年的生产，曾有相当的提高，因而失业人数也比其他西欧国家的比例为小。但这种资本主义暂时的战后“景气”现象，随着国际市场的趋于缩小和国内人民购买力的不断下降，正渐渐成为过去。去年夏天，伦敦证券曾剧烈下跌；六月以后，若干生产部门已浮现某些停滞的迹象。失业的人数已有四五十万，而且更多的工人将被解雇。可以相信，再过一个时候，工党反动政策的全部恶果就将显露，重大的经济衰跌和大规模的失业就将不可避免。这正是工党匆匆决定在任期届满以前五个月就举行大选的缘故。它想在人民还来不及看到政府的庞大军事预算和感受到工党政策的全部恶果之前，取得继续在唐宁街十号为大资本服务的机会。
    现在，工党右翼领袖们的这个政治阴谋，又一次达到了目的。工党将进一步把英国和英国人民推入危机的深渊。艾德礼已经表示：他的党将继续执行本届政府的政策。
    但英国劳动人民必然会得出结论：为大资本服务的工党和大资本的保守党本质上是“一丘之貉”，只有英国共产党三十年来始终不移、顽强地为英国人民的解放事业而奋斗，只有顺着英国共产党所指引的、已经为苏联及人民民主国家的全部历史所证明了的正确道路--社会主义的道路，才能达到真正自由、独立、和平、幸福的乐土。而这条道路的头站就是：制止战争准备！结束依附美国！
