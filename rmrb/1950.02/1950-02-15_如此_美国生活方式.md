　　TASS, New York dispatch: Some time ago, former US Secretary of the Interior Ickes published a special article in "The New Republic" magazine, exposing some of the characteristics of the so-called "American way of life."

　　Ickes said, "It's really comfortable to be a Congressman."

　　The author's sarcastic remark was directed at John Parnell Thomas. As everyone knows, Thomas, who became notorious for being the chairman of the Un-American Activities Committee, was caught red-handed - he "registered" the names of his family members as employees of the federal secret service, fabricated false payrolls, and put the salaries that these "employees" deserved into his own pocket. This scandal caused a great uproar, and Thomas finally had to go to court. However, Thomas cannot complain that the American judicial authorities treated him unfairly. "If this political rogue was not a Congressman, the judge would not have been so kind to him, it's really lucky."

　　Thomas tried his best to delay the trial, while his wife and daughter-in-law continued to receive huge salaries from the federal treasury. Ickes said, "These salaries will be paid until Thomas' resignation takes effect... and after that, this convicted person can get a government pension."

　　Moreover, Thomas has taken care of the future of his family. Ickes said, "Thomas said on his way to jail that his wife would become a candidate and succeed him in Congress as his Congresswoman."

　　Ickes further said: Thomas's participation in the "legislative work" of the US Congress also helped this rogue, because Judge Holtzoff believed that the Un-American Activities Committee had made "many contributions," and he considered this a "condition for leniency" in the judicial aspect, so he was given a lighter sentence. Thomas was originally supposed to be sentenced to thirty-two years in prison and a fine of $40,000, but he was only sentenced to six months in prison and a fine of $10,000.

　　Ickes pointed out that Thomas's case is by no means the only one. Boston Mayor James Curley committed fraud when he was a Congressman and should have been sentenced to 47 years in prison and fined $19,000. In reality, he only served five years in prison, and even during his imprisonment, he still received a salary of $20,000 per year.

　　There is also Andrew May, who, when he was chairman of the House Military Affairs Committee, had received approximately $54,000 in bribes. However, Ickes pointed out that since the person on trial in court was a Congressman, he was treated very leniently and was only sentenced to two years in prison. The sentence was pronounced as early as 1947. But he did not actually enter prison until December 1949. Ickes predicted that May would be released soon.

　　Ickes concluded: "These examples prove that anyone who wants to seize money that does not belong to them or accept bribes... should first get himself elected as a Congressman."

### 如此“美国生活方式”

　　如此“美国生活方式”
    塔斯社纽约消息：前些时候，前美国内政部长伊克斯在《新共和》杂志上发表一篇专文，暴露所谓“美国生活方式”的某些特点。
    伊克斯说：“做国会议员真惬意”。
    作者这句讽刺的话是针对约翰·巴奈尔·汤马斯而发的。大家都知道，由于当了非美活动委员会主席而恶名昭彰的汤马斯，人赃俱在，被人查获了——他把他的家属的姓名都“报进”联邦特务机关当职员，捏造虚假的发薪单，把这些“职员”应得的薪水都放进自己的口袋。这件丑事闹得满城风雨，汤马斯终于不得不上法庭了。然而，汤马斯倒也不能埋怨美国司法当局薄待了他。“假如这位政治上的无赖汉不是国会议员的话，法官就不会待他如此客气了，真是运气。”
    汤马斯竭力使审判延宕时日，而他的妻子和媳妇继续从联邦财政部领到巨额薪水。伊克斯说，“这些薪水要一直支付到汤马斯辞呈生效……而在这以后，这个被判罪的人，可获得政府的退休金”。
    而且，汤马斯已把他的家属的未来都照料好了。伊克斯说，“汤马斯在赴狱途中说过：他的妻子当成为候补人而在国会中继任他的国会议员”。
    伊克斯进一步说：汤马斯之参加美国国会的“立法工作”，对这个流氓也有帮助，因为法官霍尔佐夫认为，非美活动委员会曾有“很多贡献”，而他把这一点认为是司法方面可以“减刑的条件”，因此从轻发落了。汤马斯本来应判三十二年监禁和四万美元罚款，结果只被判了六个月徒刑和一万美元罚款。
    伊克斯指出，汤马斯的案件决非仅有的唯一案件。波斯顿市长詹姆斯·寇莱，当国会议员时，犯了欺诈罪，本当被判四十七年徒刑和罚款一万九千美元。而实际上，他只服了五年徒刑，而且就在他服徒刑期间，每年还领到二万美元的薪水。
    还有一位安德烈·梅氏，他当众院军事委员会主席时，曾收受过约五万四千美元的贿赂。然而，伊克斯指出，法庭上受审的既然是位国会议员，就对他十分宽大，只判处两年徒刑。早在一九四七年就宣判了。可是实际上直到一九四九年十二月他才入狱。伊克斯预言，梅氏不久就会出狱。
    伊克斯在结语中说：“这些例子证明了，凡想攫取不属于自己的金钱、或收受贿赂的人…最好先使自己当选为国会议员。”
