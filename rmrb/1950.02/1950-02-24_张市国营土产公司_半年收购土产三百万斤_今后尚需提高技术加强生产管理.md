　　Zhangjiakou State-Owned Native Produce Company
    Acquires Three Million Jin of Native Produce in Half a Year
    Further Improvements in Technology and Production Management Needed
    [Our Newspaper] The Zhangjiakou branch of the State-Owned Native Produce Company has acquired over three million jin of native produce from farmers in the past six months, playing a significant role in developing urban-rural mutual aid and supporting rural sideline occupations. Since its establishment in June last year, the company, based on the native produce situation in Chahar Province, has successively established a branch company in Datong, temporary acquisition teams in Xiheying, Shacheng, Yingxian, Hunyuan, and other places, and a medicinal material processing factory in Hunyuan. In terms of business operations, in addition to signing acquisition contracts with the supply and marketing cooperatives of various counties and districts through ordering, purchasing on behalf, or cash transactions, the company has also obtained the cooperation and support of various specialized companies and banks. For example, when the Native Produce Company signed a contract with the Chicheng Supply and Marketing Cooperative in early December last year to acquire 50,000 jin of medicinal materials in exchange for millet, it consulted with and obtained the consent of the Provincial Grain Bureau, with the Native Produce Company paying the Zhangjiakou Grain Company at market prices, and the Xuanhua Grain Company delivering 75,000 jin of public grain to the Chahar South Grain Depot on behalf of Chicheng. This not only solved the difficulty of Chicheng's residents in paying public grain but also saved on grain transportation costs. Furthermore, the Chahar Provincial Bank, to facilitate the company's acquisition of native produce, established business relations with it for the allocation of funds and overdrafts, strengthening capital turnover. In places where supply and marketing cooperatives have not yet been established or in remote areas, the Native Produce Company gives appropriate profits to private merchants with experience in operating native produce, so that acquisition business can be carried out. In the case of medicinal materials alone, more than 2.3 million jin were acquired in half a year, worth more than 7.6 million jin of millet. The three disaster-stricken counties of Sihai, Chicheng, and Longguan accounted for half of this, solving the grain problem for 170,000 people for one month. Due to the development of native produce acquisition, not only was the exchange of materials between urban and rural areas promoted, but also the sideline production of the masses was driven, enabling farmers in disaster areas to engage in production for self-salvation. For example, Longguan and Chicheng counties have driven many women to participate in the selection, processing, and packaging of medicinal materials. The company has also acquired more than 90,000 jin of white hemp and nearly 700,000 jin of sulfur. Because burning sulfur requires a large number of porcelain jars and coal, ten porcelain kilns in the long-closed Daciyao Village in Hunyuan have restored five, and six kilns have also been restored in Pianguan, which can produce 2,400 jars per day. Twenty-six coal kilns have also been developed, producing 200 tons of charcoal per day.
    In the half-year of business operations, some deviations have also emerged. For example, when starting to acquire medicinal materials, due to a lack of understanding of sales channels and blind promotion, some medicinal materials could not find sales channels in time, resulting in the accumulation of funds. Another example is that sulfur production did not adequately help the masses solve technical problems, and the finished products did not meet the specifications, affecting sales. Furthermore, there have been instances of failure to fulfill contractual obligations when industrial products rise in price. In the future, in response to the above-mentioned shortcomings, it is first necessary to improve technology, strengthen production management, and implement a finished product inspection system to improve quality and facilitate export. It is also necessary to supply production raw materials in a planned way to develop sideline production and open up sales channels in order to achieve the goal of material exchange between urban and rural areas.

　　张市国营土产公司
    半年收购土产三百万斤
    今后尚需提高技术加强生产管理
    【本报讯】国营土产公司张家口分公司半年来收购农民土产达三百余万斤，对发展城乡互助，扶助农村副业，起了很大作用。该公司于去年六月成立后，根据察省土产情况，先后在大同成立了支公司，在西合营、沙城、应县、浑源等地设立了临时收购小组，并在浑源建立了药材加工工厂。在业务经营上，该公司除以订购、代购或现款交易的方式与各县、区供销社订立收购合同外，并取得了各专业公司与银行的配合和扶助。例如去年十二月上旬土产公司与赤城供销社订立以小米收购五万斤药材合同时，即商得省粮食局同意，由土产公司按市价给张市粮食公司付款，再由宣化粮食公司代赤城向察南粮库交公粮七万五千斤。这样不仅解决了赤城群众缴公粮的困难，且节省了运粮费用。又如察省银行为便利该公司收购土产，与之建立了调拨款项及透支的业务关系，加强了资金周转。在供销社尚未建立或偏僻的地方，土产公司则经过对经营土产有经验的私商给以适当利润，使收购业务得以开展。就药材一项，半年中即收购了二百三十余万斤，价值小米七百六十余万斤。其中四海、赤城、龙关三受灾县占一半，解决了十七万人一月的粮食。由于收购土产业务的开展，不但沟通了城乡物资交流，并带动了群众副业生产，使灾区农民得以生产自救。如龙关、赤城二县就带动了不少妇女参加了药材的拣选、加工、包装等工作。该公司又曾收购白麻九万余斤，硫磺近七十万斤。由于烧磺需用大量磁坛和煤炭，使歇业已久的浑源大磁窑村十座磁窑恢复了五座，偏关也恢复了六座，每日可烧坛二千四百个。煤窑也发展了二十六座，日产炭二百吨。
    半年业务经营中，也呈现了某些偏向。如开始收购药材时，由于不了解销路，盲目宣传，结果使某些药材不能及时找到销路，积压了资金。又如硫磺生产因没有很好帮群众解决技术问题，成品不合规格，影响销路。再如工业品上涨时，有发生不能完成合同义务的现象。今后应针对上述缺点，首先需提高技术，加强生产管理，实行成品检验制度，以提高质量，利于输出。并需有计划地供给生产原料发展副业生产，打开销路，以达到城乡物资交流的目的。
