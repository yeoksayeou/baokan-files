　　Tianjin No. 1 and No. 3 Textile Factories
    Neglect Sanitary Facilities
    Labor, Textile, and Health Ministries Decide to Send Personnel to Tianjin for Inspection and to Draft Improvement Measures.
    [This Newspaper] The serious situation of Tianjin textile factories violating factory hygiene requirements has attracted the attention of the Ministry of Labor of the Central People's Government. In order to improve the sanitary conditions of these factories, the Ministry of Labor has consulted with relevant departments of the Central People's Government and formulated several measures to deal with this issue.
    The issue of improving the sanitary facilities of Tianjin textile factories was raised by Li Lisan, Minister of Labor, after his recent visits to Tianjin No. 1 and No. 3 Textile Factories. Many workers in these two factories are sick, with two to three hundred people per factory falling ill each day, which is almost five to ten percent of the total number of workers in each factory. The investigation proved that the main reason for the workers' illnesses was not, as the military representatives and factory directors said, "due to overwork," but due to the poor sanitary facilities. The most common illness among workers is the common cold, which is because the toilets do not have heating equipment, and the temperature is the same as outdoors. Some toilets not only lack heating equipment but also have open skylights. Some, although not skylights, have latrines that are connected to the outside of the wall and are not covered with wooden boards. Some toilets have neither tap water for flushing nor are they cleaned frequently, making them extremely dirty. The six hundred workers in the opening and spinning rooms of the No. 3 factory only have nine latrines, and workers sometimes have to wait in the cold toilet for half an hour to relieve themselves. Therefore, when workers go from high-temperature workshops to cold toilets, they are very susceptible to catching colds. Other violations of factory hygiene requirements include: dirty kitchens and canteens, extremely unclean tables; the No. 1 factory's canteen does not even have plates for holding steamed buns, and the buns are placed on unclean dining tables. In addition, all the rice bowls are washed in one bucket, without tap water flushing, and without clean hand-washing facilities, making it very easy to spread diseases; the factory clinic does not have a gynecologist, and since most of the workers are female, the medical treatment of women's diseases is greatly affected; the workshop floors are not swept clean, making it easy for workers to slip and fall, and so on.
    In order to improve factory hygiene and cleanliness conditions, the Ministry of Labor of the Central People's Government has consulted with the Ministry of Textile Industry and the Ministry of Health and decided:
    1. A factory hygiene inspection team will be formed, consisting of two people from the Ministry of Textile Industry of the Central People's Government, one person from the Ministry of Labor, one person from the Ministry of Health, one person from the Textile Trade Union, one person from the Tianjin Textile Bureau, one person from the Tianjin Health Bureau, one person from the Tianjin Federation of Trade Unions, and one person from the Tianjin Textile Workers' Union, with Zhang Qinqiu, Deputy Minister of Textile Industry, as the leader, responsible for inspecting the hygiene conditions of the seven textile factories in Tianjin, drafting specific improvement measures, and then jointly instructing their implementation by the Ministry of Textile Industry and the Ministry of Labor of the Central People's Government.
    2. The Ministry of Health of the Central People's Government will designate Tianjin as one of the four factory health care experimental zones in 1950, starting with textile factories first.
    3. Promulgate a factory hygiene regulation. The draft of this regulation will first be sent to enterprise management agencies and trade union organizations for study and revision, and then submitted by the Ministry of Labor to the State Council for approval and promulgation.

　　天津中纺一厂三厂
    忽视工厂卫生设备
    劳动、纺织、卫生三部决派员赴津检查，拟具改善办法。
    【本报讯】天津纺织工厂违反工厂卫生要求的严重情况，引起了中央人民政府劳动部的注意，为改善这些工厂的卫生条件，劳动部已与中央人民政府有关部门进行会商，并订出了处理此一问题的几项办法。
    改善天津纺织工厂的卫生设施问题，是劳动部部长李立三在最近访问天津中纺一厂和三厂后所提出的。这两个工厂工人中生病的很多，每天每厂有两三百人，几等于各该厂工人总数百分之五到百分之十。考查的结果证明，工人患病的主要原因，并不是如军事代表和厂长所说“由于劳累过度”，而是卫生设备太坏。工人所患的病以感冒为最多，这是因为厕所没有暖气设备，温度与室外一样。有的厕所不仅没有暖气设备，而且天窗洞开。有的虽不是天窗，而便坑却通于墙外，并无木板覆盖。有的厕所既无自来水冲洗，又不勤于收拾，十分肮脏。而三厂的清花间与细纱间的六百名工人，只有九个便坑，工人解手，有时非在冷厕所等候半小时不可。所以当工人从高温的车间上冷厕所时，极易受寒。此外的违反工厂卫生要求的情形，还有：厨房、食堂肮脏，桌子极不洁净，一厂的食堂连盛馍的盘子也没有，馍馍放在不洁净的饭桌上，此外，所有的饭碗在一个桶里洗，没有自来水冲，没有洗手的清洁设备，极易传染疾病；工厂医疗所没有妇科医生，而工人又多系女工，妇女病的医疗就大受影响；车间地板不打扫清洁，易使工人滑倒跌伤等。
    为改善工厂卫生清洁条件，中央人民政府劳动部现已与纺织工业部和卫生部会商决定：
    一、组成工厂清洁卫生检查组，由中央人民政府纺织工业部二人、劳动部一人、卫生部一人、纺织总工会一人、天津纺织局一人、天津卫生局一人、天津市总工会一人、天津纺织工会一人组成，以纺织工业部副部长张琴秋为组长，负责检查天津中纺七个工厂的卫生状况，拟出具体改善办法，然后由中央人民政府纺织工业部和劳动部共同指令执行。
    二、由中央人民政府卫生部指定天津为一九五○年四个工厂卫生保健实验区之一，并先从纺织工厂着手。
    三、颁布一个工厂卫生条例。该条例将先以草案发到企业管理机关与工会组织中加以研究修改，然后由劳动部呈请政务院批准颁布。
