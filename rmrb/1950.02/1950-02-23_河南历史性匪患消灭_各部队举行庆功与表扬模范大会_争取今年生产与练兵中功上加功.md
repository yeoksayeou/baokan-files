Xinhua News Agency, Kaifeng, February 21st: After the basic completion of bandit suppression work, all bandit suppression units in Henan Province have successively held celebration conferences to commend heroes and model workers. The People's Liberation Army field armies and Henan Military Region main force units, as well as the people's armed forces of various military sub-districts, participating in the bandit suppression work in Henan, have vigorously promoted the fine traditions of hard struggle and strict discipline of the People's Liberation Army in the past year while carrying out bandit suppression tasks. They also used the gaps in bandit suppression operations to carry out mass work and launch movements such as troop production and assisting farmers in cultivation, thoroughly implementing Chairman Mao's and Commander-in-Chief Zhu's instructions to "always be both a fighting force and a working force." They have received enthusiastic support and assistance from the broad masses of the people, enabling the historical banditry in Henan to be quickly eliminated.

During the process of completing the bandit suppression task, a large number of people's heroes and model units emerged in various units. In the seven military sub-districts of Huangchuan and Shanzhou alone, there were 1,039 bandit suppression heroes and models, and 41 collective merit-earning units such as model squads, platoons, and companies. For example, Fu Zimiao, a combat model of the Jingfu County Brigade, killed, wounded, and captured more than 50 bandits with one platoon in the Dabie Mountains bandit suppression campaign. In the end, he led a squad to directly attack the Zhangjiawan bandit nest and captured the bandit leader "Killer Yama" Zhang Yaowu alive. Another example is Yang Baocheng, a cook from the first company of the Guangshan County Brigade, who, in addition to boiling water and cooking rice every day, also reclaimed eight acres of wasteland to grow vegetables. He supplied all 9,000 kilograms of vegetables harvested to the troops, which greatly improved the company's food.

At the celebration and model commendation conferences in various places, the unit leaders personally presented flowers to these bandit suppression heroes to congratulate them and encouraged them to make greater achievements and continue to maintain the glorious title of people's heroes in the 1950 troop production and military training movement. The heroes actively responded to the call of their superiors at the conference and formulated various specific plans to launch challenge competitions with each other. Some soldiers who had not made contributions expressed that they would definitely strive to make contributions to the people in the 1950 production and military training movement.
