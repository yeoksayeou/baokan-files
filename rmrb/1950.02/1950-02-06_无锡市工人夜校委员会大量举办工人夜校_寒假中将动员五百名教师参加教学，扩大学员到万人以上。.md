　　Wuxi City Workers' Night School Committee
    Massively Launches Workers' Night Schools
    500 Teachers to be Mobilized for Teaching During Winter Vacation, Expanding Enrollment to Over 10,000 Students.
    [Report from this newspaper] Sunan News: The Wuxi City Workers' Night School Committee recently decided to massively launch workers' night schools during the winter vacation. The plan is to increase the number of workers' night schools in the city from 56 to 100, and expand the number of students from 3,600 to over 10,000. At the same time, it will continue to strengthen and improve the original night schools. Those with conditions for expansion should be expanded. For example, the morning and night school of Shenxin No. 3 Factory originally had only over 200 students, but now it has expanded to over 1,000; the enrollment rate in night schools of Xingye, Tongyu and other cloth factories has reached over 90% of the total number of workers in the factory. The task for the future is to regularize them. If the original night schools lack teachers, the Night School Committee can be responsible for helping to solve the problem.
    In the past, many factories in Wuxi had not established night schools; and the night schools that had been established often experienced class suspensions because most of the cadres and teachers were held by trade union cadres who were busy with other work. Last December, initiated by the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, and jointly organized with the Propaganda Department of the Municipal Party Committee, the Municipal Education Bureau, the Education Union, and the Student Union, the Workers' Night School Committee was formed. The purpose was to promote all relevant parties to improve workers' education and correct the past shortcomings of simply running night schools by the trade union. Since its establishment, the committee has, on the one hand, cooperated with the Education Union to promote teachers throughout the city—especially primary school teachers—to participate in night school teaching work (500 teachers can be mobilized to participate during the winter vacation); on the other hand, it has promoted trade unions in various industries to mobilize workers to enroll. In addition to industrial workers, it is now also mobilizing porters, handicraft workers, and shop assistants. At the same time, the Night School Committee is conducting zoning to understand the situation, investigating the original night schools, drawing on experience, and drafting night school regulations to strengthen the leadership of night schools and unify the steps of each night school.
    Currently, some primary school teachers and students from Wuxi Education Institute have already begun to participate in night school work. After the winter vacation, the work of workers' night schools will be widely launched.

　　无锡市工人夜校委员会
    大量举办工人夜校
    寒假中将动员五百名教师参加教学，扩大学员到万人以上。
    【本报讯】苏南消息：无锡市工人夜校委员会顷决定在寒假中大量开办工人夜校。计划把全市工人夜校由五十六所增至一百所，学员人数由三千六百人扩大到万人以上。同时，继续加强与提高原有夜校，有条件扩大的要扩大起来，如申新三厂的晨夜校，原来只有二百多学员，现已扩大到一千多人；兴业、同余等布厂夜校名额已占全厂工人总数的百分之九十以上，今后的任务是要使它走向正规化。原有夜校缺少师资的，夜校委员会可以负责帮助解决。
    过去无锡市好些工厂未办夜校；而已成立的夜校，又因干部与教师绝大部分由工会干部担任，因为他们忙于别的工作，停课现象时常发生。去年十二月，由市总工会发起，与中共市委宣传部、市教育局、教联和学联等单位共同组织了工人夜校委员会，目的是把有关方面都推动起来，把工人教育提高一步，改正过去单纯地由工会办夜校的缺点。该会成立以来，一方面配合教联推动全市教师——特别是小学教师参加夜校教学工作（寒假期中可动员五百教师参加）；另方面推动各业工会动员工人入学，除产业工人外，现并动员搬运工人、手工业工人和店员等。同时，夜校委员会正进行分区了解情况，调查原有夜校，吸取经验，起草夜校简章，以加强夜校领导，统一各夜校步骤。
    现在一部分小学教师和无锡教育学院的部分学生已开始参加夜校工作。寒假后工人夜校工作即将普遍展开。
