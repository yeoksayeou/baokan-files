Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, February 24th: Over 100,000 people from all ethnic groups and sectors in Xi'an City held a grand rally at noon on the 23rd to celebrate the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance, and Mutual Assistance. The venue was packed with people, filled with the sounds of锣鼓(gongs and drums), and fluttering red flags. After the chairman of the大会(rally), Xi'an Deputy Mayor Fang Zhongru, briefly explained the great significance of the conclusion of the new Sino-Soviet treaty, he called on the people of Xi'an to step up production, work hard on construction, and welcome the Sino-Soviet alliance. Xi Zhongxun, Vice Chairman of the Northwest Military and Political Committee, emphasized in his speech that the signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance, and Mutual Assistance opened a new era of Sino-Soviet friendly cooperation. It has added limitless strength to consolidating the Far East and the world peace front; at the same time, it has severely struck the arrogant behavior of American imperialist war-mongers attempting to support the resurgence of Japanese imperialism and provoke a third world war. He said: Our people, after victory, can obtain brotherly assistance from the Soviet Union, which will guarantee the consolidation of their own victory and the construction of a new China. In particular, the Northwest borders the Soviet Union, a friendly country. With such kind and profound friendly assistance, we will be able to rapidly heal the wounds of war and restore and develop production. Following him, Li Zhimin, Political Commissar of the 19th Army Corps of the People's Liberation Army, Ma Pingfu, representative of the Hui people of Xi'an, Zhao Zhankui, a labor hero, as well as representatives of peasants and women, spoke. They unanimously expressed their firm support for the call of Vice Chairman Xi and Deputy Mayor Fang to launch the study of Soviet experience in various production departments to build the great Northwest. Finally, the大会(rally) unanimously passed a telegram to Chairman Mao, expressing firm support for the new Sino-Soviet treaty. After the meeting, countless秧歌(Yangge) teams,腰鼓(waist drum) teams, and高跷(stilt) teams performed everywhere. Streets and alleys were crowded with people celebrating this joyful holiday following the founding of the country.
