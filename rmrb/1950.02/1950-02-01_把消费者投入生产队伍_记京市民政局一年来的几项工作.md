Putting Consumers into the Production Force
    — A Record of Several Tasks Undertaken by the Beijing Municipal Civil Affairs Bureau in the Past Year

    In the early days of Beijing's liberation, the number of consumer population in the city was enormous. According to rough estimates, about 700,000 out of the city's two million people were consumers at that time. Among these consumers, besides a portion of retired civil and military officials and fugitive landlords and their families, the majority were farmers, unemployed workers, and unemployed intellectuals who had drifted to Beijing under the reactionary rule. Before Beijing's liberation, they had already become urban poor, and some had even become beggars and prostitutes. In addition, some families of martyrs, soldiers, and cadres mainly relied on government relief in the early days of Beijing's liberation.

    Under the policy of transforming the consumer city into a production city, the Beijing Municipal Civil Affairs Bureau has concentrated its greatest efforts over the past year, using methods such as mobilizing people to return to their hometowns for production, organizing immigration, organizing labor brigades, organizing various labor productions, and introducing employment, to transfer a large number of consumers into the production force.

    In the early days of liberation, through propaganda and education, a large number of fugitive landlords and old military and political personnel and their families were mobilized to return to their hometowns to participate in production. At the same time, the government also assisted some students and farmers who had fled to Beijing before liberation to return to their original places to resume their studies or businesses. At that time, about 200,000 of Beijing's consumer population returned to their hometowns to participate in production.

    After August last year, the Civil Affairs Bureau implemented the resolution of the First Beijing Municipal People's Representative Conference and continued to mobilize citizens who could return to their hometowns to participate in production on a voluntary basis. Among them, a total of 1,004 households, comprising 3,328 people, received subsidies for train tickets, food expenses, or were issued return-to-hometown certificates by the Civil Affairs Bureau. In addition, 1,132 households, comprising 2,753 people, returned to their hometowns on their own initiative and received subsidies for train tickets and food expenses from the Civil Affairs Bureau.

    In addition to mobilizing a large number of citizens from rural areas to return to their hometowns to participate in production, the Beijing Municipal Civil Affairs Bureau also mobilized a total of 419 households, comprising 1,168 unemployed workers, disaster-stricken farmers, and urban poor, to migrate to Chahar North and Suiyuan in October last year to engage in agricultural production such as land reclamation. Before their departure, the district offices of each district respectively concentrated the heads of immigrant households, conducted short-term education, strengthened their confidence in settling down and establishing businesses in Chahar and Suiyuan, and the government provided all travel expenses. After they arrived in Chahar and Suiyuan, they received the cordial care of the local government, were allocated land and houses, and were lent food, livestock, farm implements, and clothing, and enthusiastically began their production work. At the beginning of the New Year this year, they wrote letters back to Beijing, thanking the People's Government for their help.

    In October last year, simultaneously with the immigration to Chahar and Suiyuan, the Civil Affairs Bureau introduced 320 unemployed intellectuals to serve as middle and primary school teachers in Hebei, Chahar, Suiyuan, Inner Mongolia, and other places where teachers were relatively scarce; at the same time, it introduced 634 unemployed workers to work in the Fushun coal mine.

    For beggars wandering on the streets, a total of 3,703 people were taken in throughout the year. After they were taken into the production and education institute, their awareness was gradually enlightened through methods such as complaining and discussion, and after establishing the concept of labor, they were dealt with separately: over the past year, 1,498 people were sent back to their hometowns to participate in production and were discharged from the institute for employment; 694 people were organized into labor brigades and went to the Yellow River, Chahar, and Inner Mongolia to engage in dike repair, land reclamation, and logging; 112 people were taken in at the headquarters of the production and education institute and were already engaged in printing, weaving, and other labor production, and were able to support themselves; 1,601 people were taken in at the old-age homes, women's education institutes, and poor people's handicraft workshops, and except for the old, weak, and disabled, the remaining 484 people participated in production work such as spinning wool, making shoe soles, and pasting matchboxes. The 469 young beggars taken in at the nurseries have already begun regular primary school education.

    After the Beijing Municipal Second People's Representative Conference passed the resolution to close all brothels in the city on November 21 last year, the Beijing Municipal People's Government completed the work of closing all 224 brothels in the city within twelve hours, established the Women's Production and Education Institute, and took in 1,268 prostitutes. In addition to carrying out the work of transforming their thinking, they were also treated for sexually transmitted diseases. This group of new women will also be put into the production force.

    In the early days of Beijing's liberation, thousands of petty thieves and pickpockets remained in the city, endangering social order. Most of these people have been rounded up by the Public Security Bureau and transferred to the People's Court to be educated and reformed through long-term labor.

    According to surveys in July and August last year, there were a total of 2,001 monks, nuns, Taoists, Taoist nuns, lamas, and eunuchs in the city. They have long been divorced from labor production, engaged in superstitious and other backward occupations, and generally have strong parasitic ideas. Over the past year, due to the active education and assistance of the Civil Affairs Bureau, most of them have begun to change their views on life and have initially established the concept of labor. The vast majority have participated in production, of which 106 have voluntarily returned to secular life and changed careers, and 15 have participated in work after studying at China University, Revolutionary University, and Military University; in addition, 10 temples have formed formal production units, and about 100 monks, Taoists, nuns, etc. have participated in this organized production activity, and the rest have mostly participated in production such as sewing socks, making shoe soles, and pasting matchboxes.

    The number of families of martyrs, soldiers, and cadres in Beijing is very large, with a total of 13,668 households and 52,519 people. The vast majority of them are poor and unemployed. Before August last year, because education work had not yet been deepened and the work of organizing production had not yet been carried out, many families of martyrs, soldiers, and cadres had the idea of relying on government relief. After August, the districts generally conducted education for them on "It is glorious to be a family member of a martyr, soldier, or cadre, and it is even more glorious to labor and produce." The Civil Affairs Bureau also cooperated with the Municipal Women's Federation and the Municipal Cooperative General Society to strengthen leadership organization and production work. The political awareness of the families of martyrs, soldiers, and cadres has generally improved, and they have actively started production work. Taking the Third District as an example, the percentage of families of martyrs, soldiers, and cadres requesting government relief was 55% in March, but it had decreased to 18% by December. Now the number of people enjoying preferential treatment in the city has been reduced to 23,538, and the rest have mostly participated in labor production. Among them, 959 people have been introduced to employment by the Civil Affairs Bureau; 1,663 people have participated in short-term work; 158 households, comprising 519 people, have been sent back to their hometowns to participate in production; and a total of 1,882 people are regularly engaged in production such as weaving socks, spinning wool, sewing, bleaching cotton, and manufacturing non-staple food in various places in the city. In addition, more than 2,000 women have been organized to participate in short-term paving and washing work.

    There are 499 honorary soldiers and 217 demobilized soldiers who have gloriously returned to Beijing from the front lines of the People's Liberation War. Except for the old, weak, and disabled, most of them have been transferred to the production force, and 255 of them have been introduced to work by the Civil Affairs Bureau. In addition, the Civil Affairs Bureau has established a small factory to assist them in participating in production.

    After a year of efforts, the consumer population in Beijing has been greatly reduced, but because production has not yet been fully restored and developed, the unemployment problem still cannot be completely solved. Therefore, how to strengthen the work of organizing labor production from existing experience, and how to further destroy parasitic ideas and hedonistic ideas among the broad masses of citizens, so as to continue to reduce the consumer population, is still a major issue. The Beijing Municipal Civil Affairs Bureau has included it in the 1950 work plan and is preparing to gradually solve it.

　　把消费者投入生产队伍
    ——记京市民政局一年来的几项工作
    北京解放初期全市消费人口的数字十分庞大，据粗略估计：当时全市二百万人口中约有七十万消费人口。这些消费人口中，除一部是过去的退职文武官员，逃亡地主及其家属外，大部都是在反动统治下流浪北京的农民、失业工人和失业知识分子。他们在北京解放以前已经成为城市贫民，有的且已沦为乞丐、妓女。此外还有一部分烈、军、干属在北京解放初期也主要依靠政府的救济。
    京市人民政府民政局在变消费城市为生产城市的方针下，一年来集中了最大力量，用动员还乡生产、组织移民、组织劳动大队、组织各种劳动生产与介绍就业等方式，使大量消费人口转入生产队伍中。
    在解放初期，经过宣传教育，动员了大批逃亡地主，旧的军政人员及其家属陆续还乡参加生产，同时政府又协助了在北京解放前流亡来京的部分学生与农民返回原地复学或复业，当时京市消费人口中还乡参加生产的约有二十万人。
    去年八月以后，民政局执行北京市第一届各界人民代表会议的决议，继续动员可能还乡参加生产的市民在自愿原则下返回原籍参加生产。其中经民政局补助车票、伙食费或发给还乡证的共一千零四户，三千三百二十八人。此外市民自动返乡经民政局补助车票与伙食费的有一千一百三十二户，二千七百五十三人。
    除了大量动员来自农村的市民回到原籍参加生产外，京市民政局在去年十月又动员了失业工人、受灾农民、城市贫民共四百十九户，一千一百六十八人迁移察北和绥远从事垦荒等农业生产。临行前，各区区公所分别集中移民户户主，进行了短期教育，加强他们去察绥安家立业的信心，并由政府发给了全部旅费。他们到达察绥后，受到当地政府的亲切照顾，分得了土地、房屋，贷到了食粮、牲畜、农具和衣服，热烈地开始了生产工作。今年新年时，他们纷纷写信回京，感谢人民政府对他们的帮助。
    去年十月，与移民察绥同时，民政局介绍了三百二十个失业知识分子，分赴师资比较缺少的河北、察哈尔、绥远、内蒙等地担任中、小学教员；同时介绍了失业工人六百三十四人前往抚顺煤矿作工。
    对于流浪街头的乞丐，全年共收容了三千七百零三人。把他们收容到生产教养院，经过诉苦、讨论等方式逐步启发其觉悟，树立劳动观念后，即分别进行处理：一年来遣送还乡参加生产及出院就业的有一千四百九十八人；编成劳动大队，分赴黄河、察哈尔与内蒙从事修堤、开垦与伐木等工作的有六百九十四人；收容在生产教养院总部的一百一十二人，已从事印刷、机织等劳动生产，能够生活自给；收容在安老所、妇女教养院与贫民习艺所的一千六百零一人，除老弱残废外，其余四百八十四人都分别参加了纺毛、纳鞋底、糊火柴盒等生产工作。收容在育幼所的幼年乞丐四百六十九人，已经开始正规的小学教育。
    去年十一月二十一日，北京市第二届各界人民代表会议通过了封闭全市妓院的决议后，京市人民政府在十二小时内完成了封闭全市妓院二百二十四家的工作，成立了妇女生产教养院，收容了妓女一千二百六十八人，除对她们进行改造思想的工作外，并为她们医治性病，这批新生妇女也将投入生产队伍中。
    北京解放初期，市内还残留着数以千计的小偷扒手，为害社会秩序，这些人已大部由公安局搜捕后转送人民法院，开始从长期劳动中加以教育、改造。
    据去年七、八月份调查：全市共有和尚、尼姑、道士、道姑、喇嘛、太监等二千零一人，他们长期脱离劳动生产，从事迷信等落后的职业，普遍存在着浓厚的寄生思想。一年来由于民政局的积极教育与协助，他们大多已开始转变了对人生的看法，初步树立了劳动观念，绝大部分已参加生产，其中自动还俗转业的有一百零六人，在华大、革大与军大学习后，参加工作的有十五人；此外已有十个寺、庙组成了正式的生产单位，参加这种有组织的生产活动的僧道、尼姑等约一百人，其余的也大部都参加了缝袜子、纳鞋底、糊火柴盒等生产。
    北京市烈、军、干属数字很大，共有一万三千六百六十八户，五万二千五百十九人。其中贫苦无职业的占绝大多数。去年八月以前，由于教育工作尚未深入，组织生产的工作尚未展开，所以，不少烈、军、干属存在着依赖政府救济的思想。八月以后，各区对他们普遍进行了“烈、军、干属光荣，劳动生产更光荣”的教育，民政局又会同市妇联、市合作总社加强了领导组织与生产的工作，烈、军、干属政治觉悟普遍提高，积极开始生产工作。以第三区为例，要求政府救济的烈、军、干属，三月份时有百分之五十五，到十二月份时，已减至百分之十八。现在全市享受优待的已减到二万三千五百三十八人，其余大多参加了劳动生产，其中经民政局介绍就业的有九百五十九人；参加短期工作的有一千六百六十三人，遣送回籍参加生产的有一百五十八户，五百十九人；在市内各处经常从事织袜、纺毛、缝纫、漂棉、制造副食等生产的共一千八百八十二人。此外还组织了二千多妇女参加了短期的铺、拆洗工作。
    从人民解放战争前线光荣地回到北京的荣誉军人有四百九十九人，退伍军人二百十七人。除老弱残废外，大部已转入生产队伍中，其中经民政局介绍参加工作的已有二百五十五人。此外并由民政局创办了小型工厂一处，协助他们参加生产。
    经过一年来的努力，北京市的消费人口已经大大减少，但是由于生产尚未全部恢复与发展，失业问题仍然不可能全部解决。因此，如何从现有经验中加强组织劳动生产的工作，如何在广大市民中进一步摧毁寄生思想与享乐思想，以便继续减少消费人口，这仍然是一个重大问题。京市民政局已把它列入一九五○年工作计划中，准备逐步加以解决。
