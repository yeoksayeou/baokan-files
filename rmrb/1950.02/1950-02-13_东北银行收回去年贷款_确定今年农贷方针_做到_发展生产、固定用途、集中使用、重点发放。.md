Xinhua News Agency, Beijing - The Northeast Bank is now systematically recovering agricultural loans issued last year in order to more effectively reinvest these loans in this year's agricultural production. From the spring plowing to the summer weeding period last year, the Northeast Bank issued a total of over 600 billion yuan (Northeast currency), equivalent to approximately 120,000 tons of grain. These loans played a significant role in supporting agricultural production in various regions. During the spring plowing period, the bank issued a total of 405.8 billion yuan in loans, effectively assisting over 600,000 farming households in more than 10,400 villages in resolving difficulties with production materials. For example, farmers in various regions used loans to purchase over 52,000 head of livestock, increasing cultivated land by over 2.6 million mu. The bank's issuance of over 3,000 tons of fertilizer loans resulted in an increased grain production of approximately 32,000 tons. In addition, the 2,000 sets of foreign plows, 2,000 carts, and over 40,000 other farm implements, along with 44.7 million jin of seeds, food grain, and fodder, enabled even severely drought-stricken new areas to plant crops on schedule. Spring plowing loans also played a significant role in restoring and developing industrial crops. The Northeast Bank issued a large quantity of cotton seeds, resolving the planting needs for 260,000 mu of cotton fields in twenty counties; it also issued tussah silkworm loans, resolving the silkworm egg needs for sixteen counties, increasing the production of silkworm silk by over 2 million jin. In addition, the Northeast Bank also issued loans for fruit trees, tobacco, hemp, peanuts, and other crops. During the summer weeding period, when some areas in provinces such as Liaoxi were experiencing a food shortage due to the gap between harvests, the Northeast Bank immediately issued loans of over 84 billion yuan to the area, promptly helping farmers resolve their food and fodder difficulties. When some areas in provinces such as Liaoxi, Rehe, and Heilongjiang were affected by hailstorms and needed to replant late-maturing crops, the Northeast Bank lent out 1.35 million jin of seeds, enabling 160,000 mu of land to be replanted.

　　东北银行收回去年贷款
    确定今年农贷方针
    做到“发展生产、固定用途、集中使用、重点发放。”
    【新华社北京电】东北银行现正有计划地将去年发放的农业贷款收回，以便更有效地把这些贷款再投入今年的农业生产中。去年东北银行自春耕至夏锄期间，先后共发放了农业贷款六千余亿元（东北币，下同），折合粮食约十二万吨。这些贷款对扶助各地农业生产起了重大的作用。在春耕期间，该行共发放贷款四千零五十八亿元，有力地帮助了一万另四百余个村的六十余万户农民，解决生产资料的困难。如各地农民以贷款购置的牲畜就有五万二千余头，增耕土地达二百六十余万亩。该行发放的三千余吨肥料贷款，使粮食增产了约达三万二千余吨。另外贷出的两千付洋犁、两千辆大车和四万余件其他的农具，还有四千四百七十万斤的种子、食粮、马料等，使某些春荒严重的新区，也都能如期种上了作物。春耕贷款在恢复与发展工业作物上也有很大作用。东北银行发放了大批棉籽，解决了二十个县二十六万余亩棉田的种植；也发放了柞蚕贷款，解决了十六个县的蚕种需要，增产了蚕丝两百余万斤。此外，东北银行还发放了果树、烟麻、花生等贷款。夏锄期间，当辽西等省若干地区因青黄不接，缺乏食粮和马料时，东北银行即发放给该区贷款八百四十余亿元，及时帮助农民解决了食粮和马料的困难。当辽西、热河、黑龙江等省的某些地区因受雹灾，需要补种晚作物时，东北银行即贷出种子一百三十五万斤，使十六万亩土地得到补种。
