　　First Annual Meeting of the Michurin Society to be Held in Beijing the Day After Tomorrow
    [By Our Correspondent] The Michurin Society has decided to hold its first annual meeting at the Agricultural University in the western suburbs of Beijing on the 18th and 19th. In addition to representatives from the society's branches in various regions, representatives from relevant organizations and agricultural experts in Beijing, there will also be farmer representatives from Shijiazhuang and more than ten labor heroes and model agricultural workers from various regions. At the meeting, experiences from various regions will be exchanged, advanced agricultural scientific knowledge will be promoted, and the strengthening of the society's organization will be discussed, with a view to carrying out a nationwide Michurin movement. The Michurin Society was founded in the spring of 1949, with its headquarters initially located in the Agricultural College of North China University in Shijiazhuang. Later, the Agricultural College of North China University merged with the Agricultural College of Peking University and the Agricultural College of Tsinghua University to form the Agricultural University. The Michurin Society then moved to the Agricultural University in the western suburbs of Beijing. The society is composed of agricultural scientific workers and rural practical workers. It is based on materialist dialectics and takes the great advanced agronomist Michurin and Lysenko as its working mentors. This fresh banner has attracted a large number of rural labor heroes, farmers, agronomists, agricultural workers, and teachers and students of agricultural schools to participate. In the past month alone, more than ten organizations, including the Tianjin Reclamation Farm, the Tianjin Construction Bureau Gardening Section, the Tong County Farm, and the Liaocheng Prefectural Commissioner's Office of Agriculture, as well as more than 200 labor heroes from various regions, have applied to join the society. Together with the previous members, there are now more than 3,000 members. More than ten branches have been established in various regions.          (Li Jigeng)

　　米邱林学会首届年会定明后两日在京举行
    【本报讯】米邱林学会顷决定于十八、十九两日假北京西郊农业大学召开第一届年会。参加者除该会各地分会代表及在京各有关机关团体代表与农业专家等外，尚有石家庄的农民代表，各地劳动英雄、模范农业工作者十余人。会上将交流各地经验，推广先进的农业科学知识，并讨论加强该会的组织，以期开展全国性的米邱林运动。按米邱林学会成立于一九四九年春季，会址起初设在石家庄华北大学农学院内。其后华大农学院与北京大学农学院、清华大学农学院合并组成农业大学。米邱林学会即随之迁往北京西郊农业大学内。该会是一个农业科学工作者与农村实际工作者结合组成的学会。它以唯物论辩证法为基础，以伟大的先进农学家米邱林和李森科为工作的导师。这一面新鲜的旗帜，吸引了广大的农村劳动英雄、农民、农学家、农业工作者和农业学校的师生参加。最近一月中申请参加该会的有天津农垦场、天津建设局园林科、通县农场、聊城专署农业科等十余团体以及各地劳动英雄二百余人。连前已共有会员三千人以上。各地已成立分会十余处。          （李继耕）
