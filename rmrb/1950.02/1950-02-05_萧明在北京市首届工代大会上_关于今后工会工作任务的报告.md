Xiao Ming's Report on Future Trade Union Work Tasks at the First Beijing Municipal Congress of Trade Unions

Xiao Ming, Director of the Preparatory Committee of the Beijing Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, delivered a report on the future tasks of trade unions in Beijing at the First Beijing Municipal Congress of Trade Unions. The full text is as follows:

The central tasks of Beijing's trade union work at present are: to continue to restore and develop production, consolidate and expand trade union organizations, and carry out systematic worker education.

First, continue to restore and develop production. Collective contracts should be signed in state-owned enterprises. These contracts should clearly stipulate labor conditions, production standards, wages, working hours, and workers' labor protection and welfare, so that both the factory and the workers have something to follow. When starting to draw up the contract, the content of the clauses should not include too much. For example, if there is one clause, draw up one clause; if there are two clauses, draw up two clauses. This is easier to do. The trade union should earnestly lead the workers, continue to work hard to restore and develop production according to the collective contract, earnestly discuss the production plans proposed by the factory, launch production emulation campaigns to increase output, improve quality, and reduce costs, ensure the completion of the production plan, and strive to exceed it. The trade union should also mobilize employees to study and improve technology and labor organization, and put forward rationalization proposals to the factory. In private enterprises, continue to sign collective labor-capital contracts. The trade union must guarantee the completion of the production plan in accordance with the contract.

Second, consolidate and expand trade union organizations and improve trade union organizational life. In the future, efforts will be made to basically organize handicraftsmen and shop assistants within one year. In the established trade unions, especially industrial trade unions, strengthen the leading backbone and establish regular trade union work. In industries where trade unions have not been established, rely on the existing trade union organizations in larger workshops and shops, rely on Party organizations and activists, use the organizational form of representative meetings, and gradually establish and improve trade union organizations in these industries.

Third, continue to strengthen workers' class education, especially internationalism education and policy education, and carry out workers' spare-time cultural and literacy education. Those who have not undergone political education and enlightenment education should still focus on political education. Those who have received preliminary political education can be mobilized to participate in workers' spare-time schools that focus on cultural learning. For workers' technical education, the trade union should be responsible for mobilizing and organizing, and the administrative side should be responsible for sending appropriate technical personnel and skilled workers to act as teachers and provide material assistance.

In addition, there is general trade union work:

First, the work of the factory management committee: In this regard, we have gained preliminary experience and achievements. In the future, we must continue to carry out this work based on existing experience to thoroughly overcome the bureaucratic tendency of factory management being divorced from the masses. Workers should, through their representatives, reflect their opinions to the factory management committee or the administration at any time; administrative cadres responsible for production management should also regularly inspect various departments and workshops in the factory to solve the production-related problems raised by workers in a timely manner. Only in this way can the connection between the administration and all employees be close, can the enthusiasm of the employees be fully utilized, and can the rapid restoration and development of production be guaranteed under the leadership of the administration.

Second, in order to complete one of the central tasks of education, it is necessary to compile systematic political teaching materials, cultural teaching materials, and popular reading materials in accordance with the workers' level of awareness and ideological situation. Provide regular leadership to worker training classes and specifically help solve various difficulties in their teaching materials and work. Active members of trade unions at all levels should be given systematic education through staff schools and large classes to improve them ideologically and in terms of work ability, in order to increase the leading backbone of trade unions in various factories and industries. At the same time, the Federation of Trade Unions should focus on training a group of publicity and education backbone personnel to carry out popular education through this group of backbone personnel. In addition, it is necessary to conduct current affairs education regularly. For major international and domestic events, special reports should be organized, and discussions and question-and-answer sessions should be organized after the reports. In addition, widely use newspapers, radio, blackboards, theater groups, singing teams, and other forms to carry out publicity and mobilization work. Organize the performance of various small dramas, songs, and dances suitable for workers' tastes, and strengthen the work of workers' clubs to liven up workers' cultural and recreational life and improve workers' production morale.

Third, labor protection and welfare work: It is wrong to neglect the restoration and development of production and simply emphasize the treatment of workers' labor protection and welfare, but the tendency to neglect workers' labor protection and welfare is also wrong.

We must give due attention and improvement to workers' labor protection and welfare. On the basis of the current restoration and development of production, the following points should be made as far as possible regarding employee labor protection and welfare issues:

1. Labor protection inspectors should be set up first, serious attention should be paid to necessary and possible safety and health equipment and regular inspection systems, especially in mines and the chemical industry.

2. It is recommended that the government and major factories and enterprises increase free or reduced-fee medical equipment.

3. Suggest or assist the government in formulating interim measures for labor protection.

4. Develop and improve worker consumer cooperatives.

5. Ensure the implementation of the resolution on relieving unemployed employees.

As for the adjustment of unreasonable wages, it should be resolved in the collective contract.

Fourth, youth worker and female worker work: Youth worker and female worker work is one of the important tasks of the trade union. In this city, young workers account for about one-third of the total number of workers in the city. Among young workers, the main task is to organize the learning of technology in order to master and improve technology, so that young workers can play a greater role in production and construction. Among female workers, special emphasis should be placed on strengthening female workers' political education, improving their class consciousness, and participating in various production undertakings.

　　萧明在北京市首届工代大会上
    关于今后工会工作任务的报告
    【北京讯】京市总工会筹委会主任萧明在北京市首届工代大会上关于北京市今后工会工作任务的报告，全文如下：
    当前北京市工会工作的中心任务是：继续恢复与发展生产、巩固和扩大工会组织和进行系统的工人教育。
    第一、继续恢复与发展生产。在公营企业中要订立集体合同。在此合同中应明确规定劳动条件、生产标准、工资、工时及工人劳保福利等，以便厂方与工人双方都有所遵循。当开始订立时，其中条文内容不要包括太多，如有一条即订立一条，有二条即订立二条，这样比较容易订立。工会应切实领导工人，根据集体合同继续努力恢复与发展生产，认真讨论工厂所提出的生产计划，开展增加产量、提高质量、减低成本的生产竞赛运动，保证生产计划的完成，并争取超过之。工会并应发动员工研究改善技术与劳动组织，向厂方提出合理化建议。在私营企业中继续订立劳资集体合同，工会必须按照合同保证生产计划的完成。
    第二、巩固与扩大工会组织、健全工会组织生活。今后争取在一年内继续把手工业工人、店员工人基本上组织起来。在已建立的各工会中，特别是产业工会，健全领导骨干，建立工会的经常工作。在未建立工会的各行业中，应依靠较大的作坊、商店已有的工会组织，依靠党的组织和积极分子，运用代表会议的组织形式，逐步建立和健全各该行业的工会组织。
    第三、继续加强工人的阶级教育，特别是国际主义教育和政策教育，进行工人业余文化补习教育。凡是没有进行过政治教育和启蒙教育者，仍以政治教育为主。已经受过初步政治教育者，可动员其参加以文化为主的工人业余学校学习。工人的技术教育，工会应负责动员组织，行政方面应负责派适当的技术人员和熟练工人充当教员并给予物质帮助。
    此外还有工会一般工作：
    第一、工厂管理委员会的工作：在这方面，我们已取得了初步的经验和成绩，今后要继续根据已有的经验来开展这一工作，以彻底克服工厂管理上脱离群众的官僚主义倾向。工人应通过自己的代表，随时向工厂管理委员会或行政方面反映意见；行政上负责管理生产的干部，又应经常在厂内各部门、各车间巡回视察，及时解决工人所提出的有关生产的问题。只有这样才能密切行政上与全体员工的联系，才能充分发挥员工的积极性，并保证全体员工在行政领导下，迅速恢复与发展生产。
    第二、为了完成中心工作之一的教育工作，必须依照工人觉悟程度和思想情况，编制有系统的政治教材、文化教材和通俗读物。给工人训练班以经常的领导，并具体帮助解决其教材和工作上的各种困难。对各级工会积极分子，应利用职工学校和上大课等方式，给以系统的教育。从思想上和工作能力上提高他们，以增加各工厂、行业工会的领导骨干。同时，总工会应有重点的训练一批宣教工作骨干，通过这一批骨干去进行普及教育。又必须经常进行时事教育，凡国际国内重大事件，应组织专门报告，并在报告后组织讨论和解答问题。此外，广泛利用报纸、广播、黑板报、剧团、歌咏队等形式，进行宣传鼓动工作。组织适合工人口味的各种小型剧、歌咏和舞蹈的演出，并加强工人俱乐部工作，活跃工人文化娱乐生活，提高工人生产情绪。
    第三、劳保福利工作：忽视生产的恢复与发展，单纯强调工人劳保福利的待遇是错误的，但忽视工人劳保福利的倾向同样也是错误的。
    我们对于工人的劳保福利，必须予以应有的重视和改进。在目前恢复与发展生产的基础上，关于职工劳保福利问题，应尽可能作到下列各点：
    １、应首先设立劳保检查员，严重注意必要的和可能的安全卫生设备和经常的检查制度，特别在矿山、化学工业中。
    ２、建议政府和各大工厂企业增设免费或减费的医疗设备。
    ３、建议或协助政府制定劳保暂行办法。
    ４、发展和改进工人消费合作社。
    ５、保证执行救济失业员工决议案。
    至于不合理工资的调整，应在集体合同中解决。
    第四、青工和女工工作：青工和女工工作，是工会重要工作之一。本市青工，在数量上约占全市工人总数的三分之一。青工中主要是组织学习技术，以便掌握和提高技术，使青工在生产建设上发挥更大的作用。在女工中应特别加强女工政治教育，提高她们的阶级觉悟，参加各种生产事业。
