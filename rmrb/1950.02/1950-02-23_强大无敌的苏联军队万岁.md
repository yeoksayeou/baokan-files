　　Long Live the Powerful and Invincible Soviet Army
　　Nie Rongzhen
    The Soviet Army is an army armed by Lenin and Stalin with the great spirit of internationalism and patriotism, with Stalin's outstanding military theory, and with modern and powerful armed equipment. This is a completely new army from its political quality to its military technology. This is an army with the richest war experience in the fierce battles against internal and external enemies. This is an heroic and invincible people's armed force.

    The Soviet Army is not only the heroic defender of the Soviet Socialist Republics, but also the staunch defender of world peace and people's democracy, and the liberation army of all mankind. It is very clear that without the October Socialist Revolution, without the Soviet Army armed on the basis of the victory of socialist construction, without the great victory of the Soviet Union in defeating German and Japanese fascism, there would be no victory of the people's democratic revolution in Eastern Europe, Korea, China, and other countries, and there would be no vigorous revolutionary movement in the world today. At the same time, precisely because there is such an army in the world that defends the socialist motherland and defends world peace, and because of the victory of the people's democratic revolution in Eastern Europe, Korea, and China, the instigators of war tremble and dare not easily launch new wars of aggression, making lasting world peace possible. Today, after the signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance, we can see more clearly the role played by the powerful Soviet armed forces as defenders of world peace.

    Therefore, we can conclude that the power and invincibility of the Soviet Army is the guarantee of human happiness.

    Therefore, we wholeheartedly cheer long live the powerful and invincible Soviet Army!

    Therefore, in order to faithfully abide by the obligations of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance – “In the event of one of the Contracting Parties being subjected to aggression by Japan or any State allied with Japan and thus being involved in a state of war, the other Contracting Party shall immediately render military and other assistance by all means in its power” – we must pay close attention to the construction of the Chinese People's Liberation Army so that the Chinese People's Liberation Army can be as powerful and invincible as the Soviet Army.

    To enable the Chinese People's Liberation Army to learn from the Soviet Army, we must strengthen the construction of our people's motherland, strengthen the study of Stalin's theory and Mao Zedong Thought, strengthen the study of culture and science and technology, and strengthen the study of the great internationalism and patriotism and strict discipline of the Soviet Army. Under the leadership of Chairman Mao, we are capable of learning, and capable of learning well.

    The progressive people of the whole world are concerned about the power and invincibility of the Soviet Army. We are deeply fortunate and proud to have such a completely new people's armed force as our example in the Soviet Army. At the same time, our People's Liberation Army firmly believes that we will never tarnish our great fraternal alliance. Let us cheer:

    Long live the powerful and invincible Soviet Army!

　　强大无敌的苏联军队万岁
　　聂荣臻
    苏联军队，是由列宁和斯大林用伟大的国际主义和爱国主义精神、用斯大林杰出的军事学说武装起来的，用现代的强大的武装装备起来的军队。这是一支从其政治质量直至军事技术方面完全新的军队。这是一支在反对内外敌人的残酷战斗中最富有战争经验的军队。这是一支英勇无敌的人民武装。
    苏联军队，不仅是苏维埃社会主义共和国的英勇保卫者，并且是全世界和平与人民民主的坚强保卫者，是全人类的解放军。这是很显然的，没有十月社会主义革命，没有在社会主义建设胜利的基础之上武装起来的苏联军队，没有苏联击败德日法西斯的伟大胜利，就谈不到东欧和朝鲜、中国等国家的人民民主革命的胜利，就谈不到今天世界蓬蓬勃勃的革命运动。同时，正因为世界上有了这样一支保卫社会主义祖国、保卫世界和平的军队，有了东欧及朝鲜、中国人民民主革命的胜利，才使得战争的挑拨者发抖，不敢轻易地发动新的侵略战争，使持久的世界和平成为可能。在中苏友好同盟互助条约签订后的今天，我们对于作为世界和平保卫者的强大的苏联武装所起的作用，可以看得更清楚了。
    因此，我们可以得出结论：苏联军队的强大无敌，就是人类幸福的保证。
    因此，我们衷心地为强大无敌的苏联军队而欢呼万岁！
    因此，我们为了很好地信守中苏友好同盟互助条约的义务——“一旦缔约国任何一方受到日本或与日本同盟的国家之侵袭，因而处于战争状态时，缔约国另一方即尽其全力予以军事及其他援助”，就要十分关心中国人民解放军的建设，使中国人民解放军能够像苏联军队同样强大无敌。
    要使中国人民解放军能够向苏联军队看齐，就必须加强我人民祖国的建设，加强对斯大林学说与毛泽东思想的学习，加强对文化和科学技术的学习，加强对苏联军队伟大国际主义和爱国主义精神、严格的纪律性的学习。我们在毛主席领导之下，是能够学习，能够学习得好的。
    全世界进步人类在关心着苏联军队的强大无敌。我们深以有苏联军队这样完全新的人民武装作为我们的榜样，而感到无限庆幸和骄傲。同时，我们人民解放军深信，我们决不玷辱我们伟大的兄弟同盟。让我们欢呼：
    强大无敌的苏联军队万岁！
