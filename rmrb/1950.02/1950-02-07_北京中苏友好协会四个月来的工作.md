The Beijing Sino-Soviet Friendship Association has achieved great success in the past four months by combining the promotion of Sino-Soviet friendship with the extensive recruitment of members and the establishment of organizations at all levels. Currently, the association has decided to strengthen its publicity and education work, as well as its work in factories and suburban areas, in order to further develop the work of the Friendship Association. To date, the Beijing Sino-Soviet Friendship Association has established a total of 232 units, including general branches and branches, consisting of 29 general branches and 203 branches. The number of registered members has reached over 156,000 (signatures participating but not yet registered are not included). Among them, workers are the most numerous, totaling 36,654; followed by students, totaling 35,125. Suburban members total 28,000. There are more members in the Eighth and Thirteenth Districts because the responsible comrades of the District Committees of the Communist Party of China and the cadres of various units attach importance to the work of the Friendship Association, which has enabled the work of the Friendship Association to develop smoothly. In particular, in the Thirteenth District, the District Committee of the Communist Party of China combined the work of the Friendship Association with the central tasks of production and land reform, and added the promotion of Sino-Soviet friendship and the introduction of the Soviet Union to the central tasks, making the content of the Friendship Association's work more substantial, and the masses have been actively requesting to join the Friendship Association.

In the past four months, the Association has done a lot of work in organizing city-wide commemorative meetings, celebrations, propaganda, education, and services. It has successively organized or cooperated with the All-China Sino-Soviet Friendship Association in holding various gatherings to welcome and send off Soviet friends, as well as lectures and commemorative meetings for the October Revolution Day. During the celebration of Marshal Stalin's 70th birthday, it held lectures and celebration meetings, organized 200,000 people from various branches to sign birthday greetings, and organized representatives from 211 units, totaling 20,000 people, to send gifts to the Soviet Embassy to celebrate the birthday. On the occasion of the 26th anniversary of Lenin's death, the Association organized more than 500 representatives from more than 230 units to participate in lecture commemorative meetings, and publicized Lenin's life and the significance of commemorating Lenin in various branches.

Promoting Sino-Soviet Friendship and Organizing Members to Study

In terms of propaganda, education, and service work, the Association has continuously conducted lectures on Sino-Soviet friendship and Friendship Association issues in various branches since the beginning of its work, held a propaganda week on the radio, and cooperated with the All-China Friendship Association in organizing 12 lecture film evenings, and printed and distributed 5,000 copies of reference materials on the October Revolution and 500 copies of Lenin's biography to various branches. Since October, the Association has been regularly showing films to various branches with the help of the service department of the All-China Friendship Association. During the celebration of Marshal Stalin's birthday, films were shown in the army and factories for ten days each. Since January of this year, the Association has purchased two film projectors and has been showing films in suburban factories and rural areas. In January, a total of 79 screenings were held, showing 18 films, with a total audience of 77,500 people. Before each screening, a brief promotion of Sino-Soviet friendship was conducted, which was welcomed by the masses. The Association's service department has been running a Russian radio lecture series, compiling its own teaching materials, and broadcasting six times a week (now increased to nine times at the request of listeners). Ninety-six units have registered with the Association to organize group learning. The first issue of teaching materials sold 9,000 copies, and the second issue sold 6,500 copies. The Russian lecture series has recently adopted a weekly review method, answering questions on the radio and in study groups, and has also invited students from the Russian Department of Normal University to help listeners learn in various study groups. A social gathering is held once a month, with people from each study group taking turns to participate, and the lecturers explain the problems, which has a greater effect. In terms of picture exhibitions, a total of 26 days of exhibitions on Soviet construction, the life of the Soviet people, and Soviet collective farms were held in the western suburbs, the Revolutionary University, Tsinghua University, Yanjing University, and the administrative villages of the 13th district in the suburbs. About 15,000 people visited the exhibitions.

In the past few months, the Association has combined the promotion of Sino-Soviet friendship with the development of members and the establishment of Friendship Association organizations at all levels in the first two months of its work, which has achieved great success. However, in addition to organizational work, other work has remained at the city-wide concentrated activities, focusing on commemorative meetings, welcoming, and sending-off meetings, etc., and insufficient attention has been paid to the propaganda and education of the majority of members. In terms of working methods, it waited for the replenishment of material conditions (such as film projectors, etc.) before proceeding, resulting in a more serious tendency to detach from members, making many branch organizations become a formality. In January of this year, the Association summarized its work in the past year, reviewed this tendency, and put forward the policy of facing the masses and strengthening propaganda and education work, putting the main task on studying the work of branches, leading and helping branches to carry out their work, so that branches can gradually lead members to carry out Sino-Soviet friendship and learn from Soviet activities. The Association has convened suburban and factory branches to conduct detailed reviews of past work, discussed and arranged future work. It has clearly stipulated that propaganda and education work is the central work of the Friendship Association, and that Sino-Soviet friendship and internationalism education should be conducted regularly among members and the general public. It also stipulates that the work of the Friendship Association should be combined with the current central work of each unit, and requires each unit to take care of the work of the Friendship Association as a part of its work. At the same time, each department has enriched its work by adding the work of the Friendship Association and adding the content of learning from the Soviet Union. This work policy has proven to be correct based on the recent successful experience of combining land reform with the development of the Friendship Association's work in the 13th district.

Existing Problems and Future Work Plans

The current problems of the Association are: First, the work in factories has not been well developed. Only more than 36,000 of the 180,000 trade union members in the city have joined the Association. This is due to the lack of close contact between the Association and the trade union and the insufficient attention paid to the work of the Friendship Association by some trade union workers. Second, most of the general branches (large ones with about 20,000 people) and larger branches (about 2,000 people) do not have full-time cadres responsible for carrying out the work of the Friendship Association, and lack funds, which prevents the organized and planned promotion of various tasks of the Friendship Association, which has a greater impact on the development of the work of the Friendship Association. The Association has decided to strengthen the work of the Factory Friendship Association in the future, strive to establish full-time cadres in each general branch and larger branch, and find ways to solve the funding difficulties, in order to carry out future work.

　　北京中苏友好协会四个月来的工作
    建立了各级组织，会员达十五万余
    北京中苏友好协会四个多月来，结合着宣传中苏友好，大量发展会员，建立各级组织，有了很大的成绩，现该会决定加强宣教工作和工厂、郊区会务，以进一步开展友协工作。到目前为止，北京中苏友协已成立了总支会及支会共二百三十二个单位，计总支会二十九个，支会二百零三个。会员人数，已登记的有十五万六千余人（签名参加尚未登记的未统计在内）。其中以工人最多，共三万六千六百五十四名；其次为学生，共三万五千一百二十五名。郊区会员共二万八千名。其中八区和十三区会员较多，因该两区中共区委负责人和各单位干部重视友协工作，使得友协工作顺利地发展起来。尤以第十三区因中共区委把友协工作和生产、土地改革等中心工作结合进行，在中心工作中加上宣传中苏友好，介绍苏联，使得友协工作内容充实起来，群众纷纷要求加入友协。
    该会四个多月来，在组织全市性的纪念会、庆祝会及宣教、服务等方面曾做了许多工作。先后组织或配合中苏友协总会举办了各种欢迎、欢送苏联朋友的集会，及十月革命节演讲会、纪念大会。在庆祝斯大林大元帅七十寿辰时举办了讲演会、庆祝大会，并组织了各支会二十万人的签名祝寿，和二百十一个单位代表两万人到苏联大使馆送礼祝寿。纪念列宁逝世二十六周年时，该会组织了二百三十余单位五百多位代表参加了讲演纪念会，在各支会中宣传列宁的生平和纪念列宁的意义。
  宣传中苏友好，组织会员学习
    在宣教和服务工作方面，该会从开始工作以来，就不断地到各支会进行中苏友好和友协问题的讲演，在广播电台举行过宣传周，并和友协总会配合组织了讲演电影晚会十二次，印发各支会十月革命参考资料五千份和列宁生平五百份。从十月份起，该会在友协总会服务部帮助下，向各支会经常放映电影。庆祝斯大林大元帅寿辰时曾在部队和工厂中各放映电影十天。从本年一月起，该会自置电影机两部，到郊区工厂和农村放映。一月来共放映了七十九场，十八部影片，观众共七万七千五百多人。每次放映前，并进行简短的中苏友好宣传，受到了广大群众的欢迎。该会服务部举办了俄文广播讲座，自编讲义，每周播讲六次（现经听众要求已增至九次）。向该会登记组织集体学习的有九十六个单位。讲义第一期售出九千份，第二期售出六千五百份。俄文讲座最近采用了每周复习的方法，在电台和学习组解答问题，还邀请师大俄文系同学到各学习组中去帮助听众学习。并定每月举行一次联欢会，由各学习组轮流派人参加，由主讲人讲解问题，收效较大。图片展览方面，先后在西郊、革大、清华、燕大及郊区第十三区各行政村举行过二十六天，展览苏联建设、苏联人民生活和苏联集体农庄等图片，参观者约一万五千人。
    该会这几个月来，结合着宣传中苏友好，在前两个月的工作中，把发展会员，建立各级友协组织作为中心，曾收到了很大的成绩，但是，除了组织工作之外，别的工作停留在全市性的集中活动上，偏重于搞纪念会、欢迎、欢送会等活动，对广大会员的宣传教育工作则注意得不够。在工作方式上则等待充实物资条件（如电影机等）然后进行，结果发生了比较严重的脱离会员的偏向，使许多支会组织流于形式。今年一月份，该会总结了去年的工作，检讨出了这种偏向，提出面向群众，加强宣传教育工作的方针，把主要的工作任务放在研究支会工作，领导和帮助支会开展工作上，使支会逐渐做到能领导会员进行中苏友好、学习苏联的活动。该会已召集了郊区和工厂支会详细检讨了过去的工作，讨论与布置了今后的工作。明确规定宣教工作是友协的中心工作，应经常向会员和广大群众进行中苏友好、国际主义教育。并规定友协工作要结合各单位当前中心工作进行，并要求各单位把友协工作当作工作的一部分加以照顾。同时，各部门因加上了友协工作，加上了学习苏联的内容而更充实了自己的工作。这一工作方针，根据最近在十三区结合土地改革开展该区友协工作的成功经验，证明是正确的。
    现存问题及今后工作计划
    该会现在存在的问题是：一、工厂工作尚未很好开展，全市十八万工会会员只有三万六千余人参加该会。这是由于该会和工会联系不密切和有些工会工作人员对友协工作重视不够之故。二、各总支会（大的约二万多人）及较大的支会（约二千人左右）多没有专职干部负责进行友协工作，并缺乏经费，致友协各种工作不能有组织、有计划地推动，使友协工作的开展受到了较大的影响。该会决定今后加强工厂友协工作，争取在各总支会和较大的支会设立专职干部，并设法解决经费困难，以便开展今后的工作。
