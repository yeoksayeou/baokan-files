    Lehmann Calls on Progressive People to Join National Front
    [Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, February 9th] West German dockworkers have also joined the struggle against the US-British imperialist preparations for a new war. According to a February 6th report by the Berlin newspaper Vorwärts (Forward), representatives of dockworkers from Hamburg and Bremen, the largest ports in West Germany, passed a resolution declaring that dockworkers will act in unison with dockworkers in France, Belgium, the Netherlands, and Italy to guarantee that they will not unload US-British military supplies. Max Reimann, Chairman of the Communist Party of Germany, delivered a speech to representatives of Hamburg dockworkers and the city and port of Bremen, calling on railway workers and transportation workers to also refuse to unload US-British military supplies, and called on all progressive German people to join the National Front and fight for peace. Reimann stated: "The task of the working people of West Germany is to cooperate with all democratic forces in the world and to establish a strong front to fight for peace and against war provocateurs."
