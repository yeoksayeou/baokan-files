　　Hebei Education Department Issues Instructions
    Carry Out Year-Round Literacy Education
    One Million Winter School Students Continue Learning After Spring Festival; Winter Schools May Conditionally Be Transformed into Year-Round Private Schools
    [Reported by this newspaper] On the 12th, the Education Department of the Hebei Provincial People's Government issued instructions to all subordinate administrative offices and municipal, county, and town people's governments. It demanded that winter school work continue to be implemented until the spring plowing begins. At that time, the winter school movement should be concluded in a planned and guided manner, and experiences should be summarized promptly. In areas with suitable conditions, year-round literacy education should be carried out.
    The instructions stated: "Except for severely disaster-stricken areas, most villages in our province have established winter schools. According to statistics from 62 counties and towns, including Xinle, 11,816 villages have established winter schools, accounting for 66 percent of the total number of administrative villages. According to statistics from 86 counties and towns, including Dingxian, the number of enrolled young and middle-aged students has reached 990,860. Combining teaching with winter production and other work has improved the political awareness and production enthusiasm of the broad masses. In terms of cultural learning, from the beginning of the school year to mid-January, students in many areas have learned 150 to 160 new characters and some applied knowledge. In short, the winter school movement has achieved certain results."
    The instructions required winter school students to continue learning after the Spring Festival. After the Spring Festival holiday, winter schools in various places should seize the time to start school on the fifth day of the first lunar month and restore the learning state before the Spring Festival. Overcome the idea that learning will not continue after the Spring Festival. At the same time, the main problems and deviations existing in the winter school movement should be reviewed and corrected, such as: the laissez-faire attitude of leadership in some areas, the forced orders when mobilizing students, and the neglect of political and ideological education in most winter schools, as well as the failure to solve funding problems in a timely manner.
    The instructions went on to say: All localities should "conclude the winter school movement in a guided manner according to the time when local farmers start spring plowing. Conduct tests, evaluate and reward model winter schools and model winter school teachers. Summarize from the bottom up, and complete the report to the department before the end of March. It is necessary to prevent the phenomenon of not paying attention to the end of the winter sports work and having no end."
    The instructions proposed: "In areas where land reform has long been completed, production has recovered well, and culture is relatively developed, based on the voluntary participation of the masses, well-managed winter schools can be transformed into year-round private schools under leadership. Each county must propose specific requirements for the number of villages to be converted into year-round private schools based on actual conditions. In carrying out year-round literacy education, attention should be paid to solving the contradiction between teachers' production and teaching. Use methods such as exchanging labor, mutual assistance, and in-kind rewards to solve their practical difficulties. Hold school-private teacher meetings at the county or district level to exchange teaching experience and improve teaching quality. Textbooks should still use the literacy textbooks for private schools issued by Xinhua Bookstore; and according to actual needs, textbooks or materials published in newspapers and magazines (such as textbooks on common knowledge for workers, peasants, and women, etc.) can be used. All localities should take the initiative to maintain close contact with Xinhua Bookstore to ensure that the masses can buy textbooks. The expenses of year-round private schools should still be determined by each administrative office and county according to its own expenditure standards."

　　河北教育厅发出指示
    开展常年识字教育
    百万冬学学员春节后继续学习有条件地把冬学转为常年民校
    【本报讯】河北省人民政府教育厅于十二日向所属各专署和市、县、镇人民政府发出指示。要求继续把冬学工作贯彻下去，直到春耕开始时为止，届时应有计划有领导地结束冬学运动，及时总结经验；在有条件的地区，应开展常年识字教育。
    指示称：“我省除严重灾区外，大部村庄均成立了冬学。据新乐等六十二个县镇的统计，有一一八一六个村成立了冬学，占行政村总数的百分之六十六。又据定县等八十六个县镇统计，入学青壮年学员已达九九○八六○人。在教学中与冬季生产等工作相结合，提高了广大群众的政治觉悟和生产热情；在文化学习方面，自开学到一月中旬，不少地区的学员已学会了一百五、六十个生字及一些应用知识。总之，冬学运动是获得了一定的成绩的。”
    指示要求冬学学员在春节后继续学习。各地冬学在春节放假后，应于旧历正月初五日抓紧开学，恢复春节前的学习状态。克服过了春节就不再学习了的思想。同时对冬学运动中存在的主要问题及偏向要检讨纠正。如：某些地区领导上的放任自流，动员学员时的强迫命令以及大部分冬学忽视政治思想教育，解决经费问题不及时等。
    指示接着说：各地应“根据当地农民春耕开动时间，有领导地结束冬学运动。举行测验，评判及奖励模范冬学和模范冬学教师。自下而上地进行总结，三月底以前完成报厅。要防止不注意结束冬运工作有始无终的现象。”
    指示提出：“在土改早已结束，生产恢复较好，文化较发达的地区，基于群众的自愿，可以有领导地将办理较好的冬学转为常年民校。各县须根据实际情况提出转为常年民校村数的具体要求。在开展常年识字教育中，应注意解决师资及教师生产与教学相矛盾的问题。用换工、互助、实物奖励等办法解决其实际困难。以县或区为单位召开校民教师会议，交换教学经验，提高教学质量。教材仍采用新华书店所发行的民校识字课本；并可根据实际需要，采用报纸杂志上所刊登之课本或材料（如工农妇女常识课本等）。各地应与新华书店主动密切联系，保证群众能买到课本。常年民校经费，仍由各专署、县自行规定开支标准。”
