　　The Crimes of "Loubao," "Luoche," and "Houche"
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　Ke Fu

　　In 1928, "Loubao" organizations appeared at the Beijing East Railway Station. Those who participated in "Loubao" were all thugs and ruffians who engaged in extortion under the guise of helping travelers send and receive goods and pay taxes. After 1937, their leaders, "Green Gang" boss Han Qingkai and others, colluded with Liu Shaolin, a secret agent of the Japanese invaders' police section, and the Kuomintang puppet police departments and luggage rooms. Under the protection of reactionary rule, they colluded with each other and bullied travelers even more.

　　After the liberation of Beijing, the People's Government reformed various unreasonable phenomena at the station. Since June of last year, after the station implemented improved operations and simplified procedures, it not only facilitated the vast number of travelers but also eliminated the extortion activities of the "Loubao" at the station. However, the "Loubao" leaders, led by Han Qingkai and Feng Deshan, were not reconciled to these reforms that benefited the people. So, in early July, they gathered a group of "Loubao" and organized meetings in the Duck Mouth, Chessboard Street, and Tiananmen areas, plotting to smash the station's luggage room or coerce the trade union of the Outer Second District to recognize their extortion at the station as legitimate. After the Public Security Bureau investigated and verified this, they immediately conducted persuasion and education and disbanded them.

　　After this education, the "Loubao" still did not know how to correct their mistakes. The "Loubao," led by Ji Wenqi and Gao Wenyuan, successively transferred to the private automobile sector, demanding "arm money," one-tenth of their daily income, from the freelance automobile drivers. In mid-October, Ji Wenqi and Gao Wenyuan led "Loubao" Zhao Wenliang, Liu Dekui, Qin Enfu, Li Yongji, Wang Peiguang, Wu Xuming, Mei Yufang, and seven others to extort money from the long-distance bus ticket offices. When Luo Xingtai, who was selling long-distance bus tickets on commission, refused to meet their demands, Mei Yufang, Wu Xuming, Li Yongji, and others smashed the shop and injured Ma Suofa, an apprentice in the shop. The Tongxing and Hexing ticket offices were extorted more than 5 million yuan in two months. As for bullying travelers and interfering with traffic and other destructive activities, there were countless instances. In November, they attempted to further extort private cars, forcibly increasing the "arm money" from one-tenth to two-tenths. After being reported, the Public Security Bureau arrested Ji Wenqi, Wu Xulu, Qin Enfu, and three other criminals.

　　Another group of "Loubao," led by Han Baolin, organized themselves and infiltrated the ranks of rickshaw pullers at the station. However, they did not have their own cars. When they found passengers, they forcibly took other people's cars. Sometimes, they would turn on the passengers and extort money if they didn't reach their destination. On November 24th of last year, an old woman from Jinan was taken by "Loubao" Cheng Wenming for a ride around Zhushikou and back to the station, extorting 700 yuan from her. In addition, they bullied honest rickshaw pullers. For example, "Loubao" Wu Xuming forcibly took 10,000 yuan earned by rickshaw puller Wu Wenyuan. Such incidents happened frequently. The "Loubao" Wang Shuxiang, Jin Pangzi, Diao Sunlu, and others who mixed in with the flatbed cart workers not only colluded with the secret agent Duan Mazi to oppress and exploit other workers but also monopolized the area around the station, forbidding others from soliciting business.

　　In addition to countless crimes such as running gambling dens, gathering crowds to commit violence, engaging in forced buying and selling, and refusing to repay debts, the "Loubao" Wang Shuxiang, Zhao Baolin, Jin Pangzi, Diao Sunlu, and thirteen others also privately organized "trade unions" and "transportation brigades," plotting to infiltrate the stevedores' representative meeting and trying to bribe individual worker representatives to undermine the trade union organization.

　　The "Luoche" were more than thirty local ruffians mixed in with the rickshaw pullers. They often solicited passengers at the station and took the opportunity to steal travelers' belongings. Sometimes, several "Luoche" would surround a traveler with a lot of luggage, pulling and tugging, engaging in collective theft.

　　The "Houche" were those who, before liberation, specialized in taking foreigners from Dongjiaomin Lane to brothels and to find prostitutes, earning "brokerage fees." After liberation, they all moved to the bustling areas of Dongdan and Rice Market Street, ganging up, not only occupying territory and bullying other rickshaw pullers but also forcing women into prostitution and profiting from it, and forcibly pulling customers on the streets and extorting money.

　　The vast number of citizens of Beijing have unanimously expressed their anger at the criminal acts of these reactionary gangster organizations in disrupting revolutionary order and oppressing and exploiting the working people, and have demanded that the Municipal Public Security Bureau deal with them according to the law. The bureau accepted this just demand and disbanded them all yesterday (the 12th).

### “搂包”、“锣车”、“猴车”的罪行

　　“搂包”、“锣车”、“猴车”的罪行
    柯夫
    一九二八年，北京东车站即出现了“搂包”组织。参加“搂包”的都是些恶棍和打手，他们以替来往旅客寄取货物及上税为名，进行敲诈勒索。自一九三七年后，他们的头目“青帮”头子韩清凯等先后串通了日寇的警务段特务刘少林，和国民党伪警各厅及行李房，彼此在反动统治的庇护下狼狈为奸，欺压旅客更甚。
    北京解放后，人民政府对车站上种种不合理现象进行改革。自去年六月起，车站实行改进业务和简化手续后，不但方便了广大旅客，且肃清了“搂包”们在车站内的敲诈勒索活动。但是，以韩清凯、冯德山等为首的“搂包”头子，对这些有利于人民的改革并不甘心，于是在七月初旬，他们就纠集了一群“搂包”，先后在鸭子嘴、棋盘街、天安门一带组织开会，阴谋砸毁车站行李房，或要胁外二区职工会承认他们在车站上敲诈勒索是合法的；经公安局查明后，立即进行说服教育，并予解散。
    “搂包”们经过这次教育后，仍不知改过自新。以吉文启、高文元为首的“搂包”们，即先后转移到私营汽车方面，向零散揽坐的汽车司机，强要每日收入十分之一的“胳膊钱”。十月中旬以吉文启、高文元为首分别带领“搂包”赵文亮、刘德魁、秦恩富、李永吉、王佩光、吴绪明、梅玉芳等十四名，对长途汽车售票处进行敲诈勒索，其中代卖长途汽车票的罗兴泰因不答应他们的要求，梅玉芳、吴绪明、李永吉等竟将该店砸毁，并打伤该店徒弟马所发。同兴、合兴等两家售票处，在两个月中即被勒索五十余万元。至于欺压旅客，干涉行车等破坏活动更是不胜枚举，十一月中，他们企图对私营汽车更进一步敲诈，强要把“胳膊钱”由十分之一提到十分之二，被告发后，公安局始将吉文启、吴绪禄、秦恩富等三犯扣押。
    另一部分以韩宝林为首的“搂包”，就组织起来钻到车站的三轮车工人中去。但是他们没有车，揽来坐客就硬拿别人的车拉，有时拉不到目的地就对乘客翻脸敲钱。去年十一月二十四日，一个从济南来京的老太太，即被“搂包”程文明拉着往珠市口一带转了一圈，又拉回车站，并敲去了七百元。此外，他们还欺压正派的三轮车工人，如“搂包”吴绪明硬把三轮车工人吴文元所挣的一万元要了去。这类事情，时常发生。混到排子车工人中的“搂包”王树祥、金胖子、刁荪禄等，不但勾结特务段麻子，欺压、剥削其他工人，且独霸车站一带，不准别人揽生意。
    “搂包”中除开局聚赌，聚众行凶，强买强卖，借债不还等数不尽的罪恶外，“搂包”王树祥、赵宝林、金胖子、刁荪禄等十三人，还私自组织“工会”和“运输大队”等，阴谋混入搬运工人代表会中，并想买动个别工人代表，破坏工会组织。
    “锣车”也是混在三轮车工人中的三十多个地痞流氓。他们经常在车站上揽坐，乘机偷窃旅客东西；有时几个“锣车”包围一个行李多的旅客，拉拉扯扯，集体行窃。
    “猴车”是解放前专拉东交民巷外国人去嫖窑子，找暗娼，从中赚“跑合钱”的。解放后，都转到东单、米市大街一带热闹地区，成群结伙，不但霸占地段，欺压其他三轮车工人，且诱迫妇女卖淫，从中赚钱，并在大街上强拉客人，进行敲诈。
    京市广大市民对这些反动流氓组织的破坏革命秩序和压迫剥削劳动人民的罪恶行为一致表示愤怒，纷纷要求市公安局依法处理，该局接受了这一正义要求，于昨（十二）日起将其全部解散。
