　　Rapid Development of the Workers' Movement Across the Country
    Trade Unions Established in All Provinces and Cities
    Industrial Workers Being Organized Systematically
    [This newspaper dispatch] Under the correct leadership of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, and in the struggle against "leftist" and rightist deviations in work, the workers' movement in all liberated provinces and cities across the country has developed rapidly and achieved remarkable results. In terms of organizational work, formal trade unions or trade union preparatory committees have been universally established in all liberated provinces and cities across the country. Taking major cities such as Beijing, Tianjin, and Shanghai as examples, according to statistics: In Beijing, 83 formal trade unions and 125 preparatory committees have been established in the past year. Of the city's 390,605 workers and staff, 186,158 have been organized, accounting for 47.7 percent. In Tianjin, more than 179,000 workers have been organized, accounting for 59 percent of the city's total number of workers and staff, while industrial workers have been organized by over 87 percent. In Shanghai, 412 trade unions and 848 trade union preparatory committees have been established, and more than 930,000 workers have been organized, accounting for 87 percent of the city's workers and staff. More than 80 percent of Tangshan workers have also been organized. In order to adapt to the new situation of national centralization and unification, the All-China Federation of Trade Unions has further proposed the establishment of trade unions systematically according to the nature of the industry. It is required that, with the help of local trade unions, the national railway, coal mining, textile, postal, telecommunications, seafarers, electricity, hardware, shop assistants, food, and porter industries establish trade unions rapidly. At present, national worker representative meetings have been convened for the railway, coal mining, textile, postal, telecommunications, seafarers, and shop assistants industries, and preparatory committees have been established. The electricity and hardware industries have decided on dates to convene representative meetings. The National Congress of Porters' Unions concluded on February 6th, and the National Committee of Porters' Unions was officially established. The National Congress of Railway Workers will open today (7th), and a formal National Railway Union will be established at the congress. In terms of industry systems, more than 320,000 railway workers have been organized, accounting for 78 percent of the total number of railway workers. 349,405 textile workers have been organized, accounting for 75 percent of the more than 460,000 textile workers. More than 200,500 coal miners have been organized (excluding all regions in the Southwest and most regions in the Northwest), accounting for 60 percent of the existing 320,000 coal miners. The number of postal workers organized is relatively small. According to the 46,000 people already counted, more than 17,000 have been organized, accounting for 36 percent of the total. For these industries alone, the average number of workers organized accounts for more than 50 percent of the total number of workers. In the past year, there was a fairly widespread tendency towards closed-doorism in the national trade union work, which has now been basically overcome.
    Workers' Class Consciousness Raised, Material and Cultural Life Improved
    As workers across the country are gradually organized, the level of workers' consciousness has been raised. The material and cultural life has also been considerably improved. In terms of labor insurance, it has already been implemented in the Northeast, and is being piloted in various parts of North China. Workers' welfare undertakings are being gradually established throughout the country, and some regions are doing a very good job. Under the premise of rapidly restoring production, the Taiyuan Trade Union has established 70 public industrial canteens, 73 bathhouses, 39 barbershops, and 33 medical clinics. In terms of workers' education, political enlightenment education has been widely carried out in the past year through methods such as holding large classes, training courses, and general meetings. This has a significant effect on raising the class consciousness and sense of responsibility of the working class as masters, and giving play to the working enthusiasm of the working class. In the past year, some experience has been explored in establishing workers' spare-time schools. Although there are still many problems to be solved in terms of teaching materials, teachers, and school buildings, preliminary achievements have been made in this area. A large number of activists have emerged in the study, and a large number of cadres have been promoted.
    Oriented Towards Production, Leading Production, Greatly Improving Production Efficiency
    The pure welfare viewpoints in the minds of some trade union cadres are also being gradually corrected, and they are beginning to clarify the important issue that trade unions should be oriented towards production and lead production. Under such a guiding principle, workers in state-owned enterprises in various parts of the Northeast enthusiastically launched innovation record-breaking movements and rationalization proposals, implemented the responsibility system, and greatly improved production efficiency. For example, the "June 31st," "Iron Bull," and "Mao Zedong" locomotives, under the efforts of workers' research and creation, broke through two or three Class A inspection periods, creating new records of safe driving for 180,000 kilometers or 120,000 kilometers. Various new records have emerged continuously in state-owned enterprises in the Northeast. Waste has been reduced. State-owned factories in Tianjin, Taiyuan, and other places in North China are also constantly breaking through old production levels. In terms of private enterprises, both labor and management have further clarified the policy of developing production for the benefit of both labor and management. Many regions and industries have signed collective labor contracts and improved labor-management relations. Experience has shown that in all parts of the country, wherever the viewpoint of trade union leadership over production is clear, and democratic management systems have been established in various production units, workers' production enthusiasm is very high, and the face of production is also renewed.

　　全国各地工人运动突飞猛进
    各省市普遍建立工会
    各产业工人正按系统组织起来
    【本报讯】全国各地工人运动，在中华全国总工会的正确领导下，在与工作中“左”的和右的偏向斗争中迅速展开，并获得显著成绩。在组织工作上，全国已解放的各省市，普遍建立了正式工会或工会筹备会。以京、津、沪等大城市来说，据统计：北京一年来成立正式工会八十三个，筹备会一百二十五个，全市三十九万零六百零五个职工中，组织起来的已有十八万六千一百五十八人，占百分之四十七点七。天津已有十七万九千多工人组织起来，占全市职工总数的百分之五十九，而产业工人则组织起了百分之八十七强。上海建立起四百零十二个工会，和八百四十八个工会筹备会，已有九十三万多工人组织起来，占全市职工的百分之八十七。唐山工人也组织起来百分之八十以上。为了适应全国集中统一的新形势，全国总工会进一步提出按产业性质系统地建立工会。要求在地方工会帮助下，迅速将全国铁路、煤矿、纺织、邮政、电讯、海员、电业、五金、店员、食品、搬运等产业工会建立起来。现在已有铁路、煤矿、纺织、邮政、电讯、海员、店员等产业召开过全国工人代表会议，建立了筹备会。已决定日期召开代表会议的有电业、五金等产业。搬运工会全国代表大会已于二月六日结束，正式建立了搬运工会全国委员会。全国铁路工人代表大会今日（七日）开幕，在大会上即将产生正式的全国铁路工会。按产业系统来说，铁路工人已组织起了三十二万多人，占铁路工人总数的百分之七十八。纺织工人组织起来三十四万九千四百零五人，占全部纺织工人四十六万多人的百分之七十五。煤矿工人已组织起二十万零五千多人（西南全部地区、西北大部地区尚未统计在内），占现有三十二万煤矿工人的百分之六十。邮政工人组织起来的数字比较小，据已统计的四万六千多人中，也组织起了一万七千多人，占其全数的百分之三十六。就这几个产业说，已组织起来的工人平均占工人总数百分之五十以上。过去一年来在全国工会工作中，曾有一个时期相当普遍地存在关门主义倾向，现已基本被克服。
    工人阶级觉悟提高  物质文化生活改善
    随着全国工人逐渐组织起来，工人的觉悟程度提高了。文化物质生活亦有相当的提高和改善。在劳动保险方面，东北已经实行了，华北各地正在试行。全国各地工人福利事业在逐步建立，有些地区做的很好。太原工会在迅速恢复生产的前提下，建立公营工业食堂七十个、澡塘七十三个、理发室三十九个、医疗所三十三个。工人教育方面，过去一年来采用上大课、开训练班、开大会等方式，广泛地进行了政治启蒙教育，这对于提高工人阶级的阶级觉悟与主人翁的责任感，发挥工人阶级劳动热忱有着重大的作用。一年来开始摸索出了建立工人业余学校的一些经验。虽然目前教材、师资、校舍等方面还存在着很多问题未解决，但在这一方面已作出了初步成绩。在学习中涌现了不少的积极分子，提拔出了大批干部。
    面向生产领导生产  大大提高生产效率
    一部分工会干部思想上的单纯福利观点，也逐渐在纠正，并开始明确了工会要面向生产、领导生产这个重要问题。在这样一个思想指导原则下，东北各地公营企业工人，热烈展开创新纪录运动、合理化建议，实行了负责制，生产效率大大提高。如“六三一号”、“铁牛号”、“毛泽东号”机车，在工人们努力研究创造下，突破了两个、三个甲检期，而造成安全行驶十八万公里或十二万公里的新纪录。东北各公营企业各式各样的新纪录不断出现。浪费已减少。华北天津、太原等地公营工厂，亦不断突破旧的生产水平。在私营企业方面，劳资双方都进一步明确了发展生产劳资两利的方针。已有不少地区、不少行业，都签定了劳资集体合同，改善了劳资关系。经验证明：全国各地，凡是工会领导生产的观点明确，而各生产单位又建立起了民主管理制度的，工人生产情绪就都很高涨，生产面貌亦为之一新。（艾方）
