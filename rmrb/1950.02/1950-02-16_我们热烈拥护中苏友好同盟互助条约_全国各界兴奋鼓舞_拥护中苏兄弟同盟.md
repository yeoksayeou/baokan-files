　　We Warmly Endorse the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance, and Mutual Assistance
    People from All Walks of Life Across the Country are Excited and Encouraged, Supporting the Sino-Soviet Brotherly Alliance

    February 14, 1950, was a day of universal jubilation for the peace-loving people of the world, and a day of warm celebration for the people of China and the Soviet Union as they joined hands; however, the imperialists were greatly shaken. What kind of day was this? It was the day the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance, and Mutual Assistance was signed.
    More than a year ago, when Shenyang was not yet liberated, a friend of mine said to me: We China should implement communism, but we should not conclude an alliance or military treaty with the Soviet Union, so as not to cause a third world war; my reply was: A Sino-Soviet alliance treaty must be concluded in order to prevent the occurrence of a third world war; this must be a military alliance treaty for jointly defending against imperialist aggression again, and not for attacking others. This is a very simple matter of principle. The success of the Chinese people's revolution greatly strengthened the power of the world's people, and greatly weakened the power of world imperialism; but they are by no means willing to be eliminated, and will certainly do their best to struggle.
    The facts are already clearly before us. The Chinese revolution is about to achieve a comprehensive and final victory. The remnants of the Kuomintang reactionaries, raised by the head of imperialism—American imperialism—to be his lackeys, are like "fish in a cauldron," and their destruction is imminent. Imperialism is already trembling.
    Since our people's leader and head of state, Chairman Mao Zedong, arrived in the Soviet Union and was welcomed by the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries of Eastern Europe, it has caused the imperialists to develop hysterical symptoms, making all kinds of speculations based on their own chaotic psychology. They hope that China will produce a Tito, and hope that there will be conflicts between China and the Soviet Union; but their subconscious is clear, it is just fantasizing about such a thing from hopelessness.
    Now that the new curtain has been unveiled, the establishment of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance, and Mutual Assistance has laid a more solid foundation for world lasting peace. This is an unprecedented alliance in world history, and also a declaration that imperialism cannot save its collapse. How can it not tremble?
    There have been countless alliance treaties in the history of the old world, all of which are essentially aggressive. This is the essence of both sides of the alliance, and it is the reason for feudalism or imperialism. Both China and the Soviet Union are countries where the people are the masters, so of course the alliance between the two sides is entirely based on friendly relations, just like the Chinese custom of sworn brotherhood between people who share common interests. Therefore, this mutual assistance treaty is entirely a manifestation of full friendship. In fact, during the Chinese revolution and after the founding of the People's Republic of China, the friendship between China and the Soviet Union has been as true as brothers. This alliance is a concrete expression in writing.
    This mutual assistance treaty is mainly to jointly prevent Japan from invading again. After Japan surrendered, it no longer had the ability to invade, but its fascist groups have fallen into the arms of American imperialism, and the power of the Japanese people is still being suppressed. The situation of collusion between imperialism led by the United States and Japanese fascists has been seen and heard by the world. Although we have many sufficient reasons to believe that a third world war is unlikely to occur, we cannot but prepare for the eventuality.
    Therefore, this mutual assistance treaty is a concrete manifestation of friendly mutual assistance between China and the Soviet Union, and a strong guarantee for lasting world peace.
    In such an important sense, I believe that not only our Chinese and Soviet people extremely support it, but also all peace-loving people in the world will warmly endorse it.
    Long live the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance, and Mutual Assistance! Long live the people of China and the Soviet Union! Long live Chairman Mao Zedong! Long live Marshal Stalin!

　　我们热烈拥护中苏友好同盟互助条约
    全国各界兴奋鼓舞  拥护中苏兄弟同盟
    马叙伦
    一九五○年二月十四日，是世界爱好和平的人民万众一心欢呼的日子，也是中苏两国人民携手热烈庆祝的日子；可是，帝国主义者却大为发抖了。这是个什么日子？就是中苏友好同盟互助条约签定的日子。
    在一年多以前，沈阳还未解放的时候，我的一个朋友和我说：我们中国应该实行共产主义，但不可和苏联缔结同盟和军事性的条约，以免引起第三次世界大战；我的答复是：必须缔结中苏同盟条约，才可以防止第三次世界大战的发生；这必定是共同防御帝国主义再来侵略，而不是向人进攻的军事联盟条约。这是很浅近的事理，中国人民革命成功，世界人民的力量就大大地加强了，世界帝国主义的力量也就大大地减弱了；但他们决不甘心被消灭，而且必定尽力来挣扎。
    事实已显然摆在面前，中国革命正将取得全面的最后胜利，帝国主义头子——美帝国主义豢养着做他走狗的国民党反动残余，已如“釜底游魂”，消灭就在眼前，帝国主义已在发抖。
    自从我们人民的领袖、国家的元首毛泽东主席到了苏联，受到苏联和东欧各人民民主国家的欢迎，已使帝国主义者大发其歇斯底里的疯狂症状，凭他自己的错乱心理，作种种揣测。希望中国产生铁托，希望中苏发生纠葛；但他们的下意识上是清楚的，不过是从没有希望上幻想有这样的事。
    现在把新幕揭开了，中苏友好同盟互助条约的成立，把世界持久和平的基石更奠定得稳固了，这是世界历史上无前例的盟约，也是帝国主义不能挽救他的崩溃的宣告，他怎样能不发抖呢？
    旧世界历史上有无数的同盟条约，本质上都带有侵略性的，这是结盟订约的双方本质，是封建主义或帝国主义的原故。中苏两国都是人民作了主人的国家，当然双方的结盟，完全出于友好的关系，正如中国习俗，意气相投的便拜把一样。所以，这次互助条约，完全是充分友好的表现。其实，在中国革命过程中和中华人民共和国成立后，中苏的友谊，已真如兄弟一样，这次的盟约，乃是在文字上的具体表现。
    这次的互助条约，主要是共同防止日本再来侵略，日本在投降以后，本再无侵略的能力，但他的法西斯蒂集团已投入美帝国主义怀抱，日本人民的力量，还被压迫着。以美国为首的帝国主义和日本法西斯蒂勾结的情况，已为世界共见共闻，我们虽然有许多很充分的理由，相信不可能发生第三次世界大战，但我们不能不作万一的防备。
    所以，这个互助条约，在中苏是友好互助的具体表现，在世界是持久和平的坚强保障。
    在这样重大的意义上，我相信不但我们中苏人民都极端拥护，世界爱好和平的人民也没有不热烈拥护的。
    中苏友好同盟互助条约万岁！中苏两国人民万岁！毛泽东主席万岁！斯大林大元帅万岁！
