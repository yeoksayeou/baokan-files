　　Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, 10th. Bacteriologist Chen Wengui, who investigated and tested the plague bacteria released by the Japanese troops in Changde, Hunan in 1941, recently wrote an article describing his inspection process at the time and expressed his firm support for the Soviet proposal. Chen Wengui's article states: In 1941, when I was in charge of bacteriological testing at the Red Cross Rescue Headquarters in Guiyang and the wartime health personnel training center of the Kuomintang Military and Political Department, I received a telegram from Dr. Tan Xuehua from Changde and immediately led an epidemic prevention and testing team to investigate. I arrived in Changde on November 24, 1941, twenty-one days after Japanese planes dropped suspicious grains and wheat in the skies over Changde. That evening, a patient, Gong Chaosheng, was found to have a high fever and weakness in his limbs, followed by buboes, and died within twenty-four hours. On the 25th, an autopsy was performed at the isolation hospital, and it was found that the deceased had an enlarged spleen, blood spots on the surface of the liver, spleen, and intestines, and fluid accumulation in the chest cavity and pericardium. Samples of heart blood, smears of inguinal lymph nodes, liver, and spleen, and bacterial cultures using blood culture medium all revealed plague bacilli. Animal experiments with guinea pigs resulted in death within three days, confirming that the deceased was indeed infected with bubonic plague. At that time, according to our investigation, the first death from plague was discovered on the 12th (named Cai Tao'er, a girl, eleven years old), which fully conformed to the clinical diagnosis of plague, with an incubation period of about five to ten days and death within one or two days after onset. By the 24th, a total of seventeen deaths were known within just thirteen days (including six who were tested and confirmed to have plague). The places where plague was found and other suspicious locations were concentrated in Guanyue Temple, Jiya Lane, Guanmiao Street, and other places in Changde City where Japanese planes dropped the most infectious materials. Furthermore, the results of the analysis of the grains and wheat dropped by Japanese planes on November 4th, based on the principles of plague epidemiology, confirmed that they carried fleas with plague contagiousness and also found other bacteria. This fully proves the Japanese troops' heinous crime of using bacteriological warfare to exterminate humanity. The article continued: Generally, the spread of plague often follows the grain transportation lines. Changde is a rice-producing area, and the Japanese troops attempted to use this to spread the plague widely in China. Their cruelty and viciousness are outrageous! The inhumane atrocities of Hirohito and other war criminals must be punished, and new war makers must be given the lessons they deserve. Therefore, from the standpoint of a bacteriologist, I firmly support the Soviet proposal and am willing to participate in the special international military tribunal for the trial of Japanese bacterial war criminals as a witness to the Japanese troops' use of bacteriological weapons in China. It is noted that Chen Wengui is a bacteriologist who was invited by the former League of Nations Health Department in 1936 to study plague at the Haffkine Institute in Mumbai, India. He is currently the vice president and medical director of Chongqing Private Kuanren Hospital.

　　细菌学家陈文贵证实
    日寇曾在常德散鼠疫菌       
    图经产米区使毒菌蔓延
    【新华社重庆十日电】曾于一九四一年在湖南常德调查检验日寇施放鼠疫细菌的细菌学家陈文贵，顷撰文叙述其当时的检验经过，并表示坚决拥护苏联的提议。陈文贵的文章写道：一九四一年我在贵阳红十字会救护总队部及国民党军政部战时卫生人员训练所主持细菌检验工作时，接到谭学华医师由常德来的电报，即率领防疫检验队前往调查，于一九四一年十一月二十四日到达常德，距日寇飞机在常德上空投下可疑之谷麦等物相距二十一天。当晚发现病人龚操胜发高热，四肢无力，继发横痃，在二十四小时后即死亡。二十五日在隔离病院做尸体解剖，发现死者脾肿大，肝脾及肠表面有血斑，胸腔及心包膜积水。采取心血，用鼠蹊淋巴腺、肝及脾之涂片，和用血液培养基作细菌培养检查，都发现鼠疫杆菌。再以豚鼠作动物试验，三天即死，乃确定死者确系传染腺鼠疫。当时，根据我们的调查，从十二日起发现鼠疫第一名死者（名蔡桃儿，女孩，十一岁），与鼠疫临床诊断的潜伏期约五至十天、病发后一二日即死的规律，完全符合。至二十四日止，仅十三天内已知共死亡十七人（内经检查六人均系染鼠疫）。发现鼠疫的地方及其他可疑之处，均集中在日寇飞机投掷传染物最多的常德城内关岳庙、鸡鸭巷、关庙街等地。再从日寇飞机在十一月四日所投下之谷麦等物化验结果，根据鼠疫传染病学原理，确定其中带有鼠疫传染性之蚤，并发现其中有其他细菌。这就完全证实了日寇使用细菌战的灭绝人性的罪行。该文继称：一般情况，鼠疫之蔓延往往是沿粮食运输线的。常德正是产米区，日寇企图经此使鼠疫在中国广泛蔓延，其残忍毒辣，令人发指！裕仁等战犯这种惨无人道的暴行，我们必须加以惩罚，同时必须给新战争制造者以应有的教训。因此，我站在细菌学者的立场，坚决拥护苏联的提议，并愿意参加特别国际军事法庭对日本细菌战犯的审判，作为日寇在中国施用细菌武器的见证人。按陈文贵为细菌学家，一九三六年曾接受前国联卫生部之聘请，前往印度孟买哈夫金研究所研究鼠疫，现任重庆私立宽仁医院副院长兼医务主任。
