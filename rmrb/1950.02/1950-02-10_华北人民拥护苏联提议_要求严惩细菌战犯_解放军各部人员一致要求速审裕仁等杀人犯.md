Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 9th: People in Shanxi, Hebei, Chahar and other places unanimously demanded the trial of Japanese germ warfare criminals. He Mu, President of the Medical College of Shanxi University in Taiyuan, together with professors Yu Zaiji, Bao Shuhe, Yu Guoqi, Feng Shidi, Xu Jianzheng, Yang Xinyuan, Liu Zhihan, Fan Qingjiang, Wei Diao and more than 20 others jointly signed and issued a statement saying: The confessions of the Japanese germ warfare criminals on trial in Khabarovsk completely expose the evidence of the Japanese fascists' hatred of peace-loving people. Using bacteriological warfare to achieve their attempt to enslave all mankind is an unprecedented heinous crime. As medical workers, we strive for human happiness and firmly support the Soviet government's proposal. The Hebei Provincial Democratic Women's Federation, representing the women of the province, firmly demanded severe punishment for Japanese germ warfare criminals to avenge the compatriots who were killed. Zhang Qingchun, Director of the Provincial Federation of Trade Unions, Yu Li, Vice President of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association Branch, and Hu Su, Director of the Federation of Literary and Art Circles, all believed that the Soviet Union's exposure of the heinous crimes of these Japanese war criminals is in stark contrast to the US government's condoning of Japanese war criminals. Workers, students, suburban farmers and industrialists and businessmen in Baoding City also unanimously supported the Soviet government's proposal. Worker Wang Xingxun said: Anyone who does not agree with this solemn proposal proves that he wants to protect Japanese war criminals. The Chahar Province and Zhangjiakou City Federation of Trade Unions, Women's Federation, Communist Youth League Working Committee, Democratic Youth Federation, and Student Federation and other people's organizations jointly issued a statement saying: Unless those Japanese criminals who frantically prepared for bacteriological warfare are tried one by one, human justice cannot be upheld and world peace cannot be maintained.
