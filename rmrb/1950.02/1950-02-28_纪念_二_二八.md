　　Commemorating the "February 28th" Incident

　　The "February 28th" Incident was an event in which the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang continued the brutal practices of Japanese fascist bloody rule, carrying out a large-scale massacre of the Taiwanese people.
　　The "February 28th" Incident was also a heroic struggle by the Taiwanese people to fight for democracy and freedom and to resist the brutal rule of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang.
　　The struggle of the Taiwanese people for liberation is a link in the struggle of all the Chinese people for liberation and is inseparable from the cause of the liberation struggle of all the Chinese people.
　　The "February 28th" Incident has now been three years ago.
　　In the past three years, the People's Liberation War has achieved victory on the Chinese mainland, and imperialism and Chinese reactionary forces have been basically eliminated from the Chinese mainland. However, the remaining Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang is still entrenched in Taiwan and is still vainly attempting to maintain its reactionary rule by relying on the aid of American imperialism and the exploitation and oppression of the Taiwanese people.
　　Therefore, the suffering of the Taiwanese people has deepened, the task of the Taiwanese people's struggle has become more arduous, and the sympathy and love of the people of the whole country for the Taiwanese compatriots and the concern and admiration for the Taiwanese people's struggle against the reactionaries have risen to an unparalleled degree.
　　American imperialism and the remnants of Japanese fascism are carrying out conspiracies to hinder our liberation of Taiwan and even vainly attempt to split Taiwan from the Chinese mainland. We must thoroughly defeat this conspiracy.
　　The heroic struggle of the Taiwanese people on February 28, 1947, is of great historical significance. We must mobilize the power of the people of the whole country to support the war to liberate Taiwan and completely eliminate the remaining Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang to accomplish this historical task.

　　纪念“二·二八”
　　谭平山
    “二·二八”事件，是蒋介石匪帮继续日本法西斯血腥统治的残暴作风，对台湾人民进行大规模屠杀的一次事件。
    “二·二八”事件，也是台湾人民争取民主自由、反抗蒋介石匪帮残暴统治的一次英勇斗争。
    台湾人民争取解放的斗争，是全中国人民争取解放斗争中的一环，是与全中国人民的解放斗争事业不可分的。
    “二·二八”事件，到今天已满三周年了。
    三年来，人民解放战争已在中国大陆上取得了胜利，帝国主义与中国反动势力已自中国大陆基本上消灭，可是蒋介石残余匪帮，现在还盘据着台湾，还妄想凭借美帝的援助以及对台湾人民的剥削与压榨，来维持其反动统治。
    因此台湾人民的苦难更加深了，台湾人民的斗争任务更加艰巨了，而全国人民对台湾同胞的同情与热爱、对于台湾人民与反动派搏斗的关切与钦敬，也已高涨到无可比拟的程度了。
    美帝国主义与日本法西斯残余正进行着阻碍我们解放台湾，乃至妄想将台湾自中国本土分裂的阴谋。我们要彻底击溃这种阴谋。
    一九四七年二月二十八日台湾人民英勇斗争，是具有很重要的历史意义的，我们要动员全国人民的力量，支援解放台湾战争，彻底消灭蒋介石残余匪帮，来完成这一个历史任务。
