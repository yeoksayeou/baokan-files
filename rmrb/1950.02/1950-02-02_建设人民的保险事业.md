　　Building the People's Insurance Enterprise
    Yán Dáyín
    With the birth of New China, a people's insurance enterprise - the People's Insurance Company of China - was also born. The establishment of the People's Insurance Company of China marks a new historical stage for China's insurance industry. Because the establishment of the people's insurance business first eliminated the reactionary, comprador, and detached-from-production phenomena of the past Chinese insurance industry, creating a new direction to serve the New Democratic economic program. In simple terms, it overthrew the old insurance system and created a new insurance system.
    China's old insurance industry was very weak. Compared with the imperialist foreign companies that invaded our country, its ability to bear insurance was 30 times smaller in fire insurance and 60 times smaller in marine insurance. Therefore, Chinese companies had to rely mainly on the reinsurance of foreign companies to survive, acting as brokers for foreign companies. Therefore, it was determined that the former Chinese companies would inevitably carry reactionary and comprador characteristics. Naturally, the formation of this situation was mainly due to the traitorous policy of the Kuomintang reactionary ruling class. National sovereignty could not be independent, and the insurance market was completely controlled by imperialism. Secondly, the so-called state-owned companies of the Kuomintang reactionary government were completely controlled by the four major families. The real private national insurance industry was not allowed to develop. Therefore, both state-owned and private companies completely deviated from production, with the sole purpose of making money, and there was a serious irrational and deformed development.
    Although the insurance business has had a history of more than 50 years in China, it is still pitifully poor in terms of theoretical research and data work on this science. Even the technology is completely copied from imperialist countries. This makes many people in China still have a wrong understanding of insurance, thinking that insurance is gambling and exploitation. With the development of the entire revolutionary situation, the cities were liberated by our army, and the so-called state-owned companies of bureaucratic capital were taken over by us. After market management, many private insurance businesses also began to be eliminated. In order to build a new democratic insurance business, the People's Insurance Company of China was born under such needs. What is the construction policy of the New Democratic People's Insurance Enterprise? What are its characteristics? According to personal understanding, there are the following points:
    (1) The basic task of the New Democratic People's Insurance Enterprise is to serve the development of production and the prosperity of the economy, to assist in the fastest possible restoration of production and to ensure the uninterrupted progress of production, and also to provide protection against various accidental losses in the production process. For example, if a production organization has a production plan, the realization of this production plan will become a problem, or even completely impossible, if an unforeseeable disaster occurs. For example, in fire insurance, if a factory is burned down due to management negligence or carelessness elsewhere, the factory's equipment and materials may be destroyed in an instant. If there is insurance, compensation and recovery can be obtained through the insurance company. Under the premise of implementing economic accounting system and gradually moving towards a planned economy, all expenses must have an accurate budget. However, the loss of accidental disasters cannot be budgeted. The role of insurance is to turn the unpredictable accidental loss into a clear and fixed insurance premium. Once insured, the insurance company is responsible for checking the safety equipment of the insured enterprise. In December last year, the Financial and Economic Committee of the State Council made an important decision: The People's Insurance Company of China is a state-run insurance business that handles marine insurance, fire insurance, and other businesses. Its purpose is mainly to protect and develop production and protect the welfare of workers. After various enterprises are insured, on the one hand, they can often receive guidance and inspection from the insurance company on safety equipment, so that the possibility of losses to the production business is reduced; on the other hand, in case of losses, they can also receive due compensation, so that production can continue. Therefore, this is an important link in strengthening the economic accounting system of various enterprise departments. In order to ensure that various enterprises can safely carry out production and that state property is not subject to accidental losses, it is specifically decided: 1. All state-owned and public enterprises and warehouses in various places must be insured with the People's Insurance Company of China and its agencies, and accept the guidance and supervision of the insurance company on insurance equipment. 2. This insurance cost is allowed to be included in the production cost. This correct decision is also a major task of the People's Insurance Enterprise. Naturally, other state property and private enterprise property are also within the scope of insurance. In addition, guaranteeing agricultural production, insurance for livestock, agricultural crop disasters, and crop harvests is also the direction of future business development. Secondly, before the widespread implementation of social labor insurance, personal insurance for workers must also be handled in a planned manner. In summary, the New Democratic People's Insurance Enterprise has three main tasks: A. Protect and develop production, promote the exchange of materials between urban and rural areas, and cooperate with the development of domestic and foreign trade; B. Guarantee the welfare of the working people; C. Protect state property.
    (2) It would be wrong to think that the New Democratic insurance system only passively protects the property of the New Democracy, or only restores the productive forces destroyed by various disasters. In fact, the New Democratic insurance business also has a more active and positive role, that is, to accumulate a large amount of social funds through insurance and strive to invest in construction and production or allocate them to the state budget. Naturally, the way to invest in production may not be direct. Article 49 of the Organizational Regulations of the People's Insurance Company of China stipulates that 30 percent of its surplus, after deducting public reserve funds and reserves, shall be submitted to the government. But all government construction is also for the purpose of guaranteeing production.
    (3) The combination of insurance and disaster prevention work is an important feature of the New Democratic insurance business. The New Democratic insurance business is to change the past passive ex-post compensation and purely profit-making practices. For example, in the past insurance institutions, the organization of the reinsurance part was extremely large, the procedures were quite complicated, and a lot of manpower and material resources were wasted. Its main purpose was to conduct reinsurance with imperialist foreign companies. However, the institutions and talents in the real business aspects were extremely lacking. The focus of the People's Insurance Company's institutions is on business institutions. It will train a large number of business personnel to conduct prior investigations, suggestions, and post-event inspection and supervision services. At the same time, we must also allocate a part of the insurance premiums received to be used as expenses to strengthen safety devices. The Tianjin People's Insurance Company once donated half of the insurance premiums received from underwriting the Industrial Exhibition to the government's fire brigade. The articles of the insurance charter also stipulate that different insurance rates shall be determined according to the situation of safety equipment. For example, an enterprise can enjoy the preferential treatment of low rates after it accepts the insurance company's opinions and improves its safety equipment. The above are all important measures to implement an active prevention system.
    (4) With a clear attitude towards private insurance companies, the government allows them to exist and develop. The government's policy towards them is to transform and unite them, so that they can break off their dependence on imperialism and turn to serving production, and abolish their improper management methods. Therefore, private insurance companies should have sufficient funds as the basis for credit. The use of funds and insurance premiums can be calculated on a real basis when deposited in the bank; they can also be freely invested in production businesses or purchased in securities. After getting rid of the connection with imperialist foreign companies, necessary reinsurance support can also be made.
    (5) In terms of foreign relations, New China's insurance companies should establish contact with socialist countries, the Soviet Union, and the New Democratic countries of Eastern Europe. On the one hand, it should cooperate with the establishment of trade relations with these countries, and on the other hand, it should learn from the Soviet insurance system. The Soviet Union is now the most developed country in the world in insurance. Insurance institutions are widespread throughout the country and penetrate into rural areas. The state treats insurance as a social policy. The scientific theory of insurance has been fully developed in the Soviet Union, and insurance has become a modern and progressive economic system. In imperialist countries, insurance is used as a tool of exploitation domestically, and it is subordinate to its economic aggression policy abroad. Therefore, we can only consider one thing for foreign companies of imperialism in China, that is, to carry out necessary exchange insurance business when it is possible to establish trade relations on an equal and mutually beneficial basis. All the situations in the past, all the privileges in my country's insurance market should be changed.
    The above points are the basic policies for building a New Democratic People's Insurance Enterprise in the future, and also the main characteristics of the new insurance business. In order to realize such a policy, it is necessary to build a national unified and centralized state insurance institution, so as to concentrate a large number of talents and quickly deploy a national insurance network to meet the arrival of the national economic upsurge. This is also the work that the People's Insurance Company of China is doing.

　　建设人民的保险事业
    阎达寅
    随着新中国的诞生，一个人民的保险事业——中国人民保险公司也产生了。中国人民保险公司之成立，标志着中国保险事业从此走上了一个新的历史阶段，因为人民保险事业的创立，首先肃清了以往中国保险业之反动性、买办性与脱离生产的现象，创造了为新民主主义的经济纲领而服务的新方向。简单的说，就是打倒了旧的保险制度，创造了新的保险制度。
    中国旧的保险业，实力非常脆弱，承受保险额的能力如与帝国主义侵入我国的外商公司比较，外商在火险方面要大三十倍，水险要大六十倍；因之华商公司不得不主要地依靠外商公司的分保来生存，去当外商公司的经纪人。因此也就决定了以往的华商公司必然会带着反动性与买办性。自然，这种形势的造成，主要由于国民党反动统治阶级卖国求荣的政策所致，国家主权不能自主，保险市场亦全被帝国主义所控制。其次是国民党反动政府的所谓国营公司，完全成为四大家族所控制，对真正的私营民族保险业不允许其发展，因之，无论国营和私营都完全离开了生产，单以赚钱为目的，存在着严重的不合理的畸形发展。
    保险事业在中国虽已有了五十年以上的历史，但对这门科学，无论在理论研究上，资料工作上，还是贫乏得可怜，即使技术上也完全是从帝国主义国家搬来的一套，这样就使得保险业在中国，许多人都还残存着一种错误的认识，认为保险是赌博，是剥削。随着整个革命形势的发展，城市为我军解放，官僚资本的所谓国营公司为我接管，经过市场管理，不少私人保险业，也开始被淘汰。为建设新民主主义的保险事业，中国人民保险公司就在这种需要情况下产生了。什么是新民主主义人民保险事业的建设方针呢？它有那些特点呢？根据个人认识有以下几点：
    （一）新民主主义的人民保险事业，其基本任务是为发展生产，繁荣经济而服务，是为协助最快的恢复生产，并保证生产之不间断进行，也是为预防在生产过程中种种意外损失的保障。譬如一个生产机构有了生产计划，如果万一发生了不可逆料的灾害，这种生产计划的实现就成了问题，甚至完全不能实现。如火灾保险，假定某工厂因管理疏忽，或别处失慎延烧，均可能把厂房设备物资，瞬息付之一炬。如果有了保险，则可通过保险公司获得赔偿与恢复。在实行经济核算制逐渐走向计划经济的前提下，什么经费，都要有精确的预算。但是意外灾害的损失是无法预算的，保险的作用，便是把无法预算的意外损失，变成明确而固定的保险费。一经保险以后，保险公司负有检查该被保险企业安全设备之责。去年十二月政务院财政经济委员会有一个重要的决定：中国人民保险公司是国家经营的保险事业，举办水险火险等业务，其目的主要是保护与发展生产，并保护劳动人员之福利。各种企业保险后，一方面可经常得到保险公司对安全设备之指导与检查，使生产事业遭受损失之可能减少；另一方面万一遭受损失，亦可得到应有之赔偿，使生产得以继续，所以这是各企业部门加强经济核算制的重要一环。为使各种企业能安全地进行生产与国家财产不致遭受意外损失起见，特决定：一、各地国营公营企业及仓库，均须到中国人民保险公司及其代理机构进行保险，并接受保险公司有关保险设备之指导与监督。二、此项保险费用，准予列入生产成本内。这一正确决定，也就是人民保险事业的一个主要任务。自然对国家之其他财产以及私人企业财产，也都是保险的范围。此外对农业生产之保障，关于牲畜、农作物灾害及作物收获的保险，也是今后开展业务之方向。其次，在社会劳动保险未普遍推行之前，对劳动人民之人身保险也要有计划的办理。总起来说，新民主主义人民保险事业有三个主要任务：Ａ、保护与发展生产，促进城乡物资交流，以配合发展国内外贸易；Ｂ、保障劳动人民的福利；Ｃ、保护国家财产。
    （二）如果以为新民主主义的保险制度只是消极地保护新民主主义的财产，或者只以恢复各种因灾害所破坏的生产力为限，那是错误的。实际上新民主主义的保险事业，还日有更积极正面的作用，即用保险的方式大量积聚社会资金，努力投于建设生产或拨充国家预算。自然投入生产的方式可能不是直接的，这点在中国人民保险公司组织条例第四十九条规定其盈余除提出公积金及准备金外，有百分之三十是提交政府。但政府的一切建设也是为着保障生产。
    （三）保险和防灾工作结合，是新民主主义保险事业之重要特征。新民主主义的保险事业，是要转变过去消极的事后赔偿与单纯营利作法的，如过去的保险机构，分保部分的组织异常庞大，手续相当繁杂，浪费很多人力物力，其主要目的，是为了与帝国主义的外商公司进行分保；而真正业务方面的机构和人才却异常缺乏，而人民保险公司的机构，重点是在业务机构。它将培养大批的业务人员，以进行事先调查、建议及事后检查监督等服务工作，同时我们还要将收入的保费分出一部分来，充作加强安全装置的费用。天津人民保险公司曾将承保工业展览会收入保费之半数，捐作政府消防队之经费。在保险章程的条文里，还规定了根据安全设备的情形分别订定不同的保险费率，譬如一个企业，在安全设备上，接受了保险公司的意见进行改善以后，他可以享受低费率的优待。诸如上述，都是执行积极的预防制度的重要措施。
    （四）对私营保险公司具有明确的态度，政府是允许其存在与发展的，政府对它是改造与团结的政策，使其打断依赖帝国主义的关系，以转向服务于生产，取缔其不正当的经营方法。因此私营保险公司应有足够资金，作为信用的基础。资金与保费的运用，可以在存入银行时，给予折实计算；也可自由向生产事业投资，或购买证券。在摆脱对帝国主义外商之联系后，亦可作必要之分保支持。
    （五）对国外关系，新中国的保险公司应建立与社会主义国家苏联及东欧新民主主义国家的联系，一方面配合与这些国家贸易关系之建立，一方面学习苏联的保险制度。苏联现在是世界上保险最发达的国家，保险机构普遍于全国，并深入农村，国家是把保险作为社会政策来推行。保险的科学理论，在苏联获得了充分的发展，保险已成为一种近代进步的经济制度。而在帝国主义国家，保险在国内是作为剥削的工具，对国外则是服从于其经济侵略政策的。因此我们对帝国主义在中国的外商公司，只能考虑到一点，即可能在平等互惠的立场建立贸易关系时，来进行必要的交换保险业务。过去的一切形势，在我国内保险市场的种种特权均应改变。
    以上数点，就是今后建设新民主主义人民保险事业的基本方针，也就是新的保险事业主要特征。为了实现这样的方针，必须建设一个全国的统一的集中的国家保险机构，以便大量集中人材，迅速地布置一个全国的保险网，以迎接全国经济高潮的到来，这也就是中国人民保险公司正在进行的工作。
