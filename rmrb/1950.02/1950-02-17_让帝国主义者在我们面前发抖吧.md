Let the Imperialists Tremble Before Us
    Qian Junrui

    Today, a major event has occurred in the world. This event is like a bolt from the blue for the imperialists. It can scare the likes of Truman and Acheson out of their wits. It is once again fundamentally shaking the already dilapidated imperialist system.

    This event is the signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance, and Mutual Assistance between the People's Republic of China and the Soviet Union.

    The signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance, and Mutual Assistance first opened a new era in the history of friendly relations between the Chinese and Soviet peoples.

    In the long years before the October Revolution, the common people of old Russia and old China were both in a state of slavery, with barbaric feudal landlords as the main rulers. The reactionary ruling classes of both countries were keen on provoking and inciting national hatred. From the 19th century onwards, Tsarist Russia implemented a long-term policy of aggression against China. In such dark times, the Chinese and Russian people had no conflict of interest, but they were submerged in the slander and provocation of the Chinese and Russian reactionary ruling groups, and had no conditions to express and develop friendship. Only advanced people saw the essence of this relationship. As early as the time of the Boxer Rebellion, the great Lenin pointed out: "The Chinese do not hate the European people, because there is no conflict between them. What they hate are the European capitalists and the European governments that obey the capitalists." He described the relationship between the Chinese and Russian people at that time: "The Chinese, no matter what, have never squeezed out the Russians; the Chinese themselves, like the Russians, suffer from an Asian-style government (which extorts taxes from hungry farmers and uses force to suppress any aspirations for freedom), and suffer from the oppression of capital – which has invaded China." He loudly opposed the Tsarist government's aggression against China, denounced: "The policy of the Russian Tsar's government in China is a criminal policy," and called on workers to rise up and "use all their strength to oppose those who provoke national hatred and divert the attention of the working people from their true enemies." ("The War in China")

    The Xinhai Revolution aroused the Russian proletariat's infinite sympathy and admiration for the Chinese people. In January 1912, the Second Congress of the Russian Bolsheviks made a special resolution for the Chinese revolution, pointing out that China's "revolutionary struggle will liberate Asia and destroy the rule of the European bourgeoisie," and "shows that the Russian proletariat is watching the success of the Chinese revolutionary people with sincere excitement and full sympathy; and denounces the actions of Russian liberals who support the Tsarist imperialist policy." Lenin praised the Chinese people as a "truly great people" at that time. He said: "This great people is not only good at lamenting their long-term slavery, not only good at dreaming of freedom and equality, but also good at fighting against China's long-term oppressors." ("Chinese Democracy and Populism")

    The reactionary ruling groups were dedicated to internal oppression and external aggression or betrayal, and they tried their best to provoke mutual national hatred; the friendship between the two peoples could not be expressed and developed. Only the advanced proletariat of Russia recognized the true relationship between the two peoples and expressed their deep fighting friendship with the Chinese people. This is the basic characteristic of the relationship between China and Russia in the dark days when the Chinese and Russian people were in the dark days before the October Revolution.

    The great October Revolution fundamentally changed this relationship from one aspect. After this, the Russian working people rose to the position of masters. They gained the possibility to freely and fully express their friendship with the Chinese people, and gained the possibility to provide moral and material assistance to the Chinese people through state organs. The Soviet Union issued a declaration as soon as it was founded, automatically abolishing all the imperialist privileges of the Tsarist era in China. In July 1919, the Soviet government issued a declaration to China, saying: "We are very willing to help the movement of all the nations of the East, especially the Chinese people, to get rid of the imperialist military and financial fetters. We not only want to rescue the working class of the Soviet Union, but also want to rescue the Chinese people." After continuous struggle, the Soviet Union finally signed the Sino-Russian Agreement with the then Beiyang warlord government in China in 1924, abolishing all the privileges of Tsarist Russia in China. Then the Soviet Union helped the Chinese people's liberation movement ideologically, morally and materially, and promoted the vigorous Chinese First Great Revolution of 1925-27. Later, Chiang Kai-shek betrayed the revolution and kicked away the friendship of the Soviet Union, which resulted in the unbridled aggression of Japanese imperialism. But even then, the Soviet Union insisted on a friendly attitude towards the Chinese people. As early as after the September 18th Incident, the Soviet Union warned Japan and said: "The Soviet Union is completely sympathetic to China morally, spiritually and emotionally, and is willing to provide all necessary assistance." In 1937, Japanese imperialism launched a full-scale attack on China. In August, the Soviet Union signed a non-aggression pact with China, helping us with many airplanes, artillery, aviators, military experts, and hundreds of millions of dollars in loans. Chiang Kai-shek, however, passively resisted Japan, and kicked away the friendship of the Soviet Union again, launching three anti-communist upsurges, causing great difficulties in the War of Resistance Against Japan.

    However, the Soviet Union has consistently adhered to a friendly attitude towards the Chinese people. On August 9, 1945, three months after the Soviet Red Army defeated the German fascist bandits, it sent troops to the Northeast and wiped out one million of the main force of the Japanese Army, the Kwantung Army, forcing Japanese imperialism to declare unconditional surrender. The "Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship and Alliance" was signed on August 14, by which China and the Soviet Union jointly prevented the resurgence of Japanese aggression forces. Chiang Kai-shek, however, wholeheartedly relied on American imperialism, and kicked away the friendship of the Soviet Union again, launching a large-scale anti-communist and anti-people civil war.

    The great Stalin made a classic explanation of the true basis of this deep friendship between the Soviet Union and the Chinese people as early as 1925. He said: "The power of the Chinese revolutionary movement is immeasurable, and this power has not been able to make itself properly felt. But it will certainly make itself felt in the future, and the rulers of the East and the West who do not see this power and do not give it due consideration will suffer greatly because of it. ... Here, truth and justice are entirely on the side of the Chinese revolution. That is why we now and in the future sympathize with the Chinese revolution, sympathize with the Chinese people's struggle for liberation from the shackles of imperialism, and unite China into a whole country."

    This is the situation on the Soviet side after the October Revolution, and this is one aspect of the Sino-Soviet relations.

    What about the Chinese side? The October Revolution awakened the Chinese people, helped the Chinese people find Marxism-Leninism, and organized the most loyal leader of their liberation cause - the Communist Party of China. The Soviet Union's assistance and the leadership of the Communist Party made the Chinese working people enthusiastically love socialist Soviet Union and regard it as their most reliable and closest friend. During the First Great Revolution, almost all the workers, peasants and advanced intellectuals in China loved and yearned for the Soviet Union. During the ten years of civil war, the vast number of peasants in the revolutionary base areas and the revolutionary workers and revolutionary intellectuals in the cities ruled by the Kuomintang sincerely thanked the Soviet Union for its sympathy and support during the most difficult days of the revolution, resolutely opposed the anti-Soviet conspiracies of the imperialists and the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, and in such struggles, they paid the blood and heads of many patriots under the knives of the imperialists and Kuomintang reactionaries. During the War of Resistance Against Japan, the broad masses of the Chinese people, relying on their own eyes, ears, and brains, recognized the Soviet Union's sincere help to the Chinese people. In the anti-Japanese democratic base areas under the leadership of the Communist Party, they were fully able to express their love and gratitude to the Soviet Union and Stalin. This deep feeling of the Chinese people was fully expressed in Chairman Mao's speech at the celebration of Stalin's sixtieth birthday in 1939. He said: "Thanks to the victory of Stalin's cause, he helped us with many airplanes, artillery, aviators, military advisers in various war zones, and loans. Which country in the world has helped us like this? Which class, which party, which person-led country in the world has helped us like this? Besides the Soviet Union, besides the proletariat, besides the Communist Party, besides Stalin, who else?" Chairman Mao also said: "The Chinese people will never forget all this friendship from the Soviet Union." However, in the areas ruled by the Kuomintang reactionaries, this feeling of the Chinese people was seriously crushed and suppressed. There, the imperialists and the Chiang Kai-shek reactionaries' despicable and shameless rumors and slanders against the Soviet Union, like poisonous insects, damaged the kind hearts of the Chinese people. Especially after Chiang Kai-shek's bandit gang launched a large-scale counter-revolutionary civil war in 1946, this group of American imperialist lackeys, this group of traitors and butchers, even more fabricated all kinds of extremely despicable and shameless rumors around the so-called "Zhang Xinfu Incident", the so-called "China Eastern Railway issue", the "Lushun Dalian issue", the "Outer Mongolia issue", the "Xinjiang issue" etc., to slander and smear the Soviet Union, and to injure and provoke the feelings between the Chinese and Soviet people. As a result, as the Chinese saying goes, "those who commit many sins will perish themselves," this group of traitors and murderers, this Chiang Kai-shek group, whose crimes were heinous, has been basically overthrown under the iron fists of the Chinese People's Liberation Army and the Chinese people under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party.

    The victory of the Chinese people created the new People's Republic of China. In this country, as in the Soviet Union, the people became the masters of their own country. Obstacles that stood in the way of friendly cooperation between the Chinese and Soviet peoples have been swept away. The Soviet government immediately announced the establishment of diplomatic relations with us the day after the founding of the new China. The Soviet cultural delegation immediately came to the new China. A large number of Soviet experts came to Beijing and other places, sincerely and selflessly helping us carry out economic and cultural construction. The Sino-Soviet Friendship Association was established, and in just four months, the number of members of the Friendship Association developed to more than two million. Soviet experts, as well as Soviet films, pictures, dramas, and scientific works, are widely and warmly welcomed in the new China. All of this shows the rapid development and consolidation of Sino-Soviet friendly relations under the new situation. Here, the people of both countries, in the position of masters of their own countries, respect each other, help each other, and love each other. Here, the great people of the two great countries, China and the Soviet Union, can express their deep fraternal friendship to each other without any restraint, without any worries, and without any limitations, and further develop and consolidate this friendship. Now, such deep friendship and sincere unity between the Chinese and Soviet people have been determined and consolidated by the signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance and other agreements by the governments of China and the Soviet Union. This has opened a new era in Sino-Soviet friendly relations.

    The new era of Sino-Soviet friendly relations is the most glorious, supreme, and invincible.

    This is first because the great people of our two great countries, China and the Soviet Union, under the leadership of the Communist Party, under the leadership of the great Stalin and the great Mao Zedong, have made long-term heroic and arduous struggles for their own liberation and the cause of democracy and peace for all mankind. Truth and justice are on our side. Our signing of this Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance and other agreements is, as Vyshinsky said, "a most important contribution to consolidating the cause of world peace and democracy."

    Secondly, it is because the foundation of Sino-Soviet friendship is that the people of both countries are the masters of their own countries. Because of this, this friendship is a true friendship of the people, a friendship that can be fully expressed and fully developed, a friendship that is truly based on the interests of the people of both countries, not on the interests of a small number of people in one country, so this friendship can most completely and to the highest degree embody the beautiful hopes of the people of both countries and the people of the world.

    Finally, the great friendship between China and the Soviet Union itself represents an incomparably powerful force. China and the Soviet Union are the two largest countries in the world, bordering each other and with the richest resources. The population of the two countries is nearly 700 million, exceeding one-third of the world's population. And these 700 million people are both brave, diligent, and intelligent people, especially the Soviet people, who are the most advanced people in the world, who have been tempered and tempered for a long time under the cultivation of Marxism-Leninism. The people of China and the Soviet Union have the leadership of a completely mature Bolshevik Communist Party, they have such outstanding and great Stalin and Mao Zedong as their wise leaders and mentors, and they have the invincible Soviet Army and the Chinese People's Liberation Army, who fully understand their glorious mission, as their fully qualified guards. Now these two great countries and great peoples have formed a friendly alliance. The Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance specifically stipulates that: "The two contracting parties guarantee to jointly exert all necessary measures to prevent the re-aggression and sabotage of peace by Japan or any other country that directly or indirectly colludes with Japan in aggressive acts. Once either contracting party is attacked by Japan or a country allied with Japan and is thus in a state of war, the other contracting party shall immediately provide military and other assistance with all its strength." At the same time, it is stipulated that: "The two contracting parties shall, in accordance with the interests of consolidating peace and universal security, conduct mutual consultations on all major international issues related to the common interests of China and the Soviet Union." What a unity! What a sublimity! What a power!

    Let the imperialists and all their lackeys tremble before our invincible brotherly alliance! American imperialism has recently made special efforts to implement its major strategic policy of undermining Sino-Soviet friendship. Now it has obviously suffered a major defeat in the face of the people of the world. And we, the Chinese people, the Soviet people, and the people of the world, have also won a great victory here for the consolidation of world peace. The world democratic peace camp has become even stronger after the signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance. All democratic and peace-loving fighters in the world will get a new guarantee and strength from this, so as to despise those outwardly strong but inwardly weak imperialists more strategically, and thus cautiously and bravely overthrow them.
 一九五○、二、一五北京. (February 15, 1950, Beijing)

　　让帝国主义者在我们面前发抖吧
    钱俊瑞
    今天，世界上发生了一件大事。这件事，对帝国主义者来说，是晴天起了个霹雳。它可以吓破杜鲁门、艾奇逊们的胆。它再一次从根本上摇动了业已残破了的帝国主义体系。
    这件事就是中华人民共和国和苏联签订了友好同盟互助条约。
    中苏友好同盟互助条约的签订，首先在中苏两国人民的友好关系史上开辟了新的时代。
    在十月革命以前的漫长年月里，旧俄国和旧中国的老百姓都处于奴隶的地位，野蛮的封建大地主是主要的统治者。两国的反动统治阶级都热衷于挑拨和煽动民族的仇恨。从十九世纪起，帝俄就长期地实行对中国的侵略政策。在这样的黑暗时期里，中俄两国人民本来没有利害的冲突，但都被淹没在中俄反动统治集团的挑拨中伤之中，得不到表达和发展友谊的条件。只是先进的人们看清了这种关系的本质。早在义和团事件时，伟大的列宁就指出：“中国人并不是嫉恶欧洲人民，因为他们彼此之间并未有何种冲突，他们所嫉恶的乃是欧洲的资本家和服从资本家的欧洲各国政府。”他描写当时中俄两国人民的关系道：“中国人无论怎样，从来就未排挤过俄国人；中国人自己亦如同俄国人一样，受着亚洲式的政府（它从饥饿的农民身上敲诈贡税，并用武力来压制争取自由的任何志向）的痛苦，受着资本压迫的痛苦——它已侵入了中国。”他大声疾呼，反对沙皇政府对中国的侵略，指斥：“俄皇政府在中国的政策乃是一种犯罪的政策”，号召工人们起来“用全力反对那些挑拨民族仇恨和转移劳动人民对其真正敌人注意的人。”（《中国的战争》）
    辛亥革命引起了俄国无产阶级对中国人民无限的同情和敬仰。一九一二年一月，俄国的布尔塞维克第二次代表会议特别为中国革命作出了决议，指出中国“这个革命斗争将使亚洲获得解放，而摧毁欧洲资产阶级的统治。”并“表明俄国无产阶级以衷诚的兴奋和充分的同情，注视中国革命的人民之成功；斥责那支持沙皇主义侵略政策的俄国自由主义的行为。”列宁在当时就颂扬中国人民是“真正伟大的人民，”他说：“这个伟大的人民不仅善于悲叹自己的长期的奴隶制度，不仅善于梦想自由平等，而且还善于同中国的长期压迫者作斗争。”（《中国的民主主义与民粹主义》）
    反动统治集团专心致志于对内的压迫和对邻国的侵略或出卖，他们尽力挑拨相互间的民族仇恨；两国人民的友谊，无从表达和发展，只有俄国先进的无产阶级认识了两国人民的真正的关系，并表达了自己对中国人民深厚的战斗的友谊。这就是在十月革命以前，在中俄两国人民都处在黑暗的日子里的中俄两国关系的基本特点。
    伟大的十月革命从一个方面，根本地改变了这种关系。在此以后，俄国的劳动人民上升到了主人的地位，他们获得了自由地和充分地表达对中国人民友好的可能性，获得了通过国家机关来对中国人民实行道义援助和物质援助的可能性。苏联一开国就发表宣言自动废除帝俄时代对中国的一切帝国主义的特权。一九一九年七月苏联政府对中国发表宣言，说：“我们对于东方各民族，尤其对中国人民，力图摆脱帝国主义武力和财力羁绊的运动，极愿予以帮助。我们不仅想救助苏联的劳动阶级，而且想救助中国人民。”苏联经过不断的奋斗，终于在一九二四年和当时中国的北洋军阀政府签订了中俄协定，废除了帝俄在华的各种特权。接着苏联就在思想上、道义上、物质上帮助中国人民的解放运动，促成了一九二五——二七年蓬蓬勃勃的中国第一次大革命。以后，蒋介石叛变了革命，一脚踢开了苏联的友谊，结果招来了日本帝国主义的放肆的侵略。但是就在那时，苏联还坚持对中国人民的友好态度。早在九一八事变后，苏联就警告日本，并且说：“苏联在道义上、精神上、感情上完全同情中国，并愿作一切必要的帮助”。一九三七年，日本帝国主义全面进攻中国，苏联于八月间就和中国订立互不侵犯公约，帮助了我们很多飞机、大炮、航空员，军事专家，还有数亿美元的借款。蒋介石却消极抗战，又把苏联的友谊一脚踢开，发动三次反共高潮，造成抗日战争的极大困难。
    但是，苏联还一贯地坚持着对中国人民的友好态度。一九四五年八月九日，苏联红军于击败了德国法西斯匪军之后三个月，就出兵东北，歼灭日本陆军主力关东军一百万，迫使日本帝国主义宣布无条件投降。八月十四日签订《中苏友好同盟条约》，由中苏两国共同防止日本侵略势力的再起。蒋介石却一心投靠美国帝国主义，又把苏联的友谊一脚踢开，发动了反共反人民的大内战。
    关于苏联对中国人民的这种深厚友谊的真实基础，伟大的斯大林早在一九二五年就作了古典的说明。他说：“中国革命运动的力量是不可计量的，这种力量还没有能使它自己确当地为人感觉出来。但是它一定会在将来使它自己被人感觉出来，看不到这种力量以及不给它以应有的估计的东方和西方的统治者们，将要因此吃大苦头。…这里，真理和正义完全在中国革命的一方面。这就是为什么我们现在和将来都同情中国的革命，同情中国人民自帝国主义的枷锁之下争取解放的斗争，并将中国团结成为整个的国家。”
    这是在十月革命以后在苏联方面的情况，这是中苏关系的一个方面。
    在中国方面呢？十月革命唤醒了中国人，帮助中国人找到了马克思、列宁主义，并组织了自己的解放事业最忠诚的领导者——中国共产党。苏联的帮助和共产党的领导，使中国的劳动人民热烈地爱好社会主义的苏联，并把它看作自己最可靠和最亲密的朋友。在第一次大革命时代，几乎全中国的工农群众和先进知识分子热爱和向往着苏联。在十年内战时期，在革命根据地里的广大农民和国民党统治区城市里的革命工人与革命知识分子衷心地感谢苏联在革命最困难的日子里对自己的同情申援，坚决地反对帝国主义者和蒋介石匪帮的反苏阴谋，并在这样的斗争中在帝国主义者和国民党反动派的屠刀下，付出了多少志士的鲜血和头颅。在抗日战争时期，中国的广大人民，凭着自己的眼睛，耳朵和脑袋，认清了苏联对中国人民的真诚帮助。他们在共产党领导下的抗日民主根据地，得到了充分表达自己的对苏联对斯大林的热爱和感谢。中国人民的这种深厚感情，在毛主席在一九三九年庆祝斯大林六十寿辰大会的讲话中得到了完整的表现。他说：“由于斯大林事业的胜利，他帮助了我们很多的飞机、大炮、航空员、各战区里的军事顾问，还有借款。世界上还有那一个国家这样地帮助我们？世界上还有那一个阶级那一个党那一个人所领导的国家，这样帮助我们呢？除了苏联，除了无产阶级，除了共产党，除了斯大林还有谁呢？”毛主席又说：“苏联这一切友谊，是中国人民所永不会忘记的。”但是在国民党反动派统治的地区，中国人民的这种感情，受着严重的摧折和压制。在那里，帝国主义者和蒋介石反动派对于苏联一切卑鄙无耻的造谣污蔑像毒虫一样，损害着中国人民的善良的心。特别从一九四六年蒋介石匪帮发动了大规模的反革命内战以后，这批美帝国主义的走狗们，这批卖国贼和屠夫们，更加围绕着所谓“张莘夫事件”，所谓“中东路问题”，“旅顺大连问题”，“外蒙古问题”，“新疆问题”等等，制作各种各色卑鄙无耻到了极顶的谣言，来毁谤和污蔑苏联，中伤和挑拨中苏两国人民的感情。而其结果，正如中国古话所说，“自作孽、不可活”，这个卖国贼和杀人凶手的集团，这个恶贯满盈的蒋介石集团，在中国共产党领导的中国人民解放军和中国人民的铁拳下面，已被基本上打倒了。
    中国人民的胜利创造了新的中华人民共和国。在这个国度里，如同在苏联一样，人民作了自己国家的主人。横在中苏两国人民友好合作的道路上的障碍物，已被打扫干净。在新中国成立的第二天苏联政府立即宣布与我们建立外交关系。苏联文化代表团立即来到新中国。苏联专家大批来到北京和各地，热诚地忘我地帮助我们进行经济文化的建设。中苏友好协会成立了，在短短四个月内，友协的会员发展到了二百多万。苏联的专家，以及苏联的电影、图片、戏剧与科学著作，在新中国受到普遍热烈的欢迎。所有这一切，都表现出中苏友好关系在新的情况下面的迅速发展与巩固。在这里，两国人民都以国家主人翁的地位，互相尊敬，互相帮助，互相热爱。在这里，中苏两个伟大国家的伟大人民，可以毫无拘束，毫无顾虑和毫无限制地表达自己对于对方的深厚的兄弟的友谊，并更加发展和巩固这个友谊。现在，中苏两国人民这样的深厚友谊和真诚团结，已经由中苏两国政府签定中苏友好同盟互助条约及其他协定来确定和巩固起来了。这就开辟了中苏友好关系的新时代。
    新时代的中苏友好关系是最光荣的，是至高无上的，是无敌的。
    这首先是因为我们中苏两个伟大国家的伟大人民，都是在共产党的领导之下，是在伟大的斯大林和伟大的毛泽东领导之下，为了自身的解放和全人类的民主和平事业，作了长期的英勇艰苦的奋斗。真理和正义是在我们这一边。我们签定这个中苏友好同盟互助条约和其他协定正像维辛斯基所说：“对于巩固全世界的和平与民主事业，是一个最重大的贡献。”
    其次，是因为中苏友谊的基础是两国人民都是自己国家的主人。正因为如此，所以，这种友谊是真正人民的友谊，是能够充分表达和充分发展的友谊，是真正以两国人民的利益为基础，而不是以一个国家内的少数人的利益为基础的友谊，因而这种友谊能够最完整地与最高度地体现两国人民和全世界人民的美满的希望。
    最后，中苏的伟大友谊本身就代表着一种强大无比的力量。中苏两国是毗连着的世界上幅员最大、物产最富的国家，两国的人口将近七万万，超过全世界人口的三分之一。而这七万万人民，是既勇敢，又勤劳、又智慧的人民，特别是苏联人民是长期地在马列主义的培育下千锤百炼的全世界最先进的人民。中苏两国人民有完全成熟了的布尔塞维克的共产党的领导，他们有如此卓越和伟大的斯大林和毛泽东作为自己的英明领袖和导师，他们又有无敌的和深刻了解自己的光荣使命的苏军和中国人民解放军作为自己的完全称职的卫士。这样两个伟大国家和伟大人民现在结成了友好同盟了。中苏友好同盟互助条约具体地规定了：“缔约国双方保证共同尽力采取一切必要的措施，以期制止日本或其他直接间接在侵略行为上与日本相勾结的任何国家之重新侵略与破坏和平。一旦缔约国任何一方受到日本或与日本同盟的国家之侵袭因而处于战争状态时，缔约国另一方即尽其全力给予军事及其他援助。”同时规定了：“缔约国双方根据巩固和平与普遍安全的利益，对有关中苏两国共同利益的一切重大国际问题，均将进行彼此协商。”这是何等的团结一致！这是何等的崇高！这是何等的有力量！
    让帝国主义者及其一切走狗们，在我们无敌的兄弟同盟面前发抖吧！美帝国主义者最近特别努力于执行它的破坏中苏友谊的重大战略方针。现在他显然已在全世界人民面前打了个大败仗。而我们中国人民、苏联人民、和全世界人民也就在这里为着世界的巩固和平打了个大胜仗。世界民主和平阵营经过中苏友好同盟互助条约的签定，是更加强大了。全世界一切民主和平的战士们将从这里得到了一种新的保证和力量，以便在战略上更加渺视那些外强中干的帝国主义者，并从而谨慎地和勇敢地打倒他们。  一九五○、二、一五北京。
