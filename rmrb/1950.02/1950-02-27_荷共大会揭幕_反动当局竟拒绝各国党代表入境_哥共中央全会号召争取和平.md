Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 26th: According to TASS, The Hague: The Dutch Communist Party Congress is scheduled to open in Rotterdam on the 25th. The Dutch authorities have decided to disallow any delegation from fraternal parties that were invited to attend from entering the Netherlands, a measure that has aroused widespread public indignation. The Lawyers Association sent a telegram to the Minister of Justice, strongly protesting the government's refusal to issue entry visas to foreign delegations invited to attend the Communist Party Congress. At the same time, the democratic newspapers expressed anger at the Dutch government for issuing entry visas to German fascist Heinkel to serve as a consultant at the Fokker aircraft factory in the Netherlands, while refusing entry visas to fighters for peace.
    Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 26th: According to the Electric News Agency, Havana, 21st: The Central Committee of the Colombian Communist Party in South America recently held its 13th Plenary Session in Bogotá, the capital of the country. The Central Plenary Session completely reaffirmed the political line stipulated by the Sixth National Congress and emphasized that the party's main tasks at present are to strive for peace and oppose war, and to organize a huge and broad movement to resist dictatorship. The plenary session analyzed and praised the work carried out by the party during the current period of bloody suppression, and declared that the party's work can become the basis for more extensive revolutionary actions.
    All local organizers expressed great optimism about the party's prospects for the near future. They said that the Communist Party of Colombia, despite the brutal persecution by the Pérez dictatorship, is still surviving and growing.
    The 13th Central Plenary Session was attended by Communist Party leaders from all over the country, including oil workers, land reclamation workers, and sailors, as well as important local organizers who were not members of the Central Committee. The plenary session was held in complete illegality and was completely victorious in outwitting the vigilant police. All participants returned safely to their places after the meeting.
