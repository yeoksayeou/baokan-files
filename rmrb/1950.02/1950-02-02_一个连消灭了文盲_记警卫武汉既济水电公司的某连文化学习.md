A Company Eliminates Illiteracy
A Record of the Cultural Studies of a Certain Company Guarding the Wuhan Jiji Hydroelectric Company

Before launching the cultural movement, the Seventh Company of a certain unit, responsible for guarding the water plant of the Jiji Hydroelectric Company, had over forty members who were either illiterate or knew less than one hundred characters. After two and a half months of study, illiteracy has been eliminated. Four people can recognize more than 120 characters, and generally, everyone can recognize between 200 and 400 characters (accounting for more than two-thirds of the company). The best among them can already recognize around 600 to 700 characters and can write simple letters home or receipts.

The main reason for these achievements is that every member of the company has established the correct understanding that "without culture, one cannot learn to use modern weapons and will not be able to undertake the task of guarding national defense in the future." As soldier Mo Chunfang said: "The national liberation war is coming to an end soon. In the future, if we serve in the national defense forces using modern weapons, it will be very difficult if we are illiterate." Xu Changjiu also said, "Because of illiteracy, I have suffered many losses in my work, especially when working in a new place, I am like a blind man, stumbling around everywhere." In order to take on the glorious mission of the future and to adapt to the needs of current practical work, they have demonstrated a high degree of initiative and fiery enthusiasm in their studies. Yang Wenju, the deputy platoon leader of the second platoon, in addition to study time, also found the cultural instructor to connect the learned characters one by one into sentences and record them in his notebook. After the New Year, he personally participated in the studies. Han Shengxian, the platoon leader of the third platoon, competed with the deputy platoon leader and soldiers in their studies. He often got together with the deputy platoon leader and soldiers whenever he had time to quiz each other, which motivated all the soldiers in the platoon to participate in the studies. During the studies, the entire company made more than 30 literacy cards. Literacy cards were hung in the kitchen, next to the sentry posts, and in the recreation areas—wherever they often frequented. After each class, the cultural instructor would write on the cards and distribute them to various places. They stipulated that when sentries handed over their posts, they not only had to explain the situation but also had to be able to read the words on the literacy cards. If they could not read them when asking for leave to go out at the gate, they were not allowed to leave. Comrades usually borrowed things and implemented a borrowing note movement, requiring a written borrowing note before anything could be borrowed. A test was held once a week, and those who passed were rewarded with materials (study notebooks). If a certain unit was found to be studying well, it was promptly broadcast to another unit via quick reports and loudspeakers. There were mutual aid groups in the studies, with those who knew teaching those who didn’t, and those who recognized more teaching those who recognized less.

Currently, some soldiers have realized the benefits of learning culture. For example, soldier Chen Lansheng was not active enough when he started studying. One day, he went to the city to buy grain, and it just so happened that the characters on the sign at the entrance of that shop were all ones he had just learned. This made him realize that in the past, he was completely in the dark when he saw any characters, but now he could understand the prices on the sign. This realization made him determined to study hard after returning, and now he has learned nearly 600 new characters. Fu Chengfa initially only recognized more than 50 characters. Now he has written three simple letters home, each time giving the original draft to the cultural instructor for revision and then copying it again, keeping the original draft for further study. In his studies, soldier Su Qingyun sorted the homophones together and the unrecognized characters together, writing them in another notebook so that he could ask others about them at any time. During the test a few days ago, he had learned nearly 800 new characters. In addition to learning the characters taught by the cultural instructor, Wang Xuede spent his own money to buy a copy of the Hundred Family Surnames and wrote down the names of all the comrades in the company. Cai Jiesheng did not even recognize his own surname when he started studying, but he has never missed a class since the first day. Now he recognizes more than 360 new characters. Because of his work, communicator Wang Fuxiang often could not attend classes on time, so he wrote down the new characters he often encountered in his work. After others told him how to read them, he wrote a homophone below for memory. For example, for the "武" (Wu) in Wuhan, he wrote the Arabic numeral "5" below it. After doing this several times, he memorized it. When studying, Xu Changjiu often practiced on the ground or in a sandbox how each stroke of a character should be placed, where one stroke touched and where it extended, before writing it in his notebook. Sometimes, he broke down a character that could be divided into several characters to recognize them, and then put them back together. For example, the character "要" (yao) in "to strengthen cultural learning" can be broken down into the characters "西" (xi) and "女" (nv), and put together it is the character "要" (yao), so in one go, he could learn three characters.

In addition, the cadres' personal participation in studying with the soldiers and the many mutual assistance methods they came up with in their studies were also one of the reasons for the achievements. For example, each platoon leader (company-level cadres participate in the group's theoretical study). Whenever he received letters from home, he always asked others to read them for him. Now he can recognize most of the letters from home. He has learned more than 700 characters and has begun to learn to write drafts for quick reports. All of this has greatly increased the soldiers' confidence in learning and encouraged them to move more courageously towards the road of learning!

　　一个连消灭了文盲
    记警卫武汉既济水电公司的某连文化学习
    在既济水电公司水厂担任警卫工作的某部七连在开展文化运动以前，全连不识字的（文盲）和认不到一百字的共有四十多人，经两月半的学习后，已扫除了文盲。认得一百二十多字的有四人，一般都能认得二百至四百字（占全连人数三分之二以上），其中最好的一部分已经认得六百至七百字左右，且能写出简单的家信或收借条子。
    获得这些成绩的原因，主要是由于该连的每个成员，都树立了“没有文化就不能学会使用近代武器，将来担任不起警卫国防的任务”的正确认识。如战士莫春芳说：“全国解放战争很快就要结束，将来担任国防军使用近代化武器，不识字就会有很多困难。”徐长久也说：“因为不识字在工作中不知道吃了多少亏，特别是到一个新地方工作，就像睁眼瞎子一样，到处乱碰。”为了担起未来的光荣任务，与适应目前实际工作中的需要，他们便在学习中发挥了高度的主动性，和火一般的热情。二排副排长杨文举每天在学习时间以外，并找到文化教员把学会的字逐个逐个连成句子记到本子上，新年以后，他已亲自参加学习。第三排排长韩盛先，在学习中与排副、战士竞赛，经常一有时间就与排副、战士碰在一起你考我，我考你，以致把全排的战士都带动参加了学习。在学习中，全连作了三十多块识字牌，厨房里、岗哨旁边、游艺场上，凡是他们经常活动的地方都挂有识字牌，每到上完课以后由文化教员再写到牌子上分送到各处；他们自己订出岗哨交班时不只交待情况，同时要把识字牌上的字读得下才行。请假外出，走到门岗时如果读不出即不许出去；同志们平时借东西用，实行打借条运动，一定写了借条才能借；一星期举行一次测验，及格的予以物质（学习本子）奖励，发现某一单位学得好的，就及时运用快报、喇叭筒向另一单位广播。学习中有互助小组，会的教不会的，认得多的教认得少的。
    目前，有些战士已体会到了学习文化的好处。如战士陈兰盛在开始学习时不够积极，有一天到市内来买粮食，刚巧那商号门口牌子上几个字全都是他才学会的，使他想到以前看到什么字都是两眼漆黑，现在能看懂牌上的价目，这个收获使他回去后就下了决心努力学习，现在他已学会近六百个生字。傅成法开始时只认得五十多个字，现在已写出了三封简单的家信，每次均把原稿交给文化教员修改，然后再抄一遍，把原稿留下来再细细的学习。战士苏庆云在学习中把同音的字挑在一起，把认不得的字挑在一起，写在另一个本子上，以便随时询问别人，前几天测验时，他学到的生字已近八百左右。王学德除掉把文化教员教的字学会外，在课外又自己出钱买了一本百家姓，将全连同志的姓名写下来。蔡界盛在开始学习时连自己的姓都认不得，但从第一天起一直没旷过课，现在他已认得三百六十多个生字了。通讯员王福祥由于他的工作常常使他不能按时听课，就把在工作中常常遇到的生字记下来，别人告诉了他的读法后，他就在下面记上一个同音字以便记忆。如武汉市的“武”字下边就注上一个阿拉伯字的“５”，这样几次以后就记熟了。徐长久在学习时，常常把一个字中的那一个笔划应该放在什么地方，那一笔顶到那里又伸到那里，先在地皮上，沙盘上练熟了再写到本子上，有时又把一个能拆成几个字的字拆开来认，再合起来。如要加强学习文化的“要”字拆开来成为一个“西”字一个“女”字，合起来就是个“要”字，这样一次就可以学到三个字。
    此外，干部亲自参加到战士一起学习，并在学习中想出了很多互相帮助学习的办法，也是获得成绩的原因之一，如各排排长（连级干部参加团的理论学习。）每次家里给他寄来的信总是找别人看，现在家里来的信已经大部分能认得，他已经学到七百多字，并且开始学习写快报上的搞子了。这些都使战士们的学习信心倍增，更勇敢地向学习大路上迈进！
