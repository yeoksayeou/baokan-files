　　Actively Contacting All Parties to Open Up Sales Channels
    Beijing Department Store's Sales Surge
     January Sales Totaled Over 10 Billion
    [Our Newspaper's Report] The Beijing Branch of the North China Department Store Company has proactively expanded its business, achieving sales of 10.19 billion yuan in January. This is almost double the 5.6 billion yuan recorded in December of last year. In January, in addition to consolidating and expanding retail business and adding goods to the stores, the company paid special attention to directly handling larger supplies to various government agencies, organizations, schools, and cooperatives. A total of 223 entities made bulk purchases. The Municipal Construction Bureau, Qingguan Bureau, and Xinhua Printing Factory alone purchased 80,000 bags of cement. In terms of urban-rural material exchange, on the one hand, the company directly concluded transactions with other cities, first selling 6,600 bags of cement to the Zhangjiakou Construction Bureau, 600 bags of cement and 200 boxes of glass to the Pingyuan Provincial Government; and exchanged 1,040 rolls of web paper for 400 cases of cigarettes from the Baoding Yuanfeng Cigarette Factory in Hebei Province. On the other hand, it sold to the countryside through traveling merchants and peddlers. Within January, 576,883 catties of sugar, 3,139 packages of alkali noodles, 1,101 bundles of matches, and over 3,000 bolts of fancy cloth were sold. Most of these were transported and sold to the Northwest by traveling merchants and peddlers. In terms of consignment (i.e., agency sales) business, the company also added 16 consignment factories in January, mostly retail. The main reason for the company's business development is that it summarized last year's work and further clarified its operating principles. Under the principle of small profits and quick turnover, it directly handled low-priced wholesale to various government agencies, organizations, schools, and cooperatives. Several cadres were sent out every day to various agencies to contact businesses, solicit opinions, and improve work in a timely manner. It also held a forum for 48 goods-using departments to specifically solicit opinions on improving business. This has greatly helped the development of the business. The company believes that this is the mass line that state-owned trade should follow. Secondly, it prepared holiday goods in advance, grasped the seasonality of commodities, enriched its inventory, and was able to supply them in a timely manner.

　　主动与各方联系开辟销路
    京百货公司销货激增
     一月份售货总值达百余亿
    【本报讯】华北百货公司北京分公司主动开展业务，一月份销货一○一·九亿元。较去年十二月份之五十六亿元几乎增加一倍。一月份该公司除巩固与扩大零售业务，增添门市货品外，特别注意了直接向各机关、团体、学校、合作社办理较大的供给。先后大宗购货者计有二二三个单位。仅本市建设局、清管局、新华印刷厂等单位即购去洋灰八万袋。在城乡物资交流上，一方面直接与外埠成交，先售给张垣建设局洋灰六千六百袋，平原省政府洋灰六百袋、玻璃二百箱；又用盘纸一○四○盘，交换河北省保定源丰烟厂纸烟四百箱。另一方面，是通过行商小贩向四乡销售。一月内销出糖五七六、八八三斤，碱面三、一三九包，火柴一、一○一筒，花色布三、○○○余匹。其中大部系由行商小贩运往西北销售。经销（即代售）业务方面，一月份亦增加经销工厂十六户。大部系零售。该公司业务开展的主要原因，是总结了去年的工作，进一步明确了经营方针。在薄利多销的原则下，直接向各机关、团体、学校、合作社办理廉价的批发。每日派出若干干部分赴各机关联系业务，征求意见，及时改进工作。并曾召开四十八个用货部门的座谈会，专门征求改进业务的意见。这对业务的开展帮助很大。该公司认为这是国营贸易应走的群众路线。其次，是事前即将年节货品备妥，掌握了商品的季节性，使库存物资丰富，能及时供应。
