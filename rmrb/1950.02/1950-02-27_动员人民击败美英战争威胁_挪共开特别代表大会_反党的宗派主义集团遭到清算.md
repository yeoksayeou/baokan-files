　　Mobilizing the People to Defeat the US-British War Threat
    Norwegian Communist Party Holds Special Congress
    Anti-Party Sectarian Group Purged
    [Xinhua News Agency, Oslo, February 26th] TASS, Oslo dispatch: The special congress of the Norwegian Communist Party, which opened a few days ago, concluded victoriously on the 22nd. The congress successfully purged the anti-Party sectarian group within the Norwegian Communist Party. More than 300 delegates attended the congress, as well as representatives from fraternal parties in Denmark, the Netherlands, Spain, Romania, Germany, Poland, Sweden, and France. Telegrams of congratulations to the Norwegian Communist Party delegates from the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, the Communist Parties of Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, and Great Britain, and the Hungarian Workers' Party were read out at the meeting. Subsequently, the Chairman of the Norwegian Communist Party, Løvlien, made a report on the first item on the agenda, "Striving for Party Unity, Striving for a Correct General Direction and Practice." In his report, he pointed out that this special congress was the inevitable result of the political failure of the sectarian group within the Party. The Party had already politically defeated the Furubotn group, which had led the Party's work in an incorrect direction. The Party's task was to mobilize the people to defeat the aggressive North Atlantic Treaty and the threat of war. He said that the recently signed treaty of friendship and alliance between the People's Republic of China and the Soviet Union was another huge blow to the warmongers.
    On the 22nd, Peteresen, a member of the Central Committee of the Norwegian Communist Party, made a report on the second item on the agenda, regarding the Party's urgent tasks. He strongly condemned the Norwegian government's domestic and foreign policies and called on the entire Party to further struggle for peace, democracy, freedom, national independence, and socialism.
    Finally, the congress unanimously adopted a political resolution and a resolution on the Party's internal situation. The political resolution pointed out that the Party's urgent tasks were to defend peace and national independence; to fight for a higher standard of living for the Norwegian working class and working people; to strengthen unity and build a strong Communist Party. The resolution on the Party's internal situation fiercely denounced the anti-Party activities of the Furubotn group. Twenty-two of the group's most active supporters have been expelled from the Party, including Furubotn, Halvorsen, Vettri, Berg, and others.
    The congress unanimously elected Løvlien, Peteresen, and twelve others to form the Party's new Central Committee. Løvlien was re-elected as the Chairman of the Party, receiving enthusiastic applause from the congress.
    Note: Furubotn took the opportunity to infiltrate the Central Committee of the Norwegian Communist Party in 1941, when the leaders of the Norwegian Communist Party were imprisoned by the fascists. Shortly thereafter, he took over as Secretary-General. During the war and after the war, Furubotn acted arbitrarily, implementing an anti-Marxist line, replacing the proletariat's class struggle with bourgeois nationalism, and creating a series of counter-revolutionary "theories." After being removed from the post of Secretary-General in October 1947, he not only failed to correct his political mistakes but consciously organized an anti-Party sectarian group, promoting Titoism and anti-Party ideas. Last October, the Norwegian Communist Party decided to expel him from the Party.

　　动员人民击败美英战争威胁
    挪共开特别代表大会
    反党的宗派主义集团遭到清算
    【新华社北京二十六日电】塔斯社奥斯陆消息：挪威共产党日前举行的特别代表大会，已于二十二日闭幕。大会胜利地清算了挪威共产党内的反党的宗派主义集团。出席这次大会的有三百多名代表及丹麦、荷兰、西班牙、罗马尼亚、德国、波兰、瑞典和法国等各兄弟党的代表。会上宣读了苏联共产党中央委员会，保、捷、英共产党及匈牙利工人党致挪威共产党代表的贺电。继之，挪共主席洛夫林作了关于第一项议程“争取党的团结，争取正确的总方针与实践”的报告。他在报告中指出，这次特别大会是党内宗派主义集团政治失败的必然结果，党已经在政治上彻底击败了曾把党的工作引上不正确方向的福鲁波顿集团，党的任务是动员人民击败侵略性北大西洋公约及战争威胁。他说，中华人民共和国与苏联新近签订的友好同盟的条约，给了战争贩子又一巨大的打击。
    二十二日，挪威共产党中央委员会委员彼德森就议程第二项关于党的迫切任务作了报告。他强烈地谴责了挪威政府的内政外交政策，号召全党更进一步为和平、民主、自由、国家独立和社会主义而斗争。
    最后，大会一致通过政治决议及关于党内形势的决议。政治决议指出党的迫切任务是：保卫和平与国家的独立；为挪威工人阶级及劳苦人民争取较高的生活水准而斗争；巩固团结及建立强大的共产党。党内形势的决议猛烈地斥责福鲁波顿集团的反党活动，该集团的二十二名最积极的拥护者已被开除党籍，其中包括：福鲁波顿、哈尔沃森、维特里森、贝格及其他人等。
    大会一致选出了洛夫林，彼得森等十二人组成党的新中央委员会。洛夫林再次当选为党的主席，受到大会热烈的欢呼。
    按：福鲁波顿于一九四一年在挪共领袖们被法西斯投入狱中时，乘机混入挪共中央委员会，并于不久以后，担任总书记职务。福鲁波顿在战时与战后期间，一意孤行，执行反马克思主义的路线，以资产阶级的民族主义来代替无产阶级的阶级斗争，并制造一系列的反革命的“理论”。他在一九四七年十月被解除总书记职务后，不仅未纠正自己的政治错误，反而有意识地组织反党的宗派主义集团，宣传铁托主义和反党的思想。去年十月，挪威共产党决定把他开除出党。
