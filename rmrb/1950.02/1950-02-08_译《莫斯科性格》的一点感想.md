Some Thoughts on Translating "Moscow Character"
    Wang Jinling
    "Moscow Character" is a good play. When I was translating it, I simply couldn't put it down. The impressions of characters like Podobédov, Gorlinina, and Tsarev gradually became clear in my mind. Every time I translated a sentence, it felt as if they were vividly speaking that sentence in front of me.

    Gorlinina said to Podobédov, "I feel that you are slowly losing your sense of new things" and "gradually becoming a narrow-minded pragmatist." I think this sense of new things is a quality that all progressive people, revolutionary people, must possess. People who lose their sense of new things cannot progress.

    New things, in their early stages, are always in a nascent state, not easily seen by people, and therefore often overlooked, even ruined. Gorlinina said to Krivosheyev, "It is difficult for children to be born, but they still grow up." "Still grow up!" What firm confidence this expresses in the growth of new things! Indeed, everything old, no matter how powerful it is today, is always heading towards death, and everything new, no matter how young it is today, is always heading towards growth. Therefore, those who lose their sense of new things will ultimately run into snags and fail.

    To have a sense of new things, one must abandon some outdated and backward ideas and experiences. Just as Gorlinina said to Podobédov, "The emergence of anything new will always hinder something." Progress and backwardness, the new and the old, are irreconcilable; one must choose between the two.

    Losing a sense of new things is the most essential characteristic of empiricism. This ideological empiricism is often combined with organizational departmentalism. Podobédov not only lost his sense of new things, but precisely because he lost his sense of new things, he committed the error of departmentalism. He only saw his own achievements and was unwilling to help others. Instead, he satirized others for their work lagging behind due to the war.

    The Moscow character is tenacious, but not stubborn, not headstrong, but courageous in "upholding the truth and correcting mistakes." The tenacity of character and the firm belief in the pursuit of truth cannot be separated. Here, "criticism and self-criticism" play a decisive role.

    "Moscow Character" shows the new people, new character, and new relationships of socialist society, praising all these new and progressive things, while also appropriately criticizing some old and backward things in the overall movement of progress. This is a play worth learning from.

　　译《莫斯科性格》的一点感想
    王金陵
    《莫斯科性格》是一个好戏。在我翻译它的时候，简直放不下手。波达波夫、葛利尼娃、蔡崔夫等这些人物的印象，一个个的在我脑子里由模糊而变成明显。每翻译一句话的时候，真好像他们在我面前活生生地讲着那句话。
    葛利尼娃对波达波夫说：“我感觉到你是慢慢的失掉了你对新鲜事物的感觉”，而“渐渐的变成一个思想狭隘的事务家”。我觉得这种对于新鲜事物的感觉，是一切前进的人们，革命的人们必须具备的品质。失去了对新鲜事物的感觉的人，就不能进步了。
    新生的事物，开始的时候，总是萌芽状态，不容易被人们看得出来，因此常常被人们忽视着，甚至糟蹋着。葛利尼夫对克利伏胜说：“小孩子出世都是困难的，但是他们还是长大了。”“还是长大了！”这对新事物的成长，充满了何等坚定的信心！的确，一切旧的，那怕它今天还强大，总是走向死亡的，一切新的，那怕它今天还幼小，总是走向壮大的。因此那些失去了对新鲜事物感觉的人们最后总是要碰钉子，要失败的。
    要有新鲜事物感觉，就要抛弃一些陈腐落后的思想和经验。也正如葛利尼娃对波达波夫所说的：“任何一件新东西的产生总是会妨碍一些东西的。”前进和落后，新和旧是不两立的，二者必取其一。
    对新鲜事物失去感觉，这就是经验主义的最本质的特点。这种思想上的经验主义，就往往和组织上的本位主义结合起来。波达波夫不但失去了对新鲜事物的感觉，而且正因为他失去对新鲜事物的感觉，他犯了本位主义的错误。他只看见自己的成绩，而不愿帮助别人，他反而讽刺别人因战争的关系而落后一步的工作。
    莫斯科性格是顽强的，但不是顽固，不是刚愎自用，而是勇于“坚持真理，修正错误”，性格的顽强和追求真理的坚定信念是不能分开的，在这里“批评与自我批评”就起着决定的作用。
    《莫斯科性格》表现了社会主义社会的新人物，新性格，新关系，歌颂了这一切新的、前进的东西，同时也恰当的批评了在整个前进运动中部分旧的，落后的东西。这是值得我们好好学习的一个戏。
