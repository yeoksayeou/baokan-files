　　The U.S. State Department at the End of Its Rope
    By Saiji Yewa, Translated by Chen Di

    Two things happened almost simultaneously. One was the creation of a "psychological warfare system" by the U.S. State Department to strengthen its intelligence and propaganda activities in other countries. The other was the organization of a friendship association with Tito's Yugoslavia by some British members of Parliament. At first glance, these two events seem unrelated, but in fact, their occurrence is closely linked.

    To understand the connection between them, we must look back at the facts of a few weeks ago. We can mention the meeting of American diplomatic intelligence chiefs in Europe convened by the State Department. American diplomats stationed in Western European countries, along with Harriman and McCloy, met in Paris; American diplomatic representatives stationed in the Soviet Union and people's democracies, along with Kennan, former Washington ambassador to Belgrade, and Allen, Assistant Secretary of State who has been designated to replace Kennan, met in London. The convening of these two meetings was directly due to Washington's failure in its foreign policy around the world, especially the exposure of American diplomatic intelligence activities in Eastern European countries.

    By the autumn of 1949, the State Department's policy was clearly falling apart. Dulles' new Balkan plan, comparable to Churchill's, had proven to be a failure, and Tito's high-ranking secret agents were exposed in broad daylight. The conspiracy to create a new fascist West German regime did not produce the expected results either. If we remember the victory of the Chinese people's democracy and the establishment of the German Democratic Republic, such unprecedented developments, and the collapse of the American atomic blackmail, it is not difficult to understand why Washington commentators, led by Lippmann, suddenly began to talk about the need for "revision" of the State Department's policy. But this "revision" began and ended simultaneously with the activities of the diplomatic intelligence service.

    Of the two meetings of American diplomats, the one held in London on October 24 and 25 is particularly noteworthy because it discussed the failure of direct sabotage plans against the Soviet Union and people's democracies. This was a particularly important issue discussed at the meeting because it directly related to Washington's major strategic errors on the main front against democracy and peace.

    The London meeting was conducted in extreme secrecy, but information leaked from the press allows people to know some of what was discussed at the meeting. Judging from reports by Reuters and the Associated Press, there were two main issues on the agenda: how to exploit the Belgrade gang, now that it has been exposed; and the failure of American conspiracies in Eastern European countries, and the possible steps to be taken in the future in connection with this.

    It is no secret that American diplomats in people's democracies are not there to promote friendship between the United States and these countries, but to undermine the existing governments of Eastern European countries. Dulles' "Action X" does not hide its despicable diplomatic tactics of "hiding a knife in the sleeve": conspiring to subvert national power, secret assassinations, and sabotage. The purpose of American policy in Eastern European countries is to destroy democratic regimes in order to restore the power of landlords and capitalists, and to turn these countries into American bridgeheads. It is not surprising that this policy has proven to be a failure and has encountered the firm resistance of the people.

    The report prepared by the U.S. State Department for the London meeting (the original can also be seen in the newspapers) attempted to analyze the reasons for the failure of American diplomats in people's democracies, but it only discussed the technical aspects and did not delve into the essence of the problem.

    Leaked information says that the strategic line of American foreign policy towards people's democracies is based on erroneous judgments about the internal situation of these countries, especially the erroneous judgment of the balance of power between democratic and reactionary forces. The State Department received incorrect information from its ambassadors. We can learn from those who are in close contact with the American and British "diplomatic kitchens" how the so-called "reliable intelligence" about the Soviet Union and people's democracies is fabricated. They are completely drawn from a mire of fabrication and slander, and their authors try as much as possible to please the State Department masters, and describe the situation to suit their tastes.

    Washington's foreign policy is determined by those who blindly hate the Soviet Union and people's democratic regimes. This group of people underestimates the power of the working class and ignores the increasing awareness of the masses, especially the people's desire for peace and their deep hatred of warmongering propaganda. The State Department decided on its tactics, willingly believing that the people's democratic regimes were weak and incompetent, and overestimated the reactionary forces.

    The successful economic construction of the people's democracies, the stability of their regimes and the great and continuous increase of the prestige of the Communist Party - these kinds of facts are all unpleasant and unexpected things for Washington.

    According to newspaper reports, the following interesting things were revealed at the London meeting. When Washington began to doubt the information received from people's democracies, it sent special agents to Europe to observe May Day parades, Youth Day, mass celebrations, International Peace Day parades, etc. Those observers traveled under the guise of merchants, professors, students, and reporters, and as a result, they reported their impressions to Washington, making the State Department realize that not only had its detective intelligence activities completely failed, but also its ideological war was a complete defeat.

    We know that American propaganda carries this stupid idea that "communism will collapse internally" and that the whole world is eager to adopt the American way of life and Wall Street's ideas. At the London meeting, State Department representatives were forced to admit that these ideas could only deceive public opinion, and that, in reality, if anything was collapsing in people's democracies, it was primarily American propaganda.

    According to newspaper reports on the London meeting, the U.S. State Department was very angry with its diplomats because they created the wrong impression that the "Voice of America" broadcast was making the European people believe in the doctrines of Wall Street, and because they concealed some facts, such as the fact that people did not listen to its broadcasts seriously, and that the things it broadcast were so obviously distorted that they only aroused the anger and ridicule of the listeners. This proves that it is completely useless to spend millions of dollars to poison the opinions of the people of people's democracies and to mislead them in order to promote the destructive plans of American imperialism.

    The State Department convened these two meetings of diplomats at the same time, not only to review its failures, but also to formulate future courses of action. Its idea is to strengthen detective and intelligence activities in Europe on the one hand, and to strengthen American propaganda on the other. For this purpose, the State Department created the "psychological warfare system," officially called the "Departmental Diplomatic Intelligence Department," which will be composed of representatives from the Department of Defense, the Marshall Plan Administration, and other agencies engaged in espionage and intelligence work and spreading American propaganda. These departments will work together to try to improve the shortcomings in its activities that the State Department has discovered.

    "Psychological warfare" is only one component of the "Cold War" waged by American imperialists against the democratic camp. Monopoly newspapers openly declare that the strategy of the Cold War in the future was meticulously formulated at the London meeting. This means that it is preparing new anti-Soviet plans and new ugly secret conspiracies against the Soviet Union, against people's democracies, and against peace. It is difficult to say now how the United States will improve its "psychological warfare system" in order to carry out sabotage activities in Europe. At present, it is old wine in new bottles. An example is that the Cold War strategy has been revised, paying special attention to exploiting the Tito gang.

    The exposure of Tito's gang, Wall Street's agent, is a fatal blow to the entire conspiracy system of the imperialists in Eastern Europe. The State Department and American intelligence chiefs are racking their brains to figure out how to exploit the Tito gang in order to achieve their destructive goals, because the Tito gang can no longer be used as a secret agent. Belgrade must now be classified as an open dependency of American imperialism. At the Fourth United Nations General Assembly, Tito's officials appeared completely as despicable agents and lackeys of American imperialism.

    American and British newspapers, in discussing the London meeting, did not hide the fact that the U.S. State Department was very busy discussing how to "aid" Tito and continue to exploit the Tito elements in the future. People can see what steps have now been taken in this regard. The first is to establish reactionary propaganda agencies to help Tito. Its job is to cover up the true nature of the Tito fascist group, assassins hired by imperialism. In order to further deceive the masses, right-wing "socialist" elements were also ordered to take action. Then American secret service agencies directly gave those "socialists" specific missions to travel to Yugoslavia. Visitors came from various countries, especially from Britain and Italy. Newspapers are full of their impressions and travelogues. They disguise the fascist group established by Tito, the agent of American and British imperialism, as "socialist."

    We might as well evaluate from this perspective the special organization supporting Tito's followers established in London - the British-Yugoslav Friendship Association. It was initiated by some members of Parliament, including Stanley Tiffany (Chairman), Lee Manning (Vice Chairman), Ciriacus, John Pike Norman Dutt, and David Raymond, foreign editor of Reynolds News. This group is used to destroy the progressive British-Yugoslav Association, because the latter has denounced the despicable behavior of the Tito gang. The new organization has announced that it will hold gatherings, lectures, films, and publish journals and pamphlets "to introduce all aspects of Yugoslavia today, including political, economic, social and cultural achievements and plans."

    What are the so-called achievements? The Tito gang, which seized power and engaged in espionage, has established a fascist police government in Yugoslavia. The whole country has become a military concentration camp; the democratic rights of workers have been deprived, and freedom of thought is impossible. Economically, Yugoslavia has been under the control of foreign monopoly capital and is becoming an agricultural and raw material appendage of British and American capital. The poverty of the workers is extremely serious. These are the political and economic "achievements" under the control of the gang of spies and assassins who seized power in Yugoslavia. Social "achievements" mean the cruel and barbaric exploitation of the working people. And their cultural "achievements" are to turn the country into a huge "Gestapo" (secret police) hell. These "achievements" are what the Labor Party admirers are now promoting.

    People will not fail to see that this new group organized in London by Tito's partners includes so-called "left-leaning" and "independent" Labor Party members, of course including Ciriacus. The exposure of the Tito elements also exposed the masks of those "left-leaning" people, who are now openly colluding with the imperialist detectives and saboteurs.

    The special propaganda agency established in London to praise the Belgrade fascist gang shows that the imperialists ignore the failure and exposure of the Tito gang, and they still want to rely on its help in order to continue their espionage and sabotage activities against the democratic camp.

    The same thing happened after Trotskyism was exposed. The crushing of these conspiracy plans is also due to the old problem: underestimating the spiritual and political strength of the democratic and socialist camp. Relying on the exposed and notorious Belgrade adventurers is, as the British saying goes, like flogging a dead horse. Tito and his patrons will be spurned and become the dregs of history, like the fate of Trotsky elements, the agents of imperialism.

    The Tito agency is only one item in the arsenal of Washington's foreign policy, but it is a typical one. As they frantically seek tools and methods for conducting "Cold War," "psychological warfare," and other similar wars (these wars are a component of preparing for a real massacre war), the Washington warmongers are playing their old tune, they have neither new ideas nor new political power. The remnants of fragmented and discredited reactionary parties and classes, even yesterday's Hitlerites, the Catholic reactionaries headed by the Vatican, and the right-wing "socialists" who have assimilated with the new fascists - all these are "dead horses," and they can't do anything for them.

    The reactionary Washington decision-makers are not eager to find any reasonable conclusions for their failures. They have not indicated that they will adopt a more realistic policy, abandon their anti-Soviet and anti-people's democratic conspiracies and tricks, and proceed from the possibility of coexistence of two systems, honestly and earnestly cooperate with these countries.

    There is no doubt that if Washington's wise guys continue their Cold War policy, continue to whip their "dead horses," and stubbornly adhere to the strategy of "hiding a knife in the sleeve," then greater failures await them, and they will end up in a dishonorable and shameful ending. The recent exposure of American and British espionage activities in Bulgaria can prove this. The recent indictment issued by the Bulgarian Supreme Prosecutor against Kostov's treason case is a serious blow to Washington's policy.

　　美国务院穷途末路
    塞吉叶瓦  著  陈涤  译
    两桩事情几乎是同时出现的。一桩是美国国务院为了加强其在别的国家中的情报与宣传活动而创设了“心理战体制”。另一桩就是某些英国国会议员组织了一个对铁托南斯拉夫的友谊协会。初看起来，这二件事之间似乎是一无关联的，但事实上它们的发生却密切地联系着。
    要明了这之间的联系，我们必须回顾发生在几星期以前的事实。我们可以提及由国务院召集在欧洲的美国外交情报头目的会议。美国驻西欧国家的外交人员，加上哈里曼与麦克洛埃二人，在巴黎会晤；美国驻苏联与人民民主国家的外交代表，加上华盛顿前驻贝尔格莱特大使凯南，与已经指定来代替凯南职务的国务院助理国务卿艾伦，在伦敦会晤。召集这两个会议，是完全直接由于华盛顿在全世界遭受到外交政策的失败，特别是由于美国在东欧国家中外交情报活动的被暴露。
    一九四九年秋天，国务院的政策是已很清楚地支离破碎了。媲美邱吉尔的杜勒斯新巴尔干计划已证明是失败的了，铁托高级密探们被暴露于光天化日之下。制造新法西斯西德政权的阴谋，也并没有产生预期的结果。如果我们记住了中国人民民主的胜利与德意志民主共和国的成立，那样空前巨大的发展与美国原子讹诈的崩溃，我们就不难明白为什么由李普曼所领导的华盛顿评论家，忽然开始谈论国务院的政策有“修正”之需要了。但是“修正”却与外交情报服务的活动是同时开始并同时结束的。
    在那二个美国外交人员的会议中，十月二十四日与二十五日在伦敦召开的特别值得注意，因为它讨论到直接破坏苏联与人民民主国家计划的失败。这是会议上所讨论的特别重要问题，因为它直接关联着华盛顿在反民主和平的主要战线上的重大战略错误。
    伦敦会议是在极端秘密之下进行的，但是，从报端透露出来的消息，使人们可以知道会议所讨论的一些内容。由路透社与合众社的报导中判断，在议程中有二项主要问题：贝尔格莱特匪帮在目前已被暴露，该如何利用它；美国在东欧国家中的阴谋失败以及与此相关的将来可能采取的步骤。
    这倒不是秘密的，美国外交人员在人民民主国家中不是为了促进美国与这些国家之间的友谊，而是要从中破坏东欧诸国的现政府。杜勒斯所制订的“Ｘ行动”，并不隐瞒其“袖里藏刀”的卑鄙外交手段：阴谋颠覆国家政权，秘密暗杀与破坏。美国在东欧国家政策的目的，就是破坏民主政权，以便恢复地主与资本家们的政权，而变这些国家为美国的桥头堡。这种政策证明了是失败的并遭遇到人民坚决的打击，是毫不足怪的。
    美国务院为伦敦会议所预备的报告中（原文也可从报纸上看到），企图分析美国外交人员在人民民主国家招致失败的原因，但它只讨论到技术方面，而没有深入到问题的本质。
    透露出来的消息说，美国对付人民民主国家的外交政策，其战略路线是基于对于这些国家内部情况的错误判断，尤其是对于民主力量和反动力量之间对比关系的错误判断。国务院从它的大使们那里获得了不正确的情报。我们从某些与美英“外交厨房”有密切接触的人士的透露中，可以知道那些所谓有关苏联与人民民主国家的“可靠情报”是如何捏造的。它们完全是从伪造与诽谤的泥井中汲取的，它们的作者尽可能地讨好国务院主子，而把情况描写得合乎他们主子的口味。
    华盛顿的外交政策，是由那些盲目仇恨苏联与人民民主政权的人士所决定的。这批家伙低估了工人阶级的力量，并忽视了群众觉悟的提高，特别是忽视了人民对于和平的渴望以及对于战贩宣传的深痛恶绝。国务院决定它的策略时，一心情愿地认为人民民主政权软弱无能，并过高地估计了反动力量。
    人民民主国家有成就的经济建设，它们政权的稳定与共产党威信大大地不断地提高，——这一类的事实，对于华盛顿而言，都是不愉快的出乎意料之外的事情。
    据报纸报道，下面的有趣事情是在伦敦会议上透露出来的。当华盛顿开始怀疑从人民民主国家中所接获的情报时，它就派遣了特别代理人到欧洲去观察五一劳动节游行、青年节、群众庆祝会、国际和平日游行等等。那些观察者在商人、教授、学生、记者的伪装下前去旅行，结果他们将所得印象报告给华盛顿，使国务院认清不仅其侦探情报活动完全失败，而它的思想战争也是一败涂地。
    我们知道，美国的宣传带着这种愚蠢观念，即“共产主义内部会分崩的”，整个世界都急于采取美国的生活方式与华尔街的思想。在伦敦会议中，国务院的代表们被迫承认这些想法只能哄骗舆论，而且，在实际上，如果有什么东西在人民民主国家中分崩的话，那末，最主要的是美国的宣传。
    据报纸关于伦敦会议的报导，美国务院对其外交人员非常的恼怒，因为他们造出一种错误的印象，即：“美国之音”的广播是在使欧洲人民信奉华尔街的教义，因为他们隐昵了一些事实，如人家对它的广播并不认真收听，如它所广播的事情是歪曲得如此明显，以致只激起了听者之愤怒与嘲笑。这证明了用成百万的美元来毒化人民民主国家人民意见，而欲引他们走入歧途，以便促成美帝国主义的破坏计划，是完全白费的。
    国务院同时召开这两个外交人员会议，不单是检讨一下它的失败，而且想制订出将来行动的路线。它的想法，一方面是加强在欧洲侦探与情报的活动，另一方面是加强美国宣传。为此目的，国务院才创制“心理战体制”，它的正式名称为“各部外交情报部”，它将由国防部、马歇尔计划总署、与从事间谍及情报工作和散布美国造谣宣传工作的其他机构的代表所组成。这些部门，将合力试图改进为国务院所发现的在其活动中的缺点。
    “心理战”只是美帝国主义者向民主阵营进行的“冷战”的一个组成部分。独占报纸公开地宣称，将来冷战的战略，在伦敦会议中缜密制订。这意味着它正拟具了新的反苏计划与反苏联反人民民主国家、反和平的新的丑恶的秘密阴谋。现在难以说出美国将如何改进它的“心理战体制”以便在欧洲进行破坏活动。目前是旧酒装新瓶。例证就是说，修正冷战战略，特别注意要利用铁托匪帮。
    华尔街代理人铁托匪帮的暴露，对于帝国主义者在东欧的整个阴谋体系，不啻是个致命的打击。国务院与美国的情报头子正在绞尽脑汁，想出该如何利用铁托匪帮以便达成他们的破坏目标，因为铁托匪帮现已不能再作为秘密代理人利用了。贝尔格莱特已必须列为美帝的公开附庸国一类。在第四届联合国大会上，铁托官员们完全以美帝卑劣的代理人与走狗的姿态出现。
    美国与英国的报纸，在论述伦敦会议时，并不隐瞒美国务院是十分忙于讨论如何“援助”铁托与继续在将来利用铁托分子的问题。人们可以看到在这一方面现在已采取了什么步骤。首先是成立反动宣传机构，以便帮助铁托。它的工作就是替帝国主义所雇用的刺客，铁托法西斯集团遮掩其本来性质。为要更进一步地欺骗群众，右翼的“社会主义”分子也被命令活动起来了。于是美国特务机关就直接给予那些“社会主义者”以特定的使命到南斯拉夫去旅行。访问者来自各国，尤其是来自英国与意大利。报纸上满载着他们的印象与游记。他们把为美英帝国主义代理人铁托所建立的法西斯集团冒充为“社会主义”。
    我们不妨从这个角度来估价在伦敦成立的支持铁托分子的特别组织——英南友谊会。它是由一些国会议员所发起的，其中有斯坦雷·铁芬奈（主席），李曼宁（副主席），齐里亚库斯，约翰派克·诺曼杜特，与雷诺新闻外交编辑大卫雷蒙等。这个团体是用来毁害进步的英南协会的，因为后者曾经斥责过铁托匪帮的卑劣行为。新机构已宣布它将举办集会、演讲会、电影并发行期刊与小册子，“以便介绍今日南斯拉夫的各方面情况，包括政治、经济、社会与文化方面的成就与计划”。
    所谓成就是些什么，是知道的。僭夺政权与间谍的铁托匪帮已在南斯拉夫建立了法西斯式的警察政府。整个国家已变为一个军事集中营；工人的民主权利已被剥夺，思想自由也已不可能。经济方面，南斯拉夫已处在外国独占资本的控制之下，并正变为英美资本的农业的与原料的附庸物。工人的贫困已极厉害。这些就是夺取南斯拉夫政权的间谍与刺客匪帮们所控制下的政治与经济方面的“成就”。社会“成就”则意味着对于劳动人民残酷与野蛮的剥削。而他们的文化“成就”就是变国家为巨大的“该死太保”（秘密警察）地狱。这些“成就”就是工党倾慕者现在所宣传着的。
    人们不会看不到这个由铁托伙伴在伦敦组织的新团体包括了所谓“左倾”与“独立”的工党分子，齐里亚库斯当然也在其内。铁托分子的暴露，也揭露了那些“左倾者”的假面具，他们现在正公开地与帝国主义者的侦探、破坏分子勾结在一起。
    在伦敦成立的特别宣传机构对于贝尔格莱特法西斯匪帮的赞美，说明了帝国主义者的忽视铁托匪帮的失败与暴露，他们还想靠它的帮助，以便继续进行他们反对民主阵营的间谍破坏活动。
    和托洛茨基主义被揭穿后的相同的事情发生了。这些阴谋计划的被粉碎也是由于老毛病：过低地估计了民主与社会主义阵营的精神与政治力量。依赖着已被暴露并已臭名昭著的贝尔格莱特冒险者，正如英国的俗语所说，就像鞭打死马一样。铁托及其赞助者必被唾弃并成为历史的渣滓像帝国主义的代理人托洛茨基分子的下场一样。
    铁托代理机关只是华盛顿外交政策武库中的一件，但却是典型的一件。当他们疯狂地寻求进行“冷战”、“心理战”与其他同类战争（这些战争是准备真正屠杀战争的一个组成部分）的工具方法时，华盛顿战争贩子正弹着他们的老调，他们既没有新的观念，也没有新的政治力量。支离破碎的名誉扫地的反动党派与阶级的残余、直至于昨天的希特勒分子、以梵蒂冈为首的天主教反动派、和已与新法西斯者同化了的右翼“社会主义”者——所有这些都是“死马”，都替他们做不了什么的。
    反动的华盛顿决策者并不急于寻出他们任何失败的合理结论。他们并没有表示将采取更现实的政策，放弃反苏联反人民民主国家的阴谋与诡计，而从两种制度并存的可能性出发，老老实实地认真地与这些国家合作。
    这是没有疑问的，如果华盛顿的自作聪明者继续他们的冷战政策，继续鞭驱他们的“死马”，而固执着“袖里藏刀”的战略的话，那末，更大的失败在等待着他们落得个不光荣的羞耻的下场。最近在保加利亚揭露美英间谍秘密活动的事实就可以证明。最近发布的保加利亚最高检察官对于科斯托夫叛国案的起诉书，是对于华盛顿政策的严重打击。
