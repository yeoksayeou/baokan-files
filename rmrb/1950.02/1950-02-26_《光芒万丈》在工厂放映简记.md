　　Brief Notes on Screening "Boundless Radiance" in Factories
　　Xijin

    In order to implement the policy of serving workers, peasants, and soldiers with films, the Film Bureau of the Ministry of Culture organized two factory screening teams. One team went to factories in the Tianjin area, and the other toured major factories in the suburbs of Beijing.

    These two factory screening teams departed from Beijing at the end of December 1949, carrying the feature film "Boundless Radiance," which portrays the initiative and creativity of the working class. The Beijing team successively toured the 70th Arsenal, Shijingshan Power Plant, Shijingshan Steel Plant, Changxindian Railway Factory, Fengtai Railway Machinery Plant, and other places, providing a great education to the worker audiences, enhancing their class consciousness, and enabling them to learn many things.

    "Boundless Radiance" depicts the class consciousness of workers led by Zhou Mingying after liberation. Under the factory's democratized management system, Zhou Mingying displayed initiative and creativity in her work, and motivated the masses, enabling the power plant, which had been damaged by the Chiang Kai-shek gang, to be quickly restored. The worker audiences were deeply moved by Zhou Mingying, and they put forward the slogan "Learn from Zhou Mingying."

    In addition, "Boundless Radiance" also made the workers realize the importance of combining theory and practice, and that engineers and workers must cooperate better to ensure the development of production; it also raised their vigilance in preventing sabotage and fire in their work, and their attention to the education of their families.

    After each film screening, the workers held discussion sessions or study groups to discuss the film. They connected the typical characters in the film to their own work and attitudes towards life.

    They eagerly learned from the film, using the characters in the film to measure themselves, demand of themselves, and strive towards as their direction; at the same time, they also put forward many criticisms regarding technical aspects of "Boundless Radiance" based on their own work experience.

    Based on the experience of this screening, we are convinced that: by having the screening teams bring people's films to the workers, not only is the educational role of films greatly enhanced; moreover, it will also enable the production of future films to be continuously improved as they are tested among the masses.

　　《光芒万丈》在工厂放映简记
　　昔今
    文化部电影局为了实践电影为工农兵服务的方针，组织了两个工厂放映队，一队到天津区工厂里去放映，一队到北京郊区的各大工厂去巡回放映。
    这两个工厂放映队，在一九四九年十二月底由北京出发，携带的影片，就是表现工人阶级积极性与创造性的故事片《光芒万丈》。北京区的一队先后到七十兵工厂、石景山发电所、石景山炼钢厂、长辛店铁路工厂、丰台铁路机厂等处巡回放映，给了工人观众很大的教育，使他们提高了阶级觉悟，并学习了很多东西。
    《光芒万丈》表现了解放后的以周明英为首的工人们的阶级觉悟。在工厂管理民主化的制度下，周明英发挥了工作的积极性和创造性，并且带动了群众，使被蒋匪帮破坏了的发电厂迅速的恢复起来。工人观众们深深被周明英所感动，他们提出了“向周明英学习”的口号。
    此外，《光芒万丈》又使工人们认识了理论与经验结合的重要性，认识了工程师和工友们必须更好的合作，才能保证生产事业的发展；并提高了他们工作中防特防火的警惕性和对家属教育的重视。
    各处电影映完后，工人们都进行了讨论这个电影的座谈会或学习会。他们从电影中的典型人物，连系到自己的工作和生活态度。
    他们急切地向电影学习，拿电影里的人物，来衡量自己，要求自己，作为自己努力的方向；同时他们又根据自己在工作中所得到的经验，向《光芒万丈》提出了关于技术方面的许多批评。
    根据这次放映的经验，使我们确信：由放映队把人民电影运到工人中间去，不仅更大地发挥了电影的教育作用；而且，也会使今后电影的撮制，因在群众中受到了考验，而不断地提高。
