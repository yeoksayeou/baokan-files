Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, February 10th: According to a TASS dispatch from New York on February 9th: Draper, the vice president of the powerful Wall Street firm Dillon, Read & Co., delivered a speech at a meeting hosted by the Foreign Policy Association, urging American companies to "begin formulating plans in Japan."

Draper is the former Under Secretary of the Army and recently returned from a visit to Japan a few weeks ago. While in Japan, he studied "opportunities" for American investment. Draper specifically mentioned Japan's steel industry, aluminum industry, coal industry, chemical industry, rayon industry, electrical industry, heavy machinery industry, light machinery industry, and shipbuilding industry as profitable sectors for American investment. Draper claimed that American monopoly capital could gain control of Japanese industry at a very low cost. He predicted that Japan's puppet government would, within months, amend existing laws and regulations to "encourage" foreign investment.

Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, February 10th: After the four US Chiefs of Staff conferred with MacArthur on US aggression plans in the Far East, MacArthur has begun instructing its vassal state, the Philippines, on the tasks it should undertake. According to a United Press dispatch from Tokyo, Philippine Defense Minister Conelio flew to Tokyo on the 9th to hear MacArthur's so-called "new US plan to prevent communist expansion in Asia," and to discuss the Philippines' "defense plan." While in Tokyo, Conelio stated: MacArthur will "tell us about his discussions with the four US Chiefs of Staff." He also stated: His government is "extremely concerned about the possibility of Taiwan falling into the hands of the Chinese Communists." Therefore, Conelio's so-called Philippine "defense plan," for which he is seeking instructions from his American master, is clearly related to the US attempt to prevent the Chinese People's Liberation Army from liberating Taiwan.

    鼓吹美资侵日
    菲国防部长飞日活动
    【新华社北京十日电】据塔斯社纽约九日讯：华尔街势力雄厚的狄陇里德公司的副经理德莱柏，在美国外交政策协会主持的演讲会上发表演说，敦促美国公司“开始拟订在日本的计划”。
    德莱柏是美国前陆军部次长，数周前访日归来。在日本时，他曾研究美国投资的“机会”，德莱柏具体提到日本的钢铁业、铝业、煤炭业、化学品业、人造丝业、电器工业、重机器业、轻机器业和造船业，是美国投资的有利可图的部门。德莱柏称，美国垄断资本可以用很低的代价取得日本工业的控制权。他预料日本的傀儡政府将在数月以内，修改现行的法律和规例，借以“鼓励”外国的投资。
    【新华社北京十日电】在美国四参谋长与麦克阿瑟商订美国在远东的侵略计划后，麦克阿瑟已着手向其附庸国家菲律宾指示所应负的任务。据合众社东京消息，菲律宾国防部长康利容于九日飞抵东京，听取麦克阿瑟关于所谓“美国阻止共产党在亚洲扩张的新计划”。并讨论菲律宾的“防务计划”。康利容在东京称：麦克阿瑟将“告诉我们关于他与美国四参谋长的讨论情形”。并称：他的政府“异常担心台湾可能陷入中国共产党之手”。因此，康利容向其美国主子请示的所谓菲律宾的“防务计划”，显与美国妄图阻挠中国人民解放军解放台湾的计划有关。
