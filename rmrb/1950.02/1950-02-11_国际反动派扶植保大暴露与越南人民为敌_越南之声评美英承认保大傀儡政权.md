Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, February 9th. The US and British governments simultaneously announced on the 7th their recognition of the Bảo Đại puppet regime, Cambodia, and Laos as "independent states" within the French Union. "Voice of Vietnam" commented on the 8th on this recognition by the United States and Britain, saying: "This is not surprising to the Vietnamese people, who foresaw this long ago. What surprises us is that the international reactionaries seem to believe that international recognition and more material assistance can make the Bảo Đại puppet government pass itself off as the representative of the Vietnamese people. But Bảo Đại is, after all, a puppet, a traitor. The Vietnamese people have demanded his execution for his three betrayals of the motherland. Therefore, he can never be recognized by the whole nation." "Voice of Vietnam" concluded: The fact that French imperialists and international reactionaries support such a traitor fully demonstrates who is the mortal enemy of Vietnamese national independence.

    越南之声评美英承认保大傀儡政权
    【新华社北京九日电】美英两国政府已于七日同时宣布承认保大傀儡政权、柬埔寨及老挝为法兰西联邦内的“独立国”。“越南之声”于八日评论美国和英国的这种承认称：“这对越南人民是并不奇怪的，他们在很久以前就预料到这一点。使我们惊异的是国际反动派似乎相信：国际承认和更多的物质援助，就能使保大傀儡政府混充越南人民的代表。但保大终究是一个傀儡，一个卖国贼。越南人民已因他的三次叛卖祖国而要求处以极刑。所以他永远不能得到全民族的承认。”“越南之声”最后称：法国帝国主义者及国际反动派扶植这样一个卖国贼，充分说明了究竟谁是越南民族独立的死敌。
