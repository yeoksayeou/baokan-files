Two Styles of Production Leadership, Two Results
	Zhong Yun, Tao Ke, Yuan Liang

The different leadership styles in production leadership in Ganquan and Mizhi counties, northern Shaanxi, in 1949, produced two different results.

Due to the erroneous views of leading cadres in Mizhi County who disregarded production leadership, and their serious bureaucratic style, the county's post-war production recovery work was severely hindered. Last year, the county leadership issued seven production directives, but failed to conduct any inspections or summaries. During the summer and autumn, the masses lacked food and seeds, and were plagued by drought and insect pests, especially the epidemic of diseases, with more than 10,000 patients in the county, which seriously hindered production. However, the county leadership still did not pay attention, and only issued a simple production directive as usual, without actively trying to solve the threat of disease to the masses. As a result, due to the lack of good organization of mutual aid teams and labor adjustments, 12,600 mu of autumn crops that had already sprouted were left uncultivated. As of the end of last year, more than 50,000 mu of cultivated land in Minquan and Longzhen districts were still barren (nearly one-third of the original cultivated area of the two districts). During the summer grain requisition last year, phenomena that violated policies occurred. For example, cadres in townships of Minquan district, not proceeding from the basic point of view of developing production, added two-thirds of the several dan of public grain of an administrative village in seven townships to the dozen or so members of the Sunjiaqu mutual aid team, causing widespread dissatisfaction among the team members and a decline in production enthusiasm.

The main reason for the above serious situation is that the county leadership neither studied nor reviewed the administrative office's production instructions and criticisms of the county's poor production leadership. After the county head signed "acknowledged," they were hung on the wall. Cadres of the Shaanxi Agricultural Department and reporters of the Shaanxi Masses Daily reflected that leading cadres in Mizhi County generally held erroneous views on leading production. They regarded production leadership as a "soft task," believing that production tasks could be stretched or shrunk, the time could be fast or slow, and the masses would do it themselves, while regarding other tasks such as land registration and assessment of normal yields as "hard tasks" that must be completed on time. Therefore, they put the cart before the horse, subordinating the most basic production leadership issue to other busy and chaotic work.

Ganquan County also suffered severe drought, insect pests, and disease epidemics last year, and the masses generally lacked food and seeds. However, because the leading cadres in the county attached importance to leading the masses in production, the county became one of the counties in northern Shaanxi that recovered the fastest from the wounds of war.

First of all, the county leadership determined that the central task for 1949 was to gradually restore and develop agriculture and sideline production on the basis of the 1948 production and disaster relief; other work would be carried out around this central task.

When spring plowing began, the county-level leadership selected four districts and four townships with a good mass base from the 1944 Great Production Movement as strongholds, and sent Ding Mingsheng, the director of the Fourth Section of the County Government, to directly lead the masses in production to create experience and promote the overall situation. After Ding Mingsheng arrived in the township, he first convened meetings of township and village cadres and party members, repeatedly explaining the importance of leading production and the methods of leadership in connection with disaster relief, and discussed with the masses to formulate specific production plans, consciously cultivating the mutual aid team led by Liang Xiuying, making it a model of cooperative mutual aid production. Under the leadership of Liang Xiuying, six mutual aid team members reclaimed 42 mu of wasteland in the spring. During the spring plowing, Liang Xiuying took out her three hoes to adjust to farmers who lacked tools, and used Yicang grain to solve the food difficulties of four poor households, thereby promoting low-interest loans in the whole township, adjusting a total of twelve dan and eight dou of fine grain and twenty-five pieces of agricultural tools, so that production in the whole township progressed smoothly. After the summer cultivation, the mutual aid team went to Lang County to thresh wheat for more than 20 days, earning three dan, one dou and seven sheng of wheat, making significant achievements in production work. In order to educate the masses in the whole township, Li Baisheng used the temple fair to reward Liang Xiuying's mutual aid team, promoting a surge of mutual aid and cooperation among the masses, and ensuring that more than 12,000 mu of autumn crops in the whole township were weeded twice in the summer.

The county leadership absorbed the experience of leading Liang Xiuying's mutual aid team, learned the method of creating and promoting key leadership, and adhered to the inspection system of transmitting experience in the decentralized rural environment. Therefore, it frequently dispatched the county's main cadres to go deep into the townships to help village and township cadres lead production, paying attention to creating experience. The secretary of the county party committee and the county head also frequently took turns going to the countryside, focusing on organizing experience exchanges. Last year, 87% of the cadres in the county spent more than seven months working in the countryside. The county specially sent cadres to each district to spread leadership experience six times, and also issued three circulars to guide district and township cadres in production leadership work.

Because they conducted inspections in a down-to-earth manner, they were able to solve various problems that occurred in the countryside in a timely manner. During the spring plowing, there were 28 laborers in Youfang Village, one township of the Third District, but the district government did not organize them. After the county-level cadres discovered this, they immediately corrected it and helped establish a mutual aid team. As a result of this cooperation and mutual assistance, not only was all the original cultivated land in the village planted, but also more than 230 mu of wasteland was reclaimed. It also promoted the establishment of eight children's mutual aid teams in four townships. To the best of their ability, the children cooperated with the spring plowing to participate in auxiliary labor, digging more than 300 mu of grain stubble and weeding 250 mu in the summer cultivation. When the masses were rushing to plant autumn crops in the summer, the work team in Yangban Village, one township of the Second District, found that more than 50 people in Yangban Village and other places were suffering from yellow water vomiting. The cadres immediately went to express their condolences, and the county government immediately dispatched doctors to treat them, eliminating the disease and ensuring the progress of production work. During the tense season of autumn harvest, the county inspectors found that the masses in Laoshan Village generally had a lazy phenomenon of getting up very late. The village and township cadres said: "This is the habit of the old people." The inspectors, on the one hand, pointed out their erroneous attitude of letting things take their own course, and on the other hand, set an example by personally urging them door-to-door every morning for three consecutive days, educating the masses and launching the autumn harvest movement in Laoshan Village enthusiastically.

In addition, the county also carried out work such as resettling refugees and taking care of the production of revolutionary martyrs, soldiers, and workers' families. Therefore, in 1949, on the basis of 85% of the original cultivated area having been restored in 1948, all the pre-war cultivated land of 160,000 mu was restored, and the number of livestock recovered and exceeded the pre-war number by 330 heads (6,759 heads before the war). The average per capita agricultural harvest increased from seven dou and eight sheng in 1948 to one shi and two dou, approaching the highest harvest of one shi and three dou per capita before the war.

　　生产领导上的两种作风两种结果
    仲蕴　陶克　远亮
    一九四九年陕北甘泉和米脂两县生产领导上的两种不同的领导作风，产生的两种不同的结果。
    米脂县领导干部由于存在着漠视生产领导的错误观点和严重的官僚主义作风，因而使该县战后生产的恢复工作受到严重阻碍。去年一年内该县领导机关曾发了七次生产指示，但并未进行任何检查和总结。夏秋间，群众缺乏食粮、种籽，又加旱灾、虫灾，特别是疾病流行，全县有一万余病人，严重地妨碍着生产。可是县的领导机关仍未引起注意，只照例的发了一个简单的生产指示，并没有积极想办法去解除群众的疾病威胁。结果因没有很好的组织变工互助，调剂劳力，致使已着苗的秋禾，荒芜了一万二千六百亩。该县民权、龙镇两区直到去年年底，还荒芜着五万余亩熟地（几近该两区原耕地面积三分之一）。在去年夏征中，发生了违犯政策的现象，如民权区区乡干部，不从发展生产的基本观点出发，将七乡一个行政村数石公粮的三分之二，加在孙家渠十几户变工队员的身上，引起了该队队员的普遍不满，生产情绪低落。
    造成上述严重情形主要由于该县领导机关对于行署的生产指示和对该县领导生产不力的批评既不研究，又不检讨，仅经县长签一“知”后，就挂在墙上。陕北农业处干部与陕北群众日报记者反映米脂领导干部对领导生产普遍存在着错误观点。他们把生产领导看成“软任务”，认为生产任务可伸可缩，时间可快可慢，群众自己会干，而将其他土地登记、评定通常产量等，看成“硬任务”，到时候非完成不可。因而本末倒置的将最基本的生产领导问题，依附了忙忙乱乱的其他工作。
    甘泉县去年也发生了严重的旱、虫等灾和疾病流行，群众普遍缺乏粮食种籽，但因该县领导干部重视领导群众进行生产，因此，该县成为陕北医治战争创伤最快的一个县份。
    首先，该县领导机关确定一九四九年的中心工作为在一九四八年生产救灾的基础上，逐步恢复与发展农业、副业生产；其他工作则围绕这一中心工作进行。
    当春耕开始时，县级领导就选定一九四四年大生产运动中，群众基础较好的四区四乡作为据点，并派遣县府四科长丁目生直接领导群众生产以创造经验推动全盘。丁目生到达该乡后，首先召开了乡、村干部、党员会议，联系救灾等反复说明领导生产的重要和领导方法，并和群众商量订出具体生产计划，有意识的培养梁秀英所领导的变工队，使他成为合作互助的生产模范。在梁秀英的带头下，六个变工队员春季开荒四十二亩。在春耕中梁秀英拿出自己的三把锄头调剂给缺工具的农户，并用义仓粮解决了四家贫苦户的食粮困难，从而推进了全乡的低利借贷，共调剂出细粮十二石八斗，农具二十五件，使全乡生产顺利进展。在夏耘后，该变工组并赴廊县赶麦场二十多天，赚麦子三石一斗七升，使生产工作获得显著成绩。为教育全乡群众，李白生利用庙会，奖励了梁秀英变工队，推动了群众间互助合作的热潮，保证了全乡一万二千余亩秋禾夏季锄草两次。
    该县领导机关吸取了对梁秀英变工队领导的经验，并学会了创造与推广重点领导的方法，和坚持了在分散的农村环境中的传递经验的巡视制度，因此，便经常分派县上主要干部深入各乡帮助村乡干部领导生产，注意创造经验。该县中共县委书记和县长也经常轮流下乡，侧重组织经验交流。去年一年内，全县百分之八十七的干部，在农村工作的时间共有七个多月，县上专派干部至各区传播领导经验共六次，此外还发出了三次通报，指导区乡干部进行生产领导工作。
    由于他们脚踏实地的进行巡视检查，所以能及时的解决农村中所发生的各种问题。春耕中三区一乡油房村有二十八个劳力，区政府没有加以组织，县级干部发现后，立即进行纠正，并帮助建立了变工队，这样合作互助的结果，不仅种完了全村原有熟地，而且开荒地二百三十余亩；并推动成立了四乡八个儿童的变工队，在儿童们力所能及的情况下，配合春耕参加辅助劳动，共掏谷槎三百余亩，夏耘中锄草二百五十亩。夏天群众抢种秋禾时，二区一乡的工作组发现杨坂村等地有五十余人患吐黄水病，干部即亲赴慰问，县府也立即抽派医生前往救治，扑灭了病患，保证了生产工作的进行。在秋收的紧张季节里，该县巡视员发现劳山村群众普遍有起床很迟的散漫现象，村、乡干部说：“这是老百性的习惯。”巡视员一方面指出其放任自流的错误态度，一方面以身作则，连续三天早晨挨门逐户亲自督促，对群众进行教育，使劳山村的秋收运动热烈展开。
    此外，该县并进行安置移难民、照顾烈、军、工属生产等工作。因而在一九四九年内，从一九四八年已恢复原耕地面积百分之八十五的基础上，全部恢复了战前耕地十六万亩，牲畜恢复并超过战前数目三百三十头（战前为六千七百五十九头），每人平均农业收获量，由一九四八年的七斗八升，提高至一石二斗，接近了战前每人平均一石三斗的最高收获量。
