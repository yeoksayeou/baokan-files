　　Learning from the Advanced Military Science of the Soviet Union
　　Zhu De
    Today is the 32nd anniversary of the founding of the Soviet Armed Forces. This is a day worthy of celebration by all progressive people around the world. The Soviet Armed Forces are the faithful defenders of the interests of the working people of the world and the faithful defenders of world democracy and peace. Since the emergence of the great socialist country of the Soviet Union and the emergence of this armed force of the working people themselves, the working people of the world have had a reliance, and the world's reactionaries can no longer run rampant as they did before.
    The Soviet Armed Forces have now become the most powerful army in the world. It has traveled a glorious road. The foreign armed interventionists who invaded the Soviet Union after the October Revolution suffered defeat before it; in the Second World War, the German and Japanese fascist bandits suffered defeat before it. These facts prove that the powerful Soviet Armed Forces are invincible.
    The reason why the Soviet Armed Forces can become an invincible army is because it has grown and developed under the education of communism and under the guidance of the most advanced military science represented by Stalin. It not only has a high degree of political consciousness and a high degree of organization and discipline, but also has a high level of military skill to skillfully master all modern weapons. Today, as we commemorate the anniversary of the founding of the Soviet Armed Forces, we must earnestly learn from these advantages of the Soviet army, absorb the Soviet experience in building the army, and further strengthen the construction of our People's Liberation Army so that it is sufficient to undertake the sacred task of crossing the sea to annihilate the remaining bandits and defend national defense, and jointly with the armed forces of our fraternal ally, the Soviet Union, undertake the responsibility of guarding peace in the Far East.

　　学习苏联的先进军事科学
　　朱德
    今天是苏联武装部队建军三十二周年，这是值得全世界进步人类共同庆祝的一个日子。苏联武装部队是世界劳动人民利益的忠实捍卫者，是世界民主和平的忠实捍卫者。自从世界上出现了伟大的社会主义国家苏联，并出现了这支劳动人民自己的武装以后，全世界劳动人民就有了依靠，世界反动派就再不能像原先那样任意横行了。
    苏联武装部队现已成为世界上最强大的军队。它已走过一段光荣的道路。十月革命后侵入苏联的外国武装干涉者在它面前遭受了失败；第二次世界大战中，德、日法西斯强盗又在它面前遭受了失败。这些事实证明了强大的苏联武装部队是不可被战胜的。
    苏联武装部队之所以能成为战无不胜的军队，是由于它是在共产主义的教育下面，是在以斯大林为代表的最先进的军事科学指导下面生长和发展起来的。它不仅有着高度的政治觉悟，有着高度的组织性、纪律性，而且有着能熟练掌握一切近代武器的高度军事技巧。我们今天来纪念苏联武装部队建军节，就要认真学习苏联军队的这些优点，吸取苏联建军经验，进一步加强我们人民解放军的建设，使它足以担当渡海歼灭残匪和保卫国防的神圣任务，并和我们兄弟盟国苏联的武装部队共同担负起警卫远东和平的责任。
