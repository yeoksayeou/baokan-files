　　United in Solidarity, Persisting in a Strike for Forty-Four Days
    Hong Kong Tram Workers Achieve Initial Victory
    Capitalists Forced to Promise Factory Reopening and Cancel Dismissal of Workers
    【Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, 11th】After persisting in a strike for forty-four days, Hong Kong tram workers have achieved an initial victory and fully resumed work on the 10th. Hong Kong tram transportation also resumed on the same day. The tram company capitalists were forced to promise to reopen the factory, cancel the decision to dismiss workers, guarantee the fulfillment of all previously agreed-upon rights of the workers, and continue negotiations with the workers regarding their demands after resuming work. The Hong Kong Government Police Department promised to withdraw from the tram workers' union hall and be responsible for compensating all losses from the destruction of the union hall. However, regarding the issue of wages during the strike, the capitalists evaded responsibility, claiming it would be resolved through "legal means." Regarding the workers' proposed special allowance, negotiations would be held after the ongoing arbitration of the Kowloon Dairy labor dispute yields results. The tram workers' union has issued a formal statement, pointing out that after resuming work, workers will continue to strive to realize the above interests, release arrested workers, and restore the right of workers forced to leave the country to return to Hong Kong. When the tram workers recovered the union hall on the morning of the 10th, they held a grand flag-raising ceremony for the national flag of the People's Republic of China. The Hong Kong tram workers' strike began at the end of last year. Due to rising prices and insufficient income to maintain a minimum standard of living, tram workers requested the capitalists to issue special allowances and year-end bonuses, as well as related worker benefits. However, the capitalists rejected all the workers' demands except for the year-end bonus. The capitalists' unreasonable refusal aroused extreme indignation among the workers. After repeated unsuccessful negotiations, all tram workers went on strike on December 24th, continuing to drive trams but not selling tickets to facilitate the public's convenience, while hoping that the capitalists would sincerely reopen negotiations. However, the capitalists not only showed no sincerity in reopening negotiations but also announced the closure of the factory and the dismissal of all ticket sellers on the 28th. The tram workers' strike thus expanded. On the 30th of last month, the British Hong Kong government carried out armed suppression of more than three thousand tram, telephone, and electric light industry workers who were gathering for a solidarity event, resulting in a bloody tragedy. However, the tram workers persisted without yielding and received enthusiastic support from the entire nation of China and the people of Hong Kong and Kowloon. With the united persistence of the workers and the support of the broad masses of the Chinese people, the Hong Kong tram workers' strike finally ended in victory.

　　团结一致坚持罢工四十四天
    港电车工人初步胜利   
    资方被迫承许开厂并取消开除工人决定
    【新华社广州十一日电】坚持罢工四十四日的香港电车工人于获得初步胜利后，已于十日全体复工，香港电车交通亦于同日恢复。电车公司资方被迫承许开厂，取消开除工人的决定，保证履行已答应工人的一切权益的诺言，并于复工后与工人继续谈判工人的要求。香港政府警务署则承许退出电车工会会所，并负责赔偿捣毁会所的一切损失。但关于罢工期间的工资问题，资方推诿将以“法律方式”解决，对于工人提出的特别津贴问题，则待正在进行仲裁的牛奶公司劳资纠纷得到结果后再行谈判。电车工会已发表正式声明，指出复工后工人将继续为实现以上各项利益、释放被捕工友、恢复被迫出境工友回港的权利而坚持力争。电车工人于十日上午收回工会会所时，曾举行了隆重的中华人民共和国国旗升旗礼。按香港电车工潮系于去年年底发生。电车工人因物价上涨，收入不足维持最低生活，向资方提出发给特别津贴和年底花红及有关工人福利等合理要求，但资方对职工的要求，除允发给年底花红外，其余一概拒绝，资方的无理拒绝当引起职工极度的愤慨。经反复交涉无效后，全体电车工人乃于去年十二月二十四日实行怠工，照常开车但不卖票，以照顾市民的便利，同时希望资方诚意重开谈判。然资方不但毫无重开谈判的诚意，反而于二十八日宣布封闭厂房，开除全体售票员。电车工潮由是扩大。上月三十日，香港英政府更对正在集会慰问联欢的三千余电车、电话、电灯等业工人施行武装镇压，酿成大流血惨案。但电车工人坚持不屈，并获得了中国全国和港九人民的热烈支援。在工人团结一致坚持斗争和广大中国人民的支持下，香港电车工人的罢工终于获得胜利而结束。
