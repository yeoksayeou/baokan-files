Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, February 24th – TASS reports: The Budapest Criminal Court of Hungary publicly tried Vogeler, Sanders, American and British spies, and their Hungarian accomplices, Gieger, and others, beginning on the 17th. The defendants have all confessed. The case was concluded on the 21st, and the verdict was announced.

The defendant Gieger, the former General Manager of the Standard Radio and Telephone Factory in Budapest and a Hungarian citizen, and Redei, the former Director of the Industrial Department and a Hungarian citizen, were sentenced to death. Vogeler, the Director of the Standard Factory in Eastern Europe, representative of the American concern International Standard Electric Corporation, and an American citizen, was sentenced to 15 years imprisonment. Sanders, one of the administrators of the Standard Factory and an American citizen, was sentenced to 13 years imprisonment. Domokos, the Director of the Standard Factory and a Hungarian citizen, and Just, a priest of the Roman Catholic Church and a Hungarian citizen, were each sentenced to 10 years imprisonment. Countess Gil, a Hungarian citizen, was sentenced to 5 years imprisonment.

Espionage Charges

The indictment presented by the Hungarian State Prosecutor's Office accuses the defendants of the following crimes: Gieger had been working at the Standard Factory, which belongs to the International Standard Electric Corporation, since 1924. After the liberation of Hungary, he became the General Manager of the factory and, following the instructions of Vogeler, a disguised American trade representative, Colonel Benn of the United States, and others, engaged in espionage activities, providing them with classified national information of Hungary. His sabotage activities caused the Hungarian national economy to lose millions of florins (Hungarian currency).

Redei lived in Britain before World War II and was sent to Hungary by British intelligence agencies in 1945 to carry out activities. Later, he was hired by American intelligence agencies to sell Hungarian state secrets to Vogeler, causing the country to lose more than 14 million florins.

Vogeler was a spy for the American intelligence service. He recruited intelligence personnel in Hungary to carry out large-scale espionage activities. The instructions he received were: (1) to carry out political, economic, and military espionage activities; (2) to carry out sabotage and subversive activities in the Standard Factory in Hungary.

Sanders had been working for British intelligence since 1940. After the war, he engaged in espionage activities as the head of the British group of the Allied Control Commission. Later, he was sent to the Standard Factory. He also served the American intelligence service and obtained intelligence with the assistance of Just and others.

Hungarian State Prosecutor General Arabi said in court on the 20th that the defendants' sabotage was carried out under the direct instructions of the heads of American companies. During the war, the Standard Factory, on the orders of its American masters, devoted all its efforts to production to supply fascist Germany with transportation equipment. After the liberation of Hungary, the company only used half its strength for production to undermine the Hungarian national economy. This trial also proves that a large number of diplomatic representatives from the United States and Britain are engaged in espionage activities in the Soviet Union and people's democracies. Instructions and secret reports on espionage activities are transmitted through their embassies as diplomatic mail. These defendants are violent enemies of the democracy, freedom, and independence of all nations.

　　匈宣判美英间谍案  福格勒等被处徒刑
    【新华社北京二十四日电】综合塔斯社消息：匈牙利布达佩斯刑事法庭于十七日起公开审讯美、英间谍福格勒、杉德斯及其匈籍走狗吉格尔等七人，被告均已服罪。该案业于二十一日审理完毕，并宣布了判决的结果。
    被告前布达佩斯标准无线电与电话工厂总经理、匈牙利公民吉格尔和前工业部处长、匈牙利公民雷第奥判处死刑；标准工厂驻东欧主任、美国康采恩国际标准电器公司代表、美国公民福格勒处十五年徒刑；布达佩斯标准工厂行政人员之一、美国公民杉德斯处十三年徒刑；标准工厂主任、匈牙利公民多莫科斯和罗马天主教会教士、匈牙利公民尤斯特各处十年徒刑；前男爵夫人、匈牙利公民吉尔处五年徒刑。
    间谍罪状
    匈牙利国家检察署提出的起诉书控告被告的罪状如下：吉格尔自一九二四年起即任职于国际标准电器公司所属的标准工厂，匈牙利解放后，他任工厂总经理，并遵照伪装的美国贸易代表福格勒、美国上校本恩等人的训令，从事间谍活动，供给他们匈牙利的国家机密情报。他的破坏活动使匈牙利国民经济损失数百万佛罗林（匈币）。
    雷第奥在第二次大战前住在英国，一九四五年由英国谍报机关派来凶牙利进行活动，其后，他又被美国谍报机关雇用，出卖匈牙利国家机密给福格勒，曾使国家损失一千四百余万佛罗林。
    福格勒是美国情报处的间谍，他在匈牙利召募谍报人员，进行大规模间谍活动，其所接获的指令是：（一）进行政治、经济与军事的谍报活动；（二）在匈牙利的标准工厂中进行阴谋破坏与颠覆性活动。
    杉德斯自一九四○年起即任职于英国情报处，战后，他曾以盟国管制委员会英国组组长资格进行间谍活动，其后，被派到标准工厂。他又给美国谍报机关服务，并由尤斯特等人协助获取情报。
    匈牙利国家检察署署长阿拉比二十日在法庭发言称：被告的阴谋破坏行为，是按照美国公司首脑们的直接训令而进行的。在战争期间，标准工厂曾奉美国主人之命全力生产，以供给法西斯德国交通设备。匈牙利解放后，该公司却只用一半力量生产，以破坏匈牙利国民经济。这次的审讯也证明：美英两国大批的外交代表在苏联及人民民主国家进行间谍活动，关于间谍活动的训令和秘密报告，就是经由它们的公使馆当作外交邮件传递的。这些被告是各民族的民主、自由与独立的狂暴的敌人。
