　　We, the Beijing Second Session of the Second People's Representatives Conference, was held from February 25th to 27th.

When we were here in session, discussing Beijing's production and construction, we first thought of the conclusion of the great Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance, which is another unparalleled achievement for our motherland and people. We would like to express our highest respect and sincere gratitude to you.
