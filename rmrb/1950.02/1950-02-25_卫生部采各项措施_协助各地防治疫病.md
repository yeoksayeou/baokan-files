　　The Ministry of Health Adopts Various Measures to Assist Local Areas in Preventing and Controlling Epidemics
    [By Our Correspondent] Recently, infectious diseases have been discovered in many areas within the country. After receiving reports, the Ministry of Health of the Central People's Government has taken various prevention and control measures in response to the situation.

    In January, plague broke out in Lianjiang, Suixi, and other areas of the Leizhou Peninsula in Guangdong Province. This area was originally a plague-stricken region. The Ministry of Health immediately rushed 1 million doses of live plague vaccine there on January 28th for use. Subsequently, on January 30th, the ministry dispatched 154 personnel from the Northeast Anti-Epidemic Team, carrying 30 tons of medicines, equipment, and promotional materials, to the epidemic area to assist in prevention and control efforts. Plague also broke out successively in six counties, including Yanhai, Fuqing, and Putian in Fujian Province, and Wenzhou City in Zhejiang Province. The epidemic areas in Fujian Province were originally plague-stricken regions, and personnel from the "Southeast Plague Prevention and Control Office" taken over by the province were already conducting prevention and control work in the epidemic areas. After receiving a telegram from the Fujian Provincial Health Department on January 31st, the Ministry of Health immediately dispatched Captain Samula and others from the Inner Mongolia Anti-Epidemic Team on February 3rd, carrying promotional materials, to assist in the work, and introduced the experience of plague prevention and control in Northeast China and Inner Mongolia. In Zhejiang Province, five detachments of the Anti-Epidemic General Team from the Kuomintang era, which we took over, were stationed there. The equipment was very good and they had already been dispatched to the Wenzhou epidemic area to work. The Ministry of Health also dispatched some personnel from the Shanghai Quarantine Station to assist and sent a batch of live plague vaccine. In addition, in order to prevent the recurrence of plague in Chahar and Inner Mongolia, the Ministry of Health began preparing to establish the Chahar-Mongolia Plague Prevention and Control Institute in January to carry out regular rat and flea extermination, preventive vaccinations, and investigation and research.

    Many regions in various provinces and cities have recently discovered smallpox. There are epidemics in Dihua in Xinjiang, southern Sichuan Province, Shijiazhuang in Hebei Province, Gaoping in Shanxi, Runan in Henan, the Luzhongnan area of Shandong, Wuhu in southern Anhui, Nanchang in Jiangxi, Shantou in Guangdong, as well as cities such as Beijing, Tianjin, Nanjing, Shanghai, Wuhan, and parts of Northeast China. The Ministry of Health has successively sent approximately 300,000 units of smallpox vaccine to various places, which can be used for smallpox vaccination of nearly 20 million people, and has provided instructions on prevention and control methods. At the same time, the ministry has drafted draft interim regulations on vaccination and implementation measures for vaccination, which will be announced soon and ordered to be implemented in various places to effectively eliminate smallpox in a planned manner.

    In addition to plague and smallpox, an acute epidemic occurred in the Xiangyang and Zaoyang areas of Hubei, epidemic meningitis and diphtheria were discovered in Xinyang, Luoyang, and Shanxian in Henan, and epidemic typhus occurred in Luzhongnan and Inner Mongolia. The Ministry of Health has respectively dispatched medical personnel and allocated medicines to assist local prevention and control efforts. Recently, in order to strengthen the anti-epidemic forces, the Ministry of Health has ordered a large number of serums and vaccines from the Dalian Health Research Institute and the Beijing Temple of Heaven Anti-Epidemic Office. It also plans to establish a Kala-azar Prevention and Control Institute within six months, stationed in the Kala-azar epidemic areas on both sides of the Yellow River; and plans to organize mobile flea extermination teams in epidemic typhus and relapsing fever epidemic areas to carry out regular prevention and treatment work. The Central Anti-Epidemic General Team under the jurisdiction of the ministry will expand its organization, assist local health authorities in carrying out general health work in peacetime, and serve as a mobile force when epidemics occur. It has now begun purchasing medicines and equipment and preparing to train personnel. The ministry also plans to instruct major administrative regions to form anti-epidemic brigades for standby use.
