　　Promoting Agricultural Science and Technology
    Shanxi Five Hundred Agricultural Cadres Complete Training; Yuci Prefecture to Universally Launch Training Classes

    [Our Newspaper News] Shanxi News: The first batch of trainees from the Shanxi Provincial Department of Agriculture's agricultural cadre technical training classes, held in five districts across the province, completed their studies in mid-January.

    The first batch of agricultural cadre technical training classes in Shanxi Province consisted of 582 trainees (including four agricultural staff members from the prefectural commissioner's office and county agricultural chiefs, 94 county agricultural staff members, 319 district agricultural assistants, and 165 village cadres and labor heroes). They were trained in Taiyuan, Changzhi, Yicheng, Xingxian, and Linfen for over a month. The training content focused on cultivation, seed selection, fertilization, and pest control. Each training area focused on education based on local climate and crop differences, combined with practical situations and mass demands. For example, Xingxian District emphasized livestock epidemic prevention; Linfen and Yicheng Districts focused on the cultivation methods of Sizi cotton and Jinzi cotton. In addition, each district linked the training to past production experiences, studying various policies and methods for leading, organizing, and rewarding production.

    The training classes adopted a teaching method that combined lectures and experiments. To facilitate understanding and memory for the trainees, some scientific terms were translated into local vernacular. Taiyuan and Changzhi Districts also created various specimens and used microscopes and various instruments for teaching. The teaching process was divided into stages; after finishing one subject, another was taught, with timely summaries to facilitate memory for the workers and peasant cadres. At the same time, ideological education was integrated into the teaching to make the trainees understand the importance of learning technology and correct their learning attitudes. In Taiyuan and Changzhi Districts, each study group was equipped with a study tutor to supplement the professors' deficiencies. In addition, timely tests, commendations, and criticisms were held to motivate trainees to teach and learn from each other and to launch learning competitions, which boosted the trainees' learning enthusiasm. The trainees engaged in enthusiastic discussions, answering and questioning each other, seizing every opportunity to learn, and creating a high tide of learning.

    Through this training, the trainees first further believed in the importance of science and technology for improving production in their thinking, and began to change their previous backward superstitious ideas and conservative empiricism. For example, trainees in Changzhi and Taiyuan Districts personally saw germs under the microscope, understood the causes of wheat smut and jaundice, mastered the warm water seed soaking method and the scientific theoretical basis for preventing crops from getting sick, and then learned pest control methods. In terms of cultivation, they learned about different crop types and different soil types. Most trainees reflected: "We learned a lot of skills this time." Zhang Genxin from Xin County said: "I used to think that wheat jaundice and black jaundice were just natural occurrences. After learning, I realized that they are caused by germ infection. I remember the benefits of warm water seed soaking even more clearly." Some county agricultural staff members said: "In the past, technical guidance had old-fashioned problems; this time, I learned a lot of new things that can replace it." The trainees' performance was generally very good; in the Taiyuan training class, only five out of 216 trainees failed the test. In addition, trainees from various places also exchanged rich practical experiences. For example, trainees from Xin County introduced the wheat from Baijiashan in the Third District, which has never suffered from jaundice and matures early. Cadres from Fenyang introduced: "Mixing seeds with asphalt can kill insects, act as fertilizer, and resist drought."

    At the end of the training, each trainee developed a work plan for after returning, to carry out publicity before spring plowing in conjunction with Spring Festival activities and winter studies, and to hold small-scale seminars. They prepared to tell the masses what they had learned this time. In order to enable the trainees who have completed the training class to popularize the technology they have learned to the masses, Yuci Prefecture in this province specifically instructed all counties under its jurisdiction on the 25th of last month to hold short-term training classes with cadres trained in the province as the core, to train a large number of key members in agricultural production. The Shanxi Provincial Department of Agriculture attaches great importance to this method of Yuci Prefecture, believing that it will have a great effect on this year's major production campaign. It has specifically notified all prefectures and counties of its plan and methods to attract the attention of all localities to the work of training agricultural cadres.

    山西五百农业干部受训完毕  榆次专区将普遍开办训练班
    【本报讯】山西消息：山西省农业厅分五区举办的全省农业干部技术训练班第一期学员已于上月中旬先后结业。
    山西省第一期农业干部技术训练班学员五百八十二人（其中有专署农业科员和县农业科长四人，县农业科员九十四人，区农业助理员三百十九人，村干部及劳动英雄一百六十五人），分在太原市、长治、翼城、兴县、临汾五处进行训练，历时月余。训练内容以耕作、选种、施肥、防除病虫害为主。各训练区根据当地气候与作物的不同，结合实际情况与群众要求，有重点地进行教育。如兴县区着重家畜防疫；临汾、翼城区以斯字棉、金字棉的栽培法为主。此外，各区都联系了历年来的生产经验，学习了领导、组织和奖励生产的各种政策与方法。
    训练班采取了讲授与实验并用的教学方法。为了便于学员的了解与记忆，将一些科学名词变为群众土语。太原、长治区还制了各种标本，并利用显微镜和各种仪器教学。教学进程是分段进行，结束一门功课后再教另一门，并及时进行总结，以便于工农干部的记忆。同时，教学中贯彻了思想教育，使学员明了学习技术的重要，端正其学习态度。太原、长治区在训练中，每一学习小组均配备了学习辅导员，以补助教授之不足。此外，及时举行测验与表扬批评，发动学员互教互学，展开学习竞赛，鼓舞了学员的学习情绪，学员们讨论热烈，互相答问质疑，随时随地抓紧学习，造成了学习的高潮。
    经过此次训练，学员们首先在思想上进一步相信了科学技术对于提高生产的重要，开始转变了已往落后的迷信思想和保守的经验主义。如长治、太原两区学员在显微镜中亲眼看到了病菌，了解了黑穗病和黄疸的原因，掌握了温汤浸种办法与使作物不生病的科学理论根据，进而学会了病虫害的防治法。在耕作上，知道了不同的作物种类和不同的土壤等知识。大部学员反映：“这次学的本事很多。”忻县张根新说：“麦子黄疸和黑疸，我过去只认为是天年。经过学习，才明白了是有病菌传染的。温汤浸种的好处我更记得清楚了。”有的县农业科员表示：“过去技术指导存在着老一套的毛病；这回学了好多新东西，能代替它了。”学员的成绩一般很好，太原训练班二百一十六人，只有五个学员测验不及格。此外，各地学员并交流了丰富的实际经验。如忻县学员介绍三区白家山的麦子，历年来不生黄疸病，而且成熟期早。汾阳干部介绍：“用柏油拌种既能杀虫，又可顶肥料和抗旱。”
    在训练结束时，每个学员都订出了回去以后的工作计划，要在春耕以前结合春节活动和冬学开展宣传，召开小型座谈会等。准备把这次学得的东西告诉给广大群众。该省榆次专署为使训练班结业学员能把他们所学的技术普及到群众中去，特于上月二十五日指示所属各县，以在省受训干部为核心举办短期训练班，大批训练农业生产中的骨干分子。榆次专署此项办法，该省农业厅极为重视，认为对今年大生产运动有很大作用。特将其计划与办法通报各专县，以引起各地对训练农业干部工作的注意。
