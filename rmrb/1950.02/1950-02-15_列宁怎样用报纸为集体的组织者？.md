How Did Lenin Use Newspapers as a Collective Organizer?
　　Li Shu

　　I.

　　Before the October Revolution, Lenin used newspapers as a primary tool to create the Party and lead the revolution. From *Iskra* (The Spark), *Vpered* (Forward), *Proletary* (The Proletarian), *Novaya Zhizn* (New Life), to *Pravda* (Truth), newspapers were always the most powerful weapon in Lenin's hands. After the October Revolution, newspapers remained an important tool for the CPSU in building the Party and the state.

　　"A newspaper is not only a collective propagandist and a collective agitator, but also a collective organizer." This is a brilliant journalistic theory that runs through Lenin's works. According to Lenin's plan, publishing a newspaper was the first practical step in establishing a working-class party in Russia, starting with a central political newspaper. Because around 1900, many small Marxist groups and organizations already existed in Russia, with their own activities and local newspapers, they lacked a unified organization. The characteristics of Party life at that time were a handicraft approach, small-group mentality, and ideological separation. Lenin firmly opposed this disunity, demanding the establishment of a unified Social Democratic Party, but also opposed achieving this goal by convening the Second Congress of the Russian Social Democratic Labor Party. He believed that such unity "cannot be achieved based on a mere resolution of some representative meeting." He advocated founding a central political newspaper to openly and comprehensively discuss the fundamental issues of principle and strategy raised by the modern "Economists," "Bernsteinians," and "Critics." Lenin said: "Before uniting, and in order to unite, we must first resolutely and clearly draw a line of demarcation." Lenin pointed out that only in this way could ideological and organizational conditions be created for a unified Social Democratic Party.

　　Lenin demanded that local organizations first devote their efforts to participating in the common cause, caring about the central newspaper, and working for the central newspaper. Only with the comprehensive materials provided by the central newspaper could local work become richer and more complete. He condemned the state of disunity in which local publications predominated over central publications. In *What Is to Be Done?*, Lenin wrote: "The predominance of local newspapers over the central newspaper is either a sign of poverty or a sign of luxury. It is a sign of poverty when the movement has not yet created sufficient forces to engage in large-scale production, when the movement is still confined to a handicraft approach and almost immersed in 'the petty details of factory life.' It would be a sign of luxury when the movement is fully capable of performing the tasks of comprehensive exposure and comprehensive agitation, and therefore needs many local newspapers in addition to the central organ. Let everyone judge for himself what our current predominance of local newspapers proves. ... Most of our local organizations have so far thought almost exclusively of local newspapers, and have been actively working almost exclusively for local newspapers. This is an abnormal situation. In fact, it should be exactly the opposite: most local organizers should first care about the all-Russian newspaper, and first work for the all-Russian newspaper. Until this is achieved, we will not be able to run a newspaper that can help the movement with comprehensive agitation in its publications. And when this has been achieved, the normal relationship between the necessary central organ and the necessary local newspapers will naturally be established."

　　II.

　　Lenin believed that the newspaper as a collective organizer could be compared to scaffolding used to build a house. "It outlines the structure of the building, facilitates communication between the builders, helps them allocate work, and examines the overall achievements of organized labor. With the help and connection of the newspaper, a regular organization can naturally be formed; this organization will not only do local work, but also do regular general work, to teach its members to carefully examine political events, assess the significance and impact of these events on all classes of people, and determine appropriate ways for the revolutionary party to influence these events."

　　This regular organization was the network of agents conducting newspaper sales. These agents were selected professional revolutionaries, not people who only engaged in revolution in their spare evenings. They would be the backbone of the Party organization. The national network of agents and correspondents composed of them was linked to the newspaper and to each other, carrying out their work in various parts of the country with a strict and meticulous division of labor.

　　*Iskra*, published in Munich on December 11, 1900, operated according to Lenin's plan.

　　Lenin not only published his brilliant essays in *Iskra*, but also diligently and carefully led the agent network of *Iskra*. The selfless *Iskra* agents used various methods to transport the newspaper across borders, spread it to the working masses throughout Russia at the risk of the high pressure of the police, and united the local committees around *Iskra*. Once they were cracked down upon, they would be exiled, imprisoned, or sentenced to prison. Lenin attached great importance to their work and personally presided over the correspondence between *Iskra* and the local agents and various organizations within Russia. He tried his best to ensure constant contact with Russian organizations and carefully observed every step of *Iskra*'s members. He often could not sleep at night when he received news about the arrest of a staff member, the crackdown on a committee or a publication transfer, or the loss of contact with an organization. He carefully talked with comrades who came abroad, inquiring about the work of local organizations. Krupskaya, who went abroad in 1901 to serve as the secretary of the *Iskra* editorial department, recalled: "We knew very well what each *Iskra* agent was doing, and we discussed all their work with them; when the connection between them was broken, we connected them with each other, notified them about the news of being cracked down, etc."

　　Through the efforts of *Iskra* agents, *Iskra* widely aroused the attention of Marxist groups and the working class throughout Russia. Around the ideas of *Iskra*, and around *Iskra* itself, the vast majority of local organizations gradually united, and *Iskra* took over local organizations one by one from the Economists. In this way, *Iskra* became not only the ideological struggle center of the working class's socialism, but also the actual and organizational center of the Social Democratic Party.

　　*Iskra*'s struggle for Lenin's organizational plan was successful. On July 30, 1903, one and a half years after the publication of *Iskra*, the Second Congress of the Russian Social Democratic Labor Party was held in Brussels (later moved to London). The preparatory work for the congress in the country was mainly the responsibility of the *Iskra* agents. Relying on Lenin's leadership, they completed their task for the first time on the scaffolding.

　　III.

　　*Pravda*, published in Petrograd on May 5, 1912, was founded entirely according to Lenin's design, under the leadership of Stalin. Stalin pointed out that *Pravda* was truly the result of the efforts of the Russian working class, especially the Petrograd working class. *Pravda*'s publishing funds were raised from the workers, and the workers used their own strength to create the necessary technical and material conditions for *Pravda*.

　　From the city of Krakow, not far from the border, Lenin constantly wrote articles for *Pravda* and watched *Pravda*'s work every day. He demanded that *Pravda* be sent to him on time. Even a few hours' delay made him anxious. In a letter to the editorial department, he said: "*Pravda* is always half a day later than the bourgeois newspapers. Can't this situation be changed so that it can be sent regularly on time, so that it can arrive at the same time as the bourgeois newspapers?"

　　At that time, *Pravda* was often suppressed by the Tsarist police and forced to pay fines, and each fine relied on workers' donations. Lenin attached great importance to this fact. He repeatedly examined which workers' organizations donated to *Pravda*. Because such donations could not only allow *Pravda* to continue to exist, but also had great organizational significance. In her memoirs of Lenin, Krupskaya said that Lenin even planned a special form of donation called "A Worker Kopeck." According to this plan, all workers who sympathized with *Pravda* would donate one kopeck on the day they received their wages. The number of kopecks would show how many workers sympathized with *Pravda*. Only because the Russian trade unions and Party organizations were still relatively weak in 1912, this plan was not realized. However, the workers' donations of one kopeck at a time were still very enthusiastic. When *Pravda* was published for two years, Lenin pointed out with great excitement that nearly six thousand workers' groups had raised donations for *Pravda* in two years. He said that this proved that *Pravda* was supported by the workers themselves, while the funds for the Menshevik newspapers mainly came from intellectuals and the liberal bourgeoisie.

　　Lenin paid special attention to the distribution of *Pravda* among the workers. He once asked *Pravda* for a complete list of subscribers, carefully calculated the number of worker subscribers, analyzed the distribution of worker subscribers, and found out where, in which factories, in which cities, and in which worker villages, there were the most subscribers, etc. In the article "*On Communist Publications in the Transition Period*" in *Pravda* on February 7, 1921, Lenin expressed great indignation at the incorrect distribution of newspapers, because the newspapers were not distributed to the masses, but remained in the hands of various Soviet-era bureaucrats. He suggested paying full attention to the posting of newspapers, first providing newspapers for posting in workers' and peasants' reading rooms and libraries, so that the newspapers could be widely spread to the working and peasant masses.

　　IV.

　　Lenin established a very serious and conscientious Bolshevik style in editorial work, and at the same time embodied the role of the newspaper as a collective organizer.

　　Lenin handled each issue of *Iskra*'s manuscripts with all his enthusiasm and consistent thoroughness. The content of the newspaper and individual articles were discussed at editorial meetings. Every sentence and every word was carefully considered. This was Lenin's characteristic: he delved into every detail of the work. He wanted to personally correct the proofs, although this work could be entrusted to other comrades, he was still afraid that there would be slight typos, shortcomings, or oversights in the newspaper. Krupskaya said that Lenin always proofread it himself first, then handed it to her, and then he would personally review it again. Lenin tried his best to absorb worker authors to write newsletters and essays for *Iskra*. Before he prepared to go abroad to found *Iskra*, Lenin agreed with Babushkin, a metal worker near Nevskaya, to write newsletters for *Iskra*, and solicited worker correspondents. When *Iskra* was about to be published, he wrote to Nogen, a dyer who was preparing to return to Russia in London, asking him to maintain close contact with *Iskra*, organize a correspondence group, and transmit news to *Iskra*. All other *Iskra* agents also shouldered the same task. Lenin was very concerned about revising worker correspondence. He asked to preserve the spirit, style, and characteristics of the original work, so that they would not lose their original color and become overly intellectualized. Lenin was very angry because the local staff revised the worker correspondence beyond recognition before sending it back. He insisted on establishing direct contact with the workers.

　　Lenin was very good at organizing the writing work of newspapers. He once gathered a large number of Party writing talents around *Pravda*, including the famous writer Gorky. At the same time, Lenin paid great attention to the composition of the writers, and repeatedly concerned himself with calculating the number of worker correspondents in *Pravda*. In this respect, Lenin and Plekhanov were so different. Plekhanov was an extreme individualist, always thinking that he was the editorial department, and the editorial department was him. But Lenin was a collectivist. On the one hand, he had a high sense of responsibility for editorial work, and on the other hand, he could fully use the strength of the editorial staff and obtain everything they could give. Lenin demanded principled firmness from experienced political activists, but adopted a different, attentive, and caring attitude towards young, novice writers, giving them many instructions to correct their mistakes. If a young author made principled errors due to lack of experience or being obsessed with something, but was able to learn, Lenin would spare no time to help him. When his article was not revised to meet the requirements, Lenin was determined to revise it not only once, but two or three times.

　　Krupskaya had a very vivid description of Lenin's ability to organize writing. She said: "For example, to explain a new topic. At the beginning, no one expressed willingness to write. So Ilyich talked to the person he thought was most suitable for writing on this issue, and started to promote him. He did not immediately ask him to write about this issue, but first talked to him about the issues involved in this topic, aroused his interest in this issue, and then led him in a certain direction to see what the other party said. Sometimes, when the matter reached a deadlock and could not progress, Ilyich would find someone else and start talking to him again. When he saw that the other party was 'hooked,' he would discuss the issue in more detail. Based on the answers and dialogues, he could see how the other party would discuss the issue, and then he would describe his own opinions to the other party in detail and elaborate on his own views in more detail. Then he suggested—'You should write about this issue, you will write well.' So this person, who was induced by Ilyich's humble attitude, agreed, and the narrative often simply reflected Lenin's opinions."

　　Make the newspaper the center of the Party's ideological and political leadership, unite and organize the entire Party around it; organize newspaper sales, make the newspaper's agents the backbone of the Party organization; organize newspaper supporters and readers among the workers, so that the newspaper can be widely spread to the working and peasant masses; finally, organize worker correspondents, organize writing talents to write articles, and rely on collective strength to run the newspaper well. In this way, Lenin implemented his doctrine that "the newspaper is not only a collective propagandist and a collective agitator, but also a collective organizer" in all aspects, and established the excellent tradition of Bolshevik newspapers.

　　列宁怎样用报纸为集体的组织者？
    黎澍
    一
    在十月革命以前，列宁是以报纸作为一个主要工具来创造党和领导革命的。从《火星》报、《前进》报、《无产者》报、《新生活》报以至《真理》报，报纸始终是掌握在列宁手中的最有力的武器。十月革命以后，报纸仍然是联共建设党和国家的重要工具。
    “报纸不仅是集体的宣传者和集体的鼓动者，而且是集体的组织者”。这是贯串在列宁著作中的灿烂的新闻学说。按照列宁的计划，出版报纸是在俄国建立工人阶级政党的第一个实际步骤，而首先是出版中央政治报。因为在一九○○年前后，俄国早已存在着许多细小的马克思主义团体和组织，它们有自己的活动，有自己的地方报纸，但是它们缺乏一个统一的组织，手工业方式、小组习气与思想上的分离是当时党内生活的特征。列宁坚决反对这种涣散状态，要求建立统一的社会民主党，然而也反对以召开俄国社会民主党第二次代表大会来达到这个目的。他认为这种统一“是不能根据什么代表会议的一纸决议来达到的”。他主张创办中央政治报，公开地和各方面地来讨论现代“经济派”，“培恩斯坦派”和“批评家”所提出的原则上和策略上的基本问题。列宁说：“在统一以前，并为统一起见，首先必须坚决而明确地划清界限”。列宁指出，只有这样，才能为统一的社会民主党创造思想上和组织上的条件。
    列宁要求地方组织首先应当拿出力量来参加共同事业，关怀中央报纸，为中央报纸工作。只有有了中央报纸供给的全面的材料，地方工作才会更丰富更完备起来。他痛责地方刊物比中央刊物占优势的涣散状态。在“做什么”一书中，列宁写道：“地方刊物比中央刊物占优势，这不是贫乏的表现，便是奢华的表现。当运动还没有创造出充分力量来从事大生产时，当运动还拘泥于手工业方式，差不多还沉溺在‘工厂生活琐事’中间的时候，就是贫乏的表现。而当运动已完全能执行各方面揭露工作和各方面鼓动工作的任务，因而除掉中央机关报之外，还需要有许多地方机关报的时候，就会是奢华的表现。现时我们地方报占优势，究竟是证明什么，让每个人自己去判断吧。……我们的大多数地方组织，至今都几乎只想到地方机关报，几乎是专为地方机关报而积极工作。这是不正常的情形。其实是应当恰巧相反：大多数地方组织者首先应关怀全俄报纸，首先应为全俄报纸工作。在没有做到这点以前，我们就办不成一个多少能够用刊物上的全面鼓动来帮助运动的报纸。而当这一点已做到时，必要的中央机关报与必要的地方机关报间的正常关系，就会自然建立起来了”。
    二
    列宁认为报纸之为集体的组织者，可以譬喻为建筑房屋用的建筑架。“它指出建筑物的轮廓，便利各建筑匠间的联络，帮助他们分配工作并考察有组织的劳动所达到的总成绩。在报纸的帮助和联系之下，自然可以形成经常的组织；这个组织不仅要做地方的工作，而且要做经常的一般的工作，来教导自己的组员留心考察政治事件，估计这些事件对于各人民阶层的意义和影响，规定革命党影响这些事件的妥当办法”。
    这个经常的组织就是进行报纸推销工作的代办员网。这种代办员是经过选择的职业革命家，而不是只在空暇的晚上才干革命的人，他们将是党组织的骨干。由他们所构成的全国代办员以及通讯员网，既与报纸联系着，又互相联系着，以严格而细密的分工，在全国各地进行自己的工作。
    一九○○年十二月十一日在慕尼黑出版的《火星》报，就是按照列宁这个计划进行工作的。
    列宁不只是在《火星》报发表他的辉煌的论文，而且殷勤仔细地领导着《火星》报的代办员网。奋不顾身的《火星》报代办员用各种方法把报纸运过国界，在俄国境内各地冒着警察的高压散布到工人群众中去，并把各地方委员会团结在《火星》报周围。他们一遭破获，就得被流放、监禁或判处徒刑。列宁异常重视他们的工作，亲自主持《火星》报与各地代办员以及俄国境内各个组织间的通讯。他竭力保证与俄国各组织间有经常不断的联系，仔细地观察《火星》分子的每一步活动。他收到关于某一工作人员被捕，关于某个委员会或某次刊物转运遭受破获，关于丧失与某个组织间的联系的消息，往往通宵不能安睡。他细心地和那些来到国外的同志谈话，询问地方组织的工作情况。一九○一年到国外担任《火星》报编辑部秘书的克鲁普斯卡亚回忆说：“我们曾经很详细地知道每一个《火星》代办员所作的事情，曾经和他们讨论他们的全部工作；当他们中间的联系断绝时，我们就把他们彼此联系起来，把关于遭受破获的消息通知他们等等”。
    经过《火星》报代办员的努力，《火星》报在俄国境内广泛地引起了各地马克思主义团体和工人阶级的注意。在《火星》报思想的周围，在《火星》报本身的周围，逐渐团结起了绝大多数的地方组织，《火星》报把地方组织一个一个地从经济派手里夺了过来。这样，《火星》报就不仅成了工人阶级社会主义思想上的斗争中心，而且成了实际上与组织上的社会民主党的中心。
    《火星》报为列宁组织计划的奋斗是成功的。一九○三年七月三十日，即《火星》报出版一年半以后，在布鲁塞尔举行了俄国社会民主工党第二次代表大会（后来移往伦敦开会）。大会在国内的筹备工作主要地是由《火星》报代办员负责的。依靠列宁的领导，他们首次在建筑架上完成了任务。
    三
    一九一二年五月五日在彼得堡出版的《真理》报是完全按照列宁的图样，在斯大林主持下创办的。斯大林指出，《真理》报真正是俄国工人阶级，特别是彼得堡工人阶级努力的结果。《真理》报的出版经费是从工人中募集起来的，工人用自己的力量创造了《真理》报的必要的技术与物质的条件。
    列宁从距国境不远的克拉科夫城不断地给《真理》报写稿，每天每天地注视着《真理》报的工作。他要求《真理》报准时寄给他，甚至几小时的迟误都使他焦虑不安，他在写给编辑部的信上说：“《真理》报总是比各资产阶级报纸迟到半日。难道不可以改变这种情形而经常按时寄送，使它能与各资产阶级报纸同时寄到么”？
    《真理》报在当时经常遭受着沙皇警察的取缔，被迫缴付罚款，而每一次罚款都是依靠工人捐助的。列宁非常重视这个事实。他再三考察究竟是那些工人组织给《真理》报捐款。因为这种捐款不仅能使《真理》报继续存在，而且具有极大的组织意义。克鲁普斯卡亚在她回忆列宁的著作中说，列宁甚至还计划过一种特别的捐款形式，名为“一个工人哥比”。按照这个计划，凡是同情《真理》报的工人，在领得工资的那一天都捐出一个哥比。看哥比的数目就可以知道有多少工人是同情《真理》报的。仅仅由于一九一二年这一时期俄国职工会和党组织还比较薄弱，所以这个计划未能实现。然而工人一个哥比一个哥比的捐款还是非常踊跃的。当《真理》报出版两年的时候，列宁非常兴奋地指出，在两年之内，将近有六千个工人团体替《真理》报募捐。他说，这证明《真理》报是由工人们自己支持的，而孟塞维克报纸的经费主要是从知识分子与自由资产阶级那里得来的。
    列宁特别注意《真理》报在工人中发行的情况。他曾经向《真理》报索取全部定户名册，细心地计算工人定户的数目，分析工人定户分布的情况，查明在什么地方，在什么工厂，在什么城市和什么工人村落定户最多等等。列宁在一九二一年二月七日《真理》报《论过渡时期的共产主义刊物》一文中，对报纸的不正确的分配表示非常愤慨，因为报纸没有发行到群众中去，而停留在各种苏维埃时代的官僚手里。他建议要充分注意报纸的张贴工作，首先要供给工人农民阅览室和图书馆张贴用的报纸，使报纸能广泛地传布到工农群众中去。
    四
    列宁在编辑工作上，建立了十分严肃认真的布尔塞维克的作风，也同时体现了报纸之为集体的组织者的作用。
    《火星》报每一期的稿件，列宁都是用他的全部热情和一贯的彻底性去处理的。报纸内容以及个别的文章都要在编辑部会议上讨论过。每一句话，每一个字都过细加以推敲。这是列宁的特性，他深入工作的每一个细节。他要亲自改正校样，虽然这个工作大可以委托其他同志去作，但他仍旧怕报纸上会要出现些微的错字、缺点或疏忽的地方。克鲁普斯卡亚说，总是首先由列宁亲自校阅一遍，然后交给她，以后他还要亲自审查一遍。列宁竭力吸收工人作者为《火星》报写作通讯和论文。在他准备出国创办《火星》报之前，列宁就和涅瓦卡附近的五金工人巴布石金约好，要他给《火星》写通讯，并征求工人通讯作者。在《火星》报快要出版时候，又写信给当时在伦敦准备回俄国去的染匠诺根，要他务必与《火星》保持密切的联系，组织通讯小组，给《火星》报传递消息。其他所有《火星》报代办员也都担负着同样的任务。列宁非常关心修改工人通讯的工作。他要求保存原作的精神、体裁和特点，使它们不致失掉本来的彩色、过分地知识分子化。曾经因为各地方的工作人员把工人通讯改得面目全非再行寄来，使得列宁非常生气，他坚持要与工人建立直接的联系。
    列宁非常善于组织报纸的写稿工作。他曾经把党内著作人才大量收集在《真理》报周围，包括著名作家高尔基。列宁同时又十分注意撰稿人的成分，屡次关心地计算着《真理》报工人通讯员的数目。在这一点上，列宁和普列汉诺夫是如此之不同。普列汉诺夫是个极端的个人主义者，总是以为他就是编辑部，编辑部就是他。而列宁则是集体主义者。一方面他有着对编辑工作的高度的责任心，一方面他能充分运用编辑人员的力量，取得他们所能给予的一切。列宁对有经验的政治活动家要求原则上的坚定性，而对年青的、初学写的作者却采取另一种注意的、关怀的态度，给他们许多改正错误的指示。一个年青的作者因缺乏经验，或因沉醉于什么而甚至犯了原则性错误，但能够学习，列宁就不惜任何时间帮助他。当他的文章没有修改到合乎要求的时候，列宁就决心不只一次地，而是两次三次地来修改它。
    克鲁普斯卡亚对于列宁之善于组织写稿，有过一段非常生动的描写。她说：“例如，要阐明某个新的主题。开始谁也没有表示愿意写作。于是依里奇就找他认为是最适于写作这一问题的文章的人谈话，开始宣传他。并不立刻提出要写关于这个问题的文章，而首先来同他谈到这主题中所涉及的问题，引起对于这个问题的兴趣，然后又把他引到一定的方向上去，看对方说什么。有时事成僵局再也不能进展时，那依里奇就另找旁人，又开始同他谈话。当看到对方‘上钩’时，他就更详详细细地来讨论问题。他根据回答和对话就能看出对方将怎样论述问题，那时他就向对方详细地叙述自己的意见，更详细地发挥自己的观点。然后他提议——‘你来写写这个问题罢，你是会写得好的’。于是这位被依里奇的谦诚态度所诱导的人就答应了，而且叙述出来常常简直就是列宁的意见”。
    使报纸成为党在思想上、政治上领导的中心，使全党环绕着它团结起来，组织起来；组织报纸的推销工作，使报纸的代办员成为党组织的骨干；在工人中组织报纸的支持者和读者，使报纸广泛地传布到工农群众中去；最后，组织工人通讯员，组织著作人才写稿，依靠集体的力量来办好报纸。就是这样，列宁在各方面贯彻了他“报纸不仅是集体的宣传者和集体的鼓动者，而且是集体的组织者”的学说，建立了布尔塞维克报纸的优良的传统。
