　　Northeast Bank Shenyang Branch
    Handles Settlement and Credit Business
    Wasteful Practices of Enterprises Will Be Gradually Corrected
    [This Newspaper's Dispatch] In order to implement the new business guidelines for 1950 and the instructions of the head office, strengthen economic accounting, and accelerate the turnover rate of funds, the Northeast Bank Shenyang Branch has preliminarily determined to establish settlement and credit relationships with relevant enterprise departments starting from the 11th of this month. In the three days between the 11th and the 13th of this month, the bank approved short-term loans and transferred funds to various enterprises, including six enterprise departments: the Ministry of Industry, the Mechanical Administration Bureau, the Northeast Department Store Corporation, the Non-Ferrous Metals Administration Bureau, the Textile Administration Bureau, and the Northeast Fuel Corporation. Among them, the Northeast Department Store Corporation's purchase of kerosene and allocation of materials accounted for the largest amount, accounting for one-half of the total transfer amount. The implementation of banks themselves acting as settlement and credit institutions for enterprises will avoid mixing long-term national investment and short-term bank turnover in the future. It can also avoid the confusion between enterprises' capital construction funds and enterprises' production funds, as well as enterprises' payment of taxes and profits to the state. This ensures that transactions between enterprises are settled through the bank at the time and place, so that every transaction can be clarified immediately, correcting the past drawbacks of many unclear payments. At the same time, due to the supervisory role of the bank, the wasteful use of funds by some enterprises in the past can also be gradually corrected.

　　东北银行沈阳分行
    办理结算信贷业务
    今后各企业的浪费现象将逐步纠正
    【本报讯】东北银行沈阳分行为执行一九五○年新的业务方针及总行指示，加强经济核算，加速资金周转率，自本月十一日起，初步确定与有关各企业部门建立结算、信贷关系后，至本月十三日三天中间，经过该行准许短期贷款，给各企业转账者，计有工业部、机械管理局、东北百货总公司、有色金属管理局、纺织管理局、东北燃料总公司等六个企业部门。其中以东北百货总公司购买火油及拨付物资处的金额为最多，占转账总数的二分之一。各企业以银行本身作为结算、信贷机关的实施，将避免今后国家长期投资和银行的短期周转混在一起，也可避免各企业的基本建设资金和企业的生产资金以及企业本身缴纳国家的税款、利润混淆不清等现象。使得企业与企业之间的交易，在当时当地经过银行的结算，能够每一笔账都即时搞清；改正了过去许多款项纠缠不清的弊病。同时由于银行的监督作用，过去有些企业的浪费资金现象，亦可逐步纠正。
