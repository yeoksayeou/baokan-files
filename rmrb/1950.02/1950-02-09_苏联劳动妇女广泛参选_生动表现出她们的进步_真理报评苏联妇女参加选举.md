　　Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 3rd (TASS dispatch): *People's Daily* recently published an article commenting on Soviet women's participation in the election movement, stating: The upcoming election of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union will vividly demonstrate the progress of Soviet women in political and cultural fields, as well as their social activities and high level of socialist consciousness.

　　The commentary stated: The party of Lenin and Stalin has enabled Soviet working women to show their talents in the vibrant fields of social and political activity. The Soviet state has 277 outstanding women who are representatives of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, and more than 1,700 are representatives of the Supreme Soviets of the various union republics and autonomous republics. Nearly 500,000 women have been elected to local Soviets of Workers' Deputies. Soviet women widely enjoy their rights to work and receive education, and have become a huge force in the economic and cultural construction of the Soviet Union. Women account for 44 percent of all university-educated professionals. Approximately 300,000 women are engineers and foremen. Millions of female workers have mastered complex industrial skills. In the Soviet countryside, many women skillfully manage the publicly owned economy of collective farms and are the most advanced elements in improving Soviet agriculture and animal husbandry.

　　*People's Daily* further pointed out: The Soviet example shows that the inequality and enslaved status of women can only be abolished on the basis of eliminating capitalism. Currently, an increasingly broad mass of working women has come to realize that they are participating in the international democratic front that is fighting for peace and against the instigators of a new war.

    真理报评苏联妇女参加选举
    【新华社讯】塔斯社莫斯科三日电：真理报顷著文评论苏联妇女参加选举运动称：即将举行的苏联最高苏维埃选举，将生动地表现出苏联妇女在政治与文化方面的进步，和她们的社会活动及高度的社会主义自觉。
    评论称：列宁与斯大林的党，已使苏联劳动妇女在生气勃勃的社会与政治活动领域内，显露头角。苏维埃国家有最先进的妇女二百七十七人，是苏联最高苏维埃的代表，有一千七百多人是各加盟共和国与自治共和国最高苏维埃的代表，几近五十万妇女被选入地方劳动者代表苏维埃。苏联妇女广泛地享用她们的工作权与受教育权，而成为苏联经济与文化建设中的巨大力量。在全体受过大学教育的专门人材中，妇女占百分之四十四。约有三十万妇女是工程师与领班。数百万女工已掌握了复杂的工业技艺。在苏联农村中，有许多妇女能干地经营着集体农场的公有经济，并且在提高苏联农业及牧畜业上是最先进的分子。
    真理报进一步指出：苏联的范例表明：妇女之遭受不平等及其奴隶式的地位，只有在消灭资本主义的基础上才能废除。目前，越来越广大的劳动妇女群众，已了解到她们参加了为和平、反对新战争挑拨者而斗争的国际民主阵线。
