At the meeting, Chairman Peng Dehuai spoke twice, emphasizing that the work of eliminating secret agents and bandits must rely on the masses and mobilize the masses.

During the discussion of the production and disaster relief instructions, the members put forward many specific and constructive opinions. Vice Chairman Xi Zhongxun emphasized: "Disaster relief should be the central task of the Northwest Military and Political Committee and all departments at present.
