Visiting the Vietnamese Women's Delegation
　　Bai Sheng

　　At the National Democratic Women's Federation, we met the Vietnamese women's delegation that recently arrived in Beijing after a long journey from Vietnam. The head of the delegation, Nguyen Khoa Dieu Hong, and representatives Phan An and Hoang Thi Be were all members of the National Committee of the Vietnamese Women's Union. Hoang Thi Be is also the editor-in-chief of the Vietnamese Women's Monthly, sponsored by the Vietnamese National Women's Union. Another representative, Le Ton Phuong, is a member of the Women's Union Committee in a certain war zone in Vietnam. We excitedly discussed the recent establishment of diplomatic relations between China and Vietnam.

　　The establishment of diplomatic relations between China and Vietnam is not only a development of the deep friendship between the Chinese and Vietnamese people, but also a great encouragement to the liberation movements of all oppressed nations in Asia. Nguyen Khoa Dieu Hong told us that the entire Vietnamese people are watching everything in the new China with the utmost concern. They were infinitely delighted by the major event of China's first formal establishment of diplomatic relations with Vietnam, and she believed that all the Vietnamese people shared the same sentiments as them. She said that this showed that Vietnam had a friend to be most proud of. This close friendship would make the imperialists tremble and further consolidate the world peace and democracy camp.

　　We talked about the recent incidents of French troops persecuting overseas Chinese in Vietnam. Most of the overseas Chinese residing in Vietnam are farmers, followed by merchants. They are as close as brothers to the local Vietnamese people, but they also suffer the cruel oppression of French imperialism. One of the most inhumane atrocities occurred on the night of November 19th last year, when more than a hundred French armed forces surrounded the Qingling and Liugang farms in Yong'an province, brutally plundering and destroying our overseas Chinese men and women. The overseas Chinese have sent telegrams back home requesting support for this atrocity, which has also aroused anger and sympathy among the Vietnamese people.

　　Our topic gradually focused on the struggle of Vietnamese women. Nguyen Khoa Dieu Hong told us many stories about the heroic struggles of Vietnamese women.

　　Under French rule, Vietnamese women lived under the oppression of the feudal system. Since the August Revolution in 1945, Vietnamese women have had equal rights with men. The Vietnamese National Democratic Women's Federation already has two million members, including democratic women from all walks of life in Vietnam. The Democratic Women's Federation has also expanded to enemy-occupied areas.

　　The four years of national liberation war have tempered Vietnamese women. They bravely participated in the liberation war. Many women have joined the national army or guerrillas. In southern Vietnam, there is an outstanding female commander, Ho Thi Bi, and in Guangzhi province, there is a famous female guerrilla fighter, Tran Thi Ou, both of whom have participated in dozens of battles. In the north, a woman named Nguyen Thi A fought a transportation war against the enemy on Highway 5 and was awarded the first medal by Vo Nguyen Giap, Commander-in-Chief of the Vietnamese National Army. In various posts such as factories, farms, workshops, schools, and hospitals, Vietnamese women are working selflessly, participating in production and supporting the front. After Vietnam launched the patriotic competition movement in 1948, women showed great patriotic enthusiasm. In Bac Giang province in northern Vietnam, a female worker named Nguyen Thi Trac from the National Defense Paper Mill won first place in the national patriotic production competition.

　　Speaking of the Vietnamese people's struggle against French imperialism and its puppet Bao Dai, Nguyen Khoa Dieu Hong smiled with a sarcastic tone and said: Bao Dai is just a useless dog with its tail between its legs, following French imperialism downhill. This spring, the Vietnamese People's Liberation Army will launch a general offensive on a wide front to finally wipe out these French colonial elements and their lackeys. In the past four years of national liberation war, the Vietnamese people, under the leadership of the Vietnam Democratic League, have learned from the revolutionary struggle experiences of the Soviet and Chinese people, organized a broad people's democratic united front, and established a strong people's national defense army, which has become a guarantee for the victory of the Vietnamese national liberation struggle.

　　Nguyen Khoa Dieu Hong also told us about the general situation in Vietnam. Under the rule of French imperialism, Vietnam, which had never had any industrial construction, has gradually developed its industry since the August Revolution, especially the textile industry, the leather industry, and the paper-making industry. At the same time, due to the needs of the war, Vietnam also has its own national defense industry. Many mobile arsenals have been established in various provinces of Vietnam to manufacture mines, grenades, etc. In terms of agricultural production, although it has been constantly damaged by French imperialism, the active production of farmers has provided a strong guarantee for the food supply of the liberation war. In terms of culture and education, the most significant thing is the rapid reduction of illiteracy. In the past, French imperialists used hotels and opium dens to replace schools in Vietnam, but today, in the people's Vietnam, illiteracy has been reduced from 85% to less than 30%. In the Vietnamese liberated areas, most of the people are literate. Today, the number of primary schools has increased to 2,142, and there are specialized schools such as law schools and medical schools. General national schools, from primary school to university, do not charge tuition fees.

　　After living a painful life of colonial slavery for eighty years, the Vietnamese people have proudly raised their heads in the struggle against the oppression of French imperialism. Today, the young Democratic Republic of Vietnam has grown up.

　　访越南妇女代表团
    柏生
    在全国民主妇联，我们会到了最近由越南远道跋涉抵京的越南妇女代表团，团长阮科耀红、代表潘安、黄佩环都是越南妇联全国委员会委员，黄佩环且是越南全国妇联主办的越南妇女月刊的总编辑，另一位代表黎尊芳是越南某战区妇联委员。我们兴奋地谈论着最近中越的建立邦交。
    中越首先建立邦交，这不仅是中越人民深厚友谊的发展，同时对亚洲各被压迫民族的解放运动也是一个很大的鼓舞。阮科耀红告诉我们，整个的越南人民是以最大关切的心情注视着新中国的一切。对于这次中国首先与越南正式建立外交关系的大事，使她们感到无限的喜悦，她相信全越人民都是和她们抱着同样的心情。她说，这表示着越南已经有了最值得骄傲的朋友了。这密切的友谊将会使得帝国主义者感到颤慄，同时使世界和平民主阵营更加巩固。
    我们谈到了最近法军在越南迫害华侨的事件，在越南居住的华侨大部是农民，其次为商人。他们与当地越南人民亲如兄弟，但也同样地遭受着法帝国主义者的惨酷压迫。一次最惨无人道的暴行发生在去年十一月十九日深夜，法国武装部队百余人包围了永安省青铃与流冈两个农场，对我华侨男女横加摧残抢掠，对这件暴行，华侨已经致电回国请求声援，对此暴行也同样地激起了越南人民的愤怒与同情。
    我们的话题逐渐集中到越南妇女的斗争情况，阮科耀红告诉了我们许多关于越南妇女英勇斗争的事迹。
    在法国统治时，越南妇女是生活在封建制度压迫下，自从一九四五年八月革命后，越南妇女与男子有了平等的权利，越南全国民主妇女联合会已拥有二百万会员，包括全越各阶层的民主妇女。民主妇联并扩展到了敌占区。
    四年来的民族解放战争，使越南妇女受到了坚强的锻炼。她们英勇地参加了解放战争。许多妇女参加了国家的军队或游击队。在越南南部有一个出色的女团长胡氏悲，在广治省有一个有名的女游击队员陈氏欧，她们都参加过数十次的战斗。北部一个叫做阮氏亚的，曾在第五号公路与敌人打过交通战，得到越南国家军队总司令武元甲颁发的第一号奖章。在工厂、农田、作坊、学校、医院等各种岗位上，越南妇女们都忘我地工作着，参加生产和支前。一九四八年，越南发动爱国竞赛运动后，妇女们表现了伟大的爱国热忱。在越北北江省，国防纸厂的一个女工阮氏泽在这次的爱国生产竞赛中得到了全国第一名。
    谈到越南人民对法帝及其傀儡保大的斗争，阮科耀红微笑地带着一种讽刺的语调说：保大只是跟在法帝国主义屁股后面走着下坡路的一只夹着尾巴的无用的走狗。今年春天越南人民解放军就要在广大的战线上发动总攻，最后地肃清这些法国殖民分子和它的走狗。在过去四年的民族解放战争中，越南人民在越南民主同盟领导下，已经学习了苏联与中国人民的革命斗争经验，组织了广大的人民民主统一战线，同时建立起一支强大的人民国防军队，成为越南民族解放斗争的胜利保证。
    阮科耀红还告诉了我们目前越南的一般状况。在法帝国主义的统治下，一向没有什么工业建设的越南，从八月革命以后，工业也逐渐发展起来了，特别是纺织工业、制革工业和造纸工业，同时因为战争的需要，越南也有了自己的国防工业，在越南各省成立了许多流动的兵工厂，制造地雷、手榴弹等。在农业生产方面，虽然遭受了法帝国主义的不断破坏，但由于农民的积极生产，解放战争的食粮供应获得了有力的保证。在文化教育方面，最显著的就是文盲的迅速减少。以前法帝国主义者在越南以酒店和鸦片烟馆来代替学校，但今天人民的越南，文盲已经由百分之八十五减少到百分之三十以下，在越南解放区大多数的人民都是识字的。今天小学已增加到两千一百四十二所，并且有了法学院、医学院等专门学校。一般的国立学校从小学到大学都不收学费。
    越南人民过了八十年的殖民地奴隶的痛苦生活以后，从反抗法帝国主义者压迫的斗争中，已经昂然地抬起头来。今天，年青的越南民主共和国已成长起来了。
