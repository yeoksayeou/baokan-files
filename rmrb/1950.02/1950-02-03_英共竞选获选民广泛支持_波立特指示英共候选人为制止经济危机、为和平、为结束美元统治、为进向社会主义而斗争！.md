Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, February 2nd: TASS, London, January 31st: The British Communist Party's election campaign has gained broad support from voters.

Harry Pollitt, General Secretary of the British Communist Party, who is personally campaigning in the East Rhondda constituency in South Wales, sent a letter to all Communist Party candidates. He emphasized: "The central points of our policy are to fight to stop the economic crisis, to fight for peace, to fight to end dollar domination, and to advance towards socialism." Pollitt drew attention to the fact that workers are increasingly opposed to the Labour government's wage freeze policy.

News from all areas where Communists are campaigning indicates that the people are paying close attention to the Communist Party's program.

The Communist Party candidate in Warrington (Lancashire), James Gladith, a local trade unionist, demanded the repatriation of American troops stationed in Britain when he presented his platform. There is a U.S. Air Force base near Warrington.

William Brooke, General Secretary of the Communist Youth League, is competing against Churchill in the Woodford constituency near London, and the Communist Youth League is giving him active support. On January 28th, the local branch of the Communist Youth League held a propaganda parade in the streets, carrying signs saying "Churchill Must Go."

Communist Party candidates and their supporters are conducting propaganda and explanations to housewives, workers, and other voters every day.

The National Election Fund has so far raised £12,000 for the Communist Party. 65,000 copies of the election program "The British Road to Socialism" have been sold. In the constituencies where Communist Party candidates are campaigning, 5.5 million copies of the British Communist Party's election manifesto will be distributed. In the past two weeks, the circulation of the British Communist Party's organ, the Daily Worker, has increased by 2,000 copies per day, and by 20,000 copies on weekends.
