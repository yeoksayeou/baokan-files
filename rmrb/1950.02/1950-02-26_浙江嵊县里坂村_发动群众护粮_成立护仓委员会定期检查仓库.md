　　Zhejiang Sheng County, Liban Village
    Mobilizing the Masses to Protect Grain
    Establishing a Grain Depot Protection Committee to Regularly Inspect Warehouses
    [Our Newspaper] Liban Village in Sheng County, Zhejiang Province, attaches great importance to grain protection work. The entire village has established a grain protection committee and formulated a grain protection pact.
    Since the struggles of anti-hegemony, rent reduction, and rational burden, the masses in the village have had a preliminary mobilization. Furthermore, due to its proximity to the highway and convenient transportation, the leading cadres selected the village as a district grain distribution depot. After most of the grain in the township was put into storage, in order to ensure the safety of the grain, the village convened a meeting of cadres and representatives from the entire village to conduct grain protection education. At the representative meeting, a village grain protection committee was established, with the village chief serving as the director and the militia captain and grain depot cadres serving as deputy directors. Many grain protection measures were stipulated: (1) In order to check for rain leakage, it was decided to lay a layer of paper on the grain depot. When rain leakage is discovered, water stains can be seen, and repairs can be started. Measures to prevent birds from eating: Paper should be pasted on the wooden window frames, and the windows should be opened for ventilation at certain times. To check whether the grain in the center and bottom of the warehouse is damp or hot, a small hole the size of a teacup should be opened at the bottom of the grain depot board, usually sealed with a wooden board and sealed with a strip of paper (the grain depots are all in residents' homes). During inspection, use a hollow bamboo tube, sharpened and tied with rags, and insert it into the hole. When you pull it out, the rags will fall into the warehouse. Then push the bamboo forward, and the grain in the warehouse and at the bottom will enter the bamboo tube, which can be pulled out for inspection. A system of inspection every ten days was also established, with the participation of the farmers' association, village government, grain depot, and inspection team. After the inspection, each party affixes a seal to indicate responsibility. After its establishment, the Grain Protection Committee convened a village meeting to mobilize the masses to participate in grain protection work. More than 100 members of the farmers' association signed up on the spot. Now, the masses in the village regard protecting grain as their glorious task.

　　浙江嵊县里坂村
    发动群众护粮
    成立护仓委员会定期检查仓库
    【本报讯】浙江嵊县里坂村重视护粮工作，全村已成立护粮委员会，并订出护粮公约。
    该村自经反霸、减租、合理负担等斗争后，群众已有了初步发动，又因靠近公路，交通方便，故领导干部即将该村选为区粮食分库。该村在全乡粮食大部入仓后，为保证粮食的安全，曾召集干部及全村代表大会，进行护粮教育。在代表大会上，成立了村护粮委员会，由村长兼主任委员，民兵队长、粮库干部兼副主任，并规定了很多护粮办法：（一）为了检查雨淋，决定在粮仓上铺一层纸。发现雨淋屋漏时看出水渍，即可着手修屋。防止鸟吃的办法：在木窗格上糊纸，一定时候开窗透气。检查仓库中心及底层粮食是否潮湿或发热，在粮库板下底开一杯口大的小洞，平时用木板封住，上加封条（粮库都在住户家）。检查时，用一只削尖并扎上破布的空心竹筒，对准洞口插进去，往外一拖，破布就掉入仓里。再将竹子往前一推，仓中与底里粮食就进入竹筒，拉出来便可检查。又订出十天检查一次的制度，由农会、村政府、粮库与检查股共同参加。检查后各贴一张封条，以示负责。护粮委员会即于成立后召开村民大会，发动群众参加护粮工作。当场就有一百多个农会会员报名。现该村群众都以保护粮食为自己的光荣任务。
