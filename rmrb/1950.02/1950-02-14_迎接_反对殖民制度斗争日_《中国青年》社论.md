　　Welcoming “Day of Struggle Against Colonial System”
    *China Youth* Editorial

    The Central Committee of the China New Democratic Youth League's official publication, *China Youth*, issue 32, published an editorial titled "Welcoming 'Day of Struggle Against Colonial System,'" stating:

    February 21st is the "Day of Struggle Against Colonial System." On this day, democratic youth around the world, under the call of the World Federation of Democratic Youth, will express their firm will to oppose imperialism, oppose the colonial system, and support the national liberation movements of the people in colonial countries!

    Democratic youth around the world will enthusiastically express this will because the colonial system is a dark and backward system, under which more than a billion people are deprived of their rights to survival and freedom. Also, because the national liberation movements in colonial countries are inseparable from the current worldwide people's movement against imperialism and for peace and democracy, it is an important component. The situation for commemorating this day of struggle this year is: the Chinese people have overthrown the reactionary rule of imperialism and its running dogs for a hundred years and have achieved a great victory; the people's liberation wars in Vietnam and Burma have achieved significant results; the people of Malaya, the Philippines, and Indonesia continue to wage guerrilla warfare; the people of India, Iran, and other countries are striving for genuine national independence and democratic rights amidst reactionary rule; and the level of awareness of the people in colonial and semi-colonial countries around the world is increasing day by day. That is to say, the struggle against the colonial system has achieved victory and will continue to achieve victory. We, the youth of China, must enthusiastically support this day, not only because our China is a member of the world peace and democracy camp, but also because our China has suffered deeply from imperialist oppression for a hundred years and has only just been liberated from the shackles of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism today. Our millions of overseas Chinese are still suffering under the rule of imperialism, and our neighbors – the people of Southeast Asian countries – are all under the oppression of the colonial system. The struggle of the people of Southeast Asian countries against imperialism and for freedom and liberation is also helping us to consolidate our victory!

    We call on the youth and Youth League members across the country to welcome the "Day of Struggle Against Colonial System," to understand the current situation of the national liberation movements in colonial and semi-colonial countries, to strengthen internationalist education, and to publicize the significance of the national liberation movements in colonial and semi-colonial countries and the struggle of democratic youth around the world against imperialism.

　　迎接“反对殖民制度斗争日”
    《中国青年》社论
    【新华社北京十三日电】中国新民主主义青年团中央委员会机关刊物《中国青年》第三十二期，以“迎接‘反对殖民制度斗争日’”为题，发表社论称：
    二月二十一日，是“反对殖民制度斗争日”，全世界的民主青年，将在这一天，在世界民主青年联盟的号召之下，表示出反对帝国主义，反对殖民制度，支援殖民地国家人民的民族解放运动的坚决的意志！
    全世界民主青年，将热烈地表示这种意志，因为殖民制度是黑暗的、落后的制度，十余万万的人民在这种制度下被剥夺了生存和自由的权利；也因为殖民地国家的民族解放运动是和当前全世界人民反对帝国主义的和平民主运动分不开的，是它的重要的组成部分。今年纪念这个斗争日的情势是：中国人民已经推翻了一百年来帝国主义及其走狗的反动统治，取得了伟大的胜利；越南、缅甸人民解放战争，得到重大战果；马来亚、菲律宾、印度尼西亚人民继续进行游击战争；印度、伊朗等国人民在反动统治中争取真正的民族独立及民主权利；全世界殖民地与半殖民地人民觉悟程度日益提高。就是说：反对殖民制度的斗争是取得了胜利并且还要继续取得胜利。我们中国的青年们，要热烈拥护这个日子，不仅因为我们中国是世界和平民主阵营的一分子，也因为我们中国，一百年来深受帝国主义的压迫，今天刚从帝国主义、封建主义、官僚资本主义的桎梏下解放出来，我们千余万的海外侨胞，仍在帝国主义的统治下受着苦难，并且，我们的近邻——东南亚各国人民，都是在殖民制度的压迫之下，东南亚各国人民反对帝国主义、争取自由解放的斗争，也就是帮助我们巩固我们的胜利！
    我们号召全国青年及青年团员迎接“反对殖民制度斗争日”，应该了解当前殖民地半殖民地国家民族解放运动的形势，加强国际主义教育，并应该宣传殖民地半殖民地国家的民族解放运动及全世界民主青年反对帝国主义的斗争的意义。
