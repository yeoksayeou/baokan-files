Learning from "Moscow Character"
    Hong Shen
    If in the field of drama, there could be a few "must-see performances for cadres," just as in the field of theory there are several "must-read books for cadres," then the play "Moscow Character" by the Soviet Sofronov, translated into Chinese by the People's Art Theatre and awarded the Stalin Prize first prize in 1948, would certainly be one of them.
    This is a rare comedy. As K. Zopov, artistic director of the Moscow Small Theatre, said, "This script... is so pleasant... so optimistic... This is a poetic comedy, a pure comedy... It makes people believe in our life, believe in our reality, believe in our future, believe in the kind of thoughts we live by and breathe by." Why is it able to do this? Because its theme is very realistic. Its main object of self-criticism is a certain "tendency of departmentalism" that may individually occur in socialist construction and socialist production competition.
    As far as the script is concerned, this play has three characteristics. First, there is not a single villain in the whole play. Neither Factory Director Podapov of a certain machine tool manufacturing plant, who has a tendency of departmentalism in his work, nor Chief of the Planning Department of the factory, Tsai Treifu, who has a tendency of departmentalism in his conduct, are the same as the so-called villains in the ordinary sense. Podapov's refusal to accept a large number of orders for printing machines from the textile factory is by no means the bureaucratic style of "the more you do, the more mistakes you make, the less you do, the fewer mistakes you make, and it's better to do nothing than to do something," and "it's better to do less than to do more" in a corrupt society. He is a capable and hardworking worker; thanks to his leadership and the efforts of all the staff, the output is constantly increasing, often breaking the quota. The production percentage last month was 137; they are using all their energy to carry out the assigned tasks, supplying machine tools for the agricultural machinery manufacturing industry, and trying to complete their five-year plan in three and a half years. Admittedly, Podapov is wrong. He wants his factory to make contributions, so he cannot but only consider the tasks of his own factory, and cannot consider the tasks of other factories as well, such as the textile factory—to help them so that they can at least complete the five-year plan in four years, even if it is not three and a half years. However, even on this point, there is still some reason. All production is planned. The original plan was for the production of tools for heavy industry. Now he is asked to change the plan for light industry, can't he raise objections? And shouldn't his opinion be respected and considered?
    As for Tsai Treifu, he is also not the kind of petty bureaucrat who is often played on the Chinese stage, who specializes in flattering, guessing, and ingratiating himself with his superiors, pushing everything to his superiors and being afraid of taking responsibility and taking risks. He is sincerely loyal to his superiors. When he thinks that the decision of his superiors is correct, he will certainly not object, let alone express contrary or different opinions behind his back. His mistake is that he does not consider the problem deeply enough and not principled enough, and is too easily influenced by Podapov; at one time, he seemed to be following him without principle. Therefore, when he begins to understand (at the district committee meeting in the third act), he will have those ridiculous performances of being contradictory and at a loss.
    Both of them corrected their mistakes later. Podapov and Tsai Treifu are both loyal Communist Party members. "The Party's decision is the law to me." When District Committee Secretary Porozova suggested that "the ministry be requested to approve the machine tool manufacturing plant to accept the order for manufacturing Moskvitch machines, and Comrade Podapov should immediately prepare to manufacture this kind of machine," Podapov had no objection—after that, he really worked hard to implement this decision, and successfully completed the "two large orders" as well. However, here, one thing should be specially pointed out: that is, the decision of the district committee is not simply an administrative adjustment, requiring the machine tool manufacturing plant to delay their plan to break the quota to help the textile factory at the expense of themselves. Why was there such a decision at the meeting? Because after the senior technician of the machine tool manufacturing plant, Klivosing, "spent a lot of time studying the possibility of this batch of orders," and "carefully studied the machine in question," he believed that accepting this batch of printing machine orders, although "it would cause major difficulties and would in fact cause the main plan to be derailed for a period of time," if "the technology is improved and some of the work that is now done by hand is mechanized," and "some new" "highly productive devices and equipment" are manufactured, "and the transportation is improved," they "can accept this batch of orders," "and will never disrupt other work"—"two different machines can be produced," and it will still not hinder the completion of the five-year plan in three and a half years. (Note: The parentheses are quoted from the dialogue in the third act.) Because there is such a guarantee—they, including Podapov and Tsai Treifu, trust this senior technician—the problem is solved. Podapov and Tsai Treifu were convinced by the truth; therefore, accepting the decision and correcting the mistake were not forced or unpleasant at all. Although they were criticized, they were by no means villains.
    Second, this play is written with great humor; it can make the audience laugh from beginning to end, and pay attention to the shortcomings of things in the midst of laughter. But this is a truly high-level comedy, without far-fetchedness, without pretentiousness, and without vulgar taste. Sometimes what is laughable is a situation—for example, Podapov, because his wife, Griniva, criticized him at the meeting, got angry and did not go home, and stayed in the factory for many days, but because his socks were torn and his shirt was dirty, and he had no replacement, he asked someone to fetch them but they could not be fetched, so he had to go home to meet her himself... etc.; sometimes what is laughable is some behavior... for example, Tsai Treifu expressed his opinion at the meeting, and when he saw someone recording every word of his speech, he was afraid that there was something wrong and expressed his unwillingness, but he did not want to cancel the record completely, because he did not want to be criticized for "not speaking at the meeting"... etc.; sometimes what makes people can't help but smile is a few wonderful words, for example, when Podapov asked Griniva to go to formally register their marriage at the end of the play, he said: "Isn't now the time for you to change your name?... We can all be called Podapov." Griniva said: "Of course I can go to any organization you want us to go to, but I will still be called Griniva." Podapov said: "The content is Griniva, and the form is Podapova"... etc.—all the jokes come from excavating and showing the contradictions and oppositions that exist in things or characters that have not been unified for a while. It is not easy to write such a serious theme into such a vivid drama.
    The third unique feature is that this play tells us about the character of ordinary people in the socialist country. Regarding "Moscow Character," there is a passage in the play that says: "This is a tenacious character. That is, every word counts. Contribute everything you have to the country. Your thoughts, your abilities, your heart, your precious life. Everything, everything." Another person added: "Moscow character also has a characteristic... that is, the courage to admit one's mistakes." And he also said: "I'm afraid that if the people of the Urals, Ukraine, Belarus, or Kuban heard your words, they would be unhappy. Do you think that their character, the character of the entire Soviet people, is different?... In other words, Moscow character is Russian character, Bolshevik character." This is said very clearly and concretely. But the inspiration we get is more than that. In this play, we really see healthy, bright, complete, and optimistic personalities. At the same time, we can no longer see the dark, broken, sentimental, and pessimistic personalities in that corrupt society. As A. Lavretsky said in his "Gorky on Socialist Realism" (published in the fourth issue of "International Literature" monthly in 1937): "Literature is no longer pessimistic, limited only to negation. The criticism of capitalist landlord society given by the old literature had its objective revolutionary significance because it negated certain things. The revolutionary significance of socialist realism lies in its affirmation of socialist society. ... Soviet literature, under its domination, has completely new materials... that is, a victory that has never existed in human history, the victory of the proletariat... The historical significance of this victory prohibits the use of the hopelessness and meaninglessness of personal life as a subject for writing in Soviet literature." (Note: Translated from English)
    In terms of performance, because I have visited the People's Art Theatre's rehearsals several times, I dare to say that the director, actors, and all workers are working sincerely and carefully, and can complete their task of conveying the content of the script. Of course, the results cannot be as good as when the Moscow Art Theatre performed this play. But the theme is grasped, and the characters are expressed truly. The whole play is tense, lively, humorous, and credible.
    In short, using drama, especially comedy, to conduct cadre education is indeed a "model work." In addition to the above, there are many places where we can learn from the play—their relationship as husband and wife, their love, their views on divorce, their reasonable and humane handling, discussion, and solution of problems, and the fact that the words and deeds of people with political status can have political influence and should not be neglected in the slightest... etc.—the more we watch it, the more we will gain. As for the professional learning of drama workers, that is a matter of course—writing to this point, in this regard, I really don't want to say more.

### 向《莫斯科性格》学习

　　向《莫斯科性格》学习
    洪深
    如果在戏剧方面也不妨有几出“干部必看”的演出正像在理论方面有若干册“干部必读”的书籍的话，那么这次人民艺术剧院上演的已译成为国话的苏联梭弗洛诺夫的于一九四八年获得斯大林奖金首奖的话剧“莫斯科性格”必然会是其中之一。
    这是一出罕有的喜剧。如莫斯科小剧场艺术指导Ｋ左波夫所言，“这个剧本……如此愉快……如此乐观……这是一出诗的喜剧，这是一出纯粹的喜剧……它使人相信我们的生活，相信我们的现实，相信我们的未来，相信我们赖以生活和用以呼吸的那种思想。”为什么能够这样？因为它的主题是十分现实的。它的主要的自我批判的对象是社会主义建设中、社会主义生产竞赛中，可能个别发生的某种“本位主义的倾向”。
    就剧本而言，这部剧有三个特点。第一，全剧没有一个反派人物。不论在工作上有本位主义倾向的某机器工具制造厂厂长波达波夫，或是在做人上有本位主义倾向的厂里的计划部主任蔡崔夫，这两位被批评的人物，都和寻常所谓反派完全不同。波达波夫的拒绝接受纺织厂大批印花机的定货，决不是那腐败社会中的“多做多错、少做少错、不做不错”，“多一事不如少一事”的官僚作风。他是一个能干而努力的工作者；由于他的领导，以及全厂人员的奋发，产量不断增高，经常在突破定额。上个月的生产百分率就是一三七；他们正用全副气力执行被规定的任务，为农业机器制造工业供给机器工具，而想要在三年半的时间内完成他们的五年计划。诚然，波达波夫是有错误的，他企求他那厂能够立功，因此他不免只为一厂的任务打算，而不能为别厂的任务也打算一下，譬如说纺织厂——去给人家帮助，使人家至少也能在四年之内完成五年计划，即使不必是三年半吧。但是，就是在这一点上，也还是不无理由的。一切生产是有计划性的。原来的计划是为重工业生产工具。现在要他为了轻工业而改动计划，难道他就不可以提出意见？而他的意见就不应该被尊重被考虑么？
    至于蔡崔夫，也不是中国舞台上常见扮演的那种专事奉迎，揣摹，博取上级欢心，一切向上级推诿而自己怕负责任怕担干系的小官僚。他是诚挚的忠实于上级的。上级的决定，在他认为是正确的时候，他当然不会反对，更不会在背后表示相反或不同的意见。他的错误是考虑问题不够深刻不够原则，太容易受波达波夫的影响；有一个时候几乎像是无原则的服从。所以在他开始明白时（第三幕区委开会时），就会有那些自相矛盾不知所措的可笑的表现。
    两个人到后来都改正了错误。波达波夫和蔡崔夫都是忠诚的共产党员。“党的决议对我就是法律”。在区委书记波罗左娃提议“请部里批准工具机制造厂接受制造莫斯克维契机器的订单，波达波夫同志要立刻准备制造这种机器”的时候，波达波夫未有异议——其后，他果然努力执行这个决议，而且把“两大笔订货”同样胜利完成。不过，在这里有一事应当特别指出：就是，区委的决定并不单纯是行政上的调剂，要求工具机制造厂自我牺牲地延缓他们的突破定额的计划去帮纺织厂的忙。开会时为什么会有那样的决定呢？为了工具机制造厂的高级技师克利伏胜，在“花了很多时间研究这批订货的可能性”，又“仔细研究了一下问题中的这个机器”之后，以为接受这批印花机订货，尽管“要引起重大的困难，并且事实上也会使主要计划脱节一个时期”，但如果“改进技术，把一些现在用手做的工作机械化”，“造些新的”“有高度生产力的装置和器械”，“再改进运输”，他们“能够接受这批订货”，“而且决不会破坏其它的工作”——“可出两种不同的机器”，仍然不致妨碍三年半完成五年计划。（注：括弧内系引第三幕对话）因为有这样一个保证——他们，波达波夫与蔡崔夫在内，都信任这位高级技师的——问题就得到了解决。波达波夫，以及蔡崔夫，是被真理说服了的；所以接受决议，改正错误，丝毫没有勉强或不愉快。他们虽然被批评，但绝不是反派。
    第二，这出戏写得十分有风趣；从头至尾能使观众发笑，而且就在粲然之中注意了事物的缺点。但这是真正的高级喜剧，没有牵强，没有做作，没有低劣趣味。有时可笑的是一种情境——例如波达波夫因为他的妻子葛利尼娃在开会时批评了他，便负气不回家，多日住宿在厂里，但因袜子破了衬衫脏了，没得替换，托人去拿又拿不来，不得不自己回家去和她见面……之类；有时可笑的是一些行为……例如蔡崔夫在开会时发表了意见，看见有人把他的发言每字记录，惟恐有什么不妥而表示不愿，但又不欲将记录全部撤消，因为也不欲受到“在会场不发言”的批评……之类；有时令人忍隽不禁的是几句绝妙的言词，例如波达波夫在戏将结束时要求葛利尼娃同去作结婚正式登记的时候，他说：“现在不正是你该改一改名字的时候吗？……我们都叫波达波夫就行了”。葛利尼娃说：“你要我们同去什么机关当然都可以，但是我仍旧要叫葛利尼娃的”。波达波夫说：“内容是葛利尼娃，形式是波达波娃”……之类——所有笑料都是从发掘与显现那存在于事物或性格中一时未能统一的矛盾与对立而得来的。以这样严肃的主题，竟能写成这样生动的戏剧，真是不易几及的。
    第三独到之处，是这个剧本告诉了我们那社会主义国家里的一般人的性格。关于《莫斯科性格》，剧本中有一处这样说：“这是顽强的性格。那就是说一句，算一句。把你所有的一切贡献给国家。你的思想，你的能力，你的心，你宝贵的生命。一切一切。”另一人补充：“莫斯科性格还有一种特性……就是有勇气去承认自己的错误。”并且还说：“我怕你的话假使给乌拉尔、乌克兰、白俄罗斯，或者古班的人民听见了要不高兴的。你以为他们的性格，整个苏维埃人民的性格，是另外一种么？……换句话说，莫斯科性格就是俄罗斯的性格、布尔雪维克性格。”这是说得很明白而具体的。但我们所得到的启示尚不止此。在这出戏里，我们才真看到了健全的、明快的、完整的、乐观的人格。同时再也看不到那腐败社会中的阴暗的、破碎的、伤感的、悲观的人格。正如A．Lavretsky在他的《高尔基论社会主义现实主义》（载一九三七年第四期《国际文学》月刊）文中所说：“文学不再是悲观的，仅仅限于否定而已。旧文学所给予资本家地主社会的批评是有它的客观的革命意义的，由于它否定了某些东西。社会主义现实主义的革命意义在它的肯定社会主义社会。……苏维埃文学在它的支配之下，有完全簇新的材料……那就是人类历史上从未有过的一个胜利，无产阶级的胜利……这个胜利的历史意义禁止在苏维埃文学中使用个人生活的无希望无意义为写作的题材。”（注：从英文译出）
    在演出方面，因为我曾参观人民艺术剧院的数次排演，我敢说导演演员和一切工作者是在诚恳地谨慎地努力从事，可以完成他们传达剧本内容的任务的。当然，成绩不能像莫斯科艺术剧院演出此剧时那样好。但是主题是把握了的，人物是表现真切的。全剧紧张，生动，有风趣，而真实可信。
    总之，用戏剧，尤其用喜剧来进行干部教育，这诚然是一部“范作”。除了上面所述而外，我们可以向剧中学习的地方正多——他们夫妻间的相处，他们的恋爱，他们对于离婚的见解，他们处理问题讨论问题解决问题的合理而亦人情，以及有政治地位的人一举一动都可有政治影响而不应有丝毫轻忽……等等——我们多看几遍，必然所得更多。至于戏剧工作者在业务上的学习，那是当然的事——走笔至此，在这一方面，真不愿多说了。
