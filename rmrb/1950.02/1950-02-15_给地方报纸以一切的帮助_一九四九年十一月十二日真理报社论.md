　　Giving All Assistance to Local Newspapers
    ——Truth Editorial, November 12, 1949

　　Vladimir Ilyich Lenin once said, "Capitalism uses newspapers as capitalist enterprises, as tools for the rich to make money, to enjoy themselves, and to communicate information for them, while for the working masses, they are tools to deceive and fool them."

　　Soviet newspapers are a new type of newspaper. The Communist Party, Lenin, and Stalin regarded newspapers as a great tool for the communist education of the masses and for socialist construction. In the struggle against the old and for the victory of the new and progressive, in creative labor, the Soviet people regard newspapers as loyal and reliable friends, advisors, and assistants.

　　In most parts of our country, local newspapers published in the languages of the various Soviet nationalities are the most numerous of our publications. Local newspapers emerged during the period of the collective farm mass movement and played a significant role in our Party's struggle for the victory of the collective farm system. In the 1930s, local newspapers were common throughout the Soviet state. The newspapers publicized the Party's great calls among the masses, patiently and tenaciously explained the superiority of the collective farm road, and educated the masses to build a new life. The Soviet Union now has more than four thousand local newspapers with a total circulation of several million copies.

　　Local newspapers are directly connected with local life. The newspapers use approachable and clear facts and examples from the surrounding environment to publicize Lenin-Stalin's ideas, explain the resolutions of the Party and the government, and help the working masses to implement these resolutions. Newspapers play a significant role in the social, political, and economic life of various regions.

　　Local newspapers help Party organizations cultivate and educate our patriots, and the brave innovators in all economic and cultural construction departments. The fame of outstanding Stakhanovite workers and heroes of socialist labor is first and foremost introduced through local newspapers. Ivan Shatsky, the captain of the tractor team at the Mikhailovsky Tractor Station in the Krasnodar region, which is famous throughout the country, was the initiator of the highest quality tractor team competition. We are happy to point out that the Gulgianisky District Committee and the local newspaper *Red Banner Commune* were the first to enthusiastically support this proposal.

　　Today, this newspaper publishes several letters from the editors of local newspapers. In brief reports, they describe the creative initiative of the newspapers, the connection with readers, the work of rural correspondents, and some serious shortcomings in the leadership of local newspapers by some Party organizations.

　　Local newspapers have grown into a huge force and become a great force for carrying out communist education and organizing the working masses. The readers are also not the same as they were fifteen or twenty years ago. Their field of knowledge has expanded, their ideological and cultural level has improved, and their life experience has also become richer.

　　The current Soviet countryside is a completely new countryside. At present, the heroes of our era, the creators of new life, the loyal and conscious laborers in the socialist fields, the Stakhanovite workers, the brave innovators, and the large number of rural intellectuals determine the face of the countryside. Collective labor and the public property of collective farms, mass socialist competitions, Soviet top-notch technology, power stations, radio stations, cinemas, schools, clubs, and cultural palaces, classrooms, and libraries determine the lifestyle of the new countryside. How many fresh and noteworthy things are growing in our lives every day!

　　The primary task of newspapers is to reflect fresh things, describe the emergence of creativity and the unprecedented upsurge of the power of the working masses. Newspapers should rely on advanced things to support innovators in industry and agricultural economy with all their strength and means, spread examples and advanced initiatives in our work, and cultivate a noble will that is as important as the achievements of advanced Soviet people. In order to maintain the freshness of the newspaper itself, it is necessary to fight against arrogance, complacency, and self-satisfaction, oppose old habits and stagnant phenomena, and carry out an irreconcilable struggle against shortcomings.

　　One of the important reasons for the serious shortcomings in the work of many local newspapers is, first of all, the weak leadership of the Party's district committees and state committees. Some district committees still do not delve into the editing work of local newspapers, do not pay attention to regularly improving the content of the newspapers, and do not pay attention to helping the newspapers to develop Bolshevik criticism and self-criticism. For example, this year, no Party district committee in the Samarkand Oblast has discussed the issue of journalistic work.

　　In the local political and economic work, some Party district committees obviously underestimate the role and significance of newspapers. Only an incorrect attitude towards journalistic work can explain the phenomenon of entrusting the editing work of newspapers to some immature cadres, or the editors themselves being separated from their basic work for a long time. For example, the situation in the Shrotsky District of the Lyosas District and the Ughsky Factory District of the Galus District is like this, where the local newspaper editors have appeared as plenipotentiaries of various movements for a long time.

　　A good and reputable newspaper in the hands of the Party's district committee is the most important pillar for leading the economic, political and cultural life of the region. However, a good newspaper cannot be without the leadership and help of the editor and the Party's district committee.

　　The "Resolution on Local Newspapers" adopted by the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) in 1940 stated that the secretaries of the district committees and municipal committees should personally lead the local newspapers, check the content of the newspapers daily, and use the newspapers to solve all the urgent political and economic tasks facing the region, and politically and culturally ensure the selection of knowledgeable staff for the newspapers. However, the leaders of some Party organizations have not implemented these requirements.

　　The resolution of the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) on local newspapers suggested that the state committees, border committees, and the central committees of the communist parties of the various union republics improve the political ideology and organizational leadership of local newspapers: systematically discuss some issues in local newspapers, listen to reports on the work of newspapers and the leadership of the district committees and municipal committees over newspapers, and carefully understand the content of local newspapers when checking the work of local Party organizations. However, some Party state committees, such as the Orlovsky All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) state committee, have not studied the work of local newspapers for a long time.

　　The flexible and effective way for the Party to lead local newspapers is the newspaper review in the newspapers of various states and republics. With the help of insightful reviews, it is possible to spread the experience and achievements of various newspapers, expose the shortcomings in the work of newspapers, point out the direction of editing work, and help newspapers with professional suggestions and instructions.

　　The mission of local newspapers is to solve tasks of great nature. These newspapers should become collective propagandists, collective agitators, and organizers in the struggle for the communist education of the masses and for the further upsurge of economic and cultural construction. But only by constantly expanding and consolidating ties with the working masses, and by relying on the active correspondents among workers, collective farm members, and intellectuals in all work, can the glorious tasks of newspapers be successfully completed.

　　Twenty-five years ago, Comrade Stalin wrote when congratulating *The Peasant Newspaper*: "Cherish the rural correspondents - your army, like the apple of your eye." Our journalists should always remember and tenaciously implement Comrade Stalin's instruction.

　　The task of the Party organization is to lead its newspapers every day, give the newspapers all assistance, improve the political ideology and cultural level of the newspapers, and enhance its role in the struggle for the great cause of communism.

　　给地方报纸以一切的帮助
    ——一九四九年十一月十二日真理报社论
    弗拉吉米尔·伊里奇·列宁曾经说过，“资本主义把报纸作为资本主义的企业，作为富人们发财致富，开心取乐，为他们通报消息的工具，而对劳动群众说来，则是欺骗他们和愚弄他们的工具”。
    苏维埃报纸是新型的报纸。共产党、列宁和斯大林把报纸作为群众的共产主义教育的伟大的工具，社会主义建设的工具。在反对陈腐事物的、为新的和前进的胜利斗争中，在劳动创造中，苏维埃人把报纸看作忠实可靠的朋友、顾问和助手。
    在我国大部分地区中，以苏联各民族语言出版的地方报纸是我们的出版物中为数最多的一种。地方报纸产生于集体农庄群众运动时期，并在我党为集体农庄制度的胜利的斗争中起着重大作用。在二十世纪三十年代的时候，苏维埃国家已经普遍地有了地方报纸。报纸在群众中宣传党的伟大号召，耐心地和顽强地解释了集体农庄道路的优越性，教育群众建设新的生活。苏联现在已经有了四千多种地方报纸，发行总数达好几百万份。
    地方报纸是和地方生活直接联系着的。报纸用周围环境中的接近而明确的事实和例子来宣传列宁——斯大林的思想，解释党和政府的决议，并帮助劳动群众执行这些决议。报纸在各地区的社会政治经济生活中起着显著的作用。
    地方报纸帮助党组织培养和教育我国的爱国主义者，一切经济和文化建设部门中的勇敢的革新者。优秀的斯达哈诺夫运动者和社会主义劳动英雄之成名首先是经过地方报纸介绍的。全国闻名的克拉斯诺达尔斯克边区米哈洛夫斯基拖拉机站的拖拉机工作队队长伊万·沙茨基就是最高质量的拖拉机工作队竞赛的发起者。我们乐于指出，古尔加尼斯基区委会与该地报纸《红旗公社》报是首先热烈地支持了这个建议的。
    今天本报刊载了几封地方报纸编辑们的来信。在简短的报道中，他们叙述了关于创造性的报纸的主动性，关于联系读者，关于农村通讯员工作以及关于某些党组织在领导地方报纸中所产生的某些严重缺点的问题。
    地方报纸已成长为一支巨大的力量，并成为进行共产主义教育和组织劳动群众的伟大工作。就是读者也不比十五——二十年以前的读者了。他们的知识领域扩大了，思想和文化水平提高了，他们的生活经验也丰富起来了。
    现在的苏维埃农村是完全新的农村。目前我们这一时代的英雄，新生活的创造者，社会主义田地里的忠实和自觉的劳动者，斯达哈诺夫运动者，勇敢的革新者，为数众多的农村知识分子决定了农村的面貌。集体劳动和集体农庄的公共财产，群众性的社会主义竞赛，苏维埃的头等技术，电力站，无线电分站，电影院，学校，俱乐部和文化宫，课堂和图书馆决定了新农村的生活方式。多少新鲜的和值得注意的事物每天每天地在我们的生活中生长着啊！
    报纸的首要任务就是反映新鲜事物，描述创造性的出现和劳动群众力量的空前未有的高潮。报纸应该依靠先进的事物以一切的力量和办法来支持工业和农业经济中的革新者，传播我们工作中的范例和先进的倡议，培养和苏维埃先进人类的成就同等重要的高尚意志。为了报纸本身的新鲜事物的保持，就必须向自高自大，安于现状和自满自足作斗争，反对旧习惯和停滞不前的现象，对缺点进行不调和的斗争。
    许多地方报纸工作中的严重缺点的重要原因之一，首先就是党的区委会和州委会方面的软弱的领导。还有的区委会至今没有深入地方报纸编辑工作，不注意经常地改善报纸的内容，不注意帮助报纸展开布尔什维克的批评和自我批评。例如，今年在沙玛尔加斯基州任何一个党的区委会也没有讨论过关于新闻工作的问题。
    在地方的政治和经济工作中，某些党的区委会显然对报纸的作用和意义估计不足。只有对新闻工作的不正确的态度，才能解释把报纸的编辑工作委托给一些不成熟的干部去做，或编辑本身在很长的时期脱离了他的基本工作的这些现象。例如，辽沙斯基州史洛夫斯基区和加卢斯基州乌格斯基工厂区的情况就是这样的，那里的地方报纸编辑很长一个时期都以各种运动的全权代表的身分出现。
    好的有威信的报纸在党的区委会手中是该地区经济政治和文化生活领导的最重要的支柱。然而好的报纸是不能没有编辑和党区委会的领导和帮助的。
    一九四○年联共党（布）中央委员会通过的“关于地方报纸的决议”中说，区委和市委书记应当亲自领导地方报纸，每日检查报纸的内容，并将报纸用于解决该地区面临的一切迫切的政治和经济的任务，在政治上与文化上保证为报纸选择有学识的工作人员。然而某些党组织的领导者没有执行这些要求。
    联共党（布）中央关于地方报纸的决议中给各州委会、各边区委员会和各加盟共和国共产党中央委员会建议改善地方报纸的政治思想和组织的领导：有系统的讨论地方报纸中的一些问题，听取关于报纸工作以及区委会和市委会领导报纸的报告，在检查地方党组织工作的时候，细心地了解地方报纸的内容。然而某些党州委会，如奥尔洛夫斯基联共党（布）州委会，就很长一个时期没有研究过关于地方报纸工作的问题。
    党领导地方报纸的灵活而有效力的方式就是各州和各共和国报纸中的报纸述评。在精到的述评的帮助之下能够传播各报的经验和成就，揭露报纸工作中的缺点，指出编辑工作的方向，以业务上的建议和指示来帮助报纸。
    地方报纸的使命是解决具有重大性质的任务。这些报纸应该为群众的共产主义教育、为经济和文化建设更进一步高涨的斗争中成为集体的宣传者，集体的鼓动者和组织者。但是只有在每日不停地扩大并巩固与劳动群众的联系，并在一切工作中依靠工人、集体农庄庄员和知识分子中的积极的通讯员，才能胜利地完成报纸的这些光荣任务。
    二十五年以前，斯大林同志在祝贺《农民报》的时候写道：“要爱护农村通讯员——你们的军队，像爱护自己的眼珠一样。”我们的新闻工作者应该经常记得并顽强地执行斯大林同志的这个指示。
    党组织的任务是每天每天地领导自己的报纸，给报纸以一切的帮助，提高报纸的政治思想和文化水平，在为共产主义的伟大事业的斗争中提高其作用。
