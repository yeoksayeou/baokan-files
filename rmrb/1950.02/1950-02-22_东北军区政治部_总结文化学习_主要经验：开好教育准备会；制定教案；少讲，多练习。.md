　　Northeast Military Region Political Department
    Summarizes Cultural Learning
    Main experiences: Hold education preparation meetings well; formulate lesson plans; less lecturing, more practice.
    [Our Newspaper Despatch] Northeast News: The Political Department of the Northeast Military Region recently summarized the cultural education work of the troops in the region and reached the following preliminary experiences: First, education preparation meetings must be held well. Because the cultural instructors in the troops currently have a relatively low level of education and lack work experience, holding preparation meetings well has a great effect on improving teaching methods and improving the work ability of the instructors. The content of the preparation meeting should be: determine the weekly course schedule, study the central idea and difficult problems of the text, and study the lesson plan and teaching methods. To hold the preparation meeting well, the following must be done: (1) Before the meeting, the regimental political department of the troops should notify the cultural instructors of the research center so that they can collect materials, consider problems, and prepare opinions in advance. The leading comrades of the troop education work should seek a full understanding of the situation of the cultural education work in the company, so as to put forward the central issues in the meeting. (2) Each meeting should have a center, the purpose of which is to solve the main problems at present. For example, if the main problem at present is that the instructors do not know how to make lesson plans, then the focus should be on studying how to make lesson plans. Preparation meetings should not be held as general reporting meetings, so that the main problems cannot be solved well. (3) Everyone should be a student and everyone should be a teacher when the meeting is held, avoiding the way the leaders "give lectures" to the instructors. Everyone should raise questions, everyone should study, and finally the leading comrades should make a summary. Or designate one person to introduce their experience, let everyone discuss it, and finally make a summary. By adopting such a mass line approach, the meeting will be lively and the problems will be solved more thoroughly. Second, the cultural instructor must formulate a lesson plan for each course he teaches, so that the teaching work can be carried out in a planned and prepared manner. When formulating a lesson plan, attention should be paid to: (1) The main content of the lesson plan should include the central idea and teaching purpose of the text, the teaching methods, steps, and time allocation, and the content and methods of the exercises. The Chinese language course should add explanations of new characters and new words. (2) It should proceed from the actual situation and make different lesson plans according to different groups and different texts, and should not be the same across the board. It should be formulated according to the acceptance level of the soldiers rather than according to how much the instructors know. Third, several issues that should be paid attention to in teaching methods: (1) The issue of explanation and practice. It is necessary to ensure that the amount of explanation is small and the amount of practice is large (generally, it should account for two-thirds of the study time, and at least one-half). The explanation should first of all pay attention to being correct. For example, some instructors said: "Qin Shi Huang was an imperialist, the peasants were the proletariat, and the proletariat did not have the leadership of the Communist Party at that time, and the result was failure." This is an incorrect explanation. Secondly, it should be simple and clear. For example, when teaching arithmetic to beginners, do not start by talking about formulas and rules, but tell them simple algorithms. After they can calculate, then talk about the principles of rules and formulas, so that it is easier to understand. In terms of practice, for low-grade soldiers, emphasis should be placed on dictation, joining sentences, and correcting wrong words. Among them, dictation has the greatest effect. According to a test in a certain division, a company that implemented dictation practice answered 97.5 percent correctly, while a company that did not implement dictation practice answered only 53.5 percent correctly. For high-grade soldiers, attention should be paid to improving writing ability, practicing writing words and diaries, and practicing writing articles after having a foundation. Grammar must be combined with homework. Composition review is the best way to teach grammar. (2) Pay attention to enlightenment and induction and carry out teaching with objects and pictures. Because the soldiers are all young or middle-aged, their understanding is strong. The instructors should pay attention to enlightening the soldiers to use their brains to think about problems at any time, let them raise questions and practice answering them themselves. All questions that have been considered by the soldiers, and finally summarized and answered by the instructors, will have a much greater educational effect. In addition, the teaching method for ordinary soldiers should be from concrete to abstract, from shallow to deep, and from near to far. Physical objects and picture teaching can help soldiers easily understand problems. (3) It is necessary to preview and review and practice more homework. Let the soldiers preview the text before class, so that they can pay special attention to listening when the instructor lectures. Because the soldiers are all young adults with poor memory, they can only consolidate what they have learned by reviewing more. Practicing more homework can overcome the phenomenon that soldiers can recognize but not write, and can write but not use in cultural learning. At the same time, attention should also be paid to strengthening the revision of homework, and compositions can be discussed in mutual aid groups first, revised by themselves, and then corrected by the instructors. The instructors should pay attention to correcting more and changing less, and often introduce good and bad works for everyone to discuss, so as to improve writing ability. Fourth, organize mutual aid groups and promote mutual teaching and mutual learning. It is more appropriate to organize mutual aid groups within the same cultural learning group. Because the study time is consistent and the curriculum is consistent within the same group, the purpose of mutual supervision and mutual assistance can be achieved. The central tasks of the mutual aid group are to jointly study the central ideas and difficult problems of the text, dictate and join sentences to each other, and check and revise homework to each other.

    总结文化学习
    主要经验：开好教育准备会；制定教案；少讲，多练习。
    【本报讯】东北消息：东北军区政治部顷总结该区部队文化教育工作，得出初步经验如下：一、必须把教育准备会开好。因为目前部队中文化教员程度较低，工作经验缺乏，把准备会开好，对改进教学方法和提高教员工作能力作用很大。准备会的内容应该是：确定一周课程进度、研究课文中心及疑难问题、研究教案及教学方法。要把准备会开好，必须做到：（一）开会以前，部队的团政治处应将研究中心通知文化教员，使他们能够预先搜集材料，考虑问题，准备意见。部队教育工作的领导同志要对连队文化教育工作的情况求得充分了解，以便在会中提出中心问题。（二）每次开会要有中心，目的在解决当前的主要问题。如目前的主要问题是教员不会做教案，则以研究教案如何做法为中心。不应该把准备会开成一般的汇报会议，使主要问题得不到很好解决。（三）开会时要大家当学生大家当先生，避免领导者向教员“上大课”的方式。应由大家提问题，大家研究，最后领导同志作总结。或指定一人介绍自己的经验，让大家讨论，最后作出总结。采取这样的群众路线的办法，会开得活泼，问题也解决得深刻。二、文化教员对他所教的每门功课，必须制定教案，使教学工作在有计划有准备的情况下进行。制定教案时应注意：（一）教案的主要内容应包括课文中心及教学目的，讲课方法、步骤及时间的分配，练习的内容及方法。国文课应加上生字，生词的解释。（二）应从实际情况出发，要根据不同的组不同的课文做出不同的教案，不应千篇一律。要根据战士的接受程度而不是根据教员知道的多少去制定。三、教学方法上应注意的几个问题：（一）讲解和练习的问题。要做到讲解的分量少，练习的时间多（一般应占学习时间三分之二，至少亦须占二分之一）。讲解首先要注意讲得正确。如有的教员讲：“秦始皇是帝国主义，农民是无产阶级，那时无产阶级没有共产党领导，结果失败了”。这就是讲得不正确。其次要讲的简单明了。如给初学算术的人讲课，不要一开始就讲公式法则，应告诉他简单的算法。会算了再讲法则、公式的道理，这样才易于理解。在练习方面，低年级的战士，应注重听写、联句、改错别字。其中以听写的效果最大。据某师测验，实行听写练习的一个连队，答对百分之九十七点五，未实行听写的只答对百分之五十三点五。高年级的战士，应注意提高写作能力，多练习写话、写日记，有了基础后再练习写文章。讲文法必须和作业结合起来。作文评讲就是讲文法的最好方式。（二）注意启发诱导和进行实物与图画教学。因战士都是青年或壮年，理解力较强。教员应注意随时启发战士用脑子想问题，由他们提出问题并练习自己解答。凡是经过战士考虑过的问题，最后由教员归纳解答，教育效果就大得多。另外，对一般战士的教学方法，应该是由具体到抽象，由浅到深，由近到远。实物和图画教学，可以帮助战士易于理解问题。（三）要预习和复习及多练习作业。课前让战士预习课文，在教员讲课时他们就能特别注意听讲。因为战士都是青壮年，记忆力较差，只有多复习，才能巩固学过的东西。多练习作业，可以克服战士在学文化中能认不能写、能写不能用的现象。同时，还要注意加强作业的修改，作文可先在互助组讨论，经本人修改后再由教员批改。教员应注意多批少改、并经常介绍好与坏的作品给大家讨论，借以提高写作能力。四、组织互助组，提倡互教互学。互助组以在同一文化学习组内组织为较恰当。因为同一组内，学习时间一致，课程一致，可以达到互相督促、互相帮助的目的。互助组的中心任务是共同研究课文中心及疑难问题，互相听写、联句，及互相检查、修改作业。
