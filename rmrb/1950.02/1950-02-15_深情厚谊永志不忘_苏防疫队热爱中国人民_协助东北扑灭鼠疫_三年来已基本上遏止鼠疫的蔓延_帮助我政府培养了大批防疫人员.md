Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 13th. The Soviet anti-epidemic team's work in assisting the Northeast People's Government in eradicating the plague in various regions has resulted in an unprecedented reduction in the mortality rate of the plague in the Northeast over the past three years, basically curbing the spread of the plague. The high degree of internationalist spirit and selfless service enthusiasm demonstrated by the team's staff in the anti-epidemic work has left an indelible impression on the people of Northeast China.

On the eve of the Soviet Red Army's liberation of Northeast China, Japanese war criminals, in an attempt to cover up their crimes of engaging in bacteriological warfare, destroyed several germ-manufacturing factories they had established in the Northeast, spreading various disease germs to various regions, causing the people of Northeast China to suffer from epidemics such as plague, typhoid fever, cholera, and livestock anthrax for many years. The plague, in particular, was most rampant in 1947. At that time, the plague spread to 18 cities and counties, a total of 630 villages, with 23,171 people infected with the plague and dying. Therefore, the former Northeast Administrative Committee invited the Soviet anti-epidemic team to come and assist in the eradication of the plague. In the three years from 1947 to 1949, the Soviet Red Cross and Red Crescent Society sent anti-epidemic teams to work in the plague-stricken areas of Northeast China every year. The Soviet anti-epidemic team included dozens of people, including anti-epidemic experts, anti-epidemic workers, disinfectors, and nurses. The anti-epidemic equipment, medicines, laboratory instruments, hospital equipment, patient food, special vehicles for transporting patients, and other tools and materials related to anti-epidemic work were all brought from the Soviet Union. In May 1949, before the plague was discovered in Northeast China, the team assisted our People's Government's health authorities in carrying out planned and organized anti-epidemic vaccination work, and organized rat-catching teams to go to various places to conduct investigations, research, and propaganda work, mobilizing the people to catch rats, plug holes, kill fleas, and eliminate the breeding medium of the plague, thus significantly reducing the occurrence of the plague. According to statistics, in 1947, there were a total of 30,326 plague patients in Northeast China, which decreased to 5,947 in 1948, and further decreased to 417 in 1949. The number of deaths due to the plague also decreased to only 250, among which the mortality rate of those treated by the Soviet anti-epidemic team was about 20%, which was rare in previous years. In addition to carrying out prevention and control work, the team also helped the Northeast People's Government train a large number of anti-epidemic work cadres, who are now able to apply new methods of anti-epidemic treatment. The team also donated more than 260 kinds of anti-epidemic equipment and medicines to the Health Department of the Northeast People's Government, helping to solve the difficulty of lacking equipment.

Selfless Service Enthusiasm Earns the Sincere Respect and Gratitude of the People of Northeast China

The Soviet anti-epidemic team demonstrated a high degree of service enthusiasm in the process of preventing and controlling the plague. As soon as the team received news of the discovery of the plague, even if the epidemic area was in a rural area with extremely difficult transportation, they immediately rushed to carry out emergency work. When the plague first broke out in the Tongliao area last year, the team's chief representative, Maisky, immediately mobilized the people to take isolation and thorough disinfection steps, so that the plague that had already occurred in the area was extinguished after only one or two people were infected. The team showed unparalleled care and concern for plague patients. Regardless of the severity of the patient's condition, the medical staff personally examined and treated them, gave patients haircuts, baths, changed clothes, and even fed them, taking extremely good care of them; and often used various methods to comfort patients in order to reduce their pain. They paid special attention to the nutrition of patients, providing them with meat, fish, and fruits every day. Sometimes, the team staff even gave their own food to the patients.

The high degree of service enthusiasm of the team staff has won the sincere respect and gratitude of the people of Northeast China. The Chinese medical staff and the people in the epidemic area who participated in the team's work were particularly deeply moved. Patients who suffered from plague infection and recovered their health with the help of the Soviet anti-epidemic team generally regarded the anti-epidemic personnel of the team as their closest benefactors. The people in the Rehe epidemic area called the team's squad leader, Khekherova, "the mother of rebirth." When the Soviet anti-epidemic team completed its mission and returned home, the people in the epidemic area were reluctant to part with them, and sent them off in groups along the way. The farmers' associations, women's federations, and children's groups in Rehe alone sent more than 800 letters of condolences to the team and presented more than 60 kinds of gifts.

　　深情厚谊永志不忘
    苏防疫队热爱中国人民         
    协助东北扑灭鼠疫
    三年来已基本上遏止鼠疫的蔓延  
    帮助我政府培养了大批防疫人员
    【新华社沈阳十三日电】苏联防疫队帮助东北人民政府扑灭各地鼠疫的工作，使三年来东北鼠疫的死亡率空前降低，基本上遏止了鼠疫的蔓延。该队工作人员在防疫工作中所表现的高度国际主义精神和忘我的服务热忱，留给东北人民一个永不磨灭的印象。
    在苏联红军解放东北前夕，日本战犯为企图掩盖其从事细菌战争的罪行而将他们在东北地区所建立的几处制造细菌工厂加以破坏的过程中，曾将各种疫病细菌散播各地，使东北人民连年遭受了鼠疫、伤寒、霍乱和牲畜炭疽病等传染病的灾害。特别是鼠疫，在一九四七年最为猖獗。当时鼠疫蔓延地区广达十八个市、县，共六百三十个村屯，被传染鼠疫而死亡者达二万三千一百七十一人。因此前东北行政委员会便邀请苏联防疫队前来协助扑灭鼠疫工作。在一九四七年到一九四九年的三年中，苏联红军十字半月协会每年都派遣防疫队前来东北疫区工作。苏联的防疫队包括防疫专家、防疫员、消毒员、护士等数十人。他们应用的防疫器材、药品、化验仪器、病院设备和病人食物、接送病人专用的交通工具等以及其他与防疫有关的工具材料都是从苏联带来的。一九四九年五月，在东北尚未发现鼠疫之前，该队即协助我人民政府卫生机关进行了有计划有组织的防疫注射工作，并组织捕鼠队分赴各地进行调查研究和宣传工作，发动人民捕鼠、堵洞、灭蚤以及消灭鼠疫繁殖媒介，因而显著地减少了鼠疫发生的现象。据统计，一九四七年全东北鼠疫患者共达三万零三百二十六人，一九四八年减少为五千九百四十七人，一九四九年更减至四百十七人，因患鼠疫死亡的人数也减低到只有二百五十人，其中经过苏联防疫队诊治的，其死亡率约为百分之二十，为历年所罕见。该队除进行防治工作以外，并帮助东北人民政府培养了大批防疫工作干部，这些干部现在都能够应用新的防疫治疗的方法。该队并赠给东北人民政府卫生部防疫器材药品等二百六十多种，帮助解决了器材缺乏的困难。
    忘我的服务热忱获得东北人民衷心的敬佩和感激
    苏联防疫队在防治鼠疫的工作过程中，表现了高度的服务热忱。该队只要接到发现鼠疫的消息，即使疫区是在交通极端困难的乡村中，也立即赶往进行急救工作。通辽地区去年刚发生鼠疫时，该队总代表马意斯基迅即发动人民采取隔离和彻底消毒的步骤，使该地区已经发生的鼠疫只在有一、二人被传染后即告扑灭。该队对鼠疫病人表现了无比的爱护和关心。不论病人的病情轻重，医务工作人员都亲自诊查、治疗，替病人理发、洗澡、换衣以至喂饭，照顾极为周到；并经常用各种方法安慰病人，以减少其痛苦。他们对病人营养特别注意，每天都供给肉、鱼和水果等食物，有时候该队工作人员还把自己的食物送给病人吃。
    该队工作人员这种高度的服务热忱，获得东北人民衷心的敬佩和感激。参加该队工作的中国医务人员和疫区人民，所受感动尤深。身受鼠疫传染的病人因为得到苏联防疫队的帮助而恢复了健康，更普遍地把该队防疫人员视为至亲的恩人。热河疫区人民都把该队的分队长赫赫洛娃称为“再生的母亲”。当苏联防疫队完成任务回国时，疫区人民都依依不舍，沿途成群结队相送。仅热河的农会、妇女会、儿童团等团体，给该队的慰问信即达八百多封，赠送礼品达六十多种。
