Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, February 10th: After a relatively comprehensive inspection since last November, state-owned factories and mines in North China have found the main path to improve business management, and have begun to see practical results in their work. The inspection found that the main problems hindering further improvement in production in North China's factories and mines are the lack of experience in scientific management of enterprises among the leaders of many factories and mines, and the failure to clearly recognize the importance of relying on the consciousness of the working class to run enterprises well.

Many factories lack scientific management methods and systems

During this inspection, it was found that many factories and mines lack scientific management methods and systems, resulting in a large amount of capital being stockpiled or wasted, low production efficiency, high finished product costs, and few sales channels. The production of some factories lacks strict planning, forming a phenomenon of separation between production and sales. The state-owned alcohol factory in Chahar Province produced 25,000 catties in October last year, but only sold 150 catties in the same month. The stock of the glass factory can also be sold for a year. After the province's former military factories turned to peaceful production, they failed to solve the problem of production targets in a timely manner, resulting in very little work for more than 200 lathes. More generally, many factories lack strict management and inspection systems in production management, and there are many unreasonable phenomena in production. Due to a lack of responsibility during acquisition and poor storage by the Tianjin North China Oil and Fat Company, 2.6 million catties of spoiled oil were stored in vegetable oil. The company did not purchase materials through state-owned trading organizations, but instead purchased from speculative merchants, resulting in an additional cost of nearly 10 million yuan. The internal business connections of the company were not close, and the transportation of materials was not timely, resulting in an extra expenditure of more than 3 million yuan at one time, and a fine of more than 5 million yuan for delaying the unloading of railway cars due to occupancy. Due to lax inspection, the rejection rate of cast iron pots at the Datong Machine Factory reached one-third. In the state-owned enterprises of Chahar, it was also found that many factories did not have a strict system of dedicated personnel responsible and inspection. In production, the load of the provincial power plant's motors only reached one-third, and electricity loss accounted for 30% of the power generation. The cigarette factory had dozens of surplus workers due to unreasonable labor organization. Poor safety equipment in many places and frequent disasters are also mainly due to the lack of strict and effective management inspection systems. There were three consecutive fires in Datong in October last year. In addition, some people doing enterprise leadership work shout empty slogans of "political leadership" without seriously learning production technology and business, and still do not know how to manage production.

Many leaders have not consciously relied on the working class to implement democratic management

Another important reason hindering further improvement in production is that the leaders of many factories and mines have not consciously relied on the working class to implement the policy of democratic management. Last year, many factories and mines established factory management committees, but these organizations rarely played a role in concentrating the opinions and wisdom of the workers to improve production. Some management committees rarely prepare before meetings, and the factory director or manager talks about his own set of ideas during the meeting. Other representatives do not speak. The resolutions passed are often not realized. Therefore, the workers lack a sense of ownership, and their enthusiasm and creativity have not been fully utilized. When the Xinji City Leather Factory in Hebei Province made leather shafts, the factory director did not humbly accept the workers' opinions, resulting in the finished products being unsalable, and a loss of more than 200,000 catties of millet. The leaders of a factory in Wu'an, Pingyuan Province, mistakenly classified young workers as "active elements" and elderly workers as "backward elements," resulting in the isolation of active elements and the disconnection between leaders and the masses. Shanxi, Chahar, and other places all found during inspections that the factory side did not consult with the workers when making production plans, but simply blamed the workers for being backward. In some factories and mines, the lives and welfare of the workers have not received the due attention of the leaders. In particular, the existence of bureaucracy among the leaders of some factories and mines has further increased the severity of the above problems. For example, the managers of the Huyi and Zhangcun coal mines in Neiqiu County and Shahe County in Hebei Province did not even know how much coal the two mines produced each day.

Problems are immediately solved, and production work is improved

The main industrial and mining areas in North China, such as Beijing, Tianjin, Taiyuan, and Chahar, were liberated successively last year. Over the past year, after takeover, rectification, and worker organization and education, significant achievements have been made in restoring production, and many factories and mines have exceeded the pre-liberation level. However, in order to improve on the existing basis, it is necessary to first solve the problems found in this inspection. Recently, the factories and mines have made preliminary improvements in this regard, immediately solving the problems that have been discovered, and gradually formulating or improving some systems. After discovering 20,000 enemy-buried grenades and a large number of detonators and explosives near the factory site during the inspection, two factories in Taiyuan immediately transferred them. After discovering a mine threatened by methane gas during the inspection of the Huyi Coal Mine in Neiqiu, it immediately suspended mining. According to the inspection results, the Taiyuan Tobacco Company formulated regulations on rewards and punishments, quality inspection, and leave application; Yangquan No. 4 Mine formulated regulations on machine safety standards, security rewards and punishments, and specific division of labor for each department. After this inspection, a new atmosphere has emerged in the production work of many factories and mines. Due to the timely improvement and reorganization of the trade union organizations during the inspection and the partial solution of workers' welfare problems, the production volume of three poorly performing coal mines in Hebei Province increased by 50% to 100% within 20 days. In December, the yarn production of the Jin Sheng Yarn Factory in Taiyuan increased by 12.6% in half a month compared with the same period before the inspection, and the rate of substandard cloth decreased from 15.9% in November to 2.9% in December. After the inspection, the daily output of the Taiyuan Flour Mill jumped from the standard quota of 1,200 bags to 1,560 bags. The daily output of cloth at the Jinhua Textile Factory also increased by 220 pieces after the inspection. In addition, new records in the production or quality of various products have also continued to appear in various production units.

The broad masses of workers actively participate in inspection work

The main reason why this inspection has achieved such significant results in improving production is that the broad masses of workers actively participated in the inspection work. Some employees of state-owned factories and mines in Shanxi held a wait-and-see attitude at the beginning of the inspection. The reason was that their opinions had not been valued in the past. After the factory administration and trade union leaders made self-criticisms to everyone, the enthusiasm of the workers to participate in the inspection was brought into play. The employees of six units, including the Taiyuan Flour Company, put forward more than 1,600 opinions during this inspection. The workers who participated in this general inspection at the Jinhua Textile Factory accounted for 93% of the total number of workers. After this inspection, the unity of employees in the Handan Fuchang Flour Mill has been enhanced; the workers have transformed the expansion ring on the engine, and the daily output of flour has increased from 700 bags to 900 bags. In the past, it took four days to wash a boiler at the Baoding Power Plant. Now, because the method has been improved, it only takes eight hours each time, saving 1,000 catties of millet.

After this inspection, the leadership of the local people's government over state-owned industrial and mining enterprises has also begun to be strengthened. Chahar Province has re-equipped and strengthened the cadres of factories and mines, and decided to establish an industrial and mining work committee to strengthen the management of industrial and mining production.

At present, the work of improving business management in various industrial and mining areas in North China is still in its initial stage. Systematically and step-by-step solving the key problems in enterprise management that hinder production development based on the results of this inspection will effectively improve industrial and mining production in North China.

### 华北公营工厂大检查效果良好  发现阻碍生产提高关键  开始改善经营管理工作

　　华北公营工厂大检查效果良好
    发现阻碍生产提高关键  开始改善经营管理工作
    【新华社北京十日电】经过去年十一月以来一次比较普遍的检查以后，华北各地公营厂矿已找到了改善经营管理工作的主要门径，并且在工作中开始收到了实际效果。这次检查发现目前阻碍华北工矿生产进一步提高的主要问题是不少厂矿的领导人员缺乏科学的经营管理企业的经验和没有明确认识到依靠工人阶级的觉悟来办好企业的重要意义。
    许多工厂缺乏科学的经营管理方法和制度
    在这次检查中，发现许多厂矿由于缺乏科学的经营管理方法和制度，以致大量资金被积压或被浪费，生产效率低，成品成本高，销路少。有些工厂的生产缺乏严密的计划性，形成产销脱节的现象。察哈尔省营的酒精厂去年十月份产量为二万五千斤，但同月仅销一百五十斤。料器厂的存货也可卖一年。该省过去的军工工厂转向和平生产后，因没有及时地解决生产对象问题，结果二百多部车床很少有活做。而更为普遍的是不少工厂在生产管理上缺乏严密的管理制度和检查制度，生产中存在着很多不合理现象。天津华北油脂公司由于收购时责任心不强、保管不善等原因，储存的植物油中坏油达二百六十多万斤。该公司没有经过公营贸易机构购买材料，反而向投机商人购买，结果多费资金近一千万元。该公司内部业务联系不密切，搬运物资不能及时，以致一次多花钱租三百多万元，一次因压占车皮延期卸货被罚五百多万元。因检查不严，大同机器厂铸造铁锅废品达三分之一。在察哈尔公营企业中，也发现许多工厂没有严格的专人负责制与检查制。在生产中，省营发电厂电机负荷量仅达三分之一，经常去电损失亦占发电量百分之三十。纸烟厂因劳动组织不合理，剩余工人亦有数十人。许多地方安全设备不良，灾祸事件时常发生，其重要原因之一也是由于缺乏严格的有效的管理检查制度所致。大同一地去年十月份中即连续发生火灾三起。此外有些做企业领导工作的人员空喊“政治领导”，没有认真学习生产技术和业务，至今尚不会管理生产。
    不少领导人员没有自觉地依靠工人阶级实行民主管理
    阻碍生产进一步提高的另一重要原因，是不少厂矿的领导人员没有自觉地依靠工人阶级，实行管理民主化的方针。去年各地曾有不少厂矿建立了工厂管理委员会，但这些组织中很少能真正地起了集中工人群众意见和智慧来改进生产的作用。有些管委会在开会前很少准备，开会时厂长或经理把自己的一套谈谈。别的代表不说话。通过的决议常不能实现。因此工人群众缺少主人翁的感觉，他们的积极性创造性没有充分发挥出来。河北辛集市皮革厂作皮轴时，厂长不虚心接受工人意见，结果成品卖不出，损失小米二十多万斤。平原省武安一个工厂的领导人错误地把青年工人划为“积极分子”，把老年工人划为“落后分子”，结果，积极分子孤立，领导与群众脱节。山西、察哈尔等地都在检查中发现厂方在订生产计划时不和工人商量而单纯责备工人落后的现象。在若干厂矿中工人生活和福利也未引起领导人员的应有注意。特别是由于某些厂矿的领导人员中存在着官僚主义的作风，更增加了上述问题的严重程度。如河北省内邱县胡峪和沙河县章村两煤矿的经理甚至不知道两矿每天出多少煤。
    发现问题立即解决生产工作提高一步
    华北的主要工矿区如京、津、太原、察哈尔等地系于去年先后解放。一年来经过接管、整顿以及进行了工人的组织教育等工作，在恢复生产上已获得显著成绩，不少厂矿且已超过解放前水平。但是要想在现有基础上提高一步，就必须首先解决这次检查中所发现的问题。最近以来，各厂矿已在这方面有了初步的改进，对已发现问题予以立即解决，并逐渐订立或健全了若干制度。太原曾有两个工厂在这次检查中发现厂址附近有敌人埋置的二万颗手榴弹和大批雷管、炸药后，已立刻进行了转移。内邱胡峪煤矿检查中发现了有被沼气威胁的矿井，于是立即暂停开采。太原烟草公司根据检查结果，订出了奖惩、质量检查、请假等制度；阳泉四矿则订了机器安全标准、保安奖惩、各股具体分工等制度。经过这次检查，不少厂矿的生产工作已出现了新的气象。河北省三个工作较差的煤矿由于在检查中及时地健全和改组了工会组织，部分解决了工人福利问题，生产量在二十天内即提高了百分之五十到百分之一百。太原晋生纱厂十二月内半个月的产纱量，较检查前同一期间增加了百分之十二点六，次布率则由十一月份的百分之十五点九降低到十二月的百分之二点九。太原面粉厂的产量，在检查后日产量由一千二百袋的标准定额，一跃而为一千五百六十袋。晋华纺织厂的布匹日产量经过检查亦增加二百二十匹。此外，多样的产品的产量或质量的新纪录，也在各生产单位不断出现了。
    广大职工积极参加检查工作
    这次检查对于改进生产能获得如此重大的效果，主要原因是广大工人积极地参加了检查工作。山西的公营厂矿的部分职工，在开始检查时曾抱着观望态度。原因是过去他们的意见没有被重视。后经工厂行政、工会负责人员向大家作了检讨，工人参加检查的积极性才发挥出来。太原面粉公司等六个单位的职工在这次检查中提出的意见即达一千六百多件。晋华纺织厂参加这次大检查的工人占全体工人总数的百分之九十三。邯郸复昌面粉厂从这次检查后，职工团结增进了；工人改造了引擎上的涨圈，面粉日产量由七百袋增到九百袋。保定发电厂过去洗刷一次锅炉需四天时间，现在因为办法改进了，每次只需八小时，可节省小米一千斤。
    经过这次检查，地方人民政府对公营工矿企业的领导也开始加强。察哈尔省已重新配备和加强了厂矿的干部，并决定建立工矿工作委员会，加强对工矿生产的管理。
    目前华北各地工矿改进经营管理的工作还在开始。根据这次检查结果，系统地有步骤地解决阻碍生产发展的企业管理中的关键问题，将使华北工矿业生产切实地提高一步。
