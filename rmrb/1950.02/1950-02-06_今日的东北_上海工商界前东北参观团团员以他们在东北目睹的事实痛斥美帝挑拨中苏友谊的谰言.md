Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 4th. Hu Jue-wen, the head of the Shanghai industrial and commercial circles’ former Northeast visiting delegation, deputy head Yu Huan-cheng, and members Wei Ru, Liu Yan, Wang Yi and others made statements in the News Daily on the 1st, refuting the shameless slanders of the US State Department and Acheson, which were aimed at sowing discord in Sino-Soviet friendship, based on the facts they witnessed in the Northeast.

Hu Jue-wen said: We personally went to the Northeast last year for investigation, and we saw with our own eyes that even in Lushun and Dalian, where Soviet troops were stationed, the local administration was managed by the Chinese themselves. There was absolutely no phenomenon of Soviet interference in China's internal affairs throughout the Northeast region. In the factories, Soviet technicians not only did not infringe upon our rights, but also actively assisted us technically and enthusiastically guided us. We personally witnessed that Soviet friends and local people got along very harmoniously and affectionately.

Yu Huan-cheng said: In Dalian, we saw that the municipal construction was very well done, and the restoration of factories and the increase of agricultural production were also very effective. In this regard, Soviet friends made great contributions. But they only provided opinions and methods to make our construction better and more successful, and did not interfere in our internal affairs.

Wei Ru, general manager of Xinzhong Engineering Company, said: Today's Northeast is filled with the atmosphere of industrial construction everywhere. Everyone is busy with production and construction. The industries in Dalian, Shenyang, Harbin and other places are manufacturing locomotives, machine tools, mine rails and mechanized agricultural implements, and the products are all related to peaceful construction. In enterprises in the Northeast, administrative and management personnel are all Chinese. Even if Soviet experts are employed, they never interfere in factory management except for technical matters. Absolutely no facts can be found in the Northeast that Soviet Union controls and operates industrial equipment. As for the so-called mining rights, this is even more of a fabrication.

Liu Yan, manager of Shanghai Jianhua Transportation Company, said: 100% of the land transportation and water traffic in the entire Northeast are under the unified leadership of the Northeast Railway Bureau, the Highway Bureau and the Shipping Bureau, directly under the Northeast People's Government, and under the unified leadership of the ministries of the Central People's Government. This is an ironclad fact. In the context of the highly advanced Sino-Soviet friendship, all the absurd rumors of the American imperialism only serve to prove the American imperialism's baseness and shamelessness.

Wang Yi, an accountant at Zhengming Accounting Firm, said: We saw with our own eyes that the Lushun-Dalian area was completely under the jurisdiction of the Chinese Lushun-Dalian Administrative Office. There were no beggars and no unemployment there. We all agreed that Lushun-Dalian was an area with achievements in new democratic construction.

Tu Kaizheng, general manager of Jicheng Pharmacy, said: As a result of our free visits everywhere in the Northeast, we did not find a single ruble bill in the Northeast. Even when Soviet comrades used money, they used Northeast currency or Kwantung currency. This is also evidence of the Soviet Union's respect for China's territorial sovereignty and integrity.

Chen He, general manager of Min'an Insurance Company, said: The Northeast currency is issued by the Northeast People's Bank, and the Kwantung currency in the Lushun-Dalian area is issued by the Kwantung Bank, all of which are completely and uniformly issued by the Northeast People's Government. There is only one Soviet friendly Far East Bank in the Northeast, but its business scope is very limited, only handling remittances between Soviet expatriates and their home country, and no Chinese people deposit a penny there. This is fundamentally different from the British and American imperialist banks such as the Mercantile Bank and the HSBC.

Chen Fenghao, general manager of Zhonghua Pharmaceutical Company, said: The medicines needed in the Northeast, which cannot be supplied domestically for the time being, are exchanged from the Soviet Union through trade organizations in the form of barter. We take the initiative to decide what medicines are needed, and there is no phenomenon of dumping of American medicines like the overwhelming influx of American goods into Shanghai after the victory of the Anti-Japanese War.

Song Baolin, general manager of Dacheng Silk Factory, said: Only after traveling to the Northeast can one truly appreciate that the relations between the Soviet Union and China are truly based on the principle of equality and mutual benefit. Taking Sino-Soviet trade as an example, Northeast's trade with the Soviet Union is to exchange the surplus products of the Northeast for the machinery, equipment and raw materials urgently needed for the development of heavy industry.

Jin Dazhong, manager of Dingtai Steamboat Timber Company, and Xu Yongyan, assistant manager of Jiangnan Paper Mill, both pointed out that the Soviet experts hired to work in China were unwilling to receive any special treatment, and only enjoyed the same treatment as Chinese technicians. Xu Yongyan said: The shameless rumors of the US State Department and Acheson can absolutely not shake the friendship between China and the Soviet Union.

　　今日的东北
    上海工商界前东北参观团团员以他们在东北目睹的事实痛斥美帝挑拨中苏友谊的谰言
    【新华社上海四日电】上海工商界前东北参观团团长胡厥文，副团长俞寰澄及团员魏如、刘炎、汪怡等一日在新闻日报发表谈话，根据他们在东北目睹的事实，驳斥美国国务院和艾奇逊挑拨中苏友谊的无耻谰言。
    胡厥文说：我们曾经在去年亲到东北去考察，我们亲眼看到，就是在苏联有驻军的旅顺、大连，当地的行政也是由中国人自己来管理的。在整个东北地区，绝无苏联人干涉中国内政的现象。在工厂中，苏联技术人员不但没有侵犯我们的权利，而且在技术上积极协助我们，热心指导我们。我们曾亲睹苏联朋友和当地人民相处，十分和洽、亲爱。
    俞寰澄说：在大连，我们看到市政建设办得极好，恢复工厂，增加农业生产，也很见效。在这方面，苏联朋友的贡献极大。但他们只是提供意见、方法，使我们的建设能做得更好，更有成绩，并未干涉我们的内政。
    新中工程公司总经理魏如说：今日的东北，处处都呼吸到工业建设的气息。人人都在忙着生产和建设。大连、沈阳、哈尔滨等地的工业所制造的是机车、工作母机、矿场铁轨和机械化的农具，生产的东西都是与和平建设有关的。在东北的企业中，行政和管理人员完全都是中国人，就是聘有苏联专家，他们除了技术之外，也从不干涉工厂管理。在东北绝对找不到苏联控制并经营工业设备的任何事实。至于所谓采矿权，这更是无中生有的造谣。
    上海建华建运公司经理刘炎说：全东北的陆路运输和水上交通，百分之百都掌握在东北铁路总局、公路总局和航运总局的统一领导下，直辖于东北人民政府，并且接受中央人民政府各部统一领导，这是铁一般的事实。在中苏友谊的高度进展中，一切美帝的荒谬谣言，更足以证明美帝的卑鄙无耻。
    正明会计事务所会计师汪怡说：我们亲眼看见旅大地区完全是在中国旅大行署的统辖之下。那儿没有乞丐，没有失业。我们一致认为旅大是新民主主义建设有成绩的地区。
    集成药房总经理屠开征说：我们在东北到处自由参观的结果，在东北没有发现一张卢布票，就是苏联同志用钱，也是用的东北币或关东币。这也是苏联尊重中国领土主权完整的一个证据。
    民安保险公司总经理陈鹤说：东北币由东北人民银行发行，旅大地区的关东币由关东银行发行，那都是完完全全由东北人民政府统一发行的。在东北只有一家苏联友邦的远东银行，但他的业务范围限制很严，只做苏联侨民对本国的往来汇兑，没有一个中国人在那儿存一个钱。这和英美帝国主义的麦加利、汇丰等银行是本质上完全不同的。
    中华制药公司总经理陈丰镐说：东北需用的药品，凡为国内暂时不能供应的，均经过贸易机构以易货方式向苏联交换而来，需要什么药品完全由我们主动决定，毫无上海在抗战胜利之后美货药品排山倒海而来的倾销现象。
    大诚绸厂总经理宋保林说：只有亲身旅行东北之后，才真正体会到苏联和中国的邦交是真正基于平等互惠的原则的。就以中苏贸易来说，东北和苏联的贸易，是把东北剩余的产品向苏联换来发展重工业所急需的机器设备和原料。
    鼎泰轮船木材公司经理金达中和江南造纸厂襄理徐庸言，都指出被聘来华的苏联专家都不愿受任何特殊的优待，只享受和中国技术人员一样的待遇。徐庸言说：美国务院和艾奇逊的无耻谣言，绝对不能动摇中苏间的友谊。
