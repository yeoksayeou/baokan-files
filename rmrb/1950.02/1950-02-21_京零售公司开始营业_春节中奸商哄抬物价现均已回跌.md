　　Beijing Retail Company Opens for Business
    Profiteering by Merchants During Spring Festival Now Declines
    [Beijing News] The Beijing Retail Company opened for business on the 19th (the third day of the Lunar New Year). During the Spring Festival, a few unscrupulous merchants took the opportunity to raise prices. White flour rose from 2,400 yuan per jin to 2,800 yuan, and millet flour rose from 1,400 yuan per jin to 2,000 yuan. After the retail store opened for business, white flour fell from 2,800 yuan per jin back to 2,400 yuan, and millet flour fell from 2,000 yuan per jin to 1,600 yuan, dealing a blow to the unscrupulous merchants. Grain prices have almost returned to pre-Spring Festival levels.
