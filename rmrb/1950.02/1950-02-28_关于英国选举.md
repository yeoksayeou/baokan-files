　　On the British Election
　　Ai Hong
    The recent British general election has created a new situation in modern British political history, namely, it has almost created a parliamentary deadlock. In the last parliament, the Labor Party members occupied nearly twice as many seats as the Conservative Party headed by Churchill. But today, this majority has disappeared, and the Labor Party has only a small handful more seats than their political enemies. Labor leaders believe that a majority of thirty seats is the minimum number to make the parliamentary political machine work, but this time the Labor Party obtained far less than thirty seats.
    The once powerful Liberal Party attempted a major revival this time, but failed, gaining only nine seats. All five Labor independents in the previous parliament were defeated. The two Communist MPs, Piratin and Gallacher, were also not elected, so that the Communist Party has no representation in Parliament.
    The new parliamentary seats are as follows (results of five elections have not yet been announced):
              1950      1945
　　Labor      315          393
　　Conservative    294          213
　　Liberal    9              12
　　Communist    1              2
　　Other (not yet published)    7              20
    The voting situation is as follows:
              1950        1945
　　Labor      13,209,400      11,967,985
　　Conservative    12,408,807      9,847,222
　　Liberal    2,610,272        2,227,400
　　Communist    91,746    102,780
    Eighty-four percent of Britain's 34 million voters voted, the highest voting record in British history.
    This election result solves none of Britain's problems. The new government that Attlee intends to form is unlikely to be a stable government. After a period of stopgap measures, new elections will probably be inevitable, otherwise the right-wing Labor leaders will openly deal with Churchill. Because, in the coming period, the current Labor government will be under great pressure from the Conservative Party and American imperialism on the one hand, and due to the deepening of the British economic crisis, will be subjected to the growing demands of the workers to take anti-capitalist measures on the other.
    The general election was held under conditions of expanding capitalist crisis, and as in the entire capitalist world, the economic crisis can by no means be solved by Marshall "aid," devaluation, attacks on workers' lives, and the people of the colonies.
    Why in this election, did the Conservative Party gain so many votes, the Labor Party suffer heavy losses, and the Communist Party—the only party that put forward a policy to solve the problems of the British masses—fail to gain a single seat in the House of Commons?
    The Conservative Party, the tool of powerful monopoly capitalists and the controller of all major propaganda tools in Britain, launched a long offensive against the Labor government. Their aim is restoration, as has happened in other countries controlled by American imperialism, such as France, Italy, Belgium, Australia, and New Zealand, where openly right-wing parties have been put in power, and the Communist Party has suffered heavy attacks.
    This is not because the big capitalists are afraid of people like Attlee and Bevin. Far from it, Attlee and Bevin are implementing purely capitalist policies disguised as deceptive "socialist" rhetoric. However, the policies of the Labor leaders have met with increasing resistance from the trade union movement, and the Conservative Party is worried that when the workers' struggle intensifies (which will intensify as the economic crisis further expands), the Labor Party's deceptive tricks will not be able to suppress the growing mass discontent.
    For example, on January 12, the day after the announcement of the general election, a national conference of the executive committees of British trade unions represented the growing dissatisfaction of the masses, almost causing the government's policy of recommending a wage freeze in the face of high prices to fail. The Labor cabinet was shocked because it had hoped that this national conference would unanimously approve this reactionary policy. But at the Trade Union Congress in September last year, despite the firm opposition of the Communist Party, a majority of 5.5 million people expressed support for this so-called "wage freeze" measure. In January, after only four months, on the eve of the election, the number of people supporting the "wage freeze" had dropped to 750,000. It was as a result of the increasing influence of the Communist Party that workers in many important industries decided not to support this reactionary policy.
    The great efforts made by the Conservative Party for restoration, coupled with the vivid memories of the suffering the people experienced under their rule, have caused confusion among some people. The broad masses of the people, on the one hand, fear the Conservative Party coming to power, but on the other hand, they see that the Labor Party's policies on major issues are the same as those of the Conservative Party, such as the Atlantic Pact, the Marshall Plan, anti-Soviet conspiracies, colonial wars, "wage freezes," the continued presence of American troops in Britain, maintaining bourgeois rule, suppressing the Communist Party, and huge military expenditures.
    All these policies directly violate the promises made by the Labor Party to the people in its 1945 election platform. If the Labor leaders had been faithful to their promises, cooperated with the Soviet Union in friendship, striven for peace, and vigorously attacked the monopoly capitalists, then the workers and the middle class would have continued to trust the Labor Party and made any resurgence of the Conservative Party impossible. It is precisely because the Labor Party leaders have desperately attacked the fighting workers and the Communist Party, and acted as pawns of American imperialism, that this crime of betraying the working class has led to the growth of the Conservative Party's power. The Conservative Party failed to come to power in this election, not because the Labor government has the support of the people, but because the industrial workers still have a deep traditional hatred for the Conservative Party, the class party of British imperialism. It is precisely because the Communist Party has consistently led the struggle against the Conservative Party, and carried out an independent election campaign in this election, that the reactionary leader Churchill failed to restore his power.
    What is the reason why the Communist Party failed to elect members to Parliament this time?
    First, due to the aforementioned confusing situation, the British working class still retains a strong illusion of social democracy, believing that the only way to peacefully enter socialism is through parliamentary politics. British workers believe that the Labor Party, which was established by and supported by the trade unions, is their party.
    Second, the anti-democratic British election system serves the two-party system, thus preventing any third party that opposes their policies from being elected to Parliament. That is to say, unlike the situation in France, Italy, and other countries, it is not easy for the British Communist Party to gain parliamentary seats to show its strength among the working masses. If you want to campaign in each of the 625 constituencies across the country, you have to come up with £400,000 (according to British election regulations, each candidate must pay a deposit of £150, plus some campaign expenses - translator's note). In this way, only the big bourgeois parties and the Labor Party, which obtains activity funds from the trade unions, are possible. At the same time, the Labor Party leaders deliberately used tricks to confuse the public, calling on workers not to vote for the Communist Party, on the grounds that this would disperse the forces and allow the Conservatives to win.
    Third, in recent times, the reactionaries have launched fierce attacks on the vanguard of the working class struggle, the Communist Party, and have distorted the Party's aims and policies with all kinds of slanders and lies.
    In the election, the Communist Party had its main purpose, which was to defeat the Conservative Party, mobilize workers to prepare for future class struggles, and put forward a political program against the crisis and war policies of other parties. Although the Communist Party failed to elect independent members to Parliament, the success of the Communist Party's campaign should be measured by this victory in defeating the Conservative Party. It must be known that the factors that are decisive for the increasingly deep crisis and the increasing class struggle are not election votes, and the strength of the Communist Party is manifested in its increasing influence on factories and trade unions. The day after the general election, the Workers' Daily said: "In recent months, the British working class will encounter a new and harsh budget and a further reduction in living standards."
    It can be said that a government with such an unstable nature will naturally not have a long life. During the existence of this government, it will continuously bow to pressure. In a world where the democratic camp, led by the great alliance of the Soviet Union and People's Democratic China, is growing stronger, the embarrassed American imperialism will further increase its already great power to control Britain and tie her tightly to the war bloc.
    The American people regard the problem as serious, and it can be said that none of the problems were solved in this election, but instead made the problem more serious. The "two nations" within Britain (referring to the bourgeoisie and the working class - translator's note), in this election it is not difficult to see, are entering positions in order to carry out future real and decisive battles. The policies of the Conservative Party and the social democratic elements are all proven to be bankrupt. They cannot have any policy other than attacking the working class and the colonial people, but no matter how complex the situation is, the working class will abandon today's illusions and increasingly turn to the Communist Party for leadership. The great British proletariat, which has heroically participated in many class struggles in the past, will have the last word in history.

　　关于英国选举
　　艾洪
    英国这次大选在现代英国政治史上造成了一种新的情势，即几乎造成了议会的僵局。在上一届议会中，工党议员所占席次比以邱吉尔为首的保守党几乎有将近两倍的多数。但今天，这个优势的多数业已消失，工党只比他们的政敌多了一小撮席位而已。工党领袖们认为有三十议席的多数是使议会政治机器活动的最起码的数目，但是这次工党所得的多数远不到三十席。
    曾经一度强大的自由党这次企图大举复兴，但是失败了，他们仅获得九席。前届议会中的五位工党独立分子全部落选。两位共产党议员，皮拉丁和加拉赫，也未当选，以致共产党在议会中没有代表。
    新的议会席次如下（尚有五处选举结果未揭晓）：
              一九五○年      一九四五年
　　工党      三一五          三九三
　　保守党    二九四          二一三
　　自由党    九              十二
　　共产党    一              二
　　其他（尚未发表）    七              二○
    选票情形如下：
              一九五○年        一九四五年
　　工党      一三、二○九、四○○      一一、九六七、九八五
　　保守党    一二、四○八、八○七      九、八四七、二二二
　　自由党    二、六一○、二七二        二、二二七、四○○
　　共产党    九一、七四六    一○二、七八○
    英国三千四百万选民投票者占百分之八十四，这是英国历史上投票记录最高的一次。
    这个选举结果解决不了英国的任何问题。艾德礼现拟组织的新政府不可能是一个稳定的政府，做了一个时期的弥补一时的政府之后，大概将不可避免地举行新的选举，否则右翼工党头子们就将公开地与邱吉尔打交道。因为，在未来的时期中，现在的工党政府将要一方面受到保守党和美帝国主义的重大压力，另一方面由于英国经济危机的日趋深刻，受到工人们要求采取反资本主义措施的与时俱增的要求。
    大选是在资本主义危机扩展的条件之下举行的，正如在整个资本主义世界一样，经济危机决非马歇尔“援助”、贬值、进攻工人生活和殖民地人民等政策所能解决。
    为什么在这次大选中，保守党能获得这许多选票，工党损失很重，而共产党--唯一提出解决英国人民大众的问题的政策的党--在下院中一席也得不到呢？
    保守党，有权势的独占资本家的工具，英国所有主要宣传工具的控制者，对工党政府进了长时间的攻势。他们的目的是为了复辟，像在美帝国主义控制的其他国家所已发生的一样，如法国、意大利、比利时、澳大利亚、新西兰，在这些国家里，公开的右翼政党皆被扶置上台，共产党遭受着沉重的攻击。
    这不是因为大资本家们害怕像艾德礼和贝文这一流人。远非如此，艾德礼和贝文所执行的正是伪装着骗人的“社会主义”花言巧语的纯粹的资本主义政策。不过，工党领袖们的政策业已遇到工会运动者日益增强的反抗，保守党担心在工人阶级斗争趋于高潮时（在经济危机进一步扩大时，工人阶级斗争是会增强的），工党的欺骗技俩不能压服增大的群众不满。
    例如，一月十二日，宣布大选的次日，英国工会各执行委员会的一次全国性会议就代表了群众日益增长的不满，几几乎使政府在物价高涨中建议工资仍予冻结的政策为之失败。工党内阁是希望这全国性会议会一致赞成这个反动政策的，因此大吃一惊。但在去年九月间的工会大会上，虽有共产党的坚决反对，竟有五百五十万的多数表示支持这个所谓“工资冻结”的办法。在一月间，仅仅经过了四个月的时间，在选举的前夕，支持“工资冻结”的人数已降至七十五万。正是由于共产党的影响增大的结果，许多重要工业的工人才决定不支持这个反动政策。
    由于保守党为了复辟而进行了巨大的努力，同时人民在它们执政下所经历的苦难记忆犹新，这样就使某部分人民感到混乱。广大的人民一方面恐惧保守党上台，但另一方面，人们却看到工党对主要问题的政策又和保守党的如出一辙，例如大西洋公约、马歇尔计划、反苏阴谋、殖民地战争、“工资冻结”、美军继续留驻英国、维持资产阶级统治、压迫共产党和庞大的军费支出。
    所有这些政策都直接违反了一九四五年工党在它的竞选纲领中对人民所作的诺言。假使工党领袖们忠实于他们的诺言，与苏联友好合作，争取和平并且向独占资本家大力进攻，那么工人与中层阶级就会继续信赖工党而使保守党的任何再起挣扎成为不可能。正是由于工党头子们对战斗的工人及共产党竭力进攻，并且充当美帝国主义的走狗，这一背叛工人阶级的罪行才造使保守党的势力增大。在这次大选中，保守党未能上台，这并非是由于工党政府有孚众望之处，而是由于产业工人仍然对英帝国主义的阶级政党--保守党有着深刻的传统的憎恨的原故。正是共产党始终如一地领导了反对保守党的斗争，并且在这次竞选中进行了独立的竞选运动，才是反动头子邱吉尔未能复辟成功的主要原因。
    共产党这次未能选入议会的理由在那里呢？
    第一，由于上述的混乱的情况，英国工人阶级仍然保留有强烈的对社会民主主义的幻想，认为欲和平地进入社会主义只有经过议会政治的途径才有可能。英国的工人们认为这个为工会所建立，并为工会所支持的工党是他们的政党。
    第二，英国反民主的选举制度为两党制度服役，因之阻止了任何反对他们的政策的第三党得以选入议会。这就是说，和法国、意大利等国的情形不同，英国共产党不容易获得议员席次以表示出它在工人群众中的力量来。如欲在全国六二五个选区内每区都进行竞选，便不得不拿出四十万镑（按英国选举规定，每一候选人须缴一百五十镑保证金，另外尚须若干竞选费用-译注）。这样，就只有大资产阶级政党和自工会获得活动费的工党才有可能。同时，工党头子们故意耍弄手腕以混乱视听，号召工人们不要投共产党的票，理由是这样便要分散力量而使保守党人获胜。
    第三，最近一个时期来，反动派们就针对工人阶级斗争的先锋队--共产党，施展猛烈的攻击，并以各种各样的诬蔑和谎言来曲解党的目的和政策。
    在选举中，共产党有其主要目的，即击败保守党，动员工人准备着将来的阶级斗争，并提出了反对其他政党的危机与战争政策的政治纲领。虽然共产党未能在议会中选入独立的议员，但共产党竞选的成功却应以击败保守党，这一胜利来衡量。必须知道：对危机日益深刻和阶级斗争日益增长的形势具有决定意义的因素，并不是选举票，共产党的力量表现在对工厂和工会的日渐增加的影响上。大选次一日，工人日报曾说：“最近几个月里，英国工人阶级就会遭遇到一个新而苛酷的预算和生活水平进一步降低的打击。”
    可以说，一个政府既然具备了这样一个不稳定的性质，它的寿命自然也就不会长。在这个政府存在期间，它会连续地向压力低头。在全世界以苏联和人民民主中国伟大同盟为首的民主阵营日趋壮大中，狼狈的美帝国主义必将进一步增强业已很大的力量来控制英国并将她紧紧地束缚在战争集团里。
    美国人民视为重大的问题，这次选举可以说一个也没有解决，反而使问题更加严重了。英国国内的这“两个国家”（按指资产阶级与工人阶级--译注），在这次选举中不难看出，正在进入阵地以便进行未来的真正的而且有决定性的战斗。保守党的政策，社会民主主义分子的政策都一样，皆已证明是破产了的东西。他们除下进攻工人阶级与殖民地人民外不可能有另外的政策，但是不管局势如何复杂，工人阶级将要抛掉今日的幻想，而日益转到共产党方面来要求领导。伟大的英国无产阶级，过去曾经英勇地参加过多次的阶级斗争，将在历史上说最后一句话。
