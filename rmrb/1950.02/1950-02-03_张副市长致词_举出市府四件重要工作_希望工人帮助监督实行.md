Vice Mayor Zhang Youyu, in his speech, outlined four important tasks in the municipal government's work plan for this year that are related to the working class: First, to restore and develop production. This is the overriding central task for Beijing this year. The successful completion of this task mainly relies on the working class, giving full play to their initiative and creativity, improving technology, and striving to increase output, improve quality, and reduce costs. The second and third tasks are the implementation of the resolution on relieving unemployed workers and the resolution on establishing amateur remedial schools, which were passed by the Second Session of the People's Representative Conference of All Circles and are about to begin. The fourth task is to improve workers' medical facilities. The government will help major factories equip clinics, establish clinics in areas with large numbers of working people, and liaise with public and private hospitals to provide preferential treatment for workers seeking medical care. Vice Mayor Zhang said that he hopes everyone will help and supervise the implementation of these four tasks.

Next, representatives spoke. Qian Duansheng, a representative of the Education Workers' Union, said: It was unimaginable during the past reactionary rule that mental and manual laborers would meet together. We must gradually shorten the distance between mental and manual labor. The task of mental laborers is to implement the New Democratic cultural and educational policy, but if cultural and educational work cannot serve production and the working people, the task certainly cannot be completed. Wang Dake, representative of the Beijing Clothing Factory, Guo Xidong, representative of the Mentougou Coal Mine, and Su Yinsheng, a model railway worker representative, all expressed their gratitude to the Communist Party and the People's Liberation Army for enabling the working class to stand up and become masters of their own destiny. In the future, they will overcome difficulties, work hard to produce, support the Liberation War, and make Beijing move towards becoming a production city.

During the conference, units such as the China People's Printing Factory, the Beijing Clothing Factory, and the Trolleybus Company presented flags and flowers to the conference as a tribute. They all expressed their gratitude to the preparatory committee of the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions for their leadership and assistance in the past year. The representative of the Trolleybus Company who presented the flag also stated that they would celebrate the success of the conference and the establishment of the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions with voluntary labor and exceeding the production plan.

Yesterday afternoon, Xiao Ming reported on the work summary of the Beijing Municipal Federation of Trade Unions Preparatory Committee over the past year, explaining the achievements and existing problems in organizational work, propaganda and education work, and assisting in takeover, production, labor protection, and welfare; and reported on the experiences and lessons learned from the democratization of factory management and the signing of collective labor-management contracts.

The agenda for today (3rd) includes Xiao Ming reporting on the future work tasks of the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, and work reports from trade unions in factories such as the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant.

    举出市府四件重要工作  希望工人帮助监督实行
    张友渔副市长致词时，举出市政府今年工作计划中与工人阶级有关系的四件重要工作：第一是恢复与发展生产。这是今年北京市压倒一切的中心工作。要很好地完成这一任务主要的要依靠工人阶级，发挥他们的积极性与创造性，改进技术，为增加产量、提高质量与减低成本而努力。第二件和第三件是即将开始执行第二届各界人民代表会议所通过的救济失业员工决议案和成立业余补习学校决议案。第四件是改善工人医疗设备。政府将帮助各大工厂设备医务所，在劳动人民众多的地方设立诊疗所，与公私立医院接洽，对工人看病，予以优待。张副市长说，这四件工作，希望大家帮助和监督实行。
    接着由代表讲话，教育工作者工会代表钱端升说：脑力劳动者与体力劳动者在一起开会，在过去反动统治时期是不可想像的事。我们一定要逐渐缩短体力劳动与脑力劳动之间的距离。脑力劳动者的任务是实施新民主主义文化教育政策，但是文教工作如果不能为生产和劳动人民服务，一定不能完成任务。北京被服厂代表王大可、门头沟煤矿代表郭锡栋、劳动模范铁路工人代表苏寅生讲话时，都表示感谢共产党和解放军，使工人阶级翻身做主人。今后要克服困难，努力生产，支援解放战争，使北京向生产城市迈进一步。
    大会进行中，有中国人民印刷厂、北京被服厂、电车公司等单位向大会献旗、献花致敬。他们一致对市总工会筹委会过去一年的领导和帮助，表示谢意。电车公司献旗代表并表示要以义务献工、超出生产计划来庆祝大会的成功和市总工会的成立。
    昨天下午，萧明报告北京市总工会筹委会一年来的工作总结，说明在组织工作，宣教工作，协助接管、生产、劳保、福利等方面的工作成绩及存在的问题；并报告了工厂管理民主化和订立劳资集体合同的经验教训。
    大会今（三）日议程，有萧明报告市总工会今后工作任务，石景山钢铁厂等工厂的工会工作报告等项。
