　　Northeast China's State-owned Factories and Mines
    Appropriately Improve Production Organization and Effectively Promote the Record-Breaking Movement
    [This newspaper reported] In order to adapt to the development of new productive forces, state-owned and public factories and mines in Northeast China have appropriately improved labor organization and effectively promoted the new production record movement. Before the record-breaking movement, the Songjiang Shuangyashan Coal Mine had separate groups for drilling, picking, transporting, and supporting. Due to the lack of connection between the groups, idle work was extremely serious and productivity could not be improved. In order to create new production records, the entire mine promoted the advanced experience of the Rui Zhenzong group and universally changed to mixed grouping in October of last year, and implemented a three-shift system with eight-hour work. Under the unified leadership of the group leader, the collective strength and wisdom of the working class was brought into play to complete the common production tasks, and the production volume of the entire mine increased month by month. The average output of the three months of October, November, and December last year increased by 30% compared with the average output of the previous three months, and the cost was reduced by 4.7 billion Northeast currency. The Hegang Coal Mine and Benxi Coal and Iron Company, on the other hand, have further rationally adjusted the labor organization and reduced the waste of labor due to the improvement of production management and the increase of productivity. Since Hegang Coal Mine completed the major reform of production management in November last year, the entire mine has concentrated from 352 large working faces to 140. As a result of the centralized use of machinery and labor, the entire mine extracted more than 800 workers according to the new quota standard to transfer to other production, but the total output still maintained the original level, and the average productivity per person increased from 1.76 tons before the quota to 2.2 tons. Since Benxi Coal and Iron Company improved the tunnel excavation method, the excavation rate has increased unprecedentedly. The mine adapted to this new situation and adjusted the labor organization in a timely manner, extracting more than 100 workers, but the output not only did not decrease, but increased from 2,300 tons per day to 3,000 tons. The third type of improved labor organization, such as Benxi Foundry, Beipiao Mining Bureau Transportation Group, Liaoxi Ceramics Factory, Sujiatun Grinding Wheel Factory and other units, implemented a division of labor and special responsibility system in the new production record movement, and at the same time changed the two-shift system to a three-shift system, so the output was higher than before.
    Clear Division of Labor, Fixed Technology Improvement, Improved Labor Organization, Greatly Increased Efficiency
    According to the above facts, production leaders must pay attention to the development of productive forces and improve and adjust the organization of labor in a timely manner. As in Shuangyashan Coal Mine before mixed grouping, each group only took care of completing its own task. When the pickers could not pick down the coal, the transporters had no work to do; when the transporters were too busy, the coal blocked the working face, and the pickers could not work; sometimes the supporting workers were too busy due to the poor working conditions, and accidents often occurred. Due to the irrational labor organization, not only was the phenomenon of idle work extremely serious, but it also seriously affected the improvement of productivity. Secondly, a clear and fixed division of labor is a necessary prerequisite for improving technology. The large kiln of Liaoxi Provincial Ceramics Factory had more than 40 workers, and no one had a certain responsibility, and no one knew what he should do. The work was temporarily allocated by a foreman, so the labor organization was extremely chaotic, and even the old workers who had been working for more than ten years had not mastered the specialized technology. Since the establishment of the division of labor responsibility system, the person who watches the fire specializes in watching the fire, and the person who loads the kiln specializes in loading the kiln. As a result, the technology of firing the kiln, loading the kiln and unloading the kiln has been improved. The firing time of No. 1 kiln has been reduced from 43 hours to 37 hours, and the amount of coal used has been reduced from more than 30,400 kg to more than 22,400 kg. The loss rate of finished products has also dropped from 9.1% to 4.4%. Third, changing from two shifts to three shifts and changing from twelve hours to eight hours working system is an important condition to ensure the health of workers and improve labor efficiency. In the past, the transportation section of Jixi Hengshan Mine had two shifts, each shift working for twelve hours. Due to excessive fatigue of the workers, accidents occurred frequently. Since the implementation of the three-shift system, although each shift has reduced by six people, the number of accidents has been greatly reduced due to the concentration of workers' energy. The workers of Shenyang Grinding Wheel Factory also unanimously reflected: "This change is too good, not only can it restore fatigue, but also have the opportunity to study." Finally, with the improvement of the labor organization, in order to strengthen the connection between each other, the factories and mines have also established some necessary systems. For example, after the Benxi Foundry implemented the three-shift special responsibility system, the molding specializes in molding, the casting specializes in casting, and the box making specializes in box making. Specialization in business can give full play to the effectiveness of technology. However, due to the lack of understanding of the situation between each other, there are also phenomena of mutual cooperation. For example, if the amount of iron smelting increases, the wooden mold cannot be supplied; if the casting team combines the boxes for the molding team, it is easy to scrap the castings due to the lack of understanding of the situation. In order to solve this uncoordinated phenomenon, the factory grasped the main links and promoted other workshops to sign contact contracts. As a result, the output was increased by 1.4 times compared with before, creating a new collective record for increasing production by improving labor organization. In addition, the factories and mines have universally implemented the handover system, so that the upper and lower shifts are connected, the workers understand the machine and all the situations, and can carry out smooth production as soon as they start work, which has a great relationship with the improvement of technology and the increase of output.

　　东北各公营工厂矿山
    适时地改进生产组织  有效推动创纪录运动
    【本报讯】为适应新的生产力的发展，东北国营、公营工厂、矿山适时改进劳动组织，有效的推进了生产新纪录运动。松江双鸭煤矿在创纪录运动以前，打眼、刨镐、运搬、支柱是分别编组的，由于各组间互不衔接，窝工现象极为严重，生产率不能提高。为创造生产新纪录，全矿推行了芮振宗小组的先进经验，于去年十月份普遍改为混合编组，并实行了八点钟工作的三班制。在小组长统一领导下，为完成共同生产任务，发挥了工人阶级的集体力量和智慧，全矿生产量因而逐月上升。去年十、十一、十二三个月平均产量已较前三月平均产量提高百分之三十，并减低成本四十七亿元东北币。而鹤岗煤矿和本溪煤铁公司则是由于生产管理改进和生产率的提高，进一步合理的调整了劳力组织，减少了劳力的浪费现象。鹤岗煤矿自去年十一月份完成了生产管理的大改革，全矿由三百五十二个大掌子集中为一百四十个，由于集中使用机械和劳力的结果，全矿按照新的定员标准抽出八百多工人转入其他生产，但总产量仍然保持原来水平，每人平均生产率却由定员前的一．七六吨上升为二．二吨。本溪煤铁公司自改进坑道掘进方法后，掘进率空前提高，该矿适应这一新情况及时调整了劳力组织，抽调出百余名工人，但产量不仅没有降低，反而由日产二千三百吨提高为三千吨。第三种改进劳力组织的情况，如本溪铸造厂、北票矿务局运输组、辽西陶瓷厂、苏家屯砂轮厂等单位，在生产新纪录运动中实行了分工专责制，同时并改两大班制为三班制，因此产量均较前提高。
    分工明确固定技术提高改进劳力组织效率大增
    根据以上事实的说明：生产领导者必须注意生产力的发展情况，及时改进和调整劳动力的组织。如双鸭煤矿在混合编组前，各组只顾完成自己的任务，刨镐的刨不下煤时，运搬的就没有工作做；运搬的忙不过来，煤堵住掌子时，刨镐的也就不能做活；有时因掌子条件不好，支柱工人忙不过来，往往就发生事故。由于劳力组织上的不合理，不仅窝工现象极为严重，且严重的影响到生产率的提高。其次，分工明确固定，是提高技术的必要前提条件。辽西省营陶瓷厂大窑场有四十多工人，谁也没有一定的责任，谁也不知道自己该干什么，干活都由一个工长临时支配，因此劳动力组织极为紊乱，而且连十几年的老工人也没有掌握住专门技术。自从建立了分工负责制，看火的专看火，装窑的专装窑，结果在烧窑、装窑和出窑的技术上都得到提高。一号窑的烧窑时间已由四十三小时减到三十七小时，用煤量由三万零四百余斤减为二万二千余斤。成品损失率也由百分之九．一降到百分之四．四。第三、改两大班为三班，变十二小时为八小时工作制，是保障工人健康和提高劳动效率的重要条件。鸡西恒山矿运输科，过去为两大班制，每班工作十二点钟，由于工人过度疲劳，经常发生事故。自从实行三班制后，虽然每班减少六个人，但由于工人们精力集中，事故大为减少。沈阳砂轮厂工人也一致反映说：“这样改变太好了，不仅可以恢复疲劳，还能有机会学习。”最后，随着劳力组织的改进，为加强彼此间的联系，各厂矿也建立了一些必要的制度。如本溪铸造厂实行三班专责制后，做型的专做型，浇铸的专浇铸，打箱的专打箱，业务上专业化，可以充分发挥技术的效能。但由于彼此不了解情况，也发生互相配合不上的现象。比如熔铁量增加了，木型供不上；浇铸班给做型班合箱，因不了解情况容易使铸品作废。为解决这种不协调的现象，该场掌握主要环节推动其他车间订立了联系合同，结果产量较前提高一．四倍，创造了改进劳动组织增加产量的集体新纪录。此外，各厂矿普遍实行了交接班制，使上下班工作衔接，上班者了解机器及一切情况，一上班便能进行顺利的生产，对技术的改进和产量提高都有很大的关系。
