　　Amateur School Directly Under the North China Military Region
    First Semester Graduation Awards
    Summarizing the Achievements and Experiences of the First Semester; Rewarding Model Teachers and Staff, and Outstanding Students
    [Our Newspaper's Dispatch] The General School of the Amateur Supplementary School Directly Under the North China Military Region of the People's Liberation Army held its first semester graduation awards ceremony on the 30th of last month. More than a thousand teachers, staff, and students from the seven branch schools attended. The venue was surrounded by displays of student learning achievements, including various assignments, charts, and photos of teaching activities. At the meeting, Zhang Zhixiang, Deputy Director (and Principal) of the Political Department of the Military Region, succinctly summarized the achievements of the amateur school in the first semester and the experience in running the amateur school. He pointed out that the achievements of the amateur school were: seven branch schools were opened, with a total of 1,112 students (including 731 cadres and 381 soldiers), accounting for more than 80% of the total number of cadres and soldiers in the department who should receive supplementary cultural education. Many students who originally knew few characters can now write reports, write letters, and read newspapers. Many comrades who did not even recognize Arabic numerals have learned addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and decimal operations; the intermediate class has completed fractions. More than 80% of the total number of students passed the semester exam. After democratic evaluation and school review, ten model teachers and staff, thirty-four outstanding students, and ninety first-class students were selected.
    When talking about the basic experience of running the amateur school, Deputy Director Zhang pointed out: "To establish something new, the leadership must first persevere tenaciously. Because establishing something new often encounters obstacles, including ideological obstacles and material difficulties. When the amateur school was first established, some people believed that cadres learning culture would hinder work. We believe that this is a short-sighted view. Facts have proved that in units where learning is done well, everyone works harder, and the working ability of cadres is also improved." He said: "The leadership's emphasis is the key to running an amateur school well. For example, the branch school of the special forces has been run better because they regard running the amateur school as a political task, and leading cadres personally take action to supervise and inspect."
    Secondly, he pointed out: From the students' achievements, it can be seen that students with high political consciousness study well. Cadres from worker and peasant backgrounds deeply feel the pain of lacking culture, and their learning requirements are urgent. Their enthusiasm for learning is based on a high degree of class consciousness, so their progress is significant.
    In addition, Deputy Director Zhang, based on the experience of this semester, explained that it is best for the amateur school to have a full-time director of teaching and full-time teachers. This is to avoid absenteeism, seriously correct student assignments, and regularly study and improve teaching methods.
    Finally, he encouraged everyone to consolidate their existing achievements. Review and make up lessons well during the winter vacation. At the same time, each branch school should also make necessary rectifications to welcome the next period of study.
    Outstanding student Bei Fuxing spoke at the meeting, recounting that he could not afford to study when he was young due to poverty, and did not study well after joining the revolution. He always thought that "being able to fight, produce, and endure hardships is enough." As a result, because of his low level of education, "some of my past experiences cannot be summarized, and many valuable experiences have been lost." His words gave all the students a great feeling of emotion.
    Finally, the meeting rewarded the model teachers and staff, outstanding students, and first-class students. Deputy Director Zhang Zhixiang personally issued the prizes.

　　华北军区直属业余学校
    第一学期学员结业评奖
    总结第一学期成绩和经验奖励模范教职员优等学员
    【本报讯】人民解放军华北军区直属业余补习学校总校于上月卅日召开了第一学期结业评奖大会。到会的有所属七个分校教、职、学员千余人。会场四周陈列着学员的学习成绩，包括各种作业、图表和教学活动的照片等。会上，军区政治部张致祥副主任（兼校长）扼要综述了业余学校第一学期的成绩和办理业余学校的经验。他指出业余学校的成绩是：开办了七个分校，共有学员一千一百十二名（其中干部七百卅一人，战士三百八十一人），占该部应该补习文化的干部、战士总人数的百分之八十以上。很多学员原来识字不多，现在可以写报告、写信、看报纸了。许多原来连阿拉伯字码也不认识的同志，已学会了加减乘除法和小数运算；中级班则学完了分数。学期考试成绩及格的占学员总人数的百分之八十以上。经过民主评定和学校审查，评选出了十名模范教职员和三十四名优等学员，九十名甲等学员。
    在谈到办理业余学校的基本经验时，张副主任指出：“要建立一个新的东西，首先要领导上顽强地坚持。因为建立一个新的东西往往会遇到障碍，其中包括思想障碍和物质困难。业余学校初建时，有人认为干部学习文化会妨碍工作，我们认为这是近视眼的看法。事实证明：凡是学习搞得好的单位，大家工作得就起劲，干部工作能力也有所提高。”他说：“领导上重视，是办好业余学校的关键。如特种兵部队的分校办得较好，即因他们把办业余学校当作政治任务，领导干部亲自动手去督促检查。”
    其次，他指出：从学员成绩中看出：凡是政治觉悟高的学员学习就好。工农出身的干部，深感没有文化的痛苦，学习要求迫切。他们的学习热情是建立在高度的阶级觉悟基础上的，因此进步显著。
    此外，张副主任根据这一学期的经验，说明业余学校最好设置专任的教导主任与专任教员。借以避免缺课，并做到认真修改学员作业，经常研究改进教学方法。
    最后，他勉励大家巩固已有成绩。在寒假中好好温课补课。同时，各分校也要作必要的整顿，迎接下期的学习。
    优等学员贝福兴在会上讲话，诉述他幼年家贫念不起书，参加革命后又没有很好学习，总以为“会打仗、会生产，能吃苦耐劳就行了”，结果因文化程度低，“自己过去的一些经验就总结不起来，好多宝贵的经验都丢了。”他的话给全体学员以很大的感动。
    最后，会上奖励了各模范教职员、优等学员和甲等学员。由张致祥副主任亲自发给奖品。
