Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, January 30th. The People's Liberation Army East China Military Region and the Third Field Army troops stationed in Nanjing are enthusiastically responding to the Nanjing Second People's Representative Conference's resolution on "mutual assistance and relief for refugees" and the donation campaign launched by the Refugee Relief Committee, actively saving food and clothing to relieve the disaster victims scattered in Nanjing and its suburbs. In 1949, the people in counties near Nanjing, as well as Shandong, Anhui, and Henan, suffered severe floods. The number of people from these disaster-stricken areas who flocked to Nanjing once reached more than 60,000. After those who have been given funds to return to their hometowns to make a living are removed from the total, there are still more than 30,000 refugees scattered in Nanjing. According to preliminary statistics, in the past twenty-odd days, the donations from various troops, organizations, and schools of the People's Liberation Army stationed in Nanjing have totaled more than 30.02 million yuan in RMB, 52,555 jin of grain, more than 127,100 pieces of clothing, 10,384 pairs of shoes and socks, 939 real-value units, and many other items. Under the leadership of the CCP Party Committee, the various units of the directly subordinate teams have universally launched the "one liang of rice," "one thousand yuan," and "one item" campaign. Many commanders and fighters do not smoke or buy daily necessities, donating all of their meager allowances and healthcare funds to relieve the disaster victims. Many units' management and administrative offices held forums to discuss how to save food and donate to the refugees. After the leaders of the Nanjing Garrison troops conveyed the situation of the disaster victims and explained the origin and suffering of these victims, the various units began to discuss "where did the people's disaster come from?" In the discussions at the squad level, the soldiers further discussed how the people's army should do its best to help solve the people's difficulties. Many cadres and soldiers also related the disasters and sufferings they had suffered under the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang in the past, deepening everyone's understanding and sympathy for the disaster victims. All commanders and fighters automatically and consciously competed to donate. Many students from the East China Military and Political University and the Naval Academy donated money, gold rings, and clothing brought from home, and also collectively wrote letters to express their sympathy to the people in the disaster areas. Under the leading influence of the supply system personnel, the salary system personnel of the logistics department's factories, hospitals, and medical schools also enthusiastically launched the "one sheng of rice" campaign.

　　驻宁部队响应人民代表会号召
    节衣缩食救济灾民
    普遍展开“一两米”、“一千元”、“一件物”运动
    【新华社南京三十日电】人民解放军华东军区暨第三野战军驻宁各部，热烈响应南京市第二届人民代表会议“互助互济、救济难民”决议及难民处理委员会发起的募捐运动，纷纷节衣缩食，救济流散于南京市内及市郊的灾民。一九四九年南京附近各县和山东、安徽、河南等地人民均遭严重水灾，这些地区受灾的人民流至南京的，曾经达到六万人之多，除已资遣返乡谋生者以外，现在还有三万余难胞散住南京。据初步统计，廿余天来驻在南京的解放军的各部队、机关、学校的捐款共达人民币三千零二十余万元，粮食五万二千五百五十五斤，衣服十二万七千一百余件，鞋袜一万零三百八十四双，折实单位九百三十九个，及其他物品甚多。直属队各单位在中共党委领导下，普遍展开“一两米”、“一千元”、“一件物”运动。很多指战员不抽烟，不买日用品，把仅有的津贴费和保健费全部捐出来救济灾民。很多单位的管理处与事务处人员举行了座谈，讨论怎样节省粮食，捐助难民。南京警备部队各部首长传达了灾民的情况和说明了这些灾民的由来与痛苦后，各部就展开讨论“人民的灾难是那里来的”。战士们在以班为单位的讨论中，进一步讨论到人民军队应该如何尽力帮助解决人民的困难。很多干部战士还联系过去在国民党反动统治下自身所受的灾难与痛苦，加深了大家对灾民的了解和同情。全体指战员们都自动自觉地竞相捐助。华东军政大学和海军学校的很多同学把家里带来的钱、金戒指和衣服等捐出来，并且还集体写信慰问灾区人民。在供给制人员的带头影响下，后勤部各工厂、医院、医务学校的薪给制人员亦热烈开展“一升米”运动。
