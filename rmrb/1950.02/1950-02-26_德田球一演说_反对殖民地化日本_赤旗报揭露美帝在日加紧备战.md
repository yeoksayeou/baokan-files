    Opposes the Colonization of Japan
    *Red Flag* Exposes US Imperialism's Intensified War Preparations in Japan
    Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, February 25th: According to a United Press report from Tokyo on February 23rd: Tokuda Kyuichi, Secretary-General of the Japanese Communist Party, delivered a speech at a youth rally of 5,000 people "Opposing the Colonization of Japan," denouncing the imperialist Yoshida Cabinet and the imperialists behind it for doing their utmost to make Japan the front line of a third world war. Tokuda called on the youth masses to rise up, overthrow the Yoshida government, and eradicate the monopoly capital behind it. Tokuda assured the masses that the Japanese Communist Party would fight alongside them for freedom. Tokuda pointed out that the recently concluded Sino-Soviet treaty would naturally strike a blow at those Japanese with imperialist ideas and those behind them with aggressive ideas.
    Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, February 25th: According to a United Press report from Tokyo: The Japanese Communist Party's newspaper, *Red Flag*, revealed on February 21st the activities of the United States in establishing military bases in Japan and ordering large quantities of military equipment. *Red Flag* pointed out that the industrial zone of northern Kyushu is currently being transformed into an arsenal. The newspaper's reporter stationed in Yawata, Kyushu, reported that the northern Kyushu industrial zone is now engaged in manufacturing war supplies. For example, Nippon Steel Corporation's Yawata plant has already received an order for 100,000 tons of steel to be shipped to Okinawa. Several factories are producing chemicals for manufacturing ammunition under the guise of "preparing to produce nylon fibers." Other factories are producing soda and other products that can be readily used to manufacture gunpowder and poison gas. In addition, several factories are producing special cement for shipment to Okinawa, Burma, and the Philippines. The reporter also revealed that Karita Port in northern Kyushu, which was used by the Japanese Navy as a new base during the last war, is currently undergoing the construction of a large-scale waterway system.
