　　Beijing Liberation Anniversary
    Tram Company Holds Celebration
    [Beijing News] The Beijing Tram Company Repair Factory held a celebration meeting on the afternoon of the 3rd of this month to commemorate the anniversary of the liberation of Beijing. All employees attended. First, Hu Jingui, director of the factory's trade union, reported on the significance of the meeting, calling on everyone to work hard to complete the 1950 production plan. Then, various workers spoke one after another, using their personal experiences to explain the differences between after liberation and before liberation, recalling the cruel and vicious exploitation under the rule of the Kuomintang reactionaries. They were all excited and happy to have become the masters of the factory in the past year. Qi Shiling said that his home was outside the city, and the Kuomintang reactionaries demolished his house to build fortifications. Yang Daoqi said: Before liberation, if you were injured on the job, it was your bad luck, and no one would care! Now it's different. Bai Yuchao said: How could the salary issued by the Kuomintang keep up with the pace of prices? You always had to tighten your belt all year round; now the government issues in-kind wages, guaranteeing our lives. The workers all firmly stated that they must work harder to guarantee the completion of the 1950 production tasks.

　　北京解放一周年
    电车公司集会庆祝
    【北京讯】北京电车公司修造厂在本月三日下午举行庆祝北京解放周年纪念会，全体职工均出席。首由该厂工会主任胡金桂报告开会的意义，号召大家努力完成一九五○年生产计划。接着各工友纷纷发言，用他们亲身的经历说明解放后与解放前不同的地方，回忆起国民党反动派统治剥削的残酷毒辣；而一年来自己却成了工厂主人，无不兴奋愉快。齐士苓说，他家住在城外，国民党反动派把他的房子拆毁修了工事。杨道启说：解放前因公受伤，那是活该倒霉，才没人管呢！现在可不同了。白玉超说：在国民党时发的那点儿薪资，怎能比得上物价跑的快？一年到头总得紧着裤带；现在政府发的是实物工资，保障了我们的生活。工友们都坚决表示：一定要加紧干活保证完成一九五○年的生产任务。
