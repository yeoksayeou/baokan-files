　　The Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance, and Mutual Assistance and the Chinese Economy
    Wang Xuewen
    The Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance, and Mutual Assistance was signed on February 14th, along with agreements on the Changchun Railway, Lushun Dalian, and loans. This is a momentous and historically significant event. From now on, the two great nations of China and the Soviet Union, representing approximately one-third of the world's population, have established a close relationship of friendship, alliance, and mutual assistance.
    The signing of this treaty and these agreements is a major piece of good news for the Chinese economy, which has suffered greatly from the ravages of American imperialism and the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, and for the Chinese people who are fighting against natural disasters and working to recover from the wounds of war! We can predict how it will positively influence the Chinese economy:
    First, China's New Democratic economy was established through the people's democratic revolution, that is, through the people's struggle against imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism. Now that the national revolution has been victorious, American imperialism and the remnants of the Chiang bandits are not resigned to their defeat. They are constantly plotting to undermine the People's Republic of China, and they pay even more attention to the people's economy. Wall Street is clamoring for war, and its lackeys, as well as the Chiang Kai-shek defeated clique, are also waving flags and cheering in support. The conclusion of the Sino-Soviet treaty, the great unity of the people of the two great nations, has consolidated and strengthened the power of the world's peace and democracy camp, and severely struck a blow to the instigators of war. The recovery and construction of the Chinese economy will now have a strong political guarantee.
    Second, the Chinese economy has suffered severe damage after years of war. Recovering the Chinese economy requires great strength, and after a few years of effort, restoring the Chinese economy will require even greater effort. However, the recovery and improvement of economic strength require certain material conditions. China's economy is backward and has suffered extreme damage, lacking these material conditions. The Soviet Union is an advanced socialist country, and after more than 30 years of economic construction, its social productive forces have been greatly improved and possess these material conditions. The Soviet Union lends us various urgently needed factory and mine machinery and equipment, transportation equipment, and other economic construction materials, which will greatly help our future economic recovery and increase the proportion of our industry.
    Third, after China and the Soviet Union conclude the Treaty of Friendship, Alliance, and Mutual Assistance and various agreements, the transportation and trade relations between the two countries will become more frequent and closer. This not only effectively opposes the blockade by American imperialism and the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, but more importantly, it is of great help to the recovery of China's New Democratic economy. That is to say, due to the establishment of transportation and trade relations with the Soviet Union, our foreign trade can be developed, which can promote the recovery of agricultural, industrial, and mining production (such as tea, tung oil, mineral sand, etc.). Due to the development of production, transportation, and trade, the various departments and components of the people's economy will also promote each other and gradually become active. The unemployed left over from old China will also be likely to decrease. Moreover, due to the development of transportation and trade with the Soviet Union, trade relations with the people's democratic countries of Eastern Europe can also be expanded, which will be more conducive to our economic recovery.
    Fourth, we not only receive material and financial assistance from the Soviet Union, but also the knowledge and experience needed to restore and develop our economy can be obtained. Due to the backwardness of the Chinese economy, the corrupt rule and destruction of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, it is impossible to train and accommodate a large number of specialized technical personnel. We feel the lack of technical personnel when carrying out huge economic construction. The Soviet Union provides us with this kind of talent, they have rich knowledge and experience in economic construction, they know how to plan economic construction, how to move from an agricultural country to an industrial country, how to overcome difficulties, they have specialized knowledge and skills, which combined with the enthusiasm of Chinese workers and the wisdom of Chinese workers, can generate great power, the record of Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant is an example. The knowledge and experience of these experts are extremely valuable. If we study these knowledge and experience carefully and combine them with the reality of China's construction, we will definitely be greatly beneficial to the development of financial and economic work.
    In short, the establishment of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance, and Mutual Assistance not only has its great world significance, and great significance for China's politics and security, but also has great significance for China's economy. Under the leadership of the People's Government, the efforts of the people, and the friendly assistance of the Soviet Union, the Chinese economy will gradually overcome the current difficulties, restore production, and steadily move towards prosperity and happiness!

　　中苏友好同盟互助条约与中国经济
    王学文
    中苏友好同盟互助条约在二月十四日签字了，同时签订了关于长春铁路，旅顺大连及贷款协定。这是富有历史意义的巨大事件。从此，中苏两大国约占全世界三分之一的人民，确立了友好同盟互助的亲密关系。
    这个条约与协定的签订，对于饱受美帝国主义，蒋介石匪帮摧残的中国经济，对于正在向灾荒斗争和为恢复战争创伤的中国人民，是一个重大的喜讯！我们可以预测它怎样良好地影响中国经济：
    第一、中国新民主主义经济是经过人民民主革命，即经过人民反帝反封建反官僚资本主义的斗争建立起来的。现在全国革命胜利以后，美帝国主义和蒋匪残余并不因他们的失败而善罢甘休。他们时时刻刻在阴谋破坏中华人民共和国，而人民经济更为他们所注重。华尔街叫喊着战争，它的仆从们以及蒋介石败残集团也在摇旗呐喊助威。中苏条约的缔结，两大国人民的伟大团结，巩固和加强了世界和平民主阵营的力量，严重的打击了战争挑拨者。中国经济的恢复与建设，今后就得到政治上的有力保障。
    第二、中国经济经过多年的战争，遭受到严重的破坏。恢复中国经济需要很大的力量，经过几年的努力，恢复中国经济则需要更巨大的努力。而经济力量的恢复与提高，非有一定物质的条件不可。中国经济落后，又受到极大的破坏，正缺乏这种物质的条件。苏联是先进的社会主义国家，经过三十多年的经济建设，社会的生产力已大大地提高，洽具有这种物质的条件。苏联贷给我们迫切需要的各种工厂、矿山机器设备与交通器材等等经济建设的物资，对于我们今后的经济恢复，对于增加我们工业的比重，是有很大的帮助的。
    第三、中苏缔结友好同盟互助条约与各个协定后，两国间的交通关系与贸易关系，将更加频繁密切。这不仅有力的反对了美帝国主义蒋匪帮的封锁，同时，更重要的是对于中国新民主主义经济的恢复有重大的帮助。这就是说，由于对苏交通与贸易关系的建立，我们的对外贸易可以发展起来，可以促进农、工、矿业生产的恢复（譬如茶叶、桐油、矿砂等等）。由于生产、交通与贸易的开展，人民经济的各个部门各个成份，也就互相推动互相促进，逐渐地活跃起来。旧中国遗留下来的失业人员，也将有可能减少。并且，由于对苏交通贸易的发展，同时也就可以展开对东欧各人民民主国家的贸易关系，这将更有利于我们的经济恢复。
    第四、我们不单在物质上资金上得到苏联的帮助，并且为恢复与发展我们经济所需要的知识与经验，也可以得到帮助。由于中国经济的落后，蒋介石匪帮的腐朽统治与摧残，不可能培养以及容纳多数专门技术人员。我们进行巨大的经济建设，就痛感到技术人员的缺乏。苏联就供给我们这种人才，他们有丰富的经济建设的知识与经验，他们知道如何计划经济建设，如何由农业国走向工业国，如何克服困难，他们有专门的知识与技能，一和中国工人的积极性和中国工人的智慧结合起来，就能产生伟大的力量，石景山炼铁的纪录就是一个例子。这些专门家的知识经验是极宝贵的，我们好好学习这些知识与经验，结合中国建设的实际，一定能够大大有益于财经工作的开展。
    总之，中苏友好同盟互助条约的成立，不只是有它的伟大的世界意义，对中国的政治与安全有重大的意义，同时对于中国的经济，也具有重大的意义。中国经济由于人民政府的领导，人民的努力，再加上苏联的友好帮助，必将逐步克服目前的困难，恢复生产，稳步走向繁荣与幸福！（一九五○、二、一六）
