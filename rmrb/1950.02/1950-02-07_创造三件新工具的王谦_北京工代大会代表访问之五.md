　　In the workshop of the Second Section of Factory 70, the motors roared, driving the screening machine for detonators, shaking back and forth incessantly. The workers happily gathered around to watch this newly assembled tool. They no longer had to lift heavy sieves back and forth in the cold winter, nor worry about their oil-covered hands cracking from the frost. This is because worker Wang Qian had once again created a new tool with astonishing ingenuity. The completion of the new tool not only improved the technology of screening detonators but also saved 25 kilograms of machine oil each month.

　　In the Factory 70 club, Wang Qian drew machine diagrams with a pen, recounting the creative process and the effectiveness of the new tools to the reporter. He said, "In the old society, there was not only no opportunity for creation and research, but even if workers invented new tools, they would not be adopted, and no one would help you research. Only after liberation, when workers labor for themselves and the country they lead, can there be inventions and creations."

　　Wang Qian is a young worker of twenty-seven, but he already has ten years of work experience. After graduating from elementary school, he could not afford to continue his studies, so he went to work as an apprentice in an iron factory. He worked very conscientiously, but in the old society, he was constantly subjected to abuse and scolding. Wang Qian, stubborn by nature, changed several iron factories in a few years. In September 1946, he entered Factory 70 to work. During the Kuomintang rule, the burden of life weighed him down, and wages could never keep up with soaring prices. Those bureaucrats only knew how to get rich personally; who cared about the life and death of the workers?! When the Communist Party came, Wang Qian found his home. The leadership cared about the workers, and the workers actively produced. The administration of Factory 70 called on workers to promote wisdom, creation, and invention. Since then, Wang Qian has been mindful, always looking for opportunities for creation. Last August, the factory manufactured detonators for blasting mountains. However, the previous tools were not suitable. Wang Qian seized this opportunity, carefully researched, and transformed the tool for making primer caps into a tool for making reinforcing covers, and also improved the "deactivation" tool on the reinforcing cover machine. As a result, the output suddenly increased from 6,000 reinforcing covers per day to 12,000, and now it has further increased to 16,000. Due to his creative efforts, he received spiritual and material rewards from the administration and the trade union. Wang Qian was not proud because of this. He humbly told the reporter, "My invention of new tools is inseparable from the encouragement of the administration, the help of technicians, and fellow workers."

　　Immediately afterward, he used his spare time from making reinforcing covers to research and create a tool for making "detonator bottom pits." Previously, the detonators manufactured by the factory had flat bottoms, which required five procedures to complete. However, according to users, if there was a pit at the bottom of the detonator, the explosive power could be doubled. The factory added a tool for manually punching detonator bottom pits. However, due to the backwardness of the tool, it required three workers all day long. Manufacturing one detonator required six procedures. In October, Wang Qian created a tool for punching detonator bottom pits, so that a pit could be directly punched out during the manufacturing of the detonator. This time he was promoted to production team leader.

　　The research on the detonator screening machine began in early November last year. Because there were many production tasks at the time, the research was once interrupted; it was continued at the end of December, and was successfully completed on January 30th this year, using an electric screen to replace the backward hand-cranked screen.

　　Comrade Wang Qian continuously invented three new tools in less than half a year, fully demonstrating the working class's active creative spirit. This time, he was honorably invited to participate in the first Beijing Municipal Workers' Congress as a specially invited representative. He was very happy to hear this news and said, "I can learn a lot of valuable knowledge and experience at the meeting, which will definitely be of greater help to future production."

　　创造三件新工具的王谦
    北京工代大会代表访问之五
    冯仲
    七十兵工厂二所的工作间里，马达隆隆地响，带动筛雷管的机器不停地左右摆动着，工人们高兴地围看这件新装成的工具。他们再也不必在寒冷的冬天抬着笨重的筛子来回的摇，也不必再担心沾满了油的双手被冻裂。因为工人王谦以惊人的智慧又创造了新工具。新工具的完成，不仅将筛雷管的技术提高了一步，且每月能节省机器油二十五公斤。
    在七十兵工厂的俱乐部里，王谦用笔画着机器图样，对记者讲述创造的经过和新工具的效能。他说：“在旧社会，不但没有创造研究的机会，即便工人发明了新工具也不会被采用，更不会有人帮助你研究，只有翻身解放了以后，工人为自己和自己所领导的国家而劳动的时候，才会有发明和创造。”
    王谦是二十七岁的年青工人，但已有了十年工龄。他高小毕业后，因无力继续上学，就到铁工厂去当学徒，工作很尽心，但在旧社会中是不断受气挨骂的。天性倔强的王谦，几年的工夫一连换了几个铁工厂，一九四六年九月才考入了七十兵工厂做工。国民党统治时期，生活的担子压得他喘不过气来，工资永远赶不上飞涨的物价。那些官僚们，只知个人发财，谁又管过工人的死活？！共产党来了，王谦找到了自己的家。领导上关心工人，工人积极生产。七十兵工厂的行政上号召工人发扬智慧，创造发明。此后，王谦就留下心，随时找创造的机会。去年八月，工厂制造开山爆炸用的雷管。但是用以前的工具不合适。王谦抓到这个机会，精心钻研，将制造引火帽的工具改成了能造加强罩的工具，并且又改进了造加强罩机器上的“退活”工具。这样便由过去每天出六千个加强罩，突然增加到一万二千个，现在更提高到一万六千个。由于他的努力创造，得到了行政、工会方面的精神及物质奖励。王谦并没因此而骄傲。他谦虚地对记者说：“我发明新工具是和行政上的鼓励、技术员和工友们的帮助分不开的”。
    紧接着他又利用制造加强罩的空闲时间，研究并创造了制造“雷管顶坑”的工具。先前该厂制造的雷管是平底的，需要五道手续才能做好。但据购用者谈，雷管底下若有个坑，可以增加一倍的爆炸力。厂子里添了用手工打雷管底坑的工具。但因工具的落后，要有三个工人整天打。造一个雷管要经过六道手续。十月间王谦创造了打雷管顶坑的工具，在造雷管时直接就可以撞出坑来。这次他被提拔为生产小组长。
    开始研究筛雷管的机器是去年十一月初的时候。因为当时生产任务很多，研究曾一度中断了；十二月底继续研究，到今年一月三十日获得成功，用电动的筛子代替了落后手摇筛子。
    王谦同志在不到半年期间，连续发明了三件新工具，充分发挥了工人阶级的积极创造精神。这次他光荣地被邀请参加京市首届工人代表大会为特邀代表。他听到这个消息非常高兴地说：“在会上可以学习到很多宝贵的知识和经验，对以后的生产一定有更大帮助”。
