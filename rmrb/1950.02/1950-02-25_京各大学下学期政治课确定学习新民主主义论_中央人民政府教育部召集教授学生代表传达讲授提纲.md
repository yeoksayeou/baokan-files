Beijing Universities to Study "On New Democracy" in the Next Semester's Political Class
Ministry of Education of the Central People's Government Convenes Professors and Student Representatives to Convey and Explain the Teaching Outline

[Reported by this newspaper] Yesterday (the 24th), the Ministry of Education of the Central People's Government convened over 700 professors, lecturers, teaching assistants, and student representatives from universities and colleges in Beijing who are responsible for teaching political classes, to convey the teaching outline for "On New Democracy" in the next semester's political classes. During the winter vacation, the Ministry of Education convened representatives of political class teachers from various schools to prepare a complete teaching outline for "On New Democracy." After a week of discussion, consultation, and repeated revisions, the first draft was completed. When conveying the outline, Vice Minister Qian Junrui first pointed out that during the last semester, the schools conducted the study of "Dialectical Materialism and Historical Materialism," and initially learned the position, viewpoints, and methods of the proletariat. This semester, based on this foundation, they will study the general line and general policy of the Chinese revolution. He then explained the content of the six parts: the historical characteristics of the Chinese revolution, the history of the New Democratic Revolution, New Democratic politics, economics, culture, and the future of the Chinese revolution. He also explained and criticized several major erroneous thoughts that students might have when teaching each part. Finally, Professor He Ganzhi made supplementary remarks.
