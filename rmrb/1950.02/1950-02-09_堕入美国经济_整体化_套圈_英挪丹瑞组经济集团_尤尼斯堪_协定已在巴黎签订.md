　　Falling into the American Economic "Integration" Trap
    Britain, Norway, Denmark, and Sweden Form Economic Group
    "Uniscan" Agreement Signed in Paris
    [Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, February 8th] The so-called "Uniscan" agreement between Britain, Norway, Denmark, and Sweden was signed at the end of last month. Like the "Finebel" group established in December last year, "Uniscan" is part of the overall American plan to open the doors of Western European countries for trade "liberalization" and economic "integration". (Note: Uniscan is a transliteration, formed from the first syllables of United Kingdom, i.e., Britain, and Scandinavia, representing the four-nation economic alliance.)
    According to Agence France-Presse, the agreement was signed at the British Embassy in Paris on the 30th of last month, at which time a "Liquidation Charter" was issued and a "Supervisory Committee" was established. The statement announcing the establishment of the alliance described its purpose as strengthening "economic cooperation" among the four countries. However, the communique issued by the four-nation expert meeting on December 17th last year stated more clearly that the ultimate goal of the alliance is the "multilateral trade relations and free currency convertibility" demanded by the United States, which is to eliminate restrictions on import licenses, currencies, and tariffs in order to implement Hoffman's orders for trade "liberalization" and economic "integration."
    The Danish newspaper "Land og Folk" believes that the significance of this alliance lies in opening up the barriers of Scandinavia so that Britain, the servant of the United States in Europe, can invade their economic sphere. The United States is clearly prepared to sacrifice the interests of the Scandinavian countries, giving some small favors to Britain, which has been squeezed out on the continent, and the ultimate result will be "further elimination of the economic and political independence of the Marshallized countries."

　　堕入美国经济“整体化”套圈
    英挪丹瑞组经济集团
    “尤尼斯堪”协定已在巴黎签订
    【新华社北京八日电】英、挪（威）、丹（麦）、瑞（典）四国的所谓“尤尼斯堪”协定，已于上月底签订。与去年十二月间成立的“法利大卢”集团一样，“尤尼斯堪”是美国打开西欧国家门户的贸易“自由化”和经济“整体化”总计划的一部分。（按尤尼斯堪系uniscan的译音，由联合王国，即英国与斯堪的纳维亚两个字头组成，代表四国经济联盟。）
    据法新社消息，协定于上月三十日在巴黎英国大使馆签字，当时曾发表了一个“清算章程”，并成立了一个“监督委员会”。宣布协定成立的声明，描写联盟的目的在于加强四国“经济合作”。但去年十二月十七日四国专家会议发表的公报说得更明白，联盟的最终目的，就是美国所要求的“贸易上的多边关系和货币的自由兑换”，就是要取消入口执照、货币和关税上的限制，以执行霍夫曼所提出的贸易“自由化”和经济“整体化”的命令。
    丹麦“国土与人民”报认为这个联盟的意义，在于打开斯堪的纳维亚的壁垒，以便美国在欧洲的仆从英国侵入它们的经济领域。美国显然准备牺牲斯堪的纳维亚国家的利益，给予在大陆上被排挤的英国以一些小惠，而其最终结果，则为“进一步取消马歇尔化国家的经济与政治独立”。
