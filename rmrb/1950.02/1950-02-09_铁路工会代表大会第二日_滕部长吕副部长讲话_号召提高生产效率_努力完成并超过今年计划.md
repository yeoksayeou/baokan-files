    Minister Teng and Deputy Minister Lü Speak
    Calling for Increased Production Efficiency
    Strive to Complete and Exceed This Year's Plan
    [Beijing News] The second day of the National Congress of the Chinese Railway Trade Union—the 8th, Minister of Railways Teng Daiyuan and Deputy Minister Lü Zhengcao attended and spoke.
    In his speech, Minister Teng Daiyuan hoped that all the representatives of the congress would organize the national railway employees well in the future, find ways to overcome all difficulties, improve production conditions in accordance with collective contracts, and launch a struggle against bureaucracy and lax discipline. For outstanding employees who improve efficiency, save costs, and abide by labor discipline in their work, various rewards such as commendations, merits, promotions, medals, certificates, and material objects should be given in a timely manner according to the reward system. In order to improve the lives of employees, efforts should be made to run supply stores and gradually organize some welfare undertakings that the state does not need to spend much money on, and everyone can contribute a little effort to. The wage system must be gradually unified nationwide, and other methods and systems must also be unified as soon as possible. Enhance workers' class consciousness and cultural and technical level, unite the people of the whole country, help the country overcome difficulties, promote the restoration and development of the national economy, and strive to complete and strive to exceed the Ministry of Railways' 1950 transportation and construction plan.
    In his speech, Deputy Minister Lü called on everyone to earnestly implement technical standards and the reward system to improve production efficiency. It is necessary to thoroughly save time, save materials, and eliminate accidents. At present, the phenomenon of waste of materials still exists on the railways, and major accidents continue to occur, which is an irresponsible performance towards the lives and property of the people. The bureaucratic style that has caused such serious losses must be eliminated immediately. In order to complete and strive to exceed the tasks of 1950, everyone must organize and work together.
