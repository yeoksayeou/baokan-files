Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, January 31st: A dispatch from the Polish Press Agency in Warsaw on the 28th reports: Since the advanced coal miner, Makiyevka, called for a long-term labor competition to increase coal production in the Six-Year Plan, it has been enthusiastically supported by miners throughout Poland. Miners from coal mining industry trade unions in various regions have announced the amount of coal they will increase production by. For example, at the Stalin Coal Mine, miner Polada and his group have pledged to produce 45,000 tons of coal, instead of the originally planned 29,100 tons.

The Minister of Mining and Energy, Niespolek, sent a letter to Makiyevka, praising him for encouraging the broad masses of miners to participate in long-term labor competitions, which will help the realization of the Six-Year Plan.

The *People's Tribune* published a commentary stating: Long-term competition is a new initiative in labor competition, which will deepen and improve the current mode of labor competition. The *Armed Poland* commented: The miners' pledges demonstrate their increased awareness and also show that the Polish working masses are increasingly aware of their responsible role in the development of the national economy.

    【新华社北京三十一日电】综合波兰通讯社华沙二十八日讯：自从先进的煤矿工人马基夫卡号召以长期的劳动竞赛来提高六年计划的产煤量之后，已得到全波兰矿工的热烈响应。各地采煤工业工会的矿工，纷纷发表他们将要增产的煤的数量。例如，在斯大林煤矿场，矿工波拉达和他的一组就保证要生产四万五千吨煤，以代替原计划的二万九千一百吨。
    采矿与动力部长尼斯波烈克特致函马基夫卡，赞扬他带动广大的矿工群众参加长期劳动竞赛，这将有助于六年计划的实现。
    《人民论坛》报发表评论称：长期竞赛是劳动竞赛中新的倡议，它将加深和改善今天劳动竞赛的方式。《武装的波兰》报评称：矿工的保证，证明他们觉悟的提高，也说明波兰劳动群众越来越认识到他们在发展国民经济中的负责地位。
