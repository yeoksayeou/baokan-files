　　The Whole Nation Joins Forces to Liberate Taiwan
    Commemorating the Third Anniversary of the "February 28th" Incident
    China Zhi Gong Party
    It is of great significance that we are holding a commemoration of the third anniversary of Taiwan’s “February 28th” Incident in Beijing. Because Taiwan is a part of the whole of China, and the Taiwan compatriots are a part of the whole Chinese people, the Taiwan issue is also the issue of China, closely related and inseparable. The entire nation must care for the Taiwan compatriots as one, and work together to resolve the Taiwan issue, liberating Taiwan from the rule of imperialism and the remaining bandit gangs.

    The domestic situation, except for Tibet, has now been entirely liberated. Taiwan, isolated overseas, is still occupied by the Chiang bandit gang as their last lair. To liberate Taiwan, we know that cross-sea operations are not without difficulties, but these difficulties can be overcome. We have already annihilated the elite main force of the Chiang bandit gang. Now, the bandit troops remaining in Taiwan are mostly remnants and defeated soldiers who fled from the Northeast or Southwest, with extremely low morale. In addition, our cause of liberating Taiwan has the active support of the people of the whole country and the people of Taiwan, while the remnant bandits are not only isolated among the people of Taiwan, but also have deep internal contradictions. We will seize the opportunity to "destroy them as easily as eating breakfast." However, tactically speaking, we should not underestimate the enemy and still need to be prudent in order to avoid unnecessary sacrifices. Sun Tzu said it well: "Deliberate before moving, plan to win before engaging." Regarding the technical issues of liberating Taiwan, our People's Liberation Army is rich in combat experience and has experience in crossing the river. They will definitely have a well-thought-out plan and command calmly, making it easy to eliminate the remnant bandits on Taiwan Island, without us armchair strategists talking about it. As for the internal situation in Taiwan, for three hundred years, the Taiwan compatriots have been fighting against imperialist aggression and oppression and against autocratic dictatorship, advancing wave upon wave, continuously. Up until the "February 28th" massacre three years ago, they have demonstrated a consistent revolutionary spirit. This spirit has already formed the cornerstone for overcoming the enemy and winning. However, the dozens of revolutionary struggles in the past did not receive assistance from the broad masses of the people of the whole country, and they had to rely on fighting alone, and inevitably ended in failure. But now the situation is greatly different. The traditional spirit of the people's revolutionary struggle within Taiwan, under the leadership of the Taiwan Democratic Self-Government League, is showing an extremely high tide and extremely expansion. It has already formed an unprecedentedly broad revolutionary united front, strengthening internal resistance forces. At the same time, the People's Liberation Army has liberated the whole country and is approaching Taiwan with overwhelming force. Any remnant bandits on Taiwan Island or any aggressive forces colluding with the remnant bandits are not enough to withstand this invincible and all-conquering army. They will all be crushed before this great army. Therefore, when the time comes, for cross-sea operations, as long as they break through the so-called maritime blockade, many places along the coast of Taiwan can be landed, and with the strength of the people's revolutionary organizations inside Taiwan, attacking from the outside and responding from the inside, the liberation of Taiwan will be imminent. All the chief culprits and major villains of the Chiang bandit gang will either flee to the Philippines and other places beforehand on the planes of their master, the American imperialists, or will be brought to justice before the people. Today, all the democratic parties across the country are participating in the commemoration of "February 28th", which means that the people of the whole country are working together to resolve the Taiwan issue, and especially means that the people of the whole country are unanimously assisting in the liberation of Taiwan, promoting its early realization. What a significant thing this is!

### 全国人民协力解放台湾  “二·二八”三周年纪念  中国致公党

专栏：纪念台湾“二·二八”三周年

　　全国人民协力解放台湾
    “二·二八”三周年纪念
    中国致公党
    我们在北京举行台湾“二·二八”三周年纪念，这是很有重大意义的事。因为台湾是整个中国的一部分，台湾同胞是整个中国人民的一部分，所以台湾问题，也即是中国的问题，是密切相关的，是分不开的，必须全国人民对台湾同胞一体关心，对台湾问题一致协力解决，把台湾从帝国主义和残余匪帮的统治下解放出来。
    现在国内情况，除西藏外，业经全部解放了。台湾因孤悬海上，尚为蒋匪帮所窃据作为最后之巢穴。台湾要解放，我们知道渡海作战不无若干困难，不过这些困难是可以克服的。我们已经消灭了蒋匪帮的精锐主力，现在残留在台湾的匪军，多半是由东北或西南败窜下来的残兵败卒，士气低落已极。此外我们解放台湾的事业，有全国人民及台湾人民的积极支持，而残匪不仅在台湾人民中是孤立的，而且残匪自己内部矛盾深刻。我们把握时机“灭此朝食”已不成问题。不过就战术上言，仍不应轻敌，仍须审慎将事，以避免无谓的牺牲。孙子说的好“谋定而后动、虑胜而后会”。关于解放台湾的技术问题，我们人民解放军富于作战经历，并有渡江经验。定有成竹在胸，指挥若定，不难一鼓荡平台岛残匪，无庸我们再作书生纸上之谈了。至就台湾内部情形而论，台胞三百年来，反帝国主义侵略压迫和反专制独裁的斗争，前仆后起，继续不断。直至三年前之“二·二八”惨案，都表现着一贯的革命的传统精神。这种精神实已形成克敌制胜之基石。但是，以往数十次革命的斗争，都得不到全国广大人民的助力，只靠孤军奋斗，不得不终于失败了。而今情形，则大大的不同了。台湾内部人民革命斗争的传统精神，在台湾民主自治同盟领导之下，表现着极度高涨，极度扩展。并已组成空前广泛的革命统一战线，加强内部抵抗力量。同时国内人民解放军，业经解放全国，正以排山倒海之势而临台湾。任何台岛上残匪或与残匪勾结之任何侵略势力，均不足以当此无坚不摧，无敌不克之大军。均将在此大军之前粉碎。所以时机一至，渡海作战，只要冲过所谓海上封锁线，台湾沿海很多地方都可登陆，配合着台湾内部人民革命组织的力量，外攻里应，台湾的解放，即在眼前了。所有蒋匪帮的元恶巨憝，非事先挟其主子美帝飞机逃向菲律宾等处，即将在人民之前授首了。今天全国各民主党派参加纪念“二·二八”，就意味着全国人民对于台湾问题一致协力解决，尤意味着全国人民对于台湾解放一致援助，促其早日实现。这是多么富有重大意义的一回事啊！
