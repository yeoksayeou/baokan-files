Mr. Chairman of the Central People's Government, Mr. Premier of the State Council, Ladies and Gentlemen:

　　Today, a new and significant page has been written in the history of Soviet-Chinese relations. Today, several documents of great historical significance have been signed – the Treaty of Friendship Alliance and Mutual Assistance, the Agreement on the Chinese Changchun Railway, Lushun, and Dalian, and the Agreement on a Loan – the news of the signing of these documents will be received with deep satisfaction not only by the people of the entire Soviet Union, but also by all friends of peace, democracy, and progress.

　　The Treaty of Friendship Alliance and Mutual Assistance and the above-mentioned agreements, based on the principles of respect for equality, national independence, and national sovereignty, consolidate the historical relations between the Soviet and Chinese peoples. The people of the Soviet Union have always held deep friendship and respect for the Chinese people, for the Chinese people's heroic struggle against feudal and imperialist oppression under the leadership of their leader Mao Zedong. The unwavering sympathy of the Soviet people for this struggle stems from the profound conviction expressed by the leader of the Soviet people, Stalin, as early as 1929: "Truth and justice are entirely on the side of the Chinese revolution."

　　Stalin then said: "That is why we sympathize now and will sympathize in the future with the Chinese revolution, with the struggle of the Chinese people to liberate themselves from the shackles of imperialism and to unite China into a whole country."

　　The Soviet people have consistently shown sympathy for the cause of liberation of the Chinese people. The Treaty of Friendship Alliance and Mutual Assistance between the Soviet and People’s Republic of China signed today precisely demonstrates the desire of our two peoples for the permanent friendship and cooperation between our two countries, and for the peace and security of all peoples.

　　The Agreement on the Chinese Changchun Railway, Lushun, and Dalian is of great and important significance. The agreement points out that the situation in the Far East has undergone fundamental changes since 1945, and these changes provide the possibility of re-addressing the issues of the Chinese Changchun Railway, Lushun, and Dalian. Every clause of this agreement proves the Soviet side's respect for the national independence and national interests of the Chinese people, and also proves the greatness of the principles of Soviet foreign policy.

　　The determination of our two peoples to develop and consolidate economic and cultural relations between the Soviet Union and China and to provide each other with economic assistance forms the basis of the agreement for the Soviet Union to grant the People's Republic of China a long-term economic loan.

　　The treaty and agreements between the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and the People's Republic of China signed today are a most significant contribution to consolidating the cause of peace and democracy throughout the world.

　　Mr. Chairman and Mr. Premier, please allow me to congratulate you here on the signing of these historic documents that consolidate our alliance and friendship.

　　May the alliance and friendship between the Soviet and Chinese peoples be increasingly consolidated and last forever!

### 苏联外交部长维辛斯基在签字式上的演说

　　苏联外交部长维辛斯基在签字式上的演说中央人民政府主席先生，政务院总理先生，各位先生：
    今天，在苏中两国关系的历史上，写下了新的显著的一页。今天，签订了几个具有重大历史意义的文件——友好同盟互助条约，关于中国长春铁路、旅顺口及大连的协定，关于贷款的协定——这几个文件的签订的消息，不仅将得到全苏联的人民，同时也将得到所有和平、民主与进步的友人们的深深的满意。
    友好同盟互助条约和上述的以尊重平等、国家独立与民族主权各原则为基础的协定，巩固了苏联人民与中国人民之间的历史关系。苏联的人民，对于中国的人民，对于中国人民在中国人民的领袖毛泽东领导之下的反对封建与帝国主义压迫的英勇解放斗争，一向是怀着深深的友谊与敬意的。苏联人民对于这个斗争的始终不渝的同情，是从这一深刻的信念出发，这就是苏联人民的领袖斯大林远在一九二九年曾说的：“真理和正义，完全是在中国革命的一方面。”
    斯大林当时又说过：“这就是为什么我们在现在和将来都同情中国的革命，同情中国人民自帝国主义的枷锁之下争取解放的斗争和将中国团结成为一个整个的国家。”
    苏联的人民对于中国人民的解放事业，始终不移地表现出自己的同情。今天所签订的苏联与中华人民共和国的友好同盟互助条约，就正表现出了我们两国人民对于我们两个国家的永久的友好与合作，以及对于各国人民的和平与安全所抱的愿望。
    关于中国长春铁路、旅顺口及大连的协定，是具有巨大而重要的意义的。在协定中指出，自一九四五年以来远东的形势已起了根本的变化，这些变化就提供了有从新处理中国长春铁路、旅顺口及大连诸问题的可能性。这种协定的每一条款，都证明了苏联方面对于中国人民的民族独立与民族权益的尊重，也证明了苏联外交政策原则的伟大。
    我们两国人民发展和巩固苏联与中国之间的经济与文化关系以及互相给予经济援助的决心，就成为苏联允许给予中华人民共和国以长期经济贷款协定的基础。
    今天所签订的苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟与中华人民共和国之间的条约及各项协定，对于巩固全世界的和平与民主的事业，是一个最重大的贡献。
    主席先生及总理先生，请允许我在此地向你们祝贺这几个巩固我们的同盟与友好的历史文件的签订。
    愿苏中两国人民之间的同盟与友好将日益巩固和永远长存下去！
