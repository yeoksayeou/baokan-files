Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, February 7th: The people of the Central South region, who suffered from the bacteriological weapons of the Japanese invaders during the eight-year War of Resistance against Japan, unanimously and resolutely support the Soviet government's proposal to try the main Japanese bacteriological warfare criminals.

Cheng Qian and Zhang Nanxian, Vice Chairmen of the Central South Military and Political Committee, believe that the Soviet proposal to submit Japanese Emperor Hirohito and others to a special international military tribunal is a demand of human justice. Anyone who opposes or obstructs it is a direct or indirect accomplice. They hope that a special international military tribunal can be organized quickly to try Japanese Emperor Hirohito and other war criminals. Huang Qixiang, Chen Mingren, Qiu Ao, and Liu Fei, members of the Central South Military and Political Committee, also made speeches, resolutely supporting the Soviet's just proposal. Qiu Ao said: I know very well about the Japanese war criminals using airplanes to spread plague germs in Changde. At that time, I was the acting director of the Hunan Provincial Refugee Relief Committee. We, the people of Hunan who have suffered from it, fully support the proposal in the Soviet note to hand over the war criminals involved in this heinous crime to a special international military tribunal for trial.

Hunan People Have Ironclad Facts as Proof; Japanese War Criminals Cannot Deny It

Lu Jingxuan, a doctor at Xiangya Hospital in Changsha, personally tested patients who died from the plague bacillus spread by the Japanese invaders in Changde in 1941. He said: At that time, I stained the liver juice of the deceased with fuchsine and methylene blue and examined it under a microscope. I found many small bacilli with bipolar staining, which could be clearly identified as plague bacilli. This ironclad fact cannot be denied by the Japanese war criminals. Today, the Chinese people have stood up and must settle this blood debt. The preparatory committee of the Hunan Provincial Federation of Trade Unions, the working committee of the Youth League, the preparatory committee of the Democratic Women's Federation, and other organizations such as the Changsha City Telecommunications Union, the Postal Union, the Democratic Women's Federation, and the Student Union have all issued circular telegrams and statements. The circular telegram from the preparatory committee of the Provincial Federation of Trade Unions stated: The workers of Hunan Province demand that the Japanese war criminals who used bacteria be given due punishment. The circular telegram from the Provincial Democratic Women's Federation pointed out: In order to save mankind from the disasters of war and disease, we resolutely support the Soviet's just proposal to try the bacteriological war criminals headed by the Japanese Emperor. The preparatory committee of the Jiangxi Provincial Federation of Trade Unions, the working committee of the Youth League, the preparatory committee of the Democratic Women's Federation, and the Student Union all issued statements on the same day, representing the workers, youth, women, and students of the province in warmly supporting the Soviet government's proposal and expressing that a special international military tribunal must be organized quickly to severely punish the inhumane and heinous war criminals such as Hirohito, in order to safeguard world peace and the interests of the people.

The New Hunan Daily and the Jiangxi Daily both published the Soviet government's note to our country regarding the trial of war criminals in prominent positions. The Hunan Daily also published a commentary, believing that the Soviet's note requesting the trial of Japanese bacteriological war criminals is a serious warning to the imperialist warmongers who are now inciting a new war.

Hirohito is Unpardonable and Should be Severely Sanctioned

Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, February 7th: The people of East China unanimously support the Soviet government's note to our government regarding the issue of Japanese bacteriological warfare criminals, and they have successively requested the prompt organization of a special international military tribunal to try the main war criminals headed by Hirohito. The Shanghai Municipal Workers' Representative Conference, which is currently being held, issued a statement stating: All the representatives of our Shanghai Municipal Workers' Representative Conference believe that this solemn proposal of the Soviet government fully demonstrates the highest reason and the deepest feelings of mankind, and therefore express our firm support. Relevant countries should promptly convene a special international military tribunal to severely sanction the wicked Japanese bacteriological war criminals headed by Hirohito. Shen Han, chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Engineering Union, said: Only by completely eliminating the Japanese imperialist war criminals and establishing a Japan belonging to the Japanese people can peace in the Far East be guaranteed. The city's film, theater, and art circles have also successively issued statements supporting the Soviet note.

People from all walks of life in Nanjing are filled with hatred for the crimes of Hirohito and others. More than ten organizations in the city, such as the Machinery Factory, the Joint Association of Teachers and Staff of Primary and Secondary Schools, and the Democratic Women's Federation, have successively issued written opinions, unanimously believing that the Soviet proposal is completely in line with the interests and wishes of the Chinese people. The Nanjing Office of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang and the Nanjing Branch of the China Democratic League also expressed the same opinion.

Workers, students, youth, women, and other organizations in Jinan, Shandong Province, unanimously believe that the Soviet government's note is a just proposal to defend world peace and human security. Li Lin, the person in charge of the Provincial Federation of Trade Unions, said: These inhumane Japanese bacteriological war criminals must be punished. Li Jianzhen, director of the Provincial Democratic Women's Federation, said: We fully support the Soviet government's note. In order to protect the survival rights and interests of women and children throughout the province and even the country and the world, we are even more willing to do everything in our power to make this proposal representing the interests of mankind a reality as soon as possible. The person in charge of the Standing Committee of the Qingdao Municipal People's Representative Conference stated in a speech: "We firmly support the Soviet's just proposal. The Japanese bacteriological war criminals headed by Hirohito must be given the punishment they deserve." Workers, students, cultural figures, women's groups, heads of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, professors, and others in the city have successively demanded the early trial of the main war criminals of the Japanese bacteriological war.

The Chinese People Have Suffered Poisoning; Oppose U.S. Imperialism's Protection of Japanese War Criminals

The preparatory committee of the Anhui North District Federation of Trade Unions in Hefei and other people's organizations such as the Democratic Youth League and the Women's Federation have successively issued written opinions, unanimously expressing their support for the Soviet proposal. They pointed out: Workers, youth, and women in northern Anhui suffered from the ravages and harm of Japanese fascists during the Japanese invasion of China. Therefore, the people of northern Anhui firmly oppose the U.S. government's criminal act of protecting Japanese war criminals. The persons in charge of the Xuzhou Municipal Federation of Trade Unions and the Democratic Youth League stated: Japanese bacteriological war criminals killed thousands of Chinese people through inhumane criminal experiments and must be severely punished. The city's Sino-Soviet Friendship Association and people from the business community all unanimously support the Soviet government's proposal to try Hirohito and others.

Newspapers in Shanghai, Nanjing, and other places have all published editorials on this matter, unanimously supporting the Soviet government's note and warning the U.S. government, which is protecting Japanese war criminals and plotting to launch a new war of aggression. An editorial in the Shanghai Jiefang Daily stated: We fully support the Soviet government's proposal to organize a special international military tribunal to try the bacteriological war criminals headed by Hirohito. A Dagong Bao commentary said: Hirohito's participation in preparing the secret bacteriological war has now been fully revealed, and this heinous crime cannot be escaped. We fully support the Soviet's proposal and will not allow the U.S. government to protect Japanese war criminals.
