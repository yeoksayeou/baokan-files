Shanxi Provincial People's Government Circular
    Improving Rural Primary School Environments

    [Reported by this newspaper] The Shanxi Provincial People's Government recently issued a circular to governments at all levels under its jurisdiction, urging them to pay attention to improving the environments of rural primary schools located in temples. It also instructed primary school teachers not to use "maxims," idioms, etc., containing feudal and superstitious toxins in their teaching. The circular stated: According to a recent inspection report by the provincial government's inspection team in Yuci, Taigu, Xugou, and other counties, many rural primary schools are located in ancient temples. Statues of deities and plaques have not yet been removed. The plaques retain superstitious phrases such as "Divine Power is Manifest" and "Prayers are Immediately Answered." At the same time, many teachers are still following old practices. When writing "introductory maxims" for students, they quote phrases from "Zhu Zi's Family Maxims" and other statements that instill feudal morality; or quote absurd verses (such as one teacher writing: "The prince went to seek immortality, the elixir achieved, he ascended to the Ninth Heaven. Seven days in the cave, thousands of years in the world."). The circular pointed out that these feudal and superstitious things greatly poison the healthy development of children's minds. For this reason, the provincial government made the following decisions: (1) Efforts should be made to educate and persuade the masses to remove the wooden puppets and statues of deities in ancient temples where schools are located as soon as possible. Plaques in the temples can be converted into blackboards, desks, and benches, etc., or replaced with new content. We must truly transform temples into school environments. (2) When teachers write "introductory maxims" for children or slogans for schools, they must be suitable for children's needs, conform to the content of new education, and try to combine them with classroom teaching, consciously cultivating good ideological habits in children. Oppose the use of phrases containing feudal and superstitious toxins. It is even more important to oppose the phenomenon of teaching children to recite the "Three Character Classic" and "Thousand Character Classic."

　　山西省人民政府通令
    改善农村小学环境
    【本报讯】山西省人民政府顷通令所属各级政府，注意改善设立在寺庙中的农村小学的环境。并教育小学教员，在教学中不得引用含有封建、迷信毒素的“格言”、成语等。通令称：据省府视导组最近在榆次、太谷、徐沟等县检查报告：不少农村小学设立在古庙内。神像、匾牌尚未除去。匾牌上保留着“神灵显赫”、“一祷即应”等迷信词句。同时，不少教员还在因袭旧的作法。给学生写“引格”时，引用“朱子治家格言”等灌输封建道德的语句；或引用荒诞的诗句（如有的教员写着：“王子去求仙，丹成上九天。洞中方七日，世上几千年。”）。通令指出：这些封建、迷信的东西，大大毒害儿童心理的健全发展。为此，省府作出决定：（一）凡设立学校之古庙内的木偶、神像，应尽量教育说服群众早日除去。庙内匾牌可改做黑板、桌、凳等，或换写新的内容。要把庙宇真正改变为学校环境。（二）教员给儿童写“引格”或给学校写标语，必须适合儿童需要，符合新教育内容，尽量与课堂教课相结合，有意识地培养儿童良好的思想习惯。反对引用含有封建、迷信毒素的词句。更要反对教儿童念“三字经”“千字文”等现象。
