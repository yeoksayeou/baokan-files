Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, February 16th: The All-China Soviet Friendship Association received letters from students across the Soviet Union addressed to Chinese students. One of these was from students of the Thirty-First Girls' Middle School in Gorky City. The full text is as follows:

Dear friends, boys and girls of distant China, Greetings!

This letter is written to you by Soviet middle school girls, students of the Thirty-First Girls' Middle School in Gorky City. We are delighted to learn that your great people have taken power into their own hands, driven out the greedy traitor Chiang Kai-shek, and declared the establishment of the People's Republic of China.

Our people's wise leaders, Lenin and Stalin, predicted this long ago. Our parents and ourselves have watched every step of China's heroic struggle with extreme excitement, and when we learned of the great victory of the Chinese people, our joy was simply beyond words. People's China is another step towards building a new communist world, a world of justice and human happiness.

Thirty-two years ago, our motherland, like China not long ago, was also such an enslaved country. Tsars, landlords, and capitalists ruled Russia.

	Year after year, the farmer tills the soil,
	Sowing, milling,
	But the farmer's bread falls
	Onto the landlord's table.

	In the cities,
	Those who work,
	Likewise work for the rich masters,
	Year after year,
	Their whole lives, before being buried in the grave.

However, the great leaders of the working people, Lenin and Stalin, led our people in struggle. On November 7, 1917, the victorious red flag rose over our land, and the country came to be managed by its present masters—the workers and peasants. After thirty-two years, our motherland has become unrecognizable: dozens of new cities, thousands of factories have grown up, villages and hamlets have changed, new roads have been laid, and even some places that previously had no seas, no forests, no rivers, now have them. And how many of our specialized schools, middle and primary schools, theaters, and museums there are! All of this was built by the people, and is for the people, for us. Everyone in our country has the right to work (we do not know what unemployment is), the right to rest, and the right to education. We have no illiteracy; everyone studies.

The Communist Party and the great Stalin are particularly concerned about us children. We have beautiful schools, and excellent buildings in the city are given to us—these are our Young Pioneer Palaces. We join various group activities: music, choir, dance, literature, history, natural sciences, young technicians, etc., depending on each person's hobbies and interests. Every summer, we rest in the scenic places of our motherland, in Young Pioneer summer camps and summer resorts—in the forests, in the mountains, and by the sea. It is impossible to tell you everything in one letter. And now your motherland—the long-suffering China—will also embark on the road to the happiness of all nations, on our road.

We are confident that the Chinese Communist Party, under the leadership of the great Mao Zedong, is leading your country to victory. You will easily walk this path: you have the Soviet Union as a friend, which always helps the people who are building socialism.

Dear friends, we are eager to establish friendly correspondence with you. We would very much like to know: how Chinese children are helping their fathers in the heroic struggle against the remnants of the Kuomintang, how you study and live, whether you have Young Pioneers and Communist Youth League members, and what you are doing now. Tell us about your beloved leaders, great scholars, and writers. We know very little about the lives and works of revolutionary writers such as Lu Xun, Guo Moruo, Mao Dun, and Ding Ling. Please write about them. And we will tell you about our school life, the activities of our Young Pioneers and Communist Youth League members, how we learn to become loyal Leninists and Stalinists, our outstanding figures—Heroes of the Soviet Union and Heroes of Socialist Labor, the great sons of our people, Lenin and Stalin, as well as outstanding Russian generals, writers, and scholars.

We live in a city named after the great proletarian writer Maxim Gorky. The little house where he spent his childhood is not far from our school. We will write to you about the Volga River, on which our city stands. This is one of the most glorious rivers in the world. Lenin was born on the banks of the Volga River. Along the Volga River, there are many beautiful cities, and our Gorky City is one of them. But we will tell you about all of this next time.

Once again, we sincerely congratulate you on your great victory, shake your brotherly hands, and eagerly await a reply.

Write us everything—we are interested in everything. We wish you success in all your endeavors and plans.

Your friends in the Soviet Union—the students of the Thirty-First Girls' Middle School in Gorky City
November 12, 1949

Our address is: USSR, Gorky Oblast, Gorky City, 62 Gochili Street, School Number 31.

### 真挚的友爱真挚的心  苏联高尔基城第三十一女中学生给中国学生的信

　　真挚的友爱真挚的心
    苏联高尔基城第三十一女中学生给中国学生的信
    【新华社北京十六日电】中苏友好协会总会日前收到苏联各地学生寄给中国学生的信件中，有一封是高尔基城第三十一女中学生的来信，全文如下：亲爱的朋友们，遥远中国的男女小朋友们，你们好！
    这封信是苏联女中学生，高尔基城第三十一女中学生们，写给你们的。我们以欢乐的心情得知你们伟大的人民已将政权掌握在自己手中，赶走了贪欲的卖国贼蒋介石，宣布成立了中华人民共和国。
    我们人民的英明领袖列宁和斯大林早就预言到了这点。我们的父母和我们自己都极端兴奋地注视中国英勇斗争的每一步，而当我们得知伟大中国人民获得胜利的时候，我们的欢欣简直难以用语句来表达。人民的中国——是走向建立新的共产主义的世界、正义和人类幸福的世界的又一步。
    三十二年以前，我们的祖国，和中国不久前一样，也是那样被奴役的国家，沙皇、地主和资本家统治着俄国。
    农夫年复一年地耕田，
    播种，磨粉，
    而农夫的面包却落到
    地主的桌子上。
    在城市里
    工作的人，
    同样地为阔人老爷们工作，
    一年又一年，
    自己整个一生，在埋入坟墓以前。
    但是，劳动人民的伟大领袖列宁和斯大林领导我们人民作斗争。一九一七年十一月七日，在我们土地上升起了胜利的红旗，国家遂为它现在的主人——工人与农民所管理。我们的祖国经过三十二年后已变得难以辨认了：几十座新的城市，数千所工厂成长起来了，乡村和村庄改变了，新的道路敷设了，甚至有些地方以前没有大海、没有森林、没有河流，现在都有了。而我们的专科学校、中小学校、剧院和博物馆又有多少啊！所有这些是人民所建立，并是为人民、为我们而建立的。我国每一个人都有劳动权（我们不知道什么是失业）、休息权以及受教育的权利，我们没有文盲，人人都学习。
    共产党和伟大的斯大林特别关怀我们儿童们。我们有美丽的学校，城市中极好的大厦给了我们——这是我们的少先宫，我们加入各种的团体活动：音乐、合唱团、舞蹈、文学、历史、自然科学、少年技工等等，这是依每个人的嗜好和兴趣而定的。每年夏天，我们在祖国景色秀丽的地方休息，在少先队夏令营和消夏处——在林中、在丛山中和海滨。不能在一封信中一下子告诉你们所有的一切。而现在你们的祖国——受难深重的中国，也将走上到各民族幸福的道路，走我们的道路。
    我们确信，中国共产党在伟大的毛泽东领导之下正在引导贵国走向胜利。你们将很容易地走这条道路：你们有着苏联这个朋友，它总是帮助那建设社会主义的人民的。
    亲爱的朋友们，我们亟愿和你们建立友谊的通信联系。我们很想知道：中国儿童们如何在反对国民党残余的英勇斗争中帮助自己父亲，你们如何学习和生活，你们中有没有少先队员和共青团员，你们现在作些什么。告诉我们关于你们爱戴的领袖、伟大的学者和作家。我们对那些革命作家如鲁迅、郭沫若、茅盾、丁玲等的生活和创作知道得还很少。请写一写关于他们的事吧。而我们将告诉你们我们的学校生活，我们少先队员和共青团员的事业，我们如何学习成为忠诚的列宁和斯大林主义者，我们的优秀人物——苏联英雄和社会主义劳动英雄，我们人民的伟大儿子列宁和斯大林，以及卓越的俄国将领、作家和学者。
    我们住在以伟大的无产阶级作家马克西姆·高尔基为名的城市中。他渡过自己童年的那座小屋子，离开我们学校不远。我们将写伏尔加河给你们，我们城市便是在这条河边上。这是世界上最光荣的河流之一。列宁便生在伏尔加河畔。沿着伏尔加河有许多美丽的城市，我们的高尔基城就是其中之一。但是，关于这一切，我们将在下次告诉你们。
    我们再一次衷心地祝贺你们伟大的胜利，紧握你们兄弟般的手，并急切地等候回音。
    把所有一切都写给我们吧——我们对什么都感兴趣。祝你们在一切事业和计划中都成功。
    你们在苏联的朋友们——高尔基城第三十一女中的学生
                                一九四九年十一月十二日写
    我们的地址是：苏联，高尔基省高尔基城，戈奇里街六十二号，第三十一学校。
