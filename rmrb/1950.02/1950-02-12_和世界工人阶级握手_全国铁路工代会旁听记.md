　　Shaking Hands with the World's Working Class
    ——A Record of Observing the National Railway Workers' Congress
    By Our Reporter Chen Ji
    International Organization of Transport Workers
    On February 9th, Comrade Ye Keming, the Chinese railway representative attending the World Conference of Land and Air Transport Workers, reported on the proceedings of the conference at the National Railway Workers' Congress. This conference is of great significance for developing and strengthening cooperation among workers of various countries and international solidarity.
    The reactionary leaders of the British Trades Union Congress and the American Congress of Industrial Organizations attempted to undermine the World Federation of Trade Unions' important resolution to establish industrial departments. This conspiracy finally suffered a shameful defeat at the Second World Congress of the World Federation of Trade Unions held in Milan last year. In less than half a year after the Second World Congress of the World Federation of Trade Unions decided to establish industrial departments and form international organizations of various industrial unions, the First World Conference of Land and Air Transport Workers, representing seven million transport workers worldwide, opened in Bucharest, the capital of Romania, on December 10th last year. Delegations from eleven countries, including the Soviet Union, China, Germany (East Germany), Italy, Romania, Czechoslovakia, Poland, Hungary, Bulgaria, and Korea, totaling sixty-three people, participated in the conference. Comrade Rostovky, Deputy Secretary of the World Federation of Trade Unions, also attended the meeting to provide guidance. Transport worker organizations from Australia, Albania, the Netherlands, Tunisia, and other countries sent telegrams explaining the reasons for their inability to attend the conference and expressing their sincere support for the conference. The conference resolved to recognize their participation in the International Organization of Land and Air Transport Unions.
    The Chinese delegation attending this conference included Ye Keming (chief representative, Tianjin railway worker representative, Standing Committee member of the National Railway Federation Preparatory Committee), Kang Guochen (Northeast railway worker representative), Li Yong (driver of the "Mao Zedong" locomotive), Chen Xingsheng (Shanghai railway worker representative), Chen Jinsheng (North China highway transport worker representative), Liu Peihuan (logistics motor transport worker representative), and Chen E (secretary and translator). The conference heard reports from delegations from eight countries, including the Soviet Union, China, Poland, Bulgaria, France, Romania, Italy, and Germany. Delegations from the Soviet Union and various new democratic countries described the continuous improvement in the lives of land and air transport workers in their countries and their great achievements in participating in peaceful construction, while delegations from capitalist countries complained about their lives of slavery—the misery of being exploited and devastated—and the deeds of workers' heroic struggles. The conference repeatedly and endlessly cheered for Stalin and sent a telegram to congratulate Marshal Stalin on his 70th birthday, fully demonstrating the world's transport workers' respect and concern for the revolutionary teacher of mankind. The Soviet delegation's active speeches were warmly praised by representatives from various countries. The entire working class around the world is grateful to the Soviet Union and for the Soviet Union's loyalty and contribution to the international workers' revolutionary cause. Comrade Shevchenko, the chief representative of the Soviet Union, said: "We must unite and strive for workers' organizations from countries that have not joined the World Federation of Trade Unions to participate in our World Federation of Trade Unions, and we must all assume this international obligation."
    On December 14th last year, the conference elected eight administrative committee members—one each from the Soviet Union, China, France, Germany, Romania, Italy, Poland, and Czechoslovakia—to form the administrative committee, and reserved three vacancies for transport worker organizations in South America, Africa, and Anglo-American capitalist countries. Comrade Li Jiebo, Director of the Preparatory Committee of the All-China Railway Workers' Union, was elected as a member. Comrade Drula from Germany was the chairman. Comrade Molaru from Romania was the general secretary. The administrative committee is located in Bucharest, the capital of Romania. That evening, the closing ceremony was held, and the charter and declaration of the International Land and Air Transport Union were adopted, and a telegram was sent to the World Federation of Trade Unions to express respect. The conference pointed out that the main tasks of land and air transport workers around the world in the future are: (1) to strengthen the unity and unification of land and air transport workers around the world; (2) to strive for all land and air transport worker organizations in capitalist countries and colonial and semi-colonial countries that have not joined the World Federation of Trade Unions to join the World Federation of Trade Unions, enhance the strength of the anti-imperialist camp, and strive for lasting world peace and people's democracy; (3) to protect the economic and social interests of land and air transport workers.
    Enthusiastic Welcomes Everywhere
    From Beijing to Bucharest, the capital of Romania, is more than 10,000 kilometers. When the train carrying the Chinese worker representatives entered the first city on the Romanian border, Iasi, the representatives saw the five-star red flag of the People's Republic of China flying on Romanian soil, and a giant statue of Chairman Mao hanging in a prominent place at Iasi Station. The mayor of Iasi and people's organizations from all walks of life were already waiting at the station. When the Chinese representatives appeared before them, cheers of "Mao—Ze—Dong" were endless. Upon arriving in Bucharest, they encountered the same warm welcome. The conference even decided to adjourn for a day to wait for the arrival of the Chinese representatives. At numerous banquets, mass meetings, and visits to Romanian factories and schools, Chinese worker representatives were often surrounded by enthusiastic crowds. When Chinese representatives walked on the street, Romanian residents often ran up to shake hands and said, "I love you, China!" Leaders of the Romanian Workers' Party, the Prime Minister, the Mayor of Bucharest, the Romanian Ministry of Railways, and the Railway Federation of Trade Unions hosted receptions for representatives from various countries on three separate occasions. At each banquet, the seats of the Chinese representatives were placed near the chairman. After inviting representatives from China, the Soviet Union, France, and Korea to a banquet, the General Secretary of the Romanian Workers' Party, Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej, specially invited the Chinese and Korean representatives for another conversation. Romanian newspapers frequently published news about the victory of the Chinese people. Journalists scrambled to inquire about materials related to China. A young Romanian journalist said to a Chinese railway worker representative: "I am writing a literary work on the Chinese question." The Romanian waiter who served the Chinese representatives greatly admired the victorious China. He said, "China is a big country, and the victory of 475 million people is of great significance for world peace."
    The Magnificent Strength of Soviet Railway Workers
    After attending the World Conference of Land and Air Transport Workers, Chinese railway worker representatives visited Moscow to observe the general situation of Soviet railway construction.
    Thirty to fifty meters below the ground in Moscow, Soviet railway workers built three new-style railways totaling forty kilometers in length. Every day, electric trains carry more than 1.5 million passengers at a speed of 60 kilometers per hour in the bright Moscow underground. The train tracks here have ventilation equipment, and the air is very smooth. Each major station has automatic escalator-style elevators, so passengers can get on and off the train without any effort. Each train pulls six carriages, and trains run every three minutes at noon and at night, and every two minutes in the morning and evening. The doors of the train can be opened and closed automatically. Passengers can simply put five kopecks into the automatic ticket vending machine at the station and roam around on the line at will. The walls of the twenty-nine underground railway stations are carved with giant statues of labor heroes and combat heroes, and different kinds of lighting illuminate the green and light yellow walls, making them look magnificent and splendid. This scene is truly amazing. The Soviet people have created an unprecedented miracle. We all remember the barbaric atrocities of the German fascist invasion of the Soviet Union a few years ago. At that time, the German army used road breakers, airplanes, and landmines to destroy the railways of the Soviet people: 65,000 kilometers of lines were completely destroyed, 14,000 locomotives and 400,000 carriages were damaged, 13,000 bridges were destroyed, and countless stations, sections, and machine factories were turned into rubble. Some stations were subjected to the destructive bombing of 60,000 bombs. However, the great Soviet railway workers, with unparalleled heroism, carried guns on their left shoulders and dug soil with their right hands, and rushed to repair the railways under the rain of bullets. When the war had just ended, all the damaged railways were completely restored to traffic. This brilliant achievement demonstrates the invincible great strength of the Soviet people. The Dnieper River Railway Bridge is one kilometer long, with each steel beam being 35 meters long and weighing 120 tons. This bridge had been completely destroyed by the enemy. The heroic Soviet railway workers, under constant obstruction from enemy planes, repaired it at a speed of 86 meters every 24 hours, and completely restored it in 13 days, creating an amazing record. The highest record for repairing railway bridges in a peaceful environment in the United States is only 51 meters per hour. During the great war to defend Leningrad, Leningrad was surrounded by the enemy and had no supply of rice, electricity, or coal for 125 days, which caused serious difficulties. In order to support the war, Soviet railway workers fought against the mud and marsh water in the lake area outside Leningrad and built a supply line from the swamp, which played an indelible role in defeating the enemy in Leningrad. While rushing to repair railways, Soviet railway workers also created new records in manufacturing locomotives. They produced the "Hercules" type locomotive with a traction of 2,500 tons and a speed of 130 kilometers per hour, and they also created the "152" type locomotive with a traction of 3,500 to 4,000 tons and a speed of 90 kilometers per hour. The locomotive traveling in the desert area can travel 1,000 kilometers in the desert area with only 13 tons of water, which is also their new invention.
    Soviet railway workers created brilliant achievements in defeating the German fascist war. In the post-war production and construction, they have invested in a vigorous socialist competition. Ninety percent of railway workers in the Soviet Union participated in the competition. The scope of competition has developed from person to person, group to group, section to section, to division to division, and bureau to bureau. The transportation task for 1949 was completed in November. Workers from the Stalin locomotive section and the Lazanski locomotive section told the visiting Chinese railway workers: "We are doing the work of 1952." The work of some lathe workers exceeded 14 years' worth of tasks. The entire Lazanski locomotive section exceeded the original task by 183%. When accepting tasks, railway workers throughout the Soviet Union did not just guarantee the completion of the task, but said that they would guarantee exceeding the task by a certain amount. Now they are enthusiastically launching the 500-kilometer daily locomotive mileage movement. Comrade Brazhnov, the initiator of the 500-kilometer movement, said to Comrade Li Yong, the driver of the Chinese Mao Zedong locomotive, during a conversation: "The Soviet Ministry of Railways stipulates that the daily locomotive mileage is 333 kilometers. Our 'P type 450' locomotive's entire crew put forward the slogan of '500 kilometers', and we have completely achieved it with everyone's efforts. This movement quickly developed, and ten locomotives in the Lazanski locomotive section traveled 500 kilometers." When Comrade Li Yong asked him what made it possible for the locomotive to travel 500 kilometers, he simply said: "(1) The crew loves and cherishes the locomotive as they love their own lives; (2) They are familiar with the line; (3) They work hard to learn technology; (4) They try to shorten the time for stopping at each station, giving water, and loading coal; (5) They maintain close contact with various units and cooperate well."
    In the socialist competition, 80 to 90% of the workers in some railway factories have obtained the title of Stakhanovite workers. As for honorary drivers and honorary stationmasters, there are too many to count. Railway workers throughout the Soviet Union have more widely and frequently launched the rationalization proposal movement. In 1948 alone, Soviet railway workers put forward more than 71,000 rationalization proposals. As a result of the adoption of rationalization proposals by the Soviet railways, the entire Soviet railway saved 500 million rubles.
    The brilliant achievements of Soviet railway workers are certainly not just these mentioned above. However, based on these situations alone, we can clearly see that under the wise leadership of Marshal Stalin, Soviet railway workers are advancing victoriously with their great heroic spirit, constantly providing new encouragement to Chinese railway workers, strengthening our confidence in building people's railways, and pointing out the future prospects of our railway construction.

　　和世界工人阶级握手
    ——全国铁路工代会旁听记

    运输工人的国际组织
    二月九日，出席世界陆空运输工人会议的中国铁路代表叶克明同志在全国铁路工会代表大会上，报告世界陆空运输工人会议的经过情形。这个会议对于发展并加强各国工人合作及国际团结是有重大意义的。
    英国职工大会与美国产业职工大会的反动领袖们，曾企图破坏世界工联建立产业部的重要决议。这个阴谋终于在去年米兰召开世界工联第二次代表大会上遭受了可耻的失败。在世界工联二次代表大会决定建立产业部，成立各种产业工会国际以后，不到半年的时间，代表着全世界七百万运输工人的第一次世界陆空运输工人会议于去年十二月十日在罗马尼亚首都布加勒斯特开幕了。参加这个会议的有苏、中、德（东德）、意、罗、捷、波、匈、保、鲜等十一国的代表团，共六十三人。世界工联副书记罗斯托夫斯基同志亦莅会指导。奥大利亚、阿尔巴尼亚、荷兰、突尼斯等国运输工人组织均以电报说明他们未能参加大会的原因，并表示他们对大会的竭诚拥护。大会决议承认他们参加陆空运输工会国际组织。
    出席这个会议的我国代表有叶克明（首席代表，天津铁路工人代表，全国铁总筹委会常委）、康国辰（东北铁路工人代表）、李永（毛泽东号司机长）、陈杏生（上海铁路工人代表）、陈进升（华北公路运输工人代表）、刘培焕（后勤汽车运输工人代表）、陈鄂（秘书翻译）等七人。大会听取了苏、中、波、保、法、罗、意、德等八国代表团的报告。苏联和各新民主主义国家代表团叙述了他们国家的陆空运输工人生活的不断改善的事实及参加和平建设的伟大成绩，而资本主义国家代表团则申诉了他们的奴隶生活——被剥削被摧残的惨象以及工人英勇斗争的事迹。大会多次久经不息地欢呼斯大林，并电贺斯大林大元帅七十寿辰，充分表现了世界运输工人对于人类革命导师的敬仰与关怀。苏联代表团的积极发言，获得了各国代表的热烈赞扬。全世界工人阶级都感谢苏联，感谢苏联对于国际工人革命事业的忠诚与贡献。苏联首席代表谢夫谦珂同志说：“我们要团结并争取未参加世界工联组织的国家的工人团体来参加我们的世界工联，我们都要负起这个国际的义务。”
    去年十二月十四日，大会选出了八个行政委员——苏、中、法、德、罗、意、波、捷各一人，成立行政委员会，并留空额三人给南美洲、非洲和英美资本主义国家的运输工人团体。中国铁路总工会筹备委员主任李颉伯同志当选为委员。德国得鲁拉同志为主席。罗马尼亚模拉鲁同志为总书记。行政委员会设于罗马尼亚首都——布加勒斯特。是晚举行闭幕大会，通过了陆空运输工会国际章程及宣言，并向世界工联致电表示敬意。大会并指出今后世界陆空运输工人的主要任务是：（一）加强世界陆空运输工人的团结和统一；（二）争取资本主义国家和殖民地半殖民国家内一切未加入世界工联的陆空运输工人团体加入世界工联，增强反对帝国主义阵营的力量，为争取世界持久和平与人民民主而奋斗；（三）保卫陆空运输工人经济和社会的利益。
    到处是热烈的欢迎
    从北京到罗马尼亚首都布加勒斯特，长达一万多公里。当火车载着中国工人代表踏进罗马尼亚边境第一个城市——亚士的时候，代表们就看见了中华人民共和国的五星红旗飘扬在罗马尼亚的土地上，毛主席的巨像高挂在亚士车站的显著地方。亚士市市长和各界人民团体都早已在车站迎候，当中国代表出现在他们面前时，“毛—泽—东”的欢呼声不绝于耳。到达布加勒斯特，也遇到同样的热烈欢迎。大会为了等候中国代表的到来，甚至决定休会一天。在屡次宴会，群众会及参观罗马尼亚工厂学校时，中国工人代表经常被热情的群众所包围。当中国代表在街上走路时，常常有罗马尼亚居民跑来握手，同时还说道：“我爱你们中国！”罗马尼亚工人党领袖、国务总理以及布加勒斯特市长罗马尼亚铁道部和铁路总工会先后三次宴请各国代表。每次宴会时，中国代表的席位都列在主席的近边。罗马尼亚工人党总书记戴士在邀请中、苏、法、鲜四国代表宴会以后，还特别又一次邀请中国和朝鲜代表谈话。罗马尼亚的报纸经常刊登关于中国人民胜利的消息。有关中国的材料，新闻记者争相询问。有个罗马尼亚的年青记者对中国铁路工人代表说：“我正在写中国问题的文学。”招待中国代表的罗马尼亚的服务员非常羡慕胜利的中国，他说：“中国是个大国，四万万七千五百万人民的胜利，对于全世界和平有着重大意义。”
    苏联铁路工人的雄伟力量
    中国铁路工人代表参加了世界陆空运输工人会议之后，曾在莫斯科参观了苏联铁路建设的概状。
    离莫斯科地面三十公尺至五十公尺深的地道里，苏联铁路工人建筑了三条长达四十公里的新型铁路。每天电气火车载着一百五十多万乘客，以每小时六十公里的速度飞驶在亮堂堂的莫斯科地下。这里的火车道，有着通风的设备，空气非常畅通。各大车站都有自动梯式的电梯，旅客们上下车毫不费力。每个火车牵引着六辆车厢，中午和夜间每隔三分钟就有一次列车驶过，早晚每隔两分钟就有一次车。车门都能自动开关。旅客们只要把五角卢布放在车站的自动售票机里，就可以任意在线路上游逛。列车里没有车长和服务员，旅客们都自觉遵守纪律，秩序井然，没有拥挤的现象。二十九个地下铁道车站的墙壁上，雕刻有劳动英雄和战斗英雄们的巨像，还有不同样巴的灯光照耀着碧绿淡黄的四壁，显得堂皇华丽。这种情景，真使人惊奇不已。苏维埃人民创造了史无前例的奇迹。我们都还记得几年前德寇法西斯疯狂进犯苏联的野蛮暴行。那时候，德寇用破路机，用飞机和地雷毁坏着苏联人民的铁路：六万五千公里的线路尽被破坏，一万四千辆机车和四十万辆车皮遭受损坏，一万三千座桥梁被摧残，无数个站、段和机厂变成瓦砾堆，有的车站曾遇到六万枚炸弹的毁灭性的轰炸。但是伟大的苏联铁路工人以无比的英勇精神，左肩扛着枪，右手挖着土，在枪林弹雨之下抢修铁路。当战争刚刚结束，全部被损坏的铁路完全恢复了通车。这辉煌的成就，显示了苏联人民不可战胜的伟大力量。德聂伯河铁路大桥有一公里长，每个钢梁长三十五公尺重一百二十吨。这个桥曾被敌人彻底破坏。英勇的苏联铁路工人在敌机不断的阻挠下，以每二十四小时修复八十六公尺的速度，在十三天内全部把它修复，创造了惊人的纪录。在和平环境下的美国修复铁桥的最高纪录，每小时也不过是五十一公尺。在保卫列宁格勒的伟大战争中，列宁格勒被敌人包围，一百二十五天没有米粮、电、煤的供给，发生严重困难。苏联铁路工人为了支援战争，就在列宁格勒外围的湖泽区，和泥泞沼水作斗争，从水沼上修成了一条补给线路，对于战胜列宁格勒的敌人起了不可磨灭的功绩。在抢修铁路的同时，苏联铁路工人在制造机车方面也创造了新的纪录。他们制出了二千五百吨的牵引力和每小时走一百三十公里的歇斯叶斯型机车，他们又创造了三千五百吨到四千吨牵引力和每时走九十公里的一五二型机车。在沙漠地带行走的机车，只要带着十三吨水，就可以在沙漠地带上走行一千公里，这也是他们新的发明。
    苏联铁路工人在击败德寇法西斯战争中，曾创造了灿烂的功绩；在战后的生产建设中，更投入了如火如荼的社会主义竞赛。全苏联百分之九十铁路工人参加了竞赛。竞赛的范围由人与人、组与组、段与段发展至处与处、局与局的竞赛了。一九四九年的运输任务，十一月即已完成。斯大林机务段和来赞斯基机务段的工人们向参观的中国铁路工人说：“我们在做一九五二年的工作。”有个镟工的工作却超过了十四年的任务。来赞斯基机务段全段工作超过原定任务百分之一百八十三。全苏联铁路工人接受任务时，不只是保证任务完成，而是说要保证超过任务多少。现在他们正热烈展开日车公里五百公里的运动，五百公里运动的发动者——司机布拉日诺夫同志在和中国毛泽东号司机长李永同志谈话时，说道：“苏联铁道部规定日车公里为三百三十三公里，我们‘Ｐ型四五○号’机车全体工人，提出了‘五百公里’的口号，在大伙儿努力下，完全做到了。这个运动随即迅速开展，来赞斯基机务段就有十台机车，跑到了五百公里。”当李永同志问他这是什么原因能使机车走行五百公里呢？他很简单地说：“（一）乘务员热心爱护机车，像爱自己生命一样；（二）熟悉线路；（三）努力学好技术；（四）尽量缩短各站停车、给水、上煤时间；（五）与各单位密切联系，很好配合。”
    在社会主义竞赛中，有的铁路工厂百分之八九十的工人获得斯达哈诺夫工作者的称号。至于荣誉司机、荣誉站长，更是不胜枚举。全苏联铁路工人更广泛地经常地开展了合理化建议运动。一九四八年一年当中，苏联铁路工人提出的合理化建议共达七万一千多件。由于苏联铁路采取合理化建议的结果，全苏联铁路节省了五万万卢布。
    苏联铁路工人的辉煌成就，当然不只是上面所述的这一些。然而仅就这些情形，我们就可以很明显地看到了苏联铁路工人在斯大林大元帅的英明领导下，正以其伟大的英雄气概，不断地向前胜利迈进，不断地给我们中国铁路工人以新的鼓舞，加强我们建设人民铁道的胜利信心，指出我们未来铁路建设的远景。
