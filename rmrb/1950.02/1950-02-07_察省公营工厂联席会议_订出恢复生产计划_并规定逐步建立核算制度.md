Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 3rd: Zhangjiakou News: The industrial production plan for Chahar Province this year has been adopted by the joint conference of factory directors of public factories in Chahar Province, held from the 22nd to the 24th of last month. Based on the existing industrial foundation and the overall economic situation of Chahar Province, the general guideline for this year's production and construction in the province is to focus on restoration and repair, with conditional development. In terms of organizational leadership, the main task of the Chahar Province Industry Department is to directly lead and manage the provincial factories, and to guide the state-owned enterprises in the province, manage and support the production units of government agencies, and private enterprises. Chahar Province is rich in coal and iron reserves, and the quality is also good, making it an important heavy industrial area in North China. At the same time, because the province is rich in agricultural products such as grain, mountain products, medicinal materials, ephedra, fur, eggs, sesame, pig bristles, and rice straw, it has favorable conditions for the development of light industry. The industrial production plan for Chahar Province this year has determined to restore and develop mechanical oil extraction, flour, pharmaceutical and other processing and manufacturing industries, expand the Zhangyuan Vegetable Oil Factory and Xinsheng Flour Factory, and build new flour factories and ephedrine, sodium sulfide and other factories in Datong and Zhangyuan. Zhangyuan's cigarette, alcohol, rubber and other factories, and Datong's match factory, are currently planning to improve equipment and improve quality due to limitations in raw materials, sales and machine conditions, so as to maintain the status quo temporarily. For factories such as glassware and food, which are currently difficult to maintain the status quo but have development prospects in the future, it is planned to temporarily reduce the scope. In order to overcome waste, reduce costs, and improve product quality and quantity, the plan stipulates that each factory should gradually establish an economic accounting system, carry out a production and frugality movement, and specifically requires light industrial manufacturing to reduce costs by 15% to 20% this year, and processing and manufacturing to reduce costs by 10% to 15%.

　　察省公营工厂联席会议
    订出恢复生产计划
    并规定逐步建立核算制度
    【新华社北京三日电】张家口讯：察省今年度的工业生产计划，已由上月二十二日至二十四日召开的察省公营工厂厂长联席会议通过。根据察省现有工业基础和整个经济情况，该省今年生产建设的总方针是以恢复修建为主，并作有条件的发展。在组织领导上，察省工业厅的主要任务是直接领导管理省营各工厂；并指导该省的国营企业，管理扶植机关生产单位和私营企业。察省煤铁藏量丰富，质量亦佳，是华北重要重工业区。同时，由于该省盛产粮食、山货、药材、麻黄、皮毛、鸡蛋、胡麻、猪鬃、稻草等农产品，具备有发展轻工业的有利条件。察省今年工业生产计划已确定恢复与发展机制榨油、面粉、制药等加工制造业，扩大张垣植物油厂、欣生面粉厂，并在大同、张垣新建面粉厂及麻黄素、硫化碱等工厂。张垣的香烟、酒精、橡胶等厂和大同的火柴厂，因受原料、销路和机器条件等限制，现拟改善设备、提高质量，做到暂维现状。对目前不易维持现状而将来又有发展前途的料器、食品等工厂，则拟暂时缩小范围。为克服浪费、减低成本、提高产品质量和数量，该计划规定各工厂应逐步建立经济核算制度，开展生产节约运动，并具体要求轻工制造业今年减低成本百分之十五到二十，加工制造业减低成本百分之十到十五。
