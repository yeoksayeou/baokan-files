It was also stipulated that each administrative region (equivalent to a province) could select one preparatory committee member. The meeting also decided to publish the "New Sports" monthly, with the main content being the promotion of New Democratic sports and the introduction of sports experiences from the Soviet Union and other New Democratic countries, in order to provide sports workers with professional learning and promote the development of sports activities.
