　　Hungarian People's Republic's first Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary to China, Száfranek György, accompanied by Embassy Counselor Fejtel, Simonyi, and Secretary Florian, presented his credentials to Vice Chairman Liu Shaoqi of the Central People's Government of China at 4:30 PM today. Present at the event were Secretary-General of the Central People's Government Lin Boqu, Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Central People's Government Li Kenong, Acting Chief of General Staff of the Chinese People's Liberation Army Nie Rongzhen, Director of the General Office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Central People's Government Wang Bingnan, Director of the Bureau of Protocol of the Central People's Government Yu Xinqing, and Chief of the Protocol Division of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Wang Zhuoru. Minister Száfranek György delivered a eulogy to Vice Chairman Liu Shaoqi when presenting his credentials, and Vice Chairman Liu Shaoqi delivered a reply.

    Minister Száfranek György's eulogy was as follows:
    Mr. Vice Chairman:

    I feel greatly honored to be appointed as the representative to the People's Republic of China by the Government of the Hungarian People's Republic. As I present my credentials to Your Excellency, I would like to assure you, Mr. Vice Chairman, that I will exert my utmost efforts to strengthen the friendly relations between the People's Republic of China and the Hungarian People's Republic, and to establish closer ties between the two countries.

    The Hungarian people and their government consider the establishment of the People's Republic of China and the enhancement of its international political prestige as a historically significant victory for the cause of peace.

    We have always watched with ardent sympathy and encouragement the great Chinese people's heroic and victorious struggle for liberation against domestic and foreign oppressors, which is nearing completion, and the enormous work it is carrying out in economic recovery.

    I believe that the further development of good relations between the two countries in political, economic, and other fields will not only benefit the people of both countries but will also greatly consolidate the peace camp, headed by the great Soviet Union, which is fighting for world peace and the security of working people around the world.

    As I present my credentials to Your Excellency, I respectfully request that Your Excellency and the authorities of your country assist me so that I may accomplish the mission entrusted to me for the common benefit of the people of both countries.

    Please allow me, Mr. Vice Chairman, to take this opportunity to extend, on behalf of the Hungarian people and the Government of the Hungarian People's Republic, to you and, through you, to the Chinese people, congratulations on your historically significant victory, and to express the hope that our two countries will be inseparably united and move towards the common goal of our people—socialism—through close cooperation in the development of political, economic, and cultural ties between our two countries!
    Vice Chairman Liu Shaoqi's reply was as follows:
    Mr. Minister:

    I am very pleased to accept the credentials presented by Your Excellency, the Minister, on behalf of the Presidium of the Hungarian People's Republic, and I thank Your Excellency for your warm congratulations.

    The friendship between the people of China and Hungary has existed for a long time, and today the governments and peoples of the two countries are working hard towards a common goal. The Chinese people greatly admire the efforts and achievements of the Hungarian people in post-war reconstruction. I believe that the establishment of formal diplomatic relations between China and Hungary will further develop and consolidate the friendship and cooperation between the people of the two countries and will contribute to lasting world peace.

    I warmly welcome Your Excellency to assume the post of the first Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary of the Hungarian People's Republic to the People's Republic of China, and I am willing to provide all kinds of assistance in Your Excellency's work to strengthen cooperation between the two countries.

    I wish your country prosperity and your people prosperity, and I wish your head of state good health.
