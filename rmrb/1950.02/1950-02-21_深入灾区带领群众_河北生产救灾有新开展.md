　　Deepen into Disaster Areas to Lead the Masses
    New Developments in Production and Disaster Relief in Hebei
　  All levels of government in the province have dispatched inspection teams to disaster areas
    [Special Dispatch from Baoding by this Newspaper] Deepening into disaster areas for inspection and leading the masses, Hebei Province achieved new developments in the production and self-salvation movement in January. In early January, the province held an economic conference. At the meeting, the production and disaster relief work of the past few months was reviewed, and the pre-wheat production and self-salvation work was arranged. The provincial government then dispatched 210 cadres in January, organizing ten inspection teams, which went to various special districts and severely affected areas such as Tianjin, Tangshan, and Tongxian. The special commissioner's offices and counties in the disaster areas convened inspection meetings in late December or early January. They respectively transferred hundreds or hundreds of cadres to form work teams to go to the disaster areas, conduct inspections at all levels, and go deep into villages and households. During the inspection at all levels, it was found that some counties and districts were laissez-faire in leading production and self-salvation, paying lip service to disaster relief, avoiding difficulties, and harboring the idea of relying on higher-level relief. For example, in mid-January, some responsible comrades of Tangshan Special Commissioner's Office had not yet studied the State Council's instructions on production and disaster relief. Some cadres in Ji County harbored the harmful idea of canceling disaster relief leadership, believing that "old disaster areas have experience in weathering famines, new disaster areas have surpluses, and water areas can raise fish, so there is no need to manage them much." In Leting, the general opinion among cadres was that to mobilize the masses for production, the government had to provide capital; they did not believe that mobilizing the masses to help themselves could achieve self-salvation. District-level cadres in Cang County Special District generally had the idea of avoiding difficulties and were unwilling to go to severely affected areas. These biases were criticized through meetings and inspections. The direction of facing disaster areas, facing difficulties, and making contributions to the people in disaster relief work was established. That is, leading at each level and going deep down.
    When the inspection team arrived in the village, they deeply publicized production and self-salvation, and investigated household by household. When problems were discovered, they were resolved in a timely manner. According to different situations, diverse production was launched. Discovering that disaster victims lacked funds, the inspection team helped each household plan specifically, turn dead money into living money, convene symposiums, mobilize mutual assistance, or combine with the issuance of production loans, or organize production by the cooperative pre-paying part of the raw materials. For households without production channels, they helped to specifically calculate and find ways and production channels. For households whose products need to be sold, in addition to the cooperatives actively handling supply and marketing, the masses were also mobilized to widely seek sales channels.
　  Investigate household by household, and organize various productions according to different situations.
    The Cang County Special District Party Committee inspection team in Yan Xinzhuang, Huanghua, helped production door to door, and within ten days enabled the whole village to learn the saltpeter boiling technology and be able to produce for self-salvation. The inspection team in Hou Daoyuan, Jianguo County, used the fact that four carts in the village could support families to educate the masses, and helped each car-owning household make plans, so that all 30 carts in the village were active.
    In the in-depth inspection, it was also found that many places did not distribute relief grain in a timely manner. For example, of the 240,000 jin of disaster relief grain allocated to Jinghai County in November and December, only 160,000 jin were distributed to households. Of the 2,000 jin of loan grain allocated to the seventh district of Ninghe at the end of October, it was still in the district in early January. In some places, it was distributed hastily without being combined with the organization of production. Regarding this issue, the inspection team immediately distributed the old and new relief grain and production loans to the masses as production capital based on the masses' self-reporting and public discussion.
　  After the inspection, the confidence of cadres and the masses in production and self-salvation was enhanced, and various productions had new developments.
    After in-depth inspection, cadres at all levels in the province have gained confidence in leading the masses in production and self-salvation. Various productions have also had new developments. In January, weaving, transportation, fish farming, and saltpeter boiling were the most active. According to incomplete statistics, 11,085 looms are active in Cang County, Huanghua, Renqiu, Xian County, and other counties, of which weaving in three counties drives 51,056 spinning wheels. The foreign yarn and cotton needed by Tianjin, Tangshan, Tongxian, and other special districts in January have been temporarily borrowed by the supply and marketing cooperative from the North China Yarn and Cloth Company for 400 pieces of foreign yarn and 550,000 jin of raw cotton. Therefore, weaving has greatly developed in Baodi, Ninghe, Dacheng, Wuqing, Xianghe, and other counties. In Xianghe alone, more than a thousand looms were organized to start work within half a month. In addition to purchasing 300,000 bolts of native cloth and 3.3 million jin of saltpeter on behalf of the provincial supply and marketing cooperative, Tongxian Special District is also actively promoting native cloth to the Northwest. In terms of transportation, in addition to the national economic departments organizing the transportation of grain, coal, peanuts, cloth and cotton, the masses actively engaged in transporting reeds and seafood. According to statistics from five counties in Cang County and Tianjin Special Districts, 6,380 large carts were mobilized. Each large cart earned an average of ten jin of rice, which solved the family's livelihood problem and also supported the livestock. In terms of fish farming, in Ninghe, 7,100 people in 146 villages were engaged in fish farming, producing 30,000 jin of fish every day. In Dacheng, 1,200 people in 48 villages were engaged in fish farming, producing 162,000 jin of fish in 20 days. In terms of sideline occupations such as saltpeter boiling and weaving grass bags, Tianjin and Cang County Special Districts held symposiums on saltpeter boiling and weaving grass bags to exchange experiences. Tianjin County also held a grass bag training class to spread technology and improve quality. Now, 306 of the 366 grass machines have been started. The Ninghe grass bag industry, which originally did not have much, has developed to 128 machines, and another 148 machines are preparing to start work. The proportion of people participating in various sideline productions in January has also increased. In Huanghua County alone, 76,158 people have participated in production, an increase of 5,000 people compared to December.
　  It is necessary to quickly prepare for spring plowing.
    Although Hebei Province has made considerable achievements in production and disaster relief in January, it should make even greater efforts in leading the masses in production and self-salvation. Especially at the current Spring Festival, it is hoped that various state-owned trading departments will not relax their business, continue to handle supply and marketing, so as not to affect production in disaster areas. At the same time, spring plowing is about to begin. In addition to quickly distributing seed loans to households, various localities should start organizing and sorting out labor mutual aid organizations to prepare for spring plowing. Cadres in various localities should also lead the masses to change sideline production according to seasonal changes. In addition, attention should also be paid to the production leadership in lightly affected areas to prevent the spread of the disaster.

　　深入灾区带领群众
    河北生产救灾有新开展
　  全省各级政府均派检查组深入灾区
    【本报保定特讯】深入灾区检查，带领群众，河北一月份生产自救运动获得新的开展。一月上旬，该省召开了经济会议。会上，检查了过去数月的生产救灾工作，布置了麦前生产自救工作。省政府即于一月份先后派出干部二百一十人，组织十个检查组，分赴各专区及天津、唐山、通县等重灾区。灾区的各专署及各县，均于十二月下旬或一月上旬召开了检查会议。分别抽调百余或数百干部，组成工作组到灾区，逐级进行检查，深入到村到户。在逐级检查中，发现有些县区对生产自救领导自流放任，空喊救灾，避难就易，并存在依赖上级救济思想。如在一月中旬，唐山专署有些负责同志，还未研究过政务院生产救灾指示。蓟县一部分干部中存在着“老灾区有渡荒经验，新灾区有节余，水区可以治鱼，不必多管”的取消救灾领导的有害思想。在乐亭，一般干部认为要发动群众生产，只有政府拿出资本；不相信发动群众自己动手可以自救。沧县专区区级干部普遍存在避难就易思想，不愿到重灾区去。经过会议检查、批评了这些偏向。树立了面向灾区，面向困难，在救灾工作中为人民立功的方向。即逐级带领，深入下去。
    检查组到村，一面深入地宣传生产自救，一面挨户调查。发现问题，及时解决。根据不同情况，发动多样生产。发现灾民中缺乏资金，检查组就帮助各户具体打算，把死财变活财，召开座谈会，发动互助，或结合发放生产贷款，或由合作社预支一部分原料组织生产。对没生产门路户，则帮助具体盘算想办法、找生产门路。对产品需要推销户，除由合作社积极办供销，还发动群众广寻销路。
　  挨户调查，根据不同情况，组织各种生产。
    沧县专区地委检查组在黄骅阎辛庄，挨门挨户帮助生产，十天内使全村学会熬硝技术，而能生产自救。检查组在建国县后道院，用该村四辆小车搞运输能养家人的事实，教育群众，并帮助各有车户订计划，使全村三十辆小车都活动起来。
    在深入检查中，还发现许多地方发放救济粮不及时。如十一、十二月份拨给静海县的救灾粮二十四万斤，仅有十六万斤发到户。十月底拨给宁河七区的二千斤贷粮，到一月上旬还存在区里。有的地方，则不结合组织生产，草率发放，对这问题，检查组当即根据群众自报公议，将新旧救济粮、生产贷款，发给群众作生产资本。
　  检查后干部群众生产自救信心增强，各种生产有新开展。
    经过深入检查，该省各级干部对领导群众生产自救都有了信心。各种生产也有了新的发展。一月份，以纺织、运输、治鱼、熬硝最为活动。据不完全统计，沧县、黄骅、任邱、献县等县活动着织布机有一万一千零八十五张，其中三个县织布即带动纺车五万一千五十六辆。而天津、唐山、通县等专区，一月份所缺洋纱、棉花，已由供销社向华北花纱布公司暂借洋纱四百件、皮棉五十五万斤得到解决。因此，在宝坻、宁河、大城、武清、香河等县纺织大有发展。只香河半月内，就组织起千余张织布机动工。通县专区除代替省供销社收购土布三十万匹，皮硝三百三十万斤，并积极向西北推销土布。运输方面，除国家经济部门组织运粮、煤、花生、布棉外，群众积极从事运苇子、运海产。沧县、天津两专区五个县统计就发动起六千三百八十辆大车。每辆大车平均得米十斤，解决了全家生活问题，也养住了牲口。治鱼方面，宁河一百四十六村中，治鱼的有七千一百余人，每天能产鱼三万斤。大城的四十八村中，一千二百余人治鱼，二十天产鱼十六万二千余斤。而在熬硝、织草袋等副业方面，天津、沧县专区各县均召开熬硝与织草袋等座谈会，交流经验。天津县还召开了草袋训练班，传播技术，提高质量。现三百六十六张草机，已动起来三百○六张。本来没有多少的宁河草袋业，已发展到一百二十八张机子，还有一百四十八张机子准备动工。一月份参加各种副业生产的人数比例也提高了。只黄骅县参加生产的已有七万六千一百五十八人，比十二月份增加了五千人。
　  要迅速做好春耕准备工作。
    一月份河北省生产救灾工作虽做出不少成绩。但在生产救灾领导上应更加再接再厉。特别目前正值春节，希望各国营贸易部门不要放松营业，继续办理供销，以免灾区生产受到影响。同时，春耕即要开始，各地除迅速把种子贷发到户，应着手组织与整理劳动互助组织，作好春耕准备工作。各地干部并要根据季节变化，领导群众变化副业生产。此外还要注意轻灾区的生产领导，以免灾情蔓延。
