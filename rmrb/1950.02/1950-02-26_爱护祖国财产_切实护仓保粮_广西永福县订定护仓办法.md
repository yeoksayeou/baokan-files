　　Cherish National Property, Conscientiously Protect Warehouses and Grain
　　Yongfu County, Guangxi Province, Formulates Warehouse Protection Measures
　　[Our Dispatch] According to a report in the Southern Daily on the 12th of this month: In order to promptly prevent losses of public grain, various areas in Guangxi Province have successively made decisions on protecting warehouses and grain, and have convened warehouse protection meetings to meticulously formulate specific measures for the safekeeping of grain warehouses, assigning responsible comrades of the warehouses to conscientiously implement them. For example, the Luojin District of Yongfu County convened a meeting of warehouse owners on the 28th of last month to discuss the issue of assisting in the protection of warehouses and safekeeping of public grain. After detailed discussion by the attendees, specific measures for protecting warehouses and grain were formulated, stipulating that: warehouse owners should actively assist in inspecting for leaky roofs, leaky warehouses, broken walls, and theft. After heavy rain, inspections should be carried out promptly to prevent dampness and mildew. Markings should be made on the outer walls of warehouses to facilitate the prevention of digging walls and stealing grain. Grain storage should be recorded in detail, and each opening of the warehouse should be public, with grain removal requiring government certification, and seals should be applied to the locks, etc. In order to prevent the loss of national property, the County People's Government also emphasized in a notice to the warehouse keepers of each district: warehouse personnel should pay attention to in-depth inspection at all times to ensure that the grain does not suffer the slightest loss.
