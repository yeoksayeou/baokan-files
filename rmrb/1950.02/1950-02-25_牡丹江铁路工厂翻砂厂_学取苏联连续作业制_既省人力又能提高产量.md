[Northeast News] The Mudanjiang Railway Factory Foundry in Songjiang Province, learned from Soviet technical experience, changed its labor organization and working methods, increasing the number of furnace openings per month from eight to thirteen, and overcoming the chaos within the factory. The factory has thirty foundry workers. The old practice was to make sand molds for two days and then open the furnace on the third day, spending a whole day specifically pouring molten iron. The factory was small, and pouring molten iron was particularly chaotic. Because there was only one overhead crane, everyone competed to use it, which delayed work a lot. Only eight furnaces could be opened per month, and completing the task of sixty tons a month required rushing. In September of last year, after accepting the advice of Soviet experts, and in accordance with the existing conditions of the factory, the workers were divided into two shifts to implement a continuous operation system, opening the furnace once every other day. Eight of the thirty workers were assigned to the night shift to specifically pour molten iron on the night of the furnace opening, and they would make sand molds when the furnace wasn't being opened. The twenty-two workers in the day shift specialized in making sand molds. Secondly, the eight workers in the melting furnace were also divided into labor: two workers in the day shift transported coke, iron, and crushed white stone; the six workers in the night shift poured molten iron, and repaired the furnace when not pouring iron. An additional worker was added to the night shift to specifically operate the overhead crane. After this division of labor, five more furnaces were opened each month than before, saving fourteen workers per furnace, saving one hundred and eighty-two workers per month, and increasing production by twenty percent compared to the past.

　　牡丹江铁路工厂翻砂厂
    学取苏联连续作业制  既省人力又能提高产量
    【东北讯】松江省牡丹江市铁路工厂翻砂分厂，学取苏联技术经验，改变了劳动组织和工作方法，每月开炉由八次增加到十三次，克服了厂内忙乱的现象。该厂有翻砂工三十名，过去的老例是先做二天砂型，第三天开炉，用一整天专门倒铁水。厂子狭小，倒铁水时特别乱糟。因只有一台天车，大家争着抢着使用，很耽误工作。每月只能开八次炉，一个月完成六十吨任务就得紧忙。去年九月时，接受苏联专家的意见，按照工厂现有条件，把工友分成两班，实行连续作业制，隔一天开炉一次。在三十名工友中抽出八名作夜班，在开炉的晚上专门倒铁水，不开炉就作砂型。白天班二十二名工友专做砂型。其次，把熔解炉八名工友也分了工，白班两个人运焦炭，运铁和砸白石；夜班六个人倒铁水，不倒铁水时就修炉。夜班并另添一工友，专管开天车。这样分工后，每个月比前多开五次炉，每炉节省十四个工，一个月可节省一百八十二个工，产量比过去提高百分之二十。
