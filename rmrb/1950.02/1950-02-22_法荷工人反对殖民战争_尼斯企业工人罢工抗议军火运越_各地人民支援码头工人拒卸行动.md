Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, February 21st: The working people of France and the Netherlands are persisting in their opposition to imperialist colonial wars. According to a TASS report: On the 14th of this month, tram workers, railway workers, and workers from several enterprises in the southern French city of Nice held a strike to protest the shipment of war materials to Vietnam. The strikers broke through police lines and angrily threw military equipment ready for loading into the sea. Following the workers in Nice, dockworkers and construction workers in Saint-Nazaire also refused to transport arms. The Paris Regional Federation of Trade Unions and the working people of Gennevilliers, near Paris, donated several truckloads of clothing and food to support the dockworkers in Cherbourg who refused to unload American war materials.

In the Netherlands, the Dockworkers' Committee held a meeting in Amsterdam attended by four thousand people, guaranteeing not to unload American war materials. Efforts to support the workers refusing to unload arms are also underway. Workers at the Crommeni (north of Amsterdam) steel plant donated a portion of their wages to a fund to aid the dockworkers. Working people in many other parts of the Netherlands also held rallies and demonstrations to support the dockworkers' refusal to unload.
