Under the wise leadership of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks) and Stalin, the Soviet people, advancing by leaps and bounds, have fully demonstrated the Moscow character, the Soviet character, the Bolshevik character in completing the post-war five-year plan, as they did in the Patriotic War: whatever they are determined to do for the interests of the people, they will find a way to complete it no matter what the difficulties; they will sacrifice everything for the interests of the people; and more importantly, they have the courage to admit their mistakes and correct them.

In the course of making great strides forward, there are not no problems or contradictions. The conflict between the machine factory (Director Podapov) and the textile factory (Director Sevilova) written by A. Safronov in the play "Moscow Character" should be a typical example. Through such an event with a comedic ending, the struggle between the new and the old in socialist Soviet Union unfolds on the stage, thus showing the positive effect of criticism and self-criticism. Criticism and self-criticism is the sharpest weapon of a Bolshevik, which guarantees that the new will surely defeat the old, and accelerates the advance of the progressive socialist Soviet Union.

Podapov is basically an excellent Soviet worker. He has the ability to make his factory complete and exceed the plan. His mistake lies in the fact that he neglected that the completion and exceeding of the plan is primarily the victory of the policy of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks), but completely regarded it as the credit of himself and a small number of assistants, and thus became proud, short-sighted, and only caring about himself. This development is dangerous, as his wife Griniva pointed out: he has lost his sense of freshness and will degenerate a good Communist Party member. His opponents, including Sevilova, Griniva, District Committee Secretary Polozova, Supreme Soviet Representative Kluchkova, textile factory foreman Griniv, machine factory party secretary Druzhinin, etc., are correct. They see farther than him and stand completely and truly on the position of the Party, the state, and the people to see problems, speak and make decisions. There is no need to doubt that in this struggle, the set of ideas and styles represented by Podapov will inevitably be defeated.

However, in the Soviet Union, where Marxism-Leninism is the guiding principle for action, a person who has unfortunately made a mistake in his work can correct his mistake. Podapov not only accepted the decision of the District Committee and accepted the order for new machines from the textile factory, but finally, in front of his comrades and in front of his wife, he further admitted his mistakes and recognized the glorious character of his wife who was selfless and fought him on principle.

The comedy closed happily. We will remember the people with the Moscow character - the Bolshevik character - who have the courage to admit their mistakes. At the same time, we will further realize the importance of criticism and self-criticism as a sharp weapon. The True News editorial said: "The Party uses the seasoned weapon of criticism and self-criticism to oppose the remnants of capitalism in people's consciousness, and directs the firepower of public opinion to all old habits that hinder our progress. The cutting edge of Bolshevik criticism and self-criticism is aimed at the shortcomings in the work of the Party and Soviet organs, and especially at the phenomenon of forgetting the Party's political work and taking a bureaucratic attitude towards the cultural life needs of the working people."

　　略谈“莫斯科性格”
    在新与旧斗争中的批评与自我批评的作用
    刘念渠
    在联共（布）党与斯大林的英明领导下，大步向前行进的苏联人民，在完成战后五年计划中，和在卫国战争中一样，每一个人都充分的表现了莫斯科性格、苏联人性格、布尔什维克性格：为了人民利益决心去做的事，不管有什么困难，一定要设法完成；为了人民利益不惜一切牺牲；而更重要的是，有勇气承认自己的错误并改正错误。
    在大步向前行进中，并不是没有任何问题或矛盾的。如Ａ·沙佛罗诺夫在“莫斯科性格”一剧中所写的机器制造厂（厂长波达波夫）和纺织工厂（厂长塞维洛娃）之间的冲突，应该是一个典型的例子。通过这样一个有着喜剧的结尾的事件，在舞台上展开着社会主义苏联的新与旧的斗争，从而显示了批评与自我批评的积极效用。批评与自我批评乃是一种布尔什维克的最锐利的武器，它保证着新的必定战胜旧的，把进步着的社会主义苏联加速的向前推进了。
    波达波夫，在基本上，是个苏维埃的优秀的工作人员。他有能力使他所管理的工厂完成并超过计划。他的错误在于他忽略了完成并超过计划首先是联共（布）党的政策的胜利，却把它完全当成自己和一小部分助手们的功劳，因而变得骄傲、短视、只顾自己。这样发展下去是危险的，如他的妻葛利尼娃所指出的那样：他失去了对于新鲜事物的感觉，将使一个好的共产党员堕落了。他的反对者们，包括塞维洛娃、葛利尼娃、区委书记波洛左娃、最高苏维埃代表克鲁支可娃、纺织厂领班葛利尼夫、机器制造厂党委书记德鲁支宁等等，则是对的。他们比他看得远，完全而真正的站在党的、国家的、人民的立场上去看问题、发言和做决定。一点用不着疑惑，在这一斗争中，波达波夫所代表的那一套思想与作风，必然是要被击败的。
    但是，在苏联，在马列主义作为行动指针的地方，一个在工作中不幸犯了错误的人，是可以改正自己的错误的。波达波夫不仅接受了区委会的决议，接受了纺织厂新机器的订货，终于，在自己的同志面前，在自己的妻子面前，更进一步地承认了自己的错误，认识了大公无私的和自己作原则性的斗争的妻子的光荣的性格。
    喜剧愉快的闭幕了。我们会记忆着具有这种承认错误的勇气的莫斯科性格——布尔什维克性格的人们。同时，我们也会进一步的认识到批评与自我批评这一锐利的武器的重要性。真理报社论曾说：“党以批评与自我批评的老练的武器，反对人们意识中的资本主义的残渣，并把舆论的火力指向阻碍我们前进的一切旧习气。布尔什维克批评与自我批评的刀锋，是针对着党与苏维埃机关的工作中的缺点的，并且首先是针对着忘记党的政治工作和对待劳动人民的文化生活的需求采取官僚主义态度的现象。”
