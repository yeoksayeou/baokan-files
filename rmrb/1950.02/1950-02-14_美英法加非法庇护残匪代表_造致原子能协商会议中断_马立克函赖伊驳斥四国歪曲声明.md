Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 13th: TASS, New York, 11th: Soviet Union's Permanent Representative to the United Nations, Malik, sent a letter to United Nations Secretary-General Lie, stating:

    Your Excellency, Secretary-General: In view of the statement issued by the representatives of the United States, the United Kingdom, France, and Canada to the United Nations Atomic Energy Commission, and distributed by Your Excellency, which incorrectly narrates the actual proceedings of the 14th meeting of the United Nations Atomic Energy Commission's Permanent Member States Consultation Meeting held on January 19th of this year, and thus fails to state the true situation at the time, the Soviet delegation believes it must declare that the statement by the representatives of the United States, the United Kingdom, France, and Canada, which states that important and solemn consultations on atomic energy issues were "interrupted due to the position held by the Soviet representative," is untrue and distorts the Soviet delegation's position on these issues. As can be seen from the full text of the statement made by the Soviet representative at the Atomic Energy Commission's Permanent Member States Consultation Meeting on January 19, 1950, which is attached to this letter, the fact of the matter is this: The Soviet representative supports the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China's demand to expel the representatives of the Kuomintang clique from the various agencies of the United Nations, because, as declared by the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China, the representatives of the Kuomintang clique neither represent China nor the Chinese people. The Soviet representative, based on this suggestion, believes that the representatives of the Kuomintang clique in the United Nations Atomic Energy Commission's Permanent Member States Consultation Meeting are not qualified to represent China and should be expelled. The Soviet representative also announced at the same time that if the representatives of the Kuomintang clique participate in it, the Soviet representative will not participate in the aforementioned consultation.

    The United States, Britain, France, and Canada rejected the Soviet representative's proposal. Therefore, the Soviet representative had to leave the consultation meeting and made an appropriate statement at the same time.

    Thus, the breakdown of the Atomic Energy Commission's Permanent Member States Consultation is not, as the representatives of the United States, Britain, France, and Canada have tried to distort in their statement (they say it is the result of the position taken by the Soviet representative), but is due to the position taken by the representatives of the above four countries, because they refuse to expel the representatives of the Kuomintang clique from the organization of the consultation meeting discussing atomic energy issues. Relying on the support of the representatives of the governments of the United States, Britain, France, and Canada, that Kuomintang clique attempts to continue to illegally attend the aforementioned consultation meeting, disregarding the repeated formal statements and demands of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China.

    Attached to this letter are two statements made by the Soviet representative at the United Nations Atomic Energy Commission's Permanent Member States Consultation Meeting on January 19, 1950.

　　美英法加非法庇护残匪代表
    造致原子能协商会议中断
    马立克函赖伊驳斥四国歪曲声明
    【新华社北京十三日电】塔斯社纽约十一日讯：苏联驻联合国常任代表马立克致函联合国秘书长赖伊称：
    秘书长先生阁下：鉴于美国、英国、法国和加拿大驻联合国原子能委员会代表发表的并经阁下分发的声明，不正确地叙述了本年一月十九日举行的联合国原子能委员会常任会员国协商会议第十四次会议的实际开会情形，因而未能述明当时的真实情况，所以，苏联代表团认为必须声明：美国、英国、法国和加拿大代表的声明中所称关于原子能问题的重要的和郑重的协商“因苏联代表所持立场而告中断”一节是不确实的，而且是曲解了苏联代表团对这些问题的立场。从随同此函附上的苏联代表在一九五○年一月十九日原子能委员会常任会员国协商会议上发表的声明全文中可以看出，问题事实上是这样的：苏联代表支持中华人民共和国中央人民政府关于把国民党集团的代表开除出联合国各机构的要求，因为正如中华人民共和国中央人民政府所宣布的一样，国民党集团的代表既不代表中国，也不代表中国人民。苏联代表依此建议，认为联合国原子能委员会常任会员国协商会议中的国民党集团的代表，没有代表中国的资格，应予逐退，苏联代表并于同时宣布，如国民党集团的代表参加其中，则苏联代表将不参加前述的协商。
    美、英、法和加拿大否决了苏联代表的这一建议，因此，苏联代表不得不离开协商会议，并于同时作出适当的声明。
    这样，原子能委员会常任会员国协商的破裂，并不是如美、英、法、加四国的代表们在他们的声明中所尽力歪曲的（他们说是由于苏联代表所采取的立场的结果），而是由于上述四国的代表们所采取的立场，因为他们拒绝把国民党集团的代表开除出讨论原子能问题的协商会议的组织，而那个国民党集团的代表依靠着美、英、法、加四国政府的代表们的支持，不顾中华人民共和国中央人民政府的历次的正式声明与要求，企图继续不合法地出席上述的协商会议。
    与这封信一起，尚附有苏联代表于一九五○年一月十九日在联合国原子能委员会常任会员六国代表协商会议上所作的两次声明。
