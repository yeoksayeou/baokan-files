　　Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 8th: TASS reports: Nominations for candidates to the Supreme Soviet of the USSR are continuing enthusiastically throughout the Soviet Union. Stalin has become the unanimous candidate of the entire Soviet people. The preliminary election conferences in various regions fully demonstrate the infinite love and loyalty to the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the great leader and teacher Stalin, and unanimously propose Stalin's close comrades-in-arms, the leaders of the Soviet government and the Communist Party of the Soviet Union: Molotov, Malenkov, Beria, Voroshilov, Kaganovich, Mikoyan, Andreyev, Khrushchev, Bulganin, Shvernik, Kosygin, Suslov, etc., as candidates.
    Pravda devoted three pages on the 6th to publishing the preliminary election conferences in Moscow, Yerevan, Baku, Gorky, Kishinev, Stalingrad, Sverdlovsk, Alma-Ata, and other cities, as well as the nominations of Stalin at the conferences. The proposal by the personnel of the Moscow Electrical Equipment Factory to nominate Stalin as a candidate has been warmly supported by the workers' congress of all enterprises in the Stalin constituency of Moscow. Petrova, a Stakhanovite female worker at the Moscow Machine Tool Factory, said: "After the war, the Soviet people faced major difficulties. But we have healed the wounds of war. No one will ever be able to conquer us, because Stalin is with us." Her moving words were drowned out by a storm of cheers.
