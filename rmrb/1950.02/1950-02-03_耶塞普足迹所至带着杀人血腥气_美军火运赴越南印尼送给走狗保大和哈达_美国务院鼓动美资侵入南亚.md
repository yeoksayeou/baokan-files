Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, February 2nd: U.S. weapons are being shipped to Vietnam and Indonesia following the footsteps of U.S. roving ambassador Jessup. According to a Washington dispatch from the Electric News Agency on January 31st: Several U.S. ships have already departed from U.S. bases in Okinawa, Guam, and the Philippines, loaded with U.S.-made weapons bound for Vietnam and Indonesia, to be delivered to the Bảo Đại and Hatta groups. These weapons come from U.S. military warehouses at these bases. This batch of weapons was proposed by MacArthur and approved by the U.S. government as part of the military aid plan before the U.S. Chiefs of Staff, led by Bradley, departed for Tokyo earlier this week. To date, MacArthur has already transported $60 million worth of weapons from Japan alone to Vietnam and Indonesia. To repair and assemble weapons at Okinawa, Guam, the Philippines, and other U.S. Pacific bases, MacArthur's staff will utilize former Japanese arsenals.

Providing military aid to Bảo Đại and Hatta was the subject of lengthy discussions during Jessup's stopover in Saigon and Singapore last weekend and his current stay in Jakarta. Although the details of Jessup's discussions have not been disclosed, Jessup has published Acheson's letter to Bảo Đại, which can only be described as a promise of U.S. intervention in the Republic of Vietnam.

Throughout January, Jessup toured the countries of the Far East and Southeast Asia to seek a "new" U.S. policy toward the region, which is now manifested in arming puppet groups against their own people. The powerful rise of the national liberation movement in Asia, inspired by the victory of the Chinese people, has forced U.S. imperialism to arm all possible allies in the Pacific as quickly as possible.

Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, February 2nd: TASS, New York, February 1st: U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for Near Eastern, South Asian, and African Affairs, McGhee, recently delivered a speech at a luncheon held for entrepreneurs interested in extracting profits from Asian countries, urging U.S. capitalists to increase investment in South Asia, especially in India and Pakistan. But he declared that India and Pakistan must provide an appropriate "atmosphere" to attract these investments.

McGhee explicitly pointed out that the United States intends to use negotiations aimed at concluding "friendly" and commercial treaties to achieve the modification of certain laws and regulations in India and Pakistan. Because these laws and regulations limit the efforts of U.S. imperialists to extract unlimited amounts of super-profits in these regions.

　　耶塞普足迹所至带着杀人血腥气
    美军火运赴越南印尼送给走狗保大和哈达
    美国务院鼓动美资侵入南亚
    【新华社北京二日电】美国武器正随着美国巡回大使耶塞普的足迹之后，运往越南与印尼。据电通社华盛顿一月三十一日讯：美国轮船数艘，业已驶离美国在冲绳、关岛及菲律宾的基地，装载着美制武器开赴越南和印尼，送给保大和哈达集团。这些武器系来自美国在这些基地上的军事仓库。这批武器是麦克阿瑟提出的，是在以布莱德雷为首的美国各参谋长本周初动身赴东京前为美国政府所批准的军事援助计划的一部分。截至现在，麦克阿瑟仅自日本就已输送了价值六千万美元的武器至越南和印尼。为了在冲绳、关岛、菲律宾及其他美国太平洋基地修理和装配武器，麦克阿瑟参谋部将利用以前的日本兵工厂。
    对保大和哈达予以军事援助，乃是耶塞普上周末逗留西贡和新加坡与他现在逗留在雅加达期间所进行的冗长讨论的主题。虽然耶塞普讨论的详细内容未予透露，但耶塞普已把艾奇逊给保大的信发表，这封信只能称为是美国干涉越南共和国的诺言。
    在一月份当中，耶塞普巡游了远东和东南亚各国，以寻求一个美国对该地区的“新的”政策，这个政策现在已表现在武装傀儡集团反对其自己的人民上。为中国人民的胜利所鼓舞的亚洲民族解放运动的有力高涨，已迫使美帝国主义者要尽可能迅速地武装太平洋的一切可能的盟国。
    【新华社北京二日电】塔斯社纽约一日讯：美国国务院负责近东、南亚与非洲事务的助理国务卿麦克希，顷在对亚洲国家榨取利润发生兴趣的企业家们所举行的午餐会上，发表演说，敦促美国资本家增加在南亚，尤其是在印度和巴基斯坦的投资。但他宣称：印度和巴基斯坦必须提供吸引这些投资的适当“气氛”。
    麦克希明确地指出：美国企图利用旨在订立“友好”和商业条约的谈判，来获致印度和巴基斯坦某些法律和条例的修改。因为这些法律和条例，对美帝国主义者设法在这些地区榨取无限的制额利润的努力，是有限的。
