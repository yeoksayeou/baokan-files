　　Recommendation of "Boundless Radiance"

    "Boundless Radiance" is a feature film recently produced by the Northeast Film Studio. It is adapted from the true story of Liu Yingyuan, a labor hero and representative of the People's Political Consultative Conference from the Northeast.
    This film not only portrays the great achievements of production and construction in an era led by the working class, but also depicts new typical figures of this new era. The character in the film, Zhou Mingying, is a concentrated representation of these heroic figures emerging from the working class. This type of people's hero is emerging in large numbers on production and struggle posts across the country.
    The great creativity and initiative of the working class can only flourish under the leadership of its own political party. The author portrays the high degree of selflessness and sense of responsibility of the working class through characters such as Zhou Mingying and Old Sun. Under the leadership of the Communist Party, the workers have raised their class consciousness and combined their lives with the cause of the class, the Party, the revolution, and production and construction. The success or failure of restoring power generation is related to the entire class and the cause of the Party, and also to Zhou Mingying personally. Based on this ideological awareness, the entire staff, led by Zhou Mingying, with the attitude of masters of the house that "the factory has become our own home," pooled their wisdom and efforts and worked hard to finally clear the obstacles on the road ahead, exposed the sabotage of special agents, overcame the lack of resources and technical difficulties, and completed the glorious task of restoring electricity and supporting the war.
    This film also handles the coordination and cooperation between intellectual and manual labor in the new society relatively well. For example, it is reflected in the Party cadre and factory director's emphasis on technical personnel, and the transformation of Section Chief Zhao and Master Fang from lacking confidence in the creativity of the workers to advancing side by side with the workers and contributing their own strength. Generally, the workers who have seen this film reflect that this film has a good grasp of the principle of solidarity among employees.
    Zhang Ping, the actor who plays Zhou Mingying, has created a labor hero image with a prominent personality and rich emotions. The lifelike nature of some factory operation scenes and the psychological depiction of feeling derelict in his duty after the generator was burned down by special agents all show that the actor has put in a lot of effort for this role. Other characters such as Old Sun and Section Chief Zhao are all portrayed appropriately.
    It should be affirmed that this film is basically successful. However, it also has minor flaws, such as the expression of the ideological development of the masses from backwardness to progress in the process of repairing the power plant is not layered enough and in line with scientific laws; and some languages ​​and actions are not very life-like, etc.

　　推荐《光芒万丈》

    《光芒万丈》是东北电影制片厂最近出品的一部故事片。它是取材于人民政协代表东北工人劳动英雄刘英源同志的真实事绩而加以改编制成的。
    这部影片不仅表现了工人阶级领导的时代中生产建设的伟业，而且表现了这新时代中的新的典型人物。片中这个人物——周明英，就是集中地代表了这一些从工人群中涌现出来的英雄人物。这类的人民英雄正在全国各生产斗争岗位上大量的涌现出来。
    工人阶级的伟大创造性和积极性只有在工人阶级自己的政党领导之下，才能得到蓬勃的发展，作者通过了周明英及老孙等人物刻划了工人阶级的高度的忘我精神和工作的责任感。工人们在共产党领导下提高了阶级觉悟，把自己的生命跟阶级，党，革命与生产建设事业结合起来。恢复发电的成败利钝，是整个阶级和党的事业的干系，也就是周明英个人的干系。在这样思想觉悟的基础上，以周明英为首的全体员工，以“工厂成了咱们自己的家”的主人翁姿态，群策群力，努力工作，终于扫清了前进道路上的障碍，揭发了特务的破坏，克服了资材缺乏及技术上的困难，完成了恢复电力、支援战争的光荣任务。
    这部片子更比较完满的处理了在新社会里智力劳动与体力劳动得到协调合作的情景。譬如表现在党的干部厂长对技术人员的重视，与赵股长方师傅从对工人的创造性没有信心到与工人群众齐头并进献出自己的力量等处，使一般看过这部片子的工友均反映这一部片子在职工团结的这一原则掌握得好。
    饰演周明英的演员张平创造了一个性格突出感情丰富的劳动英雄形象。如某些工厂作业镜头的生活化及发电机被特务焚毁后，自己感到失职内疚的心理描写，都说明演员对于这个角色下了工夫。其他如老孙头、赵股长等角色都作到了恰如其分的表现。
    应当肯定，这部影片基本上是成功的。但它也存在着微疵，如在修复发电厂的过程中，表现群众从落后到进步的思想发展，不够层次分明，合乎科学的规律；以及有些语言动作不够十分生活化等。
