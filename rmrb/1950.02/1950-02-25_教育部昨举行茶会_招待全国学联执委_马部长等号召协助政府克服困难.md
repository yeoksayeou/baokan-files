Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, February 24th: The Ministry of Education of the Central People's Government held a tea party at 1:00 PM today in the ministry's auditorium to host student representatives from various regions attending the Enlarged Meeting of the 14th Executive Committee of the All-China Students' Federation. Over a hundred people attended, including executive members of the All-China Students' Federation and student work leaders from various regions. Minister Ma Xulun, Vice Ministers Qian Junrui and Wei Que, and responsible comrades from various departments, divisions, and sections of the ministry were present. Minister Ma delivered a welcoming speech, extending a warm welcome to the student representatives from various regions. Finally, he expressed his hopes to the representatives, saying: "The complete liberation of the country has not yet been fully achieved. Taiwan, Hainan Island, Tibet, and other places are still awaiting liberation. The government's finances are currently very difficult, so I hope that the students can take on the task of propaganda, responding to the grain delivery campaign, and promoting the purchase of inflation-adjusted Victory Bonds, to assist the government in doing a good job of production, disaster relief, and rescuing education in disaster areas."

Representatives from various regions spoke in succession. Many regional representatives raised issues such as heavy course loads that should be reduced, lack of teachers, financial difficulties in schools, and students dropping out of school. They also put forward many good suggestions to the Ministry of Education.

Following this, speeches were given by Xie Bangding, Chairman of the All-China Students' Federation, Vice Minister Wei, and Vice Minister Qian. In his speech, Vice Minister Qian pointed out that our schools should open their doors to workers and peasants. In the future, education should be closely integrated with production, and scientific and technical education should be strengthened at all levels of schools. In order to overcome the financial difficulties brought about by the current victory, he called on everyone to learn to live frugally and to overcome difficulties with a fighting spirit. The tea party concluded at 6:00 PM.
