　　Beijing's First Workers' Congress, Day Four
	Peng Zhen Calls for Building a People's Capital
　　[Beijing News] The fourth day of Beijing's First Workers' Congress (5th) was dedicated in the morning to reports by representatives from each group on the results of their discussions of "Summaries of the Past Year's Union Work and This Year's Work Tasks." In the afternoon, Peng Zhen, Secretary of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, addressed the congress. The congress is scheduled to discuss the proposals put forward by the preparatory committee of the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions today (6th), and to hold elections to establish the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, after which it will conclude.

　　Comrade Peng Zhen, Secretary of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, delivered a speech yesterday to a warm welcome from all the representatives. Comrade Peng Zhen first analyzed the current international and domestic situation, pointing out that the imperialist camp is aging and declining like the setting sun, their domestic economic crisis is becoming increasingly serious, production is declining, and workers are unemployed; conversely, the countries of the peaceful and democratic camp led by the Soviet Union are growing and strengthening like the rising sun, production has been rapidly restored and developed. Taking the Soviet Union as an example, last year's industrial productivity has increased to 41 percent compared with before the war, and the lives of workers and people in socialist countries and various people's democratic countries are gradually improving. Imperialism, in its death throes, desperately wants to fight, but they are afraid of being beaten and know that they will be unlucky if they start a war. Therefore, their conspiracy is bound to fail. Domestically, we have already achieved a basic victory, and the remaining enemies will soon be completely eliminated. We are confident of achieving complete victory and consolidating victory. There are still many difficulties facing us, but these are difficulties in the midst of victory and development, and we have the confidence to overcome them. The responsibility for overcoming these difficulties falls first and foremost on the shoulders of our workers. We workers must work hard to restore and develop production, so that the country can heal the wounds of war as soon as possible, and the construction cause can develop rapidly. Comrade Peng Zhen went on to talk about the central tasks of Beijing this year, first being the restoration and development of production, followed by the development of cultural education, municipal construction, and the continued suppression of reactionary remnants. Regarding the issue of production, Comrade Peng Zhen pointed out that state-owned enterprises must formulate production plans, improve the planning of production, implement democratic management effectively, conclude collective contracts, implement strict cost accounting, and carry out production competitions. This year, the government will strengthen its leadership and support for private industry. In private factories, it is also prepared to carry out production competitions conditionally. Regarding the tasks of the trade union work, he pointed out that it is necessary to strive to lead all workers to restore and develop production, to launch movements to increase output, improve quality, and reduce costs; to run workers' welfare undertakings well, to improve workers' culture and technology, to strengthen internationalist education, and to lead workers to actively participate in political activities, and to build a people's capital.

　　When representatives from each group reported on the results of their group discussions, they unanimously supported the report of Xiao Ming, Director of the Preparatory Committee of the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, and expressed that they would mobilize workers in various factories to overcome all difficulties and complete production tasks. The representatives used concrete facts to prove some of the experiences and lessons presented in the report, and also put forward supplementary opinions on the achievements and shortcomings of the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions Preparatory Committee over the past year, as well as the democratization of factory management and the conclusion of collective contracts.

　　In the afternoon, the congress invited Wang Chun, Director of the Beijing Municipal Supply and Marketing Cooperative, to report on the situation of the cooperative; Zu Tiangong, Deputy Minister of the Propaganda and Education Department of the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions Preparatory Committee, reported on the income and expenditure of cultural and educational funds; Liu Laifu, Secretary-General of the Congress, explained the draft constitution of the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions. During the meeting, the Cultural and Educational Workers' Union presented a banner to the congress to pay their respects. The presidium read out joint congratulatory messages from the Beijing Working Committee of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League, the Preparatory Committee of the Beijing Democratic Youth Federation, and the Beijing Student Federation, the congratulatory message from the Preparatory Committee of the Beijing Federation of Industry and Commerce, and the congratulatory message from all the staff and workers of the Fengtai Horseshoe Factory Trade Union. The Xinhua Bookstore Beijing Branch also donated 550 books to the representatives of the congress.

　　At the meeting, forty representatives jointly made a temporary motion, which was unanimously adopted by the congress, to save 941 jin of millet from the day's dinner expenses to support the worker brothers persecuted by the British government in Hong Kong.

　　In the evening, representatives held group discussions on Comrade Peng Zhen's speech and the draft constitution of the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions.
