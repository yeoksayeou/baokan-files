Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 11th: According to a dispatch from the Telecommunications Agency: Romania has formulated its first budget in history without a deficit. It is estimated that expenditures for the 1950 fiscal year will be 3 billion lei less than revenues (150 lei equals one US dollar). Expenses for state organs have been reduced to only one-third of what they were during the capitalist rule. This year's expenditure on workers' holidays will be ten times more than last year. Capital investment will reach 120 million lei, education 30 million lei, and health 14 million lei. Four-fifths of the total revenue will come from the socialist state-owned sector of the national economy (68.5 percent of the total revenue comes entirely from socialist accumulation), and 10.1 percent will come from income tax.
    
Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 11th: According to a dispatch from the Telecommunications Agency: The Bulgarian 1950 national budget was submitted to the National Assembly on the 8th by Bulgarian Finance Minister Lazarov. The largest part of the budget will be used to develop industry, with defense expenditures accounting for only 7 percent. Lazarov pointed out that in capitalist countries, the part of the budget used for armed forces and police often reaches 50 percent or more, and the national income falls into the hands of capitalists. However, the entire national income of people's democratic countries is entirely beneficial to the working people.
    
The total budget is one-third higher than last year, nearly 50 billion leva (287.36 leva equals one US dollar). Thirty-five percent of the budget is used to develop the national economy, 30 percent for social and cultural purposes, government expenditures account for 13 percent, and subsidies and other social welfare expenses account for 8 percent.
    
TASS, Warsaw: Polish Minister of Education Skrzeszewski pointed out during a speech to the Parliamentary Government Budget Committee on the 3rd regarding the 1950 government budget: Education expenses account for 23.6 percent of the entire budget, an increase of 43 percent over last year's education expenses. This is the best proof of Poland's peaceful policy.
    
Skrzeszewski said: According to the National Economic Six-Year Plan, teacher training colleges will have approximately 40,000 teachers graduate. In addition, 6,000 teachers will study at national teacher training classes. The network of welfare institutions for children who have not yet reached school age will be greatly expanded. Student allowance appropriations will increase by about 2 billion zlotys (400 zlotys equals one US dollar). Madujewski, who is responsible for eliminating illiteracy, reported at the meeting that 3.5 billion zlotys will be allocated to eliminate illiteracy in 1950, three times the amount of last year.

　　罗保波三国制定今年预算
    最大部分用作经济和文化建设
    【新华社北京十一日电】据电通社消息：罗马尼亚历史上第一次制定了没有赤字的预算。据估计，一九五○年度的支出方面将较收入方面少三十亿列伊（一百五十列伊合美金一元）。国家机关经费已减低到仅及资本主义统治时期的三分之一。今年用在工人假日上的支出，将较去年增多十倍。资产投资方面将达一亿二千万列伊，教育方面三千万列伊，卫生方面一千四百万列伊。总收入的五分之四将出自国民经济中的社会主义的国营部分（总收入的百分之六八·五完全来自社会主义的积累），百分之十·一将出自所得税。
    【新华社北京十一日电】据电通社消息：保加利亚一九五零年度国家预算，已由保财政部长拉查罗夫于八日提交国民议会，预算中的最大部分将用于发展工业，国防费仅占百分之七。拉查罗夫指出资本主义国家的预算中用于武装部队和警察的部分，常达百分之五十或者更多，国民收入落在资本家的手中。而人民民主国家的全部国民收入，则是完全有利于劳动人民的。
    预算总额较去年增加三分之一，即将近五百亿利瓦（二八七·三六利瓦合美金一元）。预算的百分之三十五用于发展国民经济，百分之三十用于社会与文化目的，政府支出占百分之十三，扶助金及其他社会福利费占百分之八。
    【新华社北京十一日电】塔斯社华沙讯：波兰教育部长斯克列杰夫斯基三日在议会的一九五○年政府预算委员会讲演时指出：全部预算中教育费占百分之二十三点六，比去年的教育费增加了百分之四十三。这是波兰和平政策最好的证明。
    斯克列杰夫斯基称：依照国民经济六年计划，师范学院将有约四万名教师毕业。另外，将有六千名教师到国立教师训练班学习。为未及学龄儿童而设的福利机关网将大大扩充。学生津贴拨款将增加二十亿兹罗提左右（四百兹罗提合美金一元）。负责消灭文盲工作的马杜杰夫斯基在会上报告称：一九五○年将为消灭文盲工作拨款三十五亿兹罗提，款额为去年的三倍。
