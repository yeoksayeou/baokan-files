The East China Military and Political Committee is a representative organ of the Central People's Government's State Council for leading local government work. It will represent the 130 million people of East China, exercise the functions and powers of the East China People's Government, and uniformly lead the work of the People's Governments of Shandong, Jiangsu, Anhui, Zhejiang, Fujian, and Taiwan provinces.

The following attended the conference: Rao Shushi, Chairman of the East China Military and Political Committee; Vice Chairmen Zeng Shan, Su Yu, and Ma Yinchu; Secretary-General Wu Kejian; and committee members Ding Chaowu, Wang Yunsheng, Bao Dasan, Zhu Zifan, Zhu Junxin, Yu Yanong, Shen Zixiu, Shen Zhiyuan, Song Shilun, Li Shiying, Li Mingyang, Leng Yu, He Sui, He Xiehou, Wu Youxun, Wu Yaozong, Wu Yunxu, Jin Zhonghua, Miao Hainan, Hu Ming, Hu Juewen, Tang Liang, Xia Yan, Guo Zihua, Guo Huaruo, Xu Shiyou, Chen Yisheng, Chen Shiqu, Chen Pixian, Chen Wangdao, Chen Shaokuan, Chen Yi, Sheng Pihua, Zhang Yun, Zhang Kexia, Zhang Dingcheng, Zhang Qi, Shu Tong, Zeng Xisheng, Fu Qiutao, Feng Xuefeng, Guan Wenwei, Li Yu, Liu Shaowen, Liu Minsheng, Liu Changsheng, Liu Xiao, Liu Hongsheng, Pan Hannian, Deng Yuzhi, Kui Yanfang, Xiao Wangdong, Xie Renbing, Xie Xuehong, Dai Ji, Long Yao, Tan Zhenlin, and a total of sixty-two people.

Chairman Rao Shushi delivered the opening speech. He first pointed out that the East China Military and Political Committee includes representatives from various provinces and regions of East China, various democratic parties, various revolutionary classes, the People's Liberation Army, overseas Chinese, and other patriotic democratic人士. This shows that the East China Military and Political Committee is a local democratic united government of the great unity of the people of East China. Chairman Rao then pointed out that because Taiwan and the coastal islands have yet to be liberated, land reform has not yet been implemented in the newly liberated areas of East China, and East China suffered severe natural disasters last year, the tasks facing the people of East China are very arduous. However, we firmly believe that under the correct leadership of Chairman Mao, the Central People's Government, and the Chinese Communist Party, and relying on the great unity and unyielding efforts of all the soldiers and civilians of East China, we will definitely overcome any difficulties and complete the glorious tasks of liberating Taiwan and building a new East China.

Chen Yi, representative of the East China Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, delivered a speech, calling on the Communist Party members and the people of East China to unanimously support the East China Military and Political Committee, and to strive to implement the resolutions of the East China Military and Political Committee and build a new East China.

Vice Chairman Ma Yinchu said in his speech: We must quickly build the East China region, which is at the forefront of national defense, into a strong peace fortress, and transform the many old cities in East China that used to serve imperialist bureaucratic capitalism and rely on the imperialist economy for survival and deformed development into new cities that serve the people and are truly sound and prosperous.

Subsequently, committee members Liu Minsheng from Shandong, Leng Yu from Jiangsu, Shen Zixiu from Anhui, He Xiehou from Zhejiang, Chen Shaokuan from Fujian, Xie Xuehong from Taiwan, Chen Shiqu from Nanjing, and Sheng Pihua from Shanghai delivered speeches. They unanimously expressed their warm congratulations on the establishment of the East China Military and Political Committee and expressed their willingness to work under the leadership of the East China Military and Political Committee and Chairman Rao to liberate Taiwan and build a new East China. Committee member Xie Xuehong said powerfully: Taiwan must be liberated, and the people of Taiwan must be completely liberated. Taiwan is the territory of our People's Republic of China, and we will never allow Chinese and foreign reactionaries to continue to have a foothold there. She called on the people of Taiwan to step up mobilization, resolutely launch struggles against the Kuomintang and Chiang Kai-shek reactionaries in all aspects, and fight to the end for the liberation of the people of Taiwan.

Next, Chen Jianchen, representative of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, Su Yanbin, representative of the China Democratic League, Yu Huancheng, representative of the Democratic National Construction Association, Cao Hongzhu, representative of the China Association for Promoting Democracy, and Shen Baowen, representative of the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party, delivered speeches successively, unanimously believing that the East China Military and Political Committee is a symbol of the great revolutionary unity of the people of East China and a symbol of the further development of various tasks in East China.

Shanghai worker representative Ma Xiaodi, farmer representative Zhang Yaoxiang, youth representative Zhang Ben, women's representative Fang Lingru, cultural and educational representative Zhou Yutong, industrial representative Rong Yiren, and East China People's Liberation Army representative Liu Kuiji spoke in succession. They all excitedly expressed that they would stand at their respective posts, step up production, work hard, smash the enemy's blockade, overcome various difficulties, and support the establishment of the East China Military and Political Committee with practical actions. Liu Kuiji said: We are willing to continue to advance under the leadership of the Central People's Government and the East China Military and Political Committee, strengthen training, eliminate the remaining enemies, and fight to the end to liberate Taiwan, liberate all of East China, liberate all of China, and consolidate the national defense of New China!
