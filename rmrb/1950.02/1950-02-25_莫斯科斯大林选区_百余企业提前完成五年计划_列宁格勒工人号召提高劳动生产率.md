　　Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 24th: According to a comprehensive TASS dispatch: In Moscow's Stalin electoral district and throughout Leningrad, working people in all factories and plants have launched a production competition to celebrate the election of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, achieving new production successes every day.

　　In the Stalin electoral district of Moscow, employees of the Moscow Light Bulb Factory won first prize on February 11th in the socialist competition among enterprises under the Ministry of Postal and Telegraphic Supplies Industry. The factory had won the Red Banner of Victory from the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union for two consecutive years. It has now guaranteed to complete the Five-Year Plan by March 12th (election day), transforming itself into a Stakhanovite enterprise. In recent months, thirty-eight work teams at the factory have been awarded the title of "High-Quality Work Teams." Twelve workshops in the factory are now collectively engaged in Stakhanovite labor. This means that every worker there completes and exceeds the new progressive production quotas. The fitter Maslov, who first nominated Stalin as a candidate for deputy to the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union at the factory's election meeting, completes 250 percent of his quota every day, while his work team completes 220 percent.

　　In other enterprises in the Stalin electoral district, hundreds of workers have also exceeded their production quotas. At the "Komicha" Heavy Machine Tool Manufacturing Plant, 118 Stakhanovite workers have already completed their Five-Year Plan. Individual workshops, work teams, and individual workers have participated in the competition to celebrate the election of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union. Seven hundred young workers at the Izmailovo factory have begun Stakhanovite work. One hundred and thirty-six enterprises in this district have already completed the post-war Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule.

　　The slogan of workers in all factories and plants in Leningrad is: complete three months of the plan ahead of schedule and further increase labor productivity. The city's Tool Manufacturing Plant reached the goals of the Five-Year Plan in four years and twenty days. The plant's employees have ranked among the top in the competition among enterprises under the Ministry of Machine Tool Industry of the Soviet Union. The "Proletarian" factory, which produces high-voltage porcelain, has achieved remarkable success in the competition celebrating election day. The "Red Triangle" factory overproduced tens of thousands of pairs of first-class quality shoes in early February. Kulikov, a model maker at the Electrical Tool Manufacturing Plant, has designed and produced a lightweight machine that can perform six woodworking operations simultaneously, reducing the time required for producing casting models by two-thirds.

    【新华社北京二十四日电】综合塔斯社消息：莫斯科斯大林选区和列宁格勒全城的劳动人民，在一切制造厂与工厂中，展开了庆祝苏联最高苏维埃选举的生产竞赛，并且每天都带来新的生产成就。
    在莫斯科的斯大林选区中，莫斯科电灯泡工厂的员工于二月十一日在邮电用品工业部所属各企业的社会主义竞赛中获得一等奖。该工厂曾连续两年荣获苏联部长会议的优胜红旗。现在，该厂已保证到三月十二日（选举日）完成五年计划，变成斯塔哈诺夫式工作的企业。近数月来，该厂有三十八个工作组已荣获“优等质量工作组”的称号。该厂有十二个工作间现在是集体的斯塔哈诺夫式劳动的工作间。这意味着那里每一个工人都完成并超计划完成新的累进的生产定额。在该厂选举会上第一个提名斯大林为苏联最高苏维埃代表候选人的装配工人马斯洛夫，每天完成定额百分之二百五十，而他的工作组，则完成百分之二百二十。
    在斯大林选区的其他企业中，也有数以百计的工人超过了他们的生产定额。在“科米查”重机器工具制造厂，有一百十八位斯塔哈诺夫式工人业已完成了他们的五年计划。个别工作间、工作组和个别工人，业已参加了庆祝苏联最高苏维埃选举的竞赛。伊兹迈洛伏工厂的七百名青年职工，已开始斯塔哈诺夫式工作。这个区已有一百三十六个企业提前完成了战后五年计划。
    列宁格勒一切制造厂和工厂工人的口号是：提前完成三个月的计划，进一步提高劳动生产率。该城的工具制造厂已在四年零二十日内达到了五年计划的目标。该工厂的员工们已在苏联机器工具工业部所属各企业的竞赛中名列前茅。生产高压瓷器的“无产者”工厂，在庆祝选举日的竞赛中，获得了卓越的成就。“红色三角”工厂在二月上旬超计划生产了数万双头等质量的鞋子。电气工具制造厂的模型制造者库利科夫已设计并生产了一种轻便机器，这种机器能同时进行六种木工作业，并使生产铸造模型的时间，减少了三分之二。
