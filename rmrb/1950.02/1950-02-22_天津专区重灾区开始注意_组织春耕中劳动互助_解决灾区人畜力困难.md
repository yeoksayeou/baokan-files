　　[Report from Tianjin Prefecture] According to an investigation in Tianjin Prefecture, Hebei Province, the serious disaster areas lack labor and livestock. It is necessary to emphasize the organization of labor mutual aid in preparation for spring plowing. In the first, second, third, and fourth districts of Ninghe County and the seventh, eighth, and ninth districts of Baodi County, there are 357 villages with 1,086,520 mu of cultivated land. As of now, 94 villages have not been able to drain the water, and 258,145 mu of land cannot be cultivated. Of the 828,375 mu of cultivated land that has been drained, 29,385 mu were planted with autumn wheat last year. The remaining 798,990 mu can be planted with 247,732 mu of spring wheat and 551,258 mu of field crops. However, due to the severity of the disaster and some disaster victims fleeing, the labor force has been greatly reduced. The number of livestock has also been reduced from 11,827 to 3,588 due to sales, slaughter, and deaths. Under these circumstances, if we do not effectively emphasize the combination of sideline production and agricultural production, and organize labor mutual aid, many villages will be unable to carry out spring plowing and sowing on half of their cultivated land. Therefore, the prefecture is currently paying attention to the issue of organizing labor mutual aid, calling on and organizing the masses to plant more spring wheat and early-maturing crops, with each household planting two fen of spring vegetables and one to one and a half mu of spring wheat. It is also crucial to preserve livestock and prevent further reductions.

　　天津专区重灾区开始注意
    组织春耕中劳动互助  解决灾区人畜力困难
    【本报天津专区讯】据河北省天津专区调查，重灾区劳力、畜力缺乏，准备春耕中必须强调组织劳动互助。重灾区宁河县的一、二、三、四区与宝坻县七、八、九区七个区，共有三五七个村庄，耕地一○八六五二○亩。至现在看，有九四村水不能脱落，有二五八一四五亩地不能耕种。已脱出水的耕地八二八三七五亩，去年已种秋麦二九三八五亩，其余七九八九九○亩，可种春麦二四七七三二亩，种大田五五一二五八亩。但由灾情严重，灾民有些逃荒的，使劳动力大减。而牲畜原有一一八二七头，卖、杀、死亡现还剩三五八八头。在这种情况下，如不很好强调进行副业生产与农业生产结合，组织劳动互助，会有不少村庄，有一半耕地无法进行春耕播种。因此目前该专区提起注意组织劳动互助问题。号召与组织群众多种春麦与早熟作物，每户要种二分春菜，一亩到一亩半春麦。并坚决保存牲畜不再减少。
