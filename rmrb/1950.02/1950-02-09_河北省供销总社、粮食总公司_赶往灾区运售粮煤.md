The Hebei Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative and the Grain Corporation, responding to the provincial government's call to rescue disaster victims, are actively transporting and selling grain and coal to the disaster areas. To take care of the purchasing power of the disaster victims, the Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative is lending coal to the disaster victims daily at prices lower than the listed prices of the Coal and Iron Company, supplying them with fuel; with coal to burn, the disaster victims can save some of their grain stalks to feed their livestock. The disaster victims in Ninghe County, a severely affected area, are severely lacking in grain and spring wheat seeds. The Hebei Grain Corporation purchased a large amount of bran, sorghum, and rice bran from Tianjin on the 29th of last month and supplied it to the disaster victims for food through the Tianjin Special Zone Cooperative. It also exchanged autumn wheat for 200,000 jin of spring wheat from the grain depot, ready to lend it to the disaster victims quickly to solve the problem of seeds this spring. The Cangxian Special Zone Food Grain Branch Company and the Special Zone Cooperative have decided to lend the 31 million jin of wheat seeds in stock to the disaster victims interest-free through the cooperative for use as seeds, to be returned after the wheat harvest.

    赶往灾区运售粮煤
    【本报讯】河北省供销总社及粮食总公司，响应省府抢救灾民号召，积极往灾区运售粮煤。该省供销总社，为照顾灾民购买力，每天以低于煤铁公司牌价价格贷煤，供应灾民燃料；灾民有了煤炭烧用，可以省出一部分谷草喂牲口。重灾区宁河县灾民的粮食和春麦种籽均甚缺乏，河北粮食总公司，于上月二十九日从天津收买大批麸皮、高粱、米糠，通过天津专区合作社，供给灾民食用。并用秋麦向粮库换取二十万斤春麦，准备迅速贷予灾民，解决今春种籽问题。沧县专区食粮分公司及专区合作社，已决定将所存三千一百万斤麦种，通过合作社无息贷给灾民作种子，待麦收后归还。
