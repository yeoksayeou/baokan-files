　　A Major Contribution of Northeast Industry
    Fushun Gasoline of Excellent Quality
    Tianjin Transportation Company to Adopt it in Large Quantities
    [This Newspaper's Report] The Kuangxing brand gasoline produced by the Fushun Mining Bureau in Northeast China is of high quality and low price, and has been widely used in Northeast China. In order to further supply the needs of North China, the Bureau shipped a batch to Tianjin in December last year for trial use by the Tianjin Transportation Company. After preliminary inspection, the specific gravity of the oil is 0.75, the gum content is 27MG100CC, and the volatility is normal. After a month of long-distance testing of various types of vehicles, the general standard of 11 kilometers per gallon for a three-ton truck can be achieved. Compared with American oil, Fushun oil has higher viscosity and more smoke, but the performance is the same, and the price is more than 30% lower than American oil. Tianjin Transportation Company has now purchased it in large quantities from Fushun Mining Bureau.

　　东北工业一大贡献
    抚顺汽油品质优良
    津运输公司将大量采用
    【本报讯】东北抚顺矿务局所产矿星牌汽油，质高价廉，已在东北普遍采用。该局为进一步供应华北需要，于去年十二月间运津一批，首先供给天津运输公司试用。经初步检验，油质比重为○．七五，所含胶质为２７ＭＧ１００ＣＣ，挥发力正常。经一个月来各型车长途试验结果，一般都能达到每加仑行驶三吨车十一公里的标准。如与美国油比较，抚顺油粘性比较大，烟比较多，可是效能是一样的，而价格则低于美油百分之三十以上。天津运输公司现已向抚顺矿务局大量购用。
