Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, January 31st: The Beijing Public Security Bureau achieved significant results in 1949 in eliminating secret agents and maintaining public security, delivering a devastating blow to covert agent organizations and establishing and consolidating the revolutionary order of the capital. Before liberation, the Kuomintang bandit gangs had eight major secret agent systems in Beijing, including the Bureau of Investigation and Statistics (also known as Military Intelligence Bureau), the Second Department of the Ministry of National Defense, and the Central Bureau of Investigation and Statistics (also known as Central Statistics Bureau), with numerous secret agents. After liberation, many secret agents from the Bandit Constitution Military 19th Regiment and the Criminal Police Team disguised themselves and remained hidden in the city to continue their evil deeds, greatly affecting social order. Over the past year, the Municipal Public Security Bureau has adhered to the policy of combining leniency with suppression, resolutely implemented the proclamation of the Municipal Military Control Commission ordering secret agents and reactionary party and league members above the district level to register. A total of 3,170 reactionary party and league members and 3,251 secret agents have registered. A small number of secret agents who were incorrigible, continued to engage in counter-revolutionary activities, and refused to register were resolutely suppressed. In the past year, a total of 165 major secret agent cases have been cracked, including eight cases of military conspiracy and riots involving Zhang Yinwu and Wu Leiyuan, 92 cases of lurking involving Xu Zongyao, nine cases of secret agent murder, six cases of secret agent robbery, ten cases of economic sabotage, five cases of secret agent impersonation, ten cases of forging road passes and documents, and 25 other cases. 407 radio stations, 1,559 guns, and 15,016 documents were seized.

In terms of public security, due to the large number of scattered soldiers, vagrants, and secret agents lurking in the city in the early days of liberation, colluding with habitual bandits, engaging in robbery, sabotage, theft, buying and selling gold and silver, and even murdering our staff; at the same time, a large number of scattered soldiers, vagrants, exiled landlords, and family members of puppet personnel turned to small business for a living, resulting in a sharp increase in street vendors, affecting social order and traffic safety. Professional thieves also took the opportunity to engage in large-scale activities, creating temporary chaos. Based on the above situation, the Municipal Public Security Bureau first concentrated its efforts on accommodating scattered soldiers, punishing bandits, reorganizing street vendors, banning the buying and selling of gold and silver, arresting thieves, and accommodating beggars. A total of 21,078 scattered soldiers were accommodated, 309 robbery cases were cracked with 594 criminals, 2,070 cases of disrupting financial order were cracked with 3,774 criminals, 2,880 theft cases were cracked with 2,654 criminals, 1,248 beggars were accommodated, and 2,102 thieves were arrested and sent to the court for sentencing and forced to engage in productive labor and transformation. More than 43,000 street vendors were moved to 13 street vendor markets. In the process of accommodating scattered soldiers and cracking robbery cases, 4,848 long and short guns were seized. After this stage of effort, the chaotic phenomenon was basically eliminated. After the urban order was generally stabilized, the Municipal Public Security Bureau strengthened the administrative management of public security, reorganized the police administration, improved business, established a new household registration system, reformed the household registration declaration method, trained 526 traffic police in batches, formulated traffic regulations and interim regulations for automobile management, registered and approved 4,232 drivers and 205 car dealers. On November 21st, in order to implement the resolution of the Municipal People's Representative Conference, the Municipal Public Security Bureau sealed up 224 brothels, concentrated 424 bosses and pimps, liberated 1,268 prostitutes, and concentrated them for education and transformation. In total, 18,557 cases of illegal acts, 2,479 criminal cases, 92 fires, and 339,142 tons of garbage were handled throughout the year.

　　首都革命秩序巩固
    京公安局一年治安工作
    摧毁特务组织  改造游民生产
    【新华社北京三十一日电】北京市公安局一九四九年间在肃清特务和治安工作方面都有重大成绩，予特务潜伏组织以摧毁性打击，建立并巩固了首都革命秩序。解放前，国民党匪帮在北京的特务组织，计有保密局（即军统）、国防部二厅、党通局（即中统）等八大系统，特务分子很多。解放以后，匪宪兵十九团和刑警队特务多化装潜伏市内继续作恶，影响社会秩序甚大。一年来，市公安局掌握宽大与镇压相结合的方针，坚决执行了市军管会限令特务分子和区级以上反动党团分子登记的布告，先后共登记了反动党团分子三千一百七十名，特务三千二百五十一名。对少数怙恶不悛、继续进行反革命活动、而拒不登记的特务分子，则坚决予以镇压。一年来共破获重大特务案件一百六十五起，计有张荫梧、吴雷远等军事阴谋暴动案八起，徐宗峣等潜伏案九十二起，特务杀人案九起，特务行抢案六起，破坏经济案十起，特务冒充案五起，伪造路条证件案十起和其他案件二十五起，缴获电台四百零七部，枪一千五百五十九枝，证件一万五千零十六件。
    治安工作方面，解放初期由于大批散兵游勇及特务潜伏市内，与惯匪勾结，从事抢劫、破坏、偷窃、买卖金银，甚至杀害我工作人员；同时又因大量散兵游勇、流亡地主和伪人员家属转入小商谋生，因此摊贩剧增，影响社会秩序和交通安全，职业小偷也乘机大肆活动，造成了一时的混乱现象。市公安局根据以上情形，首先集中力量进行收容散兵、惩处盗匪、整理摊贩、取缔金银买卖、抓捕小偷、收容乞丐等工作。前后计收容散兵两万一千零七十八人，破获抢劫案三百零九件、人犯五百九十四人，破获扰乱金融案二千零七十件、人犯三千七百七十四人，破获盗窃案两千八百八十件、人犯两千六百五十四人，收容乞丐一千二百四十八人，抓捕小偷两千一百零两人送法院判刑并强迫其生产改造。对于四万三千余户摊贩则分别移至十三个摊贩市场。在收容散兵及破获抢劫案中，并收缴长短枪四千八百四十八枝。经过这一阶段的努力，基本上消灭了混乱现象。在城市秩序大体安定后，市公安局即进行加强治安行政管理工作，整理警政，提高业务，建立新的户籍制度，改革了户口申报办法，分期集训交通警五百二十六名，制订了交通规则和汽车管理暂行规则，登记核准驾驶员四千二百三十二名、车行二百零五家。十一月二十一日，市公安局为推行市各界代表会议的决议，查封妓院两百二十四家，集中老板、领家四百二十四人，解放妓女一千二百六十八名，并集中进行教育改造。总计全年共处理违警事件一万八千五百五十七件，刑事案件两千四百七十九件，扑灭火灾九十二起，清除垃圾三十三万九千一百四十二吨。
