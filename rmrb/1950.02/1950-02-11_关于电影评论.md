　　On Film Reviews
    Fudovichenko
    It is a pity that we often do not fully and effectively utilize our political and literary strength to better and more clearly convey the ideological and artistic truths contained in Soviet films to the audience.

    In order for reviews to be skillful and beneficial, the author must, in addition to the film itself, also have a good knowledge of the relevant knowledge and other materials related to the film's production.

    One must be good at correctly expressing the film's ideological content, evaluating each artistic expression and its correctness, and giving objective evaluations to the work of all creative personnel, directors, artists, and composers.

    It is not permissible to write a review after only cursorily watching the film once. Comrade Stalin said in a conversation with Comrade Voroshilov: "I always think that a good film needs to be watched several times. It is difficult to thoroughly understand everything the director intends and hopes to explain on the screen in just one viewing."

    This instruction demonstrates the great significance Comrade Stalin gives to film art and his respect for film activists. Our critics and editors should remember Comrade Stalin's words when writing and publishing film reviews.

    What kind of value can such film evaluations give to readers?

    The difference between our newspaper's film reviews and theater reviews is that their authors often have less understanding of specific film issues. Therefore, they are often bound by repetitive storytelling of film content, and only give the most general evaluation at the end. In this way, these reviews are more like reporting on the film than analyzing it.

    For example, there is a film review about "Secluded Life." In this review, the content of the film is described in great detail, and in the conclusion it says: "There are still many shortcomings in the first Estonian film. The actors participating in the film production for the first time feel constrained, but the film leaves a great impression. The acting skills of Raoul, an actor of the Estonian Soviet Republic, and the young actress Rateas, who plays the professor's daughter, are unforgettable. Film director Rappoport was able to correctly resolve a series of dramatically interesting and intense scenes, and fully and correctly embodied the thoughts of the drama and theatrical creators." ("Voroshilov Truth")

    From these sentences, it is impossible to form a concept of the film's advantages, nor is it possible to form a concept of the film's disadvantages.

    In another review of the same film, after the narrative of the content, it is said: "The film is filled with deep, true optimism and confidence in our Soviet reality. The film "Secluded Life" is an undoubted creative success of the actors, stage supervisors, and directors" ("Grodnensky Truth"). Readers are not clear where the success lies. Because the critic declared the success, but did not specify and confirm this success.

    You may also encounter film reviews of this kind, in which there is not even a sentence of commentary or analysis of the work of the creative staff: from beginning to end, one shot follows another, and the film is continuously and repeatedly narrated.

    Film reviews must occupy a lasting and regular position in the publications of the republic, province, and district. Every film shown on the screen needs to be reviewed for this purpose: that is, first of all, to convey the film's ideological and political content and educational significance to the broadest masses. In the allied republics, film reviews must also specifically point out the growth and development of national film art and fully assist in the education of film cadres of all nationalities.

    Reviews of documentary films must be closely aligned with the tasks of the republic, province, and border regions. This is in order to use the promotion of certain experiences of the economic and cultural growth of other provinces and republics to inspire the best completion of these tasks.

    Our film reviews are the most advanced in the world. It must have the most thoughtful and skilled film criticism.

　　关于电影评论
    伏多维琴科
    很遗憾，我们常常不会充分有效地运用我们政治文学的力量，以便更好地、更清楚地把苏维埃影片所包括的那些思想和艺术真理传达给观众。
    为了使评论成为熟练和有益处的，作者必须除了影片本身之外，还得很好地知道为该影片制作有关的知识及其他材料。
    必须善于正确地表达出影片的思想内容，评价每个艺术表现力和正确性，对所有创作人员、导演、美术家、作曲家的工作，均应给与客观的评价。
    如果只马虎潦草地看了一次影片之后就写评论，是不许可的。斯大林同志与伏罗希洛夫同志的谈话中，曾说过：“我总是想，好的影片，需要看好几次，仅仅是一回很难彻底了解导演打算和希望在银幕上说明的一切”。
    这一指示证明斯大林同志对电影艺术所给与的巨大意义，和他对电影活动家们的尊重。我们的批评家和编辑工作人员，应当在写作和发表电影评论的时候，记住斯大林同志的这些话。
    像这样的电影评价能给读者些什么呢？
    我们报上关于影片的评论，和戏剧评论所不同的地方，就是它们的作者往往较少地懂得关于电影的专门问题。因此，他们常常为电影内容的重复讲述所束缚，而在最后才给与最一般的评价。这样一来，这些评论与其说是在分析影片，倒不如说是在报道影片了。
    例如有一篇关于《隐居生活》的影评。在这评论中极详细地述说了影片的内容，而在结论中说：“在第一部爱沙尼亚影片中尚有不少缺点，感觉到首次参加电影摄制的演员受拘束，但在电影却遗留下极大的印象。爱沙尼亚苏维埃共和国人民演员拉乌尔，扮演教授女儿的年青女演员拉特阿斯二人的演技，令人永记不忘。电影导演拉普鲍尔特能够正确地解决了一系列戏剧上有兴趣的激烈场面，并且完全正确地体现了戏曲和戏剧创作者的思想。”（《伏罗希洛夫真理报》）
    从这些语句中，既不可能构成关于影片优点的概念，也不可能构成关于缺点的概念。
    在关于同一影片的另一评论中，则在内容的叙述之后，说道：“影片为深深的，真正的乐观主义，为对我们苏维埃现实性的信心所充满。影片《隐居生活》——是演员、舞台监督、导演的勿庸怀疑的创作成功”（《格罗德宁斯基真理报》）。成功究竟在什么地方，读者们是不清楚的。因为关于成功，评论家是声明了，但却没指明和证实这一成功。
    也会遇到这类影评，其中连一个评论和分析创作人员工作的字句也没有：从头到尾是一个镜头跟着一个镜头，对影片接连不断地重复叙述。
    电影评论必须在共和国的、省的和区的刊物上，占有持久和经常的地位。每个在银幕上上映的影片，均需要以这样目的来予以评论：即首先要求把影片的思想政治内容和教育意义传达与最广大的群众。在盟员共和国中，电影评论必须也同时详细地指明本民族电影艺术的成长和发展，以及全力协助对各民族电影干部的教育。
    关于文献记录影片的评论，必须紧密地与其本共和国、省、边疆的任务相调和。这样以便利用其他省及共和国经济和文化成长的一定经验的宣传，以鼓舞最好地来完成这些任务。
    我们的电影评论，是世界上最先进的。它必须具有最有思想性、最熟练的电影批评。
