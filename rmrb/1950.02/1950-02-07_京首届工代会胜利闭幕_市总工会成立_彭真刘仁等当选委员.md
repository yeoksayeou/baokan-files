　　Beijing's First Workers' Congress Successfully Concludes
    Municipal Federation of Trade Unions Established
    Peng Zhen, Liu Ren, and Others Elected as Committee Members
    [Beijing News] Beijing's First Workers' Congress, lasting five days, successfully concluded yesterday (6th). The meeting adopted the Constitution of the Beijing Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, elected members of the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, and formally established the Beijing Municipal Federation of Trade Unions.

    Comrade Xiao Ming's two reports, "Summary of Trade Union Work in the Past Year" and "Tasks of Trade Union Work in the Future," were discussed by the delegates in groups. They not only expressed their firm support but also put forward supplementary opinions. After summarizing these opinions, he made a concluding speech at the meeting, believing that most of the opinions were worth noting by the new Municipal Federation of Trade Unions Committee. For example, the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions Preparatory Committee's work in the past focused more on deployment than inspection, lacked clear instructions and specific assistance, and did not effectively grasp the method of making breakthroughs at one point, gaining experience, and promoting it comprehensively. Representative meetings should be held frequently to exchange opinions and experiences, etc. After Xiao Ming's speech, the congress discussed and adopted the "Beijing Municipality's Regulations on Signing Collective Contracts in Public Factories" proposed by the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions Preparatory Committee, "Guaranteeing the Conscientious Implementation of the 'Resolution on the Issue of Relieving Unemployed Workers' of the Second Beijing People's Representative Conference of All Circles," and twenty-two other proposals. It also unanimously passed a congratulatory telegram to Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu. Then, Xu Liqun, Secretary of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Youth League, spoke, pointing out that the relationship between the Communist Youth League and the working class in factories is extremely close. It is an advanced youth organization led by the vanguard of the working class—the Communist Party, and it is an assistant to the Communist Party and the administration. It plays a leading and exemplary role among young workers. He hoped that all parties would provide more help to the Communist Youth League so that it could play an active role for young workers in restoring and developing production. Li Bo Zhao, of the Cultural Work Committee of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, spoke, explaining that in the year since the liberation of Beijing, the working class has not only made achievements in production and construction but also in cultural work. In the past year, young literary and art workers have gone to factories to cooperate with workers on one hundred and five works. These works have promoted production and reflected the workers' active efforts in production. She pointed out that the culture of the working class should be further improved so that workers' literature and art can be further developed. Various forms of literature and art should be used to commend production models, increases in output, improvements in quality, and reductions in costs, and to criticize shortcomings in production, so that the task of developing production can be smoothly completed.

　　京首届工代会胜利闭幕
    市总工会成立
    彭真刘仁等当选委员
    【北京讯】京市首届工人代表大会，历时五天，昨（六）日胜利闭幕。会议通过了北京市总工会会章，选出市总工会委员，正式成立北京市总工会。
    萧明同志的“一年来工会工作总结”及“今后工会工作的任务”两报告，经大会代表分组讨论除一致表示坚决拥护外，并提出补充意见，经归纳后他又在会上作总结发言，认为大部分意见是值得新的市总工会委员会记取的，如市总工会筹委会工作过去是布置多，检查少，缺乏明确指示具体帮助，没有很好掌握突破一点取得经验推广全面的工作方法，为交换意见和经验应常常召开代表会议等。萧明讲话后，大会讨论并通过了市总工会筹委会所提“北京市关于公营工厂签订集体合同”、“保证切实执行北京市第二届各界人民代表会议‘关于救济失业员工问题的决议’”和其他二十二件提案，并一致通过向毛主席、朱总司令致敬电。接着青年团北京市工作委员会书记许立群发言，他指出：工厂中的青年团与工人阶级的关系极为密切，它是工人阶级先锋队——共产党领导的先进青年组织，是共产党与行政的助手，它在青年工人当中起带头与模范作用，希望各方面要多帮助青年团，使它能在恢复与发展生产中发挥青年工人的积极作用。中共北京市委会文艺工作委员会李伯钊讲话说明北京解放一年来，工人阶级不但在生产建设上是有成绩的，就是在文艺工作方面也有很大成绩。一年来青年文艺工作者到工厂中去与工人合作了一百零五个作品。这些作品对生产起了推动作用，并且反映了工人在生产中积极的努力。她指出工人阶级的文化应进一步提高，工人文艺才能得到进一步的发展。要通过各种文艺形式，表扬生产模范以及产量的增加，质量的提高，和成本的减低，批评生产中的缺点，使发展生产的任务顺利地完成。
