　　Investigation and Research Work on Local Operas
　　——A Letter to Mr. Cheng Yanqiu
　　Zhou Yang
　　Mr. Yanqiu:

　　I was very pleased to read your letter and your work, "A Brief Account of a Visit to Northwest Operas."

　　During your trip to the Northwest, you discovered a wealth of materials on local Northwest operas and are planning to conduct further, more systematic and detailed investigations. You also intend to go to Qinghai and Xinjiang to study the dramas, music, and dances of various ethnic groups. I fully support your plan and wish you success. The treasures of folk art in the Northwest are indeed very rich. During our time in northern Shaanxi, we did some collecting, organizing, and research. The now-popular New Yangko and Waist Drum Dance are the results of that period. Comrade Ma Jianling has also achieved significant success in applying the form of Qin腔 (Qinqiang Opera). We have made preliminary modifications to the folk art materials we have mastered, using new perspectives and methods. However, this modification work is clearly insufficient. On a national scale, this is even more true. We have not yet universally, systematically, and deeply investigated the diverse traditional art forms that still live among the people in various localities, nor have we fully utilized and transformed them. In the minds of some literary and art workers, there is still a tendency to not value or even to look down upon the artistic forms of their own national traditions. Now it must be affirmed that the Chinese people, as the sole legitimate inheritors of the entire artistic heritage accumulated by the Chinese nation over thousands of years, will treat and handle these heritages with a very serious attitude. We must patiently and carefully excavate them, collect them together, and then examine them one by one. According to Chairman Mao's instructions, we must "discard the dross and select the essence," so that all the excellent elements in our national traditional art can be preserved and continue to develop, allowing the new people's literature and art to connect with the people's traditional literature and art. This connection is very important and necessary. Without this connection, the new literature and art will not easily take root among the broad masses of the people, and thus it will be difficult to completely replace and surpass the old literature and art. This is a huge historical task placed before each of our literary and art workers.

　　Collecting, organizing, and researching various local operas and music has already had a significant impact on the reform of old operas and the creation of new operas, and I believe it will have an even more significant and decisive impact in the future. It is completely wrong for some friends in the Peking Opera circle to look down on local operas. Your emphasis on local operas is even more worthy of everyone's learning. You criticized the trend of blindly worshiping the West and neglecting the historical heritage of our nation, and these opinions are very correct. However, you believe that incorporating direct realism into old operas has led the reform of old operas down the wrong path. This point seems to warrant further consideration. I don't know if the direct realism you refer to is the technique of spoken drama? While the reform of old operas does need to appropriately consider the many characteristics and advantages inherent in Chinese national opera, and not destroy them too easily, it cannot completely refuse to adopt what you call direct realism techniques. The truly touching parts of old operas often lie in their realism. Therefore, we should not refuse to learn from brother arts such as spoken drama and film. We do not blindly worship the West, but we must learn from and draw on the world's classical dramatic heritage, especially the achievements of Soviet drama. On this point, we cannot have a closed-door attitude. Our national new opera is still in a creative and formative process. We encourage various reform attempts, even if some of these attempts are inevitably rough, immature, or fail in the initial stage. However, through mutual discussion and criticism within the drama community and the identification and selection of the broad masses, I believe that our national opera will be richer and more improved, and better able to shoulder historical tasks. What do you say?

　　Returning to the topic, you asked if it is necessary to expand the scope of the investigation of local operas in various places. I think it is necessary. To the extent that the government can do, the cultural and educational authorities of each province and city, and the cultural work troupes, must have specialized institutions or personnel responsible for this investigation work. Hebei and Shanxi provinces have already started doing this, and other places should also do so. In addition to written records, it is best to use a recorder to record the lyrics and tunes. The survey materials should be copied multiple times to avoid loss. We are currently planning to organize folk literature and art research groups in order to carry out the collection work extensively and on a large scale. Have you drafted your specific investigation plan? I would very much like to know, and I am willing to do my best to help you.

　　In reply, with respects,

　　Zhou Yang

　　关于地方戏曲的调查研究工作
　　——致程砚秋先生的一封信
　　周扬
　　砚秋先生：
    很高兴地读了您的来信和大作“西北戏曲访问小记”。
    您这次到西北，发现了西北地方戏剧的丰富材料，预备更进一步作有计划的详细的调查，并有意思到青海、新疆去研究各民族的戏剧乐舞。我十分赞成您的这个计划，并预祝您的成功。西北民间艺术的宝藏确是很丰富的。我们在陕北的时期，曾经做了一些搜集、整理、研究的工作，现在流行的新秧歌与腰鼓就是那一时期工作的成果。马健翎同志在运用秦腔形式上也获得了显著的成效。我们将已掌握的民间艺术材料用新的观点和方法进行了初步的改造。但这个改造的工作显然是十分不够的。就全国范围来说，更是如此。对于尚活在各地方人民中的多种多样的民族传统的艺术形式，我们还未有普遍地、系统地、深入地加以调查研究，并充分地利用和改造它们。在若干文艺工作者的思想中，至今还存在有对自己民族传统的艺术形式重视不够甚至轻视的倾向。现在必须肯定，中国人民，作为中华民族数千年来所累积的全部艺术遗产之唯一合法的继承者，将以十分认真的态度来对待和处理这些遗产。我们要耐心地、仔细地将它们发掘出来，收集拢来，然后一一加以检验，照毛主席所指示的，“去其糟粕，取其精华”，使我们民族传统艺术中的一切优良成分得以保留并继续发展，让新的人民的文艺和人民传统的文艺衔接起来。这个衔接是非常重要的和必要的。没有这个衔接，新的文艺就不容易在广大人民中生根，因而也就困难完全代替与胜过旧文艺。这是摆在我们每个文艺工作者面前的一个巨大的历史性的任务。
    搜集、整理与研究各种地方戏剧、音乐，对旧剧的改革与新歌剧的创造上，已经发生了重大的作用，而且，我相信，将来还会发生更重大的决定性的作用。京剧界有些朋友看不起地方戏，实在是错误的。您对地方戏如此重视，就更值得大家学习了。您指摘了盲目崇拜西洋的风气与对自己民族历史遗产的忽略，这些意见都是很正确的。但您认为把直接写实的方法渗入到旧戏里去，使旧剧改革走了错路，这一点似有考虑的余地。我不知道您所谓直接写实的方法是否即是指的话剧的手法？旧剧的改革固然需要适当地顾及中国民族歌剧所固有的许多特点和优点，不要过于轻易地破坏了它们；但同时也不能完全拒绝采用您所谓直接写实的手法。旧戏真正感人的地方每每正在它的写实力。因此就不应拒绝向话剧电影等兄弟艺术学习。我们不盲目崇拜西洋，却必须向世界古典戏剧遗产、特别是苏联戏剧成就学习和借鉴，在这一点上，我们也不可以有固步自封的见解。我们的民族新歌剧还处在一个创造的、形成的过程中。我们鼓励各种改革的尝试，即使其中某些尝试在初期不可避免地要比较粗糙幼稚或失败，但经过戏剧界相互间的探讨批评与广大群众的鉴定选择，相信必能使我们的民族戏曲更丰富更提高，更能担负历史任务。您说对吗？
    回到本题，您问对各地方戏曲的调查工作，是否还有扩大范围的必要，我认为是有这个必要的。就目前政府力量所能做的，各省市文教主管机关及各文工团须有专门机构或专人来负责这种调查工作。河北、山西两省，已开始这样做，其他地方亦应如此。调查方法，除文字纪录外，最好用录音器将唱词曲调收录下来。调查材料，要多复写几份，以免散失。我们现正计划组织民间文艺研究团体，以便广泛地、大规模地进行征集的工作。您的具体调查计划已拟就否？我很想知道，并愿尽我的力量来帮助您。
    此复，致敬礼               
         周扬
              二月二十日
