Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 18th. Telecommunication Agency Copenhagen News: Martin Nielsen, Secretary of the Secretariat of the Danish Communist Party and Member of Parliament, delivered a speech at a mass meeting in Copenhagen on the evening of the 15th. He said: I have no hesitation in describing the Sino-Soviet Treaty as the greatest political event since the October Revolution. The Danish bourgeois newspapers and the national radio have completely gone bankrupt, have nothing to say, and are no longer able to fabricate any arguments to denigrate the terms of the treaty. Therefore, they have adopted the means of completely not publishing the terms of the treaty, only publishing some fragmented reports and peddled commentaries from British and American radio stations and newspapers.
　　The Danish Communist Party's newspaper "Land and People" wrote: Only countries that have abolished imperialism and all efforts to obtain "spheres of influence" in foreign countries can conclude such a treaty. Only the Soviet Union can conclude such a generous treaty, which stands in stark contrast to the treaties concluded by American imperialism with other countries, which are always accompanied by the acquisition of war bases and other concessions of this kind.
　　Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 18th. Telecommunication Agency Havana News, 17th: The Cuban people, especially the working class, welcomed the announcement of the Sino-Soviet Treaty with great enthusiasm.
　　The newspaper "The Voice" published the announcement of the treaty in a prominent position and devoted a large amount of space to this event. The newspaper also published an editorial entitled "A Typical Example of Relations Between Free Nations," which stated: The Cuban people and all peoples ravaged by imperialism greet the Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance between the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China with pleasure. This treaty is a true example of relations between free countries.
　　The chairman of the Cuban People's Socialist Party (i.e., the Communist Party), Mariñelo, said when meeting with reporters: The Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance is one of the most important events of our time. Everyone in the world is delighted with this treaty, and only those imperialists and warmongers feel fear and hatred in the depths of their souls.

　　自由民族间关系的典型
    丹麦古巴人民欢迎中苏新条约
    【新华社北京十八日电】电通社哥本哈根讯：丹麦共产党书记处书记及国会议员马丁·尼尔森于十五日夜在哥本哈根的群众大会上发表演说。他说：我毫不犹豫地将中苏条约描述为自十月革命以来的最巨大的政治事件。丹麦的资产阶级报纸和国家广播已经完全破产，无话可说，也没有能力再制造出任何论据来诋毁条约的条款，因此，它们竟采取完全不发表条约条款的手段，只发表一些自英美电台和报纸得来的零碎报道和贩来的评论。
    丹麦共产党机关报《国土与人民》撰文称：只有废除了帝国主义和废除了在外国获得“势力范围”的一切努力的国家，才能缔订此种条约。只有苏联才能缔订此种慷慨的条约，这种条约和美帝国主义与别国所订的、永远是伴随着取得战争基地及诸如此类的其他让步的条约，成为鲜明的对照。
    【新华社北京十八日电】电通社哈瓦那十七日讯：古巴人民特别是工人阶级以很大的热情来欢迎中苏条约的宣布。
    《呼声》报以显著地位刊出了条约的宣布并以该报的很大的篇幅登载这一事件。该报并发表题为《自由民族间关系的典型》的社论称：古巴人民和一切受帝国主义蹂躏的人民，以愉快的心情来迎接苏联与中华人民共和国之间的友好同盟互助条约。这一条约是自由国家之间的关系的一个真正典型。
    古巴人民社会党（即共产党）主席马里涅罗于接见记者时称：中苏友好同盟互助条约，是我们这一时代的最重要事件之一。世界上一切人都对这一条约欢欣鼓舞，只有那些帝国主义者与战争贩子们的灵魂深处感到恐惧与仇恨。
