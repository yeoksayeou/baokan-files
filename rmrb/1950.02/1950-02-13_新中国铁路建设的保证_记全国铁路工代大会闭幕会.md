　　Guarantee of New China's Railway Construction
    ——A Record of the Closing Ceremony of the National Railway Workers' Congress
    By our reporter Chen Ji

    On February 12th, the National Congress of the Chinese Railway Union victoriously concluded, and the National Committee of the Chinese Railway Union was declared established. Sitting in the closing ceremony hall was Ji Gensheng, with his white hair, who twenty-eight years ago led the workers of the Zhengtai Railway in a strike against French imperialism, monitoring the enemy and seizing their pistols. Today, in the liberated Shijiazhuang Railway Factory, he is leading young workers, initiating a production emulation movement, earning the title of honorary model worker, and being elected as a member of the Shijiazhuang Municipal People's Government. Also in the hall, Liang Yongfu, the "February 7th" hero, repeatedly shouted in a loud voice, "Guarantee and exceed this year's task!" In the "February 7th" era, he represented the workers of the Zhengtai Railway to participate in the establishment meeting of the Beijing-Hankou Railway Union in Zhengzhou, organizing workers to respond to the heroic call of martyr Lin Xiangqian: "The head can be cut off, but the train must not be stopped!" Today, he is doing union work in Taiyuan, leading workers to work hard in production. After participating in the Second Congress of the World Federation of Trade Unions, he said to everyone he met: "Our working class all over the world must unite and resolutely oppose the warmongers."

    In the more than three-year history of the People's Railway construction, we have seen thousands upon thousands of new heroes. Like Li Yong, the driver of the "Mao Zedong" locomotive, who is here today, leading the "Mao Zedong" locomotive gloriously into the customs, using the spirit of joint labor of the "Mao Zedong" locomotive to drive the Fengtai Locomotive Depot, producing the "May 1 Labor" and Li Yonglu's heroic locomotives, and then riding the "Mao Zedong" locomotive to Zhengzhou, influencing the southern locomotive work and making it move in a new direction. Du Xianyang, the driver of the "Iron Ox" locomotive, first created the model achievement of "running 106,000 kilometers, breaking through two Class A inspections," which made the Northeast launch a widespread Iron Ox movement in August last year, creating 162 Iron Ox locomotives, and producing Wang Fengming's "No. 631" locomotive, which had the highest record of "running 180,000 kilometers, exceeding three Class A inspections." Qi Guizhi, the nationally famous eighteen-year-old female lathe operator, broke the conservative idea in history that "women cannot participate in heavy industrial construction," entered the Dalian Railway Factory under numerous difficulties and obstacles, learned technology, and made screws faster than ordinary male workers. More than 100 women, influenced by her, participated in the work of the Dalian Railway Factory. Chen Zhijiu, a 50-year-old riveter, was promoted to engineer by the Ministry of Railways, breaking the past discriminatory view that "workers cannot be engineers" and pointing out a new development prospect for Chinese workers.

    Today, our trains can run from Manchuria to Guangzhou; our railways have been extended by more than 8,000 kilometers in the past year; and this year our transportation tasks are planned to increase by double compared to last year. This is the result of the unprecedented and tremendous efforts of Chinese railway workers and countless heroes under the leadership of the Communist Party in history.

    When I heard Commander-in-Chief Zhu, Secretary-General Lin Boqu, Vice Premier Dong Biwu, and Minister Teng Daiyuan thanking the national railway workers on behalf of the people of the whole country at the National Railway Workers' Congress, and when I saw hundreds of bright red banners sent from all over the country praising the national railway workers, I personally heard the excellent railway worker representatives from all over the country say very humbly: "Our work last year was not good enough, we still have to learn, learn from the advanced Soviet Union."

    After Minister Teng Daiyuan reported "Strive to complete and exceed this year's railway construction plan," I saw the national railway labor heroes, worker representatives, union workers, technicians, and staff members speaking non-stop, unanimously proposing their guarantees in a firm tone: "We support the 1950 plan proposed by Minister Teng, we not only guarantee that this plan will be fully realized, but we will also exceed this plan." The representative of the Shanghai Bureau said: "In order to complete the task, our Shanghai Bureau will launch a competition with the railway bureaus of Northeast China and Tianjin." The representative of the Tianjin Bureau immediately responded: "Accept your challenge, we will also compete with railway bureaus all over the country, we must complete this year's task."

    At the closing ceremony, we cheered the establishment of the National Committee of the Chinese Railway Union, and we saw the representatives unanimously and enthusiastically pass six draft resolutions. The "Draft Constitution of the Chinese Railway Union" stipulates the general program for the struggle of railway workers across the country, further unifying the national railway union organization. Since the Northeast Railway implemented the "Northeast Public Enterprise Wartime Labor Insurance Regulations" in April last year, the labor enthusiasm and work efficiency of the vast number of employees have been significantly improved because they have obtained reliable guarantees in their lives. Due to different circumstances in the past, the methods and standards for solving life, old age, illness, death, and disability events in various bureaus within the customs are extremely inconsistent, and the production enthusiasm of employees has been affected. Therefore, the conference decided to formulate the "Provisional Measures for Labor Insurance of Railway Workers Nationwide" based on the Northeast Labor Insurance Regulations and suggested that the government adopt and implement them. This will unify the labor insurance treatment of railway workers across the country. The "Draft Outline of National Railway Collective Contract" is a strong guarantee for completing and striving to exceed the railway construction and transportation tasks assigned by the state. The "Draft Provisional Measures on Carrying out Rationalization Proposals" is an effective weapon to combine the labor enthusiasm and technological improvement of the vast number of employees, and overcome the difficulties and shortcomings in business management and production technology in the future. The "Draft Outline of the Railway Workers' Education Plan" pointed out the basic principles and methods of mass education, so that the technical, cultural, and political education of employees can be combined with the current transportation, production tasks, and the existing level of employees, and continuously and gradually improved, in order to better build a new China. The "Draft Measures for Railway Workers' Mutual Assistance" is a welfare organization for mass mutual assistance and mutual benefit of grassroots trade unions, and an effective way to solve unexpected difficulties in the lives of employees outside the provisions of labor insurance.

　　新中国铁路建设的保证
    ——记全国铁路工代大会闭幕会
    本报记者  陈迹
    二月十二日，中国铁路工会全国代表大会胜利闭幕了，中国铁路工会全国委员会宣告成立了。闭幕会的会场上坐着的白发斑斑的计根生，曾在二十八年前反对法帝国主义的罢工斗争中，领导正太铁路工人，监视敌人，抢夺敌人的手枪；今天他在解放后的石家庄铁路工厂带着年青工人，掀起生产竞赛运动，争得了荣誉模范勋章，被选为石家庄市人民政府的委员。又如在会场上一再以洪亮的声音高呼“保证并超过今年的任务”的“二七”英雄梁永福，在“二七”时代曾代表正太线铁路工人参加郑州的京汉铁路工会的成立大会，组织工人响应林祥谦烈士的“头可断，车不可通”的英勇号召；今天他又在太原做工会工作，领导工人努力生产。当他参加了世界工联第二次代表大会以后，他逢人就说：“我们全世界工人阶级要团结起来，坚决反对战争贩子。”
    在三年多的人民铁道建设史上，我们又看见了千千万万的新英雄。像今天在座的有“毛泽东号”司机长李永，他率领着“毛泽东号”机车光荣进关，以“毛泽东号”的联合劳动的热忱精神，把丰台机务段带动起来，产生了“五一劳动号”和李永禄的英雄机车之后，又乘着“毛泽东号”机车到郑州，影响南方机务工作使之走向新的方向。“铁牛号”机车司机长杜先扬首先创造了“走行十万六千公里，突破两个甲检期”的模范事迹，使东北在去年八月展开了广泛的铁牛运动，造成了一百六十二台铁牛机车，产生了王凤鸣的“六三一号”机车“走行十八万公里，超过三个甲检期”的最高纪录。闻名全国的十八岁的女镟工戚桂枝，打破历史上“女人不能参加重工业建设”的保守思想，在困难重重的阻挠下进入大连铁路工厂，学会技术，做出比一般男工还要快的镟螺丝钉。一百多个妇女在她的影响下，参加了大连铁路工厂工作。五十多岁的铆工陈志久，获得了铁道部提升为工程师，打破过去“工人不能做工程师”的歧视观点，给中国工人指出了新的发展前途。
    今天，我们的火车，可以从满洲里开到广州；我们的铁路在去年一年内修通八千多公里；今年我们的运输任务将计划比去年增加到一倍。这是历史上中国铁路工人及无数英雄在共产党领导下空前巨大的努力结果。
    当我在全国铁路工代大会上，听见了朱总司令、林伯渠秘书长、董必武副总理、滕代远部长代表全国人民感谢全国铁路工人的时候，看见了全国各地送来的上百数的鲜红锦旗赞扬全国铁路工人的时候，我亲自听到从全国来的优秀的铁路工人代表们都非常虚心地说：“去年我们的工作做得还不够，我们还要学习，学习先进的苏联。”
    当滕代远部长报告“为完成并超过今年铁路建设计划而奋斗”之后，我又看到了全国铁路劳动英雄、工人代表、工会工作者、技术人员、职员们不停地发言，一致以坚决的口吻提出了他们的保证：“我们拥护滕部长提出的一九五○年计划，我们不仅保证这个计划全部实现，我们还要超过这个计划。”上海局代表说：“为了完成任务，我们上海局要和东北、天津的铁路管理局展开竞赛。”天津局代表马上响应：“接受你们的挑战，我们还要和全国各局竞赛，我们一定要完成今年的任务。”
    在闭幕大会上，我们欢呼中国铁路工会全国委员会的成立，我们看见代表们一致热烈通过六大决议草案。“中国铁路工会章程草案”规定了全国铁路工人奋斗的总纲，进一步统一了全国铁路工会组织。由于东北铁路自去年四月份实行“东北公营企业战时劳动保险条例”后，广大职工因生活上获得了可靠的保障，劳动情绪、工作效率均有显著提高。关内各局因过去情况不同，解决生、老、病、死、残等事件的办法和标准极不统一，职工生产情绪受到影响。因此大会决定以东北劳动保险条例为准绳拟订“全国铁路职工劳动保险暂行办法”，建议政府采纳施行。这样就统一了全国铁路职工的劳保待遇。“全国铁路集体合同纲要草案”是保证完成并争取超过国家赋予的铁道建设与运输任务的有力保证。“关于开展合理化建议暂行办法草案”是使得广大职工的劳动热忱与技术改进结合起来，克服今后业务管理、生产技术中的困难和缺陷的有效武器。“铁路职工教育计划纲要草案”，指出了群众性教育的基本原则和方法，使得对职工进行技术、文化、政治的教育能够结合当前运输、生产任务及职工现有水平，不断地逐步地提高，以便更好地建设新中国。“铁路职工互助办法草案”是基层工会的群众互助互济的福利组织，是解决职工在劳动保险规定以外生活上意外困难的有效办法。
