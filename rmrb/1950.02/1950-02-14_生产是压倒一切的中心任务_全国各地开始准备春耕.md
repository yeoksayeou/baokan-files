Xinhua News Agency, Hankou, February 11th: Production is the Overriding Central Task; Spring Ploughing Preparations Begin Across the Country; Manure Accumulation, Ploughing, and Farm Tool Preparation; Central and Southern China Intensifies Spring Ploughing Preparations.

Peasants in various parts of Central and Southern China are intensifying their spring ploughing preparations. Significant achievements have been made in accumulating fertilizer. For example, in Wanshi Village, Suichuan, Jiangxi, 112 people collected 6,720 catties of manure in two days. In Gaolu Township, Ningxiang County, Hunan, 8,200 mu of grass seeds were planted as spring ploughing fertilizer. In Xiangtan County, 201 lime kilns have resumed production, burning a large amount of lime for spring ploughing and fertilization. The Xiping County People's Government in Henan is preparing to establish a fertilizer cooperative to purchase large quantities of fertilizer and encourage peasants to accumulate more manure. Simultaneously with manure accumulation, many peasants in Hubei, Hunan, Jiangxi, and other provinces are using the winter slack season to plough their paddy fields once in preparation for spring rice transplanting. In Nanchang, Fengcheng, Xinjian, Gaoan, and other counties in Jiangxi, 498,000 mu of paddy fields were ploughed by the end of December last year. In Changsha County, Hunan, paddy fields have now been generally ploughed once. In terms of draught cattle and farm tool preparation, many peasants in various regions have used the fruits of their victory in the anti-despot and rent reduction struggles to buy farm tools and draught cattle. Two villages in Nanhu Township, Yongxiu County, Jiangxi, bought 20 draught cattle. Tanghu Village, Xingning County, Guangdong, organized a farm tool production cooperative to manufacture farm tools in large quantities. Peasants in a village in Tangjiang District, Nankang, Jiangxi, jointly repaired three waterwheels. The farm tool manufacturing factory of the provincial Department of Agriculture and Forestry has begun to rush production of agricultural engines, with an estimated completion of 80 units by the end of May to meet the needs of peasants. The Hunan Provincial Government instructed governments at all levels to lead peasants to prepare various ploughs, harrows, hoes, waterwheels, etc., before spring ploughing. In terms of seed preparation, Hubei Province provided 20 million catties of grain loans to help peasants purchase seeds. The Jiangxi Department of Agriculture and Forestry purchased 1,350 dan of cotton seeds in Shanghai and other places to lend to cotton farmers to increase cotton planting area. At the same time, peasants in various places are using the money earned from sideline production to purchase seeds. For example, the joint organization of the 12th and 13th districts of Linfeng Township, Xiangtan, Hunan, organized coal mining teams, planning to save two shi of grain to buy seeds. In terms of repairing dikes, building dams, and opening canals, various regions are actively proceeding. The Hubei Provincial People's Government is preparing to allocate agricultural water conservancy loans of 7.5 million to 10 million yuan specifically to support peasants in repairing ponds, weirs, and dams. Peasants in Shangshui, Henan, dug seven large and small canals in 20 days. With the assistance of the People's Government, the masses of seven villages in Sanyi Township, Fushi District, Nankang, Jiangxi, rebuilt the Gao Kan Canal, which had dried up, in preparation for irrigating fields.

Guangdong Provincial People's Government Issues Instructions on Agricultural Production

Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou: The Guangdong Provincial People's Government recently issued instructions on developing agricultural production and actively preparing for spring ploughing. The instructions require the province to increase grain production by 5% to 10% this year to make up for the province's shortage of 10 million dan of grain. In addition to increasing grain production, the instructions also call on various localities to plant special crops in large quantities, increase the production of cotton, ramie, and other crops, actively promote household sideline production, and increase peasant income. To ensure the completion of the above tasks, the instructions point out that it is necessary to vigorously mobilize the masses to build water conservancy projects, change the conservative thinking of peasants, increase labor enthusiasm, improve farming methods, promote intensive cultivation, collect fertilizer, regulate seeds, and appropriately solve the difficulties of peasants' draught cattle and farm tools. Secondly, incentives should be given for land reclamation and afforestation, stipulating that whoever reclaims the land owns the harvest. In order to stabilize and improve the production enthusiasm of peasants, the instructions stipulate that, except for the land of war criminals and heinous special agents and incorrigible reactionary despots, which can be managed by the county government after being approved by the special commissioner's office and approved by the provincial government, all other land shall remain unchanged before land reform. The land of fleeing landlords and public land with no one to cultivate will be managed and operated by the government above the district level. Freedom of employment should be guaranteed in rural areas, with wages agreed upon by both parties; freedom of borrowing should be guaranteed, with interest agreed upon by both parties. Rent reduction should be thoroughly implemented to increase peasant income, and tenancy rights should be effectively protected, and the original cultivated land should be used as the basis for supplementary distribution when land reform is implemented in the future. The instructions finally point out that in order to complete the task of increasing production, various localities should convene district and township peasant representative conferences or village peasant conferences before spring ploughing to publicize the laws and decrees of the People's Government on restoring and developing production, effectively solve the various difficulties of peasants in production, and organize peasant mutual aid and labor exchange groups. Rural organizations such as peasant associations, youth leagues, and women's associations should focus their work during the spring ploughing period on promoting and developing this year's great production movement. During the busy farming season, all government agencies, schools, and troops should extract as much manpower and animal power as possible to help the masses produce, first of all helping the families of martyrs and revolutionary soldiers and the families of migrant workers who lack labor, and strive to cherish and save manpower.

Shaanxi Agricultural Production Conference Decides on Grain and Cotton Production Increase Tasks

Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, February 11th: Shaanxi Province convened an agricultural production conference from January 27th to February 2nd. Attendees included representatives from southern Shaanxi, Guanzhong, and northern Shaanxi. Heads of relevant departments, experts, and peasants with production experience were also invited to participate. The conference decided on the principle of restoring agricultural production as the main task for the province this year and determined the task of increasing food grain production by 1.1 million shi and ginned cotton by 200,000 dan for the whole province this year. In order to complete the above grain and cotton production increase tasks, the conference also stipulated the following specific measures: (1) Organize labor and implement intensive cultivation, and advocate hoeing wheat more than once in some areas; (2) Restore 700,000 mu of fallow land in northern Shaanxi and reclaim 20,000 mu of virgin land in the Qianshan reclamation area to expand the cultivated area; (3) Build water conservancy projects: This year, the province plans to build 11 canals including Jinghui, Weihui, and Meihui, expand the irrigation area by 300,000 to 345,000 mu, dig 1,000 wells, and manufacture 3,500 waterwheels to irrigate 20,000 mu of land; (4) Launch a mass movement for manure accumulation and fertilization; (5) Promote superior varieties and prevent and control pests; (6) The People's Government will issue agricultural loans and agricultural investments to help peasants solve the difficulties of seeds, fertilizers, draught animals, and farm tools with a focus and plan; (7) Local governments should be highly vigilant about areas where disasters may occur, and prepare coping methods as early as possible; in areas where disasters have occurred or will occur, they must go deep into the disaster areas, implement the principle of production for self-rescue, launch and organize people's production mutual assistance, sow early-maturing crops, strengthen transportation, and practice thrift; (8) Pay attention to preserving farm tools and developing livestock to prepare favorable conditions for this year's great production movement; (9) Pay attention to protecting and creating economic forests. The conference finally clearly pointed out that in order to realize the above plan, all localities must launch a mass production movement with unified ideological leadership, and all cadres must ideologically realize that all policies are for restoring and developing production, and must always take into account whether it hinders the interests of developing production when implementing policies. In addition, all localities should widely organize labor mutual aid in rural areas on the basis of voluntary mutual benefit, and mobilize women to participate in agricultural production. Local leading organs should implement key leadership, break through one point, create experience, and promote the overall situation, and at the same time implement a regular inspection system to improve work at any time.

Implement the Policy of Protecting Livestock: Shanxi Increased Draught Animals by 150,000 Head Last Year

This Newspaper: Shanxi Province increased draught animals by approximately 150,000 head last year. This year, it plans to breed 100,000 draught animals and vigorously carry out livestock epidemic prevention and injection work. Over the past year, people's governments at all levels in the province have helped peasants purchase, breed, and protect livestock in an organized and led manner. People's banks in 46 counties across the province have issued loans of 272.07 million yuan and grain loans of 13.738 million catties to help peasants purchase livestock. At the same time, economic departments at all levels have organized public and private livestock dealers, combined with rural idle funds and mass free shareholding, to go to Shaanxi, Henan, Chahar, Suiyuan, and other livestock producing areas to buy back a large number of livestock. In order to breed livestock, the provincial government established and improved 11 livestock promotion societies or forestry and animal husbandry bureaus in Taiyue, Huoshan, Tainan, Heshun, Fangshan, Wutai, and other places. Many counties and districts have established insemination stations and livestock breeding committees. Seminars for breeding livestock households have been held many times to exchange experiences. Jinnan counties have promoted the practice of breeding livestock personnel taking turns going to the countryside and the "contract system." Wang Fanshen of Yuncheng, the province, completed the annual insemination plan of 80 livestock in three months. In addition, governments at all levels in the province resolutely implemented various policies to protect livestock, which encouraged peasants to increase livestock breeding. Jinan alone increased livestock by more than 40,000 heads. Linfen County originally planned to increase 800 heads, but exceeded 300 heads. Qinyuan County increased livestock by more than 10,000 heads. Six or seven districts in Pingshun County increased livestock by 896 heads, exceeding the original plan by 28%. The province totaled an increase of about 150,000 draught animals.

However, livestock epidemics in various parts of the province are still serious, such as mange, anthrax, bovine anthrax, and emphysema gangrene. The four veterinary prevention and control teams of the former Taihang and Taiyue conducted epidemic prevention injections on 90,000 livestock in 30 counties in Changzhi, Xin County, and other special areas with severe livestock epidemics. According to statistics from the former Taiyue area, the livestock mortality rate last year decreased from 5% in the previous year to 1.8%. At present, there are a total of 1.04 million draught animals in the province, only 50% of the pre-war level. Two-fifths are old and weak, and peasants lack scientific knowledge of livestock breeding management, and livestock epidemics have not stopped spreading so far. In addition, according to statistics from 19 counties in Jinzhong, there are only 160,000 draught animals for 11.2 million mu of land, and each draught animal needs to cultivate 78 mu of land, and the number of draught animals is extremely insufficient. Therefore, in addition to deciding to breed 100,000 livestock in 1950, the Shanxi Provincial People's Government requires that 30% to 40% of the province's draught animals be injected with epidemic prevention.

    【新华社西安十一日电】陕西省于上月二十七日至本月二日召开农业生产会议。出席会议者有陕南、关中、陕北各地代表。会议并邀请各有关部门首长、专家及有生产经验的农民参加。会上决定了今年全省农业生产以恢复为主的方针，并确定全省今年增产食粮一百一十万市石、皮棉二十万市担的任务。为完成上述粮棉增产任务，会议并规定如下具体办法：（一）组织劳动力，实行精耕细作，在部分地区提倡麦子多锄一遍；（二）陕北恢复熟荒七十万亩，汧山垦区增开生荒二万亩，以扩大耕地面积；（三）兴修水利：本年度计划全省兴修泾惠、渭惠、梅惠等十一个渠，扩大灌溉面积三十万至三十四万五千亩，凿井一千眼，制造水车三千五百辆，灌田两万亩；（四）发动群众积肥和施肥运动；（五）推广优良品种，防治虫害；（六）人民政府发放农业贷款和农业投资，有重点、有计划地帮助农民解决种子、肥料、耕畜和农具的困难；（七）对可能发生灾荒的地区，当地人民政府应高度警惕，及早准备克服办法；对已经发生和将要发生灾荒的地区，则必须深入灾区，执行生产自救的方针，发动与组织人民生产互助，播种早熟作物，加强运输，厉行节约；（八）要注意保存农具和发展牲畜，为今年大生产运动准备有利条件；（九）注意保护与营造经济林木。会议最后明确指出，为实现上述计划，各地必须发动一个有统一思想领导的群众性的大生产运动，一切干部必须从思想上认识到一切政策都是为了恢复和发展生产，在执行政策时必须经常照顾到是否妨碍发展生产的利益。另外，各地应在自愿互利的基础上广泛组织农村中的劳动互助，发动广大妇女参加农业生产。各地领导机关应实行重点领导，突破一点，创造经验，推动全面，同时实行经常的巡视检查制度，以便随时改进工作。
    贯彻保护牲畜政策
    山西去年增加耕畜十五万头
    【本报讯】山西省去年约增加耕畜十五万头。今年计划繁殖耕畜十万头，并大力进行牲畜防疫注射工作。一年来，该省各级人民政府曾有组织、有领导的帮助农民购买、繁殖和保护牲畜。全省有四十六个县的人民银行曾发放贷款二亿七千二百零七万元，贷粮一千三百七十三万八千斤，帮助农民购买牲畜。同时，各级经济部门并组织公私畜贩，结合乡村游资和群众自由集股，前往陕西、河南、察绥等产畜区，买回大批牲畜。为了繁殖牲畜，该省政府建立、健全了太岳、霍山、太南、和顺、方山、五台等十一个畜牧推进社或林牧局。许多县、区，成立了交配站、牲畜繁殖委员会。多次召开种畜户座谈会，交流经验。晋南各县推行了种畜人轮流下乡和“包配制”。该省运城王翻身，三个月即完成全年配种八十头牲口的计划。加上全省各级政府坚决执行了保护牲畜的各种政策，鼓舞了农民增养牲畜的热情。仅晋南二十八县增畜四万余头。临汾县原计划增加八百头，结果超过三百头。沁源一县即增畜万余头。平顺县六、七两区增加牲畜八百九十六头，超过原计划百分之二十八。全省总计约增加耕畜十五万头。
    但全省各地发生的畜疫，仍然严重。如疥癣、炭疽、牛疽、气肿疽等。原太行、太岳等四个兽医防治队，在畜疫较重的长治、忻县等专区三十个县，防疫注射牲畜九万头。按原太岳区统计：去年牲畜死亡率由前年百分之五，减至百分之一点八。现全省共有耕畜一百零四万头，仅及战前百分之五十。有五分之二系老弱，且农民对牲畜饲养管理上缺乏科学知识，畜疫至今仍未停止流行。此外，据晋中十九个县统计：一千一百二十万亩土地，只有耕畜十六万头，每头耕畜需耕地七十八亩，耕畜数量极感不足。因此，山西省人民政府除决定一九五○年繁殖牲畜十万头外，全省百分之三十至四十耕畜，要进行防疫注射。
