　　[Beijing News] The Beijing Municipal People's Victory Real Value Public Bond Sales Committee convened a mobilization meeting on the 4th with more than 500 local figures to encourage the purchase of public bonds. At the meeting, local figures unanimously expressed that they would not lag behind in loving the country and would definitely work hard to complete the task of purchasing the originally allocated 700,000 shares of public bonds. Le Songsheng and Zhang Shouchong took the lead on the spot and subscribed to a total of 25,000 shares. Fu Huating and Han Songshang from the business community spoke at the meeting, encouraging everyone not to have any concerns and to actively purchase. Local figures Le Songsheng, Lu Yaxuan, Zheng Zipan, Feng Zhanhai, and others spoke one after another, unanimously believing that the country's issuance of such a people's, victorious, and real value public bond is entirely for the liberation of the people of the whole country and for the people's economic construction. The burden of the War of Liberation on us local figures living in Beijing is too light compared to the peasants, and we should now actively purchase and quickly complete the tasks we should bear. Le Songsheng also subscribed to 13,000 shares of public bonds on the spot (in addition to the more than 20,000 shares subscribed in the industrial and commercial sectors), and Zhang Shouchong subscribed to 12,000 shares. Cheng Hongyi, Deputy Director of the Municipal Finance and Economics Committee, said in his speech that the leading subscription of Mr. Le Songsheng and Mr. Zhang Shouchong is a concrete manifestation of loving their country and supporting their government, and is worthy of everyone's admiration and learning. He hoped that local figures in the city would actively purchase and called on everyone to quickly organize public bond sales branches and groups in various districts to widely and deeply publicize and explain, actively participate in sales work, and strive to smoothly and quickly complete the glorious task of local figures subscribing to 700,000 shares of public bonds.
