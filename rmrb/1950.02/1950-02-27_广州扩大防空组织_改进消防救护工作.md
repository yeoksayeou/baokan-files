　　Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, February 26th: In order to strengthen air defense work, the Guangzhou Municipal People's Government has expanded the organization of the Air Defense Committee, absorbing personnel from major municipal organs, organizations, and democratic parties to participate in the work of the Air Defense Committee. The committee is actively strengthening the work of the air defense intelligence network, establishing observation posts, and improving firefighting, rescue, traffic control, and light control work. Air defense committees and rescue teams have been universally organized in various districts, major production units, and organs. The committee called on citizens to heighten their vigilance, strengthen support for the front lines, purchase public bonds, and prohibit the use of Hong Kong currency, to help the government overcome difficulties and quickly liberate Hainan Island and Taiwan, in response to the dying struggle of the Kuomintang reactionaries. According to reports, Kuomintang bandit aircraft have invaded Guangzhou a total of 76 times since November of last year, dispatching 84 aircraft, causing 117 civilian casualties, which has aroused widespread resentment among the people of Guangzhou.
