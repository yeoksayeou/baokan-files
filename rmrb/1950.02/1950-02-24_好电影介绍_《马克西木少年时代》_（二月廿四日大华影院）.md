Good Movie Recommendation
　　"The Childhood of Maxim Gorky"
    (February 24th, Dahua Cinema)
　　In Tsarist Russia, workers labored under extremely harsh conditions, and many were tortured to death. However, capitalists still refused to improve working conditions. The Bolshevik Party fought for this, and Maxim participated in political demonstrations, later joining the party. He grew up in battle and became a strong and courageous fighter. After receiving orders from his superiors, he gladly left the one he loved – Natasha.
    Maxim was not a great man, but just an ordinary worker. However, in the midst of struggle, he was able to transform from being unawakened to becoming a professional revolutionary – a Bolshevik Party member and an active participant in the great October Revolution. Therefore, he appeared even greater in his ordinariness.

　　《马克西木少年时代》
    （二月廿四日大华影院）
    帝俄时，工人们在极刻苦的条件下劳动着，许多人被折磨死，然而资本家仍旧不肯改善劳动条件。布尔什维克党为此而斗争，马克西木参加了政治游行示威，以后并入了党，在战斗里成长，而成为一个坚强、勇敢的战士。他在接受上级命令之后，欣然的离开他所爱的人——娜塔沙。
    马克西木并不是了不起的伟人，只是一个平凡的工人。但他能在斗争中间由不觉悟转变到职业革命家——布尔什维克党员，伟大的十月革命积极参加者，所以他在平凡中就愈显得伟大。
