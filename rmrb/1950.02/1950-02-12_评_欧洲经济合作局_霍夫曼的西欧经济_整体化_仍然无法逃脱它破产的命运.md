　　Commentary on the "European Economic Cooperation Administration"
    Hoffman's Western European Economic "Integration" Still Cannot Escape Its Fate of Bankruptcy
    Electric News Agency
    [Xinhua News Agency dispatch] Electric News Agency, Paris, February 2nd: Yesterday, Dutch Foreign Minister Stikker was elected as the "Political Commissioner" of the European Economic Cooperation Administration (EECA), the sole "achievement" of this meeting of the EECA Ministerial Council held here. The meeting's original purpose was to take steps, according to Hoffman's orders, to "integrate" the economy of Western Europe. Stikker will not have sufficient power. In fact, regarding his future position, only one thing is clear now: he will act as the EECA's diplomatic representative in relations with Washington. The fact that he remains Foreign Minister in itself shows that people do not expect Stikker to do much more. Hoffman will still encounter many difficulties on the road to "integration"—that is, to establishing a single, vast European market for American goods.

    During the meeting, Hoffman openly spoke of his "disappointment." The Americans had originally chosen former Belgian Foreign Minister Spaak as the candidate for EECA President, granting him very broad powers to force Marshall Plan countries to implement American orders. The failure of this plan is mainly due to British opposition, and Hoffman retaliated against Britain by stating that the Marshall Plan Administration will only support those who spare no effort to achieve European economic cooperation in the future.

    Britain's opposition stems from the following fear: if the EECA is strengthened, it will exercise power over the entire sterling area now ruled by London; in other words, the Americans, while colonizing Western Europe, will kill two birds with one stone and also colonize the British Empire. The implicit American threat to Britain was pointed out by the influential *Washington Post*. The newspaper stated on the 1st that opposing Spaak was a "blow" to Hoffman, and then stated that Hoffman could only obtain funds from the US Congress on the basis of developing European "integration."

    The EECA's promise to establish Western European economic unity is described as "empty talk." In fact, the Paris meeting, apart from passing the concept of the European Payments Union "in principle," did not agree on any "integration" measures. The bankrupt Marshall Plan countries are more concerned with fighting each other for dollar appropriations that have been reduced by the US Congress than with merging their bankrupt economies into a bankrupt whole.

    Moreover, as *The New York Times* pointed out last week, Marshall Plan governments argue that while Hoffman teaches them to "integrate" their economies, they do not see such "integration" in American economic policy. One example is the proposed Western European Payments Union. This was Hoffman's idea, designed to unify control over the Western European economy through currency manipulation. Through the Western European Payments Union, Hoffman would be able to dictate the terms of trade between Western European countries. But shortly before Hoffman left Europe, the US Department of Agriculture announced its opposition to this plan, mainly fearing that establishing a clearing system that included Europe and the sterling area would create discrimination against American agricultural exports, and favor agricultural exports from the sterling area.

    This is just a difference in opinion, not a difference in principle. Because whether it is Hoffman or the US Department of Agriculture, both want to promote American exports. But they cannot escape the ruthless reality that when the Marshall Plan ends in two years, Western Europe will still have a deficit of 2.5 billion US dollars with the United States.

    No matter how hard Hoffman tries, he still finds that he cannot overcome the contradiction between America's desire to dump goods and Europe's inability to buy, as well as the contradictions between Western European countries.

### 评“欧洲经济合作局”  霍夫曼的西欧经济“整体化”仍然无法逃脱它破产的命运

　　评“欧洲经济合作局”
    霍夫曼的西欧经济“整体化”仍然无法逃脱它破产的命运
    电通社
    【新华社讯】电通社巴黎二日电：昨天荷外长斯蒂克被选为欧洲经济合作局的“政治专员”，是经合局部长理事会这次在此举行会议的唯一“成就”。这会议的目的原是为了按照霍夫曼的命令采取步骤使西欧的经济“整体化”。斯蒂克将没有什么充分的权力。事实上，关于他的未来职务，现在只有一点是清楚的，即他将作为经合局在对华盛顿关系中的外交代表行事。他之仍任外长，本身就表明了人家并不希望斯蒂克作更多事情。而霍夫曼在走向“整体化”——即为美国货物建立一个单一的广大欧洲市场的道路上，仍将遭遇许多困难。
    在会议时，霍夫曼曾公开谈到他的“失望”。美国人原先是选择前比外长斯巴克为经合局总裁的候选人，予以非常广泛的权力，来强迫马歇尔化国家执行美国的命令。这个计划的没有成功，主要是由于英国的反对，而霍夫曼则给英国以打击，他表示马歇尔计划执行局以后将只扶助那些不遗余力地以求达到欧洲经济合作的国家。
    英国的反对，是出于下述恐惧：如果经合局加强了，它就会对现在由伦敦统治的整个英镑区行使权力；换言之，美国人在把西欧殖民地化时，将一箭双雕地把大英帝国也殖民地化起来。美国对英国如箭在弦上的恐吓，为有影响的《华盛顿邮报》所指出。该报一日称，反对斯巴克是对霍夫曼的“打击”，继称，霍夫曼只有在发展欧洲的“整体化”的基础上，才能得到美国国会的款项。
    经合局建立西欧经济统一的诺言，被描写为“一篇空话”。事实上，巴黎的这次会议除了“在原则上”通过了欧洲清账同盟的概念以外，并没有协议任何“整体化”的措施。破产了的马歇尔化国家，对于为了被美国国会所削减的美元拨款而互相斗争，比对他们把破产了的经济合并成为一个破产的整体，更其关心。
    尤有进者，如纽约时报上星期所指出的，马歇尔化各国政府争辩说：霍夫曼虽然教诲把他们的经济“整体化”，但在美国的经济政策里却看不到这种“整体化”。一个例子就是拟议中的西欧清算同盟。这是霍夫曼想出来的，旨在经过货币操纵，以统一对西欧经济的控制，经由西欧清算同盟，霍夫曼将能够支配西欧各国相互间的贸易条款。但在霍夫曼离欧前不久，美国农业部宣布反对这个计划，主要是害怕建立一个包括欧洲和英镑地区的清算体系，会造成一种对美国农产品出口的歧视，而有利于英镑区的农产品出口。
    这只是一种看法上的分歧，而不是原则上的分歧。因为不管霍夫曼或美国农业部，都是想推进美国的输出的。但是他们却逃不脱这无情的现实，即在两年后马歇尔计划结束时，西欧对美国仍将有二十五亿美元的赤字。
    不管霍夫曼怎样努力，他还是发觉了无法克服美国的希望倾销和欧洲的无力购买之间的矛盾，以及西欧国家之间的矛盾。
