　　The Issue of Timeliness in News Reporting
    Cheng Yejing
    Our news reporting work still suffers from the shortcoming of being slow. This problem mainly occurs among a portion of news workers who came from old liberated area rural newspapers. Long-term work in a rural environment with a decentralized economy and inconvenient transportation has inevitably made some of our comrades lack a sense of time. Rural readers originally did not have as strong a demand for timeliness in newspapers as urban readers, and even when there was a desire to seize time, it was often limited by objective conditions and could not be achieved. As a result, slowness and procrastination became ingrained habits. These thoughts, work styles, and habits are so deeply rooted that today, in a completely different new environment—that is, entering concentrated and complex cities, facing rapidly developing things—our slow work style cannot adapt to this new environment. For example, we often do not understand how to seize, utilize, allocate, and regulate time; we are not good at grasping the central links in complex and ever-changing current affairs; we do not make good use of the relatively convenient transportation tools and modern telecommunications equipment in cities. Therefore, we cannot report important news that should be reported quickly in a timely manner in all situations. In other words, some of us are still "suffering from acclimatization."
    This "acclimatization" problem must be resolved. When subjective thoughts and work styles conflict with the objective environment, if the facts prove that the former lags behind the latter, then we can only use the weapons of criticism and self-criticism to improve our thoughts and work styles. We must understand that the weakness of our thoughts and work styles has hindered the development of our work, prevented our work from meeting the hopes and demands of readers, and sometimes even caused serious political losses, affecting the interests of the country and the people. There have been cases where an important event occurred in a certain place, which had great political significance at the time and had a considerable impact on the whole country. Many readers were eager to know about this event. According to the requirements of the interests of the country and the people, it was also necessary to quickly disseminate it to all of China and the world to expand its political influence. However, the local news workers were slow to report this event accurately and quickly, delaying it for more than ten days. By the time it was finally published, the readers' interest and attention had decreased, and its political influence was greatly weakened. May I ask, what a great political loss this is, how sorry we are to the country and the people, and what a dereliction of duty for news reporters! Therefore, being scattered, slow, and lacking a strong sense of time is not a small problem or a technical problem as some people understand it. As the Xinhua News Agency pointed out: "This is not only a technical problem, but also a result of our lack of political sensitivity, lack of a serious and responsible attitude in work, and a sloppy and careless work style."
    To further explore the reasons for the slowness of news reporting, in addition to the basic problem of thinking and work style, there are the following points:
    (1) The slow and relaxed work style developed in the long-term rural environment makes us lack the ability and habit of issuing drafts on the same day, even for important and urgent events.
    (2) Editors and reporters often lack a concept of telegraph costs and newspaper space, do not save words at all, and the manuscripts are lengthy, which takes time to translate and transmit.
    (3) Some newspapers, news agencies, and organizations lack close contact. Some organizations in various places lack the habit of proactively and timely providing news, and are not good at using newspapers, news agencies, and radio stations to promote their work. The latter are also not good at obtaining daily news from organizations in a timely manner. In this way, some news that should be published publicly is inevitably missed or delayed.
    (4) The set of work organizations, work systems, and work methods formed in the rural environment have not been appropriately and reasonably reformed after entering the city to adapt to the new environment. The editorial department has a large organization, overlapping layers, complicated procedures, low work efficiency, and cannot handle affairs quickly and effectively.
    (5) The long-term rural environment has resulted in a lack of attention to seizing time, so that the staff in each work link—reporters, editors, translators, telegraph operators, proofreaders, and printing workers—generally lack the habit of completing their work on time. They do not link their work with news broadcast time or newspaper publication time, do not know how to calculate time, and lack a timekeeping system.
    Therefore, in order to overcome the slowness of reporting and ensure timely news release, news organizations in various places must first conduct education to strengthen the concept of time among all news workers. This education on the concept of time should not be carried out purely and in isolation, because that is prone to bias; it should be carried out in conjunction with the entire political education of improving work efficiency and strengthening political responsibility. We must make every worker understand that time is not an abstract thing, but is related to our news manuscripts, newspapers, and broadcasts, and has concrete political content. We are by no means striving for time for the sake of striving for time, or striving for time from a purely technical point of view, but striving for time in order to improve the political effect of the news and to play a greater role in promoting actual struggles. The interests of the country and the people may require us to release some news slowly, but most news must be released in a timely manner, and the sooner the better. We must make the staff—especially responsible cadres and editors and reporters—understand that news workers must have a political mind, and must always be concerned about current affairs, political and social changes, in order to grasp the main events and issues in current affairs, understand their situation and significance, and organize reports in a timely manner. Only by cultivating this kind of political sensitivity—which is inseparable from a high degree of political responsibility—can we avoid delaying major work, and distinguish between the primary, secondary, important, and urgent in our work, and arrange our work in an orderly manner. We must make every worker understand that news work is a serious political work, which is closely related to the overall revolutionary struggle of the people. We should engage in this work with a serious attitude, and there should never be sloppy, tired, and irresponsible phenomena.
    Secondly, reporters, editors, and all news workers should learn to seize, utilize, and allocate time. News organizations must maintain close contact with other work organizations and groups, understand the important events that have occurred and may occur every day and in each period, in order to plan news reports and arrange newspaper and radio programs and space, so as not to be flustered when things happen. We must learn to use social forces to help interview news, so as to avoid having reporters participate in or start from scratch in everything, so that they are too busy. We must learn to investigate the main facts and key points clearly at the time of the interview, and write immediately after collecting the information, have the person in charge of the matter review it, and send it out immediately, so as to avoid going back to investigate or find someone to review it later. We must learn the ability to write short news, to summarize important and complex events in concise writing; especially when time is tight, we can first write brief news and send it out as soon as possible, and then make detailed reports. We must learn to be good at arranging work procedures and news programs, and give priority to handling and sending out urgent and important manuscripts or reserving space. We must learn to use telecommunications, telephones, and other convenient transportation tools to transmit news as quickly as possible.
    Thirdly, we must appropriately adjust and improve our organizations and systems to make them more adaptable to the urban environment in order to improve work efficiency. The organization of news organizations should be simple, with fewer layers, especially the process and procedures for handling news manuscripts should be reduced as much as possible. We must simplify our organization to such an extent that important and time-sensitive manuscripts written by reporters and editors can be directly sent to the president, editor-in-chief, or editor-in-chief for review and modification; when writing general manuscripts, we can also maintain close contact with the main person in charge of the news organization. This approach has at least three benefits: First, it improves work efficiency and shortens work time; second, leaders and basic cadres have direct working relationships, which makes it easier to educate and improve the interviewing and writing skills of reporters and editors, and leaders will not be unfamiliar in business; and third, it can save manpower, so that there can be sufficient strength in interviewing and writing work. All systems that are not suitable for the urban environment should be abolished or changed, and necessary work systems should be maintained or established. For example, there must be strict systems for the registration, processing, receipt, dispatch, and transmission of manuscripts, and time must be calculated at each link. Leaders should regularly check the implementation of this system, and should personally supervise the issuance of urgent and important news. In our overall organizational work, we must list the organization of time as an important item.
    However, while we advocate overcoming slowness and striving for timely reporting, we should also pay attention to preventing another bias, which is the unprincipled competition for time. For example, publishing indiscriminately without conducting necessary investigations and research, and without asking whether the news is true and accurate. In thinking, we oppose speed and accuracy and truth, and believe that time is first and everything else can be sloppy. For example, in order to grab time, we do not take care of the interests of the country and the people, do not ask whether the news conforms to the country's program, policies, and laws, and do not care about the impact of the publication on society. We spread rumors and sensationalize as soon as we hear a little news, and issue extra editions and leaflets at will. These excuses and practices are wrong and should not be done. This is a purely technical point of view, the style of old-fashioned journalists, and the method of bourgeois journalists. This kind of practice of grabbing time and competing for readers by any means and regardless of social impact is not surprising in capitalist society, because it is precisely produced by that turbulent society. However, it is unnecessary and should not be done to adopt this approach in a people's democratic society, because it violates the interests of the people and does not conform to the new moral standards. Our news reports are to serve the people, and they should be responsible to the people and the country, and should be subordinate to the requirements of the overall political interests of the people and the country. Therefore, our news must first be true and accurate, and must conform to the interests of the people and the policies of the country. On this basis, we should strive for speed and strive for time, and strive to release it as soon as possible. The reason why we want to give priority to publishing certain news is nothing more than hoping to more effectively educate the people, better exert its political influence, and promote actual work, so that it is more conducive to the people's cause. If the news itself is untrue and does not conform to the policy, it will not only fail to play this positive role, but will also cause bad results and damage the credibility of newspapers, news agencies, and radio stations. Therefore, it is absolutely necessary to establish a correct view on the timeliness of news.

　　新闻报道的时间性问题
    成也竞
    我们的新闻报道工作仍然存在着迟缓的毛病。这种毛病主要地发生在一部分由老解放区农村办报出身的新闻工作者身上。长期地处在经济分散、交通不便的农村环境工作，不免使我们有些同志缺乏时间观念。农村读者对于报纸的时间方面的要求本来不如城市读者强烈，而且那时即使要争取时间，也往往限于客观条件而无法作到，于是迟缓拖沓便积久成习。这种思想、作风和习惯是这样根深蒂固，以致今天到了一个完全两样的新环境，即进入集中而又复杂的城市中，面临着迅速发展的事物，我们的迟缓作风便不能与此新环境相适应。例如，我们往往不懂得怎样去争取、利用、支配和调节时间，不能善于掌握复杂多变的当前事物中的中心环节，不会很好地利用城市中相当便利的交通工具和现代化的电信设备，因此我们不能在一切场合把应该迅速报道的重要新闻及时地报道出去。也就是说，我们还有些“水土不服”。
    这个“水土不服”的毛病是非解决不可的。当主观的思想作风与客观环境发生矛盾时，如果事实证明是前者落后于后者，那么我们就只有运用批评和自我批评的武器，改进我们的思想作风。要知道，我们这种思想作风的弱点，已经阻碍了我们工作的发展，使我们的工作不能满足读者的希望和要求，有时甚至造成政治上的严重损失，影响国家和人民的利益。曾经有过这样的事，某地发生了一个重要事件，在当时具有很大的政治意义，对于全国也有相当影响，许多读者都渴望知道这一事件。根据国家和人民利益的要求，也必须把它迅速地传播到全中国全世界去，以扩大它的政治影响。然而，当地的新闻工作者却迟迟不把这一事件准确迅速地报道出来，一直耽误了十几天之久，等到最后发表的时候，读者的兴趣和注意力已经降低，它的政治影响也大为减弱。试问，这是多大的政治损失，是何等对不起国家和人民，对于新闻记者来说，又是怎样的失职！因此，散漫、迟缓、时间观念不强，这不像有些人所了解的是小问题，是技术问题，而正如新华通讯社所指出的：“这不仅是技术问题，这是我们政治上不够敏锐，工作态度不够认真负责，在工作作风上疲蹋粗疏的结果。”
    更进一步地探求新闻报道所以迟缓的原因，除了思想作风方面的基本问题以外，尚有如下各点：
    （一）由于长期农村环境所养成的缓慢松弛作风，使我们对于即使是重要紧急的事件，也缺乏当天发稿的能力与习惯。
    （二）编辑、记者写稿，常常缺乏电报费和报纸篇幅观念，毫不节约字数，稿件冗长，译发费时。
    （三）有些报社、通讯社和机关、团体之间，缺乏密切联系。各地有些机关团体缺乏主动地及时地供给新闻的习惯，不善于利用报纸、通讯社、广播电台进行业务的宣传。而后者也不善于及时地从机关团体取得日常消息。这样，有些应该公开发表的新闻就不免遗漏或延误了。
    （四）在农村环境中形成的一套工作机构、工作制度和工作方法，在进入城市以后，没有进行适当的合理的改革，使之适应新的环境。编辑部门机构庞大，层次重叠，手续繁多，工作效率低，办事不能敏捷有效。
    （五）长期农村环境造成的不太注意争取时间的结果，使我们各个工作环节的工作人员——记者、编辑、译电人员、电务人员、校对及印刷工人普遍地缺乏准时完成工作的习惯。他们没有把自己的工作和新闻广播时间或报纸出版时间联系起来，不知道计算时间，也缺乏计时制度。
    因此，各地新闻机关为了克服报道迟缓，保证新闻及时发出，首先，必须在全体新闻工作人员中，普遍地进行加强时间观念的教育。这种时间观念的教育，不要单纯地孤立地进行，因为那样容易发生偏向；而应该与整个提高工作效率，加强政治责任心的政治教育联系起来进行。要使每个工作人员了解，时间不是抽象的东西，而是与我们的新闻文稿、报纸、广播相联系，有着具体的政治内容的。我们决不是为争取时间而争取时间，从单纯的技术观点出发争取时间，而是为了提高新闻的政治效果，为了对实际斗争能起更大的推动作用，而争取时间的。国家和人民的利益可以要求我们某些新闻慢些发布，但大多数新闻必须及时发布，并且越早发布越好。我们要使工作人员——首先是负责干部和编辑记者——了解，新闻工作人员必须具有政治头脑，必须时刻关心时事的、政治的和社会的变化、以便抓紧当前事变中的主要事件和问题，了解它的情况和意义，及时地组织报道。只有培养起这种政治上的敏感——这种敏感又是与高度的政治责任心不可分离的——才能不耽误主要工作，并区别工作中的主要、次要、轻重、缓急，有条理地来安排自己的工作。要使每个工作人员了解，新闻工作是一种严重的政治工作，它和人民的全般革命斗争息息相关，我们应该以严肃的态度来从事这种工作，而决不应该有马虎疲蹋，不负责任的现象。
    其次，记者、编辑和全体新闻工作人员都应该学会争取、利用和支配时间。新闻机关必须与其他工作机关、团体密切联系，了解每天和每一时期已经发生和可能发生的重要事件，以便有计划地组织新闻报道，安排报纸和电台的节目与篇幅，而不致临事慌乱。必须学会利用社会力量帮助采访新闻，以免事事都要由记者自己参加或从头参加到底，以致忙不过来。必须学会在采访当时就把主要事实和关节之处调查清楚，并即采即写，交给当事的负责人看过，立即送出，以免事后再去调查或找人审核。必须学会写作简短新闻的能力，以简练的文笔来概述重要而复杂的事件；特别是在时间紧迫的场合，能够先写简要的消息，尽早发出，然后再作详细的报道。必须学会善于安排工作程序和新闻节目，把紧急的重要的稿件首先处理发出或留置篇幅。必须学会利用电信、电话和其他便利的交通工具，来尽速传递新闻。
    再次，必须适当地调整和改善我们的机构和制度，使之更加适应城市环境，以便提高工作效率。新闻机关的组织宜简，层次宜少，尤其是处理新闻文稿的过程和手续应力求减缩。要使我们的组织简化到这样程度，就是记者编辑所写的重要与时间性强的稿件，能够直接送到社长、总编辑或编辑主任手中审核修改；在编写一般的稿件时，也能经常与新闻机关主要负责人保持密切联系。这样做法至少有三个好处，一是提高工作效能，缩短工作时间；二是领导人员和基本干部发生直接的工作关系，易于教育和提高记者编辑的采访写作水平，领导人员在业务上也不致疏旷；三是可以节省人力，使采访写作工作能有充足力量。凡是不适合于城市环境的制度应该废除或改变，必要的工作制度应该保持或建立。如稿件的登记、处理、收发、传递，必须有严格的制度，而且在通过每个环节时，都要计算时间，领导者要经常地抽查这种制度的执行情形，遇有紧急而又重要的新闻应该亲自监督发出。在我们全般的组织工作中，必须把时间的组织列为重要项目。
    但是，在我们提倡克服迟缓，争取及时报道的时候，又应该注意防止另一方面的偏向，这就是无原则的竞争时间。例如，不进行必要的调查研究，不问新闻是否真实准确，就胡乱发表。在思想上，把迅速和准确、真实相对立，认为时间第一，其他都可马虎。又例如，为着抢时间，而不照顾国家和人民利益，不问新闻是否合乎国家的纲领、政策和法令，也不管发表出去对于社会的影响怎样，听到一点消息，就随便出号外，发传单，耸人听闻。这种借口和做法都是不对的，不应该的。这是一种单纯技术观点，是旧式新闻记者的作风，是资产阶级新闻工作者的办法。这种为了抢时间、争读者，而不择手段，不顾社会影响的做法，在资本主义社会是不足为奇的，因为这正是由那个动荡不定的社会产生的。但是，在人民民主的社会中采取这种做法，就违反人民利益，不合乎新的道德标准，是不必要也不应该的事了。我们的新闻报道是为人民服务的，它应该对人民和国家负责，应该服从于人民和国家全般政治利益的要求。因此，我们的新闻首先就要真实准确，要合乎人民的利益和国家的政策，应该在这个基础上力求迅速，争取时间，做到尽早发布。我们所以要争取尽先发布某一新闻，目的无非是希望更有效地教育人民，更能发挥它的政治影响和推动实际工作，使它更加有利于人民的事业。如果新闻本身是不真实的，不合乎政策的，那么它不但不能起这种积极的作用，而且反会造成不好的结果，并破坏报纸、通讯社、广播电台自身的信用。因此，对新闻的时间性问题树立正确的观点，是完全必要的。
