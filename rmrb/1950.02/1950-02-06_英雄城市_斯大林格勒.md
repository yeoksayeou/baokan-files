　　Heroic City - Stalingrad
    The Soviet people will never forget this passage from Stalin:
    "...At Stalingrad, we fought the largest battle in history.
    "The result of the Battle of Stalingrad was the encirclement and annihilation of 300,000 German invaders, and the capture of one-third of them. ...We know that in the Battle of Stalingrad, 147,200 German soldiers and officers were discovered and buried, while 46,700 of our Soviet soldiers and officers heroically sacrificed their lives. The Battle of Stalingrad marked the beginning of the German fascist army's decline. It is now universally recognized that the German invaders never recovered after the Battle of Stalingrad."
    The Battle of Stalingrad was the turning point of World War II. Before that, the German war machine advanced triumphantly and unhindered, occupying many European countries, driving the British troops back to the British Isles, and invading most of Ukraine and Belarus. However, after the Battle of Stalingrad, the German war machine was blocked, and the Soviet and Allied forces began to turn to a favorable position.
    The Battle of Stalingrad lasted for half a year. In the autumn of 1942, the German invaders had reached the gates of Leningrad and were 120 kilometers from Moscow. In the south, the German invaders reached the outskirts of Stalingrad and the Caucasus Mountains. They greedily attempted to seize the Baku oil fields and outflank Moscow. They believed that cutting off the Soviet Union's supply of coal, metal, and food would lead to victory. However, under the wise leadership of the leader Stalin, the Soviet people established a powerful war industry in the east, and armaments were continuously supplied to the front lines. Because Stalin foresaw the German invaders' conspiracy, he thwarted the German invaders' fierce flames near Moscow. A new defense line from Moscow to Stalingrad had been firmly established. When the Hitler bandit gang attacked Stalingrad in the autumn of 1942, the Soviet Supreme Command ordered it to be defended at all costs.
    By November 9, the Soviet army launched a counter-offensive. The Soviet people gloriously completed Stalin's strategic instructions, defended the heroic city named after the people's leader, and at the appropriate time invested amazing strength to annihilate a large number of enemies in the counter-offensive. When the German commanders' two weak points were clamped down by the iron pincers of two Soviet armies, they requested Hitler to withdraw in time, but it was all too late. Not only were they forced into a trap in the Stalingrad area, but they also suffered a fatal blow in the central Don area. Thus, on February 2, all the German invaders in the Stalingrad area were annihilated.
    The German invaders wreaked the most havoc here. Post-war Stalingrad was a scene of craters and ruins. However, the people of the entire Soviet Union fully supported the reconstruction of this heroic city. Timber, building materials, and factory equipment were transported from all over the country. On the wall of a department store where the German Marshal Paulus was captured, a large slogan read:
    "We young people built Stalingrad;
    We young people defended this heroic city;
    We young people will rebuild it!"
    This is indeed the case. The vast majority of reconstruction workers are young men and women. The Communist Youth League launched members across the country to help with reconstruction. The speed and scope of the reconstruction work are astonishing. Within three years after the war, the population increased from 750 residents during the war to 300,000. Many enterprises, such as the tractor factory, the Red October Steel Plant, the machinery factory, the electric motor factory, and the food canning factory, have resumed work. Within three years, building construction reached 650,000 square meters. The railway connection station was restored, and navigation on the Volga River was restored and expanded. Within three years, 52 schools and many cultural buildings were built. The new five-year plan also plans to build two theaters, four hotels, four hospitals, thirty-seven nurseries, fifty-six schools, seven cinemas, and so on.
    Architectural experts such as Soviet Academy of Architecture Academician Karo Alabyan plan to build a new city along the Volga River, each place no more than three to four kilometers from the river. A large number of lawns will be built between the blocks. On Mamayev Kurgan, a central cultural and recreation park will be established. The future Stalingrad will be 50 kilometers long along the Volga River, which requires careful design in advance. Each block will be like a garden with lawns and flower beds. The air is fresh and suitable for living. Looking at Stalingrad from the boats on the Volga River, there will be scenery everywhere. A monument to the heroes who died in Stalingrad will be built on the banks of the Volga River, and a "Museum for the Defense of Stalingrad" will be built in the square in front of the monument.

### 英雄城市——斯大林格勒

　　英雄城市——斯大林格勒
    苏联人民永远也不会忘记斯大林说过的这一段话：
    “……在斯大林格勒我们打了历史上最大的一次战役。
    “斯大林格勒之战的结果是包围和歼灭了三十万德寇，并生俘其三分之一。……我们知道在斯城战役经发现并埋葬的德寇士兵及军官达十四万七千二百，而我们苏维埃士兵及军官也有四万六千七百名英勇牺牲了。斯大林格勒之战标志着德国法西斯军队开始走着下坡路。德寇自斯大林格勒之战后永远未能恢复，这已经是人所共认的了。”
    斯大林格勒之战是第二次世界大战的转折点。在此以前，德寇的战争机器很得意地推进无阻，它占领了欧洲许多国家，把英国兵赶回三岛去，它并且侵占了乌克兰、白俄罗斯的大部；然而斯大林格勒之战以后，德寇的战争机器受阻了，并使苏军和盟军开始转入了有利的地位。
    斯大林格勒之战延续达半年之久。一九四二年秋天时，德寇已薄列宁格勒大门，距莫斯科一百二十公里。在南线，德寇进抵斯城近郊及高加索山骊。它贪婪地企图占领巴库油田区并迂回莫斯科。它认为截断了苏联的煤、金属及食粮的供给便可取胜了。但是苏联人民在领袖斯大林的英明领导下，强大的战争工业在东部建立，军火源源供给前线。由于斯大林预见到德寇的阴谋，在莫斯科近郊阻遏了德寇的凶焰，自莫斯科迄斯大林格勒之新防线已坚强地建立起来。当一九四二年秋天希特勒匪帮进攻斯城时，苏维埃最高司令部即命令不惜一切代价防守它。
    至十一月九日，苏军进行反攻，苏维埃人民光荣地完成了斯大林的战略指示，保卫了以人民领袖命名的英雄城市，并在适当的时间内投入惊人的力量从反攻中歼灭了大量敌人。德寇司令官们在他们的两处弱点被两支苏军的铁钳夹击时，曾请求希特勒及时撤退，但这一切都太晚了。不仅在斯大林格勒区他们被迫进入了圈套，中部顿河区他们也受了致命的打击。这样，二月二日，全部斯大林格勒区的德寇覆灭了。
    德寇在这里破坏得最凶，斯大林格勒战后是一片弹坑与断垣。但是苏联全国人民全力支援这一英雄城市的重建工作。木材、建筑材料及工厂设备自各地运来。在德寇元帅鲍卢斯被俘处，一个百货商店的墙壁上，大字的标语这样写着：
    “我们青年人建立了斯大林格勒；
    我们青年人保卫了这一英雄城市；
    我们青年人还要重建它！”
    事实也是如此，重建工作者中绝大多数是青年男女。共产主义青年团在全国各地发动团员帮助重建。重建工作的速度与范围是惊人的。战后三年内，人口便从战时居民七百五十人增至三十万人。拖拉机工厂、红十月钢铁厂、机械厂、电动机制造厂、食品罐头工厂等许多企业都已经复工。三年内楼房建筑共达六十五万平方公尺。铁路连络站恢复了，伏尔加河上的航运恢复并扩大了。三年内兴建起来的计有：五十二所学校及许多文化建筑。新五年计划中还预备建筑二个剧院、四家大饭店、四所医院、三十七所托儿所、五十六所学校、七个影院等等。
    苏联建筑科学院院士卡罗·阿拉贝昂等建筑专家们计划沿伏尔加河建筑新城市，每一处距河皆不超出三至四公里。在街区之间将修建大量的草坪。在玛玛耶夫山上，一所中央文化与休息公园将要建立。未来的斯大林格勒沿着伏尔加河将长达五十公里，这就需要事先缜密设计，每一街区都像花园一样有草地花圃，空气新鲜宜于居住，自伏尔加河里船上看斯大林格勒将无处不是风景区。斯城死难英雄的纪念碑将在伏尔加河畔建立，在纪念碑前面的广场中将建立一座“保卫斯大林格勒博物馆”。（本报时事组）
