Xinhua News Agency, Hankou, February 2nd: The Central Plains Provisional People's Government recently issued instructions on supporting the army during the Spring Festival and a decision to strengthen preferential treatment for revolutionary military families during the Spring Festival. It calls on governments at all levels to comprehensively launch a movement to support the army and carry out work to provide preferential treatment to revolutionary military families. The instructions stipulate that governments at all levels should extensively distribute Spring Festival letters of sympathy and greetings to the families of revolutionary martyrs and military personnel, initiate a "one letter" campaign among cadres and public employees in government agencies and institutions, and, where possible, present books and newspapers and other items to the wounded and sick soldiers and veterans. In areas where troops are concentrated for rest and recuperation, areas where wounded and sick soldiers and veterans are recuperating, and old revolutionary base areas, support-the-army meetings should be held, and the masses should be mobilized to visit troops, veteran schools, and hospitals. Various localities can combine Spring Festival entertainment activities with joint army-civilian gatherings or evening parties. Government agencies can hold symposiums for veterans, families of revolutionary martyrs, and military families to help them formulate production plans. For families of revolutionary martyrs and military personnel in the old revolutionary base areas who are without support, efforts should be made to provide them with spiritual comfort and solve their living problems, and to help them with production in various ways. After the Spring Festival, their children should be helped to enroll in schools where possible.
