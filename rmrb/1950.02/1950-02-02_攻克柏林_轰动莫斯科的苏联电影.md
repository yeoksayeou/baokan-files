　　The Soviet film "The Fall of Berlin" (in two parts, color), a monumental work that narrates the heroic achievements of the Soviet people in crushing Hitler's Germany and rescuing the peoples of Europe from the terrors of fascist enslavement, was shown in Moscow on the 21st. When Stalin, played by Gelovani, appeared on the screen, the audience erupted in thunderous applause. The film shows the inseparable connection between the leader and the people, and the friendship and unity of the Soviet working people. Mikhail Chiaureli, a People's Artist of the USSR, the producer and one of the screenwriters of the film, said: "Both parts of the film were completed within a year. The film crew strived to express the historical authenticity of this great event and the atmosphere it represented. They thoroughly studied a large amount of documentary material. They gained greatly from meetings and conversations with the heroes of the Great Patriotic War, especially those who participated in the attack on Berlin. The filming was carried out on a scale unprecedented in the world of cinema. Some mass scenes involved tens of thousands of people. All the war scenes were filmed on historical battlefields. The participation of soldiers and officers of the Soviet army in the performances provided invaluable assistance in creating a realistic war atmosphere. Huge backdrops were created for some episodes, and experts did a great deal of work in special effects photography and other aspects. We approached the filming of the scenes of the Supreme Command with a high sense of responsibility. We strived to realistically and vividly depict the atmosphere in which Stalin worked during the Great Patriotic War."

　　The newly filmed color film "The Fall of Berlin" has created a great sensation in Moscow. On January 21st, the first day of the film's screening, the audience reached 150,000, and every show has been sold out since its opening. The plot of the film describes the struggle of the Soviet people in the Great Patriotic War and Stalin's brilliant strategic and command abilities.
　　Moscow newspapers pointed out that "The Fall of Berlin" is an outstanding production among Soviet films. People's Artist of the USSR Vsevolod Pudovkin wrote in the Soviet Art Newspaper: "The film is a prominent event in Soviet film life, Soviet culture, and the social and political life of the Soviet people. Pudovkin emphasized that the film is an example of the ideological and artistic progress of Soviet film art, which is increasingly successfully mastering the method of socialist realism. This film is popular because of its authenticity and mass appeal, and the audience can find characters in this film that resemble their own characteristics and emotions. The main tone and theme of the film are the unity of the people and the leader, the people's heartfelt love for Stalin, and their loyalty to the great cause of communism."
　　Alexander Stein wrote in the Literary Gazette: "The spiritual world of the heroes in the Soviet people in 'The Fall of Berlin' is rich, diverse, beautiful, and pure. Hitler and his lackeys, on the other hand, are so vile, depraved, and disgusting. The film does not depict all their ugliness and filth in bizarre forms, and it is precisely for this reason that it powerfully demonstrates Hitler's inferiority, his adventurism, and his moral degradation."
　　Writer Vishnevsky wrote in Culture and Life newspaper: The film is permeated with a profound Party spirit, and the performances are natural and realistic, making the audience feel that everything in the film is very intimate and moving. The film also positively expresses the great desire of the Soviet people for peace.

　　“攻克柏林”轰动莫斯科的苏联电影
    彩色艺术新片“攻克柏林”（上下集）已于二十一日在莫斯科放映。苏联电影的这一部纪念碑式的片子，叙说苏联人民的英雄业迹，他们粉碎希特勒德国并从法西斯奴役的恐怖中拯救欧洲各民族人民。由基洛瓦尼扮演的斯大林一出现在银幕时，观众即发出暴风雨般的掌声。影片显示了领袖与人民的不可分割的联系，苏联劳动人民的友好与团结。本片的制片者和电影脚本作者之一的苏联人民艺术家米哈依尔·契奥列利说：“影片的上下集均在一年内完成。影片工作人员力求表达出这一巨大事件及其所表现的气氛的历史真实性。他们彻底地研究了大量的纪录性的材料。而在与伟大爱国战争的英雄、特别是与那些曾参加进攻柏林的人们的会晤和谈话中，收获极大。摄制工作是以世界电影界空前的规模来进行的。某些群众场面有上万的人参加。所有的战争场面都是在历史性的战场上摄制的。苏军的兵士和军官的参加演出，在创造逼真的战争气氛上给予了无可估价的帮助。为某些插曲创设了巨大的背景，专家在特别场面的摄影等方面作了许许多多的工作。我们以高度责任感来对待摄制最高统帅部的场面。我们力求真实地和逼真地描写在伟大爱国战争时期斯大林进行工作的那种气氛。”

    新摄成的彩色影片“攻克柏林”大大地轰动了莫斯科。一月二十一日，该片放映的第一日，观众达十五万人，开映以来场场客满。该片的情节是描述苏联人民在伟大爱国战争中所进行的斗争，及斯大林英明的战略及指挥才能。
    莫斯科各报指出：“攻克柏林”是苏联影片中卓越的出品。苏联人民艺术家蒲多夫金在苏联艺术报上写道：“该片是苏联电影生活、苏联文化以及苏联人民社会和政治生活中的突出事件。蒲多夫金着重指出：该片是苏联电影艺术在思想和艺术上进步的一个范例，而苏联电影艺术正在日益成功地掌握着社会主义的现实主义的方法。这部影片因其真实性、群众性而受人欢迎，观众在此片中可以找出与他们自己的特性及情感相似的人物。片子的主调和主题是人民与领袖的团结，人民对于斯大林由衷的爱戴，以及他们对于共产主义伟大事业的忠诚。”
    亚历山大·斯泰因在文学报上写道：“苏联人民——‘攻克柏林’片中的英雄的精神世界是丰富、多样性、美好而纯洁的。希特勒和他的从仆，却是那样的卑贱、堕落而惹人厌恶。片中并未以怪异的体态来描绘出他们一切的丑恶与污浊，正因为这个原因，却能强有力地将希特勒品质的低劣，他的冒险主义及道义的沦丧充分表现出来。”
    作家维什涅夫斯基在文化与生活报上写道：片中贯穿着深刻的党的精神，表演自然而真实，使观众感觉片中一切都十分亲切动人。该片并肯定地表达出苏联人民对和平的伟大愿望。
