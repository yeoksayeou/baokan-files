Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 11th. Japanese steelworkers at the Yawata factory of the Japan Iron & Steel Company, who began striking on the 2nd of this month due to the breakdown of collective bargaining negotiations, have gained the support of workers at other factories of the company. According to a Reuters Tokyo dispatch, after the Central Committee of the Japan Iron & Steel Workers' Union issued instructions for sympathy strikes to seven local unions, workers at the Hokkaido Rinnai factory of the Japan Iron & Steel Company began an indefinite strike on the 8th. Union members at the Kamaishi factory in northern Honshu decided to leave work several hours early. Meanwhile, fourteen national Japanese trade unions held a meeting in Tokyo on the 8th and drafted a statement in support of the steelworkers.

Negotiations between labor and management at the Yawata factory, which had been briefly resumed on the 8th, broke down again. Reuters reported that as a result of the strike, the production of milling iron alone has fallen to 60 percent of its daily output.

　　日钢铁工人罢工扩大
    铣铁产量减少百分之四十
    【新华社北京十一日电】因集体议价谈判破裂而于本月二日开始罢工的日本钢铁公司八幡工厂工人，已获得该公司其他工厂工人的支持。据路透社东京消息，日本钢铁工人工会中央委员会在向七个地方工会发出同情罢工的指示后，日本钢铁公司的北海道轮西工厂工人于八日开始无限期罢工。本州北部釜石工厂的工会会员决定提早数小时下工。同时，十四个日本全国性的工会，八日在东京举行会议，并草拟支援钢铁工人的声明。
    八幡工厂劳资双方曾于八日一度恢复集体议价的谈判，旋即再告破裂。路透社称：罢工的结果，仅铣铁一项的产量，已降至日常产量的百分之六十。
