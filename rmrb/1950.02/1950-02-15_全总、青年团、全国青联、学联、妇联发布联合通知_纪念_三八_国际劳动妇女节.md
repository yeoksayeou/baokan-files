The All-China Federation of Trade Unions, the Central Committee of the China New Democratic Youth League, the All-China Youth Federation, the All-China Students' Federation, and the All-China Democratic Women's Federation issued a joint notice on the 13th of this month regarding the commemoration of "March 8th" International Working Women's Day. The original text is as follows:

This year, the significance of Chinese women commemorating "March 8th" International Working Women's Day is far greater than in any previous year. The Chinese revolution has achieved unprecedented and great victories nationwide, sweeping away the Kuomintang bandit gangs on the Chinese mainland. The People's Republic of China has been established and has received warm support from the entire Chinese people and overseas Chinese, as well as the sincere welcome of peace-loving and democratic people around the world. Chinese women have been liberated from a state of oppression and enslavement and have become masters of the new China. The political, economic, and social status of women has also been greatly improved, and the Common Program clearly stipulates the protection of women's rights. Internationally, the world peace and democracy camp, led by the Soviet Union, is unprecedentedly strong, and the revolutionary struggles of the people in colonies and dependent countries are developing on a large scale. Consequently, the international democratic women's movement and the Asian women's national democratic movement are also moving forward. When commemorating "March 8th," mass organizations in various regions must explain the great significance of this victory to the broad masses of women and further point out the significant responsibilities of women in the new China. At present, the People's Liberation War has not yet completely ended. The Chinese people must support the People's Liberation Army with great strength to liberate the entire territory, heal the wounds of war, overcome financial and economic difficulties, and enable the new China to transition to production and construction. Our women must continue to support the People's Liberation Army, strive to participate in industrial, agricultural, and sideline production, actively carry out anti-bandit, anti-hegemony, and rent reduction work, and prepare for land reform. Strengthen the unity of women from all strata in the country, strengthen the unity with international working women and all peace-loving and democratic women, and greet this year's "March 8th" with these practical actions. Actively participating in production is the central link in all of the above work.

Female workers should unite with male workers, work hard to produce, focus on machinery, learn technology, actively join trade union organizations, respond to all the calls of the trade union, enthusiastically participate in various production and conservation movements, and strive to restore and develop industrial production. Rural women should actively participate in agricultural and sideline production, learn production techniques, further exert and improve their role in production, and work with farmers to strive to increase grain production by 10 billion catties and cotton production by 4.7 million dan. At present, they should concentrate their efforts on preparing for and participating in spring plowing. Women in disaster areas should do everything possible to participate in various kinds of production, overcome disasters, and implement the policy of self-reliance through production. Urban and rural housewives should all learn to work and participate in appropriate production endeavors, transforming themselves from consumers into producers.

Intellectual women—female students and women in various professions—when commemorating "March 8th" this year, should thoroughly transform their thinking, cultivate and strengthen the view that labor is glorious, establish and consolidate the idea of serving the working people, and learn and improve their ability to serve the working people. Female students should work hard to study culture, science, and Marxism-Leninism Mao Zedong Thought for the construction of a new democratic China; and correct their individualistic learning attitudes. Professional women should engage in their professions with a new attitude, settle down to work, study their professions, strengthen work efficiency, improve professional skills, and correct the employment view and irresponsible work attitude.

For the above purposes, we propose the following four methods for carrying out the "March 8th" commemoration.

(1) Before and on "March 8th," mass organizations in various regions should appropriately organize commemorative meetings, symposiums, etc. among women, and, based on the central meaning of this notice and the "Brief History of March 8th International Working Women's Day" published by Xinhua News Agency, combined with the actual situation of the local women, conduct discussions to enable women to have a clear understanding of the current situation and the significance and tasks of commemorating "March 8th" International Working Women's Day this year.

As for the form and scale of the commemorative meeting, it can be adapted to local conditions, with the principle of being able to deeply promote and mobilize the "March 8th" spirit, save manpower and material resources, and not hinder production, learning, and work. Generally speaking, cities liberated before "March 8th" last year should hold small commemorative meetings or symposiums in factories, schools, and organs. Cities liberated after "March 8th" last year should convene larger-scale mass commemorative meetings that can be held locally. In rural areas, commemoration should be carried out in appropriate ways.

(2) According to the situation of local production recovery and development and the degree of awareness of working women, in areas where conditions are ripe, labor heroes, models, and outstanding individuals in various production undertakings, models and activists in protecting factories, can be appropriately commended and rewarded.

(3) In areas where the resolutions of the Asian Women's Representative Conference held last winter have not yet been conveyed, a brief conveyance can be carried out at the "March 8th" commemorative meeting to strengthen internationalist education.

(4) In order to strengthen and expand the connection with women, trade unions, peasant associations, youth leagues, youth federations, and student unions at all levels should first strengthen the regular contact between the organizations so that they can cooperate and divide the work to further develop the women's liberation movement and the mass movement. Therefore, when commemorating "March 8th" this year, women's federations, trade unions, peasant associations, new democratic youth leagues, youth federations, and student unions in urban and rural areas should consult together, organize preparatory committees, and carry out preparatory work. In this regard, the women's federations in various regions should adopt a positive and proactive policy and steps, and the workers', peasants', and youth organizations should also enthusiastically and closely cooperate, and strengthen the women's work of their own organizations and expand the mass base of their own organizations through the work of commemorating "March 8th". Make the commemoration of "March 8th" a broader and deeper mass movement.

　　全总、青年团、全国青联、学联、妇联发布联合通知
    纪念“三八”国际劳动妇女节
    【本报讯】中华全国总工会、中国新民主主义青年团中央委员会、中华全国民主青年联合总会、中华全国学生联合会、中华全国民主妇女联合会于本月十三日发布关于纪念“三八”国际劳动妇女节的联合通知，原文如下：
    今年，中国妇女纪念“三八”国际劳动妇女节，其意义之重大，远胜于过去任何一年。中国革命已经在全国范围内取得了空前未有的伟大胜利，扫除了中国大陆上的国民党匪帮，中华人民共和国已经成立，而且受到了全中国人民及海外华侨的热烈拥护，全世界爱好和平民主的人民的竭诚欢迎。中国妇女已经从被压迫被奴役的状态中解放出来，成为新中国的主人翁，妇女的政治、经济、社会地位也有大大的提高，共同纲领上明文规定了保障妇女权利。在国际上，以苏联为首的世界和平民主阵营空前的强大，殖民地与附属国人民的革命斗争大规模的开展；随之而来的，国际民主妇女运动和亚洲妇女民族民主运动也正在向前发展。各地群众团体在纪念“三八”节的时候，必须向广大妇女群众说明这种胜利的伟大意义，并进而指出新中国的新妇女的重大责任。目前人民解放战争尚未完全结束，中国人民要以很大的力量支援人民解放军，解放全部国土，医治战争创伤，克服财政经济困难，使新中国转入生产建设；我们妇女必须继续支援人民解放军，努力参加工业、农业、副业生产，积极开展反匪、反霸、减租以及准备土地改革的工作。加强国内各阶层妇女的团结，加强和国际劳动妇女与一切爱好和平民主的妇女的团结，以这些实际行动来迎接今年的“三八”节；而积极参加生产，尤为以上一切工作的中心环节。
    女工们要和男工团结一致，努力生产，面向机器，学习技术，积极加入工会组织，响应工会的一切号召，热烈参加各种生产节约运动，为恢复和发展工业生产而奋斗。农村妇女要积极参加农业和副业生产，学习生产技术，更加发挥和提高自己在生产中的作用，与农民一起为增产粮食一百亿斤，棉花四百七十万担而奋斗；在目前更要集中力量准备并参加春耕生产。灾区的妇女尤应尽一切力量参加各种各样的生产，渡过灾荒，贯彻生产自救的方针。城、乡的家庭妇女都要学习劳动，参加适当的生产事业，变消费者为生产者。
    知识妇女——女学生及各种职业妇女们，在今年纪念“三八”节的时候，要彻底改造思想，培养和加强以劳动为光荣的观点，建立和巩固为劳动人民服务的思想，学习并提高为劳动人民服务的本领。女学生更要为建设新民主主义新中国而努力学习文化，学习科学，学习马列主义毛泽东思想；纠正个人主义的学习态度。职业妇女应该以新的态度从事职业，安心工作，钻研业务，加强工作效率，提高业务技能，纠正雇佣观点及不负责任的工作态度。
    为了上述目的，我们提议按照以下四项办法来进行“三八”节的纪念。
    （一）在“三八”节以前和当日，各地群众团体应在妇女群众中适当地组织纪念会、座谈会等，根据本通知的中心意义及新华社发布的“三八”国际劳动妇女节简史，结合当时当地妇女群众的实际情况，进行讨论，使妇女群众对目前时局与今年纪念“三八”国际劳动妇女节的意义和任务有明确的认识。
    至于纪念会的形式和规模，可以因地制宜，以能深入“三八”节的宣传动员与节省人力物力，不妨碍生产学习和工作为原则。一般来说，去年“三八”节前解放的城市，则以在工厂、学校、机关举行小型纪念会或座谈会为宜，去年“三八”节后解放的城市，召开当地可能举行的较大规模的群众性纪念会。农村则以适当的方式进行纪念。
    （二）根据当地生产恢复与发展的情况和劳动妇女觉悟的程度，在条件已经成熟的地区，可以适当的表扬和奖励各种生产事业中的劳动英雄、模范和优秀分子，护厂的模范和积极分子。
    （三）在尚未传达去冬亚洲妇女代表会议的决议的地区，可以在“三八”节纪念会上，进行简要的传达，以加强国际主义的教育。
    （四）工、农、青、妇各群众团体，为了加强与扩大对妇女群众的联系，首先应加强各团体之间的经常联系，以便互相配合，分工合作，更进一步开展妇女解放运动及群众运动。因此今年纪念“三八”节的时候，各城乡妇女联合会、工会、农会、新民主主义青年团、青年联合会、学生联合会应共同协商，组织筹备会，进行筹备工作。在这一方面，各地妇联应采取积极的主动的方针和步骤，而工人、农民、青年的团体，亦应热烈地密切地配合，并通过纪念“三八”节的工作，来加强本团体的妇女工作，扩大本团体的群众基础。使“三八”节的纪念，成为更广泛和深入的群众运动。
