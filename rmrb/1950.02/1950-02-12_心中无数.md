　　Completely Clueless
    Lu Gong
    You furrow your brow and take a drag on your cigarette,
    Then look again at the plan on your desk:
    2, 4, 6, 7 are numbers,
    5, 6, 8, 3 cause a headache….
    You have half a textbook of doctrines in your head,
    And can produce some work experience,
    But you shake your head when you encounter numbers,
    Take a drag on your cigarette and check the time.
    The clock on the wall says almost five,
    Soon it will be quitting time, and the day is done,
    What to do with the statistical numbers?
    Just add up 1, 2, 3, 4.
    Have you forgotten what you are doing?
    How can you just fill it in haphazardly?
    Numbers are most important in economic work,
    Even the decimal point can't be off by a bit.

　　心中无数
    路工
    你皱皱眉头吸枝烟，
    再把办公桌上计划书看一遍：
    ２．４．６．７数目字，
    ５．６．８．３头痛开……。
    你肚内教条有半篇，
    工作经验也能拿出点，
    就是遇到数字摇脑袋，
    吸吸烟来看时间。
    墙上挂钟快五点，
    马上下班一天完，
    数字统计怎么办？
    １、２、３、４凑起来。
    你好像忘了干什么？
    怎能凑合填一填？
    经济工作数字最重要，
    小数点也不能错一点。
