　　State-Owned Factories and Mines in Xuanhua City
    Exceed January Production Plans
    Savings Develop into Mass Movement
    [Reported by this newspaper] The state-owned factories and mines in Xuanhua generally exceeded their planned production targets in January. At the same time, thrift and savings have developed into a mass movement, achieving great results. The vast number of workers and staff in the city's ten state-owned factories and mines launched a widespread production and economy drive in January. The Xiahuayuan Power Plant saved over 361,000 jin of millet in expenses in January. Major projects at the plant, such as the repair of the cooling spray pond, were originally scheduled to take two months to complete, but were completed in just forty days thanks to the round-the-clock efforts of the workers. The Xuanhua Paper Mill completed its January production plan in twenty days, and began trial production of newsprint on January 22. Boiler workers at the mill, in response to the call for thrift and savings, diligently studied their work and reduced coal consumption from 13 tons to 8 tons by January 15, and later to 7 tons, while also increasing the pressure by 100%. To maintain and extend the life of the boilers, workers suggested returning used water to the original furnace for recycling, as this water does not contain alkali and is less harmful to the boilers. The Yantongshan Mine produced 15,246 tons of ore in January, exceeding the original plan by 943 tons, and the past phenomenon of workers absenting themselves from work without reason has been overcome. Wang Deheng, the director of the Oxygen Plant, after painstaking research and experimentation, successfully developed oxygen explosives, which cost five times less than ammonium nitrate explosives and have a strong explosive power, which can be supplied to Yantongshan for mining purposes in large quantities, greatly reducing the cost of ore at Yantongshan in the future. With the exception of a few mines and factories that did not complete their production tasks due to untimely supply of raw materials, all other factories completed or exceeded their January production plans. In order to complete the first quarter's production tasks and welcome the major merit evaluation at the end of March, some factories and mines have now launched a competition to increase output, improve quality, reduce costs, and save raw materials and fuel. Pangjiabao has launched a red flag competition to complete the first quarter's construction tasks. However, there are still some shortcomings in individual factories. First of all, the leadership of the Party, the administration, and the trade union cannot keep up with the needs of the current movement, and their understanding of the principle of concentrating efforts to improve production is insufficient. In addition, bureaucratic work styles still remain, affecting in-depth study and unfamiliarity with production operations. Secondly, there is a lack of a certain reward and punishment system. Although some factories already have regulations, their implementation is still poor, thus affecting the workers' enthusiasm and creativity. In order to consolidate the existing achievements in production and savings and the workers' enthusiasm for production, the above shortcomings must be overcome.

　　宣化市各国营工厂矿山
    一月生产超过计划
    节约形成群众性运动
    【本报讯】宣化各国营工厂矿山，一月份大部超过计划完成生产任务。同时，节约已形成群众性运动，获得很大成绩。该市十个国营工厂矿山的广大职工，在一月份普遍掀起生产节约运动。下花园发电厂一月份节省开支三十六万一千余斤小米。该厂主要工程如冷却喷水池的修复，原计划两个月完工，经过职工们昼夜抢修，四十天即完成任务。宣化造纸厂二十天完成一月份生产计划，于一月二十二日已开始试车出白报纸。该厂锅炉工友为响应节约号召，努力钻研业务，于一月十五日由原烧煤十三吨，减到八吨，后又减到七吨，并增加了一倍的气压。为保持和延长锅炉的寿命，工人建议把用过之水排回原炉，循环使用，这种水不含碱质，对锅炉损害小。烟筒山矿场一月份产矿砂一万五千二百四十六吨，超过原计划九百四十三吨，过去曾有过的工人无故旷工现象已克服了。氧气厂厂长王德恒经过苦心钻研试制氧气炸药成功，成本较硝氨炸药减低五倍，且爆炸威力甚强，可大量供烟筒山采矿使用，今后烟筒山的矿砂成本也将大大减低。该区除个别矿厂，因原料供应不及时没完成生产任务外，其他各厂都完成和超过一月份生产计划。为完成第一季生产任务，迎接三月底大评功，有些厂矿现已展开增加产量，提高质量，减低成本，节省原料燃料的竞赛运动。庞家堡为完成第一季的修建任务，展开了夺红旗运动。但目前有个别厂还存在一些缺点，首先是党、行政、工会的领导赶不上当前运动的需要，对集中力量搞好生产的原则认识不足，加上官僚主义作风还有残存，影响深入学习，对生产业务不熟悉。其次是缺乏一定的赏罚制度，虽然有的厂已有规定，但执行尚差，因而影响了工人的积极性和创造性。为巩固既得的生产节约成绩和工人的生产热情，上述缺点是必须克服的。
