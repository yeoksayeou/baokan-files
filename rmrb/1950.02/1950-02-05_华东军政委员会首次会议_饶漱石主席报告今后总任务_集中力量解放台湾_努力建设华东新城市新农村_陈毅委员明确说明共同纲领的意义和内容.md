Sixty-three members attended, thirty-eight people attended as observers, and sixty-eight guests were present.

In his report, Chairman Rao analyzed the current basic objective situation in East China and the basic characteristics of the economy in the new areas, and proposed that the general task of the East China Military and Political Committee's future work "should be to concentrate all efforts to resolutely eliminate the remaining enemies within, and to fight for the liberation of Taiwan and the completion of the task of liberating the whole country; it should be to transform the many old cities in East China, which used to serve imperialism and bureaucratic capitalism and depend on the imperialist economy for survival and deformed development, into new cities that serve domestic production and the people, and are truly sound and prosperous; it should be to transform the feudal, impoverished, and backward old rural areas in the vast new areas into democratic, prosperous, and progressive new rural areas; it should be to widely expand the construction of people's democratic power, and to fight for the construction of a new East China." In his report, Commissioner Chen Yi gave a general and clear explanation of the emergence and great significance of the Common Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and the basic content of the Common Program. He also stated: "I believe that the report on the work tasks for 1950 presented by Chairman Rao Shushi at this meeting is completely correct, conforms to the principles of the Common Program, and is precisely the concrete implementation of the spirit and principles of the Common Program in East China. After this report is adopted by this meeting, it will become the basis for the efforts of the people of East China, and I am confident that the people of East China will achieve new and great victories in 1950."

    Vice Chairman Su Yu Reports on the Current Military Situation in East China

    In his report, Vice Chairman Su Yu explained that the East China People's Liberation Army had eliminated a total of 2.1 million Kuomintang troops in the past three years, completely liberating the mainland of East China, and in the past six months, had eliminated more than 64,000 Kuomintang bandits and secret service forces, basically eliminating or currently eliminating bandit gangs. Currently, there are approximately 230,000 Kuomintang regular troops remaining distributed in Taiwan and the islands along the southeast coast (plus special forces and local troops, totaling approximately 300,000). Vice Chairman Su pointed out: The battle to liberate the islands along the southeast coast and Taiwan is the task of the East China People's Liberation Army, and it is also the task of all the people of East China. This combat mission is extremely arduous, it is a modern-style operation, requiring a large supply of manpower, material resources, financial resources, and weapons, and requiring excellent technical guidance. However, "as long as the people can provide us with a sufficient supply of combat materials and good technical equipment, under the wise leadership of Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu, we can guarantee that the East China People's Liberation Army will definitely be able to complete the great task of liberating the islands along the southeast coast and Taiwan in the near future, in order to cooperate with the fraternal field armies throughout the country to complete the glorious task of liberating all of China."

    Vice Chairman Zeng Shan Reports on Nine Tasks of Financial and Economic Work

    In his report, Vice Chairman Zeng Shan put forward nine specific tasks for East China's financial and economic work in 1950. Among them, the first and most urgent task is, under the unified deployment of the Central People's Government, to prepare to mobilize all manpower, material resources, and financial resources to support the war to liberate Taiwan and other islands, in order to ensure the complete victory of the war. The second task is to ensure the completion of the public grain and tax tasks assigned to East China by the Central Government, as well as the sales task of 45 million shares of public bonds. Vice Chairman Zeng said: East China's financial and economic tasks this year are very heavy, and there are still many difficulties, but difficulties can be overcome, so the future is hopeful and bright.

    Commissioner Shu Tong Calls for Building a New Culture and New Education

    In his report, Commissioner Shu Tong first pointed out: "The East China region, especially the Jiangnan region centered on Shanghai, is a region with relatively developed culture and education and excellent revolutionary traditions, but at the same time, it has been the arena for imperialist cultural aggression for more than a hundred years and the solid stronghold of the Kuomintang's reactionary rule for more than twenty years." Then, Commissioner Shu gave a detailed explanation of the current cultural and educational work in East China, and put forward the basic principles and tasks of cultural, educational, and health work in East China in the future. Finally, he said: East China's culture and education are in a very important position in the country, the same as its position in national defense and economy. Therefore, the responsibilities we shoulder are particularly important. We must consolidate and expand the anti-imperialist and anti-feudal united front in culture and education, unite all progressive and democratic forces, and build East China's new culture and new education in a planned and step-by-step manner, according to possibility and need.
