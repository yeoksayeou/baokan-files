　　Suihua County Cooperative Purchases Large Quantity of Seeds to Help Farmers with Spring Planting
    [This Newspaper's Report] The Suihua County Cooperative is helping farmers prepare wheat seeds for spring planting. The county plans to plant 19,800 hectares of wheat this year (compared to 16,000 hectares planted last year). However, in addition to exchanging some seeds within the county, there is still a shortage of over 1.5 million jin of wheat seeds. To solve the farmers' seed shortage, the County Cooperative has obtained a loan of 3 billion Northeast currency from the Northeast Bank and purchased 1.13 million jin of high-quality wheat seeds (including the Soviet "Kahua" variety) and 240,000 jin of soybean seeds ("Man Cang Jin") from Jiamusi, Shuangcheng and other counties. These seeds are enough for planting over 5,000 hectares of wheat and over 2,000 hectares of soybeans. The cooperative is still continuing to purchase seeds. To accelerate capital turnover and purchase more seeds, the County Cooperative has also signed contracts with nine district cooperatives to exchange grain for seeds. The contracts stipulate that the seeds are priced at the purchase price plus various expenses, while the farmers' grain is converted at the local market price, ensuring that neither party suffers a loss.

　　绥化县联社购买大量种子  帮助农民春播
    【本报讯】绥化县联社帮助农民准备小麦种子进行春播。该县今年计划种小麦一万九千八百垧（去年种一万六千垧）；但麦种除在本县串换一部外，尚缺一百五十多万斤。县联社为了解决农民缺种困难，已从东北银行贷款三十亿元（东北币），从佳木斯、双城等县买到优良麦种（包括苏联“克华种”）一百一十三万斤，及豆种（满仓金）廿四万斤，可供五千多垧小麦和二千多垧大豆播种之用，现仍在继续收购中。县联社为了加速资金周转，多买籽种，又和九个区社订了用粮换种的合同。规定种子按买价及各种花销作价，农民粮食按当地市价折合互换，两不吃亏。
