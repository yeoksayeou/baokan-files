　　A Weapon for the Struggle for Human Liberation
    ——Written for the Soviet Film Exhibition——
    The Soviet film exhibition, which begins on February 10th in Beijing, Tianjin, Shenyang, Shanghai... and other places, will screen thirty-eight films. This almost includes the most important works of Soviet cinema in the last ten years, representing the highest achievements of Soviet film art. For Chinese audiences, this is an unprecedented and impossible opportunity to appreciate Soviet films and learn from the Soviet Union.
    Soviet cinema has been leaping forward for thirty years. Starting with "Chapaev," it laid a solid foundation; since then, it has continuously improved and achieved even greater success. The productions of 1947 and 1948, such as "The Third Strike," "The Young Guard," "Siberian Symphony," "Michurin," "Pavlov," "Resurrection," "A Real Man," and "The Great Turning Point," are all immortal works. Documentaries such as "New Albania," "May Day Parade," and "The Life of Lenin" should be given the same evaluation.
    Soviet cinema not only widely, deeply, and vividly reflects modern life, but also reflects historical life. In historical films such as "Peter the Great," etc., and in biographical films such as "Admiral Nakhimov," "Suvorov," "Resurrection," "Pavlov," etc., historical subjects are treated from a scientific point of view, and the traditional spirit of loving the people and loving the motherland is promoted.
    Fairy tales and cartoons are also an important part. "The Stone Flower," "The Crystal Shoe," "The Golden Key," "The Magic Flute" and others all express the idea of labor creating the world. Their fans are not limited to teenagers and children.
    Although the themes and forms are different, Soviet films are created around such a general theme: reflecting the struggle of the people and the activeness and creativity embodied by the people in the struggle, full of a high degree of patriotism and internationalism.
    The wise leadership of Lenin, Stalin, and the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) has enabled Soviet filmmakers to have a clear direction from the very beginning, and to correct the deviations that have occurred in a timely manner. Inheriting the realistic tradition of Russian art for centuries, the creative method of socialist realism is implemented in screenwriting, directing, acting and other work. It not only creates typical characters in typical environments, but also infects us with a "good, developing, inspiring" (Lenin's words) power, and arms us with deep thoughts combined with high artistry. It is no exaggeration to say that Soviet film is one of the important weapons in the struggle for human liberation.

　　为人类解放而斗争的武器
    ——为苏联影片展览而作——
    从二月十日开始在北京、天津、沈阳、上海……等地举行的苏联影片展览，将映出三十八部影片。这差不多包括了苏联电影最近十年的重要作品，代表了苏联电影艺术的最高成就。对于中国观众说，这乃是一个前所未有也不可能有的欣赏苏联电影及学习苏联的机会。
    三十年来苏联电影是飞跃进步着。从“却帕也夫”（即“夏伯阳”）起，它就奠定了结实的基础；此后，更不断地提高，而有了更高的成就。一九四七、一九四八年的出品，如《第三次打击》、《青年近卫军》、《西伯利亚交响乐》、《米邱林》、《巴夫洛夫》、《起死回生》、《真正的人》和《大转变》等等，都是不朽的作品。纪录片如《新的阿尔巴尼亚》、《五一大检阅》和《列宁的生平》等等，也该给与同等的评价。
    苏联电影不仅广泛地、深刻地、生动地反映了现代生活，同时也反映了历史生活。在历史片如《彼得大帝》等等中，在传记片如《海军大将》、《苏瓦洛夫》、《起死回生》、《巴夫洛夫》等等中，用科学的观点处理了历史题材，发扬了爱人民与爱祖国的传统精神。
    童话片和卡通片也是重要的一部分。《宝石花》、《水晶鞋》、《金钥匙》、《神笛宝盒》等等，都表现了劳动创造世界的思想。它们的爱好者实不限于少年与儿童。
    题材与形式虽然不同，苏联电影是环绕着这样一个总的主题来创作的：反映人民的斗争和人民在斗争中体现的积极性与创造性，洋溢着高度的爱国主义与国际主义的精神。
    列宁、斯大林和联共（布）党的英明领导，使苏联电影工作者从一开始就有着一个明确的方向，并得及时地纠正了曾经发生过的偏向。承继了几世纪以来俄罗斯艺术的现实主义的传统，使社会主义的现实主义的创作方法贯彻于编剧、导演、表演及其他工作之中。不仅创造了典型环境中的典型人物，而且，以一种“好的、发展人的、鼓舞人的”（列宁语）力量，感染着我们，以结合着高度艺术性的深刻的思想性武装着我们。毫不夸张地说，苏联电影是为人类解放而斗争的重要武器之一。
