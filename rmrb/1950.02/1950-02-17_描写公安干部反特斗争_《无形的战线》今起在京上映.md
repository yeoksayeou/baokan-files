The film depicts the anti-bandit and anti-espionage struggle of the public security cadres of the People's Government. After the armed forces of the Chiang bandits were annihilated, the remaining bandits and spies lurked in the liberated areas, taking advantage of the 麻痹 [complacency] and negligence of some staff members, and forcing coerced elements to infiltrate our factories to carry out sabotage. Through investigation and research relying on the masses by our public security cadres, and through education of the coerced elements, the bandit and spy organization was finally uncovered, and the ringleader of the spies was brought to justice by the people.

　　描写公安干部反特斗争  《无形的战线》今起在京上映
    【本报讯】中央电影局东北电影制片厂出品《无形的战线》自今（十七）日起至二十一日在京市中国、解放、同乐、国民等电影院上映。该片表现了人民政府公安干部的反匪特斗争。当蒋匪武装力量已被消灭之后，残余匪特潜伏在解放区内利用一部分工作人员的麻痹与疏忽，逼迫胁从分子钻入我们的工厂进行阴谋破坏。经我公安干部依靠群众调查研究，并对胁从分子进行教育，终于破获了匪特组织，使特务头子受到人民的裁判。
