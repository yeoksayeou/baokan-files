　　Star of the East
　　Xinhua News Agency, Prague, February 17th. The London "Daily Worker" published an editorial on the 16th entitled "Star of the East." The editorial pointed out: Amidst all the talk of war, the East has issued a call for peace and reason. The Foreign Ministers of China and the Soviet Union, representing seven hundred million people, have signed a treaty of friendship, alliance, and mutual assistance, and have reached agreements on fraternal economic cooperation. This is an event of world historical significance, in comparison to which Truman's statement on the hydrogen bomb seems insignificant. The editorial stated: We celebrate this great event, which has immeasurably strengthened the world's forces for peace.
　　The editorial continued: In sharp contrast to the North Atlantic war pact, this treaty closely conforms to the United Nations Charter. With the signing of the North Atlantic war pact, the United States obtained bases in Britain and Western Europe, and American troops entered the territories of all the countries that signed the pact. But according to the Sino-Soviet agreement, the Chinese Changchun Railway will be wholly owned by the People's Republic of China, and Soviet troops will withdraw from Lushunkou. Treaty rights that the Soviet Union had correctly protected from encroachment by the U.S. puppet Chiang Kai-shek government are now freely returned to the Chinese People's Government.
　　The editorial pointed out: The People's Republic of China now receives the unreserved and unconditional assistance of the largest industrial power. The mighty Soviet Union has promised to grant China a long-term economic loan. This enables China to acquire industrial and railway equipment to pursue China's rapid industrialization and raise the living standards of its people.
　　The editorial emphasized the importance of this event for the East, saying: This treaty guarantees peace and security in the Far East. While the Colombo Conference only plans further bloody colonial wars and exploitation, the treaty between the Soviet Union and China signifies peace, prosperity, and a guarantee of freedom for hundreds of millions of people in the East. This treaty and the agreements signed with it expose the arrogant slander of U.S. Secretary of State Acheson that the Soviet Union intends to annex Manchuria. It dooms to failure all the activities of American and British imperialism that seek to enslave Asia.

    英工人日报庆贺中苏条约
    【新华社布拉格十七日电】伦敦工人日报于十六日以《东方的明星》为题发表社论。社论指出：在一片谈论战争声中，东方发出了和平与理智的呼声。中国和苏联的外交部长，代表着七万万人民，签订了友好同盟互助条约，并已达成兄弟般的经济合作的协定。这是具有世界历史意义的事件，相形之下，杜鲁门的关于氢弹的声明，是显得无足轻重的事。社论说：我们庆贺这一伟大事件，它已无可衡量地加强了世界争取和平的力量。
    社论又说：和北大西洋战争公约恰恰相反，这条约密切符合联合国宪章。签订了北大西洋战争公约，美国就在英国和西欧取得基地，美国军队便开进了所有签订该公约的国家的领土。但是按照中苏协定，中国长春铁路将完全为中华人民共和国所有，苏联军队将撤出旅顺口。苏联所曾正确地加以保护、使不受美国的傀儡蒋介石政府之侵犯的条约权利，现在正自由地归还中国的人民政府。
    社论指出：中华人民共和国现在得到了最大工业强国的毫无约束、毫无条件的帮助。强大的苏联已答应给予中国一笔长期的经济贷款。这使中国能够取得工业的和铁路的装备，以谋中国的迅速工业化并提高它的人民的生活水平。
    社论强调指出这一事件对东方的重要意义说：这条约保障远东的和平与安全。科伦坡会议只会计划更进一步的流血的殖民战争和剥削，而苏联和中国的条约，却意味着和平、繁荣与保障东方亿万人民的自由。这条约和一同签订的那些协定，揭穿了美国国务卿艾奇逊所说苏联打算兼并满洲的狂妄诽谤。它使美英帝国主义力求奴役亚洲的一切活动命定地非失败不可。
