Xinhua News Agency, Kaifeng, 30th -- In Henan Province, peasant associations and militia forces have been increasingly developing and growing stronger in the mass movements of suppressing bandits, opposing local bullies, and reducing rent. Peasants who have initially turned themselves over have already grasped the majority of rural political power and armed forces. There are currently more than 2,218,500 members of peasant associations in Henan Province, accounting for approximately 30% of the population in areas where the masses have been mobilized. Peasant associations have been established in most counties and districts of the province, and the preparatory committee of the Provincial Peasant Association was established in the early part of last month. The preparatory committee has also decided to convene a provincial peasant representative conference in late February to formally establish the Provincial Peasant Association to unify the leadership of peasant organizations and peasant movements throughout the province. Currently, peasant representative conferences are being held in various counties. Counties that have not yet established county peasant associations or county peasant association preparatory committees are also in the process of establishing them in order to prepare the foundation for the convening of the provincial peasant representative conference. In some areas, the landlord class once took advantage of defects in the work caused by certain cadres' impatience and crude work styles, taking the opportunity to organize fake peasant associations or infiltrating peasant association organizations to usurp leadership. After the county and district people's governments and peasant associations exposed this, they simultaneously led the peasants to cleanse class alien elements through the method of "investigating the turned-over, investigating thought, and investigating enemies," and universally rectified and transformed the peasant associations, and the general organization has become relatively pure. Among the powerful peasant ranks, women have become a major force, with more than 800,000 women having been organized, and they have played an active role in the struggles against bandits and local bullies. The Communist Party's organization has also greatly developed. Many organized male and female peasants, after being educated by the Communist Party and tested by various struggles, have joined the Communist Party. According to statistics, more than 38,000 impoverished and outstanding peasants throughout the province have been recommended by the masses and approved by the local CCP committees to become glorious Communist Party members. In the Xuchang sub-region, more than 70% of the villages in Baofeng, Xiangxian, Yexian, Jiaxian, Lushan, Yuxian, Linru and other seven counties have CCP branches or groups, with at least three Party members in each village, and they have become the core of various movements. In addition, in most villages where the masses have been mobilized, various organizations such as the New Democratic Youth League and the Young Pioneers have also been established.

Due to the victory in suppressing bandits and opposing local bullies, the vast majority of rural political power in Henan has been grasped by the peasants. In Henan Province, out of 86 counties, the village political power in 52 counties and more than 300 districts has been transferred to the peasants. In order to defend the fruits of victory they have already obtained, the vast number of peasants who have initially turned themselves over have demanded to be armed, and the militia organization has therefore rapidly expanded. According to incomplete statistics from Xuchang, Luoyang, Zhengzhou, Shanzhou, Shangqiu, Huaiyang and other special districts in November last year, the militia has developed to more than 140,000 people, becoming an important guarantee for stabilizing and consolidating rural social order. The composition of peasant associations, peasant committees, and political power organizations is based on the poor peasants and farm laborers who constitute the largest majority of the rural population, while also firmly uniting the middle peasants. In various organizations, middle peasants generally have representatives participating in proportion to their population (approximately one-third).

[This Newspaper's News] The seven counties of Baofeng, Jiaxian, Xiangcheng, Lushan, Yuxian, Yexian, and Linru in the Xuchang Special District of Henan Province successively convened people's representative conferences from all walks of life in mid-to-late December last year. The common feature of the conferences in each county was that peasant representatives, representing the opinions of the vast number of peasants, demanded the implementation of land reform to completely destroy the feudal exploitation system. At the people's representative conference in Jiaxian County, 1,521 written proposals were received from representatives from all walks of life, of which more than 880 demanded the rapid implementation of land reform. At the meeting, the peasant representatives from each county used the facts of their own suffering from feudal exploitation to illustrate the pain of the vast number of peasants who lacked land. They said: The Communist Party has come to lead the peasants to oppose bullies and reduce rent, and the lives of the peasants have improved somewhat. However, because they lack land, it is not enough for a family to live on. Therefore, they demanded the implementation of land reform. Representatives from other fields, such as women, business, education, and democratic figures, also spoke successively, warmly supporting the implementation of land reform.

Representatives from all counties held heated discussions on the land reform policies of "not moving the middle, leveling the two ends," "dividing classes according to whether there is labor, whether there is exploitation, and how much exploitation there is," and "protecting industry and commerce," and "as long as landlords participate in labor, they will also be given the same amount of land as peasants." Representatives from all walks of life unanimously supported these policies.

After the people's representative conferences in each county, the opinions and common demands of people from all walks of life were concentrated, and the government's policies and decrees were implemented, resulting in three major resolutions on land reform, winter defense, and production preparation for famine. These will serve as this year's administrative guidelines.

　　经过剿匪反霸减租运动
    河南农民掌握农村政权
    许昌等县农民要求实行土地改革
    【新华社开封三十日电】河南省的农会组织及民兵武装在剿匪、反恶霸和减租等群众运动中，日益发展和壮大，初步翻了身的农民已经掌握了多数农村政权及武装。河南全省现有农民协会会员二百二十一万八千五百余名，占已经发动群众地区人口的百分之三十左右。该省大部县区都已经建立了农民协会，省农民协会筹备委员会已于上月上旬成立，筹委会并已决定在二月下旬召开全省农民代表大会，正式成立省农民协会，以统一全省农民组织和农民运动的领导。现在各县的农民代表大会正在纷纷举行，未成立县农民协会或县农民协会筹备委员会的县份亦正在成立，为全省农民代表大会的召开准备基础。有些地区地主阶级曾利用某些干部因为急性和粗糙作风而造成的工作中的缺陷，乘机组织假农会，或打入农会组织，篡夺领导权。经县区人民政府和农民协会揭发，同时领导农民通过“查翻身、查思想、查敌人”的方法洗刷阶级异己分子，普遍整顿和改造了农会，一般组织已较纯洁。在强大的农民队伍中，妇女已成为一支主要的力量，有八十余万妇女已经组织起来，她们在剿匪和反恶霸等斗争中发挥了积极的作用。共产党的组织也有很大发展。许多有组织的男女农民经过共产党的教育和各种斗争的考验后，参加了共产党。据统计，全省已有三万八千余贫苦优秀的农民，由群众推荐，经过各该地中共党委的批准而成为了光荣的共产党员。许昌分区的宝丰、襄县、叶县、郏县、鲁山、禹县、临汝等七县百分之七十以上的村庄都有了中共支部或小组，每村至少有党员三人以上，他们成为各种运动中的核心。此外，在已发动群众的大部村庄里，新民主主义青年团和少年儿童队等各种组织也已经建立起来。
    河南的广大农村政权，由于剿匪反恶霸的胜利，多数已为农民所掌握。河南全省八十六个县中已有五十二个县、三百多个区的村政权转到农民手中。初步翻了身的广大农民，为了保卫已经得到的胜利果实，纷纷要求武装起来，民兵组织因而迅速扩大。据去年十一月间许昌、洛阳、郑州、陕州、商邱、淮阳等专区不完全的统计，民兵武装已发展到十四万余人，成为稳定与巩固农村社会秩序的重要保障。农民协会、农民委员会、政权组织等构成，都以占乡村人口最大多数的贫农和雇农为主体，同时巩固地团结了中农，各种组织中，中农一般都有与其人口比例相适应（大约三分之一）的代表参加。
    【本报讯】河南省许昌专区宝丰，郏县、襄城、鲁山、禹县、叶县、临汝等七县于去年十二月中、下旬相继召开了各界人民代表会议，各县此次会议的共同特点是：农民代表代表广大农民意见要求实行土地改革，彻底摧垮封建剥削制度。在郏县各界代表会议上收到各界代表的书面提案一千五百二十一件，其中要求迅速实行土地改革的即达八百八十余件。各县的农民代表在会议上以自己亲身遭受封建剥削的事实，说明广大农民没土地的痛苦。他们说：共产党来了，领导农民反霸、减租，农民的生活有些改善。但因为缺少土地，一家老小还不够生活。因此要求实行土地改革。其他如妇女界、商界、教育界、民主人士等代表，也都先后发言，热烈拥护实行土地改革。
    各县代表对土地改革政策“中间不动两头平”、“按照有无劳动，有无剥削，剥削多少划分阶级”和“保护工商业”、“只要地主参加劳动，也分给与农民一样多的土地”等问题，均展开了热烈讨论，各界代表均一致拥护。
    各县经过此次各界代表会议后，集中了各界人民的意见与共同要求，并从而贯彻了政府的政策法令，作出土地改革、冬防、生产备荒等三大决议。作为今年的施政方针。
