Telegram from the National Congress of the Chinese Railway Workers' Union

To Chairman Mao of the Central People's Government, with Respect:

Our congress opened on February 7th in the people's capital, Beijing. All delegates, on behalf of the 440,000 railway workers, technical personnel, and staff across the country, extend our highest respects to you!

We railway workers, together with the people of the whole country, under the leadership of the Central People's Government headed by Chairman Mao, have expelled imperialism, overthrown feudalism, eliminated bureaucratic capitalism, and achieved great victories. We deeply know that the achievement of such victories has paid a great price, and the cause of building a new China requires even greater efforts. We call on all railway employees across the country to inherit the glorious revolutionary tradition, execute all policies and laws of our government with high enthusiasm and effort, resolutely guarantee the completion of and strive to exceed the glorious tasks assigned by the state to build people's railways and strengthen transportation services, and struggle to greet the upcoming high tide of economic construction in new China!

To Chairman Mao and the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, with Respect:

Dear Chairman Mao and the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party: Starting from the 27th anniversary of the "February 7th" strike, we convened the National Congress. Over 300 delegates elected by more than 440,000 railway workers, technical personnel, and staff from across the country are here. We will establish our highest leading body - the National Committee of the Chinese Railway Workers' Union. We deeply feel that today's great victory of the Chinese people's revolution and the people's liberation war is entirely due to your and the Chinese Communist Party's wise leadership. We extend our most loyal and highest respects to you and the Party Central Committee. At the same time, we also realize that today's great victory is only the beginning of building a new China, and the more important task of national-scale economic construction is already before us. The smooth completion of the economic construction task is closely related to the rapid restoration and development of railway transportation. To this end, we have enthusiastically discussed the 1950 construction and transportation plan announced by the Ministry of Railways of the Central People's Government. This is an arduous and glorious task. We hereby express to you and the Party Central Committee that we will unite all railway workers, technical personnel, and staff across the country, overcome all difficulties, and strive to ensure the completion of and strive to exceed this plan!

Respectfully submitted by all delegates of the National Congress of the Chinese Railway Workers' Union

To Commander-in-Chief Zhu and All Commanders and Fighters of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, with Respect:

Commander-in-Chief Zhu and all commanders and fighters of the Chinese People's Liberation Army:

The National Congress of the Chinese Railway Workers' Union opened on February 7th in the people's capital - Beijing. We, on behalf of more than 440,000 railway workers, technical personnel, and staff across the country, extend our highest respects to you – the creators of the great victory of the Chinese People's Liberation War.

Now, the feudalism that has oppressed us for more than three thousand years, the imperialist forces that have invaded our country for more than a hundred years, and the bureaucratic capitalism that has betrayed the country and harmed the people for more than twenty years have been overthrown and overthrown under the iron fist of the Chinese People's Liberation Army. We railway workers across the country, along with the broad masses of the people, have changed from the oppressed slave status to become the masters of the new China and the new society. We will forever remember your great achievements!

In the great People's Liberation War, we have made meager efforts to support the front lines, but we clearly recognize that the more important tasks of economic construction and national defense construction are before us. We vow to use a hundred times the effort to strive to complete and exceed the 1950 construction and transportation plan of the Ministry of Railways of the Central People's Government to support you.

To the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, with Respect:

All-China Federation of Trade Unions:

The National Congress of the Chinese Railway Workers' Union, representing more than 440,000 railway employees in China, convened in the people's capital - Beijing on the historically significant February 7th. All delegates extend the highest class respect to the banner of the Chinese working class - the All-China Federation of Trade Unions.

For twenty-seven years, in order to strive for the organization of our own trade union and the liberation of the working class, we have waged a long and arduous struggle against imperialism and its running dogs, the feudal warlords. Today, thanks to the wise leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, we have initially realized our hopes. We railway employees across the country have experienced many hardships and deeply feel the difficulty in creating victory. In the future, we will rally around the Chinese Railway Workers' Union, further consolidate our own unity, and unite the working class of the whole country to resolutely stand under the banner of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, faithfully respond to your every call, and strive to complete the railway transportation and construction plan of the Ministry of Railways of the Central People's Government in 1950, and strive to build an independent, democratic, peaceful, unified, and prosperous and strong new China!

To All Commanders and Fighters of the Railway Corps, with Respect:

Commander Teng and Deputy Commander Lü, Deputy Political Commissar Cui, Chief of Staff Li, and all commanders and fighters of the Railway Corps:

The National Congress of the Chinese Railway Workers' Union officially opened on February 7th, which has great historical significance, in the people's capital - Beijing. We, on behalf of more than 440,000 railway workers, technical personnel, and staff across the country, extend our highest respect to you who have made outstanding contributions to the restoration of the people's railway cause!

In 1949, when the People's Liberation War and the People's Revolution achieved great victories, thanks to your selfless spirit and courageous efforts in restoring the national railways to ensure our common glorious task, that is, "wherever the Liberation Army fights, the railway is built, and the train goes there," you played a significant role in the completion. Now, under the joint leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, the final victory on a national scale is about to come, and the arduous task of national-scale economic construction is before us. At the beginning of this economic construction, the Ministry of Railways of the Central People's Government has timely announced the 1950 railway construction and transportation plan. Comrades! Let us join hands more closely, give greater play to our enthusiasm and creativity, and strive to guarantee the completion of and strive to exceed this plan!

Support the Soviet Proposal to Try Japanese Emperor Hirohito and Other Five Major Germ Warfare Criminals

Our government replied to the Soviet government on February 8th, fully agreeing to appoint an international special military tribunal to try the five major germ warfare criminals headed by Japanese Emperor Hirohito. The National Congress of the Chinese Railway Workers' Union, on behalf of railway employees across the country, expresses firm support for this proposal, which meets the requirements of the Chinese people and the people of the world, with infinite joy.

The Chinese working class and the Chinese people will never forget the inhuman and beastly behavior of Japanese imperialism in using bacteria to slaughter people in the unjust war of aggression against China. We solemnly protest against the crime of US imperialism shielding war criminals such as Hirohito, and demand that they be handed over for trial immediately and severely punished in order to uphold human justice and maintain world peace.

Condolences to Compatriots in Shanghai and Other Places Affected by the US-Made Bandit Aircraft Bombing

To the Railway Workers' Union of Shanghai District, to be forwarded to the compatriots affected by the disaster in Shanghai:

After the People's Liberation Army completely annihilated and cleared the remnants of the bandit troops on the Chinese mainland, US imperialism and its running dogs used aircraft to indiscriminately bomb the Chinese people in Shanghai and other places in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River. This violent behavior of the bandits was carried out with the direct participation of US imperialists and the Japanese aggressors they supported. With extreme anger, we, on behalf of 440,000 railway employees across the country, extend our cordial condolences to all compatriots affected by the disaster in Shanghai, and lodge a serious protest with the US imperialists. We will resolutely complete and exceed the Ministry of Railways' 1950 work plan, build the people's railways better, and support the People's Liberation Army in liberating Taiwan and Hainan Island with rapid and efficient transportation efficiency, and completely destroy the last nest of the bandit gang as our response to the bombing by US imperialism and the bandit gang!
