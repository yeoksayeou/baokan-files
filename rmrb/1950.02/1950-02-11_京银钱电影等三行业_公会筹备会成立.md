Beijing: Trade Union Preparatory Committees Established for Banking, Money Exchange, and Film Industries

[Beijing News] Yesterday, the joint inaugural meeting of the preparatory committees for the trade unions of the banking, money exchange, and film industries was held at the Central Cinema. At the meeting, Fu Huating, Director of the Preparatory Committee of the Federation of Industry and Commerce, first delivered an opening speech, explaining that after the establishment of the Preparatory Committee of the Federation of Industry and Commerce, it immediately began to reorganize the old industry organizations. The establishment of the preparatory committees for the banking, money exchange, and film industries is the first among the more than one hundred industries in Beijing. He believes that after the establishment of the new industries, old bad habits will be eradicated, new and excellent work styles will be established, and they will serve the cause of economic and cultural construction of New Democracy. Then, Han Songshang, representing the banking and money exchange industries, reported on the preparation process and work outline of the preparatory committee. He said: In the past, under the oppression and manipulation of imperialism and bureaucratic capital, the banking and money exchange industries engaged in illegal business activities and exploited the people for a few warlords and bureaucrats. In the year since liberation, under the leadership and education of the government, the banking and money exchange industries should review the past and strive for renewal. However, there are still a few firms and banks that ignore government decrees, speculate in gold and silver, and continue to engage in illegal activities such as back-door operations, which are indeed a stain on the financial industry. In the future, we must thoroughly change our business operation policies and strive to develop production and prosper the economy. He continued to report on the work outline of the preparatory committee jointly formulated by the banking and money exchange industries, which includes the following important points: under the leadership of the People's Government, implement the financial policies stipulated in the Common Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference; plan to establish a joint loan syndicate to support industries, handicrafts, and commerce that are beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood; investigate and study market conditions and formulate reasonable deposit and loan interest rates and exchange rates; promote the signing of collective contracts and achieve labor-management cooperation, etc. Next, Yang Yizhi, representative of the film industry, reported on the preparation process of the industry's preparatory committee, and explained that in order to respond to the government's call, the film industry took the initiative to change to showing progressive films. Although business was affected by difficulties such as the lack of films, most members and all employees firmly stood at their posts and overcame the difficulties. By November last year, business had improved, and some even exceeded previous levels. After the establishment of the preparatory committee, it will definitely be able to better fulfill the propaganda mission of New Democratic culture. Jia Xingwu, manager of the Beijing branch of the People's Bank of China, gave a special speech to the banking and money exchange industries at the meeting. He pointed out: From last year to the present, the banking and money exchange industries have been in a process of transformation and change, and many firms and banks have begun to combine their businesses with production. However, what has been done is not enough, and even a few firms and banks still maintain the old work style and engage in illegal business activities. The overriding central task for 1950 is production. It is hoped that the banking and money exchange industries can truly serve production after the establishment of the preparatory committee and assist the government in assuming the task of regulating finance and solving production funds. Zhang Jincheng, Deputy Director of the Municipal Bureau of Commerce, pointed out in his speech: In the past, under the reactionary regime, because the banking and money exchange industries did not have correct business policies, they engaged in speculation and price gouging, disrupting finance and prices. In the future, they must serve the cause of production, assist in the development of industry and commerce that are beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood, and gradually transform Beijing from a consumer city into a production city. Guo Youyi, representative of the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, and Bureau Chief Bao of the Second Branch of the Municipal Taxation Bureau continued to speak, and finally Qin Zhibu, representative of the banking and money exchange industries, and Xu Xingbai, representative of the film industry, delivered reply speeches.

The preparatory committee members of the three industries have been separately elected by each industry and approved and appointed by the Preparatory Committee of the Federation of Industry and Commerce. The preparatory committee members of each industry have also mutually elected chairmen and vice-chairmen. The chairman of the banking industry is Han Songshang, and the vice-chairman is Tang Qingyong; the chairman of the money exchange industry is Qin Zhibu, and the vice-chairmen are Liang Zhengfu and Xu Zicai; the chairman of the film industry is Yang Yizhi, and the vice-chairmen are Wei Geng and Xu Xingbai.

　　京银钱电影等三行业
    公会筹备会成立
    【北京讯】银行、钱庄、电影业昨日假中央电影院举行三行业公会筹备会联合成立大会。会上首由工商联合会筹委会主任委员傅华亭致开会词，说明工商联合会筹委会成立后即着手进行整理旧的行业组织。这次银行、钱庄、电影三行业筹备会的成立，是京市百余行业中的第一次。他相信在新行业成立后一定能革除旧的坏习惯，树立新的优良作风，为新民主主义的经济建设事业和文化事业而服务。继由韩诵裳代表银行、钱庄两业报告筹备会的筹备经过及工作大纲。他说：过去银钱业在帝国主义和官僚资本的压迫操纵下，从事非法营业，替少数军阀官僚们剥削人民。解放一年来，银钱业在政府的领导与教育下，应当检讨既往，力求更新。但仍有少数行庄，忽视政府法令，倒卖金银，继续后帐经营等不法行为，实为金融业的污点。今后我们要彻底改变业务经营方针，为发展生产繁荣经济而努力。他继续报告银钱两业共同拟定的筹备会工作纲要，其中重要的有：在人民政府领导下，执行中国人民政协共同纲领中规定的金融政策；计划举办联合贷款团，以扶植有利于国计民生的工业、手工业及商业；调查与研究市场情况拟订合理的存放款利率及汇率；推动集体合同的签订，取得劳资协力等。接着电影业代表杨宜之报告该业筹备会的筹备经过，并说明电影业为了响应政府的号召，主动改演进步影片，虽因片量不足等困难使营业受到影响，但大部会员和全体职工都坚定地站在自己的岗位，克服了困难，至去年十一月，营业已趋好转，有的并超出以前的水准。筹备会成立后，一定能更好地完成新民主主义文化的宣传任务。中国人民银行北京分行经理贾星五在会上特别对银钱两业发表讲话。他指出：从去年到现在，银钱两业是处在改造和转变过程中，有不少行庄已把它们的业务开始和生产事业结合。但做的还不够，甚至还有少数行庄仍存在着旧的作风，从事非法的营业。一九五○年压倒一切的中心任务是生产，希望银钱两业在筹备会成立后能够切实地为生产服务，协助政府担负起调剂金融解决生产资金的任务。市商业局副局长张锦城在讲话中指出：银钱业过去在反动的政权下，因为没有正确的营业方针，则从事投机倒把活动，扰乱金融物价。今后要为生产事业服务，协助发展有利于国计民生的工商业，使北京从消费的城市逐渐转变为生产城市。继续讲话的有市总工会代表郭有义，市税务局第二分局鲍局长，最后由银钱业代表秦芝圃，电影业代表徐行白致答词。
    该三行业的筹备委员，已由各行业分别选出，并由工商联合会筹委会核定聘任。各行业的筹备委员并互推主任委员和副主任委员。银行业主任委员为韩诵裳，副主任委员为唐庆永；钱庄业主任委员为秦芝圃、副主任委员为梁征甫、徐子才；电影业主任委员为杨宜之，副主任委员为魏赓、徐行白。
