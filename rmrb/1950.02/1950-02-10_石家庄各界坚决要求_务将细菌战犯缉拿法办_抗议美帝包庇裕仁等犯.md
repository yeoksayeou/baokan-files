　　[Our Newspaper Shijiazhuang Eighth Electric Dispatch] People from all walks of life here unanimously support the Soviet government's proposal to try the main Japanese bacterial war criminals. Workers, natural science workers, medical workers, the Municipal Women's Federation, and others held symposiums, unanimously advocating the trial of Japanese Emperor Hirohito and other murderers, and protested against the American imperialists who shielded bacterial war criminals. Lu Quan, director of the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, said: The number of Chinese laboring people massacred by Japanese fascist executioners is countless. Shijiazhuang workers resolutely support this just proposal from the Soviet Union. Natural science workers and medical workers Li Shijun, Dai Xizhi, and others believe: Judging from the heinous crimes of the Japanese fascist bandits, it is even clearer to everyone who uses science as an inhumane tool of slaughter and who develops science to benefit mankind. They support the Soviet Union's proposal and demand that bacterial war criminals must be arrested and brought to justice for trial and conviction. At the symposium held by the Municipal Women's Federation, everyone agreed that during the eight-year War of Resistance Against Japan, many women lost their sons and husbands, and key war criminals like Hirohito must be severely punished. They resolutely demand revenge for the compatriots who died. Chen Ningqing, a bacteriology teacher at North China Medical University, wrote a special article in the Shijiazhuang Daily entitled "The Difference Between Bacterial War Criminals and Ordinary War Criminals." After detailing the properties of several bacteria that poison humans, he explained: These bacteria, if not deliberately spread by humans, would bring enormous destruction to mankind, but the barbaric Japanese fascist bandits felt that the disaster that bacteria brought to mankind was too small, and mobilized a large number of experts and more than 3,000 staff to cultivate these murderous bacteria. The special article emphasized: If it were not for the heroic Soviet Red Army quickly destroying the Japanese fascist Kwantung Army and liberating the Japanese base for preparing for bacterial warfare, large-scale bacterial warfare and all its terrible consequences for mankind would have been unimaginable.

　　石家庄各界坚决要求
    务将细菌战犯缉拿法办
    抗议美帝包庇裕仁等犯
    【本报石家庄八日专电】此间各界人民，一致拥护苏联政府关于审讯日本主要细菌战犯的建议。工人们、自然科学工作者、医务工作者、市妇联等分别召开了座谈会，一致主张审判日本天皇裕仁等杀人犯，并向包庇细菌战犯的美帝国主义者提出抗议。市总工会主任陆铨说：日本法西斯刽子手屠杀我国劳动人民是不可数计的，石家庄工人们坚决拥护苏联这个正义的提议。自然科学工作者和医务工作者李世俊、戴锡祉等认为：从日本法西斯匪徒的滔天罪行看来，世界上谁利用科学作毫无人性的屠杀工具，谁发展科学造福人群，已使大家更为清楚。他们拥护苏联的主张，并要求务必将细菌战犯缉拿归案。审判定罪。市妇联召开的座谈会上，大家一致认为：八年抗日战争中，许多妇女失去了自己的儿子和丈夫，像裕仁这样的首要战犯必须严厉制裁。她们坚决要求为被难同胞复仇。华北医科大学细菌学教员陈宁庆在石家庄日报上撰述“细菌战犯和普通战犯的不同”的专文，在详述几种细菌毒杀人类的性能以后，说明：这些细菌没有人故意传播就会给人类带来巨大的毁灭，而野蛮的日本法西斯匪徒却嫌细菌给人类的灾难太小，调集大批专家和三千多工作人员来培养这些杀人的细菌。专文强调指出：要不是英勇的苏联红军迅速摧毁日本法西斯关东军和解放了日寇准备细菌战争的基地，大规模的细菌战争及其对人类的一切可怕后果将会不可设想。
