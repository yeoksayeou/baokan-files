　　People's Liberation Army Commanders and Fighters
    Practice Thrift to Purchase Public Bonds
    [This Newspaper Dispatches] To assist the government in overcoming financial difficulties, People's Liberation Army units across the country are actively practicing thrift and purchasing public bonds. The commanders and fighters of the North China People's Liberation Army units have always lived a hard life. However, in order to help the government overcome the financial difficulties of 1950, they are still enthusiastically purchasing public bonds. Some soldiers, short on money, combine their funds with several others to buy one share. Some squads and platoons also make joint purchases. According to statistics from twenty-five units at the end of last month, more than 18,000 shares of public bonds had already been purchased. (Correct)
    Under the call to "Voluntarily Subscribe to Victory Bonds to the Best of Our Ability," a certain army of the People's Liberation Army launched a fervent upsurge of bond purchases, with all commanders and fighters enthusiastically participating. Some not only used all their allowances to purchase public bonds but also took out their small past savings to buy them. On average, companies purchased fifteen shares, with some purchasing as many as forty shares. Some commanders and fighters not only purchased bonds themselves but also promoted bond subscriptions among the local people. (Lu Degong)
    The directly subordinate organs and troops of the Hebei Military Region are also extremely enthusiastic about purchasing public bonds. According to statistics from the Military Region Political Department last month, the officers and soldiers of this department purchased a total of 1,258 shares. Including the various departments of the Military Region Command, Political Department, Supply Department, and Health Department, a total of 2,800 shares were purchased, and 1,500 shares were purchased through organ production.

    Since receiving the "Instruction on Purchasing Public Bonds" from higher authorities, a certain PLA garrison in Qinhuangdao immediately mobilized for subscriptions by the Party committee. All commanders and fighters regard purchasing public bonds as gloriously as performing combat missions. As of the latter part of last month, in a certain regiment of this unit, individual and joint purchasers totaled 560 shares, and purchasers in the various regiments and directly subordinate units had reached more than 1,720 shares.

    节衣缩食购买公债
    【本报讯】各地人民解放军为协助政府克服财政困难，纷纷节衣缩食购买公债。华北解放军各部队指战员，生活素来艰苦。但为了协助政府渡过一九五○年的财政困难，仍然踊跃购买公债。有的战士钱少，就几个人联合共买一分。有的一班、一排亦联合购买。到上月底据二十五个单位统计，已购公债一万八千多分。（正）
    解放军某军在“尽自己力量自愿认购胜利公债”的号召下，全军指战员热烈掀起购债热潮，有的除将津贴全部购买公债外，还把过去的仅有的一点积蓄也拿出来买了。一般连队平均都购买了十五分，最多的买到四十分。还有的指战员不但自己购买，还向驻地群众进行宣传认购。（路得功）
    河北军区直属机关部队购买公债亦极为踊跃。据军区政治部上月统计：该部干部战士共购买一千二百五十八分。连同军区司、政、供、卫各部，共买到二千八百分，机关生产购买一千五百余分。（傅英杰）
    人民解放军秦皇岛某部驻军，自接到上级“关于购买公债指示”后，该部党委即动员认购。全体指战员视购买公债如执行战斗任务一样的光荣。至上月下旬该部某团，个人及合购者即达五六○分，各团及直属队认购者已达一千七百二十余分。（肖泽林、崔光荣）
