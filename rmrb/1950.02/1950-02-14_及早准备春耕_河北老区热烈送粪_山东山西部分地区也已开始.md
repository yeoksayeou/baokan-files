　　Preparing for Spring Plowing Early
　　Old Liberated Areas of Hebei Enthusiastically Deliver Manure
　　Parts of Shandong and Shanxi Have Also Begun
　　[This newspaper reports] Farmers in the old liberated areas of Wangdu, Renqiu, Cheng'an, Mancheng, Yi County, Anping and other counties in Hebei Province, under the slogan "Spring is short, act early, deliver manure early," have launched a surge of manure delivery. Farmers in the fourth district of Cheng'an County reflected, "This year's solar term is early, and spring is short, so manure must be delivered earlier." The district leaders gathered the opinions of the masses and mobilized farmers to deliver manure early. Ten villages have accumulated a total of 10,400 carts of manure, and more than 7,500 carts have already been delivered to the fields. Renqiu had heavy rainfall last year, and the ground is now frozen, and it is estimated that the ground will be difficult to walk on after thawing. The leadership promptly put forward the slogan "When the weather warms up and the ground thaws, deliver manure early while it's frozen," mobilizing farmers to deliver manure early. Farmers in the county are now busy getting manure out of the pens, breaking it up, and delivering it. Cadres in Wangdu, Anping and other counties are also actively leading the masses to deliver manure. By the 23rd of last month, 80 percent of the manure accumulated in the villages of Wangdu had been delivered. Many counties and districts pay close attention to helping the families of revolutionary martyrs to solve difficulties in the manure delivery campaign. Tang County delivered 2,900 carts of manure to the families of revolutionary martyrs. Yi County delivered all the manure for more than 400 families of revolutionary martyrs.
　　Zhuoxian County, a newly liberated area, has also dispatched capable cadres to lead the farmers in the county to deliver manure. On the 14th of last month, each district convened a meeting of farmer representatives to arrange for manure delivery. After the farmer representatives from each village returned to their villages, they widely publicized the government's opinions and called on farmers to prepare for spring plowing and deliver manure early. The farmer representatives of Jiejialou in the fifth district took the lead in delivering manure, influencing more than 70 households to take action and organize ten manure delivery teams. Of the 1,100 carts of manure in the whole village, 788 carts have been delivered. Farmers in newly distributed land in Liuheying and other villages are delivering manure to the fields by moonlight. By the 24th of last month, the delivery of manure had been widely launched throughout the county.
　　[Also reported] Farmers in some areas of the Bohai District of Shandong have started manure delivery work early due to the short spring this year. Because the land in Xiawa Town, Zhanhua County, is far from the village and the roads are sandy, it is very difficult to deliver manure. Last year, a lot of manure was not delivered to the fields. This year, the farmers in the town accepted the lessons of last year and strive to deliver all the manure to the fields before the thaw. The CCP branch secretary and village head of Daxiawa Village in the town took the lead in delivering manure together. In the past five days, 62 households have delivered 423 carts of manure together, and at the same time delivered 102 carts of manure to 12 families of revolutionary martyrs, military dependents, and workers' dependents.
　　[This newspaper reports] The leadership of Huguan, Shanxi, used the methods of calculating solar terms, manure piles, and time to break the masses' old habits of thinking "It's still early to deliver fertilizer in the first month of the lunar year." They put forward the slogan "Start early before spring, and don't panic when spring is busy" to mobilize the masses to deliver manure early. In Dajing, out of a total of 250 households, 166 households have delivered fertilizer to the fields, and 19 households have delivered all of it. Li Laibao and Qin Guilian from Hanzhuang Village publicized the benefits of delivering manure early in the past, promoting the delivery of more than 60,000 dan of fertilizer in half a month throughout the village. Zhao Quanshui, an old farmer from Shinandi Village, explained the benefits of watering wheat at the mass meeting, and the masses watered all 200 mu of wheat with night soil.
　　Last winter, the county accumulated 6,639,973 dan of fertilizer (an average of 58 dan per mu), and 2,136,000 dan have been delivered to the fields, accounting for more than one-third of the total fertilizer. Of the 25,061 mu of wheat fields, 5,712.5 mu have been watered with night soil, accounting for more than 25 percent of the total wheat fields.
