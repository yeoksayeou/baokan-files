　  The Wuhan Municipal Government is hanging glorious plaques for the families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers throughout the city, and presenting them with letters of condolence and theater tickets sent by the Political Department of the Central and Southern Military Region. In Guangzhou, various government organizations have launched a campaign for each person to contribute an item and write a letter to show support for the troops. Farmers in the Xishan District of the city have initiated a "one jin of vegetables for the troops" campaign. Other cities in the Central and Southern region, such as Nanchang, Kaifeng, and Changsha, are also extending holiday greetings to the garrisoned troops and providing material assistance to the impoverished families of revolutionary martyrs, soldiers, and workers. In rural areas, teams are being organized to cultivate land on behalf of the families of revolutionary martyrs, soldiers, and workers to help them overcome production difficulties, and their children are being admitted to schools free of charge. The campaign to support the troops is also being enthusiastically carried out in Chongqing. As of the 15th, the troop support campaign committee had received 130 million yuan in donations, 300 banners, 23,500 towels, 880 comfort bags, and many other items of support. On the 15th, representatives from all walks of life held a presentation ceremony in the Municipal Government. The long line of presentations, gifts loaded on trucks, rickshaws, sedan chairs, and carried on shoulder poles, poured in from all directions. Farmers from the suburbs carried the vegetables they had grown themselves, and women brought the cloth shoes and comfort bags they had made by hand, happily participating in the presentation. Condolence letters filled several large tables. A certain unit of the Second Field Army also received many condolence letters from various parts of North China, recounting their happy lives after they were liberated and given land. The Women's Federation of Daguo Village, Sixth District of Shijiazhuang City, wrote in a letter: "We will actively lead women in the village to make military shoes and socks to support you, and forever be your backup."

　  写信送菜挂光荣牌  永远做解放军后盾
    武汉市政府给全市烈、军属挂光荣牌，并赠送中南军区政治部寄来的慰问信和戏票。广州市各机关发起一人一物和写信运动劳军。该市西山区的农民发起一斤菜劳军运动。中南区的其他城市如南昌、开封、长沙也都向驻军贺节，给贫苦烈、军、工属以物质慰劳。各地农村中组织代耕队，帮助烈、军、工属解决生产的困难，并送他们的子弟免费入学。重庆市的劳军运动也热烈展开。截止十五日，劳军运动委员会收到劳军款一亿三千万元、锦旗三百面、毛巾二万三千五百条、慰问袋八百八十只和其他慰劳品甚多。十五日各界代表在市政府内举行献礼大会。漫长的献礼行列，装在卡车上、人力车上、滑竿上和挑着的礼物，从四面八方涌来。四郊农民挑着他们自己种植的菜蔬，妇女们拿着他们亲手制的布鞋和慰劳袋，愉快地参加献礼。慰问信堆满了几张大桌子。第二野战军某部还收到很多由华北各地寄来的慰问信，叙述他们翻身后分得了土地的美满生活。石门市第六区大郭村妇联会在信上写着“我们要在村中积极领导妇女做军鞋军袜，支援你们，永远做你们的后盾。”
