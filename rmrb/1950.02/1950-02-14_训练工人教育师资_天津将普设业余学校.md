　　Training Teachers for Workers' Education: Tianjin to Universally Establish Spare-Time Schools
    [Our Dispatch] Tianjin Municipality's Education Bureau will vigorously develop worker-peasant education in 1950. In addition to planning to open a worker-peasant rapid middle school after the summer vacation, the city will universally establish worker's spare-time schools. Currently, they are preparing to train teachers. The first session of the worker's spare-time school teacher training class already started on the 4th of this month and will complete studies on the 14th. A total of 200 students are participating in the studies. The content of the studies mainly focuses on a concise history of the labor movement and the experience of Soviet worker's education. When the training class opened, Han Hantong, Director of the Municipal Education Bureau, pointed out to all the students: "In the future, the direction of education work will mainly be to develop worker-peasant education." He hoped that everyone would actively study and transform their thinking in order to better serve the workers and peasants.
