Xinhua News Agency, Baoding, 4th. To further strengthen township work, Handan Prefecture in Hebei Province convened a township work conference from December 25th to 27th last year. The conference focused on discussing the important role of towns in production leadership and in urban-rural material exchange, and changed the tendency of many cadres to neglect township work and relax leadership over township work in the past.

There are many small and medium-sized towns in Handan Prefecture. Towns with a population of over 50,000 include Handan and Linqing; those with between 7,000 and 30,000 include Wu'an, Cixian, Daming, Quzhou, Guantao, Shexian, Pengcheng Town, Linmingguan, and Matou Town; and there are dozens with a population of around 5,000. Among them, with the exception of Handan and Linqing, which are doing relatively well, the rest have encountered many problems in their work due to cadres' insufficient understanding of the role of small towns, unfamiliarity with urban work, and lack of leadership experience, which have not been resolved, and small towns have not been able to play a role as a link connecting large cities and the vast countryside. Therefore, although the special district has been liberated for a long time, communication between large cities and the countryside has not been fully established. For example, local products that originally had sales cannot be sold, and the agricultural tools, fertilizers, and various industrial products needed by farmers cannot be supplied. The cadres working in these small towns are still afraid of leading or unable to lead industry and commerce; in general, smaller towns are even more inclined to only lead agriculture and not lead industry and commerce. Some cadres still indiscriminately regard all merchants as profiteers. Many merchants take the opportunity to speculate, manipulate, evade taxes, and deceive farmers. In addition, the impoverished residents in the towns have not been actively organized to engage in production.

The conference discussed the role of small towns in production, the work guidelines for small towns, the methods of leadership for small towns, and the current work content. Finally, Commissioner Sun Senfu made a summary based on everyone's opinions. He said: Whether it is a small city or a market town, it is a decentralized economic base. On the one hand, it is a center for guiding and improving rural production in the local area, and on the other hand, it is a base point for promoting urban-rural material exchange. The production and market economic activities of small towns directly affect the lives and production of farmers. Through it, large cities and the countryside can be connected; through it, we can gain an in-depth understanding of the exchange of industrial and agricultural products, which is convenient for state-owned enterprises to make more accurate production and supply and marketing plans. In the past, we did not have a sufficient understanding of this aspect, so we relaxed leadership over small towns, and this must be overcome in the future.

　　纠正放松领导城镇工作偏向
    邯郸专区加强城镇工作
    进一步发展城乡物资交流
    使中小城镇成为联系工农业生产纽带
    【新华社保定四日电】河北省邯郸专区为进一步加强城镇工作，于去年十二月二十五日至二十七日召开了城镇工作会议。这次会议着重讨论了城镇在生产的领导上以及在城乡物资交流上的重要作用，转变了过去不少干部忽视城镇工作和放松领导城镇工作的偏向。
    邯郸专区内有不少中小城镇。人口在五万以上的城镇有邯郸、临清；七千以上三万以下的有武安、磁县、大名、曲周、馆陶、涉县、彭城镇、临洺关、马头镇等；五千人口左右的则有数十个。其中除邯郸、临清工作较好外，其余多因干部对小城镇的作用认识不足、城市工作不熟悉、缺乏领导经验等原因，工作中发生了不少问题而未得到解决，未能使小城镇起着联系大城市和广大农村的纽带作用。因此该专区虽已解放很久，但是在大城市和乡村之间尚未完全沟通，如本来有销路的土产品不能推销出去，而农民需要的农具、肥料和各种工业品又供应不上。这些小城镇的工作干部至今仍有怕领导或不会领导工商业的；在一般较小城镇中更存在着仅领导农业、不领导工商业的偏向。有一部分干部则至今仍不加区别地把所有商人都认为是奸商。不少商人也就趁机进行投机、操纵、分散逃税、欺骗农民等。此外，对于城镇居民中生活困难的，尚未积极组织他们进行生产。
    会议研讨了小城镇在生产中的作用、小城镇的工作方针、对小城镇的领导方法及目前工作内容，最后由专员孙森甫根据大家意见作了总结。他说：不论小城市或集镇，都是分散的经济据点，一方面是当地指导与提高农村生产的中心，另一方面又是促进城乡物资交流的基点。小城镇的生产与市场经济活动，直接影响着农民的生活与生产。通过它可将大城市和农村联系起来；通过它可深入了解工农产品交流的情况，便于国营企业作出较正确的生产和供销计划。过去我们对这方面认识不足，因而放松对小城镇的领导，今后必须克服。
