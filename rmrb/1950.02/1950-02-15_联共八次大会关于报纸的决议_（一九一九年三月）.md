The Resolution of the Eighth Congress of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) on Newspapers
(March 1919)

(1) The general weakening of the Party's work during the period of civil war has most harmfully affected the condition of Party and Soviet newspapers. The general shortcomings of almost all our Party and Soviet periodicals - detachment from local - and not a few even from general political life. Provincial Party and Soviet newspapers almost completely fail to report on local life, and the selection of materials on general issues is extremely inappropriate. They publish lengthy and tedious articles, instead of articles written in concise and clear language that reflect the most important issues of general and local life. Sometimes entire pages are printed with documents, without summarizing the most important points in simple and clear language. Full texts of instructions and resolutions from various agencies are published, instead of compiling vivid social news of local life from these materials.

(2) All these shortcomings are largely due to the fact that the Party's best writing forces have gone to do state work, while newspapers in most cases have fallen into the hands of inexperienced staff.

(3) The Congress believes that local organizations should immediately take measures to improve Party and Soviet newspapers, and urges comrades to remember that newspapers are the most powerful tools of propaganda, agitation, and organization, and indispensable means of influencing the broadest masses.

(4) In order to improve Party and Soviet newspapers, it is necessary: A. Appoint the most responsible and experienced Party workers to serve as editors, and they must work practically in the newspaper office. B. The Party Committee should give the newspaper editorial department general instructions and directions, but do not interfere with the daily trivial work of the editorial department. C. Military censorship should be strictly limited to the scope of combat issues and military organizational issues.

(5) One of the most important tasks of Party and Soviet newspapers is to expose various crimes of officials and agencies, and point out the mistakes and shortcomings of Party and Soviet organizations. All these must be done with solemn truthfulness and comradely tone.

Those personnel and agencies whose actions are mentioned in the newspaper must make a factual correction in the same newspaper in a short period of time, or point out the correction of shortcomings and errors. If there is no such correction and acknowledgement, the revolutionary court will prosecute the personnel and agencies designated.

(6) Provincial newspapers should pay attention to their large mass readership. Therefore: Firstly, it should be lively and popular in its reports. Secondly, it should reflect the lives of workers, peasants, and Red Army soldiers in the newspaper. Newspapers should pay great attention to military life (including the front and rear), Party life, as well as the women's movement and the youth movement.

(7) The central organ newspaper should pay special attention to the issue of Party building. It should regularly inform the entire Party of the entire Party life, guide the provincial newspapers, and so on.

(8) The Congress believes that there can be no sound and strong Party and Soviet construction without good newspapers. The Congress proposes to all Party organizations to select the most determined, hardworking and loyal personnel to serve the newspapers.

　　联共八次大会关于报纸的决议
    （一九一九年三月）
    （一）国内战争时期党的工作的一般削弱，最有害地影响了党报和苏维埃报纸的状况。差不多一切我们的党的和苏维埃的期刊之一般缺点——脱离地方的——而不少甚至脱离一般的政治生活。省的党报和苏维埃报差不多完全不报道地方生活，而一般问题的材料选择得极不确当。发表着冗长乏味的文章，而不以简短清楚的语言写的文章去反映一般生活和当地生活的最重要问题。有时整整几页印着文件，而不以简单明了的语言叙述其中最重要之处。发表着各机关的指令决议的全文，而不从这些材料中去编成地方生活的生动的社会记事。
    （二）所有这些缺点，在很大程度上是由于党的最好的著作的力量去做国家工作了，而报纸在大多数情形下落于很少经验的工作人员手中。
    （三）大会认为地方组织应立即采取方法来健全党报和苏维埃报纸，大会促使同志们记着：报纸是宣传、鼓动、组织的最有力的工具，不可代替的影响最广大群众的手段。
    （四）为着改善党和苏维埃的报纸，必需：Ａ、指定最负责最有经验的党的工作人员担任编辑，他们必须实际地在报馆中工作。Ｂ、党委应该给报纸编辑部以一般的指令和指示，可是不要干涉编辑部的日常工作琐事。Ｃ、军事检查应严格限于作战问题和军事组织性问题的范围内。
    （五）党和苏维埃报纸，最重要任务之一——揭露在职人员和机关之各种犯罪行为，指出党和苏维埃组织的错误和缺点。所有这些，必须以严正的实事求是和同志的语调出之。
    被报纸上说到其行动的人员和机关，必须在短时期由在同一报上加以实事求是的更正，或指出关于缺点与错误之改正。如果没有这种更正和承认，革命法庭即控诉被指明的人员和机关。
    （六）省报应注意其极大的群众读者。因此：它第一、应该生动和通俗的报道。第二、应在报上反映工农和红军士兵的生活。报纸应对军队生活（包括前方和后方）、党的生活、以及妇女运动与青年运动加以极大的注意。
    （七）中央机关报应该特别注意党的建设问题。它应该经常使全党知道整个党的生活，指导各省报纸等等。
    （八）大会认为没有很好的报纸，就不能有健全的坚强的党和苏维埃建设。大会向一切党的组织提议，选拔最坚定努力和忠实的工作人员，来为报纸服务。
