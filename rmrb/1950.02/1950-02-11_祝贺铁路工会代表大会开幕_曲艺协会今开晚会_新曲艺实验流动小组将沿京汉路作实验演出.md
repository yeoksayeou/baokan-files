[This City News] The Preparatory Committee of the Chinese Quyi Improvement Association, in order to celebrate the opening of the Chinese Railway Trade Union Congress and closely coordinate with the trade union's cultural activities, has, in addition to presenting a banner to the Railway Trade Union Congress as a tribute, sent 605 congratulatory letters to the national regional delegations and all representatives. It is also scheduled to organize a small new quyi evening party at the Beijing Hotel at 8:00 PM on February 11 to entertain the representatives attending the Railway Trade Union Congress. The selected programs will mainly praise the heroic and exemplary deeds of workers and will be performed by members of the Beijing Quyi Guild.

The congratulatory letter briefly stated: "In the new China of the people, you continue to carry forward the glorious great fighting spirit of 'February 7th' and have taken on the important task of ensuring the realization of the Ministry of Railways' 1950 transportation and construction plan. We, the national quyi workers, are learning from your strong will to be responsible to the people and will use various folk art forms to serve you directly, sing praises of your great deeds in construction, and spread them among the broad masses. We propose the slogan 'You build the railways, we sing the new quyi there.' In order to realize this slogan, we are cooperating with the Cultural and Educational Department of the Chinese Railway Trade Union and the Distribution Department of the North China Xinhua Bookstore General Branch to organize a short, lean, and professional 'New Quyi Experimental Mobile Group.' It plans to conduct experimental performances mainly for railway workers in the spring along the Beijing-Hankou Railway at various large and small stations such as Baoding, Shijiazhuang, Handan, Xinxiang, Zhengzhou, and Hankou; promote popular reading materials; delve deeply into the workers and peasants to collect a large number of labor hero and model deeds among the workers, to provide valuable materials for creating 'quyi lyrics' and 'scripts'; and mobilize folk artists along the line to establish working relationships with the trade union branches and Xinhua bookstores in various regions. In the process of conducting experimental work, we hope that the railway worker brothers in various regions will provide timely guidance so that the development of quyi improvement work and trade union cultural movements, and the distribution of popular reading materials, can achieve new experiences and creations in cooperation."

　　祝贺铁路工会代表大会开幕
    曲艺协会今开晚会
    新曲艺实验流动小组将沿京汉路作实验演出
    【本市讯】中国曲艺改进协会筹委会为了庆祝中国铁路工会代表大会的开幕，密切配合工会文艺活动。除向铁路工代大会献赠锦旗致敬外，并向全国各区代表团及全体代表发出贺信六百○五件；又定于二月十一日下午八点在北京饭店组织新曲艺小型晚会招待出席铁路工会代表大会的代表，所选节目以歌颂工人的英雄模范事迹为主，由北京市曲艺公会会员演出。
    贺信略称：“在人民的新中国里，你们继续发挥了光荣的“二七”伟大战斗精神，负起了保证实现铁道部一九五○年运输与修建计划的重任，我们全国曲艺工作者，学习你们为人民负责的坚强意志，要运用多种多样的民间艺术形式为你们直接服务，歌颂你们在建设中的伟大事迹，并使之传播到广大群众中去。我们提出“你们把铁道修建到那里，我们把新曲艺演唱到那里”的口号。为了实现这一口号，我们正在协同中国铁路工会文教部、华北新华书店总分店发行部，组织一个短小精干的职业性的“新曲艺实验流动小组”，拟在春季沿京汉铁路的保定、石家庄、邯郸、新乡、郑州、汉口等大小各站，以面向铁道工人为主作实验演出；推销大众读物；深入到工农群众中去，大量搜集工人中的劳动英雄模范事迹，以供创作‘曲艺唱词’‘剧本’的宝贵材料，并发动沿线民间艺人与各地区工会新华书店分店取得工作联系。在进行实验工作中，希望各区铁路工人兄弟们，及时指导，使开展曲艺改进工作与工会文艺运动、大众读物发行，获得合作的新经验和创造。”
