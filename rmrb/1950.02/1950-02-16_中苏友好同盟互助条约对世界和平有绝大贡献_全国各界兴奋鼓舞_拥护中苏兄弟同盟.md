　　The Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance Makes a Great Contribution to World Peace
    People from All Walks of Life Across the Country Are Excited, Inspired and Support the Sino-Soviet Brotherly Alliance

    The Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance and its various agreements have been formally signed. This is a concrete manifestation of cooperation and mutual assistance between the two major democratic and peace-loving countries of China and the Soviet Union. It is also the most significant and greatest diplomatic achievement of China since it had foreign relations. This is truly enough to make the Chinese people jubilant and inspired.
    We believe that the Soviet Union is a bulwark for the struggle for world peace and people's democracy, and is the most reliable friend of the Chinese people. Chairman Mao once gave this instruction: "If there were no Soviet Union... could we have won? Obviously not. After victory, could we consolidate it? It would also be impossible." Under the leadership of Chairman Mao, the Chinese people strengthened the dear friendship between the Chinese and Soviet people in action, and expanded the anti-imperialist front headed by the Soviet Union in action, which resulted in the complete victory of the People's Liberation War. Today, China is basically unified, the people's own government has been established, and the construction of New China has begun. The formal signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance and its various agreements today enables China to embark on the road of construction in great strides, making the victory of our Chinese People's Liberation War as solid as a rock.
    The formal signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance and its various agreements not only helps the construction of our New China, and not only consolidates the unity of the Chinese and Soviet people, but also makes a great contribution to the lasting peace of the world. The Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance, in its preamble, states that the two countries are determined to strengthen the friendship and cooperation between the People's Republic of China and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, jointly prevent the resurgence of Japanese imperialism and the re-aggression by Japan or other countries that may collaborate with Japan in aggression in any form, and are eager to consolidate lasting peace and universal security in the Far East and the world in accordance with the purposes and principles of the United Nations Organization. Premier Zhou's speech at the signing ceremony made it even clearer: "Because China and the Soviet Union are working together for peace, justice and universal security, this cooperation not only represents the interests of the people of China and the Soviet Union, but also represents the interests of all peace-loving and just people in the East and the world." He also said: "I believe that those who support our treaty and agreements will not only be the people of China and the Soviet Union, but also the progressive mankind of the whole world, and those who hate these treaties and agreements are only those imperialists and war-mongers." Let us recall how those imperialists and their lackeys have fabricated and spread all kinds of bizarre rumors since Chairman Mao and Premier Zhou visited Moscow one after another, which is enough to fully expose how panicked those imperialists are about the unity and cooperation between China and the Soviet Union! In this new era of Sino-Soviet friendship and cooperation, we Chinese people shout:
    Long live Mao Zedong!
    Long live Stalin!
    Long live Sino-Soviet friendship and cooperation!

　　中苏友好同盟互助条约对世界和平有绝大贡献
    全国各界兴奋鼓舞  拥护中苏兄弟同盟
    谭平山
    中苏友好同盟互助条约及其各种协定，已经正式签字了，这是中苏两大爱好民主和平的国家，实行合作与互助的具体表现，也是中国自有对外关系以来最重大最伟大的一次外交成就，这真足以使我们中国人民欢欣鼓舞的。
    我们认为苏联是争取世界和平与人民民主的堡垒，是中国人民最可靠的友人，毛主席曾有这样的指示：“假如没有苏联的存在，……我们能够胜利么？显然是不能的。胜利了，要巩固，也不可能。”我们中国人民在毛主席领导之下，在行动上加强中苏人民的亲爱的友谊，在行动上扩大以苏联为首的反帝国主义战线，结果能够使人民解放战争获得彻底的胜利。今日中国基本上已统一了，人民自己的政府已建立了，新中国的建设已开始了。今日中苏友好同盟互助条约及其各种协定的正式签订，使今后的中国已能大踏步走上了建设的大道，使我们中国人民解放战争的胜利，更如磐石之固了。
    中苏友好同盟互助条约及其各种协定的正式签订，不仅是帮助了我们新中国的建设，不仅是巩固了中苏人民的团结，且对于世界的持久和平有绝大的贡献。中苏友好同盟互助条约，开宗明义，就说明中苏两国具有决心以加强中华人民共和国与苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟之间的友好与合作，共同防止日本帝国主义之再起及日本或其他用任何形式在侵略行为上与日本相勾结的国家之重新侵略，亟愿依据联合国组织的目标和原则，巩固远东和世界的持久和平与普遍安全。周总理在签字式上的演说，更明白说：“由于中苏两国是为和平，正义与普遍安全而携手合作的，所以这种合作不仅是代表中苏两国人民的利益，同时也是代表东方和世界上一切爱好和平与正义的人民的利益”。又说：“我相信拥护我们的条约和协定的，将不只是中苏人民，而且将是全世界的进步人类，而仇恨这些条约和协定的不过是那些帝国主义者，那些战争贩子。”我们试回想自从毛主席和周总理先后访问莫斯科以来，那些帝国主义者及其走狗，怎样制造和散布各式各样的离奇怪诞的谣言，就足以充分暴露那些帝国主义者对于中苏两国的团结和合作，怎样惊慌失措！我们中国人民在这个中苏友好和合作的新时代中，高呼：
    毛泽东万岁！
    斯大林万岁！
    中苏友好合作万岁！
