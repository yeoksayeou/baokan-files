　　Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 15th: Liao Chengzhi, Chairman of the All-China Democratic Youth Federation, issued a statement on the signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance and other agreements, saying:
    The signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance and two agreements on February 14, 1950, is the most exciting event of 1950. This is a strong manifestation of the great friendly nation, socialist Soviet Union's sincere friendship towards the People's Republic of China.
    The signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance marks the further close unity of the two great nations of China and the Soviet Union and the close cooperation of the 700 million people of China and the Soviet Union. This unity and cooperation is a strong guarantee of world peace. It will further strengthen the world peace and democracy camp, effectively combat the imperialist schemes to enslave the people of the world and launch aggressive wars, and encourage the struggle of oppressed nations for freedom and liberation.
    The Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance creates unprecedentedly favorable conditions for our country to carry out New Democratic construction. With the help of the great Soviet Union, our people have obtained the most reliable guarantee and can steadily build a new China, industrialize the country, and improve the people's living standards and cultural levels, so that our youth can obtain a better and richer life more quickly. What an exciting event this is!
    Therefore, when celebrating this great event, the youth of our country must first thank the great friendly nation, the Soviet Union, and its leader, Marshal Stalin, for their just and sincere friendship and help. At the same time, we must also thank the great leader of our people, Chairman Mao Zedong, who has accomplished a work of great historical significance for the people of our country in Moscow. All members of the All-China Democratic Youth Federation should actively learn from the Soviet Union, redouble our efforts to restore and develop production, and work with the people of the whole country to build a prosperous and happy new China.

    中苏七亿人民亲密合作有力打击侵略战争阴谋
    全国各界兴奋鼓舞  拥护中苏兄弟同盟
    【新华社北京十五日电】中华全国民主青年联合总会主席廖承志为中苏友好同盟互助条约及其他协定的签订发表谈话称：
    一九五○年二月十四日，中苏两国在莫斯科签订友好同盟互助条约和两个协定。这是一九五○年第一件最令人兴奋的大事。这是伟大友邦社会主义苏联对中华人民共和国真挚友谊的强烈的表现。
    中苏友好同盟互助条约的签订，标志着中苏两大民族进一步的紧密团结，标志着中苏两国七万万人民的亲密的合作。这种团结合作是世界和平的有力保证，它将更加加强世界和平民主阵营，有力的打击帝国主义企图奴役世界人民发动侵略战争的阴谋，并鼓舞被压迫民族争取自由解放的斗争。
    中苏友好同盟互助条约，为我国展开新民主主义建设，造成空前有利的条件。在伟大的苏联帮助之下，我国人民获得了最可靠的保障，可以稳步地建设新中国，使国家工业化，并提高人民的生活水平和文化水平，使我们青年能更快地得到一个美好和丰盛的生活。这是多么令人振奋的一件大事。
    因此，在庆祝这个伟大的事件的时候，我们全国青年首先要感谢伟大友邦苏联及其领袖斯大林大元帅，感谢他们这种正义，真诚的友谊和帮助。同时我们还要感谢我国人民的伟大领袖毛泽东主席，他在莫斯科为我国人民完成了一件有极大历史意义的工作。我们中华全国民主青年联合总会的全体会员，应当积极地向苏联学习，加倍努力，恢复和发展生产，与全国人民一起，建设一个富强幸福的新中国。
