　　Northeast Military Region Directs Troops
    Combine Training with Production
    Complete Three-Month Grain Self-Sufficiency Task
    [Our Newspaper News] In order to thoroughly implement and execute Chairman Mao's instructions on the army participating in production, the Northeast Military Region issued instructions on agricultural production for troops in 1950 on the 15th of last month.

    The instructions stipulated: The guiding principle for army production is to combine production with training, focusing on agriculture and supplementing it with sideline occupations, and to participate in some industrial and mining production where possible. It is necessary to strictly abide by government laws and policies and prohibit commercial transactions. Units above the regiment level should establish production committees at all levels to grasp the guiding principles and policies of production. The general production task is to complete the three-month grain task of the unit; organs and schools without this task should engage in sideline production as much as possible without affecting education and work. Implement a production profit-sharing system. Those engaged in production in North Manchuria must complete education, organization, farm tools, seeds, and fertilizer preparations by the end of March; South Manchuria must complete them by mid-February. Those engaged in on-site production must arrive at the site before Grain Rain (April 20).

    After receiving the military region's instructions, all troops formulated production plans based on the specific circumstances of their units and actively carried out various preparations. For example, a certain regiment planned to reclaim 5,000 mu of wasteland and plant 945 mu of vegetables. Another regiment, based on its location, decided to solve two months' worth of grain through agriculture and one month's worth through fishing. Some units, in order to overcome difficulties, opened their own blacksmith shops to manufacture various farm tools. The broad masses of soldiers were jubilant and determined to complete the great production task.
    [Another Dispatch] The Suiyuan-Eastern Military Sub-district of the North China Military Region held a 1950 spring production conference at the beginning of last month, issuing a call for accumulating fertilizer in winter to prepare for spring plowing. The Independent Battalion immediately responded by launching a manure-collecting movement. The first squad of the third company now collects more than five loads of manure every day, collecting more than 1,000 jin of manure in one week, and driving the entire company to accumulate more than 4,000 jin of fertilizer.

　　东北军区指示各部队
    结合练兵进行生产
    完成三个月粮食自给任务
    【本报讯】为彻底贯彻与执行毛主席对军队参加生产的指示，东北军区于上月十五日发出关于一九五○年部队农业生产指示。
    指示规定：军队生产的方针是生产结合练兵，以农业为主，副业为辅，并根据可能，参加部分工矿业生产。要严格遵守政府法令政策，禁止从事商业买卖。团以上单位，均成立各级生产委员会，掌握生产方针与政策。生产任务一般的要完成本单位三个月粮食任务；无此任务之机关学校，在不影响教育与工作原则下，尽量从事副业生产。实行生产分红制。在北满生产者须于三月底完成教育、组织、农具、种子、肥料等准备工作；南满须于二月中旬完成。在现场生产者，一律于谷雨（四月二十日）前到达现场。
    各部队于接到军区指示后，都根据本单位具体情况订出生产计划，积极展开各种准备工作。如某团计划开荒五千亩，种菜九百四十五亩，另有某团根据驻地情况，确定以农业解决两个月粮食，以渔业解决一个月粮食。有的单位为了克服困难，就自己开设铁匠炉，制造各种农具。广大战士们欢欣鼓舞，决心完成伟大生产任务。
    【又讯】华北军区绥东军分区于上月初召开一九五○年春季大生产会议，提出冬季积肥准备春耕的号召。独立营马上响应掀起拾粪运动。三连一班现每天拾粪五担多，一星期就拾下大粪一千多斤，并带动全连积肥四千多斤。
