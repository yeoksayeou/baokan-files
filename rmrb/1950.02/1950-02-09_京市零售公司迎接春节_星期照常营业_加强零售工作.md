　　Beijing Retail Company Prepares for Spring Festival
    Open as Usual on Sundays; Strengthens Retail Work
    [Beijing News] In order to welcome the Spring Festival and ensure that citizens can universally purchase essential goods, the Beijing Retail Company has strengthened its retail work. The company has fully prepared a large quantity of goods such as grain, cloth, coal, and salt, and has added many grain varieties such as rice, naked oats, and small red beans. To avoid crowding when citizens purchase grain, in addition to transferring cadres to strengthen operations, the business hours of each retail store have been extended by half an hour, with sales continuing until 5:00 PM every day. Regular Sunday holidays before the Spring Festival will also be open as usual. In addition, in order to facilitate the purchase of grain by staff members and their families in government agencies, organizations, and educational institutions, those who come to purchase with an introduction letter from their organization can be sold a month's worth of grain.
