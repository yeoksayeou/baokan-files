　　Preliminary Reinforcement of the Jinghan Railway Yellow River Bridge
    Train Speed Increased Eightfold Ministry of Railways Designing Further Reinforcement Project
    [Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 7th] The speed of trains on the famous Jinghan Railway Yellow River Bridge has increased from 5 kilometers per hour to 15 kilometers per hour due to preliminary reinforcement work, and the traction force has also doubled. The bridge was built in 1900, with a speed limit of 20 kilometers per hour and a warranty period of 15 years. During the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, the railway bureau did not maintain the bridge, claiming that the warranty period had expired. Due to years of disrepair, the steel rails on the bridge were in disarray, the screws were loose, the sleepers were warped, and the steel rails were not straight, resulting in extremely low traffic efficiency. After liberation, the local railway staff followed old habits and did not improve the situation. Trains needed to be transported in two stages using small locomotives from the north to the south bank of the Yellow River, traveling slowly at 5 kilometers per hour, taking a total of three hours. In November of last year, the Ministry of Railways of the Central People's Government hired a bridge inspection team composed of Soviet experts to conduct on-site surveys and precise calculations. The results showed that the bridge could still be used. If reinforced and properly maintained, the load-bearing capacity could be increased, and the speed of trains on the bridge could be improved. The Ministry of Railways immediately ordered the Zhengzhou Railway Administration to carry out preliminary reinforcement work. From December 27th of last year to January 4th of this year, the bureau carried out preliminary reinforcement work. After the completion of the project, three test runs were conducted. The last test run used two small locomotives in tandem to pull an entire train of 1,270 tons at one time, and the bridge crossing time was 13 minutes (equivalent to 15 kilometers per hour). The bridge showed no abnormalities. In this way, the train only needs 22 minutes from the north bank to the south bank of the Yellow River, which is about seven or eight times more efficient than the three hours it took in the past. The improvement of this bridge shows that the bureaucratic style and technological conservatism in the current railway work urgently need to be overcome. The Ministry of Railways is now designing further reinforcement projects to further increase the load-bearing capacity and speed of the bridge.

　　京汉路黄河铁桥初步加固
    列车过桥速率加快八倍  铁道部正设计进一步完成加固工程
    【新华社北京七日电】著名的京汉路黄河铁桥的行车速度，由于初步进行了加固工作，已由时速五公里提高到十五公里，牵引力亦提高一倍。该桥建造于一九○○年，当时行车速度限为每小时二十公里，保固期限为十五年。国民党反动统治时期，以保固期限已过，路局即不加以养护。该桥因年久失修，桥上钢轨庞杂，螺丝松动，枕木歪斜，钢轨不直，行车效率极低。该桥解放后，当地铁路工作人员因循旧习，未予改善。列车自黄河北岸至南岸需用小型机车分两次运送，徐行时速五公里，共需时三小时。去年十一月，中央人民政府铁道部聘请苏联专家组成的桥梁视察团到现场勘察，并进行精密计算，结果判明该桥仍可继续使用，如加固后注意养护，则更可增加载重能力，提高桥上行车速度。铁道部随即命令郑州铁路管理局进行初步加固工程。自去年十二月二十七日至今年一月四日，该局进行了初步加固工作，工程完成后曾三次试车，最后一次用两台小型机车重联一次牵引整列车一千二百七十吨，过桥时间为十三分钟（合时速十五公里），桥梁无异状。如此，列车自黄河北岸至南岸只需二十二分钟，比过去需要三小时的效率提高了约七、八倍。此次该桥之改善，说明目前铁道工作中，官僚主义作风和技术上的保守主义是急需克服的。现铁道部正设计进一步的加固工程，使该桥载重量与行车速度得以更加提高。
