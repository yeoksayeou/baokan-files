Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, February 17th: People from all walks of life in the Central South region are celebrating the signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance. More than 1,200 representatives from all walks of life in Wuhan held a celebration meeting on the 15th. Lin Biao, Chairman of the Central South Military and Political Committee, Vice Chairman Zhang Nanxian, and committee members Li Da, Chen Jingshu, and Pan Zinian attended the meeting. Soviet citizens residing in Wuhan, such as Baolici and Maluotuo, were also invited to attend. Chairman Lin Biao pointed out in his speech that the signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance is very beneficial for preventing the resurgence of Japanese aggression forces, guaranteeing peace in the Far East and the world, and guaranteeing China's construction under peaceful conditions. It proves the great proletarian internationalist spirit of the Soviet people towards the Chinese people, proves the concern of Marshal Stalin for the Chinese people, and also proves the correctness of Chairman Mao's "leaning to one side" foreign policy. The people of Central South should support the signing of this treaty with practical actions and use the favorable conditions of this treaty to speed up our construction. Vice Chairman Zhang Nanxian and committee members Li Da and Chen Jingshu enthusiastically praised the equal and mutually beneficial spirit of friendship of this treaty, and explained that only the Soviet Union, with its high degree of proletarian internationalism, can provide such unconditional and sincere assistance to the Chinese people. Wuhan Mayor Wu Defeng and Zhang Pinghua, representative of the Wuhan Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, expressed their enthusiastic support for the signing of the treaty. Zhang Pinghua also called on all Communist Party members and people from all walks of life in the city to study the treaty well and widely publicize and explain it. Hua Yuqing, representative of the China Democratic National Construction Association, Zhang Fukang, representative of the Hubei Provincial Branch of the Chinese Peasants and Workers Democratic Party, Zhou Huanzhang, representative of the Wuhan Branch of the Chinese Association of Scientific Workers, He Yingcai, representative of the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, and Li Dongqing, representative of the Women's Federation, also spoke successively.

    The people of Changsha were caught up in revelry. More than 1,000 workers, staff, and students immediately poured into the streets after hearing the news, and the sound of firecrackers and gongs and drums resounded everywhere. Professors in their forties and fifties participated in the Yangko dance. People from all walks of life have expressed their feelings. Kong Shidie, an old farmer in the suburbs, said after hearing about the Soviet loan to our country: We Chinese have tea to repay the loan, and we must do a good job in tea production this year. Guo Weicheng, Director of the Hengyang Railway Administration, said: China's railways will be rapidly restored and developed with the help of Soviet experts. We will humbly learn from Soviet experts.
