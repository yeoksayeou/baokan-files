　　Has the nature of Chinese society changed now?
    The answer to this question is as follows.
    After we basically defeated the Kuomintang reactionaries and achieved a nationwide victory, the nature of Chinese society has basically changed or is rapidly changing. That is to say, it is changing from the previous semi-feudal and semi-colonial Chinese society to a new democratic society. However, this can only be said to be a basic change, not a complete change. It is said that it has basically changed because the fundamental issue of the revolution is the issue of political power. Once political power is transferred from the Kuomintang reactionaries to the people, the past semi-colonial status begins to end, and the semi-feudal situation will also change rapidly. For example, after the people, under the leadership of the Communist Party, achieve victory, they will thoroughly destroy the Kuomintang's reactionary rule, establish a people's democratic dictatorship, confiscate bureaucratic capital, implement rent reduction and interest reduction, land reform, and abolish certain political and economic privileges of imperialism in China. It cannot be said that it has completely changed because the thorough change of the entire social nature will ultimately depend on the development of national social and economic conditions. China's current economic form is still an individual and scattered agricultural and handicraft economy, accounting for about 90% of the total economy, and in the rural economy, there are still 320 million people in areas where land reform has not been implemented, and feudal land relations still exist. Before these situations are changed, it cannot be said that the nature of the entire Chinese society has completely changed.

　　现在中国社会性质是否已经改变？
    这个问题的答复如下。
    在我们基本上打垮了国民党反动派，取得全国性的胜利以后，中国社会性质基本上是已改变了或在迅速改变中，这就是说从以前半封建半殖民地的中国社会，改变为新民主主义的社会。但这只能说是基本上改变了而不能说是完全改变了。说它是基本上改变了，是因为革命的根本问题是政权问题，政权一旦从国民党反动派方面转入人民手里，过去半殖民地的地位就开始结束，半封建的情况也就会要迅速改变。如人民在共产党领导下取得胜利后，即彻底摧毁国民党的反动统治，建立人民民主专政，没收官僚资本，实行减租减息、土地改革，及取消帝国主义在中国政治的经济的某些特权等。不能说它完全改变了，是因为整个社会性质的彻底改变将最后取决于全国社会经济条件的发展。中国现在的经济形态，还是个体的分散的农业与手工业经济，占全部经济比重中的百分之九十左右，并且在农村经济中，还有三万万二千万人口的地区没有实行土地改革，还存在着封建的土地关系。在没有改变这些情况之前，是不能够说全中国社会性质已经完全改变了。
