　　Hebei Grain Bureau Inspection of Wheat Warehouses
    Finds Multiple Cases of Mold, Rot, and Insect Damage
    [This Newspaper's Report] In order to prevent grain from spoiling and to strengthen the management of grain depots, the Hebei Provincial Grain Bureau conducted a key inspection of wheat warehouses in January of this year. The Xinji Grain Depot in Shijiazhuang, the Gaocheng Grain Depot, and others, had previously discovered instances of stored wheat heating up and spoiling in November of last year. At that time, the provincial bureau had already instructed grain depots at all levels to conduct inspections; however, warehouse cadres in various locations, based on their narrow experience, believed that grain would not spoil in winter, and their inspections of wheat warehouses were generally not thorough. Therefore, the provincial bureau dispatched nine cadres in January of this year and notified twelve cadres who were originally working in various districts to assist in the work, focusing on key inspections of grain depots in each special district. They consciously inspected warehouses that were not thought to be susceptible to spoilage. In less than half a month of inspection, it was discovered that warehouses in various locations had, to varying degrees, exhibited signs of heating, and a significant number of stored grains were damaged. For example, in the Baoding Special District, out of thirty-two wheat warehouses, thirteen were inspected, and seven were found to have mold, rot, and insect infestation, resulting in the damage of six or seven hundred catties of grain. In the Tongxian Special District, eight warehouses were inspected, and four were found to have spoilage, resulting in the loss of nearly a thousand catties of grain. In the Dingxian Special District, seventy-four grain depots were inspected, and fourteen were found to have spoilage, resulting in the loss of more than 17,000 catties of grain. The Handan Special District suffered the greatest losses, with all nineteen grain warehouses inspected found to have spoilage, resulting in the loss of more than 20,000 catties of grain. In the Tangshan Special District, nine warehouses were inspected, and all were found to have spoilage. Because some responsible cadres were afraid of being criticized, they mixed spoiled grain into good grain, which resulted in damage to more than 30,000 catties of grain. More than 3,000 catties of this was so damaged that it was inedible. In the Xingtai Special District, thirteen out of fifteen warehouses inspected were found to have spoilage, with a total of more than 50,000 catties of grain spoiled. In the Tianjin Special District, three out of six grain warehouses were found to have spoilage, resulting in the loss of nearly 30,000 catties, although most of it was still usable. The above figures are preliminary statistics. Other figures that have already been processed but not reported are not included.

　　河北粮食局检查麦库
    发现粮食霉烂虫蚀多起
    【本报讯】河北省粮食局，为防止各地粮食霉坏，加强粮库保管，特于今年一月间，进行麦库重点检查。石家庄辛集粮库、藁城等粮库，去年十一月间均曾先后发现库存小麦发热及霉坏现象。当时省局已指示各级粮库进行检查；但各地仓库干部，根据狭隘经验认为冬季不坏粮，对麦库检查一般均不深入。因此，省局复于今年一月间派出干部九人，并通知原在各区协助工作的干部十二人配合工作，着重进行对各专区粮库的重点检查。更有意识地检查人们认为不致霉坏的仓库。在不及半月的检查中，已发现各地仓库，或多或少均有发热现象，存粮损坏者为数亦多。如保定专区有麦库三十二处，检查十三处，即有七处发现霉烂和生虫，损坏粮食六、七百斤。通县专区检查了八个仓房，有四个发生坏粮现象，损失粮食近千斤。定县专区检查了七十四个粮库，发生坏粮者有十四个，损失粮食一万七千多斤。邯郸专区损失最大，检查十九个粮仓均有坏粮，损失粮食二万多斤。唐山专区检查九个仓库，也是仓仓都有坏粮。由于有些负责干部怕受批评，将坏粮掺入好粮，因而又使三万多斤粮食遭受损害。其中损坏而不能吃者有三千余斤。邢台专区检查仓库十五处就有十三处坏的，共坏粮五万多斤。天津专区六个粮仓中，有三个发生坏粮，损失近三万斤，惟大部尚可用。上述数字均系初步统计。其他已经处理而未上报的数字尚未计算在内。
