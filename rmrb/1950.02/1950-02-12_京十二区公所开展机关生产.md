　　Jing No. 12 District Public Office Launches Organ Production
    [Report from this newspaper] The Jing No. 12 District Public Office, responding to the call of the Beijing People's Government, has launched this year's organ production on the basis of last year's savings and production. Last year, the cadres of this district used their spare time to clear garbage and weeds from the courtyard and opened up vegetable gardens. This improved their meals and saved a lot of expenses. In order to respond to the government's call, the district discussed Vice Mayor Zhang Youyu's report on January 14 regarding the conservation and production of organs and groups, and summarized last year's production experience, formulating this year's production plan.
    1. In addition to continuing to expand last year's gardens, they have also applied to the Municipal Government for approval to lease a portion of land in the Temple of Heaven for cultivation. 2. Processing flour milling (a mill has now been prepared). 3. Chopping firewood. They now use their free time after dinner every day, in groups of more than ten people, for more than an hour, and can chop more than two hundred catties of firewood.

　　京十二区公所开展机关生产
    【本报讯】京市十二区公所响应北京人民政府号召，已在去年节约生产的基础上，开展了今年的机关生产。该区干部去年曾利用业余时间清除了院中的垃圾、野草，开辟了菜园。因而改善了伙食，并节省了不少经费。为了响应政府的号召，该区讨论了一月十四日张友渔副市长关于机关团体节约生产的报告，并总结了去年的生产经验，拟定了今年的生产计划。
    一、除继续扩大去年的园地外，并呈请市府批准在天坛内租一部分土地耕种。二、加工磨面（现已筹妥磨房一所）。三、劈劈柴。他们现在每天利用晚饭后的空闲，一组十余人，一个多钟头，可劈柴二百多斤。
