　　"Unbreakable" and "Invincible"
　　--Introducing the Opera "Steel Warrior"
　　Zhou Weizhi
　　I.
　　"Steel Warrior," originally titled "Steel Bones and Iron Tendons," is a collective creation by Comrade Wu Zhaoti and others in Northeast China. It has now been adapted by Comrade Wu Baoguang and others from the Political Department of the Special Forces Corps of the North China Military Region, and renamed "Steel Warrior." It has already been publicly performed at the National Grand Theater. I watched their preview a few days ago and was very moved. I believe it has great educational significance and is worth introducing to everyone. However, I still have some opinions on the play itself. I am writing this based on my impressions during the preview for the reference of the audience and readers. However, they may have made many modifications during this public performance, and some of my opinions may no longer be appropriate. In that case, I will have to wait until I have seen the official performance before making any changes.
　　The play tells the story of a revolutionary soldier who can be called an example in the War of Liberation, fighting bravely and unyieldingly.
　　In 1947, the enemy attacked our Yimeng Mountain area in East China with heavy troops. Zhang Zhijian, the second platoon leader of a certain unit of our army, led his entire platoon to voluntarily request to cover the safe transfer of the command organs, important munitions factories, and granaries. After completing the task, they were surrounded by the enemy on the top of Five Finger Mountain. They fought bloodily for five days and nights, repelling more than ten enemy assaults. Later, due to being outnumbered and running out of ammunition and food, they jumped off the cliff to break through the encirclement. Second Platoon Leader Zhang Zhijian, communications soldier Liu Haiquan, and cook Lao Wang were all captured due to injuries. Qi Degui, a class alien among the soldiers, could not withstand the severe test and surrendered to the enemy. The enemy wanted to interrogate them to find out the location of the buried machinery and grain, to fulfill their so-called "self-defeating" dream. However, Lao Wang scolded Qi Degui's shameless surrender and resisted the enemy's interrogation, sacrificing himself heroically on the spot. The young communications soldier Liu Haiquan did not utter a word despite the enemy's enticements and threats, and cleverly and bravely stabbed the enemy's political work section chief and killed an enemy soldier, dying generously. Second Platoon Leader Zhang Zhijian remained steadfast in court, no matter how severely the enemy tortured him, he remained unyielding. His great heroic spirit moved the enemy soldiers Wei Mingyi and Wang Desheng, who risked their lives to rescue Platoon Leader Zhang and jumped out of the fire pit together to join the People's Liberation Army. After they escaped, they were sheltered by the masses in a small village. The enemy followed closely, using the traitor Qi Degui as an internal agent to scout their whereabouts. Platoon Leader Zhang was unfortunately captured again. Qi Degui willingly served the enemy, pretending to be captured and continuing to scout and persuade Zhang to surrender, but he was also seen through by Platoon Leader Zhang. Finally, the enemy captured his mother and son,妄想想要利用亲骨肉威胁劝降, They didn't expect that the mother of the People's Liberation Army and her own son were just as strong and unyielding. She encouraged her son, exposed the enemy's tricks and traps, and the enemy cruelly beat Zhang platoon leader's son to death, but this did not shake Zhang platoon leader's steel will and firm determination in the slightest.
　　The People's Liberation Army's counter-offensive artillery fire shattered the enemy's dream. Chiang Kai-shek's final struggle and resistance were crushed by the powerful artillery fire of the People's Liberation Army. The traitor Qi Degui perished along with the bandit army. Heroic Platoon Leader Zhang Zhijian victoriously joined forces with the troops, leading the uprising brothers. The entire army admired this incomparably great steel warrior. The entire play ends in enthusiastic singing.
　　II.
　　The merit of this play is that it uses relatively typical characters and profound images to express the noble revolutionary qualities of the People's Liberation Army. Revolutionary soldiers are willing to sacrifice everything, even their own sons, to safeguard the interests of the people. It also shows that war is cruel and complex, and the enemy is insidious and cunning. The victory of the war is achieved not only through thousands of bloody battles, but also because of the resolute and tenacious steel-like revolutionary will unique to the People's Liberation Army, which can repel all enemy attacks and achieve final victory. These points have great educational significance for the audience, especially the urban audience. Because when the People's Liberation Army has already won nationwide victory today, it is easy to forget, or not even know, that it has gone through a very arduous journey. When praising the power and invincibility of the People's Liberation Army, it is not easy to associate it with the great power of Platoon Leader Zhang directly and stubbornly fighting the enemy in that kind of situation, and smashing all the enemy's conspiracies. This is a concentrated expression of the revolutionary qualities of the People's Liberation Army on another battlefield, and it is also a great victory for the People's Liberation Army. It makes people deeply feel that the People's Liberation Army is truly the people's army, fighting for the people, so it is a steel army, and its soldiers are steel soldiers. It truly possesses the "invincible" steel-like strength, and the reason why it is "invincible" is because it possesses the "unbreakable" revolutionary will.
　　Like Zhang Zhijian in "Steel Warrior," and his brave and tenacious soldiers, they used the spirit of great self-sacrifice to voluntarily request to complete arduous and dangerous tasks. After the task was completed, their personal lives were threatened, and their positions would be occupied by the enemy, but their will did not waver, and the ideological position was even more consolidated. Because sacrificing everything for the people is what revolutionary soldiers are always prepared to do, and they anticipated this when accepting the task. Therefore, "death" does not pose any threat to them. What they are thinking about is still how to kill more enemies, until the enemy has broken through the position, and when the enemy and ourselves are fighting hand-to-hand, what Lao Wang is thinking about is how to kill a few more enemies before he sacrifices himself. These soldiers jump off the cliff to break through, also to strive for perhaps the smallest possibility to preserve themselves, so that they can kill more enemies in the future. This is the steel-like tenacious character of steel warriors. This steel-like character is the result of long-term ideological education under the great Communist Party. Many revolutionary peasants have become or are becoming proletarian revolutionary soldiers - Communist Party members. Every soldier takes pride in being a people's hero, and takes pride in being a Communist Party member, because of this, the young communications soldier, at his critical moment, proposed to the Party that after he sacrificed, he should be recognized as a Communist Party member. When the enemy treated him as a child and threatened and enticed him with various means, he cleverly stabbed the enemy's eyes with a pen, and killed the enemy with the enemy's gun, even sacrificing himself heroically. Because of this, Lao Wang would despise the class alien who surrendered to the enemy, and dare to fight the enemy so recklessly, finally dying gloriously and tenaciously. Before they died, they all shouted long live the Communist Party, long live Chairman Mao. These places greatly stirred up the audience's hatred and contempt for the enemy. Also because of this, Zhang platoon leader was able to stand firmly on his own position. He kept in mind what the instructor often said: In addition to thinking about the people anytime and anywhere, the most serious test for a Communist Party member is whether he is truly loyal to the Party, loyal to the revolution, and loyal to the people in difficult and complex environments, on the battlefield, and in the enemy's court. This makes his will as "unbreakable" as steel. The enemy said that no matter whether he was steel or iron, they would burn him into mud, but he was true gold, able to withstand the fire. Whether they beat him, brand him, clamp him with sticks, pour cold water on him, use prison, shackles and handcuffs to torture him for a long time, and at the same time use money, status, and beauty traps to lure him, and deceive him with words such as "the Communist Party and the People's Liberation Army are about to perish," and want him to tell the location of the machinery and grain buried in the munitions factory, he resolutely did not reveal a single detail. In the end, the enemy used his old mother and young son to coerce him, but he still firmly stood on his revolutionary position. For the sake of the people, for the sake of thousands upon thousands of the people's sons, he allowed the enemy to beat his own child to death, without the slightest wavering. The People's Liberation Army, organized and developed by such revolutionary soldiers, is of course "unbreakable" and also "invincible."
　　Therefore, formally, Chiang Kai-shek's political work section chief can arbitrarily beat and kill people, seemingly very impressive. Zhang platoon leader and others were either killed or suffered torture, seemingly disheartening, but in reality, it was Chiang Kai-shek's political work section chief who was panicked and incompetent, and Zhang platoon leader who was steadfast and full of confidence in victory. In the end, it was Chiang Kai-shek's army that failed, and the People's Liberation Army that won. This is the truth, and it is also what this play clearly tells people. This should be said to be the success of the play. The performances of Zhang platoon leader, Lao Wang, and the communications soldier also managed to express three different but identical personalities, that is to say, the will is consistent, but the images expressed are different. Some express fortitude and calmness, some express straightforwardness and boldness, and some appear very clever. This should be said to be the harvest of the actors.
　　III.
　　Some people have raised the question of why Chiang Kai-shek's political work section chief did not kill Zhang platoon leader after repeated failures in interrogation? Is it only for the reward? And why did his superiors insist on not letting Zhang platoon leader be killed, and why did they want him to tell the location of the machinery and grain?
　　Fighting is based on people and weapons. If there are no guns and cannons, or if the supply of guns and bullets cannot keep up, it is impossible to fight. Also, if there are only commanders and fighters, but no food to eat, how can we persevere in the war? If the common people have no food, they cannot survive, how can they support the front line? Without these, we would truly "collapse without being attacked," especially in this large-scale war. The machinery and grain for manufacturing munitions play a very important role strategically, and are also some of the key factors that determine victory or defeat. Therefore, the enemy tries every means to destroy our machinery and grain. Another reason why the enemy attaches importance to this issue is that due to our military-civilian cooperation and perseverance in the struggle, the deeper the enemy enters the liberated area, the longer the communication lines become, and the more difficult various supplies become. Therefore, they want to find supplies of munitions and grain on the spot, but the clues in this regard are not easy to find. Spies, traitors, or surrendered elements cannot solve this problem. These two points are the important reasons why the enemy did not kill Zhang platoon leader but used every means to make him tell the location of the machinery and grain buried, and it is also the basis for why Zhang platoon leader, Lao Wang, and Xiao Liu resolutely did not tell the truth. This issue is written in the script, but lacks a clear and profound explanation, so that the audience's impression of the machinery and grain is only a kind of ordinary material, which does not have a great impact on the war. Therefore, they would doubt why Zhang platoon leader was not killed, but was able to "survive" until the time of victory. This is where the script should be strengthened. I think that in order to show the enemy's continuous persecution of Zhang platoon leader, we should reveal in appropriate places our army's attacks on the enemy, eliminating his troops, and harassing his supply lines, so that in his temporary "advance," he not only does not establish confidence in victory, but deepens his panic. Also because of this, he more and more fiercely threatens Zhang platoon leader, destroying the potential ability to support the war. In this way, on the one hand, we can explain the great power of the People's Liberation Army and the masses, and also make the development of the drama more grounded, so as not to make the enemy's process of dealing with Zhang platoon leader too flat, almost using one method and then changing to another, which seems a bit repetitive, and cannot become tighter and tighter, gradually increasing the audience's hatred for the enemy and respect for the hero. For example, Zhang platoon leader's torn clothes and blood stains, when first seen, completely make people think of his situation of jumping off the cliff and being injured, and being tortured, and he is so loyal and steadfast, which is very moving, but due to repeated interrogations, appearing back and forth, the impression is not deep. It was not until the scene where the enemy wanted to kill his son that the audience's emotions became more excited.
　　IV.
　　The description and performance of the negative characters should take a serious and solemn attitude, strengthening their insidious and vicious performance. Their internal decadent and corrupt life is easy to write in a general way, without any profound significance. Writing too much about male and female relationships will attract the audience's attention to these ambiguous relationships, diluting the positive effect of the theme. Of course, this does not mean that we should not expose their mental state before the collapse, but that we should write about the essence of them, write about their brutality and selfishness, write about their fear of the people, write about their lack of future, and write about their crazy psychology (some people say that the Chiang Kai-shek image they used in the play is too impressive, which is inappropriate). Irony can be used, such as the image of the enemy's political work section chief wearing bandages after being stabbed and injured, and writing about their panic when the enemy is approaching is very good, but it is too superficial to exaggerate it too much, to make them clowns, and to emphasize their performance of crawling under the table, or falling into the river when crossing the river.
　　Qi Degui, who came from a landlord family, opposed the People's Liberation Army due to the contradictory interests of his class, and seeing the strength of Chiang Kai-shek's army, he was greedy for life and afraid of death, and finally surrendered to the enemy, harming our People's Liberation Army cadres and opposing the people. This is possible, realistic, and worthy of vigilance. However, for soldiers from landlord families, it should be explained that our People's Liberation Army's basic policy towards them is to reform them, rather than always being vigilant against soldiers and cadres of this kind of background, and treating them all as spies. This point is not clearly expressed enough in the script. The comrade who plays this role also performs well, and he can express that he is a base villain of a backward class with no future, who can only use tricks, and has no other strength.
　　V.
　　Regarding the relationship between the military and the people, this script does not express the local masses' concern and love for these brave men who persisted in the struggle to protect the machinery and grain. The later part writes that after Zhang platoon leader escaped, he hid in an old farmer's house, but the villagers had a lot of militia strength, but they did nothing and allowed the enemy to enter the village and capture Zhang platoon leader again. These places are very inappropriate. Therefore, I advocate that when the soldiers first persist on the mountain, the scout and an old farmer should come back together, bringing some dry food, and the old farmer should point out the enemy's situation around, telling them that there is only one platoon of enemies on the cliff side, and he can lead the soldiers to jump off the cliff and break through to find the troops. This can express that they are connected by flesh and blood and are invincible. In the first scene of the performance, there is sometimes a feeling of "sadness," which should be stronger. Persist in the war with confidence in victory, believing that the war will definitely be won. Death is prepared for among them, but it is also fighting in order not to die. Don't create a feeling that everyone will die. Small sacrifices will lead to greater victories. The strongest and most persistent people will not die. In this scene, the old farmer can come on stage, report the enemy's situation, explain the direction of the troops' transfer, and lead them to jump off the cliff.
　　VI.
　　In order to better exert the effect of this play, I finally suggest that the author delete the scenes of the beauty trap and the prison break and re-capture, because to test a revolutionary soldier, it is not necessary to use all the methods. Without the beauty trap, Zhang platoon leader's firm will can be fully seen. At the same time, this scene is not written realistically enough, and the enemy's methods seem too simple. How can it make people fall into his trap to suddenly meet a woman who is unfamiliar and flattering him in a gorgeous room with a Zhang platoon leader who has been beaten not long ago, is covered in injuries, and is wearing ragged clothes? The scene about escaping from prison makes people feel like it is ending, but adding several setbacks and being recaptured makes the time drag on too long, which seems unnecessary. There are many lengthy dialogues or lyrics, such as the questions and answers between Qi Degui and the enemy's political work section chief when they first met, some of Zhang platoon leader's monologues in prison, and some unnecessary lines in the first scene, which can be appropriately deleted and selected. Fully describe the more important scenes, such as persisting on the mountain top, the death of Lao Wang and Xiao Liu, the first interrogation, and the scene of seeing his mother and son being killed, so that the script is more concise, and the audience's impression is also more profound. Based on their good style of repeatedly revising the play during rehearsals, with the help of audiences from all sides, this play will be revised better and better, and performed better and better.

　　“坚不可破”与“无坚不摧”
    ——介绍歌剧《钢铁战士》
    周巍峙
    一
    《钢铁战士》原名《钢骨铁筋》，是东北武照题同志等集体创作，现经华北军区特种兵团政治部文工团武宝光等同志加以改编，名为《钢铁战士》，已于国民大戏院举行公演，我于数日前看了他们的预演，很受感动。认为有很大教育意义，值得向大家介绍。但对剧作方面，尚有一点意见，特根据预演时的观感，写出供观众及读者参考。不过他们在此次公演时也许已有不少修改，我的一些意见，也恐怕已不合适，那只好等看过正式公演再修改了。
    该剧是写解放战争中，一个堪称典范的革命军人不屈不挠英勇斗争的故事。
    一九四七年，敌人以重兵进攻我华东沂蒙山区，我军某部二排长张志坚同志带领全排主动要求掩护指挥机关、重要军火工厂及粮库安全转移，任务完成后，被敌人包围在五指山顶，血战五昼夜，击退敌人十几次冲锋，后因寡不敌众弹尽粮绝，跳崖突围；二排长张志坚、通讯员刘海泉、以及炊事员老王均因受伤被俘，阶级异己分子战士齐德贵，经不起严重情况的考验，投降了敌人。敌人为了要从他们嘴里审问出埋藏机器粮食的地方，做他们所谓“不攻自破”的美梦；但老王痛骂齐德贵的无耻劝降，抗拒敌人的审问，当场壮烈牺牲，年幼的通讯员刘海泉任凭敌人利诱威胁，一字不吐，并机智勇敢刺伤敌政工处长，击毙敌士兵，慷慨就义。二排长张志坚在法庭上坚定不移，那怕敌人严刑拷打，始终不屈不挠。他这种伟大的英雄气节感动了敌兵魏明义、王德胜，他们冒着生命危险救出张排长一块跳出火坑，投奔解放军。他们逃出后，为群众掩护在一个小乡村里，敌人紧紧追来，利用叛徒齐德贵做内应侦察行踪，张排长不幸再次被捕。齐德贵甘心事敌，伪装被俘对张排长继续进行侦察劝降，也被张排长识破；最后敌人又将其母、子抓来，妄想利用亲骨肉威胁劝降，他们没想到解放军的母亲和自己的儿子一样，也是坚强不可屈的人，她鼓励着自己的儿子，揭穿了敌人的鬼计圈套，敌人残忍的打死张排长的儿子，但这没有丝毫动摇张排长钢铁的意志，坚定的决心。
    人民解放军反攻的炮声，震破了敌人的迷梦，蒋匪最后的挣扎和顽抗，被解放军强大的炮火所击溃，叛徒齐德贵随着匪军一道灭亡；英雄排长张志坚带着起义的弟兄们胜利的和部队会合了，全军敬佩这伟大无比的钢铁战士，全剧在热烈的歌声中闭幕。
    二
    这个剧的好处是用比较典型的人物与深刻的形象，表现了人民解放军崇高的革命品质，革命军人为了维护人民的利益，不惜牺牲自己的一切，以至自己的儿子。它也说明战争是残酷复杂的，敌人是阴险狡诈的，战争胜利的取得，不仅是经过千百次血战，也由于人民解放军所特有的那种坚决顽强的钢铁般的革命意志，才能打退敌人一切进攻，取得最后胜利。这些地方，对观众，特别是城市观众们有很大的教育意义。因为当人民解放军已在全国胜利的今天，很易忘记，或者根本不知道它曾走过一段非常艰苦的路程；当歌颂人民解放军威力强大，战无不胜时，不易联想到像张排长在那种情况下，直接与敌人顽强斗争，粉碎敌人一切阴谋的伟大威力，这是人民解放军革命品质在另一战场上的集中表现，也是人民解放军的伟大胜利。它使人深刻的感觉到人民解放军真正是人民的部队，为人民而作战，因此它是钢铁的部队，它的战士也就是钢铁的战士。它就真正具有“无坚不摧”的钢铁般的力量，而“无坚不摧”的原因，也就是因为它具有“坚不可破”的革命意志。
    像《钢铁战士》中的张排长，和他的英勇顽强的战士们，就是以伟大自我牺牲的精神，主动要求完成艰巨而危险的任务，在任务完成以后，个人的生命受到威胁，他们的阵地将会被敌占领，但是他们意志并不动摇，思想的阵地更加巩固，因为为人民而牺牲自己一切，是革命军人随时都准备这样做的，在接受任务时，就预料到这一点。因此“死”对他们并没有什么威胁，他们所想的仍是如何更多的杀伤敌人，一直到敌人已突破阵地，敌我肉搏的时候，老王所想到也是在他牺牲前，如何再打死几个敌人，这些战士跳崖突围，也是为了争取也许是最小的可能来保存自己，好在今后更多的杀伤敌人。这就是钢铁战士的钢铁般顽强的性格。这种钢铁般的性格，是长期在伟大的共产党的思想教育下的结果，许多革命的农民已变成或正在变成无产阶级的革命战士——共产党员。每个战士以做人民的英雄为光荣，以做共产党员为光荣，因为这样，年幼的通讯员在他危急的时候，向党提出在他牺牲之后，要承认他是共产党员，而在敌人把他当小孩用各种手段威胁利诱他的时候，他却能机智的用钢笔剌伤敌人的眼睛，用敌人的枪打死敌人，以至自己也壮烈死去。因为这样，老王才会那样蔑视投降敌人的阶级异己分子，敢于那样奋不顾身的去殴打敌人，终于光荣而顽强的死去。他们临死前，都高呼共产党万岁，毛主席万岁。这些地方十分激动观众们对敌人的仇恨与蔑视的心情。也因为这样，张排长才会坚定不移的站稳自己的立场，他紧记着指导员常讲的话：共产党员除了随时随地为人民着想以外，最严重的考验就是在艰苦复杂的环境里、战场上、敌人法庭上，是不是真正忠实于党，忠实于革命，忠实于人民。这就使他的意志像钢铁一样“坚不可破”。敌人说不管他是钢是铁，要把他烧成泥，但他是真金，经得起火炼，无论是打他，烙他，用夹棍夹他，拿凉水灌他，用监牢，脚镣手铐长期的折磨他，同时还用金钱、地位、美人计诱惑他，用“共产党，解放军快要灭亡”的话欺骗他，要他说出军火工厂的机器及粮食埋藏的所在，他却坚决不透露一点实情，敌人最后以他的老母及幼子来要挟他，他仍坚定自己的革命立场，为了人民，为了千千万万人民的儿子，让敌人打死他自己的孩子，没有一点动摇。用这样的革命军人组织起来发展起来的人民解放军，当然是“坚不可破”，而且是“无坚不摧”了。
    因此，形式上，蒋匪的政工处长可以任意的打人杀人，似乎很神气，张排长他们有的被杀，有的遭苦刑，似乎令人气馁，而实际上，恐慌的，无能的，是蒋匪政工处长，坚定不移充满胜利信心的是张排长，最后失败的是蒋匪军，胜利的是人民解放军。这是真理，也是本剧明确告诉人的，这应该说是剧作的成功。张排长、老王、通讯员三人的表演，也还能表现出三种不同而又相同的性格，也就是说意志是一致的，表现的形象却各有不同，有的表现刚毅沉着，有的表现率直豪放，有的则显得十分机灵，这应该说是演员的收获。
    三
    有人提出，蒋匪政工处长在屡次逼供失败后，为何不杀掉张排长？是否仅为了赏金？而他的上级又为何一定不让杀掉张排长，要他说出机器粮食又是为何？
    打仗是依靠人和武器，假使枪炮没有了，或枪弹炮弹接济不上，是无法打仗的。又如仅有指战人员，而无粮可食，怎能坚持战争？老百姓无粮也无法生存下去，怎能支援前线？没有这些真会“不攻自破”的，特别在这种大规模的战争中，制造军火的机器及粮食，在战略上所起作用极大，也是决定胜负的一些重要关键。因此敌人想尽一切办法来破坏我们的机器与粮食。敌人重视这个问题的另一原因，是由于我们军民合作，坚持斗争，敌人进入解放区越深入，交通线越长，各种供给越困难，也就越想就地找到军火与粮食的补给，而这方面的线索很不好找，特务、奸细，或投降分子不能解决这一问题。这两点就是敌人为什么不杀张排长而用尽一切办法来要他说出机器与粮食埋藏所在的重要原因，也就是张排长、老王、小刘为什么坚决不吐实情的根据。这个问题在剧本里写出了，但缺乏明确而深刻的说明，使得观众对于机器与粮食的印象仅是一种普通的物质，对战争影响不大，因此才会怀疑到张排长为什么不被杀害，而能“幸存”下去，一直到胜利的时候。这是剧本应加强的地方。我以为为了表现敌人对张排长不断的迫害，应在适当场所透露出我军对敌人的打击，消灭他的部队，骚扰他的供给线，使他在暂时的“前进”中，不但没有树立起胜利的信心，反而加深了恐慌的情绪。也由于这样，他才越来越凶残的威胁张排长，破坏支持战争的潜在能力。这样一方面可以说明人民解放军及群众的伟大力量，也可使戏剧的发展更有根据，而不致使敌人对付张排长的过程太平铺直叙，差不多是使完一种手段，再换一个办法，显得有些重叠，而不能越逼越紧，逐步提高观众对敌的仇恨与对英雄的尊敬。譬如张排长的破衣血痕，初见时，完全想到他跳崖受伤，苦刑拷打的情况，而他又是那样的忠贞坚定，十分使人感动，但由于屡次拷问，来回出现，印象就不深了，一直到敌人要杀他儿子一场，观众的情绪，才更加激动起来。
    四
    对反派人物的描写与表演，应采取认真严肃的态度，加强他们阴险恶毒的表现，他们内部的颓废腐败生活，很容易写得一般化，没有什么深刻的意义，男女关系写多了，会吸引观众的注意力到这些暧昧的关系上，冲淡主题的积极效果，这当然并不是不要揭露他们在崩溃前的精神状态，而是要写他本质的东西，写他们的凶残自私，写他们对人民的畏惧，写他们没有前途，写他们的疯狂心理（有人说他们演戏用的蒋介石像太神气了，不合适）。讽刺可以用的，如敌政工处长受刺受伤后，挂绷带的形象，写他们在大敌当前时的张惶失措就很好，但过于夸大，小丑化，强调表现他们爬在桌子底下，或过河时跌在河里的表现就太浅薄了。
    地主出身的齐德贵，由于阶级本身利益的矛盾，他反对人民解放军，加上看到蒋匪军的力量大，贪生怕死，终于投降敌人，残害我们解放军干部，反对人民，这是可能的，现实的，也是值得警惕的。但是对地主出身的战士，应说明我们人民解放军对他们的基本政策是改造他，而不是对这类成分的战士及干部，都是处处防范的，都当内奸看的。这一点在剧本中表现得不够明确。演这个角色的同志还演的不错，他能表现出他是一种落后阶级的没有前途的卑鄙小人，只会使使鬼计，而没有其他任何力量。
    五
    关于军民关系方面，这剧本没有表现当地群众对这些为了掩护机器与粮食而坚持斗争的勇士们表示关怀与爱护，后面所写张排长逃出后躲在一老乡家，该村民兵力量不少，却毫无动静的任敌人进村把张排长再次捕去，这些地方都很不合适，因此我主张在第一次战士们坚持山头时，侦察员与一老乡一同回来，带来一些干粮，由老乡指明四周敌情，告诉悬崖方面的敌人只有一个排，他可带战士们跳崖，突围找部队去。这样可以表现的血肉相连，不可战胜。在第一场的表演上，有时有一些“悲”的感觉，应该更壮一些，在胜利的信心中坚持战争，相信战争一定会胜利的，在他们之间死是有准备的，但又是为了不死而在战斗，不要造成一种所有的人都会死的感觉，小的牺牲会获得更大的胜利。最能坚强的，最能坚持到最后的人是不会死的。这一场老乡可上场，报告敌情，说明部队转移方向，领他们跳崖。
  六
    为了更好的发挥本剧的效果，最后我建议作者把美人计及越狱与再次被捕的几场删去，因为考验一个革命军人，不必用完所有的方法，没有美人计已可充分看出张排长坚定的意志，同时这一场写的不够真实，显得敌人的手段也太简单了，把一个被打不久，带着满身伤痕，带着破烂衣服的张排长突然在一间华丽的房间里与一个不相识的而又向他献媚的女人见面，在这种情况下，怎么会使人上他的圈套？关于越狱逃脱一场，颇使人有结束的感觉，而又加上几番挫折，重被捕回，把时间拖的太长，似乎不必要。有不少冗长的对话或唱词，如齐德贵与敌政工处长或第一次见面时的问答，张排长在监狱中一些独白，以及第一场中一些不必要的台词，都可酌予删改，选择。比较重要的几场，如山顶坚持，老王、小刘的死，第一次拷问，见母与儿子被杀等场加以充分描写，这样使剧本比较精练些，使观众的印象也更深刻些。根据他们在排演此剧时屡演屡改的优良作风，在各方面观众的帮助下，此剧将会越改越好，越演越好的。
