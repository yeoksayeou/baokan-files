　　[Our Newspaper] The first Tax Conference of Chahar Province successfully concluded on the 12th of this month. The conference opened on the 8th of this month and lasted for five days. More than 60 people attended, including the directors of the tax bureaus of various special districts, cities, counties, and towns. The conference conveyed the spirit of the National Tax Conference and the tasks of Chahar Province in 1950, and decided on many specific measures to strengthen tax collection and overcome financial difficulties. Jia Lin, Director of the Provincial Tax Bureau, pointed out in his concluding remarks: 1950 will be a year of complete liberation for the whole country, and also a year of extreme financial difficulty. One of the main ways to overcome the difficulties is to strengthen tax collection. Some people believe that taxation will hinder the development of industry and commerce. This understanding is very wrong. Taxation not only increases national revenue, but also reduces currency issuance, which plays a very important role in stabilizing prices and is conducive to the recovery and development of legitimate industry and commerce. Regarding strengthening taxation work, Director Jia proposed: Some cadres have a very strong sense of underestimating taxation, believing that taxation work is "laborious and unrewarding." These erroneous ideas must no longer be allowed to continue. We should realize that taxation work is of great significance to ensuring the final victory of the Liberation War and developing production. Therefore, it not only occupies an important position at present, but taxation work will also be very important for the future national economic construction. Therefore, tax cadres must first attach importance to their work, redouble their efforts to study business and theory, establish correct financial views, and thoroughly eliminate corruption and waste, so as to improve taxation work in the future. Secondly, taxation work must strengthen organization and planning. Leaders should grasp key areas and key industries. Before the first quarter tax collection this year, all levels should systematically conduct industrial and commercial surveys, focusing on typical investigations and combining them with comprehensive surveys. Only by doing a good job in investigation and mastering the real situation can we avoid certain excessively heavy or light phenomena and gradually achieve a fair and reasonable burden. Third, we must strictly establish and improve various systems. Tax cadres should always pay serious attention to tax evasion, and relevant departments should also cooperate closely to plug loopholes in tax collection and increase national income. Cadres at all levels should also further strengthen contact between superiors and subordinates, overcome the bureaucratic work style of leaders not understanding the situation of their subordinates, and certain guerrilla habits and irregular phenomena. Finally, Director Jia proposed strengthening the work of publicizing and explaining tax policies, using newspapers, radio stations, conferences, etc., to repeatedly publicize in order to reduce resistance, exchange experiences, and promote tax collection work.

　　察省税务会议总结
    批评干部轻税思想
    增加税收减少发行有利于工商业
    【本报讯】察哈尔全省首届税务会议已于本月十二日胜利闭幕。会议自本月八日开幕，历时五日；出席者有各专、市、县、镇税务局长等六十余人。会中传达了全国税务会议精神与察省一九五○年任务，并决定加强税收克服财政困难的许多具体办法。省税务局局长贾林在会议总结时指出：一九五○年将是全国彻底解放的一年，也是财政极困难的一年，渡过难关的主要办法之一是加强税收。有人认为征税就要妨碍工商业的发展。这种认识是非常错误的。征税不仅增加了国家财政收入，而且减少货币发行，对平稳物价有极重要的作用，有利于正当工商业的恢复和发展。在加强税务工作上，贾局长提出：有些干部轻税思想很浓厚，认为税务工作是“费力不讨好”。这些错误认识再也不允许继续存在下去。我们应当认识：税务工作对保障解放战争的最后胜利与发展生产均有重要意义。因此它不仅目前占有重要地位，就是将来全国经济建设，税务工作也是很重要的。因此，税务干部首先要重视自己的工作，加倍努力学习业务和理论，建立正确的财政观点，彻底肃清贪污浪费现象，使今后税务工作提高一步。其次，税务工作中要加强组织性、计划性。领导上要掌握重点区和重点行业。在今年第一季税征前，各级要有系统地进行工商业调查，要集中力量进行典型调查，并结合全面调查。只要搞好调查工作，掌握了真实情况，才可避免某些畸重畸轻的现象，逐步做到负担公平合理。第三，要严格建立与健全各种制度。税务干部要经常地严重地注意漏税现象，各有关部门也应密切配合，堵塞税收上的漏洞，增加国家收入。各级干部对上下级的联系也要进一步加强，克服领导上不了解下情的官僚主义作风，与某些游击习气和不正规现象。最后，贾局长提出加强宣传解释税收政策的工作，利用报纸、广播电台、会议等，反复宣传，以便减少阻力，交流经验，推动税收工作。
