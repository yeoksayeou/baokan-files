　　[This report states] wheat seedlings in various parts of Hebei Province have developed jaundice. The North China Agricultural Science Institute has conducted research based on various disease symptoms and has made recommendations to Hebei. The institute believes that the occurrence of jaundice in wheat seedlings in 1949 was due to early sowing and excessive humidity. However, the occurrence of jaundice in winter wheat in 1949 does not determine that wheat will necessarily develop jaundice this year. Therefore, whether wheat will develop jaundice this year mainly depends on the climate after mid-April this year and whether it is suitable for the occurrence of jaundice. If there is more rain after mid-April this year, a serious epidemic of jaundice may occur. To this end, the North China Agricultural Science Institute specifically recommends that in areas where diseased wheat already exists, less watering and less fertilization should be applied if the weather is not dry. At the same time, mobilize the masses to remove diseased wheat seedlings every other row. It is best to stop planting cotton. Because doing so will result in both cotton and wheat not growing well.

### 河北冬麦苗发生黄疸  华北农业科学研究所提出防治法

　　河北冬麦苗发生黄疸
    华北农业科学研究所提出防治法
    【本报讯】河北省各地小麦幼苗已发生黄疸病，华北农业科学研究所特根据各种病状进行研究，并对河北提出建议。该研究所认为：一九四九年小麦幼苗发生黄疸病，是由于播种太早及湿气太大的缘故。但一九四九年冬麦发生黄疸，并不决定今年麦子一定发生黄疸。所以今年小麦是否发生黄疸病，主要的决定于今年四月中旬以后的气候怎样，是否适合黄疸发生。如果今年四月中旬以后多雨，就可能严重流行黄疸病。为此，华北农业科学研究所特建议凡已有病麦地区，如果天气不干可以少浇，少上粪。同时，各地发动群众隔行铲除有病麦苗，种棉花最好停止。因为这样做法，结果会使棉花、小麦都长不好。
