　　Sino-Soviet Treaty Prevents the Resurgence of Japanese Aggression
    World Peace Front Has Been Greatly Strengthened
    Progressive Public Opinion in Various Countries Continues to Cheer the Sino-Soviet Alliance
　　Viet Minh National Salvation Daily
    [Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, February 21st] Vietnam News Agency, North Vietnam, 20th: The news of the signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship arrived on February 18th, precisely when the Vietnamese people were celebrating "Vietnam-Soviet-China Friendship Day," greatly increasing the enthusiasm and joy of the Vietnamese people. Because in this treaty, every Vietnamese person sees not only the bright future of the Soviet Union and China, but also the bright future of Asia and the whole world.
    The Viet Minh's organ, *National Salvation Daily*, said in an editorial: "The Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance, and Mutual Assistance binds the friendly Soviet and Chinese peoples together like iron. This will not only strengthen the friendship between the Soviet Union and China, but will also consolidate world peace. For the imperialists, this is a resounding blow. That is why people all over the world are enthusiastically celebrating the signing of the Sino-Soviet treaty and agreements." The newspaper continued: "As for the Vietnamese people, they warmly welcome this action, because Vietnam is part of the world's peace-loving and progressive forces, and its destiny is closely linked with the destiny of the democratic people."
    French Communist Party's *l'Humanité*
    [Xinhua News Agency, Prague, February 21st] The French Communist Party's organ *l'Humanité* published a commentary on the 16th by Pierre Goutard entitled "A Historic Act," arguing that the signing of the Sino-Soviet treaty was a heavy blow to anti-Soviet propagandists. The author wrote: For weeks, anti-Soviet propagandists have repeatedly claimed that negotiations had reached a deadlock, and that the Soviet Union wanted to "split China," etc. Now, they have to admit that they were deceiving themselves. This treaty, fully in accordance with the principles of the United Nations Charter, because the security measures it planned are aimed at Japan, one of the aggressor countries in the Second World War, and "any other state that may collaborate with Japan directly or indirectly in acts of aggression." The author pointed out that, under the present circumstances, the strengthening of Sino-Soviet friendship is the establishment of an incomparably effective tool for peace. This will have a great impact on the entire Far East and the people of the world who are struggling for liberation from imperialist shackles. Especially in Vietnam, after the Soviet Union recognized the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam headed by President Ho Chi Minh, people will compare the difference between the Soviet Union's attitude and the United States' support for the puppet Bao Dai. The author concluded that all those who uphold peace are cheering this great political action, and they will redouble their efforts to build lasting peace, which is one of the fundamental goals set by the two major countries of China and the Soviet Union in their joint actions.
    Australian Communist Party's *Tribune*
    [Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, February 21st] TASS, Sydney, 20th: The *Tribune* commented on the Sino-Soviet Thirty-Year Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance, saying: This treaty further consolidates the world peace front, gives the American imperialists' military plans in the Pacific a devastating blow, and strengthens the security of the people of Asia and Australasia. The newspaper pointed out: The purpose of the US Pacific policy is mainly to restore the military power of Japanese fascism, which greatly worries the people in those countries that have suffered from Japanese aggression, "The people of these countries will welcome the Sino-Soviet treaty and see it as a bulwark against the resurgence of Japanese aggression."
    The newspaper mentioned that US Secretary of State Acheson said last month that the Soviet Union had "carved out" certain places from China, saying: "The Sino-Soviet treaty exposes Acheson as a blatant liar." *Tribune* concluded: "The Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China also declared in their treaty their willingness to participate in all international activities aimed at ensuring world peace and security, and to contribute fully to the realization of this goal." *Tribune* pointed out: This statement greatly strengthens the world peace front, which is already stronger than the forces of war.

　　中苏缔约防止日本侵略再起
    世界和平阵线已大大加强         
    各国进步舆论继续为中苏同盟欢呼
　　越盟救国报
    【新华社北京二十一日电】越南通讯社北越二十日讯：中苏友好条约签订的消息，在二月十八日正当越南人民庆祝“越苏中友好日”的时候传来，这使越南人民的热情和欢乐大为增加。因为在这个条约里，每一个越南人不仅看到苏联和中国的光明前途，而且还看到亚洲和全世界的光明前途。
    越盟机关报《救国报》社论说：“中苏友好同盟互助条约像铁一样地把友好的苏联和中国人民联结起来了。这不仅将加强苏中两国友谊，而且将巩固世界的和平。对于帝国主义者，这是一记清脆的打击。这就是为什么全世界人民都在狂热地庆祝中苏条约和协定的签订。该报继称：“至于越南人民，他们热烈欢迎这个行动，因为越南是世界爱好和平的与进步力量的一部分，它的命运与民主人民的命运是紧密地连在一起的。”
    法共人道报
    【新华社布拉格二十一日电】法共机关报人道报于十六日登载皮爱·古达德所作题为“一个历史性的行动”的评论，认为中苏条约的签订是对反苏宣传家的一个沉重打击。作者写道：数星期来，反苏宣传家们一再宣传，说什么商谈已进入僵局，说苏联要“分裂中国”等等。现在，他们不得不承认他们是在自骗骗人了。这个条约，完全符合于联合国宪章的原则，因为它所策划的安全措施，是针对着第二次大战中侵略国之一的日本以及“其他直接或间接在侵略行为上与日本相勾结的任何国家”。作者指出，在目前情况下，中苏友好的加强，就是建立起一个无可比拟的有效的和平工具。这对于全远东，全世界为从帝国主义桎梏下解放而斗争的人民，将发生伟大的影响。尤其是在越南，在苏联承认以胡志明主席为首的越南民主共和国政府之后，人们会比较出苏联这种态度，和美国支持傀儡保大的态度，究竟有何等的区别。作者最后称，所有拥护和平的人们，都欢呼这一伟大的政治行动，他们将加倍地努力，以建立持久和平，而这正是中苏两大国在他们共同行动上所订定的基本目标之一。
    澳共论坛报
    【新华社北京二十一日电】塔斯社悉尼二十日讯：论坛报评论中苏三十年友好同盟互助条约说：这个条约进一步巩固了世界和平阵线，给了美帝国主义者在太平洋的军事计划以一个摧毁的打击，并加强了亚洲和大洋洲人民的安全。该报指出：美国的太平洋政策的目的，主要是恢复日本法西斯主义的军事力量，这种情形使那些曾受日本侵略之害的国家里的人民大为焦虑，“这些国家的人民将欢迎中苏条约，把它看作是防止日本侵略再起的堡垒”。
    该报提起美国国务卿艾奇逊上月曾硬说苏联从中国“割去”某些地方时说：“中苏条约揭穿了艾奇逊是一个明目张胆的说谎家”。论坛报结语说：“苏联和中华人民共和国在它们的条约中还宣布愿意参加所有以确保世界和平与安全为目的之国际活动，并为此目的之实现，充分贡献其力量。”论坛报指出：这个声明大大加强了已经比战争力量强大的世界和平阵线。
