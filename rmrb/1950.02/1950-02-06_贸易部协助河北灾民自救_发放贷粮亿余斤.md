　　Ministry of Trade Assists Hebei Disaster Victims in Self-Relief
    Distributing Over 100 Million Jin of Grain Loans
    [Reported by this newspaper] To restore productivity in disaster areas and assist disaster victims in production for self-relief, the Ministry of Trade of the Central People's Government decided on the 3rd of this month to loan 120 million jin of coarse grains to disaster areas in Hebei Province, stipulating that it be repaid after the wheat harvest this year. The exchange ratio for repayment, wheat to coarse grains, is set at: one jin of wheat equals one jin and seven liang of sorghum or one jin and six liang of corn. The grain will be rationally distributed through cooperative societies at all levels in the province's disaster areas. The grain loans have already begun to be transported to the severely affected areas of Tianjin, Cangxian, Tangshan, Baoding, Tongxian, and other five special districts, as well as parts of Hengshui, Shimen, Dingxian, and other special districts. To save on transportation costs, local cooperatives are widely mobilizing the masses in disaster areas to organize transportation.

    发放贷粮亿余斤
    【本报讯】中央人民政府贸易部为恢复灾区生产力，协助灾民生产自救，本月三日决定贷给河北省灾区粗粮一亿两千万斤，规定今年麦收后归还。归还时麦与粗粮的交换比率为：一斤小麦合高粱一斤七两或玉米一斤六两。粮食系通过该省灾区各级合作社进行合理分配。此项贷粮现已开始起运至重灾区天津、沧县、唐山、保定、通县等五个专区和衡水、石门、定县等专区部分地区。为节省运费，各地合作社正广泛发动灾区群众组织运输。
