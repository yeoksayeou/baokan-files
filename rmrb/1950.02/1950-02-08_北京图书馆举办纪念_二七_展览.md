    Holds Exhibition Commemorating the "February 7th" Incident

    [This Dispatch] The National Beijing Library began holding a "Commemorating the 'February 7th' Exhibition" at the library on the 7th to commemorate the "February 7th" Workers' Movement. The content includes newspapers from the time of the "February 7th" incident, photos of martyr Shi Yang, who died in Wuchang, photos of his tomb, and portraits of veteran workers who participated in the "February 7th" Movement. In addition, there are many photos and books of the workers' movement from other eras. The most valuable item is the "Jiang'an Trade Union Membership Certificate" from the "February 7th" era.

    Most of these valuable materials (mostly photos and the "Jiang'an Trade Union Membership Certificate," etc.) were borrowed from the National Railway General Trade Union. They were only transported from Zhengzhou to Beijing in the last two days. The exhibition will last for about a week. (Wang Yi)

    【本报讯】国立北京图书馆为纪念“二七”工人运动，已于七日开始在该馆举行“纪念‘二七’展览会”。内容包括“二七”当时的报纸，在武昌遇难的施洋烈士的照片及其坟墓的照片与参加“二七”运动的老工人像等；此外还有许多其他时代工人运动的照片及书籍等。其中最珍贵的有“二七”时代的‘江岸工会会员证’。
    这批宝贵的材料（大部照片及“江岸工会会员证”等）多是全国铁路总工会借给的。在最近两天内才从郑州运到北京。展览时间约为一星期。（王毅）
