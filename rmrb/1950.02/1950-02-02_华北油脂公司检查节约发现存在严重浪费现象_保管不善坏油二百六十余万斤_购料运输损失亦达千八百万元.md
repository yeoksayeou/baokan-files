　　North China Grease Company Inspection Reveals Serious Waste
    Over Two Million Six Hundred Thousand Jin of Oil Spoiled Due to Poor Storage; Purchase and Transportation Losses Also Reach Eighteen Million Yuan

    [Reported by this Newspaper] Tianjin Daily News: The North China Grease Company has been conducting a savings inspection since the beginning of this month. The results have revealed that the company has severe waste in all aspects of oil storage, procurement, processing, storage, transportation, capital utilization, expense spending, and working hours, causing great losses to national property. The inspection found that 2,676,000 jin of stored vegetable oil was spoiled. The reasons for the spoilage were: first, irresponsibility in the purchase of oil products; second, prolonged storage and poor storage practices, such as placing oil barrels horizontally in summer, allowing rainwater to leak into the barrels and spoil the oil. Mineral oil also suffered significant losses due to poor packaging and careless filling. In terms of material procurement, the company suffered significant losses in purchase prices due to a lack of understanding of market conditions and blind transactions with speculative merchants, compounded by a lack of thorough inspection by leaders. For example, the company bought 600 pieces of timber from Lin Jihao, paying 3,000 yuan more per piece than the market price; it bought 3,300 jin of iron wire, paying 350 yuan more per jin; and it bought 10,000 jin of lead wire, paying about 700 yuan more per jin. These three items alone resulted in a loss of over 9.9 million yuan. In storage and transportation, a shipment of 3,300 barrels of diesel from the import company was delayed due to a lack of internal coordination, resulting in over 3 million yuan in additional storage fees. Because the company was routinely closed on Sundays, 31 freight cars of oil materials arriving by rail in December were fined for delayed unloading, totaling over 5.3 million yuan. In terms of capital utilization, the accumulation of thousands of tons of oil products and slow exports resulted in the stagnation of large amounts of capital. In addition, there was a significant waste of time, such as excessive meetings with insufficient preparation, leading to slow problem-solving. There was also a lot of waste in office expenses, especially in telephone usage, with excessive unnecessary long-distance calls. Telephone expenses alone amounted to over 5 million yuan between October of last year and January 15th of this year. Furthermore, the inspection revealed that some cadres had improper work styles, accepting dinners, theater tickets, and baths from merchants. Li Guangjun, the manager of the company, pointed out at a meeting of all cadres that the main reason for the waste was the cadres' lack of a correct understanding of "saving," their political numbness and carelessness, and consequently their insufficient care for national property. In addition, there was serious bureaucracy in leadership, a failure to inspect and improve work in a timely manner, and a lack of strict organizational systems and communication between departments. Some cadres also had a strong tendency towards hedonism, content with enjoying life and lacking the drive for progress. Manager Li believed that, in addition to correcting bureaucracy at the leadership level, everyone should carefully study the New Year's Day editorial published by Xinhua News Agency in 1950, "Complete Victory, Consolidate Victory," to establish a correct understanding of saving from an ideological standpoint. Through inspection work, a mass savings campaign should be implemented. He called on the company's Party members and Youth League members to actively respond to the higher authorities' call for saving and to play an exemplary role in saving work, ensuring the completion of tasks.

　　华北油脂公司检查节约发现存在严重浪费现象
    保管不善坏油二百六十余万斤  购料运输损失亦达千八百万元
    【本报讯】天津日报消息：华北油脂公司从本月初到现在开展节约检查的结果，已发现该公司在油料保管、收购、加工、储运、运用资金、经费开支、及工作时间等各方面，均存在有极严重的浪费现象，使国家资财蒙受很大损失。检查出现存植物油中，坏油达二百六十七万六千斤。产生坏油的原因，一是由于收购油品时不负责任；一是由于储存过久，不善于保管，夏季油桶平放，雨水漏进桶中，致使油质变坏。矿物油因装具不良，且因灌装油品时不谨慎，损耗也很大。在购料方面，由于事前没很好了解市场情况，盲目向投机商人进行交易，事后领导上又没有很好检查，购价上受到很大损失。如该公司曾向林记号标买木材六百根，每根比市价即多花三千元；买铁丝三千三百斤，每斤多花三百五十元；买铅丝一万斤，每斤约多花七百元。以上三项即损失人民币达九百九十余万元。在储藏和运输工作中，有一次进口公司拨来柴油三千三百桶，因内部业务联系不够，搬运耽搁时间，致多花栈租三百余万元。由于该公司星期日照例不办公，致使十二月间由铁路运来的油料中，有三十一个车皮因延期卸货而被罚，共缴罚款达五百三十余万元。在使用资金方面，因油品积存数千吨，出口迟缓，积压了大量资金。此外在时间使用上浪费也很大，例如开会过多，会前准备不够，以致会议解决问题很迟缓等等。办公费中，电话浪费也很多，不必要的长途电话打得过多，仅去年十月到今年一月十五日之间，电话费一项就达五百多万元。更从检查节约中，发现有的干部作风不正派，接受商人的请客、看戏、洗澡等。该公司李光军经理在全体干部会上检讨此次浪费产生的主要原因中指出，这是由于干部本身缺乏对“节约”的正确认识，政治上麻痹大意，因而对国家资财的爱护就很不够。加以领导上存在着严重的官僚主义，不能及时检查和改进工作，缺乏严密的组织制度，各部门之间也缺乏联系。个别干部更存在着较为浓厚的享乐思想，满足于生活上的享受，不求进步。李经理认为除从领导上要纠正官僚主义以外，要求大家很好的学习一九五零年元旦新华社发表的《完成胜利，巩固胜利》的社论，从思想上对节约建立正确的认识。通过检查工作，贯彻群众性的节约运动。他号召该公司的党团员，应积极响应上级的节约号召，在节约工作中起模范作用，保证完成任务。
