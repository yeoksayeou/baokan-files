[Beijing News] Primary and secondary school teachers and university students in the capital are currently engaged in learning during the winter vacation through various means such as professional study meetings, youth lectures, political training classes, and cadre study meetings.

Nearly six thousand primary and secondary school teachers in the city concentrated on political study during last year's summer vacation. Now, the Winter Vacation Study Committee organized by the Beijing Municipal People's Government Bureau of Culture and Education, the Preparatory Committee of the Municipal Education Workers' Union, and the Municipal Committee of the Communist Youth League plans to hold lectures during the winter vacation on subjects such as Chinese language, history, geography, natural science, music, fine arts, manual labor, physical education, and primary school teaching issues. These lectures will focus on enabling primary and secondary school teachers to study teaching methods that emphasize the unity of theory and practice and the integration of political education, summarize the professional learning and teaching experiences of the past six months, and invite Qian Junrui, Deputy Minister of Education, to speak on "Cultural and Educational Policies," and Liu Shi to speak on "Teacher's Self-Cultivation," etc.

In order to educate Communist Party members, Communist Youth League members, and activists in primary and secondary schools, the Organization Department of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China sponsored a political training class for primary and secondary school teachers and students in September last year. More than 1,600 Party members, League members, and activists from primary and secondary schools participated in the study, which focused on the education of the Party program and Party constitution. During the current winter vacation, they will further study the Party program and Party constitution, and study branch work methods and leadership methods in connection with actual work.

The Communist Youth League's study meeting for university and secondary school cadres mainly focuses on the situation in 1950 and arranges the work of the school's Communist Youth League for the first half of this year during the winter vacation. More than 1,300 Youth League cadres from universities and secondary schools are participating in the study. Feng Wenbin, Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League, has already spoken to them about "The Tasks of the School Communist Youth League," etc. The Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Youth League also organizes Youth League members who are primary school teachers to study the organizational principles of the Communist Youth League, the work of the Communist Youth League among primary school teachers, and the work of Young Pioneers among primary and secondary school students.

The youth lectures sponsored by the Communist Youth League Committee and the Student Union of Peking University and Tsinghua University have already begun. At Peking University, Hu Hua, He Sijing, Li Lisan, and Tao Dayong have given lectures on "The History of the Chinese Revolution," "International Issues from the Perspective of the Proletariat's History," "Internationalism," and "Financial and Economic Policies in 1950," etc. In addition to Peking University students, students from Sino-French, Fu Jen, and Union Medical College also attended the lectures. At Tsinghua University, Qiao Guanghua, Yang Shu, and Han Tianshi have spoken on "The International Situation," "The Domestic Situation," and "Youth Activities Abroad," respectively. Each lecture was attended by more than 1,000 students from Tsinghua and Yenching Universities.

The winter vacation youth lectures held by the Winter Vacation Youth Work Committee were given by Yang Shu, Chen Jiakang, Yang Bozhen, Zhang Dazhong, and others during the first week on "Our Friend - the Soviet Union". 15,000 middle school students and youths from all walks of life attended the lectures in three days. Starting today (10th), the lecture content will include "Talking about Atomic Energy" and other lectures related to natural science and Marxism-Leninism.

In addition, there are also literary and artistic lectures and professional study classes, attracting about 800 music, art, and physical education teachers from primary and secondary schools, as well as Communist Youth League members and students from universities and secondary schools who love literary and artistic activities.
