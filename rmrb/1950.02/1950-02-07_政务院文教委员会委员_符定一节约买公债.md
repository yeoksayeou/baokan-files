    Fu Dingyi saves money to buy public bonds
    [Our Newspaper] Since the issuance of the Victory Discount Public Bonds, people from all walks of life across the country have been actively subscribing. Recently, people in Beijing have been rushing to banks to subscribe to public bonds. It is reported that Fu Dingyi, a member of the Government Administration Council's Culture and Education Committee, entrusted Jin Cheng Bank yesterday to purchase 30 public bonds with more than half of his living allowance, saying, "Purchasing Victory Public Bonds is the duty of the people. If you have a bit of strength, you should buy a bit. If you have ten, a hundred, or a thousand shares of strength, you should buy ten, a hundred, or a thousand shares. The enthusiasm with which the people are subscribing to public bonds is a concrete manifestation of their love for the country and the government, and it is sufficient to prove that the government's actions have won the faith and support of the people, and that a victorious completion is undoubtedly certain."
