Tangshan Qixin Cement Factory East Repair Shop
Successfully Uses Carbon Blocks for Furnace Roof Steelmaking
Average Cost Reduced by 5.5 Million Yuan Per Ton

[Reported by this newspaper] The Tangshan Qixin Cement Factory East Repair Shop's success in using carbon blocks instead of silica bricks and firebricks for furnace roofs in steelmaking has increased production efficiency, representing a significant contribution to the steelmaking industry. In the second half of last year, the repair shop had to halt production due to a shortage of furnace cover bricks. By July and August, over 160 tons of steel castings were backlogged throughout the factory. To solve this problem, the factory technician Zang Yiqing, after repeated research, believed that besides silica bricks and firebricks, carbon blocks were the most heat-resistant refractory material. With his design research and the assistance of steelmaking department workers such as Ma Zhenshan, they overcame the difficulties of lacking excellent tools, collected a large number of carbon blocks, and made 295 carbon bricks to build the furnace roof. Since the trial began on October 9 last year, until January 16 this year, a total of 38 furnaces of steel have been smelted, proceeding very smoothly. This innovation has greatly reduced the cost of steelmaking. According to test results, one set of carbon block furnace roof can smelt 18.18 tons of steel; if silica brick covers are used, 13.3 sets are needed to smelt the same amount of steel, reducing costs by 7,194,000 yuan. The average cost reduction per ton of steel is 395,000 yuan. If the saved iron material, electricity, and electrodes are included, the cost reduction per ton of steel is 557,500 yuan. There have also been great achievements in improving production efficiency. According to the factory's statistics, it takes only 2.46 minutes to produce a furnace of steel with a carbon block furnace roof, while it takes 4.13 minutes with a silica brick furnace roof. At the same time, because the silica brick furnace roof melts under high heat and mostly falls into the furnace, the alkalinity of the slag gradually weakens, resulting in phosphorus reversion. When the steel parts solidify, the segregation of phosphorus increases the cold brittleness of the steel parts, thereby reducing the seismic resistance of the steel parts and making the cast steel parts prone to fracture. If a carbon block furnace roof is used, the steel liquid can be kept clean, and the quality of the cast products will be improved.

　　唐山启新洋灰厂修机厂
    用炭精作炉顶炼钢成功     
    每吨钢平均减低成本五十五万元
    【本报讯】唐山启新洋灰厂东修机厂，以炭精砖代矽砖、耐火砖做炉顶炼钢成功，生产效率因之提高，在炼钢事业上实一大贡献。该修机厂在去年下半年，曾因缺乏炉盖砖而使生产停顿。到七八月间，全厂待铸钢件积压一百六十余吨。为解决这一问题，该厂技师臧毅卿经多次研究，认为耐火器材除矽砖与耐火砖外，炭精是最能抵抗高热的耐火材料。在他的设计研究与炼钢部工人马振山等的协助下，克服了缺乏优良工具的困难，搜集了大批炭精，制成二百九十五块炭精砖，砌成炉顶。自去年十月九日开始试炼，到今年一月十六日，共炼钢三十八炉，进行十分顺利。这一创造大大降低了炼钢成本。根据试验结果，一套炭精砖炉顶，可炼钢一八·一八吨；若用矽砖炉盖，炼同样数量的钢要用十三·三套。可减少成本七百十九万四千元。每吨钢平均减少成本三十九万五千元。若连同节省的铁料、电能、电极等计算在内，则每吨钢可减低成本五十五万七千五百元。在生产效率的提高上也有很大成绩。据该厂统计，用炭精炉顶出一炉钢，仅需时间二点四十六分钟，而用矽砖炉顶则需四点十三分。同时，因矽砖炉顶受高热熔化，大部坠入炉中，使炉碴的碱性逐渐薄弱，因而发生复磷作用。到了钢件凝固时，由于磷的分凝作用，就增加了钢件的冷脆性，因而减低了钢件的抗震力，使铸出的钢件易于折裂。若使用炭精炉顶，钢液可保持清洁，铸出的产品质量也就增高。
