　　"False Witnesses" - A Unique American Product

    The Berlin newspaper *New Times* published a New York dispatch:

    "A wealthy American was traveling through various states during his vacation. In Chicago, he got into an argument and killed his opponent. This very ambitious American immediately sent a telegram to his legal counsel in New York: 'Accused of murder. Prepare defense, paying five thousand dollars, come quickly.'"

    A reply telegram arrived from New York a few hours later:

    "Flying immediately. Guarantee acquittal. Bringing two witnesses."

    Indeed, the American millionaire who committed manslaughter can rest assured.

    Whether according to American justice or past practices, all this is very clear. It is just necessary to say a few more words about this kind of American false witness.

    The more cunning the two fellows the New York lawyer brings, the more they are "seasoned" American false witnesses. Aren't these the types who lobby in the lounges of United Nations conferences, "testifying" on any issue on the agenda according to the orders of Wall Street? Today there are representatives of the Kuomintang, tomorrow there are Tito's executioners, and the day after tomorrow come the Greek fascist royalists...

    The only difference is the amount of money received for perjury.

    The prices are different, but the goods are the same. (Reprinted from Shanghai *Era* Magazine)

　　“假证人”——美国的特产
    柏林《新时代报》刊载了一则纽约专电：
    “某一个富有的美国人在假期中去各州游历。他在芝加哥跟人发生争执，把对手打死了。这个事业心非常浓厚的美国人立刻打了一封电报给纽约的法律顾问道：‘被控杀人。请准备辩护，付五千元，速来。’”
    几小时后纽约来了回电：
    “即飞。保证开释。随带证人两名。”
    真的，这个打死了人的美国富翁可以安心了。
    不论按照美国司法或以往的惯例，这一切都使人很清楚的，只是对这种美国假证人，还须说几句话。
    纽约律师带着飞的这两个家伙越狡滑，他们就越是“老练的”美国假证人；在联合国会议的休息室中游说，按照华尔街的命令为议程上任何一个问题“作证”的，不是这批东西吗？今天有国民党的代表，明天有铁托的刽子手，后天又来了希腊的法西斯保皇党……。
    不同的只是做伪证得到的钱有多有少而已。
    价目不同，货色则一。（转载自上海《时代》杂志）
