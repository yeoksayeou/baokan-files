The People's Insurance Company of China, in order to ensure the safety of parcels mailed by the public through post offices, has listed parcel insurance as one of its key business areas to promote this year. It plans to entrust postal administrations across the country to act as agents for this business, so as to reach into the countryside and serve the broad masses of the people universally. The Shanghai Postal Administration Bureau of the East China Region signed an agency contract with the East China Region branch of the company in October of last year and began implementing it. Whenever the loss exceeds the limit of the insured value of the package stipulated by the post office, the People's Insurance Company of China will be responsible for compensation. Due to the simple insurance procedures (the sender can fill out an insurance application form at the post office and obtain an insurance policy countersigned by the post office) and the wide range of protection, the number of people taking out insurance is very large. By the end of last year, 465 insurance policies had been issued, with a total insured amount of 485,352,100 yuan. Recently, post offices in Fuzhou and other places, seeing the significant results of the Shanghai post office's handling of this business, are also planning to sign agency contracts with the People's Insurance Company of China.

　　保险公司推广邮包保险业务
    华东区上海邮管局开始代理
    【本报讯】中国人民保险公司为保障人民大众由邮政局邮寄包裹安全起见，已将邮包险列为本年度推展业务之一。并计划委托全国各地邮政管理局代理该项业务，以便深入乡村，普遍地为广大人民服务。华东区上海邮政管理局，已于去年十月间与该公司华东区公司签订代理合同，开始实行。凡损失超过邮局规定保价包件限额时，均由中国人民保险公司负责赔偿。由于投保手续的简便（寄件人在邮局内填写投保单，即可取得邮局代签的保险单）与保障范围的广泛，投保的人数很多。截止去年底止，已签发保险单四六五张，承保总保险金额计四亿八千五百三十五万二千一百元。最近福州等地邮局，因鉴于上海邮局办理已有显著成效，亦拟与中国人民保险公司订立代理合同。
