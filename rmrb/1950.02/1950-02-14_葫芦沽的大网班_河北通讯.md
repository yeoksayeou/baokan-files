　　The Big Net Team of Hulu Gu
　　——Hebei Correspondence

　　Hulu Gu is a small village in the Ninth District of Baodi County, Hebei Province. The whole village has sixty-four households. Last July, there was a major flood, and all the land was submerged, so no one harvested any grain. At that time, the masses' thinking was very chaotic, and seven households fled due to the famine. When the district and village cadres saw this situation, they called on and led the masses to engage in production for self-salvation. The masses began running transportation and doing short-term work in other villages. While the people were engaged in production, they wondered what to do in the winter. Liu Lisan, the secretary of the district committee, told the masses: "Based on the conditions in the village, do whatever you can. As long as you don't violate policies, it's fine." The masses remembered that during the major flood ten years ago, they had organized a big net team and survived the disaster. Now, those tools can be salvaged. Everyone knew that this kind of production generated a lot of income, and if done well, it could solve the livelihood problems of the entire village. However, weaving nets cost too much money, and it couldn't be done with just a few people. For example, to weave sixty three-section big nets, just buying thread, hemp, and other materials would cost more than seven thousand catties of millet. The masses all said: If we want to do it, we need a government loan.

　　Yu Chengshan, the peasant representative from Hulu Gu attending the Baodi County People's Representative Conference, returned to the village, and he thought: No matter how difficult it is, we must organize the big net team. He first discussed it with village chief Wang Qingzhu and a few other cadres, and the cadres all agreed. So everyone widely publicized the policy of production for self-salvation to the masses, calling on them to sell things and rely on relatives and friends, no matter what, to organize the big net team. Then they held a mass meeting. Yu Chengshan said at the meeting: "As long as everyone works together, and puts in as much effort as possible, there is no difficulty that cannot be overcome. We can't just rely on government relief!" Everyone said: "A man without a head cannot walk, and a bird without a head cannot fly." So they elected him as the net leader to lead everyone in fishing. On the spot, forty households signed up to find ways to buy thread and weave nets. After the meeting, six families, including Zuo Hongbei, sold the wheat they had stored, four families, including Wang Yutian, sold the firewood they had stored, and fifteen households, including Wang Huanqi, also saved money to buy thread to weave nets. Mo Fusheng borrowed money from relatives to buy seven and a half catties of cotton. His mother spun the thread, and his daughter-in-law wove the net... The net was woven, but there were no net ropes and net strings. The Baodi branch of the People's Bank lent them one thousand and fifty catties of wheat to support them. Yu Chengshan sold the wheat and bought back more than five hundred catties of good hemp from Tianjin, collectively made it into net ropes and net strings, and tied up the net. The shareholding method of the big net team was: one labor force plus one net counted as one share. Two households did not have nets, only contributed labor, and counted as half a share. Everyone pooled together sixty shares, and sixty people participated in fishing.

　　After more than three months of preparation, the big net team was officially organized! They started fishing on December 15th of last year. Every day when the rooster crowed twice, net leader Yu Chengshan beat the first gong to let everyone get up to cook. He beat the second gong to gather and depart. When the net was pulled out, everyone worked together to process the fish. The trader sold the fish to the vendors, exchanged it for grain, and immediately sent it to each family's home. They came out under the stars every day, and went back under the stars, catching fish non-stop, one net after another... In forty days, they caught 20,600 catties of fish. Each share received an average of seven or eight catties of sorghum every day, which was enough to eat with a little bran mixed in, and there was even a surplus for families with fewer people.

　　Now there are still three or four feet of standing water around Hulu Gu, and it is estimated that autumn crops cannot be planted this year. Long-term planning is necessary. At present, the village has organized another thirty-seven households to weave water nets, preparing to fish in the spring.

　　葫芦沽的大网班
    ——河北通讯
    葫芦沽是河北省宝坻县九区的一个小村。全村六十四户。去年七月里发大水，地都淹了，各家都没有收下粮食。当时群众思想很混乱，有七户逃荒走了。区村干部看到这种情况，便号召和领导群众生产自救。群众开始跑运输，到外村打短工。大伙一面生产着，一面考虑冬天怎么办？区委书记刘立三告诉群众说：“根据村中的条件，能搞什么就搞什么。只要不违犯政策就行。”群众想起了十年前闹大水时，曾组织过大网班，渡过了灾荒。现在，那些家具还可以收拾起来。大家知道这种生产收入大，弄好了能解决全村群众的生活问题。就是织网花钱太大，人少了搞不起来。例如：织六十扇的三节大网，只买线、买麻和其他材料，就得七千多斤小米。群众都说：要想搞起来，非得政府贷款才行。
    葫芦沽出席全县各界代表会议的农民代表喻成山，回到村里，他想：不管多么困难，也要把大网班组织起来。他先和村长王庆珠等几个干部商量，干部们都同意。于是大家就普遍向群众宣传生产自救方针，号召群众变卖东西，托亲靠友，无论如何也要组织大网班。接着又开了群众大会。喻成山在会上说：“只要大伙齐心干，有多大力量使多大力量，没有克服不了的困难。咱不能光依靠政府救济呀！”大伙说：“人无头不走，鸟无头不飞”。就选他当网头，领导大家治鱼。当场就有四十户报名想法买线织网。会后，左洪贝等六家把存的麦子卖了，王玉田等四家存的木柴卖了，王焕祺等十五户也省出钱来买线织网。么福生从亲戚家借钱买了七斤半棉花，他母亲纺线，媳妇织网。……网织好了，但是没有网绠和网弦。人民银行宝坻支行贷给一千零五十斤麦子，扶持他们。喻成山把麦子卖了，从天津买回五百多斤好麻，集体打成网绠和网弦，拴好了网。大网班的集股办法是：一个人力加一扇网算一股，有两户没有网，光出人，算半股。大家一共集了六十个股，六十个人参加治鱼。
    经过三个多月的准备，大网班正式组织起来了！从去年十二月十五日开始捕鱼。每天鸡叫两遍，网头喻成山打头遍锣，让各家起来做饭。打第二遍锣就集合出发。等出网大家一起治鱼。交易员把鱼售给小贩，换到粮食，立时送到每人家里。他们每天顶着星星出来，顶着星星回去，一网接着一网不停地捕着……。四十天捕得二万零六百斤鱼。每股每天平均分到七、八斤红粮，搀上点糠就够吃了，人口少的还有剩余。
    现在葫芦沽周围还有三、四尺深的积水，估计今年秋庄稼也种不上。非做长期打算不行。眼下该村又组织了三十七家织水网，准备春季治鱼。
