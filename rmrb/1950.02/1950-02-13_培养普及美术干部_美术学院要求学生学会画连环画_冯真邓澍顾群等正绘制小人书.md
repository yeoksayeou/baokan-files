　　Training Popular Art Cadres
    Art Academy Requires Students to Learn to Draw Comic Strips
    Feng Zhen, Deng Shu, Gu Qun, and Others are Drawing Picture Books
    [Report from this newspaper] The Central Academy of Fine Arts in Beijing held a meeting of department heads, professors, and other staff above that level at the end of the winter vacation. The meeting summarized the teaching experience of the last semester and formulated a plan for the next semester. At the meeting, there was a heated discussion on the specific requirements for teaching. President Xu Beihong said in his concluding remarks: We must train art cadres who can do popular work. In the next semester, we should strengthen students' political study and improve their awareness of serving the people. Second and third-year students must learn to draw comic strips and New Year pictures; fourth-year students' painting creations must reach a level that can be printed, otherwise, they will not be promoted. He hoped that professors would strengthen research work and guide students' creation.
    Another report: Feng Zhen, Deng Shu, Gu Qun and others from the school's Research Department creation group have completed a picture book, "Liu Hulan," and plan to continue creating two more picture books during the winter vacation.

    【本报讯】北京中央美术学院于寒假结束时召开了本科主任教授以上的工作人员会议。总结上学期教学经验，拟定下学期计划。会上热烈讨论了对教学的具体要求。徐悲鸿院长在结语中说：我们要培养能作普及工作的美术干部。在下学期应加强学生政治学习，提高学生为人民服务思想。二三年级学生必须学会画连环画和年画；四年级学生绘画创作要达到能印刷出来的水平，否则不能升级。希望教授们加强研究工作，指导学生创作。
    又讯：该校研究部创作组冯真、邓澍、顾群等已绘完小人书刘胡兰一种，并拟在寒假内继续创作两部小人书。
