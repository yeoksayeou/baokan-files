Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, February 4th: The Central Committee of the China New Democratic Youth League, the All-China Youth Federation, and the All-China Students' Federation jointly issued a "Notice Regarding the Commemoration of the 'Day of Struggle Against Colonialism'" on February 1st. The full text of the notice is as follows:

(1) February 21st is the World Democratic Youth's Day of Struggle Against Colonialism, marking the upsurge of the anti-imperialist struggle of peace-loving and democratic people around the world and the will of enslaved youth in colonial and semi-colonial countries to strive for freedom and liberation. Following the development of the national liberation movement after the end of the anti-fascist war, the Indian Navy revolted against British imperialism on February 21, 1946. On the same day the following year, Egyptian students were massacred for demanding the withdrawal of British troops from Egypt. In 1948, the Southeast Asia Youth Conference was held during the same period, putting forward the slogan "Imperialism Get Out of Asia." Because February 21st is closely related to the anti-imperialist struggle of colonial youth, the Council of the Youth League, held in Poland in the autumn of the same year, officially designated February 21st as the "Day of Support for Colonial Youth Struggle." The International Student Union also calls on students from all countries to actively participate in this movement every year. Since the Second Congress of the World Federation of Democratic Youth, February 21st has been called the "Day of Struggle Against Colonialism."

(2) This year's commemoration of February 21st takes place at a time when the Chinese people have defeated imperialism and domestic reactionary forces, and have achieved a victory of historical significance; the liberation wars of the Vietnamese and Burmese people have achieved significant results, liberating most of their territories; the people of Malaya, the Philippines, and Indonesia are persisting in arduous guerrilla warfare against imperialism and the rule of domestic reactionaries; the people of countries such as India and Iran are striving for genuine national independence and the most basic rights of the people under extremely cruel terror and persecution; and the people of colonial and semi-colonial countries around the world are becoming increasingly aware and organized under the frantic exploitation of imperialism led by the United States, opposing imperialism's imposition of the burden of economic crisis on them, and opposing imperialism's use of colonial human resources to prepare for wars of aggression. This shows that the people of colonial and semi-colonial countries, encouraged by the powerful world peace and democracy forces led by the Soviet Union and the victory of the Chinese revolution, realize that they can only achieve freedom and independence under the leadership of the working class, relying on armed struggle, and combining the national liberation struggle with the world peace movement. When Chinese youth commemorate the "Day of Struggle Against Colonialism," they should universally publicize the significance of the anti-imperialist struggle of the people and youth in colonial and semi-colonial countries, explaining that this struggle is an important part of the entire world's struggle for peace and democracy, and its progress and victory will undoubtedly strengthen the power of the world's democratic camp against imperialism, and help the Chinese people consolidate their already achieved victories, and thwart the imperialist conspiracy to use Southeast Asian colonial countries as bases for attacking New China. There are nearly ten million overseas Chinese in Malaya, the Philippines, Siam, Australia, and the French-occupied areas of Vietnam, who are subjected to the exclusion, abuse, and massacre by imperialism and its running dogs in various places. Chinese youth must support and comfort the young overseas Chinese in these countries, and call on them to unite and form a united front against imperialism with the local people.

(3) In order to publicize and encourage the struggle of colonial youth against imperialism through the "Day of Struggle Against Colonialism," all localities should immediately begin to carry out planned propaganda activities among the broad masses of youth, and adopt the following measures according to the specific circumstances:

    1. Carry out propaganda through youth magazines, newspapers, and youth lectures on radio stations.

    2. On February 21st, organize small-scale commemorative meetings, seminars, etc. as much as possible to publicize the above points. Colonial youth living locally can be invited to participate in these meetings.

    3. In large cities, write letters in the name of youth to the youth of colonial countries, expressing warm support, taking larger factories, schools, or organizations as units. Please have the letters written and sent to us before February 15th.

　　青年团全国青联学联发出通知
    纪念反对殖民制度斗争日
    展开广泛宣传鼓舞反帝斗争
    【新华社北京四日电】中国新民主主义青年团中央委员会、中华全国民主青年联合总会、中华全国学生联合会于二月一日联合发出《关于纪念“反对殖民制度斗争日”的通知》。通知全文如下：
    （一）二月二十一日是世界民主青年反对殖民制度斗争日，它标志着全世界爱好和平民主的人民反帝斗争的高涨及各殖民地半殖民地国家被奴役青年争取自由解放的意志。紧接着反法西斯战争结束后民族解放运动的发展，印度海军于一九四六年二月二十一日起义，反对英国帝国主义。第二年同一天，埃及学生因为要求英国军队退出埃及，遭到残杀。一九四八年东南亚青年会议在同一期间召开，提出了“帝国主义从亚洲滚出去”的口号。由于二月二十一日与殖民地青年反帝斗争有密切关系，因此，在同年秋天在波兰举行的青年联盟的理事会上，正式规定二月二十一日为“支援殖民地青年斗争日”。国际学生联合会也于每年号召各国学生积极参加这一运动。自世界民主青年联盟第二次代表大会以后，二月二十一日被称为“反对殖民制度斗争日”。
    （二）今年纪念二月二十一日是在中国人民已经战胜帝国主义及国内反动力量，取得了具有历史意义的胜利；越南、缅甸人民的解放战争获得重大的战果，解放了大部分的国土；马来亚、菲律宾、印度尼西亚的人民坚持着艰苦游击战争，反对帝国主义及国内反动派的统治；印度、伊朗等国家的人民在极端残酷的恐怖与迫害下，争取真正的民族独立与人民最基本的权利；全世界殖民地与半殖民地国家的人民在以美国为首的帝国主义的疯狂榨取下日益觉悟与组织起来，反对帝国主义把经济危机的负担加在他们身上，反对帝国主义利用殖民地的人力资源进行侵略战争准备。这说明了殖民地与半殖民地人民在以苏联为首的强大的世界和平民主力量与中国革命的胜利的鼓舞下，认识到只有在工人阶级的领导下依靠武装的斗争才能取得自由独立，并把民族解放斗争与世界和平运动结合起来。中国青年纪念“反对殖民制度斗争日”，就应该普遍地宣传殖民地半殖民地人民及青年反帝斗争的意义，说明这个斗争是整个世界争取和平民主斗争的一个重要组成部分，它的进展与胜利无疑地要加强世界反对帝国主义的民主阵营的力量，并且帮助中国人民巩固已经取得了的胜利，粉碎帝国主义利用东南亚殖民地国家作为进攻新中国的基地的阴谋。我们中国有将近一千多万侨胞在马来亚、菲律宾、暹罗、澳洲及越南法国占领区等地，备受帝国主义及其在各地的走狗的排斥、虐待与屠杀，中国青年要支援与慰问这些国家的青年侨胞，号召他们团结起来，与当地人民结成反对帝国主义的统一战线。
    （三）为着通过“反对殖民制度斗争日”宣传与鼓舞殖民地青年反对帝国主义的斗争，各地应即开始有计划地在广大青年中开展宣传活动，并根据具体情况采取以下办法：
    一、通过青年杂志报纸及广播电台的青年讲座，进行宣传。
    二、在二月二十一日，尽可能地组织小型的纪念会、座谈会等，宣传上述各点，这些会里可邀请当地侨居的殖民地青年参加。
    三、在大城市中，以较大的工厂、学校或机关为单位，用青年名义，写信给殖民地国家的青年，表示热烈的支援，信件望于二月十五日前写好寄给我们。
