　　Northeast China and other regions' public factories and mines
    Strengthen safety and sanitation facilities
    Andong City's public factories universally establish safety organizations
    Guarantee the completion of the 1950 production tasks
    [Our Newspaper News] Comprehensive News: To protect state property and the safety and welfare of employees, and to complete the task of restoring and developing industrial production in 1950, the state-owned and public factories and mines in the Northeast provinces and Shandong are gradually strengthening their safety and sanitation work.

　　The Liaodong Provincial Public Security Department held the first provincial economic security work conference from January 8th to 11th. Participants included responsible public security cadres from fourteen light industrial factories, such as the Andong Paper Mill and the Fuxian No. 4 Textile Factory, nine non-ferrous metal mines, such as the Xiuyan Dalitzilingzi Lead Mine and the Zhuanghe Furong Copper Mine, and four mines, such as the Xi'an Coal Mine and the Linjiang Dalizi Iron Mine. The meeting criticized the serious existing paralysis in various factories and mines. It summarized the work experience of eleven factories and mines' safety teams. The conference required all factories and mines in the province to universally establish safety teams before March. As of now, more than fifty public factories in Andong City under its jurisdiction have established safety organizations. At the founding meeting of the safety committee of the state-owned Andong Rubber Factory, five workers who had made meritorious contributions to protecting machinery were rewarded, eight people who should be held responsible for accidents were punished, and two saboteurs were reported.

　　The state-owned Hegang Coal Mine in Songjiang Province actively improved labor conditions and security work in the movement to create new records. Each pithead of the mine is equipped with a hygienist to deal with accidents in a timely manner in case they occur. Latrines have been universally established in each mine pit, and the accumulated feces on the pit lanes have been cleaned, making the air in the pit cleaner. The Mining Bureau has also built ten complete respirators. The coal carts in the South Mountain Mine of the mine have been universally equipped with safety hooks, and train runaway accidents have been eliminated for more than a month.

　　In order to cooperate with the development of the new record movement, various factories in Lushun and Dalian have strengthened their labor insurance work, which has greatly reduced work-related injuries and improved work efficiency. Safety committees have been universally established in thirty-one units, such as the Lushun-Dalian Middle-Long Railway Bureau. According to statistics from the Lushun-Dalian Public Security Bureau, the number of fires decreased by 47.3% last year compared with the previous year, and the loss decreased by 92%.

    Jiawang Coal Mine in Shandong Province Establishes Safety Inspection Responsibility System
    The Shandong Provincial People's Government's Department of Industry and Mining also held a safety work conference in January this year. It summarized the safety work in the past six months from ideological and management aspects, and criticized the incorrect thinking of some industrial and mining enterprises that neglected safety work. It also commended the mines that had achieved results in safety work. For example, the Xihe Coal Mine specially selected thirteen cadres to do safety work in the second half of last year, so the number of work-related injuries in September decreased by 68% compared with June. The meeting unanimously emphasized that in the current industrial and mining work, carrying out safety work is of paramount importance to guaranteeing production. Since January of this year, the Jiawang Coal Mine in the province has had eight accidents in a row, such as coal trucks derailing and electric winch chains breaking. This has aroused serious attention from the mine's leadership, and three specific measures have been formulated to improve safety: 1. The Mechanical and Electrical Department is responsible for checking the coal truck safety hooks, chains, and other underground mechanical equipment, and repairing or remaking any unsafe equipment. 2. The Mining Department is responsible for inspecting the mine lanes. In principle, each mine lane should have a pedestrian lane. If a pedestrian lane cannot be repaired, an insurance hole should be opened to prevent accidents and injuries. 3. Establish a top-down special person responsibility system and inspection system. The Mechanical and Electrical Mining and other departments should draw special personnel to form an underground safety inspection team, and coordinate with the Security Section to specialize in inspecting underground safety. At the same time, conduct thorough inspections of mechanical equipment, etc. in various places on weekdays. Once an accident occurs, responsibility must be investigated and a strict reward and punishment system must be implemented.

    Zhangjiakou City Focuses on Inspecting Safety Equipment
    On January 5th, the Safety and Sanitation Committee of various factories in Zhangjiakou City, Chahar Province, invited the Zhangjiakou City Labor Bureau, Health Bureau, Public Security Bureau, Fire Brigade, City Federation of Trade Unions, Provincial Enterprise Company and other departments to organize a winter factory safety and sanitation inspection team to conduct key inspections of fire prevention and anti-poisoning (coal gas poisoning) facilities in various factories. A total of six units were inspected. It was believed that the factories had paid more attention to winter fire prevention work, but it had not yet formed a mass movement. In the future, we should further mobilize all employees to take action and establish a strict organization and a strict system. Safety equipment should also be continuously improved. For example, the alcohol factory should set up more sand and soil bags, clear the dry grass in the yard, and implement special management of electrical switches. The Telecommunications Bureau should check and organize the wires and repair the asbestos in the boiler room, etc.

　　东北等地公营工矿
    加强安全卫生设施
    安东市各公营工厂普建安全组织
    保证完成一九五零年生产任务
    【本报讯】综合消息：为保护国家资财与职工福利安全，完成一九五○年恢复与发展工业生产的任务，东北各省及山东等地正逐步加强各国营、公营工厂及矿山安全卫生工作。
    辽东省公安厅曾于一月八日到十一日召开全省第一次经济保卫工作会议，与会者有安东造纸厂、复县第四纺织厂等十四个轻工业工厂、岫严大土岭子铅矿、庄河芙蓉铜矿等九个有色金属矿及西安煤矿、临江大栗子铁矿等四个矿山的公安负责干部。会上批判了各工厂矿山严重存在的麻痹思想。总结了十一个工厂、矿山安全小组的工作经验，会议要求全省各工厂矿山在三月份前普遍建立安全小组。该省所属安东市，截至目前为止，已经有五十多个公营工厂建立起安全组织。国营安东橡胶厂，在安全委员会成立大会上，奖励了五名保卫机器有功的工人，处罚了八名对事故应负责任者，检举了两名破坏分子。
    松江省国营鹤岗煤矿在创新纪录运动中，积极改善劳动条件与保安工作。该矿每一坑口均配备了一个卫生员，防备万一发生事故及时处理。各矿坑内普遍建立了便所，扫清了坑道上的积粪，使坑内空气清洁。矿务局并建设了十台完整的救命器。该矿南山矿煤车已普遍设备安全钩，一个多月来已消灭了跑车事故。
    旅大各厂为配合开展新纪录运动，各厂均加强了劳动保险工作，使工友损伤事故大为减少，提高了工作效率。旅大中长路局等三十一个单位，普遍建立了安全委员会。据旅大公安总局统计，去年较前年减少火灾次数百分之四七．三，损失减少百分之九二。
    山东省贾汪煤矿建立安全检查负责制
    山东省人民政府工矿部于今年一月间也举行了安全工作会议。从思想上和管理方面总结了半年来的安全工作，批判了某些工矿忽视安全工作的不正确思想。也表扬了对安全工作获得成绩的矿山。如西河煤矿，去年下半年专门抽调了十三名干部作安全工作，因此九月份工伤较六月份减少了百分之六十八。会上一致强调在目前工矿工作中，开展安全工作对保证生产具有头等重要意义。该省贾汪煤矿，自今年一月接连发生煤车脱钩及电绞车链断等八次事故后，已引起该矿领导上严重注意，并订定三项改善安全具体办法：一、机电科负责检查煤车保险钩、链条及其他井下机械设备，不保险的即修理与重做。二、矿务科负责检查坑道，原则上各坑道均应有行人道，不能修行人道的要开保险洞，以防止出事故伤人。三、建立自上而下的专人负责制和检查制，由机电矿务等科抽专人成立井下安全检查组，并和保安股联系配合，专事检查井下安全。同时，平日对各处机械设备等作周密检查，一旦发生事故，一定要追究责任，并进行严格的赏罚制度。
    张家口市重点检查安全设备
    察哈尔省张家口各工厂安全卫生委员会，于一月五日邀请张市劳动局、卫生局、公安局、消防队、市总工会、省企业公司等部门，组织了冬季工厂安全卫生检查小组，到各工厂作防火、防毒（煤气中毒）设施的重点检查。共检查了六个单位。认为各厂对冬季防火工作已比较注意，但尚未能形成群众性的运动。今后还应进一步发动全体职工大家动手，建立严密的组织与严格的制度。在安全设备上也应继续改进。如酒精厂应多设沙土袋，清除院内干草，应实行电闸专责管理。电信局应检查与整理电线，修理锅炉房的石棉等。
