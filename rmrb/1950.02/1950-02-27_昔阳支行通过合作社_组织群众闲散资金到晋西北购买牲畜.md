　　[News Report] The Former Yang Branch of the People's Bank of China issues loans through cooperatives to help the masses purchase livestock. Last winter, the branch decided to first assist farmers in Taoqu, Xizhuang, and Yanzhuang villages in purchasing livestock based on the supply and marketing business plan, and lent a sum of grain and funds to the cooperatives in each village. In order to absorb idle funds in rural areas, the bank also organized cooperatives to encourage members to deposit surplus agricultural products into the cooperative. Together with the products purchased by the cooperative, these were transported to Shizhuang, Yangquan and other places through the county federation of cooperatives to be exchanged for cloth. The cloth was then transported to the livestock-producing areas of northwestern Shanxi to purchase livestock. After the livestock were brought back, they were first sold to cooperative members; those who had money would buy, and those who did not would be lent money. In order to reward grain-depositing households, it was stipulated that cooperative members who deposited grain had priority in buying livestock. If members were unwilling to buy livestock, the cooperative would pay interest on the stored grain. This method motivated many members to deposit circulating funds into the credit department of the cooperative. According to statistics from the three cooperatives, a total of 9,760 jin of grain was absorbed from members. Adding the 3,200 jin of grain from the cooperative itself, the 13,000+ jin of grain loaned by the bank, and loans of 3 million yuan, the plan is to buy back 38 head of livestock this year, and 15 have already been purchased. When members of the Gaoluo Cooperative in the Fifth District saw how good this method was, they also asked the cooperative to help them buy livestock. Bank branch cadres seized the opportunity and loaned 8,100 jin of grain using the "loan in kind, repay in kind" method, combined with the cooperative's own 1,600 jin of stored grain, and absorbed 2,400 jin of grain from members to buy livestock in the livestock-producing area. The preliminary plan is to buy back 15 head of livestock. This method of the Former Yang Branch of issuing loans through cooperatives to help members purchase livestock will play an important role in this spring's agricultural production.

　　昔阳支行通过合作社
    组织群众闲散资金到晋西北购买牲畜
    【本报讯】中国人民银行昔阳支行通过合作社发行贷款，帮助群众购买牲畜。该行去年冬季根据供销业务计划，决定首先帮助桃躯、西庄、阎庄三村农民购买牲畜，贷给各村合作社一部粮款。为吸收农村闲散资金，银行并组织合作社吸收社员将剩余农产品存入社内，连同合作社所收购的产品，通过县联社运到石庄、阳泉等地换成布匹；再将布匹运到晋西北产畜区换购牲口。牲口贩回后，首先卖给社员，有钱的就买，没钱的就贷。为了奖励存粮户，规定存粮社员有买牲口的优先权。如社员不愿买牲口，合作社按存粮付息。这种办法带动了不少社员将游资存入了合作社信用部。根据三个社的统计：共吸收社员存粮九七六○斤。加上合作社本身的粮食三二○○斤和银行贷粮一万三千余斤及贷款三百万元，计划今年要买回牲口三八头，现已买了十五头。五区皋落合作社社员看见这种办法好，也要求合作社帮助他们买牲口。银行支行干部就抓紧机会，用贷实还实办法贷给粮食八一○○斤，结合该社本身的存粮一六○○斤，又吸收社员存粮二四○○斤，去产畜区买牲口。初步计划要买回牲口十五头。昔阳支行这种通过合作社发放贷款为社员添购牲口的办法，对今春农业生产将起重要作用。
