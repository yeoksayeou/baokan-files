　　On News in Newspapers
    (Written by Soviet L.K. Bluntman, Translated by Shen Jiang)
    Four. Basic Requirements for News
    Every word of news, just like any other material in a newspaper, should be politically significant, urgently needed, and purposeful. News should demonstrate the greatness of Soviet people and their new attitude towards labor and socialist property, and show the growth of Soviet people's thoughts and culture. News should educate millions of working people in the spirit of communism. It goes without saying that to successfully complete this task, journalists themselves must constantly improve their ideological and political level.
    News must be absolutely knowledgeable, not only literally, but also in substance. If describing a scientific discovery or production movement, every word must be credible, so that no expert reading the news would feel that the newspaper is ignorant.
    Experience shows that many journalists, when encountering new problems and trying to show off their "learning," overuse specialized terminology. Most of the errors in newspapers lie in our incorrect description or naming of something. And every such seemingly insignificant error in wording will cause protests from readers. Try writing e2—c4 instead of e2—e4 in a news item about chess, and you will receive hundreds of letters, in which readers—from Young Pioneers to chess experts—will sympathetically explain to the editorial department that pawns cannot move that way. As long as some incorrect explanation is used in any other area—for example, geology, architecture, metallurgy—the editorial department will immediately receive many protests.
    Of course, journalists cannot be polymaths. But precisely because of this, they should constantly learn, improve their ideological and political level, and expand their knowledge. Kalinin said in a conversation with journalists that correspondents should be the most knowledgeable people in a state. Kalinin pointed out, "It cannot be otherwise." But at the same time, in some editorial departments, the least skilled and least educated journalists are doing interviewing work. They provide gray, dull, and depressing material, and sooner or later bring major mistakes to the editorial department.
    It is appropriate to implement a system so that no news on specialized topics is published without prior consultation. There can be paid consultants, or simply knowing who to consult about a certain issue. But in all such cases, the truthfulness of the facts should be checked, the grammar of the chronicles checked, and the correctness of the terminology checked. This prevents any inaccuracies, errors, and the naturally resulting unpleasantness. The timeliness of publication and the urgency of the work should not be used to justify errors, because newspaper work is always tense.
    News must be as concise as possible. News articles differ from essays in that they should not persuade readers with arguments, but with the logic of facts. This is precisely the logic of events and the logic of life that Lenin attached great importance to. After writing a news item, it is very beneficial to look at whether there are superfluous details, unnecessary details that clog the main points, and, as the saying goes, squeeze out the "water." Sometimes it is necessary to discard several entire repetitive paragraphs. Sentences can almost always be compressed to make them more powerful and clear.
    This certainly does not mean that details are not needed in news, or that news excludes imagery, vivid comparisons, and successful maxims. On the contrary, the better the news is written, the stronger its impact on readers. Here is an example of a news item about furniture production from Kirov, sent by a TASS correspondent. This is a seemingly unremarkable topic, although it is undeniably a needed topic. But the reporter found a very successful approach.
    "Fifty years ago, after Leo Tolstoy first saw the Vyatka furniture manufacturers, he ordered the Viennese and French furniture in his study to be moved out and replaced with comfortable, elegant, wicker chairs and sofas made by Vyatka peasant handicraftsmen. This was a well-deserved evaluation for the skilled furniture makers."
    This is a truly excellent opening. The author then narrates that the Vyatka handicraftsmen have equipped the Minsk Soviet House, the Artek children's camp in Crimea, and hotels in the Urals with furniture, and are now completing furniture orders for the residences of coal miners in our eastern regions. The news item talks about the work of the largest cooperative, lists its products, and reports on the mechanization of production. This is a good and interesting news item.
    News should definitely have an effect. News is a "fragile item." A very interesting manuscript can be submitted, and the manuscript can be written extremely beautifully, but if it is sent to the editorial department or published too late, it becomes unnecessary for anyone. News is usually related to some event, and news is practical in its essence. What is the point of writing about a meeting two or three weeks after it has opened? Or what is the point of a newspaper suddenly appearing about a sports competition after it has been held, people have already dispersed home, and started working? The requirement for the freshness of manuscripts should be strictly observed.
    Of course, there can be news items that are not related to a certain event but have other themes. But even in this case, the news should be based on the latest materials and must start from the common tasks on today's agenda.
    Often reporters blame poor communication and try to justify their poor work with this. It can be asserted that there is no situation or place where it is impossible to send manuscripts to the newspaper. Everyone knows that Soviet journalists have sent dispatches from ice floes in the Arctic, from the Kara-Kum Desert, and from the peaks of the Pamir Mountains. And the communication conditions in those places are worse than in the central states of our country.
    It is also worth mentioning the work of military correspondents, especially during the offensive. At that time, the Soviet army advanced and occupied many cities, and it was necessary to immediately write articles and report to the editorial department about each city. The military correspondents wrote and reported. They sometimes used telephones, whenever possible; sometimes used radio; sometimes used direct lines; sometimes sent dispatches or special messengers on passing planes; and sometimes personally flew to Moscow with urgent manuscripts. And now there is a correspondent sitting somewhere a total distance of fifty or sixty kilometers, and when the editorial department blames him for writing few manuscripts, he argues that it is difficult to communicate...
    Just listing the methods of communication available in any region is enough to convince people of their abundance. The most convenient, understandably, is the telephone. The telephone can be used to quickly send manuscripts, with the editorial department's stenographer directly taking dictation. Telegraph, especially telefacsimile, is a reliable old tool. We have now established many radio reporting stations, which are often free and can be used to send urgent telegrams to the editorial department. There are regular air routes connecting all major centers across the country. Airplanes are not rare visitors in rural areas.
    One can use passers-by, train conductors, and car drivers to forward large manuscripts and photographs. One should just not optimistically hope that the passers-by will immediately go to the editorial department and find the people they need as soon as they arrive at their destination. It is best to write the editorial department's telephone number on the envelope, and also send a telegram to the editorial department asking them to send someone to find the letter carrier and pick up the package.
    Five. Accuracy is the Basic Rule of News
    The requirement for the accuracy of news manuscripts is special and extremely rigid. Everything published in the newspaper, from beginning to end, should be absolutely and unconditionally true and undeniably reliable. Otherwise, the used manuscripts will bring not benefit but harm to the newspaper—to the cause of the Party entrusted to us Bolshevik journalists.
    It is of course impossible to devise a system that naturally guarantees that newspapers avoid inaccuracies and errors. The whole problem lies in the internal mobilization of the writers and the sense of Party responsibility for the cause entrusted to the journalists. Every author and every editor should get used to comprehensively and meticulously checking manuscripts. It is necessary to check names, dates, cities, villages, areas, the names of enterprises and institutions, quotations, cited sentences, specialized terms, etc.
    Let's use a news item as an example to determine what should be checked. Here is a short report about the 125th anniversary of the birth of playwright Alexander Nikolaevich Ostrovsky. The news item points out that the Maly Theater and its branch performed certain plays for the anniversary, and the Gorky Art Theater staged a play "Ardent Heart", which was first staged at the Gorky Art Theater twenty-two years ago. The Bolshoi Theater performed Serov's opera "The Power of the Fiend," which is based on Ostrovsky's play "Don't Live as You Please". The Bakhrushin Theater Museum held an exhibition. In the House of Writers, Stalin Prize winner writer B. S. Romashev gave a report. The All-Union Society for the Dissemination of Political and Scientific Knowledge held several lectures.
    It should be checked: whether Ostrovsky's name and patronymic are correct, whether the Art Theater is indeed named after Gorky, whether the names of Ostrovsky's plays are quoted correctly, whether Serov really wrote the opera, whether the name of the opera is that, whether it is based on the theme of Ostrovsky's play. Determine the year of the Art Theater's first performance of "Ardent Heart" according to literary historical materials, determine whether there is a Bakhrushin Theater Museum according to reference materials, whether the name of the museum is that, whether the name of the House of Writers is that, check in the bound volumes of the newspaper whether Romashev received the Stalin Prize, whether he is a writer, whether the abbreviations of his name are correct.
    This necessary check can largely prevent newspapers from being inaccurate and making errors.
  Six. Sources of Errors in Newspapers
    Errors that are difficult to detect by routine checks occur during the author's writing of the manuscript, at various stages of the subsequent editorial processing of the original, and during copying, typesetting, etc. Therefore, it is very beneficial to investigate how errors generally arise, to propose typical situations that contain the danger of errors, and to point out the simplest preventive measures.
    What is the most common danger that harms authors?
    First of all, it is overconfidence in one's memory. Some journalists take almost no notes and check nothing. One impression harms him, which is that he thinks he understands everything very well, or understands everything very well. He especially often has this feeling when he meets a talkative interlocutor. The talkative interlocutor narrates clearly and specifically to the point that recording is not needed at all. But when the journalist later sits down to write, the names become unclear, and the dates and names are distorted. From this, it can be concluded that one should never rely on memory, one must record everything, and one must check everything before sending the manuscript to the editorial department and before the manuscript is typeset.
    Practice has shown that most errors in newspapers are in reports. What dangers are there here to trap the author? First, it is best to prevent the unthinking use of report outlines and plans. It is extremely common for these outlines, which the speaker compiled in advance, to be revised before the speech, for examples to be replaced with more obvious ones, and for numbers to be corrected to be more accurate. Therefore, if you only narrate the content of the report based on the outline, you will embarrass the newspaper. The same is true for the program of the meeting. It is also common for certain reports to be canceled for various reasons, and for other reports to be included in the agenda, and for a different speaker rather than the scheduled speaker to speak.
    There was once an educational incident. A correspondent sent news about the Soviet Academy of Sciences holding a meeting to study the productivity of the Molotov Oblast. One item on the agenda of the meeting was a report by Comrade So-and-so, the deputy minister. The correspondent pointed out in the report that Comrade So-and-so delivered the report. But later, it turned out that Comrade So-and-so suddenly fell ill on the eve of departure, so he stayed in Moscow, and the report was given by another deputy minister—Comrade A.
    In order to avoid this fatal confusion, the reporter must listen to the meeting and personally observe everything that happens. Even passive attendance is not enough to guarantee accuracy. The Moscow reporters remember very clearly the extremely unpleasant errors caused by some newspapers during the initial elections of the Supreme Soviet of the Russian SFSR. The situation was this: when a large enterprise in the capital held a pre-election meeting, the chairman announced that a non-Party female worker, Comrade Jemingjiva, would speak. This speech was clear and interesting, and was published by various newspapers. The next day, it became clear that Comrade Jemingjiva was not a non-Party comrade as reported, but a Party member who joined the Party in 1925. It turned out that the chairman at the time was a person who was not very familiar with the personnel of the enterprise, so he made a mistake when announcing who the speaker was.
    This kind of incident is common. The master of ceremonies sometimes says the last name incorrectly, sometimes says the first name incorrectly, and sometimes says the profession incorrectly. Therefore, it is best for the reporter to personally go to the speaker to find out his name, Party affiliation, profession, and task—in short, all the materials the reporter needs. Generally speaking, it is very beneficial to go to the speaker after he has finished speaking to correct one's notes—the names, titles, and numbers he cited, and the facts he cited. Sometimes the speaker will say something wrong. Sometimes, the typist makes a mistake in typing the outline, and the speaker mechanically cites incorrect material as she typed it when the debate is in full swing. The correction method recommended here can make the manuscript completely clear.
    The danger of errors in newspapers is often hidden in the desire to show off beautiful expressions, in the pursuit of "beautiful" images and unexpected comparisons. On December 30, 1947, a central Moscow newspaper published a long news item on the achievements of a Soviet fleet whaling in Antarctica. The author pointed out that "the fleet obtained hundreds of sea giants—whales, totaling one thousand kilometers in length." The editorial department liked this comparison and published it without taking the time to check it. But the readers checked it and wrote to the editorial department of another central newspaper, complaining about the ignorance of this news item.
    The reader pointed out in the letter that according to this news item, each whale is more than one kilometer long. The reader wrote: But the Great Soviet Encyclopedia confirms that whales average fifteen to twenty meters in length. The largest whale—the fin whale, is thirty meters long. Thus, if you believe the encyclopedia and assume that all the whales captured by the whalers were fin whales, then the fleet should have obtained 33,000 whales. But the news item states that a total of hundreds of sea giants were obtained. The reader asked, what should one believe? In this way, an unthinking comparison that was not measured with a critical eye embarrassed both the author and the newspaper.
    Sometimes, an error appears in the newspaper, the origin of which is explained as an incorrect association. For example, a newspaper in a republic published news about herding a group of livestock from Central Asia to the Astrakhan Oblast. When the author pointed out the route, he mentioned the Ustyurt sandy land. There is no such sandy land. How was this error made? It turned out that the author had heard that Ustyurt was a wasteland, and since it was a wasteland, he said, it was sandy land. However, Ustyurt is not a sandy wasteland but a stony wasteland.
    It is also extremely common for popular, "oral" sayings to appear in newspapers. Sometimes, the reporter arbitrarily creates the name of the district from the village he is reporting on instead of the district capital. Some people confuse industrial districts and administrative districts. Many streets have been renamed, but the old names are still printed in the newspaper. The reporter naturally wrote it that way because he was used to the oral name, and when he was about to correct it, he argued, insisting that "that's how everyone says it." It should be explained that although that's how everyone says it, that's not how it's written, and therefore it should be corrected. In this type of situation, one should always check reference books, and it is best to check the latest published reference books.
    One needs to be very careful with the work of sending manuscripts by telephone. It is difficult to guarantee that names, numbers, place names, and personal names are heard correctly if the line is not clear or the correspondent's transmission is not clear. This should be constantly reminded to the typesetters. Manuscripts sent by telephone need the most rigorous checking in terms of both facts and meaning.
    Not long ago, a newspaper published news from Stalinsk about the achievements of metallurgical workers, which said that steelworker Prutnikov had produced 18,000 tons of steel beyond the plan. A few days later, it became clear that it should have been written as 1,800 tons. The correspondent transmitted it correctly, but the reception was bad, and the stenographer made a mistake. Was it possible to detect the error in time? It was possible, because the news mentioned the names of other steelworkers who produced 900 tons beyond the plan. The disproportionately large number (18,000) should have attracted the attention of the comrades typesetting the manuscript.
    Telephone transmissions constantly contain the danger of mispronunciation, especially in names and titles. For example, sometimes ACCP (Azerbaijan Soviet Socialist Republic abbreviation – translator) is transmitted as CCCP (Soviet Union abbreviation – translator), Kirov City appears as Kirovsk City, Belgorod appears as Belgrade, etc. Therefore, when transmitting a dispatch by telephone, you must repeat the numbers two or three times. In the case of telephone transmission, numbers must be written out in words. Names and personal names are best repeated at the end of the dispatch. The reason for repeating the name at the end of the dispatch rather than immediately after the first mention is to prevent the operator who has made a mistake once from making a second mistake when the name is specifically raised again later. The most important names and titles are best transmitted letter by letter.
    Newspaper workers who let errors go sometimes blame the typist for making mistakes in the reliable original. Needless to say, typists also make mistakes in their work, but journalists cannot use this as an excuse to justify any errors. The copied manuscript should be treated as if it were seen for the first time, and read word by word with an attitude of looking for errors.
    It is best to check the materials quoted in the news based on the full text that has been revised and copied. Here is an example of news from the Irkutsk region about the graphite mine in the Sayan Mountains. The author wrote about the Podolsk mine. The editor checked the reference book to see if there was such a mine, revised the news in terms of wording, and sent it for copying. The typist typed it as "Porgelsky Mine". After receiving the copied material, the editor did not proofread it with the original and sent it for typesetting without checking the name a second time. The error went to the newspaper.
    The copied manuscript should be checked most rigorously and comprehensively and proofread with the original. This applies equally to both authors and editors.
    Many errors arise because we treat expectations as reality and turn tomorrow's events into yesterday's events. This is sometimes due to negligence, and sometimes because reporters do not check what they say, or interview news from people who are not well-informed. One should never reassure oneself that the manuscript was obtained from an official agency. Anything that can be checked should be checked again and checked against other reference books.
    A few words also need to be said about approving manuscripts for publication. Correspondents often believe, and even some editorial departments sometimes believe, that if the manuscript has been reviewed by a certain responsible comrade, or approved by him for publication, then there is no need to put any more thought into further checks. This is a harmful misunderstanding. Because they only look at the material generally and essentially, they are under no obligation to delve into the details, especially to check numbers, facts, place names, and personal names.
    In March 1948, Moscow newspapers received a manuscript about the achievements of Soviet aircraft model makers. According to the report, the International Aeronautical Federation had determined four world aviation records based on new rules, and these achievements belonged to Soviet aircraft model makers. Among the record creators, it was pointed out that Comrade Liubushkin, the top aircraft model maker in the Soviet Union in 1947, and Comrade Malik from Moscow. It is said that Comrade Malik also holds the world record for the endurance of seaplane models with automatic devices. This manuscript was approved for publication. But during the checking, it was found that the International Aeronautical Federation had not determined world aviation records, but world records for aircraft model making (accuracy in terminology plays a particularly important role in the classification of sports achievements). It was also found that the title of top aircraft model maker simply does not exist, and that the endurance record does not belong to Comrade Malik.
    It can be seen from this that approving a manuscript for publication does not prevent the author from making errors and inaccuracies.
    Seven. Editorial Department's Checking of Manuscripts
    The above reviewed some of the situations in which authors let errors go. But errors often also occur due to the carelessness of editorial department workers, or more accurately, due to an unclean and imprudent attitude towards their work. It is an unchanging rule for handling manuscripts to not only edit and make textual revisions to the received manuscripts, but also to check them comprehensively. It is the direct responsibility of the editorial department workers, deputy directors, and rhetoric editors who send the manuscripts for typesetting to conduct this check.
    In some large editorial departments, in addition to the above-mentioned personnel, there are also rhetoric checkers and special checking teams under the secretariat. But this does not mean that each department can not revise the manuscript before it is typeset. All factual materials must be checked: names, dates, names of cities and villages, etc. Without this rule, it is almost inevitable to make mistakes.
    Sometimes the situation is this: the editor sends the original for typesetting, but does not check it completely—sometimes because he does not have time, sometimes because he does not have a reference book on hand or the manuscript is not very urgent. The newspaper is a living and very agile organism. Sometimes, close to dawn, a manuscript is canceled and another manuscript is inserted, so the manuscript originally scheduled for tomorrow is used today. If an unlucky, unchecked news item is published, the result is an error in the newspaper.
    Sometimes, the editor sends the manuscript for typesetting, specifying "typeset in the morning," expecting to check all the facts in the afternoon when things are calm. The next day, another comrade is on duty, and he does not know that the manuscript has not been checked, thinking that everything that has been typeset has been corrected, and sends it to a certain page with peace of mind. In this way, the error "sneaks" into the newspaper again. Therefore, everywhere—whether in the secretariat or in each department—an absolute condition should be unconditionally enforced: only send thoroughly proofread originals for typesetting.
    Sometimes, the error is explained as: the comrade who publishes the manuscript trusts the original from an author who holds an important position or is known for his erudition too much, and this authoritative author, although he correctly states the basic propositions and argues his conclusions forcefully, is not completely accurate in details and facts.
    In this regard, a question may arise: is it necessary to proofread news manuscripts from various agencies? Yes, it is necessary. This check can find all kinds of inaccuracies.
    For example, on March 2, 1948, Moscow newspapers received news specifically about the publication of books on the history of opening up the Arctic. One point reported in the news was: "The famous Russian navigator Golovnin's masterpiece has now been published, and its content is the author's memoirs of his circumnavigation from Kronstadt to Kamchatka aboard the warship 'Diana' from 1907 to 1909." But after checking, it became clear: the navigator's last name was not Golovnin, but Golovnin, aboard "Diana" from Kronstadt to Kamchatka; not from 1907 to 1909, but from 1806 to 1809.
    This news item mentioned that the book "History of Arctic Voyages" by L. F. Rakteonov had been published. It should be corrected: the abbreviation before the author's name is not L. F., but A. F., the author's last name is not Rakteonov, but Rakgionov, and the title of the book is not "History of Arctic Voyages", but "Arctic". The fact itself is true: the author wrote the book and the book has been published.
    The checking should not only extend to certain statements, and be unrelated to other statements, and leave various specialized names or dates to the author's responsibility. All names, titles, dates, and document quotations should be checked, no matter who quotes them. Any author, including experts, is required to have proof, correct materials, and authoritative investigation. Errors and inaccuracies in the manuscripts of leading workers or experts are more detrimental than errors and inaccuracies in ordinary newspaper news.
    Errors are often also explained as manuscripts being revised carelessly. Let's assume that the author wrote a sentence that is not very fluent: "In this regard, it should be particularly pointed out the outstanding comrades Antonov, Ivanov, Filippov, etc.". You decide to simplify this sentence, not writing "In this regard, it should be particularly pointed out the outstanding" and changing it to "Especially outstanding are", but not changing the author's text afterwards. In this way, men become women! (Translator's note: Here is a problem with Russian grammar changes, that is: "Antonov, Ivanov, Filippov" These personal names after the verb "point out", according to Russian grammar, its writing has changed to "Antonova, Ivanova, Filippova", if the verb "point out" is deleted and the subsequent text is not changed, then the word "娃" will remain, and the word "娃" is the suffix of a female last name.) This error is very typical.
    In the process of making textual revisions, manuscripts are often compressed, discarding unnecessary details, unmoving examples, and superfluous explanations. In this case, there is a great danger of mechanically compressing entire paragraphs. Sometimes, a paragraph that initially seems to have little meaning has an important idea at the end, and the next paragraph supplements and develops this idea.
    There is also a situation where, initially, there is a long and tedious series of arguments on a certain issue, but the author later starts talking about something completely different without any transition. In one dispatch, the initial topic was the achievements of young Stakhanovite workers in the Gorky Automobile Plant, and in the next paragraph, tedious and poorly chosen facts about the work of young forgers were listed; later, it was said that the same production enthusiasm could be seen among young Stakhanovite workers in the Magnitogorsk Plant. The subsequent two paragraphs put forward very meaningful examples of the achievements of Stakhanovite workers in the Magnitogorsk Plant. During the revision, the paragraph about the forgers was completely discarded. In this way, a steel casting workshop that did not actually exist unexpectedly appeared in the Gorky Plant, mentioning steelworkers who produced beyond the plan and mentioning names that no one knew in the Gorky Plant. As a result of the mechanized compression of the full text, the examples from the Magnitogorsk Plant were superfluous for the people in the Gorky Plant.
    Finally, we should talk about the so-called natural errors in using selected manuscripts. For example: now there is a report about a certain event (such as about a congress, a conference, a play, the opening of a power station, a football match), the original text states that this event occurred "yesterday", but for some reason the manuscript was not used and was used the next day, and the two words "yesterday" were forgotten to be revised, and they were published in the newspaper like that.
    Let's give another example. In a news item that was typeset in, for example, late November, the labor achievements of Stakhanovite worker Iconov were described, and it was pointed out that he would produce a certain number of products "this month". Subsequently, this news was held up for a few days and published without modification (it was only necessary to mechanically change the date in the first line). In this way, all the facts about November were mechanically transferred to December.
    Let's give another example! For example, an article was typeset in December. The author pointed out that the year had passed victoriously, and that certain factories and agricultural areas had completed their plans ahead of schedule "this year", but the article was published late, and it was already the second year, and the two words "this year" were in the middle of the article, and they were not noticed and not corrected, thus creating a joke.
    The conclusion is: the entire text should be read line by line before publishing the manuscript on a certain page.
    The analysis of errors and inaccuracies in newspapers has shown that errors and inaccuracies are always the product of carelessness, inattention, and a non-serious attitude towards work. Errors are the result of rushing, carelessness, and complacency. The Central Committee of the Party most absolutely requires the editorial departments and all workers of newspapers to completely eliminate not only errors in meaning and fact, but also typographical inaccuracies.
    As early as twelve years ago, Comrade Molotov pointed out when reporting at the meeting of editors of central and local newspapers that bureaucratic and incorrect news often seeps into newspapers along with decent news. Comrade Molotov said, "News should be checked and criticized. It is not permissible to have different numbers reported on the same issue in our newspapers." (See "Collection of Bolshevik Press" Volume 2, page 181)
    Our job, the direct responsibility of Bolshevik newspaper work, is to be vigilant at all times, show constant caution, and check every word we publish in the newspaper.
  Eight. The Journalist's Notebook
    Almost at any meeting where there are several journalists present, you can see their different attitudes towards their work. One person takes notes in a notebook, another person takes notes in a practice book, a third person takes notes on a piece of paper, and a fourth person takes notes on the back of the agenda or topic. What this divergence proves is not that the various correspondents have different creative attitudes towards reporting, but that some comrades lack the skills to do cultural work. It can be said that one thing is almost certain, that is, the journalist who takes notes on a small piece of paper will not check the speech and make the names and facts more certain, because he does not have a fixed working system; carelessness is his style.
    Is it better to write notes in a notebook or in a practice book? It is better to use a practice book. Because notebooks are inconvenient to record and are not strong enough binding, and the pages are easy to fall apart.
    Everyone knows that writers pay a lot of attention to their notebooks. They record images, comparisons, interesting facts, rare names, and insightful sentences in their notebooks—the "savings" needed for future works. Writers take notes, which is to store things that will be needed later. But the journalist's notebook is different from the writer's notebook, most often containing things that need to be used now, today. Therefore, the main things in it are: the basic facts about the interviewees, speakers, characters, and protagonists in the dispatch or news item, impression descriptions, and all materials. Of course, materials that can be used in the future are not completely unrecorded.
    How to take notes? This is a personal matter, but one should always record as much as possible. Kalinin advised when talking with young peasant writers in 1934: "You need to observe the environment you want to describe every day, pay attention to the various characteristics and the sayings you like, and record everything in your notebook. All of this should be recorded in detail, and you can use it when necessary. All the great writers have a large number of these notes." (See "Collection of Articles and Speeches of the Sixth to Seventh Soviet Congress", published by the Party Publishing Bureau, page 247)
    At the beginning of each note, indicate the date, location, and cause of action. If successful images are produced, appropriate descriptions are accumulated, and clear comparisons flash during a meeting, conversation, or observation of an event, be sure to record them. Otherwise, although you can spend a few hours carefully recalling the sentences you once liked later, it is always difficult to restore that sentence in your memory. Proverbs, aphorisms, and the telephone numbers of interviewees heard on the street and in the factory are best recorded at the end of the notebook, and then recorded separately in other notebooks and practice books when you have free time.
    It is very beneficial to review notebooks often. At this time, redundant things (notes that are only meaningful for one day) should be discarded, and the rest should be sorted out. If time permits, it is best to compile a directory in front of the notebook (on the three or four blank pages left in advance), because skilled reporters often have to go back to their previous notes. This can enable people to cite analogies, build a bridge between today and several years ago, and make broad generalizations.
    A classified telephone directory on the table and in the pocket with the telephone numbers of all or almost all the people you may need to find is very helpful for the reporter's work. You should know the office telephone numbers and residential numbers and addresses of various workers, and what time it is easier to find him at home or during working hours. The telephone numbers of experts who can be consulted on various issues should be recorded separately.
    Now let's talk a few words about what reporters need to have. Only use a fountain pen or fountain pen to take notes indoors. On the street and in the field, it is best to take notes with a pencil, because it may rain, and the ink handwriting will be smudged and difficult to read. A black soft pencil is better. You should bring not one pencil, but several pencils, to prevent the pencil from becoming blunt, breaking, or being lost.
  × × ×
    A lot can be said and written about what position news should occupy in newspapers and what news should be like. Our reality presents Soviet journalists with a boundless ocean: countless sharp questions, requiring Bolshevik journalists to enthusiastically and actively participate in the construction of a new life.
    In this glorious era of the post-war Stalin Five-Year Plan, when all Soviet people are fighting with infinite enthusiasm for our motherland to move most rapidly towards communism, our job position is particularly important and valuable. The task of newspapers, the task of journalists, is to help the most rapid realization of various great Stalin plans with the great power of fiery Bolshevik words, with all the means of propaganda and agitation we possess, and with all the weapons in our professional arsenal.

　　论报纸上的消息
    （苏联Ｌ·Ｋ·布朗特曼作  沈江译）
    四  对消息的基本要求
    消息的每一个字，也正像报纸上任何其他材料一样，应该是有政治意义的，急需的，有目的的。消息应该表明苏维埃人的伟大性及其对劳动和对社会主义财产的新态度，表明苏维埃人思想和文化的成长。消息应该以共产主义精神教育千百万劳动群众。不言而喻，要胜利地完成这一任务，便也要新闻记者自己不停地提高思想、政治水平。
    消息必须是绝对有学识的，学识不仅是在这两个字的字面上，而且是在实质上。如果描述什么科学发现或生产运动，便要使每一个字全都可以凭信，使任何一个读到这条消息的专家也不会感觉报纸是不学无术的。
    经验说明，许多新闻记者在碰上新问题和力图炫“学”之时，滥用了专门术语。报纸上的错误，几乎大多数在于我们对什么东西叙述得不正确或称呼得不正确。而每一个这种表面上不显明的用语错误，都会引起读者的抗议。请试在关于象棋的消息中写下不是e2—e4，而是e2—c4，你便会收到成百的来信，在这些来信中，读者——从儿童团员到象棋专家——将会同情地向编辑部解释卒子是不能那样走的。只要在任何其他方面——譬如说，在地质学、建筑学、冶金学方面——使用了一个什么不正确的说明，编辑部便立即会收到许多抗议。
    自然，新闻记者不可能是多方面的博学之士。但正因为如此，所以他应该不断地学习，提高自己的思想、政治水平，扩大自己的知识。加里宁在一次和新闻记者的谈话中说，通讯员应该是一州中最有学识的人。加里宁指出，“非如此不行”。但同时，在若干编辑部中，最不熟练的和受教育最少的新闻记者都在作采访工作。他们提供灰色的、乏味的、沉闷的材料，并且或早或迟地给编辑部带来重大的错误。
    实行一种制度，使关于专门主题的消息没有一条不经过事先咨询然后发表，是很适宜的。可以有拿薪水的顾问，可以只是知道关于某某问题应当向谁请教。但在所有这一类情况下，都应该检查事实的真实性，检查纪事的文法，检查术语的正确性。这便预防了任何不确实、错误以及随之而来的自然而然的不愉快。不应该用发稿的时间性与工作的急要性来为错误作辩解，因为报纸工作总是紧张的。
    消息必须尽可能简练。消息稿件和文章不同，不应该用议论来说服读者，而应该用事实的逻辑来说服读者，而这就正是列宁曾给予了极大重要性的那种事件的逻辑和生活的逻辑，在写好消息后，再看看其中是否有多余的细节，不需要的，淤塞主要东西的细节，并像俗话说的一样，榨去“水”，是很有益处的。有时候需要抛弃若干整个重复的段落。几乎随时总可以压缩句子，使之更有力而明确。
    这当然并不是说消息中是不需要细节的，或消息是排斥形象、鲜明的比较、成功的格言的。相反的，消息写得愈好，对读者的影响便愈强。下面便是塔斯社一个通讯员从基洛夫所发关于家具生产消息的例子。这是似乎并不很动人的主题，虽然是无可争辩地需要的主题。但记者找到了非常成功的处理态度。
    “五十年前，列夫·尼可拉耶维奇·托尔斯泰第一次看见了维亚茨基的家具制造商后，便吩咐将自己书房里的维也纳的和法国的家具搬出去，换上方便的、雅致的、维亚茨基农民家庭手工业者所制造的圈椅和沙发。这对于有技巧的家具商是一个应得的估价了。”
    这真是优异的开场白。作者继而叙述维亚茨基的家庭手工业者为明斯克的苏维埃之家、克雷姆的儿童营“阿尔确克”、乌拉尔的旅馆装备了家具，现在则在完成我国东部地区煤矿工人住宅的家具订货。消息中谈到了最大的合作社的工作，列举了它的出产品，并报导了生产的机械化。这是一则很好的有趣的消息。
    消息应该是一定起作用的。消息是“易碎品”。可以提出非常有趣的稿件，把稿件写得极漂亮，但发给编辑部的时间或发表的时间却迟得使之对于任何人都成为不需要的了。消息通常是和一种什么事件相联系的，消息在其本质上是实用的。在一个会议开幕两三个星期后才写关于该会议的东西，到底有什么意思呢？或是在一种什么体育竞赛举行过了、人们早已四散回家、开始工作以后，却突然出现了关于这一竞赛的报纸，这又到底有什么意思呢？应该非常严格地遵守稿件的新鲜性的要求。
    当然，不与某某事件相联系而另有主题的消息，也是可能有的。但就是在这一情况下，消息也还是应该以最新的材料为基础，一定要从正是今日议程上的共同任务出发。
    往往有记者归咎于联系不好，并试图以此而为自己工作得不好作辩解。可以断言，不能向报纸发稿的情况和地点是没有的。大家都知道，苏维埃记者从北极的冰块上，从卡拉·库姆沙漠中，从帕米尔山峰上都发出过通讯。而那些地方的联系条件比我国的中心各州总要坏些。
    不妨也提到军事通讯员的工作，尤其是在进攻时期军事通讯员的工作。当时，苏军向前突进了，占领了许多城市，而关于每一个城市都需要立即写稿并向编辑部报道。军事通讯员们又写稿了，又报道了。他们有时候使用电话，只要可能的话；有时候使用无线电；有时候使用直通电话；有时候用顺路的飞机发通讯或派出专差；有时候亲自带着急要的稿件飞赴莫斯科。而现在是在总共距离五六十公里的一个什么地方坐着一个通讯员，当编辑部责备他写稿很少时，他却辩解说难以联系。……
    只要列举一下任何地区都有的联系方法，便足够使人相信其丰富了。最方便的，可想而知，是电话。电话可以使人迅速的发稿，口授编辑部的速记员直接笔录。电报、特别是电报传真器是可靠的老工具。现在我们建立了许多无线电通报台，这些电台常常有空，可以借以向编辑部发急要的无线电报。全国各大中心之间均有定期的航空线相联系。飞机在农村地区也不是稀罕的客人。
    可以利用顺路者、火车管理员、汽车司机转送大稿件和照片。只是不应该乐观地希望顺路者一到达目的地便立即去找寻编辑部和需要的人们。最好在信封上写下编辑部的电话号码，此外，并向编辑部打电报，要编辑部派人去找这个带信的人并向他取包裹。
    五  准确性是消息的基本规则
    对于消息稿件的准确性的要求是特殊的、极硬性的。报纸刊载的一切，从头到尾，都应该是绝对地无条件地确实的，无可非议地可靠的。否则，所用稿件便会带来不是益处而是害处给报纸——给委托予我们这些布尔什维克新闻工作者所从事的党的事业。
    要想出一种制度自然而然地保证报纸避免不准确和错误，当然是不可能的。全部问题乃在于文字工作者的内心的动员，及对交给新闻记者的事业的党性责任感。每一个作者，每一个编辑，都应该习惯于全面而缜密地检查稿件。必需检查姓名，日期，城市，村庄，区域，企业与机关的名称，引用文，引证句，专门术语等等。
    我们试用一则新闻为例来确定应该受到检查的是些什么。这里是一则关于剧作家亚力山大·尼古拉耶维奇·奥斯特洛夫斯基一百二十五周年诞辰纪念的一则不长的报道。消息指出，小剧院及其分院在纪念日演出了某些剧本，高尔基艺术剧院上演了一出戏“热心”，这一出戏曾经在二十二年前首次在高尔基艺术剧院上演过。大剧院则演出了谢洛夫的歌剧“恶魔”，这歌剧是根据奥斯特洛夫斯基的剧本“切勿随心所欲”的主题改编的。巴赫鲁深戏剧博物馆举办了展览会。在文学家大厦里，斯大林奖金的获得者作家Ｂ·Ｓ·罗玛舍夫作了报告。全苏政治与科学知识传播协会举办了若干讲演。
    应该检查：奥斯特洛夫斯基的名字和父名是否不错，艺术剧院是否确实是冠以高尔基的名字的，奥斯特洛夫斯基的剧本的名称引用得是否正确，谢洛夫是否真正写作了这个歌剧，该歌剧的名称是否是那样的，是否是以奥斯特洛夫斯基的那个剧本的主题为根据的。按照文学史料确定艺术剧院首次上演“热心”的年份，按照参考材料确定是否有巴赫鲁深戏剧博物馆，该博物馆的名称是否是那样的，文学家大厦的名称是否是那样的，根据报纸的合订本查清楚罗玛舍夫是否领得了斯大林奖金，他是不是作家，他的姓名的略写字母是否不错。
    这种必需的检查，大可以预先使报纸避免不确实和错误。
  六  报纸上的错误的来源
    在作者写作稿件的过程中，在随后编辑部处理原作的各阶段，在复写付排等等时，都有通常的检查难以发现的错误发生。因此，调查错误一般是怎样产生的，提出包含错误危险的典型情况，并指明最简单的预防方法，是很有益的。
    最常见的有害作者的是什么危险呢？
    这首先是过份信任自己的记忆力。有的记者几乎什么笔记也不作，什么也不检查。一种印象害了他，这便是他以为他什么都非常明白，或非常懂。当他碰上一位健谈的交谈者时，他尤其是常有这种感觉。健谈的交谈者叙述得明白而具体到好像完全不需要记录的地步。但当该记者后来坐下来写稿时，姓名弄不清了，日期和名称弄歪曲了。由此可以得一结论，永远不应该依赖记忆力，一定要什么都笔记下来，并在送稿件给编辑部及稿件付排以前，一定要什么都经过检查。
    实践表明了：报上错误大部分是报道上的。在这里是些什么危险要陷害作者呢？首先最好预防不加思索地利用报告的提纲及计划。演说者事先所编就的这些提纲在发言前修改了，例子更换得更明显了，数字改得更准确了，乃是极常见的事情。因此，假使只是根据提纲来叙述报告的内容，是会使报纸受窘的。对于会议的程序，也同样要批判地看待。根据种种理由，某些报告被取消了，另外一些报告被列入议程中了，不是预定的演说者而是另一个演说者发言了，也是常有的事情。
    曾经有过一次有教育意义的事件。一个通讯员发出了关于苏联科学院开会研究莫洛托夫州生产力的消息。该会议议程上有一项是副部长某同志作报告。通讯员在报导中便指出了这位某同志发表了报告。而后来的情况是，某同志在启程前夕突然患病，便留住在莫斯科了，报告是由另一个副部长——甲同志去作的。
    为了避免这种致命的混乱，记者一定要旁听会议，亲自观察所发生的一切。甚至消极的亲自到会还不足以保证准确性。苏俄最高苏维埃初选时，若干报纸所造成的令人极不愉快的错误，莫斯科的记者是记得很清楚的。情况是这样的：首都的一家大企业举行选举前的会议时，主席宣布由一个非党女工捷明吉瓦发言。这篇演说很明朗、很有趣，各报都刊载了。第二天，弄明白了：原来捷明吉瓦同志不像报导中所说是非党同志，而是一九二五年入党的党员。原来当时作主席的是一个对该企业的人事不大熟悉的人，因此，他在宣布演说者为谁时弄错了。
    这种事件是常见的。会议的司仪有时候把姓讲得不正确，有时候把名字讲得不正确，有时候把职业讲得不正确。因此，记者最好亲自到已发言者那里去弄清楚他的姓名、党籍、职业、任务——总之，记者所需要的一切材料。一般地说，在演说者发言完毕后就到他那里去校正自己的笔记——他所引用的姓名、名称与数字，他所引证的事实，是很有益的。有时候演说者会把话说错。有时候，打字员在复写提纲的时候把数字弄错了，而演说者在辩论正热烈时机械地照她所打下的那样，引用了不正确的材料。这里所推荐的校正办法，是可以使稿件完全明确的。
    报上错误的危险往往也隐藏于想炫耀漂亮说法的愿望中，隐藏于对“美丽的”形象和出人意外的比较的追求中。一九四七年十二月三十日，莫斯科一家中央报纸刊载了一篇长消息，论及了在南极捕鲸的一支苏联舰队的成绩。作者指出，“该舰队获得了几百个海中巨人——鲸鱼，共长一千公里。”编辑部喜欢这一比较，没有费时间检查一下便予以刊载了。但读者检查了，并写信给另一中央报纸的编辑部，申诉这一则消息的无知。
    这位读者在信中指出，根据这条消息判断，每一头鲸鱼长一公里以上。这位读者写道：但是大苏维埃百科全书确称，鲸鱼平均长十五至二十公尺。最大的一种鲸鱼——鳁鲸，长三十公尺。这样，如果相信百科全书，并认为捕鲸者连续捕捉到的全是鳁鲸，则该舰队应该已获得三万三千头鲸鱼。但在消息中却说明共获得了几百头海中巨人。读者问道，叫人究竟相信什么好呢？这样，不加思索的，未用批判眼光衡量过的比较，使作者和报纸都窘住了。
    有时候，报纸上出现一种错误，其起源据解释是不正确的联想，例如在一个共和国的报纸上发表了关于赶一群牲畜从中亚细亚赴阿斯特拉汉州的消息。作者指出行程时，提及了乌斯基乌尔茨基沙地。这样的沙地是没有的。这一错误是怎样造成的呢？原来是作者曾听说乌斯基乌尔特是荒地，既然是荒地，他说，那就是沙地了。然而，乌斯基乌尔特却不是沙子的荒地而是石头的荒地。
    流行的、“口头的”说法上了报纸，也是极常见的事情。有时候，记者武断地从所报道的村庄而不是一区的首府来制造该区的名称。有人把工业区和行政区混淆起来。许多街道都改名了，而旧的名称却仍旧登在报纸上。记者自然而然地那样写下了，因为习惯了口头的称呼，而在要改正时，他便争辩，坚称“都是那样说的”。应该解释，虽然都是那样说的，但不是那样写在文字上的，从而应该予以改正。在这一类情况下，随时应该查参考书，并且最好是查最新出版的参考书。
    需要非常小心地对待电话传发稿件的工作。在听得不清楚或通讯员传话不明晰的情况下，很难担保名称、数字、地名和人名收听得不错。这一点是应该向付排者随时提醒的。用电话传来的稿件在事实和意义两方面都需要最严格的检查。
    不久以前，某报发表了斯大林斯克地方所发关于冶金工人成绩的消息，其中说，炼钢工人普鲁特尼科夫超计划出产了一万八千吨钢。几天以后，情况弄明白了：原来应该写为一千八百吨。通讯员传发得倒是对的，但收听情况不好，速记员弄错了。是否可能及时地发觉错误呢？是可能的，因为在这个消息中提到了超计划生产了九百吨的其他炼钢工人的姓名。大得不相称的数字（一万八千），原应该吸引将稿件付排的同志注意的。
    电话传发稿件随时含有读音错误的危险，尤其是在姓名和称呼上。例如有时候在ＡＣＣＰ（亚塞拜疆苏维埃社会主义共和国简称——译者）传成ＣＣＣＰ（苏联简称——译者），基洛夫城出现为基洛夫斯克城，贝尔哥洛德出现为贝尔格莱德等等。因此，当要用电话传发通讯的时候，一定要把数字重复两三遍。在用电话传发的情况下，一定要用文字写出数字。名称和姓名最好在通讯末尾重复一下。之所以要在通讯末尾而不是紧随着第一次提及后重复姓名，是为了使已弄错了一次的报务员在后面又特别提出名称时不致于第二次再弄错。最紧要的姓名和名称，最好一个一个字母分开传发。
    放过了错误的报纸工作者，有时候诿过于打字员弄错了可靠的原文。不用说，打字员在工作上也是会有错误的，但新闻记者不能以此作为辩解任何错误的理由。对复写的稿件应该以仿佛第一次看见这稿件一样的态度来对待它，要抱着寻找错误的态度逐字阅读。
    最好根据修正后已经复写的全文来检查消息中引用的材料。这里便是伊尔库茨克地方所发关于萨扬斯基山地石墨矿消息的例子。作者写了波果多尔斯基的矿山情况。编辑查了参考书，看看是否有这样的矿，在文字方面修正了这个消息后便发交复写了。打字员打成了“波果尔斯基矿”。编辑收到复写的材料后，没有用原文校对，没有第二次检查名称便付排了。错误便到报纸上去了。
    应该最严格地全面检查复写的稿件，并用原文校对。这对于作者和编辑都是同等适用的。
    许多错误之所以产生，是因为我们以预料为现实，把明天的事变成了昨天的事。这有时候是由于疏忽，有时候是因为记者不检查所说的东西，或是从消息不够灵通的人们那里采访了消息。从来不应该安慰自己道，稿件是从官方机关取得的。凡是可以检查的，便应该再检查，根据其他参考书检查。
    关于批准发稿，还必需说几句话。通讯员往往认为，甚至若干编辑部也有时候认为，如果稿件经某某负责同志审查过，或经他批准发稿了，便可以不必再用心思作进一步的检查了。这是有害的误解。因为他们只一般地、本质地看材料，完全没有义务深究细节，尤其谈不上检查数字、事实、地名与人名。
    一九四八年三月，莫斯科报纸收到一个关于苏维埃飞机模型制造家的成绩的稿件。据报道，国际航空协会在新规则的基础上，决定了四项世界航空最高纪录，这些成绩是属于苏维埃飞机模型制造家的。在创造纪录者中，据指出有苏联一九四七年飞机模型制造家的最高选手留布石金同志及莫斯科人马立克同志。据说，马立克同志并保持带有自动机的水上飞机模型续航力的世界纪录。这一稿件被批准发出了。但在检查的时候发现，国际航空协会所确定的不是世界航空最高纪录，而是飞机模型制造业的世界纪录（在运动成绩的分类法上，用语的准确性起着特别重大的作用）。更发现飞机模型制造业最高选手这个称号根本就不存在，而续航力纪录更不属于马立克同志。
    由此可见，批准发稿并不能使作者避免错误和不确实。
    七  编辑部对稿件的检查
    上面检讨了作者放过错误的若干情况。但错误往往也由于编辑部工作者的粗心，而更准确地说，是由于对业务的不整洁与不慎重的态度。对于所收到的稿件不仅加以编辑并作文字上的修改，而且还全面地检查，乃是处理手稿的不变法则。进行这种检查，是将稿件付排的编辑部工作者、正副部主任和修辞编辑的直接责任。
    在一些大的编辑部中，除有上述人员外，并在秘书处下设有修辞检查员及特设检查组。但这并不使各部在稿件付排前可以不对稿件加以修正。一切事实材料都要检查：姓名、日期、城市和村庄的名称等等。没有这一规则，便几乎不可避免地要铸出错误来。
    有时候情况是这样的：编辑把原文付排了，但没有完全检查——有时候是因为没有时间，有时候是因为手头没有参考书或是稿件不很急要。报纸是活生生的、非常敏捷的有机体。有时候在快到天亮时候又取消一项稿件而放入另一稿件，那么原定明天用的便要今天用了。如果发了倒霉的、没有校正的消息，结果便是报纸上出错误了。
    有时候，编辑把稿件付排了，规定“早上排出”，预计在下午，在平静无事的情况下再检查一切事实。次日，另一同志值班，他不知道稿件没有检查，以为排好的都是校正过了的，心安理得地发给某版使用了。这样，错误便又“潜入”报纸了。因此，到处——在秘书处也好，在各部门也好——都应该无条件地执行一项绝对的条件：仅仅把彻底校正过了的原文付排。
    有时候，错误是被这样解释的：由于发稿的同志太信任居要职或以博学闻名的作者的原文，而这一有地位的作者虽然正确的陈述了基本命题，有份量地辩论了自己的结论，但在细节上和事实上表现得是不完全确实的。
    在这方面，可能产生一个问题：是否需要校正来自各机关的消息稿件呢？是需要的。这种检查可以发现种种不确实。
    例如一九四八年三月二日，莫斯科各报收到了专论开辟北极史的书籍出版的消息。该消息所报道的有一点是：“俄国名航海家哥洛温的巨著现已出版，内容系作者乘兵舰‘吉亚那’号于一九○七年至一九○九年自克隆斯达赴堪察加作寰球旅行时的回忆。”但经检查后弄清楚了：航海家的姓不是哥洛温，而是哥洛夫宁乘“吉亚那”号从克隆斯达赴堪察加；不是在一九○七年至一九○九年，而是一八○六年至一八○九年。
    这一消息中述及了，Ｌ·Ｆ·拉克捷翁诺夫所著《北极旅行史》一书已出版。应该修正：作者的姓前面的略写字不是Ｌ·Ｆ·，而是Ａ·Ｆ·，作者的姓不是拉克捷翁诺夫，而是拉克吉翁诺夫，书名不是《北极旅行史》，而是《北极》。事实本身则是真实的：作者写了书，书已出版了。
    检查不应该仅及于某些说法，而与另一些说法无关，并把种种专门名称或日期留交作者负责。应该一定要校正一切姓名、名称、日期、文件引用句，无论是谁引用的。对任何作者，包括专家，都要求要有证明，有正确的材料，有权威的调查。居领导地位的工作者或专家的稿件中的错误及不准确，较之平常的报纸消息中的错误及不准确更不利些。
    错误往往也被解释为稿件修改得轻率。我们假定作者写了这样一句不十分流畅的句子：“在这方面，应该特别指出杰出的安多诺夫、伊万诺夫、费利波夫等同志”。你决心要简化这个句子，不写为“在这方面，应该特别指出杰出的”等字而改作“尤其杰出的是”，后面却不更动作者的文字。这样，男人便变成女人了！（译者按：此处系俄语文法变化的问题，即：“安多诺夫、伊万诺夫、费利波夫”这几个人名在“指出”这一动词后面，按俄语文法，其写法已变化为“安多诺娃、伊万诺娃、费利波娃”，如删去“指出”这一动词而不更改后面的文字，则“娃”字便保留下来了，而“娃”字是女性的姓的字尾。）这一错误是十分典型的。
    在作文字上的修改的过程中，常常压缩稿件，抛弃不需要的细节，不动人的例子，多余的解释。在这一情况下，机械地压缩整个整个段落，便有很大的危险。有时候，初看觉得意义很小的一段，其末尾却含有重要的思想，而下一段便是补充和发展这一思想的。
    也有这种情况发生：起初是很长而乏味的关于某一问题的一连串议论，作者后来不加任何转折却开始谈完全别的东西了。在有一篇通讯中，最初谈的是高尔基汽车工厂中青年斯达哈诺夫工作者的成绩，而在下一段中，则列举着关于青年锻冶工人工作的、乏味而且选择得不好的事实；后来又说到在马格尼托高尔斯克工厂的青年斯达哈诺夫工作者中也可见同样的生产热忱高涨。其后两段提出了关于马格尼托高尔斯克工厂中斯达哈诺夫工作者的成绩的非常有内容的例子，在修改中，关于锻冶工人的一段完全抛弃了。这样，在高尔基工厂中便出人意外地出现了实际上不存在的铸钢车间，述及了超计划生产钢的冶炼工人，提到了在高尔基工厂中谁也不知道的姓名。机械化压缩全文的结果，马格尼托高尔斯克工厂的例子，对于高尔基工厂的人便是多余的了。
    最后，应该谈一谈在使用已选定的稿件时所谓自然而然的错误。例如：现在有一篇关于某一事件的报道（如关于代表大会，代表会议，演戏，电力站开工，足球赛），原文中述及这一事件发生于“昨日”，但因故该稿没有用上而用于次日了，“昨日”两字忘了修正，便那样上了报纸。
    让我们再举一个例子。在一篇例如说是十一月底付排的消息中，描述了斯达哈诺夫工作者伊可诺夫的劳动成绩，并指出，他“本月份中”还将生产若干产品。随后，这一消息被扣压了几天，又未加修改地刊用了（只需要在第一行机械地更改一下日期）。这样，关于十一月份的一切事实，便机械地转移到十二月份了。
    再举一个例子吧！例如有一篇文章是十二月间付排的。作者指出一年已胜利地过去了，某某一些工厂和农业区“今年”提前完成了计划，但该文章刊载迟了，已经到第二年了，而“今年”两字夹在文章中间的地方，没有发觉，没有修正，这样，便造成笑话了。
    结论便是：在刊用稿件于某版前，应该将全文逐行读清。
    对报纸的错误及不准确所作的分析表明了：错误及不准确总是对业务的不仔细、不用心、不认真的产物。错误是赶急、轻率、自慰的结果。党中央委员会最绝对地要求报纸的编辑部及一切工作者完全肃清不仅是意思上和事实上的错误，而且也是校对上的不准确。
    还是十二年前，莫洛托夫同志在中央报纸及地方报纸编辑会议上作报告时指出，官僚习气的、不正确的消息常常随同正派的新闻一道渗入报纸里去。莫洛托夫同志说，“消息是应该受检查的，受批评的。在我们报纸上关于同一问题有不同的数字报导，这种情况是不能容许的”。（见《布尔什维克报刊》文集第二册第一八一页）
    我们的职务，布尔什维克报纸工作的直接责任，便是随时警惕，表现出经常的谨慎态度，检查我们刊用于报纸上的每一个字。
  八  新闻记者的笔记本
    几乎在有几个新闻记者到会的任何一个会议上，都可以看出他们对待业务的不同的态度。有一个人在记事本上做笔记，另外一个人在练习本上做笔记，第三个人在一张纸上做笔记，第四个人在议程或论题的反面做笔记。这种分歧所证明的不是各通讯员对报道有不同的创作态度，而是若干同志缺乏作文化工作的技巧。可以说有一点几乎是确定的，就是，在一小块纸上笔记演词的新闻记者，将不检查演词，不使姓名，事实更为确实，因为他没有确定的工作制度；漫不经心，便是他的作风。
    笔记写在记事本上好，还是写在笔记本上好？用笔记本比较好。因为记事本不方便记载，装订也不够牢固，纸页容易散落。
    大家都知道，作家对于自己的笔记本是给予非常多注意的。他们在笔记本上记下形象、比较、有趣的事实，少见的姓名，警辟的语句——将来的作品所需要的“储蓄”。作家做笔记，这是储藏以后所需要的东西。但新闻记者的笔记本不同于作家的笔记本，最常见的是包含现在、今天就要用的东西。因此，其中主要的是：关于通讯中或消息中的交谈者、演说者、人物与主角的基本事实，印象描述以及全部材料。自然，也并非完全不记可备将来之用的材料。
    怎样做笔记呢？这是个人的事情，但总应该尽量多记。加里宁一九三四年和青年农民作家交谈时建议道：“需要天天观察所想描写的环境，注意种种特点及所喜欢的说法，将一切记入笔记本中。这一切应该记载得很详尽，必要时便可以利用。各大作家都是有大量这种笔记的。”（见党出版局出版《第六次至第七次苏维埃代表大会文章与演说集》第二四七页）
    在每一篇笔记的开头，要注明日期、行动地点、缘由。如果在开会时、谈话时或观察事件时产生了成功的形象，积累了恰当的描述，闪出了明朗的比较，一定要记下来。否则，以后固然可以花几小时的时间去细心回想曾经喜欢过的句子，但要在记忆中恢复那一句句子总是很难的。在街道上，在工厂中听见的格言谚语、警句，及交谈者的电话号码，最好记在笔记本的末尾，以后有空闲时再分记于其他各笔记本和练习本上。
    常常审阅笔记本是很有益的。这时赘物（只有一天的意义的笔记）应该抛弃，其余的应该整理一下。如果时间许可，最好在笔记本的前面（在预先留下的三四页白纸上）编下一个目录，因为熟练的记者常常要回转去看自己从前的笔记的。这可以使人引用类比，在今天与若干年前之间架起一道桥梁，做出广泛的概括。
    放在桌上的和放在荷包中的、有一切或几乎一切可能要找的人物的电话号码的分类电话号码本，对记者的工作是大有帮助的。应该知道各种工作者的办公处电话号码和住宅号码及其住址，及什么时间较容易在家中或在上班时间内找到他。可供咨询各种问题的专家的电话号码，应该分别记下来。
    现在谈几句关于记者所需要备有的东西吧！只是在室内才用钢笔或自来水笔做笔记。在街道上、在野外，最好用铅笔做笔记，因为可能下雨，墨水的笔迹会被渗散，阅读起来将很困难。铅笔用黑色软铅笔较好。应该带不是一枝铅笔，而是几枝铅笔，以预防铅笔钝了，坏了或掉了的情事发生。
  ×          ×          ×
    关于消息在报纸中应该占什么地位及消息应该是怎样的，可以说出和写出很多东西来。我们的现实向苏维埃记者提出了一片无涯际的海洋：无数的尖锐的问题，要求着布尔什维克新闻工作者热烈地积极地参加新生活的建设。
    当此实行战后斯大林五年计划的显赫年代，全体苏维埃人民正在以无限热忱为我们祖国最迅速地走向共产主义而斗争，我们的工作岗位尤其紧要而可贵。报纸的任务，新闻工作者的任务，是以火热的布尔什维克言论的巨大力量，以我们所拥有的一切宣传和鼓动的手段，以我们本行的武库中的一切武器，帮助种种伟大的斯大林计划最迅速地实现。
