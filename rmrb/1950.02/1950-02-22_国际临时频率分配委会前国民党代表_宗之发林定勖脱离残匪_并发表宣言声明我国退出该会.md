Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 21st -- This reporter has learned from the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications of the Central People's Government that Zong Zhifa and Lin Dingxu, former representatives of the Kuomintang government to the Provisional Frequency Board of the International Telecommunication Union in Geneva, have declared their withdrawal from the Board and severed relations with the Kuomintang remnants to serve the people's telecommunications. It is understood that the Provisional Frequency Board of the International Telecommunication Union in Geneva was convened by the Plenipotentiary Conference of the International Radio Administrative Conference held in Atlantic City, USA, in 1948. It has been working for more than two years, but due to the manipulation of the US representatives, the Board has repeatedly demanded that countries reduce their radio frequency needs by applying so-called technical principles, resulting in no results to date. The unreasonable demands of the US representatives regarding the reduction of radio frequency needs of other countries are unacceptable to the majority of countries in the Board. The Soviet Union and the Eastern European People's Democratic countries have successively withdrawn from the Board after severely criticizing it and demanding changes in working principles to no avail. Representatives Zong Zhifa and Lin Dingxu also issued a declaration on December 30th last year, stating that China would no longer participate in the work of the Board and would not be bound by any of its resolutions.

　　国际临时频率分配委会前国民党代表
    宗之发林定勖脱离残匪
    并发表宣言声明我国退出该会
    【新华社北京二十一日电】记者自中央人民政府邮电部获悉：前国民党政府出席日内瓦国际电信联合会临时频率分配委员会代表宗之发、林定勖已声明退出该会，并与国民党残余断绝关系，为人民电信服务。按日内瓦国际电信联合会临时频率分配委员会系一九四八年在美国大西洋城召开的国际无线电行政会议全权代表大会所决定召集，已工作两年余，但因美国代表的操纵，该会借施用所谓技术性原则，一再要求各国减少无线电频率需要，致至今毫无结果。美国代表关于减少其他国家无线电频率需要的无理要求，为该会多数国家所不能接受。苏联及东欧人民民主国家在对该会进行严厉批评，并要求改变工作原则无效后，已相继退出该会。宗之发、林定勖两代表亦于去年十二月三十日发表宣言，声明中国不再参加该会工作，并不受该会任何决议案的束缚。
