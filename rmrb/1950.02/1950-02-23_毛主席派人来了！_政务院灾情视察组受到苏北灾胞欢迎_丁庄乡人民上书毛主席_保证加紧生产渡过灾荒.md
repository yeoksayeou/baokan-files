　　Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, February 21st: "Chairman Mao has sent people!"
    The Government Administration Council's Disaster Inspection Team Welcomed by Subei Disaster Victims; People of Dingzhuang Township Write to Chairman Mao, Guaranteeing Intensified Production to Overcome the Famine

　　After the Government Administration Council's Political and Legal Committee Disaster Inspection Team arrived in Subei, they went deep into the severely affected areas for days, visiting households and were warmly welcomed by the disaster victims. The disaster victims excitedly spread the word: "Chairman Mao has sent people!" The inspection team arrived in Yangzhou on January 17th, traveled north along the Grand Canal to Shuyang County, a severely affected area, on the 21st, and on the 26th, split into groups to go deep into the front, middle, and rear villages of Dingzhuang Township in the county, conducting investigations and offering condolences to severely affected households and families of revolutionary martyrs, soldiers, and working cadres. When the inspection team arrived in the township, the cry of "Chairman Mao has sent people!" quickly spread throughout the three villages. Sun, an old man in his fifties, and his old sister hurriedly went to the gate to greet the inspection team comrades when they were visited, and said to the comrades of the inspection team, "Chairman Mao is truly a great savior. He cares about us so much; we will never forget him." Sun Wenzeng, an old man of a military family, also said to the inspection team comrades with emotion and full of confidence: "Ninety-nine days have passed out of a hundred days of great difficulty, are we still afraid of not getting through the last day!" The disaster victims in the township were all digging *fuzi* grass roots in Shijia Pond in the afternoon, and the inspection team comrades went barefoot into the pond to visit them. That evening, more than sixty cadres and residents gathered to chat about how to step up production to overcome the famine. Farmer Qiu Shiting said, "In previous years, we suffered from the Jiang disaster and floods, and there were five years of famine in a row. If it hadn't been for Chairman Mao's leadership, the people here would have starved to death long ago. Now we have been distributed land, and if we don't have seeds to plant, the government lends us seeds, if we don't have cattle, we borrow cattle, and if we don't have clothes, we distribute clothes, hairpins, and brooms. We have borrowed everything. If we don't work hard to produce and only rely on government relief, then we will be letting down Chairman Mao." Everyone immediately scrambled to say, "We can't finish talking about Chairman Mao's kindness to us in three days and three nights." They unanimously expressed that they would achieve "no idle houses in any village, no idle people in any household" to repay Chairman Mao's kindness. Immediately, everyone wrote a letter and entrusted the inspection team to take it to Chairman Mao, guaranteeing that they would step up production and overcome the famine.

　　“毛主席派人来了！”
    政务院灾情视察组受到苏北灾胞欢迎
    丁庄乡人民上书毛主席  保证加紧生产渡过灾荒
    【新华社北京二十一日电】政务院政法委员会灾情视察组到达苏北后，连日深入重灾区挨户访问，受到灾民热烈的欢迎。灾民们兴奋地奔走传告：“毛主席派人来了！”视察组于一月十七日到扬州，二十一日沿运河北上到重灾区沭阳县，二十六日分组深入该县丁庄乡前、中、后三村，对重灾户和革命烈士、军人和工作干部的家属进行调查和慰问。当视察组到达该乡时，“毛主席派人来了！”的声音很快地就传遍了三个村子。五十多岁的孙老爹和他的老妹，在被访问时急忙到大门口迎接，并向视察组的同志说：“毛主席真是大救星，他这样关怀我们，我们永远忘不了他。”军属孙文增老爹也感动地并且满怀信心地对视察组同志说：“百日大难过了九十九，最后一天怕还熬不过吗！”该乡灾民下午都在施家荡挖芙子草根，视察组同志便赤脚下荡访问。当晚六十多个干部和居民集会漫谈如何加紧生产渡荒。农民仇士廷说：“前些年遭蒋灾、水灾连荒了五年。要不是毛主席领导，我们这里的人早就饿死了。现在我们分得了土地，种地没种子政府贷种子，没牛贷牛，没衣裳发放衣裳、钗把、扫帚，样样都贷过。我们再不下劲生产，单赖政府救济，那就对不起毛主席了。”大家立即争相说：“毛主席给我们的恩情，三天三夜也说不完。”一致表示要做到“庄庄没闲房，家家无闲人”来报答毛主席的恩情。当下大家就写了一封信托视察组带给毛主席，保证加紧生产，渡过灾荒。
