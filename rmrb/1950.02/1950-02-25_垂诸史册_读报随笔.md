　　"To Be Recorded in History" - Reading the Newspaper
　　Yan Ling
    The American warmonger, former commander of the Western Pacific Fleet, Kirk, at the invitation of the war criminal Soong Mei-ling, while speaking at a Kuomintang remnant air force base in Taiwan, greatly praised the running dogs of the American imperialists, saying that their "work" of bombing Shanghai "will be recorded in history for hundreds of years to come." This unreservedly announced to the world that the American imperialists were the commanders of the Kuomintang remnants' bombing of Shanghai, Nanjing, and other places. The American imperialists are so jealous and hateful of the Chinese people who have been liberated and no longer allow the imperialists to ride on their heads, wishing they could bomb the Chinese people to extinction. Thousands of Shanghai citizens died under American bombs, and the American imperialists hurriedly smiled sinisterly and issued awards to their executioners. But the Chinese people are very sure that at least one thing Kirk said is absolutely correct: the "deeds" of the murderers will surely be "eternally recorded in history"--the people of Shanghai and all of China will never forget this blood debt, this account must be written in history; not only these murderers, but also their instigators. However, history will also record how the Chinese people made these war criminals receive the punishment they deserved.

　　“垂诸史册”——读报随笔
　　燕凌
    美国战争贩子前西太平洋舰队司令柯克应战犯宋美龄之请在台湾国民党残匪某空军基地讲话时，大大夸奖了一番美帝国主义者的鹰犬，说他们轰炸上海的“工作”“将在今后数百年垂诸史册”。这毫不隐讳地向全世界宣布了，美帝国主义者是国民党残匪轰炸上海、南京等地的指挥官。美帝国主义者对解放了的不再让帝国主义者骑在头上的中国人民是如此嫉恨，恨不得把中国人民炸光。上海成千市民死在美国炸弹底下了，美帝国主义者就急忙狞笑着给他们的刽子手们发奖状。而中国人民则非常确信，柯克所说的话，至少有一点是错不了的：杀人犯们的“业（孽）绩”必将会“永垂史册”，--上海人民和全中国人民永远忘不了这血海深仇，这笔账必定要写在历史上的；不但这些杀人犯，还连带着他们的唆使者在内。不过，历史上也必同时记载着，中国人民是如何使这班战争罪犯们得到了他们应得的膺惩。
