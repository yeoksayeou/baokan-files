　　Beijing News: The Beijing Municipal People's Government is currently inspecting the work of the Public Health Bureau and the Public Works Bureau in order to improve work and gain experience from it, which can be promoted to other units of the municipal government to establish a planned work inspection system. After the Municipal Government Administrative Conference decided to first inspect the work of the aforementioned two bureaus, a work inspection committee was formed under the leadership of Deputy Mayor Wu Han and Secretary-General Xue Zizheng to formulate a work plan and carry out the inspection in a step-by-step manner. The Public Health Bureau and the Public Works Bureau have large organizations with more than twenty affiliated units. Over the past three weeks, during the process of deployment and mobilization, Deputy Mayor Wu Han repeatedly explained to the staff of the two bureaus and their affiliated units that the purpose of the inspection work is to use the weapon of criticism and self-criticism to stimulate the enthusiasm and creativity of all staff members to improve work efficiency, improve work style, establish a better labor view and discipline of serving the people, and exchange experience and summarize results. In order to enable the inspection staff and the inspected personnel to understand this spirit, the inspection committee also organized everyone to study documents such as "The Process and Gains of the North China Military Region's Inspection of the International Peace Hospital" and "Stalin on Leadership and Inspection." The personnel participating in this inspection work, in addition to the Municipal Government Personnel Department, the Investigation and Research Office, the Finance Bureau, the Public Health Bureau, the Public Works Bureau, and other units, also include the Ministry of Health of the Central People's Government, the Health Department of the North China Military Region, Peking University Medical College, and other units and experts, totaling more than 60 people, who formed three inspection groups for hospital work, public health, and environmental sanitation respectively. The scope of inspection includes business, finance, personnel, institutional establishment and other aspects. Each group has started work in units such as the Municipal Third Hospital, the First Health Office, and the Sanitation General Team since the 5th of this month.
