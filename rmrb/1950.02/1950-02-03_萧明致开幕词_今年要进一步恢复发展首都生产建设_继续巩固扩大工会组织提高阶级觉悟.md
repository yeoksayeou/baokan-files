　　Xiao Mingzhi Delivers Opening Speech
    This Year, We Must Further Restore and Develop Capital Production and Construction
    Continue to Consolidate and Expand Trade Union Organizations and Enhance Class Consciousness
    [Beijing News] Xiao Ming, Chairman of the Beijing Municipal Federation of Trade Unions Preparatory Committee, delivered the following full text of his opening speech: Since the establishment of the Beijing Municipal Federation of Trade Unions Preparatory Committee last "February 7th," under the direct and correct leadership of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, it has carried out trade union work for the past year; organized more than 180,000 workers, led the city's workers in restoring and developing production, and appropriately guaranteed workers' lives. It has conducted relatively systematic enlightenment education for workers, enhanced the class consciousness of the working class, and participated in various construction projects in the capital. This time, 471 representatives were elected, and today we are holding the first Workers' Congress. The central tasks of this congress are: to summarize the trade union work of the past year, to adopt organizational regulations, to establish a leading body—the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, and to determine the central tasks of trade union work in the future. This task has been clearly pointed out to us by Comrade Peng Zhen, Secretary of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, in his "Celebrating the First Anniversary of the Liberation of Beijing": "The ultimate goal of the revolution is to liberate the productive forces and develop production," and he pointed out that "organizations such as trade unions must regard leading employees to actively produce, improve production technology and labor discipline as their primary task." At the same time, Comrade Peng Zhen also pointed out that "our education is to serve the masses of the people and to serve the restoration and development of production." Comrade Li Lisan, Vice Chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, also called on the working class across the country to prioritize production, do a good job in trade union work, enhance the class consciousness of the working class, and strive to build a new China. Therefore, in 1950, we must further restore and develop capital production, launch a production competition campaign to overcome the trauma and difficulties of the long-term war, and strive to build a new people's capital, continue to consolidate and expand trade union organizations, strengthen the education of the working class, enhance class consciousness, and promote the enthusiasm and creativity of the working class. We believe that all the representatives present have the determination and confidence to complete the guidelines given to us by Comrades Peng Zhen and Li Lisan and the glorious tasks given to us by the working class of the city.

　　萧明致开幕词
    今年要进一步恢复发展首都生产建设
    继续巩固扩大工会组织提高阶级觉悟
    【北京讯】京市首届工人代表大会主席萧明，开幕词全文如下：北京市总工会筹委会去年“二七”成立以来，在中国共产党北京市委会和全总的直接正确领导下，进行了一年来的工会工作；组织了十八万多工人，领导全市工人进行了恢复与发展生产工作，并适当的保证了工人生活。对工人进行了比较有系统的启蒙教育，提高了工人阶级的觉悟，参加了首都各种建设工作。这次选举出四七一个代表，今天在这里举行首届工代大会，这个大会的中心任务：要总结过去一年来的工会工作，要通过组织章程，要产生领导机构——市总工会，要决定今后的工会工作中心任务。这个任务，在中国共产党北京市委会书记彭真同志的“庆祝北京解放一周年”中已给我们明确指出：“革命的终极目的，是为了解放生产力，发展生产”并指出“工会等组织必须把领导职工积极生产，改进生产技术和劳动纪律当做自己的首要任务”。同时彭真同志还指出“我们的教育事业是：为了人民大众服务的，为恢复发展生产服务的”。中华全国总工会副主席李立三同志也同样号召全国工人阶级应以生产为第一，搞好工会工作，提高工人阶级的觉悟，为建设新中国而努力。所以我们一九五○年要为进一步的恢复与发展首都生产，开展生产竞赛运动，以克服长期战争的创伤和困难，为建设人民的新首都而奋斗，继续巩固和扩大工会组织，加强工人阶级的教育，提高阶级觉悟，发扬工人阶级的积极性与创造性。我们相信到会的全体代表，有决心有信心来完成彭真同志、李立三同志所指示我们的方针和全市工人阶级所给予我们的光荣任务。
