　　The sun was about to set. Old Ma was rushing to the representative meeting. As he walked down the street, he saw a crowd standing in front of a general store. Jin Bao Niang called out, "Old Ma! If you have time, please come to my house for a visit." Old Ma saw that everyone was looking at him. In such a situation, being invited by an improper woman to her house was infuriating. He scolded her, "I see you are a bad woman, you want me to think about you!"
　　(VI)
　　Old Ma's anger hadn't subsided even when he arrived at the representative meeting. The representatives noticed that Old Ma looked upset and asked him what was wrong. Old Ma recounted the whole story. The director of the representatives, Tian Laoda, said, "I don't think she has the courage to seduce the work team. Perhaps she really has something to say." As the attendees had not fully arrived, everyone began to discuss Jin Bao Niang's background. Only then did Old Ma learn what kind of woman Jin Bao Niang was.
　　(VII)
　　Jin Bao's father was named Li Genyuan. His family was very poor and rented more than twenty mu of land from the local landlord, Liu Guicai. When Genyuan was three years old, a family of refugees from another region came to Diantou Village. The woman in that family was pregnant.
　　(VIII)
　　Later, she gave birth to a little girl. The weather was getting colder, and she had no clothes, and was hungry. She couldn't afford to raise the child and planned to give her away. (Attached picture)
