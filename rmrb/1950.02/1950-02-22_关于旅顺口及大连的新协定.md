New Agreement on Lushunkou and Dalian
　　Hu Hua

　　A Brief History of Lushun and Dalian

　　Lushun and Dalian are located at the southern tip of the Liaodong Peninsula in Northeast China. Lushunkou is an excellent naval port, while Dalian is a commercial port. These two places were long occupied by Japanese imperialism. As early as the Sino-Japanese War of 1894, Dalian was once occupied by Japanese invaders. In 1898, Tsarist Russia "leased" Lushun and Dalian, building a naval port in Lushunkou with the blood and sweat of the Russian and Chinese working people. During the Russo-Japanese War of 1904, Russia was defeated, and Lushun and Dalian were seized by Japan, where they remained occupied for 41 years. In August 1945, the Soviet Red Army entered Northeast China and captured Lushun and Dalian, liberating them from the hands of the Japanese invaders, making them the territory of the Chinese people.

　　The Significance of the 1945 Sino-Soviet Agreement on Joint Management of Lushun and Dalian

　　According to the "Sino-Soviet Agreement on Lushunkou," signed simultaneously with the "Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship and Alliance" in August 1945, Lushunkou was designated as a naval base jointly used by China and the Soviet Union for 30 years, with the Soviet Union responsible for its defense, while civil administration remained under Chinese jurisdiction. The Soviet Union was allowed to station naval, land, and air forces in the area. As for Dalian? According to the "Sino-Soviet Agreement on Dalian," to ensure the Soviet Union's access to Dalian for its import and export of goods, Dalian was designated as a free port, and it was stipulated that during the state of war against Japan (i.e., before the signing of a peace treaty with Japan), Dalian would also be included within the scope of the naval base regulations stipulated in the Lushun Agreement, subject to military administration in the area.

　　The significance of this agreement is basically the same as that of the newly signed agreement. At that time, it was aimed at defeating Japan in the war against Japan, preventing Japan from engaging in aggression again after the war, and strengthening the common security of China and the Soviet Union. It was not a lease (because civil administration belonged to China), but a military cooperation, meaning that China and the Soviet Union would use this excellent seaport and solid fortress to effectively strike the Japanese army during the war against Japan, and after the war, they would jointly shoulder the responsibility of monitoring Japanese aggressors.

　　The facts of the past four and a half years have proved that this agreement is of great significance and very beneficial to the Chinese people. Because the Soviet army obtained the necessary conveniences on the main transportation line in Northeast China—the Chinese Changchun Railway—and the main seaports—Lushun and Dalian Ports—it effectively defeated the Japanese Kwantung Army and consolidated the victory in Northeast China. In the four and a half years since the war, the Lushun military port at the tip of this Liaodong Peninsula has been like a bayonet, aimed at the Japanese aggressive forces that the American imperialists are fostering, and also at the mortal enemy of the Chinese people who collude with the Japanese invaders—the Chinese reactionaries and the foreign imperialists who aid them. It has prevented the American imperialists and the Chinese reactionaries from invading, and has greatly consolidated the sea defense of the People's China.

　　In terms of the construction of the Lushun and Dalian areas themselves, it has also brought good news to the people there. Let's take a look at a reporter from the *People's Daily*'s report on the situation there:

　　"Now there are no beggars, no prostitutes, no thieves in Lushun and Dalian, and unemployment has been basically eliminated. By the end of next year, when the two-year construction plan is completed, illiteracy will also be basically eliminated. Industrial construction is advancing towards surpassing the highest level of the Japanese invaders. The Chinese Changchun Railway, glass factories, and many other enterprises have already surpassed it. Electric furnaces that could not be manufactured in the era of the Japanese invaders, gas pipes necessary for the chemical industry, and many other products have been manufactured here and are being produced continuously. Industries and factories that did not exist in the era of the Japanese invaders have been established in Lushun and Dalian and continue to be built. Agricultural production reached 173 percent of the production volume in 1945, the last year of Japanese rule. New universities and middle schools have been established, and primary schools are common in every remote village…

　　For four years, according to the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship and Alliance, the Soviet Red Army stationed in the Lushun and Dalian areas, under the direct leadership of its military headquarters, has provided meticulous and comprehensive assistance to the people of Lushun and Dalian..." (*People's Daily* reporter Tian Liu; "The Soviet Army in Lushun and Dalian," *People's Daily*, November 23, 1949)

　　Let's take a look at some of the views expressed by people from the business community after visiting Lushun and Dalian:

　　"Hu Juewen said: We personally went to Northeast China last year to investigate, and we personally saw that even in Lushun and Dalian, where the Soviet Union has troops stationed, the local administration is managed by the Chinese themselves. In the entire Northeast China region, there is absolutely no phenomenon of the Soviets interfering in China's internal affairs...

　　Yu Huancheng said: In Dalian, we saw that the municipal construction was done extremely well, and the restoration of factories and the increase in agricultural production were also very effective. In this regard, the Soviet friends have made great contributions...

　　Wang Yi, an accountant from Zhengming Accounting Firm, said: We personally saw that the Lushun and Dalian area is completely under the jurisdiction of the Chinese Lushun and Dalian Administrative Office. There are no beggars and no unemployment there. We all agreed that Lushun and Dalian is an area where New Democracy construction has been successful." ("Today's Northeast China"—Facts witnessed by members of the Shanghai business community's delegation to Northeast China, *People's Daily*, February 6, 1950)

　　There are countless similar reports praising the construction of Lushun and Dalian with Soviet assistance and the happiness of the people there.

　　The Significance of the New Agreement on Lushun and Dalian

　　Due to the establishment of the People's Democratic New China, the obstruction of the Kuomintang reactionary government has been eliminated, creating the possibility of further cooperation between China and the Soviet Union, two great powers. Therefore, the two countries have made new arrangements for the important issue of Lushun and Dalian.

　　According to Article 2 of the Sino-Soviet "Agreement on the Chinese Changchun Railway, Lushunkou, and Dalian": "The two contracting parties agree that once a peace treaty with Japan is concluded, but no later than the end of 1952, Soviet troops shall withdraw from the jointly used Lushunkou naval base, and the equipment in the area shall be transferred to the Government of the People's Republic of China, and the Government of the People's Republic of China shall pay the Soviet Union for the costs of restoring and constructing the aforementioned equipment since 1945." At the same time, this clause also stipulates: "Once either contracting party is subjected to aggression by Japan or any country colluding with Japan, and is thus drawn into military action, upon the proposal of the Government of the People's Republic of China and with the consent of the Soviet Government, China and the Soviet Union may jointly use the Lushunkou naval base to facilitate joint combat against the aggressor."

　　This clause fully demonstrates the great righteousness of the Soviet Union's enthusiastic assistance to the Chinese people; on the other hand, it also implements the basic spirit of jointly dealing with aggression by Japan or any country colluding with Japan.

　　Someone asked, "Hasn't Japan already been defeated? Why is it still necessary to emphasize preventing Japanese aggression?"

　　We say, yes, the Japanese aggressors have been defeated. In theory, it should no longer have the ability to invade. However, as everyone knows, the Japanese fascist war criminals, led by Emperor Hirohito, laid an ambush in their surrender: preparing to make a comeback in 20 or 30 years. They quickly received the protection of American imperialism and even dared to declare its revenge adventure arrogantly. American imperialism, on the one hand, is trying its best to turn Japan into a strategic base for launching a new war of aggression, delaying the signing of a peace treaty with Japan, and attempting to sign it alone; attempting to occupy Japan for a long time and station a large number of troops in Japan for a long time; on the other hand, it is supporting Japanese reactionary forces and suppressing the strength of the Japanese people, attempting to use the flesh and blood of the Japanese people as cannon fodder for launching a war of aggression. Therefore, we must never think that Japan has been defeated and fail to prevent the resurgence of Japanese aggressive forces, and we must never fail to prepare for the worst just because a third world war can be avoided. Only if we carry out effective prevention work will those war mongers not dare to provoke a new war. China and the Soviet Union are countries with a decisive role in the East. Only when the 700 million people of China and the Soviet Union form an anti-aggression alliance can a third world war be effectively prevented.

　　Someone else asked, "Why is the transfer of the Chinese Changchun Railway, the withdrawal of Soviet troops from Lushunkou, and the handling of the Dalian Port issue stipulated after the signing of a peace treaty with Japan, but no later than the end of 1952, and not earlier or later?"

　　We believe that the leaders of China and the Soviet Union have made these extremely cautious and proper regulations based on the common security interests of the two countries. Before a peace treaty with Japan has not been formally signed based on the principles of the Potsdam Agreement, Japan has not been democratized, it is still a war base for American imperialism, and American imperialism is still continuing to use military supplies, airplanes and bombs to help the Chiang Kai-shek pirates shrinking on Taiwan Island, continuing to massacre the Chinese people, and continuing to bomb Shanghai and other places. Obviously, if the Soviet army withdraws from Lushun and Dalian now and transfers the Chinese Changchun Railway, it would be detrimental to the collective security of China and the Soviet Union and to preventing new imperialist aggression plots. Only after two or three years, that is, no later than the end of 1952, when China's national defense forces are stronger and more capable of taking over the Chinese Changchun Railway and Lushunkou, will we believe that China can assume the responsibility for independently taking over the Chinese Changchun Railway and Lushunkou even if a peace treaty with Japan has not been signed. Therefore, this regulation is an extremely cautious measure.

　　As for Dalian, it is stipulated: "The two contracting parties agree that the issue of Dalian Port must be resolved after the signing of a peace treaty with Japan. As for the administration of Dalian, it shall be completely under the jurisdiction of the Government of the People's Republic of China. All properties in Dalian currently temporarily managed or leased by the Soviet Union shall be taken over by the Government of the People's Republic of China."

　　These agreements and clauses, as Vyshinsky said, "all prove the Soviet Union's respect for the national independence and national interests of the Chinese people, and also prove the greatness of the principles of Soviet foreign policy."

　　关于旅顺口及大连的新协定
　　胡华
　　旅大简史
    旅顺、大连位于中国东北辽东半岛的南部尖端。旅顺口是个优良的海军军港，大连则是个商港。这两个地方曾长期被日本帝国主义所侵占。早在一八九四年的中日“甲午”之战中，大连就曾一度被日寇侵占。到了一八九八年，帝俄又“租借”了旅大，以俄国与中国劳动人民的血汗，在旅顺口建筑了一个海军军港。到了一九○四年日俄帝国主义战争时，俄国失败，旅大又被日本抢占，从此一直被强占了四十一年之久。到一九四五年八月，苏联红军出兵东北，攻入旅大，才把旅大从日寇手中解放出来，成为了中国人民自己的领土。
    一九四五年中苏关于共管旅大协定的意义
    根据一九四五年八月和“中苏友好同盟条约”同时签订的“中苏关于旅顺口之协定”，规定旅顺口在三十年内为由苏联负责防卫、而民事行政仍属于中国、中苏两国共同使用的海军根据地。苏联得在该区驻扎海陆空军。大连呢？根据“中苏关于大连之协定”，为保证苏联对大连为其货物进出口之利益获得保障起见，规定大连为一自由港，并规定在对日存在作战状态期间（即在对日和约尚未签订前），大连也包括在旅顺协定所订之海军根据地章程效用范围之内，受该区域之军事管辖。
    这个协定的意义，和这次签订的新协定的意义基本上是相同的。当时，是为了要在对日作战中战胜日本，及在战后防止日本再事侵略，加强中苏两国的共同安全。它不是租借性质（因民事行政是属于中国的），而是军事合作的性质，就是要中苏两国利用这个优良的海港、坚固的要塞，在对日作战时有效的打击日军，在战后则负起共同监视日本侵略者的责任。
    四年半来的事实证明：这个协定是有重大意义的，对中国人民来说，是十分有利的。由于苏军在东北的主要交通线—中长路、与主要海口—旅顺和大连港上，取得了必需的便利，就很有效的击溃了日本关东军，巩固了东北的胜利。而在战后四年半来，这个辽东半岛尖端的旅顺军港，就像一把刺刀，针对着美帝正在扶植的日本侵略势力，也针对着与日寇勾结的中国人民的死敌—中国反动派与援助中国反动派的国外帝国主义。它使美国帝国主义者与中国反动派不敢侵犯，也就大大的巩固了人民中国的海防。
    就旅大地区本身的建设来说，也是替那里的人民带来了福音，大家请看一个《人民日报》的记者对那里情况的报导吧：
    “现在旅大已没有乞丐、没有妓女、没有小偷、并且基本上消灭了失业现象，到明年年底，两年建设计划完成时，也将基本上消灭文盲。工业建设正在向着超越日寇的最高水平猛进，中长路、玻璃工厂等许多企业已经超越它了。日寇时代不能制造的电气炉、化学工业必需的瓦斯管及好多其他产品，这里已经制造出来并源源生产了。日寇时代没有的工业和工厂，旅大已经建立起来，并继续兴建着。农业生产量，到去年已经达到四五年—日寇统治最后一年生产量的百分之一百七十三。建立起新的大学和中学，小学普遍了每一个偏僻的乡村……。
    四年来，按照中苏友好同盟条约，驻在旅大地区的苏联红军，在其驻军司令部直接领导下对于旅大人民的帮助是无微不至，面面俱到的。……”（《人民日报》记者田流；《苏军在旅大》，载一九四九年十一月二十三日《人民日报》）
    我们再看一些工商界人士参观旅大后所发表的观感吧：
    “胡厥文说：我们曾经在去年亲到东北去考察，我们亲眼看到，就是在苏联有驻军的旅顺、大连，当地的行政也是由中国人自己来管理的。在整个东北地区，绝无苏联人干涉中国内政的现象。……
    俞寰澄说：在大连，我们看到市政建设办得极好，恢复工厂，增加农业生产也很见效。在这方面，苏联朋友的贡献极大。……
    正明会计事务所会计师汪怡说：我们亲眼看见旅大地区完全是在中国旅大行署的统辖之下。那儿没有乞丐，没有失业。我们一致认为旅大是新民主主义建设有成绩的地区。”（《今日的东北》——上海工商界前东北参观团团员在东北目睹的事实，载一九五○年二月六日《人民日报》）
    这类异口同声的赞扬在苏联帮助下旅大的建设与那里人民的幸福的报导，是不胜枚举的。
    关于旅大新协定的意义
    由于人民民主的新中国的建立，消除了国民党反动政府的阻碍，造成了中苏两大国之间的进一步合作的可能，于是，对于具有重大意义的旅顺、大连问题，两国作了从新的处理。
    根据中苏“关于中国长春铁路、旅顺口及大连的协定”第二条规定：“缔约国双方同意一俟对日和约缔结后，但不迟于一九五二年末，苏联军队即自共同使用的旅顺口海军根据地撤退，并将该地区的设备移交中华人民共和国政府而由中华人民共和国政府偿付苏联自一九四五年起对上述设备之恢复与建设的费用。”同时，在这一个条款上也规定：“一旦缔约国任何一方受到日本或其他与日本相勾结的任何国家之侵略因而被卷入军事行动时，经中华人民共和国政府提议及苏联政府同意，中苏两国可共同使用旅顺口海军根据地，以利共同对侵略者作战。”
    这个条款，一方面充分表现了苏联对中国人民热情援助的伟大道义；另一方面，也贯彻了共同对付日本或其他与日本勾结的任何国家的侵略的基本精神。
    有人问：“日本不是已经失败了吗？为什么还要强调防止日本的侵略呢？”
    我们说，是的，日本侵略者是失败了，照理，它不能再有侵略的能力了。但是，大家知道，以裕仁天皇为首的日本法西斯战犯在他们投降时就预伏了一个阴谋：准备二三十年中卷土重来。他们很快的得到了美国帝国主义的庇护，甚至胆敢狂妄地宣布它的复仇冒险。美帝国主义则一方面竭力把日本变成它发动新侵略战争的战略基地，拖延签订对日和约，企图单独签订；企图长期占领日本、长期在日本大量驻兵；另一方面，则一手扶持日本反动势力，压迫日本人民力量，企图以日本人民的血肉作为它发动侵略战争的炮灰。所以，我们决不能以为日本已经失败了而不去防止日本侵略势力的再起，也决不能因为第三次世界大战可以避免，而不作万一的防备。因为只有我们进行切实防止工作，那些战争贩子才不敢挑起新战争。中苏两大国是在东方具有决定作用的国家，只有中苏七万万人民结成反侵略的同盟，才能有效地制止第三次世界大战。
    还有人问：“为什么中长路的移交、苏军从旅顺口的撤退、以及大连港问题的处理，规定在对日和约签订后，但不迟于一九五二年末，而不早些或迟些呢？”
    这个问题，我们相信中苏两国人民领袖根据两国的共同安全的利益，是经过了极慎重的考虑而妥善地规定的。在对日和约还没有根据波茨坦协定原则正式签订前，日本还没有民主化，还是美帝国主义的战争基地，而且美帝国主义今天还在继续用军火，飞机炸弹帮助缩在台湾岛上的蒋介石海盗，继续屠杀中国人民，继续轰炸上海等地，显然的，苏军如果现在就从旅大撤退，移交中长路，这样，对中苏两国的集体安全，对于防止帝国主义新的侵略阴谋，都是不利的。只有待到两三年后，即不迟于一九五二年末，中国人民国防力量更加强大了，也更有能力来掌握中长路和旅顺口了，那时，即使对日和约还未能签订，我们也相信中国自己可以负起单独接管中长路与旅顺口以后的责任。所以，这个规定，是个极其谨慎的措施。
    至于大连，则规定：“缔约国双方同意在对日和约缔结后，必须处理大连港问题。至于大连的行政，则完全直属中华人民共和国政府管辖。现时大连所有财产凡为苏联方面临时代管或苏联方面租用者，应由中华人民共和国政府接收。”
    这些协定与条款，正像维辛斯基所说：“都证明了苏联方面对于中国人民的民族独立与民族权益的尊重，也证明了苏联外交政策原则的伟大。”
