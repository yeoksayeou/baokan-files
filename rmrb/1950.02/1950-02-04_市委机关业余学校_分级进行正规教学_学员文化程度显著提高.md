　　Municipal Party Committee Organ's Spare-Time School
　　Graded Regular Teaching
　　Student Cultural Level Significantly Improved
　　[This newspaper dispatch] The Municipal Party Committee Organ's Spare-Time School, composed of over 120 guards and odd-job personnel from units such as the Organization Department, Propaganda Department, Administrative Office of the Beijing Municipal Party Committee, the Beijing Branch of the Xinhua News Agency, and the Municipal Committee Office, has concluded its first phase, with students making significant progress. When learning began in August of last year, due to the lack of dedicated personnel in charge of teaching, students did not have enough understanding of cultural learning, could not study on time, and there were serious phenomena of laxity. At the end of October, a teachers' meeting was held, and it was decided to reorganize, discuss teaching methods, establish a learning plan, establish a school affairs committee, assign dedicated personnel to teach, distribute textbooks by class, separate morning and evening classes according to spare time, and establish a learning system. Learning gradually got on the right track. After more than two months of learning, considerable achievements have been made. At the beginning of the first grade, most of them were illiterate. Now they have studied more than 20 lessons of the literacy textbook for people's schools, with an average of over 200 characters recognized per person. In mathematics, at the beginning, they couldn't even write the zip code. Now they have finished learning addition and subtraction and are beginning to learn multiplication. In the second grade, the second volume of the people's school textbook has been studied for more than half of the volume. Comrade Wang Fa couldn't even write his own name at the beginning, but now he can write receipts, read letters, and read the Worker's Daily. In mathematics, they have now learned two-digit multiplication; in common sense, they have learned some natural science and general knowledge. In the third grade, the Chinese language adopts the sixth grade textbook of primary school and has taught more than ten lessons. Individual comrades have learned to make sentences and write simple news. Common sense has learned some general knowledge in geography, history, physiology, and hygiene; arithmetic has learned division. In the fourth grade, arithmetic has learned integer four arithmetic problems, parentheses, decimals, and application problems; the Chinese language is the first volume of junior high school, and they also practice composition; nature teaches the first volume of higher primary school; history is taught from ancient times to the Wu Hu uprising of the Jin Dynasty. In the fifth grade, composition has made great progress, and they can produce wall newspapers, and some have even submitted articles to newspapers. The Chinese language is the second volume of junior high school; nature is the third volume of higher primary school; history is taught from ancient times to modern history; arithmetic has progressed from four arithmetic problems in order to the methods of finding distance, area, circumference, and area of a circle. In the school-wide examination, 80% passed, with more than half scoring above 80, and 20% failed. Students who previously had no interest in learning now mostly have a new understanding and have made plans for the next semester to learn from learning models.

　　市委机关业余学校
    分级进行正规教学
    学员文化程度显著提高
    【本报讯】由北京市委组织部、宣传部、行政处，新华社北京分社及市委会办公室等单位警卫队员勤杂人员一百二十余人所组成的市委机关业余学校，第一期已告结束，学员获得显著进步。去年八月学习刚开始时，因没有专人负责教导，学员对文化学习认识不够，不能按时学习，散漫现象很严重。十月底开了教员会，决定重新整顿，讨论了教学方法，订出学习计划，建立校务委员会，指定专人教课，按班次发下课本，按业余时间分开早班晚班，建立了学习制度，学习逐渐步入正轨。经两个多月的学习，已有相当成绩。一年级开始时，大部分都不识字，现在已经学习民校识字课本二十余课，平均每人认识二百多字，数学开始时一般的连字码都不会写，现已学完加减法，开始学乘法。二年级民校课本第二册，现已学完多半本。王发同志开始时连自己的名字都写不好，现在会写收条、看信和工人日报。数学现在学会两位乘法；常识学到一些自然科学和一般的知识。三年级国语采用小学第六册课本，已讲十余课。个别同志学会造句子、写简单的新闻。常识学了一些地理、历史、生理卫生等各方面的普通知识；算术学会除法。四年级算术学了整数四则题，括号，小数及应用问题；国文学的初中一册，还练习作文；自然讲的是高小第一册；历史从远古时代讲到晋朝五胡乱华。五年级作文很进步，能出壁报，有的还投稿在报纸上发表。国文是初中二册；自然是高小第三册；历史从远古时代讲到近代史；算术已由四则题按次序学到距离，面积，圆周及圆面积的求法。全校考试成绩，百分之八十及格，八十分以上者占多半，百分之二十不及格。从前没有学习兴趣的同学，现在大部分有了新的认识，并订出下学期的计划，要向学习模范看齐。      （马瑞华）
