Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 15th -- Li Lisan, Vice Chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, recently made the following statement regarding the signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance, and Mutual Assistance and the other two agreements:
	After reading the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance, and Mutual Assistance and other agreements, our first deep feeling is how profound and great the friendship and care of the Soviet people and their great leader, Marshal Stalin, are for the Chinese people. The Soviet Union was the first country in history to treat us as equals; and in recent decades, whenever the Chinese people were in difficulty and crisis, only the Soviet Union always extended its hand of friendship to help us. When our People's Republic of China was first established, the Soviet Union was the first to establish diplomatic relations with our country. Now, the Soviet Union is the first to sign a treaty of friendship, alliance, and mutual assistance with us, willing to jointly prevent the re-aggression of Japan or other countries that collude with Japan in any form of aggression. This is a great help to the Chinese people in their future struggles to consolidate the fruits of revolutionary victory, defend national independence and territorial integrity, and oppose imperialism's collusion with Japan in any form to infringe upon China. This is a great blow to the US imperialists and their running dogs who attempt to carry out aggression by force and provoke war. This is a great contribution to the cause of lasting peace in the Far East and even the whole world.
	The other two agreements also stipulate that after the conclusion of the peace treaty with Japan, the Soviet Union will withdraw its troops stationed in Lushun and transfer all rights and all property of the Sino-Soviet jointly managed Chinese Changchun Railway to the government of the People's Republic of China free of charge; and in view of the severe damage suffered by China due to long-term military operations, they will provide us with long-term loans at low interest rates; in addition, in the exchange of letters between the foreign ministers of the two countries, the Soviet government also stated that it would transfer the property acquired by the Soviet economic organs in Northeast China from Japan to us free of charge. This is even more powerful assistance to our future recovery of production and development of the economy. Such sincere friendly assistance can only be given by socialist countries, and only by countries guided by the Leninist-Stalinist internationalist policy. Chairman Mao Zedong told us that we belong to the anti-imperialist camp headed by the Soviet Union in the international arena, and true friendly assistance can only be found in this direction. The signing of this Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance, and Mutual Assistance is the best proof.
	The Chinese working class supports this treaty with infinite excitement and celebrates this treaty; and encouraged by the great friendship and assistance of the Soviet Union, we must make greater efforts to overcome the current difficulties, restore and develop production, and strive to build a prosperous and happy new China to the end!
	Long live the friendship and eternal cooperation between China and the Soviet Union!
	Long live Chairman Mao, the leader of the Chinese working class and all the people!
	Long live Marshal Stalin, the great leader of the working people of the world!

　　全国总工会李立三副主席谈称
    苏联伟大友谊援助工人阶级无限兴奋
    全国各界兴奋鼓舞  拥护中苏兄弟同盟
    【新华社北京十五日电】中华全国总工会李立三副主席顷就中苏签订友好同盟互助条约及其他两个协定发表谈话如下：
    我们读了中苏友好同盟互助条约及其他各种协定之后，首先深深感觉到的是：苏联人民及其伟大领袖斯大林大元帅对我们中国人民的友谊与关怀是如何的深切伟大。历史上第一个以平等待我的国家就是苏联；而最近几十年来每当中国人民陷于困难危急的时候，只有苏联总是伸出他的友谊之手来援助我们。当我们中华人民共和国刚一建立，苏联就首先和我国建立外交关系。现在，苏联又首先与我们订立友好同盟互助条约，愿意与我们来共同防止日本或其他用任何形式在侵略行为上与日本相勾结的国家之重新侵略。这是对于中国人民今后为巩固革命胜利成果、保卫国家独立与领土完整、反对帝国主义以任何形式与日本勾结侵犯中国所进行的斗争之莫大援助。这是对于美帝国主义及其走狗们企图以武力进行侵略和挑起战争的阴谋之莫大的打击。这是对于远东以至全世界持久和平事业的莫大贡献。
    其他两个协定又规定：俟对日和约缔结后，苏联即撤退旅顺驻军，并将中苏两国共管的中长铁路的一切权利及其全部财产无偿地移交中华人民共和国政府；又鉴于中国因长期军事行动，遭受非常破坏给我们以低利的长期借款；此外，在两国外长换文中，苏联政府又表示将苏联经济机关在东北自日本手中所获得的财产无偿地移交给我们。这更是对我们今后恢复生产、发展经济的极有力的援助。这种忠诚的友好援助，只有社会主义国家，只有列宁、斯大林国际主义政策指导的国家，才能给与我们的。毛泽东主席告诉我们说：我们在国际上，是属于以苏联为首的反帝国主义阵营一方面的，真正的友谊的援助，只能向这一方面去找。这次中苏友好同盟互助条约的签订，便是最好的证明。
    中国工人阶级以无限的兴奋来拥护这个条约，来庆祝这个条约；并在苏联这种伟大友谊援助的鼓舞下，要以更大的努力来克服当前困难，恢复和发展生产，为建设富强幸福的新中国而奋斗到底！
    中苏两国友好和永远合作万岁！
    中国工人阶级和全体人民的领袖毛主席万岁！
    全世界劳动人民的伟大领袖斯大林大元帅万岁！
