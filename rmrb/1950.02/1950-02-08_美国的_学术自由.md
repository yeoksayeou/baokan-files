	Progressive professors are often persecuted in the fascist United States. Dr. Spitzer, a chemistry professor at Oregon State University, was fired for supporting Soviet Professor Lysenko's genetics. The university's reactionary president also criticized Dr. Spitzer as having "no scientific discernment, no pursuit of truth, because he was bound by Soviet doctrines."
	Marshall Gallaher, Associate Professor of History and "Soviet Government Studies" at Yale University, was also forced to resign. His crime was "teaching pro-Soviet" and that he had proposed inviting the famous Soviet composer Shostakovich to perform at Yale. In addition, Frederick Seitz, a physics professor at the University of North Carolina who received a grant from the US Atomic Energy Commission, was deemed "suspected of being pro-communist" and lost not only his scholarship but also his teaching position. According to the American Association of University Professors, more than 200 university professors in the United States have been suspended, dismissed, and never re-hired under similar charges by the summer of 1949.

　　美国的“学术自由”
    思想进步的教授，在法西斯化的美国经常受到迫害。俄勒岗州州立大学化学教授史培泽博士，因为拥护苏联李森科教授的遗传学，就被开除了。该大学反动校长并批评史培泽博士为“无科学辨别力，无真理探求力，因为他被苏联的学说束缚了”。
    耶鲁大学历史学及“苏联政府学”副教授马沙尔加也被迫辞职，他的罪名是“教学亲苏”，而且他曾经提议邀请苏联著名作曲家萧斯塔科维奇到耶鲁演奏。此外，得美国原子能管制委员会奖金的北加罗那州大学物理学教授佛莱斯德特被认为“有亲共嫌疑”，不但丢了奖学金，也丢了教职。在类似的罪名下，美国被停聘、解聘、并永不再被聘用的大学教授们，据美国大学教授联合会的统计，至一九四九年夏天，已达二百人以上。
