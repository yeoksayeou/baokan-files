　　The Workers' Movement in Beijing Over the Past Year
    Beijing Municipal Federation of Trade Unions

    Under the direct leadership of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions and the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, the workers' movement in Beijing has achieved considerable success in the past year.

    (1) In terms of restoring and developing production, at the beginning of Beijing's liberation, workers in various factories earnestly assisted in the takeover. Workers at the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant discovered more than double the listed amount of unaccounted-for materials during the takeover and inventory process in one branch factory. Workers at the Changxindian Machinery Plant, the Pinghan Railway Administration, and other factories launched campaigns to donate materials. Not only that, but workers in various factories have also thrown themselves into the upsurge of restoring and developing production with a new labor attitude. Recently, workers at the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant, with the help of Soviet experts, set a new production record, producing 331 tons of iron per day, breaking the all-time high and the old quota.

    (2) In terms of trade union organization, in the past year, 83 formal trade unions and 125 preparatory committees have been established in the city. The development of membership is listed below:

       Industry  Handicraft  Shop     Transportation Educational/Medical  Government  Total
       Workers   Workers     Employees Workers    Workers           Workers
                                                         Workers
    Total Employees 97643  2318   109708  35498  25438  80000  390605
    Members   76530  32467  21343   32160  22378  1280   186158
    Percentage  78.3%  76.7%  19.5%   90.6%  89.5%  0.16%  47.6%

    In the process of developing membership and organizing trade unions, we have trained and promoted a large number of trade union cadres. Among them, a total of 19,007 cadres above the level of trade union group leaders have been trained and promoted, and a total of 980 cadres have been promoted from workers to government organs and to participate in factory management. In addition, 3,805 workers were mobilized to join the Beijing Municipal Public Security Team.

    (3) In terms of labor insurance and welfare, the trade union vigorously organized employee cooperatives. As of September last year, the development of cooperatives in public and private factories and various industries is shown in the following table:

           Number of Cooperatives Number of Members Number of Cadres Capital (Millet)
    Public and Private Factories 57   210,075  788  743,645 jin
    Transportation Workers 46   60,975  225  271,075 jin
    Total   103  271,050  1,013  1,014,720 jin

    Employees participating in the cooperative enjoyed purchase benefits that were 12% to 38% lower than the market price. In addition, the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, in conjunction with the Bureau of Culture and Education, solved the enrollment problems of 5,582 children of workers who were out of school.

    (4) In terms of propaganda and education, the biggest gain in worker education last year was the universal implementation of political enlightenment education, combined with the current political thought and production tasks of the workers, which improved the workers' class consciousness. According to a recent survey, most of the 186,158 people organized in the city have received preliminary political and current affairs education. Among them, 80,421, or 43.2% of those organized, participated in worker night schools or study classes. In addition, the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions has also held three terms of employee training classes, with a total of 1,100 trainees. In terms of propaganda work, each factory and industry trade union has published tabloids. The following table shows the statistics of worker tabloids, wall newspapers, correspondence, broadcasts, and blackboards in 25 factories and 12 districts:

         Tabloids (Every 3,5 days,  Wall Newspapers Correspondence Groups Broadcasting Groups Blackboard
         Weekly)        (Every 3 days Weekly) Units Types
         Letterpress Litho Participation Issues Types Participation Groups Participation Submissions Groups Participation Broadcasts Newspapers
         Printing Printing Number Number  Types Number  Number Number Paid Out  Number Number Times 
    25 Factories 9  7   600  8000  35  376  80 900  3688 13 200  90   80
    17 Districts      28  188  21 300  291  2  43   12
    Total  16   600  8000  63  564  101 1200 3979 15 243 102   80

    In terms of cultural entertainment, we have held two amateur art training classes and two joint performances. The second joint performance lasted for six days, with more than 1,000 workers participating. Among the 66 programs in the entire performance, 10 scripts and songs were created by the workers themselves.

    In addition to the above achievements, the Beijing workers' movement over the past year has also launched a democratic management movement in state-owned factories. Eight units have now established factory management committees. In private factories and industries, five industries have signed collective labor-capital contracts, and six industries, including knitting, oil, salt, and grain, are in the process of negotiation.

    The experience of trade union work over the past year has proven that in state-owned enterprises, to rely on workers and develop production, it is necessary to implement the democratization of factory management. First of all, there must be full ideological preparation. Cadres must unanimously recognize in their minds that the purpose of democratization of factory management is to combine leadership with the masses and rely on workers to improve production. At the same time, it is necessary to clarify that one or two major issues related to production, or other issues that urgently need to be resolved, should be resolved through representative meetings. Before the meeting, these issues should be widely deliberated and studied among the masses, and then the opinions of the masses should be concentrated and submitted to the conference for discussion. After the representative meeting, in addition to organizing representatives to convey the spirit of the meeting to the masses in a planned manner, a management committee should be established as soon as possible so that democratic management can be implemented through a certain organizational form to solve major problems in production. Second, it is necessary to let go and mobilize the masses. In the past, in the democratic management movement, some cadres did not trust the masses, believing that the masses were backward and that launching the movement would lead to excessive economic demands. This idea seriously hindered the development of the democratic management movement, so it is necessary to pay attention to correcting it at any time before and during the development of the movement. Facts have proven that as long as we fully mobilize the masses and conduct in-depth policy education and class education, as long as the workers are awakened, most of the suggestions they put forward are correct and reasonable. At the employee representative meeting of the Tram Company in July last year, a total of 342 proposals were put forward, of which 257 were constructive opinions, accounting for 75% of all proposals, which is a very good example. Third, the only purpose of the democratization movement is to develop production, so it must be closely centered on the production movement. If the democratic movement is carried out away from production, it will create a purely critical leadership and one-sided demand for worker welfare, which will promote the tendency of extreme democratization among employees. In fact, in all factories that have truly mobilized the masses and truly implemented democratic management, all aspects of work have shown a vigorous new atmosphere. After the People's Printing Plant held an employee representative meeting, the production volume of units such as the intaglio printing section and the offset printing section increased by an average of 28.5%, with the highest being the web-fed offset press exceeding 83% within half a month in September. The Tram Company completed the second 100-vehicle movement one week ahead of schedule and implemented a conductor responsibility system. This all proves that only by implementing democratic management can people-run enterprises be run well.

    Experience has also proven that signing contracts by industry is the best way to resolve labor-capital disputes and develop production in private industries. In the early days of liberation, labor-capital disputes in private industries were not handled in a centralized and unified manner, so disputes arose one after another. In May last year, according to the instructions of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions and the Municipal Committee, collective contracts were signed by industry to resolve labor-capital disputes. There are two benefits: First, to change the past feudal and semi-feudal labor-capital contractual relationship into a truly equal and voluntary labor-capital relationship; second, to organize workers in an entire industry through the signing of collective contracts, to educate workers with collective contracts, and to clarify their class concepts. In the past, three experiences have been gained in signing collective contracts: First, there should be a full investigation and deliberation stage before signing the contract to understand the general situation of the industry, so as to discover the crux of labor-capital problems in the industry and determine our work policy for the industry. If a comprehensive contract is signed, and labor and capital have disputes that cannot be resolved for a while, a temporary agreement can be signed and implemented for problems that can be resolved and urgently need to be resolved. Although the temporary agreements signed by the construction industry and the bathhouse industry in the past were only three or four articles, they were able to solve some practical problems that urgently needed to be solved in each industry. In addition, the effective time of the contract should be shorter, and should not exceed half a year at most, so that it can be made more complete and easier to implement as the situation changes. Second, because the size and quality of each business in the same industry may be different, flexibility should be given to each business when stipulating wages and workers' living conditions. After the collective contract is signed, each business should be immediately promoted to formulate a more specific small contract or implementation method under the principles of the large contract. Generally speaking, the articles of the small contract or the implementation contract do not need to be too many, but only to stipulate certain items that are not clear enough under the large contract according to the specific circumstances of each business. Some shop labor and capital parties believe that it is appropriate to implement the large contract, then it is not necessary to sign a small contract or implementation method. Third, after signing the contract, it is necessary to strengthen production education and launch a production and conservation movement.

    Experience has proven that convening representative meetings and establishing trade unions from top to bottom must be combined with mobilizing the masses and consolidating trade union organizations from bottom to top, and taking centralized and unified measures to organize workers and resolve labor-capital disputes. The specific method is to convene a city-wide temporary representative assembly of the industry by industry and establish a city-wide trade union preparatory committee. After the preparatory committee is established, it should assist the employees of each business in establishing grassroots trade union organizations. In the process of organizing the trade union, discover and cultivate activists. Once activists are discovered, they should be grasped and educated, and more activists should be discovered and cultivated through them. Then, with the activists as the backbone, expand and consolidate the trade union organization. After the grassroots trade union organization is established, a membership registration should be carried out as much as possible, and the members should be preliminarily reviewed to lay the foundation for the formal trade union in the future. When the grassroots trade union organization is quite sound, general elections of representatives should be carried out to prepare for the establishment of a formal trade union. After the city-wide trade union preparatory committee is established, it is necessary to focus on the education and leadership of the cadres of the preparatory committee. In addition, in the work process, it is necessary to be good at combining organizational work, educational work, and drafting collective contracts in order to improve workers' awareness and consolidate the organization.

    Although the Beijing trade union work has achieved the above-mentioned achievements and experience in the past year, many shortcomings have also occurred. The most important shortcoming is that the leadership method is not good at using the working method of "breaking through one point, absorbing experience, and promoting the overall situation." On the one hand, in the entire trade union work, in every major movement, we did not first engage in one or two key factories or important industries, absorb experience, and promote the development of the entire movement. For example, in the democratic management movement in factories, we initially proposed the wrong working method of "advancing side by side, starting together, and completing within a time limit," but lacked inspection work and specific assistance, so that the movement did not achieve the expected results. On the other hand, some experience has been created in some work, but this experience has not been summarized and promoted in a timely manner. Therefore, although the trade union work in the past year has explored some experience, it lacks a more complete series of experience related to trade union work.

    According to the above summary and the instructions of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions and the Municipal Committee, the central task of trade union work at present is to restore and develop production. Starting with signing collective contracts in state-owned enterprises and continuing in private enterprises, promoting the high enthusiasm of employees, discussing production plans proposed by factories and capitalists in accordance with the contracts, leading workers to ensure the completion of production plans, and striving to exceed them. In terms of organizational work, strive to basically organize shop assistants and government staff throughout the city within six months, and enrich trade union life in the established trade unions, especially industrial trade unions. In terms of cultural and educational work, political education should still be the main focus for workers who have not received political education, and those who have received preliminary political education can be mobilized to participate in regular worker spare-time schools with cultural courses as the main focus. Regarding labor insurance and welfare, necessary and possible problems should be solved on the basis of the current restoration and development of production.

　　北京市一年来的工人运动
    北京市总工会
    北京市一年来的工人运动，在中华全国总工会、中国共产党北京市委员会直接的领导下，获得了不小成绩。
    （一）就恢复与发展生产来说，北京解放之初，各厂职工认真协助接管，石景山钢铁厂工人在协助接管清点中，一个分厂查出的账外物品种类超过一倍。长辛店机厂、平汉铁路管理局等厂工人，则发起了献交器材运动。不仅如此，各厂职工更以新的劳动姿态，投入恢复与发展生产的热潮中。最近石景山钢铁厂的工人在苏联专家的帮助下，创造了新的生产纪录，每天产铁三百三十一吨，打破了历来的最高纪录和旧定额。
    （二）就工会组织工作来说，一年来全市共成立正式工会八十三个，筹备会一百二十五个，其会员发展列表如下：
       产业  手工业工人 店员工人  搬运工人 教育医务 机关工 总计
       工人                                工作者   作者
    职工总数  97643  2318   109708  35498  25438  80000  390605
    会员数    76530  32467  21343   32160  22378  1280   186158
    百分比    78.3%  76.7%  19.5%   90.6%  89.5%  0.16%  47.6%
    在发展会员组织工会过程中，我们大批培养和提拔了工会干部，其中培养和提拔工会小组长以上的干部共一万九千零七人，从工人中提拔到政权机关和参加工厂管理等干部共计九百八十人，此外还动员了三千八百零五名工人参加京市公安队。
    （三）就劳保福利说，工会大力组织职工合作社，到去年九月为止，公私营工厂与各行业合作社发展如下表：
           合作社数字 社员数           干部数       股金数（小米）公私营工厂 五十七个   二一○、○七五人 七八八人     七四三、六四五斤搬运工人   四十六个   六○、九七五人   二二五人     二七一、○七五斤总计       一百○三个 二七一、○五○人 一、○一三人 一、○一四、七二○斤
    凡参加合作社的职工，均享受了低于市价百分之十二至百分之三十八的购货待遇。此外市总工会协同文教局解决了工人失学子弟五千五百八十二人的入学问题。
    （四）就宣传教育工作来说，去年工人教育最大的收获，是结合着当前的工人政治思想与生产任务，普遍地进行了政治的启蒙教育，提高了工人的阶级觉悟。据最近的调查，全市已经组织起来的十八万六千一百五十八人中，大部进行了初步的政治教育和时事教育，其中有八万零四百二十一人，即占已组织起来者百分之四十三点二的工人，参加了工人夜校或学习班。此外，市职工总会还开办了三期职工训练班，受训者共达一千一百人。宣传工作方面，各工厂各行业工会中，均出版了小报，现将二十五个工厂十二个区的工人小报、壁报、通讯、广播、黑板报列表统计如下：
         小报（三日，         壁报     通讯小组       广播小组
         五日，周刊）     （三日周刊）单位     种 类
         铅 油  参加 发行  种  参加    组 参加 稿件 组 参加 广播 黑板

    文化娱乐方面，我们举办过两期业余文艺训练班，二次联合演出，第二次联合演出历时六天，参加演出的工人一千多人。在整个演出的六十六个节目中，有十个剧本和歌子是工人自己的创作。
    一年来的北京工人运动除了上述成绩外，在公营工厂中还开展了工厂管理民主化运动，现有八个单位成立了工厂管理委员会。在私营工厂与行业中，签订劳资集体合同的有五个行业，正在进行协商者有针织、油盐粮等六行业。
    一年来的工会工作经验证明：在公营企业中，要依靠工人，发展生产，便必须实行工厂管理民主化。首先要有充分的思想准备，干部必须在思想上一致认识到工厂管理民主化的目的，是使领导与群众相结合，依靠工人搞好生产。同时要明确通过代表会，解决一二有关生产的重大问题，或其他极需解决的问题。会前即将这些问题在群众中进行广泛的酝酿和研究，然后集中群众意见，提交大会讨论。在代表大会后，除有计划地组织代表向群众传达外，应迅速成立管委会，使管理民主化得以通过一定组织形式，贯彻执行，以解决生产中的重大问题。第二，要放手发动群众。过去管理民主化运动中，有些干部不信任群众，认为群众落后，一经发动就会提出过高的经济要求，这种思想曾严重地妨碍了工厂管理民主化运动的开展，所以必须在运动之前以及运动发展过程中，随时注意纠正。事实证明，只要我们充分发动了群众，并作了深刻的政策教育和阶级教育，只要工人觉悟起来，其所提建议，绝大部分是正确的合理的。去年七月电车公司的职工代表大会上，共提出了三百四十二件提案，其中建设性的意见有二百五十七件，占全部提案的百分之七十五，便是很好的例证。第三，民主化运动的唯一目的就是发展生产，所以必须紧密地围绕着生产运动进行。如果离开生产去搞民主化运动，就会造成单纯的批评领导与片面的要求工人福利的观点，助长职工中极端民主化的思想倾向。事实上凡是真正发动了群众，真正实行了管理民主化的工厂，各方面工作都表现了蓬蓬勃勃的新气象。人民印制厂开过职工代表会后，凹印股、平版股等单位，生产数量平均超过百分之二十八点五，其中最高的胶印半截机九月份半月之内超过百分之八十三。电车公司二次百辆车运动提前一周完成，并实行了乘务负责制。这都证明了只有实行民主管理，才能办好人民企业。
    经验又证明：在私营行业中按行按业签订合同，是解决劳资争议发展生产的最好途径。在解放初期，私营行业中劳资争议没有集中统一地处理，因此，纠纷此伏彼起。去年五月，根据全总、市委指示，按行按业订立集体合同，解决劳资争议。其好处有二：一是将过去封建的半封建的劳资契约关系，改变为真正平等的自愿的劳资关系；二是通过订立集体合同，将一行一业的工人组织起来，用集体合同教育工人，明确其阶级观念。以往签订集体合同中，取得了三点经验：第一，签订合同前要经过充分调查酝酿阶段，了解该行业一般情况，以便发现该行业劳资问题的症结。决定我们对该行业工作的方针。如签订一个全面的合同，劳资双方有争议而一时不能解决时，可将能够解决而急需解决的问题，先订一个临时协议执行。过去建筑业、浴堂业所订的临时协议虽只三，四条，但却能够解决各该行业中迫切需要解决的一些实际问题。此外，合同有效时间以较短为宜，最长不要超过半年，这样可以随情况的变化订的更为完善，便于执行。第二、因为同一行业各家营业大小好坏可能不同，因此在规定工资和工人生活待遇等问题时，应留给各家以伸缩的余地，在集体合同签订之后，应即时推动各家在大合同的原则下，订一个更具体的小合同或执行办法。一般的说，小合同或执行合同条文不必太多，只是根据各家具体情况，对某几项照大合同办理还不够明确的问题加以规定。有的铺家劳资双方认为执行大合同合适，那么就不必一定订小合同或执行办法。第三、签订合同后，要加强生产教育，开展生产节约运动。
    经验证明：自上而下召开代表会、成立工会，必须和自下而上发动群众、巩固工会组织相结合，采取集中的统一的办法去组织工人和解决劳资争议。其具体方法就是按行按业召开该行业全市性临时代表大会，成立全市性工会筹备会。筹备会成立后应协助各家职工建立工会基层组织。在组织工会过程中，发现与培养积极分子，积极分子一经发现，便应抓紧教育，并通过他们来发现与培养更多的积极分子，然后，以积极分子为骨干，扩大与巩固工会组织。工会基层组织建立后，应尽可能的进行一次会员登记，初步审查会员，为将来正式工会打下基础，当工会基层组织已相当健全时，再进行普选代表，准备成立正式工会。全市性的工会筹备会成立以后，要抓紧对筹委会干部的教育和领导。此外，在工作过程中，要善于把组织工作、教育工作和拟订集体合同结合起来，以便提高工人觉悟，巩固组织。
    一年来北京市工会工作虽然得到了上述的成绩和经验，但也发生了不少的缺点。其中最主要的一个缺点是领导方法上不善于运用“突破一点，吸取经验，推动全盘”的工作方法。一方面在整个工会工作中，在每一个重大的运动中，我们没有先搞一两个重点工厂或重要行业，吸取经验，去推动整个运动的开展。如工厂管理民主化运动，一开始我们就提出了“齐头并进，一起下手，限期完成”的错误的工作方法，但却缺乏检查工作与具体的帮助，致使这一运动没有得到预期的效果。另一方面，有些工作中也曾经创造了些经验，但并没有将这些经验及时总结推广。所以一年来的工会工作虽然摸索了一些经验，但缺乏有关工会工作的较完整的系列的经验。
    根据以上的总结和全总与市委的指示，当前工会工作中心任务是恢复与发展生产。开始在公营企业中和继续在私营企业中订立集体合同，发扬员工的高度积极性，按照合同，认真讨论工厂和资方所提出的生产计划，领导工人保证生产计划的完成，并努力争取超过之。在组织工作方面，争取在半年之内，把全市店员和机关工作人员基本上组织起来，在已建立起来的工会特别是产业工会中，要充实工会生活。在文化教育工作方面，对没有进行过政治教育的工人，仍以政治教育为主，已经受过初步政治教育者，可动员其参加以文化课为主的正规的工人业余学校。关于劳保福利，则应在目前恢复与发展生产的基础上去解决必要的和可能的问题。
