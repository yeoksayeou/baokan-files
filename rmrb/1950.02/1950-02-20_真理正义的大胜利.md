　　Great Victory of Truth and Justice
    Shao Lizi
    Since the announcement of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance and the two agreements on the Chinese Changchun Railway, Lushunkou, Dalian, and loans to our country, all Chinese people have been jubilant and warmly celebrating. The content of this treaty and the two agreements fully conforms to the common interests and aspirations of the Chinese and Soviet people. However, in the history of world diplomacy, especially in the history of Chinese diplomacy, it is impossible to find a treaty and agreement with such lofty and great internationalist ideals. Therefore, in the eyes of the shortsighted, it is inevitable that such a treaty and agreement is too beneficial to China, and the Soviet Union did not pursue any interests at all, which seems a bit unbelievable. Even I, who have always stood on the position of Sino-Soviet friendship and praised the Soviet Union as the most benevolent among the benevolent, before seeing the full text of the treaty and agreement, although I had long expected that Chairman Mao and Premier Zhou's visit to the Soviet Union would definitely have great achievements, and I was also convinced that Marshal Stalin, based on his consistent spirit of assisting the Chinese people, would give the People's Republic of China greater assistance, but I really did not dare to expect that this achievement and assistance could reach such a historically unprecedented highest development. Upon careful reflection, these two world giants, Marshal Stalin and Chairman Mao Zedong, created this major event with world historical significance and broke the world historical record, but they only see it as something that should inevitably exist in the evolution of human history. In their lofty and great internationalist ideals, they only see it as the fulfillment of the tasks entrusted to them by the times.
    We should recall Chairman Mao's speech at the station upon his arrival in Moscow. Chairman Mao said at that time: "The important tasks at present are to consolidate the world peace front headed by the Soviet Union, oppose war instigators, consolidate the friendly relations between China and the Soviet Union, and develop the friendship between the Chinese and Soviet people. I believe that due to the victory of the Chinese people's revolution and the establishment of the People's Republic of China, due to the joint efforts of the new democratic countries and peace-loving people of the world, due to the common aspirations and close cooperation between China and the Soviet Union, especially due to Marshal Stalin's correct international policy, these tasks will surely be fully realized and achieve good results." Chairman Mao had a firm belief that he would be able to fully realize the important tasks he identified at present, and the realization of these tasks would inevitably bring good results to the cause of human peace and justice in the East and the world. Why did Chairman Mao have such firm conviction? Because he was convinced that Marshal Stalin and the Soviet people are practitioners of truth and justice, and that he himself and the Chinese people he leads are also doing so.
    Soviet Foreign Minister Vyshinsky, in his speech at the signing ceremony, solemnly quoted Marshal Stalin's words about the Chinese revolution as early as 1925: "Truth and justice are entirely on the side of the Chinese revolution. That is why we sympathize with the Chinese revolution now and in the future, sympathize with the Chinese people's struggle to liberate themselves from the shackles of imperialism and to unite China into a whole country." Marshal Stalin was certain that the Chinese revolution would be victorious; he has many famous sayings about the Chinese revolution. Foreign Minister Vyshinsky only quoted the above sentences at the signing ceremony because this is most sufficient to explain the Soviet people's deep belief in the Chinese revolution. Today, the Chinese revolution has won victory, the Chinese people have been liberated from the shackles of imperialism, and the entire China has become a unified country. The main reason is that truth and justice are on the side of the Chinese revolution, and the Soviet Union has always sympathized with the Chinese revolution and assisted the Chinese revolution only for the sake of truth and justice. Truth and justice will always be victorious; the signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance and related agreements is also a great victory of truth and justice.
    The power of truth and justice is immeasurable and cannot be seen by shortsighted politicians and diplomats. They always think that diplomacy is only about trickery, relying on force, and pursuing their own selfish interests. They sometimes also use the terms of truth and justice as a deceptive cover, but in reality, they are completely contrary to truth and justice. They will never believe that only truth and justice are the truly victorious elements. Therefore, when they see the new Sino-Soviet treaty and agreement, they feel that the Soviet Union has not pursued its own selfish interests at all, which is unbelievable. As for the warmongers who use malice to speculate, after seeing the new Sino-Soviet treaty and agreement, they still want to spread rumors and provoke the two major nations of China and the Soviet Union and the peace-loving people of the world. That is truly willing to be enemies with truth and justice, just as Marshal Stalin said about the Chinese revolution: "The rulers of the East and the West who do not see these forces and do not give these forces the due estimate will pay the price for it." Are the American imperialists not paying their price today, getting into a mess?
    Sun Yat-sen praised Lenin as a revolutionary saint and advocated that the Chinese revolution must take Russia as its teacher. He saw clearly that truth and justice were on the side of the Soviet Union. In his will to the Soviet Union written at his death, Sun Yat-sen said: "I hope that dawn will soon break, when the Soviet Union will welcome a strong and independent China as a good friend and ally. The two countries will join hands in the great war to win freedom for the oppressed nations of the world and achieve victory." Judging from the new Sino-Soviet treaty, Sun Yat-sen's hope has been fully realized. Sun Yat-sen once analyzed in detail the future situation of the world, which will be a duel between the two sides of public reason and power, and victory will be on the side of public reason. We see that Chiang Kai-shek and his reactionary group who betrayed Sun Yat-sen are trapped in the fate of destruction, while Chairman Mao Zedong, who understands Sun Yat-sen's forty years of experience, is leading the entire Chinese people, joining hands with our good friends and allies, and moving towards a greater victory road. We must believe even more and shout: "Justice is with us, victory must be ours!"
    While we are jubilant and celebrating, we must strive to consolidate the victories we have achieved and strive to win greater victories. We must be united throughout the country and fully realize the important tasks Chairman Mao said at present: "Consolidate the world peace front headed by the Soviet Union, oppose war instigators, consolidate the friendly relations between China and the Soviet Union, and develop the friendship between the Chinese and Soviet people"!
    Long live the Sino-Soviet friendship based on truth and justice!
    Long live Marshal Stalin and Chairman Mao Zedong, practitioners of truth and justice!

　　真理正义的大胜利
    邵力子
    自从中苏间签订友好同盟互助条约并签订关于中长铁路旅顺口大连及贷款我国两个协定的消息公布以后，全中国人民都欢欣鼓舞，热烈庆祝。这一条约和两个协定的内容，完全符合于中苏两国人民共同的利益和愿望；但在世界外交史上，尤其是在中国外交史上，还找不出有这样崇高伟大的国际主义理想的条约和协定。因此，在浅见者看来，难免觉得这样的条约和协定，对于中国太有利，而苏联竟毫未追求什么利益，似乎有点使人难以相信。就是我，一向站在中苏友好的立场，称颂苏联是仁者中的至仁，在没有看到条约和协定的全文以前，虽然早料到毛主席周总理赴苏商谈一定会有巨大的成就，也早确信斯大林大元帅本着一向援助中国人民的精神，一定会给予中华人民共和国以更大的援助，但实在没有敢于预期这次的成就和援助能达到像这样在历史上从未有过的最高发展。仔细想起来，在斯大林大元帅和毛泽东主席这两位世界巨人，创造了这一件有世界历史意义并打破世界历史纪录的大事，也只看做这是人类历史演进中必然应有的事，而在他们崇高伟大的国际主义的理想中，更只看做这是执行了时代所赋予他们的任务。
    我们应当回想毛主席抵达莫斯科时在车站上的演说词。毛主席那时说：“目前的重要任务，是巩固以苏联为首的世界和平阵线，反对战争挑拨者，巩固中苏两大国家的邦交，和发展中苏人民的友谊。我相信，由于中国人民革命的胜利，和中华人民共和国的成立，由于新民主国家及世界爱好和平人民的共同努力，由于中苏两大国的共同愿望和亲密合作，特别是由于斯大林大元帅的正确的国际政策，这些任务必将会充分实现并获得良好的结果”。毛主席早有确定的信念，相信他必能充分实现他所认定的目前重要任务，而这些任务的实现，必然会使东方与世界的人类和平正义的事业都获得良好的结果。毛主席何以会有这样的坚定信念，是因为他确信斯大林大元帅和苏联人民是真理和正义的实践者，而他自己和他所领导的中国人民也正是如此。
    苏联外交部长维辛斯基先生在签字式上的演说，曾郑重引用斯大林大元帅远在一九二五年所说关于中国革命的话：“真理和正义，完全是在中国革命的一方面。这就是为什么我们在现在和将来都同情中国的革命，同情中国人民自帝国主义枷锁之下争取解放的斗争和将中国团结成为一个整个的国家。”斯大林大元帅是确信中国革命会得到胜利的；他有很多关于中国革命的名言。维辛斯基外长在签字式上只引述上面的几句，是因为这最足以说明苏联人民对于中国革命的深刻信念，今天中国革命已获得胜利，中国人民已自帝国主义枷锁之下解放出来，整个中国已成为一个统一国家，主要的原因是真理和正义在中国革命的方面，而苏联也只是为了真理和正义，始终同情中国革命，援助中国革命。真理和正义将是永远胜利；中苏友好同盟互助条约和有关协定的签订，也正是真理和正义的大胜利。
    真理和正义的力量是不可计量的，不是浅见的政治家和外交家所能看到的。他们总以为办外交只是讲诈术，凭武力，追求自己的私利。他们有时也运用真理和正义的名词来做骗人的幌子，实际上他们是完全与真理正义相背驰，他们决不会相信只有真理和正义是真正胜利的要素。所以他们看到中苏新条约和协定，觉得苏联毫未追求自己的私利，是使人难以相信的。至于战争贩子们用恶意来推测，看了中苏新条约和协定以后，还想造谣挑拨中苏两大民族和世界爱好和平的人民，那真是甘心与真理正义为仇，正如斯大林大元帅论中国革命所说：“看不见这些力量，并且不给这些力量以应有的估计的东方和西方的统治者们，将要为此付出他们的代价。”今天美帝国主义者不是正在付出他们的代价，弄得狼狈万状吗？
    孙中山先生称颂列宁是革命的圣人，主张中国革命必须以俄为师，是早看清楚真理正义是在苏联一方面的。孙先生在他临终时写给苏联的遗书上说：“希望不久即将破晓，斯时苏联以良友及盟国来欢迎强盛独立之中国，两国在争取世界被压迫民族自由之大战中，携手并进，以取得胜利。”从中苏新条约来看，孙先生的希望已完全实现了。孙先生曾详细分析世界未来的形势，将是公理与强权两方面的决斗，而胜利是在公理的一方面。我们看到那背叛孙中山先生的蒋介石及其反动集团自陷于覆灭的命运，而理解孙中山先生四十年经验的毛泽东主席，正领导着全中国人民，与我们的良友及盟国携手并进，走向更大的胜利道路，我们更要相信，并高呼：“正义在我们，胜利一定是我们的！”
    我们在欢欣鼓舞热烈庆祝之际，要努力巩固已得的胜利，要努力争取更大的胜利。我们要全国一致，完全实现毛主席所说目前的重要任务：“巩固以苏联为首的世界和平阵线，反对战争挑拨者，巩固中苏两大国家的邦交和发展中苏人民的友谊”！
    以真理正义为基础的中苏友谊万岁！
    真理正义的实践者斯大林大元帅和毛泽东主席万岁！
