　　[Beijing News] On the eve of the "February 7th" anniversary, more than 400 worker representatives from the capital city held an evening party at the Beijing Theater to celebrate the successful conclusion of the first Beijing Municipal Workers' Congress and the establishment of the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, and to commemorate the 27th anniversary of the "February 7th" Strike. Liu Laifu, Vice Chairman of the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, spoke at the evening party. He pointed out that the gains of this Workers' Congress were: clearly defining the guiding principle of trade union work—everything for the restoration and development of production; formally establishing the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions; and, what is even more worthy of celebration for the workers of Beijing is that Comrade Peng Zhen was elected as Chairman. At this congress, the connection between the trade union and the masses was strengthened, all proposals were discussed by everyone, and outstanding representatives were elected as committee members. After the closing of the congress, we must conscientiously implement the resolutions of the congress and implement the spirit of the congress. We hope that the representatives will serve as the backbone and do a good job in production. Finally, he remembered the martyrs who died in the "February 7th" Strike, saying: Today's victory—workers becoming masters of the country and society—is inseparable from their bloodshed. The martyrs will live forever! Then the Beijing People's Art Theater performed "Moscow Character."
