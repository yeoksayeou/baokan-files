　　Qian Junrui of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association Speaks
    Calls for Propaganda of the Sino-Soviet Treaty to Smash the Shameless Rumors of the US-Chiang Clique
    All Sectors of the Country are Excited and Encouraged; Support the Sino-Soviet Brotherly Alliance
    [Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 15th] Qian Junrui, Secretary-General of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, made a statement in celebration of the signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance, and Mutual Assistance and other agreements, saying:
    The signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance, and Mutual Assistance and the two agreements on the Chinese Changchun Railway, Lushun, Dalian, and loans is not only an epoch-making event in the history of Sino-Soviet relations, but also, as Vyshinsky said, "a most significant contribution to the cause of consolidating world peace and democracy." Therefore, not only will the Chinese and Soviet people warmly celebrate this event, but the people of the world will certainly warmly welcome it. These treaties and agreements first consolidate the victory of the Chinese people and ensure that we can achieve new and greater victories in the construction of New Democracy. This is another extremely important help given by the Soviet government and people to the Chinese people. We should deeply thank the Soviet government and people, and deeply thank Marshal Stalin.
    The signing of this treaty gave a head-on blow to the US imperialism's conspiracy to support Japanese aggressive forces and provoke Sino-Soviet relations. Due to the signing of these treaties and agreements, US imperialism and its running dogs in the East have definitely suffered a major defeat, while the Chinese people, the Soviet people, and the people of the world have definitely won another major victory in the struggle to consolidate peace in the Far East. The strength of the world's democratic and peaceful camp has thus been further strengthened and far exceeds the strength of the aggressive camp. We Chinese people will undoubtedly shoulder even greater responsibilities in the democratic and peaceful camp headed by the Soviet Union. The signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance, and Mutual Assistance has opened a new era of Sino-Soviet friendly relations. Starting from this point, we will more completely and more satisfactorily develop and consolidate the deep and great friendship between the people of China and the Soviet Union. The more than two million members of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association should enthusiastically call for, promote, organize, and participate in the celebration and propaganda activities for the signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance, and Mutual Assistance in various places. Local Friendship Association organizations should use this treaty as their powerful weapon to carry out widespread and in-depth propaganda and education work among the masses in urban and rural areas, so that everyone can further understand the Soviet Union and the significance of Sino-Soviet friendship; and, based on the contents of these treaties and agreements and the ironclad historical facts, criticize narrow nationalist ideas, refute the shameless rumors spread by imperialists and Kuomintang reactionaries about the so-called "Chinese Changchun Railway issue," "Luda issue," "Outer Mongolia issue," etc., so that the people of the whole country can improve their thinking and better unite to oppose the provocations and slanders of US imperialism and its running dogs, and consolidate their victory. Local Friendship Association organizations should also, from this celebration and propaganda activity, massively but not formalistically expand the organization, develop members, and, on the basis of the current work, combine it well with the current specific work tasks and the actual needs of the masses, and establish and consolidate the regular work of the Friendship Association.

　　中苏友协钱俊瑞谈话
    号召宣传中苏条约粉碎美蒋无耻谣言     
    全国各界兴奋鼓舞  拥护中苏兄弟同盟
    【新华社北京十五日电】中苏友好协会总干事钱俊瑞为庆祝中苏签订友好同盟互助条约及其他各项协定，发表谈话称：
    中苏友好同盟互助条约和中苏关于中长路、旅顺、大连和贷款的两个协定的签订，不仅是中苏关系史上划时代的大事，同时正如维辛斯基所说：“对于巩固全世界的和平与民主的事业，是一个最重大的贡献。”因此，不仅我们中国人民和苏联人民热烈庆祝这件事，全世界人民也一定热烈欢迎它。这些条约和协定首先巩固了中国人民的胜利，并且保证我们能够在新民主主义建设中获得新的更大的胜利。这是苏联政府和人民对中国人民又一次作了极其重大的帮助。我们应该深深感谢苏联政府和人民，深深感谢斯大林大元帅。
    这个条约的签订，对美帝国主义扶植日本侵略势力、挑拨中苏关系的阴谋，给了当头一棒。由于这些条约和协定的签订，美帝国主义及其在东方的走狗确定地吃了个大败仗，而中国人民、苏联人民和全世界人民，在为巩固远东和平的斗争中，则确定地又打了个大胜仗。世界民主和平阵营的力量由此而更加加强，更加远远地超过了侵略阵营的力量。我们中国人民在以苏联为首的民主和平阵营中无疑地将担负起更加重大的责任。中苏友好同盟互助条约的签订，开辟了中苏友好关系的新时代。以此为起点，我们将更加完整和更加圆满地发展和巩固中苏两国人民的深厚和伟大的友谊。中苏友好协会的二百多万会员，应该在各地热烈地号召、推动、组织和参加对这次签订中苏友好同盟互助条约的庆祝宣传活动。各地友协组织应该以这次的条约作为自己的有力武器，在城乡群众中展开普遍深入的宣传教育工作，使大家进一步地了解苏联，了解中苏友谊的意义；并根据这些条约和协定的内容和铁一般的历史事实，批驳狭隘的民族主义思想，驳斥帝国主义者和国民党反动派所散布的关于所谓“中长路问题”、“旅大问题”、“外蒙问题”等等的无耻谣言，使全国人民在思想上提高一步，更好地团结一致，反对美帝国主义及其走狗们的挑拨和中伤，巩固自己的胜利。各地友协组织还应从这一次庆祝宣传活动中，大量地但不是形式主义地扩大组织，发展会员，并在目前工作的基础上，与各地当前的具体工作任务与群众实际需要，很好地结合起来，建立和巩固友协的经常工作。
