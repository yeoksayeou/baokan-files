　　Various Places Over the Years Adopt Various Methods to Train 200,000 Intellectuals
　　Already Dispatched to Various Departments to Participate in Construction Work

　　[Our Newspaper News] Reporter Jin Feng reports: The transformation and training of intellectuals in newly liberated areas has achieved great results in the past year. According to preliminary statistics from the four regions of Northeast, North China, East China, and Northwest, a total of 200,000 intellectuals were trained last year, including: 90,000 in East China, 87,000 in North China, 23,000 in Northwest, and 6,000 in Northeast. After short-term education, most of them have initially established the idea of serving the people, and actively participated in the war to eliminate remnants of bandits and various construction works of the new China.

　　The duration of education in various places varies from several weeks to more than half a year. The education methods are generally divided into three types: The first is to run short-term revolutionary universities or specialized training classes (such as North China People's Revolutionary University, East China Military and Political University, Northwest People's Revolutionary University, etc.), recruiting various intellectuals who are interested in participating in revolutionary work, and providing them with several months of short-term political and ideological education. The second is to hold summer vacation seminars and training courses, concentrating faculty and staff from universities and primary and secondary schools for political study, mostly combined with professional study. The third is the training class for old civil servants, mostly organized by the taking-over units according to the taking-over system, such as the old personnel training classes of thirteen units under the North China People's Government and the intellectual training classes of the East China Finance and Economics Office. Among them, the number of people trained using the first method is the largest, with approximately 120,000 people in North China, East China, and Northwest combined.

　　Running Various Schools and Training Classes to Concentratedly Solve Major Ideological Problems

　　Due to different circumstances in various places, the training content is also not entirely consistent. Generally, it centers on the history of social development, combined with explanations of basic issues of the Chinese revolution and current affairs policies.

　　The learning method adopts the principle of combining theory with practice. The specific methods generally include large class reports, group discussions, and individual self-study combined. Criticism and self-criticism are carried out in the group at any time, using the newly learned ideas and viewpoints to criticize the original old ideas and work styles. At the end of the study, most of them conduct ideological summaries. The students use the basic principles of Marxism-Leninism to analyze and criticize their own history and old ideas, write a summary by themselves, and then conduct democratic evaluation by the group. This is to improve the students' understanding and consolidate the learning results. Because most of the training is short-term, there are various mass movements throughout the training to promote learning, such as the movement to stabilize learning emotions and living order upon initial enrollment, the democratic election of learning organizations and living organizations, learning competitions, labor competitions, ideological summary movements, and the establishment of the Party and the League. In these movements, a large number of activists emerged, forming a backbone, promoting learning, and keeping the students' learning enthusiasm always full, so that certain learning results can be achieved in a short time.

　　After short-term study, the ideological development process of students in various places is roughly the same, basically with the following situations: (1) Initially cleared up the intellectuals' sense of superiority and supra-class ideology, and the wrong views on American imperialism, initially established class viewpoints and labor viewpoints, and began to establish a worldview of serving the people. (2) More deeply recognized the crimes of the Kuomintang, and many people confessed their relationship with reactionary parties. Among the 12,000 people in the first phase of the North China Revolutionary University, 2,500 Kuomintang members, Three People's Principles Youth League members, and secret agents confessed and turned in 32 pistols. In the summer study in Beijing, among the 5,800 primary and secondary school teachers and staff, 610 confessed their reactionary organizational relationships. (3) Gradually recognized the decisive role of the Chinese Communist Party in the Chinese revolution, and the vast majority of people are willing to follow the Communist Party. A large number of CCP members and Communist Youth League members were developed in the study. For example, in the first phase of the North China Revolutionary University, 200 people joined the Party and 4,000 joined the League.

　　After the study, except for most of the students in the faculty and staff training class returning to their original schools to serve, and the old personnel also being placed in work according to their original agency systems, the vast majority of the tens of thousands of students who graduated from the first type of training method—revolutionary universities and specialized training classes—obeyed the organization and were dispatched to work in various places. The North China Bureau and the Northwest Bureau of the CPC Central Committee have issued instructions requesting veteran cadres in various places to pay attention to and unite with this large number of intellectuals who have newly joined the revolutionary work, so as to cultivate them to better serve the people in practical work. According to news from various places, most of these new cadres showed enthusiasm for work after arriving at their work posts, were not afraid of hardship, and humbly learned from the masses and veteran cadres, so they made rapid progress.

　　The experience of transforming intellectuals in various regions is: (1) The learning content should be small and refined, focusing on solving the main ideological problems of the students. The method is to educate the students to master the two basic viewpoints of historical materialism—class viewpoint and labor viewpoint—to clear up reactionary and backward old ideas, gradually establish correct viewpoints, and lay the foundation for continued ideological transformation in the future. If there is too much content, it is easy to become superficial and cannot deeply solve the main ideological problems. (2) Pay attention to cultivating the backbone in learning, creating a mass movement of mutual education and ideological transformation to strengthen the effect of training. The leadership should consciously create mass movements with certain content at each stage from the beginning according to the training plan, continuously discover activists from the movements, unite around the leadership, play a leading role, and educate them to patiently and sincerely help the masses learn, so as to achieve the goal of solving the main ideological problems in a short time. (3) Pay attention to enthusiastic care for students in life during training, promote unity and fraternity among students, and appropriately organize visits to factories and rural areas, organize labor and recreational activities, which can play a certain auxiliary role in ideological transformation.

　　各地年来采取各种方式
    训练知识分子廿万
    已派赴各部门参加建设工作
    【本报讯】记者金凤报道：新解放地区知识分子的改造与训练工作，去年一年内获得巨大成绩。据东北、华北、华东、西北四区初步材料统计，去年共训练知识分子二十万人，计：华东九万人，华北八万七千人，西北两万三千人，东北六千人。经过短期教育后，他们大都初步建立了为人民服务的思想，并积极参加了肃清残匪的战争与新中国的各项建设工作。
    各地进行教育的时间，自数星期至半年以上不等。教育方式大抵分为三种：第一种是举办短期的革命大学或专科训练班（如华北人民革命大学、华东军政大学、西北人民革命大学等），招收有志参加革命工作的各种知识分子，施以数月的短期政治思想教育。第二种是举办暑假研究会讲习班等，集中大中小学教职员进行政治学习，大半并结合进行业务学习。第三种为旧公务人员的训练班，多由接管单位按接管系统分别举办，如华北人民政府所属十三个单位的旧人员训练班、华东财经办事处知识分子训练班等。其中以采用第一种方式训练的人数为最多，华北、华东、西北三地共约十二万人。
    举办各种学校和训练班  集中解决主要思想问题
    各地因情况不同，训练内容亦不完全一致。一般以社会发展史为中心，结合讲解中国革命基本问题及时事政策等。
    学习方法均采用理论与实际相结合的原则，具体作法一般是大课报告、小组讨论、个人自学相互结合进行。小组中随时展开批评与自我批评，以所学的新思想新观点批判原有的旧思想旧作风。至学习告一段落时，多进行思想总结。由学员以所学的马列主义基本原则来分析批判自己的历史及旧思想，由本人写一总结，再由小组进行民主评定，这样来提高学员认识，巩固学习成果，由于多是短期训练，故在训练中自始至终有着各种群众性的运动，推动学习进行，如初入学时的安定学习情绪及生活秩序的运动，民主选举学习组织及生活组织的运动，学习竞赛，劳动竞赛，思想总结运动，以及建党建团等。在这些运动中，大批积极分子涌现出来，形成骨干，推动学习进行，使学员学习情绪始终饱满，故能在短时间内收到一定的学习效果。
    经过短期学习后，各地学员的思想发展过程大致相同，基本上有下列的情况：（一）初步清算了知识分子的优越感和超阶级思想，和对美帝国主义的错误看法，初步建立了阶级观点及劳动观点，开始建立了为人民服务的人生观。（二）较深切地认识了国民党的罪恶，不少人坦白了与反动党派的关系，华北革命大学第一期一万二千人中有两千五百个国民党员、三青团员、特务等进行了坦白，并交出了手枪三十二支。北京市暑期学习中，五千八百个中小学教职员中，有六百一十人坦白了反动组织关系。（三）逐渐认识了中国共产党在中国革命中的决定作用，绝大多数人愿意跟着共产党走。学习中发展了大批中共党员及青年团员。如华北革命大学第一期入党的有二百人，入团的有四千人。
    学习后除教职员训练班学员大部分返回原有学校服务，旧有人员亦多按原属机关系统安插工作外，凡属第一类训练方式——革命大学及专科训练班毕业的十数万学员，绝大部分都服从组织，被派赴各地工作。中共中央华北局及西北局为此曾发出指示，要求各地老干部注意宝贵并团结这大批新参加革命工作的知识分子，以便在实际工作中培养他们更好地为人民服务。据各地消息，这批新干部到达工作岗位后，多数都表现对工作热情，不怕艰苦，虚心向群众及老干部学习，因而进步很快。
    综合各地区改造知识分子的经验是：（一）学习内容应少而精，集中解决学员的主要思想问题，办法是教育学员掌握历史唯物论的两个基本观点——阶级观点及劳动观点，以之清算反动落后的旧思想，逐步建立正确观点，并为以后继续改造思想打下基础。如内容过多，反而容易流于浮泛，不能深入解决主要思想问题。（二）注意培养学习中的骨干，造成群众性的互相教育、改造思想的运动，以加强训练的效果。领导上一开始应即有意识地按照训练计划，造成每一阶段一定内容的群众性的运动，从运动中不断发现积极分子，团结在领导周围，起推动带头作用，并教育他们耐心诚恳地帮助群众学习，以此达到短期内解决主要思想问题的目的。（三）训练中注意对学员在生活上的热情照顾，在学员中提倡团结友爱。并适当组织参观工厂、农村，组织劳动及文娱活动，这对于改造思想能起一定的辅助作用。
