Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, February 25th: The Shandong Provincial Heavy Industry Production Conference, held in early February, has drafted the province's 1950 heavy industry production and construction plan. This year's production policy for Shandong's heavy industry is to focus on recovery and construction based on needs and possibilities. The plan for this year specifies strengthening coal mine equipment to put coal mines on the path to regular and safe production. The planned annual coal production volume will increase by 57 percent compared to last year's total production. In terms of electricity, plans are in place to vigorously carry out repairs and increase power equipment by 7 percent, increasing the province's reliable power generation capacity by 45 percent compared to last year. The gold production plan will also increase by 44 percent compared to last year's production. Specific production and construction plans have also been drafted for other mines such as iron sand, coking coal, sulfur, graphite, and asbestos, as well as factories for machinery, electrical equipment, and cement. In addition, the plan stipulates the completion of the construction projects for acid production and steelmaking factories this year. To ensure the completion of the annual plan, the Provincial Heavy Industry Production Conference pointed out that it is necessary to resolutely implement the enterprise management policy, implement the economic accounting system to overcome blindness in production, improve efficiency, and emphasize quality; at the same time, democratic management should be implemented, and worker technical cadres should be trained in a planned manner. Shandong's heavy industry production has been initially restored in the past year, and the total annual value of heavy industry production is equivalent to 1.5 billion catties of grain. In addition to self-sufficiency, Shandong's coal production has strongly supported the needs of Shanghai, Nanjing, and Central China. Since the Jinan Machinery Industry Bureau shifted to peaceful production in July last year, it has successfully trial-produced a five-foot automatic lathe and has begun manufacturing machines needed by mines. Due to the recovery of production, workers' lives have also been initially improved. The wages of workers and staff have increased by an average of 20 percent compared to the Japanese and Kuomintang rule periods.

　　山东省重工业生产会议
    拟定今年生产建设计划
    全年煤产增加百分之五十七  发电容量提高百分之四十五
    【新华社济南二十五日电】二月上旬举行的山东全省重工业生产会议，已拟订出一九五○年全省重工业的生产建设计划。今年山东重工业的生产方针是根据需要和可能，有重点地进行恢复建设。今年计划中确定加强煤矿设备，使煤矿走上正规安全生产。全年计划产煤量较去年全年产量增加了百分之五十七。电力方面计划大力进行整修工作，并增加电力设备百分之七，使全省可靠发电容量较去年提高百分之四十五。产金计划亦较去年产量增加百分之四十四。其他如铁砂、炼焦、硫磺、石墨、石棉等矿和机械、电气、洋灰等工厂亦都拟订了具体的生产建设计划。此外计划规定在今年内完成制酸和炼钢等工厂的建设工程。为了保证全年计划的完成，全省重工业生产会议指出必须坚决实行企业化方针，贯彻经济核算制度，以克服生产中的盲目性，提高效率，重视质量；同时应实行民主化管理，有计划地培养工人技术干部。按山东重工业生产在去年一年中已初步恢复起来，全年重工业的生产总值折合粮食十五亿斤。山东煤产除自用外曾有力地支持了上海、南京和华中的需要。济南机械工业局自去年七月转入和平生产后，已试制五英尺自动车床成功，并开始制造矿山需用的机器。由于生产的恢复，工人生活亦得到了初步改善。工人职员的工资较之日本和国民党统治时期平均增加了百分之二十。
