　　Model Worker Zhou Yueting
    Beijing Workers' Congress Delegate Interview, Part 4
    Cheng Min
    Zhou Yueting, a carpenter at the North China Agricultural Machinery General Factory, was elected as an outstanding model worker during the democratic evaluation.

    He is only twenty-two years old this year and started as a carpentry apprentice at the age of twelve. He was originally very diligent and always wanted to improve his life through his own labor, but under the dark rule of the old society, he could not even get enough to eat despite his hard work. He was disappointed and gradually became a "sleepy bug" who avoided work.

    At the beginning of the liberation, the factory had not yet started operations, and the People's Government gave workers four catties of relief grain every day. He was deeply moved by this. He thought, "Giving grain before starting work is unprecedented. The current government truly belongs to the people!" Therefore, he restored his past diligent spirit and took the initiative to organize fellow workers to risk stepping on landmines, transporting large trees felled by the bandit army from two or three miles away to repair the office and dormitory doors and windows damaged by the bandits.

    Between May and June last year, the factory had not yet formally produced agricultural machinery and first manufactured a 1,500-pound capacity pulping machine for the People's Paper Mill. The carpenters (model makers) had to make wooden blades, washing drums, and other components. The task was arduous, and time was tight. The workers had never done it before, and there was a lack of materials. At that time, there were few veteran workers, many temporary workers, and a lack of organization and education. Therefore, when the workers saw that the work was urgent, they demanded higher wages and refused to work properly. To overcome this difficulty, Zhou Yueting first patiently persuaded these new workers. He told the new workers, "The benefits are coming! In the future, the factory will develop day by day, and workers will have all kinds of welfare benefits. As long as you work well, you can be promoted to formal workers and even get awards!" He persuaded the occasional mischievous ones, saying, "Can you guarantee that everyone will have work to do outside? Besides, ten catties of millet (the daily wage at that time) is much better than under the Kuomintang!" In this way, the attitudes of many workers gradually changed. Soon, several people became advanced elements in production and were promoted to formal workers.

    He not only did this himself but also organized veteran workers Yue Jun and Yue Qingquan to unite and help the new workers. They took care of the new workers in everything, arriving early and returning late, setting an example for their apprentices and new workers. He himself took the lead in everything, playing a model role. Once, while working, the wood was wet and needed to be baked. Rows of wooden boards were placed in a fire pit more than four feet deep for baking. The bottom layer was too low and difficult to take out after baking. It was burning with crackling sounds and was about to catch fire. He resolutely jumped into the fire pit and quickly threw the wooden boards up one by one, rescuing the wooden boards and avoiding a fire. His hands were covered in blisters.

    He is not only diligent and brave but also uses his brain, dares to research and create, and constantly improves and enhances his skills. There was a broken-down electric saw in the factory that, after only three to five minutes, and only after sawing a five-foot-long piece of wood, would the blade become hot and squeak, unable to move any further. He thought, "This is worse than manual labor!" After thinking for three days, he finally came up with a solution: using tap water, he put rubber hoses on it, opened holes at both ends, and sprayed water on both sides of the blade to reduce friction and lower the temperature. In this way, the machine now doesn't have to stop all day, and it can saw more than a thousand pieces of wood a day, increasing efficiency tenfold compared to sawing a hundred pieces a day in the past. Last year, when manufacturing a large number of horse-drawn plows, the wooden handles needed to be bent. In the past, they were baked one by one over a fire and then bent, which was very laborious. He designed an iron frame to clamp a dozen of them together for baking, saving two-thirds of the time. He pays great attention to quality, refinement, and sturdiness when working. In the past, the foot pedals of the threshing machine were not durable, so he took the initiative to research and add a piece of wood under the two horizontal boards so that the foot pedals would not touch the ground and would not be easily damaged.

    When making the washing drum inside the pulping machine, the factory estimated that it would take 720 workdays; however, because he mobilized the workers to scientifically organize labor and improved the technology, it was completed in only more than 290 workdays. For example, when sawing wood, originally two people pulled one piece, but he used an iron frame to clamp four or five pieces of wood together to prevent them from sliding, so one person could pull the saw, which saved a lot of labor. Last year, the factory made more than 2,600 sets of Liberation-style weeders. The two wooden handles at the top of each weeder (about four or five inches long and an inch thick) required a total of two to three hundred cubic feet of wood. He called on everyone to accumulate and use as much waste material from each job as possible, and as a result, they made it without using a single piece of whole material.

    Because he can actively think of ways and mobilize fellow workers to work together, the carpentry workshop saved more than 800 workdays and more than 1,000 cubic feet of material last year. If calculated at the general market price of ten catties of millet per workday and three catties of millet per cubic foot of material, it saved a total of more than 10,000 catties of millet. This played a significant role in reducing the factory's costs.

    In terms of production, their carpentry workshop successfully completed and exceeded its tasks every time, becoming one of the best work units in the entire factory.

　　劳动模范周月亭
    北京工代大会代表访问之四
    程敏
    华北农业机械总厂木工周月亭，在民主评选时当选为优秀的劳动模范。
    他今年才二十二岁，从十二岁就开始当木工学徒。他本来十分勤劳，总想用自己的劳动来改善自己的生活，但在旧社会的黑暗统治下，终日辛勤还是不得一饱。他失望了，渐渐变成了一个逃避做工的“瞌睡虫”。
    解放之初，工厂还未开工，人民政府便给工人每天发四斤救济粮。为这件事，他深深地感动了。他想：“还没做工就发粮，这是从来没有的事情，现在的政府真是人民的了！”于是，他恢复了过去勤奋的精神，自动组织工友冒着踏地雷的危险，把匪军砍倒的大树从二、三里外运回来，修理匪徒们破坏了的办公室与宿舍门窗。
    去年五、六月间，该厂尚未正式生产农业机械，先替人民造纸厂制造一千五百磅容量的打浆机。木工（模型工）要做木刀片、洗鼓等要件。任务艰巨，时间紧迫，工人们过去没做过，又缺乏材料。当时老工人少，零工多，而且还缺乏组织与教育，所以工人们看见活紧，就闹着要加工资，不肯好好干。周月亭为了克服这个困难，首先耐心地去说服这些新工友。他对新工友讲：“好处在后头呢！将来工厂一天天发展，工人福利什么都有，只要你们工作好，能升正式工，还能得奖！”对个别调皮的劝说道：“你能保证大家出去都有活做吗？再说，十斤小米（当时的每日工资）比国民党时强多了！”这样许多工人，态度渐渐转变了。不久，好几个人竟成了生产中的先进分子，升任了正式工人。
    他不独自己这样做，还组织老工友岳珺、岳清泉等也去团结与帮助新工人。他们事事照顾新工人，每天早到晚归，给徒弟和新工友们做榜样。他自己更是事事带头，起模范作用。有一次做活，木料湿，要用火烤，把一排排木板放进四尺多深的火坑里烤。最底的一层太低，烤干后不易拿出，烧得劈哩拍拉直响，眼看就要烧着了。他毅然纵身跳下火坑，迅速把木板一块块扔上来，抢救了木板，避免了火灾，他的双手都烧起了大泡。
    他不仅勤奋勇敢，并且爱用脑子，勇于研究创造，不断地改进与提高技术。厂内有一架破旧的电锯，用不上三五分钟，刚锯一块五尺长的木头，刀片热得吱吱作响，不能再动了。他寻思：“这比人工还不如呀！”捉摸了三天，终于想出一个办法：利用自来水，将上胶皮管，两端开孔，向刀片两面浇水，减低磨擦力，使温度下降。这样一来，机器现在整天不用停，一天可锯一千多根木头。比过去一天锯一百根提高效率十倍。去年大量制造马拉犁，木柄要弯形的。以前是一根一根用火烤了再弄弯，非常费劲。他设计了一个铁架子，把十几根夹起来一齐烤，节省时间三分之二。他做活非常注意质量，注意精巧和坚固。从前，脚蹬打谷机的蹬板不耐久，他即自动研究，在两片横板下面加一块木板，使脚蹬不着地，不易损坏。
    做打浆机内的洗鼓时，厂内估计要七百二十个工；但由于他发动工人科学地组织劳动，又改进了技术，只用二百九十多个工就完成了。比如锯木头，本来二人拉一块，他利用一个铁架子把四五块木头夹起来，使它不滑动，一人用锯即可拉下，这就节省了好多人工。该厂去年共做二千六百多部解放式耘锄，每部耘锄上端的二把木柄（约长四五寸，宽厚寸许），合起来要用二三百方尺木料。他号召大家尽量把每次做活的废料都积累下来，加以使用，结果竟没有用过一块整料就做成了。
    由于他能积极想办法，并动员工友一齐努力，去年木工房共节约了八百多个工，一千多方尺料。若按一般市价十斤小米一个工，三斤小米一尺料计算，就总共节约了一万多斤小米。这对于工厂的降低成本是起了很大的作用。
    在生产方面，他们的木工房每次都胜利完成并超过任务，成为全厂最好的工作单位之一。
