　　North China Military Region's Beijing and Tianjin General Hospitals
    Strictly Manage Water and Electricity Consumption
    Saving Over 200,000 Jin of Rice in Eight Months

    [Our Newspaper's Report] The Beijing and Tianjin General Hospitals affiliated with the North China Military Region have achieved great success in conserving water and electricity. From April to December of last year, Tianjin General Hospital saved over 30,000 tons of water and 110,000 kilowatt-hours of electricity, while Beijing General Hospital saved 20,000 tons of water and 50,000 kilowatt-hours of electricity. Calculated at one jin of millet per ton of water and per kilowatt-hour of electricity, the total savings amounted to over 200,000 jin of rice.

    In the past, the water and electricity consumption of the Beijing and Tianjin General Hospitals was astonishing. For example, Tianjin General Hospital, with approximately 1,000 staff members, consumed over 26,000 kilowatt-hours of electricity and over 10,000 tons of water per month. Later, after the higher-level supply organs personally investigated and researched, and with the repeated mobilization, education, and inspection by the hospital leaders and responsible comrades of the supply management department, the entire hospital staff became aware of the importance of water and electricity conservation, established a system, and adhered to it.

    First, under the principle of not hindering work, the number of unnecessary light bulbs and wattage was reduced, saving 900 kilowatt-hours of electricity per month from this measure alone. Private electric stoves were completely eliminated, with a total of 151 being removed from the Beijing and Tianjin hospitals. Furthermore, a strict lighting control system was established. In Tianjin General Hospital, in areas where lights were concentrated (such as patient areas, dormitories, etc.), the number of lights and wattage were checked, and then an appropriately sized fuse was installed based on the total wattage. In this way, if any light bulbs were added or the wattage increased, the fuse would blow, making it easy to detect and inspect. At the same time, the fuse was installed in a locked wooden box to prevent tampering. In addition, night patrols were organized to supervise and inspect the turning off of lights and closing of water taps, as well as to carry out fire prevention and anti-theft work.

    In addition, the hospital appointed specific personnel to be responsible for leading workers to inspect water and electricity lines. As a result, the Beijing hospital found one leak and also blocked some unnecessary water taps. According to incomplete statistics, these leaks had previously wasted over 4,000 tons of water per month. Tianjin General Hospital found seven leaks, including three instances of nearby residents stealing water. They also found a No. 14 electrical wire inserted into the ground, resulting in a daily loss of approximately 70 kilowatt-hours of electricity, as well as one instance of nearby neighbors stealing electricity.

    In order to draw everyone's attention, eye-catching signs such as "Save Electricity" and "Conserve Water" were hung on electric switches and water taps, which also played a certain role.

    Due to the emphasis placed on water and electricity conservation by the leadership of these two hospitals, the consumption of water and electricity has decreased month by month. They are now continuing to study and improve the situation.

　　华北军区京津两个总医院
    严格管理节用水电
    八个月节约折米二十余万斤
    【本报讯】华北军区所属京津两个总医院节用水电很有成绩。从去年四月起至十二月，天津总院节用水三万余吨。电十一万度，北京总院节用水二万吨，电五万度。如每吨水，每度电都以一斤小米计算，共节省米二十余万斤。
    过去京津两个总院水电消耗数量惊人。如天津总院工作人员一千人左右，每月用电二万六千余度，用水一万余吨。后来经过上级供给机关亲自调查研究，和医院首长及供给管理处负责同志的反复动员教育和检查，在水电节用上，引起全院人员的重视，建立了制度，并坚持了制度。
    首先在不妨碍工作的原则下，减少了不必要的灯头数和烛光数，仅此一项每月就省电九百度。私人电炉一律取消，京津两院共取消一百五十一个。并且建立了严格的灯光管制制度。天津总院在集中用灯的地方（如病人区、宿舍等），检查了用灯的数目和烛光数后，根据烛光总数，配装一个适当用量的保险丝，这样，如有增加灯头或增大烛光时，保险丝就会烧断，便于发觉检查，同时保险丝按装在加锁的木匣里，以防改换。此外，夜间组织巡视小组，督促检查熄灯和关闭水门，并进行防火防盗工作。
    另外，医院又指派专人负责，带领工人，按水电线路进行检查。结果，京院查出漏水一处，还堵死一些不必要的水门，据不完全统计，过去每月由这些地方漏水达四千余吨。天津总院查出七处漏水，内有邻近居民偷水的三处。并查出十四号电线插入地下，每日损失电约七十度，及附近邻居偷电一处。
    为了引起大家的注意，在电门水门上都挂上“节电”“节省用水”等醒目的牌子，也起到一定的作用。
    由于该两院领导上对水电节用的重视，使用水电的数字逐月减少。现在他们仍在继续研究改进中。
