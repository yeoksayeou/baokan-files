　　One of the Largest National Projects
    Sanggan River Silt Irrigation Project in Chahar Province
    Measurement and Design Work Completed
    (Xinhua News Agency, Zhangjiakou, 11th) The measurement and design work for the Sanggan River in Chahar Province, one of the largest projects in the country, for the 500,000 mu silt irrigation project in the Shanyin and Yingxian sections, has been completed. Various construction materials are now being prepared, and construction will begin in full swing after the spring warms up. The Sanggan River originates in Shuoxian County and flows into the Yongding River at Zhuguantun in Zhuolu County, Hebei; it is 376 kilometers long. The riverbed has an elevation difference of two meters per kilometer, so the water flow is turbulent and carries a lot of sediment, causing great harm to the downstream. In order to reduce downstream sediment and silt irrigation of 500,000 mu of barren land in Shanyin and Yingxian, the Chahar Provincial People's Government decided to build silt irrigation canals in the above two counties and formed a silt irrigation engineering team of more than 50 people. They set off to the construction site in late September last year to carry out measurement and design work. By mid-January of this year, after more than 100 days of hard work, the team had completed the measurement and design work for the South Main Canal, four branch canals, and the East Main Canal of the Guangji Water Conservancy Company. The total length is 178 kilometers. The Sanggan River Silt Irrigation Project Office has now been formally established and is uniformly leading the preparation of various tasks. According to the survey, this silt irrigation project is extremely large, requiring a total of 2,970,269.46 cubic meters of earthwork and 895,704 man-days of labor. In order to solve this huge labor problem, the project office convened a canal earthwork and labor meeting. At the meeting, the leaders of the Chahar Provincial Garrison took on all the earthwork tasks; after the meeting, they personally went to various construction sites to survey and arrange the work. It is estimated that more than 20,000 local garrison troops will participate in this project. The project office has appropriately solved the supply and storage of food, daily necessities, tools, etc. for the troops during the construction period through the Water Conservancy Promotion Committee. Regarding transportation issues: A total of 530 large carts are needed to transport the materials for the entire project for 100 days. In order to complete this task before the spring warms up, the county heads of Shanyin and Yingxian counties have consulted with the负责人负责 of the Chahar Provincial Transportation Company and agreed that, without hindering agricultural production, Shanyin and Yingxian counties will jointly organize 550 large carts to transport materials. In addition to using some trucks to specifically transport cement, the transportation company has also booked 140 large carts in Zhangjiakou and Datong to assist in transportation. Various materials required for the project have also been planned. The Ministry of Agriculture of the Central People's Government has ordered 12,000 dan of cement for canal construction, 7,000 cubic meters of stone and brick have been prepared, more than 10,000 trees have been exchanged for cloth for timber, and lime is being organized for mass production by the people, with more than 400,000 kilograms already produced.

　　全国最大工程之一
    察省桑乾河淤灌工程
    测量设计工作完成
    【新华社张家口十一日电】全国最大的工程之一，察哈尔省桑乾河山阴、应县段五十万亩土地淤灌工程的测量设计工作已经完成。现正准备各种修筑材料，春暖后即将全面动工。桑乾河源出朔县，至河北涿鹿县朱官屯入永定河；流长三七六公里。该河河底每公里高差二公尺，因此，水流湍激，冲挟泥沙很多，流至下游为害甚大。为减少下游泥沙和淤灌山阴、应县一带五十万亩瘠地，察省人民政府决定在上述两县兴修淤灌渠道，并组成五十余人的淤灌工程队，于去年九月下旬出发至施工地点进行测量和设计工作。至今年一月中旬止，经一百余天的艰苦工作，该队已全部完成南干渠一道、支渠四道和广济水利公司东干渠一道的测量设计工作。全长共计一七八公里。现桑乾河淤灌工程处已正式建立，正统一领导各项准备工作的进行。据勘测，此项淤灌工程极为浩大，共需土方二九七○二六九．四六立公方，需人工八九五七○四个工。为解决这一巨大的人工问题，工程处曾召开了渠道土、工会议。会上察省驻军首长全部承担了土工的任务；会后并亲赴各施工地点勘察布置，预计当地驻军将有二万余人参加这一工程。工程处已通过水利促进委员会适当地解决了施工期间部队粮食、日用必需品、工具等的供应和储藏问题。关于运输问题：全部工程的料物等共需五百三十辆大车运送一百天。为争取在春暖前完成此一任务，山阴、应县两县县长已和察省运输公司负责人商妥，在不妨碍农业生产的原则下，由山阴、应县两县共组织五百五十辆大车运输材料；运输公司除以一部分汽车专门转运洋灰外，并在张家口和大同两地订好大车一百四十辆协助运输。工程所需各项物料，也都筹划就绪。修渠道所用洋灰已由中央人民政府农业部订了一万二千担，石料和砖已准备好七千余公方，木料已用土布换得一万余株树木，石灰正在组织人民大量生产，现已出四十余万公斤。
