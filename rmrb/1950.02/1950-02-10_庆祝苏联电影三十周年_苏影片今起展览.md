　　Celebrating the 30th Anniversary of Soviet Cinema
    Soviet Film Exhibition Opens Today
    [By Our Staff Reporter] To celebrate the 30th anniversary of Soviet cinema and to coincide with the Spring Festival cultural activities, the Soviet Film Exhibition, jointly sponsored by the Film Bureau of the Ministry of Culture and the Soviet Film Export Company, begins today. It is scheduled to continue for twenty-four days, from February 10th to March 5th. A total of thirty-eight works will be shown in the capital. At the same time, similar large-scale exhibitions will also be held in cities such as Tianjin, Shenyang, and Shanghai. As is well known, Soviet cinema is the most progressive in the world. These films realistically and vividly reflect the new deeds and new figures in the Soviet socialist revolution and construction—the most outstanding and perfect models of human character. And watching Soviet films is one of the convenient ways for us to learn from the Soviet Union.

    苏影片今起展览
    【本报讯】为庆祝苏联电影三十周年并配合开展春节文艺活动，文化部电影局与苏联影片输出公司联合主办的苏联影片展览从今天开始。准备继续二十四天，自二月十日至三月五日截止。首都共演出三十八部作品。同时，在天津、沈阳、上海等城市，也有同样规模的展览。如众所周知，苏联电影是全世界最进步的。这些影片真实、生动地反映了苏联社会主义革命与建设中的新的事迹和新的人物——人类性格最优秀最完美的典型。而通过看苏联电影，是我们向苏联学习的方便方法之一。
