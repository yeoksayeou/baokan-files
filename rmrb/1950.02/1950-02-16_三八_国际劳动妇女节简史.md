　　A Brief History of "March 8th" International Working Women's Day
    The International Working Women's Day on March 8th originated from the struggle of female workers in Chicago, USA, on March 8th, 1909. On that day, female workers in Chicago held a grand strike and demonstration to fight for freedom and equality, which was enthusiastically responded to by the broad masses of working women in the United States. In 1910, the Second International Socialist Women's Conference was held in Copenhagen, the capital of Denmark. The German women's leader, and also the leader of the world's revolutionary women, Clara Zetkin, proposed at the conference that March 8th be designated as International Working Women's Day in order to strengthen the unity and liberation of international working women. The conference unanimously adopted Zetkin's proposal and put forward proposals such as implementing "eight-hour work system," "equal pay for equal work," "maternity protection," and "protection of child labor." When commemorating the first March 8th in 1911, working women in Germany, Austria, Sweden, Denmark, the United States and other countries held demonstrations. In this way, the commemoration of "March 8th" became popular all over the world.
    The "March 8th" commemoration in 1917, in Russia, played an important role in the outbreak of the February Revolution on March 12th of that year (February 27th in the Russian calendar). At that time, female workers in Petrograd, the Russian capital, under the leadership of the Russian Communist Party, held demonstrations against hunger, against the imperialist war, and against the Tsarist system. Workers in Petrograd launched a city-wide general strike to provide assistance. In the struggle of the workers to seize the old Russian army on the eve of the February Revolution, the masses of female workers actively participated. When the officers ordered the army to fire on the workers, the female workers bravely rushed to the front, seized their guns, spoke directly to the soldiers, expressed their joy with them, and called on them to help the people overthrow the Tsarist system. This struggle of the female workers greatly promoted the participation of the Petrograd army in the revolutionary uprising. Therefore, in 1923, "March 8th" International Working Women's Day was designated as a national revolutionary anniversary by the Soviet Union.
    Chinese women first commemorated their own liberation festival in 1924. Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, working women in Guangzhou united with women from all walks of life who were oppressed and held a grand commemoration meeting in the First Park, putting forward slogans such as "Down with imperialism," "Down with warlords," "Equal pay for equal work," "Protect child laborers and pregnant women," "Equal education," "Prohibit child brides and polygamy," "Prohibit keeping maids and concubines," and "Establish children's protection laws," and marched in formation. From 1925 onwards, the commemoration of "March 8th" gradually became popular in major cities. From then until now, the "March 8th" festival has been enthusiastically commemorated by the Chinese women.
    "March 8th" Women's Day was born in the struggle of international working women for women's liberation and international solidarity. The history of "March 8th" illustrates the significant role of working women in the revolutionary movement and the women's movement. Only by taking them as the foundation, taking them as the vanguard, and uniting with other working people and uniting women from all walks of life who are oppressed to fight together can women's liberation be realized.

　　“三八”国际劳动妇女节简史
    三月八日的国际劳动妇女节，起源于一九○九年三月八日，美国芝加哥女工的斗争。在那一天，芝加哥的女工为争取自由平等，举行了盛大的罢工与游行示威，得到了美国广大劳动妇女热烈的响应。一九一○年国际第二次社会主义者妇女大会，在丹麦京城哥本哈根开会。德国的妇女领袖、也是世界革命妇女的领袖蔡特金在大会提议，为了加强国际劳动妇女的团结和解放，订三月八日为国际劳动妇女节。大会一致通过了蔡特金的提议，并提出实行“八小时工作制”、“同工同酬”、“保护母性”、“保护童工”等提案。在一九一一年纪念第一个三八节的时候，德、奥、瑞典、丹麦、美国等国的劳动妇女都举行了示威游行。这样“三八”的纪念就在全世界流行了。
    一九一七年的“三八”节纪念，在俄国，对于当年三月十二日（俄历二月二十七日）二月革命的爆发，起了重要的作用。当时的俄国首都彼得格勒的女工，在俄国共产党的领导下，举行了反对饥饿、反对帝国主义战争、反对沙皇制度的示威。彼得格勒工人们举行了全城总罢工，加以援助。在二月革命前夜的工人们夺取旧俄军队的斗争中，女工群众积极参加。当士官命令军队向工人开枪时，女工们英勇地冲到前面，夺取了他们的枪枝，直接向士兵说话，和他们表示联欢，号召他们来帮助人民推翻沙皇制度。女工们这种斗争，大大地推动了彼得格勒军队参加革命起义。所以到一九二三年，“三八”国际劳动妇女节被苏联规定为全国的革命纪念日。
    中国妇女第一次纪念自己解放的节日，是在一九二四年，在中国共产党的领导下，广州的劳动妇女联合了各界被压迫妇女在第一公园举行盛大的纪念会，提出了“打倒帝国主义”、“打倒军阀”、“同工同酬”、“保护童工孕妇”、“同等教育”、“禁止童养媳多妻制”、“禁止蓄婢纳妾”，“建立儿童保护法”等口号，并列队游行。从一九二五年起，“三八”节的纪念就逐渐普及于各大城市。从那时到现在，每年的“三八”节都被中国的妇女群众所热烈纪念。
    “三八”妇女节是在国际劳动妇女争取妇女的解放和国际团结的奋斗中产生的。“三八”节的历史，说明了劳动妇女在革命运动中和妇女运动中的重大作用。只有以她们为基础，以她们为先锋，和其他劳动人民在一起，团结各阶层被压迫妇女，共同奋斗，才能实现妇女的解放。
