Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, February 14th: The full text of Mayor Chen Yi's speech at the Shanghai People's Rally Against the US-Chiang Bombing Atrocities and to Mourn the Dead Compatriots on the evening of the 12th is as follows: Fellow compatriots! Fellow comrades!

　　Tonight, representatives from all walks of life in Shanghai are holding a memorial service to mourn the compatriots who died in the "February 6th" bombing. Nearly 500 compatriots were killed and more than 600 were injured in the bombing on February 6th. This is a serious incident. We express our deep condolences to the deceased compatriots. We must avenge them. We express our sympathy and condolences to the injured compatriots, hoping that they will quickly recover from their injuries so that they can join us in avenging the dead compatriots. The bombs of the US-Chiang bandits fell on the deceased compatriots, just as they fell on us. Their injuries and deaths are just like the injuries and deaths of our family members. The pain and bitterness are shared, and our hatred for American imperialism and the Chiang bandit gang is also shared. The workers and compatriots who were killed sacrificed themselves for the construction of the new Shanghai. Their sacrifice will forever be remembered by the citizens of Shanghai. Our mourning is not just to express sadness and pain, but to be brave and calm. We are holding this representative meeting here, representing six million citizens, and shouting a slogan. This slogan is: Resolutely oppose American imperialism, quickly eliminate the Chiang bandit gang, and avenge the dead compatriots!

　　The US imperialist and Chiang bandit blockade and bombing will only increase their crimes and accelerate the demise of the remaining bandits.

　　It has been more than eight months since Shanghai was liberated. Eight months of history is worth recalling. Shanghai was liberated on May 27th last year, and by June 23rd, the enemy began its armed blockade at sea, trying to force us to bow to imperialism and restore imperialist rule in Shanghai and cancel the victories we, the people, have won through armed blockade. However, we resolutely carried out the anti-blockade, put forward six major tasks, and we will never bow to imperialism, nor will we show weakness to the enemy. The facts of eight months have proved that the enemy's blockade has not achieved its intended purpose, and proved that we Chinese people can live without relying on imperialism. Moreover, we have made considerable achievements in taking over Shanghai and establishing the people's democratic life in Shanghai. Therefore, US imperialism began to take the second step on February 6th—bombing. The Chiang bandit's bombing of Shanghai on February 6th was approved by US imperialism, in an attempt to destroy Shanghai by bombing. From blockade to bombing is the specific policy of US imperialism towards the people of Shanghai. We hereby warn US imperialism that your blockade and bombing will not only fail to achieve your goals, but on the contrary, will only increase your own crimes and accelerate the demise of the Chiang bandit gang.

　　In the bombing on February 6th, the Party, government, army and people from all walks of life in Shanghai worked together to carry out rescue, fire extinguishing and repair work. The people of Shanghai remained calm and were not panicked. For example, because the street lights were out, 60,000 soldiers and police were dispatched throughout the city to form patrol teams to maintain public order; factory, school, and neighborhood residents formed self-defense teams and pickets to assist the military police in patrols. Workers and engineering personnel of various public utilities worked day and night to repair, regardless of wind and rain, so that many bombed areas were partially repaired; medical and health personnel worked tirelessly all night to treat and rescue the wounded; various agencies and organizations quickly dispatched relief, so that 50,000 disaster victims initially received food and shelter. Party, government, and military leaders worked all night to supervise the emergency response work. These showed the heroic spirit of the Shanghai people, and the order was well maintained. The Shanghai people have great revolutionary unity and can withstand the test. The revolutionary unity of the Shanghai people is the greatest revolutionary driving force, and any difficulty can be overcome. The US-Chiang bombing cannot scare us.

　　Compatriots and comrades! It is the nature of imperialism and the Chiang bandit gang to express their hatred for the people who have gained liberation and freedom, and they will never relax when they have the opportunity to exert their bestial destruction. The bombing on February 6th is proof of this. The US-Chiang bombing will continue, and our anti-bombing work should also be intensified. We should strengthen air defense work, consider camouflage and evacuation of significant targets; properly prepare for the maintenance of water and electricity supply, and still have alternative methods in case of water and electricity cuts. I hope that technical experts and workers of all factories can play a greater positive role and creativity in this regard. We should strengthen the preparation for fire prevention and fire extinguishing, investigate explosives, and bury and transfer them; flammable items should be properly handled. All fire extinguishers should be re-examined. The Public Security Bureau Fire Brigade should make more efforts to make full preparations. The people's volunteer fire brigade should be organized immediately. Public and private hospitals and medical personnel throughout the city should be organized and mobilized to serve air defense and anti-bombing. Special care should be given to the rescue of workers and poor people. People who are unemployed in Shanghai should consider evacuating and moving to the interior. A city as large as this, with six million people crowded together, is very dangerous to be bombed. Our working methods, production methods, and organizational forms should be appropriately changed to meet the requirements of air defense evacuation. For example, street parades, waist drum playing, Yangko dancing, and large mass gatherings during the day should not be held. Nighttime lighting control and air raid warning systems should be established quickly. We, the people of Shanghai, must remember more clearly that before Taiwan is liberated, we should be prepared to oppose the US-Chiang bombing at any time. All deployments should be considered to meet the requirements of air defense evacuation. If the above work is done well, it is entirely possible to reduce losses and gain more security.

　　I believe that the people of Shanghai, who have a deep revolutionary tradition, relying on our revolutionary unity, and working hard to prepare for overcoming bombing and destruction, will surely be able to withstand the test of the US-Chiang bombing and stand up more bravely!

### 陈毅号召上海人民依靠革命团结反对美蒋轰炸

　　陈毅号召上海人民依靠革命团结反对美蒋轰炸
    【新华社上海十四日电】陈毅市长十二日晚在上海市各界人民反对美蒋轰炸暴行追悼死难同胞大会上的讲话全文如下：各位同胞们！各位同志们！
    今晚上海各界代表举行追悼会，追悼“二六”轰炸被难的同胞。二月六日那天被炸死的同胞近五百人，受伤者六百余人。这是一个严重事件。我们对被难同胞表示沉痛的哀悼。我们一定要为他们复仇。我们对受伤的同胞表示同情和慰问，希望他们迅速治好创伤，以便同我们一道去为死难同胞复仇。美蒋的炸弹落在被难同胞身上，正如落在我们身上一样。他们的伤和死，正如我们家里人的伤和死一样。沉痛和酸楚是共同的，我们对美国帝国主义和蒋匪帮的愤恨也是共同的。被难的工友和同胞们，他们是为了新上海的建设而牺牲。他们的牺牲永远在上海市民的纪念中。我们的追悼并不仅是表示悲伤、沉痛，而应该勇敢沉着。我们在此举行代表会，代表六百万市民，喊出一个口号。这口号就是：坚决反对美国帝国主义，迅速消灭蒋匪帮，为被难同胞复仇！
    美帝蒋匪的封锁轰炸，只有增加罪恶和加速残匪的灭亡。
    上海解放到现在八个多月了。八个月的历史很值得回忆一下。上海去年五月二十七日解放，到六月二十三日，敌人就开始海上武装封锁，想用武装封锁的办法，逼使我们向帝国主义低头，以恢复帝国主义在上海的统治，取消我们人民已获得的胜利。但是，我们坚决进行反封锁，提出了六大任务，我们决不向帝国主义低头，我们决不向敌人示弱。八个月的事实证明，敌人的封锁并未达到其预期的目的，证明我们中国人民不依靠帝国主义也是可以生活的。而且我们在接管上海、建立上海的人民民主生活上有了相当成就。因此，美帝国主义就在二月六日开始采取了第二个步骤——轰炸。二月六日蒋匪对上海的轰炸是美帝国主义批准的，企图用轰炸来摧毁上海。从封锁到轰炸是美帝国主义对上海人民的具体政策。我们在此警告美国帝国主义，你们的封锁轰炸不仅达不到你们的目的，相反的只有增加你自己的罪恶和加速蒋匪帮的灭亡。
    在二月六日的轰炸中，全上海党政军和各阶层人士一致努力作救护、灭火和修复工作，上海人民是沉得住气的，并不惊惶失措。例如：由于街灯失明，全市军警出动六万人，组成巡逻队，维持治安；工厂、学校、里弄居民组成自卫队、纠察队、协助军警巡查。各公用事业的工友、工程人员，昼夜努力抢修，不避风雨，使许多被炸毁的地方得到局部修复；医卫人员彻夜不停努力治救；各机关各团体迅速出动救济，使灾民初步获得食宿的达五万人。党政军首脑都彻夜办公，督导应变工作。这些，表现了上海人民的英勇气概，秩序井然。上海人民有革命的伟大团结，是经得起考验的。上海人民的革命团结是最伟大的革命动力，任何困难都可以克服，美蒋的轰炸是吓不倒的。
    同胞们同志们！对获得解放和自由的人民表示其仇恨，遇有机会能发挥其兽性的破坏时一定不放松，这本是帝国主义和蒋匪帮的天性。二月六日的轰炸便是证明。美蒋轰炸还会继续，我们反轰炸的工作也应该加紧进行。我们应加强防空工作，考虑显著目标的伪装与疏散；妥善筹备水电供应的保持，万一水电断绝时，仍然有代替办法。我盼望各技术专家和各厂工友，在此能发挥更大的积极性与创造性。我们应加强防火灭火的准备，清查爆炸物，并将其埋藏和转移；对易燃的物品应有妥善处理。一切灭火器应重加检查。公安局消防队应更努力作充分准备。人民志愿消防队应立即组织起来。公私医院和全市医卫人员应有组织地动员起来，为防空反轰炸服务。对工友和贫苦人民的救护，更应特别关心。在上海无职业的人们应考虑疏散和向内地搬移。六百万人拥挤一团，这样大的城市，遭受轰炸是很危险的。我们的工作方式、生产方式、组织形式均应适当改变，以适防空疏散的要求。例如在街上结队游行、打腰鼓、扭秧歌、白天大的群众集会，均不得举行。夜间灯火管制和防空警报制度均应迅速建立起来。我们上海人民要更清楚记住，在台湾未解放之前，应随时准备反对美蒋轰炸。一切部署均应考虑适合防空疏散的要求。上述工作做得好，则完全可能做到少受损失，多得安全。
    我相信，深具革命传统的上海人民，依靠我们的革命团结，努力作各种克服轰炸破坏的准备，一定能在美蒋轰炸中经得起考验，更勇敢地站立起来的！
