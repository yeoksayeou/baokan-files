Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, February 21st: New China's people's railway enterprises have achieved great results by adopting the advanced management system of the Soviet Union and implementing the crew responsibility system.

The crew responsibility system in railway management is a system based on the political foundation that the working class has become the master of the country. The method is to assign a certain locomotive to a certain crew (composed of nine crew members in three shifts, also known as a chartered crew), and the crew is fully responsible for the driving and maintenance of the locomotive. This system of the people's railways was learned from the Soviet Union. This system is the opposite of the rotational system implemented in all capitalist countries and in China's railways in the past. The so-called rotational system is to allocate the locomotives of the entire section to the crew members of the entire section for rotation, and at the same time set up many inspectors to inspect the locomotives. In the past, accidents occurred frequently in places where this system was implemented in China's railways, and the efficiency of locomotive operation was extremely low. In places where the crew responsibility system was implemented, the situation was just the opposite.

The Northeast Railway first implemented the crew responsibility system the year before last. After the implementation of the crew responsibility system, the status of the crew members underwent a fundamental change. They became more conscious masters of the locomotives, their sense of responsibility was greatly strengthened, and accidents were greatly reduced. For example, in the past, when the Linkou Locomotive Depot implemented the rotational system, there were as many as 20 locomotive heating accidents in a month. In the two months after the implementation of the crew responsibility system, the accidents were completely eliminated. On the basis of a general reduction in accidents, many model locomotives have emerged in the Northeast Railway over the past year. In February of last year, the "Iron Ox," which was rebuilt from a broken car by the Suihua Locomotive Depot, first created a new record of more than 100,000 and 6,000 kilometers of safe travel in the history of Chinese railways, breaking the two Class A inspection periods stipulated by the Northeast Railway Bureau. Then the "Mao Zedong," "884," caught up later, and recently the "631" even broke three Class A inspection periods, with a safe travel of 180,000 kilometers. In the "Iron Ox Movement" launched since September last year, 126 "Iron Ox Locomotives" have emerged. Following the implementation of the crew responsibility system in the Northeast, the crew members in the north and south also caught up quickly. Last year, 37 locomotives in the Tianjin Bureau extended the prescribed Class A inspection kilometers, and the best No. 1939 also traveled safely for 100,000 kilometers. Since the National Locomotive Affairs Conference decided to implement the crew responsibility system nationwide in June last year, the safe mileage of locomotives on the northern and southern railways has increased by an average of one time.

The above achievements in reducing accidents and improving locomotive operating efficiency are mainly the result of the crew responsibility system greatly improving the sense of responsibility of the crew members. After the implementation of the crew responsibility system, the crew members cherish the locomotives they drive as they cherish their own bodies. For example, the "Iron Ox" had a fault when the arch brick jammed the grate bar during the cleaning of the furnace. The driver Liu Yucai immediately used coal to suppress the fire, covered his mouth with a wet towel, soaked his shoes in water, and drilled into the fire room to knock off the arch brick. Once, "884" driver Zhang Zhong had already fallen ill on the way, but after arriving at the station, he received an emergency shunting order, so he insisted on working for 28 hours while ill. Many crew members of the Fengtai Locomotive Depot even busied themselves scraping off the rust and oil stains left on the locomotive for many years during the few minutes of stopping at the platform. When materials were lacking, they found ways to solve the problem themselves, and many crew members automatically returned the previously hidden public property to replenish locomotive equipment. Crew members often drive back in the middle of the night, but still check the locomotive carefully before going to sleep. Because the Nanjing Locomotive Depot lacked cotton for wiping cars, the Ju Zhanhua crew jumped into the pond to cut aquatic plants to replace it. The stoker of the crew, Yu Guoxiang, was gloriously injured when he encountered a Kuomintang plane strafing the train because he refused to leave the locomotive before the work was completed.

The responsibility system is a system unique to the Soviet Union that relies on the working masses to manage state-owned enterprises. It is not only applicable to the crew, but also can be extended to other aspects of railway management. The crew responsibility system has begun to exert its leavening effect in China's railway work.

Now, in addition to the "three guarantees" system of "contracting the crew, contracting the repair, and contracting the guidance," which has been expanded in the locomotive work, there are also the dispatching responsibility system, the road maintenance responsibility system, and the material supply responsibility system, which have been established and have achieved considerable results. Due to the establishment and implementation of these systems, a new morality has begun to be established among railway workers in general, that is, it is an supreme glory to be truly responsible for the property of the country and the tasks entrusted by the country, and on the contrary, it is considered a great shame.

The experience of the crew responsibility system proves that only by combining the labor enthusiasm of the working class with the advanced experience of the Soviet Union can the people's enterprises be run well.

### 铁道企业向苏联学习经验实行乘务负责制  各路事故普遍减少  机车运行效率提高

　　铁道企业向苏联学习经验实行乘务负责制
    各路事故普遍减少  机车运行效率提高
    【新华社北京二十一日电】新中国的人民铁道企业由于采用了苏联的先进的管理制度，实行了乘务负责制，已取得极大成效。
    铁路管理工作中的乘务负责制是建立在工人阶级已成为国家主人这个政治基础之上的一种制度。其办法是将某一台机车交给一定的乘务组（由九个乘务员分三班组成，又称包车班）使用，乘务组对该机车的驾驶和保管负完全责任。人民铁道的这个制度是由苏联学来的。这个制度与现在一切资本主义国家及我国过去铁路所实行的轮乘制恰恰相反。所谓轮乘制，是把全段的机车配属给全段的乘务员轮流使用，同时设置很多检点员对机车进行检点。我国铁路过去实行这种制度的地方，事故经常发生，机车运用的效率是极低的。而在改行乘务负责制的地方，情形便恰恰相反。
    东北铁路在前年首先实行了乘务负责制。实行了乘务负责制以后，乘务员的地位就起了根本的变化，他们变成了机车的更加自觉的主人，责任心大大加强，从而事故大大减少。如林口机务段在过去实行轮乘制的时候，一个月间机车发热的事故达二十件。而在改行乘务负责制以后的两个月内，则完全消灭了事故。在事故普遍减少的基础之上，一年以来，东北铁路已涌现了许多模范机车。去年二月，由一辆破车修成的绥化机务段的“铁牛号”，首先创造了中国铁路史上安全行走十万零六千余公里的新纪录，突破了东北铁路总局所规定的两个甲检期。接着“毛泽东号”、“八八四号”后来居上，最近“六三一号”则更突破三个甲检期，安全行走十八万公里。在去年九月以来展开的“铁牛运动”中，已经出现了一百二十六台“铁牛机车”。继东北实行乘务负责制之后，北方、南方的乘务员们也急起直追。去年天津局管内已有三十七台机车延长了规定的甲检公里，最好的一九三九号亦安全行走达十万公里。去年六月全国机务会议决定在全国实行乘务负责制以来，北方、南方铁路的机车安全行走里程，已平均提高了一倍。
    以上这些减少事故，提高机车运行效率的成绩，主要是乘务负责制大大地提高了乘务员的责任感的结果。在实行乘务负责制之后，乘务员们便像爱护自己的身体一样来爱护自己所驾驶的机车。如“铁牛号”其次在清炉时，因拱砖把炉条卡住发生了故障，司机刘玉才立刻就用煤把火压住，口上蒙起湿毛巾，鞋子用水浸湿，钻入火室，把拱砖打落。有一次，“八八四号”司机张忠已经在行车中途病倒，但到站后又接到紧急的倒车命令，就带病坚持工作了二十八小时。丰台机务段的许多乘务员，甚至在站台停车的几分钟，都忙着刮机车上多年留下的锈和油垢。材料缺乏时，他们就自己设法解决，很多乘务员并自动交还以前隐藏的公物以充实机车设备。乘务员们时常在半夜驾车回来，但仍将机车细密检查后才去睡觉。南京机务段因为擦车的棉丝缺乏，鞠占华乘务组就跳入池塘捞割水草来代替。该乘务组司炉余国祥在遭遇国民党飞机向火车扫射时，因工作未处理完毕不肯离开机车，光荣负伤。
    负责制是苏联所特有的一种依靠工人群众管理国家企业的制度。它不仅适用于乘务，还可以推广到铁道管理的其他方面。乘务负责制在我国铁道工作中已经开始发挥了它的酵母作用。
    现在除在机务工作中已扩大为“包乘、包检修、包指导”的三包制度以外，已经建立而且收得了相当效果的还有调度负责制、养路负责制和材料供应负责制等。由于这些制度的建立和实施，一般铁道工作人员中已经开始树立了一种新的道德，就是以对国家的财产，和对国家所付予的任务切实负责引为无上的光荣，反之则认为是莫大的耻辱。
    乘务负责制的经验证明，只有把工人阶级的劳动热情和苏联的先进经验结合起来，才能把人民企业办好。
