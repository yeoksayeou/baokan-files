    [Our Dispatch] The Central People's Government Ministry of Health, in order to effectively prevent plague in Inner Mongolia and northern Chahar, has decided to establish a Plague Prevention and Treatment Center in Zhangjiakou City.  Hurqin, Deputy Minister of Health of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region People's Government and Deputy Minister of Health of the Inner Mongolia Military Region, has been appointed concurrently as the director of the center, and Jiang Tao, Director of the Chahar Health Bureau, has been appointed concurrently as the deputy director. The center will have a Department of Epidemiology and a Department of Inspection, as well as three epidemic prevention stations in Zhangbei, Kangbao, and Suiyuan (each with attached isolation wards, laboratories, diagnostic teams, etc.), and a mobile epidemic prevention team and an isolation hospital. The center's area of responsibility extends from Duolun in the east to Guihua (present-day Hohhot) in the west, from the southern end of the Xilingol League in the north to Zhangjiakou City in the south. The staff of the center gathered in Beijing and Zhangjiakou in early January to engage in technical and political study and are actively engaged in various preparations. It is expected that they will be able to go to the epidemic areas in March to carry out prevention, treatment, and research work. In order to more closely integrate with the masses, in addition to primarily undertaking plague prevention, the center also plans to concurrently handle the prevention and simple treatment of other acute infectious diseases, as well as maternal and child health work.
