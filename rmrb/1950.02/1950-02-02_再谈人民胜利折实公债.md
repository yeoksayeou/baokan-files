　　More on the People's Victory Indexed Bonds
　　Zuo Zonglun
　　Issuing government bonds is a very common method for modern countries to make up for fiscal deficits. Even capitalist countries mostly use the issuance of government bonds to easily raise huge amounts of funds; however, it must be understood that the governments of capitalist countries are governments of the exploiting classes, so issuing government bonds is also for the benefit of the capitalist class, exploiting the people. After the Kuomintang reactionary government came to power, it regarded issuing government bonds as a tool for corruption and speculation. The four major families were able to concentrate a huge amount of capital worth 200 million US dollars, and there were many ways to amass wealth, but issuing government bonds was still their good trick for making money. The government bonds issued by our People's Government this time are not like this. They are called People's Victory Indexed Bonds. They are indeed People's Bonds, Victory Bonds, and Indexed Bonds, bonds that live up to their name. Therefore, they are different from the government bonds of capitalist countries, and even more different from the government bonds of the Kuomintang reactionary government.
　　1. People's bonds are bonds designed for the people. Because the People's Government is a government that seeks truth from facts and serves the people; therefore, the People's Government must consider the people in its fiscal and economic measures. Why did the People's Government issue this bond this time? According to the instructions of the Government Administration Council: "In order to make up for the deficit, reduce the issuance of banknotes, and recall currency in a planned way, so that the prices of goods across the country in 1950 can gradually stabilize, so as to begin to guarantee the stable lives of people of all classes and the normal development of industry and commerce." Therefore, it can be seen that the government bonds issued by the People's Government are to stabilize prices and stabilize people's livelihoods; to develop industry and commerce and promote economic prosperity. When the Kuomintang reactionary government issued government bonds, they mostly mortgaged them to national banks to raise cash, and then considered the situation and distributed the bonds in the market to promote speculation. Mortgage loans and currency inflation would cause prices to rise. During this period, the speculative market was of course the most active. In this way, the corrupt government benefited, and speculative merchants also benefited, but the general public suffered greatly due to rising prices. Therefore, Article 9 of the People's Government's bond regulations stipulates: "This bond shall not be used to replace currency circulation in the market, shall not be mortgaged to national banks, and shall not be used for speculative trading."
　　2. Indexed bonds are bonds in kind. According to general practice, the issuance of government bonds are currency bonds. When prices are stable, it goes without saying that currency bonds are the most convenient to calculate. The People's Government issued this bond to absorb floating capital in the market, on the one hand to increase some income, and on the other hand to recover some currency, so that prices in 1950 may tend to stabilize. Indexed bonds are bonds in kind, and are no different in essence from indexed savings. Therefore, the issuance of indexed bonds is the People's Government's calculation to preserve capital for the people, and it is thinking from the interests of the people, unlike the Kuomintang reactionary government's issuance for the purpose of accumulating wealth for itself, which is anti-people.
　　3. Victory bonds are issued for victory. In order to make up for the deficit, victory bonds are issued on the basis of national victory. Therefore, victory bonds are construction bonds, production bonds, and bonds with a solution. Unlike the Kuomintang reactionary government's bonds, which are failure bonds, consumption bonds, and bonds without a solution. Therefore, there is no problem with the repayment of principal and interest of victory bonds. It is also fundamentally different from the Kuomintang reactionary government's bonds, which sometimes do not pay interest when due, and sometimes do not repay principal when drawn.
　　Regarding the promotion of government bonds, the principle is voluntary, and they are free bonds, not compulsory bonds. Although the instructions of the Government Administration Council state: "The target of government bond promotion should mainly be industrial and commercial operators in large, medium, and small cities, wealthy households in urban and rural areas, and wealthy retired civil and military officials." This is just hoping that these wealthy people will contribute to the country and help the government overcome the current financial difficulties encountered by the motherland in its victory. Therefore, it is further instructed: "In promoting the People's Victory Indexed Bonds, we must implement the democratic spirit, achieve fairness and rationality, and oppose forced apportionment." And according to the bond regulations: the principal and interest will be repaid one year after the drawing. It can be said that the People's Government has opened up a legitimate outlet for the floating capital of China's industrial and commercial circles. Our country has been devastated by a long revolutionary war, and the industrial and commercial capitalists and urban wealthy households in our country have not been hit by the dangers of bullets; they have not tasted the taste of chaff; their foreign buildings are intact, and their cars are undamaged. When thinking about it in the quiet of the night, whose power is this! Based on conscience, they should also contribute wealth to repay the country. It should be known that the sky in the liberated areas is a bright sky, not... the days of Emperor Shun and Emperor Yao. Wake up quickly! Respond to the government's call and use as much floating capital as possible to subscribe to government bonds, which is not only more glorious and risk-free than hoarding materials and doing illegal activities secretly, but also safer than depositing it in the banks of the declining capitalist countries!
　　As for the issue price of government bonds, it is issued at par without any discount. This is a reflection of the government's outstanding reputation. The People's Government seeks truth from facts, says what it means and does what it says, and does not issue empty checks. Everyone knows the great reputation. And it is stipulated that if the draws are made on time, the principal and interest will be repaid, and the repayment will be completed in five years. The People's Government is soliciting subscriptions in the nature of short-term government bonds, unlike the Kuomintang reactionary government, which dragged on for twenty or thirty years of long-term, or even never repaid them, and turned them into permanent government bonds to deceive the people. An annual interest rate of five percent can be said to be a very appropriate interest rate based on the current financial situation. Even in the event of price fluctuations, as mentioned above, the principal will be repaid in kind and the interest will be paid in kind, so that the people will not be affected in the slightest.
　　In short, the People's Victory Indexed Bonds are the first new government bonds issued after the birth of the People's Republic of China. All people of the People's Republic of China should actively subscribe and express their support in order to thank the country for its difficult creation. What's more, the People's Liberation Army, which has fought bravely and hard for years, must be supported, the nine million troops and public officials must be supplied, the 23.9 percent of economic construction funds must be planned, and the prices of goods across the country in 1950 must be stabilized. Chairman Mao said that we are "having difficulties, having solutions, and having hope." He gave earnest advice with a heavy heart. I believe that the people across the country will be inspired by this, and will be able to understand the "difficulties" in this victory, and do their best to think of "solutions" to welcome this wise measure of the government.

　　再谈人民胜利折实公债
    左宗纶
    发行公债，是近代一般国家弥补财政赤字的一种极寻常方法。即如资本主义国家，为目前容易筹得巨额款项，多半利用公债发行；不过要知道资本主义国家的政府，是剥削阶级的政府，所以发行公债，也就是为资本家阶级的利益，剥削人民。国民党反动政府当权以后，把发行公债，当做贪污和投机的工具。四大家族能够集中了价值达二百万万美元的巨额资本，搜括之道固多，可是发行公债，还要算他们搞钱的拿手好戏。我人民政府此次发行的公债，不是这样，它叫人民胜利折实公债，它确乎是人民公债，胜利公债，折实公债，名符其实的公债，所以，与资本主义国家的公债不同，与国民党反动政府的公债更不相同。
    一、人民公债，是为人民打算的公债。由于人民政府是实事求是为人民服务的政府；所以，人民政府在财政经济的措施上，要为人民打算。人民政府为什么要发行这次公债呢？照政务院的指示：“为了弥补赤字，减少现钞发行，有计划地回笼货币，使一九五○年全国的物价，达到逐渐稳定的程度，以开始保证各阶层人民的安定生活和工商业的正常发展。”因此可以看出人民政府发行的公债是为了稳定物价，安定民生；为了发展工商，繁荣经济。国民党反动政府发行公债，在开始，多半向国家银行抵押，通融现款，继而斟酌情况，把公债散布在市面，助长投机。抵押借款，通货便膨胀，物价便上涨，在这当中，投机市场，当然为最活跃时期。这样，贪污政府有利，投机商人也有利，可是一般人民以物价腾贵之故，便大受损害了。所以，人民政府这次的公债条例第九条规定：“本公债不得代替货币流通市面，不得向国家银行抵押，并不得用以作投机买卖。”
    二、折实公债，是实物公债。按通例，发行公债，是通货公债。在物价稳定的时候，不待说，通货公债，计算最便。人民政府此次发行公债，为吸收市面上的游资，一方面增加部分收入，一方面收回部分通货，使一九五○年的物价，可能趋于稳定。折实公债，既是实物公债，与折实储蓄，本质上并无区别。因此，折实公债的发行，是人民政府为人民保本计，是从人民的利益着想的，不像国民党反动政府发行是为敛财肥己的，是反人民的。
    三、胜利公债，是为了胜利而发行，为了弥补赤字，所以胜利公债，是在全国胜利基础上发行的。因此，胜利公债，是建设公债，是生产公债，是有办法的公债。不像国民党反动政府的公债，是失败公债，是消费公债，是没办法的公债。因此，胜利公债还本付息，是毫无问题的。与国民党反动政府的公债有时到期不付息，有时中签不还本，也根本不同。
    关于公债推销，是以自愿为原则，是自由公债，不是强制公债。虽说照政务院的指示：“公债推销的对象，主要应放在大、中、小市城的工商业者，城乡殷实富户和富有的退职文武官吏。”这也不过希望这些富豪们为国家出一把力，帮助政府克服祖国在胜利中所遇到的当前财政上的困难。所以接着又指示：“推销人民胜利折实公债，必须贯彻民主精神，做到公平合理，反对强迫摊派。”并照公债条例规定：一年以后，中签即还本付息。这可以说是人民政府替中国工商界的游资，另辟了一条正当的出路。我国经过长期革命战争，疮痍满目，而我国的工商业资本家及城市富户，子弹之险，弗中于身；糟糠之味，不及于舌；洋楼健在，汽车无恙，清夜自思，是谁之力！凭天理良心，也应该输财报国。须知解放区的天，是明朗的天，不……舜日尧天。快觉醒罢！响应政府的号召，把游资尽量认购公债，不但比囤积物资，偷偷摸摸地作违法的勾当，光荣而无风险，而且比存在正没落的资本主义国家的银行里，还稳当呵！
    至于公债发行价格，是不折不扣，平价发行。这是政府信誉卓著的反映，人民政府，是实事求是的，是说得到做得到，不开空头支票的，信誉之大尽人皆知。并且规定如按期中签者即还本付息，五年还清，以短期公债的性质向人民劝募，不像国民党反动政府拖至二十年三十年的长期，甚至永无偿还之日，而变为永远公债，以欺骗人民。年息五厘，按照当前金融情况，可以说是极适当的利率。就是万一物价波动，如上所述，本以实还，利以实付，不使人民受着丝毫的影响。
    总之，人民胜利折实公债，是中华人民共和国诞生后第一次发行的新公债，凡为中华人民共和国的人民，应该踊跃认购，表示拥护，以答谢国家缔造的艰难。何况是为了连年英勇苦战的解放军，必须支援，九百万的军队和公教人员，必须供给，百分之二十三点九的经济建设经费必须筹划，一九五○年全国的物价，必须稳定。毛主席说我们是“有困难的，有办法的，有希望的。”谆谆告诫，语重心长。相信全国同胞受此感召，必能理解这胜利中的“困难”，尽最大的努力，去想“办法”，以迎接政府这一英明措施。
