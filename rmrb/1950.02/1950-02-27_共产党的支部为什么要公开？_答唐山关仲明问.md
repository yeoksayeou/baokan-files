　　Why Should Communist Party Branches Be Public?
　　——Answering Questions from Guan Zhongming of Tangshan
    The Communist Party is the party of the most progressive class in history—the proletariat. It wholeheartedly struggles for the liberation of the proletariat and all mankind. Therefore, the Communist Party supports, elucidates, and adheres to the truth, and never hides the truth from the masses. The Communist Party always tries everything possible to widely and publicly disseminate its true propositions to the masses. When the national and class enemies, still dominant in political, military, and economic strength, launched military and espionage attacks against the liberated areas from both inside and outside; and during the period when they implemented fascist rule in their controlled areas, the Party had to temporarily adopt secret methods to carry out activities in certain departments of the liberated areas. In enemy-controlled areas, in addition to making as much use as possible of the objectively existing legal and semi-legal possibilities in the Party's various work departments to carry out public activities, all other organizations and work needed to be carried out more strictly underground, so as to enable the Party to consolidate and develop. Now that the whole country has been basically liberated and the national power has been grasped by the people, it would be wrong if the Party were not to go public again. From all experiences of making the Party public, it can be proved that: making the Party public among the masses, exposing all the good and bad phenomena within the Party to the masses, being supervised by the masses, and being criticized and supported by the masses, educates both Party members and the masses, and makes the Party and the masses closer.

　　共产党的支部为什么要公开？
　　——答唐山关仲明问
    共产党是历史上最进步的阶级——无产阶级的政党，它是全心全意为无产阶级及全人类的解放事业而奋斗。因此，共产党是拥护、阐明与坚持真理的，从不在群众面前隐瞒真理。共产党总是想一切办法，将自己真实的主张广泛地公开传播到群众中去。当民族的阶级的敌人，在政治、军事、经济各方面力量尚占优势、对解放区进行军事的、特务的内外夹攻；在它统治区内实行法西斯统治的时期，党不得不在解放区的某些部门中暂时采取秘密的方式去进行活动；在敌人统治区，除了尽可能去利用在党的各个工作部门内客观上存在着合法的与半合法的可能去进行公开的活动外，其他的一切组织和工作，都需要作更严密的地下活动，从而使党获得巩固与发展这是完全必要的。现在全国已基本上解放，全国的政权已掌握到人民手中，在这个时候，如果党再不公开，就是错误的。从所有公开党的经验中，可以证明：在群众中公开党，把党内一切好的与坏的现象，公开于群众之前，为群众所监督，为群众所批评与拥护，这样既教育了党员，又教育了群众，使党与群众更加密切起来。
