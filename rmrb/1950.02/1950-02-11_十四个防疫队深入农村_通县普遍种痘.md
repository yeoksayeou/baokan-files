　　Fourteen Epidemic Prevention Teams Go Deep into Rural Areas
    Universal Vaccination in Tong County
    [Report from this newspaper] The North China Public Health Personnel Training Class stationed in Tong County recently joined forces with local Chinese and Western doctors to form fourteen epidemic prevention teams, which went deep into the rural areas of Tong County to carry out work to eradicate smallpox and provide vaccinations. The county has a dense population (Tong County has a population of about 310,000, and Tong Town has a population of over 50,000) and convenient transportation (only 40 miles from Beijing). However, before liberation, there were no public health facilities. Infectious diseases were rampant every year. Last spring, smallpox and measles were prevalent. In October of last year, the North China Public Health Personnel Training Class sent a working group to cooperate with local Chinese and Western doctors to vaccinate people in the rural areas of Tong County. However, due to limitations in manpower and time, the vaccination work could not be popularized. On January 23 this year, the training class working group discovered six smallpox patients in Yujiawu Village in the fifth district of Tong County and Jianfa Village in the sixth district. They immediately reported this to the Ministry of Health of the Central People's Government. The Ministry of Health immediately issued 2,500 dozen doses of vaccinia and instructed the class and the local government to carry out universal vaccination and quickly eradicate smallpox. The training class and the Tong County Commissioner's Office immediately formulated a work plan. The Commissioner's Office also convened an emergency health administration meeting and decided to establish an epidemic prevention committee, based on the faculty and graduates of the North China Public Health Personnel Training Class, and in cooperation with local Chinese and Western doctors, to form fourteen epidemic prevention teams to work in Tong County and Tong Town. The epidemic prevention teams set off on January 28 and went deep into the rural areas to vaccinate households one by one, and to investigate, isolate, and disinfect smallpox patients. The training class staff and local doctors who participated in the epidemic prevention work were very enthusiastic. Everyone carried their luggage to the countryside and worked together actively. They also unified vaccination techniques, strictly disinfected, and broke with the old methods of cutting with a knife until bleeding or planting several pox on one arm. Since the beginning of the epidemic prevention work, it has received strong cooperation from local village cadres and land reform work cadres. Propaganda and mobilization work was carried out before vaccination, such as posting slogans and writing blackboards. The Tong County People's Education Center produced comic strips, and the training class organized a drama propaganda team to accompany the epidemic prevention team to rural areas for publicity. Therefore, the masses were very enthusiastic in asking the epidemic prevention team to vaccinate them.

　　十四个防疫队深入农村
    通县普遍种痘
    【本报讯】驻通县的华北公共卫生人员训练班与当地中西医最近联合组成十四个防疫队，深入通县农村，展开扑灭天花与种痘工作。该县人烟稠密（通县人口约三十一万，通镇约五万余），交通便利（距北京仅四十多里），但在未解放前，一直没有公共卫生设施。传染病每年流行很厉害。去年春天，还流行着天花和麻疹，去年十月间，华北公共卫生人员训练班曾派出工作组协同当地中西医在通县农村种痘。但因人力与时间限制，种痘工作未能普及。今年一月二十三日，训练班工作组在通县五区于家务村、六区尖法村两处发现天花患者六人。当即报告中央人民政府卫生部。卫生部立即发下牛痘苗二千五百打，并责成该班与当地政府，进行普遍种痘，并迅速扑灭天花。训练班与通县专署当即制定工作计划，专署并召开了紧急卫生行政会议，决定成立防疫委员会，以华北公共卫生人员训练班教员及毕业学员为基础，配合当地中西医生组成十四个防疫队，分赴通县与通镇工作。防疫队已于一月二十八日出发，深入农村，挨户种痘；并进行天花患者的调查、隔离、消毒等工作。参加防疫工作的训练班工作人员与当地医生都很热情，大家背着行李下乡，团结一致积极工作；并统一了种痘技术，严密消毒，打破过去用刀割流血或一个手臂上种几颗痘的老办法。防疫工作开始以来，获得当地区村干部及土地改革工作干部的有力配合。在种痘前开展了宣传动员工作。如贴标语，写黑板报等。通县民教馆并制了连环画，训练班又组织了戏剧宣传队随同防疫队到农村宣传。因之，群众请防疫队种痘的非常踊跃。
