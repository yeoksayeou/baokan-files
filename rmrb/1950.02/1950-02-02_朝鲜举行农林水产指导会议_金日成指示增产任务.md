　　Korea Holds Agricultural, Forestry and Fishery Guidance Conference
    Kim Il-sung Instructs on Production Increase Tasks
    This year, new agricultural tools and farming methods will be promoted to increase total rice production by 15.9 percent, and cattle, pigs, sheep, etc. will be greatly increased.
    [Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 1st] The Korean Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry held a joint conference of leading cadres of agriculture, forestry, and fisheries on January 24th and 25th to summarize the implementation of the Second Year People's Economic Plan by the agricultural, forestry, and fishery sectors last year and to arrange this year's work. More than 350 responsible cadres from agricultural production, forestry, fisheries, irrigation, sericulture in each province, and local agricultural experiment stations and training classes attended the meeting. Chairman Kim Il-sung and Vice-Chairman Park Heon-young of the Cabinet also attended the meeting for guidance. The meeting heard a report by Minister of Agriculture and Forestry Park Mun-gyu on "Summary of the Implementation of the Plan by the Agricultural, Forestry, and Fishery Sectors in 1949 and Tasks for 1950," and discussions were held. Finally, the meeting passed a resolution on the report of Minister of Agriculture and Forestry Park Mun-gyu and a resolution on "Progress of Spring Sowing Preparations."
    Chairman Kim Il-sung delivered a speech after the discussion at the meeting, pointing out that although there was a severe drought in 1949, the achievements of the agricultural and forestry sectors were still very great. Last year, 626,490 tons more rice and more than 45,000 tons of cotton were harvested than in 1944. Therefore, the difficulty of food shortage in North Korea has not only been fundamentally resolved, but also grain reserves have been accumulated for the government. There has also been great success in increasing livestock. In 1949, the number of cattle increased by 18 percent compared to 1948, pigs increased by 56.7 percent, and sheep increased by 34 percent.

　　朝鲜举行农林水产指导会议
    金日成指示增产任务
    今年将推广新农具新农作法，使米谷总产量增加百分之十五点九，并大量增殖牛猪羊等。
    【新华社平壤一日电】朝鲜农林部为总结农林水产部门去年执行二年人民经济计划的情形并布置今年的工作，特于一月二十四、二十五两日召开农林水产指导干部联席会议。出席会议的有各道农产、山林、水产、灌溉、蚕业及各地农事试验场训练班等负责干部三百五十余人。部长会议主席金日成、副主席朴宪永，亦亲临指导。会议听取了农林部长朴文奎关于《一九四九年农林水产部门实行计划总结和一九五○年度任务》的报告，并进行了讨论。会议最后通过关于农林部长朴文奎报告的决议和《春季播种准备工作进行情形》的决议。
    金日成主席在会议讨论完毕后，发表演说指出：一九四九年虽然有严重的旱灾，但农林部门所获的成绩，仍然很大。去年比一九四四年多收获了六十二万六千四百九十吨米谷和四万五千余吨棉花。因此，不仅从根本上解决了北朝鲜食粮不足的困难，而且还给政府积蓄了存粮。家畜的增殖也有很大成绩。一九四九年，牛的头数较一九四八年增殖了百分之十八，猪增殖了百分之五十六点七，羊增殖了百分之三十四。
