Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou, February 13th. The crime of the Japanese troops spreading bubonic plague bacteria in Ningbo City in 1940 to kill Chinese people has been further substantiated through interviews with citizens who were victims and witnesses at the time. Qian Guifa, an apprentice at the Yuan Tai Shao Hotel, one of only two people saved out of the ninety-nine plague patients in Ningbo at the time, said: “On October 22, 1940, a single-winged Japanese plane flew in very low from the northeast, dropping a lot of wheat, flour, and chestnuts in the Kaiming Street and Donghou Street area. At the same time, it distributed leaflets with the flags of Japan, Germany, and Italy, and two hands shaking, signifying ‘Sino-Japanese Friendship.’ The leaflets roughly said that Chongqing was suffering from famine, and the people were in dire straits, while the Japanese people had ample food and clothing, and even had surplus grain to help you. The Japanese troops attempted to deceive us with these words on the leaflets. The next day, there was a heavy rain, and the flour and other things that fell on the roof were washed to the ground. By the 30th, the neighboring tofu shop owner, Lai Fusheng, and his wife had both died of illness. That night, He Fulin from our shop also fell ill and died in less than a day. At that time, news spread from other shops that people were dying of sudden illnesses, and everyone was very anxious. Who knew that I would also develop a fever and headache that night, and at the same time, my lymph nodes swelled and ached, and my limbs thrashed about. Later, in the hospital, I saw that the patients who were admitted with me all died one after another, and I was the only one who escaped death.”

Zhong Hui, who worked in the Ningbo Plague Prevention Committee at the time, said: After the plague occurred, those patients in the isolation ward told me that when the Japanese plane flew over, they only saw a lot of wheat and chestnuts falling together, as well as many small things jumping around. Later, after I wore a white flea-proof suit and oilcloth boots to work in the epidemic area, many red-colored fleas, smaller than usual, crawled on my lower body. The families that received the most wheat had the most deaths. For example, Bao Chang Xiang Company died fourteen people, and Yuan Tai Shao Hotel died six people; the amount of wheat that fell on their houses was the most.

According to Dr. Ding Licheng, the current director of Hua Mei Hospital who participated in the treatment work at the time: According to the statistical materials of the epidemic situation of infectious diseases in Ningbo that I have preserved, there had never been any plague patients in Ningbo before 1940. After the Japanese plane dropped wheat near the Yongyao Electric Power Company on Kaiming Street in this city in 1940, the plague occurred in that area, with a total of ninety-nine people infected, of which only two were cured. After the Japanese troops occupied Ningbo in 1941, the military medical organization was very large, and they sent people to my hospital every day to inquire about whether there were any infectious disease patients. In May of the same year, a patient surnamed Wang from Northwest Village in Northwest Street sought treatment. At that time, blood was drawn for animal inoculation, and the inoculated guinea pig soon became ill and died, confirming that it was the plague. In accordance with the regulations of the Japanese military headquarters at the time, I reported this process to them, and the military doctors of the Japanese military headquarters cut off a piece of the dead guinea pig's spleen. According to the situation described by Dr. Ding, the scale of the Japanese troops' "epidemic prevention organization" and their special concern for "infectious diseases" fully demonstrate that the Japanese troops were prepared to investigate the effects of spreading plague bacteria after occupying Ningbo.

　　亲身受害的宁波市民
  　证实日寇曾散布毒菌
    【新华社杭州十三日电】一九四零年日寇在宁波市散布鼠疫细菌杀害中国人民的罪行，经记者亲往访问当时受害和目睹实况的市民，得到更确凿的证据。当时宁波九十九个鼠疫患者中仅被救活的两人之一、元泰绍酒店学徒钱贵法说：“一九四零年十月二十二日，有一架单翼日机从东北方很低地飞来，在开明街、东后街一带扔下许多小麦、面粉和粟子，同时还散发画着日、德、意国旗和有两手相握表示‘中日亲善’的传单。传单大意是说重庆正在闹饥荒，民不聊生，日本人民则丰衣足食，尚有余粮来接济你们。日寇企图以传单上的这些话来骗我们。第二天下了一阵大雨，落在屋顶上的面粉等都被冲下地来。到了三十日，邻居的豆腐店主赖富生夫妇就都病死了，当晚我们店里的何福临也染病，不到一天就死去。那时别的店也传出有人得急病而死的消息，大家非常着慌。谁知道我在那天晚上也发热和头痛起来，同时海核（淋巴腺）胀痛，手脚乱舞。后来我在医院里见到同我一起入院的病人，都相继死掉了，只有我是从死里逃生出来的。”
    当年曾在宁波鼠疫防疫委员会里工作的钟辉说：当鼠疫发生后，那些在隔离病室里的病人对我说，当日机飞来时，只见有许多麦子和粟子一齐落下来，还有许多跳动的小东西。后来我穿了白色防蚤衣和油布短统靴在疫区里工作后出来时，下半身爬着很多颜色红红的，比平常较小的跳蚤。凡是落麦最多的人家，就死人最多。像宝昌祥号死了十四人，元泰绍酒店死了六人，他两家所落麦子就是最多的。
    据当时参加治疗工作现任华美医院院长丁立成医师说：从我所保存的宁波传染病流行情况统计材料来看，一九四○年以前宁波不曾有过鼠疫病患者。一九四○年日机在本市开明街永耀电力公司附近散下麦子以后，该地就发生了鼠疫，共有九十九人染患，其中仅有二人被治愈。一九四一年日寇占领宁波后，军医机构十分庞大，并且天天派专人到我医院里查问有没有传染病患者。同年五月，西北街西北村有一王姓病人求治，当时抽血进行动物接种，接种后的天竺鼠不久即发作病死，乃证实是鼠疫。遵照当时日寇军部规定，我就把这个经过报告了他们，日寇军部的军医便将死天竺鼠的脾割了一块去。根据丁医师所谈的情形，日寇“防疫组织”的庞大，以及其特别关心“传染病”，充分地说明日寇是早有准备在占领宁波后调查其散布鼠疫菌后的效果的。
