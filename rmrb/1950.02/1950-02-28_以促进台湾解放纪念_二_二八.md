　　Commemorate "February 28th" by Promoting the Liberation of Taiwan

　　The Taiwan Incident of February 28, 1947, occurred exactly three years ago today. In these three years, the situation in China has undergone fundamental changes. The victory of the Chinese people has determined the future of Taiwan, but it still requires the joint efforts of the entire Chinese people and the Taiwan compatriots. It is very meaningful for us to commemorate the Taiwan Incident of three years ago in the capital of the People's Republic of China today.
　　Taiwan is an inseparable part of China. It was forcibly seized and annexed by Japanese imperialists as a base for launching aggression, which posed a serious threat to peace in East Asia and even the world. For this reason, the Cairo Declaration and the Potsdam Declaration initially decided that Taiwan should be returned to China. After Japan surrendered and China implemented the recovery of Taiwan, it should not only celebrate the recovery of its lost territory, but also be vigilant about shouldering a huge responsibility for world peace. China recovered Taiwan from the hands of Japanese imperialists, and only by reversing the actions of the Japanese, with the determination to safeguard peace and implement genuine democracy, can it give comfort to the Taiwan compatriots. The Taiwan compatriots groaned in pain under the oppression and exploitation of the Japanese imperialists for fifty-one years. Once they returned to the embrace of the motherland, and after the victory of the anti-aggression war, they held ardent joy and sincere expectations, thinking that they would see the light of day again and share the air of peace and freedom with the compatriots across the country under a democratic government. Unexpectedly, the rule of the Chiang Kai-shek reactionary clique disappointed the Taiwan compatriots. To use ancient Chinese political terms, "a hungry man is easily fed, and a thirsty man is easily given drink." If the Taiwan compatriots were not in extreme pain, a mass riot would never have occurred, and it would not have spread from a corner of Taipei to the entire island. The "February 28th" incident occurred less than a year and a half after Taiwan returned to the embrace of the motherland, which shows that the measures taken by the Chiang Kai-shek reactionary clique in Taiwan were indeed unbearable for the Taiwan compatriots. However, after the riot occurred, if the Chiang Kai-sheks had been willing to reflect on themselves and repent even slightly, they should have changed their brutal style. Instead, they resorted to violent suppression, massacring and detaining countless people. At the same time, they used their usual deceptive tactics to play with the Taiwan compatriots who had not been killed. The conditions promised by Bai Chongxi as the "Commissioner of Comfort" were not fulfilled in any case afterwards. After this great tragedy, the crimes of the Chiang Kai-shek reactionary clique were further exposed in the eyes of peace-loving people all over the world, which is beneficial to the cause of the Chinese people's liberation.
　　Today, the Taiwan compatriots are in even deeper water. After the complete collapse of the Chiang Kai-shek reactionary clique on the mainland, they are vainly trying to use Taiwan as their last place to resist stubbornly. I remember in November 1948, after the Chiang army was annihilated in the Huaihai Campaign, the atmosphere in Nanjing was very tense. Some people who had always opposed the civil war advocated seeking peaceful avenues again, while the most stubborn reactionaries first discussed the issue of "moving the capital," and Taiwan was mentioned at that time. However, many people within the reactionary camp also opposed going to Taiwan. Of course, they were not thinking about the people of Taiwan, let alone the people of the whole country, but only about themselves. They believed that Taiwan had experienced the "February 28th" riot, and they would not survive if they went to Taiwan. The issue of "going to Taiwan" was brought to Chiang Kai-shek, and Chiang Kai-shek only said: "I have decided not to go to Taiwan." On the day before his so-called "retirement" in January 1949, Chiang Kai-shek still said: "I have decided not to go to Taiwan." Chiang Kai-shek's words, of course, do not count. But it can also be seen what he thinks of Taiwan and the people of Taiwan. He understands very well that he will not have good results if he goes to Taiwan, and the people of Taiwan are very unfavorable to him. However, apart from Taiwan, he really has nowhere else to go. Today, he may be harboring an even more shameless fantasy: the ambition of American imperialism to use Taiwan as a base for aggression is becoming increasingly apparent, and he may be able to survive under the protection of American imperialism. Chiang Kai-shek's shameless fantasy will of course be eliminated soon. The victory of the Chinese people has determined the future of Taiwan. Taiwan will not be allowed to be used by Japanese imperialists as a base for launching aggression, and it will never be allowed to be used by American imperialists as a base for aggression. Under the victory of the Chinese people, Taiwan will, like all other parts of China, establish a people's democratic government and work together to safeguard world peace. This is undoubtedly a certainty that will be realized. However, all of us in the country must work together with the Taiwan compatriots to promote the early liberation of Taiwan, so that the Taiwan compatriots can be freed from the plight of being in deep water under American imperialism and the Chiang Kai-shek reactionary clique. This is the determination we should have when commemorating the third anniversary of the "February 28th" incident in Taiwan today.

　　以促进台湾解放纪念“二·二八”
　　邵力子
    一九四七年二月二十八日台湾事变，到今天已整整三年了。在这三年中间，中国形势起了根本的变化，中国人民的胜利已决定台湾的前途，但还须全中国人民和台湾同胞一同奋斗。我们今天在中华人民共和国首都纪念三年前的台湾事变，是很有意义的。
    台湾是中国不可分离的一部分。它被日本帝国主义者强夺吞并，作为发动侵略的基地，对于东亚乃至全世界的和平，都是一种严重的威胁。由于这个缘故，开罗宣言和波茨坦宣言中始决定台湾归还中国。日本投降了，中国实行收回台湾，不应当只是庆幸自己失地的收复，而应当警惕对于世界和平要负起巨大的责任。中国从日本帝国主义者的手中收复台湾，只有一反日本人的作为，以保卫和平的决心，实施真正的民主政治，始能给予台湾同胞以安慰。台湾同胞在日本帝国主义者压迫剥削之下痛苦呻吟，经过五十一年之久，一旦回到祖国的怀抱，又在反侵略战争胜利以后，他们是抱着何种热烈的欢欣，恳切的期望，以为从此重见天日，可与全国同胞共在民主政治之下，呼吸和平自由的空气。不料蒋介石反动集团的统治，竟使台湾同胞失望。用中国古代政治术语来说，“饥者易为食，渴者易为饮”，台湾同胞不是万分的痛苦，也决不会发生群众性的暴动，且由台北一隅而蔓延全岛。台湾在回到祖国怀抱不满一年半的时间，就有“二·二八”事变，可以看出蒋介石反动集团在台湾的措施实使台湾同胞难以忍受。但在暴动发生以后，倘使蒋介石们稍肯反省，稍能忏悔，便应当改变他们凶恶的作风。而他们竟一味以暴力镇压，屠杀拘禁，不可胜数。同时又以惯用的欺骗手段，玩弄台湾未遭杀戮的同胞，白崇禧以“宣慰大员”所允诺的条件，事后没有一件实现。经过这一次的大惨案，蒋介石反动集团的罪恶，更暴露于全世界爱好和平人士的目中，这对于中国人民解放事业是有利益的。
    今天，台湾同胞更陷于水深火热之中。蒋介石反动集团在大陆全部溃灭以后，正妄想拿台湾做他们最后负隅困斗之地。记得一九四八年十一月，蒋军在淮海战后被歼，南京空气十分紧张，一部分向来反对内战的人，主张重行寻觅和平的途径，而最顽固的反动派却首先商讨“迁都”问题，那时就有提到台湾的。但在反动派里面也很多人反对到台湾去，他们当然不是为台湾人民设想，更不是为全国人民设想，而只是为他们自己设想。他们以为台湾曾有“二·二八”的暴动，他们到了台湾是没有活路的。这一个“到台湾去”的问题，提到蒋介石的面前，蒋介石只说：“我决定不去台湾”。到一九四九年一月蒋介石在他所谓“引退”的前一天，还说：“我决定不到台湾去。”蒋介石说的话当然是不算数的。但也可以看出他心目中的台湾和台湾人民是怎样的，他十分明白他到台湾去不会有好结果，台湾人民对他是很不利的。但是，除了台湾，他实在没有可去的地方了。他在今天或许作一种更加无耻的幻想：美帝国主义想用台湾作侵略基地的野心日益显露，他或者可以在美帝国主义荫庇之下苟延残喘了。蒋介石这种无耻的幻想当然是不久就要消灭的，中国人民的胜利已决定台湾的前途，台湾不容许日本帝国主义者用作发动侵略的基地，也决不会容许美帝国主义者用作侵略基地。在中国人民胜利之下，台湾将与中国所有的地方一样，建立人民民主政权，共同为保卫世界和平而努力，这是毫无疑义必将实现的事。但是我们全国人民要与台湾同胞首先共同努力，促使台湾早日解放，使台湾同胞早得脱离在美帝国主义和蒋介石反动集团下的水深火热的处境。这是我们今天纪念台湾“二·二八”事变三周年应有的决心。
