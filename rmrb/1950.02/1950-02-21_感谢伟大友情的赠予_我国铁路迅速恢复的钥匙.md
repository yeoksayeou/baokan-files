　　Thanks to the Great Friendship's Gift
    ——The Key to China's Rapid Railway Recovery
    The railway network of mainland China, which had ceased to exist since the outbreak of the Anti-Japanese War, has been restored at an astonishing speed. Today, trains roar day and night, rushing from Changbai Mountain to the Pearl River, from the coast of the East China Sea to the northwestern plateau, connecting China's vast land, cities, and villages into a seamless whole. This is the crystallization of the Chinese people's active labor and the Soviet Union's internationalist friendship.
    Last year, just as American imperialism was supporting the Kuomintang bandit gangs in blockading our coast, the great Soviet Union signed a trade agreement with our Northeast People's Government. The July agreement had just been signed when, in September, at our request, 500 kilometers of steel rails were shipped. Without these 500 kilometers of steel rails, the rapid resumption of traffic on the Beijing-Hankou Railway and the Guangdong-Hankou Railway, which connect North and South China, would have been unimaginable.
    However, while steel rails are valuable, even more valuable is the key to rapid railway recovery that the great Soviet Union gifted to our country. This key is the advanced technology and experience of the Soviet Union in rapidly repairing railways after World War II. These advanced technologies and experiences were brought to our country by Soviet railway experts hired by our Central People's Government, and combined with the enthusiasm and fighting spirit of our working people, creating a brilliant example in the history of China's construction. For example, the Xiangjiang Bridge, which connects the two major trunk lines of Guangdong-Hankou, Xiang-Gui-Qian, took the Kuomintang bandit gangs four years to fail to repair. This time, under the guidance of Soviet experts, our railway workers completed it all in just thirty-five days. Another example is the Huaihe Bridge, which played a decisive role in the full operation of the Tianjin-Pukou Railway, which was completed in only sixty days, instead of the half year to eight months that most people had planned. This was no ordinary construction project, but a race against floods. It was precisely because it only took sixty days that it ran ahead of the flood, so that the new bridge was not washed away by the flood that surged only three days after it was built.
    Gaining time and completing urgent and arduous transportation tasks is the great significance of the rapid restoration of the national railway network. How did Soviet experts help us win time? This mainly lies in their mastery of advanced technology and experience. One of the most striking features of this technology and experience is the breaking of the old norms and standards in railway construction in capitalist countries such as the United States, Britain, and Japan in the past. For example, when repairing the Huaihe Bridge, because the project of restoring the old bridge was huge and would take too long, Soviet experts used the experience of repairing the Dnieper River Bridge in the Soviet-German War and suggested building a temporary bridge. This suggestion aroused doubts among domestic engineering circles at the time, who were afraid that this would be an extremely big adventure. Because the north bank of the Huaihe River is bottomless silt, and the south bank is solid rock, it is impossible to drive piles. However, because the Ministry of Railways adopted the Soviet experts' designed wooden caisson method, plus the Railway Corps soldiers, cadres, and divers, sailors, etc., fought selflessly with the Huaihe River, the bridge was quickly completed, and the Tianjin-Pukou Railway was quickly restored to traffic. Another example is the Baidu River Bridge on the Qiqihar-Bei'an line, where three piers were already tilted during liberation, one of which was particularly severe. The original general engineering personnel believed that the new bridge had to be rebuilt according to the experience of the Japanese invaders' rule. However, this would not only interrupt the busy transportation for two months, but also cost a large amount of engineering expenses. Therefore, the railway bureau adopted the Soviet experts' suggestion, and as a result, the pier was straightened, and the train passed over the bridge very smoothly.
    Another characteristic of the advanced technology and experience used by Soviet experts is that they are good at using machinery and rationally organizing operations, so that a small amount of manpower can exert a high degree of effectiveness. Among the railway line restoration projects in our country, bridge construction is of decisive significance. For example, the forty-two bridges between Hengyang and Guilin on the Xiang-Gui-Qian Railway were all destroyed by the explosion train specially organized by the Bai Chongxi bandit gang. The main bridges of the Guangdong-Hankou Railway were also destroyed by the Kuomintang bandit gangs. In the restoration of many bridges, the use of the light bridge erector designed by Soviet experts greatly increased the speed and saved manpower. When the soldiers got this bridge erector after repairing the Xinqiang River Bridge on the Guangdong-Hankou Railway, their enthusiasm was particularly high, and they went to work at five o'clock in the morning, and as a result, they erected five spans of beams in one day, while in the past they could only erect one span of beams in one day. There are many facts in various places that labor efficiency has been greatly improved due to the acceptance of Soviet experts' suggestions and scientific and rational organization of operation methods. The Zhengzhou Railway Bureau's overhaul of the line, from being able to replace three and a half kilometers of steel rails a day to more than fourteen kilometers a day, is one example.
    The characteristics of the technology and experience used by Soviet experts also lie in their ability to use a small amount or old materials to exert a large amount of effectiveness, thereby overcoming the difficulty of materials. When repairing a bridge on the Longhai Railway, Soviet experts saved 600 meters of I-beams according to Soviet precise calculation methods and prescribed standards. When repairing the bridges over the six major rivers such as the Shahe River and the Wukong River on the Baoding-Shijiazhuang section of the Beijing-Hankou Railway, the Railway Corps responsible for the project originally planned to blow up and rebuild many of the remaining piers in the river that had cracks. The Soviet experts suggested repairing them and continuing to use them, which saved a lot of time, as well as a lot of manpower and materials. In view of the lack of new steel beams, Soviet experts suggested replacing them with old steel beams reinforced by electric welding. When there was a shortage of wood, Soviet experts suggested joining short pieces of wood for use. Because the use of these new methods is not based on subjective wishes and enthusiasm, but on advanced technology and scientific and precise calculations, the results are very good after testing. It is precisely because of this that the past blind worship of American, British, and Japanese technology and the technologically conservative views among some old engineering personnel have begun to change, and in turn, they are humbly learning from the advanced experience of Soviet socialism. For example, the repair of a bridge on the Guangdong-Hankou Railway was carried out according to the Soviet experts' method of using I-beams. Our engineers were very worried that there would be danger. But after the twelve engineers saw the good results in the test run after the repair, they sincerely felt that the Soviet experts were indeed proficient in technology and worked harmoniously with the Soviet experts.
    The reason why Soviet advanced technology and experience can be appropriately applied to our country's railway work, thereby accelerating the recovery of our country's railway network, is because Soviet experts have excellent work style and internationalist spirit. Before making a suggestion or making an engineering plan, they must first conduct personal investigation and research and careful calculation. For example, for the Yellow River Railway Bridge on the Beijing-Hankou Railway, which was considered by general engineering personnel to be no longer usable because it had exceeded two warranty periods, Soviet experts went there for on-the-spot inspections and thorough tests. The results not only proved that the bridge could continue to be used, but also that the speed and traction of trains passing through the bridge could be greatly increased. Now, due to the preliminary reinforcement work, the speed of trains on the bridge has doubled, and the traction has also doubled. During the emergency repair of the Guangdong-Hankou Railway, it was the rainy season in the South, and almost the entire project was carried out in the rain. Soviet experts often went to the various sites to arrange work in the rain, often getting soaked and covered in mud without stopping work.
    Soviet experts attach great importance to encouraging and giving play to the enthusiasm of the staff. They often repeatedly explain the engineering plans they have drawn up to our country's engineering personnel, and if there are different opinions, they will hold meetings to discuss until the majority of people agree. They also often work with the workers. For example, during the repair of the most difficult project on the Guangdong-Hankou Railway, the Xinyanxia Bridge, they never left the site, and on the last day, they worked with the workers on the bridge all night. It is precisely because of this that Soviet advanced technology and experience have been combined with the broad masses of the working people, and have exerted unparalleled power.

　　感谢伟大友情的赠予
    ——我国铁路迅速恢复的钥匙
    自抗日战争爆发以来就不复存在的中国大陆的铁路网，已经以惊人的速度恢复起来了。如今，列车不分昼夜地吼叫着，自长白山奔向珠江，自东海滨驰向西北的高原，把我国广大的土地、城镇和乡村联结成浑然的整体。这是中国人民的积极劳动和苏联国际主义友谊的结晶。
    去年，正当美帝国主义支持国民党匪帮对我沿海进行封锁的时候，伟大的苏联却和我东北人民政府签订了贸易协定，七月协定才签字，九月就应我国的请求，运来了五百公里的钢轨。如果没有这五百公里的钢轨，贯通华北、华南的京汉路和粤汉路的迅速恢复通车是难以想像的。
    但是，钢轨固然可贵，而更可贵的却是伟大苏联赠予我国的迅速恢复铁路的钥匙。这把钥匙就是苏联第二次世界大战后迅速修复铁路的先进技术和经验。这些先进的技术和经验，由受我中央人民政府聘请的苏联铁路专家带到我国，和我国劳动人民的积极性、战斗性结合起来，创造了我国建设史上的光辉范例。比方说，接通粤汉、湘桂黔两大干线的湘江大桥，国民党匪帮曾经用了四年的时间都没有修好，这次我国铁路员工却在苏联专家的指导之下，只三十五天就全部完成。又比方说，对津浦路全线通车有决定作用的淮河大桥，也只六十天即告完成，而不是一般人所计划的半年到八个月的时间。这不是普通的建筑工程，而是和洪水赛跑。正因为只用了六十天，所以就跑到了洪水的前面，使新桥没有被建成后仅三天就暴涨的洪水冲毁。
    争取时间，完成了紧急而繁重的运输任务，这就是全国铁路网迅速恢复的重大意义。苏联专家是怎样来帮助我们赢得了时间的呢？这主要地在于他们掌握了先进的技术和经验。这种技术和经验的显著特点之一，是打破了过去美、英、日等资本主义国家建筑铁路中的旧规范和标准。如修淮河桥时，因恢复旧桥的工程很大，需时太多，苏联专家就运用苏德战争中修复第聂伯河桥的经验，建议另修一座临时桥。这个建议，当时曾在国内工程界人士中引起了疑虑，他们恐怕这会是一个极大的冒险。因为淮河北岸是无底细泥，南岸又是坚固岩石，不能打桩。但是，由于铁道部接受了苏联专家设计的木沉箱的办法，加上铁道兵团战士、干部以及潜水工、水手等，舍身地与淮水奋斗，结果大桥迅速落成，而津浦路也就迅速恢复通车。又如齐齐哈尔至北安的线路上的摆渡河桥，在解放时有三孔桥墩已经倾斜了，其中一孔倾斜得特别厉害。原有的一般工程人员按照日寇统治时期的经验，认为非改建新桥不可。但是，这样不仅得使繁忙的运输中断两月之久，而且得花费一笔很大的工程费用。于是路局采用了苏联专家的建议，结果桥墩被扶正了，列车过桥时非常平稳。
    苏联专家运用的先进技术和经验的另一特点，即在于他们善于使用机械和合理地组织作业，使少量的人力，发挥高度的效能。在我国铁路线恢复的工程之中，桥梁的修建工程是具有决定意义的。如湘桂黔铁路衡阳到桂林之间的四十二座桥梁就被白崇禧匪帮专门组织的爆炸列车通通破坏。粤汉路的主要桥梁也悉数被国民党匪帮所毁。在许多桥梁的修复工程中，因为采用了苏联专家设计的轻便架桥机，大大地提高了速度和节省了人力。在修复粤汉路的新墙河桥时，战士们得到了这种架桥机以后，情绪特别高涨，早晨五点多钟就上班，结果一天就架了五孔梁，而过去一天只能架一孔梁。由于接受苏联专家的建议，科学而合理地组织作业方法，使劳动效率大大提高的事实，在各地是很多的。郑州铁路局整修线路中，由一天可换三公里半钢轨提高到一天换十四公里以上，就是其中的一个例子。
    苏联专家运用的技术和经验的特点，还在于善于使用少量或残旧的材料，发挥大量的效能，从而克服材料的困难。在修陇海路某座桥梁时，苏联专家按照苏联的精密计算方法和规定的标准，节省了工字铁六百公尺。在修京汉路保石段上沙河、悟空河等六大河流的桥梁时，对于河里残留的许多有了裂痕的桥墩，负责工程的铁道兵团原拟炸毁重建，苏联专家却建议加以修补，继续使用，结果省了许多时间，还省了很多人力和材料。鉴于新钢梁缺乏，苏联专家就建议把旧钢梁用电焊加固来代替。当缺乏木料的时候，苏联专家就建议把短木材接起来使用。由于这些新方法的使用不是凭借于主观的愿望和热情，而是凭借于先进技术，和科学的精密的计算，所以经过检验，结果都很良好。也正因如此，某些旧工程人员中过去对于美、英、日技术盲目崇拜的思想，以及技术上保守主义的观点，已经开始起了转变，而反过来虚心地向苏联社会主义的先进经验学习。如粤汉路上某座桥梁的修复，是按照苏联专家的方法来使用工字铁的，我国工程师很耽心会出危险。但当十二位工程师在修复后的试车中看到了良好的效果以后，就由衷地感觉苏联专家的确精通技术，并融洽地和苏联专家一起工作。
    苏联先进技术和经验之所以能够恰当地运用于我国铁道工作中，从而加速了我国铁路网的恢复，是由于苏联专家们具有优良的工作作风和国际主义的精神。他们在提出一个建议或作一个工程计划以前，必先经过亲身的调查研究和精细计算。如对于因超过了两个保固期限而被一般工程人员认为不能再继续使用的京汉路黄河铁桥，苏联专家到那里去作实地勘察和周密试验。结果不仅证明该桥仍能继续使用，而且列车通过该铁桥时的行驶速度和牵引力还可大为提高。现在由于进行了初步加固工作，桥上列车的行驶速度已提高了两倍，牵引力亦提高了一倍。在粤汉路的抢修期间，正值南方雨季，整个工程几乎全部在雨中进行。苏联专家们经常到各现场冒雨布置工作，往往弄得全身湿透、污泥满身也不终止工作。
    苏联专家非常重视鼓励和发挥工作人员的积极性。他们经常把自己订的工程计划向我国工程人员反复讲解说明，如果有不同意见就开会讨论，直到取得多数人的同意为止。他们并且经常和工人们在一起工作。如在修复粤汉路最艰巨的工程——新岩下大桥时，他们始终未离开现场，最后一天竟和工人们在桥上工作了一整夜。正因为如此，苏联的先进技术和经验就和我国广大劳动群众结合起来，发出了无比的威力。
