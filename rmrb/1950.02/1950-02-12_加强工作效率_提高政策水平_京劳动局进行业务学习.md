Clear instructions were also given on the specific tasks of the Labor Bureau in mediating labor-capital disputes, reviewing and approving collective contracts, and providing relief to unemployed workers who will be laid off in the future. After the meeting, all cadres combined the examples and problems encountered in implementing the policy and launched a heated discussion and inspection.
