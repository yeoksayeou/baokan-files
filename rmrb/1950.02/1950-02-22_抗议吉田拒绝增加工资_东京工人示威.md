　　Protesting Yoshida's Refusal to Increase Wages
    Tokyo Workers Demonstrate
    Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, February 21st: Tokyo dispatch: 30,000 Japanese workers held a large-scale mass demonstration in the Imperial Palace Plaza in Tokyo for eight hours, protesting the Yoshida government's rejection of the government employees' union's demand for wage increases. This mass rally was presided over by the Joint Struggle Committee of Trade Unions. Union representatives, in their speeches at the rally, demanded the overthrow of the dictatorial Yoshida government. Prior to this, the thirty-five trade unions participating in the Joint Struggle Committee, in protest against the Yoshida government's refusal to increase workers' wages, decided on February 6th to hold a general strike on the 23rd, but this general strike plan was declared illegal by MacArthur on the 15th and was prohibited.
    According to a Tokyo dispatch from Dentsu News Agency: The thirty-five trade unions participating in the Joint Struggle Committee, including a number of government workers' unions, are mostly controlled by right-wing elements of the so-called "Democratization League." These individuals, with the help of the Japanese government and the United States, split the unions last summer and forced out left-wing union leaders. Under pressure from the rank-and-file membership, the right-wing leadership has been organizing a movement to demand wage increases for government workers with excessively low incomes since last winter.

　　抗议吉田拒绝增加工资
    东京工人示威
    【新华社北京二十一日电】东京消息：日本三万工人八十日在东京皇宫广场上举行了大规模的群众示威大会，抗议吉田政府拒绝政府机关职工工会关于增加工资的要求。这次群众大会是由工会联合斗争委员会主持的。工会代表在大会上演说时，要求打倒独裁的吉田政府。在此以前，参加联合斗争委员会的三十五个工会，为了抗议吉田政府拒绝工人增加工资的要求，曾于二月六日决定于二十三日举行总罢工，但这一总罢工计划，被麦克阿瑟于十五日宣布为非法，遭到禁止。
    据电通社东京消息：参加联合斗争委员会的三十五个工会，包括若干政府工人工会，大部是被所谓“民主化同盟”的右翼分子所控制。这些人去年夏天在日本政府与美国的帮助下，分裂工会，迫走了左翼职工领袖。在会员群众的压力之下，右翼领导机构不得不自去年冬天起，就为收入过低的政府工人组织了要求增加工资的运动。
