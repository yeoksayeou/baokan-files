　　The Supply Cooperative of the Hebei Military Region
    The Supply Department of the Hebei Military Region, adhering to the principle of serving the soldiers, established a supply cooperative that has been well-received by the soldiers. Every Saturday and Sunday, especially after the stipends are issued, the crowds of people buying things are so large that they are overwhelmed. From its opening on October 1st of last year to the end of December, in the three months, with prices averaging 7.3% lower than market prices, it sold subsidiary foods and daily necessities such as salt, alkali, sesame oil, white oil, and white and red sugar, totaling over 526,170,000 yuan in value. By reducing intermediate exploitation, the troops saved over 43,418,000 yuan. Under the conditions of preserving capital in kind without dividends, and a 2% discount on purchases, it absorbed 567,350 yuan in private shares (currently exceeding 1,000,000 yuan).
    The reasons for the success of the troop supply cooperative are summarized as follows:
    (1) Clearly defining the principle of serving the soldiers: Breaking the profit-seeking mindset and stipulating that the price of all goods must be lower than the market price. Only military personnel are allowed to buy things, and sales to people outside the military are prohibited, as is buying on behalf of outsiders (except for family members introduced by the company). For collective purchases of study supplies, if they temporarily lack money, they can buy on credit as long as the company guarantees payment within a month. However, the entire company's purchase must be made with a purchase certificate and is limited to one month's worth. As for private shareholding, it is stipulated that the minimum is 1,000 yuan, converted to the price of rice to preserve capital in kind, with no dividends, but shareholders can receive preferential treatment when buying goods, which is 2% cheaper than for ordinary people.
    (2) Direct connection between production and sales: People are sent directly to the factories that produce the finished products to purchase, or to make long-distance purchases, in order to avoid or reduce the exploitation of merchants and allow the goods to be sold at prices lower than the market price. Close contact is also maintained with state-owned and private stores to understand market trends and master market prices.
    (3) The goods are mainly subsidiary foods, with some daily necessities needed by the offices and soldiers also prepared. Avoiding the purchase of unpopular goods that the troops do not need, as this will tie up capital and make it difficult to operate.
    (4) Democratic management: Because the leadership lacks experience, it is necessary to give full play to everyone's initiative, scientifically divide labor, and establish various systems. Cadres should be streamlined to reduce redundancy. Close contact is also maintained with the soldiers and offices, and their opinions are frequently solicited to improve work.

### 河北军区的部队供应合作社

　　河北军区的部队供应合作社
    河北军区供给部本着为兵服务的方针，建立部队供应社，很受战士们的欢迎。每逢星期六和星期日，特别是刚发下津贴费以后，买东西的人很拥挤，有应接不暇之势。自去年十月一日开张到十二月底，三个月中在平均低于物价百分之七·三的价格下，共销售食盐、碱面、香油、白油、红白糖等副食品及日用品，总价值五亿二千六百一十七万余元。由于减少了中间剥削，使部队节省了四千三百四十一万八千余元。并在实物保本不分红，购货优待百分之二的条件下，吸收了私人股金五十六万七千三百五十元（目前已超过一百万元）。
    总结部队供应社办得好的原因有：
    （一）明确为兵服务的方针：打破盈利观点，规定一切货物的价格都要低于市价。只许部队人员买东西，不卖部队以外的人，也不许部队替外人买（家属经过连队介绍的例外）。集体购买学习用品，暂时没钱的，只要连部保证一个月内给钱，就能赊给。但全连购货要持购物证，且只准买一个月的。至于私人入股，则规定以一千元起码，合成米价实物保本，不再分红，购货时可以受到优待，比一般人便宜百分之二。
    （二）产销直接联系：派人到生产成品的厂坊直接购买或远方采购，以避免或减少商人的剥削，使货物能低于市价售出。并与国营、私营商店密切联系，了解行情，掌握市价。
    （三）货物是以副食品为主，另外准备一些机关和战士所需要的日常用品。避免采购不合部队需要的冷货，那样会积压资本，不易活动。
    （四）民主管理：因为领导上缺乏经验，必须发挥大家的积极性，科学分工，建立各种制度。干部力求精悍，减少冗员。并与战士与机关密切联系，经常征求他们的意见，改进工作。
