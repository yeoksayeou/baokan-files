　　Strengthening the Adjustment of Materials in Various Regions, Last Month's Transactions Exceeded 20 Billion
　　[Report from this newspaper] In order to meet the requirements of cooperatives in various regions, the North China Cooperative Goods Depot is currently focusing on strengthening the adjustment of materials in various regions, so as to open up sales channels for local products and develop export trade. In January, the depot promoted the sale of more than 170,000 catties of dried persimmons, more than 100,000 catties of red dates, and more than 24,000 catties of Chinese prickly ash to the Northeast, exchanging them for a large amount of coarse grains to support disaster areas. The depot also helped Tangshan Workers' Cooperative to transport and sell more than 100,300 tons of coal that had been backlogged in Shanghai. In addition, it promoted the sale of more than 270,000 catties of smoked dates to Shanghai, exchanging them for 120,000 bundles of foreign yarn and more than 3,500 bolts of cloth for the needs of cooperative members. In order to help agricultural production, the depot recently advanced the purchase of more than 33,000 catties of red alum (arsenic sulfide) for various cooperatives for pest control, and combined with the cooperatives to purchase 1.5 million catties of peanuts from farmers, which were transported to Tianjin for processing and finding sales channels. The total transaction volume of the depot in January reached more than 21 billion yuan, with agency operations and self-operated operations each accounting for half. Due to the development of the depot's business, not only did the agricultural products transported to Tianjin by cooperatives in various regions get convenient sales, but also more than 130 cooperative cadres stationed in Tianjin were organized to purchase and sell in a unified, planned, and step-by-step manner, in coordination with market management.

　　加强调剂各区物资  上月成交二百余亿
    【本报讯】华北合作货栈为适应各地合作社要求，目前正有重点地加强调剂各区物资，以打开土产销路，开展出口贸易。在一月份内该栈曾向东北推销柿饼十七万余斤，红枣十万余斤，花椒二万四千余斤，换回大量粗粮支援灾区；唐山职工社所积压之煤十万零三百余吨，该栈亦代其运沪销售，另外并向上海推销薰枣二十七万余斤，换回洋纱十二万余捆，布三千五百多匹供给社员需用。为帮助农业生产，该栈近提前给各社代买红矾（信石）三万三千余斤，作为杀虫之用，并结合合作社收购农民一百五十万斤花生，运津加工，代找销路。总计该栈一月份交易总额达二百十余亿元，代营与自营各占一半。由于该栈业务开展，不但使各地合作社运津的农业品，得到了销售的便利；并使各地驻津的合作社干部一百三十余人组织了起来，有计划有步骤地统一购销，配合市场管理。
