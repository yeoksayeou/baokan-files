　　Remembering the Martyrs Who Died at the "White Mansion" in Chongqing
Xinhua News Agency dispatch: After more than a month of investigation, it has been learned that the actual number of martyrs who died in the "Sino-American Cooperation Organization" concentration camp in Chongqing was 203. Among them, 92 were Communist Party members, 17 were members of the Democratic League, and the rest were members of other democratic parties, revolutionary groups, and non-party人士. In terms of the martyrs' origin, 24 were from Sichuan, and others were from Yunnan, Guizhou, Xikang, Guangxi, Shaanxi, Henan, Hebei, Shandong, Hubei, Hunan, Jiangxi, Anhui, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Liaoning, Shanghai, Beijing, Tianjin, as well as Mongolia and overseas Chinese from Southeast Asia. In terms of the martyrs' occupations before their deaths, there were professional revolutionaries, revolutionary soldiers, workers, farmers, students, professors, teachers, journalists, scientists, and businessmen. In terms of gender, there were 16 women. In terms of age, there were elders of 59 years old and infants of nine months old. The martyrs' perseverance in struggle and hard study in prison, as well as the high degree of integrity of the Chinese people demonstrated when they died, are moving and praiseworthy. Communist Party member Liu Guozhi, originally a student in the Department of Economics at Southwest Associated University, was one of the leaders of the student movement. Before he was murdered on the dusk of November 27 last year, he gave a speech to the secret agent bandits for up to 20 minutes with a high head, explaining that revolution will surely win and reaction will surely fail, and singing the national anthem and shouting "Long live the Communist Party of China!" "Long live Mao Zedong!" until his last breath. The secret agents hated him so much that they used the most brutal torture on him. Communist Party member Tan Chenming pointed at the secret agents and scolded, "We will die first, but the People's Liberation Army is about to attack. Let's see how many days you can be rampant!" He and Xu Xiaoxuan had been arrested for ten years. They studied hard in prison and were very proficient in English and Russian, writing a lot in foreign languages. Communist Party member Chen Ran was originally the editor and distributor of the underground mimeographed newspaper "Forward Daily" in Chongqing. In prison, he used bamboo sticks as pens to start the "Forward Daily White House Edition" (White House refers to the White Mansion where they were imprisoned), which was spread among the inmates and played a great role in strengthening their determination to fight. Female Communist Party member Jiang Zhuyun was unmoved by the cruel torture. The inmates wrote a poem to her: "You are the soul of Sophia, you are the incarnation of Danniang, no, you are you, you are the epitome of Chinese sons and daughters." It is worth mentioning that there are many non-Party revolutionaries, such as Xuan Hao, who was arrested in the Anhui Incident. He secretly read books every night in prison by chiseling a hole in the wall to let light in, practiced writing, and took care of his inmates meticulously. He faced death without changing his expression and died heroically. A few days before his death, he wrote a farewell letter to a friend, regretting that he could not use his personal experience to expose the secret agent's shady secrets. Every word was filled with blood and tears. Recently, it was exhibited at an exhibition, and all those who read it were moved.

　　记殉难于重庆“白公馆”的烈士们
    经月余调查，得悉殉难于重庆“中美合作所”集中营内的烈士实数为二百零三名。其中共产党员占九十二人，民盟盟员十七人，其他民主党派、革命团体及无党派人士一部。以烈士籍贯论，四川二十四人，其他云、贵、康、桂、陕、豫、冀、鲁、鄂、湘、赣、皖、苏、浙、辽、沪、京、津、及蒙古、南洋华侨均有。以烈士生前职业论，有职业革命家、革命军人、工人、农民、学生、教授、教员、新闻记者、科学家、商人等。以性别论，有女性十六人。以年龄论，有五十九岁的老者，也有九个月的幼童。烈士们在狱中坚持斗争和努力学习及殉难时所表现的中国人民的高度气节，其事迹可歌可泣。共产党员刘国鋕，原系西南联大经济系学生，为学生运动领袖之一。他于去年十一月二十七日黄昏被害前，以昂然阔步向特务匪徒演讲达二十分钟，说明革命必胜，反动必败，并高唱国歌、高呼“中国共产党万岁！”“毛泽东万岁！”直到最后一息。特务对他恨极，用刑最惨。共产党员谭沉明指着特务骂道：“老子们死在前，但解放军就要打来了，看你们还能猖狂几天！”他和许晓轩均已被捕十年，在狱中努力学习，英文俄文均甚熟习，外国文写作甚多。共产党员陈然原系重庆地下油印报《挺进报》的编辑和发行人，他在狱中以竹签作笔，创办《挺进报白宫版》（白宫指囚禁处是白公馆），在难友中传播，对坚定斗争决心有极大作用。女共产党员江竹筠受酷型亦毫无所动，难友们作了一首诗赠她：“你是索菲亚的灵魂，你是丹娘化身，不，你就是你，你是中华儿女的典型。”值得提起的还有许多非党革命家，如皖南事变被捕的宣灏，在狱中凿壁偷光每夜读书，练习写作，并照顾难友，无微不至，死难时面不改色，从容就义。死难前数日，他给友人写一绝命书，以不能用亲身经历暴露特务黑幕为憾。字字血泪，最近在展览会展出，阅者无不动容。
