　　Xinhua News Agency, Prague, 18th. The Communist Information Bureau's organ, "For Lasting Peace, For People's Democracy," which has just been published in Bucharest, featured the full text of the Sino-Soviet Treaty and its related agreements on the front page. It also reprinted the Soviet Pravda's three-column editorial, "Long Live Sino-Soviet Friendship."
    Romanian newspapers and public opinion have praised the Sino-Soviet alliance as one of the most significant events in recent times, pointing out that this alliance greatly consolidates the world peace camp and greatly encourages freedom fighters everywhere to fight against the warmongering Anglo-Americans.
    The Bulgarian Communist Party's organ, "Workers' Cause," stated in its editorial that the Sino-Soviet treaty is a brilliant proof of Stalin's peaceful diplomacy, a head-on blow to the American imperialists, and a resounding answer to Acheson's shameless declarations attempting to condemn Soviet aggression against China and the Mongolian People's Republic.
    Xinhua News Agency, Prague, 17th. The publication of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance and the two agreements has aroused warm welcome from newspapers in European People's Democratic countries and progressive newspapers in Western Europe. Prague's Red Right Newspaper, Labor Newspaper, People's Newspaper, and Youth Front Newspaper all published the full text of the treaty and agreements on the front page in prominent positions on the 16th. The Red Right Newspaper also wrote an editorial entitled "A Historical Milestone Towards Peace." The Hungarian Workers' Party's organ, "Free People's Newspaper" in Budapest, published the full text of the treaty and agreements on the front page and most of the second page on the 16th. Warsaw's People's Tribune, Bucharest's Spark Newspaper, Sofia's Labor Newspaper, Rome's Unity Newspaper, and Copenhagen's Land and People's Newspaper all published articles and commentaries in addition to news reports. Paris's "L'Humanité" published the full text of the treaty and agreements, as well as the speeches by Foreign Minister Vyshinsky and Premier and Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai, under the headline "Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance is a Decisive Contribution to Enhancing Peace" on the front page and most of the third page (international edition). The front page of "L'Humanité" also published an editorial entitled "A Historic Action." The "Ce Soir" newspaper published the content of the treaty and agreements under the banner headline "Sino-Soviet Thirty-Year Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance Signed in Moscow" and a commentary signed by the newspaper's international news editor, George Soria. London's "Daily Worker" excerpted the contents of the treaty on the right column of the front page on the 16th under the headline "Welcome to the Historically Significant Treaty Signed Between the Soviet Union and China," and wrote an editorial entitled "The Star of the East."
