　　Xikang Tibetan Representatives Arrive in Beijing
    Vice Chairman Zhu De Received Them Yesterday
    They Presented a Banner to Chairman Peng Dehuai in Xi'an
    【Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, February 26th】Wang Jia, Bo Zhi, Cai Liang and other three Tibetan representatives from Xikang arrived in Beijing on the 19th to pay respects to the leaders of the Central People's Government. Vice Chairman Zhu De of the Central People's Government received them at 4 pm this afternoon. Secretary-General Lin Boqu of the Central People's Government and Vice Chairman Liu Geping of the Nationalities Affairs Commission were also present. Wang Jia and others presented a joint letter of respect from patriotic Tibetan figures in Xikang, including Gelda Living Buddha, Xiake Daodeng, Bangda Duoji, and Zhang Xilangjie, to Vice Chairman Zhu, and expressed the Tibetan compatriots' ardent hope for a swift liberation. Vice Chairman Zhu welcomed them to Beijing and expressed his hope that the Tibetan people would unanimously assist the People's Liberation Army in road construction, grain transportation, and overcoming all difficulties in order to quickly liberate all Tibetan compatriots. Wang Jia and others stated that after returning to Xikang, they would definitely mobilize the Tibetan people to fully support the People's Liberation Army, prepare to restore and develop production, and build a new life for the Tibetan compatriots under the leadership of the People's Government.
    【Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, February 26th】Wang Jia, Bo Zhi, and Cai Liang, three Tibetan representatives from Xikang, are traveling to Beijing to pay respects to the leaders of the Central People's Government. When the three representatives passed through Xi'an, they presented a banner to Chairman Peng Dehuai of the Northwest Military and Political Committee on the afternoon of the 16th to pay their respects. The banner presentation ceremony was filled with a solemn and united atmosphere. Chairman Peng Dehuai personally accepted the red brocade banner inscribed with "Savior of the Border People." Representative Wang Jia recited a tribute that fully expressed the Tibetan people's love and respect for Chairman Mao and warmly expressed their willingness to consolidate the unity of all nationalities under the leadership of the great and brilliant Chairman Mao and to strive for the construction of an independent, free, equal, unified, prosperous, and happy New China. Chairman Peng delivered a reply, first praising the glorious history of the Tibetan compatriots' long struggle against oppression. He pointed out that in 1950, the Chinese People's Liberation Army would completely liberate Tibet, which meant the complete liberation of the Tibetan people. Chairman Peng then elaborated on the People's Government's ethnic policy and used the fact that Xi Rao Jia Cuo, a member of the Northwest Military and Political Committee and Vice Chairman of the Qinghai Provincial People's Government, participated in the people's democratic political power structure to illustrate that this policy was being implemented in concrete terms. Finally, Chairman Peng recalled the situation when the Workers' and Peasants' Red Army passed through the Tibetan areas in northern Xikang during the Long March northward and especially thanked the Tibetan people on behalf of the Chinese People's Liberation Army for their various assistance to the People's Liberation Army at that time. The ceremony ended with Chairman Peng shouting the slogans "Long live the liberation of the Tibetan people" and "Long live the unity, friendship, and harmony of all nationalities in China." Chairman Peng then hosted a banquet. The three representatives took a car to Beijing at 4:30 pm on the 17th. As early as 1934, when the Chinese Workers' and Peasants' Red Army carried out the 25,000-li Long March and passed through a certain area in Xikang, Commander-in-Chief Zhu personally helped the local Tibetan people organize the Boba (i.e., Tibetan, "Boba" is a transliteration of the Tibetan language) government. For the past sixteen years, the Tibetan people in the area have been constantly fighting against the enemy. When Lanzhou and Xining were liberated last year, the Boba government, together with respected democratic figures among the Tibetan people, held a secret meeting and decided to send representatives to Beijing to request the People's Liberation Army to help liberate the Tibetan people. When they set off, Sichuan and Xikang had not yet been liberated, and they came through the blockade line.

    【新华社西安二十六日电】西康藏民代表汪嘉、伯志、蔡良三人赴京晋谒中央人民政府首长致敬。三代表路过西安时，曾于十六日下午向西北军政委员会彭德怀主席献旗致敬。献旗仪式充满庄严和团结气氛。彭德怀主席亲自接受上书“边民救星”的红色锦旗。汪嘉代表诵读充分表现藏民敬爱毛主席的献词，并热烈表示愿在伟大英明的毛主席领导下，巩固各民族团结，为建设独立、自由、平等、统一、富强与康乐的新中国而奋斗。彭主席致答词，首先赞扬藏族同胞悠长的反压迫斗争的光荣历史。并指出：一九五○年中国人民解放军要全部解放西藏，也就是全部解放藏胞。彭主席接着阐述人民政府的民族政策，并以西北军政委员会委员、青海省人民政府副主席喜饶嘉错参加人民民主政权机构的事实，说明这个政策正在具体实施。最后，彭主席回忆起工农红军长征北上路过西康北部藏民区时的情形，特代表中国人民解放军感谢藏族人民当时对于人民解放军的各种帮助。仪式在彭主席高呼“藏族解放万岁”，“中国所有各民族团结友爱和睦万岁”的口号声中结束。继由彭主席设宴招待。三代表于十七日下午四时半乘车赴京。按远在一九三四年中国工农红军举行二万五千里长征，路经西康某地时，朱总司令曾亲自帮助当地藏民，组织博巴（即藏族，“博巴”是藏语的译音）政府。十六年来该地藏族人民不断地和敌人斗争。当去年兰州、西宁相继解放后，博巴政府就联合藏民中有声望的民主人士举行秘密会议，决定派代表赴京请求人民解放军帮助解放藏族人民。当他们动身时，四川、西康还没有解放，他们是冲过封锁线前来的。
