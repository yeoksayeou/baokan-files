　　郑二届各界人民代表会议
    执行代表大会职权
    宋致和当选为郑州市长
    【新华社开封二十四日电】代行人民代表大会职权的郑州市第二届各界人民代表会议，于本月四日至八日举行。会议以无记名投票方式，选出宋致和为市长，赵武成、刘道安等十七人为市人民政府委员会委员，并选出赵武成、李元放等二十七人为第二届各界人民代表会议协商委员会委员，宋致和、刘道安等十二人为出席河南省首届各界人民代表会议代表。由于郑州市解放十五个月以来，各界人民在自己的政府领导下，不仅建立了革命秩序、镇压了反革命活动，并且已经逐步地组织起来，因此，由各界代表会议协商委员会议决定，经呈请河南省人民政府批准，此次会议代行人民代表大会的职权。依据中央人民政府关于市各界人民代表会议组织通则之规定，并因为市区扩大，此次会议之代表全部经过改选，代表名额由以前之一八零名增为二二零名。
