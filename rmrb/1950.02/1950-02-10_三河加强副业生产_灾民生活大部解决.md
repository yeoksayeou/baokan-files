　　Sanhe Strengthens Sideline Production: Most Disaster Victims' Livelihoods Resolved
    [Our Dispatch] The peasants in the disaster area of Sanhe County, Hebei Province, have worked hard to engage in sideline production, and the livelihood difficulties of the disaster victims in most villages have been resolved. In the third and fourth districts of Sanhe County, there are 57 severely affected villages with more than 30,000 disaster victims. According to the county's instructions, the two districts convened a meeting of peasant representatives in early December of last year. At the meeting, in response to the disaster situation at the time, they conscientiously studied ways to overcome the famine through production, and decided to vigorously develop mass participation in supply and marketing cooperatives, and carry out business with the principles of "small profits and quick turnover" and "mutual assistance and mutual borrowing." After mobilization, most of the various sideline productions in the two districts have been restored. For example, in Yangxinzhuang, the third district, 110 households with more than 400 people have started eight kinds of production, which can maintain the lives of 400 people. This enables 30 households of disaster victims who previously relied on begging to become self-sufficient. Some households can even save three to five dou of grain. The fourth district has achieved even greater results, having restored more than 500 looms, which can solve the livelihoods of 4,000 people; and restored more than 1,300 spinning wheels, which can sustain 1,500 people. In the transportation and sales industry, more than 1,000 wheelbarrows have been restored, sustaining the lives of 2,000 people. In addition, sideline productions such as fish farming and tofu making can solve the livelihoods of 10,000 people, greatly increasing the masses' confidence in self-reliance through production. According to statistics from eleven villages in the fourth district, 84 households, totaling 403 disaster victims, who had gone out to flee the famine and beg for food last year have returned home to participate in production. Currently, the supply and marketing branch of the fourth district has nearly 1,000 members. The supply and marketing cooperative has collected more than 8,000 bolts of cloth in exchange for more than 97,000 jin of seed cotton. It has also lent more than 1,600 jin of cotton to the families of revolutionary martyrs, soldiers, and workers, as well as widows and widowers in 21 villages, mobilizing nearly 600 spinning wheels to spin thread. To sum up the situation in the villages of the third and fourth districts of Sanhe County, most of the disaster victims have solved their livelihood difficulties through hard work in sideline production.

　　三河加强副业生产  灾民生活大部解决
    【本报讯】河北三河县灾区农民努力从事副业生产，大部村庄灾民生活困难已得解决。三河县三、四两区，共有重灾村五十七个，灾民三万余人。两区按县的指示，于去年十二月初，召开了农民代表会。会上针对当时灾情，认真研究生产渡荒办法，决定大力发展群众参加供销社，并用“薄利广销”，“互助互借”方针开展业务。经过动员，两区各种副业生产大部恢复。如三区杨辛庄一百十户共四百余人，搞起八种生产，能维持四百人的生活。使以前靠要饭吃的三十户灾民都能自给。有的户还能存下三、五斗粮。四区成绩更大，已恢复起织布机五百多架，能解决四千人的生活；又恢复纺车一千三百余架，可维持一千五百人生活。运销业中，恢复小推车一千多辆，维持了两千人的生活。再加上治鱼、制豆腐等副业生产，共能解决一万人生活，大大提高群众生产自救的信心。据四区十一个村统计，去年出外逃荒要饭的灾民已有八十四户，共计四百零三人回家参加生产。现四区供销分社拥有社员近一千人。供销社已收布八千多匹，换出籽棉九万七千多斤。又以棉花一千六百多斤贷给二十一个村的烈、军、工属及鳏、寡户，发动近六百辆纺车纺线。总结三河县三、四两区各村庄，大部灾民已从努力副业生产中解决了生活困难。
