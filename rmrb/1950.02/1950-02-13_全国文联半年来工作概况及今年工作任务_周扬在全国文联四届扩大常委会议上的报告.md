Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, February 12th:

　　Zhou Yang, Vice Chairman of the All-China Federation of Literary and Art Circles, reported on the overview of the National Federation of Literary and Art Circles' work in the past six months and the work tasks for 1950 at the Fourth Enlarged Standing Committee Meeting of the Federation. The main points are as follows:

    Since the closing of the All-China Congress of Literary and Art Workers last July, approximately forty localities across the country have convened congresses of literary and art workers or meetings of literary and art workers, and have established local federations of literary and art circles or their preparatory organizations.

    The literary and art congresses convened in various localities have extensively united figures from all aspects of the literary and art circles. These meetings have all pointed out that literature and art should serve the Liberation War and production construction, and that literary and artistic creation should reflect the face of the new China, the face of new undertakings and new people, as well as the typical examples of new heroism among the people. These meetings demanded that literary and artistic work in various localities continue to implement the principle of putting popularization first, vigorously reform old operas and other various old folk arts, and develop amateur literary and artistic activities among workers, peasants, and soldiers.

    In the military, the literary and art movement has also made good progress. The Fourth Field Army established an army-wide Literary and Art Work Committee, and issued the "Decision on Strengthening Literary and Art Work in the Army," proposing to launch a creative movement throughout the army; the Third Field Army held a literary and art work meeting, introducing and summarizing the experience of literary and art work in companies, and conducted an award ceremony for literary and artistic works of the troops.

    In terms of literary and artistic publications, in the second half of 1949, forty kinds of publications such as "Literary and Art News," "People's Literature," and "People's Fine Arts," and one hundred and ninety-seven kinds of literary and artistic books were published. The quantity of literary and artistic publications, according to the current state of national economic recovery and cultural recovery, is already more than enough. The important issue in the future should be to improve quality, so that the manpower and resources we use in this area are truly beneficial to the people, beneficial to the war and production, and avoid waste.

    Due to the special emphasis on the importance of uniting old artists and reforming old operas at the National Cultural Congress, this work has been vigorously carried out throughout the country after the meeting. Major cities across the country have established mass organizations such as opera improvement associations to promote opera reform. In writing and revising scripts, the Northeast adopted a mass line of working closely with old artists, not only adapting and creating more than two hundred new operas, but also educating thousands of old artists and laying a good foundation. In the second half of 1949, many new programs were performed in the opera circles of Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, Wuhan, and other places. Tianjin performed a total of eighty-six new programs, two thousand three hundred and thirty-five shows, with an estimated audience of over one million eight hundred thousand people. Wuhan performed fourteen new dramas in four forms: Chu opera, Han opera, Beijing opera, and Ping opera, totaling one hundred and eighty shows, with an audience of approximately two hundred and thirty thousand people. In opera reform, local operas and folk arts were more active. The Ping opera "Nine-Tailed Fox" was performed continuously for sixty-nine shows in Beijing, breaking the record for new programs in Beijing. New folk arts have already gained an important position in many amusement parks. The necessity and possibility of Beijing opera reform have been widely recognized by Beijing opera actors and audiences. Beijing, Shanghai, Nanjing, Tianjin, and other places have held short-term or amateur training classes for old artists, which have achieved great results. Experience has proven that the cause of opera reform must mainly rely on the broad masses of old artists to rise up consciously, actively, and collectively to carry it out in order to succeed.

    The work tasks of the National Federation of Literary and Art Circles in 1950 are to cooperate with the general tasks of national construction, mobilize and organize all forces in the literary and art circles to promote the popularization and improvement of literature and art, and prepare conditions for the coming high tide of cultural construction. Among these, the most important are to promote creation and criticism, so that the ideological and artistic level of literary and artistic works can be improved one step from the existing foundation, and to closely connect with local literary and artistic organizations, so that the activities of the Federation have a mass character. To this end, the work that the Federation should do in 1950 includes:

    1. Promote and organize literary and art workers to go to factories, rural areas, and troops to help them complete the tasks of literary and artistic creation.

    2. Prepare to establish a literary research institute, recruit a certain number of literary and artistic youths with practical work experience and considerable writing ability, train them, and improve their writing skills.

    3. Establish criticism groups to conduct regular research and discussion on works, and systematically and plannedly organize and publish critical articles to overcome the current state of lack of criticism or weak criticism in literature and art.

    4. Enrich the content of publications such as "Literary and Art News" and "People's Literature," further strengthen their connection with the masses, and strengthen their educational role for the masses and specific help for beginners in writing.

    5. Systematically understand the situation of literary and artistic work in various localities and troops, collect materials, and establish regular communication relationships.

    6. Hold a National Federation of Literary and Art Circles work conference once, combined with the National Committee meeting. The main tasks of the meeting are to understand the situation, exchange experiences, and solve the problem of the correct relationship between improvement and popularization nationwide.

    7. Convene several temporary reporting meetings as needed.

    8. Continue to promote the establishment of opera improvement organizations in various localities, in order to unite the broad masses of old artists and automatically and actively carry out the work of opera reform.

　　全国文联半年来工作概况及今年工作任务
    ——周扬在全国文联四届扩大常委会议上的报告
    【新华社北京十二日电】中华全国文学艺术界联合会副主席周扬在该会第四次扩大常务委员会会议上报告了全国文联半年来工作概况及一九五○年工作任务。要点如下：
    自去年七月中华全国文学艺术工作者代表大会闭幕后，全国已有约四十个地方召开了文艺工作者代表大会或文艺工作者会议，成立了地方性的文学艺术界联合会或其筹备机构。
    各地所召开的文代大会，都广泛地团结了文艺界的各方面人物。这些会议都指出了文艺应为解放战争和生产建设服务，文艺创作应表现新中国的面貌，新的事业与新的人物的面貌，以及人民中的新的英雄主义的典型。这些会议要求各地文艺工作继续贯彻普及第一的方针，大力改革旧戏曲及其他各种民间旧艺术，并开展工农兵群众业余的文艺活动。
    在部队方面，文艺运动也有良好的进展。第四野战军成立了全军文艺工作委员会，发布了“加强部队文艺工作的决定”，提出在全军开展创作运动；第三野战军举行了文艺工作会议，介绍和总结了连队文艺工作的经验，并进行了部队文艺作品的评奖工作。
    在文艺出版物方面，一九四九年下半年出版了《文艺报》、《人民文学》、《人民美术》等四十种刊物，一百九十七种文艺书籍。文艺出版物的量，按照目前国家经济恢复和文化恢复后的状况来说，已经是只多不少了，今后的重要问题，应当是提高质量，使我们用于这一方面的人力物力确实有益于人民，有益于战争和生产，而避免浪费。
    由于全国文化大会上特别强调了团结旧艺人与改革旧戏曲的重要，会后，这一工作曾在全国各地蓬勃展开。全国各大城市成立了戏曲改进协会等推进戏曲改革的群众组织。在编写修改剧本上，东北采取了与旧艺人通力合作的群众路线，不仅改编和创作了两百个以上的新戏曲，而且教育了成千的旧艺人，打下了较好基础。一九四九年下半年中，京、津、沪、汉等地，戏曲界都演出了不少新的节目。天津共演出新节目八十六种，二三三五场，估计观众在一百八十万人以上。武汉演出楚戏、汉戏、京戏、评戏四种形式的新剧十四种，计一百八十场，观众约二十三万人。在戏曲改革中，以地方戏与曲艺较为活跃，北京演出评戏《九尾狐》，曾连续六十九场，打破了京市演新节目的纪录。新曲艺在许多游艺场已有了重要的地位。京戏改革的必要和可能，已经被京剧的演员和观众所广泛地承认。北京、上海、南京、天津等地都为旧艺人举办了短期的或业余的讲习班或训练班，收到了很大的效果。经验证明：戏曲改革事业必须主要地依靠广大旧艺人普遍地自觉地积极地起来共同进行，才能成功。
    一九五○年全国文联的工作任务，是配合国家建设的总任务，动员与组织文艺界的一切力量，来推进文艺的普及与提高，为将要到来的文化建设高潮准备条件。在这中间，最重要的是推动创作与批评，使文艺作品的思想水平和艺术水平从现有基础上提高一步；密切地联系各地文艺组织，使文联的活动具有群众性。为此，在一九五○年内，文联应该作的工作，有：
    一、推动和组织文艺工作者到工厂、农村、部队中去，帮助他们完成文艺创作的任务。
    二、筹办文学研究所，征调一定数量的有实际工作经验和相当写作能力的文艺青年，加以训练，提高其写作水平。
    三、建立批评小组，对作品经常进行研究、讨论，有系统有计划地组织和发表批评文字，克服目前文艺上缺少批评或批评无力的状态。
    四、充实《文艺报》、《人民文学》等刊物的内容，更进一步地密切其与群众的联系，加强其对群众的教育作用及对初学写作者的具体帮助。
    五、有系统地了解各地方及部队中文艺工作情况，搜集材料，建立经常通信关系。
    六、与全国委员会会议合并召开全国文联工作会议一次。会议的主要任务是了解情况，交流经验，并解决全国范围内的提高与普及的正确关系的问题。
    七、视情况需要，召开临时汇报会议若干次。
    八、继续推动各地成立戏曲改进的组织，以便团结广大旧艺人，自动地积极地进行戏曲改革的工作。
