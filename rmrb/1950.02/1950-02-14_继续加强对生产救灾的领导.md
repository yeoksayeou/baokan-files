Continue to Strengthen Leadership in Production and Disaster Relief

Since the State Administration Council of the Central People's Government issued instructions on production and disaster relief on December 19 last year, production and disaster relief work has been valued by leadership organs in various regions. Several responsible personnel from leadership organs at all levels have successively led cadres to inspect and guide work in disaster areas. The majority of cadres in most disaster areas have also worked very hard, and considerable achievements have been made in rescuing people from the disaster. However, in severely affected areas, the disaster situation is still serious. Therefore, the task of production and disaster relief remains very arduous at present. The news about the severe disaster area in eastern Hebei published in this newspaper today reflects this basic situation.

The State Administration Council repeatedly emphasized in its instructions that "production and disaster relief is a matter of life and death for millions of people, a matter of consolidating the existence of the New Democratic regime in disaster areas, and one of the key issues for carrying out the major production movement and building a new China next year. Under no circumstances should a bureaucratic attitude of indifference be adopted towards this issue." Currently, some cadres in some places still have this bureaucratic tendency. Some only shout about the severity of the disaster; or confuse the lack of food with the disaster situation; only ask for relief from higher levels, but do not go deep into the disaster areas to understand the situation, and do not earnestly organize and specifically help the victims to seek ways of self-reliance through production. Some lightly affected areas have become severely affected areas because they failed to help the victims produce in time. There are also some provinces and regions with disaster situations that have not yet established disaster relief committees; or if they have been established, they have no regular work. This is a problem that urgently needs to be solved in the continued development of a led, organized, and mass-based production and disaster relief movement.

Existing experience fully proves that wherever the main responsible persons go deep into the disaster areas, promptly correct the cadres' paralysis and dependence mentality, overcome pessimism and despair, enhance the masses' confidence in self-reliance through production, and proactively and foreseeingly discover problems and propose solutions, the production and disaster relief work will improve. Therefore, we request that the main responsible persons of people's governments, democratic parties, especially local CCP committees, and people's organizations in various regions continue to go deep into various disaster areas, and mobilize various social forces to closely cooperate under centralized and unified leadership to promote and strengthen production and disaster relief work. Disaster area governments at all levels should universally establish disaster relief committees and establish and strengthen their regular work. Various localities should formulate practical and feasible production and disaster relief measures according to specific conditions and local conditions. We should make full use of the powerful form of political power organization of people's representative conferences at all levels to discuss and solve specific problems in production and disaster relief, make resolutions, and mobilize people from all walks of life to work together for disaster relief. As long as we mobilize the forces of people from all walks of life in disaster areas and non-disaster areas, work hard to produce and save, and practice self-reliance and mutual assistance, we will have a way to overcome the disaster.

Organizing the victims for self-reliance through production is our basic principle in disaster relief work. This principle must be adhered to. Under this basic principle, we should widely mobilize the masses to tighten their belts and help each other through the famine. For the few victims who are on the verge of desperation, we should quickly provide necessary emergency relief in the spirit of "disaster relief is life-saving" to ensure that no one starves to death. But this is only an auxiliary method, and they should be organized to participate in self-reliance through production through emergency relief. The relief grain that has already been issued by the People's Government should be used well in various places. As for the problem of food shortage, it should not be confused with the disaster. The problem of food shortage should be properly solved by various localities in cooperation with financial and economic organs through grain regulation work.

After mastering the policy of production and disaster relief, the key issue is to find specific production avenues. Experience has shown that considerable sideline production can be found in various disaster areas. As long as the masses are organized, loan grain, loans and other production capital are used correctly, appropriate sideline industries are developed according to different conditions in various places, and close cooperation with financial and economic organs is carried out to effectively solve the problems of raw materials, funds, tools, and sales in the production of disaster victims, it is hoped that the goal of not starving people to death can be achieved. A small number of leading cadres in a few disaster areas only know how to unilaterally emphasize that there are no production objects and no capital, and despise small production and meager profits, so they are unwilling to patiently organize the victims to carry out seemingly small sideline production. On the other hand, some cadres are not good at adapting to local conditions, do not study the specific conditions of local sideline production, mechanically and abstractly understand the instructions of higher authorities, or mechanically move the experiences of other places, and often formulate plans that cannot be implemented. Or the plan is good, but it still remains on paper, lacking specific leadership. These should be corrected.

In production and disaster relief, although there are many things we should do, the most fundamental problem is to open up the thinking of cadres and the masses, and to make production and disaster relief truly become a led, organized, and mass-based movement. We must clearly realize that there are still about one hundred days to overcome this year's disaster, and we cannot have any waiting or paralysis mentality. We must resolutely rise up to fight against the disaster. In disaster relief work, the general performance of the vast majority of our cadres and Communist Party members is good, and they can withstand the test of arduous struggle. The Communist Party members and cadres in the disaster areas are not only suffering with the masses in the disaster areas, but are also working with infinite enthusiasm for disaster relief. The problem is that they not only have enthusiasm, but also have ways to lead the masses to overcome the disaster. The performance of the vast majority of the masses in the disaster areas is also very good, especially in the disaster areas of the old liberated areas, the disaster victims have shown a high degree of political awareness. They firmly believe that the Communist Party and the People's Government will have a way to lead them to overcome the disaster. Therefore, the social order in the disaster areas across the country is generally maintained stable. This is the main condition for us to overcome the disaster. We believe that, as the State Administration Council's instructions say, "Under the leadership of the Communist Party, as long as the people's governments at all levels are conscientious and responsible, go deep into the disaster areas, personally take action, lead the masses, and actively come up with ways to save money and overcome the disaster, any serious disaster can be overcome."

### 继续加强对生产救灾的领导

　　继续加强对生产救灾的领导
    自去年十二月十九日中央人民政府政务院发布关于生产救灾的指示之后，生产救灾工作已为各地领导机关所重视。各级领导机关的若干负责人员，先后率领干部，亲至灾区视察与指导，大部分灾区的多数干部也都十分努力，抢救灾荒，已经获得了相当成绩。但在重灾地区，灾情仍属严重。因此，目前生产救灾的任务仍是十分艰巨的。本报今日所发表的冀东重灾区的新闻，正表现这一基本情况。
    政务院在指示中曾一再强调“生产救灾是关系到几百万人的生死问题，是新民主主义政权在灾区巩固存在的问题，是开展明年大生产运动、建设新中国的关键问题之一，决不可对这个问题采取漠不关心的官僚主义态度。”目前在有些地方干部中，恰恰还存在着这种官僚主义的倾向。有的只是叫喊灾情严重；或者把缺粮的情况和灾荒的情况混为一谈；只向上级要求救济，而不深入灾区，了解灾情，不认真组织和具体帮助灾民寻求生产自救的办法。有些轻灾区因为没有及时扶助灾民生产，以致变成了重灾区。还有些有灾情的省区，至今尚未成立救灾委员会；或者虽已成立而无经常工作。这是继续开展有领导的有组织的群众性的生产救灾运动中亟需解决的问题。
    已有的经验充分可以证明：凡是主要负责人深入灾区，及时纠正干部的麻痹思想和依赖心理，克服悲观失望情绪，增强群众生产自救的信心，主动地、有预见地发现问题，提出解决的办法，生产救灾工作就会有起色。因此，我们要求各地人民政府、各民主党派，首先是各地中共党委以及人民团体的主要负责人，继续深入各灾区，并发动各种社会的力量，在集中统一的领导下，密切配合，推动与加强生产救灾工作。灾区各级政府应该普遍成立救灾委员会，并建立与加强它的经常工作。各地应根据具体情况，因地制宜，定出切实可行的生产救灾办法。应该充分运用各界人民代表会议这一个强有力的政权组织形式，来讨论与解决生产救灾中的具体问题，做出决议，动员各界人民合力救灾。只要把灾区和非灾区的各界人民的力量动员起来，努力生产节约，实行自救与互助，我们就有办法来战胜灾荒。
    组织灾民，生产自救，是我们在救灾工作上的基本方针。这一个方针必须坚持。在这一基本方针之下，应广泛发动群众节衣缩食，互助渡荒。对于少数濒于绝境的灾民，应该本着：“救灾即救命”的精神，迅速予以必要的急赈，保证不饿死一个人。但这只是辅助的办法，并且应当经过急赈来组织他们参加生产自救。人民政府业已发放的救济粮，各地应该很好地使用。至于缺粮问题，则不应与灾荒混为一谈。缺粮问题，各地应与财经机关设法从粮食调剂工作中求得适当的解决。
    在掌握了生产救灾的方针之后，具体寻找生产门路就是关键问题。经验证明：各灾区都可以找到相当的副业生产。只要把群众组织起来，正确地使用贷粮、贷款和其他生产资本，按照各地不同情况，发展适当的副业，并与财经机关密切合作切实解决灾民生产中的原料、资金、工具、销路等问题，就能希望达到不饿死人的目的。有少数灾区的少数领导干部，却只知片面地强调没有生产对象、没有资本，轻视小生产，轻视薄利，因而不肯耐心去组织灾民进行似乎是微小的副业生产。另一方面，则有些干部，不善于根据当地情况，不研究当地副业生产的具体条件，机械抽象地了解上级指示，或机械地搬运其他地方的经验，往往订出些不能实行的计划。或者计划虽好，但还停留在纸上，缺乏具体的领导。这些都应加以纠正。
    在生产救灾中，我们应该做的事情虽有很多，但是，最根本的问题还是要打通干部与群众的思想，要使生产救灾真正成为有领导的有组织的而又是群众性的运动。我们必须清楚的了解到：渡过今年灾荒还有大约一百天的时间，我们不能存任何等待或麻痹心理，必须坚决地起来向灾荒作斗争。在救灾工作中，我们绝大多数的干部和共产党员一般的表现是好的，是经得起艰苦斗争的考验的。灾区的共产党员和干部则不但是和灾区群众同受苦难，而且正以无限的热忱为救灾而工作，问题在于不仅有热情，而且要有办法领导群众战胜灾荒。绝大多数的灾区群众的表现也是很好的，特别是在老解放区的灾区，灾胞表现了很高的政治觉悟。他们深信共产党和人民政府会有办法领导他们战胜灾难，因此，全国各地灾区的社会秩序，一般地保持安定。这是我们能够战胜灾荒的主要条件。我们相信，正如政务院的指示中所说的：“在共产党领导之下，只要各级人民政府认真负责，深入灾区，亲自动手，带领群众，积极想出生产自救节约渡荒的办法，任何严重的灾荒都可以渡过的。”
