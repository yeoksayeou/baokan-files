　　The Cultural Education of the Soviet Army
　　Chong Guang
　　In the Soviet Army, from marshals to soldiers, everyone studies. They not only study military science but also strengthen their knowledge of politics, economics, history, and literature and art. They have research institutes, schools, powerful publishing organizations, hundreds of newspapers, and a network of various cultural and educational institutions—Soviet Army clubs, officers' clubs, soldiers' clubs, theaters, libraries, reading rooms, and many Soviet Army soldiers' art study groups, song and dance troupes, etc.

　　During the years of the Great Patriotic War, cultural and educational work was carried out among soldiers and officers in various ways. Seventeen collections of speeches and orders by Marshal Stalin were published in the army, with a total circulation of 57.5 million copies, of which 3.5 million were "On the Great Patriotic War of the Soviet Union." In addition to 256,800 books specially equipped for the marching libraries of battalions and companies, 222,659,800 copies of political, military, and literary books and pamphlets were distributed to the departing Soviet troops. The army printing houses published military newspapers and division newspapers, of which there were 150 daily newspapers alone. The total circulation of all newspapers was 2.5 million copies. To facilitate soldiers of various nationalities with different languages, 56 front-line newspapers were published in the languages of various Soviet nationalities. Radio broadcasts to Soviet soldiers also had a great educational significance during the war. Every day, famous politicians, scientists, technicians, writers, and artists broadcasted in front of loudspeakers. In the army, lectures, movies, radio broadcasts, performances by Soviet Army art groups and actors, etc., were frequently held on the front lines. During the war, theaters in Moscow, Leningrad, Sverdlovsk, and other cities organized about a thousand musical teams to perform on the front lines, holding tens of millions of concerts in the departing troops. Movies were screened on the front lines more than six million times. The oldest Russian national theater in the Soviet Union—the Small Theater of the Moscow Research Institute—did a great job in the departing Soviet Army and naval forces from the first day of the war. The institute dispatched twenty drama teams to the front lines during the war to perform for the soldiers. At the end of 1942, the Small Theater also established a front-line branch. In addition, excellent actors from the world-famous Moscow Art Theater, the Moscow Grand Theater of Opera and Ballet, and others also went to the front lines.

　　After the victory of the Patriotic War, the cultural and educational work of the Soviet Army was not reduced in the slightest. In the Frunze Soviet Army Central Club in Moscow—this huge cultural institution—officers and generals listen to reports, watch plays and movies, read military science works, study the experience of the Patriotic War, and hold discussions... In the Soviet Army Central Theater on the same square as the Soviet Army Central Club, dramas about the military history of the Russian people and the heroic warriors of the past are often staged, and the audience consists of Soviet soldiers, officers, generals, and Moscow workers. In any major city in the Soviet Union, there are garrison officers' clubs: equipped with various cultural and educational institutions. In each unit, there are Soviet Army clubs, where various art performance groups hold reports, exhibitions, competitions, etc., under the guidance of skilled experts, and there are also libraries and reading rooms. Talented actors, singers, dancers, and musicians emerge from the participants of the Soviet Army art groups. The world-renowned Soviet Army Song and Dance Ensemble led by the late Professor Alexandrov was composed of members of the art groups of various clubs. Many of the actors of the Soviet Army Central Theater are members of the Soviet Army drama groups.
