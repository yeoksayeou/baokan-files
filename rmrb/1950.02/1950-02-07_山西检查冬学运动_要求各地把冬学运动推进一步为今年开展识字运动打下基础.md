　　Shanxi Inspects Winter Study Movement
    Requiring All Localities to Further Promote the Winter Study Movement to Lay the Foundation for Carrying Out the Literacy Campaign This Year
    [Reported by this newspaper] The winter study movement in Shanxi Province has entered its climax. The Provincial Department of Education recently conducted an inspection of the winter study movement over the past period, notified all localities, and put forward the slogan "Further Promote the Winter Study Movement on the Existing Basis," requiring all localities to conduct a check and summary from bottom to top before the Lunar New Year, identify experiences, reward models, and lay a solid foundation for carrying out the mass literacy campaign this year.
    The Department of Education's inspection pointed out that a significant feature of this year's winter study movement in the old liberated areas is that the winter study movement has been launched in remote mountain villages, greatly reducing the blank areas of the winter study movement. According to statistics from Wuxiang County alone, 70% of the natural villages have established winter schools. Secondly, the upsurge of rural cultural learning is unprecedented. "Learn culture, open your minds, and become builders of the new China!" has become the universal call of young people in various places after recognizing the prospects of social development. Many young people in Xiyang County are actively organizing youth tutoring classes for cultural learning because they are worried that they will not be able to drive tractors in the future. According to statistics from ten districts in five counties, including Licheng, out of 28,556 young men and women, 27,974 participated in cultural learning. As cultural learning organizations are gradually becoming more regularized, learning efficiency has been greatly improved. According to statistics from 13 Youth League branches in Ping Shun County, in half a month, 167 people learned an average of 30 characters each. The education of scientific knowledge, especially maternal and child health education, has reached a considerable level of universality and depth. Yushi County has already opened two training classes for midwifery, training a total of 75 people.
    In terms of political education, the old liberated areas generally combined it with the central work such as winter production, and systematically taught the first and second volumes of political textbooks, so that the masses had a relatively deep understanding of the establishment of the People's Republic of China, the meaning of the national flag, Sino-Soviet friendship, the people's democratic dictatorship, and the nature of American imperialism. In the new liberated areas, in conjunction with current affairs education, the ideological and policy education of land reform and production were emphasized, directly promoting the progress of land reform work.
    In terms of teaching methods, in addition to regular centralized classes, winter schools in various places pay attention to combining with production and seizing all opportunities to make up for the shortcomings of classroom teaching. For example, Changzhi and other places organized study discussion groups in conjunction with transportation teams. Some villages organize intellectuals in the village to be tutors, and also conduct tutoring after class. The most common method is to organize students to write imitations, write diaries, and combine reading newspapers and writing newsletters, so that they can recognize, write, speak, and use. Winter schools in most areas can also pay attention to absorbing mass opinions to improve and create new teaching methods at any time. For example, Qinyuan Chengguan corrected the phenomenon of fragmented and disorganized content at the beginning of teaching based on mass opinions, and created a unit teaching method centered on problems.
    Finally, the Department of Education's inspection pointed out that the "inspection and guidance" and "teaching system" in various parts of the province have played a great role in the considerable achievements of this year's winter study movement. For example, before the teacher training class went to the countryside for inspection and guidance in Yicheng, winter schools had not been established in most villages. After the teacher training class went down, winter schools were opened in more than 80% of the villages in less than ten days. The winter study inspection teams in Zuoquan, Yushi, Heshun and other counties used the method of holding teacher conferences to exchange experiences during the inspection in the countryside, inspecting and teaching at the same time, and then went into in-depth guidance separately. In this way, the local winter study movement was further promoted.

　　山西检查冬学运动
    要求各地把冬学运动推进一步为今年开展识字运动打下基础
    【本报讯】山西全省冬学运动已进入高潮。省教育厅顷对最近一段时间的冬学运动作了检查，通报各地，提出“把冬学运动在现有基础上推进一步”的口号，要求各地在旧历年前由下而上地作一检查总结，找出经验，奖励模范，为今年开展群众识字运动打下巩固基础。
    教育厅的检查指出：今年老区冬学运动的显著特点，是冬学运动在偏僻山庄开展了起来，使冬学运动的空白地区大为缩小。仅据武乡一县统计，百分之七十的自然村已建立冬学。其次，农村文化学习的热潮空前高涨。“学文化，开脑筋，要当新中国的建设人！”成为各地青年在认识了社会发展远景后的普遍呼声。昔阳县很多青年因耽心将来开不了拖拉机，而积极组织青年补习班，进行文化学习。据黎城等五个县十个区的统计，在二万八千五百五十六名青年男女中，有二万七千九百七十四人参加了文化学习。由于文化学习组织的渐趋正规化，大大增进了学习效率。据平顺县十三个青年团支部的统计，半月内一百六十七人平均每人识字三十个。科学常识的教育，特别是妇婴卫生教育，则已达到了相当普遍与深入的程度。榆社一县已开办接产妇训练班两期，共训练七十五人。
    在政治教育方面，老区一般都结合了冬季生产等中心工作，并系统地教授了政治课本的第一、二两册，使群众对中华人民共和国的成立、国旗意义、中苏友好、人民民主专政、美帝国主义的本质等问题，都有了较为深刻的认识。在新区，则结合时事教育，着重进行了土地改革以及生产的思想与政策教育，直接推动了土地改革工作的进行。
    在教学方法上，各地冬学除定时集中上课以外，均注意结合生产，抓紧一切时机来弥补课堂教学的不足。如长治等地结合运输队组织学习讨论组。有的村组织在乡知识分子做辅导员，课后亦进行辅导。最普遍的办法是组织学员经常写仿、写日记和结合读报、写通讯，作到会认、会写、会讲、会用。多数地区的冬学，并能注意到吸收群众意见随时改进及创造新的教学方法。如沁源城关根据群众意见，纠正了开始教学时内容片断零乱的现象，创造出以问题为中心的单元教学方法。
    最后，教育厅的检查指出，今年冬学运动能获得相当成绩，全省各地的“检查辅导”与“传授制度”起了很大作用。如翼城在师训班未下乡检查辅导之前，大部村庄冬学未建立起来，师训班下去以后，不到十天，百分之八十以上的村庄都开办了冬学。左权、榆社、和顺等县的冬学检查组，下乡检查中用召开教员会议交流经验的方式，一面检查，一面进行传授，接着又分头深入辅导。这样，使该地冬学运动，向前推进一步。
