　　Master This Weapon Well
    Written in Commemoration of the Thirtieth Anniversary of Soviet Cinema
    Qian Junrui

　　Cinema was born in 1895. In art history, it is the youngest art form. In the 55 years since, cinema has grown rapidly due to rapid technological development. Last year, we saw 3D movies in Moscow. A car drove out of the screen, which was really startling.

　　Cinema is the most powerful tool for mass propaganda and education. It obediently serves the class that controls it. In capitalist countries, cinema serves the interests of capitalists, especially the interests of a very few monopoly capitalists. In socialist Soviet Union and new democratic countries, the opposite is true. Cinema serves the broad masses of working people.

　　The main reason why Soviet cinema can become the most progressive cinema in the world is that the Soviet Communist Party and its great leader Comrade Stalin attach great importance to the art of cinema, considering it an important tool for the communist education of the Soviet people, and pay constant attention to it. This gives Soviet films rich ideological content and a high degree of artistry, and ardent Soviet patriotism runs through all Soviet films. It inspires and promotes millions of Soviet people to build socialism and enter communism. These films fully express the sincere wishes of the Soviet people and progressive people all over the world, who are all eagerly pursuing a happy life. Therefore, Soviet films can raise the awareness of the working people of all countries, inspire and encourage them to follow the path of the Soviet people. This is the role that Soviet films are playing in China now. For example, the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association film and picture team, which is now heading south along the Beijing-Hankou Railway, shows Soviet films as soon as they arrive, and is warmly welcomed by the masses. This fact proves that Soviet films have begun to educate the working people in China to understand the reality of socialism and inspire them to continue to advance victoriously.

　　New China's own film industry is still in its initial stage. The Chinese people have long been poisoned by the reactionary ideological films fabricated by imperialism and its running dog Chiang Kai-shek. The newborn film industry of the Chinese people must shoulder the task of eliminating feudal, comprador, and fascist ideas and developing ideas that serve the people. At this moment, the friendly Soviet Union extended a helping hand again. This time, the Soviet Film Export Company and the Film Bureau of our Ministry of Culture jointly organized the Soviet Film Exhibition to strengthen Sino-Soviet cultural exchanges. We deeply appreciate this great friendship. It will add an extremely sharp weapon to the new education of New China, thereby accelerating the arrival of a new cultural upsurge in our country. We must be good at mastering this powerful weapon to promote the construction of our great motherland.

　　好好掌握这把武器
    为庆祝苏联电影事业三十周年纪念而作
    钱俊瑞
    电影出世于一八九五年。在艺术史上，它是一种最年青的艺术。五十五年以来，由于技术的迅速发展，电影的成长突飞猛进。去年我们在莫斯科看到了立体电影，一辆汽车从银幕上开出来，真叫人吓一跳。
    电影是进行群众宣传与教育最强有力的工具。它驯服地为掌握着它的阶级服务。在资本主义国家，电影为资本家的利益服务，尤其是为极少数垄断资本家的利益服务。在社会主义的苏联与新民主主义国家则刚刚相反，电影是为广大的劳动人民服务。
    苏联电影之所以能成为世界上最进步的电影，其主要原因乃在于苏联共产党及其伟大领袖斯大林同志对电影艺术给以巨大的估价，认为电影是苏联人民进行共产主义教育的重要工具，并予以经常的关注。这使得苏联的电影具有丰富的思想性与高度的艺术性，灼热的苏维埃爱国主义贯穿着苏联一切的影片。它启发和推动千百万苏联人民建设社会主义和进入共产主义。这种影片充分表达了苏联人民和全世界进步人类真诚的愿望，他们都迫切追求着美满的生活。因此苏联影片能够提高各国劳动人民的觉悟，启示和鼓励他们走上苏联人民的道路。现在苏联影片在中国所起的作用就是如此。举例来说，现在正沿着京汉线南下的中苏友好总会电影图片工作队，他们一到那里，就放映苏联影片，受到广大群众的热烈欢迎。这一事实证明，苏联影片已经开始在中国教育着劳动人民懂得社会主义的实际，并鼓舞着他们继续胜利前进。
    新中国自己的电影事业还在初创阶段。中国人民曾长期地受帝国主义及其走狗蒋匪所滥造的反动思想影片的毒害。中国人民新生的电影事业要担负起肃清封建的、买办的、法西斯主义的思想，发展为人民服务的思想之任务。正在这时，友邦苏联又伸出援助的手。这次苏联影片输出公司与我文化部电影局为加强中苏文化交流而联合主办苏联影片展览。我们深深感谢这种伟大的友谊。它将为新中国的新教育，增加极锐利的武器，从而加速我国新文化高潮的到来。我们必须善于掌握这把强有力的武器，来推进我们伟大祖国的建设。
