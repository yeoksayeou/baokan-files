Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, February 25th: The People's Liberation Army unit stationed in the Maoxian sub-district of Northwest Sichuan has been warmly welcomed and assisted by the minority nationalities along the way due to its good implementation of mass discipline and the national policy of the Common Program. When the People's Liberation Army advanced to the Wenchuan area on January 16th, the local people automatically prepared more than 2,000 jin of dried provisions for the PLA overnight. Minority nationalities in Lixian County, Hexi, even sent representatives to welcome the PLA. After the PLA representatives explained the people's government's policy towards minority nationalities to them, they joyfully summoned their armed forces to advance alongside the PLA along the Minjiang River to cooperate in combat. On January 19th, when the PLA entered Maoxian County, the battle was not yet over, and the local people ran to put red silk on the soldiers, send dried provisions, and set off firecrackers to warmly welcome the PLA. When the PLA marched towards Songpan, the people along the way secretly prepared dried provisions in advance, waiting for the arrival of the PLA. The mountain people drove more than a dozen sheep down the mountain to welcome the PLA, waiting for three days. When our army advanced to Dongsheng Fort, the mountain people automatically led the PLA to pursue the fleeing enemy. On February 9th, when our army entered Songpan, the gunfire had not yet stopped, and the people opened their street doors, hung red cloths, and set off firecrackers, and raised food to welcome their own troops. The Renminbi was immediately used by the local people. The Han people in the city and the mountain people outside the city, handed over the guns, ammunition, radios, property, and hidden defeated soldiers left behind by the fleeing Kuomintang bandit army to the PLA. The chieftains of the mountain people outside the city also sent representatives to welcome the PLA. The deputy chieftain of the mountain people in Xiani Dam arrested more than 20 bandits and handed them over to the PLA along with their guns. When our army advanced to the Maoniugou area west of Songpan, dozens of mountain people cavalry flanked our army to pursue the fleeing enemy. When our army entered the Halong area in the mountain people region, the mountain people prepared food and tea, and warmly asked the PLA to stay with them. (Attached picture)
