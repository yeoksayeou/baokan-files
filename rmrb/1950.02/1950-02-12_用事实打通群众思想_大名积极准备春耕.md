　　Using Facts to Open Up the Minds of the Masses
    Daming Actively Prepares for Spring Plowing
    [Our Newspaper] Daming County, Hebei Province, is actively carrying out spring plowing preparations to lay the foundation for this year's major production. This year's spring plowing preparation work in the county has once again confirmed a basic experience: work can be fully unfolded only by going deep into the masses and educating them with practical examples. When the county initially deployed the spring plowing preparation work, it only put forward some slogans, such as "compare manure piles," "turn dead objects into living objects, add farming tools," and "repair water conservancy, turn dry land into paddy fields," etc., without helping the masses to think of more specific methods, so the results were not great. Later, the county and district leaders discovered this problem and immediately adopted the method of educating the masses with practical examples, carrying out universal propaganda and education, and then the spring plowing preparation work was launched. The masses in the county generally do not have the habit of accumulating manure in winter, and they all believe that the manure pits are frozen in cold weather and cannot accumulate manure. The leaders universally publicized the fact that Du Hongming of Liu Wan Shui Village accumulated 47 carts of manure last winter, explaining that manure can be accumulated in cold weather, and introduced specific methods. The masses followed suit and launched a "compare manure piles" movement. In Qian Shahe Village alone, 2,350 carts of winter manure were accumulated by mid-March. The sixth, seventh, eighth, and ninth districts of the county are non-disaster areas, and the masses have some savings. The leaders called on the masses to develop water conservancy, but the masses were not active, believing that it would cost a lot of work to dig a well, but they would not get much benefit. The leaders compared and publicized the fact that Su Shen dug a well to irrigate the land and harvested twelve bags of grain per mu last year, while Huang Zhiqi did not dig a well, which led to the drought and death of the crops. The masses gradually realized that digging a well was beneficial to them and slowly took action. Cheng Guofu of Longwang Temple in the county used the bricks he had prepared to build a house to dig a well, and Zhang Xishun went to Handan to buy a waterwheel... Longwang Temple alone planned to dig twelve wells.

　　用事实打通群众思想
    大名积极准备春耕
    【本报讯】河北省大名县积极开展春耕准备工作，给今年大生产打下基础。该县在今年的春耕准备工作中，再一次证实了一个基本经验：必须深入群众，用实际例子教育群众，工作才能全面展开。该县在最初布置春耕准备工作时，只提出一些口号，如“比粪堆”、“死物变活物，增添农具”、“修水利，变旱地为水田”等，没有帮助群众多想些具体办法，因此成绩不大。后来，县区领导上发现了这个问题，立即采取用实际例子教育群众的办法，进行普遍的宣传教育，春耕准备工作才开展起来。该县群众素无冬季积肥的习惯，都认为天冷粪坑上冻，积不出粪来。领导上普遍宣传刘万税村杜洪明去年一冬积了四十七车粪的事实，说明冷天能积肥，并介绍了具体办法。群众都跟着学习，展开了“比粪堆”运动。仅前沙河一村，三月中就积了冬粪二千三百五十大车。该县六、七、八、九区是非灾区，群众有些积蓄。领导上号召群众开展水利，群众并不积极，都认为打一眼井花工不少，却得不了多大利。领导上对比宣传苏申打井浇地，去年一亩收了十二口袋谷子，而黄至奇没有打井，以致庄稼被旱死的事实，群众逐渐认识到打井对自己有利。慢慢行动起来了。该县龙王庙成国福把准备盖房的砖来打井，张喜顺到邯郸去买水车……光龙王庙就准备打十二眼井。
