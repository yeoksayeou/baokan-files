　　Beijing Public Security Bureau Responds to People's Demands
    Dissolves "Lou Bao" and Other Gangster Organizations
    Arrests Chief Culprit Han Qingkai and 29 Others
    Coerced Followers Should Repent and Reform, the Government Will Not Pursue
    [Beijing News] The Beijing Municipal People's Government Public Security Bureau yesterday (12th) dissolved the "Lou Bao," "Luo Che," "Hou Che," and other gangster organizations within Beijing's feudal remnants, and arrested the chief culprits Han Qingkai, Wu Dehai, Li Wencheng, Tian Defu, Zhang Hao, Bao Qisong, and 23 others. For more than twenty years, these gangster organizations colluded with secret agents and feudal gangs, specializing in extorting and stealing from travelers, oppressing transportation workers, and forcing women into prostitution, endangering the interests of the people, and their crimes are numerous. The people of the city unanimously demanded their elimination. When the Municipal Public Security Bureau implemented this decision of the People's Government, it went through meticulous investigation, accepted citizens' accusations and reports, arrested the chief culprits, and will, based on their crimes and degree of confession, either prosecute them according to the law or give them the opportunity for labor reform. For secondary elements, appropriate education will be given to promote their repentance and lenient treatment. As for general coerced followers, they should repent and reform, and the People's Government will not pursue them.
