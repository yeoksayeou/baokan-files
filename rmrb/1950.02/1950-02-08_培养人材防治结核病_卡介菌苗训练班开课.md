　　Training Personnel to Prevent Tuberculosis
    BCG Vaccination Training Class Opens
    [Report from this newspaper] The BCG Vaccination Training Class at the Beijing Temple of Heaven Epidemic Prevention Office officially opened on February 1st. Li Zhizhong, Director of the Central Epidemic Prevention Office, first gave an introduction to BCG vaccination work at the training class. He pointed out that tuberculosis is very harmful in China. It is estimated that at least 300 out of every 100,000 people die from tuberculosis each year. Out of the nation’s population of 475 million, at least 1,425,000 people die from this disease annually. Therefore, we must persuade and educate the masses to get BCG vaccinations. This is an effective way to prevent tuberculosis. The reason why tuberculosis has decreased in the Soviet Union and Denmark is because of the widespread BCG vaccination. In the end, he called on medical personnel to absorb the progressive experiences of the world, combine them with our own creativity, summarize experiences, make plans, and carry out this work in various places.
    There are a total of thirty trainees in the training class. They come from major cities such as Tianjin, Tangshan, Shenyang, Zhangjiakou, Baoding, Jinan, Qingdao, and Taiyuan. The study time is scheduled for one and a half months. (Luo Shui)

　　培养人材防治结核病
    卡介菌苗训练班开课
    【本报讯】北京天坛防疫处卡介菌苗训练班已于二月一日正式开课。中央防疫处李志中处长首先在训练班作了卡介菌苗工作介绍。他指出结核病在中国为害很大。估计每年每十万人中至少有三百人死于结核病。全国四万万七千五百万人口中，每年至少有一百四十二万五千人死于此病。因此，我们要说服教育群众，接种卡介菌苗。这是预防结核病的有效方法。苏联与丹麦结核病之所以减少，就是因为普遍的接种了卡介菌苗。最后，他号召医务人员吸取全世界的进步经验，与我们的创造相结合，总结经验，作出计划，在各地方开展这一工作。
    训练班学员共三十人。来自天津、唐山、沈阳、张家口、保定、济南、青岛、太原等大中城市。学习时间预定一个半月。（罗水）
