	2. Those who do not meet the aforementioned standards may use the democratic appraisal method, based on the tax rate and calculation standards, and refer to the investigation data for appraisal and collection.

	3. In areas that adopt the democratic appraisal method, those in special industries with relatively sound accounting systems may adopt the auditing method for calculation and collection separately.

	4. For smaller units or towns where auditing and appraisal are difficult, the fixed-period and fixed-amount tax collection method may be adopted based on the actual situation.

Article 19: The tax payable by the taxpayer, which is calculated based on turnover, shall be collected once every three months. The portion calculated based on income shall be estimated and collected once by the local tax authorities at the end of the second quarter each year (the estimation method will be stipulated separately).

Article 20: The tax authorities shall collect and deposit the industrial and commercial tax, with the tax payable calculated based on turnover, four times a year in January, April, July, and October.

Those who can collect on a monthly or bi-monthly basis due to local customs or actual circumstances may handle it in advance.

The estimated portion of the tax payable calculated based on income must be completed and deposited into the treasury within July of this year. The deadline for the final settlement and payment at the end of the year shall not exceed March of the following year at the latest.
