Learn to Manage Enterprises

　　The anniversary of the February 7th bloody struggle of the Chinese working class is twenty-seven years old. Twenty-seven years ago, the Jinghan Railway workers were brutally massacred by the Northern Warlord executioners for fighting for the freedom to organize trade unions. At that time, the slogans on the workers' banners were "Fight for freedom!" "Fight for human rights!" On the one hand, this showed the heroic spirit and revolutionary vanguard role of the young Chinese working class who first stepped onto the political stage; at the same time, it also showed that at that time, our Chinese working class was a slave arbitrarily slaughtered and trampled by imperialism and feudal warlords, without any freedom or rights. After the failure of the February 7th Great Strike, the Chinese working class, under the wise leadership of its own political party—the Chinese Communist Party and its great leader—Comrade Mao Zedong, united the people of the whole country, and after twenty-seven years of arduous and heroic struggle, has achieved a great victory over imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucrat capitalism throughout the country. Thus, the social and political status of our Chinese working class has undergone a fundamental change. Chinese workers have not only obtained all the freedom and rights fought for by sacrificing blood in the February 7th era, but also fundamentally overthrown the reactionary rule of imperialism and feudal comprador forces that have long oppressed us, and established the People's Republic of China led by our working class. In the past, they were slaves arbitrarily oppressed, exploited, and slaughtered by imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucrat capitalism. Today, they have become the masters of the country and society—this is the summary of twenty-seven years of struggle.

　　The position of master of the country is the most glorious position and also the most responsible position. In the past, when the reactionary ruling class occupied the position of "master of the country," they only sought selfishness and self-interest, causing the country to fall into poverty, bankruptcy, and the crisis of extinction, and causing the people's lives to fall into the bitter sea of hunger and cold. Now our working class has stood in the position of master of the country. We should make the country a new look. We should first consider the country and the people of the whole country. We must take responsibility, overcome the current difficulties in a planned and step-by-step manner, gradually turn the poor and bankrupt country into a rich and strong one, turn the people's life of hunger and cold into a life of abundance, and lead the people to the happy socialist society that we idealize. This is what we must do and will certainly be able to do.

　　But we still have many difficulties at present. 1950 will be our last difficult year. On the one hand, the revolutionary war is not over yet, and we still have to spend a lot of manpower and material resources to carry the revolutionary war to the end, liberate Hainan Island, Taiwan, and Tibet, completely eliminate the remaining reactionary forces, and consolidate our achieved victories. On the other hand, we have to spend a lot of funds to restore the production and transportation industries destroyed by the enemy. This situation, coupled with the floods, droughts, and insect plagues last year, reduced agricultural production, and the people's burden is very heavy, making the country's finances this year encounter great difficulties. The main way to overcome financial difficulties is to economize and produce. Saving means that the people of the whole country should save on food and clothing to help the country overcome difficulties. Here, our workers should play an exemplary and leading role. In factories and enterprises, we must try our best to save raw materials, cherish machines, and increase labor productivity to reduce product costs. Production means increasing agricultural and industrial production. Increasing agricultural production mainly relies on the efforts of the vast number of peasants; increasing industrial production requires us to manage enterprises well first, which requires our workers to take full responsibility.

　　In the past, we have made some achievements in managing enterprises and increasing production. Take the railway as an example, now our trains can go directly from Manzhouli in the northeast to Guangzhou in southern China, which has never happened since China had railways. The speed of repair is truly amazing! Some factories and enterprises have also exceeded the level of the enemy and puppet rule in terms of the quantity and quality of products. In the Northeast, due to the development of the new record creation movement and the promotion of the rationalization proposal movement, industrial construction has achieved more results. In the production movement, we have produced hundreds and thousands of model heroes such as Zhao Guoyou, Li Yong, Zhang Derong, and Song Chunhua. But in general, we should still soberly admit that we have not completely managed the enterprises well, and some are even managed very badly.

　　In the past, during the period of liberating cities and taking over enterprises, we correctly put forward the slogans of "do not smash the old institutions" and "preserve the original positions, original salaries, and original systems," coupled with the workers' enthusiastic protection of equipment and participation in inventory work, which ensured that the takeover was good and complete, without causing chaos and loss of materials. But in this way, we could not but temporarily inherit the many non-unified, unreasonable, anarchic, and disorganized chaotic phenomena and certain corrupt systems created in the enterprises during the Kuomintang reactionary rule era. Later, various regions and cities carried out some adjustments and reforms to varying degrees, and some corrupt and bad systems were removed, but these reforms were mostly treating the head when it hurts and treating the foot when it hurts, and because our cadres lacked experience and knowledge in managing production, the new systems formulated were not very reasonable or scientific. Especially because each region and each industry went its own way, lacking consistent steps and methods, the original non-unified chaotic phenomena in various industrial sectors were not only not changed, but in some places even became more non-unified. For example, the railway system was the first to be unified in management, and now it is gradually becoming unified in business. But in terms of employee wages and benefits, it is still very chaotic; not only is it not unified inside and outside the pass, but even on the short Zhengtai Railway, Taiyuan and Shijiazhuang are inconsistent. On the railways managed by the Zhengzhou Administration, there are seven different wage and treatment methods. In the textile sector, even business and production management systems have not been unified. Not only do the Shanghai, Tianjin, and Qingdao Textile Bureaus each have a set of methods, but even factories in the same city often have different systems. The situation in the coal mine sector is even more serious. In some coal mines, even the head system that cruelly exploited workers in the past feudal era is still preserved. Bureaucratic phenomena that do not pay attention to mine safety regulations and do not care about the safety of workers' lives still seriously exist. Therefore, in some individual places, due to not listening to the opinions of workers and not taking preventive measures, fire and flooding incidents occurred that burned and drowned people (Lingshan Coal Mine and Hongshan Coal Mine). In many factories and enterprises, institutions that are established for people and do not produce are still not rationally transformed. Those so-called employees who occupied important positions by private relations and bribery methods during the Kuomintang rule era are still intact; while at the same time, many workers and employees who have shown loyalty, ability, methods, and experience to the state and government during the takeover and restoration of production are still suppressed and not promoted. The phenomenon of waste of materials in many factories is still very serious. Many necessary and possible safety and health facilities have not been carried out in many factories. All these show that we have done a very poor job in managing enterprises.

　　Therefore, learning to manage enterprises and transforming bureaucratic capitalist enterprises into new democratic enterprises should become the central slogan of the Chinese working class at present.

　　One of the fundamental differences between the new democratic economy and bureaucratic capitalism and general capitalist economy is that the new democratic economy should implement a certain degree of planning. This first requires that the state-owned economy have unified management and production organization in various departments, and have unified systems in various aspects such as economic accounting, business operation, enterprise management, and wage treatment. Now the Central People's Government has established unified management organs for various industrial sectors. The primary task of each management agency is not only to gradually unify the management of factories and enterprises according to needs and objective possibilities, but also to quickly formulate unified systems in various aspects that can be implemented in order to formulate a unified national economic plan. Here, it is even more necessary to formulate a unified national wage system. The current unreasonable phenomenon that in the same industrial sector in the same region, the wages of employees are extremely inconsistent, and in the country as a whole, the wage of a spinning worker is higher than that of an underground miner and a steel plant technician, and the wage of an employee who looks after the workers' dormitory is higher than that of an engineer, not only does not conform to the new democratic wage principle of paying according to work, but also greatly hinders the unification of other systems. Even the industrial management department is seriously hindered from transferring a worker or employee to other factories or other regions to work. Therefore, the economic management department and the All-China Federation of Trade Unions should consult each other and quickly formulate a standard for a unified national wage system. When formulating this standard, it is necessary to resolutely negate the chaotic, corrupt, and unreasonable wage system left over from the Kuomintang, and replace it with a unified, reasonable, and scientific wage system. It is estimated that the liberation war has not completely ended, the national finances are very difficult, and the burden on the peasants cannot and should not be increased again. It is estimated that the People's Liberation Army, which has contributed the most and made the greatest contribution to the Chinese People's Liberation War, is still implementing the supply system, we cannot and should not implement a high-wage system. On the contrary, we can only implement a low-wage system temporarily. But we must make reasonable adjustments to the wages of various industrial sectors, so that unreasonably low wages can be appropriately increased, and unreasonably high wages, or those that are reasonable but cannot be implemented at present, can be appropriately reduced. Only in this way will it be beneficial to the development of production and conform to the long-term interests of the entire working class and the people of the whole country.

　　Gradually replacing the chaotic, corrupt, and unreasonable systems left over from the Kuomintang with unified, reasonable, and scientific systems is an important step that must be taken to manage enterprises well at present.

　　Secondly, another fundamental difference between the new democratic enterprise and the bureaucratic capital enterprise and the general capitalist enterprise is that all old capitalist enterprises rely on oppressive methods to force workers to work and produce, making "workers become simple appendages of machines," "they are enslaved every day and every hour by machines, by overseers, and first by the individual owners—the factory owners themselves" (Communist Manifesto). This inevitably leads to the increasing aversion of workers to labor. The management of new democratic people's enterprises must enlighten and rely on the sense of ownership of the working masses, and give play to the production enthusiasm and creativity of the working masses, so that the working masses can consciously carry out labor. Turning the slaves who were originally dominated by machines into conscious laborers who manage machines is a real revolution. Machines and technology can further exert their effectiveness when they are mastered by conscious people. This is why the labor productivity of the new democratic society and the socialist society is much higher than the labor productivity of capitalist countries. This is why Russia, which was originally fifty to one hundred years behind Britain and Germany, was able to catch up with and surpass the production level of Britain and Germany in just twenty years (actually thirteen years) after the October Revolution. This is also why some of our enterprises that have initially implemented management democratization have exceeded the production level during the enemy and puppet and Kuomintang reactionary rule periods in less than a year after liberation. Therefore, in all state-owned and public-owned factories and enterprises, it is necessary to resolutely change the old bureaucratic management system, implement management democratization, establish factory management committees, and absorb workers to participate in production management, in order to enlighten the workers' sense of ownership and promote the workers' conscious labor enthusiasm. This is the basic link in transforming old enterprises and managing people's enterprises well.

　　It must be pointed out that at present, there are still many administrative management cadres in enterprises who have not yet figured out the basic idea of relying on the help of the working masses to manage factories and enterprises well. They are unwilling to implement well, or even do not implement, the instructions of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party since the Sixth National Labor Congress in 1948 on implementing enterprise management democratization and establishing factory management committees and employee representative conferences. Therefore, in some public enterprises, the old set of management systems relying on coercion and oppression is still retained, and in individual factories and enterprises, even the head system and the body search system that insult the personality of workers are still retained. This phenomenon must be resolutely eliminated. In addition, some state-owned and public-owned enterprises have established factory management committees, but they are only formal and do not play a role. This phenomenon is partly due to the fact that the old set of management organizations is still preserved, and the factory management committee has become a decoration attached to the old management organization, and partly due to the weak work of the trade union, the trade union is not good at educating workers, enlightening workers' consciousness and enthusiasm, so that the worker representatives participating in the factory management committee cannot play their due role.

　　Administrative managers, party workers, and trade union workers in all state-owned and public-owned factories and enterprises must understand that the factory management committee is the unified leading organ headed by the factory director in the factory and enterprise. This new management organization and management system must be used to replace the old management organization and management system, and all major issues in the factory must be brought to the factory management committee for discussion, and workers must be truly absorbed to participate in production management, so that workers can personally feel that they are the masters of the enterprise, and give play to their enthusiasm and creativity for production. The employee representative conference in the factory should complement the factory management committee and become an organizational form for organizing and leading mass production movements and transmitting the intentions of leaders and absorbing mass opinions under the leadership of the trade union. At each meeting of the employee representative conference, the factory director and other administrative leaders should attend to make reports, listen to the opinions and criticisms of the masses, and quickly implement various good suggestions from the masses. With the factory management committee and the factory employee representative conference, we can rely on the masses to gradually transform all other unreasonable old systems in the original bureaucratic capitalist enterprises and implement scientific production management systems, such as economic accounting, the establishment of various standard quotas, piece-rate wages, etc., in order to achieve the goal of enterprise management. Therefore, it should be emphasized again that the establishment of the factory management committee and the factory employee representative conference system is the central link in transforming the old bureaucratic capital enterprises into new democratic people's enterprises at present.

　　In order to realize the tasks pointed out above, at present, the work of the trade union should pay special attention to strengthening the coordination and connection with the economic management organs. On a national scale, it should establish a unified national industrial trade union, coordinate with the economic management organs to formulate unified systems in various aspects, especially unified wage and treatment systems for employees, and guide trade union organizations at all levels to strengthen attention to production work, which is the main task at present. The trade union organization in each factory and enterprise should cooperate with the administrative organs to gradually reform various old systems, first of all, to help the administration realize management democratization, so as to further improve the workers' labor enthusiasm and organize production competitions and rationalization proposals to improve production. At the same time, it is necessary to pay special attention to the needs of the workers, on the one hand, to urge the administrative leading organs to implement all necessary and possible facilities, and on the other hand, according to the principle of unity and mutual assistance, to carry out various welfare undertakings to alleviate the workers' living difficulties. The trade union should step up the education of the workers, improve the workers' political, cultural, and technical level, cultivate worker cadres, and transfer them to government agencies and economic management agencies at all levels. In this way, the trade union, which has become a truly broad mass organization of workers, can realize its role as the main pillar of the new democratic regime.

　　When commemorating this year's "February 7th," Chinese workers are holding three important representative conferences—the National Railway Trade Union Representative Conference, the Beijing Municipal Federation of Trade Unions Representative Conference, and the Shanghai Municipal Federation of Trade Unions Representative Conference. This is a sign of the rapid development of the Chinese workers' movement after liberation. We firmly believe that the Chinese working class, which has a glorious tradition of struggle since "February 7th," under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party headed by Comrade Mao Zedong, like in the past when it learned to overcome various difficulties and overthrow the reactionary rule, will definitely be able to learn to manage enterprises in the near future and assume its historical mission as the leading class in the great construction cause of the new China!

　　学会管理企业
    中国工人阶级“二七”流血斗争的纪念日已经二十七周年了。在二十七年前，京汉铁路工人为争取组织工会的自由，惨遭北洋军阀刽子手的大屠杀。当时工人们的斗争旗帜上写着“为自由而战！”“为人权而战！”这些口号。这一方面是显示了初次走上政治舞台的年青的中国工人阶级的英勇气概与革命先锋队的作用；同时亦说明了那时我们中国工人阶级是帝国主义、封建军阀所任意宰割蹂躏的奴隶，无丝毫自由权利。在“二七”大罢工遭受失败之后，中国工人阶级在自己的政党——中国共产党与自己的伟大领袖——毛泽东同志的英明领导下，团结全国人民，经过二十七年艰苦卓绝的英勇奋斗，已经在全国范围内，取得了反对帝国主义、封建主义与官僚资本主义的伟大胜利。于是我们中国工人阶级的社会政治地位就起了根本的变化。中国工人不仅获得了“二七”时代牺牲流血所争取的一切自由权利，而且根本推翻了长期压迫我们的帝国主义和封建买办势力的反动统治，建立了以我们工人阶级为领导的中华人民共和国。过去是被帝国主义、封建主义与官僚资本主义所任意压迫、剥削、屠杀的奴隶，今天变成了国家社会的主人——这就是二十七年斗争的总结。
    国家主人的地位，是最光荣的地位，也是最负责任的地位。过去反动统治阶级霸占“国家主人”地位的时候，只图自私自利，使国家陷于贫穷破产与灭亡的危机中，使人民生活陷于饥寒交迫的苦海。现在我们工人阶级站上了国家主人的地位了。我们应该使国家面目一新。我们应该首先替国家打算，替全国人民打算。我们要负起责任来，有计划、有步骤地克服当前的困难，逐渐把贫穷破产的国家变成富强，把人民的饥寒交迫的生活变成丰衣足食，领导人民一直走向我们理想的幸福的社会，社会主义的社会。这是我们必须做到而且一定能够做到的。
    但是我们目前的困难还很多。一九五○年会是我们最后的一个困难的年头。一方面，革命战争尚未完结，我们还要花费很大的人力物力去把革命战争进行到底，解放海南岛、台湾和西藏，彻底歼灭残余的反动势力，巩固我们的已得胜利。另一方面，我们又要耗费很大的资金去恢复被敌人破坏的生产事业和交通运输事业。这种情况，加上去年的水旱虫灾，农业生产减少，人民负担很重，使今年的国家财政遭遇很大的困难。克服财政困难的主要办法，就是节约和生产。节约是要全国人民节衣缩食来帮助国家克服困难。在这里，我们工人应当起模范和带头的作用。在工厂企业中，我们要努力设法节省原料材料，爱护机器，提高劳动生产率，以减低产品成本费。生产就是说要增加农业和工业的生产。增加农业生产，主要是依靠广大农民的努力；增加工业生产，首先要管好企业，这就需要我们工人负起全部责任。
    过去在管理企业提高生产方面，我们已经有了一些成绩。拿铁路说，现在我们的火车，可以从东北的满洲里直达华南的广州，这是从中国有铁路以来所没有的事。修复之快，确属惊人！有些工厂企业，在产品的数量与质量方面也都已超过敌伪统治时代的水平。在东北，由于开展了创造新纪录运动，推行了合理化建议运动，工业建设获得了更多的成绩。在生产运动中，我们已产生了成百上千的赵国有、李永、张德容、宋春化等模范英雄人物。但是一般说来，我们仍然应当清醒地承认，我们还没有把企业完全管理好，有些并且是管理得很坏。
    过去，在解放城市接收企业的时期，我们曾正确地提出“不要打烂旧机构”和“保存原职原薪原制度”的口号，加上工人群众热烈保护器材，参加清点工作，这就保证了接收得好，接收得完整，没有发生混乱现象和资材的损失。但这样，我们也就不能不把过去国民党反动统治时代在企业内所造成的许多不统一、不合理、无政府、无组织的混乱现象和某些腐败制度暂时地继承下来了。后来各地区各城市都多少进行了一些调整和改革，某些腐败恶劣制度是去掉了，但是这些改革多半是头痛医头，脚痛医脚，并且由于我们的干部缺乏管理生产的经验和知识，所以制定出来的新制度也不是很合理很科学的。特别是由于各地区各行其是，缺乏一致的步骤和办法，在各产业部门中原来不统一的混乱现象，不但没有改变，而且有些地方甚至弄得更加不统一了。譬如铁路系统，在管理上是统一得最早的，在业务上现在也逐渐统一起来了。但在职工工资与待遇方面还是很混乱；不但关外与关内不统一，而且在短短的一条正太铁路，太原和石家庄就不一致。在郑州管理局管理的铁路上，就有七种不同的工资和待遇办法。在纺织部门，连业务和生产管理制度，都还没有统一起来。不仅上海、天津、青岛纺织局各有一套办法，甚至在同一城市的工厂也常常有各不相同的制度。煤矿部门的情形，更加严重。在有些煤矿里，连过去对工人进行残酷封建剥削的把头制度还继续保存。不重视矿山保安条例，不关心工人生命安全的官僚主义现象，还严重地存在着。因此还有个别地方，由于不听信工人的意见，不采取预防办法，而发生起火发水烧死人淹死人的事件（灵山煤矿和洪山煤矿）。在许多工厂企业内部因人设事不事生产的机构，至今仍未进行合理的改造。过去国民党统治时期那些靠私人关系贿赂方法而占据重要位置的所谓职员，至今仍然原封不动；而同时又有许多在接收与恢复生产当中，对国家政府表示忠心耿耿有能力，有办法，有经验的工人职员，仍然被压制而未提拔。许多工厂内材料物资的浪费现象，仍然非常严重。有许多必要的和可能的安全卫生设备，很多工厂都没有举办。这些都说明，我们在管理企业方面的工作还作得很差。
    因此，学会管理企业，把官僚资本主义企业改造成为新民主主义企业，就应成为中国工人阶级目前的中心口号。
    新民主主义的经济与官僚资本主义和一般资本主义经济的根本区别之一，就是新民主主义经济应当实行一定的计划性。这就首先要求国营经济各部门有统一的管理以及生产组织，有经济核算、业务经营、企业管理、工资待遇等各方面的统一的制度。现在中央人民政府已建立起各产业部门的统一管理机关。各管理机关的首要任务，不仅要根据需要和客观的可能，将工厂企业的管理逐渐统一起来，而且要赶紧制定可能实行的各方面的统一的制度，以便制定全国统一的经济计划。在这里，制定全国统一的工资制度，更加必要。目前这种在同一产业部门在同一地区，职工工资都极不统一，而在全国说来，一个摇纱工人比一个井下矿工和钢铁厂技术工人的工资还高，一个看工人宿舍的职员比一个工程师的工资还高的不合理的现象，不仅不合于按劳付酬的新民主主义的工资原则，而且大大妨碍着其他各种制度的统一。甚至产业管理部门要调动一个工人和职员到其他工厂或其他地区工作，也受到严重的阻碍。因此，经济管理部门与全国总工会，应当互相协商，从速制定统一全国工资制度的标准。在制定这个标准的时候，要坚决否定国民党遗留下来的混乱的、腐败的、不合理的工资制度，而代之以统一的、合理的、科学的工资制度。估计到现在解放战争尚未完全结束，国家财政十分困难，农民负担不可能也不应该再行加重，估计到在中国人民解放战争中出力最多、功劳最大的人民解放军还在实行供给制的情形，我们不可能也不应当实行高工资制。相反的，我们暂时还只能实行低工资制。但是我们必须将各产业部门的工资，加以合理的调整，使不合理的过低的工资，可以适当地提高，而不合理的或者虽是合理但目前不能实行的过高的工资，可以适当地降低。只有这样，才会对发展生产有利，才符合于整个工人阶级和全国人民的远大利益。
    以统一的、合理的、科学的制度，逐渐代替国民党遗留下来的混乱的、腐败的、不合理的制度，是目前管好企业所必须采取的一个重要步骤。
    其次，新民主主义企业与官僚资本企业和一般资本主义企业的另一个根本区别，就在于一切旧的资本主义企业是依靠压迫方法来强制工人劳动生产，是使“工人成了机器的单纯的附属品”，“他们每天每时都被机器、被监工，首先被各个有产者——工厂主本人奴役着”（共产党宣言）。这样必然造成工人对于劳动的日益增加的厌恶。新民主主义的人民企业的管理，则必须启发和依靠工人群众主人翁的感觉，发挥工人群众的生产积极性和创造性，以便工人群众能够自觉地进行劳动。把原来被机器支配的奴隶，变成管理机器的自觉的劳动者，这是一个真正的革命。机器和技术在被自觉的人所掌握的时候，才能进一步发挥效能。这就是为什么新民主主义社会和社会主义社会的劳动生产率会比资本主义国家的劳动生产率高得多的原故。这就是为什么原来比英国德国落后五十年到一百年的俄国，在十月革命后能在短短的二十年（实际上是十三年）的时间内赶上并超过英国和德国的生产水平的原故。这也就是为什么我们有些初步实行了管理民主化的企业在解放后不到一年的时间，就超过了敌伪和国民党反动统治时期生产水平的原故。因此，在一切国营公营的工厂企业中，必须坚决地改变旧的官僚主义的管理制度，实行管理民主化，建立工厂管理委员会，吸收工人参加生产管理，以启发工人的主人翁的觉悟，发扬工人的自觉的劳动热情。这是改造旧企业、管好人民企业的基本环节。
    必须指出：目前还有不少企业行政管理干部，对于依靠工人群众的帮助来管好工厂企业的基本思想还没有搞通。他们对于中国共产党中央在一九四八年第六次劳动大会以来所屡次说明的实行企业管理民主化，建立工厂管理委员会和职工代表会议的指示，不愿很好地执行，甚至不执行。因此，有些公营企业中，就还保留旧的一套依靠强制压迫的管理制度，在个别的工厂企业中甚至还保留着把头制度和侮辱工人人格的抄身制度。这种现象，必须坚决消灭。此外，有些国营公营企业虽然建立了工厂管理委员会的组织，但是只有形式，不起作用。这种现象，一方面是由于旧的一套管理组织依然保存，工厂管理委员会成了附属于旧的管理组织的装饰品，另一方面是由于工会工作薄弱，工会还不善于教育工人，启发工人的觉悟和积极性，以至工人代表参加工厂管理委员会还不能起应有的作用。
    一切国营公营工厂企业中的行政管理者、党的工作者，和工会工作者，必须明白：工厂管理委员会是工厂企业中以厂长为首的统一领导机关。必须以这种新的管理组织与管理制度去代替旧的管理组织与管理制度，把厂内的一切重大问题，都提到工厂管理委员会上去讨论，真正吸收工人参加生产管理，才能使工人亲身感到自己是企业的主人，而发挥对生产的积极性与创造性。工厂中的职工代表会议，应当与工厂管理委员会相辅而行，成为在工会领导下组织和领导群众生产运动，传达领导者意图和吸收群众意见的组织形式。职工代表会议每次开会时，厂长与其他行政负责人应出席作报告，听取群众的意见和批评，并把群众中各种好的建议迅速地实现起来。有了工厂管理委员会和工厂职工代表会议，就可依靠群众逐渐地改造原来官僚资本主义企业中其他一切不合理的旧制度，实行科学的管理生产制度，如经济核算，规定各种标准定额，计件工资等等，以达到经营企业化的目的。因此，要再一次地着重指出：建立工厂管理委员会和工厂职工代表会议的制度，乃是目前改造旧的官僚资本企业为新民主主义人民企业的中心环节。
    为了实现上面指出的任务，目前工会工作应特别注意加强与经济管理机关的配合和连系。在全国范围内，应当以建立全国统一的产业工会，协同经济管理机关制定各方面的统一制度，特别是对职工的统一的工资待遇等制度，指导各级工会组织加强对生产工作的注意，为目前的主要任务。在每一个工厂企业中的工会组织应当配合行政机构，逐渐改革各种旧制度，首先是帮助行政实现管理民主化，以便更进一步提高工人的劳动热情，组织生产竞赛与合理化建议等来提高生产。同时要特别关怀工人的需要，一方面督促行政领导机关实行一切必要而可能的设施，另一方面根据团结互助的原则，举办各种福利事业，以减轻工人的生活困难。工会应当加紧进行工人群众的教育工作，提高工人的政治文化技术水平，培养工人干部，并且把他们输送到各级政权机关和经济管理机关中去。这样成为真正广大工人群众组织的工会，便能实现其为新民主主义政权主要支柱的作用。
    在纪念今年的“二七”的时候，中国工人正在召开三个重要的代表大会——全国铁路工会代表大会，北京市总工会代表大会和上海市总工会代表大会。这是中国工人运动在解放以后猛烈发展的标志。我们深信：有着“二七”以来光荣斗争传统的中国工人阶级，在以毛泽东同志为首的中国共产党领导之下，像过去学会了战胜各种困难推翻反动统治一样，在不远的将来，一定能够学会管理企业，担负起它在新中国伟大建设事业中领导阶级的历史使命！
