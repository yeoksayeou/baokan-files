Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, February 11th: Due to natural disasters and poor harvests in the Northwest last year, coupled with the destruction of war and the looting by Kuomintang bandit troops, varying degrees of disaster are widespread. For example, some areas of the Guanzhong, Linxia, and Jinji Special Districts are currently experiencing severe winter famine. According to incomplete statistics, the number of disaster victims is approximately 900,000. In response to this situation, the Northwest Military and Political Committee issued instructions on February 9th regarding production and disaster relief work, calling on governments at all levels to immediately take all effective measures to mobilize and organize all forces to carry out production and disaster relief work. The instructions require governments at all levels to immediately take the following measures:

　　Correct the Purely Relief Perspective
　　First, it is necessary to educate all cadres on the importance of production and disaster relief work and correct the purely relief perspective among cadres. Governments at all levels should immediately dispatch a group of cadres to go deep into the disaster areas, mobilize the masses to engage in production for self-salvation, and help disaster victims solve difficulties in production. Local banks, trade departments, and cooperatives must cooperate with the local government to vigorously organize the masses to engage in sideline production, help them solve problems such as production materials and product sales as much as possible, and pay attention to organizing the import of grain from non-disaster areas to disaster areas. The main responsible persons of governments at all levels in severely affected areas should personally go to the countryside to supervise and guide disaster relief, and promptly gain experience to guide and promote the work of the entire region.

　　Overcome Pessimistic and Disappointed Sentiments
　　Second, it is necessary to educate the masses, overcome pessimistic and disappointed sentiments, ideas of resignation to fate or waiting for relief, widely publicize and explain policies, break down the masses' concerns, vigorously promote fair and free lending in rural areas, encourage "mutual assistance and mutual relief," and adopt all methods to change the stagnation of rural revolving lending. For loans established during disaster relief, the government can be responsible for guaranteeing repayment after the autumn harvest. Incorrectly designated class statuses in past land reform work should be corrected immediately, and unfair and unreasonable phenomena in agricultural burden should be appropriately adjusted. Widely publicize policies such as land owned by landlords and rich peasants before land distribution still belongs to landlords and rich peasants, and land of middle peasants remains completely untouched during land distribution, and launch a broad mass self-salvation and mutual aid movement.

　　Be Frugal and Unite for Mutual Relief
　　Third, practice strict economy and oppose waste. All military and government personnel in the Northwest should save one tael of rice per person per day from February 1st to provide relief to disaster victims. All people should plan for the long term, be frugal, and collect various substitute foods to overcome the famine. Promote the spirit of friendship, love, and mutual assistance, mobilize people in non-disaster areas to consciously save food and provide relief to refugees, and promote unity. Educate and mobilize the masses to use the fruits obtained from opposing local bullies and reducing rent for production and disaster relief, and resolutely oppose anyone's destruction and waste of means of production and means of living.

　　Focus on Relief and Support Production
　　Fourth, the Northwest Military and Political Committee has allocated 110,000 shi of relief grain to support disaster victims in severely affected areas to carry out production and resettle refugees transferred from Shandong, Henan and other provinces. All localities must conduct thorough investigations and make good use of the grain, focusing on distribution to ensure that it is all used to support disaster victims' production. The method of distribution should be as much as possible to adopt the method of work-for-relief, and combine it with supporting production, correct and prevent the purely relief or charitable perspective, and oppose phenomena such as equal distribution and random distribution and misuse.

　　Strengthen Leadership and Regular Inspection
　　The instructions finally called on all localities to strengthen leadership over production and disaster relief work, have a good understanding and grasp of the disaster situation, put forward practical and feasible methods in a timely manner, and regularly check and summarize the work, and exchange experiences. Governments at all levels in disaster areas should organize production and disaster relief committees and various disaster relief organizations, and absorb representatives from relevant departments and people's organizations, as well as people who are enthusiastic about public welfare, to participate in unified planning and leadership of the disaster relief work in the entire region. Major measures for various disaster relief work must be discussed by the People's Representatives Conference and the Peasants' Representatives Conference at all levels, make resolutions, and unite and lead the masses through representatives to carry out production and disaster relief work.

　　西北军政委员会发出指示
    动员一切力量生产救灾   
    大力组织群众进行副业生产
    【新华社西安十一日电】西北各地由于去年天灾歉收，加之战争破坏和国民党匪军抢劫，普遍存在着程度不同的灾情。如关中、临夏、金积等专区某些地方目前冬荒严重。据不完全统计，灾民约达九十余万人。针对这种情况，西北军政委员会已于本月九日发出关于生产救灾工作的指示，号召各级人民政府立即采取一切有效措施，动员和组织一切力量，进行生产救灾工作。该指示要求各级人民政府立即进行下列措施：
    纠正单纯  救济观点
    第一，必须教育全体干部认识生产救灾工作的重要，纠正干部中的单纯救济观点。各级人民政府应即抽调一批干部，深入灾区，发动群众进行生产自救，并帮助灾民解决生产中的困难。各地银行、贸易部门及合作社必须协同当地政府大力组织群众进行副业生产，尽可能帮助其解决生产资料及成品推销等问题，并注意组织非灾区粮食输入灾区。灾重地区的各级政府的主要负责人应亲自下乡督导救灾，及时取得经验，指导与推动全区工作。
    克服悲观  失望情绪
    第二，必须教育群众，克服悲观失望、听天由命或等待救济的想法，广泛宣传与解释政策，打破群众顾虑，极力提倡农村中的公平自由借贷，鼓励“互助互济”，采用一切办法改变农村周转借贷的停顿状态。救灾中成立之借贷，政府可负责担保在秋收后归还。对过去土地改革工作中错订的成份立即加以改正，并适当调整农业负担中的不公平不合理的现象，广泛宣传在进行土地分配以前地主富农所有的土地仍归地主富农所有、在分配土地时中农土地完全不动等政策，展开广泛的群众性的自救与互救的运动。
    省吃俭用  团结互救
    第三，厉行节约，反对浪费。西北全体军政工作人员，自二月一日起，每人每日节省一两米，救济灾民。全体人民应长期打算，省吃俭用，收集各种代食品渡荒。发扬友爱互助精神，动员非灾区人民自觉地节约食粮，救济难民，促进团结。教育和动员群众将反对恶霸和减租中所获得的果实，用到生产救灾上去，坚决反对任何人对生产资料和生活资料的破坏和浪费。
    重点放赈  扶助生产
    第四，西北军政委员会拨救济粮十一万市石，扶助重灾区灾民进行生产及安置山东、河南等省移来的难民之用。各地必须周密调查，很好使用，有重点地发放，保证全部用到扶助灾民生产上。发放方式尽可能采取以工代赈办法，并和扶助生产结合起来，纠正与防止单纯救济或恩赐观点，反对平均分配与随意乱放乱用等现象。
    加强领导  经常检查
    指示最后号召各地应加强对生产救灾工作的领导，很好地了解与掌握灾情，及时提出切实可行的办法，经常检查总结工作，交流经验。灾区各级人民政府，应组织生产救灾委员会及各种各样的救灾组织，吸收有关部门与人民团体代表及热心公益事业的人士参加，统一筹划与领导全区救灾工作。各种救灾工作的重大措施，必须经过各界人民代表会议及农民代表会讨论，作出决议，通过代表去团结与领导群众，开展生产救灾工作。
