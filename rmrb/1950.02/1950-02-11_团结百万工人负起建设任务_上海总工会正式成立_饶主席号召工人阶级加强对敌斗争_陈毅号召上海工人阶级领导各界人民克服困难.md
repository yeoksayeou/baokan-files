Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 9th: The leading organization of Shanghai's one million workers—the Shanghai Federation of Trade Unions—was officially established on the 27th anniversary of the "February 7th" strike. The Shanghai Municipal Workers' Congress, which produced this federation, opened on the 3rd of this month and closed on the 7th. The congress was attended by 1,563 representatives, representing 930,000 organized workers in the city, as well as guests including Liu Ningyi, Vice Chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, and worker representatives from Central China, Shandong, Fujian, Southern Jiangsu, Northern Jiangsu, and Northern Anhui. After three days of preparatory meetings and five days of formal meetings, the congress summarized the experiences of the Shanghai workers' movement over the past eight months, followed the basic principles of the national trade union movement, determined the future direction and tasks of the Shanghai workers' movement, and adopted the Shanghai Federation of Trade Unions' Constitution, as well as six resolutions including "Resolution on Several Issues Concerning Trade Union Organizational Work," "Resolution on Implementing Democratic Management in State-owned and Public-owned Factories and Enterprises," "Resolution on Concluding Collective Contracts," "Resolution on Strengthening Workers' Spare-Time Education," "Resolution on Improving Factory Safety and Hygiene," and "Resolution on Changing 'Labor Daily' to a Daily Publication." The congress finally elected Liu Changsheng and 129 others as members and supervisors of the Federation of Trade Unions.

The entire congress proceeded in a warm and intense atmosphere. On the first day of the congress, Liu Changsheng, on behalf of the presidium, announced the official opening of the Shanghai Municipal Workers' Congress. After Zhu Junxin delivered the opening speech, Chairman Rao Shushi conveyed congratulations to the congress on behalf of all members of the East China Military and Political Committee. Chen Yi conveyed congratulations to the congress on behalf of the East China Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the CPC, the Shanghai Municipal People's Government, and the Third Field Army of the Chinese People's Liberation Army. He pointed out that Shanghai workers had already made great achievements in helping to take over and restore transportation and production, and he wished the million workers new and great victories in overcoming difficulties and smashing the enemy's blockade after they were organized. Liu Ningyi delivered a congratulatory speech on behalf of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, calling on the Shanghai working class to inherit their glorious past traditions, carry out new historical tasks, and strive to restore the damaged economy in three to five years and build a new Shanghai and a new China in ten to eight years. On the same day, the congress listened to Zhang Qi, Deputy Director of the Preparatory Committee of the Federation of Trade Unions, deliver a summary report on the work of the preparatory stage of the Shanghai Federation of Trade Unions. On the second day of the congress, Chen Yi, representative of the East China Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and the Shanghai Municipal Committee, delivered a political report to the congress. He said: The working class has gained an unshakable revolutionary leadership position. We must not be arrogant, but rather further develop the consciousness and organizational power of the working class and bravely shoulder the task of building a new China. The experience of the eight months since the liberation of Shanghai proves that the working class is capable of shouldering the responsibility of building a new China. He then elaborated on the tasks of the people of the whole country in 1950, the basic situation in Shanghai, and the necessity of continuing to complete the six major tasks of the anti-blockade struggle, calling on the Shanghai working class to use their wisdom to recognize the situation, recognize victory, recognize difficulties, and to lead the people from all walks of life to overcome difficulties with their patience and labor. On the third day of the congress, Liu Changsheng, Director of the Preparatory Committee of the Shanghai Federation of Trade Unions, reported on the current direction and tasks of the Shanghai workers' movement. The agenda for the fourth day of the congress was to adopt the constitution, resolutions, and elect members. On the last day of the congress, the founding ceremony of the Shanghai Federation of Trade Unions was held. The elected 95 members, 23 alternate members, and 11 supervisors solemnly took office under the leadership of Liu Changsheng, with Rao Shushi, Chen Yi, and Liu Ningyi as witnesses. After the oath, the whole place was filled with thunderous cheers. Chairman Rao Shushi delivered a speech. He called on the working class to wage an unyielding and resolute struggle against the enemy. Representatives of fraternal trade unions from various regions also spoke successively, congratulating the establishment of the Shanghai Federation of Trade Unions. The congress also passed congratulatory telegrams to Chairman Mao, Commander-in-Chief Zhu, and all commanders and fighters of the People's Liberation Army, as well as to the All-China Federation of Trade Unions. During the meeting, Shanghai peaceful residents were indiscriminately bombed by US-made bandit planes. In an atmosphere of grief and indignation, all the representatives of the congress organized a condolence delegation to visit the families of the deceased worker comrades and the injured worker comrades in the disaster area, and to pay respects to the martyrs who had sacrificed themselves for the revolution in the past. In addition, the congress sent a telegram of condolence to the tram worker brothers in Hong Kong, protesting the British imperialist armed suppression of workers' atrocities; and issued a statement firmly supporting the Soviet government's proposal to try Japanese bacteriological warfare criminals, including Japanese Emperor Hirohito.
