    Baoding, Shijiazhuang and other places seize the opportune month to purchase pig bristles
    [Our newspaper's dispatch] Trade companies and cooperatives in Baoding, Shenze, and Shijiazhuang are seizing the opportune month to vigorously purchase pig bristles. Pig bristles are one of North China's main export commodities. In the past, due to the devastation of the Kuomintang reactionary government, the pig bristle industry gradually declined. Since liberation, with the support of the People's Government and state-owned enterprises, the pig bristle industry has become increasingly active. Especially before the Spring Festival, when pigs are slaughtered everywhere, trade companies and cooperatives seize the opportunity to make purchases. In Baoding alone, due to improved purchasing techniques and the correct unity of pig bristle merchants, a total of more than 96,000 catties of pig bristles have been purchased in the past three months, with an expenditure of currency equivalent to more than 6.6 million catties of rice. The trade company has now set up a retail department in Baoding's South Gate and has also established purchasing teams in Lixian and other places. Because the company's transaction procedures are simple, even a few taels or catties can be traded, it is deeply supported by the farmers, who flock to trade. Shenze is a major distribution center for pig bristles in North China. The People's Bank branch has been focusing on supporting the local pig bristle industry with loans since October last year. In the five or six villages surrounding Nanying alone, more than 280 million yuan has been loaned in the past three months, enabling pig bristle merchants to transport more than 17,000 catties of pig bristles from Suiyuan, Luoyang, Xi'an, Taiyuan, Kaifeng, and other places to sell to state-owned bristle stores, an increase of 40% compared to before the loans. Now, each village has formed groups to raise funds, preparing to jointly purchase pig bristles from afar. Shijiazhuang Prefecture also produced a large number of pig bristles in the past. On average, three households raise one pig. During the purchase process, the state-owned fur company in the area found that scattered pig bristles were always sold through private merchants, and farmers suffered from multiple layers of exploitation. Therefore, the Shijiazhuang Supply and Marketing Cooperative issued urgent instructions to its county and village cooperatives, requiring the cooperatives to vigorously undertake the task of purchasing pig bristles. It specifically pointed out: During the purchase, the purchase price must be slightly higher than the market price; and it must be combined with the work of establishing and developing cooperative members. In order to take care of the interests of the members, it is stipulated that the purchase price of pig bristles from cooperative members should be 2% higher than that from non-members, and the method of exchanging goods for goods can also be adopted to prevent farmers from being affected by price fluctuations. Furthermore, in order to remedy the insufficient funds of the cooperative, the Shijiazhuang Supply and Marketing Cooperative has jointly issued instructions with the local People's Bank Office: It has been determined that each county branch will provide special loans to the supply and marketing cooperatives of each county to support the purchase of pig bristles and casings. The purchase work has now been deployed deep into the villages, and the masses are beginning to send pig bristles to the cooperatives for sale.

　　保定石家庄等地抓紧旺月收购猪鬃
    【本报讯】保定、深泽、石家庄三地贸易公司及合作社正抓紧猪鬃旺月大力进行收购猪鬃。按猪鬃为华北主要出口物资之一，过去因国民党反动政府的摧残，猪鬃业渐趋衰落。自解放后，由于人民政府与国营企业的扶助，猪鬃业才日渐活跃。特别在春节前夕，各地都在杀猪，贸易公司及合作社即抓紧时机进行收购。仅保定三个月来，因收购技术提高与正确地团结猪鬃商贩，共收购猪鬃达九万六千余斤，支出货币折米六百六十多万斤。现该贸易公司在保定南关设立了门市部，在蠡县等地亦设收购小组。因公司交易手续简便，虽零星的几两几斤亦可一样成交，故深得农民群众拥护，纷纷前往交易。深泽是华北猪鬃主要集散地，人民银行支行从去年十月份起，便确定以扶持该地猪鬃业为贷款重点。仅在南营周围五六个村，三个月来即贷款二亿八千余万元，使猪鬃商贩得能从绥远、洛阳、西安、太原、开封等地远道贩回猪鬃一万七千多斤卖与公营鬃店，比放款前增多百分之四十。现各村均结组集资，准备合伙远道采购猪鬃。石家庄专区过去出产猪鬃为数亦大。当地平均三户要养一口猪。国营皮毛公司在该地进行收购中，发觉各地零散猪鬃，一向通过私商出卖，农民遭受重叠剥削。于是石家庄供销总社对所属县社、村社发出紧急指示，要求合作社大力担负起收购猪鬃的任务。并具体指出：在收购中，收价须稍高于市价；且和建社及发展社员工作相结合，为照顾社员利益，并规定收购社员猪鬃价格要高出非社员百分之二，还可采用以物换物方式使农民不受物价波动影响。又为了补救合作社资金之不足，石家庄供销总社已和当地人民银行办事处协商联合发布指示：确定各县支行为支持收购猪鬃肠衣，特贷给各县供销社专业款项。现收购工作布置已深入各村，群众正开始向合作社送卖猪鬃。
