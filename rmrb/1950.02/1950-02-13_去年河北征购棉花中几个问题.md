Several Problems in Cotton Procurement in Hebei Last Year
    Our Reporter Lu Hao
    Last year, in order to meet the needs of the national textile industry, the former North China People's Government planned and called on farmers to restore cotton fields. During the autumn grain requisition, cotton was requisitioned in cotton-producing areas in lieu of grain. Now this cotton requisition task has been fully completed. Hebei Province alone completed the task of requisitioning 40 million catties of cotton in lieu of grain, which is enough to guarantee the raw materials for 160,000 spindles for the whole year (calculated based on an average annual need of 250 catties of cotton per spindle). This is a huge achievement. However, the following problems were also revealed in this work, which should be improved in the future.
    I. Insufficient Investigation and Research, Excessive Requisition Task
    Last year, the initial task for Hebei Province to requisition cotton in lieu of grain was 50 million catties. This task was set based on the calculation that the province planted 9 million mu of cotton, with an average yield of 25 catties per mu. According to this calculation, the total output of the province was 225 million catties. Requisitioning 50 million catties of cotton from the province meant that the quantity requisitioned accounted for 22.22 percent of the province's output. However, in fact, the average cotton yield in Hebei last autumn was actually 18 catties and 13.5 liang per mu, making the total output approximately 170 million catties, only 78 percent of the aforementioned estimated number. Farmers paid one catty of cotton in lieu of ten catties of millet. Each mu of cotton field only needed to pay about two catties of cotton, and the province could requisition about 20 million catties of cotton, which is about 10 percent of the actual output. This is about one and a half times different from the 50 million catties cotton requisition task. Taking the Shulu County under the jurisdiction of Shijiazhuang Prefecture as an example, the cotton requisition task assigned to the county by the commissioner's office was more than 1.89 million catties, but the actual requisition in the county was only more than 1.53 million catties, and the remaining 360,000 catties became over-requisitioned. Later, after the government discovered this situation, it reduced the cotton requisition task by 10 million catties. For the over-requisitioned part, grain, fertilizer, etc. were exchanged with farmers.
    The main reason why the cotton requisition task in Hebei was too large was the lack of investigation of cotton fields and cotton production. Until today, there is still no accurate statistical figure on how much cotton was planted in Hebei Province last year. For example, the actual number of mu planted with cotton in Cangxian Prefecture was one-third lower than the originally reported number. Guangzong County originally reported 70,000 mu planted with cotton, but later investigation revealed that it was 50,000 mu. Zhangdongzhai Village in Shahe County originally reported 325 mu planted with cotton, but the actual planting was 115 mu. One household reported four mu planted with cotton, but actually did not plant any. The reasons for the lack of in-depth understanding of the cotton field and cotton production situation are, on the one hand, the rapid development of the revolutionary war and the large increase in new areas, and the large changes in the administrative jurisdiction. On the other hand, some competent authorities did not pay enough attention to investigation and research in this area.
    II. Two Methods of Cotton Requisition
    Since the number of cotton requisitioned in lieu of grain exceeded the cotton field's due burden for farmers, serious difficulties arose. Regarding how to overcome this difficulty, different solutions emerged in various counties in Hebei: one was to handle matters according to the specific situation, implementing a policy of having cotton, handing over cotton, and having no cotton or little cotton, not handing over or handing over less. The shortfall in requisitioned numbers was resolved by the local government in an organized and planned manner by adopting appropriate exchange rates for exchanging cotton, purchasing cotton, and other methods. This was relatively reasonable. For example, in Xiajin County, the total amount of public grain rice collected throughout the county last autumn was 21.7 million catties. With 2.95 catties of millet exchanged for one catty of seed cotton, the county's task of requisitioning seed cotton in lieu of grain was 7,358,012 catties. However, as a result, the county completed the requisition of 4,882,217 catties of cotton according to the actual burden on farmers' cotton fields and their ability to hand over cotton, accounting for 66.35 percent of the county's original assigned number. The remaining 2,475,825 catties of seed cotton were purchased or exchanged through cooperatives. However, in some places, there was a problem of egalitarianism in forcibly distributing the numbers to the lower levels. Taking Wangdu County as an example, the county district distributed the cotton requisition numbers to the villages equally, and the villages distributed them equally to households according to the burden mu, resulting in households that did not plant cotton and households that planted less cotton having no cotton to hand over, or insufficient cotton to hand over, forcing the masses of farmers to sell grain and peanuts to buy cotton on the market without a plan, creating a phenomenon of rushing to buy cotton, stimulating the rise in cotton prices and the sharp drop in grain prices. In this way, the burden on farmers was actually increased. For example, usually one hundred catties of seed cotton is equal to about five hundred catties of corn, but in the above situation, in the seventh and eighth districts of En County, nine hundred catties of corn were used to exchange for one hundred catties of seed cotton; in some places, even five hundred catties of wheat were used to exchange for one hundred catties of seed cotton.
    III. Two Lines in Cotton Purchasing Work
    Calculating according to last year's actual output of 170 million catties of cotton in Hebei, in addition to the requisitioned amount of 40 million catties and the approximately 43 million catties of cotton for mass self-use (calculated at 1.5 catties per person), about 90 million catties of cotton can be freely traded on the market. If private yarn factories purchase and private merchants transport cotton to the Northeast and Northwest accounting for a quarter, the province still has about 70 million catties left. Obviously, purchasing cotton accounts for a larger quantity than requisitioning cotton.
    The several state-owned cotton yarn and cloth companies in Hebei completed the task of purchasing cotton amounting to 60 million catties last year, which is no small achievement, but two lines emerged in the cotton purchasing method. Some state trade agencies had good integration with cooperatives. They helped the recovery and development of cooperative work through cotton purchasing work. The number of cotton purchased by cooperatives on behalf of them accounted for about 30 percent of the total cotton purchased, which played a certain role in shortening the commodity circulation process, grasping cotton price policies, and protecting the interests of cotton farmers. Cooperatives also developed as a result. In some places, members were widely organized to produce cotton ginning in the process of turning seed cotton into lint, which was very popular among the masses.
    However, in some places, cotton yarn and cloth companies were willing to give less or even no cotton purchasing funds to cooperatives, but more or all to private merchants; when buying cotton, the price given to private merchants often exceeded that of cooperatives; individual cotton yarn and cloth companies even tried to control cooperatives through private merchants. The indiscriminate use of private merchants to purchase cotton everywhere coincided with the situation where many farmers were selling rice to buy cotton at that time, causing a period of confusion in the Hebei cotton market, resulting in greater fluctuations in cotton prices and a decline in cotton quality. In Ding County, the price of cotton was too high, and the cotton yarn and cloth company dumped cotton to stabilize prices, while farmers bought such cotton from the cotton yarn and cloth company and handed it over to the government. The supply and marketing cooperatives in individual counties purchased cotton on behalf of cotton yarn and cloth companies, but used the cotton purchasing funds to start businesses in salt and foreign cloth.
    IV. Cotton Requisition and Purchase Must Have Unified Leadership
    Finally, in some areas of Hebei, due to the simultaneous implementation of cotton requisition and cotton purchase, there was a lack of unified leadership, which led to conflicts between cotton requisition and cotton purchase. In some places, the purchase of cotton exceeded the statutory price, which stimulated the rise in cotton prices and affected farmers' cotton delivery; in some places, due to the lack of unified leadership in cotton requisition and cotton purchase, disputes arose over the quality of cotton. For example, the cotton purchasing team dispatched by the Shijiazhuang Cotton Yarn and Cloth Branch Company in Yuanshi County believed that the quality of the cotton delivered by the county was poor and refused to accept it, but the same cotton was bought by the cotton purchasing team when it arrived on the market. The state trade agency has not yet accepted the cotton received by the Linqing government due to quality problems.
    These must be improved.

　　去年河北征购棉花中几个问题
    本报记者  陆灏
    去年，前华北人民政府为适应全国纺织工业的需要，曾经有计划地号召农民恢复棉田，在秋征中，则在产棉区以公粮折征了棉花。现此一征棉任务已将全部完成。河北一省完成了四千万斤的折征棉花任务，足以保证十六万个纱锭全年的原料（按每个纱锭平均全年需二百五十斤棉花计算），这是巨大的收获。但是，在这一个工作中也表现了值得在今后加以改进的下列几个问题。
    一、调查研究不足，折征任务过大
    去年河北全省折征棉花的任务最初为五千万斤。这个任务的规定，当时是按全省种棉九百万亩，每亩平均产量二十五斤计算的，根据这样的计算，全省总产量为两亿两千五百万斤。全省征棉五千万斤，则折征数量占全省产量百分之二二．二二。但是，事实上，去秋河北棉产平均每亩实为十八斤十三两半。则总产量约为一亿七千万斤。只有上述估计数的百分之七十八，农民以一斤棉花折合十斤小米缴纳，每亩棉田只需折交二斤左右棉花，全省可折征棉花约为两千万斤，即约等于实际产量百分之十。这与五千万斤的征棉任务相差约一倍半。以石家庄专区所属的束鹿县为例：专署分配到该县的折征棉花任务为一百八十九万余斤，但该县折征实数只有一百五十三万余斤，其余的三十六万余斤，就成了超征。后来政府发现这一情况后，即减少了一千万斤的折征任务。对于超征部分则用粮食肥料等和农民交换。
    河北折征棉花任务之所以过大，一个主要原因，就是缺乏对于棉田、棉产的调查工作。河北全省去年到底种了多少棉花，直到今天尚缺乏一个确切的统计数字。如沧县专署实种棉亩数低于原报亩数三分之一。广宗县原报种棉七万亩，后来调查是五万亩。沙河县张东寨村原报种棉三二五亩，实种一一五亩，有一户种棉时报了四亩，实际一分也没有种。对于棉田棉产情况不深刻了解的原因，是一方面由于革命战争迅速发展，新区大量增加，行政区辖变动较大，另一方面也由于某些主管机关未很好注意这一方面的调查研究工作。
    二、两种征棉的方法
    由于折征棉花的数字超过了农民棉田应有的负担量，这就发生了严重的困难。对于如何克服这一困难，河北各县曾经出现了两种不同的解决办法：一种是按具体情况办事，实行有棉交棉，无棉少棉者，不交或少交，折征不足数字，由地方政府有组织有计划地采用适当比价换棉、购棉等办法解决，这是比较合理的。如夏津县去秋全县征收公粮米为二千一百七十万斤，以二．九五斤小米折一斤籽棉，该县折征籽棉的任务为七百三十五万八千零十二斤。但结果该县按农民棉田实际负担数和交纳棉花的能力，完成折征棉花四百八十八万二千二百十七斤，占全县原来分配数的百分之六十六．三五，其余二百四十七万五千八百二十五斤籽棉，则是通过合作社购买或交换的。但在若干地方则发生了平均主义地硬往下面分配的毛病。举望都县为例：县区向村是平均分配征棉数字的，村又按负担亩数平均分配到户，结果是未种棉户和少种棉户弄得无棉可交，或交棉不足，结果逼得农民群众无计划地向市场卖出粮食、花生来买棉花，一时造成棉花的抢购现象，刺激棉价上涨粮价大跌的现象。这样，实际上又加重了农民的负担。例如，平常一百斤籽棉合五百斤左右玉米，但在上述情况下，恩县七、八区有用九百斤玉米换一百斤籽棉；有的地方甚有用五百斤麦子换一百斤籽棉的。
    三、购棉工作中的两种路线
    河北全部棉产照去年实际产量一亿七千万斤计算，除折征数四千万斤及群众自用棉花约需四千三百万斤（每人按斤半计）外，可以在市场上自由贸易的棉花约九千万斤，如以私营纱厂购买及私商运东北、西北占四分之一计，全省尚余约七千万斤，很显然购棉比征棉占更大的数量。
    河北的几个国营花纱布公司，在去年购棉工作中，完成了数达六千万斤的购棉任务，成绩是不小的，但在购棉方法上却又产生了两条路线。有些国家贸易机关与合作社有良好的结合。他们通过购棉工作帮助了合作社工作的恢复与发展，合作社代购棉花的数字曾占全部购棉额百分之三十左右，这对于缩短商品流转过程，掌握棉价政策，保障棉农利益，都起了一定的作用。合作社也因此得到了发展。有些地方并在将籽棉变成皮棉的加工过程中，广泛的组织社员轧花生产，很受群众欢迎。
    但是，在有些地方，花纱布公司愿将购棉款项，少给甚至不给合作社，而多给或全给私商；在收买棉花时，给私商的价钱，又往往超过于合作社；个别的花纱布公司，甚至通过私商去掌握合作社。若干地方滥用私商到处购棉与当时不少农民卖米购棉的情况挤在一起，引起了河北棉花市场的一度混乱，结果是棉价更为波动，棉质降低。在定县，曾经发生棉价过高，花纱布公司又抛出棉花平抑物价，而农民又有从花纱布公司买到这样棉花再交给政府。有个别县的供销社代花纱布公司购棉，却将购棉款去做起食盐和洋布生意。
    四、征购棉花必须统一领导
    最后，河北若干地区，由于征棉和购棉同时进行，缺乏统一的领导，致使征棉与购棉发生了矛盾。有的地方因为收购棉花超过了法定价格，结果刺激棉价上涨，影响农民缴棉；有的地方由于征棉、购棉领导不统一，就发生了关系棉花质量争执的问题，如石家庄花纱布分公司，在元氏县派出的购棉小组，认为县里交来的棉花质量低劣而不收，但同样的棉花到了市场，却又被购棉小组买去，临清政府收下的棉花因质量有问题，国家贸易机关至今尚未收下。
    这些，均必须加以改进。
