　　Fourth Day of the National Railway Workers' Union Congress
    Li Jiebo Delivers Summary Report
    Concisely Explaining Six Drafts Including the Union Constitution
    [Beijing News] On the fourth day (10th) of the National Railway Workers' Union Congress of China, Wu Jiemin, director of the Zhengzhou Railway Bureau Kaifeng East Repair and Assembly Plant Union, Dong Xin, director of the Tianjin Railway Bureau Fengtai Section Union, and Jia Xuehe, director of the Dalian Railway General Union, each gave typical reports. Then, Li Jiebo, Chairman of the National Railway General Union, delivered a summary report of the congress.
    In his speech, Comrade Li Jiebo recounted the work of the Preparatory Committee of the All-China Railway General Union before the congress. He then gave a general explanation of the six draft constitutions discussed by the various delegations and special committees at the preparatory meeting of the congress. Regarding the railway union constitution, he said: Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, the party of the Chinese working class, the Chinese Railway Union should enhance the political awareness of employees, ensure and supervise the administration to promote production, and gradually improve the lives of employees. Regarding the establishment of a collective contract system, he pointed out that it is fundamentally to organize production well and protect the interests of workers. Regarding the interim measures for labor insurance, he said: The results of implementing labor insurance in Northeast China have been successful. Employees in Northeast China have initially obtained guarantees in various aspects, thus increasing their level of awareness, enabling production to proceed smoothly. Our labor insurance regulations are very different from the old railways, and also stipulate items that were not available in the old railways, such as living allowances for elderly workers, maternity allowances, long-term illness relief funds, and the establishment of sanatoriums. Regarding the scope of rationalization proposals, he pointed out that under the current circumstances, it should not be limited to inventions and creations, but it should not be so broad as to encompass everything. On the issue of employee education, he said: In terms of political education, training classes should be held on the one hand, and spare-time learning should be organized on the other hand; in terms of technical education, in addition to opening training classes and spare-time learning, the main thing is to sign apprenticeship contracts and use the method of apprenticeship to train young technicians; in terms of cultural education, formal spare-time schools should be vigorously established in the future to improve the cultural level of employees, so as to lay the foundation for employees to further study technology and politics. Finally, he called on everyone to face production and strive to learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union in facing production. He said: Only by doing a good job in production can there be a source of welfare, and the work of the trade union will have a bright future.

　　铁路工会全国代表大会第四日
    李颉伯作总结报告
    概括解释了工会章程等六草案
    【北京讯】中国铁路工会全国代表大会第四日（十日），由郑州局开封东修配厂工会主任吴杰民、天津局丰台段工会主任董新、大连铁路总工会主任贾学和分别作典型报告，并由全国铁路总工会主席李颉伯作大会总结报告。
    李颉伯同志在讲话中历述了中华全国铁路总工会筹委会在大会之前的工作之后，对此次大会各代表团及各专门委员会在大会预备会上讨论的六个章程草案，作了概括的解释。关于铁路工会章程，他说：中国铁路工会应在中国工人阶级自己的政党——中国共产党的领导下，做到提高员工的政治觉悟，保证并督促行政推进生产，逐步改善员工生活。关于建立集体合同制度，他指出基本上是为了达到组织好生产、保护工人的利益。关于劳动保险暂行办法，他说：东北实行劳动保险的结果是有成绩的。东北员工已初步地在各方面获得了保障，因之觉悟程度提高，使生产能够顺利推行。我们的劳动保险条例和旧的铁路比较起来，有很大的不同，而且还规定了旧铁路时所没有的老年工人生活补助金、生育补助金、长期疾病救济金及建立疗养院等项目。关于合理化建议的范围问题，他指出：在目前情况下，不应只限制在发明创造之内，但亦不可宽到包罗万象。对职工的教育问题，他说：在政治教育方面应一方面举办训练班，一方面组织业余学习；技术教育方面，除了开训练班和业余学习外，主要是订立师徒合同，用带徒弟的办法，培养年青的技术人员；文化教育方面，今后应大力举办正规的业余学校，提高员工文化水平，以打下员工进一步学习技术、政治的基础。最后，他号召大家面向生产，努力学习苏联面向生产的先进经验。他说：只有把生产搞好，福利才有来源，工会工作才有光明前途。
