　　Yangtze River Embankment Project Commences in Sections
    84,000 Workers from the Chaohu Prefecture Go to Work on the Dikes; Zhenjiang Prefecture Completes 250,000 Cubic Meters of Earthwork
    [Reported by this newspaper] The Yangtze River dike repair project has commenced in sections. The dikes along the Yangtze River in the Chaohu Prefecture, northern Anhui, are 360 li long and work began along the entire line on January 20th. To ensure the smooth completion of this huge task, the Chaohu Prefecture Dike Repair Headquarters and Political Department moved to offices near the dikes half a month before the start of work to uniformly direct all preparatory matters. The department dispatched nearly 1,000 cadres to the dikes to be responsible for organizing workers, supplying materials, and other tasks. Seven engineering bureaus were established along the 360 li of dike repair line, and all surveying (map making) and division of work sections (based on township) were completed. Twenty-five grain and grass supply stations were set up along the river bank (one every 15 li), each station responsible for supplying 35 days of grain and grass for the workers in its section. The 84,000 workers, organized into three general teams, went to the dikes one after another on the 20th and have already started work according to their work sections. It is estimated that 2.3 million cubic meters of earth leveling (raising and thickening) can be completed before the 23rd day of the twelfth lunar month, if no heavy snow is encountered.
    The Yangtze River dike in Taicang County, southern Jiangsu, is about 50 li long. During the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, the dikes were in disrepair for many years, and the bandit troops also dug fortifications along the dikes, causing extensive damage. During the typhoon last summer, the dikes were breached in many places by floods, and it took several emergency repairs to safely pass the autumn flood season. For this reason, the Suzhou Prefecture Water Conservancy Conference decided to rework and heavily repair this section of the dikes, and it is planned to mobilize 380,000 workers to strive for completion in the first half of this year. Before the start of work, the county established a Seawall Works Office to uniformly lead the project. The workers are divided into brigades, squadrons, and platoons according to districts, townships, and villages, with the main cadres at all levels serving as captains. Labor is calculated based on manpower and land, striving to make the burden reasonable. During the work period, the workers take the squadron as the unit of work and life, working during the day and studying in the evening. The content of the study mainly includes questions such as "Why should we repair the dikes?", "Who will repair them?", and "How should we repair them?", to inspire everyone's awareness of repairing the dikes and improve working methods. At the same time, the county combines dike repair with disaster relief, implementing work-for-relief, with two catties of rice given for each cubic meter of earth completed (generally, each person can complete more than one cubic meter per day). To reward active work, it was decided that upon completion of the project and return home, an additional one catty of rice would be issued for each cubic meter of earth. The first phase of the project focuses on dike restoration, combined with dredging the Sui Tang River. Work began on January 23rd. Since the start of work, the enthusiasm of cadres and the masses has been very high, and they are determined to strive to complete this stage of work before February 10th and move on to the second phase of pile and stone work.
    [Another report] The Zhenjiang Prefecture dike construction project began successively around December 10th. As of January 27th, a total of 15,000 workers have gone to the dikes and completed 250,000 cubic meters of earthwork.
    All construction areas conducted organizational mobilization work separately in November. Through the propaganda and mobilization of cadres and activists, they overcame the masses' dependence and fluke mentality. Dike repair committees were established in districts and townships, and worker teams were organized.
    The workers participating in dike repair are in high spirits and are very moved by the active leadership of the People's Government in repairing the dikes. Teachers and students in various places organized costumed propaganda teams to go to the dikes to carry out propaganda and put forward slogans for meritorious service competitions. Now the work efficiency of the masses has been greatly improved. For example, in Tianchang Township, Qiqu District, Jiangning, each person does more than three cubic meters per day (generally, only one and a half cubic meters are done), and in the suburban area of Dantu City, up to four cubic meters of earth can be done each day. At present, various places are seizing the time to actively construct, and it is estimated that if the weather is not rainy or freezing, the first phase of the project, 400,000 cubic meters, can be completed ahead of schedule before the Spring Festival.

　　长江修堤工程分段开工
    巢湖专区上堤民工达八万四千  镇江专区已完成二十五万土方
    【本报讯】长江江堤修复工程已分段开工。皖北巢湖专区沿江堤岸长三百六十华里，于一月二十日全线开工。为保证这一巨大任务顺利完成，在开工前半月，巢湖专区修堤指挥部暨政治部就迁到江堤附近办公，统一指挥各项准备事宜。该部派遣近千干部上堤，负责组织民工、供给材料等工作。在三百六十里的修堤线上，分设了七个工程局，已完成全部放样（制图样）与划分工段（以乡为单位）工作。沿江岸设立了二十五处粮草供应站（每十五里设一处），各站负责供应各该段民工三十五天的粮草。八万四千民工，编成三个总队，于二十日相继上堤，并已按工段开工。估计至农历十二月二十三日以前，如不遇大雪，将可完成平工（加高培厚）二百三十万方土。
    苏南太仓县沿长江江堤，长约五十华里。在国民党反动统治时期江堤长年失修，匪军又沿江堤挖掘工事，大肆破坏，整个堤防破损甚重。去夏台风过境时，江堤被洪水冲溃多处，经几次抢修始安渡秋汛。为此，苏州专区水利会议决定对该段江堤加工重修，预定全部工程需动员三十八万民工，争取在今年上半年内完成。开工前，该县成立了海塘工务所，统一领导工程进行。民工按区、乡、村分为大队、中队、分队，以各级主要干部为队长。按劳力、土地计算人工，尽量作到负担合理。民工在工作期间，以中队为工作及生活单位，白天工作，晚上学习，学习内容主要是“为什么要修江堤”“谁来修”“怎样修”等问题，启发大家修堤自觉性改进作工方法。同时该县修堤和救灾结合，实行以工代赈，每作好一方土代赈大米二斤（一般每人每天可作一方多）。为奖励积极工作，决定工程期满复员时，再按每方土补发大米一斤。第一期工程方针是以复堤为主，结合疏浚隋塘河。并已于一月二十三日开工。开工以来，干部群众情绪很高，决心争取在二月十日前完成这一阶段的工作，转入第二期桩石工程。
    【又讯】镇江专区江堤修筑工程于十二月十日前后陆续动工，至一月二十七日止，共有民工一万五千人上堤，并已完成土方二十五万公方。
    各施工地区于十一月间即分别进行组织动员工作，通过干部和积极分子的宣传动员，克服了群众的依赖思想和侥幸心理，区乡成立了修堤委员会，组织了民工队。
    参加修堤的民工情绪很高，对于人民政府的积极领导修堤非常感动。各地教师、学生组织了化装宣传队上堤宣传，并提出了立功竞赛的口号。现在群众的工作效率大大提高了，如江宁七区天昌乡每人每天做三方多（一般的只做到一方半），丹徒城郊区每天最多做到四方土。目前各地正抓紧时间积极修筑，估计如天气不下雨，不上冻，第一期工程四十万公方在春节以前可提早完成。
