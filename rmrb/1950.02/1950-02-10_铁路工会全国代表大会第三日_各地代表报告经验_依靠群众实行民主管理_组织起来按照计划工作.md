　　Third Day of the National Railway Workers' Union Congress
    Representatives from Various Regions Report on Experiences
    Relying on the Masses to Implement Democratic Management  Organize and Work According to Plan
    [Beijing News] The third day of the National Railway Workers' Union Congress of China—the 9th—began with reports in the morning from Li Mingzhe, Chairman of the Northeast Railway General Trade Union, and Xu Ping, Vice Chairman of the Tianjin Railway Bureau General Trade Union, on the experiences of the Northeast and Tianjin Railways in implementing democratic management. They proposed: establishing management committees in factories, sections, and stations, with administrative leaders primarily having a perspective of relying on the masses; before establishing them, it is necessary to conduct thorough democratic education among the masses to dispel ideological concerns and provide a certain understanding of democratic management. Then, absorb the opinions of the masses, examine the main shortcomings and defects of each department, and provide appropriate solutions. In this way, once the management committee is established, it will create prestige among the masses. After its establishment, employees must feel that they truly have democratic rights. Major issues related to production and management, such as production plans, management systems, production organization, personnel transfers, and employee welfare, must be researched and discussed by the management committee and decisions made before implementation. Since the implementation of democratic management, the Northeast and Tianjin Railways have achieved great results in preventing accidents and reducing costs.
    Next, Liu Guilin, the representative of the Qiqihar Inspection Section of the Northeast Railway, reported on the role of the union in production, saying: To ensure the completion of administrative tasks, we must rely on the union to organize workers and give play to the enthusiasm and creativity of the masses. After receiving work tasks, the Qiqihar Inspection Section Trade Union organizes employees to conduct thorough discussions, formulate production plans, and carry out work according to the plans. In this way, there will be no temporary panic, and work efficiency will be improved. In addition, the union has established joint labor organizations based on the specific conditions of the section, so that various tasks can be reasonably coordinated. The union also regularly organizes savings competitions, cleaning campaigns, and safety facility inspections. It has achieved results in reducing costs by utilizing waste materials and has also done a good job in employee welfare. In the afternoon, Ye Keming (Deputy Director of the Political Department of the Tianjin Railway Bureau), the Chinese railway representative who attended the World Land and Air Transport Workers' Conference, gave a report. When he mentioned that Comrade Li Jiebo, Director of the Preparatory Committee of the National Railway Federation of Trade Unions, had been elected as a member of the World Land and Air Transport Workers' Union, the audience applauded warmly. Then he introduced the glorious achievements of Soviet railway construction.

　　铁路工会全国代表大会第三日
    各地代表报告经验
    依靠群众实行民主管理  组织起来按照计划工作
    【北京讯】中国铁路工会全国代表大会第三日——九日，上午由东北铁路总工会主席李明哲及天津局总工会副主席徐平报告东北及天津铁路实行民主管理的经验，他们提出：成立厂、段、站管理委员会，行政负责人主要要有依靠群众的观点；成立之前需在群众中进行深入的民主教育，使群众打破思想顾虑，并对民主管理有一定的认识。然后吸收群众意见，检查各该部门的主要弊病与缺陷，并予以适当的解决。这样管委会一经建立，就在群众中造成了威信。成立以后要使员工感到真正有民主权利。关于生产及管理上的重大问题如生产计划，管理制度、生产组织、人事调动、职工福利等问题，都要经过管委会研究讨论并作出决议，然后执行。东北和天津铁路自实行民主管理以来，在防止事故和减低成本上收到了很大的成绩。
    接着，东北齐齐哈尔检车段工会代表刘贵临报告该段工会在生产中的作用时说：要保证行政任务的完成，就必须靠工会把工人组织起来，发挥群众的积极性和创造性。齐齐哈尔检车段工会，每次在接受工作任务之后，都是组织员工很好地进行讨论，订出生产计划，按照计划去进行工作。这样就不会临时感到慌乱，提高了工作效率。另外，工会并根据段上的具体情况建立起联合劳动组织，使各种工作得到合理的配合。工会还经常组织节约竞赛，清洁运动，及安全设施检查等工作，在利用废料减低成本方面获得了成绩，同时也相当地搞好了职工福利工作。下午，出席世界陆空运输工人会议的中国铁路代表叶克明（天津铁路局政治部副主任）报告。在他提到全国铁路总工会筹委会主任李颉伯同志业已当选世界陆空运输工会委员时，全场热烈鼓掌。接着他介绍了苏联铁路建设辉煌的成绩。
