Business Community Expresses:
    Soviet Loans to China Aid Economic Construction

    On the morning of the 16th, more than ten members of the Beijing Federation of Industry and Commerce Preparatory Committee, representing the capital's business community, gathered to study the contents of the treaty and agreements in detail. They unanimously agreed that the people of China and the Soviet Union were further united. Especially when China's finances and economy were in difficulty, the Soviet Union provided loans to China with preferential terms of an annual interest rate of 1% and repayment of principal in installments over ten years, which greatly helped the new China's economic construction. It will shorten China's path to industrialization. Sun Fuling, manager of Fuxing Flour Mill, said: For more than a decade, due to the dumping of Japanese and American goods in China, which occupied the Chinese market, national industry and commerce were oppressed and left only on their last breath. It was not until after liberation that the oppression of imperialism was eliminated and gradual development was achieved. The new treaty signed between China and the Soviet Union to safeguard world peace and prevent imperialist aggression has added a powerful guarantee to the development of China's national industry and commerce. Tang Shaoyuan, manager of Daxihua Wine Company, Tang Qingyong, manager of the Beijing branch of Shanghai Bank, and Qin Zhibu, head of the Beijing Money Industry Association, said that the conclusion of the new treaty between China and the Soviet Union shattered the American imperialists' attempts to sow discord. Soviet loans to China, on the other hand, have provided greater security for the development of Chinese industry and commerce. Wang Xiangchen, head of the Machine and Iron Industry Association, said: We must thank Marshal Stalin for his enthusiastic assistance to the Chinese people, and we must do our best in the future to work hard for the construction of the new China. Liu Yifeng, head of the National Pharmaceutical Industry Association, said: We must extensively and deeply publicize the great friendship of the Soviet Union to the Chinese people, so that everyone engaged in industry and commerce will have a deep understanding of this treaty and agreement; contribute our strength, work hard to develop production, and contribute to the economic construction of the new China, and live up to the Soviet Union's friendly assistance.
    When the Ministry of Health of the Central People's Government held an enlarged ministerial meeting on the 16th, Minister Li Dequan first conveyed the news of the signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance. She said: The conclusion of this Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance has made the Chinese people further recognize the sincere friendship of the Soviet Union to the Chinese people. She called on all cadres of the Ministry of Health and staff of its affiliated units to study and research the true spirit of this treaty sentence by sentence and clause by clause, and to actively publicize it. The Sino-Soviet Friendship Association of the Ministry of Health of the Central People's Government also held a celebration meeting on Lunar New Year's Eve to celebrate the signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance.

　　工商界表示
    苏联贷款给我国帮助了经济建设
    十六日上午，代表首都工商界的北京工商联合会筹备会的委员十余人，集会详细研读了条约和协定的内容后，一致认为：中苏两国人民更进一步地团结起来了。特别是在中国财政经济困难的时候，苏联以年利百分之一、十年分期还本的优惠条件贷款给中国，对新中国经济建设有极大帮助。它将缩短中国走向工业化的路程。福兴面粉厂经理孙孚凌说：近十几年以来，由于日货、美货在中国倾销，占领了中国市场，民族工商业被压迫得只剩了奄奄一息。直至解放以后，才扫除了帝国主义的压迫，逐步得到发展。中苏两国为保卫世界和平、防止帝国主义侵略而订的新条约，对中国民族工商业的发展更增加了有力的保障。大喜葡萄酒公司经理汤绍远、上海银行北京分行经理唐庆永、北京钱业公会负责人秦芝圃表示，中苏缔结新条约，粉碎了美帝的挑拨离间。苏联贷款给中国，却使中国工商业的发展更有了保障。机器铁工业公会负责人王向辰说：我们要感谢斯大林大元帅对中国人民的热情援助，我们今后更要各尽所能，为新中国建设而努力。国药业公会负责人刘一峰说：我们要广泛地深入宣传苏联对中国人民的伟大友谊，使每一个从事工商业的人对这项条约和协定都有深切的认识；拿出力量来，努力发展生产，对新中国的经济建设尽一份力量，不辜负苏联的友谊帮助。
    中央人民政府卫生部于十六日召开扩大部务会议时，李德全部长首先传达中苏签定友好同盟互助条约的消息。她说：这个友好同盟互助条约的订立，使中国人民更进一步认识了苏联对中国人民的真诚友谊。她号召卫生部全体干部及所属各单位工作人员逐句逐条的学习研究这个条约的真正精神，并要积极宣传。中央人民政府卫生部中苏友好协会并于旧历除夕举行庆祝中苏友好同盟互助条约的签订大会。
