　　Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, February 11th: According to a TASS dispatch on the 4th: American reactionaries, in order to rally fascist forces, recently held two secret meetings. The United Organization of the Three M Party held its founding convention in Jacksonville, Florida. At the same time, another meeting was held in New York, attended by former U.S. Ambassador to the Soviet Union Smith, Senator Mont, AFL reactionary leader Woll, CIO reactionary leader Carey, and the vicious journalist Sokolsky.

　　Carey declared at the meeting: "In the last war, we fought against the fascists together with the communists. In the new war, we will join the fascists to destroy the communists." Mont insisted that special agent "squads" should be established everywhere, in all enterprises, in all institutions, and in all schools to monitor communists and "pro-communist elements."

　　Saslavsky commented in an article in Pravda on the 4th: The New York meeting itself is an action towards the establishment of an American fascist party. All the "invisible empires" within the United States have now become a visible united front. Wall Street has become the main nest of the Ku Klux Klan. The United States is moving towards the complete elimination of democracy.

    【新华社北京十一日电】据塔斯社四日讯：美国反动派为纠集法西斯力量，最近曾举行两个秘密会议。三明党的联合组织，在佛罗里达州杰克逊维尔举行了成立大会。与此同时，在纽约举行了另一个会议，参加的有前美驻苏大使史密斯、参议员蒙特、劳联反动头子乌尔、产联反动领袖加莱，以及恶毒的新闻记者索柯尔斯基。
    加莱在会上声称：“在上次战争中，我们曾与共产党人一起和法西斯分子作战，在新的战争中，我们将与法西斯分子一起来摧毁共产党人。”蒙特则坚持在每一个地方，在一切企业，在一切机关，在一切学校中，均应成立特务“小队”，以监视共产党人及“亲共分子”。
    萨斯拉夫斯基四日在真理报上撰文评论称：纽约会议本身就是走向成立美国法西斯党的一个行动。目前美国国内的所有“无形帝国”已成为有形的统一阵线。华尔街已变为三Ｋ党的主要巢穴。美国正走向完全消灭民主的道路。
