　　Xinhua News Agency, Changsha, February 2nd: The first Provincial Party Congress convened by the CCP Hunan Provincial Committee successfully concluded on January 19th. Two hundred and sixty-six Communist Party representatives from all parts of Hunan Province participated in the meeting. According to the instructions of the CCP Central Committee and the Central South Bureau, and the demands of the people of Hunan, the meeting decided that the central work of the Communist Party of Hunan Province in 1950 would be to organize and lead the people of Hunan to suppress the remaining bandits, launch a peasant movement against local bullies and for rent reduction in preparation for land distribution, and carry out production for disaster relief and famine prevention. Surrounding the above three major tasks will be other tasks such as transforming the regime and strengthening the Party.

　　The meeting analyzed the current basic situation in Hunan, believing that the workers, peasants, and revolutionary intellectuals of Hunan have a high degree of revolutionary enthusiasm under the encouragement of the current victorious situation. After several months of work such as supporting the front lines and the autumn grain requisitioning, the Party and the People's Government have established a certain connection with the masses. The revolutionary order in the province has been generally stabilized, except for a few counties in western Hunan, but some bandits and scattered bandits in various places have not yet been eliminated. At present, there is a lack of food and various materials throughout the province, and a serious famine is likely to occur between spring and summer; the masses have basically not yet been mobilized and organized; and the lower-level regime has not yet been transformed. Based on the above situation, the meeting decided that the Hunan Provincial Communist Party will adopt the following work guidelines this year: First, resolutely and thoroughly eliminate the remaining bandits and special agent armed forces; second, step by step and steadily eliminate the political rule of feudal forces, launch a mass movement against local bullies and for rent reduction, and prepare to implement land distribution; third, promote production and thrift, and implement disaster relief and famine prevention. This year, the main focus is on fully restoring production, accumulating funds in a planned way, and striving for the development and improvement of certain major undertakings based on possibility and necessity. In addition, it is necessary to call for thrift and famine prevention, mobilize the masses to produce and save themselves in areas where disasters may occur, and implement the State Council's instructions to "not starve a single person to death, nor leave an acre of land uncultivated"; and carry out production movements in organs and troops to reduce the burden on the people.

　　The meeting also discussed the consolidation of the Hunan People's Democratic United Front and the universal convening of people's representative conferences at all levels. The meeting called on all party members to strengthen the Party's organization and discipline, be modest and prudent, study hard, strengthen ideological training, and achieve a high degree of unity and political consistency within the entire Hunan Party, and strive to implement the three major central tasks.

　　中共湖南省委员会召开全省党员代表会
    决定今年中心工作为领导人民清剿残匪、反霸减租、生产救灾
    【新华社长沙二日电】中共湖南省委召开的第一次全省党员代表会议已于一月十九日胜利闭幕。参加此次会议的有湖南省各地共产党员代表二百六十六人。会议根据中共中央及中南局指示和湖南人民的要求，决定一九五○年湖南省共产党的中心工作是组织与领导湖南人民清剿残余土匪，展开反恶霸减租的农民运动，以准备分配土地，以及进行生产救灾备荒，并围绕上述三大工作，进行改造政权、建党等其他工作。
    会议分析了目前湖南的基本情况，认为湖南的工人、农民和革命知识分子在目前胜利形势的鼓舞下，有着高度的革命热情。经过解放后几个月的支援前线、秋季征粮等项工作，党和人民政府已与群众建立了一定联系。全省革命秩序除湘西少数县份外已大体稳定，但各地仍有部分股匪及散匪尚未肃清。目前全省粮食及各种物资均感缺乏，春夏之间很可能发生严重饥荒；群众基本上尚未发动与组织起来；下层政权还未改造。根据上述情况，会议决定今年湖南省共产党采取如下工作方针：第一、坚决、彻底地肃清残余土匪特务武装；第二、有步骤地、稳步地消灭封建势力的政治统治，展开反恶霸和减租的群众运动，准备实行分配土地；第三、生产节约，救灾备荒。今年主要是全力恢复生产，有计划地积蓄资金，根据可能与必需，争取某些主要事业的发展与提高。此外，要号召节约备荒，在可能发生灾荒地区，发动群众生产自救，执行政务院“不饿死一个人，不荒一亩地”的指示；开展机关部队的生产运动，以减轻人民负担。
    会议并讨论了巩固湖南人民民主统一战线和普遍召开各界人民代表会议的工作。会议号召全体党员应加强全党的组织性和纪律性，谦虚谨慎，努力学习，加强思想锻炼，达到湖南全党高度的团结与政治上的一致，为贯彻三大中心任务而奋斗。
