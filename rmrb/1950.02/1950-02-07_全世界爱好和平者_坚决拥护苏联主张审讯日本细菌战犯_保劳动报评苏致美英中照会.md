Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 6th: TASS, Sofia, 6th: *The Labor Daily*'s commentary on the Soviet Union's note to the United States, Britain, and China stated: The entire peace-loving humanity has long declared that the use of bacteriological weapons is the most serious crime that violates the honor of the people of the world and goes against their conscience. The four powers—the Soviet Union, the United States, Britain, and China—had resolved that, after the war, all war criminals should be held strictly accountable for the war. Therefore, the Soviet government now has every reason to insist that an international special military tribunal should try the Japanese Emperor and his generals. The Soviet government's demand is supported by the entire peace-loving humanity and the entire civilized world.

　　全世界爱好和平者  坚决拥护苏联主张审讯日本细菌战犯  保劳动报评苏致美英中照会
    【新华社北京六日电】塔斯社索非亚六日讯：劳动报评论苏联致美、英、中三国的照会称：整个爱好和平的人类，许久以前就曾宣称使用细菌武器是破坏世界人民的名誉，违背他们的良心的最严重的罪行。四强——苏、美、英、中——曾通过决议：在战争结束后，要令所有战犯对战争严格负责。因此，苏联政府现在有一切理由坚主由国际特别军事法庭来审讯日皇及其将军们。苏联政府的要求，是为整个爱好和平的人类，整个文明世界所拥护的。
