[Beijing News] After the illegal small coal mines within the Mentougou public-owned mining area were closed due to damaging public mining resources and hindering mechanized mining projects, the Beijing Municipal People's Government, in addition to prioritizing the employment of workers from the closed small mines, also assisted the mine owners in resolving their difficulties. If the mine owners wished to sell the houses and equipment of the small mines, the Jingxi Mining Bureau would provide appropriate valuations, and the Mentougou Mining Company would prepare funds to purchase them. At the same time, the government mobilized and assisted mine owners in relocating and developing in legitimate areas in the west. When facing financial difficulties, the government would also introduce them to banks for loans. In the past six months, the Mentougou Mining Company has purchased the houses of 33 small mines, including Yongxing and Baofeng, with a total value equivalent to 25,351 jin of millet. In addition, it also purchased the coal mining equipment, such as electric motors and iron pipes, from 11 mines, including Yongxing, with a total value equivalent to 49,600 jin of millet and 1,352,000 yuan in cash. The Chengzi Mine purchased houses from 10 mines, including Tianfu and Tiancheng, totaling 149 rooms, with a value equivalent to 70,085 jin of millet. The Chengzi Mine purchased equipment from 6 mines, including Huazhong and Zhenxing, with a total value equivalent to 3,537,736 yuan. The public-owned mines spent a total of 235,036 jin of millet and 4,800,000+ yuan in cash for purchasing the above-mentioned small mine properties. The government helped the following small mines to relocate and start mining in legitimate areas in the west: Wuxingyu relocated to open Jusheng Mine, Tongqing Xinji relocated to open Fuxinghe, Beiyicheng relocated to open Tongxing Mine, Hexing Mine relocated to open Xiqingsheng, Zhongyuan Mine relocated to open Jiulongshan, Tianfu Mine relocated to open Jiuda, Chengcheng Mine relocated to open Heta, and Sanhe Mine relocated to open Zengxing Mine. For these mines, the Jingxi Mining Bureau, in addition to approving their resumption of work, also tried its best to support their development, introduce small mines with difficulties to the People's Bank for loans, or help organize their joint drainage.
