　　We Took Another Lesson in Internationalist Politics
　　Luo Changpei
　　On the morning of February 15, 1950, I heard on the radio that the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance, and Mutual Assistance, and agreements on the Changchun Railway, Lushun, Dalian, and loans, were signed simultaneously in Moscow on the 14th.

　　This is the first treaty the People's Republic of China has concluded with a foreign country, and it is also the first equal and mutually beneficial treaty in China's diplomatic history in nearly a century. No wonder the people across the country are rejoicing and celebrating enthusiastically.

　　Among those who do not have a clear understanding of internationalism, a series of questions have arisen: After the establishment of the People's Government, all treaties signed by the Kuomintang were denied, why is the Sino-Soviet treaty the only one retained? Why is the Soviet Union allowed to continue stationing troops in Lushun and Dalian? Why is the Changchun Railway still under joint Sino-Soviet administration? Some people have also raised some relatively naive questions: Since we are wary of American imperialism, why aren't we afraid of the Soviet Union? What if we talk about internationalism but the Soviet Union doesn't? After a considerable period of political study, those who understand how to look at problems comprehensively, not one-sidedly, or who know how to look at problems from their essence, not superficially, will understand that these questions are incorrect. However, suspicions of this kind are inevitably still present in the minds of ordinary people.

　　Since Chairman Mao and Premier Zhou went to Moscow, the imperialist countries and their running dogs, in a state of desperation, have been spreading rumors. For example, U.S. Secretary of State Acheson said on January 12: "The Soviet Union is merging the northern regions of China." Then he rambled on with a great deal of "supposed" and "rumored" information. Those who have read Director Hu Qiaomu's speech and Soviet Foreign Minister Vyshinsky's statement will have their doubts dispelled. However, it is inevitable that some people who are gullible to rumors will still have some wavering consciousness.

　　Well, since the new treaty and several new agreements were signed, due to the proof of the facts, ordinary people who do not have a deep understanding of internationalism can stop doubting; the imperialist group headed by American imperialism's attempt to sow discord between the friendship of the Chinese and Soviet people has been thoroughly defeated. Who are our enemies and who are our friends can also be clearly distinguished. This is indeed a "great practical proof of the lofty principles of the foreign policy of the Soviet Socialist State." Comparing it with the aggressive treaties or agreements of imperialism, the truth and falsehood are as clear as fire. The reason why the Soviet Union signed treaties like that with the Kuomintang in the past, and why it is signing treaties like this with the Chinese People's Government now; the reason why it wanted to station troops in Lushun and implement joint administration of the Changchun Railway in the past, and the reason why it will immediately withdraw its troops after the conclusion of the peace treaty with Japan, and immediately and unconditionally return all rights of the Changchun Railway and all property belonging to the railway to the Chinese people: this is truly a great brotherly friendship, always thinking of the interests of the Chinese people. This development process is also a reflection of the victorious development of the Chinese people's revolution.

　　This concrete example of internationalism is much more beneficial than reading a few books or listening to a few reports. We must sincerely thank Stalin and Mao Zedong for their good lessons! The imperialist rumor-mongers who sow discord between the friendship of China and the Soviet Union can shut your beaks.

　　我们又上了一次国际主义的政治课
　　罗长培
    一九五○年二月十五日早晨听到广播：中苏友好同盟互助条约和关于长春铁路、旅顺、大连及贷款等协定，十四日在莫斯科同时签字了。
    这是中华人民共和国第一次对外缔结的条约，也是中国近百年外交史上第一次平等互惠的条约。难怪全国人民都欢欣鼓舞，热烈庆祝。
    在一般对于国际主义认识不清楚的人，曾经发生过一系列的问题：人民政府成立后，对于国民党所订的一切条约都否认了，为什么单保留着中苏条约？为什么承认苏联在旅大继续驻兵？为什么长春铁路还要中苏共管？还有人提出一些比较幼稚的问题：我们既然警惕美帝，为什么不怕苏联？我们讲国际主义苏联不讲国际主义怎么办？像这一类的问题，大家经过相当时期的政治学习，凡是懂得从全面看问题，不从片面看问题，或者知道从本质看问题，不从表面看问题的人们，都会了解他们的不正确。可是在一般人的心目中，难免还存着这一类的怀疑。
    自从毛主席和周总理到莫斯科后，帝国主义国家和它的走狗们，在吓得无可奈何的情况下，又在乱造谣言。例如：美国艾奇逊一月十二日曾经说：“苏联正在将中国北部地区实行合并”。随后又“据说”“传闻”地乱扯了一大顿。这种不值一驳的谰言，凡是看过胡乔木署长谈话和苏联外长维辛斯基声明的人们，也都会涣然冰释的。可是还难免有些轻信谣言的人们还会多少存在一些动摇的意识。
    好了，自从这个新条约和几个新协定签字后，由于事实的证明，一般对于国际主义没有深切认识的人，可以不必怀疑了；以美帝为主的帝国主义集团企图挑拨离间中苏两国人民友谊的阴谋已经彻底的失败了。谁是我们的敌人，谁是我们的友人，也可以显然地分清楚了。这的确是“苏维埃社会主义国家外交政策崇高原则的伟大的实际证明”。拿它来和帝国主义的侵略条约或协定对照，真假是非明若观火。苏联当初所以跟国民党那样订条约，现在所以跟中国人民政府这样订条约；当初所以要在旅大驻兵，要对长春铁路实行共管，现在所以要在对日和约缔结后立即把军队撤退，并且立即把长春铁路的一切权利和属于该路的全部财产，无偿的交还中国人民：这真是伟大的兄弟般友谊，处处为中国人民的利益着想。这种发展的程序，也就是中国人民革命胜利发展的反映。
    这种国际主义的具体实例比我们读几本书听几次报告的利益大得多，我们要由衷地感谢斯大林和毛泽东给我们的良好教训！挑拨离间中苏两国友谊的帝国主义造谣者可以闭上你们的鸟嘴了。
