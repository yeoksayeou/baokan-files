　　Connecting Contracts and Collective Contracts in the Northeast Production Record-Breaking Movement
    In the Northeast, state-owned factories and mines are widely signing connecting contracts and, in some cases, piloting collective contracts as part of the production record-breaking movement. The signing of both types of contracts is of great importance for consolidating existing production record achievements and promoting the in-depth development of the production record-breaking movement. Among the enterprises that have already signed connecting contracts are Fuxin Ping'an Coal Mine, Benxi Coal and Iron Company Power Department, Shenyang Weaving Factory, Northeast Wool Weaving Factory, and dozens of other units. Those piloting collective contracts include Shenyang No. 1, 3, and 5 Machinery Factories, Fushun Mining Bureau Open-Pit Coal Mine, Jilin Shixian Paper Mill, and over ten other units, most of which are collective contracts established on the basis of signing connecting contracts. After the above-mentioned factories and mines signed connecting contracts or collective contracts, they achieved many successes in production and repair work. For example, Shenyang Wool Weaving Factory had not completed its production tasks in any month during the six months from May to October last year. After launching the production record-breaking movement in November, the factory signed connecting contracts for the forty-three major and minor processes in the original wool weaving to woolen cloth process in a linked manner. As a result, not only was the quality of the finished products improved, but the production tasks were also exceeded. The past phenomena of unclear responsibilities, mutual blaming, and complaints among workers have been basically eliminated. After a certain department of the Fushun Mining Bureau piloted a collective contract in November last year, it drained the accumulated water in a coal pit that had not been completely drained in three years under Kuomintang rule within one month. An'dong No. 1 Paper Mill signed both connecting and collective contracts in December last year and exceeded its original production task by more than 24% in the same month.
    The signing of connecting contracts is mainly led by the trade union, and its purpose is to overcome the phenomenon of disconnection between departments and processes in a timely manner when the development of the production record-breaking movement is uneven, so that the production records in certain departments can be matched by the corresponding cooperation of relevant departments, and the entire production work can be improved. In factories and mines without production records, the signing of connecting contracts can also closely integrate the production work of various departments and play a role of mutual supervision and guarantee. A collective contract is an agreement signed between the trade union, representing all employees, and the enterprise administration, representing the state, in order to jointly complete and exceed the production plan and implement the principle of taking into account both public and private interests and clarifying responsibilities. Therefore, the two have great differences in scope and content.
    At present, there are generally three situations in the relationship of signing connecting contracts: one is the connecting contracts signed directly between related processes, such as workshops and workshops, groups and groups, which is the main form. Its content has its different focus according to the different needs of each department. For example, when the phenomenon of work stoppage waiting for materials occurs, affecting the normal progress of the entire production, the direct purpose of the connecting contract is to supply raw materials or semi-finished products on time; if the connecting contract is signed because the quality of the previous process is too poor, affecting the work of the next process, then its direct purpose is to require quality assurance; if the connecting contract is signed because the production system is unsound, then its direct purpose is to stipulate temporary discipline to facilitate work. The second type is the connecting contracts signed between direct production departments and indirect production departments, such as the main production workshops of various factories requiring inspection workers to go into small groups to inspect products, requiring repair workers to repair machines in a timely manner, etc. In addition, when workers in some factories sign connecting contracts, they often require the administration to provide certain guarantees, such as welfare undertakings, raw material supply, etc. Although these belong to the scope of collective contracts, they can also be appropriately included before a collective contract is signed for the convenience of production.
    The content of collective contracts piloted in various places generally includes production tasks, administrative guarantee matters, trade union leadership's guarantee matters for all employees, reward and punishment methods, etc., which are more complete than connecting contracts. However, under the circumstances that production quotas and wage systems have not yet been relatively fixed, there are still many difficulties in the universal implementation of this type of contract. In particular, it is still too early to establish formal collective contracts from top to bottom according to the industry system in the current situation in the Northeast. Currently, some factories and mines with a more solid foundation for the production record-breaking movement first sign contracts separately between the trade union and the administration from one workshop or one pit, and then gradually promote them to the entire factory after gaining experience. The time for signing collective contracts is also generally short, ranging from several months for longer ones to one month for shorter ones.
    The methods of signing connecting contracts in various places are mostly based on the production plan determined by the factory management committee, discussed by the trade union, mobilized and brewed among the employees, and propose mutual guarantee conditions for realizing the plan; then the trade union cooperates with the administration to draft the contract, and then submits it back to the employees for discussion. Finally, the trade union committee cooperates with the administrative cadres of the contract signing department to jointly decide and hold a grand signing ceremony. In this way, the entire process of signing connecting contracts becomes a process of fully promoting democracy under unified leadership, mobilizing the enthusiasm of employees, and enabling employees to participate in production management, avoiding the practice of only a few trade union cadres and site directors taking care of everything.
    After the factories and mines sign connecting contracts or collective contracts, the employees have clear goals to strive for and their sense of responsibility is greatly enhanced. The factory leaders should check in a timely manner and help solve specific difficulties to ensure the complete realization of the contract. The trade union can organize stable competitions between workshops and workshops, groups and groups, and individuals and individuals on the basis of the contract, so that the production record-breaking movement can become a more organized and more led movement according to the clear goals of the contract. However, there are also many factories and mines that lack experience in establishing connecting contracts or collective contracts, or do not have enough understanding of the importance of establishing contracts, so that the contracts established are crude and have not achieved the desired results.

### 东北生产创纪录运动中的联系合同与集体合同

　　东北生产创纪录运动中的联系合同与集体合同
    东北各国营厂矿在开展生产新纪录运动中，普遍签订联系合同，有的并在试行签订集体合同。两种合同的签订，对于巩固现有生产新纪录的成果和促进生产新纪录运动的深入发展，都有很大重要性。目前已签订联系合同的企业有阜新平安煤矿、本溪煤铁公司动力部、沈阳织布厂、东北毛织厂等数十个单位。试订集体合同的则有沈阳一、三、五机械厂、抚顺矿务局露天煤矿、吉林石岘造纸厂等十余单位，其中大多数是在签订联系合同的基础上所订立的集体合同。以上厂矿在订立联系合同或集体合同之后，在生产和修复工作上都收到许多成绩。如沈阳毛织厂自去年五月至十月的半年中，每月都未完成过生产任务。十一月间开展生产新纪录运动以后，该厂将原毛织成呢子过程中的大小四十三种工序，连环地签订了联系合同，结果不但提高了成品质量，并超过了生产任务。过去工人间责任不明和互相推诿、埋怨的现象已经基本消除。抚顺矿务局某部，去年十一月间试订了集体合同后，则将国民党统治时抽了三年还没有抽完的煤坑积水于一个月内抽完。安东第一造纸厂于去年十二月订立联系与集体两种合同，同月亦超过原来生产任务百分之二十四强。
    联系合同的签订，主要是由职工会领导进行，其目的是在创造生产新纪录运动发展不平衡的情况下，及时地克服各部门、工序之间脱节的现象，使某些部门中的生产新纪录，得到有关部门的相应配合，并使整个生产工作能够提高一步。在没有生产新纪录的厂矿中，联系合同的签订，亦可使各部门生产工作密切结合，起互相监督保证的作用。集体合同则是工会代表全体职工与代表国家的企业行政之间，为了共同完成与超过生产计划，贯彻公私兼顾、分明职责而签订的契约。因此两者在范围及内容上均有很大区别。
    目前，在签订联系合同的关系上，大体上有三种情况：一种是直接有关工序如车间与车间、组与组之间订立的联系合同，这是主要的形式。它的内容根据各个部门的不同需要有其不同重点。如因发生停工待料现象，影响整个生产正常进行时，联系合同的直接目的，就是为着按时供给原料或半制品；如联系合同是因为发生上一工序质量太差，影响下一工序工作的现象而签订，则其直接目的便是要求保证质量；如果联系合同是因为生产制度不健全而签订，则其直接目的就是要规定临时纪律以利工作。第二种是直接生产部门与间接生产部门之间订立的联系合同，如各厂主要生产车间要求检查工深入小组检查产品，要求修理工及时修好机器等。此外，有些工厂的工人们在订立联系合同时，还常常要求行政上作到某些保证条件，如福利事业、原材料供应等，这些虽然都是属于集体合同范围，但为了便于生产，在没有订立集体合同以前，亦可以适当列入。
    各地试订的集体合同的内容，一般包括生产任务、行政保证事项、工会领导全体职工保证事项、奖惩办法等，比联系合同更要完备。但在生产定额及工资制度还未相对固定的情况下，这种合同的普遍实行尚有许多困难。特别是按产业系统的自上而下的订立正规的集体合同，在目前东北的情况下仍属较早。现部分创造生产新纪录运动较有基础的厂矿，系先从一个车间或一个坑口，由工会与行政单独订立，待取得经验后才逐渐推广到全厂。订立集体合同的时间一般也较短，长者数月、短者一月不等。
    各地签订联系合同的方法，大多是根据工厂管理委员会确定的生产计划，经过工会讨论，在职工中进行动员酝酿，提出实现计划的互相保证条件；然后由工会协同行政拟出合同草案，再交回职工讨论，最后由工会委员会协同签订合同部门的行政干部共同决议，举行隆重的签字仪式。这样，使签订联系合同的整个过程，成为在统一领导下充分发扬民主，发动职工积极性，使职工参加生产管理的过程，避免仅由少数工会干部、现场主任等去包办代替。
    各厂矿在签订联系合同或集体合同后，职工便有了明确的奋斗目标，责任心大为提高。而工厂领导者则应及时检查，帮助解决具体困难，以保证合同的彻底实现。工会可在合同的基础上，组织车间与车间、组与组、个人与个人的稳健的竞赛，使创造生产新纪录运动，依据合同的明确目标，成为更有组织更有领导的运动。但也有不少厂矿对订立联系合同或集体合同的经验不足，或对订立合同的重要性认识不够，使订立的合同粗枝大叶，未收到应有效果。
