    [This Newspaper] News: According to the Hebei Daily News: Under the correct leadership of the administration, the Party, and the Trade Union of Tangshan Steel Plant, the workers have repaired the Bessemer converter, which had been abandoned during the Kuomintang era, after more than three months. After eight tests, it has now been officially put into operation. The characteristic of this furnace is that it can directly convert iron into steel. The furnace body is divided into two parts, inner and outer. The outer part is made of one-third firebricks, and the inner part is made of two-thirds firebricks and one-third silica bricks. It is an acidic furnace that can withstand high heat and uses a blower to force air in. The furnace produces steel very quickly, with one heat every forty minutes, and the steel is of excellent quality and free of impurities.
