　　The Glory of the East Zhangjia Village Branch
　　Yu Like
    Around the New Year, the Communist Party branch of East Zhangjia Village in Nangong County, Hebei Province, wrote a New Year's greeting letter to Chairman Mao, reporting on the village's bumper cotton harvest (the original letter was published on page one of this newspaper on January 7th). This was in response to Chairman Mao's call to "increase production by an inch." Under the specific leadership of the branch's cadres and party members, more fertilizer was applied, cultivation was meticulous, technology was improved, and the general crop yield reached pre-war levels, with cotton yields exceeding pre-war levels. They planted a total of 1,261 mu of cotton, with an average yield of 140 jin per mu, and the highest yield reaching 285 jin, exceeding the pre-war yield by 20 to 30 jin per mu. The quality of the cotton met the standard for the intermediate grade. During the autumn grain collection, Nangong County purchased 50,000 jin of seed cotton from East Zhangjia Village. Party members took the lead in paying first, and within five days, it was successfully sent to the station and into storage, with an extra 1,062 jin delivered. After deducting the village's total public grain quota, 117,070 jin of millet were returned. This letter was broadcast nationwide by Xinhua News Agency, and after it spread to various places, people wrote to the East Zhangjia Village branch to congratulate them.
    After the East Zhangjia Village branch saw their New Year's greeting letter published in the newspaper, they held a village meeting that day to read the newspaper. Then, they received congratulatory letters from the Nangong County Party Committee and responsible comrades from the county government. The letter stated: "Your New Year's greeting letter to Chairman Mao reporting on your production achievements has been published in our Hebei Daily. This is an honor for all of your party members and all of the people, as well as an honor for all of the people and the entire party in the county. We hope that you will do even better in this year's production and become a production banner for the entire county." On the spot, party member Liu Cunyou, non-party member Meng Kunshan, and others requested to write a reply letter to the county, reporting that their village must achieve this year's production plan and strive to become a production model village for the entire county.
    The next day, party members, village cadres, the masses, and drama troupes from nearby villages all came to congratulate them. Guan Cihang, director of the East Guanjia Village Farmers' Association, said to the village cadres of East Zhangjia Village, "This year, you must teach us these good cotton-planting methods! Help our village also increase production."
    Afterward, more and more congratulatory letters arrived, continuously being sent from within the province and from other provinces. Yan Shi, secretary of the Communist Party branch of Yan Shengang Village in Lulong County, Hebei Province, and Yan Zhenpu, a member of the branch committee, congratulated the East Zhangjia Village branch on behalf of all the party members in the village, and told them: "We have decided to work hard to learn from your experience. We are currently carrying out land reform, and after the land reform is completed, we have decided to travel a long distance to your village for on-site learning. You will not refuse, will you!" Song Qiming, a comrade from Nangong County in the political department of a certain division of the Third Field Army of the People's Liberation Army stationed in Shanghai, wrote a letter to the East Zhangjia Village branch on behalf of the soldiers from Hebei Province to congratulate them. The letter was filled with brotherly enthusiasm. They said: "The day before yesterday, we saw your village branch's New Year's greeting letter to Chairman Mao reporting on your production achievements in the Liberation Daily, which sells tens of thousands of copies daily in Shanghai. The more we looked at this letter, the more we loved it, and we couldn't bear to put it down even after reading it three times. The soldiers from Hebei Province and Nangong County all felt that this was their own glory. This is a great encouragement to our troops. Some comrades who were worried about the difficulties of life at home felt that as long as there is production, there is a way, and they no longer worry about their families. ... The encouragement to the industrialists and businessmen here is also very great. They said: 'After reading this letter, we have more confidence in relying on the countryside to crush the economic blockade of American imperialism and the Kuomintang reactionaries.'" Finally, they excitedly proposed: "You actively produce to support us, and we actively train to prepare for the liberation of Taiwan; let us work together to liberate all of China!" Hou Fuqun, the son of Hou Guijin, the secretary of a certain army branch in Sichuan, also wrote a congratulatory letter to his father from his station, and he hoped that his father would work hard to lead everyone in production. He himself must also perform meritorious service in the army and send good news to his family. Other soldiers from the village stationed in Zhuoxian, Beijing, Henan, and other places also wrote letters to their families to congratulate them.
    Zhang Jingchun, director of the Public Security Bureau of Taoyuan County, Hunan Province, also sent a letter to East Zhangjia Village saying: "The Hunan Daily published your village's New Year's greeting letter to Chairman Mao, which is a great encouragement to the farmers in the newly liberated areas here. They know about the lives and production of farmers in the old liberated areas after land reform, and they all say: 'We must also follow the path of East Zhangjia Village.'"
    The East Zhangjia Village branch cherishes these letters very much. Every time a letter is received, it is read in detail to all the party members and non-party masses in the winter school. Everyone is inspired by the letters from all over the country and feels an indescribable excitement. Party member Hou Gui said: "Let's quickly tell the comrades in the letters from all over the country about our production increase plan! I guarantee to exceed the production increase plan." Female party member Liu Cunyou said: "Our village's women's work is not good enough. I am very ashamed to see these congratulatory letters. This year, I must lead all the young and middle-aged women in the village to go to the fields for production, work like men, and make our village's production even better." Many farmers have already proposed that after the spring, the study groups should be turned into production research groups to regularly study production.
    On February 1st, the Nangong County government convened the second session of the county's People's Representatives Conference to discuss this year's large-scale production movement. Deng Tonghai, the village head of East Zhangjia Village, was invited to report on his village's production plan for this year. He told everyone that the masses in his village had realized the importance of improving production technology in summarizing their experiences. When making plans this year, they all proposed to learn technology from production experts. Also, because they had benefited greatly from growing cotton last year, they all wanted to grow more cotton this year. For example, Zhang Lanrong, a military dependent with nine and a half mu of land, plans to plant eight mu of cotton, and has bought more than 500 jin of soybean cake and accumulated five carts of fertilizer, and exchanged a kang (using the old kang earth from the dismantled old kang to use on the land). She also plans to plow the land once in the spring, manage the cotton three times, and cultivate it three times, to ensure that there is no grass in the field, so as to harvest 20 more jin per mu. The village office formulated the village's production plan according to the plans of each household and announced it at the villagers' meeting. The village plans to plant a total of 2,040 mu of cotton, accounting for 72 percent of the village's cultivated land, 779 mu more than last year. The most is to strive for a yield of 300 jin per mu, and the least is to harvest 120 jin, with an average of 160 jin, an increase of 20 jin per mu compared to last year. Specific plans have also been made for applying more fertilizer, diligently managing the fields, and mobilizing women to change work and help each other. Village head Deng Tonghai also told everyone: "Everyone has confidence in realizing this plan." (Attached picture)

　　东张家庄支部的光荣
　　于力克
    新年前夕，河北省南宫县东张家庄中共支部曾写信给毛主席贺年，报告他村棉花丰收的情形（原信刊登于一月七日本报一版）。这是他村响应了毛主席“生产长一寸”的号召，支部干部党员具体领导，多施肥、精耕细作，改进技术，一般庄稼收成达到战前产量，棉花产量超过战前。他们共种棉花一千二百六十一亩，每亩平均产量为一百四十斤，最高的收到二百八十五斤，每亩超过战前产量二、三十斤，棉花质量都够中级标准。秋征时南宫县向东张家庄征购籽棉五万斤。党员带头先缴，不到五天就顺利地送站入仓，还多交了一千零六十二斤。除抵交全村应交公粮外，找回十一万七千零七十斤小米。这封信由新华通讯社广播全国，传到各地后，大家给东张家庄支部写信祝贺。
    东张家庄的支部看到自己的贺年信在报上登出后，当天就召开村民大会读报。接着又送来了南宫县委会和县政府各负责同志的贺信。信上边说：“你们向毛主席报告生产成绩的贺年信，登在咱们的河北日报上，这是你们全体党员和全体人民的光荣，也是全县人民和全党的光荣。希望你们把今年的生产搞的更好，成为全县的生产旗帜。”当场党员刘存友、非党员孟昆山等就要求给县里写回信，报告他村一定要实现今年的生产计划，争取做全县的生产模范村。
    第二天附近各村的党员、村干部、群众、剧团………都来祝贺。东关家庄农会主任关慈航对东张家庄的村干部说：“今年您们得把这些种棉的好办法教给俺！帮助俺村也增产。”
    以后，贺信越来越多，本省的，外省的，接连不断的送来。河北省卢龙县阎深港村中共支部支书阎石、支委阎振普代表全村党员向东张家庄支部贺喜，并告诉他们：“我们决定努力学习你们的经验。目前我们正进行土改，等土改完成后，我们决定不远千里到你村实地学习，你们不会拒绝吧！”远驻在上海的人民解放军三野某师政治部南宫籍的宋齐明同志，代表河北省的战士写信给东张家庄支部贺喜，信上充满着兄弟般的热情，他们说：“前天在上海日销十数万份的解放日报上，见到你村支部向毛主席报告生产成绩的贺年信。这个信我们越看越爱看，连看三遍还舍不得放手。河北省和南宫县籍的战士都感到这是自己的光荣。这对我们部队是一个很大的鼓励，一部分顾虑家里生活困难的同志，感到只要生产就有办法，都不再挂念家了。……对这里的工商业家的鼓舞也很大。他们说：“看了这封信，更增加了我们依靠农村，粉碎美帝国主义和国民党反动派经济封锁的信心。”最后还兴奋地提出了：“你们积极生产支援我们，我们积极练兵准备解放台湾；咱们共同为解放全中国而奋斗吧！”远在四川某军的支部书记侯贵金的儿子侯福群也从驻地给他父亲写贺信，他并希望他父亲努力领导大家生产。他自己也一定要在部队上立功，把喜报传到家里。其他驻在涿县、北京、河南等地的该村战士，也都纷纷写信给家里道喜。
    湖南省桃源县公安局长张景春同志也给东张家庄来信说：“湖南日报上登了你村给毛主席的贺年信，对这里新解放区的农民鼓励很大，他们知道了老解放区土改后农民的生活及生产情形，都说：“咱也要按东张家庄的路走。”
    东张家庄支部很珍贵这些信件。每接到一信，就在冬学上向全村党员与非党群众细读。大家受到各地来信的鼓舞，真有说不出的兴奋。党员侯贵来说：“赶快把咱们订的增产计划告诉各地来信的同志吧！我保证超过增产计划。”女党员刘存友说：“咱村妇女工作不够好，见了这些贺信，我很惭愧，今年一定要带领全村青壮年妇女下地生产，和男人一样劳动，把咱村的生产搞得更好。”许多农民已提出开春后，把学习组变成生产研究组，经常研究生产。
    二月一日南宫县政府召开全县第二届各界人民代表会，讨论今年的大生产运动。东张家庄村长邓通海被邀报告他村今年的生产计划。他告诉大家他村群众在总结经验中体会了改进生产技术的重要，今年订计划时都提出要向生产能手学习技术。又因为去年种棉得利大，今年都要多种棉花。如军属张兰荣，九亩半地，计划种八亩棉，并已买了五百多斤豆饼，和积下五车肥，换了一个炕（用拆下的旧炕土皮上地）。她还计划把地春耕一遍，棉花打整三遍，中耕三遍，保证地里不存草，作到每亩多收二十斤。村公所按照各户的计划，订出全村生产计划，在村民大会上公布。全村计划共种棉二千零四十亩，占全村耕地百分之七十二，比去年多种七百七十九亩。最多的争取每亩收成三百斤，最少也要收一百二十斤，平均一百六十斤，每亩比去年增产二十斤。并作出了多施肥、勤打整及发动妇女变工互助的具体计划。邓通海村长还告诉大家：“这个计划大伙都有信心来实现。”（附图片）
