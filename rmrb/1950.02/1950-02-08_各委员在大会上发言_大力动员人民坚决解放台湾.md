    [This Newspaper Reports] During the five-day first plenary session of the East China Military and Political Committee, following Chairman Rao's report, the heads of various provinces and cities delivered reports on their work situations. Twenty-seven committee members, including Hu Juewen, spoke successively, unanimously endorsing Chairman Rao's report on the work tasks of the East China Military and Political Committee, and providing many constructive supplementary opinions on various specific work tasks. Regarding the issue of liberating Taiwan, all committee members expressed their willingness to make the greatest efforts to mobilize all the people of East China to support the front lines. Committee Member Song Shilun said: The campaign to liberate Taiwan is a glorious and great task. All comrades of the East China People's Liberation Army will certainly accept this task with joy and resolutely struggle to complete this task. Committee Member Xie Xuehong once again called on the people of Taiwan to use the spirit of the "February 28th" struggle to prepare to cooperate with the People's Liberation Army, thoroughly overthrow the reactionary rule of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, and use the past revolutionary spirit of anti-imperialism to completely smash all the aggressive conspiracies of American imperialism. She called on the Taiwan compatriots to turn all hatred into strength, turn the bandits' butcher knives into weapons to eliminate the enemy, and complete the glorious task of liberating Taiwan and liberating all of China. Committee Member Chen Shaokuan believes that in addition to taking the liberation of Taiwan as the first task, it is necessary to quickly build up the navy to defend the coast. Committee Member Ding Chaowu stated that the people of Fujian Province will definitely actively support the People's Liberation Army in crossing the sea to liberate Taiwan.
