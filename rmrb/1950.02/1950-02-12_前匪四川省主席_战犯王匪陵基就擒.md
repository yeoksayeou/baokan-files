Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, 11th: Former bandit Sichuan Province Chairman and war criminal Wang Lingji has been captured. After the end of the Chengdu encirclement battle last year, Bandit Wang, disguised with two adjutants under an assumed name, escaped the dragnet. After fleeing Chengdu, Bandit Wang passed through Qionglai, Pujiang, Danleng, Hongya, Jiajiang, Leshan and other places in western Sichuan, eventually reaching Yibin, dreaming of sneaking out of the mainland to Taiwan. On the morning of the 6th of this month, when boarding the "Yongli" steamer in Jiang'an, he was discovered by the garrison and public security personnel. They immediately pulled him off the boat and asked him: "Wang Lingji, where do you think you're going?" Bandit Wang stammered in panic: "I am not Wang Lingji, my name is Dai Chenming, I am a salt merchant..." At this time, the local people, as well as the liberated former government employees, and his former subordinates, all shouted in unison: "'Wang Lingguan' (a nickname given to Bandit Wang by the people of Sichuan because of his unparalleled brutality), don't try to deny it, who doesn't recognize you?" Bandit Wang could not deny it and had to admit: "I am Wang Lingji." Bandit Wang Lingji is from Leshan, Sichuan, and is 64 years old this year. He successively served as company, battalion, regiment and division commander in Liu Xiang's army. From 1936, he served as the Deputy Commander of the Kuomintang Sichuan Security Force and Commander-in-Chief of the 30th Army Corps. Among the Sichuan warlords, Bandit Wang and Yang Sen were the earliest to rely on Chiang Kai-shek. Due to Chiang Kai-shek’s trust, Bandit Wang was promoted to puppet Jiangxi Province Chairman after the Japanese surrender. From April 9, 1948, he served as Bandit Sichuan Province Chairman. On the day he took office, he arrested and killed a large number of students, creating the famous "April 9th Massacre". When the People's Liberation Army entered Sichuan from the east, south, and north last year, Bandit Wang even more inhumanly slaughtered a large number of Communist Party members and democrats imprisoned in Chengdu Prison and burned the archives.

　　前匪四川省主席  战犯王匪陵基就擒
    【新华社重庆十一日电】前匪四川省主席战争罪犯王陵基，已被捕获。王匪系于去年成都围歼战结束时，带着两个副官，化名改装，漏网脱逃。王匪由成都逃出后，经过川西邛崃、蒲江、丹棱、洪雅、夹江、乐山等地逃抵宜宾，梦想混出大陆逃往台湾。本月六日上午在江安搭乘“永利”号轮船时，被驻军和公安机关人员发现，当即从船上把他拉下来，问他：“王陵基，你想到那里去？”王匪惶恐支吾地说：“我不是王陵基，我叫戴晨明，是盐商……”。这时，当地人民以及被解放了的旧政府职员，还有他的旧部下，都异口同声的叫喊：“‘王灵官’（四川人民因王匪残暴无比而给他取的绰号），你不要辩赖，谁还不认识你？”王匪无法抵赖，只得承认：“我是王陵基。”王匪陵基是四川乐山人，今年六十四岁，历任刘湘部营、团、师长等职。一九三六年起任国民党四川保安副司令，三十集团军总司令。在四川军阀内，王匪与杨森投靠蒋介石最早，由于得到蒋匪的信任，王匪于日本投降后，即被升任为伪江西省主席，一九四八年四月九日起任匪四川省主席。就职当日，即捕杀大批学生，造成有名的“四九惨案”。当去年解放军从东、南、北三面进入四川时，王匪更残无人性地大批屠杀关在成都监狱里的共产党员和民主人士，并烧毁档案。
