　　US Imperialism Plots to Establish Japanese Armed Forces
    MacArthur Presents Yoshida with Secret Memorandum, Plans to Convert Japanese Police into 500,000-Strong Armed Force
    [Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 15th] TASS, 14th, citing a Washington dispatch from Dentsu: Whitney, head of the Japanese Government Affairs Group at MacArthur Headquarters, presented the Japanese government with a secret American memorandum to "reorganize" the Japanese police into an armed force of 500,000 men.

    This plan was drafted by military experts in Washington together with MacArthur, according to the plan for rearming Japan. The new Japanese police will become the core of the future army and will train future officers. The American plan stipulates that 400,000 to 450,000 police officers will be recruited in the first half of this year. This number is more than double the total number of existing national police, railway police, and port police in Japan. The new Japanese police will be organized in the American style and will be trained by American army officers.

    In the memorandum submitted to the Yoshida government, the American authorities put forward a detailed outline for the future locations of troops and training barracks. Most of these barracks will be located in major industrial cities and ports. The new Japanese police will have the same weapons as the American police, including armored vehicles and automatic firearms. The new police will include personnel specially selected from the national police, railway police, port police, and former Japanese army. In addition to military training, these new police officers will also receive special training courses.

    The American memorandum submitted to the Yoshida government also stated that the American military authorities stationed in Japan have been ordered to closely monitor the measures taken by the Japanese government to implement the American plan. The Japanese government has been bluntly required to notify MacArthur Headquarters of the progress of rearmament at any time.

　　美帝阴谋建立日武装
    麦克阿瑟向吉田提秘密备忘录  拟把日警编为五十万武装部队
    【新华社北京十五日电】塔斯社十四日引电通社华盛顿消息：麦克阿瑟总部日本政府事务组组长惠特奈，向日本政府提出把日本警察“改编”为五十万人的武装部队的美国秘密备忘录。
    这个计划系由华盛顿军事专家与麦克阿瑟一起根据重新武装日本的计划起草的。新的日本警察将成为未来军队的核心，并将训练未来的军官。美国的计划规定：在今年上半年，将征募警察四十万至四十五万人。这个数字超过日本现有的国家警察、铁路警察及港口警察总数的一倍。新的日本警察将仿效美国的方式组织，并将由美国陆军军官训练。
    美国当局在提交吉田政府的备忘录中，对于部队及训练营房的未来所在地，提出了详细的纲要。这些营房大部将设在各大工业城市与港口。新的日本警察将有和美国警察一样的武器，包括装甲车和自动火器。新警察中将包括特别从国家警察、铁路警察、港口警察与前日本陆军中选出的人员，这些新警察除了受军事训练之外，还有特别的训练课程。
    美国提交吉田政府的备忘录并称：驻日美国军事当局，已奉命密切注视日本政府为履行美国的计划而采取的措施。日本政府已被直言无讳地要求随时把重新武装的进展情况通知麦克阿瑟总部。
