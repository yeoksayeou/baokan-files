　　Over the Past Year, Several State-Owned Enterprises in the Capital
    Have Deviated from Entrusted Processing and Ordering
    Leadership Should be Strengthened So That Private Factories Can Adapt to the Needs of Economic Construction
    [This Newspaper News] Reporter Feng Zhong reports: In the past year, state-owned enterprises and government agencies in Beijing have greatly supported private factories through entrusted processing and ordering, achieving great success; however, many problems have also arisen.
    Entrusted processing and ordering by public enterprises have played a significant role in the restoration and development of Beijing's private industry. Over 90% of factories in the weaving and dyeing industry process woven cloth for the Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company. 43% of the production of the mechanized flour industry is processed for the Grain Company. 52 machine and iron industries factories are processing and manufacturing waterwheels for the Water Conservancy Promotion Society of the Ministry of Agriculture. In addition, many large and small factories are manufacturing approximately 1,000 tons of orders for the Materials Bureau of the Ministry of Railways, resolving difficulties in raw materials, sales, and capital turnover. The entrusted processing and ordering of the Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company, the Grain Company, and other units are relatively systematic and planned. Although some deviations have occurred, they have been promptly corrected. Due to their specialized business, various professional companies have gradually understood the situation of relevant industries. If they can strengthen cooperation with the Municipal Bureau of Industry in the future, and if the Bureau of Industry assists in supervision and inspection with administrative power, the work will surely improve further.
    Bidding Methods Lead to Malpractice;
    The Profits from Orders and Processing are Unbalanced and Unreasonable
    However, some state-owned enterprises and government agencies, when implementing entrusted processing or ordering, neither have correct cost accounting nor understand the other party's production capacity and product quality. Moreover, they often blindly invite bids and choose contractors based solely on "ability to do" and "cheap price." As a result, some private factories reduce profits to the minimum on the surface in order to win the bid, but skimp on materials and workmanship during the process, or substitute inferior goods. The profits obtained by the contractors are sometimes too high and sometimes too low. Last year, both the Materials Bureau of the Ministry of Railways and the Water Conservancy Promotion Society of the Ministry of Agriculture placed orders or entrusted processing to various machine and iron factories. The profits given to the factories by the Materials Bureau of the Ministry of Railways for pipes, water cranes, screws, etc., were generally 30% to 40%, and sometimes as high as 60%. However, the profit for the Water Conservancy Promotion Society's entrusted processing of waterwheels was at most 20%. As a result, factories rushed to take orders from the Materials Bureau of the Ministry of Railways and were unwilling to work for the Water Conservancy Promotion Society. Some even took on the waterwheels of the Water Conservancy Promotion Society and then took on the work of the Materials Bureau of the Ministry of Railways, which resulted in the waterwheels not being delivered on time. The high profits given by the Materials Bureau of the Ministry of Railways tempted some factories with poor technology and equipment to take on more work in pursuit of high profits. For example, some small factories contracted to make screws for the Materials Bureau of the Ministry of Railways and even hammered the screw heads with large hammers, which was both time-consuming and poorly done. Some factories could not deliver on time, which affected the completion of the task. Moreover, the situation of layer-by-layer transfer and exploitation also occurred. In August of last year, a typical event occurred. The Materials Bureau of the Ministry of Railways ordered spikes and entrusted them to the state-owned North China Machinery Company's Beijing Machinery General Factory, with a price of 6.5 liang of millet per piece. The Beijing Machinery General Factory of the North China Machinery Company transferred the order to the public-owned Zhenhua Iron Factory for 300,000 pieces. The first batch of 100,000 pieces was priced at 6 jin of millet per piece; the second batch of 200,000 pieces was reduced to 4 jin per piece. In one transfer, the Beijing Machinery General Factory earned 49,375 jin of millet. However, the Zhenhua Iron Factory only made 110,000 pieces itself. The remaining were supplied with raw materials and subcontracted to several private factories, with a price reduction to 30 yuan per piece (initially estimated by the Materials Bureau of the Ministry of Railways to require 1 jin of millet to process one, which was equivalent to 200 yuan at the time). Among them, Longmao Iron Factory alone contracted 90,000 pieces. However, Longmao had no equipment and could not do it at all, so it subcontracted it to six or seven small factories such as Heji, reducing the price to 25 yuan per piece. Finally, it was subcontracted to more than 20 small factories. A total of five transfers were made. The profits given by the Materials Bureau of the Ministry of Railways were exploited layer by layer. The final contractors received very little. In addition, the small factories had poor technology and poor raw materials, and some even got the drawings wrong. The Ministry of Railways paid a high price, but many of the goods received were unusable. In addition, Yixin and other iron factories also subcontracted some of the orders from the Materials Bureau of the Ministry of Railways. Some were even transferred to public factories to do.
    In early February of this year, the Tianjin Railway Bureau invited bids for various rubber tubes, but only the name and quantity of the products were stated during the bidding, and no specifications for the raw materials were provided. Originally, there were many types of rubber materials and the thickness and type of canvas used to manufacture rubber tubes. For one type of rubber tube, the price difference between the two rubber factories in Beijing, Xinhua and Qixin, was as much as one time. The lowest bidder won the bid, but the quality standard was not guaranteed. In January of this year, the Beijing Water Company ordered the casting of water pipes. The quotation from factories in Beijing was approximately 5,000 jin of millet per ton, while a iron factory in Taiyuan quoted only 3,700 jin of millet per ton. After investigation, it turned out that the iron factory's equipment was insufficient.

    Continuous Inspection Should be Conducted After Ordering
    The second major problem is that there is no detailed investigation before ordering and no timely inspection afterwards. Beijing Chunji Iron Factory, which had never made screws before, contracted to manufacture 60,000 screws for the Materials Bureau of the Ministry of Railways. When the first batch of goods (10,000 pieces) was delivered on November 1st last year, the Materials Bureau of the Ministry of Railways carelessly accepted them without detailed inspection. Chunji thought that the goods were "qualified" and continued to manufacture the remaining 50,000 pieces in the same way. The goods were delivered successively and accepted until the end of December when all 60,000 pieces were delivered. The Materials Bureau of the Ministry of Railways then noticed the inspection because many screws sent to other places were unusable. As a result, about 30,000 of the 60,000 screws made by Chunji were unusable and returned for repair. Of the 30,000 pieces contracted by Dazhong Iron Factory, 8,270 pieces were also returned. Chunji used all its strength to repair the screws. Starting from the beginning of February, there were still 17,000 pieces unfinished by February 22nd, which was detrimental to both the public and private sectors.
    Last May, the North China Water Conservancy Promotion Society of the Ministry of Agriculture placed orders for waterwheels in private factories. It also failed to conduct sufficient investigations of the contractors in advance and failed to conduct inspections at any time afterwards. As a result, some factories delayed delivery by two or three months. Some factories produced shoddy goods, and the finished products did not meet specifications. Now, some waterwheels are still piled up in the warehouse and cannot be used. Later, the Society cooperated with the Bureau of Industry to educate a small number of factories (such as Xingji, Haiquan, etc.) that violated the contract. In the subsequent contracts, the Society first asked the factories to produce samples, and then entrusted them with processing after the samples were inspected and qualified. For manufacturers who undertook the work for the first time, the Society inspected the first finished product immediately after it was made, and then ordered them to continue manufacturing if they were qualified, to ensure that they met the specifications. Their experience is: "Order less, deliver frequently, and inspect more." That is, when entrusting processing or ordering, it is advisable to order less, and require the factories to deliver frequently and continue to sign processing contracts at any time. Orders should not exceed their production capacity. Continuous inspections should be carried out during the manufacturing process, and experienced workers should be sent to the factories to provide technical guidance.

    It is Necessary to Closely Contact the Bureau of Industry to Jointly Inspect and Supervise
    Based on the above situation, public enterprises should first investigate and understand the production capacity and technical equipment of each factory when looking for private factories to process or order goods. Then, they should decide which items should be assigned to which factories and how much they can do. In particular, more accurate cost accounting should be done in advance, and the profits given should not be too high, but it must be guaranteed that each factory can obtain legitimate profits. From the time the factories start work, inspections and supervision should be carried out at any time to prevent shoddy workmanship and delayed delivery. Only in this way can the public and private sectors both benefit, truly achieving public support for the private sector, and enabling private industry to play its due role in national economic construction. If public enterprises cannot understand the production situation of each private factory for the time being and do not have timely supervision and inspection, it is best to obtain appropriate contact with the competent department of the Municipal Government - the Bureau of Industry when entrusting processing or ordering, and to understand the situation of some private factories through the Bureau of Industry. Administrative power should be obtained to assist in inspection and supervision. Based on the cost accounting of each unit and the specific circumstances at the time, the profits from processing and ordering of each unit should be gradually unified. If one factory cannot complete the task, it should be planned to distribute it to several factories to do it, so as to avoid one factory being busy and many factories being idle, and to avoid the phenomenon of transferring and subcontracting, and layer-by-layer exploitation.

### 一年来首都若干国营企业  委托加工定货发生偏向  应加强领导私营工厂适应经济建设需要

　　一年来首都若干国营企业
    委托加工定货发生偏向
    应加强领导私营工厂适应经济建设需要
    【本报讯】记者冯仲报道：去年一年间，北京的国营企业和政府机关，以委托加工及定货的方式，扶助私营工厂，获得很大成绩；但也发生很多毛病。
    公营企业的委托加工与定货，对于北京市私营工业的恢复与发展曾起了很大作用。织染业中百分之九十以上的工厂给花纱布公司加工织布。机制面粉业生产品中的百分之四十三是粮食公司的加工品。机器铁工业有五十二个厂给农业部水利推进社加工制造水车。另有许多大小厂子制造铁道部材料局约一千吨的定货。解决了原料、销路及资金周转上的困难。花纱布公司、粮食公司等单位的委托加工与定货，是比较有系统有计划的。虽曾发生过若干偏差，但都已及时纠正。各专业公司由于业务专一，已逐渐了解了各有关行业的情况。今后如能加强与市工业局的配合，并由工业局以行政力量协助监督检查，工作必能提高一步。
    招标方法发生弊病  定货加工利润不平衡不合理
    但有些国营企业和政府机关实行委托加工或定货，自己既无正确的成本计算，又不去了解对方的生产能力和产品质量。且往往盲目地招标承做，选择的标准只是“能作”及“廉价”。这样，一些私营工厂为了中标，表面上将利润减至最低限度，而在承做中偷工减料，或用劣货顶替。承做的工厂，所得利润有的过高，有的很低。去年铁道部材料局与农业部水利推进社都曾向各机器铁工厂定货或委托加工。铁道部材料局定的管子、水鹤、螺丝等，给各厂家的利润一般地是百分之三十至四十，有的高达百分之六十。而水利推进社委托加工造水车的利润最高是百分之二十。这样，各厂就抢着作铁道部材料局的定货，不愿作水利推进社的活。有的是在揽了水利推进社的水车之后，又揽了铁道部材料局的活。结果影响水车不能如期交货。铁道部材料局给的利润高，使有些技术差、设备不好的工厂，为了追逐高额利润，勉强多揽活。比如有些小厂承揽铁道部材料局定造螺丝钉的活，竟用大锤打螺丝帽，既费工夫又做不好。有的厂子则到期交不了货，影响任务的完成。而且，层层转手剥削的情形也发生了。去年八月间曾发生过这样一件典型事件。铁道部材料局定造穿钉，交给国营华北机器公司北京机器总厂承做，价格是六斤五两小米一个。华北机器公司北京机器总厂转给公营振华铁工厂制造三十万个。第一批十万个，价格是每个小米六斤；第二批二十万个，每个减至四斤。一转手间，北京机器总厂赚得小米四九三七五斤。但振华铁工厂自己只做了十一万个。其余由它供给原料，分给几个私营工厂加工。每个三十元（最初据铁道部材料局估价是加工一个需一斤小米，当时合二百元）。其中隆茂铁工厂一家就承做了九万个。但隆茂没有设备，根本做不了，便又分给合记等六、七个小厂去造，价格减至每个二十五元。最后又转包给二十多家小厂。先后共转了五道手。铁道部材料局给的利润，都被层层剥削了。最后承造者的所得实已无几。再加上小厂技术不好，原料不好，有的甚至连图样子都搞错了。铁道部出了高价，收到的货品却有许多不能用。此外，义信等铁工厂承造铁道部材料局的定货，也有一部分转手包出去。甚至又曾转到公营工厂去做。
    今年二月初，天津铁路局以招标方式定造各种橡胶管，但招标时只说出了品名、数量，而没有规定用什么样的原料。本来制造橡胶管用的胶料及帆布的粗细，种类很多。有一种胶管，北京的新华、企新两家橡胶厂递价相差竟达一倍。投标价小的中标了，但质量标准却没有保证。本年一月，北京自来水公司定铸水管，向北京的工厂定货则约需五千斤小米，太原有一家铁工厂递价每吨仅三千七百斤小米。经调查，原来该铁工厂设备不够。
    定货之后应不断检查
    定货之前没有详细调查，事后又不及时检查，这是第二个大毛病。从未造过螺丝的北京纯记铁工厂，给铁道部材料局承造了六万个螺丝，去年十一月一日第一批交货（一万个）时，铁道部材料局未详细检查即马虎收下。纯记以为货品“合格”了，其他五万个都照样造下去，陆续交货都被收下，直至十二月底六万个交齐后，铁道部材料局因为许多螺丝发到外地去不能用，才注意检查起来。结果，纯记所造六万个螺丝中，约有三万个不能用，退回重修。大中铁工厂承造的三万个也退回八千二百七十个。纯记用全部力量重修螺丝，自二月初开始，到二月二十二日还有一万七千个未修完。弄得公私两不利。
    农业部华北水利推进社去年五月在私厂定购水车，对承铸的工厂也是事先调查不够，事后又未随时检查，以至有些工厂交货误期达两三个月之久。有些厂粗制滥造，成品不合规格。现在还有一部分水车堆在仓库里不能用。后来该社便与工业局配合起来，对违反合同的少数工厂（如邢记、海泉等）进行教育；并在以后订合同时，先由各厂造出样子，经检查合格后，再委托其加工。对初次承造的厂家，造出第一件成品后立即检查，合格时再令其继续制造，保证合乎规格。他们的经验是：“少定，勤交，多检查”。即委托加工或定货时，不妨少定，而要求各厂勤于交货，随时继续订立加工合同。定货不可超过其生产能力。在各厂制造时要不断检查，并派有经验的工人到各厂进行技术指导。
    要和工业局密切联系协同检查与监督
    根据以上情况，公营企业找私营工厂加工或定货，首先应该调查了解各厂的生产能力与技术设备，然后决定那一种物品分配给那一些厂子做，而且能够做多少。尤其是事先要有较精确的成本计算，给予的利润不应过高，但要保证各厂均能得到合法的利润。从各厂开始动工时起，就要随时检查监督，防止偷工减料，以及误期交货等情形发生。只有如此，才能公私两利，真正作到公营扶助私营，使私营工业在国家经济建设上发挥应有的作用。如果公营企业一时还不能了解各私营工厂生产的情况，又没有随时监督检查，那么在委托加工或定货时，最好能与市政府主管部门——工业局取得适当联系，经过工业局了解一些私营工厂的情况。并在检查监督上取得行政力量的协助。根据各单位成本计算和当时具体情况，逐步地统一各单位加工定货的利润。如果一个厂子不能完成，即应有计划地分配给几个厂子去做。免得一个厂子忙，许多厂子闲；也免得发生辗转包活，层层剥削的现象。
