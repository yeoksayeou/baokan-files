　　If It's Reasonable, Persist
　　Tianjin Zhongfang No. 1 Factory CCP Branch
    Obviously, the acceptance of something new in life is not a spontaneous, self-generating process, but is formed in a tense and continuous struggle. To support something new, to encourage it with all our strength, and to provide it with all the conditions for growth and formation is the business of every Bolshevik, and especially the business of every Party leader.
    Comrade Stalin called the sense of the new a noble quality of every Bolshevik worker.
    —Excerpt from Soviet Dorkunov: "A Sense of the New is a Noble Quality of Bolsheviks."
    In the Qinghua (Cleaning and Opening) Department of the Tianjin Zhongfang No. 1 Factory's yarn factory, each Qinghua machine had to supply 10,000 spindles for the back spinning process. In the past, it took three people a whole day to wipe one large machine in the maintenance department. Therefore, the operation department often couldn't supply cotton laps to the carding department, so they had to work overtime.
    In December of last year, when making the plan for 1950, Communists Gao Zhenghua and Shen Xueming from the Qinghua Maintenance Department discussed an improvement method together. They advocated increasing the number of people wiping the machines from three to five, and reducing the wiping time from a whole day to half a day. Although the number of people increased by two, the time was saved by half. The wiped machine could still run for half a day. By implementing this plan, more Qinghua cotton laps could be added to meet the needs of the carding department.
    They decided to make a suggestion to the technician. However, the technician disagreed. Because this would increase the number of people wiping the machines, and the maintenance department only had six people in total. It was impossible to add people, so the technician would have to do it himself. He wasn't happy about this. At the same time, he thought that it had never been done this way before, so it was impossible. The technician said, "I can't take care of it," and pushed it to the technician. So, Shen Xueming and Gao Zhenghua went to the technician again. Who knew that the technician also disagreed.
    Shen Xueming and Gao Zhenghua explained the suggestion to the technician again and again: "Doing this is good, the maintenance department can improve efficiency, ensure the cotton supply of the operation department, and thus strengthen the unity of the two departments." But the technician said: "Our maintenance department takes care of itself! We don't care about the operation department." They said, "The maintenance department and the operation department are not separated!" The technician said again: "Doing this will not meet the machine maintenance standards." They guaranteed "can do as stipulated by the technician." They requested three times in a row, and finally the technician still said, "If you want to do it, do whatever you want!" Shen Xueming said, "How can we do whatever we want? If you don't agree, of course we can't do it privately." This matter was put on hold.
    Shen Xueming and Gao Zhenghua, fearing that they would make a subjective mistake, also sought the opinions of the workers in the maintenance department. Everyone agreed and also discussed the division of labor. But the matter was not approved for a long time, and some people got angry and said, "We are so active, but you pour cold water on us." Gao Zhenghua and Shen Xueming were not anxious or discouraged, and they made a fourth suggestion. Finally, they got the technician's approval.
    Under the leadership of the two, the workers in the maintenance department actively started to work. Five people wiping a machine, sure enough, completed it in half a day. After two days, they felt that there were still too many people, and four people were enough.
    In this way, both the technician and the technician were a little surprised. In the past, it took three people a whole day to wipe a machine, but now four people only need half a day, saving one-third of the labor. Where is the truth? It turned out that they implemented a method of precise calculation. In the past, they would unload the machine in the morning and install it again in the evening, procrastinating day after day. Now, however, before they started, they would inspect the machine first and calculate the time and division of labor accurately. When they started, no one wasn't sweating profusely, and no one easily let go of a second.
    As a result of their work, the operation was even happier. Because of this change, they could make 80 more cotton laps every day and supply the carding department without working overtime. The operation department was very grateful to the maintenance department for their help, and the two departments naturally became more united. The technician of the maintenance department also examined his own conservatism at the meeting.
    Although this is a small improvement, it is related to the production of the whole factory, because it is equivalent to increasing the cotton supply of 5,000 spindles per day. Party members Gao Zhenghua and Shen Xueming were therefore rewarded. (Picture attached)

　　合理的就要坚持
　　天津中纺一厂中共支部
    显然，一种新鲜的事物，在生活中被接受，并不是自流地、自发地，而是在紧张的、不断的斗争中形成的。扶植一种新鲜的事物，以一切力量鼓舞它，给与它以一切生长和形成的条件，这便是每一个布尔什维克的业务，尤其是每一个党的领导人的业务。
    斯大林同志把对新鲜事物的感觉，称之为每一个布尔什维克工作人员的高贵品质。
    —摘自苏联多尔库诺夫：《对新鲜事物的感觉是布尔什维克的高贵品质。》
    天津中纺一厂纱厂清花部，每部清花车要供后纺一万锭子。过去，保全部擦一部大车，三个人要一整天的时间。因此，影响到运转部常常供不上梳棉部的棉卷，于是只好加点。
    去年十二月份，订一九五○年的计划，清花保全部的共产党员高正华，沈学明在一起商量了个改进办法。他们主张擦车人数由三人增加到五人，擦车时间由一整天减到半天。虽然增加两个人，时间却节省了一半。擦完的车还有半天时间能转动。实行这一计划，清花棉卷加多了，才能供得上梳棉部。
    他们决定向技术员提出建议。但是，技术员却不同意。因为这样作擦车人数要增多，而保全部一共才六个人，添人不可能，就得技术员自己亲自下手来作。这一点他心里不乐意。同时他认为从来没有这样作过，这是不可能的。技术员说“我管不着”，他推给了技师。于是，沈学明高正华又去找技师。谁知技师也不同意。
    沈学明、高正华把这个建议，再三向技师解释：“这样做是好的，保全部既可提高效率，又能保证运转部的供棉量，并且因此可以加强两部的团结。”但技师却说：“我们保全部顾保全部得啦！运转部咱不管。”他们说：“保全部运转部不分家呀！”技师又说：“这样做于机器保全不合格。”他们保证“可以照技师规定的做。”他们一连要求了三次，最后技师还是说“你们要做，随便吧！”沈学明说“怎能随便呢？你们不答应，我们当然不能私下做。”这件事情就被搁下了。
    沈学明高正华怕自己犯主观主义的错误，又征求了保全部工友们的意见。大家都很同意，还讨论了分工的办法。但事情老批不准，有人就生气了说“我们这样积极，你们倒泼冷水。”高正华、沈学明也不发急，也不泄劲，他们又去作第四次的建议。终于得到技师批准了。
    保全部工人在他们俩的带动下，积极动起手来。五个人擦一部车，果然半天就完成了。过了两天，他们觉得人还多，只要四个人就够了。
    这样，技师、技术员都不免有些惊异。从前擦车三个人得一整天，现在四个人只要半天节省了三分之一的工。这道理在那里呢？原来是他们实行了精确计算的办法。过去，早上卸下机器，晚上再按，一天一天磨磨蹭蹭的。现在却不然，他们在动手以前先检查机器，精确地计算时间和分工。动起手来，没有谁不是满头大汗，没有谁轻易放过一秒钟。
    他们这样做的结果，运转上更是高兴。因为这样一改，每天能多做八十个棉卷，不用加点，就供上梳棉部了。运转部很感谢保全部对他们的帮助，两部之间自然就团结得更好。保全部的技师在这个会上，也检讨了自己的保守主义思想。
    这虽是件小改进，但却关系全厂的生产，因为这等于增加五千锭子一天的供棉量。党员高正华、沈学明因此受到了奖励。（附图片）
