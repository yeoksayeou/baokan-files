Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, February 2nd: The broad masses of the American people live in suffering. According to a TASS dispatch from New York on January 30th: Millions of Americans do not have access to medical services. Due to the particularly low living standards of the working people and the lack of adequate medical services, infant mortality rates and the percentage of miscarriages are very high. In black neighborhoods and Puerto Rican neighborhoods, the majority of women still give birth at home, without medical assistance and in unsanitary conditions.

The Compass newspaper recently published official figures describing the living conditions in several areas of New York (these figures only reflect a portion of the true situation), proving the daunting misery of this metropolis. In one area of Manhattan (on Manhattan Island, the center of New York), out of 5,609 infants, at least 150 were miscarried, and at least 25 out of every thousand infants lived only a few days. In another area, the number of miscarriages was about twice as high as in Manhattan, and 47 out of every thousand newborns died soon after birth.

The health conditions of older children are also very poor. In the United States, ten million children suffer from eye diseases, and more than one million children suffer from ear diseases. About 40 percent of children need general treatment, but only a small portion of them receive irregular medical assistance.

Children in many cities and regions of the United States live in even worse environments than New York. The People's World newspaper of San Francisco wrote about the terrible situation of children in California, stating that many residents in the Bakerfield and Hanford areas work on plantations. The children there wear tattered clothes and sleep on the ground. Due to malnutrition and hunger, the mortality rate is particularly high.

The extreme need for security for the future forces Americans to commit extremely serious crimes. Suicides due to poverty also occur frequently in the United States. For example, Amarela, a Florida house decorator, shot his wife and three children before committing suicide. According to newspaper reports, in his suicide note, he wrote about the difficulties of material life and the hopelessness of finding a job.

Freeman, a worker living in Kalamazoo, returned home to find his wife holding a blood-stained knife. His son's body was lying on the ground, and Freeman found the body of his second child in the bedroom. Desperate poverty forced this woman to commit this terrible crime. All American newspapers are filled with this kind of news.

　　美国广大人民生活悲惨  千万儿童缺乏医药救助
    绝望的贫困迫使母亲杀死孩子
    【新华社北京二日电】美国广大人民生活在苦难中。据塔斯社纽约一月三十日电：数百万美国人享受不到医药服务。由于劳动人民的生活水准特别低和缺乏充足的医药服务，幼童的死亡率和流产的百分率非常高。在黑人住区和波多黎各人住区，仍有大多数妇女在家中分娩，并且是在没有医药援助和不卫生的情况下分娩的。
    指南针日报最近发表官方的数字，描述纽约若干地区的生活状况（这些数字只反映出真实情况的一部分），证明了这一大都市的令人生畏的惨况。在曼哈坦（在曼哈坦岛上，为纽约的中心）的一个地区的五千六百零九名婴孩中，至少有一百五十名是流产的，而一千名婴孩中，至少有二十五名只活数天。在另一个地区，流产的数目比曼哈坦约高一倍，每千名刚出生的婴孩中，有四十七名在出生后很快就死了。
    年龄较大的儿童的健康状况，也是很坏的。美国有一千万儿童患眼病，一百多万儿童患耳病。约有百分之四十的儿童需要一般治疗，但其中只有很小的一部分得到不正规的医药救助。
    美国许多城市与地区的儿童，生活在甚至比纽约还要糟的环境中。旧金山的人民世界报撰文描述加利福尼亚州儿童的可怖境遇称，在贝克菲尔德与汉福德两地的许多居民区，其居民是在种植园中工作的。那里的儿童穿着破烂的衣服，在地上睡觉。由于营养不良和饥饿，死亡率特别高。
    对于明日安全的极度需要，迫使美国人去犯极严重的罪。因贫穷而自杀的事件，在美国也层出不穷。例如佛罗里达州的装璜房屋的工匠阿马莱拉，在枪杀了他的妻子和三个小孩后，然后自杀。据报纸报道，在遗书里，他写到物质生活的困难和寻找职业的无望。
    住在卡拉马簇镇的工人佛利曼，回家时看到他的妻子拿着沾满血污的刀。他的儿子的尸体躺卧地上，佛利曼在寝室里又发现他的第二个孩子的尸体。绝望的贫困迫使这个妇人犯了这一可怕的罪行。所有美国报纸都载满了这一类消息。
