Jiangxi's Chongren, Fuliang, and Other Counties
    Formulate Grain Depot Protection Measures to Prevent Loss of Public Grain
    [This newspaper reports] Since the latter part of last month, the grain bureaus and warehouses in Chongren, Fuliang, Yujiang, and Gaoan counties in Jiangxi have begun educating cadres and organizing the masses to carry out grain depot protection work. The party and government leading organs and the grain bureau of Chongren County, after joint research and discussion, formulated ten grain depot protection measures. In addition to stipulating that all warehouse personnel should be educated to recognize the importance of their work, live up to the trust of the people, and not be allowed to be perfunctory or lazy, the measures also stipulate that the surrounding houses and walls of the warehouse should be checked at any time, and if there are any places that are too short, collapsed, or insecure, they should be repaired immediately; moisture and water should be prevented, and the grain entering the warehouse should be inspected once every three days to prevent fever, mold, rodent theft, and insect infestation; it is strictly forbidden to place firewood and other flammable materials near the warehouse. In addition, it is stipulated that mass meetings should be held in the location of the warehouse to carry out publicity and education, explain the importance of protecting the warehouse, and educate everyone to love the property of their motherland, so as to realize true mass supervision and collective warehouse protection. Because the fifth sub-warehouse of the Fuliang County Grain Bureau was full of grain reserves, it borrowed nearby civilian warehouses, which were dispersed and difficult to manage. It specially mobilized the masses near the warehouse to organize a public grain warehouse protection group, formulated a joint covenant for warehouse protection, and called on the masses to be vigilant, prevent fire and theft, and strictly prevent sabotage by lawbreakers. The masses of the eighth Bao in Yujiang County's urban area, in order to protect the warehouse and prevent sabotage by special agents and bandits, spontaneously organized a self-defense team to protect state property; the grain collection director served as the captain, and patrolled on shifts every night. When the Zhuhu Village Central Warehouse in the fifth district of Gaoan was being built, the leading cadres did not conduct in-depth inspections of the warehouse construction work, and the contractor used the warehouse construction funds for personal gain, cutting corners, causing the warehouse to collapse during the grain delivery upsurge, resulting in a great loss of public grain. Later, in order to strictly protect the warehouse and improve the sense of responsibility of the warehouse personnel, a specific warehouse protection plan has been formulated to prevent the loss of public grain.

　　江西崇仁浮梁等县
    订出护仓办法防止公粮损失
    【本报讯】江西崇仁、浮梁、余江、高安等县粮食局及仓库，自上月下旬起已开始教育干部组织群众进行护仓工作。崇仁县党政领导机关及县粮食局，经过共同研究商讨，订出十项护仓办法。该办法中除规定要教育全体仓库人员认识自己工作的重要，不负人民的委托，不许敷衍偷懒外，并规定：要随时检查仓库周围房屋墙壁，如有过矮、塌坏或不牢之处，应即修理；要防水防潮，入库之谷三天即须检查一次，以防发热，发霉、鼠盗、虫蚀；在仓库附近严禁置放柴草及易燃之物。此外并规定须召开仓库所在地群众大会，进行宣传教育，说明保护仓库的重要，教育大家热爱自己祖国的财产，以实现真正的群众监督，集体护仓。浮梁县粮食局第五分仓库因备粮已满，借用附近民仓，分散不易管理，特发动仓库附近群众，组织保护公粮仓库小组，订出护仓共同公约，并号召群众提高警惕、防火防盗、严格防止不法分子破坏。余江县城区第八保群众，为了保护仓库，防止特务匪徒破坏，自动组织自卫队保护国家财产；由征粮主任委员担任队长，每晚轮班警戒。高安五区珠湖村中心仓库在建库时，因领导干部对建库工作深入检查不够，工头利用建仓费营私，偷工减料，致使仓库在送粮热潮中倒塌，损失公粮甚大。后为了严密保护仓库，提高仓库人员责任心，已拟定具体护仓计划，免致公粮损失。
