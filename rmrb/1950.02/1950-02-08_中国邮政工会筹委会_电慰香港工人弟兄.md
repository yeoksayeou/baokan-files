　　Preparatory Committee of the Chinese Postal Workers' Union
    Sends Telegram of Condolence to Hong Kong Workers
    [Beijing News] The National Preparatory Committee of the Chinese Postal Workers' Union sent a telegram on the 6th to express its condolences to the Hong Kong tram workers and protest against the British Hong Kong government's unreasonable shooting of workers. The telegram reads as follows: To the Hong Kong and Kowloon Federation of Trade Unions, and to the worker brothers in Hong Kong:
    Your actions in demanding reasonable improvements in treatment in order to protect your minimum living standards in the face of high prices are entirely justified. The British Hong Kong government not only refuses to accept your reasonable demands, but also uses violent means to carry out armed suppression against you, causing this bloody tragedy, for which the Hong Kong government should bear full responsibility.
    We, on behalf of the postal workers of China, express our extreme anger at the British Hong Kong government's unreasonable shooting of workers, causing a major bloody tragedy, and lodge a serious protest! In addition to expressing our brotherly warm condolences to you, we are willing to resolutely support you with all our strength and act as your backing!

　　中国邮政工会筹委会
    电慰香港工人弟兄
    【北京讯】中国邮政工会全国筹委会于六日致电慰问香港电车工人，并抗议香港英政府无理枪击工人的暴行。电文如下：港九工人联合会转香港的工人兄弟们：
    你们在物价高涨下为了保障最低生活而要求合理的改善待遇的行为是完全正当的。香港英政府不但不接受你们这一合理的要求，反而施用暴力手段向你们实行武装镇压，造成这一流血惨案，应由香港政府负全部责任。
    我们代表中国的邮政工人对香港英政府的无理枪杀工人，造成重大流血惨案的暴行，表示异常的愤怒，并提出严重抗议！除向你们表示兄弟般的热烈慰问外，并愿坚决以全力支援你们，作你们的后盾！
