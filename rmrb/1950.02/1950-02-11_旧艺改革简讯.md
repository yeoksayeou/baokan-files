　　Brief News on the Reform of Traditional Arts
    [Report from our newspaper] The training class for traditional opera performers, sponsored by the Beijing Municipal Bureau of Culture and Education's Art Department, has achieved considerable success since its establishment. After studying, the trainees are eagerly seeking to absorb new content and new forms into the art they practice. In order to strengthen the reform of traditional opera music, the Art Department specially invited the Beijing People's Art Theater to perform Chinese musical pieces at the Democratic Theater on the 6th for observation and study. More than 800 people attended, most of whom were traditional opera actors and musicians. In addition to performing Chinese musical pieces such as "New Life in the Mountains," "Blooming Red Flowers," "The East is Red," and "New Democratic March," the Mongolian folk song "Senjitema" and Mozart's "Serenade" were also performed, allowing the audience to compare, analyze, and study them.

　　旧艺改革简讯
    【本报讯】北京市文教局文艺处主办的旧剧艺人讲习班，自成立以来，已获相当成绩。经过学习，学员们迫切要求在自己从事的艺术上吸收新内容和新形式。为加强旧剧音乐的改造，文艺处六日特请北京人民艺术剧院在民主剧院演奏中国乐曲，以资观摩研究。到有听众八百多人，其中多半是旧剧演员和搞音乐的人。会上除演奏了中国乐曲“山中新生”、“开红花”、“东方红”、“新民主进行曲”等外，并演奏了蒙古民歌“森吉德马”和莫札尔特的“小夜曲”，使听众可以比较分析和研究。
