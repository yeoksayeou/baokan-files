　　"Introduction to the Administrative Divisions of North China Region" Errata
    I. In Shanxi Province, the "eight" special districts should be corrected to "seven" special districts, because the Yicheng Temporary Special District was abolished on December 31, 1949. The original six counties were respectively assigned to the leadership of the Changzhi, Linfen, and Yuncheng special commissioner's offices (Qinshui County was assigned to Changzhi Special Commissioner's Office; Huo County, Fushan, and Yicheng counties were assigned to Linfen Special Commissioner's Office; Jiang County and Yuanqu counties were assigned to Yuncheng Special Commissioner's Office).
    II. Daokou Town, directly under the Puyang Special District of Pingyuan Province, has recently been transferred to the leadership of Hua County. Pingyuan Province no longer has any directly administered towns.
    III. Suiyuan Province has a total of 22 counties. Dongsheng County was omitted from the list of county names.
    IV. The "27" special districts under the jurisdiction of the five provinces in North China Region should be corrected to "26" special districts, and the "seven" directly administered towns should be corrected to "six" directly administered towns.

　　“华北区行政区划介绍”勘误表
    一、山西省辖“八”个专区应改为“七”个专区，因翼城临时专区已于一九四九年十二月三十一日撤销，原属六县，分别划归长治、临汾及运城等三个专署领导（沁水县归长治专署；霍县、浮山、翼城三县归临汾专署；绛县、垣曲二县归运城专署领导）。
    二、平原省濮阳专区直辖之道口镇，于最近改由滑县领导，平原省已无专辖镇。
    三、绥远省共辖二二个县，县名内遗漏东胜县。
    四、华北区五省分辖“二七”个专区，应改为“二六”个专区，“七”个专辖镇应改为“六”个专辖镇。
