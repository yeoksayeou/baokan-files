Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, January 31st: The Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government recently promulgated the "National Tax Policy Implementation Guidelines." The full text is as follows:

The Central People's Government, in order to unify national tax policies, establish a new tax system, and strengthen tax work, convened a National Tax Conference in Beijing in November 1949. Based on the general policy spirit of Article 40 of the Common Program, "The state's tax policy should be based on the principle of ensuring the supply of the revolutionary war, taking into account the restoration and development of production and the needs of national construction, simplifying the tax system, and implementing reasonable burdens," the following twelve articles of the "National Tax Policy Implementation Guidelines" are formulated:

	I.	To implement the 1950 budget, it is necessary to strengthen tax work and establish a unified tax system.

	II.	The burden on farmers far exceeds the burden on industrialists and businessmen. To make the burden fair and reasonable, the urban and rural burdens should be appropriately balanced based on the principle of reasonable burden.

	III.	The tax policies, tax types, tax items, and tax rates implemented across the country are extremely inconsistent. They should be quickly sorted out and gradually implemented in the short term to achieve national tax policy unification.

	IV.	The National Tax Conference provisionally designates the following taxes as central and local tax revenues:

	(1)	Commodity Tax
	(2)	Industrial and Commercial Tax (including business tax and income tax for resident merchants, itinerant merchants, and peddlers)
	(3)	Salt Tax
	(4)	Customs Duties
	(5)	Salary and Remuneration Income Tax
	(6)	Deposit Interest Income Tax
	(7)	Stamp Tax
	(8)	Inheritance Tax
	(9)	Transaction Tax
	(10)	Slaughter Tax
	(11)	Real Estate Tax
	(12)	Land Tax
	(13)	Special Consumption Behavior Tax (banquets, entertainment, cold food, hotels)
	(14)	License Plate Tax

	V.	Provisions regarding tax legislation:

	(1)	All national tax regulations and laws shall be uniformly formulated, promulgated, and implemented by the Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government. All regions shall conscientiously comply with and implement them. If there are any opinions, they may be suggested to the central government for consideration. Before the central government makes revisions, no modifications or changes shall be made without authorization.

	(2)	The detailed implementation rules for all national tax regulations shall be uniformly formulated by the central tax authorities and implemented with the approval of the Ministry of Finance. The regional tax administrations may formulate tax collection methods based on the spirit of the tax laws and regulations promulgated by the central government and implement them with the approval of the financial departments of the large administrative regions.

	(3)	Legislation concerning local taxes within the scope of a county shall be drafted by the county people's government and submitted to the provincial people's government for review and transfer to the people's government or military and political committee of the large administrative region for approval, and reported to the central government for record; those within the scope of a province (city) shall be drafted by the provincial (city) people's government and submitted to the people's government or military and political committee of the large administrative region for review and transfer to the central government for approval.

	VI.	Each region should grasp different tax priorities based on different tax revenue situations. Tax revenue leading agencies at all levels should focus on urban tax revenue and pay attention to the timing and seasonality of tax revenue and the timely return of cash to the treasury to ensure payments and stabilize finance.

	VII.	Paying taxes is the glorious duty of the people. A patriotic concept of complying with regulations and paying taxes should be established among the people. Tax workers should strengthen the connection between the government and the people, enhance revolutionary qualities, and adhere to the fine tradition of hard work and simplicity.

	VIII.	All state-owned enterprises shall pay taxes in accordance with regulations, with independent enterprise funds as the unit, and pay taxes to the local tax authorities. Cooperatives should also pay taxes to the state without exception.

	IX.	Foreign nationals and the enterprises they operate must abide by the laws of the People's Republic of China and pay taxes in accordance with regulations.

	X.	Regarding cases of violation of tax laws and tax policies, the tax authorities may impose penalties and conduct education in accordance with regulations; abuse of penalties and confiscation are strictly prohibited.

	XI.	Tax authorities at all levels across the country are subject to the dual leadership of the higher-level bureau and the government at the same level. The director of the tax bureau may attend the administrative meetings of the government at the same level.

	XII.	Provisions regarding several important systems:

	(1)	Tax authorities at all levels must establish a strict system of requesting instructions and reporting.

	(2)	Tax authorities at all levels must strictly implement the tax payment reporting system and remit funds to the treasury on time. In areas with banks, a treasury system should be implemented to promptly absorb tax revenue into the treasury.

	(3)	Tax authorities at all levels should establish accounting, invoice, reporting, inspection, reward and punishment, meeting, and learning systems.

	(4)	Tax authorities at all levels must establish a statistical system and attach importance to investigation and research work. The focus should be on industrial and commercial conditions, the level of tax burden, and the impact of tax policies on various economies.
