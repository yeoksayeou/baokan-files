　　Rejecting Federal Court's Temporary Strike Ban
    US Coal Miners Persist in Strike
    Steel Industry Production Reduced Due to Coal Shortage
    [Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, February 26th] The 372,000 coal miners of the United Mine Workers of America, who began their strike in early January, are refusing to obey the temporary strike ban issued by the federal court and the back-to-work order issued by the union leader Lewis, and are continuing their strike. 10,000 workers in Illinois belonging to the Progressive Mine Workers of America also joined the strike at midnight on the 21st, expressing their support.
    According to the United Press, after the US Federal Court Judge Gies's two temporary strike bans issued on the 11th failed to achieve the purpose of getting the miners back to work, he further ordered the coal miners' union to have its members return to the mines by the 24th. The order stated that if they did not comply, the union would be summoned on the 27th, found guilty of "contempt of court," and fined heavily. The US government is attempting to undermine the workers' strike by weakening the union's funds.
    Miners have expressed widespread indignation at the US government's use of this means of suppression. Despite the court's threat to try the union for "contempt of court," emotionally charged miners are still prepared to continue the strike until a new contract is signed.
    The coal miners' persistent strike to win reasonable wage and welfare increases has already dealt a serious blow to the US capitalist economy. According to a United Press report on the 24th, if the strike continues unresolved, "the US steel industry, automobile industry, and other heavy industries will soon fall into a state of complete paralysis." The Inland Steel Company has already reduced production by 55% due to coal shortages. In addition, authorities in ten US states have been forced to adopt coal rationing and implement partial dimming of lights.

　　拒绝联邦法院临时罢工禁令
    美煤矿工人坚持罢工
    钢铁工业已因缺煤产量减低
    【新华社北京二十六日电】一月初开始罢工的美国联合煤矿工人工会的三十七万二千煤矿矿工，拒绝服从联邦法院的临时罢工禁令和该工会领袖路易斯的复工令，仍在坚持罢工中。伊利诺斯州的属于进步煤矿工人工会的一万工人，也于二十一日午夜参加罢工，表示支援。
    据合众社消息，美国联邦法院法官吉兹在他十一日所发布的两道临时罢工禁令均未能达到使矿工复工的目的后，又进一步命令煤矿工人工会在二十四日以前使会员返回煤矿工作。该命令声称，如不遵令，将在二十七日传讯工会，判处“蔑视法庭罪”，课以巨额罚金。美国政府企图借削弱工会基金，来达到破坏工人罢工的目的。
    矿工们对美国政府使用此项镇压手段，已发生普遍愤慨，尽管法院威胁要审讯工会“蔑视法庭罪”，但情绪激昂的矿工，仍准备继续罢工，直至签订新合同时为止。
    由于煤矿工人为争取工资与福利金的合理增加而坚持的罢工，已经使美国资本主义经济遭受严重的打击。据合众社二十四日消息称，如果罢工继续不能获致解决，“美国的钢铁工业、汽车工业及其他重工业不久将陷入全部瘫痪的状态”。美内陆钢铁公司已因缺煤而减少生产百分之五十五。此外，美国有十个州的当局，已被迫采取煤炭配给制度和施行部分灯火放暗管制。
