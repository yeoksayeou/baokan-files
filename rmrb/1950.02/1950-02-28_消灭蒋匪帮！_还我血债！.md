　　Eliminate the Chiang Kai-shek Bandit Gang! Repay My Blood Debts!

    The establishment of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance and its related agreements coincides with our commemoration of the third anniversary of the February 28th Revolution in Taiwan, which holds great and special significance.
    Three years ago today, the people of Taiwan, in order to resist the Kuomintang Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang’s cruel rule—political oppression and economic exploitation—rose up themselves, fighting with their lives and blood against the Kuomintang Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang to strive for democracy and freedom. This heroic behavior is worthy of admiration and sympathy from our compatriots in the motherland. Taiwan compatriots should remember the happy mood when Japan surrendered. After more than fifty years under the cruel and dark rule of Japanese imperialism, they wholeheartedly believed that they were liberated, returning to the embrace of the motherland, and from then on could enjoy freedom, democracy, and happiness. However, contrary to their wishes, the Kuomintang Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang’s cruel and dark rule not only did not lessen compared to the rule of Japanese imperialism, but even intensified. The Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang’s methods of discrimination, oppression, exploitation, and slaughter of Taiwan compatriots left every Taiwanese with no way to survive. The occurrence of the "February 28th" Revolution was a righteous action of self-defense by Taiwan compatriots forced to rise up by the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang. Although it did not succeed, it has awakened the attention of the people of the world and compatriots throughout the motherland, especially making Taiwan compatriots clearly recognize the hideous face of the Kuomintang Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang supported by U.S. imperialism in this incident.
    Three years have passed, and the entire world's camp of peace and democracy has undergone great changes. First, the Chinese people, under the leadership of their great leader, Chairman Mao of the Chinese Communist Party, fundamentally defeated the Kuomintang reactionary rule, driving the remnants of the Kuomintang Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang out of mainland China. Taiwan has become the last place for the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang to struggle. The number one traitor Chiang Kai-shek attempts to rely on U.S. imperialist planes and warships to bomb Chinese people's cities and block our sea ports in order to hinder our production and construction. The Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang妄想wants to hold onto Taiwan, waiting for the Third World War to cooperate with the enemy to counterattack the motherland. Therefore, all the most reactionary heads of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, like blood-sucking demons, have concentrated in Taiwan. They want to use the lives and property of six and a half million Taiwan compatriots as a last-ditch effort for their counter-revolutionary war against the motherland. U.S. imperialism is also using all its power, under the guise of relief, through the Economic Cooperation Administration, to strengthen its monopoly over all of Taiwan's resources and plunder of all agricultural products. At the same time, under the bloody rule of Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang secret agents and police, Taiwan compatriots constantly suffer the cruel lives of arrest, imprisonment, torture, and strangulation. Taiwan compatriots are now in the midst of the double oppression and exploitation of U.S. imperialism and the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, suffering inhuman treatment that is even worse than it was three years ago. Therefore, liberating Taiwan is a common task for the people of the motherland and Taiwan compatriots this year.
    We have confidence in liberating Taiwan. Just as the world revolution leader Comrade Stalin said, truth and justice are on our side. We have the sympathy and support of the majority of the people in the world, especially the establishment of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance, which marks the unity of the irresistible forces of peace and democracy of the seven hundred million people of China and the Soviet Union, sharing life and death together. We have one hundred and twenty million percent confidence in the victory of liberating Taiwan. Let U.S. imperialism and its running dog Chiang Kai-shek tremble before us!
    Taiwan compatriots, strengthen our confidence in the victory of the revolution, maintain the glorious tradition of the "February 28th" Revolution, organize all revolutionary forces, unite all patriotic democratic people, under the leadership of the Taiwan Democratic Self-Government League, participate in and support all revolutionary activities in an open or secret manner. At the appropriate time, coordinate with the People's Liberation Army's attack on the motherland.
    Taiwan compatriots, the blood debts of three years ago have now reached the time to repay them with blood! Rise up! Catch the number one traitor Chiang Kai-shek, eliminate the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, and establish "immortal merit" to commemorate the third anniversary of the "February 28th" Revolution!
          February 24, 1950, at the Ministry of Internal Affairs in Beijing

### 消灭蒋匪帮！  还我血债！

　　消灭蒋匪帮！  还我血债！
　　陈其瑗
    正在中苏友好同盟互助条约及其协定成立，我们来纪念台湾二·二八革命运动三周年，是有其伟大而特殊的意义的。
    三年前的今天，台湾同盟们为了反抗国民党蒋匪帮残酷的统治--政治上的压迫经济上的剥削，自己起来以生命热血与国民党蒋匪帮搏斗，争取民主自由，这种英勇的行为是值得祖国同胞所钦佩与同情，台湾同胞应记得日本投降时的愉快心情，经过五十多年在日帝的残酷黑暗统治，满心以为得到解放回到祖国怀抱，从此可以享受自由民主幸福。然而事与愿违，国民党蒋匪帮的残酷黑暗统治，不独不比日帝统治减轻而且加甚。蒋匪帮对于台湾同胞的歧视压迫剥削屠杀手段，使得每个台胞没有方法再活下去。“二·二八”革命的发生是蒋匪帮逼迫台湾同胞们起来自卫的正义行动，虽然没有成功，但已唤起全世界人民全祖国同胞的注意，尤其是使得台湾同胞在这次事件中认识清楚美帝所支持的国民党蒋匪帮的狰狞面目。
    时间已过了三年，整个世界和平民主阵容已有大大改变。首先是中国人民在自己伟大领袖中国共产党毛主席领导之下根本上打垮了国民党反动统治，把国民党蒋介石残余匪帮驱逐出于中国大陆以外，台湾变成了蒋匪帮最后挣扎的地点。头号卖国贼蒋介石企图倚靠美帝的飞机、军舰，轰炸中国人民的城市封锁我们的海口，来阻扰我们的生产建设。蒋匪帮妄想保住台湾、等待第三次世界大战时配合敌人来反攻祖国。因此一切吸血魔鬼似的蒋匪帮中最反动的头子都已集中到台湾去。他们要以六百五十万台湾同胞的生命财产供其对祖国反革命战争作孤注一掷。美帝亦以其全力假借救济的名义，通过经合总署，来加强对台湾的一切资源的垄断和一切农产品的掠夺。同时在蒋匪帮特务警察血腥统治之下，台湾同胞经常身受逮捕坐牢拷打绞杀的惨酷生活。台湾同胞现在处于美帝蒋匪帮双重压迫与剥削水深火热之中，所受非人的待遇，比诸三年前更有过之而无不及。因此摆在我们面前，解放台湾是祖国人民与台湾同胞今年共同的任务。
    我们对于解放台湾是有信心的。正如世界革命导师斯大林同志所讲真理和正义是在我们这一方面。我们有世界上大多数人民的同情与支援，特别是中苏友好同盟互助条约的成立，标志着中苏两国七万万人民的不可抵抗的和平民主力量团结在一起，生死与共。我们对于解放台湾的胜利是有百二万分的把握，让美帝及其走狗蒋介石在我们面前发抖罢！
    台湾同胞们，加强我们对革命胜利的信心，保持“二·二八”革命的光荣传统，组织一切革命力量，团结一切爱国民主人士，在台湾民主自治同盟的领导之下，以公开的或秘密的方式，参加与支援一切革命活动。到适当时机，配合祖国人民解放军的进攻。
    台湾同胞们，三年前的血债，现在已到了用血来偿还的时候了！起来吧！捉住头号卖国贼蒋介石，消灭蒋匪帮，建立“不世之功”来纪念“二·二八”革命三周年！
          一九五○年二月二十四日于北京内务部
