Tibetan People Yearn for the People's Liberation Army
    Visiting Tibetan Representatives from Xikang  Bai Sheng
    The three Tibetan representatives from Xikang, who had traveled a long distance to Beijing, were all figures from the era of the "Boba Government" of Xikang. "Boba" means Tibetan people. The "Boba Government" was created in 1934. At that time, China's great People's Army, then known as the Red Army, helped the Tibetan people of Xikang organize their own government in Ganzi, with the assistance of Commander-in-Chief Zhu, during the 25,000-li Long March.
    The oldest of them is Cai Liang, who is already fifty years old this year, but still so strong. The other two are Wang Jia and Bo Zhi. Bo Zhi had studied at the Mongolian and Tibetan School in the interior and can speak Mandarin; Wang Jia and Cai Liang can only speak Tibetan. Wang Jia can also write good Tibetan.
    Our conversation was translated by Bo Zhi and Pengcuo Zhaxi, another Tibetan who had recently arrived in Beijing from Qinghai.
    Wang Jia introduced us to the situation during the "Boba Government" era. The "Boba Government" was very weak when it was first established. It was an organization similar to a guerrilla team. This government had worked hard to enable poor Tibetans to turn themselves around. The Red Army stayed in Ganzi for two months at that time, and the relationship with the local Tibetans was very good; until after leaving Ganzi, the Tibetans, feeling this noble and great friendship, automatically protected many wounded soldiers of the Red Army. Since then, the "Boba Government" has continued to lead progressive Tibetans in persisting in the struggle against the reactionaries. For more than ten years, they have been missing the People's Army, eagerly inquiring about the news of the Red Army, and spreading the heroic stories of the Chinese Communist Party and the Chinese Red Army among the Tibetans. Not long ago, Lanzhou and Xining were liberated. When the news reached Xikang, the Tibetans were as happy as if they had already been liberated. As a result, the desire to be truly liberated also boiled over.
    This simple man Wang Jia, who writes good Tibetan, also described to us the current living conditions of the Tibetan people. He said that the production of the Tibetan people has been stagnating in a very backward state. The Kuomintang reactionaries colluded with British and American imperialists to invade Kang and Tibet, which caused great pain and oppression to the Tibetan people. Therefore, the Tibetan people's demand for liberation is extremely urgent. At present, most of the Tibetans are still living a nomadic life, living by water and grass, but some Tibetans are also living an agricultural life. They eat tsampa, which is made by stir-frying highland barley and mixing it with ghee, and drink brick tea boiled with cow dung. In addition, lamas also have the lifestyle of lamas. The Tibetan people have no industry at all except for a very small handicraft industry. Under the oppression and rule of the reactionaries, the economy of the Tibetan people cannot develop, their lives are in an extremely backward state, and of course culture is difficult to improve.
    However, Wang Jia said firmly that the Tibetan people, under the leadership and help of the Central People's Government and Chairman Mao of the Chinese Communist Party, will be able to overcome backwardness, eliminate national discrimination, expel the aggressive forces of British and American imperialism, and achieve true liberation. Moreover, we can also develop the resources of Kang and Tibet and build a new Kang and Tibet for the people through labor and production with the unity and cooperation of the people of all ethnic groups.
    When they secretly set off for Beijing this time, Kang and Tibet had not yet been liberated. Now, Xikang has been liberated, and the liberation of Tibet is just around the corner. This belief of the Tibetan compatriots will be fully realized. Wang Jia said gratefully that they received the warm hospitality and welcome from the liberated Chinese Han people and the leaders of the Party, government, and army in various places. He said that this made them deeply realize that the Tibetan people and the Han people and the people of the whole country are always connected by flesh and blood and are inseparable. Only by uniting closely can the Tibetan people no longer be subjected to imperialist aggression and oppression. Only under the wise leadership of Chairman Mao and the Chinese Communist Party can the people of all ethnic groups live in harmony in a big family and live a happy life.
    Today, in the days of the great victory of the People's Liberation Army, their hearts are filled with unspeakable joy and excitement, and they have met Commander-in-Chief Zhu again. They recalled that sixteen years ago, they first met this amiable old man on the grasslands of Xikang. They now represent all the Tibetans in Xikang to come to the people's capital to tell Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu about the Tibetan people's infinite remembrance of the Communist Party and the People's Liberation Army and the Tibetan people's desire for liberation for more than ten years.

　　藏族人民渴念解放军
    访西康来京藏民代表  柏生
    和记者握手的三位刚从西康远道跋涉抵京的西康藏民代表，都是西康“博巴政府”时代的人物。“博巴”就是藏民的意思。“博巴政府”是产生于一九三四年。那时候，中国伟大的人民军队，当时称为红军，在二万五千里长征路上，由朱总司令帮助西康藏民在甘孜组织了藏民自己的这个政府。
    他们之中最老的一个是蔡良，今年已经五十岁了，但仍是那么健壮。另外两位是汪嘉和伯志。伯志曾在内地蒙藏学校读过书，会说国语；汪嘉和蔡良都只会说藏语。汪嘉并能写一手好藏文。
    我们的谈话是由伯志和另一位新近方由青海抵京的藏民彭措扎西担任翻译的。
    汪嘉为我们介绍着“博巴政府”时代的情景。“博巴政府”初成立时，力量是很薄弱的。那是一个类乎游击队的组织。这个政府，曾努力要使穷苦的藏民能够得到翻身。那时的红军在甘孜住了两个月，和当地的藏民相处的感情非常好；直到离开甘孜后，藏民感于这种崇高伟大的友谊，都自动地把红军的许多伤员保护起来。此后，“博巴政府”继续领导着进步的藏民，坚持与反动派作斗争。十余年来，他们一直在怀念着人民的军队，热切地打听着红军的消息，并在藏民中传播着中国共产党和中国红军的英勇故事。不久以前，兰州和西宁解放了，消息传到西康，藏民们欢喜得如同自己已经解放一样。因之，迫切盼望自己真正获得解放的心也沸腾了。
    这位写得一手好藏文的质朴人物汪嘉，又为我们叙说着目前藏族人民的生活情形。他说，藏族人民的生产一直停滞在十分落后的状态。国民党反动派勾结着英美帝国主义来侵略康藏，这使藏族人民受着极大的痛苦和压迫。因此藏族人民要求解放是极为迫切的。目前藏民大部仍是过着游牧生活，逐水草而居，但也有一部分藏民是过着农业生活。他们吃的是用青稞炒熟的糌粑搅上酥油，喝的是用牛粪烧火煮开的砖茶。此外喇嘛还有喇嘛的生活方式。藏族人民除了有很小的手工业外，根本没有工业。在反动派的压榨统治下，藏民的经济不能发展，生活陷在极落后的境地，当然文化也就很难得到提高。
    但是，汪嘉坚定地说，我们藏族人民在中央人民政府和中国共产党毛主席的领导与帮助下，是能够克服落后、消灭民族歧视驱逐英美帝国主义的侵略势力，而获得真正的解放。并且我们还能够在各民族人民团结协力下，用劳动生产来开发康、藏的富源，建设人民的新康、藏。
    他们这次秘密动身来京时，康、藏都还没有解放。现在，西康已经解放，西藏的解放也就在眼前了。藏族同胞的这种信念将要全部地实现了。汪嘉曾感激地说，他们受到了解放后的中国汉族人民和各地党政军领导人对他们的热情款待与欢迎。他说，这使他们深深地体会到藏族人民和汉族人民及全国人民，永远是血肉相连不可分的。只有紧密地团结，才能使藏族人民不再受帝国主义的侵略与压迫。只有在毛主席和中国共产党的英明领导下，各民族人民才能和乐共处在一个大家庭中，过着幸福的生活。
    今天，在人民解放军伟大胜利的时日，他们心里充满着说不出的喜悦与兴奋，再一次地会到了朱总司令。他们回忆着，十六年前，在西康大草原上，第一次见到过这位和蔼的老人。他们现在代表着全西康的藏民来到人民的首都，要向毛主席和朱总司令倾诉藏族人民十余年来对共产党和解放军无限的怀念和对藏族人民解放的渴望。（附图片）
