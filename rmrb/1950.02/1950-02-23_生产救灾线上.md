　　On the Production and Disaster Relief Front

　　干部带头 (Cadres Take the Lead)
　　In Xinhe Township, Bohai Old Liberated Area, the female deputy township head, Yang Juying, personally pushed two hundred catties of grass to Tang Yu to sell to the river workers, exchanging it for more than thirty catties of coarse grains in two trips. The masses' initial concerns that it would be unprofitable were completely dispelled. They all said:
　　"Who knew that cutting grass to sell could really be so lucrative? Now we have to work hard to cut it!" At this time, with her appeal, she smoothly organized thirty-two carts to push grass for sale.
　　When the cadres of Kangzhuang Township mobilized the masses to fish, no one paid attention either. Comrade Li Zhongxue of the CCP District Committee led several people to fish in a pond and caught more than one hundred catties of fish, exchanging it for more than one hundred and fifty catties of grain. Three fishing groups were immediately organized.
　　查灾 (Disaster Investigation)
　　In Hukou Township, Suining and Yaoji District, Jiangsu Province, Yang Yuzhang, the CCP Township Secretary, went to Mazhuang to investigate the disaster. He saw Shao Kaiwen and his wife crying non-stop and asked them why. Shao said: "Our family really has no way to think, we sold our four-year-old boy to someone else, and the child is about to leave with them, how can people not be sad...". Comrade Yang Yuzhang immediately convened a village cadre and mass meeting to discuss this matter. Comrade Yang Yuzhang explained that "farmers all over the world are one family", everyone should help each other and find a way for Shao Kaiwen's family. Shao Kaiyang immediately expressed his willingness to lend five sheng of beans to Shao Kaiwen's family to make tofu for sale. Then they discussed how the households in difficulty could produce and save themselves. Liu Benshan first said: "I will take out six dou of grain as capital to organize mutual aid to process vermicelli." Then twenty-four middle and poor peasants signed up, taking out a total of four shi, two dou, and five sheng of grain, and together with the families of martyrs, soldiers, and disaster victims such as Shao Kaiwen and other seven families, they divided into three groups and jointly planned to process vermicelli.
　　献土方 (Donating Earthwork)
　　The Xiuhe Brigade in Xin'an County, Jiangsu Province, voluntarily donated 13,200 cubic meters of earthwork, with wages totaling more than 89,500 catties of grain, all of which had been donated for disaster relief. At that time, under the influence of cadres and Party and Youth League members taking the lead, major brigades, from top to bottom, from within the Party to the laborers, carried out deliberation; at the Wangzhuang Brigade's CCP branch meeting, one hundred and ten Party members proposed to donate a total of one hundred cubic meters of earthwork. Another ninety-four Youth League members donated eighty-eight cubic meters of earth. Laborers from all townships competed to sign up to donate earthwork, and a mass voluntary earthwork donation campaign for disaster relief was widely launched in major brigades.
　　立义仓 (Establishing Charity Granaries)
　　Some slightly affected and non-disaster areas in Guanyun and Huaiyin counties in northern Jiangsu Province are actively carrying out a saving-for-disaster-relief campaign and establishing collective charity granaries. According to incomplete statistics from fourteen townships in Tongxing District, Guanyun, more than 54,600 catties of turnips, more than 300 catties of coarse grains, more than 600 catties of radish leaves, and more than 700 catties of sweet potato chips have been accumulated. When donating, the masses in various places showed a high degree of enthusiasm for disaster relief. For example, Li Hengcai of Taishan Village said: "When we are full, we must think of when we are hungry. In the past, when we had disasters here, the government shipped grain from other places by boat to help us. Now that we have food and clothing, we should always remember the disaster victims in other places."

    干部带头
    渤海老舍区新河乡，女副乡长杨菊英，亲自推了二百斤草到唐豫卖给河工，两趟换回杂粮三十多斤。起初群众认为无利可图的顾虑，便完全打消了。他们都说：
    “谁晓得割草卖真能有巧头，这会可要下劲揪呀！”这时候，她一号召，便顺利地组织了三十二挂小车推草卖。
    康庄乡干部动员群众?鱼时，也是无人睬理。中共区委李中学同志领导几人先?了一个塘，?到一百多斤鱼，换回粮食一百五十多斤。三个?鱼组立刻便组织起来了。
    查灾
    江苏省睢宁、姚集区湖口乡，中共乡书杨玉章往马庄查灾，见邵开文夫妇哭泣不止，问他们为什么？邵说：“咱家真没法子想，把个四岁男孩儿卖给了人家，孩儿马上就要跟人家走了，怎能教人不伤心……”。杨玉章同志便立即召开村干和群众大会，讨论这件事，杨玉章同志说明“天下农民是一家”，大家应互助互济、替邵开文家想办法。当场就有邵开扬表示愿借给五升豆子让邵开文家做豆腐卖。接着又讨论了困难户如何生产自救，刘本善首先说：“我拿出六斗粮做本钱，组织互助拐粉。”接着又有中、贫农二十四户报名，共拿出四石二斗五升粮，伙同烈、军属和灾户邵开文等七家，分成三个小组，合伙计划拐粉。
    献土方
    江苏省新安县修河大队，义务劳动共献土方一万三千二百公方，工资合粮八万九千五百多斤，已全部献作救灾用。当时，在干部和党、团员带头的影响下，各大队由上而下，由党内到民工进行酝酿；王庄大队中共支部大会上，便有一百一十个党员，提出共献土方一百公方。另有九十四个青年团员，献八十八公方土。各乡民工都争先报名献土方，各大队广泛地掀起了群众性的义务献方救灾运动。
    立义仓
    苏北灌云、淮阴两县部分轻灾和非灾区乡，积极开展节约救灾运动，成立集谷义仓。据灌云同兴区十四个乡的不完全统计，已陆续积起葫萝卜五万四千六百多斤，杂粮三百多斤，萝卜缨子六百多斤，山芋干七百多斤。各地群众在募献时，都显示出高度的救灾热情。如太山村李恒才说：“我们饱时要想到饿时，过去咱们这儿有灾荒，政府从别处用船运粮来救济咱们，咱们现在有吃穿了，也应该时刻记着别处的灾民”。
