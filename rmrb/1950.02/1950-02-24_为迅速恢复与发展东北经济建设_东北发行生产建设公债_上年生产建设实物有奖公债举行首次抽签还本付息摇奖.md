Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 23rd: The Northeast People's Government, in order to rapidly restore and develop Northeast economic construction, and with the approval of the State Council of the Central People's Government, has decided to issue 30 million shares of the 1950 Northeast Production and Construction Indexed Bonds. The Northeast People's Government issued an order and regulations on the issuance of construction bonds on the 15th of this month. The raising, repayment of principal, and payment of interest on these bonds are calculated based on physical goods. The unit is designated as "share," with a total of 30 million shares. The first tranche is 17 million shares, scheduled to be issued starting March 1st; the issuance time for the second tranche will be determined separately. Each bond share is calculated based on the total market price of five *jin* of sorghum rice, one *chi* of Five Blessings Cloth, five *jin* of refined salt, and thirty-four *jin* of raw coal in Shenyang City. The Northeast Bank will calculate and announce these prices on the 1st, 11th, and 21st of each month based on the previous ten days' prices, as the standard for receiving and paying bond funds. The bonds will be repaid in five installments over five years, with a lottery drawing held annually starting in 1951. The first drawing will repay 10% of the total amount, and each subsequent drawing will increase by 5% of the total amount until the fifth drawing repays the remaining balance. The bond interest rate is set at 5% per annum, also calculated based on physical goods, with interest paid annually. These bonds are not allowed to be used as currency or pledged to national banks.

Since the Northeast had already issued a production and construction bond last year, which played a significant role in stabilizing financial prices and increasing economic construction strength, the general public has widely recognized the benefits of purchasing bonds. Therefore, when the Northeast People's Government passed the above decision at the political affairs meeting on January 27th, it was warmly supported by the people of Northeast China. The Shenyang Municipal People's Political Consultative Conference has convened its second consultation meeting specifically to discuss the issue of promoting bond sales. Recently, it will invite representatives from the industrial and commercial sectors, wealthy households, and other sectors who are enthusiastic about national construction to participate in the upcoming third consultation meeting to jointly discuss this issue. The Northeast Daily published an editorial on the 20th, calling on the people of Northeast China to promote the spirit of new patriotism and complete and exceed the construction bond task. Gao Chongmin, chairman of the Northeast General Branch of the China Democratic League, also made a statement, calling on all sectors to promote the spirit of patriotism and actively subscribe.

This newspaper reports: The first year for repayment of principal and interest payment of the Northeast 1949 Production and Construction In-Kind Lottery Bonds has arrived. The first drawing for principal repayment and interest payment lottery was held publicly in Shenyang City on the 20th of this month. Attendees included representatives from various departments of the Northeast People's Government, representatives from all sectors of Shenyang City, and guests, totaling more than 500 people. Attendees pointed out that the production and construction in-kind lottery bonds have received enthusiastic support from the people of Northeast China and maintain a high degree of credibility among the people. The conference then elected eight representatives from all sectors to form the first drawing for principal repayment and interest payment lottery inspection committee. After the committee conducted a detailed inspection of the Northeast Bank's lottery drawing work, the official drawing began. All 27,780 numbers for the first repayment of principal and interest were drawn in one hour. The inspection committee then supervised and directed the lottery drawing, and 153 numbers for the first to seventh prizes were drawn that day. All 10,859 numbers for the eighth, ninth, and tenth prizes were drawn on the 21st.

    东北发行生产建设公债
    上年生产建设实物有奖公债举行首次抽签还本付息摇奖
    【新华社沈阳二十三日电】东北人民政府为迅速恢复与发展东北经济建设，经中央人民政府政务院批准，决定发行一九五○年东北生产建设折实公债三千万分。东北人民政府已于本月十五日发布关于发行建设公债的命令和条例。该公债之募集及还本付息均以实物为计算标准，其单位定名为“分”，总额三千万分，第一期一千七百万分，定于三月一日开始发行；第二期发行时间另定。公债每分系以沈阳市高粱米五市斤，五福布一市尺，粒盐五市斤，原煤三十四市斤之市价总合计算；由东北银行总行于每月一日、十一日、二十一日根据上一旬物价计算公布，作为收付债款的标准。公债分五年作五次偿还，自一九五一年起每年抽签还本一次，第一次抽还总额百分之十，以后每次递增总额的百分之五，至第五次还清。公债利率定为年息五厘，亦以实物为计算标准，每年付息一次。该项公债不准代替货币行使及向国家银行抵押。
    由于东北去年已经发行过一次生产建设公债，在稳定金融物价，增加经济建设力量上，起了相当的作用，一般人民已普遍认识购买公债的好处，所以当东北人民政府于一月二十七日政务会议上通过了上述决定后，即获得东北各地人民的热烈拥护。沈阳市人民协商委员会已召开第二次协商会议，专门讨论了推销公债问题，最近并将邀请热心国家建设的工商界、殷实富户及其他各界代表参加即将召开的第三次协商会议，共同讨论这一问题。东北日报在二十日发表社论，号召东北人民发扬新爱国主义精神，完成并超过建设公债任务。民主同盟东北总支部主任委员高崇民也发表谈话，号召各界发扬爱国精神，踊跃认购。
    【本报讯】东北一九四九年生产建设实物有奖公债第一年还本付息期届，特于本月二十日在沈阳市公开举行第一次抽签还本付息摇奖大会。到会者有东北人民政府各部代表、沈阳市各界代表及来宾等五百余人。与会者指出生产建设实物有奖公债受到东北人民的热烈拥护，并在人民中保有高度信誉。大会随即选出各界代表八人，组成第一次抽签还本付息摇奖检查委员会。该委员会对东北银行抽签摇奖工作详细进行检查后，正式抽签开始，全部第一次还本付息的二万七千七百八十个号码经一小时抽完。检查委员会继即监督指挥摇奖，当日摇出头奖至七奖共一百五十三个号码，第八、九、十奖共一万零八百五十九个号码二十一日全部摇完。
