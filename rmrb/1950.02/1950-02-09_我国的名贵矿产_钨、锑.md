　　China's Valuable Minerals – Tungsten and Antimony
　　Wu Dajun
　　Tungsten and antimony minerals are both particularly abundant in our country. Tungsten is heat and acid resistant, its main use being in the manufacture of tungsten steel and light bulb filaments. Tungsten steel is extremely hard and can be used to make gun barrels, armor plates, high-speed machinery, etc. Therefore, tungsten is an indispensable metal both in war and in peacetime. Antimony expands when cold and contracts when heated, so it is often used in alloys for type metal and stereotype plates. According to pre-war statistics, China ranked first in the world in terms of both reserves and annual output of tungsten and antimony. The national tungsten ore reserves are approximately 3.5 million metric tons, with an average annual output of about 7,000 to 8,000 tons before the war. In 1918 and 1935, when production was at its highest, it reached over 10,000 metric tons per year, accounting for 60% of the world's total output. Antimony ore reserves are approximately 5.41 million metric tons, with the highest annual output of ore reaching over 42,000 metric tons, also accounting for over 50% of the world's total output.

　　China's tungsten ore is mainly distributed in the five provinces of Jiangxi, Hunan, Guangdong, Guangxi, and Yunnan, and has also been found in Xinjiang, the Northeast, and other places. The area around southern Jiangxi is the richest, stretching from Taihe in the north to the border of Guangdong Province in the south, from Huichang in the east to the border of Hunan Province in the west, spanning two hundred miles with over a hundred mines of various sizes. The reserves of Xihuashan in Dayu, Panggushan in Anyuan, Kuimeishan in Longnan, Dajishan in Qiannan, and Huameiao in Xingguo County alone are estimated to be over one million metric tons. The extent of the mining area and the abundance of reserves are truly unparalleled in the world. Jiangxi's annual tungsten production accounts for 70% of the country's total. Guangdong and Guangxi are next, each with reserves of approximately 100,000 metric tons. In 1915, China's tungsten ore was first discovered in Yaogangshan at the intersection of Yizhang, Chenxian, and Zixing counties in Hunan. This was followed by the discovery of Shanmudong in Lechang County, Guangdong. Jiangxi's tungsten ore was discovered in 1918 by a German missionary named Wu Lixiang, who secretly bought up mining areas and recruited people to mine them. After several negotiations, the mining areas were finally recovered. In addition to being distributed in the five provinces of Jiangxi, Guangdong, Guangxi, Yunnan, and Hunan, antimony ore has also been found in Sichuan, Anhui, and Zhejiang, with the Xikuangshan antimony mine in Xinhua and the Banxi antimony mine in Yiyang, Hunan Province, having the largest reserves and scale of production. According to a 1934 estimate, Xikuangshan has reserves of approximately 2.7 million metric tons, accounting for half of the country's total antimony ore reserves. The Banxi antimony mine has reserves of approximately 250,000 metric tons. Hunan Province's highest annual output of refined antimony, crude antimony, and antimony oxide has reached over 26,000 metric tons, with its annual output consistently accounting for over 90% of the country's total. China's antimony ore was first discovered in Banxi. In 1908, a company was formally established and acquired the full rights to the French Helen Schmid distillation antimony refining method at a high price, with exclusive rights to mine. It is said that Xikuangshan has been mined for hundreds of years. Due to its pure quality, it was mistakenly identified as tin at the time, hence the name Xikuangshan (Tin Mine Mountain).

　　In the past, China lacked large-scale equipment for refining tungsten steel or pure antimony. Furthermore, since most of the tungsten and antimony mining rights were owned by landlords, warlords, compradores, and bureaucratic capitalists, almost all tungsten sand and antimony products were shipped abroad, and the benefits were entirely controlled by imperialism. During the First World War, the demand from various warring countries surged, and the prices of tungsten and antimony soared, leading to a significant increase in production. After the war, the demand for tungsten and antimony decreased, sales of various mines stagnated, and many closed down or suspended operations. After 1926, the situation gradually improved. In 1935, the Kuomintang reactionary government established the Jiangxi Tungsten Mining Bureau to unify transportation and sales, monopolizing the transportation, sales, and acquisition of all mineral products. After the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, it was renamed Jiangxi Tungsten and Tin Mining Industry Co., Ltd. In order to intensify the plunder and carry out the civil war, the puppet Executive Yuan further sold out the country's tungsten mining interests, stipulating its so-called foreign debt repayment transportation contract. In 1947, it designated Guizhou, Yunnan, Hunan, Guizhou, and Jiangxi as domestic tungsten and antimony acquisition areas, devalued the purchase price, and shipped all of it to the United States. It stipulated that all transportation of tungsten and antimony ore or its finished products must be issued a transportation permit by the puppet Resources Committee, otherwise it would be confiscated. Under this high degree of monopoly and plunder by the Kuomintang bandit gang, most private manufacturers suffered losses, production plummeted, and various mines successively stopped production. The lives of the workers in the mining areas, which were already difficult, suddenly lost their basis for survival and were forced to become displaced and flee to other places. By the eve of liberation, the number of tungsten miners in Jiangxi had decreased from the original 23,000 to less than 5,000, and the original 3,000 technical workers had been reduced to only 200.

　　After liberation, the state-owned Jiangxi Tungsten and Tin Mining Industry Company held its first production meeting in October, deciding to support private tungsten mines and restore the production of state-owned tungsten mines with emphasis. By the end of November, 1,100 private mine shafts and state-owned mines had resumed work, and production had recovered to one-third of the highest pre-war production. By the end of last year, Jiangxi tungsten mines had completed 98.1% of the total task of the production meeting, and the lives of the miners had also improved. Because the mining company directly purchased ore from private mine shafts and miners, the intermediate exploitation by merchants that the miners had suffered over the years had been eliminated. The problems currently urgently needing to be solved in the mining area are to improve the washing and beneficiation equipment of the mineral silica to increase production and quality. Hunan's antimony mines suffered less damage, but due to the severe contraction caused by the Kuomintang reactionary rule in the past, as of the end of last year, in addition to the smaller mines that had mostly resumed mining using indigenous methods, the larger-scale mines had mostly failed to resume work.

　　我国的名贵矿产——钨、锑
    吴大钧
    钨与锑矿同为我国特别丰富的矿产。钨可抗热抗酸，主要用途为制钨钢及电灯泡之灯丝，钨钢硬度极强，可制炮身、装甲板、高速度之机器等，故钨不论在战时或平时均为不可缺少之金属。锑性冷胀热缩，故多用于活字金、铅版金等的合金上。据战前统计，世界钨、锑的储量和年产量，我国均占第一。全国钨矿的蕴藏量约在三百五十万公吨左右，战前平均年产约七、八千吨。在一九一八年及一九三五年产量最高时，年达万公吨以上，占世界总产量的百分之六十。锑矿蕴藏量约有五百四十一万余公吨，矿砂最多年产达四万二千余公吨，亦占世界总产额的百分之五十以上。
    我国钨矿主要分布于赣、湘、粤、桂、滇五省，新疆、东北等地亦有发现，而以赣南一带为最丰富，北起泰和，南至粤省边境，东达会昌，西迄湖南省界，纵横二百里有大小矿山百余处，其中单以大廋的西华山、安远的盘古山、龙南的岿美山、虔南的大吉山及兴国县的画眉坳等五处而言，储量即约在一百万公吨以上，矿区之广，储量之丰，实为世界所仅有。江西年产钨占全国的百分之七十。其次为粤、桂，约各储藏有十余万公吨。我国钨矿在一九一五年最先发现于湖南宜章、郴县、资兴三县交界之瑶冈山，继之发现于广东乐昌县的杉木洞。江西钨矿于一九一八年为一德籍传教士邬里享所发现，该教士乃暗中收买矿区招人开采，后几经交涉始告收回。锑矿除分布于赣、粤、桂、滇、湘五省外，川、皖、浙各省亦略有发现，其中以湖南省新化锡矿山和益阳板溪二锑矿储量最丰，生产规模亦大，锡矿山储量据一九三四年的估计约二百七十余万公吨，占全国锑矿总储量的一半。板溪锑矿储量约二十五万余公吨。湖南一省最多年产纯锑、生锑、锑养达二万六千余公吨，每年产量恒占全国总产量百分之九十以上。我国锑矿最初发现于板溪，一九○八年正式成立公司以重价购得法人海伦许米德氏蒸馏炼锑法之全权，专利开采。锡矿山据传数百年前即有开采，因品质纯洁，当时误以为锡，锡矿山亦因此得名。
    过去我国因缺乏炼钨钢或纯锑之大规模设备，又因绝大部分的钨、锑矿权属地主、军阀、买办、官僚资本所有，钨砂锑产几全部运销国外，利权实完全操在帝国主义手里。在第一次世界大战期间，因各交战国需要激增，钨、锑价格随之暴涨，产量亦因之大增，战事结束后，钨、锑需要减少，各矿销路停滞，倒闭停工者甚多，至一九二六年后，始渐见起色。一九三五年时，国民党反动政府曾在江西设立钨矿局统一运销，以垄断全部矿产的运销和收购。抗战胜利后，又改名为江西钨锡矿业有限公司。伪行政院为加紧搜括，进行内战，竟进一步出卖国家钨矿权益，订立其所谓对外偿债运货契约，于一九四七年指定了桂、滇、湘、黔、赣为国内钨、锑收购区，贬值收购，全部运往美国，规定凡运输钨、锑矿砂或其制成品，均需经伪资源委员会签发运输证，否则一律没收。在国民党匪帮这种高度的垄断搜刮下，私营厂商多数亏损，产量一落千丈，各矿相继停工，矿区工人生活原来就很苦，至此顿失生存依据，被迫流离失所，逃生外地。到解放前夕，江西钨矿从原有矿工二万三千人减至不足五千人，原有技术工人三千人仅剩二百人。
    解放后，国营江西钨锡矿业公司在十月间曾召开首届生产会议，决定扶助私营钨矿，并有重点地恢复公营钨矿生产。至十一月底已有一千一百个私营矿穴及公营矿场复工，产量亦已恢复到战前最高产量的三分之一。至去年年底，江西钨矿已完成生产会议总任务之百分之九八·一，矿工生活也有了改善。由于矿业公司直接向私营矿穴矿工收购矿砂，矿工们历年来所受商贩中间剥削已免除。目前矿区亟待解决的问题是健全矿矽的洗、选设备，以提高产量和质量。湖南锑矿损失较少，但因过去在国民党反动统治下造成的严重萎缩现象，迄去年年底为止，除较小的矿厂大部恢复用土法开采外，规模较大之矿厂则还大都未能复工。
