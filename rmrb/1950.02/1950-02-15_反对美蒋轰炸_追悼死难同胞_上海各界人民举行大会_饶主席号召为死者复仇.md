　　Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, February 14th: Shanghai people from all walks of life held a meeting at 6 pm on the 12th to oppose the bombing atrocities of the US imperialists and Chiang Kai-shek bandits and to mourn the dead compatriots. Attendees included representatives from various people's organizations, democratic parties, cultural and educational circles, suburban farmers, families of victims, and representatives from the Party, government, and military, totaling 2,000 people. The meeting was opened by Pan Hannian, Deputy Mayor of Shanghai, who delivered the opening speech. After reporting on the damage caused by the bandit planes bombing Shanghai on February 6th and the significance of the memorial meeting, he said, "We believe that the brave people of Shanghai will surely be able to organize strongly, prepare to deal with the bombing atrocities of the US and Chiang Kai-shek, resolutely implement the six major tasks, especially to step up support for the front line, and strive for the final elimination of the remaining bandits and the construction of a new Shanghai!" After Deputy Mayor Pan's speech, the whole audience stood up and observed a three-minute silence. Amidst the mournful music, representatives from various Party, government, and military organs and organizations presented wreaths to the memorial tablets of the dead martyrs. Then, Rao Shushi, Chairman of the East China Military and Political Committee, delivered a speech. He first expressed his condolences to the compatriots who were killed in the disaster, and then pointed out that the US imperialism's massive aid to the Kuomintang bandit gang in the past, and its indiscriminate bombing of the liberated areas, could not save it from failure. Now, this shameless and barbaric atrocity can only arouse the people of Shanghai, the people of China, and the people of the world to become more angry and unite more closely to accelerate the demise of the reactionaries. Finally, Chairman Rao called on everyone to overcome difficulties, completely eliminate the enemy, avenge the dead compatriots, and strive to build a new Shanghai and a new China. Next, Chen Yi, Mayor of Shanghai, delivered a speech. He pointed out that it is the nature of the US imperialists and Chiang Kai-shek bandits to wreak havoc and hatred on the people who have gained liberation and freedom. Therefore, the US-Chiang bombing will continue. We should step up our anti-bombing work. He put forward the working guidelines of air defense, fire prevention, first aid, evacuation of the population, and post-disaster work, and instructed that the city's working methods, production methods, and organizational forms should be appropriately changed to meet the requirements of air defense and evacuation. After Mayor Chen's speech, representatives of the families of the deceased spoke. In their speeches, they all believed that the bombing on February 6th was the last act of desperation of the US imperialists and the remaining bandits before their death. They expressed their determination to stand with all the citizens of Shanghai, resolutely work hard to overcome any difficulties, support the People's Liberation Army, liberate all of China, and avenge the dead! Subsequently, representatives from the Shanghai Federation of Trade Unions, the business community, the Democratic Women's Federation, and the Democratic Youth Federation delivered speeches. The representatives unanimously expressed their condolences to the dead compatriots and their sympathy to the families of the martyrs and the injured. They called on the people of Shanghai to unite more closely, organize, step up air defense and evacuation, and strive to purchase victory bonds to support the front line and liberate Taiwan Island, the last stronghold of the remaining bandits! Finally, the meeting passed a telegram to Chairman Mao, Premier Zhou, and compatriots across the country and people around the world, accusing the atrocities of the US imperialists and the remaining bandits.
