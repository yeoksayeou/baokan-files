　　East China's State-Owned Enterprise Workers
    Voluntarily Donate Annual Bonuses to the State
  　Annual Bonus Issues for Private Enterprise Workers Basically Resolved Through Consultations Between Labor and Management in Various Industries.
    [Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 12th] The issue of year-end double pay and bonuses for workers in state-owned enterprises in East China has been handled in accordance with the regulations of the Financial and Economic Committee of the Central People's Government, and distribution began successively at the end of last year. The issue of annual bonuses for workers in private enterprises has also been basically resolved through consultations between labor and management in various industries. After the announcement of the Central Financial and Economic Committee's regulations on the handling of year-end salaries and bonuses, it was enthusiastically supported by workers in various regions and industries after extensive publicity by the trade unions and the organization of widespread study and discussion among the workers. Many workers have consciously and voluntarily donated their year-end double pay and bonuses one after another. Workers with difficult family lives have also received less annual bonuses based on their specific circumstances. In addition to the situation in Shanghai and Nanjing state-owned enterprises reported in this agency's telegram on the 2nd of this month (published on the second page of this newspaper on the 3rd of this month), among the 969 employees of the Jinan Telecommunications Bureau in Shandong, 103 voluntarily donated all their annual bonuses to the state, 67 donated all of it to aid disaster victims, 242 used all of it to purchase public bonds, and the remaining workers with difficult lives received either half or three-quarters of the full amount. The annual bonuses of workers in thirteen factories, power plants, shipyards, and other places under the Qingdao China Textile Construction Company began to be distributed at the end of last year and have now been largely distributed. Many workers have also requested not to receive them or to use their bonuses to purchase public bonds. Workers in more than thirty enterprises in southern Anhui, Zhejiang, and northern Jiangsu have all donated their entire annual bonuses to the state as construction funds. All employees of the China Merchants Bureau in Zhenjiang, Anqing, and other places have also donated their entire annual bonuses to the state as shipbuilding funds. Workers in northern Anhui have donated their annual bonuses to aid disaster victims.
    In the process of handling year-end double pay and bonuses, some biases have occurred in individual enterprises. The most important thing is that some trade union cadres did not understand the spirit of the Financial and Economic Committee's decision. In addition, their work style was rough, and they did not patiently explain it to the workers in detail, nor did they allow workers to conduct democratic discussions to truly achieve consciousness and voluntariness. Instead, they used methods such as holding general meetings or signature competitions to encourage the collective donation of the masses of workers, which caused dissatisfaction among some workers. Secondly, some trade union cadres and administrative cadres did not calmly consider and take care of the living difficulties of some workers, so that some workers were motivated by temporary enthusiasm and excessively donated their annual bonuses, causing difficulties in their lives. These biases have been promptly overcome after being pointed out or discovered.
    Regarding the issue of annual bonuses for workers in private enterprises, localities are generally able to resolve it through consultations between labor and management based on the principle of "benefit for both labor and capital, development of production," with reference to past practices in each industry and the current specific circumstances of production and business operations. If the capitalists have actual difficulties, the workers can generally understand. For example, the capitalists of Shenxin No. 7 Factory in Shanghai are currently short of funds, so the workers have automatically proposed to postpone the issuance of annual bonuses. Some capitalists in some enterprises have an incorrect attitude, excessively emphasizing the difficulties of production and using various methods to demand concessions from workers, but after trade unions persuaded them and repeated consultations between labor and management, they have also been appropriately resolved.

　　华东各公营企业职工
    自愿将年奖捐献国家
  　私营企业职工年奖问题，经各业劳资双方协商，亦基本上获得解决。
    【新华社上海十二日电】华东区各公营企业职工年终双薪、奖金问题，均已按照中央人民政府政务院财政经济委员会规定办法处理，并自去年年底陆续开始发放。私营企业职工年奖问题，经各业劳资双方协商结果，亦已基本上获得解决。中央财经委员会规定的年终薪奖处理办法公布后，经过工会的大力宣传和在职工们中间组织广泛的学习讨论，得到了各地各业职工的热烈拥护。许多工人自觉自愿地相继捐献年终双薪、奖金。家庭生活有困难的职工，也都根据自己的具体情况，少领年奖。除上海、南京公营企业情况见本社本月二日电讯外（刊本报本月三日第二版），山东济南电信局九百六十九名职工中，有一百零三人自愿将全部年奖捐献国家，六十七人以全数捐献救济灾胞，二百四十二人以全数购买公债，其余生活有困难的职工，或领一半，或领全数的四分之三不等。青岛中国纺织建设公司十三个厂和电厂、造船厂等处职工年奖，从去年年底开始发放，现已大体发放完毕，其中也有许多职工要求不领，或以奖金购买公债。皖南、浙江、苏北等地有三十几个企业单位的职工，均将全部年奖献给国家，作为建设费用。镇江、安庆等地招商局全体职工也将年奖全数献给国家，作为造船经费。皖北职工则纷纷将年奖献出救济灾胞。
    在处理年终双薪和奖金的过程中，个别企业单位曾经发生过一些偏向。最主要的是有些工会干部不了解财委会决定的精神，加以工作作风粗糙，没有经过耐心向职工详加说明，没有使职工进行民主讨论，真正做到自觉自愿，而是用开全体大会或签名竞赛等方式，来鼓动工人群众集体捐献，致使部分工人不满。其次是有些工会干部和行政干部，没有冷静地考虑和照顾部分职工的生活困难，以致有些职工激于一时热情，过度地捐献年奖，生活发生困难。这些偏向经指出或发觉后，均已及时克服。
    关于私营企业职工年奖问题，各地大体都能依据“劳资两利，发展生产”的原则，参照各该业往年旧例和目前生产、营业的具体情况，由劳资双方协商解决。如资方现有实际困难，工人们一般都能体谅。如上海申新七厂资方目前资金缺乏，工人们就自动提出缓发年奖。也有一些企业的资方抱着不正确的态度，过分强调生产的困难，用种种方法要求工人让步，但经工会说服和劳资双方反复协商，也都已获得适当解决。
