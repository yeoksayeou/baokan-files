　　Hebei Provincial People's Government Directs Subordinates
    Complete Seed Loans Before the Spring Festival
    To Ensure Timely Sowing of Spring Wheat
    [Baoding Dispatch] In order to ensure that disaster areas can sow spring wheat in a timely manner and shorten the spring famine, the Hebei Provincial Government recently issued an urgent directive to concentrate efforts on completing the loaning of wheat seeds before the Spring Festival. The directive first requires: special offices, county governments, and economic departments such as banks and supply and marketing cooperatives in areas where spring wheat is sown should extract as many cadres as possible and immediately organize seed loan work groups to be specifically responsible for seed loan work. The directive stipulates that February 5th to 15th is a concentrated ten-day period for seed loaning; on the one hand, they are responsible for purchasing and transferring seeds, and on the other hand, they conduct investigations and loan seeds. The directive points out: it is necessary to mobilize and educate the masses to help each other borrow seeds to solve seed difficulties and overcome the idea of simply relying on the government. It is necessary to publicize the freedom to borrow and lend wheat seeds, and interest rates should be voluntarily determined by both parties. All mixed and impure (spring and autumn wheat mixed) or moldy wheat seeds are strictly prohibited from being loaned out. Oppose the purely task-oriented viewpoint and sloppy style of work of loaning seeds for the sake of loaning seeds. The directive requires all departments to fully recognize that sowing spring wheat is one of the important keys to shortening the spring famine. Promote a high degree of responsibility to the people and strive to loan spring wheat seeds to households in flood-affected areas before February 15th. Leaders at all levels should also conduct inspections at any time.
