Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, February 17th: Warsaw, Polish News Agency dispatch of February 16th - All Polish newspapers featured the news of the signing of the Sino-Soviet agreement on their front pages, and published the full text of the agreement and editorials.

    The People's Forum wrote in a lengthy editorial: In the peaceful capital of Moscow, historically significant steps have been taken to strengthen and consolidate peace. In Moscow, the capital of democracy and socialism, the forces of democracy and socialism have been further and greatly strengthened. In Moscow, the capital of the new world, agreements have been concluded that constitute a new type of international relations between truly free countries.

    The agreements concluded between the Soviet Union and China are the culmination of the entire historical period of relations between the two countries since the Great October Revolution. At this historically significant moment, the Sino-Soviet agreement is particularly eloquent. At a time when the United States is intensifying the Marshall Plan and colonizing other countries, the Soviet Union is precisely at this moment abandoning the bases it acquired in China during the war against Japan, according to agreements concluded with the former Kuomintang government.

    The Sino-Soviet agreement is a great contribution to the task of strengthening peace. These agreements are concluded on the basis of respecting the principles of the United Nations, and their purpose is to prevent the resurgence of imperialist aggression, thereby incorporating the Chinese people into a system of alliance that today safeguards the security of one-third of humanity and constitutes a powerful dam to deter the warmongers' insane plans to launch a new world massacre.

    The historical significance of the Sino-Soviet agreement extends far beyond the Asian continent. These agreements will enrage all kinds of war peddlers, because these agreements have once again shattered the plots of their sinister, insane, and adventurous policies, and are another blow to imperialism.

    The working people of the whole world will welcome these agreements with joy, hailing them as another powerful fortress of lasting, universal, and democratic peace created by hundreds of millions of people.

Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, February 18th: Warsaw, Polish News Agency dispatch of February 16th - The newspaper "Armed Poland" recently published an editorial entitled "An Alliance of Seven Hundred Million People," stating: The system of alliances between the Soviet Union and the people's democracies, with the aim of defending peace and opposing any aggression, is being supplemented by similar alliances in the East, in Asia. The countries that are advancing along the path of progress and justice are linked together by concluding unbreakable alliances with the Soviet Union, which defeated German and Japanese fascism. This constitutes a completely unified and powerful camp that no reactionary force can destroy. Hundreds of millions of working people around the world see in the agreements signed in Moscow a further strengthening of the peace camp, a new blow to the warmongers, and a new victory for all the people who are guided by the great ideal of peace in their daily work and struggle.

    A Warsaw newspaper editorial stated: The signing of several Sino-Soviet agreements is a new failure for American imperialism. During the Moscow negotiations, American newspapers were talking every day about "heavy difficulties." US Secretary of State Acheson even tried to fabricate some imaginary "difficulties" himself when he made remarks about the so-called Soviet plans for Manchuria, and so on. Lippmann and other American commentators have discussed the "Titoism" of the People's China. But today, Acheson, Lippmann, and the like must bear the consequences of all this foolishness. The newspaper pointed out that the signing of the Sino-Soviet agreement will have great significance for the entire Asian continent and will further weaken the American position in the Far East. The people of Vietnam, Indonesia, or Malaya will once again be deeply convinced of who is the true friend of the Asian people who are fighting for peace and independence.

Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, February 17th: Telegraph Agency dispatch of February 16th: The Romanian Workers' Party organ, Spark, commented on the Sino-Soviet treaty, stating: "The alliance of the world's largest power and the world's most populous country is a historic contribution to the cause of peace and freedom."

The Bulgarian newspaper "Labor" commented on the Sino-Soviet treaty, stating: "Hundreds of millions of peace advocates around the world will welcome with great joy the extraordinary manifestation of the great friendship between the Soviet people and hundreds of millions of Chinese people." The newspaper described the treaty as "a strong and invincible fortress of world peace." It marks "a historic moment in the lives of two great nations and all progressive humanity."

　　七亿人民结成强大同盟  严重打击了战争挑拨者
    波、罗、保各报齐为中苏新条约而欢呼
    【新华社北京十七日电】波兰通讯社华沙十六日讯：波兰所有一切报纸均以首页刊载中苏协定签订的消息，并发表协定的全文及社论。
    人民论坛报在长篇社论中写道：在和平的首都莫斯科，已在加强与巩固和平的方向上采取了有历史意义的步骤，在民主与社会主义的首都莫斯科，民主与社会主义的力量已获得了进一步的、巨大的加强。在新世界的首都莫斯科，已经缔结了构成各个真正自由国家之间的新型国际关系的各项协定。
    苏联与中国所缔结的各项协定，是伟大十月革命后开始的两国关系历史之整个时期中的成就的最高峰。际此有历史意义的时刻，中苏协定具有特别的雄辩性。美国正在加紧马歇尔化和殖民地化其他国家，而苏联恰恰就在这个时候放弃其在对日战争期间根据与前国民党政府所缔结的协定而在中国所取得的根据地。
    中苏协定对于加强和平的任务，是一个莫大的贡献。这些协定是在尊重联合国组织各项原则的基础上缔结的，其目的在于防止帝国主义侵略的死灰复燃，从而把中国人民容纳到同盟的制度中，而这种同盟在今天保障着三分之一人类的安全，并且构成了阻遏战争挑拨者发动新的世界大屠杀的疯狂计划的强大堤闸。
    中苏协定的历史意义，远不以亚洲大陆为限。这些协定将使形形色色的战争贩子暴跳如雷，因为这些协定又一次粉碎了他们罪恶、疯狂与冒险的政策之图谋，是加诸帝国主义头上的又一次打击。
    全世界劳动人民将怀着喜悦的心情欢迎这些协定，誉之为亿万人民所缔造的、持久、普遍与民主的和平的又一个强大的堡垒。
    【新华社北京十八日电】波兰通讯社华沙十六日讯：《武装的波兰》报顷以《七亿人民的同盟》为题发表社论称：苏联与各人民民主国家以保卫和平反对任何侵略为目的的同盟的体系，正被在东方、在亚洲同类的同盟所补充。正在沿着进步与公正之道路前进的各个国家，由于与战胜德日法西斯的苏联缔结了坚不可破的同盟而连结在一起，这就构成了完全一致的强大的阵营，没有任何反动力量能破坏它。全世界亿万劳动人民从莫斯科签订的各项协定中看到了和平阵营的进一步加强，看到了对战争挑拨者的一个新打击，看到了所有一切在日常工作与斗争中为和平这一伟大理想所指导的人民所获得的新胜利。
    华沙报的社论称：几个中苏协定的签订，是美国帝国主义的新失败。在莫斯科谈判期间，美国报纸曾天天在谈述什么“困难重重”。美国国务卿艾奇逊甚至在发表关于所谓苏联对满洲之计划等等的言论时，还企图亲自杜撰一些幻想的“困难”出来。李普曼及其他美国评论员，曾论述什么人民中国的“铁托主义”。但在今天，艾奇逊、李普曼之流必须自食这一切愚蠢之果。该报指出：中苏协定的签订对于整个亚洲大陆将有巨大的意义，且将使美国在远东的阵地更加削弱。越南、印尼或马来亚的人民，将又一次深信：谁是为和平与独立而斗争的亚洲人民的真正友人。
    【新华社北京十七日电】电通社十六日消息：罗马尼亚工人党机关报火花报评论中苏条约称：“世界上最大的强国与世界上人口最多的国家之联盟，是对于和平与自由事业的历史性的贡献。”
    保加利亚《劳动报》评论中苏条约称：“全世界的亿万和平拥护者，将以巨大的喜悦来欢迎苏联人民和亿万中国人民间之伟大友谊的非凡表现。”该报描叙条约为“世界和平的强大而不可征服的堡垒”。它标帜着“两大民族和全体进步人类之生活的历史性时刻”。
