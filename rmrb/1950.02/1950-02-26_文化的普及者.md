　　Disseminators of Culture
    The American officers in West Germany are doing their best to transmit the culture from across the ocean to the people of West Germany. They not only supply the three occupied zones with chewing gum, Hollywood movies, and pulp fiction, but also attempt to infect the German people with their personal examples, converting them to this so-called American way of life.
    The "Berlin Daily" published some examples of outstanding actions by American soldiers:
    For nearly three weeks in December, a team of four American soldiers carried out twenty-eight attacks on German citizens.
    On New Year's Day, an American soldier stole four pieces of pajamas from a hotel.
    American soldiers stabbed a German waiter in the arm and face. Another German was injured in the head.
    The Associated Press clarified another aspect of the American benefactors' actions in West Germany. It said: There are nearly thirteen thousand illegitimate children in the American occupied zone whose "fathers" are Americans.
    From one of the recent reports of the Nuremberg police, one can also find vivid examples of the "American way of life" in the three occupied zones:
    "In a cellar near Erlangen, near Nuremberg, some Americans entertained themselves by shooting at live targets. They shot at German pedestrians, whose only means of rescue was to prostrate themselves on the ground."
    ADN news agency reported from Nuremberg:
    American soldiers frequently attack passengers and service personnel on urban transportation lines. Their hooliganism on streetcars has gradually expanded to the point where police protection of the streetcars has become necessary.
    The police chief of Regensburg, in response to protests from peaceful residents about the misbehavior and attacks of American soldiers, wisely advised German women "not to go out after dark." But even this advice was useless.
    They broke down doors – "Berlin Daily" said – Usually, all their misdeeds go unpunished. "The culprit disappears before the crime is confirmed" is now a common idiom in West German newspapers.
    This is the "culture" of the knights of the "American way of life."

　　文化的普及者
    西德的美国长官们尽力把隔岸的文化传给西德人民。他们不仅以口香糖、好莱坞影片和暗杀小说供给三个占领区，而且企图以个人的例子感染德国人民皈依这样所谓的美国生活方式。
    “柏林日报”刊载了一些美兵出色行动的例子：
    十二月的近三个星期，由四个美国兵所组成的队伍对德国公民曾作了二十八次攻击。
    在新年那天，一个美国兵从一个旅馆里偷走了四件睡衣。
    美国兵们刺伤了一个德国侍者的臂和面部。另一个德国人头部受伤。
    联合社阐明了西德的美国施恩主行动的另一面。它说：在美国占领区有近一万三千个其“父亲”为美国人的私生子。
    从努连堡警察的最近报告之一，同样可以找到在三占领区“美国生活方式”的鲜明例子：
    “在努连堡附近的爱尔兰根一个地穴中，有些美国人以射击活目标来娱乐自己。他们射击德国行人，行人唯一营救方法是必须俯伏在地上。”
    ＡＤＮ通讯社从努连堡报道：
    美国兵在城市交通线上经常地攻击乘客和服务人员。在电车上他们的流氓行为逐渐扩大，以至保护电车的警察已成为必需的了。
    累根斯堡的警察局长在回答和平居民的抗议美兵胡作非为和攻击行为时曾贤明地劝告德国妇女“天黑后不要出门”。但是，连这个劝告亦是无用。
    他们打破了门——“柏林日报”说——平常，所有他们的胡作非为是不受惩罚的。“没有证实以前罪人就不见了”这句话，现在在西德报纸中是一个常备的成语了。
    这就是“美国生活方式”的骑士的“文化”。
