Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, February 11th: Warsaw dispatch from the Polish News Agency: Samborski, Secretary of the Central Committee of the Polish United Workers' Party, reported on January 31st at a meeting of the secretaries of the provincial and district committees of the Polish United Workers' Party on the tasks of the Workers' Party organization in developing production cooperatives. Samborski stated: Production cooperatives are the only road for the countryside to go socialist. For the working peasants, this is the only road to get rid of the exploitation of rural landlords, improve farming methods, move towards prosperity, and eliminate the backwardness of the material and spiritual culture of the countryside. For the working class, production cooperatives are the basis for ensuring a continuous increase in food and raw materials and the industrialization of the country, and also the basis for a large increase in the working class and the rural population. As of January 28th, a total of 348 production cooperatives have been registered, of which 16 are youth cooperatives. In the past three months, 175 new cooperatives have been established. Peasants are increasingly interested in cooperatives. A considerable number of production cooperatives have achieved remarkable economic results, which has a great impact on the medium and small farmers in their vicinity.
    Samborski talked about the steps to make all cooperatives model cooperatives. He analyzed credit loans and economics, described the tasks of party organizations in cooperatives, and proposed to further expand the role of rural women in cooperatives. Samborski concluded: The situation in the countryside has undergone fundamental changes. The task of constantly strengthening existing cooperatives economically has become even more urgent.

　　乡村走向社会主义的唯一道路
    波兰发展生产合作社 
    统一工人党中委会书记萨姆布劳斯基报告
    【新华社北京十一日电】波兰通讯社华沙讯：波兰统一工人党中央委员会书记萨姆布劳斯基于一月三十一日在波统一工人党省委会与区委会书记会议上，报告工人党组织对发展生产合作社的任务，萨姆布劳斯基称：生产合作社是使乡村走向社会主义的唯一道路。对劳动农民来说，这是摆脱农村财主的剥削、改进耕作方法、走向繁荣、消灭乡村物质文化和精神文化的落后性的唯一道路。对工人阶级来说，生产合作社是保证食物与原料不断增加和国家工业化的基础，也是工人阶级和农村人民人口大量增加的基础。截至一月二十八日止，已注册的生产合作社共三百四十八个，其中有十六个是青年合作社。在最近三个月内成立的新合作社，计一百七十五个。农民对合作社已越来越感兴趣。相当多的生产合作社已获得了卓越的经济成果，这对其邻近的中、小农有很大影响。
    萨姆布劳斯基谈到使所有合作社成为模范合作社的步骤。分析了信用贷款经济，叙述了合作社里党组织的任务，并提出更加扩大农村妇女对合作社的作用。萨姆布劳斯基结语称：农村的情况已有了根本的改变。经常在经济上加强现存合作社的任务，已更为迫切了。
