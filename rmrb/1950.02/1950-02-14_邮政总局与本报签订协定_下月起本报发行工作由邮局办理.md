　　The General Post Office Signs Agreement with This Newspaper
    Starting Next Month, Distribution of This Newspaper Will Be Handled by the Post Office
    [This Newspaper] After earnest and responsible discussions between the General Post Office of the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications of the Central People's Government and the People's Daily, an agreement on newspaper distribution was formally signed at 11:00 AM on February 13th in the conference room of the General Post Office. In addition to representatives from the General Post Office and the newspaper, Minister Zhu of the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications and representatives from the News Administration also attended. The agreement stipulates that starting March 1st, the People's Daily will hand over all distribution work of the People's Daily to the Post Office. The newspaper will be responsible for determining the distribution guidelines and policies, while the Post Office will specifically decide and implement technical issues related to distribution. During the signing of the agreement, Deputy Director Zhao Zhigang of the General Post Office delivered a speech, pointing out that the Post Office had undertaken newspaper distribution tasks during the war and achieved good results. Moreover, the First National People's Postal Conference in December last year decided to include newspaper distribution as one of the Post Office's exclusive business operations. The representative of the People's Daily stated in his speech that the postal system is widespread throughout the country, and handing over newspaper distribution to the Post Office is the only correct approach. If the Post Office encounters difficulties after taking over the distribution work, the newspaper will definitely help to solve them, because our goal is to work together to disseminate the newspaper to the broad masses of people. Therefore, the newspaper should adopt a completely supportive and trusting attitude towards the Post Office. Minister Zhu of the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications emphasized in his speech that newspaper distribution is a political task that requires universality, accuracy, and speed, and the Post Office possesses these valuable conditions to spread various policies nationwide and serve the people's cultural endeavors. Minister Zhu then pointed out that after the Post Office accepts this task, in culturally backward and remote areas, it should not only develop distribution work but also take on the organizational work of mass readership. A representative from the News Administration pointed out in his speech that using the Post Office to distribute newspapers was determined at the National Newspaper Management Conference. The signing of the distribution agreement between the General Post Office and the People's Daily is only the beginning, and after gaining experience, it will be promoted throughout the country.
