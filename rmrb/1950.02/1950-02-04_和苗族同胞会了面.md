　　Meeting with Miao Compatriots
　　On November 20th last year, comrades from the South Sichuan Branch of the People's Liberation Army Southwest Service Group heard good news in Zhijiang County, Hunan: "Guiyang has been liberated!" The comrades were overjoyed. The branch headquarters encouraged everyone, saying: Comrades, let's follow closely behind the brother troops who liberated Guiyang!
　　The comrades were both happy and worried to hear that they would be passing through the Miao areas after entering Guizhou, fearing that the Miao compatriots might not yet understand the People's Liberation Army, and that they might encounter difficulties with food and lodging. For two days, the 20th and 21st, everyone was busy preparing: dry rations, rain gear, straw sandals… everything was packed. On the 22nd, they set off in the rain at dawn.
　　As the saying goes: Guizhou is a place where "the sky is not clear for three days, and the ground is not level for three miles"; only after entering Guizhou did they realize that in the rainy season of late autumn and early winter, it was practically "the sky is not clear for a single day, and the ground is not level for a single mile." The comrades were constantly turning around on high mountains in the rain every day. With a "slip," someone would fall head over heels, causing a burst of laughter; but before the laughing person could be careful, he himself would also take a tumble. After falling again and again, everyone became a mud person, but the laughter never stopped. Many roads and bridges were destroyed by the bandit troops, so the comrades held hands to cross the water and helped the cooks prepare meals. Along the way, the people, seeing this team that knew no fatigue or difficulty, some nodded and smiled, and others even gave a thumbs up, saying: "The Liberation Army is really good."
　　From Zhenyuan to Shibing, they were not far from the Miao area, and the comrades' spirits became even more tense. Some comrades said, "If the Miao people don't let us into their houses, we'll have to prepare to camp in the rain." Another comrade said, "If the Miao people are unwilling to trade rice for salt with us, we'll have to prepare to go hungry." Some people were quietly practicing simple Miao phrases.
　　As dusk approached, the team was about to arrive in Shibing City. They happened to meet two women wearing blue cloth dresses and carrying thatch on their backs. At this time, a Guizhou comrade whispered, "These are Miao women!" This sentence spread like wildfire, and soon everyone knew. The team walked even faster, and everyone curiously looked at the Miao women. Another comrade whispered, "Don't look, I'm afraid they won't like it!" Some comrades really lowered their heads and dared not look anymore. However, the Miao women were not afraid. They smiled and also looked at the team. One Miao woman even told the comrades in Chinese: "Are you camping in the city? It's only three miles away." This proves that although this area has only been liberated for less than a few days, they already have a considerable understanding of the Liberation Army. The comrades' tense mood immediately relaxed.
　　Upon entering Shibing City, many Miao women were selling vegetables with shoulder poles; some comrades were even assigned to live in Miao homes, where they were warmly welcomed by the Miao compatriots. Everyone had a wonderful night that night, no one camped outdoors, and everyone had a good dinner.
　　The next day, Miao women were selling snacks everywhere along the way, all of which were homemade foods, such as rice cakes, corn flowers, and roasted sweet potatoes, in many varieties. They said to the Liberation Army soldiers who stopped to rest: "When the Kuomintang reactionary army was here, no one dared to do business. Now that you have come, life should be better in the future!" Some comrades, because this place had just been liberated and were afraid that they could not yet accept Renminbi, used copper coins to buy things. They shook their heads with a smile and said, "We don't care about copper coins, we want the Liberation Army's bills."
　　The Miao women's attire is very beautiful: their hair is combed into a high bun on their foreheads, wrapped in blue cloth. They wear round-necked tops, and around their waists they wear pleated blue cloth skirts, and their legs are wrapped in blue leggings. Although the weather is very cold, they still wear straw sandals barefoot. They are all very healthy, and with such attire, they look very energetic. They not only do business, but also many Miao women are seen working in the fields like men along the way.
　　The Miao men wear the same clothes as the Han people, making it difficult to distinguish them. When a few comrades walked to the outskirts of Huangping City, they saw three or four people running down the mountain with sticks. One comrade whispered to an old man wearing a tattered military uniform next to him, "Are they Miao people?" The man said, "Yes, I am too!" Everyone asked him why he was wearing a military uniform. He said, "Because I had no clothes to wear, I bought this tattered cotton jacket. If you hadn't come, I wouldn't dare to wear it. When the Kuomintang was here, I wore this clothes working in the fields, they said I was a deserter and came to arrest me. I ran for my life and jumped off a cliff, breaking my leg!" As he spoke, he pointed to his still bandaged left leg and shed tears of sorrow and indignation. Then, he told the comrades that the houses of those Miao families carrying wooden sticks had been burned down by the Kuomintang bandit troops, their belongings had been looted, and several young men had been dragged away. He also said that most Miao families had no land, they farmed the landlords' land, and after harvesting the grain, in addition to the four-six split, they also had to bear all the land taxes for the landlords. The comrades explained to him the Communist Party's policy on nationalities and the land policy, and also told him some of the reasons for the poor to turn over, and he happily grabbed the comrades' hands and said, "That's great! The Miao family never expected this day to come!"
　　After the comrades of the South Sichuan Branch of the Southwest Service Group entered the Miao area, not only did they not encounter any difficulties, but they also received a lot of help from the local Miao compatriots. The Miao people exchanged snow-white rice for them to eat, sold them cheap things to use, and also voluntarily helped the engineers and bravely repaired the bridges destroyed by Chiang bandits.
　　The Liberation Army comrades met with the dear Miao compatriots and received the warm reception and active support of the Miao compatriots, which further strengthened their determination to advance rapidly, liberate all of China, and liberate all ethnic compatriots.

### 和苗族同胞会了面

　　和苗族同胞会了面
    去年十一月二十号，人民解放军西南服务团川南支队的同志们，在湖南芷江县城听到一个好消息：“贵阳解放了！”同志们都乐得闭不上嘴。支队部鼓励大家说：同志们，咱们紧随着解放贵阳的兄弟部队前进吧！
    同志们听说进了贵州以后，要过苗族的地区，又高兴又发愁，怕苗族同胞对人民解放军还不怎么了解，吃饭宿营可能会碰到困难。二十号二十一号两天，大伙都忙着准备，干粮、雨具、草鞋……都收拾好了，二十二号天刚亮，他们就冒着雨出发了。
    俗话说：贵州是“天无三日晴，地无三里平”的；等到一进了贵州，才知道在秋冬之交的多雨季节，简直是“天无一日晴，地无一里平”。同志们天天顶着雨在高山上转来转去。“出溜”一下就是一个跟头，引起大家的一阵哗笑；可是笑的人一不留神，他自己也栽了个跟头。摔来摔去，谁都成了泥人，大家的笑声也总是不断。公路和桥梁给匪军破坏的很多，同志们拉着手过水，帮着炊事员做饭。一路上的老百姓，看到这支不知道疲乏和困难的队伍，有人点头微笑，有人更竖起大拇指来说：“解放军真是要得。”
    从镇远到施秉的一段，离苗区不远了，同志们精神更紧张了。有的同志说：“苗胞要是不让进房子，可得准备雨地里露营啦。”又有一位同志说：“苗胞要是不愿意拿米跟我们换食盐，我们还准备得挨饿呢。”有人就在小声练习着简单的苗族话。
    天快黑的时候，队伍就要到施秉城了。正碰上两个穿青布衣裙，背着茅草的妇女。这时候，一位贵州同志小声说：“这就是苗家妇女！”这句话一传十，十传百，一会就传遍了，队伍走得更快了，大伙好奇的瞧着苗女。又一位同志小声说：“不能看，怕她们不愿意！”有的同志真的低下了头，不敢再看了。可是苗女并没害怕，她们笑着，也向队伍瞧，有一个苗女还用汉族话告诉同志们：“你们在城里宿营吧？就剩三里路了。”这证明：虽然这个地区才解放不到几天，他们对解放军已经有了相当认识。同志们紧张的情绪立刻舒坦下来了。
    进了施秉城，有好多苗家妇女挑着担子在卖菜；有的同志还给分配到苗家去住，受到苗族同胞的热烈欢迎。大家那一晚过得很美，没有人露营，而且都饱饱的吃上一顿好晚饭。
    第二天，沿路到处有苗女卖零食，都是些家常的食品，像米粑粑呀、包谷花呀、烤白薯呀，花样很多。她们和停下来休息的解放军战士说：“国民党反动军队在这里的时候，谁也不敢作生意，你们来了，以后的日子该好过啦！”有的同志因为这儿刚解放，怕她们还不能接受人民币，就用铜元买东西，她们倒笑着摇手说：“我们不希罕铜元，我愿意要解放军的票子。”
    苗女的装束是很好看的：头发在额前梳成高高的髻子，拿青色的布包起来，穿的是圆领的上衣，腰间系着青布多摺的裙子，两腿用青绑腿裹起来，天气虽然很冷，她们可还光脚穿草鞋。她们的身体都很健康，加上这样打扮，看去是很精神的。她们不光作生意，一路上还看到很多苗女和男子一样的在田里干活。
    苗族的男子，和汉人穿着同样的衣服，很难分辨出来。有几位同志走到黄平城郊的时候，看见三四个人拿着棍子从山上跑下来，一位同志小声向旁边一个穿破军装的老百姓说：“他们是不是苗家？”那人说：“是的呀，我也是的呀！”大家问他为什么穿军装，他说：“因为没有衣服穿，才买来这件破棉袄，要不是你们来，我还不敢穿呢，国民党在这里的时候，我穿着这件衣服在田里干活，他们说我是逃兵，就来抓我，我拚命的跑，从山崖跳下去把腿都摔断啦！”说着他指指还包扎着的左腿，悲忿的流下眼泪。接着，他告诉同志们：那几个拿木棍的苗家的房子，给国民党匪军烧光了，东西也给抢光了，几个青年男子也给拉跑了。他还说：苗家大半没有田产，种地主们的田，打下的粮食，除了四六分以外，还要替地主负担全部田赋。同志们给他说明了共产党的民族政策和土地政策，还和他讲了一些穷人翻身的道理，他高兴的抓着同志们的手说：“好极啦！苗家想不到有这一天！”
    西南服务团川南支队的同志们进入苗区以后，不但没有遇到什么困难，反而得到当地苗胞的很多的帮助，苗家换给他们雪白的米吃，卖给他们便宜的东西用，还自动帮助工兵，奋勇的抢修蒋匪破坏的桥梁。
    解放军的同志们，会见了亲爱的苗族同胞，受到了苗族同胞的亲热的接待和积极的支援，就更进一步加强了迅速进军，解放全中国解放各族同胞的决心。
