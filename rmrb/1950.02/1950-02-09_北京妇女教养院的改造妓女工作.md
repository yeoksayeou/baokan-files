　　The Reforming Prostitutes Work of Beijing Women's Reformatory
    The Beijing Women's Production and Reformatory has been established for over two months. More than 1,300 sisters who have suffered immense torment and exploitation are gradually healing their mental and physical wounds here. They are now receiving education from the People's Government, and in the near future, this group of reborn women will gloriously join the production front.
    In the first few days after the city's prostitutes were concentrated in the reformatory, some of them felt very excited and happy, but most still harbored concerns. Those who were originally first and second-class prostitutes openly expressed dissatisfaction. Some even deliberately stirred up trouble, attempting to incite everyone to escape.

  Explaining Policies, Stabilizing Life
    Faced with this situation, the initial work of the reformatory, in addition to patiently explaining policies to the trainees, focused on stabilizing their lives. The staff worked day and night to improve the food, arrange bedding, light stoves, and bring children and elderly mothers who had no one to care for them at home to the reformatory. Clothing left in the brothels was retrieved intact, and those with acute illnesses were sent to hospitals for treatment. When the trainees felt that not only had their lives been resolved, but the staff was also so enthusiastically caring and considerate towards them, they were deeply moved, and their emotions gradually stabilized.

    After stabilizing their lives, they began to receive enlightening education. More than 1,300 trainees were divided into squadrons, platoons, and groups in eight sections. The staff lived with the trainees to understand their thoughts. Because they had suffered long-term mental and physical abuse, they were initially unwilling to talk about their painful experiences, believing that it was their destiny. Although they deeply hated the bosses and madams, they were always afraid of having to rely on them in the future, so no one dared to accuse them of their crimes.

  Enlightening and Complaining, Accusing Madams
    Targeting the above thoughts, the first step of the education work was to expose the evils of the old society, especially the brothel owners and madams, and find the root causes of their suffering. During large lectures, stories similar to their lives were told to touch the trainees' emotions. When listening to "The White-Haired Girl," "Blood and Tears," and "A Humble Woman," many people cried sadly. Some trainees immediately went to the staff in their sections to complain about their suffering.

    As the trainees had a preliminary awakening, accusation meetings were held in all eight sections. Through complaining, they gradually broke down their concerns, eliminated the idea of relying on bosses and madams, and further realized who had created endless pain for them. Therefore, they demanded that the madams and bosses who oppressed and exploited them be punished to avenge them.

    On January 19th, at the accusation meeting held at Houmachang, when the victims, Lu Jinfang and others, personally put shackles and handcuffs on the heinous boss and madam "Mother Tiger" and "Living阎王," and the Public Security Bureau stated that it would accept everyone's request and send these two to the People's Court for legal punishment, shouts of "Thank Chairman Mao" and "Thank the People's Government" shook the entire auditorium like a storm. From then on, the trainees further recognized that the People's Government was truly vindicating and avenging them, and their attitude towards the staff became more kind and trusting.

    Cultural and recreational activities are one of the important weapons to improve the trainees' thinking. After watching "Sunrise," they said, "If it weren't for liberation, wouldn't we end up like Chen Bailu, Cui Xi, and Little Thing?" The "Nine-Tailed Fox," which depicts the liberation of farmers, had an even greater educational impact on everyone.

    The trainees' creativity is very rich. They use various forms to compose songs and plays to express their feelings. Plays such as "Bitterness Ends, Sweetness Comes," "Jumping Out of the Fire Pit," and "Rebirth," as well as many clappers, crosstalks, ditties, and collective dances, vividly depict the dark life in the brothels and the bestial cruelty of the bosses and madams, the shameless atrocities of the Chiang Kai-shek wounded soldiers and local bullies; at the same time, they also express how they have worked hard to transform themselves under the education of the People's Government.

    Praising and Encouraging at Any Time Cultivated a Sense of Initiative
    The reformatory praised and encouraged every progress of the trainees, and always paid attention to cultivating their self-esteem and initiative. At the same time, female workers, female students, and medical workers in Beijing often wrote letters and sent stationery to them; literary and art workers and drama actors taught them to rehearse plays and sing songs. These sympathy and assistance also gave them supreme comfort and encouragement.

    The current education work has entered the stage of establishing a labor viewpoint. When they first entered the reformatory, they were all afraid of labor, especially the first-class prostitutes, who said that if they entered the factory, "Wouldn't people be exhausted?!" "How can we stand it?" After they heard revolutionary stories such as "Labor Hero Zhao Meiying," "Wang Xiuluan," "Unwavering Hou Wusao," and "Female District Chief Han Xiuzhen," they initially established a labor viewpoint and had the confidence to be reborn.

    Quit Smoking, Changed Clothes, Study Early, Meeting Late
    Combined with ideological education, each section gradually organized them to manage their daily lives, clean the courtyard, toilets, manage tea stoves, etc. In the exercise of collective life, they began to slowly change the bad habits brought from the old society. Many people quit opium and cigarettes, and changed into simple clothes. Now they get up at seven or eight in the morning and start self-study. There are fixed political studies, cultural studies, and recreational activities during the day, and group meetings in the evening. In addition to political studies, the trainees have also made significant progress in cultural studies. Many people who did not know a single character when they first entered the reformatory now recognize more than a thousand characters and can write letters and essays.

    Cured Venereal Diseases, Thank the Government
    The reformatory's heavy work—treating the trainees' venereal diseases—is nearing completion. When they first entered the reformatory, more than 90% of the total number of people suffered from syphilis, gonorrhea, and fourth venereal diseases. The People's Government spent more than 60 million yuan to purchase various medicines and invited more than 60 medical workers to treat them seriously. Now, their various venereal diseases have been gradually cured, and their spirits appear very happy and full! The trainees often said to the doctors and staff gratefully: "In the past, no one cared if we died of rotten diseases. Today, the People's Government spent so much money to cure us. We would be too sorry for Chairman Mao and the People's Government if we don't improve!" In addition, the government is very concerned about the health of the fifty or so children accommodated in the reformatory, and many young girls who contracted venereal diseases at the age of seven or eight due to being raped by brothel owners have also been cured.

    The entire treatment work is also a process of ideological education for the trainees. When they first entered the reformatory, they all said they were not sick, refused to see a doctor, and suspected whether the government was sincerely treating them. But when they saw that their diseases were really cured, their awareness was immediately raised, and they regarded the government, the staff, and the medical staff as benefactors.

    More than seventy reborn women in the reformatory have been discharged from the hospital one after another to get married or go home to produce. At the celebration meeting for the reunion of Zhang Xiulan and her husband, a couplet wrote out their true feelings: "The old society separated couples; Chairman Mao reunited mandarin ducks."

    Participate in Production, Reborn as New People
    Under the caring education and transformation of the reformatory, most of the trainees voluntarily requested to learn technology, preparing to go to the factory to work. The government has bought weaving machines and knitting machines for them, and will organize this group of reborn women to embark on a glorious production post. Yang Yunyu, the head of the reformatory, often told them: In the future, we must work hard to produce, start a family and become new people!

　　北京妇女教养院的改造妓女工作
    北京市妇女生产教养院成立至今已经两个多月了。一千三百多名受尽摧残剥削的姐妹们，在这里逐渐地医治了自己精神和肉体上的创伤，她们现在正受着人民政府的教养，在不久的将来这批新生的妇女就要光荣地投入生产战线了。
    全市妓女被集中在教养院的开始几天，她们有些人觉得非常兴奋愉快但大多仍怀有顾虑，而原来是头、二等的妓女，竟公开表示不满。有的甚至故意起哄，企图鼓动大家逃跑。
  解释政策  安定生活
    面对着这种情况，教养院初期的工作除耐心地给学员解释政策外，更集中精力安定她们的生活。工作人员日夜忙碌为大伙搞好伙食，安排床铺，生起火炉，小孩子、老母亲在家无人照料的给接到教养院里来，留在妓院的衣物原封不动的给取回来，害急病的送医院治疗。当学员们感到不但自己的生活获得解决，而且工作人员是那样热心地照顾体贴她们，使她们深深受了感动，情绪也就逐渐平稳下来了。
    安定她们生活以后，便对她们开始进行启发性教育。一千三百多学员在八个所里分别组成中队、班和小组，工作人员和学员生活在一起，了解她们的思想情况。她们因为长期受着精神和肉体的蹂躏，起初不愿诉说自己的惨痛遭遇，认为这是命里注定了的；对老板领家虽然十分仇恨，但总怕将来还要依靠他们，所以谁也不敢控诉他们的罪行。
  启发诉苦  控告领家
    针对着上述思想，教育工作的第一步便是揭发旧社会特别是妓院老板领家的罪恶，找出她们受苦的根源；并在上大课时讲述与她们生活相近的故事，打动学员的感情。在听“白毛女”、“血泪仇”和“一个下贱的女人”的时候，很多人悲伤地痛哭，有的学员立刻去找所内工作人员，向她们诉起苦来。
    由于学员们有了初步觉悟，八个所里先后都开了控诉会。经过诉苦，使她们逐渐打破了顾虑，消除了依靠老板、领家的念头，进而认识到是谁为她们制造了无边无岸的痛苦，于是她们要求惩办压迫她们剥削她们的领家老板，替她们报仇雪恨。
    一月十九日在后马场举行的控诉会上，当被害的学员卢金舫等亲手将脚镣手铐给罪恶滔天的老板领家“母老虎”和“活阎王”带上，公安局表示一定接受大家的要求把这二人送人民法院依法惩办的时候，“感谢毛主席”、“感谢人民政府”的欢呼声，像暴风雨一般震动了整个礼堂。学员们从此进一步认清了人民政府是真正为她们伸冤报仇的，对工作人员的态度也更加亲切和信赖了。
    文化娱乐活动是提高学员思想的重要武器之一。看了“日出”后，她们说：“要不是解放了，咱们还不是落个陈白露、翠喜和小东西的下场么？”描写农民翻身的“九尾狐”对大家的教育更为重大。
    学员们的创造力是很丰富的，她们采用多种多样的形式编歌编剧来表达自己感情。“苦尽甘来”、“跳出火坑”和“再生”等剧本，许多快板、双簧、小调和集体舞蹈，鲜明地刻划出妓院中暗无天日的生活与老板领家的兽性摧残，蒋匪伤兵和地痞流氓的无耻暴行；同时，她们也表达出在人民政府的教养下，如何努力地改造了自己。
    随时表扬鼓励  培养了进取心
    院部对学员的每一点进步，都给以表扬和鼓励，随时注意培养她们的自尊心和进取心。同时，北京的女工、女学生和医务工作者常给她们写信，送文具；文艺工作者和戏剧演员们教给她们排戏唱歌。这些同情和援助，也曾给她们以无上的安慰和鼓舞。
    目前教育工作已经进入树立劳动观点的阶段。才入教养院时，她们都害怕劳动，特别是头等妓女，表示将来进了工厂“可不把人累死？！”“那怎么受得了呢？”等到她们听到“劳动英雄赵梅英”、“王秀鸾”、“坚贞不屈的侯五嫂”和“女区长韩秀贞”等革命故事以后，使她们初步树立了劳动观点，有了重新做人的心信。
    戒了烟，改了装，早学习，晚开会
    结合思想教育，各个所里并逐渐组织她们自己管理日常生活，打扫院子、厕所、管茶炉等。在集体生活的锻炼中，她们开始慢慢地改掉了从旧社会带来的坏习气。很多人戒了大烟、纸烟，改穿了朴素的衣服。现在她们清晨七、八点钟起床后就开始自习。白天有固定的政治学习、文化学习及娱乐活动，晚上开小组会。除了政治学习外，学员们文化学习也有显著的进步，刚入院时一字不识的，现在已有许多人认得一千多字，并能写信作文了。
    治好性病  感谢政府
    教养院一个繁重的工作——治疗学员的性病将近全部完成。刚入院时，她们患有梅毒、淋病和第四性病的竟达全体人数的百分之九十以上。人民政府曾支出六千余万元购买各种药品，邀请六十多名医务工作者给她们认真治病。现在，她们的各种性病，都已逐渐治好，她们的精神显得非常愉快饱满了！学员们常常对医生和工作人员感激地说：“以前我们害病烂死都没人管，今天人民政府花了这么多钱把我们治好，我们要不进步可太对不起毛主席和人民政府了！”此外，政府对收容在教养院的五十多个小孩的健康非常关心，许多幼女在七、八岁时因被领家老板强奸而染上性病的也都治好了。
    整个医治工作对学员也是个思想教育的过程。她们刚入院时，都说没病，拒绝就医，怀疑政府是否真心给她们治病。可是她们看到她们的病真的被治好时，觉悟随即提高了，她们把政府，把工作人员和医务人员看成了恩人。
    教养院已有七十多新生妇女先后出院结婚或回家生产。在庆祝张秀兰夫妻团圆的大会上，有副对联写出了她们的真情实感：“旧社会使夫妻分离；毛主席让鸳鸯重欢”。
    参加生产  重做新人
    在教养院这样关切地教育改造下，大部学员都自愿要求学习技术，准备进工厂做工。政府已为她们买了织布机和织袜机，将组织这批新生妇女走上光荣的生产岗位去。教养院负责人杨蕴玉时常告诉她们：今后要好好劳动生产，成家立业做新人！
