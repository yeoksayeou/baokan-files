　　Beijing All-Circles Representatives Conference Victoriously Concludes
    Resolution to Establish District People's Representative Conferences
    Approval of Review Opinions on One Hundred and Twenty Proposals
    The Assembly Sends Respectful Telegrams to Chairman Mao and Marshal Stalin
    [Beijing News] The Second Session of the Second Beijing All-Circles People's Representatives Conference, lasting three days, victoriously concluded yesterday (the 27th) at 5:30 PM. The main agenda item of yesterday's meeting was the discussion of proposals. The assembly approved the proposal review committee's opinions on the review and handling of one hundred and twenty proposals, and passed the "Resolution on the Establishment of District All-Circles People's Representative Conferences in Beijing," and passed two telegrams of respect to Chairman Mao and Marshal Stalin. After Chairman Peng Zhen delivered a concluding report on the discussion of the municipal work plan and budget estimate for 1950, the representatives spoke one after another, enthusiastically supporting Chairman Peng Zhen's report and resolutely expressing their determination to strive to realize the work plan and budget estimate of the Beijing Municipal People's Government for 1950. Finally, Professor Xu Deheng delivered the closing address. The conference declared its conclusion amidst thunderous slogans.

    A total of three hundred and twenty-nine representatives attended yesterday's meeting. The executive chairpersons of the assembly were Yu Xinqing, Xiao Ming, Qian Duansheng, Xu Beihong, Fei Xiaotong, Li Jinxi, and Ma Yuhuai in the morning; and Nie Rongzhen, Zhang Youyu, Wu Han, Pu Jiexiu, Zhao Zichen, Liu Yifeng, and Chen Mingde in the afternoon. When discussing the representatives' proposals in the morning, Zhang Youyu, the general convener of the proposal review committee, first reported: "The assembly received a total of one hundred and twenty proposals, including five cases related to politics, law, and public security; thirty-one cases related to finance and economics; thirty-nine cases related to municipal administration and construction; twenty-seven cases related to culture, education, and health; eighteen cases related to social welfare and other categories; and five other cases that arrived late and were not reviewed in time, which can be handled by the proposers sending them to the consultation committee in the future, or directly contacting the government and other relevant departments. Among the one hundred and twenty cases, seventy-eight cases did not comply with the proposal rules. However, since the proposal rules were not clearly announced at this meeting, and the content of such proposals is mostly rich in positive construction, the review committee decided to review them all leniently, but no precedents should be set in the future." Subsequently, the conveners of the proposal review committee's various groups, Dong Ruqin, Cheng Hongyi, Liang Sicheng, Yu Xinqing, and Ma Yuhuai, respectively reported on the review opinions of the five categories of proposals: politics, law, and public security; finance and economics; municipal administration and construction; culture, education, and health; and social welfare and others. After discussion by the assembly, all the representatives unanimously passed the review committee's opinions on the proposals, including "Calling on citizens and all institutions, factories, and schools to use vacant land to grow vegetables," "Continuing to adjust labor-management relations to ensure the completion of the 1950 production plan," "Requesting the Industry Bureau, Commerce Bureau, and banks, in conjunction with the Federation of Industry and Commerce, to systematically guide floating capital towards production," "Street cooperatives should improve their operations and stock more daily necessities," "Requesting the government to continue storing food to stabilize grain prices and maintain people's food supply," "With the establishment of amateur schools, the government should systematically eliminate illiteracy in a short period of time," "Requesting public health departments to pay special attention to the environmental sanitation of the Shijingshan area," and all one hundred and twenty proposals.
