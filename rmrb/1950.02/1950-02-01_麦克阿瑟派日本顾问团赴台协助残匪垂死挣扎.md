Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, January 31st: According to reliable sources, in order to assist the Kuomintang remnant bandit gang in continuing its struggle in Taiwan, MacArthur dispatched a Japanese advisory group of fifteen Japanese to Taiwan in December of last year. The group is currently secretly discussing with the bandits a plan to organize a so-called "Japanese Volunteer Army" to come to Taiwan to participate in the bandit's counter-revolutionary war. According to a Reuters dispatch from Hong Kong on the 5th of this month, many senior Japanese army and navy officers in Taiwan held a series of meetings with bandit chiefs Chiang Kai-shek, Chen Cheng, and others to discuss the defense of Taiwan. At the same time as the Japanese advisory group arrived in Taiwan, Ho Shih-li, the bandit "Supply Commander of the Southeast Military and Political Office," and Tung Hsien-kuang, Chiang's "News Advisor," also went to Japan in late December of last year, staying in Japan for several weeks before returning to Taipei in mid-January. According to foreign news agency reports, one of Ho and Tung's tasks in Japan was to recruit a "Japanese Volunteer Army." According to a Dentsu dispatch from Tokyo on December 19th of last year, the war criminal of the invasion of China, former commander of the Japanese North China Dispatch Army, Neji Okamura, had already arrived in Taiwan in July of last year to be responsible for planning the recruitment of Japanese air force personnel.

　　麦克阿瑟派日本顾问团赴台协助残匪垂死挣扎
    【新华社北京三十一日电】确息：为了援助国民党残余匪帮继续在台湾进行挣扎，麦克阿瑟已于去年十二月间派遣包括十五位日人的日本顾问团至台湾。该团现正与匪方秘密商订组织所谓“日本志愿军”到台参加匪方反革命战争的计划。据路透社本月五日香港消息透露：在台的许多高级日本陆海军军官曾与匪首蒋介石、陈诚等人举行一连串会议，商谈台湾的防御问题。与日本顾问团抵台的同时，匪“东南军政长官公署供应司令”何世礼及蒋贼“新闻顾问”董显光亦于去年十二月下旬赴日，在日逗留数周，始于本月中旬返回台北。据外国通讯社消息透露，何、董赴日的任务之一即是招募“日本志愿军”。按据电通社去年十二月十九日东京消息揭露：侵华战争罪犯前日本华北派遣军司令根本博早于去年七月即已抵达台湾，负责筹划招募日空军人员事宜。
