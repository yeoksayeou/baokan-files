Xinhua News Agency, Dalian, 17th. The people of Lüda have long awaited the outcome of the Sino-Soviet talks, and it has finally arrived. On the morning of the 15th, after the Beijing Central People's Broadcasting Station broadcast the news, large portraits of Marshal Stalin and Chairman Mao were hung on the Lüda Administrative Office Building. The Chinese and Soviet national flags were raised high on Stalin Square, and then red flags fluttered in the streets and alleys. At noon, the broadcast vehicles of the Lüda Sino-Soviet Friendship Association and the propaganda vehicles of the General Trade Union set out one after another, and the waist drum team of the Lüda Cultural Troupe also appeared joyfully on the road. In the afternoon, teams of propaganda and parade marchers passed one after another on the wide and flat roads. Laughing people chatted about this epoch-making new event by the streets and on the trams. After listening to the broadcast, the workers of the Sino-Chang Railway Factory expressed that they would work hard to produce and create new records to support this great treaty. Female train co-driver Tian Guiying and others worked the night shift, and when they heard the Beijing Radio broadcast the Sino-Soviet Treaty, they did not sleep and listened to the broadcast. After lunch, she went to do the Yangko dance with others. Tian Guiying said, "We learned to be drivers with the help of Soviet comrades, but my skills are still very poor. I will work harder to learn from Soviet comrades before they leave here." Zhang Xinting, Deputy Director of the Dalian Railway Bureau, also expressed his determination to learn the Soviet Union's overall experience in railway management before the Soviet comrades leave, and to strengthen the professional study of leading cadres and the technical study of workers. Thousands of workers from the Dalian Shipyard marched in teams to celebrate after finishing work in the afternoon without even eating. After listening to the broadcast, the workers of the Far East Electric Glass Factory and the Dalian Electrochemical Factory immediately held a forum to express everyone's feelings. More than a thousand middle school students participating in the middle school winter vacation academy lecture at the Cultural Palace heard about the signing of the new Sino-Soviet Friendship Treaty, and the whole venue immediately erupted in revelry, with songs rising one after another. The cheers of "Long live Marshal Stalin" and "Long live Chairman Mao" were continuous. In the evening, the Lüda Administrative Office held a celebration meeting for more than two thousand cadres, and representatives from the Soviet Army Command stationed in Lushunkou also attended. The enthusiastic applause and cheers at the meeting reverberated outside the venue. At the meeting, Han Guang, Chairman of the Administrative Office, said: The fact that the Soviet army has been stationed in Lüda for four years according to the old Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship and Alliance shows that, due to the provisions of the treaty, the Lushun area has become a naval base for defending peace in the Far East, and the peaceful construction of Lüda has been carried out with the help of the Soviet army. He called for strengthening internationalist education, eliminating all forms of narrow nationalism, further consolidating Sino-Soviet friendship, and seizing the time to earnestly learn from Soviet friends. Soviet military representative Major General Razkov said at the meeting: The Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance and the other two agreements will not only be deeply satisfied by the entire Soviet people, but also by all friends of peace, democracy and progress.

    【新华社大连十七日电】旅大人民久已期待着中苏会谈的结果终于到来了。十五日早晨，当北京中央人民广播电台播送出这一消息后，旅大行署大楼上随即挂起了斯大林大元帅和毛主席的大幅画像。斯大林广场上高高升起中苏两国国旗，接着大街小巷红旗招展。中午，旅大中苏友协的广播车、总工会的宣传车先后出动，旅大文工团的腰鼓队也欢跃地出现在马路上。午后，在宽阔平坦的路上宣传和游行的队伍一队队的接踵而过。欢笑的人们，在街道旁、电车上，交谈着这一划时代的新事件。中长铁路工厂工友们听完广播后，纷纷表示要努力生产和创造新纪录来拥护这个伟大条约，女火车副司机田桂英等当了一夜班，听说北京电台广播中苏条约，觉也不睡就听起广播来，吃过午饭，又和别人一同去扭秧歌了。田桂英说：“我们学司机是在苏联同志帮助下进行的，但我的技术还很差，我要在苏联同志未离开这里以前更加紧来学。”大连铁路局张心亭副局长也表示：决心在苏联同志没走前，学好苏联管理铁路的全盘经验，并加强领导干部的业务学习和工人的技术学习。大连修造船厂数千名工友，在下午放工后连饭也不吃就结队游行庆祝。远东电业玻璃工厂、大连电化工厂工友听完广播，马上召开座谈会，发表每人的感想。在文化宫参加中学寒假学园讲座的千多名中学生，听到签订了新的中苏友好条约，全场立刻卷入狂欢中，歌声此落彼起。“斯大林大元帅万岁”、“毛主席万岁”的欢呼连续不断。当晚，旅大行署并召开了二千余干部的庆祝会，驻旅顺口苏军司令部亦派代表参加。大会中热烈的掌声和欢呼震荡场外。会上，行署主席韩光说：四年来，苏军根据旧中苏友好同盟条约驻军旅大的事实说明，由于该条约的规定，旅顺地区成为保卫远东和平的海军基地，旅大的和平建设就是在苏军的帮助下进行的。他号召加强国际主义教育，扫清一切形式的狭隘民族主义，进一步巩固中苏友谊，抓紧时间切实地向苏联朋友学习。苏军代表拉兹克造夫少将在会上说：中苏友好同盟互助条约及其它两个协定，不仅得到全苏联人民，同时也将得到所有和平、民主与进步的友人们的深深的满意。
