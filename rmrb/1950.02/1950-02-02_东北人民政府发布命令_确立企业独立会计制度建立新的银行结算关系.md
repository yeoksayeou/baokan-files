　　Northeast People's Government Issues Order
    Establish Independent Accounting Systems for Enterprises and New Bank Settlement Relationships
    [This Newspaper's Dispatch] In order to implement an independent accounting system and establish a new settlement system, the Northeast People's Government issued an order on January 10th. The full text is as follows:

    Regarding the Implementation of Independent Accounting Systems and the Establishment of New Settlement Systems

    1. After the complete liberation of Northeast China in 1949, it was stipulated that all cash and material transfers between major financial and economic departments should be handled through a centralized allocation and settlement system by the various ministries and then by the General Accounting Bureau. This was a transitional measure. Now, in order to establish an independent accounting system, strengthen economic accounting, accelerate capital turnover, and adapt to new construction tasks, it is decided to end this system by the end of this year. In 1950, all enterprise departments must implement an independent accounting system and conduct independent economic activities under the overall economic plan. The Northeast Bank will be responsible for cash management, short-term credit, and the settlement center.

    2. In the future, all financial and economic departments and enterprise units with independent accounting must establish contracts for all buying and selling transactions according to the plan, and submit a copy to the bank for record. Neither party shall directly engage in various borrowing and lending relationships, nor shall they directly exchange cash. Both parties must settle accounts with the bank based on the contract. For example: If Company A purchases goods from Factory B according to a contract or plan, Company A shall issue a transfer notice to Company B within its bank deposit limit. The bank will then transfer the payment to Factory B's deposit account based on the transfer notice. If Company A's payable amount exceeds its deposit amount, it must first request a credit loan from the bank. The bank will then decide whether to grant short-term turnover based on its production plan, financial situation, creditworthiness, and loan purpose, etc., but it must be handled in accordance with the regulations and returned when due.

    3. Long-term investments and short-term turnover of various enterprise departments must be strictly separated: All long-term investments shall be uniformly allocated by the Ministry of Finance according to the plan, and supervised and managed. No enterprise shall transfer funds from long-term investments for use as production turnover funds; If it is short-term turnover, the Northeast Bank will handle it through credit procedures.

    4. In order to stabilize prices next year, it is decided to strengthen cash management. All cash of all public enterprises and institutions must be deposited in the local Northeast Bank. No one shall privately retain cash exceeding the amount used on that day (those without local banks shall not exceed the amount used for half a month to one month). Violators will be punished in accordance with financial discipline. The Ministry of Finance and the bank have the right to check the inventory cash of various enterprises and institutions at any time to see if it complies with the regulations. As for the cash required by various economic units, they should earnestly prepare a cash income and expenditure plan in the first ten days of the budget month, and submit it to the relevant competent departments and local banks for review; both parties will send the results of the review to the Ministry of Finance and the Northeast Bank Head Office to compile the Northeast Cash Plan, which will be submitted to the government for approval, and then handed over to the bank for supervision. As for the cash plans of agencies and enterprises in various provinces and cities, they shall be reviewed and summarized by the local finance department and the local branch, approved by the local provincial and municipal governments, and handed over to the bank for execution. Various financial and economic departments, without a cash plan, even if they have bank deposits, cannot be paid in cash.

    5. The above measures are important reforms in the accounting system, credit system, and enterprise management system. The government directs all financial and economic departments to make full mobilization and preparation, and to formulate various specific measures to ensure the implementation of the above measures.
          Chairman Gao Gang
        Vice Chairmen Li Fuchun, Lin Feng, Gao Chongmin

　　东北人民政府发布命令
    确立企业独立会计制度建立新的银行结算关系
    【本报讯】东北人民政府为实行独立会计制度及建立新的结算制度，特于一月十日发布命令，兹将原文发表如次：
    关于实行独立会计制度及建立新的结算制度
    一、一九四九年东北全部解放后曾规定各主要财经部门之间的一切现金与物资调拨，概采取经由各部汇总再由总会计局集中调拨结算的会计制度，原系过渡性质。现为确立独立会计制度，加强经济核算，加速资金周转，适应新的建设任务，决定至本年底结束此种制度。一九五○年所有企业部门概须实行独立会计制度，在总的经济计划下，进行独立的经济活动。并由东北银行担负现金管理，短期信贷及结算中心。
    二、今后所有财政经济部门与独立会计之企业单位，一切买卖往来，均必须按计划订立合同，并以副本一份送交银行备查。双方不得直接发生各种借贷关系，亦不得用现金直接交换。双方必须根据合同到银行结算。例如：甲公司按合同或计划购买乙工厂物品，则由甲公司在其银行存款额内开出转账通知书给乙公司，银行则根据转账通知书将货款转入乙工厂存款账内。假如甲公司应付货款超过存款额时，须事先请求银行给以信用贷款，银行则考察其生产计划，财务状况，信用程度及贷款用途等决定予以短期周转，但必须是按章办理，到期归还。
    三、各企业部门的长期投资与短期周转，必须严格分开：凡属长期投资，统一由财政部按计划拨付，并进行监督与管理，任何企业均不得以长期投资之款项，移作生产周转资金；如系短期周转，概由东北银行以信贷手续办理。
    四、为了稳定明年物价，决定加强现金管理。所有一切公营企业及机关现金均须存在当地东北银行，不得私自保留现金超过当日的使用量（当地无银行者不得超过半月到一月之使用量），违者依财政纪律论处。财政部与银行有权力随时检查各企业机关的库存现金，是否合乎规定。至于各经济单位需要之现金，应按规定在预算月的前十天，切实编造现金收支计划，分别送交各该主管部门及当地银行审查；双方均将审核结果送财政部及东北银行总行编成东北现金计划，呈报本政府核批，然后再交由银行监督执行。至于各省市的机关企业的现金计划均由当地财政厅及当地分行审核汇总由当地省市政府核批，交由银行执行。各财政经济部门，无现金计划，虽有银行存款，不能予以支付现金。
    五、以上办法乃会计制度，信贷制度，及企业管理制度上的重要改革。本府责成各财经主管部门必须作充分动员与准备，并制订各种具体办法，保证上述办法之执行。
          主席  高岗
        副主席  李富春、林枫、高崇民
