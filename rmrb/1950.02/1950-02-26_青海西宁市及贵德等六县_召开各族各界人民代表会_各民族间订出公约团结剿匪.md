Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, February 24th: In the past month, Xining City in Qinghai Province, as well as Guide, Minhe, Datong, Huangzhong, Ledu, and Huzhu counties, successively convened people's representative conferences from all ethnic groups. The conferences in various regions focused on discussing issues such as ethnic unity and the elimination of bandits and secret agents. In Minhe County, at a conference attended by 130 representatives from various ethnic groups (Hui, Han, Tibetan) and all sectors of society, a covenant on ethnic unity was drafted: 1. Prohibit disrespectful terms such as "Hui zi" and "Fan zi"; 2. Promote the spirit of mutual ethnic assistance and fraternity, raise vigilance, and prevent bad people from stirring up discord; 3. Discuss matters together and help each other solve problems. Regarding the work of eliminating bandits and secret agents, the participating representatives unanimously agreed that the emphasis should be on in-depth propaganda and strengthening political efforts to disintegrate them through various forms, supplemented by military suppression; and that village-to-village joint defense should be established, and self-defense teams should be organized on a voluntary basis to carry out tasks such as night patrols and sentry duty. The People's Representative Conference of Guide County, in addition to discussing issues such as unity and bandit suppression, also resolved the land disputes between the Tibetan and Hui ethnic groups in the Maoqugou and Gaohongya areas caused by Ma Bufang's bandit gang before liberation. At the representative conference in Huangzhong County, discussions were held on how to strengthen agricultural production and correct the destructive behavior of landlords and rich peasants who were indulging in extravagant eating and drinking, as well as the tendency of some poor and hired peasants to passively wait for land distribution. Through the people's representative conferences, various ethnic groups were united, democracy was promoted, and cadres and the masses were educated. Representatives in some areas criticized the subjectivism and bureaucratic style of a few cadres and put forward many valuable suggestions to the government, enabling the government to further connect with people from all ethnic groups and all walks of life. The standing committees of the People's Representative Conferences of Xining City and Huzhu, Minhe, Huangzhong and other places have been leading representatives to go deep into the countryside after the meetings, conveying the resolutions of the meetings, assisting rural work, mediating ethnic disputes, strengthening ethnic unity, and urging public security groups to thoroughly eliminate bandits and secret agents. Huzhu County has done the best in this regard. In order to implement the resolutions, Minhe County formed a propaganda team of more than 20 people to go to the countryside to educate the masses. On the 14th of last month, the Fourth District of Huangzhong County convened the Second Farmers' Representative Conference to discuss methods for implementing the resolutions of the county's people's representative conference of all ethnic groups, and decided to organize a militia self-defense team and strive to complete the task of paying good grain, among other proposals. The Standing Committee of the People's Representative Conference of All Circles in Xining City assisted the government in carrying out relief work, benefiting more than 900 people.
