Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 16th: The people of Shenyang City, filled with gratitude and excitement, celebrated the great news of the signing of the new Sino-Soviet treaty and agreements during the Spring Festival. Staff members of newspaper offices, news agencies, and radio stations worked through the night to disseminate this gospel to the people. The city's four newspaper offices printed more than 250,000 copies of newspapers yesterday and sent them to various parts of Northeast China. Audiences with over 80,000 radios in the city also listened to the sound of this great historical document. The news spread like electricity to every factory workshop, office, conference hall, classroom, shop, and household. Trucks from the newspaper offices distributing extras were chased by groups of people on the streets. Blackboards and slogan leaflets of various kinds suddenly appeared in the streets and alleys. People, unable to restrain their joy, performed on the main thoroughfares. At 11 a.m., the Yangko team of more than 500 people from the Lu Xun Academy of Arts and the Red Lantern Waist Drum team performed everywhere in the city. They were surrounded by bustling crowds, causing laughter, songs, and slogans everywhere. On this day, large-scale Yangko teams were also dispatched from units such as the Northeast Workers' Political University, China Medical University, and the Shenyang Railway Bureau Staff College. Enthusiastic residents of Aimin Street in Heping District also formed their children into a Yangko team to perform their innocent dances. All production units and work departments used every possible method to quickly spread this good news. Celebration meetings and symposiums were also held enthusiastically in various places. All cadres of the Cultural and Educational Department of the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions quickly went to major factories throughout the city to carry out propaganda. After listening to the broadcast, teachers and students of the Municipal Fourth Middle School went to the homes of citizens to spread the good news. All newspaper delivery workers of the Shenyang Municipal Post Office automatically increased their night shifts to transmit this news to every corner as quickly as possible. All factories, more than twenty in the entire city, held celebration meetings or symposiums yesterday. Workers enthusiastically expressed that they would celebrate this good news with hard work and production. Workers in the Second Manufacturing Department of the Machinery Factory read the extra while looking at the more than one hundred brand-new Soviet machines in front of them. They said excitedly: "In the past, it was common to make mistakes when making precision work with Japanese lathes, but since using Soviet lathes, we haven't had a single error." Xing Pengcheng, an old technical worker at Machine Factory No. 1, said, "With the help of the Soviet big brother, our factory has now been equipped with new machines. After the signing of the new treaty and agreements this time, the recovery and development of our industry will be even faster." Ba Junshan, a riveter at the factory, said, "The problem now is that we have to work hard. I must put all my strength into it!" A letter from the celebration meeting of the Shenyang Smelting Plant to Chairman Mao and Marshal Stalin stated: "In order to celebrate the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance, we will definitely guarantee that the production of blister copper will reach 166% of the total monthly task by the end of February, and the production of electrolytic copper will reach 158.8%, in order to thank you for your wise leadership." At 2 p.m. on the 15th, when the extra of the Sino-Soviet Joint Communiqué appeared on the streets for the second time, the national flags of China and the Soviet Union were already flying on the tops of major buildings throughout the city. Red star lanterns, colorful flags, archways, and slogans decorated this city, which was immersed in a festive atmosphere, even more beautifully. The marching crowds and Yangko teams spread the song "Stalin, We Stand on Your Side" throughout the city.
