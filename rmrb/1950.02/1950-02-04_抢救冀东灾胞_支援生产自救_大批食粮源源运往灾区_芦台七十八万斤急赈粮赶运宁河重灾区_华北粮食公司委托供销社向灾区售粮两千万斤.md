　　Rescuing the People of Jidong Affected by the Disaster, Supporting Production and Self-Salvation
    Large Quantities of Food are Continuously Shipped to the Disaster Area
    780,000 Jin of Emergency Relief Grain from Lutai is Rushed to Ninghe, a Heavily Affected Area
    North China Grain Company Entrusts Supply and Marketing Cooperatives to Sell 20 Million Jin of Grain to the Disaster Area
    [Our newspaper's special dispatch from Baoding] 780,000 jin of emergency relief grain is being transported from Lutai Town to the heavily affected area of Ninghe County. The first batch of 140,000 jin has arrived in the third district of Ninghe and distribution to disaster-stricken households has begun. In order to complete this arduous task of emergency transportation, the Ninghe County Rescue and Disaster Relief Committee, with the assistance of the Ning, Bao, Ji, and Yu Disaster Relief Committees, has established a Rescue and Disaster Relief Grain Transportation Committee, responsible for organizing transportation forces and inspecting all problems during transportation. Because the ice and snow are melting, the committee decided to seize the time and rush the transportation directly to the villages, instead of transporting it to the base villages. Regarding transportation vehicles, more than 400 vehicles were mobilized from the disaster area of Ninghe, and 100 rubber-wheeled carts were hired from Lutai Town. When the transportation workers heard that they were sending relief grain, they all offered to reduce transportation prices. They said to the transportation committee, "Other counties are also supporting our disaster area, so we should help even more!" The porters were even more active, loading more than 1,100 bags in only eight hours at night, weighing them, sewing them up, and carrying them to the departure point.
    [Our newspaper's special dispatch from Baoding] In order to supply grain to the disaster area, stabilize grain prices in the disaster area, and support the people in the disaster area to help themselves through production, the North China Grain Company signed a contract with the Hebei Province Tianjin Special District Supply and Marketing Cooperative on January 23, entrusting the cooperative to sell 20 million jin of food grain to the disaster area (half red grain and half corn). The contract stipulated that the cooperative should complete the shipment of grain from Tianjin within one month, pay the grain payment in four installments on a monthly basis, and complete the settlement by the end of May. The grain price would be paid according to the market price in Tianjin on that day, less 5 percent. The supply and marketing cooperative would also use 70,000 reed mats as exchange, equivalent to 800,500 jin of corn. The supply and marketing cooperative immediately instructed the county cooperatives to organize all transportation forces to rush the grain, and regarded grain sales as a serious political task for production and disaster relief; at the same time, it actively purchased the products of the disaster victims to increase the purchasing power of the masses, and used preferential treatment for members to absorb a large number of people into the cooperative.

　　抢救冀东灾胞  支援生产自救
    大批食粮源源运往灾区
    芦台七十八万斤急赈粮赶运宁河重灾区
    华北粮食公司委托供销社向灾区售粮两千万斤
    【本报保定专电】七十八万斤急赈粮正自芦台镇运往宁河县重灾区，首批十四万斤已运抵宁河三区，并着手向灾户发放。为完成这次艰巨的抢运任务，宁河县在宁、宝、蓟、玉救灾委员会协助下，成立了抢运救灾粮委员会，负责组织运输力量和检查运输中的一切问题。因冰雪正在溶解，该委员会决定争取时间，迅速抢运，直接运到村，不再运往基点村。运输车辆，计动员起宁河灾区四百余辆，并从芦台镇雇用胶皮车一百辆。运输工人听说要送救灾粮，均纷纷提出减低运价，他们向抢运委员会说：“别县还支援咱们灾区哩，咱们就更应该帮助了！”搬运工人更积极，夜间只用八个钟头就装好了一千一百多袋，并过好秤缝好口，背往起运地点。
    【本报保定专电】华北粮食公司为供应灾区粮食，稳定灾区粮价，支援灾胞生产自救，于一月二十三日与河北省天津专区供销总社订立委托该社向灾区代售食粮两千万斤的合同（红粮玉米各半），规定该社在一个月内由天津将粮食起运完毕，粮款按月分四次交付，至五月底清理完竣，粮价按津市当日市价低百分之五交款；并由供销社以七万张席子作为交换，折合玉米八十万零五千斤。该供销社当即指示各县社组织一切运输力量赶运粮食，把售粮作为生产救灾的严肃的政治任务；同时积极收购灾民生产品，以提高群众购买力。并以优待社员办法大量吸收群众入社。
