　　Urgent Need to Study Chairman Mao's Speech at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art
    Wang Chaowen
    A reader's letter in a literary magazine reveals that his understanding of Chairman Mao's speech at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art is still insufficient. He believes that the direction has long been settled, and all that's left is to get to work. Overemphasizing the study of principles while neglecting creative practice turns the learning process into a waste of energy. Yes, it's wrong to only talk and not act. Even to thoroughly understand principles, one must strive in life and creation; otherwise, it's difficult to grasp them completely, let alone concretize and develop them. But generally speaking, is emphasizing the study of principles excessive? Have literary and art workers mastered the principles sufficiently? No, far from it. Anyone who disregards this timeless document that addresses literary and art issues with Marxism-Leninism, who doesn't connect it to reality in all aspects to understand its fundamental spirit, and who doesn't apply it to all literary and art work, then even if he is working hard, his work is likely to be blind and unproductive.

    The vast majority of revolutionary literary and art workers, both old and new, respect this document and are enthusiastic about studying it. But this doesn't mean that there aren't a few who belittle the study of the document. Some don't understand the guiding role of this document for literary and art work (and all work), or think they've already learned enough, or believe that the issues addressed in the document are irrelevant to them. Approaching the idea of "already learned enough" often appears among some literary and art workers.

    Certain art workers who possess realistic techniques but lack a correct understanding and a correct stance, viewpoint, and method for reflecting reality declare: "I've always been a realist. As long as I have the opportunity to be familiar with life, I believe I can create works that the masses love to see." What attitude is used to apply realistic techniques? Does this realistic technique equal realism? How to have a clear position of the people? How to grasp themes that can advance the new society? How to maximize the educational effect of works on the masses? All are vague. This distorted view of realism is essentially a manifestation of a bourgeois, purely technical viewpoint, that is, an emotional rejection of thoroughly transforming oneself. Can you say that such friends don't need to study the new literary and art principles well?

    Some friends who have long buried themselves in meticulous traditional figure paintings haven't realized that the techniques of meticulous painting aren't equal to the basic conditions for the masses' enjoyment. "My style has always been popular. As long as you print more of my works, they can be popularized." He sees popularization as a simple technical issue, not understanding that popularization isn't simple vulgarization. He doesn't understand that one must first learn the thoughts and feelings of the masses, "transform" oneself from the masses' thoughts and feelings, and then "transform" them into the masses. He doesn't understand that if this argument is developed, the techniques of calendar posters will be regarded as the main condition for popularization work. Who can say that such friends don't need to study the new literary and art principles of serving the masses and how to serve them?

    On the issue of raising standards and popularizing, the principle of raising standards on the basis of popularization and popularization under the guidance of raising standards hasn't been specifically applied to work. On the contrary, raising standards is understood out of context, distorting the principle of raising standards. It is believed that forms like oil paintings are the standard of high quality, and large-scale orchestral music and color films are the standard of raising standards. At the same time, mass new art, even in its nascent state, is viewed statically and compared mechanically with the selections of the feudal and bourgeois periods and the socialist art of the thirty-plus years of revolution, leading to the conclusion that "after all, the works of the ancients and foreigners are better," negating the mass progressive significance of the current new art of new China. Other friends, on the contrary, vulgarly understand popularization, believing that popularization is catering to low-level appreciation abilities or appreciation habits, ignoring the healthy main factors in the masses' works, and inappropriately praising their primitive or relatively backward methods of expression. Doesn't this kind of left and right leaning, inappropriate understanding of the principle of raising standards and popularizing illustrate that studying the document is an urgent need?

    Although a supra-class and detached-from-reality view of art hasn't openly prevailed, it can be seen from those slogans that are "starting from scratch," and the formalism of the decadent period of the bourgeoisie in creation, replacing the new art of serving workers, peasants, and soldiers with foreign stereotypes, and from the remarks of "studying politics doesn't necessarily lead to creation" and indifference to the study of Marxism-Leninism, isn't this an objective basis for the urgent need to study the new literary and art principles well?

    If it is thought that these examples aren't well-known, then please look at the debate in Shanghai's Wenhui Daily in August and September about whether intellectuals and the petty bourgeoisie can be the protagonists in literary and art works and whether they can be written about. Among them, some opinions emphasize how to write but neglect what to write, advocate not writing about what is unfamiliar but neglect taking the initiative to become familiar with what should be written, and the special concern and confusion about this issue can prove that studying Mao Zedong's literary and art principles is not only needed but is urgently needed.

    Principles aren't slogans or empty clauses. To test whether one has learned enough, it depends on whether he has truly understood the spirit and essence of the principles and unconditionally implements these principles in action. The actual situation doesn't conform to the ideal so well. Even comrades who studied Mao Zedong's literary and art principles seven years ago aren't all able to conform to the principles of stance, viewpoint, attitude, work, and method instructed by Comrade Mao Zedong when handling any problem. For example, the theme of a work can't predict the future development of reality but stops at the enumeration of phenomena; the theme of a work can't propose and solve problems as timely as the Communist Party's policies, or even if it is willing to catch up with the development of reality, it lags behind reality. It can't be said that this is mainly due to the insufficient understanding and effort in studying Marxism-Leninism and policies called for by Comrade Mao Zedong. On the current literary and art front, works that thoroughly familiarize themselves with workers, peasants, and soldiers and make vivid descriptions and can guide the actual struggle aren't very common; formulaic and conceptualized works lacking vivid images haven't disappeared; even today, there are still a few comrades who, on the grounds of their own studies, emphasize the honing of personal skills and to a certain extent ignore the more important responsibility of educating young cadres in large numbers; and there are also a few comrades who feel panic in the face of the highly skilled Soviet art, without analyzing the actual process of Soviet art development, regretting that they didn't work hard on improving their skills in the past because they did too much popularization work; individual comrades neglect the achievements made by the old liberated areas in correctly implementing literary and art principles, just as the bias of emphasizing the study of folk art and completely negating Western art, after entering the city, they neglect the experience and achievements of transforming Yangge, folk songs, New Year pictures, and ballad drumming in the past seven years, and inappropriately emphasize Western techniques. These, although not universally present, can't be said to be extremely harmful tendencies that violate Chairman Mao's literary and art principles. Can you say that these comrades whose mass viewpoints and artistic viewpoints aren't sound or not consolidated enough have studied the principles too much?

    If we expand the scope of literary and art cadres, the problem becomes even more serious. According to Wang Dabing's "My Opinions on the Old New Year Picture Bookstore in Taiyuan City" published in the Shanxi Daily on January 8, the problems existing among old artists are not simple. According to the statistics in the article, there are as many as 67 kinds of poisonous New Year pictures appearing in Taiyuan City alone. Please look at the corrupt names of "The Latest Twenty-Four Filial Piety Pictures," "Heaven-Given Wealth," "Ji Gong Living Buddha Saving the World," "Kui Xing Points the Top Scholar," "Shanghai Modern Girl," "Pitying Oneself in the Mirror," "Bathing in Orchid Soup," and "Spring Colors Annoy People." You can imagine how corrupt their content is. This can also prove that in the literary and artistic thoughts of a large number of folk artists, besides feudal, colonial, erotic, and petty-bourgeois tastes, and the motive of only caring about sales and not being responsible for propaganda and education, what else is there? If you look at the new comic strips published in Shanghai, you can also prove their urgent need to study. Although there are many with good content and form, there are still many who haven't gotten rid of the old traditions and old styles that should be gotten rid of, and use the taste of gods and monsters to oppose superstition. Even in the reform of old operas, although there have been many achievements, most are still in the clutches of old operas. Even if new operas are being performed, there are still those who cater to the petty-bourgeois tastes, disregard serious content, flaunt personal beauty, and habitually add some unnecessary gimmicks, thereby harming the effect of the theme. From this, it can be seen that old artists urgently need to be transformed. A large number of cadres are needed to undertake the transformation work, and these cadres can't complete the task well without first mastering the principles.

    The situation in the literary and art circles has changed in the past seven years, but the progress of a large number of literary and art workers hasn't lessened the role of studying "Speech at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art." On the contrary, due to the more complex struggles and the expansion of the front, this timeless document has become more important. Yes, intensifying the study of literary and art principles will affect the quantity of creation in a certain period, but this hindrance is necessary and beneficial to a certain kind of creation that doesn't stand on the position of the people. Yes, the study of principles can't stop at reading documents. If it stops at reciting documents or repeating the slogan "Serve the People" like chanting scriptures without connecting to practical problems, the spirit of the document can't be learned, and it can't be hoped to be brought into play. However, if you think that the "Speech at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art" is outdated, belittle its unparalleled guiding role, or are satisfied with a superficial understanding of this principle without studying this principle in all aspects, you will not only lose the role of a writer in the face of the leaping reality, but also run the risk of being abandoned by reality, at least the risk of falling behind. The entire literary and art circles, like the development of the revolutionary situation, will develop by leaps and bounds under the guidance of the proletarian vanguard's literary and art policy, but if individuals don't work hard, the most unfortunate thing is themselves. "Doing" is necessary, but studying literary and art principles is also a major part of "doing." As long as it is not scholastic or dogmatic study, it will help you "do" it more courageously and more effectively.

### 迫切需要学习毛主席在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话

　　迫切需要学习毛主席在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话
    王朝闻
    一个文艺杂志的读者投书中，显出他对于毛主席在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话的学习还很不够。他认为方针早就没有问题，干就行了。过分强调学习方针而放松了创作实践，这种学习就成为浪费精力的行为。是的，光说不做是不对的。——即使是为了彻底了解原则，不在生活上创作上努力，对于原则也不易彻底了解，更说不到原则之具体化和发展。但按照一般情况而论，强调学习方针是不是过分？文艺工作者是不是已经足够的掌握了方针？——没有，差得远。谁要是轻视这个不受时间限制的以马列主义来处理文艺问题的文件，不从各方面去联系实际以读懂文件的基本精神，不把它应用到一切文艺工作中去，那末，即使他在努力工作，这工作很可能是盲目的，干不出道理来的。
    不论新老的革命文艺工作者，绝大多数很尊重这文件，并热心学习；但不等于说，没有少数轻视文件学习的人。不了解这个文件对于文艺工作（以及一切工作）的指导作用，或者以为自己已经学够了，或者以为文件所针对的问题和自己无关，口头上承认这文件是指南针，实际并不认真学习，接近“已经学够了”的言论或想法，往往出现在某些文艺工作者中间。
    某些掌握着写实技法但缺乏正确认识并正确反映现实的立场观点和方法的美术工作者，他宣言：“我一贯就是现实主义者，只要有熟悉生活的机会，相信可以创造出群众喜闻乐见的东西。”用什么态度去运用写实手法？这种写实手法是否等于现实主义？如何才有明确的人民大众的立场？如何把握能够推进新社会前进的主题？如何才能够发挥作品对于群众之教育作用？一片模糊。这种曲解现实主义的论调，实质是资产阶级的纯技术观点的流露，也即是在情绪上拒绝彻底改造自己的表现。你能说这样的朋友不需要好好学习新文艺方针吗？
    有些长期埋头在工笔仕女画的朋友，他没认识到工笔画的技法并不是等于群众喜闻乐见的基本条件，——“我的作风本来就是大众化的，只要能给我多印些作品就能普及。”他把大众化看成简单的技术问题，不了解大众化不是简单的通俗化；不了解首先要学习大众的思想感情，自己首先从大众的思想感情“化”了过来才把它们“化”到大众中去的道理；不了解这种论调发展开来，就把月份牌的技法当成普及工作的主要条件。这样的朋友，谁能说他不需要学习为群众与如何为法的新文艺方针呢？
    在提高与普及问题上，没有把在普及基础上提高，提高指导下的普及这原则具体运用到工作中去，相反的断章取义的理解提高，歪曲提高的原则。以为油画之类的形式就是高的标准，大规模的管弦乐、彩色电影就是提高的标准。同时，静止的看待发展中的即令是萌芽状态中的群众新艺术，机械的把他和封建阶级资产阶级盛期的选品以及革命三十多年的社会主义艺术品相比较而得出“到底还是古人的、外国的作品好”之结论，取消了当前新中国新艺术之群众性的进步的意义。另一些朋友，相反的庸俗的理解普及，以为普及就是迁就低级的欣赏能力或欣赏习惯，忽视群众作品中健康的主要因素而不适当的赞扬其原始性的或比较落后的表现方法。对于这两种左右倾的不适当理解提高与普及之原则的理论，不正说明学习文件是迫切的需要吗？
    超阶级的及以脱离实际的艺术观虽然没有或不敢公开流行，但从那些口号上是“从头学起”，创作上则不忘情于资产阶级没落期中的形式主义作风，把洋八股代替为工农兵服务的新艺术的“创作”，和“学习了政治不一定能进行创作”的、对马列主义学习冷淡的言论看来，难道不是迫切需要好好学习新文艺方针的客观根据吗？
    如果以为这些例子不是众所周知的，那末，请看八九月间上海文汇报关于知识分子、小资产阶级可不可以作为文艺作品中的主角及可不可以写的争论，其中某些强调如何写而忽视写什么，主张不熟知的不写而忽视主动去熟悉该写的等等意见，以及对于这一问题特别关心以至困惑的情况，就可以证明学习毛泽东文艺方针不但是需要而且是迫切的需要着。
    方针不是口号，不是空洞的条文，检验学够或不够，要看他是不是真正领会了方针的精神实质并在行动上无条件的执行这方针。实际情况并不如此符合理想，即令是七年前就学习过毛泽东文艺方针的同志，也并不是都能在处理任何问题时，都符合毛泽东同志所指示的立场、观点、态度、工作、方法诸原则的。比如说，作品的主题不能预示现实发展的前途，而止于现象的罗列；作品的主题不能像共产党的政策一样及时提出问题解决问题，或者即令愿意赶上现实发展但竟落后于现实；这不能不说主要由于对毛泽东同志所号召的学习马列主义、学习政策之理解与努力不足。现在的文艺战线上，比较透彻的熟悉工农兵并作生动的描写和能指导现实斗争的作品还不十分普遍；缺乏生动形象的公式主义的概念化的作品还未绝迹；到今天，竟然还有少数的同志，以自己的学习为理由，强调个人技术的磨练而在一定程度上忽视了比较重要的、大量教育年青干部的责任；也还有少数同志在具有高度技法的苏联艺术之前感到惶恐，而不分析苏联艺术发展的实际过程，后悔自己过去因为做多了普及工作而没有在提高技术上努力；个别同志忽视老解放区正确执行文艺方针所获的成绩，正如曾经由于强调学习民间而全盘否定西洋的偏向一样，在入城之后，忽视七年来改造秧歌、民歌、年画、鼓词的经验与成就，不适当的强调西洋技法。……这些，虽然不是普遍存在的，但不能不说是违反毛主席的文艺方针的极其有害的倾向。对于这些群众观点与艺术观点还不健全或者还不巩固的同志，你能说他对于方针学习得太多了吗？
    要是我们把文艺干部的范围扩大来看，则问题更形严重。从一月八日山西日报刊载的王大斌同志“我对于太原市卖旧年画书局的意见”看来，存在于旧艺人中的问题很不简单。根据该文的统计，仅仅出现在太原市上的有毒的年画就有六十七种。请看看“最新二十四孝图”、“天赐财源”、“济公活佛济世图”、“魁星点状元”、“上海摩登女郎”、“对影自怜”、“兰汤浴罢”、“春色恼人”，这些腐臭的名目，你就可以想见其内容腐朽到什么程度，这也可证明大量的民间艺人的文艺思想里，除了封建的殖民地的色情的小市民趣味，只管销售，对宣传教育不负责任的动机以外，还有什么东西？如果再看上海出版的新连环图画，同样可以证明他们需要学习之迫切，虽有好些内容形式都不错的，但是也还有许多没有摆脱应该摆脱的旧传统旧作风，以神怪趣味来反迷信的色彩。就在旧戏改良上，虽然有很多成绩，但大部分还在旧戏的圈套里；即令演着新戏，也还有迎合小市民趣味不顾严肃内容，卖弄着个人色相，习惯的来一些不必要的噱头，因而损害主题的效果。由此可见：旧艺人迫切需要改造。担任改造工作的干部的数量需要很大，而这些干部不首先学通方针是不能很好完成任务的。
    七年来文艺界的情况是变了，但并没有因为大量文艺工作者的进步而减轻了学习“文艺座谈会讲话”的作用；相反的，由于斗争的更形复杂，战线的扩大，这不受时间限制的文件更显得重要。是的，加紧学习文艺方针在一定时期要影响创作的数量，但因此妨碍了某种非人民大众之立场的创作，这种妨碍是必要的有益的。是的，方针的学习不能停止在文件的阅读，如果止于背诵文件，或者念经似的重复着“为人民服务”的口号而不联系实际问题，文件的精神也学不懂，更不能希望发挥它。但是，如果以为“文艺座谈会讲话”已经过时，轻视它的无比的指导作用，或者满足于这方针之一知半解而不从各方面研究这方针，不仅会在飞跃前进的现实之前失却作家的作用，就个人说，也有被现实抛弃的危险，至少是掉队的危险。整个文艺界和革命形势的发展一样，在无产阶级先锋队的文艺政策指导之下将飞跃的发展，但如果个人不努力，最不幸的是自己。“干”是必要的，但学习文艺方针也就是“干”的主要环节；只要不是学究式的或教条主义的学习，它将帮助你“干”得更有勇气也更有效果。
