　　Rushing to Produce New Uniforms for the People's Liberation Army
    Beijing Clothing Factory Summer Clothing Production
    Exceeds Standard Quota
    [This newspaper's report] The Beijing Clothing Factory, under the Logistics Department of the North China Military Region, has exceeded its standard quota for summer clothing production. In the second half of January, the average daily output per person in the entire factory was 6.636 sets, exceeding the original standard (6.5 sets) by slightly less than 2.1%. This was nearly 17% higher than the average output in the first half of the month (5.6756 sets). Because workers are now relatively skilled in sewing new-style summer uniforms, the quality generally meets standards. Taking the First Branch Factory as an example: When production began in early December of last year, almost half of the products did not meet requirements. In January, only about 10% had minor defects.
    Because the summer uniforms are a newly designed style, workers were not proficient when production began, and the production performance in December of last year was very low. At that time, the factory leadership, in consideration of this practical situation, requested approval from higher authorities to calculate wages based on a "waiting for materials" basis, issuing half a month's salary. At the same time, workers worked overtime to master the techniques. Many workers arrived at the factory as early as 6:00 AM, completing various preparatory tasks before the start of work (7:30 AM). Workers at the First Branch Factory voluntarily decided to start work half an hour early. Many people at the Second Branch Factory did not rest at noon. After discussion by all the workers, it was felt that this would affect the workers' health, and a resolution was made: uniformly work overtime, with the time not to exceed one hour. As a result of everyone's hard work and intense efforts, they quickly mastered the techniques, and many models who exceeded their targets emerged. Worker Diao Jincai achieved an average daily record of 12.8 sets in the second half of January. Others such as Wang Hongji and Yao Dianzhong also produced more than 11 sets each. According to statistics for the second half of January, the number of people exceeding the standard output in the First Branch Factory reached 64.71% of the entire factory's workers, and 75.38% in the Second Branch Factory. Starting in February, the First and Second Branch Factories launched a revolutionary competition, and everyone has full confidence in completing the task and ensuring that the troops will wear the new-style summer uniforms on time.

　　为解放军赶制新装
    京被服厂夏服生产
    超过标准定额
    【本报讯】华北军区军需部所属北京被服厂的夏服生产已超过标准定额。一月份下半月全厂平均每人每天产量为六·六三六套，超过原定标准（六·五套）的百分之二·一弱。比上半月的平均产量（五·六七五六套）提高了百分之一七弱。由于工人对新式夏服的缝制已比较熟练，在质量上一般都能符合标准。以一分厂说：去年十二月初做时，几乎有一半不合要求。而一月份只有百分之十左右有些小毛病。
    因夏服是新定式样，初做时工人不熟练，去年十二月份生产成绩很低。当时工厂领导上为照顾此种实际情况，曾呈请上级按停工待料计算，发半月工资。同时，工人则加班生产，努力掌握技术。有很多工友，每天早六时就进厂，在开工（七时半）前完成各种准备工作。一分厂工人曾自动决议提前开工半点钟。二分厂有很多人中午不休息。后经全体工人讨论，觉得这样会影响工人健康，乃做出决议：统一加班，时间不得超过一小时。由于大家努力学习，紧张工作的结果，很快的掌握了技术，并出现了很多超过任务的模范。工人刁金才一月份下半月达到平均每天十二·八套的纪录。其他如王鸿吉、姚殿中等亦均在十一套以上。一月份下半月统计，一分厂超过标准产量的人数达该分厂全体工人的百分之六四·七一，二分厂百分之七五·三八。从二月份起，一分厂和二分厂又发起革命竞赛，大家有充分信心完成任务，保证让部队按时穿上新式的夏服。
