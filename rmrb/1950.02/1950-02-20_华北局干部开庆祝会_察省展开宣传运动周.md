Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 17th: The people of North China are welcoming the great news that coincided with the New Year, the signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance and other agreements, with extraordinary excitement. When the Central People's Broadcasting Station first broadcast this good news on the morning of the 15th, personnel from all departments and units under the North China Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and the North China Military Region of the People's Liberation Army crowded around the radios to listen carefully and held small celebration seminars. On the afternoon of the 16th, the North China Bureau convened a celebration meeting of all cadres of the first-level organs of North China, where Nie Rongzhen spoke. He called on everyone to study the published documents carefully and use them as weapons to expose all the rumors and deceptions of imperialists and warmongers.

    Baoding
    Baoding, the capital of Hebei Province, held a grand celebration attended by 12,000 people on the afternoon of the 15th. When the news reached various towns and villages, workers, farmers, and students expressed their joy and gratitude. Wang Changjiu, a worker on the Beijing-Hankou Railway, said with emotion: We must produce well and make China prosperous and strong soon to repay the assistance of the Soviet elder brother. Five thousand farmers from Nan, Bei Da Ran, and Bei Shi Ge Zhuang villages in Qingyuan County gathered at Zhong Ran Village at 7:00 p.m. on the same day to celebrate. Mi Zhiwen, a Hui Muslim, said happily: The friendship of the Soviet Union towards us is as high as the sky and as deep as the earth. We must always unite and get along well with the Soviet Union. After hearing the news, Song Luoxue, a labor hero from Songjia Village in Mancheng County, immediately invited sixteen people from the village to hold a discussion. Song Luoxue said: I visited the Tianjin Industrial Exhibition and heard the Soviet agricultural experts speak. I know that the Soviet Union uses machines for farming, which is much better than our farming methods. We must learn from them since we are friends with such a country.

    Taiyuan
    When the news reached Taiyuan City, Shanxi Province, national flags were hung all over the streets and alleys, and people sang: "On this joyous day, our national flag should fly at the highest point." Young students twisted the Yangko dance to their hearts' content in the snow. People from all walks of life expressed their feelings. Hao Cheng, a steelworker, said excitedly: In the past, China signed many treaties with foreign countries, but this is the first time we have seen such an equal and mutually beneficial one. This makes me realize that only the Soviet Union can show such justice and selflessness. At 1:30 p.m. on the 15th, more than 3,000 cadres from various organs, groups, and schools held a celebration meeting. People beat gongs and drums, twisted the Yangko, and walked towards the venue.

Shu Zhaoji, a worker from the Zhangjiakou Machine Factory, said at the meeting: We have a clearer understanding of who is the enemy and who is the friend. Soviet loans help us build industry, and we must learn from the Soviet experience to build China's industry well. That evening, more than 1,000 representatives from all walks of life held a celebration meeting and sent a telegram to pay their respects to Marshal Stalin and Chairman Mao.
