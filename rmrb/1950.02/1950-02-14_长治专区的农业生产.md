A Basic Summary of Agricultural Production in 1949

After the start of spring last year, disasters continued, and the year's production, through struggle against various disasters, achieved a harvest of six and a half tenths for the entire district. Xiangyuan County increased grain production by more than 60,000 *shi*. A survey of 21 villages in Wuxiang showed an average increase of 2.2 *dou* per *mu* compared to the previous three years, with an estimated increase of over 99,700 *shi* of grain for the county. Changzhi County is estimated to have increased production by over 62,000 *shi*. The basic experiences behind these achievements are:

First, land reform throughout the district was completed, feudalism was eliminated, and class relations underwent fundamental changes. Farmers labored freely and happily on their own land, making last year's production markedly different from that of previous years.

Second, after party consolidation, not only were party-masses relations closer than before, but in particular, the leadership capacity of rural branches was greatly improved. The leading role of rural party members in production surpassed that of any previous year. At the same time, branch leaders basically learned how to solve the specific difficulties of the masses in production and how to resolve ideological obstacles among the masses. Cadres established a good work style.

Third, technical leadership was emphasized for the first time in leading production last year. In many areas, fertilization reached pre-war levels. In terms of intensive farming, there was also great progress under difficult labor and animal power conditions. Taking plowing as an example, according to a survey of eight villages, those who plowed once accounted for 29.4% of the cultivated land area before the war, compared to 25% last year. Those who plowed twice accounted for 51% before the war and remained at 51% last year. Those who plowed three or more times accounted for 19.8% before the war and 24% last year. Water conservancy construction also became a mass demand. One hundred and fifty-five villages in seven counties dug 557 wells, and 411 villages repaired old wells, totaling 2,050. Twenty-two villages in five counties repaired 60 canals, which can irrigate 1,674 *mu* of land. Eighty-eight villages in three counties opened canals to irrigate 7,383 *mu* of land. Thirty-three villages in four counties newly built 18 drainage ditches, which can turn 8,127 *mu* of waterlogged land into fertile fields. Last autumn, the masses also carried out seed selection. According to statistics from six counties, 107,474 *shi* were selected on the threshing grounds and in the fields (of which field selection accounted for 84%), which alone is enough for all the land in the district to use.

Fourth, organizing for production has become a habit of the masses. In the old liberated area of Pingshun, those who are organized account for an average of 85% of the total number of households and 87% of the labor force. Those who have organized livestock account for 89%. In Changzhi, those who are organized account for 48% of the total number of households and 50% of the labor force.

Fifth, women play a significant role in production. According to a survey of eleven villages, women laborers and semi-laborers who regularly participate in agricultural labor account for 46.8% of the total number of women. Those who participate in seasonal agricultural labor account for 40.9% of the total number of women. Women laborers who are organized account for 41% of the female labor force.

Estimate for Striving to Achieve Pre-War Levels of Agricultural Production in 1950

To further improve agricultural production and strive to reach or exceed pre-war levels is the overall task and goal of this district's agricultural production this year. According to a survey of eleven villages, achieving this goal is entirely possible. Last year, eight of these eleven villages had already exceeded pre-war levels. Among them, Yaoshanggou in Wuxiang exceeded pre-war levels by 1%. Houjianao in Wuxiang, Nanjie in Pingcheng, Lingchuan, Beishe in Licheng, and Qiaogou all exceeded pre-war levels by 22% to 25%. Maicang in Licheng, Hanhong in Qinyuan, and Yaogou in Lingchuan also exceeded pre-war levels by 5% to 15%. The remaining three villages of the eleven were still below pre-war levels. The production foundation of the above eleven villages is at a general level. If these general villages could achieve such results in 1949, then this year, as long as we work hard, it is entirely possible to strive for the vast majority of villages to reach pre-war levels and for some villages to exceed pre-war levels. But this requires:

1.  Thoroughly completing land reform and party consolidation work to prepare a better prerequisite for this year's production. 2. Strengthening production planning so that this year's agricultural production can be carried out in a planned and guided manner. 3. Strengthening technical leadership. The heroes who returned from visiting the Tianjin Industrial Exhibition all have confidence in improving technology and improving agricultural implements. The masses universally demand solutions to technical problems. 4. Vigorously developing water conservancy is one of the main links in this year's large-scale production. Currently, the masses in various counties are actively opening canals, digging wells, and installing waterwheels, reflecting the suffering of cadres and the masses from years of drought. The government should vigorously support this. 5. Transforming and establishing cooperatives. Experience has shown that purely making a profit is not what the masses demand. What the masses demand is how to support production, how to find sales channels for rural products, and how to exchange for necessary living materials. Therefore, transforming and establishing cooperatives has become an important part of this year's production work.

　　长治专区的农业生产
    一九四九年农业生产的基本总结
    去年入春以后灾害赓续，全年生产在向各种灾害斗争中，取得了全区六成半的收成。襄垣县增产粮食六万余石。武乡二十一村调查平均每亩比前三年增产二斗二升，估计该县增产粮食九万九千七百余石。长治县估计增产六万二千余石。取得以上成绩的基本经验为：
    第一、全区土改结束，封建消灭，阶级关系起了根本变化，农民在自己的土地上自由而愉快的劳动，使去年生产与往年的生产明显地表现了不同。
    第二、经过整党，不仅是党群关系较前密切了，特别是农村支部的领导能力有极大的提高。农村党员在生产中的带头作用，超过了以往任何一年，同时支部领导基本上学会了如何解决群众生产中的具体困难，学会了如何解决群众思想阻碍。干部树立起了优良作风。
    第三、去年在领导生产中。第一次重视了技术领导。上肥不少地区达到战前水平。精耕细作方面，在困难的劳畜力条件下也有很大进步。以犁地为例，据八个村的调查，战前犁一遍者，占耕地面积百分之二九点四，去年则占耕地面积百分之二五。犁两遍者战前为百分之五一，去年仍是百分之五一。犁三遍以上者战前为百分之十九点八，去年为百分之二四。兴修水利也成为群众性的要求。七个县一百五十五个村打井五百五十七眼，修旧井的有四百一十一个村共修有二千零五十眼。五个县二十二村修渠六十道，可浇地一千六百七十四亩。三个县八十八个村，开渠灌地七千三百八十三亩。四个县三十三个村新修排水渠共十八道，能把八千一百二十七亩涝地变为良田。去秋群众并进行了选种工作。据六个县统计，场上与田间选种达十万七千四百七十四石（其中田间选种占百分之八四），仅此数即可够全区所有土地使用。
    第四、组织起来进行生产已成为群众之习惯。老区之平顺组织起来者平均占总户数百分之八五，占劳力百分之八七。牲口组织起来者占百分之八九。长治组织起来的占总户数百分之四八，占劳力百分之五○。
    第五、妇女在生产中起很大作用。据十一个村的调查，妇女劳力半劳力常年参加农业劳动者占妇女总数百分之四六点八。参加季节性的农业劳动者占妇女总数百分之四○点九。妇女劳力组织起来者占妇女劳力百分之四一。
    一九五○年争取农业生产达到战前水平的估计
    将农业生产提高一步，争取达到战前或超过战前水平，是本区今年农业生产的总任务与目标。根据十一个村的调查，达到这一目标是完全可能的。这十一个村，去年已有八个村超过了战前水平。其中武乡窑上沟超出了战前水平百分之一。武乡侯家垴、陵川平城南街、黎城北社、桥沟均超过战前水平百分之二二至二五。黎城之麦苍、沁源之韩洪、陵川之窑沟亦均超出战前水平百分之五到一五。十一个村的其余三个村比战前水平尚低。以上十一村的生产基础均为一般水平。这类一般村一九四九年即能达到如此成果，则今年只要我们努力，争取绝大部分村庄达到战前水平，一部分村庄超过战前水平，是完全可能的。但这就需要：
    １、彻底完成土地改革与整党工作，给今年生产准备一个更好的前提条件。２、加强生产计划性，使今年农业生产有计划有领导地开展起来。３、加强技术领导。去天津参观工业展览回来的英雄们，一致都有提高技术与改良农具的信心。群众普遍要求解决技术问题。４、大力发展水利为今年大生产中的主要环节之一。现在各县群众积极的开渠、打井、按装水车，反映了干部群众几年来饱尝旱灾的痛苦，政府应大力扶持。５、改造与建立合作社。经验证明单纯营利并不是群众要求。群众所要求的是如何扶植生产，如何为农村生产品找到销路，如何换回生活必需的资料。因此改造与建立合作社，成为今年生产工作中的重要一环。
