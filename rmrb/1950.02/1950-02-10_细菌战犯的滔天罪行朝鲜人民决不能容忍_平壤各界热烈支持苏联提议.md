　　Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 9th. People from all walks of life in Korea warmly support the Soviet government's proposal to establish an international special military tribunal to try Japanese bacterial warfare criminals such as Hirohito. Jeong Keo-won, vice chairman of the General Federation of Trade Unions, said: "The Soviet government, in order to consolidate world peace and security, not only opposes bacterial weapons, but is also fighting to ban the use and manufacture of atomic weapons. The working class of North Korea, standing at the forefront of the struggle for the peaceful reunification of the motherland, firmly supports the Soviet government's proposal and advocates severely punishing Japanese war criminals." Jeong Seong-yeon, vice chairman of the Central Committee of the North Korean Democratic Party, said: "The trial of Japanese bacterial warfare criminals by the Soviet Primorsky Krai Military Tribunal last December proved that this group of murderers not only prepared, but also used bacterial weapons against the Chinese people, and used the lives of thousands of people as experiments. This inhuman and heinous crime is hated by the people of the world and cannot be tolerated by the Korean people. Therefore, we believe that the Soviet government's proposal is in line with justice."
　　Kim Dal-hyun, Chairman of the Central Committee of the Cheondoist Chongu Party, said: "Japanese imperialism is the irreconcilable enemy of our Korean people. We especially support the Soviet government's proposal and firmly advocate exposing and smashing the US imperialist plot to protect Japanese war criminals."
　　Park Jeong-ae, Chairman of the North Korean Women's Alliance, Hyun Jeong-min, Chairman of the Democratic Youth League, Kang Jeong-gan, Chairman of the Farmers' Alliance, and others, also unanimously stated that they fully agree with the Soviet government's proposal and advocate severely punishing Japanese bacterial war criminals such as Hirohito.

　　细菌战犯的滔天罪行朝鲜人民决不能容忍
    平壤各界热烈支持苏联提议
    【新华社平壤九日电】朝鲜各界人民热烈支持苏联政府关于成立国际特别军事法庭以审讯日本细菌战争罪犯裕仁等的提议。职业总同盟副委员长郑可元说：“苏联政府为巩固世界和平安全，不仅反对细菌武器，并且还正为禁止使用和制造原子武器而斗争。站在祖国和平统一斗争最前列的北朝鲜工人阶级，坚决支持苏联政府的提议，主张严惩日本战犯。”北朝鲜民主党中央委员会副委员长郑圣彦说：“去年十二月苏联滨海军区军事法庭对日本细菌战犯的审讯，证明这群杀人犯，不仅在准备、而且已经对中国人民使用过细菌武器，并曾以几千人的生命作为试验。这种惨无人道的滔天罪行，为全世界人民所切齿痛恨，亦为我朝鲜人民所不能容忍。因此，我们认为苏联政府的提议，是合乎正义的。”
    青友党中央委员会委员长金达铉说：“日本帝国主义是我们朝鲜人民不共戴天的仇敌，我们特别支持苏联政府的提议，坚决主张揭露和粉碎美帝国主义企图庇护日本战犯的阴谋。”
    北朝鲜妇女同盟委员长朴正爱，民主青年同盟委员长玄正民，农民同盟委员长姜正干等，也一致表示，完全赞同苏联政府的提议，主张严惩裕仁等日本细菌战犯。
