Winter School in Facun Village, Longjiang County
　　Xu Xing

　　In Facun Village, Longjiang County, Heilongjiang Province, Northeast China, as the autumn harvest was nearing its end last year, the young people started clamoring: "Let's have winter school after the harvest!"

　　Facun Village has about 200 households. The winter school in the village the year before last was quite good. Out of the entire village population of 1,042 people, more than 250 young men and women attended winter school. This year's winter school is even more energetic: Since the start of the school on November 20th last year, the village cooperative sold more than 600 sheets of newsprint, more than 20 notebooks, more than 150 pencils, and more than 100 bottles of blue ink in less than 20 days. Most of the young men and women in the village carry a small notebook with them, studying and writing at any time. Some students who received books were so happy that they tucked them away on their bodies, saying, "I'm not afraid this year, I have a book this time. I'll make sure the book stays with me and I stay with the book, let's see if it will run away!" The teachers are also very enthusiastic, still teaching words on the road with the students after class. The students said, "If we still can't learn well, there's really no excuse." This year, more people in the village are attending winter school than the year before last. There are a total of 261 students in six winter schools, an average of more than one person per family. Among them, 184 are men and 77 are women. The vast majority are young people, accounting for 46.8 percent of the young people in the village.

　　In winter school, the textbooks used are the Winter School Political Textbook, the Literacy Textbook, the Party Member Textbook, and materials from newspapers. The central work of the village is also combined with study and discussion in winter school. Through learning in winter school, the political awareness of the farmers has been raised, and they have become more active in production. For example, Wang Defu did not understand the production policy in the past, fearing "eating from the big pot," and was unwilling to work. After studying in winter school, he became particularly active in production, buying a mule and a horse, earning more than 10 million yuan (Northeast currency) from cutting reeds, and buying two sows, preparing to expand sideline production. After the winter school started in Facun Village, one of the five natural villages, 27 production teams were organized, more than ten more than the year before last. There are no more "loafers" in the entire Facun Village. Because they often examine themselves in winter school, there are fewer quarrels in the family and fewer "witty remarks." During the New Year's Day, young men and women sang songs, danced the Yangko, and held entertainment parties, replacing the past "welcoming the God of Wealth." Two couples who got married changed the ritual of worshiping heaven and earth to paying respect to the portrait of Chairman Mao, no longer worshiping the "God of Heaven and Earth." The cultural level of the farmers has also been improved. Students who did not know a single word originally have learned to recognize about 150 words, and some can write meeting notices, learn to write passes, and keep work records. Yang Jinghai, a village cadre who did not know a single word in the past, can now take notes on a small notebook during meetings.

　　Why can the winter school in Facun Village be established and run relatively well? There are several reasons for this:

　　(1) The emancipated farmers urgently demand culture

　　Through land reform and two years of great production movement, the masses of Facun Village have been completely emancipated politically and economically. The lives of the people in the whole village have gradually risen. Last winter, everyone changed into new cotton-padded coats. Every family had enough grain to eat for the coming year. Political and economic emancipation has made farmers urgently demand culture. Cadres and party members feel that not knowing how to read is not good for leading the work. Armed committee member Yang Jinghai said: "It's not good not knowing how to read! I can't remember what the superiors say." The general public feels that it is really inconvenient not knowing how to read, and it is difficult to keep accounts and spend money. A person who had just risen from a farmhand to a middle peasant said: "In the past, I only worked for others, and I didn't even have a quilt. There was no way to learn how to read. Now I have both a car and a horse, and I have more dealings with others. I take out handfuls of tickets when I go to the market. It's really awkward not knowing a single word." This vividly illustrates the urgent need of the masses for cultural knowledge. They want to learn to read, to calculate, to keep accounts, and to know about important national events. This is one of the basic reasons why winter school in Facun Village can create a upsurge.

　　(2) Village cadres enthusiastically lead, and party and league members take the lead in guaranteeing

　　When the winter school started in December last year, the Communist Party branch in Facun Village called on party members to lead the winter school well. The branch decided that when evaluating the work of party members and cadres, winter school work would account for 15 points. When the village branch of the Communist Youth League arranged work, it also called on each league member to take the lead in attending winter school, and to ensure that each person brings two to three masses to winter school. When the Village Winter School Committee was established, it was emphasized that cadres and party members should recognize at least 150 words in this year's winter school. And it was decided that when the final examination of winter school results, the cadres and party members should be tested first. In this way, cadres and party and league members played an active leading and promoting role in winter school. Armed committee member Yang Jinghai ran for seven consecutive nights as early as when the winter school was first organized the year before last, persuading and mobilizing everyone to attend winter school. If the winter school didn't have a blackboard, he would find a blackboard. If the winter school room wasn't clean, he would sweep the floor and clean the stove. Village cadre Lao Aotou helped turn on the lights and start the stove every day before the students arrived. The Jiangjiajie Village winter school didn't have a house, so village cadre Wang Guitian vacated his house for the winter school to attend classes. The village's labor models also enthusiastically helped promote the winter school movement. For example, labor model Granny Zhang has a high prestige among women. Some women were not sure about attending winter school, so she explained the women attending night school in the county town to help them understand. Sometimes, when it snowed and many women were absent, she would greet them. The hard work and enthusiasm of the cadres and labor models in running the winter school influenced and moved the masses, and increased everyone's enthusiasm for attending winter school.

　　(3) Implement the mass line, and practice teaching each other among the people

　　The winter school in Facun Village has implemented the working method of the mass line from mobilizing the masses to enroll to teaching. When mobilizing the masses to attend winter school, various methods were adopted, such as persuading students, revealing ignorance, telling cultural sufferings, and organizing elementary school students to perform propaganda plays, so that the masses could understand the benefits of attending winter school. Family members were also mobilized to persuade family members. For example, Lao Tongtou persuaded his son and daughter-in-law to attend winter school, saying, "It's only two hours a day, you can squeeze out time if you work a little harder." The village also relies on the masses' conscious and voluntary efforts to solve the winter school funding problem. In terms of teaching, if there are not enough teachers, the method of "teaching each other among the people" is adopted, and people with some culture are elected from the masses in the village to teach. This year, there are sixteen teachers in the winter school in the whole village, eight of whom are from the masses, and two are village elementary school teachers. Because the teachers are selected from the masses, the relationship between teachers and students is very harmonious, and it is very convenient to ask questions about words. Under the leadership of the Winter School Committee, the elementary school teachers play a backbone role, holding a meeting every seven days to specifically study the courses to be taught next time and exchange teaching experiences and methods. Therefore, the teachers' teaching can be continuously improved and improved.

　　(4) Rely on the masses' consciousness to establish a system of discipline

　　In order to consolidate and persist in winter school, a certain system and discipline were established on the basis of the masses' conscious voluntariness. The system is to divide classes according to the level of knowledge, and hold a self-criticism meeting every week to examine all aspects of life and study. Family life problems can also be discussed at the meeting. The discipline of winter school is compiled into a few jingles as everyone's learning covenant:

　　Attend winter school every day, learn to read and open your mind.
　　Don't be late for class, study hard.
　　Not only can you do it yourself, but you also have to teach others.
　　Ask for leave if you have something to do, and the teacher will approve it.
　　Don't make noise when listening to lectures, sit firmly in your seat.
　　Don't smoke in class, so as not to smoke others.
　　Sweep the room clean, and be careful with the stove fire.
　　Arrange the tables and chairs neatly, and take care of public property.
　　Everyone has made this covenant, and it is most important to abide by it.

　　This covenant was made by everyone consciously, without any coercion, so everyone can easily implement it.

　　龙江县发达村的冬学
　　许行
    东北黑龙江省龙江县发达村，当去年秋收打场将要结束的时候，青年们就嚷嚷开了：“打完场办冬学呵！”
    发达村有二百来户人家。该村前年的冬学就办得挺不坏。全村一千零四十二人，其中青壮年男女共有二百五十多人上冬学。今年的冬学办得更起劲：从去年十一月二十日开学，不到二十天工夫，村合作社就卖出白报纸六百多张，笔记本二十多本，铅笔一百五十余支，蓝墨水一百多瓶。村里的青壮年男女，大多数身上都揣着个小本本，随时学，随时写。有的学员得到了书，就高兴得往身上揣，都说：“今年不怕啦，这回有书啦，我叫它书不离身，身不离书，看它会不会！”教师也挺起劲，下了课和同学走在道上还教字，学员们说：“这再学不好，简直没话说了。”今年全村上冬学的人，也比前年多了。六处冬学，学员一共二百六十一人，平均一家有一个人还多。这中间男子一百八十四人，妇女七十七人。绝大部分是青壮年，他们占全村青壮年百分之四十六点八。
    冬学里面，用冬学政治课本、识字课本、党员课本和报纸上的材料作教材。村中的中心工作也结合在冬学里学习讨论。在冬学的学习中，农民们政治觉悟提高了，对生产都积极起来了。如王德富过去不了解生产政策，怕“吃大堆”，不愿干活，经过冬学学习后，生产特别起劲，买了一匹骡子和一匹马，割苇子赚了一千多万元（东北币），又买了两个老母猪，准备扩大副业生产。五个自然屯之一的发达屯，冬学开始以后，组织起了二十七个生产小组，比前年多了十来个。全发达村已没有了“二流子”。因为在冬学里常检讨，家庭里吵嘴的和说“俏皮话”的也少见了。过新历年时青年男女唱歌、扭秧歌、开娱乐晚会，代替了过去的“接财神”。有两家结婚的，把拜天地改成了向毛主席的挂像致敬，不再拜“天地爷”了。农民的文化程度也提高了，原来一字不识的学员，已认识了一百五十来个字，有的已能写开会的通知，学会开路条和记工账。过去一字不识的村干部杨景海，现在开会时也能往小本本上记一记了。
    发达村的冬学，为什么能搞起来又搞得比较好呢？这有下面几个原因：
    （一）翻了身的农民迫切要求文化
    经过土地改革和两年的大生产运动，发达村的群众，在政治上和经济上是完全翻身了。全村人民的生活，已逐步上升。去年冬天每人都换了新棉袄。每家都有了足够来年吃的粮食。政治上和经济上的翻身，使农民对文化有了迫切的要求。干部、党员觉得不识字不好领导工作，武装委员杨景海说：“不识字算不行呵！上边说点事也记不住。”一般群众觉得不识字真不方便，记账花钱都有困难。一个才从雇农上升为中农的群众说：“过去净给人家干活，连床被子也没有，想识字也没办法；现在又是车又是马，和人家来往也多了，上街赶集票子也是一把一把的往外拿，一个大字不识真蹩拗”。这很生动地说明了群众对文化知识的迫切需要。他们要求识字、要求会打算盘、会记账，要求知道国家大事。这是发达村冬学能够造成热潮的基本原因之一。
    （二）村干热心领导，党、团员带头保证
    去年十二月份开始办冬学时，发达村中共党支部就号召党员要好好领导办冬学。支部决定党员干部工作评分时，冬学工作占十五分。青年团村支部布置工作时，也号召每个团员要带头上冬学，并且要保证每个人带两个到三个群众上冬学。在村冬学委员会成立时，曾强调干部和党员在今年冬学中起码要认识一百五十个字。并决定最后检查冬学成绩时，首先要测验干部和党员。这样一来，干部和党、团员对冬学起了积极领导和带头推动的作用。武装委员杨景海，早在前年刚组织冬学时，他就连续跑了七个晚上，劝说动员大家上冬学，冬学没黑板给找黑板，冬学屋子不干净就给扫地掏炉子。村干部老敖头，每天学员们还未到，他就去帮助点灯、生炉子。姜家街屯冬学没房子，村干部王桂田就腾出自己的房子给冬学上学。村里的劳动模范，也热心帮助推动冬学运动。如劳模张老太太，在妇女中很有威信，有些妇女对上冬学不摸底，她就给讲解县城里妇女上夜校的事让她们了解。有时，遇上雪天，妇女缺课的多了，她就去打招呼。干部和劳动模范这样艰苦热心办冬学的行动，影响和感动了群众，提高了大家上冬学的劲头。
    （三）贯彻群众路线，实行以民教民
    发达村的冬学，从动员群众入学到教学，都贯彻了群众路线的工作方法。动员群众上冬学时，采取了劝学、挖糊涂、文化诉苦、组织小学生演宣传剧等多种多样的方式，使群众认识上冬学的好处。又发动亲人劝亲人。如老佟头劝儿子媳妇上冬学，他说：“一天才两个钟头，那里紧一紧就挤出时间来了。”村上解决冬学经费问题，也依靠群众的自觉自愿。在教学上，教员不够，就采取“以民教民”的办法，从本村群众中选举有些文化的人来教。今年冬学全村十六个教员，其中八个是群众，两个是村小学教员。因为教员是群众里选出来的，师生的关系非常融洽，问字也很方便。教员们在冬委会的领导下，小学教员起着骨干作用，每七天开一次碰头会，专门研究下次要教的课程和交换教学经验和方法。因此，教员的教学能不断改进和提高。
    （四）依靠群众自觉，建立制度纪律
    为了使冬学能巩固和坚持下去，在群众自觉自愿的基础上，订了一定的制度和纪律。制度是按程度编班，每星期开一次检讨会，检讨生活、学习各方面的问题，家庭生活问题也可在会上讨论。冬学的纪律编成了几句顺口溜，作为大家的学习公约：
    天天上冬学，识字开脑筋。
    上课不晚来，学习要用心。
    不但自己会，还要教别人。
    有事先请假，老师来批准。
    听讲不吵吵，坐位要坐稳。
    上课不抽烟，免得熏别人。
    屋子扫干净，炉火加小心。
    桌凳摆整齐，爱护公物品。
    公约大家订，遵守最要紧。
    这个公约都是大家自觉订起来的，毫不勉强，因此大家很容易执行。
