　　Beijing Municipal Government Facilitates Taxpayers by Creating Grain-Based Tax Payment Certificates

    [Beijing News] The Beijing Municipal People's Government has recently created grain-based tax payment certificates to facilitate taxpayers. The People's Bank of China, Beijing Branch, and its subordinate branches have been entrusted to handle these certificates, which will be available for purchase starting February 13th. The tax payment certificates are denominated in units of "jin" (catty) of millet, with denominations of 20 jin, 50 jin, and 100 jin. Taxpayers can purchase these certificates freely at any time, with the millet price calculated based on the treasury's millet purchase price on the day of purchase. When the tax bureau collects taxes (mainly seasonal industrial and commercial tax, property tax, land tax, vehicle license tax, hawker license tax, etc.), taxpayers can use the certificates to offset the amount of tax owed to the relevant tax collection authority. This will enable taxpayers to pre-pay taxes in a planned manner, overcoming the difficulty of raising funds for concentrated payment. However, to prevent the certificates from circulating on the market and to prevent counterfeiting, it is stipulated that the certificates are registered, do not accrue interest, cannot be discounted, and must not be circulated on the market. Anyone who forges the certificates or engages in activities that damage the certificates will be prosecuted as if they had forged securities.

　　京市府便利纳税人
    制定预缴税款折米券
    【北京讯】北京市人民政府顷制定预缴税款折米券，委托中国人民银行北京分行及其所属分支机构代为办理，自本月十三日起开始发售。该预缴税款折米券以小米斤为计算单位，券额分为二十斤、五十斤、一百斤三种。各纳税义务人可随时自由购买，米价按购买当日金库入库米价折算。税务局征收税款时（主要是季节性的工商业税、房产税、地产税、使用牌照税、摊贩牌照税等），可持券向主管征收机关抵交应纳税款。这样可使纳税义务人有计划的预缴税款，以克服集中缴纳筹措之困难。但为避免该券在市面流通并防止伪造起见，并规定该券为记名式，不计利息，不贴现，不得流通市面。如有伪造该券或有损害该券行为者，则依伪造有价证券论处。
