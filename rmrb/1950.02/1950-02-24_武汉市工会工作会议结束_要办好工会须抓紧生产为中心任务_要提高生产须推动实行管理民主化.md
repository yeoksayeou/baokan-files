(Xinhua News Agency, Hankou, 21st) The Wuhan Second Trade Union Work Conference, which opened on the 7th, concluded on the 11th. More than 200 people attended, including cadres from trade unions in railway, postal, telecommunications, military supplies, seafarers, textile, dock, and shop employee systems, as well as representatives from various agencies. The conference focused on production issues, reporting and summarizing the work of the trade unions over the past three months, and arranging the work tasks for the first half of 1950. Many examples in the conference reports illustrate that trade unions that can focus on production as their central task can carry out their work smoothly and achieve results. For example, the trade union of the Hubei Provincial Agricultural Reclamation Department, by focusing on production work, taking the initiative to understand the situation, helping the administrative side to formulate production plans, mobilizing workers to discuss the plans, and launching production campaigns, improved its relationship with the administrative side and enhanced the workers' production enthusiasm. The reported examples also prove that if trade unions actively promote the implementation of democratic management in public factories, they can improve production. For example, the Wuhan Repair Armament Factory, due to convening a factory-wide employee representative meeting, and all work resolutions being discussed by the trade union and workers, the workers actively thought of ways to improve work. Workers in the gun repair shop increased their daily gun repair output from seven or eight guns to more than twenty. The gun barrel repair shop even created a new method of cleaning gun barrels, increasing efficiency by fifty times. The reports also showed that there were serious shortcomings in the past work of trade unions, such as cadres not paying attention to studying policies and learning about production. For example, in the cloth industry, at the beginning of signing the labor-capital collective contract, because trade union cadres did not dare to boldly adhere to policies, that is to say, they could not persuade workers to lower excessively high wage demands with the long-term and highest interests of the workers, they took a detour. In terms of production, trade union cadres in general public factories only did verbal encouragement and appeals, but the concrete integration of trade union work with production, and the concrete organization of the vast number of workers to complete production tasks, was generally done very poorly. Therefore, the conference proposed that, in addition to continuing to develop trade union organizations and universally conclude labor-capital collective contracts, the general task for the first half of this year in public factories is to: "Continue to organize workers to restore and develop production, and ensure the victorious completion of the production tasks of various departments." First, the responsible persons of various industrial trade unions, factory branches, and trade union cadres must, if they lead a certain industry, be familiar with the production process and business situation of that industry. Oppose the style of not paying attention to production and not humbly learning from workers and technicians. In the future, the first condition for cultivating and promoting worker cadres is to see their attitude towards production. Secondly, in addition to universally establishing factory management committees and implementing democratic management, production contracts including quality, quantity, time, staffing, and reward and punishment regulations, etc., can be trial-ordered by industry or factory and workshop, under the principle of taking into account both public and private interests. In terms of cultural education and labor insurance welfare, it should also be closely coordinated with production, and workers and staff who actively produce should be praised at any time, and those who lag behind should be educated at any time. In addition, the meeting believed that workers' canteens, hospitals, cooperatives, children's schools, etc. should also be run well to protect the lives of workers.

　　武汉市工会工作会议结束
    要办好工会须抓紧生产为中心任务  要提高生产须推动实行管理民主化
    【新华社汉口二十一日电】武汉市第二届工会工作会议，自七日开幕已于十一日结束。到会者有铁路、邮政、电信、军需、海员、纺织、码头、店员等各系统工会、各工厂分会干部及各机关代表共二百余人。会议围绕着生产问题，汇报与总结了三个月来的工会工作，和布置了一九五零年上半年的工作任务。会议汇报的许多事例中说明。凡能够抓紧生产为其中心任务的工会，工作就能顺利进行并获得成绩。如湖北省农垦处工会，由于抓紧了生产工作，主动地了解情况，帮助行政方面拟订生产计划，发动工人讨论计划，开展生产运动，因而改善了与行政方面的关系，提高了工人的生产情绪。汇报的事例也证明，工会如果在公营工厂积极推动实行管理民主化，就能使生产提高。如武汉修械厂，由于召开了全厂职工代表会，工作决议都经过工会与工人讨论，工人们便积极想法改进工作。修枪间工人从一天修枪七、八支，提高到二十余支。修炮间更创造了擦洗炮筒的新方法，使效力提高了五十倍。汇报同时也说明，过去工会工作中存在着干部不重视学习政策、学习生产的严重缺点。如布匹业在签订劳资集体合同刚开始时，就因为工会干部不敢大胆地坚持政策，也就是说不能以工人的长远的最高利益，说服工人降低过高的工资要求，因而走了一段弯路。在生产方面，一般公营工厂的工会干部，只做到在口头上的鼓动与号召，但具体地把工会工作与生产结合起来，具体地组织广大工人完成生产任务，则一般地做得很差。因此，大会提出：除了继续发展工会组织，普遍订立劳资集体合同以外，在公营工厂，今年上半年的总任务是：“继续组织工人恢复与发展生产，保证各部门生产任务的胜利完成。”首先，各产业工会、各工厂分会负责人员和工会干部，要做到领导那一行，就熟悉那一行的生产过程与营业情况。反对不重视生产、不虚心向工人和技术人员学习的作风。以后培养提拔工人干部的第一个条件，即视其对生产的态度如何。其次除了普遍成立工厂管理委员会，实施管理民主化外，并可以在公私兼顾的原则下，按产业或工厂、车间，试订包括定质、定量、定时、定员与奖惩条例等的生产合同。在文化教育与劳保福利方面，亦应紧密地配合生产，对积极生产的工人和职员应随时进行表扬，对落后的则应随时进行教育。此外会议认为还要办好工人的食堂、医院、合作社、子弟学校等，以保障工人的生活。
