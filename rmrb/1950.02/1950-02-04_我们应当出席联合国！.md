　　We Should Attend the United Nations!
　　Zhang Xiruo
　　After the end of the First World War, the victorious countries, in order to maintain world peace, organized a so-called League of Nations. Unfortunately, this League of Nations was later manipulated and used by a few great powers, losing its original meaning. After the end of the Second World War, the victorious countries organized the United Nations. Today, unfortunately, several constituent members of this United Nations, several imperialist elements, are attempting to use the UN organization as a tool for oppressing small and weak nations and opposing socialist and new democratic countries. They welcome with open arms and take great pleasure in any country that can serve as their tool and lackey. Conversely, they feel extremely troubled, want to keep at a great distance, and deeply resent any country that opposes class oppression, opposes imperialist aggression, and truly serves the interests of the broad masses of the people. The ugly farce of retaining the Kuomintang delegation being staged at Success Lake today is indicative of this. This is a series of monkey shows with different tunes played on the same instrument as the US imperialists' support for Chiang Kai-shek's counter-revolutionary war in China over the past few years, the creation of the Rhee Syngman puppet government in Korea, the support for the fallen fascist elements in Japan, the opposition to the revolutionary war in Greece, the promotion of the Marshall Plan, the signing of the North Atlantic Treaty, the collusion with Tito, and the utilization of Franco.
　　The excuse used by the US imperialists and their lackeys to oppose the expulsion of the Chiang Ting-fu delegation is that this delegation is "legal." According to this illogical logic, a delegation, regardless of whether it actually has a country to represent or people it is supposed to represent, as long as it insists that it can represent, as long as the foreign government that wants to use it as a puppet is willing to let it represent, and as long as it was recognized by those who want to use it in the past, then it will always be "legal," even if the signboard of the so-called government it represents has been moved from Nanjing to Guangzhou, from Guangzhou to Chongqing, from Chongqing to Chengdu, from Chengdu to Taipei, and will eventually be moved from Taipei to Manila or Washington. This kind of rogue behavior by the imperialists, especially their盟主(leader) the US imperialists, is not enough to harm the dignity of the Chinese people, nor can it infringe upon the interests of the Chinese state for a long time; it only turns themselves into the most boring and vulgar joke in the world.
　　The original intention of the United Nations' creation and the purpose of its charter are to defend world peace, not to promote world war. We Chinese today, for ourselves and for humanity, also want peace and not war. Therefore, we support the United Nations, which aims to defend world peace, and we need to participate in the United Nations to support it. Participating in the United Nations is our right and our obligation. Anyone who infringes on this right and hinders this obligation is our enemy. Our Central People's Government is the only legal government of China today, and the delegation it sends to participate in the United Nations is also the only legal delegation of China. We have the right, we have the determination, and we also have the strength to participate in the United Nations. The obstruction of the US imperialists and their lackeys can only delay us temporarily. Sooner or later, we will still enter. This is the formal beginning of our international struggle. Like the domestic struggle, victory will ultimately be ours.

### 我们应当出席联合国！

　　我们应当出席联合国！
    张奚若
    第一次世界大战结束后，战胜各国，为保持世界和平，组织了一个所谓国际联盟。不幸这个国际联盟后来竟为少数强国所把持所利用而失掉它原来的意义。第二次世界大战结束后，战胜各国又组织了一个联合国。今日不幸，这个联合国中的几个组成分子，几个帝国主义的分子，又在企图利用联合国这个机构做他们压迫弱小民族，反对社会主义及新民主主义国家的工具。凡是能为这些帝国主义者做工具，做仆从的国家，他们是延之惟恐不多，得之惟恐不快。反之，凡是反对阶级压迫，反对帝国主义侵略，真正为广大人民的利益服务的国家，他们便感觉万分头痛，拒之惟恐不远，疾之惟恐不深。今日成功湖所演的保留国民党代表团的丑剧，其意义就在这里。这与美帝国主义者这几年来在中国支持蒋介石的反革命战争，在朝鲜制造李承晚傀儡政府，在日本扶持已倒的法西斯分子，在欧洲反对希腊的革命战争，推行马歇尔计划，签订北大西洋公约，勾结铁托，利用佛朗哥，都是一连串的异曲同工的猴儿戏。
    美帝国主义者和他们的喽啰们反对开除蒋廷黻代表团的借口是说这个代表团是“合法”的。按照这个不通的逻辑，一个代表团，不管它实际上有没有国家可代表，有没有人民要它代表，只要它自己硬说它能代表，只要想利用它做傀儡的外国政府情愿叫它代表，只要它在过去若干年以前曾经为想利用它的人承认过，那它就永远是“合法”的，那怕它所代表的那个所谓政府的招牌已经由南京挂到广州，由广州挂到重庆，由重庆挂到成都，由成都挂到台北，将来还要由台北挂到马尼剌或华盛顿哩。帝国主义者，尤其是他们的盟主美帝国主义者，这种无赖的作法，并不足以伤损中国人民的尊严，也不能长期地侵害中国国家的利益，只是把他们自己弄成世界上一种最无聊最下流的笑话而已。
    联合国产生的原意和它的宪章的目的都是要保卫世界和平，并不是要推动世界战争。我们中国今日为自己为人类也是要和平而不要战争。因此，我们是支持以保卫世界和平为目的的联合国的，而且是需要参加到联合国里面去支持它。参加联合国是我们的权利，也是我们的义务。凡是侵犯这种权利妨害这个义务者，都是我们的敌人。我们的中央人民政府是今日中国唯一的合法政府，由它所派出的参加联合国的代表团也是中国唯一的合法代表团。我们有权利，我们有决心，我们也有力量，去参加联合国。美帝国主义者和他们的喽啰们的阻挠，至多只能延宕暂时，不久我们还是要进去的。这是我们国际斗争的正式开始。和国内斗争一样，胜利终是我们的。
