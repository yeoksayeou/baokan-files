　　Mentougou Heishan Coal Mine No. 1 and No. 2 Wells
    Advancement Efficiency Doubled
    Reduced Costs by Over 9,000 Jin of Millet Last Month
    [Our Newspaper] Since the launch of the labor competition in the Heishan Branch of Mentougou Coal Mine's No. 1 and No. 2 wells from New Year's Day this year, advancement has increased from 0.7-0.8 meters per day to 1.2-1.3 meters. On January 23rd, No. 1 well took the lead in setting a new record of 1.5 meters per day, and on the 25th, No. 2 well also caught up. Due to the doubled advancement efficiency, the cost of No. 1 well was reduced by 97 jin of millet per meter, and the cost of No. 2 well was reduced by 210 jin of millet per meter; the total cost reduction for both wells in the entire month was over 9,000 jin of millet.
    The creation of new records, in addition to the improvement of the work system and wage system, is mainly due to:
    1. The administration and the trade union care for the workers, go deep into the work in the well, solve problems in a timely manner, and patiently persuade the masses. When the mine discussed the production plan, the administration agreed to issue raincoats and water boots, solving the difficulties of some workers working in water.
    2. The mine started construction in July last year, and it has been able to achieve repeated successes under extremely difficult conditions, which is inseparable from the work of the trade union. The leading cadres of the mine's trade union have accepted the lessons of the purely welfare-oriented viewpoint when they were at the Mentougou mine and have a clear understanding of "the trade union guarantees production" in their thinking; they actively understand the situation; the administration holds production meetings, and the trade union must participate, and then actively promote it to the workers. The production plan is posted in the trade union office, and the workers talk about production issues when they come to the trade union.
    3. The new style of supervisors: The current supervisors are all experienced in production and have prestige among the workers. Some are promoted from among the workers. Some have undergone political study, are responsible in their work, have a democratic style, and have correct mass viewpoints. They pay great attention to safety, provide workers with various guidance, and often help workers drill holes and blast, so they are deeply supported and welcomed by the workers. The administrative work arrangements can be carried out smoothly through the supervisors. The previous phenomenon of opposition between supervisors and workers no longer exists.
    4. The leading role of Party and Youth League members: For example, Li Jishen, a Party member in No. 2 well, should take a break after drilling holes and blasting, but he still loads slag and doesn't idle at all. When repairing water faucets, it is very cold, and Party members often take the lead in going into the water.
    The competition in February will continue. In response to the shortcomings in January, the focus of work is:
    1. Although the two wells have achieved a record of 1.5 meters of advancement per day, the task has not been fully completed. In addition to the untimely power supply from Shijingshan, the failure of the mine's water pump from time to time is also an important reason affecting production. The electromechanical department was not involved in the competition in January. In February, they will be called upon to participate to ensure that the water pump does not fail or fails less frequently.
    2. The achievement of doubling the advancement efficiency in January was mainly due to the improvement of the wage system, which stimulated the workers' enthusiasm for production, increased labor intensity, and reduced gaps in work. There are still very few improvements and creations in technology. In the future, workers will be called upon to work hard in this direction.
    [Another News] Mentougou Chengzi Coal Mine, the newly opened No. 2 inclined shaft, also increased its advancement from 0.7 meters per day to 1.1 meters on February 1st due to the change from a one-yuan shift (24 hours) piece rate to a three-shift piece rate wage system.

### 门头沟黑山煤矿一、二号井  进尺效率提高一倍  上月减低成本九千余斤小米

　　门头沟黑山煤矿一、二号井
    进尺效率提高一倍     
    上月减低成本九千余斤小米
    【本报讯】门头沟煤矿黑山分矿一、二号井，从今年元旦发起劳动竞赛以来，进尺由日进○·七、八粎，提高到一·二、三粎；元月二十三日，又首由一号井再创日进一·五粎之新纪录，二十五日，二号井也迎头赶上。由于进尺效率提高了一倍，使一号井成本每尺减低九十七斤小米，二号井每尺减低二百一十斤小米；全月两井共减低成本九千余斤小米。
    新纪录的创造，除因工作制度、工资制度的改进外，主要还有：
    一、行政、工会关心工人，深入井下工作，及时解决问题，耐心说服群众。该矿讨论生产计划时，行政上答应发给雨衣、水靴，解决了部分工人水中工作的困难。
    二、该矿从去年七月开工，在条件极端困难的情况下，能屡创成绩，和工会工作是分不开的。该矿工会领导干部接受原在门矿时单纯福利观点的教训，对“工会保证生产”在思想上有了明确认识；主动地了解情况；行政上召开生产会议，工会一定参加，然后积极向工人宣传。工会屋子里贴着生产计划，工人到工会谈的也是生产问题。
    三、监工人员的新作风：现在的监工人员都是生产经验丰富、在工人中有威信的人物。有的是工人中提拔的。有的经过政治学习，工作负责、作风民主，有正确的群众观点。他们很注意安全，给工人各种指导，并常帮助工人打眼、放炮，因此深得工人群众的拥护和欢迎。行政上的工作布置，通过监工可顺利进行。从前监工和工人对立的现象已不存在。
    四、党、团员的带头作用：如二号井党员李纪深，打好眼，放完炮便该歇一会，但他还要装碴，一点不闲。在修水笼头时，天很冷，党员常带头下水。
    二月份该矿竞赛仍然继续，针对元月份缺点，工作重点为：
    一、两井虽创了日进一·五粎的成绩，但任务尚未全部完成。除石景山供电不能及时外，该矿水泵时出毛病，也是影响生产的重要原因。元月份竞赛时，机电部门并未卷入。二月份将号召他们参加，保证水泵不出或少出毛病。
    二、一月份进尺效率提高一倍的成绩，主要是因为工资制度的改进，激发了工人的生产积极性，提高了劳动强度，减少了工作中的空隙所致。而在技术上的改进、创造，还很少见。今后将号召工人朝这个方向努力。
    【又讯】门头沟城子煤矿，新开二号斜井，亦因由一元班（二十四小时）计件改为三小班计件工资制，进尺由日进○·七粎，于二月一日提高到一·一粎。
