　　Introducing the Card Registration and Inspection Method in Document Processing
　　Li Jianfei
    The characteristics of document processing in high-level leading organizations are: 1. More leaders review documents, and the process of circulation and approval is more extensive; 2. The higher the level of the organization, the more detailed the division of labor, and the more specialized departments there are. Matters often involve several relevant departments, resulting in more frequent consultations and increased document transfer. Therefore, if the document management department does not conduct inspections, it can easily lead to backlog, delays, and even loss. Therefore, it is necessary to establish an effective registration and inspection system. The former Secretariat of the North China People's Government and the current General Office of the Political and Legal Affairs Commission have studied and established a "card registration and inspection" system in response to this situation. Since its trial implementation, it has been found to be very helpful for mastering documents and is currently being further researched and improved. The following is a brief introduction:

    I. Card: Printed on hard paper, each with a thin sheet of paper attached (as a stub). The registration is done in one writing, creating a duplicate. Several copies are bound into a booklet. The card lists the issuing organization, document number, date of receipt and dispatch, abstract, attachments, processing status, remarks, etc. Different colors are used to distinguish the nature of the documents (e.g., red, yellow, and white for urgent, important, and ordinary documents, respectively) to make them stand out, or "urgent" or "important" can be marked on the card.

    II. Card Bag: (A wooden cabinet with several small compartments can also be used) Its basic rule is: one side lists the names of the issuing organizations; the other side lists the various stages of document processing. It can be used flexibly according to different situations.

    III. Usage: After receiving a document, enter it on the card (routine administrative documents, such as departmental communications, the use of official seals, etc., that have no problems and do not require processing, are not entered on the card). Note "urgent" or "important," and indicate the card number on the upper side of the document. As the document moves, the card also moves in the card bag. When the document is transferred to a certain stage of processing, the card is also moved to that compartment, and the processing status is noted in the processing status column of the card. Once the document is completed, the card is collected and stored.

    IV. Using Cards for Inspection: According to the above method, it is clear which department is handling each matter and to what extent it has been processed. Inspection and follow-up can be carried out in a focused and timely manner according to the degree of importance and urgency, and the processing status is recorded in detail on the card until it is completed.

    (II) Since the trial implementation, the system has the following advantages:

    I. Because the outstanding documents are all marked by cards, and concentrated in order on the card bag, all outstanding documents are prominently displayed and easily visible, which is convenient for inspection. In the past, the registration book method was used, and although there was also a column for processing status, the completed and outstanding documents were mixed together, making inspection extremely inconvenient. Cards can clearly distinguish between completed and outstanding documents. Therefore, it is very helpful for inspection work. Because timely inspection and follow-up can be carried out, document backlog and delays can be avoided and reduced (as experience has shown in recent months), improving efficiency.

    II. Because the card records the processing status of each issue in detail, and it is a loose-leaf system, it can be statistically analyzed at any time according to work needs, which is also very convenient for summarizing work.

    (III) Issues to be noted in implementing the card system:

    I. Document registration must be closely integrated with inspection work; otherwise, isolated registration is meaningless. Moreover, the combination of registration and inspection can ensure the continuity of the matter, avoid discrepancies, and save manpower and time.

    II. The principle of "centralized leadership, division of responsibility" should be implemented: Under unified leadership, those responsible for registration and inspection should have a clear division of labor, maintain close contact, proactively understand the intentions of the leadership, distinguish between the degree of importance and urgency, and conduct inspections at any time or regularly.

    III. It is necessary to maintain close contact with relevant departments and the various stages of processing to understand their situation, so that inspection work can be carried out appropriately. (Rigid, unyielding pressure is not a good inspection method.)

    IV. The "processing status" column of the card must record the entire processing status, not only the processing process, but also the processing result, until it is completed.

    In addition, it is also necessary to establish some necessary auxiliary systems according to needs, such as a registration book for files to be consulted (for registering informational documents and files for future reference), but it is necessary to prevent adding unnecessary procedures.

    We are not doing well enough now. The main shortcomings are: (1) Inspection work is only simple urging, and has failed to discover problems from statistical summaries and provide reference for leadership, so that registration and inspection work remains at a purely technical level. (2) There is insufficient communication between the handlers, and some documents fail to register certain stages of the processing, making them difficult to find. Improvements are currently being studied. (Attached picture)

    Explanation: If a document is received from Department A, it is first sent to the General Office for review, and the card is placed in compartment (1); after review, it is sent to Chief A, and the card is moved to compartment (2); after the chief reviews it, it is assigned to Division ×× for handling, and the card is moved to compartment (3); if it is approved and assigned, the card is placed in compartment (4); the draft is sent for review again, and the card is moved to compartments (1) and (2); after it is approved and sent for printing, the card is moved to compartment (5); after printing, sealing, and dispatch, the card is moved to compartment (6). And so on.

　　介绍文件处理中的卡片登记检查法
　　李剑飞
    高级领导机关在文件处理上的特点是：１、核阅文件的首长较多，传阅批办过程多；２、越到高级机关，分工越细，专管部门较多，而事情往往牵涉到若干有关部门，因之来往会商多，增加了文件递转运行的次数。因此，掌管文件的部门如检查不到，即易致积压、拖延，甚至丢失。因此，建立有效的登记检查制度，就很必要。前华北人民政府秘书处与现在政法委员会办公厅针对此种情形，研究建立了一种“卡片登记检查”制度。试行以来，感到对掌握文件很有帮助，现正进一步研究改善。兹先介绍如下：
    一、卡片：用硬纸印制，每张上并复一张薄纸（作存根），登记时一次复写而成，若干份装订一册。卡片列载来文机关、收发文字号、收发文时间、摘由、附件、处理情形、备考等栏并用不同颜色区别文件性质，（如用红、黄、白三色，分别文件之急、要、平）以求醒目，或在卡片上标明“急”“要”亦可。
    二、卡片袋：（用带若干小格子的木柜亦可）其基本规律是：一边开列来文机关名称；一边开列文件处理过程各环节。可根据不同情况，灵活运用。
    三、使用方法：收文后，分别登入卡片，（日常事务文件，如机关联系，启用印信等文件，无问题、不需要处理者，即不登卡片）。注明“急”“要”，并在文件上边注明卡片字号。随着文件的运转，卡片也在文件袋上运转，文件转到那一环节处理，卡片亦就移置于那一格中，并随时在卡片的处理情形栏内注明，文件办结即将卡片收起汇存。
    四、利用卡片进行检查：按照以上做法，每一件事情现在何部门办理？办到何种程度？都很清楚，可以分别轻重缓急，有重点地及时检查催办，并随时将办理情形详载于卡片上，直至办结为止。
    （二）试行以来，感到这一制度有以下的好处：
    一、由于未结文件都以卡片为标志，有秩序地集中在卡片袋上，可使全部未结文件突出地表现出来，了然在目，便于进行检查工作。过去采用登记簿办法，虽也有处理情形一栏的登记，但因已结与未结者掺杂在一起，致检查极感不便，而卡片能将已结、未结明确区分开来。故对检查工作大有帮助。由于能及时检查催办，即可避免与减少文件的积压与拖延（几月来经验证明如此），使效率提高起来。
    二、由于卡片详细登记着每一问题的处理情形，并且是活页的，故可随时根据工作需要加以统计，对总结工作也有很大方便。
    （三）实行卡片制应注意的几个问题：
    一、文件登记必须与检查工作密切结合，否则，孤立地进行登记，就没有意义。而且登记与检查结合，可使事情之处理前后衔接，不致分歧，又能节约人力、时间。
    二、应贯彻“集中领导，分工负责”的原则：在统一领导下，负责登记检查者，应明确分工，密切联系，并主动了解领导意图，分别轻重缓急，随时或定期地进行检查。
    三、应与有关各机关及各个处理过程中的环节密切联系，了解其情况，检查工作才能进行得恰当。（呆板的硬催，并不是好的检查办法。）
    四、卡片“处理情形”栏须要登记整个的处理情形，不仅要登记处理过程，而且更要登记处理结果，直至办结为止。
    此外，还须根据需要，建立些必要的辅助制度，如存查文件登记簿（登记资料性及存案备查的文件）等，但须防止增加不必要的手续。
    我们现在作得还不够好，主要缺点是：（一）检查工作只是单纯的催，未能从统计总结中发现问题，提供领导上参考，使登记检查工作仍停留在单纯的事务技术水平上。（二）各经办人之间联系不足，有个别文件，漏登处理过程中的某些环节，致难查找，现正研究改进。（附图片）
    说明：如甲部来文，先送办公厅阅即将卡片置于（1）格内；阅后又送甲首长，即将卡片移置于（2）格；首长阅后，批交××处办，即将卡片移置于（3）格；如批示后交办，即将卡片置于（4）格；稿件再送核，卡片又移于（1），（2）格；判行后付印，卡片即移于（5）格；毕印封发 ，卡片即移于（6）格。余类推。
