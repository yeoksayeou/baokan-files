The meeting first heard a report from Minister Xie Juezai of the Ministry of Internal Affairs on the current national disaster relief work. The consensus was that although the disaster situation in various places is very serious, as long as organization and leadership are strengthened, the policy of production for disaster relief is further implemented, and concrete help is provided to solve the problems of funds, raw materials, and sales for the people affected by the disaster in their production, and in close combination with economic departments, timely transportation and allocation of grain, coupled with government relief and mutual assistance among the masses, we have full confidence in overcoming the famine. The Central Disaster Relief Committee is also under discussion for formation. Subsequently, Minister Shi Liang of the Ministry of Justice reported on the process of studying the lawyer system, believing that the old lawyer system was one of the tools used by the Kuomintang reactionary government to oppress the people through legal and judicial systems, and must be abolished. Regarding the establishment of a new lawyer system based on the people's judicial system, the Ministry of Justice is responsible for continuing to study and discuss with relevant parties. The meeting also heard a preliminary summary of Secretary-General Tao Xijin's experience in implementing the spirit of streamlining and reorganizing the organizational structure of the Political and Legal Affairs Committee and its affiliated ministries. Everyone agreed that these experiences should be promoted.

　　政法委员会六次委务会议
    谢部长报告救灾工作
    有充分信心渡过灾荒
    【新华社北京九日电】政务院政治法律委员会于二月七日召开第六次委务会议。会议首先听取了内务部谢觉哉部长关于目前全国救灾工作的报告，一致认为各地灾情虽甚严重，但只要加强组织与领导，进一步贯彻生产救灾的方针，具体帮助解决灾民生产中的资金、原料、销路等问题，并与经济部门密切结合，及时运输调度粮食，再加上政府的救济、群众的互助，则我们具有充分信心渡过灾荒。中央救灾委员会亦正在商洽筹组中。继由司法部史良部长报告研究律师制度问题的经过，认为旧的律师制度是国民党反动政府压迫人民的法律和司法制度的工具之一，必须废除。关于在人民司法制度的基础上建立新的律师制度问题，责成司法部继续与有关方面研究商讨。会议又听取了陶希晋秘书长关于政法委员会及所属各部会贯彻精简精神、整顿组织编制的初步经验总结。大家认为这些经验应加推广。会议并讨论了人民法庭组织通则草案，原案修正后将呈政务院审核。
