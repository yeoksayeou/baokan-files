Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, February 10th:

　　Terrified by the great victory of the Chinese and Vietnamese people, the U.S. is stepping up its arrangements for aggression in the Far East. Jessup's talks in Indonesia and Singapore repeatedly reveal his greed.

　　U.S. government's ambassador-at-large Jessup, sent to the Far East to conduct aggressive activities, has held secret talks in Indonesia with Sukarno and Hatta, and in Singapore with British High Commissioner for Southeast Asia, MacDonald, for the past ten days. He flew to Rangoon on the morning of the 8th. Jessup has been on his so-called "inspection" tour of the Far East since leaving the United States on December 20th last year, for more than a month and a half. During this period, Jessup has visited Japan, South Korea, Okinawa, Taiwan, the Philippines, Vietnam, Indonesia, Singapore, and other places. After "inspecting" Burma, Jessup will conclude his pre-Bangkok conference arrangements for aggression and will proceed directly from there to Bangkok to preside over the so-called "U.S. Far East Diplomats Conference" to discuss a comprehensive U.S. aggression plan for the Far East.

　　After arriving in Singapore from Jakarta, the capital of Indonesia, on the 5th, Jessup revealed plans for the United States to actively strengthen its aggressive actions in the Far East in a radio address in Singapore on the evening of the 6th, according to the United States Information Service. In his speech, he emphasized "the need for Western democracies to take urgent action in Southeast Asia." In order to cover up this aggressive plan of the United States, Jessup once again resorted to anti-Soviet lies, saying that the Soviet Union "is trying to conquer the people of Asia," while the policy of the United States is committed to their "independence and development." However, the Asian people, who have suffered the scourge of slaughter and persecution by U.S. imperialism and other imperialists, have experienced the "independence and development" given by U.S. imperialism most profoundly, which is another name for enslavement and oppression. What is most surprising is that Jessup, a notorious imperialist, actually said, "We are particularly opposed to imperialism," without the slightest sense of shame. Jessup also proposed Truman's economic aggression plan, the so-called "Point Four Program," "as an example of the United States' willingness to help other nations develop themselves," saying that this plan could achieve "common prosperity" for all nations. Japanese fascists before Jessup had greatly promoted "coexistence and co-prosperity," and the Asian people will never forget what that phrase means.

　　Due to the great victory of the Chinese people and the recent new developments in the situation in Vietnam, U.S. imperialism is stepping up arrangements for a so-called "anti-communist defense line" from Indonesia to Malaya, Vietnam, Thailand, Burma, and even India, and its evil hand is first extended to Vietnam. According to a report from the United Press, Jessup said in Singapore on the 6th: "When the United States decides where to draw the line of defense against communism in Southeast Asia, it should give careful consideration to Vietnam." According to a report by the Kuomintang Central News Agency, Jessup claimed that the United States would provide all assistance, even military assistance, to the reactionaries in Southeast Asian countries to suppress the liberation movements of the people of various countries.

　　Jessup also revealed the greed of U.S. imperialism towards Indonesia while in Jakarta. According to a statement by Jessup cited by Agence France-Presse on the 2nd, "The relationship between the United States and Indonesia is of great importance." "Indonesia and the United States have broad common interests." The recent influx of American monopoly capitalists such as Fox is the best annotation of the "common interests of Indonesia and the United States" that Jessup spoke of.

　　惊惧中越人民伟大胜利
    美加紧布置侵略远东       
    耶塞普在印尼星岛谈话一再表露贪欲
    【新华社北京十日电】美国政府派来远东进行侵略活动的无任所大使耶塞普，旬日以来，分别在印尼与苏加诺及哈达，在新加坡与英国驻东南亚高级专员麦克唐纳等人举行秘密会谈，并于八日晨飞赴仰光。耶塞普自去年十二月二十日离美开始其所谓远东“视察”旅行以来，已达一个半月以上。在此期间，耶塞普已到过日本、南朝鲜、冲绳、台湾、菲律宾、越南、印尼、新加坡等地。耶塞普在缅甸“视察”后，即结束其曼谷会议会前的侵略布置，并将从该地迳赴曼谷，主持商订美国对远东全盘侵略计划的所谓“美国远东外交人员会议”。
    耶塞普于五日由印尼首都雅加达抵达新加坡后，据美国新闻处消息，他于六日晚在新加坡发表广播演说，透露了美国积极加强其在远东的侵略行动的计划。他在演说中强调“西方民主国家有在东南亚采取紧急行动的必要。”为了掩盖美国的这一侵略计划，耶塞普再次乞灵于反苏的谎言；说什么苏联“力图征服亚洲人民”，而美国的政策却是致力于他们的“独立和发展”。但是身受美国等帝国主义屠戮逼害之祸的亚洲人民，对于美帝国主义所给予的“独立和发展”，已经体验得最为深刻，这就是奴役和压迫的代称。最令人吃惊的是，一个人人皆知的凶恶的帝国主义分子耶塞普却说：“我们特别反对帝国主义”，而竟无丝毫愧色。耶塞普并提出杜鲁门的经济侵略计划即所谓“第四点计划”，“作为美国帮助其他民族自行发展的愿望的一个例子”，他说，这个计划可以达到一切民族的“共同繁荣”。日本法西斯在耶塞普之前，就大事宣扬过“共存共荣”，亚洲人民决不会忘记这句话的意思。
    由于中国人民的伟大胜利与最近越南形势的新发展，美帝国主义正加紧布置从印尼到马来亚、越南、泰国、缅甸直至印度的所谓“反共防线”，而其魔手首先是伸向越南。据合众社消息耶塞普六日在新加坡说：“美国决定在东南亚何处划定防共界线时，当对越南加以慎重考虑。”据国民党中央社报道，耶塞普声称美国要以一切援助甚至军事援助，给予东南亚各国反动派，以镇压各国人民的解放运动。
    耶塞普在雅加达时，也表露了美帝国主义对印尼的贪欲。据法新社二日引耶塞普的谈话称：“美国与印尼之间的关系有很大的重要性”。“印尼与美国有广泛的共同利益”。最近美国独占资本家福克斯之流正像蝗虫一般地飞到印尼，这就是耶塞普口中所说的“印尼与美国共同利益”的最好注脚。
