　　Assisting Junior Cadre Study
　　Northeast Holds Radio Lectures
　　Systematic Lectures on Political Economy Planned for This Year
　　[This newspaper dispatch] Northeast News: The Propaganda Department of the Northeast Bureau of the CCP Central Committee and the Propaganda Department of the Shenyang Municipal Committee of the CCP have successively held radio lectures to assist the study of junior group trainees among cadres on the job. The radio lectures sponsored by the Propaganda Department of the Northeast Bureau began in the second half of last year. According to representatives from forty-five agencies, factories, and enterprises in Shenyang, the radio lectures have played a certain role in organizing and promoting the study of junior group cadres, systematically helping listeners understand the content of their studies. However, the radio lectures of the Propaganda Department of the Northeast Bureau are held on Wednesday afternoons, which is extremely inconvenient for factory cadres to listen to. Therefore, the Propaganda Department of the Shenyang Municipal Committee has also set up radio lectures specifically for junior group cadres in factories. The content and progress are basically the same as the radio lectures of the Propaganda Department of the Northeast Bureau. Starting from February 10, broadcasts will be aired every Monday and Friday morning from 7:00 to 8:00 (broadcast by the Shenyang People's Radio Station employee station, wavelength 760 kilocycles, 394.7 meters), with plans to complete the lectures on political economy within this year, divided into six chapters and eighteen topics, broadcast eighty-six times.
　　During the six months that the Propaganda Department of the Northeast Bureau has been holding radio lectures, the following preliminary experiences have been obtained based on the opinions of representatives from various listening units.
　　(1) Radio lectures should organize special reports based on the central ideas of the chapters in the study texts to help listeners understand each central issue and also to facilitate lecturers in collecting materials from various sources; it is not necessary to teach according to the order of the study texts, as this makes it difficult to grasp the central issues or to coordinate with the self-study process. Lecturers should be fixed, and if there are multiple lecturers, there should be regular meetings to discuss the plan of division of labor, so as to avoid repetition or omission of important content. When lecturers are changed, more attention should be paid to the continuity of the content. The time of radio lectures should be adapted to the work and study schedules of the agencies. The speed of explanation should be such that it is easy to take simple notes. The lecturer's spoken language should be Mandarin, and unfamiliar words and phrases should be explained in more detail. More supplementary materials and more examples should be prepared, and it is best to cite practical examples related to the thinking and work of cadres in various departments. At the beginning of each paragraph, there should be a brief and complete outline, followed by analysis, explanation with examples, and finally a comprehensive summary. After the lecture, discussion questions should be given, and the scope of the next lecture should be reported, specifying the highest and lowest reference books. After each unit is completed, it is best to have a question-and-answer session and print and distribute the next outline or publish it in the newspaper.
　　(2) For each unit to listen to the radio lectures, is a better form of learning that suits the characteristics of the city, the Party and the administration should pay attention to leadership. For example, organize cadres to preview before listening, point out the scope and read certain books; organize discussions and seminars after listening, check and supervise at any time, answer questions and doubts, or collect questions to report to leading agencies, etc. When organizing cadres to listen, attention should be paid to the appropriateness of the level of cadres, and it should not be forced to organize everyone to listen together. In addition, listening to radio lectures is only one form of learning for on-the-job cadres, and the organization and ideological leadership of regular learning should not be relaxed because there are radio lectures.

　　辅助初级组干部学习
    东北举办广播讲座           
    本年内有系统地讲政治经济学
    【本报讯】东北消息：中共中央东北局宣传部暨沈阳市委宣传部，先后举办了广播讲座，以辅助在职干部中初级组学员的学习。东北局宣传部主办的广播讲座于去年下半年开始。据沈阳市内四十五个机关、工厂、企业部门的代表反映，广播讲座对于组织与推动初级组干部的学习起了一定的作用，有系统地帮助了听讲者对学习内容的了解。但东北局宣传部的广播讲座，时间在每周星期三午后，工厂干部收听极为不便。因之沈阳市委宣传部又专为工厂初级组干部设立了广播讲座。其内容和进度基本上与东北局宣传部的广播讲座相同。定于二月十日起，每逢星期一、五早晨七时至八时广播（由沈阳人民电台职工台播出，波长七六○千周，三九四·七公尺），预定本年内讲完政治经济学，共分六章十八个讲题，播讲八十六次。
    在东北局宣传部举办广播讲座的六个月中，根据各收听单位代表的意见，得出下列初步经验。
    （一）广播讲座应根据学习读本的章节中心，组织专题报告，以帮助听者理解每个中心问题，同时也便于讲师多方搜集材料；不一定按学习的读本顺序教下去，这样不容易领会中心问题，或与自学过程配合不上。讲师应该固定，如有多数讲师，则应有定期会议，讨论计划分工，以免发生重复或遗漏重要内容。在讲师更动时，更须注意内容的衔接。广播讲座的时间，应适应机关工作与学习的作息时间。讲解速度以照顾到能记下简单笔记为好。讲师的口语以普通话为好，遇有生疏词句要多加解释。要多准备补充材料，多举实例，最好能举与各部门干部思想、业务有关的实际例子。每一段落开始时，要有简要完整的提纲，然后进行分析、举例讲解，最后综合总结。讲完后出讨论题，并报告下次讲演范围，指定最高与最低的参考书。每一单元讲完后，最好有一次问题解答，并把下次提纲印发或刊登在报纸上。
    （二）各单位收听广播讲座，是适合城市特点的一种较好的学习形式，党与行政应注意领导。如听讲前组织干部预习，指出范围读一定的书；听讲后组织讨论、座谈，随时检查督促，解答疑难，或收集问题汇报领导机关等。在组织干部收听时，应注意干部程度高低的适当，不应勉强把大家组织一起来听。此外，收听广播讲座只是在职干部学习的一种形式，不能因为有了广播讲座，而放松了经常学习的组织领导与思想领导。
