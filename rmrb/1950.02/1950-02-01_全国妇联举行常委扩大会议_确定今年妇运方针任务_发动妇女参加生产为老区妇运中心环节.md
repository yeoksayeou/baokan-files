Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, January 31st: The All-China Democratic Women's Federation held its first Standing Committee Enlarged Meeting of this year on January 28th. Thirteen Standing Committee members and fourteen Executive Committee members and alternate Executive Committee members in Beijing attended. Vice Chairman Li Dequan presided.

　　Deng Yingchao Reports

At the meeting, Vice Chairman Deng Yingchao reported on the guiding principles and tasks of the Chinese women's movement in 1950 and the key points of the All-China Democratic Women's Federation's work. She pointed out: The Chinese women's movement in 1950 is to continue to implement the resolutions of the First National Women's Congress on the basis of the development of the Chinese women's movement in 1949, and to more broadly mobilize and organize women to carry out the four major tasks of the Chinese people this year: 1. Women across the country must continue to support the People's Liberation Army in liberating Taiwan, Hainan Island, and Tibet. 2. In the old and new liberated areas, women's federation cadres should make the greatest efforts to mobilize and organize women to participate in industrial, agricultural, and sideline production, and in disaster areas, they must especially mobilize women to engage in production for self-relief. At the same time, women in all cities must assist the government in promoting the People's Victory Public Bonds to overcome financial difficulties. Women's federation cadres at all levels should maintain a simple and hardworking style, practice thrift, and oppose extravagance and waste. 3. In the newly liberated areas, women's work cadres should cooperate with the steps of local work, mobilize women to participate in movements against local bullies, rent reduction, and land distribution, and pay attention to removing feudal traditional customs that bind women. 4. We must continue to strengthen the unity of the people and women of all strata across the country, and continue to strengthen the great unity of Chinese women with Asian women and world women; women in all regions must actively participate in local people's representative conferences; women's federations in all regions should improve their democratic united front work. Among the above tasks, mobilizing and organizing women to participate in production is the central link in the women's movement in the old liberated areas. Around this central task, we must carry out women's and children's welfare undertakings, improve women's political and cultural level, consolidate and expand women's organizations, and cultivate and improve women's work cadres.

All-China Women's Federation Work Points

Vice Chairman Deng Yingchao pointed out: The main work of the All-China Democratic Women's Federation this year is to assist local women's federations in strengthening their work with emphasis, and at the same time to participate in the activities of the International Democratic Women's Federation in a planned and prepared manner. The All-China Women's Federation will specifically stipulate the work priorities and steps for each period of this year accordingly. After discussing Vice Chairman Deng Yingchao's report, the meeting immediately basically adopted two drafts on the guiding principles and tasks of the Chinese women's movement in 1950 and the key points of women's work in 1950.
