Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 7th. The recent failure of the Philippine government army and police to attack the People's Liberation Army of the Philippines in Central Luzon has caused infighting within the Philippine ruling class. The Philippine government army and police launched two "powerful offensives" against the People's Liberation Army positions on January 16th and January 28th. According to Reuters, in the January 28th offensive, Philippine troops mobilized seventeen security companies, assisted by artillery tank units and fighter planes, to launch a large-scale attack on the People's Anti-Japanese Army strongholds in central and northern Luzon. However, after five days of fighting, there was no progress. Therefore, the Philippine constabulary had to declare on February 1 that "operations may soon cease."

Due to the repeated failures of the Philippine government army's "suppression" efforts, some other running dogs of U.S. imperialism have issued calls to replace the leaders of the Philippine Army and constabulary. According to a Kuomintang Central News Agency report from Manila on the 1st, Montano, chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, who leads the government party's majority group in the Philippine Senate, denounced these two forces for "leadership incompetence." He said, "They allowed a year ago to eliminate the rebels within a year, but they did not fulfill this promise," and pointed out that the activities of the People's Liberation Army of the Philippines "have threatened the security of American base facilities in the Philippines." Montano then threatened the leaders of the Philippine military and police: If the Philippine armed forces "cannot complete the task of suppressing communist guerrillas within six months," he will unite with senators to demand the dismissal of Secretary of National Defense Connelio, Secretary of the Interior Baruyot, who is in charge of the constabulary, Army Chief of Staff Castaneda, and constabulary Commander Ramos. According to the Kuomintang Central News Agency, Montano's remarks "received the sympathy of the U.S. military stationed in the Philippines."

Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 7th. TASS, New York, 6th. The U.S. Compass newspaper carried a report by Steele stating that General Harding, Commander-in-Chief of the British Army in Southeast Asia, has requested the dispatch of auxiliary forces from India, Pakistan, Australia, and other countries of the British Empire to participate in the war against the Malayan patriots. Steele pointed out that the British authorities are extremely alarmed by their inability to suppress the Malayan resistance movement.

    菲政府军进攻失败
    哈丁哀叫增援马来亚侵略军
    【新华社北京七日电】菲律宾政府军警最近进攻中吕宋菲律宾人民解放军的失败，引起了菲律宾统治阶级内部的争吵。菲政府军警曾于一月十六日与一月二十八日对菲人民解放军阵地发动两次“强大攻势”。据路透社称，在一月二十八日进攻中、菲军警曾出动十七个警备连，并以炮兵坦克部队及战斗机协助，大举进攻吕宋中部与北部的民抗军据点。但作战五日，毫无进展。因此，菲警备队方面不得不于二月一日表示：“作战不久可能停止”。
    由于菲政府军“清剿”工作的一再失败，美帝国主义的另一些走狗，已发出撤换菲陆军及警备队领导人物的叫嚣。据国民党中央社马尼拉一日消息，领导菲参议院政府党多数集团的参院财政委员会主席孟泰洛，斥责这两种部队“领导上的无能”。他说：“他们在一年前曾允许在一年内肃清叛军，但他们并未实行这个诺言”，并指出菲律宾人民解放军的活动，“已威胁到美国在菲的基地设备的安全”。孟泰洛继即向菲律宾军警的领导人物提出威胁：如果菲政府武装部队“不能在六个月内完成镇压共产党游击队的任务”，他将联合各参议员要求罢免国防部长康利容、管辖警备队的内政部长巴鲁约特、陆军参谋长卡斯塔尼达及警备队总司令拉莫斯。据国民党中央社称：孟泰洛这种言论，“获得驻菲美军的同情”。
    【新华社北京七日电】塔斯社纽约六日讯：美国指南针日报载斯蒂尔的报道称：英国驻东南亚陆军总司令哈丁将军，要求从印度、巴基斯坦、澳大利亚及英帝国的其他国家派遣辅助部队，参加对马来亚爱国者的战争。斯蒂尔指出：英国当局对于他们不能镇压马来亚的抵抗运动一事，极为惊惧。
