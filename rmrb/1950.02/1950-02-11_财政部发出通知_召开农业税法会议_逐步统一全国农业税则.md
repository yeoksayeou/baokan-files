　　[Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 9th] The Central People's Government Ministry of Finance has decided to convene an agricultural tax law meeting in April to discuss and draft a new tax law, with the aim of gradually unifying national agricultural tax regulations. Participants in this meeting will include those in charge of agricultural tax administration from major administrative regions, provinces, and cities. The notice convening this meeting has already been issued. In order to ensure that the new tax law is truly practical, the notice requires that the finance departments of major administrative regions assist the finance departments of each province in selecting three or more typical villages for investigation and research. Combining the experience of the autumn tax collection last year, they should draft a draft of the 1950 Agricultural Tax Law to be submitted to the meeting for discussion. The notice also requires each province to provide detailed opinions on issues such as whether to levy taxes on land used for special local products, which is better to use: a tax exemption point or a tax threshold, how to stipulate tax rates and tax grades, and how to assess the normal land yield. The notice requires the finance departments of major administrative regions to review the above-mentioned opinions and draft agricultural tax laws submitted by the finance departments of each province, sign their opinions, and submit them to the Ministry of Finance before April 10.
