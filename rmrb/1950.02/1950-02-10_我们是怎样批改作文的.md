　　How We Grade Compositions
    Shijiazhuang No. 2 Middle School Chinese Language Teaching Group (Written by Liu Jia)
    The summary of the Shijiazhuang Municipal Middle School Chinese Language Teachers' Symposium last year proposed the following requirement for student compositions: "To be able to use simple and unadorned language to write about one's own thoughts and feelings." Based on this requirement, we examined the students' compositions and discovered two main deviations: one was the embellishment of words and phrases, pursuing the beauty of old forms; the other was the inability to grasp the center of the article, resulting in prolixity and disorder. For example, when writing about the founding of New China, students used sentences like "the sprouting, brand new New China"; also, one student who watched farmers practice boxing at the sports meet, digressed in his composition to how his grandfather practiced martial arts when he was young, and then stopped practicing when he got old. We studied the reasons for these phenomena, which were mainly due to the influence of the old education. One student said that his compositions were considered very "good" by his former teacher. He created bizarre and strange sentences, which the teacher marked with numerous circles and underlines, leading to today's habits. This illustrates a problem with students' attitudes toward writing: aiming too high, pursuing the beauty of old forms; or having no substantial content and using the "foggy method" to fill up the length. Therefore, we believe that teachers should first focus on ideological leadership, point out the direction of composition, and in addition to grading work, should also promptly combine writing methods to correct these deviations, and select some better works to post for everyone to observe and learn from.
    Secondly, in revising compositions, we usually pay attention to pointing out the following kinds of problems: in terms of content, it is an error in theme or ideological understanding; in terms of form, it is ungrammatical sentences, inappropriate use of words, or writing some lengthy and useless sentences. In addition to this, we advocate retaining as much of the student's original work as possible. It is inevitable that students' compositions are immature, and sometimes the sentence structure is a bit stiff, but it is developing in a good direction. If excessively deleted and revised, "nitpicking," it will dampen the students' writing enthusiasm and lose their confidence in writing. In terms of grading methods, we generally have teachers revise individually. For misspellings and typos, teachers generally mark them out and let the students correct them themselves. The method of correction is that in some classes, the students' misspellings are written on the blackboard for the students to correct. This allows students to have a deeper understanding of misspellings and prevent them from making the same mistakes next time; at the same time, it also achieves the effect of educating everyone.
    Some classes have tried using six symbols to mark out typos, misspellings, punctuation errors, ideological or factual errors, inappropriate use of words, and ungrammatical sentences, and then sent them to the group for collective revision. They are then taken back by the teacher for another revision, to correct the errors and deficiencies of the group revision, and to add comments. We believe that comments can point out the advantages and disadvantages of the article, point out the direction of students' writing efforts, and encourage students' writing enthusiasm. Students pay great attention to comments. Some students often add various symbols to the comments on their composition books to alert themselves. However, teachers should consider carefully when adding comments. Comments should be specific. Comments like "clear" and "smooth," which do not provide guidance, should be avoided. If it is difficult to add general comments, it may be better to add comments in separate points. Criticism should be accompanied by encouragement, and shortcomings should not be picked on blindly. Attention should be paid to the new good aspects of students, and their progress should be commended. Even if most of an article is not good, if there is even a little bit of good in it, it should not be denied. The traditional use of circles and underlines still needs to be adopted, which can encourage writing enthusiasm, but should not be overused.
    When returning composition papers in class, teachers should not only pay attention to praising the good and criticizing and correcting the bad, but also ignore students of average level or slow progress. For students who are making slow progress, attention should be paid to discovering their small progress, and commend them in a timely manner, so as to consolidate their existing achievements and accelerate their progress; at the same time, it can also motivate a group of students similar to them.
    According to our experience, most students cannot correctly use punctuation marks. This is a problem that is worth special mention. Because there is no usage of punctuation marks in the current middle school curriculum; and the level of general elementary schools is not good, and they have not taught the usage of punctuation marks well. Therefore, we plan to appropriately coordinate with the regular class to explain the usage of punctuation marks once next semester.

### 我们是怎样批改作文的

　　我们是怎样批改作文的
    石市二中国文教学小组（刘珈执笔）
    去年石家庄市中学国文教员座谈会的总结中，曾提出对学生作文的要求：“能用平易朴实的文字，写出自己的思想感情。”根据这个要求，我们检查了学生的作文，发现了两种主要的偏向：一种是字句的雕琢，追求旧形式的美；一种是掌握不住文章的中心，冗长杂乱。如在新中国成立时，学生作文中有“萌芽的、崭新的新中国”等类句子；又一个学生看了运动会农民的打拳，在作文里扯到他祖父幼时如何练武，后来老了，又不练了等。我们研究了这些现象发生的原因，主要是由于过去旧教育的影响。一个学生说，他的作文，旧日的老师认为很“好”。他造一些离奇古怪的句子，老师看了，圈点连篇。以致养成了今日的习惯。这里说明了一个学生习作态度问题：好高鹜远，追求旧形式美；或是本来没有充实的内容，而用“乌烟瘴气法”凑篇幅。因此我们认为教师应首先着重思想领导，指明作文的方向，除了批改工作外，更应及时结合作法纠正这些偏向，选出一些较好的作品张贴出来，以供大家观摩。
    其次，在修改作文中，我们通常注意指出下列几种毛病：属于内容上的，是主题错误或思想认识错误；属于形式上的是文句不通，用词不当或写一些冗长无用的句子。除此以外，我们主张尽可能多保留学生的原作。学生的作文幼稚是免不了的，有时造句也生硬一点，但是是在向好的方向发展的。如果过份地删改，“吹毛求疵”，便会打击学生的作文情绪，失掉了作文的信心。在批改的方法上，我们一般是由教员个别修改。对于错字、别字，一般是由教员标出来，交学生自己改正。改正的方式，有的班是把学生的错别字写在黑板上，让学生改的。这样可以使学生对于错别字有更深刻的认识，下次不致再犯同样毛病；同时也收到教育大家的效果。
    有的班试用了六种符号，分别标出别字、错字、标点错误、思想认识错误或事实错误、用词不当和文句不通的地方，然后发至小组集体修改。再拿回来由教员改一遍，以纠正小组修改的错误和小组修改之不足，并加批语。我们认为批语可以指出文章的优点缺点，指出学生作文的努力方向，鼓励学生的作文情绪。学生对于批语是非常注意的。有的学生常把作文簿上的批语加上各种符号，以便警惕自己。但教师加批时应慎重考虑。批语应该具体。不起指导作用的“明白”“通顺”一类批语，应该避免。如果概括加批困难，不妨分条加批。批评中应带鼓励，不可一味挑剔缺点。应当注意学生新的好的方面，表扬他的进步。一篇文章中，即使大部分不好，只要有一点好处也不可抹煞。传统用的圈点还需要采用，可以鼓励作文情绪，但不可滥用。
    在课堂上发回作文卷时，教员不应当只注意表扬好的，批评纠正坏的，而忽略了中等程度的或进步缓慢的同学。对进步较慢的学生，要注意发现他们细小的进步，及时表扬，使其巩固已有成绩和加速进步；同时也可以带动一部分和他类似的学生。
    根据我们的体验，大部分同学不能正确地使用标点符号。这是值得特别提出的问题。因为现在中学课程里没有标点符号使用法；而一般小学的程度都不好，没有把标点符号使用方法教好。因此，我们计划在下学期适当的配合正课讲述一次标点符号的使用法。
