　　[Beijing News] All circles in Beijing are extremely indignant at the Hong Kong British government police's violent suppression of workers, which resulted in a huge bloody tragedy, and lodged a serious protest. Xiao Ming, Director of the Preparatory Committee of the Beijing Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, said: Beijing workers were extremely angry and indignant upon hearing the news that the Hong Kong British government had carried out armed suppression against the Hong Kong worker brothers for their righteous actions, resulting in a bloody incident. We lodge a serious protest to the overbearing Hong Kong British government. We tell those culprits that the working class of the People's Republic of China, which has been liberated and victorious, will no longer tolerate any atrocities that oppress our worker brothers. The struggle of the Hong Kong worker brothers is not isolated. The 400,000 workers in Beijing will always be the backing of the Hong Kong worker brothers. We must transform pain and anger into strength, demand that the perpetrators be severely punished, the arrested workers be released immediately, and compensation be paid for the losses of the trade union and the injured workers. We will definitely support the reasonable demands of the Hong Kong worker brothers. Zhang Guojun of the Carpet and Wool Weaving Industry Union said: A few days ago, the British government hoped to establish diplomatic relations with China, but now the British police in Hong Kong have carried out armed suppression of our worker brothers, creating a bloody incident, fully exposing the hypocrisy and true face of imperialism.
　　Wang Xuezhen, Chairman of the Student Union of Peking University, said: This is a great insult to the Chinese people. We must lodge a serious protest against the atrocities of the Hong Kong British government police on the 30th. We firmly support the Hong Kong workers and 38 Chinese people's organizations. Professor Lin Handa, Director of the Education Department of Yenching University, said: The Hong Kong British government's oppression of tram workers and disruption of worker gatherings, resulting in a huge bloody tragedy, proves the hypocrisy of the British government's declaration to establish diplomatic relations with our country. Wang Ben?, a student of Yanjing University, said: We must remember this blood debt of the Hong Kong British government, we must resolutely protest, and we must resolutely support the reasonable demands of the Hong Kong workers.
　　[Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, 3rd] Workers and compatriots from all walks of life in Hong Kong, Kowloon, and Guangzhou are enthusiastically supporting the Hong Kong tram workers. Trade unions in Hong Kong and Kowloon have issued a letter to the public, denouncing the Hong Kong British government's brutal act of slaughtering workers. More than a thousand workers from the Hong Kong Telephone, Electricity, and Gas companies jointly expressed their sympathy to the tram workers on the evening of the 1st, and donated large amounts of money and goods to support them. Only two days after the bloody incident, the tram workers' union had received more than 8,200 Hong Kong dollars in donations from workers and compatriots from all walks of life in Hong Kong and Kowloon. All the workers of the Guangzhou Telecommunications Bureau have also written letters of sympathy and launched a donation campaign to support the Hong Kong tram workers, and called on all the workers in Guangzhou to respond to this movement.
