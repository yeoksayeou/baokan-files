Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 17th: Electone News Agency, Rome, 16th dispatch: The news of the signing of the Sino-Soviet treaty greatly embarrassed the reactionary and Catholic newspapers in Italy. For several weeks, these newspapers had been publishing the most idiotic nonsense provided by American news agencies about Mao Zedong's "long stay" in Moscow.

These newspapers were clearly speechless after being hit head-on. They tried to minimize the importance of the treaty as much as possible, publishing it on the bottom pages. They avoided writing editorials, preferring to wait for instructions from the U.S. State Department.

However, the communist and left-wing newspapers reflected the sentiments of the vast majority of the Italian people, and they unanimously praised this treaty as one of great historical importance. The Socialist Party's "Avanti!" said that this treaty "unites 700 million people against war."

　　意进步报纸一致赞美
    反动报纸受到迎头一棒
    【新华社北京十七日电】电通社罗马十六日讯：中苏缔结条约的消息，使意大利反动的和天主教的报纸大为狼狈，这些报纸在几个星期以来便一直在发表美国通讯社所供给的关于毛泽东《长久逗留》莫斯科的最愚蠢的废话。
    这些报纸显然被迎头一棒打得无话可说。它们企图尽量缩小条约的重要性，把它刊登在底页。他们避免作社评，而宁可听候美国国务院的提示。
    但是，共产党和左翼的报纸，则反映了绝大多数意大利人民的情绪，它们一致赞美这一条约为具有巨大历史重要性的条约。社会党的《前进报》说，这一条约“团结了七万万人民来反对战争”。
