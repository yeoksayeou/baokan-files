It is scheduled to premiere at Tiananmen Square at 12:00 noon today (the 23rd) and on the 25th; and at Dongdan Square at 12:00 noon on the 27th. The "Grand Song and Dance of National Construction" is collectively directed by Dai Ailian and others; the entire dance troupe, general studies department, opera troupe, and orchestra of the Central Academy of Drama are participating. During the rehearsals, the Ministry of Culture and the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China sent personnel to observe and provide guidance. This grand song and dance takes national construction as its theme and draws material from various dances of farmers, workers, and the army, navy, and air force, elevating the old Yangge dance and incorporating many new creations. It will serve as a demonstration for the new Yangge movement.
