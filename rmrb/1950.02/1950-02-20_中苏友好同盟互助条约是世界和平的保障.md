　　The Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance is a Guarantee of World Peace
    Fu Dingyi
    Due to the traditional friendship between the people of China and the Soviet Union, and the sincere cooperation between Marshal Stalin and Chairman Mao Zedong, the two nations of China and the Soviet Union signed the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance in Moscow on February 14th, as well as agreements on the Chinese Changchun Railway, Lushunkou (Port Arthur) and Dalian, and an agreement on Soviet loans to the People's Republic of China. These new treaties and new agreements are not only the most glorious page in China's diplomatic history of the past century, but will also play an immeasurably important role in consolidating world peace and combating the conspiracies and actions of the imperialists. As everyone knows, there are only two camps in the world today: one is the people's democratic camp headed by the Soviet Union; the other is the imperialist aggressive camp headed by US imperialism. China, with its vast territory and abundant resources, a population of 475 million, and a powerful People's Liberation Army, is undoubtedly a powerful force in the world peace camp. Therefore, since Chairman Mao went to Moscow, Wall Street could not help but be panic-stricken and flustered. US Secretary of State Acheson and others spread rumors everywhere, carrying out conspiracies of discord, such as fabricating "the Soviet Union is plotting to annex northern China," and so on. Now that the new Sino-Soviet treaty has been announced, all the rumors of imperialism will be shattered. The treaty clearly stipulates that "jointly prevent the resurgence of Japanese imperialism and the re-aggression of Japan or any other country that colludes with Japan in aggressive acts," which is sufficient to prove that the people of China and the Soviet Union will forever share weal and woe and common interests for the cause of world peace, and that it cannot be undermined by the conspiracies of US imperialism. As for the new agreement, it is a concrete manifestation of Soviet international morality, which greatly contributes to the economic development of the new China. Therefore, the new treaty and agreement are a guarantee for the cause of world peace. How can the warmongers not tremble!
    China is not isolated! The Chinese people will stand up even more strongly from now on! We thank Marshal Stalin for his brotherly love, and Chairman Mao Zedong for his hard work serving the people. We shout:
    Long live Sino-Soviet friendship and cooperation!

　　中苏友好同盟互助条约是世界和平的保障
    符定一
    由于中苏两国人民传统的友好和斯大林大元帅与毛泽东主席精诚合作的关系，中苏两国已于二月十四日在莫斯科签订了中苏友好同盟互助条约，及关于中国长春铁路、旅顺口及大连的协定和关于苏联贷款给中华人民共和国的协定。这些新的条约、新的协定，不仅是中国百年来外交史上最光荣的一页，而且在巩固世界和平的事业上，打击帝国主义者的阴谋与行动上将会发生绝大无比的作用。众所周知，现在世界上只有两个阵营：一个是以苏联为首的人民民主阵营；另一个是以美帝为首的帝国主义侵略阵营。而中国地大物博，拥有四亿七千五百万人口及强大的人民解放军，这在世界和平阵营中，无疑地是一支强大的力量。因此自毛主席赴莫斯科后，华尔街不由得不诚惶诚恐，手忙脚乱，由美国国务卿艾奇逊等人到处造谣，施行挑拨离间的阴谋，如捏造“苏联正谋兼并中国北部”等等。今中苏新的条约公布了，帝国主义的一切造谣，不攻自破。条约中更明白规定：“共同防止日本帝国主义之再起及日本或其他任何形式在侵略行为上与日本相勾结的国家之重新侵略”，足以证明中苏两国人民今后将永远为世界和平事业同患难、共利害，决非美帝阴谋所能破坏。至于新的协定，更是苏联国际道义的具体表现，大有助于新中国经济的发展。因此，新的条约和协定，对于世界和平事业是增加了保障，那怕战争贩子们不发抖咧！
    中国不是孤立的！中国人民从此更加坚强地站立起来了！我们感谢斯大林大元帅兄弟般的友爱，和毛泽东主席为人民服务的贤劳。我们高呼：
    中苏友好合作万岁！
