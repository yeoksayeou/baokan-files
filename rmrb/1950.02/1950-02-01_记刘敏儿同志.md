In Memory of Comrade Liu Min'er
　　Lin Dan
　　In the autumn of 1948, a shocking incident occurred in the New Territories of Kowloon, where seven schoolchildren went missing. Seven boys and girls, aged fourteen or fifteen and studying in higher primary school, secretly agreed to leave their families and join the ranks of the Huidongbao People's Liberation Army. One of them was Comrade Liu Min'er, who was only fifteen years old at the time.
　　I met her in April 1949, at a symposium for medical personnel of the Guangdong-Jiangxi-Hunan Border Column. I looked at her with curiosity. She had a red, chubby, and childish face, and her hair was cut short, barely covering half of her ears. She sincerely reflected the difficulties of the company's lack of medicines and equipment, saying, "We are not afraid to wash rotten feet for our comrades, but we don't have pliers or medicine... Now even iodine for first aid is scarce!" Her earnest tone revealed her wholehearted enthusiasm for her work, which left a deep impression on us at that meeting.
　　However, unexpectedly, half a month later, the second time I heard her name was at a memorial service for the heroic martyrs who sacrificed in the battle for the county town of Lufeng. One after another, the soldiers went on stage, affectionately mentioning her name, and mournfully recalling her work performance and the circumstances of her sacrifice. Some said, "Although she was so young, she left her family. In the half-year or so of life in the army, she never complained about any hardship, and was always smiling. People say that the hardest job is being a medic, but she has been a medic for so long without ever frowning!" Some said, "Although she is young and a female comrade, she never asks comrades to take care of her when marching; she carries her own luggage and heavy medicine bag, and never falls behind during rapid marches in the dark!" Some said, "Don't say she is young, she is more responsible than anyone else in taking care of the health of the comrades! Even in the coldest weather, she gets up in the middle of the night to check if the comrades have kicked off their blankets, worried that the comrades will catch a cold!"
　　Everyone unanimously agreed that if Comrade Liu Min'er had not disregarded the danger to rescue the wounded, she would not have sacrificed this time. During this time when the entire battalion charged into the enemy's stronghold in Lufeng City, Liu Min'er walked in the front; as soon as a comrade was injured, she rescued him. After she rescued more than a dozen comrades, when the company began to retreat, the comrades covered her and urged her to leave quickly, but she discovered that there was still one comrade who had not been rescued, so she rushed into the line of fire, regardless of everything, and finally fell under the enemy's intense shooting.
　　At the memorial service, arms were raised like a forest, and everyone was determined to learn from Comrade Liu Min'er, and vowed to avenge Comrade Liu Min'er. The song "Border Column Medic" was composed with her name, and thousands of comrades sang her heroic deeds. Her immortal spirit gave every comrade unlimited encouragement.

### 记刘敏儿同志

　　记刘敏儿同志
    林丹
    一九四八年秋天，九龙新界发生了一件震动整个港九的七学童失踪事件。七个十四、五岁在高小读书的男女孩子，悄悄约齐离开了家庭，投入惠东宝人民解放军的队伍。其中的一个就是刘敏儿同志，当时她只有十五岁。
    我见到她是一九四九年四月，在粤赣湘边纵队医务员座谈会上，我好奇地望着她。她有着红红胖胖充满孩子气的脸孔，头发剪得短短地只遮着半截耳朵。她真挚地反映出连队缺乏药品仪器的困难，说：“我们不怕给同志们洗烂脚，但是没有钳子和药品……现在前线救护用的碘酒也很少了！”她那恳切的语调流露出全心全意为工作的热诚，在那次会议上给我们很深沉的印象。
    但是，想不到半个月后，第二次听到她的名字，却是在纪念陆丰县城战斗牺牲英烈的追悼会上。一个接连一个的战士们走上台去，亲切地提起她的名字，悲愤地追忆着她的工作表现和牺牲时的情形。有的说：“虽然她的年纪那么小，但她却离开家庭。在半年多的部队生活中，任何辛苦她都不哼一句，整天笑嘻嘻地。人家说：最不好做的是卫生员，但她做了这么久的卫生员就没皱过眉头！”有的说：“虽然她年纪小而且是女同志，但她在行军时从不要求同志们照顾她；她自己背着行李和沉重的药袋，黑夜里急行军时也从没掉过队！”有的说：“别说她年纪小，她倒比谁也负责任照顾同志们的健康！就是大冷天，半夜里她也起来巡看同志们有没有踢翻被子，耽心同志们受了凉！”
    大家一致认为，要不是刘敏儿同志不顾危险抢救伤员，这次是不会牺牲的。在这次全营同志冲进陆丰城敌人的据点时，刘敏儿走在前头；一有同志受伤，她便将他救出。当她救出了十几个同志，连队开始撤退的时候，同志们掩护着她，劝她快走，但她发现还有一个同志没有救出，便不顾一切地冲进火线，终于在敌人密集射击下，她倒下了。
    在追悼会上，像树林般的手臂高举，大家决心向刘敏儿同志学习，立志为刘敏儿同志报仇。“边纵医务员”的歌上谱着她的名字，千万同志们唱着她的英勇事迹。她的不朽的精神，给予每个同志无限的鼓励。
