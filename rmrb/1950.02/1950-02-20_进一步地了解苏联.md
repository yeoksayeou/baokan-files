　　Further Understanding of the Soviet Union
　　Ai Siqi
　　In the recent one or two months, the American imperialists and their running dog, the Kuomintang reactionaries, starting with Acheson himself, have frantically mobilized their rumor-mongering machines, spreading the most absurd myths every day, vainly attempting to undermine the friendship between the Chinese and Soviet peoples and to slander the Soviet Union. But now they have been dealt another heavy blow. China and the Soviet Union have signed a new Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance, and Mutual Assistance in Moscow, as well as the Sino-Soviet agreements on the Changchun Railway, Port Arthur, and Dalian, and the Sino-Soviet agreement on providing loans to China. Soon, a Sino-Soviet trade agreement will also be signed. This shatters all the foolish illusions and provocations of the world's reactionaries, and firmly embodies the deep friendship between the Chinese and Soviet peoples and the strong unity of the two great nations in the treaties.

　　Undoubtedly, the newly signed treaties and agreements between China and the Soviet Union are of great benefit to the Chinese and Soviet peoples, as well as to the world's people's goal of striving for lasting peace and universal security. For the people of New China, who have undergone a long and arduous war and are beginning to embark on a difficult path of construction, the new treaties and agreements provide tremendous assistance. Only a socialist country like the Soviet Union, treating the Chinese people with brotherly friendship, can provide us with such unconditional and enormous assistance. Apart from socialist countries, the Chinese people have never received such genuine and great friendship and help from any other country. Chairman Mao said: "Internationally, we belong to the anti-imperialist front headed by the Soviet Union. Genuine friendly assistance can only be sought from this side, and not from the side of the imperialist front." ("On the People's Democratic Dictatorship"). The Chinese Communist Party and the progressive people of China have long drawn a clear line between the Soviet Union, the head of the anti-imperialist forces, and the imperialist countries, and have always deeply believed in the sincere friendship of the Soviet Union. This understanding and conviction of the Chinese Communist Party and the progressive people of China are not produced out of thin air, but are based on the long history of revolutionary struggle. The Soviet Union's friendly assistance to the Chinese revolutionary people did not begin today; the Soviet Union has been continuously providing various forms of assistance to the Chinese people's revolutionary struggle since the first day of its establishment. If some people in China do not have a deep understanding of Chairman Mao's words and do not know enough about the Soviet Union, it is because they have forgotten or simply do not know a large part of the true history of Sino-Soviet friendship under the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang in the past.

　　In order to oppress the Chinese people, the Kuomintang reactionaries used every means to obstruct the friendly connection between the Chinese and Soviet peoples throughout their past rule. The Kuomintang reactionary rulers adopted a despotic policy of obscurantism to suppress and deceive the people's minds. Under the influence of this obscurantist policy, many people were deprived of the right to enjoy the historical and scientific knowledge that modern people should have, making them ignorant of the times, unaware of the truth of the revolutionary history around them for decades, and unaware of what kind of country the Soviet Union actually was. On the contrary, they often reversed right and wrong, mistaking imperialist robbers for friends, while harboring doubts about the Soviet Union, their true friend. The Kuomintang reactionaries used such methods to spiritually sever the friendly connection between many Chinese people and the Soviet Union, in order to weaken the combat strength of the revolution.

　　Now, the reactionary rule of American imperialism and its running dog, the Kuomintang, in China has been overthrown by the Chinese people, and its troops have fled to the islands. However, the remaining forces of reactionary rule have not been completely eliminated, and the influence of its ideological suppression still lingers in some people, especially among some intellectuals in the newly liberated areas. Many people are politically liberated, but not yet completely turned over ideologically. We still need to overthrow this ideological oppression. If we do not overthrow this oppression, American imperialism and the Kuomintang reactionaries will feel that their absurd myths can still find a market, and they will harbor many illusions about their own shameless rumor-mongering and provocations.

　　Fellow compatriots across the country! Arise! Be vigilant against all the remaining forces of the enemy, and thoroughly overthrow the enemy's ideological oppression. Smash all the shameless rumor-mongering, provocations, and absurd myths of American imperialism and the Kuomintang reactionaries! Recognize history, recognize the consistent friendship between the Chinese and Soviet peoples, learn the scientific theories of Marxism-Leninism, learn to draw a clear line between the Soviet state and imperialist countries in principle, "further understand the Soviet Union," further understand Chairman Mao's instruction of "leaning to one side," further strengthen the friendship and unity between the Chinese and Soviet peoples, raise the banner of the new treaties and agreements between China and the Soviet Union, and strive to realize lasting world peace and universal security, and strive to build a strong and industrialized New China!

　　进一步地了解苏联
    艾思奇
    最近一二月来，美帝国主义者和它的走狗国民党反动派，从艾奇逊自己起，发狂似的动员了他们的造谣机器，天天散布着最荒谬的神话，妄想以此来破坏中苏人民的友谊和毁谤苏联。但它现在又吃了当头一棒。中苏两国在莫斯科签订了新的中苏友好同盟互助条约，以及中苏关于长春铁路、旅顺口及大连的协定，中苏关于贷款给中国的协定，而不久还将签订中苏贸易协定，这就粉碎了世界反动派的一切愚蠢的幻想和挑拨，把中苏两国人民的深厚友谊和两个大国家的坚强团结，在条约上巩固地体现出来了。
    毫无疑义，中苏两国间新签定的条约和协定，对于中苏两国人民以及世界人民争取持久和平和普遍安全的目的，是有很大利益的。而对于经过了长期艰苦战争、开始走向困难的建设道路的新中国人民，新的条约和协定更给与了巨大的助力。这样巨大的助力，只有像苏联以兄弟的友谊对待中国人民的社会主义国家，才能无条件的给与我们，除了社会主义国家之外，中国人民是从来没有从其他任何国家得到过这样真实伟大的友谊和帮助的。毛主席说：“我们在国际上是属于以苏联为首的反帝国主义战线一方面的，真正的友谊的援助只能向这一方面去找，而不能向帝国主义战线一方面去找。”（论人民民主专政）。中国共产党和中国进步的人民，早就把反帝国主义的首脑苏联国家和帝国主义国家的界线划得十分清楚，并且从来就对于苏联的真诚友谊深信不疑了。中国共产党和中国进步人民的这种认识和确信，不是凭空产生的，是以长期的革命斗争历史作基础的，苏联对于中国革命人民的友谊援助，并不是从今天才开始，苏联是从她立国的第一天起就不断地对中国人民的革命斗争给与各种各样的援助了。中国人民中如果有人对于毛主席的话领会不深，对苏联认识不够的话，那是由于在过去国民党反动统治下忘记了或简直不知道中苏人民友谊的一大段真实的历史。
    国民党反动派为着压迫中国人民，在它过去统治的整个时期，曾经用一切方面来阻碍中国人民与苏联人民的友谊联系。国民党反动统治者采用了专制主义的愚民政策，来压制和蒙蔽人民的思想，在这愚民政策的影响下，许多人民就被剥夺了享受现代人应有的历史和科学知识的权利，使得他们昧于时势，不知道自己身边几十年来的革命历史的真相，不了解苏联究竟是什么样的国家，相反的是常常是非颠倒，把帝国主义强盗误认做朋友，而对于真正朋友的苏联，却在肚子里藏着疑团。国民党反动派就用这样的方法来从精神上隔断许多中国人民对苏联的友谊联系，以图减弱革命的战斗力量。
    现在，美帝国主义及其走狗国民党在中国的反动统治被中国人民打倒了，它的军队都逃到海岛上去了。但是，反动统治的残余势力还未完全消灭，它的思想压制的影响，却还残留在某些人民中间，特别是新解放地区的一些知识分子中间。许多人在政治上算解放了，在思想上却还没有完全翻身。我们还需要推翻这思想的压迫，不推翻这种压迫，美帝国主义和国民党反动派就会觉得他们的荒谬神话还可能找到市场，就会对于他们自己的无耻的造谣挑拨寄存着许多幻想。
    全国同胞们！起来！警惕一切敌人的残余势力，把敌人在思想上的压迫也彻底推翻了罢。粉碎美帝国主义及国民党反动派的一切无耻的造谣挑拨和荒谬神话！认清历史，认清中苏人民始终不渝的友谊，学习马列主义的科学理论，学习从原则上来划清苏联国家和帝国主义国家的界线，“进一步地了解苏联”；进一步领会毛主席的“一边倒”的指示，进一步加强中苏两国人民的友谊团结，举起中苏两国新的条约和协定的旗帜，为实现世界持久和平与普遍安全而斗争，为建设强盛的工业的新中国而斗争！
