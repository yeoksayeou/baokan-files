　　An Introduction to Yin Jiyu, Branch Secretary of Congjia Village, Jin County
　　Wang Fan
    I. Helmsman of Congjia Village
    I met Yin Jiyu, the Communist Party branch secretary of Congjia Village in Dengshahe District, Jin County, in a meeting of the land redistribution committee of Congjia Village. His face was dark red, and his eyes shone under the dim oil lamp. His young and healthy face revealed the fortitude and wisdom honed in the tense struggle.
    The meeting was in progress, discussing and evaluating the distribution of livestock and farm tools. Yin Jiyu sat among many peasants, listening intently to everyone's speeches. When the discussion turned to the issue of distribution targets, many people advocated that the land redistribution committee should decide. Yin Jiyu said, "...Land reform is a major test. Good people and bad people are revealed here, but it must be evaluated by everyone. If you don't let everyone evaluate, you might shut good people out..." During the discussion, they found the names of some hooligans in the preliminary list of recipients. A member of the evaluation committee said angrily, "People like them, in my opinion, shouldn't get anything, treat them like landlords!..." Immediately, many people agreed. After everyone had spoken, Yin Jiyu said, "Putting these people with the good people can drag them out. They should be educated, not attacked, don't let them get close to the landlords." Someone else said that poor peasant Yang Jide was a "backward element" and should be given less. He explained, "It's not good to think this one is bad, that one is bad, and in the end, only a few party members and cadres are good... Don't underestimate Yang Jide. Although he can't speak eloquently, he can produce. He is a decent person. Why don't we take care of such people?..." In this meeting, I saw how powerful his loud voice was. He persuaded those peasants who were not yet highly conscious, and naturally guided the meeting to a correct conclusion.
    In the meeting, everyone often looked at him with respect, waiting for him to express his attitude.
    Usually, he was so amiable and approachable that people greeted him affectionately as "Branch Secretary". The Young Pioneer on guard duty ran to test him on a new character. He wrote the words "Create a New World" stroke by stroke to test the child. Old peasants were willing to share their worries with him. Therefore, old Yong, a poor peasant with gray hair, made this conclusion about the branch secretary: "Old Yin is truly impeccable. He only cares about us ordinary people."
    Why was Yin Jiyu so loved by the peasants? Because he grew up and worked with the peasants of this village, survived the days of hardship, and grew strong from countless arduous struggles. Old Yin came to this village at the age of twelve (originally from Huajiatun District). His father and uncle rented land from landlord Zhang Yongshan, and even lost their family fortune to the landlord. Old Yin went out to work at the age of fourteen. He had to get up in the middle of the night in the severe winter to pound powder (the vermicelli in the mill was frozen, so he had to hammer the ice down), which caused him to freeze off his toenails; in the autumn, he threshed peanut vines so much that half of his fingernails were worn off, and the pads of his fingers were also worn through. Old Yin endured such days for fourteen years.
    Dalian and Lushun were liberated, and Old Yin, like all the old farmhands in the village, hoped that the times would change. In the autumn of 1947, the rent reduction movement burned like fire to Congjia Village. Old Yin had just been used by Li Xiezi (Li Changchun) for a year for free, and he was full of anger. After listening to the Communist Party's doctrine of leading the peasants to turn over, he made up his mind: "If the Communist Party really leads the poor to turn over, count me in. I am not afraid of these bastards!"
    From that day on, Old Yin became as hard as steel. He found the people in the village who had suffered hardship and secretly held meetings in the woods every night. Everyone complained, mustered their courage, and started on July 16th. He became the leader of the rent reduction movement in the village. He led everyone to overthrow Zhang Yongshan, Yan Baoyu, Yan Baozhu, Li Changchun, Li Fachun, Sun Liantian, Sun Shutian...this group of bloodsuckers. In October, Old Yin and Wang Yongji joined the Communist Party together.
    The rent was reduced, and some poor farmhands also cultivated some "official land". However, due to the lack of education in the movement, some people, recalling this storm, felt fear, did not believe in their own strength, and thought this was not normal. As a result, some poor farmhands retreated. Some hooligans pretending to be activists, such as Li Wenhong and Cong Fushou, went back to the landlords.
    II. Relying Closely on the Masses in Struggle
    The storm had passed, but the battle had not stopped. Although feudal landlords dared not run rampant in the streets, they became venomous snakes in deep holes. In the winter of that year, landlords Yan Baoyu, Yan Baozhu, Sun Liantian, and others, known as the "Four Great Families" of Congjia Village, colluded with special agent Chen Weike for 400,000 yuan, launching a counterattack against Old Yin and all the poor farmhands in the village. Chen Weike took the money, first opened a casino in the village, and it happened to be December. Some hooligans who had previously pretended to be "active" were immediately attracted; some young people who liked to gamble also ran into the casino. Soon, this casino often gathered forty or fifty people. Chen Weike used these people to win over some peasants who were not yet highly conscious, holding meetings every day to discuss overthrowing Old Yin (at that time, Old Yin had been transferred from chairman of the farmers' association to village chief). Chen Weike was a cadre who had been expelled by the district. During the rent reduction in 1947, he had gone to the countryside with a gun and glared when he spoke. Many people were afraid of him, and they dared not refuse when he called them to meetings. He provoked discord, saying: "Old Yin is an outsider, why should he be the village chief? Are there no people in our village?", "You should get five dou of fruit when distributing it, but he only gives you three dou..." After Chen Weike said this, some people were deceived, and slowly distanced themselves from Old Yin. Near the New Year, Chen Weike led a group of hooligans to collect things from house to house, saying it was for the poor to celebrate the New Year. The landlords pretended to be compassionate and took out some things. Chen Weike held a meeting to distribute things to everyone and said: "We are not like Old Yin who only knows how to engage in production, doesn't haul manure and even criticizes..." Some people felt moved: Old Chen is really better than Old Yin. More people went to the meeting; some honest peasants, fearing that the landlords would seize the fruits of the struggle, also echoed.
    Old Yin was still in the dark, still trusting those fake activists, and busy mobilizing production all day long. Once, Yan Baozhu's son deliberately argued with Old Yin. At this time, Chen Weike answered, "Old Yin, I tell you, I am also your enemy, if you can't bring me down today, I will bring you down!" Old Yin shouted angrily, but no one in the room said anything. At this time, Old Yin knew that things were going badly.
    The landlords saw that the time for a counterattack was ripe, and Chen Weike came up with a poisonous plan. They created a fake account book, writing double the amount of fruit distributed to each peasant, and collecting stamps and seals from house to house. The peasants were illiterate, didn't know what was going on, and dared not refuse to stamp. On the thirtieth day of the lunar December, Chen Weike led a large group of peasants, with the fake account book, to the district to accuse Old Yin.
    The district looked at the account book, with black and white letters, Old Yin had embezzled several thousand catties of grain, with witnesses and material evidence. But then they thought, Old Yin is a good comrade praised by everyone, wouldn't do this?! After the New Year, the district sent an old comrade Liu to investigate. Wherever Old Liu went, fake activists Li Wenhong and Cong Fushou followed. The villagers dared not say it wasn't true. Old Liu also went to find the village branch secretary Wang Yuhua (who lived in another village, Congjia Village did not have a party branch at that time). He only said, "Old Yin is wronged!" But he couldn't say why he was wronged for a while. The next day, Old Liu sent Chen Weike with a group of people to Shang Po Che Gou Tun to dig pits and pull mud. Chen Weike worked hard all day to show his activeness. Taking advantage of this opportunity, Old Liu visited party member Yu Wancheng in Xia Po Che Gou Tun (the village with the most poor farmhands), and then he understood the truth. He immediately found fake activists Li Wenhong and Li Shouhong, and confronted them on the spot, making things even clearer. Old Liu held a meeting in Xia Po Che Gou Tun that day, exposing Chen Weike's conspiracy to collude with landlords and win over peasants. The peasants who had been deceived suddenly realized: "So that's what happened!" Old Yin didn't know about this change that day, and Chen Weike didn't know either.
    The next day, Old Yin's family learned that the masses were holding a general meeting to expose Chen Weike's and the four landlords' conspiracy, revealing the truth of the matter, and a "great reversal" had occurred...
    That night, Old Yin couldn't sleep, tossing and turning, thinking, why did such a thing happen? It was because he had separated himself from the honest peasants and was deceived by fake activists into the landlords' trap. From then on, Old Yin realized the principle of relying on poor farmhands and uniting with middle peasants to fight against landlords. After that, Old Yin visited honest peasants every day. These people didn't need to be told, they understood the principle of being exploited, and knew that they were enemies with the landlord class. This came from decades of painful life. After these laboring peasants who had suffered so much rose up, the Communist Party took root, and the branch was established in September 1948. In the spring plowing movement in 1949, the branch united all the peasants closely through party members to carry out production. The branch became the fortress of all work in the village, and Old Yin was elected as the branch secretary.
    The landlords' hearts would not die. One conspiracy was exposed, and then came the second, the third... In early 1948, another landlord group, Zhang Yongshan, Zhang Xiting, etc., planned to kill Old Yin and another ten or so activists. However, because Yin Jiyu and the peasants, who had experienced several battles, had the experience of struggle, they could not act for a long time, and finally exposed the conspiracy...
    III. Overcoming Typhoons and Surviving Disasters
    At the end of July 1949, the fighting Congjia Village welcomed another test. --A typhoon hit Congjia Village. Crops fell, trees fell, houses fell, and even the flagpole of the Leishen Temple fell, but the peasants of Congjia Village did not fall. They stood in the storm. Branch Secretary Old Yin led party members and active members of the farmers' association, holding hands in the neck-deep water, running along the east bank of the river and the west bank of the river. Seeing whose house was in danger, he mobilized them to move to other people's houses and helped to rescue things. No one in the village was killed or injured. Every time poor peasant Li Wenliang recalled the scene that night, he said with gratitude: "If it weren't for the leadership of the Communist Party, I would have been killed when the house collapsed. I couldn't take anything from my house, and if I went in again, I would have been killed!" At night, Old Yin organized sentries, and during the day, he led everyone to do other work. He said that the more people were not in the mood, the more they had to seize the time, otherwise, everyone would easily lose their energy if they were too depressed. After the storm, the earth was covered in water, the corn lay in the water, the leaves were blown away by the wind, and some cobs even sprouted. Looking at the village, the houses were piles and piles of ruins... The peasants all sighed. At this time, Branch Secretary Old Yin didn't lose heart at all. He said to everyone: "Crops can be killed by the wind, but people can't die. We have to live. To live, we have to find a way. It's no use just worrying..." He also said: "Look at whose houses have collapsed, the landlords' houses haven't collapsed. It's all our poor people's small mud houses that have collapsed. These are our own brothers' houses. Let's hurry up and help rebuild them!" Everyone shouted: "Yes, unity is strength." More than 300 members of the farmers' association in the village formed four major groups and twelve subgroups, launching a house-building movement. Those who built bricks built bricks, those who carried mud carried mud, those who lacked stones smashed stones, those who had carts provided carts, those who had people provided people, carpenters repaired the rafters, and everyone helped if there were not enough bricks and tiles. More than a hundred houses were newly built in less than three days. Even now, when people in Congjia Village mention the typhoon, everyone will think of the branch secretary: "Our branch secretary worked for more than twenty days, almost to the point of vomiting blood. In this way, our ordinary people suffered so much less hardship."
    Immediately after the disaster relief work, the branch proposed saving for famine and developing sideline production. Female party members and Youth League members led peasant women to collect wild vegetables in the deep mountains and fields; the branch secretary led peasants to plant autumn crops, buckwheat. Then they went to quarry stones, repair roads, and build bridges to engage in sideline production. They let those who were so poor that they had nothing to eat do more work first, so that everyone's lives were guaranteed, and they have not lost their energy until now. The whole village collected more than 80,000 catties of wild vegetables and cut five or six thousand catties of livestock grass. Sideline production earned a total of more than 2.9 million. Poor peasants Lin Zhenjia and Yu Jikuan bought two donkeys relying on sideline production. Everyone's life had a bottom line, and they were not flustered. They all thought that this was the benefit of the Communist Party's leadership and believed in the Communist Party even more. In the autumn, they were very motivated to return agricultural loans and pay public grain. Pang Fu said: "With the Communist Party, we won't go hungry." The whole village paid all the public grain and agricultural loans in a few days.
    After many battles, Old Yin has become a talented organizational worker. No matter how busy he is, he is never careless or flustered. For example, during last year's autumn harvest, other villages were dizzy with just being busy collecting grain, while Old Yin arranged for grain collection and mobilized autumn plowing. He said: "Autumn plowing has oil and gas, grain collection is important, and plowing is also important." The whole village completed 98% of autumn plowing.
    I participated in land reform work with him for a day or two, and I found that he was an excellent leader. He never confined himself to the circle of affairs, but used his main energy to understand the ideological situation of the masses and carry out education. Almost every night he went to the cultural station to talk to the peasants who were learning to read about the policy of land reform, and then participated in their discussions. I listened to his speeches several times, and I was really surprised. The words were so simple, and the principles were so profound, that almost every sentence was permeated with policy and thought.
    Although his cultural level limited him, making it impossible for him to study theory more conveniently, he had a far-sighted view of problems. He said to me: "After the land reform is completed, organizing mutual aid will be the main task. If mutual aid is not good, production will not be good. The middle peasants still have the idea of being afraid of getting rich. We should tell them that the Communist Party wants us to get rich. In the past, we were poor because we were exploited. We should also tell the poor farmhands not to listen to a few soft words from the landlords and forget the pain of their exploitation. We must supervise them to work hard..." He was very humble and often talked about the help the superior party committee gave him. If you ask him why he has these work achievements, he will say: The superior party gave me ideas, and the masses and I worked together to find solutions. How could I not do well?!

　　金县丛家村支部书记尹吉玉介绍
　　望帆
    一、丛家村的舵手
    在旅大区金县登沙河区丛家村土地处理委员会的会议上，我遇见共产党的村支部书记尹吉玉。他的脸色黑而发红，两眼在昏暗的油灯下闪着光；在他年轻而健康的脸上，流露着在紧张斗争中锻炼出的刚毅和智慧。
    会议正进行评议分配牲口、农具。尹吉玉坐在许多农民中间，出神地倾听大家的发言。讨论到分配对象问题，有不少人主张由土地处理委员会研究决定，尹吉玉说：“……土改是一个大考验，好人坏人都在这里显出来了；可是得交给大家评。你若不叫大家来评，说不定就把好人关在大门外面了，……”讨论时，发现初步提的对象中，有几个二流子的名字，一位评议委员气愤的说：“像他们这样的人，依我看什么也不给，按地主待！…”立刻有不少人表示赞成。尹吉玉同志等他们讲过了就说：“这些人放在好人一堆，就能把他们拖出来。对他们应该是教育，不是打击，不要让他们靠拢到地主一堆去。”又有人说贫农杨吉德是个“落后分子”，应少分给点东西。他又解释道：“不许看这个也不好，那个也不好，弄到最后只剩下几个党员干部好。……你们不要小看杨吉德，他虽然不能说会道，但他能生产，是一个正经人。我们为什么不照顾这样人？……”在这一次会议里我看到了他那宏亮的声音是多么的有力，他说服了那些觉悟还不高的农民，很自然地引导会议作出正确的结论。
    在会议上，大家常常用尊敬的眼光看他，等待他表示态度。
    平常，他是那样的和蔼可亲，人们都亲热的招呼他“支部书记”。站岗的儿童团员，跑来考他一个生字。他也一笔一划的写出“创造新世界”来考这个孩子。老农民见了他，也愿意和他一块扯扯心事。因此头发花白了的贫农老勇，给支部书记作了这样的结论：“老尹那人真是一点说的也没有，他心上就只有咱老百姓。”
    尹吉玉为什么受到农民这样的爱戴呢？因为他是和这个村子的农民一起生长、劳动，从苦难的日子中熬过来的，从无数艰苦的斗争中壮大的。老尹十二岁就来到这个村（原是华家屯区人），父亲和大爷老哥俩租种地主张永山家的地，连家底也赔到地主的腰包里了。老尹十四岁就出去扛活。在严冬的半夜就起来捶粉（粉房的粉条冻了，把冰捶下来），因此冻掉了脚指盖；秋天里光抖擞花生蔓就把手指盖磨掉半截，手指肚也磨透了腔。就这样的日子老尹熬过了十四年。
    旅大解放了，老尹和全村的老雇农一样盼望着年头该换换了。一九四七年秋天，减租运动像火似的烧到丛家村。老尹刚刚被李蝎子（李长春）白白使唤了一年，满肚子火气，听了共产党领导农民翻身的道理以后，把心一横：“共产党若真的领导穷人翻身，我算一个，我不怕这些狗养的！”
    从这一天起，老尹像一块钢一样的硬起来了。他找了村里受过苦的人，天天晚上跑到树林子里偷着开会。大家诉了苦，把气鼓足了，就在七月十六日那一天开火了。他成了该村减租运动的领袖，他领导大家斗倒了张永山、阎宝玉、阎宝珠、李长春、李发春、孙连田、孙书田……这一群吸血鬼。十月里，老尹和王永吉一起参加了共产党。
    租也减了，有些贫雇农还种上了一部分“官地”。但在运动中缺乏教育，有些人回忆起这一场风暴，有的感到畏惧，不相信自己的力量，认为这不是常事。因而一部分贫雇农退缩了。假装积极分子的一些二流子，像李文鸿、丛福寿又跑到地主跟前去了。
    二、在斗争中紧紧依靠群众
    暴风雨过去了，战斗并没有停止。封建地主虽然不敢在大街上横行，但变成了深穴里的毒蛇。当年冬天，地主阎宝玉、阎宝珠、孙连田等这些被称为丛家村“四大家族”的人，用四十万块钱勾结了特务陈维科，向老尹和全村贫雇农反攻。陈维科拿了钱，先在村里开了个赌场，又赶上是个腊月，从前假装“积极”的二流子一下被吸引过去了；有一些好赌的青年也跑进了赌场。不久，这个赌场里经常聚集四五十人。陈维科就通过这些人来拉拢一些觉悟还不高的农民，天天开会商量斗倒老尹（那时老尹已由农会主任调任村长）。陈维科是被区上开除的干部，一九四七年减租时，曾带着枪下过乡，一说话就瞪眼，好多人都怕他，他叫去开会不敢不去。他从中挑拨，他说：“老尹是个外来的，为什么叫他当村长？咱们就没有人了吗？”，“分果实你该分五斗，他就分给你三斗……”经陈维科这样一讲，有些人被骗了，慢慢的和老尹离远了。快过年了，陈维科领导着几个流氓家家收东西，说是给穷人过年。地主们就假装慈悲，拿出一些东西来。陈维科开了个会把东西分给大家，并讲：“咱不像老尹那样光知道搞生产，不拉粪还批评……”有些人心里动了：老陈真比老尹强。去开会的人就更多了；有一部分老实农民，怕地主抢去斗争果实也随声附和着。
    老尹却还睡在鼓里，仍很信任那些假积极分子，自己成天忙着动员生产。有一次，地主阎宝珠的儿子故意和老尹吵起来。这时陈维科就在旁边答了腔：“老尹我告诉你，我和你也是对头，你若今天不能把我整倒，我就得把你整倒！”老尹气的大喊，满屋子农会员却一声不响。这时老尹才知道来势不妙。
    地主们一看反攻的时机已经成熟，就由陈维科想出了一条毒计，他们造了一本假账，把每户农民分得的果实加倍的写上，挨家收戳子盖印。农民都不识字，不知是怎么回事，又不敢不盖。阴历腊月三十，陈维科领着一大队农民，拿着假账，到区上把老尹告了。
    区上一看，账上白纸黑字，老尹贪污了好几千斤粮食，有人证有物证。可是又一想，老尹是人人称赞的好同志，不会这样吧？！过了年，区上就派一位老刘同志下来了解情况。老刘走到那里，假积极分子李文鸿、丛福寿便跟到那里。村里人不敢不说这是真的。老刘又去找了村支部书记王玉华（住外村，丛家村那时没有党的支部），他光说：“老尹屈啊！”到底屈在那里，他一时也说不出道理来。第二天，老刘打发陈维科带着一帮人到上破车沟屯去打坑、拉泥。陈维科为了表现积极，大干了一天。老刘趁这个空，在下破车沟屯（贫雇农最多的屯子）访问了党员于万成，才明白了事情的真相，马上又把假积极分子李文鸿、李寿洪找来，当场对证，事情更加分明。老刘当天就在下破车沟屯开了一个会，揭发了陈维科勾结地主、拉拢农民的阴谋。过去被蒙蔽的农民也恍然大悟：“原来是这么回事！”这一天的变化，老尹还不知道，陈维科也不知道。
    第二天老尹家才知道群众开大会，揭发陈维科和四家地主的阴谋，暴露了事情的真相，来了一个“大反卦”。……
    这天晚上，老尹睡不着，翻来覆去的想，为什么出了这么一场事？就是因为自己脱离了老实农民，误信了假积极分子上了地主的圈套。从此老尹认识了依靠贫雇农，团结中农和地主斗争的道理。这以后老尹就天天访老实农民。这些人不用讲，很懂得受剥削的道理，知道和地主阶级是对头。这是从几十年的痛苦生活中得来的。这些受尽痛苦的劳动农民起来以后，共产党就扎下了根，到一九四八年九月建立了支部。在一九四九年的春耕运动中，支部通过党员紧紧团结了全体农民，进行生产。支部成了全村一切工作的堡垒，老尹被选为支部书记。
    地主们的心是不会死的，一个阴谋被揭穿了，又来了第二个，第三个……。一九四八年初，另一个地主集团张永山、张喜庭等，便计划杀害老尹和另外十来个积极分子。但由于经过了几番战斗的尹吉玉与农民，已有了斗争的经验，使得他们久久不得下手，终于暴露了阴谋。……
    三、战胜台风渡过灾荒
    一九四九年七月末，战斗的丛家村又迎接了一次考验。--台风袭击了丛家村。庄稼倒了，树木倒了，房子倒了，连雷神庙的旗杆也刮倒了，但是丛家村的农民没有倒，他们屹立在暴风雨中。支部书记老尹领着党员和农会的积极会员，在没脖子的大水里，手拉着手，河东沿河西沿的跑。看谁家房子危险就动员他搬到别人房里，帮助抢救东西，全村没死伤一个人。贫农李文良每一回想起当夜的情景，就满怀感激地说：“若不是共产党的领导，房子塌了早就把我打死了，家里东西我一把拿不了，再进去一趟还不就打死了？！”夜里老尹组织放哨，白天还领导大家作别的工作，他说越是在大伙没心思的时候，越得抓紧，否则大伙一发大闷就容易泄劲。暴风雨过后，大地一片水，苞米躺在水里，叶子叫风刮光了，有的棒子还发了芽。看看村里，房子倒得一堆堆的………农民都唉声叹气。这时候支部书记老尹一点不泄气，他对大家讲：“庄稼刮死了，人不能死，要活下去。要活下去，就要想办法，光发愁不行。……”他又说：“你们看看都是谁的房子倒了，地主们的房子没有倒，倒的都是咱们穷人的小泥房，这是咱们亲兄弟的房子，咱们赶快帮助整起来吧！”大伙喊：“对，团结起来力量大。”全村三百多个农会会员组成四大组，十二个小组，展开了盖房运动。垒砖的垒砖，挑泥的挑泥，缺石头去砸石头，有车的出车，有人的出人，椽子坏了有木匠，砖瓦不够大家帮。一百多间房子，不到三天的工夫，都新崭崭的盖好了。直到现在在丛家村一提起刮台风的事，大家都会想起支部书记：“俺支部书记一下干了二十来天，差一点累的吐血。这样，咱老百姓少受了多少困难。”
    紧接着救灾工作之后，支部就提出了节约备荒，开展副业生产。女党员和团员们带领农民妇女，深山遍野去采野菜；支部书记领导农民种秋庄稼，荞麦。紧接着又去打石头，修路，修桥搞副业生产。叫那些家里穷得没有吃的人先干，多干，这样大家生活有了保障，一直到现在也没有泄过劲。全村采了八万多斤野菜，和割了五六千斤牲口草。副业生产一共赚了二百九十多万。贫农林振家和于积宽，靠副业生产就买了两个驴。全村生活都有底了，心不慌了，就都想到这是共产党领导的好处，更加相信共产党了。到秋天，还农贷，缴公粮，他们劲头很高。庞福来说：“有了共产党，咱就饿不着”。全村几天里把公粮和农贷全缴上了。
    经过了多次战斗的锻炼，老尹已经成为一个有才能的组织工作者。不管工作多忙，他从不潦草慌乱。比如去年秋征，别的村光忙征粮就头昏眼花，而老尹一面布置征粮一面还动员秋耕。他说：“秋天耕地有油气，征粮要紧，耕地也要紧。”全村秋耕完成了百分之九十八。
    我和他一起参加过一两天土改工作，我发现他是一个优秀的领导者。他从来不把自己限于事务圈子，而是把主要精力用来了解群众思想情况，并进行教育。几乎每天晚上他都到文化站上去给学习认字的农民们讲讲土改的政策，完了还参加他们的讨论。我听了他几次讲话，真使我吃惊，话是那样通俗，道理又那样深刻，几乎没有一句话不是贯穿着政策思想的。
    虽然文化程度限制了他，使他不能更方便的学习理论，但他看问题眼光放得很远。他对我讲：“土改完了以后，组织互助，就是主要任务。互助不好，生产就搞不好。中农还有怕发财的思想，应该告诉他们共产党愿意咱们发财，从前穷是叫人家剥削的。还应该告诉贫雇农，不要听地主几句软话，就忘了他剥削咱的苦处，必得看管他们好好劳动……”他很虚心，经常谈起上级党委对他的帮助。你若问他为什么会有这些工作成绩，他就说：上级党给我出了主意，群众又和我一起想办法，怎会能作不好呢？！
