　　Post Offices Nationwide Resume Accepting International Airmail

    [This newspaper report] According to news from the Beijing Postal Administration Bureau, post offices in various regions have now resumed accepting international airmail (limited to letters and postcards for the time being). For airmail postage to Asia, an additional 5,400 yuan will be added to the regular postage for every ten grams; for airmail to other continents, an additional 9,000 yuan will be added.

    [Additional News] Mail to the Soviet Union can also be transferred via Europe before the opening of the direct Sino-Soviet air route. A flat rate of 9,000 yuan will be added for every ten grams, regardless of whether it is the Asian or European part of the Soviet Union. All international airmail received will be forwarded via Guangzhou and Hong Kong.
