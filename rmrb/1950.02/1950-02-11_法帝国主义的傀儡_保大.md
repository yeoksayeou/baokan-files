    Bảo Đại—A Puppet of French Imperialism
    In 1926, when Bảo Đại's father, the twelfth Emperor Khải Định of the Nguyễn Dynasty, passed away, Bảo Đại was only fifteen years old. French imperialism then supported him as the thirteenth emperor of the Nguyễn Dynasty of Vietnam. This child emperor was taken to Paris by the French from a young age for training, and only returned to Vietnam in 1932. What Bảo Đại learned in Paris, besides how to be an obedient puppet, was pleasure-seeking and extravagance. In the eyes of Western journalists, he was known as the "Nightclub Emperor."
    In 1941, the French Pétain government surrendered to the Japanese invaders, and Bảo Đại changed masters, becoming a puppet in the Japanese invaders' "Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere."
    In August 1945, the Vietnamese people, under the leadership of Ho Chi Minh, launched the "August Revolution" and established the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. Bảo Đại, intimidated by the strength of the revolutionary forces, had to announce his "abdication."
    However, when he fled to China in 1946, he begged Chiang Kai-shek's bandit gang and Marshall, who was in China at the time, for help. Bảo Đại met with Marshall in Chongqing and gave him a "political view letter," requesting the United States to support him, and in return, he would recognize the economic and cultural rights of the United States and France in Vietnam.
    At the end of 1946, French imperialism launched a full-scale offensive against the Vietnamese people. Due to the unity and heroic resistance of the Vietnamese people, the French colonial rulers were militarily helpless except for seizing a few isolated cities, so they attempted to use Bảo Đại as a puppet again to deceive the Vietnamese people.
    In 1947, under the auspices of French High Commissioner for Vietnam, Émile Bollaert, Bảo Đại convened a group of Vietnamese traitors in Hong Kong to plan the organization of a puppet regime; at the same time, he continued to collude secretly with the Kuomintang bandit gang's T. V. Soong and American imperialists.
    Since then, negotiations between France and Bảo Đại regarding the organization of a puppet regime have been ongoing. Bảo Đại went to Paris several times to bargain with his French masters, demanding more "independence" and "freedom" from France, but France was only willing to give him Tonkin and Annam provinces, so the negotiations were delayed for more than a year.
    The US imperialists, in view of the growing strength of the peaceful and democratic camp, the great victory of the Chinese revolution, and the vigorous rise of the national liberation movement in Asian colonies, were eager to push Bảo Đại forward. In January of last year, the US government openly intervened, putting pressure on the French government to take effective steps to "clarify the situation in Vietnam." Under this US intervention, Bảo Đại and French President Vincent Auriol finally signed the so-called "Franco-Vietnamese Agreement" on March 8. In June, Bảo Đại returned to Vietnam, reappearing on stage and resuming his role as a puppet.
    The main contents of the so-called "Franco-Vietnamese Agreement" are: France recognizes Vietnam's "independence" within the French Union; France will not prevent Cochinchina from joining Vietnam; French troops may move freely in Vietnam, Vietnamese strategic bases should be occupied by France, and Vietnamese troops will be commanded by French troops in wartime; Vietnam may establish diplomatic missions only in a few neighboring countries and the Vatican, and can only send consuls to other countries, and the candidates for consuls must be appointed by the French government; French people have priority in holding positions in Vietnamese civil administration; French people residing in Vietnam are only subject to French law; France reserves the right to establish public or private educational institutions in Vietnam, and French is taught in Vietnamese schools; France can freely invest in Vietnam, and Vietnamese currency should be included in the Franc zone.
    From this agreement alone, it is not difficult for people to see what the so-called "independent state" of Vietnam, which the imperialists are now touting, and Bảo Đại, the king of this "independent state," really are.

### 法帝国主义的傀儡—保大

    法帝国主义的傀儡—保大
    一九二六年，保大的父亲阮氏王朝第十二代启定帝去世时，保大还只有十五岁，法帝国主义就扶他为越南的阮氏王朝第十三代皇帝。这个儿皇帝从小就由法国人带到巴黎受训，到一九三二年时才回越南。保大在巴黎所学的，除了怎样当一个顺从的傀儡之外，就是声、色、犬、马。在欧美记者们口中，他被称为“夜总会皇帝”。
    一九四一年，法国贝当政府向日寇投降，保大换了一个主子，变成日寇“东亚共荣圈”中的一个傀儡。
    一九四五年八月，越南人民在胡志明领导下发动了“八月革命”，建立了越南民主共和国。保大慑于革命力量的强大，不得不宣布“退位”。
    但当他于一九四六年逃到中国时，他就向蒋介石匪帮及当时在华的马歇尔乞怜。保大曾在重庆求见马歇尔，并交给马歇尔一封“政见书”，要求美国扶植他，而他则承认美国及法国在越南的经济上与文化上的权利。
    一九四六年底，法帝国主义对越南人民发动了全面进攻。由于越南人民的团结一致和英勇抗击，法国殖民地统治者除夺了几个孤立的城市外，军事上一筹莫展，于是企图再以保大做傀儡，来欺骗越南人民。
    一九四七年，在法国驻越高级专员波拉埃的主持下，保大在香港召集了一批越南的卖国贼，筹划组织傀儡政权；同时继续和国民党匪帮的宋子文以及美帝国主义者暗中勾结。
    此后法国和保大关于组织傀儡政权的谈判，一直在进行着。保大曾数度赴巴黎，和他的法国主子讨价还价，保大要求法国多给一些“独立”和“自由”，法国却只愿给他东京、安南两省，这样谈判就拖延了一年多的时间。
    美帝国主义鉴于和平民主阵营力量的日益强大，中国革命的伟大胜利及亚洲殖民地民族解放运动的蓬勃高涨，急于要把保大抬出来。去年一月间，美国政府公开出而干涉，对法国政府施以压力，要后者采取有效步骤，以“澄清越南的形势”。在美国这种干与下，保大与法总统阿里奥尔终于三月八日签订了所谓“法越协定”。六月，保大回到越南，粉墨登场，重新扮演的傀儡角色。
    所谓“法越协定”的主要内容是：法国承认越南在法兰西联邦内的“独立”，法国不从事阻止交趾支那加入越南；法国的军队得在越南自由行动，越南战略基地应归法国占用，战时越军由法军指挥；越南除在几个邻近国家及梵蒂冈可设立外交使团外，在其他各国只能派遣领事，而领事人选则须由法政府委派；法国人有在越南民政机关中担任职务的优先权；居住越南的法国人只受法国法律的管辖；法国在越南保留开办公立或私立教育机关的权利，越南学校教授法文；法国在越南可以自由投资，越南的货币应并入法朗区范围内。
    仅仅从这个协定，人们就不难看出，帝国主义者们现在大吹大擂的所谓越南“独立国”和这个“独立国”的国王保大，究竟是个什么东西。
