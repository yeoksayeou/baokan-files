　　Temple Fair Outside Hepingmen Held as Usual

    [Our Newspaper] During the Spring Festival, the temple fair outside Hepingmen in Beijing was held as usual. The locations for setting up stalls have been designated as follows: South Xinhua Street will have stalls selling new and used books, rubbings, calligraphy and paintings; Xiaoshayuan will sell antiques, jade and other miscellaneous goods; and the east side of Changdian will be for children's toys and playthings.
