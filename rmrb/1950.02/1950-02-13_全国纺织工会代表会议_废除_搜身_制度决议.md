　　National Textile Workers' Union Representative Conference
    Resolution on Abolishing the "Body Search" System

   The "body search" (also known as "inspection", "search", "yarn search", "waist search", etc.) system is an extreme insult to the personal dignity of workers by the ruling class of the old society. This system has been basically abolished in state-owned and public-owned factories in various places; however, it still widely exists in private factories. This is a serious violation of the people's government's policy of safeguarding personal freedom. Immediately abolishing the "body search" system has become the urgent call of the masses of textile workers across the country. Facts have proven that after abolishing this old system, the masses of workers have enthusiastically celebrated their liberation, cherished the factory more, and further enhanced their awareness as masters of the country and improved their enthusiasm for production. Any excuse to retain this unreasonable system is essentially an insult to the workers' thinking. Therefore, the representative conference instructs the preparatory committee of the China Textile Workers' Union to take necessary steps to completely abolish the "body search" system, and requires trade union organizations at all levels to educate all textile workers to actively produce, cherish the factory, and consciously abide by labor discipline.

　　全国纺织工会代表会议
    废除“搜身”制度决议
    【新华社北京十二日电】全国纺织工会代表会议于一月十日通过并经二月九日中华全国总工会常务委员会会议批准的“关于废除‘搜身’制度的决议”，全文如下：
    “搜身”（又名“检身”、“抄身”、“抄纱”、“抄腰包”等）制度，是旧社会统治阶级对工人人格上的一种极端侮辱。这一制度现在各地国营、公营工厂中基本上业已废除；但在私营工厂中则至今仍普遍存在。这是严重违犯人民政府保障人身自由政策的行为。立即废除“搜身”制度，已成为全国纺织工人群众的迫切呼声。事实证明，废除这种旧制度后，工人群众都热烈欢庆自己的解放，更加爱护工厂，更加增强了国家主人翁的意识与提高了生产积极性。任何企图保留这种不合理制度的借口，实质上都是侮辱工人的思想。因此，代表会议责成中国纺织工会筹备委员会采取必要步骤，达到完全废除“搜身”制度，并要求各级工会组织教育全体纺织工人积极生产、爱护工厂与自觉地遵守劳动纪律。
