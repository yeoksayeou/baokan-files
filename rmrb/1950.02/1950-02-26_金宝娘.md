　　Genyuan's mother spent five sheng of rice to buy the girl, planning to raise her and make her Genyuan's wife. The family fleeing the famine took the five sheng of rice and left, never to return.
　　(Ten)
　　Genyuan's mother didn't have a daughter, so she treated her future daughter-in-law like her own daughter, feeding her milk and food from a young age, taking care of her every need. She gave her future daughter-in-law the name Cuicui.
　　(Eleven)
　　When Cuicui was fourteen or fifteen years old, she looked like a flower. She was also skilled and clever, capable of doing anything around the house, feeding pigs and raising chickens, truly a good homemaker. Everyone who saw her praised her as the best girl in Quantoutou Village.
　　(Twelve)
　　Once, a young man carrying two jin of meat passed by Genyuan's doorway, and Cuicui happened to be standing at the door. The young man was stunned by Cuicui's beauty. Unexpectedly, a dog came over and snatched the meat from his hand. From then on, Cuicui's good looks became even more famous.

　　翠翠十四五岁时，长得真像一枝花，手又巧，心眼又灵，炕上地下什么都能干，喂猪养鸡，真是一个好过家的。谁见着都夸是全店头村挑头的好闺女。

　　有次一个青年后生提了二斤肉，路过根元门口，正好翠翠在门口站着。那后生看翠翠看呆了，猛不防过来一只狗，把手里提的肉叼走了。从这以后，翠翠长得好更出了名。
