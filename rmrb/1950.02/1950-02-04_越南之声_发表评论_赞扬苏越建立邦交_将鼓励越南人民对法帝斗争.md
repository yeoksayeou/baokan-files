Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 3rd. The Vietnam News Agency, North Vietnam reports: The "Voice of Vietnam" radio station recently published a commentary stating that the Soviet government's decision to establish diplomatic relations with the Democratic Republic of Vietnam is "an expression of the Soviet Union's unwavering policy of supporting the liberation movements of colonial peoples." Within half a month, both New China and the Soviet Union have recognized the Democratic Government of Vietnam, which will greatly encourage the Vietnamese people's current struggle against French imperialism. The radio station pointed out that the Soviet Union's recognition will inevitably exacerbate the confusion caused by the recent recognition by the People's Republic of China for the puppet regime supported by France.

　　“越南之声”发表评论
    赞扬苏越建立邦交
    将鼓励越南人民对法帝斗争
    【新华社北京三日电】越南通讯社北越讯：“越南之声”电台顷发表评论称：苏联政府与越南民主共和国建立外交关系的决定，是“苏联遵守其始终不渝地支持殖民地人民解放运动的政策的表示”。在半个月内，新中国与苏联都承认了越南民主政府，这将大大地鼓励越南人民目前对法帝国主义的斗争。电台指出，苏联的承认，对于法国所支持的傀儡阵营，必将使其因最近中华人民共和国的承认而产生的混乱，更加严重。
