Xinhua News Agency, Dihua, 4th—Commander of the Xinjiang Military Region, Wang Zhen, delivered a report on the guidelines and tasks for the army's production and construction work in Xinjiang at the Provincial Finance and Economics Committee on January 16th. Excerpts from the report are as follows:

    The Overall Task is to Cultivate 600,000 Mu of Land

    (1) Regarding the production and construction work of the Xinjiang Military Region's army in 1950, we propose that the entire military region cultivate a total of 600,000 mu of land (i.e., 40,000 hectares) this year, with a total task of harvesting 500,000 quintals of grain and 18,000 quintals of cotton. The Military Region has already issued production orders, and the entire army must launch a political and ideological mobilization for participation in labor production and construction work, in order to strive for the victorious completion of the great production and construction tasks of 1950. The production committees of each unit should comprehensively analyze the production conditions and preparations for production tools that have been investigated and studied in each garrison, and formulate production plans for each army, division, regiment, and mess unit. Each division and regiment should convene production representative meetings, and each mess unit should hold soldier's congresses to democratically evaluate production plans, etc., in order to conduct in-depth production mobilization and meticulous organization.

    Should Proceed from a Long-Term Production and Construction Perspective

    (2) The Xinjiang People's Liberation Army is responsible for safeguarding the national defense, guarding the entire territory of Xinjiang, eliminating bandits and secret agents, strictly preventing the conspiracies and sabotage of spies and feudal counter-revolutionaries, and strengthening training. These are the glorious tasks of the national defense force. At the same time, it also bears an equally important task, which is production and construction. The participation of our military region's army in production and construction in Xinjiang is of great significance, and these production and construction undertakings will develop rapidly. This is because Xinjiang borders the Soviet Union, Xinjiang has abundant mineral resources, fertile land that can be reclaimed, and natural grasslands and pastures. Under the permanent cooperation between the two great countries of China and the Soviet Union and the great economic and technological assistance of the Soviet Union to China, Xinjiang will surely be built into a modern industrial base. Therefore, the participation of the Xinjiang army in production and construction is not to overcome temporary difficulties, but should proceed from the perspective of long-term production and construction. The entire army must implement a system of leadership responsibility, take the lead and do it personally, not only making plans but also participating in labor; implement economic transparency; and give full play to the enthusiasm and creativity of the masses, democratically formulating plans and evaluating plans; organizing competitions; and then announcing, inspecting, and urging implementation. This means relying on all soldiers to participate in labor, establish public and private affairs, and create wealth for society and the country. Our participation in production and construction is not to compete with the people for food, but on the contrary, to help the people seek food; we must demonstrate the superiority of collective labor and collective economy to the people of Xinjiang; the collectivized economy of the army under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party is rapidly developing towards modern agriculture and industry, and it will play an important role in the entire national economy.

    First of All, Expand Agricultural Production

    (3) The army's engagement in production and construction must first of all expand agricultural production. Xinjiang has excellent water sources available for development, and can turn millions of acres of wasteland into fertile fields. Relying on the principle of military reclamation and on-the-spot food supply, the difficulty of food supply caused by Xinjiang's vast territory and inconvenient transportation can be solved. In order to complete this year's production tasks, we must implement the mass line and democratic methods, mobilize the masses, and not allow anyone to stand outside the production front. We must organize 100,000 to 110,000 laborers to participate in agricultural production, organize 20,000 mules and horses and plowing cattle [and] 10,000 plows. The rest should use manpower and take 60,000 to 70,000 hoes and other tools, the entire army striving to cultivate 40,000 hectares of land in the spring, in order to rely on agricultural production to obtain living materials locally—grain, vegetables, seasonings, oils, fodder, flax, cotton, etc. Those who participate in handicrafts and mining must also ensure self-sufficiency in vegetables.

    Agricultural Production Plan Table

    (4) Agricultural Production Plan Table for the Entire Military Region:

    (A) Agricultural Production Plan Table:

    (A) Cotton cultivation area: 4,000 hectares, producing 60,000 quintals of cotton, including 42,000 quintals of cotton seeds and 18,000 quintals of raw cotton.

    (B) Grain cultivation area: 35,000 hectares; yield: 525,000 quintals. (Note: (1) One hectare produces 15 quintals of grain; (2) Grain includes wheat, millet, corn, and sorghum; (3) Eating grain locally can save the state transportation costs, which are at least twice the price of grain.)

    (C) Vegetable cultivation area: 4,000 hectares, yield: 640,000 quintals. (Note: (1) One hectare produces 160 quintals; (2) Assuming 200,000 people, one person eats one catty of vegetables a day, totaling 73 million catties a year, or 365,000 quintals; another 275,000 quintals are used for feeding pigs and seasonings.)

    The total agricultural production area is 43,000 hectares. In addition, the planned area for autumn wheat sowing this autumn and winter is 10,000 hectares, which is not included in the spring cultivation figures.

    (B) Livestock production plan: Various livestock raised: Pigs: 20,000 before June, 40,000 before October. Sheep: 200,000. Cattle: 20,000. Chickens: 200,000. In places with more water, more attention can be paid to breeding ducks.

    Develop Production Enterprises According to Specific Circumstances

    (5) The army is stationed throughout Xinjiang, and should develop production enterprises according to local conditions. Some areas can grow wheat and sorghum, while others can grow more cotton and rice. The cavalry units have basic knowledge and experience in raising and managing livestock, so they are suitable for managing large-scale animal husbandry. They should build modern pastures and veterinary epidemic prevention stations, select superior Xinjiang breeds, and expand breeding. The Provincial Animal Husbandry Department should provide assistance and guidance to the army's animal husbandry. Regarding the adoption of foreign breeds, it can be started immediately. The cavalry engaged in animal husbandry must also engage in agriculture, self-sufficient in food, vegetables, fodder, and concurrently operate animal husbandry workshops, such as shearing, washing wool, and tanning leather.

    Establish Production Committees at All Levels

    (6) According to Chairman Mao's instructions, establish production committees at all levels. Under the supervision and leadership of the production committees, establish army cooperatives parallel to the command organs at all levels. Take the regiment as the unit to manage the regiment's production funds, production activities, and the handling of production results, sell products, and supply the producers' necessities, such as towels, soap, toothbrushes, etc., so that all commanders and fighters can cooperate to establish family affairs, save their private surplus savings, accumulate capital, expand reproduction, and establish machine farms and factories. Under the leadership of the state trading organs, the cooperatives of the troops stationed in various places should, under the leadership and entrustment of the provincial government's trading organs, help absorb local products from the people and exchange them for daily necessities, so as to promote urban and rural exchanges and prosper the economy. The purpose of recovering local products from the people and supplying the people with necessities is to develop the people's production and improve the people's lives, and to serve the people. Therefore, the procedures and handling fees and transportation costs to be charged for this exchange trade should be stipulated by the Commerce Department's Trade Bureau. All illegal commercial profit-making activities must be strictly prohibited.

    Vigorously Build Water Conservancy

    (7) Developing agricultural production in Xinjiang must vigorously build water conservancy. We must complete water conservancy projects for 100,000 hectares of land within two years. According to water source, land, economy, and transportation conditions, the following water conservancy plan is formulated: (1) Hami 4,000 hectares, (2) Dihua 4,000 hectares, (3) Shawan, Suilai, and Yanji Sea area 20,000 hectares, (4) Yining 10,000 hectares, (5) Yanqi and Kuerle 50,000 hectares, (6) Aksu 4,000 hectares, (7) Hash and Hotan 10,000 hectares. The earthwork, carpentry, and stonework for the construction of water conservancy projects are all contracted by the troops, and the work is carried out under the guidance of engineers, technicians, and skilled workers. In addition to the materials for water conservancy construction that can be solved locally, the industrial products required will be solved by the Provincial Finance and Economics Committee. The Water Conservancy Department should work with all its strength to complete this water conservancy project plan.

    Designate Reclamation Areas for Each Unit

    (8) Designate reclamation areas for each unit. First, use tents and yurts to simply build underground bungalows as places to "avoid wind and rain," but at the same time, there must be long-term plans, and more complete military reclamation farms should be built step by step in a planned manner, preparing to gradually build them up in two or three years. After such a plan is formulated, it should be discussed and evaluated democratically by the masses, and a construction committee should be elected to direct and supervise its implementation.

    (9) In Xinjiang, the primary problem is to obtain living materials, such as grain, vegetables, meat, and oil. Therefore, it is necessary to develop agriculture, animal husbandry, handicrafts, fishing and hunting, raising poultry, and developing sideline occupations such as sericulture and mulberry planting. Only on the basis of obtaining living materials such as agricultural and animal products can the transition to industrial construction be smooth and economical.

    Under the leadership of Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu, the Chinese Communists and the People's Liberation Army have demonstrated the dauntless heroism of defeating well-equipped domestic and foreign enemies, and also have the strong perseverance to overcome difficulties, and the labor tradition of self-reliance in production. Our production and construction work has many difficulties, and we know that "everything is difficult at the beginning," but the vast majority of comrades are confident that they will also win battles on the labor front of peaceful construction. We can rely on our own labor, rely on all officers and soldiers to use their hands and feet to cultivate land, obtain living materials to improve the lives of officers and soldiers, enhance physical health, and rely on production to overcome financial difficulties and reduce the burden on the state and the people; we must develop agricultural production to lay a solid foundation for building an industrialized Xinjiang, and we rely on labor to build the motherland, and rely on labor to get rich and establish families for officers and soldiers. Our 1950 major production and construction plan can only succeed and not fail, can only exceed and not reduce, and we must strive to successfully complete and exceed the 1950 production and construction plan.

　　关于新疆军队生产建设工作的方针与任务
    新疆军区王震司令员报告摘要
    【新华社迪化四日电】新疆军区王震司令员于一月十六日在省财经委员会上作了关于新疆军队生产建设工作的方针与任务的报告，报告摘要如下：
    总的任务是种地六十万亩
    （一）关于一九五○年新疆军区军队的生产建设工作，我们提出今年全军区部队种地六十万亩（即四万公顷），收获五十万公担粮食和一万八千公担棉花的总任务。军区已经颁布生产命令，全军为争取一九五○年伟大的生产建设任务的胜利完成，必须展开部队参加劳动生产建设工作的政治上的、思想上的动员。各部队生产委员会应将在各驻地所调查研究的生产条件和准备生产工具的情况，加以综合分析，订出各军师团与各伙食单位的生产计划；各师团应召开生产代表会议，各伙食单位则开军人大会，民主评判生产计划等，深入进行生产动员和周密组织。
    应从长期生产建设观点出发
    （二）新疆人民解放军负有守卫祖国国防，警卫新疆全境，肃清土匪特务，严防奸谍和封建反革命分子的阴谋破坏，加强训练等项任务。这是国防军的光荣任务。与此同时，还负担一项同样重大的任务，这就是生产建设。本军区军队参加新疆生产建设具有重大意义，而且这些生产建设事业是会很快发展起来的。这是由于新疆与苏联接壤，新疆有蕴藏着的丰富矿产，有可垦耕的肥沃土地，有天然的草原牧场，在中苏两个伟大国家永久合作和苏联对于中国经济技术的伟大援助之下，新疆必将建设成为一个现代化的工业基地。因此新疆军队参加生产建设不是为了临时克服困难，而应该从长期生产建设的观点出发。全军要实行首长负责，亲自动手，不仅动手作计划，并且要动手劳动，要实行经济公开，要高度发挥群众的积极性和创造性，民主制定计划及评判计划，组织竞赛，然后公布检查和督促执行。这就是要依靠全体军人参加劳动，建立公私家务，创造社会和国家的财富。我们参加生产建设，不是与民争食，相反地要助民求食；我们要以集体劳动、集体经济的优越性，示范于新疆人民；在中国共产党领导下的军队集体化的经济，是迅速向近代的农业和工业发展的，它将会在整个国民经济中起重要作用。
    首先要扩展农业生产
    （三）军队从事生产建设首先一定要扩展农业生产。新疆有优良的水源可供开发，可把千百万亩荒野变为肥田，依靠军垦农业、就地取食的方针，可使新疆地域辽阔、交通运输不便所造成的粮食供应的困难得到解决。为着完成今年的生产任务，我们必须实行群众路线与民主方法，发动群众，不许任何一个人站在生产战线之外。我们要组织十万至十一万劳动力参加农业生产，组织两万匹骡马和耕牛索引一万耕犁，其余均用人力拿六、七万砍土镘及其他工具，全军争取春季耕种四万公顷土地，以便依靠农业生产，就地取得生活资料——粮食、蔬菜、调料、油类、晶草、亚麻、棉花等等。其他参加手工业矿生产者，也必须保证菜蔬自给。
    农业生产计划表
    （四）全军区部队农业生产计划表：
    （甲）农业生产计划表：
    （Ａ）棉花耕植面积四千公顷，产棉六万公担，其中产棉籽四万二千公担，产净花一万八千公担。
    （Ｂ）粮食耕植面积三万五千公顷；产量五十二万五千公担。（备考：（一）一公顷产粮十五公担，（二）粮食为麦子、小米、玉米、高粱，（三）就地吃粮可节省国家运输费最低限度亦达粮价的一倍。）
    （Ｃ）菜蔬耕植面积四千公顷，产量六十四万公担。（备考：（一）一公顷产一百六十公担，（二）以二十万人计，一人一天一斤菜，一年计七千三百万斤，合三十六万五千公担；另外供喂猪调料二十七万五千公担。）
    农业生产总面积四万三千公顷，此外预备今秋冬麦播种面积一万公顷，不在春耕数内。
    （乙）牧畜业生产的计划：饲养的各种家畜：猪：六月前二万口，十月前四万口。羊：二十万只。牛：二万头。鸡：二十万只。多水的地方可多注意繁殖鸭。
    根据具体情形发展生产事业
    （五）军队驻在全疆各地，要根据各地情形发展生产事业，有些地区可以种小麦、高粱，有些地区可以多种棉花、稻米。骑兵部队对于饲养和管理牧畜是有基本知识和经验的，所以他们适宜经营大畜牧业。他们要建设近代牧场及兽医防疫站，挑选新疆较优良品种，扩大繁殖。省府畜牧厅对于部队牧畜业应予以帮助和指导。关于采用外国品种，可立即开始进行。骑兵经营畜牧业必须兼营农业，自给食粮、蔬菜、草料和兼营牧畜业的作场，如剪毛、洗毛、染皮等。
  建立各级生产委员会
    （六）根据毛主席的指示，建立各级生产委员会。在生产委员会监督和领导下，成立与各级指挥机关平行的军人合作社，以团为单位掌管该团生产资金、生产活动和生产结果的处理，销售产品，供给生产者的必需品，如毛巾、肥皂、牙刷等，使全体指战员能合作起来建立家务，使大家的私有剩余储蓄起来，积累资本，扩大再生产，兴办机器农场和工厂。在国家贸易机关的领导下，驻扎在各地部队的合作社应该在省政府贸易机关领导和委托下，帮助吸收民间土产，换回日用必需品，以促成城乡内外交流，繁荣经济。收回民间土产，供给人民必需品，目的是为发展人民的生产，改善人民生活，为人民服务，因此此项交换贸易应由商业厅贸易局规定章程及应取之手续费与运输费。必须严禁一切非法的商业牟利活动。
    大力兴修水利
    （七）发展新疆农业生产必须以大力兴修水利，我们要在两年内完成十万公顷土地的水利工程。根据水源、土地、经济、交通条件，拟定水利计划如下：（１）哈密四千公顷，（２）迪化四千公顷，（３）沙湾、绥来、延集海地区二万公顷，（４）伊宁一万公顷，（５）焉耆、库尔勒五万公顷，（６）阿克苏四千公顷，（７）哈什、和阗一万公顷。关于修建水利工程的土工、木工、石工，均由部队承包，在工程师、技师、熟练工人指导下进行工作。水利建筑材料除就地能解决者外，所需工业品统由省府财经委员会设法解决。水利厅应以全力为完成这一水利工程计划而工作。
    指定各部屯垦区
    （八）指定各部屯垦区。首先用帐棚、蒙古包简筑地下平房，以作“聊避风雨”的住处，但同时须有长远打算，应有计划地逐步建筑较完善的军垦农庄，准备在两三年内逐渐建设起来。这样的计划拟出后，应该通过群众的民主讨论与评判，并选举建筑委员会指挥监视实施。
    （九）在新疆首要的问题是取得生活资料，如粮食、菜蔬、肉食、油类之供给，因此要发展农业、畜牧业、手工业、渔猎业、喂养家禽、养蚕植桑等副业，只有在获得农牧等产品的生活资料的基础上，才可能顺利地和经济地转入工业建设。
    中国共产党人和人民解放军在毛主席和朱总司令的领导下，表现了战胜武装齐全的国内外敌人的大无畏的英勇精神，而且具有克服困难的坚强毅力，自己动手生产自给的劳动传统。我们的生产建设工作是有许多困难的，我们知道“万事开头难”，但是绝大多数的同志们确信自己在和平建设的劳动战线也一定要打胜仗。我们可依靠自己劳动，依靠全体官兵动手动脚开垦土地，取得生活资料来改善官兵生活，增强体质健康，依靠生产克服财政困难，减轻国家和人民的负担；我们要发展农业生产为建设工业化的新疆打下有力的基础，我们并依靠劳动来建设祖国，依靠劳动致富为官兵成家立室。我们一九五零年大生产建设计划只能成功不许失败，只能超过不许减少，我们要为胜利完成和超过一九五零年生产建设计划而奋斗。
