　　Balancing the Burden, Preventing Speculation
    City Areas Levy Grain Transaction Tax
    [Beijing News] Since the Beijing Municipal Government Tax Bureau universally implemented the grain transaction tax in urban areas on January 6th, the transaction tax revenue for January has increased to over 1,026,000 catties, a 2.2-fold increase compared to December of last year, exceeding the original plan by 14 percent. In the suburban areas of Beijing, transaction taxes on livestock, grain, native cloth, and cotton have been levied since April 15th of last year, while the city had not been collecting transaction taxes, which easily led to the backflow of grain out of the city and tax evasion by speculative merchants taking advantage of loopholes. Therefore, the Municipal Government Tax Bureau began levying livestock transaction tax in urban areas on October 15th of last year, and universally implemented the grain transaction tax in the city starting from January 6th of this year. The feedback after the implementation has been very positive. For example, grain shop owners outside Xizhimen said: With the implementation of transaction tax in the city, it is the same inside and outside the city, the burden is balanced, the procedures are uniform, and business is easier to conduct! The collection of grain transaction tax in Beijing has also played a considerable role in the management of the grain market. However, this tax is not levied on those who purchase for their own consumption, but in practice, it is difficult to distinguish whether small-amount grain buyers are for their own consumption or for profit. In addition, there are few tax collection cadres in the market, and merchants often have to wait a long time to pay taxes. These problems still need to be resolved.

　　平衡负担·防止投机
    城区开征粮食交易税
    【北京讯】京市人民政府税务局自一月六日普遍开征城区粮食交易税以来，使一月份交易税收入已增至一百零二万六千余斤，较去年十二月份增加二点二倍，超过了原定计划的百分之十四。京市郊区牲畜、粮食、土布、棉花交易税早在去年四月十五日便已开征，而城内却一直没有征收交易税，这就容易发生粮食倒流出城及投机商人钻空子漏税等现象。为此，市府税务局乃于去年十月十五日在城区开征牲畜交易税，并于今年一月六日起在城内普遍开征粮食交易税。开征后，反映很好，如西直门外的粮店业表示：城里开征交易税，城内外一样，负担平衡，手续划一，买卖就更好作了！京市粮食交易税的征收工作，对粮食市场的管理也起了相当作用。但该税对自购自食者并不征收，但实际上小额买粮者是自食还是营利，难于辨认；另外，市场收税干部少，商人因上税往往等的很久，这些问题，还须解决。
