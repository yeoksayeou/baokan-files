　　Sino-Soviet Scientific Exchange

　　"Learning from advanced Soviet science" has become the most widely circulated slogan among Chinese scientists today. Even before the birth of the People's Republic of China—in July 1949—China's natural scientists, inspired by the glorious victory of the Chinese People's Revolution, convened the preparatory meeting of the All-China Natural Science Workers Representative Conference in Beijing with unparalleled excitement. More than two hundred outstanding scientists from all over China raised the slogan "Learn from the Soviet Union" at this meeting. In the first issue of their official journal, "Science Communication," a detailed introduction to the "Soviet Academy of Sciences" was also provided. Following the unfolding of the military victories of the Chinese People's Liberation Revolution, this conference quickly established its branches in major cities across China. If we were to examine the meeting records or publications of these branches, we would see that they almost unanimously overflowed with enthusiasm for "Learning from the Soviet Union."
　　At the time of the founding of the People's Republic of China, the Soviet cultural, artistic, and scientific delegation, headed by the outstanding Soviet writer Alexander Fadeyev, visited the people's capital, Beijing, and other cities such as Shanghai and Nanjing. Wherever they went, Chinese scientists welcomed these guests from afar with brotherly warmth. In forums and lectures, scientists from China and the Soviet Union directly exchanged experiences in scientific research. In September 1949, the 100th anniversary of the birth of the great Soviet physiologist Ivan Pavlov was commemorated. In addition to holding grand mass rallies in major cities such as Beijing and Shanghai, we also sent our own experts in physiology, psychology, and medicine to Moscow to personally attend the commemorations. After returning to China, they conveyed the situation of Soviet scientific development witnessed in the Soviet Union and the sincere concern of the Soviet people for the cause of the Chinese People's Revolution to various regions. Through this kind of contact, scientists from China and the Soviet Union not only established close emotional ties but also opened up channels for exchanging scientific knowledge and experience in the future.
　　The enthusiasm of Chinese scientists for "learning from the Soviet Union" is understandable. This is just as understandable as the fervent support of Chinese scientists for our people's democratic regime today. Chinese scientists have come to recognize the characteristic of the people's government respecting science from their own painful experiences after suffering long-term neglect, destruction, and persecution under the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang. Therefore, Chinese scientists today, having long been influenced by the science of the British and American bourgeoisie, have realized the deterioration and decline of scientific work in capitalist countries and felt disappointed, thus recognizing the progressive essence of Soviet science.
　　It is undeniable that modern Chinese science and technology initially developed through learning from Western countries. When imperialists invaded China, scientific and technological knowledge came to China along with the invaders' ships and cannons. The Chinese people began to understand the face of modern science and technology with such a painful feeling. At that time, they still harbored a naive hope that once they learned the imperialists' set of science and technology, they could escape the invaders' ferocity. However, their naive hope was ultimately dashed. Because the imperialists' aggression ruthlessly destroyed all possibilities for China's social development, unless the imperialist forces of aggression were swept away, Chinese society would forever stagnate in a backward stage and be unable to move forward. Naturally, hoping to develop scientific work in a backward society will lead to painful disappointment. Chinese scientists, while suffering from the various disasters brought about by imperialist aggression, also saw how so-called scientific work in capitalist countries was deteriorating and declining day by day. For example, medical scientists conduct research in medical and health fields every day, but in the United States, 12 million people cannot receive any modern medical care at all; despite the hard work of agricultural scientists in researching scientific methods for breeding and increasing production, millions of tons of wheat are dumped into the sea from farms, while millions of people are suffering the torment of hunger; in factories, the results of scientists' research only help capitalists to more cruelly exploit the working people, and any research that cannot increase capitalists' profits is neglected, even if it is most valuable in academic terms, so that many scientists' painstakingly created research reports are bought up by capitalists at high prices and permanently locked in safes. This made Chinese scientists suddenly realize that scientific work in capitalist society has no future. This is what makes them place ardent hope in the most progressive Soviet scientific work. After the birth of the People's Republic of China, China entered the great family of advanced culture. Chinese scientists have also seen the rapid development and brilliant achievements of scientific research under the Soviet regime. This made their enthusiasm for "learning from the Soviet Union" uncontrollable. The Chinese Academy of Sciences is planning to send a large number of scientists to the Soviet Union for observation, which not only satisfies the long-standing aspirations of Chinese scientists but also translates their enthusiasm for "learning from the Soviet Union" into action.

　　中苏科学交流
    丁瓒
    “向先进的苏联科学学习”，这在今天中国科学工作者们中，已经成为一个流传得最广泛的口号了。还在中华人民共和国诞生以前——一九四九年七月——我国的自然科学工作者们就为中国人民革命的辉煌胜利所鼓舞着，而以无比兴奋的心情，在北京召开了中华全国自然科学工作者代表大会筹备会。二百多来自我国各地的优秀的科学家们，就在这个会上提出了“向苏联学习”的口号。在他们的机关刊物《科学通讯》第一期上，也就很详细的介绍了《苏联科学院》。也就是这个会，随着中国人民解放革命军事胜利的开展，很迅速的在我国各大城市先后的成立了它的支会。我们要是翻阅一下那些支会的会议纪录或支会会刊时，也便可以看出他们几乎是一致的洋溢着“学习苏联”的热情的。
    中华人民共和国诞生的时候，以苏联最优秀的作家法捷耶夫先生为首的苏联文化艺术科学工作者代表团，访问了人民首都北京和上海南京等都市。他们每到一个地方，中国科学工作者们都以兄弟般的热忱来欢迎这些来自远方的客人们。在座谈会、演讲会上，中苏两国的科学工作者们直接的交换了双方在科学研究工作上的经验。一九四九年九月，苏联已故伟大生理学家巴夫洛夫诞生一百周年。我们除在北京、上海等大都市分别的举行了盛大的群众性的纪念会而外，并且派了我们自己的生理学、心理学和医学的专家们到莫斯科去亲自参加纪念会。他们回国以后，又在各地传达了他们在苏联所目睹的苏维埃科学发展的情况，和苏维埃人民对于中国人民革命事业的由衷的关怀。就在这种接触之中，中苏两国的科学工作者们不仅在感情上建立了密切的联系，并且开辟了今后交流科学智识和经验的途径。
    中国科学工作者们“学习苏联”的这种热情是可以理解的。这正如今天中国科学工作者们对于我国人民民主政权这末热烈的拥护是一样的可以理解的。中国的科学家们是因为身受了国民党反动统治长期的忽视、摧残和迫害以后，才从自身的痛苦经验中认清了今天人民政权尊重科学的特质的。所以今天中国科学工作者们也正因为曾经长期的在英美资产阶级的科学的影响之下，从看透了科学工作在资本主义国度内的变质和衰落，而感到失望，才认识了苏维埃科学的进步的本质的。
    无庸讳言的，中国近代科学技术，最初是由于向西方国家学习而发展起来的。当帝国主义者侵略中国的时候，科学技术的智识也随着侵略者的舰艇和炮弹来到中国了。中国人民是在那末痛苦的心情中，被迫的来开始了解近代科学技术的面目的。那时他们还怀着一种天真的希望，希望一旦学会了帝国主义者的一套科学技术而后便可逃避侵略者的凶焰了。但是，他们那种天真的希望是终于落空了。因为帝国主义者的侵略是那末无情的摧毁了中国社会发展的一切可能，以致除了扫荡了帝国主义的侵略势力，中国社会是会永远停滞在落后的阶段中而无法向前迈进一步的。要希望在一个落后的社会中来发展科学工作，那自然会遇到惨痛的失望了。中国的科学家们，一面在身受着帝国主义侵略所带来的种种灾难，一面又看到所谓科学工作在资本主义的国家内却是如何一天一天的在变质，在衰落。例如医学科学家天天在作医疗卫生学方面的研究，可是就在美国，却有一千二百万的人民根本受不到一点近代医药的照顾；尽管农业科学家们是如何辛勤的在研究育种增产的科学方法，但是，千万吨的小麦，却由农场被抛到海里，而让千万的人民在忍受饥饿的磨折；在工厂里，科学家的研究成果只帮助了资本家更残酷的来剥削劳动人民，不能使资本家增加利润的任何研究，即使在学术上是最有价值的也遭受到冷落，以致许多科学家心血结晶的研究报告，却被资本家用高价搜去而被永远封锁在保险箱里。这才使中国科学工作者们顿然觉悟，科学工作在资本主义的社会中是不会有任何前途的。这也才使他们对于人类最进步的苏联的科学工作，寄予热烈的希望。中华人民共和国诞生而后，中国走进了高度文化的大家庭里。中国的科学工作者们又看到了苏维埃政权下科学研究的飞跃发展和辉煌成就。这就使他们“学习苏联”的热情一发而不可遏止了。中国科学院正计划着派遣大批科学家赴苏联考察，这不仅是满足了中国科学工作者蕴藏已久的热望，并且使他们的“学习苏联”的热情表现为行动了。
