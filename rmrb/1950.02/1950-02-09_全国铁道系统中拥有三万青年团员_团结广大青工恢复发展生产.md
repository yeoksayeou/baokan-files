　　Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, February 8th: The New Democratic Youth League has nearly 30,000 members in the national railway system. The National Railway Work Committee of the Youth League was officially established in June last year. At that time, there were approximately 7,500 Youth League members in the national railway system, with the largest number, about 6,000, distributed in the Northeast, followed by Tianjin, Jinan, Shijiazhuang and other places. Only the Northeast and Tianjin Railway Bureaus had established Youth League leadership organizations. Since the establishment of the National Railway Work Committee of the Youth League, under the leadership of the Railway Party Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, local Party committees, and the Central Committee of the Youth League, and with the assistance of local Youth League committees, in the past six months, all but the Hengyang Bureau have established Youth League work committees in eleven administrative bureaus and twenty-nine branch Youth League committees. As of the end of last year, according to incomplete statistics, there were 29,185 Youth League members nationwide, an increase of approximately four times compared to the number when the National Railway Work Committee of the Youth League was established, accounting for 24.7% of the total number of young railway workers, which is 116,921.
  Corrected the Tendency of Closed-Doorism
    In the early stage of the Youth League's establishment, there was a relatively serious tendency of closed-doorism in the railway Youth League. On the one hand, they did not dare to boldly develop Youth League members, and on the other hand, they ignored production tasks and even became divorced from production work. In August last year, the National Railway Work Committee of the Youth League, in response to this situation, proposed that the basic tasks of the railway Youth League were production and learning, and that the work of the Youth League must meet the requirements of the broad masses of young workers from production and learning work, and unite the broad masses of young workers to actively engage in the cause of restoring and developing production; and pointed out that the direction of the Youth League's development was to absorb a large number of progressive young workers into the League according to the spirit of the Youth League Constitution. At the same time, the Work Committee also organized work teams to go to the Northeast, Tianjin, Jinan and other places to help local Youth League organizations develop members. Over the past four months, the tendency of closed-doorism in the work of establishing the Youth League has been basically overcome. For example, the Northeast Railway Bureau Youth League, combined with the "Iron Ox Movement," developed a large number of young workers into the League. The number of Youth League members increased from more than 6,000 in June to more than 20,900, accounting for 34.4% of the young workers in the Northeast Railway. For example, 39 of the 55 "Iron Ox Team members" in the Mudanjiang Branch were Youth League members, accounting for more than 70%.
  Achieved Results by Combining Work and Production
    The work of the Youth League in various places has also achieved some results in combining with production. In the early stage of restoring production, the Youth League called on its members to play an exemplary leading role in labor attitude, uniting the broad masses of young and old workers to actively participate in rush repairs, resumption of work, military transportation, voluntary labor, and production competitions. For example, the Youth League members of railway machinery factories or locomotive sections in Xuzhou, Jinan, Qingdao and other places united young workers and adult workers to repair trains in their spare time, and achieved good results. The Youth League also called on its members to take the lead in learning new production methods and systems. For example, in the work of promoting the "responsibility system" and "rationalization proposals," Youth League members, young workers, and activists among the workers often took the lead. In the "Iron Ox Movement," 20 of the 32 Youth League members in the Northeast Linkou Locomotive Section became "Iron Ox Team members." In addition, the Youth League has become an active leader in workers' political, cultural, and cultural and recreational activities. In particular, the Youth League has played a significant role in the technical learning of young workers. For example, the Northeast Railway Youth League generally carried out the "Respect Teachers and Love Apprentices" movement, and specifically signed "master-apprentice contracts." Over the past six months, it has trained a large number of technical talents in railway engineering. Taking the Harbin Railway Factory Vehicle Plant as an example, 38 apprentices signed "master-apprentice contracts." After three months of study, 36 of them passed the examination and were promoted to journeymen.
    The reason why the Youth League's work has achieved the above results is mainly because in the process of work, it has received the leadership of the Party and the support of the administration, and under the unified call and plan of the trade union, it has closely cooperated with adult and older workers, so that the work can be carried out smoothly.

　　全国铁道系统中拥有三万青年团员
    团结广大青工恢复发展生产
    【新华社北京八日电】新民主主义青年团在全国铁路系统中已拥有将近三万团员。青年团全国铁道工作委员会系于去年六月正式成立，当时全国铁路系统共有团员约七千五百人，其中分布在东北的最多，约六千名，其次为平津、济南、石家庄等地。建立了团的领导机构的只有东北与平津路局。自青年团全国铁道工作委员会成立以后，在中国共产党铁路党委、各地党委和团中央的领导下以及各地团委的协助下，半年来，全国除衡阳局外，已建立了十一个管理局的团工作委员会和二十九个分团委。截至去年年底止，据不完全统计，全国团员已有二万九千一百八十五人，比建立青年团全国铁道工作委员会时的数字增加约四倍，占铁路青年工人总数十一万六千九百二十一名的百分之二十四点七。
  纠正了关门主义偏向
    在建团初期，铁路青年团曾发生比较严重的关门主义的偏向，一方面不敢放手发展团员，另一方面则忽视生产任务，甚至与生产工作脱节。去年八月，青年团全国铁路工作委员会针对这种情况，提出铁道青年团的基本任务是生产和学习，团的工作必须从生产和学习工作中满足广大青年工人的要求，团结广大青年工人积极地从事恢复与发展生产事业；并指出团的发展方向是根据团章精神，大量吸收进步的青年工人入团。同时工作委员会还组织了工作团分赴东北、平津、济南等地，帮助各地团的组织发展团员。四个月来，建团工作的关门主义的偏向基本上已经克服。如东北铁路局青年团，结合了“铁牛运动”，发展大批青年工人入团，团员人数由六月份的六千余名增加到二万零九百余名，占东北铁路青年工人的百分之三十四点四。如牡丹江分局五十五名“铁牛队员”中有三十九名是团员，占百分之七十以上。
  工作与生产结合获得成绩
    各地青年团的工作在与生产相结合方面也获得一些成绩。在恢复生产初期，青年团号召团员在劳动态度方面起了模范带头的作用，团结广大青年和老年工人积极参加抢修、复工、军运、义务劳动、生产竞赛等工作。如徐州、济南、青岛等地铁路机厂或机务段的青年团员团结青年工人和成年工人在工余时间修复列车，都获得了很好的成绩。青年团也号召团员在学习新的生产方法和制度方面起带头的作用，如在推行“负责制”与“合理化建议”等工作，常常是团员、青年工人与工人中的积极分子带头。在“铁牛运动”中，东北林口机务段三十二名团员有二十人成为“铁牛队员”。此外，青年团在工人学习政治、文化和文化娱乐活动各方面，都成为积极的领导者。特别是在青年工人的技术学习中，青年团起了很大的作用。如东北铁路青年团普遍进行“尊师爱徒”运动，有重点地订立了“师徒合同”，半年来培养了不少铁路工程方面的技术人材。以哈尔滨铁路工厂车辆厂为例，有三十八个学徒工订立“师徒合同”，经过三个月的学习，其中三十六个经考试合格，升为帮工匠。
    青年团的工作所以获得以上的成绩，主要原因是由于在工作过程中，得到党的领导和行政上的支持，并在工会的统一号召计划下，密切地与成年和老年工人合作，使工作得以顺利进行。
