Xinhua News Agency, Dihua, February 25th: The production movement of the Xinjiang Military Region troops is about to fully unfold. Production preparations for the troops stationed in the Aksu area of Southern Xinjiang are nearing completion and are scheduled to commence large-scale production on March 1st. A certain unit in the Yanqi area collected a large quantity of scrap iron, which was used by soldiers with ironworking experience to rush-produce agricultural implements. Within half a month, they completed half of the tools needed by the unit. A certain unit stationed in Kashgar has surveyed more than 53,000 mu of land in Kashgar, Shache, and Bachu areas. All units have accumulated more than 760,000 jin of fertilizer and manufactured more than 15,000 various types of agricultural implements. During the Spring Festival, a certain regiment of this unit held a full regiment "Production Preparation Grand Review," exhibiting their various agricultural implements and proposing methods for improving those that did not meet standards. A certain independent regiment has departed for the Ashan area to mine gold. A certain unit has built irrigation canals and fish channels at Bosteng Lake, which is rich in fine-scaled fish, and is building a factory in Yanqi to manufacture fishing boats; fishing can begin after the flood season. This unit has also completed the survey work for the Hamagou Coal Mine and decided to add three more coal shafts, which can supply all the fuel for the troops in Yanqi, Korla, and other places. The troops stationed in Dihua City began construction of the Peace Canal in early February. The canal is 17 kilometers long and can irrigate more than 100,000 mu of land. During the Kuomintang rule, construction began in March 1947, but despite the huge expenditure, it was not completed. After a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army took on this arduous task, the commanders and fighters launched a competition, deciding to transport all 7,000 cubic meters (approximately 11,200 tons) of stone slabs needed for construction from a place 26 kilometers away before the end of March. The entire army enthusiastically launched a stone-pulling movement, with everyone from the division commander to the animal caretakers participating. Starting on February 3rd, 5,800 commanders and fighters pulled more than 2,000 cubic meters of stone slabs in less than a week, completing one-third of the total. The sound of pulling stone slabs could be heard day and night in Dihua City, which greatly moved the people of all ethnic groups. A 60-year-old Uyghur man said gratefully: "As soon as the Liberation Army came, they sought happiness for the people and helped the people with production and construction. I have never seen such a good army!"

　　新疆军区生产运动即将全面展开
    各项准备工作已经基本完成
    【新华社迪化二十五日电】新疆军区部队生产运动，即将全面展开。南疆阿克苏地区驻军生产准备工作即可完成，订于三月一日展开大生产。焉耆地区某部，收集了大批废铁，由铁工出身的战士们赶制成农具，半月内已完成该部所需工具的半数。驻喀什某部，已在喀什、莎车、巴楚一带测定了五万三千多亩的土地，各单位已积肥七十六万余斤，制造了各式农具一万五千余件。该部某团在春节期间，举行了全团“生产准备大检阅”，展览自己的各式农具，对于不合标准的提出改进的方法。某部独立团已开赴阿山区采金。某部已在盛产细鳞鱼的博斯腾湖修筑引水渠和鱼槽，并在焉耆设厂制造渔船；汛水后即可开始捕鱼。该部并已完成开采哈麦沟煤矿的勘测工作，决定增开煤井三个，可以供应焉耆、库尔勒等地部队的全部燃料。迪化市驻军于二月初开始了修建和平渠的工程。该渠长十七公里，可灌田十万余亩。国民党统治时期，曾于一九四七年三月动工修建，耗费巨款仍未能完成。此次人民解放军某部负起此一艰巨任务后，指战员们发起竞赛热潮，决定在三月底前将施工所需的七千公方（约一万一千二百吨）石片，从二十六公里以外的地方，全部运达施工地点。全军热烈展开拉石片运动，从师长到饲养员一起参加。二月三日起，五千八百个指战员，在不到一星期的时间内，拉来了二千多公方石片，完成总数的三分之一。迪化市日夜都听得见拉石片的声音，各族市民极为感动。一个六十岁的维族老汉感激地说：“解放军一来就给人民谋幸福，帮助人民生产建设，我从来都没有见过这样的好队伍！”
