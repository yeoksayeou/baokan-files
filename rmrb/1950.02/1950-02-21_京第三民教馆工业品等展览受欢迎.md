Since the beginning of the exhibition, there have been five to six hundred visitors every day. They are particularly interested in the industrial products exhibition. They wrote in the suggestion book: "We have learned the greatness of labor, and the fruits of labor are precious," etc. The center will also extensively publicize and explain the new Sino-Soviet treaty through Spring Festival activities and various mass meetings.
