　　Implement the Policy of Production for Self-Salvation to Overcome Disasters
    Central Disaster Relief Committee Established
    Vice Premier Dong Biwu as Director
    [Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, February 27th] The Political and Legal Affairs Committee of the Government Administration Council, upon the order of the Government Administration Council, convened a meeting of relevant central government agencies today to establish the Central Disaster Relief Committee. Responsible personnel from thirteen units, including the Political and Legal Affairs Committee, Ministry of Internal Affairs, Financial and Economic Committee, Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Agriculture, Ministry of Water Resources, Ministry of Railways, Ministry of Transport, Ministry of Trade, Ministry of Food Industry, Cooperative Affairs Administration, Ministry of Health, and the All-China Women's Federation, attended. Vice Premier Dong Biwu presided over the meeting and delivered a report on production and disaster relief work. After heated discussion, the participants unanimously agreed that the current disaster situation nationwide, generally speaking, is not very serious, but is indeed serious in some individual areas. The winter famine has been successfully overcome through the efforts of cadres at all levels and the broad masses of the people. The most important issue at present is to overcome the spring famine, and the key lies in the quality of our production and disaster relief work. If the work is done well, a severe disaster can be turned into a minor one; otherwise, a minor disaster will turn into a severe one. Therefore, the policy of production for self-salvation must be implemented, and the main cadres of governments at all levels in disaster areas should personally lead this work. All departments must closely cooperate and work in coordination. The work of production and disaster relief committees at all levels must be strengthened to make them powerful agencies for leading the work. With this and the necessary relief from the Central People's Government, we are fully confident of overcoming the disaster. The meeting also discussed the development of social mutual assistance and a campaign for frugality in disaster relief. Finally, it was decided that Dong Biwu would be the Director of the Central Disaster Relief Committee, and Bo Yibo, Xie Juezai, Fu Zuoyi, and Li Shucheng would be the four Deputy Directors. Chen Qiyuan, Rong Zihe, Yao Yilin, Song Yuhe, Shi Zhiren, Li Yunchang, Li Dequan, Meng Yongqian, Ye Duyi, Xue Muqiao, and Luo Shuzhang and eleven others were named as members. It was also decided to invite two government councilors from the Government Administration Council, and one responsible person each from the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, the All-China Youth Federation, the Liberated Areas Relief General Office, and the People's Bank of China to serve as members of the committee. The Central Disaster Relief Committee has now begun work relying on the Ministry of Internal Affairs.

　　贯彻生产自救方针战胜灾荒
    中央救灾委员会成立
    董必武副总理为主任
    【新华社北京二十七日电】政务院政法委员会奉政务院命令于今日召集中央人民政府有关各机关开会，成立中央救灾委员会，到有政法委员会、内务部、财经委员会、财政部、农业部、水利部、铁道部、交通部、贸易部、食品工业部、合作事业管理局、卫生部及全国妇联等十三单位负责人员。会议由董必武副总理主持，并作了关于生产救灾工作的报告。经热烈讨论，与会者一致认为目前全国的灾情一般说来，并不算很严重，但个别地区确是严重的。冬荒在各级干部和广大人民的努力下已胜利渡过，目前最重要的问题是渡过春荒，其关键在于我们生产救灾工作的好坏，工作做得好，重灾即可变成轻灾；否则轻灾也要变为重灾。因此生产自救的方针，必须贯彻实现，灾区各级政府的主要干部，应亲自动手领导这一工作。各个部门须密切配合，协同动作。各级生产救灾委员会的工作必须加强，使它成为领导工作的有力机构。这样再辅之以中央人民政府必须的赈济，我们完全有信心渡过灾荒。会议并讨论了开展社会互济及节约救灾运动。最后确定以董必武为中央救灾委员会主任，薄一波、谢觉哉、傅作义、李书城等四人为副主任，陈其瑗、戎子和、姚依林、宋裕和、石志仁、李运昌、李德全、孟用潜、叶笃义、薛暮桥、罗叔章等十一人为委员。并决定请政务院派两位政务委员，全国总工会、全国青联、解放区救济总署、中国人民银行各派一负责人担任该会委员。现中央救灾委员会已依托内务部开始工作。
