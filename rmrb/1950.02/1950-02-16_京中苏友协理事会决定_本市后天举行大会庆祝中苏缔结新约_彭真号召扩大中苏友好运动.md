    [Beijing News] The Beijing Sino-Soviet Friendship Association Council held a plenary meeting at 8:00 PM yesterday (the 15th) to celebrate the signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance, and Mutual Assistance.

Those attending the council meeting included the association's president, Peng Zhen, vice-presidents Zhang Xiruo, Xu Deheng, Liu Ren, Xiao Ming, Zhang Xiaomei, as well as council members and representatives from general branches and branches, totaling over eighty people. First, Vice-President and Secretary-General Xu Deheng delivered an opening speech, saying: "The signing of this treaty is an epoch-making event of great historical significance. Due to the signing of this treaty, peace in the Far East is further consolidated, and the power of world peace is also strengthened. This fact shatters all the rumors of imperialism and the Kuomintang reactionaries' special agents, proving that the Soviet Union is a nation that truly loves freedom and peace. The joint cooperation of the two great nations of China and the Soviet Union and the people of the world will surely be able to crush all the conspiracies of the imperialists to provoke a new war." Subsequently, President Peng Zhen spoke. President Peng Zhen happily said: "The signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance, and Mutual Assistance and the two agreements is not only a fraternal alliance in opposing aggression and protecting peace, but also a friendly cooperation in political, economic, and cultural aspects." He also pointed out that the signing of these three treaties is of great help not only to the complete victory of the Chinese revolution, but also to the consolidation of the victory of the Chinese revolution, to China's industrialization and economic prosperity; it not only consolidates peace in the Far East but also has great significance for defending world peace and the democratic cause. The great Stalin and the socialist Soviet Union are the most sincere, enthusiastic, and selfless friends of the Chinese people, which has been greatly proven once again after countless facts. President Peng Zhen called on all levels of organizations and all members of the association to widely and deeply promote the significance of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance, and Mutual Assistance to the masses, and to consolidate and expand the Sino-Soviet friendship movement, to celebrate the signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance, and Mutual Assistance. After President Peng Zhen's speech, Vice-President Zhang Xiruo, Council Member Qian Duansheng, Zhu Changjiang, representative of the Beijing Power Industry Bureau Trade Union, You Shujing, representative of the Railway General Branch of the association, Lian Kuoru, representative of the Quyi circle, and others spoke in succession, all expressing their unanimous support for the signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance, and Mutual Assistance, and thanking Marshal Stalin and Chairman Mao for their great contributions to the friendly cooperation between the two great nations of China and the Soviet Union. Vice-President Zhang Xiruo and Council Member Qian Duansheng believe that the signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance, and Mutual Assistance and the two agreements guarantees the Chinese people's smooth path to freedom and happiness. Vice-President Zhang Xiruo said: "The cooperation between the two great nations of China and the Soviet Union is truly as friendly as between brothers. Our country must learn from the Soviet Union's construction experience to build a new China." The meeting decided to convene a celebration meeting at 12:00 PM on the 18th of this month in Tiananmen Square for the association's broad membership and people from all walks of life.
