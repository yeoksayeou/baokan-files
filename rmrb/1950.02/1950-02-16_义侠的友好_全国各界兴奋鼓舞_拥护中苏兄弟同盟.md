　　Righteous Friendship
    People from All Walks of Life Across the Country are Excited and Encouraged; Support the Sino-Soviet Brotherly Alliance
    Huang Yanpei
    The spirit of friendship between China and the Soviet Union has long existed. Today's publication of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance and the accompanying documents only clearly mark these spirits. How are they marked? By concretely writing them down in words. These written words have become an unprecedented, internationally unparalleled text filled with the highest concentration of amity and a spirit of righteousness.
    First, I hope that all my fellow countrymen will carefully read these documents word by word.
    First, my compatriots should pay attention to and understand that since the People's Liberation Army, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, liberated my compatriots, enabling everyone to stand up, we have gained the sympathy of many friendly countries in the world who have eagerly established diplomatic relations with us. The Soviet Union was the first to express its willingness to establish diplomatic relations with us, sending its message only 30 hours and 45 minutes after the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China announced its establishment on October 1, 1949. And today, it is the first and only country to sign a treaty of friendship, alliance, and mutual assistance with us.
    Second, our compatriots should also note and understand that only by standing on our own feet can we be qualified to receive help from others. Only when we aim at the lofty ideals of humanity, correctly establish our goals on the bright path that guides us, and strive forward regardless of all difficulties, will many people come to welcome you and jointly build new strength. The warm and great assistance that our New China has obtained from the Soviet Union is a good example.
    Third, our compatriots must also be prepared in the future to wholeheartedly dedicate all our strength to cooperate with the overall strength of socialist and new democratic countries, and fully exert ourselves to complete our unprecedented sacred mission.
    I also hope that the people of any country in the world, no matter which side you stand on, should understand that the strength of the alliance formed by our new democratic and socialist countries is absolutely not intended to be used in other aspects, but only to be used in the struggle for democracy and peace. Democracy is not false democracy, but the democracy of the people, where everyone stands up and fights for lasting peace. The door to peace is open, and everyone is welcome to come in. But we cannot forget that we are currently "grieving over past sorrows," particularly concerning the evil beast of Japan—who caused us Chinese decades of suffering, destroyed and plundered our countless resources, and poisoned and slaughtered countless of our people—and whose evil deeds have harmed not only our country. If Japan ever thinks of doing evil again, or if anyone uses it to do evil, then it is necessary to implement Article 1 of this treaty, which stipulates:
    "The two Contracting Parties undertake jointly to strive to secure the prevention of the resumption of aggression…" Conversely, the same article also stipulates:
    "Both Contracting Parties declare their readiness to participate, in the spirit of sincere co-operation, in all international actions aimed at ensuring peace & security throughout the world and will contribute all its strength to the realization of such purposes."
    I believe that if the inherent strength of this treaty is fully utilized, it can indeed prevent aggression by Japan and any country colluding with Japan, and it can indeed guarantee peace and security in East Asia and even the world. The latter is the reason for the former.
    From these documents, we can also see the unparalleled friendship of the Soviet Union towards China—unconditionally deciding to transfer the Chinese Changchun Railway, Lushun, and Dalian; unconditionally deciding to transfer the property and other assets obtained by the Soviet Union from Japan in Northeast China; and also providing China with a loan at an annual interest rate of one percent. Are the two words "friendship" enough to describe this? It should be called "righteous friendship."
    All compatriots of the People's Republic of China, stand up and strive! Strive!

　　义侠的友好
    全国各界兴奋鼓舞  拥护中苏兄弟同盟
    黄炎培
    中苏两个国家相互间友好的精神，早经存在了，有了今天发表的这份中苏友好同盟互助条约和同时发表的文件，只把这些精神很显明地标志了出来。用什么方法标志的呢？就是把它从文字上具体地写了出来，这次写出来的文字，就成为了国际间史无先例、充满着最高浓度的友爱、还带着义侠性的文字。
    首先希望我全国同胞人民把这些文件一字一句精细地读一下。
    第一点，我同胞人民要注意到而且要了解到，自从经过中国共产党领导的人民解放军解放了我同胞人民，使得大家都站了起来之后，取得了世界许多友好国家的同情，纷纷地和我建立起邦交来，而首先表示愿意和我建立邦交，从一九四九年十月一日中华人民共和国中央人民政府公告成立后，仅经过三十小时四十五分，就送达到这份表示的文电的，就是苏联，而今天又是第一的也是唯一的和我订立了友好同盟互助条约。
    第二点，我们同胞人民还应注意到而且要了解到世界只有自己站起来，才有资格接受人家的帮助，只有自己瞄准了从人类崇高的理想指示我们的一条光明大道上边所正确建立着的目标，不顾一切艰难困苦奔上去，自会有许多人来迎接你共同建立起新的力量来，我新中华取得苏联的亲切而伟大的助力就是很好的例子。
    第三点，我们同胞人民今后还得准备全心全意的拿出全副力量来配合社会主义国家和新民主主义国家整个的力量，充分的发挥来完成我们空前的神圣使命。
    我还希望全世界任何国家的民众不问你站在那一方面都应该了解到我们新民主主义国家，社会主义国家所团结构成的力量，绝对不想使用在其他方面，而只使用在争取民主，争取和平。民主，不是假的民主，是人民的民主，人人都站立起来，为了争取持久和平而奋斗，和平的大门是敞开着的，什么人都得进来，世界上凡是爱好和平的，来！来！可我们不能忘记的，我们正在“痛定思痛”的，就是曾经给我们中华吃过几十年苦，曾经毁坏掠夺我们无数资财，毒害屠杀我们无数人民生命的恶兽日本——遭他毒害的岂但我国——如果今后还想起来作恶，如果还有人利用他起来作恶，那就是要实行这份条约第一条规定——
    “双方保证共同尽力采取一切必要的措施，以期制止……”的。但相反地同条还规定：
    “双方并宣布愿以忠诚的合作精神，参加所有以确保世界和平与安全为目的之国际活动……充分贡献其力量。”
    我相信这份条约，把他内藏的力量，充分发挥出来，的确可以制止日本和与日本相勾结的任何国家的侵略，的确可以保障东亚乃至世界的和平和安全，他是为了后者，才有前者。
    从这些文件中，还看出苏联对我中华无可比喻的友好，——无偿地决定移交了中国长春铁路，旅顺，大连；无偿地决定移交了苏联在东北从日本手中获得的财产和其他，还给予中国年利百分之一的贷款，这些仅仅友好两个字，那够呢？应该称为“义侠的友好”。
    我中华人民共和国全部同胞人民站起来，努力！努力！
                              一九五○年二月十五日
