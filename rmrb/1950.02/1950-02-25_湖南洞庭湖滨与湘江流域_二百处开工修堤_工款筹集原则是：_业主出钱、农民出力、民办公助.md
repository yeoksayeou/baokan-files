　　Hunan's Dongting Lake and Xiang River Basin
    200 Construction Sites Launched to Repair Dikes
    Funding Principle: "Owners Pay, Farmers Contribute Labor, Government Provides Public Assistance"
    [Our Changsha Dispatch] The work of repairing dikes in Changde, Yiyang, Yuanjiang, Huarong, Nanxian, Anxiang, Hanshou, Xiangyin, Lixian, Yueyang, Linxiang and other eleven counties around Dongting Lake in Hunan Province, and in Changsha, Xiangtan and other counties in the Xiang River Basin has been fully launched. The eleven counties around the lake have a land area of six million mu, with fertile soil and abundant rice and cotton production. Assuming a yield of four shi of rice per mu, the annual rice production is over 20 million shi, earning it the title of Hunan's "Granary." Since the Ming Dynasty, the Yangtze River water has flowed into the lake from the northwest through the Songzi, Taiping, Ouchi, and Tiaoxian inlets, gradually depositing the sediment it carries, raising the lake bottom and shrinking the lake surface. As a result, the lake's flood storage capacity has decreased, and during the spring and summer floods, the lake water has nowhere to go, making it very easy to breach the lake dikes. During the Kuomintang rule, pseudo-officials colluded with former dike management personnel to embezzle funds and neglect their duties, resulting in disrepair of the dikes and frequent breaches. From 1931 to 1949, in a span of twenty years, disasters occurred on average once every five years, with even more frequent instances of waterlogging of the embanked fields. In both the previous and last year, there were continuous floods. Last year's major flood breached 337 embankments, with 620 breaches. The affected area in each county accounted for an average of 30 percent of its total land area. Changsha and Xiangtan along the Xiang River also suffered heavy losses. For example, 62 of the 142 embankments in Changsha were flooded, and coupled with insect plagues, the loss in production was about 20 percent. The peasants are eager to repair the dikes as soon as possible. The Hunan Provisional Provincial Government took the lead in organizing a lakeside survey team in September last year (one month after peaceful liberation) to investigate the dike breaches. It was decided that the current focus should be on blocking breaches and restoring dikes. It is estimated that the dike restoration and breach blocking project will require more than 18 million cubic meters of earthwork, with Yuanjiang, Yiyang, Nanxian, and Huarong having the largest projects. In November, instructions were issued to various localities, calling on the counties to mobilize the masses to repair the dikes and strive to complete all the work before the end of March this year. The Water Conservancy Bureau also dispatched more than 60 water conservancy cadres to various counties around the lake to assist in the work. Before the end of November last year, the counties had successively established leading organizations such as the County Dike Restoration Engineering Committee, reorganized the old Dike Affairs Bureau based on the opinions of the masses, and, with the embankment as a unit, democratically elected the Dike Affairs Committee by the embankment residents and their representatives, so that the masses could participate in leading and managing the dike repair. By mid-December last year, the counties had started construction one after another. According to incomplete statistics, since February, more than 200 dike construction sites have been launched in the counties, with nearly 80,000 people participating in the work. In Lixian and Nanxian, more than 10,000 peasants participate in dike repair every day. In some places, the old, young, and women are all mobilized to carry mud, dig earth, and boil tea and deliver meals. In some places, enthusiastic labor competitions have also been launched. At present, the counties have achieved preliminary results in dike repair, breach blocking, and draining waterlogged fields. The counties have completed more than one million cubic meters of earthwork. Anxiang County has now drained 500,000 mu of waterlogged fields, completing 73 percent of the county's drainage project. Regarding the collection of project funds, the general principle adopted in various localities is that owners pay, farmers contribute labor, and the government provides public assistance. The government has decided to allocate 30 million catties of grain as loans to embankments with economic value and whose residents are indeed unable to afford the costs. At present, the Changsha Special District has obtained a loan of 6 million catties, and the Yiyang and Changde Special Districts have each obtained 8 million catties. Yuanjiang, Hanshou, Yiyang and other counties have decided that embankments that have not been breached will generally not be granted loans, and the project funds will be raised entirely by themselves. The breached embankments will be granted a portion of grain loans based on their economic value and the size of the project. In addition to direct loans, the government will also recover a portion of the dike restoration loans granted to various embankments by the former Rural Reconstruction Committee during the Kuomintang period and use them for the dike repair project. In Changde and Linxiang alone, more than 1,000 shi of grain have been recovered. The dike repair situation in various localities is progressing extremely smoothly. (Guang Jun)

　　湖南洞庭湖滨与湘江流域
    二百处开工修堤
    工款筹集原则是：“业主出钱、农民出力、民办公助”
    【本报长沙讯】湖南省洞庭湖滨之常德、益阳、沅江、华容、南县、安乡、汉寿、湘阴、澧县、岳阳、临湘等十一县及湘江流域之长沙、湘潭等县的修复堤垸工作已全面展开。滨湖十一县土地面积有六百万亩，土质肥美，盛产稻棉，以每亩产稻四石计，年产稻谷约二千万石以上，有湖南“谷仓”之称。明朝以来，长江之水由松滋、太平、藕池、调弦诸口从西北分流入湖，所挟泥沙逐渐沉淀，湖底淤高，湖面缩小，因而湖的蓄洪量减少，春夏水涨，湖水无处宣泄，极易冲溃湖堤。在国民党统治时期，伪官吏与旧堤务人员勾结贪污塞职，致堤垸失修，经常溃决。从一九三一年至一九四九年二十年中，平均五年受灾一次，垸田渍水情形更多。前年和去年连续两年均遭水患，去年大水，溃垸三三七个，决口六二○处，各县受灾面积平均占其全部土地百分之三十。湘江沿岸的长沙、湘潭受灾也很重。例如长沙大小一百四十二个垸中即有六十二个被淹，加上虫灾，损失产量约百分之二十。农民渴望及早修复堤垸。湖南临时省政府于去年九月间（和平解放后一个月）即首先组织滨湖勘查团，调查堤垸溃决情形。决定现在以堵口复堤为主的方针。估计复堤堵口工程约需土方一千八百余万公方，其中以沅江、益阳、南县、华容工程较大。十一月间向各地发出指示，号召各县发动群众修复堤垸，争取于今年三月底以前全部完工。并由水利局派出水利干部六十余人分赴滨湖各县协助工作。去年十一月底以前，各县均已先后成立了县复堤工程委员会等领导机构，根据群众意见改组与整理了旧堤务局，以垸为单位，由垸民与垸民代表民主选举，成立堤务委员会，由群众参加领导管理修堤。至去年十二月中旬，各县均已先后动工。据目前不完全统计，二月以来，各县已有二百余处堤垸开工，参加工作的群众将及八万人。澧县南县每天均有万余农民参加修堤，有些地方老、幼、妇女齐动员挑泥挖土，烧茶送饭。有的地方并展开了热烈的劳动竞赛。现各县的修堤、堵口及排除垸田渍水等工程，均已获得初步成绩。各县完成土方已超过一百万公方。安乡县现已放干五十万亩田里的渍水，完成全县排水工程的百分之七十三。关于工款的筹集，各地一般掌握了业主出钱，农民出力，民办公助的原则。政府已确定拨粮三千万斤，贷与有经济价值而垸民确实不能负担的垸堤。现长沙专区已贷得六百万斤，益阳、常德两专区各八百万斤。沅江、汉寿、益阳等县决定未溃的垸，一般不贷米，工款全部自筹。已溃各垸则根据经济价值与工程大小，分别贷给一部粮食。政府除直接贷款外，并将国民党时期前农村复兴委员会贷放各垸复堤贷款收回一部，用于修堤工程上，仅常德、临湘两县即已收回现谷千石以上。各地修堤情况进行极为顺利。（光军）
