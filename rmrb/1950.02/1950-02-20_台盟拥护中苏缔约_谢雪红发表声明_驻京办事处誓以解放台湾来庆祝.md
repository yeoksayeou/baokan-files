Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, February 18th: Xie Xuehong, Chairman of the Taiwan Democratic Self-Government League, issued a statement here on the 17th, expressing warm support for the signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance and other agreements. Xie Xuehong said: This is an event that excites the people of the whole country, because this treaty and other agreements clearly show the solid unity of the people of the two major countries, China and the Soviet Union, and show that the Chinese people will no longer be afraid of the re-invasion of the imperialists. If the remaining forces of Japanese fascism and any imperialists dare to invade China again, they will surely be completely crushed by the people of China and the Soviet Union. At the same time, these agreements are also a great help to the recovery and development of the new Chinese economy. From the standpoint of the people of Taiwan, we feel very excited, we cheer heartily, and we express our utmost support. Because we understand that the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance and other agreements will accelerate the day of liberation for our people in Taiwan, and all the aggressive plots of American imperialists against Taiwan will surely suffer a complete and miserable defeat.

[Report from this newspaper] The spokesperson of the Beijing Office of the Taiwan Democratic Self-Government League Headquarters issued a statement in support of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance and related agreements:

　　The Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance and the agreements between China and the Soviet Union on the Chinese Changchun Railway, Lushun (Port Arthur), Dalian, and the loan agreement were successfully signed on February 14th.

　　This treaty and agreement prove that the Soviet people and the Soviet government not only in the past thirty years, but even now, and forever in the future, have always been the most reliable and most loyal friends of all peace-loving humanity, including the Chinese people.

　　It is a merciless, harsh, and fatal blow to all imperialist countries that are enemies of the people, oppress the people, and trample on the people, as well as their running dogs.

　　However, it brings to all oppressed people around the world who are bravely fighting for the cause of liberation unlimited confidence in liberation and endless strength for struggle.

　　American imperialism, today using the means of "undeclared peace," is supporting the resurgence of Japanese fascist forces, and in our sacred territory—Taiwan—is fully supporting the remnants of the Kuomintang bandit gangs, attempting to suppress the liberation cause of the Chinese people. But today, the unprecedented growth of the power of the world's people, especially the power of the people of China and the Soviet Union, has made American imperialism and the remaining bandit gangs tremble in despair.

　　Today, with excitement, we welcome this good news, and under the wise leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, we are willing to celebrate and support the victorious signing of this treaty and agreement with resolute actions to liberate Taiwan.

　　台盟拥护中苏缔约
    谢雪红发表声明
    驻京办事处誓以解放台湾来庆祝
    【新华社上海十八日电】台湾民主自治同盟主席谢雪红十七日在此间发表谈话，对中苏友好同盟互助条约及其他协定的签订表示热烈拥护。谢雪红说：这是一件使全国人民万分兴奋的事件，因为这个条约和其他协定很明确地表明了中苏两大国人民的巩固团结，表明中国人民从此以后将再也不怕帝国主义者的重新侵略了。假如日本法西斯残余势力和任何帝国主义者胆敢再次侵略中国，他们必定会被中苏两大国人民所彻底粉碎。同时，这些协定对新中国经济的恢复和发展也是一个很大帮助。站在台湾人民的立场来说，我们觉得非常兴奋，我们尽情欢呼，我们表示万分的拥护。因为我们明白了，中苏友好同盟互助条约及其他协定，将会使我们台湾人民解放的日子加速地到来，而美国帝国主义者对台湾的一切侵略阴谋，必定会遭到彻底的惨败。
    【本报讯】台湾民主自治同盟总部驻京办事处发言人对拥护中苏友好同盟互助条约及协定的声明：
    中苏友好同盟互助条约及中苏两国关于中国长春铁路、旅顺口、大连的协定和贷款协定已于二月十四日胜利地签订了。
    这个条约及协定证明了苏联人民和苏联政府不仅在过去三十多年，甚至在现在，并在永远的将来，一直不渝地是全世界爱好和平的人类，包括中国人民在内的最可靠、最忠诚的朋友。
    它对一切以人民为敌的，压迫人民，蹂躏人民的帝国主义国家以及其走狗们是一个无情，苛酷的致命打击。
    然而它给一切为解放事业而勇敢斗争的全世界被压迫人类带来了对解放的无限信心和对斗争的无穷力量。
    美国帝国主义，今天以“不宣而和”的手段，扶助日本法西斯势力的再起，并在我们神圣的领土——台湾，以全力支持国民党残余匪帮，妄图镇压中国人民的解放事业，但今天世界人民力量，首先是中苏两国人民力量的空前壮大，已使美国帝国主义及残余匪帮在绝望中发抖了。
    我们今天以兴奋的心情，迎接这个喜讯，并愿在中国共产党的英明领导下，以坚决解放台湾的行动来庆祝与拥护这个条约和协定的胜利签订。
