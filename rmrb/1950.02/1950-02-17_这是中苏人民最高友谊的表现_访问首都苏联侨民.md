    ——Visiting Soviet Nationals in the Capital
    Bai Sheng
    When the news that China and the Soviet Union had concluded a new Treaty of Friendship, Alliance, and Mutual Assistance and other agreements reached the more than 350 Soviet nationals residing in the capital, they cheered as enthusiastically as the people of Beijing.
    At the Soviet Consulate, introduced by Consul Seregin, the reporter happily met with Mr. Krachalev, chairman of the Soviet Nationals Association. This kind old man with white hair excitedly shared his joy with the reporter. He said: We Soviet nationals especially welcome the conclusion of this new treaty, and each of us wholeheartedly supports it. Now that our Sino-Soviet friendship is further consolidated, the aggressive conspiracies of international reactionaries will be even more impossible to realize. This treaty fully demonstrates the true friendship between the Chinese and Soviet peoples. The signing of the treaty is a manifestation of the highest friendship between the Chinese and Soviet peoples. Mr. Krachalev also praised the fact that the new China is gradually moving towards prosperity and strength, and the Chinese people have begun to develop their own economy and culture, and build their own prosperous country.
    When the reporter entered the office of the Soviet Nationals Association, many Soviet nationals warmly shook hands with the reporter. Lebelin, a 19-year-old Soviet youth who grew up in China, kindly introduced the Soviet friends present to the reporter in fluent Chinese. Then, we enthusiastically discussed the news about the Treaty of Friendship, Alliance, and Mutual Assistance and other agreements concluded between China and the Soviet Union without any distance between us. Ksakov, vice chairman of the Soviet Nationals Association, excitedly said: This news not only brought great joy to the people of China and the Soviet Union, but also because at a time when warmongers are trying their best to provoke war, this new treaty concluded between China and the Soviet Union, two major countries, will make world peace more secure, and it will certainly be warmly welcomed by the people of the world. Vinogradsky, Minister of Economy of the Soviet Nationals Association, added: Due to the signing of the Treaty of Friendship, Alliance, and Mutual Assistance between our two countries, the 475 million people of China and the more than 200 million people of the Soviet Union, united together, can become a great force for safeguarding peace. Mamaeva, Minister of Women of the Soviet Nationals Association, continued: These new treaties and agreements also completely shattered the shameless provocations of the warmongers between the Soviet Union and China. For those nations that have not yet been liberated, it will also increase the courage to resolutely strive for the road to liberation. Mamaeva also expressed, on behalf of all Soviet women living in Beijing, their willingness to jointly celebrate with the women of Beijing the signing of this new treaty of great historical significance. At the same time, she specially proposed to pay tribute and congratulations to the Chinese People's Liberation Army, which has played a major role in the Chinese people's liberation struggle. They all expressed their belief that under the wise leadership of Marshal Stalin and Chairman Mao, the friendship between China and the Soviet Union will be permanently consolidated and developed.
    Finally, Lebelin, the Soviet youth who had grown up in China for more than ten years, excitedly said to the reporter in fluent Chinese: When he lived in the unliberated Chinese land in the past, he had no opportunity to say to any Chinese youth "We want to be friendly with China." After the liberation of Beijing, he has been able to hold hands closely with Chinese youth. "Now, after the conclusion of this new treaty," he said enthusiastically, "I can more freely tell all my Chinese friends about our friendship!" Finally, Vinogradsky added: "In order to celebrate the conclusion of the Treaty of Friendship, Alliance, and Mutual Assistance between our two countries today, I hope that our two peoples will learn each other's languages ​​and scripts, so that the culture of our two countries can be exchanged more smoothly and develop side by side."

　　这是中苏人民最高友谊的表现
    ——访问首都苏联侨民
    柏生
    当中苏两国缔结了新的友好同盟互助条约及其他协定的消息传到了居住在首都的三百五十余位苏联侨民中间的时候，他们也和首都的中国人民一样报以热烈的欢呼。
    在苏联领事馆，由谢列金领事的介绍，记者愉快地会到了苏联侨民公会主席克拉柴夫。这位白发斑驳的和蔼的老人兴奋地向记者谈出了他的喜悦。他说：我们苏联侨民特别欢迎这新条约的缔结，我们每一个人都从心底热诚地拥护它。现在我们中苏友好的进一步巩固，使国际反动分子的侵略阴谋将更不能实现。这条约十足地表现了中国人民和苏联人民的真正友好。条约的签订正是中苏两国人民最高友谊的表现。克拉柴夫先生并赞誉目前新中国已逐渐走向富强的道路，中国人民已开始发展自己的经济和文化，建设自己繁荣的国家。
    当记者进入苏联侨民公会办公室的时候，许多苏联侨民热烈地和记者握手。一位在中国长大的十九岁的苏联青年列别林，亲切地用着流利的中国话为记者一一介绍在场的苏联朋友。接着我们便不分彼此地热烈地畅谈起关于中苏两国缔结的友好同盟互助条约及其他协定的消息来。苏侨公会副主席克萨克夫兴奋地说：这消息不仅带给了中苏两国人民以极大的喜悦，而且因为在战争贩子们正在竭力挑拨战争的时候，中苏两大国缔结的这一新条约，将会使世界和平更有保障，它一定也获得全世界人民的热烈欢迎。苏侨公会经济部长维诺格拉得斯基补充说：由于我们两国的签订友好同盟互助条约，中国的四万万七千五百万人民和苏联的二万万多人民联合起来，是可以成为一个极大的保障和平的力量。苏侨公会妇女部长马麻也瓦接着说：这些新条约新协定也彻底粉碎了战争贩子们对苏联和中国之间的那些无耻的挑拨。对于那些尚未解放的民族也将增加了坚决向解放道路奋进的勇气。马麻也瓦并代表居住在北京的所有苏联妇女表示愿意与北京市的妇女们共同联欢，来庆祝这个具有重大历史意义的新条约的签订。同时她并特别提出要向对于中国人民解放斗争起着绝大作用的中国人民解放军致敬和祝贺。他们都表示，相信在斯大林大元帅和毛主席的英明领导下，中苏两国的友好将得到永久的巩固与发展。
    最后，那位生长在中国十余年的苏联青年列别林用着生动的中国话兴奋地向记者说：当从前他生活在没有得到解放的中国土地上时，根本没有机会能使他去对任何一个中国青年说出“我们要和中国友好”的话来，北京解放后已能和中国青年亲密地携起手来，“现在这个新条约缔结以后”，他热情地说：“我更可以随意地对我的一切中国朋友们去倾诉我们的友情了！”末了，维诺格拉得斯基补充说：“为了庆祝今天我们两国缔结友好同盟互助条约，我希望我们两国人民彼此学习两国的语言和文字，以便使我们两国的文化可以更畅快地交流起来，并肩向前发展。”
