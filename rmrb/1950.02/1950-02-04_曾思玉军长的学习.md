　　Army Commander Zeng Siyu's Study
    Sun Chong
    Every comrade who knows Army Commander Zeng Siyu is sincerely in awe of his attitude and spirit towards learning.
    In more than twenty years of combat, no matter how difficult the environment, how frequent the marches and battles, or how busy the daily work, he always squeezed out time, even sacrificing sleep, to insist on studying for more than two hours every day. Reading books and newspapers, writing daily life diaries and work diaries have become his habits.
    During the New Year, I was assigned to visit Army Commander Zeng's study life. He humbly and sincerely talked about some of his learning experiences and insights. He said: First, one must have a correct attitude towards learning. That is to say, learning is to transform thinking, improve work, enhance political level and work efficiency, and improve one's organization and planning, so as to better fight the enemy and serve the people. Only when this problem is solved will learning be on the right track. And one will become more and more interested in learning.
    Second, one must develop the habit of learning, develop affection for it, and have perseverance. Army Commander Zeng said: "Anything is easy to handle once you get into the habit!" Take keeping a diary as an example: he started in 1935 and has been doing it for fourteen years now. No matter how busy he is, he has never missed a day of writing a daily life diary. In his diary, there is a work plan and requirements for the whole year at the beginning of each year, and a review and summary of the situation of life, work, and study for the whole year at the end of each year. Even now, he still keeps his daily life diaries from 1945 to the present. Whenever he has time, he revisits these diaries. From them, he examines his work, study, and experiences in the struggle against the enemy; this has given him great inspiration and help. He has a strong interest and affection for learning. He said, "If I don't learn something for a day, I feel guilty, as if I have wasted the day."
    Third, one must use one's brain when learning, proceed from reality, closely integrate with work, study problems, summarize experience, and achieve "one step forward after each battle" and "continuous improvement." He has always attached importance to summarizing experience, the most practical learning method. He said: "Frequently summarizing the experience and lessons in military struggles (the same is true for other work) is the best way to improve oneself. After summarizing experience, one's understanding of problems becomes profound, and one can 'take one step forward after each battle'." The same is true in other work. Whether he attends a meeting (political work, logistics, study), or a mass meeting, he always has a detailed outline beforehand for each of his speeches, or work summaries, or problem reports. He also succinctly records some important opinions of others at the meeting in his notebook. He regards participating in all daily activities as the most specific learning task. When I visited him, I saw various notebooks, large and small, of various colors, full of various experience summaries, preserved in his suitcase, including summaries of various battles in military affairs (from the War of Resistance Against Japan to the present), political work, and life cultivation, which made people amazed and envious. Army Commander Zeng treasures these notebooks as his most valuable property, and often revisits and studies them. He said: "Studying these summarized struggle experiences is of the greatest help to me in improving myself and in systematically recalling problems and understanding problems."
    Fourth, carefully study, closely pay attention to new things and attach importance to studying the struggle experiences of others, take notes and summaries to help memory. When browsing those large and small study notebooks, I deeply felt: Army Commander Zeng really studied carefully. Over the past few years, important materials from newspapers and important experiences related to the work of the troops, important editorials and commentaries from Xinhua News Agency, work reports from leaders of the corps, and learning documents designated in previous cadre studies in the army (such as the past Second Plenary Session news, and the recent Common Program), all have concise excerpts in his notebook. Many of these notes have red and blue pencil markings and lines. The method of taking notes and making summaries has become a regular system in his learning. He reads newspapers every day, and repeatedly reads important editorials in the newspapers (military newspapers, non-military newspapers). He closely pays attention to and studies various struggle experiences (military, political, construction) introduced in newspapers and reports of new things. When reading newspapers, he often refers to the map of China on the wall, and marks the development of the Liberation War and the places liberated every day with colored pens, marking out the situation. He remembers very clearly the domestic situation of each period and what places have been liberated. He can recite the main contents of some important documents, such as the "Eight Chapters of the People's Liberation Army."
    Fifth, learn from the masses. Army Commander Zeng pays attention to listening to the reports and opinions of the comrades below whenever he attends a meeting, and carefully records some important materials in his notebook. He attaches great importance to these materials reflected from the masses. Sometimes he personally goes down to understand some problems and absorb some experiences as the basis for improving work and improving command. After the Xinbao'an Campaign, he personally convened a forum of more than 20 company and platoon leaders who were in charge of the spearhead company and deep battle missions to study and summarize the practical experience of breakthroughs and street battles in this battle. He regards this method of learning from the masses as one of the main learning methods to enrich himself and improve himself. He said: "Listening to reports from below is the best way to enrich leadership." "Leading cadres should often go down to see what is being done below, and listen to what is being said below. In this way, they will understand many problems, and they will have the capital and the power to guide the work below."
    Sixth, comprehensive learning. Army Commander Zeng is a military commander. In addition to military learning, he attaches great importance to political learning and cultural learning. His reading range is very broad, including military, political, and literary aspects. When I browsed the army commander's study notebook, I found that he carefully extracted and recorded in his notebook some aphorisms from the novel "Fear and Fearlessness" by Battalion Commander Bavurzhang and Division Commander Panfilov on troop training and command. He said that he likes to read Soviet novels very much, and he has read more than 20 kinds of things in this area in recent years.
    Regarding learning, Army Commander Zeng said based on his own personal experience: "Learning mainly depends on self-consciousness. Learning is our daily responsibility, and we must develop a habit of loving learning. We are all people's cadres and revolutionary military professionals. In order to do our work well, we must learn, and we must enable each of us to gradually improve in learning and become a cadre with a high level of political, military, and cultural knowledge!" He humbly stated: "My study is just a beginning, and there are still many shortcomings. In the past period, due to the unstable environment in the field, I lacked the organized and planned further systematic study of some theoretical things. In the future, when the environment is stable, I will work hard in this direction!" He said: "It is wrong for some comrades from worker and peasant backgrounds to lack confidence in learning at present. The skill of us communists is to be good at learning and constantly seek progress from learning. As long as there is determination, there is nothing that cannot be learned. I didn't go to school much when I was young. Some of the knowledge I have now was learned in the revolutionary army for more than 20 years."

　　曾思玉军长的学习
    孙冲
    曾思玉军长的学习态度和学习精神，每一个熟悉他的同志都是衷心敬佩的。
    在二十多年的战斗生活中，不管环境多么艰苦，行军作战多么频繁，日常工作多么忙碌，他总要挤出时间以至牺牲一些睡眠，坚持每天两小时以上的学习。看书、看报、写生活日记和工作日记，已经成了他的习惯。
    新年里，我奉派去访问曾军长的学习生活，他谦虚而诚恳地谈了一些学习情形和学习心得。他说：首先，要有一个正确的学习态度。这就是说，学习是为了改造思想，改进工作，提高政治水平和工作效率，提高自己的组织性、计划性，以便更好的和敌人斗争，为人民服务。只有这个问题解决了，学习才对头。才越学越有兴趣。
    第二、对学习要养成习惯，发生感情，要有恒心。曾军长说：“什么事情，一养成习惯就好办了！”举个例子来说，记日记：他从一九三五年开始，到现在已经十四年了，不管怎样忙，生活日记从没有中断过一天。他的日记本上，每年年初都有一年的工作计划和要求，每年年底都有一年的生活、工作、学习情形的回忆与总结。直到现在，他还保存着从一九四五年至现在的生活日记。一有功夫，就重温这些日记。从中检查工作、学习、对敌斗争的经历；这曾给他以很大启发和帮助。他对学习有了浓厚的兴趣和感情，他说：“如果一天不学习点东西，便感到像白过了一天似的歉疚”。
    第三、学习要用脑子，从实际出发，紧紧结合工作，研究问题，总结经验，作到“打一仗，进一步”和“不断地提高”。他一向重视总结经验这一最实际的学习方法，他说：“经常总结军事斗争中（其他工作也一样）的经验教训，对自己是个最好的提高。经过总结经验，对问题的认识深刻了，就能够‘打一仗，进一步’了。”在其他工作上也一样，不论参加一个什么会议（政工的、后勤的、学习的），或者参加一个群众性的大会，每次他的发言，或总结工作或报告问题，事先都有详细的提纲。对会议上别人的一些重要意见，他也扼要地记录到自己的笔记本上。他把参加日常一切活动，都当成最具体的学习任务。在我访问他时，看到了保存在他箱子里的大大小小的、各色各样的、写得满满的各种经验总结的笔记本子，有军事方面的各次战役总结（从抗日战争到现在），有政治工作方面的，有生活修养方面的，真使人又惊叹又羡慕。这些笔记本，曾军长都把它当作最贵重的财产珍藏在身边，经常加以重温与研究，他说：“研究这些总结出来的斗争经验，对我自己提高上和有系统的回忆问题，理解问题上帮助最大”。
    第四、细心钻研，密切关心新鲜事物和重视研究别人的斗争经验，做笔记、提要，帮助记忆。在翻阅那些大大小小的学习笔记本时，我深深感到：曾军长学习得真是细心。几年来，报纸上的重要材料和有关部队工作的重要经验，新华社的重要社论、时评，兵团首长们的工作报告和历次本军干部学习中所指定的学习文件（如过去的二中全会新闻，最近的共同纲领）等，在他的笔记本中，都有扼要的节录。这些摘记有很多地方划有红蓝铅笔记号、标线。写笔记、做提要这一方法，已成为他学习上的经常制度了。他每天看报，对报纸上（军内报纸、军外报纸）的重要社论，都要反复阅读，报纸上介绍的一些斗争经验（军事上的、政治上的、建设上的）和报导的一些新鲜事物，他都密切加以注意与研究学习。看报纸时，他经常对照墙壁上的中国地图，把解放战争发展的形势和每天解放的地方都用彩色笔打上记号，标出形势，对于每一时期的国内形势和解放了些什么地方，他都记得很清楚。一些重要的文件，如“人民解放军约法八章”他都能背诵出它的主要内容。
    第五、向群众学习。曾军长平时参加任何一个会议，都很注意倾听下面同志的汇报和意见，认真地将一些重要材料记录在自己的笔记本上，对这些从群众中反映上来的材料，他很重视。有时他亲自到下面去了解一些问题，吸取一些经验来作为改进工作、改进指挥的依据。新保安战役结束后，他曾亲自召集了二十多个担任尖刀连以及纵深战斗任务的连、排长开座谈会，研究总结这次战斗中的突破与巷战的实战经验，他把这种向群众学习的方法，当做丰富自己，提高自己的主要学习方法之一。他说：“听下面汇报，是丰富领导的最好的方法。”“领导干部经常到下面去看看，看看下面是怎样做的，听听下面是怎样说的，这样就会了解很多问题，再指导下面工作时，就有资本了，也有力量了。”
    第六、全面学习。曾军长是一个军事指挥员，除了军事方面的学习以外，他非常重视政治学习和文化学习。他的阅读范围很广阔，军事的，政治的，文艺的各方面的东西他都看。我在翻阅军长的学习笔记本时，发现他把“恐惧与无畏”那本小说里营长巴武尔章和潘菲洛夫师长关于练兵和指挥上的一些警句，都用心地摘记在笔记本上。他说他很喜欢读苏联小说，这几年中他已看了二十多种这方面的东西。
    关于学习，曾军长根据自己切身体验说：“学习主要是靠自觉，学习是我们每天应尽的责任，一定要养成爱好学习的作风。我们都是人民的干部，革命的军事职业家，为了要把工作做好，就必须学习，必须使我们每个人都能在学习中逐步提高到成为一个具有高度政治、军事、文化水平的干部！”他很谦虚地表示：“我的学习，还只是一个开始，缺点还很多，过去这一个时期中，由于野战中环境不稳定，缺乏有组织有计划的进一步系统的学习一些理论东西，今后环境安定了，我要朝这方面努力！”他说：“目前某些工农出身的同志对学习没有信心是不应该的，我们共产党人的本领就是善于学习，从学习中不断求进步。只要有决心，没有学不到的东西。我幼小时没有上过什么学，现有的一些知识，都是在革命部队中二十多年中学习得来的。”
