　　On Parliamentary Struggle and General Elections
　　British Communist MP Piratin
　　(Notes based on a report given at the Communist Party Summer School on August 9, 1949.)

　　With the general election approaching, we have published our election platform. Now, the Party's attention is turning to parliamentary struggle. However, it is worth noting that despite the many theoretical discussions on the role of parliament, there is still a tendency towards sectarianism—a tendency to believe that election campaigns disrupt our general daily work.

　　There is an essential difference between the Communist Party and other parties that claim to represent the working class. Those parties proclaim that all political work is parliament. This is the only form of "struggle" they recognize. But for the Communist Party, there are many different forms of struggle, depending on the stage of development and tactical needs, all aimed at advancing the stage struggle to a higher level. This struggle often takes place through trade unions, tenant associations, peace movements, parliament, and so on. The working class understands this; they participate in these struggles and understand these changing forms of struggle.

　　"But"—I can hear an angry shout—"parliament is a bourgeois institution, unlike trade unions and the like." But factories are also bourgeois institutions, yet we still work in them and form factory groups. I must hasten to add that parliament naturally has its specific responsibilities, which will be discussed below.

　　This sectarian attitude towards parliamentary work and participation in elections has long been prevalent in the British working-class movement, especially among certain "leftists." After the First World War, this was not only a national issue of debate but also an international one. This was one of the key issues discussed by Lenin at the early meetings of the Communist International, and it raised many serious questions for the young British Communist Party. We had many excellent comrades who opposed participation in parliamentary work. They argued that it was degenerate and created dangerous social-democratic illusions among the working class. Lenin, in several articles, amidst intense discussions on this issue, explained it very clearly. First, he described the situation of parliament and the arguments of those who opposed participation in parliamentary struggle:

　　"…the entire history of bourgeois democracy, especially in the advanced countries, has turned parliament into an unprecedented arena of graft, financial and political deception of the people, careerism, hypocrisy, and oppression of the toilers." (Selected Works of Lenin, Vol. 10, p. 170)

　　Lenin understood all this, yet he strongly advocated participation in parliamentary work:

　　"Can we imagine another institution that involves all classes as much as parliament does? It cannot be artificially created. All classes are drawn into parliamentary struggle precisely because conflicts of interest are definitely manifested within parliament. … Parliament is the arena of class struggle." (Ibid., p. 247)

　　Lenin said that since this is the case, then the Communist Party must participate in bourgeois parliaments, especially when parliament is still very important to the backward masses who have not yet fully understood it:

　　"This rostrum (parliament) is of particular importance in the eyes of the broadest masses of backward toilers, or those imbued with petty-bourgeois prejudices; therefore, it is absolutely necessary for Communists to carry out propaganda, agitation, and organizational work precisely from this rostrum." (Ibid., p. 170)

　　Only by being elected to parliament is it possible, based on certain historical conditions, to oppose bourgeois society and the parliamentary system. It must be changed from both the outside and the inside:

　　"To decide once every few years which member of the ruling class is to repress and oppress the people through parliament—this is the real essence of bourgeois parliamentarism… But if we raise the question of the state, if we regard parliamentarism as one of the instruments of the state, from the point of view of the tasks of the proletariat in this sphere, where is the way out of parliamentarism?

　　"The way out of parliamentarism is not, of course, the abolition of representative institutions and elections, but the conversion of the representative institutions from talking shops into 'working' bodies... 'Not parliamentary but working' bodies—this is a direct hit at the present-day parliamentarians and social-democratic 'lap dogs'!" (The State and Revolution, p. 37).

　　Therefore, instead of abandoning parliament and refusing—no matter how noble the reasons—to participate in its work, we should, on the contrary, treat it like any other bourgeois institution and work to change it. This is how Lenin clarified the issue and refuted the sectarian arguments against participating in parliamentary work.

　　So parliament is a place of class struggle, where a large majority of the working class and most of the issues they consider important are discussed and dealt with. At the same time, it is part of the state machinery through which the bourgeoisie oppresses the working class, which gives it a special character. It deceives the working class into believing that it reflects their democratic will, and today, no party is as enthusiastic and vigorous in playing this trick of deceiving the working class as the Social Democratic Party (in Britain, the Labour Party—translator), especially its right wing.

　　Therefore, our task is not only to use parliament as a platform to expose its ugliness and shatter the democratic illusions deliberately cultivated by the capitalists and their right-wing social democratic cronies, but also to work in such a way that a large number of Communists are elected as members of parliament, so that we can use this to prepare to turn a "talking shop" into a "working body." For, if we win enough support from the working class to elect many Communists, then the support of the masses outside parliament will provide the necessary support for the work inside parliament.

　　Although parliament is detached from the masses, it would be a great mistake to think that mass movements have no impact on it. On the contrary, parliament is particularly sensitive to mass actions. A strong movement outside parliament will cause waves inside parliament, sometimes very high waves, as can be seen during the dockworkers' strike. This is an aspect of parliamentary work (and the work of local councils in their own areas) that is often overlooked by Marxists who have not been able to deeply understand this benefit. Communists must consider, from this or that mass movement, whether, if well organized and implemented, it will not only affect the entire parliament, but especially the members of parliament elected for the areas where the struggle is taking place, as well as those ministers sitting in the front row. There have been many such examples in the past few years. If we do not understand that the factors determining parliamentary work are ultimately mass pressure and mass action, then much of the work we do in parliament can be negated.

　　Just by paying attention to the reactions to various speeches in the House of Commons, one will know that a member of parliament representing a large trade union or whose constituency is experiencing a struggle is more noticed than a member of parliament without mass support. This is why Hugh Dalton, as a central organizer of a large trade union, had such an impact when attacking Cripps' budget, and why Mr. Mellish was particularly noticed during the dockworkers' strike. All Communists must understand this, especially those members who have influence in their respective trade unions. Because it is extremely necessary to explain this to the organized working class; to point out to them where the real power lies and how they can defeat the policies of the current government and achieve the changes they earnestly desire. Failure to do this means that the masses will continue to be ruled by parliamentary "democracy," which, as The Times recently pointed out, can only continue on its current basis if there is a fundamental consensus between the government and the opposition, that is, acceptance of the capitalist system.

　　If we regard mass movements as the foundation of our work to advance the class struggle, and if we look at parliamentary work from this perspective, then parliamentary activities and parliamentary elections will be properly assessed, and we will be able to accurately understand the significance of this form of activity for our overall movement.

　　Let us be clear and explicit. For example, our goal in the next election is to defeat the capitalist forces of the Conservative Party; to expose the right-wing Labour leaders, and to elect as many Communists as possible, so that we can strengthen the forces of our struggle inside and outside parliament. Most importantly, in putting forward these goals, our entire policy must demonstrate and be seen as a way out of the Conservative-dominated policies of the right-wing Labour leaders.

　　In this regard, we have heard criticism. One argument is that these goals are contradictory. They say that at present, apart from the Conservative Party, there is only the Labour Party, so we should only take a few nominal seats to avoid jeopardizing Labour's victory. The reasoning of another argument is just the opposite. They say that since both the Conservative Party and the Labour Party are implementing the same policies of attacking the working class and supporting capitalism, we should not support either of them and should not participate in the election. Thus, we arrive at a situation where both sides demand that the Party play no significant role in the election at all, and adopt a passive attitude, advising the working class not to participate in voting. In short, it means that we abandon leadership precisely when national political life reaches a climax.

　　Are these comrades not ignoring the role of the Party, ignoring the long-term prospects and the needs of the current situation, ignoring the developing actions of the working class and their need for strong, fighting leadership? Are these comrades not confusing the Conservative Party with the entire Labour movement, not ignoring that the masses of the Labour Party can be won over, that the position of the Labour right wing is not impregnable, and that they and their policies can still be defeated? The method of non-participation must be on a huge scale to be effective. If we have such a large influence and can make a large number of workers not participate, then obviously we should devote ourselves to elections and campaign in the areas where we have this huge mass influence. This will turn a passive method into a very active action. Those who propose this opinion do not see the positive aspects of this suggestion, proving that their views are affected by the current difficulties.

　　We are entering a period of increasing attacks on the working class. There are still fierce struggles ahead, so it is clear that our Party must stand up and lead the struggle of the working class. Our Party must prove that it is different from the Labour Party, that it is the defender of the working class and their lives, a fighter for socialism, not tainted and damaged by the right-wing policies of the Labour leaders.

　　The workers' disappointment with right-wing policies is growing, especially in industrial areas, and despite the torrent of anti-communist propaganda, workers are increasingly willing to listen to our arguments. The working class is recognizing from their own experience what the consequences of the current government's right-wing policies are, but whether the workers correctly learn this lesson depends on our Party, depends on whether they think we are better than the Labour Party; whether they think we are a serious political force—and workers often base their judgment of whether a party is serious on the party's election work. Which of you has not heard sincere workers say that we Communists are a good bunch of people, but since we only have two members of parliament in the House of Commons, what can we do?

　　Regardless of how we feel, the fact remains that millions of sincere workers regard parliament and parliamentary representation as the main factors in determining whether a political party is serious. If, at a time like this, when the working class is beginning to take action, when national political life reaches a climax, and when people from all walks of life are discussing and comparing various programs and policies, we only put forward a handful of candidates to participate in this election, how can we have an impact, how can people understand our policies? What will the workers think of us? If, on the contrary, we put forward candidates to participate in the election in all possible places, our words can be transmitted to millions of people. If we do this, and if we conduct independent election campaigns in places where we cannot put forward candidates to run, then our program and policies will be transmitted to places where our Party has rarely gone. Our good policies will be presented to the people, and our struggle against capitalism and for socialism will help to re-inspire many workers who have been confused by right-wing propaganda and the policies of the Labour government.

　　Therefore, parliamentary work is inseparable from the class struggle. This issue must be dealt with in the same way that we deal with all issues—that is, leading the working class and fighting for the working class. This is one aspect of our work, a coordinated part of the Party's overall work, not separate from it, but helping to advance our industrial or other activities, just as these activities in turn help to advance our election and parliamentary work.

　　论国会斗争与大选
    英共议员  皮拉丁
    （根据一九四九年八月九日在共产党暑期学校中所作报告的笔记。）
    大选渐渐临近，我们已经发表了竞选纲领，现在，党的注意正转向于国会斗争。但是，可以注意的是，尽管对国会的作用理论上的探讨很多，仍然有着一种宗派主义的倾向——认为竞选斗争会扰乱我们一般的日常工作的倾向。
    在共产党与自命代表工人阶级的其他政党之间有着本质的区别。那些党声言政治工作的一切的一切就是国会。这是他们所承认的唯一的一种“斗争”形式。但在共产党，却有多种多样的斗争形式，依一定的发展阶段，依策略上的需要而定，一切都是为了把阶段斗争推进到一个较高的阶段。这种斗争常常通过工会、房客协会、和平运动、国会等等进行。工人阶级懂得这点，他们参加这些斗争，了解这些变化着的斗争形式。
    “但是”——我能够听到一种恼怒的喊声——“国会是资产阶级的机关，和工会之类不一样。”可是，工厂也是资产阶级的机关，我们却仍旧在里面工作，并且组成工厂小组。我得赶紧补说一句，就是国会自然有其特定的职责，这一点下面即将讨论到。
    这种对待国会内工作和参加选举工作的宗派主义态度，在英国工人阶级运动中流行已久，特别是在某些“左派”中间。在第一次世界大战之后，这不仅是全国争论的问题，而且是国际上争论的问题。这是列宁在共产国际初期会议上讨论过的关键问题之一，它给英国年青的共产党提出了许多严重的问题。我们有许多极好的同志反对参加国会内的工作。他们争论说，这是堕落，并在工人阶级中间造成危险的社会民主主义的幻想。列宁曾在几篇文章里，于紧张讨论这个问题中间，十分明白地解释过这个问题。首先，他说明了国会的情形以及反对参加国会斗争者的论据之所在：
    “……资产阶级民主的整个历史，特别是在先进的国家里面，已把国会变成史无前例的营私舞弊、财政和政治上欺骗人民、钻营、伪善和压迫劳动者的主要舞台或主要舞台之一。”（列宁选集第十卷，第一百七十页）
    列宁明白这一切，虽然如此，他却力主参加国会工作：
    “我们能设想另外一个机实，关系到一切阶级，像国会这样吗？这是不能人工地创造的。一切阶级之所以都卷入国会斗争，就是因为利害矛盾确关在国会内表现出来。……国会是阶级斗争的舞台。”（同上，第二百四十七页）
    列宁说，既然如此，那末共产党就必须参加资产阶级的国会，特别是当国会对于那些还没有把它认识透彻的落后群众还很重要的情况下：
    “这个讲台（国会）在最广大的落后劳动群众眼中，或是在充满小资产阶级偏见的人眼中，是特别来得重要的；因此，恰恰就是从这个讲台来进行宣传、鼓动、组织的工作，对于共产党人说来，是绝对必要的。”（同上，第一百七十页）
    只有被选入了国会，才有可能，根据一定历史条件的基础，反对资产阶级社会和国会制度。它必须从外面并从内面来加以改变：
    “每数年一次去解决统治阶级何人应当在国会中来摧残和压迫民众——这便是资产阶级代议制之本质，……但是，如果提到国家这个问题，如果把代议制看作是国家的机关之一，从无产阶级在这一方面的任务的观点上来说，那末，跳出代议制的出路在那里呢？
    “跳出代议制的出路，当然不在取消代表机关和选举制，而是在于把‘清谈馆’式的代表机关，变为实际‘工作的’团体。……‘不是议会的而是工作的’机关——这是直接对准着现代社会民主党议员们和国会‘守房门的小狗们’说的！”（国家与革命，第三十七页）。
    因此，我们不是丢开国会和拒绝——不论是用什么样高尚的理由——参加它的工作，而是相反，像对待其他资产阶级的机关一样地对待它，并进行工作，加以改变。这是列宁用来澄清这个问题，击破宗派主义反对参加国会工作的论点。
    所以国会乃是阶级斗争的一个场所，涉及工人阶级的很大多数以及他们认为重要的大部分问题，都在这里讨论和处理。它同时又是资产阶级压迫工人阶级的国家机器的一部分，而这就给了它以特别的性质。它欺骗工人阶级，使他们以为它反映他们民主的意志，而在今天，再没有那一个政党像社会民主党（在英国即为工党——译者），特别是其右翼，这样热中和大力地耍这一套欺骗工人阶级的把戏。
    因此，我们的任务不仅是利用国会作为一个讲台，揭露它的丑恶，击破资本家及其幕僚右翼社会民主党人所蓄意培育起来的民主幻想，而且还要这样进行工作，使大量的共产党人当选为国会议员，使我们能够借此准备把一个“清谈馆”变成一个“工作的团体”。因为，如果我们争取到足够的工人阶级的支持，使许多共产党人当选，那末，议会外面的群众的支持将给予在议会内的工作以必要的支持。
    虽然国会脱离群众，但若以为群众运动对它不发生影响，就非常错误。相反，国会对群众的行动反应特别灵敏。国会外的一次强有力的运动，会在国会内引起波澜，有时还是很高的波澜，如在码头工人罢工期间将能看见的。这是国会工作（以及各地方议会在它们自己领域内的工作）上一个常常为没有能够深刻认识这一好处的马克思主义者所忽略的方面。共产党人必须从这个或那个群众运动着想，看看如果组织得好并且贯彻下去，会不会不仅影响整个国会，而且特别还影响那些为发生斗争地区选出的议员以及那些坐在前排的部长们。过去几年中间有过许多这样的例子。如果不了解，决定国会工作的因素到头来还是群众压力和群众行动，则我们在国会方面所做的工作，有许多都可以打消。
    只要注意一下下院中对于各种演说的反应，就会知道，一个代表大的工会或者其选区正发生斗争的议员，比起一个没有群众支持的议员来，更受人注意。这就是为什么身为一个大工会的中央组织者休依森攻击克利浦斯的预算时，有那样的作用，为什么在码头工人罢工时，梅里西先生特别受人注意的缘故。所有的共产党员都必须了解这点，特别是那些在其所属工会中有影响的党员。因为向有组织的工人阶级解释这点是极端必要的；向他们指明真正的力量所在，以及他们要怎样才能够击败现政府的政策并实现他们所热切希望之改变。不能做到这点，就是表示，群众将继续为国会“民主”所统治，而这种“民主”，像泰晤士报新近所指出的，只有在政府和反对党之间基本上是一致的、即接受资本主义制度的情形下，才能在其现在的基础上继续下去。
    如果我们把群众运动看作我们推进阶级斗争的工作的基础，如果我们从这个角度来看国会工作，那末国会活动和国会选举就得到了恰如其分的估计，而我们就能够确当地了解这种活动的形式对我们总的运动的意义所在。
    让我们清楚而明确。例如，我们在下一次选举中的目标就是击败保守党的资本主义力量；暴露右翼工党领袖，争取尽可能多的共产党员当选，使得我们在国会内外的战斗的力量加强起来。最要紧的是，在提出这些目标时，我们整个政策必须证明并看作是脱出右翼工党领袖的为保守党所统治的政策的道路。
    在这方面，我们听到有人在批评。有一种说法就是这些目标相互矛盾。他们说，在目前，舍保守党而外就是工党，所以我们只应该占一些有名无实的席位，以免危及工党的胜利。另一种说法的理由恰恰相反。他们说，既然保守党和工党都实行同样的进攻工人阶级和支持资本主义的政策，我们就应该两者都不支持，并且应该不参加选举。这样，我们就达到了这样的情形，即双方都要求党在选举中完全不要起什么重大作用，而采取消极的态度，劝工人阶级不要参加投票。简言之，就是我们恰恰在国家政治生活达到高潮的时候放弃领导。
    这些同志难道不是忽视党的作用，忽视长远的展望和目前形势的需要，忽视工人阶级正在发展的行动以及他们正需要强有力的战斗的领导吗？这些同志难道不是把保守党和整个工党运动混为一谈，不是忽视工党的群众是可以争取过来的，工党的右翼的地位并非固若金汤，并且他们和他们的政策还是可以击败的吗？不参加的办法若要见效，必须有巨大的规模。如果我们有那样大的影响并且能够使大量工人群众不参加，那末显然我们就应该置力于选举，在我们拥有这种巨大群众影响的地区进行竞选。这将是转消极办法为非常积极的行动。提出这种意见的人没有看到这种建议的积极方面，证明他们的看法受到了当前困难的影响。
    我们正进入一个对工人阶级的进攻与日俱增的时期。前面还有剧烈的斗争，所以显然我们的党必须挺身而出，领导起工人阶级的斗争。我们的党必须证明自己与工党不同，乃是工人阶级及其生活的保卫者，是社会主义的战士，不为工党领袖右翼政策所玷污和损害。
    工人对于右翼政策的失望正愈来愈大，特别是在工业地区，而且不顾反共宣传的洪流，工人们愈来愈愿意倾听我们的道理了。工人阶级正从它亲身经验认识到，现政府的右翼政策的结果是什么，但是工人之是否正确地学到了这个教训，取决于我们的党，取决于他们是否认为我们比工党好；是否他们认为我们是认真的政治力量——而工人认为一个党是否认真，常常是依据这个党的选举工作。你们那一个没有听到过真诚的工人们都说我们共产党是一批好人，但是，我们在下院只有两个议员，又能作什么呢？
    不管我们如何感慨，事实仍是千百万真诚的工人把国会及国会代表权看作决定一个政党是否是认真的主要因素。如果在现在这样的时候，工人阶级开始进入行动，国家政治生活达于高潮，各界人民都在讨论和比较各种纲领与政策的时候，我们只推出寥寥无几的候选人参加这次竞选，我们怎么能够起影响，我们的政策人家怎么会了解呢？工人们会怎样看我们呢？如果相反，我们在一切可能的地方都推出候选人参加竞选，我们的话就可以传达到成百万的人。如果我们这样做，并且在我们不能推出候选人竞选的地方，独立地进行选举运动，那末，我们的纲领和政策就会传到我们党很少进去过的地方。我们的好的政策就会摆到人民的面前，而我们反对资本主义、争取社会主义的斗争，就会帮助重新鼓舞起许多由于右翼宣传和工党政府的政策而感到迷惑的工人。
    因此，国会工作是与阶级斗争分不开的。这个问题的处理，必须像我们处理一切问题一样——就是，领导工人阶级，为工人阶级而斗争。这是我们工作的一方面，是党的总的工作的一个配合部分，不是与之分离，而是帮助推进我们工业方面的或其他的活动，正如这些活动反过来也帮助推进我们的选举和国会工作。
