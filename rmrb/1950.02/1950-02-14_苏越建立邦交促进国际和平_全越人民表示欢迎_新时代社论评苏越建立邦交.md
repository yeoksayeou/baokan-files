Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 13th. TASS, Moscow, 10th: The "New Era" magazine published an editorial entitled "The Soviet Union and Vietnam," stating that imperialists are issuing furious cries and arbitrarily fabricating endless slanders regarding the establishment of diplomatic relations between the Soviet Union and the Democratic Republic of Vietnam.

    The editorial pointed out that the government led by President Ho Chi Minh is the only legitimate government in Vietnam, representing all the Vietnamese people. The Soviet government's decision to establish diplomatic relations with the Democratic Republic of Vietnam is due to the Soviet Union's respect for the independence of other countries, which is a basic principle of Stalin's foreign policy. This action by the Soviet Union is in line with the spirit and principles of the United Nations Charter.

    The "New Era" editorial emphasized that after the imperialists' attempt to crush the Democratic Republic of Vietnam with military force failed, they are now attempting to prop up a puppet government in the occupied areas of Vietnam, headed by the former Annam King Bao Dai. However, the small number of reactionary elements employed by the imperialists are incapable of completing the tasks given to them by their masters. The reason the imperialists are showing fury is precisely because their policies in Asia have suffered setbacks and failures, especially because of the collapse of their plan in Vietnam.

    The editorial concluded: The Vietnamese people welcome the establishment of diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union. The establishment of diplomatic relations between the Soviet Union and Vietnam is a new contribution to promoting international peace and friendship.

    新时代社论评苏越建立邦交
    【新华社北京十三日电】据塔斯社莫斯科十日讯：新时代杂志以《苏联和越南》为题发表社论称：帝国主义者对苏联与越南民主共和国建立外交关系一事，发出暴怒的叫嚣，并任意捏造无休止的诽谤。
    社论指出：胡志明主席所领导的政府，是越南唯一合法的政府，代表全体越南人民。苏联政府决定与越南民主共和国建立外交关系，是由于苏联尊重其他国家的独立，这是斯大林外交政策的基本原则。苏联的这一行动，是符合联合国宪章的精神和原则的。
    新时代社论着重指出：帝国主义者在他们以军事力量粉碎越南民主共和国的企图失败之后，现在企图在越南占领区扶植一个以前安南王保大为首的傀儡政府。但是，少数帝国主义者所雇佣的反动分子，是无能完成他们主子给他们的任务的。帝国主义者之所以表现狂怒，正是因为他们在亚洲的政策受到了挫折和失败，特别是因为在越南计划的崩溃。
    社论结语称：越南人民欢迎与苏联建立外交关系。苏越建立邦交是促进国际和平与友谊的新贡献。
