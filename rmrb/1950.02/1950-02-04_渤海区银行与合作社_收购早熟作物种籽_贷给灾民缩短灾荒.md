The People's Bank of the Bohai Region and the Cooperative Promotion General Office are acquiring early-maturing seeds to lend to farmers so they can plant early-maturing crops and vegetables in the spring, thereby preventing the prolongation of the famine. In order to ensure the successful completion of the lending work, the bank has specified two lending methods: one is that the bank directly provides farmers with grain, and then goes to the Promotion Agency to exchange it for seeds; the other is to purchase seeds through the Promotion Agency and cooperatives to lend to farmers. The Bohai Branch has now allocated 800,000 jin of grain to various counties for lending. Among them, the Kenli area needs a total of 280,000 jin of early-maturing seeds. In addition to the existing 140,000 jin of barley and pea seeds, and the ones purchased from various places through cooperatives, there are a total of more than 170,000 jin. The loan of grain and preparation of seeds in other areas are also in progress. The Cooperative Promotion General Office has a detailed plan for cooperating with the bank to lend and purchase seeds, and has started purchasing. It has already purchased more than 100,000 jin of barley seeds in Guangrao, Huantai, Shouguang and other places. In addition, half of the 360,000 jin of wheat seeds that the Kenli Tractor Farm and the Supply Department of the Military Region Command entrusted the agency to purchase have also been purchased. At present, banks, promotion agencies, and cooperatives at all levels in the Bohai Region are stepping up purchases in various places in order to prepare seeds for lending to farmers before the thaw.
