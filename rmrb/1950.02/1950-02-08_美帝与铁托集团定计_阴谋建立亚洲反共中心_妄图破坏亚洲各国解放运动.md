Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, February 6th: According to a report from the Telegraph Agency in Bucharest on the 3rd, the latest issue of the organ of the Communist Information Bureau published two articles exposing that after the repeated failures of the plots of the Anglo-American imperialists and the Tito clique in Eastern Europe, they are attempting to use this loyal running dog group to carry out conspiracies in Asian countries and other parts of the world.

　　The publication pointed out in a special article: Washington and Belgrade have formulated a plan to establish a Yugoslav anti-communist center in New Delhi, the capital of India, to oppose the communists in India, Vietnam, Malaya, Indonesia, Japan and other Asian countries. This anti-communist center, located in the Yugoslav embassy in Delhi, will collect wavering elements and traitors to engage in fascist propaganda and anti-Soviet propaganda, and use the Yugoslav embassies and legations in other Asian countries as branches for launching attacks on the communist parties and national liberation movements of various countries, and as headquarters for placing their running dogs in these regions.

　　The Information Bureau publication also published an article by Dolores Ibárruri, General Secretary of the Communist Party of Spain, in which she exposed Tito's connection with the Spanish Republican government-in-exile after exposing Tito's connection with Franco. The article pointed out that the recent awarding of medals by the Spanish Republican government to Tito elements will be used for propaganda in Yugoslavia, and as a means for them to break into the ranks of Spanish guerrillas and exiles.

　　美帝与铁托集团定计
    阴谋建立亚洲反共中心
    妄图破坏亚洲各国解放运动
    【新华社北京六日电】据电通社布加勒斯特三日讯：共产党情报局机关报最新一期刊载了两篇文章，揭露美英帝国主义者于铁托集团在东欧的阴谋活动一再失败之后，正企图利用这一忠实走狗集团在亚洲各国及世界其他地方进行阴谋活动。
    该刊在一篇专文中指出：华盛顿与贝尔格莱德已制订了一个计划，要在印度首都德里建立南斯拉夫反共中心，以反对印度、越南、马来亚、印尼、日本及其他亚洲国家的共产党。这个设于德里南斯拉夫大使馆的反共中心，将收罗动摇分子与叛徒，从事法西斯宣传与反苏宣传，并利用南斯拉夫驻亚洲其他国家的大使馆与公使馆，充当对各国共产党与民族解放运动发动进攻的支部及将其走狗安插在这些地区的总部。
    情报局刊物同时刊载西班牙共产党总书记伊巴露丽的文章，她在戳穿了铁托与佛朗哥的联系之后，揭露铁托与西班牙共和流亡政府的联系。该文指出西班牙共和政府最近授勋给铁托分子一事，将被利用在南斯拉夫进行宣传，并以此作为手段，使他们能打进西班牙游击队与流亡者的队伍中。
