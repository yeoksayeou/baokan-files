Xinhua News Agency, Dihua, 4th—The Xinjiang Military Region of the People's Liberation Army has recently issued an order regarding the participation of all troops in production. The order stipulates: (1) All military personnel must participate in labor production. Even those who cannot fully participate in labor due to office duties must participate in growing vegetables in their own units. No military personnel should stand outside the battlefront of labor production and construction. (2) All units in Xinjiang, except those responsible for border defense and urban garrison duties, the motor transport corps, mule, horse, or camel transport units, and employees of military factories, must mobilize 110,000 people to the agricultural production battlefront. Their tasks are: (1) To cultivate 40,000 hectares of land (15 *hua* *mu* per hectare, totaling 600,000 *mu*), of which 36,000 hectares will be used to grow grain, and 4,000 hectares will be used to grow cotton (the 20,000 hectares of winter wheat sown last autumn are not included in this number). The grain yield per hectare should be no less than the value of 15 *gongdan* of wheat, and the cotton yield should be 15 *gongdan* of seed cotton per hectare. (2) To contract for water conservancy projects and complete irrigation for 100,000 hectares within two years. (3) In addition to purchasing 18,000 double-horse plows, 50,000 *kantu man*, and 5,000 iron hooks from the Soviet Union, each unit will prepare the remaining farm tools themselves. (4) 100,000 kilograms of cotton seeds will be purchased from the Soviet Union, and grain seeds will be paid for from food rations, with actual expenses reimbursed. The order requests that all units formulate their own production plans as soon as possible, and that they can launch production competitions with each other in the spirit of mutual assistance. Leading cadres of the Military Region must go to various places to inspect after production begins.

Xinhua News Agency, Kashi, Xinjiang, 2nd—A certain division of the First Field Army, after a combat march of more than 11,000 *li* from Shaanxi, arrived in Kashi on November 26th last year and immediately began political rectification and production construction. Kashi (the combined name of Shule and Shufu) is located below the Pamir Plateau. The surrounding areas are sparsely populated, houses are extremely scarce, and some places have nothing but desert. The troops lacked daily necessities and production tools besides their marching pots due to the long-distance combat. In view of the above situation, the leaders of the troops immediately called on everyone to "overcome difficulties by working together." On the second day after arriving in Kashi, all commanders and fighters began building revolutionary homes. In more than 20 days, each unit made many daily necessities and production tools, and built more than 700 houses. Each battalion built classrooms, playgrounds, and sports equipment such as vaulting horses and parallel bars. A large number of construction talents emerged in each unit. For example, a certain regiment discovered 206 skilled workers in more than 30 crafts such as carpentry, ironwork, and stonework. The production movement also unfolded universally. In 20 days, the entire division accumulated more than 17,000 baskets of fertilizer. Every morning at the first crow of the rooster, soldiers went out in groups of three or five to collect fertilizer. Eighteen of the thirty-two mess units in a certain regiment raised livestock such as pigs and sheep. Soldiers seized spare time to blacksmith, make tools, and spin wool. Hundreds and thousands of soldiers went dozens of *li* away to carry firewood, and female comrades actively participated in carrying firewood and collecting fertilizer. Each unit began irrigating fields in preparation for spring plowing, and a certain regiment has already irrigated more than 1,000 *mu* of land. A certain regiment mined more than 23,000 *jin* of salt in Gashi County. In labor production, cadres and Communist Party members took the lead. Cadres at all levels personally carried bricks, dug soil, and collected fertilizer. Each unit established a production labor committee, absorbing cadres and soldiers with technical skills and experience to participate, and using them as the core to "teach apprentices." People with basket-weaving skills in a certain regiment taught many apprentices, and wove nearly 700 baskets in 20 days. In addition to planning military education, the staff members were divided into three groups: water conservancy, tools, and industry, to take charge of the entire production and construction work. Soldiers of a certain regiment wrote on the wall newspaper: "We are from the laboring people. With our own two hands, we will have everything." The uprising troops and the Uyghur compatriots all expressed infinite admiration for the PLA's enthusiasm for labor and its spirit of overcoming difficulties.

　　新疆军区发出
    全军参加生产命令
    某部经过连续作战万里行军即进行生产建设
    【新华社迪化四日电】人民解放军新疆军区顷发布关于全军参加生产的命令，其中规定：（一）全体军人一律参加劳动生产，即使因机关业务关系不能全部参加劳动生产者，亦得自己动手参加本单位种菜，不得有任何军人站在劳动生产建设战线之外。（二）全新疆部队除担任边防警卫和城市卫戍勤务、辎重汽车兵团、骡马或骆驼运输等部队及军工部工厂职工外，必须发动十一万人到农业生产战线上去。其任务为：（１）垦耕土地四万公顷（每公顷十五华亩，共六十万亩），其中三万六千公顷土地种粮食，四千公顷种棉花（今秋播种的冬麦两万公顷不在此数内），每公顷粮食收获量以不少于十五公担麦子的价值，棉花每公顷十五公担籽花。（２）承包兴修水利，两年内完成十万公顷水利灌溉。（三）除由苏联购买双马轺犁一万八千个、砍土镘五万把、铁钩五千个外，其余农具均由各部自行准备。（四）棉种由苏联购买十万公斤，粮食种籽则由食粮中开支，准予实报实销。命令前后要求全军各部早日订出自己的生产计划，在互助的精神下，各部可相互发动生产竞赛运动。军区各首长须于生产开始后分赴各地检查。
    【新华社新疆喀什二日电】第一野战军某师由陕西经一万一千余里的作战行军，于去年十一月二十六日抵达喀什城后，即开始进行政治整训，同时进行生产建设。喀什城（疏勒、疏附合称）在帕米尔高原之下，附近地区人烟稀少，房屋极为缺乏，有些地方除沙漠外一无所有，而部队因为远程作战除了行军锅以外，其他生活用具和生产工具都极缺乏。部队负责人鉴于上述情况，当即号召“大家动手克服困难”。部队在抵喀什的第二天，全体指战员就开始建设革命家务。二十多天中各部制成了很多的日常生活用具和生产工具，修建了七百多间房屋，每个营都修建了课堂、操场和木马、杠架等运动器具。各单位涌现出大批的建设人才，如某团发现了木工、铁工、石工等三十多种工艺人才二百零六人。生产运动也普遍展开，二十天内全师积肥一万七千余筐；每天清晨鸡叫第一遍，战士们就三五成群出外拾肥。某团三十二个伙食单位有十八个单位养了猪、羊等家畜。战士们抓紧空隙时间打铁、做工具、捻毛线，成千成百的战士到几十里以外去背柴，女同志也积极参加背柴、拾肥的工作。各单位开始了灌溉田地的工作，准备春耕，某团已浇地达千余亩。某团在伽师县挖食盐二万三千余斤。在劳动生产中，干部和共产党员都起了带头作用，各级干部都亲自背砖，挖土，拾肥。各单位成立了生产劳动委员会，吸收有技术有经验的干部和战士参加，并以他们作核心来“教徒弟”。某团有编筐技术的人教出了很多徒弟，在二十天中编了近七百个的筐子。参谋人员除计划军事教育外，分成水利、工具、工业等三个组，掌握整个的生产建设工作。某团战士在墙报上写着：“我们是劳动人民出身，靠着两只手，什么都会有。”起义部队和维吾尔族同胞，对解放军的劳动热忱和克服困难的精神无不表示无限钦佩。
