　　Attack Taiwan, Capture Chiang Kai-shek Alive!
    Avenge Our Compatriots Who Died!
    The Remaining Bandits' Inhuman Frenzy Bombs Shanghai, Killing and Wounding Over a Thousand Residents
    [Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 7th] The Kuomintang bandit gang, devoid of humanity, frantically bombed Shanghai on the 6th, killing and wounding over a thousand residents. From 12:00 to 2:00 PM yesterday, seventeen American-made Kuomintang bandit aircraft in total, including twelve B-24s, two P-51s, two B-25s, and one P-38, invaded Shanghai's airspace in four batches, dropping over seventy bombs, causing serious losses to the lives and property of the citizens. According to preliminary statistics, over a thousand civilian houses were destroyed, and over a thousand residents were killed or wounded. In the Lujiawan district alone, over two hundred residents were killed and four hundred wounded; some entire families were tragically bombed to death. The American-owned power company was also damaged by the bombing, causing a temporary suspension of electricity and tap water throughout the city. The six million people of Shanghai are gnashing their teeth in hatred at Chiang Kai-shek's bandit gang's bloody atrocities and unanimously express their resolute support for the People's Liberation Army to swiftly attack Taiwan, capture Chiang Kai-shek alive, and avenge the deaths of our compatriots. The Municipal Government, Public Security Bureau, Garrison Headquarters, and the takeover committees and fire departments of the affected districts immediately mobilized to rescue the residents in distress when the enemy planes wreaked havoc. All public and private hospitals in the city provided overnight rescue. During the air raid, workers in various industries organized picket teams to patrol key transportation routes and maintain order.
