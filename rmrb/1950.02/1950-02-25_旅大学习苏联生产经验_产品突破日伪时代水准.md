Xinhua News Agency, Dalian, 23rd – As a result of accepting advanced Soviet production experience, the quality and quantity of many industrial products in the Lüda area have greatly surpassed the level of the Japanese occupation era. Last year, the production volume of the Dalian Glass Factory exceeded the highest production volume during the Japanese occupation by 233%; and by adopting Soviet experience, the annual repair time for the glass furnace was reduced from 96 days during the Japanese occupation to only 33 days. Thanks to the adoption of new Soviet shipbuilding methods at the Dalian Ship Repair and Shipbuilding Factory, the efficiency of manufacturing a small electric boat hull is now 70 times higher than during the Japanese occupation with the same number of people and working conditions; ship repair efficiency is also nine times higher than during the Japanese occupation; and the quality of rivets has improved from one leak per 100 to only one leak per 1,000. More importantly, with the help of Soviet experts, Lüda has changed the colonial industrial system of only processing and repairing during the Japanese imperialist era. For example, the large-scale Dalian Railway Factory was previously unable to manufacture the most precise parts of passenger car braking devices, but now it is able to manufacture them independently. Although the Dalian Ship Repair and Shipbuilding Factory was able to build ships of very large tonnage in the past, it could not manufacture the main machinery on the ships, but now the technical difficulties in manufacturing have been solved.
　　
Cadres and workers in Dalian enterprises have been conducting planned and organized studies to learn and master Soviet production technology and enterprise management experience. Many Sino-Soviet joint venture departments have adopted the method of setting up deputy positions to cultivate the management capabilities of Chinese personnel. Methods such as masters teaching apprentices, masters and apprentices signing learning contracts, and on-the-job cadres conducting technical and business studies have also been adopted in various enterprises. These are mostly experiences in training cadres during the recovery of industrial production after the October Revolution in the Soviet Union. The China Changchun Railway Factory now has more than 1,900 workers who have been promoted due to improved skills. Soviet experts mainly train Chinese technical cadres by inspiring them to use their own brains and do it with their own hands. For example, in the rationalization proposal "technical bounty" project of the Dalian Railway Factory, some issues had already been resolved in Soviet production, but Soviet experts raised them and helped workers and cadres solve them themselves under the existing material basis and technical conditions in Lüda. On each topic, Soviet experts did not point out specific solutions, but clearly pointed out the direction so as to guide the workers' thinking in the right direction.

　　旅大学习苏联生产经验  产品突破日伪时代水准
    【新华社大连二十三日电】旅大地区由于接受苏联先进的生产经验的结果，现在许多工业产品的质量和数量都大大突破了日寇时代的水准。去年大连玻璃工厂生产量超过日寇时代最高产量的百分之二百三十三；并且接受苏联经验，将玻璃大窑每年一次的修理时间由日寇时代的九十六天降到只用三十三天。大连修船造船工厂由于采用了苏联的新式造船法，现在制造一只小电船壳的效率，较日寇时期在同样的人数和工作条件下提高了七十倍；修船的效率亦较日寇时代提高了九倍；铆铆钉的质量由过去一百个中有一个漏水的提高到现在一千个中仅有一个。尤其重要的是在苏联专家们的帮助下，旅大已改变了在日本帝国主义时的只能加工修理的殖民地型工业体系。如规模宏大的大连铁路工厂，过去不能制造最精密部分的客车掣动装置，现在已能够独立制造了。过去大连修船造船工厂虽能造吨位很大的船只，但船上的主要机械却不能制造，现在也解决了制造技术上的困难。
    大连各企业干部和职工，为学会并掌握苏联的生产技术和管理企业的经验，曾有计划有组织地进行学习。许多中苏合营的企业部门中采用了设副职的办法，以培养中国人员的管理能力。在各企业中还采用了师傅带徒弟、师徒订学习合同、在职干部进行技术业务学习等办法。这些也多是苏联十月革命后恢复工业生产中培养干部的经验。中长铁路工厂现已有一千九百多名工人因技术提高升了级。苏联专家们培养中国技术干部主要是通过启发他们自己开动脑筋，用自己的手做出来。如大连铁路工厂合理化建议的“技术悬赏”的课题中，有些是在苏联生产中早已解决了的，但苏联专家却把它提出来在旅大现有物质基础与技术条件下启发与帮助工人和干部自己解决。在每一条课题上，苏联专家当然不指出解决的具体办法，但却明确地指出了方向，以便把工人的思路引导到正确方向。
