Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 3rd. The South Korean Labor News published the following comprehensive results of the South Korean People's Guerrilla forces for December of last year: In December, the South Korean People's Guerrillas and the broad masses of uprising peasants who opposed "conscription," "grain requisition," and fought for land reform, established close ties and shattered the Lee Seung-man gang's so-called "year-end suppression plan." In the biting cold of December, the People's Guerrillas fought against puppet troops and police 660 times in various regions of South Korea, mobilizing 44,232 people, attacking 12 puppet military and police barracks and police substations, eliminating a total of 1,993 puppet military, police, secret agents, and local bullies, annihilating 570 puppet military police, capturing 121, and eliminating 858 puppet "National Defense Forces," "Civil Defense Corps," "Great Korean Youth Corps," and reactionary landlords, capturing 444 alive, and seizing a total of 477 machine guns, rifles, and other weapons. Together with the uprising peasants, the People's Guerrillas recovered 5,460 dou of grain and 2,225,770 won in cash from secret agents and reactionary landlords. While fighting, the guerrillas widely carried out propaganda and mobilization work, distributing more than 400,000 leaflets exposing the essence of the Lee Seung-man gang's so-called "surrender and return to righteousness movement."
    In December, peasants in various regions of South Korea responded to the call of the peasants in the Munsu District of Yeongju County, North Gyeongsang Province, on December 8 to support the guerrillas, widely organizing "Committees to Support the Guerrillas," disregarding the enemy's cruel suppression, and providing the People's Guerrillas with large quantities of food, clothing, and shoes. In more than 120 regions, more than 170 mass meetings were held.
