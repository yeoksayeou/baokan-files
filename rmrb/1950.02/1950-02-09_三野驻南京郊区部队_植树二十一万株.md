Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, 6th – Troops of the Third Field Army stationed in the suburbs of Nanjing have launched a winter tree-planting campaign in the vicinity of their garrisons. Since late December of last year, the unit has planted over 218,400 saplings of various kinds on the hillsides and along the roads near their stations. It is expected that the area will become a green expanse by the time spring arrives. During the planting process, the commanders and soldiers of the unit all recognized this as a labor construction project concerning the long-term interests of the people's motherland. Therefore, they earnestly consulted experienced agricultural planters and hired forestry farm agricultural technicians to provide on-site planting guidance. After completing the planting work, the troops also inserted withered branches around the saplings, surrounded them with broken bricks, hung wooden signs reading "Protect the Saplings," and assigned each planting unit to take charge of protection.

　　三野驻南京郊区部队
    植树二十一万株
    【新华社南京六日电】人民解放军第三野战军驻南京市郊某部在驻地附近展开冬季植树运动。自去年十二月下旬以来，该部分别在驻地附近的山坡上、公路旁植下各种苗木二十一万八千四百余株；预计至春暖季节该地区将成为一片绿野。在栽植过程中，该部指战员均认识到这是有关人民祖国长远利益的劳动建设，因此曾认真请教有经验的农植家，并聘请林场农植技师实地指导栽植。在完成栽植工作后，部队又在树苗四周插上枯枝，用碎砖围起来，挂上“爱护树苗”的木牌，并由各栽植单位分工保护。
