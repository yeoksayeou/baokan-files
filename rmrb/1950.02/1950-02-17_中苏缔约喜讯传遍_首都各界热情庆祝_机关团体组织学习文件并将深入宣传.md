    [Our Newspaper's Report] All circles in the capital continue to warmly celebrate and have begun to study and promote the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance and other agreements. Workers at the streetcar company's repair shop have started to build two floats, which are scheduled to run on the streets today (the 17th).
    After hearing the news, the staff and workers of the Beijing People's Printing Factory immediately held a celebration meeting. At the meeting, cadres and workers gave speeches one after another. The workers stated that they would not only celebrate in the form of meetings but also celebrate with practical actions to improve production and ensure the completion of tasks. The factory director also pledged to make the factory even better this year, not afraid of difficulties, and working diligently. When the Beijing Electric Power Bureau conveyed the contents of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance and other agreements at a gathering on the 15th, cheers and applause rang out continuously. When the Jingxi Coal Mine Company held a commendation meeting on the 15th, they heard the news of the Sino-Soviet treaty. At that time, more than 800 people all stood up and applauded and cheered. Liang Yongjie, a special model worker from the Heishan Mine electromechanical team, excitedly said: "1950 is a year of difficulties, but now with the help of the Soviet big brother, the difficulties in various constructions can certainly be overcome. Our production target for this year is 800,000 tons, and we will definitely strive to exceed it!"
