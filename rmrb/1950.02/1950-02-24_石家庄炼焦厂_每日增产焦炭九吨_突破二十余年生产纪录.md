　　Shijiazhuang Coking Plant
    Increases Daily Coke Production by Nine Tons
    Breaking Production Record of Over Twenty Years
    [This newspaper reports] The Shijiazhuang Coking Plant has broken its production record of over twenty years, producing two more coke ovens of coke per day, an increase of 9.1 tons, and the quality meets standards. Since the plant officially started producing coke in 1925, the twenty small ovens could usually only maintain fourteen or fifteen ovens. During the Japanese occupation, although sixteen ovens were produced, the quality was extremely poor, with a lot of raw coal that could not be coked. The ten large ovens were built and started producing coke in 1930, and production had never been increased. In the two years since liberation, after two large-scale production emulation campaigns and the factory management democratization movement, the workers' awareness has rapidly increased. In the third production emulation campaign last November, Sun Shujun, a fire-watching worker, proposed a production plan to produce one more small oven per day, which was immediately supported by all employees. After careful inspection and research by the factory and technicians, it was put into trial operation on November 10th last year. Thanks to the workers' high sense of responsibility and good control of the fire, and the appropriate adjustment of the flue draft and the pressure of gas entering the combustion chamber, the original temperature could be maintained even with the addition of one oven, allowing the experiment to succeed. The daily increase in coke production is 2.7 tons. This victory further boosted the production enthusiasm and confidence of all workers. At the third emulation campaign summary meeting, the factory administration proposed a requirement to strive for another large oven per day in 1950. After more than a month of careful research by all employees, and three special technical research meetings to exchange improvement opinions, a consensus was reached on ideology, technology, and action, and the experiment began on the 6th of this month. The boiler room ensured that the steam pressure remained uniform, reducing the coking (carbonization) time of all large ovens from twenty-four hours to twenty-two hours. The machine room increased the pulley of the line shaft, so that the increased gas could be delivered to the by-product collection device in time, so as not to "get stuck" due to the increase of gas in the furnace. The factory also reasonably adjusted the labor organization. After four days of experimentation, the results were good, with a daily increase of one large coke oven, a total of 6.4 tons, and the quality also met the standards. From then on, the plant increased from fifteen small ovens and ten large ovens per day for more than twenty years to sixteen small ovens and eleven large ovens, and the coke production increased from 104.5 tons to 113.6 tons. The plant is now working hard to shorten the coking time and further increase production.

### 石家庄炼焦厂  每日增产焦炭九吨  突破二十余年生产纪录

　　石家庄炼焦厂
    每日增产焦炭九吨
    突破二十余年生产纪录
    【本报讯】石家庄炼焦厂突破二十余年来的生产纪录，每日多出焦炭两炉，计增产焦炭九．一吨，且质量合乎标准。该厂自一九二五年正式出焦以来，二十个小炉通常只能保持出十四、五炉，日寇统治时期虽曾出过十六炉，但质量极坏，炼不成焦的生煤特多。十个大炉是一九三○年建立并开始出焦，从未增产过。解放两年多以来，经过两次大规模的生产竞赛运动及工厂管理民主化运动，工人阶级觉悟迅速提高。在去年十一月第三次生产竞赛中，看火工人孙树俊提出每日多出一小炉的生产计划，立即得到全体职工的拥护，并经厂方及技术人员周密检查研究后，于去年十一月十日开始试行。由于工人们发挥了高度责任心，很好的掌握住了火候，并将烟道吸力及煤气进燃烧室的压力加以适当调整，因而虽增加一炉，仍能保持原有的温度，得以试验成功。每日可增出焦炭二．七吨。这一胜利进一步鼓舞了全体工人的生产情绪和信心。在第三次竞赛总结大会上，该厂行政上提出一九五○年争取每日再增出一大炉的要求。全体职工经过月余来精细研究，并专门开过三次技术研究会交换改进意见，取得思想、技术和行动上的一致意见，于本月六日开始试验。锅炉房作到蒸气压力保持均匀，使全部大炉炼焦（炭化）时间由二十四小时缩短为二十二小时。机器房加大了天轴的皮带轮，使增加的煤气及时送到副产捕集装置内，不致因炉内煤气增多而“发蹩”。厂方并合理的调整了劳力组织。经过四天的试验，成绩良好，每日可增产焦炭一大炉，计六．四吨，质量也合乎标准。从此，该厂即由二十余年来日出十五小炉、十大炉增为十六小炉、十一大炉，产焦量则由一○四．五吨增为一一三．六吨。现该厂正为缩短炼焦时间进一步增加产量而努力。
