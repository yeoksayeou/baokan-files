　　Capital Workers Celebrate the Spring Festival and Do Not Forget Production
    Trolleys Run Continuously, with Ten More Added Daily
    [Beijing News] In addition to holding general get-togethers, Beijing workers will celebrate the first Spring Festival after liberation by increasing production and improving technology. During the Spring Festival, the trolley company's repair shop decided to run 97 trolleys daily from the 14th to the 21st, ten more than usual, in order to facilitate passengers. Originally, there was supposed to be a three-day holiday for the Spring Festival, but in order to ensure the running of the trolleys, the workers voluntarily arranged for half of each shift to come to work on the 17th and 18th (the first and second days of the lunar new year), and everyone will be back to work on the 20th. In order to respect teachers and cherish apprentices, improve production technology, and complete production tasks, the trade union of the water company decided to hold a Spring Festival gathering for young and old workers on the 20th, which will include entertainment programs, as well as speeches and talks by veteran and young workers.
    [Beijing News] The Capital Spring Festival Literary and Art Work Committee held a meeting on the 14th at the Literary and Art Section of the Bureau of Culture and Education to report on the arrangements for the Spring Festival literary and artistic activities. The meeting decided: (1) Each district should form a branch of the Spring Festival Literary and Art Work Committee, jointly with the Culture and Education Section and relevant departments, to specifically manage the indoor and outdoor Spring Festival literary and artistic activities in that district. (2) Literary and artistic programs automatically organized by citizens in each district should first be registered with the Culture and Education Section of the district government for guidance and assistance; literary and artistic activities organized by agencies, troops, organizations, schools, etc., stationed in each district should also contact the Culture and Education Section of the district government in order to unify the organization and exchange and summarize experiences.
