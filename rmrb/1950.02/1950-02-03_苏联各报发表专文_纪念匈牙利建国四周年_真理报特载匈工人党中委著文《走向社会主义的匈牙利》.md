Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, February 2nd: A comprehensive dispatch from TASS, Moscow: January 31st was the fourth anniversary of the founding of the Hungarian People's Republic, and Soviet newspapers all published commemorative articles.

　　The Pravda specially carried an article entitled "Hungary on the Road to Socialism" by Erzsébet Andics, a member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Hungarian Workers' Party, stating: "In the past four years, major achievements have been made in the development of our entire national economy. In the past less than two and a half years, the total industrial production has increased by 40 percent compared with 1938. The average agricultural production has reached the pre-war level and exceeded it in some aspects. In agriculture, the first batch of 220 machine and tractor stations has been established. Hundreds of new cultural palaces, clubs, schools, and research institutes have sprung up in cities and villages. Thanks to the help of the Soviet Union, the Hungarian people completed the three-year plan ahead of schedule and, on December 10th last year, adopted the 1950-1954 five-year plan, which aims to complete the task of rebuilding the entire national economy by strengthening and accelerating national industrialization. The completion of the five-year plan will lay the foundation for socialism in cities and villages."

　　Izvestia published an article by Halamov, stating: On the occasion of the fourth anniversary of the founding of the Hungarian People's Republic, the Soviet people congratulate the Hungarian people and wish them further victories on their road to socialism. The Hungarian people are constantly gaining new successes and effectively defending and consolidating their gains. For example: the single working-class party—the Hungarian Workers' Party—was formed in 1948; democratic forces won a major victory in the election of the National Assembly last spring; and the conspiracy of American spy Mindszenty was crushed, and the American-Yugoslav spy Rajk was exposed and purged. The Hungarian people are increasingly convinced that the only way for Hungary's rebirth and development is to build a new life without landlords and capitalists, and to maintain close alliance and friendship with the Soviet Union.
