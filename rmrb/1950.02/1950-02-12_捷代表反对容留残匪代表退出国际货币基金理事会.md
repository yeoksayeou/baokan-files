Xinhua News Agency, Washington, February 10th (TASS): At the February meeting of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) Board, Czechoslovak representative Sucharda proposed that the Board declare the qualifications of Kuomintang representatives in all IMF affiliated institutions as invalid. Sucharda pointed out that the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China had appointed Zhang Wentian as the chief representative to the United Nations, which is the best proof of the Chinese People's Government's sincerity in closely cooperating with the United Nations. The majority of the Board members refused to consider Sucharda's proposal. Sucharda then stated: As long as Kuomintang elements are allowed to participate in the various institutions affiliated with the IMF for even one more day, he will be unable to participate in any work of these institutions for even one day. (Note: The Soviet Union has never participated in the IMF organization from the beginning.)

　　捷代表反对容留残匪代表退出国际货币基金理事会
    【新华社北京十一日电】塔斯社华盛顿十日讯：在“国际货币基金”理事会二月份会议上，捷克斯拉夫代表苏察达提议，由理事会宣布国民党人在“国际货币基金”所属一切机构中的代表资格为无效。苏察达指出，中华人民共和国中央人民政府已委派张闻天为出席联合国的首席代表，这就是中国人民政府诚意与联合国密切合作的最好证明。理事会多数理事拒绝考虑苏察达的提议。苏察达于是声明：只要继续允许国民党人一天参加“国际货币基金”所属各机构，他就一天无法参加各机构的任何工作。（按苏联自始即未参加“国际货币基金”组织）
