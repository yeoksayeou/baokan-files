　　【Beijing News】The Beijing Municipal People's Court recently sentenced a fraud case. The main culprit, Ming Deguang, was sentenced to three years of imprisonment for repeated theft and fraud, as well as forging official documents, seals, and private chops. Ming Deguang was an unemployed vagrant. In July of last year, he tore off a corner of a "Beiping Municipal Eighth District People's Government" public notice posted on the wall that had a seal on it, forged a letter of introduction, and attempted to defraud banks and money shops in the Qianmen area. He was arrested by the Public Security Bureau and sent to the court. After a short period of education by the court, he was released on bail. However, Ming Deguang did not repent. When leaving the court's detention center, he even swindled the mattress of Peng Jixian, a fellow detainee. After being released, he continued to commit fraud and theft, and even privately carved a personal seal for He Zhanjun, a judge of the Beijing Municipal People's Court. He also purchased twelve lead characters such as "Beijing Municipal People's Court Adjudication Committee" and stole blank strips of paper bearing the long seal of the "Beiping Municipal Eighth District People's Government." In August, he impersonated a "cadre training class" staff member, falsely claimed to be introducing a job to citizen Xue Zenglu, and stole several pieces of his clothing while Xue was out. After the Municipal Public Security Bureau learned of Ming Deguang's behavior, they arrested him again and sent him to the court. The court sentenced him to three years of imprisonment on the grounds that the offender had not repented despite education.

    【北京讯】京市人民法院顷判决骗诈案一件，主犯明德光累次偷窃诈骗，并伪造公文、图记、私章，被判处徒刑三年。明德光是一个无业游民，去年七月他在珠市口把贴在墙上的“北平市第八区人民政府”布告中盖有印信的一角撕下，伪造介绍信一封，向前门一带银行钱庄行骗，被公安局逮捕送交法院，经该院予以短期教育后取保释放。但明德光仍不知悔改，在离开法院看守所时，竟又将同室押犯彭季先的褥子骗走。出所后仍然继续行骗偷窃，并曾私刻京市人民法院审判员贺战军私章一颗，购买“北京市人民法院审判委员会”等铅字十二个，偷得盖有“北平市第八区人民政府”长印的空白纸条等。八月间，他曾冒充“干训班”工作人员，诡称为市民薛增鲁介绍职业，乘薛外出之际，窃走其衣物多件。市公安局侦悉明德光此等行为后，遂又将其捕送法院。法院以该犯虽经教育仍不悔改，乃判以徒刑三年。
