Shanxi's Small and Medium Cities: Private Sector Industries
Universally Sign Labor-Management Collective Contracts
Labor-Management Disputes Decrease, Production Gradually Increases
[This News Report] According to the Shanxi Daily: Private enterprises in small and medium cities in Shanxi Province have universally signed labor-management collective contracts on an industry-wide basis. As a result, labor-management disputes have generally decreased, and production has gradually increased. Since the promulgation of the interim measures for labor and management to conclude collective contracts adopted by the National Trade Union Conference, the cotton weaving and machine iron industries in Taiyuan City, the cotton weaving industry in Yuci, Pingyao, and Xinjiang, and the carpentry and printed cloth industry in Changzhi have successively signed collective contracts, accounting for more than 90 percent of the province's private industrial households and more than 11 percent of the total number of employees. Before the signing of collective contracts, labor-management relations in various small and medium cities were extremely abnormal. For example, earthwork and carpentry workers in Taiyuan City were subject to exploitation by three to five layers of contractors. Female workers in the cotton weaving industry were dismissed when they gave birth. In the cotton weaving industry in Yuci and Pingyao, many problems existed between capitalists and workers that had not been resolved. As a result, there were many labor-management disputes in various places. According to statistics from Taiyuan City from May to October last year alone, nearly 50 major dispute cases were handled by the Municipal Labor Bureau, excluding those directly mediated by various district governments. Therefore, the provincial and municipal trade unions and labor bureaus, after accepting the experience of Beijing in concluding labor contracts, studied and promoted them in various places based on the interim measures promulgated by the National Trade Union Conference and combined with specific circumstances. Facts have proved that in all industries that have signed contracts, disputes have been greatly reduced, and production has been developed. For example, after the cotton weaving industry in Taiyuan City signed a contract on October 1 last year, the productivity of general workers has increased from 17 or 18 bolts of cloth per month in the past to 24 or 25 bolts of cloth.
From the work of signing collective contracts in various places, the following issues must be noted:
(1) Labor and management must fully deliberate and discuss before signing a contract. The signing of the labor-management contract in the private machine iron industry in Taiyuan City took more than two months of deliberation. First, the Municipal Labor Bureau and the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions and the preparatory committee of the Chamber of Commerce made specific inquiries about the production, operation, and development of the industry. After a period of publicity and deliberation, the two parties democratically elected representatives to conduct organized deliberation. However, after six or seven discussions, the opinions of labor and management on work, wages, and other issues were still far apart. The leadership immediately persuaded the representatives of both parties individually based on the policy, and then the two parties deliberated again. Finally, the two parties reached a satisfactory agreement, and after signing, they could voluntarily implement it. When the Yuci cotton weaving industry signed the contract for the first time, the cadres were eager to achieve results and took over the work. They read the contract clauses to the workers several times and signed it without extensive discussion. As a result, both labor and management were dissatisfied, and disputes continued to occur.
(2) The modification or abolition of the contract must be democratically negotiated by both parties. Since October last year, due to various reasons such as poor sales and the bank's recall of loans, the capital side of the Taiyuan cotton weaving industry insisted on reducing operations, resulting in labor-management disputes such as dismissal and wage reduction. After mediation by the Labor Bureau, the contract was modified within the validity period, and both parties were very satisfied.
(3) The rights and obligations of labor and management, as well as labor conditions, must be clearly stipulated in the collective contract.

　　山西各中小城市私营行业
    普遍签订劳资集体合同
    劳资纠纷减少各厂生产日渐提高
    【本报讯】据山西日报报导：山西省各中小城市私营企业，普遍以行业为单位签订劳资集体合同，因而劳资纠纷一般减少，生产逐渐提高。自全国工会会议通过劳资双方订立集体合同的暂行办法公布后，先后签订集体合同的有太原市的棉织及机器铁工业，榆次、平遥、新绛的棉织业，长治的木工及花布业等；占全省私营工业户的百分之九十以上，职工总数的百分之十一强。在签订集体合同以前，各中小城市的劳资关系极不正常。如太原市的土木工人，有的要受三、五层包工头的剥削；棉织行业的女工因生育即被解雇。在榆次和平遥等地棉织业中，资本家同工人之间存在许多问题没有解决，因之各地劳资纠纷极多，仅据太原市去年五月至十月份统计，除各区政府直接调处者外，经市劳动局处理之较大纠纷案件即近五十件之多。因此，省、市工会和劳动局接受北京订立劳资合同的经验，根据全国工会会议颁布之暂行办法，结合具体情况加以研究后，即在各地试行推广。事实证明：凡已签订合同的各行业中，纠纷大大减少，而且生产得到发展。如太原市棉织业于去年十月一日订立合同，一般工人的生产率已由过去月织十七、八匹布，增到了二十四、五匹布。
    从各地签订集体合同的工作来看，须注意以下几个问题：
    （一）劳资双方订立合同必须经过充分的酝酿和讨论。太原市私营机器铁工业劳资合同的签订，曾经过两个多月的酝酿。首先由市政府劳动局及市工会、同业公会筹委会对该行业生产经营及发展等情况进行了具体了解，经一度宣传酝酿后，便由双方民主选举代表进行有组织的酝酿，但经过六、七次的讨论，劳资双方在工作、工资等问题上意见仍距离尚远。领导上当即根据政策对两方代表进行个别说服，再由双方进行酝酿，最后双方达成完满协议，签字后也能自愿执行。榆次棉织业第一次签订合同时，由于干部急于求成、包办代替，将合同条例在工人中念了几遍，并未展开广泛讨论即签了字，结果劳资两方都不满意，纠纷仍然发生。
    （二）合同的修改或废止，须经双方民主协商。太原棉织业集体合同，自去年十月后，因销路不畅、银行收回贷款等种种原因，资方坚持缩小经营，因而发生解雇和减工资等劳资纠纷，后经劳动局调解，在有效期内进行了修改，双方都很满意。
    （三）在集体合同上，要明确规定劳资双方的权利义务、以及劳动条件。
