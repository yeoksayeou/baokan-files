　　National Railway Employees Basically Organized
    Union Membership Reaches 320,000
    Accounting for 78 Percent of All Railway Employees
    [This newspaper reports] Since the establishment of the Preparatory Committee of the All-China Railway Federation of Trade Unions in July last year, under the correct leadership of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, railway workers across the country have overcome the closed-doorism prevalent in trade union organizational work, correctly developed membership, and achieved remarkable results. The trade unions affiliated with the Preparatory Committee of the All-China Railway Federation of Trade Unions now include one Northeast General Branch, eleven District Trade Unions (railway bureau level), one directly subordinate trade union, thirty-four Zonal Trade Unions (railway sub-bureau level), forty-four District Trade Union Offices (sub-bureau level), one thousand and ninety-two basic-level trade unions (station and section), one thousand one hundred and twenty-four "central groups," and nineteen thousand six hundred and twenty-two member groups (lacking figures for Zhengzhou, Shanghai, and Hengyang districts). The participating membership has reached over 320,000, accounting for 78.1 percent of all employees. If the newly liberated areas such as Hengyang are not included, it accounts for 86.5 percent of all employees. Railway employees across the country have basically been organized. The Northeast Railway Union membership accounts for over 90 percent of the number of Northeast Railway employees. The membership of railway unions within the customs also reaches 69.2 percent of the number of employees; among them, the Tianjin District Railway Union has the largest number of members within the customs, accounting for 93.33 percent of the 41,966 employees in the Tianjin District; the Hengyang District Union has the fewest members, accounting for 17 percent of the 50,000 employees. The railways in the Hengyang District are mostly newly liberated, and trade union work has only recently begun, so the union membership is relatively small.
    In the early stage of developing union membership, railway unions in various regions experienced serious closed-doorism. Taking the situation of railway unions within the customs as an example, before September last year, the number of union members only accounted for 58.29 percent of the employees. The occurrence of this situation was mainly because the comrades in trade union work did not understand the basic nature of trade unions as mass organizations of the working class. Therefore, they set overly high conditions when developing membership. Before June last year, the Jinan District Railway Union was always afraid that employees who had joined the Kuomintang and the Three People's Principles Youth League would enter the union and cause trouble, and they did not know that the vast majority of the working class is good – the so-called secret agents are only an extremely small minority. Therefore, they did not dare to universally develop membership before June last year. Although the Jinan District Railway was liberated earlier, the number of union members before June last year only accounted for 18.3 percent of the employees. Individual unions in Zhengzhou District developed members with conditions such as "clean history, correct style, progressive thinking, and active work." As a result, the members they developed before June last year only accounted for 13.95 percent of all employees. The Preparatory Committee of the All-China Railway Federation of Trade Unions discovered this closed-doorism and corrected it in a timely manner; the National Trade Union Work Conference convened by the All-China Federation of Trade Unions also pointed out that this tendency must be vigorously corrected. Railway unions in various regions gradually developed correctly, and closed-doorism has now been basically overcome. However, the unions in individual regions, such as the Zhengzhou District Union, still only have 24,416 members, accounting for only 61.4 percent of all employees, which is not right.

　　全国铁路员工基本上组织起来
    工会会员达三十二万
    占全体铁路员工百分之七十八
    【本报讯】全国铁路工人自去年七月成立中华全国铁路总工会筹备委员会以来，在中华全国总工会的正确领导下，克服工会组织工作上普遍存在的关门主义偏向，正确地发展会员，获得了显著的成绩。中华全国铁路总工会筹备委员会所属工会，已有东北总分会一个，区工会十一个（铁路管理局级）直属工会一个，分区工会三十四个（铁路分局级），区工会办事处四十四个（分局级），基层工会（站段）一千零九十二个，“中心小组”一千一百二十四个，会员小组（缺郑州、上海、衡阳三区数目）一万九千六百二十二个，参加的会员已达三十二万余人，占全体员工百分之七十八点一。若不包括衡阳等新近解放地区在内，则占全体员工百分之八十六点五，全国铁路员工已经基本上组织起来了。东北铁路工会会员则占东北铁路员工人数的百分之九十多。关内铁路工会会员亦达员工人数的百分之六十九点二；其中天津区铁路工会会员人数为关内最多者，占天津区全体员工四万一千九百六十六名的百分之九十三点三三；衡阳区工会会员最少，占全体员工五万人的百分之十七。衡阳区铁路多系新近解放的，工会工作开始不久，所以工会会员较少。
    在发展工会会员初期，各地区铁路工会曾严重的发生过关门主义偏向。以关内铁路工会情况来说，去年九月以前，工会会员人数只占员工的百分之五十八点二九。这种情况的发生，主要是由于工会工作同志不明白工会为工人阶级的群众组织的基本性质，因此在发展会员时订出过高的条件。济南区铁路工会在去年六月以前，一直害怕参加过国民党、三青团的职工进入工会捣乱，不知道工人阶级绝大多数是好的——所谓特务分子仅是极其个别的少数，因此他们在去年六月前不敢普遍地发展会员，虽然济南区铁路解放较早，而他们在去年六月份以前的工会会员人数仅占员工的百分之十八点三。郑州区个别工会则以“历史清白、作风正派、思想进步、工作积极”等条件发展会员，结果他们在去年六月份以前所发展的会员仅为全体员工的百分之十三点九五。中华全国铁路总工会筹备委员会发现这种关门主义偏向，曾及时纠正；中华全国总工会所召开的全国工会工作会议亦曾指出这种偏向须大力予以纠正，各地铁路工会始渐正确的向前发展，目前已基本上克服了关门主义偏向。但个别地区的工会如郑州区工会，会员至今仅有二万四千四百十六名，只占全体员工的百分之六十一点四，这是不应该的。
