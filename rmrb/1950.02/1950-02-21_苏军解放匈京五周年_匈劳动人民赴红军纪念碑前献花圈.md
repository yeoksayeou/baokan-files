　　Soviet Army's Liberation of Budapest Fifth Anniversary
    Hungarian Working People Lay Wreaths at the Red Army Memorial

    [Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, February 14th] Comprehensive TASS report: On the 13th, the Hungarian working people warmly celebrated the fifth anniversary of the Soviet Army's liberation of Budapest. The people of Budapest lined up to lay wreaths at the Soviet Red Army Memorial. Hungarian newspapers all published special articles to commemorate the event.

    The Soviet Red Star newspaper published an article by Korneev commemorating the event, stating: When the Soviet Army liberated Budapest five years ago, Hitler's bandits almost destroyed three-quarters of the city's industrial buildings and residences, and blew up all eight bridges on the Danube River. Under the leadership of the Hungarian Workers' Party, the Hungarian working people rebuilt Budapest, repaired every bridge on the Danube River, restored the damaged enterprises, and expanded them. Now, there are few traces of destruction in Budapest.

    The living standards of the capital's people have significantly improved. In 1949, after the abolition of the rationing system, bread consumption increased by 35 percent, milk consumption increased by more than twofold compared to 1948, and meat consumption increased by 1.5 times.

    In the second half of 1949, the Hungarian National Assembly passed a law establishing a new urban area in the capital, deciding to incorporate more than 600,000 people in the suburbs into the city of Greater Budapest. Thus, Budapest has become the seventh most populous city in Europe. Budapest is currently building new factories, schools, and apartments, and will soon have an underground railway.

　　苏军解放匈京五周年
    匈劳动人民赴红军纪念碑前献花圈
    【新华社北京十四日电】综合塔斯社消息：十三日，匈牙利劳动人民热烈纪念苏军解放布达佩斯五周年。匈京人民列队到苏联红军纪念碑前敬献花圈。匈牙利各报均刊载专文纪念。
    苏联红星报刊载科尔涅夫的纪念文章称：五年前苏军解放布达佩斯之时，希特勒匪徒几乎摧毁了城中四分之三的工业建筑和住宅，并且把多瑙河上所有的八座桥全部炸毁。匈牙利劳动人民在工人党领导下重建了布达佩斯，修好了多瑙河上的每一座桥，恢复了被破坏的企业，并加以扩充，现在，布达佩斯已很少看到破坏的痕迹。
    首都人民生活已显著提高，一九四九年，在取消配给制后，面包消费量增加了百分之三十五，牛奶的消费量较一九四八年增加了二倍多，肉消费量增加了一·五倍。
    一九四九年后半年，匈牙利国民议会通过了建立首都新市区法，决定把郊区六十余万人民划到大布达佩斯市内，这样布达佩斯就成了欧洲第七个人口最多的都市。布达佩斯现正建造新的工厂、学校和公寓，不久即将有地下火车。
