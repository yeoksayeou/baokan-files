　　Using Sideline Occupations to Accumulate Funds and Prepare for Spring Agricultural Production
  　Heilongjiang Farmers Have Already Purchased Over a Thousand Large Carts and More Than Two Thousand Head of Livestock
    [This Newspaper's Report] Heilongjiang Province has achieved considerable success in winter sideline production, and is using sideline income to accumulate production funds and prepare for spring agricultural production in a timely manner. From November of last year to mid-January of this year, the province's sideline production generated an income of over 892.8 billion yuan, equivalent to approximately 651,000 *shi* of sorghum (excluding domestic animal sideline occupations). This completes one-third of the original winter sideline production plan of 2.3 million *shi* of grain. Ten counties in the province, including Tao'an, Zhaozhou, Taonan, Tailai, Longjiang, Zhaodong, and Tieli, have completed more than half of their respective county's sideline production plans. Some areas have launched mass sideline production campaigns, with most of the labor force participating. In Tao'an County, 29,987 laborers are involved in sideline production, accounting for three-quarters of the county's labor force. Statistics from nine districts in Tailai show that more than 12,000 women are participating in mat weaving, *cui* weaving, and bag cover weaving, generating an income of over 7.6 billion yuan.
    Apart from a small portion used to address livelihood issues in disaster areas, most of the income from sideline production is used to purchase means of production, laying a good foundation for this year's agricultural production. Eight counties in the province, including Zhaoyuan, Taikang, and Taonan, have used sideline income to purchase 1,163 large carts and rubber-tired carts, 1,377 horses, 1,070 head of cattle and mules, over 30,000 *pi* of cloth, over 10,000 *shi* of grain, and a large quantity of other daily necessities. However, wastefulness still exists in some areas. In a small number of areas, sideline production has not yet been mobilized, such as in Mingshui and Gannan counties, where statistics up to mid-January show that less than 10% of the plan has been achieved. Some areas exhibit a one-sided approach, even proposing that "sideline occupations are not allowed until public grain is fully delivered." In addition, the failure to implement and promote the method of establishing purchase and sales contracts in sideline production is also an important reason for the failure to universally develop sideline production. In order to correct the above shortcomings, the provincial government has instructed all counties to conduct in-depth inspections of leadership, disseminate successful experiences, and resolve specific difficulties; at the same time, strengthen leadership over cooperatives at all levels to establish purchase and sales contracts in a planned manner, so that sideline production forms a mass movement to complete the original plan.

　　利用副业积累资金  准备春季农业生产
  　黑龙江农民已买大车千余辆牲畜二千多头
    【本报讯】黑龙江省冬季副业生产获得不少成绩，并用副业积累生产资金及时准备春季农业生产。该省从去年十一月开始至今年一月中旬，副业生产共收入八千九百二十八亿元以上，折合高粱约六十五万一千余石（家畜副业不在内）。已完成原订冬季副业生产计划——二百三十万石粮的三分之一。该省洮安、肇州、洮南、泰来、龙江、肇东、铁骊等十县已完成各该县副业生产计划的二分之一以上。部分地区则已展开群众性的副业生产运动，大部劳力都参加。洮安县有二万九千九百八十七个劳力参加副业生产，占全县劳动力四分之三。泰来九个区统计，即有一万二千余妇女参加编席、编茓、编套包等，收入七十六亿余元。
    副业生产收入除少数灾区用于解决生活问题外，大部用于购买生产资料，给今年农业生产奠定良好基础。该省肇源、泰康、洮南等八县，已用副业收入购买大车及胶皮车一千一百六十三辆、马一千三百七十七匹、牛骡一千零七十头、布三万余匹、粮食万余石及其他大量日用品。但个别地区还存在了浪费现象。少部分地区副业生产尚未发动起来，如明水、甘南等县直到一月中旬统计尚未达到计划的百分之十。部分地区存在单打一现象，甚至提出“公粮未送完不准搞副业”。另外，副业生产中未贯彻与推广订立购销合同的办法，亦为副业生产未普遍展开的重要原因之一。为纠正上述缺点，目前省府已指示各县，应深入检查领导，传播成功经验，解决具体困难；同时，加强领导各级合作社有计划的订立购销合同，使副业生产形成群众性运动，以完成原订计划。
