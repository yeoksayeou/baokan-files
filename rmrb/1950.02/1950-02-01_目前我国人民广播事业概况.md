　　An Overview of China's People's Broadcasting Undertaking
    Wen Jize
    In the first month after the victory of the Anti-Japanese War in 1945, the Yan'an Xinhua Broadcasting Station and the Zhangjiakou Xinhua Broadcasting Station began broadcasting, marking the beginning of China's own people's broadcasting undertaking. Over the past four years, China's People's Broadcasting Undertaking has undergone a period of arduous struggle and now, with the birth of New China, has the conditions for smooth development. More than four years ago, the broadcasting studio of the Yan'an Xinhua Broadcasting Station was located in an earthen cave in a mountain gully, and the broadcasting studio of the Shaanbei Xinhua Broadcasting Station was once located in a very small and dilapidated temple. Now we have modern broadcasting studios. More than four years ago, we only had small-powered radio transmitters of a few hundred watts, but now we have powerful radio transmitters ranging from tens to one hundred kilowatts. In the beginning, we only had two broadcasting stations, but now we have forty-nine people's broadcasting stations. In the past, we could not directly connect with the audience, but now we are able to organize a broad audience and more effectively listen to the broadcasts.

    Excluding the Central People's Broadcasting Station, the distribution of local people's broadcasting stations is as follows: In North China, there are eight people's broadcasting stations in Beijing, Tianjin, Zhangjiakou, Baoding, Taiyuan, Tangshan, Xinxiang, and Guihua; in the Northeast, there are sixteen people's broadcasting stations in Shenyang, Harbin, Changchun, Qiqihar, Yanji, Jilin, Andong, Mudanjiang, Jinzhou, Anshan, Yingkou, Tonghua, Fushun, Chengde, Dalian, and Siping; in East China, there are thirteen people's broadcasting stations in Shanghai, Nanjing, Hangzhou, Jinan, Qingdao, Xuzhou, Nantong, Suzhou, Wuxi, Changzhou, Shaoxing, Fuzhou, and Wenzhou; in Central South, there are four people's broadcasting stations in Wuhan, Nanchang, Changsha, and Guangzhou; in the Northwest, there are four people's broadcasting stations in Xi'an, Lanzhou, Xining, and Dihua; in the Southwest, there are three people's broadcasting stations in Chongqing, Kunming, and Chengdu. Except for individual stations (such as Wenzhou) which are still under construction, or because the situation is unclear due to the recent liberation, the rest have officially started broadcasting.

    In addition, there are now more than thirty private broadcasting stations in the liberated areas across the country, most of which are concentrated in Shanghai.

    In order to lead the rapidly expanding and developing People's Broadcasting Undertaking, the Central Broadcasting Affairs Administration was established in June 1949, according to the decision of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China. In October of the same year, the Central People's Government was established, and the People's Broadcasting Undertaking was unified under the leadership of the government. The newly established Broadcasting Affairs Bureau is directly under the General Administration of Press and Publication of the Central People's Government. The task of the Broadcasting Affairs Bureau is to uniformly lead the national broadcasting undertaking and manage national broadcasting institutions.

    China's People's Broadcasting Undertaking is very young and has many shortcomings. For example, many broadcasting cadres lack experience in broadcasting work, the content of the broadcasts cannot fully meet the needs of the broad audience, it is not diverse enough, some things are not suitable for listening, there are still very few lectures and entertainment programs, the work of organizing the audience has just begun, and many factories and schools do not have radio equipment, etc. However, it has also achieved many successes in the past few years of work. Its voice has become familiar to the broad audience, the millions of troops at the front, and many local government cadres. At the end of 1947, 600,000 People's Liberation Army soldiers who had crossed the Yellow River read news and other things copied from the radio stations every day from the mimeographed newspapers of various units. In the past, many government agencies in the liberated areas stipulated that radio stations should be used as a tool to convey government orders to lower levels. Before liberation, students in many cities such as Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, Nanjing, Hankou, Xi'an, and Chongqing learned about the trends of the times from the broadcasts and were encouraged and instructed by them. For example, in early 1948, students from several universities in Shanghai and Beijing copied Mao Zedong's "The Present Situation and Our Tasks" broadcast by the Shaanbei Xinhua Broadcasting Station, secretly mimeographed and distributed it. At that time, in areas under the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, many people relied on listening to the radio to find their direction of struggle. I remember that in the months before the Yan'an Xinhua Broadcasting Station withdrew from Yan'an, it received letters from dozens of listeners in Beiping, Nanjing, Chongqing, and other places. These letters were brought to Yan'an after overcoming various obstacles. Some letters said: "We live in the vast darkness, and we only feel like we have seen a beacon when we hear the voice of Yan'an every night." Some letters said: "Please broadcast a few more hours every day!" Every letter was full of enthusiasm. At that time, in many cities in the Kuomintang-controlled areas, not only workers, students, and citizens listened to the radio, but also Kuomintang officials and soldiers. The vast majority of Kuomintang military officers, air force, and navy personnel who revolted or were captured said that they listened to it frequently. Many Kuomintang military officers listened particularly enthusiastically when they were besieged or attacked by the People's Liberation Army. After hearing our speeches to the Kuomintang army again and again, many people were determined to join the people's side.

    After we entered large cities such as Shenyang, Tianjin, Beijing, Nanjing, and Shanghai to run broadcasting, our connection with the audience became more direct and closer. Major radio stations frequently receive letters from listeners, including workers, students, ordinary citizens, government staff, and troops. They not only expressed their enthusiasm for the People's Broadcasting Undertaking, but also put forward many valuable opinions and requests. Not long ago, the Central People's Broadcasting Station also received letters from listeners in Southeast Asia and feedback from listeners in Korea.

    Why can our broadcasting undertaking receive such enthusiastic care from the people? This is because the People's Broadcasting Undertaking is a part of the people's liberation struggle and also a part of the construction of New China. From the first day of its inception, our broadcast truly represented the people, and the content of the broadcast was what all Chinese people should know, urgently need to know, and are very willing to know. It is combined with the demands of the people. Shortly after the success of the October Revolution in the Soviet Union, Lenin attached great importance to radio broadcasting. He called radio broadcasting "mass rallies of millions of people" and "newspapers without paper and without distance." He instructed that radio broadcasting should become a powerful tool for cultural and political education for the broad masses of the people. We are working hard in this direction.

    The programs of our radio stations include lectures on social sciences, natural sciences, and Russian. The natural science lectures of the Central People's Broadcasting Station have been broadcast for five months, and more than 100 natural science experts, professors, and authors have been invited to write for it. From January 1950, the Central People's Broadcasting Station added social science lectures, inviting experts to teach the basic knowledge of Marxism-Leninism, organizing listeners in various places to study, and answering various questions raised by listeners in their studies. There are news, communications, comprehensive reports, and commentaries, which are about current affairs. There are programs for workers, youth, women, and children, which mainly guide the activities of workers, youth, women, and children's groups in various places. There are also literary and entertainment programs, including new songs, local songs, radio dramas, foreign music, etc. Many radio stations often organize literary and artistic groups and singing teams and drama teams from factories and schools to broadcast at the radio stations. The Central People's Broadcasting Station has also established a broadcasting literary and artistic troupe, specializing in literary and artistic broadcasting work.

    Radio broadcasting is a modern tool for propaganda and education. It is different from other propaganda and education tools. It can be said that it is not limited by distance. The voice from Beijing can be heard thousands of miles away immediately through radio broadcasting. People who cannot read can also understand it. For our country, which has a vast territory and a large number of illiterate people, radio broadcasting has become a very important tool for educating the people.

    For international propaganda, radio broadcasting is also a powerful tool. Due to the victory of the Chinese revolution, people all over the world, especially the people of the East, are more eagerly demanding to know the experience of the Chinese people's struggle, to know the situation of the construction of New China, and to hear the voice of the Chinese people. Therefore, our broadcasting undertaking must also serve the people of the world, especially the fraternal nations of the East.

    Currently, the People's Broadcasting Undertaking is preparing to make such efforts:

    First, in terms of domestic broadcasting, the content of the broadcasts will focus on strengthening the political and cultural education of workers, organized youth, and working cadres. The construction of radio stations will focus on major cities across the country, forming a national broadcasting network. At the same time, radios will be distributed and wired broadcasting will be constructed in a planned manner. Through broadcasting groups and various lecture listening and study groups, the audience will be organized.

    Second, in terms of international broadcasting, a dedicated international broadcasting station will be built, and international broadcasting to Southeast Asia will be established first.

    Third, train cadres for broadcasting work.

    Overall, China's People's Broadcasting Undertaking is still in its initial stage, and our broadcasting staff and the broad audience need to make long-term and arduous efforts together.

　　目前我国人民广播事业概况
    温济泽
    一九四五年抗日战争胜利后的第一个月里，延安新华广播电台和张家口新华广播电台开始播音，这是我国人民自己的广播事业的开始。四年多以来，中国人民广播事业，经历了一段艰苦奋斗的历史，现在已经随着新中国的诞生而具备了顺利发展的条件。四年多以前，延安新华广播电台的播音室是设在山沟里的土窑洞里，陕北新华广播电台的播音室曾一度设在一间很小很小的破庙里，现在我们已经有了现代化的播音室了；四年多以前，我们只有几百瓦特的小电力的广播机，现在已经有几十到一百基罗瓦特的强大电力的广播机了；开始的时候，我们只有两个广播电台，现在已经有四十九个人民广播电台了。过去我们不能够与听众直接发生联系，而现在我们已经能够组织广大的听众，更有效地来收听广播了。
    除去中央人民广播电台外，各地方的人民广播电台分布的情形是这样：在华北有北京市、天津、张家口、保定、太原、唐山、新乡、归绥等八个人民广播电台；在东北，有沈阳、哈尔滨、长春、齐齐哈尔、延吉、吉林、安东、牡丹江、锦州、鞍山、营口、通化、抚顺、承德、大连和四平等十六个人民广播电台；在华东，有上海、南京、杭州、济南、青岛、徐州、南通、苏州、无锡、常州、绍兴、福州、温州等十三个人民广播电台；在中南，有武汉、南昌、长沙、广州等四个人民广播电台；在西北，有西安、兰州、西宁、迪化等四个人民广播电台；在西南，有重庆、昆明、成都等三个人民广播电台。除个别电台（如温州）尚在筹建，或因为刚解放情况尚不明了而外，其余的都已正式播音。
    此外，现在全国解放区还有三十多个私营广播电台，这些私营台绝大部分集中在上海。
    为着领导迅速扩大和发展的人民广播事业，在一九四九年六月，根据中共中央决定，成立了中央广播事业管理处。同年十月，中央人民政府成立，人民广播事业统一归政府领导。新设立的广播事业局，直属中央人民政府新闻总署。广播事业局的任务是统一领导全国广播事业，管理国家广播机构。
    中国人民广播事业很年青，缺点还很多，例如有不少广播工作干部缺乏广播工作的经验，广播的内容还不能完全适合广大听众的需要，还不够多样化，有些东西还不适合耳朵听，讲座和文艺娱乐节目还很少，组织听众的工作还刚刚开始，许多工厂和学校里还没有收音设备等等。但是在过去几年的工作中，它也有不少成绩。它的声音已经成为广大听众和前方几百万部队以及许多地方机关干部所熟悉的声音。在一九四七年底，打过黄河的人民解放军部队，每天就有六十万人从各部队的油印小报上读到每天从广播电台抄收下来的记录新闻和其他的东西。过去解放区许多政府机关，曾规定把广播电台作为向下级传达政令的一种工具。北京、天津、上海、南京、汉口、西安、重庆等许多城市的学生，在解放前，都曾经从广播中去了解时局的动向，从此中得到鼓励和指示，例如一九四八年初，上海、北京就有几个大学的学生抄收陕北新华广播电台播送的毛主席的《目前形势和我们的任务》，秘密地油印散发出去。在当时国民党反动统治的地区，有很多人是靠收听广播来寻找他们奋斗的方向的。记得在延安新华广播电台撤出延安的前几个月，曾经收到当时的北平、南京、重庆等地几十位听众的信，这些信都是冲破种种阻拦才带到延安的，有的信里说：“我们生活在茫茫的黑夜中，只有每天晚上听到了延安的声音才像看到了明灯。”有的信里说：“你们每天多播几小时吧！”封封信都充满着热情。当时在国民党统治区的许多城市里，不仅工人、学生和市民，国民党官员军队中收听的也很普遍，绝大多数起义的或被俘的国民党军队军军官，空军海军人员，都说他们是经常收听的；有许多国民党军军官在被解放军围困或者围攻的时候，收听得特别热心，好些人在一次又一次地听到我们的对国民党军讲话后，下决心投到人民方面来。
    在我们进入沈阳、天津、北京、南京、上海等大城市办广播以后，我们和听众的联系更直接更密切了。各大电台都经常收到听众的信，这里边有工人的，学生的，一般市民的，机关工作人员的，部队的，他们不但表示了他们爱护人民广播事业的热情，并且提出许多很宝贵的意见和要求。不久以前，中央人民广播电台还收到过南洋听众的信和朝鲜听众的反映。
    我们的广播事业为什么能得到人民这样热烈的爱护呢？这是因为人民广播事业是人民解放斗争事业的一部分，也是新中国建设事业的一部分。我们的广播，从开始的第一天起，就是真正代表人民说话的，广播的内容都是全中国人民所应该知道、所迫切需要知道和极愿意知道的东西，它和人民的要求是结合在一起的。在苏联十月革命刚成功不久，列宁就很重视无线电广播，他把无线电广播叫做“千百万人的群众大会”，叫做“不用纸和没有距离的报纸”，他指示要使无线电广播成为向广大人民进行文化和政治教育的强大工具。我们正是往这个方向努力去做的。
    我们各广播电台的节目，有社会科学、自然科学、俄文等讲座，中央人民广播电台的自然科学讲座，已经播讲了五个月了，约请了一百多位自然科学专家、教授和作者为它写稿；从一九五○年一月起，中央人民广播电台增设社会科学讲座，约请专家讲授马列主义的基础知识，组织各地听众学习，解答听众在学习中提出的各种问题；有新闻、通讯、综合报导、评论等节目，这是关于时事的；有职工、青年、妇女、儿童等节目，这主要是指导各地职工、青年、妇女和儿童团活动的；还有文艺娱乐节目，包括新歌曲、地方歌曲、广播剧、外国音乐等，许多电台经常组织各文艺工作团体和各工厂，学校的歌咏队、演剧队到广播电台来广播；中央人民广播电台还成立了广播文艺工作团，专门从事于文艺广播工作。
    无线电广播是一个近代化的宣传教育的工具。它和别的宣传教育工具不同，它可以说是不受距离的限制，北京发出的声音，经过无线电广播，几千里外马上可以听到；不认字的人也可以听得懂；这对于地区辽阔，文盲众多的我们国家来说，无线电广播就更加成为教育人民的非常重要的工具。
    对于国际宣传来说，无线电广播也是一个强有力的工具。由于中国革命的胜利，全世界人民，特别是东方的人民，都更迫切地要求知道中国人民斗争的经验，要求知道新中国建设的情形，要求听中国人民的声音，因此，我们的广播事业还必须为全世界的人民特别是东方各兄弟民族的人民服务。
    目前人民广播事业正在准备作这样的努力：
    第一、国内广播方面，广播内容将着重加强对职工、组织青年及在职干部的政治的和文化的教育，广播电台的建设以全国各大城市为中心，构成全国广播网，同时有计划地配售收音机及筹建有线广播，通过广播小组及各种讲座的收听学习小组，把听众组织起来。
    第二、国际广播方面，筹建专门的国际广播电台，首先建立对东南亚的国际广播。
    第三、培养广播工作的干部。
    整个说来，目前我国人民广播事业还在初期阶段，还须我们广播工作人员及广大听众共同作长期艰巨的努力。
