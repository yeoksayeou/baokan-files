Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, February 9th: The first National Telecom Conference convened by the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications of the Central People's Government in Beijing, lasting sixteen days, concluded today. The conference heard reports from representatives from various regions and a report from Vice Minister of Posts and Telecommunications Wang Zheng on the national telecom engineering construction policy and tasks for 1950. It discussed in detail the unified management and scheduling of organization, finance, materials, and personnel. The conference unanimously agreed that it is necessary to achieve unification of national telecommunications services and adopted various unified management and scheduling plans.

Regarding the issue of organizational unification, the conference decided to adopt a four-level system (General Bureau, General Sub-bureau, Administration Bureau, Telecom Bureau) in organization. Because China is a vast country, General Sub-bureaus will be established in major administrative regions to assist the General Bureau in managing and supervising telecommunications services and construction matters in their respective regions.

Regarding the issue of financial unification, the conference decided that national telecommunications funds should be based on the principle of unified allocation and reasonable adjustment of profits and losses. The consolidation method is divided into two types: the general treasury system and the non-general treasury system. Telecom Bureaus in areas implementing the general treasury system shall remit all their income to the general treasury, which will be managed and scheduled uniformly by the Finance Department of the General Bureau. Telecom Bureaus in areas implementing the non-general treasury system will be uniformly scheduled by the Administration Bureau in their respective regions. However, regardless of whether a Telecom Bureau implements the general treasury system or the non-general treasury system, all expenditures must be strictly managed in accordance with the budget approved by the General Bureau.

Establish International Radio Station in Beijing to Connect with Countries Such as the Soviet Union
Strive to Complete Radio Facsimile Transmission Between Beijing, Shanghai, and Moscow

Regarding the national telecom engineering construction plan for 1950, the conference agreed with Vice Minister Wang's report on the telecommunications engineering construction policy and tasks for 1950. The report pointed out that the national telecom engineering construction tasks for 1950 are: First, to establish a national long-distance wired telephone and telegraph main line network to fully connect the central government with the leadership centers of major administrative regions. The entire project includes erecting 3,086 kilometers of telephone poles on main lines within the customs (22 poles per kilometer), stringing 8,283 pair-kilometers of copper wire, and repairing 2,039 kilometers. Outside the customs, repairing 1,028 kilometers, replacing 969 kilometers of poles, and adding 3,424 pair-kilometers of copper wire. Second, to establish an international radio station in the capital. This year, we will first establish direct telecommunications links with neighboring socialist and new democratic countries and strive to complete radio facsimile equipment between Beijing, Shanghai, and Moscow. Third, to restore and strengthen coastal radio stations and riverbank radio stations within the first half of this year to serve coastal and inland river shipping. In addition, we must reorganize and strengthen the capital's urban telephone equipment and, to the extent possible, restore major lines within various administrative regions.

Finally, the conference estimated the revenue and expenditure situation for 1950 and believed that the current revenue and expenditure cannot be balanced. Relying solely on government subsidies would be tantamount to increasing the burden on farmers. Therefore, the conference decided that telegram and telephone charges will be based on the "real public bond points" standard and adjusted according to the public bond price. The conference also formulated charging standards: ordinary telegrams will cost 0.07 "real public bond points" per word, with code and express telegrams doubling the price. Long-distance calls will be calculated at 70 ordinary telegram words.

At today's closing ceremony, Minister Zhu Xuefan delivered a closing speech, stating that this year's restoration and construction project is arduous, and a portion of the investment must be allocated from this year's business income. Therefore, he called on national telecom workers to develop business, increase revenue, oppose waste, and save expenses to ensure the completion of this year's restoration and construction project. Vice Chairman Zhu De of the Central People's Government also attended and spoke at today's meeting. Vice Chairman Zhu called on telecom workers in both new and old areas to strengthen unity, continue to carry forward the spirit of hard struggle, overcome difficulties, and learn from the advanced construction experience of the Soviet Union, and strive to run the people's telecommunications business well.

　　全国首届电信会议闭幕
    确定建立长途电话电报干线  沟通中央与各大行政区联系
    【新华社北京九日电】中央人民政府邮电部在京召开的首届全国电信会议，历时十六天，已于今日闭幕。会议听取了各地代表的汇报和邮电部王诤副部长关于一九五○年全国电信工程建设方针与任务的报告，详细讨论了组织、财务、器材、人事的统一管理、调度问题。会议一致认为全国电信业务有实现统一的必要，且通过了各种统一管理、调度的方案。
    关于组织统一问题，会议决定在组织上采用四级制（总局、总分局、管理局、电信局）。因为中国地区辽阔，所以在各大行政区设立总分局，以协助总局管辖及监督各该地区的电信业务与建设事项。
    关于财务统一问题，会议决定，全国电信资金以统筹支配、合理调剂盈亏为原则。其整理办法分总金库制非总金库制两种。凡实行总金库制地区的电信局，其一切收入悉数解入总金库，由总局财务处掌握统一筹划调度；凡实行非总金库制地区的电信局，由各该地区的管理局统一调度。但不论实行总金库制与非总金库制的电信局，一切开支必须按照总局核定的预算严格管理。
    在京设立国际电台  和苏联等国家联系
    争取完成京沪与莫斯科无线电传真
    关于一九五○年全国电信工程建设计划，会议同意王副部长关于一九五○年电信工程建设方针与任务的报告。该报告指出，一九五○年全国电信工程建设任务为：第一、要建立全国长途有线电话、电报主要干线网，使中央与各大行政区领导中心间的联系全部沟通。全部工程，计关内主要干线立电杆三○八六公里（每公里二十二根），架铜线八二八三对公里。整修二○三九公里；关外整修一○二八公里，立杆换杆九六九公里，增加铜线三四二四对公里。第二、要在首都建立国际电台。今年首先与临近的社会主义国家和新民主主义国家建立直接的电信联系和争取完成北京、上海与莫斯科间的无线电传真设备。第三、要在今年上半年内恢复与加强海岸电台与江岸电台，为沿海及内河航运服务。此外，还要整理与加强首都的市内电话设备，在可能范围内要恢复各行政区内的主要线路等。
    最后，会议估计了一九五○年的收支状况，认为：目前收支尚不能平衡，如单纯依赖政府补贴，无异增加农民负担。因此会议决定今后电报、电话收费以折实公债分为标准，随公债牌价调整之。会议并拟定了收费标准：普通电报每字零点零七个折实公债分，密码、加急加倍。长途电话以七十个普通电报字计算。
    今日闭幕式上朱学范部长致闭幕词称，今年的恢复建设工程是繁重的，其中一部分投资尚须由今年业务收入中拨出。因此，他要求全国电信工作人员以发展业务、增加收入、反对浪费，节省开支，来保证今年恢复建设工程的完成。今日会议中央人民政府朱德副主席亦曾出席讲话。朱副主席号召新老区电信职工加强团结，继续发扬艰苦奋斗的精神，克服困难，同时要学习苏联先进的建设经验，为办好人民电信事业而努力。
