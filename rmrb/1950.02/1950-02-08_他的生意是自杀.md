　　“His Business is Suicide...”
　　Young John Hazelitt, a former U.S. Air Force captain who fought in Sicily and Italy and was twice commended by the President, committed suicide two years after the end of the war... This decorated veteran could not find a job. According to his wife, Hazelitt received an eviction notice shortly before his suicide, and in desperation, he ended his life. This is a common phenomenon in modern America.
　　American newspapers treat the increasing number of suicides as sensational news material. Fifty-two-year-old Anchiano committed suicide by jumping into the water from the Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco. The newspaper immediately pointed out this "new record": this is the one-hundredth American to "choose the largest bridge in San Francisco to end his life."
　　Special guards have been stationed on the 102nd floor of the "Empire State Building" in New York. This is because suicidal people have taken a liking to this largest building in the city.
　　The *Daily Mirror* once published an interview with Mr. Warren, chairman of the "Life Saving League of the Golden State." According to Warren: "Difficult economic conditions are the reason for most suicides. People's lives were more secure during the war, so the number of suicides decreased. After the war, it increased again..."
　　The newspaper then quoted some statistics, which in themselves explain everything without the need for any commentary: in the United States, an average of 20,000 people commit suicide every day. Another 40,000 people attempt suicide.
　　But the most memorable thing is the title of this interview in the *Daily Mirror*. Under the name of the chairman of the "Life Saving League" was the following title: "His Business is Suicide..."

### “他的生意是自杀……”

　　“他的生意是自杀……”
    年青的约翰·海兹莱特，前美国空军上尉，曾在西西里和意大利作战，两次受到总统的嘉奖，但是在战争结束二年后，他自杀了……这位有功的老兵始终找不到工作。事后据他的妻子说，海兹莱特自杀前不久接到迁屋的命令，在无可奈何下，他结束了自己的生命。这——在现代美国是屡见不鲜的现象。
    美国报纸把不断增长的自杀案件只看作耸人听闻的新闻资料。五十二岁的安奇盎诺在旧金山的金门桥上投水自杀了。报纸立刻指出这个“新纪录”：这是第一百名美国人，“选择旧金山最大的桥来结束自己的生命”。
    在纽约一百○二层的“帝国大楼”上派了专门的警卫守护。这是因为自杀者都看中了这幢市内最大的建筑物。
    《每日镜报》上曾刊载一篇《金国救生联盟》的主席华伦先生访问记。据华伦说：“困难的经济条件是大多数自杀的原因。战时人民生活较有保障，因此自杀的数量也减少了。战争结束后，就重新增加起来……”
    该报接着引述了一些统计数字，这些数字本身就说明了一切，而不需任何注释：在美国，平均每天有二万人自杀。还有四万人企图自杀。
    但最值得回味的，却是《每日镜报》这篇访问记的题目了。在“救生联盟”主席的名字下，登着这样的题目：“他的生意是自杀……”
