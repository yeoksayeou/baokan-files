Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 26th: TASS Moscow dispatch: Pravda published on the 24th Grigoryan's essay on the development of Communist parties in various countries. The author wrote: As is well known, in the war years, right-wing socialists cowardly sold out their people and countries to the Hitlerite aggressors. Only the Communist Party proved to be the true defender of the national interests of the people and the loyal organizer of resistance to Hitlerite occupation. Therefore, they won the trust of the people and their prestige among the people, which is reflected in the growth of the influence of the fraternal Communist parties and their incalculable strength.

The progressive working masses of the world are increasingly clear about the treacherous acts of the right-wing social parties. The leaders of the right-wing social parties live by deceiving the people and use beautiful "revolutionary" words to cover up their betrayal of the interests of the working class and working people. When the U.S. State Department openly asserted on January 15, 1948, that "socialists are the most important pillar in Europe against communism," the running dogs of right-wing socialists in American imperialism received a shameful commendation.

The author continued: The people of the world are uniting more and more closely around the Communist Party, which is leading the struggle for peace against the American and British imperialists and domestic reactionaries. On the eve of World War II, the French Communist Party had only 340,000 members, while now it has 669,000 members; the Italian Communist Party had only 58,000 members on the eve of the war, while now it has 2.3 million members. The Chinese Communist Party has more than 4 million members.

The influence and prestige of the Communist and Workers' Parties in the European People's Democratic countries has greatly increased. On the eve of the war, the Czechoslovak Communist Party had 80,000 members, while now it has 2.3 million; the Polish United Workers' Party had 20,000 members before the war, while now it has 1.36 million; the Romanian Workers' Party had 1,000 members before the war, while now it has 1 million; on the eve of the war, the Hungarian Working People's Party had 30,000 members, while now it has 950,000; the Bulgarian Communist Party had 8,000 members before the war, while now it has 460,000. The author particularly emphasized that the Soviet people and hundreds of millions of working people around the world love the Bolshevik Party because of its great revolutionary activities, which have led to the destruction of the capitalist system and led human history into a new era.

The author concluded: If the international bourgeoisie is now furious and perceives that the Communist and Workers' Parties have developed into huge forces in various countries and uses all kinds of cruel means to deal with the Communists, it is because history has doomed them to an inevitable death.

　　把人类的历史导入新的时代
    各国共产党威望大增
    全世界人民团结在党的周围坚决争取和平
    真理报发表格里哥尔扬论文
    【新华社北京二十六日电】塔斯社莫斯科讯：真理报于二十四日发表格里哥尔扬关于世界各国共产党发展的论文。作者写道：如所周知，在战争的年代里，右翼社会党人卑怯地将其人民及国家出卖给希特勒侵略者。只有共产党证明是人民的民族利益之真正保卫者和抵抗希特勒占领的忠贞的组织者。因此，他们赢得了人民的信任和在人民中的威望，这种信任和威望表现在各兄弟共产党的影响的增长及其无可计算的力量。
    对于右翼社会党的背叛行为，世界进步劳动群众是愈来愈看得清清楚楚了。右翼社会党的领袖们靠欺骗人民过日子，靠“革命”的好听词句来掩饰其对工人阶级和劳动人民利益的背叛。当一九四八年一月十五日美国国务院公开地断言“社会党人是在欧洲反对共产主义的最重要的支柱”时，美国帝国主义的右翼社会党走卒就得到了可羞的褒状了。
    作者继称：全世界的人民大众正越来越紧密地团结在领导着争取和平、反对美英帝国主义者及国内反动派的斗争的共产党周围。在第二次世界大战前夜，法国共产党只有三十四万党员，而现在则已有六十六万九千党员；意大利共产党在大战前夜只有五万八千党员，而现在已有两百三十万党员。中国共产党的党员超过了四百万。
    共产党与工人党的影响与威望在欧洲人民民主国家中已大大地增加。在大战前夕，捷克斯洛伐克共产党有八万党员，而现在则有二百三十万；波兰统一工人党战前有二万党员，而现在则有一百三十六万；罗马尼亚工人党战前有一千党员，而现在则有一百万；在大战前夕，匈牙利劳动人民党有三万党员，而现在则有九十五万；保加利亚共产党战前有八千党员，而现在则有四十六万。作者特别强调称，苏维埃人民和全世界亿万劳动人民之所以热爱布尔什维克党，是因为它的伟大的革命活动，这种活动使得资本主义制度开始毁灭，并把人类的历史导入新的时代。
    作者最后说：如果说，国际资产阶级现在暴怒若狂，察觉到共产党与工人党已在世界各国中发展成为巨大的力量，并用各种残酷手段来对付共产党人的话，这是因为，历史已经注定了他们不可避免的死亡的命运。
