Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, February 23rd. The factory hygiene inspection team, jointly formed by the Ministry of Labor, the Ministry of Health, the Ministry of Textile Industry of the Central People's Government, the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, and the Preparatory Committee of the National Textile Workers' Union, which departed for Tianjin on the 9th of this month, returned to Beijing on the 16th. At 7 p.m. on the 19th, the team reported its inspection findings to Minister Li Lisan of the Ministry of Labor at the All-China Federation of Trade Unions. During its seven days of intensive work in Tianjin, the team inspected seven state-owned factories, including China Textile Factories No. 2, 4, 5, 6, and 7, China Textile Machinery Factory, and North China Bristle Company, as well as the China Textile Hospital. It also inspected four private factories, including Renli Wool Weaving Company, Dasheng Yarn Factory, Beiyang Yarn Factory, and Lizhong Chemical Company. The inspection revealed that some factories in Tianjin had begun to pay attention to and improve factory hygiene after Minister Li Lisan visited China Textile Factory No. 3 last month and raised the issue of factory hygiene. However, hygiene problems in most factories remain serious. The sanitary conditions of the factory surroundings, workshops, dormitories, canteens, and toilets all have serious shortcomings, and these shortcomings can be improved without spending a lot of money. This shows that the existence of these shortcomings is mainly due to the lack of due attention paid to hygiene issues related to workers' health by factory administration and trade union leaders. Among the factories inspected, the sanitary facilities of the private Dasheng Yarn Factory were particularly poor. Of the factory's 390 employees, only two toilets are currently usable for both men and women. People downstairs have to go to the third floor to defecate and urinate. The toilet bowls are covered with feces, and the floor is littered with toilet paper, making it too filthy to enter. The sanitary situation at North China Bristle Company is even more serious. There are too many workers in the factory building, and the bristles are sent to the factory for sorting without being washed, resulting in dust like fog and a foul smell. Currently, 33 of the factory's 1,150 workers are coughing up blood, 32 suffer from asthma, 6 suffer from general swelling, more than 70 are off work due to illness, and coughing is even more common.

Minister Li Lisan, after listening to the report, pointed out that the reasons for the current very serious factory hygiene problems are: (1) In the past, bureaucratic capitalists did not pay attention to workers' health at all, or deliberately created harsh conditions, such as dirty and simple toilet facilities, to restrict workers' activities; the same was true for private enterprises. (2) China's industry is underdeveloped, its culture is backward, and there is a general lack of hygiene knowledge and habits. (3) Factory and enterprise administrative leaders or capitalists lack due attention to hygiene issues, and trade union leaders have not paid attention to urging the administrative side and capitalists to improve sanitary conditions, nor have they carried out hygiene education work among the masses. Minister Li emphasized that the third point is the main reason. Only if the third point is changed can the first and second reasons be gradually overcome and the factory hygiene situation be fundamentally improved. The current serious phenomenon is probably not limited to Tianjin, so all factories and enterprises across the country should pay attention to it. Finally, it was decided that the inspection team should be responsible for sorting out the investigation report within the next few days and put forward specific improvement suggestions on the safety and hygiene problems of each factory. In addition, they should also separately draft "Factory Hygiene Regulations," "Implementation Measures for Factory Hygiene Education," and "Factory Hygiene Organization Regulations" for submission to the relevant authorities for discussion, approval, and implementation.

    李立三部长指出轻视工人卫生的严重现象应引起全国各地的注意
    【新华社北京二十三日电】由中央人民政府劳动部、卫生部、纺织工业部及中华全国总工会、全国纺织工会筹委会联合组成于本月九日出发到天津的工厂卫生检查组已于十六日返京，十九日下午七时，该组假全国总工会向劳动部李立三部长汇报检查情况。该组在天津经过七天的紧张工作，总共检查了中纺二、四、五、六、七厂、中纺机器厂、华北猪鬃公司等七个公营工厂及中纺医院，同时并检查了仁立毛织公司、达生纱厂、北洋纱厂、利中化学公司等四个私营工厂。在检查中发现自上月李立三部长参观中纺三厂提出工厂卫生问题后，天津有些工厂已开始注意，并着手改进工厂卫生工作。但是一般工厂中的卫生问题，仍很严重，无论厂房四周、车间、宿舍、食堂、厕所等处的卫生状况，都有严重缺点，而这些缺点是不需要花费很多钱就可以改进的。足见这些缺点的存在，主要是由于工厂行政与工会负责人对有关工人健康的卫生问题，缺少应有的注意。所检查的工厂中，特别是私营达生纱厂，卫生设备极差。该厂三百九十名职工，男女厕所现在能用的只有两个，楼下的人要跑到三层楼上去大小便，马桶粘满粪便，手纸满地，其脏臭难以涉足。华北猪鬃公司的卫生情况则更为严重。厂房内工作人员过多，猪鬃未经水洗即送厂内整理；以致灰尘如雾，腥臭难闻。现全厂一千一百五十个工人中，即有三十三人吐血，三十二人患气喘，六人患全身发肿，因病歇工的有七十余人，患咳嗽者更为普遍。
    李立三部长于听取汇报后，指出造成目前工厂卫生问题非常严重的原因是：（一）过去官僚资本家根本不注意工人健康，或有意造成恶劣条件，如厕所设备肮脏简陋，以限制工人活动；私营企业亦然。（二）中国产业不发达，文化落后，一般缺少卫生常识和习惯。（三）工厂企业行政负责人或资方，对卫生问题缺少应有的重视，工会负责人没有注意督促行政方面和资方改善卫生条件，也没有在群众中进行卫生教育工作。李部长着重指出：第三点是主要原因，只有第三点改变了，才能逐渐克服第一、第二两个原因，而根本改善工厂卫生状况。目前此种严重现象恐不仅天津如此，因此，全国各地工厂企业均应引起注意。最后决定由检查组负责，于日内将此次考察报告整理出来，对各该工厂的安全卫生问题，提出具体改进意见。此外，并应分别草拟“工厂卫生条例”、“工厂卫生教育实施办法”、“工厂卫生组织条例”等交由各有关机关讨论批准施行。
