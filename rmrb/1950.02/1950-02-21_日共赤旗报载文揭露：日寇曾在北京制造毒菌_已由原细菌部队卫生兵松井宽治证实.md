Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, February 20th: Following the Soviet Union's publication of the indictment against Japanese bacteriological warfare criminals, new evidence has emerged regarding the Japanese army's preparation for bacteriological warfare. According to an article published in the Japanese Communist Party's central organ, Akahata, on January 10th, the Japanese army not only stationed bacteriological warfare units in Northeast China but also in Beijing, where they established a bacterial weapons cultivation facility. After Japan announced its surrender, this bacteriological warfare unit used trucks to transport and destroy 10,000 gasoline cans containing cultivated bacteria. According to Kanji Matsui (currently an executive committee member of the Kanagawa branch of the Japanese Electrical Industry Workers' Union), who was a medic in the unit at the time, during a visit to the Japanese Communist Party's Yoyogi Party Headquarters in Tokyo on January 9th, he recounted the situation as follows:

    "I was conscripted into the army and underwent three months of infantry training in Manchuria. In April of Showa 20 (Note: i.e., 1945), I was transferred to Beijing and assigned to the 1855 Unit, Shinoda Team, as a second-class medical soldier. This was the bacterial weapons research institute, primarily cultivating plague bacteria and fleas in preparation for war against the Soviet Union. This North China Expeditionary Army 1855 Unit belonged to the command of Lieutenant General Shigeru Hata, then commander-in-chief of the North China Expeditionary Army. The unit commander was former Surgeon Major General Eiji Nishimura. The headquarters was located near the Temple of Heaven, a scenic spot in Beijing. Ostensibly, it engaged in field water supply and infectious disease prevention. The work departments included the First Section (pathological testing), the Second Section (vaccine manufacturing), and the Third Section (bacterial weapons research institute). In addition to the headquarters in Beijing, the unit had branches in Kaifeng, Tianjin, Shijiazhuang, Zhangjiakou, Qingdao, Taiyuan, and other places, with a total personnel of over 1,000.

    The Third Section was located in the Jing Sheng Biological Research Institute, west of the Beijing National Library. Its work included: (1) mass production of fleas; (2) mass production of plague bacteria; (3) combining fleas and plague bacteria; and (4) aerial dissemination, etc. The leader of this team, Shinoda Osamu, was a professor at Kyoto Imperial University, a Doctor of Science, and a military advisor with the rank of Colonel. Under him were two medical officers, three military advisors with officer status, six medical non-commissioned officers, forty-five medical soldiers, three female military advisors, three non-commissioned officers, five Chinese coolies, and ten Japanese high school girls from Beijing.

    In the basement of the institute were a bacteria cultivation room, an animal room, a blowfly cultivation room, and a malaria research institute. The entire second floor was a flea cultivation room.

    The Third Section was further divided into the First Studio (flea production), the Second Studio (blowfly production, malaria research), the Third Studio (plague bacteria production), and the Small Animal (mouse) Room, depending on the content of the work. During working hours, the doors were always locked, and someone was always on guard. After work, back at the barracks, not a word about the work was allowed to be spoken. We were instructed that even if we encountered military police on Sundays and were asked about the unit, we should not answer truthfully...

    The development of fleas requires darkness, a temperature of 28 degrees Celsius, and 90% humidity. Therefore, the windows on the second floor of the research institute were always closed, and the inside of the glass was painted black, so the room was constantly dark. To maintain humidity, rags were hung from the ceilings of the corridors and each room, and sprayed with water every hour. Two inches of water were constantly stored on the floor. Steam valves attached to the steam pipes in each room continuously supplied steam into the rooms. The rooms were filled with steam all day long. Several rows of wooden shelves were placed in the rooms, on which were placed countless gasoline cans filled with fleas. Inside the cans were small cages containing mice, which served as food for the fleas. These mice, which were being sucked on by thousands of fleas, were given food every day. The mice died after four days to a week. Therefore, every morning, the dead mice were taken to the basement and used as food for the snake-breeding room.

    I heard that about a year before I was transferred to work in this unit, human experimentation had been carried out there, and two Chinese people were sacrificed as a result. Although the details of the experiment were unknown, it was said that the two Chinese people had their hands and feet tied, their mouths stuffed, and were transported from Beijing to the unit's base in trucks during the day, inside sacks. They died after a week.

    Furthermore, according to what I heard from Technician Ozaki, in 1942, fleas were mass-produced all night and transported outside. At the same time, it was said that an aerial experiment was conducted, and satisfactory results were obtained.

    On August 9th (Note: 1945), after the Soviet Union entered the war, the personnel of the Bacteriological Research Institute took up guns and went to the Zhangjiakou area, and work was suspended.

    Soon, on August 15th, the war ended. Twenty minutes after the midday radio broadcast that day, Captain Shinoda ordered the destruction of the Bacteriological Research Institute. The destruction work continued for three days and three nights, around the clock. A large pit was dug in the back garden. The fleas were first placed inside, and then gasoline was poured on them and burned. Important books and bacterial cultivation equipment were also destroyed. 10,000 gasoline cans used to cultivate fleas were transported away by truck.

    On the seventh day after the war ended, we finished the destruction work and gathered at the headquarters. At the same time, an order was given to disband the unit and remove the name "North China Epidemic Prevention and Water Supply Department" from the list of the North China Expeditionary Army. The officers and soldiers were all transferred to various army hospitals. ... In December of the same year, Captain Shinoda Osamu, Medical Captain Takaoka Mitsuru, and Military Technician Ozaki Shigeo resigned from the military, put on suits, grew their hair out, disguised themselves as Japanese residents, and returned to Japan on landing craft. Former Sergeant Major Tokioka Takashi was also transferred back to the infantry unit and returned to the country in November of the same year, mixed in with other troops. I was hospitalized with appendicitis in January 1946. After undergoing surgery, it became infected, and I remained bedridden until March, until April 4th of the same year. Therefore, I don't know what happened later. I'm afraid none of the cadres of that Bacteriological Research Institute became suspected war criminals, and they all returned to their country."

　　日共赤旗报载文揭露：日寇曾在北京制造毒菌
    已由原细菌部队卫生兵松井宽治证实
    【新华社北京二十日电】苏联发表了对日本细菌战犯的起诉书后，关于日军准备细菌战争的事实，又有新的证据。据日共中央机关报《赤旗》报一月十日载称，日军不只在东北，而且在北京也曾驻过细菌部队，设有细菌兵器的培养所。该细菌部队在日本宣布投降后，即用卡车把培养细菌的一万个汽油罐运走消毁。据该刊载当时在该部队当卫生兵的松井宽治（现任日本电器产业工会神奈川支部执行委员）于一月九日访问日共东京代代木党部，追述当时情形如下：
    “我应召入伍，在满洲受了三个月的步兵训练，于昭和二十年（注：即一九四五年）四月被调到北京，派入一八五五部队筱田队做卫生二等兵；这就是细菌兵器研究所，主要培养鼠疫菌和跳蚤，准备对苏作战。这个华北派遣军一八五五部队，是属于当时的华北派遣军总司令官前中将下村定指挥的部队长是前军医大佐西村英二，本部设在北京的名胜——天坛的近旁，表面上做的事情是野战供水和传染病预防。工作部门设有第一课（病理试验）、第二课（菌苗制造）、第三课（细菌兵器研究所）。这个部队除在北京设有本部外，并在开封、天津、石家庄、张家口、青岛、太原等地设有支所，部队全体人员在一千名以上。
    第三课设在北京国立图书馆西邻的静生生物调查所内，工作是：（一）大量生产跳蚤；（二）大量生产鼠疫菌；（三）结合跳蚤和鼠疫菌；（四）从飞机上撒布的工作等。这个队的队长筱田统，是京都帝国大学的教授、理学博士，是大佐待遇的军佐。在他的下面有军医将校二名、将校待遇军佐三名、卫生下士官六名、卫生兵四十五名、女子军佐三名、下士官三名、中国苦力五名，此外还有北京高等女子学校的日侨少女十名。
    在该所的地下室内，有细菌培养室、动物室、下苍蝇培养室、疟疾研究所；二楼全层是跳蚤培养室。
    第三课根据工作内容又分第一工作室（跳蚤的生产）、第二工作室（苍蝇的生产、疟疾研究）、第三工作室（鼠疫菌的生产）、小动物（鼠）室等。在工作时间内，总是在门内加锁，时常有人值班看守。工作完毕后回到营房，关于工作内容的话，是一句也不准讲的。上级吩咐过：星期天到外边走，即使遇到宪兵问起部队的内容，也不要照实回答。……
    跳蚤的发育需要黑暗及摄氏二十八度的气温和百分之九十的湿度，因此，研究所二楼的窗总是关起来的，玻璃的内侧涂上了黑漆，室内经常黑暗无光。为了保持湿度，在走廊和各房的天花板上，都吊着破布，每隔一小时喷雾一次，在地阶上经常贮有二英寸的水。附于各房的水蒸气管活瓣，不断输送水蒸气进房。房内整天都弥漫着水蒸气。房内摆有数列木棚，上面放着无数的汽油罐，罐内装满着跳蚤，在罐的里面，放有小笼，装着老鼠，做跳蚤的食饵。对于这些被几千个跳蚤吸血的老鼠，每天都给与食物。老鼠经过四天至一星期便死去，因此，每天早上都要将死老鼠拿到地下室去，做养蛇室的食饵。
    听说在我被调入该部队工作前约一年，那里曾进行过人身实验，有两个中国人因此被牺牲了。实验内容详细情形虽不得而知，但据说那两个中国人是手脚被绑起来，口里被塞着东西，被装在麻袋里面，在白画间，被用卡车从北京市内运到部队驻地，经过一个星期便死了。
    还有，据我从尾崎技师那里听到的话，在一九四二年，有一次曾通宵大量生产跳蚤，运到外面去；同时，据说曾举行过对空中实验，得到了圆满的结果。
    八月九日（注：一九四五年）苏联参战后，细菌研究所的人员都拿起枪出动到张家口方面去，工作停顿。
    不久，到八月十五日，战事便结束了。在那天正午的无线电广播二十分钟后，队长筱田便下令破坏细菌研究所。破坏工作继续了三天三晚，通宵达旦。在后园里挖了大坑，先把跳蚤放到里面去，然后洒上汽油焚烧。重要书籍和细菌培养器具也都被烧毁了。培养跳蚤的汽油罐一万个被卡车运走。
    战事结束后第七天，我们便做完了破坏工作，到本部集中。同时，又下令解散部队，把“北支那防疫供水部”的名称从华北派遣军的名册上涂去，所属官兵都转属到各陆军医院去。……同年十二月，队长筱田统、军医大尉高冈满和军佐技师尾崎繁雄三人脱离了军籍，穿起了西装，蓄起头发，扮成日侨，搭登陆艇回到日本；前兵曹长时冈孝也转归了步兵部队，同年十一月混入了其他部队回国。我在一九四六年一月因盲肠炎入医院，经施手术后化脓，直到三月尚在病榻上过日子，直至同年四月四日。因此后来的事情怎样，我便不得而知。那细菌研究所的干部恐怕没有一个成为战犯嫌疑犯，全体都回国了。”（附图片）
