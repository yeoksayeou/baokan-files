Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 15th—The person in charge of the Central Committee of the China New Democratic Youth League issued a statement in support of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance as follows:
　　The youth of China, with great excitement, support the signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance and the two agreements between China and the Soviet Union. We believe that this is an important event of worldwide significance, and the lasting world peace that the Chinese youth and the Chinese people yearn for will thus be more reliably guaranteed. The dream of the US imperialism and the Japanese ruling clique under its wing to invade China and alienate the friendly relations between China and the Soviet Union will thus suffer a crushing blow. These treaties and agreements will be of great help to the consolidation of our national defense and the restoration and development of our economic construction. The signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance and the two agreements further consolidated the friendship and cooperation between the Chinese and Soviet peoples. The Chinese youth deeply thank Marshal Stalin and Chairman Mao for their wise decisions and correct leadership. In addition to expressing our sincere support for this new Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance and other agreements, the China New Democratic Youth League calls on all its members and the broad masses of young people to work diligently with the people of the whole country, and actively work for the restoration and development of the country's various undertakings, and build our country into a strong and prosperous New China; and strengthen internationalist propaganda and education, and work together with the Soviet people, the people of the new democratic countries, the people of the colonial and semi-colonial countries, and the working people of the imperialist countries for the victory of the cause of lasting world peace and people's democracy.
