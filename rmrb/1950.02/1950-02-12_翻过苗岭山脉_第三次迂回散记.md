　　Crossing the Miao Mountain Range
    ——Random Notes on the Third Flanking Maneuver
    Chuan Ruo
    During the Guangxi campaign, our unit once again undertook a flanking mission. This was the third time since the crossing of the Yangtze River. Like the previous missions, this one was extremely arduous. Pursuing the enemy for over a thousand *li*, crossing the Miao Mountain Range on the border of Hunan, Guangxi, and Guizhou provinces, this vast mountainous area stretching for hundreds of *li*: sparsely populated, with language barriers, lack of provisions, and unclear roads… All kinds of difficulties were concentrated and placed before us. But all the commanders and fighters knew that this was Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu's order, that this was another surprise attack directly commanded by Commander Lin, and that this was the sacred task of liberating the people of Guangxi. Finally, with an iron will, they overcame all difficulties and, at an astonishing speed, rushed to the designated location and annihilated the enemy. As stated in the commendation order of Commanders Lin, Tan, and Xiao: "In carrying out the great flanking encirclement and the fierce pursuit, with fearless courage, you conquered the mountains, rivers, mud, hunger, and unbearable fatigue, creating a miracle of bravery."
    “Big Mountains, Big Determination”
    The Miao Mountains are also called the Cloud and Mist Mountains. No one who has passed through knows how high they are, because people climb in the clouds and mist, usually unable to see the distant scenery. So, the soldiers used the amount of sweat they produced to calculate the size of the mountains. Everyone called a mountain that caused one or two *liang* of sweat a small mountain (about five to ten *li*), a mountain that caused three or four *liang* of sweat a medium mountain (about ten to twenty *li*), and a mountain where sweat completely soaked the clothes a large mountain (about twenty to forty *li*). These mountains were one after another, just down one and then up another. According to statistics, there were twenty-five medium-sized or larger mountains. The mountain slopes were very steep, even up to sixty degrees or more, requiring crawling on all fours. The soldiers said: "In the past, when we talked about climbing mountains, we were actually just walking with our feet, which could only be considered walking on mountains. This time, we are really climbing mountains!" But not a single complaint was heard. All day long, the sound of slogans resounded throughout the mountains, such as: "Big mountains, big determination! No matter how high, we are not afraid!" "Liberate all of Guangxi! Capture Bai Chongxi alive!"
    “Like Thunder”
    According to the local indigenous people, only two armies had ever passed through this place. The first time was more than ten years ago, when a small number of Red Army soldiers reached some areas. The other time was during the late stage of the Anti-Japanese War, when some defeated Kuomintang soldiers came through. However, for a massive army with thousands of soldiers and horses, carrying artillery, to pass through here was unprecedented.
    The road was really too small and too dangerous. Sometimes there was simply no road, or the mountain had collapsed, making it impossible to pass. So, explosives had to be used to open the road, and then there would be deafening explosions that shook the mountains. The comrades in the vanguard unit said: "This is louder than the sound of howitzers, just like thunder."
    To facilitate the passage of the army, the engineers endured hunger and cold, repaired the road overnight in the rain, and even jumped into the icy water to build bridges. The troops shouted slogans: "Learn from the engineer comrades!"
    Serving the People Wholeheartedly
    It rained every day, and the clothes were soaked inside and out. The roads were muddy and slippery, and most of the shoes were ruined. To reduce falls, everyone used a wooden stick and formed "mutual support groups" to strengthen organizational strength. When passing through dangerous places, commanders stood aside to tell how to walk. Everyone watched each other and walked carefully. Even so, many people still fell. But they got up after falling, and everyone cursed the enemy: "Bai Chongxi, we must kill this guy if we catch him!" Some said: "Serving the people is at times like this!" "Celebrate the founding of the People's Republic of China and firmly establish a meritorious service to commemorate the founding!"
    Without houses, some troops sat on their backpacks and held up umbrellas, spending the night in the rain. They also held discussion meetings to commend the marching models of the day and study the experience of climbing mountains and walking in mud and rain.
    Walking at night was even more difficult. A certain company once used tea cups as lamps for light, but they consumed seven *jin* of oil in two hours, which was unaffordable. So, they held hands, pulling each other, and groped forward slowly. They only walked twenty *li* in one night.
    One Horse, Three *Jin* of Flour
    Due to the high mountains and dangerous roads, horses were difficult to travel, and the death of horses increased day by day. The military headquarters decided to leave the horses behind to find other roads. Only Commissar Xing's horse from the guard battalion came. This horse did not come easily. It was dragged over by the guards with great effort. Whenever it came to steep cliffs, the horse was so frightened that it trembled all over. The soldiers tied ropes to the horse and held it behind to slowly lower it down.
    One night, we camped in Aodong (place name). Because no grain was bought, the guards habitually wore wet clothes and leaned on each other to sleep. At this time, the platoon leader of the signal platoon stood up and said: "Comrades! These days have been very difficult. We are not eating enough and not sleeping well. Everyone gave the blanket they carried to the commander to show they care! But now there is not even fire. We should pick up some firewood and dry our clothes to restore our strength." After speaking, they went out to pick up firewood. At this time, Education Commissar Xing Shangshan suddenly came in from outside, holding several large cakes in his hands, specially to give to the commander. It turned out that these were made from three *jin* of white flour that he had brought on his horse. The director of the political department distributed them to everyone. Everyone who ate them felt too unexpected and too lucky.
    “Taiping Army” and “Natural Association”
    In the Miao Mountain area live the Miao people, as well as Yao, Zhuang, Zhong, Li, and Liao ethnic groups. To prevent the invasion of jackals, wolves, and leopards, they set up bamboo spikes near their dwellings in winter, and from then on, even they themselves did not come out. They had no written language and spoke various dialects. Only a few interpreters could say a few Chinese characters, but under the deception of the reactionary rulers of past dynasties, they habitually wrote "Yao," "Zhuang," "Zhong," and "Liao" as "猺," "獞," "狆," and "獠." Their living conditions were very backward. Due to malnutrition and not seeing the sun for many years, most of them were yellow-faced, emaciated, and had many diseases.
    Here, according to the instructions of the political department, we carried out education to unite the minority ethnic groups. According to the special circumstances of the area, all transactions were carried out with silver dollars. We did not take a single needle or thread from the Miao people. If we could not buy food, we would rather go hungry. If the residents were unwilling to let us into their houses, we could only camp in the open. We also carried out extensive propaganda work. As a result, the Miao people generally returned to their homes and took care of our army. They also helped our army lead the way and repair the roads. The Miao people in the Congjiang area also organized a support-the-front organization called the "Natural Association." They mobilized the nearby Miao people to transport grain and sell it to our army from dozens of *li* away and distributed our propaganda materials. From then on, the relationship between the Miao people and us became even better. Some Miao women even secretly took out their tattered quilts and covered our soldiers after they fell asleep. The Miao people called the People's Liberation Army the "Taiping Army." According to the translator's explanation, the "Natural Association" meant that helping the army was entirely voluntary by the Miao people, and everyone could be at peace. The "Taiping Army" meant that the army passing through this time was safe and loved the people. Later, there would be peace in the world.
    “Let Me Carry You Over!”
    The terrain of Guangxi had not been accurately measured, and the military maps had reduced effectiveness. According to the map, there were many villages, but in reality, there were none. There were no large mountains on the map, but in reality, there were very large mountains. It was often impossible to find a place to camp. To adapt to this situation, the military leaders and the section chiefs and staff officers of the headquarters often walked ahead of the troops to investigate the situation and arrange for camping. If they encountered bamboo spikes of the Miao people or other reasons that made it impossible to pass, they had to turn back and find another way.
    The army commander was a man who had lost his health due to multiple bleeding incidents, and the army political commissar was also extremely weak. Once, the army chief of staff waded through a mountain flood wearing his clothes, and was knocked down by the rapid current. His clothes were completely wet. At this time, Sun Chengbeng, an editor from the newspaper, took off his clothes, stood in the water, and said to the director of the political department: "Let me carry you over!" But the military leaders and soldiers alike waded through the rapids in the biting cold water. The leaders often talked about the story of the Red Army passing through the Miao Mountains more than ten years ago. Those who heard it gained new strength.
    Six Days Without Eating
    The drivers had the greatest difficulties. Whenever they passed through narrow roads, they organized and escorted the pack horses one by one. If the horse was stuck in the mud or fell into a ditch, they had to all help to rescue it. The cooks and transporters, carrying heavy loads, moved forward slowly, with heat rising from their faces. The machine gunners and artillerymen carried their weapons and slowly crawled, sometimes only walking twenty or thirty *li* a day. But their spirits were very high. For example, a mountain artillery battalion of a certain division had not eaten for six days in a row, but completed its glorious task. A certain regiment also maintained its full strength during a month of arduous and extraordinary combat operations.
    Appeared West of Liuzhou
    The Jiang-Li-Bai bandit army never dreamed that we would fly out of this large mountainous area. By the time they discovered us, we were advancing rapidly like tigers descending the mountain, at a speed of a hundred *li* a day. One night, we suddenly appeared on the Guizhou-Guangxi Road west of Liuzhou. The enemy was at a loss and fled in panic. Our army took the abandoned cars of the enemy and tracked them down. The remnants of the enemy's 17th Army Corps stationed in Jinchengjiang did not have time to escape and were caught by us. Thousands of people were captured, and batches of general-level officers surrendered. Our army seized a large amount of supplies, with more than 600 telephone switchboards alone. We had more cars, so we launched a more fierce multi-pronged pursuit. In just a few days, we chased all the way to Baise on the border of Yunnan and Guangxi. Most of the mountainous area in northwestern Guangxi was under our control. Guilin, Liuzhou, and Nanning were all far behind our army. The enemy's back door for escaping to Yunnan was blocked. The Bai Chongxi bandit army was thus trapped in our large encirclement and annihilated. The commanders and fighters laughed and completed the arduous task of long-distance flanking, creating a great victory of historical significance.

　　翻过苗岭山脉
    ——第三次迂回散记
    川若
    在广西战役中，我们部队又担负迂回任务，这是渡江作战以来的第三次，这个任务和过去一样，是非常艰巨的。追击一千余里，翻过湘桂黔边境的苗岭大山脉，这个绵亘数百里的庞大山区：人烟稀少，语言不通，粮草缺乏，道路不明……各种困难，集中起来摆到我们面前。但全体指战员们，知道这是毛主席朱总司令的命令，知道这是林司令员直接指挥下的又一次奇兵，知道这是解放广西人民的神圣的任务。终于以钢铁的意志排除万难，以惊人的速度，一直奔向指定位置，歼灭了敌人。正如林、谭、萧首长的嘉奖令中所说：“在进行大的迂回包围和猛追穷追的行动中，以奋不顾身的勇气，战胜了大山，河川，泥泞，饥饿和难以忍受的疲乏，创造出神勇的奇迹。”
    “山大决心大”
    苗岭又叫云雾山，究竟有多高，过来的人谁也不知道，因为人在云雾中攀登，通常看不见远景，于是战士们就用自己身上出汗的程度来计算山的大小，大家把累出一两身汗的山叫小山（约五里至十里），出三四身大汗的山叫中等山（约十里至二十里），汗水把衣服全部湿透的山叫大山（约二十里至四十里）。这些山一个接着一个，刚刚下去又得上，据统计，中等以上的大山，共走了二十五座。山势很陡，甚至到六十度以上，必须四肢爬行，战士们说：“过去说爬山，其实都是用两脚走路，只能算走山，这回可真是爬山啦！”但听不到一句怨言，整天所听到的是漫山遍野的鼓动口号，如：“山大决心大！再高也不怕！”“解放全广西！活捉白崇禧！”
    “和打雷一样”
    据当地土人说：这地方只走过两次队伍，第一次是十多年前有些地方到过少数红军，另一次是抗战后期国民党有些溃兵来过。千军万马，浩浩荡荡，带着大炮从这里经过，却是开天辟地以来的第一次。
    路实在太小了，太险了，有时简直没有路，或者山崩路坍，无法通过，就得用炸药开路，于是震天巨响，撼动山岳。前卫部队的同志们说：“这比榴弹炮的声音还大，就和打雷一样。”
    为了便利大军的通过，工兵们忍饥耐寒，连夜冒雨抢修，甚至跳进冰冷的水里架桥，部队里喊出口号：“向工兵同志学习！”
    全心全意为人民服务
    天天下雨，衣服里外都湿透了。道路泥滑，鞋子大部完了。为了减少跌交，每人都拄一根木棍，并成立“互架组”，以加强组织力量。通过险要的地方，指挥员站在一旁，告诉如何走法。大家一个看着一个，小心谨慎地走着，即使如此，跌倒者仍然很多。但跌倒又爬起来，大家咒骂敌人：“白崇禧这小子捉住他非杀他不可！”也有的说：“为人民服务，就在这个时候！”“庆祝中华人民共和国成立，坚决立下开国纪念功！”
    没有房子，有的部队就坐上背包撑起雨伞，在雨中过夜。并开讨论会，表扬当天的行军模范。研究在泥雨中爬山走路的经验。
    夜间走路，困难更多。某连曾以茶缸子代灯取亮，但两个钟头点了七斤油，消耗不起，就手牵手人拉人，慢慢地摸索着前进。一夜只走了二十里路。
    一匹马，三斤面
    由于山高路险，马匹难行，马的死亡逐日增加，军部便决定把马留在后面另寻道路。军政治部只来了邢干事的一匹马。这匹马来得不易，是警卫营的战士用九牛二虎之力硬拖过来的。每至陡崖险岭，马被吓得浑身发抖，战士们就把马身上拴起绳子，在后面拖住，慢慢地放了下去。
    有一天晚上，宿营于坳洞（地名）。因为没有买到粮食，警卫员们就照例地穿着湿衣服，相互倚靠而卧。这时警通排长站起来说：“同志们！这几天很艰苦，吃不饱，睡不好。首长的马没有来，大家背来的一床毯子让给首长。爱护首长，这是值得表扬的！但现在连火都没有，我们还是拣些柴火，烤干衣服才能恢复疲劳。”说完就纷纷出去拾柴草。这时教育干事邢上善同志忽从外面进来，两手端着几个大饼子，特来送给首长。原来这是他的马上带的三斤白面制成的。政治部主任就分给大家吃，吃到的人都觉着太意外太幸运了。
    “太平军”和“自然会”
    在苗岭山区里，住着苗人，有苗、徭、僮、仲、黎、僚等族。他们为了防备豺狼虎豹的侵袭，到了冬天，就在住地附近，遍设竹尖，从此连他们自己也不出来了。他们没有文字，说着各种土话。只有少数通司，略说几句汉字，但他们却在历代反动派统治的欺骗下，习惯地把“徭”“僮”“仲”“僚”，写作“猺”“獞”“狆”“獠”。他们的生活状态非常落后，因为营养不足和长年不见太阳，大都面黄饥瘦，疾病很多。
    在这里，我们依照政治部的指示，进行团结少数民族的教育。根据当地的特殊情况，买卖一律用现洋交易。不动苗民一针一线。买不到粮食就宁愿挨饿。居民不肯让进房子就只有露营。并普遍开展宣传工作。结果苗民普遍回到自己家里，照应我军。并帮助我军带路，修路。从江一带的苗民还组织了一种支前机构，名叫“自然会”。动员附近的苗民从数十里以外，运粮卖给我军。把我们的宣传品散发出去。从此苗民和我们的关系更好了，甚至有的苗妇，在我们的战士睡着后，还偷偷拿出他们的破烂被子给盖上。苗民们把人民解放军称为“太平军”。据通司解释：“自然会”的意思是帮助军队完全出于苗人自愿，而且使大家得到安然；“太平军”是说这次过的军队平安无事，爱护百姓。以后就要天下太平了。
    “我把你背过去吧！”
    广西的地形，没有经过确实的测量，军用地图也减低了效用。从图上看有很多村落，实际上却没有。图上没有大山，实际上却有很大的山。常常弄得无法宿营。为了适应这种情况，军首长及司令部的科长参谋，常常走在部队的先头，调查情况布置宿营。如果碰到苗人的竹尖或其他原因不能通过时，就得转回来另找出路。
    军长是因流血多次失去健康的人，军政治委员也极瘦弱。有一次，军参谋长穿着衣服徒涉山洪，被急流冲倒，衣服尽湿，这时报社编辑孙成本同志脱下衣服站在水里，对政治部主任说：“我把你背过去吧！”但是军首长和战士们一样在刺骨的冷水中，徒涉冲过急流。首长们不时谈论十多年前红军经过苗岭的故事。听到的人，又增加了新的力量。
    六天没有吃饭
    驭手的困难最大了，每在通过隘路时，他们组织起来，把驮马一匹一匹护送过去，如果马陷在泥里或掉在沟里，就得全部下手营救。炊事员和运输员们，背着沉重的担子，慢慢的前进，脸上都冒着热气。机枪射手和机炮兵们，扛起自己的武器，慢慢爬行，有时一天只走二三十里。但他们的精神十分旺盛。如某师山炮营先后曾有六天没吃上饭，但完成了自己的光荣任务。某团在艰苦卓绝的一个月战斗行动中，也保持了满员。
    出现在柳州以西
    蒋李白匪军梦想不到我们会从这大山区里飞过来，及至被他们发觉了之后，我们就以猛虎下山，一日百里的速度急进。在一个晚上突然出现在柳州以西的黔桂路上。敌人手足无措，仓惶逃窜。我军坐上敌人丢弃的汽车跟踪追击。住在金城江的敌十七兵团残部，没有来得及逃跑，被我一把抓住，数千人当了俘虏，成批的将校级军官都束手就俘。我军缴获大量物资，仅电话总机即达六百余部。我们的汽车更多起来，于是更猛烈地展开多路追击。不到几天，就一直追到滇桂边境的百色。整个桂西北山区大部为我控制。桂林、柳州、南宁，都远远地扔在我军的背后。敌人向云南逃跑的后门被塞死了。白崇禧匪军就这样陷在我军大包围里被歼灭了。指战员们欢笑着，完成了远距离迂回的艰巨任务，创造了具有历史意义的伟大胜利。
