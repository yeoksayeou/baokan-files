Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 3rd.  Railway workers and staff of the Tianjin, Jinan and other railway administrations are enthusiastically responding to the directives and notices of the Central People's Government's Government Administration Council and the CPC Central Committee to ensure the realization of the Ministry of Railways' 1950 work plan. The Tianjin Bureau's Political Department, Trade Union, and Youth League Working Committee have all convened meetings to discuss the plan, or have issued instructions calling on workers and staff to ensure the successful completion of this year's glorious railway construction and transportation tasks. In preparation for the 1950 work plan, the bureau convened various meetings as early as November of last year to initially determine future work plans and reward "heroes." Currently, each station section has successively proposed specific guarantees for completing the plan. The East Station guarantees to maintain a record of only nine minutes for freight car turnaround time this year. The Railway Machinery Factory has set the number of vehicles to be repaired this year, guaranteeing a doubling compared to last year. The Transportation Section decided to continue improving on the 300,000-kilometer safe driving record completed last month. The Fengtai Transportation Section guarantees to achieve one million pieces of escorted goods without accidents. The Jinan Railway Administration has also convened a meeting to convey the 1950 work plan. Attendees included heads of various sub-bureaus, responsible cadres from Communist Party organizations and trade unions, and engineers. They all expressed their determination to mobilize the broad masses of workers and staff to strive to complete and exceed the tasks. The Ministry of Railways' 1950 work plan is currently being hotly discussed among workers and staff. In addition, the responsible person of the CPC Xuzhou Sub-bureau Committee of the Tianjin-Pukou Railway also stated that they would definitely mobilize all Party members to take the lead and ensure the completion of the tasks assigned by the Ministry of Railways.
