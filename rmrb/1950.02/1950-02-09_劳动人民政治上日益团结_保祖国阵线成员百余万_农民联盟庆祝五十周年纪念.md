Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, February 8th - TASS, Sofia: Two years have passed since the establishment of the Bulgarian Fatherland Front (note: the Fatherland Front Committee Congress adopted the Fatherland Front Charter in January 1948).

    The Fatherland Front newspaper wrote: This unified, mass social and political organization already has eight thousand branches, with a total membership of over one million one hundred thousand. In the past two years, in addition to members of various political parties, four hundred thousand citizens who had never participated in the country's political and social life have joined the Fatherland Front. The brilliant victory won by the Fatherland Front in the December 18th election vividly demonstrated the political maturity of the Bulgarian laboring people and their increasing spiritual and political unity.

    Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, February 8th - Telecommunications Agency, Sofia: The Bulgarian Farmers' Union held its fiftieth anniversary celebration on the 29th. Chervenkov, secretary of the Bulgarian Communist Party, and members of the Politburo attended. The venue was filled with farmers wearing brightly colored national costumes. The conference took Chervenkov's words as its slogan: "Let us do our best to maintain the fighting alliance of the working class and the working farmers, and take it as the backbone of the people's democratic country!"

    Trakov, General Secretary of the Farmers' Union and Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers, said in his speech: A review of the history of the Farmers' Union shows that the Union has now learned from past mistakes—non-cooperation with workers and the policy of absorbing landlords into the Union. He pointed out: The Farmers' Union should be an organization of poor and small-property farmers, without a place for rich peasants. The Farmers' Union recognizes that the leadership of the working class and the Communist Party is the basic condition for developing towards socialism, and guarantees to devote all its efforts to the construction of socialism.

    Chervenkov congratulated the conference on behalf of the Bulgarian Communist Party, saying: "The best commemoration of the fiftieth anniversary of the Farmers' Union is to learn from past mistakes. The construction of a socialist society will further consolidate our unity." The conference sent telegrams of respect to Stalin and the Standing Committee of the Paris World Peace Congress.

    保祖国阵线成员百余万
    农民联盟庆祝五十周年纪念
    【新华社北京八日电】塔斯社索非亚讯：保加利亚祖国阵线建立以来，已届两周年（按：祖国阵线委员会代表大会于一九四八年一月通过祖国阵线章程）。
    祖国阵线报撰文称：这个统一的、群众性的社会与政治组织，已经有了八千个分会，其成员共达一百一十万余人。在两年当中，除了各个政党的党员之外，已有四十万从未参与过国家的政治与社会生活的公民，加入了祖国阵线。祖国阵线在去年十二月十八日的选举中所赢得的辉煌胜利，生动地表明了保加利亚劳动人民政治上的成熟，以及他们在精神上和政治上的日益团结。
    【新华社北京八日电】电通社索非亚讯：保加利亚农民联盟二十九日举行五十周年纪念大会。保共书记契尔文科夫及政治局委员均往参加。会场上满坐身着鲜艳民族服装的农民。大会以契尔文科夫的话作为口号：“让我们全力维持工人阶级及劳动农民的战斗联盟，把它作为人民民主国家的脊梁！”
    农民联盟总书记、部长会议副主席特莱科夫演说称：检讨农民联盟的历史，说明联盟现在已从过去的错误——与工人的不合作及吸收地主入盟的政策——中吸取教训。他指出：农民联盟应该是贫苦的和有少许财产的农民的组织，其中没有富农的地位。农民联盟承认：工人阶级与共产党的领导，是向社会主义发展的基本条件，并保证以全力从事社会主义的建设。
    契尔文科夫代表保加利亚共产党向大会祝贺称：“对农民联盟成立五十周年最好的纪念，便是从过去的错误中学习。社会主义社会的建设，将进一步巩固我们的团结。”大会致电斯大林及巴黎世界拥护和平大会常设委员会致敬。
