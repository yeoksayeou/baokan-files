　　Changing the Backward Locomotive Depot
    Introduction to the Nancha Locomotive Depot Branch
    The Nancha Locomotive Depot Branch of the Harbin Railway Bureau of the Northeast Railway Bureau was selected as a model branch of the Harbin Bureau and was rewarded at the political work conference of the Northeast Railway Bureau. The reason why this branch was selected as a model is mainly because it came up with various ways to transform the backward Nancha Locomotive Depot into an advanced locomotive depot, ensuring the completion of production tasks.
    In the past, the Nancha Locomotive Depot was a well-known backward depot. There was a wrong slogan for locomotive repair: "Major repairs cannot be done, minor repairs will have to do." Therefore, when repairing locomotives, the problems might be made even worse. At this time, there was no Party foundation in the locomotive depot. After Comrades Xi Neng'an, the military representative, and Li Nailing, the depot chief, were transferred to the depot in 1947, they began to pay attention to Party building. They successively developed 21 Party members in various movements and established a branch. As a result, the Party systematically led employees to study, which improved their work enthusiasm. The branch also suggested to the administration to carry out personnel adjustments, promote outstanding workers to be cadres, and encourage the production enthusiasm of the masses. A new atmosphere was revealed in the business.
    With Communist Party members, there is the power to overcome all difficulties
    When the higher authorities called for the adoption of a system of guaranteed repair, guaranteed inspection, and guaranteed responsible operation, the branch cooperated in carrying out propaganda and mobilization work in each car group, calling on everyone to resolutely implement the guaranteed operation system. Among them, the No. 1124 locomotive group did the best. The quality of this locomotive was not very good, especially the running gear had many problems and made a clanging noise when running; the journal bearing was also prone to overheating, and the axle (oil type) had to be changed every station. However, among the nine crew members of this locomotive group, there were already five Communist Party members, which was the leading force to overcome these difficulties. During the discussion of the implementation of the guaranteed operation system in the locomotive group, some crew members said: "I have been working on the railway for so many years, and I have never heard that crew members also repair trains!" Some said: "How can crew members do this work?" At this time, the Party members used the difficulties of not being able to repair trains in the past to persuade everyone: Once, when the locomotive was running to Hegang, when the train arrived at Heli, although the right water pump was full of water, it was gushing out from the overflow pipe, and everyone knew where the problem was, but they didn't know how to repair it. Fortunately, there was only one station left from Heli to Hegang, and the left water pump could barely run. When it arrived at Hegang for repairs, it was repaired in a short time. Speaking of this, everyone felt hot on their faces. At this time, they realized that the crew members needed to understand some methods of checking and repairing locomotives, otherwise they would be at a loss when problems occurred on the way. In March 1948, when the locomotive was scheduled for inspection, the entire No. 1124 locomotive group participated in the repair work.
    Learning business without being greedy, establishing a division of labor and responsibility learning system
    When learning repair at the beginning, Party members always rushed to repair the difficult ones, and everyone was very moved, so their learning enthusiasm was even higher. However, due to the lack of planning and organization in learning, whoever was interested in what work would learn what. As a result, most people learned the repair of the braking system. When the locomotive broke down, they did not dare to repair it. At this time, the Party小组 (small group) proposed: to establish a division of labor and responsibility learning system, each holding a door without being greedy, learning one thing and then learning another; when the locomotive broke down, it would be repaired by the person responsible for learning. In this way, everyone had their own responsibilities, and the learning progress was very fast. The No. 1124 locomotive ran from March 1948 to March 1949, and never had a locomotive damage accident, safely running 85,291 kilometers. They won the honorary title of "Three Guarantees Pioneers" at the Harbin Bureau celebration meeting on April 15.
    At this time, the branch promoted the experience of the No. 1124 locomotive group to the entire depot, and also equipped several other locomotives with Party members and organized Party small groups. Another locomotive was contracted to the Communist Youth League members, and a Youth League group was established. Now, among the crew members of the entire depot, more than 15% can do Class B inspection, and 80% can do Class C repair.
    Rectifying the organization to solve the difficulty of crew members not being able to attend small group meetings
    At the same time, the branch carried out daily propaganda and education work for non-Party members. Jie Enrong, the driver of locomotive No. 88, relied on his technical skills and looked down on people. The branch studied the method of education and transformation: it found four Party members to help him progress, first respecting his skills, obeying his assignments, and on the other hand, persuading and educating him based on his shortcomings, and the result was very good. Jie Enrong also proposed to catch up with the No. 1124 locomotive group. In the late Red May, the locomotive group he led completed the Class B and C inspection three guarantees system. He himself was also admitted to the Party and became a glorious Communist Party member. Criticism and self-criticism and strict organizational life exercises were further carried out within the Party. The organizational life of the transportation department in the entire depot was the most lax. Because of the flow of work, Party members could not often get together, and small group meetings and learning could not be carried out. After research by the branch committee, the 38 Party members in the transportation department were divided into six groups, with the four drivers on duty and the two crew chiefs serving as the group leaders. Other crew members had two small group meetings per month, and each meeting was held on two days, so that the crew members could participate in the small group meetings without hindering their work. The difficulty that crew members could not attend meetings in the past was overcome.
    The branch calls on Party members to learn technology
    The branch also called on Party members to learn from veteran technical workers. There are two veteran meritorious workers in the Nancha Locomotive Depot—Zhao Guoxing (50 years old) and Wang Lanting (63 years old). The branch educated Party members to invite them to participate in the research work and express more opinions. This way they can learn more technology. And let the masses recognize the glory of the meritorious workers and improve the mood of making meritorious service. The meritorious workers also have a further understanding of the Party, and they rely more closely on the Party. A branch committee member also personally took the lead in repairing the house for Wang Lanting, painting it with white ash, and building a heated kang, which moved the old meritorious worker to actively take apprentices.

　　改变了落后的机务段
    南叉机务段支部介绍
    东北铁路局哈尔滨局南叉机务段支部，被选为哈尔滨局模范支部，并在东北铁路局的政治工作会议上，受到了奖励。这个支部所以能被选为模范，主要是因为它想出了各种办法，将落后的南叉机务段改造为先进的机务段，保证了生产任务的完成。
    从前南叉机务段是有名的落后段，对机车检修就有这么一个错误口号：“大活不能干、小活将就走”。因此修机车时说不定反把毛病弄得更大。这时机务段上还没有党的基础。一九四七年军事代表奚能安段长李乃林两同志调到段上后，开始注意建党，先后在各种运动中发展了二十一名党员，建立了支部。由此，党就有计划有步骤的带领员工学习，提高了劳动热情。支部又建议行政上，进行人事调整，提拔了优秀的工人当干部，鼓舞了群众生产情绪，业务上显露出一股新的气象。
    有了共产党员就有了克服一切困难的力量
    当上级号召采用包修、包检、包乘负责制的时候，支部就配合在每一个包车组里进行了宣传鼓动工作，号召大家坚决执行包乘制。其中以一一二四号机车组作得最好，这台机车的质量是不大好的，特别是走行部的毛病很大，走起来叮当乱响；大轴也好发热，走一站一换轴（油型）。但是这个机车组的九名乘务员里，已经有了五名共产党员，这就是克服这些困难的领导力量。在机车组讨论实行包乘制办法时，有些乘务员说：“我在铁路上干了这些年，从没有听说乘务员还带修车的！”又有的说：“乘务员那能干这个活儿？”这时党员们就用过去不会修车的难处来说服大家：有次机车跑鹤岗，车到鹤力的时候，右边水泵虽然上满了水，但从溢水管往外冒水，大家也知道毛病所在，就是不会修理。好在从鹤力到鹤岗，还剩一站地，用左边水泵也还勉强能走。到鹤岗入场修理，一会工夫就修好了。说起这件事，大伙脸上都觉着热呼呼的。这时候才觉着乘务员们是需要懂得一些检查和修理机车的办法，不然在途中出了毛病，就束手无策。一九四八年三月间，机车定检的时候，一一二四号机车组全组就参加了检修工作。
    学习业务不贪多，建立分工负责学习制
    在初学检修的时候，党员总是抢着难修的来修理，大家很受感动，因此学习情绪更高。但因学习缺乏计划，缺乏组织，谁对什么活儿有兴趣，谁就学什么。结果大多数学了修理制动部分。当机车发生了故障，又不敢动手修理。这时党的小组提出：建立分工负责的学习制度，各抱一门不贪多，学会一样再学一样；机车出了故障时，就由学习的负责修理。这样每个人都各有专责，学习进度很快。一一二四号机车从一九四八年三月走到一九四九年三月，从来没有发生机车破损事故，安全走行了八万五千二百九十一公里。他们在四月十五日哈尔滨局庆功会上，获得了“三包先锋”的光荣称号。
    这时，支部就把一一二四号机车组的经验向全段推广，并且把另外几台机车，也都配备起党员，组织党小组。又有一台机车包给了青年团员，成立了青年组。现在全段的乘务员中，百分之十五以上的人都能做乙检，百分之八十的人都能做丙种检修。
    整顿组织解决乘务员不能参加小组会的困难
    支部同时对非党群众进行了日常的宣传教育工作。八十八号机车司机长解恩荣自恃有点技术，瞧不起人。支部研究了教育改造的办法：找了四名党员去帮助他进步，首先尊重他的技术，服从他的分配，另一方面针对他的缺点，进行说服教育，结果转变得很好。解恩荣还提出要赶上一一二四号机车组。在红五月下旬里他所带的机车组，就完成了乙丙检三包制。他自己也被吸收入党，当了一名光荣的共产党员。在党内更是展开了批评与自我批评与严格组织生活锻炼。全段中以运转部门的组织生活最松懈。因为工作流动，党员们经常聚不到一块儿，小组会、学习都无法进行。经过支委会研究，把运转部门三十八个党员划分为六个组，组长以值班司机四名，乘务组长二名来担任。其他乘务员每月两次小组会，每一次会分两天开，使得乘务员既能参加小组会，又不妨碍工作。克服了过去乘务员不能参加会的困难。
    支部号召党员，学习技术
    支部还号召党员，向老年技术工人学习。南叉机务段有两位老功臣—赵国兴（五十岁）和王兰亭（六十三岁）。支部就教育党员，在研究工作时要请他们参加，多发表意见。这样能多学技术。并且使群众认识功臣的光荣，提高立功情绪。功臣对党也有更进一步的认识，他们更紧紧靠着党。有个支委还亲自带头给王兰亭修房子，刷上白灰，搭上火炕，感动得老功臣更加积极带徒弟。
