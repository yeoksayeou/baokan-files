Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 20th -- The news of Chairman Mao and Premier Zhou's return home from the Soviet Union has brought new joy to people across the country celebrating the Spring Festival. The special edition of the Beijing People's Daily, which published this news, was quickly sold out. Citizens were telling each other, "Chairman Mao is coming back soon!" Everyone was calculating the day when their leader would arrive in the capital. On the 20th, Beijing and Tianjin newspapers published this news in the most prominent position on the front page, along with Chairman Mao's farewell speech before leaving Moscow. When the news reached Dalian, cheers rang out in the streets and alleys. Wherever the propaganda vehicles distributing the special edition of the Lüda People's Daily went, people flocked to them. Those watching the Yangko dance stopped watching, and those lining up to buy tickets in front of the cinema also ran out of the line, all vying to read the special edition. Qiao Yufeng, a stoker at the locomotive section of the China Changchun Railway, grabbed a copy of the special edition and happily shouted about it everywhere, saying to his fellow workers, "Chairman Mao's trip to the Soviet Union has brought us many benefits! The friendship between China and the Soviet Union is permanent and inseparable. The Soviet Union has helped us greatly! In our China Changchun Railway, Soviet comrades have trained many Chinese technical talents!" Zheng Fude, a worker at the China Changchun Railway Factory, shouted loudly as soon as he saw the special edition: "Ah! Chairman Mao is back! Chairman Mao has taken care of everything we hoped for, this is a great happy event." Workers from enterprises such as the Western Liaoning Machinery Factory and the Jinzhou Electricity Company, after reading the special edition aloud, expressed that Chairman Mao went to the Soviet Union and accomplished many major things for the Chinese people, and that they must redouble their efforts in production to welcome him back home. After the Qingdao Daily issued the news of Chairman Mao's departure from the Soviet Union on the 18th, the Qingdao branch of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, the Qingdao Federation of Trade Unions, and the Qingdao Student Federation all issued written statements, unanimously expressing their greatest respect and gratitude to Chairman Mao. After the news of Chairman Mao and Premier Zhou's return home from the Soviet Union reached Xuzhou, all the workers, students, and citizens in the city crowded around the street radios, listening attentively. Liu Yuhai, a worker at the Jinpu Xuzhou locomotive section, said excitedly: "Chairman Mao signed the Sino-Soviet Friendship Treaty in the Soviet Union, which is a great happy event for the people of the whole country and the people of the whole world. We should work hard, otherwise we would be letting Chairman Mao down."
