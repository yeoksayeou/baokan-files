Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 15th -- Since the establishment of the national postal general bureau in the capital on New Year's Day this year, the national people's postal service has embarked on the road of unified management and comprehensive recovery. The postal services of various regions were originally led by the postal or posts and telecommunications management bureaus of the major administrative regions of Northeast, North China, Northwest, East China, and Central China. After the establishment of the General Post Office, the Northwest, East China, and Central China Post Office Management Bureaus were changed to Postal Sub-Bureaus, and their tasks were to supervise and inspect postal work in their jurisdictions and implement various tasks assigned by the General Bureau. The North China Post Office General Bureau was abolished, and the postal administrations of the provinces under its jurisdiction were directly under the leadership of the General Post Office. The Northeast Posts and Telecommunications Management Bureau was changed to the Postal and Telecommunications Sub-Bureau to facilitate professional development. The newly liberated areas in the Southwest separately established the Southwest Postal Sub-Bureau. At present, there are 29 postal districts under the unified leadership of the General Post Office: Beijing, Tianjin, Shanxi, and Pingyuan in North China; Shenyang, Changchun, Harbin, Qiqihar, and Jinzhou in Northeast China; Shaanxi, Northern Shaanxi, Gansu-Ningxia-Qinghai, and Xinjiang in Northwest China; Shanghai, Jiangsu, Shandong, Anhui, Zhejiang, and Fujian in East China; Henan, Hubei, Hunan, Jiangxi, Guangdong, and Guangxi in Central and South China; and Guizhou, Yunnan, Western Sichuan, and Eastern Sichuan in Southwest China. In addition, there is also an Inner Mongolia postal district temporarily led by the local government; the Taiwan postal district is still awaiting liberation.

Because of the rapid restoration of transportation in various places, letters can be exchanged between large and small cities and even villages throughout the country. Most large and medium-sized cities can also exchange parcels. As of January 19, the number of post offices that can exchange remittances throughout the country is 152 in the Northeast, 451 in North China, 809 in East China, 454 in Central and South China, and 135 in Northwest China, for a total of 2,001. The newly liberated postal districts of Guangdong, Guangxi, Guizhou, Yunnan, Western Sichuan, Eastern Sichuan, and Xinjiang will also be able to exchange remittances in the near future. As for the general mail packages between our country and various places abroad, they are still being exchanged. Among them, mail to the Soviet Union and Eastern European new democracies is transported via the Siberian Railway, and most of the rest is forwarded via Hong Kong, and occasionally directly transported by foreign ships. In order to speed up postal transportation and facilitate communication between overseas Chinese, post offices in various places have recently resumed accepting international airmail for forwarding via Hong Kong. International parcels can currently only be sent to the Soviet Union. The Shanghai Bureau has already started accepting them, and the Tianjin Bureau is preparing to start accepting them. The Soviet Union has also sealed and sent general parcel packages to Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin and other places in our country. Foreign exchange remittances have not yet been restored temporarily.

The main reason why the national postal service has rapidly achieved a comprehensive recovery is first of all the great victory of the People's Liberation Army, and secondly the adequate preparations made by the leading organs in various regions for the postal takeover work. The takeover cadres in various places carefully studied the takeover policies, and tried their best not to disrupt the original institutions during the takeover, and paid attention to uniting the newly liberated postal workers and staff to serve the people's postal service together. Although there were some deviations in the implementation of policies in individual regions, they have been quickly corrected.

Under the existing financial, economic, and transportation conditions, postal work still has some difficulties and problems. The most important of these is the mail transportation problem. Because railway transportation is currently busy, the amount of transport that can be allocated to the post office is often insufficient, resulting in frequent backlogs of mailbags. In the Northwest and Southwest, the post office's self-operated motor vehicle postal routes from Lanzhou to Dihua, Xining, Ningxia, and Xi'an, and from Baoji via Chengdu, Chongqing, Guiyang to Dushan, are also due to insufficient vehicles and outdated parts, as well as the high cost of tires, parts, and fuel, so the schedule is sparse and delivery is inevitably slow. Secondly, in terms of rural postal services, in the past, places such as North China were funded by the local government, but now that the national postal service is unified, the rural postal expenses should naturally be borne by the post office. Although rural postal income is small and expenses are large, resulting in a lot of losses, the postal service will still try its best to maintain it for the needs of the vast number of farmers. In addition, in terms of international mail transportation, it is also necessary to strengthen contact with various transportation agencies in order to improve delivery speed.

Based on the national financial and economic situation, the General Post Office has decided that the general policy of postal work this year is to focus on consolidation and recovery, and requires efforts to develop business on the existing basis, and strive to achieve and exceed the 1950 work plan determined by the postal conference. In terms of finance, strive to save expenses and ensure that no additional treasury subsidies are added; in terms of organization, business, personnel, finance, and supply systems, strive to achieve national unity; in terms of the promotion of the entire work, it is required to actively cooperate with the realization of the new democratic political and economic construction tasks on the principle of serving the people, in order to gradually achieve the goals of business management and democratic management.

### 全国邮政概况

　　全国邮政概况
    【新华社北京十五日电】自从全国性的邮政总局，今年元旦在首都成立以来，全国人民邮政事业即开始走上了统一管理和全面恢复的道路。全国各地区的邮政，原来是由东北、华北、西北、华东、华中各大行政区的邮政或邮电管理总局分别领导的。邮政总局成立后，西北、华东、华中各邮政管理总局分别改为邮政总分局，其任务为督导、检查辖区邮政工作和执行总局所赋予的各项任务。华北邮政总局取消，其所辖各省邮政管理局直接归邮政总局领导。东北邮电管理总局改为邮政和电信总分局，以利专业发展。西南新解放区另行成立西南邮政总分局。全国现有由邮政总局统一领导的邮区为华北的北京、天津、山西、平原四区；东北的沈阳、长春、哈尔滨、齐齐哈尔、锦州等五区；西北的陕西、陕北、甘宁青、新疆等四区；华东的上海、江苏、山东、安徽、浙江、福建等六区；中南的河南、湖北、湖南、江西、广东、广西等六区；西南的贵州、云南、西川、东川等四区。以上共二十九个邮区。此外，还有一个内蒙邮区暂时由当地政府领导；台湾邮区则尚待解放。
    由于各地交通的迅速恢复，全国大小城市以至乡村均可互通信件。大多数大中小城市还可互通包裹。全国各地可以互通汇兑的邮局，截至一月十九日止，计东北区有一百五十二处，华北区有四百五十一处，华东区有八百零九处，中南区有四百五十四处，西北区有一百三十五处，共计二千零一处。新解放的广东、广西、贵州、云南、西川、东川、新疆等邮区，最近期内亦可通汇。至于我国与国外各地的邮件总包，现仍继续互换。其中寄苏联及东欧各新民主主义国家的邮件，系经由西比利亚铁路运递，其余大都取道香港转寄，间亦利用外轮径行运递。为了加速邮运，便利侨胞通讯起见，各地邮局复于最近恢复收寄国际航空邮件，发寄香港转递。国际包裹现仅可寄苏联，上海局已收寄，天津局则准备开始收寄。苏联亦已向我北京、上海、天津等地封发包裹总包。国外汇兑则暂时还没有恢复。
    全国邮务迅速获得全面恢复的主要原因，首先是由于人民解放军的伟大胜利，其次则由于各地区的领导机关对于邮政接管工作事先作了充分的准备。各地接管干部曾细心地学习了接管的政策，接管时尽量做到不打乱原来的机构，并注意了团结新解放的邮工和职员，共同为人民邮政事业服务。个别地区在执行政策上虽曾有某些偏差，但亦已迅速得到纠正。
    邮政工作在现有的财政、经济和交通状况下，还多少存在着一些困难和问题。其中最主要的是邮件运输问题。因为目前铁路运输繁忙，能够拨给邮局的运量常不足用，以致邮袋常有积压的现象。在西北和西南方面，邮局自办的由兰州至迪化、西宁、宁夏、西安，由宝鸡经成都、重庆、贵阳至独山的汽车邮路，也因为车辆不足且机件陈旧，兼以所耗轮胎、零件、油料等费用甚巨，所以班期较疏，寄递不免迟缓。其次，在乡邮方面，以前如华北等地是由当地政府供给经费，现在全国邮政统一，乡邮经费自然应由邮局负担。虽然乡邮收入少，支出大，亏损很多，但为了广大农民的需要，邮政方面仍将勉力维持。此外，在国际邮件的运输方面亦须加强与各交通运输机关的联系，以便提高寄递速度。
    邮政总局根据全国财政经济状况，决定今年邮政工作的总方针是以整理和恢复为主，并要求在现有基础上努力发展业务，为实现和超过邮政会议所确定的一九五○年工作计划而奋斗。在财政上努力节省开支，保证不增加国库贴补；在组织、业务、人事、财务、供应各种制度上，努力做到全国的统一；在整个工作的推行方面，则要求在为人民服务的原则上，积极配合实现新民主主义的政治、经济、建设任务，以逐渐达到经营企业化和管理民主化的目标。
