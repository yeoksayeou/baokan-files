Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 3rd. Attempting to Obstruct the Eastern People's Liberation Movement: American Aggressors Arrive One After Another, Scheming and Plotting.
Following in the footsteps of Yasepu, the architect of America's Far East aggression policy, the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff, headed by Bradley, have begun their planned so-called Far East inspection tour.

According to United Press International and Associated Press Tokyo reports: After arriving in Tokyo on the night of January 31, U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Bradley, Army Chief of Staff Collins, Navy Chief of Staff Sherman, and Air Force Chief of Staff Vandenberg immediately claimed that the issues of China and Taiwan would be two major issues discussed by the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff and MacArthur. On the 1st, MacArthur's headquarters held secret military meetings all day long. In addition to the four chiefs of staff and MacArthur, the highest-ranking generals of MacArthur's headquarters and Vice Admiral Burke, commander of the U.S. Seventh Fleet in the Far East, also participated. According to the Kuomintang Central News Agency, senior generals of MacArthur's headquarters presented a secret plan outline drafted according to a report submitted by MacArthur to the U.S. Department of the Army a year ago. One part of it specifically emphasized the need to increase American naval, land, and air power in the Far East in order to deal with the liberation movements of the peoples of various countries in the region. The meeting also discussed the issue of intervention in Vietnam.

Another important conspiracy of this trip by the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff is to attempt to turn Japan into a permanent American military base and springboard for aggression. According to officers at MacArthur's headquarters, the United States intends to build Yokosuka, a Japanese naval base, into the primary U.S. naval base in the Far East. The United States also intends to permanently maintain air force bases in Japan that can accommodate aircraft carrying atomic bombs.

Bradley and others are scheduled to inspect Yokosuka and Kyoto, where the U.S. military headquarters are located, on the 2nd and 3rd. Afterward, they will inspect the U.S. Army, Navy, and Marine Corps stationed in Japan, inspect military facilities in Sasebo and other places in southwestern Japan, and inspect U.S. military bases in Okinawa, the Philippines, Guam, and Hawaii.

　　妄图阻挠东方人民解放运动
    美侵略分子接踵而至
    正蠢蠢进行阴谋活动
    【新华社北京三日电】最近，美帝国主义分子接踵而至远东，进行侵略活动。跟随美国远东侵略政策制订人耶塞普的足迹之后，以布莱德雷为首的美国联合参谋长又开始了预定的所谓远东巡视。
    据合众社、美联社东京消息：美国联合参谋部主席布莱德雷、陆军参谋长柯林斯、海军参谋长薛尔曼、空军参谋长范登堡，于一月三十一日夜抵达东京后，即声称中国和台湾问题将为美国联合参谋长与麦克阿瑟讨论中的两个主要问题。一日，麦克阿瑟总部即整日举行秘密军事会议，参加者除四参谋长及麦克阿瑟外，尚有麦克阿瑟总部的最高级将领及美驻远东第七特种舰队司令柏克中将。据国民党中央社透露，麦克阿瑟总部的高级将领，曾在会上提出一个按照麦克阿瑟一年前向美国陆军部所提报告草拟的秘密计划大纲，其中一部分特别强调要求增加美国在远东的海陆空军实力，以便对付这一地区各国人民的解放运动。会议中并讨论了对越南进行干涉的问题。
    美国联合参谋长此行的另一重要阴谋，是企图将日本变为美国的永久军事基地和侵略跳板。据麦克阿瑟总部的军官声称，美国企图将日本的海军基地横须贺建成美国在远东的首要海军基地。美国并企图在日本长久保有可以停落携有原子弹的飞机的空军基地。
    布莱德雷等定于二、三两日视察横须贺及驻有美军总部的京都等地。往后将检阅驻在日本的美国陆海军和海军陆战队，视察日本西南部佐世保等地的军事设备，并视察冲绳岛、菲律宾、关岛及夏威夷等地的美国军事基地。
