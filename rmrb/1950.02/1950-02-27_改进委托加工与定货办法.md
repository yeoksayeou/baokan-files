　　To accelerate the current recovery and future development of economic construction, it is absolutely necessary for state-owned enterprises to order from and commission processing to private factories. This is the correct path to unleash the positive role of private capital in industrial production and gradually guide private capitalism towards state capitalism, and should be promoted.

　　However, it must be noted that this is a question of how the state economy leads the private capitalist economy, and this leadership must be realized according to the path of New Democracy, not the path of capitalism. That is to say, our processing and ordering are for the current and future needs of economic construction, not simply for doing business.

　　Therefore, first of all, in the way of commissioning processing and ordering, we cannot simply rely on bidding, that is, we cannot simply decide who to order from based on who is cheaper. We should promote detailed investigation and research, and allocate orders in a planned way. We need to understand the production capacity, technical equipment, operating conditions, and the morale of employees in each factory in each industry, as the basis for allocating orders. This investigation and allocation work should be carried out jointly by state-owned enterprises and government enterprise departments.

　　Secondly, commissioned processing and ordering must maintain a reasonable profit margin. But this requires accurate cost accounting. In the past, some state-owned enterprises, due to the lack of cost accounting, set profit margins too high or too low, causing many problems. The Tianjin Railway Bureau's ordering from private factories, even without specifying the raw materials to be used, was even more problematic.

　　Thirdly, we must supervise and inspect commissioned processing and ordering very carefully to ensure that the finished products meet specifications and are completed on time, so as not to adversely affect national construction work. The problems that occurred last year in the commissioned processing and ordering by various state-owned enterprises in Beijing from private factories should arouse our vigilance.

　　But, on the other hand, the dispatch of technical personnel by the Water Conservancy Promotion Society to the factories undertaking commissioned processing and ordering to supervise production and closely monitor product inspection is a successful experience worthy of learning.

　　In short, we must clarify this basic concept: in a New Democratic country, private capitalism must be conducive to the national economy and the people's livelihood only under the correct leadership of the state-owned economy. Allowing private capitalism to run rampant, or even blindly following the capitalist path, would be a mistake.

### 改进委托加工与定货办法

　　改进委托加工与定货办法
    为着加速目前经济建设事业的恢复和将来的发展，公营企业向私营工厂定货及委托加工是完全必要的。这是发挥私人资本在工业生产上的积极性，并逐步引导私人资本主义走向国家资本主义的正确道路，应当予以提倡。
    但是，必须注意，这是国家经济如何领导私人资本主义经济的问题，而且，必须按照新民主主义的轨道，而不能按照资本主义的轨道去实现这个领导。就是说，我们这样的加工与定货，是为经济建设现在和将来的需要，而不是单纯地作生意。
    因此，首先在委托加工与定货的方式上，不能单纯地依靠招标，即不能单纯地看谁便宜便向谁定货。我们应该提倡细密的调查研究，有计划地分配承制品。要了解各个行业中各个工厂的生产能力、技术设备、经营情况以及厂内员工的情绪，作为分配定货的根据。这种调查、分配的工作，应该由公营企业与政府企业部门结合进行。
    其次，委托加工和定货，都要保持合理的利润率。但这需要有精确的成本计算。过去有的公营企业，由于缺乏成本计算，以致把利润规定过高或过低，引起很多弊病。天津铁路局向私营工厂定货，甚至对所采用的原料也不加以规定，弊病更大。
    第三，对委托加工与定货又必须十分认真监督与检查，保证成品合乎规格，按期完成，以免使国家建设工作遭受不利的影响。去年北京各公营企业向私营工厂委托加工与定货中所发生的弊病，应该引起我们的警惕。
    但，另外一方面，水利推进社派遣技术人员分赴受委托加工与定货的各工厂监督生产，抓紧对产品的检查，则是成功的经验，值得学习。
    总之，我们必须明确这样一个基本观念：在新民主主义国家中，私人资本主义必须在国营经济正确领导下，才能有利于国计民生。对私人资本主义放任自流，甚至盲目地按照资本主义轨道走，都是会犯错误的。
