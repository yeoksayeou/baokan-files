Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, February 27th: TASS, Moscow Dispatch: In reviewing world events on February 26th in *Pravda*, Mayevsky commented on the reaction of world opinion to the signing of the treaty and agreements between the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China.

    Mayevsky wrote: In the cities and villages of the People's Republic of China, grand gatherings and demonstrations were held to celebrate the signing of the treaty. The working people of China unanimously approve of the treaty and agreements, and express deep gratitude to the Soviet people and the fraternal assistance and eternal friendship of the great Stalin.

    Hundreds of millions of people around the world warmly welcome this treaty, considering it another demonstration of the wisdom of the Soviet Union's Stalinist foreign policy. In this treaty, they see the beginning of a new era of inseparable friendship and alliance between the two peoples. All freedom-loving people of all countries praise the Sino-Soviet Treaty as a great contribution to the cause of peace and security in the Far East and the world, and as an important factor in increasing the strength of the camp of peace, democracy, and socialism.

    The democratic press pointed out: Every article and every sentence of the Sino-Soviet Treaty expresses concern for the consolidation of peace and universal security, and insists on efforts to prevent the resurgence of Japanese aggression and any other country that directly or indirectly colludes with Japan in aggressive acts and undermines peace. The Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China have set for themselves the task of striving for the early conclusion of a peace treaty with Japan with the Allied nations of the Second World War.

    The documents signed on February 14th give a crushing blow to the criminal conspiracies of the war-makers and the absurd propaganda of the bankrupt Washington politicians and their Marshallized servants, and expose Acheson's ranting about insisting that the Soviet Union is separating and annexing the northern regions of China.

    No wonder Acheson dared not repeat his fabrications at a press conference held after the signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty. His speech clearly had a tone of panic, and it seemed ridiculous that he insisted that it was the Soviet Union, not the United States, that was delaying the conclusion of a peace treaty with Japan. This slander against the Soviet Union proves one fact: that Acheson extremely disliked the clause in the Sino-Soviet Treaty regarding both parties expressing the hope to strive for the quickest resolution of the Japanese issue.

    The reactionary press tried its best to diminish the importance of the Sino-Soviet Treaty and agreements. But they also failed in this regard. Many bourgeois newspapers had to admit: for example, the *New York World-Telegram* said that the signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty may be the most important event in international politics after the end of the war; and the *Washington Post* said that the signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty is a major diplomatic victory for the Soviet Union and China.

    The signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty is an event of world significance. The existence of this treaty will help further develop the victorious struggle of freedom-loving people for peace and security, and against the aggressive attempts of the imperialist warmongers.

　　世界千万人民欢迎中苏条约  再次表明斯大林外交的明智
    真理报发表马耶夫斯基评论
    【新华社北京二十七日电】塔斯社莫斯科讯：马耶夫斯基于二十六日在真理报上检讨世界大事时，评论世界舆论对苏联与中华人民共和国签订条约和协定的反应。
    马耶夫斯基写道：中华人民共和国的各城市和乡村中，举行了盛会与示威游行，庆祝条约的签订。中国劳动人民一致赞同条约和协定，并对苏联人民和伟大的斯大林的兄弟般的援助和永恒的友谊，表示深切的感激。
    全世界千千万万的人民，都热烈地欢迎这个条约，认为它再次表明了苏联的斯大林外交政策的明智。他们在这个条约中看到两国人民间不可分离的友谊与同盟的新时代的开始。所有国家的爱好自由的人民，都称赞中苏条约是对远东及全世界和平与安全事业的伟大贡献，并且是增加了和平、民主及社会主义阵营实力的重要因素。
    民主报界指出：中苏条约的每一条与每一句，都表示关怀和平及普遍安全的巩固，并坚持努力阻止日本及在侵略行为上直接或间接与日本勾结的其他任何国家之重新侵略与破坏和平。苏联和中华人民共和国为它们自己规定了争取与第二次世界大战中诸同盟国家早日缔结对日和约的任务。
    二月十四日签订的各项文件，对战争制造者们的犯罪阴谋以及破产了的华盛顿政客们和他们的马歇尔化的奴仆们的荒谬宣传，给予一个粉碎性的打击，并揭露了艾奇逊关于硬说苏联正分离中国北部地区并予以兼并的狂呓声明。
    无怪乎艾奇逊在中苏条约签订后所举行的一次记者招待会上不敢重复他的杜撰了。他的演说显然有惊慌失措的语调，他硬说拖延缔结对日和约的是苏联而不是美国，这显得很滑稽。这种对苏联的诽谤，证明了一项事实，即中苏条约中关于双方表示希望争取最快地解决日本问题的条款，是艾奇逊极为不喜欢的。
    反动的报界极力缩小中苏条约与协定的重要性。但它们在这方面也失败了。许多资产阶级报纸不得不承认：例如纽约世界电讯--太阳报说，中苏条约的签订，或为战争结束后国际政治中的最为重要的事件；又如华盛顿邮报说，中苏条约的签订，是苏联和中国的重大外交胜利。
    中苏条约的签订，是一项具有世界重要性的事件。这个条约的存在，将有助于进一步发展爱好自由的人民为争取和平与安全、反对帝国主义战争制造者们的侵略企图所进行的胜利的斗争。
