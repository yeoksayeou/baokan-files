Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 3rd: According to a TASS dispatch from Shanghai on the 1st: According to Tokyo sources: Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Yoshida delivered a policy speech in the House of Representatives on January 23rd. Yoshida insisted that Japan is currently facing a so-called "upsurge," which he claims is due to the so-called "economic stabilization" plan of the United States. In fact, the result of this "stabilization" is that American monopoly enterprises have occupied more than 80 percent of the Japanese economy, that there are as many as 13 million unemployed people and an increase in the tax burden, that small and medium-sized enterprises are being stifled, that workers' wages are at a poverty level, and that the basic democratic rights of the working people are being deprived. All of this is the result of the American "stabilization" plan.

Yoshida said that it "will be impossible" to increase the wages of state-owned enterprise employees. He shamelessly said that the people must "grit their teeth and endure." Yoshida openly declared that his government does not intend to meet the urgent demands of the broad masses of the Japanese people. At the same time, he also said that the pitifully weak controls on monopoly enterprises should also be lifted. This once again shows that the Japanese government is a loyal lackey of American and Japanese monopoly enterprises.

The diplomatic part of Yoshida's speech was of a revanchist nature and full of anti-Soviet clamoring. Yoshida said: "Japan's abandonment of war does not mean giving up the right to self-defense." This arrogant militarist, revanchist, and agent of American imperialism's demand for the so-called "right of self-defense" is nothing more than a manifestation of the American attempt to turn Japan into a military springboard and push Japan into the abyss of new national disasters.

Yoshida's shameless speech in parliament encouraged Japanese revanchists. Cabinet Secretary General Koshichi Masuda came forward with a provocative statement calling for a separate peace treaty with the United States. The unscrupulous militarists, who are being generously sponsored by the American occupation authorities, attacked the Allied joint resolutions.

Nosaka Sanzō, member of the Central Political Bureau of the Japanese Communist Party and member of the House of Representatives, refuted Yoshida's revanchist speech in the House of Representatives. Nosaka strongly condemned the anti-people policies of the Japanese government, saying that Japan will not gain full independence as long as Yoshida is in power. Yoshida hopes to conclude a separate peace treaty in order to legitimize and perpetuate this situation. Nosaka declared that the Communist Party demands the precise implementation of the Potsdam Declaration, the full independence of Japan, the rapid withdrawal of occupying forces after the conclusion of a peace treaty, and free trade. The Communist Party opposes the establishment of military bases in Japan.

Other opposition leaders also criticized Yoshida's speech in the House of Representatives.

### 吉田在众院叫嚣反苏  野坂痛斥反人民政策  竭力反对在日建立军事基地

　　吉田在众院叫嚣反苏
    野坂痛斥反人民政策
    竭力反对在日建立军事基地
    【新华社北京三日电】据塔斯社上海一日讯：据东京消息：日本首相吉田茂于一月二十三日在众议院中发表了施政方针的演说。吉田硬说，日本目前面临一种所谓“高涨”，这是由于美国的所谓“经济稳定”计划所促成的。事实上，这种“稳定”的结果，是美国大垄断企业已霸占了日本经济的百分之八十以上，是数达一千三百万人的大量失业以及赋税负担的增加，是中小企业的窒息、工人工资的赤贫水准和劳动人民基本民主权利的被剥夺。这一切就是美国“稳定”计划的成果。
    吉田说：国家企业的职工增加工资，“将是不可能的”。他无耻地说：人民必须“咬紧牙关来撑持”。吉田公开地宣告：他的政府不打算满足日本广大群众的迫切要求。他同时又说，对垄断企业弱得可怜的管制，也要取消。这样，就再次表明了：日本政府是美国和日本垄断企业的忠实走狗。
    吉田的演说中关于外交的部分，具有报复主义的性质，并充满着反苏的叫嚣。吉田说：“日本废弃战争并不意味着放弃自卫的权利。”这个狂妄的军国主义者、报复主义者、美国帝国主义者的代理人提出所谓“自卫权”的要求，只不过是美国企图把日本变为军事跳板，并把日本推到新的民族灾难深渊的侵略计划的表现而已。
    吉田在议会发表的无耻演说，怂恿了日本报复主义者。内阁书记长增田甲子七出面发表了一篇挑拨性的声明，要求与美国缔结单独的和约。受到美国占领当局仁慈地赞助的肆无忌惮的军国主义者，攻击了同盟国的联合决议。
    日本共产党中央政治局委员，众院议员野坂参三在众院中驳斥了吉田的报复主义演说。野坂强烈地谴责日本政府的反人民政策，并称：吉田在位一天，日本就一天得不到充分独立。吉田希望缔结单独的和约，以便使这种情况合法化并使其延续下去。野坂宣称：共产党要求确切地履行波茨坦宣言、日本的充分独立、和约缔结后迅速撤退占领军以及自由贸易。共产党反对在日本建立军事基地。
    其他反对党的领袖们亦在众院中批评了吉田的演说。
