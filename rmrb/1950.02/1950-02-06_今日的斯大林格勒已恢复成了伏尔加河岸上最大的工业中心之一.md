　　Xinhua News Agency, Stalingrad, February 5th: In the seven years since the victory of the Battle of Stalingrad, the working people of this heroic city have used heroic work to restore it as one of the largest industrial centers on the banks of the Volga River. The people of Stalingrad have victoriously put into practice the guarantees they made in the socialist competition. Last year, local industry commemorated Stalin's 70th birthday by reaching the average monthly quota for 1950 and constructing 90,000 square meters of living space. Hundreds of workers and staff have moved into new and beautiful homes. This year, construction work will be greatly expanded. At the initiative of the working people, a 30-kilometer-long avenue named after Stalin will be built, with many beautiful houses built on both sides.
