The End of Traitorous Despots
	Liu Quanli, a Traitorous Despot in the 15th District of Beijing, Sentenced to Death; Liu Keyan and Others, Despots in the 19th District, Sentenced to Imprisonment
[Beijing News] Liu Quanli (also known as Liu Quanli), a traitorous despot in Yangfang Village, 15th District of Beijing, colluded with Japanese invaders and Kuomintang reactionary troops in the past, successively capturing and killing six of our revolutionary cadres and villagers, and personally presiding over the live burial of one of our revolutionary cadres. He has been sentenced to death by the Municipal People's Court. His son, Liu Qingtai, a "Central Statistics Bureau" (Zhongtong) secret agent and puppet Bao chief, and Yin Hengliang, a "Central Statistics Bureau" secret agent and puppet Jia chief, colluded with Liu Quanli to commit evil deeds. Liu Qingtai was sentenced to twelve years of imprisonment, and Yin Hengliang was sentenced to ten years of imprisonment. Liu Quanli, a traitorous despot, was a landlord in Yangfang Village. Before the liberation of Beijing, he served for a long time as the deputy director of the puppet 12th Joint Guarantee of the South Suburb of Beijing and the head of the puppet Loving the Village in Xihongmen Village. On February 6, 1939, Liu Quanli colluded with the Sato unit of the Japanese invaders to capture and kill villagers Yin Hengzu, Yin Si'ga, Fan Yinzhong, and others. In 1946, our army once liberated Yangfang Village and implemented the policy of rent and interest reduction in the village. On April 18 of the same year, Liu colluded with the bandit army of the puppet Wanping County to go to the village and personally led the way to capture our village cadres and their families. That night, he buried Zhang Shutian, the director of the Anti-Japanese Association in the village, Wang Dianchen, a member of the Poor Peasants' Association, and Yin Xi, a member of the cadre's family, alive in Langfang Village. In October of the same year, Liu intercepted one of our working cadres, personally presided over the severe torture, and accepted Yin Hengliang's suggestion to bury the working cadre alive at Wangjia Shapo in the southwest of the village at 12 o'clock that night. In addition to participating in his father's above-mentioned crimes, his son Liu Qingtai was entrusted by his relative Tian during the Japanese occupation to bribe Japanese military police to kill a resident. In June 1948, he forced the poor peasants of the village to build houses for Liu Quanli free of charge, with as many as 240 workdays in one month. In addition to his exploitation and occupation of the residents' property in the village, the current village chief Wang Wenbin and others have calculated that the total amount is equivalent to 12,720 catties of wheat and 16,960 catties of corn. Yin Hengliang, a "Central Statistics Bureau" secret agent and puppet Jia chief, specialized in aiding and abetting evil. He participated in the planning of all the above-mentioned crimes committed by the Liu family. After the liberation of Beijing, the residents of the village reported the crimes of Liu and others. The Fifteenth District Government of the city and the Fengtai Public Security Bureau escorted Liu and others to the Beijing Municipal People's Court. After verifying the above-mentioned crimes, the court sentenced Liu Quanli to death for his heinous crimes in order to uphold the national law. Liu Qingtai confessed and repented during his training in the Qinghe Brigade and during the court's trial, and was specially reduced to twelve years of imprisonment. Yin Hengliang colluded with Liu to commit evil deeds and was sentenced to ten years of imprisonment. The 12,720 catties of wheat and 16,960 catties of corn extorted from the residents will be confiscated from Liu Qingtai and returned to the victimized villagers.
[Beijing News] Liu Keyan, a despot in the 19th District of the Western Suburbs, and his son Liu Zhuwu, committed many evil deeds by relying on the power of the enemy and puppets in the past. After the liberation, they were sued by local farmers and sent to the Beijing Municipal People's Court for trial. They have now been sentenced. Liu Keyan was sentenced to fifteen years of imprisonment, and Liu Zhuwu was sentenced to eight years of imprisonment.
Liu Keyan served as the puppet village chief of Gong Village in the 19th District in 1936. After the outbreak of the Anti-Japanese War, he became a puppet Bao chief, the head of the 10th Self-Defense Regiment of Wanping County, and the head of the puppet Xihuang Village Township and Loving the Village. For more than ten years, he has consistently relied on the power of the enemy, puppets, and Kuomintang reactionaries to run rampant and force people to death many times. In September 1940, Liu Keyan falsely accused Zhao Liu, Xie Tinglin, Wang Fu, and others, farmers in Tian Village, of theft because of greed and bribery, causing the three to die unjustly in prison. In April 1941, he forcibly bought the leased land of tenant farmer Du Dakuan, causing Du Dakuan to die of depression. In October 1942, Liu used tricks to deceive Zhang Yongxing of Gong Village into buying his house, causing Zhang Yongxing's family to be ruined. In 1947, Liu Keyan and his son, in order to curry favor with the Kuomintang reactionary government, led the self-defense team to conscript soldiers, taking away as many as seventeen young people from the township. During the conscription, they forced Li Dianqing's daughter-in-law to death and extorted more than 2,000 catties of grain from Zhang Jun, making it impossible for Zhang Jun's family to live. In addition, Liu Keyan and his son embezzled and swallowed fertilizer, seeds, and funds lent to farmers, increased township office expenses, embezzled grain funds, forced the people to build air-raid shelters for the Japanese invaders, and deducted all wages. The masses hated Liu Keyan and his son for their various crimes.
