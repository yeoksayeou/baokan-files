　　Youth League Central Committee and All-China Democratic Youth Federation
    Issue Letter to Asian Youth
　　Paying Tribute to Comrades Fighting Heroically for National Liberation
    Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 20th – The Central Committee of the China New Democratic Youth League and the All-China Democratic Youth Federation have issued a letter to Asian youth on the "Day of Struggle Against the Colonial System" on February 21st. The full text is as follows:

    Oppressed brothers of Asia:

    On the occasion of the "Day of Struggle Against the Colonial System," the hearts of us Chinese youth turn to you, to all brothers in Asia who are fighting against colonial slavery and for national liberation. We think of how the various ethnic groups of Asia have created a long history and culture with labor and wisdom, how they have suffered unimaginable pain and torment under imperialist oppression, and how they long to break free from the slave shackles that have suffocated us for so long. For centuries, the history of the Asian people has been a history of resistance against imperialist aggression. We are proud that the Asian people not only hate pain and darkness, but are also able to stand up heroically to fight against the oppressors, using our own strength to create a better future for us.

    We express our greatest respect to those young partners who have taken up arms and joined the ranks of the national liberation struggle. In Vietnam, Burma, South Korea, Malaya, the Philippines, and Indonesia, you are using all weapons to resist enemies equipped with modern arms. Although your struggle is arduous, it is the right path to liberation.

    We have not forgotten those comrades who are persecuted under the reign of terror. In India, you are arrested and shot while assembling and marching; in Iran and Iraq, you are forced to go underground; in other Asian countries, you are thrown into prison and even face the threat of death. But in order to win the liberation of your nation, you are still stubbornly persevering in the battle under severe persecution.

    We are concerned about the struggle of Japanese democratic youth against turning Japan into a base for American aggressive war, and for all efforts to establish a democratic Japan and eliminate fascist remnants.

专栏：反对殖民制度斗争日

　　青年团中央及民主青联总会
    发表告亚洲青年书
　　向为民族解放而英勇斗争的战友们致敬
    【新华社北京二十日电】中国新民主主义青年团中央委员会、中华全国民主青年联合总会顷发表二月二十一日反对殖民制度斗争日告亚洲青年书，全文如下：亚洲被压迫的弟兄们：
    值此“反对殖民制度斗争日”来临时，我们中国青年的心转向你们，转向亚洲一切反对殖民地奴役争取民族解放的弟兄。我们想到我们亚洲各民族怎样以劳动与智慧创造了悠久的历史与文化，怎样在帝国主义压迫下受尽了难以想像的痛苦熬煎，又怎样渴望挣脱那长时期窒息我们的奴隶枷锁。几世纪以来，亚洲人民的历史是一部反抗帝国主义侵略的历史。我们引以自豪的，是亚洲人民不仅仇视痛苦与黑暗，而且能够英勇地站起来向着压迫者作斗争，以自己的力量来创造我们更美好的将来。
    我们对那些拿起武器参加到民族解放斗争的行列里的年青伙伴，表示最大的敬意。你们在越南、缅甸、南朝鲜、马来亚、菲律宾和印度尼西亚，用一切武器去抵抗现代装备的敌人。虽然你们的斗争是艰苦的，但这是走向解放的正确道路。
    我们没有忘记那些在恐怖统治下遭受迫害的战友。在印度，你们在集会游行时被逮捕枪杀，在伊朗、伊拉克，你们被迫转入地下活动，在亚洲的其他国家，你们被投入监狱中，甚至面对死亡的威胁。但是为了争取你们民族的解放，你们在严重的迫害下面仍然顽强地坚持着战斗。
    我们关心日本民主青年反对把日本变为美国侵略战争基地的斗争，以及对于建立一个民主的日本与肃清法西斯残余的一切努力。
