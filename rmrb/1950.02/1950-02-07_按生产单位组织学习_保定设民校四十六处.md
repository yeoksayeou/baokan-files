　　Organize Learning According to Production Units
　　Baoding Establishes Forty-Six People's Schools
　　[Our Newspaper's Report] Baoding City, Hebei Province, has achieved considerable success in establishing people's schools over the past year. The city's people's schools began to be established at the beginning of last year. As of the end of December, the city had 46 people's schools, 12 learning groups, and 2,694 students. The composition of the students was 52% workers (excluding state-owned factory workers), 24% farmers from the suburbs, and about 23% general citizens. This basically implemented the policy of facing workers, peasants, and the general working people. After a year of study, the political and cultural levels of the students have improved. Generally, students have a clearer understanding of issues such as "the Four Friends," "the Three Enemies," the policy of benefiting both labor and capital, and urban-rural relations. The Xianxue Street school tested ten students on the above issues, and the average score was 76.7 points. Zhai Baolin, an apprentice at Hengfeng Sauce Garden, after listening to a lecture on "Urban-Rural Mutual Aid" at the people's school, refused to lend his neighbor a large scale to deceive villagers who came to buy yellow grass. In terms of culture: The advanced class of Xianxue Street People's School, which was originally at the junior primary level, has now learned simple fractions and general integer arithmetic, and Chinese has learned sentence construction, sentence filling, and answering nouns, reaching the senior primary level. In the literacy class of twenty-one people, all of whom were originally illiterate, the most literate now know 800 characters, and the least literate know 150 characters, and have learned the national phonetic alphabet and arithmetic addition and subtraction.
　　The reason why Baoding's people's schools have been able to persist year after year from scratch is mainly because they have paid attention to combining production and learning. The organizational form of the people's schools does not adopt a rigid unified method, but flexibly organizes literacy classes, study groups, noon schools, every-other-day classes, weekly schools, etc. for learning, according to different production units, different production times, and the number of people. For example, for porter workers, people's schools are organized in the porter businesses. They work collectively and study collectively after work. Shop assistants, if a family has four or five people, one or two can go to the people's school to study; if there are only one or two, they may not come. Shop assistants at home organize study groups according to different industries (such as weaving, bathing, etc.), which are uniformly led by the people's school committee and given learning materials to study. The 43rd Street People's School, combined with the students' production such as picking flowers, ginning cotton, and sewing pockets, formed various study groups. Because learning does not interfere with production, the people's schools have generally received the support of parents and managers. On the basis of closely combining production, when the masses have a way to live, they have the need to learn. Therefore, some people have automatically organized people's schools. For example, the workers of the Second Branch of Carpenters, hired a teacher themselves, bought books themselves, and studied very well. This situation proves that as long as it is combined with production and based on the masses' conscious voluntariness, the people's schools can not only be consolidated, but also develop in the direction of "people-run and government-assisted."

### 按生产单位组织学习  保定设民校四十六处

　　按生产单位组织学习
    保定设民校四十六处
    【本报讯】河北保定市创办民众学校，一年来获相当成绩。该市民校去年年初开始创办，截至十二月底，全市已有民校四十六处，学习小组十二个，学员二千六百九十四人。学员成份工人占百分之五十二（国营工厂工人除外），市郊农民占百分之二十四，一般市民占百分之二十三左右。基本上贯彻了面向工农及一般劳动人民的方针。经过一年来的学习，学员的政治、文化水平均有提高。一般学员对“四个朋友”、“三个敌人”、劳资两利政策、城乡关系等问题都有了较清楚的了解。县学街对十个学员测验了以上问题，平均分数是七十六、七分。恒丰酱园的学徒翟保林在民校听讲过“城乡互助”之后，邻居来借大秤买黄草欺诈乡下人，他不借给。在文化方面：如县学街民校的高级班，原属初小程度，现在算术已学会简单分数和一般整数四则，国文已学会造句、填句、解答名词，达到了高小程度。识字班二十一人，原来都是文盲，现在识字最多的已识了八百字，最少的一百五十字，并学会了国音字母和算术的加减法。
    保市民校从无到有，所以能够常年坚持下来，主要原因是注意了生产与学习结合。民校的组织形式，不采取硬性统一的办法，根据不同的生产单位、不同的生产时间及人数的多少，灵活地组织识字班、学习小组、午校、隔日班、周校等进行学习。如对脚行工人，就在脚行组织民校。他们集体劳动，工作完了就集体学习。店员则一家有四、五人的，一、二人到民校学习，只有一、二人的，可以不来。在家的店员，按照不同行业（如织布业、浴业等）组织学习小组，由民校委员统一领导，发给学习教材进行学习。四十三街民校，更结合学员的拣花、轧花、缝口袋等生产，组成各种学习小组。因为学习不误生产，民校普遍得到了家长和经理的赞助。在密切结合生产的基础上，群众生活有了办法，就有了学习的要求，因此，有的群众已自动起来组织民校。如木工二分会的工人们，自己凭房子请先生，自己买书学习，学得很好。这样的情况，证明了只要结合生产，基于群众的自觉自愿，民校不但可以巩固，而且可以向“民办公助”的方向发展。
