Strengthening the Training of Medical Cadres

　　Peking University Medical College Placed Under the Leadership of the Ministry of Health
    [This newspaper dispatch] The State Council of the Central People's Government recently approved the transfer of Peking University Medical College from the leadership of the Ministry of Education to the Ministry of Health. The handover ceremony was held at 3:00 PM on the 13th. Those attending the ceremony included Minister of Health Li Dequan, Vice Minister He Cheng, Director of the Higher Education Department of the Ministry of Education Zhang Zonglin, all faculty and students of Peking University Medical College, and representatives of medical workers from various units, totaling more than 500 people. At the meeting, Zhang Zonglin, Director of the Higher Education Department of the Ministry of Education, first explained that the significance of transferring Peking University Medical College to the Ministry of Health was to unify learning and application, facilitate the leadership of medical technology, and enable the Medical College to develop better. Tang Yongtong, Chairman of the Peking University School Affairs Committee, reported to all faculty and students in a very excited tone: Today, we announce that Peking University Medical College is under the leadership of the Central Ministry of Health, and I represent all faculty and students in unanimously supporting this measure. Because this will allow us to better combine theory with practice and better serve the people. Minister of Health Li Dequan said at the conference: For many years, under the rule of imperialist feudal forces and the Kuomintang reactionaries, the Chinese people have suffered from backward culture and science, a difficult life, the prevalence of infectious diseases, and a high mortality rate. In the future, medical workers should take on the task of improving the people's health. Vice Minister He Cheng specifically pointed out: China needs 475,000 health workers. Currently, there are only 20,000 in all of China. This number is far from the need. Therefore, the current task is to train a large number of medical cadres. As for teachers and researchers, they are also needed, but they should be improved on the basis of popularization. Therefore, Peking University Medical College should focus on the needs of the whole country in the training task of medical and health workers. Zhong Zhiqi, representative of the Education Workers' Union of Peking University Medical College, Wu Jiefeng, representative of the Workers' Union of Peking University Hospital, and representatives of the Student Union spoke successively, unanimously expressing their support for the government's measures and the instructions of Ministers Li and He, and expressed their willingness to unite all employees and students to complete the tasks given by the government in the future.

　　北京大学医学院划归卫生部领导
    【本报讯】中央人民政府政务院顷批准将北京大学医学院由教育部移交卫生部领导，并于十三日下午三时举行了移交典礼。参加此一典礼的有卫生部李德全部长、贺诚副部长、教育部高教司张宗麟司长、北大医学院全体师生及各单位医务工作者代表共五百余人。会上首先由教育部张宗麟司长说明北大医学院移交卫生部的意义是为了学用一致，便于医务技术的领导，使医学院能更好地发展。北大校务委员会汤用彤主席以极兴奋的口气向全体师生报告说：今天宣布北京大学医学院由中央卫生部领导，我代表全体师生一致拥护这一措施。因为这样可以使我们更好地把理论与实际结合起来，更好地为人民服务。卫生部李德全部长在大会上说：中国人民多年来在帝国主义封建势力及国民党反动派的统治下，文化科学落后，生活困苦，传染病流行，死亡率很高。今后医务工作者应该负起提高人民健康水平的任务。贺诚副部长特别提出说：中国需要四十七万五千个卫生。现在全中国只有二万个。这个数字距离需要差得很远。所以当前的任务是在训练大批医务干部。至于师资和研究人员也是需要的，但应当在普及的基础上提高。因此北京大学医学院在医务卫生工作者的训练任务上应把眼光放在全国需要上面。北大医学院教育工作者工会代表钟之琦、北大医院工作者工会代表吴阶平和学生会代表相继讲话，一致表示拥护政府的措施和李、贺两部长的指示，今后愿意团结所有员工和学生来完成政府给予的任务。
