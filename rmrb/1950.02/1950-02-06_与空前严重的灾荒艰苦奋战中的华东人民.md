The hundreds of millions of liberated people in the East China region are engaged in a difficult struggle against an unprecedentedly severe famine.

For more than a decade, the East China region, which suffered severe damage from the Japanese invaders and the Kuomintang bandits during the War of Resistance Against Japan and the People's Liberation War, encountered another unprecedentedly severe disaster in 1949. First, there was the destruction caused by the Kuomintang bandit army's burning, killing, and looting during its retreat. Incomplete statistics from Suxian, Yongcheng, and Xiaoxian, the battlefields of the Huaihai Campaign where 600,000 Kuomintang bandits were annihilated, show that 1,332 villages were destroyed by the bandits, 73,919 houses were damaged, 2,872 people were killed, 1,895 were injured, and 12,603 head of livestock were lost. A total of 34,156 households, about 200,000 people, directly suffered from the Chiang Kai-shek disaster. In the spring, summer, and autumn of last year, Lu, Su, and Anhui provinces successively suffered from disasters such as floods, droughts, typhoons, hail, insects, and epidemics. The affected area was 53.44 million mu, and the number of victims reached 16.42 million, among which the floods in northern Anhui, northern Jiangsu, and Shandong were the most serious: the affected area in northern Anhui was 17.89 million mu, with 8 million victims (more than 4.4 million severely affected); the affected area in northern Jiangsu was 17.76 million mu, with 4.5 million victims; the affected area in Shandong was 12.48 million mu, with 3.32 million victims.

Although the disaster was so significant and widespread, it did not frighten the people of East China. The heroic people of East China, united under the correct leadership of the East China Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and governments at all levels, devoted themselves to supporting the front lines and waged an indomitable struggle against the successive famines, finally enabling millions of victims to successfully overcome 1949.

Let us review the progress and achievements of production and disaster relief in the East China region over the past year.

First, since the spring of 1949, in order to prevent floods, governments at all levels along the Yangtze River, Huai River, Yellow River, Grand Canal, and the coast of the Yellow Sea mobilized huge forces to rush to repair the embankments destroyed by the Kuomintang bandits. In northern Jiangsu alone, 420,000 laborers were organized to repair more than 2,000 li of the main dikes of the Grand Canal, Hongze Lake, Yangtze River, Huai River, and Fan Gong Dyke, and to dredge more than 190 rivers. In early summer, continuous rain in various places caused the water levels of rivers to rise generally. Mountain torrents broke out in northern Anhui, and embankments everywhere were in imminent danger. The East China Bureau of the CPC Central Committee immediately issued urgent instructions, mobilizing the Party, government, army, and people to focus on flood prevention and rescue, and fully organizing reserve forces to prepare for rescue at any time. Various localities immediately established flood prevention and rescue organizations, with Party members and cadres taking the lead and tens of thousands of residents along the dikes guarding the embankments day and night. Most of the troops stationed in various places also went to the dikes to assist in the rescue. The troops stationed in Ninghu Hangzhou by the Third Field Army alone sent a total of 100,000 people to assist residents in blocking nearly 100 li of dikes and rescuing more than 100,000 mu of flooded farmland. During last year's flood season, 17,000 staff members from the Shandong Provincial People's Government, Shandong Military Region, Shandong Branch of the CPC Central Committee, and Jinan Municipal Committee, together with more than 200,000 local people, troops, and students, formed a living dike, fighting stubbornly against the turbulent Yellow River day and night. After 40 days, they finally defeated the Yellow River with a flow of more than 10,000 cubic meters per second, preventing the dike from breaching (historically, the Yellow River was likely to breach with a flow of 4,000 cubic meters per second). In northern Anhui, 3.5 million people participated in protecting the Yangtze and Huai River dikes. In northern Jiangsu, Gaoyou County alone mobilized and organized 320,000 people, more than 23,000 treadmills and windmills, and 102 water pumps to drain water and flood day and night, rescuing 4-5 million mu of autumn seedlings along the Yangtze River in northern Jiangsu. After intense rescue, all places safely passed the great flood in June. In late July, eastern Jiangsu and the coastal areas of Jiaodong were hit by typhoons. Leading cadres of the Party and government in various places led the people in a tenacious fight against the storm under the slogans of "Man will conquer nature" and "Saving the dike is like saving lives," and countless heroic deeds emerged. When the river water was about to overflow the dike in Tianjiagang, Yangzhou, more than 300 farmers rushed to lie on the dike to block the river water until materials arrived. Farmers in Yaojiaqiao, because materials could not be delivered in time, held each other's arms and knelt on the dike, using their bodies as a dam to resist the flood for an hour until materials arrived and the dike was saved from danger. Some people even sacrificed their lives gloriously in the rescue. Although the sea dikes in Wusong, Gaoqiao, Yangjing, Jiangwan and other districts in the suburbs of Shanghai and Baoshan, Chuansha, Nanhui, Fengxian and other counties had been initially repaired after liberation, they were unexpectedly hit by a severe typhoon in July. Most of the sea dikes were destroyed, with 42 major breaches. In Nanhui County alone, two-thirds of the sea dike base from Xinzha Port to Sanzao Port and from Tangjiaojiao to Huijiao, a total length of 80 li, was washed away, affecting about 400,000 people. At that time, the Songjiang Prefectural Office and the Shanghai Municipal People's Government immediately mobilized 60,000 to 70,000 workers, farmers, students, doctors, Shanghai Garrison troops, and government staff, overcoming difficulties such as tools, materials, and transportation. After a month of hard work, they successively repaired more than 100 li of sea dikes in Nanhui, Chuansha, and Baoshan, allowing the people of Shanghai and surrounding counties, totaling more than 10 million, to safely pass the great flood in August. At that time, many other riverbanks and coastal embankments partially breached because the damage was too severe, and they could not be saved after three or four floods. For example, more than 100 breaches occurred in the riverbanks of Nantong and Taizhou prefectures, and the entire Mahua Dyke between Susong and Wangjiang in northern Anhui collapsed, turning thousands of miles along the river into a vast ocean. Many other places were also hit by floods at the same time. However, governments at all levels continued to lead the people to organize drainage and rescue autumn crops. In northern Jiangsu alone, 7.14 million people were mobilized to rescue 10.98 million mu of autumn crops in a few days, thus obtaining 60% of the autumn harvest. In Chaohu and Luan areas of northern Anhui, a large-scale water draining campaign involving more than 3 million people was launched, and a total of 3 million mu of farmland was rescued in the entire region. As of the end of December, a total of 26.68 million mu of arable land had been rescued in East China.

Immediately after flood prevention and rescue, all localities put forward the slogan of "Planting as much as the water recedes, replanting every mu of land," and organized farmers to replant. Leading cadres at all levels personally went to the countryside to organize the masses to rush to cultivate and plant. In areas lacking seeds, in addition to mobilizing the masses to raise and borrow from each other, the People's Government also lent a large amount of wheat seeds, vegetable seeds, etc. to solve the seed difficulties of the victims. Nearly 30 million catties of grain were lent out in northern Jiangsu, northern Anhui, and southern Jiangsu alone. In addition, all localities helped farmers in disaster areas to appropriately solve difficulties such as farming cattle and farm tools, such as mobilizing non-disaster areas to adjust farming cattle with disaster areas, and disaster-stricken people organizedly hired farming cattle from neighboring areas; in areas with extremely scarce cattle power, manual labor was organized to drag fields and dig land. Therefore, after the water receded in the flooded areas, not only were late autumn grains such as vegetables, beans, sesame, radishes, sorghum, and buckwheat replanted in time, but most areas completed autumn planting one after another from the end of November to the beginning of December. Northern Jiangsu victoriously completed the task of planting nearly 50 million mu of wheat in mid-November. In the Suxian Prefecture of northern Anhui, which was the most severely affected, although it had been flooded three times and part of the masses showed pessimism and disappointment, under the encouragement of the responsible comrades of some counties who personally led the drainage and helped farmers pull plows, they finally improved their confidence and seized the last season of autumn planting to rush to plant in the mud, so that the wheat planting in the entire prefecture generally reached the level of 1948.

Shandong also achieved significant results in the fight against drought and insect pests. From the beginning of spring to the beginning of July last year, the entire province of Shandong generally fought against drought. In April, May, June, and August, it successively suffered four hailstorms, covering 15 prefectures (only the Jiaodong Beihai Prefecture was spared), with a damaged area of 1.42 million mu. At the same time, it suffered from more than 30 kinds of insect pests, damaging 7.56 million mu of crops. Wheat bunt also spread to 32 counties. The Shandong Branch of the CPC Central Committee and the Shandong Provincial People's Government led the people of the province to put forward various methods of production and self-rescue based on various disaster situations, and fought stubbornly against the famine. In terms of drought resistance, the slogans of "Drilling wells and digging ditches, watering and planting," "Watering one more ladle of water, harvesting one more bowl of grain" were implemented. The Bohai area alone dug more than 62,600 wells and watered and planted more than 620,000 mu of cotton. Most areas of Jiaodong completed 80% of the plan to water and plant corn. In terms of insect pest control, insect-stricken areas established insect pest control headquarters to uniformly guide farmers to capture and kill pests. Taishan Prefecture mobilized 500,000 people to basically eliminate all cotton insects in half a month; nearly one million people participated in the insect pest control campaign in the Bohai area, quickly eradicating locusts and cotton insects. As a result of the tenacious struggle of all the people, Shandong Province achieved an average of 60% of the autumn harvest last year.

For the more than 1,000 villages and 200,000 disaster victims in the Huaihai battlefield - Nianzhuang, Shuangduiji, and Xiao (County), Su (County), and Yong (City) areas, which were frantically destroyed by the Kuomintang bandits, the People's Government carried out emergency relief, allocating and distributing more than 47 million catties of relief grain, and also sent disaster relief work teams to help the suffering people restore production. Now the people of the area have rebuilt their homes from the ruins, and more than 3,500 new houses have been rebuilt in Shuangduiji alone. Farming livestock and farm tools have also recovered to about 80%.

In addition to fighting against the above-mentioned various disasters, the People's Government also carried out emergency relief in various disaster-stricken areas and mobilized the broad masses of people to carry out production and self-rescue. Local production and disaster relief committees, government trade departments, and cooperatives vigorously organized disaster victims to engage in sideline production. The Anhui North Administrative Office approved and allocated 2 million catties of grain and 300 million yuan (equivalent to 1 million catties of grain) to organize local product companies to specialize in purchasing sideline products and supporting the sideline production of disaster victims. Various localities organized various types of sideline production based on their unique conditions, such as fishing, shrimp, water caltrop harvesting, and lotus root harvesting in water areas, and firewood gathering, alkali boiling, mat weaving, and oil extraction in mountainous areas. Sideline production played a significant role in disaster relief. For example, 300,000 disaster victims in the Bin Hai area of Shandong and 450,000 disaster victims in the Huaiyin area of northern Jiangsu survived last year's spring famine by relying on sideline production. Disaster victims in Jiashan, Xuyi, Jiangpu, Wangjiang and other counties in northern Anhui also solved the difficulties of lacking food and wheat seeds last autumn through sideline production such as fishing, lotus root harvesting, and firewood cutting. Through the organization of sideline production, cooperatives in various parts of East China have developed considerably, especially in the old liberated areas. In Luzhongnan alone, the number of members participating in marketing cooperatives has reached more than 2 million. The Bohai area has developed more than 75,800 new members. Cooperatives in disaster areas such as southern Anhui and southern Jiangsu are also actively implementing the business policy of serving disaster victims in order to develop. At present, cooperatives along the Yangtze and Huai rivers are generally responsible for supplying the daily necessities of river workers.

In 1949, although the people of East China achieved the above-mentioned achievements in the struggle against famine, the disaster situation in various places is still extremely serious. At present, East China is resolutely implementing the instructions of the Government Administration Council and the East China Bureau of the CPC Central Committee on production and disaster relief, continuing to vigorously organize disaster victims for production and self-rescue, using work as relief, repairing river dikes, and launching social mutual assistance. The people of East China are full of confidence and believe that under the correct leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and governments at all levels, with the help and support of fraternal regions throughout the country, as long as they are sincerely united, work hard, are not pessimistic, are not paralyzed, and give full play to the rich experience accumulated over the years in defeating the enemy and overcoming disasters, the severe spring famine of 1950 will surely be overcome.

　　与空前严重的灾荒艰苦奋战中的华东人民
    ·孙恩诚·
    解放了的华东区一万万数千万人民正在与空前严重的灾荒进行艰苦的斗争。
    十多年来，在抗日战争中与人民解放战争中遭受日寇和国民党匪帮严重破坏的华东地区，一九四九年，又遭遇了空前严重的大灾难。首先是国民党匪军在溃逃时的烧杀抢掠所造成的破坏，仅据歼灭国民党匪军六十万人的淮海战场的宿县、永城、萧县等地不完全的统计，被匪军毁灭的村庄即有一千三百三十二个，毁坏房屋七万三千九百十九间，被匪军杀死的人民二千八百七十二人，受伤者一千八百九十五人，损失牲口一万二千六百零三头；直接遭受蒋灾的共三万四千一百五十六户，约二十余万人。而去年春夏秋三季，鲁、苏、皖各地又先后发生水、旱、台、雹、虫、疫病等灾害，受灾面积五千三百四十四万亩，灾民达一千六百四十二万人，其中尤以皖北、苏北、山东等地的水灾最重：皖北受灾面积一千七百八十九万亩，灾民八百万人（重灾人口四百四十多万）；苏北受灾面积一千七百七十六万亩，灾民四百五十万人；山东受灾面积一千二百四十八万亩，灾民三百三十二万人。
    虽然灾情是这样的重大而普遍，但并没有把华东人民吓倒。英勇的华东人民，一致团结在中共中央华东局和各级人民政府的正确领导下，一面倾力支援前线，一面与接踵而来的灾荒进行了不屈不挠的斗争，终于使得一千数百万灾民，胜利地渡过了一九四九年。
    且让我们来回顾一下华东区一年来生产救灾的经过和成绩吧。
    首先，自一九四九年春开始，为防止水患，沿长江、淮河、黄河、运河及黄海沿岸各地人民政府曾动员了巨大力量，抢修为国民党匪军破坏的各堤坝。苏北一地即组织了四十二万民工修治运河、洪泽湖、长江、淮河、范公堤等主要大堤共二千余华里，疏通河流一百九十余条。夏初、各地霪雨连绵，江河水位普遍高涨，皖北山洪暴发，各堤圩纷纷告急。中共中央华东局当即发出紧急指示，动员党政军民有重点地突击防汛抢险，并充分组织后备力量，准备随时投入抢救。各地随即建立了防汛抢险组织，由党员、干部带头与成千成万的沿堤居民日夜驻守堤防；各地驻军也大部开赴堤岸协助抢险，仅第三野战军驻宁沪杭部队即前后共出十万人工，协助居民堵堤近百华里，抢救水淹禾田十万余亩。去年伏汛期间，山东省人民政府、山东军区、中共中央山东分局及济南市委会等机关工作人员一万七千多人，和当地群众、部队、学生二十余万人组成了一条活的堤防，日日夜夜与黄水顽强搏斗，经过四十天，终于战胜了一万秒立方公尺流量以上的滚滚黄水，使大堤未遭决口（在历史上一般黄水在四千秒立方公尺流量就可能决口）皖北参加抢护长江、淮河两堤的人民达三百五十万人。苏北地区仅高邮县即发动与组织了三十二万人民、二万三千余部踏车和风车、一百零两部抽水机，日夜戽水排洪，营救出苏北沿江各地秋苗四、五百万亩。经过紧张抢救，各地均安渡六月大汛。七月下旬，江苏东部及胶东沿江沿海地区又遭台风侵袭，各地党与政府的领导干部率领人民在“人定胜天”、“救圩如救命”的口号下，与惊涛骇浪顽强搏斗，涌现了无数可歌可泣的英雄事迹。扬州田家港当江水将漫堤时，三百余农民赶至伏卧堤上，堵住江水，待器材运到；窑家桥农民因器材一时赶运不及，大家以臂膀挽着臂膀跪在堤上，用身子作堰抵挡洪水达一小时之久，直至器材赶到使堤防转危为安，有的人竟因抢险光荣牺牲了自己的生命。上海市郊吴淞、高桥、洋泾、江湾等区及宝山、川沙、南汇、奉贤等县海塘，解放后虽经初步抢修，不意七月遭猛烈台风袭击，大部海塘被冲毁，大的决口计有四十二处，仅南汇一县从新闸港到三灶港、从塘角子到汇角全长八十里的海塘塘基被冲去三分之二，受灾群众约四十万人。当时松江专署与上海市人民政府立即动员六、七万工人、农民、学生、医生、和上海市警备部队、机关工作人员，克服了工具、材料、交通运输等困难，经一个月的艰苦斗争，先后修复南汇、川沙和宝山等地共百余华里海塘，使上海市及其附近各县一千数百万人民安渡八月大汛。当时，另外有许多江堤河岸部分堤身因亏损太重，经过三四次洪水袭击之后，终于无法挽救而决口。如南通、泰州两专区江堤决口百余处，皖北自宿松至望江间的马华大堤亦全部崩溃，沿江千里一片汪洋。其他有许多地方也同时遭受水灾。但各地人民政府仍再接再厉领导人民组织排水，抢救秋禾，仅苏北即动员了七百十四万人于数日内抢救出秋禾一千零九十八万亩，因而获得了六成秋收。皖北在巢湖、六安地区曾掀起三百万人以上的大出水运动，全区共救出三百万亩田禾。截至十二月底为止，全华东已救出可耕地达二千六百六十八万亩。
    各地紧接防汛抢险之后，提出了“水退一分补种一分，水退一亩补种一亩”的口号，组织农民补种。各级领导干部都亲自下乡组织群众抢耕抢种。缺种子的地区除发动群众自筹互借外，人民政府并有重点地贷给大量麦种、菜籽等，解决灾民的种子困难，仅苏北、皖北、苏南等地即贷出种粮近三千万斤。此外各地都帮助灾区农民适当地解决耕牛农具等困难，如动员非灾区与灾区实行耕牛调剂，灾区群众有组织地向友邻地区雇借了耕牛等；牛力极缺乏的地区，则组织人力拖田、挖地。因此，被淹地区在水退之后，不但及时补种了菜、豆、芝麻、萝卜、高粱、荞麦等晚秋粮，而且大部地区于十一月底至十二月初都先后完成了秋种，苏北于十一月中旬即胜利完成近五千万亩的种麦任务。在灾情最重的皖北宿县专区虽经三种三淹，部分群众曾表现悲观失望，但在有些县的负责同志亲自领导排水、帮助农民拉犁的鼓励下，终于信心提高，也抓紧秋种最后季节，在烂泥中全力抢种，使全专区种麦一般仍达到一九四八年水平。
    山东在抗旱、捕虫斗争中，也获得了重大成绩。山东去年入春后至七月初全省各地普遍抗旱，四、五、六、八月，先后遭受四次雹灾，遍及十五个专区（仅胶东北海专区幸免）被害面积达一百四十二万亩。与此同时又遭受三十多种虫害，损伤禾苗达七百五十六万亩。小麦腥黑穗病，也遍及三十二个县。中共中央山东分局和山东省人民政府即领导全省人民，根据各种不同灾情提出多种生产自救办法，与灾荒顽强地斗争。在抗旱方面，实行“打井挖沟，挑水点种”，“多浇一瓢水，多打一碗粮”等口号，单渤海区就挖井六万二千六百余眼，挑水点种棉花六十二万余亩。胶东大部地区都完成挑水点种苞米的计划百分之八十。在捕虫方面，虫灾严重地区，成立了捕虫指挥部，统一指导农民捕打害虫。泰山区曾动员五十万人在半个月的时间内即基本上消灭全部棉虫；渤海区前后共有百万人参加捕虫运动，把蝗虫和棉虫迅速扑灭。经过全体人民顽强斗争的结果，去年山东全省获得了平均六成的秋收。
    对于淮海战场——碾庄、双堆集、和萧（县）、宿（县）、永（城）地区被国民党匪帮疯狂破坏的一千多村庄及二十万难胞，人民政府曾进行了紧急救济，共拨发救济粮四千七百余万斤，同时又派了救灾工作队帮助受难人民恢复生产。现该地人民已从废墟上重建家园，仅双堆集一地即已重建新屋达三千五百余间。耕畜农具也恢复了百分之八十左右。
    除了与上述各种灾难作斗争外，人民政府并在各受灾区进行急赈和发动广大人民进行生产自救。各地生产救灾委员会，政府贸易部门和合作社等都大力组织灾民从事副业生产，皖北行署并批拨粮食二百万斤和人民币三亿元（约合一百万斤粮）组织土产公司，专门收购副业产品，扶植灾民的副业生产。各地则根据特有条件，组织多种多样的副业生产，如水地捕鱼、捞虾、采菱、踩藕，山地拾柴、熬碱、编席、打油等。副业生产在救灾中所起作用很大，如在山东滨海区三十万灾民及苏北淮阴区四十五万灾民即靠副业生产而渡过了去年的春荒。皖北、嘉山、盱眙、江浦、望江等县灾民，去秋也以捕鱼、踩藕、砍柴等副业生产解决了缺少口粮与麦种的困难。通过组织副业生产，华东各地合作社都得到相当发展，特别是老解放区发展更为迅速，仅鲁中南一地，目前参加运销合作社的社员已达两百万人以上。渤海区发展新社员七万五千八百余名。皖南、苏南等地灾区合作社，也正积极贯彻为灾民服务的业务方针以求开展。目前沿长江、淮河地区的合作社，普遍担负着供应河工日常生活必需品的任务。
    在一九四九年，华东人民与灾荒斗争，虽获得上述的成绩，但是目前各地灾荒还是异常严重的。目前华东各地正在坚决执行政务院和中共中央华东局关于生产救灾的指示，继续以大力组织灾民生产自救，以工代赈，修治河堤，并发动社会互济。华东人民满怀信心，相信在中国共产党和各级人民政府的正确领导下，在全国各兄弟区的帮助和支援下，只要精诚团结，艰苦奋斗，不悲观，不麻痹，充分发挥多年战胜敌人，克服灾荒的丰富经验，则一九五○年的严重春荒，是一定能够战胜的。
