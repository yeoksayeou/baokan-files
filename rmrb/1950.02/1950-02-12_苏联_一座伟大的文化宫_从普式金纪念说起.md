The Soviet Union—A Great Palace of Culture
    Starting with the Pushkin Commemoration
    Xiao San

    "The entire Soviet Union has become a temple to Pushkin," – this insightful remark was made by Pablo Neruda, the great Chilean poet, one of the eighteen foreign writers who participated in the grand celebrations of Pushkin's 150th birth anniversary last June.

    I recall that even several months before the anniversary, the entire Soviet Union, as well as some places abroad, had already begun to welcome the memorial celebration of this great Russian poet. We departed from Beijing for Paris-Prague at the end of March last year to attend the World Peace Congress. In early April, while passing through various stations along the Siberian Railway, we went out to buy local newspapers; upon arriving in Moscow, we also saw the capital's newspapers. At that time, all the newspapers were already filled with news about Pushkin commemorations from various places: gatherings organized in certain locations, reports given on the poet by certain individuals, publications of treatises on the poet by certain individuals in certain places, and how certain places, schools, and groups were studying and reciting Pushkin's poetry...

    After the World Peace Congress concluded in Prague, we returned to Moscow at the end of April; participated in the "May Day" parade on Red Square; visited many museums, libraries, and educational, production, and cultural constructions; and met many writers, artists, and scientists... Everyone's mind was filled with these impressions. But what everyone deeply felt, saw with their own eyes, and personally experienced was: the culture, literature, art, science, and education of the Soviet Union are truly flourishing, truly vibrant, and truly a garden of a hundred flowers in full bloom. In a word, the entire Soviet state is a great palace of culture!

    On the days of the Pushkin commemoration, this palace of culture appeared even more magnificent, extremely beautiful, and exceptionally brilliant.

    Invited by the All-Soviet Pushkin Committee, I was fortunate enough to visit the Soviet Union again during those days. From the first day of entry, on the road in Siberia, and in Moscow, Leningrad, Pushkin City, Pskov, Mikhailovskoye Village, Stalingrad, Kiev, etc., what I saw could be described as: all cities and villages throughout the Soviet Union, all streets and squares, all institutions, enterprises, schools, and houses, without exception, were filled with decorations commemorating Pushkin. I remember that everywhere were portraits of the poet – hanging on tall buildings, pasted on the walls of school clubs, embedded on the fronts of cars and trams, pinned on the backs of collective farmers' horses pulling carts, drawn in primary school students' practice books or printed on chocolate candy wrappers – in various sizes. Everywhere were lines of the poet's verses – in addition to large red banners, the most common were long wooden boards inscribed with his verses, nailed to the walls of houses; or the wooden boards were fitted with posts and nailed to the main roads and squares (this was particularly abundant along the road of about fifty miles from Leningrad to Pushkin City, almost every two or three hundred steps). Furthermore, everywhere were illustrations of Pushkin's narrative poems – such as "The Tale of the Fisherman and the Fish," "The Tale of the Priest and of His Workman Balda," "The Tale of Tsar Saltan, of His Son...and of the Beautiful Swan Princess"... Walking among those pictures, one feels as if one is touring the "fairyland" of the stories.

    I remember that almost all the glass windows of shops, large and small, displayed Pushkin's portraits and poems. The large glass windows on the ground floor of several buildings along Gorky Street in Moscow were specially decorated with stage photos of various operas and ballets adapted from Pushkin's poems, as well as large photos of places related to Pushkin's life and works.

    All the shopping malls and mobile book and stationery stalls were mostly selling portraits of the poet and colorful postcards related to his life and works during this period.

    As for Pushkin's works, oh, there were incredibly many of them! During these days, almost all the bookstores (and there were especially many of them in cities like Moscow and Leningrad) were selling his complete works, selections, separate editions, and his portraits. The complete works, selections, etc., were printed by various publishing bureaus, in large, medium, and small sizes, all bound very beautifully – anyone who has bought a hardcover book of Soviet literature knows that its binding can be described as luxurious. And the prices were extremely cheap. Such books were not only sold in bookstores. During this period, they could be bought in various markets and at newsstands. For example, at the opening ceremony of the Pushkin Museum in Pushkin City, the corridors at the entrance of the museum were filled with countless kinds of Pushkin's works that attracted attendees, as well as many, many books by literary historians and critics studying the poet.

    I remember Fadeyev saying in his opening speech at the Pushkin 150th anniversary celebration at the Bolshoi Theatre in Moscow that since the establishment of the Soviet regime, Pushkin's works had been published in 76 languages with 56 million copies in the Soviet Union. This means that on average, every family in the Soviet Union had a copy of Pushkin's works, and the entire Soviet Union held Pushkin's legacy in their hands. Simonov further elaborated in his report at the conference that within the 32 years after the October Revolution, 45 million copies of Pushkin's works were published in the Soviet Union, and another 11 million copies were specially published on the anniversary...

    – This is conceivable. But I should tell the readers that even with so many books published, the supply still could not meet the demand. Because the number of readers in the Soviet Union is constantly increasing, and the quantity of all books, publications, and especially newspapers still cannot fully satisfy the needs of readers: every time a new book comes out, it quickly sells out in the market, and those who arrive late can only regretfully miss out. To say nothing else, when I asked an old friend in the Foreign Literature Committee of the Soviet Writers' Union for a medium-sized edition of Pushkin's complete works, he had to make some effort to find one. When he gave it to me, he did not hide his triumphant expression of being "a good friend."

    Books, just based on the quantity and quality of published books alone, the entire Soviet Union is truly a great library, a great school!

    Every factory and collective farm has its own library – that goes without saying. Almost every worker and farmer has their own bookshelf or cabinet at home. Every worker in the fields of culture, literature, art, science, education, and technology has their own rich collection of books, which goes without saying even more. Almost every primary school student also has their own small library at home. Speaking of this, I am immensely envious of the happiness of Soviet children: for them, there is a national specialized children's literature publishing bureau. For them, the Soviet Writers' Union specially convened a plenary session to discuss children's literature. It can be said that Soviet children, from the time they start learning to speak, sing, listen to stories, to learning to read, and going to school, are immersed in the sea of literature and art from a very young age!

    And on the days commemorating Pushkin, how much of the poet's work could Soviet children hear and read. Which kindergarten, primary school, and middle school does not recite and perform Pushkin's works!

    An old revolutionary, now a comrade in charge of work in a certain organization, once told me in a casual conversation that he and many of his friends loved to read Pushkin when they were young. Therefore, he said: Pushkin is truly a poet of the people.

    A newly famous writer – Boris Polevoy – said in his speech at the celebration held in the Pskov City State Drama Theatre that during the Patriotic War, after a certain guerrilla fighter died in battle, a small collection of Pushkin's poems was found in his pocket, in addition to Stalin's proclamations and orders issued during the war, reportedly because Pushkin's poems could help and further arouse the soldiers' love for their motherland. Therefore, Polevoy shouted a slogan at the end of his speech: "Long live Comrade Pushkin!"

    This is truly the poet's greatest glory!

    In a poem titled "Exegi monumentum" written by Pushkin in 1836 (the year before his death), he said:

    "I have erected to myself a monument, not made by hands,
    The people's path to it will not be overgrown" ...

    "No, I shall not wholly die; but in my song survive,
    When my dust shall perish, my spirit will live."

    "And long shall I be dear to the folk" ...

    These predictions of the poet have now been fully realized. But Pushkin's glory, the glory of his motherland – the Soviet Union – does not stop there. It has now exceeded the poet's imagination. If he had said in that poem:

    "And my fame shall run throughout great Russia's land,
    And every tongue shall name thy name", then, now his fame has spread all over the globe, and all the languages ​​existing in the world are speaking his name.

    Look, during those days of celebrating the poet's commemoration centrally in Moscow, whether at the open-air gatherings held in Pushkin Square in front of the poet's bronze statue, or at the commemorative gatherings held in the State Opera and Ballet Theatre and in the Hall of Columns of the House of Unions, and later in Leningrad, in Pushkin City, in the school he studied in, in front of the poet's tomb, in Mikhailovskoye Village where he was exiled... In all the commemorative meetings, in addition to representatives of the various Union Republics of the Soviet Union, there were people from a total of seventeen countries from South America to China. The great Russian national and people's poet – Alexander Pushkin – has international significance. Because the influence of his great genius has not only spread to "Great Russia" – today united into an "indestructible union of free republics" and the Slavic brotherly nations; at the same time, his poems, directly through the great Russian literature that inherits it, have powerfully and brilliantly flowed into the world's great torrent of human culture.

    It is very interesting and significant. I remember that at the commemorative meetings in the Bolshoi Theatre and the Hall of Columns of the House of Unions in Moscow, and later at many meetings, the representatives of the cultural and literary circles of the various Soviet republics all mentioned Pushkin's influence on their country's literature; in addition to talking about this point, they and foreign writers mostly mentioned the names of their country's greatest poets and writers. Everyone had to say this, mainly because they naturally thought of their own historical and cultural heritage after seeing the Soviet Union respect its historical and cultural heritage so much. Therefore, in my speech at that meeting, I mentioned Qu Yuan to Lu Xun in our country, and Becher in Germany mentioned Goethe, and Stangu in Romania mentioned Eminescu... The Hungarian writer Gergely Sándor even more frankly stated at the conference held in Pskov that the Hungarian people only knew their ancient poets because of Pushkin.

    This is completely true and natural. When the regime is in the hands of reactionary groups, one's own culture and art are never respected. What reactionaries respect is money, weapons, and all the sharp weapons that destroy culture. Capitalism hates poetry – Marx said so. And when the people become the masters of their own country, they especially respect their history and the fine traditions of their culture.

    Take Pushkin as an example. In the Tsarist era, from 1907 to 1916, within these ten years, his works were only published in 5.1 million copies. But from 1917 to 1936, within these ten years, 21 million copies were published. Another number. In the old Russian era from 1907 to 1916, only 13 Pushkin books were translated into the languages ​​of various ethnic groups, with a total of 35,000 copies. But in 1936 alone, more than one million copies were published in the languages ​​of fifty ethnic groups. (As mentioned above, in the 32 years under the Soviet regime, 56 million copies have been published in the languages ​​of 76 ethnic groups.)

    Therefore, Fadeyev spoke with full justification, "Only the October Revolution and more than 30 years of the Soviet regime and the Communist education of the Bolshevik Party for the people have made Pushkin's legacy a true property of the people, and revealed the true significance of his genius to the people."

    Just from the commemoration of Pushkin alone, it should be affirmed: The Soviet Union is truly a great palace of culture!

　　苏联——一座伟大的文化宫
    从普式金纪念说起
    萧三
    “整个苏联都成了普式金的神庙”，——参加了去年六月普式金一百五十岁诞辰庆祝大典的十八个外国作家之一，智利大诗人巴勃罗·聂鲁达（PabloNeruda）的这句话，说得真妙。
    记得还是在诞辰之前好几个月，苏联全国各地，以及外国某些地方就都已开始迎接这位俄罗斯伟大诗人的冥寿纪念。我们是去年三月底由北京启程赴巴黎——布拉格参加世界保卫和平大会的。四月初经过西伯利亚铁路各个车站时，就下去买当地的报纸；到了莫斯科又看到首都的报纸。那时所有的报纸上面，就都已有了各地纪念普式金的新闻：某地某组织集会，某人作关于诗人的报告，某地出版某人关于诗人的论著，某地某学校某团体如何研究、朗诵普式金的诗……
    我们在布拉格开完了世界保卫和平大会之后，四月底回到了莫斯科；参加了红场上的“五一”大检阅；参观了许多博物馆、图书馆，以及教育的、生产的、文化的等等建设；会见了许多文学家、艺术家、科学家……这些印象每个人都堆满了一脑子。但大家特别深刻地感觉到，亲眼看到和亲身接触到的是：苏联的文化、文学、艺术、科学、教育真是繁荣、昌盛，真是百花竞放，万紫千红。一句话，整个苏联国家就是一座伟大的文化宫！
    当普式金纪念的日子，这座文化宫更显得分外堂皇，非常美丽、特别辉煌。
    由于全苏普式金委员会的邀请，笔者很幸运地就在那些日子里又到了苏联。从入境的第一天起，在西伯利亚的路上，以及在莫斯科、列宁格勒、普式金城、普斯可夫、米海洛夫村、斯大林格勒、基辅等等地方所见到的，可以说是：全苏联所有的城市和乡村，一切街道和广场，一切机关、企业、学校和住屋，没有例外地都布满了纪念普式金的装璜。我记得，到处都是诗人的肖像挂在高楼大厦的，贴在学校俱乐部墙上的，嵌在汽车电车车头的，插在集体农民拉车的马背上的，画在小学生练习簿上或印在巧克力糖的纸包上的——有大有小。到处都是诗人的诗句——用大幅红布写的以外，最多的却是用长大的木板，写上他的诗句，钉在屋宇的墙壁上；或者木板下面装上桩脚，钉在通衢大道和广场上（这在由列宁格勒到普式金城约五十里的大路两旁特别多，几乎每隔二、三百步就有一块）。再则，到处都是普式金故事诗的图画——什么《渔翁和小鱼的故事》，《牧师和他的工人巴尔达的故事》，《关于萨尔丹皇帝，他的儿子……和美丽的天鹅宫主的故事》……在各个大地方，特别是在米海洛夫村的草场上，高高的木架，五颜六色的屋子呀，海呀，鱼呀，金公鸡呀，老头呀，老太婆呀，皇帝呀，公主呀，……你走在那些图画中间，就好像是游那故事的“仙境”。
    记得，差不多所有大小商店的玻璃窗里都是普式金的像和诗。莫斯科高尔基大街一连几栋大厦的下面一层的大玻璃窗里，特别陈列了根据普式金的诗作所排演的各种歌剧、舞剧的舞台照片，以及凡是与普式金的生活和创作有关的地方的大幅照片。
    所有的商场以及流动小书文具摊，这一向卖的多是关于诗人的像和与他生活创作有关的五彩明信片。
    至于普式金的著作，呵，这更是了不得的多！各大小书店（而这在莫斯科、列宁格勒等城市又是特别多的）在这些日子里几乎全是销售他的全集、选集、单行本，和他的画像。全集选集等等是由各个出版局印的，有大号本的，中号的和小小号的，都装订得非常漂亮——凡是买过苏联文艺的精装书的都知道，它的装订简直可说是奢华极了。而价钱又极便宜。这样的书不但在书店里卖。这一向，在各市场，各书报摊上都可以买到。比方在普式金城所举行的普式金博物馆开幕仪式时，博物馆进口处的走廊上就摆满了吸引到会者的无数种类的普式金的创作，和文学史家与批评研究者关于诗人的许多许多的书。
    记得法捷耶夫在莫斯科大戏院纪念普式金百五十岁的大会上致开幕词中说了，自有苏维埃政权以来，普式金的著作在苏联用七十六种文字出版了五千六百万份。这就是说，在苏联平均每一个家庭都有一部普式金的著作，全苏联的人都捧着普式金的遗产在自己的手里。西蒙诺夫在大会上作的报告中又具体讲到，十月革命后三十二年之内，普式金的创作在苏联出版了四千五百万份，而在纪念的日期又特别出版了一千一百万份……
    ——这就可想而知了。但我应当告诉读者一下的是，出版了这样多的书，还是供不应求。因为苏联的读者不断地增加，一切书籍、刊物，尤其是报纸的数量现在还是不能充分地满足读者的需要的：每每一本新书出来，在市场上很快便卖光了，后到的只有向隅。不说别的，我向苏维埃作家联盟外国文学委员会的一位老朋友索一部中号的普式金全集时，他都经过一番努力才找到。在送给我的时候，他并不隐瞒自己“够朋友”的得意的脸色。
    书，就单凭出版书籍的数量和质量一点来说，整个苏联就真是一座伟大的图书馆，一所伟大的学校！
    每个工厂和集体农场都有自己的图书馆——这不消说了。差不多工人和农民的家里都有自己的图书架子或柜子。每个文化文学艺术科学教育技术的工作者都有自己丰富的图书，这更不消说了。差不多每个小学生在家里也有自己的小小的图书馆。说到这里，我万分羡慕苏联儿童的幸福：为了他们，设有国立的专门的儿童文学出版局。为了他们，苏维埃作家联盟特别召集全会讨论儿童文学。苏联的孩子们，可以说，从开始学着讲话到唱歌、听故事，到识字、上学，总之从很小的年龄起就都浸浴在文学艺术的大海里面了！
    而在纪念普式金的日子里，苏联的儿童可以听到和读到多少诗人的创作呵。那一个幼稚园和小学中学里不朗诵和扮演普式金的创作！
    一位老革命，现在作某机关负责工作的同志，一次在闲谈中对我说述，他和他的许多朋友，在小时就都爱读普式金。因此他说：普式金真是人民的诗人。
    一位新著名的作家——波利斯·玻列伏依在普斯可夫城州立话戏院里举行的庆祝大会上致词时说，这次卫国战争中，某地某游击队员战死之后，发现在他的口袋里，除斯大林在战争时所发表的文告命令等等外，有一小本普式金的诗集，据说是因为普式金的诗能够帮助和更加引起战士们对祖国的热爱。因此玻列伏依在他致词的结尾喊了一句口号：“普式金同志万岁！”
    这真是诗人最大的光荣！
    普式金于一八三六年（去世的前一年）写的一首诗《纪念碑》中说：
    “我给自己立下了神工创造的纪念碑，
    民众到那儿去的径路上不会生长青草”……
    “不，我不会死的——灵魂在珍贵的诗歌里
    比我的骨灰活得长久，也不会腐烂——”
    “我将永久地和人民亲近”……
    诗人的这些预言，现在完全实现了。但普式金的光荣，他的祖国——苏联的光荣还不止于此。现在是超过诗人所想像的了。假如他在那首诗里曾说：
    “我的名声将在伟大的俄罗斯到处流传，
    它现有的一切语言都会讲着我的名字”，那么，现在他的名声已经在全地球上面到处流传，全世界现存的一切的语言都讲着他的名字了。
    看，集中地在莫斯科庆祝纪念诗人的那些日子里，无论是在普式金广场，在诗人铜像跟前举行的露天大会上，无论是在国立歌舞大戏院和在职工大厦圆柱厅所举行的纪念大会上，以及后来在列宁格勒，在普式金城，他念过书的学校里，在诗人的墓前，在他被流放过的米海洛夫村……所有的纪念会上，除苏联各个加盟共和国的代表之外，还有从南美洲到中国一共十七个国土来的人们参加。伟大的俄罗斯民族的和人民的诗人——亚列山大·普式金是具有国际的意义的。因为他的巨大天才的影响，既普及于“伟大的俄罗斯”——今天团结成为“自由共和国不可摧毁的联盟”和斯拉夫各兄弟民族；同时他的诗作直接通过继承它的伟大俄罗斯文学，有力地和光辉地汇入了人类文化的世界巨流里面。
    很有趣味和意义的，记得在莫斯科大戏院和职工大厦圆柱厅的纪念大会上，以及后来许多大会上，苏联各个共和国的文化文学界的代表无一不说到普式金对他们本国文学的影响；他们和外国作家们除都讲到这一层之外，还大都举出自己本国最伟大的诗人作家的名字来。大家都要这样说，主要的是，由于看到苏联这样尊重自己的历史文化遗产，便自然也想到自己的历史文化遗产来。因此笔者在那个会上的讲话就提到我国的屈原到鲁迅，德国的倍歇尔就提到哥德，罗马尼亚的斯唐古就提到艾米聂斯古……匈牙利作家格尔格·商多尔在普斯可夫城举行的大会上更坦白地说道，匈牙利的人民由于普式金才知道自己的古代的诗人。
    这完全是真的，自然的。当政权握在反动集团的手里的时候，对于自己的文化艺术是从来不尊重的。反动派尊重的是金钱，是武装，是摧毁文化的一切利器。资本主义是仇视诗歌的——马克思这样说过。而当人民作了自己国家主人的时候，特别尊重自己的历史，自己文化的优良传统。
    就拿普式金为例吧。在沙皇时代，从一九○七年到一九一六年，这十年之内，他的著作只出版过五百一十万份。可是从一九一七年到一九三六年这十年之内就出版了二千一百万份。又一个数目字。一九○七——一九一六年旧俄时代用各民族文字翻译普式金的书只出版过十三部，共三万五千份。但在一九三六这一年之内，就用五十种民族的文字出版了一百万份以上。（上面已经说了，三十二年来在苏维埃政权下，已经有七十六种民族的文字，出版了五千六百万份）。
    因此法捷耶夫完全有根据地讲到，“只有十月革命和三十多年苏维埃政权及布尔什维克党对人民的共产主义教育，才使得普式金的遗著成为真正人民的财产，并表露出他的天才对人民的真正意义”。
    就单从纪念普式金这一件事来看，也应该肯定说：苏联真是一座伟大的文化宫！
