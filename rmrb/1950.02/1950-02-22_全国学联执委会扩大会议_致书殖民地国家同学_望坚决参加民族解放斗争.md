Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, February 21st: The All-China Students' Federation's Fourteenth Executive Committee held its second enlarged meeting on the 20th and passed a letter to students in colonial and semi-colonial countries. The full text is as follows: Dear students in colonial and semi-colonial countries:

　　Today, the second enlarged meeting of the Fourteenth Executive Committee of the All-China Students' Federation opened in Beijing. On the eve of the "Day of Struggle Against the Colonial System," all the executive committee members present extend our fraternal greetings to you who are engaged in heroic struggles against imperialist enslavement on behalf of students across the country!

　　Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, the Chinese people, after years of arduous struggle, have overthrown the reactionary rule of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism, and are now steadily embarking on economic and cultural construction on a national scale. Due to the victory of the Chinese People's Liberation War, Chinese students have also been given the opportunity to study hard under the new democratic education, preparing to better contribute their knowledge and skills to participate in the construction of the new China.

　　We believe that your heroic struggle against imperialism and the colonial system will achieve final victory just like us. We hope that you will unite all patriotic students to further integrate closely with workers, peasants, and all patriotic democratic forces, abandon any illusions about imperialism and its running dogs, and resolutely participate in the national liberation movement and national liberation war, in order to strive for the early realization of your national independence and freedom.

　　Long live the great unity of democratic youth and students of the world!

　　Long live the victory of the national liberation struggles in colonial and semi-colonial countries!

　　The Second Enlarged Meeting of the Fourteenth Executive Committee of the All-China Students' Federation

　　February 20, 1950
