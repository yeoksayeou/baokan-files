Mayor Nie Reports on Municipal Government Work Plan
	Calls for Utmost Effort to Achieve It

Mayor Nie, in his report, stated that 1949, both for the nation as a whole and for Beijing specifically, was a year of great change. During this year, we made great efforts to destroy the remaining reactionary forces, establish and consolidate revolutionary order, restore and develop the production of public and private industries and agriculture, and develop the people's cultural and educational undertakings; we also achieved considerable success. In terms of municipal construction, although limited by manpower and financial resources, it was impossible to achieve much, but we also did some necessary work. Our work plan for 1950 is based on the work and achievements of 1949, and was formulated after a relatively accurate estimation of the financial strength and all objective conditions for 1950: First, to continue to consolidate the revolutionary order; Second, to vigorously restore and develop production, which is our overriding central task for 1950; Third, to appropriately develop cultural, educational, and health undertakings that serve production and the working people; Fourth, to carry out necessary municipal construction work with a focus; Fifth, to take planned measures to relieve unemployment and other related social welfare measures. After reporting on the specific work content of the above plan, Mayor Nie Rongzhen said: "We have formulated this plan after a long period of deliberation, many discussions, and repeated revisions. On the one hand, this is because our experience in managing the city is still insufficient; on the other hand, it is also because we must be serious and responsible and handle things with caution. I hope everyone will not hesitate to criticize and correct this plan and review it. Once the conference approves it, we will do everything possible to strive for its realization (full text of the report will be issued separately)."

　　聂市长报告市政府工作计划
    号召尽全力促其实现
    聂市长在报告中说明一九四九年，不论就全国说，不论就北京市说，都是伟大变化的一年。在这一年中，我们在摧毁残余的反动势力，建立和巩固革命秩序，恢复和发展公私营工业和农业的生产，以及发展人民的文化教育事业上，曾经作了很大的努力，也曾获得不小的成绩。在市政建设方面，虽为人力财力所限制，不可能多所建树，但也做了一些必要的工作。我们的一九五○年度工作计划就是以一九四九年的工作及其成绩为基础，并比较精确地估计了一九五○年度的财政力量和一切客观条件而拟订的：第一、继续巩固革命秩序；第二、大力恢复和发展生产，这是我们一九五○年度，压倒一切的中心任务：第三、适当发展为生产服务、为劳动人民服务的文教卫生事业；第四、有重点地进行必要的市政建设工作；第五、有计划地采取救济失业及其它有关社会福利的措施。聂荣臻市长于报告了上列计划的具体工作内容后，说：“我们拟订这个计划，曾经过长期酝酿，多次讨论，一再修改。这一方面，是由于我们管理城市的经验还很不够，另一方面，也由于我们对工作不能不严肃负责和慎重将事。我希望大家对这个计划，不客气地批评指正，加以审查。一俟大会通过后，我们就要尽一切努力为它的实现而奋斗（报告全文另发）。
