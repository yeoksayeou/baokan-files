　　Statement by Spokesperson of the China Zhi Gong Party in Beijing
    Protest Against the Thai Government's Persecution of Overseas Chinese
    Vow to Exert All Efforts to Assist Overseas Chinese in Distress to Regain Their Rights
    [Beijing News] The spokesperson of the China Zhi Gong Party in Beijing issued a statement protesting against the Thai government's persecution of overseas Chinese. The statement said:

    The Luang Phibunsongkhram clique puppet government of Thailand, since its return to power under the protection of American and British imperialism, has continued its anti-China policy from the time it was under the wing of Japanese fascism. First, it closed down progressive schools for overseas Chinese, depriving 200,000 children of their education; then, it sealed up democratic newspapers of overseas Chinese, depriving overseas Chinese of their freedom of speech; then, it used the so-called "Occupational Reservation Act" to devastate the industry and commerce of overseas Chinese, cutting off the livelihood of hundreds of thousands of overseas Chinese; moreover, it used the "Expulsion of Overseas Chinese Act" to persecute the physical freedom of our overseas Chinese compatriots, and this has become increasingly intense; recently, it has even dared to arrest overseas Chinese in large numbers and imprison them, and inflict inhuman torture, resulting in the deaths of many. This series of crimes is truly intolerable to the people of our country. The serious protest lodged by Vice Minister Li of our Ministry of Foreign Affairs to the Thai government on January 27th is entirely in line with the demands of all the people of China. In addition to firmly supporting Vice Minister Li's statement, our party vows to do everything in its power to assist the overseas Chinese in distress in regaining their legitimate rights, and will not stop until this goal is achieved.

　　致公党驻京发言人声明
    抗议泰政府迫害侨胞       
    誓竭全力协助受难侨胞争回权益
    【北京讯】中国致公党驻京发言人发表声明抗议泰国政府迫害我侨胞，该称明声：
    泰国銮披汶集团傀儡政府，自从在美英帝国主义的庇护下重新登台后，即又继续了它在日本法西斯卵翼时的排华政策。首先关闭华侨进步的学校，致二十万儿童失学；继之，查封华侨的民主报纸，剥夺华侨的言论自由；又复以所谓“职业保留条例”摧残华侨的工商业，使数十万侨胞生机断绝；更用“驱逐华侨出境条例”迫害我侨胞的身体自由，而且愈演愈烈；近日竟敢大批逮捕侨胞入狱，并施以惨无人道的殴辱，以至死亡多人。这一连串的罪行，实我全国人民所不能容许的，我外交部李副部长于一月二十七日向泰国政府提出的严重抗议，是完全符合我全中国人民的要求的。本党除坚决拥护李副外长的声明外，誓罄全力协助当受难侨胞，争回正当权益，非达到目的不止。
