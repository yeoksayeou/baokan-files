Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, February 9th: The following is a summary of the report by East China Military and Political Committee member Shu Tong on the cultural and educational work in East China at the first meeting of the East China Military and Political Committee:

　　(1) The East China region is a relatively developed area in culture and education with a fine revolutionary tradition. At the same time, it is also a solid stronghold of imperialist cultural aggression for more than a hundred years and the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang for more than twenty years. Since our army liberated the vast areas of Jiangnan last year, we have universally launched ideological struggles on the cultural propaganda front, rapidly destroyed the enemy's ideological positions, occupied and expanded our own ideological positions, taken over or stopped reactionary cultural propaganda organs and their various activities, established revolutionary political banners, and expanded the political influence of people's democracy. The East China Propaganda and Education Work Conference held last August emphasized propaganda and education against imperialism and feudalism, especially focusing on the six major tasks of breaking the enemy's blockade to carry out propaganda work. After the successive occurrences of the "Amethyst Incident," the "North China Daily News Incident," and the "Olyphant Incident," we forcefully exposed the imperialist conspiracy and raised the people's political vigilance. After the "July 7th" parade and demonstrations and several mass movements after mid-September, the people's understanding of internationalism and new patriotism was raised a step further, and good influence was exerted on the ideological education of consolidating and developing the friendship between the people of China and the Soviet Union, and supporting the world peace camp against the aggression camp. In rural areas, the popularization of new cultural education was carried out in coordination with the specific steps of anti-feudal struggles such as suppressing bandits and local tyrants, reasonable burden, and rent reduction.

　　(2) Building new education for the people of East China is a long-term struggle. We should continue to restore and improve public and private schools in the new areas, improve the quality of teaching, unite and transform old teachers; while in the old areas, we should consolidate and improve on the existing basis, and prepare the necessary and possible conditions for development. We have taken over a total of 52 colleges and universities, about 500 secondary schools, and about 67,000 primary schools. The schools taken over have all undergone planned and step-by-step transformation. Now, there are more than 78,000 public and private schools of all levels in the region, with a total of 6,225,000 students and about 220,000 faculty and staff. Except for Shandong and northern Jiangsu, most of the regions are new areas, so continuing to improve public and private schools is still an important task at present. We should continue to transform old teachers and train new teachers. At the same time, we should strengthen secondary education and higher specialized education, pay attention to technical education and production education, so as to cultivate a large number of management talents and technical talents, and promote worker-peasant social education and eliminate illiteracy in a planned and step-by-step manner. Social education in old areas such as Shandong and northern Jiangsu has a good foundation. Workers' education in the new areas is also developing rapidly. In military and political organs where the environment is relatively stable and there are no combat missions, the education of on-the-job cadres should be strengthened. In addition, it is necessary to strengthen and expand the East China People's Revolutionary University to educate a large number of educated youth and train a large number of worker-peasant cadres to meet the needs of revolutionary work and national construction. Last year, revolutionary universities in various places trained more than 30,000 young college students, and various military and political schools trained about 40,000 people, and assigned them to participate in revolutionary work. This year, we must strengthen our efforts to train revolutionary educated youth to participate in land reform and rural cultural and educational work.

　　(3) In the fields of literature, science, and art, we must promote the idea that literature, science, and art serve the people, and at the same time, we must strengthen the leadership of news and publishing work. Since the liberation of Shanghai, a new united force has been formed in the cultural circles. The members of the United Association of Faculty and Staff of Colleges and Universities have reached 12,000, the members of the Association for Science and Technology have reached more than 10,000, the members of various associations in the literary and art circles have reached 5,373, and the journalists under the News Association are about 3,000. There have also been some achievements in reforming old dramas and creating new scripts and songs. The people's drama and film industry has also begun to sprout. However, the entire cultural, scientific, and artistic activities have not yet established closer ties with the broad masses, and the tendency of closed-doorism has not yet been completely overcome. We must organize literary and artistic creation in a planned way, develop the people's film and drama industry, and at the same time promote social sciences and natural sciences and reward outstanding scientific works and inventions. State news and publishing organs such as public newspapers, news agencies, radio stations, and Xinhua bookstores in East China have been gradually unified and concentrated, and the quality has been greatly improved, and the connection with the masses has gradually strengthened after half a year of rectification, simplification, and transformation. However, there are still many shortcomings, such as the content is not practical enough, the connection with the masses is not extensive and profound enough, the methods are not diverse enough, and more help and guidance have not been given to private cultural undertakings. These shortcomings need our further efforts to overcome.

　　(4) According to Chairman Mao's instructions, our national culture and national education are new-democratic, that is, to establish a new culture and new education of our own nation, scientific, and for the people. We should absorb progressive foreign culture, especially the advanced socialist Soviet culture, as a mirror for China's cultural construction. We must train a large number of Russian translators in order to introduce the Soviet Union's experience and achievements in various aspects of construction, so as to exchange culture between China and the Soviet Union, and consolidate the friendship and unity between the people of China and the Soviet Union.

　　舒同委员在华东军政委员会会议上
    关于华东文化教育工作情况报告摘要
    【新华社上海九日电】华东军政委员会委员舒同在华东军政委员会第一次会议上关于华东文化教育工作情况的报告摘要如下：
    （一）华东地区是文化教育较为发达并有着革命优良传统的地区，但同时它又是帝国主义百余年来文化侵略和国民党二十多年来反动统治的坚固堡垒。去年我军解放江南广大地区以来，我们即以普遍展开文化宣传战线上的思想斗争，迅速摧毁敌人的思想阵地，占领与扩大自己的思想阵地，接管或停止反动的文化宣传机关及其各种活动，树立革命的政治旗帜和扩大人民民主的政治影响。去年八月召开的华东宣传教育工作会议曾经强调反对帝国主义、反对封建主义的宣传教育，特别以粉碎敌人封锁的六大任务为中心，进行宣传工作。在“紫石英号事件”、“字林西报事件”、“欧立夫事件”连续发生之后，我们曾经有力地揭穿了帝国主义的阴谋，提高了人民的政治警觉。在“七七”游行示威以及九月中旬以后的几次群众运动以后，人民群众在国际主义和新爱国主义的认识上都提高了一步，对巩固与发展中苏两国人民的友谊，拥护世界和平阵线反对侵略阵营的思想教育，也发生了良好的影响。在农村则配合剿匪反恶霸、合理负担、减租等反封建斗争的具体步骤而进行新文化教育的普及工作。
    （二）建设华东人民的新教育是一个长期奋斗的过程。我们应当在新区继续恢复与改进公私立学校，提高教学质量，团结和改造旧教师；而在老区则应在现有基础上加以巩固和提高，并准备必要与可能的发展条件。我们共接管专科以上学校五十二所，中等学校约五百所，小学约六万七千所，接管的学校都进行了有计划有步骤的改造工作。现在全区共有公私立大中小学七万八千余所，学生总计六百二十二万五千人，教职员约二十二万人。除山东、苏北外，大部分是新区，所以继续改进公私立学校，仍为目前一项重要任务。应该继续进行改造旧教师和培养新师资的工作。同时加强中等教育和高等专门教育，注意技术教育与生产教育，以培养大量的管理人才和技术人才，并有计划有步骤地推广工农社会教育与开展扫除文盲的工作。老区如山东、苏北的社会教育，都有较好的基础。新区的职工教育，也在迅速开展。在环境比较安定和没有作战任务的军政机关，应加强在职干部的教育。此外还必须加强与扩大华东人民革命大学，以教育大批知识青年，并培养大批工农干部以应革命工作和国家建设的需要。去年各地革命大学总共训练了青年大学生三万余人，各种军政学校训练了约四万人，并分配参加革命工作。我们今年更要加强努力，培养革命知识青年，参加土地改革和乡村文化教育工作。
    （三）在文学、科学、艺术领域中，我们必须提倡文学科学艺术为人民服务的思想，同时必须加强对新闻出版工作的领导。上海解放以来，文化界已形成新的团结力量。大中小学教职员联合会的会员已有一万二千人，科学技术协会的会员已有万余人，文艺界各种协会的会员已有五千三百七十三人，新闻协会团结下的新闻工作者约三千余人。其他在改革旧剧，创作新剧本、新歌曲等各方面都有了一些成绩。人民的戏剧电影事业，也开始萌芽。但整个文化科学艺术活动，还没有与广大群众建立更密切的联系，关门主义的倾向仍未被完全克服。我们必须有计划地组织文艺创作，发展人民电影戏剧事业，同时提倡社会科学与自然科学和奖励优秀的科学著作与发明。华东区公营报纸、通讯社、广播电台和新华书店等国家新闻出版机关，经过半年来的整理、精简和改造，已逐渐统一集中，质量有了很大的提高，与群众的联系逐渐加强。但仍有不少缺点，如内容还不够切实，联系群众不够广泛深刻，方式和方法不够多样，对私营文化事业未能予以更多的帮助和指导等。这些缺点都需要我们进一步努力去克服。
    （四）根据毛主席的指示，我们的国民文化和国民教育，是新民主主义的，即是建立自己民族的、科学的、人民大众的新文化与新教育。我们应吸收进步的外国文化，特别是吸收先进的社会主义的苏联文化，以为中国文化建设的借镜。我们要培养大批俄文翻译工作人员，以便介绍苏联各方面的建设经验和成就，以交流中苏两国文化，巩固中苏两国人民的友谊和团结。
