To Mr. Xu Xiuqing of Pingjiang, Hunan:

　　The "Freestyle" Oil Press produced by Tianjin Huabei New Agricultural Implement Factory can be used to extract camellia oil. The camellia seeds do not need to be ground or heated. On average, it can process 70 catties of raw material (camellia seeds) per hour, yielding 16 to 18 catties of camellia oil. This is a 10% increase in production compared to the old-fashioned oil pressing methods.

　　The machine can be powered by electricity, water, or animal power (approximately six head of cattle). Each machine weighs 380 pounds and has a volume of 90cm × 45cm × 75cm. The price per machine is 1,200 "real value units" in both Tianjin and Shanghai (excluding motor belts and other spare parts). The "spiral cylinder" inside the machine needs to be replaced approximately every three months, with each cylinder costing 55 "real value units". If animal power is used to turn the machine, an additional set of equipment is required. This equipment is sold by the Huabei New Agricultural Implement Factory for 1,000 "real value units" per set. If you wish to manufacture it yourself, the factory can provide manufacturing drawings free of charge.

　　The Huabei New Agricultural Implement Factory is located at 13 Songjiang Road, Tianjin, and has management offices in Shanghai, Changsha, and other places.

　　“自由式”榨油机湖南平江徐秀青先生：
    天津华北新农具制造厂出品——“自由式”榨油机，是可以榨取茶子油的。茶子不必磨碎或加热。平均每小时榨原料（茶子）七十斤，得茶油十六斤至十八斤。比旧式榨油法增产百分之十。
    该机动力可使用电力、水力或畜力（约六头牛），机器每部重３８０磅，体积是９０cm×４５cm×７５cm。每部价格，在天津、上海都是一千二百个折实单位（马达皮带及其他备件不在内）。机器中的“螺旋筒”大约三个月须换一只，每只单价合五十五个折实单位。如用畜力转动该机，则须添置一套装备。这种装备，华北新农具制造厂每套售价合一千折实单位；如欲自己制造，该厂可提供制造图样，不要代价。
    华北新农具制造厂在天津松江路十三号，上海、长沙等地有经理处。
