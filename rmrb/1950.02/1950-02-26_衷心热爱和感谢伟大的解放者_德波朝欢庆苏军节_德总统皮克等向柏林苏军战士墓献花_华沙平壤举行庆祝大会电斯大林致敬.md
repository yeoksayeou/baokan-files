Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, February 25th: The peoples of Germany, Poland, and Korea, liberated by the great victory of the Soviet Red Army, warmly celebrated the 32nd anniversary of the founding of the Soviet Army. According to TASS, Berlin: President Pieck of the German Democratic Republic, the government of the German Democratic Republic, the Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, and representatives of the democratic public of Berlin laid wreaths at the Tomb of Soviet Soldiers in Berlin on the 23rd.

President Pieck sent a letter to General Chuikov, Chairman of the Soviet Control Commission in Germany, congratulating him on Soviet Army Day, stating: "This anniversary is a day for every progressive person to joyfully reaffirm that the just cause of peace and democracy will surely triumph over the forces of destruction and reaction. The German people, liberated by the strength of the Soviet Army, are convinced that the army of socialist Soviet Union is different from the army of imperialism, but full of the spirit of peace and international friendship. The Soviet Army respects the German nation's right to self-determination, loves and respects the German working people, and maintains and consolidates the peaceful aspirations between the peoples of the Soviet Union and the German people—these qualities of the Soviet Army enable the German people to establish the German Democratic Republic in their self-defensive struggle against the oppressive policies of international reactionaries."

Amidst continuous applause, all attendees passed a congratulatory telegram to Marshal Stalin. The telegram stated in brief: "For those imperialist aggressors, the coveters of world hegemony, the Soviet Army is an insurmountable obstacle. The 32-year history of the Soviet Army is a history of unprecedented mass heroism and selfless sacrifice. Under your leadership, under the ideological guidance of the glorious Bolshevik Party, the Soviet Armed Forces have completed a victorious march. The victory of the Soviet Army has made possible the establishment of the Polish People's regime and the laying of the socialist foundation. The Polish people will forever maintain their love and gratitude for the Soviet Army, forever maintain their friendship with the Soviet people, and the comradely friendship between the Polish Army and the armed forces of the Soviet state."
