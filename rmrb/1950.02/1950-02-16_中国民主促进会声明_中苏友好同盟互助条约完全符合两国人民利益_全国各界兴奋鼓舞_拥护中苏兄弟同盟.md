China Democratic Promotion Association Statement
    The Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance Fully Conforms to the Interests of the People of Both Countries
    People from All Walks of Life Across the Country are Excited, Encouraged, and Support the Sino-Soviet Brotherly Alliance
    The China Democratic Promotion Association issued the following statement on the conclusion of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance:
    The governments of China and the Soviet Union announced in Moscow on February 14, 1950, the conclusion of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance, and simultaneously signed agreements on the Chinese Changchun Railway, Lushunkou, and Dalian, and an agreement on the Soviet government granting the government of the People's Republic of China long-term economic loans as repayment for the purchase of industrial and railway machinery and equipment from the Soviet Union. The conclusion of these treaties and agreements conforms to the fundamental interests of the people of China and the Soviet Union and will become a symbol of the brotherly friendship and eternal cooperation between the two countries, especially demonstrating the Soviet people's enthusiastic assistance to the Chinese people's revolutionary cause under the policy guidance of Marshal Stalin. We fully express our support.
    The Soviet government and the Soviet people have always been the closest friends of the Chinese people. Since the October Socialist Revolution, the great friendship between the two countries has been established. However, due to the deliberate instigation and malicious propaganda of the imperialist bloc and the domestic Kuomintang reactionaries, some people were somewhat deceived and harbored a degree of distrust towards the Soviet Union, especially manifested in the Lushun-Dalian issue. Now this truly great friendship has been solidified in the treaty, and we believe that the people of the whole country will see more clearly the great friendship of the Soviet Union towards the Chinese people. The agreement on the Chinese Changchun Railway and Lushun clearly stipulates that the Soviet Union will unconditionally transfer all rights and all property belonging to the Chinese Changchun Railway, and Soviet troops will withdraw from the Lushunkou naval base. The shameless attempts of domestic and foreign reactionaries have been completely bankrupt.
    More importantly, the conclusion of these treaties and agreements further guarantees lasting peace in the Far East and even the world, not only representing the interests of the people of China and the Soviet Union, but also representing the interests of the people of the East and all peace-loving and just people in the world. We believe that progressive mankind all over the world will support our treaties and agreements.
    Due to the conclusion of these treaties and agreements, the friendly cooperation between China and the Soviet Union has entered a new era, and a strong and industrialized new China will be built more rapidly with the help of the Soviet Union. Let us shout: Long live Marshal Stalin, the leader of progressive mankind all over the world, and Chairman Mao, the leader of the Chinese people!

　　中国民主促进会声明
    中苏友好同盟互助条约完全符合两国人民利益
    全国各界兴奋鼓舞  拥护中苏兄弟同盟
    中国民主促进会就中苏缔结友好同盟互助条约发表声明如下：
    中苏二国政府于一九五○年二月十四日在莫斯科发表公告：缔结中苏友好同盟互助条约，同时签订了关于中国长春铁路、旅顺口及大连的协定，关于苏联政府给予中华人民共和国政府以长期经济贷款作为偿付自苏联购买工业与铁路的机器设备的协定。这些条约和协定的缔结是符合了中苏二国人民的根本利益，并将成为中苏二国兄弟友谊和永远合作的标志，特别表现了在斯大林大元帅政策指导之下的苏联人民，热情地援助中国人民的革命事业，我们完全表示拥护。
    苏联政府和苏联人民一直是中国人民的最亲密的朋友。从十月社会主义革命以来，二国的伟大友谊就已经建立起来了，但是其间曾由于帝国主义集团和国内国民党反动派有意的挑拨，恶意的宣传，有一些人多少受到了一些蒙蔽，而对苏联怀着某种程度的不信任的态度，其中特别表现在旅大问题上。现在这种真正伟大的友谊，已经在条约上固定下来了，我们相信全国人民由此将更清楚地看到苏联对中国人民的伟大友谊。在关于中国长春铁路和旅大的协定中明确地规定着：苏联将要无偿地移交中国长春铁路的一切权利以及属于该路的全部财产，苏联军队将要自旅顺口海军根据地撤退。国内外的反动派无耻的企图已经彻底的破产了。
    更重要的，这些条约和协定的缔结，更加保证了远东乃至世界的持久和平，不但代表了中苏两国人民的利益，同时也是代表了东方和世界上一切爱好和平与正义人民的利益。我们相信全世界进步人类都会拥护我们的条约和协定的。
    由于这些条约和协定的缔结，中苏两国的友好合作已走进一个新的时代，一个强盛和工业化的新中国将要由于加上苏联的援助，更迅速地建设起来。让我们高呼：全世界进步人类的领袖斯大林大元帅和中国人民领袖毛主席万岁！
