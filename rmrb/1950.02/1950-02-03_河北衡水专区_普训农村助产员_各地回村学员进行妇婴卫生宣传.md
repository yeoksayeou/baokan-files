Hebei Hengshui Special District
    Popular Training of Rural Midwives
    Trainees Return to Villages to Conduct Maternal and Infant Health Education

    [Reported by this newspaper] Hebei News: Tongxian, Hengshui, Tianjin Special Districts, and other areas in Hebei Province are widely carrying out rural midwifery education. Since the joint directive on developing maternal and infant health work was issued by the Hebei Provincial Health Department and the Provincial Women's Federation, governments, women's federations, and people's hospitals at all levels in the province have actively implemented it. The Tongxian Special District Women's Federation and the Special Commissioner's Office Health Section jointly trained 27 women cadres from various counties, providing them with midwifery education; the first phase of training in Wanping, Changping, and four other counties involved 127 new and old birth attendants. It is expected that the popular training of birth attendants in various counties of Hengshui Special District will be completed before the Lunar New Year. Jixian County in the special district has already trained 358 people. The Tianjin Special District established a midwifery training class in Shengfang Town, which has already trained 39 in-service county and district women cadres. Other counties, such as Boye and Laiyuan, have also successively opened small-scale midwifery training classes, with a total of 72 trainees.
    The training content mainly focuses on new delivery methods. Tongxian and Tianjin Special Districts use wall charts during lectures to help students remember; Boye and Shenze compared the mortality rates of new and old delivery methods, making the trainees aware of the importance of learning the new methods. Some women recounted the tragic deaths of infants in the past, and the trainees said with emotion, "If we had known the new delivery methods earlier, there wouldn't have been so many heartbreaking events." At the same time, the training also broke down the superstitious and backward ideas of the old midwives and the idea among young women that midwifery was "not decent."
    The new and old birth attendants who have returned to their villages after training are now conducting maternal and infant health education. For example, the birth attendants in Laiyuan are investigating pregnant women who are about to give birth, preparing to use new methods for delivery when the time comes; Xu Xian, a woman from Fangshan, learned the new delivery methods and uses her evenings to call women to her home to talk about maternal and infant health knowledge, which the women love to hear.

　　河北衡水专区
    普训农村助产员
    各地回村学员进行妇婴卫生宣传
    【本报讯】河北消息：河北省通县、衡水、天津专区等地正广泛进行农村助产教育。自河北省卫生厅与省妇联会关于开展妇婴卫生工作的联合指示发出后，该省各级政府、妇联会与人民医院即积极执行。通县专区妇联会和专署卫生科联合训练了各县妇女干部二十七人，给以助产教育；宛平、昌平等六县第一期训练了新、旧接产人员一百二十七人。衡水专区各县接产人员在阴历年前可普训完毕，该专区冀县已训练了三百五十八人。天津专区在胜芳镇成立了助产训练班，已训练在职县、区妇女干部三十九人。其他如博野、涞源两县也先后开办了小型助产训练班，受训的共七十二人。
    训练内容主要是新的接生方法。通县、天津专区讲课时利用挂图以帮助学员记忆；博野、深泽将新旧接生法的伤亡作了对比，使学员认识了学习新接生法的重要。有的妇女诉述了过去婴孩死亡的惨重，学员们感动地说：“早先要会新接生法，那里有这么多伤心事。”同时，训练中也打破了旧接生婆的迷信落后思想和年青妇女认为收生“不体面”的思想。
    现受训回村的新旧助产人员，正进行妇婴卫生宣传。如涞源助产人员正调查快生孩子的妇女，准备到时用新法接生；房山妇女许贤学了新接生法，利用晚上时间把妇女们叫到自己家里，讲妇婴卫生常识，妇女们都很爱听。
