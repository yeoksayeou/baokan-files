　　Peng Zhen's Speech on Behalf of the Trade Union Committee:
    The Current Central Task of the Trade Union is to Restore and Develop Production; Workers Should Send Representatives to Participate in Factory Management
    As a result of the election at the meeting, Peng Zhen, Liu Ren, Xiao Ming, Liu Laifu, Zhang Hongshun, Yang Yunyu, and 57 others were elected as members, Liu Fugui and 9 others were elected as alternate members, Yang Baosong and 8 others were elected as supervisory committee members, and Xing Yuru and 1 other were elected as alternate supervisory committee members. The members then mutually elected Peng Zhen as Chairman, Liu Ren as First Vice-Chairman, Xiao Ming as Second Vice-Chairman, Liu Laifu as Third Vice-Chairman, and Zhang Hongshun as Fourth Vice-Chairman. The Beijing Federation of Trade Unions was formally established. The trade unions of the Beijing Electric Power Bureau and the Dahua Pottery Company presented flowers and gifts to the new Municipal Federation of Trade Unions Committee, and everyone applauded and cheered in celebration.
    Following this, Comrade Peng Zhen, on behalf of the trade union committee members, emphatically clarified the spirit of this conference, saying: The first central task of the trade union currently is production, the second is production, and the third is still production. Our current central task is to restore and develop production, so that Beijing can take a big step forward towards the goal of becoming a production city. He explained that the ultimate goal of the revolution is to liberate productive forces and develop production. Only when production develops can China be industrialized, the Chinese economy prosper, workers' lives be improved, unemployment problems be solved, cultural undertakings be developed, and municipal construction have a foundation. Developing production is our current overriding central task. He then pointed out that democratic management must be earnestly implemented in state-owned factories; production plans must be set and production must be carried out according to plan; workers should elect representatives to actively participate in factory management and in the formulation of production plans; collective contracts must be signed, with the trade union representing the workers in signing contracts with the factory administration; production competitions should be launched in accordance with production plans and contracts, and production competitions should be launched to increase output, improve quality, and reduce costs, so as to improve production and strive for production to grow by an inch, two inches, the more the better. Regarding the work of private factories, Comrade Peng Zhen pointed out that in private factories that manufacture means of production and daily necessities, production competition movements should be launched with certain conditions. In private factories that launch production competitions, workers should elect representatives to participate in factory management. Workers should have the right to be involved in the success or failure of the operation, the profits and losses of the business, and whether the employment of personnel is appropriate. Wages should be paid according to labor, and an appropriate progressive piece-rate system should be implemented based on the principle of mutual benefit for labor and capital. Finally, he emphasized that regardless of whether it is in a state-owned factory or a private factory, the content of production competition should focus on increasing output, improving quality, and reducing costs in all three aspects. In order to ensure the smooth restoration and development of production, it is necessary to prevent sabotage by special agents, protect the safety of factories, and prevent destructive events such as those at the streetcar repair factory from happening again. In addition, our trade union has many other tasks, but these tasks should all be for production, subordinate to production, and carried out around the central task of production!
    Following this, conference representatives Xiao Bo, Liu Zhiping, Tian Lun, Wang Yongwen, Wang Shixiu, and others spoke, expressing their determination to convey the spirit, resolutions, and process of the conference to every worker and to implement them, ensuring the completion of the 1950 production plan and launching a production competition movement to increase output, improve quality, and reduce costs. Ling Bi'ying, a veteran worker of the China People's Printing Factory from the "February 7th" strike, said that in 1923, our Jinghan Railway workers established the General Trade Union under the guns of the Northern Warlords. At that time, we were not able to eat our fill or dress warmly as we produced for the warlords. Now we are producing for ourselves. We have come through struggles under guns, and now we must struggle in production. If we want to improve our lives, we can only rely on our own hands to step up production, improve our culture, improve our skills, and strive to become labor heroes. At this point, the conference successfully concluded in slogans and songs.

    工会当前中心任务是恢复与发展生产  工人要派代表参加工厂管理

    接着，彭真同志代表工会委员着重地阐明了这次大会的精神，他说：工会当前的中心任务第一是生产，第二是生产，第三还是生产。我们当前的中心任务是恢复与发展生产，使北京市向着生产城市的目标，大大前进一步。他说明革命的终极目的是为了解放生产力，发展生产，只有生产发展，才能使中国工业化，中国经济繁荣，工人生活才能获得改善，失业问题才能解决，文化事业才能发展，市政建设才有基础，发展生产，是我们目前压倒一切的中心任务。接着他指出在公营工厂中必须切实实行民主管理；必须定好生产计划，按计划生产；工人应选派代表积极参加工厂管理，和制定生产计划；必须订立集体合同，由工会代表工人与工厂行政订立合同；按照生产计划和合同开展生产竞赛，开展增加产量、提高质量、减低成本的生产竞赛，把生产搞好，争取生产长一寸、长两寸、长得越多越好。对于私营工厂的工作，彭真同志指出：在制造生产资料和日用必需品的私营工厂中，应该有条件的展开生产竞赛运动，凡是开展生产竞赛的私营工厂，工人应选派代表参加工厂管理。经营的好坏、营业的赔赚、用人是否恰当，工人应该有权过问，工资应该是按劳取酬，并根据劳资两利的原则，实行适当的超额累进制。最后，他强调指出无论在公营工厂或私营工厂中，生产竞赛的内容，都应该注意增加产量、提高质量和减低成本三个方面。为了保障生产的顺利恢复与发展，必须防止特务的破坏，要保护工厂的安全，不要再有电车修造厂一类的破坏事件发生。此外，我们工会还有很多工作，但这些工作都应该是为了生产，服从于生产，围绕着生产的中心任务而进行！
