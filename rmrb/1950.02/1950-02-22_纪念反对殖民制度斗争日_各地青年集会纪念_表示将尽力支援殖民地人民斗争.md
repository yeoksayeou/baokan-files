Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, February 21st: Youth from all walks of life in Shenyang, Jinan, Qingdao, and other places enthusiastically commemorated "The Day of Struggle Against Colonialism" yesterday and today.

    Shenyang
    Yesterday, over a thousand youth representatives from the entire city of Shenyang held a commemorative evening. Liu Binyan of the Preparatory Committee of the Northeast Youth League reported on the historical origin of "The Day of Struggle Against Colonialism" and introduced the miserable lives of young people in colonial countries, who account for more than half of the world's population, and the growing national liberation movement in the colonies. He particularly pointed out that, encouraged by the growth of the peace and democracy camp led by the Soviet Union and the success of the Chinese revolution, young people in colonial countries are now more full of confidence in victory and are fighting for independence and liberation. At the meeting, representatives of overseas Chinese students who recently returned from Thailand, the Philippines, Singapore, and other places also spoke, giving concrete and vivid reports on the disasters that imperialism has inflicted on the people of colonial countries and the heroic and unyielding struggles of young people in colonial countries. Worker, student, shop assistant, and staff youth representatives also successively painfully recounted their experiences of living under the 14 years of colonial rule under Japanese寇 (a derogatory term for Japanese invaders), and unanimously expressed that they would never forget that the people and youth of colonial countries are being enslaved and oppressed, and will do everything in their power to support their heroic struggles. Today, youth league branches of various organs and schools in Shenyang also held seminars or commemorative meetings, absorbing non-league youth to participate in the study and discussion of the anti-imperialist struggle of young people in colonial countries, and wrote letters to the young people of various colonial countries who are fighting, encouraging them to continue to advance bravely.

    Jinan
    Youth from all walks of life in Jinan City also enthusiastically commemorated "The Day of Struggle Against Colonialism" today. Factories and schools held seminars to discuss the crimes of imperialism and the colonial system. This afternoon, over a thousand youth representatives from all walks of life in the city held a commemorative meeting. At the meeting, student representative Wang Zumo called on everyone to strengthen the study of New Democracy and cooperate with the national victory to support the national liberation movement of the people of Southeast Asia. Worker representative Gao Dengluan said: "In the past, under the rule of the Japanese寇 and the American Chiang, we lived a dark and gloomy life like the people of the colonies. Today, we are liberated, and we should first thank Chairman Mao for his wise leadership. We must warmly support the recently signed Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance." A women's representative said: "Women suffered the most under the trampling of the Japanese寇 and the American Chiang. We must resolutely oppose the United States supporting Japan's resurgence for aggression. We must not forget the ten million overseas Chinese who are still being rejected and mistreated by imperialism in Vietnam, Malaya, the Philippines, Rome, and Australia. We must vigorously support them and call on them to form a united front with the local people against imperialism." In a letter to the youth of colonial countries, the youth of Jinan City said: "We, the youth of Jinan, pay our highest respect to your unyielding struggle. We firmly believe that your just struggle will quickly achieve the same victory as China. Encouraged by the victory of the peace and democracy forces led by the Soviet Union, we will move forward together."

    Qingdao
    The Qingdao Youth Federation, the Student Federation, Shandong University, and various winter vacation schools, Youth League members and working cadres, etc., held a seminar tonight at the Qingdao Municipal Committee Auditorium of the Youth League to discuss the process of Chinese youth's victory in the long-term struggle and the future tasks of Qingdao youth.

Today, Qingdao Daily published relevant documents on the Day of Struggle Against Colonialism in a special issue.
