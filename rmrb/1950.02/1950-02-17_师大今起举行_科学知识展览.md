　　Normal University to Hold Science Knowledge Exhibition Starting Today

　　[Our Newspaper] The Science Knowledge Exhibition, jointly organized by the Science Popularization Bureau and more than thirty other units, will use the Spring Festival to introduce general daily scientific knowledge to the city's workers, peasants, and the general public. The content is divided into three parts: maternal and child health, from ape to man, and general scientific knowledge. Questionnaires, models, and other means will be used to illustrate the sacrifices of mothers and infants caused by neglecting hygiene, and how to pay attention to nutrition and hygiene implementation. Charts, specimens, and other means will be used to point out how human ancestors evolved into the civilized world through labor. The last part introduces ordinary basic knowledge in biology, chemistry, physics, geography, and psychology. The exhibition will run for a total of ten days, from the 17th to the 26th of this month. The venue is located at the Men's Affiliated Middle School of the Normal University.
