　　Real Estate Tax Payment - Six-Day Suspension for Spring Festival
    [Beijing News] Since Beijing began collecting real estate tax on the 18th of last month, property owners have been enthusiastically paying their taxes. As of the 11th of this month, 44,612 households have paid, accounting for over 87% of the total number of taxpayers. The tax revenue deposited into the treasury is nearly three-quarters of the total, amounting to 6,704,542,928 yuan. Furthermore, the Beijing Municipal Finance Bureau has decided to suspend the collection of real estate tax for six days, from today (the 16th, Lunar New Year's Eve) to the 21st (the fifth day of the Lunar New Year), to accommodate the holiday customs of the general public. These six days will not be counted as late payment period. All collection points will resume collection as usual from February 22nd (the sixth day of the Lunar New Year).
