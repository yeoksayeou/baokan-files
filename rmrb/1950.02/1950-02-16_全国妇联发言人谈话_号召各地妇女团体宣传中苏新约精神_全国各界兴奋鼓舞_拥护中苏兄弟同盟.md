Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, February 15th: A spokesperson for the All-China Democratic Women's Federation issued the following statement in celebration and support of the signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance and the other two agreements between China and the Soviet Union:

	We Chinese women, along with the Chinese people, excitedly cheer and warmly celebrate the signing of The Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance, the Sino-Soviet Agreement on the Chinese Changchun Railway, Port Arthur, and Dalian, and the Sino-Soviet Agreement on a Loan to China. This is a great success in Sino-Soviet diplomacy, and a symbol of Sino-Soviet brotherly friendship and permanent cooperation.

	The treaties and agreements between China and the Soviet Union are an alliance against aggression and for the defense of peace, and are clauses for the development of economic and cultural mutual assistance and cooperation between the two countries in accordance with the principles of equality, mutual benefit, and mutual respect for national sovereignty and territorial integrity. The signing of these treaties and agreements indicates that the relationship between China and the Soviet Union has entered a new era; it indicates that the friendly cooperation between the two peoples will be further consolidated and developed as a result; at the same time, it severely strikes at the US imperialist conspiracy to provoke discord between China and the Soviet Union, and greatly strikes at the US imperialist aggressive plans and war policies to undermine peace in the Far East and even world peace, playing a great role in safeguarding lasting peace in the East and the world, and universal security for mankind.

	Chinese women and children resolutely oppose aggression and love peace, and will never forget the profound trauma inflicted by the rule of Japanese imperialism and the Kuomintang reactionaries in the past. We warmly support these treaties and agreements between China and the Soviet Union, because they safeguard the fundamental interests of Chinese women and children. They provide full guarantees for us to stop aggression, build a new China, and for a better and happier future.

	We call on democratic women's federations and democratic women's groups in various regions, and sisters across the country, to widely and deeply publicize the significance of Sino-Soviet friendly cooperation, as well as the spirit and specific content of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance and the other two agreements, and to use this as one of the propaganda centers for this year's "March 8th" International Working Women's Day, to more actively mobilize women to support the world peace and democracy camp headed by the Soviet Union, and to more actively support the People's Liberation War, participate in land reform work and various construction works in the new China, and celebrate the conclusion of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance and the other two agreements with this practical action.

	Finally, we shout:

	① Long live the permanent friendship and permanent cooperation between China and the Soviet Union!

	② Long live Mao Zedong, the leader of the Chinese people!

	③ Long live Marshal Stalin, the teacher of mankind throughout the world!

　　全国妇联发言人谈话  号召各地妇女团体宣传中苏新约精神     
    全国各界兴奋鼓舞  拥护中苏兄弟同盟
    【新华社北京十五日电】中华全国民主妇女联合会发言人为庆祝与拥护中苏友好同盟互助条约及中苏两国的其他两个协定的签订发表谈话如下：
    我们中国妇女和中国人民一起兴奋地欢呼、热烈地庆祝中苏友好同盟互助条约，中苏关于中国长春铁路、旅顺口及大连的协定，中苏关于贷款给中国的协定的签订。这是中苏两国外交上的伟大成功，这是中苏兄弟友谊与永久合作的标志。
    中苏两国的条约和协定，是反对侵略保卫和平的同盟，是遵照平等、互利、互相尊重国家主权和领土完整的原则，发展两国经济与文化的互助合作的条款。这些条约和协定的签订，指明了中苏两国的关系进入了新的时代；指明了两国人民的友好合作将由此而更加巩固与发展；同时，又严重打击了美帝国主义挑拨中苏关系的阴谋，极大地打击了美帝国主义破坏远东和平以至世界和平的侵略计划和战争政策，对于保障东方与世界的持久和平与人类的普遍安全起着伟大的作用。
    中国妇女和中国儿童坚决反对侵略，爱好和平，永远不会忘记过去日本帝国主义及国民党反动派统治所给予的深刻创痛。我们热烈地拥护中苏之间的这些条约和协定，因为它们是保卫中国妇女与中国儿童的根本利益的。它们对于我们为制止侵略、建设新中国以及美好而幸福的将来提供了充分的保证。
    我们号召各地民主妇联及民主妇女团体，全国姊妹，一定要广泛深入地宣传中苏友好合作的意义，以及中苏友好同盟互助条约和其他两个协定的精神与具体内容，并以此作为今年“三八”国际劳动妇女节的宣传中心之一，更加努力地发动妇女拥护以苏联为首的世界和平民主阵营，更加努力地支援人民解放战争，参加土地改革工作及新中国的各种建设工作，以这种实际行动来庆祝中苏友好同盟互助条约及其他两个协定的缔结。
    最后我们高呼：
    ①中苏永久友好与永久合作万岁！
    ②中国人民的领袖毛泽东万岁！
    ③全世界人类导师斯大林大元帅万岁！
