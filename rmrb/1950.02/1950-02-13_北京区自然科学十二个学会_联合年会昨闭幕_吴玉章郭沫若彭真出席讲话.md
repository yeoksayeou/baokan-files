Beijing Area Natural Science Twelve Societies Joint Annual Meeting Concludes
    Wu Yuzhang, Guo Moruo, Peng Zhen Attend and Speak

    [This newspaper reports] The joint annual meeting of the twelve natural science societies in the Beijing area (namely the Mathematical Society, the Physical Society, the Chemical Society, the Zoological Society, the Botanical Society, the Physiological Society, the Psychological Society, the Entomological Society, the Pharmaceutical Society, the Geographical Society, the Geological Society, and the Oceanological and Limnological Society) was held at the Sino-French University on the morning of the 11th. A total of 599 members from various societies attended. Zhu Kezhen delivered the opening speech. Wu Yuzhang, Guo Moruo, and Peng Zhen were invited to give speeches at the meeting. In his speech, Wu Yuzhang clearly stated the important tasks of Chinese science in the future: to serve the economic construction of the new China; and explained that "scientific knowledge should be combined with the workers' construction enthusiasm" to overcome the difficulties in economic construction. He said: "Now we have the workers' construction enthusiasm. We must strengthen our scientific work. The scientific community must unite, organize, and undertake this construction task." In addition, he put forward many specific opinions on scientific research work, hoping that each scientific organization would cooperate with each other to break the isolated state of scientific researchers in the past, so that scientific research work could be carried out in a planned manner. Finally, when analyzing the relationship between science and scientists and politics, Wu Yuzhang hoped that scientists would change their past attitude of not caring about politics. "If science is to serve the people, it must understand and care about politics." He said: "We emphasize that scientists should not only understand natural science, but also understand social science, understand politics, see the times clearly, and stand firm. Therefore, every scientist must study Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought. Only in this way can they truly serve the people."
    In his speech, Guo Moruo reported to everyone on the organizational structure and work progress of scientific research in the capital, explaining the good political and material conditions for scientific research today. He said: "Today is the best period for the development of natural science in China, the best time to take root in the soil of China, and the time when the people of the whole country have the highest expectations of scientists." Therefore, Chinese science has extremely broad prospects.
    Peng Zhen's speech emphasized that science should serve the people. Scientific research should be closely integrated with practice. When the war has not finally ended and the enemies have not been completely eliminated, science should serve to overthrow and eliminate the enemies, combine with politics, and combine with the people. At the same time, science should serve to conquer nature, that is, to serve production, and be integrated with production. Comrade Peng Zhen pointed out in his speech that Chinese scientists should learn from foreign advanced science, especially from the Soviet Union, but more importantly, they should develop their own creativity, stand on their own feet, and become Chinese creative scientists, and hope that the Chinese scientific community will strengthen unity, break all boundaries and factions, and work together to develop Chinese science.
    On the afternoon of the 12th, the second day of the conference was held, discussing proposals and passing the "Articles of Association of Natural Science Societies" and the "Resolution of the Joint Annual Meeting of the Twelve Natural Science Societies in the Beijing Area." After the conference, a dinner was held.

　　北京区自然科学十二个学会
    联合年会昨闭幕       
    吴玉章郭沫若彭真出席讲话
    【本报讯】北京区自然科学十二学会（即数学会、物理学会、化学会、动物学会、植物学会、生理学会、心理学会、昆虫学会、药学会、地学会、地质学会、海洋湖沼学会）联合年会十一日上午在中法大学举行。各学会到会会员共五百九十九人。竺可桢致开会辞。会上请吴玉章、郭沫若、彭真作演讲。吴玉章在演讲中明确说明今后中国科学的重要任务：为新中国的经济建设服务；说明“科学知识要与工人的建设热忱结合起来”，以战胜经济建设上的困难。他说：“现在我们已有了工人的建设热忱。我们要加强我们的科学工作。科学界要团结起来，组织起来，担负这个建设任务。”此外，他并对科学的研究工作提出了许多具体的意见，希望每个科学团体互相配合工作，打破过去科学研究者的各个孤立的状态，使科学的研究工作能够有计划地进行。最后，吴玉章在分析科学与科学工作者对政治的关系时，希望科学工作者改变过去不关心政治的态度。“科学要为人民服务，就要认识和关心政治”。他说：“我们强调科学家不仅仅要认识自然科学，还要认识社会科学，认识政治，看清时代，站稳立场。所以每一个科学家都要学习马列主义和毛泽东思想。这样，才能真正为人民服务。”
    郭沫若在演讲中向大家报告现在首都科学研究的组织机构与工作进行的情况，说明今天科学研究工作的良好政治条件与物质条件。他说：“今日是中国自然科学界最好发展的一个时期，是在中国的土壤上生根的最好时机，也是全国人民向科学家期望最高的时候。”因此，中国科学有着极其远大的前途。
    彭真的演讲，强调科学要为人民服务。科学研究要与实践密切结合起来。在战争尚未最后结束，敌人尚未全部消灭的时候，科学应为打倒与消灭敌人服务，与政治结合，与人民结合。同时，科学应为征服自然服务即为生产服务，与生产结合起来。彭真同志在演讲中指出中国的科学家要学习外国的进步科学特别是向苏联的学习，但更重要的是发扬自己的创造性，自己站立起来，成为中国的创造的科学家，并希望中国科学界加强团结，打破一切界线与派别，共同为发展中国的科学努力前进。
    十二日下午举行第二天的大会，讨论提案，以及通过“自然科学学会会章”与“北京区自然科学十二学会联合年会决议”。大会结束后，举行聚餐。
