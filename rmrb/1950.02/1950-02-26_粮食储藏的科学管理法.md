　　Scientific Management Methods for Grain Storage
　　Gao Wenbin, Hangzhou Agricultural Improvement Institute, Zhejiang Province

(Editor's Note: Mr. Gao Wenbin's article provides some technical advice on grain storage and management methods. Some of the advice is easy for various regions to implement; some is temporarily difficult to implement, and some even needs further research. However, how to improve grain storage work must attract the attention of all regions. It is hoped that comrades actually engaged in grain storage work in various regions can write about their work experience for various regions to study and learn from, and work together to improve this important work.)

　　To ensure the safety of grain and prevent mold and insect infestation in warehouses across the country, rational storage must be implemented. The main conditions for "rational storage" are suitable temperature and moisture content, and the prevention of insect and mold damage. For example, the occurrence of "rice weevils" (locally known as wheat lice) is greatly related to temperature. If the grain temperature is below 13.1 degrees Celsius and the grain moisture content is below 11.8%, "rice weevils" cannot reproduce. If the grain moisture content is above 14% and the temperature reaches about 30 degrees Celsius, then general warehouse insects will multiply rapidly, which can reduce the weight of the grain and damage the quality in a short period of time. As for mold: mold is most likely to multiply when the grain moisture content is above 16% and the temperature is 25 degrees Celsius. It easily causes food to rot and smell bad. If the temperature is below 20 degrees Celsius and the moisture content is below 13%, mold will not grow. As far as the grain itself is concerned, it should also be stored in a low-temperature place to keep it in a dormant state. If the grain temperature is high and the humidity is high, its respiration and fermentation will be vigorous, which will reduce the nutrients it contains and reduce its nutritional value. From the above situations, if grain is to be stored for a long time without mold, insect infestation, weight loss, and quality change, it must be kept in a dry and cool state. According to the principle of safe food storage, there are two main items for warehouse implementation:

　　1. Build and Repair Rational Warehouses The safety of grain storage is inseparable from rational warehouses and scientific management. If the warehouse is poorly constructed, moisture and heat can easily invade, and pests and molds can easily occur. If the warehouse is not strong, it is also vulnerable to rodent damage. A rational warehouse should be strong and airtight, so that moisture, heat, insects, rodents cannot invade, like a cylindrical steel-concrete warehouse--grain bin, putting grain in it can isolate it from external moisture and heat, and is not affected by the outside world, so that food can be stored for a long time. According to research, sealed storage of fully dried brown rice can avoid insect damage. Even after four years, the germination power is still undiminished. The physical properties of the rice are also unchanged, the nutritional content is not reduced, and the vitamin B in the germ is the same as that of new rice. Wheat with a moisture content of less than 12% can be stored in sealed storage, and the color can still be preserved after two years, there are no insects, and the germination power is also undiminished. Under ventilated storage, even if the warehouse is well-built and well-managed, the safe period is only two years. Therefore, the ideal storage method should be to store fully dried grain in a sealed place in a high, dry and cool place. Therefore, according to the storage principle, building and repairing rational warehouses is the fundamental way to solve the warehousing problem.

　　2. Implement Technical Management With a rational warehouse construction, management is easy. Like the cylindrical warehouse mentioned above, the food can be dry-heated (160 degrees to 180 degrees Fahrenheit) before storage to reduce the moisture content to below 14% and kill pests. After sealed storage, it can be maintained for a long time. However, there are very few such warehouses in our country at present. According to the survey of Sichuan, Hunan, Henan, Hubei, Guangxi and other provinces, the warehouse construction is mainly wooden board warehouses. These wooden warehouses are either independent buildings or built in temples, ancestral halls and civilian houses. Secondly, there are blue brick warehouses, mud warehouses, and rammed earth warehouses. The above-mentioned warehouses mostly lack ceilings and ventilation and airtight devices, making it difficult to prevent insects, rats, birds, moisture, and heat. Although there are a few new-style warehouses in Sichuan and Guangxi, the conditions for sealing, insect-proofing, and rat-proofing are not enough. Under this circumstance, we should pay more attention to management issues. According to the current warehousing situation in our country, the management items that should be paid attention to are described as follows:

　　1. Inspection of grain entering the warehouse: When the grain enters the warehouse, the moisture should be checked with a moisture meter or by hand milling, tooth cracking, etc. If it is not dry, it should be dried in the sun or dried before entering the warehouse. Recently, the mold and loss of public grain storage have been quite large, mainly because the moisture inspection work was not enough during acceptance. Simple inspection methods: ① Manual inspection method - it is dry grain if the hand inserted into the grain pile does not feel cold and wet. It has been heated if the hand feels hot after inserting it. If it is rice, the rice can be placed on the left palm and milled with the right palm. The dry shell is easy to remove. ② Tooth cracking - it is dry if the grain is crispy and cracked when cracked with teeth. Hand milling inspection - the hand milling is made of wood, and the joint surface has grinding teeth. Put the grain into the hand milling and mill it. The dry shell is easy to break and fall off; after milling, blow away the grain shell and check. It is dry if there are few broken grains. In addition to checking the dryness of the grain, attention should also be paid to the amount of pests and impurities.

　　2. Prevention of heat generation in stored grain: The biggest problem with stockpiling grain is that it is easy to generate heat. If the grain generates heat, not only the protein and fat content will be reduced, but also the taste will deteriorate and the smell will be rancid. Preventing the heat generation of grain is what warehouse management personnel should do day and night. The reasons for the heat generation during grain storage are: (1) Excessive moisture; (2) Parasitism of mold; (3) Occurrence of insect pests. Among them, excessive moisture is the main reason. Generally, the grain does not generate heat when the moisture content is below 14%. The first way to prevent heat generation is to reduce the moisture content of the grain. Second, dissipate accumulated heat. Ventilation bamboo baskets should be inserted in the grain pile. The bamboo basket is made of bamboo strips, about one foot high and eight inches to one foot in diameter, cylindrical. One bamboo basket should be set up for every four square feet of grain pile. When stacking sacks, do not stack them too tightly. They should be stacked in eight-bag layers or six-bag layers. If the dryness is poor, four-bag layers can be stacked to facilitate ventilation. If the grain has generated heat, it should be transferred to another warehouse, ventilated, or exposed to the sun immediately. If the heat is generated due to rampant pests, insecticidal work should be carried out.

　　3. Insect pest prevention and control: China has a vast territory and great differences in climate between the north and the south. The distribution of warehouse pests is also different. It can be roughly divided into four regions: South China, Central China, North China, and north of the Great Wall. South China has a warm and humid climate, and food pests are very serious. The main pest for rice storage is the grain borer, which is most serious in Sichuan, Hunan, Jiangxi, and Guangxi. In northwestern Guangxi, rice is mostly stored in ears, and wheat moths are also quite serious. In the provinces of Henan, Hubei, and Anhui in Central China, the main pests of wheat and corn are rice weevils and wheat moths. Flour pests include Tribolium castaneum, Oryzaephilus surinamensis, and flour mites. North China and Northeast China have a dry climate and a short warm and humid period, so warehouse pests are a secondary problem for warehousing. Therefore, South China should carry out warehouse insect control at all times. Central China should pay attention to timely inspection. North China and Northeast China should carry out warehouse insect treatment when necessary. The main methods of pest prevention and control are introduced as follows: (1) Sun drying and winnowing. Sun drying and winnowing are simple and easy methods for preventing and controlling pests in current warehousing in my country. When grain has symptoms such as insect infestation, heat generation, and dampness, it should be dried in the sun on days with strong sunlight. The thickness should not exceed two inches when drying. It should be turned over from time to time. According to research, new wheat with a moisture content of 23.8% is spread flat on a mat that is six feet long and three feet wide, with 18 buckets per mat. After sun drying at an average temperature of 27.3 degrees Celsius for eight hours, the moisture content can be reduced to 12.7%. Because of the sun drying, pests can be killed, moisture can be reduced, and mold damage can be reduced. After drying, use a windmill to winnow to remove impurities and reduce the temperature and humidity of the grain. (2) Fumigation with agents - This method uses certain agents, which are released in the warehouse, to gradually volatilize into gas to fumigate and kill pests in stored grain, and also has the effect of killing rats and sterilizing. This method is usually held in airtight warehouses or containers. If the warehouse cannot be sealed, fumigation tents can be used. There are many kinds of fumigation agents, including chloropicrin, ethylene dichloride, carbon disulfide, and methyl bromide. However, some agents are flammable and some cannot be used alone. The best one is chloropicrin. This drug has strong penetrating power, has a tear-inducing effect, generally does not affect germination power, and has great efficacy. Our country can already produce it by itself. Only one to two pounds are required in a volume of one thousand cubic feet, and the agent can be distributed using the curtain chute method to take effect. According to experience: For grain piles over three feet, ventilation bamboo baskets should also be set up to help it penetrate; the temperature during fumigation should be above 20 degrees Celsius, the fumigation time should be 48 hours, and the warehouse doors and windows should be opened to release the toxic gas after fumigation. After a week, the grain can be taken out. Toxic gas fumigation should be carried out by personnel with fumigation experience. (3) High and low temperature elimination method. High temperature can not only eliminate pests, but also has the effect of drying stored grain. It has no danger and leaves no bad taste. However, the equipment cost is high, which is its disadvantage. Like the rice weevil, it dies in three hours at a high temperature of 54.4 degrees Celsius, and wheat moth larvae and pupae all die in four hours at 48.9 degrees Celsius. Wheat is not harmful to germination power even after eight hours at 150 degrees Fahrenheit. Dry heat sterilization in flour mills is often carried out at 48.9 degrees to 51.7 degrees Celsius for 10 to 12 hours, which can kill all pests in the flour. When carrying out high-temperature elimination, if the temperature is poor, the time should be extended. The second is low-temperature elimination. Like dried fruits, raisins, and dried plums, insect damage can be avoided at -12 degrees to -2.2 degrees Celsius. Rice weevils will stop breeding below 13.1 degrees. Low-temperature elimination can keep the rice cool and prevent pests from breeding. In the northeast and north China, the winter temperature often reaches tens of degrees below zero, and food can be frozen and dried to kill insects. Can reduce moisture content. (4) Powder prevention method is to cover certain powders on the surface of the grain or mix it with it to prevent and control grain storage pests. There are many medicinal powders available now. However, most of them are toxic to humans and can only be used for seed storage. Our folk has already adopted this kind of method. For example, in the Jiangzhe area, some people use plant ash or lime to cover the surface of the rice. Some farmers in Guangxi use lime to mix with corn for storage. Generally, small-scale grain storage by the people can adopt these experiences. Put the dried grain into a porcelain urn or jar, fill it up, and cover the surface with wood ash or lime, about two inches thick, which has the effect of preventing insects and rats. According to the survey: mixing two parts of mung beans with one part of lime can prevent and control mung bean weevils. Mixing 3% DDT with 100 catties of seeds per two can kill various pests during seed storage. Before food enters the warehouse, the warehouse should be thoroughly cleaned, and no old grain is allowed. Then spray with DDT oil emulsion or water-wet DDT liquid at a rate of one gallon per thousand square feet, which has a good effect on preventing warehouse insects.

　　4. Rodent and bird prevention: During food storage, rodent damage is also very serious. Not only do they steal and pollute the grain, but they also damage warehouses and packaging equipment and spread diseases. Prevention and control methods: (1) Poison bait killing: A. Barium carbonate - This agent is white, odorless, slow in nature and inexpensive. After the rat eats it, it escapes from the hole and dies after drinking water. Formulation: one part of barium carbonate, four parts of flour (weight ratio), add appropriate amount of water, make a sticky dough, and sprinkle it in places where rats often go. Or divide the above-made sticky dough into one-inch pieces, immerse it in mutton candle solution, take it out with chopsticks, do not touch it with your hands, it is better to fry it with lard and vegetable oil. (Note that this medicine is also toxic to humans and animals). B. Red squill - Red squill is a perennial bulb, which is a special medicine for killing rats. Dosage: one or two of squill powder, plus four taels and five qian of grain flour, and then add appropriate amount of water to mix and apply, or make squill powder into a paste and apply it on vegetable leaves and melon slices, which can also be effective. (2) Catching with rat traps. The Indian rat trap has a good effect, and it can catch a nest alive every time. In addition, steel clip can also be used. (3) Toxic gas fumigation: A. Sulfur fumigation method. Use one part of sulfur, one part of saltpeter, and appropriate amount of beef tallow. First mix the sulfur and saltpeter evenly, then add beef tallow, make it into a rod shape, about three inches long, light it and put it into the rat hole (be careful not to mix in carbon chips, so as not to turn it into gunpowder). B. Chloropicrin poisoning method. Find a rat hole, use a piece of cotton wool dipped in chloropicrin solution and put it into the rat hole, and immediately seal the hole with a mud block. C. Calcium cyanide poisoning method. Put this agent into a special powder duster, introduce it into the rat hole through a rubber tube, shake the powder duster by hand to blow in the toxic powder, using three to five grams per hole. D. Carbon monoxide method. Use compressed carbon monoxide gas and introduce it into the warehouse through a skin tube. A small warehouse can be fumigated in ten minutes. (4) Raising cats to catch rats is one of the best ways to eliminate rats. In areas where rat plague is prevalent, it has the effect of preventing the occurrence of rat plague. As for the bird pest problem, attention should be paid to closing doors and windows tightly, and adding a layer of bamboo net outside the warehouse window. If the warehouse lacks a ceiling and there are gaps between the eaves and the warehouse, a bamboo net should be added to prevent birds from entering.

　　5. Mold damage prevention: If the grain has too much moisture and high temperature, mold is most likely to occur, causing the grain to rot and clump, making it inedible. The main one is Penicillium, which turns the rice yellow-brown and fragile. This disease is prone to occur at a temperature of 22.2 degrees Celsius and a moisture content of 15.5% or more. The second is Apsidia bacteria, which first makes the grain form a silk-like network, changing from amber to dark brown. This disease is prone to occur at a grain temperature of 30 to 34 degrees Celsius and a moisture content of more than 15.7%. Another is Vospora sp bacteria, which can turn rice red. The main way to prevent and control is to keep the moisture content of the food low. Whether grain is stored in围席(Wéixí) piles or in warehouses in our country, the surface layer of the grain is prone to mold. The reason is that the damp and hot air between the grains rises to the surface layer. When the outside temperature is low, the moisture condenses, causing the upper grain to mold. Prevention methods: add half a foot of plant ash to the surface layer, or cover a layer of rice husk wheat bran. For large 围屯(Wéitún), ventilation bamboo baskets should be inserted to help eliminate the damp and hot gas in the grain.

　　粮食储藏的科学管理法
    浙江省杭州农业改进所  高文彬
    （编者按：高文彬先生此文对粮食储藏与管理方法，就技术方面提供了一此意见，有些意见是各地容易办到的；有些则是暂时不易办到的，甚至还须加以研究的。但对于如何改进粮食保管工作，必须引起各地的注意。希望各地实际从事粮食保管工作的同志，能将工作经验写来，以供各地研究学习，共同努力，改进这一重要工作。）
    各地仓库要想粮食安全，不致霉烂生虫，必须行合理的储藏。“合理储藏”的主要条件在于温度、含水量适宜，防除虫害、霉害。比如“米象”（土名麦蚰子）的发生，与温度就有很大关系。如果米温在摄氏一三．一度以下，米谷含水量在百分之十一点八以下，“米象”就不能繁殖。若米谷含水量在百分之十四以上，温度达摄氏三十度左右的时候，那么一般仓虫即迅速繁殖，在短期内可使米谷重量减轻，质量损坏。就霉菌论：粮食含水量在百分之十六以上，温度在摄氏二十五度时最易繁殖。易使食粮腐化生臭味。若温度在摄氏二十度以下，水份含量在百分之十三以下，即不生霉。就粮食本身论：亦宜于存于低温处，使呈休眠状态。若粮食温度高，湿度大，其呼吸和发酵作用就旺盛起来，使所含的养份减少，滋养价值也就降低了。由以上种种情形看来，粮食要想贮藏长久，不使它霉烂生虫、量减质变，就必须保持于干燥冷凉的状态中。根据食粮安全贮藏的原理，仓储实施工作要项有二：
    一、建修合理仓库  粮食储藏的安全是和合理仓库与科学管理分不开的。如仓库建筑不良，湿气、热度易于侵入，害虫霉菌容易发生。如仓库建筑不坚固，也容易遭受鼠害。合理的仓库要坚固密闭，湿热虫鼠不能侵入，像圆筒式钢骨水泥仓--谷槽，放入粮食，能与外界湿热隔绝，不受外界的影响，食粮能长久保存。据研究，凡充分干燥的糙米行密封贮藏，可免虫害。虽四年以后发芽力仍不减。米的物理性亦无变化，滋养份不减，胚部维他命Ｂ与新米同。小麦含水量在百分之十二以下者，行密封储藏，经二年后色泽仍可保存，无害虫，发芽力亦不减。而在通风储藏下，虽仓库建筑完善，管理周密，安全期也仅不过二年。因此，理想的贮藏方式，应以充分干燥的粮食，密封储藏在高燥冷凉的处所。所以按照储藏原理，建修合理仓库，是解决仓储问题的根本办法。
    二、实行技术管理  仓库建筑合理，管理自易。像以上所说的圆筒式仓库，能于储前将食粮经过干热（华氏一六○度至一八○度），使其含水量降至百分之十四以下，并杀灭害虫，这样行密封贮藏后，自能保持长久。但是，我国目前此种仓库甚少。仓库建筑情形，根据川、湘、豫、鄂、桂等省调查，主要为木板仓，这种木仓或系独立建筑，或修建于庙宇祠堂民房里。次为青砖仓、泥仓、三合土仓。上项仓廒多缺天花板和通风、密闭装置，难以防虫、防鼠、防雀、防湿、防热。在四川、广西虽已有少数新式仓库，但密封、防虫、防鼠条件尚不够。处于这种情况下，自应多注意管理问题。兹按目前我国仓储情形，将应注意管理事项分述于下：
    １、粮食入仓的检定：粮食进仓的时候，首应用水份测定器或用手砻、牙嗑等法检查水份。若不干燥，应行日晒或经烘干后再行入仓。近来公粮存储，霉烂损失颇大，主要由于验收的时候，水份检验工作不够。简单的检验方法：①手验法-手插入粮食堆没有冷湿的感觉的，是干燥的粮食。手插入后觉有热意的，已发热。若是稻谷，可将谷放于左掌，用右掌磨碾，干燥的壳易脱离。②牙嗑-粮食用牙嗑，干脆爽裂者干燥。手砻检查-手砻系用木制，接合面有磨状齿，将谷放入手砻，加以磨碾，干燥的壳易碎脱；磨后将谷壳吹去，查看，米断碎少的即身份干燥。除检查粮食的干燥外，更应注意有没有害虫和杂质的多少。
    ２、储粮发热的防止：堆储粮食最大的毛病就是容易发热。粮食发了热，不但使所含蛋白质、脂肪等减少，且使食味变恶，臭陈难闻。防止粮食发热，实管理仓储人员所应日夜不懈的事。查粮食储藏期间发热原因有三：（１）水份过多；（２）霉菌的寄生；（３）虫害的发生。其中水份过多为主要原因。普通粮食含水量在百分之十四以下，即不起发热现象。预防发热第一，要减低粮食含水量。第二，散积热，粮堆里应插置通气竹篓。竹篓系用竹片编成，高约一丈，直径一尺至八寸，圆筒形，每四平方尺谷堆应设置一个。麻袋堆储的时候，不可堆积过紧，应行八包层叠堆储法，或六包堆法。若干燥较差的，可行四包层叠堆储法，以利通风。如果粮食已发热，应即进行转仓、车风或进行日晒。若是因害虫猖獗而发热，应进行杀虫工作。
    ３、虫害防除：我国地域辽阔，南北气候差异甚大，仓库害虫的分布也不同。大致可划分为华南、华中、华北和长城以北四个区域。华南气候温暖而湿润，食粮害虫很厉害。稻谷储藏的害虫首推谷蠹，此虫以川、湘、赣、桂储粮最为严重。像广西西北部，稻多用穗储，麦蛾也相当厉害。华中豫、鄂、皖等省，小麦、玉米的主要害虫有米象和麦蛾，面粉害虫，有拟谷盗、大谷盗、粉。华北及东北气候干燥，且湿暖期较短，仓储问题，仓库害虫属于次要。因此华南地区应时时进行仓虫防治。华中一带应及时注意检查。华北和东北应于必要时进行仓虫处理。兹将害虫防治的方法择要介绍于次：（１）日晒和车扇。日晒和车扇是我国现下仓储中防除害虫简而易行的办法。当粮食有生虫、发热和潮湿等现象时，应选日光强烈的日子进行日晒。晒的时候，厚度不可过二寸。尤应时时翻动。据研究，用含水份百分之二十三．八的新收小麦，平铺于长六尺阔三尺的席上，每席一八市斗。日晒平均气温摄氏二七．三度，晒八小时后，含水量可减为百分之十二．七。由于经过日晒，就可以除杀害虫，降低水份，减少霉害。晒后再用风车车扇，去杂质，兼能降低粮食温度湿度。（二）药剂熏蒸--此法系利用某几种药剂，施放于仓库里，使逐渐挥发为气体，以熏杀储粮的害虫，且兼有杀鼠灭菌的效果。此法普通要在能密闭的仓库或容器内举行。若仓库不能密闭，可利用熏蒸帐幕。熏蒸药剂种类很多，有氯化苦、二氯乙烯、二硫化炭、溴甲烷等。但有的药剂易引火，有的不能单独使用。最好的是氯化苦，此药渗透力强，有催泪性，普通不影响发芽力，效力大，我国已能自制。在一千立方尺的体积内，只须一至二磅，用垂帘漏槽法使药剂散布即能生效。据经验：谷堆过三尺以上，还应设通气竹篓，以助其渗透；熏时温度应在摄氏二十度以上，熏蒸时间四十八小时，熏毕要打开仓库门窗、散放毒气。待一周后，谷物即可取用。毒气熏蒸工作，应据有熏蒸经验的人才可举行。（３）高低温歼除法。高温不但能歼除害虫，且有干燥储粮的效果。没有危险性，且不留恶味。惟设备费较高，是它的缺点。像米象虫在高温摄氏五四．四度，三小时即死亡，麦蛾幼虫和蛹在摄氏四八．九度，四小时全死。小麦在华氏一五○度、虽八小时，对发芽力无妨。面粉厂里行干热杀虫，常在摄氏四八．九度至五一．七度，十至十二小时，能杀死面粉内所有害虫。行高温歼除时，如温度较差，时间要延长。其次是低温歼除，像干果类、葡萄干、梅干，在摄氏零下十二度至二．二度，可免虫害。米象虫在一三．一度以下，就会停止繁殖。低温歼除能保持米谷冷凉，制止害虫繁殖。在东北和华北，冬季气温每至零下数十度，食粮可行冻冷干燥法，既可杀虫。复可降低含水量。（４）粉末防治法，是将某几种粉末掩盖于粮食表层，或与之拌和，可防治积谷害虫，现下药粉颇多。但多对人有毒害，仅可做种子储藏用。关于这类办法，我国民间已有采用，如江浙一带，有的用草木灰或石灰掩盖在米的表层。广西农民有的用石灰拌包谷贮藏。普通民间小量储粮，可以采用这些经验，将晒干的粮食放入磁瓮或缸里，装满，表层盖木灰或石灰，厚约二寸，有防虫、鼠的效果。据调查：用绿豆二份与石灰一份拌合，可防除绿豆象虫，用百分之三的Ｄ、Ｄ、Ｔ，每两与种子一百斤拌合，可杀种子贮藏期间的各种害虫。食粮入仓前应彻底将仓库清除，不许有陈粮，然后用Ｄ、Ｄ、Ｔ油类乳剂或水湿性Ｄ、Ｄ、Ｔ液喷射，每千平方英尺用一加仑，对仓虫的预防效果很好。
    ４、鼠雀防除：食粮贮藏期间，鼠类为害也很厉害。不但偷食、污染了粮食，而且要破坏仓库和包装用具，传染病疾。防除法：（１）毒饵诱杀：甲、炭酸钡--本剂色白，无臭味，性缓价廉，鼠食后逃出洞外，饮水即死。配合法：炭酸钡一份，面粉四份（重量比），加适量的水，制成粘团，撒于鼠常到的地方。或将上制的粘团分成一寸大小的块，浸溶于羊烛溶液，用筷取出，不要用手触，如用猪油菜油煎更佳。（注意，本药对人畜亦有毒害）。乙、红海葱--红海葱系多年生球茎，为杀鼠专用药。配合量：海葱粉一两，加谷粉四两五钱，再加适量之水拌和施用，或将海葱粉制成糊状，涂于菜叶瓜片上，也可生效。（２）用捕鼠器捕捉。现下印度式捕鼠器效能颇佳，每次可活捉一窝。此外钢条弹夹也可以用。（３）毒气熏杀：甲、硫磺熏杀法。用硫磺一份、硝石一份、牛脂适量，先将硫磺硝石拌合均匀，次加入牛脂，制成棒状，长约三寸，点燃后投入鼠穴（注意不要混入炭屑，以免变成了火药）。乙、氯化苦毒杀法。找得鼠穴，可用棉絮一块浸氯化苦液，投入鼠穴，立刻用泥块将穴口堵封。丙、氰化钙毒杀法。将本剂装入专用的撒粉器，以橡皮管引入鼠穴，手摇撒粉器，使毒粉吹入，每穴用三至五克。丁、一氧化炭法。用一氧化炭压缩气，经皮管引入仓内，小仓熏十分钟即可。（４）养猫捕鼠，是现下很好的除鼠办法之一。在鼠疫流行区域，更有防止发生鼠疫的效果。至于雀害问题，应平时注意紧闭门窗，仓窗外加一层竹网。若是仓库缺天花板，仓檐与仓间有孔隙，应加设竹网，使鸟不能侵入。
    ５、霉害防治：粮食如含水量多，温度高，霉类最易发生，致使粮食霉烂结块，不能食用。其中主要是青霉，使米变成黄褐色，性脆弱。在温度摄氏二二．二度含水量百分之十五．五以上容易发生此病，其次是Apsid ia菌，先使粮食结成丝网状，由饴色变成暗褐，此病在谷温摄氏三十至三十四度。含水量超过百分之十五．七时容易发生。再是Vospora sp菌，能使米变红色。防治的办法，主要使食粮含水量低。我国贮粮不管用围席堆储，或仓库散堆，粮食表层每易霉烂。考其原因，由于粮食间的湿热之气，往上升达表层，遇外界温度较低，水分凝结，致使上部粮食霉烂。防止的办法。表层可加草木灰半尺，或掩盖稻壳麦糠一层，围屯大的，应插通气竹篓，以利排除粮食里的湿热气体。
