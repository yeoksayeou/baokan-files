　　People's Bank of China Zhejiang Branch
    Issues Large Agricultural Loans to Support Increased Cotton and Hemp Production
    [Reported by this newspaper] The People's Bank of China Zhejiang Branch held a joint conference of managers of all branches and directors of directly affiliated offices in Zhejiang Province, starting on the 6th of this month. After the branch summarized its business report for 1949, and the various branches and directly affiliated offices reported on their work, the meeting arranged the work plan for the first half of this year and determined the business policy. Lasting fifteen days, the meeting concluded successfully on the 20th.
    During the meeting, in addition to focusing on reporting on their work over the past six months, each branch raised many suggestions and criticisms regarding the leadership of the branch, enabling the bank's work in the province to take a step forward on the existing foundation, creating favorable conditions. Therefore, in discussing and deciding on the work plan for the first half of 1950, in addition to referring to last year's experience and advantages as guidance for the work, shortcomings will be overcome in order to better serve the people, so that the bank's work in the province can be competent and pleasant in the gradual development of production and the gradual prosperity of the economy.
    The specific work arrangements for the first half of this year will focus on developing urban and rural supply and marketing businesses, strengthening financial management, and launching agricultural loans. In order to cooperate with the great production campaign this spring, a total of 32 million catties of rice (converted for calculation) are planned for agricultural loans this year, with 80 percent concentrated on fertilizer loans and 20 percent for other agricultural loans. In addition, 5 billion yuan in Renminbi will be allocated to support the transportation and marketing of local and special products. Due to the urgency of time and the large amount, it is necessary to start immediately. In order to cooperate with the increase in cotton and hemp production, solve the problem of industrial raw materials, and smash the enemy's blockade, the focus of the loans will be on supporting cotton and hemp farmers with fertilizer, giving priority to the needs of cotton and hemp, and using the surplus for grain production. It is estimated that one-third of the cotton fields and one-half of the hemp fields will be loaned, which can roughly solve the fertilizer shortage problem for cotton and hemp farmers.
    In terms of preparatory work, in addition to the chemical fertilizers, oil cakes, lime, etc. that have already been purchased, there is still a large shortage. After returning, each bank will immediately carry out purchases. In the summary, Manager Zhou specifically pointed out that the purchase should be combined with rural sideline industries, lime kilns, coal ash, and oil production, which can both complete the task and develop production.
    Finally, special emphasis was placed on treasury work, ensuring that every bit of national income is deposited into the treasury to guarantee financial unity.

　　人民银行浙江分行
    发放大量农贷扶助棉麻增产
    【本报讯】中国人民银行浙江分行于六日起在该行召开之浙省各支行经理暨直属办事处主任联席会议，经过分行总结一九四九年业务工作报告，各支行及直属办事处工作汇报，布置今年上半年工作计划，决定业务进行方针，历时十五天，会议已于二十日完满闭幕。
    在会议中各支行除重点的汇报了半年来的工作外，对分行之领导提出很多建议及批评，使该省银行工作在现有的基础上提高一步，有了很好的条件，故在讨论与决定一九五○年上半年的工作计划中，除参考去年的经验与优点，作为工作之指导外，对于缺点将予以克服，以期更好的为人民服务，使该省银行工作在生产逐渐发展，经济逐步繁荣中，能胜任愉快。
    今年上半年具体工作的布置，以开展城乡供销业务，加强金融管理，举办农业贷款三项工作为主。为配合今春之大生产运动，今年农贷共计划贷放大米（折合计算）三千二百万斤，以百分之八十集中在贷肥上，百分之二十作其他农业贷款，此外并拨人民币五十亿作为扶植土产特产运销之用，因时间紧迫，数额庞大，需立即着手办理，为配合增产棉麻，解决工业原料，粉碎敌人封锁，故在贷款中，以贷肥扶植棉农麻农为主，先尽棉麻之需要，多余部分再用于粮食增产，预计棉田贷放三分之一，麻田贷放二分之一，大致能解决棉麻农之缺肥问题。
    准备工作上除已购就之化肥、油饼、石灰等外，尚缺少很大数字，各行回去后立即进行收购。在总结中周经理特别指出，收购时应结合农村副业、石灰窑、煤灰及油等生产，既能完成任务，又能发展生产。
    最后对金库工作特别强调的提出，务使国家收入点滴入库，以保证财政统一。
