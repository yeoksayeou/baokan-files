Xinhua News Agency, Dihua, February 26th: Comrade Wang Zhen, Secretary of the Xinjiang Sub-bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, delivered a speech at the ceremony of Saifuddin and others joining the Communist Party. The full text is as follows: Comrades:

    Today, the communist elements among the various nationalities of Xinjiang Province are holding an admission ceremony in front of the Party flag, in front of the portraits of Marx, Engels, Lenin, Stalin, and Comrade Mao Zedong, the leader of the Chinese Communist Party, in the Xinjiang Sub-bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China. On behalf of the Sub-bureau, I extend a warm welcome to the comrades joining the Party and wish the comrades to fight for the victory of New Democracy and Socialism under the banner of Marxism-Leninism and under the leadership of Comrade Mao Zedong.

    Comrades, you are all outstanding sons of the people of all nationalities in Xinjiang Province. Before joining the Party, you have all participated in the revolutionary struggle against oppression for many years under the influence of communist ideology, undergone practical training, become people's soldiers, and become cadre talents of the whole Party. The Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and Comrades Mao Zedong, Liu Shaoqi, etc., have listened to Comrade Saifuddin's report and learned that you have a strong desire to join the Party. Therefore, the Party Central Committee ordered the Xinjiang Sub-bureau to accept you into the Party. According to the instructions of the Central Committee, your admission to the Party only requires individual review and the introduction of two formal Party members, and there is no need for a probationary period. Because years of revolutionary struggle have been your period of testing, once you join the Party, you can become a formal member of the Communist Party of China. After joining the Party, you comrades should be incorporated into certain branches and groups, receive communist education, and the branch is a communist school. Every Party member must study hard in accordance with the Party's regulations, regularly read Party newspapers and Party documents, conscientiously study the Party's policies, and systematically read the works of Marx, Engels, Lenin, Stalin, and Comrade Mao Zedong. In addition, you must further train yourself in leading the masses' struggle, strive to strengthen ties with the masses, and conduct criticism and self-criticism in daily organizational life. Only in this way can you continuously improve your political level and working ability, make yourself a good student of Chairman Mao, and become an excellent Communist Party member.

    The people of Xinjiang have a long history of revolutionary struggle. The revolutionary struggle of the people of Xinjiang has developed under the influence and assistance of the Chinese Communist Party and the Soviet Union. In the early days of the Anti-Japanese War, Sheng Shicai, the feudal warlord of Xinjiang, superficially expressed his willingness to unite with the Soviet Union and the Chinese Communist Party. At that time, the Chinese Communist Party sent some comrades to work in Xinjiang, and a group of progressive youths from Xinjiang went to study in the Soviet Union, thus planting the seeds of revolution and spreading socialist ideas in Xinjiang. In 1942, Sheng Shicai began to brutally suppress the Xinjiang revolutionary movement, arresting and killing a large number of communists and progressives, hating the Soviet Union, and surrendering to Chiang Kai-shek and imperialism, plunging Xinjiang into darkness. Conscious people of Xinjiang, in order to resist the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang represented by Sheng Shicai, launched an uprising in 1944 and launched a heroic struggle against the Kuomintang reactionaries. In the revolutionary struggle, the people of Xinjiang created revolutionary base areas including the three districts of Ili, Tacheng, and Ashan, created a strong national army composed of children of all nationalities, and formed a democratic united front organization including people of all nationalities in Xinjiang—the New Alliance. The three districts of Ili, Tacheng, and Ashan have now become a part of the unified leadership of the Xinjiang People's Government. The National Army has now become the Fifth Army of the People's Liberation Army. After you comrades join the Party, the Xinjiang Sub-bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China will strengthen the leadership of the Fifth Army through you, making the Fifth Army a truly army under the leadership of the Communist Party, an army educated in the spirit of internationalism, and an armed force loyal to the working people. The New Alliance now has more than 50,000 members. In the future, it will be a broad organization of the democratic united front of the people of all nationalities under the leadership of the Party. After you comrades join the Party, you should not only not withdraw from the New Alliance, but also strengthen its leadership.

    In Xinjiang, as in any other place, to undertake the task of reforming society and to advance the revolution, it is impossible without the strong leadership of the Communist Party. In the early days of the Anti-Japanese War, although some comrades of the Chinese Communist Party were already working in Xinjiang, because Xinjiang was still a feudal and economically backward area, there was no modern industry, no modern proletariat, and no revolutionary ideological preparation, so it was not yet qualified to organize the Communist Party. Later, the communists in Xinjiang were imprisoned and massacred by Sheng Shicai, making it impossible to build the Party. Now, the people of Xinjiang have undergone years of revolutionary struggle, and due to the great victory of the national people's revolutionary war, Xinjiang has been peacefully liberated, and the powerful People's Liberation Army has entered Xinjiang, thus creating mature conditions for the establishment of a communist party organization in Xinjiang. The establishment of the Xinjiang communist party organization is a major event in the lives of the people of Xinjiang, and it will guarantee that the people of Xinjiang will smoothly embark on the road to building a new democratic society and a communist society.

    Religion still has an important influence among the people of all nationalities in Xinjiang. The Mongolian people believe in Lamaism, and other nationalities believe in Islam. What attitude should communists take towards religion? On the one hand, communists themselves are dialectical materialists and historical materialists, and are absolute atheists. But at the same time, communists believe that the state should allow people to have freedom of religious belief. The basic form of oppression and exploitation of the people of all nationalities in Xinjiang is the feudal land system. The people of Xinjiang all have anti-feudal demands. In order to break the shackles of feudal oppression, they participated in the heroic struggle against the Kuomintang reactionaries. But the situation is somewhat different on the issue of religion. Due to the long-term influence of religion, the people of all nationalities have developed deep-rooted religious superstitious habits. Therefore, under these conditions, we should not launch a struggle against religion among the masses outside the Party. The issue of religion can never be resolved by force. On the contrary, we communists should respect the religious habits of the people of all nationalities. As long as they have politically, economically, and culturally turned over, religious superstition will naturally decline. Lenin once pointed out that, like the bourgeois parties of the past, if we regard the roots of religion as the ignorance of the masses and believe that our main task is only to overthrow religion, support atheism, and propagate atheistic views, then this is actually a bourgeois, superficial, and narrow culturalist view. Lenin believed that the anti-religious struggle must not be limited to abstract ideological propaganda, but should be linked to the concrete practice of that class movement that seeks to eliminate the social roots of religion, and that the propagation of atheism should be subordinate to the basic tasks of the Party, subordinate to the task of developing the class struggle of the exploited masses against the exploiters. We communists must firmly grasp these principles of Lenin in dealing with the issue of religion, so as not to make mistakes.

    The Xinjiang Sub-bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the People's Liberation Army have entered Xinjiang and have been warmly welcomed by the people of Xinjiang. The people of Xinjiang regard Chairman Mao and the Communist Party as their liberators and saviors, which makes us extremely moved. But in order to completely liberate the people of all nationalities, in order to establish a Leninist-Stalinist party among the people of all nationalities in Xinjiang to lead the people's revolution, communists among the people of all nationalities in Xinjiang must strengthen the internationalist propaganda and education of the people of all nationalities, overcome the two deviations of Han chauvinism and narrow nationalism, so as to consolidate the friendship and mutual assistance of the people of all nationalities and strengthen the unity and cooperation between local cadres and outside cadres. Only in this way can the revolutionary cause of the people of Xinjiang develop smoothly. Comrades, after you join the Party, you will have greater responsibility for the revolutionary cause of the people of Xinjiang. We communists from the mainland must use all our strength to wholeheartedly help you and work hand in hand with you. The revolutionary experience in various regions of China proves that if local cadres and local mass leaders are not cultivated, the revolution cannot take root and deepen. This is an important instruction of Comrade Mao Zedong on the issue of the Chinese revolution. The Xinjiang Sub-bureau of the Central Committee of the Party must follow this instruction of Comrade Mao Zedong, attach importance to the work of cultivating local cadres, and humbly study and learn from the experience of the Xinjiang revolutionary struggle, so that it can be well combined with the entire Chinese revolutionary experience. And in terms of local cadres, they must recognize that only the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the help of Party cadres from the mainland can shorten the time and reduce the cost of the liberation struggle of all nationalities in Xinjiang, thereby quickly achieving victory. The correct relationship between outside cadres and local cadres must be mutual respect and mutual learning, which is also one of the important criteria for identifying whether they are responsible to the people and loyal to the Party.

    A very arduous task lies before us. We must unite the broad masses of the people of Xinjiang, carry out social reforms step by step and with preparation, from weakening feudal forces to completely destroying feudal forces, building modern industry, and developing cultural and economic undertakings. In addition, the people of Xinjiang also have the obligation to assist the liberation cause of the Tibetan, Uygur, Tatar, Kazakh and other ethnic groups in neighboring provinces and regions. We believe that under the correct leadership of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and with the friendly assistance of our socialist neighbor, the Soviet Union, as long as we work together, these tasks can be accomplished.

    Your joining the Party shows the growth and development of our Party, the flesh-and-blood relationship between our Party and various ethnic minorities in the country, and the important development of the revolutionary cause of various ethnic minorities. On behalf of the Sub-bureau, I extend a warm communist salute to all comrades!

　　在赛福鼎等入党仪式上
    王震同志讲话全文
    【新华社迪化二十六日电】中共中央新疆分局书记王震在赛福鼎等加入共产党的仪式上的讲话。全文如下：同志们：
    新疆各民族中的共产主义分子，今天在中共中央新疆分局中，在党旗面前，在马克思、恩格斯、列宁、斯大林和中国共产党领袖毛泽东同志的肖像面前举行入党仪式，我代表分局对同志们的入党表示热烈欢迎，并祝同志们在马列主义的旗帜下和毛泽东同志的领导下，为新民主主义与社会主义的胜利而奋斗。
    同志们都是新疆省各民族人民的优秀的儿子。你们在入党以前都已经在共产主义思想影响下，参加了多年的反压迫的革命斗争，经过了实际的锻炼，成了人民的战士，成了全党的干部人才。中国共产党中央和毛主席、刘少奇同志等曾听取了赛福鼎同志的报告，知道了同志们有请求入党的坚强志愿，所以党中央命令新疆分局接受同志们入党，按照中央指示，你们的入党只要经过个别审查，经过两个正式党员的介绍，可以不要候补期。因为多年的革命斗争便是对你们的考验时期，一经入党，你们便可成为中国共产党的正式党员。同志们入党以后都要编入一定的支部与小组，受共产主义的教育，支部就是共产主义的学校。每个党员都要按照党的规定努力学习，要经常阅读党报和党的文件，要认真钻研党的政策，要有计划地阅读马克思、恩格斯、列宁、斯大林的著作和毛泽东同志的著作。此外，并须在领导群众斗争中去进一步锻炼自己，要努力加强与群众的联系，要在日常的组织生活中间进行批评和自我批评。只有这样，才能不断地提高自己的政治水平和工作能力，使自己成为毛主席的好学生，成为优秀的共产党员。
    新疆人民已有多年的革命斗争历史。新疆人民的革命斗争，是在中国共产党和苏联的影响和援助之下发展起来的。在抗日战争初期，新疆的封建军阀盛世才曾在表面上表示愿意联合苏联和中国共产党，当时中国共产党派遣了一些同志到新疆工作，新疆也有一批进步青年到苏联留学，因而在新疆种下了革命的种子，传播了社会主义思想。一九四二年，盛世才开始残酷地镇压新疆革命运动，逮捕和杀害大批共产党员和进步人士，仇视苏联，投降蒋介石和帝国主义，把新疆驱入黑暗的境地。有觉悟的新疆人民为了反抗以盛世才为代表的国民党反动统治，于一九四四年举行起义，向国民党反动派展开英勇的斗争。新疆人民在革命斗争中创立了包括伊犁、塔城、阿山三区的革命根据地，创立了一支由各民族子弟组成的强有力的民族军，并组成了一个包括新疆各族人民的民主统一战线组织--新盟。伊、塔、阿三区现已成为在新疆人民政府统一领导下的一部分。民族军现已成为人民解放军第五军，同志们入党以后，中共中央新疆分局就要通过同志们加强对第五军的领导，使第五军成为真正在共产党领导下的军队，成为在国际主义精神教育下的军队，成为忠于劳动人民的武装力量。新盟现已拥有五万多盟员，它今后则是在党领导下的各民族人民的民主统一战线的广泛组织，同志们入党以后，不但不要退出新盟，而且更要加强对它的领导。
    在新疆，如同在其他任何地方一样，要担负起一个改革社会的任务，要把革命推向前进，没有共产党的坚强领导，是根本不可能的。抗日战争初期，虽然已有一部分中国共产党的同志在新疆工作，但因当时新疆还是一个封建的经济落后的地区，没有近代工业，没有近代无产阶级，没有革命的思想准备，所以还没具备组织共产党的条件。以后，在新疆的共产党员又遭受了盛世才的监禁和屠杀，使建党工作无法进行。现在，新疆人民已经过多年革命斗争的锻炼，由于全国人民革命战争的伟大胜利，新疆已获得和平解放，强大的人民解放军已进入新疆，因而造成了在新疆建立共产党组织的成熟条件。新疆共产党组织的建立，是新疆人民生活中的一个重大事件，它将保证新疆人民顺利地走上建设新民主主义社会和共产主义社会的道路。
    宗教在新疆各民族人民中还有重要的影响。蒙古族信喇嘛教，其他各族信伊斯兰教。共产主义者对宗教应取什么态度呢？一方面，共产主义者自己是辩证唯物论者和历史唯物论者，是绝对的无神论者。但共产主义者同时认为，国家应当允许人民有信仰宗教的自由。新疆各民族人民被压迫被剥削的基本形式是封建的土地制度。新疆人民都有反封建的要求，为了打破封建压迫的枷锁，他们参加了反对国民党反动派的英勇斗争。但在宗教问题上情形却不同些。由于各民族人民受宗教的长期影响，已养成深厚的宗教迷信习惯。因此，在这种条件下，我们对党外群众就不应当发动反宗教的斗争。宗教问题决不是强力所可解决的。相反地，我们共产党人应该尊重各民族人民的宗教习惯，只要他们在政治上、经济上、文化上翻了身，宗教迷信便会自然衰退的。列宁曾经指出，如像过去的资产阶级政党那样，把宗教的根源看作是民众愚昧无知，认为自己的主要任务仅仅是打倒宗教，拥护无神论，宣传无神主义观点，那实际上是一种资产阶级的肤浅的偏狭的文化主义观点。列宁认为，决不能把反宗教斗争局限于抽象的思想宣传，而是应该使这一斗争同力求把宗教的社会根源铲除的那个阶级运动的具体实践联系起来，使无神主义的宣传服从于党的基本任务，服从于发展被剥削群众反对剥削者的阶级斗争的任务。我们共产党员在对待宗教问题上必须紧紧掌握列宁的这些原则，才不致犯错误。
    中共中央新疆分局和人民解放军进入新疆，受到新疆人民的热烈欢迎，新疆人民都把毛主席和共产党看成他们的解放者和救星，这使我们极为感动。但为了使各民族人民获得彻底解放，为了在新疆各民族人民中建立列宁、斯大林式的党来领导人民革命，新疆各民族中的共产党员就必须加强对各民族人民的国际主义的宣传教育，克服大汉族主义和狭隘民族主义的两种偏向，以巩固各民族人民的友爱与互助，加强本地干部与外来干部的团结合作。只有这样，新疆人民的革命事业才可能顺利发展。同志们，你们入党后，对于新疆人民的革命事业就负有更大的责任。我们从内地来的共产党员一定要用一切力量，全心全意地帮助你们，与你们携手前进。中国各个地区的革命经验证明，如果没有培养起本地干部和本地的群众领袖，革命便不能生根和深入。这是毛泽东同志在中国革命问题上的一项重要指示。党的中央新疆分局一定要遵照毛泽东同志这个指示，重视培养地方干部这个工作，并虚心研究和学习新疆革命斗争经验，使之与整个中国革命经验很好地结合起来。而在本地干部方面，则必须认识：只有中国共产党的领导和内地党的干部的帮助，才能使新疆各民族解放斗争缩短时间，减少代价，从而迅速地获得胜利。外来干部与本地干部间的正确关系必须是互相尊重，互相学习，这同时也就是鉴定他们是否对人民负责和对党忠诚的重要标准之一。
    摆在我们前面的是一个十分艰巨的任务。我们要团结新疆广大人民，有步骤有准备地进行社会改革，从削弱封建势力到彻底摧毁封建势力，建设近代工业，发展文化经济事业。此外，新疆人民并有义务去援助邻近各省区的藏族、维吾尔族、塔塔尔族、哈萨克族等民族的解放事业。我们相信，在中共中央的正确领导下，在我们的社会主义邻邦苏联的友谊援助下，只要我们共同努力，这些任务是可以完成的。
    同志们的入党，表示了我们党的壮大与发展，表示了我们党与国内各少数民族的血肉关系，表示了各少数民族革命事业的重要发展。我代表分局对各位同志致以热烈的共产主义的敬礼！
