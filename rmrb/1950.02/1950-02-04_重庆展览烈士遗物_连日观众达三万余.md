Xinhua News Agency Report: From January 19th to 27th of last month, Chongqing held an exhibition of relics of General Yang Hucheng and hundreds of martyrs who were murdered by Kuomintang secret agents. The exhibition included photos and paintings depicting the secret agents' brutal killing of General Yang Hucheng and over a hundred patriotic individuals, as well as various American-made torture instruments and weapons used by the secret agents to kill people. Among the martyrs' relics were the embroidery of female Communist Party member Li Qinglin, the five-pointed star that worker Yu Zusheng crafted in prison using a toothbrush handle, and General Huang Xiansheng's daily calendar, torn to November 27th (the day General Huang and hundreds of other patriots were martyred). These items were of particular commemorative significance. In addition, there were countless blood-stained clothes left behind by the martyrs and numerous posthumous works filled with love for the motherland, love for the people, hatred for the enemy, and vivid emotions. The exhibition was held at the Chongqing Women's Normal School, and it attracted 31,657 visitors in consecutive days. Many spectators stood in the rain, waiting to enter.
