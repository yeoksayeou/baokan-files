　　The Soviet Army – A Bulwark of World Peace

　　"Peace is terrible." An American reporter used this sarcastic remark to accurately portray the nervous breakdown of American monopoly capitalists. These monopolists are already enjoying the fruits of militarism in the United States and Western European countries. They expect more profits if they can drag the world into a new military disaster.

　　Imperialists, embracing plans to dominate the world, even abhor the idea of ​​possibly establishing a peaceful order, the idea of ​​maintaining lasting peace. However, the overwhelming majority of mankind is deeply concerned about lasting and long-term democratic peace. This is why the broad masses of all countries (including the United States) so enthusiastically support the conclusion of peace treaties. This is why the Soviet Union's unremitting and resolute struggle for universal and lasting democratic peace, against warmongers, is supported by millions of people on all continents.

　　The Soviet Union leads the anti-imperialist camp, the front for the struggle for lasting democratic peace and the security of the people. However, in its struggle for peace, the Soviet Union cannot ignore the fact that the policy of inciting new wars pursued by the Anglo-American ruling clique is primarily aimed at the Soviet people, who are successfully realizing the construction of a communist society. The Soviet people take Stalin's instructions as a guide:

　　“While developing socialist peaceful construction, we must not forget for a minute the conspiracies of the international reactionaries who are concocting new war plans. It must be remembered the great Lenin's instruction that, even when turning to peaceful work, it is necessary to constantly defend and protect the armed forces and the country's national defense, like defending and protecting one's eyes."

　　The Soviet Union's military strength is a reliable bulwark of the Soviet Union's peace-loving foreign policy and a faithful guardian of the peaceful cause of the people of the great socialist power.

　　The Soviet armed forces, commemorating their thirty-second anniversary, are a new type of army. Only Soviet society can build such an army and inspire its powerful sources of material and spiritual strength. For the first time in history, such an army has been established, whose soldiers are inseparable from the people, the people's labor, the people's interests, and the people's expectations, and they understand well what they are fighting for.

　　Marxist-Leninist science has long proved that the armies of imperialist countries are tools of the oppressor countries and weapons of capital against labor. This is clearer in our time than ever before. Let's take a look at the world map: Why are Britain, the United States, France, and the Netherlands still using force in this "time of peace"? They use force to suppress the people's democratic liberation movements in Greece, Indonesia, Vietnam, Burma, Malaya, the Philippines, and many other countries with iron and blood. They are fighting not only in the colonies but also in their own countries: Didn't French tank brigades go to suppress the strikes of French miners!

　　Such an army, which serves as a weapon for colonial plunder and coercion of the people, cannot have any high moral standards. They can only rely on the power of their killing machines. However, no machine is dead, be it in industry or even more so in war. One of the weakest points of the planners of new aggression and new world wars lies here.

　　The experience of the Soviet armed forces for more than 30 years has demonstrated the infinite height of their moral standards and moral potential, and has also demonstrated how great and decisive this fact has been in the past and is now. The purpose of the Soviet army is lofty, because the Soviet government has never waged, cannot, and will never wage unjust wars of aggression. The advancing ideology of the Soviet army, motivated by the lofty ideals of friendship among the people, is one of the foundations of its strength.

　　The Soviet armed forces are the leading army in history, possessing not only the highest standards of military technology but also progressive military science. Military science, as a department of Marxist-Leninist social science, was founded by Stalin – the leader of the Soviet people and the organizer of the Soviet armed forces. The fact that the Hitlerite legions, which once threatened all the armies of the world, were defeated by the Soviet army is the most obvious proof that the Soviet armed forces are good at successfully applying Stalin's science of victory.

　　World War II, for our armed forces, as for the entire Soviet people, was the most severe test. This test was passed gloriously, because "the socialist system created by the October Revolution gave our people and our army a great and invincible force."
(Stalin)

　　The Soviet armed forces, united with the people, fully supported by our socialist system, and finely equipped with the latest weapons and ammunition produced by our factories, gloriously fulfilled their tasks. They not only defended Russia but also liberated the European people from the shackles of fascism, defeated the Hitlerite army and the Hitlerite state, and saved Europe and the whole world from fascist enslavement. It is natural that the broad masses of the world's people regard the Soviet army as their true guardian of peace and a faithful friend of international security. The existence of this force is a major obstacle in the path of the ambitious Anglo-Americans who dream of dominating the world: No matter how deep their military hysteria is, the fate of Hitler and the Hitlerite state cannot but cool their adventurous flames.

　　All the hopes of today's warmongers are pinned on the American atomic bomb, which they tout as a tool for easy victory in a blitzkrieg. But who does not remember that the Hitlerite bandits, who were defeated by the Soviet army, once hoped to rely on their planes and tanks to achieve a blitzkrieg victory? However, all of Hitler's plans suffered complete failure. Is it not obvious that the calculations of the Anglo-American fanatics who want to dominate the world today are as vague as those of their German predecessors?

　　The Soviet armed forces, established for thirty-three years, have adorned their banner with immortal glory in the struggle against the Soviet Union and the enemies of the majority of all progressive mankind. The Soviet armed forces, cultivated by the Party of Lenin and Stalin, have been, are, and will continue to be the faithful guardians of the Soviet Union's peaceful cause, leading the forces of democracy, peace, and world security.

### 苏联军队——全世界和平的堡垒

　　苏联军队——全世界和平的堡垒
    “和平是可怕的”。一个美国记者用这句讽刺的话毫厘不差地表现了美国独占资本家的神经错乱。这些独占者，现在已经在享受着美国及西欧诸国的军国主义的硕果。他们期待着更多的利润，如果他们能把世界拖进新的军事灾难中。
    抱着统治世界计划的帝国主义者，甚至厌恶关于可能建立和平秩序的思想，关于维护持久和平的思想。但是，占压倒多数的人类，都深切地关心着持久的、长期的民主和平。这便是一切国家（包括美国在内）的广大群众何以这样热烈支持订立和约的原因。这便是苏联不倦地和坚决地争取普遍的持久民主和平、反对战争煽动者而进行斗争的一贯政策受到各大陆数百万人的拥护和支持的原因。
    苏联领导着反帝国主义的阵营，为持久民主和平与人民安全而斗争的战线。但是，苏联在为和平而作斗争时，不能不注意那个事实，即英美统治集团执行的挑动新战争的政策，其方针首先是反对顺利地实现着共产主义社会建设的苏联人民。苏联人是以斯大林的指示作为指针的：
    “发展社会主义和平建设的时候，我们一分钟也不应当忘记编造新战争计划的国际反动派的阴谋。必须记住伟大的列宁的指示，即是转入和平工作时，要经常像防卫、保护眼睛那样，防卫、保护武装力量和我国的国防。”
    苏联的武力是苏联爱好和平的外交政策的可靠的堡垒，是伟大社会主义强国的人民的和平事业的忠实守卫者。
    纪念自己建立三十二周年的苏联武力，是一种新型的军队。只有苏维埃社会才能够建立这样的军队，才能鼓舞它那物质和精神力量的强有力的泉源。历史上第一次建立起这样的军队，它的战士和人民、人民的劳动、人民的利益与人民的期望是分不开的，他们很了解，他们是为了什么而斗争的。
    马列主义的科学早就证实了帝国主义国家的军队是压迫者的国家的工具，是资本对付劳动的武器。这一点在我们的时代比过去任何时候表现得更清楚。我们看一看世界地图：英、美、法、荷为什么在现在“和平时候”还在施用武力呢？他们施用武力是为了用铁和血来镇压在希腊、印度尼西亚、越南、缅甸、马来亚、菲律宾及其他许多国家里的人民民主解放运动。他们非但在殖民地，而且在本国作战：法军的坦克队不是开去镇压法国矿山工人的罢工吗！
    这种作为殖民掠夺和威迫人民的武器的军队，不可能有任何高度的道德水准。他们只能依靠自己的杀人机械的力量。但是，没有人的机械是死的，在工业中是这样，在战争中更是这样。新的侵略、新的世界大战的计划者的最脆弱的地方之一，就在这里。
    苏联武力的三十多年的经验，表现出了它的道德水准和道德潜力的无限高度，而且，表现出了这个事实在过去和现在具有怎样巨大的决定意义。苏军的目的，是崇高的。因为苏联政府从来没有进行过、也不可能而且决不进行非正义的侵略战争。由人民的崇高的友爱思想推动的苏军的前进思想，是它的力量基础之一。
    苏联的武装力量，是历史上首屈一指的军队，它非但具有军事技术的最高水准，而且具有进步的军事科学。作为马列主义的社会科学之一部门的军事科学，是斯大林—苏联人民的领袖和苏联武力的组织者创立的。曾经威胁世界一切军队的希特勒军团被苏军打垮这一事实，就是苏联武力善于成功地运用斯大林的胜利科学的最显明的佐证。
    第二次世界大战，对于我们的武装力量，像对于全苏联人民那样，是最严厉的考验。这个考验是被光荣地通过了，因为“十月革命产生的社会主义制度，给了我国人民和我国军队以巨大的和不可征服的力量。”
                  （斯大林）
    和人民结合的、为我们社会主义全力支持的、用我国工厂生产的最新武器和弹药精良装配的苏联武装力量，光辉地完成了自己的任务。他们非但捍卫了俄罗斯，而且解放了法西斯羁绊下的欧洲人民，击溃了希特勒的军队和希特勒的国家，把欧洲及全世界从法西斯的奴役中拯救出来。全世界广大人民群众把苏军视为自己的真正守卫和平及国际安全的忠实友人，那是很自然的。这种力量的存在，是妄想由英美来统治世界的野心家的道路上的重大阻碍：无论他们患的军事歇斯特里是多么深沉，但是，希特勒和希特勒国家的命运不能不冷却他们的冒险火焰。
    今天的战争煽动者的一切指望，是寄托于美国的原子弹上面，他们把那原子弹宣传为闪电战中容易获胜的工具。但是，谁不记得被苏军打垮了的希特勒强盗曾指望依靠自己的飞机坦克获得闪电胜利呢？然而，希特勒的这一切计划都遭受了全盘失败。今天想独霸世界的英美狂妄家和他们的德国先辈的算盘是一样渺茫，不是很明显吗？
    成立迄今达三十三年的苏联武装力量，在和苏联的及所有进步人类的多数敌人的斗争中，以不朽的光荣渲染了自己的旗帜。由列宁斯大林党培养起来的苏联武装力量，过去、现在和将来都是领导着民主、和平及全世界安全力量的苏联的和平事业的忠实守卫者。
