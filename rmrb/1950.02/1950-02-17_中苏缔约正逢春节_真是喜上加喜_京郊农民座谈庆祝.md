The Sino-Soviet Treaty Signed Just in Time for Spring Festival
　　Truly Double the Joy!
　　Farmers in Beijing Suburbs Hold Discussions to Celebrate
　　The farmers of Balizhuang in the eastern suburbs of the capital, who had only recently and victoriously completed land reform, were happily busy preparing for the Spring Festival when they suddenly heard the news of the signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance. Everyone was doubly happy. Many people gathered at the home of village farmers' association director Li Wengui, discussing it with great excitement. Fang Zhensheng, a sixty-two-year-old farmer, said humorously, "The Soviet Union and our China have signed a treaty of friendship, alliance, and mutual assistance, returning Lushun, Dalian, and the Chinese Changchun Railway. They are also lending us money to buy machinery and helping us with construction. I will definitely work hard to increase production." Liu Zhenqing, a young man, gesticulated as he said, "The Soviet Union is our true friend! This time, the Soviet Union is helping us so that we can live a good life. The last time we visited the farm, we saw a tractor that could cultivate 130 mu of sandy land in a day. It plows deep and saves effort. If the Soviet Union sells us tractors, our village must request one." Farmer Liu Hengbo added, "We farmers had no status at all in the old society. Since the founding of New China, life has been getting better day by day. As long as we work hard to produce, plus the help from the Soviet Union, the country's prosperity will come even faster."
　　On the evening of the 15th, the 14th district of Beijing suburbs convened a forum of farmers in Nanyuan Town to discuss the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance. The farmers all said, "Right on time for the Spring Festival, and such a good treaty signed, it's truly double the joy, a double cause for great celebration!"

　　中苏缔约正逢春节
    真是喜上加喜
    京郊农民座谈庆祝
    不久以前才胜利完成了土地改革的首都东郊八里庄农民，正在愉快地忙着准备过春节的时候，忽然听到中苏友好同盟互助条约签订的消息，大家都加倍的高兴。好多人聚集到村农会主任李文贵家里，兴高采烈地谈论起来。六十二岁的老农方振声幽默地说：“苏联和咱们中国订立了友好同盟互助条约，交还旅顺大连和中国长春铁路；还借钱给咱买机器，帮助咱建设，我一定好好闹生产。”年轻的刘振清指手划脚地说：“苏联是咱的真正朋友！苏联这次帮助咱，就是要叫咱过好日子。咱上次参观农场看见拖拉机，一天能耕沙地一百三十亩。耕得又深，又省事。苏联要卖给咱拖拉机的话，咱村一定要请求一架。”农民刘恒博补充说：“咱农民在旧社会根本就没地位。新中国成立后，日子一天比一天好。只要咱努力生产，再加上苏联帮助，国家的富强就来得更快了。”
    京郊十四区于十五日晚在南苑镇召集农民座谈中苏友好同盟互助条约。农民们都说：“正赶上过春节，又签订这么好的条约，真是喜上加喜，喜不胜喜的大喜事。”
