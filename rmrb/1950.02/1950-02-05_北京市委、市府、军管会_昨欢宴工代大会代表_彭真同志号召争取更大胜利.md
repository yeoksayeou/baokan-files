　　The Beijing Municipal Committee, Municipal Government, and Military Control Commission
    Host Banquet for Labor Representative Conference Delegates Yesterday
    Comrade Peng Zhen Calls for Striving for Greater Victories
    [Beijing News] The Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, the Beijing Municipal People's Government, and the Beijing Military Control Commission held a banquet last night (the 4th) to entertain the delegates to the first Beijing Municipal Labor Representative Conference. At about six o'clock, the delegates happily entered the Military Control Commission restaurant, filled with songs. When Comrade Peng Zhen, secretary of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, appeared in front of the microphone, the delegates stood up and applauded warmly for a long time. Comrade Peng Zhen said: Last year was a great year. In China, the Chinese people and the Chinese working class achieved victory. Worldwide, the forces of peace and democracy have grown stronger and greatly surpassed the counter-revolutionary forces. In Beijing, last year our Beijing people accomplished three major things: First, eliminate counter-revolutionary forces, establish the People's Government, and carry out various municipal constructions; Second, restore and develop production and improve productivity. Both public and private industries increased workers by about 50%; Third, defeat counter-revolutionary ideological education and build a new people's education. Comrade Peng Zhen pointed out: Without the People's Liberation Army, there would be no national victory, and there would be no liberation of Beijing. The People's Liberation Army is the first contributor. We want to thank the People's Liberation Army and pay tribute to the People's Liberation Army. But without the people of Beijing, especially the workers of Beijing, these three major events in Beijing would not have been successful. Therefore, the workers are the second contributor. We pay tribute to the workers of Beijing. Finally, Comrade Peng Zhen called out: The great victory in the past is not enough. There will be many difficulties in the future. We must be determined to overcome all difficulties and strive for greater victories, greater achievements, and greater success than last year! Beijing Mayor Nie Rongzhen emphasized in his speech: We should not be satisfied with today's victory. This is only the beginning of our work. The war is not completely over, and there are still many difficulties in victory. Our workers must overcome difficulties, improve production and trade unions, and build a new industrial Beijing! Yang Kaiwen, a representative of the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant, exclaimed excitedly in his reply: "With the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, our workers have changed from an oppressed position to become masters of the country and the leading class of the country! Today we are in control of the machines and we will use our own power to create a happy future! The past victory was created by our workers' own party, the People's Government, and the army. This shows that we can only be happy and successful if we unite around the party and support the government and the army!" Finally, he guaranteed on behalf of all the representatives: "We will hold the conference well and repay the party and the government with practical actions that exceed production targets!" The representatives who spoke in succession were very enthusiastic, and a group of people always surrounded the microphone. Ma Zhenwu, a representative of the knitting industry, said: "I am so happy. I never dreamed that I could come here to eat!" When Xiao Ming, director of the preparatory committee of the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, shouted: "Long live Stalin! Long live Mao Zedong!" everyone jumped up with excitement. The slogans "Long live Chairman Mao!" "Long live the Chinese Communist Party!" "The working class is not afraid of all difficulties!" and the songs "Without the Communist Party, there would be no New China" and "We workers have strength" were mixed together. At eight o'clock in the evening, the dinner was over, and everyone dispersed in joy amidst the chorus of "Unity is Strength."

　　北京市委、市府、军管会
    昨欢宴工代大会代表
    彭真同志号召争取更大胜利
    【北京讯】中国共产党北京市委员会、北京市人民政府、北京市军事管制委员会昨（四日）晚设宴招待京市首届工代大会代表。六时许，代表们愉快地走进军管会餐厅，歌声洋溢。当中共北京市委员会书记彭真同志出现在麦克风前面时，代表们都站起来热烈地长久鼓掌。彭真同志说：去年是伟大的一年，在中国，中国人民、中国工人阶级获得胜利了；在全世界，和平民主的力量更加壮大了，更大大超过反革命势力了；在北京，去年我们北京人民做了三件大事：一、消灭反革命势力，建立起人民政府，进行了各项市政建设；二、恢复与发展生产、提高了生产力，无论公私营工业都增加工人百分之五十左右；三、打倒了反革命的思想教育，建设起新的人民的教育。彭真同志指出：没有人民解放军就没有全国的胜利，也就没有北京市的解放，解放军是第一功臣。我们要感谢人民解放军，向人民解放军致敬。但是没有北京人民，特别是北京工人，北京的这三件大事也不会成功，因此工人是第二功臣，我们向北京工人致敬。最后，彭真同志号召：过去伟大的胜利还不够，今后还有许多困难，我们要下决心克服一切困难，争取比去年更大的胜利，更大的成绩，更大的成功！北京市市长聂荣臻在讲话时着重指出：我们不要满足于今天的胜利，这只是工作的开端，战争尚未完全结束，胜利中还有很多困难，我们工人要战胜困难，把生产和工会搞好，建设工业化的新北京！石景山钢铁厂代表杨开文在致答词时，兴奋地喊道：“有了中国共产党和毛主席的领导，我们工人由被压迫的地位变成了国家主人、国家的领导阶级了！今天我们掌握着机器，要用自己的力量去创造幸福的将来！过去的胜利，是我们工人自己的党、人民政府和军队创造出来的，这说明，我们只有团结在党的周围，拥护政府和军队，才有幸福，才能胜利！”最后他代表全体代表保证：“把大会开好，并用超过生产任务的实际行动来报答党和政府！”相继发言的代表非常踊跃，麦克风前总是围着一堆人。针织业代表马振武说：“我真高兴极了，作梦也想不到能到这儿来吃饭呀！”当市总工会筹委会主任萧明喊出：“斯大林万岁！毛泽东万岁！”时，大家都兴奋得跳起来。“毛主席万岁！”“中国共产党万岁！”“工人阶级不怕一切困难！”的口号声和“没有共产党就没有新中国”、“咱们工人有力量”的歌声，混成一片。到晚八点钟，会餐完了，全体在“团结就是力量”的合唱声中尽欢而散。
