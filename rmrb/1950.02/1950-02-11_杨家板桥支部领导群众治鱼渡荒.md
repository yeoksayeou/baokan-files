Yangjiabanqiao Branch Leads the Masses to Fight Famine by Curing Fish

Prefectural Committee Deputy Secretary-General Yan Ying

The Chinese Communist Party branch of Yangjiabanqiao Village in Yutian County, Hebei Province, led the masses of the whole village through a severe famine. It largely solved the livelihood problems of the 208 households and 930 people in the whole village, and was commended by the Tangshan Prefectural Committee of the Communist Party of China.

After Yangjiabanqiao Village suffered from floods, the masses were pessimistic and disappointed, and their thoughts were confused. Some asked for travel permits to beg for food; others planned to seek a living outside the village. More than 20 families, including Yang Liansan and Yang Wangshi, had run out of food; Lin Lingkui's family had been eating yellow cabbage stalks mixed with bran for more than ten days, and their faces were swollen; Yang Nihuan had run out of food and lay on the kang, on the verge of starvation. At that time, more than 100 of the 208 households in the village were only eating one meal a day.

At that time, the branch members were also confused for a time, but under the call of the higher party and the government and the idea of serving the people, after three or four days of discussion and research, they finally came up with a way to help themselves through production: such as curing fish, weaving mats, and spinning thread. Because curing fish was a major undertaking, the branch called on the masses to buy rawhide to make crotch pants. Some of the masses were too poor to afford crotch pants, so branch secretary Yang Wenkui and deputy branch secretary Yang Jirui temporarily lent their leather pants to them. There were seventy or eighty people in the village who could cure fish under the reed mats. However, the fish did not come to the mats, and everyone's life was still impossible, and their emotions were low again.

At this time, the branch held another meeting of party members to discuss ways to help themselves through production. Some talked about how they had led the masses in spinning and weaving production in the past. Some said how they had run cooperatives to overcome famine in the past. Someone proposed a method of driving fish to the reed mats; this opinion was immediately enthusiastically supported by all the party members. At that time, preparations before driving fish and methods of organizing the masses to cure fish were discussed. In order to encourage the enthusiasm of the masses for curing fish, a method of recording work points and bonus distribution and rules of reward and punishment were drawn up. It also put forward the method of mutual lending to solve the problem of lack of production funds for the masses.

The cadres and party members took the branch's opinions to the village cadre meeting for deliberation and discussion, and finally everyone agreed. The village chairman held a mass meeting of the whole village and put forward the method of driving fish to cure fish, which was immediately enthusiastically supported by the masses. At this time, the village chairman called on everyone to make preparations, to make good reed mats, and to tidy up the furniture. At this time, some households raised difficulties with furniture, and branch secretary Yang Wenkui lent Yang Yutian two reed mats and three catties of hemp; deputy branch secretary Yang Jirui lent Yang Yusheng three catties of hemp. Party member Yang Jibao lent Yu Yonghai and Yang Jisheng two reed mats each. Under their leading influence, mutual borrowing also began among the masses. At that time, Yang Tingxing, Yang Lianxing, Yang Zhenlin, Lin Lingkui and others were moved and said: "The Communist Party's leadership is really good?"

The Fish Curing Committee was established. Six fish curing committee members were elected, with two directors and deputy directors, two accounting gentlemen, and two in charge of supplies. According to the strength of labor, five people were formed into a group, a total of 38 groups. Each group elected someone with experience in curing fish and good labor to serve as the group leader.

Those who participated in curing fish were male laborers aged 18 to 55. Those without labor, over ten years old and under seventeen years old, and over fifty-five years old, as long as they could walk, could also participate in miscellaneous work. Those between the ages of 18 and 55 were all full shares; those under 17 and over 55 were half shares (can be increased if they work well), and a total of 207 people from the whole village participated in driving fish to cure fish.

In order to promote the production enthusiasm of the masses and avoid wasting time, reward and punishment measures were stipulated: (1) Half laborers who actively work can be increased, and full laborers who do not actively work should be reduced according to the specific situation. (2) Those who are late or leave early without reporting to the group leader should be deducted grain according to the length of time. Bring your own small sign to work every day, hand in the sign at the fishing ground, the first to come, the first to hand in, and the first to pick up the sign when leaving work. (3) Those who quarrel and fight in the fishing ground to hinder production should be reduced according to the amount.

In the curing fish production, the masses were very enthusiastic about production. For example, Da Nian, who was ten years old, Yang Qingnian, who was seventy-eight years old, shouted as loudly as the young men, and their hands and feet were not idle. Yu Keqin, Yang Jizheng and others were punished for fighting twice. Lin Qihuan was twenty-three years old and did not work well, and it was immediately proposed to reduce his share by 30% (for the day). Old man Yang Fengcong worked particularly hard, and he was immediately increased by 30%. In this way, not only did old man Yang Fengcong work more actively, but Lin Qihuan also became active, and at the same time, it encouraged the enthusiasm of all the masses. No one fought anymore.

They caught a lot of fish. One reed mat yielded more than 80,000 catties of fish, which sold for more than 100 stones of corn. Up to now, six reed mats have been used to catch fish, selling a total of more than 170 stones, and together with making shoes, spinning thread, and ropes, they have earned more than 200 stones of rice. Each full share has been allocated seven to eight dou of grain.

However, some deviations have also been found in the whole village's self-help production, and improvement measures have been proposed:

First, more than 90 women in the whole village have not participated in production, indicating that the branch's mobilization of women's production is not enough. Preparations are now being made to establish a cotton cooperative to mobilize women to spin and weave.

Second, there is a lack of awareness of saving grain and overcoming famine for a long time. Although each household now has some grain reserves, people like Chen Hongkai, Yang Liancai, and Yang Lianzhi are still wasting food.

Third, appropriate care should still be given to orphans and widows. (Attached picture)

### 杨家板桥支部领导群众治鱼渡荒

　　杨家板桥支部领导群众治鱼渡荒
    唐山地委书记  贺炳章
    地委宣传部长  袁渤
    地委副秘书长  燕英
    河北玉田县杨家板桥村的中共支部，带领全村群众渡过了严重的灾荒。使全村二百零八户九百三十口人的生活大部得到解决，受到了中共唐山地委的表扬。
    杨家板桥村在遭受水灾后群众悲观失望，思想混乱，有的要求发通行证去讨饭；有的计划出外谋生。杨连三、杨王氏等二十余家已断粮；林伶魁家已吃十余天黄菜帮掺?子，把脸都吃肿了；杨尼环已断烟火，躺在炕上，眼看就要饿死。这时全村二百零八户中，已有一百多户一天只吃一顿饭。
    当时支部党员也曾一度混乱，但他们在上级党与政府的号召以及党员为人民服务的思想支配下，经过三、四天的讨论研究，终于想出了生产自救的办法：如治鱼、织席、纺线。因治鱼是大宗，支部就号召群众，买牛皮制衩裤，有的群众实在困难买不起衩裤，支部书记杨文魁、副支部书记杨继瑞，便将自己的皮裤暂借给他们使用。全村就有七八十人，使箔下水治鱼。但是鱼不上箔，大家生活还是没办法，情绪又低落下来。
    这时，支部又召开党员大会，商量生产自救办法。有的谈他们过去如何领导群众纺织生产。有的说过去如何办合作社渡荒。有人提出赶箔治鱼的办法；这个意见立即得到了全体党员的热烈拥护。当时便讨论了赶箔前的准备工作和组织群众治鱼办法。为了鼓励群众治鱼热情，拟出了记工分红办法和奖惩规则。又提出互相借贷的办法，解决群众生产资金困难。
    干部党员就把支部意见拿在村全体干部会议上酝酿讨论，最后大家一致同意。村主席召开全村群众大会，向大家提出了赶箔治鱼的办法，马上得到群众的热烈拥护。这时村主席便号召大家作准备工作，打好苇箔，收拾好家具。这时，有些户提出了家具有困难，支书杨文奎借给杨玉田苇箔两块，麻三斤；副支书杨继瑞借给杨玉盛麻三斤。党员杨继保借给于永海、杨继盛每家箔两块。在他们带头影响下群众中也展开了互借。当时杨廷兴、杨连兴、杨振林、林伶奎等被感动的说：“共产党领导的真好哇？”
    治鱼委员会成立了。选出六名治鱼委员，分设正副主任二人，记帐先生二人，掌科的二人。按劳动力强弱五人编成一组，共三八组。每组选出对治鱼有经验，劳动好的任组长。
    参加治鱼的是一八岁至五五岁的男劳动力。没有劳动力的十岁以上十七岁以下五五岁以外，只要能走的动也可以参加作杂活。一八岁至五五岁的全为整股；一七岁以下五五岁以外的为半个股（劳动好可以加成），全村参加赶箔治鱼的共二百零七人。
    为了发扬群众的生产积极性和避免浪费时间，规定了奖惩办法：（一）半劳动力积极干活可以加成，全劳动力不积极干活的应根据具体情况减成若干。（二）迟到早退不报告组长，按时间长短酌情减粮。每天上工自带小牌，在鱼场交牌，先来先交，散工时也先领牌。（三）在鱼场吵嘴打架妨碍生产酌量减成。
    在治鱼生产中群众生产情绪很高，如十岁的大年、七十八岁的杨庆年和青年小伙子们一样高声喊叫，手脚不闲。于克勤、杨继正等打过两次架，就受到处罚。林芪环二十三岁，不好好干活，当时即提出给他去三成股（当天的），杨凤丛老大爷干的特别起劲，即给他加上三成。这样不但杨凤丛老大爷干的更积极，林芪环也积极了，同时鼓励了全体群众的积极性。再也没有人打架了。
    他们捕鱼很多，有一箔出了八万多斤鱼，卖了一百余石的包米。到现在共赶了六箔共卖一百七十余石，连作鞋纺线绳等，共赚米二百余石。每整股都分到七斗到八斗的粮食。
    但在全村生产自救中也发现了一些偏向，并已提出了改进办法：
    第一，全村还有九十多名妇女没有参加生产，说明了支部对于发动妇女生产是不够的。现已准备成立棉花合作社，发动妇女纺织。
    第二，缺乏节约存粮长期渡荒的思想。虽然现在各家都有了一些存粮，但是像陈宏凯、杨连彩、杨连之等，他们还是“有柴一灶有菜一锅”的在浪费。
    第三，对于孤寡户，尚须适当照顾。（附图片）
