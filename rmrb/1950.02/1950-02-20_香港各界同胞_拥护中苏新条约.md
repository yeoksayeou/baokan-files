Xinhua News Agency, Hong Kong, February 18th: Hong Kong newspapers and compatriots from all walks of life have expressed warm support for the signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance, and Mutual Assistance and other agreements. On February 15th, the second editions of Hong Kong's Wen Wei Po and Ta Kung Pao both published the full text of the treaty and agreements, as well as the speeches by Soviet Foreign Minister Vyshinsky and Chinese Premier and Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai, on the entire front page. They also published the Xinhua News Agency editorial. Hong Kong cultural figures Sima Wensen, Cheng Bugao, Tao Jin, Lin Huanping, Shi Zhaotang, and others unanimously believe that the signing of the new treaty between China and the Soviet Union is the greatest happy event since the founding of the People's Republic of China and should be warmly congratulated. Film workers Su Yi, Gu Er'yi, Zhang Min, and 23 others jointly expressed their feelings, saying: From the content of the treaty, it will enable the Chinese people to receive strong assistance in their journey from the wounds of war to the completion of socialist construction. From the perspective of the treaty's impact, it will cause the warmongers of imperialism and their lackeys to face the end of their tricks, and enable peace-loving people around the world to further fight to defend world peace. Businessmen Huang Changshui and Chen Zubei said in their talks: From the Sino-Soviet treaty signed this time, we can see the great spirit of the Soviet Union's assistance to the people's democratic countries, which is in the strongest contrast to the imperialist aggressive foreign policy.

　　香港各界同胞
    拥护中苏新条约
    【新华社香港十八日电】香港各报和各界同胞对中苏缔结友好同盟互助条约及其他协定表示热烈拥护。十五日香港文汇报和大公报的第二次版均以首页全幅刊登条约及协定的全文和苏联外长维辛斯基及我国周恩来总理兼外长的演讲词，同时并刊登了新华社社论。香港文化界人士司马文森、程步高、陶金、林焕平、石兆堂等一致认为，这次中苏两大国缔结新约是中华人民共和国开国以来的最大喜事，应该热烈祝贺。电影工作者苏怡、顾而已、章泯等二十六人联合发表感想说：从条约的内容上看，它将使中国人民从战争的创伤走向完成新民主主义建设途中获得有力的援助。从条约的影响来看，它将使帝国主义的战争贩子及其走狗面临技穷的地步，使全世界爱好和平的人民更进一步为卫护世界和平而斗争。工商界黄长水、陈祖沛发表谈话说：从这次签订的中苏条约可以看到苏联对人民民主国家援助的伟大精神，和帝国主义的侵略外交政策成了最强烈的对照。
