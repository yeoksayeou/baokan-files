Chahar Province—To assist farmers with preparations for spring plowing, supply and marketing cooperatives in several counties of Chahar Province are adopting the method of signing contracts to organize iron and wood workers in urban and rural areas to produce farm tools in large quantities. Supply and marketing cooperatives in Chanan (Southern Chahar) counties such as Huai'an, Tianzhen, Huailai, and Xuanhua have signed contracts with blacksmith shops to manufacture farm tools according to mutually agreed-upon plans. The Yangyuan County cooperative is systematically supporting blacksmiths, foundry workers, and carpenters in manufacturing triangular seeders, plowshares, and iron shovels. Xuanhua Town has signed contracts with eight lumber mills to produce a total of 440 carts, 90 of which have already been transported to Chahar North. Longguan, Chicheng, Huailai, Yanqing, Xuanhua, and other counties have also purchased 2,500 iron shovels from Hunyuan to supply to farmers. Each county has assigned dedicated personnel to be responsible for the manufacturing and purchasing of farm tools. Banks are providing loans to support iron and wood artisans lacking capital.

The Tianzhen County Supply and Marketing Cooperative, in order to supply farm tools to local farmers, has consulted with Chen Yumei's blacksmith shop in An'dingying Village, Second District of the county, and agreed to customize 128 iron shovels, with a labor cost of ten catties of millet per shovel. The county cooperative will supply the iron (five catties per shovel) and coal (thirty catties per shovel) according to the agreed amount. To ensure that the iron shovels meet the needs of farmers, the county cooperative specifically convened a meeting of village and cooperative directors on January 20th. At the meeting, various iron shovel samples that had already been made were evaluated, and the one that everyone considered the best was designated as the standard sample. The farm tools manufactured by Chen Yumei in accordance with the contract have been very well received by the masses, influencing blacksmiths such as Gao Zhen and Wang Zeng in An'dingying Village to also request to sign contracts with the supply and marketing cooperative to manufacture farm tools. The demand for farm tools from Tianzhen farmers is too great to be met solely by local blacksmith shops. Therefore, the county cooperative has also contacted Zhangjiakou, Chaigoubao, Kouquan, Yuxian, and other places to purchase a large number of farm tools such as shovels, hoes, plows, and plowshares.

The Shangdu County Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Chahar North is also organizing iron and wood cooperatives to rush production of farm tools. In December of last year, the cooperative organized iron and wood artisans in the city to prepare for the establishment of an iron and wood cooperative, and the county cooperative plans to provide the cooperative with 7,000 catties of iron and 10 shi of millet as capital. The business operating policy of the iron and wood cooperative is to manufacture farm tools according to the seasonal needs of farmers, ensuring that agricultural timing is not missed.

The Datong City branch of the People's Bank of China issued a loan of 10 million yuan to support the Datong City Iron Industry Cooperative in manufacturing farm tools. According to the seasonal needs of farmers, the cooperative plans to manufacture spring plowing tools such as iron shovels and hoes, as well as tools for transporting manure and opening ditches in the first quarter of this year; summer weeding tools, mainly hoe blades, in the second quarter; and autumn harvesting tools, mainly sickles, in the third quarter. The Yanbei Supply and Marketing Cooperative has already signed a contract with the general cooperative to order 2,500 iron shovels. The Datong City Garrison Force has also signed a contract with the cooperative to exchange iron for farm tools, ordering 2,000 iron shovels and 500 hoes.

There are two methods used by counties in Chahar Province this year to supply farmers with production tools: 1. Adopting the method of signing contracts with iron and wood cooperatives or blacksmith shops to uniformly supply raw materials and uniformly promote the sales of farm tools. 2. Supply and marketing cooperatives sign contracts with other supply and marketing cooperatives to transfer surplus farm tools from one area to another area lacking farm tools, promoting the exchange of industrial and agricultural tools between regions. This method of signing contracts has the following five benefits: 1. Under a unified plan, planned production and sales can be carried out; 2. Manufacturing according to farmers' required standards allows products to meet specifications; 3. Delivery is made according to the seasonal needs of farmers, without missing agricultural timing; 4. Regional adjustments can promote the spread of superior farm tools; 5. Dispersed handicraft production can be organized to serve agricultural production in a planned way.

　　察省不少县供销社组织铁木工人订立合同  赶造农具帮助农民春耕
    【本报讯】察省若干县供销社采取订立合同办法，组织城乡铁木工人，大量制造农具，帮助农民准备春耕。察南怀安、天镇、怀来、宣化等县供销社已分别和铁匠炉订立合同，按照双方同意的计划制造农具。阳原县社有计划地扶助铁匠、翻砂工人和木工，制造三角耧、犁铧、铁锨。宣化镇已和八处木工厂订立了合同，共制出大车四百四十辆，已运往察北九十辆。龙关、赤城、怀来、延庆、宣化等县，又从浑源购回铁锨二千五百把，供应农民使用。各县派有专人负责制造与购买农具。银行贷款扶助缺乏资金的铁木匠人。
    天镇县供销社为供给当地农民农具，已与该县二区安定营村陈玉美铁匠炉商妥，定制铁锨一二八张，每张铁锨的工费为十斤小米。制锨的铁（每张五斤）煤（每张三十斤）由县社按数供给。为使铁锨切合农民需用，一月二十日县社特召开各村社主任会议。在会上评定已做好的各种铁锨样本，将大家认为最好的一种定为标准样本。陈玉美按照合同规定制造的农具大受群众欢迎，影响安定营村铁匠高珍、王增等也都要求与供销社订立合同，制造农具。天镇农民需要农具太多，单靠本地铁匠炉制造不及，该县县社又向张家口、柴沟堡、口泉、蔚县等地接洽，采购锨、镐、犁、铧等大批农具。
    察北商都县供销社也组织铁木合作社赶制农具。该社于去年十二月在城里组织铁木工匠筹办了一个铁木合作社，县社准备贷给该社七千斤铁及十石小米为资本。铁木合作社的业务经营方针是按农民的季节需要制造农具，保证不误农时。
    人民银行大同市营业部发放贷款一千万元扶持大同市铁业合作社制造农具。该社根据农民季节需要，计划在今年第一季制春耕农具如铁锨、洋镐以及送粪、开渠的用具；第二季制夏锄农具，以锄板为主；第三季制秋收农具，以镰刀为主。现雁北供销社已与总社订立合同，订购铁锨二千五百张。大同市警备部队亦与该社订立以铁换农具的合同，订制铁锨二千张、洋镐五百件。
    察省各县今年供应农民生产工具的办法有两种：一、采用与铁木合作社或铁匠炉订合同的办法，统一供给原料，统一推销农具。二、由供销社与供销社订合同，把某一地区多余农具调剂给缺乏农具的另一地区，促进了各地区间农工业用具的交换。此种订立合同的办法，有以下五种好处：一、在统一计划下，可以进行有计划的生产和推销；二、按照农民要求标准制造，产品可达到规格化；三、按照农民的季节需要交货，不误农时；四、地区与地区调剂，可以推广优良农具。五、并可将分散的手工业生产组织起来，有计划地为农业生产服务。
