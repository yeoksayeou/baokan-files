Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, February 22nd. The people of Northeast China have supplied a large amount of surplus grain to various parts of the country in the past year, powerfully supporting the military and civilian food needs of the interior. According to statistics, from last April to recently, the grain entering customs has reached more than 854,000 tons. Due to land reform and the great production movement in the rural areas of Northeast China, the enthusiasm of farmers for production has reached an unprecedented high, and output has also greatly increased. Although individual areas suffered poor harvests last year, grain production is still sufficient throughout the region, so a large portion of surplus grain can be put on the market. After last April, most parts of the country were liberated, and transportation between Northeast China and the interior became more frequent. Under the unified dispatch of the Financial and Economic Committee of the Northeast People's Government and the Central People's Government, the surplus grain from Northeast China began to flow into the interior. The proportion of this grain in the total amount of commercial grain circulating has also greatly increased. According to statistics from April to December last year, 31.7 percent of the total amount of commercial grain circulating in the entire Northeast was transported to the interior. Among them, the grain transported to the interior from April to June (second quarter) accounted for 21.3 percent of the total amount of commercial grain circulating in that quarter, while the grain transported to the interior from October to December (fourth quarter) increased to 52.9 percent. This year, the Central People's Government plans to transport 41 percent of the total commercial grain in Northeast China to the interior to regulate the grain consumption of the people in the interior and support the People's Liberation Army in the rapid liberation of Taiwan, Tibet, and Hainan Island. The plan to transport 320,000 tons of grain to the interior in January and February has been completed half a month ahead of schedule, exceeding the task by more than 18,500 tons, and the new grain transportation task in March is also being actively carried out.

　　东北十个月来粮食入关
    总额超过八十五万吨
    今年决再增运入关支援解放台湾西藏等地
    【新华社沈阳二十二日电】东北人民过去一年来以大批剩余粮食供应关内各地，有力地支援了关内的军需民食。据统计自去年四月到最近止，入关粮食已达八十五万四千余吨。东北农村由于经过了土地改革和大生产运动，农民生产情绪空前高涨，产量亦大为提高，去年个别地区虽曾歉收，但在全境范围内粮食产量仍较充足，因此尚有大部分剩余粮食可投入市场。去年四月以后，关内各地大部解放，东北与关内的交通运输日渐频繁，在东北人民政府财政经济委员会和中央人民政府统一调度下，东北剩余粮食即开始源源入关，在全部周转的商品粮食中，所占的比重亦大为增加。据去年四月至十二月间的统计，在全东北周转的商品粮食总数中即有百分之三十一点七运往关内，其中四月到六月（第二季度）运往关内的粮食占该季度周转的商品粮食总数的百分之二十一点三，十月至十二月（第四季度）运往关内的粮食则增加到百分之五十二点九。今年度中央人民政府计划将东北全部商品粮总数的百分之四十一运往关内，调剂关内人民用粮，并支援人民解放军迅速解放台湾、西藏、海南岛。现一、二两月份运往关内三十二万吨粮食的计划已提前半月完成，并超过任务一万八千五百余吨，三月份新的运粮任务亦正在积极进行中。
