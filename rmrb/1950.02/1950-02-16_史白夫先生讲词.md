Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 15th: Mr. Spivak, Chargé d'Affaires of the Soviet Embassy in China, said in his speech at the banquet tonight: Dear friends,

　　Today, the people of the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China, as well as peace-loving people all over the world, are jointly celebrating a great event of world historical significance: that is, yesterday in Moscow, the governments of the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China signed the Treaty of Friendship, Alliance, and Mutual Assistance, as well as the Agreement on the Chinese Changchun Railway, Port Arthur, and Dalian, and the Agreement on a Soviet Loan to the People's Republic of China. The aforementioned treaties and agreements have opened a new page in the history of friendly relations between the two great nations of China and the Soviet Union; it is a great new contribution to the cause of consolidating international peace and the democratic camp; and it is also a great practical proof of the lofty principles of the foreign policy of the Soviet socialist country. The founder of this foreign policy was Lenin and Stalin, the great leaders of the Soviet people and the working people of the world.

　　The treaties and agreements mentioned above once again specifically demonstrate to the world that the basic principles of Soviet foreign policy are: respecting the sovereignty of all countries, large and small, and all nations, large and small, and providing fraternal assistance to the working people of the world who are fighting for their freedom, national independence, peace, and democracy.

　　The treaties and agreements signed in Moscow are a head-on blow to the reactionary camp and warmongers around the world, to all enemies of the Soviet and Chinese people, to those who attempt to spread distrust of the Soviet Union and its Stalinist foreign policy, to those who attempt to use foul language and slander to smear the Soviet foreign policy and undermine the friendship between the people of China and the Soviet Union. The treaties and agreements signed in Moscow are the best answer to the conspiracies of our common enemies.

　　The Soviet people and their great leaders Lenin and Stalin have always stood on the side of the great Chinese people in their feelings and thoughts. They knew with confidence that the day would soon come when the forces of the Chinese democratic revolution would defeat the dark forces of reaction at home and abroad. And now the great day of victory for the Chinese people's great liberation movement has arrived. Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao Zedong, the leader of the Chinese people, the Chinese people have removed the shackles of feudalism and imperialist oppression from themselves and established the free and independent People's Republic of China.

　　However, after defeating the Kuomintang bandits and establishing the People's Republic of China, the Chinese people encountered serious difficulties in economic construction. Due to years of arduous and bloody resistance against the Japanese invaders, the Kuomintang reactionaries, and foreign imperialist forces, and because the Kuomintang reactionaries and foreign imperialists had always ruled China for twenty-seven years, China was in a state of economic decline. And this time, the Soviet people and the Soviet government once again extended a helping hand to the Chinese people. The Soviet people, the Soviet government, and Comrade Stalin decided to give the Chinese people sincere fraternal assistance and help the Chinese people quickly restore their destroyed economy.

　　The consolidation of the friendship between the people of China and the Soviet Union is the consolidation of the peace and democracy camp in the world. This is why the signing of treaties and agreements between China and the Soviet Union in Moscow is not only a great festival for the people of China and the Soviet Union, but also for all peace-loving people in the world, and for all people striving for national independence, freedom, peace, and democracy.

　　Long live the unbreakable friendship and close cooperation between the great people of China and the Soviet Union!
　　Long live the great Chinese people and Chairman Mao Zedong, the leader of the Chinese people and Chairman of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China!
　　Long live Comrade Stalin, the leader and teacher of the working people of the world and the best friend of the Chinese people!

　　史白夫先生讲词
    【新华社北京十五日电】苏联驻我国大使馆代办史白夫在今晚宴会上的演讲词：亲爱的朋友们：
    今天苏联和中华人民共和国的人民以及全世界爱好和平的人民共同来庆祝有全世界历史意义的伟大的事件：这就是昨天在莫斯科，苏联和中华人民共和国政府签定了友好同盟互助条约，以及关于中国长春铁路、旅顺口及大连的协定和苏联贷款给中华人民共和国的协定。上面所述的条约和协定展开了中苏两大民族之间友好关系历史上的新一页；是巩固国际和平和民主阵营事业的伟大的新贡献；又是苏维埃社会主义国家外交政策崇高原则的伟大的实际证明。这种外交政策的创立者是苏联人民和全世界劳动者的伟大领袖列宁和斯大林。
    上述的条约和协定又一次具体地对全世界说明苏联外交政策的基本原则是：尊重大小国家和大小民族的主权以及给予那些在为自己的自由、民族独立、和平与民主而斗争的，全世界劳动者以兄弟般的援助。
    在莫斯科签订的条约和协定，对于全世界反动阵营及战争贩子，对于苏联和中国人民的一切敌人，对于那些企图散布对苏联及其斯大林外交政策的不信任的敌人，对那些企图用秽词滥调来含血喷人地污蔑苏联外交政策并破坏中苏两国人民友谊的敌人，予以迎头痛击。在莫斯科签订的条约和协定乃是对我们共同敌人的阴谋的一个最好的答复。
    苏联人民及其伟大领袖列宁和斯大林在自己的感情和思想上，永远站在伟大中国人民的这一方面。他们曾满怀信心地知道：中国的民主革命力量战胜国内外反动黑暗势力的那一天很快就会到来。而现在中国人民伟大解放运动胜利的这一伟大的日子已经来到了。中国人民在中国共产党和中国人民领袖毛泽东主席领导之下，从自己身上解除了封建主义和帝国主义压迫的枷锁，并创立了自由独立的中华人民共和国。
    但是中国人民在战胜了国民党匪帮和创立了中华人民共和国之后，在经济建设上却遇到了严重的困难。由于多年来对日本侵略者、对国民党反动派和外国帝国主义势力的艰苦流血抗战，由于国民党反动派和外国帝国主义者二十七年来一向统治着中国，遂使中国陷于经济衰落的境地，而苏联人民和苏联政府这一次又向中国人民伸出援助之手。苏联人民、苏联政府和斯大林同志决定给中国人民以忠诚的兄弟般的援助，并帮助中国人民迅速地恢复被破坏了的经济。
    中苏两国人民之间友谊的巩固乃是全世界和平与民主阵营的巩固。这就是为什么苏中两国在莫斯科签订条约和协定，不但对于中苏人民，而且对于全世界一切爱好和平的人民，对于一切争取民族独立、自由、和平与民主的人民，乃是一个伟大的节日。
    伟大的中苏两国人民之间永固不破的友谊和紧密的合作万岁！
    伟大的中国人民和中国人民领袖、中华人民共和国中央人民政府主席毛泽东万岁！
    全世界劳动者的领袖和导师，中国人民的最好朋友斯大林同志万岁！
