Xinhua Bookstore Beijing Branch
　　Spring Festival Organizes Mobile Teams to Promote New Year Pictures, Well-Received
[Our Newspaper] During the Spring Festival holiday, the Beijing branch of Xinhua Bookstore went deep into the masses to promote New Year pictures. The first mobile team was set up in the venue of the National New Year Picture Exhibition in Zhongshan Park. The second mobile team was set up in Changdian. Both teams were very well received by the masses. The audience could freely visit, choose, and buy. Most of the buyers were women and children; some children used the money they had for firecrackers to buy New Year pictures. They said: Xinhua Bookstore is everywhere; it comes whenever there is an event, truly serving the people! Regarding the content of the New Year pictures, the reflection is: Now the New Year pictures all depict real events, national affairs, and our lives. The care of the masses also educated the comrades who participated in the mobile team. They felt the joy and glory of serving the people, and therefore decided to go all out during the last two days of the holiday, in coordination with the publicity of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance, to sell books and periodicals related to Sino-Soviet relations.
