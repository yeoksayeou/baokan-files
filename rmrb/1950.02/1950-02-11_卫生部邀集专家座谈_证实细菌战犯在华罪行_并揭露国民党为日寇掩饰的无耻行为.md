Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, February 10th: The Ministry of Health of the Central People's Government held a symposium on the crimes of Japanese bacterial warfare criminals in China on the 8th. At the meeting, experts who personally participated in the prevention and control work confirmed that Japanese war criminals did indeed drop plague bacteria in Zhejiang, Hunan, and Fujian, and also exposed the Kuomintang reactionaries' shameless behavior of covering up for the Japanese invaders. Speakers at the meeting also proved that the Japanese invaders manufactured plague bacteria in Beijing and used bacteria in combat in Hebei.

Chen Wanli, former Director of the Health Department of Zhejiang Province, said at the meeting: In 1940, the plague occurred in Ningbo. In November of the same year, the plague was discovered in Quzhou. Both were directly caused after enemy planes dropped cotton and wheat mixed with fleas, and both had been scientifically tested and fully confirmed. Five people who worked with me at the time reported to the Chongqing Kuomintang government. The Kuomintang government also sent an investigation team (including an Austrian consultant, who was later confirmed to be a spy), but this investigation team completely ignored the results of our investigation and testing, believing that the Japanese use of bacteria was absolutely untrue. The Kuomintang government also unreasonably accused us of exaggerating and fabricating stories to disturb the public and even publicly published articles scolding the five of us who made the report. At that time, we were very angry and indignant and deeply grieved for the compatriots who died of the plague. Last year, during the Soviet trial of Japanese bacterial warfare criminals, the time listed in the confessions of the criminals coincided exactly with the time we discovered at that time.

Zhu Shaohuang, who was one of the heads of the Kuomintang investigation team at the time, reflected at the meeting. He said: When we were about to depart from Chongqing for the investigation, the person in charge of health affairs of the puppet government repeatedly told us to follow the instructions of the Austrian consultant and told us to have our own opinions and not to lightly believe the reports from below. Later, our investigation report was written in a very evasive manner, and we did not dare to be sure that the Japanese used bacteria to poison our compatriots. Zhu Shaohuang read the investigation report at the time at the meeting and apologized to Chen Wanli and the health workers who participated in the work at that time.

Shi Qiao, of the Health Department of the 205th Division, said: In 1942, the Japanese invaders released a large number of rats carrying pathogens in the southern part of Ding County in the Seventh Military District of central Hebei. Fortunately, our health authorities discovered it early and took strict preventive measures, and the plague did not spread. At that time, the enemy and us advanced and retreated frequently. In every area swept by the enemy, epidemics were bound to occur, the most common being relapsing fever. We speculated that the enemy was using bacterial warfare. In the spring of 1942, our army captured Major General Oomoto Seisho, the head of a Japanese special service agency in China, in central Hebei, which fully confirmed our speculation. Oomoto confessed that the Japanese army was equipped with bacteria, including plague, typhoid, cholera, and other bacteria, and could release them as long as there was an order. At that time, because the situation in central Hebei was complicated, bacteria were not used on a large scale, and bacterial warfare tactics would only be used extensively when the Eighth Route Army was compressed into the mountains or when the Japanese army withdrew.

Tang Feifan, Director of the Temple of Heaven Epidemic Prevention Department, said: I took over the Temple of Heaven Epidemic Prevention Department from the Japanese in the winter of 1945. At that time, I asked if there were any important strains of bacteria, and they said no. This year, we specifically set up a strain room in our department to centrally store all the strains from the past. At this time, it was found that there were six tubes of strains that did not indicate the type, and only a Japanese woman's name was written on each tube. These days, we have specially cultured these strains and found that they are all plague bacteria with high virulence. This shows that the Japanese secretly manufactured plague bacteria in Beijing at that time.

Minister Li Dequan reminded the medical community to be vigilant at the meeting. She said: In the past, not enough attention was paid to this aspect. We must be vigilant at all times. Imperialism does not hesitate to use all kinds of methods to poison our people.

Finally, Vice Minister He Cheng spoke, saying: This issue has taught us that science cannot transcend class or politics. If it is in the hands of imperialist reactionaries, it will become something that endangers the people. This inspires us that only scientists who stand on the side of the people are good scientists. Vice Minister He also explained that the Japanese invaders' use of bacterial warfare, the Kuomintang's cover-up of Japanese crimes, and the US government's refusal to try bacterial warfare criminals prove that they are all enemies of the Chinese people.

At the symposium, everyone expressed great indignation at the crimes of the Japanese invaders and the shameless behavior of the Kuomintang reactionaries and unanimously supported the Soviet Union's just statement demanding the trial of Japanese bacterial warfare criminals headed by Hirohito.

### 卫生部邀集专家座谈  证实细菌战犯在华罪行  并揭露国民党为日寇掩饰的无耻行为

　　卫生部邀集专家座谈
    证实细菌战犯在华罪行       
    并揭露国民党为日寇掩饰的无耻行为
    【新华社北京十日电】中央人民政府卫生部于八日举行的关于日本细菌战犯在华罪行的座谈会。会上，亲自参加防治工作的专家证实了日本战犯确曾在浙江、湖南、福建各地投掷鼠疫细菌，也揭露了国民党反动派替日寇作掩饰的无耻行为。会上发言者又证明日寇曾在北京制造鼠疫细菌和在冀中使用细菌作战。
    前浙江省卫生处长陈万里在会上说：一九四○年宁波发生鼠疫，同年十一月衢州发现鼠疫，都是在敌机投掷混杂跳蚤的棉花、麦子等物件之后直接引起的，都曾经科学检验完全证实。当时和我共同工作的五个人曾向重庆国民党政府作报告。国民党政府还派来了一个考察团（其中有一个奥国顾问，后来证实是间谍），但这个考察团完全忽视我们调查检验的结果，认为日本使用细菌的事绝对不真实。国民党政府也无理地指责我们是夸大捏造、扰乱人心，还公开发表文章大骂我们五个作报告的人。当时我们非常气愤不平，也深为千百染疫而死的同胞含冤。去年苏联审讯日本细菌战犯时，该犯等口供所列举的时间和我们当时发现的时间完全相符。
    当时任该国民党考察团负责人之一的祝绍煌，在会上作了反省。他说：当我们要由重庆出发考察时，伪政府卫生方面的负责人曾再三叮嘱我们，要我们听从奥国顾问的指示，并告诉我们要自有主见，不可轻信下面的报告。后来我们的考察报告就写得八面玲珑，没有敢肯定是日本人使用细菌毒害我国同胞。祝绍煌在会上读了当时的考察报告，并向陈万里及当时参加工作的卫生工作人员认错。
    二○五师卫生部石桥说：一九四二年日寇曾在冀中七分区定县南部放过大批带病源的老鼠。幸我卫生机关发现尚早，防治严密，未流行鼠疫。当时敌我进退频繁，在每次敌人扫荡过的地区，必有流行病发生，最多的是回归热。我们就推测是敌人使用细菌战。四二年春天，我军在冀中捕获了一名日本在华特务机关长大本青少将，完全证实我们的推测。大本供出：日本军队都有细菌装备，鼠疫、伤寒、霍乱等细菌都有，只要有命令就可施放。当时因为冀中犬牙交错，所以没有大规模用细菌，只等把八路军压缩到山里或者日本军队撤退的时候就要大量使用细菌战术。
    天坛防疫处处长汤飞凡说：天坛防疫处是我于一九四五年冬天从日本人手接收过来的，当时查问有没有什么重要的菌种，他们说没有。今年我们处里特别设立一个菌种室，把从前所有的菌种都集中保管。这时发现有六管菌种没有注明种类，只在每个管子上写着一个日本女人的名字。这几天我们特别把这些菌种加以培养，发现都是毒力很大的鼠疫细菌。这说明日本人当时是在北京秘密制造过鼠疫细菌。
    李德全部长在会上提示医学界的人员要提高警惕。她说：以前在这方面的注意是不够的。我们要时刻警惕，帝国主义是不惜用各种各样的方法来毒害我们人民的。
    最后贺诚副部长讲话，他说：这一问题教训了我们，科学是不可能超阶级、超政治的。它如果掌握在帝国主义反动派的手里，就会成为危害人民的东西。这启示我们只有站在人民立场的科学家才是好的科学家。贺副部长并说明：日寇的使用细菌战、国民党的掩饰日本罪行、美国政府的拒绝审判细菌战犯，证明它们都是与中国人民为敌的。
    座谈会上一致对日寇的罪行及国民党反动派的无耻行为表示了极大的愤慨，一致拥护苏联要求审讯以裕仁为首的日本细菌战犯的正义声明。
