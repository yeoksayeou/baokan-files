Undemocratic British Electoral System

February 23rd is the date of the British general election. The British electoral system is one of the most undemocratic in the world. The House of Lords is not elected at all; it is hereditary, consisting of royalty, lords, and archbishops. In the election of the House of Commons, the people's right to free elections is severely restricted. The first is the so-called "one person per district" system, which stipulates that each district elects a representative by a relative majority, and the votes obtained by other candidates are rendered entirely invalid, even if they differ from the winning candidate by only one vote. Under this system, more powerful groups deprive many voters of their representation. For example, in the last general election, the Labour Party won slightly less than 48 percent of the total votes but obtained slightly more than 61 percent of the seats.

The second important restriction is that each candidate must pay a deposit of 150 pounds when registering to run for election, which is equivalent to the annual income of a low-wage worker. If the election results show that the candidate received less than one-eighth of the votes, this deposit is confiscated. In addition, each candidate must prepare at least 500 pounds for campaign expenses. These measures are a great restriction for political parties with more financial difficulties, because they cannot nominate many candidates to participate in the election if they cannot afford a large amount of funds. Taking the Communist Party as an example, it could only nominate 23 candidates in the last general election, and this time it can nominate at most 100. The Conservative Party and the Labour Party, backed by large capital, have nominated more than 600 candidates. In constituencies without Communist Party candidates, many progressive voters are effectively deprived of their right to free elections. If they do not want to vote for reactionary party candidates, they have to abstain. The number of such abstentions is usually very large. Sometimes, in constituencies without Communist Party candidates, voters cross out the names of all reactionary party candidates on the ballot and write "I vote for the Communist Party."

Elections are also subject to age and occupational restrictions. British conscription law stipulates that 18 is the age of service for citizens, but the election law stipulates that only citizens over the age of 21 have the right to vote and be elected. In this way, millions of young people between the ages of 18 and 21 are deprived of the right to vote, and this group of young people tends to be more progressive in their thinking. The law stipulates that public officials may not participate in elections and must resign from their positions if they want to run for election. This effectively eliminates the right to be elected for hundreds of thousands of public officials. The same goes for hundreds of thousands of soldiers, who are even prohibited from participating in any political activities. Not to mention the tens of millions of colonial people.

In addition to the above-mentioned restrictions, mention must be made of propaganda activities and discrimination in elections. Except for the British Communist Party's "Daily Worker" and a few progressive publications, the country's propaganda weapons are in the hands of large capitalist groups. More than 20 million newspapers, thousands of publications, the national broadcasting network and television stations, including the official British Information Service and the semi-official British Broadcasting Corporation, distort facts, cover up the truth, deceive the people, and slander democratic and progressive forces every day. There are also many cinemas, theaters, churches, etc., which often instill poison into voters. The Communist Party's propaganda activities are subject to discrimination everywhere. There are many examples. For example, under the monopoly of large capitalist groups, the campaign broadcast time allocated to the Communist Party before this election was only ten minutes, and it was arranged at a time when workers were busy working and could not listen, using ten minutes to decorate British "democracy." For example, the Labour government announced on the 2nd of this month that political marches were prohibited in London for three months. The intention is obvious: before the general election, the working people in London are not allowed to conduct large-scale propaganda demonstrations to support the British Communist Party's election platform. For example, many places in London and other big cities that are available for public gatherings often refuse to allow the Communist Party to convene conferences and deliver campaign speeches to the elected officials, etc., under various excuses.

Finally, the adjustment of electoral districts this time also contains conspiracies. The purpose of the adjustment is to abolish the constituencies where the British Communist Party and other progressive candidates have a relatively good chance of winning, to merge or divide them into constituencies where conservative forces are dominant, or to expand them, so as to reduce the proportion of progressive forces among voters, so as to affect the outcome of the election. In other words, it is to make it as difficult as possible for the British Communist Party and other progressive candidates to lose the opportunity to be elected. At the same time, because the quota of voters in rural areas is generally smaller than that in urban areas, and rural areas are generally more backward than urban areas, and the organization of political activities requires more material conditions. This time, the redistribution of urban and rural constituencies is to give more conservative areas a larger proportion of representation.

The undemocratic nature of the British electoral system is roughly like this. (Xinhua News Agency)

### 不民主的英国选举制度

　　不民主的英国选举制度
    二月二十三日是英国的大选日。英国的选举制度是世界上最不民主的选举制度之一。上院根本是不选举的，那里由皇族、勋爵、大主教世袭。在下院的选举中，人民自由选举的权利受到极大的限制。首先就是所谓一区一人制度，规定每区按比较多数当选，而其他候选人所得的选票，即使与当选者只有一票之差，也等于全部作废。在这个制度之下，较有权势的集团，剥夺了许多选民的代表权。例如在上次大选中，工党得票占总数的百分之四十八弱，却获得百分之六十一强的议席。
    第二种重要限制是每个候选人登记竞选时，须先缴付一百五十镑的保证金，这等于一个低薪工人的全年工资收入。如果选举揭晓，得票不到八分之一，这笔保证金就被没收。此外，每一候选人至少须准备五百镑的竞选费用。这些办法对于经济比较困难的党派是很大的限制，因为不能负担大量的经费，就不能提出很多候选人参加竞选。以共产党为例，上次大选时只能提出二十三个候选人，这次最多也只能提出一百人。而有大资本做靠山的保守党和工党，则都提了六百名以上的候选人。在没有共产党候选人的选区，不少进步的选民实际上被剥夺了自由的选举权。他们如果不愿投反动党派候选人的票，就只好弃权。这种弃权的数目通常是很大的。有的时候，在没有共产党候选人的选区，选民在选票上涂去了所有反动党派候选人的名字，而写上“我投共产党的票”。
    选举还有年龄和职业的限制。英国征兵法规定十八岁为公民的服役年龄，但选举法却规定二十一岁以上的公民才有选举和被选举权。这样，成百万十八岁以上二十一岁以下的青年就被剥夺了选举权，而这一批青年，往往是思想比较进步的。法律规定公职人员不得参加竞选，要竞选就必须辞去职务。这种办法实际上取消了数十万公职人员的被选举权。数十万的士兵也是一样，他们甚至被禁止参加任何政治活动。更不用说成千万的殖民地人民了。
    在上述几种限制之外，必须提到选举中的宣传活动和歧视问题。除了英共的《工人日报》及少数进步刊物之外，全国的宣传武器都操在大资本集团的手里。每天二千余万份的报纸，上千种的刊物，全国的广播网和电视站，包括官方的英国新闻处及半官方的英国广播公司在内，都天天在歪曲事实，掩盖真相，欺骗人民，诬蔑民主进步力量。还有许许多多的电影院、剧院、教堂等，也经常为选民灌输毒素。而共产党的宣传活动，则处处受到歧视。例子是很多的。例如：在大资本集团的垄断下，这次大选前分配给共产党的竞选广播时间，统共只有十分钟，并被安排在工人忙于工作无法收听的时间，以十分钟里来装饰英国的“民主”。又如：工党政府于本月二日宣布伦敦区禁止政治游行三个月，其用意很明显，就是在大选以前，不准伦敦区的劳动人民进行大规模的宣传示威运动，来拥护英共的竞选纲领。又如伦敦及其它大城市许多可供公共集会的场所，常以各种借口，拒绝供共产党召集大会，向民选发表竞选演说等等。
    最后，关于这次选区的调整，同样也包藏着阴谋。调整的目的，就是把英共及其他进步候选人比较有获胜把握的选区予以取消，使归并或分割至保守力量占优势的选区，或者予以扩大，使选民中进步力量的比重减低，以影响选举的结果。换一句话说，就是要尽可能使英共及其他进步的候选人失去当选的机会。同时由于乡村区的选民比额一般较城市区为小，而乡村区又一般较城市区落后，居住分散，组织政治活动需要更多物质条件。这次，重新划分城乡选区，就是使比较保守的地区得到较大比例的代表权。
    英国选举制度的不民主，大体就是如此。          （新华社）
