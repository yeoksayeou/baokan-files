Under the initiation of the CCP branch, the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association branch, and the Youth League branch, the National Hui People's College held a celebration forum on the morning of February 16th, attended by more than 200 teachers, students, and staff. At the meeting, all the teachers and students spoke enthusiastically, expressing their support for the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance and its various agreements.

The meeting adjourned amidst loud slogans.

Municipal No. 3 Middle School convened a celebration forum on the afternoon of February 15th.

    热诚拥护中苏新条约
    辅仁大学和中央戏剧学校十五日晚正举行联欢会。当辅大柴德赓先生报告这一消息时，全场一千多人，立刻报以长久的大鼓掌。中央戏剧学校校长欧阳予倩先生说：“专门造谣的帝国主义，又一次失败了。中苏友好同盟互助条约，使世界持久和平得到了保障。”师大学生会为了表示对中苏缔约的热诚拥护，昨日并发出通电。
    国立回民学院在中共支部、中苏友协支会及青年团支部发起下于十六日上午举行庆祝座谈会，到会师生员工二百余人。会上全体师生纷纷发言，都表示拥护中苏友好同盟互助条约及其各项协定，并且一致认为这一条约的签订，不仅表现了中苏间的真正友谊，即是个人思想上的模糊认识，这一下也澄清了。大会在高呼口号声中散会。
    市立三中于十五日下午就召开了庆祝座谈会。陈章焕同学特别提出：过去特务的造谣，已被这铁的事实粉碎了。大家都一致认为过去有些对中苏问题有怀疑的人现在不用再解释了。
    【本报讯】京市自来水公司职工昨天（十六日）早晨学习中苏新条约、新协定，大家一致拥护，认为苏联真是我们的好朋友。京市一区区委会、区政府、工会、分局等机关，也于十六日上午学习并热烈讨论了中苏友好同盟互助条约等。北京电业局工会决定在春节后展开学习。前门的第二人民教育馆用大播音器向行人播送这些条约和协定的内容，并在箭楼底下用黑板写出条约和协定的全文。
