Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 13th: TASS Moscow, 12th: An "Izvestia" commentator writes: American imperialists, stubbornly trying to continue their policy of aggression against the people of Asia, have apparently not changed their attitude because of the failure of their policy toward China. The recent conspiracies of American imperialism in the Far East prove this.

Before the American imperialists failed in China, they said they wanted to use occupied Japan as the "industrial workshop of Asia," that is, as a tool for their economic enslavement of Asian countries; now, after their failure in China, they openly declare that their plan is to turn Japan into their military springboard and supplier of cannon fodder. American military representatives are constantly pouring into the Japanese islands. According to foreign newspapers, even Jessup, a civilian official of the State Department and a special representative of the United States to international conferences, specifically consulted with MacArthur on issues of great military importance during his recent visit to Japan. Representatives of the American imperialists regard Japan as a military bridgehead for their Far Eastern policy of aggression. Bradley and his entourage inspected the naval bases of Yokosuka and Sasebo as if these bases were somewhere on the west coast of the United States. The chiefs of staff are drafting plans to allow US troops to remain in Japan even after a peace treaty has been signed, and to permanently retain bases such as Yokosuka for use by the American armed forces.

The aggressive policy of the United States has encouraged the Japanese reactionaries to engage in unrestrained revanchist propaganda. In the past, the hiding places of Japanese revanchism were semi-underground fascist and nationalist organizations; now, Japanese revanchism has become an openly declared official policy of the Japanese reactionaries. Japanese Prime Minister Yoshida's recent remarks in parliament, attempting to seek revenge, are a direct consequence of the policy pursued by American imperialism in Japan.

The commentator concludes: But no matter how hard the American imperialists try, they cannot contain the national liberation movement of the people of Asian countries. The attempt by the American ruling clique to gain the support of the defeated Japanese imperialists, who are hated by all the people of Asia, further exposes the current imperialist policy of the United States in the Far East, and this policy will inevitably suffer an unavoidable failure.

　　美帝阴谋变日本为侵略基地  帝国主义政策必将遭受失败
    消息报评美帝在远东阴谋活动
    【新华社北京十三日电】塔斯社莫斯科十二日讯：消息报评论员写道：顽固地力图继续对亚洲人民执行侵略政策的美国帝国主义者，显然没有因为他们的对华政策的失败而改变他们的态度。美国帝国主义最近在远东的各种阴谋证明了这一点。
    当美国帝国主义者在中国失败之前，他们说要利用被占领的日本作为“亚洲的工业工场”，即作为他们在经济上奴役亚洲国家的工具；目前，当他们在中国失败之后，他们公然宣布，他们的计划是要把日本变为他们的军事跳板和炮灰供应地。美国的军事代表正不断的涌入日本各岛。据外国报纸的消息，甚至国务院的文官、美国出席国际会议的特别代表耶塞普，在他最近访问日本的时候，也和麦克阿瑟专门磋商了具有重要军事性的问题。美帝国主义者的代表们认为日本是他们远东侵略政策的军事桥头堡垒。布莱德雷一行视察了横须贺与佐世保的海军基地，就好像这些基地是在美国西部海岸的什么地方似的。参谋长们正在拟定计划，以便使美军甚至在和约已经签订时仍驻留日本，并且永远保留横须贺之类的基地，以供美国武装部队使用。
    美国的侵略政策鼓励了日本反动分子肆无忌惮的复仇主义的宣传。从前，日本复仇主义的藏身处是法西斯主义与民族主义的半地下组织，如今，日本复仇主义已成为日本反动派公然宣布的官方方针了。日本首相吉田最近在议会中发表的企图复仇的言论，便是美帝国主义在日本所奉行的政策的直接后果。
    评论员结语称：但是，不论美帝国主义者怎样费尽心机，他们也是遏止不了亚洲各国人民的民族解放运动的。美国统治集团企图获得亚洲全体人民所痛恨的、被击溃了的日本帝国主义者的支持，这种企图，更进一步地暴露了美国目前在远东的帝国主义政策，而这种政策必将遭受不可避免的失败。
