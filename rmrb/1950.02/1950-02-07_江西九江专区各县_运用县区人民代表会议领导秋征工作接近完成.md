　　Jiangxi Jiujiang Special District Counties
    Utilize County and District People's Representative Meetings
    To Lead Autumn Grain Collection Work, Approaching Completion
    [From this newspaper] The autumn grain collection work in various counties of the Jiujiang Special District in Jiangxi is nearing completion, and the collection of remaining arrears is currently underway. The district began its autumn grain collection in early December last year. The broad masses of farmers demonstrated a high degree of patriotic enthusiasm, and by around the 24th of last month, the amount of public grain stored in each county (including the number of summer grain loans used for offsetting) had reached more than 80 percent of the total public grain. Among them, Jiujiang and Ruichang counties completed the best, reaching 98 percent of the total public grain to be handed over. It is expected to be completed within three to five days, and other counties are also carrying out the collection of remaining arrears.

    The key to the smooth progress and significant achievements of this autumn grain collection work lies in: First, the counties widely publicized the policy of reasonable burden through the county people's representative meetings and district agricultural representative meetings, promptly dispelling the ideological concerns of the masses and exposing the conspiracy of landlords to sabotage the autumn grain collection. Second, firmly relying on the masses and grasping the materials generally improved the confidence of the cadres in their work. Third, when allocating tasks, the masses were mobilized and combined with the investigation of concealed land and democratic appraisal. Fourth, during the autumn grain collection, the troops actively carried out bandit suppression, creating favorable conditions for completing the autumn grain collection. For example, at the beginning of grain collection in Ruichang, the county's "Sixth and Third" Brigade cooperated with the county and district armed forces to annihilate all five groups of bandits who had infiltrated the county, enabling the grain collection work to proceed smoothly.

　　江西九江专区各县
    运用县区人民代表会议
    领导秋征工作接近完成
    【本报讯】江西九江专区各县秋征工作已接近完成，现正收缴尾欠。该区自去年十二月初开始秋征，广大农民发扬高度的爱国热情，到上月二十四日左右，各县公粮入库数字（连同夏季借粮抵交数）已达全部公粮的百分之八十以上。其中以九江、瑞昌等县完成最好，已达所交公粮总数百分之九十八。预计三、五日内即可完成，其余各县亦正进行收缴尾欠中。
    这次秋征工作进展的如此顺利，并获得显著成绩，主要关键在于：一、各县通过县人民代表会、区农代会，广泛地宣传了合理负担政策，即时解除群众思想顾虑，揭发了地主破坏秋征的阴谋。二、坚决依靠群众，掌握了材料，普遍提高了干部工作信心。三、分配任务时，均能发动群众，与查瞒田、民主评议结合进行。四、在秋征期间，部队积极进行剿匪，给完成秋征，造成了有利条件。如瑞昌在征粮之初，该县“六三”大队即配合县区武装，将流窜入该县之土匪五股悉数歼灭，使征粮工作得以顺利进行。
