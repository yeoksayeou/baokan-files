　　Hail Soviet Cinema!
　　Celebrating the Thirtieth Anniversary of Soviet Cinema
　　Cai Chusheng
　　As a Chinese person, as a cultural worker—especially a filmmaker—in welcoming China's new cultural construction, I see more clearly and painfully how the poison films used by imperialism and reactionary regimes to enslave humanity and compatriots have corroded the souls of the Chinese people. On the other hand, I also see more clearly and genuinely how Soviet films have directly inspired our people to rise up and wage a relentless struggle against the oppressors, and how they have shown our workers the brilliant model of true people's cinema, guiding them to follow that path in tireless struggle.

　　We have painful and shameful memories of the evil influence of those poisonous films in China. Because of the collusion between the Kuomintang reactionary regime and American imperialism, those poison films made by Wall Street financial oligarchs, like a flood, poured into China in greater quantities than before the War of Resistance, along with the guns and cannons used to slaughter the Chinese people and the goods used for economic aggression. The reactionary regime provided every convenience in terms of import, censorship, and screening, allowing them to occupy more than 70 or 80 percent of the Chinese film market, and controlling almost all of the best and largest theaters.

　　Apart from a few progressive works produced by progressives, which were also being persecuted, the content of those films either exaggerated the power of imperialism, or glorified the invaders' bravery in slaughtering weak nations; either whitewashed the increasingly acute class contradictions of the money-worshiping countries, or elevated God to preach the doctrines of the foolish; either peddled the low-level taste of pornography, or depicted people as beasts… It was these things that deeply poisoned the idle classes and petty bourgeoisie in our cities—countless young men and women admired those so-called big stars on the screen, imitating them in every way, from soul to action, clothing, even despising themselves for being suffering Chinese people!

　　This kind of production also led some employed or backward filmmakers to enthusiastically engage in imitation. In the reactionary regime's open anti-Soviet, anti-Communist, anti-people, and anti-progressive actions, they even filmed many vulgar and shameless productions that glorified Kuomintang secret agents and gangsters, as well as terror and pornography.

　　But China's awakened workers, students, and progressive intellectuals have always loved Soviet films and progressive Chinese productions. When excellent productions such as "The Road to Life," "Descendant of Genghis Khan," "Woman's Diversion," "Circus," "Golden Mountain," "We Are from Kronstadt," "Chapayev" (due to lack of materials, I have not been able to list them all)… were screened in China one after another, although they were suppressed by the reactionary authorities, and could only be shown in very remote theaters, many people still eagerly went to watch and study them with a thirst for knowledge. In those films, we saw how brutal the rule of the old Russian Tsars was, and how the masses of people were oppressed. We also saw how the awakened people's heroes, under the leadership of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) and the great revolutionary teachers Lenin and Stalin, were waging heroic struggles against enemies at home and abroad. We saw how the corrupt ruling institutions of old Russia were gradually collapsing and perishing, and we also saw how the newly born Soviet regime was arduously and gloriously carrying out various constructions. We saw how the tens of thousands of working people who were trampled and oppressed in the old era became the masters of the new society, and we also saw how the people who brought many bad habits in the old era were transformed into useful fighters in the new society. We saw the happy and prosperous lives of the Soviet people after the revolution, and we also saw that the oppressed all over the world would rise up and fight with the victory of the Soviet revolution... They educated many workers, students, and intellectuals among our audience, leading them to revolution and to battle. At the same time, they also influenced the outstanding members of our Chinese filmmakers, leading them to be active and progressive, so that under the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, they made many progressive works, regardless of difficulties and dangers, and won the support of the masses.

　　At that time, as leftist films flourished, the reactionary rulers, in addition to using secret agents and gangsters to carry out various intimidations and blows, also used some cultural hooligans to make so-called "soft films" to confront progressive films. The slogan they put forward was that the role of movies for the audience should be "ice cream for the eyes and a sofa chair for the soul." The ultimate purpose of this fallacy is best illustrated by the fact that after the Japanese imperialists occupied Shanghai during the War of Resistance, none of them failed to surrender to the enemy and become traitors who betrayed their motherland and the people!

　　During the eight years of the War of Resistance Against Japan and the three and a half years of the Liberation War, China's progressive filmmakers continued their past struggles, and continuously learned from the increasing amount of Soviet films that were shipped to China. We used this cultural weapon of progressive films to attack the robbers of Japanese imperialism in the past, and we also used this weapon to attack the reactionaries of the Kuomintang.

　　After Changchun, Beijing and other places were liberated one after another, the Chinese people's film industry quickly grew up. The achievements of the Chinese people in the struggle, the heroic typical figures and typical events in the War of Resistance Against Japan and the Liberation War, as well as many moving stories, have all been made into feature films one after another, or are being planned to be made into feature films. At the same time, many historically significant documentary films have also been made.

　　This marks another leap forward to a new starting point, a new stage, in China's film culture movement.

　　We should point out that the influence of Soviet films on Chinese films is enormous, and Chinese films will continue to accept this influence to an even greater extent in the future. At the same time, outstanding Soviet filmmakers are giving us practical help, or will give us help. We believe that the young Chinese people's film industry will grow faster as a result.

　　On the occasion of the brilliant 30th anniversary of Soviet cinema, we extend our warmest congratulations and cheers!

　　向苏联电影欢呼！
    庆祝苏联电影事业三十周年纪念
    蔡楚生
    作为一个中国人，作为一个文化工作者——特别是一个电影工作者，在迎接中国新的文化建设中，会更清楚而痛切地看到帝国主义和反动政权用以奴化人类奴化同胞的毒素电影，曾是如何地腐蚀过中国人的灵魂；另一方面也更清楚而真切地看到了苏联的电影是如何直接地在鼓舞着我们人民起来对压迫者作无情的斗争，和使我们的工作者看到了真正的人民电影的光辉典范，而遵循着那样的道路作不息的奋斗。
    对于那些饱含毒素的电影在中国所起的恶影响，我们是有着痛苦而耻辱的记忆的。由于国民党反动政权之勾结美帝，投靠美帝，于是随着用以屠杀中国人民的枪炮，随着用以作经济侵略的货品，那些华尔街金融寡头们所制造的毒素电影，就像洪水般比抗战以前还要多量地涌到中国来了。反动政权在进口，检查，演映上，都给予以一切的便利，而使它在中国的电影市场上占有了百分之七八十以上的数量，使最好最大的以及所有的影院几乎都控制在他们的掌握之中。
    除了少数进步人士所制作的，也正在受迫害的作品之外，那些电影的内容，不是在夸张帝国主义的威力如何强大，就是在宣扬侵略者对弱小民族的杀戳如何勇敢；不是把阶级矛盾日益深刻化的金元国家粉饰得天花乱坠，就是把上帝抬出来作愚民的说教；不是在卖弄色情的低级趣味，就是把人写成野兽，……就是这些，使我们都市中的有闲阶级和小市民层受到了深刻的毒害——无数少爷小姐们在爱慕着银幕上的那些所谓大明星，从灵魂到行动，衣饰，都模仿得一模一样，甚至会慊恶自己是一个苦难的中国人！
    这种制作，也使一些御用的或落后的电影工作者热狂地从事模仿，在反动政权公开作反苏、反共、反人民、反进步的行动中，他们就摄制过许多歌颂国特流氓，以及恐怖色情等下流无耻的制作。
    但中国觉醒了的工人学生和进步的知识分子，却是始终在热爱着苏联片和中国进步的制作的。当《生路》、《成吉思汗的子孙》、《女性的消遣》、《马戏团》、《金山》、《我们来自克隆斯达》、《夏伯阳》（因手边无材料，未能尽录）……等这些优秀的制作先后在中国放映时，虽受反动当局的压迫，以至仅能在很冷僻的戏院中上映，但许多人仍是抱着求知的心热烈地去作观摩，学习。在那些片子里，我们看到了旧俄沙皇的统治是如何的残暴，和人民大众之如何地受着压迫，也看到了觉醒了的人民英雄们在联共（布）党和伟大的革命导师列宁和斯大林领导之下，对内外的敌人在作着如何英勇的斗争；我们看到了旧俄腐败的统治机构如何一步步地在走向崩溃灭亡，也看到了新生的苏维埃政权如何艰辛和伟大的在进行着各种建设；我们看到了在旧的世代里被践踏压迫的成千成万的劳动人民成为新社会的主人，也看到了在旧的世代里带来了许多恶习的人们，在新的社会里都被改造成为有用的斗士；我们看到了苏联革命后人民大众愉快幸福的生活，也看到了全世界的被压迫者都将随着苏联革命的胜利而起来斗争，……它们教育着我们观众中的许多工人、学生、知识分子，走向革命，走向战斗，同时它们也影响着我们中国电影工作者中的优秀分子们，走向积极，走向进步，从而在国民党的反动统治下，不顾艰危地摄制了许多有进步意义的作品，获得了广大群众的拥护。
    在当时，左翼的电影既蓬勃地发展起来，反动的统治者除了利用特务流氓进行种种恐吓和打击外，还利用一些文化界的流氓，在摄制一些所谓“软性电影”来和进步的电影对抗。他们所提出的口号，是电影对观众的作用应是“眼睛吃的冰琪琳，心灵坐的沙发椅”。这种谬论的最终目的，最好的说明就是他们在抗战中日本帝国主义者侵占了上海之后，他们竟没有一个例外地都投敌附逆做了背叛祖国、背叛人民的汉奸！
    在八年的抗日战争，和三年半的解放战争中，中国进步的电影工作者都继续着过去那样的奋斗，和不断向络续运到中国来的更多量的苏联电影学习，我们用进步电影的这一文化武器打击过去日本帝国主义的强盗们，也用这一武器打击过国民党的反动派。
    在长春、北京等地先后获得解放之后，中国人民的电影事业便很快地在成长起来了。中国人民在斗争中的业绩，抗日和解放战争中英勇的典型人物和典型事件，以及许多可歌可泣的故事，有些都已先后被摄成故事片，或在计划着要把它摄成故事片，同时，也摄制了许多有历史意义的纪录的电影。
    这在中国的电影文化运动上又跃进到一个新的起点，新的阶段。
    我们应该指出，苏联电影给予中国电影的影响是巨大的，而且，今后的中国电影还要继续和扩大地去接受这种影响。同时，苏联优秀的电影工作者也正在给予我们以实际的帮助，或将给予我们以帮助，我们相信，年青的中国人民电影事业会因此而加速地成长起来的。
    欣逢光辉的苏联电影三十周年纪念，谨致我们最热烈的庆贺和欢呼！
