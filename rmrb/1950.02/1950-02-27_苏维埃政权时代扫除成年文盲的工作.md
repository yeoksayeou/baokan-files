　　The Work of Eliminating Adult Illiteracy in the Soviet Regime Era
　　Jiang Hongju
    After the victory of the Great October Socialist Revolution in the Soviet Union, an instruction on eliminating adult illiteracy was issued because, before the revolution—during the Tsarist era—illiteracy accounted for 80 percent of the national population. Lenin once said: "It is impossible to build a communist society in an illiterate country."
    However, the work of eliminating illiteracy is an arduous task and requires a long time. The Soviet Union has gone through a long journey of thirty-two years in this work. The government and the party regarded the elimination of illiteracy as a major revolutionary task and made long-term and continuous efforts. In 1940, the Soviet government announced that it had eradicated illiteracy for 50 million people. Now the Soviet Union is a country where everyone is literate.
    In the era of the Soviet regime, the process of eliminating illiteracy can be divided into three stages:
    (1) The First Ten Years of Eliminating Illiteracy
    In the early days of the revolution, the work of eliminating illiteracy encountered many difficulties. Some intellectuals did not quite understand the new socialist regime, and the general public did not fully trust the work of eliminating illiteracy. At the same time, the Soviet regime had just been established, and on the other hand, it had to wage arduous struggles with enemies at home and abroad. At that time, it was right after the First World War, and the economy of the backward Tsarist Russia was on the verge of collapse. The domestic material conditions were extremely poor, and all teaching equipment, textbooks, paper, and stationery were very scarce. But the Soviet government and the Communist Party did not stop the work of eliminating illiteracy because of the many difficulties encountered.
    On December 26, 1919, the Soviet government, based on Lenin's proposal, issued an instruction on eliminating illiteracy, stipulating that people aged eight to fifty must be literate and read books. After this instruction was announced, a literacy campaign was immediately launched across the country, and a network of literacy schools was established. At the same time, in order to need a large number of new talents to participate in construction work in the early days of the revolution, a large number of training courses were opened, and factories, institutions, and schools were used as training institutions. The training period varied in length depending on the nature of the work.
    The school network established for eliminating illiteracy is divided into two parts. One is the illiteracy school network, which trains adults and young people over the age of fifteen to have writing and calculation skills. This school is attached to existing cultural institutions; where there are no cultural institutions, it is established separately. In sparsely populated areas, mobile schools are organized. The other is the primary school network, targeting adults and young people over the age of fifteen who are completely illiterate and have poor writing and reading skills.
    In order to cultivate truly people's intellectuals among workers and peasants, select outstanding elements, and further improve their cultural level, workers' universities were established. Their main task was to absorb all workers or peasants to study. They had very few people who had received education in the Tsarist era, so at this time, the Soviet government and the Party enabled them to receive education, so that they could become new Soviet intellectuals and have the ability to manage state administrative affairs. This kind of workers' university is sometimes attached to a university, and university professors and experts are responsible for lecturing. After graduation, they can go to specialized schools or universities for further study.
    In order to strengthen the work of eliminating illiteracy, the People's Commissariat for Education also organized an "All-Russian Extraordinary Committee for Eliminating Illiteracy," which was specifically responsible for the work of eliminating illiteracy and was responsible for organization and specific implementation. The association organized all the staff of various agencies to participate in the work of eliminating illiteracy, and promoted the literacy movement into a mass movement. Many engineers, teachers, young students, literate male and female workers, Communist Party members, and Communist Youth League members were involved in this great movement. All literate staff members in factories, schools, and institutions participated in this work. "Everyone who is literate must teach an illiterate person" was an important slogan at that time.
    In 1923, the "Society for the Elimination of Illiteracy" was organized, and the work of eliminating illiteracy was expanded to various counties, towns, factories, and villages. At that time, the leader of this work was Kalinin. Kalinin used all his wisdom and unyielding perseverance to implement the Party's instructions and Lenin's and Stalin's instructions on eliminating illiteracy. And organized hundreds of thousands of cultural troops as the basic cadres for the work of eliminating illiteracy, they served the people without taking any remuneration. The "Society for the Elimination of Illiteracy" focused on strengthening the work of rural education, and absorbed people who had graduated from illiteracy stations to participate in handling wall newspapers to prevent the re-commission of illiteracy. In 1925, the "Society for the Elimination of Illiteracy" already had 1.6 million members, 28,000 grass-roots organizations, and distributed 5 million literacy primers.
    During this period, the quality of the work of eliminating illiteracy was continuously improved, the teaching methods were studied and improved, and the content of textbooks was planned and compiled. It was very difficult at the beginning of the work, because the working class and the peasants had never received education in the past and had been working hard, so they felt very difficult when they first started learning, but their enthusiasm and will to learn were very strong. After a difficult period, it became easier, and they gradually acquired rich knowledge. In the initial period, there was a lack of teaching materials suitable for adult learning. Generally, the methods of educating children were still used, and children's stories, fairy tales, dictation, and grammar were used to educate those adults, which made them feel bored and gradually lost their confidence in seeking knowledge, and some people dropped out of school as a result. Therefore, the Teaching Method Bureau was organized at that time to specifically study how to adopt teaching methods suitable for adult psychology. The Third All-Soviet Teaching Method Conference in May 1925 specifically raised these issues for discussion. Adult education should pay attention to their interests. The most important thing is that the teaching materials should be linked to real life, so that adults can acquire truly useful knowledge and be able to apply it to real life. Therefore, the earliest adult literacy primers in the Soviet Union were compiled with simple slogans. These slogans originated from real life and were close to the workers who fought for freedom. For example, "The worker-peasant alliance is invincible." Such a slogan is not only easy for adults to understand and remember, but also has a real educational effect on them, indicating the road to victory and communism. In addition, teaching methods such as reading newspapers, reading propaganda pamphlets with relatively simple text, copying articles they like, practicing describing their own thoughts, writing short essays, and application texts were adopted. When editing literacy primers, the living conditions of the workers should be taken into account, and appropriate answers should be given to all the workers' questions.
    During this period, the staff participating in the work of eliminating illiteracy had gained many valuable experiences in teaching: In order to make this work better, they should first master the correct attitude towards illiteracy themselves. Adults learn to read and write relatively slowly when they start, and they should be patiently explained to them, expand their vocabulary and concept accumulation in the popular language they are accustomed to, and they should often retell what they have learned. To cultivate their ability to use various tools books, such as dictionaries and various manuals. It is necessary to carefully listen to the students' requirements and take care of their interests and wishes.
    In 1920, a magazine called "Eliminating Illiteracy" was published in various national languages. This magazine played a great educational role for adults at that time. The content was to provide many materials for illiterate people to learn, answers to agricultural problems, questions about self-study, and exchange of experiences in the work of eliminating illiteracy.
    From the early days of the revolution to 1925, the work of eliminating illiteracy achieved significant achievements. In 1922, only 463,300 illiterate people participated in learning, and in 1925, it increased to 1,383,300. Obviously, the progress of the work was relatively slow in the first one or two years, and the speed of development accelerated in the following years, proving that this work is always difficult at the beginning.
    (2) The Second Ten Years of Eliminating Illiteracy and Semi-literacy
    At the end of 1927, the first stage of the work of eliminating illiteracy passed. At this time, the Soviet national economy had achieved decisive success.
    Due to the economic boom, the living conditions and cultural level of the working class and peasants have been generally improved and raised. Therefore, at the beginning of this new stage, the focus was placed on the education of semi-literate people and the elimination of illiteracy in rural areas. At this time, it was not only necessary to make the working class and peasants merely literate, but also to make them proficient and good at managing state affairs. At that time, the Soviet government and the Party put forward such a task: to strive for the working masses in the working class and peasants and strengthen the cultural upsurge. Molotov said in his report "On Rural Work": "Without truly raising culture, it is impossible for us to develop rapidly."
    At the beginning of this decade, a unified and complete plan for eliminating illiteracy was formulated, and various groups engaged in this work were organized to cooperate with each other and spread from cities to rural areas. The Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) used Party organizations, Soviets, trade unions, and the Association for the Elimination of Illiteracy to resolutely accelerate the work of eliminating illiteracy; first, to educate industrial workers and the new class of the proletariat in cities, and to educate hired peasants, workers of state-owned farms, short-term workers, the poor, and workers of collective farms in rural areas. At the same time as educating illiterate people, the network of semi-literate schools was widely launched.
    On May 17, 1929, the "Instruction on the Work of Eliminating Illiteracy" of the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) specifically proposed the establishment of tutoring groups for eliminating illiteracy in various urban and rural Soviets, the holding of conferences for eliminating illiteracy and semi-literacy, the organization of guidance centers for urban and rural illiteracy, and the use of eliminating illiteracy as a kind of political education work. Trade unions and cooperative organizations also systematically participated in the work of eliminating illiteracy and carried out education based on the specific conditions of the workers.
    In 1930, all groups participating in the work of eliminating illiteracy (including national education organs, the Communist Youth League, trade unions, university student groups, collective farm organizations, scientific workers associations, the State Publishing Bureau or the Central Publishing Bureau, the Central Radio Station, and the Correspondence Education Bureau) held a meeting and resolved:
    (1) To organize a socialist competition to eliminate illiteracy within a limited time, and launch a shock movement in various cities, enterprise departments, and agencies.
    (2) To systematically check the work of lower-level organizations for eliminating illiteracy (such as factory committees, lower-level cooperative organizations, economic institutions, etc.).
    (3) To implement social and political education on the basis of a unified plan.
    (4) To mobilize various groups to organize 2 million cultural troops. Actually participate in the work of eliminating illiteracy.
    On the basis of a unified plan, schools for the illiterate and semi-literate were universally established. These schools study for 330 hours per school year. Schools in cities have ten months of study per year, eleven days of classes per month, and three hours per day. In rural areas, there are seven months of study per school year and twelve days of classes per month. Four hours a day, the rest of the time can not be used for classes during the busy farming season. In illiteracy schools, two courses are conducted: Russian and arithmetic. Semi-literate schools have three courses: Russian, arithmetic, and geography. Russian focuses on letters, pronunciation, and grammar. Arithmetic focuses on practical application methods. The geographical aspect is general knowledge of domestic and world geography and political geography, etc.
    In 1929, 2,055,800 illiterate and semi-literate people were educated, which doubled in 1930 and increased sixfold in 1932.
    During this period, the most noteworthy phenomenon was that the number of illiterate people gradually decreased, and the number of semi-literate people increased day by day. This proves that the cultural level of the working class and peasants has been generally improved.
    In 1930, the Soviet government decided to implement universal compulsory education and established tens of thousands of adult schools throughout the country.
    Soviet adult schools are divided into incomplete middle schools and adult middle schools. The former is equivalent to a seven-year school, and the latter is equivalent to an ordinary middle school. These schools are required to recruit adults with primary school education, and all expenses are provided by the state, and some places are provided by trade unions and social groups. Classes are held two to three times a week, mostly at night. After graduating from an incomplete middle school, after passing the exam, they can be promoted to secondary vocational schools; after graduating from an adult middle school, they can be promoted to universities for further study. Although it is an amateur nature, the education received and the rights enjoyed in the education system are the same as those of ordinary schools. Thousands of Soviet engineers, technicians, agronomists, doctors, and teachers have completed secondary education in adult middle schools and then entered universities for further study.
    Adult education during this period was different from the workers' universities in the first stage of the work of eliminating illiteracy. At that time, the workers' universities were separated from production, but during this period, workers and peasants received complete education without being separated from production.
    In addition, adult correspondence middle schools were established. Those who complete correspondence middle school and pass the graduation exam can be promoted to universities, and their qualifications are equal to those of ordinary middle school graduates.
    During this period, the education system has been regularized, everyone has the opportunity to receive education, and the work of eliminating illiteracy has achieved brilliant achievements.
    (3) The Third Ten Years of Eliminating Illiteracy and Semi-literacy
    From 1938 to 1940, the Soviet national economy had reached the highest stage of development, and the material life and cultural level of the workers had been greatly improved. The beginning of this period was the eve of the victorious completion of the work of eliminating illiteracy. Illiteracy has been completely eliminated in factories, enterprises, institutions, collective farms, and state-owned farms throughout the Soviet Union. Many enterprise organizations and trade union organizations launched socialist competitions to complete the work of eliminating illiteracy within a limited time.
    The main task of this period was to further improve the cultural level of workers and peasants, and to raise the cultural and scientific level of workers and peasants to the level of scientific and technical experts. Industrial colleges were established, specializing in recruiting workers and peasants who had graduated from workers' universities and various supplementary schools. After graduation, they could work as technical experts and leading cadres in various enterprise departments. In addition, in terms of teaching, workers and peasants should have a certain level of scientific training, so that they can establish practical contact with scientific workers and exchange opinions with scientific workers using their production knowledge in industry and agriculture. Soviet scientists have always been closely linked with knowledgeable masses.
    In terms of social education, cultural institutions were universally established. During this period, 70,000 large-scale libraries were established in China, with 126 million books, 97,000 clubs, 790 theaters, and 30,461 cinemas. Various concrete methods were used to improve the level of workers and peasants in politics, production, and literature and art. At the same time, the "Association for the Promotion of Political and Scientific Knowledge" was established, and many famous scientists and scholars were invited to make special reports and speeches. Political and scientific knowledge was widely popularized. Not only in big cities, but also in various villages and collective farms, general lectures were held.
    In 1939, 89.1% of the Soviet population aged nine to forty-nine were literate. The number of literate men accounted for 95.1%. The number of literate women was only 12.4% in 1897, which increased to 72.6% in 1939, almost a sixfold increase.
    Under the leadership of the Party and the government, the Soviet people have improved their cultural level, eliminated their backwardness in politics and culture, and become active fighters in communist construction.
    The achievement of the Soviet Union in eliminating illiteracy and semi-literacy in the last ten years lies in the fact that many students who graduated from illiteracy and semi-literacy schools have a high degree of political awareness and rich scientific knowledge. Many of them play an active role in factories, manufacturing plants, mines, and collective farms, linking the knowledge they have acquired with practical production experience. Many of them have become outstanding Stakhanov movement workers, playing an exemplary role in various socialist construction tasks.
    Throughout the entire process of eliminating illiteracy, the institutions responsible for education, the Soviet teachers, intellectuals, advanced workers, and collective farm workers, Communist Party members, Communist Youth League members, and trade unions have made their best efforts and achieved significant results. Especially the powerful cultural troops and Soviet teachers organized at that time. The cultural troops were unpaid, going deep into factories, rural areas, and various departments to educate illiterate people, help them learn, and answer many relevant questions. In 1940, there were 300,000 cultural troops participating in work in the Russian Socialist Federation Republic. From 1940 to 1941, there were 12,560 people in the Tatar Socialist Autonomous Republic. As many as 7,000 middle school teachers participated in the work. These teachers are the best and most suitable workers in the work of eliminating illiteracy, because they themselves have rich teaching experience, understand teaching methods, and can also help other cultural troops. They understand their own school students very well, and give appropriate enlightenment and guidance according to the specific circumstances of each student.
    During this period, Soviet industry and agriculture have reached a high level of development, and the people's living standards and cultural level have generally improved. Every young person, especially the children of workers and peasants, has the opportunity to receive regular education. Therefore, workers' universities and adult schools have gradually decreased.
    During the Great Patriotic War, many young men and women in the Soviet Union, motivated by patriotic enthusiasm, left their schools and went to various factories and institutions to participate in work. After the war, in order for these young people to receive complete education, the Soviet government established worker-youth schools and rural youth schools in 1943. The former was established for workers, and the latter was for peasants. Both types of schools are regular schools, and the courses are the same as those in ordinary middle schools.
    Worker-youth schools are seven-year schools composed of the fifth, sixth, and seventh grades (except for the first four grades), and middle schools composed of the fifth grade to the tenth grade. These schools specialize in recruiting young men and women aged fifteen to twenty-five who work in factories, workshops, mines, and enterprises.
    The courses are taught according to the outline of Soviet seven-year schools and ordinary middle schools. Boys and girls are in the same school. In order to take care of the study time of young people working in factories, classes are held in the morning, afternoon, and evening, with a limit of 20 people per class. The teaching organization and methods are different from ordinary middle schools. According to the new teaching plan promulgated in 1946, classes are taught for 16 hours per week, and discussions and research are conducted for 4 hours, totaling 20 hours (the teaching time for seven-year schools and middle schools in the fifth grade to the tenth grade is 32 hours). There are also two months of vacation in the summer every year, the same as ordinary schools. The courses include: Russian (literature reading and literature), arithmetic, algebra, geometry, trigonometry, nature, history, Soviet constitution, geography, physics, astronomy, chemistry, foreign languages, drafting, etc. Although the teaching hours are less than those of ordinary schools, this does not prevent young workers from fully absorbing the teaching materials of seven-year schools and secondary schools. The main reasons are: (1) The young people who study in worker-youth schools themselves have more or less experience in life, have a great thirst for knowledge, and are determined and persevering to overcome any difficulties. Many of them are outstanding young Stakhanov movement workers in factories, mines, and mining areas. They have recognized the importance of work and study and how to complete their major tasks. (2) They are good at finding time to study in busy work, using every minute to study school courses, diligently self-studying, developing self-criticism among comrades, helping each other, and often conducting discussions. They know how to link knowledge with real life. Also, because each class is limited to 20 people, teachers can take care of everyone when teaching. Therefore, the achievements of graduates of Soviet worker-youth schools are very excellent.
    From 1943 to 1944, there were 1,088 worker-youth schools in the Russian Republic alone, with 100,000 students, and in 1946 the number of schools increased to 2,001, with 324,770 students.
    In 1946, 10,018 people completed worker-youth schools in the Russian Republic alone, and 31,016 people completed the seventh grade of worker-youth schools.
    On July 6, 1944, the Soviet government decided to establish rural youth schools in major villages and collective farms to enable rural youth to receive regular education.
    Rural youth schools have two forms: one is a primary school with grades one to four; the other is a seven-year school with grades one to seven. If there are not enough students in a certain area to open a rural youth school, then individual night classes will be formed. Rural youth schools are under the jurisdiction of the education departments of each union republic and are led by local national education organs. These schools use the national language for teaching. The education department and local national education organs help schools select teachers, supply textbooks, books, instruments, and school supplies.
    Rural youth schools recruit young men and women and teenagers aged fourteen to twenty-five and enable them to receive complete education without being separated from agricultural production. Classes are held after work is completed. The school year starts from November 1 to May of the following year, because May 1 to the end of October is the busy farming season, and rural youth do not have time to attend classes. Students graduating from rural schools must pass an exam, and those who pass the exam should be given a graduation certificate and can continue their studies.
    In 1947, more than 200,000 people studied in rural youth schools in the Russian Republic.
    Worker-youth schools and rural youth schools are another form of Soviet adult education. After graduating from these schools, they can be promoted to the eighth grade of complete middle schools or secondary vocational schools, teachers colleges, or medical schools. After several stages, they can be promoted to universities and specialized schools.
    The Soviet Union's work of eliminating illiteracy has gone through a long journey of 30 years. The Soviet government and the Party have always followed the instructions of the great Lenin and Stalin on the work of eliminating illiteracy, and have continuously improved teaching methods and improved the quality of work in the long-term work process, so as to successfully complete this major task.
    The Soviet Union's work of eliminating illiteracy in the first stage was to call on all illiterate people to learn literacy and develop writing skills. The second stage was to improve the cultural level of workers and peasants. The third stage was to improve the cultural and scientific level of workers and peasants to the same level as technical experts.
    The biggest feature of the teaching system is to receive regular education in spare time. Students who graduate from spare-time schools enjoy the same rights as graduates of ordinary schools in the national education system and can be promoted to universities or specialized schools. The attitude of teachers lecturing and students learning is very serious and earnest. Ideological and political education is also paid attention to in the work of educating illiterate people, because the work of eliminating illiteracy is a kind of political education. In any course, scientific materialism and people's patriotism are used to educate illiterate people, so that they can become truly new Soviet intellectuals who serve the people.
    The experience of the Soviet Union in eliminating illiteracy has proved that this is a work that requires a considerable amount of time and patience.
    Now, the number of literate people in the Soviet Union accounts for more than 90% of the total population. Adult illiteracy has disappeared, and only a few elderly people are illiterate. In 1949, the Soviet government stipulated that everyone not only has the right to receive education, but also must be forced to receive seven years of education. Whether in cities or rural areas, seven years of compulsory education is universally implemented. In addition, in the next few years, such a task must be completed, that is, in addition to seven-year schools, ten-year schools must also become compulsory education, and ten years of compulsory education must be implemented throughout the country. Everyone must receive ten years of education.
    In 1950, the Soviet government's national expenditure on the development of cultural undertakings and the health care of workers in urban and rural areas is estimated at 106 billion rubles, which is 2.6 times higher than in 1940.

　　苏维埃政权时代扫除成年文盲的工作
　　蒋洪举
    苏联在伟大的十月社会主义革命胜利以后，就颁布过一个扫除成年文盲的指示，因为在革命前——帝俄时代，文盲占全国人口百分之八十。列宁曾经说：“在一个文盲的国家里是不可能建设共产主义社会的。”
    然而，扫除文盲的工作是一个繁重而且需要长久时间的工作。苏联在这一工作上，曾经走过三十二年悠长的路程，政府和党把扫除文盲的工作，作为一种重大的革命任务，经过长期的不断的努力。一九四○年，苏联政府宣布曾经肃清了文盲五千万人。现在苏联已经是一个人人识字的国家了。
    在苏维埃政权时代，扫除文盲工作的经过，可分为三个阶段：
    （一）最初十年的扫除文盲工作
    在革命成功的初期，扫除文盲的工作曾经遭遇到很多的困难，一部分知识分子对于新的社会主义政权不大了解，一般群众对于扫除文盲的工作并不十分信任，而同时苏维埃政权刚刚建立起来，另一方面还要与国内国外的敌人作艰苦的斗争。其时正当第一次世界大战以后，落后的帝俄的经济几颠于崩溃，国内物质条件极为贫困，一切教学用的设备、教科书、纸张、文具，都非常缺乏。但苏联政府和共产党并没有因为遭遇到许多困难而中止扫除文盲的工作。
    一九一九年十二月二十六日，苏联政府根据列宁的提议，颁布了扫除文盲的指示。规定凡八岁到五十岁的人一定要认识字，要读书。这个指示公布后，全国立即广泛地展开了识字运动，建立识字学校网。同时为了在革命初期，需要大批的新的人材，参加建设工作，因此大量地开设各种训练班，利用工厂、机关及学校作为训练机构，训练时期长短不同，视作业的性质而定。
    为从事扫除文盲而建立的学校网，分为两个部分，一种是文盲学校网，培养十五岁以上的成年人和青年人，使其有写作及计算的能力。这种学校附设在现有的文化机关内；没有文化机关的地方，就单独成立。在人口稀少的地方，则组织流动性质的学校。另外一种是初级学校网，对象是根本不识字和写读能力很差的十五岁以上的成人和青年。
    为了要在工人和农民中，培养真正人民的知识分子，选拔优秀分子，进一步提高他们的文化水平，因此又设立了工人大学，其主要的任务，是吸收一切工人或农民学习，他们在帝俄时代很少有人受过教育，所以这时苏联政府和党就使他们受教育，使他们成为新的苏维埃知识分子，能够具有管理国家行政事务的能力。这种工人大学有时是附设在大学里，由大学教授和专家担任讲授，毕业后可以升入专门学校或大学里去深造。
    为了加强扫除文盲工作，教育人民委员部又组织了一个“全俄扫除文盲非常委员会”，专门负责扫除文盲工作，并担负组织与具体实施的责任。该会把所有各机关的工作人员都组织起来，参加扫除文盲的工作。并且把识字运动，推广成为一个群众性的运动，许多工程师，教师，青年学生，能够读写的男女工人，共产党员，青年团员，都卷入这一大运动中。无论工厂、学校、机关里的，凡是认识字的工作人员，都参加了这个工作。“每一个识字的人，一定要教会一个不识字的人”，这是当时的一个重要的口号。
    一九二三年又组织了“消灭文盲”协会。把消灭文盲的工作展开到各县、各镇、各工厂及乡村中去。当时领导这一工作的是加里宁。加里宁以其全部英明才智和坚韧不摧的毅力，来实现党的指令以及列宁和斯大林关于扫除文盲的指示。并组织了数十万文化军，作为扫除文盲工作的基本干部，他们为人民服务，而不取任何报酬。“消灭文盲”协会，把重点放在加强乡村教育的工作上，并吸收从文盲站已经毕业的人，参加办理墙报，来防止文盲的再犯。一九二五年“消灭文盲”协会已经有一百六十万会员，二万八千个底层组织，发行了五百万的识字读本。
    在这个时期内，曾不断地提高扫除文盲工作的质量，研究改进教学的方法，和计划编纂教科书的内容。在开始工作的时候，是十分困难的，因为工人阶级和农民，过去根本没有受过教育，一直是辛苦地劳动着，所以在他们初学的时候，感觉非常困难，但是学习的热情和意志是很坚强的。经过一个困难的时期，以后便觉得容易，渐渐地获得了丰富的知识。最初的时期，缺乏适于成人学习的教本，一般还是采用教育儿童的方法，用儿童故事、童话、默写和文法等等课程来教育那些成年人，使他们兴味索然，渐渐失去求学的信心，一部分人因而退学了。因此，当时又组织了教学方法局，专门研究采取怎样适合于成年人心理的教学方法。一九二五年五月第三次全苏教学方法会议，特别把这些问题提出来讨论。成年人的教育，应当注意他们的兴趣，最主要的是教学的材料要与实际的生活联系起来，使成年人能够获得真正有用的知识，能够在实际的生活上去应用。因此，苏联最早的成年人认字读本是用简单的口号编成的。这些口号产生于实际的生活，是与争取自由的劳动者相接近的。例如“工农联盟，不可战胜”，这样的口号，不但使成年人宜于了解和记忆，而且对于他们有真正教育的作用，指示出走向胜利，走向共产主义的道路。此外，并采用读报纸，读文字比较浅显的宣传小册子，抄写他们喜爱的文章，练习记述自己的思想，写短小的作文以及应用文等教学办法。在编辑识字读本时，要照顾到劳动者的生活情况，要对劳动者所有的问题，予以适当的解答。
    这个时期内，参加扫除文盲工作的工作人员，在教学方面，已经获得许多珍贵的经验：为了要使这一工作做得更好，应该首先自己掌握正确地对待文盲的态度。成年人开始学习识字和写作时，比较缓慢，应当耐心地为他们讲解，用他们所习惯的通俗的语言，扩充他们语汇和概念的贮积，并要时常使他们重述自己已经学过的东西。要培养他们学会利用各种工具书籍，如字典及各种手册等的能力。须要细心地倾听学生们的要求，照顾到他们的兴趣和愿望。
    一九二○年曾出版一种杂志，叫做“消灭文盲”，是用各民族的语言出版的，这杂志对于当时的成年人起了很大的教育作用，内容是提供许多对于文盲学习的材料，有关农业问题的解答，关于自学问题及交换扫除文盲的工作经验等等。
    从革命初期到一九二五年，扫除文盲的工作，获得了重大的成就。一九二二年文盲参加学习的仅四十六万三千三百人，一九二五年增加到一百三十八万三千三百人。很显明的，在最初一二年内工作的推进是比较缓慢的，以后几年发展的速度日益加速，证明这一工作，在开始时总是困难的。
    （二）第二个十年的扫除文盲及半文盲的工作
    一九二七年年底扫除文盲工作的第一个阶段过去了，这时，苏联国民经济已经达到了决定性的成功。
    由于经济的高涨，工人阶级和农民的生活情况，文化水平普遍地改善和提高了。因此，在这一新的阶段开始时，重点是放在半文盲的教育和扫除乡村文盲的工作上。这时不仅要使工人阶级和农民仅仅认识字而已，而且要使他们熟练及善于管理国家的事务。当时苏联政府和党提出了这样的任务：为争取工人阶级及农民中的劳动群众，加强文化的高涨而斗争。莫洛托夫在他的“论乡村工作”的报告中说：“没有真正地提高文化，我们很快地向前发展是不可能的”。
    在这个十年之初，曾制定了一个统一的完整的扫除文盲工作的计划，把从事这个工作的各个团体组织起来，互相配合，从城市推广到农村中去。联共（布）中央委员会利用党的组织、苏维埃、职工会和消灭文盲协会等，坚决地加速扫除文盲的工作；首先是在城市里教育产业工人和无产阶级的新阶层，在乡村里，教育雇农、国营农场的工人、短工、贫民和集体农场的工作人员。与教育文盲工作同时并进的，就是广泛地展开半文盲学校网。
    一九二九年五月十七日联共（布）中央委员会“关于扫除文盲工作”的指示，特别提出在各城市及乡村苏维埃中成立扫除文盲辅导小组，举行消灭文盲及半文盲大会，组织城市及乡村文盲指导所，把消除文盲工作，作为一种政治教育工作。职工会和合作机构也有系统地参加扫除文盲的工作，并根据劳动者的具体条件而进行教育。
    一九三○年所有参加扫除文盲工作的各团体（包括国民教育机关，共产主义青年团，职工会，大学生团体，集体农场组织，科学工作者协会，国家出版局或中央出版局，中央电台，函授教育局），曾经举行了一次会议，议决：
    （一）组织限期扫除文盲的社会主义竞赛，在各个城市，各企业部门及各机关中发动突击运动。
    （二）有系统地检查扫除文工作的下级组织的工作情形（如工厂委员会，下级合作机关，经济机构等）。
    （三）在统一的计划的基础上，实施社会政治教育。
    （四）动员各团体单位，组织二百万文化军。实际参加扫除文盲的工作。
    在统一的计划的基础上，文盲及半文盲学校普遍地设立起来，这些学校每学年学习时间为三百三十小时。在城市中的学校，全年有十个月学习，每月有十一天上课，每天三小时。在农村中每学年学习七个月，每月十二天上课。每天四小时，其余如农忙时间不能上课。在文盲学校中进行两门课程：俄语和算术。半文盲学校有三门课程：俄语、算术、地理。俄语注意在尺牍、正音和文法。算术注意实际的应用方法。地理方面是国内及世界地理常识和政治地理等。
    一九二九年教育了文盲与半文盲二百零五万五千八百人，一九三零年增加了两倍，一九三二年增加了六倍之多。
    在这个时期内，最值得注意的现象，就是文盲的人数日渐减少，半文盲的人数日益增加。这证明工人阶级和农民的文化水平已普遍地提高了。
    一九三○年苏联政府决议实施普及义务教育，在全国各地设立了数万所成年学校。
    苏联的成人学校分为不完全中学与成人中学两种，前者是相当于七年制学校，后者与普通中学的程度相等。这些学校所招收的成年人，必需具有小学教育的程度，一切费用由国家供给，有些地方是由职工会和社会团体供给的。每周上课两次至三次，多半是在夜间。不完全中学毕业以后，经过考试，得升入中等职业学校；成人中学毕业后，得升入高等学校，继续深造。虽然是业余性质，但是所受的教育和在教育制度上所享有的权利是与普通学校一样的。苏联有成千成万的工程师、技师、农学家、医生、教师都是在成人中学受完中等教育，而后进入大学深造的。
    这个时期的成人教育，是与扫除文盲工作第一个阶段的工人大学有所不同的，那时的工人大学是脱离生产的，然而在这个时期内，工人和农民是不脱离生产而接受完整的教育。
    此外，并成立成人函授中学，读完函授中学而毕业考试及格者，可以升入高等学校，与普通中学毕业生资格相等。
    在这个时期内，教育制度已经正规化，人人已有受教育的机会，扫除文盲的工作已获得辉煌的成就了。
    （三）第三个十年的扫除文盲及半文盲的工作
    一九三八年至一九四○年，苏联国民经济已经达到最大的高涨时期，劳动者物质生活和文化水平大大地提高了。这个时期的开始，就是扫除文盲工作将要胜利完成的前夕。苏联全国各地，工厂、企业、机关、集体农场、国营农场中已经全部肃清了文盲。很多企业机构和职工会的组织，展开了社会主义竞赛，限期完成肃清文盲的工作。
    这个时期主要的任务，就是进一步提高工人和农民的文化水平，把工人，农民的文化科学水平提到科学技术专家那样的水平。设立工业学院，专收原在工人大学毕业和各种补习学校毕业的工人和农民，毕业后可以作技术专家和各企业部门的领导干部。另外在教学方面，使工人和农民在科学上有一定的修养，使他们能够与科学工作者取得实际的联系，利用自己在工业和农业方面的生产知识与科学工作者交换意见。苏联的科学家一直是与有知识的群众紧密地联系在一起的。
    在社会教育方面，普遍地成立了文化机构。在这个时期内，国内成立了七万所规模宏大的图书馆，拥有一亿二千六百万册图书，开办了九万七千个俱乐部，七百九十座剧院，三万零四百六十一座电影院。利用各种具体的办法，使工农在政治；生产；文艺各方面提高他们的水平。同时成立了“政治和科学知识推广协会”，请很多有名的科学家、学者作专题的报告演讲。广泛地普及政治与科学的知识。不仅大城市，而且各村镇，集体农场中都举行普遍的讲演会。
    一九三九年，苏联人口中九岁至四十九岁认识字的人，占百分之八十九点一，识字男子的人数占百分之九十五点一，妇女的识字人数，一八九七年仅占百分之十二点四，一九三九年增加到百分之七十二点六，几乎是增加六倍。
    苏联人民在党和政府的领导下，提高了文化的水平，消灭了自己在政治、文化方面的落后，而成为共产主义建设的积极的战士。
    苏联在最近十年扫除文盲和半文盲工作的成就，就在许多从文盲和半文盲学校毕业的学生都有了高度的政治觉悟和丰富的科学知识，他们其中有很多在工厂、制造厂、矿山、矿场和集体农场中发生积极的作用，把所获得知识与实际的生产经验连系起来。他们很多人做了优秀的斯塔哈诺夫运动者，在社会主义建设各项工作中起了模范的作用。
    在整个扫除文盲工作的过程中，负责教育工作的机构，苏维埃的教师，知识分子，先进的工人和集体农场的工作人员，共产党党员，共产主义青年团员，职工会，都尽过最大的努力，并获得了重大的成果。特别是当时所组织的一支强大的文化军和苏维埃的教师们。文化军是不取任何报酬的，深入工厂，农村，到各部门中去教育文盲，帮助他们学习，解答许多有关的问题。一九四○年在俄罗斯社会主义联盟共和国参加工作的文化军，有三十万人。一九四○年至一九四一年，在靼鞑尔社会主义自治共和国里有一万二千五百六十人。中等学校教师参加工作的有七千人之多。这些教师在扫除文盲的工作中是最好、最适宜的工作者，因为他们本身具有丰富的教学经验，理解教学的方法，并且还可以帮助其他的文化军。他们对于自己学校的学生，非常了解，根据每个学生的具体情况，施以适当的启发和教导。
    这个时期内，苏联的工业和农业已经达到高度的发展，人民的生活和文化水平，普遍提高了，每一个青年人，尤其是工农子女，都有了受正规教育的机会。因此工人大学和成人学校便日渐减少了。
    在伟大的卫国战争时期，苏联许多青年男女，激于爱国主义的热忱，纷纷离开学校到各工厂、和各机关里去参加工作。在战争结束后，苏联政府为了这批青年能够受到完整的教育，在一九四三年设立了工人青年学校和农村青年学校，前者是为工人而设立的，后者的对象是农民。这两种学校都是正规学校，课程与普通中学一样。
    工人青年学校，是由五、六、七年级三班组成的七年制学校（初级四班除外），另外是由五年级起至十年级组成的中学。这些学校，专收在工厂、工场、矿山和企业里工作的十五岁至二十五岁的男女青年。
    课程按照苏联七年制学校和普通中学的纲领，进行讲授。男女同校，为照顾到工厂里作工的青年的学习时间，分为晨、午、晚三班上课，每班以廿人为限，其教学的组织和方法，与普通中学有所不同，按照一九四六年新规定的教学计划，每周授课十六小时，讨论研究四小时，总共二十小时（七年制学校和中学的五年级至十年级授课时间为三十二小时）。每年夏季，也和普通学校一样，有两个月的假期。课程包括：俄语（文学讲读与文学）、算术、代数、几何、三角、自然、历史、苏联宪法、地理、物理、天文学、化学、外国文、制图等。虽然授课的钟点，比普通学校为少，但是这并不妨碍青年工人充分地吸取七年制学校和中等学校的教材。主要的原因是因为：（一）在工人青年学校里学习的青年人，本身已多少具有生活方面的经验，对于知识的渴求，怀着极大的热望，对于任何困难，有决心、有毅力去克服它。其中有很多是工厂、矿山、矿场中优秀的青年斯达哈诺夫运动者，他们已经认识了工作与学习的重要性及怎样去完成自己重大的任务。（二）善于在繁忙的工作中去找寻学习的时间，利用每一分钟去学习学校的课程，勤奋地自修，同志之间，发展自我批评，互相帮助，并经常地展开讨论。他们知道把知识与实际生活联系起来。又因为每班只限二十人，教师教授时可以顾及到全体。所以苏联工人青年学校毕业生的成绩，是非常优秀的。
    一九四三至一九四四年，单单在俄罗斯共和国里，就有工人青年学校一千零八十八所，学生十万人，而一九四六年学校数增至二千零一所，学生三十二万四千七百七十人。
    一九四六年单在俄罗斯共和国修完工人青年学校的就有一万零十八人，而修完工人青年学校七年级的有三万一千零十六人。
    一九四四年七月六日，苏联政府决议在各大乡村及各集体农场设立农村青年学校，使农村青年获得正规的教育。
    农村青年学校有两种形式：一种是有一年级至四年级的初级学校；另一种是有一年级至七年级的七年制学校。如果某一地的学生数量不足以开办农村青年学校时，那就组成个别的夜班。农村青年学校受各加盟共和国教育部之管辖，并受地方国民教育机关之领导。这些学校，均采用本民族语言教学。教育部和地方国民教育机关帮助学校选聘教员，供给教科书、图书、仪器及学校必需文具。
    农村青年学校，招收十四岁至二十五岁男女青年及少年，并使其不脱离农业生产而受到完整的教育。授课时间都是在工作完毕之后。每年开学，自十一月一日起至第二年五月，因为五月一日至十月底正是农忙的时节，农村青年没有时间来上课。农村学校学生毕业时，需经过考试，及格者应给毕业证书，可以继续深造。
    一九四七年，在俄罗斯共和国的农村青年学校求学的在二十万人以上。
    工人青年学校和农村青年学校是苏联成人教育的另一方式，这些学校毕业后，得升入完全中学的第八年级或中等职业学校、师范学校或医科学校。经过数个阶段可升入大学及专科学校。
    苏联的扫除文盲工作，曾经走过三十年的长途，苏联政府和党一直遵循着伟大的列宁、斯大林关于扫除文盲工作的指示，在长期工作的过程中不断地改进教学的方法，提高工作的质量，从而顺利地完成了这一重大的任务。
    苏联的扫除文盲工作，在最初一个阶段是号召所有的文盲要学习识字和养成写作的能力，第二个阶段是提高工人和农民的文化水平，第三个阶段是把工人和农民的文化科学水平提高到与技术专家同样的水平上去。
    在教学制度上最大的特点，就是以业余的时间受正规的教育，业余学校毕业的学生，在国家教育制度上，享有与普通学校毕业生同样的权利，可以升入大学或专门学校。教师讲授和学生学习的态度都是非常严肃而认真。教育文盲的工作中并注意思想政治教育，因为扫除文盲的工作就是一种政治教育的工作，在任何课程中，以科学的唯物主义，以人民的爱国主义教育文盲，使他们成为真正为人民服务的苏维埃新的知识分子。
    苏联的扫除文盲工作的经验已经证明，这是一个需要相当长久的时间，需要很大耐心的工作。
    现在，苏联全国识字的人，占全部人口百分之九十以上，成人的文盲已经绝迹，只有一些少数年纪太大的人是文盲。一九四九年苏联政府规定，每一个人不但有受教育的权利而且要强迫受七年制的教育，不论是在城市或农村，一律普遍实行七年制的强迫教育。另外在最近几年内，一定要完成这样的任务，就是除了七年制的学校之外，一定要把十年制的学校，也成为强迫教育，全国各地都要实行十年制的强迫教育，每一个人一定要受十年教育。
    一九五○年，苏联政府在发展文化事业和城市及乡村劳动者的保健事业方面的国家支出，预计为一千零六百亿卢布，比一九四○年高出二·六倍。
