Tianjin Workers' Spare-Time School Training Class
Training Over a Hundred Worker-Teachers to Embark on Their Jobs

[This newspaper report] To vigorously promote worker education, the Tianjin Municipal Education Bureau and the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions jointly organized a training class for teachers of workers' spare-time schools, which began on February 4th and ended on February 15th. A total of 138 students participated in this study. Most were out-of-school and unemployed youth who had registered with the Tianjin Education Union and passed the examination, and some were teachers drawn from current positions in spare-time schools. These students, coming from different posts and different regions, with different motivations for enrollment, have begun to understand Marxism-Leninism and are moving towards serving the people after only a dozen days of study. At the beginning of the semester, some students were afraid to speak at group discussions, fearing that saying something wrong would affect their career; some concealed their class origins; some concealed their history; some had incorrect political understandings; and some were arrogant, self-righteous, unappreciative of learning, and dishonest. However, after reports on "The Current Situation and Tasks," "Revolutionary Worldview," and "A Brief History of the Labor Movement," and after ideological summaries, everyone underwent preliminary ideological transformation through self-criticism and mutual criticism. At the same time, the past belief that collective life was bitter and that learning was a difficult hurdle was shattered. At the end of the course, everyone was reluctant to part, feeling that the study time was too short. In addition, cadres and students were able to unite well. The cadres were conscientious and responsible, and carried out targeted education based on the students' thoughts. At the graduation ceremony, Han Youtong, Director of the Tianjin Municipal Education Bureau, particularly pointed out these gains and gave sincere words of advice to the students: First, they must maintain an attitude of "learning, learning, and learning again," and not be complacent; second, "How can one's work be guaranteed?" That depends on whether one can truly serve the people; third, when working among the masses, one must completely discard the burden of arrogance and must humbly learn from the workers. Now, the graduating students are all happily preparing to embark on their jobs and welcome new work tasks.

　　津工人业余学校师训班
    训练百余工人教师即将踏上工作岗位
    【本报讯】为了大力开展工人教育，天津市教育局和市总工会联合主办的工人业余学校师资训练班，于二月四日开始，到二月十五日已告结束。这次参加学习的学员共一三八人。大部是曾在天津市教联登记经过考试及格的失学失业青年，一部是抽调现职的业余学校教师。这些来自不同的岗位，不同的地区，怀着不同入学动机的学员，经过短短十几天的学习，已经开始了解马列主义，走向为人民服务的道路。在刚开学的时候，一部分学员在小组讨论会上不敢发言，怕说错了影响职业；有的人隐瞒成份；也有的隐瞒历史；有的存在着错误的政治认识；有的自高自大，自以为是，不虚心，不老实。可是经过“目前形势与任务”、“革命人生观”、“工运简史”各项问题的报告和思想总结之后，大家在自我检讨和相互批评之下，思想都有了初步的转变。同时，把过去以为集体生活很苦，把学习当作难关的思想都打破了。在结业的时候，大家都不愿分开，感到学习时间太短。此外，干部和学员之间，大家都能很好的团结。干部们认真负责，针对学员的思想进行了对症下药的教育。在结业典礼上，津市教育局韩幽桐局长特别指出这些收获，并对学员作了恳切的赠言：第一要抱着“学习、学习、再学习”的态度，不要自满；第二、“怎样工作才有保障”？那要看自己是不是真能为人民服务；第三、到群众中间去工作，要彻底丢掉自高自大的包袱，必须很虚心的向工人学习。现在，结业学员都很愉快的准备踏上工作岗位，迎接新的工作任务。
