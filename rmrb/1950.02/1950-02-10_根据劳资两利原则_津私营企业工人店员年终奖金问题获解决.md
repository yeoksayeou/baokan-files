Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, 8th. The issue of year-end bonuses for workers and shop employees in Tianjin's private enterprises has been basically resolved. The Municipal People's Government Labor Bureau conducted an in-depth investigation into the year-end bonus situation of thirteen industries a month ago. Under the principle of taking care of workers' livelihoods and capital's business, and based on the old year-end bonus practices of various industries and the adjustment of workers' wages last year, it stipulated measures for handling year-end bonuses in private enterprises. These measures stipulate that generally no new precedents should be set for those without old precedents; those who have signed collective contracts should implement them according to the contracts; enterprises whose wages have not changed since liberation should generally follow the old precedents; enterprises whose wages have increased should negotiate solutions based on the business situation and the amount of wage increase; and those with poor business and the capital truly unable to afford it can negotiate reductions or exemptions. The measures also stipulate that after labor and capital reach an agreement, it must be submitted to the Labor Bureau for approval and implementation. According to this spirit, and with the assistance of the Labor Bureau and the participation of trade unions at all levels, in commerce, major industries such as silk and cloth, hardware, and department stores have reached agreements through labor-capital representatives and signed contracts for handling year-end bonuses. In industry, Hengyuan, Beiyang, Dasheng and other three major yarn factories, under the proactive care of the labor side for the factory's operational difficulties, have also reached agreements with the capital side to distribute year-end bonuses in five grades based on employee skills. Shoufeng, Fuxing in the flour industry, and Yitang Rubber Factory in the chemical industry have referred to old precedents and, based on this year's business situation, have reached reasonable solutions through labor-capital consultation. The carpet and tobacco industries have independently resolved the issue based on the industry collective contracts that have been signed. As of now, the year-end bonus issues of more than 3,000 industrial and commercial households in Tianjin have been satisfactorily resolved, and other factories and households are also actively working on it.

　　In the process of labor-capital consultation to resolve the year-end bonus issue, some deviations have occurred in certain industries. For example, some capitalists only issue year-end bonuses to employees and not to workers; some store capitalists planned to openly issue year-end bonuses but secretly withdraw funds, attempting to use financial difficulties as a reason after the Spring Festival to propose firing workers or ceasing operations; some shop employees and workers, disregarding business development, had the idea of "grabbing a quick buck." After explanations and education by the Labor Bureau and the trade unions, both labor and capital have further recognized the labor-capital benefit policy, and generally, they can prioritize the development of enterprises, so that the year-end bonus issue can be reasonably resolved.

　　根据劳资两利原则
    津私营企业工人店员年终奖金问题获解决
    【新华社天津八日电】天津市私营企业工人、店员年终奖金问题已基本解决。市人民政府劳动局月前曾深入调查了十三个行业年奖情况，在照顾工人生活和资方营业的方针下，根据各行业年奖旧例及去年工人工资调整情况，曾规定了私营企业年奖处理办法。该办法规定凡过去无旧例者一般不开新例；已订立集体合同者，即按合同执行；解放后工资未经变动之企业，年奖一般仍照旧例办事；工资已增加者则双方依营业好坏及工资增加之多少，协商解决；凡营业不好，资方确实无力负担者，双方可协商减免。该办法并规定劳资双方取得协议后，须呈劳动局批准执行。根据这一精神并在劳动局协助各级工会参加下，在商业中，绸布、五金、百货等较大行业已由劳资双方代表协议，订立年奖处理办法合同，在工业中，恒源、北洋、达生等三大纱厂，在劳方主动照顾厂方经营困难的情况下，亦已与资方商妥，按职工技术为标准，分五级发放年奖。面粉业寿丰、福星及化学业义堂橡胶厂等已参照旧例，并根据今年营业情况，由劳资协商获得合理解决，地毯、烟草业则以行业为单位，根据已签订之行业集体合同，自行解决。截至目前止，津市已有三千余家工商业户之年奖问题获得圆满解决，其他各厂户亦均在积极进行中。
    在劳资协商解决年奖问题过程中，某些行业曾发生过一些偏向。如有些资方只发年奖给职员，不发给工人；有些商店的资方曾打算明发年奖、暗抽资金，企图春节后以资金困难为理由，提出解雇工人或停止营业；也有部分店员、工人，不顾业务发展而存有“现捞一把”的想法。经劳动局及工会解释教育后，劳资双方已进一步地认识了劳资两利政策，一般都能以发展企业为重，使年奖问题得以获得合理解决。
