　　Organize Rural Youth to Take the Lead in Studying Culture
At present, due to the transition from a wartime environment to peaceful construction, and with the gradual recovery and development of the rural economy after land reform, learning culture has become the urgent need of young people. Currently, one of the most popular, active, and persistent organizations in rural areas is the youth study organization. Wherever learning is done well, the work of the Communist Youth League is very active. Therefore, from now on, developing cultural learning should be one of the main tasks of the Communist Youth League in various places. It is necessary to solve problems such as the organizational form of learning, learning materials, learning methods, learning funds, and teachers; and gradually establish systems such as examinations, tests, and upgrades in learning, so as to eliminate illiteracy in a planned and step-by-step manner. Use the youth's learning enthusiasm to influence and promote the learning of the entire masses.

　　组织农村青年带头学习文化
    目前由于从战争环境转入了和平建设，土地改革后农村经济逐渐恢复和发展，学习文化便首先成为青年的迫切要求。现在农村最受欢迎、最活跃、最能坚持的组织之一，就是青年学习组织。凡把学习搞好的地方，团的工作就很活跃。因此，今后应把开展文化学习，作为各地团的主要工作内容之一。要解决学习的组织形式，学习材料，学习方法，学习经费，教员等问题；逐渐树立学习中的考试、测验、升级等制度，作到有计划、有步骤地扫除文盲。以青年的学习热潮，影响与推动整个群众的学习。
