    The play "Growing Up in Battle," recently performed by the North China Military Region Cultural Troupe, is a four-act, five-scene drama. Like other plays performed by the troupe's predecessor, the Anti-Enemy Drama Society, it reflects the lives of soldiers.

    "Growing Up in Battle" tells the story of Zhao Tiezhu and his son, Shi Tou, peasants who suffered persecution under landlords and local bullies in the old society, leading to the destruction of their family and their separate departures to join the People's Liberation Army. Later, Zhao Tiezhu became a cadre (battalion commander), while his son, Shi Tou, was recuperating from injuries. Upon returning to his unit, he found that it had moved south, and he happened to rejoin his father's unit. Separated for thirteen years, father and son did not recognize each other. When the unit attacked Shi Tou's hometown, Shi Tou acted on his own to avenge himself, and Battalion Commander Zhao Tiezhu called him back. After persuasion and education, he was given a task. Finally, the battle ended, and the father, son, and wife were reunited.

    Through this story, people can understand where the Chinese People's Liberation Army came from. Like Zhao Tiezhu and his son, they were honest peasants forced to join the Liberation Army, having no place to live due to oppression by landlords and local bullies. This is the path taken by many PLA soldiers, and it can also be said to be the path of oppression and liberation sought by the vast number of peasants in that era.

    Secondly, this play vividly introduces the growth process of Zhao Tiezhu and his son (especially Shi Tou), and it also explains why the Liberation Army soldiers are so resolute and brave and able to achieve victory.

    Simply having the idea of revenge is not the same as understanding the revolution. In this play, revenge is an important motive for Shi Tou to join the Liberation Army, but if he stops at this narrow view of revenge, it is far from enough. Therefore, in the second act, the author clearly raises this issue, arranging for Shi Tou's father, Zhao Tiezhu, to have been tempered by revolutionary struggle in these thirteen years and grown into a cadre who understands class hatred and obeys class interests. In the third act, when Shi Tou disobeys discipline in order to avenge personal grudges, Zhao Tiezhu persuades and educates him, raising his class consciousness, which is very powerful. Shi Tou begins to understand that revenge must rely on everyone and must be organized, led, and disciplined. At this time, he moves from the psychology of avenging personal grudges to recognizing the truth of the revolution, and he can then be more courageous in completing his task. Therefore, developing to the fourth act, when another messenger, Si Hai, bravely sacrifices himself, Shi Tou has long abandoned the idea of merely avenging personal grudges and shouts, "Si Hai, I will avenge you!" At this point, the author completes the development process of Shi Tou's character and completes the final step of the main theme, "Growing Up in Battle."

    The author is familiar with military life. But if you want to show everything because of this, you may lose the focus. For example, the play mentions uniting new soldiers, earning merits in battle, etc., which are naturally related to the theme, but too many issues weaken the portrayal of the theme's ideas. If the less important parts are compressed a bit, it may make the whole play more concise and leave a deeper impression on the audience.

　　《战斗里成长》
    华北军区文工团集体创作胡可改作
　　宋玳
    最近华北军区文工团演出的《战斗里成长》，是一个四幕五场的话剧，它像军区文工团的前身抗敌剧社所演出的其他的戏一样，是反映部队生活的。
    《战斗里成长》的故事是描写农民赵铁柱父子，在旧社会里，受尽地主恶霸的迫害，弄得家破人亡，先后出走，参加了解放军。后来，赵铁柱成了干部（营长），而他的儿子名叫石头的负伤休养。归队时，本部队已南下，刚好回到他父亲所在的部队来。十三年的相隔，父子见面并不相识。当部队在攻打石头的家乡时，石头为了报自己的仇，自由行动起来，被营长赵铁柱叫回，经说服教育后，给他以任务。最后，战斗结束，父子夫妻团聚。
    通过这个故事，人们可以了解中国人民解放军是从那儿来的。如赵铁柱父子，都是老实的农民，被地主恶霸逼得无地容身，但他们没有屈服，英勇地参加了解放军。这是许多解放军战士所走过的路，也可以说是在这个时代里，广大农民被压迫和求解放的道路。
    其次，这个剧形像地介绍了赵铁柱父子（尤其是石头）的成长过程，也说明了解放军战士为什么这样坚决勇敢，能取得胜利的道理。
    单单有了报仇的念头，还不等于懂得革命。在这剧本中，报仇是石头参加解放军的一个重要动机，但如果停留在这种狭隘的报仇观点上，是非常不够的。因此，在第二幕，作者就明确地提出了这问题，安排了石头的父亲赵铁柱，在这十三年中，受着革命斗争的锻炼，已成长为一个懂得阶级仇恨，服从阶级利益的干部。到第三幕，当石头为了报个人的仇而不服从纪律时，由赵铁柱来说服教育他，提高了他阶级觉悟，这是非常有力的。石头开始懂得了报仇必须依靠大家，并要有组织，有领导，有纪律。他这时就从报复个人仇恨的心理，进而认识到革命的道理，他才能更勇敢地去完成任务。因此，发展到第四幕，当另一个通讯员四海壮烈牺牲时，石头早就抛开了仅仅为个人报仇的思想，而高呼“四海，我替你报仇！”这时，作者完成了石头这个人物的发展过程，也完成了主要的“战斗里成长”的最后一步。
    作者对部队生活是熟悉的。但如果因此想把什么都表现出来，反而会失去重点。如剧中所提出的团结新战士，火线立功等等，自然都与主题有关，但问题太多，反使表现主题思想的描划削弱了。如果把不太重要的部分压缩一下，也许会使全剧更简练些，给观众的印象会更深刻些。
