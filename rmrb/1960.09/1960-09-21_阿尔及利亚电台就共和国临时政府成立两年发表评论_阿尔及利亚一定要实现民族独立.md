　　Algiers Radio Comments on the Second Anniversary of the Establishment of the Provisional Government of the Republic
　　Algeria Must Achieve National Independence
Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, September 19th. Algerian Republic Radio tonight broadcast a commentary on the second anniversary of the establishment of the Provisional Government of the Algerian Republic, saying that September 19, 1958, would be one of the most glorious days in the history of the Algerian people's national struggle against French imperialism.
    The commentary said that despite the presence of one million French soldiers on Algerian territory attempting to suppress the Algerian revolution, and despite the support of the United States and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization for the war waged by French imperialism in Algeria, the Algerian people resolutely established their own legitimate government—the Provisional Government of the Algerian Republic—to demonstrate its existence. The commentary then stated that the significance of the establishment of the Algerian Provisional Government lies in demonstrating that national independence is a goal that Algerians will never abandon.
    The commentary concluded: "The Algerian government was established to lead the Algerian people in crushing French rule and achieving independence, and to express its determination to carry on the struggle until the goal is achieved. The Algerian government will never deviate from the path opened up by the blood of the martyrs in striving for independence, freedom, and complete sovereignty."

　  阿尔及利亚电台就共和国临时政府成立两年发表评论
　　阿尔及利亚一定要实现民族独立 　 新华社开罗19日电　阿尔及利亚共和国之声电台今晚就阿尔及利亚共和国临时政府成立两周年发表评论说，1958年9月19日这一天将是阿尔及利亚人民反对法国帝国主义的民族斗争史上的最光荣的日子之一。
    评论说，尽管在阿尔及利亚领土上有一百万法国兵企图镇压阿尔及利亚革命，尽管美国和北大西洋公约组织支持法帝国主义在阿尔及利亚进行的战争，阿尔及利亚人民毅然成立自己的合法政府——阿尔及利亚共和国临时政府，来显示它的存在。评论接着说，成立阿尔及利亚临时政府的重要意义在于表明：民族独立是阿尔及利亚人决不放弃的目的。
    评论最后说：“成立阿尔及利亚政府，是为了领导阿尔及利亚人民粉碎法国的统治和实现独立，并表示决心把斗争进行下去，直到达到目的为止。阿尔及利亚政府决不离开由烈士们的鲜血所开拓的道路，来争取实现独立、自由和完整的主权。”
