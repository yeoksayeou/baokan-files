Changtong People's Commune Actively Supports Steel Production

The Changtong People's Commune in Nanguan District, Changchun City, concentrates its efforts to actively support steel production from its commune-run industry, transportation, and service sectors.

The workers of the commune's hardware factory actively carried out technical innovations while rushing to produce steel ingot tongs and various screws, exceeding the processing plan every month. In the second quarter, the plan was to produce 200 pairs of tongs, but 500 pairs were completed, meeting the needs of the steel plant's production. The product quality was also very good. The commune-run hardware factory undertook the task of repairing steel beams for the steel plant. The workers changed from one shift to two shifts, completing the task originally scheduled for five days in two and a half days.

In addition, the commune also supports steel production from transportation and service aspects. The commune's transportation station extracted 35 handcarts to transport more than 800 tons of steel ingots, cylinder bricks, and coke for the steel plant; the service department established a service team, canteen, and sewing group near the steel plant to serve the lives of the steel plant workers.

Shandong Vigorously Helps Advanced Producers Improve Their Level

Shandong Province vigorously organizes advanced producers to study and helps them improve their political, cultural, and technical levels in all aspects.

Two hundred and fifty-two representatives who attended the 1959 National Conference of Heroes and provincial-level advanced producers participated in correspondence school studies specially organized for them by Shandong University. Shandong Institute of Technology established a special study and research class, organizing 37 advanced producers who attended the 1959 National Conference of Heroes to study. These two schools also held two short-term training courses in Qingdao and Zibo, absorbing advanced producers to participate in learning. All parts of the province and all departments have also adopted methods of grading, phasing, and batching to organize advanced producers to study.

Guangdong Strengthens Leadership over Rural Hospitals

In order to meet the needs of vigorously developing agriculture, Guangdong Province has recently implemented a system in which medical personnel from provincial, special district, and city-level hospitals take turns going to the countryside for half a year to a year to strengthen the technical force and construction work of rural hospitals.

After urban doctors go down to the countryside, a counterpart exchange method is adopted, that is, county and commune hospitals transfer doctors to urban hospitals to work and study. After the implementation of this system, a group of more experienced doctors can often go to the countryside to focus on strengthening the work of rural hospitals. At the same time, rural doctors also have the opportunity to study and quickly improve their professional level.

Shuguang Radio Factory Promotes Production, Education, and Scientific Research Mutually

The close combination of production, spare-time education, and scientific research in the Shuguang Radio Factory in Guangzhou promotes and facilitates each other, with good results.

After the spare-time school further combined with production and scientific research, the teaching methods became more flexible and diverse. In addition to classroom teaching, they also held scientific research paper report meetings, and sometimes went to workshops and laboratories to teach, explain various advanced experiences, and demonstrate advanced operations. Teachers further raised these experiences and research results to theoretical explanations. This approach has a good effect and is very popular among workers.

After the close combination of production, education, and scientific research, the factory's production and spare-time education have been further changed. All employees of the factory universally participate in scientific research activities, and the factory has established a regular scientific research system. Since the beginning of this year, all employees of the factory have completed more than 40 scientific research projects, some of which have reached a high level. In the final examination of the spare-time school last semester, the number of students with excellent grades reached 90 percent. It has also had a positive impact on the development of production. By the end of August, the factory's main product—the production of amplifiers—had completed the annual plan, the percentage of qualified products reached 100 percent, and the cost was reduced by 10 percent compared to last year.

Jiangxi Chongren Cadres Go Deep into the Front Line and Reap Rich Harvests

The vast majority of rural cadres in Chongren County, Jiangxi, spend more than two-thirds of their time participating in field labor. By participating in production to lead production, they have strengthened the relationship between cadres and the masses, and promoted the current autumn field management to advance vigorously and solidly.

Before and after the Party's call for vigorously developing agriculture and grain, Chongren County successively transferred a total of 490 county and commune cadres, accounting for 57.2% of the total number of county and commune cadres, to go deep into the grassroots to participate in production and lead production.

Because the Party committee has a tight and detailed grasp of cadres' participation in production, all rural cadres in the county regard participation in production as a prerequisite for leading production well, and compete to go to the most difficult tasks to take the lead in production and labor, set an example, and drive the masses. They generally work during the day and study at night. County, commune, and brigade cadres hold meetings, study, and research work for three, two, and one days a week, respectively, so that participation in production and leadership of production are closely combined, preventing the tendency to only take care of one end and lose the other.

    长通公社积极支援钢铁生产
    长春市南关区长通人民公社，集中力量，从社办工业、运输和服务事业方面积极支援钢铁生产。
    公社五金厂的职工在赶制钢锭钳子和各种螺丝时，积极开展技术革新，月月超额完成加工计划，第二季度计划生产二百把钳子，结果完成五百把，满足了钢厂生产需要，产品质量也很好。社办五金厂为钢厂担任修理钢梁的任务，职工们把一班生产改为两班生产，用两天半的时间完成了原定五天完成的任务。
    此外，公社还从运输、服务事业等方面来支援钢铁生产。公社的运输站抽出三十五台手推车，为钢厂运输了钢锭、缸砖、焦炭等物资八百多吨；服务部门在钢厂附近建立了服务队、食堂、缝纫组，为钢厂职工的生活服务。
    山东大力帮助先进生产者提高水平
    山东省大力组织先进生产者学习，从各方面帮助他们提高政治、文化和技术水平。
    二百五十二名曾经出席1959年全国群英会的代表和省级先进生产者，参加了山东大学特别为他们举办的函授学校学习。山东工学院成立了专门的学习研究班，组织曾经出席1959年全国群英会的先进生产者三十七人学习。这两个学校还在青岛、淄博两市举办了两个短期训练班，吸收先进生产者参加学习。全省各地、各部门也都采取分级分期分批的办法，来组织先进生产者学习。
    广东加强对农村医院的领导
    为了适应大办农业的需要，广东省最近实行省、专区、市一级医院的医务人员轮流下乡半年到一年的制度，以加强农村医院的技术力量和建设工作。
    城市医生下去后，采取对口调换的办法，即由县和公社医院调医生到城市医院边工作、边进修。实行这种制度后，就可以经常有一部分较有经验的医生到农村去，有重点地加强农村医院的工作。同时，农村医生也有进修的机会，迅速地提高业务水平。
    曙光无线电厂生产教育科学研究互相促进
    广州市曙光无线电厂生产、业余教育和科学研究紧密结合，互相推动，互相促进，效果很好。
    业余学校进一步结合生产和科学研究以后，在教学方法上也更加灵活多样。他们除了课堂教学以外，还举办科学研究论文报告会，有时还到车间和实验室去上课，讲解各项先进经验，表演先进操作，教师进一步把这些经验和研究成果提高到理论上来说明。这种做法效果很好，很受工人欢迎。
    生产、教育、科学研究紧密结合以后，进一步改变工厂的生产和业余教育面貌。全厂职工普遍参加科学研究活动，工厂建立起经常性的科学研究制度。今年以来，全厂职工已经完成了四十多项科学研究项目，有些已经达到了较高的水平。业余学校上学期期终考试，成绩优良的学员达到百分之九十。对生产的发展更是产生了良好影响。到8月底，工厂的主要产品——扩音机的产量已完成全年计划，正品率达到百分之一百，成本比去年降低了百分之十。
    江西崇仁干部深入第一线收获丰硕
    江西崇仁县绝大部分农村干部做到了以三分之二以上的时间参加田间劳动，通过参加生产来领导生产，密切了干群关系，带动了当前秋田管理既轰轰烈烈又扎扎实实地向前推进。
    崇仁县在党的大办农业、大办粮食的号召发出前后，先后共下放了占县社干部总数57.2％的四百九十名县、公社干部深入基层参加生产，领导生产。
    由于党委对干部参加生产抓得紧、抓得细，因而全县农村干部都把参加生产作为领导好生产的前提，争相到任务最艰巨的地方去带头生产劳动，作出榜样，带动群众。他们一般都做到了白天劳动、晚上研究工作，县、公社、大队干部在一星期内，分别有三天、两天、一天开会、学习、研究工作，因而使参加生产和领导生产紧密结合，防止了只顾这头，丢掉另一头的倾向。
