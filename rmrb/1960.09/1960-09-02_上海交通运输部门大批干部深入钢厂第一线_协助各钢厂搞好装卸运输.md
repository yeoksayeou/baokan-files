Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, September 1st. A large number of leading cadres from Shanghai's transportation departments are taking the initiative to go deep into the front lines of steel plant production, arranging transportation according to production needs to ensure that the steelmaking furnaces are well-fed and well-supplied. In addition to the Party Committee Secretary and the Director of the First Transportation Bureau going to the steel plants three to four times a week, thirty team leaders and section chiefs and above have been dispatched to the city's steel plant joint dispatching stations. The leading cadres of the convoys transporting steelmaking materials have moved their offices to the steel plants. Leading cadres from the Shanghai Railway Bureau and the Shanghai Railway Office have also recently led three work groups to the steel plants to help organize transportation work.

An important measure for transportation department leading cadres to organize transportation and production collaboration in steel plants is to strengthen the leadership of the steel plant's automobile joint dispatching station, so that it can give full play to its role. Transportation department personnel stationed at the station hold daily balance meetings with cadres from the steel plant's supply and marketing department and transportation department to understand the production progress of each workshop, the required amount of raw materials, and the source of goods. They also participate in relevant Party committee meetings of the steel plant to jointly study production plans and arrange transportation. Because this joint dispatching station can closely grasp the production situation of the steel plant, it makes the transportation of steelmaking materials timely, rapid, and proactive. In the previous period, the pig iron in the steel plant's blast furnace contained a high sulfur content, so the transportation department took the initiative to transport more desulfurization materials such as lime and soda ash, and at the same time increased the number of vehicles and manpower for transporting slag to meet production needs.

In order to meet the needs of the continuous development of steel production, the Transportation Bureau and the steel plant agreed to change the team's residence from the parking lot to the factory. At present, dozens of convoys (groups) consisting of more than 700 trucks specializing in the transportation of steelmaking materials have all been stationed at the production sites of Shanghai's steel plants.

Another important measure for transportation departments to help steel plants further develop in-plant transportation is transportation and production collaboration. Because the volume of steelmaking materials transported this year has greatly increased, the steel plant's own transportation, loading, unloading, raw material yard management, and other resources could not keep up with production needs for a time. After the leading cadres of the transportation department went to the factory, they took various measures to help improve the situation. Under the leadership of the Transportation Work Department of the Municipal Party Committee, leading cadres from the railway, port, and truck transportation departments established a joint planning group with the Shanghai No. 1, No. 3, and No. 5 Steel Plants to jointly formulate an overall transformation plan including the connection of internal and external transportation, the rational planning of material yards, and the arrangement of transportation routes between workshops, which has now begun to be implemented. A work group composed of leading cadres from the Shanghai Railway Bureau and three engineers is helping the Shanghai No. 1 Steel Plant build a railway directly to the workshop. They also help the steel plant check the quality of the original railway siding and help the steel plant repair locomotives. The Party Committee Secretary of the Automobile Transportation Yard No. 1 discovered that the road surface of the Shanghai No. 1 Steel Plant was uneven, so he organized more than 130 cadres to help the steel plant repair the road together. In order to support the steel plant's loading and unloading, the Shanghai Railway Office transferred a batch of loading and unloading workers to support the Shanghai No. 1 Steel Plant in strengthening in-plant unloading work for a long time.

### 上海交通运输部门大批干部深入钢厂第一线  协助各钢厂搞好装卸运输

    上海交通运输部门大批干部深入钢厂第一线
    协助各钢厂搞好装卸运输
    由七百多辆卡车组成的几十个运输组全部到达各厂听候调动
    新华社上海1日电　上海各交通运输部门大批领导干部主动深入钢厂生产第一线，根据生产需要安排运输，保证炼钢炉吃得饱、吃得好。第一交通运输局除开党委书记和局长每周下钢厂三至四次外，还抽出三十名车队长和科长以上的领导骨干分驻全市各个钢厂联合调度站。运输炼钢物资的车队领导干部已搬到钢厂办公。上海铁路总局和上海铁路办事处的领导干部，最近也率领三个工作组下到钢厂，帮助组织运输工作。
    运输部门领导干部到钢厂组织运、产协作的一项重要措施，是加强对钢厂汽车联合调度站的领导，使它充分发挥作用。运输部门驻站干部，每天同钢厂供销部、运输部干部一起开平衡会议，掌握各车间的生产进度、原材料需要量，以及货源等情况。他们还参加钢厂的有关党委会议，共同研究生产计划，安排运输。这种联合调度站，由于能密切掌握钢厂生产情况，因此，使炼钢物资运输做到了及时、迅速、主动。前一时期，钢厂化铁炉的生铁含硫较多，运输部门就主动多调运去硫材料石灰和纯碱，同时增派运渣的车辆和人力，满足了生产需要。
    为了适应钢铁生产不断发展的需要，交通运输局和钢厂协议，将原来车队驻在车场改为驻厂。目前，专门运输炼钢物资的由七百多辆卡车组成的数十个车队（小组），已经全部驻到上海各钢厂生产现场。
    运输部门帮助钢厂进一步开展厂内运输，是运、产协作的另一重要措施。由于今年炼钢物资运量大大增加，钢厂本身的运输、装卸力量和原材料场地管理一时跟不上生产需要。运输部门领导干部下厂后，针对这一情况，多方着手帮助改进。铁路、港务、卡车等运输部门领导干部在市委交通工作部的领导下，同上钢一厂、三厂、五厂成立了联合规划小组，共同制订包括厂内外运输衔接、合理规划料场、安排车间之间运输线路等内容的总体改造规划，现已开始实行。由上海铁路总局领导干部和三位工程师等组成的工作组，正在帮助上钢一厂修建直通车间的铁路。他们还帮助钢厂检查原有铁路专用线的质量，帮助钢厂修理机车。汽车运输一场党委书记发现上钢一厂的路面高低不平，便组织一百三十多个干部协助钢厂一起修路。为了支援钢厂装卸，上海铁路办事处抽调了一批装卸工人，长期支援上钢一厂加强厂内卸货工作。（附图片）
