Xinhua News Agency, Bonn - Following the provocative rally held by West German militarists and revanchists in West Berlin in early September, many cities in West Germany have also held so-called "Homeland Day" revanchist activities in recent days.

Participating in these activities were revanchist organizations such as the so-called "Central German United Compatriot Association," "Sudeten German Refugee Association," "German Homeland and Nature Protection Work Association," and "German Homeland Association."

These revanchist gatherings received active support and encouragement from governments at all levels in West Germany.

At the gatherings of revanchists held in cities in the states of Rhineland-Palatinate and Lower Saxony, as well as in Hamburg, Bremen, and other places, ministers of the states, mayors, and members of parliament from the ruling Christian Democratic Union attended and spoke.

The West German militarist organization "Afrika Korps Association" held its "Seventh Federal Congress" in Münster on the 10th and 11th. Attending the meeting were 7,000 former Hitler "Wehrmacht" soldiers who had participated in Hitler's war of aggression in Africa. According to Western news agencies, the task of this congress was to "pass on the old soldierly spirit and traditions to the younger generation." The chairman of this association, former Hitler General Westphal, said in his speech that the West German people should love the current West German Federal "Defense Force" as they "loved" the past Hitler "old soldiers." West German President Lübke also sent a congratulatory telegram to the congress.

    在波恩政府的支持和庇护下
    西德复仇主义组织猖獗活动
    据新华社波恩讯　继西德军国主义和复仇主义分子9月初在西柏林举行挑衅性的集会之后，西德许多城市连日来也举行所谓纪念“家乡日”的复仇主义活动。
    参加这些活动的有所谓“中德联合同乡会”、“苏卡区难民联合会”、“德国家乡和自然保护工作联合会”、“德国家乡联合会”等复仇主义组织。
    这些复仇主义集会受到西德各级政府的积极支持和鼓励。
    在莱因—法尔茨和下萨克森州的城市以及汉堡、不来梅等地举行的复仇主义分子的集会上，分别有各州的部长、市长和执政党基督教民主联盟议员出席讲话。
    西德军国主义组织“非洲军团联合会”10日和11日两天在明斯特举行了“第七届联邦大会”，参加会议的有七千名曾参加希特勒侵略非洲战争的前希特勒“国防军”士兵。据西方通讯社报道，这次大会的任务是要“把旧有的士兵精神和传统传给青年一代”。这个联合会的主席、前希特勒将军维斯特法尔在讲话中要西德人民像“喜爱”过去希特勒的“老战士”那样喜爱现在的西德联邦“国防军”。西德总统吕布克还发给大会贺电。
