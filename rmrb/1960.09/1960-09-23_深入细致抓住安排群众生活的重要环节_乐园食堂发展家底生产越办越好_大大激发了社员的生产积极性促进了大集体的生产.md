　　New Hunan Daily News: The Leyuan Canteen of the Seventh Production Team of the Baishazhou Brigade of the Dapu Commune in Hengshan County, Hunan Province, has seized upon the development of the canteen's family property production and further improved the canteen, improved the lives of the commune members, thus greatly stimulating the production enthusiasm of the commune members and promoted the development of the great collective production, making the whole team appear in an excellent situation of "everyone's work points exceeding the quota, and every measure exceeding the standard."

　　Leyuan Canteen's establishment of family property production started in March of this year. Before this, because some cadres and commune members did not have enough understanding of the significance of the canteen establishing family property production, they were not active in establishing the canteen's family property production. Some believed that it was good to establish the canteen's family property production, but they were afraid that it would affect the great collective production, and they were afraid of picking up "sesame seeds" and losing "watermelons"; others believed that with the brigade as a reliance, they could ask the brigade for anything they lacked, and there was no need to engage in canteen family property production, and so on. As a result, the canteen still had to ask the brigade for money for oil and salt every month. This affected the production enthusiasm of the masses.

　　From this incident, the brigade Party branch realized that if they wanted to give full play to the production enthusiasm of the masses, they must arrange the lives of the masses well; to arrange the lives of the masses well, they must first run the canteen well; to run the canteen well, establishing family property production was very important. In order to solve this problem, Chen Liqing, secretary of the brigade Party branch, went to this production team and, by summarizing the experience of the canteen for more than a year and introducing examples of advanced canteens, made everyone realize the important significance of establishing family property production for running the canteen well and promoting production.

　　Next, in order to strengthen the leadership of this work, the brigade Party branch also sent Yi Juxiang, the deputy captain of the brigade's women, to the Leyuan Canteen to help get the canteen's family property production up and running. The Leyuan Canteen also sent the work group leader Ou Liying and the canteen manager Yuan Jihua and other five people to form a leading group for canteen family property production, and relied on activists to develop canteen family property production. Soon, this canteen developed from a few pigs and chickens to 30 pigs, more than 250 chickens and ducks, 10 geese, 190 rabbits, and 80 pairs of pigeons. They planted more than 37 mu of vegetables, feed, and miscellaneous grains, and raised more than 1,000 fish.

　　In dealing with and resolving the labor, land, and fertilizer use of the canteen's family property production and the great collective production, the measures taken by the Leyuan Canteen were: In terms of labor, in order not to occupy the main labor force, they formed a professional team with the ungraded auxiliary labor force. At the same time, they used the free time before and after the commune members went to work to engage in canteen family property production. In terms of land arrangement: in addition to the 12 mu of old vegetable land for planting vegetables, other vegetable land and feed land were used for planting on the site of the house and the open space. Recently, they also reclaimed 13 mu of wasteland and planted soybeans and miscellaneous grains, without occupying formal cultivated land. Reasonable arrangements were also made in terms of domestic fertilizer, stipulating that the great collective production accounted for 80％, and the canteen family property production accounted for 20％. With the development of family property production, there was more pig, chicken, and duck manure, which not only could not be used up by the canteen, but also provided 40 to 50 dan of high-quality fertilizer to the production team every month, which effectively promoted the development of the great production.

　　The development of canteen family property production has greatly improved the lives of commune members and further improved the canteen. This year, the canteen has sold five fat pigs, 80 chickens and ducks, and a batch of rabbits, and sold more than 320 eggs and more than 1,000 yuan of vegetables. Not only solved the money for oil and salt, but also added a set of cooking utensils, painted the house, and stored more than 400 yuan. Now, each commune member can eat three to four jin of fresh vegetables every day, and store more than 8,000 jin of dried vegetables, and can often eat small meat dishes and egg products, bean products and other non-staple foods.

　　Because life has been improved, the labor enthusiasm of the commune members has been unprecedentedly high. All 48 laborers in the production team are working full time every day, and 42 of them have reached the standard of "five good" commune members. Recently, they have been fully invested in the production movement centered on field management and fertilizer accumulation, determined to strive for a good harvest throughout the year. The commune members composed a folk song to praise this good canteen: "Leyuan Canteen, getting stronger and stronger, establishing family property, people prosper and wealth flourishes. Planting vegetables and raising pigs, chickens, ducks, fish and eggs, there are food and sales, and there is storage. Life is improved, production is rising, and happy days are better than 'heaven'."

　　深入细致抓住安排群众生活的重要环节
　　乐园食堂发展家底生产越办越好
　　大大激发了社员的生产积极性促进了大集体的生产
    本报讯　据新湖南日报消息：湖南省衡山县大浦公社白沙洲大队第七生产队乐园食堂，抓紧发展食
  堂家底生产，进一步办好了食堂，改善了社员生活，从而大大激发了社员的生产积极性，促进了大集体生产的发展，使全队出现了一个
  “人人工分超定额，项项措施超指标”的大好形势。
    乐园食堂建立家底生产，是从今年3月开始的。在这以前，由于部分干部和社员对食堂建立家底生产的意义认识不够，对建立食堂家底生产就不积极。有的认为建立食堂家底生产好是好，就是怕影响大集体生产，怕拣了“芝麻”丢了“西瓜”；有的又认为有大队作依靠，缺什么就向大队要，不必再搞食堂家底生产等等。结果，食堂油盐钱还得月月向大队要。这样，就影响了群众的生产积极性。
    从这件事情中，大队党总支认识到要想充分发挥群众的生产积极性，必须要安排好群众的生活；要安排好群众的生活，首先就要办好食堂；要办好食堂，建立家底生产就很重要。为了解决这个问题，大队党总支书记陈利庆深入到这个生产队以后，就通过总结食堂一年多来的经验和介绍先进食堂的事例，使大家认识了建立家底生产对办好食堂，促进生产的重要意义。
    接着，为了加强对这一工作的领导，大队党总支又派大队妇女副队长易居香到乐园食堂去，帮助把这个食堂的家底生产搞起来。乐园食堂又派作业组长欧利英和食堂管理员袁继华等五个人成立了食堂家底生产领导小组，并依靠积极分子发展食堂家底生产。很快，这个食堂由几只猪、鸡，发展到生猪三十头，鸡、鸭二百五十多只，鹅十只、家兔一百九十只、鸽子八十对。种了三十七亩多蔬菜、饲料和杂粮，放养了一千多尾鱼。
    在处理和解决食堂家底生产和大集体生产的劳力、土地、肥料使用方面，乐园食堂采取的措施是：在劳力方面，为了不占用主要劳力，他们把未评级的辅助劳力组成专业队。同时，利用社员出工前后的空闲时间搞食堂家底生产。在土地安排方面：除十二亩原有的老菜土种菜外，其他菜土、饲料地是利用屋场基地和空坪隙地来种植。最近又开荒十三亩，种上了黄豆和杂粮，没有占用正式耕地面积。在家肥方面也作了合理安排，规定大集体生产占80％，食堂家底生产占20％。随着家底生产的发展，猪、鸡、鸭粪多了，不仅食堂用不完，每月还给生产队四十到五十担优质肥，有力地促进了大生产的发展。
    食堂家底生产的发展，大大改善了社员生活，进一步办好了食堂。这个食堂今年已卖出五头肥猪、八十只鸡、鸭和一批家兔，又卖出三百二十多个蛋，一千多元的蔬菜。不仅解决了油盐钱，还添置了一套炊具，粉刷了房子，存储了四百多元。现在，社员每人每天可以吃上新鲜蔬菜三到四斤，还存储八千多斤干菜，并且经常能吃到小荤和蛋品、豆制品等副食品。
    由于生活得到了改善，社员劳动积极性空前高涨，全生产队四十八个劳力，天天满勤，其中达到“五好”社员标准的就有四十二个。最近又全力投入以田间管理和积肥为中心的生产运动，决心争取全年好收成。社员们为了歌颂这个好食堂、编了一首山歌：“乐园食堂，越办越强，建立家底，人兴财旺。种菜养猪，鸡鸭鱼蛋，有吃有售，还有储藏。生活改善，生产上涨，幸福日子，赛过‘天堂’。”
