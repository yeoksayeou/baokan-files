    Complete and Overfulfill Plans Daily, Every Ten Days, and Monthly
    Factories, mines, transportation, and construction enterprises across the country are mobilizing the masses to discuss and formulate production increase and thrift plans for the next four months. This is a crucial link in launching a mass movement for production increase and thrift, centered on grain and steel. Grasping this link effectively is of utmost importance for fully tapping the potential for production increase and thrift, fully mobilizing the enthusiasm of the masses, and completing and overfulfilling production increase and thrift plans on a daily, every ten days, and monthly basis. Those enterprises that acted earlier and fully mobilized the masses to discuss and formulate plans have already witnessed a new high tide of vigorous production. Every enterprise must seize the opportunity and do this work well.
    Production increase and thrift plans are the action program for the mass movement for production increase and thrift and the goal for the vast number of workers. When every worker understands the plan targets assigned to their enterprise by the state and has a goal to strive for in overfulfilling the state plan, it is easier to unleash the enthusiasm and creativity of the broad masses. The production increase and thrift plans discussed and formulated by mobilizing the masses must be proactive yet realistic, comprehensive, and specific. Proactive yet realistic means that when discussing and formulating production increase and thrift plan targets, both the objective possibility of material and technical conditions and the subjective initiative of people's revolutionary spirit must be fully considered; we must dare to think and act, muster our energy, and also conduct scientific analysis and careful calculations, leaving room for maneuver. Only the plan targets set in this way can be advanced and capable of being overfulfilled. Comprehensive means that not only should targets for increasing production be set, but also targets for improving quality, increasing variety, reducing raw material consumption, lowering costs, saving labor, and ensuring safe production. Such a plan is in line with the requirements of the general line for building socialism. Carrying out the production increase and thrift movement under the guidance of such a plan can achieve a comprehensive and continuous leap forward that is more, faster, better, more economical, and safer. Specific means that not only should there be a general plan for the enterprise, but each workshop, each section, each group, and even each individual must formulate their own plans based on the requirements of the general plan and their own specific conditions; not only should there be a general plan for the next four months, but also monthly, ten-day, daily, and shift plans. On the one hand, individual plans ensure group plans, group plans ensure section plans, section plans ensure workshop plans, and workshop plans ensure enterprise plans; on the other hand, shifts guarantee days, days guarantee ten-day periods, ten-day periods guarantee months, and months guarantee quarters. In this way, level by level implementation, grasping month by month, every ten days, day by day, and shift by shift, everyone musters their energy, strives to be upstream at all times, and problems are solved as soon as they are discovered, and advanced experiences and methods are promoted as soon as they are discovered, ensuring the overfulfillment of the enterprise's overall production increase and thrift plan. In this regard, the Daily Red Production Movement carried out by the Third Engineering Bureau of the Lanzhou Construction Engineering Department in Gansu Province has set a good example for us. Since November of last year, this engineering bureau has insisted on using days to guarantee ten-day periods, ten-day periods to guarantee months, months to guarantee quarters, and quarters to guarantee years, requiring each unit and grassroots production team (group) to overfulfill the plan from the first ten-day period of each month and the first day of each ten-day period, not only achieving continuous three hundred and five days of Daily Red Production, but also achieving a combination of work and rest, making overall progress in production, learning, and recreational activities. The experience of this engineering bureau in grasping tightly from the first month, the first ten-day period, and the first day is a good experience and worthy of serious study.
    How can we complete and overfulfill production increase and thrift plans on a daily, every ten days, and monthly basis? The key lies in having advanced measures as a guarantee. Measures are the specific methods for realizing the plan. If the plan is specific, the measures must be practical and specific; if the plan is comprehensive, the measures must also be comprehensive. Targets are only the goals to strive for, and how to achieve the goals depends on specific measures, including both spiritual and material aspects, not only doing a good job in political and ideological work so that everyone understands their responsibilities and the importance of fulfilling them, but also doing a good job in production preparations, such as equipment maintenance, spare parts preparation, production maintenance, and safety measures. The slogan "Ten parts target, twelve parts measures, twenty-four parts drive" applies not only to every enterprise, but also to every workshop, every section, every group, and every individual. Why should the measures be two parts more than the target? This is because we cannot calculate 100% of the problems that may arise in future production development when planning. If ten parts of the target are guaranteed by twelve parts of measures, then even if unexpected changes occur, even if one or two parts of the measures cannot be fulfilled, there are still ten parts of the measures to guarantee the ten parts of the target; if things develop exactly as expected and the twelve parts of measures are fully realized as scheduled, then the plan can be better overfulfilled. When mobilizing the masses to discuss and formulate production increase and thrift plans, we must simultaneously discuss and formulate specific measures to achieve the plan. Every link in production, no matter how big or small, must be specifically arranged, there must be sufficient measures to guarantee it, and there must be a dedicated person responsible for supervising and checking, so that completing and overfulfilling production increase and thrift plans on a daily, every ten days, and monthly basis has a reliable guarantee.
    In order to fully mobilize the masses and do a good job in discussing and formulating production increase and thrift plans, the leading comrades of enterprises must go to mines, workshops, stations, and docks, to the front line of production, tell the masses the specific requirements of the state for the enterprise, tell the masses the current excellent situation, and make everyone understand that the situation is very good, the conditions are also very good, and everyone is clear about the glorious task they shoulder. Then, lead the masses to discuss and formulate production increase and thrift plans and specific measures to achieve the plan for the next four months. Through mass discussions, promote advanced ideas; promote a down-to-earth style; promote the fine traditions of diligence and thrift. In short, we must transform the process of organizing the masses to discuss and formulate plans and measures into a process of further mobilizing the masses, into a process of further improving the masses' awareness, improving the masses' enthusiasm and creativity, into a process of further mustering energy and striving to be upstream, into a process of further improving leadership methods and leadership style, and into a process of further mobilizing the masses to overcome key production issues and carry out technical innovation and technical revolution movements. In this way, not only can we formulate a realistic production increase and thrift plan and a set of practical and feasible specific measures, but also create extremely favorable conditions for further carrying out labor competitions. It is foreseeable that through fully mobilizing the masses to discuss and formulate production increase and thrift plans, many advanced units with Daily Red, Ten-Day Red, and Monthly Red will inevitably emerge, pushing the production increase and thrift movement to a new high tide.

    按日、按旬、按月地完成和超额完成计划
    全国工厂矿山、交通运输和建筑企业，正在发动群众讨论和制定今后四个月的增产节约计划。这是开展以粮、钢为中心的增产节约群众运动的一个重要环节。这一环抓得好，对于充分挖掘增产节约潜力，充分调动群众积极性，按日、按旬、按月地完成和超额完成增产节约计划，有着极大的关系。那些行动得比较早，并且充分发动了群众讨论和制定了计划的企业，一个热气腾腾的生产新高潮已经出现。每一个企业都必须抓紧时机，把这个工作做好。
    增产节约计划是增产节约群众运动的行动纲领，是广大职工群众奋斗的目标。每个工人都了解了国家下达给本企业的计划指标，又有了超额完成国家计划的奋斗目标，就更易于发挥广大群众的积极性和创造性。发动群众讨论和制定的增产节约计划，必须是积极而又切合实际的、全面的、具体的。积极而又切合实际，就是说在讨论和制定增产节约计划指标的时候，既要充分考虑物质技术条件的客观可能性，又要充分估计人们革命干劲的主观能动性；既要敢想敢干，鼓足干劲，又要进行科学的分析，周密的计算，并且留有余地。这样订出的计划指标，才是先进的，同时又是能够超额完成的。全面，就是不仅要定出增加产量的指标，还要定出提高质量、增加品种、降低原料和材料消耗、降低成本、节约劳动力和安全生产的指标。这样的计划，才符合于建设社会主义总路线的要求。在这样的计划指导下开展增产节约运动，就能实现又多、又快、又好、又省、又安全的全面持续的跃进。具体，就是不仅有企业的总计划，而且每个车间、每个工段、每个小组，甚至每一个人，都要根据总计划的要求和自己的具体条件，制定自己的计划；不仅有今后四个月的总计划，还要有每月、每旬、每日、每班的计划。一方面以个人计划保证小组计划，以小组计划保证工段计划，以工段计划保证车间计划，以车间计划保证企业计划；另一方面，以班保日，以日保旬，以旬保月，以月保季。这样一级一级的落实，逐月、逐旬、逐日、逐班的抓，人人鼓足干劲，每时每刻力争上游，一发现问题就解决，一发现先进经验、先进方法就推广，超额完成企业总的增产节约计划就有切实的保证。在这一方面，甘肃省兰州的建筑工程部第三工程局开展的生产日日红运动，给我们树立了一个好的榜样。这个工程局从去年11月起到现在，由于坚持了以日保旬、以旬保月、以月保季、以季保年，要求每个单位和基层生产队（组），从每月的第一旬、每旬的第一天起，就超额完成计划，不但做到了连续三百零五天生产日日红，并且做到了劳逸结合，使生产、学习、文娱活动全面跃进。这个工程局从第一个月、第一旬、第一天起就抓紧的经验，是一个好经验，值得认真学习。
    怎样做到按日、按旬、按月地完成和超额完成增产节约计划呢？关键在于要有先进的措施做保证。措施，就是实现计划的具体办法。计划具体，措施必须落实、具体；计划全面，措施也要全面。指标只是奋斗的目标，而如何达到目标，就必须靠具体的措施，这里包括精神的和物质的两方面，既要把政治思想工作做好，让每个人了解自己的职责和克尽职责的重要性，又要把生产准备，例如设备的检修、备品、备件的准备，生产维护工作，安全措施等工作都做好。“十分指标，十二分措施，二十四分干劲”这个口号，不只适用于每个企业，也适用于每个车间、每个工段、每个小组和每个人。为什么措施要比指标多二分呢？这是因为我们对未来生产发展中可能出现的问题，不可能在计划的时候就百分之百地计算到。如果十分指标有十二分措施做保证，那么即使事情发生了预想不到的变化，即使有一、二分措施兑现不了，仍然有十分措施保证十分指标；如果事情完全按照预想的那样发展，十二分措施完全如期实现，那么就可以更好地超额完成计划。我们在发动群众讨论和制定增产节约计划的时候，必须同时讨论和制定实现计划的具体措施。对于生产上的每一个环节，无论巨细，都要具体安排，都要有足够的措施作保证，并且都要有专人负责督促和检查，这样按日按旬按月地完成和超额完成增产节约计划就有了可靠的保证。
    为了充分发动群众，做好讨论和制定增产节约计划的工作，企业的领导同志一定要到矿坑、车间、车站、码头上去，到生产第一线去，把国家对企业的具体要求告诉群众，把当前的大好形势告诉群众，让大家都明白形势好得很，条件也好得很，都清楚自己肩负的光荣任务。然后领导群众讨论和制定今后四个月的增产节约计划和实现计划的具体措施。通过群众性的讨论，发扬先进思想；发扬踏踏实实的作风；发扬勤俭、节约的优良传统。总之，我们要把组织群众讨论和制定计划和措施的过程，变为进一步发动群众的过程，变为进一步提高群众觉悟，提高群众的积极性和创造性的过程，变为进一步鼓干劲、争上游的过程，变为进一步改进领导方法和领导作风的过程，变为进一步动员群众攻克生产关键，开展技术革新、技术革命运动的过程。这样不但可以订出一个切合实际的增产节约计划和一套切实可行的具体措施来，而且可以为进一步开展劳动竞赛创造极有利的条件。可以预料，通过充分发动群众，讨论和制定增产节约计划，必然将出现许许多多日日红、旬旬红、月月红的先进单位，把增产节约运动推向新的高潮。
