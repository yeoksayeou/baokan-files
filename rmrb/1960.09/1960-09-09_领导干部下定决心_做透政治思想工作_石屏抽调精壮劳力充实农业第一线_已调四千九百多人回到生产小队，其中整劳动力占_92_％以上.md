Leading Cadres Resolve to Do Thorough Political and Ideological Work
    Shiping Draws Strong Labor Force to Enrich the Agricultural Frontline
    More Than 4,900 People Have Been Transferred Back to Production Teams, of Which Over 92% Are Full Labor Force
    According to the Yunnan Daily, Shiping County in Yunnan Province resolutely draws strong labor forces to invest in agricultural production. Now, 4,967 people, accounting for 10% of the original agricultural labor force, have been transferred from the county to the management area, and 4,913 people have returned to the production team to participate in production, of which 92.23% are full labor force.
    In mid-July, after the Shiping County Committee of the Communist Party of China further implemented the contracted production targets to the production teams, the broad masses of cadres and members were full of energy and continued to add production increase measures to strive for high yields in autumn. The county committee also paid attention to surveying the use of labor throughout the county and found that there were not many strong labor forces on the agricultural front line. The county committee was determined to concentrate strong labor forces from all aspects to the agricultural production front.
    In order to do this work well, the county committee decided to conduct a wide and in-depth publicity and education campaign with agriculture as the foundation, and to thoroughly carry out ideological work. The county successively convened six party and league member conferences and a large-scale national food production broadcasting conference, and used broadcasting, blackboards, big-character posters, and conference reports, small group discussions, and individual talks to vigorously promote the idea that agriculture is the foundation of the national economy and that grain is the foundation of the foundation. Combining the great situation in rural areas and the use of labor, the whole party and the whole people launched a heated discussion. The main topics of discussion were: Why should agriculture be the foundation? How to ensure the sustained leap forward in grain production? Through discussion, a sense of honor in agricultural labor was established among the masses, and the idea of vigorously developing agriculture and grain production was deeply rooted in the hearts of the people. Many young cadres and workers in organs and units, while discussing, posted big-character posters, applying to go to the agricultural front. Bai Xiaosan, a temporary worker at the County Agricultural Science Research Institute, happily said after the leadership approved his return to the countryside: "To build socialism, grain is the treasure of treasures. It is the most glorious thing for me to produce the treasure of treasures for socialism." City resident Lu Lishi applied to go to the agricultural front again and again. She insisted: "I have a share of heat, I want to give off a share of light, pulling a weed is also contributing to socialism."
    The county not only acted quickly in transferring labor, but also paid special attention to quality. Initially, some units were unwilling to concentrate strong labor on the agricultural front. After the Shiping County Committee discovered this problem, in addition to doing a good job in political and ideological work so that the idea of vigorously developing agriculture and grain production was deeply rooted in the hearts of the people, it also made specific regulations to ensure that more young adults were transferred. Because the county committee grasped this problem tightly and specifically, the quality of the labor concentrated on the agricultural front was relatively good. According to the survey, among the first batch of 630 laborers transferred from the Sanchahe Water Conservancy Project, 359 were men and 271 were women; young people accounted for 55%, adults accounted for 45%; party members accounted for 13%; cadres accounted for 9.3%. However, the county committee did not relax on the issue of concentrating labor and further organized inspections. Five county party secretaries took responsibility for different areas, and 23 county party committee members took charge of communes. They organized five inspection teams to go deep into communes, management areas, and production teams to conduct "three checks": checking whether the people who should be transferred were transferred enough, checking whether the transferred personnel met the quality standards, and checking whether the people transferred back were properly arranged. After the inspection, among the 4,967 people who had been transferred back, men accounted for 63.5%, women accounted for 36.5%; full labor force accounted for 92.23%, semi-labor force accounted for 6.32%, and attached labor force accounted for 1.45%, basically ensuring the quality of labor required by the agricultural front. The commune members reacted well to the transfer of strong labor to agricultural production, and some praised: The people who come back are worth three!
    In order to ensure that the transferred labor force returns to the production team and truly invests in agricultural production, the Shiping County Committee not only stipulated tasks and time, but also stipulated that it is not allowed to detain them at each level.
    Because the concentrated labor force is implemented in the production team, it has powerfully promoted the current production movement. Among the 155 management areas in the county, 25 management areas have concentrated their forces to carry out large-scale rush harvesting, and 118 management areas have started small-scale autumn harvests, achieving ripeness and harvest; the daily progress of expanding the planting of late autumn crops has increased from the original 1,740 mu to 3,725 mu; the number of people accumulating fertilizer for the small spring has increased from 3,200 before August 5 to 5,200, and the county has completed 38% of the fertilizer plan for the small spring.

    领导干部下定决心　做透政治思想工作
    石屏抽调精壮劳力充实农业第一线
    已调四千九百多人回到生产小队，其中整劳动力占92％以上
    据云南日报报道　云南石屏县坚决抽调精壮劳动力，投入农业生产。现在，从县到管理区所调出的占原来农业劳动力10％的四千九百六十七人，已有四千九百一十三人回到生产队，参加了生产，其中整劳动力占92.23％。
    7月中旬，中共石屏县委进一步把包产指标落实到生产队后，广大干部和社员鼓足干劲，继续增添增产措施，争取秋季高产多收。县委同时注意摸了全县劳动力使用情况，发现农业第一线强壮劳动力不多，县委就下决心从各方面集中精壮劳动力到农业生产战线上去。
    为了做好这一工作，县委决定广泛深入地进行一次以农业为基础的宣传教育，做透思想工作。全县先后召开了六次党团员大会和声势浩大的全民办粮食广播大会，并运用广播、黑板报、大字报和大会报告、小会讨论、个别谈话等形式，大张旗鼓地宣传农业是国民经济的基础，粮食是基础的基础的思想。结合讲农村大好形势和劳动力使用情况，全党全民展开了一场热烈的大讨论。讨论的题目主要有：为什么要以农业为基础？如何保证粮食生产持续跃进？经过讨论，在群众中树立了农业劳动光荣感，使大办农业、大办粮食的思想深入人心。许多机关、单位的青年干部、工人，一面讨论，一面张贴大字报，申请到农业战线上去。县农业科学研究所的临时工人白小三在领导批准回农村后，高兴地说：“要建设社会主义，粮食是宝中宝，我能为社会主义生产宝中之宝，是最光荣的事情。”城市居民陆李氏三番五次申请到农业战线去，她坚持说：“我有一分热，要发一分光，拔棵草也是为社会主义出力。”
    这个县抽调劳力不仅行动快，而且特别注意质量。最初，有的单位不愿把强壮劳动力集中到农业战线上去。石屏县委发现了这个问题后，除做好政治思想工作，使大办农业大办粮食的思想深入人心外，并做了一定要多调青壮年的具体规定。由于县委对这个问题抓得紧，抓得具体，集中到农业战线的劳力的质量都比较好。据调查，三岔河水利工地第一批调出的六百三十个劳动力中，男的有三百五十九人，女的有二百七十一人；青年占55％，壮年占45％；党团员占13％；干部占9.3％。但是，县委对集中劳力问题并不放松，进一步又组织检查。五个县委书记分片包干，二十三个县委委员分工包公社，组织了五个检查小组，深入公社、管理区、生产队进行“三查”：查应调的人是否调够，查已调人员是否适合质量标准，查调回的人是否作了妥善安排。经过检查，在已经调回的四千九百六十七人中，男的占63.5％，女的占36.5％；整劳动力占92.23％，半劳力占6.32％，附带劳动力占1.45％，基本上保证了农业战线所需劳力的质量。社员们对调强壮劳动力投入农业生产反映很好，有的称赞说：回来的人可以一顶三！
    为了保证调出的劳动力回到生产队，真正投入农业生产，石屏县委除了规定任务、时间外，还规定不准层层扣留。
    由于集中的劳动力一竿子落实到生产队，有力地推动了当前生产运动。全县一百五十五个管理区中，有二十五个管理区已经集中力量大面积地突击抢收，一百一十八个管理区开始了小面积秋收，做到熟一块收一块；扩种晚秋作物的日进度，由原来的一千七百四十亩，增加到三千七百二十五亩；小春的积肥人数由8月5日前的三千二百人，增加到五千二百人，全县积肥已完成小春用肥计划的38％。（附图片）
