Xinhua News Agency, Bonn, September 20th: The North Atlantic military bloc began a large-scale provocative military exercise in Schleswig-Holstein, West Germany, today. This is the largest land and naval joint exercise held by the bloc in West Germany.

The "West German Armed Forces Communications" reported that this autumn exercise, named "Hold Fast," surpasses the "Winter Shield" exercise held in Bavaria, West Germany, in February of this year in terms of "spatial scope, number of participants, and significance."

According to the West German "Die Welt," the West German Sixth Tank Infantry Division, the Danish Third Division, and the British Fourth Division, totaling 50,000 soldiers, 12,000 tanks and various vehicles, as well as numerous naval and air force squadrons, are participating in this autumn exercise. The commander of this exercise is the Commander of the North Atlantic Northern Europe Command, British General Murray.

"Die Welt" said that the purpose of the North Atlantic bloc in holding this exercise is to test the military "defense" forces in the northern German region that are "particularly threatened" in "dangerous situations." However, this so-called "defensive" exercise includes combat items such as parachuting and landing.

It is reported that the West German border guard coastal defense command will also send troops to participate in this exercise. In addition to participating in the exercise, they will also take so-called "supervisory measures to ensure the coastal defense zone" to prevent possible "border violations" along the area bordering the German Democratic Republic.

In preparation for this provocative military exercise, the relevant command of the North Atlantic bloc began moving troops to the exercise site last weekend. During the troop movements, there were many traffic accidents, injuring many people, and one British soldier was burned to death due to a tool vehicle fire.

　　西德边防军部队将在德意志民主共和国边境进行挑衅活动
    新华社波恩20日电　北大西洋军事集团从今天开始在西德的石勒苏益格—荷尔斯泰因州举行一次大规模挑衅性军事演习，这是这个集团在西德举行的规模最大的一次陆、海军联合演习。
    “西德国防军通讯”报道说，这次名为“抓紧”的秋季演习在“空间范围、参加人数及其意义”等各方面都超过了今年2月间在西德巴伐利亚州举行的“冬季盾牌”演习。
    据西德“世界报”报道，参加这次秋季演习的有西德第六坦克步兵师、丹麦第三师、英国第四师共五万名士兵，一万二千辆坦克和各种车辆及许多海军和空军飞行队。这次演习的指挥官是北大西洋北欧司令部司令、英国将军墨莱。
      “世界报”说，北大西洋集团举行这次演习的目的是试验一下在“危险情况下”，“特别受到威胁”的德国北部地区的军事“防御”力量。但是，这次所谓“防御”性演习中却包括空降和登陆等作战项目。
    据报道，西德的边防军海岸边防指挥部也将派出部队参加这次演习。它们除参加演习外，还要沿着与德意志民主共和国交界的地区采取所谓“保障海岸防御地带”防止可能的“侵犯边界的监督措施”。
    为了准备这次挑衅性军事演习，北大西洋集团有关指挥部从上周末即开始把军队调往演习地点。军队在调动途中，发生了多起交通事故，伤了许多人，有一个英国士兵因工具车失火被烧死。
