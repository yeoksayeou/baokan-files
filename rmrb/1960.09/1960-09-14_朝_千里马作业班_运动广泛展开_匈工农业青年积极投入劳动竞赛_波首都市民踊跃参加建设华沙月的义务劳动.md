Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, – The Korean "Chollima Workteam" movement is being further widely unfolded.

The Kangson Steel Works, which first initiated this movement, already has nine workteams that have received the title of "Chollima Workteam." The factory's employees recently held a meeting, resolving to have all employees participate in this movement within two years. Kim Bo-kwon, director of the small steel rolling workshop of the factory, proposed at the meeting to create a "Chollima Workshop." Kim Bo-kwon said that by the end of next year, their workshop would realize eight innovations such as the automation of rolling tools, so that the output of steel next year would be doubled compared to this year.

The employees of the Aoji Coal Mine, one of the largest anthracite mines in Korea, recently held a meeting to further develop the "Chollima Workteam" movement. Labor hero Li Chenghuan introduced at the meeting his experience in leading the "Chollima Workteam" to increase coal production from 5,000 tons to 10,000 tons per month in one working face. He said that in order to develop the monthly coal production of one working face from 10,000 tons to 15,000 tons, it is necessary to strengthen the communist education of each workteam member in the future. The nine workteams of this coal mine participating in the "Chollima Workteam" movement have all reached or exceeded the level of 10,000 tons of coal per month.

The faculty and staff of Kim Il-sung University have also recently launched a movement to create Chollima majors. Li Hyo-jun, a teacher of radio semiconductor major at the university, said at a meeting that through this movement, they would learn the noble qualities of the working class, make themselves red fighters of the Party, and train students to become strong builders of communism. The faculty and staff of the organic chemistry major also expressed their determination to implement the Party's slogan of "One for all, all for one" into every faculty member. They also stated that they would strengthen joint research work, further approach production units, and combine teaching with the development of Korea's organic chemical industry.

In addition, the faculty and staff of Kim Chaek University of Technology and other universities and the medical staff of the Pyongyang Xiqu Health and Epidemic Prevention Station have also held meetings in recent days to launch this movement.

Xinhua News Agency, Budapest, – Youths on the industrial and agricultural fronts in Hungary continue to widely launch labor emulations.

Up to now, in industrial and mining enterprises across the country, there are 1,600 "Youth Export Product Production Teams" and more than 1,500 "Socialist Youth Labor Teams" participating in the labor emulation to greet the Communist Youth League Congress to be held at the end of this year. Young workers in more than 500 factories and mines across the country have put forward specific gift tasks.

The young employees of the open-hearth furnace workshop of the Chepel Steel Plant guarantee to overproduce 2,600 tons of steel. The young people of the Balfaru Mining Machinery Plant promised to complete the order for the Donau Cement and Lime Plant one year ahead of schedule in order to accelerate the construction of the factory. The Communist Youth League members of the Lenin Steel Plant decided to save raw materials worth 30 million forints (Hungarian currency). The young steelworkers of this factory proposed to increase labor productivity by another 12.7% by the end of the year, exceeding the plan. The young steel rolling workers guaranteed to increase the production of rolled steel worth 1.5 million forints. All the young employees of the factory also proposed to carry out 10,000 hours of voluntary labor for the nearby agricultural production cooperative.

The "Youth Construction Teams" in various places also proposed to build more than 100 cowsheds for agricultural production cooperatives by the end of the year with amateur voluntary labor.

Rural youths have widely launched labor emulations of "producing 30 quintals of corn per holt (equivalent to 8.55 mu)" and "producing 250 quintals of feed per holt." At present, 931 corn production teams across the country have guaranteed to achieve a yield of 30 quintals per holt on 29,000 holt of land planted with corn.

More than 4,000 young people participating in the "Young Tractor Driver" competition have increased the harvesting volume of each combine harvester from more than 100 holt last year to 225 holt. Harvesting expert and Communist Youth League member Kovacs Lajos created a new harvesting record. During the summer harvest, he used a combine harvester to harvest 100 train carriages of grain.

Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, – Warsaw citizens actively participate in voluntary labor to build Warsaw. According to the "Warsaw Life Daily" report: 100,000 residents will participate in voluntary labor in September.

September is the traditional Construction Warsaw Month after World War II. During this month, a large number of citizens participate in voluntary labor in the construction of Warsaw and donate and raise construction funds to restore and build the Polish capital, which was destroyed by the war.

This year's construction scale in Warsaw is very large. There are currently 4,000 construction projects in the city, with a construction area of approximately 20 million square meters. Residents of many districts have actively participated in voluntary labor to improve the city's appearance for a long time. For example, in the workers' residential area of Will District alone, 18,000 people participated in the labor to improve the city's appearance in July, saving the country more than 100,000 zlotys (Polish currency). In September, residents of various districts will more enthusiastically participate in the work of building the capital. Now, residents of Ochota District and other districts have taken the lead in taking active action. Red banners with the slogan "September - Construction Warsaw Month" are hung on the streets of the city.

    新华社平壤电　朝鲜“千里马作业班”运动正进一步广泛地展开。
    首先发起这一运动的降仙炼钢厂目前已经有九个作业班获得了“千里马作业班”的称号。这个厂的职工最近举行了集会，决心要在二年内使全厂职工都参加这个运动。这个厂的小型钢材压延车间的车间主任金保权在会上提出要创造“千里马车间”。金保权说，到明年年底以前他们的车间要实现压延工具自动化等八项革新，使明年钢材的产量比今年增加一倍。
    朝鲜最大的烟煤矿之一——阿吾地煤矿的职工，最近也为进一步发展“千里马作业班”运动举行集会。劳动英雄李承焕在会上介绍了他领导的“千里马作业班”在一个掌子面由每月采煤五千吨提高到一万吨的经验。他表示为了把一个掌子面月采煤万吨发展到一万五千吨，今后更要加强对每个作业班成员的共产主义教育。这个煤矿参加“千里马作业班”运动的九个作业班都达到或超过了月采煤万吨的水平。
    金日成综合大学的教职员们，最近也展开了创造千里马专业的运动。这所大学的无线电半导体专业的教员李孝俊在一次集会上表示，要通过这一运动，学习工人阶级的高贵品质，使自己成为党的红色战士，并把学生培养成为坚强的共产主义建设者。有机化学专业的教职员并表示决心要把“我为人人，人人为我”的党的口号贯彻到每个教职员中去。他们还表示要加强共同研究工作，进一步接近生产单位，把教学工作和朝鲜的有机化学工业的发展结合起来。
    另外，金策工业大学等高等学校和平壤市西区卫生防预所的医务人员连日来也纷纷集会，展开了这一运动。
    新华社布达佩斯电　匈牙利工农业战线上的青年继续广泛地展开劳动竞赛。
    到现在为止，全国工矿企业中单是参加迎接将在今年年底召开的共产主义青年团代表大会的劳动竞赛的，就有一千六百个“青年出口产品生产队”和一千五百多个“社会主义青年劳动队”，全国已有五百多个厂矿的青年工人提出了具体的献礼任务。
    切佩尔钢铁厂平炉车间的青年职工保证要超计划生产二千六百吨钢。巴尔法鲁采矿机器厂的青年为加速多瑙水泥和石灰厂的建设，保证提前一年完成这个工厂的订货。列宁钢铁厂的共青团员们决定节约价值三千万福林（匈币）的原料。这个厂的青年炼钢工人提出，到年底要超过计划把劳动生产率再提高12.7％，青年轧钢工人保证要增产价值一百五十万福林的轧钢材。全厂青年职工还提出要为附近的农业生产合作社进行一万小时的义务劳动。
    各地的“青年建筑队”也提出，到年底为止要用业余的义务劳动为农业生产合作社修建一百多个牛棚。
    农村青年广泛展开了“每一霍尔特（合八点五五市亩）生产三十公担玉蜀黍”、“每一霍尔特生产二百五十公担饲料”的劳动竞赛。现在，全国已有九百三十一个玉蜀黍生产队提出保证，要在种植玉蜀黍的二万九千霍尔特土地上使每一霍尔特的收成达到三十公担。
    参加“青年拖拉机手”竞赛的四千多名青年，把每台收获联合机的收割量从去年的一百多霍尔特提高到二百二十五霍尔特。收割能手、共青团员科瓦奇·拉约什创造了新的收割纪录，他在夏收期间用一台收获联合机收割了一百车皮粮食。
    新华社华沙电　华沙市民积极参加建设华沙的义务劳动。据“华沙生活报”报道：9月份参加义务劳动的将有十万个居民。
    9月是第二次世界大战后传统的建设华沙月。在这个月里，大批市民参加建设华沙的义务劳动和捐献、募集建设基金的活动，以恢复和建设遭受战争破坏的波兰首都。
    今年华沙的建设规模十分巨大，全市目前有四千个建筑项目，建筑面积约达两千万平方米。许多区的居民很早以来就积极参加建设城市的义务劳动。例如，工人聚居的意志区仅在7月份内就有一万八千人参加了改善市容的劳动，为国家节约十万多兹罗提（波币）。在9月份内，各区居民将更加踊跃参加建设首都的工作。现在，奥乔塔区和其它区的居民已经带头积极行动起来。市内街道上都挂起了“九月——建设华沙月”的红色横幅标语。
