This is Qingbi Village on the bank of the Luo River, where the Shaanxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Youth League and the Dali County Committee are holding an on-site meeting.

The person giving the report is not tall, and appears to be only about twenty years old, wearing a blue striped homespun shirt, often raising both hands to his chest, making various metaphors.

He turned around and wrote on the blackboard:

	Part Three – Bacterial Fertilizer

"Comrades, plant growth requires three elements, namely nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium... There is a lot of nitrogen in the air, but this nitrogen cannot be directly absorbed by plants... There is a kind of bacteria called 'nitrogen-fixing bacteria,' which is a small factory..."

There were two or three hundred people sitting and listening, not a sound, hundreds of pens danced on hundreds of notebooks, making a rustling sound.

Who is he? Is he a university professor? Is he a chemical expert? No. He is just a young farmer who has only attended elementary school for half a year, named He Wenyi.

It is he, a young man who two years ago could not even recognize a chemical symbol, who, under the encouragement of the three red banners of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Communes, worked hard and fiercely, attacking the scientific fortress, manufacturing and inventing 117 kinds of chemical fertilizers, bacterial fertilizers, pesticides, and other chemical crafts – a pair of brave hands tore open the mysterious veil of chemical technology and bacterial manufacturing.

The factory he leads has changed its name three times in the past two years: it was first called the "Indigenous Fertilizer Factory," then the "Bacterial Fertilizer Factory," and now the "Dali County Duanjia Commune Communist Youth League Chemical Factory." Their products are displayed in a hall:

Here is potassium nitrate, ammonia, plant growth stimulants, ammonium sulfate, indigenous urea...

Here are nitrogen-fixing bacteria, phosphorus bacteria, potassium bacteria, aureomycin, terreomycin...

Here are indigenous Ceresan, benzenesulfonyl diazide, 1605, 1059, cattle ringworm lotion, pertussis powder...

The commune members affectionately call them the "All-Purpose Chemical Factory" – whatever is needed for production, they supply.

They adhere to the policy of serving agriculture. In the past two years, they have produced 1.9 million jin of various chemical fertilizers and bacterial fertilizers (enough for the entire commune to apply 24 jin per mu), 60,000 jin of pesticides, and many other products. It can be said that every ear of wheat swaying in the wind and every blooming cotton flower on the Duanjia Plain has received nourishment from this small chemical factory!

They adhere to the policy of "running the factory diligently and thriftily, replacing foreign methods with indigenous ones." Walking through their workshop, the only equipment that can be called "modern" are a few thermometers, a newly added autoclave, and a soil rapid testing kit. The steaming baskets, water jars, cooking pots, and glass bottles collected from various places have played a magical role in the hands of this group of fearless young people.

“My future is here!”

In the beginning, there were only three of them – He Wenyi, He Yousheng, and He Jiazhe – who set up three iron pots under the opera stage and started to boil granular fertilizer and indigenous urea.

He Jiazhe, who came from a well-to-do middle peasant family, didn't want to do it as soon as he started, saying that he had a bad appetite and felt nauseous when he smelled the foul odor – this was a large open space, with not even a tree nearby, the sun of the dog days beating down on them, the smell of mixing manure, steaming bones, and boiling urine made people dizzy, so it was certainly not a comfortable thing.

He Wenyi said, "Okay, your stomach is not good, you can sift the soil!" He Jiazhe had attended junior high school for a few days, felt that he had some culture, and sighed while shaking the sieve: "What future is there in this!"

He Wenyi, however, picked the most difficult and dirtiest things to do himself. Every morning, he went door to door to empty chamber pots and clean latrines, searching for dead cats, rotten rats, and various bones as if looking for gold.

When he walked through the village carrying a manure basket, some women would cover their noses from afar, chirping and shouting: "Wenyi, you've stunk out the whole village!" Wenyi said with a smile:
"What's there to be afraid of! Can you eat something fragrant without something stinky?" Some people speculated behind his back, "Wenyi must have made a mistake, otherwise, why would he, as the secretary of the Youth League branch, be carrying manure all day long?"

Back home, his wife also disliked him for being dirty, not allowing him to enter the house, not eating at the same table with him, not washing his clothes, saying, "Look at you, doing these things as the secretary of the Youth League branch?"

	"This is a glorious task given by the Party!"

"Glorious? No one will wash your clothes!"

	"If no one washes them, I'll wash them myself, there is no sesame stalk that can't be broken open!" Wenyi smiled, picked up the sweat-stained shirt covered with dirt, stepped out the door, picked up the manure basket and left.

Soon, there was a second quarrel.

At that time, the factory had increased to eighteen people, and the township Party committee required them to rush to produce 300,000 jin of indigenous fertilizer in ten days in order to topdress the autumn fields. Coincidentally, several factories in the province came to recruit apprentices, and there was a fluctuation next to the fertilizer boiling pot. He Jiazhe and others abandoned this "no future" place to take the exam for a large factory.

He Wenyi was so anxious that his heart was fried, but his wife advised him: "Wenyi, look, everyone else is taking the exam for a big factory, why are you so stupid? You are a League member and have good political conditions, you should think about your future!"

He Wenyi said, "My future is here!"

His wife asked angrily, "Giving up a big factory and carrying manure all day long, is this your future?"

He Wenyi also got angry, pointed to the door, and shouted decisively: "I want to run this factory to the end, I won't go anywhere if the Party's task is not completed!"

Searching high and low for bones

With the help of the Party branch, a debate was launched: "Does the Indigenous Fertilizer Factory have a future?" After the issue was debated clearly and everyone's thinking was raised, they all settled down and mustered up their energy. No one disliked being dirty or afraid of the smell, and no one secretly slipped back to the team anymore. The young men fought day and night in shifts. The three smoke holes kept billowing thick smoke, and products poured into the field like small mountains.

"There are not enough bones!" 300,000 jin of indigenous fertilizer required 30,000 jin of bones, where could so many be found? The people sent out traveled all over the nearby villages, searched deep ditches and steep slopes, and brought back fewer and fewer bones each day.

One day, He Wenyi returned from a meeting in the township and saw a basket placed by the ditch, with half a rope tied to it. He looked forward and "Oh no!" Xu Genmao was hanging on a half cliff, not knowing what he was doing. "Genmao, are you risking your life? Is this three or four zhang high cliff a joke?" He Wenyi shouted anxiously. But Xu Genmao shouted happily, "Look what this is!" It turned out that he was holding a cow leg bone in each hand.

A look of surprise shot out of He Wenyi's eyes: "Bones! Are there any more? How many?"

"There are many, I don't know if it's an ancient well cellar or a tomb? It's on this half cliff, there are more inside!"

He Wenyi couldn't bother to ask any more questions. He immediately tied the rope around his waist and said, "Genmao, you hold on, slowly lower me down!"

Xu Genmao said, "No, didn't you say it's dangerous?"

	"Don't say any more, pull the rope tight!"

He Wenyi slipped to the half cliff with a hoe. He dug a foothold on the cliff. After a careful look, there were indeed many bones buried in the soil. He forgot about the danger and shouted happily: "Genmao, hurry back and call people, a treasure trove has been discovered!"

From this cellar alone, they dug out more than 6,000 jin of cattle and horse bones.

He Wenyi thought, "Could there be such places?" He returned to the village to ask the elderly for advice. An old man named Lei said: "There was a cattle plague during the Guangxu years, and many dead cattle were thrown into a abandoned well in the village!"

This group of young people ran off shouting and found the long-buried earthen well. Digging down more than a zhang, a stench rushed up. The deeper they dug, the stronger the smell became. The oil lamp went out when it was lowered, and people couldn't stand it inside.

He Wenyi went to ask the old man named Lei again. The old man said: "The well has been buried for many years, and those stenches can't escape! You do this..." The old man told He Wenyi to find a basket, tie a rope to it, and swing it up and down in the well. "This way the yin qi will circulate!"

They did it according to this method, and it worked. The lamp could be lit, and people could go down. Under this well, they dug out more than 3,000 jin of bones.

At this time, the township Party committee issued a call, launching a "support the fertilizer factory" movement throughout the township. Each village and team came to send them bones. Students from vocational schools and elementary schools carried nitrate soil from the deep ditches for them, and the Party committee secretary's bicycle often carried a few bones on the back...

With the enthusiastic support of the masses, they produced 330,000 jin of indigenous fertilizer in ten days.

“Go back, send someone else!”

He Wenyi followed the county-organized visiting group to Xi'an, Taiyuan, Shijiazhuang and other places for a visit. He saw with his own eyes that the motherland during the Great Leap Forward was a scene of surging enthusiasm everywhere, especially under the encouragement of the Party's General Line, thousands upon thousands of young people like himself were boldly attacking science and creating miracles with their own hands, which greatly inspired him.

After He Wenyi returned from his study tour, he began to manufacture "self-generating nitrogen-fixing bacteria" using the "brick surface culture" method. However, this was an indigenous method, with low output and poor quality. Hearing that Dali Agricultural School was producing bacterial fertilizer using "foreign methods," He Wenyi immediately rode his bicycle to go there.

"Oh, welcome, welcome!" Teacher Wang, who was in charge of guiding the bacterial fertilizer factory, said this, but kept sizing up this rustic young man. "Learning to make bacteria requires several conditions, one is high school level, the minimum is junior high school graduation..." When he heard that He Wenyi had only attended elementary school for half a year, he repeatedly shook his head and said: "Go back, send someone else. Making bacteria is not simple, it is dangerous if it is not done well!"

He Wenyi asked for a brief introduction, but Teacher Wang said impatiently: "Let me ask you, do you have a concept of bacteria?" He drew a string of chemical symbols on the paper. "Can you understand these?"

He Wenyi was stunned there blankly, he really couldn't understand. Teacher Wang turned around and went to class.

	"Can't go back. Making bacterial fertilizer is a task given by the Party!" He Wenyi brushed the dust off his body and squatted down at the classroom door.

Teacher Wang was surprised to see He Wenyi still standing at the classroom door after class.

	"Teacher Wang, can you let me take a look inside?" He Wenyi pointed to the door of the bacteria making room and said.

"Hey!" Teacher Wang frowned and said: "You can't just go in there, I'm afraid you'll bring in stray bacteria. There's an electric incubator, a refrigerator, an autoclave, and ultraviolet lights for sterilization... This set of equipment alone costs more than 10,000 yuan, and it's currently out of stock, you can't buy it even if you have money!"

	"Are there any indigenous methods to replace them?"

	"We haven't studied that yet!"

He Wenyi grabbed Teacher Wang's clothes and said anxiously: "Can you please open the curtains and let me take a look from the outside?"

	"No, bacteria are afraid of sunlight!"

Teacher Wang refused this request and left. He Wenyi stood there alone, facing the small bacteria making room, looking at the tightly covered curtains, his teeth gnashing: "Bacteria, bacteria! Are you so mysterious? Are you so difficult? Teacher Wang, Teacher Wang! Won't you open the door even a crack?"

Piercing the Mystery of Bacteria

Back at the commune Party committee, He Wenyi found Secretary Yun and reported what had happened.

"People say that at least a junior high school level is required..." Secretary Yun poured a cup of water for this sweating young man and said: "There is a Wang Baojing, do you know him?"

"How could I not know Wang Baojing, we even attended a meeting together!"

"How educated is Wang Baojing?"

	"That's right, I'm going again!" He Wenyi pushed away the teacup and stood up. "There's no sesame stalk that can't be broken open!"

"Wait a minute!" Secretary Yun stopped him. "The Party committee will write you a letter..."

The next day, He Wenyi, with the letter, came to the Dali Agricultural School Party Committee Office with three other young people.

The Party Committee official warmly received them, and personally took them to Teacher Wang, saying: "You must be responsible for teaching them, and teach them whatever they want to learn!"

Teacher Wang saw that He Wenyi had come again. He was moved by the young man's tenacity.

They stayed at the school for three days, and they learned everything from inoculation to solid culture, liquid culture, sterilization, and bacterial liquid mixing. He Wenyi said happily in his heart: "This is not too difficult!" While learning, he considered the issue of "replacing foreign methods with indigenous ones."

	"We don't have an incubator when we go back, can we use something else to replace it?" He Wenyi asked a classmate surnamed Li for advice.

"It doesn't matter, a heated kang can also work, as long as you can maintain a temperature of 25 to 30 degrees!"

"We don't have such a sterile room either!" Meng Ruyue, the female deputy director who came with He Wenyi, said worriedly.

He Wenyi said: "Let's find a room, paste it well, and then fumigate it with 666 and sulfur, I don't know if it will work?"

	"It will work!" The classmate surnamed Li said. "As long as you can eliminate stray bacteria and maintain the temperature, nitrogen-fixing bacteria culture is not too difficult. If you have any questions, you can come to us at any time!"

They returned to Qingbi Village. Just as they had written to the Beijing Bacterial Fertilizer Factory and the Suzhou Bacterial Fertilizer Factory for materials, they had all been sent, which further increased their confidence. "Look, people thousands of miles away are reaching out to support us!"

More than ten days later, He Wenyi came to Dali Agricultural School again, holding a glass tube in his hand, smiling and saying:

"Teacher Wang, we bought some bacterial strains from Xi'an, please test them to see if they are okay?"

Teacher Wang took it in his hand, looked at it, observed it under a microscope for a long time, and did a strong force test, nodding and saying: "The bacterial seedlings are very good!"

He Wenyi couldn't help but smile and asked: "How does it compare to what the school produces?"

	"Almost, the quality is not bad!"

"Thank you, Teacher Wang!" He Wenyi laughed as soon as he went out.

Not long after, the County Science Popularization Association called:

"Hello, is this Teacher Wang? The nitrogen-fixing bacteria that He Wenyi and the others have cultivated... have you tested it?..."

"What? They cultivated it?" Teacher Wang asked in surprise.

He Wenyi's voice came from the transmitter: "Teacher Wang, I'm really sorry, please don't be angry..."

Teacher Wang felt ashamed, happy, and surprised at this time. After class, he rode his bicycle towards Qingbi Village.

At that time, He Wenyi and the others were an "underground factory" – because there was no place, they cleaned up several underground ruined kilns where people stored chaff, and they also dug a few small kilns halfway up the cliff – Teacher Wang searched for a long time before finding it. He pushed aside the thorns and weeds, and went down to the "workshop." A group of young people were all in the misty steam; some were steaming bottles, some were inoculating, some were mixing bacteria, chatting and laughing, very lively.

He Wenyi led Teacher Wang to visit each "workshop" and also showed him the first batch of finished products they had made.

The young people's enthusiasm and creative spirit deeply moved this teacher: their incubator was a vertical cabinet, with a kerosene lamp lit inside, and wrapped with two layers of cotton quilt outside. Their sterilizer was a steaming basket, potato water replaced agar liquid, a cold kiln replaced a refrigerator. There was no platinum inoculation loop, but an iron wire circle tied to a bamboo chopstick; there was no inoculation tube, but glucose syringes obtained from the health center...

Teacher Wang secretly nodded in admiration: "Truly, the sea cannot be measured!" He agreed to stay and help them solve some problems in operation.

Batches of bacterial fertilizer were constantly transported out of this "underground factory." In 1958, 40,000 mu of wheat in Duanjia Commune were applied with the nitrogen-fixing bacteria they manufactured.

"Hu Chengjing" turned into a "treasure chest"

	"Science" is like a high mountain, lying across He Wenyi's path forward. Because he didn't recognize chemical symbols, once they sent some water to Xi'an for testing, but no one could understand the returned test report, so they had to run dozens of miles to the city to ask someone to look at it. Because they didn't know that potassium nitrate was native saltpeter, calcium sulfate was gypsum, ferrous sulfate was green vitriol... sometimes they had this raw material on hand, but they still had to send someone out to buy it. As for not understanding chemical formulas and molecular weights, and not knowing how to calculate, it added countless difficulties to the work... He Wenyi still keeps an old notebook with him, filled with circles, ××'s, dashes and various "symbols" he himself "created". Sometimes he would write down some formula lists, but he himself couldn't understand them when he brought them back.

	"There is no sesame stalk that can't be broken open!" He Wenyi liked to say this sentence. He used this spirit to split open difficulties, seize knowledge, study and create, and move forward bravely.

This young man, who usually wouldn't waste a penny, the one who wouldn't even buy a bowl of cold noodles when he went to the city, became a regular customer of the Xinhua Bookstore. He devoured books on chemistry, physics, fertilizer lectures, arithmetic, Chinese medicine, veterinary manuals... His arms and the backs of his hands were often covered with various symbols and unfamiliar words.

He learned something, and immediately experimented and applied it. "Learn and use immediately" was a major feature of his learning.

Sometimes, in order to study something, he would move his luggage to the damp kiln and stay inside for ten days and a half months. Sometimes, he would take a few steamed buns and run around in the wild all day, sometimes down to the bottom of the ditch, sometimes up the hillside, carefully observing various soils and wild plants. Sometimes, he would think so hard that he would walk down the road with his eyes staring blankly, and he wouldn't hear others greeting him. Sometimes, he would read books and take notes all night long. If he fell asleep, he would lie down on the small table and take a nap. The hair on his forehead was curled up by the fire, and his comrades joked and called him "permed head," but he himself didn't know.

At first, some people couldn't get used to these actions and called him "Hu Chengjing" or "extracting oil." However, later facts silenced their mouths. He Wenyi's inventions and creations had clear effects one after another. The commune members affectionately called him a "treasure chest." They looked for him when the fields needed fertilizer, when the crops had pests, when the cattle had ringworm, and even when the young children were sick.

When the farm work was busy, the cattle had ringworm, which was very contagious, and some cattle quickly became weak and thin. The keepers came to He Wenyi, and he created a "cattle ringworm lotion." This lotion had a very good effect. Not only could it cure ringworm, but it could also make the hair grow back in the places where it had fallen out. More than 400 cattle with ringworm in the entire commune were cured with this lotion.

Wheat stripe rust was serious, and the production team leader said worriedly:

"Wenyi, do you have any way?" "Okay, I'll study it!" Later, a drug named "benzenesulfonyl diazide" was created. When this drug was sprinkled on the wheat fields, it could kill the germs on the one hand, and also act as a topdressing on the other hand.

When the children in the village suffered from pertussis, He Wenyi remembered that a book said that chicken gall could treat pertussis. He got some chicken gall and processed it in various ways, and finally extracted a medicine. "Is it really effective?" It just so happened that he himself was also suffering from a cough, so he dug out a spoonful and ate it. This was terrible. He had diarrhea and vomiting, as if he had been poisoned. This was in the middle of the night, and there was no one around. The next morning, people found him lying stiffly at the entrance of the kiln.

Everyone carried him home, and the Party branch secretary came with the doctor as soon as he heard the news. As soon as He Wenyi opened his eyes, he said: "Send someone...take the medicine...to the hospital..."

After rescue, He Wenyi was out of danger. The hospital wrote a letter saying: "Chicken gall extract" is effective for pertussis and can be used on a trial basis. As for the "poisoning" situation, it was because he ate too much... He Wenyi read this letter while lying on the kang, with a smile on his face.

The twelve children in the village who suffered from pertussis were all cured with this medicine. The news spread, and people from dozens of miles away came to look for the medicine. People even knocked on the door of the "chemical factory" in the middle of the night!

In the past two years, He Wenyi has been poisoned, fainted, and fallen ill more than once during the research and experimentation process. However, he was afraid that everyone would worry about him, so he always tried to hide it. The commune Party committee secretary and the brigade Party branch secretary would say to him when they met: "Wenyi, you don't look good, are you sick again? Be careful of your health!" Wenyi would just smile and say: "It's nothing, I'm fine!" He secretly said in his heart: "Doing scientific research is like fighting a war, how can you not be touched at all! Many great scientists have sacrificed their lives for their careers. I, a Communist Youth League member who grew up in the arms of the Party, would be most honored to be a scientific Huang Jiguang and Qiu Shaoyun!"

Continuing to move forward, riding the wind and waves

One night in the spring of 1960, it was late, but He Wenyi was still busy under the kerosene lamp, in the midst of that pile of bottles and cans.

He didn't know that at this time, in the conference room of the CPC Dali County Committee dozens of miles away, he was being discussed. The county Party committee secretary and county Party committee members, who had been meeting all day, were carefully listening to Secretary He Guoqiang's report on He Wenyi and the chemical factory he led. People nodded and exchanged brief opinions. This was the Party's command headquarters, the command post. The Party's wise eyes were always paying attention to every new thing and new seedling that appeared on the horizon. The County Committee pointed out that He Wenyi's spirit of hard work, bold creation, and the entrepreneurial path and production direction of this chemical factory were of typical significance and should be enthusiastically supported and widely promoted.

The Duanjia Commune Party committee members sat around a conference table and passed such a resolution: the chemical factory should immediately increase personnel, expand production, and be placed under the leadership of the commune.

Of course, He Wenyi didn't know these things, but he firmly believed: "As long as what you do is beneficial to the people, the Party will definitely support it greatly!"

In early April, a batch of new forces came to the factory.

Then, the housing problem was solved, and a fertilizer workshop, a bacteria workshop, and a pesticide workshop were established separately...

Comrade Shi Daoduo, the first secretary of the county Party committee, came to see them and gave a lot of encouragement.

The secretary of the Youth League general branch also moved his luggage here, preparing to live here for a long time.

In early July, the provincial and county Youth League committees held an on-site meeting here. Representatives from all communes in the county, representatives from counties and cities directly under the province of Shaanxi, and the secretary of the provincial Youth League committee all came.

A learn from He Wenyi, catch up with He Wenyi, and surpass He Wenyi movement was launched among the youth in Dali County.

Was all this change very sudden? No, it is like this in our society. Here, there are no buried geniuses, no suppressed seedlings. Every point of light and every point of heat will be cherished and valued by the Party. The Party helps thousands upon thousands of young people turn their ideals into reality.

In this direction, He Wenyi is even busier, he has to receive visitors, go out to give reports, teach the new comrades, and often hold meetings until after twelve o'clock. However, during the day, whether it is next to the pot of fertilizer being boiled, on the high-altitude cableway transporting green soil, or in front of the stove burning the autoclave, you will often find this energetic young man wearing a blue striped coarse cloth shirt. In the evening, when the night is quiet, you can see him hunched over under the kerosene lamp, diligently reading and taking notes.

Wenyi has become more humble. If you ask him: "Wenyi, where do you get such endless energy?" He will answer very sincerely: "The Party and the people have cultivated me and given me such great honor, and science is a vast ocean. I haven't studied for a few days, so I can't not work hard!"

Yes, science is a vast ocean. Today, the brave Chinese youth are advancing with the momentum of ten thousand ships setting sail. The Party, like the North Star, will always point out the correct direction for us. Hundreds of millions of people, muster up a strong east wind to blow our sails,

Waves embrace the wind, the wind embraces the waves,

The colors of heaven and earth have changed,

High mountains give way.

Young scientists, brave soldiers, cross one wave peak after another, advance, advance!

    坚韧学习科学　一心建设农村
    ——记何文义和他领导的共青团化工厂
    王宗元　李振东　程渡　朱玉田
    这是在洛河边上的卿避村，共青团陕西省委和大荔县委正在这里召开现场会议。
    作报告的人身量不高，年纪不过二十岁左右吧，穿着一件蓝条土布衫子，两只手常常举到胸前，打着各种比喻。
    他转过身，在黑板上写出：
    第三部分——细菌肥料
    “同志们，植物生长需要三种要素，那就是氮、磷、钾……空气里面本来有许多氮，可是这些氮不能被植物直接吸收……有一种细菌，名叫‘固氮菌’，它是一个小小的工厂……”
    坐着听讲的有两三百人，一点声息也没有，几百支笔飞舞在几百个笔记本上，发出沙沙声。
    他是谁？是大学教授吗？是化学专家吗？不是。他只是一个念过半年高小的青年农民，名叫何文义。
    就是他，两年前连一个化学符号都认不得的小伙子，在总路线、大跃进、人民公社三面红旗的鼓舞下，苦钻猛干，力攻科学堡垒，制造和发明了各种化肥、菌肥、农药及其他化学工艺品一百一十七种——一双勇敢的手撕开了化学工艺和细菌制造的神秘帷幕。
    他所领导的这个工厂，两年来换了三个名称：起先叫“土化肥厂”后来叫“细菌肥料厂”现在叫“大荔县段家公社共青团化工厂”，他们的产品陈列在一间大厅里：
    这里是硝酸钾、氨水、植物生长刺激素、硫铵、土尿素……
    这里是固氮菌、磷细菌、钾细菌、金霉素、地霉素……
    这里是土赛力散、苯硫二剂、1605、1059、牛癣药水、百日咳药粉……
    社员们亲切的叫他们是“万全化工厂”——生产上需要什么，这里就供给什么。
    他们坚持为农业服务的方针，两年来，制出各种化肥、菌肥一百九十万斤（可供全公社每亩施用二十四斤），农药六万斤，还有其他多种产品。可以说，段家原上每一棵迎风摇摆的麦穗，每一朵含笑绽开的棉花，都曾经从这个小小的化工厂里取得营养呢！
    他们坚持“勤俭办厂，以土代洋”的方针。走遍他们的车间，能够称得上“现代”设备的，只有几支温度表，一个新添的高压灭菌器，一副土壤速测箱。而那些蒸馍的笼，盛水的缸，煮饭的锅和各处搜集来的玻璃瓶子，在这一群大无畏的青年人手中发挥了神奇的作用。
    “我的前途就在这里！”
    开始，他们三个人——何文义，何有生，何家则——在戏楼底下搭起三口铁锅，就动手熬制颗粒肥料和土尿素。
    富裕中农出身的何家则才上阵就不想干了，说他胃口不好，闻到臭气就反胃——这是个大空场子，附近连棵树也没有，三伏天的太阳当头晒着，拌大粪的气味、蒸骨头的气味、熬尿的气味熏的人头昏脑胀，当然不是一件舒服事。
    何文义说：“行，你的胃不好，你去筛土好啦！”何家则念过几天初中，觉得自己有点文化，一面摇筛子一面叹气：“这会有什么前途呢！”
    何文义却拣着最苦、最肮脏的事情自己做。每天清早挨家挨户去倒尿盆、掏茅厕，像找金子似的四处搜寻死猫烂老鼠和各种骨头。
    当他挑着粪担从村中走过时，有些妇女老远就捂住鼻子，唧唧喳喳的喊叫：“文义，你算把咱一村都臭完了！”文义却笑嘻嘻的说：
  “这怕什么！没有臭的能吃上香的？”有些人在背后猜测说：“文义准是犯下错误了，要不，他当团支书的为什么整天担大粪呢？”
    回到家里，老婆也嫌他脏，不许他进房子，不跟他一桌吃饭，不给他洗衣服，说：“你看你，当团支书的就弄这些事呀？”
      “这是党给的光荣任务！”
    “光荣？衣服没人给你洗！”
      “没人洗我自己洗，那有破不开的芝麻秆！”文义笑了笑，拿起那沾满了污渍的汗衫，跨出门，挑上粪担子走了。
    不久，又发生了第二次争吵。
    那时厂里已经增加到十八个人，乡党委要求他们十天中间突击三十万斤土化肥，以便给秋田追肥。恰遇到省里几家工厂来招考徒工，熬肥锅旁边起了波动，何家则等人撇下这“没有前途”的地方去考大工厂了。
    何文义急得火油煎心，老婆却劝他：“文义，你看人家都去考大工厂了，你怎么这样傻？你又是团员，政治条件又好，要想想自己的前途呀！”
    何文义说：“我的前途就在这里！”
    老婆生气的问：“放着大工厂不进，成天担大粪，这就是你的前途？”
    何文义也生了气，手指门外，斩钢截铁的喊道：“我要把这厂办到底，党的任务完不成，我那里也不去！”
    上天入地找骨头
    在党支部的帮助下，展开了一番辩论：“土化肥厂有没有前途？”问题辩论清楚了，大家思想提高了，就都安下心来，鼓起了干劲，没有人再嫌脏怕臭，没有人再偷偷溜回队上去了。小伙子们日夜轮班的战斗起来，三支烟洞滚滚不停的冒着浓烟，产品像一座座小山似的涌到场子上。
    “骨头不够用了！”三十万斤土化肥要三万斤骨头，那里能找到这么多呢？派出去的人，走遍了附近村庄，搜遍了深沟陡?，带回来的骨头一天比一天少了。
    有一天，何文义从乡上开会回来，看到沟边放着一只筐，搭着半截绳子，往前一看，“可不得了！”徐根茂吊在半崖上不知在做什么。“根茂，你不要命啦？这三、四丈的高崖是开玩笑的吗？”何文义着急的喊。可是徐根茂却高兴的喊道：“你看这是什么？”原来他两只手一边举着一块牛腿骨。
    何文义眼里射出惊喜的光芒：“骨头！还有没有？多少哩？”
    “多哩，不知道是古时的井窖还是墓子？就在这半崖上，里面还有呢！”
    何文义顾不得再问，立刻把绳子拴到自己腰上，说：“根茂，你拉住，慢慢往下放！”
    徐根茂说：“不行，你不是说危险吗？”
      “不要多说了，把绳拽牢！”
    何文义拿着镢头溜到半崖，在崖上掏了个立脚的地方，仔细一看，果然土里埋的骨头很多，他忘掉了危险，高兴的大喊：“根茂，快回去叫人，可发现了宝库了！”
    光这一个窖，他们就刨出六千来斤牛、马骨头。
    何文义想：“是不是还会有这样的地方？”他就回到村里向老年人请教。一个姓雷的老人说：“光绪年间闹牛瘟，村里的一口废井里面扔进去不少死牛！”
    这伙青年人，叫着喊着跑去了，找到那口湮没已久的土井。刨下去一丈多，就有一股臭气冲上来，越往下刨，气味越浓了，油灯放下去就灭了，人也在里面支持不住。
    何文义又去请教那姓雷的老人，老人说：“井埋了多年，那些臭气走不出来！你们这么……”老人叫何文义寻一只筐，筐上拴一段绳，一上一下在筒里摆动。“这样阴气就流动开了！”
    他们照这办法弄起来，果然有效，灯能点着了，人能下去了，在这个井底下，又挖出来三千多斤骨头。
    这时，乡党委发出号召，全乡掀起一个“支援化肥厂”运动。各村各队都来给他们送骨头。业余技校和小学校的学生们，从深沟里给他们抬运硝土，党委书记的自行车后面也经常捎着几块骨头……
    得到群众的热烈支持，十天中间，他们造出了三十三万斤土化肥。
    “你回去吧，再换个人来！”
    何文义跟着县里组织的参观团到西安、太原、石家庄等地去参观了一趟。亲眼看到大跃进中的祖国，到处一片澎湃沸腾的气象，特别是在党的总路线鼓舞下，千千万万像自己一样的青年人，大胆攻科学，双手创奇迹，使他受到很大的激励。
    何文义从参观学回来“砖面培养”制造细菌的办法，这个厂开始制造“自生固氮菌”。不过这是一种土办法，产量不高，质量也不够好。听说大荔农校在用“洋法”生产细菌肥料，何文义立刻蹬上自行车跑去了。
    “噢，欢迎欢迎！”负责指导菌肥厂的王老师，口里这样说，两眼却不住的打量这土里土气的青年人。“学习制菌要有几个条件，一个是高中程度，最低也要初中毕业……”他听说何文义只念过半年高小，便连连摇头说：“你回去吧，再换个人来。”搞细菌不简单，弄不好有危险哩！”
    何文义要求给简单的介绍一下，王老师很不耐烦的说：“我问你，你有细菌概念吗？”他顺手在纸上画了一串化学符号。“这些你能看懂？”
    何文义木然的楞在那里，他的确看不懂。王老师转身去上课了。
      “不能回去。制造细菌肥料这是党给的任务！”何文义扑了扑身上的灰尘，在教室门口蹲下来。
    王老师下了课，惊讶的看到何文义仍旧站在教室门口。
      “王老师，能不能叫我进去看一下？”何文义指着制菌室的门说。
    “咳！”王老师皱着眉头说：“这不能随便进去，恐怕带进去杂菌，这里面有电温箱、电冰箱、高压灭菌器，还有灭菌用的紫外线灯……光这套设备就要一万多块钱，何况目前缺货，有钱也买不到！”
      “有什么土办法能代替吗？”
      “这我们还没有研究！”
    何文义一把拉住王老师的衣服，着急的说：“能不能请你打开窗帘，让从外面看一看？”
      “不行，细菌怕阳光！”
    王老师拒绝了这个请求，走了。何文义一个人站在那里，面对着小小的制菌室，看着那遮得严严实实的窗帘，牙齿咬得格崩崩响：“细菌啊细菌！你就有这么神秘？你就有这么难？王老师啊王老师！你就不肯把门打开一个缝缝吗？”
    戳穿细菌的神秘
    回到公社党委，何文义找到貟书记，汇报了经过。
    “人家说至少要初中毕业的程度……”。貟书记给这满头冒汗的小伙子倒了一杯水，说：“有个王保京，你知道不知道？”
    “王保京我怎么不知道，我们还一块开过会呢！”
    “王保京他有多高的文化程度？”
      “对，我还要去！”何文义推开茶杯站起来。“那有破不开的芝麻秆！”
    “等一等！”貟书记拦住了他。“党委给你们写一封信……”
    第二天，何文义拿着信，同着另外三个青年，来到大荔农校党委办公室。
    党委负责同志热情的接待了他们，亲自带到王老师那里，说：“一定要负责把他们教会，他们要学什么就给他们教什么！”
    王老师看到何文义又来了，这个青年的顽强精神，使他受到感动。
    在学校住了三天，从接种到固体培养、液体培养、灭菌、菌液拌合他们都学会了。何文义心里高兴的说：“这也没有多难哪！”他一边学，一边考虑着“以土代洋”的问题。
      “我们回去，没有温箱，能不能用别的代替？”何文义向一个姓李的同学请教。
    “不要紧，有热炕也可以，只要能保持二十五度到三十度的温度就行！”
    “我们也没有这样的无菌室呀！”跟何文义同来的女副厂长蒙如月发愁的说。
    何文义说：“弄一间房子，把它好好糊一下，再用六六六和硫磺熏一熏，不知道行不行？”
      “行！”那姓李的同学说。“只要能消除杂菌，能保住温度，固氮菌培养并不太难。有什么问题，你们以后可以随时来找我们！”
    他们回到卿避村，恰好给北京菌肥厂和苏州菌肥厂写信要的材料都寄来了，这就更增加了他们的信心，“你看，几千里外都伸出手来支援咱们呢！”
    过了十多天，何文义又来到大荔农校，手里拿着一支玻璃管，笑嘻嘻的说：
    “王老师，我们从西安买回来一些菌种，请你化验一下，看行不行？”
    王老师接在手里，看了看，放在显微镜底下观察了半天，又做了抗强力的试验，点头说：“菌苗很好！”
    何文义忍不住要笑，问：“比学校造出来的怎样？”
      “差不多，质量还不错！”
    “谢谢你，王老师！”何文义一出门就哈哈大笑起来。
    过了不久，县科学普及协会打来电话：
    “喂，是王老师吗？何文义他们培养出来的固氮菌……你化验过了？……”
    “什么？是他们培养出来的？”王老师吃惊的问。
    送话器里传来何文义的声音：“王老师，实在对不起你，请你不要生气……”
    王老师这时觉得又惭愧，又高兴，又惊奇。下了课他就骑上自行车朝卿避村跑去。
    那时候，何文义他们是“地下工厂”——因为没有地方，他们收拾了几孔人家存放糠秕的地下烂窑，自己又在崖半腰打了几孔小窑洞——王老师找了很久才找到，他拨开荆棘杂草，下到“车间”，一伙子青年人都在雾腾腾的蒸气里；蒸瓶子的蒸瓶子，接种的接种，拌菌的拌菌，有说有笑，十分热闹。
    何文义领着王老师参观了各个“车间”，也看了他们制出的第一批成品。
    青年人的这种干劲，这种创造精神，深深感动了这位教师：他们的温箱是一只竖柜，里面点了盏煤油灯，外面包着两层棉被。他们的灭菌器就是蒸馍笼，洋芋水代替了洋菜液，冷窑洞代替了冰箱。没有白金接种环，竹筷上绑了个铁丝圈；没有接种管，跟卫生所要来些盛葡萄糖的针管……
    王老师暗自点头佩服：“真是海水不可斗量啊！”他答应留下来，帮他们解决了操作上的一些问题。
    一批批的细菌肥料，不断从这“地下工厂”运出去。1958年，段家公社有四万亩小麦施用了他们制造的固氮菌。
    “胡成精”变成“百宝箱”
      “科学”像一座高山，横在何文义前进的道路上，由于不认得化学符号，有一次他们寄了一些水到西安去化验，可是寄回来的化验单，谁也看不懂，只好跑几十里路到城里请人看。由于不知道硝酸钾就是土硝，硫酸钙就是石膏，硫酸亚铁就是青矾……有时手头有这种原料，却还要派人出去买。至于看不懂化学上的分子式、分子量，不会计算，给工作上不知增加了多少困难……现在何文义还保存着早先一个笔记本，上面画满了圈圈、××、杠杠和他自己
  “创造”的各种“符号”，有时记下些配料单，拿回来他自己也看不懂了。
      “那有破不开的芝麻秆！”何文义爱说这么句话。他就用这样的精神，劈开困难，夺取知识，钻研创造，勇往直前。
    这个平日不肯枉花一文钱的青年，进了城连一碗凉粉也舍不得吃的人，成了新华书店的经常顾客，他如饥似渴的攻读着化学、物理、肥料讲义、算术、中药学、兽医手册……他的胳臂上，手背上，常常写满了各种符号和不认识的字。
    他学到一点，马上就试验，就应用。“即学即用”是他学习中的一大特色。
    有时，他为了研究一种东西，就把行李搬到阴湿的窑洞里，十天半月钻在里面。有时，他带上几个馍，整天到野外跑，一会下到沟底，一会爬上山坡，仔细观察着各种土壤和野生植物。有时，他想什么想呆了，两眼直瞪瞪的走在路上，别人招呼他他也听不见。有时，他整夜整夜的看书，记笔记。瞌睡了，就扒在小桌上打个盹，额前的头发被烧卷了，同志们开玩笑叫他“烫发头”，他自己却不知道。
    这些行动，开头有些人看不惯，管他叫
  “胡成精”“熬干油”。可是，后来一件件的事实封住了他们的嘴。何文义的发明创造，一桩桩取得了鲜明的效果，社员们亲切的叫他“百宝箱”，地里要肥料找他，庄稼起了虫找他，牛长了癣找他，甚至小娃害了病也找他。
    农活正忙时，牛起了癣，传染的很厉害，有些牛很快的乏瘦下来。饲养员来找何文义，他造出一种“牛癣药水”，这种药水效果很好，不但能治愈癣疥，还能使掉了毛的地方照旧长出毛来，全公社四百多头害癣的牛，都用这种药水治好了。
    小麦条锈病严重，生产队长发愁的说：
  “文义，你有什么办法吗？”“好，我来研究研究！”后来就创造出一种命名为“苯硫二剂”的药，这种药品洒到麦田里，一方面可以杀死病菌，一方面还有追肥的作用。
    村里孩子们害起百日咳，何文义记起某一本书里说鸡苦胆可以治百日咳，他弄来一些鸡苦胆，用各种方法加以处理，最后提炼出一种药剂。“究竟有没有效用呢？”恰好他自己也在害咳嗽，他就挖了一匙吃下去，这一下可坏了，又拉又吐，像中了毒一样，这时正在深夜，周围一个人也没有，第二天清早，人们发现他直僵僵的倒在窑洞门口。
    大家把他抬到家里，党支部书记听见消息，马上同着医生来了。何文义刚睁开眼，就说：“派人……把药拿……到卫生院……”
    经过解救，何文义脱离了危险。卫生院写来一封信，说：“鸡苦胆素”对百日咳有效，可以试用，至于发生“中毒”的情形，是因为吃得太多了……何文义躺在炕上读了这封信，脸上露出了笑容。
    村里十二个害百日咳的孩子，都用这种药治好了，消息传了出去，几十里外的人都跑来寻药，半夜里还有人来敲“化工厂”的大门呢！
    两年来，在研究试验过程中，何文义不只一次中毒、昏倒、受病。可是他怕大家替他担心，总是尽量隐瞒着。公社党委书记和大队支部书记见面就说他：“文义呀，看你气色不好，又害病了吗？要当心身体啊！”文义只是笑笑，说：“没什么，我好着哩！”他心里暗自说：“研究科学么，和打仗一样，还能碰不着一点！多少大科学家为事业献出了生命，我，一个在党的怀抱里长大的共青团员，能做一个科学上的黄继光、丘少云，那该是最大的光荣！”
    乘风破浪继续前进
    1960年春天的一个夜晚，夜已深了，何文义仍旧在煤油灯下，在那一堆瓶瓶罐罐中间忙碌着。
    他不知道，就在这时候，在几十里外的中共大荔县委的会议室里，正在讨论着他。开了一整天会的县委书记和县委委员们，在注意的听取贺国强书记关于何文义和他领导的这个化工厂的报告，人们点着头，交换着简短的意见。这里是党的指挥部、司令台，党的英明的眼睛，时刻在注意着地平线上出现的每一个新的事物，新的萌芽。县委会指出：何文义艰苦钻研，大胆创造的精神和这个化工厂的创业道路、生产方向是有典型意义的，应该热烈支持，普遍推广。
    段家公社党委委员们，坐在一张会议桌周围，通过了这样的决议：化工厂应立即增加人员，扩大生产，划归公社领导。
    当然，这些事情何文义是不知道的，但他坚决相信：“只要自己做的是于人民有益的事，党一定会大力支持的！”
    4月初，一批新生力量来到厂里。
    接着，解决了房子问题，分别成立了化肥车间、细菌车间、农药车间……
    县委第一书记师道铎同志来看他们，给了许多鼓励。
    团总支书记把行李也搬来了，准备长期住在这里。
    7月初，省、县团委在这里召开现场会议，全县各公社的代表，陕西省直属县市的代表，团省委书记都来了。
    大荔县青年中间，展开了一个学何文义、赶何文义、超何文义运动。
    这一切变化很突然吗？不，在我们社会里，就是这样。这里，没有被埋没的天才，没有被抑压的幼苗，一分光，一分热，都会被党珍惜重视。党，帮助千千万万青年把理想变为现实。
    这一向，何文义是更忙碌了，要接待参观的人，要出去做报告，要给新来的同志们上课，经常开会开到十二点以后，可是，在白天，不管熬制肥料的锅旁，运输青土的高线滑车台上，或是烧着高压灭菌器的炉灶前，你经常会发现这个穿着蓝条子粗布衫的精力饱满的小伙子。在晚上，当夜深人静的时候，你又可以看到他伏在煤油灯下，孜孜不倦的读书，做笔记。
    文义变得更谦虚了，如果问他：“文义，你那里来的这样无穷的精力呢？”他会很诚恳的回答：“党和人民把我培养起来，给了我这么大的荣誉，而科学是一片汪洋大海，我没念过几天书，不努力可不行啊！”
    是的，科学是一片汪洋大海，今天，勇敢的中国青年，正以万船齐发之势，破浪前进。党，像北极星一样永远为我们指出正确的方向，亿万人民，鼓起强大的东风吹送我们的帆，
    浪拥着风，风拥着浪，
    天地变了色，
    高山把路让。
    年轻的科学家，勇敢的战士们，越过一个浪峰又一个浪峰，前进，前进吧！
