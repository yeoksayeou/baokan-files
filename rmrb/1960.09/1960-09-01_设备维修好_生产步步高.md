Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, 31st—Jinzhong area of Shanxi province is taking the method of connecting metallurgy factories with machinery factories, providing counterpart assistance, and assigning responsibility for specific areas to vigorously strengthen the maintenance and repair work of metallurgical equipment. Now, most iron plants in the area have generally established machine repair workshops and formulated equipment inspection and maintenance systems, thereby increasing the opening rate of small blast furnaces to over 82%, and the area's pig iron and steel production is rising every ten days.

After adopting the method of connecting metallurgy factories with machinery factories, scattered machine repair forces were organized, and the potential of existing equipment was fully utilized. At the same time, temporary cooperation and connections were fixed in the form of counterpart assistance, combining emergency repairs and regular maintenance, thereby promoting the sustained leap forward in the steel industry.

Currently, there are three main forms of connection being promoted throughout the area: one is that larger machinery factories are responsible for a specific region, and smaller machinery factories are responsible for a specific county; the second is that counties with very weak mechanical capabilities transfer a certain amount of machine repair force to jointly form an equipment maintenance team responsible for equipment inspection and repair in the jointly responsible area; the third form is that county-run machinery factories and steel plants cooperate on a counterpart basis. Now, all counties with machinery factories have established a connection system with local iron plants, conducting regular inspections and producing spare parts and components for cooperative factories. Fenyang, Jiaocheng, Wenshui, Pingyao, Jiexiu, and Taigu counties, which have weak mechanical capabilities, have concentrated a number of mobile maintenance forces and carried out multiple rounds of mobile inspections. Jingwei Textile Machinery Factory, Jinhua Textile Factory, and Yangquan Mining Bureau and other larger factories and mines are assigned large areas of responsibility for large-scale equipment inspection and the manufacture of important parts. In the past month or so, according to the scope of the large-area division of labor, they have transferred a total of seventy-two veteran technical workers to form four shock repair teams, which went to various counties along the East Mountain area, the West Mountain area, the Tongpu Railway line, and the Taifen Highway to carry out emergency repairs. In just over a month, they repaired more than twenty large-scale equipment items, manufactured more than two thousand sets of various spare parts and components, and trained more than fifty technical talents for these areas. At the same time, they also organized a fixed mobile repair team to conduct regular mobile inspections to help factories solve the repair of large machinery and the manufacture of spare parts.

With the counterpart support of the machinery factories, the area's thirty-two iron smelting units have also trained a large number of machine repair personnel and established twenty-eight machine repair workshops; about half of these machine repair workshops have already undertaken the task of manufacturing spare parts for their own factories, and the remaining factories can also undertake simple repair and manufacturing tasks.

Xinhua News Agency, Fuxin, 30th—The Central Machine Repair Factory of Fuxin Mining Bureau is adopting the method of "serving households and repairing and supplying parts on-site" to actively support the increased production and frugality campaign being carried out by coal mining workers. Their slogan is: To ensure high coal production with high-efficiency, high-quality equipment. Under the unified leadership of the factory's Party committee, the factory's employees have established six electromechanical equipment maintenance shock teams, including vehicle, fitter, riveter, forging, welding, and transportation workers; in addition to one team staying in the factory to produce spare parts, the other five teams have adopted the method of "serving households and repairing and supplying parts on-site," carrying a large number of spare parts and going to the front lines of production in Xinqiu, Ping'an, Qinghemen and other coal mines to carry out major equipment inspections. Wei Bingku, deputy secretary of the factory's Party committee, and Han Liwen, deputy director of the factory, led the maintenance shock team to Ping'an Mine and carried out inspection work in the rain. They spent only seven days repairing one hundred iron coal trucks, which would have taken two months in the past, ensuring the transportation needs of high coal production.

The shock team specially organized by the factory to manufacture mining machinery parts has also recently rushed to produce a large number of spare parts for coal mines, such as electric shovels, electric locomotives, and water pumps, and actively delivered them to the front lines of coal mining, which has been unanimously praised by the miners.

Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, 30th—In the past month or so, the employees of the Wuhan Iron and Steel Corporation's Ironmaking Plant have recovered more than 700 tons of various waste steel materials and more than 6,000 pieces of old equipment in more than 100 categories. They used these waste materials to produce a large number of spare parts and components, greatly strengthened equipment maintenance and repair work, and saved the state more than 500,000 yuan in wealth.

The employees of the blast furnace and raw materials workshop first organized a conservation team, established a conservation warehouse, and established a processing plant. They arranged a certain amount of time, collecting a large number of waste products on the one hand and repairing old equipment to revive it on the other. They adopted the methods of two-in-one and three-in-one for long-term idle and unused waste equipment, making up for what was lacking and repairing it to revive it. Within a short period of time, they repaired more than 100 valuable electrical materials. Employees in other workshops also adopted the above methods to set up a batch of small processing plants. The sintering workshop employees also established a conservation shock team and set up more than 20 conservation warehouses, recovering more than 500 pieces of motors, idlers, supports, etc., greatly increasing the storage of spare parts and components. Meng Hefu, a scaffolding worker in this workshop, saw that the rivets ordered by the workshop from outside factories had not arrived for a long time, so he and two other workers cleaned up a site, built a stove, found some hammers, pliers, and iron drills as tools, and used waste steel bars as raw materials to set up a small iron factory. In the past month, this small factory has produced more than 10,000 rivets, meeting the production and maintenance needs of the workshop and supporting other workshops. Meng Hefu's spirit of diligence and thrift in construction has deeply educated the vast number of employees, who call him "Little Meng Tai" and put forward the slogan of "learning from Little Meng Tai and surpassing Little Meng Tai." In the past, if the equipment in the electromechanical section of the sintering workshop broke down, whether it was major, medium, or minor repairs, it had to be sent outside the factory for repair. Now, medium and minor repairs can be done without leaving the factory. In the past, the three major spare parts (motors, rivets, idlers) were felt to be insufficient. Now, due to the small factories' repair, revival, processing, and manufacturing, production needs have been met, and more than 100 recovered idlers have been supplied to the coking plant.

    设备维修好　生产步步高
    晋中地区钢铁厂同机械厂挂钩加强冶金设备维修工作
    阜新矿中央机修厂“服务到户，修配上门”效果良好
    武钢炼铁厂回收和修复废旧器材扩大备品、备件储量
    新华社太原31日电　山西省晋中地区采取冶金厂同机械厂挂钩对口、分片包干的办法，大力加强冶金设备的维护检修工作。现在，全区大部分铁厂都普遍建立起机修车间，制定了设备检修维护制度，从而使小高炉开炉率提高到82％以上，全区生铁和钢的产量逐旬上升。
    采用冶金厂同机械厂挂钩对口的办法以后，把分散的机修力量组织起来，充分发挥了现有设备的潜力；同时，还把临时的协作联系用挂钩对口的形式固定下来，使突击抢修和经常维护结合了起来，从而促进了钢铁工业生产的持续跃进。
    目前全区推行的挂钩形式主要有三种：一种是较大的机械厂负责包片，小型机械厂负责包县；第二种是，机械力量十分薄弱的县抽调一定的机修力量，共同组成设备维修队伍，负责联包地区的设备检修；第三种形式是各县营机械厂和钢铁厂对口协作。现在凡是有机械厂的县都同当地的铁厂建立了联系制度，定期进行检修和为协作厂生产备品备件。机械力量薄弱的汾阳、交城、文水、平遥、介休和太谷等县，已经集中了一批机动检修力量，进行了多次巡回检修。经纬纺织机械厂、晋华纺织厂和阳泉矿务局等较大厂矿，都按大片分工，进行大宗设备的检修和重要配件的制造。最近一个多月中，他们按照大片分工的范围，共抽调七十二个老技术工人，组成四支突击检修队伍，分赴东山地区、西山地区、同蒲沿线和太汾公路沿线各县，突击检修。一个多月的时间共检修各种大型设备二十多台件，制造各种配件零件两千多套，并且为这些地区培养了五十多个技术人才。同时，他们还组织了一支固定的巡回检修队，作定期的巡回检修，帮助各厂解决大型机械的修理和配件制造。
    全区三十二个炼铁单位在机械厂的对口支援下，还培养了大批机修人员，建立起了二十八个机修车间；其中有一半左右的机修车间已经担负起本厂配件的制造任务，其余的厂也都能担负起简单的修造任务。
    新华社阜新30日电　阜新矿务局中央机修厂采用“服务到户，修配上门”的办法，积极支援采煤职工正在开展着的增产节约运动。他们的行动口号是：以高效率的优质设备保证煤炭高额增产。这个厂的职工在厂党委的统一领导下，已经成立了六个包括车、钳、铆、锻、焊、运输等工种的机电设备检修突击队；除开一个队留在工厂突击制造配件以外，其他五个队都采取
  “服务到户、修配上门”的办法，携带着大批配件分别深入新丘、平安、清河门等煤矿生产第一线，展开了设备大检修。厂党委副书记魏秉库和副厂长韩立文率领的检修突击队深入到平安矿以后，冒雨进行检修工作。他们仅用七天的时间，就修完了过去需要两个月才能修完的一百台铁煤车，保证了煤炭高产的运输需要。
    厂里专门组织的制造矿山机械配件的突击队，最近也为煤矿赶制了大批电铲、电机车、水泵等配件，并且主动地送到采煤第一线，受到了矿工们的一致好评。
    据新华社武汉30日电　武钢炼铁厂职工在最近的一个多月里，回收了各种废钢材七百多吨，旧器材百多种共六千多件。他们运用这些废旧器材生产了大量备品备件，大大加强了设备维护检修工作，并为国家节约了五十万元以上的财富。
    这个厂高炉、原料车间的职工首先组织了节约队，建立了节约仓库，成立了加工厂。他们安排出一定的时间，一面大量收集废品，一面整旧复活，把长期闲置未用的废旧器材采取两合一、三合一的方法，缺啥补啥修整复活，短期内就修复了一百多件贵重电器材料。其他车间职工也采用以上的办法，办起了一批小加工厂。烧结车间职工还成立了节约突击队，并且办起了二十多个节约仓库，回收马达、托轮、支架等五百多件，大大增加了备品备件的储量。这个车间的架工孟合富看见车间向外厂订购的铆钉长期没有到货，就同另外两个工人一道，清扫了一块场地，筑了个炉子，找了些锤子、钳子、铁钻作工具，用废钢筋作原料，办起了个小铁工厂。一个月来，这个小工厂打了一万多个铆钉，满足了本车间生产、维修需要，还支援了其他车间。孟合富这种勤俭建设的精神，深深地教育了广大职工，他们称他为“小孟泰”，提出了“学习小孟泰，超过小孟泰”的口号。烧结车间机电工段过去设备坏了，不管是大修、中修、小修，都要送往厂外检修，现在作到了中修小修不出厂。过去三大备品（马达、铆钉、托轮）感到不足，现在由于小工厂检修复活、加工制造，已经满足了生产需要，还把回收的一百多个托轮支援了焦化厂。
