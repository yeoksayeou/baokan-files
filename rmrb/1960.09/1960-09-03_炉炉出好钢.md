Every Furnace Produces Good Steel

At the beginning of this year, when the workers of the Tianjin Second Steel Plant were discussing the annual production plan, the Yang Desheng group proposed a guarantee that no matter how high the sulfur content of pig iron was, they would refine good steel and strive to produce no rejects. At the time, some people doubted: "It's easier said than done. We'll see the results!" What was the result? From January to August 29, they had continuously produced eight hundred and forty heats without rejects, and with high output, low consumption, and no accidents.

The Yang Desheng group has eleven members. Except for Yang Desheng, all are new workers. Yang Desheng pays great attention to ideological work. He strengthened political study within the group, led the workers to frequently discuss major national events, studied the production situation of fraternal factories in China and in Tianjin, and united Party members, Youth League members, and activists to help those with ideological problems raise their awareness. Everyone in the group was proud to be a steelworker, dedicated to steel, and treated the factory as their home, establishing a high sense of responsibility for production. Once, while refining steel on a rainy night, when adding ferromanganese, the charging worker Zhao Zhongde found that the ferromanganese had been rained on and was very damp. He immediately stopped it from entering the furnace. It was not until everyone baked the ferromanganese dry that it was put into the furnace, avoiding a possible accident.

Yang Desheng and all the workers not only paid attention to constantly summarizing their own experience, but also humbly and earnestly learned from others. They studied and tested the experiences learned from the Shanghai Third Steel Plant, Tangshan Steel Plant, and Tianjin Third Steel Plant, and summarized a complete set of advanced operating methods such as "small slag volume operation" and "five desulfurizations." This set of methods can deal with high-sulfur iron with various sulfur contents. They also established a post responsibility system, with everyone checking to prevent high sulfur from succeeding.

Although the Yang Desheng group did not make any requests to the pig iron furnace when proposing the guarantee to refine good steel with high-sulfur iron, they did not ignore the role of the pig iron furnace section in overcoming high sulfur. Every time after starting work, Yang Desheng went to the pig iron furnace section to understand the desulfurization situation and help remove slag and desulfurize. Sometimes, Yang Desheng also led workers to assist the pig iron furnace section in transporting iron and coke, creating favorable conditions for high-quality and high-yield converter steel.

    炉炉出好钢
    今年年初，天津第二钢厂职工讨论全年生产计划的时候，杨德生小组就提出保证，不论生铁含硫多高，也要炼出好钢，力争不出废品。当时有人怀疑：“说时容易做时难，将来看结果吧！”结果怎样呢？从1月到8月29日，他们已经连续八百四十炉无废品，而且产量高，消耗低，没有发生任何事故。
    杨德生小组共有十一个人。除了杨德生以外，都是新工人。杨德生很注意作思想工作。他加强了组内的政治学习，带动工人们经常在一起畅谈天下大事，研究国内和本市各兄弟厂的生产情况，并且团结党、团员和积极分子帮助有思想问题的人提高觉悟。全小组人人都以做炼钢工人为荣，以钢为业，以厂为家，对生产建立起了高度的责任感。有一次雨夜炼钢，在加锰铁的时候，加料工人赵忠德发现锰铁被雨淋过，十分潮湿，他立即挡住，不让锰铁进炉。直到大家把锰铁烤干以后才入炉，避免了一次可能发生的事故。
    杨德生和全组工人既注意不断总结自己的经验，又虚心认真地向别人学习。他们把从上钢三厂、唐山钢厂、天津第三钢厂学到的经验进行研究、试验，总结出“小渣量操作”和“五次脱硫”等成套的先进操作方法。这套方法可以对付各种不同含硫量的高硫铁。他们还建立起岗位责任制，人人把关，不给高硫留下一点得逞的机会。
    杨德生小组虽然在提出用高硫铁炼好钢的保证时，没有向化铁炉提出任何要求，但是他们并没有忽视化铁炉工段在战胜高硫中的作用。每次上班以后，杨德生都到化铁炉工段了解脱硫情况，帮助扒渣，脱硫。有时候，杨德生还带领工人援助化铁炉工段运铁，运焦炭，为转炉钢优质高产创造有利条件。
