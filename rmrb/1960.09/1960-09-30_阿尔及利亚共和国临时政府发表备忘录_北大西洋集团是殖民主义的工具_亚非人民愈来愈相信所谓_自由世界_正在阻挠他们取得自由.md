Xinhua News Agency, September 29th dispatch from Tunis: The Information Department of the Provisional Government of the Republic of Algeria distributed a memorandum to the press on the 28th, condemning the North Atlantic Treaty Organization aggressor bloc. The memorandum states that the North Atlantic Treaty Organization "is a tool of colonialism, currently specifically opposing the Algerian people and becoming a factor of insecurity for the entire Maghreb (referring to North Africa, including the regions of Morocco, Algeria, and Tunisia)."

The memorandum points out that the member states of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization "provide France with massive material and diplomatic support, which has definitively included the North Atlantic Treaty Organization in the ranks of colonialist pacts."

The memorandum also states that the member states of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, "by continuing to support the Algerian war with all means, are alienating themselves from the sympathy of the people of Asian and African countries. The people of Asian and African countries increasingly believe that the so-called free world is doing everything possible to prevent their victory of freedom and independence." The memorandum states that the Provisional Government of the Republic of Algeria has learned all the lessons from these facts.

The memorandum again severely condemns the French government for forcibly incorporating Algeria into the North Atlantic Treaty area and for using its bases in Morocco and Tunisia to "continue its aggression against the Algerian people." The memorandum reveals that France's use of the Bizerte air and naval base in Tunisia is a prominent example. Some American planes used by France in Algeria are repaired in Morocco, and these American-made planes have killed children coming out of school when bombing Tunisian villages.

　　阿尔及利亚共和国临时政府发表备忘录
　　北大西洋集团是殖民主义的工具
    亚非人民愈来愈相信所谓“自由世界”正在阻挠他们取得自由
    新华社29日讯　突尼斯消息：阿尔及利亚共和国临时政府宣传部28日向报界分发一项备忘录，谴责北大西洋公约侵略组织。备忘录说，北大西洋公约组织“是殖民主义的工具，现在正特别反对阿尔及利亚人民并且成为整个马格里布（指北非，包括摩洛哥、阿尔及利亚和突尼斯三国的地区）不安全的因素。”
    备忘录指出，北大西洋公约组织成员国“给予法国的大量物资和外交支持，已经肯定地把北大西洋公约组织列入殖民主义公约的行列”。
    备忘录又说，北大西洋公约组织成员国“继续用一切手段供养阿尔及利亚战争，它们便这样和亚非各国人民的同情自行疏远。亚非各国人民愈来愈相信，所谓自由世界正在尽一切可能来阻止他们自由和独立的胜利。”备忘录说，阿尔及利亚共和国临时政府从这些事实中吸取了一切教训。
    备忘录再次严厉谴责法国政府强行把阿尔及利亚纳入北大西洋公约地区之内，以及利用它在摩洛哥和突尼斯的基地“继续对阿尔及利亚人民进行侵略”。备忘录揭露说，法国利用在突尼斯的比塞大海空基地是一个突出的例子。法国在阿尔及利亚使用的有些美国飞机是在摩洛哥修理的，而这些美制飞机曾在轰炸突尼斯的村庄时，炸死了正从学校出来的儿童。
