Let the Three Red Banners Fly in the Cinema
—Excerpts from the Report at the Second Member Representative Assembly of the Chinese Film Workers Association on July 30, 1960 	Xia Yan
	As the Third National Congress of Literary and Art Workers is convened here, we are crossing the first spring of the 1960s. Here, we will naturally think of the changes that have taken place in the Chinese film industry in the past ten years and the new situation at present.
	In the 1950s, especially in the two years since the Great Leap Forward, China's film industry has achieved extremely remarkable achievements under the correct leadership of the Party. Before the Great Leap Forward in 1957, China had ten film studios (including six feature film studios) and nineteen photography studios. By the end of 1959, the country had developed to thirty-three film studios (including eleven feature film studios) and twenty-seven feature film photography studios. In 1959, we produced eighty-two feature films, nineteen feature-length documentaries, one thousand one hundred and forty-eight newsreels, eighty-six science education films, and sixteen animated films. These films have made significant progress in ideology, art, and technology. In terms of screening units, there were only more than 600 screening units nationwide in 1949. By the end of 1959, the number of screening units had increased to more than 14,500. Due to the development of screening units, the people's opportunities to watch movies have greatly increased. By the end of 1959, the annual audience had reached 4.15 billion. By 1959, China had exported 297 feature films and 631 newsreels, science education, and animated films to foreign countries. We have established distribution and screening relationships with eighty countries and regions. Chinese films are warmly welcomed by a wide audience in Southeast Asia, West Asia, Africa, and Latin America.
	Chinese cinema is undergoing an extremely profound socialist transformation. Under the leadership of the Party Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong, and after repeated struggles, Chinese cinema has embarked on a correct and healthy road. This is a road that opposes imperialism and the bourgeoisie. This is a road where films serve the workers, peasants, and soldiers, serve the socialist cause, and film workers integrate with the working people. This is a road of "letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend" that combines consistency in political direction and diversity in artistic style.
	Because we have come through such a road, and because our team is loyal to the cause of proletarian revolution, the theme, ideology, and creative methods of Chinese film art, and its unique and highly combative style, have naturally formed.
	As an integral part of the proletarian revolutionary cause, Chinese film art has achieved relatively significant achievements in the following aspects.
	Reflecting the History of the Chinese People's Struggle
	Creating Heroic Images in Revolutionary Struggle
	Chinese cinema strives to correctly reflect and express the struggles and history of the Chinese people in various revolutionary stages, that is, to use the viewpoint of historical materialism, combined with China's revolutionary practice, using class analysis, focusing on depicting and portraying social changes after the invasion of China by imperialism, through specific figures, events, and the lives, aspirations and struggles of the people, to "prove that the Chinese people cannot tolerate the rule of dark forces, and they always use revolutionary means to overthrow and transform this rule." (Mao Zedong: "The Chinese Revolution and the Chinese Communist Party")
	We all clearly remember that in 1951, not long after the founding of New China, Comrade Mao Zedong personally led the criticism of the film "The Life of Wu Xun." He instructed us: The law of historical development always uses class struggle to overthrow the reactionary rulers who should be overthrown, and must never deny the class struggle of the oppressed people to surrender to the rulers like Wu Xun. He called on filmmakers to study the history of more than 100 years since the Opium War of 1840, to study what new socio-economic forms, new class forces, new figures, and new ideas have emerged in China to fight against the old socio-economic forms and their superstructure, and then decide what should be praised or eulogized, and what should not be praised or eulogized but should be opposed. After ten years, we have increasingly deeply realized that it was precisely because of this fierce ideological struggle at that time that Chinese cinema laid a solid foundation for reflecting the history of the Chinese revolution with historical materialism and firm class policies. We produced "Lin Zexu" and "Song Jingshi" of the old democratic revolution period, and we produced "Cuigang Red Flag," "The Storm," "Nie Er," and "Song of Youth" of the new democratic revolution period. We produced more excellent films during the Anti-Japanese War, the Liberation War, and the War to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea, such as "The White-Haired Girl," "Steel Warrior," "Sons and Daughters of China," "Dong Cunrui," "Daughter of the Party," "The Hui People's Detachment," "Youth in the Flames of War," "Shangganling," "Jin Yuji" and other excellent works. In "Lin Zexu," we praised the protagonist's patriotism and his anti-British deeds, but we did not depict this patriotic and enlightened heroic figure in isolation, but also focused on depicting the spontaneous demands and strength of the masses of people who could not bear the oppression of foreign enemies and longed to change the status quo. Therefore, in the film, figures like Kuang Dongshan, Mai Kuansao, and thousands of unknown "Pingying Tuan" masses—these images representing the anti-imperialist masses of people who can never be conquered and extinguished—are very vividly expressed. In "Song Jingshi," we portrayed a peasant leader who was diametrically opposed to the "Spirit of Wu Xun." We praised his spirit of resistance and portrayed his class hatred that was incompatible with the landlord class. However, we did not anti-historically write him as a conscious class fighter, but also appropriately pointed out his social and historical limitations. "Song Jingshi" is an unsuccessful and tragic epic of the Chinese peasant revolution, but the characteristic of this film is that Song Jingshi's failure does not give the audience a feeling of frustration and despair, but on the contrary, it makes people clearly see that the ruling class is already crumbling, and the underground fire of the peasant revolution is burning more and more vigorously. The struggles of Lin Zexu and Song Jingshi both ended in failure, but these two films similarly achieved the goal of inspiring the people with revolutionary spirit. Through typical figures and events, the film makes people clearly realize that sharp social contradictions are forcing the masses of people to use revolutionary means to achieve the goal of overthrowing and transforming the old society. This is the truth of art, and this is also the truth of history.
	Comparing Lin Zexu and Song Jingshi, we can feel a completely different new ideological emotion, new moral character, and new form of struggle from figures such as Lin Xiangqian, Shi Yang, Nie Er, and Lin Daojing. They experienced the stage of the New Democratic Revolution, and they were led by the Chinese proletariat who had newly ascended the stage of history. The Chinese people's liberation struggle has become an integral part of the world proletarian revolution. In this way, the glorious, great, and correct Communist Party of China naturally appeared on the screen through their lives and struggles. The leadership of the Party has become a brilliant red line running through these excellent films. The theme of these films is anti-imperialist struggle, but the protagonists of "The Storm," "Nie Er," and "Song of Youth" all take the great October Revolution as their example, and they already have a clear ideal of building a socialist motherland. From spontaneous struggle to conscious revolution, from individual resistance to collective, organized, and led struggle, from patriotism to proletarian internationalism... In these films, the general line of the Party during the democratic revolution period—led by the proletariat, the masses of the people opposing imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism—is reflected very prominently.
	The revolutionary and combative nature of Chinese films is particularly manifested in the fact that we have produced a large number of films reflecting armed struggle. By the end of 1959, in the past ten years, we had produced a total of 356 art films, of which more than 70, or about one-fifth of the total output, depicted armed struggle and military life. These films have been warmly welcomed by the people. Some Western bourgeois film critics and revisionists are not satisfied with these films depicting war. When the rightists attacked in 1957, they also used the fact that there were too many war films as an excuse to attack us. However, contrary to the opinions of these people, we believe that in order to correctly reflect the Chinese revolution, it is necessary to depict armed struggle. Failure to do so would not conform to the law of historical development in China. From 1927 until the victory of the whole country, we carried out twenty-two years of continuous revolutionary war. Before that, starting from the bourgeois revolution of 1911, there were also fifteen years of war. There were revolutionary wars and warlord melee under the instigation of imperialism. If we count from 1911 to the War to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea, China can be said to have carried out forty years of continuous warfare. On the one hand, it can be said that forty years of continuous armed struggle is a rare event in the history of world national liberation. On the other hand, under the leadership of Comrade Mao Zedong, it was precisely from this long-term armed struggle that the Chinese people raised their awareness, accumulated experience, and learned the art of struggle to defeat the fierce imperialism and its servants. As Comrade Liu Shaoqi said: "The revolutionary war carried out by the Chinese Communist Party relying on the rural revolutionary base areas, the land reform and economic and cultural construction carried out in the rural revolutionary base areas, was actually a long-term, repeated and great exercise to prepare for the national victory. In these exercises, the masses were educated, the army was trained, revolutionary forces were accumulated, cadres were cultivated, and the leadership of the Party gained rich experience in all aspects." Therefore, it is the responsibility of Chinese filmmakers to reflect these characteristics through film art.
	Should we make war films, and how should we make war films? On this issue, there is a clear and irreconcilable difference between us and bourgeois pacifists and revisionists. Bourgeois pacifists obliterate the essential difference between revolutionary war and counter-revolutionary war, and "oppose all wars" in general and without principle. Revisionists—and some people who are confused by certain new historical phenomena and do not understand them clearly—under the pretext of "loving peace and opposing war," similarly do not distinguish the nature of war, and depict just revolutionary wars as very dark and tragic, and write just wars for defending the motherland and resisting aggression as things that destroy personal happiness and should be cursed. On this issue, Chinese cinema follows a Marxist-Leninist principle. Lenin said: "We Marxists differ from both pacifists and anarchists in that we deem it necessary to study each war historically (from the standpoint of Marx's dialectical materialism). In history there have always been wars which, despite all the horrors, atrocities, distress and suffering inevitably connected with all wars, were progressive, i.e., served to develop humanity, helping to destroy most harmful and reactionary institutions (e.g., autocracy or serfdom) and the most barbarous despotisms in Europe (Turkish and Russian). That is why the historical features of the present war must be studied." (Lenin: "Socialism and War")
	The Chinese people are known to the world for their love of peace, but the Chinese people have been forced to engage in forty years of continuous warfare. The Chinese people have deeply experienced the disasters, atrocities, calamities, and suffering brought about by war. It is precisely because we have deeply suffered from the disasters of war that we have accumulated and summarized the experience of negotiating and struggling with all reactionaries for a long time, so we can find a correct way out from long-term suffering. That is, peace cannot be obtained by waiting, praying, and surrendering. To have peace, we must go through struggle. When imperialists impose war on us, we must unite and rise up, and use revolutionary war to eliminate counter-revolutionary war.
	Therefore, many of our war films have a common characteristic: we love peace, but we are not afraid of war; we must resolutely oppose unjust and counter-revolutionary wars, but we must unreservedly eulogize just and revolutionary wars.
	Our war-themed films truthfully reflect the war disasters imposed on the Chinese people by imperialism. We also depict the suffering and misfortune suffered by the masses of the people in the war. However, the main thing to be reflected in our war films is the people who have stood up strongly after being tempered and tested by the war and their strong will to "carry the revolution through to the end." They are ordinary workers, peasants, young women, old men, and "little devils" who failed to join the army and became orderlies... They are all ordinary, but they have all grown up in the flames of war and finally become fearless fighters with class consciousness. Closing our eyes, we can all recall many distinctive heroic images: Hu Xiuzhi in "Sons and Daughters of China," Liu Haiquan in "Steel Warrior," Little Ma in "Crossing the River Reconnaissance," Fu Ruohua in "Nandao Fengyun," Zhi Zhenbiao and Dong Cunrui in "Dong Cunrui," Zhang Zhongfa and Wang Lan in "Shangganling," Jin Yuji in "Jin Yuji," Gao Shan in "Youth in the Flames of War"... They are all ordinary working people, but they were not intimidated by enemies ten times or a hundred times stronger than them. They did not retreat, did not feel sentimental, and not only did they not bow their heads in front of the enemy, but they did not even shed tears when they were tortured the most severely. They did not consider their personal safety and happiness. What they considered was only the lofty ideal of building a new China. In our war films, there are many scenes of sending sons or husbands to join the army, but the tone of these scenes is inspiring mutual encouragement and support, and not using sentimental brushstrokes to depress the people's will to struggle. Our war films also depict many heroes who have sacrificed, but their heroic sacrifices are "heavier than Mount Tai" and do not make people feel sentimental and desperate. Look at the eternally exciting scene in "Dong Cunrui." When Dong Cunrui picked up the explosives pack and rushed towards the enemy's position, his last words were: "For the new China, advance!" Dong Cunrui sacrificed, and Zhi Zhenbiao and his comrades advanced, and the bunker was blown up. The audience was inspired by the hero's lofty spirit of self-sacrifice.
	Reflecting the New Life of the Socialist Construction Era  Creating New Heroes of the Socialist Construction Era
	Chinese cinema strives to quickly reflect the new era, the new society—especially the new people and new things, new heroes, and their new thoughts and feelings, new moral qualities in the period of socialist revolution and socialist construction, and to promote socialist and communist ideas through these. Over the past ten years, films with new people and new things as their themes have accounted for a large proportion of the art films we have produced. After the Great Leap Forward in 1958, this characteristic became more prominent. For example, in the two years 1958 and 1959, we produced a total of 185 feature-length art films, of which 156 reflected the socialist revolution and socialist construction, reflecting the modern people's lives, accounting for 84% of the total. Among these 156 films, 100 depicted the lives of workers, peasants, and soldiers, accounting for 64% of the total. This is the result of our filmmakers adhering to the principle of serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers, and it should also be said that this is a proud and valuable tradition of Chinese cinema.
	In the past, in today's imperialist and capitalist countries, the thoughts, feelings, lives, and even the images of workers and peasants could not be correctly and truthfully reflected on the screen. They were either erased or distorted, either written as lowly and pitiful, or written as stupid and ridiculous. But today, in the new China of the new era, the entire position has been reversed. We regard shaping and eulogizing the heroic figures of our own class as the most important political task. We wholeheartedly eulogize the laboring masses who create the world. We let the workers and peasants who were insulted and trampled on in the past become the glorious protagonists in the films. On the contrary, those imperialists, big capitalists, and big landlords who were invincible in Western countries' films have become despicable and shameful objects on our screen. It is an unshakable Marxist-Leninist principle that proletarian cinema must depict and eulogize new heroic figures, their new ideas, and new styles. Lenin once said: "It is not secondary, but primarily important to stimulate our ideas in the form of touching films that reflect life segments and are permeated with communist ideas. This is important not only because these films should praise good, increasingly developing and encouraging things throughout the country, but also because these films should lash out at things in our lives or in the lives of alien classes and in foreign life that should be lashed out." That is to say, on the one hand, we must use the actions of these positive characters to arouse the enthusiasm of the working people's pride and joy, so that they can move forward courageously with full confidence. At the same time, we must use sufficiently strong forces to expose and lash out at old things and old ideas, thereby educating people to hate the past, leave the past, and break with the old system, old ideas, and old habits. On this issue, we also have principled differences with Zhong Dianfei and other rightists and modern revisionists. We want to guide the people to look forward, they want to guide the people to look backward, we want to use film art to promote the more rapid growth of new things, and they want film art to consolidate the old things that "should be lashed out."
	Any era, any class, will consciously or unconsciously create positive characters of their own class—their ideal heroes—in their own literary and artistic works. Creating proletarian heroic figures is an important task of proletarian literature and art, so this requirement was put forward at the Second National Congress of Literary and Art Workers seven years ago. But at that time, this call was resisted by revisionists. They fundamentally denied that there were heroic figures in real society, so they believed that the new people, new things, and new heroic figures that appeared in our films were not "real" and were all "formulaic" and "conceptual." They one-sidedly emphasized that positive characters also have shortcomings. They believed that only writing about "the hero's five minutes of hesitation before sacrificing" could be considered "real" and in line with "human nature." They closed their eyes and were unwilling to look at the fiery class struggle and selfless construction labor. They believed that only those private trivial matters, low-level taste love disputes, and things sufficient to expose the defects and weaknesses in personality and morality could be considered "real art." Of course, in our revolution and construction cause, we will always encounter some difficulties and setbacks, and people will always have some shortcomings and errors more or less. In complex social life, there will inevitably be some "dark" things. Our literature and art should never avoid difficulties or ignore negative things. We also oppose diluting the contradictions and struggles in life and writing complex social phenomena and character into stereotypical and simplified things. However, Marxists are the most sober revolutionary realists, and at the same time, they are the most idealistic revolutionary idealists. On the one hand, we must correctly understand and reflect objective reality. On the other hand, we must attach great importance to the subjective initiative of the masses of the people and the role and significance of the scientific foresight of advanced ideas. Therefore, on the issue of "writing reality" and so-called "realism," we have irreconcilable principled differences with modern revisionists. Proletarian art should be the greatest and most noble art in human history. It stands the highest and sees the farthest. It has the most lofty ideals. It has the purpose of educating the people with socialist and communist spirit, so the authenticity of proletarian art must be combined with revolutionary tendencies. Twenty years ago, the great Soviet writer Gorky put forward the slogan of socialist realism, which was supported by revolutionary writers around the world, and modern revisionists opposed socialist realism, mainly opposing its revolutionary tendency to educate the people with socialist spirit, and fundamentally denying the Marxist epistemology of depicting reality from revolutionary development. They equated revolutionary realism with naturalism. They could not see or did not want to see the bright phenomena that dominate social life in this great era. They were even more unwilling to express the heroic figures of this heroic era—that is, "typical characters in typical environments" in the period of great social change. They tried their best to find the dark side of social life. They tried their best to use dark tones to describe the bright and splendid life of the new society. They did not describe those dark things as blemishes left over from the old society that were gradually being eliminated, but magnified them into the entire phenomenon or the main phenomenon of our new society. Why is this? To put it bluntly, this is just that their thoughts and feelings conflict with the new social system, and they stubbornly want to slander the new society through their works.
	Under the leadership of the Party, we have carried out repeated struggles with various bourgeois literary and artistic ideas and modern revisionist ideas. Especially after the rectification and anti-rightist struggles in 1957, we dealt a fatal blow to bourgeois reactionary ideas and opened up a broad road for the development of proletarian film art. In 1958, it can be said that the face of Chinese cinema underwent an epoch-making change. A large number of filmmakers threw themselves into the tide of the Great Leap Forward and went deep into the workers and peasants. Their attitudes towards the Party and the laboring masses changed, and they developed a closer relationship with the Party and the laboring masses. The three red banners of the general line, the Great Leap Forward, and the people's commune were reflected in our screen in a timely manner. A large number of new proletarian heroes—positive characters with labor spirit, fighting spirit, collective spirit, and upward spirit—emerged in our film art.
	Last October, in order to present gifts to celebrate the tenth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, we presented 38 excellent films of various styles. These films most vividly showed the above-mentioned characteristics of Chinese cinema. We are all very familiar with the titles of these excellent films, and we can also vividly recall the heroic figures in these films that cannot be forgotten for a long time. Because these films not only truthfully reflected the new people and new things with communist style in my country's socialist construction and daily life, but also vividly portrayed positive characters of various different personalities. Zhan Changhe in "Old Soldier's New Story," Gao Zhanwu and Kong Shuzhen in "Young People in Our Village," Fang Qun in "Spring is All Over the World," Zhang Min in "Sea Eagle," and Zhao Zhongkai and Zhang Qiliang in "Flying Over Natural Dangers"... Their origins are different, their experiences are different, and their personalities are different, but they have a common characteristic that can only be seen in our new society today; this is a firm and invincible confidence and heroic and fearless spirit in the revolutionary construction cause we are engaged in, the courage to think and do, the communist style that combines the revolutionary ideal of daring to despise all difficulties strategically and the pragmatic spirit of daring to attach importance to all difficulties tactically. This is also the "typical character in the typical environment" during the Great Leap Forward period of our socialist construction cause. New people, new moral concepts, and new relationships between people are born. "Old Soldier" Zhan Changhe is a typical figure of "forgetting the family for the country and forgetting the private for the public." He just ended twenty years of war life and ran to the Great Northern Wilderness to reclaim wasteland in one breath. However, when the audience saw him gazing at the tobacco pouch brought by his old wife and falling into contemplation for a moment, and when he gave his beloved pocket watch to Xiao Dongzi, people's hearts were deeply moved by his sincere class friendship. "Young People in Our Village" writes about a hot struggle to split mountains and seize water, but the film artist added a love episode with a strong touch to this story; because the weight of this episode is heavier and the dispute is more complicated, some viewers think that it is a bit of a case of the tail wagging the dog, but in the new society, these young people use completely new moral standards to deal with this issue, so the ending of this film is healthy, noble, and exciting. "Spring is All Over the World" is adapted from the true story of rescuing steel worker Qiu CaiKang. The theme itself is moving, but it is not an easy task to reflect the Party's strong leadership, embody the Party's class policy and mass line in medical work in this story, and to avoid being conceptual and flat. Through the efforts of the artists, this difficulty was overcome. They not only perfectly expressed the theme ideology, but also vividly shaped the moving image of Fang Qun, a grassroots leader of the Party, with flesh and blood. After these films were released, they were warmly welcomed by the people. Thousands of viewers organized forums, published film reviews, and wrote letters to the relevant film production units, expressing that they would use these heroic figures as their role models. A prominent example is "Five Golden Flowers." After this film was screened in the Dali Bai Autonomous Prefecture of Yunnan, the young people spontaneously launched a mass movement to "learn from Jin Hua and catch up with Jin Hua," which greatly promoted the production and construction of last winter and this spring.
	In order to more effectively serve the general line, the Great Leap Forward, and the people's commune, and to reflect the spirit and style of our laboring people in the Great Leap Forward more timely, more quickly, and more truthfully, since 1958, we have broken with convention and used the form of documentary art films to produce many new types of films based on real people and real events with certain artistic processing. This is a new attempt, but now it can be clearly seen that this bold attempt has not only opened up a new path for film creation, promoted the vast number of film workers to go deep into the fiery struggle of the masses of the people, but also truthfully recorded the amazing changes in our motherland during the Great Leap Forward, and through these real events recorded in a timely manner, carried out vivid and specific communist ideological education for the masses of the people. Due to lack of experience, some of the more than 40 documentary art films produced in 1958 were of poor artistic quality, but this new type of film with strong vitality produced works such as "Song on the Reservoir," "Huang Baomei," "By the 38th River," "On the Xin'an River," and "Evergreen Tree" with strong appeal and welcomed by a wide audience in its first year of birth. In the spring of 1960, Beijing Film Studio, in cooperation with many art groups, produced the documentary art film "For the Sixty-One Class Brothers" on the theme of the Pinglu migrant workers poisoning incident in a short period of less than a month. This film was warmly welcomed by the vast audience and distributed nearly 1,000 copies in two months, breaking the highest record for the number of copies distributed in the history of Chinese cinema.
	It should be pointed out that the above-mentioned characteristics of Chinese films with a strong revolutionary and combative nature and timely cooperation with political struggles are equally applicable to newsreels, science education films, animated films and other different types of films. Taking science education films as an example, we oppose the argument of "science for science's sake" and "spreading knowledge for the sake of spreading knowledge," and have always adhered to the policy that science education films must serve politics, serve production, and serve socialist construction. Our science education films use a materialist worldview to explain natural and social phenomena, and have produced "Peking Man," "Triumphant Songs of Life," "Man-Made Satellites in the Sky" and so on. At the same time, we have closely combined with production practice, promoted advanced technology, and introduced scientific and technological inventions and creations. We have produced "Large-Scale Wheat Harvest," "Freshwater Fish Farming," "Yangtze River Bridge" and so on to improve the cultural and scientific level of the people. Looking at some excellent documentary films in the past two years, such as "Ode to Heroes," "Heroes Conquer the Great Northern Wilderness," "Locking the Yellow Dragon," "Millions of Serfs Stand Up," "Celebrating Ten Years" and the recently made "Jubilant Tibet," "Asian Storm" and so on, it can be seen that Lenin's proposed "image-based political commentary" is very prominent in our newsreels.
	We emphasize the revolutionary and combative nature of films and adhere to the policy that films must cooperate with political struggles and serve the workers, peasants, and soldiers. At the same time, because we also adhere to the unity of consistency in political direction and diversity in artistic style, we strive to let a hundred flowers bloom in terms of themes, styles, and styles, and have produced many healthy and happy films that can enrich the cultural life of the people. Taking last year's National Day tribute films as an example, these films not only truthfully reflected the life and struggle of the Chinese people from the Opium War to the socialist construction Great Leap Forward, but also widely expressed the themes of workers, peasants, merchants, students, soldiers, fraternal ethnic groups, women, children, culture and education, science, health, sports, etc. Because the Party's policy of letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend has been implemented, the styles and styles of last year's tribute films are even more rich and colorful. We have not only produced films with serious themes such as "Across Mountains and Rivers" and "Storm," but also successfully produced works with comedic styles such as "Young People in Our Village," "Five Golden Flowers" and "Ten Thousand Purples and Thousands of Reds Are Always Spring."
	The Film Team Grows Up in Battle
	In our film front, the most gratifying thing in recent years, especially since the Great Leap Forward, should be the rapid growth of our film team and the changes in the thinking and spiritual outlook of film workers. The continuous growth of the film team and the continuous improvement of ideological and artistic levels will ensure that the future of our film industry will achieve more and better achievements.
	In the Great Leap Forward, our older generation of film workers has made great progress in politics, ideology, and artistic creation. In the era of the Great Leap Forward, many experienced film workers responded to the Party's call, actively participated in political struggles and mass movements, and contributed their talents and wisdom to the socialist film industry together with young film workers. On the one hand, many experienced and accomplished older generation screenwriters, directors, and actors joined the Party and made outstanding contributions in their work; on the other hand, in all aspects of screenwriting, directing, acting, photography, art, developing and printing... and scientific and technological research, a team of young film workers who are striving to be both red and expert is also growing and expanding rapidly. Since the Great Leap Forward, new people have emerged in the film team, which is a very gratifying phenomenon. We should cheer for the film industry to have excellent successors, and we should also feel gratified and proud that we have fulfilled our due responsibility in cultivating and helping the growth of the younger generation.
	The rapid growth and expansion of our film team and the improvement of the quality of our film art should be said to be the result of our adhering to the mass line in film work. Since the Great Leap Forward, we have actively developed the amateur literary and artistic activities of the people, promoted mass creation, and encouraged professional film workers to cooperate with workers and peasants. This has made collective creation an important form of our literary and artistic creation activities. This has found the correct path for the nationalization and massization of our film art.
	Tasks of Filmmakers in the Future
	Under the leadership of the Party and under the brilliant light of Mao Zedong Thought and the general line, China's film industry has made great achievements in a short period of time. We must fully affirm this achievement, and at the same time, we must work hard and strive for the upstream, so that our film industry can rapidly achieve universal development and our film art can climb to the peak of world film art more quickly. Under the current excellent situation, the glorious and arduous tasks in front of all filmmakers are: to develop our film production, screening, distribution, scientific research and other aspects of our business at a faster rate than in the previous two years, and to improve the ideological and artistic level of our art films, newsreels, science education films, and animated films. Last November, at the reception celebrating the New Film Exhibition Month, Comrade Zhou Enlai pointed out: "Although we have made many achievements in film work, we must always see if there are any shortcomings. I think no matter which aspect, feature films, documentaries, newsreels, science education films, or animated films, we can definitely find many shortcomings. We should listen to the criticisms of the literary and art circles, the film circles, and the audience, the criticisms of fraternal countries, and accept their many good opinions to make our film work better." This is the requirement put forward by the Party and the masses of the people to us, and this is also our glorious responsibility that we cannot shirk.
	In order to more quickly develop our film industry and improve the level of our film art, we must have lofty aspirations, set great ambitions, and do our best to complete the following most important tasks.
	First, our task is: to hold high the red banner of Mao Zedong Thought in film work, and launch a mass movement to study Mao Zedong's works and apply Mao Zedong Thought. All film workers must diligently and systematically study Comrade Mao Zedong's works, follow Comrade Mao Zedong's instructions, attach importance to labor, attach importance to practice, contact the masses, resolutely struggle with bourgeois ideology and revisionist ideology, gradually establish a proletarian and communist worldview, and transform themselves into film workers who are truly loyal to the proletarian revolutionary cause. Only in this way can we implement the policy of film serving politics and serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers, and can we give the fullest play to our talents and wisdom and make the best contributions to socialist construction.
	Second, our task is: under the premise of politics taking command and art serving politics, we must work hard to study, delve into skills, and vigorously improve the artistic and technical level of Chinese films. Comrade Mao Zedong instructed us that revolutionary political content should be combined with the most perfect artistic form, and at the same time pointed out: "Different forms and styles in art can develop freely." On the one hand, we must strive to study and gradually master the creative principle of combining revolutionary realism and revolutionary romanticism so that our film art can be more suitable for expressing the heroic figures of the new era. At the same time, we must resolutely implement the policy of letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend so that various different forms and styles of art can develop freely. Our films must not only have the content that can best express the Chinese national spirit, but also have the expression forms that are most easily accepted and loved by the Chinese laboring people. First of all, we must express the national character and national spirit of the Chinese people through class viewpoints and the characteristics of the times. At the same time, we must learn from the workers, peasants, and soldiers, learn from our traditional art, strive to adapt to the appreciation habits of the workers and peasants, and create nationalized and mass-oriented film art.
	Third, our task is: to adopt various methods, cultivate new forces more quickly, better, and more economically, and rapidly expand our film team. Comrade Zhou Enlai pointed out: "Many new and good films have been selected excellent actors from the cultural and art troupes and from amateur literary and art enthusiasts. In the future, we can also absorb excellent photographers from photography enthusiasts, excellent directors from drama enthusiasts, and excellent screenwriters and editors from literary enthusiasts and propaganda workers. We must expand the current film team and the organization of the film liaison association." We must use new forces boldly, promote them boldly, strengthen education, and provide specific help. The older generation of film workers must take cultivating, educating, and expanding the film team as their own responsibility. We must link up with schools, production departments, and scientific research institutions, strengthen communist cooperation, and conquer the cutting edge of film science and technology as soon as possible. We must strive to study Marxist aesthetics, strengthen film criticism, and at the same time, we must carry out mass film review activities among workers, peasants, troops, government cadres, and young people to strengthen our film theory team.
	Comrades, as we are holding the Third National Congress of Literary and Art Workers here, we are in the midst of the greatest socialist revolution and socialist construction moment in my country's history. The international situation is very good, and the domestic situation is even better. Under the wise leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Comrade Mao Zedong, the Chinese people are in high spirits and high morale. They are striving with high enthusiasm and creative labor to complete and overfulfill the 1960 national economic plan and to realize the National Agricultural Development Program ahead of schedule. With the tide of this surging socialist construction, all cities and vast rural areas in our country are carrying out a vigorous technological revolution and

    让三面红旗在银幕上迎风招展
    ——1960年7月30日在中国电影工作者协会第二次会员代表大会上的报告摘要	夏衍
    当第三次文代大会在这里召开的时候，我们正跨过了二十世纪六十年代的第一个春天。在此，我们会很自然地想起过去十年间我国电影界所发生的变化，和当前的新的形势。
    在五十年代里，特别在大跃进以来的两年里，我国电影事业在党的正确领导下，取得了极其显著的成就。在大跃进以前的1957年，我国共有十个电影制片厂（其中故事片厂六个）、摄影场十九座，到1959年底，全国发展到了三十三个电影制片厂（其中故事片厂十一个），故事片的摄影场二十七座。1959年，我们摄制了八十二部故事片、十九部长纪录片、一千一百四十八本新闻纪录片、八十六部科学教育片、十六部美术片。这些影片，不论在思想上、艺术上、技术上，都有了显著的进步。从放映单位来说，1949年全国只有六百多个放映单位，到1959年底，放映单位已经发展到一万四千五百多个。由于放映单位的发展，人民群众看电影的机会有了巨大的发展，至1959年底，全年观众已达四十一亿五千万人次。到1959年，我国向国外输出了长故事片二百九十七部次，新闻纪录、科教、美术片六百三十一部次，我们已经和八十个国家和地区建立了发行放映关系。我国电影在东南亚、西亚、非洲、拉丁美洲都受到广大观众的很热烈的欢迎。
    中国电影正经历着一场极其深刻的社会主义变革。在党中央和毛泽东同志的领导下，经过反复的斗争，中国电影已经走上了一条正确、健康的道路。这是一条反对帝国主义、反对资产阶级的道路，这是一条电影为工农兵服务、为社会主义事业服务，电影工作者与劳动人民相结合的道路，这是一条政治方向上的一致性和艺术风格上的多样性相结合的百花齐放、百家争鸣的道路。
    由于我们走过来的是这样一条道路，由于我们这支队伍是忠于无产阶级革命事业的队伍，这就很自然地形成了中国电影艺术的主题思想、创作方法，和它独特的具有强烈战斗性的风格。
    作为无产阶级革命事业的一个组成部分，中国的电影艺术在以下这几方面取得了比较显著的成绩。
    反映中国人民斗争的历史
    创造革命斗争中的英雄形象
    中国电影力求正确地反映和表现中国人民在各个不同革命阶段的斗争和历史，就是说，用历史唯物主义的观点，结合中国的革命实际，运用阶级分析，着重地描写和刻划帝国主义侵入中国以后的社会变化，通过具体的人物、事件和人民群众的生活、愿望与斗争，来“证明中国人民是不能忍受黑暗势力的统治的，他们每次都用革命的手段达到推翻和改造这种统治的目的。”（毛泽东：《中国革命和中国共产党》）
    我们每个人都清楚地记得，在新中国成立之后不久的1951年，毛泽东同志亲自领导了对电影《武训传》的批判。他指示我们：历史发展的规律总是以阶级斗争去推翻应当推翻的反动统治者，而决不能像武训那样地否定被压迫人民的阶级斗争而去向统治者投降。他号召电影工作者研究自从1840年鸦片战争以来的一百多年的历史，研究中国发生了一些什么向着旧的社会经济形态及其上层建筑作斗争的新的社会经济形态，新的阶级力量，新的人物和新的思想，然后决定什么东西应当称赞或者歌颂，什么东西不应当称赞歌颂而应当反对。经过了十年的时间，我们越来越深刻地体会到，正是由于在那个时候就进行了这一场剧烈的思想斗争，中国电影才奠定了用历史唯物主义和坚定的阶级政策来反映中国革命历史的坚实的基础。我们摄制了旧民主主义革命时期的《林则徐》、《宋景诗》，我们摄制了新民主主义革命时期的《翠岗红旗》、《风暴》、《聂耳》、《青春之歌》，我们摄制了更多的抗日战争时期、解放战争时期和抗美援朝时期的优秀影片如《白毛女》、《钢铁战士》、《中华女儿》、《董存瑞》、《党的女儿》、《回民支队》、《战火中的青春》、《上甘岭》、《金玉姬》等优秀作品。在《林则徐》里我们赞扬了主人公的爱国主义精神和他的抗英事迹，但是我们并没有孤立地去描写这一位爱国的开明的英雄人物，而同时也着重地描写了不堪外敌欺压而渴望改变现状的那种人民群众的自发的要求和力量，因此在影片里，像邝东山、麦宽嫂和千千万万不知名的“平英团”的群众，——这些代表着永远不能被征服和扑灭的反帝国主义人民群众的形象，是表现得很鲜明的。在《宋景诗》里，我们描写了一个与“武训精神”针锋相对的农民领袖，我们赞扬了他的反抗精神，刻划了他的那种和地主阶级不共戴天的阶级仇恨，但是我们并没有反历史主义地把他写成一个自觉的阶级斗士，而同时也恰如其分地指出了他的社会和历史的条件限制。《宋景诗》是我国农民革命的一首没有成功的悲壮的史诗，但是这部电影的特点是宋景诗的失败并没有给观众以沮丧和绝望的感觉，而相反地使人们清楚地看到，那个统治阶级已经摇摇欲坠，农民革命的地下火正在越燃越旺。林则徐和宋景诗的斗争，都是以失败来终结的，但是这两部影片同样地达到一个用革命精神鼓舞人民的目的。影片通过典型的人物和事件，让人们明确地认识到，尖锐的社会矛盾正迫使着人民群众不能不用革命的手段来达到推翻和改造旧社会的目的。这是艺术的真实，这也正是历史的真实。
    和林则徐、宋景诗比较一下，我们可以在林祥谦、施洋、聂耳、林道静这些人物身上感到一种截然不同的新的思想感情、新的道德品质和新的斗争形式。他们经历的是新民主主义革命阶段，领导他们的是新登上历史舞台的中国无产阶级，中国人民的解放斗争已经成为世界无产阶级革命的一个组成部分，这样，就很自然地通过他们的生活斗争，光荣、伟大、正确的中国共产党在银幕上出现了。党的领导成了贯彻着这些优秀影片的一根灿烂的红线。这些影片的主题都是反帝斗争，但是，《风暴》、《聂耳》、《青春之歌》的主人公们都是以伟大的十月革命作为自己的榜样，他们都已经有了一个明确的要建设社会主义祖国的理想。从自发的斗争到自觉的革命，从个人的反抗到集体的、有组织、有领导的斗争，从爱国主义到无产阶级的国际主义，……在这些影片中，无产阶级领导的、人民大众的反对帝国主义、反对封建主义、反对官僚资本主义这一条民主革命时期的党的总路线，是反映得非常突出的。
    中国电影的革命性、战斗性，特别表现在我们摄制了大量反映武装斗争的影片。到1959年底，十年以来，我们一共制作了三百五十六部艺术片，其中，描写武装斗争和部队生活的共七十余部，约占总产量的五分之一，这些影片在人民群众中都获得了十分热烈的欢迎。某些西方资产阶级影评家和修正主义者不满意这些描写战争的影片，1957年右派进攻的时候也把战争片太多作为由头向我们进行攻击。可是和这些人的意见相反，我们却认为要正确地反映中国革命，就必然地要描写武装斗争，不这样做就不合乎中国历史发展的规律。从1927年起一直到全国胜利，我们进行了二十二年连续不断的革命战争，在这之前，从1911年的资产阶级革命开始，还有十五年的战争，这里有革命战争，也有帝国主义指使下的军阀混战。假如从1911年算起，一直到抗美援朝战争，中国可以说是连续进行了四十年的战争。一方面说，连续不断地进行了四十年武装斗争是世界民族解放史上的一个罕有的事例，另一方面说，在毛泽东同志的领导下，中国人民也正是从这一长期的武装斗争中提高了觉悟，积累了经验，学会了战胜凶恶的帝国主义及其仆从的斗争艺术。正如刘少奇同志所说：“中国共产党依靠农村革命根据地进行的革命战争，在农村革命根据地进行的土地改革和经济文化建设，实际上是为准备全国胜利而进行的长期反复的伟大的演习。在这些演习中，教育了群众，锻炼了军队，积蓄了革命力量，培养了干部，并且使党的领导在各方面都取得了丰富经验。”所以通过电影艺术来反映这些特点，也正是中国电影工作者的责任。
    要不要拍战争片，和怎样拍战争片？在这个问题上我们和资产阶级和平主义者与修正主义者之间有明显的、不可调和的分歧。资产阶级和平主义者抹杀了革命战争与反革命战争的本质区别，笼统地、无原则地“反对一切战争”，修正主义者——和一些对某些历史的新现象感到迷惑而认识不清楚的人，则在“爱好和平，反对战争”的借口下，同样地不区别战争的性质，把正义的革命战争也描写得十分阴暗凄惨，把为了捍卫祖国、反抗侵略而进行的正义战争，也写成为破坏个人幸福的、应该咀咒的事情。在这个问题上，中国电影遵循的是一条马克思列宁主义的原则。列宁说过：“我们马克思主义者既不同于和平主义者也不同于无政府主义者，我们认为必须历史地（根据马克思的辩证唯物主义观点）研究各个战争。历史上常常有这样的战争，它们虽然像一切战争一样不可避免地带来种种惨祸、暴行、灾难和痛苦，但是它们仍然是进步的战争，也就是说，它们促进了人类的发展，加速地破坏极端有害的和反动的制度（如专制制度或农奴制），破坏欧洲最野蛮的专制政体（土耳其的和俄国的）。因此，必须研究当前这一战争的历史特点。”（列宁：《社会主义与战争》）
    中国人民以爱好和平著称于世，但是中国人民却被迫着进行了连绵四十年之久的战争。对于战争带来的惨祸、暴行、灾难和痛苦，中国人民是体会得很深刻的，但是也正因为我们身受战争的灾害，体会很深，同时，也由于我们长期以来已经积累和总结了同一切反动派谈判的经验和斗争的经验，所以我们才能从长期的苦难中找到了一条正确的出路，这就是靠等待、祈求和屈服是不能得到和平的。要和平，就必须经过斗争，而当帝国主义者把战争强加在我们头上的时候，我们就必须团结奋起，用革命的战争来消灭反革命的战争。
    由于此，在我们摄制的许多战争片中，都有一种共同的特色，这就是：我们热爱和平，但是我们不怕战争；我们要坚决地反对非正义的反革命的战争，但是我们要无保留地歌颂正义的革命战争。
    我们的以战争为题材的影片真实地反映了帝国主义强加在中国人民头上的战争灾难，我们也描写了人民群众在战争中所遭受的痛苦和不幸，但是在我们的战争片中主要要反映的，却是那些经过战争的锻炼和考验而坚强地站起来了的人民和他们的那种“把革命进行到底”的强烈的意志。他们是普通的工人、农民、年轻的妇女、老汉、参军不合格而当了勤务员的“小鬼”……他们都很平凡，可是他们却都在战火的烈焰中成长起来，而终于成为有阶级觉悟的无畏的战士。一闭上眼，我们都能想起许多性格鲜明的英雄形象，《中华女儿》中的胡秀芝，《钢铁战士》中的刘海泉，《渡江侦察记》中的小马，《南岛风云》中的符若华，《董存瑞》中的郅振标、董存瑞，《上甘岭》中的张忠发、王兰，《金玉姬》中的金玉姬，《战火中的青春》中的高山……，他们都是普通的劳动人民，可是他们没有被十百倍强大于他们的敌人吓倒，他们没有退缩，没有感伤，不仅没有在敌人面前低头，他们甚至在被折磨得最厉害的时候也没有流过眼泪；他们毫不考虑到个人的安危和幸福，他们考虑的只是建立新中国的崇高的理想。在我们的战争片中，有许多送子或者送夫参军的场面，但这些场面的基调是振奋人心的相互激励和支持，而没有用感伤的笔调去沮丧人民群众的斗争意志；我们的战争片中，也描写了许多牺牲了的英雄，但是他们的壮烈成仁是“死有重于泰山”，而并不使人感到感伤和绝望。看看《董存瑞》中那个永远激动人心的场面吧，董存瑞拿起炸药包冲向敌阵的时候，他最后一句话是：“为了新中国，前进！”董存瑞牺牲了，郅振标和他的战友们前进了，碉堡炸破了。观众们为英雄的崇高的自我牺牲精神所鼓舞。
    反映社会主义建设时代的新生活  创造社会主义建设时代的新英雄
    中国电影力求迅速地反映新的时代、新的社会——特别是社会主义革命和社会主义建设时期的新人新事、新的英雄人物和这些人物的新的思想感情、新的道德品质，并通过这些来宣传社会主义、共产主义的思想。十多年来，在我们摄制的艺术片中，以新人新事为题材的影片占很大比例，1958年大跃进以后，这一特点表现得更为显著。举例来说，1958、1959这两年中，我们一共摄制了艺术长片一百八十五部，其中反映社会主义革命和社会主义建设，反映现代人民生活的计一百五十六部，占总数84％。在这一百五十六部影片中，表现工农兵生活的计一百部，占总数的64％。这是我们电影工作者坚持电影为工农兵服务这一方针的结果，也应该说，这是中国电影值得自豪的、可贵的传统。
    在过去，在今天的帝国主义、资本主义国家里，工人、农民的思想、感情、生活以至他们的形象，是不可能正确地、真实地反映在银幕上的。他们不是被抹杀，就是被歪曲，不是被写成卑下可怜，就是被写成愚蠢可笑。可是今天，在新时代的新中国，整个地位被翻过来了，我们把塑造和歌颂自己阶级的英雄人物作为最重要的政治任务，我们尽情地歌颂了创造世界的劳动群众，我们让过去被侮辱、被作践的工人、农民成为影片中的光辉的主角，而相反，在西方国家电影里不可一世的那些帝国主义者、大资本家、大地主……在我们银幕上却变成可鄙、可耻的对象了。无产阶级的电影一定要描写和歌颂新的英雄人物、他们的新的思想、新的风格，这是一个不可动摇的马克思列宁主义的原则。列宁曾经说过：“在反映生活片断并渗透着共产主义思想的动人的影片形式中，用艺术方法宣传我们的思想，不是比较次要的，而是更为重要的。其所以重要，不仅在于这些影片应该向全国表扬良好的、日益发展的、令人鼓舞的事物，而且在于这些影片应该鞭笞我们的或异己阶级底生活和外国生活中应该鞭笞的东西。”这就是说，我们一方面要通过这些正面人物的行为来激发起劳动人民的骄傲喜悦的热情，使他们满怀信心地奋勇地前进，同时我们也要以足够强大的力量来揭露和鞭笞旧事物、旧思想，借此来教育人们憎恨过去，离开过去，和旧制度、旧思想、旧习惯决裂。在这个问题上，我们和钟惦棐等右派分子与现代修正主义者也有着原则性的分歧。我们要引导人民向前看，他们要引导人民向后看，我们要用电影艺术来促进新生事物的更迅速地成长，而他们则要电影艺术去巩固那些“应该鞭笞”的旧的东西。
    任何一个时代，任何一个阶级，都会自觉或不自觉地在自己的文艺作品中创造出自己阶级的正面人物——他们理想中的英雄。创造无产阶级的英雄人物是无产阶级文学艺术的重要任务，所以在七年前，第二次文代大会上就提出了这个要求。可是在当时，这个号召受到修正主义者的抗拒。他们根本否认现实社会中有英雄人物，所以他们认为在我们电影中出现的新人新事、新的英雄人物都不“真实”，都是“公式化”、“概念化”的东西，他们片面地强调正面人物也有缺点，他们认为只有写“英雄人物在牺牲之前有五分钟的动摇”才算得上“真实”，才合乎“人情”。他们闭上眼睛不愿意看火热的阶级斗争和忘我的建设劳动，他们认为只要有描写那些私人琐事、低级趣味的恋爱纠纷，以及足以揭露性格和道德品质上的缺陷和弱点的东西，才算是“真实的艺术”。当然，在我们的革命和建设事业中总会遇到一些困难和挫折，人们或多或少地总会有些缺点和错误，复杂的社会生活中也难免还会有一些“阴暗”的东西，我们的文学艺术决不该回避困难，忽视消极事物，我们也反对冲淡生活中的矛盾和斗争，把复杂的社会现象和人物性格写成刻版的、简单化的东西。但是，马克思主义者是最清醒的革命现实主义者，而同时又是最富于理想的革命理想主义者，我们一方面要正确地认识和反映客观现实，另一方面又必须十分重视人民群众的主观能动性和先进思想的科学预见性的作用和意义。由于此，在“写真实”和所谓“现实主义”这个问题上，我们和现代修正主义者就有了不可调和的原则性的分歧。无产阶级的艺术应该是人类历史上最伟大、最高尚的艺术，它站得最高，看得最远，它有最崇高的理想，它有用社会主义、共产主义精神来教育人民的目的，所以无产阶级艺术的真实性必然地要和革命的倾向性相结合。二十年前，伟大的苏联作家高尔基提出了社会主义现实主义这个口号，得到了世界革命作家的拥护，而现代修正主义者反对社会主义现实主义，主要就是反对它的用社会主义精神教育人民的革命的倾向性，而且还根本否定了从革命发展中去描写现实的马克思主义的认识论。他们把革命的现实主义和自然主义等同起来，他们看不到或者不想看到今天这个伟大时代的社会生活中占主流地位的光明现象，他们更不愿去表现这个英雄时代的英雄人物，——也就是社会大变革时期的“典型环境中的典型性格”。他们竭力去寻求社会生活中的阴暗面，他们竭力想用阴暗的色调去描写光明灿烂的新社会的生活。他们不是把那些阴暗的东西当旧社会遗留下来的、正在逐渐消除的斑痕来描写，而是把它们夸大成为我们新社会的整个现象或主要现象。为什么要这样？说穿了，这不过是他们的思想感情和新的社会制度发生抵触，他们顽强地要通过作品来对新社会进行诽谤而已。
    在党的领导下，我们和各种资产阶级文艺思想、现代修正主义思想进行了反复的斗争，特别是经过了1957年的整风和反右派斗争，我们才给资产阶级反动思想以致命的打击，替无产阶级电影艺术开辟了一条广泛发展的道路。1958年，可以说，中国电影的面貌发生了划时期的变化。大批电影工作者投身到大跃进的浪潮，深入工农群众，他们对党、对劳动群众的态度发生了变化，对党、对劳动群众产生了更加亲近的感情，总路线、大跃进、人民公社这三面红旗在我们的银幕上得到了及时的反映，大批无产阶级的新的英雄人物——富有劳动精神、战斗精神、集体精神和向上精神的正面人物，在我们电影艺术中涌现出来了。
    去年10月，为了向建国十周年献礼，我们献映了各种不同样式的三十八部优秀影片。这些影片最生动地显示了中国电影的上述的这个特点。我们都能很熟悉地举出这些优秀电影的片名，我们也很熟悉地能记起这些影片中的久久不能使人忘却的英雄人物。因为这些影片不仅真实地反映了我国社会主义建设事业和日常生活中的、具有共产主义风格的新人新事，而且生动地刻划了各种不同个性的正面人物。《老兵新传》中的战长河，《我们村里的年轻人》中的高占武、孔淑贞，《春满人间》中的方群，《海鹰》中的张敏，以及《飞越天险》中的赵忠凯、张启良……他们的出身不同，经历不同，性格不同，但是他们身上却有一种共同的、只有在我们今天这个新社会中才能看到的时代特征；这就是对我们所从事的革命建设事业具有坚定必胜的信心和英勇无畏的气概，敢想敢做，敢于在战略上藐视一切困难而又能在战术上重视一切困难的革命理想与务实精神相结合的共产主义者的风格。这，也就是在我们这个社会主义建设事业大跃进时期的“典型环境中的典型性格”。新的人，新的道德观念，就产生了新的人与人之间的关系。“老兵”战长河是一个典型的“国尔忘家，公尔忘私”的人物，刚刚结束了二十年的战争生活，就一口气跑到北大荒去开荒了，可是，当观众看到他注视着老妻给他带来的烟袋而一瞬间陷于沉思的时候，当他把心爱的挂表赠送给小冬子的时候，人们的心却深深地给他的那种真挚的阶级友爱所打动了。《我们村里的年轻人》写的是一场热火朝天的劈山夺水斗争，可是电影艺术家却在这个故事里加上了一段笔触很浓的恋爱插曲；由于这个插曲的分量重了一些，纠纷又比较复杂，所以也有观众认为颇有一点喧宾夺主，可是在新社会里，这些青年们用全新的道德标准来对待这个问题，所以这部影片的结局是健康、高尚而使人感到兴奋的。《春满人间》取材于抢救钢铁工人丘财康的真实故事，题材本身是动人的，可是既要在这个故事中反映出党的坚强领导，体现出党在医疗工作上的阶级政策和群众路线，而又要不流于概念和平板，就是一个不很容易的课题。经过艺术家们的努力，这个困难被克服了。他们不仅完满地表达了主题思想，而且还鲜明地塑造了方群这样一个党的基层领导者的有血有肉的动人形象。这些影片公映之后，都获得了人民群众的热烈欢迎，成千上万的观众组织座谈，发表影评，并纷纷写信给有关制片单位，表示要以这些英雄人物作为自己的榜样。其中一个突出的例子是《五朵金花》，这部影片在云南大理白族自治州上映之后，青年们自发地掀起一个“学金花、赶金花”的群众运动，对去冬今春的生产建设起了很大的推进作用。
    为了更有效地为总路线、大跃进、人民公社服务，为了更及时、更迅速、更真实地反映出我国劳动人民在大跃进中的干劲和风格，1958年起，我们打破常规，用纪录性艺术片的形式摄制了许多以真人真事为基础而又作了一定艺术加工的新型影片。这是一种新的尝试，但是现在已经可以清楚地看到，这种大胆的尝试不仅给电影创作开辟了一条新的途径，推动了广大电影工作者深入人民群众的火热斗争，而且还真实地纪录了我们祖国在大跃进中的惊人变化，并通过这些及时地摄录下来的真实事迹，对人民群众进行了生动、具体的共产主义思想教育。由于经验不足，在1958年摄制的四十多部纪录性艺术片中，也有一部分艺术质量不高，但是有强大生命力的这种新型影片，在它诞生的第一年中，就产生了像《水库上的歌声》、《黄宝妹》、《三八河边》、《新安江上》、《常青树》等等具有强大感染力量而又受到广大观众欢迎的作品。1960年春，北京电影制片厂与许多艺术团体协作，在不足一个月的短时期内，摄成了以平陆民工中毒事件为题材的纪录性艺术片《为了六十一个阶级弟兄》，这部影片受到广大观众的热烈欢迎，在两个月内就发行了将近一千个拷贝，打破了我国电影史上发行拷贝量的最高纪录。
    应该指出，上面所说的这种中国电影的具有强烈的革命性、战斗性和及时地配合政治斗争的特点，同样地也适用于新闻纪录片、科学教育片、美术片等各种不同样式的片种。举科学教育片为例，我们反对“为科学而科学”、“为传播知识而传播知识”的论调，一贯坚持了科学教育片必须为政治服务、为生产服务、为社会主义建设服务的方针。我们的科学教育片用唯物主义世界观来解释自然现象和社会现象，摄制了《中国猿人》、《生命的凯歌》、《人造卫星上了天》等等，同时，我们又密切地结合生产实践，推广先进技术，介绍科学技术的发明创造，摄制了《小麦大面积丰收》、《淡水养鱼》、《长江大桥》等等，来提高人民群众的文化科学水平。再看一下两年来的一些优秀纪录影片，如《英雄赞》、《英雄战胜北大荒》、《锁住黄龙》、《百万农奴站起来》、《欢庆十年》以及最近制成的《欢腾的西藏》、《亚洲风暴》等等，同样地可以看到，列宁所提出的“形象化的政论”这一要求，在我们的新闻纪录片中是表现得很突出的。
    我们强调电影的革命性、战斗性，和坚持电影必须配合政治斗争和为工农兵服务的方针，但同时，由于我们也坚持政治方向上的一致性和艺术风格上的多样性的统一，所以我们在题材样式和风格上力求百花齐放，摄制了许多健康、愉快，可以丰富人民群众文化生活的影片。以去年国庆献礼片为例，这些影片不仅真实地反映了从鸦片战争到社会主义建设大跃进的各个历史时期中国人民的生活和斗争，而且广泛地表现了工、农、商、学、兵，兄弟民族、妇女、儿童，文教、科学、卫生、体育等各个方面的主题。由于贯彻了党的百花齐放、百家争鸣的方针，因此，去年献礼影片的样式、风格，也就更加丰富多彩了。我们既摄制了像《万水千山》、《风暴》那样主题严肃的影片，我们也成功地拍出了像《我们村里的年轻人》、《五朵金花》和《万紫千红总是春》这一类喜剧风格的作品。
    电影队伍在战斗中成长起来
    在我们电影战线上，近年以来，特别是大跃进以来最值得高兴的事情，应该是我们这支电影队伍的迅速成长，和电影工作者的思想、精神面貌的变化。电影队伍的不断壮大，思想、艺术水平的不断提高，这就保证了我们电影事业的未来，必将获得更多更好的成就。
    在大跃进中，我们老一辈的电影工作者不论在政治上、思想上、艺术创作上都有了巨大的进步。在大跃进的年代里，许多有经验的电影工作者响应党的号召，积极参加了政治斗争和群众运动，并和青年电影工作者一起，为社会主义的电影事业贡献出了他们的才能和智慧。一方面，许多有经验、有成就的、年长一辈的编剧、导演、演员参加了党的队伍，在工作中作出了卓越的贡献；另一方面，不论在编剧、导演、演员、摄影、美工、洗印……以及科学技术研究的各个方面，以又红又专为自己努力方向的青年电影工作者队伍也正在迅速地成长和壮大。大跃进以来，电影队伍中新人辈出，这是一种十分可喜的现象。我们应当为电影事业有了优秀的后继者而欢呼，我们也应当为我们在培养和帮助青年一代的成长中尽了一份应有的责任，而感到欣慰和骄傲。
    我们这支电影队伍的迅速成长和壮大，我们电影艺术质量的提高，应该说，这是我们坚持了在电影工作中必须贯彻执行群众路线的结果。大跃进以来，我们积极发展了人民群众的业余文艺活动，推动群众创作，鼓励专业电影工作者和工农群众合作。使集体创作成为我们文艺创作活动中的一种重要形式。这就为我们电影艺术的民族化、群众化找到了正确的道路。
      今后电影工作者的任务
    在党的领导下，在毛泽东思想和总路线的光辉照耀下，短时期内，我国电影事业已经取得了巨大的成就。我们要充分肯定这个成就，同时也还要鼓足干劲、力争上游，使我们的电影事业迅速地得到普遍的发展，使我们的电影艺术更快地攀登上世界电影艺术的高峰。在目前的大好形势下，摆在我们全体电影工作者前面的光荣而又艰巨的任务是：要用比前两年更快的速度，来发展我们制片、放映、发行、科学研究等等各方面的事业，来提高我们艺术片、新闻纪录片、科学教育片、美术片的思想、艺术水平。去年11月，在庆祝新片展览月的招待会上，周恩来同志指出：“尽管我们电影工作方面有了不少的成就，我们总还要看看是否还有缺点。我想不管那个方面，故事片也好，纪录片也好，新闻片也好，科教片也好，美术片也好，一定可以找出许多缺点来。我们应当听取文艺界的、电影界的、观众们的批评，兄弟国家对我们的批评，把他们许多好的意见接受过来，使我们的电影工作更好地前进。”这是党和人民群众对我们提出的要求，这也是我们无可旁贷的光荣的责任。
    为了更迅速地发展我们的电影事业和提高我们的电影艺术水平，我们必须树雄心，立大志，竭尽全力，去完成下述的几项最重要的任务。
    第一，我们的任务是：在电影工作中高举起毛泽东思想的红旗，开展一个学习毛泽东著作、运用毛泽东思想的群众运动。全体电影工作者必须努力地、系统地学习毛泽东同志的著作，遵循毛泽东同志的指示，重视劳动，重视实践，联系群众，和资产阶级思想、修正主义思想作坚决斗争，逐步树立起无产阶级的、共产主义的世界观，把自己改造成为真正忠诚于无产阶级革命事业的电影工作者。只有这样，才能贯彻电影为政治服务，为工农兵服务的方针，才能最充分地发挥出我们的才能智慧，为社会主义建设作出最好的贡献。
    第二，我们的任务是：在政治挂帅、艺术服从政治的大前提下，我们要努力学习，钻研技巧，大力提高中国电影的艺术、技术水平。毛泽东同志指示我们，革命的政治内容要和尽可能完美的艺术形式相结合，同时指出：“艺术上不同的形式和风格可以自由发展”。我们一方面要努力学习和逐步掌握革命现实主义与革命浪漫主义相结合的创作原则，使我们的电影艺术能够更适合于表现新时代的英雄人物，同时要坚决贯彻百花齐放、百家争鸣的方针，使各种不同形式和风格的艺术能够自由发展。我们的电影既要有最能表现中国民族精神的内容，又要有最容易为中国劳动人民所接受、所喜爱的表现形式，我们首先要通过阶级观点和时代特征来表达出中国人民的民族性格、民族精神，同时又要向工农兵学习，向我国传统艺术学习，力求适应工农群众的欣赏习惯，创造出民族化、群众化的电影艺术。
    第三，我们的任务是：要采取多种多样的办法，多快好省地培养新生力量，迅速地壮大我们的电影队伍。周恩来同志指出：“很多新的好的片子就是从文工团、从业余的文艺爱好者中间选到了优秀演员。将来还可以从摄影爱好者中间吸收优秀的摄影师，从戏剧爱好者中间吸收优秀的导演，从文学爱好者和宣传工作者中间吸收优秀的编剧和编辑，必须把现在的电影队伍、电影联谊会的组织扩大起来。”对新生力量我们要放手使用，大胆提拔，加强教育，具体帮助；年长一辈的电影工作者要把培养、教育和扩大电影队伍作为自己的责任。我们要和学校、生产部门、科学研究机构挂钩，加强共产主义协作，尽快地攻克电影科学技术的尖端；我们要努力学习马克思主义美学，加强电影评论工作，同时，还要在工人、农民、部队、机关干部和青年群众中展开群众性的影评活动，来加强我们的电影理论队伍。
    同志们，当我们在这里举行第三次文代大会的时候，我们正处身在一个我国历史上最伟大的社会主义革命和社会主义建设的时刻。国际形势很好，国内形势更好。中国人民在中国共产党和毛泽东同志的英明领导下，意气风发，斗志昂扬，正以高度的热情和创造性的劳动，为完成和超额完成1960年的国民经济计划，和提前实现全国农业发展纲要而奋斗。随着这一奔腾澎湃的社会主义建设高潮，我国所有城市和广大农村正在开展蓬蓬勃勃的技术革命和文化革命。我们先人和无数革命先烈梦寐以求的、把中国建设成为一个有现代工业、现代农业和现代科学文化的社会主义强国这一个愿望，就要在我们这一辈的年月里得到实现了。我们全国电影工作者深深地以能在这一伟大的事业中贡献出一份力量而感到光荣，我们也有决心和信心为加速建成强大的社会主义祖国和更快地过渡到共产主义的明天而担负起应尽的责任。周恩来同志在庆祝国产新片展览月的招待会上的讲话中提出：“希望二十年国庆纪念的时候，能够看到我们中国的电影的队伍和电影的创作，有几倍的或者十几倍的增长，实现跃进、跃进、更大的跃进。”党对电影事业所给予的关怀、鼓励和期望，将成为我国全体电影工作者更大跃进的动力。我们一定不辜负党对我们的殷切期望，在党的四十周年和国庆十五周年、二十周年的时候，各种片种，各个制片厂、各个部门，一定要作出更大更好的成绩，贡献更多更好的作品，来作为我们的献礼。
