	Grasp Tunneling	Kang Ren
	To do anything, you must first prepare. With preparation, and with sufficient preparation, you can do it with ease. Without preparation, or with very insufficient preparation, you will be rushed when the time comes. As the saying goes, "Don't dig a well when you're thirsty," but "Be prepared for any eventuality." That's what it means.
	For the coal industry, grasping preparatory work means grasping tunneling. Huainan's addition of twelve new coal mining faces, with each mine establishing a tunneling leading group, is one example of emphasizing tunneling. Tunneling is the first process in the coal mining industry, preparing the conditions for coal mining. Whether a coal mine's coal output is high or not depends on both how well the coal mining work is done and how well the tunneling is done. Without tunneling, it is difficult to mine coal. Fast and efficient tunneling can provide more working faces and ensure the increased production of more coal.
	Over the years, the coal industry has always considered tunneling as a priority. That is to say, while grasping extraction, we must also greatly grasp tunneling and greatly grasp preparation. However, some enterprises, in order to rush to mine coal in the short term, often emphasize extraction and neglect tunneling; they prioritize extraction and then tunneling. Simply focusing on extraction can increase coal production in the short term. But as time goes on, the weakness of tunneling not keeping up with extraction will be exposed, and the practice of rushing to mine coal can no longer continue.
	Grasping tunneling seems to be just a business issue for the coal industry. But if we step outside the business circle, isn't it also a matter of work methods? All work has distinctions between primary and secondary, root and branch, before and after, important and unimportant. If the primary and secondary are not clear, the root and branch are reversed, the before and after are not distinguished, and the important and unimportant are not differentiated, if what should be grasped is not grasped, and what is grasped is not the key, the result will inevitably be being busy all day with little effect. If the primary and secondary are clear, the root and branch are distinct, the before and after are in order, and the important and unimportant are appropriate, if what should be done first is done first without hesitation, and what should be grasped is grasped thoroughly, the result will inevitably be orderly and effective. This is the issue of distinguishing between primary and secondary, important and unimportant, and before and after in work methods, which cannot be taken lightly.

    抓掘进	康人
    做任何事情，都得事先有个准备。有了准备，而且有了充分的准备，做起来，就得心应手。没有准备，或者准备很不充分，做起来就临事仓促。俗语说不要“临渴掘井”，而要“有备无患”，就是这个意思。
    对煤炭工业来说，抓准备工作就是抓掘进。淮南新添十二个采煤工作面，各矿成立掘进领导小组，就是重视掘进的一例。掘进，是采煤工业的第一道工序，是为采煤准备条件的。一个煤矿煤炭产量高不高，一方面决定于采煤工作好不好，另一方面又决定于掘进好不好。没有掘进，就很难采煤。掘进速度快、效率高，就能提供更多的工作面，保证增产更多的煤炭。
    历年来，煤炭工业都是把掘进放在先行位置上来考虑的。这就是说，在抓回采的同时，一定要大抓掘进，大抓准备。但是，也有一些企业为了眼前突击采煤，往往重回采，轻掘进；先回采，后掘进。单纯抓回来，虽然在短时间里煤炭产量是上升了。但日子稍长，掘进赶不上回采的弱点就会暴露出来，而突击采煤的做法再也不能继续了。
    抓掘进，看来只是煤炭行业的业务问题。如果跳出业务的圈子来看，又何尝不是工作方法的问题？各项工作都有主次、本末、先后、轻重之分。主次不清，本末颠倒，先后不分，轻重无别，当抓的没有抓，抓了的又不是关键，其结果必然是忙碌终日，效果不大。主次鲜明，本末有别，先后有序，轻重有当，当先则先，毫不动摇，当抓则抓，一抓到底，其结果必然是有条不紊，成效卓著。这就是分清主次、轻重、先后的工作方法问题，不能等闲视之。
