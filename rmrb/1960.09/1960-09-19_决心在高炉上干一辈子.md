In My Position

　　Determined to Work at the Blast Furnace for a Lifetime
　　Li Feng'en, Deputy Director of the Iron Smelting Plant, Wuhan Iron and Steel Company

　　I was born in a poor mountain village in Haicheng County, Liaodong, Northeast China. My family had toiled for landlords for generations. My grandfather was strangled to death by a landlord and thrown into a well. At that time, my father was furious and wanted to file a lawsuit, but he was falsely accused and imprisoned. In that cannibalistic society, the poor could only suffer injustice.

　　From the age of seven, I herded cattle and pigs for landlords. Later, it became harder and harder to survive. My parents hardened their hearts and, carrying only two small bundles, fled with my younger siblings to Anshan as refugees. When I was eighteen, I finally got into the iron smelting plant as a handyman, where I carried large baskets for more than a decade. Those ten years were truly agonizing. Japanese devils sent foremen who were like beasts, wielding whips and forcing us to work to the point of death. We didn't dare straighten our backs for twelve hours a day, and being scolded was commonplace. If they weren't satisfied, we would be whipped. Even when we were sick from hunger or exhaustion, we had to go to work with crutches.

　　The Northeast was liberated, and the poor finally saw the light of day. Workers were transformed from beasts of burden into masters. From then on, I became a glorious iron smelting worker. I had dealt with blast furnaces for more than a decade before, but I hadn't developed any feelings for them. Now, I feel close to them.

　　Under the Party's continuous education and cultivation, my awareness improved, and my enthusiasm grew day by day. I always thought, "Smelting iron now is different from before. Before, we were smelting for the devils and the Kuomintang, but now we are smelting for ourselves. Only by smelting iron quickly and smelting more iron can we accelerate the socialist construction of the motherland and get rid of our country's backwardness of being poor and blank more quickly." From then on, I regarded the factory as my own home.

　　To further cultivate me, the Party sent me, a person over thirty who was illiterate, to a technical school, where I learned technology and theory, and improved my education. Later, I was promoted from gas worker to shift technician and deputy chief technician at the furnace front. Although I felt that I was doing too little work, the Party and the people gave me great honor. From 1952 to 1955, I was continuously rated as a special-class labor model in Anshan, and I was given the glorious title of National Advanced Producer. Even more unforgettable was that the Party sent me to study in the great Soviet Union in 1956. There, I learned a lot of valuable experience in iron smelting, and I also learned the noble communist qualities of the Soviet worker brothers. In 1957, I returned to Anshan Iron and Steel, laden with the profound friendship of the Soviet people. Shortly after returning to China, I obeyed the needs of the Party and went to the second steel capital of the motherland—Wuhan Iron and Steel. As soon as I arrived, I threw myself into the intense work of building the furnace, and I fought day and night on the construction site with the builders to strive for an early iron output. Before the blast, we completed the furnace loading work in a rush. On September 13, I and my comrades smelted the first furnace of molten iron with excitement and elation. At this moment, our beloved leader Chairman Mao came to the blast furnace and watched us finish the first furnace of iron. How much the Party and Chairman Mao cared about Wuhan Iron and Steel! My heart felt like a blooming flower, and I felt the unique joy and glory of being a new Chinese iron smelting worker.

　　I can't leave the blast furnace for a day. In order to protect the furnace and produce more iron, I often fought hard with the workers on the blast furnace. Sometimes, I didn't go home for several days and nights. When I was sleepy or tired, I would lie on the furnace platform for an hour or two, and after waking up, I would rub my eyes and work with everyone again. Later, I simply moved my bedding to the factory and went home once a week to visit.

　　1959 was a year of continuous leap forward for our country. Countless chimneys were erected on the land of the motherland, and countless large and small factories implemented the policy of combining indigenous and foreign methods, and combining large, medium, and small scales. Our Wuhan Iron and Steel's large open-hearth furnace also built three at once, and the towering No. 2 blast furnace stood beside the No. 1 furnace next to the Yangtze River. The situation of the motherland's rapid advance inspired us and further stimulated our enthusiasm. We completed the annual pig iron production plan eight and a half days ahead of schedule.

　　This year, our factory's production task has greatly increased compared to the continuously leaping 1959. The Party has entrusted us with arduous tasks, which is our glory. In order to make the blast furnace high-yield and win this year's "good start" and the first quarter's "all-around success", the factory continued to implement the policy of vigorously carrying out mass movements, and launched a climax of learning from advanced, catching up with advanced, and surpassing advanced. First, we learned from the advanced experience of Anshan Iron and Steel and launched a "joint technical performance competition". In the first performance, I worked as a furnace front worker again, guarding the tapping hole and the slag tapping hole with everyone. The performance competition was really effective. The masses were mobilized, and everyone was full of enthusiasm and worked together in unity. The output also rose sharply. Then, the company organized the second and third joint technical performance competitions, which were even more unprecedented in scale and momentum, bringing together more than 20,000 employees from 21 factories, mines, departments, offices, and sections to form a one-dragon joint technical performance competition in the iron smelting system with the blast furnace as the leader, making the daily output of pig iron rise linearly, far exceeding the design target.

　　In the march towards mechanization, semi-mechanization, automation, and semi-automation, our factory is also in full swing. Encouraged by the Party Committee's call to "dare to use foreign equipment and be the master of foreign equipment instead of being slaves to foreign equipment", the comrades carried forward the communist style of daring to think, daring to speak, and daring to act, and everyone put forward innovation suggestions. Through these movements, I have further realized the infinite power of mass movements. Mass movements are truly a magic weapon. Therefore, I have also learned the method of following the mass line in my work. When solving some key problems, I often hold professional meetings, veteran worker meetings, technical cadre meetings, and three-way combination meetings at the furnace front or in my home. These meetings have become Zhuge Liang meetings, solving many key problems.

　　Recently, the Party called for immediately launching a production increase and thrift campaign centered on grain and steel. We deeply realize that steel is the "food" of industry and also the main "food" of agricultural mechanization and agricultural capital construction. Only by insisting on completing and striving to overfulfill this year's steel production plan can we perfectly realize the comprehensive and continuous great leap forward of industry "taking steel as the key link" and better support the great development of agriculture. Therefore, we must mobilize all forces and positive factors, first ensure the increase in grain and steel production, and practice strict economy in all aspects. We must work vigorously and conscientiously.

　　Last year, I attended the National Congress of Heroes held in Beijing. The Party and the people gave me great encouragement and unparalleled strength. Shortly after returning to the factory, the Party promoted me from chief furnace technician to deputy director. The Party's cultivation and trust have made me feel even more responsible. I must bury myself in hard work and do everything possible to complete and overfulfill this year's steel production targets, listen to the Party's words better, and contact the masses more closely. At the same time, I must also study Chairman Mao's works better, use Chairman Mao's revolutionary thought to guide our work, promote the continuous revolution in our production, make the blast furnace produce more iron, and strive to build socialism and communism. I am also determined to work at the blast furnace for a lifetime!

    决心在高炉上干一辈子	武汉钢铁公司炼铁厂副厂长　李凤恩
    我出生在东北辽东海城县的一个穷山窝里，一家世世代代给地主扛活卖命，我祖父就是被地主勒死后抛在井里的。当时我父亲气得发了狂，想去告状申怨，可是反被判为诬告坐了牢，在那个人吃人的社会里，穷人只能饱尝冤苦。
    我从七岁起就给地主放牛放猪，后来越来越活不下去了，我父母狠着心，带着我和弟妹背着全家仅有的两个小包裹，离乡背井逃奔到鞍山流浪。十八岁那年好容易进了炼铁厂做杂工，就在那里抬了十几年的大筐。这十几个年头也真是活受罪，日本鬼子派了像野兽一样的工头挥着皮鞭，逼着我们没死没活的干，一天十二小时腰都不敢直，挨骂是家常便饭，他们不称心还得挨上几皮鞭。饿病了、累病了也得扶着拐杖去干活。
    东北解放了，穷人才见了天日，工人由牛马变成了主人，从此我成了一个光荣的炼铁工人，以前和高炉打了十几年交道，没建立感情，这下对它可亲切了。
    在党的不断教育培养下，我的觉悟提高了，干劲也一天天大起来。我总是这样想：“现在炼铁和以前不同，以前是给鬼子和国民党炼，而现在是给自己炼，只有快炼铁、多炼铁，才能加快祖国的社会主义建设，才能更快摆脱我国一穷二白的落后面貌”。我从此把工厂当成了自己的家。
    党为了进一步培养我，又把我这个年过三十、一字不识的人送进了技术学校，既学到了技术和理论，又提高了文化。以后又把我从瓦斯工提升为值班技术员、炉前副总技师。尽管我感到自己做的工作太少，但党和人民给了我极大的荣誉。1952年到1955年连续被评为鞍山市的特等劳模，又给予我全国先进生产者的光荣称号。更难忘的是党在1956年派我到伟大的苏联去学习，在那里我学到了很多炼铁方面的宝贵经验，也学到了苏联工人兄弟的高贵的共产主义品质。1957年我满载着苏联人民的深厚友谊回到了鞍钢。回国后不久，我服从了党的需要，到了祖国第二钢都——武钢。我一到就投入了建炉的紧张工作中，和建设者们一道为争取早日出铁日夜苦战在工地。在送风前，我们又突击完成了装炉工作。9月13日我和同志们以激动、兴奋的心情炼出了第一炉铁水。就在这个时候，我们敬爱的领袖毛主席来到了高炉，看我们出完了第一炉铁。党和毛主席是多么关怀武钢呀！我的心像怒放的鲜花一样，感到作一个新中国炼铁工人特有的快乐和光荣。
    高炉，我一天也不能离开他，为了保护好炉子多出铁，我经常和工人同志在一起苦战在高炉上。有时几天几夜不回家，困了、累了就在炉台上躺上一两个小时，醒来后搓搓眼睛又和大家一起干。以后干脆把被子搬到厂里住，一个星期回家一次看看。
    1959年是我国持续跃进的一年。在祖国的大地上又竖起了无数的烟囱，无数的大小厂房实行了土洋并举，大中小并举的方针。我们的武钢大平炉也一下子建起了三个，巍峨的二号高炉又并依着一号炉耸立在扬子江旁。祖国飞跃前进的形势鼓舞着我们，更激发了我们的干劲，我们提前八天半完成了全年生铁生产计划。
    今年，我厂的生产任务比持续跃进的1959年又大大增长。党把艰巨的任务交给我们，这是我们的光荣。为了使高炉高产，夺取今年的开门红和一季度的满堂红，厂里继续贯彻了大搞群众运动的方针，掀起了一个学先进、赶先进、超先进的高潮，首先学习了鞍钢先进经验，开展“联合技术表演赛”。在第一次表演中我又当了炉前工，和大家一道把守着出铁口、出渣口。表演赛真有效，群众都发动起来了，个个干劲冲天，协作一致，产量也顿时上升。接着公司又组织了第二次、第三次联合技术表演赛，这两次更是规模空前，声势浩大，集中了二十一个厂、矿、部、处、室的二万多名职工，组成了以高炉为龙头的炼铁系统一条龙联合技术表演赛，使生铁日产量直线上升，远远超过了设计指标。
    在向机械化、半机械化，自动化、半自动化进军当中，我厂也搞得热火朝天，同志们在党委提出的“敢于向洋设备开刀，当洋设备的主人不当洋设备的奴隶”的号召鼓舞下，发扬了敢想敢说敢干的共产主义风格，人人提革新建议。通过这些运动，使我更进一步体会到群众运动的无穷威力，群众运动真是一个大法宝。因此我也学会了在工作中走群众路线的方法。在解决一些关键问题时，我常常在炉前或者在我的家里召开专业会、老工人会、技术干部会和三结合会，这些会都成了诸葛亮会，解决了很多关键问题。
    最近党号召立即开展一个以粮、钢为中心的增产节约运动，我们深深体会到，钢是工业的“粮食”，也是农业机械化和农业基本建设的主要“粮食”。坚持完成和争取超额完成今年钢产量计划，才能完满地实现工业“以钢为纲”的全面继续大跃进，才能更好地支援农业大发展。因此，我们必须调动一切力量和积极因素，首先保证粮和钢的增产，并且从各方面厉行节约，要既轰轰烈烈又踏踏实实地干。
    去年我出席了在北京召开的全国群英会，党和人民给了我极大的鼓舞和无比的力量。回厂后不久，党又把我从高炉总技师提升为副厂长。党的培养和信任使我越发感到责任重大。我一定埋头苦干、千方百计地为完成和超额完成今年的钢铁生产指标，更好地听党的话，更密切地联系群众，同时还要更好地学习毛主席的著作，以毛主席的革命思想来指导我们的工作，推动我们生产上的不断革命，使高炉出更多的铁，为建成社会主义和共产主义而努力。我也下定决心，在高炉上干一辈子！
