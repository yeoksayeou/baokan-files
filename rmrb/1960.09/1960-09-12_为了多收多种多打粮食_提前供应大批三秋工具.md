Xinhua News Agency Dispatch: To harvest more, plant more, and produce more grain, commercial departments in various regions have prepared a large quantity of agricultural production materials, which are being continuously transferred to rural areas.

    According to the characteristics of this year's large autumn crop planting area, the "Three-Autumn" materials supplied by commercial departments in various regions have been supplied earlier than in previous years, and the quantity has also increased significantly. As of the end of August, the country has supplied more than 43,000 semi-mechanized harvesting machines for "Three-Autumn", more than 90,000 threshing machines, more than 45,000 seeding machines, more than 1 million new-style sickles, more than 100,000 double-shared plows, and more than 220 million various iron small farm tools. Together with the existing inventory of materials in various regions, the supply of semi-mechanized farm tools and small farm tools for this year's "Three-Autumn" will increase by about one time compared with last year. The supply of pesticides for autumn sowing seed mixing has also increased by 80% to 90% compared with last year. In order to ensure that the modernized agricultural machinery already supplied to rural areas can better play its role in the "Three-Autumn", commercial departments have also strengthened the supply of tractor and internal combustion engine accessories. As of August 20, the total value of tractor and internal combustion engine accessories supplied nationwide reached more than 110 million yuan, an increase of about two times more than the same period last year. At present, these agricultural production materials are being continuously transferred to the countryside. In Heilongjiang Province, 80% of the autumn harvest materials have been allocated to the countryside.

    In this year's "Three-Autumn" material supply, many regional commercial departments, while doing a good job in the supply of mechanized farm tools, have coordinated with relevant departments to seize the promotion of improved farm tools and the production and supply of small farm tools. The Liangping County Commercial Department in Sichuan Province has made the supply of improved farm tools with good quality and high efficiency as the central task of the "Three-Autumn" material supply work. By the end of July, the county had supplied more than 47,000 improved farm tools such as rapid rice cutters, push-shear harvesters, threshing machines, three-purpose threshers, and wheat trenching machines, so that each production team has semi-mechanized farm tools.

    In order to promote the development of small farm tool production, commercial departments in various regions have implemented the policy of "obtaining materials locally, manufacturing locally, and supplying locally," and have provided strong support to the communes in terms of raw materials and technology. The Zhaotong County Commercial Department in Yunnan Province has assigned special personnel to help communes arrange the production of small farm tools. Some communes do not produce raw materials such as iron, wood, and bamboo, while some communes have relatively abundant raw materials. The commercial department has linked them up to promote mutual adjustment between communes. At present, the small farm tools prepared by this county account for more than 90% of the required amount. According to the historical production habits of various places, the Pinghu County Commercial Department in Zhejiang Province organized the commune-run industries or commune sideline production teams of seven communes in the county to engage in small farm tool manufacturing on a large scale. The commercial department also sent fifteen cadres to these factories to impart technology and exchange experience. Therefore, this year the county's small farm tools are not only large in quantity, but also good in quality and material-saving, which the communes are very satisfied with.

    There have also been great improvements in the supply methods of "Three-Autumn" agricultural production materials. Many regional commercial departments have sent cadres and workers to the front line of agricultural production, eating, living, and working with commune members, so as to truly understand the needs and make timely supplies. Yongnian County in Hebei Province has drawn more than 2,000 people from the county commercial bureau to grassroots stores to form a large army to support agricultural production. They launched a "Four-Take Care to Guarantee a Bumper Harvest Movement" of "weeding when grass is seen, eliminating insects when insects are seen, supplying goods when they are out of stock, and repairing when they are broken." Within a week, they supplied more than 50,000 yuan of urgently needed materials for production, repaired more than 1,000 machines and farm tools, and also helped communes weed and control insects on more than 8,000 mu. Anyang City in Henan Province adopted the method of setting up stores in large squares, sheds in medium squares, and mobile services in small squares. It drew more than 1,000 commercial employees to establish 47 square field service stations, which not only supply production materials, but also supply living materials, and are responsible for both machine tool repair and technology transfer, which greatly facilitates the masses.

    为了多收多种多打粮食  提前供应大批三秋工具
    据新华社讯　各地商业部门为秋收、秋耕、秋种准备了大批农业生产资料，正源源向农村调运。
    根据今年秋季作物种植面积大的特点，各地商业部门供应的“三秋”物资，时间比往年提早，数量也显著增加。截至8月底，全国已供应“三秋”用的半机械化收割机具四万三千多件，脱谷机具九万多件，播种机具四万五千多件，新式镰一百多万件，双铧犁十万多件，各种铁制小农具二亿二千多万件。加上各地现有的库存物资，今年供应“三秋”的半机械化农具和小农具，将比去年增加一倍左右。供应秋播拌种用的农药，也比去年增加了80％到90％。为了保证已经供应到农村的现代化农业机械在“三秋”中更好地发挥作用，商业部门还加强了拖拉机和内燃机配件的供应工作。截至8月20日，全国已供应的拖拉机、内燃机配件共达一亿一千多万元，比去年同期增加了约两倍多。目前这些农业生产资料正源源调运下乡。黑龙江省已有80％的秋收物资下拨到农村。
    在今年的“三秋”物资供应中，许多地区商业部门在做好机械化农具供应的同时，协同有关部门抓紧了改良农具的推广和小农具的生产供应工作。四川省梁平县商业部门把供应质量好、工效高的改良农具，作为“三秋”物资供应工作的中心任务。到7月底，全县已供应快速割禾器、推剪式收割机、打谷机、三用脱粒机、小麦开沟机等改良农具四万七千多件，做到每个生产队都有半机械化农具。
    为了促进小农具生产的发展，各地商业部门贯彻“就地取材，就地制造，就地供应”的方针，从原料、技术等方面给公社以有力的支援。云南省昭通县商业部门抽出专人帮助公社安排小农具生产，有的公社不产铁、木、竹等原料，有的公社原料比较丰富，商业部门就挂钩联系，促使公社之间互相调剂有无。目前这个县已准备的小农具占需要量的90％以上。浙江省平湖县商业部门根据各地历史上的生产习惯，组织全县七个公社的社办工业或公社的副业生产队大搞小农具制造。商业部门还抽出十五个干部驻到这些工厂去传授技术，交流经验，因此今年这个县的小农具不但数量多，而且质量好，用料省，公社十分满意。
    在“三秋”农业生产资料的供应方法上，也有很大改进。不少地区商业部门派出干部和职工深入农业生产第一线，与社员同吃同住同劳动，做到切实了解需要，及时进行供应。河北省永年县从县商业局到基层商店抽出二千多人组成支援农业生产大军，深入生产队、丰产方，展开了一个“见草就除，见虫就灭，缺货就供，见坏就修”的“四就保丰收运动”，一周内就供应了生产上急需的物资五万多元，修好机器、农具一千多件，还帮助公社锄草、治虫八千多亩。河南省安阳市采取大方设店、中方设棚、小方流动服务的方法，抽出一千多名商业职工建立方田服务站四十七个，既供应生产资料，也供应生活资料，既负责机具修配又负责传授技术，大大便利了群众。
