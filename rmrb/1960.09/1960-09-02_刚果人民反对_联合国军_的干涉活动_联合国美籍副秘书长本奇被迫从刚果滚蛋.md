Xinhua News Agency, Leopoldville, 31st. The overbearing "United Nations forces" continue to clash with Congolese troops who are defending national sovereignty. It is reported that new clashes between "United Nations forces" officers and Congolese troops have occurred in Banningville, 250 kilometers northeast of the Congolese capital of Leopoldville. Four overbearing "United Nations" personnel were arrested by Congolese troops.

At the same time, the "United Nations forces" are still threatening the Congolese government regarding the incident a few days ago in Stanleyville in which Congolese soldiers punished American officers.

Reports say that UN Under-Secretary-General, American Ralph Bunche, and the US Ambassador to the Congo, Timberlake, defended the actions of the US Air Force personnel who caused the incident on the 28th and 29th and even made a counter-attack, lodging so-called "protests" with the Congolese government.

According to reports, when the US Air Force plane that these American soldiers were flying in flew to Leopoldville Airport after the incident occurred, Van Horn, the commander of the "United Nations forces" in the Congo, "displayed strength" to the Congolese at the airport. He menacingly deployed 300 "United Nations forces" around the American plane, and he himself, wearing a pistol, shouted: "If any interference occurs, I will be the first to fire the first shot."

The activities of the "United Nations forces" manipulated by the United States in the Congo are increasingly opposed by the Congolese people. UN Under-Secretary-General Ralph Bunche admitted at a press conference in Leopoldville on the 29th that the "United Nations" will continue to encounter difficulties in the Congo because the Congolese people have "deep psychological suspicions." The American also said that he had never been to a place as prone to "misunderstandings" as the Congo. He denied that Belgians had worn "United Nations forces" uniforms to engage in nefarious activities; however, he admitted that "there is obviously some black market trading in United Nations armbands."

Other reports say that after the Congolese government forces captured Bakwanga City, the stronghold of the secessionist group in Kasai province led by the imperialists, a unit of "United Nations forces" protected 130 colonialists there.

Xinhua News Agency, Leopoldville, 31st. Amidst a chorus of opposition from the Congolese people, the American UN Under-Secretary-General Ralph Bunche was finally forced to quietly fly out of the Congolese capital Leopoldville on the 30th and return to New York.

This American, Ralph Bunche, who was deeply hated by the Congolese people, before the United Nations formally discussed the Congo issue, acted in accordance with the will of US imperialism, and went to the Congo in the name of the UN Secretary-General Hammarskjöld's personal representative to carry out conspiracies and engage in activities to undermine Congo's national independence.

Because Bunche had done all kinds of bad things in the Congo and was notorious, Hammarskjöld had to announce his recall on the 20th of this month. It was announced that Bunche would be replaced by Rajeshwar Dayal, the current Indian High Commissioner to Pakistan. Dayal served as a member of the three-person observation team sent by the United Nations to Lebanon in 1958.

    刚果人民反对“联合国军”的干涉活动
    联合国美籍副秘书长本奇被迫从刚果滚蛋
    新华社31日讯　利奥波德维尔消息：蛮横的“联合国军”不断和维护国家主权的刚果军队发生冲突。据报道，在距离刚果首都利奥波德维尔东北二百五十公里的班南维尔，又发生了“联合国军”官员和刚果军队的新的冲突。四名蛮横的“联合国”人员被刚果军队逮捕。
    同时，“联合国军”仍在就前几天刚果士兵在斯坦利维尔痛惩美国军官的事件威胁刚果政府。
    消息说，联合国副秘书长、美国人本奇和美国驻刚果大使廷伯累克28日和29日分别为这次事件的肇事者美国空军人员的行为辩护，并且还反咬一口，向刚果政府提出所谓“抗议”。
    据报道，当这些美国军人所驾驶的那架美国空军飞机在事变发生后飞到利奥波德维尔机场时，在刚果的“联合国军”司令范霍恩在机场上向刚果人“显示力量”。他杀气腾腾地在那架美国飞机四周布置了三百名“联合国军”，他本人则佩带手枪，叫嚷说：“如果发生任何干涉的话，我就首先开第一枪。”
    美国操纵下的“联合国军”在刚果的活动愈来愈遭到刚果人民的反对。联合国副秘书长本奇29日在利奥波德维尔的一次记者招待会上承认说，“联合国”将继续在刚果碰到困难，因为刚果人“心理上的怀疑很深”。这个美国人还说，他没有到过像刚果这样容易发生“误会”的地方。他抵赖比利时人曾穿着“联合国军”制服从事不可告人的活动；但是，他承认“显然在联合国臂章方面有某种黑市交易”。
    另有消息说，在刚果政府军队攻下了帝国主义扶植的开赛省卡隆吉分裂集团的巢穴巴克旺加城之后，“联合国军”的一支部队保护着那里的一百三十名殖民者。
    新华社31日讯　利奥波德维尔消息：在刚果人民一片反对声中，美国籍联合国副秘书长本奇终于在30日被迫悄悄地乘飞机滚出刚果首都利奥波德维尔，飞回纽约。
    这个为刚果人民深恶痛绝的美国人本奇，还在联合国正式讨论刚果问题之前，就秉承美帝国主义的意志，以联合国秘书长哈马舍尔德私人代表的名义，到刚果进行阴谋活动，从事破坏刚果民族独立的勾当。
    由于本奇在刚果做尽了坏事，臭名远扬，哈马舍尔德不得不在本月20日宣布把他撤回。据宣布，代替本奇的将是印度现任驻巴基斯坦高级专员拉杰希瓦尔·达雅尔。达雅尔1958年曾担任过联合国派驻黎巴嫩的三人观察小组成员。
