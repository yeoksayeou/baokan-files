According to Heilongjiang Daily, inspired by the calls of the Central, Provincial, and Municipal Committees to launch an increase production and conservation campaign centered on grain and steel, the people of Tailai County launched a "small autumn harvest" campaign to extract wealth from barren mountains and wilderness throughout the county, achieving great results. As of September 8th, the county had collected a total of 7,000 tons of various wild grass seeds such as wild millet, buckwheat, water barnyardgrass, cocklebur, seepweed, and water caltrop, 42,000 tons of Leymus chinensis, and over 10,000 tons of silage feed, with a total value of 1,469,000 yuan.

Due to this year's heavy rainfall, various wild plants in Tailai County have grown luxuriantly. In low-lying areas, plains, sand dunes, barren mountains, roadsides, housesides, and river and lake edges, many starch and oil-rich wild plants have grown and matured, with abundant seeds. In order to harvest this huge wealth in a timely and comprehensive manner and allow wild plants to serve socialist construction, the Tailai County Committee of the Communist Party of China deployed the "small autumn harvest" work as early as mid-August, calling on urban and rural people to march towards barren mountains and wilderness and extract wealth from wild plants. All parts of the county universally organized cadres and members with experience in collecting wild plants to conduct detailed surveys deep into barren mountains and wilderness, and dispatched some members, students, workers, and cadres to collect early-maturing grass seeds.

After most of the grass seeds matured, in accordance with the spirit of the Central, Provincial, and Municipal Committees' call to launch an increase production and conservation campaign centered on grain and steel, the Tailai County Committee, while ensuring the continued strengthening of wheat threshing, delivery, and late-stage field management, extracted approximately 100,000 members, students, workers, cadres, and urban residents to invest in the "small autumn harvest" battle. They adopted a short-term assault method, seizing the opportunity to harvest all kinds of wild grass seeds at the fastest speed and in the shortest time.

Before the start of the campaign, all localities universally implemented manpower, tasks, quality, time, remuneration, collection and transportation, and management work based on resource and variety conditions. They also adopted measures such as having elderly, young people, and women with many children collect plants that are close to home, scattered, and easy to collect; and having young and middle-aged men and women collect plants that are far from home, large-scale, and difficult to collect. This approach has generally achieved remarkable results. Seventy members of the Ala Xin Management Area of the Da Xing People's Commune not only harvested all of the wild millet on more than 30 hectares of land in three days, yielding more than 20,000 catties of millet, but also collected a large number of other grass seeds. During the "small autumn harvest" campaign, People's Commune members, students, government cadres, enterprise employees, and urban residents, with soaring enthusiasm, widely launched red flag competitions comparing quantity and quality between districts, teams, streets, courtyards, and individuals, further stimulating the enthusiasm of the gathering army. After five days of hard work by 70,000 troops across the county, as of September 4th, a total of 5,060 tons of various wild grass seeds had been collected. In order to strengthen the collection, transportation, storage, and management of these grass seeds, commercial and industrial departments uniformly organized the procurement work. The management areas and production teams of rural People's Communes universally designated dedicated personnel to be responsible for leadership and management work, and universally achieved collection, drying, acceptance, weighing, and procurement together.

    根据资源品种合理安排采集力量
    用最快速度索取野生植物
    黑龙江泰来县“小秋收”声势大效果好
    据黑龙江日报消息　泰来县人民在中央和省、市委关于开展以粮、钢为中心的增产节约运动的号召鼓舞下，在全县范围内开展一个向荒山野地索取财富的“小秋收”运动，取得了很大成绩。到9月8日统计，全县共采集了野生稷子、落生荞麦、水稗子、苍耳、碱蓬棵、菱角等各种野生草籽七千吨，打羊草四万二千吨，青贮饲料一万余吨，总价值达一百四十六万九千元。
    泰来县，由于今年多雨，各种野生植物茂密丛生，在低洼地区、平原、沙丘、荒山和路旁、宅旁、河沟泡沿，生长了许多含有淀粉和油质的野生植物，相继成熟，籽粒丰硕。中共泰来县委为了把这批巨大的财富，适时地全部地收获回来，让野生植物为社会主义建设服务，早在8月中旬就布置了开展“小秋收”的工作，号召城乡人民向荒山野地进军，向野生植物索取财富。全县各地普遍组织了采集野生植物有经验的干部和社员，深入荒山野地做了详细勘查，并出动了部分社员、学生和职工、干部采集早熟的草籽。
    在大部分草籽成熟以后，泰来县委本着中央和省委、市委关于开展以粮、钢为中心的增产节约运动的精神，在保证继续加强小麦打、送和田间后期管理的基础上，抽出部分社员和学生、职工、干部以及城镇居民共十万左右人投入“小秋收”的战役。他们采取短期突击的方法，不失时机，用最快的速度，在最短的时间内，将各种野生草籽全部收获回来。
    运动开始以前，各地就普遍根据资源和品种情况，落实了人力、任务、质量、时间、报酬、集运和管理工作。并且采取了老年、少年和多子女的妇女采集离家近的、零散的、容易采集的；青壮年男女采集离家远的、大面积的、不好采集的。这样做，普遍收到了显著效果。大兴人民公社阿拉新管理区的七十名男女社员，三天时间，不仅将三十余公顷地的野生稷子全部收获回来，打出二万余斤稷子，并且还采集了大量的其他草籽。在“小秋收”运动中，人民公社社员、学生、机关干部、企业职工、城镇居民等各路大军，干劲冲天，广泛展开了区与区、队与队、街与街、院与院、人与人的比数量、比质量的红旗大竞赛，更加激发了采集大军的积极性。全县七万大军，经过五天的奋战，到9月4日统计，共采集了各种野生草籽五千零六十吨。为了加强这部分草籽的集运、收贮和管理工作，商业部门和工业部门统一组织了收购工作。农村人民公社的管理区、生产队普遍指定了专人负责领导和管理工作，普遍做到了随采集、随晾晒、随验收、随检斤、随收购。（附图片）
