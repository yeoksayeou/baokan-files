Xinhua News Agency, September 9th. The premiere reception for the color documentary film “Conquering the World's Highest Peak,” depicting the ascent of Mount Everest by China’s mountaineering athletes, was held at the Capital Cinema tonight. The film will be officially released in Beijing starting from the 10th.

Li Da and Rong Gaotang, Vice Chairmen of the National Sports Commission, Shi Zhanchun, Captain of the Chinese Mountaineering Team, Xu Jing, Deputy Captain, and athletes Gongbu, Wang Fengtong, Weng Qingzhang, Yuan Yang, and other mountaineers, as well as more than 1,200 spectators from all walks of life in the capital, attended the reception.

Gao Ge, Director of the Beijing Municipal Film Bureau, paid tribute to the heroes who conquered the world's highest peak and expressed his gratitude to all the personnel involved in the filming work. He hoped that everyone would learn from the mountaineers' heroic spirit of not fearing difficulties, being tenacious and brave, learn from their great communist spirit of solidarity and selflessness, and learn from their excellent work style of perseverance, hard work, seeking truth from facts, and noble qualities of wholeheartedly serving the Party, the people, and the revolutionary cause.

After introducing the mountaineers, Shi Zhanchun, Captain of the Chinese Mountaineering Team, spoke. He said: The release of this film once again proves the Party’s care for sports and is a great encouragement and spur to all mountaineers. Subsequently, the mountaineers received flowers.

The film “Conquering the World's Highest Peak” records the main itineraries of the mountaineering heroes' four marches, as well as the mountaineers "settling down" at the base camp at an altitude of 5,120 meters. In the film, people can see the mountaineering heroes marching in the strange world of ice and snow, climbing the dangerous slopes of the North Col, and fighting against the raging winds. The Chinese Mountaineering Team reached the summit of Mount Everest in the dark, making it impossible to film the details of the summit, but when the mountaineering hero Qu Yinhua returned to 8,700 meters above sea level, he took pictures of the summit, newly covered with snow, and the vast sea of clouds below the mountain in the morning light. These are two extremely rare shots. The support from all over the country for the mountaineering team, as well as the tense and arduous work of the many unsung heroes of the mountaineering team, were also captured on film.

The Central Newsreel and Documentary Film Studio selected excellent photographers Mou Sen and Wang Ximao to undertake the filming work of this film. During the three-month filming process, the photographers and mountaineers shared weal and woe and cooperated closely. When they reached 7,400 meters above sea level, they were unable to continue filming due to excessive physical fatigue, and the mountaineers immediately took over the filming tasks. Many valuable shots in the film were taken by the mountaineering heroes themselves. The filming work of this film received great support from the Party Committee of the Mountaineering Team. The Party Committee held a special meeting to study the filming work and designated excellent mountaineers Qu Yinhua, Shi Jing, Wang Fuzhou, Xu Jing, and Liu Dayi to form a filming team to fully assist the photographers in completing the filming tasks.

    描写登山英雄彩色纪录影片
    “征服世界最高峰”今天上映
    新华社9日讯　描写我国登山健儿登上珠穆朗玛峰的彩色纪录影片“征服世界最高峰”试映招待会，今晚在首都电影院举行。这部影片将从10日起在北京正式上映。
    国家体委副主任李达、荣高棠，中国登山队队长史占春、副队长许竞，运动健将贡布、王凤桐、翁庆章、袁扬等登山运动员，以及首都各界观众一千二百多人出席了招待会。
    北京市电影事业管理局局长高戈在讲话中，向征服世界最高峰的英雄致敬，向参加拍摄工作的全体人员表示谢意。他希望大家学习我国登山运动员不怕困难、顽强勇敢的豪迈气概，学习他们那种团结无间、舍己为公的伟大的共产主义精神，学习他们坚韧不拔、埋头苦干、实事求是的优良作风和全心全意为党为人民为革命事业的高贵品质。
    在介绍了登山运动员以后，中国登山队队长史占春讲了话。他说：这部影片的上映，又一次证明了党对体育事业的关怀，是对全体登山运动员很大的鼓励和鞭策。接着，登山运动员们接受了献花。
    “征服世界最高峰”影片纪录了登山英雄四次行军的主要行程，以及登山运动员们在拔海五千一百二十米的大本营“安家落户”等的情况。人们在影片中可以看到登山英雄们行军在奇异的冰雪世界，攀登北坳险坡以及和狂风搏斗等的场面。中国登山队登上珠穆朗玛峰，正值天色昏黑，无法拍摄顶峰的详情，但是登山英雄屈银华在回到拔海八千七百米时，趁着晨曦拍下了刚刚被新雪盖住的顶峰和山下的茫茫云海。这是两个极其难得的镜头。全国各地对登山队的支援，以及登山队的许多无名英雄紧张而艰苦的工作情景也被摄入镜头。
    中央新闻纪录电影制片厂选派优秀摄影师牟森和王喜茂，担任这部影片的拍摄工作。在三个多月的拍摄过程中，摄影师和登山队员们同甘共苦，密切合作。当他们到达拔海七千四百米的时候，因体力过度疲劳，不能继续拍摄，登山队员马上承担起拍摄任务。影片中的许多宝贵镜头，都是登山英雄自己亲手拍摄的。这部影片的拍摄工作得到登山队党委的极大支持。党委曾专门召开会议，研究拍摄工作，并指定优秀登山运动员屈银华、石竞、王富洲、许竞、刘大义等人组成拍摄小组，全力协助摄影师完成拍摄任务。
