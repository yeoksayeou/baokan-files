Xinhua News Agency, August 31st: Primary and secondary school teachers and students across the country have finished their enjoyable summer vacation and are entering the new school year, which begins on September 1st, with energy and confidence.

To adapt to the teaching reform work in the new school year and continuously improve teaching quality, the education departments of many provinces, cities, and autonomous regions, based on the principle of combining work and rest, used part of the summer vacation to organize in-service training for full-time school teachers, which greatly improved the political and professional level of the majority of teachers. According to incomplete statistics from Shandong, Shanxi, Hunan, and Shaanxi provinces and Tianjin and Shenyang cities, more than 510,000 primary and secondary school teachers participated in in-service training during the summer. In Putian County, Fujian, more than 4,300 primary school teachers, through summer in-service training, generally prepared lessons, formulated teaching plans and schedules for each subject for the new school year based on discussing new teaching materials and exchanging teaching experiences, and made full preparations for welcoming the tasks of the new school year.

Before the start of school, under the care of Party committees at all levels and the proper arrangements of relevant departments, the summer vacation life of primary and secondary school teachers and students in various places was rich, colorful, pleasant, and meaningful. Teachers from primary and secondary schools in Guangzhou jointly held "Water Activities Day" and a get-together. Many teachers organized short trips to scenic spots. Many other teachers spent their summer vacation in sanatoriums in beautiful scenic areas. Schools in Chongqing, Shanghai, Harbin and other cities generally carried out military sports activities and recreational activities such as swimming, table tennis competitions, story meetings, garden parties, and cultural evenings. At the same time, the majority of teachers and students enthusiastically responded to the Party's call and actively supported agricultural production. Tens of thousands of teachers and students in various places used their vacations to go to people's communes to participate in labor and support summer harvesting and planting.
