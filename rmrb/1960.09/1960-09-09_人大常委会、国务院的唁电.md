Messages of Condolence from the NPC Standing Committee and the State Council
To the Presidium of the People's Chamber of the German Democratic
Republic,
To the Council of Ministers of the German Democratic Republic:

    The Chinese people and the Chinese government have learned with deep sorrow of the passing of Comrade Wilhelm Pieck, President of the German Democratic Republic. We, on behalf of the Chinese people and government, extend our deepest condolences to the people and government of the German Democratic Republic.

    Comrade Wilhelm Pieck was a loyal son of the German people and a close friend of the Chinese people. The passing of Comrade Wilhelm Pieck is a great loss not only for the German people but also for the people of all socialist countries and the working people of the world. We are convinced that in these sorrowful days, the German people will transform grief into strength, unite more closely around the Socialist Unity Party of Germany and the government of the German Democratic Republic, and resolutely struggle for the construction of socialism, the realization of the peaceful reunification of the fatherland, and the defense of world peace.
  　Standing Committee of the National People's Congress of the People's Republic of China
          State Council of the People's Republic of China
