(News from Shenyang Daily) To ensure that the people of the city spend a warm and comfortable winter, and to vigorously save coal, the Shenyang Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party has mobilized the masses early to build hot-air furnace "native heating" systems. At present, more than 440 large and small hot-air furnaces have been built throughout the city; the You'ai Lane Red Flag Courtyard in the Xiaoxi Commune of the Shenhe District has achieved "native heating."

There are more than 20,000 collective and individual heating units in Shenyang, most of which do not have heating equipment and used coal stoves for heating in the past. Since the large-scale establishment of urban people's communes, after the vast number of women have taken up social production posts, there is an urgent need for more convenient and comfortable heating equipment. Based on the experience of the national hot-air furnace on-site meeting held in Nenjiang County, Heilongjiang Province, the Shenyang Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party decided to fully mobilize the masses to build hot-air furnaces. The Municipal Coal Industry Building Materials Company dispatched a group of full-time cadres and technical personnel to go deep into collective welfare units, catering service industries, and residents to widely promote the advantages of hot-air furnaces, such as convenience, coal saving, hygiene, safety, and ease of construction and repair. They also conducted pilot work in the You'ai Lane Red Flag Courtyard in Shenhe District. After mobilizing the masses for two concentrated efforts, all 157 households in this courtyard achieved "native heating."

The news of the successful pilot quickly spread to all corners of the city, arousing the attention of leaders in various districts and the broad masses. They all visited the You'ai Lane Red Flag Courtyard to observe and learn. A mass upsurge of building hot-air furnaces was launched throughout the city. The broad masses all relied on their own efforts, actively finding ways to find bricks, iron plates, and other materials, and rushed to build furnaces.

In the high tide of building hot-air furnaces, the Municipal Coal Industry Building Materials Company sent a large number of cadres to go deep into furnace construction units, courtyards, and residential groups. If the masses lacked lime, iron buckets, iron pipes, etc., they would try every means to find solutions; if the masses did not understand the furnace construction technology or lacked manpower, they would help design sketches and become bricklayers themselves. Due to the adoption of the method of the masses working together, focusing on helping and driving the general, more than 200 hot-air furnaces of various forms were built in the first month or so.

Hot-air furnaces are divided into two types: horizontal and vertical. The horizontal type is suitable for collective units with a larger heating area. The vertical type has a lower thermal efficiency than the horizontal type and is suitable for units with a smaller heating area. Hot-air furnaces for residents are divided into three types. One type is a hot-air furnace that can be used for both cooking and heating; another type is a hot-air furnace that can be used for cooking, heating, and warming the kang (heated platform bed). There is also a neighborhood mutual aid hot-air furnace, which has two hot-air pipes installed on the hot-air furnace. One pipe is for heating one's own room, and the other pipe is connected to the employee's house that is unattended during the day, so that not only does one's own house get warm from burning the fire, but the neighbor's house also gets warm.

Hot-air furnaces have many advantages. According to the test results of various units, the use of hot-air furnaces can generally save 30% to 40% of coal compared to burning coal stoves, and some can even reach more than 50%; hot-air furnaces have good heat dissipation performance, the temperature is normal, and there are no disadvantages of sudden cold and sudden heat; they can reduce dust, make the room more hygienic and safe and reliable; after adding fuel, they can make smoke, fire, and wind work at the same time, achieving multiple uses in one furnace; the structure is simple, easy to repair and build, and can save stoves.

    一家生火　几家取暖　温暖舒适　节约煤炭
    沈阳建成四百四十多座“土暖气”
    本报讯　据沈阳日报消息：为使全市人民温暖、舒适地过冬，并大力节约煤炭，中共沈阳市委及早发动群众大建热风炉“土暖气”。现在，全市已建成大小热风炉四百四十余座；沈河区小西公社友爱里红旗大院已实现“土暖气化”。
    沈阳市有两万多个集体的和个体的取暖单位，大部分没有暖气设备，过去是用煤炉子取暖。由于大办城市人民公社，广大家庭妇女走上社会生产岗位以后，迫切需要有更方便、舒适的取暖设备。中共沈阳市委根据在黑龙江省嫩江县召开的全国性暖风炉现场会议的经验，确定充分发动群众大建热风炉。市煤业建筑器材公司抽出一批专职干部和技术力量，深入到集体福利事业单位、饮食服务行业和居民群众中广泛宣传热风炉方便、省煤、卫生、安全、容易修造等好处，并在沈河区友爱里红旗大院进行了试点工作。经过发动群众进行两次突击，使这个大院一百五十七户全部实现了“土暖气化”。
    试点成功的消息很快传遍了全市各个角落，引起了各区领导和广大群众的重视，都纷纷到友爱里红旗大院参观、学习。全市掀起了一个群众性的大造热风炉的热潮。广大群众都自力更生，积极设法，找砖头、铁板等器材，突击建炉。
    在大造热风炉的高潮中，市煤业建筑器材公司派出大批干部深入建炉单位、大院和居民组。群众缺白灰、铁桶、铁管等，他们就千方百计地想办法解决；群众不懂建炉技术，人手不足，他们就帮助设计草图，自己动手当泥瓦匠。由于采取群众齐动手，重点帮助、带动一般的作法，在开始的一个多月的时间内，就建起了各种各样形式的热风炉二百多座。
    热风炉分卧式和立式两种。卧式的适用于供暖面积较大的集体单位。立式的较卧式热度效率低一些，适用于供暖面积较小的单位。居民用的热风炉分为三种。一种是做饭取暖两用热风炉；一种是做饭、取暖、烧炕三用热风炉。还有一种是邻里互助热风炉，在热风炉上安两个热风管，一根自己室内取暖，另一根通向白天家中没有人照料的职工住房，这样不仅自己烧火取了暖，邻户也取了暖。
    热风炉有许多优点，据各单位试验结果，使用热风炉一般比烧煤炉子能节省煤炭30％至40％，有的还可达到50％以上；热风炉散热性能好，温度正常，没有暴冷暴热的缺点；能减少灰尘，使室内更加卫生并安全可靠；加上燃料之后，可以使烟、火、风同时发挥作用，达到一炉多用；构造简单，容易修造，而且可以节省炉具。
