Intensify Late-Stage Cotton Field Management Under Unfavorable Temperatures
Shuangwang Management Area Promotes Zhang Qiuxiang's Experience

　　Xi'an, September 23 (reporting for this paper) The Shuangwang Management Area of Chengguan Commune, Weinan County, Shaanxi Province, has vigorously promoted the cultivation method of combining promotion and control created by Zhang Qiuxiang's cotton planting team in the late-stage management of cotton fields. This method prevents boll rot, increases the preservation of autumn bolls and autumn buds, and strives to promote early boll opening.

　　From mid-August to early September, the area experienced eighteen consecutive days of showers, and the climate was cold and hot at times, changing erratically. Some cotton fields accumulated water, and cotton plants experienced undesirable phenomena such as excessive growth, lushness, bud drop, boll drop, and boll rot. Therefore, changing the unfavorable conditions brought about by the cloudy and rainy weather, preventing moldy and rotten bolls, striving for more autumn buds, more autumn bolls, and ensuring that autumn buds and autumn bolls do not fall off and open early became the key to late-stage cotton field management. Zhang Qiuxiang led her team members into the fields in the rain to explore countermeasures and adopted a cotton farming method that combined promotion and control, which achieved very good results: eight mu of high-yielding cotton did not continue to experience bud and boll drop, old boll rot, excessive growth, or lushness. Every cotton plant was covered in autumn bolls, and autumn buds appeared and grew constantly.

　　The Shuangwang Management Area Party General Branch promptly convened all cotton planting team leaders and technicians in the management area to visit and learn from Zhang Qiuxiang's cotton planting team's cotton fields and promoted their experience. In the late-stage management of cotton fields, the Zhangjia Production Team followed Zhang Qiuxiang's experience and adopted the method of promoting first and then controlling for 64 mu of cotton fields. They universally applied foliar phosphorus fertilizer to the cotton plants, sprayed six jin of ammonium sulfate per mu, and carried out inter-tillage and weeding to prevent pests, promoting the formation of more autumn buds and more autumn bolls. At the same time, they effectively controlled the phenomenon of excessive cotton plant growth, bud and boll drop, and excessive growth after concentrated water and fertilizer supply, allowing the cotton plants to develop normally. Now, each plant has three or four autumn bolls and three to five flower buds. In the discussion of promoting Zhang Qiuxiang's experience, the members of the Luoliu Production Team realized the great potential for increasing production in Category 3 cotton fields. Therefore, they braved the rain to collect quick-acting fertilizer for the cotton and rushed to apply a fertilizer to increase buds and bolls to 170 mu of Category 3 fields. At the same time, they carried out inter-tillage, weeding, pruning, and foliar phosphorus spraying, which greatly changed the appearance of the Category 3 seedlings. Each plant now has an average of five to seven flower buds and one to two autumn bolls.

　　Now, the members of the entire management area are continuing to strengthen the late-stage management of cotton fields, striving for more autumn bolls.

　　在不利气温下大抓棉田后期管理
　　双王管理区推广张秋香经验
    本报西安二十三日电　陕西省渭南县城关公社双王管理区，大力推广了张秋香植棉组在棉田后期管理中创造的促进与控制结合的培育方法，防止烂桃，增保秋桃、秋蕾，力促早日吐絮。
    从八月中旬到九月上旬，这个地区接连十八天下了阵雨，气候也时冷时热，变化无常。部分棉田积水，棉花发生陡长、贪青、落蕾、落铃、烂桃等不良现象。因此，改变阴雨带来的不利条件，防止霉烂桃，争取多现秋蕾、多结秋桃和保证秋蕾、秋桃不脱落、早吐絮，成为棉田后期管理中的关键。张秋香带领组员们冒雨到田间探索对策，采取了促进与控制相结合的务棉方法，收到了很好的效果：八亩丰产棉未继续发生落蕾落铃、老桃霉烂和陡长、贪青等现象，株株棉花秋桃盖顶，秋蕾也时现时生。
    双王管理区党总支及时召集全管区植棉组长和技术人员等，到张秋香植棉组的棉田里参观、学习，推广了她们的经验。张家生产队在棉田后期管理中，按照张秋香的经验，对六十四亩棉田采取了先促进后控制的方法，普遍给棉株进行了一次根外喷磷，每亩喷打硫酸铵六斤，并中耕除草，防治虫害，促使多结秋蕾、多座秋桃。同时，有效控制了水肥集中供给以后棉株生长过猛，发生蕾铃脱落、陡长的现象，使棉株正常发育，现在每株已座秋桃三、四个，还有花蕾三、五个。罗刘生产队社员在讨论推广张秋香经验中，认识到三类棉田的增产潜力很大，于是冒雨给棉花搜积速效肥，给一百七十亩三类田抢施了一次增蕾增桃肥。同时，进行了中耕除草，整枝打杈和根外喷磷，使三类苗大变样，每株平均结花蕾五到七个；座住秋桃一到二个。
    现在全管区的社员还在继续加强棉田后期管理，力争多结秋桃。
