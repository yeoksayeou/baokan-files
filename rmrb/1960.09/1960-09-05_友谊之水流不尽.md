    The Water of Friendship Flows Endlessly
    Xia Lie

    The sky, it hadn't rained for so long. The fields of the Qianjin Production Team were cracked with drought. The cotton and sorghum were scorched yellow, and the newly planted late rice hadn't even taken root before being baked hard as iron.
    The commune members were engaged in a tense battle with the drought demon. The creaking of waterwheels and the shouts of the people never ceased, echoing across the fields day and night…
    The other teams in this brigade, with their convenient water sources, could easily solve their problems; only the Xianfeng Team was blocked by a high mountain in front of them, preventing the water of the Wild Grass Lake from reaching them. To irrigate the fields, they had to draw water up the mountain. So they became the Qianjin Brigade's anti-drought "obstacle." The team committee decided to first disperse forces to solve the easier problems, and then concentrate forces to solve this difficult one.
    When Brigade Leader Xu Xin led the anti-drought team to the Xianfeng Team to fight a decisive battle, he suddenly discovered that the fields of this team were filled with water everywhere. The late rice, cotton, and beans had all turned a vibrant green, presenting a completely different scene. The commune members were stunned by this. As everyone was wondering, suddenly they heard Captain Xu shout, "Come and see! There's a wooden sign here!" The wooden sign read "Water of Friendship" in large characters, and below it was signed: All the workers of the Coking Plant.
    The commune members all crowded to the Coking Plant construction site, tightly grasping the workers' hands, expressing thanks and greetings. Some commune members rushed to help screen coal, wash coal, and transport coal. Captain Xu found Comrade Chen Shi, the Party Branch Secretary of the Coking Plant, in the crowd, grasped his hand tightly, and said excitedly: "Why, you didn't even say a word! How can we thank you enough?!"
    "No thanks are needed, the workers and peasants are one family! As for not telling you beforehand? This was everyone's idea, they wanted to act first and report later!"
    It turned out that Comrade Chen Shi, the Party Branch Secretary of the Coking Plant near the Xianfeng Team, had been feeling quite bad these days, seeing the late rice of the Xianfeng Team withering day by day. He thought: Now is the time when every drop of water and every grain of rice counts, we must help our farmer brothers to the best of our ability! One morning, as he was walking along the field ridges of the Xianfeng Team, thinking and pacing back and forth, he went up a hill on the opposite side to look out. Facing the green water of the Wild Grass Lake, his mood suddenly brightened. He immediately went back to find the Youth Shock Team Leader Xiao Zhang, the electrical and mechanical worker Xiao Qin, and several work squad leaders to discuss.
      "This is easy, just move the water pump and motor to the lakeside, connect the high-voltage line, and install the water pipes used for pumping water to wash coal, and the problem is solved!" Xiao Qin eagerly voiced his opinion.
    "Good! Agreed! Agreed!" Everyone chimed in with agreement!
    That night, Chen Shi and the shock team members, together, carried the motor, water pump, and water pipes, heave-hoing all the way to the lakeside. After a fierce battle, everything was arranged, Xiao Qin nimbly turned on the electric switch, and the motor and water pump started to rotate with a "hum." The sprinkler head of the water pipe sucked in the green lake water, and through the long water pipe, surged up the high mountain, and flowed into the rice paddies and cotton fields of the Xianfeng Team along the newly opened drainage ditch.
    After the task was completed, Chen Shi nailed the wooden sign he had written in advance on the edge of the field. It read: "Water of Friendship", with the postscript "From all the workers of the Coking Plant." In the middle, he also inscribed a poem:
    The crescent moon shines over the nine provinces,
    By the Wild Grass Lake, we draw water.
    The water of friendship flows endlessly,
    Workers and peasants work together to reap a bumper harvest.

    友谊之水流不尽
    夏烈
    天，好久没下雨了。前进生产队的田地，旱得发裂，棉花、高粱，被烈日烤得秆黄叶焦，刚插下的晚稻，还没有复脚，就晒得硬梆梆的了。
    社员们正在同旱魔作紧张的战斗。水车的辘辘声，人群的嗬呵声，日夜不息，响彻原野……
    这个大队的其他几个小队，水源便利，都容易解决；只有先锋小队，因为面前有一座高山，荒草湖的水给挡住了，要灌田就得引水上山。所以他们成了前进大队的抗旱“关”了。队委会决定，先分散兵力解决易歼队，然后再集中兵力解决这个难歼队。
    当大队长徐新带着抗旱队伍来到先锋小队打歼灭战的时候，突然发现这个小队的田里、地里，到处灌满了水，晚稻、棉花、豆子的颜色，都变得青蔚蔚的，呈现在眼前的却是另一番景象。社员们面对这情景，楞住了。当大家正在纳闷的时候，忽然听到徐队长喊：“来看啦！这里有块木牌！”那木牌上写着“友谊之水”四个大字，下面署名是：炼焦厂全体职工。
    社员们一齐拥到炼焦厂工地，紧握着工人们的手，道谢，致意。有的社员抢上去帮助筛煤、洗煤、运煤。徐队长在人群中找着炼焦厂党支部书记陈实同志，一把握住他的手，激动地说：“怎么，连说也不说声啦！我们要怎样感谢才好呢？！”
    “什么感谢也不要，工农是一家嘛！至于事先不告诉你们吗？这是大家的主意，他们要先斩后奏！”
    原来，先锋小队附近的炼焦厂党支部书记陈实同志，这些天来，看到先锋小队的晚稻一天比一天枯萎的时候，心里挺难受。心想：现在是碗水碗粮的时候，我们要帮助农民兄弟尽一臂之力呀！一天上午，他在路过先锋小队的田塍上，想着走着，踱来踱去，又顺道跑上对面的一座山丘上了望，面对着荒草湖的碧水，心情豁然舒畅起来。他回来马上找青年突击队长小张、机电工小秦和几个工班班长研究。
      “这好办，把水泵、马达抬到湖边，接上高压线，再安上抽水洗煤的皮水管，就解决了问题！”小秦抢先说了自己的意见。
    “好！同意！同意！”大家不约而同地你一句、我一句，都赞成这样干！
    晚上，陈实和突击队员们一起，抬着马达、水泵、皮水管，吚嗬嗨嗬地赶到了湖边。经过一场激烈的战斗，一切都摆布停当了，小秦敏捷地打开电动开关，马达、水泵便“嗡”的一声旋转开了。水管的莲蓬头在嘟嘟地吸着碧绿的湖水，通过长长的水管，翻上了高山，顺着新开的流水沟，涌进了先锋队的稻田、棉地。
    任务完成以后，陈实把事先写好的木牌钉在田边上。上写：“友谊之水”，下款是炼焦厂全体职工启。中间还题了一首诗：
    月儿弯弯照九洲，
    荒草湖边把水抽。
    友谊之水流不尽，
    工农比翼夺丰收。
