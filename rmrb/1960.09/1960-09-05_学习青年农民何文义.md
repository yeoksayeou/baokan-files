Learning from Young Farmer He Wenyi
Commentator of this newspaper

He Wenyi, a young farmer from Duanjia Commune in Dali County, Shaanxi Province, who only had half a year of junior high school education, was still a young farmer who couldn't even recognize chemical symbols two years ago. However, after diligent efforts, he has now become a local expert who has successfully trial-produced 117 kinds of chemical fertilizers, bacterial fertilizers, pesticides, and other chemical crafts, and leads a Communist Youth League chemical factory. Why was He Wenyi able to master science and technology so quickly and make outstanding contributions to the socialist construction of the motherland's rural areas? This is primarily due to the Party and the masses' infinite care and support for him. When He Wenyi started the local chemical fertilizer factory, some people looked down on this dilapidated factory, but the Party branch led everyone in discussions to strengthen their confidence. When they had difficulties in sourcing raw materials (bones) for making fertilizer, the township Party committee organized a "Support the Chemical Fertilizer Factory" campaign. When he went to Dali Agricultural School to learn how to make bacterial fertilizer but was not accepted, the Party committee came forward to help him and wrote him a letter of introduction. When their work was successful, the county Party committee held a meeting to discuss their work, enthusiastically supported them, and widely promoted their experience. Under the call of the Party, the masses also tried every means to provide them with assistance. This fully encouraged He Wenyi's lofty aspirations to build a new socialist countryside, his revolutionary spirit of not fearing hardship and difficulty, and his perseverance in diligently studying culture and science, and he was trained to become one of the thousands of advanced young farmers.

When He Wenyi set up three iron pots under the stage of the opera house in Duanjia Commune, Dali County, and started to cook granular fertilizer and local urea, he regarded it as a glorious undertaking. When a youth from a well-to-do middle peasant family complained about the smell and dirt, saying, "What future is there in this?" He Wenyi firmly said, "My future is here!" In He Wenyi's eyes, a pile of manure and three broken pots could be used to do a great job in developing agricultural production. His idea is very correct and practical, because to build the "poor and blank" Chinese countryside into the most beautiful and best modern countryside, we can only start from the actual conditions of "poor and blank," empty-handed, creating careers from scratch, from small to large. Skyscrapers also start from the ground up. Only when thousands of people start from our existing conditions, establish lofty aspirations, and work hard, can we have a prosperous and strong New China, and can we have a bright and splendid personal future. He Wenyi devoted himself wholeheartedly to the task assigned to him by the Party. He combined the construction of the countryside with his own future, and he combined the future of the motherland with his own future. His mind was filled with the spirit of serving the people and infinitely beautiful ideals, and he was determined to make contributions with all his strength. This sincere dedication to the cause of building a new countryside and lofty aspirations is the most important condition for He Wenyi's ability to achieve today's achievements.

To start a career empty-handed, from scratch, and from small to large, means that one must dare to think, dare to speak, and dare to act, dare to overcome a series of difficulties, dare to carry out a series of creations and experiments, and have a revolutionary spirit of not fearing hardship, not fearing difficulties, working hard, and being indomitable. As many of our workers and peasants have said: if difficulty is the first thing you see, you will not be able to move an inch; if action is the first thing you see, you can travel a thousand miles in a day. With the leadership of the Party and the support of the masses, as long as we work earnestly, have courage and resourcefulness, have drive and methods, any difficulty can be overcome. With this spirit, one will not shrink back in the face of "poverty and blankness," but will regard it as a good opportunity to make a difference and show one's skills. He Wenyi is a person with this spirit. In the process of establishing the chemical fertilizer factory, he really didn't know how many difficulties he encountered, but the difficulties were overcome one by one. When there were not enough bones for making local fertilizer, they found them on the edge of high mountains and in ancient abandoned wells. When there was no foreign equipment for trial-producing bacterial fertilizer, they used local equipment to replace it. This spirit of perseverance and hard work is always necessary and valuable for a revolutionary.

To build a beautiful socialist and communist new countryside, it is necessary to implement the technical transformation of agriculture and gradually modernize agriculture. To realize this grand ideal, we need to study diligently and master scientific and cultural knowledge. The Party places this hope on our young people. At present, there are not many young people in our rural areas who have received higher or secondary education. Aspiring young people must study hard in their spare time and try every means to conquer the scientific and cultural fortress. He Wenyi only had half a year of junior high school education, and "science" was like a mountain blocking his way forward. However, he was not intimidated by difficulties. The Party's trust and hope in him, the needs of the people, and the lofty ideals of communism became the driving force for him to overcome difficulties and study tenaciously. He was very busy with work, so he squeezed in time to study in his spare time; if he had things to do during the day, he would take time to study at night; when he went to the city, he went to Xinhua Bookstore to study. Finally, in a short period of two years, he learned a lot of scientific knowledge.

In order to build a socialist and communist new countryside, every person and every young person must do their best to make more contributions. Let us all learn from He Wenyi's revolutionary spirit! We hope that every rural youth and every young intellectual who goes to work in the countryside will be determined to take root in the countryside for a long time and, under the cultivation of the Party, make a great career in a vigorous manner. Let us dedicate our beautiful youth to the motherland and write a glorious and brilliant chapter in the history of the construction of the new countryside of the motherland.

    学习青年农民何文义
    本报评论员
    陕西大荔县段家公社只念过半年高小的何文义，两年前，还是个连化学符号都认不得的青年农民。可是，他经过了刻苦努力，现在已成为试制成功了一百一十七种化肥、菌肥、农药及其他化学工艺品，并且领导着一座共青团化工厂的土专家了。何文义为什么能够这样迅速地掌握了科学技术，为祖国农村社会主义建设事业作出出色的贡献呢？这首先是由于党和群众对他的无限关怀和支持。在何文义开始办土化肥厂时，有人看不上这个破烂厂子，党支部就领导大家讨论，坚定了大家的信心；在他们制作化肥用的原材料（骨头）的来源有了困难时，乡党委就组织了“支援化肥厂”的运动；在他去大荔农校学习制作细菌肥料未被收留时，党委又出来帮助他，给他们写了介绍信；在他们的工作有了成绩时，县委开会讨论了他们的工作，热情地支持他们，普遍推广了他们的经验。群众在党的号召下，也多方设法给他们以援助。这就使何文义建设祖国新农村的雄心壮志，不畏艰险困苦、百折不挠的革命干劲，坚韧不拔、刻苦钻研文化、科学的毅力得到了充分的鼓励，锻炼成为千千万万先进青年农民中的一个。
    大荔县段家公社的戏楼底下搭起三口铁锅，动手熬制颗粒肥料和土尿素时，何文义就把它当作一项光荣的事业。当富裕中农出身的一个青年嫌臭、嫌脏，说“这会有什么前途”的时候，何文义坚定地说：“我的前途就在这里！”一片大粪、三口烂锅在何文义看来，就能为发展农业生产干一番大好事业。他的想法是很正确很切实的，因为要把“一穷二白”的中国农村建设成最美最好的现代农村，只能从“一穷二白”的实际条件出发，赤手空拳，从无到有，从小到大地创立事业。万丈高楼也是从平地起的，只有千千万万的人，个个都从我们现有的条件开始，树立起雄心壮志，埋头苦干，才能有富强的新中国，才能有个人的光辉灿烂的前途。何文义满怀热情全神贯注于党交给他的任务。他把建设农村和自己的前途结合在一起，他把祖国的前途和自己的前途结合在一起。在他的头脑里充满了为人民服务的精神和无限美好的理想，他决心竭尽全力作出贡献来。这种赤诚的建设新农村的事业心和雄心壮志，是何文义能够取得今天的成就的最重要的条件。
    赤手空拳、从无到有、从小到大地创立事业，就意味着必须有敢想敢说敢干，敢于去克服一系列的困难，敢于去进行一系列的创造和试验，不畏艰险、不怕困苦、埋头苦干、百折不挠的革命干劲。正如我们许多工人、农民所说的：难字当头，就会寸步难行；干字当头，就能一日千里。我们有党的领导，有群众的支持，只要切切实实地干，有勇又有谋，有干劲又有办法，任何困难都是可以克服的。具备了这样的精神，就不会在
  “一穷二白”面前畏缩起来，而是把它看成是大有作为，大显身手的好时机。何文义就是具有这种精神的人。他在创办化工厂的过程中，真不知碰到多少困难，但是困难一个个被克服了。当制作土化肥用的骨头不够时，他们从高山边上，古废井里找到了。在试制细菌肥料没有洋设备时，他们就用土设备来代替。这种百折不挠、苦干实干的精神，对一个革命者来说永远是必要而且可贵的。
    要建设一个美丽的社会主义、共产主义的新农村，必须实行农业的技术改造，使农业逐步现代化。要实现这个远大的理想，需要我们刻苦地进行学习，掌握科学文化知识。党，把这个希望寄托在我们青年人的身上。目前，我国农村受过高等或中等教育的青年还不太多，有志气的青年必须在业余刻苦学习，千方百计地去攻克科学文化堡垒。何文义只念过半年高小，“科学”就像一座大山挡住他的前进道路，但是，他没有被困难吓倒。党对他的信任和希望，人民的需要，共产主义的远大理想，成为促使他克服困难顽强地进行学习的动力。他工作很忙，就挤业余时间学；白天有事，就抽黑夜学；进城，就到新华书店去学，终于在短短的两年时间中，学会了不少科学知识。
    为了建设社会主义、共产主义的新农村，每一个人、每一个青年都要尽力作出更多的贡献。让我们都来学习何文义的革命精神吧！我们希望每一个农村青年，每一个到农村去工作的青年知识分子，要决心长期在农村生根立足，在党的培育下，轰轰烈烈地干出一番事业来。把我们美丽的青春献给祖国，在祖国新农村建设史上写下光辉灿烂的篇章。
