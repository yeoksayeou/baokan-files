　　Xinhua News Agency, Johannesburg, 27th: Despite the South African authorities' suppression and persecution, the South African African National Congress has recently secretly distributed leaflets, calling on the people to launch national demonstrations from October 1st to oppose the racially discriminatory "pass laws."

　　In the leaflets, the South African African National Congress also opposes the "referendum" planned by the South African Verwoerd government for October 15th to establish a fascist republic.

　　As everyone knows, the South African people launched large-scale demonstrations against the "pass laws" in March and April of this year. The South African African National Congress has been banned from activities by the authorities since then. However, this nationalist organization has established an emergency committee to continue the struggle.

　　There are also reports that although the South African authorities recently announced the cancellation of the "state of emergency," they are still continuing to brutally suppress the people. Recently, twelve members of the banned Pan-Africanist Congress were arrested for distributing leaflets. At the same time, on the 21st and 26th, the South African authorities also dispatched police to raid the Johannesburg office of the South African Congress of Trade Unions, confiscating all records, trade union membership cards, and other documents.

　  南非非洲人国民大会秘密散发传单
　　号召全国示威反对种族歧视
    新华社27日讯　约翰内斯堡消息：南非非洲人国民大会不顾南非当局的镇压和迫害，最近秘密散发传单，号召人民从10月1日起展开全国性的示威，反对种族歧视的“通行证法”。
    南非非洲人国民大会在传单中还反对南非维沃尔德政府为建立法西斯式的共和国而计划在10月15日举行的“公民投票”。
    大家知道，今年3、4月间南非人民曾掀起反对“通行证法”的大示威。南非非洲人国民大会自那时起一直被当局禁止活动。但是，这个民族主义组织成立了紧急委员会，继续进行斗争。
    还有消息说，南非当局最近虽然宣布取消“紧急状态”，但是仍在继续野蛮镇压人民。最近，有十二名被取缔的泛非主义者大会的成员就因散发传单而被逮捕。同时，南非当局在21日和26日还曾先后出动警察袭击了南非工会大会在约翰内斯堡的办公处，劫走了办公处的所有记录、工会会员证和其他文件。
