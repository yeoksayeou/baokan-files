　　Sea Eagle

　　The "Lu Jian 101" cargo ship, sailing on the Qingdao-Lanshan Head route, is like a sea eagle, braving wind and rain, transporting ore to small blast furnaces day and night.

　　One day, the "101" cargo ship was approaching Lanshan Head when suddenly the wind howled, the waves surged, and a force six southeasterly wind swept across the sea. Waves several meters high violently crashed against the hull. Anyone who has traveled this route knows that Lanshan Head, a natural harbor, has three-foot waves even without wind, and a force three southerly wind makes it impossible to approach the shore. Old sailors often say, "One can travel ten thousand miles, but not stop at Lanshan Head." With a force six wind, how could they possibly dock? Captain Wang Shulin and Second Mate Zhang Benzao were studying ways to dock when the telegraph operator brought a telegram from the Qingdao Maritime Bureau: if you can't dock, seek shelter in Lianyungang. But sheltering from the wind would mean missing the tide and affecting a voyage, resulting in a loss of 1,300 tons of ore. How could they allow that? The crew was determined to fight the waves and ensure a safe docking. They adopted a "seeing-the-seam" method, following the wave's momentum, concentrating their efforts, and maneuvering the barges to dock one by one. As a result, the giant waves bowed their heads, and the barges finally reached the dock. "The ship docks, the cargo goes on board." From the crew to the helmsman, the entire team worked together, and in three hours, three barges were fully loaded, increasing the loading speed by nearly double compared to the past.

　　As the tide receded, a "long dragon" of barges closely followed the "Lu Jian 101" cargo ship, riding the wind and waves towards Qingdao. (Island)

　　海上雄鹰
    航行在青岛—岚山头航线上的鲁建一零一号货运船，像一只海上雄鹰，风雨无阻，一天不停地为小高炉赶运矿石。
    一天，一零一号货运船快靠近岚山头了，忽然风声呼啸，巨浪滔滔，海面上刮起了六级东南风，丈把巨浪猛烈地冲击着船身。走过这条航线的人都知道，岚山头这个天然港，无风三尺浪，三级南风就靠不上岸。老船员常说：“能行万里航线，不在岚山头站一站。”六级大风，怎么能靠岸呢？船长王树林和二副张本藻，正在研究靠岸的办法，报务员送来了青岛海运局的电报：靠不上岸可到连云港避风。可是避风就要错过潮期，影响一个航次，就要少运一千三百吨矿石，那怎么能行呢？船员们决心同海浪搏斗，非安全靠岸不可。他们采用了见缝插针的办法，顺着浪势，集中力量，使驳船分只靠岸。结果巨浪低头了，一只只驳船终于靠上了码头。“船靠岸，货上船”。从船员到舵手，全班人马齐上阵，三个小时，三只驳船就满载了，装船速度比过去提高近一倍。
    当潮水刚刚回落的时候，一行“长龙”似的驳船，紧紧随在鲁建一零一号货运船的后边，乘风破浪向青岛驶去。　（岛）
