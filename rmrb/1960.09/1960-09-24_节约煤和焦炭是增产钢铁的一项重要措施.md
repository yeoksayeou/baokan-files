　　Coal is the "grain" of the iron and steel industry. With coal, there is iron; with iron, there is steel. The more coal production increases, especially coking coal, the more guaranteed is a substantial increase in steel production. But this is only one aspect. Another aspect, equally important as increasing coal production, is conserving coal. By making every effort to conserve coal and coke, and reduce the coal consumption per ton of pig iron, especially pig iron produced in small blast furnaces, we can produce more pig iron with the same amount of coal. More pig iron production creates the most important conditions for increasing steel production. Opening up new sources and reducing consumption must go hand in hand to achieve more significant results in increasing steel production.
    Why does conserving coke have such a positive significance for increasing steel production? The main raw materials for ironmaking are ore and coke. Iron is made in blast furnaces. Regardless of whether it is a large or small blast furnace, the volume of the furnace is limited. Using more coke means less ore can be loaded, and less iron is produced. Conversely, the less coke used, the more ore that can be loaded, and the more pig iron that can be produced. According to general estimates, if small blast furnaces across the country can save 0.3 tons of coke per ton of iron produced on the existing basis, approximately more than 10,000 tons of coke can be saved per day. In the coming nearly one hundred days, more than one million tons of coke can be saved. With this more than one million tons of coke, approximately one million tons more pig iron can be produced. This one million tons of pig iron can then be used to produce 800,000 to 1 million tons of steel. Therefore, it can be said that conserving coke means increasing steel production. Moreover, 80% of the sulfur content in pig iron comes from coke. Less coke used also means less sulfur in the pig iron, improving the quality of the pig iron. At the same time, coke is a major factor in the cost of pig iron. Less coke used means lower pig iron production costs. Therefore, conserving coke is directly related to the realization of the overall leap forward plan for high quality, high yield, and low cost steel. The iron and steel industry is the largest consumer of coal. If we can produce the most pig iron with the least coke, we can better support the coal needs of all sectors of the economy, which also relates to the overall national economy. It is clear that conserving coke is not a trivial matter that can be emphasized or ignored, but a very important and active measure to increase steel production.
    Can small blast furnaces save a large amount of coke? Yes! Please see the example of the Jielong Iron Plant in Ba County, Chongqing, published in today's newspaper. The Jielong Iron Plant is an ordinary small ironmaking enterprise. This year, they have made every effort to conserve coke. The waste rate of coke before entering the furnace has been reduced from over 30% in the past to 15%, and the coke ratio before entering the furnace has been maintained at over 700 kilograms. Based on this estimate, the plant can produce more than 4,200 tons of pig iron this year by saving more than 3,000 tons of coke. A small ironmaking enterprise can play such a large role after conserving coke. If thousands upon thousands of small ironmaking enterprises across the country can reach the level of the Jielong Iron Plant in Ba County, what a great contribution that would be to increasing steel production! Currently, the total coke ratio (i.e., the total coke required to produce one ton of iron, including losses before entering the furnace) of small and medium-sized blast furnaces in various provinces and cities is generally as low as 1,200 to 1,300 kilograms, and the coke ratio before entering the furnace (i.e., the coke used to produce one ton of iron, excluding losses before entering the furnace) is generally as low as 800 to 900 kilograms, while the total coke ratio can reach around 2,000 kilograms, and the coke ratio before entering the furnace can reach 1,300 to 1,400 kilograms. The furnaces are of the same type, and the conditions are generally similar, but the coke ratios differ so greatly. Doesn't this show that there is great potential to be tapped in conserving coke?
    There is great potential to conserve coke. Is there any special trick to tapping this potential? Actually, no. If there must be one, it is to fully mobilize the masses and do a series of tasks meticulously and conscientiously. From the perspective of ideological understanding, we must educate all employees on the iron and steel front to firmly establish the idea of building the country and running enterprises with diligence and thrift. We must be good at using the method of detailed accounting to make the employees understand the important relationship between conserving coke and promoting steel production and the continuous leap forward of the national economy. We must establish the comprehensive view that to increase steel production, we must vigorously conserve coke, thereby turning the conservation of coke into a conscious action of every employee. And on this basis, deeply and persistently carry out mass movements to conserve coke.
    Having a correct understanding ideologically creates the prerequisite for conserving coal and coke, but it does not mean that coke can be conserved. To actually use less coke and produce more iron, we must take effective measures in every link from raw coal to coke entering the furnace. Otherwise, it is still impossible to use less coke and produce more iron. Turning raw coal into coke is the first barrier to saving coal. From the perspective of the coking department, in addition to paying attention to saving raw coal in links such as transportation, the most important thing is to try every means to reduce coal consumption in the processing process and improve the quality of coke. What needs to be particularly emphasized here is that coal that has not been washed must not be used for coking. Countless experiences have proven that raw coal can remove most of the ash and sulfur content after washing and selecting before coking, and for every 1% reduction in the ash content of coke, the consumption of coke can be reduced by 1.7% during ironmaking, and the production of high-quality iron can be increased by 2% to 2.5% accordingly. As for reducing the sulfur content of coke, it can greatly improve the quality of pig iron, which is also known to everyone. Improving the quality of coke and having good strength can also reduce the production of coke powder, ensuring that more lump coke directly enters the furnace for ironmaking. In addition to saving primary coking coal, producing more coke, and producing good coke, the employees of the coking department should also pay attention to opening up sources of coal for coking and learn to use lean coal, lignite, and other non-primary coking coal to produce good coke.
    The ironmaking department is the department that directly uses coke and is the key link in conserving coke. For the employees of this department, the most important task is to try every means to reduce the coke ratio and strive to produce more good iron with the same amount of coke. However, only paying attention to reducing the coke ratio before entering the furnace is unscientific and cannot show the full effect of conservation. Whether a small blast furnace conserves coke mainly depends on whether its total coke ratio is low, because the loss of coke before entering the furnace is quite large, so the potential for conservation is also very large, especially since most people often do not pay much attention to reducing the loss of coke before entering the furnace. Therefore, we must further emphasize this aspect of conservation. Reducing the loss of coke before entering the furnace is key to strengthening the management of coke, that is, managing the links of coke crushing, transportation, loading and unloading, storage, and recycling. Many enterprises have also gained many good experiences in these areas, such as mobilizing the masses to carry out technological innovation and technological revolution, further improving coke crushing tools and crushing methods, improving transportation and loading and unloading methods, minimizing the number of transportation and loading and unloading losses; in the storage process, classifying and stacking, setting up material sheds; preventing scattering during use, classifying and using, so that not a single good or bad particle is lost; dividing the coking furnace and coke transportation area into fixed areas with dedicated personnel responsible for regular cleaning and particle recovery, and so on. In short, to be meticulous and down-to-earth, and to do these specific tasks practically and well, so that the total coke ratio can also reach an advanced level, and the conservation of coke can achieve the greatest results.
    Coal is currently the key to increasing steel production. Overcoming this key is not difficult. The method is for employees in the coal department to strive to increase the production of coking coal again and again, and for employees in the metallurgical department to strive to save coal and coke again and again. These two aspects of work, though different paths, lead to the same goal. If both are done well, there will be more certainty in achieving a greater increase in steel production in the fourth quarter.

### 节约煤和焦炭是增产钢铁的一项重要措施

　　节约煤和焦炭是增产钢铁的一项重要措施
    煤炭是钢铁工业的“粮食”。有煤才有铁，有铁才有钢；煤炭增产特别是焦煤增产越多，钢铁大幅度增产就越有保证。但这只是一方面。还有一个与增产煤炭同等重要的方面，这就是节约煤炭。千方百计地节约煤和焦炭，降低每吨生铁特别是小高炉生铁的耗煤量，就能用同样数量的煤，炼出更多的生铁，生铁增产多了，就给增产钢创造了最主要的条件。开源和节流必须并举，才能收到更加显著地增产钢铁的效果。
    节约焦炭对于增产钢铁为什么有这样积极的意义呢？炼铁的主要原料，一是矿石，一是焦炭。铁是用高炉炼出的。而不论大高炉或是小高炉，炉子的容积都是有一定限度的，用的焦炭多了，装的矿石就少了，出的铁也就少了。反过来，焦炭用得越少，装的矿石越多，就可能炼出更多的生铁。据一般的估算，全国小高炉如果能够在现有基础上，每炼一吨铁节约零点三吨焦炭，一天约可节约一万多吨焦炭，今后近一百天内，就可以节约一百多万吨焦炭；用这一百多万吨焦炭，就可以再增产一百万吨左右的生铁；这一百万吨左右的生铁，又可炼八十万至一百万吨钢。因此，可以这样说：节约焦炭就意味着增产钢铁。不仅如此，生铁中含的硫分，80％是焦炭带来的，焦炭用得少，生铁中的硫分也会随之减少，生铁质量就能提高。同时，焦炭是构成生铁成本一个主要因素，焦炭用得少，生铁的成本就低。因此，节约焦炭，直接关系着钢铁的优质、高产、低成本等全面跃进计划的实现。钢铁企业是用煤最多的部门，如果能够用最少的焦炭炼出最多的生铁，还可以更好地支援各行各业用煤的需要，即又关系着整个国民经济的全局。可见，节约焦炭不是一件可以重视也可以不重视的小事，而是一项增产钢铁的十分重要的积极措施。
    小高炉能不能大量节约焦炭呢？能！请看今天本报发表的重庆巴县接龙铁厂的事例。接龙铁厂是个普通的小型炼铁企业，他们今年千方百计节约焦炭，焦炭入炉前的浪费率由过去30％以上降到15％，入炉焦比保持在七百多公斤。据此估算，全厂今年用节约出来的三千多吨焦炭就可以多炼四千二百多吨生铁。一个小型炼铁企业节约焦炭后，就能发挥这样大的作用，全国成千上万个小型炼铁企业如果都能达到巴县接龙铁厂的水平，那对于钢铁增产该有多么大的贡献啊！现在全国各省市中小高炉的全焦比，（即炼一吨铁所需要的包括入炉前损耗在内的全部焦炭）一般低的只有一千二、三百公斤，入炉焦比（即炼一吨铁除去入炉前的损耗所用的焦炭。）一般低的只有八、九百公斤，而全焦比高的则达到两千公斤左右，入炉焦比高的则达一千三、四百公斤。同样类型的炉子，条件也大体相同，而焦比相差却这样悬殊，不正说明节约焦炭大有潜力可挖吗？
    节约焦炭的潜力很大，要把这种潜力挖掘出来有什么特别的妙诀吗？其实也没有，如果一定要说有的话，只有一条，这就是充分发动群众，细致踏实地做好一系列的工作。从思想认识来说，要教育钢铁战线上的全体职工牢固地树立起勤俭建国、勤俭办企业的思想，要善于用算细账的办法，使职工们明确节约焦炭对促进钢铁增产、促进国民经济持续跃进的重大关系，树立起要增产钢铁就要大力节约焦炭的全面观点，从而把节约焦炭变成每个职工的自觉行动。并在这个基础上，深入地持久地大搞节约焦炭的群众运动。
    思想上有了正确认识，为节约煤和焦炭创造了前提，但并不等于就能节约焦炭，要在实际上做到少用焦，多产铁，还必须从原煤炼焦到焦炭入炉的每个环节上，都采取切实有效的措施，否则，仍然不可能做到少用焦，多产铁。把原煤炼成焦，是节约煤的第一道关口。从炼焦部门来说，除了在运输等环节注意节约原煤外，最重要的是要在加工过程中，千方百计降低煤的消耗，提高焦炭的质量。这里要特别强调的是没有洗过的煤一定不要拿去炼焦。无数的经验证明，原煤经过洗选后再炼焦，可以去掉大部分的灰分和硫分，而焦炭中的灰分每降低1％，炼铁时焦炭的消耗就可以降低1.7％，就可以相应地增产2％到2.5％的优质铁。至于降低焦炭的硫分，可以大大提高生铁的质量，这也是大家都知道的。焦炭质量提高，强度好，还可以少产生粉焦，保证有更多的块焦直接入炉炼铁。炼焦部门的职工除了节约主焦煤，多炼焦、炼好焦外，还要注意开辟炼焦的煤源，学会用瘦煤、褐煤及其他非主焦煤炼成好焦炭。
    炼铁部门是直接使用焦炭的部门，是节约焦炭的关键环节。对于这个部门的职工来说，最主要的任务是千方百计降低焦比，力争用同样数量的焦炭生产出更多的好铁。但是，仅仅注意降低入炉焦比还是不科学的，还是不能看出全部节约成效的。一个小高炉，焦炭是否节约，主要看它的全焦比是不是低，因为焦炭在入炉前的损耗是相当大的，因而节约的潜力也是很大的，特别是一般人往往不大注意减低焦炭入炉前的损耗。所以要更加强调这一方面的节约。降低入炉前的焦炭损耗，关键在于加强焦炭的管理工作，即管好焦炭的破碎、运输、装卸、保管、回收等几个环节。许多企业在这些方面也有了许多好的经验，诸如发动群众开展技术革新和技术革命，进一步改进焦炭的破碎工具和破碎方法，改进运输和装卸方法，尽量减少运输次数和装卸损耗；在保管过程中，分级堆放，设置料棚；使用时防止抛撒，分级使用，做到好劣一粒不丢；焦炉和运焦划区固定专人负责，定期清理，颗粒回收，等等。总之，要细致踏实，不避艰苦地把这些具体工作都切切实实做好，才能使全焦比也能达到先进的水平，节约焦炭才能收到最大的效果。
    煤，是当前增产钢铁的关键，攻克这个关键也是并不难的，办法是煤炭部门职工力争焦煤增产再增产，冶金部门职工力争煤、焦节约再节约，殊途同归，这两方面的工作都办好了，在第四季度，实现钢铁更大幅度的增产就更有把握了。
