Henan Exceeds焦Coal Production in Third Quarter

Priority Given to Building焦Coal Mines; Province Has Basically Achieved Goal of Having焦Coal Mines Wherever There Are Steel Plants

(Our report) The coal mine workers in Henan Province, in the movement to increase production and practice economy, have been focusing on increasing the production of焦coal and enthusiastically launching a high-quality and high-yield competition for焦coal. The production plan for the third quarter of焦coal was completed ahead of schedule on September 11. The daily output level of焦coal increased by 12.1% compared to the first half of the year.

Based on the province's abundant焦coal resources and its proximity to the Wuhan Iron and Steel Base, the Henan Provincial Coal Industry Department has prioritized the construction of焦coal mines. For example, this year, 69.6% of the province's capital construction investment in coal mines was used for焦coal mines. As a result,焦coal accounts for 77% of the planned new mine capacity for the year, and焦coal mines account for 70% of the new mines planned to be put into production this year. Currently, five pairs of焦coal mines have been put into production ahead of schedule. To quickly leverage the role of these new mines, they have carefully summarized the experience and lessons learned from the production of new mines. They proposed overcoming the old practice that new mines must take six months to reach their designed production level after being put into production. The Luocun Mine in Hebi, which was put into production in June this year, reached its designed level in the first month after being put into production, and exceeded its designed capacity by 68% in three months.

In the development and technological transformation of small coal mines, priority is also given to the development of焦coal mines, in accordance with the principle of "taking steel as the key link." Now, the province has basically achieved the goal of having焦coal mines corresponding to steel plants wherever they are, directly ensuring the焦coal and coke needed by the steel plants.

In order to vigorously increase the production of焦coal, the Party organizations at all levels of the Henan coal mines have paid great attention to educating workers about the significant importance of increasing the production of coal and coke for grain and steel production. For example, they adopted the method of "three looks and three thoughts," that is, looking at the uses of coal and thinking about the relationship between coal and increasing the production of grain and steel; looking at the growth rate of grain and steel and thinking about how to better support agriculture and steel; looking at the country's needs for grain and steel and thinking about the huge role of coal and coke in increasing the production of grain and steel. This closely linked the increase in coal production with the increase in grain and steel production. The workers reflected, "More coal production can lead to more iron production, more steel smelting, and more machinery manufacturing, realizing the technological transformation of agriculture," thus universally launching opponent competitions and counterpart competitions between mines and mines, districts and districts, shifts and shifts, groups and groups, and individuals and individuals. In the competition, everyone was high-spirited and motivated, and adopted the "three implementations" method of implementing the plan to the team, implementing the measures to the work type, and implementing the responsibility to the individual, so that the movement had both a vigorous momentum and solid content, making the competition widespread, in-depth, and long-lasting. Hebi No. 5 Mine completed its plan three days ahead of schedule in August, with a monthly output of more than 28,000 tons from the working face, exceeding the No. 2 Mine in the opponent competition. The second mining area and the advanced first mining area of No. 5 Mine launched a competition, increasing the daily output from 200 tons to 500 tons. In order to always strive for the upper reaches, the first mining area increased its daily output from the original 700 tons to 1,080 tons, achieving high yield.

In the mass movement to increase production and practice economy of焦coal, leaders at all levels went deep into the front line, focused on specific measures, and attacked the key to production. More than 300 cadres at the bureau, department, and mine director levels of coal mines in the province went deep into the mining areas, adopted the method of staying at selected spots to grasp the key and solve specific problems, and led production from production. In order to strengthen the leadership of backward units, the Guanyintang Coal Mine, which produces prime焦coal, recently sent the deputy secretary of the Party committee of the Mining Bureau to the Guanyintang Mine, and the deputy director of the Mining Bureau to the Caoyao Mine as the secretary and director of the mine, and the director of the mine to the coal mining area as the district chief to specifically help the grassroots work. The mines generally established underground offices, with the secretary, mine director, and chief engineer jointly forming a production command team, and leading the responsible comrades from the production planning, material supply, equipment maintenance, and labor wage departments to work in shifts day and night underground, implementing "four similarities" and "five packages" (the five packages include ideological mobilization, solving problems, ensuring safe production, ensuring specifications and quality, and completing the plan), further mobilizing the production enthusiasm of the broad masses. Each member of the Party committee of the Zhugemiao Mine of the Pingdingshan Mining Bureau, as well as the district chief and section chief, was responsible for contracting a group, so they quickly discovered and summarized the experience of the Ma Tiezhu coal mining group, and launched a movement to learn from and catch up with Ma Tiezhu throughout the mine, so that the mine's production level rose step by step, and the monthly tasks were overfulfilled, becoming a mine with better production tasks in the Pingdingshan Mining Bureau.

Now, the coal mines are drumming up greater efforts to strive to overproduce more coal to celebrate National Day, and are preparing for a greater leap forward in the fourth quarter, launching competitions for digging thousands of meters and double thousands of meters, focusing on several major links in coal mine production. At present, 42 rapid tunneling teams have been organized throughout the province. In the rapid tunneling movement to learn from Qi Hezhi and catch up with Qi Hezhi, five double-thousand-meter teams have emerged, greatly improving the tunneling footage of the province. The coal mine's tunneling coal volume has a mineable period of more than four months, and has done a lot of engineering for the opening of new mining areas. (Attached picture)

From January to August, the Jingxing Coal Mine in Hebei Province overfulfilled its plan every month. The average daily output in September increased by 5.71% compared with August, the tunneling footage increased by 20.14%, and the ash content of raw coal was 0.29% lower than the national plan, becoming a red flag among the national coal mines.

　　河南三季度焦煤超产
　　优先建设焦煤矿井，全省已基本做到哪里有钢铁厂哪里就有炼焦煤矿井
    本报讯　河南省各煤矿职工在增产节约运动中，大抓炼焦煤增产，热烈开展炼焦煤优质高产竞赛，第三季度的炼焦煤生产计划已经在9月11日提前完成。炼焦煤日产水平比上半年提高12.1％。
    河南省煤炭工业部门根据本省焦煤资源丰富，而且距离武汉钢铁基地近等特点，首先抓紧焦煤矿井的建设。例如今年全省煤矿的基本建设投资，用于焦煤矿井的即占69.6％，因而在全年计划新建的矿井能力中，焦煤即占77％，全年计划移交生产的新井，焦煤矿井即占70％，现在已有五对焦煤矿井分别提前投入了生产。为了迅速发挥这些新井的作用，他们认真总结了新井生产的经验和教训，提出克服新井在移交生产后，必须六个月才能达到设计生产水平的旧常规，今年6月移交生产的鹤壁罗村矿，在移交后第一个月就达到了设计水平，三个月即超过设计能力68％。
    在小型煤矿的发展和技术改造中，也是根据“以钢为纲”的方针，优先发展炼焦煤矿井。现在全省已基本作到了哪里有钢铁厂，哪里就有炼焦煤矿井与之相对口，直接保证了钢铁厂所需要的焦煤和焦炭。
    为了大力增产炼焦煤，河南煤矿的各级党组织，非常注意对职工进行增产煤焦对粮食钢铁生产的重大意义的教育。例如，他们采取三看三想的办法，三看三想即看煤的用处，想煤和增产粮食、增产钢铁的关系；看粮、钢的增长速度，想如何更好地支援农业、支援钢铁；看国家对粮、钢的需要，想煤焦在增产粮、钢中的巨大作用。这就把增产煤炭和增产粮、钢密切地联系起来。职工们反映：“多出煤，就可以多产铁、多炼钢、多造机械，实现农业技术改造”，从而普遍开展了矿与矿、区与区、班与班、组与组、人与人的对手赛、对口赛。在竞赛中，人人意气风发，个个干劲冲天，并采取计划落实到小组，措施落实到工种，责任落实到个人的“三落实”的办法，使运动既有轰轰烈烈的声势，又有踏踏实实的内容，使竞赛开展得广泛、深入、持久。鹤壁五矿在8月份提前三天完成计划，工作面月产量达到二万八千吨以上，超过对手赛的二矿。五矿的二采区和先进的一采区开展了竞赛，日产量由二百吨提高到五百吨，一采区为了永争上游，由原来的日产七百吨，达到一千零八十吨，实现了高产。
    在大搞炼焦煤的增产节约运动中，各级领导都深入第一线，狠抓具体措施，猛攻生产关键。全省煤矿局、处、矿长级干部三百多人深入采区，采取蹲点的办法抓关键，解决具体问题，从生产中领导生产。生产主焦煤的观音堂煤矿为了加强对后进单位的领导，最近把矿务局的党委副书记下放到观音堂矿，把副局长下放到曹窑矿兼矿上的书记和矿长，把矿长下放到采煤区当区长具体帮助基层工作。各矿普遍建立了井下办公室，以书记、矿长、总工程师共同组成生产指挥小组，并带领生产计划、材料供应、设备维修、劳动工资等部门的负责同志，昼夜分班在井下值班，实行“四同”“五包”（五包即包思想发动、包解决问题、包安全生产、包规格质量、包完成计划），进一步调动了广大群众的生产积极性。平顶山矿务局的诸葛庙矿每一个党委委员以至区长、科长都负责包一个小组，因而很快地发现和总结了马铁柱采煤小组的经验，并在全矿开展了学赶马铁柱运动，使全矿生产水平步步上升，月月超额完成任务，成为平顶山矿务局生产任务较好的一个矿。
    现在，各煤矿一面鼓足更大干劲，争取超产更多的煤炭向国庆节献礼，一面为四季度的更大跃进进行准备，针对煤矿生产中的几个主要环节开展掘进千米、双千米赛。目前，全省已经组织起来四十二个快速掘进队，在学齐合只、赶齐合只的快速掘进运动中，已经出现了五个双千米队，使全省的掘进进尺大大提高，各矿的掘进获得煤量可采期都在四个月以上，并且为新的采区开拓作了很多工程。（附图片）
    河北省井陉煤矿1至8月份，月月全面超额完成计划，9月的平均日产量又比8月份提高5.71％，掘进进尺提高20.14％，原煤灰分比国家计划降低0.29％，成为全国煤矿中的一面红旗。这是一矿党委副书记孙进善（右一）正和二零九青年快速掘进队的工人一起研究改进掏槽方法，保证持续高产　新华社记者　时盘棋摄
