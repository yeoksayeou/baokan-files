The Shanhou Brigade's natural conditions are poor, but cadres lead deeply, resolutely implement policies, and production achieves successive victories.
The Luoyuan Brigade's natural conditions are good, but leadership is laissez-faire, with a failure to prioritize work, resulting in production lagging behind.

(Reported by this newspaper) In the Xiada Commune of Nanping, Fujian, there are two production brigades where significant differences in production exist due to the different leadership styles and methods of the brigade cadres. In the Shanhou Brigade, every rice plant is dark green and vigorous with strong tillering, and there are no weeds in the fields. In the Luoyuan Brigade, the late rice lacks sufficient fertilizer, many rice seedlings are yellowing, weeds are rampant, and some of the middle rice fields look even shorter than the late rice in the Shanhou Brigade.

Is it because the natural conditions of the Shanhou Brigade are better? No. The situation is exactly the opposite: the Shanhou Brigade is located on the top of a high mountain, with steep slopes, inconvenient transportation, scattered fields, a cold climate, and a late crop growing season. The Luoyuan Brigade is at the foot of the mountain, with relatively flat terrain and more concentrated land, making its natural conditions better than those of the Shanhou Brigade. In terms of labor, each laborer in the Shanhou Brigade cultivates an average of 11.8 mu; in the Luoyuan Brigade, each laborer cultivates an average of 9 mu.

The fundamental reason for such a significant disparity in production between these two brigades lies in the leadership style and methods of the brigade cadres.

The Shanhou Brigade Party Branch is resolute and effective in implementing the Party's policy of taking agriculture as the foundation. Once the "Double Rush" (rush harvesting and rush planting) work was deployed, the Party Branch seized the opportunity to convene meetings repeatedly among Party members and the masses, concentrating more than 80% of the brigade's labor force to carry out large-scale rush harvesting and rush planting. The five members of the Party Branch Committee were assigned to lead five production teams, living in the fields, adhering to the front line of production, participating in production, and leading production. Usually, the Party Branch Secretary and cadres at the level of three brigade leaders or above participate in labor an average of more than 22 days a month. Production team leaders, like the commune members, generally labor 28 days a month.

At the beginning of the summer harvest and summer planting, the Party Branch tightly grasped the concentration of labor, but some production teams were slow to implement. The Third Production Team had 29 laborers, but initially only nine were used in harvesting and planting, with the remaining labor force dispersed for forestry harvesting, livestock farms, and other agricultural work. The allocation of labor for major agricultural tasks was also unreasonable. Nine laborers were piled together to share one threshing tool, with some harvesting, some threshing, and some idle. The Branch Secretary, Shan Lianyuan, went deep into this team, discovered this problem, and convened team cadres and the masses to discuss solutions. Labor was immediately drawn from forestry harvesting and logistics departments, and the labor force for summer harvesting and summer planting increased to over 86%. At the same time, the labor organization was adjusted, reducing the number of people using one threshing tool from nine to five, increasing the average daily harvest per person from more than 100 jin to nearly 300 jin. The Party Branch also adopted the method of assigning young and strong laborers to distant fields and old and weak laborers to nearby fields, implementing on-site harvesting, on-site threshing, on-site drying, and on-site delivery, further improving work efficiency. In previous years, the harvested rice from the foot of the mountain had to be carried to the village on the mountain to dry, and then carried back down the mountain to pay public grain, a round trip of twenty to thirty li, wasting a lot of labor. This year, due to on-site harvesting, drying, and delivery, 4,020 workdays were saved.

In grasping livelihood aspects, the Party Branch sent the Finance and Trade Secretary to take charge of the canteen to strengthen leadership and establish vegetable bases, so that commune members could eat their fill, eat well, and eat hygienically. The commune members' production enthusiasm was full, and their drive was very high, making production work proactive and taking the lead in everything.

The Luoyuan Brigade Party Branch's understanding of the Party's policy of taking agriculture as the foundation was unclear, and its actions were not resolute. At the mass meeting to deploy "Double Rush" tasks, the Branch first talked about sanitation work and spare-time education, and then simply deployed the summer harvest and summer planting, failing to prioritize work and reversing priorities. The labor force could not be concentrated for a long time. Of the 139 full male laborers in the brigade, only 64 were used in agricultural production, less than 50%. The rest were used in logging yards, charcoal burning, firewood cutting, and bamboo digging. The progress of harvesting and planting was very slow. It took fifteen days to harvest and plant 163 mu of double-cropped early rice. Due to the lack of labor for late rice transplanting, a large proportion was transplanted at 7x8 inch spacing, failing to meet the standards for reasonable close planting. The quantity and quality of fertilizer were poor. Although this team is not far from Nanping City, it can pick up manure in the city, but because no labor could be spared, only five or six dan of fertilizer were applied per mu. The brigade cadres could not frequently go deep into the front line, participate in production, or lead production. Although the cadres had division of labor, because they did not go deep into production practice, they could not discover problems or solve problems, and the work and production fell into a state of laissez-faire. The Party Branch also did not care enough about the lives of the commune members. The Fourth Production Team canteen fed 86 people, but only planted one mu of vegetables, and because of poor management, the harvest was very small, and vegetable supply could not keep up. Once passive, they were passive at every step. Because the branch leadership was not tightly grasping, the field management has fallen behind other brigades.

Two different leadership styles and methods inevitably lead to two different results in work and production. The Nanping Municipal Party Committee and the Xiada Commune Party Committee have used these two typical examples to educate cadres, improve leadership styles and methods, and take measures to strengthen the leadership work of the Luoyuan Brigade.

    土地在人种  增产在领导
    山后大队自然条件坏，干部深入领导，坚决贯彻政策，生产节节胜利
    罗源大队自然条件好，领导放任自流，工作主次不分，生产步步落后
    本报讯　福建南平夏道公社有两个生产大队，由于队干部领导作风和领导方法不同，生产有显著差别。在山后大队，丘丘稻叶乌黑油绿，分蘖旺盛，田里看不见杂草；在罗源大队，晚稻追肥不足，不少稻苗发黄，杂草蔓生，有的田里的中稻看去还不如山后大队的晚稻高。
    是不是山后大队自然条件比较好？不是。情况恰恰相反：山后大队位于高山顶上，山岭陡峭，交通不便，田地分散，气候寒冷，作物生长季节较迟，罗源大队在山脚下，地势较平坦，土地较集中，自然条件比山后大队好。从劳力上看，山后大队每个劳力平均种十一点八亩；罗源大队每个劳力平均种九亩。
    这两个大队生产上所以如此悬殊，根本原因是在于队干部的领导作风和领导方法。
    山后大队党支部对贯彻党的以农业为基础的方针坚决有力。“双抢”工作一布置下来，党支部就抓紧时机，在党内和群众中开会反复动员，集中全队80％以上劳力，大搞抢收抢种。党支部五个支委，固定分片包干领导五个生产队，他们都住在田头，坚持在生产第一线，参加生产，领导生产。平时，党支部书记和三个大队长以上的干部，每月参加劳动平均都在二十二天以上。生产小队长和社员一样，每月劳动一般都有二十八天。
    在夏收夏种开始时，党支部对集中劳力抓得紧，但是有些生产队贯彻不快。第三生产小队有二十九个劳力，开始只有九个人用在收种方面，其他劳力都分散使用在林业采伐、畜牧场和其他农活上。分配做主要农活的劳力也安排不合理，九个劳力堆在一起共用一个打谷楻，有的收、有的打、有的就闲着没事干。支部书记单连源深入这个小队发现这个问题，就召集小队干部、群众共同商讨解决办法。立即从林业采伐和后勤各部门中抽劳力，夏收夏种的劳力增加到86％以上。同时又调整劳动组织，一个打谷楻由九个人减为五个人，平均每人每天由收谷一百多斤增加到近三百斤。党支部还采取青壮年劳力包远田、老弱劳力包近田，实行就地收、就地打、就地晒、就地送，进一步提高工效。往年要将山下收好的稻子挑到山上村里晒干，然后又挑下山去缴公粮，往返二、三十里，浪费劳力很大。今年由于在田头边收、边晒、边送，就节约了四千零二十个工。
    在抓生活方面，党支部派出财贸书记到食堂里挂帅，加强领导，建立蔬菜基地，使社员吃得饱、吃得好、吃得卫生。社员生产情绪饱满，干劲很足，使生产工作步步主动，样样抢先。
    罗源大队党支部对贯彻党的以农业为基础的方针思想不明确，行动不坚决。支部在布置“双抢”任务的群众大会上，先谈卫生工作和业余教育，然后才简单地布置一下夏收夏种，工作主次不分，轻重倒置。劳力迟迟集中不起来，全队一百三十九个男全劳力，用在农业生产上的只有六十四个，还不到50％。其他都用在采伐场、烧木炭、砍柴火、挖毛竹等。收种进度很慢，一百六十三亩连作早稻，连收带种花了十五天时间；晚稻插秧因劳力少，有很大部分是插7×8寸的，达不到合理密植的规格；肥料数量和质量都差，虽然这个队离南平城关不远，可以到城关挑粪，但因为抽不出劳力，每亩也只施五、六担肥。大队干部不能经常深入第一线，参加生产，领导生产。干部虽然也有分工，但因为没有深入到生产实践中去，不能发现问题、解决问题，工作、生产陷于自流。党支部对社员生活也关心不够。第四生产队食堂八十六人吃饭，只种了一亩菜，而且由于管理不善，收获量很少，蔬菜供应不上，一步被动，步步被动，因为支部领导抓得不紧，目前田间管理又落在各大队的后头。
    两种不同的领导作风领导方法，在工作和生产上必然有两种不同结果。中共南平市委和夏道公社党委已通过这两个典型事例来教育干部，改进领导作风、领导方法，并采取措施加强罗源大队的领导工作。
