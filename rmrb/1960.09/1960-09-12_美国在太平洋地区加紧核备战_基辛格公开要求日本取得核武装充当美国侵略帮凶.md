Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, September 10th: A dispatch from a Kyodo News Agency reporter in Washington today revealed the fact that the United States, disregarding the demands of people around the world for the establishment of a nuclear-weapon-free zone in Asia and the Pacific, is actively deploying nuclear weapons in the region, pursuing a policy of war and aggression.

The Kyodo News Agency reporter stated that the American magazine "Missiles and Rockets," published on September 9th, revealed the full picture of US nuclear equipment in the Pacific region. The magazine said that the US Pacific Fleet currently possesses a total of ten nuclear-equipped submarines and destroyers, which will soon increase to thirteen. The nuclear equipment of these warships includes the "Regulus" I missile with a range of 800 kilometers, the SAS "Talos" missile with a range of 104 kilometers, and the "Astor" nuclear torpedo. The United States also plans to equip its latest nuclear weapon, the "Polaris" missile.

The report also revealed that US ground forces in Okinawa, Taiwan, and South Korea have already been equipped with the "Matador," "Nike," and "Honest John" missiles.

Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, September 10th: According to reports in Tokyo newspapers today, an American advocate of nuclear armaments and "limited war" yesterday openly demanded that Japan possess nuclear armaments in order to play a role in local wars launched by the United States.

This war advocate is Henry Kissinger, Director of the Special Studies Project of the Rockefeller Foundation and a professor at Harvard University. He openly put forward this proposition, which endangers peace and the interests of the Japanese nation, at a press conference held at the Asia Hall in Tokyo. Kissinger, who arrived in Japan on September 4th for a "study trip," is also a policy advisor to the US Joint Chiefs of Staff. He is reportedly influential in US strategic planning.

Kissinger advocated: "Conventional weapons cannot be used effectively without the backing of readily available nuclear weapons."

He also stated without concealment: "If Japan wants to defend itself independently, it should arm itself with nuclear weapons."

Kissinger also said: "Japan, as a member of free Asia, has an important role to play. In this sense, the Japan-US Security Treaty is necessary not only for Japan but also for the defense of other free countries in Asia."

He also threatened that if Japan is unwilling to lend military bases to the United States, "it will be difficult for the United States to defend Japan and other free countries as effectively as it does now."

Since arriving in Japan on September 4th, Kissinger has made a report to approximately fifty officials from the Japanese "Defense Agency."

The news indicates that the United States has recently been constantly urging Japan to accelerate its military expansion.

According to Japan's Jiji Press, when US Pacific Forces Commander Felt met with Japanese "Defense Agency" Director-General Masumi Ezaki on the 7th, he said: If Japan wants to continue to receive US military "aid," "it must first convince the US Congress that Japan is prepared to make the greatest effort to build its national defense." At the same time, a United Press International dispatch from Tokyo on the 8th stated: "American officials here hinted to Japanese Defense Agency officials on Wednesday that the Tokyo government should shoulder a greater part of the burden in its own defense."

    美国在太平洋地区加紧核备战
    基辛格公开要求日本取得核武装充当美国侵略帮凶
    新华社10日讯　东京消息：日本共同社记者今天从华盛顿发出的一则电讯透露，美国不顾各国人民关于在亚洲和太平洋建立无核武器地区的要求，积极在这一地区配备核武器，推行战争和侵略政策的事实。
    共同社记者说，9日出版的美国杂志“导弹和火箭”透露了美国在太平洋地区的核装备的全貌。杂志说，美国太平洋舰队目前拥有核装备的潜水艇和驱逐舰共为十艘，不久将增加为十三艘。这些军舰的核装备包括射程为八百公里的“雷古拉斯”式一号导弹，射程为一百零四公里的SAS“特洛斯”式导弹和“阿斯塔尔”原子鱼雷。美国并且计划配备美国的最新式核武器“北极星”导弹。
    消息还揭露，美国在冲绳岛、台湾和南朝鲜的地面部队已经配备了“马斯”、“奈克”、“诚实的约翰”三种导弹。
    新华社10日讯　东京消息：据今天东京各报报道，一个美国核军备和“有限战争”鼓吹者昨天公开要求日本拥有核军备以便在美国发动的局部战争中发挥作用。
    这个战争鼓吹者是美国洛克菲勒基金会特别研究所所长和哈佛大学教授亨利·基辛格。他在东京的亚洲会馆举行的记者招待会上公然提出了这种危害和平与日本民族利益的主张。9月4日到达日本作“视察旅行”的基辛格，也是美国参谋长联席会议的政策顾问。据报道，他对美国的战略计划是有影响的。
    基辛格鼓吹说：“如果没有随时可以使用的核武器为后盾，常规武器就不可能得到有效地使用。”
    他还毫不隐讳地说：“如果日本想独立地防卫它自己，它应当用核武器武装起来”。
    基辛格还说：“日本作为自由亚洲的成员，有重要的角色可以扮演。在这个意义上说，日美安全条约不仅对日本而且对亚洲其他自由国家的防务来说都是必要的”。
    他并且威胁说，如果日本不愿意把军事基地借给美国，“美国就很难像目前那么有效地保卫日本和其他自由国家的安全。”
    基辛格9月4日到达日本以后，曾向日本“防卫厅”的大约五十名官员作了报告。
    消息表明，美国最近接连不断地催促日本加速扩充军备。
    据日本时事通讯社报道，美国太平洋地区武装部队总司令费耳特在7日同日本“防卫厅”长官江崎真澄会谈时说：日本要继续得到美国的军事“援助”，“必须首先使美国国会确信日本准备以最大的努力来建立国防”。同时，美国合众国际社8日发自东京的电讯说：“这里的美国官员星期三向日本防卫厅官员暗示，东京政府应该在自己的防务中负起更大的一部分担子”。
