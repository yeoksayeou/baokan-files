Xinhua News Agency, Guiyang, 20th: Since the launch of the production increase and economy drive in August, the iron smelting industry in Guizhou Province has seen a substantial increase in pig iron production and a significant improvement in quality.

During the production increase and economy drive, workers in Guizhou's iron smelting plants reviewed and summarized the production situation for the first seven months, and discussed and formulated production increase and economy plans for the next four months. Each blast furnace and team also selected opponents and enthusiastically launched a production increase and economy competition.

Workers in each plant have regarded technical innovation and technical revolution, especially the promotion of key advanced experiences, as an important measure to increase pig iron production. The iron smelting workshop of the Shuicheng Iron and Steel Plant, on the basis of the original parallel operation of blowers, also replaced the large blower, increasing the air volume, so that pig iron production increased by 30% compared with the past. In addition to establishing and improving the regular maintenance and ash removal systems for the air supply system and hot blast stove, the Fuquan and Yangliujie Iron and Steel Plants also adopted the "five no entries into the furnace" measures in terms of charging, that is, ore that is not roasted does not enter the furnace, ore with uneven particle size does not enter the furnace, pulverized coke and pulverized ore do not enter the furnace, ore with low grade does not enter the furnace, and ore that is not tested does not enter the furnace. Due to these measures, the furnace conditions of these two plants are more stable, and production is rising steadily.

The Party committees of each iron plant also mobilized workers to overcome sulfur hazards and improve the quality of pig iron.

Xinhua News Agency, Hohhot, 20th: Coal mine workers in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region warmly responded to the proposal of the Jingxi and other nine mining bureaus to coal mine workers across the country to increase the production of more and better coal. Workers in the four major coal mines of Baotou, Zhalainuoer, Wuda, and Zhuozishan, and many local coal mines such as Laoshiban and Silonggou, recently seriously discussed and summarized their production experience from January to August this year, and launched a production increase and economy competition.

On September 13, the workers of the Baotou Mining Bureau created the highest daily output record since the second half of this year. After overfulfilling the mining and tunneling tasks in early September, the Zhalainuoer Mining Bureau also created a new daily output record on September 13, increasing the average daily output by 27% compared with early September, and the quality of raw coal has been greatly improved. All departments of coal mines in the region have formed a production upsurge of producing more coal and producing good coal.

    比实干　比巧干　增产钢煤
　　贵州省炼铁工人鼓干劲闹革新多炼生铁
　　内蒙古大小煤矿你追我赶多产煤产好煤
    据新华社贵阳20日电　贵州炼铁工业战线从8月份开展增产节约运动以来，生铁产量有了大幅度的增长，质量也有显著提高。
    贵州各炼铁厂的职工，在增产节约运动中，检查和总结了前七个月的生产情况，讨论和制订了今后四个月的增产节约计划。各高炉和班组，还互选对手，热烈地展开了增产节约竞赛。
    各厂职工都把技术革新和技术革命，特别是推广关键性的先进经验，作为增产生铁的重要措施。水城钢铁厂炼铁车间，在原有风机并联的基础上，又更换了大的鼓风机，增大了风量，使生铁产量比过去提高30％。福泉、杨柳街钢铁厂，除了建立健全对送风系统和热风炉的定期维修、清灰等制度外，还在加料方面采取了“五不入炉”的措施，即矿石不焙烧不入炉，粒度不匀不入炉，粉焦、粉矿不入炉，矿石品位低不入炉，矿料不化验不入炉。由于采取了这些措施，这两个厂的高炉炉况更加稳定，产量节节上升。
    各铁厂党委还发动职工攻克硫害，提高了生铁质量。
    据新华社呼和浩特20日电　内蒙古自治区煤矿职工，热烈响应京西等九个矿务局向全国煤矿职工提出的增产更多、更好的煤炭倡议。包头、扎赉诺尔、乌达、卓资山等四大煤矿和老石旦、四龙沟等许多地方煤矿职工，最近认真讨论和总结了今年1至8月份的生产经验，开展了增产节约竞赛。
    包头矿务局职工，在9月13日创造了今年下半年以来日产量最高纪录。扎赉诺尔矿务局在9月上旬超额完成采掘任务以后，也在9月13日创造了日产量的新纪录，比9月上旬平均日产量提高27％，原煤质量有很大提高。全区煤矿的各个部门，都形成一个多产煤、产好煤的生产高潮。
