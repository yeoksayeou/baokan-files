Xinhua News Agency report: Jilin, Liaoning, Inner Mongolia, Shanxi, and other provinces and regions are seizing the season when various wild plants are ripening in large quantities, and launching a concentrated "small autumn harvest" campaign.

In Jilin Province, by September 10th, in less than a month, the five regions of Changchun, Jilin, Siping, Baicheng, and Tonghua alone had collected 1.1 million tons of various wild plants. Currently, the collection army of over 870,000 people active in the high mountains, dense forests, and barren grasslands, and thousands of transport vehicles, are transporting various wild plants and processed products from the mountains and grasslands to railways and highways.

While collecting, Jilin is also carrying out the comprehensive utilization of wild plants. The province has built small and medium-sized processing plants in towns, mountain villages, and collection points, with 938 already in production. The large-scale production of finished products from raw materials reduces material loss and saves transportation capacity.

Thanks to the commercial departments' timely attention to the purchase of wild plants, the total amount of wild plants purchased in the province by September 10th increased by 83% compared with the same period last year.

In Liaoning Province, Xinmin, Faku, and ten other counties mobilized a total of 380,000 commune members, workers, and students, and by September 14th, had collected more than 15 million catties of various grass seeds such as barnyard grass and water grass (feed and sideline raw materials). In Faku County, each commune has dedicated personnel to collect grass seeds, and all commune members also take time to collect. Daqingdui Commune in Tieling County implemented the method of "not walking in the fields in vain, not returning empty-handed," and "taking a bag to the field, everyone carrying a basket," and the amount of grass seeds collected increased sharply.

Rural areas in the eastern and western mountainous areas of Liaoning are busy collecting wild fruits.

During the "small spring plowing," many oil crops were planted along the edges of fields and around houses, and now they are ripening one after another. Lütun Commune in Gaiping County, the most outstanding in the province's "small spring plowing" campaign, put forward the slogan of "reaping one tree when it ripens, reaping one patch when it ripens, not wasting a single grain." In six days, they harvested 2,500 catties of oil seeds. In Chaoyang, Lüda, and other places where the large-scale autumn harvest began earlier, attention was also paid to the work of small autumn harvest, and the large-scale autumn harvest and small autumn harvest were unified, ensuring that the small autumn harvest could also be done well at the same time.

In Inner Mongolia, nearly one million auxiliary and semi-labor forces were mobilized to carry out the "small autumn harvest" campaign to collect wild plants. By early September, Hulunbuir, Ulanqab, Bayannur, and other leagues, and the Greater Khingan Mountains and other key areas, had collected more than 40 million catties of barnyard grass, various medicinal materials, mushrooms, fungus, edible black moss, wild rosemary, red beans, daylilies, roses, and various wild fibers.

In the small autumn harvest campaign, all localities closely combined collection, purchase, transportation, and processing. While helping and guiding the rural and pastoral people's communes to collect, the commercial departments seized the purchase and transportation work and supplied processing equipment, which greatly promoted the progress of the small autumn harvest campaign. From August to early September, the commercial department of Bayannur League helped the communes establish more than 100 processing plants. Now, these processing plants have successfully trial-produced more than 30 kinds of products such as various fibers, aromatic oils, and pulp.

In Wuxiang County, Shanxi, which acted quickly, more than 35,000 commune members were mobilized, and in just five days, they collected more than 2 million catties of various wild plant materials. Heshun County conducted a comprehensive survey of wild plants, classifying them according to different maturity periods, so that one type is harvested when it matures. By the end of August, more than 1.1 million catties of wild plant materials such as pine nuts and filberts had been collected.

Collecting, processing, and utilizing at the same time is a significant feature of Shanxi's "small autumn harvest" this year. Within nearly a month and a half, Xinding County has produced more than 89,000 catties of non-grain wine, sauces, and vinegar, more than 40,000 catties of fruit candies, 28,000 catties of pulp, more than 24,000 meters of wild fiber cloth, and 295 blankets. These products are being supplied to the market.

　　开展小秋收大采野生植物
　　吉林辽宁几十万人四出采集野生工业原料、水果
　　内蒙古山西采集调运加工一条龙工作进展迅速
    综合新华社讯　吉林、辽宁、内蒙古、山西等省区抓紧各种野生植物大批成熟的季节，展开突击采集的“小秋收”运动。
    吉林省到9月10日止，不足一个月的时间，仅长春、吉林、四平、白城、通化等五个地区，已采集各种野生植物一百一十万吨。目前，全省活动在高山密林和荒洼草原上的采集大军已达八十七万多人，数以千计的运输车辆正由山区和草原向铁路、公路沿线运输各种野生植物和加工成品。
    在采集的同时，吉林各地还开展了野生植物的综合利用工作。全省已在城镇、山村和采集点上建起中小型加工厂，并已有九百三十八处投入生产。由于大批原料制成成品，既减少了原料损失，又节约了运输力量。
    由于商业部门及时重视了野生植物收购工作，到9月10日止，全省已收购的野生植物总量，比去年同期增加了83％。
    辽宁省新民、法库等十个县共出动社员、职工、学生三十八万人，到9月14日已采集风稗、水稗等各种草籽（饲料和副业原料）一千五百多万斤。法库县各公社都有专人采草籽，全体社员也抽空采集。铁岭县大青堆公社实行“下地不白走，回来不空手”、“下地带口袋，人人捎一篓”的办法，所采草籽数量猛增。
    辽宁东部山区、西部山区农村正忙着采集野果。
    各地在“小春耕”时利用地边地角、房前屋后种下了许多油料作物，现在都已陆续成熟。全省“小春耕”运动最出色的盖平县芦屯公社，提出“熟一棵收一棵，熟一片收一片，不糟蹋一粒”的口号，六天就收油料籽二千五百斤。朝阳，旅大等地大田秋收开始较早的地方，也都注意了小秋收的工作，把大秋收与小秋收做了统一安排，保证小秋收也能同时做好。
    内蒙古各地出动近一百万个辅助劳力和半劳动力，开展了采集野生植物的“小秋收”运动。到9月上旬止，呼伦贝尔、乌兰察布、巴彦淖尔等盟和大兴安岭等重点地区，已采集水稗子、各种药材、蘑菇、木耳、发菜、杜香、红豆、黄花菜、玫瑰和各种野生纤维共四千多万斤。
    在小秋收运动中，各地都把采集、收购和调运、加工等工作紧密结合起来。商业部门一边帮助指导农村、牧区人民公社采集，一边抓紧收购和调运工作，供应加工设备，大大促进了小秋收运动的进展。巴彦淖尔盟商业部门从8月到9月上旬，就帮助公社建立起一百多座加工厂。现在，这些加工厂已经试制成功各种纤维、芳香油、纸浆等三十多种产品。
    山西行动较快的武乡县，出动了三万五千多社员，仅五天时间，就采集了各种野生植物原料二百多万斤。和顺县对野生植物经过全面勘察，按照不同的成熟期，进行分类排队，做到熟一宗，采一宗，到8月底已采集松籽、毛榛等野生植物原料一百一十余万斤。
    边采集、边加工、边利用是今年山西“小秋收”的一个显著特点。忻定县在近一个半月内，已生产出无粮酒、酱、醋副食品八万九千余斤，水果糖四万余斤，纸浆二万八千斤，野生纤维布二万四千多米、毯子二百九十五块。这些产品正在供应市场。
