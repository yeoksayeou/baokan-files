Cuba, oh Cuba, my suffering brother! For so many years, your sorrowful songs have lingered in my heart. In those songs, I glimpse your figure, I see you toiling tirelessly, in the sugarcane fields, in the mines, your face covered in blood, sweat pouring down! A constant barrage of whips makes you tremble; my heart aches like it's being cut by a knife, anger surges within me. The poisonous serpent of the North, the green devil, greedily drinks your blood, sucks the marrow from your bones! "So close to the United States, so far from God!" You and your Latin American brothers together, weep and lament day and night. But what good is sighing? Even tears can run dry! This unfortunate fate must be changed with your own hands.

Cuba, oh Cuba, my heroic brother! José Martí's fiery verses are once again summoning torrential rains and violent winds. I see in the storm, Caribbean waves thousands of feet high, heroic Cuba stands tall, behind her gleaming with a thousand and one machetes. Cuba, you opened the windows, letting the storm of revolution pour in, across the vast lands of Latin America, banners of freedom ripple like the sea. The Panama Canal, the waves are swift and the sounds are loud; Dominicans pick up guns, Puerto Ricans raise their fists… Palm trees guard the coast, bayonets rise on cacti, sugarcane fields unfurl banners, the six-string guitar sounds the storm… Who is willing to endure another's whip? Who is willing to be another's "backyard"? Listen, listen, roars rise from the ground, millions of chains must be broken together!

Cuba, oh Cuba, my unyielding brother! Today, in my heart, I hear the echo of your battle songs. In those songs, I glimpse your figure, I see your proud head held high, holding the "Declaration of Havana," scowling at the American big stick. This declaration beats the drums of war, calling on the people to fight to defend their homeland; this declaration blows the horn of liberation, and the entire Latin America echoes the call. In the storm of struggle, I see you, Cuban peasant, falling on the newly distributed land, your body covered in blood… American planes scream overhead, sugarcane fields burn all around, but you do not yield, in your hand you still tightly grip that machete! Yes, Cuba has not yielded, a million militiamen are vigilant against the enemy! "Cuba yes, Yankees no!" The battle song soars into the clouds! Cuba, you are not alone, all the people of Latin America are at your side, and there are six hundred million sons and daughters on the banks of the Yangtze River, and the righteous poems of poets around the world! Look, the Asian sun is brilliant, Africa has already dawned, and the dawn of Latin America is coming from all directions!

[Note] * The United States "United Fruit Company," which carries out economic plunder in Latin America, is called the "Green Devil" by the people of Latin America.
     * These two sentences are Latin American proverbs.

    古巴呵，我的弟兄
    程光锐
    一古巴呵古巴，我的苦难的弟兄！多少年了，我的心上，萦绕着你悲伤的歌声。歌声里闪过你的身影，我看见你终日劳动不息，在蔗田里，在矿井下，满脸鲜血，汗流如雨！一阵阵皮鞭，你浑身颤抖；我的心如刀割，愤怒涌上心头。北方的毒蛇，绿色的魔鬼，?喝干你的鲜血，吸尽你的骨髓！“离美国太近，离上帝太远！”?你和拉丁美洲弟兄一起，日日夜夜流着泪悲叹。叹息有什么用？泪水也有时干！这不幸的命运，要用自己的双手改变。
    二古巴呵古巴，我的英勇的弟兄！何塞·马蒂火热的诗句，又在呼唤着暴雨狂风。我看见在暴风雨中，加勒比海波浪千丈高，英雄的古巴站起来，身后闪亮着千万把砍刀。古巴，你打开了窗户，让革命的风暴涌进来，拉丁美洲万里大地，争自由的旗帜如海。巴拿马运河，浪急涛声喧；多米尼加人拿起枪，波多黎各人举起双拳……棕榈树守卫着海岸，仙人掌上起了刺刀，甘蔗林扯起了旗帜，六弦琴响起了大风暴……谁愿挨别人的皮鞭？谁愿作别人的“后院”？听，听，吼声平地起，千万条锁链要一齐打断！
    三古巴呵古巴，我的不屈的弟兄！今天呵，我的心上，回响着你战斗的歌声。歌声里闪过你的身影，我看见你骄傲的头颅高昂，手举着《哈瓦那宣言》，横眉怒对美国的大棒。这宣言擂起战鼓咚咚，号召人民为保卫祖国斗争；这宣言吹响解放的号角，整个拉丁美洲山呼海应。在斗争的暴风雨中，我看见你，古巴农民，倒在刚分到的土地上，浑身鲜血淋淋……美国飞机在头上嘶叫，甘蔗田在身边燃烧，可是，你并未屈服，手中还紧握着那把砍刀！是的，古巴并未屈服，百万民兵正警惕着敌人！“要古巴，不要美国佬！”战斗的歌声高唱入云！古巴，你并不孤单，全拉丁美洲人民在你身边，还有长江岸上的六亿儿女，全世界诗人正义的诗篇！看呵，亚洲朝阳灿烂，非洲已经破晓，拉丁美洲的黎明，正从四面八方来到！〔注〕?向拉丁美洲进行经济掠夺的美国“联合果品公
        司”，被拉丁美洲人民称为“绿色的魔鬼”。
      ?这两句是拉丁美洲的谚语。
