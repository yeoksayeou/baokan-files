    General Ne Win, Chief of Staff of the Burmese Armed Forces, was born on May 24, 1911, in Pyay District, Burma. He received his early education in his hometown and later entered Rangoon University.
    In 1932, while working in the postal and telecommunications sector, he joined the "We Burmese Association" (i.e., the Dobama Asiayone), and began to engage in the struggle for Burmese national independence. In 1942, under the leadership of Aung San, Ne Win organized the Burmese "Independence Army" in Thailand and led an advance unit of a brigade to attack Burma.
    During the Japanese occupation of Burma, Ne Win was appointed Commander-in-Chief of the Army with the rank of Colonel. At that time, the Burmese people's hatred for the Japanese occupiers grew day by day. Ne Win, along with Aung San and others, secretly planned to resist Japan and expand their armed forces. On March 27, 1945, the anti-Japanese war broke out in Burma, and Ne Win was responsible for directing operations against Japan in the Irrawaddy Delta region.
    After the end of the war, Britain re-established its rule over Burma. The original anti-Japanese armed forces were reduced and reorganized into regular troops. Ne Win continued to work in the army, first as a Major Battalion Commander in the 4th Burmese Infantry Battalion, promoted to Lieutenant Colonel in 1945, Colonel in 1947, and Brigadier General in the same year.
    In 1948, the Union of Burma was established, and Ne Win was promoted to Major General. In 1949, he assumed the position of Supreme Commander of all Burmese Armed Forces, and was subsequently promoted to Lieutenant General. In 1949, Ne Win joined the cabinet as Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defense and Interior. In 1950, Ne Win resigned from his government post to serve exclusively as Supreme Commander. After the reorganization of the Burmese Armed Forces, he was appointed Chief of Staff of the Armed Forces. In January 1956, he was promoted to General.
    In October 1958, the U Nu government resigned, and the parliament, based on U Nu's recommendation, authorized Ne Win to form a caretaker cabinet. In February 1959, the Burmese parliament passed a proposal to amend Article 116 of the Constitution, extending Ne Win's term as Prime Minister until the 1960 general election. On April 4th of this year, based on the results of the general election, Ne Win handed over the post of Prime Minister to U Nu and served exclusively as Chief of Staff of the Armed Forces.
    In September 1955, General Ne Win led a Burmese military friendship delegation to visit our country. In January of this year, General Ne Win again visited our country in a friendly capacity as the Prime Minister of the Union of Burma, and on behalf of the Burmese government, signed the "Treaty of Friendship and Non-Aggression between the People's Republic of China and the Union of Burma" and the "Agreement between the Government of the People's Republic of China and the Government of the Union of Burma on the Boundary Question between the Two Countries".

    奈温将军
    缅甸国防军总参谋长奈温将军，1911年5月24日生于缅甸的卑谬县，早年在其家乡受教育，后入仰光大学。
    1932年在邮电部门服务时，参加了“我缅人党”（即德钦党），开始投入争取缅甸民族独立的斗争。1942年，在昂山领导下奈温在泰国组织缅甸“独立军”，并率领一个旅的先头部队攻入缅甸。
    在日本占领缅甸时，奈温被任为上校衔的陆军总司令。当时缅甸人民对日本占领者的仇恨日益增长。奈温和昂山等人一起秘密筹划抗日，扩大武装力量。1945年3月27日缅甸爆发抗日战争，奈温在伊洛瓦底江三角洲地区负责指挥对日作战。
    抗战结束，英国重新统治缅甸，原来的抗日武装被裁减和改编为正规军，奈温继续留在军队中工作，先在缅甸第四步兵营任少校营长，1945年升为中校，1947年升为上校，同年升准将。
    1948年缅甸联邦成立，奈温升少将，1949年担任全缅武装部队最高统帅职务，随即升为中将。1949年奈温入阁任副总理兼国防和内政部长。1950年奈温辞去政府职务，专任最高统帅；缅甸国防军改组后，改任三军总参谋长；1956年1月晋升上将。
    1958年10月吴努政府辞职，国会根据吴努的建议授权奈温出组看守内阁。1959年2月，缅甸国会通过了修改宪法第一百一十六条的提案，延长奈温的总理任期至1960年的大选为止。今年4月4日根据大选结果，奈温将总理职务移交吴努，专任三军总参谋长。
    1955年9月奈温将军曾率领缅甸军事友好代表团来我国访问。今年1月，奈温将军又以缅甸联邦总理的身份来我国进行友好访问，并代表缅甸政府，与我国政府签订了“中华人民共和国和缅甸联邦之间的友好和互不侵犯条约”和“中华人民共和国政府和缅甸联邦政府关于两国边界问题的协定”。　（新华社）（附图片）
