    The Leap Forward of People
　　Lao She

    Whenever Tianqiao is mentioned, old Beijing residents will sigh and say: it was the darkest place before liberation. In the early days of liberation, some people also thought this way: everything else is easy to handle, but transforming Tianqiao is not easy, its old foundation is too bad and too rotten!
    However, under the leadership of the Communist Party, a miracle appeared, Tianqiao changed! And it changed so thoroughly, there is now the Tianqiao People's Commune! Today, the sound of Tianqiao is no longer the shouts and roars of bullies and hooligans, no longer the flamboyant deceptions of selling fake medicines, used clothes, and broken watches, no longer the dying groans and curses of hunger and cold, but the cheers and songs that "the People's Commune is a bridge, and communism is paradise!"
    The changes are too great, no one can use a few words to describe the myriad changes of the five trades and eight industries, and the three religions and nine streams of Tianqiao in the past eleven years! So, let's talk to Aunt Wang Yurong—a municipal people's representative and the head of the Red and Expert Service Station of the Tianqiao People's Commune. She has lived in Tianqiao since she was a child and has drunk the bitter water of life for more than forty years. She is now the head of the service station and knows the content of Tianqiao's transformation well. Yes, talking to her will surely educate us and benefit us a lot!
    I visited Aunt Wang. She is almost fifty years old, not very strong, but in very good spirits. When she is not speaking, she is so steady. Without her saying it, anyone can see that she must have been a housewife who suffered from hunger and cold and was often wronged. But as soon as she opens her mouth, she is so kind, forthright, and confident, it can be seen that she has transformed the suffering she suffered in the past into the power to wholeheartedly serve the people today under the cultivation of the Party. The slight darkness in her silence suddenly disappears from her face, revealing a hearty and kind smile. Her every silence and movement, every darkness and brightness, reflects a history of life from bitterness to happiness. This personal experience is enough to reflect the entire Tianqiao's journey from darkness to light.
    What a lovely aunt she is! Her neat and simple clothes, her earnest language and attitude, seem to indicate that she can stand alone wherever she is placed, and do her job extremely responsibly! How great the Party is, educating this and so many formerly beaten and abused, tearful and silent, illiterate housewives into today's active elements of socialist construction. This is the leap forward of people! With such people, is there still any worry that Tianqiao cannot be transformed well?
    Aunt Wang began by talking about the suffering of the past. Yes, how can we resolutely dedicate all our strength to the Party and repay the Party's life-saving grace if we forget the suffering of the past! Tears welled up in her eyes. She hates, hates the dark old society! She can't forget how her father, who sold boiled tripe for a living, would smile obsequiously and give the bullies the best part of the sheep's tripe, pouring them cup after cup of the best wine, even though he knew that after the bullies finished eating and drinking, they would wipe their mouths and leave without paying a penny. No, sometimes the bullies would do more than just wipe their mouths and leave, they would also order the biggest and thickest tripe to be sent to their homes—of course, without paying! Without another word, he had to smile and promise to send it immediately; if he promised a little late, there was a risk of having his stall kicked over. If the stall was kicked over and the tools were broken, he would not be able to do business again. This was Tianqiao in Aunt Wang's childhood, and it was like this until she was almost forty years old. Whether the Kuomintang came, or the Japanese came, no matter how many people starved to death or froze to death, the bullies were always arrogant and all-powerful. Only when the Communist Party came were the bullies punished as they deserved. Aunt Wang saw how they all knelt before the people to be tried! She breathed a sigh of relief, she loved the Communist Party.
    When thinking of her childhood, how can she not think of her first daughter? The little girl only lived to be six years old, and died of illness and hunger in her mother's arms. She seemed to know that she was going to be separated from her parents forever, touching their faces with her little hands, asking for something to eat, but all she got was a little water. She closed her eyes and never saw the dark Tianqiao again. The parents cried and fainted. Speaking of this, Aunt Wang's tears fell. If the girl could have lived to this day, wouldn't she be like her father, mother, and brothers, becoming a cadre of the country!
    Her son became seriously ill again. The family had no money to hire a doctor, and the mother knelt down to the doctor. The money to get medicine was not enough, and she could not bring the medicine back, so the mother knelt down to the shopkeeper at the pharmacy. Poverty, humiliation, and disease tormented that loving mother's heart every moment!
    Her husband sold newspapers. The police at that time were uniformed robbers: "Give me a newspaper to read!" A slight hesitation would result in a slap in the face. A thousand hands rose up in his heart, wanting to return a thousand slaps to the police who wanted to read the newspaper for free! But who would dare! If he caused trouble, he would be sent to prison, and his whole family would not even have a drop of water to drink! Returning home in anger, who could he vent on? He had to beat and scold his wife. They were originally a loving couple, but after beating her, he would tearfully apologize to his wife, and crying together was their only comfort!
    Her husband's meager income was definitely not enough to support the whole family. Her mother-in-law could not eat enough and cursed her daughter-in-law's bad luck. The children were hungry, and their cries of "Mama" pierced her heart. The mother was not idle, she took in mending and washing, day and night. However, coal, grain, lamp oil, and water were all controlled by the bullies, who raised prices at any time, and there was no way to resist. No matter how hard Aunt Wang worked, her income could not keep up with the rising prices. Suffering all kinds of hardships, wearing her fingertips out, she could not satisfy the needs of her whole family. She had reached a dead end.
    As long as there was a little bit of a way out, Aunt Wang, with her strength and diligence, would surely forge ahead. But there was not a single glimmer of light. She soaked a box of matches, preparing to end everything. Fortunately, her husband discovered it, and they cried together. He begged her to endure, Tianqiao could not be dark forever.
    The sun came out, and Chairman Mao came to Beijing!
    The Wang couple, who could not be poorer, walked towards the sun. They were used to laboring and were not afraid of hardship. They hated the old Tianqiao and wished they could sweep it clean with a broom. However, the power of the bullies and hooligans was strong, and some poor people did not dare to stand up and join the struggle. Large and small capitalists were accustomed to cheating for huge profits, and secretly sabotaged fair trade and marked prices. The residents were also all kinds of people, even more complex than the patterns in a kaleidoscope. At this time, it really took some courage to take the lead in doing street work. The Wang couple came out. What were people who were utterly poor afraid of when they saw the Communist Party?
    Aunt Wang treated the affairs of the street as her own. If anyone was sick, she rushed forward to find medical expenses and send them to the hospital. She could never forget how her daughter died young, and how she kowtowed in public in the pharmacy to beg for medicine. If anyone had difficulties, she would solve them; if there were disputes in any family, she would mediate. She seriously studied the Party's policies and enthusiastically promoted them. She was illiterate and could not remember them. Okay, learn! As long as you are determined to leap forward, there is nothing you cannot do. She became literate. She smiled and told me: "I can already read Chairman Mao's 'On Contradiction'. Whenever there is a difficulty in my work, I open it and read it to solve the problem!"
    She gained the trust of the residents, who elected her as their district representative and city representative. She gloriously joined the Communist Party!
    During the Resist America, Aid Korea movement, she sent her two sons to join the army without hesitation. She loved the new society and the new country, so she let her sons defend it.
    Since the establishment of the Tianqiao People's Commune, she has come to lead the service station. She deeply understands the significance of women's liberation and the liberation of women's labor force. In order to get all the sisters out of their homes and engage in production without any worries, she set a grand ambition to take on all the service items.
    I visited the Red and Expert Service Station (an advanced unit in the city) and the dismantling, washing, and mending workshop, and saw the quality of the work there. Aunt Wang said: "We don't have any other advantages, it's just that the work is solid and meticulous." Yes, I thought in my heart: Aunt Wang knows what the working people's demands are, and the work must be solid and meticulous. I know that she will never do things that are only superficial, she will encourage all the female workers to do a good job with the enthusiasm of service, so that the service station and the commune's production units are united in heart.
    The vast majority of people in the workshop are women, old and young, each with their own corner, working vigorously. Aunt Wang pointed to me: "That young daughter-in-law has always been confined to her home and dared not take a step out of the street alone. When she went out, she did not know north, south, east, or west. She never had a penny in her pocket. Now, she earns her own wages and has savings in the bank." That's right! The commune will make a daughter-in-law who cannot distinguish east, west, north, and south recognize the direction of socialism! The people created the commune, and the commune creates happiness for all the people. With the commune, everyone can leap forward! She pointed out an old woman again:
  "That old woman, her husband died, and she has no children. If it were in the old Tianqiao, she would have no choice but to starve to death! Now, she has food and clothing, and takes twenty-seven yuan a month. So she always says: I have no home, the commune is my home, I don't think about anything except work, if I have to think, I just think that the Party is my life-saving benefactor!"
    Eleven years ago, Tianqiao was a place where people ate people, whoever had the thickest arms, whoever had the worst intentions, whoever got the first share! Today, the commune is a big family, all the members are united as one, the work is different, but the goal is the same—to make production increasingly prosperous, and to make the members' lives increasingly happy. What a big change this is! This is not just a change, but a leap forward, a leap forward of people!
    The Red and Expert Service Station still has difficulties in equipment. Aunt Wang is trying to overcome them in the spirit of starting from scratch. As for saving money, just that large boiler can save eleven tons of coal and four thousand catties of firewood every month; the tea station, the nursery, and some factories all use the boiling water here, and there is no need to start another stove. Business is still developing, and Aunt Wang is planning to add children's lined and cotton shoes, and repair leather and casual shoes. She knows that children wear out shoes the most, and women who have joined the workforce have no time to make shoes for their children themselves. That's right, Aunt Wang in work, just like in being a person, is always down-to-earth and realistic!
    When I thanked her and said goodbye, I asked about her family situation. A joyful light shone in the aunt's eyes: "My husband is the deputy director of a factory, and my eldest and second sons are both veterans, one is a cadre in ethnic affairs, and the other is the director of a workshop in a steel factory, and they are both married and will soon have grandchildren!"
    I congratulated her, and she said: "Thinking about the beginning, looking at the present, I can only thank the Party and Chairman Mao!" (Attached picture)

    人的跃进
　　老舍
    一提起天桥，北京的老住户们一定会叹口气才说：它是解放前的一块最黑暗的地方。解放初期，也还有这么想的：什么地方都好办，改造天桥可不容易，它的老底子太坏太烂啊！
    可是，在共产党的领导下，出现了奇迹，天桥变了！而且变得那么彻底，有了天桥人民公社！今天，天桥的声音已不是当年恶霸、流氓的呼杀喝打，不是卖假药、估衣、破表的天花乱坠的欺哄，不是饥寒交迫的垂死呻吟与诅咒，而是人民公社是桥梁，共产主义是天堂的欢呼与歌唱！
    变化太大了，谁也没法子用三言五语道尽十一年来天桥的五行八作，三教九流的千变万化！那么，让咱们和王玉蓉大娘——市人民代表、天桥人民公社红专服务站站长谈一谈吧。她自幼住在天桥，喝过四十来年的生活苦水。她现任服务站站长，深知天桥改造的内容。对，同她谈谈一定叫我们受到教育，获益不浅！
    我访问了王大娘。她已快五十岁，身体不太壮实，可是精神很好。在她不说话的时候，她是那么稳重，用不着她说，谁都可以看出来她当初必是个忍饥受冻，经常受委屈的家庭妇女。及至她一开口，她又是那么亲切、爽朗、自信，看得出她是在党的培养下，把昔日所受的苦处化为今天全心全意为人民服务的力量。她默坐时的一点晦暗，忽然从脸上消失，露出爽朗亲切的笑容。她的一默一动，一晦一明，反映着一部由酸辛到幸福的生活史。这点个人的经历也足以反映整个天桥的由黑暗到光明。
    她是多么可爱的一位大娘啊！她的整洁朴素的服装，恳恳切切的语言与态度，似乎放在哪里她都可以独当一面，极其负责地把工作作好！党多么伟大，把这个和多少多少个从前挨打受气，忍泪吞声，不识字的家庭妇女教育成为今天的社会主义建设的积极分子。这是人的跃进！有了这样的人，还愁天桥不能改造好吗？
    王大娘一开口就说起往日的痛苦。是呀，忘了昔日的苦痛，怎能坚决地向党献出一切力量，报答党的救命之恩呢！她的泪在眼圈里转。她恨，恨那个暗无天日的旧社会！她没法子忘记她的以卖爆肚为业的父亲，怎样满脸陪笑给恶霸爆羊肚子的最好的部分，一杯又一杯斟上最好的酒，虽然明知道恶霸吃完喝完，抹抹嘴就走，绝对不会给钱。不，恶霸有时候不止抹抹嘴就走，还下令叫把最大最厚的肚子送到家里去——当然也不给钱！没二句话，只好笑着答应马上送去；答应迟了一点，就有踢了摊子的危险。踢了摊子，把家伙打碎，就无法再作生意。这就是王大娘幼年时代的天桥，一直到她将近四十岁还是这样。不管是国民党来了，还是日本人来了，不管人民饿死多少，冻死多少，恶霸始终是气焰万丈，手眼通天。只有共产党来了，恶霸们才受到应得的惩处。王大娘看见了他们怎么一一跪在人民面前受审判！她吐了口气，她热爱了共产党。
    一想起自己的幼年，怎能不想起自己的头生女儿呢。小姑娘只活了六岁，就又病又饿，死在妈妈的怀中。她仿佛晓得将与父母永别，用小手摸着他们的脸，要点东西吃，但得到的只是一点水。她闭上了眼，永不再看黑暗的天桥。父母哭得昏了过去。说到这里，王大娘的泪落了下来。假若姑娘能活到今天啊，岂不也和爸爸、妈妈、弟弟们一样，当上了国家的干部吗！
    儿子又生了重病。家里没钱请大夫，妈妈给大夫下了跪。抓药的钱不够，拿不回药来，妈妈又在药铺给掌柜的跪下。贫困，屈辱，疾病，时时刻刻折磨着那颗慈母的心！
    丈夫是卖报的。那时候的警察是穿着制服的路劫：“来份报看看！”稍一迟顿，就挨上嘴巴。他心里伸出一千只手，想回击白要报看的警察一千个嘴巴！可是，谁敢呢！惹了事，被送入监牢啊，一家大小就连点水也喝不上了！含怒回到家中，拿谁发泄呢？只好打骂老婆。他们本是恩爱夫妻，打完又含泪向妻子道歉，相对流泪是他们唯一的安慰！
    丈夫的微薄收入绝对不够养活一家老小的。婆婆吃不着，咒骂媳妇的命坏。孩子们饿，叫妈妈叫得刺心。妈妈并不闲着，给人家拆洗缝补，日夜不停。可是，煤炭粮食，灯油用水，一切都由恶霸控制着，随时加价，无法抵抗。无论王大娘怎样辛苦，她的收入也追不上物价的上涨。受尽千辛万苦，把手指头磨破，她也无法满足一家老小的口腹要求。她走到了绝路。
    只要有一点点活路，以王大娘的坚强、勤苦，就必定向前闯下去。可是一点点光亮也没有了。她泡了一盒火柴，预备结束一切。幸而被丈夫发现了，他俩抱头大哭。他央求她熬下去，天桥不能永远是乌黑的。
    太阳出来了，毛主席来到了北京！
    穷得不能再穷的王家夫妇朝着太阳走。他们劳动惯了，不怕辛苦。他们恨旧日的天桥，恨不能一扫帚把它扫干净。可是，恶霸流氓们的势力雄厚，有些苦人不敢站出来参加斗争。大小资本家们习惯以欺骗图暴利，对公平交易，明码售货等等，阳奉阴违，暗中破坏。居民呢，什么人也有，比万花筒里的花样还更复杂。在这时候敢带头作街道工作的实在需要些胆识。王家夫妇出来了，穷到底的人，看到了共产党，还怕什么呢？
    王大娘把街道上的事当作自家的事。谁有病，她赶上前去，给设法找医疗费，送到医院去。她永远不能忘记自己的女儿是怎么夭折的，和自己当众在药铺磕头求药。谁有困难，她给解决；谁家有纠纷，她去调解。她认真地学习党的政策，并热心去宣传。她不识字，记不下来。好吧，学！只要下决心跃进，没有作不成的事。她有了文化。她微笑着告诉我：“已经能看毛主席的《矛盾论》了。工作一有困难，便翻开看看，解决问题！”
    她得到了居民们的信任，选举她作他们的区代表、市代表。她光荣地加入了共产党！
    抗美援朝运动中，她毫不犹疑地把两个儿子送去参军。她热爱新社会、新国家，就让自己的儿子去保卫她。
    自从天桥人民公社成立，她就来领导服务站。她深知妇女解放与妇女劳动力解放的意义。为叫姐妹们都从家里出来，从事生产，无后顾之忧，她立下雄心，把服务事项包了下来。
    我参观了红专服务站（全市的先进单位）的拆洗缝补车间，看到那里的工作质量。王大娘说：“我们没有别的好处，就是活儿作的结实、细致。”是的，我心里想：王大娘深知劳动人民的要求是什么，活儿不能不作的结实、细致。我知道她决不会作虚有其表的事儿，她会鼓舞全体女工以服务的热诚作好服务工作，叫服务站跟公社的生产单位心连着心。
    车间里绝大多数是妇女，有老有少，各抱一角儿，精神焕发地作着活儿。王大娘指给我：“那个小媳妇一向被圈在家里，不敢独自迈出街门一步，出了门不认识东西南北。她的腰里从来没有过一分钱。现在呢，自己挣上了工资，在银行里有了储蓄。”对！公社会叫个不辨东西南北的媳妇认识了社会主义的方向！人民创造了公社，公社给全社人民创造幸福。有了公社，人人能够跃进！她又指出一位老太太：
  “那位老人家呀，老伴儿死了，没儿没女。若在旧日的天桥，她除了饿死，没有第二条路！现在，她有吃有穿，每月拿二十七元钱。所以她老说：我没有家，公社就是我的家，除了工作，什么也不想，要想就只想党是救命恩人！”
    十一年前，天桥是人吃人的地方，谁的胳臂粗，谁的心眼坏，谁吃头一份儿！今天，公社是个大家庭，所有的社员都抱成一个团儿，工作不同，而目的则一——叫生产日益昌旺，叫社员生活日益幸福。这是多么大的变化呀！这不只是变化，而是跃进，人的跃进！
    红专服务站在设备上还有困难。王大娘正本着白手起家的精神，设法克服。对于节约，单说那个大锅炉，就每月能省煤十一吨、劈柴四千斤；茶站、托儿所、一部分工厂，都用这里的开水，不必另起炉灶了。业务还在发展，王大娘计划着添作儿童的裌、棉鞋，修理皮、便鞋。她知道儿童最费鞋，而妇女参加了工作以后，无暇自己给孩子们作鞋穿。对了，王大娘在工作上，正像在为人上，总是踏踏实实的，实事求是！
    当我道谢告辞的时候，我问了问她家中的情况。大娘的眼中发出喜悦的光来：“爱人作一个工厂的副厂长，大儿子二儿子都是复员军人，一个作民族事务的干部，一个是钢铁厂的车间主任，都结了婚，快有孙子了！”
    我给她道喜，她说：想想当初，看看现在，只有感谢党和毛主席哩！（附图片）
