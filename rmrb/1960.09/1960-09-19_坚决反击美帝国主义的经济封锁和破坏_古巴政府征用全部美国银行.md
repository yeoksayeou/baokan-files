Xinhua News Agency, Havana, September 17th: In accordance with public needs and interests, the Cuban revolutionary government today, through the means of forced nationalization, took over all branches and offices of American banks located in Cuba. The Cuban government's decision, announced this evening, involves the following American banks: First National City Bank of New York, First National Bank of Boston, and Chase Manhattan Bank.

    Che Guevara, President of the National Bank of Cuba, has been instructed to manage the assets and enterprises of the nationalized American banks.

    The Cuban government's decision points out that after the American government reduced Cuba's sugar import quota, it has continued to carry out open economic aggression against Cuba: restricting trade between the two countries in an attempt to hinder Cuba's economic development; detaining Cuban enterprises' passenger planes under the pretext of demanding repayment of national debt, deliberately reducing Cuba's main international transportation means in order to achieve its increasingly strong attempt to isolate Cuba.

    The decision emphasizes that American banks are one of the effective tools of imperialism in interfering with Cuba, serving American enterprises' monopoly activities in Cuba and the massive influx of imperialist capital into Cuba, which plunders Cuban wealth through usury.

    The decision points out that the aforementioned nationalized American banks have consistently encouraged American enterprises to engage in activities such as acquiring raw materials, developing large plantations, and operating businesses, which helps increase the import of American industrial products, in order to hinder the development of Cuba's national industry. The decision points out that the American banks remaining in Cuba are "a true and typical manifestation of the phenomenon of imperialism, an obstacle to national liberation"; at the same time, it is a "decisive factor in the abnormal development of the Cuban economic system."

    The decision says that not only that, but the American government has also purposefully adopted an attitude of helping and encouraging activities against the Cuban revolution on American territory. The decision points out that, in addition, "international espionage activities have been strengthened on Cuban territory, these activities are carried out according to the American government's blatant disregard for international law instructions and the obvious attempt to strengthen conspiratorial activities in our country." The resolution emphasizes that the purpose of all these activities of the United States is to "undermine the great achievements of the Cuban revolution, and to basely attempt to subject our motherland to imperialist oppression once again."

    According to the Cuban government's decision, the assets of the nationalized American banks will be compensated in accordance with the Cuban government's law on the expropriation of American property promulgated on July 6 this year. The amount of compensation will be based on the valuation of the above-mentioned property made by experts appointed by the American authorities.

    This morning, Cuban bank worker militia occupied all the nationalized American banks and guarded the buildings of these banks.

    In a joint statement issued this evening, the Federation of Cuban Bank Employee Trade Unions and the Havana Provincial Bank Employee Trade Union expressed their full support for the government's action to nationalize these American banks. The statement pointed out that these American banks "openly engage in conspiracy activities, thereby making it difficult for Cuba's economic development, and trying every possible means to undermine Cuba's economic development." The statement finally called on workers to strengthen the militia organization in the nationalized American banks and to raise revolutionary vigilance.

    坚决反击美帝国主义的经济封锁和破坏
    古巴政府征用全部美国银行
    新华社哈瓦那17日电　古巴革命政府根据公众的需要和利益，今天通过强行征用的手段，把美国银行设在古巴的全部分行和办事处收归国有。古巴政府今天晚间公布的这一决定牵涉到下列几家美国银行：纽约第一花旗银行、波士顿第一国民银行和曼哈顿一大通银行。
    古巴国家银行行长格瓦拉已经受命管理被收归国有的美国银行的财产和企业。
    古巴政府公布的决定指出，美国政府在削减古巴的食糖进口份额以后，继续不断地对古巴进行公开的经济侵略活动：限制两国之间的贸易，企图借以阻碍古巴的经济发展；在要求偿还国债的幌子下扣留古巴企业的客机，蓄意减少古巴的主要国际交通工具来达到其日益强烈的使古巴陷于孤立的企图。
    决定强调指出，美国银行是帝国主义干涉古巴的有效工具之一，它为美国企业在古巴进行垄断活动和帝国主义资本大量侵入古巴服务，而帝国主义资本是通过高利贷来掠夺古巴财富的。
    决定指出，上述被收归国有的美国银行一贯鼓励美国企业进行获取原料、开发大庄园和经营商业的活动，这些活动有助于增加美国工业产品的输入，以阻碍古巴民族工业的发展。决定指出，在古巴残存的美国银行，是“帝国主义现象的真正的和典型的表现，它是民族解放的障碍”；同时，它是使古巴“经济制度畸形发展的决定性因素”。
    决定说，不仅如此，美国政府还别有用心地采取了在美国领土上帮助和鼓励反对古巴革命的活动的态度。决定指出，此外，“还在古巴领土上加强了国际间谍活动，这些活动是根据美国政府明目张胆的蔑视国际法的指令以及加强在我国进行阴谋活动的明显企图进行的。”决议强调指出，美国的所有这些活动的目的在于“破坏古巴革命的伟大成就，卑鄙地企图使我们祖国重新遭受帝国主义的压迫。”
    根据古巴政府作出的决定，被收归国有的美国银行的财产将根据古巴政府在今年7月6日颁布的关于征用美国人的财产的法律给予补偿。补偿款项的数额将以美国当局委任的专家对上述财产所作的估价作为依据。
    古巴银行工人民兵今天上午占领了全部被收归国有的美国银行，并且守卫着这些银行的建筑物。
    古巴银行职员工会联合会和哈瓦那省银行职员工会在今天晚间发表的联合声明中，表示完全支持政府采取的把这些美国银行收归国有的行动。声明指出，这些美国银行“公开进行阴谋活动从而给古巴的经济发展带来困难，并且千方百计地破坏古巴的经济发展”。声明最后号召工人们加强被收归国有的美国银行里的民兵组织，并且提高革命警惕性。
