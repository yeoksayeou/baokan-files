Xinhua News Agency, 10th. The envoys of the heroic Guinean people, President Sékou Touré, and the Guinean Republic government delegation he led, arrived in Beijing this afternoon by special plane. The distinguished guests received an extremely warm and grand welcome from more than 500,000 people in Beijing.

Liu Shaoqi, Chairman of the People's Republic of China, went to the airport to welcome the distinguished guests. Also at the airport to welcome them were Vice Chairman Dong Biwu, Chairman Zhu De, Premier Zhou Enlai, and other national leaders.

President Sékou Touré is visiting our country at the invitation of Chairman Liu Shaoqi. He is the first head of state of an African country to visit our country. Beijing today was like a festival, the streets decorated with colorful flags, and thousands upon thousands of people waved flags and flowers, paying tribute with great enthusiasm to the distinguished guests from Africa who had come from afar.

Chairman Liu Shaoqi extended the warmest welcome to the Guinean guests at the airport. He said that the militant friendship between the people of China and Guinea, established in the common struggle against imperialism, binds us together. He warmly praised the heroic and unyielding struggle of the Guinean people against imperialism under the leadership of President Touré. He said, "The Chinese people will always stand firmly on the side of the Guinean people, deeply sympathize with and fully support your just struggle."

Chairman Liu concluded by saying that President Touré's visit to China will make a positive contribution to further consolidating and developing the friendship between the Chinese and Guinean people, to enhancing the unity and cooperation between Asian and African countries, and to safeguarding world peace.

In his speech, President Sékou Touré expressed his deep emotion for the warm welcome extended by the Chinese hosts. President Sékou Touré pointed out that the friendship between the Guinean and Chinese people has a political and historical foundation, and that the two peoples are united by their hatred of imperialism and their will to eliminate it.

President Sékou Touré said that they were visiting China as warriors. He said, "I hope that peace in the world can quickly overcome war." President Touré pointed out that due to the awakening and struggle of the people, imperialism and colonialism will be eliminated from our world.

President Sékou Touré concluded by shouting the slogans: "Down with imperialism!" "Down with colonialism!"

The speeches of Chairman Liu Shaoqi and President Sékou Touré aroused warm applause from the audience.

Today, the national flags of the People's Republic of China and the Republic of Guinea fluttered in the sky above the capital airport. Huge banners were hung on the airport buildings: "Welcome President Sékou Touré of the Republic of Guinea!" "Long live the friendship between the Chinese and Guinean people!" "Long live the great unity of the Asian and African people and the people of the world!" At the airport, people held colorful flags and flowers to welcome the arrival of the distinguished guests.

At 2:15 p.m., when President Sékou Touré's silver special plane landed at the airport, thunderous drums and thunderous applause rang out at the airport. President Sékou Touré stepped out of the cabin with a smile on his face, waving to the welcoming people. At this time, Chairman Liu Shaoqi and other national leaders went to the side of the plane to greet him. Among them were Vice Chairman Dong Biwu, Chairman Zhu De, Premier Zhou Enlai, and Vice Premiers of the State Council He Long, Chen Yi, Bo Yibo, Luo Ruiqing, Vice Chairmen of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress Shen Junru, Guo Moruo, Huang Yanpei, Peng Zhen, Chen Shutong, Saifudin, Cheng Qian, Lin Feng, Vice Chairmen of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference Li Siguang, Bao Erhan, Vice Chairmen of the National Defense Council Zhang Zhizhong, Fu Zuoyi, President of the Supreme People's Court Xie Juezai, Procurator-General of the Supreme People's Procuratorate Zhang Dingcheng, and others. They warmly shook hands with President Sékou Touré and the members of the Guinean Republic government delegation, including Guinean National Assembly Speaker Diallo Saifoulaye and other distinguished guests.

After the military band played the solemn national anthems of the Republic of Guinea and the People's Republic of China, Chairman Liu Shaoqi accompanied President Sékou Touré to review the honor guards of the army, navy, and air force. A group of Young Pioneers ran up and presented flowers to President Sékou Touré and other distinguished guests.

After the speeches of Chairman Liu Shaoqi and President Sékou Touré, President Sékou Touré, Speaker Diallo Saifoulaye, and other distinguished guests, accompanied by national leaders such as Chairman Liu Shaoqi, circled the airport to meet the welcoming masses. The welcoming procession suddenly became joyous, with drums and gongs sounding in unison, and people waving colorful flags, with slogans and applause rising one after another. Pairs of young women continuously ran out of the welcoming line to present flowers to President Sékou Touré and other distinguished guests, expressing the capital's people's warm welcome to the envoys of the Guinean people.

Then, President Sékou Touré, accompanied by Chairman Liu Shaoqi and Premier Zhou Enlai, Speaker Diallo Saifoulaye, accompanied by Chairman Zhu De and Vice Chairman Peng Zhen, and other Guinean distinguished guests, accompanied by Vice Premier Bo Yibo, boarded open cars separately and headed for the guesthouse. Along the way, they received a grand welcome from hundreds of thousands of people amid warm applause, cheers, drums, and firecrackers.

Also at the airport to welcome them today were Vice Ministers of Foreign Affairs Zhang Hanfu and Luo Guibo, China's Ambassador to Guinea Ke Hua, President of the Chinese-African People's Friendship Association Liu Changsheng, heads of other government departments, people's organizations, democratic parties, and Beijing Municipality, generals of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, and people from all walks of life in the capital. Diplomatic envoys and officials of various countries stationed in China, as well as African foreign guests and students in Beijing, also came to the airport to welcome them today.

Xinhua News Agency, 10th. Chairman Liu Shaoqi held a grand state banquet in the banquet hall of the Great Hall of the People tonight, warmly welcoming President Sékou Touré and all the distinguished guests of the Guinean Republic government delegation.

When President Sékou Touré and the Guinean guests, accompanied by Chairman Liu Shaoqi, Vice Chairman Dong Biwu, Chairman Zhu De, and Premier Zhou Enlai, entered the hall, more than a thousand Chinese and foreign guests attending the state banquet expressed their warm welcome with prolonged applause. Guinean National Assembly Speaker Diallo Saifoulaye, Minister of National Economy Louis Lansana Beavogui, Minister of Planning Keita N'Famara, and other distinguished guests attended the banquet.

Chairman Liu Shaoqi gave a speech at the beginning of the state banquet, warmly welcoming His Excellency Sékou Touré, an outstanding African statesman, leader of the Guinean people, and President of the Republic of Guinea, and other distinguished guests of the Guinean government delegation who had come from afar to visit our country. He said that the great victory of the Guinean people has greatly inspired the struggle of the people of African countries against colonialism and for national independence, and accelerated the collapse of the imperialist colonial system in Africa. The Chinese people have always regarded the victory of the Guinean people as their own victory and the achievements of the Guinean people as their own achievements. We express our great admiration for the heroic Guinean people.

Chairman Liu said that today, a heartening and tremendous change is taking place on the African continent, the African people have stood up, and the so-called "Dark Continent" has dawned. The national independence movement in Africa has entered a higher stage. We firmly believe that the future of the great African people is infinitely bright. The struggle of the African people is by no means isolated. The 650 million Chinese people stand firmly on the side of the African people, and the people of all countries in the socialist camp and the people of the world stand firmly on the side of the African people. The African people will surely achieve final victory.

Chairman Liu said that the imperialist countries headed by U.S. imperialism have fallen into a heavy siege by the people of the world, and their lifespan will not be long. However, imperialism is by no means reconciled to its own defeat, and the closer it gets to death, the more it will carry out frantic struggles. U.S. imperialism is currently painstakingly plotting conspiracies of subversion and interference against the people of Cuba and Laos. In Africa, the old-brand imperialists are still using all kinds of conspiracies and tricks in an attempt to maintain or restore their colonial rule; but what is even more noteworthy is that U.S. imperialism is trying its best to replace the position of the old-brand imperialists. U.S. imperialism not only supports French imperialism in carrying out the heinous colonial war in Algeria and supports the colonial authorities of the Union of South Africa in implementing the barbaric policy of racial discrimination, but is also invading the Congo on a large scale under the banner of the United Nations, carrying out interference and creating division in order to realize its conspiracy to swallow the Congo. If U.S. imperialism's conspiracy can succeed in the Congo today, it will deploy its conspiracy to other independent countries in Africa tomorrow. Therefore, the facts clearly show that U.S. imperialism is the most dangerous enemy of the people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America, and the common enemy of all peace-loving countries and people in the world. We firmly believe that as long as the people of Asia, Africa, Latin America, and the world further unite, maintain a high degree of vigilance, and constantly expose all kinds of conspiracies of imperialism, and carry out a resolute struggle against them, the conspiracies of imperialism will surely suffer a complete defeat.

The Chinese people have always spared no effort to strengthen the unity of the countries in the socialist camp, strengthen the unity of all peace-loving countries and people in the world, and carry out an unyielding struggle against U.S. imperialism's aggression and to defend world peace. The People's Republic of China has always pursued a peaceful foreign policy, advocated peaceful coexistence between countries with different social systems, and has made unremitting efforts for this purpose. We advocate the peaceful resolution of international disputes without resorting to force. We have consistently supported the Soviet Union's initiatives and actions on disarmament, the prohibition of nuclear weapons, and other measures aimed at easing international tensions. Our peaceful foreign policy is increasingly gaining the sympathy and support of the people of the world.

Chairman Liu said that the friendship between the Chinese and Guinean people has a deep foundation. Your Excellency President's friendly visit to our country provides us with an opportunity to exchange views on further enhancing the friendly cooperation between China and Guinea, as well as issues of common concern to the two countries. This not only serves the immediate interests of the people of China and Guinea, but will also be conducive to enhancing mutual understanding and friendship between the Chinese people and the people of African countries and to the noble cause of defending world peace.

President Sékou Touré spoke at the state banquet, expressing the deep friendship of the Guinean people and the African people with the Chinese people in unity and friendship. He said that the imperialists slander China in an attempt to politically isolate Africa from your people, but the African people know where the truth lies, because they know that you, like them, have experienced the same colonial disasters, they understand what your great victory over imperialism means for themselves, and they also know that they can draw lessons from your history in order to increasingly effectively arm themselves in the struggle against imperialism. No matter what our common enemies say about your experience, it will only strengthen the existing friendship and solidarity between Africa in general and Asian countries, especially with the country of the great Chinese people.

President Touré said that the African people recognize that, due to the political liberation of the Chinese people and the great achievements your people have made in the economic and cultural fields, it has opened up prospects for them. For them, these are encouraging signs, encouraging them to struggle for political liberation, economic and cultural liberation.

President Touré said, "We are fully confident that the Chinese people have the great determination to do everything in their power to create and consolidate conditions for peace. We say that the great Chinese people can count on the support of the Guinean people. We are proud to be able to be friends of your people."

President Touré said, "We stand in the camp of those who are fighting to achieve justice for the benefit of mankind and all peoples. All peoples are in their hearts opposed to colonialism, fighting for freedom and for the enjoyment of freedom. Colonial rule has come to an end. The end of colonial rule means the free exercise of the functions of sovereignty, making the peoples who have lost their characteristics masters of their own affairs, enabling them to develop normally and to exert all their talents through liberation in the social, economic, and cultural fields." President Touré said that if, in the past, cannons and bombs could intimidate people to force them to accept the shackles of colonialism, then today, cannons and bombs cannot stop people from continuing their struggle, because they are now inspired by factors more powerful than any bomb, that is, they recognize their dignity, the humiliating position they are in, and the will to restore dignity in freedom. All the people, as long as they are determined to strive for freedom, must find the path of solidarity, the path of cooperation, in other words, the path to finally achieve peace, in order to find mankind's escape from poverty and anxiety.

President Touré said that the Guinean people are defending their goals. The Guinean people believe that in order to achieve peace, true peace—not the peace of a few politicians, but the peace of all peoples in love and solidarity—justice must triumph. That is to say: colonialism must end, imperialism must end in the ideological, economic, and cultural fields.

After talking about the bright prospects for Africa, President Touré said, "Africa clearly recognizes what imperialist rule means to it. Africa harbors no hatred towards any nation or any people; however, allow me to say unequivocally and categorically: Africa harbors a deep hatred for imperialism and colonialism, and it will do everything in its power to strive for genuine freedom, so that all Africans can exercise all the functions of their soon-to-be-gained sovereignty in dignity."

The speeches of Chairman Liu Shaoqi and President Sékou Touré were received with extreme warmth. After their speeches, the bands played the national anthems of Guinea and China respectively.

Chairman Zhu De proposed a toast at the state banquet. He said: "I propose, for Mr. Diallo Saifoulaye, Speaker of the National Assembly of the Republic of Guinea, to make greater contributions to the glorious cause of opposing imperialism and safeguarding Guinean national independence; to achieve greater success in the efforts to consolidate and further develop the friendly cooperative relations between China and Guinea, and for the health of Speaker, cheers!"

Vice Premier and Minister of Foreign Affairs Chen Yi also toasted at the state banquet, thanking the ambassadors, chargés d'affaires, and their wives of various countries stationed in Beijing, as well as African friends in Beijing, for attending tonight's banquet. He proposed a toast to the friendship of the people of all countries in the world, to world peace, and to the friendship between the Chinese and African people.

Also attending the state banquet were Vice Chairmen of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress Shen Junru, Guo Moruo, Huang Yanpei, Peng Zhen, Chen Shutong, Cheng Qian, Lin Feng, Vice Premiers of the State Council He Long, Bo Yibo, Luo Ruiqing, Vice Chairmen of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference Li Siguang, Bao Erhan, Vice Chairmen of the National Defense Council Zhang Zhizhong, Fu Zuoyi, President of the Supreme People's Court Xie Juezai, Procurator-General of the Supreme People's Procuratorate Zhang Dingcheng, Vice Ministers of Foreign Affairs Zhang Hanfu, Geng Biao, President of the Chinese-African People's Friendship Association Liu Changsheng, China's Ambassador to Guinea Ke Hua, and others.

Also attending the state banquet were heads of various departments of state organs, people's organizations, democratic parties, and Beijing Municipality, generals of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, and people from all walks of life in the capital.

Diplomatic envoys and officials of various countries stationed in China, foreign guests from Africa and other countries in Beijing, and African students were invited to attend the state banquet.

Before the state banquet, a cocktail party was held. At the cocktail party, President Touré and the Guinean guests met and talked cordially with Chinese and foreign guests. (Attached pictures)

    向坚决反对帝国主义的英雄的几内亚人民致敬
    首都五十万人夹道欢迎塞古·杜尔总统
    刘主席设国宴欢迎几内亚政府代表团
    新华社10日讯　英雄的几内亚人民的使者塞古·杜尔总统和他率领的几内亚共和国政府代表团，今天下午乘专机抵达北京。贵宾们受到了北京五十多万人的极其热烈的盛大的欢迎。
    中华人民共和国主席刘少奇到机场欢迎贵宾。到机场欢迎的还有董必武副主席，朱德委员长，周恩来总理及国家的其他领导人。
    塞古·杜尔总统是应刘少奇主席的邀请到我国作正式访问的。他是来我国访问的第一个非洲国家的元首。北京今天如临佳节，街道上装饰得五彩缤纷，成千成万的人挥舞着旗帜和鲜花，怀着巨大的热情向万里迢迢而来的非洲的贵宾们致敬。
    刘少奇主席在机场上向几内亚的贵宾们表示最热烈的欢迎。他说，中国和几内亚两国人民在反对帝国主义的共同斗争中建立起来的战斗友谊，使我们连接在一起。他热情地赞扬了几内亚人民在杜尔总统领导下对帝国主义进行的英勇不屈的斗争。他说，“中国人民永远坚定不移地站在几内亚人民一边，深切同情和完全支持你们的正义斗争”。
    刘主席最后说，杜尔总统这次访问中国对进一步巩固和发展中几两国人民的友谊、对增进亚非各国的团结和合作、对维护世界的和平，定将作出积极的贡献。
    塞古·杜尔总统在讲话中对中国主人对他们的热烈欢迎表示深为感动。塞古·杜尔总统指出，几内亚人民和中国人民的友谊有着政治的历史的基础，两国人民对帝国主义的仇恨和消灭帝国主义的意志，把我们团结在一起。
    塞古·杜尔总统说，他们是作为战士来中国访问的。他说，我希望世界上和平能够很快战胜战争。杜尔总统指出，由于人民的觉悟和斗争，帝国主义和殖民主义将要从我们的世界上被消灭。
    塞古·杜尔总统最后高呼口号：打倒帝国主义！打倒殖民主义！
    刘少奇主席和塞古·杜尔总统的讲话，激起了全场热烈的掌声。
    今天，中华人民共和国的国旗和几内亚共和国的国旗，在首都机场上空迎风飘扬。机场建筑物上高悬巨幅标语：“欢迎几内亚共和国总统塞古·杜尔！”“中国和几内亚人民的友谊万岁！”“亚非人民和全世界人民大团结万岁！”机场上，人们手持彩旗和鲜花，迎候贵宾们光临。
    二时十五分，塞古·杜尔总统乘坐的银色专机降落在机场上时，机场上响起了喧天的锣鼓声和雷鸣般的掌声。塞古·杜尔总统满面笑容地走出机舱，招着手向欢迎的人们致意。这时，刘少奇主席和国家的其他领导人都走到机旁迎接。他们中间有董必武副主席，朱德委员长，周恩来总理，还有国务院副总理贺龙、陈毅、薄一波、罗瑞卿，全国人民代表大会常务委员会副委员长沈钧儒、郭沫若、黄炎培、彭真、陈叔通、赛福鼎、程潜、林枫，政协全国委员会副主席李四光、包尔汉，国防委员会副主席张治中、傅作义，最高人民法院院长谢觉哉，最高人民检察院检察长张鼎丞等人。他们和塞古·杜尔总统以及几内亚共和国政府代表团团员、几内亚国民议会议长迪阿洛·塞福拉耶等贵宾，一一亲切握手。
    军乐队奏庄严的几内亚共和国和中华人民共和国两国国歌后，刘少奇主席陪同塞古·杜尔总统检阅陆、海、空三军仪仗队。一群少年先锋队员跑上前去，向塞古·杜尔总统以及其他贵宾献花。
    刘少奇主席和塞古·杜尔总统讲话以后，塞古·杜尔总统、迪阿洛·塞福拉耶议长和其他贵宾们，由刘少奇主席等国家领导人陪同，绕机场一周和欢迎群众见面。欢迎行列中顿时欢腾起来，全场锣鼓齐鸣，人们挥动着彩旗，口号声和掌声此起彼伏。人群中一对对女青年不断地从欢迎行列中跑出来，向塞古·杜尔总统等贵宾献花，表示首都人民对几内亚人民的使者的热烈欢迎。

    新华社10日讯　刘少奇主席今晚在人民大会堂宴会厅举行盛大国宴，隆重热烈地欢迎塞古·杜尔总统和几内亚共和国政府代表团全体贵宾。
    当塞古·杜尔总统和几内亚贵宾们由刘少奇主席、董必武副主席、朱德委员长和周恩来总理等陪同步入大厅的时候，出席国宴的一千多位中外人士以长时间的掌声表示热烈欢迎。几内亚国民议会议长迪阿洛·塞福拉耶，国民经济部长路易·兰萨纳·贝阿沃吉，计划部长凯塔·恩法马拉等贵宾都出席宴会。
    刘少奇主席在国宴开始的时候讲话，热烈欢迎非洲杰出的政治家、几内亚人民的领袖、几内亚共和国总统塞古·杜尔阁下和几内亚政府代表团的其他贵宾们远道前来我国访问。他说，几内亚人民的伟大胜利，大大鼓舞了非洲各国人民反对殖民主义、争取民族独立的斗争，加速了帝国主义殖民体系在非洲的崩溃。中国人民一向把几内亚人民的胜利，看做是自己的胜利，把几内亚人民的成就，看做是自己的成就。我们对英勇的几内亚人民表示极大的钦佩。
    刘主席说，今天，非洲大陆正在发生着振奋人心的巨大变化，非洲人民已经站起来了，所谓“黑暗大陆”已经破晓了。非洲的民族独立运动已经进入一个更高的阶段。我们坚信，伟大的非洲人民的前途是无限光明的。非洲人民的斗争决不是孤立的。六亿五千万中国人民是坚决站在非洲人民的一边的，社会主义阵营各国人民和全世界人民是坚决站在非洲人民的一边的。非洲人民一定能够取得最后胜利。
    刘主席说，以美帝国主义为首的帝国主义国家已经陷入全世界人民的重重包围之中，它们的寿命不会很长了。但是，帝国主义决不甘心于它们自己的失败，它们越是接近死亡，就越要进行疯狂的挣扎。美帝国主义目前正在处心积虑地对古巴和老挝人民策划颠覆和干涉的阴谋。在非洲，老牌帝国主义仍在用尽一切阴谋诡计，企图维持或者恢复它们的殖民统治；但更加值得注意的是，美帝国主义正在千方百计地取代老牌帝国主义的地位。美帝国主义不但支持法帝国主义在阿尔及利亚进行罪恶的殖民战争，支持南非联邦殖民当局推行野蛮的种族歧视政策，而且正打着联合国的旗号，大举侵入刚果，进行干涉，制造分裂，以实现其鲸吞刚果的阴谋。如果美帝国主义的阴谋今天能够在刚果得逞，它明天就会向非洲其他独立国家施展其阴谋。因此，事实清楚地说明美帝国主义是亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲人民最危险的敌人，是世界一切爱好和平的国家和人民的共同敌人。我们深信，只要亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲和世界各国人民进一步团结起来，高度地警惕并且不断地揭露帝国主义的各种阴谋，并同它们进行坚决的斗争，帝国主义的阴谋一定要遭受到彻底的失败。
    中国人民始终不遗余力地加强社会主义阵营各国的团结，加强世界一切爱好和平的国家和人民的团结，为反对美帝国主义的侵略、保卫世界和平进行不屈不挠的斗争。中华人民共和国一贯奉行和平的外交政策，主张不同社会制度的国家和平共处，并且坚持不懈地为此进行努力。我们主张和平解决国际争端，而不诉诸武力。我们一贯支持苏联关于裁军、禁止核武器以及其它旨在缓和国际紧张局势的倡议和行动。我们的和平外交政策正日益得到世界各国人民的同情和支持。
    刘主席说，中国人民和几内亚人民的友谊是有着深厚的基础的。总统阁下这次来到我国作友好访问，使我们有机会就进一步增强中几两国的友好合作，以及两国共同关心的问题交换意见。这不仅符合中几两国人民的切身利益，而且将有利于增进中国人民和非洲各国人民的相互了解和友谊、有利于保卫世界和平的崇高事业。
    塞古·杜尔总统在国宴上讲话，他表达了几内亚人民和非洲人民同中国人民团结和友好的深厚友情。他说，帝国主义者诽谤中国，企图使非洲同贵国人民在政治认识上隔绝开来，但是，非洲人民是知道真理所在的，因为他们知道你们像他们一样经历过同样的殖民主义灾祸，他们懂得你们对帝国主义所取得的巨大胜利对于他们自己意味着什么，他们还知道他们能从你们的历史中吸取那些教训，以便在反对帝国主义的斗争中日益有效地把自己武装起来。不管我们的共同敌人对你们的经验说什么，只会加强非洲总的说来同亚洲国家，特别是同伟大的中国人民的国家之间既存的友谊和团结。
    杜尔总统说，非洲人民认识到，由于中国人民政治上的解放、由于贵国人民在经济和文化方面取得了巨大的成就，它就为他们开辟了前景。对他们来说，这些都是鼓舞的标志，鼓舞他们为争取政治上的解放、经济与文化上的解放而斗争。
    杜尔总统说，我们完全相信中国人民有巨大决心要竭尽全力创造和巩固和平条件。我们说，伟大的中国人民可以指望几内亚人民的支持。我们以能作为贵国人民的朋友而感到骄傲。
    杜尔总统说，我们站在争取实现正义以利于人类和各国人民的人们的阵营中。各国人民都是从心底里反对殖民主义，争取自由和争取享有自由。殖民统治已走上穷途末路。殖民统治结束意味着自由行使主权的职能，使曾经丧失了自己的特性的各国人民当家作主，使他们能通过社会、经济和文化各方面的解放得到正常的发展并发挥他们的一切才能。杜尔总统说，如果说，在过去，大炮和炸弹还能威吓人民来迫使他们接受殖民主义的枷锁，那么，在今天，大炮和炸弹都不能阻止人民继续进行斗争，因为他们现在受到比任何炸弹都强有力的因素的鼓舞，那就是他们认识到自己的尊严，所处的屈辱地位和在自由中恢复尊严的意志。所有的人民，只要他们决心争取自由，今后必定要找到团结的道路，合作的道路，换句话说最后实现和平的道路，以便找到人类摆脱贫困和不安。
    杜尔总统说，几内亚人民保卫着自己的目标。几内亚人民认为：要实现和平，真正的和平——不是几个政治家的和平，而将是各国人民在友爱、团结中的和平——必须使正义获得胜利。就是说：必须结束殖民主义，必须结束在意识形态、经济和文化方面的帝国主义。
    杜尔总统在谈到了非洲的光明前景以后说，非洲明确地认识到帝国主义统治对它意味着什么。非洲对任何民族、任何人民不怀仇恨；但是，请允许我毫不含糊地断然说：非洲对帝国主义和殖民主义怀有深刻的仇恨，它将竭尽所能争取名副其实的自由，使非洲各国人能在尊严中行使自己即将争取到的主权的一切职能。”
    刘少奇主席和塞古·杜尔总统的讲话受到了极其热烈的欢迎。在他们讲话以后，乐队分别奏几内亚和中国两国的国歌。
    朱德委员长在国宴上祝酒。他说：“我提议，为几内亚共和国国民议会议长迪阿洛·塞福拉耶先生阁下在反对帝国主义、维护几内亚民族独立的光荣事业中做出更大的贡献；在巩固和进一步发展中几两国友好合作关系的努力中取得更大的成就，为议长阁下的健康，干杯。”
    陈毅副总理兼外交部长也在国宴上祝酒，感谢各国驻北京的大使、代办和他们的夫人，以及在北京的非洲朋友，光临今晚的宴会。他提议为世界各国人民的友好，为世界和平，为中国人民和非洲人民的友谊干杯。
    出席国宴的，还有全国人民代表大会常务委员会副委员长沈钧儒、郭沫若、黄炎培、彭真、陈叔通、程潜、林枫，国务院副总理贺龙、薄一波、罗瑞卿，政协全国委员会副主席李四光、包尔汉，国防委员会副主席张治中、傅作义，最高人民法院院长谢觉哉，最高人民检察院检察长张鼎丞，外交部副部长章汉夫、耿飚，中国非洲人民友好协会会长刘长胜，中国驻几内亚大使柯华等。
    出席国宴的，还有国家机关各部门、各人民团体、各民主党派和北京市的负责人，中国人民解放军的将军们，以及首都各方面的人士。
    各国驻中国的使节和外交官员，在北京的非洲和其他国家的外宾以及非洲留学生，都应邀出席了国宴。
