    "Worker-Peasant Pumping Station"
    Huang Chaorong, a worker and Youth League branch secretary in the Inspection Section of the Yunnan Internal Combustion Engine Factory, was deeply moved after listening to the report on the "Investigation and Visit to Tonghai County" made by the Party Committee Secretary. He thought: At present, the vast number of farmers are engaged in an intense struggle against drought to protect seedlings, and urgently need gas engines and water pumps. What can be done to support the countryside? After thinking it over, he finally realized that each workshop had a batch of scrapped parts piled up, which should be utilized quickly. So he immediately convened a meeting of all the Youth League members and young workers in the section, suggesting that everyone use their spare time to clean up these parts, select them, and, after processing and改造, install a "Youth Model" gas engine to send to the countryside to support agricultural technical transformation. Huang Chaorong's suggestion was supported by all the inspection personnel.
    The news of installing and manufacturing the "Youth Model" gas engine spread quickly, and the Youth League members and young workers in other workshops ran over to question the inspection personnel one after another: "Supporting agriculture is everyone's responsibility. Why didn't you call us to participate in building the 'Youth Model' gas engine?" Finally, the factory's Youth League Committee made a resolution: "Everyone should collect waste materials and take action to support agriculture." This "storm" was finally calmed down. Thereupon, the Youth League members and young workers in all workshops and sections of the factory quickly took action, using their spare time to collect the scrapped parts that had been accumulated in the past and the scrap steel and iron scattered in every corner. Everyone worked together, some casting the engine body, some forging axles, some machining gears, it was a lively scene. After more than a month of efforts by the factory's employees, three 35-horsepower gas engines were manufactured. The factory Party Committee officially named them "Youth Model" and immediately sent them to the Sijie People's Commune by ?Luhu Lake in Tonghai County to participate in the anti-drought and seedling protection struggle. The area irrigated by these three gas engines every day was equivalent to the workload of 1,500 people using waterwheels.
    In order to respond to the enthusiastic support of the vast number of employees of the Yunnan Internal Combustion Engine Factory, the Tonghai County Party Committee of the Chinese Communist Party named this pumping station "Worker-Peasant Pumping Station." (Attached picture)

    “工农抽水机站”
    云南内燃机厂检验科工人、团支部书记黄朝荣，听了党委书记作的“通海县调查访问”的报告后，思想上一直不能平静。他想：目前广大农民正在紧张地进行抗旱保苗斗争，迫切需要煤气机和抽水机，用什么办法来支援农村呢？想来想去，终于想到各车间都堆着一批报废的零件，应当赶快把它利用起来。于是立即召集全科的共青团员、青年职工开会，建议大家利用工余时间把这些零件清理出来，选择一下，经过加工改造，安装一台“青年号”煤气机送到农村，支援农业技术改造。黄朝荣的建议得到了全体检验人员的赞成。
    安装制造“青年号”煤气机的消息，很快地传开了，其他车间的共青团员和青年工人，一个个都跑去质问检验人员：“支援农业，人人有责，为什么搞‘青年号’煤气机不叫我们参加？”最后工厂团委会作了“人人都来收集废料，个个动手支援农业”的决议，这场“风波”才告平息。于是，全厂各车间、科室的共青团员和青年职工，都很快行动起来，利用工余时间，把过去积压下来的报废零件和分布在各个角落的废钢废铁收集起来，大家一齐动手，有的浇铸机身，有的锻压轮轴，有的加工齿轮，真是热火朝天。经过全厂职工一个多月的努力，制出了三台三十五马力的煤气机，厂党委正式命名为“青年号”，立即送到通海县?麓湖旁四街公社，参加了抗旱保苗斗争。这三台煤气机每天抽水灌溉的面积，等于一千五百个人工车水的工作量。
    为了回答云南内燃机厂广大职工的热情支援，中共通海县委把这个抽水机站，命名为“工农抽水机站”。（附图片）
