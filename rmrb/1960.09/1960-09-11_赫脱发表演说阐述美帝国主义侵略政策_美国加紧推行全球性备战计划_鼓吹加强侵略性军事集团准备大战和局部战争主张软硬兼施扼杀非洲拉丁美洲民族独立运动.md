Xinhua News Agency, Washington, September 9th: U.S. Secretary of State Herter on the 8th, at the Associated Press Managing Editors and Publishers Convention, expounded on the U.S.'s global war preparation plan and its aggressive policies toward Africa and Latin America.

In a speech delivered at the conference, Herter said that the U.S. had now established military alliances with forty-two countries. He said, "We are now members of four regional defense agreements (NATO, SEATO, the Organization of American States, and the ANZUS Council) and are active participants in a fifth regional defense agreement (CENTO)." He said that there is now a "broad common security program" (i.e., a plan for military expansion and economic aggression) in the U.S. State Department, and that this program is "functioning" in seventy-four countries and territories, and that the U.S. has "allocated nearly four billion dollars" this year for this purpose.

Herter then said that in order to maintain "peace and confidence," the U.S. must continue to strengthen these aggressive military blocs, "making the defense apparatus, both in terms of weapons and organization, sufficient to deal with the dangers we have been facing," and must make the North Atlantic aggressive bloc "maintain a formidable defense force." He emphasized that, in order to adapt to the aggressive purposes of the North Atlantic bloc, in addition to "modern weapons, there is also a need for a balanced and flexible force capable of dealing with challenges of any location or scale, and a command organization adapted to modern weapons technology." Herter also touted that, in addition to dealing with major wars, the U.S. must "maintain the rapid and adequate" ability to respond to "threats" "other than major wars."

Herter made it clear that the U.S. is striving to strangle the national independence movements in Africa and Latin America. He said that the U.S. intends to make these regions "continue to make progress in freedom and peace."

Herter pointed out that the U.S. is sending its "diplomatic, consular, and other representatives to understand the African continent," and is asking U.S. news agencies to send a large number of reporters to cover the continent from the so-called "news perspective." He also said that the U.S. "has a special program for tropical Africa," and he hopes that next year, regardless of which party is in power in the U.S., this program will be greatly expanded. However, Herter immediately made it clear that the U.S.'s "interest is not in the drink itself." He said that the U.S., in providing assistance to African countries, should "prioritize the development" of what the U.S. considers "necessary systems," and that the U.S. "hopes to encourage regional cooperation," that is, to piece together various blocs controlled by the U.S.

Herter expressed his satisfaction with the U.S.'s infiltration into the Congo. He said that the U.S. government had explored the Congo's "needs" before the Congo's independence and had prepared a huge "aid program." Later, when the so-called Congo "crisis" occurred, the U.S. "immediately and unequivocally" provided "assistance" to the Congo through the United Nations. However, he had to admit that the U.S. had encountered difficulties there.

Herter admitted that, like Africa, the developments in Latin America, the U.S.'s backyard, also made the U.S. "uneasy." He viciously reviled Cuban Prime Minister Castro as a "dictator" and "tyrant." He said that the special committee of the Organization of American States, which is currently being held under U.S. manipulation, is formulating a so-called "social development plan" for the U.S. to further control Latin American countries.

    赫脱发表演说阐述美帝国主义侵略政策
    美国加紧推行全球性备战计划
    鼓吹加强侵略性军事集团准备大战和局部战争主张软硬兼施扼杀非洲拉丁美洲民族独立运动
    据新华社9日讯　华盛顿消息：美国国务卿赫脱8日在合众国际社编辑和发行人会议上阐述了美国全球性的备战计划和对非洲与拉丁美洲的侵略政策。
    赫脱在会议上发表的一篇演说中说，现在美国已经同四十二个国家建立了军事联盟。他说，“现在我们是四个地区性防务协定（北大西洋公约组织、东南亚条约组织、美洲国家组织和美澳新理事会）的成员，并且还是第五个地区防务协定（中央条约组织）的积极参加者。”他说，现在美国国务院里有一个“广泛的共同安全计划”（即进行扩军备战和经济侵略的计划），这项计划在七十四个国家和领地“发挥作用”，美国今年为了这个目的“拨出了将近四十亿美元”。
    赫脱接着说，为了保持“和平与信心”，美国必须继续加强这些侵略性军事集团，“使武器和组织这两方面的防务机构足以对付我们一直面临的危险”，必须使北大西洋侵略集团“保持使人敬畏的防务力量”。他强调，为了适应北大西洋集团的侵略目的，除了“现代化武器以外，还需要一支能够对付任何地点或任何规模挑战的平衡而灵活的部队，以及一个适应现代武器技术的指挥机构”。赫脱还鼓吹说，除了应付大战外，美国必须“保持迅速和充分”的能力来应付“大战以外”的“威胁”。
    赫脱表明美国竭力要扼杀非洲和拉丁美洲的民族独立运动。他说美国打算使这些地区“继续在自由和和平中取得进展”。
    赫脱指出，美国正在派遣它的“外交、领事和其他代表前往了解非洲大陆”，并且要求美国通讯社派遣大批记者从所谓“新闻观点去采访这一大陆”。他还说，美国“有一个关于热带非洲的专门计划”，他希望明年不管美国哪一党当政，都大大扩大这个计划。但是，赫脱马上表明美国“醉翁之意不在酒”。他说，美国在向非洲国家提供援助时要“优先发展”美国认为“所必需的制度”，美国“希望鼓励进行地区性的合作”，也就是拼凑美国控制的各种集团。
    赫脱对美国对刚果的渗入表示得意。他说，美国政府在刚果独立之前就探讨了刚果的“需要”，并且为一项巨大的“援助计划作了准备”。后来，当所谓刚果“危机”出现后，美国又“立即地、毫不含糊地”通过联合国对刚果进行了“援助”。但是，他不得不承认，美国在那里遇到了困难。
    赫脱承认，像非洲一样，美国的后院拉丁美洲的事态发展也使美国“感到不安”。他恶毒地谩骂古巴总理卡斯特罗是“独裁者”、“暴君”。他表示，在美国操纵下现在正在举行的美洲国家组织理事会特别委员会，正在制订一项美国进一步控制拉丁美洲国家的所谓“社会发展计划”。
