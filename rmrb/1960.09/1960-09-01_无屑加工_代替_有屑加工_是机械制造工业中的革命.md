“Chipless Processing” Replacing “Chip-Forming Processing” is a Revolution in the Mechanical Manufacturing Industry
·Haerbin Institute of Technology, Department of Mechanical Engineering, Foundry Teaching and Research Section·
“Chipless processing” is a revolution in the mechanical manufacturing process.
For many years, machine manufacturing has followed a "traditional" process: first, using hot processing methods such as casting, forging, and welding to manufacture the blank of the part, and then using cold processing methods such as turning, milling, planing, and drilling to process the blank into a part, and finally assembling the parts into a machine. In this way, during cold processing (i.e., "chip-forming processing"), 20% to 40% of the metal in the blank is wasted as chips, and a large number of metal cutting machine tools and a large amount of labor are used in the processing of these blanks. In order to operate these machines, a huge amount of electricity is consumed every year.

“Chipless processing” is to adopt various advanced casting, forging, stamping, powder metallurgy, precision drawing, precision rolling, and other processes to greatly improve the accuracy of the blank, saving a lot of machining (i.e., cold processing, "chip-forming processing") time, power, equipment, metal raw materials, and manpower, and directly assembling machines from forged and cast parts. This greatly simplifies the machine manufacturing process, thereby greatly improving labor productivity.

Taking Harbin Jiancheng Machinery Factory as an example, since this factory started producing 201-type battery cars in 1958, its production tasks have continued to grow, and the contradiction between insufficient machining equipment and labor has become increasingly prominent. In order to solve this problem, they have sought many ways to improve machining productivity, promoted many advanced experiences, and increased production by twelve times, but still could not meet the needs of the car using departments. This spring, after they adopted "chipless processing" for more than 90% of the battery car's components, they saved forty-two cutting machine tools, more than one hundred and sixty technicians, and eight hundred and ninety square meters of production space; within this year, they can also save four hundred and sixty tons of metal materials. Therefore, as soon as "chipless processing" appeared, it had a strong vitality and was highly valued by the superior Party committee and warmly welcomed by the majority of employees. Soon after, many factories in Harbin began to use "chipless processing" to make mechanical parts such as 50-horsepower winches, water turbines, and air compressors. The gears cast by Harbin No. 1 Machinery Factory using "chipless processing" achieved the precision and finish of precision turning. People's minds are becoming more and more liberated, and they dare to do more and more. Many factories started with redesigning and cutting "appendices," improved tooling according to different production characteristics, applied new processes, and widely used new materials, replacing steel with iron, metal with plastic, and high-melting-point materials with low-melting-point materials. By the end of May, the production of nine thousand eight hundred parts in two hundred and seventy-nine types of machinery throughout the city had realized "chipless processing."

The "Chipless—Chip-Forming—Chipless" Processing Embodies the Law of Negation of the Negation in the Development of Things

Since "chip-forming processing" is troublesome, why did this processing method emerge in the first place? Why do we have to move towards "chipless processing" today? This is a question that must be answered in promoting "chipless processing."

Chairman Mao once told us that we should study the development of things from the inside of things, from the relationship between one thing and other things, and from the internal contradictions of things to study the fundamental reasons for the development of things.

If we do not just focus on these short few months, but examine the entire history of metal processing development, we can find that the emergence of "chipless processing" today is an inevitable result of the forward development of things according to the law of affirmation and negation. In the history of machine manufacturing, mankind started with the manufacture of simple tools. The metal daily tools or agricultural tools produced in the beginning were generally used directly after being cast and forged, without cutting processing (at most, they were polished or trimmed). This is the original "chipless processing." The advantage of this processing is that it is economical and convenient, but it is rough and simple. With the development of production, production tools became more and more complex, the precision became higher and higher, and the amount of manual grinding labor became larger and larger. As a result, mechanical processing methods such as turning, planing, drilling, and grinding emerged. This is "chip-forming processing" produced on the basis of "chipless processing." Workpieces processed by the "chip-forming processing" method are far superior to workpieces processed by the original "chipless processing" and manual grinding in terms of precision, finish, and product performance.

However, as soon as "chip-forming processing" was born, it contained the factors that negate itself. That is: complex equipment, waste of metal and manpower. When "chip-forming processing" first appeared, how to obtain high-precision, high-finish workpieces and how to improve the quality of machines were the main issues of concern at the time. To solve this problem, people thought it was a matter of course to manufacture more equipment, cut off more metal, and use more manpower. However, with the development of the machine manufacturing industry, the equipment required for "chip-forming processing" has become more and more, and the amount of metal wasted has also become larger and larger. In this way, "chip-forming processing," which once played a huge role in promoting the history of machine manufacturing, is increasingly restricting the high-speed development of the machine manufacturing industry. People naturally considered how to use new technology and equipment to directly cast and forge precision workpieces without cutting processing. This led to the current "chipless processing." The current "chipless processing" is by no means a simple repetition of the original "chipless processing," it only repeats its simple, convenient, and economical characteristics, and also absorbs the advantages of high precision and high finish of "chip-forming processing," which is an advanced "chipless processing" at a higher technical level.

So, is it possible to skip the "chip-forming processing" stage and directly leap from the original "chipless processing" to the current "chipless processing"? As far as the entire development of machine manufacturing is concerned, this is impossible. Because: First, without the "chip-forming processing" stage, the requirements for the current "chipless processing" cannot be put forward; Second, the current "chipless processing" needs "chip-forming processing" to provide the material conditions for development. For example, the molds for precision casting, the forging dies for precision forging, and the die-casting machines for liquid forming must be manufactured through "chip-forming processing." The emergence and development of "chip-forming processing" in the past, like the emergence and development of "chipless processing" today, has its historical inevitability.

The important thing is that many people are currently bound by the traditional "blank manufacturing—machining—product assembly" process in the past machine manufacturing process and dare not boldly use and promote "chipless processing." They worry that after adopting
 "chipless processing," the accuracy of the workpiece will not be high and the product quality cannot be guaranteed. More and more facts show that this worry is unfounded. Except for a few shaft holes, the seeders produced by Harbin Songjiang Tractor Factory are all made by "chipless processing." However, the product quality is excellent and is well received by users. "Chipless processing" is by no means a temporary and unavoidable "poor method" as some people say; but an inevitable trend of the development of things according to the law of affirmation and negation.

Of course, the development of "chipless processing" does not completely exclude the existence of "chip-forming processing." "Chipless processing" negates the negative factors of "chip-forming processing," while preserving and developing its positive factors. "Chipless" and "chip-forming" complement each other and constantly improve the level of machine manufacturing. However, the trend of "chipless processing" gradually replacing "chip-forming processing" is inevitable.

The Promotion of “Chipless Processing” Will Have a Profound Impact

The emergence and promotion of "chipless processing" has a very far-reaching impact on the machine manufacturing industry. First of all, it will cause a series of changes in the machine manufacturing industry. From product design to production technology, from equipment configuration to enterprise management, corresponding adjustments need to be made to make the machine manufacturing production process simple and perfect. Casting, forging, stamping and other workshops will no longer be workshops that simply produce blanks, and their status in machine manufacturing plants will undergo fundamental changes. In the production of many parts, there is no longer a distinction between "rough machining" and "precision machining," so that both complete their "work" in one battle.

Secondly, the development of "chipless processing" will inevitably promote the technological revolution of casting and forging production itself. In order to replace "chip-forming processing," "chipless processing" must reach or exceed the level of "chip-forming processing" in terms of product quality indicators such as processing accuracy and finish. This requires the casting and forging process of producing blanks to greatly improve the quality of products. In addition, hot processing such as casting, forging, and welding has always been a weak link in the mechanical industry, and
 "chipless processing" itself saves a lot of cold processing production capacity and increases the task of hot processing. This further deepens the contradiction between cold and hot processing. The development of this contradiction promotes the production process of casting and forging, so that it carries out a thorough revolution in order to increase the number of products. The fact is that the creation of "chipless processing" technology enables the rapid promotion of "chipless processing" production, and the promotion of "chipless processing" promotes the further improvement of "chipless processing" technology and the further improvement of the degree of mechanization and automation of the "chipless processing" process.

Thirdly, the promotion of "chipless processing" has a great impetus to the whole people running industry and vigorously supporting agriculture. "Chipless processing" equipment is simple, and the process is easy for the masses to master, so machine manufacturing plants can be set up everywhere. Many agricultural machinery can almost all be manufactured using "chipless processing." This year, the whole country is supporting rural areas with a large number of machines and steel. After the promotion of "chipless processing," these materials will be used more fully.

In the first spring of the sixties of the continuous Great Leap Forward, the booming "chipless processing" movement in the mechanical manufacturing industry is not accidental. This is a new achievement of the whole people continuing to implement the Party's general line of socialist construction, and a new achievement of the broad masses of working people continuing to break superstitions and boldly carry out technological revolution. Because "chipless processing" conforms to the laws of the development of things and meets the requirements of more, faster, better, and more economical, it shows unlimited vitality as soon as it appears. It has developed itself and promoted the thorough revolution of the entire machine manufacturing process in solving the contradictions of insufficient equipment, manpower, and raw materials in various factories.

    “无屑加工”代替“有屑加工”是机械制造工业中的革命
    ·哈尔滨工业大学机械系铸工教研室·
    “无屑加工”是机械制造过程的一个革命
    多少年来，机器制造都沿用着这样一个“传统”的过程：先用铸、锻、焊等热加工方法制造出零件的毛坯，再经过车、铣、刨、钻等冷加工方法把毛坯加工成零件，最后将零件组装成机器。这样一来，在冷加工（即“有屑加工”）的过程中，毛坯上有20％—40％的金属白白地变成碎屑，同时还要有很多的金属切削机床和大量劳动力被用在这些毛坯的加工工作上；为了开动这些机器，每年还要消耗数量巨大的电能。
    “无屑加工”就是采取各种先进的铸锻、冲压、粉末冶金、精拔、精轧等工艺，大力提高毛坯的精度，节省大量的机械加工（即冷加工、“有屑加工”）的时间、动力、设备、金属原材料和人力，而由锻铸零件直接组装成机器。这样就使机器制造过程大大简化了，从而就大大地提高了劳动生产率。
    以哈尔滨市建成机械厂为例，这个厂从1958年生产201型电瓶车以来，生产任务不断增长，机械加工设备和劳动力不足的矛盾越来越突出。为解决这个问题，他们曾经寻找了不少提高机械加工生产率的途径，推广了许多先进经验，并且使产量提高了十二倍，但仍然不能满足用车部门的需要。今年春天，他们把电瓶车的90％多的部件都采用“无屑加工”后，就节省了四十二台切削机床，一百六十多名技术工人和八百九十平方米的生产场地；今年内，还可节省四百六十吨金属材料。因此，“无屑加工”一出现，就具有强大的生命力，受到了上级党委的极大重视与广大职工的热烈欢迎。不久以后，哈尔滨市的很多工厂开始用“无屑加工”制作五十马力卷扬机、水轮机、空气压缩机等机械部件。哈尔滨第一机械厂用“无屑加工”铸造的齿轮，精度和光洁度达到了精车的水平。人们的思想越干越解放，越干越敢干。很多工厂从改设计，割“盲肠”入手，根据不同生产特点改进工卡具，应用新工艺，并且广泛地使用新材料，以铁代钢，以塑料代金属，以低熔点材料代高熔点材料。到5月末为止，全市已有二百七十九种机械中的九千八百样部件的生产，实现了“无屑加工”。
    加工的“无屑—有屑—无屑”体现了事物发展的肯定否定规律
    既然“有屑加工”麻烦，为什么当初会产生这种加工方法？今天为什么又要走向“无屑加工”？这是在推广“无屑加工”中必须回答的问题。
    毛主席曾经告诉过我们，要从事物的内部，从一事物对他事物的关系去研究事物的发展，从事物内部的矛盾性去研究事物发展的根本原因。
    如果我们不只是着眼于这短短的几个月，而是考察一下整个金属加工的发  展历史，就可以发现“无屑加工”在今天的出现，是事物按照肯定否定的规律向前发展的必然结果。在机器制造史上，人类是从制造简单的工具开始的。最初生产出来的金属日用工具或农具，一般都是在铸出、锻出后就直接使用，不经过切削加工（至多磨一磨或修饰一下）。这就是原始的“无屑加工”。这样加工的好处是：经济、方便，但是粗糙、简单。随着生产的发展，生产工具越来越复杂，精度越来越高，用手工修磨的劳动量越来越大，于是，就产生了车、刨、钻、磨等机械加工方法。这是从“无屑加工”的基础上产生的“有屑加工”。用“有屑加工”的方法加工出来的工件，无论在精密度和光洁度，或产品的性能方面，都远非原始“无屑加工”和手工修磨的工件所能比拟的。
    然而，“有屑加工”一诞生，就包含着否定本身的因素。这就是：设备复杂，浪费金属和人力。在“有屑加工”刚刚出现的时候，如何得到高精度、高光洁度的工件，如何提高机器的质量，是人们当时所关心的主要问题。为解决这一问题，多制造一些设备，多削去一些金属，多用一些人力，人们认为是理所当然的事。但是，随着机器制造工业的发展，“有屑加工”所需的设备越来越多，浪费掉的金属量也越来越大。这样，曾经在机器制造历史上起过巨大推动作用的“有屑加工”，越来越束缚着机器制造工业的高速发展。人们便很自然地考虑到怎样运用新的技术设备，不经过切削加工，直接铸、锻出精密的工件。这就出现了目前的“无屑加工”。目前的“无屑加工”绝不是原始的“无屑加工”的简单重复，只是重复了它的简单、方便、经济的特点，同时也吸取了“有屑加工”的高精度、高光洁度的优点，在更高技术水平上的高级的“无屑加工”。
    那么，是不是可以不经过“有屑加工”阶段而直接由原始的“无屑加工”跃进到目前的“无屑加工”呢？就整个机器制造的发展来说，这是不可能的。因为：第一，不经过“有屑加工”阶段，也提不出目前“无屑加工”的要求；第二，目前的“无屑加工”需要有屑加工提供物质条件才能发展。如精密铸造的铸型，精密锻造的锻模，液态成型的压铸机等都要通过“有屑加工”才能制造出来。过去“有屑加工”的出现和发展，正像今天“无屑加工”的出现和发展一样，是有它的历史必然性的。
    重要的是，目前有许多人受着过去机器制造过程中“毛坯制造—机械加工—产品装配”的传统束缚，不敢大胆使用和推广“无屑加工”。他们担心采用
  “无屑加工”后，工件精度不高，不能保证产品质量。越来越多的事实说明这种耽心是没有根据的。哈尔滨松江拖拉机厂生产的播种机，除了几个轴孔外，都是采用的“无屑加工”。但产品质量优良，深受用户欢迎。“无屑加工”绝不像某些人所说的那样，是暂时的、不得已的“穷办法”；而是事物按照肯定否定规律发展的一种必然趋势。
    当然，“无屑加工”的发展并不完全排斥“有屑加工”的存在。“无屑加工”否定了“有屑加工”的消极因素，而保存和发展了它的积极因素。“无屑”、“有屑”相辅相成，不断提高机器制造水平。但是“无屑加工”逐步取代“有屑加工”的趋势是必然的。
    “无屑加工”的推广将产生深远的影响
    “无屑加工”的出现和推广，在机器制造业中的影响是非常深远的。首先，它将在机器制造工业中引起一系列的变革。从产品设计到生产工艺，从设备配置到企业管理，都需要做相应的调整，使机器制造的生产过程简单而又完善。铸、锻、冲压等车间将不再是单纯生产毛坯的车间，它们在机器制造厂中的地位将产生根本的变化。在许多部件的生产中，再没有“粗加工”和“精加工”的区别，而使两者毕其“工”于一役。
    其次，“无屑加工”的发展必将促进铸、锻生产本身的技术革命。“无屑加工”要取代“有屑加工”，就必须在加工精度、光洁度等产品质量指标方面达到或者超过“有屑加工”的水平。这就要求生产毛坯的铸、锻工艺大大提高产品的质量。此外，铸、锻、焊等热加工，素来是机械工业中的薄弱环节，而
  “无屑加工”本身又节省了大量的冷加工的生产能力，增加了热加工的任务。这就更进一步加深了冷热加工之间的矛盾。这个矛盾的发展，就推动了铸、锻等生产过程，使之为提高产品数量而进行彻底革命。事实正是这样，“无屑加工”工艺的创造，使“无屑加工”的生产迅速推广，“无屑加工”的推广，又促使“无屑加工”工艺的进一步完善，促使“无屑加工”过程的机械化自动化程度进一步提高。
    再次，“无屑加工”的推广对全民办工业，大力支援农业有很大推动作用。“无屑加工”的设备简单，工艺容易被群众掌握，因此，机械制造厂到处可办。很多农业机械，几乎可以全部采用“无屑加工”来制造。今年全国正以大量的机器和钢材支援农村，在推广“无屑加工”后，这些物资将得到更充分的运用。
    在持续大跃进的六十年代的第一个春天，在机械制造工业中出现蓬勃发展的“无屑加工”运动，这不是偶然的。这是全民继续贯彻执行党的社会主义建设总路线的新的成果，也是广大劳动人民继续破除迷信，大胆进行技术革命的新的成果。因为“无屑加工”符合事物发展的规律，符合多快好省的要求，所以它一出现就显示出了无限的生命力。它在解决着各个厂设备、人力、原材料不足的矛盾中，发展了自己，也促进了整个机器制造过程的彻底革命。
