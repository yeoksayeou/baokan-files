    Diligence and Thrift Create a Great Undertaking
    —An Account of How the Jinxing People's Commune in Wannian County Transformed from Poor to Rich
    The Jinxing People's Commune in Wannian County, Jiangxi Province, is a good example of running a commune through diligence and thrift. The cadres and members of this commune always regard diligence and thrift as an important criterion in evaluating people and events. The spirit of diligence and thrift, like a red thread stringing pearls together, has brought one bumper harvest after another to the entire commune. In just two years, it has transformed this formerly poorest commune in the county into one of the famous wealthy communes.
　  Thrifty and Diligent "Housekeepers"
    The tremendous changes in this commune are inseparable from a group of good managers.
    Arriving at the Jinxing Commune, one immediately gets an impression of hard work and simplicity. The commune's location was originally two civilian houses and a dozen pigsty houses that were renovated, with a small auditorium in the middle that could seat about a hundred people. On both sides were some simple rooms. The small auditorium was called the "multi-purpose auditorium" by the commune members, serving as a meeting place, a dining hall, and a storage room. There were twelve rooms on both sides of the auditorium, six of which were offices, and the other six were cadre dormitories. From the Party Committee Secretary and the Commune Director to the general cadres, many shared a room with two, three, or even five or six people. Fifteen comrades working at the grassroots level didn't even have a bed, and had to find a place to sleep at the iron and steel plant or school whenever they came to the commune for meetings. These comrades never complained.
    Once, a comrade from the County Party Committee work team casually asked the office clerk: "Your rooms are so cramped, why don't you find a way to build a building?" The clerk said: "We have the money. Not to mention building one, we could build three or four." So why not build it? In the words of Li Yishu, the First Secretary of the Party Committee, everything is for production, everything is subordinate to production, and every penny must be considered beneficial to production.
    There are 339 cadres above the production team level in the entire commune. They are all dedicated to production, and in one year, each person worked an average of 240 workdays. In participating in and leading production, they have become models of diligence and thrift. Li Yishu, the First Secretary of the Commune Party Committee, worked as a farmhand for twenty-four years in the old society. He is a common laborer who never fades, always barefoot, with his trouser legs rolled up, taking the lead in participating in production. If he finds a little cow dung scattered on the road, he will naturally kick it into the field. He always thinks about whether he can use fewer people and spend less money on everything. In the process of building the Tongyuan Reservoir, after two surveys and designs by the water conservancy department, he proposed three more revisions. According to the reservoir's terrain, water storage area, and water storage capacity calculations, the dam width was changed from 87 meters to 74 meters, and the inner and outer slopes were reduced, which could still ensure the quality of the project. This modification saved 12,000 workdays and ensured that the water conservancy project would benefit the community that year. His thrifty style set an example for cadres at all levels. Hu Xuexiang, the Deputy Secretary of the Commune, and Cao Yiming, the Commune Director, caught four carp while working with commune members to operate a waterwheel. They were reluctant to eat them and took them to the commune's "July 1st" Reservoir to raise. Now the reservoir is full of fish fry, and the story of "starting a business with four carp" is still circulating in the commune.
    The cadres of this commune not only manage the collective enterprise with practical actions of diligence and thrift, but also set an example of hard work and simplicity in their personal lives. In the past two years, none of the cadres above the production team level have borrowed money from the commune. The cadres' style has also influenced the masses. Every family lives a rich life as if it were a poor life. The commune members have also deposited their surplus money in the credit cooperative. More than 1,500 households in the commune have participated in savings, and the total amount of deposits has increased two times compared to 1958.
    Increased Production, Less Spending
    This commune has increased production year after year, without expanding production investment, and the production costs have been greatly reduced. In 1958, production costs accounted for 17.1% of the total annual income. According to the final accounting results of last year, production costs accounted for only 7.7% of the total income; income increased by 63% compared to 1958, while expenditure decreased by 43.8%. Why is there increased production with less spending? The main reason is that they are careful and meticulous everywhere. Taking fertilizer expenditure as an example, they have always adhered to this principle: accumulate more farm manure and buy less commercial fertilizer. The Shangding Brigade needed to buy 1,360 yuan worth of commercial fertilizer according to the allocation from higher authorities, but actually only bought 850 yuan; the Dahuan Brigade spent 2,422 yuan on commercial fertilizer in 1958, but only spent 1,800 yuan last year. In terms of adding and repairing agricultural tools, they made full use of existing agricultural tools and did not add new ones unless absolutely necessary. At the same time, they mobilized the masses to repair them themselves. The Shangding Brigade originally planned to hire carpenters for 371 workdays, bamboo weavers for 176 workdays, and blacksmiths for 93 workdays to repair agricultural tools, at an expenditure of 622 yuan. After mobilizing the masses to become "all-rounders," the expenditure dropped to 414 yuan, saving 33.4% compared to the original plan. In the past, the Dahuan Brigade bought basket ropes with money, but last year, more than 180 dan of basket ropes were made by the masses themselves. This item alone saved more than 80 yuan.
    They not only paid attention to diligence and thrift in major production expenditures, but also did a meticulous job in small office expenses such as pens, ink, paper, and other office expenses. All levels of expenditure from the brigade to the team implemented a quota system. For example, the administrative management expenses of each brigade cannot exceed 0.5% of the total income, and the brigade only allocates less than 0.5 yuan per month to each production team for expenses. The commune's office expenses are also strictly controlled, and anything that is not necessary will not be used.
      Careful Calculation of Labor Arrangement
    The Jinxing Commune regards labor as the most valuable asset. Rationally arranging labor and improving labor efficiency is the greatest saving in the work of running a commune diligently and thriftily. All the able-bodied and semi-able-bodied laborers in the commune are assigned long-term or seasonal tasks according to their technical expertise and the agricultural season, so that everyone can do their best and no household is idle. Their use of labor is not only appropriately arranged for regular agricultural activities, but also carefully calculated for temporary emergency tasks or large-scale basic construction. They arrange how much is needed and when it is needed. For example, in building the "July 1st" Reservoir, the dam head of this reservoir is not wide, the construction surface is not large, and too much labor cannot be used. They adopted the method of arranging labor in stages: when clearing the foundation and building the core wall, only 100 people were drawn to the construction site; when building the dam and transporting earth, 400 laborers were drawn, divided into four soil extraction areas; this avoided mutual interference and reduced work efficiency. Finally, only 100 people were left to do the finishing work of protecting the embankment. Due to strict organization and reasonable arrangements, on average, only 300 laborers were drawn for three months to complete the construction of a water conservancy project that irrigates more than 10,000 mu of farmland. On the basis of rationally arranging labor, they also pay special attention to improving labor efficiency, so that the road is not empty and the burden is not empty. Here you can often see: people come with one burden and go back with one burden, and when they send a burden of fertilizer up the slope, they have a burden of turf to take home. The commune also mobilized the masses to carry out a tool innovation movement. The masses created a dryland seeder that can sow twelve mu in one day, which is six times more efficient than manual sowing in the past. Without a deep plowing plow, they installed two plows on the old plow, turning the shallow plowing plow into a deep plowing plow, and increasing the depth from the original four inches to eight inches. In addition, careful planning has also saved a lot of labor. There is a lime factory and a coal kiln here, twelve li apart. Every year, millions of catties of coal are transported to the lime factory, and the lime produced by the lime factory must be transported to various production teams. If transported separately, a large number of laborers will be occupied. The Dahuan Brigade is the location of the coal kiln. They drew more than a dozen local trucks to undertake this transportation task. Year after year, they go full of coal and return loaded with lime, which not only saves labor but also ensures the coal needed for industry and the lime needed for agriculture in a timely manner. The great significance of improving labor efficiency is as the masses said: "In the past, there was this much labor, and there is still this much labor now, but in the past it was not enough to only grow crops, and now industry, agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries all need people. If we don't rely on improving labor efficiency, how can we be busy enough!"
      Preliminary Blueprint
    When the People's Commune was first established, many people said that the Jinxing Commune was a "poor den commune," because there were particularly many poor teams in the entire commune (out of 35 brigades, 17 were poor teams). The entire commune was full of barren hills and ridges, and barren land, either afraid of drought or afraid of flooding. 60% were yellow mud fields, and 30% were iron plate sand fields. These fields are not inferior when planting seedlings, but the yield is very low. However, under the superior conditions of the People's Commune, relying on the diligent and thrifty efforts of the people, everything has changed. Looking around, a beautiful picture is displayed everywhere: the mountains have changed. Every piece of mountain land is planted with pine, fir, oil tea, fruit trees, and bamboo, which have become a verdant forest; the water has changed. The clear water flows down from more than 40 reservoirs and flows into more than 30,000 mu of rice fields through melon-vine-style channels; the fields have also changed. Lean fields have become fertile fields, one season has been changed to two seasons, and low yields have jumped to high yields.
    This place was a grain-deficient area before 1958, but last year it sold 5,325,000 catties of surplus grain; in previous years, it relied on foreign supply of edible oil, but last year, in addition to self-sufficiency, it also sold 15,500 catties of oil to the state; industry was originally a blank piece of paper. In the past two years, the commune-run industry serving agricultural production has been actively developed. In 1959, the total industrial output value reached more than 400,000 yuan.
    Production is changing, and the living conditions of the commune members are also changing. In 1959, 98% of the commune members increased their income compared to 1958, catching up with the living standards of the local well-to-do middle peasants. In the first half of this year, each brigade implemented a system of monthly or bi-monthly advances. By August, the income distributed to commune members reached 772,000 yuan, with an average net income of 51.3 yuan per person, and 99% of the commune members increased their income on the basis of last year.

    勤俭创大业
    ——记万年县金星人民公社由穷变富
    江西万年县金星人民公社是勤俭办社的好榜样。这个公社的干部和社员，在评人论事中，总是把勤俭作为一条重要准则；克勤克俭的风气，就像红线串珍珠一样，给全社带来了一个丰收又一个丰收。仅仅在两年中，把这个全县最穷的公社变成了著名的富裕公社之一。
　  克勤克俭的“管家人”
    这个社的巨大变化，是和一伙好当家分不开的。
    走到金星公社，就给人一种艰苦朴素的印象。这个公社所在地，原是二幢民房和十几间猪栏屋改修的，中间是一个能坐百把人的小礼堂，两边隔了些简陋的房间。小礼堂被社员称做“万能礼堂”，既是会场，又是膳厅，还是保管室。礼堂两边共有十二个房间，其中有六间是办公室，另外六间是干部寝室。从党委书记、公社社长到一般干部，多是二、三人以至五、六个人共住一间房。还有十五个在基层工作的同志，连个床铺都没有，每次到公社开会就得到炼铁厂或学校里搭铺。这些同志从来没有怨言。
    有一次，县委工作组的同志，随便问了一下办公室的文书：“你们的房子这样紧，为啥不想办法盖一幢呢？”文书说：“钱是有的，莫说盖一幢，就是盖三幢、四幢也足够。”那为什么不盖呢？用党委第一书记李宜恕同志的话来说，就是一切为了生产，一切服从生产，用一分一厘钱，都要考虑有利于生产。
    全社生产队以上的干部有三百三十九人，他们都全心全意为生产，在一年中，平均每人做了二百四十个劳动日。在参加生产、领导生产中，他们成了克勤克俭的模范。公社党委第一书记李宜恕同志，在旧社会打了二十四年长工，他是一个永不褪色的普通劳动者，总是打着赤脚，卷着裤腿，带头参加生产。如果发现路上撒了一点牛粪，他总是自然而然地把它拨到田里去。遇事他都要想一想：是否能少用些人，少花点钱？在兴建桐沅水库的过程中，水利部门两次勘测设计之后，又在他的建议下进行了三次修改，根据水库地形、蓄水面积和蓄水量计算，将坝宽八十七米改为七十四米，里外坡度减少，同样可以保证工程质量。经过这一修改，节省一万二千个工，并保证了水利当年受益。他的勤俭作风，给各级干部树立了榜样。公社副书记胡雪香、社长曹义明在和社员一起车水时，曾车出四条亲鲤鱼，他们都舍不得吃，拿到公社的“七一”水库去放养。现在这个水库里鱼苗满库了，公社里还流传着“四条鲤鱼起家”的故事。
    这个社的干部，不仅用勤俭的实际行动来经营着集体事业，而且在个人生活上也是艰苦朴素的榜样。两年来，生产队以上的干部，没有一个向社里借钱的。干部的作风也影响了广大群众，家家都是把富日子当穷日子过，社员们还把多余的钱纷纷存到信用部里，全社有一千五百多户参加了储蓄，存款总额比1958年增长两倍。
    增产多　花钱少
    这个公社年年增产，不仅没有扩大生产投资，而且生产费用还大大节省了。1958年生产费用占全年总收入17.1％，去年年终决算结果，生产费用只占总收入7.7％；收入比1958年增加63％，而开支却下降了43.8％。为什么增产多花钱少？主要是他们处处精打细算。以肥料开支为例，他们始终坚持了这样一条原则：多积农家肥料，少买商品肥料。上丁大队按照上级分配的商品肥料需用一千三百六十元，而实际只买回了八百五十元；大黄大队1958年花在商品肥料上面的钱有二千四百二十二元，去年只用了一千八百元。在农具添修上，他们充分运用了旧有农具，不是万不得已就不添新的，同时，发动群众自己动手修理。上丁大队原来计划修补农具要请木工三百七十一个工，篾工一百七十六个工，铁工九十三个工，开支六百二十二元，经过发动群众做“多面手”之后，开支下降到四百一十四元，比原计划节省了33.4％。大黄大队过去箩绳拿钱买，去年一百八十多担箩绳都是群众自己搓出来的，光这一项，就节约了八十多元。
    他们不仅在生产的大宗开支方面注意了勤俭节约，而且在笔墨纸张等细小的办公费用开支上，也做到了精打细算。从大队到小组各级开支都实行了定额包干。如各大队的行政管理费用不能超过总收入0.5％，大队对各生产小队的开支，每月只包干在五角钱以内。公社的办公费用，也严格控制，不当用的就坚决不用。
      安排劳力精打细算
    金星公社把劳动力视为最宝贵的财产。合理安排劳动力，提高劳动效率，是勤俭办社工作中一项最大的节约。全社所有的整半劳动力，根据每人的技术特长和农事季节，实行了长年或季节的分工，做到人尽其力、家家户户无闲人。他们对劳动力的使用，不仅对经常性的农事活动进行了恰当的安排，而且对临时性突击任务或大型基本建设所需要的劳动力，也是精打细算，需要多少就安排多少，什么时候需要就什么时候上去。譬如兴修“七一”水库，这座水库坝首不宽，施工面不大，劳动力不能上的太多，他们就采取分期安排劳动力的办法：在清基筑核心墙时，只抽了一百人上工地；筑库坝运土工程大，就抽调了四百个劳动力，分为四个取土区工作；这样就避免互相影响，降低工效，最后只留了一百人做收尾护堤工作。由于组织严密，安排合理，三个月的时间，平均只抽了三百个劳动力，就将一座灌溉万亩田以上的水利工程全部竣工。在合理安排劳动力的基础上，他们还特别注意提高劳动效率，做到路不空行，担不空回。这里常常可以看到：人们一担来，一担去，送一担肥上坂，就有一担草皮回家。这个公社还发动了广大群众开展了工具革新运动。群众创造了一种旱地播种机，一天可以播种十二亩，比过去人工播种效率提高六倍。没有深耕犁，他们就在老式犁上安两个犁头，使浅耕犁变为深耕犁，深度由原来四寸提高到八寸。此外由于计划周到，也节省了很多的劳力。这里有个石灰厂和一个煤窑，两地相隔十二华里，每年有几百万斤煤炭运往石灰厂，石灰厂生产出来的石灰又要运送到各个生产队，如果单项运输，就要占用大批劳动力。大黄大队是煤窑的所在地，他们抽调了十多部土车子，担负了这项运输任务，经年累月，都是满载煤炭而去，装运石灰回来，既节省了劳动力，又及时保证了工业用煤和农业需要的石灰。提高劳动效率的巨大意义，正如群众所说的：“过去是这么多劳动力，现在也是这么多劳动力，而过去光种田还嫌不够，现在工、农、林、牧、副、渔样样都要人，不是靠提高劳动效率，怎么能忙得过来呀！”
      初展鸿图
    在刚成立人民公社的时候，许多人都说金星公社是个“穷窝社”，这是因为全社的穷队特别多（三十五个大队，就有十七个大队是穷队）。全社到处都是荒山秃岭，贫瘠的土地，不是怕旱、就是怕涝。有60％属黄泥田，30％是铁板沙田，这种田在插下秧时，并不逊色，但产量很低。但在人民公社的优越条件下，依靠着人们克勤克俭的努力，一切都变样了。举目一望，到处展现着一幅美丽的景象：山变了，这里的每一块山地，全栽上了松树、杉树、油茶、果木、山竹，简直成了翠绿的林海；水变了，清清的流水，从四十多座水库中下来，通过瓜藤式的渠道，向三万多亩稻田流进去；田也变了，瘦田变成了肥田，一季改成双季，低产跃为高产。
    这里1958年以前还是个缺粮地方，去年却卖出余粮五百三十二万五千斤；历年依靠外地供应食油，去年除自给外，还卖给国家油脂一万五千五百斤；工业原来是一张白纸，两年来，积极发展了为农业生产服务的社办工业，1959年工业总产值就达四十多万元。
    生产在变，社员的生活状况也在变。1959年有98％的社员比1958年增加了收入，赶上了当地富裕中农的生活水平。今年上半年，各个大队分别实行按月预支或双月预支的制度，到8月份为止，分给社员的收入达七十七万二千元，每人平均纯收入五十一元三角，又有99％的社员在去年的基础上增加了收入。
