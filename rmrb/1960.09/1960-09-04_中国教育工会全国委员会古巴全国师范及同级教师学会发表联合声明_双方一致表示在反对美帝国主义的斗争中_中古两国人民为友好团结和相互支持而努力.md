Xinhua News Agency, 3rd. Joint Statement of the National Committee of the Chinese Education Union and the Cuban National Association of Teachers of Normal and Equivalent Schools

At the invitation of the National Committee of the Chinese Education Union, the delegation of the Cuban National Association of Teachers of Normal and Equivalent Schools, headed by Leslie Rodriguez Aguilera, President of the Cuban National Association of Teachers of Normal and Equivalent Schools, visited the People's Republic of China in August 1960 after attending the Third World Teachers' Conference held in Conakry (capital of Guinea).

The Cuban Association of Teachers of Normal and Equivalent Schools (hereinafter referred to as the Cuban Teachers Association) was pleased to see the great achievements made by the Chinese people in economic construction under the wise leadership of Chairman Mao Zedong, the vigorous development of cultural, educational, and scientific undertakings, and the significant improvement of people's lives; and believes that under the brilliant guidance of the general line for socialist construction, the Chinese people will surely achieve greater achievements. During the visit, the leaders of the Chinese Education Union and the Cuban Teachers Association held cordial talks and unanimously agreed to issue the following joint statement.

I

The Chinese Education Union and the Cuban Teachers Association unanimously condemn the series of military threats, economic blockades, and subversive sabotage activities carried out by U.S. imperialism against the Cuban people after the Cuban revolution, especially the recent "Declaration of San Jose" through the Foreign Ministers' Conference of the Organization of American States, actively stepping up the heinous conspiracy of armed intervention in Cuba. In this declaration, U.S. imperialism reversed black and white, and accused Cuba, which was being interfered with and invaded, of interfering in the internal affairs of other countries and endangering the unity and security of the Americas. These activities fully expose the evil intentions of U.S. imperialism to strangle the Cuban revolution and suppress the increasingly high tide of the national democratic movement in Latin American countries.

Both sides sternly condemn: U.S. imperialism's occupation of China's territory of Taiwan, its continuous violation of China's territorial waters and airspace, creating tension in the Taiwan Strait, and once again rudely rejecting the recent proposal by the Premier of the People's Republic of China on the conclusion of a treaty of non-aggression and peace between countries in Asia and the Pacific region (including the United States); signing the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty with the Japanese government; attempting to use the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization to step up interference in the internal affairs of Laos, preventing Laos from taking the road of peace and neutrality; using the signboard of the United Nations to openly and blatantly interfere in the internal affairs of the Congo, violating the sovereignty of the Congo; and after undermining the summit conference of the four heads of government and the ten-nation disarmament conference, it is even more openly engaging in arms expansion and war preparation.

Both sides unanimously pointed out: The above-mentioned evil activities of U.S. imperialism further prove that it is not only the most ferocious enemy of the Cuban people and the Latin American people, but also the most ferocious enemy of the Chinese people and the people of Asian and African countries, and the common enemy of all peace-loving people in the world.

II

Both sides unanimously believe that the victory of the Cuban people's revolution has dealt a heavy blow to U.S. imperialism, the enemy of world peace. The Revolution has set a brilliant example for the Latin American people to strive to get rid of American control, and encouraged the struggle of people of all countries in the world to strive for peace and oppose imperialist aggression. Under the leadership of Prime Minister Fidel Castro, the Cuban people have carried out a vigorous land reform and have already achieved great results, taken over many American companies that plundered Cuban wealth, resolutely suppressed the subversive activities of counter-revolutionary forces, and national economy and national culture and education have developed rapidly.

Chinese educators, like the people of the whole country, firmly support the just struggle of the Cuban people, and regard the struggle and victory of the Cuban people as their own struggle and victory. Every achievement of the heroic Cuban people is a strong support for the Chinese people.

The Cuban Teachers Association expressed its firm support for the just struggle of the Chinese people to liberate Taiwan and oppose imperialist aggression.

III

The Cuban Teachers Association calls on teachers in Latin America and the world to carry out active actions to support the Cuban people's struggle to defend the revolution and oppose U.S. imperialist intervention. Chinese educators warmly support this just demand of Cuban teachers.

Both sides are satisfied to see the positive response of the Seventh American Teachers' Conference held in Lima, Peru in January 1960 to this call. At the Third World Teachers' Conference held in Conakry in July 1960, educators from all over the world unanimously expressed their support for the Cuban revolution and condemned U.S. imperialist threats and interventions against Cuba.

At the Third World Teachers' Conference, representatives from various countries exposed that imperialist forces, headed by the United States, are carrying out political and economic aggression under the guise of "aid" through their agents in various countries, while using various educational organizations and propaganda tools to carry out cultural aggression, and doing their utmost to destroy and eliminate the national cultures and traditions of various countries. The conference called on educators all over the world to unite with the working class to fight against imperialist aggression, strive for and defend national independence, democratic freedom, defend national culture and strive for world peace. Both sides expressed satisfaction with the resolutions of this conference and are determined to work together to implement these resolutions.

IV

Both sides are satisfied to see that the struggle against the common enemy—U.S. imperialism—has made the friendship and mutual support between the people of China and Cuba grow. The visit of the delegation of the Cuban Teachers Association to the People's Republic of China in August 1960 and the signing of the joint statement further strengthened the friendly relations between the people of China and Cuba.

Both sides unanimously agreed to work to consolidate and continue to develop the friendly unity and mutual support between educators and people of the two countries, and continue to exchange delegations and exchange experiences in trade union activities and education. Both sides firmly believe that the growing friendly relations between Chinese and Cuban teachers' organizations will promote the unity of educators in Asia and Latin America and make a positive contribution to strengthening the unity of educators in the world.

    新华社3日讯　中国教育工会全国委员会、古巴全国师范及同级教师学会联合声明
    以古巴全国师范及同级教师学会主席莱斯里·罗德里格斯·阿吉莱拉为首的古巴全国师范及同级教师学会代表团，于出席在科纳克里
  （几内亚首都）举行的第三届世界教师大会后，应中国教育工会全国委员会的邀请，在1960年8月访问了中华人民共和国。
    古巴师范及同级教师学会（以下简称古巴教师学会）高兴地看到了中国人民在毛泽东主席的英明领导下，在经济建设方面取得了伟大成就，文化、教育、科学事业蓬勃发展，人民生活有了显著的改善；并相信在社会主义建设总路线的光辉照耀下，中国人民必将取得更大的成就。在访问期间，中国教育工会和古巴教师学会的领导人进行了亲切的会谈，并一致同意发表以下联合声明。
    一
    中国教育工会和古巴教师学会一致谴责美帝国主义在古巴革命后对古巴人民进行的一系列军事威胁、经济封锁和颠复破坏活动，特别是美国最近胁迫美洲国家组织外长会议通过了一个反对古巴的所谓“圣约瑟宣言”，积极加紧策划武装干涉古巴的罪恶阴谋。在这个宣言中，美帝国主义颠倒黑白，给被干涉、被侵略的古巴安上了干涉别国内政、危害美洲团结和安全的罪名。这些活动，充分暴露了美帝国主义企图扼杀古巴革命和镇压拉丁美洲各国日益高涨的民族民主运动的罪恶目的。
    双方严厉谴责：美帝国主义霸占中华人民共和国领土台湾，不断侵犯中国领海和领空，制造台湾海峡地区的紧张局势，又一次横蛮地拒绝了中华人民共和国总理最近提出的关于亚洲和太平洋地区国家（包括美国在内）缔结一项互不侵犯的和平公约的建议；和日本政府签订了美日军事同盟条约；正在企图利用东南亚条约组织加紧干涉老挝内政，阻止老挝走和平中立的道路；利用联合国的招牌，公开露骨地干涉刚果的内政，侵犯刚果的主权；在破坏了四国政府首脑会议和十国裁军会议以后，更露骨地进行扩军备战。
    双方一致指出：美帝国主义的上述罪恶活动更加证明了它不仅是古巴人民和拉丁美洲人民的最凶恶的敌人，是中国和亚洲、非洲各国人民的最凶恶的敌人，也是全世界一切爱好和平人民的共同敌人。
    二
    双方一致认为，古巴人民革命的胜利是对于世界和平的敌人美帝国主义的沉重打击，它为拉丁美洲人民争取摆脱美国控制的斗争树立了光辉的榜样，鼓舞了世界各国人民争取和平，反对帝国主义侵略的斗争。古巴人民在菲德尔·卡斯特罗总理的领导下，进行了轰轰烈烈的土地改革，并已经取得巨大成果，接管了许多掠夺古巴财富的美国企业，坚决地镇压了反革命势力的颠复活动，民族经济和民族文化教育有了迅速的发展。
    中国教育工作者和全国人民一样坚决支持古巴人民的正义斗争，并把古巴人民的斗争和胜利看作是自己的斗争和胜利，英勇的古巴人民的每一个成就都是对于中国人民有力的支持。
    古巴教师学会表示坚决支持中国人民解放台湾、反对帝国主义侵略的正义斗争。
    三
    古巴教师学会呼吁拉丁美洲和全世界教师开展积极行动，支持古巴人民保卫革命、反对美帝国主义干涉的斗争。中国教育工作者热烈支持古巴教师的这一正义要求。
    双方满意地看到1960年1月在秘鲁利马举行的美洲第七届教师会议对这一呼吁的积极的反应，在1960年7月在科纳克里举行的第三届世界教师大会上，世界各国教育工作者一致表示支持古巴革命，谴责美帝国主义对古巴进行威胁和干涉。
    在第三届世界教师大会上，各国代表揭露了以美国为首的帝国主义势力在“援助”的幌子下，通过它们在各国的代理人，在进行政治、经济侵略的同时，利用各种教育组织和宣传工具，进行文化侵略，竭力破坏和消灭各国民族文化和传统。大会号召全世界教育工作者与工人阶级联合起来，为反对帝国主义侵略，争取和保卫民族独立、民主自由，保卫民族文化和争取世界和平而斗争。双方对这次大会的决议表示满意，并决心为实现这些决议而共同努力。
    四
    双方满意地看到反对共同敌人——美帝国主义的斗争使中国和古巴两国人民之间的友谊和相互支援日益发展。1960年8月古巴教师学会代表团对中华人民共和国的访问和联合声明的签订，进一步加强了中古两国人民的友好关系。
    双方一致同意，将为巩固和继续发展两国教育工作者和人民的友好团结和相互支持而努力，继续交换代表团，交流工会活动和教育方面的经验。双方坚信，中国和古巴教师组织日益增长的友好关系，将会促进亚洲和拉丁美洲教育工作者的团结，为加强世界教育工作者的团结作出积极贡献。
