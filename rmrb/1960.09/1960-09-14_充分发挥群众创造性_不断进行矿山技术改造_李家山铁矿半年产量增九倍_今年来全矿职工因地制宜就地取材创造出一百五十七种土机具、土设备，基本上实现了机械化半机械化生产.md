Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, September 13th. The Lijiashan Iron Mine in Leshan Prefecture, Sichuan Province, has relied on its own efforts to continuously carry out technical transformation, increasing the production of iron ore more than ninefold in a short period of six months, setting a red flag for the technical transformation of mines. The Sichuan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China has called on all coal mines and iron mines in the province to learn from the Lijiashan Mine.

Since the beginning of this year, the workers of this mine have created 157 kinds of indigenous machines and equipment by adapting to local conditions and using local materials, basically realizing mechanized and semi-mechanized production in this mine, which was originally mined mainly by manual labor. In July, the entire mine reduced its workforce by 20% compared to January, while the average daily output of ore increased from 1,120 tons to 11,232 tons, the overall employee efficiency increased from 0.61 tons to 7.6 tons, the average daily ore transport volume increased from 429 tons to 2,289 tons, and the cost per ton of ore decreased from 8.91 yuan to 3.87 yuan. Due to the substantial increase in ore production and transport volume, the entire mine has completed its annual production plan ahead of schedule and overfulfilled it, effectively ensuring the continuous growth of blast furnace production at the Leshan Iron and Steel Plant.

The Lijiashan Iron Mine was built during the Great Leap Forward in 1958. The technical transformation of this mine has gone through two paths: one was the path of seeking big and foreign equipment and waiting for equipment; the other was the path of relying on its own efforts, mainly on indigenous methods, and combining indigenous and foreign methods. In 1959, some leaders of the mine sought big and "foreign" equipment, emphasizing poor conditions and not actively carrying out technical revolution through self-reliance. They simply waited for "foreign machines" to transform the mine. Because the ordering and manufacturing of foreign equipment required a considerable amount of time and a large number of raw materials, the technical transformation last year, although it achieved certain successes, was not very effective. By the end of last year, the daily output of ore was still less than 1,000 tons, and the daily transport volume of ore was less than 400 tons, with more than 2,000 workers in the entire mine.

After summing up the experiences and lessons of last year, the Party Committee of the mine unanimously believed that to carry out transformation in a faster, better, and more economical way, it is necessary to resolutely implement the Party's policies: rely on the masses and be self-reliant. To be self-reliant, we must seek truth from facts, proceed from the existing conditions of the mine, simplify things, adapt to local conditions, carry out technical transformation, and realize mechanization and semi-mechanization by indigenous methods. The Party Committee of the mine mobilized the masses and launched a mass movement for technical revolution and technical transformation centered on vigorously promoting mechanization and semi-mechanization, and established bamboo rope factories and machine repair and woodworking workshops in a simple manner. They first focused on transforming the mine's transportation, which was characterized by high mountains, dangerous roads, and inconvenient transportation, as the main direction of attack, and vigorously grasped the construction of cableways and the reform of transportation tools. Without steel rails, they used wood from the mountains to make wooden rails; without steel wire ropes, they used bamboo ropes instead; without power, they made full use of the natural slope of the terrain and water power. In just two months, they erected 34 bamboo cableways with a total length of more than 7,000 meters, built more than 11,000 meters of wooden rails, winch tracks, earth chutes, and simple roads, and manufactured more than 290 various vehicles. The entire mine's transportation was realized through cableways, wooden rails, carts, chutes, and winches, eliminating the heavy physical labor of carrying on the back and shoulders. The number of transportation workers was reduced from more than 700 to more than 400, and the daily transport volume of ore quickly increased from more than 300 tons to more than 1,400 tons. The improvement of transportation efficiency greatly promoted the growth of ore production.

After the mine initially realized indigenous mechanized production, the Party Committee of the mine immediately proposed that in the past, we started with "indigenous methods," and now we must develop "indigenous methods," and gradually improve on the basis of "indigenous methods." The Party Committee mobilized the masses to appraise the existing indigenous machines and equipment, eliminate the backward ones, retain the advanced ones, and continue to consolidate and improve them, and organized the masses to vigorously promote the automation, linkage, double-tracking, and train formation of "indigenous methods" of production. As a result, the original technical innovation projects were further improved and the efficiency was further increased. For example, in terms of tunneling and mining, more efficient advanced machines such as bumping rod double hammers, automatic drill holders, universal drilling machines, and chain blasting appeared. In terms of cableway transportation, it has also developed from single-line cableways to multi-line cableways, from downhill cableways to over-the-mountain cableways, from manual loading and unloading and braking to automatic loading and unloading and braking, and has created some new tools with a higher level of automation, greatly improving the mine's level of mechanization.

Since the beginning of this year, the Party Committee of the Lijiashan Iron Mine has organized more than 90% of the cadres to the front line of production, adhered to the "four togethers," and led the technical transformation work, thus enabling the technical transformation of this mine to achieve outstanding achievements.

    充分发挥群众创造性　不断进行矿山技术改造
    李家山铁矿半年产量增九倍
    今年来全矿职工因地制宜就地取材创造出一百五十七种土机具、土设备，基本上实现了机械化半机械化生产
    新华社成都13日电　四川乐山专区李家山铁矿自力更生，不断进行技术改造，短短半年中铁矿石的产量提高九倍以上，为矿山的技术改造工作树立了一面红旗。中共四川省委号召全省所有煤矿、铁矿向李家山矿学习。
    今年以来，这个矿山的职工已经因地制宜、就地取材地创造出各种土机具、土设备一百五十七种，使这个原来主要是用人力开采的矿山，基本上实现了机械化、半机械化生产。全矿7月份比1月份减少了20％的人力，而矿石的平均日产量却由一千一百二十吨提高到一万一千二百三十二吨，全员工效由零点六一吨提高到七点六吨，矿石的平均日运量由四百二十九吨提高到二千二百八十九吨，每吨矿石成本由八点九一元降到三点八七元。由于矿石产量运量大幅度地上升，全矿已提前超额完成全年生产计划，有力地保证了乐山钢铁厂高炉生产不断增长的需要。
    李家山铁矿是1958年大跃进中建设起来的矿山。这个矿山的技术改造，曾走过两条道路，一条是贪大求洋坐等设备的道路；一条是自力更生以土为主土洋结合的道路。1959年矿山的部分领导人员贪大求“洋”，强调条件差，没有积极自力更生地进行技术革命，单纯等待用“洋机器”来改造矿山，由于洋设备的订货和制造需要相当长的时间，需要大批的原材料，因此，去年一年的技术改造，虽然取得了一定的成就，但效果不很显著。到去年年底，全矿二千多职工，矿石的日产量还不到一千吨，矿石的日运量不到四百吨。
    这个矿山的党委总结了去年的经验教训以后，一致认为，要多快好省地进行改造，必须坚决贯彻执行党的方针政策：依靠群众，自力更生。要自力更生，就必须实事求是地从矿山现有条件出发，因陋就简，因地制宜地进行技术改造，用土办法实现机械化和半机械化。矿党委发动群众，掀起了以大搞机械化、半机械化为中心的技术革命和技术改造群众运动，因陋就简地建立了竹索厂和机修、木器车间。他们首先针对矿山山高路险、运输不便的特点，把突击改造矿山运输作为主攻方向，狠抓索道的建设和运输工具的改革。没有钢轨，他们就利用山上的木料做木轨；没有钢丝绳，就用竹索代替；没有动力，就充分利用地形的自然坡度和水力。仅仅经过两个月，就架设了竹索道三十四条共七千多米，修建木轨道、绞车道、土溜槽和简易公路一万一千多米，制造各种车辆二百九十多辆。全矿的运输实现了索道化、木轨化、车子化、溜槽化、绞车化，消灭了人背肩挑的笨重体力劳动，运输工人由七百多人减少到四百多人，矿石的日运量由三百多吨迅速提高到了一千四百多吨。运输效率的提高，又大大促进了矿石产量的增长。
    这个矿山在初步实现土机械化生产以后，矿党委紧接着提出，过去靠“土办法”起家，现在要“土办法”发展，要在“土”的基础上逐步提高。党委发动群众对已有的各种土机具、土设备进行鉴定，落后的淘汰，先进的保留，并继续加以巩固提高，组织群众大搞“土办法”的生产自动化、联动化、运输双轨化、列车化。结果，使原来的技术革新项目更加完善，效率更加提高。如在掘进和采矿方面出现了撞竿二锤、自动掌钎、万能打眼机、连环炮等效率较高的先进机具。索道运输方面，也由单线索道发展到多线索道、下山索道发展到翻山索道，人工装卸、刹车发展到自动装卸、刹车，并创造了一些自动化水平较高的新工具，大大提高了矿山的机械化水平。
    李家山铁矿从今年年初起，党委就把90％以上的干部组织到生产第一线，坚持“四同”，领导技术改造工作，因此使这个矿的技术改造获得了优异成就。
