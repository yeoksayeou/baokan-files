　　Welcome Bookstores to Rent Books
　　Jian Shao
    Recently, some bookstores in Wuhan have set up book rental departments, renting out classic works, reference materials to support various movements, and excellent literary works, etc. This practice has many benefits and is deeply welcomed and praised by the majority of readers.
    Since the Great Leap Forward, people have needed more spiritual food. Many books have been published in first, second, and third editions... and have been bought up, but they are still in short supply. Renting books allows readers to read books that are temporarily unavailable for purchase or that cannot be reprinted in time, satisfying readers' work and study needs. At the same time, this practice is also in line with the spirit of frugality. A book costing more than one yuan can be borrowed for a week for a rental fee of only four or five cents. If it is not finished, it can be renewed. Of course, it is convenient to have a copy of some books that need to be read repeatedly, but some books only need to be browsed once or twice, or some passages need to be selected and read. This not only reduces the burden on readers, but also allows some books not to be reprinted or reprinted less, saving paper.
    In recent years, bookstores have done more and better work to serve readers. Recommending new and good books, delivering books to homes, ordering by mail from distant places, and even some bookstores helping readers to copy books that are out of stock. Now, they are renting books. This communist style of leaving convenience to others and leaving difficulties to themselves, and the spirit of enthusiastically serving readers, is worthy of promotion and learning.

　　欢迎书店出租图书
　　剑韶
    最近，武汉市一些书店设立了图书出租部，出租的图书有经典著作，有配合各种运动的参考资料，还有优秀的文艺作品等，这种作法好处很多，深受广大读者的欢迎和赞扬。
    大跃进以来，人们需要更多精神粮食，许多图书出了一版、二版、三版……，都被购买一空，仍然供不应求。出租图书，可以使读者能读到一时还购买不到的或来不及再版的书籍，使读者满足了工作和学习的需要。同时，这种作法还符合节约的精神。一本一块多钱的书，只需租金四、五分钱便可以借阅一个星期，如果阅读不完还可续借；有些需要反复阅读的书籍，手头上有一本当然方便，但有些书籍只需浏览一、二遍或选读其中某些段落就够了。这样作，既减轻了读者的负担，又可以使一些书籍不翻印或少翻印，节约了纸张。
    近年来，书店为读者服务的工作做得更多更好了。推荐新书好书，送书上门，远途函购，甚至有些书店帮助读者抄写缺售的书籍，现在又出租图书，这种把方便留给别人，把困难留给自己的共产主义风格，热心为读者服务的精神，是值得提倡和学习的。
