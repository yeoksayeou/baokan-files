    Priest and Executioner
    Article by Lu Fuwei, drawing by Fang Cheng
    An executioner acting as a nanny, a swindler as a teacher—how utterly astonishing! The United Nations Secretary-General Hammarskjöld said to the people of the Congo: "In the difficult initial steps, we will be happy to accompany you hand-in-hand. After a few steps, you will walk alone..." He played the role of a swindler, finishing his flowery opening remarks, and then began to perform...
    The Congo is full of disasters. In the past, black people were merely "black ivory." Colonizers priced them according to their height and weight, branding them with red-hot irons for sale! How many tears and how much blood has flowed into the Congo River since then! It sobbed, roared, and stirred up a giant wave of resistance, finally winning today's independence. But the Belgian aggressor troops came, the United Nations sent troops... Imperialism will never give up, using excuses such as the Congolese people being "not yet mature" and "lacking spiritual preparation for independence" to extend its claws of intervention and strangulation. Lenin said: "All oppressing classes need two social functions to maintain their rule: the function of the executioner and the function of the priest." Thus, the American imperialists and the United Nations Under-Secretary-General Bunche came to the Congo to play the "nanny" of "independence"!
    However, all reactionaries can never escape this contradiction: the hypocritical words they painstakingly decorate are inevitably punctured by their own shameless actions. Under the cover of the United Nations olive flag, the colonizers engage in sinful deeds: they blatantly disarm Congolese soldiers; they secretly allow Belgian aggressor troops to change into United Nations uniforms; they instruct their lackeys to engage in separatist activities... Enough, enough! The United Nations historical archives, already stained with the blood of the Korean people, are adding many new pieces of evidence! The murderous dagger is revealed, and U.S. Vice President Nixon gleefully trumpets that once the situation "calms down," an "African Development Committee" will be established. So that's it!
    In the Congo, imperialism has once again acted as the best teacher by negative example: it has taught the people of the whole world that they must abandon illusions and actively struggle! It has made the naive people of the past become clear-headed, and made the clear-headed people even more determined! Congolese soldiers refuse to hand over their weapons, refuse to be "repatriated" and go home. Ignoring the suppression and obstruction of the "UN forces," they continue to arrest colonial criminals and continue to eliminate separatist elements lying in the embrace of imperialism. What American aircraft "Globemaster," what "the United Nations has the right to fire first," they don't care about any of it! The Congolese people are using armed struggle to break free from the shackles of colonialism and realize their desire for an independent and unified motherland. In the face of the anti-imperialist wave, under the roar of protest, the American "colonial problem expert" Bunche was forced to roll out of the Congo. He lamented: I didn't expect the Congo to be such a place where "misunderstandings" easily occur!
    For people like Bunche, there are many more things they did not expect! They did not expect that in the face of resolutely struggling colonial people, priests and executioners are of no use at all. They did not expect that the Congo is not only a treasure land, but also a powder keg filled with hatred against imperialism, and the aggressor troops just played the role of a match. This fire is burning towards the entire continent that longs for independence, incinerating the dying colonial system. Now, the morning star has risen in the sky above the dark continent. Is the bright dawn still far away? Wake up!
  You, for now, in dreams can hear,
  Oh, the enslaved woman sleeping!
  The voice of progress,
  Now resounding throughout the world;
  "Oh, Africa,
  The time has come!
  Arise, take action!"
  —Excerpt from the poem "Arise, Take Action!" by African poet Luís de Noronha (Mozambique) (with picture)

    神甫兼刽子手
    陆拂为文　方成画
    刽子手充保姆，骗子手当教员，令人万分诧异。联合国秘书长哈马舍尔德对刚果人民说：“在走头几步的困难时期，我们将很高兴地手携手地陪同你们，在走了几步以后，你们将单独走了……”他扮演骗子脚色，用花腔唱完开场白，接着就表演……
    刚果是多灾多难。过去，黑人不过是“黑色的象牙”，殖民者按他们的身长、体重分等标价，用烧红的烙铁剜上印记出卖！从那时起，刚果河里流下多少眼泪和鲜血！它呜咽、咆哮，掀起反抗的巨浪，终于赢得今日的独立。但是，比利时侵略军来了，联合国出兵了……帝国主义永远不会死心，在刚果人民“还未成熟”、“对独立缺乏精神准备”等借口下，伸出干涉、扼杀的魔爪。列宁说过：“所有一切压迫阶级，为了维持自己的统治，都需要有两种社会职能：一种是刽子手的职能，一种是神甫的职能。”于是，美帝国主义者、联合国副秘书长本奇，就来刚果扮演“独立”的“保姆”！
    但是，一切反动派永远摆脱不了这样的矛盾：他们费心修饰起来的伪善言辞不可避免地被自己无耻的行径戳穿。在联合国橄榄旗的掩护下，殖民者进行罪恶的勾当：他们明目张胆地解除刚果士兵的武装；他们偷偷摸摸地让比利时侵略军换上联合国的军服；他们指使走狗大搞分裂活动，……够了，够了，浸满朝鲜人民鲜血的联合国历史档案袋里，又添进许多新的罪证！图穹匕首现，美国副总统尼克松得意洋洋鼓吹：一俟局势“平静”，将成立“非洲发展委员会”，原来如此！
    帝国主义在刚果，再一次充当了最好的反面教员：它教会全世界人民必须抛弃幻想，积极斗争！它使过去天真的人变得清醒，使清醒的人更为坚定！刚果士兵拒绝交出武器，拒绝被“遣返”和回家。他们不顾“联合国军”的镇压和阻拦，继续逮捕殖民罪犯，继续扫荡躺在帝国主义怀抱里的分裂主义分子。什么美国飞机“环球霸王号”，什么“联合国有权首先开枪”，一概不在他们眼里！刚果人民正用武装斗争挣脱殖民主义的枷锁，实现独立、统一祖国的愿望。在反帝的浪潮前，在抗议的吼声下，美国“殖民问题专家”本奇被迫滚出刚果，他哀叹道：没有想到，刚果竟是这样一个容易发生“误会”的地方！
    对于本奇之流来说，没有想到的事情还多得很呢！他们没有想到：在坚决斗争的殖民地人民面前，神甫和刽子手是一概不中用的。他们没有想到：刚果不仅是一块宝地，还是一个充满反对帝国主义仇恨的火药库，侵略军刚好起了火柴的作用。这把火烧向整个渴望独立的大陆，焚毁着垂朽的殖民主义体系。现在，黑暗大陆的上空已升起晓星，光明的曙天还会远吗？ 醒醒吧！
  你且在梦里听一听，
  呵，沉睡的女奴隶呀！
  进步的声音，
  如今响澈了整个世界；
  “呵，阿非利加，
  是时候了！
  起来，行动吧！”
  ——摘自非洲诗人路易·德·诺罗尼亚（莫三鼻给）的诗《起来，行动吧！》（附图片）
