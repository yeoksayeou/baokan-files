Masses in Cotton Areas Vigorously Develop Grain Production to Promote Early Maturation of Cotton and Free Up Land for Wheat Planting

Bufeng Commune Rationally Arranges Crop Rotation to Strive for Higher Cotton Yields and Ensure Early Wheat Sowing

This newspaper's Yancheng dispatch on the 22nd: The Bufeng Commune in Yancheng County, Jiangsu Province, has adopted various measures to promote the early maturation and boll opening of cotton, ensuring high cotton yields and timely early sowing of wheat.

The Bufeng Commune is an old cotton-growing area, with a total of 75,000 mu planted with cotton this year. The commune members have already begun happily picking new cotton. In order to implement the Party's call to "vigorously develop agriculture and vigorously develop grain production," the commune decided to plant wheat, rapeseed, and green manure extensively in the cotton fields, expanding the double-cropping area. However, this year, due to the good late-stage management of cotton, it is growing vigorously, with many autumn and late-autumn bolls at the top of the plants. Therefore, a new contradiction has emerged between striving for higher cotton yields and timely early autumn sowing. After investigation and sorting, the Commune Party Committee found that more than 50,000 mu of first-class seedlings in the commune had five or six late-autumn bolls at the top of each cotton plant. These late-autumn bolls generally do not open until more than ten days after "Frost's Descent." If the cotton stalks are pulled out early, each plant will lose at least four or five bolls. The 20,000 mu of second-class seedlings generally have four or five middle and late-autumn bolls at the top, which will open six or seven days after "Frost's Descent." If the cotton stalks are pulled out early, each plant will lose two or three bolls. The 3,400 mu of third-class seedlings have fewer late-autumn bolls and can be pulled and cultivated a few days before "Frost's Descent." According to the local temperature conditions, the sowing period for three wheat crops is most suitable ten days before "Frost's Descent."

After carefully analyzing the above situation, the Bufeng Commune Party Committee mobilized cadres and commune members to summarize the experience of intercropping three wheat crops in some cotton fields last year and adopted a series of measures to effectively resolve the contradiction between timely early autumn sowing and striving for higher cotton yields.

Comprehensively promoting the early maturation and boll opening of cotton is one of the important methods to strive for high cotton yields and ensure timely sowing of three wheat crops. Their specific methods are: First, universally apply phosphate fertilizer frequently and manage diligently to ensure early maturation and flowering of cotton bolls. The Commune Party Committee has changed the original pest control teams into phosphate spraying teams, treating pests when they exist and spraying phosphate when they don't. Recently, the entire commune mobilized more than 3,000 people and more than 1,800 sprayers, launching a five-day blitz to spray phosphate on all 70,000 mu of cotton fields once. Second, for a small number of third-class seedlings, use foliar fertilization to promote early development and maturation of young bolls. Third, continue to adopt the five-pronged approach of topping, removing old leaves, pruning branches, removing excess buds, and removing ineffective flower buds to concentrate nutrients and create conditions for early maturation and boll opening of cotton. Fourth, continue to lower the groundwater level. Recently, the entire commune organized more than 10,000 laborers to clean all the ditches in the cotton fields and pump out the accumulated water from more than 4,000 mu of fields. Due to the above measures, it is estimated that more than 7,000 mu of cotton fields in the entire commune can have their stalks pulled and cultivated before "Frost's Descent."

The commune also has more than 67,000 mu of cotton with good growth and many autumn bolls at the top, which cannot be pulled and cultivated around "Frost's Descent" even with strengthened late-stage management. Therefore, this part of the cotton field all needs to be intercropped. After comprehensive arrangements by the Commune Party Committee, the labor-intensive tasks of transporting fertilizer, applying fertilizer, and plowing the land are all being done in advance. As early as last month, the production teams launched a mass movement of accumulating and making fertilizer in the fields. Over the past month, the accumulated fertilizer has basically met the needs of autumn sowing. In order to facilitate timely intercropping, the commune organized more than 6,000 laborers to form deep plowing teams to carry out manual deep digging in the cotton fields. At the same time, the entire commune also organized more than 1,200 people to send fertilizer to the fields, fertilizing while deep digging, fertilizing first, and then deep digging. The entire commune plans to deep plow all cotton fields by the 25th of this month.

Each professional team has correspondingly established a "five-fixed" responsibility system of fixed personnel, fixed fields, fixed time, fixed standards, and fixed work points, to achieve "shovel-to-shovel connection, consistent depth, plowing without damaging bolls, and digging without empty shovels."

　　棉区群众大办粮食　促棉早熟腾地种麦
    步凤公社合理安排茬口既争棉花多收又保小麦早播
    本报盐城22日电　江苏省盐城县步凤公社采取多种措施，促使棉桃早成熟，早吐絮，保证棉花高产多收和麦子适时早播。
    步凤公社是个老棉区，今年共种植棉花七万五千亩，社员们已开始喜拾新花。公社为了贯彻党的“大办农业，大办粮食”的号召，决定在棉田大种小麦、油菜和绿肥，扩大两熟面积。但是，今年由于棉花后期管理得好，长势旺盛，顶部秋桃和晚秋桃多，因此出现了力争多产棉花与适时提早秋播的新矛盾。公社党委经过调查排队，全公社五万多亩一类苗，棉株顶部都有五、六个晚秋桃。这些晚秋桃一般要到“霜降”后十多天才吐絮，如果早拔花秸，每株至少要损失四、五个桃子。二万多亩二类苗，一般顶部有四、五个中、晚秋桃，到“霜降”后六、七天才能吐絮。要是早拔花秸，每棵也要损失两三个桃子。三千四百亩三类苗，晚秋桃子较少，“霜降”前几天可以拔秸耕种。根据本地的气温条件，三麦的播种期又最适宜在“霜降”前十天。
    步凤公社党委在认真分析了上述情况以后，发动干部社员总结了去年部分棉田套作三麦的经验，采取了一系列措施，有效地解决了适时提早秋播与力争多收棉花的矛盾。
    全面促进棉桃早成熟，早吐絮，是力争棉花高产多收，保证三麦适时播种重要方法之一。他们的具体办法是：第一，普遍做到勤喷磷肥，勤管理，保证棉桃早成熟，早开花。公社党委已将原有的治虫专业队改为喷磷专业队，有虫治虫，无虫喷磷。最近全公社又出动三千多人，一千八百多架喷雾器，突击五天，七万多亩棉田已全部喷磷一次。第二，对于少数三类苗，用根外施肥法促使幼桃早发育，早成熟。第三，继续采取摘边心，打老叶，剪公枝，抹赘芽，去无效花蕾的五管齐下办法，集中养分，为棉桃早成熟，早吐絮创造条件。第四，继续降低地下水位。最近全公社组织一万多个劳力，把棉田水沟都清理了一遍，车干四千多亩田的积水。由于采取以上措施，预计全公社有七千多亩棉田可在“霜降”前拔秸耕种。
    这个公社还有六万七千多亩棉花，长势好，顶部秋桃多，即使加强后期管理，也不能在“霜降”前后拔秸耕种。因此这一部分棉田，全都需要套种。公社党委经过全面安排，把费工较大的运肥，施肥，耕翻土地等农活都提前来做。早在上月份，各生产队就开展了群众性的田头积肥、造肥运动。一个多月来，积肥已基本上满足了秋播的需要。为了适时套种，公社组织六千多个劳力，组成了深翻专业队，在棉田里进行人工深挖。同时，全社还组织一千二百多人送肥下田，做到边施肥，边深挖，先施肥，后深挖。全社计划在本月25日前将所有棉田都深翻一遍。
    各个专业队都相应地建立了定人，定田，定时间，定标准，定工分的
  “五定”责任制，做到“锹锹相接，深度一致，耕翻不损桃，挖地不空锹”。
