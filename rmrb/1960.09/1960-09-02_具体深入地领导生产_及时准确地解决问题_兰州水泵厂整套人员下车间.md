    Leading Production Concretely and Deeply, Solving Problems Promptly and Accurately
    Lanzhou Water Pump Factory Sends Complete Teams of Personnel to Workshops

    (Our report) The Lanzhou Water Pump Factory has adopted the method of "complete cadre deployment" to go down to the workshops, comprehensively promoting the sustained leap forward in production.

    "Complete cadre deployment" means that among the cadres going deep into the front line of production, a secretary or member of the Party General Branch takes the lead, and is equipped with a complete set of personnel including political, business, and technical cadres to go down to the workshop to comprehensively grasp political, business, and technical work, and to carry it through to the end. The implementation of this method makes leading production more concrete and in-depth, and solving problems more timely and accurate. At present, the factory has a total of four teams of cadres, going deep into three production workshops and the living welfare department respectively.

    When carrying out complete cadre deployment, the Lanzhou Water Pump Factory first forms complete teams of cadres with different focuses according to the specific problems and weak links existing in each workshop, so as to combine cadre deployment with solving the weak links in each workshop. The machining workshop is the last process of the entire factory, and products can leave the factory after passing through this workshop. However, the production management of this workshop is relatively chaotic, and the connection of processes is not tight, which directly affects the assembly and delivery of major products. Therefore, this team of cadres included the head of the production planning section and others. At present, with the help of the cadres who have gone down to the workshop, this workshop has revised several management systems, making management work gradually on the right track.

    When carrying out complete cadre deployment, the Lanzhou Water Pump Factory also matches cadres according to the central production tasks and according to the cadres' own business and expertise, so as to combine cadre deployment with the central production tasks. The regenerative furnace in the sand casting workshop needed major repairs, and the newly trial-produced regenerative furnace was not very effective, and turning white cast iron into gray cast iron was a major key. Therefore, the team of cadres sent to this workshop included the deputy director of the factory who came from the sand casting workshop and the technician from the production technology section. By working alongside the workers, re-formulating the proportion of materials, and strictly implementing the process regulations, the problem of white-to-gray transformation was solved in time. Another batch of urgently needed drought-resistant products, cast iron pipes, produced in this workshop, could only produce more than 20 pipes a day due to technical problems. After Deputy Director Zhu Peiyi and other cadres went to the workshop, they worked with the workshop leaders, workers, and technicians to jointly study and make decisions, which rapidly increased production. At present, more than 40 pipes can be produced a day, more than double the previous amount.

    After the Lanzhou Water Pump Factory implemented complete cadre deployment to the workshops, it closely combined politics, business, and technology, and promptly solved key production problems, thus powerfully promoting the comprehensive leap forward in production. As of the end of July, the output of the factory's main products had completed the annual plan five months ahead of schedule, exceeding it by 3.3%. Other indicators such as cost, labor productivity, and profit delivery have also completed the plan.

### 具体深入地领导生产　及时准确地解决问题  兰州水泵厂整套人员下车间

    具体深入地领导生产　及时准确地解决问题
    兰州水泵厂整套人员下车间
    本报讯　兰州水泵厂采用“干部配套”下车间的办法，全面促进了生产的持续跃进。
      “干部配套”，即在深入生产第一线的干部中，由一名书记或党总支委员挂帅，另外配备包括政治、业务、技术等干部在内的一整套人员下到车间去，把政治、业务、技术等工作全面地抓起来，并且一抓到底。实行这种办法后，使领导生产更具体、深入，解决问题更及时、准确。目前，全厂共有四套干部，分别深入到三个生产车间和生活福利部门。
    兰州水泵厂在进行干部配套的时候，首先根据各车间存在的具体问题和薄弱环节，组成有不同重点的整套干部，使干部配套和解决各车间薄弱环节结合起来。加工车间是全厂的最后一道工序，产品经过这个车间就可以出厂。但是，这个车间的生产管理工作比较乱，工序衔接不紧密，直接影响着主要产品的装配出厂。所以在这一套干部中，就包括了生产计划科长等人。目前，这个车间在下到车间的干部帮助下，已经修订了好几种管理制度，使管理工作逐渐走上了正轨。
    兰州水泵厂在进行干部配套时，还根据生产中心任务，根据干部的本身业务和专长进行搭配，使干部配套和生产中心任务相结合。翻砂车间的再生炉要大修，而新试制的再生炉还不大好使，白口铁变灰口铁是一个大关键。于是，在下到这个车间的一套干部中，就包括了翻砂工出身的副厂长和生产技术科的技师。通过跟班劳动，重新制定下料比料，严格工艺规程，白变灰的问题及时解决了。这个车间另外生产的一批抗旱急需产品——铸铁管，由于技术上没过关，一天只能生产二十多根，副厂长朱沛意同志和其他干部到车间后，和车间领导、工人、技术人员一起，共同研究，一道决策，使生产迅速提高，目前，一天可生产四十余根，比过去提高一倍。
    兰州水泵厂实行干部配套下车间后，使政治、业务、技术紧密结合，及时解决生产关键问题，因而有力地推动了生产全面大跃进。截至7月底，这个厂的主要产品产量已经提前五个月、超额3.3％完成了全年计划，其他成本、劳动生产率、上交利润等项指标也都完成了计划。
