Xinhua News Agency, Nanchang Telegram: The Changxi Brigade of Shiqiao Commune, Yongxin County, Jiangxi Province, is inspecting the growth of rice seedlings acre by acre, formulating late-stage cultivation measures plot by plot, and implementing late-stage management responsibilities field by field, launching a vigorous and down-to-earth large-scale autumn field management competition.

Currently, groups of brigade members are vigorously cultivating fields to remove weeds, and diligently transporting and applying fertilizer. All four teams, twenty-one work groups, and more than two hundred members of the brigade have joined the competition. Many fathers and sons, brothers, couples, and mothers-in-law and daughters-in-law are also engaging in head-to-head competitions. During the competition, the attendance rate of the entire brigade reaches 99% every day, and labor efficiency has increased by 25% compared to the past. Driven by the competition, autumn field management is becoming more meticulous, and the seedlings are growing better and better. After field-by-field inspection of the brigade's 723 mu of late rice, the proportion of first-class seedlings has risen from 50% of the total area in the early stage to 85%, and there are basically no third-class seedlings left.

After the completion of three cultivations and three topdressings, ending the early-stage field management, the Changxi Brigade launched a large-scale autumn field management inspection on August 20. The brigade organized a general inspection team, led by the Party branch secretary, to inspect representative fields in each team. Each team organized inspection subgroups, led by the team leader, to inspect the seedlings row by row and acre by acre. Through on-site inspections and interviews with brigade members, it was found that most of the seedlings in the brigade were growing well, with first-class seedlings accounting for 50%, second-class seedlings accounting for 45%, and third-class seedlings accounting for only 5%. In particular, it was discovered from the inspection that as long as late-stage cultivation management is further strengthened, first-class seedlings can be further improved to strive for more grain; second-class seedlings can be rapidly improved to catch up with first-class seedlings; and third-class seedlings can change their appearance. Based on these findings, the brigade Party branch immediately mobilized brigade members to discuss how to strengthen late-stage field management in a more detailed and better way. Subsequently, the growth of seedlings was inspected acre by acre, cultivation measures were formulated plot by plot, and management responsibilities were assigned to each group, each person, and each field. In order to further encourage the enthusiasm of the brigade members, the Party branch also promptly convened a brigade-wide meeting to mobilize everyone to launch a competition. At the same time, the responsible cadres of the brigade were assigned to lead the work of each team. In this way, a vigorous large-scale autumn field management competition was quickly launched throughout the brigade.

Making first-class seedlings even better, second-class seedlings quickly catch up with first-class seedlings, and third-class seedlings rapidly rise to first-class or second-class seedlings, is the main content of the Changxi Brigade's large-scale autumn field management competition. In the competition, brigade members first focused on better cultivating and managing the first and second-class seedlings, which account for 95% of the total area. The central measures for cultivating first-class seedlings in each team are to apply one topdressing of manure ash to prevent the seedlings from turning yellow; to properly drain the fields and expose the soil to the sun; and to knock off the water droplets on the rice leaves in the early morning to prevent the seedlings from lodging. The central measures for cultivating second-class seedlings are to cultivate the fields once to remove all weeds; and to apply two topdressings of fertilizer to promote the rapid growth of seedlings into first-class seedlings.

The management measures for third-class seedlings mainly include removing all weeds in the field, cultivating the fields twice, and applying three topdressings of fertilizer.

In order to ensure that the responsibility for implementing the measures is assigned to individuals, each team assigns fields and rows to work groups, and each group assigns fields to individuals, implementing a management responsibility system of fixed fields, fixed people, fixed time, fixed quality, fixed work points, and fixed rewards and punishments. On this basis, competitions are organized. The Second Team, with a total of 174 mu of first-class and second-class seedlings, concentrated 90% of its labor force to be responsible for management. The team cadres divided these laborers into four groups, and the groups and members competed fiercely with each other. The First Group initially cultivated one mu of fields per person per day, leading the entire brigade; then the members of the Second Group worked hard to catch up, reaching 1.2 mu of fields cultivated per person per day, surpassing the First Group; soon, the Fourth Group surpassed the Second Group again, cultivating 1.3 mu of fields per person per day. As a result, this team achieved an average of 1.5 mu of fields cultivated per person per day, completing the third cultivation task for the second-class seedlings three days ahead of schedule, and the quality was very good, with every field cultivated smoothly and thoroughly. The four teams and brigade members competed with each other to implement fertilization measures well and raced to eliminate third-class seedlings quickly. After the brigade members responsible for eliminating third-class seedlings in the Third Team challenged the Second Team, the old farmer Zhou Juxiu, Gao Mingli, and seven young brigade members immediately carried their luggage and tools, built straw sheds next to the third-class seedling fields, fought day and night in the fields, topdressing fertilizer and cultivating, and stayed overnight next to the fields to protect the seedlings. Brigade members from other teams also quickly followed their example. Each team accumulated the best fertilizer and applied it to the fields, using skillful techniques to cultivate and weed, so that the third-class seedlings were quickly upgraded. The entire brigade spent only ten days topdressing fertilizer and cultivating once for most of the first and second-class seedlings, four days ahead of schedule. Of the entire brigade's 36 mu of third-class seedlings, 25 mu have now grown into first-class or second-class seedlings.

    长溪大队逐亩加强晚稻后期管理
    全队开展秋田管理大竞赛，劳动工效提高百分之二十五，基本上消灭了三类苗
  新华社南昌电　江西永新县石桥公社长溪大队一亩亩检查禾苗生长情况，一块块制定后期培育措施，一丘丘落实后期管理责任，掀起了轰轰烈烈、扎扎实实的秋田后期管理大竞赛。
    目前，这个大队的社员们一组组、一群群，有的加劲耘田除草，有的努力运肥、追肥。全大队的四个小队、二十一个作业小组、二百多个社员都投入了竞赛，有许多父子、兄弟、夫妻、婆媳之间，还开展了对手赛。在竞赛中，全队出勤率每天达到99％，劳动工效比过去提高了25％。在竞赛的推动下，秋田管理越管越细，禾苗愈长愈好。全队七百二十三亩晚稻，经过逐丘检验，一类禾已由前期占总面积的50％上升到85％，已基本没有三类禾。
    经过三耘三追肥，结束了前期田间管理后，长溪大队于8月20日开展了秋田管理大检查。大队组织检查总团，由党支部书记率领巡回到各小队重点检查有代表性的田，各小队组织检查分团，由小队长率领逐垅逐亩检查禾苗。通过实地查看和访问社员，发现全大队的禾苗大部分生长很好，一类禾占50％，二类禾占45％，三类禾只占5％。特别是从检查中发现，只要进一步加强后期培育管理，一类禾可以锦上添花，争取多收一些粮食；二类禾可以迅速提高，赶上一类禾；三类禾可以改变面貌。根据检查发现的这些情况，大队党支部立即在全队发动社员讨论如何更细更好地加强后期田间管理。接着，逐亩检查禾苗生长情况，逐块制定了培育措施，逐组逐人逐丘落实了管理责任。党支部为了进一步鼓舞社员的干劲，又及时召开了全队社员大会，发动大家开展竞赛。同时，大队的负责干部分工领导各个小队的工作。这样，轰轰烈烈的秋田后期管理大竞赛便在全队迅速展开了。
    使一类禾锦上添花、二类禾迅速赶上一类禾、三类禾迅速上升为一类禾或二类禾，是长溪大队秋田后期管理大竞赛的主要内容。社员们在竞赛中首先更好地培育管理占总面积95％的一、二类禾。各队培育一类禾的中心措施是
  追一次灶肥，以防止禾苗转黄；适时放水晒
  田，清晨打掉禾叶上的水珠，以防止禾苗倒伏。培育二类禾的中心措施是耘一次田，除净草；追二次肥，以促使禾苗迅速长成一类禾。
    对三类禾的管理措施主要是除光拔净田间一切杂草，耘两次田，追三次肥。
    为了使执行措施的责任落实到人，各小队按作业小组包田垅，各小组内又分人包丘，实行了定丘、定人、定时、定质量、定工分、定奖惩的管理责任制。在此基础上组织开展竞赛。第二小队，共有一百七十四亩一类禾和二类禾，集中了90％的劳力负责管理。小队干部将这些劳力分别组成四个小组，小组与小组、社员与社员之间大闹竞赛。第一小组开始每人每天耘田一亩，在全队领先；接着第二小组社员奋力追赶，达到每人每天耘田一亩二分，超过了第一小组；不久，第四小组又超过了第二小组，每人每日耘田一亩三分。结果这个小队达到了每人每日平均耘田一亩五分，全队提前三天完成了二类禾的第三次耘田任务，并且质量很好，丘丘都达到了耘得泥平、泥烂。大队的四个小队和社员之间，互相比执行培肥措施好、赛消灭三类禾快。第三小队包干消灭三类禾的社员向第二小队发起挑战后，老农周菊修、高明理和七个青年社员立即背着行季、带着工具，到三类禾田旁搭起草棚，日战田间，追肥耘田，夜宿田旁，护育禾苗。其他小队的社员也按照他们的榜样，迅速跟了上来。各小队积造了最好的肥料追到田里，用精巧的技术耘田除草，使三类禾迅速升级。全队只用十天时间就把大部分一、二类禾苗追了一次肥，耘了一次田，比原计划提早了四天。全大队的三十六亩三类禾，现在已有二十五亩长成了一类禾或二类禾。
