Xinhua News Agency, 4th: Nine mining bureaus recently proposed launching a socialist competition with coal miners nationwide to ensure the increased production of more and better coal to support the continued leap forward in steel and various sectors of the national economy. These proposals have now been forwarded by the Ministry of Coal Industry and the National Committee of the China Coal Miners' Union to all coal mines across the country, along with a call for all coal miners to enthusiastically respond to these proposals and strive to increase coal production significantly.

The nine mining bureaus that put forward the proposal are Fushun and Fuxin in Liaoning Province; Kailuan and Jingxing in Hebei Province; Huainan in Anhui Province; Pingdingshan and Hebi in Henan Province; Zibo in Shandong Province; and Jingxi in Beijing.

These nine mining bureaus have achieved significant accomplishments in the first eight months of this year, with substantial increases in coal production compared to the same period last year. Recently, workers from these mining bureaus comprehensively summarized the achievements and experiences of the continuous leap forward in the first eight months, deeply discussed and formulated plans and guarantee measures for increasing production and practicing economy in the next four months, and then put forward a proposal to coal miners nationwide to carry out a socialist competition.

In their proposal, the workers from these nine mining bureaus unanimously expressed their determination to fully complete and overfulfill the state plan. In addition to increasing production, they also aim to further improve coal quality, accelerate tunneling work, conserve pit props, and speed up coal transportation. For example, in terms of improving coal quality, workers from the Jingxi Mining Bureau guaranteed that the sulfur content of all coal sold externally would not exceed 1% in the next four months. Workers from the Zibo Mining Bureau also guaranteed that the ash content and sulfur content of coal would be reduced by 8.26% and nearly half, respectively, compared to the state plan. In terms of accelerating tunneling, workers from the Hebi Mining Bureau guaranteed to further apply the experience of rapid tunneling, striving to increase the average monthly footage from September to December by 53.8% compared to the previous eight months, achieving a recoverable coal volume period of more than seven months. Workers from the Kailuan Coal Mine proposed vigorously promoting the experience of the Ren Guangjin and Li Changliang rapid tunneling teams, guaranteeing that the daily tunneling progress in the entire mining area would reach more than 2,400 meters, and striving to add ten additional mining faces by the end of the year, maintaining a recoverable coal volume of more than five and a half months regularly. Workers from the Jingxing Mining Bureau guaranteed that they would overfulfill the plan for roadway development and total tunneling footage this year, which would not only guarantee the need for increased coal production in the next four months, but also prepare sufficient reserve working faces for production next year. In terms of conserving pit prop consumption, the targets proposed by workers from Pingdingshan, Zibo, Hebi and other mining bureaus were all more than 10% lower than the state plan. In terms of accelerating coal transportation, workers from the Fushun Mining Bureau proposed that starting from September, the amount of coal transported daily would increase from more than 800 cars in August to more than 900 cars. Workers from the Huainan Mining Bureau guaranteed that the one-time operation time of freight cars in the mining area would be reduced from the current 1.37 hours to 1.24 hours.

In order to guarantee the realization of the above competition conditions, workers from these nine mines also put forward specific measures in their proposal. They unanimously expressed their determination to continue to adhere to the principle of putting politics in command, vigorously promote mass movements, further deepen and broadly discuss and formulate plans and guarantee measures for increasing production and practicing economy, and on this basis, deeply carry out the large-scale high-yield red flag competition movement centered on technical innovation and technical revolution. Technical innovation projects that emerged in the previous period will be sorted out and appraised under the leadership of the Party committee, using the method of combining leading cadres, workers, and technical personnel. Those innovation projects that have the greatest effect and universal significance will be summarized, improved, and widely promoted to rapidly increase working face output, increase tunneling speed, and improve mine production capacity. At the same time, the transformation of coal bunkers and lines will be accelerated so that transportation capacity can adapt to the needs of continuous leap forward in production. In the guarantee measures they proposed, the workers of each mine also particularly emphasized the need to improve leadership style and working methods and improve enterprise management. For example, the Huainan Mining Bureau decided to send 70% of its cadres to the production site to eat, live, work, and discuss with the workers, and earnestly focus on the work of the team, and establish and improve the underground office system. Kailuan Coal Mine is also preparing to establish a three-level, three-shift leadership duty system at the bureau, mine, and district levels. At the same time, it will promote the "one, two, three" (one day of study, two days of meetings and office work, and three days of labor) leadership method among all leading cadres in order to further strengthen leadership on the production front line.

In addition to this, the various proposals also put forward specific measures on how to further implement the policy of combining work and rest and ensuring safe production, and comprehensively arranging the lives of workers after carrying out the increase production and practice economy movement.

Xinhua News Agency, 4th: The Ministry of Coal Industry and the National Coal Miners' Union today sent a letter to the workers of the national coal industry. The letter stated that the entire staff of the nine mining bureaus of Jingxi, Kailuan, Jingxing, Fushun, Fuxin, Pingdingshan, Hebi, Huainan, and Zibo, in order to extensively and deeply carry out the increase production and practice economy movement, proposed a competition initiative to the workers of the national coal industry to overfulfill the 1960 production and construction tasks under the premise of safe production, combining work and rest, ensuring quality, improving efficiency, and reducing costs. The Ministry of Coal Industry and the National Coal Miners' Union believe that their initiative represents the common aspiration of millions of workers in the national coal industry. We call on all workers to enthusiastically respond to their initiative, muster greater revolutionary vigor, and promote the communist spirit of great cooperation of "learning, comparing, catching up, and helping," encouraging each other, leaping forward together, and rapidly throwing themselves into the increase production and practice economy movement centered on grain and steel, and striving to overfulfill this year's production and construction tasks.

The letter stated that in order to make the increase production and practice economy movement both vigorous and solid, we must conscientiously do the following work:

1.  Extensively and deeply mobilize the masses. From the actual situation of some enterprises and units recently carrying out the increase production and practice economy movement, mobilizing the masses should be from top to bottom, from within the Party to outside the Party, from workers to workers' families, comprehensively, layer by layer, and thoroughly, explaining the situation, assigning tasks, and outlining measures. Only by thoroughly explaining the current excellent situation, tasks, and measures to the workers can we clarify the direction for the vast number of workers, have a bottom line for tasks, and specify measures. Only in this way can we mobilize the enthusiasm of all parties and turn the increase production and practice economy movement into the conscious action of millions of people. On the basis of mobilizing the masses, each mine should launch a high tide of large-scale high-yield socialist labor competition through competition forms such as "counterpart competitions," "integrated competitions," "model worker selection," and "production sports meets." In the competition, we should focus on key production aspects, carry out technical innovation and technical revolution, and adopt methods such as "technical performances" and "advanced experience dissemination teams" to vigorously promote and consolidate effective advanced experiences, closely combining the spirit of hard work, practical work, and skillful work to maintain the abundant production enthusiasm of the workers.

2.  Focus on the grassroots and vigorously grasp production work at the team level. Doing a good job of the production team is an important part of carrying out the increase production and practice economy movement. Doing a good job of production team work is based on doing a good job of the team's political and ideological work and fully mobilizing the masses to discuss the national plan and formulate specific work plans for the team. Leading cadres and engineering technicians must go deep into the team, and together with the workers, adopt the method of great airing, great blooming, and great debate, and carry out specific analyses of the different characteristics of each mining face and tunneling face, find out the key to production, and formulate measures. In order to ensure that the production team realizes its work plan, it is necessary to strengthen the political and ideological leadership and organizational leadership of the team.

3.  Strengthen the organizational management of enterprises. We must strengthen the organizational allocation on the front line of production and improve organizational leadership. Equip sufficient and qualified cadres with both moral character and talent to adapt the grassroots organization to the production requirements. The allocation principle of district (section) chiefs should be based on the requirements of the four-shift work system, so that there is a district (section) chief on duty for each shift, and that the district (section) chief has one day off each week, and other staff in the district (section) should be equipped according to this principle, in order to establish a strict responsibility system, so that every shift is managed by someone, and every task is managed by someone, and to solve problems in production in a timely manner. It is necessary to improve and establish the rules and regulations necessary for production in a planned, step-by-step, and realistic manner, to strengthen the work of departments, and to improve the establishment of planning management, leadership cadre duty system, dispatching system, and underground office system. At the same time, we must resolutely implement the interim provisions on safe production promulgated by the Ministry to ensure safe production.

4.  Combine work and rest and care for the lives of workers. In the process of carrying out the increase production and practice economy movement, the more energetic the workers are, the more we should care about the lives of the workers, and truly grasp production with one hand and life with the other. Only in this way can the movement develop continuously and advance one wave higher than another. Enterprises and institutions should actively do a good job in the production of non-staple foods, mobilize workers and their families to grow more vegetables and fodder, raise pigs, sheep, and poultry in large quantities, and run public canteens well.

The letter concluded by saying that the current situation is very favorable for us to complete and overfulfill this year's production and construction tasks. We have the correct leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, and the foundation for continuous leap forward. The rainy season has passed, and the coal mine's production and construction work is in a "golden age." As long as we take advantage of this great time, seize the opportunity, muster our strength, advance victoriously, and carry out the increase production and practice economy movement extensively and deeply, we will certainly be able to complete and overfulfill this year's tasks and realize a continuous great leap forward in the coal industry.

    增产更多煤炭支援钢铁持续跃进
    九个矿务局深入讨论和制定计划，向各地煤矿职工倡议开展竞赛
    煤炭部和煤矿工会要求切实抓紧生产小组工作制定具体作业计划
    新华社4日讯　九个矿务局最近倡议同全国煤矿职工开展社会主义竞赛，保证增产更多更好的煤炭支援钢铁及国民经济各部门持续跃进的需要。现在，这些倡议书已经由煤炭工业部和中国煤矿工会全国委员会转发到全国各个煤矿，并且同时发出了号召，要求全国煤矿职工热烈响应这些倡议，为增产大量煤炭而奋斗。
    提出倡议的九个矿务局是辽宁的抚顺、阜新；河北的开滦、井陉；安徽的淮南；河南的平顶山、鹤壁；山东的淄博和北京市的京西。
    这九个矿务局在今年头八个月都取得了巨大成就，煤炭产量比去年同期有大幅度增长。最近，这些矿务局职工全面总结了前八个月持续跃进的成绩和经验，深入讨论和制定了今后四个月的增产节约计划和保证措施，接着就向全国煤矿职工提出了开展社会主义竞赛的倡议书。
    这九个矿务局职工在倡议书中一致表示要全面完成和超额完成国家计划。他们除要提高产量以外，还要进一步提高煤炭质量，加快掘进工作，节约坑木和加快煤炭运输。如在提高煤炭质量方面，京西矿务局职工保证今后四个月内，凡是外销的煤炭含?率一律不超过1％；淄博矿务局职工也保证，煤炭的灰份和含?率，将比国家计划分别降低8.26％和将近一半。在加快掘进方面，鹤壁矿务局职工保证要进一步运用快速掘进的经验，争取9至12月份平均月进尺比前八个月提高53.8％，获得煤量可采期达到七个月以上；开滦煤矿职工则提出，要大力推广任广金和李长亮两个快速掘进队的经验，保证全矿区掘进日进度达到二千四百多米，争取到年末增加十个回采工作面，获得煤量经常保持在五个半月以上；井陉矿务局职工保证今年他们将超额完成巷道开拓和掘进总进尺计划，这样，不仅可以保证今后四个月增产煤炭的需要，而且还可以为明年生产准备出足够的备用工作面。在节约坑木消耗方面，平顶山、淄博、鹤壁等矿务局的职工提出的指标，都比国家计划降低了10％以上。在加快煤炭运输方面，抚顺矿务局职工提出自9月份起，每天运出的煤炭将从8月份的八百多车增加到九百车以上；淮南矿务局职工则保证货车在矿区的一次作业时间，将由现在的一点三七点钟压缩到一点二四点钟。
    为了保证实现上述各项竞赛条件，这九个矿的职工在倡议书中还提出了各项具体措施。他们一致表示，要继续坚持政治挂帅，大搞群众运动，进一步深入广泛地讨论和制定增产节约的计划和保证措施，并在此基础上深入开展以技术革新和技术革命为中心的大面积高产红旗竞赛运动。对前一时期涌现出来的技术革新项目，将在党委领导下，采用领导干部、工人和技术人员三结合的办法，加以整理鉴定，对那些收效最大和有普遍意义的革新项目，则加以总结、提高和普遍推广，以迅速增加工作面产量，提高掘进速度和提高矿井生产能力。同时要加快煤仓和线路的改造，使运输能力适应生产持续跃进的需要。各矿职工在所提的保证措施中，还特别强调要改进领导作风和工作方法，改进企业管理。例如淮南矿务局决定把70％的干部下放到生产现场，与工人同吃同住同劳动同商量，扎扎实实的抓好小组工作，并建立和健全井下办公制度。开滦煤矿也准备建立局、矿、区三级三班领导值班制，同时在所有领导干部中推行“一、二、三”（一天学习、二天开会办公、三天劳动）制的领导方法，以便进一步加强生产第一线的领导。
    除此以外，各个倡议书中对在开展增产节约运动以后，如何进一步贯彻劳逸结合和安全生产的方针，全面安排好职工生活等，也都提出了具体措施。
    新华社4日讯　煤炭工业部和全国煤矿工会今天向全国煤炭工业职工发出了一封信，信中说，京西、开滦、井陉、抚顺、阜新、平顶山、鹤壁、淮南、淄博九个矿务局的全体职工，为了广泛、深入地开展增产节约运动，向全国煤炭工业职工提出了在安全生产、劳逸结合、保证质量、提高效率、降低成本的前提下，超额完成1960年生产建设任务的竞赛倡议。煤炭工业部和全国煤矿工会认为他们的倡议代表了全国煤炭工业数百万职工的共同志愿。我们号召全体职工热烈响应他们的倡议，鼓足更大的革命干劲，发扬“学、比、赶、帮”共产主义大协作的风格，互相激励，共同跃进，迅速投入以粮、钢为中心的增产节约运动中去，为超额完成今年生产建设任务而奋斗。
    这封信说，为了使增产节约运动开展的既轰轰烈烈，又扎扎实实，我们必须认真地作好以下几项工作：
    一、广泛深入地发动群众。从最近一些企业单位开展增产节约运动的实际情况来看，发动群众应该是由上到下，由党内到党外，由职工到职工家属，全面地、层层地、彻底地交形势、交任务、交措施。只有把当前的大好形势、任务和措施，向职工群众交深、交透，才能使广大职工群众方向明确，任务有底，措施具体，才能调动各方面的积极性，把增产节约运动变成千百万人的自觉行动。在发动群众的基础上，各矿应当通过“对口赛”、“一条龙赛”、“标兵选拔”、“生产运动会”等竞赛形式，掀起一个大面积高产社会主义劳动竞赛的热潮。在竞赛中，应针对生产关键，开展技术革新和技术革命，采取“技术表演”、“先进经验传播队”等方法，大力推广巩固行之有效的先进经验，把苦干、实干和巧干的精神紧密结合起来，使职工群众始终保持着充沛的生产热情。
    二、面向基层，狠抓小组生产工作。搞好生产小组的工作，是开展增产节约运动的重要环节。搞好生产小组工作，又以搞好小组的政治思想工作和充分发动群众讨论国家计划、制订小组具体的作业计划为基础。领导干部和工程技术人员必须深入到小组，同工人群众一起采取大鸣大放大辩论的方法，针对各个采掘工作面不同的特点，进行具体分析，找出生产关键，制订措施。为了保证生产小组实现作业计划，必须加强小组的政治思想领导和组织领导。
    三、加强企业的组织管理工作。必须加强生产第一线的组织配备，健全组织领导。配备足够的和德才兼备的干部，使基层组织适应生产要求。区（段）长的配备原则，应该按四班作业制的要求进行配备，既要每班有区（段）长值班，又要使区（段）长每周有一天轮休，区（段）其他工作人员亦应按此原则配备，以建立严格的责任制度，使班班有人管，事事有人管，及时解决生产中的问题。必须有计划、有步骤、实事求是地健全和建立生产上所必需的规章制度，必须加强科室工作，健全建立计划管理、领导干部值班、调度制度和井下办公制度。同时必须坚决贯彻执行部颁发的安全生产的暂行规定，以保证安全生产。
    四、实现劳逸结合，关心职工生活。在开展增产节约运动的过程中，职工群众的干劲越足，我们越应该关心职工的生活，真正做到一手抓生产，一手抓生活，只有这样才能使运动一浪高一浪，持续地向前发展。各企业事业单位，应该积极地搞好副食品的生产，发动职工群众和家属多种蔬菜、饲料，大养猪、羊和家禽，并办好公共食堂。
    这封信最后说，当前的形势对于我们完成和超额完成今年的生产建设任务，十分有利。我们有党中央和毛主席的正确领导，有持续跃进的基础，目前雨季已过，煤矿的生产建设工作正处在一个“黄金时代”。只要我们趁此大好时光，抓紧时机，鼓足干劲，乘胜前进，把增产节约运动广泛深入的开展起来，我们就一定能够完成和超额完成今年任务，实现煤炭工业的持续大跃进。
