One hundred meetings have been held in the Sino-US ambassadorial talks since they began on August 1, 1955, spanning five years. The five-year negotiation and one hundred meetings between China and the United States most powerfully demonstrate who genuinely wishes to resolve international disputes through negotiation and who stubbornly pursues a policy of armed aggression and threats of force.

In the more than five years of Sino-US talks, there have consistently been two completely opposing attitudes. One is to take the negotiations seriously, striving to achieve some principled and positive agreements, in order to ease the tension between China and the United States and in the Far East caused by US imperialism's occupation of China's territory Taiwan and the US's policy of hostility toward China. This is the Chinese side's attitude. The other is to regard the negotiations as a means to achieve its own imperialist intentions and deceive world public opinion, with no sincerity to resolve disputes between China and the United States through negotiation, but rather to continue to maintain and exacerbate international tensions. This is the American side's attitude. Right and wrong are there for all to see.

The Sino-US talks were brought about by the initiative and efforts of the Chinese government. On April 23, 1955, during the Bandung Conference, Premier Zhou Enlai first stated: "The Chinese government is willing to sit down and negotiate with the US government to discuss the issue of easing tensions in the Far East, especially the tensions in the Taiwan area." At that time, the US government brazenly refused and put forward unreasonable preconditions to obstruct the holding of negotiations. Only under the pressure of world public opinion did the United States reluctantly agree to hold negotiations. During the talks, with the desire to seek agreement, China repeatedly put forward positive proposals. If major issues could not be agreed upon, secondary issues were discussed; if one proposal was not accepted, another proposal was made, demonstrating great patience and sincerity. But what was the US attitude? Its "real intention lies elsewhere." It always used various excuses to reject China's reasonable proposals, stubbornly trying to impose its aggressive intentions on the Chinese people; if it could not achieve its purpose, it would delay and sabotage the talks. At the end of 1957, the US government violated the agreement by refusing to send an ambassador-level representative to attend the meeting, interrupting the talks for as long as half a year. Only because China adopted a firm attitude and carried out a tit-for-tat struggle against the US's military provocations playing the "brinkmanship policy" in the Taiwan Strait area, did it force the United States to return to the negotiating table once again. After the resumption of the talks, the US side continued to adhere to its stubborn position of obstructing the reaching of agreements, and politicians in Washington constantly shouted for the termination of the talks. Is not the United States' lack of sincerity in the Sino-US talks very clear?

The key to the failure of the Sino-US talks to achieve positive results so far lies in US imperialism's persistence in its aggressive policy of hostility towards China. This is most clearly manifested in the main topic of the Sino-US talks—the issue of easing and eliminating tensions in the Taiwan area. The US occupation of Taiwan is a naked act of aggression against China, and the Chinese people have every right to take all measures to resist aggression and safeguard their sovereignty and territorial integrity. The tension caused by the US's persistence in its aggression is naturally not the responsibility of the invaded China, but of the aggressor, US imperialism. Even in this situation, China is still willing to sit down and negotiate with the United States in order to maintain peace in Asia and the world. This alone is enough to show that we advocate resolving international disputes through consultation rather than the use of force. In the talks, China has repeatedly suggested that China and the United States jointly declare that they will resolve disputes between the two countries by peaceful means without resorting to force or the threat of force, and has proposed consultation channels to achieve this goal. However, the United States deliberately confuses the international disputes between China and the United States with China's internal affairs. It not only continues to use force to occupy China's territory Taiwan but demands that China give up the use of force to liberate its own territory Taiwan. Taiwan is Chinese territory, and whether the Chinese people liberate Taiwan by force or by peaceful means is China's internal affair, and the Chinese people's own business. The United States has no right to interfere at all. What the Sino-US talks need to resolve is the international dispute between the two countries caused by the US's armed occupation of China's territory Taiwan. This dispute can only be resolved if the United States agrees to give up the use of force and agrees to withdraw all its armed forces from Taiwan and the Taiwan Strait area. However, the United States insists that it has the so-called "self-defense rights" in Taiwan. This is extremely absurd. The United States has no "self-defense rights" to speak of on Chinese territory; it only has the obligation to withdraw from Chinese territory. The US demand that China shall not use force in the Taiwan area under any circumstances is, in effect, asking China to recognize its right to permanently occupy our territory, while the Chinese people must be deprived of the right to liberate their own territory. The US attempt to permanently occupy China's territory Taiwan and turn it into a US colony is blatant. But the Chinese people will never allow the US imperialist plot to succeed. Do we negotiate with the United States for the purpose of recognizing the legalization of the US occupation of Taiwan? Do we negotiate with the United States to beg for peace from US imperialism at the cost of our own territory Taiwan?

On the issues of civilians returning home, trade, people's exchanges, cultural exchange and exchange of journalists, the United States government's barbaric attitude of hostility towards China is equally exposed. The Chinese people have always believed that it is the US government, representing the interests of the US monopoly capital groups, that persists in its policy of aggression against China, and the American people have always been our friends. The Chinese people are willing to establish and develop friendly relations with the American people. Therefore, we are willing to take positive steps to promote the friendship between the two peoples. During the Sino-US talks, China has put forward positive proposals on the issues of civilians returning home, trade, people's exchanges, cultural exchange and exchange of journalists. However, the US government has tried its best to obstruct any steps that are truly conducive to promoting friendship between the two peoples. Although the two sides reached an agreement on the issue of civilians returning home in 1955, and China abided by the agreement and repatriated American civilians, the United States arbitrarily distorted and sabotaged this only agreement of the Sino-US talks. It not only openly interfered in China's internal affairs, insisting that China release American criminals who had committed serious crimes in China, but has also hindered in every way the return of Chinese civilians in the United States to their motherland. What credibility does the United States have? As for the proposals put forward by China to eliminate trade barriers between the two countries, eliminate barriers to people's exchanges and cultural exchange between the two countries, and allow journalists from both countries to conduct news coverage on an equal and mutually beneficial basis, we believe that if agreements can be reached on these issues, it will not only be conducive to friendly exchanges between the peoples of China and the United States, but also ease the relations between China and the United States, thereby promoting the rapid conclusion of an agreement between China and the United States on the issue of the United States withdrawing all its armed forces from Taiwan and the Taiwan Strait. However, none of these proposals have been rejected by the US government. The United States insists on implementing the so-called "embargo" against China, obstructing exchanges between the peoples of the two countries, and refusing to allow journalists from the two countries to conduct news coverage on the basis of true equality and mutual benefit. From this, it can be seen that the United States has no sincerity to gradually improve Sino-US relations through negotiations.

While the Sino-US talks are going on, what policies and actions have China and the United States taken in international affairs? Over the past five years, the Chinese government has actively supported all the suggestions made by the Soviet Union and other socialist countries that are conducive to easing international tensions, such as disarmament, the abolition of foreign military bases, and the prohibition of nuclear weapons. The Chinese government has also continuously made proposals to strive to ease the tense situation not only in the Taiwan region, but also in the Asian and Pacific regions. Recently, Chinese Premier Zhou Enlai once again suggested that all countries in the Asia-Pacific region, including the United States, conclude a treaty of non-aggression and peace and make this region a nuclear weapon-free zone. This peace proposal has been warmly welcomed by people all over the world. However, the US government openly opposed China's peace initiatives and was unwilling to see the tensions in Taiwan and the Far East ease down. The US armed forces not only stay put in Taiwan and the Taiwan Strait, but also continue to engage in military provocations and threats of force, constantly violating China's territorial waters and airspace. The United States continues to expand its military bases and strengthen aggressive military blocs in the Asia-Pacific region, signed a new military alliance treaty with Japan, and sent cruisers, submarines, and aircraft carrying or capable of carrying nuclear weapons to the Far East, openly clamoring for and preparing to conduct nuclear war. At the same time, the United States has been trying its best to create a "two Chinas" conspiracy, proposing the absurd propositions of "Republic of Formosa" and "trusteeship" of Taiwan, in an attempt to permanently occupy China's territory Taiwan and make it an "unsinkable aircraft carrier" for its aggression against China and the Far East. This is the same as the conspiracy of Japanese militarism in first occupying China's territory Taiwan, and then, after occupying China's Northeast, creating a so-called "Manchukuo," thereby launching a full-scale war of aggression against China and the Far East and the Pacific region. All these facts more clearly expose that what US imperialism is pursuing is to persist in its aggression against China and plot to expand this aggression; to maintain and aggravate the tense situation in the Taiwan Strait and the Far East; to create "two Chinas." Therefore, it is not surprising that the Sino-US talks have been held for more than five years without any progress.

It is clear that US imperialism is unwilling to negotiate seriously, delaying and obstructing negotiations, and trying its best to sabotage negotiations, but US imperialism and its followers have recently attacked China for "unwilling to negotiate seriously," "creating tension," and "being bellicose," and so on. May I ask, are the Chinese people, whose territory is occupied by the United States, but still patiently negotiating peace with the United States for as long as five years, unwilling to negotiate seriously, creating tension, and being bellicose, or are the US imperialists who occupy Chinese territory by force and refuse to let go, are unreasonable in negotiations, and constantly make threats of force, unwilling to negotiate seriously, creating tension, and being bellicose? The facts are all there, and the slanderers' lies inverting black and white cannot deceive people.

The Chinese people have always advocated that international disputes should be resolved through peaceful negotiations rather than resorting to force or threats of force. Moreover, we believe that as long as both sides of the negotiations are sincere in resolving the problem, certain results can be achieved. It is with this belief that we have been negotiating with the United States. However, the Chinese people have rich experience in dealing with imperialism, especially US imperialism, and know very well that US imperialism has never been willing to consult with others on an equal footing and reasonably solve problems. We are willing to negotiate with all countries, including the United States, to resolve international disputes, but this can only be negotiations on an equal footing. We are willing to reach agreements with all countries, including the United States, but these can only be fair and reasonable agreements. We also know deeply from personal experience that US imperialism will not easily agree to negotiate; even if it agrees to negotiate, it will not easily reach an agreement; even if an agreement is reached, it will not honestly abide by it. To force US imperialism to accept negotiations, reach a certain agreement, and ensure that these agreements are implemented without being sabotaged, it is necessary to go through serious and persistent struggles. The experience of the Korean armistice negotiations is like this. The experience of negotiations to restore peace in Indochina is also like this. In the Sino-US talks, China has always maintained a firm position, on the one hand, seriously negotiating with the United States and striving for agreements, and on the other hand, not cherishing unrealistic illusions about the negotiations. We have never relaxed our vigilance against US imperialism because of negotiations with the United States, nor have we relaxed our struggle against US imperialist aggression and for the liberation of Taiwan. The experience of one hundred meetings of the Sino-US talks has proved that the attitude we have adopted towards the negotiations is completely necessary and correct.

The Sino-US talks have reached one hundred times, and the time has been five years. As long as the US government is willing to continue talking, China is willing to continue talking with it. However, we want to solemnly warn the US government: if you have any sincerity in negotiating, then you must conduct the negotiations seriously. Otherwise, you will not be able to escape the condemnation of the people of the world and will fall into an increasingly passive situation.

### 中美会谈一百次

    中美会谈一百次
    中美两国大使级会谈自1955年8月1日开始以来，已经过了五年，举行了一百次会议。中美之间五年谈判、一百次会议的过程，最有力不过地说明了，谁真正愿意通过谈判解决国际争端，谁顽固地执行武装侵略和武力威胁的政策。
    在五年多的中美会谈中，自始至终存在着两种完全相反的态度。一种是认真对待谈判，努力促使谈判达成一些原则性积极性的协议，以和缓由于美帝国主义霸占中国领土台湾以及美国敌视中国的政策所造成的中美之间和远东的紧张局势。这是中国方面的态度。另一种是把谈判看成是实现自己的帝国主义意图和欺骗世界舆论的手段，丝毫没有诚意经过谈判解决中美之间的争端，而宁愿继续保持和加剧国际紧张局势。这是美国方面的态度。是非黑白，有目共睹。
    中美会谈是由于中国政府的倡议和努力促成的。1955年4月23日在万隆会议期间，我国周恩来总理首先表示：“中国政府愿意同美国政府坐下来谈判，讨论和缓远东紧张局势的问题，特别是和缓台湾地区的紧张局势问题”。当时美国政府竟悍然拒绝，而且提出无理的先决条件来阻挠举行谈判。只是在世界舆论的压力下，美国才不得不勉强同意举行谈判。在会谈当中，我国本着谋求协议的愿望，一而再、再而三地提出积极性的建议，主要问题谈不拢，改谈次要问题；这个建议不接受，改提那个建议；表现了极大的耐心和诚意。而美国的态度又如何呢？“醉翁之意不在酒”，总是以各种各样的借口拒绝我国的合理建议，硬要把它的侵略意图强加在中国人民的头上；达不到目的，就拖延和破坏会谈。在1957年底，美国政府就曾经违反协议，以拒绝派遣大使级代表出席会议的办法，中断会谈达半年之久。只是由于我国采取了严正的态度，并且同美国在台湾海峡地区玩弄“战争边缘政策”的军事挑衅，进行了针锋相对的斗争，才迫使美国不得不又一次回到谈判桌子上来。会谈恢复以后，美国方面照旧坚持它阻挠达成协议的顽固立场，而且华盛顿的政客还不时发出主张停止会谈的叫嚷。美国对于中美会谈的毫无诚意，不是十分清楚的吗？
    中美会谈迄今未能取得积极的成果，关键在于美帝国主义坚持敌视中国的侵略政策。这在中美会谈中的主要议题——关于和缓和消除台湾地区紧张局势的问题上表现得最清楚。美国霸占台湾是对中国的赤裸裸的侵略行为，中国人民完全有权采取一切措施，反抗侵略，维护自己主权和领土完整。由于美国坚持它的侵略而造成的紧张局势，其责任自然不在被侵略的中国方面，而在侵略者美帝国主义方面。即使在这种情况下，中国方面为了维护亚洲和世界和平，还是愿意同美国坐下来谈判。仅这一点就足以说明，我们是主张通过协商而不使用武力解决国际争端的。在会谈中，我国又一再建议，中美共同声明用和平方法解决两国之间的争端而不诉诸武力或武力威胁，并且提出为了达到这目的的协商途径。但是，美国却故意把中美之间的国际争端同中国的内政问题混淆起来，它不但继续使用武力霸占我国领土台湾，反而要求我国放弃使用武力解放自己的领土台湾。台湾是中国的领土，中国人民用武力还是和平方式解放台湾是中国的内政，是中国人民自己的事情，美国根本无权过问。中美会谈需要解决的，是由于美国以武力侵占了中国领土台湾而造成的两国之间的国际争端，这个争端只能由美国同意放弃使用武力，同意从台湾和台湾海峡地区撤出它的一切武装力量来解决。可是美国却坚持它在台湾有所谓“自卫权力”。这是极端荒谬的。美国在中国的领土上没有什么“自卫权力”可言，它有的只是从中国领土撤走的义务。美国要求我国在任何情况下不得在台湾地区使用武力，实际上是要中国承认它有永远霸占我国领土的权利，而中国人民却必须被剥夺解放自己领土的权利。美国企图永久霸占我国领土台湾，把它变成为美国殖民地的野心是昭然若揭的。但是中国人民是绝对不会让美帝国主义的阴谋得逞的。难道我们同美国谈判，就为的是去承认美国霸占台湾的合法化吗？难道我国同美国谈判，就为的是要用自己的领土台湾作为代价去向美帝国主义乞求和平吗？
    在平民回国、贸易、人民来往、文化交流和互换记者等问题上，同样暴露了美国政府敌视中国的蛮横态度。中国人民从来认为坚持侵略中国政策的是代表美国垄断资本集团利益的美国政府。至于美国人民，他们从来就是我们的朋友，中国人民愿意同美国人民建立和发展友好关系。因之我们愿意采取积极的步骤，来促进两国人民的友谊。在中美会谈期间，我国在平民回国、贸易、人民来往、文化交流和互换记者等问题上，都提出了积极的建议。可是美国政府却竭力阻挠采取任何真正有利于促进两国人民友谊的步骤。虽然双方在1955年达成了平民回国问题的协议，而且我方遵守协议，遣返了美国平民；但是美国竟连中美会谈的这个唯一的协议，也任意曲解和破坏。它不仅公然干涉中国内政，硬要我国释放在中国犯有严重罪行的美国犯人，而且至今多方阻挠，不让在美国的中国平民回到自己的祖国。试问美国有何信义可言？至于我国提出的消除两国之间的贸易障碍、消除两国人民来往和文化交流的障碍、两国记者在平等互惠基础上相互进行新闻采访等建议，我们认为，如果能就这些问题达成协议，不仅有利于中美两国人民的友好来往，也能和缓中美两国之间的关系，从而促使中美两国就美国从台湾和台湾海峡撤出一切武装力量问题迅速达成协议。但是，这些建议，无一不遭到美国政府的拒绝。美国坚持对中国实行所谓“禁运”，阻挠两国人民来往，拒绝在真正的平等互惠的基础上让两国记者相互进行新闻采访。由此可见，美国又有什么通过谈判来逐步改善中美关系的诚意可言？
    在中美会谈进行的同时，中美两国在国际事务中所采取的政策和行动又是怎样的呢？五年来，中国政府积极支持苏联和其他社会主义国家所采取的一切有利于和缓国际紧张局势的有关裁军、撤销外国军事基地，禁止核武器的建议。中国政府也不断提出建议，争取不仅在台湾地区，而且在亚洲和太平洋地区和缓紧张局势。最近我国周恩来总理再次建议亚洲和太平洋地区的一切国家，包括美国在内，缔结一项互不侵犯的和平公约，并且使这个地区成为无核武器区域。这个和平建议得到了全世界人民的热烈欢迎。但是，美国政府对于我国的和平倡议却公然反对，不愿意看到台湾和远东地区的紧张局势和缓下来。美国的武装力量不仅赖在台湾和台湾海峡不走，而且不断进行军事挑衅和武力威胁，不断侵犯中国领海领空。美国在亚洲和太平洋地区继续扩大军事基地，加强侵略性的军事集团，同日本签订了新的军事同盟条约，把装载或能够装载核武器的巡洋舰、潜水艇和飞机派到远东地区，公开叫嚣和准备进行核战争。与此同时，美国千方百计地进行制造“两个中国”的阴谋，提出所谓“中华福摩萨国”、“托管”台湾等等永远霸占中国领土台湾的荒谬主张，妄想使台湾成为它侵略中国和远东地区的“不沉的航空母舰”。这同当年日本军国主义首先霸占我国领土台湾，继而在侵占我国东北之后，制造一个所谓“满洲国”，从而对中国和远东以及太平洋地区发动全面侵略战争的阴谋，如出一辙。这一切事实，更清楚地暴露了美帝国主义所追求的，是要坚持它对中国的侵略，并且阴谋扩大这种侵略；是要保持和加剧台湾海峡地区和远东地区的紧张局势；是要制造“两个中国”。因此，中美会谈举行了五年多，至今没有任何进展，这就毫不奇怪了。
    明明是美帝国主义不愿意认真谈判，拖延和阻挠谈判，而且竭力想破坏谈判，但是美帝国主义和它的追随者近来却大肆攻击中国“不愿意认真谈判”、“制造紧张”、“好战”，等等。试问，是自己的领土被美国霸占，而仍然耐心地同美国进行和平谈判达五年之久的中国人民不愿意认真谈判、制造紧张、好战呢，还是用武力霸占了中国领土不肯放手，在谈判中蛮不讲理，并且不断进行武力威胁的美帝国主义不愿意认真谈判、制造紧张、好战呢？事实俱在，诽谤者的这种颠倒黑白的谰言，是骗不了人的。
    中国人民一贯主张国际争端应当通过和平谈判求得解决而不诉诸武力或者武力威胁。而且我们认为，只要谈判的双方都具备解决问题的诚意，是能够取得一定成果的。我们正是本着这样的信念来同美国谈判的。但是中国人民同帝国主义、特别是美帝国主义打交道有着丰富的经验，深知美帝国主义从来就不愿在平等的基础上同别人协商，合理解决问题。我们愿意同一切国家，包括美国在内，进行谈判，解决国际争端，但是这只能是在平等基础上的谈判。我们愿意同一切国家，包括美国在内，达成协议，但是这只能是公平合理的协议。我们也从切身经验深深知道，美帝国主义是不会轻易同意进行谈判的；就是同意了谈判，也不会轻易达成协议的；就是达成了协议，也不会老老实实地遵守的。要迫使美帝国主义接受谈判，达成某种协议，并且使这些协议得到执行而不被破坏，必须经过严重和坚持不懈的斗争。朝鲜停战谈判的经验就是如此。恢复印度支那和平的谈判的经验也是如此。我国在中美会谈中，一直是抱着坚定的立场，一方面认真地同美国谈判，努力谋求协议，另一方面也并不对谈判存着不切实际的幻想。我们从来没有因为同美国谈判而放松对美帝国主义的警惕，或者放松反对美帝国主义侵略和为解放台湾而进行的斗争。中美会谈一百次会议的经历证明了我们对待谈判所采取的态度是完全必要和正确的。
    中美会谈已达一百次，时间已经五年。只要美国政府还愿意谈下去，中国方面是愿意继续同它谈的。但是，我们要严正地警告美国政府：如果你们还有丝毫谈判诚意，那就必须认真地进行谈判。否则，就决逃不脱世界人民的谴责，而陷入越来越被动的境地。
