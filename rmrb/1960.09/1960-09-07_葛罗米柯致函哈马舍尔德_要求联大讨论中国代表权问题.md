Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 6th (TASS): Soviet Foreign Minister Gromyko's letter to UN Secretary-General Hammarskjöld:

Mr. Secretary-General,

I am authorized by the Government of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics to request that the following issue be included in the agenda of the Fifteenth Session of the United Nations General Assembly:

“China’s Representation in the United Nations”;

In accordance with Article 20 of the Rules of Procedure of the General Assembly, a memorandum is attached.

Respectfully,
Soviet Foreign Minister Gromyko
Moscow, September 5, 1960

Memorandum

According to the Charter of the United Nations, the basic purposes of the United Nations are: to maintain international peace and security, and to develop friendly relations among nations based on respect for the principle of equal rights and self-determination of peoples.

Regrettably, the above-mentioned principles of the United Nations Charter have been violated for a long time. The People's Republic of China, the most populous country in the world, has been deprived of the opportunity to participate in the work of the United Nations, while the Chiang Kai-shek clique, overthrown by the Chinese people and entrenched on Taiwan Island—an integral part of the People's Republic of China—under the protection of American bayonets and occupying the island under the occupation of American troops, occupies China's seat in the United Nations.

This situation arises because the governments of certain member states of the United Nations, primarily the United States government, adopt a negative attitude towards the national system established by the Chinese people. Disregarding the provisions of the United Nations Charter ratified by their legislative bodies, they use every means to prevent Chinese representatives from participating in the work of the United Nations. The policy of those countries that obstruct the People's Republic of China from participating in United Nations activities proves that these countries are unwilling to earnestly develop international cooperation, but instead want to use the United Nations to achieve selfish goals that have nothing in common with the United Nations Charter. In the eleven years since its founding, the People's Republic of China, which accounts for a quarter of the world's population, has made tremendous achievements in the political, economic, and social fields.

The People's Republic of China has consistently pursued a peaceful foreign policy, and its role in the international arena has grown year by year.

China is a founding member of the United Nations and a permanent member of the Security Council, which bears primary responsibility for maintaining international peace and security. Restoring the legitimate rights of the People's Republic of China in the United Nations will greatly enhance the prestige and authority of the United Nations, will be a major contribution to the general normalization of the international situation, and will promote the United Nations in fulfilling its tasks under the Charter.

Depriving the People's Republic of China of the opportunity to participate in United Nations activities has caused great damage to the United Nations itself, greatly limiting the possibilities of the United Nations in developing international cooperation. Continuing to delay the active resolution of the issue of China's representation in the United Nations will only complicate the situation and cause losses to the United Nations. Therefore, it is necessary for the United Nations General Assembly to discuss the issue of China's representation at this session and to pass a resolution on inviting the government of the People's Republic of China to participate in the activities of the United Nations and on excluding the Chiang Kai-shek elements who have illegally usurped China's seat in the United Nations from all United Nations bodies.

    葛罗米柯致函哈马舍尔德
    要求联大讨论中国代表权问题
    新华社讯　塔斯社莫斯科6日电：苏联外交部长葛罗米柯给联合国秘书长哈马舍尔德的信：
    秘书长先生，
    我受苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟政府的委托，请求把下列问题列入联合国大会第十五届会议议程：
    “中国在联合国的代表权”；
    根据大会议事规则第二十条，谨附说明书。		此致
    敬意			苏联外交部长　葛罗米柯				  1960年9月5日于莫斯科
    说明书
    根据联合国宪章，联合国的基本宗旨是：维护国际和平和安全，在尊重各国人民平等和自决权原则的基础上，发展各国之间的友好关系。
    遗憾的是，很长时期以来，联合国宪章的上述原则一直遭到破坏。世界上人口最多的一个国家中华人民共和国被剥夺了参加联合国工作的机会，而被中国人民推翻了的、在美国刺刀的保护下盘踞在美国军队占领的台湾岛——中华人民共和国不可分割的一部分——的蒋介石集团却占据着中国在联合国的席位。
    产生这种情况，是因为联合国的某些会员国的政府，首先是美国政府对中国人民建立的国家制度采取否定的态度，它们不顾它们的立法机构所批准的联合国宪章的条款，利用一切手段不让中国代表参加联合国的工作。阻挠中华人民共和国参加联合国活动的那些国家的这种政策证明，这些国家不愿意认真发展国际合作，而是想利用联合国达到同联合国宪章毫无共同之处的自私目的。占世界人口四分之一的中华人民共和国在它成立的十一年来，无论在政治方面，还是在经济和社会方面，都取得了巨大的成就。
    中华人民共和国始终不变地执行和平的外交政策，它在国际上的作用逐年增长。
    中国是联合国的创始国，是对维护国际和平和安全负有主要责任的安全理事会的常任理事国。恢复中华人民共和国在联合国的合法权利，将会在很大程度上提高联合国的威望和威信，将是对国际局势普遍正常化的重大贡献，将会促进联合国完成它根据宪章所承担的任务。
    剥夺中华人民共和国参加联合国活动的机会，使联合国本身遭到巨大的损害，大大地限制了联合国在发展国际合作方面的可能性。继续拖延积极地解决中华人民共和国在联合国的代表权问题，只会使局势复杂化和使联合国遭受损失。因此，必需使联合国大会在这次会议上讨论中国的代表权问题和通过关于邀请中华人民共和国政府参加联合国的活动和关于把非法窃据中国在联合国的席位的蒋介石分子从联合国各个机构中排除出去的决议。
