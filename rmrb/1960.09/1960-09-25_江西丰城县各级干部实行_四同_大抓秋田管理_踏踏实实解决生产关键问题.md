According to Jiangxi Daily: Three thousand seven hundred and thirty-six cadres from the county, commune, and brigade levels in Fengcheng County have gone down to the grassroots level, deep into the fields, working together with grassroots cadres and the broad masses of commune members to vigorously develop agriculture and grain production, helping grassroots cadres improve their leadership skills, and leading the masses to manage autumn fields more carefully. As a result, a newer situation has emerged in the county's rural areas.

In accordance with the spirit of vigorously developing agriculture and grain production, the vast number of cadres who have been sent down to the grassroots level have taken on practical leadership positions in communes, brigades, production teams, pig farms, canteens, and kindergartens, mainly participating in production and leading production. Some of them have gone to advanced areas with large production tasks and high yields, while more have gone to areas with a poor work foundation, weak leadership, and relatively backward production, in order to promote the comprehensive and balanced development of rural work throughout the county. Currently, most of the county's twenty-nine people's communes, seven hundred and thirty-four production brigades, and four thousand three hundred production teams have cadres sent down to work together with the masses, implementing "Four Togetherness," vigorously grasping autumn field management, and striving for a bumper harvest for the whole year.

After the vast number of cadres went deep into the grassroots level to take on substantive positions, they actively participated in production, led production, conducted in-depth investigations and research, and relied on the masses to effectively solve key production problems. Sun Longfu, Deputy Secretary of the County Party Committee, who was sent down to the Shitan Commune to serve as the Commune Party Secretary, discovered during labor that some people were still weeding by hand, and that some were not actively using weeding tools. After further investigation, it turned out that the existing weeding tools had shortcomings such as not weeding cleanly and smearing mud. After in-depth investigation and analysis of the reasons, Secretary Sun invited carpenters from the commune's farm tool factory and activists among the masses who used advanced tools to implement "three combinations," bringing together all kinds of weeding tools that had been used in the commune, comparing them, taking the advantages and discarding the disadvantages, and making a palm-shaped weeding tool that could weed two or three rows at a time. It was taken to various teams throughout the commune for trial use. Because it weeded quickly and cleanly, was flexible and easy to use, and was also low in cost, the masses liked to use it, which greatly accelerated the weeding progress. Ge Xizai, Deputy Secretary of the Party General Branch of the Zhongzhou Management Area of ​​Tuochuan Commune, was sent down to the Zhongzhou Brigade as the Party Branch Secretary. While working in the Taqian team, he found that 60 mu of late double-cropping rice in this team had only been weeded once, and the reason for the many weeds was that the team's labor force was not planned, and no specific arrangements were made after the first weeding. After finding the key to the problem, Ge Xizai and the team cadres jointly calculated the labor force account, adjusted the labor force according to the current needs of late rice field management, and concentrated on weeding late rice. In just four days, all 60 mu of late double-cropping rice, which had previously only been weeded once, were weeded twice.

The county's cadres who go deep into the grassroots level, deep into field production, investigate and study, and solve problems not only greatly promote current production, but also help grassroots cadres improve their leadership style and improve their leadership level. Yu Cairen, the newly arrived Party General Branch Secretary of the Rongtang Management Area of ​​Tuochuan Commune, was universally praised by cadres at all levels in the entire management area for helping analyze and deal with problems.

At the same time, the cadres who were sent down also went deep into welfare undertakings such as canteens and kindergartens to care about the lives of the masses. This thorough and meticulous work style has been enthusiastically welcomed by the masses and grassroots cadres. At present, under the call of vigorously developing agriculture and grain production, it is considered an honor to participate in agricultural production everywhere. Examples of actively contributing to increasing agricultural production and making suggestions are constantly emerging. High labor attendance rates and high work efficiency in rural areas throughout the county have become a widespread phenomenon, and the progress of autumn field management has been universally accelerated.

    江西丰城县各级干部实行“四同”大抓秋田管理
    踏踏实实解决生产关键问题
    本报讯　据江西日报消息：丰城县下放到基层的三千七百三十六名县、公社、大队干部，深入田间，同基层干部和广大社员一道，大办农业、大办粮食，帮助基层干部提高领导水平，领导群众更细致地搞好秋田管理。全县农村由此出现了一个更新的局面。
    根据大办农业、大办粮食的精神，下放到基层的广大干部，分别担任了公社、大队、生产队以及养猪场、食堂、幼儿园的实际领导职务，主要是参加生产，领导生产。他们中，有些人到生产任务大、产量高的先进地区，更多的人则到工作基础差、领导力量弱、生产较落后的地区，以促进全县农村工作全面均衡发展。现在，全县二十九个人民公社、七百三十四个生产大队、四千三百多个生产小队中，大部分都有下放干部和群众一起，实行“四同”，大抓秋田管理，力争全年丰收。
    广大干部深入基层担任实职后，都积极参加生产，领导生产，深入进行调查研究，依靠群众切实解决生产关键问题。县委副书记孙隆富同志，下放在石滩公社任公社党委书记，在劳动时发现部分人仍旧用手耘田，有的使用耘禾工具也不够积极。深入一了解，原来是现有的几种耘禾工具存在耘草不净、耘泥不糊等缺点。深入调查、分析原因后，孙书记便邀集公社农具厂木工，和群众中使用先进工具的积极分子，实行“三结合”，把全公社原使用过的各种耘禾工具集中起来，互相评比，取优去劣，突击改装，制成了一种一次能耘两三行的掌形耘禾工具，拿到全社各队试用。由于它耘草又快又净，使用灵活轻便，造价也低，群众喜爱使用，从而大大加快了耘田进度。拖船公社中洲管理区党总支副书记葛喜崽同志，下放到中洲大队任党支部书记。在塔前小队劳动时，发现这个小队有六十亩二季晚稻只耘一次，草多的原因，是小队劳动力安排没有计划，耘完第一次以后，没有再作具体安排。找出了问题的关键，葛喜崽又同小队干部共同算劳动力账，按当前晚稻田间管理的需要，调整了劳动力，突击晚稻耘田，只四天，将原来仅耘一次的六十亩二季晚稻全部耘了二次。
    全县下放干部深入基层、深入田间生产，调查研究，解决问题，不仅大大促进了当前生产，同时帮助基层干部改进了领导作风，提高了领导水平。拖船公社荣塘管理区新来的党总支书记于财仁同志，不论在帮助分析问题和处理问题时，都受到全管理区各级干部的普遍称赞。
    与此同时，下放干部们还深入食堂、幼儿园等福利事业单位，关心群众生活。这种深入细致的工作作风，普遍受到群众和基层干部的热情欢迎。目前，在大办农业、大办粮食的号召下，处处以参加农业生产为荣。积极为农业增产立功献计的事例不断涌现。全县农村劳动出勤率高、工效高，已成为普遍的现象，秋田管理进度普遍加快了。
