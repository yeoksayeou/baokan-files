    Ode to the Mountains
　　Yang Shi
    I especially love mountains. Probably because I grew up in a mountainous area, I have had feelings for mountains since I was a child. In the evening, when I saw the sun setting in the west and the moon rising in the east, I always thought there was a strange world inside the mountains. Sometimes, when the fog was heavy and the clouds were low, the mountains seemed to stretch out halfway into the sky; other times, when the sun was bright and the wind was clear, the green mountains were closely connected to the blue sky, like a ladder to heaven. Whenever there was a slanting sun after rain, I could see a rainbow connecting the mountains from this end to that end. The old people said that if you broke the rainbow with a carrying pole, many pearls and treasures would flow out. And in the dark night when the moon set and the stars faded, the mountains stood out abruptly, strangely shaped, arousing many associations of tigers, leopards, wolves, demons, and ghosts. All of these left indelible impressions in my childhood memories. The hopes, fantasies, and even joys, angers, sorrows, and pleasures of a child were inseparable from the mountains.

    In the years of participating in the revolutionary war, I became even more inextricably linked to the mountains. At that time, I walked through many deep mountains and great ridges, climbed many steep cliffs and dangerous rocks, and drilled through many mountain pits and stone caves. At that time, I was often moved by the wonders of nature, attracted by the beauty and rich resources of nature, and envisioned building a reclamation farm there one day, building a hydroelectric power station there, and opening a sanatorium there. But more often, I planned where to station troops, where to put up sentries, where to store grain, and where to set up a hospital. We were often happy to obtain a favorable ambush terrain, often racked our brains to defend a narrow pass, and often paid a bloody price to capture a certain mountain. At this time, my feelings for the mountains were not ordinary feelings, but revolutionary feelings. There is a peculiar natural phenomenon in mountainous areas. When the night is about to end and dawn is approaching, the first ray of red light appearing on the horizon always shines on the mountain tops first, the sun is bright, and the mountain color is verdant. This often reminds me of the revolutionary masses in the mountainous areas. In the most difficult days, they always resolutely followed the Party and spared no effort to support the People's Liberation Army. Therefore, in the "Lingyan Pavilion" of the people's revolution, the poor revolutionary people in the mountainous areas are always ranked in the first row.

    I truly recognized the mountainous areas and loved them even more after liberation. I have seen many well-known or unknown mountains in the province, and they all attract people with their majestic momentum. Whether it is Shikengkong in northern Guangdong, Wuzhi Mountain in Hainan, Jieyang Ridge in eastern Guangdong, or the Ten Thousand Great Mountains in western Guangdong, they are all so imposing and full of grandeur. Some rise from the ground, proudly standing among the peaks, "three feet three inches away from the sky"; others stretch westward in layers, with thousands of horses circling, "overturning the sea and rivers, rolling up giant waves"; still others have strange peaks standing upright, pointing directly at the sky, "the edge that pierces the blue sky is not yet broken." People love the climate of Lingnan, and the formation of the climate of Lingnan, in addition to latitude, the Nanling Mountains play a decisive role. It is the Nanling Mountains that block the cold air currents coming from Siberia, making Lingnan like spring all year round, with a hundred flowers in full bloom; it is also the Nanling Mountains that block the large amount of water vapor floating from the Pacific Ocean, storing 1,700 millimeters of rainfall every year, nourishing all things. You see, the mountains always bear the wind and rain themselves, and give warmth and rain to others, standing still for a thousand years, ten thousand years.

    Not only that! The mountains have always been the kind nannies of mankind. Five hundred thousand years ago, the distant ancestors of mankind lived in the mountains all year round. After moving to the plains, they still demanded a large amount of production resources and living materials from the mountainous areas. However, only in our great socialist country have the mountainous areas truly become rich and beautiful. If you take a bird's-eye view of the ground from the air, you will find how lovable the beautiful rivers and mountains below are. Among the overlapping mountains, suddenly mountains surround the water, with clear waves and vast expanses, these are the Xinfengjiang, Liuxihe, and countless artificial lakes and large reservoirs; suddenly, a few red spots in the green, that is, the forestry workers are carrying out the socialist red flag competition; suddenly, the clouds and smoke are filled with the glittering pearl electric lights, that is, the miners are taking treasures in the treasure mountain; suddenly, the rice flowers are fragrant above the white clouds, that is, the mountain people have planted rice on the hills. Just think about it! The white rattan of Limuling, the tea of ​​Phoenix Mountain, the Dongru of Beishan, the rosin of Jiulian, the seedlings and bamboo of Guangning, the cassia bark of Dongxing, the Amomum villosum of Yangchun, the civet cats of Deqing, ... In which era can all the benefits of mountain forests, grasses and trees play such a significant role as they do today!

    However, the mountainous areas can give the socialist society far more than they have already given. Guangdong province is seven parts mountains, one part water and two parts fields, which shows the importance of building mountainous areas for building socialism. Today, the bright pearl on the Pearl River—Guangzhou, more than 2,000 years ago was just a small fishing village at the foot of Baiyun Mountain. Shantou City was just a barren island on the edge of Sangpu Mountain more than 100 years ago. Maoming City and Tongshi in Hainan were new cities built on vacant land in just a few years. It is better to build cities than to linger in cities. Let us continue to respond to the call of the Provincial Party Committee, go to the countryside, go to the mountainous areas, go to Hainan Island, and with the construction of mines, forest farms, livestock farms, and reclamation farms, build thousands upon thousands of new towns and build the mountainous and rural areas more beautiful!

    山颂
　　杨石
    我特别爱山。大概因为是山区长大的，从小就对山有了感情。傍晚，看见日落西山，月上东山，总以为山里面有一个奇异的世界。有时雾重云低，山好像伸出半截在天外；有时日朗风清，青山又紧接着蓝天，好像上天去的梯子。每当雨后斜阳，就可看到一道彩虹从山的这头连到那头。老人家说，用扁担把虹打断，会有许多珍珠宝贝流出来；而在月落星沉的黑夜，群山又突兀峥嵘，怪模怪样，引起人许多虎豹豺狼、妖魔鬼怪的联想。所有这些，都在童年的记忆中留下不可磨灭的印象，小孩子的希望、幻想，以至喜怒哀乐，都离不了山。
    在参加革命战争的岁月里，更和山结下了不解之缘。那时候，走过许多深山大岭，攀过许多峭壁危崖，钻过许多山坑石洞。当时也常被造化之功所感动，被大自然之美和丰富蕴藏所吸引，设想着有朝一日在那里搞一个垦殖场，在那里建一个水电站，在那里辟一个疗养区。但是更多的是计划着该在哪里驻军，在哪里放哨，在哪里屯粮，在哪里摆伤病院。我们常为获得一个有利的伏击地形而高兴，常为守住一条隘路而煞费苦心，常为攻占某个山头而付出血的代价。这时候，同山的感情就不是一般的感情，而是革命的感情了。山区有一个奇异的自然景象，当黑夜将尽，黎明到来的时候，地平线上最初露出的一抹红光，总是首先照射在山头上，阳光灿烂，山色苍翠。这常使我联想到山区的革命群众。他们在最艰苦的日子里，总是坚决地跟着党走，不顾一切地出尽力量来支援人民子弟兵。因而在人民革命的“凌烟阁”上，山区贫苦的革命人民，总是被排在第一列。
    真正认识山区，更加热爱山区是在解放以后。全省知名或不知名的山看了不少，它们都以自己雄伟的气魄吸引着人。无论是粤北的石坑崆，海南的五指山，粤东的揭阳岭，粤西的十万大山，都是那么形势磅礴，气象万千。或则拔地而起，独傲群峰，“离天三尺三”；或则叠嶂西驰，万马回旋，“倒海翻江卷巨澜”；或则奇峰兀立，直指苍穹，“刺破青天锷未残”。人们都热爱岭南气候，岭南气候的形成，除了纬度之外，南岭山脉起了决定作用。是南岭山脉挡住了从西伯利亚南来的寒流，使岭南四季如春，万花簇锦；也是南岭山脉拦住了太平洋上飘来的大量水蒸汽，蕴藏着每年一千七百公厘的雨量，滋润着万物。你看，山总是自己承担着狂风暴雨，而把温暖和雨露给与别人，一千年，一万年也屹然不动。
    岂但如此而已！山从来就是人类慈祥的保姆。五十万年以前，人类的远祖就是终年生活在山里的。搬到平原以后，仍然向山区索取着大量的生产资源和生活资料。但是，只有在我们伟大的社会主义国度里，山区才真正变得富饶、美丽起来。如果你从空中鸟瞰一下地面，就会发现下面的一片锦绣山河如何逗人喜爱。在重峦叠嶂之间，忽然山环水绕，碧波万顷，那是新丰江、流溪河和数不清的人工湖、大水库；一忽儿，万绿丛中数点红，那是林区工人在进行着社会主义的红旗竞赛；一忽儿，云烟弥漫之中闪耀着珠光电炬，那是矿山工人在宝山取宝；一忽儿，白云之上飘着稻花香，那是山区人民把水稻种上了山岗。试想想吧！黎母岭的白藤，凤凰山的茶叶，北山的东茹，九连的松脂，广宁的苗竹，东兴的桂皮，阳春的砂仁，德庆的果子狸，……所有山林草木之利，有哪一个时代能像今天这样，发挥着如此重大的作用呢！
    但是，山区可能给予社会主义社会的远比已经给予的多得多。广东全省是七山一水两分田，这就可以看出建设山区对建设社会主义的重要意义了。今天珠江上的夜明珠——广州，二千多年前只不过是白云山麓的一个小渔村，汕头市在一百多年前也只是桑浦山边的一片荒洲；茂名市和海南的通什，更是几年之间在空地上建设起来的新城市。留恋城市不如去建设城市，让我们继续响应省委的号召，到农村去，到山区去，到海南岛去，随着矿场、林场、畜牧场、垦殖场的建设，把千千万万个新城镇建设起来，把山区和农村建设得更美丽吧！
