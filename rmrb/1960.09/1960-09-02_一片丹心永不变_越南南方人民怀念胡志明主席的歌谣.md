A Loyal Heart Forever Unchanged
——Songs of the People of South Vietnam Remembering Ho Chi Minh

Who goes to North Vietnam? The road is long, winding, and steep. With a loyal heart and a few words: I wish President Ho good health and happiness, bringing joy to the Vietnamese people.

＊＊＊

Although the enemy occupies the land, how can they occupy the hearts of the Vietnamese people! Even if the seas run dry and the rocks crumble, the hearts of the people of Hue remain unchanged, still President Ho's people, following the golden star on the red flag for a lifetime!

＊＊＊

The moon in the sky waxes and wanes, the water in the river is deep and shallow. Whoever goes north, please convey a message to Uncle Ho: The hearts of the southern people are as round as the bamboo hat on their heads! Salt remains salty after three years, ginger remains spicy no matter how many times it's boiled. No matter how eloquent you are, a loyal heart will never change!

    一片丹心永不变
    ——越南南方人民怀念
        胡志明主席的歌谣谁去越北？遥遥迢迢，弯弯曲曲，蜿蜒峻峭。碧血丹心，数言寥寥：祝贺胡主席健康愉快，给越南人民带来幸福和欢笑。
            ＊＊＊尽管敌人把土地占领，怎能占得了越南人的心情！尽管海枯石烂，顺化人民的心依然不变，仍是胡主席的老百姓，一辈子跟着红旗上的金星！
            ＊＊＊天上月亮有阴晴圆缺，河下的水有深有浅，谁去北方请给胡伯伯捎上话，南方人民的心，永远像头上竹笠那般圆！盐咸三年还咸，姜辣几个都辣，任凭你巧语花言，一片丹心永不变！
