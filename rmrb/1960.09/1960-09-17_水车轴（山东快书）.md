    Waterwheel Axle (Shandong Kuai Shu) Zhang Jun
    Just to guarantee a bumper harvest,
    Something happened in our commune.
    Our commune has a Red Flag Production Team,
    Which is the rival of the Forward Team in competition.
    The two teams are competing more and more vigorously,
    Both want to win the red flag and be in the lead.
    Strive for a bumper crop of radishes,
    And double the yield of millet and corn!
    The Red Flag team members eat and live on the front line,
    The men and women, old and young, of the Forward Team work even harder.
    The first weeding was done well,
    The second fertilizing and management were really meticulous.
    Just when it was time to water extensively,
    Who knew that the five-wheel waterwheel broke its axle!
    Two screws had their heads broken off,
    Unable to water, everyone was worried.
    The Forward Team members discussed it together:
    "This time in the competition, we're going to fall behind!"
    Let's not talk about how anxious everyone was,
    Let's talk about Shen Laoliu, the vice-captain of the Forward Team.
    He's a good hand at hard work,
    But his temper is as violent as a bull.
    He was so anxious that he couldn't sleep or dream,
    Like a kite with a broken string, floating in the air.
    After dinner, he pushed his bowl away and went out,
    Rushed to the commune factory in one breath.
    As soon as he entered the factory, he happened to meet the Party branch secretary,
    Who warmly received Shen Laoliu.
    He first explained that the workers had all gone to the countryside,
    Making an iron axle would probably take a day or two.
    Our factory will try its best to find a solution,
    To support your production team in winning a bumper harvest.
    Shen Laoliu was secretly angry when he heard this,
    Stomped his feet and turned to leave.
    He secretly complained that the factory wasn't leaping forward,
    How could he wait two days!
    He walked quickly, thinking about it,
    Before long, he came to the plot of land with the broken waterwheel.
    In the moonlight, he saw the radish leaves wilting from drought,
    And the millet drooping from thirst,
    The corn stalks falling in the wind,
    Dry land cracked with gullies.
    The more he looked, the more anxious he felt,
    Squatted on the edge of the field, even more worried.
    Just as Shen Laoliu was in trouble,
    Suddenly, he heard a thumping sound from the well of the waterwheel.
    In the moonlight, he saw two men and a girl standing on the well platform.
    He bent his waist and rushed forward,
    Came to the well and shouted:
    "Where did these bold thieves come from,
    Daring to steal the commune's waterwheel in the middle of the night!"
    The men didn't answer,
    The girl quickly spoke up:
    "Uncle Laoliu, don't be afraid,
    It's me, Yumei, the branch secretary, and Baoniu."
    Shen Laoliu listened carefully and replied:
    Indeed, it was the three of them at the well.
    Baoniu was carrying a small iron hammer,
    Little Yumei was holding a wrench, sweating profusely,
    Secretary Li was dismantling the waterwheel,
    Various parts were scattered on the ground.
    He saw clearly and was even more angry,
    They shouldn't steal his beloved waterwheel.
    Even though the waterwheel axle was broken,
    They shouldn't dismantle it and treat it as scrap iron for research.
    Shen Laoliu raised his hand to grab it back,
    Secretary Li quickly stopped him.
    Why didn't Laoliu ask clearly before getting angry?
    There's a reason for it.
    A few days ago, there was a technical innovation in the village,
    Baoniu and Yumei took the lead.
    Baoniu is a versatile person in the Red Flag Team,
    Little Yumei is a clever girl in the Forward Team.
    The two of them reformed new tools,
    Set up a blacksmith's furnace and studied carefully.
    Everyone said: They are a pair of red people who dare to think and dare to do,
    Some people also said that they were making up nonsense for romance.
    Yumei is Shen Laoliu's niece,
    One day, she went to her uncle to ask for scrap iron.
    Shen Laoliu was annoyed when he heard about finding iron,
    Said they were delaying production and not putting in work.
    Today, seeing them dismantling the waterwheel again,
    Shen Laoliu was even more furious.
    Just as he was about to grab the axle,
    Secretary Li smiled slightly and asked Laoliu:
    "Why are you so angry?"
    Laoliu said: "Because they are dismantling my waterwheel to steal iron!"
    Secretary Li said: "They didn't come to steal iron,
    They are helping you repair the waterwheel."
    Laoliu said: "Our team is competing with their team,
    To win the red flag and become rivals,
    Everyone is striving to be in the lead,
    How can they help us repair the waterwheel?"
    Yumei said: "Competition is for mutual encouragement,"
    Baoniu said: "Repairing the waterwheel is for a bumper harvest,
    We are helping and competing with great collaboration,
    Don't turn good intentions into enemies!"
    Shen Laoliu was half-believing and half-doubting, silent,
    The three of them hurried to work again.
    A blacksmith's furnace was set up on the well platform,
    The furnace fire was burning red,
    Baoniu held the tongs, recognizing the fire's nature,
    Yumei swung the hammer skillfully.
    The two screw caps were screwed on,
    The waterwheel axle was connected in an instant.
    The five-wheel waterwheel was quickly installed,
    The three of them pushed and clear water flowed.
    Shen Laoliu was about to step forward to admit his mistake,
    He only felt his face burning and ashamed inside.
    At this time, the east was dawning and the gongs and drums were sounding,
    And the factory workers came to deliver the waterwheel axle.
    The Party branch secretary of the factory walked in front,
    The workers beat gongs and drums, carrying the waterwheel axle that had been made overnight.
    Shen Laoliu's eyes were filled with tears of excitement,
    Hurriedly bent down and nodded repeatedly,
    Ran up to thank the comrades of the factory for their help,
    And praised the courageous and capable Yumei and Baoniu.
    He turned back to Secretary Li and made a self-criticism:
    "My Laoliu is short-sighted and too conservative.
    From now on, I'm determined to change,
    Learn from everyone and not fall behind."
    This is a segment about everyone working for agricultural harvest,
    Singing here is a pause.

    水车轴（山东快书）	张君
    只因为保证农业大丰收，
    有件事出在俺社里头。
    俺公社有个红旗生产队，
    它与那前进队竞赛是对手。
    两个队越赛越鼓劲，
    都想得红旗占上游。
    种萝卜力争大丰产，
    谷子、玉米更要加倍再出头！
    红旗队社员吃住在阵地，
    前进队男女老少更加油，
    头一遍锄草搞的好，
    二一遍施肥管理真讲究。
    眼看正该浇大水，
    谁知道五轮水车拆了轴！
    有两个螺丝掉了帽，
    不能浇水人人愁。
    前进队社员齐议论：
    “这一回竞赛咱要落了后！”
    且不言大家正着急，
    说一说前进队副队长申老六。
    论干活力大是把好手，
    可就是脾气暴躁如莽牛，
    急的他睡思梦想心不安，
    就像那风筝断线空中游。
    晚饭后把碗一推往外走，
    一口气跑到公社工厂里头。
    一进厂巧遇党支书，
    热心接待了申老六。
    先说明工人们齐下了乡，
    制铁轴恐怕得要一两天后，
    咱工厂尽量想办法，
    支援你们生产队夺丰收。
    申老六一听暗生气，
    把脚一跺回头走。
    暗埋怨工厂不跃进，
    怎能等待两天以后！
    他思思念念走的快，
    不多时来在坏水车的那块地头。
    月光下只见萝卜旱的软了叶，
    又旱的谷子低着头，
    旱的玉米随风倒，
    干地裂了一道道沟。
    他越看越觉得心焦乱，
    蹲在了地边上愁更愁。
    申老六正在为难际，
    忽听得水车井上一阵咚当响，
    月光下看见井台上站着两个男人一个丫头。
    他施个弯腰往前闯，
    来在井边一声吼：
    “哪来的贼子好大胆，
    半夜敢把公社的水车偷！”
    男子们听了没答话，
    那女子听罢喊声忙开口：
    “老六叔你别害怕，
    俺是玉梅、支书和宝牛。”
    申老六听罢答话仔细看：
    果然是他们三人在井头。
    那宝牛手提小铁锤，
    小玉梅手拿扳子汗直流，
    李支书正在拆水车，
    各种零件地上丢。
    他看的明白心更恼，
    不该把咱心爱的水车偷，
    虽说是坏了水车轴，
    也不该拆坏当成废铁去研究。
    申老六举手往回抢，
    李支书急忙拦住他的手。
    为什么老六不问清楚就上火？
    有个缘故在里头。
    前些日村里技术闹革新，
    宝牛、玉梅起带头，
    那宝牛是红旗队里多面手，
    小玉梅是前进队里巧妞妞。
    他二人改革新工具，
    安起了铁匠炉子仔细研究。
    大伙说：他们是敢想敢干一对红人，
    也有人说他俩是为搞恋爱瞎胡诌。
    玉梅是申老六的亲侄女，
    有一天找废铁去把她叔父求。
    申老六听说找铁心中恼，
    说他们耽误生产不把工投。
    今天又见拆水车，
    申老六更是气牛斗。
    他正要动手抢车轴，
    李支书微微一笑问老六：
    “你为什么火气大？”
    老六说：“因为他们拆我水车当铁偷！”
    李支书说：“他们不是来偷铁，
    他们帮你把水车修。”
    老六说：“俺队跟他队搞竞赛，
    为夺红旗成对手，
    大家全在争上游，
    他怎能帮俺把水车修？”
    玉梅说：“搞竞赛为的互相鼓励”，
    宝牛说：“修水车为的大丰收，
    俺这是又帮又赛大协作，
    可别把好意反为仇！”
    申老六半信半疑不言语，
    他们三人急急忙忙又动手。
    井台上安起铁匠炉，
    生起炉火红溜溜，
    宝牛掌钳认火性，
    玉梅抡锤真顺手。
    旋好两个螺丝帽，
    霎时接好水车轴。
    五轮水车忙安起，
    三人一推清水流。
    申老六才要上前去认错，
    只觉得满脸发烧心内羞。
    这时候东方发亮锣鼓响，
    又来了工厂工人来送水车轴。
    工厂的党支书头前走，
    工人们敲着锣鼓抬着连夜赶制的水车轴。
    申老六激动的两眼出泪花，
    急忙忙弯身乱点头，
    跑上去谢工厂同志来帮助，
    又赞扬敢想敢干的玉梅和宝牛。
    忙回头向李支书作检讨：
    “我老六眼光短浅太守旧。
    从今后下定决心改，
    向大家学习不落后。”
    这就是人人为农业丰收一个段，
    唱到这里算一扣。
