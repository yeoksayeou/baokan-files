《Twelve Muqam》: Withered Trees Revive in Spring
Wan Tongshu

The Xinjiang Uyghur people love music and dance. Everyone can sing and dance, and they have always been known as the "home of song and dance." The folk music that is passed down is rich and colorful in content and style, and diverse in form. Among them, there is a set of classical music called "Twelve Muqam" (meaning twelve major suites), which occupies an important position in folk music. Anyone who has been to Xinjiang, in the vast area north and south of the Tianshan Mountains, can see people singing some of the beautiful melodies from the "Twelve Muqam" everywhere. During grand festivals, in the crowded bazaars (markets), you can often see people singing and dancing to the Muqam melodies played on various instruments such as the Satar, Tambur, Dutar, and hand drums. When farmers celebrate the harvest, or during the Meshrep held for weddings, the performance of Muqam adds even more to their joy. The "Twelve Muqam" is closely linked to the lives of the people. Everyone loves it and calls it the "Mother of Uyghur Music."

The "Twelve Muqam" is a huge musical treasure created by the Uyghur working people over a long period of time based on their arduous struggle and life experiences, and with their genius for musical wisdom. It vividly reflects the working people's indignation towards the dark feudal ruling forces in history, and their ardent desire for a bright and happy life through vivid musical images and musical language. Because it is produced on the basis of national folk traditional music and art forms, it has a bright folk melody and a strong national style. Moreover, it absorbs the excellent music of other ethnic groups and enriches itself. From these music, we can see the far-reaching influence between Han Chinese music and Uyghur music, which shows the close relationship between the Han Chinese people and the Uyghur people in cultural exchange and development throughout history.

The "Twelve Muqam" (referred to as the Grand Suite) brings together various excellent folk music and art forms and some classical music, and organically combines them according to a certain ideological development logic to form a systematic and complete structural form. It is a highly concentrated and highly developed result of the excellent traditional music and art forms of the Uyghur people. It is divided into twelve suites, each of which is divided into three parts: Da Lakman, Dastan, and Meshrep. The entire "Twelve Muqam" includes more than one hundred and seventy tunes and seventy-two pieces of music. It takes more than twenty hours to sing it all from beginning to end.

The Grand Suite includes many excellent folk songs. These folk songs vividly reflect the thoughts, feelings, and lives of the working people in history with very simple and vivid musical language. For example, one of the songs, "Saynam," sings:

	I am the song of the motherland,
	Like a swan flying in the wilderness,
	As long as I can get my wish,
	I would be willing to die.
	Pebbles on the river beach, you can’t pick them all with a branch.
	When suffering comes, tears cannot be dried.
	Flying a kite everywhere,
	Which garden haven't my lover and I lingered in?
	Years have passed in the blink of an eye,
	The bitterness in my heart has turned into blood.

Some dance songs and dance music in the Grand Suite have lively rhythms, vivid images, and enthusiastic and excited emotions. The music is full of the Uyghur people's optimistic spirit of loving life.

Another genre and style, the Dastan (narrative suite), is formed by combining various folk narrative songs with different tones and emotions. These beautiful, smooth, and easy-to-understand songs generally sing about some folk legends: such as the protagonists in the stories of Alip and Saynam, Laili and Majnun, who are all heroes who pursue a happy life and fight unyielding against feudal forces. They are deeply loved and sympathized with by the masses. Because it conforms to the people's life ideals, the narrative suite is a folk music form that is loved by the broad masses of people and never tires of listening to.

In addition, there are some classical songs in the Grand Suite, some of which contain progressive ideological tendencies. They reflect the author's dissatisfaction with the dark rulers and sympathy for the people's lives. For example, the prelude to "Rak Muqam" sings:

	The hardships of time make us thin and old,
	Beauty and strength, ask those who are possessing youth
	men and women.
	The taste of loneliness, rich and powerful people don’t understand,
	The bitterness of poverty is best understood by wanderers.
	The plight of the weak - lovers can only wait for death
	coming,
	Who can pass the sentence of death? It’s the tyrannical tyrant.
	Friends! Navayi lives in the desert of love,
	To know him, ask the traveling group from there.

Although this type of music had a certain progressive significance in the feudal society of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, due to the author's class limitations and the historical era in which he lived, he often treated reality with reformist fantasies. He could not effectively promote social development, and he could not completely solve the contradictions of social class opposition. This fragile ideology is manifested in the music with lingering melodies, obscure emotions, and more or less a pessimistic and gloomy tone. It cannot be compared with the clear class feelings and strong spirit of struggle in folk songs. There is a fundamental class difference in ideology between the two.

The above is only a very brief overview of the musical content of the Grand Suite. Although there is some classical music in it, and even some individual unhealthy songs, from the overall ideological content, complete structural form, and rich melody of the Grand Suite, it is an excellent music with clear people's character, and a precious musical heritage of the motherland. In the past, the "Twelve Muqam" has always been passed down orally among the people. In addition, it has been ravaged by feudal forces throughout history, so fewer and fewer people are singing it, gradually stagnating and declining, and almost becoming extinct. Before liberation, only a few elderly artists could sing it relatively completely.

After liberation, in order to preserve this musical heritage, the Party organized manpower and material resources to collect and organize it. Organizing such a large set of national musical heritage is an arduous and complex task. In the work, the Party always gave cordial care and guidance to the work, organized relevant units and individuals to discuss and study the collation plan, organized forces from all aspects to vigorously support, and solved the difficulties of insufficient manpower and technical equipment in the work, and constantly encouraged and strengthened the comrades' work enthusiasm; this musical heritage, which was about to be lost, was finally rescued under the leadership and attention of the Party after five years.

In the past few years, the Grand Suite has undergone unprecedented new developments. It has greatly expanded the scope of activities. Now, beautiful Muqam melodies can often be heard on the stage and on the radio. In Urumqi, Kashgar, Yining, Hotan, and even in more remote rural areas, there are many young musicians learning this heritage from old artists. What is even more gratifying is that many professional and amateur music groups have absorbed the excellent music from the Grand Suite and created and adapted works in various forms. These works profoundly express the deep feelings of the people of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang for loving the Party and loving Chairman Mao, and express the happy and joyful working lives of the people of all ethnic groups.

Inheriting and developing Grand Suite music is just a beginning. It is not difficult to estimate that, under the guidance of the Party's policy of letting a hundred flowers bloom and bringing forth new ideas, the "Twelve Muqam" will surely emit its greater brilliance in the garden of socialist music and art.

    《十二木卡姆》枯木逢春
    万桐书
    新疆维吾尔族人民热爱音乐舞蹈，人人能歌善舞，历来就有“歌舞之乡”的称号。流传在民间的音乐，内容、格调丰富多彩，体裁形式多种多样。其中，有一套古典音乐《十二木卡姆》（意即十二部大曲），它在民间音乐中占有重要的位置。凡是到过新疆的人，在天山南北广阔的地区，到处都可以见到人们歌唱着《十二木卡姆》中一些动听的曲调。遇到盛大的节日，在人山人海的巴札（集市）上，常常可以看到人们随着沙塔尔、弹拨尔、独他、手鼓等各种乐器演奏的木卡姆曲调载歌载舞。农民们庆祝丰收时，或是在举行婚礼的麦西热普中，木卡姆的演唱更能增加他们的欢乐。《十二木卡姆》紧密地与人民的生活联系在一起，大家喜爱它，称它是“维吾尔音乐之母”。
    《十二木卡姆》是维吾尔族劳动人民长时期以来，根据自己艰苦的斗争生活经历，以天才的音乐智慧创作出来的一部巨大的音乐财富。它以生动的音乐形象和音乐语言，鲜明地反映了劳动人民对历史上黑暗封建统治势力的愤慨情绪，和热烈追求光明幸福的愿望。由于它产生在民族民间传统音乐艺术形式的基础上，因此它又具有明快的民间音调和浓厚的民族风格色采。而且，它吸收了其它民族的优秀音乐，丰富了自己。从这些音乐可以看出，汉族音乐和维吾尔族音乐相互间的深远的影响，它说明历来汉族人民和维吾尔族人民在文化交流发展中的亲密关系。
    《十二木卡姆》（简称大曲）汇集了民间各种优秀的音乐艺术形式和部分古典音乐，按一定的思想发展逻辑有机地组合在一起，形成系统的完整的结构形式。它是维吾尔族优秀传统音乐艺术形式的高度集中，高度发展的结果。它共分十二套，每套又分大拉克曼、达斯坦和麦西热普三部分，全部《十二木卡姆》共包括一百七十多首曲牌和七十二首乐曲，如果从始至终演唱一遍需要二十多个小时。
    大曲中包罗有许多优秀的民歌，这些民歌以非常朴实、生动的音乐语言，鲜明地反映了历史上劳动人民的思想感情和生活，如其中的一首《赛乃姆》唱道：
    我是祖国的歌声，
    像天鹅飞翔在原野上，
    只要我能如愿，
    就是死也心甘。
    河滩的石子，一根?枝挑不完。
    痛苦来到，眼泪擦不干。
    架着鹞子到处都走遍，
    哪一座花园我和爱人没有流连？
    转眼间又过了几年，
    心里的苦水变成血浆。
    大曲中的一些舞蹈歌曲和舞蹈乐曲，都具有活泼的节奏，生动的形象和热烈兴奋的情绪，音乐中充满了维吾尔族人民热爱生活的乐观精神。
    另一体裁、风格的达斯坦（叙事组歌），是各种不同音调、情绪的民间叙事歌组合在一起形成的。这些优美流畅易懂的歌曲，一般都是演唱一些民间传说故事：如艾里甫与赛乃姆、莱丽·麦吉弄等故事中的主人公都是追求幸福生活与封建势力作不屈斗争的英雄。他们深受群众的喜爱和同情。由于它符合人民的生活理想，因此，叙事组歌是广大群众所喜闻乐见、百听不厌的民间音乐形式。
    另外，在大曲中还有些古典歌曲，其中有些带有进步思想倾向的作品，它反映了作者对黑暗统治者的不满，同情人民的生活遭遇。如《拉克木卡姆》散序唱道：
    时间的辛劳使我们消瘦又苍老，
    美丽和力量，问那些正在拥有青春的
      男女。
    孤独的滋味，富贵有权的人不懂，
    穷困的苦楚，流浪者了解得最深。
    弱者的处境——爱侣们只有等待死亡
      来临，
    谁能下死亡的判决？是那残横的暴君。
    朋友们！那瓦依生活在爱的戈壁里，
    要知道他，去问从那里来的旅群。
    这类音乐，在十六、十七世纪封建社会中虽然有它一定的进步意义，但是由于作者的阶级局限性和他所处的历史时代，他常常是以改良主义的幻想来对待现实，他不可能有力地促进社会的发展，更不可能彻底解决社会阶级对立的矛盾。这种脆弱的思想性表现在音乐上是曲调缠绵，感情隐晦，还或多或少带有些悲观阴郁的色调。它与民歌鲜明的阶级感情、坚强的生活斗争精神不能比拟，两者之间在思想性上有着根本的阶级区别。
    以上仅只是大曲音乐内容非常简略的概况，尽管它里面有些古典音乐，甚至有个别不健康的歌曲，但是，从大曲总的思想内容，完整的结构形式和丰富的曲调来看，它是一部具有鲜明人民性的优秀音乐，是祖国一部珍贵的音乐遗产。以往《十二木卡姆》一直口头传授流传在民间，加以历来遭到封建势力的摧残，所以演唱它的人越来越少，逐渐停滞衰颓，几乎失传。解放前，只有个别高龄艺人能够比较完整地演唱出来。
    解放后，党为了保留这套音乐遗产，组织了人力物力进行搜集整理。整理这样大套的民族音乐遗产，是一件艰巨而又复杂的工作，在思想上方法上技术上遇到不少的问题。工作中，党随时对工作给予亲切的关怀和指导，组织有关的单位和个人讨论研究整理方案，组织各方面的力量大力支援，解决工作上人力、技术设备不足的困难，不断鼓舞坚定同志们的工作热情；这套即将失传的音乐遗产，在党的领导和重视下，经过五年的时间，终究被抢救出来了。
    几年来，大曲有了史无前例的新发展，它大大地扩大了活动的范围，现在在舞台上、广播里经常能听到木卡姆优美的曲调，在乌鲁木齐、喀什、伊宁、和田直到较边远的农村，有许许多多青年音乐工作者，向老艺人们学习这套遗产。更令人可喜的是，许多专业音乐团体和业余音乐团体吸取了大曲中优秀的音乐，创作改编了各种形式的作品。这些作品深刻地表现了新疆各族人民热爱党热爱毛主席的深厚感情，表现了各族人民幸福愉快的劳动生活。
    继承与发展大曲音乐，这仅仅只是一个开端，不难估计，《十二木卡姆》在党的百花齐放，推陈出新方针指导下，在社会主义音乐艺术的百花园中，必将发射它更大的光辉。
