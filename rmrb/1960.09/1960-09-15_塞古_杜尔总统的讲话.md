Xinhua News Agency, September 14th: The full text of President Sékou Touré's speech at Beijing Airport is as follows:
　　Mr. President of the Republic, dear friends, ministers, excellencies, ladies and gentlemen:
　　As the delegation of the Republic of Guinea is about to depart, we would first like to express our sincerest gratitude to the Chinese government, the leaders of the Chinese people, and the entire Chinese people. At the same time, we would like to assure that the government and people of Guinea are willing to engage in sincere cooperation to concretely realize the results of our talks in Beijing. Indeed, our stay has been brief, but it has been delightfully filled with fruitful discussions in which various important issues of concern to humanity, and particularly to the people of our two countries, have been discussed. We note that these talks have been friendly, cordial, and sincere, and we therefore believe that the goals set for our joint action—goals that belong to the most humane and progressive ideals of our world—will make a decisive contribution to establishing, expanding, and consolidating the foundations of world peace.
　　We have also specifically demonstrated that relations between nations should be built on the basis of equality, with the aim of enabling all nations to contribute to the progress and peace of the world. The Guinean government delegation is very satisfied with the mission it has accomplished in visiting the Chinese government and people. The Guinean government delegation has been deeply and indelibly impressed by the large-scale mass rallies from the moment of its arrival until its departure, which demonstrate the vitality of the Chinese people and also express the trust and respect of the Chinese people for the people of African countries and the people of all countries in the world. We will convey your friendship to the people of African countries in clear and truthful language, and the people of African countries will not only be proud of this, but also sincerely grateful. They will also demonstrate to the Chinese people through concrete actions that they harbor the same friendship, trust, and desire for fraternal cooperation.
　　Before departing, we would also like to thank the distinguished representatives of the various countries of the world who are represented in Beijing and who have participated in many gatherings, which is also a symbol of international friendship. Guinea's deep hope is to contribute to the consolidation of this friendship. We thank the youth and workers of China, this vibrant force that is dedicated to building this country and changing its face. We know that the strength formed by the mass enthusiasm, absolute unity, confidence, and will of the Chinese people in socialist construction is unshakable by any other force. We are not only with you in the struggle against imperialism and for the freedom of all peoples, but we also, like you, do not allow freedom to be plundered by a few exploiters to the detriment of the working people. We have our own view of the function of exercising independence and people's sovereignty, which is that everything should come from the people and for the people. This democratic and progressive essence of your policy is appreciated by our delegation, because the Guinean people are prepared to fully exercise their sovereignty and freely use various means to establish an economy that can satisfy everyone in equality, and by ensuring that all people and every citizen enjoy the same freedom, security, and equality, culture can be developed.
　　We express our gratitude to all the distinguished individuals who have shown us their trust, and we say that when we return to Africa, we will show you in a more concrete way what lessons we have learned from our stay in Beijing, and how much the Guinean people value the friendship with the Chinese people.
　　May the cooperation already established between our two countries develop,
　　May the just demand of all peoples—peace—be realized and consolidated,
　　May our talks and the actions to which they will lead make a decisive contribution to the realization of our common aspirations.

    塞古·杜尔总统的讲话
    新华社14日讯　塞古·杜尔总统在北京机场上的讲话，全文如下：共和国主席阁下，亲爱的朋友们部长们，各位大使阁下，女士们，先生们：
    在几内亚共和国政府代表团离开之际，我们首先要向中国政府、中国人民的各位领导人和全体中国人民致以最真诚的感谢，我们同时要保证几内亚政府和人民愿意进行忠诚的合作，以具体实现我们在北京会谈的结果。诚然，我们的逗留为期短促，但它令人可喜地充满了有成果的会谈，在这些会谈中讨论了目前使人类、特别是使我们两国人民感到关切的各种重要问题。我们注意到这些会谈是友好、亲切和诚挚的，因此我们认为，为我们的共同行动所规定的目标——属于我们世界最人道、最进步的理想的这种目标，对建立、扩大和巩固世界和平的基础，将成为一种决定性的贡献。
    我们同时具体证明了各国人民的关系应该建立在平等的基础上，其目的在于使各国人民为全世界进步与和平作出贡献。几内亚政府代表团对于它访问中国政府和人民所完成的使命感到十分满意。几内亚政府代表团对从它一到达直至离开的大规模的群众集会留下了深刻和难忘的印象，这些集会显示了中国人民生气勃勃，同时还表达了中国人民对非洲各国人民以及世界各国人民的信任和尊重。我们将用清楚和真实的语言向非洲各国人民转达你们的友情，非洲各国人民将不仅为此感到骄傲，而且也会感到真诚的感激。他们也将用具体行动向中国人民表明，他们抱有同样的友情、信任和兄弟合作的意愿。
    我们在动身以前还要感谢在北京有代表的世界不同国家的高贵的代表们，他们参加了许多集会，这也是国际友谊的标志，几内亚的深切希望就是能有助于这种友谊的巩固。我们感谢中国的青年和劳动者，这支有生气的力量正致力于建设这个国家和改变它的面貌。我们知道中国人民在社会主义建设中的群众热情、绝对的团结、信心和意志所形成的力量是任何其他力量都不可动摇的。我们不仅在反对帝国主义和争取各国人民自由的斗争中同你们在一起，我们还和你们同样地不允许自由为少数剥削者所掠夺而不利于劳动人民。我们对于行使独立和人民主权的职能是有自己的看法的，即是一切都应该来自人民和为了人民。你们政策的这一民主和进步实质为我们代表团所赞赏，因为几内亚人民准备充分行使自己的主权，自由地运用各种手段来建立一种经济，它可以在平等中使一切人感到满足，并通过确保全国人民和每一公民享有同样的自由、安全和平等的条件下，使文化得以发展。
    我们向一切对我们表示信任的著名人士表示感激，我们说，我们回到非洲后将以更具体的方法向你们表明我们从在北京的逗留中得到了哪些教益，和几内亚人民对中国人民的友谊有多大的价值。
    祝我们两国之间已经建立起来的合作得到发展，
    祝各国人民一致的正当要求——和平，能够实现并得到巩固，
    祝我们的会谈和会谈将导致的行动，能对实现我们的共同愿望做出决定性的贡献。
