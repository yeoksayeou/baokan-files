Our newspaper Zhengzhou, 28th dispatch: Henan Province's new cotton purchase volume is rapidly increasing. In the seven days from the 8th to the 14th, the province's purchase of seed cotton increased by 3.4 times compared to the previous seven days.

This year, Henan Province's cotton pest control and fertilizer application were timely, and management was meticulous, generally resulting in good growth. In order to sell cotton to the state early, all people's communes have taken measures to strengthen labor for picking, sorting, drying, and selling. According to the spirit of centralized picking, centralized processing, and centralized purchasing, commercial departments in various regions made early preparations for the peak season purchasing work, and successively established 4,000 purchasing stations and fixed purchasing points in various cotton-producing areas to facilitate the communes' sales. Approximately 80% of the sawtooth cotton gins, lint cleaners, baling machines, and power machinery in the province's cotton processing plants have been overhauled.

Our newspaper Nanjing, 28th dispatch: Cotton in the cotton-producing areas of Jiangsu Province has begun to fluff, and members of the people's communes in various regions are picking new cotton in the cotton fields and selling it promptly.

Various regions have strengthened leadership in the picking and selling of new cotton. Huaiyin, Haimen, Dongtai, and other counties and cities have organized dedicated leadership lines from top to bottom to effectively direct rapid picking and selling. Various regions have also established professional teams for picking cotton, storage, and transportation, focusing on action, picking, drying, and selling as soon as ripe.

In order to adapt to the new situation of this year's cotton purchasing work, the province has established more than 1,500 cotton receiving stations, equipped with more than 5,000 full-time purchasing agents. At the same time, the province has centrally trained 2,000 cotton receiving cadres in sixteen areas, and 13,600 boxes of imitation cotton grade standards have been issued to cotton receiving stations.

Our newspaper Jinan, 28th dispatch: People's communes in Shandong actively sell new cotton.

In order to sell new cotton to the state quickly and centrally, and support national construction, the people's communes generally implemented centralized picking, centralized drying, and centralized selling; picking, drying, and selling as soon as harvested. In the Lincheng, Guanxian, and Xiazhen concentration production areas of Liaocheng Prefecture, from counties and cities to communes and brigades, the secretaries took the lead and absorbed responsible comrades from relevant departments such as finance and trade, commerce, and banking to form cotton picking and purchasing headquarters or leading groups. In order to ensure that cotton picking, cotton transportation, and other agricultural tasks were not delayed, the communities and teams in these counties made reasonable arrangements in terms of labor and transportation. Generally, 40% to 60% of women's labor and most of the semi-labor force were organized into professional cotton picking teams. Each production team fixed two to three small rubber-wheeled carts or one large cart to transport and deliver cotton, achieving picking, drying, and delivering as soon as harvested.

In order to adapt to the form of centralized picking and centralized selling of communities and teams, commercial departments in various regions adopted a combination of fixed and mobile purchasing, and a combination of fixed-point and in-depth field purchasing. More than 1,000 commercial staff in Xiazhen and Linqing went deep into the concentrated cotton-producing communities and teams and fields to organize members to pick cotton on one hand, and grade it on the spot, weigh it on the spot, and pay on the spot on the other hand, implementing evaluation and pricing by combining purchasing personnel with the masses, achieving reasonable prices, and being deeply welcomed by the masses.

Our newspaper Hangzhou, 28th dispatch: Cotton purchasing work in Zhejiang Province has generally begun. As of the 15th, the province has purchased more than 100,000 dan of new cotton, an increase of 1.47 times over the same period last year, and the quality of the new cotton has also improved compared with last year.

This year, cotton growth in Zhejiang is generally good. All regions take the contracted production teams as units, establish professional teams, and adopt methods of centralized harvesting, centralized sorting and drying, centralized storage, centralized processing, and centralized delivery and sales, strictly implementing grading, picking, sorting, drying, storing, and selling to ensure fast harvesting and selling, and good harvesting and selling.

In the purchasing work, commercial employees in various regions have tried their best to improve purchasing methods and facilitate the sales of people's communes. Cixi, Haining, Yongkang, and other counties accelerated the purchasing progress by arranging tasks, arranging labor, and drawing more than 700 people from the commercial sector and its affiliated county and community industries to enrich the grassroots purchasing force. The province's twenty-three key cotton processing plants have basically realized the automation of cotton ginning and flower feeding, the mechanization and electrification of baling through vigorous technological innovation, and have established ten continuous production lines. Therefore, more than 2,200 people have been saved, ensuring the needs of purchasing and processing. (Attached picture)
