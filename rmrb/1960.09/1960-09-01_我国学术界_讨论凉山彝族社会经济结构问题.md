China's academic circles are discussing the pre-capitalist social system of the Yi people in the Liangshan area. After liberation, through democratic reforms and socialist transformation, it has been thoroughly overthrown by the Yi people. However, there are still different views in China's academic circles regarding the socio-economic structure of the Yi people in the Liangshan area before liberation. Based on an analysis of currently published articles on the socio-economic structure of the Yi people, these views can be roughly summarized into the following three types. The first view is that it was a slave system or basically a slave system (such as Hu Qingjun's articles in *Teaching and Research*, combined issues 8 and 9 of 1956 and issue 1 of 1957, and Xia Kangnong et al.'s articles in *Ethnic Studies*, issue 1 of 1958); the second view is that it was an early feudal system or basically a feudal system (such as Zhang Feng's article in *Yunnan University Journal*, issue 3 of 1958, and Jiang Yingliang's article in issue 1 of the same year); the third view is that it was in a stage of transition from slavery to feudalism (such as Shi Xiulin and Chen Jiyuan's article in *Ethnic Studies*, issue 9 of 1959). *Ethnic Studies* published two articles by Liang Shan and Chen Kewei in the sixth issue of 1960. They believe that the socio-economic structure of the Liangshan Yi people was slavery and criticized the arguments of Shi Xiulin and Chen Jiyuan. The editors of *Ethnic Studies* added an editor's note when publishing these two articles, hoping that everyone would continue to discuss this issue.

The main point of contention among the above three views lies in the understanding of the Yi society's relations of production and class relations. This mainly includes the following two issues: 1. the nature of tenancy relations; 2. the class nature of Qunuo and Ajia.

In addition to direct personal forced exploitation, land rent exploitation was also prevalent in Liangshan Yi society. Proponents of the "slave system" believe that tenancy relations should be linked to the slave system and regard tenancy relations as an auxiliary factor of the slave system. Proponents of the "feudal system" and "transitional stage" believe that tenancy relations should be linked to the feudal system, because the feudal system is "characterized by land rent exploitation."

Among the four classes of Liangshan Yi society, in addition to the undisputed status of Jiaxi, a single slave with nothing, there are also obvious differences in the understanding of the class nature of Qunuo and Ajia, which affects the affirmation of the class nature of the Hei Yi (Black Yi) class. Proponents of the "slave system" believe that Ajia are still in a slave status, Qunuo are farmers subordinate to the Hei Yi, or similar to protected people under the slave system, while Hei Yi are slave owners. Proponents of the "feudal system" and "transitional stage" believe that Ajia are equivalent to serfs in the transition period from slavery to feudalism, Qunuo are equivalent to serfs or feudal peasants under the feudal system, and Hei Yi are feudal lords or slave owners and feudal lords. It can be seen that on some of the above major issues, proponents of the feudal system and the transitional stage have common or basically consistent views, but proponents of the "transitional stage" do not recognize that feudal relations of production have occupied a dominant position in Liangshan, but believe that slavery and feudalism coexist, and the two are in a process of mutual alternation and ebb and flow.

In addition to the above main issues, there are also different views on the following issues. (1) Regarding the estimation of the level of productive forces of the Liangshan Yi people: Proponents of the "slave system" believe that the level of productive forces of the Yi people is extremely low; proponents of the "feudal system" believe that it is no lower than that of the Han areas; proponents of the "transitional stage" believe that it is neither extremely low nor as high as that of the Han areas. (2) Regarding the impact of the Han feudal system on the Yi society: Proponents of the "slave system" acknowledge that the Han feudal system had a certain impact on the Yi society, but this impact did not fundamentally change the nature of the Yi society; proponents of the "feudal system" believe that under the continuous influence of the advanced production methods of the Han people, the Liangshan Yi society has been transformed into a feudal system. (3) Regarding the significance of the proportion of each class in the total population of the Yi people in affirming the nature of the Yi society: Proponents of the "slave system" believe that although Ajia and Jiaxi, who are in a slave status, only account for 38% of the total population of the Yi people, it cannot be mechanically concluded that the Yi society is not of the nature of a slave system. Proponents of the "feudal system" and the "transitional stage" believe that only Jiaxi can be confirmed as slaves, and Jiaxi only account for 8% of the total population, therefore it cannot be confirmed that the Yi society is a slave system.

    我国学术界
    讨论凉山彝族社会经济结构问题
    凉山地区彝族的前资本主义的社会制度，在解放以后，经过民主改革和社会主义改造，已经被彝族人民彻底推翻了。但是，对于解放以前凉山地区彝族的社会经济结构，我国学术界还存在着不同的看法。根据目前已发表的有关彝族社会经济结构的文章分析，这些看法大体上可以归纳为以下三种。第一种意见认为，它是奴隶制或基本上是奴隶制（如《教学研究》1956年八、九合期和1957年第一期胡庆钧的文章，《民族研究》1958年第一期夏康农等的文章）；第二种意见认为，它是封建制初期或基本上是封建制（如《云南大学学报》1958年第三期章峰的文章和同年第一期江应梁的文章）；第三种意见认为，它正处在由奴隶制向封建制过渡的阶段（如《民族研究》1959年第九期施修霖和陈吉元的文章）。《民族研究》1960年第六期刊登了梁山和陈可畏的两篇文章。他们认为凉山彝族社会经济结构是奴隶制，批驳了施修霖和陈吉元的论点。《民族研究》的编者在发表这两篇文章时加了按语，希望大家就这一问题继续展开讨论。
    上述三种主张的主要争执点，在于对彝族社会生产关系和阶级关系的理解。这里面主要包括以下两个问题：一、租佃关系性质的问题；二、曲诺和阿加的阶级性质的问题。
    凉山彝族社会除了直接占有人身的强制剥削以外，还普遍存在着地租剥削。“奴隶制”的主张者认为租佃关系应该和奴隶制度联系在一起，把租佃关系视为奴隶制的辅导因素。“封建制”和“过渡阶段”的主张者认为租佃关系应该和封建制度联系在一起，因为封建制度是以“地租剥削为特征”的。
    凉山彝族社会的四个等级中，除了对于呷西这个一无所有的单身奴隶没有争执以外，对于曲诺和阿加的阶级性质的理解，也存在着明显的分歧，并且由此影响到对黑彝等级性质的肯定。“奴隶制”的主张者认为，阿加仍然处在奴隶的地位，曲诺是黑彝奴役下的具有隶属关系的农民，或者类似于奴隶制度下的被保护民，而黑彝则是奴隶主。“封建制”和“过渡阶段”的主张者认为，阿加相当于奴隶制向封建制过渡时期的隶农，曲诺相当于封建制度下面的农奴或者封建农民的地位，黑彝则是封建主或者奴隶主兼封建主。由此可见，在上述一些主要问题上，封建制度和过渡阶段的主张者有着共同的或者基本上一致的看法，但是“过渡阶段”的主张者不承认封建制的生产关系在凉山已占居主导地位，而认为奴隶制和封建制同时并存，二者正在相互交替消长的过程中。
    除了对于上述主要问题存在分歧以外，在下面几个问题上也存在着不同的看法。（一）对于凉山彝族生产力水平的估计：“奴隶制”的主张者认为彝族生产力水平极为低下；“封建制”的主张者认为它不比汉族地区低；“过渡阶段”的主张者认为它既不是极为低下，但又没有汉族地区高。（二）对于彝族社会所受汉族封建制度影响的看法：“奴隶制”的主张者承认汉族封建制度对彝族社会曾经产生一定的影响，但是这种影响并没有从根本上改变彝族社会的性质；“封建制”的主张者认为在汉族先进生产方式的不断影响下，凉山彝族社会已经转为封建制度。（三）对于各等级人口在彝族总人口中所占的比例在肯定彝族社会性质上的意义的看法：“奴隶制”的主张者认为，处于奴隶地位的阿加和呷西虽然只占彝族总人口的38％，但是不能据此就机械地断定彝族社会不是奴隶制度的性质。“封建制”和“过渡阶段”的主张者认为，只有呷西才能肯定为奴隶，而呷西只占总人口的8％，因此不能据此肯定彝族社会是奴隶制度。
