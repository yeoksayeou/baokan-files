In the past eleven years, under the wise leadership of the Party, the Chinese people have achieved great victories in the socialist revolution and socialist construction; especially since 1958, under the brilliant guidance of the Party's General Line of going all out, aiming high, and achieving greater, faster, better, and more economical results in building socialism, we have achieved continuous great leaps forward in industrial and agricultural production. In order to liberate and develop social productive forces on a larger scale and at a higher speed, we first realized the people's communization in the rural areas across the country. The three magic weapons of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Commune are changing China's long-standing image of "poverty and blankness." Because China's drama workers have closely followed the Party in the past eleven years, using their art to serve the socialist revolution and socialist construction, the face of Chinese drama art has also been greatly changed. If the vast majority of Chinese drama workers were bourgeois democrats eleven years ago, and some even had strong feudal ideas, then today, eleven years later, a drama team with worker-class drama workers as its backbone has been formed and can serve workers, peasants, and soldiers with higher ideological awareness. If our dramas, especially traditional operas, still mixed unhealthy, supernatural, terrifying, and erotic elements from content to form eleven years ago, a mixture of pearls and mud, then today, eleven years later, Chinese dramas are bright and cheerful, full of pearls, although as new things, they are inevitably immature and rough, but the mud and dust have been washed away relatively cleanly. If Chinese drama eleven years ago was stagnating under the ravages and oppression of reactionary rule, unable to achieve due development; some were scarred and withered, declining day by day, then today, eleven years later, the number of opera genres has increased from 120 in 1952 to 470 today; the number of professional theaters has increased from 891 in 1949 to 2,800 in 1959; the number of employees in art performing groups has increased from 50,900 in 1949 to 260,000 in 1959; the number of art performing groups has increased from 1,000 in 1949 to 3,513 at the end of 1959. At present, there are 39,000 enterprise and institution amateur theater troupes, and more than 244,000 rural amateur theater troupes and cultural work troupes.

Such large-scale, high-speed, and high-quality development in just eleven years is only possible in a socialist country, and only under the wise leadership of the Party and Comrade Mao Zedong.

We will try to summarize the achievements and main experiences of the past eleven years into the following points:

Through industrialization, peasantization, labor reform, we have transformed and strengthened our ranks

The Party has given great care and love to drama workers, especially the vast number of artists. After the founding of the People's Republic, it not only greatly improved the social status of artists, but also adopted many thorough measures and patient steps to transform old artists and the vast number of drama workers. Over the past eleven years, drama workers have participated in various political movements and regular political and ideological studies. Especially after the rectification campaign in 1957, drama teams went to the mountains, the countryside, factories, companies, and the front lines in batches, closely integrated with workers, peasants, and soldiers, often participating in production labor while performing, and loyally and enthusiastically dedicated their best art to the masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers. The scale and depth of impact of this has never been seen before. This greatly encouraged the production enthusiasm of the working class and peasant laboring masses and the fighting spirit of commanders and fighters of the armed forces. Drama workers themselves have also begun to transform their old worldviews, establish proletarian worldviews, more deeply understand the thoughts, feelings, and aspirations of workers, peasants, and soldiers, become familiar with their language, and absorb their wisdom, adding favorable conditions for them to portray the images of workers, peasants, and soldiers.

It is extremely gratifying that the "old soldiers" of the drama world, including many famous performing artists, playwrights, and drama educators, have joined the ranks of the Party. Some, despite being very old, still diligently study and practice with the spirit of "learning until old" in politics and art, and strive for self-improvement. This is truly a good example for the drama world. The older generation is also constantly striving to further improve themselves. It is also gratifying that we have trained a large number of new drama cadres and excellent young actors in the past eleven years, who have become the main force active on today's people's stage.

All opera genres have been developed on the basis of excellent traditions

The principles of "Let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of thought contend" and "Weeding through the old to bring forth the new" proposed by Comrade Mao Zedong have become the fundamental guidelines for the development of science, culture, literature, and art in our country. This principle has enabled Kunqu Opera, Peking Opera, and various local operas and folk operas to develop rapidly and universally in our country.

Ethnic minorities previously only had song and dance, and very little drama. Since liberation, efforts in this area have been strengthened. In less than a decade, thanks to the help of Soviet experts, we have trained a group of opera and ballet talents. At the same time, our national dance dramas have also grown rapidly.

Modern dramas and new operas, which have excellent conditions for portraying modern life, have had working and learning conditions that are incomparable to those before liberation in the eleven years since the founding of the People's Republic. Therefore, the quality and quantity of works and performances have also improved extremely rapidly.

Shadow puppetry, puppetry, and acrobatics have a long history in China. Before liberation, due to the ravages and abuses of the ruling class, it was difficult to find a few complete professional troupes, but after the founding of the People's Republic, the number of professional shadow puppetry, puppetry, and acrobatics troupes reached 327 by 1958. They improved their ideology and art, improved their performance methods, and many excellent programs appeared in the two national performance festivals, and they also received good reviews during foreign visits.

With the increasing development of the country's radio and television industry, radio dramas and TV dramas have emerged. These two young and sharp opera genres have played the role of light cavalry in rapidly reflecting current political struggles and publicizing the Party's guidelines and policies.

Every opera genre has its own tradition and the overall tradition of Chinese drama. Whether they can bloom beautifully depends on whether their attitude towards tradition is correct.

The slogan of "Weeding through the old to bring forth the new" was put forward in 1942. It shows us the Marxist-Leninist spirit of treating cultural heritage. Owning a rich cultural heritage is our advantageous condition for engaging in artistic creation. With the rich heritage of the ancients as a reference, our creative achievements will be faster and better. However, there are democratic and progressive parts in the heritage, as well as feudal and backward parts. We must treat them differently, absorb all the beneficial essence and discard all the harmful dross. This is critically inheriting the tradition. Inheritance is only for reference and can never replace creation. "Weeding through the old to bring forth the new" means drawing on the old and creating the new. "Weeding through" must not be understood as simply "pushing away the old" to create new ones, but only to carry out artistic innovation and creation on the basis of excellent traditions.

Taking the Kunqu Opera "Fifteen Strings of Cash" as an example, the original work of this opera has the democratic part of Kuang Zhong pleading for the lives of wrongly convicted prisoners, and finally solving the case through repeated investigations and visits, as well as the feudal superstitious parts such as "The Dream of Two Bears". The adapter deleted the feudal superstitious parts and highlighted the democratic part of anti-bureaucracy and anti-subjectivism, making this opera a good opera with educational significance. This is a concrete example of weeding through the old to bring forth the new.

It is gratifying that modern dramas, operas, dance dramas, etc., which paid less attention to the traditions of the motherland in the past, have also greatly increased their interest in learning from tradition. This is completely necessary. We must learn foreign art forms honestly and authentically, and also make arduous efforts to nationalize and popularize them. Only by taking root in Chinese soil and blossoming with national style can they be loved by the Chinese laboring masses, so it is said that "the more nationalized, the more popularized."

Great achievements in opera reform

The achievements in the reform of Chinese opera are worth writing about in detail.

The first National Opera Observation and Performance Conference in 1952 reviewed the preliminary achievements of opera reform in the three years since the founding of the People's Republic. After that, there were two repertoire work conferences and a symposium on opera's portrayal of modern life in 1956 and 1957. Under the guidance of Comrade Mao Zedong's thought of literature and art serving workers, peasants, and soldiers and the principles of "Let a hundred flowers bloom, weeding through the old to bring forth the new", opera workers have sorted out, adapted, and created many repertoires with relatively high ideological and artistic qualities, enriching the people's cultural life.

Our excellent opera art heritage is very rich and colorful. Its common feature is that many operas have a clear theme, with a clear distinction between good and evil, love and hate; at the same time, no matter how unfortunate personal or collective encounters are written, it always gives you a kind of hope. The Chinese laboring people believe that history is advancing and everything will have a correct result. For this result, they are fighting unyieldingly. In history, the Chinese people have carried out countless wars to liberate themselves and resist aggression and oppression, and have also suffered countless setbacks. However, opera authors and artists never write such wars in a dark and bleak way. On the contrary, they are all permeated with the spirit of Chinese people's optimism and heroism. The heroic figures in our operas often sacrifice the interests of themselves and their families without hesitation in the face of national and people's interests. Many mythological dramas express the passionate feelings of young men and women who unyieldingly resist oppressors and pursue a happy life. As Comrade Zhou Yang said, "The realism in Chinese opera has its unique features. It truthfully reflects the cruel reality of feudal society, and passionately expresses the ideals, hopes, and confidence for a better life in the future; here, realism and romanticism have achieved a harmonious combination." This combination is in line with the artistic method of combining revolutionary realism and revolutionary romanticism advocated by Comrade Mao Zedong.

In the past eleven years, opera workers have not only been good at portraying historical figures, but also have made fruitful achievements in using opera forms to portray the heroic mass era, reflect the socialist Great Leap Forward, and portray the lives of workers, peasants, and soldiers. This has given many opera genres unprecedented artistic vitality.

Development of Modern Drama, New Opera and Other Opera Genres

After the national liberation, modern drama workers were more widely and deeply integrated with the laboring masses, so they could more vividly and powerfully reflect the new mass era and shape new heroic figures in production struggles and struggles against the enemy.

The modern drama creations of the past eleven years include those that write about industrial construction and its ideological struggles; those that write about the socialist transformation of agriculture; those that write about the great changes in the lives of urban people after liberation; those that write about the transformation of intellectuals; those that sing praises of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Commune; those that write about the communist spirit of cooperation in which one place helps another in industrial and agricultural construction; and those that write about cities running people's communes in a big way. There are also those that write about the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea and the struggle against the enemy on the Fujian front, and these plays have deeply exposed the aggressive nature and conspiracies of U.S. imperialism.

In reflecting the history of revolutionary struggles, we have made outstanding achievements. From the February 7th Great Strike led by the Party, the August 1st Nanchang Uprising, the 25,000-mile Long March of the Chinese Workers' and Peasants' Red Army to the War of Resistance Against Japan and the People's Liberation War, we can see its moving scenes and prominent heroic figures on the stage.

Some plays that reflect the lives and struggles of fraternal ethnic groups profoundly depict the suffering days during the warlord rule before liberation, the remnant reactionaries provoking ethnic hatred in the early days of liberation, refusing reform, and at the same time, revolutionary cadres and the people consolidating and developing ethnic unity under the guidance of the Party's ethnic policies, overthrowing the common enemy that hindered reform, and the soaring love of the people of all ethnic groups for the Party and Chairman Mao. The ideological and artistic achievements of these plays are very gratifying, but they need to be further strengthened.

One-act plays, which are known for their brevity and ability to quickly reflect life, have been promoted in our country. Some of the excellent works that appeared in the early days of liberation powerfully portrayed the images of advanced women who fought for their complete liberation from feudal oppression and resolutely took the socialist road. In today's era of people's communes and the ever-changing face of the country, such plays are appearing in large numbers with amazing quality.

Our modern dramas not only regard reflecting current life and struggles as their main responsibility, but also strive to reproduce politicians, military strategists, poets, artists, scholars, and outstanding figures in hundreds of crafts who have contributed to the people in historical legends, in order to educate and encourage today's people.

Children's dramas have developed rapidly after liberation. These works either encourage children with the excellent qualities and heroic deeds of Young Pioneers and League members; or use fables of people and animals to warn against laziness and pride; or recall the history of the revolution, so that children know that today's happy life was won by the predecessors who shed a lot of blood and sweat. This is of great benefit to child audiences. However, there are still too few people writing children's dramas, and we must serve the successors of communism better and more.

Although the history of new opera is short, it was one of the direct products of the Yan'an Rectification Movement. New opera workers resolutely implemented the road of integrating with workers, peasants, and soldiers as instructed by Chairman Mao, strived to create on the basis of inheriting traditions, and used it to mainly reflect the struggle life of the masses of people at the time. Therefore, new opera became a new revolutionary art in the liberated areas in a very short period of time. Since the founding of New China, new opera has been further developed nationwide. In the new opera creations of the past eleven years, most of them are works that recall the history of the revolution, and some of them sing praises of today's socialist reality. These plays have been welcomed by the majority of audiences.

Shadow puppetry, puppetry, acrobatics, etc. have greatly improved their ideological and artistic level. Not only have they swept the dust off traditional programs, but they can also vividly portray modern life, sing praises of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Commune, and also portray the heroic spirit of revolutionary soldiers and civilians in the struggle against the enemy.

The vigorous development of amateur dramatic art of workers, peasants, and soldiers

As the creators of history, workers, peasants, and soldiers are not only inspired by artistic images to carry out production and struggle with greater enthusiasm, but they can also participate in artistic activities and directly create moving artistic images. Over the past eleven years, amateur drama activities have been widely carried out in factories, rural areas, troops, organs, and schools. Workers, peasants, soldiers, cadres, and students have used artistic forms that they are more familiar with and easier to master in their spare time from production, work, and study to perform moving stories in their production, work, and study, and sing praises of the heroic models in their teams to encourage themselves and educate themselves. Some of these works have high ideological and artistic quality, and are often processed and promoted by professional authors and troupes, and then encourage the broad masses of the people, educate the broad masses of the people, and enrich the socialist drama and art treasure house.

Under the leadership and arrangement of the Party, the combination of the masses and experts; the combination of amateur and professional; the combination of popularization and improvement; will make our country's socialist dramatic art deeply rooted and long-lasting.

The Great Leap Forward in Dramatic Performance, Directing, and Stage Art

We first clarified the ugly and low-level stage images that were not conducive to cultivating people's noble qualities and aesthetic interests. Some terrifying, obscene, vulgar, and low-level things have disappeared from our stage. With the sorting out and adaptation of traditional repertoires, the art of performance has also been greatly improved. In addition to the techniques learned from their masters, the actors have been able to think independently and carry out artistic creation on the stage according to the requirements of the characters in the play. Opera actors can not only portray outstanding historical figures, but also shape contemporary heroic figures.

The improvement of opera performance art is inseparable from the widespread establishment of the directing system. In the past, opera art mainly relied on the teaching of masters, and famous actors arranged their own signature plays. Therefore, in the past, there were many individual performances to watch in old plays, but as a play, it often lacked overall precision and symmetry. After liberation, the gradual establishment of the directing system greatly changed the face of the opera stage, giving people a more complete and unified impression. Because these directors mainly came from modern drama and new opera, they initially had the problem of subjectively "hard搬" (hard moving), which once caused some contradictions and difficulties. Since the Party called on new literary and art workers to thoroughly and critically study traditions, and carry out innovation and creation on the basis of traditions, the tendency of 生拉硬掼 (forcing and straining) was quickly corrected. Today, opera directors have been able to design and practice according to the inherent laws and styles of opera itself. Many directors who came from opera actors have increased their understanding of Chinese opera art due to learning political culture and drawing on advanced foreign theories, and their work has become more outstanding.

In terms of the improvement of opera music and art, there were two problems that troubled us, one is whether today's opera stage should use lighting and scenery? Due to the progress of the times and the formation of new appreciation habits of the people, it is difficult to completely refuse to use scenery. The abuse of mechanical scenery and colored lights in the past has passed, and today's question is how to create stage installations and lighting that are more suitable for the nature of opera scripts and the characteristics of opera performances. In this regard, our stage artists have made many useful attempts.

Another problem is that the original relatively simple singing and tunes of some opera genres are not enough to fully express the people's broad and rich fighting life, high-spirited and enthusiastic feelings, and majestic spirit today. In order to solve the contradiction between new content and old forms, artists have also done a lot of work. Some are excavated from the opera genre itself, some are creatively transplanted from fraternal opera genres close to it, and some are recomposed. These attempts are generally successful. This has made many opera genres get rid of their previous simple and stagnant state and become more smooth and lively. We advocate new creation, but we require that creation or transplantation be carried out on the basis of tradition, without losing the original characteristics and style of the opera genre, otherwise it is easy to go against the Party's principle of letting a hundred flowers bloom.

After liberation, we put the portrayal of worker-peasant-soldier heroic images in modern drama and new opera in the first place. We require performing artists to fully embody the thoughts, feelings, and aspirations of workers, peasants, and soldiers and become spokespersons for workers, peasants, and soldiers. This cannot but require actors, directors, and stage workers to further industrialize, peasantize, and laborize.

Only on the basis of deeply immersing in life and fully mastering artistic skills can we shape the moving images of workers, peasants, soldiers, and their cadres.

In the more than 280 multi-act plays we have performed in the past eleven years, foreign plays account for 55. We not only learn about the heroic deeds of the people of various countries in the past and their lives and struggles today through these plays, but also learn many methods of expressing life.

Similarly, modern drama has also begun to learn from traditional performance methods. Starting with the Beijing People's Art Theater's "Tiger Tally", historical dramas used gongs and drums and some Peking Opera movements to enhance the sense of rhythm. By the time the China Youth Art Theater's modern drama "Subduing Dragons and Tigers" came out, opera movements and gongs and drums were used to express the enthusiastic revolutionary competition spirit of catching up with the advanced and comparing with the advanced. These are all beneficial experiments. The increasingly close combination of modern drama and music has also become a noteworthy good phenomenon.

In the past eleven years, many excellent actors, directors, composers, band conductors, and performers of new opera have been trained. There have also been good achievements in learning from tradition in terms of tunes and performance methods.

Gains in theoretical criticism

In the past eleven years, our drama criticism has been quite active and has played an important role in promoting the development of dramatic art. In the early days of liberation, our criticism focused more on the political content of the repertoires, because we wanted to "change the plays" and make the content of the repertoires more in line with the needs of the people in the new era. Our drama workers are the opposite of those in capitalist countries. First of all, we do not allow any obscene, decadent, terrifying, or backward things in the repertoires to poison the people. Our drama criticism must first do the work of disinfection. However, today, in addition to continuing to pay attention to the ideological content of the repertoires, we must also conduct artistic reviews and analyses of the director's handling methods, the actors' performance skills, and the creations in stage, music, and art. Our great people cannot tolerate repertoires with serious errors in political thought, but they also do not like to watch things that have no major political errors but are very poor in artistry. Our people require works with a high degree of combination of politics and art, and works with both form and spirit. Our people have always had great respect and love for actors who perform well, and they do not bury the achievements of all stage workers.

We must humbly accept criticism and maintain high vigilance. Some people say that the artistry of some of our plays is not enough and that they are "dry". They ask us to add some so-called "human touch". We are not satisfied with works that lack artistry either. Comrade Mao Zedong once said: "Artistic works that lack artistry, no matter how progressive they are politically, are also powerless". But we resolutely refuse to use the bourgeois "human touch" or add some yellow and corrupt things to add so-called artistry. We are a nation that is determined to become strong. We are optimistic, active, and hardworking and simple. This is the characteristic of the Chinese people, and our drama must also maintain this characteristic and must not be corroded by bourgeois ideology. Many of our dramas are about the War of Resistance Against Japan, the Liberation War, the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea, and the struggle against the enemy in Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen, and Matsu. Therefore, some people say, "Your plays are good, but unfortunately, they have too much gunpowder smell". They think that such plays are not popular in today's era of peace. Chinese playwrights who have not lost their sense of smell can immediately feel the harm of this statement, because although imperialism is in its dying stage, its aggressive and war-loving nature will never change, and we have no reason to relax our vigilance at all. We love peace, but we are not pacifists. We oppose imperialist wars of aggression and support all just wars that oppose imperialism and fight for national independence, democracy, freedom, and socialism. Our drama will also maintain its fighting tradition and maintain this "gunpowder smell" of resolutely fighting against the enemy!

In addition, there is also the large-scale development of drama education, the establishment of drama book and publication institutions, and the frequent international drama cultural exchanges. The achievements of our people's drama career are endless. These achievements should be thanked to the Party and Chairman Mao. Every victory in drama work is a victory of the Party and Comrade Mao Zedong's wise literary and artistic thought! It is the victory of the correct direction of literature and art serving workers, peasants, and soldiers! It is the victory of the firm literary and artistic policy of letting a hundred flowers bloom, letting a hundred schools of thought contend, and weeding through the old to bring forth the new under the direction of workers, peasants, and soldiers! It is the victory of the artistic method of combining revolutionary realism and revolutionary romanticism proposed by Comrade Mao Zedong! As long as we move forward in accordance with the principles, policies, and methods formulated by the Party and Comrade Mao Zedong, we will be invincible and invincible. The future of our working-class socialist drama is infinitely bright!

Several issues in creation

However, we have no reason to be satisfied with the achievements we have already made. There are still some problems in our work. First of all, our creation and adaptation work, whether in terms of quality or quantity, is far from meeting the increasingly high demands of the people and the vast number of professional and amateur drama troupes today. Many important struggles in revolutionary history and the current stage of the revolution, and many outstanding figures and deeds that have contributed to the people have not been reflected or fully reflected. The fighting experience and artistic experience of many playwrights and performing artists of previous generations and modern times need to be further recorded and sorted out; the combination of our playwrights and performing artists with the laboring people and with production labor is not yet implemented universally and deeply enough; the political and ideological level of our team is also not balanced, and modern revisionism and bourgeois ideology still have their markets; Marxist theoretical criticism is not active enough, and the team is not strong enough. We need to catch up and overcome these shortcomings as soon as possible.

Here, I will mainly raise the following three issues for comrades to discuss.

The issue of shaping new heroic figures

We are in a great era in which the masses of the people are transforming themselves in the process of transforming the world. The communist style of the laboring people is growing rapidly, and as Engels said, "stubborn, revolutionary proletarians who command the wind and clouds" are emerging everywhere. It is the glorious duty of our drama workers to portray these heroic figures with the greatest enthusiasm and highest skill to educate the people and inspire the people. Our various opera genres reflect this great era in different forms and styles, and have created vivid images of workers, peasants, soldiers, revolutionary cadres, and revolutionary intellectuals. We have also created a batch of historical-themed plays, portraying the outstanding children in the ancient people's struggle, which is also of great encouragement to the people today.

Completing this task requires struggle. First of all, should we write about heroic figures? This should not be a problem. But, no, there is a problem! Some people say: The human soul is complex, with both good and evil, with both light and darkness, and the two are constantly fighting in the depths of the soul. Therefore, there is no "flawless" person in the world, and there is no truly heroic figure worthy of emulation. In their view, those selfless and self-sacrificing heroic images with communist moral qualities are all untrue and do not conform to "human nature". It seems that only writing about characters with inner wavering and split personality is true. This is of course the fallacy of the imperialist cultural henchmen who are trying to disintegrate our morale - the modern revisionists.

This so-called "realism" of the revisionists is just a pretext to exaggerate the individual shortcomings of the new society to attack the socialist system and attack the proletariat. What they cannot but feel sad about is that only the proletariat can produce heroic figures today, and the decadent and declining bourgeoisie no longer has an advanced and upward moral force. Therefore, all they can do is to reverse black and white and confuse right and wrong. For example, in British and American dramas and films, the pickets of striking workers are written as thugs, while the scabs who sabotage the strike are written as heroic figures. As Comrade Mao Zedong said, "Bourgeois writers in the reactionary period wrote the revolutionary masses as thugs and themselves as sacred. The so-called light and darkness are reversed." Another manifestation of them is that although they cannot but admit the existence of the sun, they desperately look for black spots in the sun and find shortcomings in the new heroic figures. In this way, they can prove that "crows all over the world are generally black", and they can fundamentally deny that there is really a communist noble quality in the world. This is good for protecting capitalism. We do not generally oppose writing about the shortcomings of heroic figures, but we believe that we must strictly distinguish between certain shortcomings of heroic figures in the process of growth, certain mistakes and deviations in daily work, and defects in political and moral qualities. If a person is hypocritical, selfish, wavering, and compromising, then he can only be a negative character, not a hero.

Comrade Zhou Yang called on us to portray heroic figures of the socialist era at the Second National Congress of Literary and Art Workers in 1953, and again made the same call to us at the Third National Congress of Literary and Art Workers.

Comrade Zhou Yang believes that revolutionary artists should shape such characters who can best embody the revolutionary ideals of the proletariat, and through the images of these revolutionary ideal characters, they can move millions of people to push society forward.

This call is more powerful than before because Comrade Mao Zedong has given us new sharp ideological weapons - the artistic method of combining revolutionary realism and revolutionary romanticism. Our revolutionary romanticism is essentially revolutionary idealism. Our revolutionary practice is constantly guided and inspired by revolutionary ideals, and hundreds of millions of revolutionary people are advancing with the force of ten thousand horses towards the realization of the lofty communist ideals they have accepted, despising any hardships and difficulties, and overcoming any obstacles. This great spirit cannot be compared with things like Yugong moving mountains and Jingwei filling the sea. Because of this, China has been able to create countless unprecedented miracles in all aspects of construction in just eleven years. Some people think that ideals that are difficult to achieve have become a reality for us one after another. It can be seen that our romanticism and idealism are not additional, but the dominant part. Only this communist great ideal and the great reality of revolutionary struggle can cultivate the most lofty and outstanding figures of this era. Only the combination of these two can produce the most lofty and outstanding works. The revisionists are doing their best to belittle and obliterate our revolutionary ideals, and we are to promote this ideal, defend this ideal, and work hard and unyieldingly to realize this ideal. The realistic creation method becomes revolutionary realism because it is combined with revolutionary ideals. Realism without ideals becomes vulgar naturalism and decadence. Therefore, I imagine that once our performance, directing art and the entire stage art fully embody the spirit of Comrade Mao Zedong's revolutionary realism and revolutionary romanticism, it will exert incomparably powerful vitality and emit unprecedented brilliant light.

In order to express this incomparably magnificent mass era and heroic era in which we are located, we can only use a heroic rather than gloomy language; we can only use majestic and high-spirited rather than low-pitched tones; we can only use bright rather than gray colors; and we can only use the artistic method of combining revolutionary romanticism and revolutionary realism rather than trivial naturalistic techniques. Check the artistic methods we have used in the past, and there are still some gloomy, low-pitched, gray, and trivial naturalistic things. In order to express the new era and new heroic figures more appropriately, we should abandon these things. In that way, a new face will appear on our people's stage!

How to correctly treat and handle the contradictions and conflicts in drama

Comrade Mao Zedong said: "Contradictions constantly appear and are constantly resolved. This is the dialectical law of the development of things". This is also the dialectical law of drama creation - "There is no drama without conflict."

When we mention shaping the heroic image of the great era, we will inevitably come into contact with the issue of contradiction and conflict. Because this great era of ours is an era of struggle, an era full of internal and external contradictions. First of all, there is a sharp contradiction between the Chinese people and imperialism and its servants, and there is also a series of contradictions within the people. None of our heroes are cultivated in greenhouses. No, they are all being tempered in the earth-shaking storm of struggle. They showed their new thoughts and new qualities as the advanced elements of this great era in the struggle with old ideas and old things, and in the struggle with all the negative phenomena that violated the interests of the people. If we avoid the shortcomings and difficulties in life, narrow or obliterate its opposites, and omit the sharp contradiction and struggle when shaping these heroic figures, then no matter how much we spend, this heroic figure will still be pale and powerless.

Some people do not admit that there are still contradictions within the people under the socialist system. They insist that there is only the difference between good and better, and only the difference between advanced and backward in our lives. Some people even say that now there is only the contradiction between man and nature, and there is no contradiction between people. Therefore, it is difficult for dramatic works to reflect vivid and true social contradictions, and they can only rely on artificial methods to find dramatic conflicts. Some people think that the saying "No conflict, no drama" is an outdated argument that should be discarded by bourgeois playwrights.

The root cause of this "no conflict theory" is that they are divorced from life, cannot see the contradictions existing in life, and do not understand the law of the unity of opposites. Comrade Mao Zedong said: "Many people do not admit that there are still contradictions in socialist society, which makes them hesitant and passive in the face of social contradictions; they do not understand that in the process of constantly correctly handling and resolving contradictions, the unity and solidarity within socialist society will be consolidated day by day." A few playwrights only focus on rendering the atmosphere of life and some superficial phenomena in their works, and dare not touch the essence of life, avoid the contradictions and conflicts in life, thus making the character images dim and the ideology weak and powerless. Some comrades do not intentionally avoid contradictions and conflicts but cannot see contradictions and conflicts. They do not know that "there is nothing that does not contain contradictions, and there is no world without contradictions". The only question is whether we are good at observing and analyzing the contradictions of various things. It is undeniable that these comrades who have not written about contradiction and struggle are not necessarily "no conflict theorists", but they cannot typify the contradictions and struggles in life through deep observation.

The "no conflict theory" is actually spreading the theory of the extinction of class struggle. They are trying to make us forget that there is still a struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, and between the socialist and capitalist roads in our country. This struggle is unavoidable throughout the transition period. Just like waves, sometimes it is low, sometimes it is high, sometimes it is gentle, and sometimes it is sharp. This struggle will not be extinguished until the political and ideological influence of the bourgeoisie is finally eliminated.

On the other hand, the revisionists exaggerate and distort the contradictions within our people. As mentioned earlier, they are selling black goods that expose the "dark side" of the new society under the guise of "realism". They avoid talking about the struggle between the socialist and capitalist roads that still exists in our country, but deliberately say that the main contradiction in our society is the contradiction between the individual interests of the masses and the interests of the state and the collective; the contradiction between the bureaucratic style of leading cadres and the interests of the masses; and the contradiction between the commandism of the staff and the enthusiasm and creativity of the masses in production. They sarcastically called the works that sang praises of the new society "whitewashing reality", and they advocated exposing the dark side of the new society, saying that this is in line with the "critical realism" tradition. Some revisionists have even falsely accused us of being "no conflict theorists" because we do not advocate writing about the so-called "dark side" of the new society, which only exposes their shameful conspiracy as servants of imperialism. Their intention is nothing more than to demand that temperature and humidity be given in order to cultivate revisionist weeds, so that they can oppose the Party and socialism without any "subjective and objective constraints". Of course, their wishful thinking will not succeed.

We say that the struggle between the socialist and capitalist roads is the main contradiction in the country today, and the main contradiction in life must also be reflected in drama. But it does not mean that all works must express this contradiction. We oppose the revisionists saying that the contradiction between leaders and those being led is the main contradiction today, because it does not conform to the facts. This is a smokescreen played by the revisionists, whose purpose is to protect the bourgeoisie and attack the proletariat.

The life of the people is originally rich and colorful, and the literature and art that reflect the life of the people should of course be rich and colorful. We advocate writing about the main contradictions, but we also welcome writing about any other contradictions that have practical significance. Our purpose is only to help the new defeat the old. We want to enthusiastically sing praises of new ideas and new things, and lash out at old ideas and old things; shape the radiant heroic images of the proletariat and the labor

    建国十一年来戏剧战线的斗争和今后的任务
    ——在中国戏剧家协会第二次会员代表大会上的报告摘要
    田汉
    过去十一年间，我国人民在党的英明领导下，取得了社会主义革命和社会主义建设的伟大胜利；特别是从1958年起，在党的鼓足干劲、力争上游、多快好省地建设社会主义的总路线的光辉照耀下，取得了工农业生产的连续大跃进。为了以更大范围、更高速度解放和发展社会生产力，首先在全国农村实现了人民公社化。总路线、大跃进、人民公社这三个法宝正在使我国改变长期以来“一穷二白”的面貌。由于十一年来我国戏剧工作者紧紧地跟着党走，用自己的艺术为社会主义革命和社会主义建设服务，从而也大大改变了中国戏剧艺术的面貌。如果说在十一年前中国戏剧工作者的极大部分是资产阶级民主主义者，有的甚至还有浓厚的封建思想，那么在十一年后的今天，一支以工人阶级戏剧工作者为骨干的戏剧队伍就已经形成，能够以较高的思想觉悟为工农兵服务了。如果说十一年前我们的戏剧，特别是戏曲，从内容到形式还夹杂有不健康的、神怪、恐怖、色情的东西，还是珠玉与泥沙的混合物，那么十一年后的今天，中国戏剧已经是明丽爽朗、珠玉满眼，尽管作为新事物还难免有稚弱粗糙的东西，但泥沙尘土已经淘洗得比较干净了。如果说十一年前的中国戏剧在反动统治的摧残压迫下有的陷于停滞，得不到应有的发展；有的雕伤枯瘦，日就衰亡，那末十一年后的今天，剧种由1952年的一百二十种，增加到今天的四百七十种；专业剧场由1949年的八百九十一座，增加到1959年的二千八百座；艺术表演团体的从业人员由1949年的五万零九百多人增加到1959年的二十六万人；艺术表演团体由1949年的一千个，增加到1959年底的三千五百一十三个了。目前职工业余剧团已达三万九千个，农村业余剧团和文工团达二十四万四千多个。
    短短十一年间实现这样大规模、高速度、高质量的发展，只有在社会主义国家才有可能，也只有在党和毛泽东同志英明领导下才有可能。
    我们试把十一年来的成就和主要经验归于以下几点：
    通过工农化劳动化改造和壮大了我们的队伍
    党对戏剧工作者特别是广大艺人予以极大关心和爱护，人民共和国成立后不只大大提高了艺人的社会地位，为了改造旧艺人和广大戏剧工作者，党采取了许多周到的措施和耐心的步骤。十一年来戏剧工作者们参加了历次的政治运动，和经常的政治思想学习，特别是1957年整风以后，戏剧队伍分批上山、下乡、下厂、到连队、到前线，与工农兵紧密结合，时常一面参加生产劳动，一面进行表演，把自己最拿手的艺术忠诚地热烈地献给工农兵群众，其规模之大，影响之深是从来没有过的。这大大鼓舞了工农劳动群众的生产积极性和部队指战员的战斗情绪。戏剧工作者本身也开始改造了自己旧的世界观，树立了无产阶级的世界观，更深刻地理解了工农兵的思想感情和愿望，熟悉了他们的语言，吸取了他们的智慧，给自己刻划工农兵形象增添了有利条件。
    戏剧界的“老兵”们包括许多著名的表演艺术家、剧作家、戏剧教育家参加了党的队伍，是极可庆喜的现象。有的人尽管年纪已经十分高迈，但在政治上艺术上都还以“学到老”的精神，勤学苦练，自强不息，这真是戏剧界的好榜样。成年一代也为进一步提高自己而不断努力。还有值得高兴的是，十一年来我们培养了大批新的戏剧干部和优秀的青年演员，成为活跃在今天人民舞台上的主要力量。
    在优秀传统基础上使一切剧种都得到发展
    毛泽东同志所提出的百花齐放、百家争鸣和推陈出新成了发展我国科学文化和文学艺术的根本方针。这一方针使我国昆剧、京剧和各种地方戏、民间小戏都得到了迅速而普遍的发展。
    少数民族以前只有歌舞，很少有戏剧，解放后才加强了这方面的努力。在不到十年的日月，感谢苏联专家的帮助，我们培养了一批歌剧和芭蕾舞剧的人材。同时，我们的民族舞剧也飞速地成长起来了。
    对表现现代生活具有优异条件的话剧、新歌剧，在建国后十一年间，工作条件学习条件非解放前可比。因而作品和演出的质量数量也提高得极快。
    皮影、木偶、杂技在中国有悠久的历史。解放前由于统治阶级的摧残磨折已经很难找到几个完整的专业剧团了，但在建国后皮影、木偶、杂技等专业团体到1958年已达三百二十七个之多。它们提高了思想、艺术，改进了演出方法，在两次全国会演中出现了许多优秀节目，出国访问也获得好评。
    随着国家广播电视事业的日益发展，产生了广播剧和电视剧。这两个年轻的新锐的剧种在迅速反映当前政治斗争、宣传党的方针政策起了轻骑兵的作用。
    每一种戏都有它本身的传统和作为中国戏剧的总的传统。它们是否都能开出美丽的花朵，就要看它们对待传统的态度是否正确。
    推陈出新的口号是在1942年提出的。它给我们昭示了对待文化遗产的马克思列宁主义的精神。拥有丰富的文化遗产本是我们从事艺术创造的有利条件，有了古人的丰富遗产作为借鉴，就会使我们的创造成就更快、更好。但遗产中有民主进步部分，也有封建落后部分。我们必须区别对待，吸收其中一切有益的精华而舍弃其一切有害的糟粕。这就是批判地继承传统。继承只是为了借鉴，决不能代替创造。推陈出新就是借鉴旧的，创造新的。“推陈”决不能理解为简单地“推开旧的”另创新的，只能是在优秀传统的基础上展开艺术的革新创造。
    以昆剧的《十五贯》为例，这个戏的原作有况钟为受屈的死囚请命，通过再三勘查访问，终于破案的民主性部分，也有《双熊梦》等封建迷信部分。改编者删去封建迷信部分，突出它反官僚主义、反主观主义的民主性部分，使这个戏成为富有教育意义的好戏。这就是推陈出新的具体范例。
    值得高兴的是过去对祖国传统注意得较少的话剧、歌剧、舞剧等，也大大提高了向传统学习的兴趣。这是完全必要的，我们对于外来的艺术形式又要学得老实地道，又要进行艰苦的努力使它民族化、群众化。只有在中国土壤上生根，开出具有民族风格的花朵。这样才能为中国劳动群众所喜闻乐见，所以说“越民族化，就越群众化”。
    戏曲改革的巨大成就
    中国戏曲改革方面的成就是值得大书特书的。
    1952年第一届全国戏曲观摩演出大会检阅了建国后三年间戏曲改革的初步成绩。其后又经过1956年和1957年两次剧目工作会议和戏曲表现现代生活座谈会。戏曲工作者在毛泽东同志文艺为工农兵服务和百花齐放、推陈出新的思想指导下，整理、改编和创作了许多思想性艺术性都相当高的剧目，丰富了人民的文化生活。
    我们优秀的戏曲艺术遗产是十分丰富多彩的。它的共同特色是许多戏都有一个明确的主题，善恶爱憎分明；同时不管写多么不幸的个人遭遇或集体遭遇，总是给你一种希望。中国劳动人民认为历史是前进的，一切是会有个正确的结果的。为着这个结果他们不屈不挠地战斗着。在历史上中国人民为着解放自己，反抗侵略压迫，进行过无数次的战争，也遭受过无数次的挫折。但戏曲作者和艺术家从不把这样的战争写得阴阴暗暗，凄凄惨惨，相反地却都贯串着中国人民乐观主义、英雄主义的精神。我们的戏曲里的英雄人物在国家利益人民利益面前常常毫不踌躇地牺牲一身一家的利益。许多神话剧表现了青年男女不屈不挠地反抗压迫者追求幸福生活的热烈感情。正如周扬同志所说，“中国戏曲中的现实主义是具有它的独特之处的。它既真实地反映了封建社会的残酷的现实，又热情地表现了对于未来美好生活的理想、希望和信心；在这里，现实主义和浪漫主义取得了和谐的结合。”这种结合是与毛泽东同志提倡的革命现实主义与革命浪漫主义相结合的艺术方法有其一脉相通之处的。
    十一年来戏曲工作者不止善于表现历史人物，对于用戏曲形式表现英雄的群众时代，反映社会主义大跃进，表现工农兵生活也有丰硕的成就。这就使许多戏曲剧种获得了前所未有的艺术生命力。
    话剧、新歌剧及其他剧种的发展
    全国解放以后，话剧工作者更广泛深入地与劳动群众相结合，因而更能鲜明有力地反映新的群众时代，塑造生产斗争和对敌斗争的新的英雄人物。
    十一年来的话剧创作有写工业建设及其思想斗争的；有写农业社会主义改造的；有写解放后城市人民生活的巨大变化的；有写知识分子改造的；有歌颂总路线、大跃进、人民公社的；有写工农业建设中一地有事八方支援的共产主义协作精神的；有写城市大办人民公社的。还有写抗美援朝斗争和福建前线的对敌斗争的，这些剧本对美帝国主义的侵略本性和阴谋活动做了深刻暴露。
    在反映革命斗争历史方面，我们有出色的成就，从党领导的二七大罢工、八一南昌起义、中国工农红军二万五千里长征到抗日战争、人民解放战争等几个重要阶段，都能在舞台上看到它的动人场面和突出的英雄人物。
    一些反映兄弟民族的生活和斗争的剧作深刻地描绘了解放以前军阀统治时期的苦难的日子，解放初期残余反动派挑拨民族仇恨，拒绝改革，同时革命干部和人民在党的民族政策指导下巩固和发展了民族团结，打倒了阻碍改革的共同敌人，以及飞跃前进的各民族人民对党和毛主席的无比爱戴。这些戏的思想艺术成就是十分使人欢喜的，但还有待进一步地加强。
    以短小精悍、迅速反映生活见长的独幕剧在我国得到了提倡。在解放初期出现的优秀作品，有些有力地刻划了从封建压迫下争取自己彻底解放、坚决走社会主义道路的先进妇女们的形象。在人民公社化、国家面貌一天天变化的今天，这类剧作更以惊人质量大批出现。
    我们的话剧不单是把反映当前生活和斗争当作自己的主要职责，而且努力再现历史传说中对人民有功的政治家、军事家、诗人、艺术家、学者以及百工技艺的杰出人物，来教育和鼓舞今天的人民。
    解放后儿童剧得到了迅速发展。这些作品或者以团员队员们的优秀品质和英雄事迹鼓舞儿童；或者借人和动物的寓言戒懒惰，戒骄傲；或者回忆革命史，让儿童们知道今天的幸福生活是前人流了大量的血和汗斗争得来的。这对于儿童观众有很大好处。但写儿童剧的人还是太少了，我们一定要更好更多地为共产主义接班人服务。
    新歌剧的历史虽短，但它在延安是文艺整风的直接产物之一。新歌剧工作者坚决执行了毛主席指示的与工农兵结合的道路，努力在继承传统的基础上进行创造，并且用它来主要反映当前人民群众的斗争生活。因此新歌剧在很短的时期内，在解放区成为一门新兴的革命艺术。新中国成立以来，新歌剧在全国范围内得到了进一步的发展。十一年来的新歌剧创作中，大部分是回忆革命史的作品，也有一部分是歌颂今天的社会主义现实的。这些剧作受到了广大观众的欢迎。
    皮影、木偶、杂技等大大提高了思想艺术水平。不止给传统节目拂去了尘土，还能生动地表现现代生活，歌颂总路线、大跃进和人民公社，也表现了对敌斗争中革命军民的英雄气概。
    工农兵业余戏剧艺术的蓬勃发展
    作为历史的创造者的工农兵，他们不止为艺术形象所鼓舞，以更大热情进行生产和斗争，而且他们自己也能参加艺术活动，直接创造动人的艺术形象。十一年来工厂、农村、部队机关、学校普遍开展着业余戏剧活动，工人、农民、战士和干部、学生在生产、工作、学习的余暇用自己所较为熟悉、较易掌握的艺术形式，演出自己生产、工作、学习中的动人故事，歌颂自己队伍中的英雄模范来鼓舞自己、教育自己。这些作品中有思想质量艺术质量都很高的，常常由专业作者和剧团加工推广，进而鼓舞广大人民，教育广大人民，充实和丰富了社会主义戏剧文艺宝库。
    在党的领导和安排下群众与专家相结合；业余与专业相结合；普及与提高相结合；将使我国社会主义戏剧艺术根深蒂固，源远流长。
    戏剧表演、导演和舞台艺术的大跃进
    我们首先澄清了丑恶低级、无助于培养人民高尚品质和审美兴趣的舞台形象。一些恐怖、淫猥庸俗低级的东西从我们舞台上消失了。随着传统剧目的整理改编，表演艺术也大大提高了。演员们除了从师傅学到的技术之外已经能够独立思考，根据剧中人物性格的要求在舞台上进行艺术创造。戏曲演员们不止能表现历史上的杰出人物，而且也塑造了当代英雄人物。
    戏曲表演艺术的改进是跟导演制度的普遍建立分不开的。以前戏曲艺术主要靠师傅传授，名演员的看家戏都是自己排的。因此以前的旧戏个人表演可看的多，而作为一台戏常常缺乏整体的精严和匀称，解放后导演制度的逐渐普遍建立，就使戏曲舞台面目大为改观，给人以更完整更统一的印象了。由于这些导演主要是从话剧、新歌剧出身的，在最初还有主观地“硬搬”的毛病，一度引起了某些矛盾和困难。自从党号召新文艺工作者深入地批判地学习传统，在传统基础上进行革新创造，生拉硬掼的倾向才迅速地改正了。今天戏曲导演已能根据戏曲本身的规律和风格进行设计和实践了。许多从戏曲演员出身的导演由于学习政治文化和借鉴外国先进理论，增进了对中国戏曲艺术的认识，工作也做得更出色了。
    在戏曲音乐美术的改进方面，使我们苦恼的曾经有两个问题，一个是今天的戏曲舞台要不要用灯光布景？由于时代的进展，人民新的欣赏习惯的养成，完全拒绝使用布景是困难的。过去机关布景和五彩灯光的滥用已经过去了，今天的问题是如何制作更适合戏曲剧本性质和戏曲表演特点的舞台装置和照明，在这方面我们的舞台美术家已经做了许多有益的尝试。
    另一个问题是，某些剧种原有的较为简单的唱腔和曲牌不足以充分表现今天人民的广阔丰富的战斗生活，高昂热烈的感情，雄伟的气概，为了解决新内容和旧形式之间的矛盾，艺术家们也做了许多工作。有些是从剧种本身挖掘，有的是从接近它的兄弟剧种创造性地移植，有的重新作曲。这些尝试一般地是成功的。这使许多剧种摆脱了以前的简陋停滞状态，变得更为顺畅活泼。我们提倡新的创造，但要求在传统基础上，在不失掉该剧种原有特点、风格的条件下，进行创造或移植，否则就容易走到党的百花齐放的方针的反面。
    解放后，更把话剧、新歌剧表现工农兵英雄形象提到了首要地位。我们要求表演艺术家们充分体现工农兵的思想感情和愿望，成为工农兵的代言人。这就不能不要求演员们、导演们、舞台工作者们进一步工农化、劳动化。
    只有在深入生活，同时充分掌握艺术技巧的基础上，才能塑造出工农兵及其干部的动人形象来。
    十一年间我们演出的二百八十几个多幕剧中，外国戏占五十五个。我们不只通过这些戏了解各国人民过去的英雄事迹和今天的生活和斗争，也学到了许多表现生活的方法。
    同样，话剧也开始向传统的表现方法学习。从北京人民艺术剧院的《虎符》开始，话剧的历史剧使用了锣鼓和一些京剧动作以加强节奏感。到了中国青年艺术剧院的现代剧《降龙伏虎》，更运用戏曲动作和锣鼓来表现赶先进、比先进的热烈的革命竞赛精神。这些都是有益的试验。话剧与音乐结合一天天紧密，也成为一个值得注意的好现象。
    十一年来，培养了许多新歌剧的优秀演员、导演、作曲家、乐队指挥和演奏家。曲调和表演方法上向传统学习也有很好的成就。
    理论批评方面的收获
    十一年来，我们的戏剧批评颇为活跃，在促进戏剧艺术发展上起过重要作用。解放初期，我们的批评比较着重剧目的政治内容，因为我们要“改戏”，要使剧目内容更符合新时代人民的需要。我们的戏剧工作者与资本主义国家的正相反，首先是不让剧目中还有任何淫猥、颓废、恐怖、落后的东西来毒害人民。我们的戏剧批评首先要做消毒的工作。但是，我们今天除了继续注意剧目的思想内容之外，同时要对导演的处理手法、演员的表演技巧以及舞台、音乐、美术方面的创造进行艺术的评论和分析。我们的伟大人民不能容忍政治思想内容有严重错误的剧目，但也不爱看政治上虽然没有什么大错，而艺术性十分低劣的东西，我们的人民要求政治与艺术高度结合的、形神具足的作品。我们的人民从来对于表演得好的演员们有很高的敬爱，也不埋没一切舞台工作者的劳绩。
    我们要虚心接受批评，也要保持高度警惕。有些人说我们的某些戏的艺术性不够，“干巴巴的”，他们要求我们加进一些所谓“人情味”。我们也不满足于缺乏艺术性的作品，毛泽东同志就说过：“缺乏艺术性的艺术品，无论政治上怎样进步，也是没有力量的”。但我们断然拒绝用资产阶级的“人情味”或是凑上一些黄色的腐朽的东西来添加所谓艺术性。我们是发愤图强的民族，我们乐观积极，艰苦朴素，这是我国人民的特色，我们的戏剧也要保持这种特色，决不能受资产阶级思想的腐蚀。我们的戏剧有许多是写抗日战争、解放战争、抗美援朝战争以及台澎金马的对敌斗争的，因此有些人说“你们的戏不错，可惜火药气太重了”。他们认为这样的戏在今天的和平年代是不受欢迎的。没有丧失嗅觉的中国戏剧家也能立刻感到这种说法的危害性，因为帝国主义虽在垂死阶段，它的侵略好战的本性是决不会改变的，我们丝毫也没有理由放松警惕。我们热爱和平，但不是和平主义者，我们反对帝国主义侵略战争，而支持一切反对帝国主义，争取民族独立、民主自由和社会主义的正义战争。我们的戏剧也将保持战斗传统，保持这种向敌人坚决斗争的“火药气”！
    此外，还有戏剧教育的大量发展，戏剧书刊出版机构的建立，国际戏剧文化交流的频繁等等。我们人民戏剧事业的成就是说不完道不尽的。这些成绩的获得，应该感谢党和毛主席，戏剧工作的每一胜利都是党和毛泽东同志英明的文艺思想的胜利！是文艺为工农兵服务的正确方向的胜利！是工农兵方向下百花齐放、百家争鸣和推陈出新的坚定的文艺方针的胜利！是毛泽东同志提出的革命的现实主义和革命的浪漫主义相结合的艺术方法的胜利！只要我们按照党和毛泽东同志所制定的方针、政策和方法奋步前进，我们是战无不胜、攻无不克的，我们工人阶级社会主义戏剧的前途是无限光明的！
    创作中的几个问题
    但是我们丝毫没有理由满足于已经获得的这些成就，我们的工作还存在一些问题。首先我们的创作和改编工作，无论质与量都还远不能满足今天人民和广大专业、业余戏剧团体日益高涨的要求。许多革命史上和革命现阶段的重要斗争，许多有功于人民的杰出人物和事迹还没有得到反映，或充分反映。许多前代和现代的戏剧艺术家的战斗经验、艺术经验还有待于进一步记录整理；我们的剧作家、表演艺术家们与劳动人民相结合、与生产劳动相结合还贯彻得不够普遍深入；我们的队伍的政治思想水平也还不平衡，现代修正主义和资产阶级思想也还有它们的市场；马克思主义的理论批评还不够活跃，队伍还不够壮大。这些缺点都有待我们急起直追，加以克服。
    这里我主要提出以下三个问题，供同志们讨论。
    塑造新的英雄人物问题
    我们正处在一个人民群众在改造世界中改造自己的伟大时代。劳动人民的共产主义风格迅速成长，恩格斯所说的“倔强的、叱咤风云的革命的无产者”到处涌现。以最大热情、最高技巧刻划这些英雄人物来教育人民、鼓舞人民，是我们戏剧工作者的光荣职责。我们各个剧种以不同的形式和风格反映了这个伟大时代，创造了工人、农民、战士、革命干部、革命知识分子的鲜明形象。还创作了一批历史题材的剧目，刻划了古代人民斗争中的杰出儿女，这对于今天人民也有极大的鼓舞作用。
    完成这个任务是有斗争的。首先是我们要不要写英雄人物？这应该是不成问题的。但，不，有问题！有人说：人类心灵是复杂的，有善有恶，有光明面有阴暗面，两者在灵魂深处不断地斗争着。因此天下不存在无“疵”的人，不存在真正足以供人效法的英雄人物。那些大公无私、舍己为人的具有共产主义道德品质的英雄形象，照他们看都是不真实的，不合乎“人性”的。似乎只有写那些内心动摇、人格分裂的人物才是真实的。这当然是企图瓦解我们士气的帝国主义文化帮凶们——现代修正主义者们的谬论。
    修正主义者的这种所谓“写真实”，只不过是借此为名，夸大新社会的个别缺点来攻击社会主义制度，攻击无产阶级。使他们不能不感到悲哀的是，今天只有无产阶级才能产生英雄人物，没落腐朽的资产阶级再也没有先进向上的道德力量了。因此，他们所能做的却是颠倒黑白，淆乱是非。如在英、美戏剧电影里把罢工工人的纠察队写成暴徒，而把破坏罢工的工贼写成英雄人物。这正如毛泽东同志说的：“反动时期的资产阶级文艺家把革命群众写成暴徒，把他们自己写成神圣，所谓光明和黑暗是颠倒的。”他们的另一种表现是虽不能不承认太阳的存在，却拼命在太阳里找黑斑，在新英雄人物身上找缺点。这样就可以证明“天下老鸦一般黑”，就可以根本否认世界上真有共产主义的崇高品质，这样对于保护资本主义是有好处的。我们并不一般地反对写英雄人物的缺点，而是认为必须把英雄人物在成长过程中的某些缺点、日常工作中的某些过失偏差和政治道德品质上的缺陷严格区别开来。倘使一个人虚伪自私，动摇妥协，那就只能是一个反面人物，不成什么英雄了。
    周扬同志在1953年第二次文代大会的时候曾号召我们表现社会主义时代的英雄人物，在第三次文代大会中又对我们作同样的号召。
    周扬同志认为革命艺术家应该塑造这种最能体现无产阶级革命理想的人物，通过这些革命的理想人物的形象，就可以感动千百万人把社会推向前进。
    这一号召之所以比以前更有力量，是因为毛泽东同志给了我们新的锐利的思想武器——革命的现实主义和革命的浪漫主义相结合的艺术方法。我们的革命的浪漫主义实质上就是革命的理想主义。我们的革命实践不断受着革命理想的指导和鼓舞，亿万革命人民为着实现自己所接受的共产主义崇高理想，蔑视任何艰苦困难，超越任何坎坷障碍，以万马奔腾之势向前迈进，不达目的不止，这一种伟大精神不是愚公移山、精卫填海之类所能比拟的。正因这样，中国才能在短短十一年间在各方面建设上，出现无数史无前例的奇迹。有人以为难于实现的理想，在我们则一个又一个地成为现实。可见我们的浪漫主义、理想主义不是外加的，而是主导的部分。只有这种共产主义的伟大理想和革命斗争的伟大现实，才能培育出这个时代的最崇高最优秀的人物。也只有这两者的结合，才能产生最崇高最优秀的作品。修正主义者极力贬低和磨灭我们的革命理想，而我们正是要高扬这种理想，保卫这种理想，为实现这种理想而艰苦奋斗，不挠不屈。现实主义创作方法因为与革命理想相结合才成为革命的现实主义，没有理想的现实主义就成为庸俗的自然主义和颓废主义。因此，我设想，一旦我们的表演、导演艺术和整个舞台艺术充分体现了毛泽东同志革命的现实主义和革命的浪漫主义相结合的精神，那就将发挥无比强大的生命力，放出前所未有的灿烂光芒。
    为了表现我们所处的这个无比壮丽的群众时代、英雄主义时代，只能用豪迈的而不是阴郁的语言；只能用雄壮高昂而不是低沉的调子；只能用鲜明而不是灰暗的色采；只能用革命的浪漫主义和革命的现实主义相结合的艺术方法而不是琐碎的自然主义手法。检查一下我们过去所习用的艺术方法，也还是存在着一些阴郁的、低沉的、灰暗的、琐碎的自然主义的东西。为着更恰当地表现新的时代新的英雄人物，我们应该把这些东西加以扬弃。那样我们的人民舞台就会出现新生面！
    如何正确对待和处理戏剧的矛盾冲突
    毛泽东同志说：“矛盾不断出现，又不断解决，就是事物发展的辩证规律”，这也是戏剧创造的辩证规律——“没有冲突就没有戏剧”。
    当我们提到塑造伟大时代的英雄形象的时候，就不可避免地要接触到矛盾冲突问题。因为我们这伟大的时代是一个战斗的时代，是充满着内外矛盾的时代，它首先存在着中国人民和帝国主义及其奴仆的尖锐的敌我矛盾，同时还存在一系列的人民内部矛盾。我们的英雄们谁也不是在暖房中培养出来的，不，他们全都在翻天复地的斗争风暴中经受着锻炼。他们在和旧思想、旧事物的斗争中、在和一切违反人民利益的反面现象斗争中显示了自己作为这伟大时代的先进分子的新思想、新品质。倘使在塑造这些英雄人物的时候回避生活中的缺点和困难，缩小或抹杀它的对立面，略去尖锐的矛盾斗争，只是孤立渲染他的胜利和功绩，那么无论你费多少笔墨，这个英雄人物还是苍白无力的。
    有些人不承认社会主义制度下还存在人民内部矛盾。他们硬说在我们生活中间只有好与更好的差别，只有先进与后进的差别，有的人甚至说现在只有人与自然间的矛盾，人与人之间不存在任何矛盾了。因此戏剧作品中很难反映生动真实的社会矛盾，只能依靠人为的方法找戏剧冲突了。有的人则认为“没有冲突就没有戏剧”的说法是应该抛弃的资产阶级戏剧家过了时的论调。
    产生这种“无冲突论”的根源，是由于他们脱离生活，看不见生活中存在的矛盾，也不懂得对立统一的规律。毛泽东同志说：“许多人不承认社会主义社会还有矛盾，因而使得他们在社会矛盾面前缩手缩脚，处于被动地位；不懂得在不断地正确处理和解决矛盾的过程中，将会使社会主义社会内部的统一和团结日益巩固”。少数剧作家在作品中只着力渲染生活气氛和一些表面现象，不敢去接触生活本质，回避生活中的矛盾冲突，因而使人物形象暗淡，思想软弱无力。有的同志也不是有意回避矛盾冲突而是看不出矛盾冲突。他们不知道“没有什么事物是不包含矛盾的，没有矛盾就没有世界。”问题只在我们是不是善于去观察和分析各种事物的矛盾。这些没有写出矛盾斗争的同志不一定都是“无冲突论者”，但他们不能通过深刻的观察，把生活中的矛盾斗争典型化，却是无可讳言的。
    “无冲突论”实际上是在散播阶级斗争熄灭论，他们企图使我们忘记在我们国家里还存在无产阶级和资产阶级、社会主义和资本主义两条道路的斗争，这种斗争在整个过渡时期都是不可避免的，只是像波浪一样有时低，有时高，有时缓和，有时尖锐。这种斗争要到资产阶级政治影响思想影响最后肃清的时候才能熄灭。
    另一方面修正主义者夸大和歪曲我们人民内部的矛盾。就是前面提过的他们在“写真实”的幌子下贩卖暴露新社会“阴暗面”的、不可告人的黑货。他们对我们国家内还存在的社会主义和资本主义两条道路的斗争避而不谈，却故意地说：我们社会矛盾主要是群众个人利益和国家集体利益之间的矛盾；领导干部官僚作风和群众利益的矛盾；工作人员命令主义和群众生产积极性、创造性的矛盾。他们冷嘲热讽地把歌颂新社会的作品称为“粉饰现实”，他们提倡暴露新社会的阴暗面，说这才符合“批判的现实主义”传统。也有某些修正主义者由于我们不提倡写新社会的所谓“阴暗面”，竟反而诬蔑我们是“无冲突论者”，那只是暴露他们作为帝国主义奴仆的可耻的阴谋罢了。他们的用心无非要求给予温度和湿度，以培养修正主义毒草，让他们毫无“主客观束缚”地反党、反社会主义。当然他们的妄想是不会得逞的。
    我们说社会主义和资本主义这两条道路的斗争是今天国内的主要矛盾，而生活中的主要矛盾也必然在戏剧中反映出来。但并非说一切作品都非表现这个矛盾不可。我们反对修正主义者把领导和被领导的矛盾说成是今天的主要矛盾，这是因为它不符合事实，这是修正主义者耍的障眼法，其目的在于保护资产阶级，攻击无产阶级。
    人民的生活本来是丰富多彩的，反映人民生活的文学艺术当然也应该丰富多彩。我们提倡写主要矛盾，但也欢迎写任何有现实意义的其他矛盾。我们的目的只在帮助新的战胜旧的。我们要热情地歌颂新思想，新事物，鞭挞旧思想，旧事物；塑造光芒万丈的无产阶级和劳动人民的英雄形象去战胜一切缺点和困难，战胜一切衰朽落后的事物，替共产主义新生活开辟道路。
    如何继承和革新中外戏剧传统
    关于吸收和改造中国自己的传统戏剧，十一年来我们已经取得了巨大成就。这在前面已经说过了。这里再补充三点：第一，我们对中国戏剧文化传统还缺乏全面的历史的估价。中国戏剧艺术有它的独特风格和传统精神，我们一定要从内容到形式把它的规律和特点加以科学的概括，充分掌握它的积极的、革命的精神。
    第二，我们以拥有如此丰富的遗产而自豪。但在长期封建社会中发展起来的戏剧文化的灿烂花朵中含有芳香，也含有毒素。我们只能使丰富遗产成为帮助我们前进的东西，而不是让它成为阻碍我们前进的沉重包袱。我们又继承，又抛弃，即继承传统中的精华，而抛弃其中的糟粕。我们既不能把精华糟粕无批判地兼收并蓄，更不能像现代修正主义者那样，吸收其糟粕而抛弃其精华！
    第三，我们是马克思主义者，我们是过去一切有价值的东西的继承者，也是新的美好事物的创造者。我们要一面继承传统，一面坚决在传统基础上进行革新，创造新形式。这样，才能适应新的群众时代的需要。
    在文化遗产中，也包含着十九世纪的欧洲戏剧。“五四”运动初期，资产阶级教授们盲目崇拜欧美文化，对民族戏曲遗产鄙夷备至，主张完全用欧洲式的话剧来代替旧戏。后来，修正主义分子包括反革命分子胡风一派也对民族传统一笔抹煞，却对十九世纪欧洲资产阶级文艺戏剧五体投地，认为那是人道主义、现实主义的典范，世界文化的高峰，他们抬起这些外国菩萨来和革命文艺、革命戏剧争群众。十九世纪的欧洲出现过许多资产阶级民主主义的文艺大师，他们曾用自己的文艺武器替封建压迫和宗教桎梏下的人民争过人权、自由和个性解放，他们的批判精神和艺术上的一些成就是不能抹煞的，仍值得我们借鉴。但他们受着阶级的局限，只能以资产阶级民主主义、改良主义、人道主义的立场对旧社会进行批判。易卜生就是这样。欧洲近代剧这份遗产对我国戏曲界关系较少，对我国话剧工作者影响较深，写《易卜生主义》的胡适就曾无耻地利用易卜生宣传资产阶级个人主义。半世纪以来欧洲戏剧大师们的作品和理论流入中国的不少，也各有他们的崇拜者、追随者，应当从好坏两方面检查一下我们所受的影响。这些艺术家的作品有的对当时起过很好的作用，对今天也还有一定意义。有的对今天人民已经失去意义，甚至有害。我们应该对他们批判地进行学习。是不是批判就妨碍学习呢？恰恰相反，只有认真地学习才能科学地进行批判，也只有经过科学的批判清除资产阶级个人主义之类的毒菌才能学习得更好，才能充分吸收他们的一切有益的东西。
          我们今后的任务
    十一年来，特别是大跃进以来，在党的领导下，全体戏剧工作者忘我劳动，积极创造，取得了巨大的成就和丰富的经验。我们是以马克思列宁主义武装起来的戏剧工作者。我们高举着毛泽东思想的旗帜。我们从不以现有的成绩自满。面对祖国建设的伟大目标，我们必须鼓足干劲、力争上游、为工人阶级戏剧事业作出更大的贡献。
    我们必须坚决贯彻毛泽东同志文艺为工农兵服务的正确方向和这一方向下的百花齐放、百家争鸣，推陈出新的政策；必须加强党对戏剧工作的领导，坚持政治挂帅的原则，系统深入地学习马克思列宁主义和毛泽东同志著作；经常保持警惕，随时随地和资产阶级思想，修正主义思想进行不调和的斗争，保护我们戏剧艺术和戏剧队伍的政治思想纯洁性。我们要大力发展戏剧创作，以高度的思想性、艺术性创作出无愧于我们伟大时代的剧作，塑造具有崇高的共产主义道德品质的新的英雄形象，以打动千百万人民的心灵，推动祖国社会主义建设前进，并为培养共产主义新人作出贡献。
    在接受遗产问题上，批判地继承民族和民间的优秀艺术传统，学习外国的优秀艺术经验，进一步革新戏剧艺术，促进话剧、歌剧、舞剧进一步民族化和群众化；在剧本、表演、导演、舞台美术、音乐各方面都要不断改进，精益求精和具备鲜明的民族特色。进一步革新戏曲和木偶、皮影、杂技艺术，发扬艺术上的首创精神。
    要做好这些工作，必须提高和壮大理论批评队伍，发展富于战斗性创造性的理论批评，浇香花，锄毒草，在毛泽东文艺思想指导下积极地细致地推动创作，指导创作，并和剧作家，表演、导演艺术家，舞台美术家，音乐家一道总结我国戏剧艺术的丰富经验，为创立中国自己的马克思主义演剧体系而努力。同时也要加强中国戏剧家协会和各省市自治区戏剧家协会分会的工作，团结全体戏剧工作者，用自我教育的方法，实现上述任务，使戏剧家协会的组织成为党领导下的最活跃的战斗单位之一。
    党期待我们用更大的胜利迎接新的伟大的年代。让我们高举毛泽东的红旗，争分夺秒地投入新的战斗吧！
