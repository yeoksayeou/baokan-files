Biography of Comrade Wilhelm Pieck

Wilhelm Pieck, President of the German Democratic Republic, is a renowned activist in the German and world workers' movement, and one of the founders and leaders of the German Communist Party and the Socialist Unity Party of Germany.

Pieck was born on January 3, 1876, in Guben (south of Frankfurt an der Oder) to a working-class family. In his youth, he was an excellent carpenter. In 1894, Pieck began to participate in the revolutionary German workers' movement and joined the German Social Democratic Party the following year. From 1896, Pieck served as a staff member of the Social Democratic Party and trade union organizations in Bremen, where he led workers' strikes. Pieck's high level of activity and creativity in the workers' movement earned him the trust of the party and trade union organizations in Bremen. In 1906, Pieck was elected secretary of the local party organization in Bremen, and under his leadership, the local party organization greatly developed.

Pieck stood with the leaders of the Social Democratic left wing, the outstanding fighters of the German proletariat, Liebknecht, Luxemburg, Zetkin, and others, and resolutely opposed the opportunist policies of the leading organs of the Social Democratic Party at various party congresses. In 1910, Pieck served as the second secretary of the Central Education Committee of the Party, specializing in the work of the party school.

During the First World War from 1914 to 1918, Pieck waged a tenacious struggle against the war policy of German imperialism and against the treacherous behavior of right-wing Social Democratic leaders who supported the imperialist war. He delivered speeches against the imperialist war in the party, trade union, and youth organizations.

On May 28, 1915, Pieck, entrusted by the left wing of the Social Democratic Party, organized the first peace demonstration of the German people. Pieck was arrested in the demonstration and sent to the front line after five months of imprisonment. In the army, Pieck continued to carry out anti-war propaganda. In January 1918, Pieck took up residence in the Netherlands, where he participated in the work of the magazine "Struggle," the organ of German political exiles. Pieck published articles in the magazine, calling on German workers to learn from the example of Russian workers, overthrow the war government, and establish a worker-peasant regime in Germany.

Pieck actively participated in the struggle to overthrow the government of Kaiser Wilhelm in 1918. Together with Liebknecht, he carried out revolutionary agitation among German workers and soldiers. At the end of 1918, the left wing in the Social Democratic Party established the German Communist Party. Pieck was elected as a member of the Central Committee. Pieck was also an active member of the Communist International, and from 1931 onwards he served as a member of the Presidium and Secretary of the Secretariat of the Executive Committee of the Communist International.

At the Brussels Conference of the German Communist Party in 1935, Pieck was elected Chairman of the Central Committee of the German Communist Party to replace Thälmann, who had been arrested by Hitler.

During the period from 1941 to 1945, Pieck supported the Soviet Union's just war against fascist Germany. He believed that the victory of the Soviet Union would guarantee the liberation of the German people from Hitler's tyranny. After Hitler's Germany was crushed by the Soviet army, Pieck returned to Berlin. He gathered the members of the German Communist Party and began the arduous post-war reconstruction work on the ruins of the war. In 1946, the Communist Party and the Social Democratic Party in eastern Germany carried out a historic merger to form the Socialist Unity Party of Germany. Pieck made great efforts for the unification of these two parties. After the Socialist Unity Party was formed, Pieck and Grotewohl jointly served as chairmen of the party.

After the establishment of the German Democratic Republic in October 1949, Pieck was elected as president. He led the people of the Republic in a selfless struggle to defend peace and consolidate and develop the first worker-peasant state in German history. Due to his great contributions to the Republic, Pieck was awarded the title of "Hero of Labor" and the first-class "Fatherland Merit" Medal.

For more than sixty years, Pieck's glorious struggle for the liberation of the German people and for the cause of peace and democracy in Germany has been infinitely admired by the working people of Germany and the world. His boundless loyalty to the proletarian cause and the Party, his love for the people, and his lofty internationalist spirit have set a great example for all those who are fighting for peace, democracy, and socialism.
