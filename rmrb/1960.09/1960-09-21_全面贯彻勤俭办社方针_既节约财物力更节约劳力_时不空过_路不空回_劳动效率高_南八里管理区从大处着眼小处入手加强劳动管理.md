According to the Shanxi Daily, Jia Linmao, director, and Zhao Guofu, accountant, of the Nanbali Management Area of Weiyuan Commune in Zuoyun County, are called "Reassuring Director" and "Reliable Accountant" by the commune members, not only because they are meticulous in economic expenditures and pay attention to savings, but also because they pay great attention to saving labor in the use of labor power.
    Last autumn, one day after threshing, commune member Zhao Guosi said to Captain Mi Xi, "Let's repair the flails used for threshing! It will save us from buying new ones next year." The captain was happy and gave him a day. This was supposed to be a great thing, but Jia Linmao was a little dissatisfied when he found out. He felt that repairing these flails should only take half a day, and giving him a day would obviously be wasting half a day's work! After Jia Linmao and Zhao Guofu studied this matter, they believed that failing to pay attention to saving labor was a stumbling block to further implementing the policy of running communes diligently and frugally. He promptly educated the cadres and commune members: Grain is grown by crops, and crops are planted by people. Therefore, the problem of saving ultimately comes down to saving labor. To further draw the attention of cadres and commune members, they also calculated the following account for everyone: Last year, the total grain output of the entire management area was 625,100 catties, and agricultural labor was 41,000 workdays, averaging 15 catties of grain produced per workday; the total income was 74,968 yuan, and the total labor was 52,300 workdays, averaging 1.40 yuan of income produced per workday. This calculation shocked people. Production Captain Mi Xi said, "So much is lost by wasting one workday. We must pay attention to saving labor in the future." From which aspects should we pay attention to saving labor? Their experience can be summarized as follows:
    First, they grasped the principle of "no time wasted, no trip in vain." Take planting Chinese yams, for example. According to local custom, one ox-team had to be followed by one person to fetch manure and one to plant, and these two people had to walk back empty-handed every time they plowed a furrow. In response to this loophole, Jia Linmao studied and adopted the method of using two ox-teams plowing one after the other. In this way, each manure fetcher and planter could supply two ox-teams, without taking a single empty step. This alone saved the entire management area 485 workdays this year. Using donkeys to transport manure is also a major agricultural task here. In previous years, two people drove six donkeys, and another person in the village had to be responsible for picking up manure and loading the packs. Once the donkey packs left, the manure loader was idle. When the donkey packs returned, the donkey drivers were idle again. After Jia Linmao and Zhao Guofu took the lead in adopting the method of two people driving six donkeys, loading the manure themselves, and doing the work themselves, one person could be saved for every three people. This spring alone, the entire area saved 223 manure transport workers. They also paid attention to organizing various professional teams to serve agricultural production using fragmented time. For example, they figured out the busy and idle patterns of each professional team: when there was dew in the morning, the cattle, sheep, and pig herders could not go to the slopes, so they were asked to spend one to three hours each day doing farm work; the cooks had less to do for breakfast and dinner, so they were asked to spend one to two hours each afternoon doing farm work. From January to August this year alone, the area's 25 herdsmen and cooks contributed 1,960 workdays to agriculture.
    Reasonable allocation of labor is also a very complex and important task. This spring, Jia Linmao discovered in the animal husbandry team that the 12 breeders were all experienced plowmen, but every day after the cattle teams went out to the slopes, they would sweep the pens, carry soil, and sift grass, and then have nothing to do in the afternoon. On the other hand, the sowing team lacked skilled labor who knew how to plow due to the increase in cattle teams. Therefore, they transferred these experienced plowmen to plow the land, and divided the cattle by team, unified for them to use and feed. This not only gave play to the technical expertise of the experienced plowmen in plowing and feeding, but also added 12 strong soldiers to the agricultural front. Back in the autumn of 1958, Jia Linmao had individually reviewed the use of each labor force in the entire area, and also launched a mass debate on this issue. At that time, 75-year-old Su Danv said to Jia Linmao, "Uncle Jia! My legs and feet are not good, but these two hands of mine can't be idle. Why don't you give us old women the job of peeling hemp!" Jia Linmao discussed it with Zhao Guofu and believed that this was indeed a loophole in wasting labor, so they adopted the method of delivering the work to the door, assigning tasks within their capabilities to 24 old women and men in the entire area. As a result, last year these 24 elderly people did more than 1,900 more workdays than in 1958.
    In agricultural production, "the weather" often causes trouble. What was originally arranged very well, a heavy rain will disrupt your arrangement. If there is no second arrangement in advance, then most of the labor will have to be wasted for a day. Jia Linmao and Zhao Guofu adopted a two-pronged approach, turning passivity into initiative. Smearing houses is a non-productive labor that must be done every year in rural areas, and the entire area has to spend more than 1,000 workdays on it every year. This year, the method of mixing mud in heavy rain and smearing houses in light rain was adopted, breaking the task of smearing houses into smaller pieces, making full use of fragmented time, which is equivalent to completely saving the smearing house labor. Taking out manure from the pens is also a labor-intensive task. This year, the method of digging in the pens in heavy rain, carrying it out in light rain, and chasing after it in the fields when the rain stops was adopted, which saved a large number of workers. In rainy weather, in addition to drawing some labor to do the above work, the remaining labor is used to weave and repair farm tools. In this way, this year, all rainy days have been turned into sunny days.
    The Nanbali Management Area has comprehensively implemented the policy of running communes diligently and frugally, and production has grown at a high speed year by year: the total grain output in 1958 doubled that of 1957, and the total grain output in 1959 increased by another 10% compared with 1958.

    全面贯彻勤俭办社方针　既节约财物力更节约劳力
    时不空过　路不空回　劳动效率高
　　南八里管理区从大处着眼小处入手加强劳动管理
    据山西日报消息　左云县威远公社南八里管理区的主任贾林茂和会计赵国富，所以被社员称为“放心主任”和“保险会计”，不仅因为他们在经济开支上会精打细算，注意节约，而且还因为他们在劳动力的使用上，也非常注意节约。
    去年秋后，有一天打完场，社员赵国四对队长米喜说：“咱们把打场用的梿枷修理一下吧！省得明年再买新的。”队长一高兴给了他一天时间。按说这是一件大好事情，可是贾林茂知道了却有点不大满意。他觉得：修理这些梿枷有半天时间就足够用了，要给他一天工夫，这不是明摆着要窝半天工吗！贾林茂和赵国富就这件事情研究以后认为：不注意节约活劳动，是影响进一步贯彻勤俭办社方针的一块绊脚石。他就在干部和社员当中及时地进行了教育：粮食是庄稼长的，庄稼可是人们种下的。因此，节约问题归根到底还是个节约劳动力。为了进一步引起干部和社员们的注意，他们还给大家算了这样一笔账：去年全管理区的粮食总产量是六十二万五千一百斤，农业用工是四万一千个，平均每个工生产粮食十五斤；总收入是七万四千九百六十八元，总用工是五万二千三百个，平均一个工生产收入一元四角。这么一算，使人们大吃了一惊。生产队长米喜说：“原来浪费一个工就有这么大的损失，以后可得注意节约劳动力哩。”究竟应该从那些方面去注意节约劳动力呢？他们的经验归纳起来有以下几条：
    他们首先是抓住了“时不空过，路不空回。”就拿种山药来说，按照当地的习惯，是一犋牛就要跟一个人抓粪、一个点种，每耕一个来回这两个人就要空走一趟。针对这个漏洞，贾林茂研究出采取两犋牛前后套耕的办法。这样，每一个抓粪的和点种的都能供两犋牛，一步也不空走。光这一项，全管理区今年就节省了四百八十五个工。用毛驴送粪也是这里的一项主要农活，往年两个人赶六头毛驴，村子里还得另有一个人专管起粪、装驮子。驴驮子一走，装粪的就闲下了。驴驮子一回来，赶驴的人又闲下了。贾林茂和赵国富带头采取两个人赶六头驴，自己装粪、自打自唱的办法以后，每三个人中就可以节省出一个人。仅今年春天，全区就节省了送粪工二百二十三个。他们还注意组织各种专业队利用零碎时间，为农业生产服务。例如，他们摸清各专业队的忙闲规律：在早晨有露水，牛、羊、猪倌不能出坡，就让他们每天抽一至三小时干农活；炊事员早晚两顿饭比较省事，就让他们每天下午抽一至二小时干农活。仅今年1至8月份，全区的二十五个牧工和炊事员，就在农业上投了一千九百六十个劳动日。
    合理的调配劳动力，也是一件十分复杂而又重要的工作。今年春天，贾林茂在畜牧专业队发现十二名饲养员，都是些会耕地的老把式，可是每天牛犋一出坡，他们就去干扫圈、担土、筛草等营生，到下午就没事干了。而另一方面，播种作业组却由于牛犋增加，缺少会耕地的技术劳力。于是，他们就把这些老把式调去耕地，将牛按犋分开，统一由他们使用和饲养。这样，既发挥了老把式耕地、饲养的技术特长，又给农业战线上增加了十二名强兵。还是在1958年秋天，贾林茂就曾经逐个审查了全区每个劳力的使用情况，并且还就这一问题，发动群众进行了鸣放。当时，七十五岁的苏大女对贾林茂说：“他贾叔！我这腿脚不利索，这两只手可闲不住呀，你把剥麻的事交给我们这些老婆婆吧！”贾林茂跟赵国富一商量，认为这确是个浪费劳力的漏洞，就采取了把营生送上门的办法，给全区二十四名老婆老汉，分配了力所能及的活计。结果，去年一年这二十四名老人，就比1958年多做了一千九百多个工。
    在农业生产中，“老天爷”经常找麻烦。原来安排的很好，一场大雨就会把你的安排打乱。如果事先没有第二套安排，那么大部分劳力就得白白窝一天工。贾林茂和赵国富采取了两套安排的对策，变被动为主动。抹房子是农村年年必须做的非生产劳动，全区每年都要在这上面投放一千多个劳动日。今年采取了大雨和泥，小雨抹房的办法，把抹房子的活化整为零，充分利用零碎时间，就等于全部节约了抹房工。出圈粪也是一项占用劳力很多的活计，今年采取了大雨圈里挖、小雨往外担、雨停地里追的办法，又节约了很大一批工。在雨天，除抽一部分劳力干以上活外，下余劳力就编织和修理农具。这样，今年就把全部雨天变成了晴天用。
    南八里管理区全面贯彻执行了勤俭办社方针，生产逐年高速度地增长：1958年的粮食总产量比1957年增长了整一倍，1959年的粮食总产量，又比1958年增长了10％。（附图片）
