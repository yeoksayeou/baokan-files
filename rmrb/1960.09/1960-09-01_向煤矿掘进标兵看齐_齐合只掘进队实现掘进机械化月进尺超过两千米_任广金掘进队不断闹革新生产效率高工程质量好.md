Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, 31st. The Qihe Only Youth Fast Tunneling Team of the Chenjiazhuang Coal Mine in Hebi City, Henan Province, has consistently achieved a monthly advance of over two thousand meters in tunneling dry coal roadways in May, June, and July of this year. Calculated by workload, they have already entered 1964, three years ahead of schedule.

The Qihe Only Tunneling Team was established in November 1957. At that time, the entire team had only two sixth-grade workers. The average seniority of the team's workers was less than three years, and the average age was less than twenty-three years. However, they were highly motivated and dared to create. In 1958, all team members overcame the difficulties brought about by new ventures, new workers, and new equipment, and created the "Five-Pointed Star" and "Four-Door Dou" methods of drilling and slotting, which increased the daily tunneling advance from 2.4 meters to 14.5 meters, sounding the horn for a great leap forward in tunneling work throughout the city. In 1959, this team achieved a record of over one thousand meters per month in dry mining for five consecutive times, and the annual advance exceeded ten thousand meters, completing two years' worth of work in one year. Since 1960, the entire team has been determined to capture "double thousands of meters" (monthly advance). Through continuous technological innovation, they finally created a new national record of 2013.7 meters for single-hole dry coal roadway advancement in May. In June and July, they reached even greater heights, with monthly advances reaching as high as 2,300 meters to over 2,400 meters.

The rapid tunneling achievements of the Qihe Only Tunneling Team are inseparable from their vigorous technological innovation and the realization of mechanized tunneling. Since the beginning of this year, this team has successively created and promoted more than 20 new machines and tools, such as small belt conveyors, coal shoveling and transportation dual-purpose machines, pillar cutting machines, pillar socket digging machines, and canopy erection machines, as well as dozens of new technologies such as deep-hole blasting and millisecond blasting, realizing mechanized tunneling. The realization of mechanized tunneling has greatly improved work efficiency and freed workers from heavy physical labor. The total number of team members has been reduced from 96 to 41, and the tunneling process has been reduced from eight to four, reducing the cycle time for each step of drilling, support, and transportation from two hours to forty or fifty minutes, and as little as thirty-five minutes.

The Qihe Only Team has also promoted "four-eight" cross-operation and implemented the "five major personnel" management system based on the team's specific conditions, establishing cost accountants, specification acceptance personnel, tool keepers, safety inspectors, and planning administrators in each group. The implementation of this system has closely integrated collective concern for production with the individual responsibility system. The workers of this advanced tunneling team strictly abide by operating procedures, and do everything possible to reduce or eliminate accidents, achieving two years and ten months of safe, high-yield, and accident-free production. In order to constantly strive for the top, all four groups in the team are as united as one, giving way to each other when it comes to honor, and stepping up when there are difficulties, never letting a single group or individual fall behind. Some time ago, the Zhang Yongsheng group was lagging behind in production due to lack of experience, so the Dai Jinxiu group helped them improve their drilling and canopy support, improving the tunneling efficiency of the Zhang Yongsheng group. In order to overcome the difficulties of low technical skills among new workers, this team has insisted on everyone studying culture and everyone mastering technology for three years, and all forty-one workers in the team have now improved from illiteracy to elementary school or higher education.

Recently, the Henan Provincial Coal Industry Bureau systematically summarized and promoted the advanced experience of the Qihe Only Tunneling Team, and decided to launch a high tide of rapid tunneling across the province, calling to "learn from Qihe Only, catch up with Qihe Only". In addition, twelve provinces including Hebei and Liaoning, and more than forty mining bureaus such as the Fushun Mining Bureau, have also sent people to study the experience of the Qihe Only team.

Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, 31st. The Ren Guangjin Youth Tunneling Team of the Tangjiazhuang Mine of Kailuan Coal Mine achieved an average monthly tunneling advance of 1,440.5 meters from January to July this year, with a maximum of 2,187 meters. All engineering specifications and quality were qualified, making it a red flag for rapid tunneling on the coal industry front in Hebei Province. Currently, coal mine workers throughout the province are launching a mass movement to learn from, compare with, catch up with, and surpass the Ren Guangjin Youth Tunneling Team.

As early as February of this year, the Ren Guangjin Tunneling Team responded to the call of the Party Committee and proposed a leap forward target of 1,800 meters per month. At that time, the biggest key to achieving this target was that the drill bits for drilling blasting holes were short, the amount of explosives was small, and the blasting force was weak. In order to solve this key problem, they first lengthened the drill bits of the electric drills from 1.5 meters to 3 meters with the help of the Party branch, administrative cadres, and technical personnel, which doubled the tunneling efficiency. After the success of the three-meter-long drill bit drilling method, they boldly innovated the slotting and blasting techniques, shortening the time for drilling a round of blasting holes from thirty minutes to ten minutes, and increasing the advance efficiency by about two times.

As the tunneling speed increased, the work of supporting canopies could not keep up, which affected the further improvement of tunneling efficiency. The team members spent a lot of effort to overcome this key problem. As a result, with the enthusiastic help of administrative personnel, technical personnel, and veteran workers, they quickly created pillar socket digging machines and pillar head sawing machines, eliminating the physical labor of manual pillar socket digging and manual pillar head sawing that had existed for many years, and increasing work efficiency by nine times. In addition, they also improved the canopy support method, reducing the time for supporting a canopy from the previous twenty minutes to four or five minutes.

Fully utilizing the space and time underground is also an important factor for this team to improve tunneling efficiency. They changed the past pipeline operation to "four parallel operations," reducing the twelve processes of drilling, support, and blasting to four processes. In this way, the operation time for each cycle was shortened from the original sixty-six minutes to thirty-eight minutes.

The Ren Guangjin Tunneling Team has a total of three shifts, and they are very united and cooperate well, creating favorable conditions for each other in production. When changing shifts, no matter which shift the team members belong to, they always make all production preparations for the next shift. However, when it comes to competing in enthusiasm and production, no one wants to fall behind. They said: "Anything can be given way to, but there is one thing that absolutely cannot be given way to - not giving way to revolution, not giving way to advance." (Attached picture)

    向煤矿掘进标兵看齐
    齐合只掘进队实现掘进机械化月进尺超过两千米
    任广金掘进队不断闹革新生产效率高工程质量好
    据新华社郑州31日电　河南省鹤壁市陈家庄煤矿齐合只青年快速掘进队，在今年5、6、7三个月中掘进旱采煤巷，连续达到单孔月进两千米以上。按工作量计算，他们已提前三年跨入了1964年。
    齐合只掘进队是1957年11月成立的。当时全队只有两名六级工。全队工人的平均工龄不足三年，平均年龄不到二十三岁。但是，他们干劲足，勇于创造，全体队员1958年战胜了新摊子、新工人、新设备所带来的困难，创造了“五角星”“四门斗”打眼、掏槽的方法，使掘进日进尺由二点四米猛升到十四点五米，在全市吹响了掘进工作大跃进号角。1959年，这个队又连续五次达到月进旱采千米的纪录，全年进尺突破万米关，一年干了两年活。1960年以来，全队又决心智夺“双千米”（月进尺）。经过不断革新技术，他们终于在5月份创造了旱采煤巷单孔二千零一十三点七米的全国最新纪录。6、7两月更上一层楼，月进尺分别高达二千三百米到二千四百多米。
    齐合只掘进队的快速掘进成就是同他们大搞技术革新、实现掘进机械化分不开的。今年以来，这个队先后创造和推广了小型皮带运输机、攉煤和运输两用机、砍柱机、挖柱窝机、架棚机等二十多种新机具，以及深孔爆破、毫秒爆破等数十种新技术，实现了掘进机械化。掘进机械化的实现，大大提高了工效，使工人解脱了笨重的体力劳动。全队队员已由九十六人减少到四十一人，掘进工序由八道减为四道，打眼、支架、运输每一个循环时间从二小时降低到四、五十分钟，最少到三十五分钟。
    齐合只队还根据本队的具体情况，推行了“四八”交叉作业和实行了“五大员”管理制度，在每个小组设立了成本核算员、规格验收员、工具保管员、安全检查员、计划管理员。实行这一制度，使集体关心生产与专人负责制紧密结合了起来。这个先进掘进队的工人，个个严守操作规程，千方百计减少或杜绝事故，做到两年零十个月安全高产无事故。为了永争上游，全队四个组团结得像一个人一样，组与组之间见荣誉就让，见困难就上，决不叫一个组、一个人掉队。前些时，张永生组因缺乏经验，生产赶不上去，戴金秀组就帮助他们改进打眼、扶棚，提高了张永生组的掘进效率。这个队为了克服新工人技术低的困难，三年如一日地坚持人人学文化，个个钻技术，全队四十一名工人现在已从文盲提高到小学以上文化程度。
    最近，河南省煤炭工业局，系统地总结推广了齐合只掘进队的先进经验，确定在全省掀起一个“学齐合只，赶齐合只”的快速掘进高潮。此外，河北、辽宁等十二个省和抚顺矿务局等四十多个矿务局，也同时派人来学习了齐合只队的经验。
    据新华社天津31日电　开滦煤矿唐家庄矿任广金青年掘进队今年1至7月份平均月掘进进尺达一千四百四十点五米，最高达二千一百八十七米，工程规格质量全部合格，成为河北省煤炭工业战线上一面快速掘进的红旗。目前，全省煤矿职工正在开展一个学、比、赶、超任广金青年掘进队的群众运动。
    任广金掘进队在今年2月就响应党委的号召，提出月进一千八百米的跃进指标。当时实现这一指标最大的关键是打炮眼的钎子短、装药少、爆破力小。为了解决这个关键，他们首先在党支部、行政干部和技术人员的帮助下，把电钻的钎子由一点五米加长到三米，掘进效率提高了一倍。三米长钎子打眼的方法试验成功以后，他们又对掏槽和爆破的技术进行了大胆的革新，使打一茬炮眼的时间由三十分钟缩短到十分钟，进尺效率提高了二倍左右。
    掘进速度加快了，支架棚子的活又赶不上了，影响了掘进效率的进一步提高。为了攻破这个关键，队员们花费了许多心血。结果他们又在行政人员、技术人员和老工人的热情帮助下，很快就创制出了挖柱窝机和锯柱头机，消灭了多少年来的人力挖柱窝和人力锯柱头的体力劳动，工效提高了九倍。另外，他们还改进了支架的方法，使支一架棚子的时间由过去的二十分钟减少到四、五分钟。
    充分地利用井下的空间和时间，也是这个队提高掘进效率的重要因素。他们把过去按流水作业改为“四平行作业”，使打眼、支架、放炮等十二道工序，减少为四道工序。这样，每个循环的作业时间由原来的六十六分钟，缩短到三十八分钟。
    任广金掘进队共有三个班，他们三个班拧成一股绳，协作得很好，生产上互相创造有利条件。换班的时候，无论哪个班的队员，总是要给下一班作好一切生产准备。可是，比干劲、比生产，却是谁也不甘落后。他们说：“什么也可以让，有一样绝对不能让——革命不让人，进尺不让人。”（附图片）
