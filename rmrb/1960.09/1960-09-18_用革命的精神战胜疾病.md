Use Revolutionary Spirit to Conquer Disease
This article, "Use Revolutionary Spirit to Conquer Disease," is based on a speech given by Comrade Deng Yingchao on August 20, 1960, at a report meeting organized by the Beijing Tuberculosis Prevention and Treatment Institute, addressed to tuberculosis patients undergoing comprehensive rapid treatment using integrated Chinese and Western medicine. Recently, the "Health News" and "Chinese Women" magazines have published this speech. We believe that this speech is not only helpful for tuberculosis patients and those suffering from other diseases, but also has educational significance for general readers on how to use revolutionary spirit to overcome difficulties. Therefore, we reprint it here. The subtitles within the text are added by the editors.　　　　　　　　　　　——Editor

Now, I would like to share my experiences in fighting diseases, including tuberculosis, and how I used revolutionary spirit to conquer disease. The magazines "Mass Tuberculosis Prevention" and "China Youth" have previously published some information about my experiences in this regard, so I won't repeat it here. I will focus on four main points for your reference.

Tuberculosis Can Definitely Be Cured

Tuberculosis can be cured, and it certainly can be cured. Why? Because many tuberculosis patients have been cured, and my tuberculosis has also been cured, which proves it. Moreover, past environmental conditions were far from comparable to the present. With such good conditions now, as long as patients demonstrate subjective initiative and revolutionary optimism, grasp the causes, nature, and patterns of the disease, and cooperate with necessary treatment conditions such as drug therapy, physical exercise, and appropriate labor and recreational activities, they can recover. What's more, our country now has the superiority of the socialist system, which brings superior conditions for disease treatment; the progress of medical science, the improvement of medical and recuperation conditions, especially the recently promoted comprehensive rapid treatment method combining Chinese and Western medicine, can not only cure tuberculosis, but also cure it quickly in a short period of time.

The comprehensive treatment method combining Chinese and Western medicine is different from any previous method. It absorbs the strengths of Chinese and Western medicine, elevates and develops them, while criticizing and eliminating their weaknesses. The comprehensive treatment method emphasizes the role of human factors, that is, the role of the patient, informing patients of relevant knowledge about the disease so that they can take control themselves. Its main features are: fully combining the subjective initiative of people with objective conditions; emphasizing that internal causes are primary and combining them with external causes, that is, the magnitude, quality, speed of the therapeutic effect depends on the patient's internal factors—thought, will, understanding, and the exertion of subjective initiative, etc.; combining local disease with overall treatment; starting from the organically interconnected whole of the functions of the human body's internal organs. In short, the comprehensive rapid treatment method combining Chinese and Western medicine is a revolutionary change in medical science, and also a revolutionary struggle. Based on such a medical method, I believe that tuberculosis can definitely be cured, and cured quickly. As for the magnitude, speed, and consolidation of the curative effect, these are closely related to the severity of the patient's condition, age, physical strength, and especially the quality of the execution of the treatment method. Different situations have different effects, and this is not because there is anything doubtful about the treatment method itself, but it depends most importantly on the patient themselves. Of course, this does not mean that the responsibility of medical personnel can be reduced; on the contrary, they should be more responsible and adopt a revolutionary spirit to "fight side by side" with patients.

Combine Revolutionary Feats
With Curing Disease

Use revolutionary spirit and revolutionary optimism to treat tuberculosis. This also applies to all diseases.

First, negate the old traditional ideas about tuberculosis, establish new understandings, break the desperate views of the past such as "ten consumptions, nine deaths," "tuberculosis cannot be cured," and do not fall into fatalism.

Why were there such pessimistic and desperate statements in the past? The old reactionary ruling class never cared about the suffering of the people, and in order to facilitate their rule over the people, in order to ignorant, suffocate the working people, let the people be slaves to disease, sit and wait for death, be content to be ruled by them, and not allow the people to explore the causes of the disease, to dig up the root of the disease—the root of exploitation and poverty, in order to achieve the goal of preventing the people from rising up to resist them. Now the people of our country have become masters of the country, control their own destiny, and of course must also control disease, be masters of disease, and control their own health and life; at the same time, the Party and the state are doing everything possible to serve the patients, and are carrying out movements to eliminate disease and benefit the people. In particular, they are enlightening patients' consciousness, letting patients master knowledge of the disease, and combining their own conscious initiative with medical methods to treat their own diseases. At the same time, they are raising hygiene, disease prevention, disease elimination, and the carrying out of sports activities to enhance the people's physique to the great feat of transforming the world. If we want to be masters of the country, and also masters of disease, then we must first remove the shadows and remnants cast by the old society from our thoughts. Therefore, we must break the old and establish the new, thoroughly criticize and negate the old and wrong views, timely grasp the new and correct medical theories and methods—treat disease, treat chronic diseases with a revolutionary spirit and revolutionary attitude; welcome new reforms in medicine, and actively promote the comprehensive treatment method combining Chinese and Western medicine. We must have determination in this regard, carry out revolutions in thought and action, and use advanced medical methods to cure our own diseases more quickly.

Second, we must have a spirit of revolutionary optimism. Worrying about getting sick is useless. The torment of disease is always painful. Impatience and worry do not help the disease, but rather add sorrow to sorrow and suffering to suffering, making the condition worse; self-indulgence is even more harmful. Therefore, we should adopt a positive attitude and overcome it with revolutionary optimism. Whenever I get sick, I never become negative or pessimistic, nor do I worry. I always muster up the energy to fight the disease, exercise tenacious willpower, and never relax until complete victory is achieved. I take overcoming disease as a test of myself, testing my revolutionary will and Party spirit. Naturally, after being sick for a long time, there will occasionally be slight fluctuations in mood, but I immediately raise my vigilance, criticize this kind of thought, and quickly overcome it. After each time I overcome disease, I not only gain physical health, but also make some progress in ideological and Party spirit aspects.

Third, fighting disease is a political task, and cannot be seen merely as a personal problem. A personalistic, liberal attitude towards one's own disease is not allowed. Because in a socialist country, the individual is a member of the collective, and we jointly bear the great task of building socialism. If a person gets sick, a minor illness will weaken their health and affect short-term work and study; if the illness lasts a long time, they will lose their health and lose their ability to work, which makes it difficult to participate in work and study, which is detrimental to production. At the same time, if you get sick, get seriously ill, or get sick for a long time, and let the disease develop and spread, this will increase the burden on the country and increase the burden on the organization, which is unfavorable to yourself and the collective. Therefore, anyone who is ill, especially chronic diseases, must face up to it, seriously treat the disease and fight it seriously, and strive for minor illnesses and small illnesses to get better quickly, and for serious illnesses and major illnesses to be alleviated, shorten the treatment time, and achieve recovery. We must further improve our understanding. Our revolution has two tasks: one is class struggle, and the other is natural struggle. We must regard the struggle against disease as a task of struggling against nature. We must combine the great feat of revolution with our own treatment of disease, integrate the individual into the whole, integrate into the revolutionary cause, so that we can improve our ideological awareness, promote revolutionary optimism, increase courage and perseverance, and regard ourselves as fearless warriors who will surely win victory.

Fully Mobilize Subjective Initiative and
Combine it with Treatment Measures

Fully mobilizing subjective initiative is the most basic and important condition for achieving victory in the fight against disease. That is to say, it is necessary to give play to the patient's conscious initiative, just as Comrade Mao Zedong instructed: "Conscious initiative" is "the characteristic that distinguishes man from things." Therefore, it is entirely possible and necessary for patients to fully mobilize their subjective initiative. Because the characteristic that distinguishes man from things lies in this. If we don't give play to our subjective initiative, then isn't the difference between man and things gone? The question is whether we understand and are willing to do so. We must understand and dare to do so. This requires us to first have a revolution in our thoughts, and at the same time take revolutionary actions. We must strive to be masters of disease, control our own destiny, not be prisoners of disease, and not be manipulated by disease. Overcome negative and pessimistic thoughts about disease with revolutionary optimism. At the same time, we must fully mobilize our subjective initiative, and be good at combining it with the objective environment and treatment measures. Because the changes in all things are determined by their internal factors, not by external causes. If our thoughts and views are correct and we exert our subjective initiative, even if the environmental conditions are poor and the medical conditions are sometimes not perfect, we can still overcome the disease. I will give one or two examples from my own experience for your reference. I have fought tuberculosis and won victory. Twenty-six years ago, when the Chinese Workers' and Peasants' Red Army held the 25,000-li Long March, I was just after a severe hemorrhage and high fever, and my physical strength was extremely weak, but under the care and arrangement of the Party, I was still carried on a stretcher and set off with the team. During the march, there was no such thing as recuperation, no hospitals and quiet environments, and no places to practice qigong or tai chi; under the enemy's encirclement, we marched very nervously every day, without a stable life. But I gave play to my subjective initiative. I am a Communist Party member, can I not overcome disease? I thought, the soldiers are marching with guns and equipment, and they have to constantly fight the enemy, so can I not overcome the enemy of tuberculosis while being carried? So I focused my energy on fighting tuberculosis. I paid attention to everything I should pay attention to, strictly adhered to the medical methods that could be followed, did not increase the condition, and cooperated closely with the medical staff. At the same time, I also tried my best to use the unique superior conditions of nature at that time—from morning to night, I lived in the beautiful nature of the motherland—breathing fresh air and absorbing nutrition. I followed the army across snow-capped mountains and grasslands, and when I walked across the snow-capped mountains, I could see the wonders of the changes of spring, summer, autumn and winter. This superior condition is not available to many patients. In particular, I firmly believed that the Communist Party and the Red Army are invincible, that the revolution will surely be victorious; I also firmly believed that I could overcome the disease and must overcome the disease, and prepare to do more work for the Party and the people. This belief gave me unlimited strength to overcome the disease. Therefore, I was optimistic and happy, and I regarded all difficulties as commonplace, so the condition did not develop, but instead improved. In 1937, the Party Central Committee asked me to go to Beiping for an examination to clarify my illness. An X-ray was taken at Lu Yongchun Hospital. The doctor was surprised to find that there were as many as seven calcified scars of tuberculosis in my lungs. He asked me: "How did you cure it?" At that time, I couldn't tell him the actual situation, but I said: I rely on two magic weapons: one is optimism, and the other is outdoor living.

The fact that I cured tuberculosis proves the importance of fully mobilizing subjective initiative. I took the internal cause as the main factor, that is, healthy thinking as the main factor, used the favorable part of the external cause, and eliminated the unfavorable part of the external cause. I won the victory, and my tuberculosis has not recurred for more than 20 years.

I also overcame another disease. In 1953, I got diabetes. The test results showed that urine sugar was four "tens" and blood sugar was more than 200 mg, and the condition was indeed not mild. The general treatment method is to control diet, prohibit eating sugar, and drug treatment. But this can only control the development of the disease and cannot cure it. Although I strictly controlled my diet and ate sugar, the disease did not get better, so I tracked down and studied the method of cure. I found the cause and treatment method in a paper by an expert on diabetes. It pointed out that 80% to 90% of diabetics are caused by obesity. My weight at the time was my highest weight in ten years—the root came from here, so I treated it from here. He especially proposed a method: that is, physical exercise, walking 1,000 steps before each meal, walking 200 steps after meals, and eating eight or nine points full for each meal. From then on, I became my own doctor and did not use drug treatment at all. In addition to controlling my diet and strictly prohibiting eating sugar, I insisted on walking as prescribed before and after meals without interruption, and continued for six months, and my weight decreased significantly, and my diabetes was finally completely eliminated. In recent years, my blood sugar has gradually returned to normal, and I have achieved complete victory.

My cure of diabetes more clearly illustrates the importance of internal causes and the mobilization of subjective initiative.

My examples of curing diseases and the examples of many people curing diseases all show that as long as we fully mobilize our subjective initiative, we can overcome diseases. On the contrary, although objective conditions are very good and medical measures are advanced, if the patient is completely in a passive state, relies solely on medicine and doctors, and often throws tantrums, does not look for the cause of the disease and strictly implements the current comprehensive medical methods, in this way, not only will the disease not be cured quickly, but also twists and turns, side issues, and even complications will occur, making minor illnesses turn into serious illnesses, and serious illnesses prolonged and difficult to cure. Fully mobilizing subjective initiative plays an important role in medical treatment; it is also a basic and necessary condition for the comprehensive rapid treatment method combining Chinese and Western medicine. Therefore, patients and medical workers must attach importance to this, cooperate with each other, and actively master and give play to it.

Win Health
For the Cause of Communism

After the disease is cured, it is necessary to continuously consolidate the curative effect, expand the results, enhance physical fitness, and ensure continuous learning and work. To achieve this, we must first establish firm confidence, exercise tenacious willpower, and insist on continuously mobilizing subjective initiative. From the positive aspect, we must adhere to physical exercise, especially those now advocated such as qigong and tai chi, and we must persevere. Because exercise can enhance physical fitness, enhance resistance, and enhance the role of internal causes. We must develop the habit of exercising, but developing a habit also requires continuous self-struggle. Chairman Mao called on the people of the whole country to develop sports activities, exercise, and enhance physical fitness. Our Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao instructed that both men and women, young and old, should engage in a sports activity. In order to better and continuously leap forward, we should all enthusiastically respond to the call of the Party and Chairman Mao and resolutely implement it. After each time I get sick, as long as I can move, I insist on physical exercise. In addition to regular walks, I also do fitness exercises, tai chi, and sword dancing, gradually increasing from ten minutes or ten minutes every morning to more than forty minutes. Due to continuous exercise, my physical strength has been enhanced, my mental strength has also been restored, and my workload has gradually been restored.

In addition, after the patient is cured, they should gradually increase the time for labor, study and work. However, in the early stage of recovery, it is not advisable to participate in various activities too early, too vigorously, or too much. In terms of keeping warm and health care, pay attention to adapting to climate changes. From the prevention aspect, we must also pay attention to the infection of various infectious diseases, especially diseases that directly affect lung diseases such as colds and upper respiratory tract infections, to avoid recurrence of old diseases.

If we do not strictly and conscientiously pay attention to and abide by the above issues, it may cause fluctuations in the disease, reduce the achievements that have been made, prolong the treatment time, and even fail to consolidate the achievements that have been made, which will affect learning and work. Therefore, all those who have been cured and those who are being treated and have made achievements must not be complacent, negligent, or careless; we must ensure the curative effect, consolidate the achievements, so as to restore health as soon as possible.

In short, we must use the spirit of continuous revolution and revolutionary optimism to overcome tuberculosis, overcome all diseases, win health, and strive to make more and better contributions to the great cause of socialism and communism.

### 用革命的精神战胜疾病

专栏：

    用革命的精神战胜疾病	邓颖超
    《用革命的精神战胜疾病》一文，是根据邓颖超同志1960年8月20日在北京市结核病防治所主办的报告会上，对正在采用中西医结合综合快速疗法的肺结核病人的讲话整理而成的。最近《健康报》和《中国妇女》杂志曾先后发表了这篇讲话。我们认为这篇讲话不仅对肺结核病人和患其他疾病的人有帮助，而且对一般读者如何用革命精神战胜困难也是有教育意义的，因此转载于此。文内的小标题为编者所加。　　　　　　　　　　　——编　者
    现在，我想和大家谈谈我对疾病包括肺结核病作斗争的体会和我怎样用革命的精神战胜疾病的。在《群众防痨》和《中国青年》杂志上，已先后发表过我在这方面的一些情况，在这里我就不重复。我着重讲四个主要的问题，供大家参考。
    肺结核一定治得好
    肺结核病能够治好，也一定能治得好。为什么？因为有许多肺结核病人都治好了，我的肺结核也治好了，就可以证明。而且过去环境条件都远不能和现在相比。有了现在这样好的条件，只要病人发挥了主观能动性和革命的乐观主义，掌握了得病的原因、性质、规律，再配合一些必要的治疗条件，如药物医疗、体育锻炼和适当的劳动、文娱活动等，就能好起来。何况现在我国有了社会主义制度的优越性，从而带来了对疾病治疗的优越条件；医学科学的进步，医药疗养条件的改进，特别是最近推行的中西医结合综合快速疗法，不但能治好结核病，而且能够很快地在短期内治疗好。
    中西医结合综合疗法和过去任何一种疗法都不同。它吸取了中西医的长处，把它提高发展了，同时批判和排除了中西医的短处。综合疗法强调人的因素作用，也就是病人的作用，告诉病人疾病有关的知识，由他们自己来掌握。它的特点主要是：充分地发挥人的主观能动性和客观条件相结合；强调内因为主和外因相结合，就是说，医疗效果的大小、好坏、快慢，决定于病人的内在因素——思想、意志、认识和发挥主观能动性等等；根据局部病患和整体治疗相结合；从人体内部器官功能相互的有机联系的整体出发。总之，中西医结合综合快速疗法，是医疗学上的革命性的变化，也是一场革命斗争。根据这样一个医疗方法，我相信肺结核一定能治好，而且好得快。至于疗效的大小、快慢、巩固与否，这和病人的病情轻重，年龄大小，体质强弱，特别是和执行疗法的好坏有密切关系。情况不同，效果也不同，这不是疗法本身有什么可以怀疑之处，最重要是取决于病人自己。当然这不是说医务人员的责任可以减轻，相反地，应该更加负责，采取革命的精神与病人一起“并肩作战”。
    把革命的壮举
    和治病结合起来
    用革命的精神和革命的乐观主义对待肺结核病。这一点，也适用于一切疾病。
    第一，要否定对肺结核病的旧的传统思想，树立新的认识，打破过去所谓的“十痨九死”，“结核病无法治好”的绝望观点，不要陷入宿命论。
    为什么过去会有这些悲观绝望的说法呢？旧的反动统治阶级从不关心人民痛苦，并且为了便于他们统治人民，为了愚昧、窒息劳动人民，让人民作疾病的奴隶，坐以待毙，安于被他们统治，不让人民去探索病因，挖掘得病的穷根——被剥削的穷苦的根源，以便达到阻止人民起来反抗他们的目的。现在我国人民作了国家的主人，掌握了自己的命运，当然也要掌握疾病，作疾病的主人，掌握自己的健康和生命；同时党和国家千方百计地为病人服务，并且开展消灭疾病的运动，造福人民。特别是启发病人的觉悟，让病人掌握疾病的知识，把自己的自觉能动性和医疗方法结合起来治疗自己的病。同时把讲卫生、预防疾病，消灭疾病，开展体育活动，增强人民体质，提高到改造世界的伟大壮举。如果我们要作国家的主人，也要作疾病的主人的话，那就首先要从我们思想里把旧社会所投下的暗影和残余去掉。因此，我们必须破旧立新，彻底批判和否定旧的错误观点，及时掌握新的正确的医疗理论和方法——用革命的精神和革命态度对待疾病，对待慢性病；欢迎医学方面新的改革，积极推行中西医结合的综合疗法。我们在这方面要有决心，要进行思想和行动上的革命，用先进的医疗方法，就能把自己的病较快地治好。
    第二，要有革命的乐观主义精神，害了病着急是无用的。疾病的折磨总是痛苦的，急躁忧愁，无助于疾病，反而是愁上加愁，苦上加苦，使病情加重；放任自毁，更加有害。所以应当采取积极的态度，用革命的乐观主义战胜它。我每次生病的时候，从不消极悲观，也不着急。我总是鼓起劲同疾病作斗争，锻炼顽强的毅力，不达全胜，绝不松懈。我把战胜疾病，作为对自己的一种考验，考验我的革命意志和党性。自然，病久了，在情绪上也会偶然有微小的波动，但我即刻引起警惕，对这种思想进行批判，很快地把它克服了。在我每次战胜疾病以后，不仅得到身体上的健康，而且在思想方面、党性方面都要取得一些锻炼和进步。
    第三，对疾病作斗争是一项政治任务，不能仅仅看成是个人的问题，不允许对自己的疾病采取个人主义、自由主义的态度。因为在社会主义国家里，个人是属于集体的成员之一，我们共同担负着建设社会主义的伟大任务。一个人生了病，轻的会削弱健康，影响短期的工作和学习；如果病久了，就会失去健康，失去劳动能力，也就难于参加工作和学习，这样对生产是不利的。同时如果得了病，病得重，病得久，听任疾病的发展和蔓延，这就增加国家的负担，增加组织上的负担，对自己对集体也都是不利的。因此，凡是害了病的人，特别是慢性疾病，必须正视，对疾病进行认真的治疗和严肃的斗争，努力争取轻病、小病快好，重病、大病减轻，缩短治疗时间，达到痊愈。我们还要进一步提高认识，我们的革命有两重任务，一个是阶级斗争，一个是自然斗争。我们要把向疾病作斗争，看成是向自然作斗争的一项任务。我们要把革命的伟大壮举和自己治病结合起来，把个人融汇到整体中，融汇到革命事业中，这样就能提高自己的思想觉悟，发扬革命的乐观主义，增加勇气和毅力，把自己作为一个无畏的、一定能取得胜利的战士。充分发挥主观能动性和
    治疗措施相结合
    充分发挥主观能动性，是和疾病作斗争取得胜利的最基本的重要条件。这就是说，要发挥病人的自觉能动性，也正如毛泽东同志指示的：“自觉的能动性”，“是人之所以区别于物的特点”。因此，病人充分地发挥主观能动性，是完全可能和必要的。因为人区别于物的特点，就在此。如果不发挥主观能动性，那么人和物的区别不是就没有了吗？问题在于我们懂不懂和肯不肯这样去做。我们必须要懂得和勇于这样去做。这就首先要我们在思想上革命，同时要采取革命的行动。要争取做疾病的主人，掌握自己的命运，不做疾病的俘虏，不受疾病的摆布。用革命的乐观主义，克服对疾病的消极悲观思想。同时要充分发挥主观能动性，并要善于跟客观环境和治疗措施相结合。因为一切事物的变化，都是决定于它内在的因素，而不是决定于外因的。如果我们的思想、观点正确，发挥主观能动性，即使所处的环境条件差一些，医疗条件有时还不够完备，我们还是可以战胜疾病的。我把自己的经历举一两个例子供给大家参考。我曾和肺结核作过斗争，取得了胜利。在二十六年前，中国工农红军举行两万五千里长征时，我正是在大吐血和高烧刚过以后，体力衰弱已极，但我仍在党的关怀和安排下，被担架抬着随队伍出发了。在行军中说不上什么疗养，没有什么医院和安静的环境，更没有什么练气功呀，打太极拳的场地；在敌人的包围下，每日很紧张地行军，没有安定的生活。但我发挥了主观能动性。我是一个共产党员，不能战胜疾病还行吗？我想战士们背着枪炮和装备行军，还要和敌人不断地作战，我被人抬着，还不能战胜肺病这个敌人吗？所以我集中精力和结核病斗争。我注意我应注意的一切，严格遵守可能遵守的医疗办法，不使病情增加，并和医务人员密切合作。同时，我还尽量利用了当时独特的大自然的优越条件——从早上到深夜，我都在祖国的江山如此多娇的大自然中生活——呼吸新鲜空气，吸收营养。我随军走过雪山草地，当走过雪山的时候能看到春夏秋冬变化的奇景。这个优越条件是很多病人没有的。特别是我坚决相信：共产党、红军是无坚不摧的，革命一定能够胜利；我也深信我能战胜疾病而且必须战胜疾病，准备为党为人民做更多的工作。这种信念给了我战胜疾病的无限力量。因此，我是乐观的、愉快的，一切困难都等闲视之，所以病情没有发展，相反地好起来了。1937年党中央为了让我把病查清楚，叫我到北平检查。在卢永春医院照了X光片子。医生惊讶地发现：我的两肺竟有七处结核钙化的疤痕。他问我：“你是怎样治好的？”当时我不能把实际情况告诉他，只说：我靠两个法宝：一个是乐观主义，一个是户外生活多。
    我治好肺病的事实，证明了充分发挥主观能动性的重要性。我以内因为主，即以健康的思想为主，运用了外因的有利部分，排除了外因的不利部分。我得到了胜利，二十多年来我的肺病没有复发过。
    我还战胜了另一种疾病。1953年我得了糖尿病，检查的结果，尿糖是四个“十”字，血糖二百多毫克，病情的确不轻。一般的治疗方法，就是：控制饮食，禁止吃糖和药物治疗。但这只能控制病的发展，不能根治。我虽严格控制饮食和吃糖，但病并没有好，我就追踪研究根治的方法。我在一位专家论糖尿病的论文中，找到了病因和治疗的办法。它指出糖尿病人80％到90％都是由肥胖所引起。我当时的体重是我十年来最高的体重——根源从这里来，我就从这里治疗。他特别提出一个方法：就是体育锻炼，在每顿饭前走一千步，饭后走二百步，每餐吃八九分饱。从此，我就做自己的医生，根本没有用药物治疗。我除控制饮食，严禁吃糖外，饭前饭后坚持按规定步行，没有一次间断，连续做了六个月，体重显著减轻，我的糖尿病终于完全消灭了。近几年来我的血糖逐步恢复正常，我获得了全胜。
    我治好糖尿病更清楚地说明内因为主和发挥主观能动性的重要了。
    我治好疾病的事例和许多人治好病的事例都说明：只要我们充分发挥了主观能动性，就可以战胜疾病。相反的，客观条件虽然很好，医疗措施虽然先进，但是如果病人完全陷于被动状态，只靠医药、医生，又时常闹情绪，不去找病因和严格执行现在的综合医疗方法，这样，不但病不能很快治好，而且会发生波折、枝节，甚至复杂化，使轻病转重，重病拖久难治好。充分发挥主观能动性，在医疗上是起重要作用的；也是中西医结合综合快速疗法的基本必要条件。所以病人和医务工作者要重视这点，相互合作，积极地掌握它，发挥它。
    为共产主义事业
      赢得健康
    病治好了以后，就要不断地巩固疗效，扩大成绩，增强体质，保证持续学习和工作。我们要作到这一点，首先要树立坚定的信心，锻炼顽强的毅力，坚持不断地发挥主观能动性，从积极方面，坚持体育锻炼，特别是现在提倡的如气功、太极拳等，要坚持下去。因为锻炼能增强体质，增强抵抗力，增强内因的作用。我们要养成锻炼的习惯，但养成习惯也要经过不断地自我斗争。毛主席号召全国人民发展体育活动，锻炼身体，增强体质，我们党中央和毛主席指示无论男女老幼都要搞一项体育活动。我们为了能更好地持续跃进，都应该热烈响应党和毛主席的号召，并坚决执行。我每次患病后，只要能活动，就坚持体育锻炼，除了经常散步外还做健身操，打太极拳，舞剑，每天早晨从十分钟、十几分钟，逐步增加到四十多分钟。由于坚持锻炼，我的体力增强了，脑力也有了恢复，我的工作量也逐步在恢复。
    此外，病人在病好后，还要逐步地增加劳动、学习和工作的时间。但在病初愈的时期，不宜过早，过猛，过多地参加各项活动。在保暖保健方面，要注意适应气候的变化。从预防方面，还要注意各种传染疾病的感染，特别是直接影响肺病的病患如感冒、上呼吸道感染等，以避免引起旧病的复发。
    对于以上这些问题，如果我们不严格认真地注意遵守，就可能引起疾病的波动，减退已得的成绩，延长治疗时间，以至不能巩固已得疗效，又会影响到学习和工作。所以，凡是病已经好了的人和正在治疗取得成绩的人，都不能自满疏忽、麻痹大意；要保证疗效，巩固成绩，以便早日恢复健康。
    总之，我们一定要用不断革命的精神和革命的乐观主义战胜肺结核病，战胜一切疾病，赢得健康，争取为社会主义和共产主义的伟大事业，作出更多更好的贡献。
