    Premier Zhou Hosts Grand Banquet to Welcome Distinguished Burmese Guests
    Premier Zhou says that the solution of the Sino-Burmese border issue sets a successful example for resolving border issues and other international pending cases.
    Premier U Nu says that the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence have provided a new, better and more solid foundation for the development of friendship between the two countries.
Xinhua News Agency, September 28th: Premier Zhou Enlai held a grand banquet at the Great Hall of the People tonight to warmly welcome Burmese Prime Minister U Nu and his wife, Burmese Chief of Staff General Ne Win and his wife, and all distinguished guests of the Burmese Federal Government Delegation.
    Tonight, the magnificent banquet hall of the Great Hall of the People was filled with kinship-like friendship. Premier Zhou Enlai and other Chinese state leaders, along with people from all ethnic groups and walks of life in the capital, gathered with Prime Minister U Nu, General Ne Win, and more than 300 distinguished Burmese guests. Everyone toasted each other with boundless joy, warmly celebrating that the "Paukphaw" relationship, formed over thousands of years between the Chinese and Burmese people, had reached a new stage due to the comprehensive resolution of the Sino-Burmese border issue.
    Premier Zhou Enlai spoke at the banquet, extending the most sincere and warmest welcome on behalf of the Chinese government, the Chinese people, and in his own name, to His Excellency Prime Minister U Nu, His Excellency General Ne Win, and the more than 300 distinguished guests.
    Premier Zhou said: This year, the friendly relations between China and Burma have developed to a new stage. Our two countries have not only signed the Sino-Burmese Treaty of Friendship and Mutual Non-Aggression and the Sino-Burmese Agreement on Border Issues, but will also sign the Sino-Burmese Border Treaty, thereby comprehensively and finally resolving the border issue left over from history between our two countries. Premier Zhou said that thanks to the efforts of the Chinese government and successive Burmese governments, especially His Excellency Prime Minister U Nu and His Excellency General Ne Win, with the signing of the Sino-Burmese Treaty of Friendship and Mutual Non-Aggression and the Sino-Burmese Border Treaty, the edifice of Sino-Burmese peace and friendship will finally be completed. We are extremely pleased to be able to celebrate the completion of this edifice with His Excellency Prime Minister U Nu, His Excellency General Ne Win, and other distinguished Burmese guests who have made positive contributions to the construction of this edifice.
    Premier Zhou said that the encouraging development of Sino-Burmese friendly relations is by no means accidental. This is because our two countries have always held an unwavering belief in the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, which we jointly initiated, and have made sincere and unremitting efforts to realize these principles. This is due to the political foresight of the national leaders of our two countries, and because we place the fundamental interests of safeguarding the national independence, people's friendship, and Asian peace of our two countries first. It should be particularly pointed out that when dealing with issues directly involving the common interests of the two countries, China and Burma have adopted an attitude of mutual understanding and accommodation, friendly consultation, and joint efforts to seek reasonable solutions in accordance with the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. This has enabled China and Burma to achieve a smooth and satisfactory solution to such a complex issue as the Sino-Burmese border. This is a victory of Sino-Burmese friendly cooperation and a victory of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. The solution of the border issue between our two countries has set a successful example for resolving border issues and other international pending cases, and also set an example for peaceful coexistence between countries with different social systems. Premier Zhou pointed out: The consolidation and development of our two countries' friendly and cooperative relations not only conforms to the vital interests of the two peoples, but is also conducive to maintaining peace in Asia and the world.
    Prime Minister U Nu spoke at the banquet. He said: In the depths of our hearts, there is a feeling of kinship, which can be expressed by the two words "Paukphaw." Whenever we come to China, it feels like we are back home. The traditional hospitality of the Chinese people truly makes people feel unconstrained.
    Prime Minister U Nu said: Our two countries have maintained pleasant and sincere relations throughout history. Since independence, our two countries have sincerely and unswervingly strived to further promote and consolidate this relationship. The Bandung Spirit and the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, which we two are honored to have jointly initiated, have undoubtedly provided a new, better, and more solid foundation for strengthening and developing this brotherly friendship. He said: One of the most positive and satisfying results of adhering to and faithfully applying these principles is the elimination of bad things like doubts, suspicions, and mistrust, and their replacement with the development of a spirit of cooperation between the two countries.
    Prime Minister U Nu said: My dear and distinguished friend General Ne Win, during his tenure as Prime Minister of the Union of Burma, not only signed the Treaty of Friendship and Mutual Non-Aggression, but also the Agreement on the Sino-Burmese Border Issue, which greatly contributed to the final settlement of this problem that had not been resolved for nearly a century. By completing the above, he has laid a good and solid foundation for the "edifice of friendship" aptly mentioned by Your Excellency. With the signing of the Sino-Burmese Border Treaty, I will now be happy and honored to cut the ribbon for the opening ceremony of this edifice. Prime Minister U Nu expressed his highest respect to all members of the Joint Boundary Committee responsible for drafting the Burmese-Chinese Border Treaty. He said: They conducted friendly negotiations in a spirit of mutual understanding and accommodation, and, in particular, maintained and developed the desire of the two governments to conduct sincere cooperation in accordance with the Five Principles. Prime Minister U Nu spoke of the generosity and vision of Premier Zhou Enlai and other Chinese leaders, who attached great importance to ensuring, maintaining, and developing the friendship between the two peoples and the national interests. He hopes that the spirit of mutual concession and friendly cooperation between the two countries based on the Five Principles will be applied on a larger scale, thereby promoting friendship between countries and world peace.
    After Premier Zhou Enlai and Prime Minister U Nu spoke, the band played the national anthems of China and Burma respectively. Their speeches were warmly welcomed.
    The entire Burmese guests, including the Burmese delegation of the Sino-Burmese Joint Boundary Committee headed by Brigadier General Aung Gyi, the military delegation headed by Brigadier General Maung Maung, the cultural delegation headed by Colonel So Min, the sports delegation headed by Lieutenant Colonel Maung Win, the news delegation headed by U Khin, and the trade delegation headed by U Myo, were invited to attend the banquet tonight.
    Accompanying the banquet were Vice Premiers of the State Council He Long, Chen Yi, Li Xiannian, Nie Rongzhen, Luo Ruiqing, Xi Zhongxun, Vice Chairmen of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress Shen Junru, Guo Moruo, Huang Yanpei, Chen Shutong, Saifudin, Cheng Qian, Panchen Erdeni Qoigyijabu, Lin Feng, Vice Chairmen of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference Li Siguang, Bao Erhan, Vice Chairmen of the National Defense Council Zhang Zhizhong, Fu Zuoyi, President of the Supreme People's Court Xie Juezai, Procurator-General of the Supreme People's Procuratorate Zhang Dingcheng, and others.
    Vice Foreign Ministers Zhang Hanfu, Geng Biao, Chinese Ambassador to Burma Li Yimang, heads of various departments of our national organs, democratic parties, people's organizations, and Beijing Municipality, generals of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, and well-known figures from all ethnic groups and walks of life also attended the banquet.
    Burmese Ambassador to China Kyaw Winn and diplomatic officials of the embassy, as well as envoys from various countries stationed in China, were invited to attend the banquet.
    During the banquet, cultural workers from the capital performed many wonderful Chinese and Burmese songs and dances to add to the festivities.
    A reception was held before the banquet began. At the reception, Prime Minister U Nu, General Ne Win, and all the distinguished Burmese guests met and talked with people from all walks of life in China. (Attached pictures)

　　周总理盛宴欢迎缅甸贵宾
　　周总理说，中缅边界问题的解决为解决边界问题和国际间其他悬案树立成功榜样
　　吴努总理说，和平共处五项原则已为发展两国友谊提供新的更好的更稳固的基础
    新华社28日讯　周恩来总理今晚在人民大会堂举行盛大宴会，热烈欢迎缅甸联邦总理吴努和夫人、缅甸国防军总参谋长奈温将军和夫人以及缅甸联邦政府代表团的全体贵宾。
    今晚，瑰丽的人民大会堂宴会厅充满了亲戚般的友谊。周恩来总理等我国国家领导人和首都各族各界人士，同吴努总理、奈温将军和三百多位缅甸贵宾，欢聚一堂，大家怀着无限欢欣的情意，互相敬酒，热烈祝贺中缅两国人民千百年形成的胞波关系由于中缅边界问题的全面解决达到了一个新的阶段。
    周恩来总理在宴会上讲话，代表中国政府，中国人民并且以他个人的名义，对吴努总理阁下，奈温将军阁下和三百多位贵宾们的光临，表示最诚挚、最热烈的欢迎。
    周总理说：今年，中缅两国的友好关系发展到了一个新的阶段。我们两国不但签订了中缅友好和互不侵犯条约和中缅两国关于边界问题的协定，而且将要签订中缅边界条约，从而使我们两国间历史上遗留下来的边界问题获得全面的最后的解决。周总理说，由于中国政府和缅甸历届政府特别是吴努总理阁下和奈温将军阁下的努力，随着中缅友好和互不侵犯条约和中缅边界条约的签订，中缅和平友好大厦终将建成。我们万分高兴，能够同曾经为这个大厦的建设作出过积极贡献的吴努总理阁下、奈温将军阁下和其他缅甸贵宾们一起来庆贺这座大厦的落成。
    周总理说，中缅友好关系所以能够获得这样令人鼓舞的发展，绝不是偶然的。这是由于我们两国对自己所共同倡导的和平共处五项原则始终怀有坚定不移的信念，并且一直为实现这些原则，作了真诚不懈的努力。这是由于我们两国的国家领导人的政治远见，由于我们把维护两国民族独立、人民友谊和亚洲和平的根本利益放在第一位。特别应当指出的是，中缅双方在处理直接涉及两国共同利益问题的时候，是根据和平共处五项原则，采取互谅互让、友好协商的态度，共同努力谋求合理解决的。这就使中缅两国能够对中缅边界这样复杂的问题获得了顺利和圆满的解决。这是中缅两国友好合作的胜利，是和平共处五项原则的胜利。我们两国边界问题的解决，为解决边界问题和国际间其他悬案树立了成功的榜样，也为不同社会制度国家的和平共处树立了榜样。周总理指出：我们两国友好合作关系的巩固和发展，不但符合两国人民的切身利益，而且也有利于维护亚洲和世界的和平。
  吴努总理在宴会上讲话。他说：在我们的心坎深处有着谊同亲戚的感情，这种感情可以用“胞波”两字来表达。我们不论什么时候到中国来都好像是回到了家里一样。中国人民传统的殷勤好客也确使人感到心中毫无拘束。
    吴努总理说：我们两国在整个历史中一直保持着愉快和真诚的关系。自从独立以来，我们两国真诚地始终不渝地为进一步促进和巩固这种关系而努力。我们两人很荣幸地共同创导的万隆精神和和平共处五项原则，无疑地已经为加强和发展这种兄弟般的友谊提供了新的、更好的、更稳固的基础。他说：信守和忠实运用这些原则的最积极、最令人满意的结果之一是消除了疑虑、怀疑和猜疑之类的坏事而代之以两国之间合作精神的发展。
    吴努总理说：我的亲爱的和杰出的朋友奈温将军在他担任缅甸联邦总理的职务期间不仅签订了友好互不侵犯条约，而且还签订了中缅边界问题的协定，这个协定大大有助于这个将近一个世纪以来所未能解决的问题的最后解决。由于完成了以上这些，他为阁下所恰当地提到的“友好大厦”很好地和真正地打下了基础。随着中缅边界条约的签订，现在我将很愉快地和荣幸地为这座大厦的开幕仪式剪彩。吴努总理向负有起草缅中边界条约的责任的联合边界委员会的全体成员表示崇高的敬意。他说：他们以互谅互让的精神进行了友好谈判，并且特别是根据五项原则，维护和发展了两国政府进行真诚合作的愿望。吴努总理谈到了周恩来总理以及其他中国领导人的慷慨和远见，对于保障、维护和发展两国人民的友谊和国家利益都给予极大的重视。他希望两国基于五项原则的互让精神和友好合作将在更大的范围内得到运用，从而促进各国之间的友谊和世界和平。
    在周恩来总理和吴努总理讲话以后，乐队分别奏中缅两国的国歌。他们的讲话都受到了极其热烈的欢迎。
    以昂季准将为首的中缅边界联合委员会缅方代表团，以貌貌准将为首的军事代表团，以苏敏上校为首的文化代表团，以貌温中校为首的体育代表团，以吴钦为首的新闻代表团，以吴妙为首的贸易代表团的全体缅甸贵宾，都应邀出席了今晚的宴会。
    出席宴会作陪的有：国务院副总理贺龙、陈毅、李先念、聂荣臻、罗瑞卿、习仲勋，全国人民代表大会常务委员会副委员长沈钧儒、郭沫若、黄炎培、陈叔通、赛福鼎、程潜、班禅额尔德尼·却吉坚赞、林枫，政协全国委员会副主席李四光、包尔汉，国防委员会副主席张治中、傅作义，最高人民法院院长谢觉哉，最高人民检察院检察长张鼎丞等。
    陈毅副总理在祝酒时说，今年春节，奈温将军率领缅甸政府代表团到中国进行访问，和我们签订了中缅友好和互不侵犯条约。随后，中国同尼泊尔、阿富汗、几内亚先后分别缔结了和平友好条约或友好互不侵犯条约。这次吴努总理又光临北京，并且将同我们签订中缅边界条约。这说明中国和这些国家都是爱好和平的。这对西方国家诬蔑中国好战是一个有力的回击。只要我们致力于和平事业，世界和平就一定能够维护，和平力量一定可以战胜战争势力。陈毅副总理说，今年是中缅友好年，他提议为中缅边界条约即将签订，为中缅两国人民的友谊万古常青，干杯。
    出席宴会的，还有外交部副部长章汉夫、耿飚，中国驻缅甸大使李一氓，我国国家机关各部门、各民主党派、各人民团体和北京市的负责人，中国人民解放军的将军们，以及各族各界著名人士。
    缅甸驻中国大使叫温和大使馆外交官员以及各国驻中国的使节，应邀出席了宴会。
    在宴会进行过程中，首都的文艺工作者表演了许多精采的中缅两国的歌舞节目助兴。
    宴会开始以前举行了酒会。在酒会上，吴努总理、奈温将军和缅甸的全体贵宾们，同中国各方面人士会面交谈。（附图片）
