　　Labor Psychology Problems in the Technological Revolution
　　Fang Yunqiu
    The technological innovation and technological revolution movement has raised many new questions for labor psychology. Therefore, labor psychology workers should consider how to solve these practical problems, so that labor psychology can better serve the technological innovation and technological revolution movement, and labor psychology itself can be further developed.
              Preliminary Research on Creative Thinking
    In the technological innovation and technological revolution movement, labor psychology workers should first summarize and study the laws of people's creative activities, that is: what objective conditions can most favorably promote subjective initiative – the full play of active creative thinking? How can the creative process be shortened to the greatest extent? How can the slogan of continuous revolution most effectively become the practical action of the working masses? And so on.
    Regarding creative thinking activities in the technological innovation and technological revolution movement, the Labor Psychology Group of the Institute of Psychology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences has conducted some research at the Shanghai Huatong Switch Factory, the Beijing Switch Factory, and the Changxindian Locomotive Factory. For example, at the Beijing Switch Factory and the Changxindian Locomotive Factory, researchers worked with the workers, meticulously recording the circumstances and laws of thinking activities in the creative process, producing multiple sets of automatic stamping dies, and solving the long-unresolved problem of mechanized spring hanger processing at the locomotive factory. The stamping work in both switch factories could not keep up due to the surge in production, and became a backward link in the entire factory's production. Researchers assisted the factory in adopting the following measures to promote inventions and creations.
    First, analyze contradictions and determine topics. We jointly studied with workshop leaders, technicians, and workers, clarified that the main contradiction in production was the automation of loading and unloading of stamped parts, and determined the innovation topic. Second, use "prototypes" to inspire thinking (any creative invention must go through certain inspiration, and things that have an inspirational effect are called "prototypes"). We used schematic diagrams and simplified models of automated machine parts as prototypes to inspire workers' thinking and design, and continuously provided verbal inspiration during the work process to guide the creators' ideas. Third, think and do simultaneously, and gradually improve. People's understanding is gradually improved. Therefore, at the Huatong factory, we used the development law of people's thinking activities and first proposed relatively simple topics to the workers. The prototype was just a schematic diagram of a semi-automated simple stamping die automatic mechanism. On this basis, the workers created a more advanced fully automated stamping die. Finally, we held an exhibition of more than one hundred automatic stamping dies that were created. Some workers used the automatic stamping die as a prototype to create a conductive slice counting device, eliminating manual operation and increasing efficiency by two times.
    Through the above work, we have preliminarily summarized some laws of the development of creative thinking activities.
    First, "prototypes" have a great positive effect on inspiring creative thinking, but they need to be selected appropriately, otherwise they may have a restrictive effect. Generally speaking, the closer the prototype is to the machine part to be created, the greater the inspirational effect. However, we also observed that some prototypes were too specific, causing the design to be close to imitation and weakening creativity. For example, when we gave the photos of the automatic stamping die first made by the workers of Huatong Factory to the workers of Beijing Switch Factory as part of the prototype, they were restricted more in the design.
    Second, professional knowledge and technology are necessary conditions for creative inventions, but sometimes they can restrict thinking activities. Engineering and technical personnel have a high technical level, so they consider problems more deeply and comprehensively, which is an advantage. However, they are often easily restricted by their knowledge and fall into complex principle and mechanism designs. For example, when automation is involved, they are easily associated with gear screw systems, while workers with practical experience can often think of simpler and more practical principles and mechanisms, such as material grabbing rods and other devices. From this fact, when looking at the three-combination form in the current technological revolution movement, one can appreciate the superiority of this combination, because it can complement each other's strengths and make creative innovation progress more smoothly.
    Third, creative activities are developed and improved in practice. For example, when the machine is running, the space-time relationship of each part is constantly changing, which is different from when it is stationary. We observed that workers with insufficient experience do not consider these changes in space-time relationship when they start designing new machine parts, resulting in rework. In further practice, they not only corrected their mistakes, but also foresaw the situations that might occur in the future. In this way, their thinking methods are gradually improved in practice, and the machine parts they create are gradually improved.
    The above smashed the bourgeois psychological fallacies that creative inventions are only the special rights of a few "geniuses," that they are "unpredictable," cannot be planned, and cannot be completed within a time limit, and affirmed the following experiences.
    First, creative inventions can be planned. We can completely arrange inventions and creations in a planned and step-by-step manner according to specific situations and needs, carry out technological revolution, and develop the creative thinking of the masses in a predetermined direction. Because the plan is a purposeful and step-by-step action program proposed according to production needs. It is an effective measure to mobilize the enthusiasm of the masses and strengthen the directionality of thinking. At the beginning of this year, various places and factories formulated plans and steps for technological innovation and technological revolution, which undoubtedly played a great role in promoting the technological innovation and technological revolution movement.
    Second, creative inventions can be carried out collectively. Mutual inspiration in the creative process (called "opening Zhuge Liang meetings" by the masses) can promote the perfection of innovation designs, which greatly makes up for the narrowness of personal experience and the lack of technical strength, achieving twice the result with half the effort.
    Third, creative inventions can be completed within a time limit in a surprise attack under certain circumstances. Lenin once said: Revolution "is realized when all the intelligence and talent of man is particularly high and tense, by the consciousness, will, enthusiasm and ideals of millions of people motivated by the most acute class struggle." "At no other time do the people show themselves as active creators of a new social system as in the period of revolution, and in such a period the people are able to perform miracles that seem inconceivable from the narrow point of view of philistine gradualism." Human thinking activities have exactly such characteristics. When objective circumstances force people to complete urgent tasks, the thinking activities of the human brain are in an active state, which is often the most vigorous time for creative activities, and it is easy to obtain rich results. The employees of the Shanghai Rolling Mill, in order not to allow the Haiyan Film Studio to film the backward situation of the Lianhua Strip Steel Factory before the Four Modernizations movement, were determined to engage in technological innovation and technological revolution on a large scale, and in four days, the entire factory was completely renewed, finally forcing the Haiyan Film Studio to find another "object." This vivid example confirms the correctness of the above principles.
                  Future Work Direction
    At present, the technological innovation and technological revolution movement is continuing to develop in depth. Generally speaking, it includes two major links: one is creation, and the other is promotion (consolidation, improvement). We believe that for labor psychology, there is rich research content in these two major links.
    First, the issue of correctly proposing topics. Generally speaking, the most effective way to innovate and create is through the three-combination form, where the leaders propose the topic and the masses besiege it. The question here is: on the one hand, how can leaders most keenly recognize the objective needs of technological development and propose topics according to the development of the situation? Here is the question of how subjectivity can quickly and correctly reflect objectivity. On the other hand, how can leaders make the topics they propose most profoundly grasped by the working masses - the people who directly participate in creative activities - so that their designs and creations can most effectively promote the solution of the topic? This involves the question of what form of expression to use to exchange thinking content in order to achieve unified understanding.
    Second, the issue of the shortest route for creative inventions. In many cases of creative innovation, it can often be seen that people need to go through hundreds of experiments to achieve success, and then reform is carried out again because this creation still cannot meet the needs. The question here is: is it necessary to have so many experiments? Can more practical new machines be created in less time? For example, Comrade Wang Linhe of Shanghai Huguang Scientific Instrument Factory created a 10,000-volt high-voltage bridge, which was successfully tested 371 times. However, its large size and complex circuit made production far behind demand. Later, Comrade Xie Wen went through countless experiments and simplified it through transformation. For this type of process, if it is possible to study the regularity of its thinking activities, find out the common laws of its success and failure reasons, and summarize several principles and principles of "inventive invention essentials," then it will definitely bring great benefits to the early completion of innovative tasks.
    Third, the issue of promoting creative innovation results. How to consolidate, promote and improve innovation projects is a problem that urgently needs to be solved in the current technological innovation and technological revolution movement. This contains many detailed issues. First of all, the new machine must be linked to the new operating method, which involves the issue of improving technical level. For example, for any new machine or new operating method, mastering it always takes a process and needs to overcome many old habits; in addition, the newly reformed machine inevitably has imperfect aspects, which easily leads to people's denial. Therefore, in order to master the principles and performance of the new machine, workers must overcome the influence of habitual forces. Labor psychology also studies the issue of skilled skills. Generally speaking, people with more "flexible" reactions are more likely to change old habits to adapt to new situations; people with "slow" reactions can also adapt to new methods through efforts. In addition, the different workers' existing knowledge and experience, their interest in new machines, and other factors all affect the speed of their "changing old habits" process to varying degrees. It can be inferred that people in different situations must have different characteristics in the methods and ways they change their habits. How to create good objective conditions for them according to these characteristics and promote them to quickly adapt to new situations is a question of practical significance.
    Secondly, whether the new machines and tools are suitable for human characteristics is also something to consider. There is a special subject in labor psychology called "engineering psychology." Simply put, engineering psychology mainly studies how the arrangement and design of machines, instruments, etc. do not violate human physiological and psychological characteristics. For example, some machine designs distribute the operating switches, handles, etc. too dispersedly, which will inevitably cause people to make more turning movements during operation, which not only affects production efficiency but also easily increases fatigue. Also, there are many considerations in the arrangement of instrument panels as a basis for operation. Inappropriate arrangements (mainly referring to those that are not suitable for human visual conditions) will reduce efficiency and even lead to operational errors. All of this does not conform to human physiological and psychological characteristics, and therefore will affect the promotion of creative inventions.
    In addition, often in some interrelated production series, one link implements automatic production, and efficiency increases greatly, while other links cannot keep up, which affects the continued application of automatic production in this link. Another situation is that after single-machine automation, various contradictions may also occur between machine specialization and generalization, between large batches and multiple varieties, and between single-machine automation and automatic lines. The principle of active balance and continuous revolution is, of course, the primary method to solve these contradictions. This requires specific analysis of these contradictions. This involves the relationship between people and things, things and things, and people and people (such as labor organization). Correctly handling these relationships can ensure the continuous development of the technological innovation and technological revolution movement. These are also issues of interest to labor psychology workers. We once studied the issue of how to reasonably arrange the labor organization of each job on the assembly line of the installation workshop in a certain electron tube factory, and found that this kind of work line is the most capable of maintaining a tense rhythm of production. Through timing analysis, we helped the workers adjust the organization, which made the efficiency of this assembly line 56% higher than before. In addition, in the process of consolidation, promotion, and improvement, through the solution of the above specific contradictions, new creations and innovations are bound to be brewing, which is the necessary step for the technological revolution movement to continue to develop, and therefore it is also the most important link. Here, there are also many psychological problems included in the creative process that we mentioned earlier.
    In short, these two major links of the technological innovation and technological revolution movement - creation and promotion - provide labor psychology with richly content research topics. If labor psychology can cooperate with engineering and technical personnel and other relevant units, go deep into reality, closely contact the working masses, and further summarize and study these topics, then it will definitely be able to make more valuable contributions in promoting the development of the technological innovation and technological revolution movement and enriching the content of labor psychology.

　　技术革命中的劳动心理学问题
　　方芸秋
    技术革新和技术革命运动向劳动心理学提出了许多新的问题。因此，劳动心理学工作者应当考虑，如何解决这些现实问题，让劳动心理学更好地为技术革新和技术革命运动服务，并使劳动心理学自身得到进一步的发展。
              对创造性思维的初步研究
    在技术革新和技术革命运动中，劳动心理学工作者首先应当总结和研究人们进行创造性活动的规律，即：什么样的客观条件才能最有利地促进主观能动性——积极的创造性思维——的充分发挥？怎样才能最大限度地缩短创造过程？如何才能使不断革命的口号最有效地成为工人群众的现实行动？等等。
    关于技术革新和技术革命运动中的创造性思维活动，中国科学院心理研究所劳动心理组先后在上海华通开关厂、北京开关厂和长辛店机车厂进行过一些研究。例如，在北京开关厂和长辛店机车厂，研究者和工人群众一起工作，详细地记录了创造过程中思维活动的情况和规律，制出了多付自动冲模，并解决了机车厂久未解决的弹簧吊杆加工机械化问题。两个开关厂的冲压工作都因生产猛增而跟不上，以致成为全厂生产的落后环节。研究者协助工厂采取了以下几项办法促进了发明创造。
    一，分析矛盾，确定课题。我们同车间领导、技术人员和工人共同研究，明确了生产中的主要矛盾是冲压件的上下料自动化问题，确定了革新课题。二，利用“原型”启发思维（任何创造发明都要经过一定的启发，具有启发作用的事物叫做“原型”）。我们用自动化机件的示意图和简略模型，作为启发工人思考设计的原型，并在工作过程中不断给以语言启示，诱导创造者的思路。三，边想边做，逐步提高。人的认识是逐步提高的，因此我们在华通厂利用了人的这一思维活动的发展规律，先向工人提出较简单的课题。原型只是一个半自动化的简单冲模自动机构的示意图，工人在这个基础上创造了更为高级的全部自动化的冲模。最后，我们把创造出来的百余付自动冲模作了一次展览。有的工人就以自动化冲模为原型，创造了导电片数片器，消灭了手工操作，提高效率两倍。
    通过以上工作，我们初步总结出一些关于创造性思维活动的发展规律。
    一，“原型”在启发创造性思维中有很大的积极作用，但是需要选择适当，否则反而会起限制作用。一般说来，原型越接近于要创制的机件，启发作用越大。但是我们也观察到，有的原型过于具体，致使设计接近于模仿而减弱了创造性。例如我们将华通厂工人先制出来的自动冲模的照片作为原型的一部分交给北京开关厂的工人，他们在设计时反而受到了较多的限制。
    二，专业知识和技术是创造发明的必要条件，但是有时反而会限制思维活动。工程技术人员有较高的技术水平，所以在考虑问题时比较深入全面，这是一个优点。但是，他们往往容易受其知识的限制，而陷入复杂的原理和机构的设想。例如一牵涉到自动化，他们就容易联系到齿轮丝杠系统，而富于实际经验的工人则往往能够想出更为简单实用的原理和机构，如抓料杆等装置。从这一事实出发来看目前技术革命运动中的三结合形式，就能体会到这种结合的优越性，因为它可以互相补长去短，使创造革新进展得更为顺利。
    三，创造性活动是在实践中发展和提高的。例如，机器在运转时，各部分的时空关系不断变化，是不同于静止时的。我们观察到经验不足的工人在开始设计新机件时，考虑不到这些时空关系的变化，因而造成返工。在进一步的实践中，他们就不仅改正了错误，而且预见到以后可能发生的情况。这样，他的思想方法在实践中就逐步地提高了，所创制的机件也就逐步地完善起来。
    以上这些，粉碎了资产阶级心理学关于创造发明只是少数“天才”的特殊权，“可遇而不可求”，既不能计划，也不能限期完成等等谬论，而肯定了以下的经验。
    一，创造发明可以有计划地布置。我们完全可以根据具体情况和需要，有目的地有步骤地布置发明创造，进行技术革命，使群众的创造性思维朝着既定的方向发展。因为，计划是根据生产需要提出的有目的、有步骤的行动纲领，它是调动群众积极性，加强思维的指向性的有效措施。今年初，各地各厂纷纷订立了技术革新和技术革命的规划步骤，无疑地就对促进技术革新和技术革命运动起了很大的作用。
    二，创造发明可以集体进行。在创造过程中的相互启发（群众称之为“开诸葛亮会”），可以促进革新设计的完善化，这样就大大弥补了个人经验的狭隘性和技术力量不足等困难，做到事半功倍。
    三，创造发明在一定情况下可以用突击方式限期完成。列宁曾经说过：革命“是在人的一切聪明才智特别高涨和紧张的时候，由千百万被最尖锐的阶级斗争所激励的人的意识、意志、热情和理想来实现的”。“民众在其它任何时候都不如革命时期这样能表现为新社会制度底积极创造者，在这样的时期，人民能够作出从市侩渐进主义狭小眼光看来是不可思议的奇迹”。人的思维活动正具有这样的特点。当客观情势迫使人们需要完成紧急任务时，人脑的思维活动处于积极活跃的状态，这往往是创造性活动最旺盛的时机，容易获得丰富的成果。上海压延厂的职工为了不让海燕电影制片厂到他们的工厂拍摄联华带钢厂四化运动前落后状况的镜头，就发愤大搞技术革新和技术革命，在四天内使全厂面貌焕然一新，终于使得海燕电影制片厂不得不另找“对象”。这个生动例子就证实了上述原理的正确性。
                  今后的工作方向
    目前，技术革新和技术革命运动正在继续深入发展。总的说来，它包括两大环节，一是创造，一是推广（巩固、提高）。我们认为对于劳动心理学来说，在这两大环节中有着丰富的研究内容。
    一，正确地提出课题的问题。一般说来，革新创造最有效的办法是通过三结合的形式，往往是领导出题目，群众来围攻。这里的问题是：一方面，领导者如何根据形势的发展，最锐敏地认识到技术发展的客观需要，提出课题。这里有主观如何迅速地正确地反映客观的问题。另一方面，领导者如何使所出的题目最深刻地为工人群众——直接参加创造活动的人们——所掌握，以便他们的设计、创造最有效地推动课题的解决。这里牵涉到用怎样的表达形式来交换思维内容，以达到统一认识的问题。
    二，进行创造发明的最短途径的问题。在许多创造革新的事例中，往往可以看到人们需要经过几百次的试验才能取得成功，后来又因这一创造仍不能满足需要而又复进行改革。这里的问题是：是不是一定需要有那么多次的试验？能不能用更少的时间创造出更实用的新机器来？例如，上海沪光科学仪器厂王林鹤同志创制的万伏高压电桥，试验三百七十一次成功了。但是，它的体积庞大，线路复杂，以致使生产远赶不上需要。后来，谢文同志又经过无数次试验，加以改造简化。对于这类过程，如果能够研究其思维活动的规律性，找出其成功和失败原因的共同规律，总结出若干“创造发明要领”的原则原理，那就一定能够为提前完成革新任务带来很大好处。
    三，推广创造革新成果的问题。如何使革新项目得以巩固、推广和提高，是当前技术革新和技术革命运动中亟需解决的一个问题。这里包含着许多细致的问题。首先，新的机器必然同新的操作方法相联系，这里面有提高技术水平的问题。例如，任何一个新的机器，新的操作方法，掌握它总要有一个过程，需要克服许多旧习惯；再加上新改革的机器必然有不够完善的地方，就容易为人们所否定。因此，工人要掌握新机器的原理和性能，就必然要克服习惯势力的影响。劳动心理学也研究熟练技巧问题。一般地说，反应较“灵活”的人，比较容易改变旧习惯以适应新情况；反应“迟缓”的人，经过努力也能适应新方法。并且，不同工人的旧有知识经验及其对新机器的兴趣等等因素，都不同程度地影响着他们“改旧换新”过程的速度。可以推想，情况不同的人改变自己习惯的方法和途径也一定各有特点。如何针对这些特点，为他们创造良好的客观条件，促使他们很快地适应新情况，乃是一个具有实际意义的问题。
    其次，新的机器、工具是否适合于人的特点，这也是需要考虑的。劳动心理学中有一专门的课题，叫做“工程心理学”。简单说来，工程心理学主要是研究机器、仪表等的安排、设计如何不违反人的生理、心理的特点。例如，有的机器设计将操纵的开关、手把等分得过于零散，这就势必使人在操作时要做较多的转身动作，不仅影响生产效率，而且容易增加疲劳。又如，作为操纵依据的仪表盘的安排，也有许多讲究。安排得不适当（主要指不适合于人的视觉条件），就会降低效率，甚至导致操作错误。如此种种就不符合人的生理、心理的特点，因而都会影响创造发明的推广。
    此外，往往在一些相互有关的生产系列中，某一环节实行了自动生产，效率大增，而其他环节却跟不上，这就影响了这一环节自动生产的继续应用。另一种情况是，单机自动化以后，机器的专门化同通用化之间、大批量同多品种之间、单机自动同自动线之间，也会出现各种各样的矛盾。用积极的平衡、不断革命的原则，当然是解决这类矛盾的首要方法。这就需要对于这些矛盾作具体的分析。这里牵涉到人同物、物同物、以及人同人（例如劳动组织）之间的关系问题。正确地处理这些关系，就能够保证技术革新和技术革命运动不断地向前发展。这些也是劳动心理学工作者感到兴趣的问题。我们曾经在某电子管厂装架工段的流水线上，研究过流水线各工种如何合理安排劳动组织的问题，发现这样的工作线是最能保持紧张的节奏生产的。我们通过计时分析，帮助工人调整了组织以后，就使这条流水线的工效比以往提高了56％。还有，在巩固、推广和提高的过程中，通过上述各具体矛盾的解决，必然酝酿着新的创造和革新，这就是技术革命运动得以不断向前发展的必经步骤，因而也是最重要的环节。这里同样也存在着我们前面所讲过的创造过程中包括的许多心理学问题。
    总之，技术革新和技术革命运动的这两大环节——创造和推广，为劳动心理学提供了内容丰富的研究课题。劳动心理学如果能够配合工程技术人员及其他有关单位，深入实际，密切联系工人群众，对这些课题作进一步的总结和研究，那就必定能够在促进技术革新和技术革命运动的发展，以及丰富劳动心理学的内容等方面，作出更有价值的贡献。
