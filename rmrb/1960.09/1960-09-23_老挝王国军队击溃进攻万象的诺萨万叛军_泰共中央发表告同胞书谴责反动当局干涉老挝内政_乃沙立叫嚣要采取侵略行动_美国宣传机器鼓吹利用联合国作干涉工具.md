Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 22nd -- According to a broadcast by Vientiane Radio tonight, the Royal Lao Army this morning defeated two battalions of the Phoumi Nosavan rebel troops attacking Vientiane in the Xieng Nguen area of Vientiane Province, and completely recovered the Xieng Nguen area.

The radio said that the rebel troops were intercepted by the Royal Government Army yesterday in the area north of Xieng Nguen and retreated to Xieng Nguen. This morning, the Royal Army attacked Xieng Nguen and defeated the rebel troops. The radio said that the General Headquarters of the Government Army has issued an appeal to the defeated rebel troops, urging them to surrender immediately.

Xinhua News Agency, September 21st -- Bangkok Dispatch: The Thai people strongly oppose the Sarit Thanarat reactionary clique's increasingly blatant interference in Laos under the instigation of U.S. imperialism.

According to Thai newspapers such as "Bangkok Post" and "Thai Daily," the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Thailand recently issued a letter to Thai compatriots, strongly condemning the Sarit Thanarat reactionary clique's brutal interference in Lao internal affairs.

Prior to this, leaflets criticizing the Sarit Thanarat government's interference in Lao internal affairs had already appeared in various parts of Thailand. According to "Thai Daily," since the coup in Laos on August 9th, many school teachers, government officials, and workers in the capital Bangkok and various provinces have received such leaflets.

In order to suppress the discontent of the Thai people, the Sarit Thanarat authorities have recently taken frantic persecution actions. According to newspaper reports, from September 14th to 19th, the Thai police authorities dispatched a large number of police officers and arrested more than a dozen Thai people on the "crime" of "distributing communist leaflets," including government officials, teachers, university students, and former members of the Economic Party. The news said that the Thai authorities are continuing their search and arrest operations.

Xinhua News Agency, September 22nd -- Bangkok Dispatch: Thai Prime Minister Sarit Thanarat delivered a radio speech on the evening of the 21st, arrogantly clamoring that Thailand would take action to interfere in Lao internal affairs.

After routinely fabricating a series of lies about the so-called "communist threat" in Laos, Sarit said that he hoped to receive the assistance and cooperation of the "free world" (in terms of interfering in Laos' actions). He said that this was "fighting for the welfare of the entire free world."

He clamored that Thailand would "decide for itself" to take all possible actions, "regardless of whether there will be any help from any side."

Sarit was very panicked by the Thai people's struggle against the Thai reactionary government's interference in Lao internal affairs. He said that the Thai government had arrested some people who participated in these activities.

Sarit also denied Thailand's aggressive act of shelling Vientiane on September 18th. The Royal Lao Government has formally protested to Thailand about this matter.

Xinhua News Agency, September 21st -- Bangkok Dispatch: Thai reactionary newspapers, in coordination with the U.S. imperialist and Southeast Asia Treaty Organization's aggressive conspiracies, are clamoring for the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization's aggressive group to take action to interfere in Lao internal affairs.

The Thai official newspaper "Free Communications Daily" published an editorial on the 17th, imitating the U.S. State Department's statement of the thief crying "stop thief," saying that the tense situation in Laos was "due to the entry of foreign communist armed forces into the Lao civil war." The editorial echoed the traitorous Phoumi Nosavan group in Laos, clamoring that Nosavan's request for the "free world" to provide assistance "or to ask anti-communist organizations to help defend the country's independence" was "necessary."

Another official newspaper, "Thai Daily," in order to find an excuse for the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization's aggressive group to interfere in Laos, insisted that the situation in Laos was related to the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization. It said: If Laos (the Nosavan traitorous group) requests assistance, "Southeast Asia Treaty Organization member states must provide assistance in accordance with the organization's regulations."

The pro-American "Honor Daily" also clamored that the Southeast Asia aggressive group "should take measures as quickly and extremely resolutely as possible."

Xinhua News Agency, September 21st -- While the United States and its running dog in Southeast Asia, the Thai reactionary government, are deploying troops and clamoring for armed intervention in Laos, the U.S. propaganda machine and Thai officials are also clamoring for the United Nations to interfere in Lao internal affairs.

Associated Press issued dispatches from Tokyo for two consecutive days on the 20th and 21st, advocating the conspiracy to interfere in Laos through the United Nations. This news agency said on the 21st, "The United Nations may once again need to use its good offices to resolve the current crisis."

The dispatch also quoted an "American who is currently in Tokyo and has lived in this region (Laos) for many years and closely watched the development of the situation" as saying that in the current situation, "only on the grounds that communists - or Thais - interfere in Lao internal affairs" can the United Nations be asked to intervene. This "American who did not want to be named" also said that the United Nations intervention "may stop the war in Laos" and "lay the foundation for a general election."

According to Bangkok sources, Thai Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defense Thanom Kittikachorn said on the 19th with ulterior motives that the current situation in Laos is "similar" to that in the Congo. He denied Thailand's interference in Lao internal affairs and expressed his welcome for the United Nations to send representatives to "investigate" Laos' accusations against Thailand's interference in Lao internal affairs.

The Southeast Asia aggressive group council controlled by the United States held another meeting at its headquarters in Bangkok on the 20th to plot a conspiracy to interfere in Lao internal affairs. A spokesman concealed that this was "completely a routine meeting." But according to Agence France-Presse, the Thai representative attending the meeting met with Thai Prime Minister Sarit Thanarat on the 19th, and it is widely believed that he will raise the issue of the situation in Laos at the council meeting.

　　老挝王国军队击溃进攻万象的诺萨万叛军
  　泰共中央发表告同胞书谴责反动当局干涉老挝内政
    乃沙立叫嚣要采取侵略行动　美国宣传机器鼓吹利用联合国作干涉工具
    新华社河内22日电　据万象电台今晚广播，老挝王国军队今天早晨在万象省西南北汕地区击溃了向万象市进攻的富米·诺萨万叛军两个营，并全部收复了北汕地区。
    电台说，叛军昨天在北汕以北地区受到王国政府军队的阻击，退回北汕。今晨王国军队进击北汕，打垮了叛军。电台说，政府军队总司令部已向被击溃的叛军发出呼吁，要他们立即投降。
    新华社21日讯　曼谷消息：泰国人民强烈反对乃沙立反动集团在美帝国主义唆使下，日益明目张胆地干涉老挝的行为。
    据“曼谷邮报”、“泰日报”等泰国报纸报道，泰国共产党中央委员会最近发表告泰国同胞书，强烈谴责乃沙立反动集团粗暴干涉老挝内政的行为。
    在这以前，泰国各地就已出现抨击乃沙立政府干涉老挝内政的传单。据“泰日报”报道，自从8月9日老挝发生政变以来，首都曼谷和内地各府的许多学校教员、政府公务员和工人群众都收到了这种传单。
    为了压制泰国人民的不满情绪，乃沙立当局最近采取了疯狂的迫害行动。据报纸报道，从9月14日至19日，泰国警察当局出动大批警察，以“散发共产党传单”的“罪名”，先后逮捕了十几名泰国人士，其中包括政府公务员、教员、大学生和前经济人党党员。消息说，泰国当局还在继续进行搜捕中。
    新华社22日讯　曼谷消息：泰国总理乃沙立21日晚发表广播谈话，狂妄地叫嚷泰国要采取行动干涉老挝内政。
    乃沙立照例地捏造一通所谓在老挝存在“共产党威胁”的谎言之后说，他希望（在干涉老挝的行动方面）得到“自由世界”的援助和合作。他说，这是“为整个自由世界的福利而战”。
    他叫嚷说，泰国将“自行决定”采取一切可能的行动，“不考虑是否将有任何方面的帮助”。
    乃沙立对泰国人民反对泰国反动政府干涉老挝内政的斗争十分恐慌。他说，泰国政府已经逮捕了一些参加这些活动的人。
    乃沙立还抵赖泰国9月18日炮击万象的侵略行动。老挝王国政府已经就这件事向泰国正式提出抗议。
    据新华社21日讯　曼谷消息：泰国反动报纸，配合美帝国主义和东南亚条约组织的侵略阴谋，大肆叫嚣要东南亚条约侵略集团采取行动，干涉老挝内政。
    泰国官方报纸“自由通讯报”17日发表社论，模仿着美国国务院声明中贼喊捉贼的陈词滥调，说什么老挝紧张局势是“由于外国共产党的武装力量进入老挝内战”。社论同老挝的富米·诺萨万叛国集团相呼应，叫嚷诺萨万要求“自由世界”给予援助，“或者要求抱有反共宗旨的机构来帮助保卫国家的独立”是“有必要的”。
    另一家官方报纸“泰日报”为了给东南亚条约侵略集团干涉老挝寻找口实，硬说老挝局势是同东南亚条约组织有关的。它说：如果老挝（诺萨万叛国集团）要求给予援助时，“东南亚条约组织成员国就必须按照这个组织的规定给予援助”。
    亲美的“荣誉报”也叫嚣东南亚侵略集团“应当尽可能迅速和极其坚决地采取措施”。
    新华社21日讯　在美国和它在东南亚的走卒泰国反动政府调兵遣将，叫嚣武装干涉老挝的同时，美国的宣传机器和泰国的官员又叫嚷要联合国出面干涉老挝内政。
    美联社20日、21日一连两天从东京发出电讯，鼓吹通过联合国干涉老挝的阴谋。这家通讯社21日说，“联合国可能再一次需要利用它的斡旋解决目前的危机。”
    这则电讯还引述了一个现在东京而过去曾“在这个地区（老挝）居住多年并且密切注视事态发展的美国人”的话说，在目前情况下，“只有以共产党人——或泰国人——干涉老挝内政为理由”，才能要求联合国干涉。这位“不愿透露姓名的美国人”又说，联合国的干预“可能停止老挝的战争”，“为大选打下基础”。
    据曼谷消息，泰国副总理兼国防部长乃他侬19日别有用心地说，目前老挝局势同刚果“近似”。他抵赖泰国干涉老挝内政，并且表示欢迎联合国派代表来“调查”老挝对泰国干涉老挝内政的指责。
    美国控制的东南亚侵略集团理事会20日再次在曼谷总部举行会议，策划干涉老挝内政的阴谋。一位发言人掩饰说，这“完全是例行会议”。但是据法新社报道，泰国参加会议的代表19日会见了泰国总理乃沙立，人们普遍相信他将在理事会上提出老挝局势问题。
