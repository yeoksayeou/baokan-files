Xinhua News Agency, Lhasa, September 5th: Autumn harvesting is in full swing in the main agricultural areas of Tibet, including Lhasa, Shannan, Nyingchi, and Qamdo.

Currently, the early-maturing crops in the Lhasa, Shannan, and Qamdo agricultural areas have been harvested. In Nyingchi Prefecture, which has a mild climate, the crops in counties such as Nyingchi, Bomi, and Mainling have been mostly harvested. In the later-season Shigatse and Gyantse Prefectures, grain crops are also gradually ripening. There, Tibetan farmers are not only successively harvesting early-maturing highland barley, but also actively carrying out various autumn harvest preparations.

This year is the first year of a great harvest since the democratic reforms in Tibet. Judging from the current threshing situation in various places, the harvest is significantly greater than in any previous year. Some mountain valleys and slopes that were previously barren and lacked irrigation have also achieved good harvests this year due to improved cultivation methods and a focus on water, soil, fertilizer, seeds, and field management. Many elderly Tibetan farmers say that in their sixty or seventy years, they have never seen such good crops. Pengcuo Jiandan, a ninety-year-old woman from Menggaru Township in Zhanang County, Shannan, said: Such good crops as this year were not only unseen but also unimaginable under the feudal serf system in the past. The Tibetan farmers who have obtained a bumper harvest have formed report teams, beating drums and gongs, and carrying the abundant wheat ears to report the good news to the Party. When "tasting the new grain," they first wrapped the new tsampa with white hadas and presented it to Chairman Mao's portrait, thanking the Communist Party and Chairman Mao for their good leadership.

During the autumn harvest, leading cadres at all levels have gone deep into the front lines to participate in the harvest, lead the harvest, and solve problems on the spot, making this year's autumn harvest work in Tibet fast and good. Local government offices, troops, schools, urban residents, and various industries and trades have also vigorously supported the autumn harvest in various ways. At present, in Lhasa City alone, tens of thousands of people from government offices, troops, schools, and citizens have helped farmers with the autumn harvest. Industrial workers in Lhasa City have also supported the farmers with a large number of autumn harvest tools. The People's Liberation Army's assistance teams not only harvest quickly but also ensure clean harvesting, gleaning, transporting, and threshing, which has been warmly praised by Tibetan farmers.

During the autumn harvest, mutual aid teams in various places formed specialized teams for harvesting, gleaning, transporting, and threshing, giving full play to the superiority of organized collective production. Before the harvest, each mutual aid team discussed in detail the measures and methods for rapid and successful harvesting, rationally arranged labor, and scheduled the harvesting dates for each plot of land according to their ripeness. Many mutual aid teams also established nurseries for busy farming seasons. In Luolang Village, Nimu County, Lhasa, collective labor division and the assignment of experienced farmers for careful harvesting and threshing resulted in an additional nineteen jin of grain per ke (equivalent to one mu). The masses universally praised the benefits of organizing for mutual aid and cooperation. Many villages have put forward the resounding slogan "Two and a half months for the autumn harvest in previous years, fifteen days for the autumn harvest this year." Farmers in Chejin and Hongqi townships in the eastern suburbs of Lhasa City harvested eight thousand ke of highland barley in five days, and threshed and stored it as they harvested. Farmers in various places have used newly made sickles, stone rollers, winnowing machines, and threshers in this year's autumn harvest, greatly accelerating the progress of the autumn harvest.

During this year's autumn harvest, farmers in various places have universally promoted the spirit of socialist cooperation. Areas with late harvests supported areas with early harvests, and areas with more labor supported areas with less labor. The emancipated peasants in various places also launched labor competitions during the autumn harvest.

    民主改革劳动互助带来生产大发展
    西藏农业区收成空前好
    农民在“尝新”的时候，首先用雪白的哈达包着新糌粑献给毛主席像，感谢共产党和毛主席的领导
    新华社拉萨5日电　西藏高原上的拉萨、山南、林芝、昌都等主要农业区的秋收工作全面展开。
    目前，拉萨、山南和昌都农业区的早熟庄稼已经收割完毕。在气候温和的林芝专区的林芝、波密、米林等县，庄稼已经大部收割完毕。季节较晚的日喀则、江孜专区的粮食作物也逐渐成熟，那里的藏族农民们除了陆续开镰收割早熟地上的青稞外，正在积极进行各项秋收准备工作。
    今年是西藏民主改革以后的第一个大丰收年，从目前各地打场的情况来看，都比以往任何一年大大增加。一些过去土壤贫瘠和缺水灌溉的山谷、坡地，由于改进了耕作方法，大抓水、土、肥、种和田间管理，今年也获得了丰收。许多藏族老农民都说他们活了六、七十岁，从来没有看见过像今年这样好的庄稼。山南扎囊县孟噶如乡九十岁的老阿妈彭措坚丹说：像今年这样好的庄稼，过去在封建农奴制度下不仅没有看见过，连想都没想到。获得丰收的藏族农民们纷纷组成报喜队，敲锣打鼓，抱着丰硕的麦穗向党报喜。他们在“尝新”的时候，首先用雪白的哈达包着新糌粑献给毛主席像，感谢共产党和毛主席的好领导。
    秋收中，各级领导干部都深入第一线，一方面参加秋收，一方面领导秋收，就地解决问题，使得今年西藏地区的秋收工作作得又快又好。各地机关、部队、学校、城市居民和各行各业也从各方面大力支援秋收。目前，仅拉萨市机关、部队、学校和市民帮助农民秋收的已达上万人次，拉萨市的手工业工人还支援了农民大批秋收工具。人民解放军的助收队不但割得快，而且作到了收净、拾净、运净和打净，受到藏族农民的热烈赞扬。
    秋收中，各地都以互助组为单位，分别组成了收割、拾穗、运输、打场等专业队伍，充分发挥了组织起来集体生产的优越性。收割前，各互助组都详细讨论了收快收好的措施和办法，合理安排了劳动力，并把每块庄稼地的收割日期，按成熟先后排了队，很多互助组还成立了农忙托儿站。拉萨尼木县罗浪村由于集体分工劳动，抽调经验丰富的农民精收精打，使每克地（相当一亩）多收粮食十九斤。群众普遍赞扬说组织起来搞互助合作就是好。许多乡村都提出了“往年秋收两月半，今年秋收十五天”的响亮口号。拉萨市东郊彻金、红旗两个乡的农民五天就收割了八千克青稞，并随收、随打、随入仓。各地农民在今年的秋收中使用了新制的镰刀、石磙、风车和脱粒机等工具，大大加快了秋收进度。
    各地农民在今年的秋收中，普遍发扬了社会主义协作精神，晚收的地区支援了早收的地区，劳动力多的地区支援了劳动力少的地区。各地翻身农民还在秋收中展开了劳动竞赛。
