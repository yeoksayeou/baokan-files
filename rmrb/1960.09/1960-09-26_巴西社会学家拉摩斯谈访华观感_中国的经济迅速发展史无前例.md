Xinhua News Agency, Rio de Janeiro, September 24th: Brazilian sociologist Lareiro Lemos, who recently visited China, gave a report on his visit to China at the Brazilian Press Association Auditorium on the evening of the 22nd. The report was organized by the Brazil-China Cultural Exchange Association.

In his report, Lemos used specific figures to illustrate China's rapid economic development and the enormous growth of national income. These figures show that the growth of national income is unprecedented.

In analyzing China's astonishing economic development, Lemos pointed out that the main reason is that the Chinese people, who are masters of their own affairs, have a high degree of enthusiasm for economic development, and at the same time, economic development is carried out under planned leadership. In his report, he also elucidated the main achievements China has made in various fields, such as the reduction of mortality rates and the extension of people's life expectancy. Lemos then said: Having seen the examples of China and the Soviet Union, Brazil cannot continue to remain in its current backward state. Lemos praised the Cuban Revolution. He called for uniting with underdeveloped countries in Asia and Africa, establishing trade relations with socialist countries, and formulating new regulations on foreign investment and the outflow of profits by foreign companies.

　  巴西社会学家拉摩斯谈访华观感
　　中国的经济迅速发展史无前例
    新华社24日讯　里约热内卢消息：最近访问过中国的巴西社会学家拉雷罗·拉摩斯22日晚在巴西新闻协会礼堂作了关于访问中国的报告，这次报告会是由巴西—中国文化交流协会组织的。
    拉摩斯在报告中用具体的数字说明中国经济的迅速发展和国民收入的巨大增长。这些数字表明国民收入的增长是史无前例的。
    在分析中国经济的惊人发展时，拉摩斯指出：主要的原因是当家作主的中国人民对经济的发展怀着高度的热情，同时经济的发展是在有计划的领导之下进行的。他在报告中还阐明了中国在各个方面所取得的主要成就，例如死亡率的减少、人民寿命的延长等等。拉摩斯接着又说：看到了中、苏两国的榜样，巴西不能继续停留在目前的落后状态中。拉摩斯赞扬了古巴革命。他要求同亚非不发达国家联合起来，同社会主义国家建立贸易关系，并且要求对外国的投资和外国公司把利润外流等问题制订新的规定。
