Xinhua News Agency, 20th. The U.S. conspiracy to interfere in Laos is being actively pursued. According to the Associated Press, U.S. Naval Forces Commander in the Philippines, Carson, when talking about the situation in Laos on the 19th, said that the U.S. Seventh Fleet "is fully prepared to take action." Carson threatened: "At least one aircraft carrier is now patrolling the South China Sea, and its aircraft can attack any location in the region."
　　He used the usual U.S. anti-communist rhetoric to cover up this aggressive action, saying that "communist activities in Southeast Asia" "have further shifted the activities of the U.S. Seventh Fleet southward."
　　Echoing the U.S. clamor for intervention, the Thai government is also clamoring to take action. According to a report from United Press International from Bangkok, after the Phoumi Nosavan group, under U.S. instigation, issued a so-called "appeal" requesting foreign intervention, Thai Acting Foreign Minister Charoonchai said on the 19th that Thailand was studying this appeal and stated that "the Thai government will take action on this appeal within two or three days." Thai Deputy Interior Minister Kosol also announced on the same day a ban on the transportation of oil from Thailand to Vientiane, attempting to further blockade and besiege Vientiane.
　　News indicates that the U.S. is preparing to use the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization (SEATO), which it controls, as a tool for interfering in Laos. SEATO Secretary-General Pote Sarasin, in a statement to the press on the 17th, disregarded the Geneva Accords and included Laos within the scope of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization, saying that any events occurring within the scope of SEATO must be "taken seriously" and the development of the situation must be noted.
　　He followed the U.S. tune, saying that communists were currently "infiltrating" Laos.
　　In order to create a pretext in advance for this aggressive group to interfere in Laos, he clamored that if it is confirmed that "Communist China sends troops into Laos to interfere in Laos' internal affairs," SEATO will "take some appropriate measures" in response.
　　He revealed that the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization held a meeting on the 15th to discuss the situation in Laos. However, he refused to disclose the content of the meeting.
　　Xinhua News Agency, 19th. While the U.S. is sending warships to the South China Sea to threaten Laos with force, it is also directing the Phoumi Nosavan traitorous group to openly demand armed intervention in Laos by SEATO and the United Nations, which are controlled by the United States.
　　According to the Associated Press from Savannakhet, which is occupied by the Nosavan group, Nosavan announced to reporters on the 17th an "appeal" issued in the name of Boun Oum. This "appeal" once again played the trick of the thief crying "stop thief," wantonly slandering China and the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, and clamoring about so-called "communist aggression." This "appeal" openly requested "free countries to help" the Nosavan traitorous group so that its so-called "freedom" could prevail in this corner of the world.
　　In explaining this "appeal," Nosavan clamored that he would accept foreign troops if necessary. He said that this "appeal" was mainly addressed to "the most anti-communist organizations" and the United Nations. He also admitted that his request for "help" included SEATO, which is controlled by the United States.
　　It is reported that Nosavan once stated that he would forward this "appeal" to the United Nations and SEATO through Thailand, a member of SEATO.
　　The Thai reactionary newspaper "Honor Newspaper" also openly praised the U.S. State Department's statement openly interfering in Laos' internal affairs on the 13th, and clamored that "now the United States will immediately rise up to support it."
　　An Associated Press report from Vientiane on the 18th also advocated direct foreign intervention in Laos. It said that Laos is "a country facing division," and that "one half, although resolutely anti-communist, is too weak to win the war independently." Therefore, this American news agency clamored for "outside intervention."
　　Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 20th. Vientiane Radio broadcast today that, according to reliable sources, Captain Siho, the head of Phoumi Nosavan's intelligence office, is hiding with a thousand soldiers in Don Tan Village, Chiang Mai Province, Thailand, waiting for an opportunity to attack Vientiane. These troops include people from northeastern Thailand and Laos.
　　The radio called on the people to assist the government and report the activities of Siho's troops. It said that the Supreme Command of the Royal Lao Army is ready to defend the capital Vientiane. The radio hoped that the people would remain calm and be wary of the activities of saboteurs.
　　According to an Associated Press report from Vientiane, the capital of Laos, Vientiane, has been put on alert. The Vientiane defense forces have set up mortars along the Mekong River and roadblocks on the roads leading into the city. Some trucks loaded with soldiers left the capital and drove to defensive positions.

　　美国阴谋利用东南亚集团干涉老挝
　  诺萨万为美国武装干涉作准备叫嚷将接受外国军队
    新华社20日讯　美国干涉老挝的阴谋正在积极推行。据美联社报道，美国驻菲律宾海军部队司令卡逊在19日发表谈话谈到老挝局势时说，美国第七舰队“是充分作好了采取行动的准备的”。卡逊威胁说：“至少有一艘航空母舰现在一直在南中国海巡逻，它的飞机能够攻击这个地区的任何地点。”
    他用美国惯用的反共滥调来掩饰美国的这种侵略行动，说什么“共产党在东南亚的活动”，“使美国第七舰队的活动进一步南移了”。
    同美国的干涉叫嚣相呼应，泰国政府也叫嚷准备采取行动。据合众国际社从曼谷报道，在富米·诺萨万集团在美国指使下发表了要求外国干涉的所谓“呼吁书”后，泰国代理外长乍龙猜就在19日说，泰国正在研究这个求援呼吁，并且表示“泰国政府将在两三天内对这个呼吁采取行动”。泰国内政部副部长科索在同日还宣布禁止从泰国向万象运送石油，企图进一步封锁围困万象。
    消息表明，美国正准备利用它控制下的东南亚侵略集团来作为干涉老挝的工具。东南亚条约组织秘书长乃朴·沙拉信在17日向报界发表的谈话中竟然不顾日内瓦协议，把老挝列入东南亚侵略军事集团的范围内，说什么凡是在东南亚条约组织范围内发生的事件，东南亚条约组织都必须“重视”，并注意局势的发展。
    他跟着美国的调子，说什么目前共产党正在向老挝进行“渗透”。
    为了替这个侵略集团干涉老挝的行动预先制造借口，他叫嚷说，如果证实“共产中国派兵进入老挝干预老挝内政”时，东南亚条约组织将对此“采取某种适当的措施”。
    他透露，东南亚侵略集团曾经在15日举行会议，讨论了老挝局势问题。但是他不肯透露会议的内容。
    新华社19日讯　美国在派军舰在南中国海以武力威胁老挝的同时，又指使富米·诺萨万叛国集团公开要求美国控制的东南亚条约侵略集团和联合国武装干涉老挝。
    据美联社自诺萨万集团盘据的沙湾拿吉报道，诺萨万在17日向记者公布了一项以文翁的名义发表的“呼吁书”。这个“呼吁书”再次玩弄贼喊捉贼的伎俩，大肆污蔑中国和越南民主共和国，叫嚣所谓“共产党人侵略”。这份“呼吁书”公开要求“自由国家帮助”诺萨万叛国集团，以便它所谓的“自由”能在世界的这个角落得势。
    诺萨万在解释这个“呼吁书”时叫嚷说，如果有必要的话，他将接受外国军队。他说，这项“呼吁书”主要是对“最反共的组织”和联合国发出的。他还承认他要求“帮助”的包括美国控制的东南亚条约侵略集团在内。
    据报道，诺萨万曾经表示将通过东南亚条约侵略集团的泰国把这份“呼吁书”转交给联合国和东南亚条约侵略集团。
    泰国反动报纸“荣誉报”在13日也公开为美国国务院公然干涉老挝内政的声明叫好，并且叫嚷说，“现在美国将立即起而支援”。
    美联社18日自万象发出的一则报道也鼓吹外国直接干涉老挝。它说，老挝是“一个面临着分裂的国家”，“一半虽然是坚决反共的，但是太弱，不能独立打赢战争”。因此，这家美国的通讯社叫嚷要“外界进行干涉”。
    新华社河内20日电　万象电台今天广播说：据可靠消息，富米·诺萨万的情报处处长西何大尉率领的一千名军队隐藏在泰国西川迈县敦谷村，伺机进攻万象。这些军队中有泰国东北部人和老挝人。
    电台号召人民协助政府，报告西何军队的活动。它说，老挝王国军队最高指挥部已经作好准备，以保卫首都万象。电台希望人民保持镇静，并且提防破坏分子的活动。
    据美联社万象消息说，老挝首都万象已经作好戒备，万象防御部队沿湄公河架起了迫击炮，在通向市内的道路上设置了路障。一些卡车载满士兵开出首都，驶往防御阵地。
