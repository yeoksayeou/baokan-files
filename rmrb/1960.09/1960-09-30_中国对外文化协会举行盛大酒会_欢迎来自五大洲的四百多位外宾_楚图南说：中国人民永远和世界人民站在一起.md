Xinhua News Agency, September 29th: The Chinese People's Association for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries held a grand reception at the Beijing Hotel this noon to celebrate the upcoming 11th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, warmly welcoming over 400 foreign guests from the fields of culture, education, art, science, health, peace and friendship, social celebrities, news, and sports from the five continents of the world. These foreign guests are all here at our invitation to attend China's National Day celebrations and conduct friendly visits.

This was an extremely moving gathering of friendship. Friends from dozens of countries and people from all walks of life in China gathered together. The banquet hall of the Beijing Hotel was transformed into a palace of joy filled with friendship, and was constantly filled with warm applause and friendly cheers.

Chu Tunan, President of the Chinese People's Association for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries, emphasized in his speech at the reception that the Chinese people have always advocated developing friendly relations with all countries in the world on the basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. China was, is, and will continue to strive for the noble cause of peace, friendship, and common progress of the people of all countries in the world. He said that the Chinese people resolutely support the national democratic movements of the people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America, and share the fate of all oppressed people. In the common cause of opposing the US imperialist policies of aggression and war and resolutely safeguarding world peace, the Chinese people will always stand with the people of all countries in the world. His words were warmly welcomed.

Liu Changsheng, President of the Chinese-African People's Friendship Association, Zhou Erfu, Vice President of the Chinese-Latin American Friendship Association, and Jian Bozan, Vice President of the Sino-Burmese Friendship Association, successively proposed toasts, wishing the people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America continued victory in their struggles against imperialism and colonialism, wishing the people of all countries in the world friendship and unity, and wishing world peace. When toasting, Zhou Erfu also reported to the guests the good news that the Chinese and Cuban governments had decided to formally establish diplomatic relations. At this time, more than 800 Chinese and foreign guests attending the reception welcomed the news with a long-lasting storm of applause, and some Latin American friends shouted on the spot: "Yes to Cuba, no to the Yankees!"

The deep friendship between the Chinese people and the people of all countries was overflowing at the reception, which proceeded very enthusiastically. One foreign guest after another could not restrain their excitement and made impromptu speeches, expressing their deep friendship to the Chinese people and their common will to oppose imperialism and defend world peace. Emilio Portes Gil, former interim president of Mexico, sent greetings to Chairman Mao Zedong and the Chinese people. He said that the Mexican people are spiritually with the Chinese people, and he believes that one day the Mexican motherland will establish diplomatic relations with Mao Zedong's motherland, and the people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America, who are bound by the shackles of colonialism, will be liberated. After he finished speaking, many people stepped forward to shake his hand. Carlos Redelico Freire, Acting Head of the Brazilian Architects Delegation, said that China is a beautiful peace-loving country, and the Chinese people are a great people. China has shown the people of Latin America a bright future. He hopes that all Latin American countries will establish diplomatic relations with China in the future. Shinichiro Omori, head of the Japan-China Friendship Association delegation to China, said that the Japanese people must continue to resolutely fight against US imperialism. He shouted: "Down with US imperialism!" "People of all countries unite to defend world peace!"

When Peregrin Duras, the International Department Director of the Cuban newspaper "Hoy", proposed a toast, many people rushed forward and cheered repeatedly: "Cuba!" He said that at a time when Cuba is facing military aggression and economic oppression from US imperialism, the support of 650 million Chinese people is of great significance, and he expressed his heartfelt gratitude for this. He said that the Chinese people have set a glorious example of unity in the struggle of the people of the world against imperialism. He proposed a toast to the unity of the people of all countries in the world against imperialism. At this time, all the Chinese and foreign guests stood up, applauded warmly, and shouted for a long time: "Yes to Cuba, no to the Yankees!" Many Latin American guests also sang the song "We Want to Be With Cuba."

Well-known figures from all walks of life in the capital, including Bao Erhan, Nan Hanchen, Ding Xilin, Yang Hansheng, Xia Yan, Xu Guangping, Qu Wu, Fu Lianzhang, Cui Yitian, Da Pusheng, and Wang Yunsheng, attended the reception to meet and talk with the guests. Literary and art workers from the capital performed many artistic programs during the reception. The reception ended with the song "Unity is Strength."

    这是一次极为动人的友谊集会。几十个国家的各界朋友同中国的各界人士欢聚在一起。北京饭店宴会大厅变成了充满友谊的欢乐宫，这里不时响彻着热烈的掌声和友谊的欢呼声。
    中国人民对外文化协会会长楚图南在酒会上的讲话中强调说，中国人民一贯主张在和平共处五项原则的基础上同世界各国发展友好关系。中国过去是、现在是、将来也仍然要为世界各国人民的和平友好、共同进步的崇高事业而努力。他说，中国人民坚决支持亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲各国人民的民族民主运动，同一切被压迫人民同命运共呼吸。在反对美帝国主义的侵略政策和战争政策、坚决维护世界和平的共同事业中，中国人民将永远和世界各国人民站在一起。他的话受到了热烈的欢迎。
