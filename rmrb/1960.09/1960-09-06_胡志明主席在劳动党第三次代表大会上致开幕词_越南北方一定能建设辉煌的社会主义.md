Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, September 5th: Chairman Ho Chi Minh of the Central Committee of the Vietnam Workers' Party delivered an opening address today at the Third National Congress of the Vietnam Workers' Party. The full text is as follows:

Dear Comrades:

Today, our Party's Third National Congress opens at a time when all our people are joyfully celebrating the 15th anniversary of the founding of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. Attending this Party Congress are five hundred delegates representing 500,000 Party members nationwide, embodying our Party's thirty years of heroic struggle tradition. On behalf of the Party Central Committee, I extend my cordial congratulations to the comrades, to all the beloved members of our Party, and to the representatives of the Vietnam Socialist Party, the Vietnam Democratic Party, and various organizations in the Vietnam Fatherland Front.

This Party Congress very happily and warmly welcomes the representatives of:

\tThe Communist Party of the Soviet Union,
\tThe Communist Party of China,
\tThe Party of Labour of Albania,
\tThe Bulgarian Communist Party,
\tThe Polish United Workers' Party,
\tThe Socialist Unity Party of Germany,
\tThe Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party,
\tThe Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party,
\tThe Romanian Workers' Party,

Dear Comrades:

Over the past thirty years, many of our comrades and compatriots have heroically sacrificed themselves for the revolution. During the War of Resistance, countless martyrs sacrificed themselves for the motherland. In the past six years, countless brave fighters in the South have also sacrificed themselves for the nation.

Our Party and our compatriots will forever cherish the outstanding sons and daughters who have fought to the end for the cause of national liberation and the ideals of communism. (Moment of silence for one minute)

It has been more than nine years since the Second Party Congress.

In these nine years, the Party has implemented the line adopted by the Second Congress, leading our people in an extremely arduous and heroic war of resistance. The momentous Dien Bien Phu victory concluded the war of aggression launched by the French colonialists with the support of US imperialism. The Geneva Accords were reached on the basis of all countries recognizing our country's independence, sovereignty, unity, and territorial integrity, restoring peace in Indochina. The North of Vietnam gained complete liberation. But six years have passed since then, and our country has still not achieved unification as stipulated in the Geneva Accords. Our government and people have always strictly fulfilled the agreements signed. However, the US-Ngo clique has deliberately divided our country and blatantly violated the Geneva Accords, so the people of South Vietnam are still living a painful life under their brutal rule.

Therefore, our people are conducting a continuous struggle to realize the peaceful reunification of the country and to liberate the South from its plight. The revolutionary struggle of our compatriots in the South is continuing to develop deeply, broadly, and powerfully. The South truly deserves the glorious title of "Iron Wall of the Motherland."

\t\t\t\t×　×　×

Since the restoration of peace, the completely liberated North has entered the stage of socialist revolution. This is a significant transformation in the Vietnamese revolution. Under the leadership of the Party, the land reform movement has been successfully completed, liberating the laboring peasants and realizing the slogan "Land to the tillers."

We have achieved victory in the cause of economic recovery and are victoriously completing the three-year plan for developing the economy and culture. We have achieved decisive victories in the socialist transformation of agriculture, handicrafts, and private capitalist industry and commerce. We have achieved many successes in agricultural and industrial production, in cultural and educational undertakings, and in further improving the people's living standards. The North of our country is increasingly strengthening as a strong base for the struggle for a unified fatherland. The great victories of the past nine years have proven that our Party's line is correct and our Party's leadership is steady. This is the victory of Marxism-Leninism in a country that has suffered from imperialist oppression and exploitation. We are worthy of the trust that the people of our country, from North to South, have placed in our Party.

Our Party can proudly say that it is the inheritor of the glorious traditions of the nation and the pioneer of our people's march towards a bright future.

\t\t\t\t×　×　×

Dear Comrades!

All these victories are not solely the merit of our Party, but are the common merit of all our compatriots. Revolution is the cause of the masses, not the personal cause of any hero. The reason our Party has achieved victory is that our Party has organized and brought into play the endless revolutionary strength of the people and has led the people to fight under the invincible banner of Marxism-Leninism.

The victory of the Vietnamese revolution is also due to the wholehearted assistance of the people of the socialist fraternal countries, especially the Soviet Union and China. On this occasion, we would like to express our heartfelt gratitude to the socialist fraternal countries, headed by the great Soviet Union. At the same time, we would like to express our sincere gratitude to the other fraternal parties, especially the French Communist Party, which has actively supported the just struggle of our people. We express our sincere thanks to the colonial peoples and the peace-loving people of the world who have consistently sympathized with and supported us.

Our Party's thirty years of struggle history have taught us:

To implement Marxism-Leninism and be absolutely loyal to the interests of the proletariat and the nation; to maintain unity and solidarity within the Party, to maintain unity and solidarity between the Communist Parties of all countries, and to maintain unity and solidarity between the countries of the socialist family—this is the most reliable guarantee of revolutionary victory.

From the past to the present, our Party has done this correctly. From now on, our Party must continue to do this correctly.

\t\t\t\t×　×　×

Dear Comrades!

Our Party has achieved many major victories, but it is not without mistakes. However, we have never concealed our mistakes. On the contrary, we have conducted sincere self-criticism and actively corrected them. We have never been intoxicated with victory or complacent. Today, relying on our own experience and the experience of fraternal parties, we are determined to strive for further progress and continuous advancement.

The current task of the Vietnamese revolution is to advance the North along the socialist road and to realize the peaceful reunification of the country, completing the national people's democratic revolution throughout the country.

The decisions of the Congress will guide our entire Party and people in building socialism victoriously in the North, enabling the North to have modern industry and agriculture, advanced culture and science, and enabling the people of our country to live increasingly well-fed and happily.

The Second Party Congress was a congress that led to victory in the War of Resistance. This Party Congress is a congress for building socialism in the North and for struggling for the peaceful reunification of the motherland.

Our people have demonstrated heroic spirit in the War of Resistance and are also demonstrating heroic spirit in the labor of building the motherland. We will surely be able to build brilliant socialism in the North of our country.

A prosperous and strong North is a strong base for the struggle for a unified country.

This Congress will further illuminate the great road of the revolutionary struggle of our people for peaceful reunification of the country.

Our nation is an integral whole. The Vietnamese state is an integral whole. Our people will surely overcome all difficulties and ensure that "the country is unified, and the North and South are one family" is realized.

Dear Comrades:

The Vietnamese revolution is part of the world's forces of peace, democracy, and socialism. The Democratic Republic of Vietnam is a member of the socialist family headed by the great Soviet Union.

We have the task of safeguarding the outpost of socialism in Southeast Asia, striving to enhance the strength of the socialist camp and making positive contributions to safeguarding peace in Southeast Asia and the world.

Today, socialism has become a powerful world system, as solid as a copper wall and an iron bastion. Our people feel extremely excited when faced with the great victory of the Soviet Union in communist construction and the great victories achieved by the Chinese people and other socialist fraternal countries in socialist construction. Our people warmly support the peaceful foreign policy and disarmament proposals of the Soviet Union and the socialist camp's fraternal countries. Our people also feel very happy when faced with the victories achieved by the people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America in the great struggle against imperialism, especially against US imperialism. It is clear that the forces of peace, democracy, national independence, and socialism in the world are already stronger than the forces of imperialism. As long as the people of the world unite closely and actively carry out the struggle, it is possible to prevent world war and realize lasting peace. The resolute struggle of the oppressed nations will surely defeat the imperialist colonialists. Socialism will eventually achieve complete victory throughout the world.

In this great cause of struggle, the solidarity between socialist countries and the unity of the Communist and Workers' Parties of all countries is of particular importance. We believe that "the Communist and Workers' Parties of all countries will continue to strengthen the unity of the countries of the world socialist system in the future, and will cherish their unity in the struggle of the people of the world for peace, security, and the victory of the great cause of Marxism-Leninism as they cherish their own eyes." (Bucharest Communiqué)

Today, imperialists can no longer run rampant and do whatever they want as they did in the past. But as long as the imperialists exist, the crisis of war still exists. The declaration of the meeting of representatives of the Communist and Workers' Parties of the socialist countries held in Moscow in 1957 has reminded us: "The Communist Parties of all countries regard the struggle for peace as their primary task... The people of all countries in the world must maintain the greatest vigilance against the danger of war caused by imperialism," and must remember that "the more extensive and consolidated the unity of various patriotic and democratic forces, the more certain their common struggle will be to achieve victory."

Our people have suffered all kinds of hardships because of imperialism, and today our territory is still divided by the US-Ngo clique, and our South is still ravaged by them. As long as we have not driven US imperialism out of the South and liberated the South from the brutal rule of the US-Ngo clique, our people will still not be able to sleep or eat in peace for a single day. Therefore, the struggle to maintain peace and reunify the country cannot be separated from the struggle against US imperialism.

In the common struggle to defend peace and national independence in Indochina, we, the Vietnamese people, resolutely support the Lao people's current heroic anti-US struggle to promote Laos' progress towards national unity, independence, unification, and peaceful neutrality. We sincerely hope that the friendship between our country and its neighboring countries, especially Cambodia and Laos, will be established and will be well developed.

Dear Comrades:

The arduous and glorious task of making contributions to defending peace in Southeast Asia and the world in the cause of socialist revolution in the North and the struggle for a unified country is now before our Party. In order to guarantee the victory of the revolution, the question of decisive significance is to further enhance the fighting capacity of our entire Party and to further bring into play our Party's leading role in all aspects of work.

From the past to the present, our Party has striven to apply Marxism-Leninism to closely link with the practice of the Vietnamese revolution. Generally speaking, our cadres and Party members have excellent revolutionary qualities. But we still have many shortcomings, such as: subjectivism, dogmatism, empiricism, bureaucratism, and individualism, etc. These shortcomings hinder the progress of our comrades. We must strive to study Marxism-Leninism, strengthen ideological education within the Party, and fight to overcome these shortcomings. We must further enhance the class nature and vanguard nature of the Party, continuously strengthen the Party's ties with the masses, and know how to unite all patriotic and progressive people in order to victoriously build socialism and strive for national unity. We must make creative efforts to learn from the experience of fraternal parties. We must be as humble as Lenin taught us and must never be proud or complacent.

This Congress of our Party will elect the Party's new Central Committee. We firmly believe that under the leadership of the new Central Committee, our entire Party will unite more closely and will more powerfully mobilize the people of the whole country to carry out the struggle in order to realize our great goal, that is:

To build socialism in the North and strive for the realization of peaceful reunification of the country.

\t\t\t\t×　×　×

Long live great Marxism-Leninism!

Long live the heroic Vietnamese working class and people!

Long live the Vietnam Workers' Party!

Long live the unity and solidarity among the fraternal parties and the unity and solidarity in the socialist family headed by the great Soviet Union!

Long live a peaceful, unified, independent, democratic, prosperous, and strong Vietnam!

Long live world peace!

    胡志明主席在劳动党第三次代表大会上致开幕词
    越南北方一定能建设辉煌的社会主义
    越南国家是一个整体，务必使“国家统一，南北一家”得到实现
    维护和平、统一国家的斗争同反对美帝国主义的斗争不可分割
    新华社河内5日电　越南劳动党中央委员会主席胡志明今天在越南劳动党第三次全国代表大会上致开幕词，全文如下：亲爱的同志们：
    今天，我们党第三次全国代表大会正值我们全体人民高兴地庆祝越南民主共和国建国十五周年纪念日的时候开幕。出席这次党大会的有代表着全国五十万党员的五百代表，体现着我们党三十年来英勇斗争的传统。我谨代表党中央，向同志们，向我们党亲爱的全体党员们，向越南祖国统一战线中的越南社会党、越南民主党和各团体的代表们，致以亲切的祝贺。
    这次我们党大会十分愉快和热烈地欢迎代表着：
    苏联共产党，
    中国共产党，
    阿尔巴尼亚劳动党，
    保加利亚共产党，
    波兰统一工人党，
    德国统一社会党，
    匈牙利社会主义工人党，
    蒙古人民革命党，
    罗马尼亚工人党，
    朝鲜劳动党，
    捷克斯洛伐克共产党，
    法国共产党，
    印度共产党，
    印度尼西亚共产党，
    日本共产党，
    加拿大共产党，
    以及其他兄弟的共产党等的代表同志们。您们已经本着崇高的国际主义精神来参加我们的大会，并给予我们带来了各兄弟党的亲切的情谊。正是：
    四海无产皆兄弟，
    万里关山一家亲。
    我谨代表大会亲切地对已经踊跃参加竞赛运动，争取成绩向党代表大会和十五周年国庆献礼的工人、农民和知识分子兄弟姊妹们以及人民军各单位、各机关干部、青年儿童们表示欢迎。
                        ×　×　×亲爱的同志们：
    三十年来，我们许多同志和同胞，曾经为革命而英勇牺牲。在抗战期间不知有多少的烈士们已为祖国而牺牲。六年来，在南方不知多少的勇敢战士也已为民族而牺牲了。
    我们党和我们同胞，永远怀念着那些已经为民族解放事业、为共产主义理想而奋斗到底的优秀儿女。（默念一分钟）
                        ×　×　×　
    从党第二次大会到今天已有九年多了。
    这九年来，党执行了第二次大会所通过的路线，领导我国人民进行极其艰苦和英勇的抗战。轰轰烈烈的奠边府大捷，已经结束了由法国殖民主义者所发动的并得到美帝国主义援助的侵略战争。在各国承认我国的独立主权、统一和领土完整的基础上已达成了日内瓦协议，恢复了印度支那的和平。越南北方获得完全解放。但是直到今天已经六年了，而我们国家仍然未能如日内瓦协议所规定的那样来实现统一。我国政府和人民一向来都严正履行所签订的协议。但是，美—吴集团则蓄意分割我国，明目张胆地破坏日内瓦协议，所以我国南方人民仍在它们残暴的统治下过着痛苦的生活。
    因此，我国人民为实现国家的和平统一，把南方从水深火热之中解放出来而进行不断的斗争。我国同胞在南方的革命斗争，正在继续、深广而强有力地发展中。南方真正不愧于“祖国的铜墙”的光荣的称号。
                          ×　×　×　
    自从恢复和平以来，获得完全解放的北方已经跨进社会主义革命阶段。这是越南革命具有重大意义的转变。在党的领导下，已经胜利地完成土地改革运动。解放了劳动农民同胞，实现了“耕者有其田”的口号。
    我们在恢复经济事业中已获得胜利，并正在胜利地完成发展经济和文化的三年计划。我们对农业、手工业和私营资本主义工商业的社会主义改造，已取得决定性的胜利。我们已经在农业和工业生产战线上、在文化教育事业中以及进一步提高人民生活等方面都取得了许多成就。我国北方正在日益加强成为统一祖国斗争的坚强基地。九年来的巨大胜利，已经证明我们党的路线是正确的，我们党的领导是稳健的。这是马克思列宁主义在一个曾经遭受帝国主义压迫和剥削的国家的胜利。对于从北到南的我国人民给予我们党的信任，于心无愧。
    我们党可以自豪是民族光荣传统的继承者，是我国人民走向灿烂未来的开路先锋。
                          ×　×　×亲爱的同志们！
    这一切的胜利，不单是我们党的功劳，它是我国全体同胞所共有的功劳。革命是群众的事业，却不是任何的英雄的个人事业。我们党所以取得胜利是在于我们党已经组织和发挥了人民无穷无尽的革命力量，已经领导了人民在战无不胜的马克思列宁主义旗帜下进行奋斗。
  越南革命的胜利还是由于社会主义各兄弟国家人民，尤其是苏联和中国的尽情帮助。趁着这个机会，我们谨向以伟大的苏联为首的社会主义兄弟国家表示衷心的谢忱。同时，我们谨向其他的兄弟党，尤其是曾经积极支援我国人民正义斗争的法国共产党表示诚挚的谢忱。我们谨对经常同情和支持我们的殖民地各民族和全世界爱好和平人民，表示真诚的感谢。
    我们党三十年的斗争历史，已经教育我们：
    贯彻马克思列宁主义，绝对忠诚于无产阶级和民族的利益；维护党内的团结一致，维护各国共产党之间的团结一致以及社会主义大家庭中各国之间的团结一致，这就是革命胜利的最可靠的保证。
    从过去到现在，我们党已经正确的这样做了。从今以后，我们党也一定要正确的这样做下去。
                          ×　×　×　亲爱的同志们！
    我们党已经取得许多重大的胜利，但并不是没有错误。不过，我们从没有掩饰过错误，相反地，我们已进行诚恳的自我批评并积极纠正错误。我们从没有因胜利而陶醉、自满。今天凭着我们本身的经验和各兄弟党的经验，我们坚决为着进一步的前进和不断的前进而奋斗。
    目前越南革命的任务是：使北方沿着社会主义的道路前进和实现和平统一国家，在全国范围内完成民族人民民主革命。
    大会的决定将引导我们全党、全民在北方胜利地建设社会主义，使北方有现代的工业和农业，有先进的文化科学，使我国人民的生活日益温饱、愉快。
    党的第二次代表大会是导致抗战胜利的大会。这次党的大会是在北方建设社会主义和为祖国和平统一而斗争的大会。
    我国人民已经在抗战中表现了英雄的气概，而在建设祖国的劳动中也表现出英雄的气概。我们一定将能够在我国北方建设辉煌的社会主义。
    富强的北方就是为统一国家而斗争的坚强基地。
    这次大会将进一步照亮我国人民和平统一国家的革命斗争的大道。
    我们的民族是一个整体。越南国家是一个整体。我们人民一定会克服一切困难，务必使“国家统一，南北一家”得到实现。
                        ×　×　×　亲爱的同志们：
    越南革命是世界和平民主与社会主义力量的一部分，越南民主共和国，是以伟大的苏联为首的社会主义大家庭中的成员之一。
    我们有对于维护社会主义在东南亚的前哨岗位的任务，努力为增强社会主义阵营力量和维护东南亚及世界和平作出积极的贡献。
    今天社会主义已经成为强大的世界体系，固如铜壁钢垒，我国人民面对着苏联在共产主义建设中的伟大胜利，中国人民及其他的社会主义兄弟国家在社会主义建设中所取得巨大的胜利，感到无比的兴奋。我国人民对苏联以及社会主义阵营的各兄弟国家的和平外交政策和裁减军备的主张，表示热烈的支持。我国人民面对着亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲各民族在反对帝国主义，尤其是反对美帝国主义的伟大斗争中所取得的胜利也感到万分高兴。很明显，世界上的和平民主、民族独立与社会主义的力量，已经比帝国主义的力量强大。只要全世界人民紧密的团结一起，积极地进行斗争，那么，一定有防止世界战争，实现持久和平的可能。被压迫各民族的坚决斗争，将必定击败帝国主义殖民者。社会主义最后必定在全世界得到完全胜利。
    在这个伟大的斗争事业中，社会主义各国之间的团结和各国共产党以及工人党之间的团结一致，是具有特别重要意义的。我们相信：“各国共产党和工人党今后仍将继续加强世界社会主义体系各国的团结，并将像爱护自己眼珠一样维护自己在世界人民争取和平、安全和马克思列宁主义伟大事业的胜利的斗争中的一致。”（布加勒斯特公报）
    今天，帝国主义者再不能像过去那样横行霸道，任所欲为了。但帝国主义者存在一天，战争的危机仍然存在。1957年在莫斯科举行的社会主义各国共产党和工人党代表大会的宣言已提醒我们：“各国共产党认为争取和平的斗争是自己的首要任务……世界各国人民对于帝国主义所造成的战争危险必须保持最大的警惕。”和必须记住“各种爱国民主力量团结得越广泛越巩固，他们的共同斗争就越有把握取得胜利。”
    我国人民曾因帝国主义而历尽了辛酸，而今天我们的国土还被美—吴集团分割，我们的南方还受它们蹂躏。一天没有把美帝国主义从南方赶出去，没有把南方从美—吴集团残暴的统治下解放出来，我国人民仍然一天也寝食不安。因此，就不可以把维护和平、统一国家的斗争跟反对美帝国主义的斗争分割开来。
    在保卫印度支那的和平和民族独立的共同斗争中，我们越南人民坚决支持老挝人民目前为促使老挝走向民族团结、独立统一与和平中立道路而进行的英勇的反美斗争。我们诚意地期望着我国与各个邻国之间，首先是与柬埔寨和老挝之间的友谊得到建立并获得良好的发展。
                          ×　×　×　亲爱的同志们：
    在北方的社会主义革命和统一国家的斗争事业，对于保卫东南亚与世界和平作出贡献的繁重而光荣的任务，正摆在我们党的面前。为了保证革命的胜利，具有决定意义的问题是要更加提高我们全党的战斗力，更加发挥我们党在各方面工作中的领导作用。
    从过去到现在，我们党都努力运用马克思列宁主义来紧密联系越南革命实践。一般来说我们的干部和党员都有优良的革命品质。但是我们还存在许多缺点，比如：主观主义、教条主义、经验主义、官僚主义和个人主义等等。这些缺点阻碍了我们同志的进步。我们必须努力学习马克思列宁主义，加强党内的思想教育，为克服上述这些缺点而斗争。必须更加提高党的阶级性和先锋性质，不断加强党与群众之间的联系，要懂得团结一切爱国和进步的人们，以便胜利地建设社会主义和争取国家的统一。要有创造性的努力去学习各兄弟党的经验。我们必须像列宁所教导的那样谦逊，绝对不得骄傲自满。
    我们党的这次大会，将选举出党的新的中央委员会。我们坚信，在新的中央委员会的领导下，我们全党将更加紧密团结，更加有力地动员全国人民进行斗争，以便实现我们伟大的目标，那就是：
    在北方建设社会主义并为实现和平统一国家而斗争。
                          ×　×　×　
    伟大的马克思列宁主义万岁！
    英雄的越南工人阶级和人民万岁！
    越南劳动党万岁！
    各兄弟党之间的团结一致以及以伟大的苏联为首的社会主义大家庭中的团结一致万岁！
    越南和平、统一、独立、民主和富强万岁！
    世界和平万岁！
