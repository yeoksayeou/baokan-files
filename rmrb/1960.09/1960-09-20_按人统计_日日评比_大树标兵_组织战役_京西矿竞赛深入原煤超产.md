Xinhua News Agency, 19th - The Jingxi Mining Bureau has launched a new high tide of competition starting from the team level, promoting sustained production increases. On the basis of comprehensively overfulfilling the production plan for the first eight months of this year, the bureau has pushed production a big step forward. In the first half of September, the total raw coal output and total footage of tunneling exceeded the plan by 10.73% and 11.58% respectively.

After this bureau proposed a joint competition initiative to brother coal mines across the country, production teams generally formulated competition targets and specific measures, exchanged war letters, and enthusiastically carried out team competitions. Departments such as electromechanical, transportation, and materials have linked up with underground work surfaces, formulated practical measures to ensure good preparatory work and logistics. In the Mentougou, Chengzi, Muchengjian and other coal mines, 90% of workers, cadres, technicians and service personnel have developed individual plans. The Datai Coal Mine, through forms such as "one top multiple competitions", competitions within the same trade, "one-dragon" competitions, and counterpart competitions, has involved teams with different conditions and different levels in the competition upsurge. This mine comprehensively promoted the advanced experience of establishing individual "labor cards" in the Dahui mining area of Muchengjian Mine, recording each worker's various indicators and completion status on the card on a daily basis, evaluating them every day, and promoting overall improvement. After doing so, production records were constantly refreshed. In the first half of September, they completed the national plan with a coal output exceeding 17,983 tons and footage exceeding 399 meters. The bureau immediately convened an on-site meeting in this mine to organize other mines to learn from their experience, making the team competition more extensive and in-depth.

In the competition, each mine set up pace-setters, focused on the backward, so that the advanced level quickly became the universal level. The Wang Degui team of the No. 11 coal mining team in Chengzi Coal Mine was originally relatively poor in production. Section Chief Ding Baofa went deep into this team, mobilized the workers to establish lofty ambitions, learned from the advanced experience of other teams, formulated specific measures, and challenged other teams to compete. As a result, the production of the entire team increased sharply, jumped to the first place in the group, and drove the other three teams to overfulfill their production tasks, making the group an advanced group in the entire mine. The workers of other groups immediately took the No. 11 team as a model and set off a competition upsurge to learn from and catch up with the No. 11 team.

In order to make the competition wave higher and higher and production continue to leap forward, many mines used three, five or seven days as a "battle." Before the "battle," they made full preparations, and after the "battle," they promptly evaluated, summarized experience, and applied advanced experience, and then carried out the next competition "battle" more enthusiastically. In this way, the competition was carried out continuously in a rhythmic manner, and advanced experience was quickly promoted, ensuring continuous leap forward in production. In the process of competing with other teams, the No. 14 tunneling team of Muchengjian Mine had inconsistent operations in the four shifts, and the effect was not significant. Therefore, other teams immediately summarized their own operating experience and helped the No. 14 team with "consultation," so that the four shifts of this team adopted unified advanced operating methods, and the daily footage quickly increased from 1.3 meters to 2.7 meters. In the competition between groups, shifts, and pneumatic drills in the No. 4 tunneling team of Mentougou Mine, after promoting nine advanced experiences such as "multi-drill operation," "slag-throwing blasting," and "parallel drilling and charging operations," the monthly footage level increased from more than 70 meters to more than 100 meters.

    按人统计  日日评比  大树标兵  组织战役
    京西矿竞赛深入原煤超产
    新华社19日讯　京西矿务局以班组为起点掀起竞赛新高潮，推动生产持续上升。全局在全面超额完成了今年前八个月生产计划的基础上，又把生产向前推进了一大步，9月上半月达到的原煤总产量和掘进总进尺，分别比计划超额了10.73％和11.58％。
    这个局向全国兄弟煤矿提出联合竞赛倡议之后，各生产班组普遍订出竞赛指标和具体措施，互递战表，热烈开展班组竞赛。机电、运输、材料等部门纷纷同井下工作面挂钩，制定切实措施，保证做好先行工作和后勤工作。门头沟、城子、木城涧等煤矿，90％的工人、干部、技术人员和服务人员，都制定了个人计划。大台煤矿通过一顶几赛、同工种赛、一条龙赛、对口赛等形式，使不同条件、不同水平的班组都卷入了竞赛热潮。这个矿全面推广了木城涧矿大华采区建立个人“劳动卡片”的先进经验，把每个工人的各项指标和完成情况按日记在卡片上，天天评比，促进全面提高。他们这样做以后，生产纪录不断刷新，9月上半月以煤产量超额一万七千九百八十三吨、进尺超额三百九十九米的成绩完成了国家计划。全局立刻在这个矿召开了现场会议，组织其他各矿学习他们的经验，使班组竞赛开展得更加广泛深入。
    在竞赛中，各矿大树标兵，大抓后进，让先进水平迅速成为普遍水平。城子煤矿回采十一组王德贵班在生产上原来比较差，段长丁宝发就深入这个班，发动工人树立雄心大志，学习其他班组先进经验，订出具体措施，向其他班组挑战竞赛。结果，全班生产猛增，跃居小组第一，并且带动其他三班超额完成生产任务，使小组成为全矿先进组。其他各组工人立刻以十一组为标兵，掀起了学十一组、赶十一组的竞赛热潮。
    为了使竞赛一浪高一浪，生产持续跃进，许多矿以三天、五天或七天作为一个“战役”。“战役”前作好充分准备工作，“战役”后及时评比，总结经验，运用先进经验，然后更热烈地开展下一个竞赛“战役”。这样，既使竞赛有节奏地持续开展，又使先进经验迅速推广，保证生产不断跃进。木城涧矿掘进十四组在同别组竞赛的过程中，四班操作不一致，成效不大；于是，其他班组立即总结自己的操作经验，帮助十四组“会诊”，使这个组四班采取了统一的先进操作法，日进尺迅速由一点三米提高到二点七米。门头沟矿掘进四组在组与组、班与班、风锤与风锤之间的竞赛中，推广了“多锤作业”、“抛渣爆破”、“打眼装药平行作业”等九种先进经验以后，月进尺水平由七十多米提高到一百多米。
