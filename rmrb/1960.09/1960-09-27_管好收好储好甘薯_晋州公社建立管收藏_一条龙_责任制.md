Manage, Harvest, and Store Sweet Potatoes Well
Jinzhou Commune Establishes a "One-Stop" Responsibility System for Management, Collection, and Storage

    (Our Tianjin Dispatch, September 26) The Jinzhou People's Commune Party Committee in Shulu County, Hebei Province, through mobilizing the masses to summarize the experience of sweet potato bumper harvests last year, has established a "one-stop" responsibility system to strengthen the later-stage management, harvesting, and storage of sweet potatoes. They are striving to increase the size and weight of sweet potatoes this year, harvest cleanly, and prevent any loss or spoilage.

    The sweet potatoes planted by Jinzhou Commune this year account for more than 40% of the grain acreage. These sweet potatoes are generally growing well. If later-stage management is strengthened to increase the weight of each sweet potato, and especially to ensure that harvesting and storage are free from losses, the commune's autumn harvest will increase significantly. Therefore, strengthening this work has become the key to ensuring overall increased production at present. The Commune Party Committee recently studied the sweet potato storage situation of the 38 production teams in the commune, and popularized the experience of the Misongzhuang Production Team in managing, harvesting, and storing sweet potatoes. It formulated specific measures to ensure good management, harvesting, and storage of sweet potatoes:

    1. Mobilize commune members to continue to strengthen the later-stage management of sweet potatoes, and prepare for harvesting and storing sweet potatoes. In the later-stage management of sweet potatoes, it is necessary to carry out careful management measures such as topdressing, watering, and hand-lifting vines to promote the early maturity of sweet potatoes, strive to increase the size and weight of sweet potatoes, and harvest more. Some sweet potatoes were planted late this year. To prevent sudden weather changes from freezing the sweet potatoes, it is necessary to promote the methods of earthing up the roots and pouring small amounts of ash into the cracks in the later stage to prevent frost damage. Excessive moisture in sweet potatoes can easily lead to rot, so watering should be stopped a few days before harvesting. When harvesting sweet potatoes, it is necessary to dig and handle them gently, without damaging them with hoes or bumping them. They should be harvested and stored in cellars on the same day, and not left overnight. The principle for handling sweet potatoes is to store the good sweet potatoes in cellars, and slice and dry any with damaged skin.

    2. Establish a division of labor responsibility system combining professional teams and mass assault. In addition to strengthening publicity and education among commune members on cherishing sweet potatoes, the Party branches of each team generally promote the "one-stop" responsibility system for managing, harvesting, and storing sweet potatoes. This year, the commune planted more cotton, and harvesting sweet potatoes and picking cotton will be squeezed together. In order to ensure that harvesting and picking are not delayed, each team will adopt two forms of labor organization: one is to pick the cotton once in advance, and then concentrate a batch of labor (usually the original professional team for managing sweet potatoes) to form a professional team solely for harvesting sweet potatoes; the other is to establish a mixed professional team for harvesting sweet potatoes and picking cotton, concentrating on picking cotton and harvesting sweet potatoes in turn, and mobilizing semi-labor and auxiliary labor to haul, select sweet potatoes, slice, and dry them, to ensure quick harvesting and quick storage in cellars. In order to save time for slicing and drying, in addition to concentrating slicing machines for slicing, commune members are assigned tasks by household and by person to slice with manual tools. Production teams set slicing quotas, and rewards are given for exceeding the quota.

    3. Establish a "one-stop" responsibility system for management, harvesting, and storage. Production teams mobilize commune members to estimate the yield of each sweet potato and set tasks, and implement a system of five guarantees (guaranteeing land, guaranteeing yield, guaranteeing harvesting, guaranteeing storage, and guaranteeing work points) and one reward. Mobilize professional teams to carry out labor competitions with the theme of timely harvesting, quick harvesting, and clean harvesting, and regularly select and reward models.

    At present, on the basis of evaluating and estimating yields, the production teams of this commune have adjusted the professional teams and implemented the "one-stop" method of management, harvesting, and storage. Commune members are carefully managing sweet potatoes, striving to have them mature early and increase in quantity. In order to store sweet potatoes well, each professional team has also newly dug and renovated nearly 600 sweet potato cellars, and selected custodians. All 113 small teams in the commune are equipped with one to two sweet potato slicers per team; more than 6,800 commune member households have prepared one to two sweet potato grating beds.

### 管好收好储好甘薯　晋州公社建立管收藏“一条龙”责任制

　　管好收好储好甘薯
　　晋州公社建立管收藏“一条龙”责任制
    本报天津26日电　河北省束鹿县晋州人民公社党委，通过发动群众总结去年甘薯丰产丰收经验，建立了加强甘薯后期管理、收刨、储存“一条龙”责任制，力争今年甘薯增块增重，收净刨光，不丢不烂。
    晋州公社今年种植的甘薯占粮田面积的40％以上。这些甘薯普遍长的好，如果加强后期管理，作到块块增重，特别是作到收刨、储存不受损失，公社的秋季收成就会增加很多。因此，加强这项工作便成了当前确保全面增产的关键。公社党委最近研究了公社三十八个生产队保管甘薯的情况，并总结推广了秘宋庄生产队甘薯管、收、储的经验，制订了保证甘薯管好、收好和储好的具体措施：
    一、发动社员继续加强甘薯的后期管理，作好收刨储存甘薯准备工作。在甘薯后期管理上，要认真进行追肥、浇水、手提蔓等管理措施，促使甘薯早熟，力争甘薯增块增重多收。今年部分甘薯插秧较晚，为防止天气突变甘薯受冻，要推行后期根部培土、小灰灌缝办法，防止冻坏。甘薯水分过多容易腐烂，应在收刨前几天，停止浇水。收刨甘薯，要作到轻刨轻放，没有镐伤、不碰坏；当天收刨，当天入窖，不隔夜。对甘薯的处理原则是好薯入窖，伤皮的切片晒干。
    二、建立专业队伍和群众突击相结合的分工负责制。各队党支部除对社员加强爱护甘薯的宣传教育外，普遍推行管理、收刨和储存甘薯的“一条龙”责任制。今年这个公社种棉较多，收刨甘薯和摘棉等农活会挤到一起，为了作到收、刨两不误，各队在劳力组织上将采取两种形式：一种是提前摘一遍棉花，然后集中一批劳力（一般是原来管理甘薯的专业队）单独组成收刨甘薯专业队；另一种是建立收薯、摘花混合专业队，集中摘花集中收薯，发动半劳力、辅助劳力拉运、选薯块、切片、晒干，保证作到快收、快入窖。为争取时间突击切片晒干，各队除集中切片机突击切片外，社员按户按人分任务，用手工工具切片，生产队制订切片定额，超额予以奖励。
    三、建立管理、收刨、储存“一条龙”责任制。生产队发动社员对甘薯逐块估产定任务，实行五包（包地块、包产量、包收刨、包储存、包工分）一奖制。发动专业队开展以收的适时，收的快，收的净为内容的劳动竞赛，定期进行评选模范和奖励。
    目前，这个公社各生产队在评定估产的基础上，已调整了专业队伍，按管理、收刨、储存“一条龙”办法，包干落实。社员们正在精心管理甘薯，力争甘薯提前成熟，块块增量。为了把甘薯储好，各专业队还新挖和修整好薯窖近六百个，并选定了保管员。全社一百一十三个小队，每队都备好了一至两架甘薯切片机；六千八百多户社员，每户备妥了甘薯擦片床一至两架。
