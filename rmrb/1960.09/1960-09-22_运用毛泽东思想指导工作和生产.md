　　Applying Mao Zedong Thought to Guide Work and Production
　　Chen Peigui, Young Farmer of Zaotou People’s Commune, Shangrao City, Jiangxi

　　For the past three years, I have consistently studied Chairman Mao's works, repeatedly reading dozens of works such as "On Practice," "On Contradiction," "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People," and "On Protracted War." Mao Zedong Thought has raised my political and ideological consciousness and guided my practical actions, enabling me to overcome various difficulties in my work. I have personally experienced the greatness of Mao Zedong Thought.

　　Why did I strive to study Chairman Mao's works? Initially, it was driven by the situation. In the winter of 1955, during the high tide of agricultural collectivization, I was elected as a production team leader. I was very happy to receive the trust of the masses and worked with great enthusiasm, forgetting sleep and meals. However, because I only knew how to resolutely complete the tasks assigned by the Party and did not know how to better accomplish them, my working methods were rigid, and my attitude was rude. When I encountered people who did not listen or complained, I criticized and struggled against them, which made the masses very dissatisfied. During the rectification campaign, the masses wrote big-character posters criticizing:

　　Chen Peigui's methods are poor,
　　He criticizes and scolds at every door;
　　He can't distinguish right from wrong,
　　How can people be motivated to work long?

　　The big-character posters were pasted on the wall, and it pained my heart. At the time, I thought: I am working so enthusiastically, yet the masses still criticize me. This must be because the masses' thinking is too backward. So, I developed a negative and pessimistic attitude. The Party branch secretary educated me in a timely manner, saying, "If the work is not done well, you can't just blame the masses for being backward. You need to examine your own working methods." He also told me that to do a good job, I must study Chairman Mao's works well. That conversation was extremely enlightening for me.

　　Starting in the spring of 1958, I began to earnestly study Chairman Mao's works. I formulated a specific study plan and adopted a method that combined learning theory with learning culture, progressing from the shallow to the deep. Relying on the Party's kind guidance, the help of the masses, and my own determination, I persisted in studying without interruption, making use of every spare moment, based on the principle of not neglecting both study and production.

　　Studying theory can indeed improve work. I have many experiences in this regard, but I will only talk about the following two things.

　　In the past, I always regarded holding meetings as the only method of leadership. The tighter the tasks, the more meetings I held. Only I spoke at the meetings, and no one else spoke, and they went on until late at night. Therefore, I was never able to complete the tasks very well. After studying "Concern Ourselves with the Well-being of the Masses, and Pay Attention to Methods of Work," and earnestly implementing Chairman Mao's instruction to combine work and rest, I no longer held so many meetings. For example, during breaks in the fields, I would bring up the tasks to be completed tomorrow and let everyone discuss them. At this time, I would speak less and listen more to everyone's free discussions. After listening to everyone's discussions, I would have a better understanding. When it came time to record work points in the evening, I would summarize the issues discussed by everyone, and after raising the issues that needed to be decided, they would be quickly decided. Then, I would urge everyone to rest well. The effect was very effective. Everyone rested well, and the production tasks were completed quickly and well. At that time, the summer harvest and summer planting tasks were completed seven days ahead of schedule.

　　After studying Chairman Mao's works such as "On Practice" and "On Contradiction," I also knew that to do a good job, I had to conduct investigation and research and look at problems comprehensively. So, I analyzed the situation of our poor team and figured out why others said this team was "backward." It turned out that: first, it was because it was poor, and some commune members still owed some debts. Some truly backward people were afraid of associating with them, fearing they would be taken advantage of. Second, because life was relatively difficult and money was tight, coupled with the lack of active help from the leadership to solve their difficulties, they always wanted to go out and find some odd jobs to do, so they wanted to engage in sideline production. As soon as I arrived in this team, I discussed things with them. Slowly, everyone brought up the issues of poverty, liking to engage in sideline production, and selfishness, and they also conducted criticism of each other. Once, when talking about poverty, I told everyone the principles Chairman Mao spoke about in "Introducing a Cooperative," telling them that Chairman Mao said poverty also has its advantages. Poverty leads to change, to work, to revolution, turning bad things into good things. The decisive factor is people. More people mean more discussions, higher enthusiasm, and greater drive. As long as everyone works together and doesn't just focus on individual sideline production, they can turn from poor to rich. When talking about the issue of selfishness, I explained to everyone the principles of Chairman Mao's article "In Memory of Norman Bethune," explaining that when encountering things, don't think of yourself first, but be completely selfless, be a noble person, a moral person, a person beneficial to the people. Then, everyone looked for the reasons for poverty. Everyone believed that the main reason was that the land was not good. I also used the spirit of Chairman Mao's article "On Protracted War" to explain that we should use Chairman Mao's strategic thinking to fight the production battle, that the decisive factor in victory or defeat in war is not weapons but people, and the decisive factor in poverty or wealth is not the quality of the land but people. There are only lazy people in the world, not lazy land. Others see us as backward, but we must see our own strength. When transforming low-yielding fields, I also worked with everyone to use the principles of "On Contradiction" to analyze the properties of various fertilizers and their mutual restraint relationships to achieve rational fertilization. After the early rice harvest, I used the principles of continuous revolution to boost everyone's morale and strive for a bumper late rice harvest. In one year, the poor team was transformed into a rich team, and the yield per mu increased from more than two hundred jin per season to more than nine hundred jin per double season.

　　From this, I deeply realized that studying Chairman Mao's works and applying Mao Zedong Thought to practice can better improve work.

　　运用毛泽东思想指导工作和生产
　　江西上饶市皂头人民公社青年农民　陈培贵
    三年来，我一直坚持学习毛主席的著作，先后反复阅读过《实践论》、《矛盾论》、《关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题》、《论持久战》等几十篇著作。毛泽东思想提高了我的政治思想觉悟，指导了我的实际行动，使我在工作上战胜了各种困难。我亲身体会到毛泽东思想的伟大。
    我为什么发愤学习毛主席的著作呢？开始也是形势所逼。1955年冬正值农业合作化高潮的时候，我被选为生产小队长。我受到群众的信任非常高兴，工作上满腔热情，废寝忘食。但由于我只知道坚决完成党交给的任务，不懂得怎样更好地去完成任务，工作方法生硬，态度粗暴，遇有不听话发牢骚的人，我就对他们批判、斗争，群众对此很不满意。在整风的时候，群众写大字报批评道：
    陈培贵方法差，开口批评闭口骂；是非界线分不清，怎能叫人干劲大。
    大字报贴在墙上，痛在我的心里。当时我想：我这样热心地工作，群众还要批评我，这是群众思想太落后了。于是我就产生了消极悲观情绪。党支部书记及时教育我说：“工作搞不好，不能光怪群众落后，要检查自己的工作方法。”并告诉我要搞好工作，就要好好学毛主席著作。那次谈话，对我有极大启发。
    从1958年春开始，我就认真学习毛主席著作。订出了具体的学习计划，采取由浅入深，学理论与学文化相结合的办法。就这样依靠党的亲切教导，依靠群众帮助和自己的决心，根据学习和生产两不误的原则，见缝插针，坚持学习，从不间断。
    学习了理论，确能作好工作，这方面的体会很多，我只谈以下两件事。
    过去我总把开会当作领导工作的唯一方法，任务越紧，开的会便越多。会上只有我讲的，没有别人讲的，一开就到深夜。所以总是不能很好地完成任务。学习了《关心群众生活，注意工作方法》之后，认真贯彻了毛主席说的要劳逸结合的指示，就不再开这么多的会议了。譬如在田头休息的时候，我就把明天要完成的任务提出来让大家议论，这时我就少说话，多听大家自由地议论，听了大家的议论，我心中便有了底。到了晚上记工分的时候，把大家议论的问题归纳一下，该决定的问题提出来后，很快地便决定下来。然后就督促大家去很好地休息。效果很灵验，大家休息得好，生产任务也完成得又快又好。当时就提前七天完成了夏收夏种任务。
    学习了毛主席的《实践论》、《矛盾论》等著作，我又知道了要想做好工作就要作调查研究，看问题要全面。于是我就分析了我们这个穷队的情况，弄清为什么别人说这个队“落后”，原来：第一是因为它穷，有的社员还欠了一些债，一些思想真正落后的人怕和他们搞到一块，被沾了光；第二是因为生活比较困难，手头紧，加上领导上没有积极帮助他们解决困难，便总想出去找几个活钱来用，于是想搞副业生产。我一到这个小队，就同他们在一起讨论，慢慢地大家把穷、喜欢搞副业、自私自利等情况都摆出来了，还互相开展了批评。有一次谈到穷的时候，我就把毛主席在《介绍一个合作社》中讲的道理讲给大家听，告诉他们毛主席说穷也有好处，穷则思变，要干，要革命，把坏事变成好事；起决定因素的是人，人多议论多，热气高，干劲大，只要大家齐心协力，不要光顾个人搞副业，就可由穷变富。谈到自私自利问题时，就将毛主席《纪念白求恩》这篇文章的道理讲给大家听，说明遇事不要先替自己打算，要毫不自私自利，做一个高尚的人，有道德的人，有益于人民的人。然后大家找穷的原因，大家认为主要是田地不好。我又以毛主席《论持久战》这篇文章的精神，说明要以毛主席的战略思想来打生产仗，决定战争胜负的不在武器而在人，决定穷富的不在田地的好坏，而在人，世界上只有懒人，没有懒田，别人把我们看成落后，自己则要看到自己的力量。在改变低产田的时候，我又和大家一起运用了《矛盾论》的原理分析各种肥料的性能和互相制约的关系，做到合理施肥。早稻丰收后，又以不断革命论的道理，鼓起大家的干劲，争取晚稻大丰收。一年的功夫，就变穷队为富队了，亩产由单季二百多斤提高到双季九百多斤。
    由此我就深深体会到，学习毛主席著作，运用毛泽东思想到实践中去，就能更好地工作。
