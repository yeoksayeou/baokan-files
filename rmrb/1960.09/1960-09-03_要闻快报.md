Jiangxi Launches Field Management Competition

Rural people's communes throughout Jiangxi have launched a vigorous, high-standard, high-quality field management competition. The slogan of the broad masses of commune members is: decide the victory in August and September, fiercely attack the management barrier, and strive for late rice yields to exceed early rice, and autumn grain yields to exceed summer grain.

This year, under the guidance of the policy of taking grain as the key link for comprehensive development, combining diversified harvests with high yield and multiple harvests, Jiangxi Province has made every effort to expand the planting of single-season late rice, double-season late rice, and autumn grain crops such as sweet potatoes. August and September are the key periods for the growth of these crops. In order to strive for more autumn grain, people's communes everywhere have quickly shifted their main leadership force and main labor force to autumn field management.

Fujian Focuses on Management of Remote and Low-Yield Fields

In Fujian, most of the medium and late rice is growing well. However, according to inspections, the seedlings in some remote fields, low-yield fields, and late-transplanted fields are growing poorly and need further processing and fertilization to catch up. In order to seize a balanced increase in autumn production, while focusing on the field management of high-yield fields, all localities have adopted the method of assigning leaders, labor, and measures to vigorously grasp the field management of remote fields, low-yield fields, and late-transplanted fields.

In vigorously grasping the field management of remote fields, low-yield fields, and late-transplanted fields, all localities have universally adopted various effective measures in accordance with local conditions, turning the unfavorable conditions of remote fields and low-yield fields into favorable conditions. According to the situation of many weeds on the edges of remote fields, the communes in Pingnan County cut and composted green manure on the spot and applied it on the spot. Each mu of field not only applied more green manure, but also saved labor for accumulating and transporting fertilizer.

Guangxi Manufactures Large Quantities of Irrigation and Drainage Equipment to Support Drought Resistance

Since the summer, varying degrees of drought have occurred in Guangxi. The staff and workers of the Guangxi agricultural machinery industry system have manufactured a large number of irrigation and drainage equipment to support drought resistance. As of August 15th, they have overfulfilled the year's manufacturing tasks for cast iron water pipes, gate valves, screws, and rubber hose connectors and clips; other power machinery such as water pumps are close to completing the year's production tasks.

Sichuan Vigorously Grasps This Year's Rapeseed Sowing Work

According to the guiding ideology of "the earlier, the better, one step proactively, every step proactively", Sichuan has made full use of the high-yield experience of timely early sowing of rapeseed, started early, and vigorously grasped the rapeseed sowing work. In order to grow rapeseed well, Sichuan launched the masses from top to bottom and from bottom to top to summarize the experience of increasing rapeseed production as early as the beginning of this year's rapeseed harvesting.

Under the slogan of "eliminating the three types of seedlings before sowing," all localities in Sichuan paid great attention to the quality of rapeseed sowing. After rapeseed sowing, all localities immediately organized commune members with seedling raising experience to form professional teams and adopted the method of dividing areas and assigning responsibilities for meticulous management. Now, some of the earlier sown rapeseed is lush green and growing vigorously.

Qinghai Grasps Management of Potato Tuber Formation Stage

People's communes in Qinghai Province seized the tuber formation period of potatoes, strengthened weeding, earthing up, topdressing, and prevention and control of late blight, and launched a movement to strive for potato overproduction. This year, due to the large-scale reclamation of wasteland and full utilization of scattered land, the potato planting area in Qinghai Province has greatly increased. Because members of all ethnic groups immediately grasped field management after sowing and used high-yield plots to drive general fields, potatoes generally grow well.

In order to make the tubers grow more and larger, all localities have made proper arrangements for labor, ensuring that sufficient labor is invested in the late-stage field management of potatoes. Communes and farms have universally promoted the production responsibility system of assigning leaders, assigning plots, assigning tasks, assigning time, and assigning work points to carefully manage potatoes.

    要闻快报
    江西掀起田间管理竞赛
    江西各地农村人民公社掀起了轰轰烈烈的高标准、高质量田间管理竞赛运动。广大社员的口号是：决战8、9月，猛攻管理关，力争晚稻产量超早稻，秋粮产量超夏粮。
    今年江西省在以粮为纲全面发展以及多种多收和高产多收相结合的方针指导下，尽力扩种了一季晚稻、二季晚稻和红薯等秋收杂粮作物。8、9两月，是这些作物生长的关键时期，为了力争多收秋粮，各地人民公社都把主要领导力量、主要劳力迅速转向秋田管理。
    福建大抓边远田低产田管理
    福建各地大部分中、晚稻生长良好。但据检查，有些边远田、低产田和迟插田的禾苗长得较差，需要进一步加工加肥才能迎头赶上。为了夺取秋季平衡增产，各地在大抓丰产田田间管理的同时，都采取定领导、定劳力、定措施的办法，狠抓边远田、低产田和迟插田的田间管理。
    各地在大抓边远田、低产田和迟插田的田间管理中，普遍因地制宜地采取各种有效措施，变边远田、低产田的不利条件为有利条件。屏南县各公社根据边远田田边草多的情况，就地大砍大沤青肥，就地施用，每亩田不但因此多施了青草肥，同时还节省了积肥运肥的劳力。
    广西制造大批排灌设备支援抗旱
    广西入夏以来，先后实现不同程度的旱象，广西农业机械工业系统职工为支援抗旱制造出大批排灌设备。到8月15日止，他们已经超额完成全年的铸铁水管、闸阀、螺丝和胶管接头连夹子等产品的制造任务；其他如水泵等动力机械已经接近完成全年生产任务。
    四川狠抓今年油菜播种工作
    四川各地根据“一早百早，一步主动，步步主动”的指导思想，充分运用油菜适时早播的高产经验，及早动手，狠抓油菜播种工作。为了种好油菜，四川各地早在今年油菜收割一开始，就发动群众从上而下，从下而上地总结油菜增产经验。
    四川各地在“把三类苗消灭在播种之前”的口号下，都很注意油菜播种质量。各地在油菜播种以后，都立即组织有育苗经验的社员，组成专业队，采取划片包干办法，精细管理。现在，部分播种较早的油菜，已一片葱绿，茁壮可爱。
    青海抓紧马铃薯结薯阶段管理
    青海省各地人民公社抓紧马铃薯的结薯期，加强除草、壅土、追肥和防治晚疫病等工作，掀起了力争马铃薯超产运动。今年青海省由于大量开垦荒地和充分利用了零星地，马铃薯种植面积更有了很大增加。由于各族社员在播种以后，立即抓住了田间管理，用丰产方带动一般田，因此马铃薯普遍生长良好。
    为了使薯块结得多，结得大，各地都对劳动力作了妥善的安排，保证有足够的劳动力投入马铃薯的后期田间管理。各公社、农场普遍推行了定领导、定地块、定任务、定时间、定工分的生产责任制来精管马铃薯。
