Zong Jingshang Riveting Group Achieves Comprehensive Improvement in Production, Politics, and Technology

(Our report) The Zong Jingshang riveting group of the Dalian Shipyard, with the Party group as the core, fully utilized the organizational roles of the four group leaders from the Party, administration, labor union, and Communist Youth League, and the backbone roles of the "eight great staff members" in planning and scheduling, economic accounting, etc., united all twenty-three workers in the group, and comprehensively grasped ideology, production, management, life, and learning. This made their group not only a production organization of socialist material wealth but also an organization for communist education and arranging workers' lives, ensuring that for the past two years, output has exceeded quotas every month, quality has steadily improved, and savings and safety have been consistently excellent, with everyone making great progress politically and technically.

The most important experience of the Zong Jingshang group is to closely focus on production, life, and the central tasks of each period, and to do ideological work quickly, accurately, and effectively. Usually, the group leaders of the Party, administration, labor union, and Communist Youth League all do ideological work, using methods such as collective brainstorming, individual assistance, and positive education at any time and place to help workers in the group improve their ideological understanding, so that everyone works with one heart and one mind.

In the management work of the group, they established a management system with the Party group as the core, fully utilizing the roles of the Party, administrative, labor union, and Communist Youth League group leaders, as well as the "eight great staff members" such as the planning and scheduling staff, economic accounting staff, quota management staff, safety officer, and propagandist. For example, in order to allow the workers serving as the "eight great staff members" to better cooperate, the group established a "three pre-planning meeting" system: Before work in the morning, the "eight great staff members" plan the day's work, with the group leader explaining the day's tasks and highlighting the things that need attention; before work after the lunch break, a planning meeting is held, mainly to report on the morning's work and raise problems that need to be solved; the evening planning meeting mainly explains the preparation for the next day's work. In addition, each "staff member" has their own work arrangement. For example, before going to work in the morning, the safety officer explains the safety matters that need attention for each key project; after work, the economic accounting staff is busy calculating the new achievements created by each work team, and the propagandist compiles these new people and new things into jingles and praises them on the blackboard newspaper—the group is full of vitality everywhere.

The Zong Jingshang group grasps production very meticulously and comprehensively: First, they proactively prepare for production. Each month when they receive a task, the administrative group leader proactively reports to the Party group leader and jointly study the specific arrangements, determine the monthly goals and direction, as well as the weekly, daily, and shift work plans, so that these plans are effectively implemented to each worker. On the basis of full worker awareness, they are fully realized. In order to keep production constantly in a proactive state, they conduct three major preparations each month: early in the month for the middle of the month, in the middle of the month for the end of the month, and at the end of the month for the next month, in a repeated cycle.

Second, they pay attention to production progress. For example, in June, the whole group undertook the production task on a 1,200-horsepower ship. According to the task requirements, there was a shortage of twenty people. The Party group promptly studied countermeasures and found that Wang Yonghao, one master and one apprentice, were working very quickly, completing sixteen items a day, while Wang Yunjie, Li Baojin, Liu Zhouhong and three other assistant teams of six people were still somewhat passive. Therefore, they went to the ship to hold an on-site meeting, inviting Wang Yonghao to introduce advanced methods to everyone. Wang Yunjie, Li Baojin, Liu Zhouhong, etc. learned the techniques on the spot, with immediate results, completing in one and a half days tasks that previously took four days to complete. Six people were equivalent to sixteen people, breaking through the key to the labor shortage and catching up with the overall progress.

Third, they proactively improve the group's quality inspection system. This group formulated a quality management system of "four accurate, three checks, two guarantees, and one attainment." The "four accurate" are: accurate drawings, accurate measurements, accurate curvature and shape, and accurate assembly. The "three checks" are: checking before construction whether the tools, materials, and technology are complete; checking in the middle of construction the serious implementation of the process regulations; and conducting a thorough inspection again before handing over the work, to ensure one-time acceptance.

Fourth, they proactively conduct safety equipment inspections.

Fifth, they persist in carrying out mass technological revolution movements. Energetically carrying out technological innovation and technological revolution is the main way for this group to achieve high quality and high output. Focusing on the key to production, the workers in this group have realized six major technological innovation projects in the first half of this year, such as the automatic line for manhole rings and the linkage line for booms, which has powerfully promoted the leap forward in production.

Sixth, they vigorously engage in product design revolution. High quality, high output, and economy are the consistent production principles of this group. In order to achieve increased production without increasing materials, all the workers in the group took Cui Deyun, who loved the factory as his home, as an example, and everyone established the idea of valuing materials as gold and not wasting an inch of material. In addition to adhering to daily saving and recycling, they also vigorously engaged in product design revolution. Since the beginning of this year, through technological revolution and product design revolution, they have saved a total of 245 tons of new and old steel and 350 kilograms of welding rods.

This group, while grasping ideology and production, also pays attention to grasping life. The workers in the group often make family visits to each other and help each other in life. Once, the roof of the old worker Dou Changhai's house was leaking. After the Party group leader learned about it, he and other group members helped him repair the house during Sunday rest. This incident moved Dou Changhai very much, and his production enthusiasm became even greater afterwards.

Under the leadership of the Party group, this group has grasped political theory study very tightly. They organized a theoretical study group and persisted in studying Chairman Mao's works. After studying works such as "On Contradiction" and "On Practice," they could recognize the dialectical and unified relationship between more, faster, better, and more economical, labor and rest, soaring enthusiasm and scientific analysis, advanced and backward, etc. They recognized that backward people also have advantages and can be transformed into advanced through education, so they consciously carried out activities to help the advanced help the backward. This group also organized workers to participate in cultural studies and adopted methods such as teachers teaching apprentices, those with low technical skills learning from those with high technical skills, and formulating learning contracts to improve the technical level of apprentices and young workers. Now, the apprentices in the group can do level two or three work, and young workers generally reach level four or above.

    抓思想  抓生产  抓管理  抓生活  抓学习
    宗景尚铆工小组生产、政治、技术全面提高
    本报讯　大连造船厂宗景尚铆工小组，以党小组为核心，充分发挥党政工团四个小组长的组织作用，和计划调度、经济核算等“八大员”的骨干作用，团结全组二十三名工人，全面抓思想、抓生产、抓管理、抓生活、抓学习，使自己小组不仅是社会主义物质财富的生产组织，同时又成为共产主义教育和安排工人生活的组织，保证了两年来产量月月超额，质量步步提高，节约和安全满堂红，每个人政治上、技术上都有很大进步。
    宗景尚小组最重要的经验，是紧紧围绕生产、生活和每个时期的中心任务，又紧、又准、又快地做好思想工作。平时，党、行政、工会、共青团的小组长都做思想工作，随时随地运用集体务虚、个别帮助、正面教育等方法，帮助组内工人提高思想认识，使大家工作起来一条心一股劲。
    在小组的管理工作中，他们建立了一套以党小组为核心、充分发挥党、行政、工会、共青团小组长和计划调度员、经济核算员、定额管理员、安全员、宣传员等“八大员”作用的管理制度。例如，为了让工人兼职的“八大员”更好地配合协作，组内建立了“三前参谋会”的制度：早晨开工前，“八大员”参谋一天的工作，由组长交代当天的任务，提出应注意的事项；午休开工前，召开参谋会，主要是汇报上午工作，提出需要解决的问题；晚上的参谋会则主要是说明第二天的工作准备情况。另外，每个“员”都有自己的工作安排，例如早晨上班以前，安全员说明各重点工程需要注意的安全事项；下班后，经济核算员就忙着计算各个帮架所创造的新成绩，宣传员就把这些新人新事编成顺口溜在黑板报上表扬——小组里到处都显得生气勃勃。
    宗景尚小组抓生产十分细致、全面：第一、主动做好生产准备。每月接到任务时，行政组长便主动向党组长汇报，并共同研究具体安排，确定全月的目标方向，以及每周、每天、每班的作业计划，使这些计划，切实落实到每个工人。在工人充分自觉的基础上，全面实现。为了使生产经常处于主动状态，他们每月进行三次大备战，上旬备中旬，中旬备下旬，下旬备下月，反复循环。
    第二、注意生产进度。如6月份全组担负了一千二百马力船上的生产任务，按任务要求缺二十人。党小组及时研究对策，发现王永好一师一徒干得很快，一天总要完成十六项，而王允杰、李宝金、刘洲洪三副帮架六个人还有些被动；于是就上船召开现场会，请王永好向大家介绍先进方法。王允杰、李宝金、刘洲洪等当场学艺，立竿见影，一天半完成了过去需要四天才能完成的任务，六个人顶了十六个人，突破了劳动力不足的关键，赶上了总进度。
    第三、主动健全小组质量检查制度。这个小组制定了“四准、三查、二保、一达到”的质量管理制度。四准，图画的准，尺寸量的准，曲度样形准，组组安装准。“三查”是施工前查工具、材料、工艺是否健全；中间查工艺规程认真贯彻的情况；施工交活前再做彻底检查，保证达到一次交活。
    第四、主动进行安全设备检查。
    第五、坚持开展群众性的技术革命运动。大闹技术革新和技术革命是这个小组实现优质高产的主要途径，这个小组工人，针对生产关键，今年上半年实现了人孔圈自动线、吊杆连动线等六个重大的技术革新项目，有力地推动了生产跃进。
    第六、大搞产品设计革命。优质高产又节约是这个小组一贯坚持的生产原则。为了实现增产不增料，全组工人以爱厂如家的崔德云为榜样，人人树立了视料如金、寸材不废的思想。他们除坚持日常节约回收外，还大闹产品设计革命，今年以来通过技术革命、产品设计革命，共节约新旧钢材二百四十五吨、电焊条三百五十公斤。
    这个小组在抓思想、抓生产的同时，还注意抓生活。小组工人经常互相作家庭访问，在生活上互相帮助。有一次，老工人窦长海家里的屋顶有些漏雨，党小组长知道后，便和其他组员一道，利用星期日休息的时候，帮助他把房子修好。这件事使窦长海十分感动，以后他的生产劲头更大了。
    在党小组的领导下，这个小组对政治理论学习抓得很紧。他们组织了一个理论学习小组，坚持学习毛主席的著作。在学习了“矛盾论”“实践论”等著作后，对多快与好省，劳与逸，冲天干劲和科学分析，先进和后进等问题，都能认识到它们之间的辩证和统一关系，认识到落后的人也有优点，经过教育也可以转化为先进，于是自觉地开展了先进帮后进的活动。这个小组还组织工人参加文化学习，并采取老师包教徒工，技术低的向技术高的学习、制订学习合同等方法，提高徒工、青工的技术水平。现在组里的徒工都能干二三级的活，青年工人普遍达到四级以上水平。
