　　The Japan-China Trade Promotion Association issued a statement on the 6th, stating that it would concentrate its efforts to enable the government to conclude a trade agreement with China. The organization also passed a resolution at an emergency meeting of the board of directors held on August 30, saying that Premier Zhou Enlai's speech reflected China's friendly attitude towards the Japanese people. The resolution expressed gratitude for China's friendship towards the Japanese people.

　　The resolution pointed out that the Japanese government should neither adopt a hostile attitude towards China nor participate in the conspiracy to create "two Chinas."

　　The resolution said that it is very necessary for the two governments to sign a trade agreement. To this end, "we urge the Ikeda Cabinet to make efforts to establish normal diplomatic relations with China."

　　The Japan Association for the Promotion of International Trade decided on September 1 to send a letter to the Japanese government, requesting the government to make special efforts to restore diplomatic relations with China. The association requested the Ikeda government not to take any actions hostile to China, but to take all possible measures to promote friendly relations with China.

　　The association pointed out: "The best way to ensure the normal development of trade with China is for the governments to conclude an agreement." The association urged the Ikeda government to make active efforts to conclude such an agreement. The association also requested the government to take measures to enable trade between Japanese private companies and Chinese companies to proceed smoothly.

　　The National Council for the Restoration of Japan-China Diplomatic Relations held a board meeting on the 1st, unanimously believing that Premier Zhou Enlai's speech heralded a bright future for Japan-China relations. The participants unanimously pointed out that the conditions for resuming trade can only mature when the Japanese people force the government to agree to the three principles concerning Japan-China relations.

　　The Japan Socialist Party decided on September 2 to launch a movement demanding that the government conclude a trade agreement with the Chinese government based on Premier Zhou Enlai's proposal. Seiichi Katsumada, director of the Education and Propaganda Bureau of the Socialist Party, said that the Socialist Party will strive to force the Ikeda Cabinet to change its China policy and restore normal diplomatic relations between Japan and China.

　　The General Council of Trade Unions of Japan sent a delegation to meet with Japanese Prime Minister Ikeda on August 31, demanding the restoration of Japan-China diplomatic relations, the abolition of the new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty," and the removal of U.S. troops and military bases in Japan.

　　The Diet Members' League for the Promotion of Japan-China Trade has also decided to launch a campaign to restore Japan-China trade and will call on the leaders of various factions within the ruling party to participate.

　　According to Kyodo News, Japanese business people "generally welcome Zhou Enlai's speech" and "generally expect the early restoration of trade between Japan and China." They also said that it is necessary to create conditions for the conclusion of a trade agreement between the governments.

　　Major Japanese newspapers have widely published Premier Zhou's speech in prominent positions and demanded that the Ikeda government abandon its "wait and see" attitude, improve Japan-China relations, and restore Japan-China trade in accordance with the three principles put forward by Premier Zhou.

　　The "Mainichi Shimbun" said: "Now is the time for the government and the Liberal Democratic Party to take a forward-looking attitude and abandon the wait-and-see policy of the Kishi government, and to take a forward-looking attitude to break the deadlock in Japan-China relations."

　　The "Nihon Keizai Shimbun" said that Premier Zhou's speech "is an extremely welcome development."
