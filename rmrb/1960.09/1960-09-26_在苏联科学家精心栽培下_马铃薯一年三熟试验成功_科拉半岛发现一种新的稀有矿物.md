Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, September 25th. According to Soviet magazine reports, Soviet scientists have successfully experimented with planting three crops of potatoes a year in areas around 55 degrees north latitude. The average annual yield of the experimental fields reached 960 quintals per hectare (equivalent to 12,800 jin per mu).

This experiment was started six years ago by the Soviet Potato Cultivation Science Research Institute under the leadership of Professor Lorch. Every summer, three crops of potatoes were harvested on the institute's experimental land near Moscow.

The characteristic of their method is to accurately calculate the planting time and the amount of fertilizer applied, in order to maximize the utilization of the relatively short summer available for potato growth near Moscow.

The first planting takes place from April 20th to 25th. The row spacing and plant spacing are both sixty centimeters. Twelve days before the first crop is harvested, the second crop is planted between the ridges. After the first crop is harvested, the dug soil is used to hill the stems of the second crop. Shortly before the second crop is harvested, the third crop is planted in the old holes of the first crop. In this way, the first crop can be harvested in the first half of July, the second crop in August, and the third crop at the end of September or the beginning of October.

They used high-yield, early-maturing varieties, and only planted whole tubers that had undergone pre-sprouting treatment. This can shorten the potato growing season by at least a week. The land is deeply plowed. In addition, according to the soil conditions, appropriate amounts of manure and chemical fertilizers determined through scientific analysis are applied, and water is applied several times depending on the weather conditions.

Xinhua News Agency, September 24th. According to TASS, the Soviet Union recently discovered a new rare mineral, vlasovite. To date, the Soviet Union has discovered twenty-six rare minerals in the past five years, making it the country with the most rare mineral discoveries in the world. Vlasovite was discovered by Soviet geologist Tikhonenkova on the Kola Peninsula. This newly discovered rare mineral is named vlasovite in memory of the famous Soviet scientist Vlasov. It contains more than 30% zirconium. Its natural shape is like transparent quartz grains, up to three centimeters in diameter.

Soviet scientists have also determined that niobium ore is usually found near this mineral, which is also a very valuable raw material in industry.

### 在苏联科学家精心栽培下　马铃薯一年三熟试验成功  科拉半岛发现一种新的稀有矿物

    在苏联科学家精心栽培下
　　马铃薯一年三熟试验成功
　  科拉半岛发现一种新的稀有矿物
    新华社莫斯科25日电　据苏联杂志报道，苏联科学家试验在北纬五十五度左右地区一年种植三茬马铃薯获得成功，试验田全年平均产量达每公顷九百六十公担（合每市亩一万二千八百市斤）。
    这一试验是由苏联马铃薯栽培科学研究所六年前在洛尔赫教授领导下开始进行的，在研究所的莫斯科近郊试验地上每一个夏季都收获了三茬马铃薯。
    他们采用的方法特点是精确计算栽种时间和施肥数量，以便最大限度利用莫斯科近郊可供马铃薯生长的比较短的夏季。
    第一次栽种在4月20日到25日。栽种行距和株距都是六十厘米。在第一茬收获前十二天在垅间栽上第二茬。在第一茬收获后，掘过的土正好用来为第二茬的茎培土。在第二茬收获前不久，利用第一茬的旧穴栽上第三茬。这样在7月上半月就可收获第一茬，8月收二茬，9月底或10月初收三茬。
    他们采用了高产量早熟品种，并且只栽种经过事先春化处理的整块的块茎。这样就可以使马铃薯营养期至少缩短一星期。土地经过深翻。此外还根据土质情况施用经过科学分析确定的适量的厩肥和化肥，根据天气情况浇若干次水。
    新华社24日讯　据塔斯社报道：苏联最近发现了一种新的稀有矿物弗拉索维特。至此，苏联在最近五年内已经发现了二十六种稀有矿物，是世界上发现稀有矿物最多的国家。弗拉索维特是苏联地质学家吉洪年科娃在科拉半岛发现的。这种新发现的稀有矿物是为了纪念苏联著名科学家弗拉索夫而命名为弗拉索维特的。它含有30％以上的锆。它的自然形状像一颗颗透明的石英谷粒，直径达三厘米。
    苏联科学家还确定，这种矿物附近，通常都有铌矿，这也是一种工业上很珍贵的原料。
