Coal Washing is an Important Link in Increasing Steel Production

In the booming movement to increase production and practice thrift, the primary task of the industrial production front is to concentrate efforts to ensure the increase in steel production. What is the key link to increasing steel production at present? One of the key links is coal washing. Firmly grasping and doing a good job in the coal washing process has a very important role in ensuring a substantial increase in steel production on the existing basis, and in achieving high-yield and high-quality steel.

The production of steel, iron, coke, and coal are interlocked and mutually promoting and restricting, both in quantity and quality. In particular, the quality of steel, iron, coke, and coal are closely inseparable. The quality of pig iron, the level of sulfur content, directly affects the high or low yield, and the quality of steel; the quality of coke, the ash and sulfur content, directly affects the high or low yield, and the quality of pig iron. The quality of coal is a prerequisite for the high or low yield, and the quality of coke. The principle is very clear: the volume and capacity of open-hearth furnaces, blast furnaces, and coke ovens are fixed. If the quality of raw materials put into the furnace is not high and contains many impurities, the finished products will definitely be reduced. Taking ironmaking as an example, if the ash or sulfur content of coke increases by 1%, the productivity of the ironmaking blast furnace will decrease by 2% to 2.5%. At the same time, high sulfur content in coke leads to high sulfur content in the pig iron produced, which shortens the lifespan of the smelting furnace and affects steel production. From the perspective of quality, the main indicator of pig iron quality is the level of sulfur content; high sulfur content means low quality. And eight or nine out of ten times, the sulfur content of pig iron comes from coke. Similarly, using high-sulfur pig iron to make steel will not only reduce the yield but also make the steel difficult to roll into finished products. It can be seen that improving the quality of coke is an extremely important link in improving the production and quality of pig iron, and ensuring high-quality and high-yield steel.

What is the key link to improving the quality of coke? The key is coal washing. Existing experience has proven that generally, using washed fine coal for coking results in 10% to 20% lower ash content compared to using raw coal directly. Through washing, about 60% of the sulfur content in coal can be removed. Therefore, coal washing is an important link in ensuring high-quality and high-yield steel. However, the importance of firmly grasping coal washing goes beyond this. From the perspective of the current situation of China's steelmaking industry, more than half of the pig iron used in the national steelmaking industry is produced by small blast furnaces. And a large portion of the coke used in small blast furnaces is produced by indigenous methods. Therefore, it is even more necessary to firmly grasp and do a good job in coal washing. Numerous small enterprises have proven that it is entirely possible to universally produce good coke with low ash content, low sulfur content, and high mechanical strength using indigenous methods. If the quality of coke can be guaranteed, the quality of pig iron produced by small blast furnaces will also be guaranteed. As long as the sulfur content of pig iron produced by small blast furnaces nationwide is reduced by 0.1% compared to the national standard, the national steel production will increase by a considerable amount.

So, can we ensure that all coal used for coking is washed? It is entirely possible. In terms of coal washing production capacity, since last year, the coal industry system has built hundreds of "small and foreign" simple coal washing plants, and several modern large-scale coal washing plants have also been built, which has greatly increased this year's coal washing production capacity compared to last year. As long as we actively take measures to fully utilize the capacity of these coal washing plants, we can largely solve the problem of coal washing for coking. However, what about places that do not yet have coal washing plants or cannot obtain fine coal supply? In these places, as long as we mobilize the masses, vigorously carry out technical innovation, do it ourselves, adapt to local conditions, and build simple coal washing equipment using indigenous or combined indigenous and foreign methods, it can also be done. For example, the coking plants in Tang County, Hebei, Xuecheng, Shandong, Wuxi, Jiangsu, and many other regions across the country have created many coal washing experiences adapting to local conditions and using simple equipment. Also, the experience of the Coking Branch of the Xuchang Iron and Steel Plant in Henan, published in this newspaper today, vividly demonstrates that both large and small coking enterprises can build their own coal washing equipment, use washed fine coal for coking, and greatly improve the production and quality of coke. The Coking Branch of the Xuchang Iron and Steel Plant vigorously carried out a coal washing technological revolution and created a jigging coal washing machine. After continuous practice and improvement, this coal washing machine has now developed into a combined coal washing machine that integrates washing, sorting, and crushing. As a result, the plant's coke production and quality have been continuously improving, and it was named a national red banner unit for coking last year. In the first half of this year, they not only overfulfilled the state plan, but also the ash and sulfur content of coke were lower than the national standards, the mechanical strength of coke reached over 300 kilograms, and the coking rate reached 75%. This fact fully demonstrates that as long as the leadership pays attention, deeply mobilizes the masses, and vigorously carries out coal washing technological innovation and revolution, the coal washing equipment can be solved, and the coal washing technology can be mastered.

However, having coal washing equipment and mastering coal washing technology only provides the objective possibility of washing and sorting all coal used for coking. More importantly, we must truly recognize and value the importance of coal washing for increasing steel production ideologically. If we value it ideologically, we must also take a series of specific measures to substantially increase the amount of coal washing. An important issue at present is to fully utilize the capacity of existing coal washing equipment. To achieve this, the production, distribution, and transportation of coal must all take concrete measures to ensure that each coal washing plant is supplied with sufficient raw coal. All mines producing coking coal must strive to increase the production of raw coal and first meet the needs of coal washing plants. In terms of transportation, the transportation of raw coal and products supplied to coal washing plants should be given an important position, prioritized, quickly transported, and ensured in quality and quantity. All small ironmaking enterprises must create conditions to adhere to coal washing under any circumstances, and insist on not using unwashed coal for coking.

The entire steel production itself is a process of great collaboration, and each link is closely connected and interlocked. If the previous link does not prepare conditions for the next link, the next link will encounter difficulties in achieving high-quality and high-yield. Coal washing may seem like it is not a major link in the entire steel production process, but it is indeed an indispensable link in the steel production chain. When you ignore it, the entire production chain will be affected, and it will inevitably rise to become a key link, influencing the entire production. Therefore, attaching importance to coal washing is essentially attaching importance to the objective laws of production and treating coal washing in a correct position. We must ensure that: the greater the production task, the more coal is used, the more we must adhere to coal washing.

Over the past two years, we have accumulated many experiences in coal washing and coking, and created many good methods for solving coal washing equipment and coal washing technology by combining indigenous and foreign methods. As long as we seriously and practically grasp the coal washing link, we will definitely be able to ensure that all coal used for coking is washed and sorted, and we will definitely be able to bring a new leap in the quality and production of coke, thereby promoting and ensuring a substantial increase in steel production.

### 洗煤是增产钢铁的重要环节

    洗煤是增产钢铁的重要环节
    在轰轰烈烈的增产节约运动中，工业生产战线的首要任务是集中力量，保证钢的增产。当前增产钢的关键环节是什么呢？关键环节之一，就是洗煤。狠狠地抓紧和抓好煤炭洗选这个环节，对保证钢铁生产在现有基础上大幅度增长，并且做到高产优质，有着极为重大的作用。
    钢、铁、焦、煤的生产，无论在数量和质量上都是环环相扣、相互促进和相互制约的。特别是钢、铁、焦、煤的质量，更是密切不可分的。生铁质量的好坏，含硫量的高低，直接影响到钢的高产或低产，优质或劣质；焦炭质量的好坏，灰分和硫分的高低，又直接影响到生铁的高产或低产，优质或劣质。而煤的质量好坏，又是焦炭高产或低产，优质或劣质的前提。道理很清楚，无论是平炉、高炉和炼焦炉的体积和容积都是固定的，如果投入炉内的原料质量不高，含有很多的杂质，冶炼出的成品就一定会减少。以炼铁为例，如果焦炭的灰分或硫分每增加1％，那么，炼铁高炉的生产率就要降低2％至2.5％。同时，焦炭的含硫高，炼出来的生铁含硫量也高，化铁炉的炉龄就会缩短，就会影响钢的产量。再从质量来看，生铁质量好坏的主要标志就是含硫量的高低，含硫量高，质量就低。而生铁的含硫量十之八、九都来源于焦炭。同样，用含硫量高的生铁炼钢，不仅产量要降低，炼出的钢还不易轧制成材。这就可见提高焦炭质量，是提高生铁的产量和质量，确保钢的优质高产极为重要的一个环节。
    提高焦炭质量的关键环节又是什么呢？关键就是洗煤。根据已有的经验证明：凡是用经过洗选的精煤炼焦，一般说来，煤炭中的灰分要比直接用原煤炼焦低10％至20％，通过洗选，煤炭中的硫分可以除去60％左右，所以说，煤炭的洗选是保证钢铁优质高产的重要环节。但是，狠抓煤炭洗选的重要性还不止于此。从我国炼钢工业的现实情况来看，全国炼钢工业所用的生铁，有半数以上都是小高炉炼的。而小高炉炼铁所用的焦炭有很大一部分是用土法生产的焦炭。因此，就更加需要抓紧和抓好煤炭的洗选。许许多多的小型企业证明，完全可以普遍做到用土法炼出灰分少、硫分低、机械强度高的好焦炭来。焦炭的质量能得到保证，小高炉炼出的生铁的质量也就有了保证。只要全国小高炉炼出的生铁含硫量比国家规定指标降低零点一，全国钢的产量就会增加相当大的一个数字。
    那么，我们能不能做到凡是炼焦的煤都经过洗选呢？是完全可以做到的。从洗煤生产能力来看，去年以来，煤炭工业系统建成了“小洋群”简易洗煤厂数百座，另外还建成了几座现代化的大型洗煤厂，这就使今年的洗煤生产能力比去年大大增加了。只要我们积极采取措施，充分发挥这些洗煤厂的能力，就能在很大程度上解决洗煤炼焦的问题。可是，在一些还没有洗煤厂或不能得到精煤供应的地方怎么办呢？在这些地方，只要发动群众，大搞技术革新，自己动手，因地制宜，因陋就简地大造土法或土洋结合的洗煤设备，也是可以办到的。例如河北唐县、山东薛城、江苏无锡以及全国其它许多地区炼焦厂，因地制宜，因陋就简地创造的许多洗煤经验，以及本报今天发表的河南许昌钢铁厂焦化分厂的经验，都生动地证明了无论是大小炼焦企业，都可以自己动手搞洗煤设备，做到用洗选以后的精煤炼焦，都可以大大提高焦炭的产量和质量。许昌钢铁厂焦化分厂大搞洗煤技术革命，创造了一台跳汰式洗煤机，经过不断的实践和改进，现在，这台洗煤机又发展成为洗煤、选煤、粉碎三合一的联合洗煤机。结果这个厂的焦炭产量和质量一直不断提高，去年被评为全国炼焦红旗单位。今年上半年，他们不仅超额完成了国家计划，而且焦炭灰分和硫分都比国家规定的指标低，焦炭机械强度达到三百公斤以上，结焦率达到75％。这个事实，充分说明了只要领导重视，深入发动群众，大搞洗煤技术革新和技术革命，洗煤的设备是能够解决的，洗煤的技术也是能够掌握的。
    但是，有了洗煤设备，掌握了洗煤技术，所提供的还只是做到凡是炼焦的煤炭都洗、都选的客观可能性。更重要的还是要从思想上真正认识和重视煤炭必须洗选对于增产钢铁的重要性。思想重视了，还须采取一系列具体措施，才能大幅度增加洗煤的数量。当前的一个重要问题，是充分发挥现有的洗煤设备的能力。为了做到这一点，就要求煤炭的生产、分配、运输等各个环节必须切切实实采取具体措施，保证供给各洗煤厂以充足的原煤。一切生产炼焦煤的矿井，要努力增产原煤，并且首先满足洗煤厂的需要。运输方面，应当把供给洗煤厂的原煤和产品运输放在重要地位，先运、快运、保质保量。一切小型炼铁企业都要创造条件做到不论在任何情况下，都坚持洗煤，都坚持不用没有经过洗选的煤炭炼焦。
    整个钢铁生产本身是一个大协作的过程，每一个环节都是紧密衔接，环环相扣的。前一个环节如果不为后一个环节准备好条件，后一个环节实现优质高产就要遇到困难。洗煤，看来似乎在整个钢铁生产过程中并非主要环节，但是它的的确确又是钢铁生产链条中不可缺少的一环，当你忽视了它的时候，整个生产链条就要受到影响，它就必然上升为关键的一环，左右着整个生产。因此，重视抓洗煤这个环节，实质上是重视生产的客观规律，把洗煤摆在一个正确的位置上来对待。我们必须做到：生产任务愈大，用煤愈多，愈要坚持洗煤。
    两年来，我们已经积累了许多洗煤炼焦的经验，创造了许多土洋结合的解决洗煤设备和洗煤技术的好办法。只要我们认真地、踏踏实实地抓紧洗煤这个环节，就一定能够做到一切炼焦用煤都经过洗选，就一定能够使焦炭质量和产量来一个新的飞跃，从而促进和保证钢铁生产来一个大幅度的增长。
