Xinhua News Agency, September 23rd: Reporter Zhu Jigong reports: Xiao Qingsen, a 23-year-old Communist Party member from the Chengguan People's Commune in Miyun, Beijing, is now the secretary of the Communist Youth League branch in Xiatun Village. He listens to the Party and has resolutely stayed on the front line of agricultural production for five years. He has established lofty ambitions, fought alongside the villagers year after year, and transformed more than 600 mu of sandy land on the Chaobai River滩 into farmland, turning this poor mountain village, which had been short of grain for many years, into a village with surplus grain, and changing the impoverished face of his hometown.

In the summer of 1955, Xiao Qingsen graduated from junior high school. At that time, the Party was calling on young people to settle down in the countryside and build a new socialist countryside. Yao Tinghua, the secretary of the Party branch, said to him: "To change the poor face of our hometown, we need you to take the lead and set an example!" Xiao Qingsen repeatedly thought about this sentence and felt that the Party's words were golden rules, so he decided to stay and participate in agricultural production.

After half a year of hard work, Xiao Qingsen, encouraged by the Party, passed the labor test. At this time, the Party branch sent him to an agricultural technology training class held in the county to study. Xiao Qingsen broadened his horizons in the training class and realized that there was much to be done in agricultural production. In the spring of 1956, as soon as he returned to the village, he formed a youth experimental field group with eight young people, with the support of Party branch secretary Yao Tinghua, to carry out experiments on transforming mountain land. However, Ma Dehe, the production team leader, was a bit conservative. He stated that the production team's foundation was weak. If the young people wanted to conduct experimental fields, the team would not be responsible for the required fertilizer and labor, and each mu would have to contract for 400 jin. Xiao Qingsen, with the support of Party branch secretary Yao Tinghua, resolutely accepted this task. The Party branch also specially invited a technician from the county to be their consultant.

The experiment began, and the first hurdle was the lack of fertilizer. They decided to dig river mud on the river bank. At that time, the ground was frozen and the weather was cold, and the ice in the river had not melted. Xiao Qingsen was the first to jump in, and everyone else rushed to jump into the water and start working. They carried the dug-out river mud in grass sacks and baskets to the fields. The cold wind blew the mud on their bodies, and everyone looked like they were wearing a suit of black-scaled armor, making a "crunching" sound as they walked. But Xiao Qingsen and the young men persevered. After they finished digging the river mud, Xiao Qingsen took the lead in collecting small ashes, emptying toilets, and turning over sheds from house to house, finding more than 20 kinds of fertilizer sources. After several days of hard work, they applied more than 10,000 jin of fertilizer per mu of cornfield, four or five times more than ordinary fields.

The seedlings emerged from the soil. During thinning, they entered the second stage of competing for high yield: "rational close planting". They left more than 3,000 seedlings per mu, more than twice as many as ordinary cornfields. At that time, the villagers were not accustomed to close planting, and some people doubted the effectiveness of doing so. At this time, some of the young men couldn't hold their breath, but Xiao Qingsen insisted on trying to get a result. He carefully persuaded the individual team members who were impatient, and after close planting, he followed up with careful management, making the corn seedlings grow very strong. But, unfortunately, it didn't rain for more than a month that summer, and seeing the corn wither, Xiao Qingsen resolutely led everyone to carry water and irrigate the fields day and night. When the water source was insufficient, they quickly dug a well in three days, repaired a well, and quickly watered, so that the seedlings quickly turned green. In half a year, they did not slack off, applying fertilizer five times, watering three times, and hoeing seven times. As a result, the 23.5 mu experimental field averaged 1,040 jin per mu, 640 jin more than the original contracted amount. People couldn't help but praise: "The young men have good technology, they work vigorously, they are really better than Luo Cheng!"

This was the first time that Miyun County had a yield of 1,000 jin per mu, and the county held an on-site meeting here. Xiao Qingsen's group became the first red banner in the county for creating high yields on barren sandy land. This year, Xiao Qingsen joined the Communist Youth League.

Xiatun Village is located on the banks of the Chaobai River. The east side of the village is the mountain, and the west side is the river, but "relying on the mountain, the mountain is not green, relying on the water, the water does not flow." In the past, people lived a hard life of "barren sandy land and dry river ditches, nine out of ten years are not harvested."

In 1957, some young people from Xiatun Village were transferred to participate in industrial construction. Some people looked forward to going to big cities, thinking that the work there was easier and the life was better. Xiao Qingsen's wife also hoped that he would go to the city. Xiao Qingsen remembered the hard lives of the villagers before liberation and the bright future of his hometown, especially the words of Party branch secretary Yao Tinghua: "If our village can plant rice on the dry riverbed and wheat on the sandy land west of the village, and corn on the three rivers above and below, then we will uproot poverty, and the whole village will turn over in your generation." He further resolved to work in agricultural production to the end, and said to his wife: "If everyone runs to the city, who will grow crops and who will produce grain? Who will produce raw materials for industry! I will do it to the end!"

"To uproot poverty, we must improve the soil." After the success of the high yield in the experimental field, Xiao Qingsen often pondered this question. Sometimes when everyone was resting, he would squat in the field and think carefully. One day, a strong wind suddenly rose, and yellow sand filled the sky, stinging people's faces. Everyone hid in the house, but he ran to the field against the wind and sand, squatting down and carefully watching the young seedlings struggling in the storm. He found that the seedlings on the sandy land with a little clay were firmly rooted, grew well, and were not afraid of the wind; the seedlings without attached clay were blown away. He jumped up happily: "We have found a way to change the sandy land!"

The Party branch supported his idea of transforming the soil, and led their experimental field group of 29 young men to formally establish a youth experimental farm, with Xiao Qingsen as the farm director. In the winter of 1957, Xiao Qingsen braved the wind and snow, leading a group of young men, began the battle to seize yellow soil behind Yinyang Mountain. After several days of hard work, they mixed an average of more than 20,000 jin of yellow soil per mu into the 23.5 mu of sandy land. They also studied with technicians, digging windbreaks in the fields to fix the soil, conserve moisture, and protect the seedlings, plus plenty of fertilizer and water. This year, the densely planted corn grew exceptionally well. Despite experiencing drought and hail, the average yield per mu reached 1,074.6 jin. Under their influence, several nearby production teams also successively turned more than 2,000 mu of thin sandy land into fertile fields.

Under the leadership of the Party branch and the impetus of Xiao Qingsen and others, the agricultural production of Xiatun Village achieved one victory after another, which was inspiring. Of the village's total of more than 1,400 mu of thin sandy land, nearly half has been improved, of which more than 300 mu has become fertile land. Before 1955, the average yield per mu in the village was only 100 jin, and the population of more than 500 people required the state to subsidize more than 30,000 jin of grain every year. By 1956, this historically grain-deficient "poor village" had a surplus of grain. In 1958, the average yield per mu was more than doubled compared to 1956. In the office of the Xiatun Production Team, more than 20 red flags and certificates of merit are hung, but Xiao Qingsen and his partners are not arrogant or impetuous. On the contrary, they are more humble and hardworking, determined to keep going and do everything possible to continue to increase production. (Attached picture)

    有志青年到广阔的农村去施展本领
    萧庆森在家乡苦干五年誉满乡里
    据新华社23日讯　记者朱继功报道：北京市密云城关人民公社二十三岁的共产党员萧庆森，现在是下屯村的共青团支部书记。他听党的话，五年来坚决留在农业生产第一线，树立雄心大志，和全村群众一起连年奋战，把潮白河滩上六百多亩沙地改造成粮田，使这个多年缺粮的穷山村变成了余粮村，改变了家乡的穷困面貌。
    1955年夏天，萧庆森高小毕业。这时，党正号召青年们在农村安家落户，建设社会主义新农村。党支部书记姚廷华对他说：“要改变家乡的穷困面貌，就需要你们带头作出榜样来！”萧庆森反复地思考了这句话，觉得党的话是金玉良言，就决定留下来参加农业生产。
    经过半年的艰苦努力，萧庆森在党的鼓励下过了劳动关。这时，党支部把他送到县里举办的农业技术训练班去学习。萧庆森在训练班里扩大了眼界，知道农业生产上也大有可为。1956年春天他一回村，就在党支部书记姚廷华的支持下，同八名青年一起组成了一个青年试验田小组，要搞改造山地的试验。但是，生产队队长马德和有点保守思想，他声明，生产队底子薄，青年们要搞试验田，需要的肥料和劳力，队里一概不管，每亩还要包产四百斤。萧庆森在党支部书记姚廷华的支持下，坚决接受了这个任务。党支部还特地从县里请来一位技术员作他们的顾问。
    试验开始了，第一关是缺肥。他们决定到河岸挖河泥。当时地冻天寒，河里冰凌未化，萧庆森第一个跳下去，大伙也就争先跳下水干起来。挖出的河泥，他们就用草袋背、用筐挑，送到地里。寒风吹着他们身上的泥浆，每个人都像穿着一身乌鳞铠甲，走起路来“咔嚓”、“咔嚓”地响。但是萧庆森和小伙子们坚持下来了。他们挖完了河泥，萧庆森又带头挨家挨户收小灰、掏厕所、翻棚圈，找到二十多种肥源。经过几天苦战，他们在每亩玉米地里下了万斤多肥，比一般田要多四、五倍。
    苗儿出土了。间苗时，进入争夺高产的第二关：“合理密植”。他们每亩留了三千多棵苗，比一般玉米田多一倍以上。当时，老乡们没有密植的习惯，有些人怀疑这样做的效果。这时，有的小伙子就沉不住气了，但是萧庆森坚持要试出个结果来。他细心地说服了个别沉不住气的组员，在密植后紧跟上精心管理，使玉米苗长得很粗壮。但是，不凑巧这年夏天一个多月没下雨，眼看着玉米枯黄起来，萧庆森坚定不移地带领大伙星夜担水浇地，水源不足，他们就在三天中打了一眼井，修了一眼井，赶紧浇水，使禾苗很快转青了。在半年中，他们毫不懈怠，作到了上五次肥，浇三次水，锄七遍。结果，二十三点五亩试验田，平均亩产一千零四十斤，比原先包产数还多六百四十斤。人们不由得连连称赞：“小伙子技术好，干得泼，真是赛罗成！”
    这是密云县第一次出现亩产千斤，县里在这里召开了现场会议。萧庆森小组成了全县在荒沙薄地首创高产的第一面红旗。这一年，萧庆森加入了共青团。
    下屯村在潮白河畔，村的东边是山，西边是河，可是“靠山山不绿，靠水水不流”，过去人们过着“荒沙薄地干河沟，十年倒有九不收”的苦日子。
    1957年，下屯村一部分青年被调去参加工业建设。有些人就盼望着到大城市去，认为那里工作轻，生活好。萧庆森的妻子也希望他到城里去。萧庆森想起了解放前乡亲们的困苦生活和家乡的美好前途，特别是党支部书记姚廷华对他说的话：“咱村如果能在干河套上种上稻子，村西沙地种上小麦，上下三道河种上玉米，那时节就拔了穷根子，全村就在你们这一代翻身了。”他进一步下定了农业生产干到底的决心，对他妻子说：“人人都往城里跑，谁种庄稼谁打粮？谁为工业生产原料呢！我要干就干到底！”
    “要拔掉穷根子，就得改良土壤”，在试验场高产成功后，萧庆森经常琢磨这个问题。有时大伙歇晌，他还蹲在地里细细捉摸。一天大风骤起，黄沙漫天，吹得人脸生痛。大伙都躲到屋里去了，他却迎着风沙跑到地里，蹲下去细看着一棵棵在狂风中挣扎的幼苗。他发现：凡是沙地上有点粘土的，苗儿就扎得牢，长得好，不怕风；没有附着粘土的苗就被刮跑了。他高兴得跳蹦起来：“改变沙地，有了门路了！”
    党支部支持他改造土壤的想法，并且领导他们试验田小组的二十九个小伙子正式成立了青年试验农场，由萧庆森担任场长。1957年冬天，萧庆森冒着风雪，带着一帮小伙子在阴山背后开始了夺黄土的战斗。经过几天苦战，他们在二十三亩半的沙地上，平均每亩掺进了两万多斤黄土。他们又同技术员一起研究，在地里挖了防风壕，固土保墒护苗，再加上粪大水足，这一年密植的玉米长得分外好，尽管经受了旱灾和雹灾，平均亩产量达一千零七十四点六斤。在他们的影响下，附近几个生产队，也接连使两千多亩薄沙地变成了良田。
    在党支部的领导和萧庆森他们的带动下，下屯村的农业生产一个胜利接着一个胜利，振奋人心。全村总共一千四百多亩薄沙地，将近半数经过了土壤改良，其中三百多亩已变成沃土。1955年以前，全村平均亩产粮不过百斤，五百多人口每年还要国家补贴三万多斤粮食。到1956年，这个历来缺粮的“穷村”有了余粮。1958年平均亩产量又比1956年增加一倍以上。下屯生产队办公室里，挂着二十多面大红旗和奖状，但是萧庆森和他的伙伴们不骄不躁，反而更加谦逊、刻苦，决心马不停蹄，千方百计，继续增产。（附图片）
