The Shanxi Jingwei Textile Machinery Factory has cultivated a strong industrial cadre team in the eight years since its establishment by implementing a policy of universal improvement and focusing on key training. In addition to supporting 758 cadres to various locations, the factory currently has 612 cadres, which is 10.2 times more than in the early days of its establishment. Over the years, these cadres have significantly improved their political, cultural, and technical levels.

Upon entering the factory, 40 cadres were illiterate and 52 had only primary school education. Now there are no illiterate cadres or those with only primary school education; the number of cadres with the equivalent of higher primary school education has decreased from 170 to 64, a reduction of 62%; the number of cadres with junior high school education has increased from 160 to 292, an increase of 80%; and the number of cadres with university education has increased from 71 to 96, an increase of 37%. Eleven veteran technical workers in the factory have been promoted to engineers and have taken on technical leadership positions.

Over the past eight years, the Jingwei Textile Machinery Factory Committee of the Chinese Communist Party has consistently listed leading spare-time learning as an important item on its work agenda, conducting regular research and discussions on spare-time learning twice a year. Each workshop has also organized employee education leading groups, reporting the learning progress of each Party member to the Party Committee once a month. Spare-time learning is also a major item of inspection in Party organizational life, with good examples frequently praised and poor ones criticized. Therefore, every Party member actively takes the lead in learning, becoming a vanguard and role model in conquering cultural and scientific technologies. The special study class composed of leading cadres has achieved great success in their studies. Since 1952, they have persevered, participating not only in the factory's spare-time school but also in the correspondence station of Renmin University in 1953. Three cohorts have now graduated, and most have become experts in industrial production. The Party organization has particularly strengthened political and ideological work among cadres, workers, and teachers. Every quarter, it launches inspection, evaluation, and competition activities, establishes pacesetters, and holds on-site meetings to summarize and exchange experiences.

In cultivating and improving cadres, the Jingwei Textile Machinery Factory has closely implemented the policy of "walking on two legs" by universally improving and focusing on key training. Based on the characteristics of production, it emphasizes spare-time learning to universally improve political and cultural levels. After eliminating illiteracy and popularizing primary school education, it divides students into higher primary, junior high, and senior high classes based on theoretical and cultural levels. It has also established a spare-time mechanical college, a financial and economic college, and a medical college, forming a complete educational system from literacy classes to university. Veteran cadres are organized into a special class, which, in addition to insisting on six hours of learning per week, sets aside half a day of work time to invite engineers such as Tao Yuanchang to teach cultural, technical, and production management knowledge, helping veteran cadres quickly familiarize themselves with and master production. Now, the cultural level of the 49 veteran cadres has been raised from primary or higher primary to junior high school or above. For technical cadres and intellectual cadres, the focus is on studying politics, participating in physical labor, and transforming their ideology. Since 1957, 417 people have been sent to the countryside and workshops for labor training, and a system has been established where each person participates in more than one month of physical labor per year. At the same time, cadres who have not received higher education are organized to participate in spare-time mechanical college studies. Various short-term full-time training courses are held for worker-peasant cadres and workers above grade three to systematically improve their cultural and technical levels. Over the past eight years, 134 junior and intermediate technical personnel from worker-peasant backgrounds have been trained, basically meeting the needs of production development. This year, a full-time university has been established, and 26 outstanding cadres and technicians above grade four have been selected for full-time key training.

With the development of production and the continuous improvement of enterprise management, while unifying the study of theory and culture, various short-term business training courses for foremen, drafting, nursing, economic planning, accounting, statistics, dispatching, and recording are held according to different work natures and different specialties, based on the principle of "learn what you do, supplement what you lack". They focus on their own industry work, conduct systematic business learning based on relevant documents and instructions from superior business departments and advanced experiences from various regions, adopting the method of learning, applying, and improving simultaneously. This has played a significant role in improving their business level, improving enterprise management, and promoting current production. For example, before the foreman training class was held, most people had low levels of education and did not understand production management knowledge, making it difficult for them to carry out their work and causing them great ideological distress. After ten months of business learning in 1956, their business level was improved. Over the years, the factory has trained 188 various business cadres. On the basis of short-term spare-time training, 202 cadres and outstanding workers have also been selected and sent to various universities and secondary technical schools in a planned and phased manner for long-term training and further study. In addition, methods such as "seeking advice upon hearing of it," "traveling thousands of miles to learn," "inviting in," and "sending out" are adopted to improve the business and technical levels of cadres. According to incomplete statistics, in the past eight years, 444 people have been sent to other places for study, and more than 4,900 visits have been made to various parts of the country. Universities, technical schools, and fraternal factories and mines have been invited to the factory to give lectures on political theory, scientific and technological courses, and exchange advanced experiences twenty or thirty times. Through learning from experience, the horizons of cadres have been broadened, and they have learned rich advanced experience and technical and business knowledge, which has powerfully promoted production.

    山西经纬纺织机械厂贯彻普遍提高重点培养方针
    迅速壮大工业干部队伍
    本报讯　山西经纬纺织机械厂从建立以来，八年多的时间，培养了一支坚强的工业干部队伍。除支援各地的七百五十八名干部外，只目前厂内的六百十二名干部，就比建厂初期增加了十点二倍。几年来这些干部不论政治、文化、技术水平，都有了显著的提高。
    入厂时，干部中有文盲四十人，初小程度的五十二人，现在已没有文盲和初小文化水平的干部了；原来相当高小程度的有一百七十人，现在只有六十四人，下降了62％；初中程度的干部由原来的一百六十人，增加到二百九十二人，提高了80％；大学程度的干部由原来的七十一人，增加到九十六人，提高了37％。厂内有十一名老技术工人被提升为工程师，担任了技术领导职务。
    八年来，中共经纬纺织机械厂委员会始终把领导业余学习列为工作中的一项重要议程，每年要定期对业余学习研究、讨论两次。各车间也同样组织了职工教育领导小组，每月定期向党委汇报一次每个党员的学习情况，党的组织生活中也把业余学习列为一项主要检查内容，经常表扬好的，批评不好的。因此，每个党员都积极带头学习，成为攻克文化、科学技术的尖兵和榜样。由领导干部组成的特别学习班，学习得很有成绩。他们从1952年以来，八年如一日，除坚持参加厂内的业余学校学习外，还在1953年参加了人民大学的函授站学习，现在已经结业了三期，大部分已变成工业生产上的内行。党组织特别加强了在干部、工人和教师中的政治思想工作。每季都要发动开展检查评比竞赛，树立标兵，召开现场会议总结、交流经验。
    经纬纺织机械厂在培养提高干部中，紧紧贯彻了普遍提高和重点培养，在普遍提高的基础上，着重强调重点培养的两条腿走路方针。这就是根据生产的特点，以业余学习为主，普遍提高政治和文化水平。在扫除文盲、普及初小教育之后，又根据理论和文化程度的高低，划分为高小、初中、高中班，并成立了业余机械学院、财经学院、医学院，从扫盲班到大学形成了一套完整的教育体系。老干部还单独组织了一个特别班，每周除坚持六个小时的学习外，又抽出半天的工作时间，请工程师陶源长等教授文化、技术和生产管理等知识，帮助老干部迅速熟悉掌握生产。现在四十九个老干部，文化程度已由原来的初小、高小分别提高到初中以上水平。对技术干部和知识分子干部，着重以学习政治，参加体力劳动锻炼，改造思想为主，从1957年以来，先后已下放农村、车间进行劳动锻炼的有四百一十七名，每人每年参加一个月以上体力劳动也已形成制度。同时，对其中没有受过高等教育的干部，组织他们参加业余机械学院学习。对工农干部和三级以上工人，举办了各种短期脱产训练班，系统提高他们的文化、技术水平。八年来，共培养出工农出身的初、中级技术人员一百三十四人，基本上满足了生产发展的需要。今年又举办了全日制大学，抽调了二十六名优秀干部和四级以上技工进行脱产重点培养。
    随着生产的发展和企业管理水平的不断提高，在统一学习理论和文化的同时，根据“做什么学什么，缺什么补什么”的原则，又按不同工作性质，不同专业，举办了工长、绘图、护士、经济计划、会计、统计、调度、记录等各种短期业务学习训练班。他们以本行业工作为主，根据上级业务部门有关文件和指示，各地的先进经验，采取边学、边用、边提高的方法，进行系统的业务学习。这对提高他们的业务水平，改进企业管理，推动当前生产起了很大的作用。如工长训练班在未办以前，因为大部分人文化低，不懂得生产管理知识，工作展不开，思想很苦恼。1956年经过十个月的业务学习，提高了业务水平。几年来，全厂就培养了各种业务干部一百八十八名。在短期业余训练的基础上，还有计划地、分期分批地选送了二百零二个干部和优秀工人，到各高等学校、中技学校进行长期培养深造。另外，还采取闻风拜师，千里取经，请进来，派出去的办法，提高干部的业务、技术水平。据不完全统计，八年来，派出到外地学习的有四百四十四人，到全国各地参观访问的有四千九百多人次。请各高等学校、技术学校、兄弟厂矿来厂讲授政治理论、科学技术课程，交流先进经验的有二、三十次。通过取经学习，扩大了干部的视野，学到了丰富的先进经验和技术、业务知识，有力地促进了生产。
