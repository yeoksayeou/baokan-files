　　This is Only Two Years
　　——Investigation Report on Huangdu People's Commune, Jiading County, Shanghai
　　Communications Group of the Jiading County Committee of the Communist Party of China

　　Huangdu People's Commune in Jiading County, Shanghai, is an ordinary people's commune in the rural areas of Shanghai. It is said to be ordinary because, whether from the scope of Jiading County or from the scope of the suburbs, it is a general commune, and therefore has great representativeness.

　　Huangdu People's Commune was born in the autumn of 1958. The entire commune has 4,068 households, 17,445 people, and 8,203 laborers, managing 31,263 mu of land, divided into 15 agricultural production teams and one fishery production team.

　　Taking Grain as the Key Link, Promoting the Comprehensive Development of Five Sectors

　　In the past two years, Huangdu People's Commune has first ensured the priority development of grain production, while also promoting the continuous increase in the production of cotton and oil crops. The following is a list of the yields per mu of these major crops in recent years:

　　Crop　　1957　　1958　　1959　　1960

　　Rice　　526 jin　700 jin　738 jin

　　Wheat　　150 jin　168 jin　308 jin　321 jin

　　Cotton　　117 jin　180 jin　209 jin

　　Rapeseed　133 jin　117 jin　176 jin　182 jin

　　It can be seen from the above table that since the establishment of the People's Commune, the yields of various crops have increased substantially. Although rice and cotton have not yet been harvested this year, the seedlings are generally better than last year. This year, rice is expected to have a high yield because of timely transplanting, sufficient fertilizer, and careful management, with heading about ten days earlier than last year.

　　While vigorously developing grain, Huangdu People's Commune, in accordance with the policy of serving the city with suburban areas, actively develops the production of vegetables, animal husbandry, poultry, and fisheries and other non-staple foods, realizing the great revolution of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline production, and fishery.

　　The following table shows the increase in the total output of several major non-staple foods:

　　Product　　Unit　　1957　　1958　　1959　　January-August 1960

　　Vegetables　Dan　　494,023　630,984　881,231　579,147

　　Pigs　　Head　　6,602　　8,677　　11,593　 16,196

　　Aquatic Products　Dan　　3,405　　4,792　　6,794　　6,767

　　Poultry　　Pieces　　9,036　　13,770　 18,605　 40,138

　　Eggs　　Jin　　6,320　　9,982　　15,400　 14,408

　　Commune-run industry is a product of communization. In the past two years, the entire commune has established 16 factories for agricultural machinery, pesticides, processing of agricultural and sideline products, and comprehensive utilization. The total output value in 1958 was 420,000 yuan, which reached 1,214,300 yuan in 1959, an increase of 1.9 times. From January to August this year, it was 2,800,490 yuan, an increase of 2.7 times over the same period last year, achieving self-sufficiency in small and medium-sized farm tools, lime burning, and the production of 666 pesticide powder.

　　What factors have promoted the vigorous development of production?

　　Reasonable Layout, Making the Best Use of the Land

　　Reasonably adjusting the layout and arranging various crops according to local conditions is an important factor in the great development of production in Huangdu People's Commune over the past two years. Before communization, the interplanted land of various production teams in the entire commune was spread across two counties, six districts, and eighteen townships, and the crop layout was very chaotic. During the period of advanced cooperatives, due to the small scope, crop arrangement was difficult. Regardless of the terrain, grain, cotton, and vegetables had to be planted a little, which not only made it impossible to plant according to local conditions, but also distracted the energy of leaders and the masses. This kind of "piecemeal" planting method could not rapidly increase yields. Yangjia, Lianxing, Gujia, and other production teams all had some low-lying areas where the cotton planted was often waterlogged. In good years, each mu could only harvest 60 to 70 jin of seed cotton, and in the event of flooding, almost no cotton was harvested. Some production teams with slightly higher terrain all had some leaky paddy fields. After planting rice, the water would leak out as soon as it was poured in, and the bottom of the field was often exposed to the sky, turning the rice into "dry rice," with each mu yielding less than 200 to 300 jin. In addition, most of the rice areas were dry and hard, and the yield of vegetables planted was very low, with an average daily harvest of less than 10 jin per mu. An unreasonable layout clearly hindered the development of production.

　　The establishment of the People's Commune created conditions for fundamentally changing this situation. The interplanted land of the commune in other counties and neighboring areas was comprehensively adjusted among the communes by means of exchanging land with each other. Under the guidance of the national plan, the commune made an overall plan for crop layout according to the terrain conditions and past habits, determining that the low-lying water network area would be used as a rice production base, the higher-lying area would be used as a fixed grain-cotton interplanting area, and the high ridges and large areas of slopes along the Wusong River would be planted with vegetables. All water surfaces of large and small rivers and ponds were assigned to the fishery production team for operation.

　　In 1959, the new layout of "rice in the north, vegetables in the south, and grain and cotton in the east" of Huangdu Commune was initially formed. Due to the reasonable layout, strengthened leadership, and concentrated use of labor, it was possible to truly plant according to local conditions and make the best use of the land. This year, rice, wheat, vegetables, cotton, and oil crops have been planted in continuous plots, greatly reducing the threat of drought and flood disasters. For example, Yangjia production team had 120 mu of "Bailong Fields." Before the establishment of the commune, 70 mu of rice and 50 mu of cotton were mixed together. When it rained, it was often a vast expanse of white. In 1958, each mu of rice yielded more than 400 jin, and cotton only yielded more than 50 jin of seed cotton. After the establishment of the People's Commune, all of this land was planted with rice, forming a continuous area. Last year, each mu yielded 905 jin. The commune members said: "With the People's Commune, the land is connected, the rice harvest is great, and the White Dragon flies into the sky." After the high ridges and slopes on both sides of the Wusong River were planted with vegetables, a new base for vegetable production famous in the suburbs was established. There is a lot of tidal mud here, and it is convenient to transport fertilizer, which is suitable for planting various vegetables. For example, radishes are planted on high ridges, and the mud loosens and grows quickly and large. Yellow buds and various green leafy vegetables are planted on the slopes, and they mature quickly. The second team of Xujia production team has 15 mu of slope land. In the past, when planting barley, each mu only yielded 150 jin, and cotton only yielded about 100 jin of seed cotton. After the wheat harvest this year, early yellow bud vegetables were planted, and one harvest yielded 50 dan, with an output value of 250 yuan. Now, autumn cabbage has also been planted. Because it is located on the edge of the Wusong River, the harvested vegetables can be loaded onto boats and sent to the urban area, which greatly reduces the transfer procedures and avoids losses caused by rotten vegetables.

　　Building Farmland, Overcoming Drought and Flood

　　Because the labor force and means of production of the People's Commune can be uniformly arranged, dispatched, and used within a larger scope, it is possible to carry out large-scale farmland capital construction and increase the ability to resist and overcome natural disasters.

　　Among the 31,263 mu of cultivated land in Huangdu People's Commune, there are more than 4,600 mu of high ridges, more than 3,900 mu of slopes, and more than 3,200 mu of low-lying fields. In the past, whenever there was heavy rain, the water from the ridges flowed into the slopes, and the water from the slopes poured into the low-lying fields, causing floods; when the weather was clear, the low-lying fields still had standing water, and the ridge and slope land had already cracked. It was truly "drought when the sky is clear, and flood when it rains." During the period of advanced cooperatives, under the leadership of the Party and the government, people cooperated several times to build water conservancy projects, which played a certain role in overcoming natural disasters, but due to the small scale of the advanced cooperatives and insufficient funds, many fundamental constructions could not be carried out.

　　After the establishment of Huangdu People's Commune, large-scale farmland capital construction was carried out. Under the guidance of the policy of "overall planning, unified arrangement, phased breakthroughs, and year-round implementation," the work of leveling ridges and slopes was first carried out in the six production teams in the vegetable area. In the first year of the establishment of the commune, more than 2,000 mu of land was leveled in the entire commune, which not only expanded the cultivated area, but also obtained a bumper harvest of vegetables; in the second year, the commune members saw the benefits of leveling the land, so they mustered greater enthusiasm and transformed more than 4,000 mu of uneven land into square and tidy garden fields.

　　Water conservancy projects were built on a large scale. On the leveled land in the vegetable area, ditches for both drainage and irrigation were built. Nearly 2,000 mu of slope land in the entire commune was converted into water pit fields, ensuring the water supply for green leafy vegetables that cannot be without water for a day. More than 3,000 mu of low-lying fields in the rice area have also mobilized commune members to build and reinforce more than 10,000 meters of embankments, apply large amounts of river mud and garbage, and transform them. Since the beginning of this year, the commune has also built two electric irrigation stations in the rice area and built 8,920 meters of canals, irrigating more than 3,400 mu of farmland. These projects have withstood the rare drought and flood tests this year and have played a huge role. Around July, after 30 consecutive days of severe drought, the more than 3,000 mu of vegetable water pit fields along the Wusong River were still sufficiently watered. In early August, the rainfall reached 250 mm in one day, but because most of the high ridges and slopes had reduced slopes and built ditches, the water泻 from the high places was cut off, flowing into the ditches and draining into the river. More than 600 mu of Chaidang fields in the Lianxing production team were flooded, leaving only the rice tips, but because the embankment was built firmly, the commune transferred seven water pumps from various teams, and drained all the accumulated water into the river in one day and one night. The commune members said: "If it weren't for the People's Commune, the Chaidang fields would have only yielded a few stalks of thatch."

　　Another important aspect of farmland construction is to vigorously increase fertilizer application. Before communization, cotton and broad beans were not fertilized, and grain and vegetables were rarely fertilized. A considerable part of the paddy fields and wheat fields, due to the distance from the river and the lack of fertilizer accumulation, were often planted blank, and no topdressing was applied after planting. People called them "vegetarian fields." After the establishment of the commune, the entire Party and all the people were mobilized. While vigorously raising pigs to accumulate fertilizer, they also dug river mud and transported fertilizer from other places, greatly increasing the amount of fertilizer. Now, cotton fields and broad bean fields are fertilized, and the fertilizer for paddy fields is increasing year by year. According to a survey of Henghe production team, which mainly grows rice, in 1957, the advanced cooperative applied 50 dan of grass and river mud as base fertilizer per mu of paddy field, 80 dan in 1958, 130 dan in 1959, and the fertilizer application increased to 150 dan this year.

　　Production has developed year after year, and the public accumulation of the People's Commune has become more and more. With the increase in accumulation, it can be used to expand reproduction and purchase large and medium-sized agricultural machinery that the advanced cooperatives could not afford to purchase, improve the level of agricultural mechanization, and further ensure the continued leap forward in production. When Huangdu People's Commune was established in 1958, it retained a public accumulation of more than 409,000 yuan. In 1959, the public accumulation retained was more than 903,000 yuan, an increase of 1.2 times over 1958. Now the fixed assets of the commune have reached more than 1 million yuan, an increase of nearly one time over the end of 1958, averaging more than 240 yuan per household. In the past two years, the commune has successively purchased eight tractors, thirty water pumps, one steam turbine, one truck, built two electric irrigation stations, and a large number of farm boats and various threshing machines, harvesters, etc.

　　Large-scale Cooperation, Making the Best Use of Talent

　　The comprehensive and large-scale increase in the production of various crops in Huangdu People's Commune is also the result of the unified use of labor within a larger scope by the People's Commune.

　　Large-scale cooperation is one of the keys to solving the shortage of labor. The rice area here is large and the labor force is small. Some teams have to bear the task of cultivating five and a half mu of land with one laborer. After the wheat harvest, fertilizing, plowing, and transplanting, many farm works are concentrated together, which is particularly tense. The vegetable area is always engaged in three major events: harvesting, managing, and planting. When it comes to spring vegetable sowing and autumn vegetable sowing, it is necessary to prepare the land, sow, and water. Sometimes it cannot be arranged, so I have to watch the land being deserted. During the period of advanced cooperatives, whether grain farmers or vegetable farmers, everyone did their own work and did not take care of each other, and as a result, production was affected. After the establishment of the People's Commune, this contradiction was resolved. Huangdu People's Commune, according to the different seasons of rice and vegetable harvesting and planting, made overall arrangements for the labor force of the entire commune, and organized large-scale labor cooperation among the various production teams in accordance with the principle of equivalent exchange. Whenever it is the rice and rapeseed transplanting season, the various production teams in the vegetable area organize labor to support the rice area; when the vegetable area enters a critical period of production, the various production teams in the grain area also take the initiative to organize labor and animal power to support the vegetable area. In the past two years, more than 13,500 workdays have been mutually supported. This large-scale cooperation effectively solved the problem of labor shortage during busy farming seasons. During the advanced cooperative period, rice transplanting was often dragged to the Little Heat, and rapeseed transplanting had to be dragged to the Light Snow. In 1959, Gujia, Laozhai, and other grain-producing teams generally finished transplanting one or two days after the Summer Solstice, and rapeseed transplanting was completed two or three days after the Beginning of Winter. This year, because both sides of the cooperation sent "elite soldiers" and took a serious and responsible attitude, and would not return to the team if the task was not completed, rice transplanting was basically done before the Summer Solstice, grabbing the season.

　　With the development of production, the demand for labor has greatly increased. The People's Commune has built a large number of collective welfare undertakings, providing an important source for increasing the labor force. In the past two years, after the Huangdu People's Commune has established various collective welfare undertakings, it has liberated 60% of the female commune members, who accounted for the commune's total labor force, from tedious housework. They wholeheartedly participated in production, forming a huge industrial army. Zhang A'mei, a 35-year-old female commune member of Xujia production team, is a mother of eight children. The burden of housework such as cooking, washing, and taking care of children overwhelmed her. After the establishment of the People's Commune, she ate in the canteen, and the children went to nurseries and kindergartens. The laundry was done by the laundry group, and the cleaning group took care of the toilets. She devoted herself to production and was in a happy mood and full of energy. This year, she and other commune members planted rapeseed experimental fields on four mu of low-lying land, and obtained higher yields than good fields.

　　In various production and construction undertakings, Huangdu People's Commune not only uniformly used labor within a larger scope, but also paid attention to the rational arrangement of labor, proceeding from the needs of production and taking care of the different situations of each commune member, giving play to their strengths, and making the best use of their talents. For example, young people have the most enterprising spirit. Each production team has organized youth commando teams to specialize in tackling difficulties and charging forward; during the large-field production, female commune members who are meticulous and willing to study are organized to control insects and prepare the land; although the elderly commune members are physically weaker, they have experience in farming, so they are responsible for looking after the fields, guarding the warehouse, and managing the production of "ten-side" gaps; women who are good at managing housework are assigned to be cooks, nursery workers, and educators. This division of labor and cooperation not only ensures the needs of the great development of various undertakings, but also further mobilizes the enthusiasm of the commune members.

　　Increasing Production of Commodities to Support the Country

　　The concentrated and large-scale production of the People's Commune has continuously developed commodity production and continuously increased the commodity rate. Taking rapeseed, meat pigs, and aquatic products as examples: 4,728 dan of rapeseed were sold in 1958, an increase of 1.5% compared to 1957, with a commodity rate of 99.5%; the sales volume in 1959 increased by 127.4% compared to 1958, with a commodity rate of 99.7%; this year, it increased by another 10.6% compared to last year, with a commodity rate of 99.7%. 2,400 meat pigs were marketed in 1958, an increase of 31.9% compared to 1957, with a commodity rate of 87.2%; the marketed volume in 1959 increased by 14.9% compared to 1958, with a commodity rate of 91.5%; in the first half of this year, it increased by 65.9% compared to the same period last year, with a commodity rate of 94.6%.

　　The development of commodity production is not only reflected in the increase in quantity and the increase in commodity rate, but also in the increase in variety and quality, as well as balanced supply. Taking the vegetable production of Nigang production team as an example: this production team marketed 67 varieties of vegetables in 1958, which increased to 121 in 1959, and has increased to 193 this year. The supply situation in the off-season has also been improved year by year.

　　The development of commodity production in the People's Commune has powerfully supported national construction and the supply of non-staple foods to cities, and has also increased a large amount of cash income for the commune to exchange for means of production and means of subsistence. This has further strengthened the relationship between urban and rural areas, strengthened the worker-peasant alliance, and improved the lives of farmers.

　　＊ ＊ ＊

　　With the rapid development of production, the living standards of the commune members of Huangdu Commune have also been continuously improved. In 1959, the average income per capita in the entire commune reached 119 yuan. In the Huangdu area, this is a remarkable event. According to the survey: in the past, the income of a prosperous middle peasant family of five in the rice area averaged only about 400 yuan a year, an average of about 80 yuan per person, of which 200 yuan was spent on food, and another 200 yuan was used for clothing and daily necessities; the income of prosperous middle peasants who grew more vegetables was slightly higher, only about 500 yuan. Now, the lives of the commune members have exceeded this level.

　　The achievements made by Huangdu People's Commune in the past two years are inseparable from the correct leadership of the Party. The Party organization of this commune, under the leadership of the municipal and county committees, conscientiously implements the Party's policies and actively leads the masses to strive to run the People's Commune well. After two years of testing, the Party's leadership has become stronger and stronger, the ranks of cadres and activists have become larger and larger, and the commune members, with poor and lower-middle peasants as the backbone, have become more and more closely united around the Party. They regard the People's Commune as a source of common happiness and place all their beautiful hopes on the People's Commune.

　　In the years to come, the commune members of Huangdu People's Commune will surely hold high the red flag of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Commune, work hard, further exert the enormous power of the People's Commune, develop production at high speed, and create a better and happier life.

    这仅仅是两年
　　——上海市嘉定县黄渡人民公社调查报告
　　中共嘉定县委通讯组
    嘉定县黄渡人民公社，是上海农村一个普通的人民公社。说它是普通的，因为不论从嘉定县的范围来说，或是从郊区范围来说，都是个一般的公社，因而具有很大的代表性。
    黄渡人民公社是1958年秋天诞生的。全社四千零六十八户，一万七千四百四十五人，八千二百零三个劳动力，经营着三万一千二百六十三亩土地，分为十五个农业生产队和一个渔业生产队。
          以粮为纲　五业俱兴
      两年来，黄渡人民公社首先确保粮食生产的优先发展，同时又促使棉花和油料作物的连年增产。现将这几种主要作物近几年亩产量列表于下：
    作物　1957年　1958年　1959年　1960年
    水稻　526斤　700斤　738斤
    小麦　150斤　168斤　308斤　321斤
    棉花　117斤　180斤　209斤
    油菜　133斤　117斤　176斤　182斤
    从上表可以看出，人民公社成立以来，各种作物都是大幅度增产的。今年水稻和棉花虽未收获，但苗禾普遍比去年好。今年水稻由于移栽及时，肥料足，管得细，比去年提早十天左右抽穗，高产大有希望。
    在大办粮食的同时，黄渡人民公社根据郊区为城市服务的方针，积极发展蔬菜、畜牧、家禽和渔业等副食品生产，实现农林牧副渔五线大革命。
    下表是几种主要副食品总产量的增长情况
    品称　单位　1957　1958　1959　1960年1—8月
    蔬菜　担　494，023　630，984　881，231　579，147
    猪　头　6，602　8，677　11，593　16，196
    水产　担　3，405　4，792　6，794　6，767
    家禽　只　9，036　13，770　18，605　40，138
    蛋　斤　6，320　9，982　15，400　14，408
    社办工业是公社化的产物。两年来，全公社已办起农业机械、农药、农副产品加工、综合利用等十六个工厂。1958年的总产值为四十二万元，1959年达到一百二十一万四千三百多元，增长了一点九倍。今年1至8月为二百八十万零四千九百多元，比去年同期增长了二点七倍，做到中小农具自己制，石灰自己烧，六六六药粉自己造。
    是什么因素促使了生产的蓬勃发展呢？
          合理布局　地尽其利
    合理调整布局，因地制宜地安排各种农作物，这是黄渡人民公社两年来生产大发展的一个重要因素。公社化以前，全公社各个生产队的插花地，遍及两县、六区、十八乡，作物布局非常杂乱。高级社时，由于范围小，作物安排困难，不论地势高低，粮食、棉花和蔬菜，都得种上一点，这样既不能因地种植，又使领导和群众精力分散。这种“零打碎敲”的种植方法，产量不能很快增长。杨家、联星和顾家等生产队，都有一部分洼地，种植的棉花经常受涝，丰年每亩也只收籽棉六七十斤，遇到水淹，几乎朵棉无收。有些地势稍高的生产队，都有一部分漏水田，种了稻，戽进水就漏掉，时常田底朝天，水稻变“旱稻”，一亩收不到两三百斤。此外，稻区大都是沟干地，土质僵硬，种植的蔬菜产量很低，每亩每天平均收获量不到十斤。布局不合理，显然地阻碍着生产的发展。
    人民公社的建立，为根本上改变这种状况创造了条件。公社在外县和邻近地区的插花地，在各公社之间以互相换地的办法作了全面调整。在国家计划指导下，公社根据地势情况和历年的习惯，作出了作物布局的总体规划，确定将地势较低的水网地带作为水稻生产基地，将地势较高的地区作为固定的粮棉夹种地区，将沿吴淞江的高岗和大面积的坡地种植蔬菜，大江小河和浜头的水面全部划给渔业生产队经营。
    1959年，黄渡公社北稻、南菜、东粮棉的新布局初步形成。由于布局合理，领导力量加强，劳动力集中使用，就能够真正做到因地制宜，地尽其利。今年稻、麦、菜、棉和油料作物，做到了连片种植，大大减轻了旱涝灾害的威胁。如杨家生产队有一百二十亩“白龙田”，公社成立前，七十亩水稻和五十亩棉花混杂一起，天下雨时，常常白茫茫一片，1958年，水稻每亩收四百多斤，棉花只收籽棉五十多斤。人民公社成立后，这片土地全部种了水稻，连成一片，去年每亩收到九百零五斤。社员说：“有了人民公社，土地连成片，水稻大丰收，白龙飞上天。”吴淞江两岸的高岗、坡地种植蔬菜作物以后，建立了郊区有名的蔬菜生产新基地。这里潮泥地多，运肥便当，适宜种植各种蔬菜，如高岗上种萝卜，泥松长得快，长得大；坡地上种黄芽菜和各种绿叶菜，成熟也很快。许家生产队第二小队，有十五亩坡地，过去种大元麦时，每亩只收一百五十斤，棉花也只收籽棉一百斤左右，今年麦收后，种了早黄芽菜，一熟就收五十担，产值二百五十元，现在秋卷心菜也已种下。由于地处吴淞江边，蔬菜收下就可以装船送往市区，大大减少了中转手续，避免了因烂菜而遭致的损失。
            建设农田　战胜旱涝
    由于人民公社的劳动力和生产资料可以在更大的范围内作统一的安排、调度和使用，因此就有条件大兴农田基本建设，增加抗拒和战胜自然灾害的能力。
    在黄渡人民公社三万一千二百六十三亩耕地中，有四千六百多亩高岗，三千九百多亩坡地，三千二百多亩洼田。过去，一遇大雨，岗水流进坡，坡水灌进洼田，酿成涝灾；天晴时，洼田还有积水，岗坡土地已经龟裂。真是“天晴就旱，雨落就涝”。高级社时，人们在党和政府领导下，曾几次协作，兴修水利，对战胜自然灾害起了一定的作用，但是由于高级社规模小，资金不足，许多根本性的建设无法进行。
    黄渡人民公社成立后，大规模地开展了农田基本建设。在“全面规划，统筹安排，分期突击，常年进行”的方针指导下，首先在菜区的六个生产队进行了平整岗坡工作。公社成立的第一年，全公社平整的土地有二千多亩，既扩大了耕地面积，又获得了蔬菜丰收；第二年，社员们看到了平整土地的好处，因此鼓起更大干劲，又将四千多亩高低不平的土地改变成方方整整的园田。
    水利工程大规模地兴建起来。在菜区平整的土地上，建设了一条条排灌两用的沟渠，全公社有近二千亩坡地改成了水坑田，使一天也不能缺水的绿叶菜的用水得到了保证。稻区三千多亩的低洼田，也连年发动社员兴修和加固了一万多米的圩岸，增施大量的河泥、垃圾，加以改造。今年以来，公社还在稻区建设了两个电力灌溉站，建筑了八千九百二十米长的渠道，灌溉农田达三千四百多亩。这些工程在今年经受了许多年来少有的旱涝考验，发挥了巨大的作用。7月前后，接连三十天大旱，吴淞江畔三千多亩蔬菜水坑田仍然得到充足的水份。8月上旬，一天雨量达到二百五十毫米，但由于大部分高岗和坡地减低了坡度，修建了沟渠，从高处泻下的水被切断了，流进沟渠，排到河里。联星生产队六百多亩柴荡田淹得只剩稻梢，也因为圩岸修得坚固，公社从各个队里调来了七部抽水机，一天一夜就把积水全部戽到河里。社员们说：“要不是办了人民公社，柴荡田里又是收几根茅柴了。”
    农田建设的另一个重要方面，就是大力增施肥料。公社化以前，棉花、蚕豆不施肥，粮食、蔬菜很少施肥。有相当一部分稻田、麦田，由于离河远，积肥少，经常白地白种，种后又不施追肥，人们称为“吃素田”。公社成立后，全党全民总动员，一面大搞养猪积肥，一面大挖河泥，一面到外地运肥，肥料大大增多。现在，棉田、蚕豆田都施肥，稻田肥料更是逐年增加。据以种稻为主的横河生产队调查，1957年高级社时，每亩稻田施基肥五十担草河泥，1958年施八十担，1959年施一百三十担，今年施肥增加到一百五十担。
    生产连年发展，人民公社公共积累越来越多。积累增多了，就可以用于扩大再生产，购置高级社时无力购置的大中型农业机械，提高农业机械化程度，进一步保障生产的继续跃进。1958年黄渡人民公社成立时，提留了公共积累四十万九千多元，1959年提留公共积累九十万三千多元，比1958年增长一点二倍。现在公社的固定资产已达到一百多万元，比1958年底增长近一倍，平均每户达二百四十多元。两年来，公社先后购置了拖拉机八部，抽水机三十部，汽轮一艘，卡车一辆，建设了电力灌溉站两座，以及数量众多的农船和各种脱粒机、收割机等等。
            大兴协作　人尽其才
    黄渡人民公社各种作物全面大增产，又是人民公社在更大范围内统一使用劳动力的结果。
    大协作是解决劳动力不足的关键之一。这里的稻区面积大，劳动力少，有些队一个劳动力要负担五亩半田的耕种任务。麦收以后，挑肥、犁地、移栽，许多农活集中在一起，尤为紧张。菜区终年是收、管、种三件大事，到了春菜播种和秋菜播种时，要整地、播种，又要浇水，有时安排不过来，只得眼巴巴地看着土地荒掉。在高级社时，无论粮农、菜农，大家各搞各的活，互不照应，结果产量都受到影响。人民公社成立后，这个矛盾获得了解决。黄渡人民公社根据稻菜收种的不同季节，统筹安排了全公社劳动力，本着等价交换的原则，组织了各个生产队的劳动力大协作。每逢水稻和油菜移栽季节，菜区各个生产队组织劳动力支援稻区；当菜区生产进入紧要关头，粮区各个生产队也主动组织劳力畜力支援菜区。两年来，相互支援的劳动日达一万三千五百多个。这种大协作，有效地解决了农忙期间劳动力不足的问题。高级社时，水稻插秧往往拖到小暑，油菜移栽要拖到小雪。1959年，顾家、老宅等产粮队，一般都在夏至后一两天就结束插秧，油菜移栽在立冬以后两三天就完成了。今年由于协作双方都派出“精兵”，更以认真负责的态度，不完成任务不回队，基本上做到水稻插秧不过夏至关，抢上了季节。
    随着生产的发展，劳动力需要量大大增加，人民公社大量兴办了集体福利事业，为增加劳动力提供了一个重要来源。两年来，黄渡人民公社兴办了各种集体福利事业以后，使占全公社劳动力60％的女社员，从繁琐的家务劳动中解放出来，她们全心全意地参加生产，从而组成了一支庞大的产业军。许家生产队三十五岁的女社员张阿妹，是一个有八个孩子的妈妈，烧饭、洗衣、带孩子等家务劳动的担子压得她透不过气来。人民公社成立以后，吃饭进食堂，孩子进了托儿所、幼儿园，洗衣服有洗衣组，倒马桶有清洁组，她一门心思参加生产，心情舒畅，干劲十足，今年她和其他社员一起在四亩洼地种了油菜试验田，获得了比好田还高的产量。
    在各项生产建设事业中，黄渡人民公社不仅在更大范围内统一使用劳动力，而且注意合理安排劳动力，既从生产需要出发，又照顾各个社员的不同情况，发挥他们的特长，做到人尽其才，各得其所。比如，青年人闯劲最足，各个生产队都组织了青年突击队，专门攻难关，打冲锋；在大田生产时，组织心细肯钻的女社员治虫、整地；老年社员虽然体力较弱，但种田有经验，就由他们负责望田头、看管仓库、管理“十边”隙地的生产；善于主持家务的妇女，则分配她们担任炊事员、保育员和教养员。这样分工协作，既保证了各项事业大发展的需要，也进一步调动了社员的积极性。
            增产商品　支援国家
    人民公社的集中大生产，使商品生产不断发展，商品率不断提高。以油菜、肉猪、水产等几项主要产品为例：油菜籽1958年出售四千七百二十八担，比1957年增加1.5％，商品率99.5％；1959年出售量又比1958年增加127.4％，商品率99.7％；今年比去年又增加10.6％，商品率99.7％。肉猪1958年上市量二千四百头，比1957年增加31.9％，商品率87.2％；1959年上市量比1958年又增加14.9％，商品率91.5％；今年上半年比去年同期又增加65.9％，商品率94.6％。
    商品生产的发展不仅表现在数量的增长和商品率提高方面，还表现在品种增加和质量提高以及均衡供应等方面。以泥岗生产队蔬菜生产为例：这个生产队1958年上市蔬菜有六十七个花色品种，1959年增加到一百二十一个，今年到现在又增加到一百九十三个。淡季供应情况也得到逐年改善。
    人民公社商品生产的发展，有力地支援了国家建设和城市的副食品供应，同时也给公社增加了大量现金收入，以换回生产资料和生活资料。这就进一步密切了城乡关系，加强了工农联盟，改善了农民生活。
                            ＊ ＊ ＊
    随着生产的迅速发展，黄渡公社社员的生活水平也不断提高。1959年，全公社按人口平均每一个人的收入达到一百一十九元。在黄渡地区来说，这是一件了不起的大事。据调查：过去五口之家的富裕中农，在稻区一年的收入平均不过四百元左右，平均每个人八十元上下，其中吃掉二百元，还有二百元用于穿着日用；种菜多的富裕中农收入高一点，也只有五百元左右。现在，社员的生活已经超过这个水平了。
    黄渡人民公社两年来所取得的成就，是和党的正确领导分不开的。这个公社的党组织在市委和县委的领导下，认真贯彻党的方针政策，积极领导群众为办好人民公社而奋斗。经过两年时间的考验，党的领导越来越坚强，干部和积极分子的队伍越来越扩大，以贫农和下中农为骨干的社员群众，越来越紧密地团结在党的周围，他们把人民公社看作共同幸福的泉源，把一切美好的希望寄托在人民公社。
    在未来的岁月里，黄渡人民公社的社员们，一定会更高地举起总路线、大跃进和人民公社的红旗，发愤图强，进一步发挥人民公社的巨大威力，高速度地发展生产，创造更美好更幸福的生活。（附图片）
