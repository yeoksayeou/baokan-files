Promoting Good Experiences in Transforming Railway Station Yards

In the movement to increase production and practice economy, all sectors are tapping potential. The transportation sector also has many ways to tap potential, and one effective method is to carry out overall transformation of railway station yards. The benefits of this method have been strongly proven in the Fuxin and Hegang mining areas, and in the two major cities of Tianjin and Harbin.

What is the overall transformation of station yards? It involves unified arrangement, comprehensive planning, and gradual transformation of railway hubs and stations' yards, lines, loading and unloading, storage, and other related transportation equipment, in order to achieve rational layout and increase transport capacity. How great are its benefits? In the industrial and mining areas, take Fuxin as an example: After the completion of the first phase of the overall transformation project, the line throughput capacity of Fuxin Station increased from 1,000 cars to 2,200 cars. The average vehicle dwell time throughout last year was 6.9 hours, which was reduced to an average of 5.2 hours in the first half of this year. After all projects are completed, the line throughput capacity can be greatly increased, the vehicle dwell time can be shortened much more, and three to five locomotives can be saved. In large cities, take Tianjin as an example: After the completion of the first phase of the overall transformation of railway freight yards and dedicated lines in the city, the conditions for direct entry and exit of trains have improved, greatly speeding up vehicle turnaround time. The vehicle dwell time at Tianjin Station has been shortened from 11 or 12 hours to about 6 hours. After the transformation of 95 dedicated lines in the city, the loading and unloading capacity can be increased by about one time.

Why does the station yard transformation increase such a large transport capacity? Because the overall transformation of station yards reflects a further improvement in the relations of production, thereby promoting the development of productive forces. It once again reflects the superiority of the socialist system. A certain station yard configuration reflects a certain relationship of production. Under the capitalist system, due to the private ownership of the means of production and the anarchy of production, a reasonable station yard configuration is impossible. For example, in the past, in some large coal mining areas, the coal system had its own set of station yard equipment, and the railway system also had a set of equipment serving coal mine transportation. Each family acted independently, divided and fragmented, with many barriers, mutual involvement, which not only wasted a lot of transportation equipment, but also seriously affected the improvement of transportation efficiency and the timely and rapid transportation of goods. Under the socialist system, the public ownership of the means of production provides us with the possibility of fundamentally eliminating unreasonable layouts of production equipment.

Since the Great Leap Forward, the communist style of cooperation has been greatly developed, and the relations of production have been continuously improved. Therefore, many new things that promote the development of productive forces have emerged in various aspects. Cooperative power supply is one example, the organization of automobiles of organs and enterprises for collaborative public use is one example, and the overall transformation of railway station yards is another example. The overall transformation of station yards enables our roads and mines to develop from ideological unity (political command, communist ideology closely uniting them) and organizational collaboration (implementing the "one-dragon" large-scale collaboration of production, transportation, and sales) to large-scale collaboration in the configuration of transportation equipment, fundamentally changing the unreasonable state of station yard layout.

The overall transformation of railway station yards is also an important aspect of the technical revolution in China's railway sector. It marks that the technical innovation and technical revolution of railway station yards have moved from general, scattered, and partial reforms to a new stage of systematic, comprehensive, and planned overall transformation of transportation equipment. This is also a revolution that fundamentally changes the backward state of transportation in factories and mining enterprises, which not only plays a huge role in increasing production and practicing economy in railway transportation, but also has extremely significant significance for ensuring the smooth development of the movement to increase production and practice economy centered on grain and steel, and further meeting the needs of the continuous leap forward of industrial and agricultural production for transportation. Therefore, factories, mining enterprises, and cities that have already begun the overall transformation of railway station yards should fully mobilize the masses, concentrate on one key point for a period of time, use the method of fighting annihilation battles, and accelerate the progress of the transformation project. Those factories, mining enterprises, and cities that have not yet carried out the overall transformation of station yards but objectively need to do so should actively prepare, formulate an overall transformation plan according to needs and possibilities, and carry out this work once the timing is right and preparations are mature.

Some people think that the overall transformation of railway station yards is only a matter for the railway sector. This view is incorrect. On the one hand, this overall transformation is carried out according to the needs of production. It involves various production departments, and some project items require the joint determination and completion of the transportation department and the production department. On the other hand, many industrial and mining enterprises have their own dedicated lines and transportation equipment, and some large enterprises also have their own railway transportation systems. They are interconnected, interdependent, mutually influential, and mutually restrictive with the railway department, forming a unified whole. Therefore, the overall transformation of railway station yards includes the corresponding transformation of industrial and mining enterprises that are related to railway transportation and that own railway transportation equipment. Perhaps some people worry that the overall transformation may affect production. Will the overall transformation delay production for enterprises? We say that if there is no plan, or if the arrangement is improper (including the arrangement of labor, the allocation of materials, and the determination of time), it will affect production. However, carrying out the work in stages with preparation and planning will not only not hinder production, but on the contrary, will promote the leap forward of production. For example, Fuxin Coal Mine and the railway department jointly carried out the overall transformation of the station yard, which not only greatly shortened the station dwell time of vehicles, but also increased the coal storage capacity of Fuxin Coal Mine by eighty times, making it possible to "produce even if no vehicles come for three days, and load vehicles as usual even if no production occurs for three days," effectively ensuring the continuous leap forward of coal production. The production department should regard the overall transformation of railway station yards as its own responsibility, and regard it as a key to the continuous leap forward of production, and work with the railway department to do this work well.

Perhaps some comrades feel that since it is an overall transformation, the state must invest a lot, add a lot of equipment, and supply a lot of materials. In fact, this is not the case. When Fuxin, Hegang, Tianjin, and Harbin carried out the overall transformation of station yards, the state did not invest or invested very little, and some equipment and raw materials were solved by their own efforts. The overall transformation of railway station yards does not mean that the old things are all abandoned and completely replaced with new ones, but first of all, it requires changing the unreasonable situation in the layout of the original station yard equipment, and fully mobilizing some "useless" or "underutilized" equipment, turning it into "useful" or "fully utilized," and carrying out new construction on the basis of utilizing the old. For example, in the overall transformation of dedicated lines in nine cities in Heilongjiang Province, the lines that were lengthened and newly built were all carried out by dismantling the original unreasonably laid out lines. Without increasing any rails, 1,500 cargo spaces were added. All our construction undertakings must be done in a fast and economical manner. The overall transformation of railway station yards is no exception. Implementing the policy of self-reliance and combining indigenous and foreign methods, and adopting the methods of turning idle into busy and making do with whatever is available are the most practical and basic methods for the overall transformation of railway station yards. By following this method, the overall transformation can be carried out in a faster, better, and more economical manner.

Is the experience of the overall transformation of railway station yards only applicable to the railway system, and not applicable to the highway and waterway transportation systems? Is it only large factories and mines and large cities that need to carry out this work, and small and medium-sized factories and mines and small and medium-sized cities do not need to carry out this work? Neither is true. Highway and waterway transportation systems and small and medium-sized cities and small and medium-sized enterprises can also promote the experience of overall transformation of railway station yards according to actual conditions and local conditions. Under the unified leadership of the municipal party committee, Panlongba Station and Port in Neijiang City, Sichuan Province, together with fifteen units from nearby factories and enterprises, combined the transportation innovation plan with the urban construction plan; combined solving the current production key with the long-term plan to fundamentally change the face; combined long-distance and short-distance transportation, carried out comprehensive planning and overall transformation, and quickly changed the backward state of the station and port, greatly improving transportation and loading and unloading capacity. This shows that the experience of the overall transformation of railway station yards has universal significance. In order to further tap the potential of transportation, promote the further development of the movement to increase production and practice economy centered on grain and steel, and ensure a better continuous leap forward in industrial and agricultural production, promoting the experience of the overall transformation of railway station yards is an important measure, and we should earnestly do this work well.

    推广改造铁路站场的好经验
    在增产节约运动中，各行各业都在挖掘潜力。交通运输部门挖掘潜力的办法也很多，其中有效的办法之一，是对铁路站场进行总体改造。这个办法的好处，在阜新、鹤岗两矿区、天津、哈尔滨两个大城市都得到了有力的证明。
    什么叫站场的总体改造？就是对铁路枢纽和车站的站场、线路、装卸、储存以及其他有关的运输设备，进行统一安排，综合规划，逐步改造，以达到合理布局，增加运力的目的。它的好处究竟有多大呢？在工矿区以阜新为例：总体改造第一期工程完成后，阜新车站的线路通过能力，由一千车提高到两千二百车，车辆停留时间去年全年平均为六点九小时，今年上半年缩短到平均五点二小时；待各项工程全部竣工后，线路通过能力还可大大提高，车辆停留时间还能缩短很多，并可节省三至五台机车。在大城市，以天津为例：全市的铁路货场与专用线进行总体改造的第一期工程完成后，列车直出直入的条件更好了，大大加快了车辆周转时间，天津站车辆停站时间由十一、二小时缩短到六小时左右，全市九十五条专用线经过改造后，可以使装卸能力提高一倍左右。
    为什么站场一经改造就增加这么大的运力呢？因为站场总体改造反映了生产关系进一步完善了，因而促进了生产力的发展。它又一次反映了社会主义制度的优越性。一定的站场配置，反映了一定的生产关系。在资本主义制度下，由于生产资料的私人占有和生产的无政府状态，根本不可能有合理的站场配置。例如过去在一些大煤矿所在地区，煤炭系统有自己的一套站场设备，铁路系统也有一套为煤矿运输服务的设备，一家一户，分散割裂，关口重重，互相牵扯，不仅浪费了大量的运输设备，而且严重地影响了运输效率的提高和货物的及时迅速的运输。在社会主义制度下，生产资料的全民所有制，为我们提供了从根本上排除生产设备布局不合理的可能性。
    大跃进以来，共产主义协作风格大大发扬，生产关系得到不断改进，因而各方面出现了许多促进生产力发展的新生事物。合作化供用电是一例，机关企业的汽车组织起来协作公用是一例，铁路站场总体改造又是一例。站场总体改造，使我们路矿之间由思想上的统一（政治挂帅、共产主义思想把它们紧紧结合在一起）、组织上的协作（实行产运销“一条龙”大协作），发展到运输设备配置上的大协作，根本改变了站场布局上的不合理状态。
    铁路站场总体改造也是我国铁路部门技术革命的一个重要方面，它标志着铁路站场的技术革新和技术革命已经从一般的、零散的、局部的改革，进入到系统的、全面的、有计划的运输设备总体改造的新阶段。这也是从根本上改变厂矿企业运输落后面貌的一次革命，不仅对于铁路运输的增产节约起着巨大的作用，对于保证以粮钢为中心的增产节约运动的顺利开展，进一步满足工农业生产持续跃进对于运输的需要，也是具有极其重大的意义的。所以，已经开始进行铁路站场总体改造的厂矿企业和城市，要把群众充分发动起来，一个时期集中一个重点，用打歼灭战的方法，加速改造工程的进程；那些尚未进行站场总体改造、而客观上又需要进行的厂矿企业和城市，要积极进行准备，根据需要与可能，拟定总体改造方案，一俟时机得当、准备成熟，便进行这一工作。
    有人以为铁路站场总体改造，只是铁路部门的事。这种看法是不正确的。一方面，这次总体改造是运输根据生产的需要进行的，它牵涉到各生产部门，而且有些工程项目需要运输部门和生产部门共同确定，共同完成；另一方面，很多工矿企业都有自己的专用线和运输设备，一些大企业还有自己的铁路运输系统，它们与铁路部门互相联系、互相依赖、互相影响、互相制约，构成一个统一的整体。因此，铁路站场总体改造，便包括着与铁路运输有关的、以及拥有铁路运输设备的工矿企业也要进行相应的改造。也许有人担心总体改造可能影响生产。对企业来说，总体改造会不会耽误生产呢？我们说，如果没有计划，或者安排不当（包括劳动力的安排、材料的分配和时间的确定），是会影响生产的。但是有准备、有计划地分期进行，不仅不会妨碍生产，恰恰相反，会促进生产的跃进。例如阜新煤矿与铁路部门一起进行站场总体改造，不仅大大缩短了车辆的站停时间，阜新煤矿的贮煤能力提高了八十倍，可以做到“三天不来车也能生产，三天不生产照常装车”，有力地保证了煤炭生产的持续跃进。生产部门应当把铁路站场总体改造看成自己份内之事，并把它作为生产持续跃进的一个关键，与铁路部门一起把这一工作做好。
    也许有些同志觉得既然是总体改造，国家就非得大量投资不可，就非得大量添置设备不可，就非得大量供给材料不可。其实，事情并不是这样，阜新、鹤岗、天津、哈尔滨市在进行站场总体改造时，国家并没有投资或投资很少，一些设备和原材料都是依靠自己动手解决的。铁路站场总体改造，并不是把旧的东西都不要了，完全以新代旧，而首先是要求改变原有站场设备布置上的不合理状况，把一些“无用”或“利用不充分”的设备充分动员起来，变成“有用”或“充分地利用”，在利用旧的基础上进行新的建设。例如：黑龙江省九个市在专用线总体改造中补长和新建的线路，都是用拆除原来布置不合理的线路进行的，没有增加什么钢轨就增加货位一千五百个。我们的一切建设事业既要多快，又要好省，铁路站场总体改造也不例外。贯彻自己动手、土洋结合的方针，采用变闲为忙、因陋就简的方法，才是铁路站场总体改造最实际、最基本的方法，按着这个方法做，总体改造就可能多快好省地进行。
    是不是铁路站场总体改造的经验，仅仅适用于铁路系统，而不适用于公路、水路运输系统呢？是不是只是大厂矿和大城市要进行这一工作，而中小厂矿和中小城市就不需要进行这一工作呢？都不是。公路、水运系统和中小城市、中小企业，也可以根据实际情况，因地制宜地推广铁路站场总体改造的经验。四川省内江市蟠龙坝车站和港口，在市委的统一领导下，与附进一带的工厂、企业十五个单位一起，把交通运输的革新规划和城市建设规划结合起来；把解决当前生产关键和根本改变面貌的长远规划结合起来；把长途和短途运输结合起来，进行全面规划，总体改造，迅速改变了车站、港口的落后面貌，大大提高了运输、装卸能力。这说明铁路站场总体改造的经验是有普遍意义的。为了进一步挖掘运输的潜力，促进以粮钢为中心的增产节约运动进一步开展起来，保证工农业生产更好的持续跃进，推行铁路站场总体改造经验，是一项重要措施，我们应切实地把这项工作做好。
