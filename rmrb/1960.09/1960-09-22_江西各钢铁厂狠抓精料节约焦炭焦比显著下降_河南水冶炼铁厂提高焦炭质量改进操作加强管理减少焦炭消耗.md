Xinhua News Agency, Nanchang, September 21st: Workers in Jiangxi's small-scale iron and steel enterprises are focusing on the fine materials link, vigorously reducing the coke ratio, and ensuring that the least amount of coke is used to refine more and better pig iron to support Shanghai's steel production. Workers in each factory launched a competition centered on this in September. So far, the coke ratios of iron and steel plants in Pingxiang, Yingtan, Dongxiang, and Anfu have all decreased significantly, and the utilization coefficient of blast furnaces and the quality of pig iron have greatly improved. The average comprehensive coke ratio of Pingxiang Iron and Steel Plant decreased to 1.34, and the average coke ratio of No. 1 furnace dropped to a minimum of 0.55. The coke ratios of Dongxiang, Yingtan, and other iron and steel plants are also between 0.8 and 1.

      Adhering to the policy of fine materials, large air volume, and high temperature, and focusing on the central link of fine materials, is the main measure for workers in Jiangxi's small-scale iron and steel enterprises to save coal and coke, reduce the coke ratio, and use the least amount of coal to produce more pig iron. Each factory has mobilized the masses to summarize and promote advanced experience, formulated plans and measures to grasp fine materials and reduce the coke ratio, and insisted that raw coal is not washed, ore is not roasted, and is not graded before it enters the furnace, ensuring that the blast furnace eats fine grains. Workers in the smelting and coking workshops of Pingxiang Iron and Steel Plant enthusiastically launched the "Three Nos, Two Goods, and One Correct" competition, with the content being: no waste rock, no large pieces of ore, no powder; good washing and selection, good roasting; correct weighing and charging. During the competition, when there were not enough coal washing troughs, the workers washed them by hand with wooden buckets; when roasting could not keep up, old coke ovens were used for roasting. Because the blast furnace eats fine materials and fine grains, the furnace conditions are getting smoother and smoother. In early September, the average comprehensive coke ratio of the plant decreased to 1.34, of which the coke ratio of No. 1 and No. 5 furnaces remained stable between 0.8 and 1, thus saving coke and increasing the output and quality of pig iron. The workers of Dongxiang Iron and Steel Plant resolutely implemented a three-shift unified operation, and raw materials and fuels were charged into the furnace in three levels, so the output increased step by step, and the coke ratio decreased greatly. In early September, the average daily output of the plant increased by 7% compared with August, and the average coke ratio was about 1.5.

      While grasping fine materials, the workers of each iron and steel plant insisted on large air volume and high temperature operation of blast furnaces. In order to improve the blast temperature and pressure, the Party committee secretary of Dongxiang Iron and Steel Plant personally experimented on the No. 2 blast furnace, and together with the workers, transformed the hot blast system, so that the utilization coefficient quickly reached 1.5, and the coke ratio dropped to 0.96.

      Workers in various iron and steel enterprises have also tried their best to improve the coking rate, use low-quality coal and anthracite to make coke, and save more main coking coal to support key iron and steel plants. In the past, Ganzhong Iron and Steel Plant mainly used the main coking coal of Pingxiang Coal Mine for coking. In order to support the Wuhan Iron and Steel Corporation with more good coking coal, the workers of this plant carried out technical innovations and created a round coking furnace that can refine 60 to 100 tons of coke, using low-quality coal mixed with 10% coke breeze for coking, with a coking rate as high as 70.71%. After adopting this method, they not only saved the main coking coal, but also ensured the needs of the blast furnace. Workers in Pingxiang, Dongxiang, Yingtan and other iron and steel plants used Sichuan Maoershan round coking furnaces, mixed 20% of coke breeze, coal powder and anthracite into fine coal for coking, and the coking rate was also above 70%. The workers of Xinfeng Iron and Steel Plant made coal bricks from anthracite and used brick and tile kilns for coking, so that no main coking coal was used for coking.

      Various places have also strengthened the management of raw materials and fuels, and tried to reduce losses from loading and transportation to entering the furnace, so that every piece of coke can contribute to ironmaking.

      According to our newspaper, the workers of Henan Shuiye Iron Smelting Plant have tried every means to reduce coke consumption in the production process. In the first eight months of this year, the average coke consumption per ton of iron dropped to 1.28 tons, and more than 10,800 tons of coke were saved by fully utilizing coke powder.

      The Party committee of this plant has always adhered to the principle of diligence and frugality in running the enterprise, continuously educated the workers on saving coke, and adopted effective measures to reduce the coke ratio. They have cultivated the idea of using less coke to produce more iron and produce good iron by organizing workers to calculate detailed accounts and conducting a debate on how to reduce the coke ratio. Grasp every link of coal washing and coking to improve the quality of coke and create conditions for saving coke. In terms of coking production, we conscientiously promoted the advanced operating experience of "skillful batching, hot charging, fine adjustment, and rapid refining," shortened the coking time, and improved the quality of coke, so that the ash content of coke was reduced from 30% to 20% to 15%. In terms of blast furnace production, we focused on technical operations and conscientiously implemented the advanced experience of "large air volume, high temperature, and fine materials." Since the beginning of this year, the No. 2 secretary experimental furnace has reduced the coke ratio to 0.95 due to the increased blast temperature.

      In terms of coke management, this factory implemented a management system of dividing areas, storing good coke, inferior coke, and local coke separately, and strictly controlling the crushing particle size, sieving and grading before entering the furnace, so as to make unified planning and rational use of coke, and to ensure that neither good coke nor inferior coke is wasted. The coke powder remaining after crushing is partially sintered for ironmaking, and the rest is mixed in coking coal for recoking. (Attached picture)

　　江西各钢铁厂狠抓精料节约焦炭焦比显著下降
　　河南水冶炼铁厂提高焦炭质量改进操作加强管理减少焦炭消耗
    据新华社南昌21日电　江西小洋群钢铁企业职工狠抓精料环节，大力降低焦比，保证用最少的焦炭炼出更多更好的生铁来支援上海炼钢生产。各厂职工以此为中心，在9月份开展了竞赛。到目前止，萍乡、鹰潭、东乡、安福等钢铁厂的焦比都显著下降，高炉利用系数、生铁质量都有较大的提高。萍乡钢铁厂月平均综合焦比降到一点三四，一号炉平均焦比最低降到了零点五五。东乡、鹰潭等钢铁厂的焦比也都在零点八到一之间。
    坚持精料、大风、高温的方针，狠抓精料这一中心环节，是江西小洋群钢铁企业职工节约煤焦，降低焦比，用最少的煤炼出更多的生铁的主要措施。各厂都发动群众总结推广先进经验，制订了抓精料、降低焦比的计划和措施，坚持原煤不洗、矿石不焙烧、不分级，就不入炉，保证高炉吃细粮。萍乡钢铁厂冶炼、焦化车间职工热烈展开“三无两好一不错”竞赛，内容是：无废石，无大块矿石，无粉末；洗选好，焙烧好；过磅上料不错。在竞赛中洗煤槽不够用，职工们就用木桶手洗；焙烧跟不上，就用旧焦炉焙。由于高炉吃精料细粮，炉况越来越顺。9月上旬，全厂平均综合焦比降低到一点三四，其中一号和五号炉的焦比始终稳定在零点八到一之间，因而节约了焦炭，提高了生铁的产量和质量。东乡钢铁厂的职工们坚决实行了三班统一操作，原料燃料分三级入炉，因此产量步步上升，焦比大大下降，全厂9月上旬日产量平均比8月提高7％，焦比平均在一点五左右。
    各钢铁厂职工在抓精料的同时，坚持高炉大风、高温操作。东乡钢铁厂为了提高风温、风压，党委书记亲自在二号高炉试验，同工人一道改造了热风系统，使利用系数迅速达到一点五，焦比降到零点九六。
    各钢铁企业职工还千方百计地提高结焦率，利用低质煤、无烟煤炼焦，节约更多的主焦煤支援重点钢铁厂。赣中钢铁厂过去主要用萍乡煤矿的主焦煤炼焦。为了以更多的好焦煤支援武钢，这个厂的职工大搞技术革新，创造了一种可炼六十到一百吨焦的圆型炼焦炉，以低质煤掺用10％的焦末炼焦，结焦率高达70.71％。他们采用这一办法后，既节省了主焦煤，又保证了高炉的需要。萍乡、东乡、鹰潭等钢铁厂职工采用四川茅儿山圆型炼焦炉，在精煤中掺用20％的焦末、煤粉、无烟煤炼焦，结焦率也都在70％以上。信丰钢铁厂的职工用无烟煤做成煤砖，利用砖瓦窑炼焦，做到了炼焦不用主焦煤。
    各地还加强了原料燃料的管理，从装运到入炉，尽量减少损耗，使每一块焦都为炼铁出力。
    本报讯　河南省水冶炼铁厂职工千方百计减少生产过程中的焦炭消耗。今年前八个月每吨铁耗焦量平均下降到一点二八吨，加上充分利用焦粉，共节约焦炭一万零八百多吨。
    这个厂的党委一直坚持勤俭办企业的方针，不断向职工进行节约用焦的教育，采取有效措施降低焦比。他们通过组织职工算细账，开展如何降低焦比的鸣放辩论，树立了少用焦、多产铁、产好铁的思想。抓紧洗煤、炼焦的各个环节来提高焦炭质量，为节约用焦创造条件。在炼焦生产方面，认真推广“巧配、热装、细调、快炼”的先进操作经验，缩短结焦时间，提高焦炭质量，使焦炭含灰分由30％降低到20％到15％，在高炉生产方面，狠抓技术操作，认真贯彻“大风、高温、精料”的先进经验。今年以来，二号书记试验炉由于提高了风温，焦比下降为零点九五。
    在焦炭管理方面，这个厂实行了划分区域，好焦、劣焦、土焦分别存放的管理制度，并严格破碎粒度，过筛分级入炉，做到统一规划，合理使用焦炭，做到好焦、劣焦都不浪费。破碎余下的焦粉，一部分烧结后炼铁，其余掺在焦煤中重新炼焦。（附图片）
