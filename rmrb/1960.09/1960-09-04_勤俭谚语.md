Proverbs on Thrift and Diligence

　　Good production is like a money tree, thrift is like a cornucopia.
　　Always think of lean days when you have plenty, don't wait until you have nothing to think of having something.
　　Live as if it were a lean year even in a bumper year, and always think of having no grain when you have grain.
　　A long journey starts with a short step, and great things start with small things.
　　Save a mouthful each meal, and you'll save several pecks a year.
　　Save a mouthful when you have plenty, and it will be worth a peck when you have nothing.
　　If you know how to work and how to calculate, you will never run out of money and grain; if you practice frugality, you will never worry about food and clothing.
　　Don't waste money, save it for the country.
　　Building a family is like picking soil with a needle, but ruining it is like water pushing sand.
　　Even with ten thousand bushels of grain, one should still eat simple meals.

专栏：勤俭谚语

    勤俭谚语生产好比摇钱树，节约好似聚宝盆。常将有日思无日，莫到无时想有时。丰年要当歉年过，有粮常想无粮时。远路要从近处走，大事要从小处着手。一顿省一口，一年省几斗。有时省一口，无时当一斗。会打会算，钱粮不断，细水长流，吃穿不愁。有钱莫乱花，储蓄爱国家。兴家犹如针挑土，败家犹如水推沙。粮收万石，也要粗茶淡饭。
