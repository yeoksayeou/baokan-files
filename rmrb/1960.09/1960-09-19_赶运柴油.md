　　Rushing Diesel Fuel
　　Darkness was falling when the telephone rang in the office of the Shuoli store in Xiao County, Anhui. Xu Jingxiang, the branch secretary, picked up the receiver and heard an urgent voice say, "The diesel engine in the Shenji high-yield rice paddy in Shuoli Commune is out of diesel... Hundreds of mu of rice are waiting for irrigation, please help us solve this problem quickly." Secretary Xu knew that the store did not have any diesel at the time, but after considering it, he gave the other party a definite answer: "Okay, we will definitely help solve it immediately." He put down the receiver and discussed it with everyone, deciding to send salesman Old Wang to the county commercial bureau wholesale station to find a way.
　　It was almost midnight when salesman Old Wang called from Yanglou: "Diesel has been bought, please send a vehicle to transport it back quickly." Xu Jingxiang ran to the transportation station, but unfortunately, all the vehicles had already left. He rushed to the production materials department and woke up salesman Xiao Liang. The two of them pulled a flatbed cart and rushed to Yanglou overnight to transport the diesel.
　　From Shuoli to Yanglou, there were more than sixty li, with several rivers in between. After more than four hours of rapid travel, they arrived just as dawn was breaking. The wholesale station had already prepared the diesel and helped load it onto the cart. The two of them, regardless of their fatigue, ate something and hurried back. At noon, when the commune members were eagerly waiting for the store to deliver the diesel, Secretary Xu and the others arrived, pulling the cart. The commune members said gratefully: "You come whenever we need you, you are truly our good 'logistics department'!"

    赶运柴油
    天快黑了，安徽萧县朔里商店办公室的电话铃响起来。支部书记许敬香拿起耳机，只听对方急声地说：“朔里公社沈集丰产稻田的柴油机没有柴油了……现在几百亩稻子等着灌溉，请商店里赶快帮助解决。”许书记明知商店里当时没有柴油，可是他考虑了一下，还是向对方作了肯定的回答：“好，我们一定马上帮助解决。”他放下耳机和大家商量了一下，决定派营业员老王到县商业局批发站去想办法。
    快到夜间十二点钟了，营业员老王从杨楼摇来电话：“柴油已买到，请速派车运回。”许敬香跑到搬运站，不巧，车子都出发了。他连忙赶到生产资料门市部，叫起营业员小梁，两人拉着一辆平车，连夜到杨楼去运柴油。
    从朔里到杨楼，有六十多里，中途还隔着几道河。经过四个多小时的急行，天刚蒙蒙亮，就赶到了。批发站早已把柴油准备好，又帮助装上车子。两人顾不得疲劳，吃了点饭就往回急赶。中午，社员们正在盼望着商店送来柴油的时候，许书记等拉着车子赶到了。社员们感激地说：“随要随到，真是我们的好‘后勤部’！”
