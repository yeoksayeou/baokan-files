Xinhua News Agency, Budapest: With the rapid development of the agricultural cooperative movement, the cultural life of Hungarian peasants is becoming increasingly rich.

　　At present, almost all agricultural production cooperatives have started night schools. In Solnok County alone, nearly a thousand members have completed middle school in night schools. State-owned farms and cooperatives have also held various professional training courses, such as raising livestock, cultivating crops, managing horticulture, and operating machinery. At the Baba Tractor Operator Professional School in Vesprem County, more than four thousand members have graduated as excellent tractor operators since the end of last year.

　　The amount of books purchased in rural areas has greatly increased. Before last year, book purchases in rural areas accounted for only 4% of the national total, but last year it jumped to 22%. During the National Book Week held in early June this year, peasant book purchases increased by another 38% compared to last year. Farmers in Chonggrad County purchased more than 10,000 books during this year's Book Week. Since the beginning of this year, farmers in Chonggrad County have purchased books worth more than 2 million forints.

　　Now almost every agricultural production cooperative has its own library and cultural palace. Even in small villages with less than a thousand people, more than 94% have libraries. The number of cooperative members entering libraries increased by 20% last year compared to 1958.

　　The Association for the Popularization of Social and Natural Sciences has done a lot of work in improving the scientific knowledge of working farmers. The number of lectures held by this association in rural areas accounts for about one-half of all lectures.

　　Because the lectures are combined with film slides and other tools to make them easy to understand, they are very popular among farmers. In Vash County, more than 1,000 reports or "popular science evenings" of this nature have been held since the beginning of this year, with more than 70,000 listeners.

　　Rural cultural and recreational life is also becoming increasingly active. Many rural areas have built new cinemas. In villages without cinemas, film projection teams often go to the countryside to perform tours. As a result, the number of people watching movies in rural areas has greatly increased. In the first half of this year, the number of people watching movies in production cooperatives in Komarom County increased by more than 100,000 compared to the same period last year. More than 1,000 literary and art work groups from state-owned farms, machine stations, and enterprises affiliated with the Ministry of Agriculture also often perform in various places, promoting the development of cooperative cultural and recreational activities.

Xinhua News Agency, Sofia: According to the Bulgarian News Agency, the number of doctors in rural Bulgaria is now more than nine times greater than in 1944, totaling 2,800. On average, there is one doctor for every 1,500 rural residents.

　　In the sixteen years since liberation, Bulgaria's rural medical and health services have greatly developed. Taking rural medical institutions as an example, there were only four rural hospitals in the country before liberation in 1939, but now the number of rural medical units has increased to about 2,500. According to the plan, 690 new medical units will be added to the countryside in the near future.

　　In the next two to three years, the number of doctors in rural Bulgaria will increase by about 840. By 1962, the number of beds in rural hospitals and maternity hospitals will be increased by another 1,000.

　　匈牙利农民文化生活日益丰富多彩
　　保加利亚发展农村医疗卫生事业
    据新华社布达佩斯讯　随着农业合作化运动的迅速发展，匈牙利农民的文化生活愈来愈丰富。
    目前各大农业生产合作社差不多都开办了夜校。仅在索尔诺克一州就有近千名社员在夜校读完了中学。国营农场和合作社还举办了各种专业训练班，如饲养牲畜、栽培作物、经管园艺及机器操作等。在维斯普雷姆州的巴巴拖拉机手专业学校，从去年年底到现在已先后有四千多名社员毕业成为优秀的拖拉机手。
    农村的购书额大大增长。去年以前农村购书额只占全国购书量的4％，去年就一跃而为22％。在今年6月初举行的全国图书周期间，农民的购书额又比去年增长了38％。索尔诺克州的农民在今年图书周内共购买了一万多册书。琼格拉德州农民从今年以来已购买了价值二百多万福林的书。
    现在差不多每个农业生产合作社都设有自己的图书馆和文化宫。就连不到一千人的小村，设有图书馆的也已占到94％以上。去年一年内合作社社员进图书馆的人数比1958年增加了20％。
    社会与自然科学普及协会在提高劳动农民的科学知识方面做了不少工作。这个协会在农村举办的讲座次数约占全部讲座的二分之一左右。
    由于配合了电影幻灯片和其他工具来进行讲解，通俗易懂，所以很受农民欢迎。在沃什州今年以来就已举办了一千多次这样性质的报告会或“大众科学晚会”，听众达七万人以上。
    农村的文娱生活也日益活跃起来。不少农村都新建了电影院。在没有电影院的村子经常有放映队下乡去作巡回演出。这样，农村看电影的人数大增。今年上半年科马罗姆州各生产合作社看电影的人数就比去年同期增长了十万多人次。各国营农场、机器站和农业部所属各企业的一千多个文艺工作组也常到各地表演，推动了合作社文娱活动的开展。
    据新华社索非亚讯　据保加利亚通讯社报道：目前保加利亚农村中的医生数目已经比1944年多九倍以上，共达两千八百人。平均每一千五百个农村居民中就有一个医生。
    在解放以来的十六年中，保加利亚的农村医疗卫生事业有了很大的发展。拿农村医疗机构来说，解放前1939年全国只有四个农村医院，而现在农村的医疗单位已经增加到两千五百个左右。根据计划，在不久的将来，农村中还将增加六百九十个新的医疗单位。
    在今后两三年内，保加利亚农村的医生将增加约八百四十人。到1962年，农村医院和产妇院的床位将再增加一千张。
