　　The Vast Expanse of Heaven and Earth
　　Yang Ling

    “All intellectuals who can work in the countryside should be happy to go there. The countryside is a vast expanse of heaven and earth, where they can make a big difference.”
    These are the words added by Comrade Mao Zedong a few years ago to an article in the book "Socialist Upsurge in China's Countryside." These words pointed out a bright path for millions of intellectuals and also inspired millions of people who are working hard to build a new socialist countryside.
    How wide is the "heaven and earth" of the countryside? The harder people work in the countryside, the better they do, the more vast the "heaven and earth" becomes. Here, the breadth and depth are infinite. As for what level each person can reach, it depends on their thinking and their drive.
    When Kong Lingyin of Xian County, Hebei, returned to the countryside and was once somewhat confused, Chairman Mao's words encouraged him and gave him the strength to move forward in this direction. The further he went in this direction, the more he felt that the "heaven and earth" was even more vast. Every time he took a step, and reread Chairman Mao's words, he would feel that the "vast expanse of heaven and earth" spoken of in these words had gained new meaning. Look, haven't he and the youths who fought alongside him become more capable, learned more, broadened their horizons, become more ambitious, and strengthened their will?
    "A shallow pond cannot raise big fish," this was the view of some people when Kong Lingyin first returned to his hometown. His father was also bound by the old ideas imposed on the peasants by the feudal ruling class for thousands of years, believing that once you knew how to read and write, you should no longer be a farmer. His mother and wife also constantly "indirectly" blocked his path. Letters from several classmates also became invisible ropes on his path forward. As a result, he himself also doubted whether there would be any "future" in working in the countryside. If he retreated in this way, the road would become narrower and narrower, he would walk into a dead end, and the "heaven and earth" would become smaller and smaller.
    Kong Lingyin did not let some invisible walls block his way. Chairman Mao's words gave him strength, the Party branch gave him strength, the masses gave him strength, he pushed away all the "walls" and broke all the "ropes"; he made up his mind to work in the countryside, he did whatever farm work was difficult, and he went wherever it was most difficult. He and the "Youth Swift Tiger Team" he participated in launched a major offensive against saline-alkali land, transforming more than 300 mu of heavily alkaline land in two springs. When they were "creating heaven and earth" with their own hands, the "heaven and earth" in their minds also became broader at the same time. "You have to be able to do more work, be a machine hand, an agricultural science researcher, a people's school teacher, and a pig doctor!" This was the expectation of the Party branch secretary for Kong Lingyin, and Kong Lingyin was doing just that. "The able do more work," and "those who work hard become more capable." In labor, the field of knowledge became wider and wider; some of the knowledge learned in school was only understood more deeply and became true knowledge and living knowledge in the process of personally participating in production practice. By contributing everything he had learned and understood to the glorious cause of developing agriculture, this glorious cause also enabled him to learn and understand more and more.
    The laboring people and their production struggles and social struggles are the source of all culture. Today, if one aspires to be a scientific and technological expert, but is unwilling to go among the laboring masses and unwilling to participate in labor production, it is tantamount to being "water without a source, a tree without roots," and there will never be any "achievement," let alone "great achievement." In our society, the doors of any science or literature are first and foremost open to the laboring people. Among the peasant masses in our country, and among the intellectuals who participate in agricultural labor, there are already more and more scientific and technological experts. In today's newspapers, everyone can see the news that thirty-one peasants in Zhejiang Province have become agricultural technicians and engineers; at the same time, one hundred and ninety-six peasants and cadres from peasant backgrounds in Zhejiang have been hired by the Zhejiang Academy of Agricultural Sciences as specially invited researchers. Yang Kuangbao, deputy director of the Huangyan Luqiao Commune, used to be a poor peasant, but now he is a nationally renowned seed expert, serving as the deputy director of the Agronomy Department of Zhejiang Agricultural University and the deputy director of the Crop Breeding and Cultivation Institute of the Zhejiang Academy of Agricultural Sciences. There are many such people in other regions as well. The essence of the issue is not so much about becoming some kind of "expert," some kind of "master," or some kind of "director," but rather that they have opened up a broader expanse of heaven and earth in their march towards nature, and have made important contributions to the socialist cause of the Party and the people.
    "The countryside is a vast expanse of heaven and earth," this sentence can only be truly understood by those who embrace the great ambition of "fighting with the heavens is endless joy! Fighting with the earth is endless joy!" If one ties oneself up with the "fame and fortune" of individualism, then one can only "draw a circle as a prison"; if one sees oneself as a "big fish" that cannot be accommodated in "shallow water," then one can only "sigh at the ocean" in the face of this vast expanse of heaven and earth. As long as one is willing to work hard, has great ambitions, and integrates one's personal destiny with the collective destiny, then in the countryside, there is a bright future in all aspects of politics, economy, science, and culture; strength and knowledge are inexhaustible and inexhaustible there.

### 广阔的天地

　　广阔的天地
　　杨岭
    “一切可以到农村中去工作的这样的知识分子，应当高兴地到那里去。农村是一个广阔的天地，在那里是可以大有作为的。”
    这是毛泽东同志几年前在《中国农村的社会主义高潮》一书中的一篇文章前面加的按语。这些话给千百万知识分子指出了光明大道，也鼓舞了千百万正在艰苦奋斗建设新农村的人们。
    农村的“天地”究竟有多宽阔？在农村里的和到农村去的人们，用劲越大，干得越好，“天地”也就越加广阔。在这里，广度和深度是无限的。至于每个人能达到什么境界，那就决定于他们的思想如何、干劲如何。
    河北献县的孔令印，当他回到农村，一度有些迷惑的时候，毛主席的这段话鼓舞了他，给了他朝着这个方向前进的力量。朝着这个方向，越是向前走，越觉得“天地”更加广阔。每走一段路，再读读毛主席的这段话，都会觉得这段话里说的“广阔的天地”又增添了新的意义。看，他和同他一起奋战的青年们，不是越干、越学习、眼界越宽、雄心越大、意志越坚强吗？
    “水浅养不住大鱼”，这是孔令印刚回到家乡的时候有的人的看法。他的父亲也受着几千年来封建统治阶级加在农民身上的旧思想的束缚，认为识了字、读了书就不该再当庄稼汉。母亲、妻子也不断“转着弯”堵他的路。几个同学的来信也成为他前进道路上的无形的绳索。于是，他自己也怀疑在农村干下去是不是会有“出息”了。如果这样退缩下去，路就会越走越窄，就会走进死胡同，“天地”就会狭小而又狭小了。
    孔令印没有让一些无形的墙挡住去路。毛主席的话给他力量，党支部给他力量，群众给他力量，他推开了一切的“墙”，扭断了一切的“绳索”；他下决心在农村干下去，什么农活困难他就干什么农活，哪里最艰苦他就到哪里去。他和他参加的“青年猛虎突击队”，向盐碱地大举进攻，两个春天就改造了三百多亩重碱地。当他们用自己的双手在“开天辟地”的时候，思想上的“天地”也就同时变得更加广阔了。“你要能者多劳，机器手、农业科学研究员、民校教师、猪医生，都得当啊！”这是党支部书记对孔令印的期望，孔令印也正是这样做的。“能者多劳”，“劳者多能”。在劳动中，知识的领域越来越广；在学校里学过的一些知识，在亲手参加生产实践的过程中才理解得更深，变成了真知识、活知识。把自己学到的、懂得的一切都贡献给了发展农业的光荣事业，这个光荣的事业也就使自己学到的、懂得的越来越多。
    劳动人民和他们的生产斗争、社会斗争，是一切文化的源泉。在今天，如果有志做一个科学技术专家，却不愿意到劳动群众中去，不愿意参加劳动生产，那等于要做“无源之水，无本之木”，是决不会有所“作为”的，更不要说“大有作为”了。在我们的社会里，任何科学、文学的大门首先是为劳动人民大开着。在我国农民群众中，在参加农业劳动的知识分子群众中，已经出现了越来越多的科学技术专家。在今天的报纸上，大家又可以看到浙江省的三十一位农民成为农技师和工程师的消息；同时，浙江又有一百九十六位农民和农民出身的干部被浙江农业科学研究院聘请为特约研究员。黄岩路桥公社副主任杨匡保，过去是个贫苦的农民，现在是全国闻名的种子专家，担任浙江农业大学农学系副主任和浙江省农业科学院作物育种栽培研究所副所长。像这样的人，在别的地区也有不少。问题的本质还不在于成为什么“家”、什么“师”、什么
  “长”，而在于他们在向大自然进军中开辟出来了更广阔的天地，对党和人民的社会主义事业作出了重要的贡献。
    “农村是一个广阔的天地”，这句话，只有抱着“与天奋斗，其乐无穷！与地奋斗，其乐无穷！”的大志的人们，才能真正懂得。如果用个人主义的“名缰利索”把自己拴起来，那就只能“划地为牢”；如果把自己看成“浅水”里容不下的“大鱼”，对这广阔的天地就只能“望洋兴叹”。只要肯艰苦奋斗，有雄心大志，把个人的命运和集体的命运溶化在一起，那末，在农村里，政治、经济、科学、文化，无论哪一方面都有远大的前途；力量、知识，在那里是取之不尽、用之不竭的。
