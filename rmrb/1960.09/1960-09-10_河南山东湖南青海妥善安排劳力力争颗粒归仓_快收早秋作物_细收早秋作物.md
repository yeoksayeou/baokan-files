Xinhua News Agency report: Henan Province is beginning to harvest early autumn grain crops from south to north. Currently, over six million mu of early corn, early rice, and various miscellaneous grain crops have been harvested. Nanyang and Xinyang prefectures, where the season started earlier, have already completed 80% to 90% of their harvest tasks respectively.

In order to achieve timely harvesting and avoid losses, before the harvest, various regions, from the county to the production brigade, universally summarized the experience of careful harvesting from previous years, properly arranged labor, and formed specialized autumn harvest teams for harvesting, transporting, threshing, and storing. At the same time, autumn harvest command posts were established with dedicated personnel to lead the work, ensuring that the autumn harvest work is carried out meticulously and that every grain is brought into the granary.

Harvesting each section as it ripens is an important measure taken by various regions to ensure that no ears or grains are lost. Nanyang, Kaifeng, and other prefectures, aiming at the new characteristics of intercropping and mixed cropping in most early autumn crops, have adopted the methods of harvesting early ripening crops first, harvesting later ripening crops later, harvesting individual ripened plants, harvesting ripened pods, and combining harvesting and protection (protecting unharvested crops), which has greatly reduced the phenomenon of grain loss.

While carefully harvesting and threshing, various regions have also paid special attention to re-harvesting and re-threshing. Shangcheng County organized elderly people and elementary school students to re-harvest more than 18,000 mu of already harvested land, recovering more than 15,000 jin of grain. According to the characteristics of the many types of early autumn crops and different maturity periods, various regions have also strengthened autumn protection work while harvesting.

(Jinan, September 9th) The harvesting of early autumn crops in Shandong has been fully launched. According to statistics on the 6th, the province's harvested area has reached 9,097,000 mu, accounting for more than 66% of the early autumn crop area.

This year's early autumn crop harvesting task in Shandong is extremely heavy. However, due to the implementation of the Party's instructions on vigorously developing agriculture and grain production, from provincial-level agencies to production brigades, from leading cadres to general cadres, they have stepped out of their offices and gone deep into the grassroots, specifically helping production teams organize and plan agricultural work in an organized and planned manner, thereby ensuring both the management of late autumn crops and the smooth progress of early autumn harvesting.

In the autumn harvest, all localities have attached great importance to the work of re-harvesting and re-threshing.

(Changsha, September 9th) In Hunan Province, while rushing to harvest mid-season rice, they have achieved simultaneous harvesting, threshing, carting for drying, and warehousing, and have paid special attention to careful harvesting and threshing, ensuring that every grain is brought into the granary. According to statistics on September 2nd, more than five million mu have already been harvested.

In order to achieve timely harvesting, quick harvesting, and good harvesting, various regions have paid close attention to the rational arrangement of labor from the beginning of the harvest. Based on technical expertise, a reasonable combination of people has been made, so that the five tasks of harvesting, threshing, transporting, drying, and storing are tightly linked, accelerating the progress of harvesting. Chengbu Miao Autonomous County organized more than 14,000 laborers, using more than 3,000 new-style tools such as rice harvesters, threshing machines, and carts, and divided them into various specialized teams for harvesting, transporting, drying, and storing, carrying out a harvesting labor competition. The progress of the county's rush harvest work is very fast and the quality is very good.

(Xining, September 9th) In Qinghai Province, nearly 500,000 laborers have been put into rush harvesting. By September 3rd, more than 45% of the province's wheat crops had been harvested.

The people's communes in the eastern agricultural area started harvesting the earliest. In order to win a complete victory in the wheat harvest, the communes have universally concentrated labor to invest in the autumn harvest. At the same time, they have also extensively carried out cooperation between mountain and plain areas with different maturity periods, vigorously reformed harvesting tools, and carried out high-efficiency competitions to ensure that the wheat harvest work of seizing food from the tiger's mouth is done quickly and carefully. Various people's communes in Datong County concentrated 90% of their labor to harvest autumn crops, launched a competition to harvest one mu per person per day, and one-quarter of the production teams in the county have already averaged more than one mu per person per day, with more than 6,100 harvesting red banner bearers emerging.

    河南山东湖南青海妥善安排劳力力争颗粒归仓
    快收早秋作物　细收早秋作物
    据新华社讯　河南省由南到北开始收割早秋粮食作物。目前，早玉米、早稻和各种杂粮作物已收割六百多万亩。季节较早的南阳、信阳两个专区已经分别完成收割任务的80％到90％以上。
    为了做到适时收割，避免损失，各地在收割之前，从县到生产大队普遍总结了历年来细收细打的经验，妥善地安排了劳力，组成收、运、打、藏的秋收专业队。同时成立了秋收指挥部，固定专人领导，保证秋收工作做到细收细打，颗粒归仓。
    熟一块收一块，是各地保证不丢穗不丢粒的一项重要措施。南阳、开封等专区各县针对早秋作物大部分实行间作、混作的新特点，采取了先熟先收，后熟后收，棵熟收棵，荚熟收荚和收、护（保护未收的庄稼）并举的办法，大大减少了丢粒现象。
    在细收细打的同时，各地还特别注意复收、复打。商城县组织老人和小学生在一万八千多亩已收割的地里进行复收，收回粮食一万五千多斤。各地根据早秋作物种类多、成熟期不一等特点，在收割的同时，还加强了保秋、护秋工作。
    本报济南9日电　山东早秋作物的收获工作已全面展开。据6日统计，全省收割面积已达九百零九万七千亩，占早秋作物面积的66％以上。
    山东今年早秋作物的收割任务异常繁重。但由于贯彻执行党的大办农业、大办粮食的指示，从省级机关到生产大队，从领导干部到一般干部，纷纷走出办公室，深入基层，具体帮助生产队有组织、有计划地安排农活，从而既保证了管好晚秋，又使早秋收割工作顺利进行。
    在秋收中，各地对复收复打工作极为重视。
    本报长沙9日电　湖南省各地在抢收中稻中，做到了边收割、边脱粒、边车晒、边入仓，并特别注意细收细打，颗粒归仓。到9月2日统计，已经收回五百多万亩。
    为了做到适时收割，快收、收好，各地在收割开始，就十分注意合理安排劳力。根据技术特长，合理搭配，做到收、打、运、晒、藏五项工作环环扣紧，加快了收割进度。城步苗族自治县组织了一万四千多个劳力，使用割禾器、打稻机、车子等新式工具三千多部，分成收、运、晒、藏各种专业队，开展收割劳动竞赛，全县抢收工作的进度很快、质量很好。
    本报西宁9日电　青海省投入抢收的劳动力近五十万人，到9月3日，全省的麦类作物已经收割了45％以上。
    东部农业区的人民公社开镰最早，为了夺取麦收全胜，各公社普遍集中劳力投入秋收，同时还广泛开展成熟期迟早不同的山地和川地之间的协作，大搞收割工具改革，开展高工效竞赛，保证龙口夺食的麦收工作做得又快又细。大通县各人民公社集中90％的劳力收秋，开展每人日割一亩的竞赛运动，全县已有四分之一的生产队平均每人日割一亩以上，涌现出六千一百多名收割红旗手。
