　　Strong Drought and Flood Resistance, Adaptable to Different Climates:
　　China's "Golden Queen" Corn Achieves Bumper Harvest in Eastern Soviet Union

Xinhua News Agency, Khabarovsk dispatch: According to a TASS dispatch from Khabarovsk, the approximately 3,000 hectares of the Chinese corn variety "Golden Queen" planted in the Khabarovsk Krai of the eastern Soviet Union has yielded an exceptionally large harvest.

The corn harvest has now begun in the fields along the Amur River (i.e., the Heilong River). Corn is one of the main crops in this region. The "Golden Queen" corn has stronger drought and flood resistance than other varieties. This variety can adapt to different climatic conditions and yield a relatively stable harvest, with each hectare producing 750 centners of silage corn and 100-120 centners of ears.

It is planned to expand the planting area of "Golden Queen" several times in the Amur River region in the coming years.

    据新华社讯  据塔斯社伯力讯：在苏联东部伯力边疆区种植的约三千公顷的中国玉蜀黍品种“金皇后”，获得了特大丰收。
    在阿穆尔河（即黑龙江）沿岸的田野上，现在开始了玉蜀黍的收获工作。玉蜀黍是这个地区的主要农作物之一。“金皇后”玉蜀黍比其他品种有更强的抗旱、耐涝能力。这种品种可以适应不同的气候条件，得到比较稳定的收成，每公顷可以收获七百五十公担青贮玉蜀黍和一百——一百二十公担的棒子。
    预定在今后几年内，将在阿穆尔河沿岸地区把“金皇后”的播种面积再扩大几倍。
