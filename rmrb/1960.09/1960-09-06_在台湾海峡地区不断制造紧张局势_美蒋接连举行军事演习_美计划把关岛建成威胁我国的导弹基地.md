Xinhua News Agency, 5th: Taipei News: U.S. imperialism is constantly creating tensions in the Taiwan Strait area. Recently, it has colluded with the Chiang Kai-shek troops to hold successive military exercises, transporting large quantities of weapons and equipment to Taiwan to equip the Chiang Kai-shek troops. U.S. military generals are also constantly going to Taiwan to carry out aggressive activities.

According to Taiwan newspaper reports, the minesweeping fleets of the U.S. and Chiang Kai-shek navies have been conducting a five-day "mixed maritime training exercise" in the waters south of Taiwan since August 31. The U.S. side participating in the exercise includes five warships and tactical air force units. Prior to this, the United States had colluded with Chiang Kai-shek's troops to successively carry out provocative military activities such as "joint anti-submarine exercises," "mixed fleet combat exercises," and "air force maneuver exercises" in the waters and airspace of Taiwan.

The United States has also recently stepped up its military assistance to the Chiang Kai-shek clique. The U.S. Military Assistance Advisory Group in Taiwan announced at the end of August that the first batch of F-86D jet interceptor fighters recently shipped from the United States to Taiwan will soon be handed over to the Chiang Kai-shek Air Force. Prior to this, the United States had already handed over a batch of F-104 jet fighters to the Chiang Kai-shek Air Force. A shell factory built near Taipei City with five million U.S. dollars in military aid was also completed on September 1. This arsenal will produce mortar shells and other shells for the Chiang Kai-shek troops to use. In order to facilitate the military transportation of U.S. troops stationed in Taiwan, the United States recently allocated more U.S. aid for the Chiang Kai-shek clique to build a military highway between Taipei and Keelung, increasing the original one highway to two "to facilitate U.S. military transportation."

A large number of U.S. generals went to Taiwan in August one after another to carry out war conspiracy activities, including U.S. Pacific Air Force Command Commander O'Donnell, U.S. Pacific Fleet Commander Hopwood, U.S. Assistant Secretary of Defense Lincoln, and U.S. Eighth Army Chief of Staff Carda of the Korean War.

Xinhua News Agency, 5th: A United Press International dispatch from Washington on the 2nd pointed out that the United States is planning to turn Guam in the Western Pacific into a missile base to threaten China with war.

The news agency said that U.S. Navy planners are considering developing Guam's currently inadequate harbor facilities as a base for "Polaris" submarines capable of launching atomic missiles in the Western Pacific.

The news agency used the growth of China's power as an excuse, saying that it is "necessary" to send some "Polaris" submarines to the Pacific, and it is likely to happen in eighteen months.

    在台湾海峡地区不断制造紧张局势
    美蒋接连举行军事演习
    美计划把关岛建成威胁我国的导弹基地
    新华社5日讯　台北消息：美帝国主义在台湾海峡地区不断制造紧张局势，最近勾同蒋军接连举行军事演习，把大批武器装备运往台湾装备蒋军，美军将领也不断到台湾进行侵略活动。
    据台湾报纸消息，美国和蒋介石海军的扫布雷舰队从8月31日起，在台湾南部海面举行一连五天的“海上混合训练演习”，美国方面参加演习的有五艘军舰和战术空军部队。在这以前，美国已勾同蒋介石军队在台湾海面和上空先后举行了“联合反潜艇演习”、“混合舰队作战演习”、“空军机动演习”等挑衅性军事活动。
    美国最近还加强对蒋介石集团的军事援助。美国驻台湾军事援助顾问团在8月底宣布，最近由美国运到台湾的第一批F—86D型喷气截击战斗机即将移交给蒋介石空军。在这以前，美国已经把一批F—104型喷气战斗机交给蒋介石空军。美国拨出五百万美元军事援助在台北市近郊兴建的一个炮弹厂，也在9月1日建成，这个兵工厂将生产迫击炮弹和其他炮弹供给蒋军使用。为了便于侵台美军的军事运输，美国最近又拨出美援，要蒋介石集团在台北—基隆间增筑一条军用公路，从原有一条公路增为两条，“以利美军运输”。
    大批美国的将军在8月间先后到台湾进行战争阴谋活动，其中包括美国太平洋空军司令部司令奥当纳耳、美国太平洋舰队司令霍普伍德、美国国防部助理部长林肯、侵朝美军第八军参谋长卡达等。
    新华社5日讯　合众国际社2日从华盛顿发出的一条消息指出，美国正计划把西太平洋上的关岛变成一个对中国进行战争威胁的导弹基地。
    这家通讯社说，美国海军计划人员正在考虑发展关岛目前的不充分的海港设施，作为能发射原子导弹的“北极星”潜艇在西太平洋的基地。
    这家通讯社以中国威力的增长为借口，说“有必要”派遣一些“北极星”潜艇到太平洋去，而且很可能就在十八个月以后。
