    Since the launch of the water conservancy campaign, the irrigated area of farmland has gradually increased, followed by a growing area of multiple cropping. How to increase the yield of recropped wheat is a very important issue for many regions. As the multiple cropping index increases, the proportion of recropped wheat significantly increases. If this issue is not addressed, wheat production, and even the total crop harvest, will be greatly affected. According to surveys, the vast majority of the three categories of wheat fields are recropped wheat fields. The preceding crops in these fields are cotton or corn, etc. Due to delayed sowing and improper initial cultivation techniques, the growth and development of wheat seedlings are poor. Even if measures are increased in the later stages, the yield of such wheat fields is greatly affected, sometimes only yielding about 100 jin per mu. However, there are also recropped wheat fields that yield 300 to 400 jin per mu, with yields comparable to those of ordinary main-crop wheat. Regarding the issue of the wide variation in the yield of recropped wheat, some comrades from the Northwest Institute of Biology and Soil of the Chinese Academy of Sciences conducted investigations in the Yuncheng area of southern Shanxi in 1954 and 1955. Before this year's summer harvest, investigations were also conducted in the Bei Shangzhai Production Team of Yujin Commune in Lintong County, Shaanxi Province, and the Zhangjiagang Production Team in Xingping County. These survey results all prove that, in addition to water and fertilizer conditions, the sowing date of recropped wheat plays a major role in the growth and yield of recropped wheat.

        Early Sowing Leads to Higher Yields
    Regarding the yield-increasing effect of early sowing of recropped wheat, we investigated more than twenty wheat fields. The varieties in these wheat fields were mostly Bima No. 1, with only four comparison plots of 612, and experiments were conducted in three sowing date ranges: 1. Sowing recropped wheat earlier than main-crop wheat. 2. Sowing recropped wheat five to seven days later than main-crop wheat (but much earlier than in previous years). 3. Sowing recropped wheat ten to twenty days later than main-crop wheat (this is the old habit of the past, and many regions still sow recropped wheat on this date). Samples were taken from these fields to investigate the growth and development of the plants, and the yield was measured in practice (three to four square meters of representative plots were selected per mu for threshing and weighing). From these data, the yield-increasing effect of early sowing can be compared.

    The fertilization and management conditions of each comparison plot were roughly the same. The base fertilizer was generally about 6,000 jin of soil manure per mu, and the top dressing was 4,000 to 6,000 jin of wall and kang soil; most of the late-sown fields were top-dressed with 15 jin of ammonium sulfate per mu during the greening period, and four of the latest-sown fields were top-dressed with 25 to 30 jin of chemical fertilizer per mu. Therefore, the amount of fertilizer applied to late-sown fields was higher than that of early-sown fields.

    From the yield results of each comparison field, it can be seen that: First, sowing recropped wheat earlier than main-crop wheat increased the average yield by 159.5% compared to late sowing, and the general yield can reach 300 to 400 jin; with sufficient water and fertilizer and good management, the yield can reach more than 400 to 500 jin, catching up with and exceeding the yield of ordinary main-crop wheat in the local area. Second, sowing recropped wheat six to seven days later than main-crop wheat resulted in lower yields than early sowing, but the average yield still increased by 73.7% compared to the latest sowing. Third, the yield of late-sown recropped wheat was low, generally around 150 jin per mu, with the lowest being less than 100 jin.

    From the above results, it can be seen that early sowing plays an important role in increasing the yield of recropped wheat. We believe that advancing the sowing date of recropped wheat is an important method to eliminate the three categories of wheat fields and promote low-yield to high-yield, and it is a revolutionary measure for reforming the cropping system; early sowing can also promote the early maturity of recropped wheat by five to six days, which creates favorable conditions for continued multiple cropping.

        Main Reasons for Increased Production
    There are three reasons why early sowing of recropped wheat can greatly increase production:

    (1) Advancing the sowing date of recropped wheat can meet the temperature requirements of wheat tillering. The yield of wheat is greatly related to the amount and growth status of tillering before winter, and temperature is an important factor affecting tillering. According to previous scientific research, the most suitable temperature for wheat tillering is 13 to 18 degrees Celsius. Tillering decreases significantly below 13 degrees Celsius, and tillering stops below 6 degrees Celsius. Therefore, only early sowing can meet the temperature requirements of wheat tillering. To illustrate this point, we have preliminarily compiled the temperature data of the Xingping County Meteorological Station in the Guanzhong area, which is similar to the meteorological conditions of the Bei Shangzhai Production Team, for three years. By comparing the temperature changes with the temperature requirements of wheat, it can be seen that: (1) If sowing is done in late September, the tillering period is in mid-to-late October, when the temperature is 10.6 to 14 degrees Celsius, which is the most vigorous temperature for tillering. (2) If sowing is done in early October, the tillering period is in mid-November, when the temperature is 8.8 degrees Celsius, and tillering will decrease significantly. (3) If sowing is done in mid-to-late October, the tillering period will be delayed to late November or even December. At this time, the temperature has dropped to 4.6 degrees Celsius or below, so tillering is further reduced, or even impossible. Due to the decrease in temperature, not only is wheat tillering affected, but the growth of seedlings is also weakened. From this, it can be seen that only timely early sowing can meet the temperature requirements of wheat tillering, so that wheat seedlings can tiller more before winter, and the root system can develop well, laying a good foundation for the growth and development in the following year.

      (2) Advancing the sowing date of recropped wheat can greatly improve the growth status of wheat plants. Because early sowing meets the temperature requirements of wheat seedlings, the growth status of wheat plants is greatly improved. We investigated the growth status of wheat plants at different sowing dates, and the results are shown in the table below:

    From the comparison of the growth status of wheat plants at different sowing dates in the table, it can be seen that: Sowing recropped wheat earlier than main-crop wheat results in the tallest plants, the thickest stems, the most tillering and secondary roots per plant, and the best ear development. The second is sowing five to seven days after the main-crop wheat. The latest sowing grows the worst.

      (3) Advancing the sowing date of recropped wheat can make full use of water and fertilizer conditions. This is because, on the one hand, wheat grows vigorously after early sowing, so its ability to utilize water and fertilizer is also strong; on the other hand, at higher temperatures, manure applied to the land is more easily decomposed and utilized by wheat. We found from investigations in two production units that, under early sowing conditions, the yield of fields with good water and fertilizer was 53.3% higher than that of fields with poor water and fertilizer. Under late sowing conditions, the yield of fields with good water and fertilizer was 29.1% higher than that of fields with poor water and fertilizer.
  
  Issues to Note
    Advancing the sowing date of recropped wheat so that it is sown before the main-crop wheat is a simple and easy-to-implement measure to increase production when labor is well-arranged. However, when applying this measure, the following points should be noted:

      (1) Autumn crops such as corn should be planted early. If the autumn crops are planted late, the land will not be freed up, and recropped wheat cannot be sown. At the same time, cotton management should be strengthened to promote early maturity.

      (2) Before the corn or cotton is harvested, water should be irrigated first. When the soil moisture is suitable, the corn should be harvested or the cotton stalks should be pulled out, and then the land should be finely prepared for sowing.

      (3) The advance time should be determined according to the local temperature conditions, but it is best to sow recropped wheat first without changing the suitable sowing date of main-crop wheat. The specific experience of the Bei Shangzhai Team in Lintong County and the Zhangjiagang Team in Xingping County is that sowing from September 25 to the end of the month is best. According to the experience of labor model Zhou Jiguan and many people, it is more appropriate to sow recropped wheat after the "Autumn Equinox" and main-crop wheat before the "Cold Dew". If a small number of recropped wheat fields cannot be sown before the main-crop wheat is sown, it should not be delayed later than seven or eight days after the main-crop wheat (i.e., mid-October); and the land should be carefully prepared, harrowed and leveled, irrigated and fertilized, and it is best to apply some quick-acting fertilizers.

      (4) Attention should be paid to the applied varieties. The investigation confirmed that winter varieties such as "612" and "Bima No. 1" can be sown early, while semi-spring varieties such as "Nanda 2419" are susceptible to frost damage and should not be sown early.

    提早播种是回茬麦增产的关键	中国科学院西北生物土壤研究所小麦丰产研究组	陕西临潼县雨金人民公社北尚寨生产队
    水利化运动开展以后，农田的灌溉面积逐渐增大，随之而来的是复种面积日益增加。如何提高回茬小麦的产量，对许多地区说来，是一个十分重要的问题。因为复种指数提高以后，回茬小麦的比例显著增大，如不注意这一问题，对小麦生产，甚至作物的总收获量都会受到很大影响。据调查结果，小麦的三类田中绝大部分是回茬的麦田。这些田的前茬是棉花或玉米等作物，由于播期延迟和初期的栽培技术不当，致使小麦苗期生长发育不良。这样的麦田虽然在后期增加措施，产量也受到很大影响，有时只能获得亩产一百斤左右。但是，回茬小麦也有亩产三、四百斤的，产量与一般正茬麦不相上下。对回茬麦产量高低悬殊这一问题，中国科学院西北生物土壤研究所部分同志曾于1954和1955年在山西南部运城地区作过调查。今年夏收前，又在陕西省临潼县雨金公社北尚寨生产队与兴平县张家岗生产队作了调查。这些调查结果都证明：回茬小麦生长的好坏，产量的高低，在水肥条件以外，起着主要作用的是回茬小麦的播种期。
        提早播期产量高
    关于回茬麦提早播期的增产效果，我们共调查了二十几块麦田，这些麦田的品种大部分是碧蚂一号，只有四块对比地是612，分作三个播期范围作试验：一、将回茬麦提早到正茬麦以前播种。二、回茬麦比正茬麦的播期迟五到七天（但比往年的播期已大大提早）。三、回茬麦迟于正茬麦十余天至二十余天播种（这是以往的旧习惯，现在许多地区播种回茬麦的日期仍然是这样）。从这些田地上取样调查了植株生长发育状况，并且实测了产量（每一亩地选有代表性的地段三到四平方米脱粒称重），从这些资料可以比较出提早播期的增产效果。
    各对比地的施肥管理情况大致相同，底肥一般为每亩施土粪六千斤左右，浮粪为墙炕土四千至六千斤；晚播地大多于返青期每亩追施了十五斤硫铵，最晚播的田地其中有四块为每亩追化肥二十五至三十斤。因此，晚播地的施肥数量反较早播地为高。
    由各对比田的产量结果看出：第一，将回茬麦提早到正茬麦以前播种，比晚播的平均增产159.5％，一般产量可以达到三百至四百斤；水足肥饱，管理良好的，其产量可达四百至五百斤以上，赶上和超过了当地一般正茬小麦的产量。第二，回茬麦比正茬麦迟六至七天播种的，比提早播种的产量低，但比最晚播的平均产量仍增加73.7％。第三，晚播回茬麦的产量低，一般亩产一百五十斤左右，最低者不足一百斤。
    从上述结果可以说明，提早播种对提高回茬麦产量具有重要的作用。我们认为提早回茬麦播种期是消灭三类麦田，促使低产变高产的重要方法，是耕作制度改革的一项革命性措施；提早播种还可促使回茬麦早熟五至六天，这就为继续复种创造了有利条件。
        增产的主要原因
    回茬麦提早播种所以能大大增产，有以下三个原因：
    （一）提早回茬麦播种期可以满足小麦分蘖时对温度的要求。小麦的产量与冬前分蘖的多少和生育状况有很大的关系，而温度是影响分蘖的一个重要因素。根据以往的科学研究证明，小麦分蘖的最适宜的温度是摄氏十三度到十八度，十三度以下分蘖显著减少，六度以下即不再分蘖。因此，只有提早播期才能满足小麦分蘖时对温度的要求。为说明这一点，我们初步整理了与北尚寨生产队气象条件相近的关中地区兴平县气象站的三年内的气温资料。根据气温的变动与小麦对温度的要求加以对照可以看出：（一）如果9月下旬播种时，分蘖期在10月中下旬，这时气温在摄氏十点六度到十四度，是分蘖最盛的温度。（二）如果10月上旬播种时，分蘖期为11月中旬，这时气温在八点八度，分蘖会显著减少。（三）10月中下旬播种时，分蘖期即延迟至11月下旬，甚至12月份了。这时，温度已降低至四点六度或四点六度以下，因而分蘖更加减少，甚至不能分蘖了。由于温度的降低，不仅小麦分蘖受到影响，而且幼苗生长也减弱了。由此看来，只有适期早播，才能满足小麦分蘖对温度的要求，才能使小麦幼苗在冬前的分蘖多，根系发育良好，为下年的生长发育打下良好的基础。
      （二）提早回茬麦播种期可以大大改善小麦植株的生育状况。由于提早播期满足了小麦苗期对温度的要求，所以大大改善了小麦植株的生育状况。我们对各个不同播期的小麦植株生育状况进行了调查，结果见下表：
    由表中不同播期的小麦植株生育状况比较看出：将回茬麦提早到正茬麦以前播种，植株最高，茎秆最粗，单株分蘖与次生根最多，穗发育最良好。其次是正茬麦播后五至七天播种的。最晚播种的生长得最差。
      （三）提早回茬麦的播种期可以充分利用水肥条件。这是因为一方面小麦早播后生长势强，因此利用水肥的能力也强；另一方面在温度较高的情况下，施到地里的厩肥，比较容易分解被小麦利用。我们从两个生产单位的调查看出：在早播的条件下，水肥良好的比水肥差的田地，增产53.3％。而在晚播的条件下，水肥好的比水肥差的，增产29.1％。
  应注意的问题
    提早回茬麦播期，使它在正茬麦播前播种，在劳力安排好的情况下，是简而易行的增产措施。但是，在应用这一措施时，应注意以下几点：
      （一）要早种玉米等秋作物。如果秋作物种迟了，地腾不出来，回茬麦就种不进去。同时，应加强对棉花的管理，以促进早熟。
      （二）在玉米或棉花收获以前应该先灌一次水，在土壤湿度合适时即收玉米或拔花秆，然后精细整地进行播种。
      （三）提早的时间应根据当地气温条件而定，但是最好在不改变正茬麦适宜播期的情况下先种回茬麦。临潼县北尚寨队与兴平县张家岗队的具体经验是9月25到月底播种最好。按照周济广劳动模范和许多群众的经验，在“秋分”后种回茬，“寒露”前种正茬比较合适。如果少数回茬地在正茬麦播前来不及种完，延迟至正茬麦后，也不宜迟于正茬麦七、八天（即10月中旬）；而且要细致整地，耙耱平整，灌水施肥，最好增施一些速效性肥料。
      （四）应该注意应用的品种。调查中证实“612”和“碧蚂一号”等冬性品种可以提早播种，如“南大2419”等半春性品种易受冻害，不宜早播。调查　	播期  株高　  有效 　无效 　穗长　  结实　茎粗 　次生根地块　       （厘米） 分蘖   分蘖  （厘米） 小穗 （毫米）（条） 9  　9月下旬　108.6　0.4　  0.6  　6.0  　11.3 　3.1  　10.3 5  10月上旬  　80.8　0　    0.2　  5.4　  8.6  　2.5　   6.4 6  10月中下旬　71.2　0　    0  　  4.7　  8.6  　2.0　   5.6
