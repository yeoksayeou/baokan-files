　　Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, September 21st: According to Polish newspapers, socialist labor competitions have spread throughout Poland.

　　Inter-factory labor competitions have become the most popular form of competition in Poland today. Currently, 93% of enterprises in the Polish timber processing and forestry industries are participating in labor competitions; 87% of mining enterprises and 79% of metallurgical industry enterprises are involved in the national socialist labor competition movement. More than 6,000 production units across the country are competing for the twenty mobile advanced red flags set up by the Polish Council of Ministers and the Central Council of Trade Unions, and the 171 red flags set up by various production departments.

　　Inter-factory competitions are conducted on a half-yearly or yearly basis according to the production cycle of each production department. In addition to inter-factory competitions, there are also heated competitions between production teams within factories. Currently, there are more than 10,000 production teams participating in competitions nationwide, an increase of more than 4,000 from the end of last year.

　　The increasingly widespread competition to win the title of "Socialist Labor Team" is the most advanced form of competition in Poland today. Their competition conditions include not only completing higher production targets, but also improving business proficiency, engaging in political study, participating in social activities, and a series of other conditions. Currently, there are 3,000 production teams across the country participating in the competition to win the title of "Socialist Labor Team," and 96 of them have already won the glorious title of "Socialist Labor Team."

　　Nationwide competition activities have played a significant role in increasing the output of various production departments and promoting technological innovation.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, September 22nd: Many advanced factories and enterprises in the Soviet Union have received the title of Communist Labor Unit in the communist labor competition movement.

　　The Dnepropetrovsk Coke Chemical Plant is one of the first factories in the Soviet Union to receive the title of Communist Labor Factory. This factory has been at the forefront of the labor competition for several years and has been able to complete its annual plans ahead of schedule. In the first half of this year, it not only completed the production plan ahead of schedule, but also over-produced 25,000 tons of coal, 6,000 tons of coke, and chemical products worth several million rubles for the country, and also reduced costs. Currently, the coke produced there has the lowest cost in the Ukrainian Republic. Last year, the factory's employees put forward 700 rationalization proposals, saving the country 37 million rubles. 60% of the factory's workers are participating in regular spare-time study. So far, 14 work teams, 4 workshops and 3 sections in the factory have received the title of Communist Labor Unit.

　　The Donbass "Communist" mine has also received the title of Communist Labor Unit. It was put into production in 1953, and a year later its output was 24% higher than planned. If the average monthly coal production per worker in Donbass is 30 tons, then the "Communist" mine reached 54.7 tons last year, and increased to 60.2 tons in the first half of this year. The entire mine has over-produced 51,000 tons of coal this year. In terms of cost reduction, the cost of coal per ton in this mine was reduced by 5.4 rubles compared to last year. 50% of the miners in the entire mine participated in regular spare-time study.

　　The Vitebsk Carpet Factory in Belarus also recently received the title of Communist Labor Factory. The factory's labor productivity has now reached the 1964 level. In the first half of this year, without increasing manpower or equipment, the total output value of this factory increased by 18.4% compared with the same period last year, and 37,000 square meters of carpets were produced with saved materials. The factory exceeds its plan every month. Many factories and enterprises in large cities are striving for the glorious title of Communist Labor Factory. In Moscow, more than a dozen factories and enterprises have put forward guarantees to become Communist Labor Factories. More than a dozen factories in Leningrad have also put forward such guarantees.

    波兰社会主义劳动竞赛普遍开展
　  苏联许多先进工厂企业获得共产主义劳动单位称号
    新华社华沙21日电　据波兰报刊报道：波兰的社会主义劳动竞赛已经遍及全国。
    厂际劳动竞赛已经成为波兰当前最流行的竞赛形式。现在，波兰的木材加工和森林工业部门已经有93％的企业参加了劳动竞赛；87％的矿山企业和79％的冶金工业企业卷入了全国规模的社会主义劳动竞赛运动。全国共有六千多个生产单位正在展开竞赛，来争取波兰部长会议和工会中央理事会设置的二十面流动先进红旗和各生产部门设置的一百七十一面红旗。
    厂际竞赛是根据各生产部门的生产周期以半年或一年为期而进行的。除了厂际竞赛之外，工厂内部各生产队之间也展开了热烈的竞赛。现在，全国参加竞赛的生产队有一万多个，比去年年底增加了四千多个。
    目前日益广泛开展的争取“社会主义劳动队”称号的竞赛运动，是波兰当前高级的竞赛形式。它们的竞赛条件除了完成较高的生产指标外，还包括提高业务熟练程度、进行政治学习、参加社会活动等一系列条件。现在，全国共有三千个生产队参加了争取“社会主义劳动队”称号的竞赛，其中有九十六个生产队已经获得了“社会主义劳动队”的光荣称号。
    遍及全国的竞赛活动对提高各生产部门的产量和进行技术革新起了很大的作用。
    据新华社莫斯科22日电　苏联许多先进工厂企业在共产主义劳动竞赛运动中，获得了共产主义劳动单位的称号。
    第聂伯罗彼得罗夫斯克焦炭化学工厂，是苏联最先获得共产主义劳动工厂称号的工厂当中的一个。这家工厂几年来一直走在劳动竞赛的前列，每年的计划都能提前完成。今年上半年，它不但提前完成了生产计划，而且超额为国家生产了二万五千吨煤料、六千吨焦炭和价值几百万卢布的化学产品，并且还降低了成本。目前，那里生产的焦炭是乌克兰共和国中成本最低的。这家工厂的职工去年曾提出了七百条合理化建议，为国家节约了三千七百万卢布。全厂60％的工人都参加了正规的业余学习。到现在为止，厂内有十四个工作队、四个车间和三个工段已经得到了共产主义劳动单位的称号。
    顿巴斯“共产党人”矿井也获得了共产主义劳动单位的称号。它在1953年投入生产，一年之后便把产量比计划提高了24％。如果说顿巴斯每个工人每月平均的采煤量是三十吨，那么，“共产党人”矿井去年便达到了五十四点七吨，今年上半年又提高到六十点二吨。全矿井今年已经超额生产了五万一千吨煤。在降低成本方面，今年这个矿井每吨煤的成本比去年降低了五点四卢布。全矿井有50％的矿工参加了正规的业余学习。
    白俄罗斯的维切布斯克地毯工厂不久前也得到了共产主义劳动工厂称号。现在工厂的劳动生产率已经达到1964年水平。今年上半年，这个工厂不增加人力和设备，生产总值比去年同期增加了18.4％，用节约下来的材料生产了三万七千平方米地毯。工厂每月都超额完成计划。许多大城市的工厂企业正在努力争取共产主义劳动工厂的光荣称号。在莫斯科，有十几家工厂企业提出了争取成为共产主义劳动工厂的保证。列宁格勒也有十几家工厂提出了这样的保证。
