    Baltic Sea's Fishing City

    —New Look of Kaliningrad, a Fishing City on the Baltic Coast in Western Soviet Union

    On the western border of the Soviet Union, a famous fishing city, Kaliningrad, is thriving.

    Kaliningrad is located on the Baltic coast and is an important city in the westernmost part of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic. The city has wide streets, shady trees, and very beautiful scenery.

    During the Second World War, Kaliningrad was severely damaged by the Hitler fascists. When the Soviet army liberated Kaliningrad, not a single factory chimney in the entire city was smoking, and there were ruins everywhere. However, the heroic people were not intimidated by the difficulties. They built houses, schools, and hospitals with their own hands, and rebuilt factories. In the past ten years, Kaliningrad has undergone tremendous changes and has become an important economic and cultural center in western Soviet Union.

    Most of the residents of Kaliningrad are engaged in fishing. Over the ten years since the war, fishery production has continued to develop. In 1946, the Kaliningrad State-owned Baltic Fishery Company's catch was only 2,750 tons, while this year it plans to catch more than 240,000 tons.

    Kaliningrad fishermen, equipped with first-class fishing equipment, not only roam the Baltic Sea, but also frequently travel to the Atlantic Ocean. The perch off the coast of Newfoundland and the sardines in the equatorial sea cannot escape their nets.

    Soon, Kaliningrad will also establish a modern whaling fleet. By October, many huge whaling ships will be active in the Atlantic Ocean.

    Kaliningrad is an ice-free port. Ships from all over the world often gather in the port, loading and unloading various goods day and night. Kaliningrad's trucks, cranes, fiber knitwear, and canned food are also well-known at home and abroad.

    Kaliningrad's cultural and educational undertakings have also achieved great development. There are normal colleges and fishery colleges here, as well as specialized schools for papermaking, railways, and shipping, cultivating construction talents in various professions.

    Not far from Kaliningrad is the border between the Soviet Union and Poland. The people of Kaliningrad have close ties with the people of the Polish Olsztyn Province. People from both places often hold friendly get-togethers, sports competitions, and exchange delegations for friendly visits.

    波罗的海之滨的渔业城
    ——苏联西部城市加里宁格勒的新貌
    在苏联西部边境，一个著名的渔业城——加里宁格勒，正在欣欣向荣地发展着。
    加里宁格勒位于波罗的海之滨，是苏联俄罗斯联邦最西部的重要城市。市内街道宽阔，绿树成荫，风景十分秀丽。
    在第二次世界大战期间，加里宁格勒曾遭到希特勒法西斯的严重破坏。苏军解放加里宁格勒时，整个城市没有一个工厂的烟囱冒烟，到处是断垣残壁。但是，英勇的人民没有被困难吓倒，他们用双手建设起住宅、学校、医院，重建工厂。十几年来，加里宁格勒的面貌发生了巨大的变化，它已成为苏联西部一个重要的经济和文化重镇了。
    加里宁格勒的居民大部分以捕鱼为业。战后十余年来，渔业生产不断发展。1946年，加里宁格勒的国营波罗的海渔业公司捕渔量只有二千七百五十吨，而今年计划捕鱼二十四万吨以上。
    拥有第一流捕鱼设备的加里宁格勒渔民不仅驰骋在波罗的海的海上，他们还经常远征大西洋各地。纽芬兰海岸的鲈鱼、赤道海的沙丁鱼都难逃他们的渔网。
    不久，加里宁格勒还将建立起一支现代化的捕鲸船队。到10月间，很多巨大的捕鲸舰就要活跃在大西洋上了。
    加里宁格勒是个不冻港。港口内经常麕集着来自世界各地的轮船，日夜不停地装卸着各种货物。加里宁格勒的货车、起重机、纤维针织品、罐头等产品，在国内外也都很有名。
    加里宁格勒的文化教育事业也获得巨大发展。这里有师范学院和渔业学院，还有造纸、铁路、航运等专门学校，培养各种专业的建设人材。
    离加里宁格勒不远，就是苏联和波兰的边界。加里宁格勒人民和波兰奥兹汀省人民有着亲密的联系。两地的人民经常举办友谊性的联欢、体育比赛，互派代表团进行友好访问。
