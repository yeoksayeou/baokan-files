	Yes to Cuba, Yes to China, No to the Yankees!	Li Shaochun
	In front of the "Familia Hotel" in Santiago, the heroic city of Cuba, enthusiastic friends from Santiago surrounded three large cars, seeing off the Chinese Art Troupe for a performance tour of the "Sierra Maestra" mountainous region, the revolutionary base of Cuba.
	We were waving goodbye and exchanging souvenirs with the well-wishers crowded outside the car windows when suddenly someone eagerly jumped into the car. This person, with a red face, big eyes, and thick eyebrows, held a Cuban landscape postcard in his hand and introduced himself: his name was Dolca, a Cuban. He had seen our performance in the square last night and thought it was the most wonderful artistic enjoyment he had ever experienced, repeatedly calling our performance "top-notch art." As he spoke, he looked at us with surprise, trying to identify which roles we had played last night. Later, he exclaimed, "Only revolution can bring such top-notch art to perform for the masses in the square!" He also said, "I am a poor man, I have no valuable gifts, please take this picture to China to show my respect, please pay tribute to the great Chinese people, and pay tribute to the great leader of the Chinese people, Mao Zedong! Tell the Chinese people: the Cuban people are grateful to them!" We firmly shook his hand, promising to bring his good intentions back to our country and pinned a "China Supports Latin America" commemorative badge on his chest. He was so moved that his eyes were a little wet, and he repeatedly said, "Thank you!" Then he very excitedly hugged us and patted our backs (a friendly gesture of the Latin American people). The crowd outside the car also began to applaud.
	During its month-long visit, the art troupe visited six provinces and cities throughout Cuba, as well as mountainous areas (the rebel base), and everywhere we encountered honest, simple, and enthusiastic Cubans like Dolca.
	The art troupe's entire visit and performance in Cuba won the enthusiastic welcome of the Cuban people. Before we arrived in Santiago, the local people kept inquiring about the art troupe's news to the newspaper. Revolutionary organizations, official institutions, workers, militias, and students were all preparing to receive this cultural and artistic delegation from faraway China. The newspaper reported that the Chinese Art Troupe "brought us unity and support." Such concern from the people and such reports in the newspapers were the same in every city. Each time before the opening of the art troupe's performance, the audience burst into thunderous applause, often shouting the slogan "Great China!" From the opening to the finale, whether it was dance, solo singing, national instrumental ensemble or Peking opera, every program won the enthusiastic welcome and love of the audience; sometimes the audience threw hats or clothes at the performers to express their irrepressible excitement and emotion. Once, at a performance in the Havana Sports Palace, which could hold more than 20,000 spectators, a "July 26th March" was added to the national instrumental ensemble program. During the performance, the entire audience stood up and sang along with the music. The magnificent song sung by the big "choir" of more than 20,000 people was truly exciting. Even the reactionary American magazine *Time* could not help but admit: "...the biggest success belonged to the famous Chinese Art Troupe, which, on the opening night in Havana, used xiao and sheng to play Fidel Castro's favorite *July 26th March*, captivating the entire theater."
	Prime Minister Castro watched the art troupe's performance and expressed his extreme appreciation and love for the entire program. In a television address to the Cuban nation, he mentioned the Chinese Art Troupe, saying: "I like the performance of the Chinese Art Troupe, just as I like China. Peking opera is a different kind of art that we like. We have noticed that it is a humorous and new art. Its perfection, exquisiteness, and gesture performances make us like it, and it seems that this is the same feeling for all the people. ...Our impression of Peking opera is: seeing something from another world, something with real artistic value." Prime Minister Castro's evaluation of Chinese art gave us great encouragement.
	"Yes to Cuba, No to the Yankees!" is the Cuban people's favorite slogan, and we heard this magnificent slogan everywhere during our visit to Cuba. At the end of the performance of our art troupe in the Santa Clara Province gymnasium, which can accommodate 7,000 spectators, the entire audience first shouted: "Long live great China!" "Long live Cuban-Chinese friendship!" Then, in rhythmic applause, they shouted: "Cuba Si, Yankee No!" (meaning "Yes to Cuba, No to the Yankees!") After shouting it more than a dozen times, it changed to: "Yes to China, No to the Yankees!" The atmosphere became more and more enthusiastic, and the sound became more and more magnificent. These slogans reflected the common thoughts, feelings and wishes of the broad masses of the people.
	In Oriente Province, at a banquet held by city officials to entertain the art troupe, there were three Cuban friends around my seat, and there was no translator between us at that time. We could only say "hao" and "thank you" in Chinese and Spanish to each other. We had to use some "mime" actions to help convey what we wanted to say. Through gestures, I learned that two of them were dancers and one was a singer. We were all actors, and it was even more interesting to perform "mime." The content of our gestures ranged from love for Chinese art and Cuban songs and dances to the different characteristics of Chinese and Cuban dances, from the friendship between the Chinese and Cuban peoples to resolutely opposing American imperialism... Just as we were happily gesturing, a female dancer took out a pen and sketched a rough outline of the entire Cuban shape on a napkin, and then gently drew a long line from it, with the other end of the line pointing to China, saying "Hao!" Then she drew many lines, pointing to the Soviet Union and socialist countries and various Latin American countries. She said "Hao" as she drew, and finally she angrily scribbled many circles and poked countless dots in the position of the United States, and said repeatedly, "No!" Then we couldn't help shouting: "Yes to Cuba, No to the Yankees!"

### 要古巴，要中国，不要美国佬！

    要古巴，要中国，不要美国佬！	李少春
    在古巴的英雄城——圣地亚哥市的《大家庭饭店》门口，热情的圣地亚哥的朋友们围着三辆大型轿车，欢送中国艺术团去古巴革命根据地“马埃斯特腊”山区访问演出。
    我们正从车窗口和外面拥挤着的送行人们握手告别和交换纪念品，突然有一人急切地跳进汽车，这个人红脸膛、大眼睛、粗眉毛，手里拿了一张古巴风景明信片，冲着我们自我介绍：他叫多尔卡，是古巴人，他昨晚在广场看了我们的表演，认为那是他从未得到过的美好的享术享受，连称我们的表演是“顶高尚的艺术”。他边说边用惊奇的目光辨认我们昨晚演了哪个角色，后来他激动地说：“只有革命才能使这样高尚的艺术在广场上为广大群众演出”，还说：“我是个穷苦人，没有什么珍贵礼品，请你们把这张画片带到中国去，以表示我的敬意，请向伟大的中国人民致敬，向中国人民伟大的领袖毛泽东致敬！告诉中国人民：古巴人民感激他们！”我们紧紧握住他的手，答应一定把他的好意带回国去，并将一枚“中国支持拉丁美洲”的纪念章佩戴在他的胸前。他感动得眼圈有些湿润了，连连说着：“谢谢！”然后非常兴奋地和我们拥抱并拍着我们的背（拉丁美洲人民的一种亲切表示）。汽车外面的人群也跟着鼓起掌来。
    艺术团在一个多月期间，访问了古巴全国六个省、市以及山区（起义军根据地）等地，到处都碰到像多尔卡那样诚实朴素热情的古巴人。
    艺术团在古巴整个的访问演出博得了古巴人民极热烈的欢迎。我们未到圣地亚哥之前，当地人民不断向报社打听艺术团的消息，革命组织、官方所属机关、工人、民兵、学生都在准备接待这个由遥远中国来的文化艺术使团，报纸的报道并且认为，中国艺术团“给我们带来了团结和支持”。人民这样的关心，报纸这样的报道，在每个城市都是一样。每次在艺术团演出开幕前，观众便掌声如雷，往往还喊着“伟大的中国！”的口号。从开幕到终场，不论是舞蹈、独唱、民族器乐合奏或是京剧，每个节目都博得观众热烈欢迎与喜爱；有时候观众把帽子或上衣向演员们扔去，以表示他们抑制不住的兴奋和情感。一次在能容两万多观众的哈瓦那体育宫演出，民族器乐合奏节目中加演了一个《七·二六进行曲》，演奏时，全体观众站起来随着音乐齐声高唱。两万多人的大“合唱队”唱起了雄壮的歌曲，激昂的歌声真是激动人心。就连反动的美国刊物《时代》杂志也不能不承认：“……最大的成功是属于那著名的中国艺术团，在哈瓦那开幕的晚上，该团用箫笙演奏了菲德尔·卡斯特罗最喜欢的《七·二六进行曲》，倾倒了整个剧院”。
    卡斯特罗总理看了艺术团的演出，对整个演出节目都表示极为欣赏和喜爱，他在向古巴全国作电视讲演中，提到中国艺术团说：“我喜欢中国艺术团的表演，正如我喜欢中国一样。京剧是一种使我们喜欢的，与众不同的艺术。我们注意到了它是一种有风趣的新的艺术，它的完善、精美、手势表演都使我们喜欢，好像这对全体人民来说都有同样的感觉。……我们对京剧的印象是：看到了另一个世界的东西，具有真正艺术价值的东西。”卡斯特罗总理对中国艺术的评价，给了我们很大的鼓舞。
    “要古巴，不要美国佬！”是古巴人民最爱喊的口号，我们在古巴访问期间，到处都听到这个雄壮的口号。我们在圣克拉拉省能容纳七千观众的体育馆演出终场时，全体观众先喊着：“伟大的中国万岁！”“古巴中国友谊万岁！”然后在有节拍的掌声中喊起：“古巴西，洋基诺！”（意即“要古巴，不要美国佬！”）喊过十几遍后，又变为：“要中国，不要美国佬！”气氛越来越热烈，声音越来越雄壮。这些口号反映了广大群众的共同思想感情和愿望。
    在奥连特省，市负责人举行招待艺术团的宴会上，我的座位周围有三位古巴朋友，当时我们之间并没有翻译。我们彼此间只能用中国话和西班牙话说“好”和“谢谢”。我们只好用些“哑剧”动作来帮助传达我们要讲的话。通过手势动作，我知道了他们当中有两位舞蹈家和一位歌唱家，我们都是演员，演起
  “哑剧”来更觉得有意思。我们比划的内容，从喜爱中国艺术和古巴的歌舞谈到中国和古巴的舞蹈不同特点，从中古两国人民的友谊到坚决反对美帝国主义……。我们正比划得高兴时，一位女舞蹈家拿出笔来在餐巾上草草地画了一个全古巴图形轮廓，又轻轻地从中画出长长的一条线，线的另一头指向中国，嘴里说着：“好！”然后又画了许多线，指向苏联和社会主义国家以及拉丁美洲各国，她随画随说“好”，最后她在美国的位置上气狠狠地涂了许多圈圈，又戳了无数点子，嘴里连说：“不！”于是我们都情不自禁地喊起：“要古巴，不要美国佬！”
