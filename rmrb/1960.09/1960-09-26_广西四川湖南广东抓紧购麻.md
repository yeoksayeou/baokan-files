Xinhua News Agency, Nanning. Guangxi commercial departments are seizing the opportunity during the current ramie harvesting season to vigorously purchase and process ramie.

This year in Guangxi, the ramie planting time was delayed compared to previous years due to climate influences. However, due to strengthened field management in various locations, sufficient base fertilizer was applied, more fertilizer was used, and weeding and soil cultivation were diligently carried out, resulting in good growth. Currently, various locations are rushing to harvest the second crop, with the entire region having harvested 50%. Some areas are preparing to harvest the third crop.

In the ramie procurement work, commercial departments in various locations have dispatched staff to the front lines of production, working alongside commune members to cut and scrape the ramie, assisting production teams in rationally arranging labor, and strengthening technical guidance to ensure the smooth progress of procurement work. Guanyang and Yangshuo counties, the main ramie producing areas, dispatched more than 270 cadres to production teams to help with current late-rice field management and promote ramie procurement and processing. In Lipo County, Liche Commune, a major ramie producing area, with the assistance of commercial staff, mobilized more than 200 urban residents, students, cadres, and some laborers during the spare time of late-rice field management for a short-term concentrated procurement effort. Currently, the second crop has been fully purchased and processed.

During the procurement process, various locations have also strengthened the processing and transportation of ramie.

Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu. Commercial departments in Sichuan are strengthening the procurement of hemp and ramie. Currently, they are seizing the opportunity to simultaneously collect, purchase, process, and transport to support industrial production and meet market needs.

Although Sichuan Province's hemp crops suffered relatively severe natural disasters this year, thanks to the great superiority of the people's communes, while focusing on grain production, they strengthened the field management of hemp crops, allowing hemp and ramie to still grow well. During the marketing of hemp and ramie, commercial departments sent cadres deep into the main producing areas to help rural areas properly arrange labor and conscientiously implement national procurement policies, enabling many areas to complete harvesting and sales tasks in a short period. Commercial departments in Guanxian and Dazhu, when purchasing, actively publicized the state's procurement policies to the masses, carefully carried out distribution work based on the principle of balancing the interests of the state, the collective, and the individual, appropriately retained hemp for management areas and commune members according to proportions, and encouraged the masses' enthusiasm for selling hemp. Guanxian completed the hemp procurement task in more than 20 days.

Currently, people's communes in various parts of Sichuan are stepping up the field management of the third-season ramie, striving for a bumper third crop to better support national construction.

Xinhua News Agency, Changsha. Various parts of Hunan Province are making a concentrated effort to purchase ramie. As of September 10, the province's purchase of the first and second crops increased by 4% compared to the same period last year.

All parts of the province have closely integrated the harvesting, peeling, and procurement of ramie, forming a "one-stop" process. Party committees of communes in various locations properly arranged labor, adopting a combination of professional teams and mass campaigns to harvest and peel ramie. Commercial departments combined with production departments to promote more than 20,000 new-style ramie peeling tools such as "Yuanjiang No. 2" and "double-knife type" throughout the ramie-producing areas of the province. The peeling efficiency of these tools is generally twice as high as manual labor. Due to the early, meticulous, and intensive efforts in harvesting and peeling, the province's harvesting and peeling of the first and second crops was basically completed in about ten days, achieving careful peeling and fine production.

While harvesting and peeling, commercial departments actively improved procurement methods. In Yuanjiang County, a key ramie-producing area, more than 1,000 purchasing cadres went deep into the communes and teams to inspect, bundle, settle accounts, and transport on the spot, greatly facilitating the masses and speeding up the procurement process.

Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou. People's communes in various jute producing areas of Guangdong Province have recently launched a widespread upsurge in selling jute to the state, and the amount of jute purchased has increased significantly. The four key jute producing areas of Huazhou, Dongguan, Chao'an, and Jieyang have purchased the largest quantities in the province. Various locations are gradually transporting the jute already purchased to support urban industrial production.

Jute in Guangdong Province began to be harvested successively in August. After the end of summer planting, Party committees of communes in various producing areas adopted a combination of organizing professional teams to harvest and mobilizing the masses of commune members for concentrated harvesting, which greatly accelerated the progress of jute harvesting and peeling. Commercial departments adapted to the requirements of the communes and further strengthened jute procurement work. The commercial department of Huazhou County, the largest jute producing area, dispatched a large number of employees to the countryside at the end of August, adding fixed procurement points and mobile procurement teams to facilitate sales by commune members.

　　广西四川湖南广东抓紧购麻
    据新华社南宁电　广西商业部门抓紧在当前苧麻成熟期间，大力收购和加工苧麻。
    今年广西因受气候影响，苧麻的种植时间比往年推迟了，但是由于各地加强田间护理工作，基肥下得足，施肥多，除草、培土工作抓得紧，因而生长情况仍然较好。目前各地正在抢收二麻，全区已收割50％，部分地区正着手准备收割三麻。
    在苧麻收购工作中，各地商业部门派出职工深入生产第一线，与社员一道割麻、刮麻，协助生产队合理安排劳动力，加强技术指导，促使收购工作顺利开展。主要产麻区灌阳、阳朔两县派出二百七十多名干部到生产队，帮助做好当前晚稻田间管理，又推动苧麻收购与加工工作。荔浦县主要产麻区荔城公社，在商业职工协助下，在晚稻田间管理空隙时间，发动城镇居民、学生、干部二百多人和部分劳动力，短期突击收购，目前二麻已全部收购与加工结束。
    在收购过程中，各地还加强了苧麻的加工与调运工作。
    据新华社成都电　四川各地商业部门加强大麻、苧麻的收购工作。目前正在抓紧时机，边收、边购、边加工、边调运，支援工业生产和供应市场需要。
    四川省麻类作物今年虽然遭受到较严重的自然灾害，但是由于各地人民公社发挥了极大的优越性，在抓粮食生产的同时，加强了麻类作物的田间管理，使大麻、苧麻仍然得到了较好的生长。在大麻、苧麻上市期间，商业部门派干部深入主要产麻区，帮助农村妥善安排劳动力，认真贯彻国家收购政策，使许多地区在短时期内就完成了收割和交售任务。灌县、大竹等地商业部门在收购时，积极向群众宣传国家的收购政策，根据兼顾国家、集体、个人三者利益的原则，认真作好分配工作，对管理区和社员用麻按比例适当留下，鼓励了群众售麻的积极性，灌县在二十多天中就完成了大麻收购任务。
    目前，四川各地人民公社正在抓紧做好三季苧麻的田间管理工作，争取三麻丰收，更好地支援国家建设。
    据新华社长沙电　湖南省各地突击收购苧麻。截至9月10日，全省收购的头麻和二麻比去年同期增加4％。
    全省各地都将苧麻的收割、剥制、收购等项工作紧密结合起来，环环扣紧，形成“一条龙”。各地公社党委妥善安排劳力，采取专业队伍与群众突击相结合的办法收剥苧麻，商业部门与生产部门结合，在全省产麻区推广“沅江二号”、“双刀式”等新式剥麻工具两万多件；这些工具的剥麻效率比手工一般提高二倍。由于对收剥工作抓得早、抓得细、抓得紧，全省头麻和二麻的收剥工作在十天左右就基本完成，并且做到了精剥细制。
    在收剥的同时，商业部门积极改进了收购方法。重点产麻区沅江县，一千多名采购干部深入社队，就地验收，就地捆扎，就地结算，就地调运，大大便利了群众，加快了收购进度。
    据新华社广州电　广东省各黄麻产区的人民公社最近普遍掀起向国家出售黄麻的热潮，黄麻收购数量显著上升。全省以化州、东莞、潮安、揭阳四个黄麻重点产区收购的数量最多。各地正将已经收购的黄麻陆续运出来，支援城市工业生产。
    广东省的黄麻在8月份相继开始收割。在夏种结束以后，各产区公社党委采取组织专业队收割和发动广大社员突击收割相结合的办法，使黄麻收割和剥皮工作的进度大大加快。商业部门适应公社的要求，进一步加强了黄麻的收购工作。黄麻产量最多的化州县商业部门，8月底派出大批职工下乡，增设了固定收购点和流动收购组，便利社员出售。
