　　Fearless Female Doctor

　　In the Kuibyshev Collective Fishery on the coast of the Sea of Okhotsk in the Soviet Union, Yekaterina Pagidisheva is known as the "Fearless Female Doctor." Her deeds of braving wind and snow to travel long distances to rescue patients have deeply moved many people.

　　It turned out that in the great forests of the Okhotsk coast, there was a solitary small house belonging to a line inspector. Unfortunately, the inspector's wife, a pregnant woman, suddenly fell ill, and her condition was very critical. However, there was not a single person within ten kilometers, and the surrounding area was a vast forest and a frozen, desolate sea.

　　The news reached the district center, Ayan, and the district decided to transport a doctor by helicopter. However, the coastal climate was extremely harsh at the time, and the helicopter could not take off.

　　A day or two passed, and the weather still did not improve. There was only one way, which was to walk there. Yekaterina Pagidisheva volunteered to take on this task.

　　It was a very difficult journey of forty-seven kilometers. This forty-five-year-old woman braved the snow and crossed mountains, snowfields, and flooded streams, walking for seventeen hours until she reached the coast the next day. At that time, the patient had already lost consciousness. Pagidisheva did everything in her power to save the lives of the young woman and her child.

　　For this, the District Party Committee and the District Executive Committee awarded Pagidisheva a certificate of merit. (Yi)

　  不怕困难的女医生
    在苏联鄂霍次克海滨的古比雪夫集体渔场，人们把叶卡契林娜·帕吉迪舍娃称为“不怕困难的女医生”。她冒着风雪长途跋涉抢救病人的事迹，使很多人深受感动。
    原来，在鄂霍次克海滨的大森林里，有着线路检查员的一幢孤零零的小房子。不幸，检查员的妻子，一个怀孕的妇女，忽然得了病，病情十分危急。但是，在十公里以内的地方，连一个人也没有，周围是一片大森林和冰封的、死寂的大海。
    消息传到了区中心阿扬，区里决定用直升飞机运医生去。但是当时沿海气候极端恶劣，直升飞机不能起飞。
    一两天的时间过去了，天气仍没有好转。只有一个办法，那就是走路去。叶卡契林娜·帕吉迪舍娃自告奋勇，担当了这一任务。
    这是一段四十七公里长的十分艰难的路程。这位四十五岁的妇女冒雪穿过山林、雪地和泛滥的溪水，徒步十七小时，直到第二天才到了海滨。当时病人已经失去了知觉。帕吉迪舍娃尽一切力量，终于挽救了那个年青妇女母子的生命。
    为此，区党委会和区执委会给帕吉迪舍娃颁发了奖状。　　（逸）
