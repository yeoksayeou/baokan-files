Xinhua News Agency, September 23rd. The head of the Black African Teachers' Federation delegation, N'Do Amadou, who is currently visiting China, told Xinhua reporters here on the 22nd: The United Nations should immediately stop interfering in the Congo and let African countries solve African affairs themselves.

He also said, "We believe that the United Nations is in fact creating chaos in the Congo. We believe that African countries should withdraw their troops from the 'UN forces' and put their troops under the control of the Congolese government."

N'Do Amadou is the Deputy Secretary-General of the Unified Non-Religious Education Union of Senegal. When receiving reporters from this agency, he also condemned the imperialist suppression of the national independence struggles of the Algerian and Cameroonian people. He said, "No force can stop the movement of a country's people towards independence. Imperialism tries every means to prolong the situation of colonial rule, but the national liberation of these countries is inevitable. China's experience and the Chinese people's thirty years of arduous struggle until victory prove this."

He expressed great optimism about the future of the national independence movements of the peoples of various African countries. He said, "The national independence movements of the peoples of various African countries are developing rapidly and are realizing a leap forward like China. We are confident that in the near future, all of Africa will be liberated."

N'Do Amadou pointed out that the African people clearly recognize from concrete facts who are their friends and who are supporting them against imperialism. "We regard all those cursed by imperialism as our friends, and we cannot trust those praised by imperialism." He pointed out, "We deeply feel how concerned the Chinese people are about the African people's struggle for national independence. This proves that there is a very solid and friendly connection between the African and Chinese people."

N'Do Amadou praised the Sino-Guinean Friendship Treaty signed in Beijing not long ago and expressed the hope that other African countries could sign similar friendship treaties with China. He said, "This will be conducive to friendship between Africa and China." He also emphasized that Black African countries should strengthen ties with China and support each other in the struggle against imperialism and in building their own countries.

When talking about his impressions of visiting China, N'Do Amadou strongly condemned the imperialist slanders against the Chinese people, falsely claiming they are "belligerent." He said that imperialist slanders and defamations are not worth paying attention to. Imperialism says that the Chinese people's opposition to U.S. imperialism's occupation of China's own territory, Taiwan, is "belligerent," just as they call the Algerian and Cameroonian people's struggle for national independence "rebellion" and give it all kinds of most heinous adjectives. He also said, "We are convinced that peace-loving and freedom-loving people all over the world support the Chinese people's actions to liberate Taiwan. Taiwan is an inseparable part of Chinese territory."

Koulibaly, the news secretary of the Sudanese Non-Religious Unified Union, who was also present, said that in China, we saw the Chinese people love labor and strive to build and improve their living standards. "All people who love labor and construction are peace-loving, because war is not construction, but destruction."

N'Do Amadou also enthusiastically praised China's Great Leap Forward and people's communes. He said that the socialist construction carried out by the Chinese people is a great cause. He said that from the experience of China's Great Leap Forward, it can be seen that relying on the masses of the people, with the conscious support of the masses of the people, there is nothing that cannot be done. The establishment of the Chinese People's Commune is an important matter in our view. It plays a very important role in freeing farmers from backward production methods and gradually filling the gap between urban and rural areas. He also praised China's educational policy of combining education with productive labor and theory with practice.

### 黑非洲教师联合会代表团团长发表谈话　联合国应该立即停止干涉刚果

　  黑非洲教师联合会代表团团长发表谈话
　　联合国应该立即停止干涉刚果
    新华社23日讯　正在我国访问的黑非洲教师联合会代表团团长恩多·阿玛杜22日在这里对新华社记者说：联合国应该立即停止干涉刚果，让非洲国家自己解决非洲的事务。
    他还说，我们认为联合国事实上在刚果制造混乱局面。我们认为非洲国家应该从“联合国军”中撤出自己的军队，把他们的军队交给刚果政府支配。
    恩多·阿玛杜是塞内加尔非宗教教育统一工会副总书记。他在接见本社记者的时候，还谴责了帝国主义对阿尔及利亚人民和喀麦隆人民民族独立斗争的镇压。他说，任何力量不能阻止一个国家的人民走向独立的运动。帝国主义想尽办法来延长殖民统治的局面，但是这些国家的民族解放是不能避免的。中国的经验和中国人民三十年来的艰苦斗争直到胜利证明了这一点。
    他对非洲各国人民的民族独立运动的前途表示十分乐观。他说，非洲各国人民的民族独立运动正在迅速向前发展，正在实现同中国一样的跃进。我们确信，在不久的将来，全非洲将获得解放。
    恩多·阿玛杜指出，非洲人民从具体的事实中清楚地认识到谁是他们的朋友，谁是支持他们反对帝国主义的人。“我们把所有被帝国主义咒骂的人看作是自己的朋友，对那些被帝国主义颂扬的人，我们是不能信任的。”他指出，我们深切地感到中国人民是如何关切非洲人民争取民族独立的斗争。这证明非洲人民和中国人民之间存在着非常巩固的和友好的联系。
    恩多·阿玛杜赞扬了不久前在北京签订的中国几内亚友好条约，并表示希望其他非洲国家能同中国签订类似的友好条约。他说，“这将有利于非洲和中国的友谊。”他还强调黑非洲各国同中国应加强联系，在反对帝国主义斗争中和建设自己的国家方面互相支持。
    在谈到访问中国的观感时，恩多·阿玛杜强烈谴责了帝国主义污蔑中国人民所谓“好战”的谰言。他说，帝国主义的污蔑和诽谤是不值得理睬的。帝国主义把中国人民反对美帝国主义占领中国自己的领土台湾说成是“好战”的，这正如同它们把阿尔及利亚人民和喀麦隆人民争取民族独立斗争说成是“叛乱”，并给它戴上各种各样最可恶的形容词一样。他还说，“我们确信，全世界爱好和平自由的人民支持中国人民解放台湾的行动。台湾是中国领土不可分割的一部分。”
    当时也在座的苏丹非宗教统一工会新闻书记库利巴利说，我们在中国看到中国人民热爱劳动，努力进行建设和提高自己的生活水平。“一切爱好劳动建设的人民是爱好和平的，因为战争不是建设，而是破坏。”
    恩多·阿玛杜还热情地赞扬了中国的大跃进和人民公社。他说，中国人民所进行的社会主义建设是一个伟大的事业。他说，从中国的大跃进的经验可以看到，依靠人民群众，有了人民群众自觉的支持，就没有任何事情是作不到的。中国人民公社的建立在我们看来是重要的事情。它在使农民摆脱落后生产方法上起着非常重要作用，并逐步在填平城乡之间的鸿沟。他还称赞了我国教育和生产劳动相结合、理论和实践相结合的教育方针。
