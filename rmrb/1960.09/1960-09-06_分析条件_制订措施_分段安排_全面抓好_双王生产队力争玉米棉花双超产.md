    Shuangwang Production Team Strives for Double Overproduction of Corn and Cotton
    Launch a high work efficiency movement, effectively strengthen autumn field management, and start autumn sowing preparations early
    Xi'an, September 3rd (This newspaper) – Members of the Shuangwang Production Team of Chengguan Commune in Weinan County, Shaanxi Province, based on the local production characteristics, and in the spirit of "taking grain as the priority, increasing both grain and cotton production; grasping the present and preparing for next year," have repeatedly discussed and comprehensively arranged to strive for double overproduction of corn and cotton on the original basis.
    In the discussions, the team members detailed the current difficulties and favorable conditions. The difficulty is the relative lack of labor. The multiple cropping area here reaches 100%, and the corn and cotton area has expanded by four hundred mu compared to last year. In addition, a new commercial vegetable base of more than three hundred mu has been built. Since the farmland has basically achieved garden-style management, the farming is becoming more and more detailed, and the labor required is much more than in previous years. This year, due to the severe drought in the autumn fields and late planting, and the excessive concentration of rain since August, the crops have shown a "greedy green" phenomenon, which will affect the timely sowing of wheat this year. However, there are many favorable conditions at present: one is that county and commune cadres have gone to the front line to strengthen leadership. Second, under the principle of strengthening field production, 161 laborers have been transferred from auxiliary labor and non-production personnel, making the number of people engaged in field production reach 90.68% of the total labor force. Third, the arrival of new labor has further boosted the team members' confidence in increasing production, and their enthusiasm has been further enhanced. Fourth, at present, the autumn field crops are generally growing well. The corn seedlings are uniform and complete, with thick stalks and green leaves. According to the ranking results, third-class seedlings account for only 11%; the boll shedding rate of cotton is also greatly reduced compared to previous years, generally reduced by 40%, and each plant has already produced more than ten bolls, an increase of about three compared to the same period last year. Combining the analysis of the situation and studying the People's Daily editorial "Immediately Launch a Production Increase and Thrift Movement Centered on Grain and Steel," the team members generally realized that the present is a great opportunity to strive for increased autumn field production and do a good job in autumn sowing preparations. According to past experience, if we continue to strengthen management during this period, each corn plant can increase in weight by at least six qian, and each cotton plant can grow four more bolls. The team members' confidence in increasing production has generally improved, and they have further formulated practical measures to increase production. While discussing measures to increase autumn field production, arrangements were also made for autumn sowing preparations. According to the principle of combining multiple planting for multiple harvests with high yield for multiple harvests, the team plans to expand the wheat field area and build one thousand-mu high-yield plot and ten hundred-mu high-yield plots, and immediately dispatch special personnel to comprehensively check seeds, sowing tools, drought-resistant equipment, and other work. Ensure that the soil moisture is sufficient, the base fertilizer is adequate, the ground is leveled, the seeds are carefully selected, the soil is treated, and the seeds are mixed with pesticides.
    In order to ensure that grain and cotton production increase and autumn sowing work are not delayed, all work is divided into three stages: The first stage focuses on a concentrated effort to manage autumn fields. In the morning, the dew in the fields is heavy and it is not easy to operate, so all labor is concentrated on accumulating fertilizer and working on vegetables; in the morning and afternoon, 60% of the labor force is used to manage corn and 40% to manage cotton. The second stage focuses on a concentrated effort to prepare base fertilizer for autumn sowing fields. In the morning, in addition to continuing to accumulate fertilizer (or transport fertilizer) and working on vegetables, 40% of the labor force is used to accumulate fertilizer (or transport fertilizer) in the morning and afternoon, 30% to manage corn, 20% to manage cotton, and 10% to manage vegetables. This stage requires that all the base fertilizer for wheat fields be transported to the fields, and every effort must be made to make way for autumn harvest and autumn sowing. When the corn is 90% ripe, inter-row harvesting (pulling up a few rows of corn stalks) will be implemented to free up roads and send the base fertilizer to the fields to speed up the autumn sowing. The third stage is to concentrate all efforts to rush harvest and rush planting. All labor will be organized into professional groups according to each person's physical strength, skills, and crop needs, and they will harvest, chop stalks, transport, fertilize, deep plow, sow, and ridge at the same time, striving to achieve clean land and empty fields within twenty days.
    Currently, the high work efficiency movement of each small team has been launched. The team members have adopted various measures to improve work efficiency in managing autumn fields. For corn, fertilization is carried out in front and cultivating is carried out behind, so that the fertilizer application does not need to cover the fertilizer with soil, reducing a process. For cotton, removing old leaves, breaking off crazy buds, and pushing the plants to merge the ridges are carried out at one time, greatly shortening the labor process. The Wu Yang team recently accepted the team members' opinions and promoted the method of a cart of manure out of the village and a cart of soil back, achieving no empty carts and killing two birds with one stone. Since this spring, the North-South team has not separated male and female labor in the production process. Often, either the fertilizer was not transported completely or the weeds were not completely hoeed. According to the suggestion of female team member Yang Guilan, men accumulate fertilizer and transport fertilizer, and women apply fertilizer and hoe weeds, giving full play to their respective strengths. There are fifteen women in the team who are skilled in cotton planting, and they specialize in cotton farming.
    The team members do what they say. In the past few days, when it rains and clears, the team members face the wind and rain to collect fertilizer. The Wu Yang team of seventy members collected enough household fertilizer and street fertilizer for twenty mu of land in one day. As soon as the weather clears, the team members go to the fields. Cotton planting expert Xue Junxiu's cotton field and the cotton field of Zhang Qiuxiang, a national labor model from a neighboring team, are adjacent. Their two work groups pushed the plants together and merged the ridges after the rain to allow the cotton to ventilate and receive light. Through this specific measure, they launched a competition. Under their leadership, all the team's tasks have launched opponent competitions. From August 22nd to now, all the autumn fields have been fertilized once, weeded once, and more than 24 million catties of fertilizer have been sent to the edge of the fields. (Attached picture)

    分析条件　制订措施　分段安排　全面抓好
    双王生产队力争玉米棉花双超产
    开展高工效运动，切实加强秋田管理，秋播准备也提早进行
    本报西安3日电　陕西渭南县城关公社双王生产队社员，根据当地生产特点，本着“以粮为先，粮棉双增产；一手抓当前，一手抓明年”的精神，反复讨论，全面安排，力争玉米和棉花在原有基础上达到双超产。
    在讨论中，社员们详细地摆出了当前的困难和有利条件。困难是劳力较缺。这里复种面积达100％，玉米、棉花面积比去年扩大了四百亩，此外还新建商品性蔬菜基地三百多亩。由于农田基本上实现了园田化，作务越来越细，需要的劳动力也就比往年多得多。今年又因秋田大旱，下种迟，8月份以来雨水又过分集中，因而出现了作物“贪青”现象，由此就会影响到今年及时种麦。但是，当前也有着许多有利的条件：一个是县、社干部下到第一线，领导加强。再则，在加强田间生产的原则下，先后从辅助劳力和非生产人员中抽调劳力一百六十一名，使田间生产人数达到总劳力90.68％。第三，由于生力军开到田间，社员们增产的信心更高了，干劲因此更足。第四，目前全队秋田作物普遍生长良好，玉米苗齐苗全，秆粗叶绿，根据排队结果，三类苗只占11％；棉花蕾铃脱落率也比往年大大减少，一般减少40％，平均每株已经结桃十个以上，比去年同期增加三个左右。结合分析情况又学习了人民日报“立即开展一个以粮、钢为中心的增产节约运动”的社论，使社员们普遍认识到当前是力争秋田增产和做好秋播准备工作的大好时机。据以往经验，如果趁今后这段时间继续加强管理，玉米每株至少还可增重六钱，棉花每株可以多长四个桃。社员们增产信心普遍提高了，进一步订出了切实的增产措施。在讨论秋田增产措施的同时，对于秋播准备工作也作了安排。根据多种多收与高产多收相结合的方针，全队计划扩大麦田面积并建千亩丰产方一个、百亩丰产方十个，并立即抽派专人，全面地检查了种子、播种工具、抗旱设备等工作。保证做到地墒饱、底肥足、地整平、精选种子、处理土壤和药剂拌种。
    为了保证粮、棉增产和秋播工作三不误，把全部工作分为三个阶段：第一阶段，以突击秋田管理为主。早上田间露水大，不好操作，集中所有劳力积肥和务菜；上午和下午以60％劳力管玉米，以40％劳力管棉花。第二阶段，以突击给秋播田准备底肥为主。早上除继续积肥（或运肥）和务菜外，上午和下午以40％劳力积肥（或运肥），30％管玉米，20％管棉花，10％管蔬菜。这个阶段要求把麦田底肥全部运到地头，千方百计为秋收秋播让路。当玉米熟到九成时，实行间行收割（连秆拔下几行玉米），腾出道路，把底肥送到地里，以加快秋播速度。第三阶段，集中一切力量抢收抢种，把所有劳力按照各人体力、技术、作物需要，编成专业组，边收割、边砍秆、边拉运、边施肥、边深翻、边播种、边整畦，争取二十天内做到地净场光。
    目前，各个小队的高工效运动已开展起来。社员们采取各种提高工效的措施管理秋田，玉米采取了前边施肥，后边中耕，施肥的人不必再用土盖肥料，减少了一道工序。棉花采取打老叶、掰疯芽、推株并垅一次进行，大大缩短了劳动过程。吴杨小队最近接受了社员意见，推行了车子出村一车粪、回来一车土的办法，做到了车不空回，一劳两用。南北小队自今春以来，男女劳力没有分开使用，在生产中，往往不是这里的肥没运完，就是那里的草没锄净，根据女社员杨桂兰建议，男积肥、运肥，女施肥、锄草，充分发挥了各人的特长。队里有十五个妇女，植棉技术熟练，她们就专门作务棉花。
    社员们说干就干，这几天乍雨乍晴，社员们就迎风顶雨，收集肥料。吴杨小队七十名社员在一天之内，收集的家庭肥料和街肥足够二十亩地用。天一晴，社员们就下地了。植棉能手薛俊秀植棉小组的棉田和邻队植棉能手、全国劳动模范张秋香植棉小组的棉田连畔，她们两个作务组就雨后推株并垅，让棉花通风透光。通过这项具体措施，她们便展开了竞赛。在他（她）们的带动下，全队各项活路都展开了对手赛。从8月22日到现在，已经给所有的秋田施了一次肥，锄了一次草，还把二千四百多万斤肥料送到了地边。（附图片）
