　　Mongolian and Han Brothers Unite Well
　　Boyintu
    Beneath the Ebo Engeer Mountain on the vast Ujimqin grassland, a field of waist-high wheat shines with golden light. The harvested crops are piled up like small hills. This is the grain and fodder base of the Saruletuya (Dawn) Production Brigade of the Arshan Baolige Commune. This year, the more than 15,700 mu of wheat, barley, millet, foxtail millet, soybeans, potatoes, and fourteen or fifteen other kinds of crops and vegetables sown are growing particularly well.
    Mongolian herdsmen say: Our brigade vigorously runs the grain and fodder base. That such good crops can grow on the Ujimqin grassland is the result of the close mutual help between Mongolian and Han farmers and herdsmen who are as close as brothers. Indeed, since the people's commune, the friendship between the Mongolian and Han people has become even deeper.
    In the past, the herdsmen of Ujimqin did not know how to farm, and many had never even seen crops. Since Saruletuya Brigade started operating the fodder base in 1956 until now, they have been asking Han farmers to teach them technology. More than a dozen farmers, including Peng Fude from Ningcheng County, immediately led the herdsmen into production after arriving in this brigade. As people arrived, all kinds of farm tools were continuously transported in. When there were not enough farm tools, the farmers who knew carpentry took materials locally and rushed to make wooden plows. When there were plows but no rope sets, the Han farmers took out their own ropes to make sets, and they cultivated and sowed on time. The herdsmen were so moved by this enthusiastic help that some were moved to tears. They vacated their yurts for their Han farmer brothers to live in, and took out beef, mutton, and milk curd for the Han farmers to eat. Many herdsmen even gave the sheepskins they planned to use to make leather robes to their farmer brothers to make leather clothes.
    Mongolian herdsmen learned agricultural techniques from Han farmers day and night while holding the plow. Peng Fude and others taught many people in this brigade how to hold the plow, sow, and weed. Seventeen-year-old girl Shamuga, who came to the fodder base after putting down her lasso pole, learned to use the seed drill, harrow, sow, and weed in the spring, and is now learning to harvest crops. In her spare time, the little girl helps the single Han farmers mend their clothes.
    During the spring sowing this year, one day, Shamuga saw that the sole of the old farmer Zhang Dequan's shoe was broken, and his toes were exposed. During the noon break, she ran home in one breath, took the boots her father wore, and gave them to Zhang Dequan, but Zhang Dequan refused to wear them. In the evening, the girl's father, old man Suodenamu, returned from herding and, after hearing about this, rode his horse to personally deliver the boots again, insisting that Zhang Dequan wear them. The old herdsman said: "The farmer brothers and my child eat in the same pot every day, work in the fields together, and teach her agricultural techniques, discuss important production matters together in meetings, and laugh together. Aren't we all one family? If it weren't for the new society, how could our Mongolian and Han families live together like close brothers?" Only then did Zhang Dequan leave the boots and put them on.
    In more than two years of labor, Zhang Dequan has deeply fallen in love with the hardworking and simple Mongolian herdsmen. He said that he wants to make Ujimqin his second hometown and contribute his strength to the prosperity of the grassland and the increasingly better life of the Mongolian brothers.
    With the enthusiastic help of the Han farmers, many people in this brigade have learned most of the farm work. What is even more gratifying is that a group of local cadres from herdsmen have learned agricultural technology and the knowledge to lead agricultural production from Han farmers. The captain of this brigade, Communist Party member Bai Yila, is an excellent old herdsman with many years of herding experience. With the enthusiastic help of Han farmers in recent years, he has now become a skilled leader of agricultural production.
    The herdsmen personally felt the good times created by the joint efforts of the Mongolian and Han brothers, and happily sang:
    Brave riders are trained by training brave horses,
    Beautiful flowers are cultivated by hardworking gardeners,
    If you want to praise the good growth of crops on the grassland,
    It's better to praise our Mongolian and Han brothers for helping each other and uniting well!

　　蒙汉兄弟团结好
　　博音图
    辽阔的乌珠穆沁草原鄂博恩格尔山下一片齐腰的麦子，闪耀着金色的光芒，割倒后的庄稼堆起来像一座一座的小山。这是阿尔山宝利格公社萨如勒图雅（曙光）生产大队的粮食饲料基地。今年播种的一万五千七百多亩小麦、大麦、糜子、谷子、大豆和马铃薯等十四、五种作物和蔬菜都长得特别好。
    蒙古族牧民们说：我们大队大办粮食饲料基地，乌珠穆沁草原上能长出这样好的庄稼，是蒙汉族农牧民亲如兄弟般的互相帮助的结晶。的确，自从人民公社化后，蒙汉族人民的友谊更加深厚了。
    乌珠穆沁的牧民过去不会种地，好多人甚至从来没有见过庄稼。萨如勒图雅大队从1956年开始经营饲料基地直到现在，都是请汉族农民传授技术。从宁城县来的彭福德等十多个农民，到这个大队之后，马上带领牧民，投入生产。人来了，各种农具也源源运来。农具还不够，会木工活的农民就地取材，赶制木犁。有了犁没绳套，汉族农民拿出自己的绳子作套，按时开荒播种。牧民对这些热情帮助，有的感动得流泪。他们把自己住的蒙古包腾出来，给汉族农民兄弟住，把牛羊肉、奶豆腐拿出来给汉族农民吃，好多牧民把自己打算做皮袄的羊皮，也给农民兄弟作了皮衣了。
    蒙古族牧民，日夜跟犁向汉族农民学习农业技术。彭福德等人，就在这个大队教不少人学会了扶犁、点种、锄草等农活。放下套马杆子就来到饲料基地的十七岁的姑娘沙木嘎，春天学会了摇耧、耙地、点种和锄草，现在又学会了收割庄稼。小姑娘劳动之余就帮助单身汉农民缝补衣裳。
    今年春播时，一天，沙木嘎看见老农张德全的鞋底破了，脚指头露在外面。中午休息时，她一口气跑回家，把她爹穿的靴子拿来，送给张德全，张德全怎么也不穿。晚上，姑娘的父亲索德那木老人放牧回来，听到这件事后，骑上马亲自又把靴子送来，非得叫张德全穿上不可。老牧民说：“农民兄弟和我孩子天天在一锅里吃饭，一块下地干活，还教给她农业技术，一起开会商量生产大事，一起说笑，这还不是一家人吗？要不是新社会，咱们蒙汉两家，哪能像亲兄弟一样的生活在一起呢？”张德全这才把靴子留下穿上了。
    张德全在两年多的劳动中，深深地爱上了勤劳朴实的蒙古族牧民，他说，要把乌珠穆沁作他的第二个故乡，要为草原的繁荣，为蒙古族兄弟生活的蒸蒸日上，贡献出自己的力量。
    在汉族农民的热情帮助下，这个大队已有不少人学会了大部分农活。更可喜的是一批当地牧民出身的干部，向汉族农民学会了农业技术和领导农业生产的知识。这个大队的队长、共产党员白依拉就是个有多年放牧经验的优秀的老牧工，几年来在汉族农民热情的帮助下，现在又成了领导农业生产的能手。
    牧民们亲自感受到蒙汉兄弟共同创造的好光景，高兴地唱道：
    骠骏的马儿是勇敢的骑手训练出来的，
    美丽的群花是辛勤的园丁培育出来的，
    要夸草原上庄稼长得好啊，
    还不如夸我们蒙汉兄弟互相帮助团结得好！
