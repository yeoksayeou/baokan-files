Xinhua News Agency, Conakry, September 14th: African figures here warmly welcome the joint communiqué just released by China and Guinea, the signing of the Treaty of Friendship, the Economic and Technical Cooperation Agreement, and the Trade and Payment Agreement between the two countries. They unanimously pointed out that this is a significant contribution to international peace, and the African people firmly support it.

Keita Koumandian, President of the Black African Teachers' Union, said: The signing of the Sino-Guinean Treaty of Friendship and various agreements not only marks a new stage in Sino-Guinean friendly relations, but also demonstrates China's continued active support for the struggle of African people against imperialism and colonialism, and for national independence, defense and economic development. He said: The signing of the Sino-Guinean Treaty of Friendship once again demonstrates China's love of peace.

Kingue Abel, Vice President of the Cameroon People's Union, said: These agreements show that China's aid to Guinea is not only large in scale but also does not attach any political conditions. This opens up a new era for the people of Guinea, who have freed themselves from foreign occupation. Moreover, the warm and fraternal welcome the Guinean delegation received in China proves the unwavering willingness of the Chinese people to further strengthen friendly ties with the people of African countries, and is also a great blow to the imperialists, who have been viciously attempting to reconquer our newly independent countries through enslaving agreements.

He pointed out: The people of China have shown through concrete actions their respect for the African people, and the people of African countries are fully aware of this.

Kagansa Hogi, one of the leaders of the People's Movement for the Liberation of Angola, said: The people of African countries are deeply pleased with the achievements made by the President of Guinea's visit to China. The joint communiqué, Treaty of Friendship, Economic and Technical Cooperation Agreement, and Trade and Payment Agreement signed between Guinea and China eloquently prove the growing support of the Chinese people for the people of African countries, and the leaders of Guinea and China fully understand their common cause.

He said: These agreements and treaties will mark a new stage in the struggle between the forces of peace, cooperation, and unity and the conspiracies of war and the system of exploitation. He went on to say that the people of African countries are determined to continue the decisive struggle to eliminate the common enemy—imperialism.

He also pointed out that the isolation of the African people over the long years is coming to an end; the people of the African continent will more firmly strengthen cooperative relations with the People's Republic of China and other Asian countries.

    非洲各国人士赞扬中几友谊的新发展
    指出中国人民和非洲人民的友好合作是对帝国主义的巨大打击
    新华社科纳克里14日电　在这里的非洲各国人士热烈欢迎中国和几内亚刚发表的联合公报、两国签订的友好条约、经济技术合作协定以及贸易和支付协定。他们一致指出，这是对国际和平的重大贡献，非洲人民坚决地予以支持。
    黑非洲教师工会主席凯塔·库芒迪昂说：中几友好条约和各项协定的签订，不仅在中几友好关系中，标志着一个新阶段，而且表明中国不断地积极支持非洲各国人民为反对帝国主义和殖民主义、争取和保卫民族独立和经济发展而进行的斗争。他说：中几友好条约的签订再一次表明中国热爱和平。
    喀麦隆人民联盟副主席金格·阿贝尔说：这些协定表明中国对几内亚的援助，不但规模巨大而且不附任何政治条件。这对摆脱了外国占领的几内亚人民开辟了一个新时代的前景；而且几内亚代表团在中国所受到的热烈、亲如兄弟的欢迎，证明了中国人民要进一步加强同非洲各国人民友好联系的不可动摇的意愿，同时也是对帝国主义者的巨大打击，因为帝国主义者一直恶毒地企图通过奴役性的协定来重新征服我们这些新独立的国家。
    他指出：人民中国以具体的行动表明它对非洲人民的尊重，非洲各国人民是完全认识到这一点的。
    安哥拉人民解放运动的负责人之一的卡甘萨·霍吉说：非洲各国人民对几内亚总统的中国之行所取得的成就深深感到高兴。几内亚和中国之间签订的联合公报、友好条约、经济技术合作协定以及贸易和支付协定，雄辩地证明了中国人民日益声援非洲各国人民，几内亚和中国领导人完全了解他们的共同事业。
    他说：这些协定和条约将标志着和平、合作和团结的力量同战争阴谋和剥削制度的斗争中的一个新阶段。他接着说，非洲各国人民决心继续进行决定性的斗争来消灭共同的敌人——帝国主义。
    他还指出：非洲人民在漫长的岁月中的孤立处境，开始结束了；非洲大陆各国人民，将更加坚定地同中华人民共和国以及其他亚洲国家加强合作关系。
