A Wholehearted Devotion to Agriculture
    ——The Story of Shanghai Retiree Gu Fusheng Wang Xuesheng He Yao

    In the early autumn morning, a cool breeze rustles through the fertile fields, and the golden rice stalks are laden with heavy ears, swaying in the wind. It's truly a magnificent scene of agricultural abundance.

    In a spacious and bright dormitory of the Chongming No. 1 Steel Machinery Factory, a group of elderly people are gathered around a table. Some are wearing reading glasses, intently poring over technical books, while others are softly discussing a central topic – how to rapidly equip "Chonggang," this young factory, so that it can fully play its role in supporting agricultural technical transformation...

    They are a group of veteran workers from Shanghai's industrial front with decades of production experience.

    The clock strikes six, time for breakfast. Suddenly, someone asks: "Where's Master Gu Fusheng?"

    "Oh, he's been in the workshop since early morning for that gantry planer."

    Just as everyone is discussing, Master Gu returns from the workshop, covered in sweat.

    "How is it?" As soon as he steps through the door, many people ask with concern.

    "I worked on it all night, and the vibration is slightly better this morning. I think the key is still that the parts aren't precise enough and need to be improved..." Master Gu replies while washing his hands.

    Contributing to Agriculture
    Master Gu was originally a retired veteran worker from the China Textile Machinery Factory in Shanghai, having worked as a planer for decades. He is now sixty-six years old. In 1957, with the care of the Party and the government, Master Gu enjoyed retirement benefits. However, although he retired, his heart did not. At home, he still frequently concerned himself with the country's construction and the factory's production situation. Especially since the Great Leap Forward, the booming development of production and construction has made him even more restless. He has voluntarily gone to the factory more than once to "take on business," hoping to contribute to the Great Leap Forward again.

    This year, the Party further put forward the policy of taking agriculture as the foundation and industry as the leading factor in the national economy, and called on all walks of life to vigorously support agriculture. Faced with this battle call, Master Gu yearned so much to go to the countryside, to use his rich technical experience to support the technical transformation of agriculture! Now, this wish has come true.

    On July 9th, the chairman of the trade union of the China Textile Machinery Factory told him: The Party agreed that he and several other veteran workers would go to Chongming to support agricultural technical transformation. That night, he was so excited that he could hardly sleep. To express his feelings to the Party, he put on his old glasses under the lamplight and spent two hours writing a solemn guarantee, stating that in supporting agricultural technical transformation, he would unreservedly pass on all of the production technical knowledge and experience he had accumulated in actual production over the decades to the younger generation in the countryside.

    On July 12th, Master Gu, this veteran worker who had retired for three or four years, re-packed his luggage and, with the same excitement as a young person embarking on a journey for the first time, stepped onto a new work post.

    When he walked into the Chongming No. 1 Steel Machinery Factory, he was attracted by the thriving scene before him:

    In the newly built red-tiled and gray-brick workshops, the "buzzing" of motors resounded; the tall iron smelting furnaces blazed with raging flames; the heads of machine tools rotated rapidly; the squares around the workshops were piled high with assembled green fodder cutters, water pumps, and cast iron parts waiting to be processed; in a corner of the square, some workers were filing and grinding, repairing the tractors of the rural people's communes... This is a factory that manufactures and repairs agricultural machinery and undertakes the task of arming commune-run industries. Two years ago, it had only dozens of workers. Due to the needs of Chongming County's agricultural technical transformation, it has now rapidly developed to more than seven hundred people.

    Master Gu, who had not been to the countryside for more than two years, was filled with joy when he saw the vigorous new atmosphere of rural industry. He said to the workers in the factory: "You've worked hard. Let's work together to make the factory even more prosperous!"

    Immersed in New Work
    Originally, the leadership decided that retired workers going to the countryside to support agriculture would serve as technical instructors, only needing to give verbal guidance, and working a maximum of six hours per day. However, Master Gu often went to work and left work with the workers, completely immersed in this new job. Every day, he walked from this machine tool to that machine tool, watching, thinking, speaking, and doing. He cared about everything from products, machines, tools, and fixtures to what the workers would do next and what fixtures should be improved. He even asked about a piece of sandpaper lying on the ground. He picked it up and said to the workers: "Sandpaper on the ground gets damp. Once it's damp, it's not easy to use."

    With the development of agricultural construction, Chongming County's demands on the Chonggang No. 1 Factory are getting higher and higher. Not only does it need to manufacture more large-scale agricultural machinery, but it also urgently needs to build machine tools to arm commune-run factories. Large components such as the bases of large machines require giant gantry planers for processing. To solve this key equipment problem, the Chonggang No. 1 Factory started preparing as early as a year ago. Master Gu arrived in Chongming just in time for the installation of the twelve-foot gantry planer.

    Master Gu knew that this was equipment related to the technical transformation of agriculture throughout Chongming County, and the sooner it was installed, the sooner it could play its role. That morning, he went to see the work done by the night shift the night before without eating breakfast; as soon as he started work, he assembled, disassembled, studied, and pondered with everyone; after work, when it was time to sleep, he still restlessly went to the workshop to take a look. He put his whole body and mind on this planer.

    Master Gu and everyone fought together for more than three weeks, and the twelve-foot gantry planer was finally installed.

    Cultivating the Younger Generation
    How important it would be to cultivate technical forces for county-run and commune-run industries to promote agricultural technical transformation! Master Gu regarded this as an important part of his work. He knew that the vast majority of workers at the Chonggang No. 1 Factory came from the countryside, and they were still farmers holding hoes two years ago. Master Gu was especially diligent in helping them improve their skills. Next to the machine tools, one could often see him speaking softly, tirelessly guiding these new workers.

    "Master Gu, what causes the tool to break easily?" When Shi Fengtao, a twenty-two-year-old young planer, was working, the most troubling thing was that the tool would easily break if the speed was too high, and he had never found the reason. Once, he took a sharp planer tool and asked Master Gu. Master Gu picked up the planer tool, put on his reading glasses, looked at it carefully, and pointed to the tool head, saying: "The back angle of the planer tool is ground too small. When the back angle is small, the tool is thin, and the tool will easily break if the speed is increased."

    Shi Fengtao listened blankly, nodding only and responding with "uh, uh." But he was thinking in his mind: "Wouldn't the tool be blunt if the back angle is large!" Master Gu knew that this young man had not yet understood. The next day, he ground a tool himself and gave it to Shi Fengtao to try. Shi Fengtao saw that it was a rounded off-set tool with a large back angle. He installed it on the planer with suspicion, and followed the old rules to control the cutting depth at three millimeters.

    "You can deepen it." Master Gu said. Little Shi immediately increased it to five millimeters.

    "You can deepen it again... This kind of tool can be increased to ten millimeters. Your planer is weak, so you can eat seven millimeters." Master Gu was still cheering him on from the side.

    Shi Fengtao increased it to seven millimeters, and it worked very smoothly. The efficiency was doubled compared to the past. The planed parts were smooth, shiny, and of good quality. Master Gu said with a smile: "With a large back tool angle, the tool has a greater load-bearing capacity, so it is not easy to break, and you can increase the speed and improve efficiency. When the speed is fast, the workpiece will be planed smoothly." Shi Fengtao was very impressed, and he was determined to learn well from Master Gu.

    Master Gu also liked to ask such questions to inspire workers to use their brains and think independently about problems: "Do you think you can go faster?" "Think about it, if you change the method to do it, would it be easier? Would the effect be better?"

    Under Master Gu's careful guidance, the technical level of these young workers has improved rapidly. Now they all know what tool to use for what work, and how to grind the tool to be good; they can also actively consider what kind of fixture to use for what work. Some young people say: "Master Gu teaching us for two months is better than learning for a year in the past."

    Now, the young Chonggang No. 1 Factory is growing rapidly. Master Gu, like many other veteran workers, is determined to contribute all his strength to the great cause of agricultural technical transformation.

    一片忠心为农业
    ——记上海退休老工人顾复声的故事	王绪生　何瑶
    初秋的早晨，凉风吹拂着肥沃的原野，金黄色的稻禾上挂着沉甸甸的穗子，随风摆动。真是一片农业丰收的大好景象。
    崇明第一钢铁机械厂一间宽敞明亮的宿舍里，一群老年人围坐在桌前。有的戴着老花眼镜，聚精会神地在翻阅技术书籍，有的在轻轻地谈论着一个中心课题——如何把“崇钢”这个年轻的工厂迅速装备起来，使它在支援农业技术改造中充分发挥作用……。
    他们是一群来自上海工业战线上的有着几十年生产经验的老工人。
    时针指向六点，该是早餐的时候了。忽然有人问：“顾复声老师傅呢？”
    “他呀，为了那台龙门刨，一早就到车间去了。”
    大家正在议论的时候，顾师傅满头大汗地从车间里回来了。
    “怎么样？”他一脚刚跨进门，许多人都关心地问。
    “昨晚，搞了一夜，今天早上震动得稍微好些了，我看关键还在零件不够精密，还得改进……”顾师傅一边洗手，一边回答。
    为支援农业出把力
    顾师傅原是上海市中国纺织机械厂的退休老工人，做了几十年的刨床活，今年已六十六岁了。1957年，顾师傅在党和政府的关怀下，享受了退休养老的待遇。但是，人退休，心却没有退休。他在家里，还是经常地关心着国家的建设和厂里的生产情况。特别是大跃进以来生产建设蓬勃发展的景象，使他更加不能平静下来。他曾不止一次地主动到厂里去“揽生意”，希望自己能给大跃进再出一把力。
    今年，党进一步提出了国民经济以农业为基础、以工业为主导的方针，并号召各行各业大力支援农业。顾师傅在这个战斗号召面前，是多么向往着到农村去，运用自己丰富的技术经验，来支援农业的技术改造啊！现在，这个愿望实现了。
      7月9日，中国纺织机械厂的工会主席告诉他：党同意他和其他几位老工人一起，去崇明支援农业技术改造。当天晚上，他兴奋得简直睡不着觉。为了向党表达自己的心意，在灯光下，他戴起老光眼镜，花了两个钟头，端端正正地写了一份保证书，表示在支援农业技术改造中，一定要把自己几十年来在实际生产中积累的一些生产技术知识和经验，毫无保留地全部传授给农村的年轻的一代。
    7月12日，顾师傅，这个退休了三、四年的老工人，重新整理了行装，怀着跟年轻人第一次踏上征途一样的兴奋心情，走上了新的工作岗位。
    当他走进崇明第一钢铁机械厂时，就被展现在眼前的一派兴旺景象吸引住了：
    一座座新建的红瓦灰砖的车间里，鸣响着“嗡嗡”的马达声；高大的炼铁炉子冒着熊熊的火焰；机床的车头在飞速地旋转；车间周围的广场上堆满了装配好的青饲料切割机、水泵和正待加工的铸铁件；广场的一角，一些工人正在锉呀磨呀，修理农村人民公社的拖拉机……。这是一个制造、修理农业机械和担负着武装社办工业任务的工厂，两年前还只有几十个工人，由于崇明县农业技术改造的需要，现在已经迅速发展到七百多人。
    已经两年多没有到过农村的顾师傅，看了农村工业蓬蓬勃勃的新气象，满心喜悦。他对厂内的工人说：“你们辛苦了，让我们一起把工厂办得更加兴旺吧！”沉浸在新的工作里
    本来领导上决定退休工人下乡支援农业，是担任技术指导，只要口头上指点指点就行了，每天工作最多不超过六小时。可是顾师傅却常常与工人一起上班，一起下班，完全沉浸在这个新的工作里了。每天，他从这台机床走到那台机床，一面看，一面想，一面讲，一面做。他从产品、机器、刀具、工夹具，一直到工人下一次要做什么活、应该改进什么工夹具等等，没有一样不关心的。甚至连丢在地上的一角砂皮，他也要过问一下，一面拾，一面对工人说：“砂皮丢在地上，要发潮。一发潮，用起来就不应手了。”
    随着农业建设的发展，崇明县对崇钢一厂的要求愈来愈高了，不但要它制造出更多的大型农业机械，还迫切需要它造出工作母机来武装社办工厂。大型机械的底座等大部件，都需要巨型龙门刨来加工。为解决这个关键性的设备，崇钢一厂早在一年之前就动手准备，顾师傅一到崇明正碰上十二呎龙门刨的安装工作。
    顾师傅知道这是一台关系着整个崇明县农业技术改造的设备，早一天安装好就能早一天发挥作用。那天早上，他早饭未吃，就去看看昨天夜班一晚上的工作情况；一上班又和大家一起装、拆，推敲、琢磨；下了班，该睡觉的时候了，他还不放心地到车间里去转一转。他把整个身心都放在这台刨床上了。
    顾师傅和大家一起奋战了三个多星期，十二呎龙门刨终于安装好了。
    培养年轻的一代
    为县办工业、社办工业培养技术力量，对促进农业技术改造该有多么重大的意义啊！顾师傅把这作为自己工作中的一个重要内容。他知道崇钢一厂的工人绝大部分来自农村，他们在两年前还是拿锄头的农民。帮助他们提高技术，顾师傅分外尽心。在机床旁边，常常可以看到他低声细语，谆谆不倦地指导着这些新工人。
    “顾师傅，刀子容易断是什么原因呢？”二十二岁的青年刨工施凤陶做活时，感到最伤脑筋的是：车速快了，刀就容易崩断，一直没有找到是什么原因。一次，他拿了一把尖尖的刨刀问顾师傅。顾师傅拿起刨刀，戴上老花眼镜，仔细瞧了一瞧，指着刀头说：是刨刀的后角磨得太小，后角一小，刀子就单薄，车速加快，刀就容易断了。
    施凤陶呆呆地听着，不点头，只是“唔、唔”地答应着。他脑子里却在想：后角一大，刀子不是要钝了么！顾师傅知道这个小伙子还没有搞通。第二天，他就自己磨了一把刀子，交给施凤陶试试看。施凤陶一看，这是把后角圆大的偏刀。他将信将疑地装在刨床上，照老规矩把切削深度掌握在三个毫米上。
    “还可以加深。”顾师傅说。小施立即加到了五个毫米。
    “再可以加深……这种刀可以加到十个毫米。你这部刨床力道小，可以吃七个毫米。”顾师傅还在旁边打气。
    施凤陶加到七个毫米，使起来十分顺当，效率比过去提高了一倍。刨过的零件光滑滑、亮晶晶的，质量很好。顾师傅笑着说：“后刀角大，刀子承担力就大，就不容易断，就可以加快车速，提高效率，车速一快，工作物就刨成精光的了。”施凤陶心里十分佩服，他下定决心，一定要好好向顾师傅学习。
    顾师傅还喜欢提出这样一些问题来启发工人动脑筋，独立思考问题：“你觉得还可以快一些吗？”“你想一想，换一种方法来做，是不是可以便当一些？效果会更好一些？”
    在顾师傅的悉心指导下，这些青年工人的技术水平提高得很快。现在他们都能知道做什么活应该用什么刀，刀子怎么磨法才算好；也能主动考虑什么活该用什么样的工夹具。有的青年说：“顾师傅教我们两个月，胜如过去学一年。”
    现在，年轻的崇钢一厂正在迅速地成长。顾师傅和其他许多老工人一样，决心把自己所有的力量全部贡献给农业技术改造的伟大事业。（原载解放日报，本报有删节）（附图片）
