　　Rouzi Haili is the Party General Branch Secretary of the Grape Valley Management Area of the Grape Commune in Turpan County. When we were still at the county party committee and commune party committee, we heard people’s comments about him: “Rouzi Haili never complains about any task assigned by the Party, never says ‘difficult,’ and always relies closely on the masses to bravely overcome difficulties and complete the task.” The Uyghur farmers of Grape Valley even more like to praise their Party General Branch Secretary with these words: "The Communist Party leads us onto the road of happiness, and Rouzi Haili leads everyone across the ditches on the road!" Since Rouzi Haili took office as the General Branch Secretary of the Management Area more than two years ago, he has always been diligent and dedicated, working hard for the Party and the masses, making Grape Valley a truly happy mountain valley.

　　"Sorghum Without Seeds"
　　Stepping into the entrance of Grape Valley, a novel scene immediately attracted us: in the vineyards with interlaced vines, clusters of sorghum grew like stars, the stalks as thick as arms, the heavy ears bent over, truly good crops. When we visited Grape Valley, the captain of Leyuan Brigade said to us as soon as we met: "I have lived for more than forty years and never thought that sorghum could be planted in Grape Valley. Rouzi Haili broke this superstition."

　　Earlier this year, after the county party committee issued a call to take grain as the key link and strive for self-sufficiency in grain in economic crop areas, Rouzi Haili had this idea in his mind: if some sorghum could be planted on the open space around the grape mounds, Grape Valley could increase several hundred mu of grain crops out of thin air! But when he thought that no one had grown grain here for hundreds of years, his confidence wavered. At an enlarged meeting of the county party committee, he expressed his thoughts and unexpectedly received great attention from the responsible comrades of the county party committee, who believed this was a bold attempt. Rouzi Haili’s confidence was now strengthened. He rushed back to Grape Valley that night and worked with the general branch committee members to draw up a plan for planting sorghum. But when he put forward this plan at the meeting of all cadres in the management area, some people opposed doing so, thinking that the farmers of Grape Valley had never grown crops, had no experience, and if things went wrong, not only would their work be wasted, but even the seeds would be lost; secondly, there were many pebbles in the vineyard, and nothing would grow. But most people advocated giving it a try. The next day after the meeting, Rouzi Haili borrowed more than a thousand jin of sorghum seeds from nearby management areas and immediately started planting. This time, because the masses had no experience in growing grain, some planted too deep and some too shallow, and few seedlings emerged. But Rouzi Haili was not discouraged, and discussed remedial measures with old farmers and activists every day, and went to nearby brigades that grew grain to ask for advice.

　　One day, when he passed the Communist Youth League Brigade of the Five-Star Commune, he saw that they were thinning out seedlings, and the pulled sorghum seedlings were piled all over the ground, green and lush. Suddenly his eyes lit up, and he thought that if these seedlings were transplanted, it would save seeds and grow faster. He found the captain of the Communist Youth League Brigade and asked in detail whether transplanting seedlings was feasible. He was told that it was possible, but Grape Valley was more than ten miles away, and the seedlings would wither if the time was too long. He was extremely happy, took off his coat at that time, wrapped a bundle of seedlings with soil, and hurried home, and found several old farmers to plant the sorghum in the vineyard behind the management area office. For the first two days, the seedlings drooped listlessly, and he checked several times a day, watering them on time, and even checking them one by one with a match at night. On the third day, the small sorghum seedlings straightened up, their leaves spreading to both sides, and finally survived. The news of the successful planting of sorghum spread like wind throughout Grape Valley, and the masses were very excited, demanding to transplant seedlings in all the vineyards. Rouzi Haili convened a mass meeting that night to arrange the planting tasks. The five brigades in the entire management area organized a seedling transplanting team of more than three hundred people, and dispatched seventy-one donkeys and more than a dozen carts to transport seedlings to the Communist Youth League Brigade. He himself led people to Yangshaer Management Area, twenty or thirty miles away, and took the initiative to help people thin out seedlings. The seedlings were transported back for planting. In order to save time, the people who transported them transported them as soon as they were pulled out, and the people who planted them planted them as soon as they arrived. On the several main roads leading to Grape Valley, the transport teams flew non-stop. Rouzi Haili drove a donkey more than a hundred miles a day, and also had to go to each team to check the planting situation at night. For three whole days, on the open space above and below Grape Valley and on the canal banks, without using a single seed, two million eight hundred thousand sorghum plants were planted, which was equivalent to adding more than four hundred mu of sorghum out of thin air.

　　 Office in the Field
　　If someone visiting Rouzi Haili goes to the management area office to look for him, the commune members will look at you with a surprised expression: "This must be your first time here! His office is in the field!" The management area secretary told us that except for receiving guests, he rarely stays in the office, and most of the meetings in the management area are held in the fields. Rouzi Haili said well: "Grapes grow in the fields, commune members work in the fields, and a leader must discover and solve problems in a timely manner. How can that be done without going to the fields?" His arranged time is: squatting down to work during the day, and mobile inspection in the evening. Usually, he does not walk the main roads but walks the mountain ditches. He remembers clearly every secluded path buried in the grape bushes. The hundreds of vineyards scattered in Grape Valley, which piece of land has not been weeded, which piece of land has not been built with frames, none of them can escape his eyes. More than one hundred cadres above the level of production team leader in the entire management area regard Rouzi Haili as their model, going deep into the fields and working with the masses.

　　The commune members of Leyuan Brigade had been thinking for several years about reclaiming a piece of wasteland on the hillside, but they could not open it because they could not get water to it. After Rouzi Haili arrived at Leyuan Brigade, he attached great importance to this issue and ran to the wasteland to check it out. The wasteland is located in a semi-mountain depression, the land is flat, and the soil is fertile, with a full five or six hundred mu. Why can't water be brought in? A local commune member told him that the terrain here was higher than the water source, and water could not flow upwards. This sentence aroused Rouzi Haili's attention. The next day, he invited several commune members with experience in digging karez wells and climbed along the hillside leading to the wasteland towards the water source, and found an abandoned old canal, the canal bed was lower than the wasteland, so the water could not flow up. He carefully measured and calculated with a ruler, and finally figured out that the source was not lower than the wasteland, but there was a depression in the middle, and the water level dropped when it flowed here. Old farmer Mu Quanmaiti suggested leveling this depression so that the canal bed would be as high as the wasteland, and the water could flow to the wasteland. After Rouzi Haili discussed with the brigade party branch, he decided to adopt this method. He and the commune members lived on the construction site, worked day and night, and in less than seven days, a new canal was built. Spring water crossed the mountain depression and flowed to the fertile wasteland. Now this piece of wasteland has become a big melon garden, and the melons that grow are big and sweet.

　　The Intimate of the Masses
　　In January this year, in order to establish a grain base, the management area decided to reclaim wasteland and build water conservancy at Laoshuquan, twenty miles away from Grape Valley, before the spring, and mobilize several hundred laborers to camp in the wilderness. The weather was cold and freezing, and the food and lodging of the masses was a big problem. Rouzi Haili, who had just returned from a meeting in the county, thought of these problems and did not stop at home, but led a dozen carpenters and bricklayers to the construction site in advance to build field dormitories for the commune members. As soon as he arrived at the construction site, he took off his cotton coat and immediately took the lead in working. At night, they slept in the open on the hillside. During breaks, he also ran to the mountains to cut grass and firewood to prepare for the commune members to keep warm. When a large number of reclamation workers came to the construction site, the warm houses, warm kang beds, and cafeterias were all built, and a construction site bathhouse was also built. The commune members touched the hot kang beds and looked at the general branch secretary's frostbitten hands, and said with emotion: "Even our relatives would not think of us so thoughtfully."

　　Rouzi Haili always kept in mind the working method put forward by the Party of "grasping both production and caring about the lives of the masses." The five hundred households and three thousand people in the entire management area, whose family had birth, old age, illness, or death, were all on his mind. When he went to the team to check production, he also went deep into the homes of the commune members to visit and helped the commune members solve their difficulties in life at any time. Once, Rouzi Haili found that Jimulat, who usually loved to joke, looked worried, so he asked him what was on his mind. It turned out that Jimulat's child was sick and he was worried and had no way to deal with it. Rouzi Haili comforted him and left. In the evening, when Jimulat returned home, as soon as he entered the door, he saw a doctor sitting in front of the bed examining the child. His wife told him that Rouzi Haili had personally gone to the hospital to ask for a doctor for the child, and also went to the bank to withdraw his own savings and sent them to them. Jimulat felt a burst of warmth in his heart after hearing this, and was so moved that he could not speak.

　　Rouzi Haili grew up in Grape Valley. Before liberation, he and the poor brothers in Grape Valley fled famine together and worked as cattle and horses under the whips of landlords together. After liberation, he led the masses to turn themselves over and engage in production, creating a better life. He established a flesh-and-blood relationship with the masses, loved the masses, and cared about the masses. On the water conservancy construction site, he worked like the commune members during the day, and also had to walk through all the dormitories at night to cover the commune members with quilts and add coal to the stoves. Once, the boots of the young man Wulemaiyite, who was working, broke, revealing his feet. When Rouzi Haili saw this, he immediately gave the felt boots he had just bought to Wulemaiyite and wore single shoes himself. After Wulemaiyite's old mother saw this, she said to everyone she met: "Secretary Rouzi knows our hearts best!"

　　群众的贴心人肉孜海力
　　新华社记者　谈风
    肉孜海力是吐鲁番县葡萄公社葡萄沟管理区的党总支书记。我们还在县委和公社党委时，就听到人们对他的评语：“肉孜海力对党交给的一切任务，从不叫一声苦，不道一个‘难’字，总是紧紧依靠群众，勇敢地战胜困难，完成任务”。至于葡萄沟的维吾尔农民们更喜欢用这样的话语来称颂他们的党总支书记：“共产党领导我们走上了幸福的路，肉孜海力引着大家跨过了路上的沟！”肉孜海力担任管理区总支书记两年多来，始终兢兢业业，埋头为党和群众工作，使葡萄沟变成了真正幸福的山沟。
    “没有种子的高粱”
    一跨进葡萄沟口，一个新奇的景象立刻吸引住我们：在藤蔓交错的葡萄园里，像繁星似的生长着一丛一丛高粱，秆子粗得像胳膊，沉重的穗子压弯了腰，真是难得的好庄稼。我们到葡萄沟访问时，乐园大队队长一见面就对我们说：“我活了四十多年也没想到在葡萄沟能栽高粱，肉孜海力硬是打破了这个迷信。”
    今年初，当县委提出以粮为纲，争取经济作物区实现粮食自给的号召后，肉孜海力脑子里就转着这个念头：如果能在葡萄墩周围空地上种点高粱，全葡萄沟就能平空增加几百亩粮食作物！但当他想到几百年来没人在这里种粮时，信心就动摇了。在一次县委扩大会议上，他说出了自己的想法，想不到受到了县委负责同志的极大重视，认为这是一个大胆的尝试。肉孜海力这下子坚定了信心，他当晚赶回葡萄沟，和总支委员们拟订了点种高粱的计划。但当他在管理区全体干部会议上提出这个计划时，有些人反对这样作，认为葡萄沟的农民祖辈没种过庄稼，没经验，搞不好不但白费工，连种子也赔进去了；其次是葡萄园里卵石多，长不出来。但是大多数人都主张试试看。会议第二天，肉孜海力向附近管理区借来了一千多斤高粱种子，马上开始了点种工作。这次点种由于群众没有种粮经验，有的深，有的浅，苗出的很少。但肉孜海力并不灰心，天天同老农、积极分子商量补救的办法，向附近种粮的大队去请教。
    有一天，他走过五星公社共青团大队时，看到他们正在间苗，拔掉的高粱苗绿油油地堆满一地。突然他眼睛一亮，心想要是把这些苗子栽种上，又省种子，又长得快。他找到共青团大队大队长，详细打听移苗行不行？人家告诉他说，可以，只是葡萄沟离这里有十多里路，时间一长，苗就会枯死。他高兴极了，当时脱下外衣包了一捆带土的苗子往家紧赶，又找到几个老农，把高粱栽在管理区办公室后面的葡萄园里。头两天，苗子无精打彩地低着头，他一天查看好几次，按时浇水，夜里还划着火柴一棵一棵查看。第三天，小高粱苗挺直了腰杆，叶子向两边舒展，终于成活了。栽高粱成功的消息像风一样传遍了葡萄沟，群众非常兴奋，要求在所有葡萄园里移种。肉孜海力当晚就召开了群众大会，布置了栽种任务。全管理区五个大队组织了三百多人的移苗队，抽出七十一头驴和十几辆大车，到共青团大队运苗，他自己带着人到二、三十里外的洋沙尔管理区，主动帮助人家间苗，间下的苗子运回来栽。为了争取时间，运的人随拔随运，种的人随到随栽，在通往葡萄沟的几条大路上，运输队川流不息地飞跑着。肉孜海力赶着毛驴一天跑一百多里，晚上还要到各队检查栽种情况。整整三天，在葡萄沟上上下下的空地上、渠坎上，没用一粒种子，栽上了二百八十万株高粱，等于平空增加了四百多亩高粱。
            办公室在地里
    访问肉孜海力的人，如果到管理区办公室去找他，社员就会用惊奇的神色打量你一番：“你是头次来吧！他的办公室在地里！”管理区秘书告诉我们，除了接待客人，他很少在办公室，管理区的大部分会议都是在地头开的。肉孜海力说的好：“葡萄长在田间，社员劳动在田间，一个领导人要及时发现和解决问题，不到田间怎么行？”他给自己安排的时间是：白天蹲点劳动，傍晚流动检查，平时他不走大道走山沟，埋在葡萄丛中的每条僻静小路他都记得清清楚楚，散布在葡萄沟中的数百个葡萄园，那块没拔草，那块没搭架，都逃不开他的眼睛。全管理区一百多名生产小队长以上的干部都把肉孜海力当作自己的榜样，深入田间，和群众一起劳动。
    乐园大队的社员们思谋了几年要开垦山腰里一块荒地，但因为引不上水去没有开成。肉孜海力到乐园大队后，很重视这个问题，就跑到荒地去查看。荒地座落在半山洼里，地又平，土又肥，足有五、六百亩。为什么引不上水呢？当地的一个社员告诉他说，这里地势高过了水源，水不能往上流。这句话引起了肉孜海力的注意。第二天，他约了几个挖坎儿井有经验的社员，沿着通到荒地的山坡，向水源处爬去，发现有一条废弃不用的旧渠，渠身比荒地低，所以水流不上去。他细心地用尺子测量、计算，终于弄清源头并不比荒地低，只是中间有一段凹地、水流到这里降低了水平。老农穆全买提建议把这段凹地垫平，让渠身和荒地一样高，水就可以流到荒地。肉孜海力和大队党支部商量后，决定采纳这个办法。他和社员一道住在工地，日夜奋战，不到七天，一条新渠道便修成了。泉水越过山凹，流到了肥沃的荒地上。现在这块荒地已经变成了大瓜园，长的瓜又大又甜。
        群众的贴心人
    今年元月间，管理区为了建立粮食基地，决定赶在开春前，在离葡萄沟二十里外的老鼠泉开荒修水利，要动员几百名劳力在旷野里安营扎寨。天寒地冻，群众的吃住是个大问题。刚从县上开会回来的肉孜海力想到这些问题之后，没在家里落脚，便带领十几个木匠和瓦匠，提前到工地为社员修建野外宿舍。一到工地，他把棉衣脱下，立刻带头干起来。晚上，他们就露宿在山坡上，休息时间，他还跑到山上砍草打柴，准备为社员取暖用。当大批开荒人员来到工地的时候，暖屋、暖炕和食堂都修好了，还修建了一个工地澡堂。社员们用手摸着烧得滚热的炕，看着总支书记冻裂的双手，感动地说：“就是亲人也不会为我们想得这样周到。”
    肉孜海力始终牢记着党提出的“既要抓生产，又要关心群众生活”的工作方法，全管理区五百多户人家、三千人，那家发生生老病痛，都在他心里装着。他到小队去检查生产的时候，还深入到社员家里去访问，随时帮助社员解决生活上的困难。有一次，肉孜海力发现平时爱说笑的吉木拉特面带愁容，就问他有什么心事。原来吉木拉特的孩子生了病，正愁得没办法，肉孜海力安慰他一番就走了。晚上，当吉木拉特回到家时，一进门，看见一个医生正坐在床前给孩子看病，妻子告诉他，肉孜海力亲自到医院为孩子请来了医生，又到银行取出自己的存款给他们送了来。吉木拉特听了心里一阵热烘烘的，感动得说不出话来。
    肉孜海力生长在葡萄沟，解放前，他和葡萄沟的穷苦兄弟一起逃过荒，一起在地主的鞭子下当过牛马；解放后，他又领导群众一起翻身闹生产，创造了美好的生活，他和群众建立了血肉般的关系，热爱群众，关心群众。在水利工地上，他白天和社员一样劳动，晚上还要走遍所有的宿舍，为社员盖被子、添炉子。有一次，正在劳动中的小伙子吾勒玛衣特的靴子坏了，露出了脚，被肉孜海力看到了，他立刻把刚买的毡靴给了吾勒玛衣特，自己穿单鞋。吾勒玛衣特的老母亲看到这件事后，逢人便说：“肉孜书记最知道我们的心！”
