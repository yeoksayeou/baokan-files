On the afternoon of September 1st, an exciting piece of good news came from the Mengzhuiwan swimming pool in Chengdu: Athlete Mo Guoxiong broke the world record of 1 minute 11.1 seconds for the men's 100-meter breaststroke, previously held by Chinese athlete Mu Xiangxiong, with an excellent time of 1 minute 11 seconds.

On this day, colorful flags fluttered in the swimming pool, and more than 4,000 spectators intently watched the shimmering competition pool. As the starter's gun fired, eight athletes agilely jumped into the water. Mo Guoxiong was in the middle, swimming in the fifth lane. At the beginning, the eight were almost neck and neck. But after swimming fifteen meters, Mo Guoxiong's arm strokes gradually became more powerful, and his speed increased, suddenly surpassing the other athletes by a head. When he reached the 50-meter mark, he had only used 33 seconds.

As Mo Guoxiong swam back, he first lightly stroked his arms, and then mustered all his strength to move forward quickly. At this time, he had already left the other athletes behind by more than three seconds, and the audience applauded and cheered. Mo Guoxiong swam faster and faster, rushing straight to the finish line. As soon as his fingers touched the pool wall at the finish line, three referees simultaneously stopped their stopwatches. All three stopwatches stopped at 1 minute 11 seconds. This showed that the athletes of New China had once again broken a world record.

Before the announcer could report, the audience had already anticipated the good news from the referees' tense and excited actions and expressions, and began to applaud. When the announcer reported the good news, the whole place erupted in a roar. At this time, Mi Jianshu, Secretary of the Chengdu Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China and Deputy Mayor of Chengdu, Xia Xiang, Vice Chairman of the Chinese Swimming Association, and the heads of the Sichuan Provincial and Chengdu Municipal Sports Commissions walked down from the rostrum to congratulate Mo Guoxiong. Three young Pioneers presented flowers to Mo Guoxiong. The cheers and applause grew louder and louder.

Outside the swimming pool, a group of athletes had been waiting for him. World record holder Mu Xiangxiong embraced him and said: Congratulations on breaking the world record, I hope you will achieve even better results! At this time, Mo Guoxiong just hugged him tightly, too excited to speak.

Breaking the world record and winning honor for the motherland has been Mo Guoxiong's long-held wish. Today, this wish has finally come true, how could he not be excited!

Mo Guoxiong was originally a child from a poor family in Guangdong, whose home was near a small river. He liked to swim when he was seven or eight years old. However, his achievements in swimming were entirely obtained after liberation through the Party's cultivation and education, and after years of hard training.

When Mo Guoxiong participated in the National Swimming Competition in Shanghai in August 1955, although he won the third place in the men's 100-meter breaststroke, his best result at that time was only 1 minute 20.8 seconds. Later, whether it was the cold winter or the windy and rainy days, he took time out for training almost every day. In 1958, he injured his leg, and it would hurt if he exercised too vigorously. But this did not stop him. He often engaged in auxiliary activities such as weightlifting, dumbbells, and pole climbing to strengthen his arm strength to compensate for his leg strength.

In this way, his performance improved rapidly. When he participated in the National First-Class and Master-Class Spring Swimming Competition in April 1959, his 100-meter breaststroke result had reached 1 minute 13.8 seconds, exceeding the 1 minute 14 second standard for master athletes. From then on, a lofty wish often encouraged him. He was determined to move towards the world record. Whenever he gathered with other outstanding athletes, he would carefully observe and learn from others' strengths, and humbly listen to others' advice. In the National First-Class and Master-Class Spring Swimming and Diving Championships in May of this year, his 100-meter breaststroke result was further shortened to 1 minute 12.2 seconds. More than three months later, he finally broke the world record and realized his wish.

When people warmly congratulated Mo Guoxiong, he humbly said: All this is thanks to the Party. I must create more and better results and win greater honor for the Party and the people.

    为祖国争取荣誉
    ——莫国雄打破男子百米蛙泳世界纪录
    新华社记者　周祖佑　李世义
    9月1日下午，从成都猛追湾泳游场里传出一个震动人心的好消息：运动健将莫国雄以一分十一秒的优异成绩，打破了我国运动健将穆祥雄保持的男子一百米蛙泳一分十一秒一的世界纪录。
    这天，游泳场里彩旗招展，四千多名观众聚精会神地凝望着碧波荡漾的比赛池。发令员枪声一响，八名运动员敏捷地跳入水中。莫国雄居中，游在第五泳道。开始，八人几乎齐头并进。但游了十五米后，莫国雄双手划动逐步有力，速度加快了，一下子超出其他运动员一头。游到五十米处时，他只用了三十三秒的时间。
    莫国雄往回游时，他先是轻快地划动手臂，然后就鼓足力气向前疾进。这时，他已把其他运动员拉下三秒多时间，全场观众纷纷鼓掌、欢呼。而莫国雄也越游越快，直向终点冲去。当他的手指刚触到终点的池壁，三个裁判员同时按停了秒表。三个秒表都停在一分十一秒的地方。这表明，新中国的运动员又一次打破了世界纪录。
    没等广播员报告，观众们从裁判员们紧张兴奋的动作和神情中，已经预料到将要传出的喜讯，纷纷鼓起掌来。当广播员报告了这个喜讯后，全场更是一片沸腾。这时，中共成都市委书记、成都市副市长米建书，中国游泳协会副主席夏翔，以及四川省和成都市体育运动委员会的负责人走下主席台，向莫国雄祝贺。三个女少先队员向莫国雄献花。人们欢呼、鼓掌越来越热烈。
    在游泳池外，一群运动员早已等待着他。世界纪录保持者穆祥雄双手把他拥抱起来，对他说：祝贺你打破了世界纪录，希望你创造更好的成绩！这时，莫国雄只是紧紧地拥抱着他，激动得说不出话来。
    突破世界纪录，为祖国争取荣誉，这已经是莫国雄长久以来的愿望。今天，这个愿望终于实现了，他怎么能不兴奋呢！
    莫国雄原来是广东一个穷苦家庭的孩子，家靠近一条小河。他七、八岁时，就喜欢游泳。但是，他在游泳方面的成就，完全是解放后经过党的培养和教育，以及他多年刻苦锻炼后才获得的。
    莫国雄1955年8月在上海参加全国游泳竞赛大会时，虽然获得了男子一百米蛙泳的第三名，但当时最好的成绩只达到一分二十秒八。后来，他无论严寒的冬季，或是刮风下雨的日子，差不多每天都要抽出时间进行锻炼。1958年他腿部受过伤，运动过猛就会疼痛。但是这并没有难住他，他经常进行举重、哑铃、爬竿等辅助活动，锻炼臂力，以补足腿力。
    这样，他的成绩提高很快。1959年4月参加全国一级、健将级春季游泳比赛时，百米蛙泳的成绩已达到一分十三秒八，超过了一分十四秒的运动健将标准。从那时起，一个崇高的愿望就经常鼓舞着他。他决心向世界纪录前进。只要与其他优秀运动员聚会在一起，他就要细致地观察和学习别人的长处，虚心地听取别人的指教。在今年5月的全国一级、健将级春季游泳、跳水锦标赛中，他的一百米蛙泳成绩又缩短为一分十二秒二。三个多月后，他终于打破了世界最高纪录，实现了自己的愿望。
    当人们向莫国雄热烈祝贺的时候，他谦逊地说：这一切都归功于党。我一定要创造出更多更好的成绩，为党和人民争得更大荣誉。
