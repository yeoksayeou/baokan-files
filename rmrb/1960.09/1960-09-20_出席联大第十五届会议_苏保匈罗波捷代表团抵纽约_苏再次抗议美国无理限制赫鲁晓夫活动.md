Xinhua News Agency, September 19th dispatch: TASS, New York, September 19th dispatch: The Soviet delegation to the 15th session of the United Nations General Assembly, led by Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, Khrushchev, arrived in New York today aboard the "Baltika" turbo-electric ship.

The Bulgarian delegation to the 15th UN General Assembly, led by Zhivkov, the Hungarian delegation led by Kadar, and the Romanian delegation led by Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej, also arrived in New York on the same ship as Khrushchev.

The delegations of the Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic, led by Podgorny, and the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic, led by Mazurov, also arrived on the same ship.

Xinhua News Agency, September 19th dispatch: New York news: The Polish delegation, led by Gomulka, a member of the Polish Council of State, and the Czechoslovak delegation, led by President Novotny of Czechoslovakia, arrived in New York yesterday on the same plane to attend the 15th session of the United Nations General Assembly, scheduled to open on the 20th.

Xinhua News Agency, September 18th dispatch: TASS, Moscow, September 16th dispatch: The Soviet government has issued a reply to the note from the US State Department to the Soviet government on September 13th. The aforementioned US note was in response to the Soviet government's protest against the US government's unreasonable restrictions on the scope of activities of Khrushchev, head of the Soviet delegation to the 15th session of the United Nations General Assembly. In the note, the US government persisted in its illegal decision.

In its reply to the US government, the Soviet government stated that it could not agree with the US arguments regarding the restrictions and expressed regret that the US government still adhered to the hostile stance it had maintained on the eve of the Four-Power Summit in Paris, when its aim was to attempt to sabotage the meeting or, in the event that such a meeting did take place, to create conditions in the negotiations that would make a beneficial outcome impossible.

The Soviet government stated that the US government must bear full responsibility for the tense atmosphere during the UN General Assembly session.

According to Western news agencies, while insisting on restricting the scope of Khrushchev's activities during his attendance at the UN General Assembly, the US State Department has also put pressure on US television companies, radio stations, and newspapers to limit the broadcast of his speeches during Khrushchev's stay in the United States.

    苏保匈罗波捷代表团抵纽约
    苏再次抗议美国无理限制赫鲁晓夫活动
    据新华社19日讯　据塔斯社纽约19日讯：出席联合国大会第十五届会议的苏联代表团在苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫率领下在今天乘“波罗的海号”透平电动机船到达纽约。
    由日夫科夫率领的出席联大第十五届会议的保加利亚代表团、卡达尔率领的匈牙利代表团、乔治乌—德治率领的罗马尼亚代表团，也和赫鲁晓夫乘同一条船到达纽约。
    同船到达的还有由波德戈尔内率领的白俄罗斯共和国代表团和马祖罗夫率领的乌克兰共和国代表团。
    新华社19日讯　纽约消息：由波兰国务委员会委员哥穆尔卡率领的波兰代表团和捷克斯洛伐克总统诺沃提尼率领的捷克斯洛伐克代表团在昨天同机到达纽约，出席定于20日开幕的联合国大会第十五届会议。
    据新华社18日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科16日讯：苏联政府就美国国务院9月13日给苏联政府的一份照会提出复照。美国的上述照会，是回答苏联政府抗议美国政府无理限制苏联出席联合国大会第十五届会议的代表团团长赫鲁晓夫的活动范围的照会的，美国政府在照会中坚持它的非法决定。
    苏联政府在给美国政府的复照中说，苏联政府不能同意美国关于限制的论据，并表示遗憾，因为美国政府仍然坚持它在巴黎四国政府首脑会晤前夕所坚持过的敌对立场，那时，它的目的是企图破坏会晤，或者在这种会晤一旦举行的情况下，在谈判中制造使会晤不可能得到有益结果的条件。
    苏联政府声明，美国政府要对联合国大会工作期间的紧张状态负全部责任。
    据西方通讯社报道，在坚持限制赫鲁晓夫在出席联大期间的活动范围的同时，美国国务院还对美国的电视公司、无线电电台和报馆施加压力，要它们在赫鲁晓夫在美国逗留期间限制发播他的演说。
