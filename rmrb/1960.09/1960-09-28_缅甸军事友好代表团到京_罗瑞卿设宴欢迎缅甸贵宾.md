Xinhua News Agency, September 27th: General Luo Ruiqing, Chief of General Staff of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, held a banquet in the Xinjiang Hall of the Great Hall of the People this afternoon to warmly welcome all members of the Burmese military friendship delegation, headed by Brigadier General Maung Maung, who are visiting our country.

At the banquet, General Luo Ruiqing, on behalf of the Chinese people and all commanders and fighters of the People's Liberation Army, extended a warm welcome to the distinguished guests of the Burmese military friendship delegation headed by Brigadier General Maung Maung. He said that in the past, the people of our two countries waged a heroic struggle against the enslavement and oppression of imperialism and colonialism. Since the independence of Burma and the liberation of our country, the premiers of our two countries, based on the sincere and friendly wishes of the people of both countries, jointly advocated the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence between countries with different social systems, and developed friendly relations in all aspects between our two countries. Now, on the basis of this principle, and in the spirit of mutual understanding and mutual concession, our two countries have successfully resolved the long-standing and difficult boundary issues left over from history, which has not only had a profound impact on the people of our two countries, but also set an example for solidarity and friendship between Asian countries.

General Luo Ruiqing said that the Burmese Armed Forces have written their own glorious history in the struggle to win national independence and oppose imperialist aggression. The Chinese people and army have always been concerned about and attached importance to your heroic struggle to defend national independence and oppose imperialist aggression. The armies of our two countries also embody the sincere desire for peace and friendship of the governments and peoples of the two countries, and are constantly conducting close and friendly exchanges. We are particularly excited that General Ne Win and General Aung Gyi have visited our country several times this year and have made outstanding efforts to build the edifice of peace and friendship between China and Burma. Thanks to the joint efforts of our two countries, the friendly relations between China and Burma have been greatly developed, and the people of our two countries enthusiastically praise this year as the China-Burma Friendship Year. We believe that this visit of the Burmese military friendship delegation to our country, laden with the "pauk-phaw" (fraternal) friendship of the Burmese people and army, will make new contributions to further enhancing the friendship and understanding between the people and armies of our two countries.

Brigadier General Maung Maung said at the banquet that this is the second visit of the Burmese military friendship delegation to China. Leaders and other delegations from Burma and China have made many mutual friendly visits in recent years, which fully demonstrates the friendly and respectful relationship between our two countries. This friendly relationship is the result of the hard work of the leaders of the two countries, and the result of the friendly wishes of mutual concession and mutual understanding between our two countries and peoples.

Brigadier General Maung Maung said that it is very gratifying that the border issue between Burma and China will soon be resolved peacefully and amicably. He said that when the peoples and countries of Burma and China have such a good friendship, the armies of the two countries are naturally very friendly, and this friendship is always extremely beneficial and valuable.

Finally, Brigadier General Maung Maung raised his glass and toasted the eternal friendship between the peoples of Burma and China.

Among those present at the banquet were Senior General Xiao Hua, Senior General Zhang Aiping, Lieutenant General Xiao Xiangrong, Lieutenant General Li Zuopeng, Lieutenant General Yang Xiushan, Lieutenant General Zhang Lingbin, Vice Admiral Zhou Xihan, Vice Admiral Xu Shenji, Lieutenant General Liu Jinxuan, Lieutenant General Han Wei, Lieutenant General Kuang Yumin, Major General Lin Bin, Major General Sun Chaoqun, Rear Admiral Zhang Xuesi, Air Force Major General He Tingyi, Major General Jia Ruoyu and other senior generals of the Chinese People's Liberation Army.
