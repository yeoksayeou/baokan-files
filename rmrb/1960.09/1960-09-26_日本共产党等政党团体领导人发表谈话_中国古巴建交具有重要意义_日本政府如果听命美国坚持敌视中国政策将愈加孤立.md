Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, September 25th: Leaders of the Japanese Communist Party, the Socialist Party, and the Japan Peace Committee have welcomed the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and Cuba, pointing out that this has important significance.

　　Anzai Kuri, Central Committee Member and Secretary-General of the Secretariat of the Japanese Communist Party, said on the 25th that this event means that the conspiracy of U.S. imperialism to exclude China from international political life has once again suffered a disastrous defeat. He pointed out that Cuba is a country in Latin America, which demonstrates the important significance of the establishment of diplomatic relations between Cuba and China.

　　Anzai emphasized that the demand for China to obtain its rightful position in international politics has become a worldwide trend. He said that if the Japanese government continues to listen to the United States, participate in the conspiracy to create "two Chinas," and persist in a policy of hostility towards China, it will make Japan increasingly isolated in international politics.

　　Asanuma Inejirō, Chairman of the Japan Socialist Party, said that the establishment of diplomatic relations between Cuba and China is a very gratifying event. He stated that the Japan Socialist Party will work to promote the restoration of diplomatic relations between the Japanese government and China.

　　Hirano Yoshitaro, Chairman of the Japan Peace Committee, pointed out that the establishment of formal diplomatic relations between China and Cuba, who are engaged in a common struggle against U.S. imperialism, has further consolidated the friendly relations between the two countries. This has set a valuable example for countries and nations around the world that are fighting for national independence and peace.

　　中国古巴建交具有重要意义
    日本政府如果听命美国坚持敌视中国政策将愈加孤立
    新华社25日讯　东京消息：日本共产党、社会党、日本和平委员会领导人表示欢迎中国同古巴建立外交关系，并指出这具有重要意义。
    日本共产党中央委员、书记局书记安斋库治25日发表谈话说，这件事情意味着美帝国主义企图从国际政治生活中排除中国的阴谋又一次遭到惨重失败。他指出，古巴是中南美洲的国家，这表明了古巴中国建交的重要意义。
    安斋强调指出，使中国在国际政治中取得应得地位这种要求，已经成为全世界的潮流。他说，如果日本政府仍然听命于美国，参加制造“两个中国”的阴谋，坚持敌视中国的政策，将会使日本在国际政治中愈加陷于孤立。
    日本社会党委员长浅沼稻次郎说，古巴同中国建交是非常值得欢欣的。他表示，日本社会党要为促使日本政府同中国恢复邦交而努力。
    日本和平委员会理事长平野义太郎指出，为反对美帝国主义而进行着共同斗争的中国和古巴两国建立正式外交关系，进一步巩固了两国的友好关系。这为世界上争取民族独立、和平而进行着斗争的国家、民族树立了宝贵的榜样。
