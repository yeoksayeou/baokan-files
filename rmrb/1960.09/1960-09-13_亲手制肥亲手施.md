　　Making Fertilizer with Our Own Hands, Applying It with Our Own Hands

　　After studying the People's Daily editorial "The Whole Party Mobilizes, The Whole People Mobilizes, Vigorously Develop Agriculture, Vigorously Develop Grain Production," the employees of the Donglu Management District Chemical Fertilizer Plant in Dongzhen Commune, Wenxi County, Shanxi Province, began to discuss it. Plant Director Wang Zhengquan gave everyone a question: can we, while ensuring the completion of fertilizer production tasks, allocate some labor to directly participate in agricultural production? Old worker Gao Zhongkui said: "As long as we find a way to reform our tools and do two days' work in one day, we can guarantee over-fulfillment of production tasks and also allocate labor to support agricultural production." A weak link in the fertilizer plant was that the bone boiling couldn't keep up with demand, so we had to think of something for the bone-boiling pot. The workers used their lunch break to convert the original small pot into a large pot, built a large stove, and installed three large pots in a row. The efficiency of bone boiling was increased by more than two times, and the daily output of fertilizer increased from 3,000 catties to 10,000 catties. The management district has more than 30 mu of late corn that needs topdressing, so the fertilizer plant contracted this task. The workers, carrying the potassium chloride produced by their own plant, completed the topdressing task in one day. The fertilizer made by the workers with their own hands and applied to the cornfields with their own hands, truly made them feel indescribably happy.

    亲手制肥亲手施
    山西闻喜县东镇公社东鲁管理区化学肥料厂的职工，学习了人民日报“全党动手、全民动手，大办农业、大办粮食”的社论以后，大家就议论开了。厂长王正全给大家出了个题目：能不能在保证完成生产肥料任务的前提下，抽调出一部分劳力直接参加农业生产。老工人高中奎说：“我们只要想办法把工具改革一下，一天干出两天的活，保证超额完成生产任务，还能抽调劳力支援农业生产。”化肥厂的一个薄弱环节是煮骨头赶不上用，必须在煮骨头用的锅上想点子。工人们利用午间休息时间，把原来的小锅改成了大锅，砌了一个大炉子，一排安了三个大锅。煮骨头的效率提高了二倍多，每天出产化肥的数量由三千斤提高到一万斤。管理区有三十多亩晚玉米需要追肥，化肥厂就把这个任务包下来，工人带着本厂出产的氯化钾，一天就完成了追肥任务。工人们亲手制造的肥料，又亲手施在玉米田里，真有说不出的高兴。
