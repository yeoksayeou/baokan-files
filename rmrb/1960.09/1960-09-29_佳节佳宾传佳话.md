Oh, this is a fine time with beautiful scenery, gentle breeze, and a bright sun. The peacocks spread their tails in your forests so beautifully, and our fireworks bloom like golden chrysanthemums in the sky. The moon is especially bright at Mid-Autumn Festival, and the wild geese arrive just in time as honored guests. The Chinese and Burmese people are "Pauk Phaw" (亲兄弟) (close brothers), and we welcome relatives during this festive season. Let us sing our common songs: Long live peace and friendship! China and Burma are neighbors with a shared fence. We plant rose branches together by the fence. Mutual understanding and concession are like sunshine and rain, sprinkling red flowers fragrant in both lands… Welcome, welcome our relatives. Let us hold up the treasure umbrella together (Note 1): the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. Let us build the edifice of friendship together, the ribbon-cutting ceremony is about to begin (Note 2). Honey is sweet, friendship is good. On the day we sign the border treaty, you will send salt and rice (Note 3), these are beautiful things created by labor, symbolizing the friendship we need from each other. Honey is sweet, friendship is good. On the day we exchange the instruments of ratification for the border treaty, we will send you printed cloth and porcelain plates (Note 4), the printed cloth weaves our hearts, the porcelain plates write our friendship. We love your art: your silver-bell dance steps echo the whistle of white doves in our sky; your bamboo clappers and strings flow into poetry with the sound of the commune's machines on our peaceful land… Long live peace and friendship, we shake hands and become brothers. We have all suffered at the hands of imperialism. Now we are liberated, you are independent. Construction needs peace, like plowing needs land. Peace needs to be defended, unity is friendship. Let those who piece together aggressive blocs run into a wall here! Let those who create division become our mortal enemies! China and Burma are "Pauk Phaw," setting a new example of peaceful coexistence for Asian countries.

(Note 2) Premier Zhou Enlai compared Premier U Nu's visit this time to coming to cut the ribbon for the completion ceremony of the China-Burma friendship building.

(Note 3) The Joint Communique of the Governments of China and Burma stated: "On the same day as the signing of the boundary treaty, the Burmese government will, through officials designated by the Chinese government, present two thousand tons of rice and one thousand tons of salt to approximately one million Chinese residents living near the China-Burma border."

(Note 4) The Joint Communique of the Governments of China and Burma stated: "On the same day as the exchange of instruments of ratification of the border treaty, the Chinese government will, through officials designated by the Burmese government, present two million four hundred thousand meters of printed cloth and six hundred thousand porcelain plates to approximately one million two hundred thousand Burmese residents living near the China-Burma border."

　　佳节佳宾传佳话
　　邹荻帆噢，这是良辰美景，风和日丽。你们的树林上孔雀开屏多美丽，我们的天空上焰火灿放金钱菊。月到中秋分外明，鸿雁来宾正当时。中缅人民是“胞波”（亲兄弟），佳节又逢迎亲戚，唱我们共同的歌曲啊，万岁，和平和友谊！中缅相邻一道篱，篱边我们共种玫瑰枝。互谅互让是阳光和雨水，雨洒花红香两地……欢迎，欢迎啊，欢迎我们的亲戚。我们来共撑起宝伞（注一）：五项原则，和平共处。我们来共建友好大厦，剪彩典礼正在开始（注二）。甜的是蜂蜜，好的是友谊。在签订边界条约那一天，你们将送来食盐和大米（注三），这是劳动创造的美好的东西，它象征我们彼此需要的友谊。甜的是蜂蜜，好的是友谊。在互换边界条约批准书那天，我们将送上花布和瓷盘（注四），花布织我们的心意，瓷盘写我们的友谊。我们爱你们的艺术：你们摇响银铃的舞步，跟我们天空白鸽的哨音答语；你们的竹板和琴弦，跟我们和平的土地上公社的机器声汇流成诗……万岁，和平和友谊，我们握手结兄弟。我们都受过帝国主义的难，现在我们解放，你们独立，建设需要和平，像耕种需要土地。和平需要保卫，团结就是友谊。让拼凑侵略性集团的在这里碰壁！让制造分裂的成为我们的死敌！中缅两国是“胞波”，树立亚洲国家和平共处的新范例。
