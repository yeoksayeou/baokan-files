Xinhua News Agency, September 29th: The Swedish men's table tennis team lost to the fiercely attacking Chinese youth men's table tennis team by a score of two to five in their fifth friendly match in China tonight in Beijing.

	Tonight's match was basically an attack versus defense affair. Exciting scenes frequently occurred with Chinese players using penhold grips moving close to the table for powerful smashes, while the guest team players using shakehand grips moved away from the table to save the ball. Nineteen-year-old Zhuang Zedong of the home team played the best, defeating three players from the guest team – Larson, Börg, and Ljungström – in succession with a score of two to zero.

	The guest team's two points were won by Larson and Börg, who are good at both defense and attack. They defeated eighteen-year-old Hu Daoben and twenty-one-year-old Zhou Lansun with a score of two to zero, respectively.

	The Swedish men's table tennis team returned to Beijing after visiting Guangzhou and Shanghai. Their record in the previous four friendly matches was one win and three losses. On October 2nd, they will also hold a friendly match with the Chinese men's table tennis team in Beijing.
