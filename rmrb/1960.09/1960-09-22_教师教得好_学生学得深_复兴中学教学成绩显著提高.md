Teachers Teach Well, Students Learn Deeply
　　Significant Improvement in Academic Performance at Fuxing Middle School

    (Our report) Shanghai's Fuxing Middle School, in its teaching reform experiments, has seen teachers continuously eliminate bourgeois educational thinking and pay attention to fostering students' initiative and enthusiasm in learning, allowing the teaching reform work to proceed very smoothly. Last semester, without increasing teaching hours, the teaching level of many subjects in this school was raised compared to the original, and some modern knowledge of production and science and technology was added. The semester's exam results showed a significant improvement over previous semesters.
    In the first half of this year, under the leadership of the Party, Fuxing Middle School, based on the rapidly developing situation of socialist construction, began to carry out teaching reform. According to the principle of linking theory with practice, they appropriately streamlined, deepened, and updated the teaching materials of various subjects to varying degrees, requiring students to learn more and learn better. In the teaching reform, students were first educated on the excellent situation, and they were often organized to study Chairman Mao's works and visit factories to participate in technological innovation and technological revolution movements, so that the students closely linked the general line with their own learning, thus setting off a mass movement of "learn more, learn better". At the same time, it was required that this political and ideological education be implemented in every subject. Teachers of mathematics, physics, and chemistry natural sciences, which were always considered difficult to combine with political and ideological education, also began to lecture in connection with the technological revolution, technological innovation movement, and agricultural mechanization. Originally, "approximate calculation" in mathematics was never taught well, and students also found it boring and tedious. After the teachers repeatedly explained the relationship between "approximate calculation" and the calculation of accuracy, which is of great significance in national construction, it aroused the students' attention. Therefore, students not only listened attentively and studied their homework diligently, but also took the initiative to ask teachers to guide them in tackling difficulties, and the quality of learning was greatly improved. When preparing lessons, many teachers have begun to go deep into the students to understand their actual needs, and strengthen the students' purpose of learning through lesson preparation. In lecturing, they also focus on the key issues and explain them thoroughly, focusing on the teaching objectives and tasks, while general problems are based on the students' original foundation, inspiring students to infer other cases from one instance, and allowing students to understand and master them through practice. For the correction of homework and test papers in higher grades, teachers also selectively correct some of them according to the purpose and requirements of the homework, identify common problems and different types of advantages and disadvantages, and guide students to correct some of them themselves. These methods not only deepened students' understanding and application of knowledge, but also guided students to consciously grasp the enthusiasm for scientific and cultural knowledge, greatly stimulated students' desire for knowledge, and thus enabled the reformed courses to proceed smoothly according to schedule.

　　教师教得好　学生学得深
　　复兴中学教学成绩显著提高
    本报讯　上海复兴中学在教学改革试验中，教师们不断破除资产阶级教育思想，注意发挥学生学习中的主动性、积极性，使教学改革工作进行得很顺利。上学期，这所学校在没有增加教学时间的条件下，许多学科的教学程度，都比原来提高了，并且增加了一些生产上、科学技术上的现代知识。学期的考试成绩比以往各个学期都有显著的提高。
    今年上半年，复兴中学在党的领导下，根据社会主义建设事业迅速发展的形势，开始进行教学改革。他们根据理论联系实际的原则，对各门学科的教材在不同程度上进行适当精简、加深和更新，要求学生能够学得更多、学得更好。在教学改革中，首先对学生进行了大好形势的教育，并且经常组织学生学习毛主席著作和到工厂参观、参加技术革新、技术革命运动，使学生们把总路线与自己的学习密切地联系起来，从而掀起了“学多一些、学好一些”的群众运动。同时要求把这些政治思想教育贯彻到每一门学科中去。一向认为难于结合进行政治思想教育的数学、物理和化学自然学科，教师们也开始同技术革命、技术革新运动和农业机械化等联系起来讲课。原来数学中“近似计算”一直教不好，学生也感到枯燥乏味。教师把“近似计算”对于国家建设中具有重要意义的精确度计算的关系，反复向学生说明以后，引起学生的重视。因此学生不仅认真听讲，钻研作业，并且主动要求教师指导攻难点，学习质量有了很大提高。备课时，许多教师已开始深入到学生中去，了解学生的实际要求，通过备课加强学生学习的目的性。在讲课时，也围绕教学目的和任务，注意抓住关键问题讲深讲透，一般问题则根据学生的原有基础，启发学生举一反三，通过练习，由学生自己理解掌握。对高年级作业、试卷的批改，教师也根据作业的目的要求，有重点地批改一部分，找出共同性问题和不同类型的优缺点，指导学生自行批改一部分。这些方法不仅加深了学生对知识的理解和运用，并且引导了学生自觉地掌握科学文化知识的积极性，大大激发了学生的求知欲，因而使改革的各科课程都顺利地按进度进行。
