Fujian
    
According to Xinhua News Agency, Fujian is making great efforts to manage the fields in remote areas, low-yield fields, and late-transplanted fields in various places, striving for a greater autumn grain harvest.
    
Most of the middle and late rice in Fujian are growing well. However, according to inspections, some of the rice seedlings in remote fields, low-yield fields, and late-transplanted fields are growing poorly and need further processing and fertilization to catch up. In order to seize a balanced increase in autumn production, all localities have adopted the method of assigning leaders, labor, and measures while vigorously grasping the field management of high-yield fields, and have firmly grasped the field management of remote fields, low-yield fields, and late-transplanted fields. After examining the fields team by team, Zhangpu County, while fixing leaders and labor to strengthen the management of more than 100,000 mu of high-yield fields, transferred more than 2,000 cadres and more than 12,000 commune members to establish 881 professional teams to be specifically responsible for the management of more than 48,000 mu of remote fields, low-yield fields, and late-transplanted fields, striving to make the yield of these fields catch up with that of ordinary high-yield fields.

Jiangxi
    
Xinhua News Agency: The rural people's communes in Jiangxi have launched a vigorous and high-standard, high-quality field management competition.
    
This year, under the guidance of the principle of taking grain as the key link, comprehensively developing, combining multiple planting with multiple harvesting and high yield with multiple harvesting, Jiangxi Province has tried its best to expand the planting of single-season late rice, double-season late rice, and autumn-harvesting miscellaneous grain crops such as sweet potatoes. August and September are the key periods for the growth of these crops. In order to strive for a greater autumn grain harvest, people's communes in various places have quickly shifted their main leadership and labor to autumn field management, and extensively mobilized the masses to summarize the summer field management experience, and formulated autumn field management competition standards with high standards and high-quality requirements. The autumn field management competition standards of the communes and production teams in Yichun Prefecture are: all autumn fields must achieve: 1. Full seedlings, uniform seedlings, and strong seedlings, 2. Three cultivations and weeding, 3. Three topdressings, 4. No insects, no pests, and no weeds. Each county in Ji'an Prefecture requires autumn fields to meet the standards of summer field management. Through the extensive establishment of pacesetters, all communes and production teams have fully invested in the "Autumn Field Management Surpassing Summer Field" competition.
    
Effectively grasping the field management of remote fields, low-yield fields, and newly planted late-rice fields is an important link in achieving comprehensive high standards and high quality in autumn field management. To this end, all localities have organized special forces to take effective measures to manage the above three types of fields in the competition.

Shaanxi
    
According to Xinhua News Agency, according to the current excellent situation of vigorously running agriculture and vigorously running grain, the people's communes in Shaanxi Province are concentrating their superior forces to add water and fertilizer to the insurance fields, continuously improving the management standards of the insurance fields, and striving for increased production of more grain from the insurance fields, and using the insurance fields as a model to drive the management of ordinary fields.
    
Since the Shaanxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China issued a call to the people of the province at the end of June to establish three lines of defense and two sets of gongs and drums to overcome natural disasters and ensure increased production in autumn fields, more than 14 million mu of insurance fields have been established throughout the province, averaging nearly one mu per person according to the province's population.
    
Recently, there has been widespread heavy rain in various parts of Shaanxi. In recent days, the labor force invested in autumn field management throughout the province has increased sharply from 2.5 million during the drought resistance period in June and July to 4.9 million. The vast number of cadres have gone deep into the front line of production to lead commune members to strengthen autumn field management. In particular, the management of insurance fields has been strengthened. Due to meticulous management and sufficient water and fertilizer, the crops in the province's insurance fields are generally growing well. According to the inspection results of Hancheng, Bin County, Weinan, Xi'an, and other counties and cities, the corn in the insurance fields generally has one more cob than ordinary fields.

Shandong
    
According to Xinhua News Agency, cotton-producing areas in Shandong are strengthening the late-stage management of cotton fields and striving for a greater cotton harvest.
    
At present, the cotton in Shandong is in the period of forming autumn bolls and preserving the early bolls. According to the growth law of cotton bolls, "half early, half autumn," and the characteristics of the Dai-character cotton's strong boll-forming ability and great potential for increasing production in the later stage, leading cadres at all levels have gone deep into the fields, mobilized the masses to take measures such as topdressing, loosening the soil, pruning, and preventing pests and diseases. Gaomi County quickly concentrated more than 85,000 laborers and formed specialized teams for cultivating and earthing up, preventing and controlling pests, etc., and carried out comprehensive management with high-yield fields as the position. Due to careful management, the boll and bud abscission rate has been greatly reduced.
    
Some time ago, due to continuous overcast and rainy weather in some areas of Shandong, some cotton fields experienced weed growth. Leaders at all levels in these areas quickly mobilized forces and took various measures to strengthen cotton field management according to soil conditions and different degrees of weed growth.

Inner Mongolia
    
According to Xinhua News Agency, all parts of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region are making every effort to strengthen the late-stage management of autumn crops, striving to increase grain production in the autumn of this year. At present, more than 2 million laborers in rural areas in various parts of the autonomous region are participating in field management, and 160,000 cadres of all ethnic groups are participating in production and leading production on the front line of production.
    
In the three eastern leagues of the autonomous region, Hulunbuir, Jirem, and Zhaowuda, there has been sufficient rainfall this year, and various crops are nearing maturity. In order to achieve high yields and multiple harvests, all localities have immediately organized forces to universally carry out measures such as pulling out large weeds, pulling out diseased plants, and releasing autumn ridges (loosening the soil and weeding) after the end of hoeing, so as to promote better crop growth. For some late-field crops that are still growing, all localities have concentrated their efforts on hoeing, topdressing, and adding water to vigorously attack the heading and seed-setting stages, preventing the crops from being greedy for green and promoting rapid crop growth and early maturity. In the Hetao Plain in western Inner Mongolia, where rice is planted the most, many communes have summarized their experience in increasing production through general inspections and formulated operating procedures for late-stage cultivation and management of paddy fields, so as to ensure that measures are taken in the fields and responsibilities are assigned to individuals.

Gansu
    
According to Xinhua News Agency, the people of Gansu Province are actively responding to the Provincial Party Committee's call to seize the current favorable opportunity for autumn field management, increase measures, and strive to obtain more harvests in the autumn, and have launched a large-scale autumn field management shock campaign.
    
The shock campaign is centered on weeding, and all localities have mobilized large numbers of government cadres, enterprise employees, school teachers and students, military officers and soldiers, and urban residents to participate in weeding.
    
Due to the decisive measures taken by various localities to vigorously grasp labor arrangement and use, the number of people participating in the shock weeding throughout the province has now reached more than 1.4 million.
    
Leading cadres at all levels have also gone deep into the fields, weeding together with the masses, and helping grass-roots cadres solve specific problems, so as to promote the vigorous and solid development of the movement.
    
While vigorously grasping weeding, all localities have firmly grasped topdressing, watering, and prevention and control of plant diseases and insect pests, and have tried every means to improve the level of autumn field management in a meticulous and refined manner.
    
At present, all localities are continuing to mobilize labor and strengthen autumn field management in order to effectively manage autumn fields well and meticulously, and strive for increased production in autumn fields.

    据新华社讯 福建各地大抓边远田、低产田和迟插田的田间管理，力争多收秋粮。
    福建各地大部分中、晚稻生长良好。但据检查，有些边远田、低产田和迟插田的禾苗长得较差，需要进一步加工加肥才能迎头赶上。为了夺取秋季平衡增产，各地在大抓丰产田田间管理的同时，都采取定领导、定劳力、定措施的办法，狠抓边远田、低产田和迟插田的田间管理。漳浦县各公社经过逐丘站队，在固定领导、劳力对十万多亩丰产田加强管理的同时，抽调了两千多名干部和一万二千多个社员，建立了八百八十一个专业队，专门负责管理四万八千多亩边远田、低产田和迟插田，力争这些田地产量能赶上一般的丰产田。
    江西
    新华社讯　江西各地农村人民公社掀起了轰轰烈烈的高标准、高质量田间管理竞赛运动。
    今年江西省在以粮为纲全面发展以及多种多收和高产多收相结合的方针指导下，尽力扩种了一季晚稻、二季晚稻和红薯等秋收杂粮作物。8、9两月，是这些作物生长的关键时期，为了力争多收秋粮，各地人民公社都把主要领导力量、主要劳力迅速转向秋田管理，并广泛发动群众总结夏季田间管理经验，以高标准、高质量的要求，制定了秋田管理竞赛标准。宜春专区各公社生产队的秋田管理竞赛标准是：全部秋田要达到：一、苗全、苗匀、苗壮，二、三耘除草，三、三追肥，四、无虫、无害、无杂草。吉安专区各县以夏田管理标准要求秋田，通过广泛树立标兵，所有公社和生产队全部投入了“秋田管理超夏田”的大竞赛。
    切实抓好远田、低产田、新晚稻田的田间管理，是实现秋田管理全面高标准、高质量的重要一环。为此，各地在竞赛中都组织专门力量采取有效措施管好上述三种田地。
    陕西
    据新华社讯　陕西省各地人民公社，根据当前大办农业、大办粮食的大好形势，集中优势力量给保险田加水、加肥，不断提高保险田管理标准，力争保险田增产更多的粮食，并以保险田为榜样带动一般田的管理工作。
    6月底，中共陕西省委向全省人民发出建立三道防线、两套锣鼓战胜自然灾害确保秋田增产的号召以来，全省已经建立了一千四百多万亩保险田，按全省人口平均，每人接近一亩。
    最近，陕西各地普降透雨。连日来全省投入秋田管理的劳力已由6、7月份抗旱时期的二百五十万人猛增到四百九十万人。广大干部都深入生产第一线，领导社员加强秋田管理。特别是加强对保险田的管理。由于管理细致，水足肥多，全省保险田庄稼普遍生长良好，根据韩城、邠县、渭南、西安等县市检查结果，保险田中的玉米普遍比一般田多一个棒子。
    山东
    据新华社讯　山东各产棉区加强棉田后期管理，力争棉花多收。
    目前，山东各地棉花正是座秋桃，保伏桃的时期。根据棉花座桃“伏一半、秋一半”的生长规律，和岱字棉后期结铃性强，增产潜力大的特点，各级领导干部深入田间，发动群众采取追肥、松土、整枝和防止虫害等措施。高密县迅速集中了八万五千多名劳力，分别组成中耕培土，防治虫害等专业队伍，以丰产田为阵地，全面进行管理。由于管理精细，铃蕾脱落率大大减少。
    前些日子，山东部分地区因阴雨连绵，一部分棉田出现草荒，这些地区各级领导都迅速调集力量，根据土质条件和草荒不同程度，分别采取各种办法加强棉田管理。
    内蒙古
    据新华社讯　内蒙古自治区各地全力加强秋田作物的后期管理，力争今年秋季多增产一些粮食。目前，自治区各地农村参加田间管理的劳力达二百多万名，有十六万名各族干部在生产第一线参加生产领导生产。
    自治区东部呼伦贝尔、哲里木、昭乌达三个盟，今年雨水充足，各种作物已接近成熟，为了达到高产多收，各地在铲趟结束以后，立即组织力量普遍进行拔大草，拔病株，放秋垄（松土锄草）等措施，促使作物长得更好。对于一些正在生长的晚田作物，各地集中力量进行铲趟、追肥、加水猛攻抽穗、结籽关，防止作物贪青，促使作物快长早熟。水稻播种最多的内蒙古西部河套平原，有不少公社通过大检查，总结增产经验，制定了稻田后期培育管理操作规程，做到措施到田，责任到人。
    甘肃
    据新华社讯　甘肃省人民积极响应省委关于抓紧当前秋田管理大好时机，增加措施，力争秋季得到更多收成的号召，开展了大规模的秋田田间管理突击运动。
    突击运动以锄草为中心，各地都动员了大批机关干部、企业职工、学校师生、部队官兵和城市居民，参加锄草。
    由于各地采取断然措施，大抓劳力安排和使用，目前全省参加突击锄草的人数已达一百四十多万人。
    各级领导干部也都深入到田间，一面和群众一起锄草，一面帮基层干部解决具体问题，促进运动轰轰烈烈、扎扎实实的发展。
    各地在大抓锄草的同时，狠抓了追肥、浇水和防治病虫害等工作，并千方百计、精益求精地提高秋田管理水平。
    目前，各地正在继续调动劳力，加强秋田田间管理，以切实把秋田管好、管细，争取秋田增产。
