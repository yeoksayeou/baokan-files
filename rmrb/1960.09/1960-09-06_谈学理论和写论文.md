    On Studying Theory and Writing Papers
    Sha Ying
    Recently, many articles by responsible comrades from provincial and municipal Party committees have been published in newspapers and periodicals across the country. These articles are generally practical and theoretical, combining the concrete and the abstract, and are rich in content, providing valuable guidance for the current struggles, and are therefore very popular with readers. At the same time, newspapers and periodicals in various places have also published a large number of papers by workers and peasants. These papers are characterized by: clear viewpoints, passionate language, rich theoretical color and fighting spirit; in terms of writing style, they are short, concise, popular and lively, without student jargon or bureaucratic clichés, and are therefore also deeply welcomed by the broad masses of readers. These are two great good things, and we should fully appreciate their significance. It marks that our theoretical study has entered a new, more in-depth, more extensive, and more high-spirited stage.
    The fact that responsible comrades of provincial and municipal Party committees are writing a lot of articles, especially the fact that workers and peasants are writing a lot of papers, illustrates many problems and provides us with many inspirations.
      "Too busy, no time to study!" Many comrades are currently studying actively, but there are still some comrades who often complain like this. It is true that work is busy and time is short. We live in the era of the Great Leap Forward, and all kinds of work are racing against time, who is not busy? However, we cannot stop or relax our study because we are busy. Marxism-Leninism is the basis of all our policies and the guide of all our practical activities. Improving theoretical level and correctly grasping policies are the fundamental guarantees for us to do our work well. Especially in the current situation, in order to deeply understand the spirit of the Party's policies, in order to have a correct analysis and prediction of the new problems that occur in the Great Leap Forward, in order to scientifically summarize the rich experience we have created, and in order to effectively improve our leadership methods and work style, it is urgently required that we strengthen our theoretical study. As for where to find the time for study? Comrade Mao Zedong told us long ago: one is to squeeze, and the other is to be good at arranging. In order to improve production, we must "fight for every second," and in order to produce more grain, we must "seize every opportunity." We must have this spirit of striving for self-improvement in dealing with the issue of study. Study time is squeezed out. A trickle of water can converge into a river. If we can "fight for every second" and "seize every opportunity," we will always be able to squeeze out some time; if we can also arrange our work and life better, combine work and rest, and pay attention to improving work methods, then we will squeeze out even more time. In ancient China, there were beautiful stories such as collecting fireflies for light, reflecting the snow for light, chiseling a hole in the wall to steal light, and suspending hair from the ceiling to prevent drowsiness. This spirit of diligent study is worth learning from. Now, aren't many tasks requiring "the secretary to take the lead"? Many provincial and municipal Party secretaries are really busy! But they still study seriously and write many articles. Hebei Province and many other places have implemented the "two-five system," so that cadres in counties, communes, and management areas can get one day of study time in seven days. The production of workers and peasants is very intense, but many people also seize the time to study seriously and write many articles. The workers in Shanghai said: "Production is busy, innovation is busy, writing articles in the midst of all the busyness, the thought of Mao Zedong shines brightly." In the face of these examples, I think: comrades who say they have no time to study should think more and wake up.
      "I have learned some theory, but I don't know how to use it, what should I do?" Our purpose of learning theory is for application, it is to "shoot the arrow at the target." Our method of learning theory is to integrate theory with practice, it is to "seek truth from facts." How to apply theory, how to integrate with practice? Many comrades still hold a mysterious view on this issue, and have a feeling of "sighing at the ocean!" In fact, as long as you use your brain, think more, and experiment more, the problem is not that difficult. For example: we have learned the theory of building the country with diligence and thrift, running communes with diligence and thrift, and running all undertakings with diligence and thrift, then we can think about it in connection with our own department, our own work, and our own life: are there any phenomena that do not conform to the principle of diligence and thrift, how is the work of increasing production and practicing economy going, and how to improve it in the future, etc. For another example: we want to establish a solid proletarian world outlook, highly promote the communist style, and strive to overcome the bourgeois selfish individualism; in this way, we can always pay attention to checking our own thoughts: is there a problem with the world outlook, how is the communist consciousness, what are the remaining individualistic thoughts, and how to intensify ideological transformation, etc. Things like this. Some people say: "This is not a theoretical problem, this is not integrating with practice!" This view is wrong, are the issues about the policy of building the country, about establishing the proletarian world outlook, not theoretical issues? Is it not integrating with practice that the work has been promoted and the ideology has been transformed due to the learning of these theories? The articles of many responsible comrades of provincial and municipal Party committees are mostly based on the actual situation of their own provinces, and after investigation and research, they are elevated to theoretical principles, expounding the Party's policies, and summarizing work experience; there is analysis, there is synthesis, there are materials, and there are viewpoints. This provides us with many good examples of integrating theory with practice. Many papers by workers and peasants are mostly closely related to production and life, explaining certain issues through concrete examples, discussing the abstract based on the concrete, combining learning and application. After learning "On Contradiction," they explored what contradictions exist in their factories and communes, and what contradiction is the main contradiction? After learning "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People," they further analyzed the nature of various contradictions and looked for ways to resolve the contradictions. This provides us with many good examples of integrating theory with practice. Of course, in the face of complex situations, when dealing with some major issues, especially at the critical juncture of the revolution, the situation is changing rapidly, and new things are emerging one after another, it is not easy for us to stand firm, judge the situation, distinguish right from wrong, and decide on countermeasures. We must never see integrating theory with practice as very simple, easy, and hasty. If so, we will make big mistakes. Lenin said that the soul of Marxism lies in the concrete analysis of the concrete situation. This ability to analyze concretely is not achieved overnight. However, this is not something "out of reach." Comrade Mao Zedong's works are a model of combining the universal truth of Marxism-Leninism with the concrete practice of the Chinese revolution. The Party's policies are also the products of close integration of theory with practice. As long as we seriously study Comrade Mao Zedong's works, seriously study the Party's documents, and strive to understand their spirit and essence; at the same time, go deep among the masses, "dissect sparrows" more, study the practical problems in the revolution and construction more, and constantly summarize work experience, we will gradually improve the ability of theoretical analysis. Learning theory and applying theory cannot only rely on reading books, but also rely on tempering in actual struggles. Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out as early as in the article "Reform Our Study": "The policy for educating cadres at work and in cadre schools should be to center on the study of the practical problems of the Chinese revolution and to take the basic principles of Marxism-Leninism as the guide, and to abolish the method of studying Marxism-Leninism statically and in isolation," "That is, to study the theory of Marxism-Leninism purposefully, to combine the theory of Marxism-Leninism with the actual movement of the Chinese revolution, to find its position, its viewpoints, and its methods in order to solve the theoretical and strategic problems of the Chinese revolution." By studying according to this correct policy and method, we will progress faster. Marx said in the preface and postscript to the French translation of "Capital": "There is no smooth road in science, only those who are not afraid of hardship in climbing on the rugged path have the hope to reach the glorious peak." We should have a strong thirst for knowledge and a high degree of initiative, and advance towards that "glorious peak" with confidence!
      "Theory is something that everyone must learn, as for writing articles, that is the business of writers, theorists and ‘scholars’!" Of course, writers, theorists and "scholars" are to write articles, this is their business; but can we say that ordinary cadres do not need to write articles? First, every one of our cadres is not only a worker, but also a propagandist. We must not only do work every day, but also pay attention to publicizing the Party's policies and expanding the Party's political influence. Our Party Constitution stipulates that "explaining the Party's policies and resolutions to the masses of the people" is the obligation of every Party member. Strictly speaking, propaganda is one of the work contents of every revolutionary cadre. In order to publicize well, we must naturally strive to learn theory. And writing articles is a very important propaganda tool, and is one of the essential weapons for every revolutionary cadre, and cannot be lacking. Second, no matter what kind of work, we must often make plans, issue instructions, write reports, and make summaries, but these things are closely related to studying theory and writing articles. If we strive to study theory and write articles, we can do these things better, which is very beneficial to the work. Why do some people when writing reports and making summaries, not list phenomena, verbose and lengthy, lacking concrete analysis, and without clear viewpoints; but lacking necessary materials, without typical examples, only a few abstract principles, dry and boring? Such things, no matter how long or short, are boring to read, and not much is gained. This phenomenon is closely related to the theoretical level and thought methods of some cadres, and is also related to the writing ability of some cadres. Therefore, improving the theoretical level, learning to write articles, paying attention to logic, paying attention to wording, and writing our documents accurately, vividly, and vividly, so that people love to read them and make people think deeply, this is really of great benefit to our work. Picking up the pen is not just the business of language teachers, nor is it just the business of "scholars," but comrades in various work positions should pay attention to learning. Third, studying theory and writing articles are closely related. Without learning theory, without reading books seriously, and lacking the ability to analyze concretely, one cannot write good articles; but without using the pen and writing articles, one often cannot learn theory well. The formation of a concept or a viewpoint requires reading books and conducting investigation and research, this is the process of thinking. And writing articles is to express this concept or this viewpoint and infect others. However, in order to express it correctly and infect it powerfully, in the process of writing, one must repeatedly think about one's own thoughts and viewpoints, and chew on them many times. This process of repeated thinking and chewing is a more complex process of thinking, a higher digestion process of learning theory, a process of further understanding the spirit of theory and practical application, and also a process of training thought methods and improving the level of thinking. Comrade Mao Zedong has repeatedly instructed us that cadres should learn to write articles, and more responsible cadres should also write more, and important documents should be done by themselves or in cooperation. This is not only to promote work, but also to improve cadres. Now many Party schools and political schools stipulate that students write articles regularly, and closely combine learning theory with writing articles. This method of "walking on two legs" can not only improve the level of theoretical thinking, but also cultivate writing ability, which is undoubtedly very correct. The county and commune cadres in Tang County, Hebei Province, advocated the combination of "learning, doing, researching, and writing" in their studies, with the secretary taking the lead and everyone starting to write articles summarizing experience, and achieved good results. Now, the workers and peasants in various places are also closely combining learning theory with writing articles. For example, the broad masses of workers and peasants in Heilongjiang Province have achieved remarkable results through the "reading, discussing, speaking, writing, and using" five-character learning method created through learning practice. In 1959, they wrote more than 160,000 papers, of which more than 400 were published in central, provincial, and local newspapers and periodicals.
      "I also want to write articles, but I don't know how to write, I can't write well, what should I do?" This is a psychological state of many comrades. Some comrades are really vigorous in their work, daring to think, daring to speak, and daring to do; but when it comes to writing articles, they underestimate themselves and think it is unattainable. Here, I will not talk about the writing method (although it is also important), but only talk about the ideological issue. If the ideological issue is resolved, everything will be easy to handle. As the saying goes, "Nothing is difficult in the world for those who set their minds on it." As long as we study theory seriously and intend to write articles, it will not be difficult. In fact, writing articles is not an unreachable thing, and living examples are in front of us: many workers and peasants are writing articles, and many articles are written very well. As a cadre, of course, it can be done. Therefore, the problem is only that we must thoroughly liberate our minds, break superstitions, summon up our energy, study diligently, and practice hard. To learn to swim, you have to go into the water; to do science, you have to experiment; to write articles, you have to read more books and pick up the pen to practice. As long as you have determination and ambition, and boldly pick up the pen to write, once, twice, three times... you will definitely be able to write good articles slowly. Of course, in the process of learning to write articles, you will also encounter many difficulties and failures, which requires perseverance, determination, and the spirit of overcoming difficulties. The knife becomes sharper the more it is sharpened, and the pen becomes more flexible the more it is used. As long as you study and practice more, you will naturally write good articles. Otherwise, if you don't use the pen for a long time, even a writer's pen will "rust." If you use the pen more and think hard, and write better articles, you will gradually develop a strong interest in writing articles. A person often has a feeling like a mother treats her own child for his own works. In talking about his own writing experience, Ni·Ostrovsky said: "This requires firm tenacity and hard work. You know, overcoming difficulties on this road is a very good stimulant in itself." Ni·Ostrovsky's writing conditions were very bad, and he became a great writer after very hard work. No matter what we do, we must despise difficulties strategically and attach importance to difficulties tactically. On the one hand, we must establish lofty ambitions and have clear directions and long-term goals; on the other hand, we must work diligently and conscientiously. Combine soaring energy with scientific analysis, and combine daring to think and daring to do with seeking truth from facts. This is our essential communist style and scientific work style. I think this must also be the case in the issue of studying theory and writing articles.
    Anything requires the leadership of the Party. Studying theory and writing articles mainly rely on individual consciousness and initiative, but the leadership of the Party organization is also indispensable. Only when the Party organization strengthens the leadership of cadres' study, helps them formulate study plans, advocates a trend of reading books seriously and writing articles, regularly checks and supervises, helps them solve the difficulties in study and writing, such as tutoring problems, time arrangement problems, etc., and combines cadres' conscious study with the active leadership of the Party organization, can the theoretical level and writing ability of cadres be rapidly improved.
    Comrade Mao Zedong said: "Apart from other characteristics, the most striking thing about China's 600 million people is that they are 'poor and blank.' This may seem a bad thing, but in reality it is a good thing. Being poor makes people want to change, to work, to make revolution. A clean sheet of paper has no burdens, so it is easy to write the newest and most beautiful words and paint the newest and most beautiful pictures." With the great victory of our country in economic construction, the upsurge of technological revolution and cultural revolution has arrived. In order to change the backwardness of "poverty and blankness," the Chinese people and the broad masses of cadres must, on the one hand, immerse themselves in hard work, adhere to the policy of building the country with diligence and thrift, rigorously increase production and practice economy, and actively build so as to build our country into a prosperous and strong socialist country; on the other hand, they must strive to study Marxism-Leninism, strive to study Mao Zedong's works, adhere to the policy of letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend, develop our country's science and culture, improve the people's communist consciousness, so that we will appear in the world as a nation with a high degree of culture. In the current situation, striving to learn theory and striving to write articles are major things that we must pay attention to. While doing a good job in production and doing a good job in work, let us seize the time, combine work and rest, read more books, pick up the pen more, study diligently and practice hard, constantly improve the level of cultural theory, write the newest and most beautiful words, and paint the newest and most beautiful pictures. We must train ourselves to become a cadre who is "both red and expert" and "proficient in one major and capable in many things," and we must strive to turn our great motherland into a country that is rich, strong, new, and beautiful as soon as possible!

    谈学理论和写论文沙英
    最近一个时期，在全国各地报刊上，登载了许多省、市委负责同志的文章；这些文章，大都是既有实际，又有理论，虚实结合，内容充实，对当前的斗争富有指导意义，所以很受读者欢迎。同时，各地报刊上也登载了大量的工农群众的论文，这种论文的特点是：观点鲜明，热情洋溢，富有理论色彩和战斗精神；在文风上是短小精悍，通俗活泼，没有学生腔和八股调，所以也深受广大读者的欢迎。这是两件大好事，我们应当充分估计到它的意义。它标志着我们的理论学习已经进入了一个新的、更加深入、更加广泛和更加高涨的阶段。
    省、市委负责同志大写文章，特别是工农群众大写论文这件事，说明了许多问题，使我们的思想得到许多的启发。
      “太忙了，没有时间学！”目前很多同志都在积极地学习着，可是，总还有一些同志，却经常这样叫苦。工作忙，时间少，这确是事实。我们生活在大跃进的时代里，各种工作都在同时间竞跑，大家谁不忙呢？但是，我们不能因为忙就不学习或放松学习。马克思列宁主义是我们一切方针政策的依据，是我们一切实践活动的指南。提高理论水平，正确掌握方针政策，是我们做好工作的根本保证。特别是在当前的形势下，为了深刻地领会党的方针政策的精神，为了对于在大跃进中所发生的新问题有正确的分析和预见，为了对于我们所创造的丰富经验能进行科学的总结，为了切实改进我们的领导方法和工作作风，都迫切地要求我们加强理论学习。至于学习时间从何而来？毛泽东同志早就告诉我们：一个是挤，一个是善于安排。为了提高生产，要“分秒必争”，为了多打粮食，要“找缝插针”，在对待学习这个问题上，也要有这种发愤图强的精神。学习时间是挤出来的。涓滴之水，可以汇成江河。如果我们能“分秒必争”，“找缝插针”，总会挤出一些时间来的；如果我们又能把工作和生活安排得好一些，做到劳逸结合，注意改进工作方法，那就更会多挤出一些时间来的。我国古人曾有囊萤、映雪、凿壁偷光、悬梁刺股等优美的故事，这种刻苦攻读的精神，是值得我们学习的。现在许多工作不都是要“书记挂帅”吗，许多省、市委书记真是忙得很啊！可是他们还是认真地学，而且还写出不少文章来了。河北省和其他许多地方推行“二五制”，使县、公社和管理区的干部在七天中都能得到一天的学习时间。工农群众的生产是很紧张的，可是不少人也是抓紧时间认真地学，而且也写出许多文章来了。上海的工人们说：“生产忙，革新忙，百忙之中写文章，毛泽东思想放光芒。”在这些事例面前，我想：说没有时间学习的同志，应当多思多想，有所醒悟。
      “理论是学了些，可是不会用，怎么办？”我们学习理论的目的是为了应用，是“有的放矢”。我们学习理论的方法是理论联系实际，是“实事求是”。怎样应用理论，怎样联系实际呢？有不少同志对这个问题还抱着一种神秘的观点，有“望洋兴叹”之感！其实，只要开动脑筋，多想，多试验，问题并不是那么困难的。例如说：我们学习了关于勤俭建国、勤俭办社、勤俭办一切事业的理论，这就可以联系自己的部门、自己的工作和自己的生活想一想：是否有不符合勤俭原则的现象，增产节约搞得怎样，今后如何改进，等等。再例如说：我们要树立巩固的无产阶级的世界观，高度发扬共产主义风格，努力克服资产阶级的自私自利的个人主义；这样我们就可以经常注意检查自己的思想：世界观有没有问题，共产主义的觉悟如何，还有哪些个人主义思想，怎样加紧改造思想，等等。诸如此类。有人说：“这不是理论问题，这不是联系实际！”这种看法不对，难道关于建国的方针问题，关于树立无产阶级的世界观问题，不是理论问题吗？难道由于学习了这些理论而推动了工作和改造了思想，这不是联系实际吗。许多省、市委负责同志的文章，大都是从本省的实际情况出发，经过调查研究，提高到理论原则上，阐明党的方针政策，总结工作经验；有分析、有综合，有材料、有观点。这给我们提供了许多理论联系实际的好例子。许多工农群众的论文，大都是密切联系生产和生活，通过具体的事例说明某些问题，就实论虚，学用结合，他们学习了《矛盾论》，就探讨他们的工厂、公社里有哪些矛盾，什么矛盾是主要矛盾？他们学习了《关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题》，就进一步分析各种矛盾的性质，寻找解决矛盾的方法。这又给我们提供了许多理论联系实际的好例子。当然，在错综复杂的情况下面，处理一些重大问题的时候，特别是在革命的紧要关头，情况千变万化，新事物层出不穷，我们要能站稳立场，判明局势，分清是非，决定对策，那也是很不容易的事情。我们也决不要把理论联系实际看得很简单，轻而易举，草率从事。如果那样，那是要犯大错误的。列宁说过，马克思主义的灵魂，就在于具体地分析具体的情况。这种具体分析的能力，不是一朝一夕之功。但是，这也并不是什么“望尘莫及”的事情。毛泽东同志的著作，是把马克思列宁主义的普遍真理同中国革命的具体实践相结合的典范。我们党的方针政策，也都是理论密切联系实际的产物。只要我们认真地学习毛泽东同志的著作，认真地研究党的文件，努力领会它们的精神和实质；同时，深入群众，多“解剖麻雀”，多研究革命和建设中的实际问题，经常总结工作经验，我们就会逐渐提高理论分析的能力。学理论，应用理论，这决不能光靠看书，还要靠在实际斗争中的锻炼。毛泽东同志早在“改造我们的学习”一文中指出：“对于在职干部的教育和干部学校的教育，应确立以研究中国革命实际问题为中心，以马克思列宁主义基本原则为指导的方针，废除静止地孤立地研究马克思列宁主义的方法”“就是要有目的地去研究马克思列宁主义的理论，要使马克思列宁主义的理论和中国革命的实际运动结合起来，是为着解决中国革命的理论问题和策略问题而去从它找立场，找观点，找方法的。”按照这种正确的方针和方法学习，我们就会进步得快一些。马克思在《资本论》的法文译本之序与跋中说：“在科学上面是没有平安的大路可走的，只有那在崎岖小路的攀登上不畏劳苦的人，有希望到达光辉的顶点。”我们应当有强烈的求知欲和高度的积极性，满怀信心地朝着那“光辉的顶点”前进！
      “理论是大家都要学的，至于写文章，那是作家、理论家和‘秀才’们的事情！”当然作家、理论家和
  “秀才”们是要写文章的，这是他们的业务；但是能不能说一般干部不需要写文章呢？第一，我们每一个干部，既是一个工作员，又是一个宣传员。我们不仅要天天做工作，而且要经常注意宣传党的方针政策，扩大党的政治影响。我们的党章中规定：“向人民群众解释党的政策和决议”，是每一个党员的义务。严格地说，宣传，是每一个革命干部的工作内容之一。为了宣传得好，自然要努力学理论。而写文章，则是一种非常重要的宣传工具，是每一个革命干部所必备的武器之一，不可缺少。第二，不论那种工作，都要经常订计划、发指示、写报告、作总结，可是这些事情，同学理论和写文章是密切相关的，如果努力学理论和写文章，就可以把这些事情做得更好一些，十分有利于工作。为什么有些人在写报告、作总结的时候，不是现象罗列，繁琐冗长，缺乏具体的分析，没有鲜明的观点；就是缺少必要的材料，没有典型的事例，只有几条抽象的道理，干巴巴的，枯燥无味呢？这样的东西，不论长短，读起来都是令人厌倦的，所得不大的。这种现象同一些干部的理论水平和思想方法很有关系，同一些干部的写作能力也有关系。因此，提高理论水平，学习写文章，讲究逻辑，注意词藻，把我们的文件写得又准确、又鲜明、又生动，使人爱读，发人深思，这实在对我们的工作大有好处。拿笔杆子，这绝不只是语文教师的事情，也不只是“秀才”们的事情，而是各种工作岗位上的同志都应当注意学习的。第三，学理论和写文章有十分密切的关系。不学理论，不认真读书，缺乏具体分析的能力，就不会写出好文章；但是不动笔杆，不写文章，也常常学不好理论。一种概念、一种观点的形成，要读书，要调查研究，这是思维的过程。而写文章，是为了把这种概念、这种观点表达出来，感染别人。可是，为了正确地表达和有力地感染，在写作的过程中，要把自己的思想观点反复地思考，多次地咀嚼。这种反复思考和咀嚼的过程，是更复杂的思维过程，是学理论的一个更高的消化过程，是进一步领会理论的精神和实际运用的过程，也是一个训练思想方法和提高思想水平的过程。毛泽东同志曾多次地指示我们，干部要学习写文章，比较负责的干部也要多动笔，重要的文件要自己动手，或者合作起来做。这不仅是为了推动工作，而且也是为了提高干部。现在许多党校和政治学校，都规定学员定期写文章，把学理论和写文章密切结合起来，这种“两条腿走路”的办法，既能提高理论思想水平，又能培养写作的能力，无疑是非常正确的。河北省唐县的县、社干部，在学习中提倡“学、做、研、写”四结合，书记带头，大家动手，大写总结经验的文章，得到了很好的成绩。现在各地工农群众，也是把学理论和写文章密切结合起来进行的。例如黑龙江省的广大工农群众，通过学习实践创造的“读、论、讲、写、用”五字学习方法，就取得了显著的效果，他们在1959年写出了十六万余篇论文，其中在中央、省、地方报刊上发表的有四百多篇。
      “也想写文章，但是不会写，写不好，怎么办？”这是不少同志的一种心理状态。有的同志在工作中真是生龙活虎，敢想、敢说、敢干；可是一提起写文章，却妄自菲薄，认为那是可望而不可及的。这里不谈写作方法问题（虽然也重要），只谈思想问题。思想问题解决了，一切事情就好办了。俗语说：“天下无难事，就怕有心人”。只要我们认真学理论，有心写文章，那就不难了。其实，写文章也不是什么高不可攀的事情，活生生的例子摆在我们面前：许多工农群众都大写文章，而且有许多文章也写得很好。作为一个干部，当然也可以办得到。因此，问题只是在于我们要彻底解放思想，破除迷信，鼓足干劲，勤学苦练。要学游泳，就要下水；要搞科学，就要实验；要写文章，就要多读书，就要拿起笔来练。只要有决心，有志气，大胆地拿起笔来写，一次、两次、三次……一定可以慢慢地写出好文章来。当然，在学习写文章的过程中，也会遇到不少的困难和失败，这要有毅力，有恒心，有克服困难的精神。刀子越磨越快，笔杆越动越活，只要多学多练，自然会写出好文章来的。否则，老不动笔，就是一个写家，时间长了，笔尖也会“生锈”的。如果多动笔，并且苦思苦想，写出较好的文章来了，那就会逐渐对写文章发生浓厚的兴趣。一个人常常对自己的作品，有一种像母亲对待自己的孩子的感情。尼·奥斯特洛夫斯基在谈到自己的写作经验时说：“这需要有坚定的顽强性和艰苦的劳动。要知道，在这条路上克服困难，这件事本身就是非常好的兴奋剂。”尼·奥斯特洛夫斯基写作的条件很坏，他是经过了非常艰苦地努力而成为一个大作家的。不论搞什么事情，我们都要在战略上藐视困难，在战术上重视困难。一方面树立雄心壮志，具有明确的方向和远大的目标；一方面要勤勤恳恳，踏踏实实地干。把冲天的干劲和科学分析结合起来，把敢想敢干和实事求是结合起来。这是我们必备的共产主义风格和科学的工作作风。在学理论和写文章的问题上，我想也必须如此。
    任何事情都需要党的领导。学理论和写文章，固然主要的是依靠个人的自觉性和积极性，但是也不能缺少党组织的领导。只有党组织加强对于干部学习的领导，帮助他们制定学习规划，提倡认真读书和写文章的风气，经常检查和督促，帮助他们解决学习中和写作中的困难，如辅导问题、时间安排问题等等，把干部自觉的钻研和党组织的积极领导结合起来，才能使干部的理论水平和写作能力迅速地提高。
    毛泽东同志说：“除了别的特点之外，中国六亿人口的显著特点是一穷二白。这些看起来是坏事，其实是好事。穷则思变，要干，要革命。一张白纸，没有负担，好写最新最美的文字，好画最新最美的画图。”随着我国在经济建设上的巨大胜利，技术革命和文化革命的高潮已经到来。我国人民和广大干部为了改变
  “一穷二白”的落后面貌，一方面要埋头苦干，坚持勤俭建国的方针，厉行增产节约，积极建设，以便把我们的国家建成为一个富强的社会主义国家；一方面要努力学习马克思列宁主义，努力学习毛泽东著作，坚持百花齐放、百家争鸣的政策，发展我国的科学和文化，提高人民的共产主义觉悟，使我们将以一个具有高度文化的民族出现于世界。在当前的形势下，努力学理论，努力写文章，是我们要重视的大事情。让我们大家在搞好生产和做好工作的同时，抓紧时间，劳逸结合，多读书，多拿笔，勤学苦练，不断提高文化理论水平，写出最新最美的文字，画出最新最美的画图。我们一定要把自己培养成为一个“又红又专”和“一专多能”的干部，我们一定要争取尽快地把我们伟大的祖国变成一个又富、又强、又新、又美的国家！
