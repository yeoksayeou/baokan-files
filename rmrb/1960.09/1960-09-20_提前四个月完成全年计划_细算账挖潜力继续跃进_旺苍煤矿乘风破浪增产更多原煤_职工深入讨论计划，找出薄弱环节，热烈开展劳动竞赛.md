Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu Electric Dispatch – The Wangcang Coal Mine in Sichuan Province, on the basis of overfulfilling its annual raw coal production plan four months ahead of schedule, meticulously calculated three accounts to tap great potential and formulated new measures to overcome weak links. They are determined to raise the output and quality of coal to a higher level in the next four months, producing more coal for the country.

During the discussion of the plan, the workers of the Wangcang Coal Mine focused on calculating three major accounts: First, calculating the advanced level account. Currently, there are large differences in output between working faces and working faces, and between groups and groups. For example, in the four working faces of the Chenjiacen Well, two produce 300 tons per day, and two produce 200 tons per day. With the same equipment and conditions, the output differs by one-third. If the backward working faces of the entire mine are raised to or close to the production level of the advanced working faces, the coal output of the entire mine can be increased significantly. The Feng Guanggui coal mining team of the Tangjiahe Well often maintains a shift output of over 120 tons, while other teams only have about 80 tons. If all 32 coal mining teams in the mine can reach the level of this team, the output of the entire mine can be greatly improved. The workers believe that it is possible to bring the production level of backward working faces and teams up to or close to the advanced working faces and teams. Second, calculating the quality improvement account. At present, the ash content of raw coal is still relatively high. As long as comprehensive layered mining is implemented, screening is strengthened, and acceptance is strictly enforced, reducing the ash content below the national standard can relatively increase the output of more raw coal. Third, calculating the equipment utilization account. Currently, the coordination between mining, tunneling, and transportation, and the scheduling of operations inside and outside the well are prominent weak links in production. If transportation work is strengthened, and both mining and tunneling operations can use vehicles according to production needs, while also mutually adjusting and supporting each other in specific situations, accelerating vehicle turnover, and one coal car can be used as one and a half, the current shortage of coal cars can be overcome and coal production can be promoted.

After meticulously calculating these three major accounts, the workers saw the huge production potential and felt that there was much to be done in increasing production and practicing economy. They believe that as long as they continue to work hard, without adding any equipment or labor to the entire mine, the coal output can be significantly increased on the basis of the high output level in August in the next four months. After calculating the accounts from a macro perspective, the workers of the entire mine started from small aspects and took measures. They formulated plans to promote the production experience of existing advanced teams within a time limit, and launched competition in learning from, catching up with, helping, and surpassing each other. At the same time, they adopted "three selections" (selection after blasting, selection after coal removal, and selection during loading) and "four cleanliness" measures such as cleaning residual stones and cleaning chutes to vigorously improve the quality of raw coal. The entire mine also rapidly expanded roadways, strengthened underground scheduling, organized relay transportation, overcame the weak link of transportation not keeping up with mining and tunneling, so that tunneling, extraction, and transportation advanced in proportion, ensuring sustained high production.

In order to achieve the above-mentioned measures for increasing production and practicing economy, competition was launched between mines and mines, working faces and working faces, teams and teams, individuals and individuals, extraction and tunneling processes, and tunneling and transportation processes. The workers put forward the slogan of "One tops three, breaking through three barriers" (work efficiency, quality, equipment utilization), and quickly set off a high tide of increasing production and practicing economy. After the Red Flag working face and the Ten Thousand Ton working face of the Tangjia Well launched a competition, the Red Flag working face immediately sent people to the Ten Thousand Ton working face to learn the experience of five-shift operation and layered mining. From September 1st to 5th, the average daily output of the Red Flag working face increased from the original 280 tons to 318 tons. The workers of the Ten Thousand Ton working face did not dare to slack off and immediately held a meeting to study. They further adjusted the labor organization and transferred one-third of the labor force to help rush transportation. From September 1st to 5th, the average output increased from 317 tons in August to 382 tons. After the two model tunneling teams of Zeng Xianglin and Shi Yinshan of the Chenjiacen Well launched a head-to-head competition, they chased each other and refused to give in, creating high-yield records of 16 meters and 20.5 meters per day in manual tunneling, respectively. Some production teams also adopted the method of "three grasps in one shift" (grasping preparation before the shift, grasping progress during the shift, and grasping summary after the shift) in the competition, ensuring high output in every shift and every day. From September 1st to 7th, the average daily output of raw coal in the entire mine increased sharply by 15.61% compared with the last seven days of the high-yield month of August.

    提前四个月完成全年计划  细算账挖潜力继续跃进
    旺苍煤矿乘风破浪增产更多原煤
    职工深入讨论计划，找出薄弱环节，热烈开展劳动竞赛
    新华社成都电　四川省旺苍煤矿在提前四个月超额完成全年原煤生产计划的基础上，细算三笔账挖出大潜力，新定措施克服薄弱环节，决心在今后四个月内把煤炭的产量和质量提高到更高的水平，为国家多产大量的煤炭。
    旺苍煤矿职工在讨论计划中，着重算了三笔大账：第一是算先进水平账。目前全矿工作面与工作面，小组与小组之间产量差距较大，如陈家岑井四个工作面，两个日产三百吨，两个日产二百吨，设备等条件相同，产量却相差三分之一。如果全矿后进的工作面提高到或接近到先进工作面的生产水平，全矿的煤产量就可以增加很多。唐家河井冯光贵采煤小组班产经常保持在一百二十吨以上，而其他小组只有八十吨左右，如果全矿三十二个采煤小组都能提高到这个小组的水平，全矿产量就可以大大提高。职工们认为，使后进工作面和小组的生产水平，赶上或接近先进工作面和小组的生产水平，是可以做到的。第二是算提高质量账。当前原煤含?率还比较高，只要全面推行分层采，加强检选，严格验收，把含?率降低到国家标准以下，就能相对地增加更多的原煤产量。第三是算设备利用账。目前采、掘、运三者之间的协作配合和井内外调度工作，是生产上一个突出的薄弱环节。如果加强运输工作，采、掘两道工序都能按生产需要计划用车，而又在具体情况下互相调剂支援，加速车辆周转，一辆煤车可顶一辆半使用，就可以克服目前煤车不足的困难，促进煤炭的生产。
    职工们经过细算这三笔大账以后，看到了巨大的生产潜力，感到增产节约大有可为，他们认为，只要继续埋头苦干，全矿不再增添设备和劳力，今后四个月就可在8月份高产水平的基础上继续大幅度地提高煤的产量。全矿职工从大处着眼算账以后，就从小处着手，采取措施。他们定出规划，限期推广现有先进小组的生产经验，开展比、学、赶、帮竞赛。同时采取“三选”（放炮选、退炭选、装车选）和残石选干净、溜槽扫干净等“四净”措施，大力提高原煤质量。全矿还迅速扩大巷道，加强井下调度，组织接力运输，克服运输跟不上采掘这一薄弱环节，使掘进、回采、运输按比例齐头并进，保证持续高产。
    为了实现上述增产节约措施，全矿井与井、工作面与工作面、小组与小组、个人与个人、回采与掘进工序、掘进与运输工序，都互相开展了竞赛。职工们提出“一顶三，破三关”（工效、质量、设备利用）的口号，迅速掀起了增产节约竞赛高潮。唐家井红旗工作面和万吨工作面展开竞赛后，红旗工作面马上派人到万吨工作面学习五班作业和分层开采的经验。9月1日至5日，红旗工作面的平均日产量由原来二百八十吨提高到三百一十八吨。万吨工作面的工人不敢怠慢，立即开会研究。他们进一步调整了劳动组织，抽调三分之一的劳动力帮助突击运输，9月1日至5日平均产量又由8月份的三百一十七吨提高到三百八十二吨。陈家岑井曾祥林与石银山两个标兵掘进队展开对手赛后，你追我赶，互不相让，分别创造了手工掘进日进十六米和二十点五米的高产纪录。有的生产班组在竞赛中还采取一班三抓（班前抓准备、班中抓进度、班后抓总结）的方法，保证了班班高产，天天高产。9月1日至7日，全矿原煤的平均日产量比高产的8月份后七天又猛增15.61％。
