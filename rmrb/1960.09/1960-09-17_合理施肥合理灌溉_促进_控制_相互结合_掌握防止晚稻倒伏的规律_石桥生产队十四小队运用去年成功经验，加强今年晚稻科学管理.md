(Our newspaper Hangzhou 16th dispatch) The Fourteenth Squad of the Shiqiao Production Team in Tongyuan Commune, Haining County, Zhejiang Province, focusing on "fertilizer" and "water" and using a combination of promotion and control, prevented all lodging of late rice (including single-season and double-season late rice) in 1959. The rate of empty grains was only 6.8%, and the average yield per mu reached 764 jin.

　　Unveiling the Mystery of Lodging

The fact that the Fourteenth Squad's late rice did not lodge powerfully shattered the conservative idea that "rice is easy to plant, but lodging is difficult to prevent." The soil quality and irrigation conditions of this team are not very good. They started experimenting with late rice planting in 1954 and began large-scale planting in 1955. In the first year, some of the late rice lodged. To uncover the "mystery of lodging," the squad organized a group of experienced old farmers to conduct a field diagnosis. They found that the lodged late rice was distributed in fields with low terrain and surrounding water accumulation. However, another field with higher terrain and smooth drainage, which the masses called a leaky field, had no lodging, and the yield per mu reached 625 jin. During the field diagnosis, everyone also found that the lodged late rice was improperly fertilized: little base fertilizer and much topdressing, and the topdressing was mostly applied a few days after the End of Heat, resulting in the late rice leaves turning black and tender, and becoming top-heavy, causing lodging. Would the rice not lodge if topdressing was less than base fertilizer? Squad member Wu Furong discovered that a piece of late rice planted on gray swamp land in Linjiawan, which had not been applied with a single load of topdressing, grew wildly from beginning to end, but did not produce rice ears, and lodged more than ten days earlier than the surrounding rice. This series of questions caused everyone to think deeply. Finally, everyone believed that the main issue for why some late rice lodged and some did not, was whether the use of fertilizer and water was rational.

　　Finding Laws and Countermeasures

In 1956, the Fourteenth Squad planted 224 mu of late rice. At that time, many people worried that the late rice would lodge again. In this situation, Communist Party member Wu Furong and squad members Weng Tianfa and Wu Guantong first started an experiment on preventing late rice lodging in Duituo. They selected three fields of the same size (0.7 mu) in the same field as experimental fields, one of which was a "抽心田" (chouxintian), and the other two were high fields. Based on the characteristics of the high groundwater level and deep soil layer in this area, they adopted different methods of draining the fields. The chouxintian field was never drained after planting. The two high fields were drained twice: once after the second weeding, for three to five days, until hairline cracks appeared; the other time was when 80% of the late rice was heading and 20% to 30% was flowering. The results showed that the chouxintian field that was not drained lodged before the rice ears were fully drawn, and the yield per mu was only 528 jin; the two high fields that were drained twice had straight rice stalks, did not lodge, and the yield per mu was 786 jin.

The experiment on preventing late rice lodging conducted by Wu Fucai and others aroused everyone's interest. From 1957, the Fourteenth Squad, with Party members Wu Xiren and Wu Furong as the core, organized a "Late Rice Lodging Prevention Research Group," which included the squad leader, key members of the squad, and experienced old farmers.

　　"Promotion" and "Control" Go Hand in Hand

Over the past five years, the Fourteenth Squad's experience in preventing late rice lodging has become increasingly rich. Their most important experience is to focus on "fertilizer" and "water" and use the methods of "promotion" and "control" to prevent late rice lodging. "Promotion" means seizing the period from the Beginning of Autumn to the White Dew, focusing on rational fertilization, and grasping field management early and firmly to promote early and uniform development of late rice, developing fully and well, growing strong, with thick and hard stalks, and enhancing lodging resistance. Taking 1959 as an example, the first application of seedling fertilizer was applied at the Beginning of Autumn, with eight to ten loads of human manure per mu, mainly to promote early greening; the second application of tillering fertilizer was applied seventeen or eighteen days after planting, before the second weeding, with twenty loads of pig and sheep ash per mu; the third application of ear fertilizer was applied at the end of August, with five or six jin of "fertile field powder" or ten loads of human manure. In addition to the above three applications, granular fertilizer should be applied appropriately to late rice with poor field conditions. "Control" means seizing the right time to effectively control various factors that are unfavorable to late rice lodging prevention. In addition to controlling the amount of nitrogen fertilizer applied in the later stage and rationally increasing the application of phosphorus and potassium fertilizer, the main method is draining the fields, especially emphasizing draining during the flowering period. The general principle is to drain the fields frequently and skillfully, keeping the flowers dry and the grains moist. The method is to generally bake the fields twice. The first time is at the end of August, during the late stage of rice tillering and the beginning of round stem elongation, drain the fields until hairline cracks appear. The second time is at the Autumnal Equinox, when 80% of the rice seedlings are heading and 20% to 30% are flowering, drain the fields and bake them, generally for four days.

The squad members believe that this baking is very important. Even poor rice seedlings or inconvenient water conservancy conditions should be baked once. Each time the fields are baked, it is necessary to check the fields and the seedlings. If the rice seedlings are poor, the field conditions are not good, and the water conservancy conditions are poor, simply loosening the base of the bunds is sufficient. Over-baking should be avoided, as it often easily leads to lodging. They believe that late rice lodging prevention should start from the beginning and should not be relaxed even in the later stages. The combination of "promotion" and "control" will yield obvious results.

Now, the members of the Fourteenth Squad are using this set of experiences to scientifically manage late rice, strive to continue to achieve the success of preventing all late rice from lodging this year, and further enrich and improve the experience of preventing late rice lodging.

    合理施肥合理灌溉　“促进”“控制”相互结合
    掌握防止晚稻倒伏的规律
    石桥生产队十四小队运用去年成功经验，加强今年晚稻科学管理
    本报杭州16日电　浙江海宁县通元公社石桥生产队十四小队，采取紧抓“肥、水”二字，用促进和控制相结合的办法，1959年这个队的晚稻（包括单季晚稻和双季晚稻）全部不倒伏，晚稻秕谷率只有6.8 ％，平均亩产达到七百六十四斤。
      揭开倒伏之谜
    十四小队晚稻不倒伏的事实有力地打破了“水稻好种、倒伏难防”的保守思想。这个队的土质、灌溉等条件都不很好，1954年开始试种晚稻，到1955年才大面积种植。头一年种的晚稻，有一些倒伏了。为了揭开“倒伏之谜”，小队组织了一批有经验的老农踏畈会诊。他们发现倒伏的晚稻都分布在地势低、四周积水的田里。而另一片田地势较高，排水畅快，群众称为漏水田的那一畈田，却一块稻都没有倒伏，亩产达到六百二十五斤。在踏畈会诊中，大家还发现倒伏的晚稻施肥不当：基肥少、追肥多，追肥的时间又大都在处暑后几天，结果到后期稻叶发黑发嫩，头重脚轻，造成倒伏。是不是追肥比基肥少的就不倒伏？社员吴富荣发现林家浜的一块种在灰潭地基上的晚稻，没有施过一担追肥，稻苗自始至终疯长，却不出稻穗，比四周水稻早十多天就倒伏了。这一连串的问题引起了大家的深思。最后大家认为：晚稻有的倒，有的不倒，主要问题是用肥、用水合理不合理。
    寻规律　找对策
    1956年，十四小队种晚稻二百二十四亩。当时，许多人担心晚稻再倒。在这种情况下，共产党员吴富荣与社员翁天法、吴关通两人，首先在对石驼搞起了晚稻防倒伏的试验。他们选择了同畈的三丘七分大小的田作为试验田，其中一丘是抽心田，两丘是高田。并且针对本地区地下水位较高，土层深厚的特点，采取了不同的搁田方法。抽心田种后一直没有放过水，也没有搁过田。而两丘高田先后经过两次搁田：一次是在耘二遍田以后，搁了三、五天，到有鸡毛裂为止；另一次是在有80％的晚稻抽穗、20％到30％扬花时搁田。试验结果没有搁田的那丘抽心田，稻穗没有抽齐就倒伏了，亩产只有五百二十八斤；搁田两次的两丘高田稻秆挺直，始终不倒，亩产七百八十六斤。
    吴富菜等搞的晚稻不倒伏的试验，引起了大家的兴趣。从1957年起，十四小队以党员吴西仁、吴富荣等为核心，组织了“晚稻防倒伏研究小组”，小队长、小队的骨干和有经验的老农民都参加了。
  “促进”“控制”双管齐下
    五年来，十四小队晚稻防倒的经验越来越丰富，他们最重要的经验就是抓住“肥”、“水”二字，用“促进”和“控制”的办法来达到防止晚稻倒伏。“促进”就是要抓住立秋到白露这段时机，以合理施肥为中心，早抓狠抓田间管理，促使晚稻早发匀发，发足发好，生长健壮，秆粗秆硬，增强抗倒性。以1959年为例，第一次在“立秋”边施苗肥，每亩施人粪八到十担，主要是促进早转青；第二次在种后十七、八天，第二次耘田前施发棵肥，每亩施猪羊灰二十担；第三次在8月底施穗肥，施用肥田粉五、六斤，或人粪十担。除以上三次外，对田脚差的晚稻还要适当施用粒肥。“控制”就是抓住火候，有力地控制对晚稻防倒不利的各种因素。除了控制后期氮肥施用量，合理增施磷钾肥以外，主要是搁田，特别重视花期搁田。总的原则是勤搁田、巧搁田，干花湿子。方法是普遍烤田两次，第一次在8月底，稻苗发棵末期、开始圆秆拔节时进行搁田，到田里有鸡毛裂为止。第二次在秋分，80％稻苗抽穗，20％到30％扬花时排水烤田，一般要烤四天。
    社员们认为这次烤田很重要，稻苗差，水利不便的也要烤田一次。在每次烤田时，都要看田看苗搁田。如稻苗差，田脚不糊，水利条件差的只要脱脱岸脚就可以了。烤田不能过头，过头了往往容易引起倒伏。他们认为，晚稻防倒要从头抓起，越到后期越不放松，“促进”和“控制”双管齐下，见效才会明显。
    现在，十四小队的队员们正运用这一套经验，科学地管理晚稻，争取今年继续取得全部晚稻不倒伏的成就，并进一步充实和丰富晚稻防倒伏的经验。
