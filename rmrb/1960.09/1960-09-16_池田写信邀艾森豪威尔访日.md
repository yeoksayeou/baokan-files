Xinhua News Agency, Washington, 15th: White House Press Secretary Hagerty revealed on the 13th that Japan's new Prime Minister Ikeda has invited US President Eisenhower to visit Japan to make up for the embarrassment of being rebuffed by the Japanese people this June. Hagerty confirmed news reports that Japanese Foreign Minister Kosaka, who is currently visiting the United States, handed a letter from Ikeda to Eisenhower to the US State Department. In the letter, Ikeda expressed "regret" that Eisenhower was unable to visit Japan this June, and expressed his hope that he would make another visit. Hagerty said that these reports were correct. He also said that Eisenhower would probably respond soon.
