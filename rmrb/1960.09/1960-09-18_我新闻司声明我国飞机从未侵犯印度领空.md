    Indian Ministry of External Affairs Makes Baseless Accusations and Protests
    Foreign Ministry Information Department Statement: Our Aircraft Have Never Violated Indian Airspace
    Chinese Government Expresses Deep Regret over This Unfriendly Act by India
    Reiterates Suggestion that Both Sides Remain Vigilant Against Unidentified Aircraft Flying Over the Border
    Xinhua News Agency, September 17th: A spokesperson for the Information Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China today issued the following statement regarding the so-called Chinese aircraft violating Indian airspace:
     On August 22, 1960, the Chinese Embassy in India received a note from the Indian Ministry of External Affairs protesting the so-called violation of Indian airspace by aircraft from the Tibet region of China. On August 24th, Indian Defense Minister Menon announced in the People's Assembly that the Indian government had protested to the Chinese government regarding the so-called violation of Indian airspace. The explanation attached to the note from the Indian Ministry of External Affairs listed 52 incidents of airspace violation. The Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs replied to the Indian Embassy in China on September 16th, stating that after investigation by the Chinese government, no Chinese aircraft had ever flown into Indian airspace. Therefore, the Chinese government rejected the Indian government's protest. The Foreign Ministry Information Department spokesperson was instructed to clarify the facts and set the record straight.
    In early April 1960, the Indian government informed the Chinese government that aircraft had been detected flying in the Sino-Indian border area. During Premier Zhou Enlai's visit to India in April, he told Prime Minister Nehru during the talks on April 25th that after investigation by the Chinese government, these aircraft were American. They took off from Bangkok, passed over Burma or China, flew across the Sino-Indian border, and infiltrated the Chinese mainland to a great depth, airdropping Chiang Kai-shek gang secret agents, weapons, supplies, and radios, and then flew back to Bangkok over the Sino-Indian border. Premier Zhou Enlai assured Prime Minister Nehru at the time that the Chinese government would never allow its aircraft to fly across the border, and said that the Chinese government had notified the Burmese government, mentioning that if Burma detected aircraft of unknown nationality in its airspace, Burma had the full right to handle them, either by forcing them to land or shooting them down. China would do the same if it detected such aircraft in its airspace. Premier Zhou Enlai also expressed his belief that India would do the same. Subsequently, in a note to the Indian Embassy in China on April 26th, the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs further emphasized: "The Chinese government is clearly aware that there is currently a force that is deliberately provoking relations between China and its southwestern neighbors in various ways. Especially when the Chinese and Indian Prime Ministers are seeking a peaceful solution to the Sino-Indian border issue, they are likely to use aircraft invading India or China to achieve the purpose of undermining Sino-Indian relations. In this regard, it is hoped that the Indian government and the Chinese government will be jointly vigilant." It is noteworthy that among the 52 incidents of alleged Chinese aircraft violating Indian airspace listed in the Indian Ministry of External Affairs' note of August 22nd, only May 31st, June 6th, and June 15th occurred after Premier Zhou Enlai's visit to India, while the remaining dates were before Premier Zhou Enlai's visit to India this April. The Chinese government is deeply surprised that, after Premier Zhou Enlai and the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs made clear explanations to Prime Minister Nehru and the Indian government, the Indian Ministry of External Affairs still disregarded the facts and once again raised baseless accusations and protests against the Chinese government in its note of August 22nd, which cannot but be regarded as a very unfriendly act towards the People's Republic of China. The Chinese government expresses its deep regret over this. In its reply to India on September 16th, the Chinese government, out of a desire to safeguard the friendly relations between China and India, once again suggested that, in order to prevent external forces from deliberately undermining Sino-Indian relations, both sides should remain vigilant against incidents of aircraft of unknown nationality flying over the border between the two countries, and notify each other in a timely manner so that they can take necessary measures separately.

    印度外交部对我提出毫无事实根据的指责和抗议
    我新闻司声明我国飞机从未侵犯印度领空
    我国政府对印度这一很不友好的行为表示深切的遗憾
    再次建议双方对不明国籍的飞机飞越两国边境保持警惕
    新华社17日讯　中华人民共和国外交部新闻司发言人今天就所谓中国飞机侵犯印度领空事发表声明如下：
     1960年8月22日我国驻印度大使馆收到印度外交部照会一件，抗议所谓来自中国西藏地方的飞机侵犯印度领空。8月24日，印度国防部长梅农在人民院宣布，印度政府已就所谓侵犯印度领空事件，向中国政府提出抗议。印度外交部来照所附说明中列举侵犯领空事件五十二起。我国外交部于9月16日复照印度驻华大使馆，说明经过中国政府调查，根本没有发生过中国飞机飞入印度领空的事实。因此，中国政府拒绝了印度政府的抗议。外交部新闻司发言人奉命说明事实真相，以正视听。
    1960年4月初，印度政府曾经通知中国政府，在中印边境发现有飞机飞行。4月间周恩来总理访问印度期间，曾在4月25日的会谈中告诉过尼赫鲁总理，经中国政府查明，这些飞机是美国的。它们从曼谷起飞，经过缅甸或中国上空，飞越中印边境，向中国内地深入，空降蒋帮特务、武器、物资和电台，然后又经过中印边境上空飞回曼谷。周恩来总理当时向尼赫鲁总理保证，中国政府决不允许自己的飞机飞越边界，并且说中国政府已照会缅甸政府，其中提到，缅甸如果在自己的领空发现国籍不明的飞机，缅甸完全有权处理，或者迫降，或者击落。中国如果在自己的领空发现这种飞机，也将同样处理。周恩来总理当时还表示相信印度也会这样做。接着，中国外交部在4月26日致印度驻华大使馆的照会中，又强调指出：“中国政府清楚地知道，目前存在着这样一种势力，他们蓄意从各方面来挑拨中国同它西南邻邦的关系。尤其当中印两国总理正在设法谋求和平解决中印边界问题的时候，他们很可能借飞机侵入印度或中国来达到破坏中印关系的目的。对此，希望印度政府和中国政府共同警惕。”值得注意的是，印度外交部8月22日照会所列举的所谓中国飞机侵犯印度领空事件五十二起的时间中，除5月31日、6月6日和6月15日三个日期是在周恩来总理访问印度之后，其余的日期都在周恩来总理今年4月访问印度之前。中国政府深感惊异的是，在周恩来总理和中国外交部向尼赫鲁总理和印度政府做了清楚的说明以后，印度外交部竟仍然不顾事实真相，在8月22日的照会中再次向中国政府提出毫无事实根据的指责和抗议，这不能不被认为是对中华人民共和国很不友好的行为。中国政府对此表示深切的遗憾。在9月16日给印度的复照中，中国政府从维护中印两国友好关系的愿望出发，再一次建议，为了防止外来的对中印两国关系的蓄意破坏，双方对不明国籍的飞机飞越两国边境的事件保持警惕，并且及时地互相通知，以便分别采取必要的措施。
