　　Mother Pigs Producing Three Litters a Year

　　Kim Eun-shil, a breeder at the Dongheung Agricultural Cooperative in Inheung County, Hamgyeongnam-do, Democratic People's Republic of Korea, has achieved excellent results with mother pigs generally producing three litters a year.

　　She selected a total of thirteen sows for the experiment. To ensure three litters a year, it was essential to ensure normal development of the sows. To this end, she drew up a schedule for caring for the sows in the early and late stages of pregnancy, carefully feeding them so that the sows would be in heat within a week after giving birth, and the piglets would be weaned in forty to forty-three days. As a result of the experiment, all sows achieved three litters a year.

　　Ten Turn Into Seven Thousand One Hundred

　　Jang Il-soon, a rabbit breeder at the Samsu Breeding Farm in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, achieved the outstanding result of breeding seven thousand one hundred young rabbits from ten does in one year.

　　In Korea, does used to generally breed five to six litters a year, but Jang Il-soon experimented with delivering twelve litters a year. She gave special care to the young rabbits and weak rabbits, feeding them wax tofu instead of green grass. In addition, she also used some folk remedies to prevent rabbit diseases, such as using scallions and artemisia to prevent coccidiosis. Because of her meticulous care, the survival rate of the rabbits she raised reached 100%.

　　Adding Trace Elements

　　The Latvian Institute of Animal Husbandry and Veterinary Science in the Soviet Union has found that if the content of trace elements in cattle is low, they are susceptible to tuberculosis. Therefore, adding trace elements to cattle can increase their resistance to tuberculosis.

　　The institute found that the serum of cattle suffering from tuberculosis contains significantly less of certain trace elements than that of healthy cattle. The incidence of tuberculosis is highest in sandy, podzolic, and peat land areas, and the feed grown in these areas lacks many trace elements, such as cobalt, manganese, copper, and iodine. Preliminary tests have shown that after adding a comprehensive preparation of trace element salts, the blood composition of cattle improves, and their ability to resist tuberculosis is strengthened.

　　“Corpan”

　　Some feed and serum factories in the German Democratic Republic have produced a preparation called "Corpan." This preparation, plus some concentrated feed, can be used to feed calves, saving some milk and reducing feeding costs.

　　"Corpan" is a preparation containing tetracycline antibiotics, vitamins A, D2, B, E and trace elements. In the German Democratic Republic, it generally takes 400 kg of whole milk and 600 kg of skim milk to raise a calf. With "Corpan," only 200 kg of whole milk and 200 kg of skim milk, plus some refined hay and oats, are enough, thus reducing feeding costs by two-fifths.

　　Promote Artificial Insemination of Livestock

　　Czechoslovakia has made great achievements in promoting artificial insemination of livestock. Currently, 80% of cows in Czechoslovakia are impregnated by artificial insemination. The blood types of all breeding bulls in the country have also been investigated. To ensure the planned development of artificial insemination, the relevant authorities have also established a central storage center to store the semen of the best breeding bulls at very low temperatures so that it can be retrieved and used at any time.

　　The Zhergalantu State Farm in the Mongolian People's Republic not only vigorously increases the number of cattle and sheep, but also raises many pigs. This is Balchin, an excellent breeder, and the pigs he raises.

    兄弟国家畜牧业集锦
      母猪一年三产
    朝鲜民主主义人民共和国咸镜南道仁兴郡东兴农业合作社饲养员金银实饲养的母猪普遍取得了一年三产的优异成绩。
    她一共选了十三头母猪进行试验。为了保证一年三产，必须保证母猪正常发育，为此她订出了母猪怀孕前期和后期照料日程表，仔细饲养，使母猪下崽后一个星期内发情，猪崽在四十天到四十三天就离奶。试验结果，所有母猪都达到了一年三产的成绩。
  十只变成七千一百只
    朝鲜民主主义人民共和国三水种畜场养兔员张一顺取得了十只母兔一年繁殖七千一百只小兔的优异成绩。
    在朝鲜，过去母兔一般是一年繁殖五胎到六胎，但张一顺却试行了一年分娩十二胎。对仔兔以及瘦弱的兔子，她给予了特别的照料，不喂青草，而喂以蜡豆腐。此外，她还采用一些民间药方防治兔子疾病，例如用葱和蒿草预防球虫病等。由于她这样的悉心饲养，她所饲养的兔子的成活率达到了100％。
    加喂微量元素
    苏联拉脱维亚畜牧和兽医科学研究所发现，如果牛的体内微量元素含量较少，就易感染结核病，因此，给牛加喂微量元素，可增加其对结核病的抗疫性。
    这个研究所发现，患结核病的牛的血清中某些微量元素含量比健康的牛少很多。在沙土、灰化土和泥炭土地带，结核病发病率最高，而这些地区生长的饲料缺少许多种微量元素，如钴、锰、铜和碘等。初步试验表明，加喂微量元素盐综合制剂后，牛的血液成分改善了，抗结核病能力也就加强了。
        “可尔胖”
    德意志民主共和国一些饲料和血清厂制成了一种叫“可尔胖”的制剂，这种制剂加上一些精饲料就可以喂小牛，节省一部分牛奶，而且可以降低饲养成本。
      “可尔胖”是含有四圜素属抗菌素、维生素A、D2、B、E和微量元素的制剂。德意志民主共和国一般把一头小牛喂大，需要四百公斤全脂奶和六百公斤脱脂奶。采用“可尔胖”以后，只要用二百公斤全脂奶和二百公斤脱脂奶和一些精制干草和燕麦就够了，饲养成本因而降低了五分之二。
  推广牲畜人工授精
    捷克斯洛伐克在推广牲畜的人工授精方面获得了很大的成就。目前捷克斯洛伐克全国有80％的母牛是用人工授精法怀孕的。全国所有种牛的血型也已经调查清楚。为了保证有计划地发展人工授精，有关机关还设立了一个中央储存所，在非常低的温度下储存最好的种牛的精液，以便在任何时候都可以取出使用。（附图片）
    蒙古人民共和国热尔加兰图国营农牧场除大力增殖牛、羊以外，还饲养了很多猪。这是优秀饲养员巴尔钦和他饲养的猪。
