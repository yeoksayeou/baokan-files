Xinhua News Agency, Leopoldville, September 15th: The Congolese government, with the support of the people, has once again smashed an imperialist plot to overthrow the legitimate Congolese government. The Congolese government officially announced in a communique today that the Congolese government and army have arrested Colonel Mobutu, the Chief of Staff of the Congolese army, who was bought off by imperialists and plotted to overthrow the legitimate Congolese government.

Mobutu suddenly announced yesterday evening that he had taken over the government and would hold the powers of the President and Prime Minister until December 1960. He later claimed at a press conference that he would pursue a pro-Western policy. He requested American and British "technicians" to come to the Congo to help him, and clamored for the Soviet and Czechoslovakian diplomatic personnel in the Congo to leave the Congo within forty-eight hours. Mobutu also stated that the Congolese army would continue to rely on the United Nations and said that the Congolese army, which was fighting against the secessionist groups of Kalonji and Tshombe, should "cease fire".

However, Mobutu's actions, apart from being supported by imperialists and Western propaganda machines, did not receive the support of the Congolese people and soldiers. Just as Mobutu was holding a press conference, the crowd outside was seething. Many Congolese people shouted slogans such as "Down with Mobutu!"

The communique issued by the Congolese government stated that the central government of the Republic of the Congo announced to the people that the Army Chief of Staff, Colonel Mobutu, bought off by imperialists, had launched a coup against our legitimate and people's government. Fortunately, after Mobutu delivered a radio address, the Congolese National Army rose up and thwarted his plot to launch a coup. Congolese soldiers immediately came to see Prime Minister Lumumba, responsible for protecting him from any attacks by imperialists.

The communique pointed out that Mobutu's coup was "a plot aimed at placing the Congo back under the rule of an international organization."

Xinhua News Agency, Leopoldville, September 14th: Congolese Prime Minister Lumumba delivered a speech to the nation on the Congolese National Radio on the 14th, calling on the country to unite and fight against imperialism to defend the independence and unity of the motherland.

Prime Minister Lumumba said to the people of the country in his broadcast, "Our country has experienced unfortunate events, and some people have attempted to overthrow your government by undemocratic means. The parliament, as the supreme organ of power, made rulings on September 7th and 8th respectively. The two houses of the legislature have once again expressed their complete trust in the government led by me, which represents the will of the people. On September 12th, another coup was instigated, and I was illegally arrested."

He said, "Legality and law are our only guidelines. The people trust us, we are unwilling to betray the people of the whole country, and we will always stand by your side."

He also said, "The Senate and House of Representatives held a joint meeting yesterday and voted to grant the government full powers. We will exercise this power in accordance with the will of the parliament. Here, I especially want to pay tribute to the members of the Senate and House of Representatives, because they wisely and brilliantly deliberated on national affairs. They certainly live up to the people's trust in them."

Lumumba said: "Bolikango (the 'Minister of Information' of the illegal Ileo government) sneaked into the broadcasting room of the National Radio yesterday when the person in charge was not there and delivered a speech instigating the people to oppose the legally established government. What Bolikango said is completely invalid. Contrary to what he claimed himself yesterday, he is not the Minister of Information at all."

Prime Minister Lumumba emphasized: "The government led by me, in accordance with the will of the whole country and the parliament, is your only government, and this government vigorously safeguards your interests."

The Congolese National Radio in Leopoldville has resumed normal broadcasting today after being closed for a week due to an illegal decision made by the United Nations authorities.

Local people are excitedly talking about the resumption of broadcasting by their own radio station, which they see as a preliminary victory in the struggle of the Congolese people against the imperialist conspiracy against their national government.

Xinhua News Agency, Leopoldville, September 13th: Congolese newspapers continue to publish commentaries condemning the US-manipulated "United Nations" for interfering in the internal affairs of the Congo.

The People's Party's "Liberation" weekly published a commentary saying: "We strongly state that we do not want Americans in the Congo." The commentary said that we can no longer "tolerate any plunder."

The commentary expressed support for the Lumumba government and expressed confidence that the Congolese people "will be able to get rid of the control of our territory by the imperialists of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization." The commentary continued: At that time, "our huge resources will no longer be plundered and enriched by the shameless capitalists of Belgium, the United States, and other countries."

The commentary called on the Congolese people to be vigilant and called on all Congolese nationalist parties to "work together and intensify unity in a broad Congolese patriotic front that includes all the vital forces of the country."

A commentary published by the "Congo Daily" on the 10th also expressed support for the Congolese government headed by Prime Minister Lumumba and refuted the Western cliche that the Lumumba government "is no longer a legitimate government." The commentary said that whether people like it or not, the current Prime Minister is the only person who can now get a majority in parliament and win popular support.

An editorial published by the same newspaper on the same day pointed out that the recent resolution passed by the Congolese Senate with an overwhelming majority against Kasavubu's illegal order to dismiss Prime Minister Lumumba "shows that the national masses and the country's parliamentarians trust the current government."

    刚果政府粉碎帝国主义又一颠复阴谋
    政府军已逮捕阴谋推翻政府的军队参谋长蒙博托上校
    卢蒙巴号召人民团结反对帝国主义保卫祖国独立统一
    新华社利奥波德维尔15日电刚果政府在人民支持下又一次粉碎了帝国主义者企图推翻刚果合法政府的政变阴谋。刚果政府今天在一项公报中正式宣布，刚果政府和军队今天已经逮捕了受到帝国主义收买、阴谋推翻刚果合法政府的刚果军队参谋长蒙博托上校。
    蒙博托在昨天晚间突然宣布他接管了政府，并执掌总统和总理的权力，直到1960年12月为止。他稍后在记者招待会上声称他将奉行亲西方政策。他要求美国和英国的“技术人员”到刚果来帮助他，并且叫嚣要苏联和捷克斯洛伐克等社会主义国家驻刚果外交人员在四十八小时离开刚果。蒙博托还表示，刚果军队将继续依靠联合国，并说要正在讨伐卡隆吉和冲伯分裂集团的刚果军队“停火”。
    但是，蒙博托这一行动除了受到帝国主义者和西方的宣传机器的支持以外，并没有得到刚果人民和士兵的支持。就在蒙博托举行记者招待会的时候，屋外群情沸腾。许多刚果人高呼“打倒蒙博托！”的口号。
    刚果政府发表的公报说，刚果共和国中央政府向人民宣布，陆军参谋长蒙博托上校受帝国主义者收买，对我国合法的和人民的政府发动政变。值得庆幸的是，在蒙博托发表广播演说之后，刚果国民军群起挫败了他发动政变的阴谋。刚果士兵立即前来见卢蒙巴总理，负责保卫他免受帝国主义者的任何袭击。
    公报指出，蒙博托的政变是“目的在于把刚果重新置于一个国际组织的统治之下的阴谋”。
    新华社利奥波德维尔14日电刚果总理卢蒙巴14日在刚果国家电台向全国人民发表演说，号召全国团结起来同帝国主义进行斗争以保卫祖国的独立和统一。
    卢蒙巴总理在广播中向全国人民说，“我国经历了不幸的事件，有人企图用反民主的手段推翻你们的政府。作为最高权力机关的议会，已分别于9月7日和8日作出了裁决。立法机构的两院再一次表示完全信任代表人民意志的我所领导的政府。9月12日，又有人策动政变，对我进行非法的逮捕。”
    他说，“法制和法律是我们的唯一准则。人民信任我们，我们不愿意背弃全国人民，我们将永远站在你们这一边。”
    他又说，“（刚果）参众两院昨天举行了联席会议，表决通过授予政府以全权。我们将秉承议会的意志来行使这种权力。在这里，我尤其要向参众两院的议员们致敬，因为他们明智而英明地审议了国家大事。他们的确不辜负人民对他们的信任。”
    卢蒙巴说：“博利康果（伊利奥非法政府的“新闻部长”）昨天乘负责人不在的时候，潜入国家电台的广播室，发表了煽动人民反对依法建立的政府的讲话。博利康果所说的话是完全无效的。同他昨天自己所声称的相反，他根本不是新闻部长。”
    卢蒙巴总理强调：“我秉承全国和议会的意志领导的政府，是你们的唯一的政府，这个政府有力地维护着你们的利益。”
    利奥波德维尔的刚果国家电台在联合国当局作出非法决定而封闭一周以后今天已经恢复正常广播。
    当地人民兴奋地谈论着他们自己的电台恢复广播，他们认为这是刚果人民同帝国主义反对他们民族 政府的阴谋所进行的斗争的初步胜利。
    新华社利奥波德维尔13日电　刚果报纸继续发表评论，谴责美国操纵的“联合国”干涉刚果内政。
    人民党的“解放”周刊发表评论说：“我们强有力地表示，我们在刚果不要美国佬。”评论说，我们再也“不能容忍任何掠夺”。
    评论表示支持卢蒙巴政府，并且表示相信，刚果人民“将能摆脱北大西洋公约组织的帝国主义者对我国领土的控制”。评论接着说：到那时，“我国的巨大富源，将不再为比利时、美国和其他国家的无耻资本家们所掠夺和发财致富”。
    评论号召刚果人民提高警惕，并呼吁刚果一切民族主义政党“同心协力，加紧团结在将把国家的一切有生力量包括在内的广泛的刚果爱国阵线中”。
    “刚果日报”10日发表的评论，也表示支持以总理卢蒙巴为首的刚果政府，并且驳斥西方诬蔑卢蒙巴政府“不再是合法政府”的滥调。评论说，不管人家愿意不愿意，现任总理是现在唯一能在议会中得到多数而孚众望的人物。
    这家报纸同一天发表的社论中指出，最近刚果参议院以压倒多数通过决议反对卡萨武布非法宣布解除卢蒙巴总理职务的命令，“这就表明全国人民群众和国家的议员们信任现政府”。
