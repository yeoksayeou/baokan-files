    Yongning County Improves Leadership Methods to Vigorously Promote Agricultural Production
    Thirty Percent of Cadres Remain in Agencies, Thirty Percent Go to the Front Lines to Gain Broad Experience, Forty Percent Settle Down in Rural Areas
    Various Institutions and Enterprises Vigorously Engage in Technical Innovation, Saving Manpower and Resources, and Actively Serving Agriculture in Many Ways
    Editor's Note: To conscientiously implement the policy of taking agriculture as the foundation, vigorously develop agriculture, and vigorously develop grain production, it is very important for cadres to go deep into the front line of agriculture, participate in production, and lead production.
    Yongning County has taken a series of measures in this regard: adjusting organizational structures, improving working methods, and resolutely implementing the "three-three-four system," that is: 30% of cadres remain in agencies to work, 30% of cadres form work groups to go deep into the front line to gain broad experience, and 40% of cadres are sent down to settle down in rural communes, brigades, and teams for a long time. In this way, the three are combined with each other, enabling them to better understand the situation, connect with the masses, better implement the Party's policies, and strengthen the leadership of agricultural production. This approach can be used as a reference for various localities.

    (Our report) Yinchuan, Ningxia – In order to implement the policy of taking agriculture as the foundation, Yongning County, Ningxia Autonomous Region, with a bold revolutionary spirit, has sent down a large number of cadres to the grassroots level to effectively strengthen the leadership of the agricultural front.
    The specific measures taken by Yongning County are: On the basis of implementing the "two-five system," county-level agency cadres further implement the "three-three-four system," that is, 30% of the cadres remain in the agencies to work; 30% of the cadres form work groups based on production brigades, go deep into the front line of production, and gain broad experience; 40% of the cadres are sent down to communes, brigades, and production teams to settle down for a long time. Among the cadres sent down, there are cadres above the section chief level and many Party and League members. In addition to some leading cadres serving as Party general branch secretaries of the brigades, the vast majority are sent down to the production teams to serve as deputy secretaries of the Party branches or deputy team leaders. Most of the cadres sent down go to backward communes and teams. The county Party committee requires everyone to make up their minds to train a group of strong cadres in two or three years and completely change the face of backward communes and teams. In this way, the cadres sent down by the county and the cadres who form work groups and regularly go deep into the front line account for 70.2% of the county-level administrative cadres, of which Party and League members account for 60%.
    Now, the workload of the 30% of cadres who remain in the agencies has increased accordingly. In order to ensure that the work of the agencies can proceed normally, the county Party committee, according to the business nature of each unit, decided to establish three combined offices with the Party, mass organizations, political and legal affairs, and finance and trade departments as units. The thirty-two departments under the three departments formed eleven combined office groups, implemented combined offices, one person taking on multiple positions, and everyone becoming versatile to do a good job in the work of the agencies.
    In order to concentrate efforts to strengthen the agricultural front, some people were also drawn from various enterprises and institutions to participate in agricultural production. The total number of employees and training classes and middle school students in the county's commerce, industry, transportation, grain, culture, education, and health systems accounts for 7.8% of the county's total labor force. In order to give full play to the role of these people and better serve agricultural production, the following measures are taken according to the different characteristics of these departments:
    First, vigorously carry out technical innovation and technical revolution movements, improve labor productivity, save manpower, meet the needs of new enterprises, and achieve no increase in personnel for factory construction and increased production with labor saving. According to preliminary estimates, the commerce, industry, transportation, and grain departments alone can draw 12.3% of the existing employees of enterprises and institutions. In addition to solving the employment problems of the three new enterprises that directly serve agriculture, more than 160 people can be transferred to agricultural production.
    Second, change the layout and management system of commercial, health, and other enterprises and institutions. Only 34.8% of the county's commercial employees (excluding administrative personnel and industrial employees) are now working in brigades; only 47% of the county's health system's employees are in communes and brigades. The number of enterprise and institution personnel who go deep into rural areas is not only small, but the quality is also poor, which is not in line with the current production. According to these circumstances, it was decided to implement the "three-seven system," that is, about 30% of commercial and medical personnel will remain in towns, and about 70% of commercial and medical personnel will move to rural areas, requiring them to do three things: First, expand the distribution stores set up in the brigades into comprehensive stores, do a good job in the supply of production and living materials and the purchase of agricultural and sideline products; rectify and strengthen existing health centers, and set up simple hospital beds. Second, organize canteen cooks or administrators to purchase and sell on behalf of others, help the canteens do a good job in the service department, facilitate the masses to purchase odds and ends of daily necessities and sell odds and ends of sideline products; in addition to going deep into the front line for mobile medical treatment, the brigade health centers must also help the production teams to do a good job in canteen hygiene and establish health care rooms. Third, combine with business to participate in agricultural production for a certain period of time, and eat, live, work, and discuss matters with commune members.
    After studying and raising their awareness, the cadres and employees of the county-level agencies in Yongning County have successively written application letters and letters of determination, requesting the organization to approve them to go down to the front line of production and settle down in rural areas for a long time to vigorously develop agriculture and vigorously develop grain production. Some of the cadres who have been approved to go down have already taken up new jobs and devoted themselves to agricultural production.

    永宁县改进领导方法狠抓农业生产
    干部十分之三留机关工作，十分之三蹲点转面，十分之四到农村落户
    各事业和企业单位大搞技术革新，节约人力物力，从多方面积极为农业服务
    编者按：要认真贯彻执行以农业为基础的方针，大办农业，大办粮食，很重要的一条是干部深入农业第一线，参加生产，领导生产。
    永宁县在这方面采取了一系列的措施：调整组织机构，改进工作方法，坚决实行“三三四制”，即：30％的干部留机关工作，30％的干部组成工作组深入第一线蹲点转面，40％的干部下放到农村落户。这样，三者互相结合，就能更深入地了解情况，联系群众，更好地贯彻党的政策，加强农业生产的领导。这种做法可供各地参考。

    本报讯　宁夏自治区永宁县为了贯彻执行以农业为基础的方针，以大刀阔斧的革命精神，下放大批干部到基层，切实加强农业战线的领导。
    永宁县采取的具体措施是：在实行“二五制”的基础上，县级机关干部进一步实行“三、三、四制”，即30％的干部留机关工作；30％的干部以生产大队为单位组成工作组，深入生产第一线，蹲点转面；40％的干部下放到公社、大队、小队长期落户。下放的干部中，有科长级以上的干部和很多党团员。除了部分领导骨干担任大队党总支书记外，绝大多数下放到小队担任党支部副书记或副队长。下放的干部绝大部分是到后进的社、队。县委要求大家到下边去以后，要下决心在两三年内培养出一批坚强的干部，把落后社、队的面貌彻底改变过来。这样，全县下放的干部和组成工作组经常深入第一线的干部，就占县级机关行政干部的70.2％，其中党、团员占60％。
    现在，留在机关工作的30％的干部，工作量就相应地增加。为了使机关工作能够正常地进行，县委根据各单位的业务性质，决定以党群、政法、财贸三个口为单位，成立三个合署办公室，三个口所属的三十二个部门，成立十一个合署办公小组，实行合署办公，一人兼多职，人人成为多面手，做好机关工作。
    为了集中力量加强农业战线，又从各企、事业单位中抽出一部分人参加农业生产。全县商业、工业和交通、粮食、文教卫生等系统的企、事业职工和训练班、中学学生共占全县总劳力的7.8％。为了充分发挥这些人的作用，更好地为农业生产服务，根据这些部门的不同特点，采取以下措施：
    第一，大搞技术革新和技术革命运动，提高劳动生产率，节约人力，满足新建企业需要，做到建厂不增人，增产又省人。根据初步查算，仅商业、工业和交通、粮食三个部门，就可从现有企、事业人员中抽出12.3％的人力，除去解决直接为农业服务的三个新建企业的用人外，还可抽调出一百六十多人投入农业生产。
    第二，改变商业、卫生等企、事业布局和管理制度。全县商业职工（不包括行政人员和所属工业职工）现在在大队工作的仅占商业职工的34.8％；全县卫生系统的企、事业人员在公社、大队的只占卫生系统企、事业人员的47％。深入到农村的企、事业人员不仅数量少，质量也差，和当前生产不相适应。根据这些情况，决定实行“三七制”，即把30％左右的商业和医务人员留在城镇，把70％左右的商业和医务人员搬到农村，要求他们做好三件事：一是把设在大队的分销店扩大为综合商店，做好生产、生活资料的供应和农副产品的收购工作；整顿和加强现有卫生所，设置简易病床。二是组织食堂炊事员或管理员代购代销，帮助食堂搞好服务部，便利群众购买零星日用品和出售零星副产品；大队卫生所除深入第一线巡回医疗外，还要帮助生产小队切实搞好食堂卫生，建立保健室。三是结合业务参加一定时间的农业生产，和社员同吃同住同劳动同商量。
    永宁县县级机关的干部和职工，经过学习，提高认识，纷纷写申请书、决心书，要求组织上批准下放到生产第一线，长期到农村安家落户，大办农业，大办粮食。已被批准下放的干部，有的已经走上新的工作岗位，投入农业生产。
