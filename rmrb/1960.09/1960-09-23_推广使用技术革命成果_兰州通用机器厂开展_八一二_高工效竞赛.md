Lanzhou, September 22nd (Report from this newspaper) The Lanzhou General Machinery Factory has launched an "August 12th" high-efficiency movement to complete twelve hours of work in eight hours, which has greatly promoted the in-depth development of the production increase and economy practice movement and the technological revolution movement. At present, the efficiency of 75% of the factory's machine tools and most of the workers has reached the "August 12th" target.

    The factory's "August 12th" competition movement started in June this year. The purpose of this movement is to enable employees to universally apply the achievements of the technological revolution in the first half of the year and improve work efficiency. In the "August 12th" competition, employees compete to see who adopts more new technologies in production, consolidates them well, and significantly improves work efficiency; and compete on who helps others master new technologies and promotes the communist style of great collaboration. Therefore, advanced experience is rapidly promoted, and the atmosphere of learning from, catching up with, and helping each other is greatly promoted throughout the factory, and new innovations are emerging one after another. The steelmaking workshop carried out technical transformation of the pig iron furnace and earnestly implemented advanced experiences such as strong wind and high temperature. In August, it had overfulfilled the annual steel output plan by 66%, and the qualification rate of steel reached 92%. Foundry worker Li Zhenhe's group adopted the advanced experience of "horizontal molding," shortening the time to complete the "jaw crusher" task from fifteen days to two days, and the entire group achieved "August 12th."

    In order to carry out the "August 12th" competition movement in depth and extensively, the factory party committee fully mobilized the masses to conduct a major inspection, major evaluation, major summary, major matching, major promotion, and major improvement of the achievements of the technological revolution, so that the consolidation and improvement of advanced experience and advanced technology became the conscious action of the masses. According to statistics from three metalworking and assembly workshops, since July, machine tools that frequently use more than three kinds of advanced experience have accounted for more than 70% of all machine tools, which has greatly improved work efficiency.

　　兰州通用机器厂开展“八一二”高工效竞赛
    本报兰州22日电　兰州通用机器厂开展八小时完成十二小时工作量的“八一二”高工效运动，大大促进了增产节约运动和技术革命运动的深入发展。现在，全厂75％的机床和大部分工人的工效已达到“八一二”指标。
    这个厂的“八一二”竞赛运动是从今年6月份开展的。这一运动的目的是为了使职工们普遍运用上半年技术革命的成果，提高工效。职工们在“八一二”竞赛运动中，赛谁在生产中采用的新技术多，巩固的好，提高工效显著；赛帮助别人掌握新技术和大协作的共产主义风格。因此使先进经验迅速推广，全厂学、赶、帮的风气大大发扬，新的革新事例层出不穷。炼钢车间把化铁炉进行了技术改造，认真贯彻大风、高温等先进经验，8月份已超额66％完成了全年钢产量计划，钢的合格率达到92％。铸工李振和小组采用了“卧地造型”的先进经验，把完成“颚式破碎机”的任务由十五天缩短到两天，全组都实现了“八一二”。
    为了深入广泛地开展“八一二”竞赛运动，工厂党委充分发动群众，对技术革命的成果进行大检查、大评比、大总结、大配套、大推广、大提高，使先进经验、先进技术的巩固和提高变为群众的自觉行动。据三个金工装配车间的统计，从7月份以来，经常使用三种以上先进经验的机床已占全部机床的70％以上，大大提高了工作效率。
