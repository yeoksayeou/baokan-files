The color documentary "Conquering the World's Highest Peak" is an outstanding film with great educational significance, a heroic poem. It profoundly and vividly reflects how, under the leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, and inspired by the General Line and the Great Leap Forward, our people possess the communist ambition, the courage to climb the world's highest peak despite its numerous natural barriers, and the ideology of strategically despising difficulties and tactically valuing difficulties. It possesses a high degree of ideological content and strong artistic appeal.

The film prominently reflects that this mountaineering activity was carried out under the leadership and care of the Party, and with the support and expectations of the people. From the moment the mountaineering team decided to climb Mount Everest, they received the care of central leaders, which gave them great encouragement. After the mountaineering team arrived in Tibet, the leaders of the Tibet Work Committee and the Preparatory Committee of the Tibet Autonomous Region gave multifaceted instructions and encouragement to the team's work. Many cities rushed to produce high-altitude food and equipment for the mountaineering team; scientific research departments sent excellent scientists to work with the mountaineers to fight for the summit of Mount Everest. A meteorological intelligence network was established from Beijing to Mount Everest to provide accurate weather forecasts for the mountaineers; the Tibetan people sent their outstanding sons and daughters to undertake the task of conquering Mount Everest together with their Han brothers; the Tibetan people along the way gazed at the departing mountaineers, expressing the people's earnest hope for the heroes to return victoriously; when the mountaineering heroes returned triumphantly, people from Lhasa to Beijing welcomed the heroes with great enthusiasm.

The vast majority of the film showcases the thrilling battle of our mountaineering heroes conquering Mount Everest. The mountaineers forgot their fatigue and disregarded the danger, trekking through the vast, perennial snow of the Himalayas and crossing the crisscrossing glacial terrain. The battle scene through the "North Col" area fully embodies the arduous and unyielding spirit of our mountaineers. Reconnaissance队员 used ice axes and their hands to carve out an "ice and snow highway" on the hard ice and snow for the team to pass through; on steep ice slopes with gradients of seventy or eighty degrees, four lives were linked together, crawling forward in groups; at high altitudes, oxygen was scarce, and they had to stop to gasp for breath after only a few steps; on this smooth and steep ice wall, ice storms and avalanches could occur at any time, and every step was fraught with the danger of losing their lives. However, the mountaineering heroes were full of courage, opening up the road to victory step by step, and finally conquered the "first difficult barrier" leading to the summit of Mount Everest. At an altitude of more than 7,000 meters, team leader Shi Zhanchun led his comrades on a third acclimatization march to find the road to the summit. A gale of more than twelve levels knocked him down, but the gale could not shake the strong will of a Communist Party member, he got up, stood firm, and continued to move forward. These thrilling battle scenes, and the heroes' indomitable and courageous fighting will, deeply gripped and excited people's hearts.

The film also fully embodies the revolutionary heroism and noble collectivist communist spirit of our mountaineers. Facing such an arduous battle, the young mountaineers were all vigorous and full of revolutionary optimism. Joyful handball games in the high mountains; singing a quick-rhythm song to wish their companions victory; looking out over the magnificent mountains and rivers of the motherland with joy in their hearts in the depths of the sea of clouds... the portrayal of each detail carves out the heroes' true colors of not fearing hardships and dangers. Conquering Mount Everest was a great victory of collectivism. For the honor of the collective and the honor of the motherland, the mountaineering heroes showed the noble qualities of selflessness, leaving the difficulties to themselves and giving the honor to others. Although the film failed to capture the deeds of Comrade Liu Lianman leaving his artificial oxygen to the comrades who were storming the main peak in the oxygen-deficient area of more than 8,700 meters, it did capture Liu Lianman Comrade stepping on the top of the "North Col" ice alley first, and although he was already exhausted, he insisted on hanging a rope ladder to meet and help the comrades who came up later; it captured the unsung heroes – the transport team members carrying heavy equipment and supplies, running back and forth on the dangerous ice slopes and steep rocks; it captured the meteorological staff and the telecommunications staff silently sticking to their posts, making their own contributions to the comrades who were storming the summit; it captured the doctors climbing to a height of more than 7,000 meters with the mountaineers, carefully examining the health of each member, and so on, which are very moving shots. All of this collectively reflects that everyone's hard work is for the lofty goal of conquering Mount Everest, and all of this vividly reflects the spiritual outlook of the great people of our great era.

The successful production of such an excellent documentary is itself a heroic achievement. The photographers and mountaineers together, in the midst of the cold and gales, on a difficult and arduous journey, sometimes had to rush ahead of the mountaineering team, and sometimes had to closely follow the departing team, they ran between the snow, ice slopes, and cliffs, capturing the scenes of battle, which is a rare and arduous struggle in the history of photography.

When the photographers climbed to a height of 7,600 meters, because their physiological conditions did not allow them to climb any further, the mountaineers took on the heavy task of filming. In the oxygen-deficient high mountains above 8,000 meters, they endured extreme fatigue, disregarding the rapid and pressing panting caused by lack of oxygen, and captured precious shots in the history of world cinema. Because the attack on the summit was carried out in the darkness of only starlight and snow light, the scene of the five-star red flag being hoisted on the "top of the earth" could not be captured, but when Qu Yinhua, who was already exhausted, returned to the 8,700-meter mark in the early morning, he still captured two rare and precious shots.

"Conquering the World's Highest Peak" also depicts the wonders of Mount Everest – azure blue ice towers, crystal-like ice pillars, strangely shaped "ice mushrooms," and clouds lingering around the summit... a dazzling array, which is fascinating. The bright colors, beautiful composition, moving music, and powerful commentary also each have their own characteristics, making the magnificent and majestic Mount Everest and the heroic achievements of mountaineering more gripping and vivid.

The screening of "Conquering the World's Highest Peak" once again encourages the vast number of people in our country to learn from the mountaineering heroes' ambition and scientific and realistic spirit, and to learn from the noble qualities they have shown for the Party, for the people, and for the revolutionary cause. It will further inspire the people of our country to unite, work hard, and strive to become stronger under the leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, never bowing their heads in the face of any difficulties, and to be indomitable and courageous in the struggle to transform the world and transform nature, determined to climb to all the highest peaks in various fields such as industry, agriculture, science, and culture!

    一首英雄诗
    荣高棠
    彩色纪录片《征服世界最高峰》是一部出色的、有着巨大教育意义的影片，是一首英雄诗。它深刻地、鲜明地反映了我国人民在党和毛主席的领导下，在总路线和大跃进的鼓舞下，具有共产主义的雄心壮志，敢于攀登这样一个重重天险的世界第一高峰和在战略上藐视困难、在战术上重视困难的思想。具有高度的思想性和强烈的艺术感染力。
    影片突出地反映了这次登山活动，是在党的领导和关怀下，是在人民的支援和期望中进行的。从登山队决定攀登珠穆朗玛峰起，就受到了中央领导同志的关怀，给了巨大的鼓舞。当登山队到达西藏以后，西藏工委和西藏自治区筹委会的领导同志，对登山队的工作作了多方面的指示和鼓励。许多城市为登山队赶制了高山食物和高山装备；科学研究部门派出了优秀的科学工作者协同登山队员们为夺取珠穆朗玛顶峰而战斗。从北京到珠穆朗玛峰，建立了气象情报网，为登山队员提供精确的气象预报；藏族人民派遣了优秀的儿女和汉族兄弟一起承担了征服珠穆朗玛峰的任务；沿途的藏族人民凝望着远去的登山队员们，表达了人民期望英雄们胜利归来的殷切心情；当登山英雄们凯旋归来时，从拉萨到北京，人们以巨大的热情欢迎了英雄们。
    影片的绝大篇幅，展现了我国登山英雄们征服珠穆朗玛峰的惊心动魄的战斗。登山队员们忘却疲累，不顾危险，跋涉在喜马拉雅山茫茫的万年积雪之中，跨过纵横的冰川地带。通过“北坳”地带的这一幕战斗情景，充分体现出了我国登山队员们坚苦卓绝的精神。侦察队员们用冰镐、用双手在坚硬的冰雪上刨出为大队通行的“冰雪公路”；在坡度达七、八十度的陡峭的冰坡上，四条生命连结在一起地一个个结组匍匐着前进；高山缺氧，走几步就得停下大口地喘气；在这光滑陡峭的冰壁上，随时都可能发生冰暴雪崩，每一步都埋伏着丧失生命的危险。但是，登山英雄们浑身是胆，一步一步开辟着胜利的道路，终于征服了通向珠穆朗玛顶峰的“第一道难关”。在七千多米的高山上，队长史占春带领了同志们作第三次适应性行军，以找出通向顶峰的道路。十二级以上的狂风把他刮倒了，但是狂风并不能动摇共产党员的坚强意志，爬起来，站稳了脚跟，再继续前进。这一幕幕惊心动魄的战斗情景，英雄们不屈不挠、勇往直前的战斗意志，深深地抓住和激动着人们的心。
    影片也充分体现了我国登山队员们的革命英雄主义和高贵的集体主义的共产主义风格。面对着这样一个艰巨的战斗，年青的登山队员们一个个生气勃勃，充满着革命的乐观主义精神。高山上欢乐的手球比赛；唱一曲快板预祝同伴的胜利；在云海深处心情畅快地了望祖国壮丽山河，……一个个细节的描绘，刻划出了英雄们不惧艰险的本色。征服珠穆朗玛峰，是一次集体主义的伟大胜利。登山英雄们为了集体的荣誉，为了祖国的荣誉，表现出了舍己为人，把困难留给自己，把荣誉让给别人的高贵品质。影片虽然未能摄下刘连满同志在八千七百多米的缺氧地带把人造氧气留给突上主峰的同志们的事迹，但拍下了刘连满同志第一个踏上了“北坳”冰胡同的顶端后，虽然已经精疲力尽，还坚持着挂起软梯，接应和帮助后上来的同志们；拍下了无名英雄们——运输队员们背负着沉重的装备和物资，来回奔波于艰险的冰坡和陡岩上；拍下了气象工作人员和报务人员默默地坚守着自己的岗位，为突击顶峰的同志们作出自己的贡献；拍下了医生随着登山队员登上七千多米的高度，细心诊视着每一位队员的健康等等十分感人的镜头。这一切集中地反映了每个人辛勤的劳动，都是为了征服珠穆朗玛峰这一崇高目的，这一切鲜明地反映了我们伟大时代伟大人民的精神面貌。
    拍制成功这样一部优秀的纪录片，本身也是一桩英雄的业绩。摄影工作者和登山队员们一起，在严寒和狂风的侵袭中，在艰难困苦的旅程中，有时要抢在登山队伍的前面，有时要紧紧追上远去的队伍，他们在积雪、冰坡、悬崖之间奔波，摄取战斗的情景，这在摄影史上是一场少有的艰苦的搏斗。
    当摄影师们攀登到七千六百米的高度，由于生理条件不允许他们再往上攀登以后，登山队员们就承担了拍摄工作的沉重任务。在八千米以上缺氧的高山上，他们忍受着极度的疲累，顾不得由于缺氧所引起的急促的、逼人的喘息，拍下了世界电影史上珍贵的镜头。由于突击顶峰时，是在只有星光和雪光的黑夜中，没有能够拍下五星红旗高插“地球之巅”的情景，但在清晨回到八千七百米的地方，已经疲乏不堪的屈银华，还拍下了两个稀世珍贵的镜头。
    《征服世界最高峰》，也给我们描绘了珠穆朗玛峰的奇景异色——蓝玉石般的冰塔，水晶般的冰柱，造型奇特的“冰蘑菇”，缭绕峰顶的烟云……琳琅满目，引人入胜。鲜艳的色彩，美妙的构图，动人的音乐，有力的解说词，也各有其特色，把雄伟壮丽的珠穆朗玛天险和登山的英雄业绩衬托得更加扣人心弦，有声有色。
    《征服世界最高峰》的上映，再一次鼓舞我国广大人民学习登山英雄们的雄心壮志和科学求实精神，学习他们为党、为人民、为革命事业所表现出来的高贵品质。它将进一步激励我国人民在党和毛主席的领导下，团结一致，艰苦奋斗，发愤图强，在任何困难面前不低头，在改造世界、改造自然的斗争中百折不挠，勇往直前，立志要登上工业、农业、科学文化等各个领域内的一切最高峰！（附图片）
