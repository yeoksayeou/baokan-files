To Prepare Fertilizer for Next Year's Early Rice Bumper Harvest
Changde County Adopts Various Methods to Expand Green Manure Planting

This newspaper Changsha, September 22nd dispatch: While focusing on the field management of current autumn harvest crops, Changde County in Hunan Province is fully mobilizing the masses to summarize and exchange experiences in planting green manure in previous years, adopting multiple planting, early planting, and intercropping methods to extensively plant green manure, laying a solid foundation for a greater summer grain harvest next year. Currently, the county has planted more than 165,000 mu of green manure.

Changde County achieved a bumper harvest of 750,000 mu of early rice this year. The main reasons, in addition to the strong leadership of the Party and the unparalleled superiority of the people's communes, are that this year's early rice fields had more fertilizer than in previous years, especially more green manure. Last year, the county planted 800,000 mu of green manure, with an average yield of about 8,000 jin per mu. In order to achieve an even greater harvest next year, the County Party Committee decided to continue expanding early rice planting next year. To realize this plan, the County Party Committee considered that the county's water sources and labor force were not major problems, but the most critical issue was fertilizer. Based on past experience, the best way to solve the problem of large-scale fertilizer is to plant more green manure. After repeated investigation and research, the County Party Committee decided to vigorously expand the planting of green manure throughout the county, striving to achieve one mu of green manure for every mu of farmland.

In order to effectively take concrete measures to ensure the green manure planting area, the Changde County Party Committee adopted multiple planting, early planting, and intercropping methods. In terms of multiple planting, the County Party Committee required that regardless of whether it is paddy or dry land, different varieties of green manure should be planted according to different conditions, to achieve "only seeing green, not yellow or white." Of the planned 1.45 million mu of green manure, it was decided to plant 800,000 mu of red flower grass seeds (i.e., purple cloud British), 200,000 mu of blue flower grass seeds (i.e., vetch), and 200,000 mu of substitute green manure (water celery, fleshy grass, water amaranth, etc.). In addition, all wasteland and gaps should be utilized as much as possible. In terms of early planting, according to the past experience of the masses, the characteristics of green manure are "likes warmth, tolerates cold, loves dryness, and fears waterlogging." Sowing in seasons with relatively high temperatures can promote the development of the root system, increase branching, and increase cold resistance. The County Party Committee required that the green manure in double-cropping rice fields must be sown no later than the "Autumn Equinox." In terms of intercropping, mixed planting, continuous planting, and interplanting, the county, in addition to the guaranteed harvest of broad beans, wheat, rapeseed, and other spring harvest crops and green manure seed retention fields, intercropped green manure in all the rest, such as intercropping green manure with large radishes, intercropping green manure in cotton fields in advance, and adopting mixed planting methods of red flower, blue flower, rapeseed, and full garden flowers. Mixed planting has many advantages, such as different green manures having different heights and times, which can make full use of land and space, eliminate sparse seedlings and missing seedlings, save seeds, expand area, adjust fertilizer, and resist cold in winter.

In order to realize the plan of large-scale expansion of green manure planting, Party committees at all levels have strengthened their leadership. County Party Secretary Lei Gongzheng personally took charge of this work, and each commune and brigade fixed a secretary to implement special leadership, grasping it from beginning to end. In this work, a "six guarantees" (seeds, area, quality, time, full seedlings, work points) system was established, with special personnel responsible to the end. At present, a movement of large-scale and special green manure planting has been launched throughout the county and has achieved good results.

### 为明年早稻丰产准备肥料　常德县采用多种办法扩种绿肥

　　为明年早稻丰产准备肥料
　　常德县采用多种办法扩种绿肥
    本报长沙22日电　湖南省常德县在抓好当前秋收作物田间管理的同时，充分发动群众总结交流往年种植绿肥的经验，采取多种、早种、间种等办法，大种绿肥，为明年多收夏粮打好基础。现在全县已种绿肥十六万五千多亩。
    常德县今年七十五万亩早稻获得丰收，主要原因除党的坚强领导和人民公社的无比优越性以外，就是今年的早稻田肥料比往年足，特别是绿肥下得多。去年全县种植的绿肥面积达八十万亩，平均亩产绿肥八千斤左右。为了夺取明年更大的丰收，县委决定明年继续扩种早稻。要实现这一计划，县委考虑到全县水源与劳力问题都不大，最关键性的问题是肥料。根据往年经验，要解决大面积的肥料问题，最好是多种绿肥。经过反复调查研究，县委决定在全县范围内大力扩种绿肥，争取做到一亩田地一亩绿肥。
    为了切实采取具体措施保证绿肥种植面积，中共常德县委采取了多种、早种和间种等办法。在多种方面，县委要求不论是水田旱地，根据不同条件种植不同品种的绿肥，做到“只见一片青，不见黄与白”。在规划的一百四十五万亩绿肥中，决定种红花草子（即紫云英）八十万亩，蓝花草子（即苕子）二十万亩，代用绿肥（水芹菜、肉草、水苋菜等）二十万亩。此外，所有的荒坪隙地尽量利用起来。在早种方面，根据广大群众往年的经验，绿肥的特性是“喜温暖，耐寒冷，爱干燥，怕渍涝”。在气温比较高的季节里播种，能促使根系发达，能增多分枝，增加抗寒力。县委要求做到双季稻田的绿肥最迟也不能迟过“秋分”播种。在间种、混种、连种、套种方面，全县除了保收的蚕豆、小麦、油菜等春收作物和绿肥留种田外，其余都间种绿肥，如绿肥与大萝卜间种，棉花地提前间种绿肥，以及采用红花、蓝花、油菜、满园花混种办法。混种好处很多，如各种绿肥高矮迟早不一，可充分利用土地、空间，消灭苗稀苗缺现象，还能节约用种，扩大面积，调整肥分，冬天能抗寒等。
    为了实现大面积扩种绿肥的规划，各级党委都加强了领导。县委书记雷恭政亲自抓这一工作，各公社、大队都固定一个书记实行专人领导，一抓到底。在这项工作中并建立了“六包”（种子、面积、质量、时间、全苗、工分）制度，专人负责到底。目前，一个大种特种绿肥的运动已在全县展开并已收到良好的效果。
