Xinhua News Agency, Changsha, September 20th: Under the unified leadership of the Changning County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, Songbai Iron Factory in Changning County, Hunan Province, and units such as Dayishan Iron Ore Mine, Shangyou Coal Mine, Yumin Coal Mine, Hongqi Coke Plant, and the Shuikoushan Transportation Team are cooperating with each other, taking steel as the key link, to ensure the continuous improvement of the output and quality of raw coal, coke, ore, and pig iron.

Songbai Iron Factory, Dayishan Iron Ore Mine, Shangyou Coal Mine, Yumin Coal Mine, and Hongqi Coke Plant were all established during the Great Leap Forward for steel production in 1958. From the very beginning of their production, they established corresponding cooperative relationships. Now, Changning Songbai Iron Factory has become a national red banner for high-quality and high-yield small blast furnaces. Dayishan Iron Ore Mine, Shangyou Coal Mine, Yumin Coal Mine, and Hongqi Coke Plant have also become advanced production units in the special zone and county.

In order to grasp the important links of coal, iron, mining, and transportation, and further strengthen cooperation between factories and mines, the Changning County Party Committee, in addition to the secretary in charge of industry frequently going to the iron factory to work and direct the overall situation, also transferred three county committee members to the front line of coal, mining, and transportation production to strengthen leadership. The Party committees of each factory and mine, in accordance with the deployment of the county party committee, took the initiative to adopt measures to increase production and tried their best to create convenient conditions for each other. The Party Committee of Dayishan Iron Ore Mine often took the initiative to send people to the iron factory to solicit opinions and arrange the production plan of the mine according to the production and storage needs of the iron factory at various times. For example, in August, Xiong Zhenshan, the secretary of the mine's Party Committee, went to the iron factory to hold a cooperation meeting and learned that the iron factory's newly built 55.5 cubic meter blast furnace would be put into production ahead of schedule in September. After returning to the mine, he and all the cadres went to the front line of production. Focusing on the current weak link in production—mining work—they accelerated the technological transformation of the mine and vigorously promoted advanced experience in mining and ore dressing. Due to the adoption of many measures, the grade of ore supplied by this mine to Songbai Iron Factory has increased from the original 40% to about 56% now, providing a prerequisite for high-quality and high-yield iron production.

All the workers of Shangyou Coal Mine, Yumin Coal Mine, and Hongqi Coke Plant also put forward the slogan of "Mining more coal, mining good coal, coking more, and coking good," to ensure the supply of fuel needed by the iron factory. Teng Chujia, the secretary of the Coke Plant's Party Committee, and Zhang Guangqian, a leading cadre of the coal mine, went to various important work sections such as coal mining, coal washing, coal blending, and coking to participate in production and solve problems. Zhang Guangqian discovered in the first coal mine that the narrow and curved coal mine tunnels were an obstacle to increasing production. He consulted with the underground workers and changed the curved shaft to a straight shaft, changed the narrow lane to a wide lane, and changed the single-track coal transport to a double-track coal transport, quickly increasing the daily output of raw coal from the original 30 tons to 150 tons. The Hongqi Coking Plant took a series of measures to improve the quality and coking rate of coke compared to before. Now, the ash content of the coke produced by this factory has been reduced to below 10%, and the sulfur content has been reduced to less than 1%.

In addition to rationally arranging the original vehicles and ships for transportation according to the increase in raw materials and fuel and further tapping transportation potential, the workers of the Shuikoushan Transportation Team also cooperated with other units to build light railways, repair highways, and dredge rivers, connecting the 120-plus-mile mountain roads, land, and water transportation lines between factories and mines into an unobstructed transportation line. In addition, by improving loading and unloading tools, they broke through the weak link of three-time transshipment of mountains, land, and water, accelerated the turnaround time of vehicles and ships, increased the transportation volume by twice as much as before, and timely guaranteed the supply of raw materials and fuel for the iron factory, and also saved more than 900 transportation laborers.

With the support of the mining, coal, coke, and transportation departments, the workers of the iron factory further launched a campaign to increase production and practice economy. According to statistics for the first six days of September, the average daily output of pig iron increased by more than one time compared to August, the pass rate of pig iron reached 90.5%, and the sulfur content of iron has recently been reduced to 0.15%. While substantially increasing production, the consumption of raw materials and fuel has also been reduced.

### 松柏铁厂同铁矿、煤矿、焦厂、运输队互相协作  以铁厂为中心大搞煤铁矿运

    松柏铁厂同铁矿、煤矿、焦厂、运输队互相协作
    以铁厂为中心大搞煤铁矿运
    据新华社长沙20日电　湖南省常宁县松柏铁厂和大义山铁矿、上游煤矿、裕民煤矿、红旗焦厂以及水口山运输专业队等单位，在中共常宁县委统一领导下，以钢为纲，互相协作，保证了原煤、焦炭、矿石和生铁的产量质量不断提高。
    松柏铁厂和大义山铁矿、上游煤矿、裕民煤矿、红旗焦厂都是1958年大办钢铁的时候建立起来的。它们一开始投入生产，就建立了对口挂钩的关系。现在，常宁松柏铁厂已经成为全国小高炉优质高产的红旗。大义山铁矿和上游煤矿、裕民煤矿、红旗焦厂也成了专区和县的先进生产单位。
    为了抓好煤、铁、矿、运这几个重要环节，进一步加强厂矿之间的协作，中共常宁县委除管工业的书记经常深入铁厂工作指挥全面外，并抽调三个县委委员分驻煤、矿、运生产第一线，加强领导。各厂矿党委按照县委的部署，都主动地采取了增产措施，尽力为对方创造便利条件。大义山铁矿党委经常主动派人到铁厂征求意见，按照铁厂各个时期生产和储备的需要，安排矿山的生产计划。比如8月间矿山党委书记熊振山到铁厂开协作会，知道铁厂新建的五十五点五立方米高炉要提前在9月份投入生产。他回到矿山以后，就和全体干部深入生产第一线，针对当前生产中的薄弱环节——采掘工作，加速矿山技术改造，同时大力推广采矿和选矿方面的先进经验。由于采取了许多措施，这个矿供应松柏铁厂的矿石品位，由原来的40％提高到现在的56％左右，为铁厂优质高产提供了先决条件。
    上游煤矿、裕民煤矿和红旗焦厂的全体职工也提出“多采煤、采好煤、多炼焦、炼好焦”的行动口号，保证铁厂所需燃料的供应。焦厂党委书记滕楚家和煤矿领导干部张光前等，分别深入到挖煤、洗煤、配煤和炼焦等各个紧要工段，参加生产，解决问题。张光前在第一煤井中发现煤井窿道狭小、弯曲，是提高产量的障碍，就同井下工人商量，把弯井改为直井，把窄道改成宽道，把单车道拖煤改为双车道拖煤，很快使原煤日产量由原来三十吨提高到一百五十吨。红旗炼焦厂采取了一系列的措施，使焦炭的质量、成焦率都比以前上升。现在这个厂炼出的焦炭灰份已降低到10％以下，含硫量已少于1％。
    水口山运输专业队的工人除把原有车船运输工具，根据原料燃料增长情况进行合理安排，进一步挖掘运输潜力以外，还同别的单位协作修建轻便轨道，修补公路，疏通河道，使厂矿之间一百二十多里的山道、陆地、水上运输联成一条畅通无阻的运输线。另外还通过改进装卸工具，攻破了山、陆、水三次转运的薄弱环节，加速了车船运转时间，使运量比原来增加两倍，及时保证了铁厂原料和燃料的供应，而且节省了九百多个运输劳力。
    铁厂工人在矿、煤、焦、运这几个部门的支援下，进一步掀起了增产节约竞赛。据9月份前六天统计，生铁平均日产量比8月份提高一倍多，生铁合格率达到90.5％，铁的含硫量最近已降低到0.15％。在大幅度增产的同时，还降低了原料和燃料的消耗。
