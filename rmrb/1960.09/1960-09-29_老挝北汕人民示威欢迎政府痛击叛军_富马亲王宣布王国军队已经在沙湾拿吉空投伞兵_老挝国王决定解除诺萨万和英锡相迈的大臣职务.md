Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 28th -- According to a broadcast from Vientiane Radio cited by the Vietnam News Agency today, in North Xien, northeast of Vientiane, the capital of Laos, more than 7,000 people held demonstrations on September 23 to welcome the victory won by the Second Parachute Battalion led by Captain Kong Le in defending Vientiane, fighting the Phoumi Nosavan-Boun Oum Na Champassak rebel group, and recovering North Xien.

The demonstrators expressed their firm support for the coup committee headed by Captain Kong Le and the Souvanna Phouma government, and their cooperation with them to defeat the Phoumi Nosavan-Boun Oum Na Champassak group.

Vientiane Radio also broadcast a letter signed by soldiers, police, staff, and workers from all walks of life in Vientiane, which has been submitted to the Prime Minister of the Kingdom of Laos. The letter expressed support for the government's policy of peace, neutrality, and national harmony.

Representatives from all walks of life in Vientiane also wrote a letter to the people of Lower Laos, exposing the deceptive propaganda of the Phoumi Nosavan-Boun Oum Na Champassak group regarding the so-called occupation of Vientiane by foreign troops, the difficult life in Vientiane, and the lack of freedom, etc.

The letter condemned the cruel suppression of the people by the Phoumi Nosavan-Boun Oum Na Champassak group in Lower Laos. The letter expressed the firm belief that the people of Savannakhet, Pakse, and Attopeu Provinces, with their indomitable fighting spirit, will eliminate the Phoumi Nosavan-Boun Oum Na Champassak group.

Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 28th -- Vientiane News: According to Agence France-Presse, Lao Prime Minister Prince Phouma announced at a press conference on the 27th that the Lao Royal Army had parachuted paratroopers into Savannakhet, and the military position of Phoumi Nosavan was collapsing on all fronts. It is reported that the highways from Savannakhet south to Pakse and north to Thakhek have been cut off.

Phouma said that the purpose of these paratroopers was to contact Nosavan's troops and villagers in the Savannakhet area in order to win them over to his side.

Another report said that the Royal Army also attacked the Phoumi Nosavan rebels in Ban Phone and North Kladone village south of North Xien, and the rebels retreated further south.

According to Vientiane Radio today, the Nam Ngum bridge on the Vientiane-North Xien highway was destroyed by artillery shells from Thailand in the early morning of the 26th.

Prime Minister Phouma told reporters about this incident that he would protest to the Thai authorities against this renewed interference in Laos. He said that he did not know for sure whether the aforementioned shells were fired by the Thai army or by Phoumi Nosavan's troops in Thailand, but in any case, the facts have proved that Thailand is interfering in Laos.

Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 28th -- According to Vientiane Radio yesterday, the King of Laos signed Decree No. 231 on September 21, deciding to remove Phoumi Nosavan and Leuam Insisiengmay from their ministerial posts in the Lao Royal Government from the date of the decree's promulgation.

Phoumi Nosavan and Leuam Insisiengmay originally served as Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Economy respectively in the Phouma government. However, they not only refused to return to Vientiane to take office, but also established a so-called "Anti-Coup Committee" in Savannakhet and a "Revolutionary Committee" headed by Boun Oum Na Champassak to oppose the Phouma government and the coup committee led by Captain Kong Le. They also publicly declared that they would revise the Kingdom's Constitution, oppose the King, and oppose the Phouma government's policy of peace, neutrality, and national harmony.

　　富马亲王宣布王国军队已经在沙湾拿吉空投伞兵
　　老挝国王决定解除诺萨万和英锡相迈的大臣职务
    新华社河内28日电　据越南通讯社今天援引万象电台广播，在老挝首都万象东北的北汕，有七千多人在9月23日举行示威游行，欢迎由贡勒大尉领导的第二伞兵营在保卫万象、打击富米·诺萨万—文翁·纳占巴塞叛乱集团并收复北汕的战斗中所获得的胜利。
    示威群众表示他们坚决支持以贡勒大尉为首的政变委员会和梭发那·富马政府，并同它们合作，来击溃富米·诺萨万—文翁·纳占巴塞集团。
    万象电台还广播，有军人、警察、职员和工人签名的万象各阶层人民所写的一封信，已经送交老挝王国政府首相，信中表示支持政府采取和平、中立和民族和睦政策。
    万象各阶层人民的代表们还写信给下寮人民，揭露富米·诺萨万—文翁·纳占巴塞集团关于所谓外国军队占领万象、万象生活困苦和缺乏自由等等欺骗宣传。
    信中谴责富米·诺萨万—文翁·纳占巴塞集团在下寮对人民所进行的残酷镇压。信中表示深信：沙湾拿吉、巴色和阿速坡省的人民，凭着自己的不屈不挠的斗争精神，将会消灭富米·诺萨万—文翁·纳占巴塞集团。
    新华社河内28日电　万象消息：据法新社报道，老挝首相富马亲王27日在记者招待会上宣布，老挝王国军队已在沙湾拿吉空投伞兵，富米·诺萨万的军事地位在所有的战线上都在崩溃。有消息说，从沙湾拿吉往南到巴色和往北到泰克的公路已被切断。
    富马说，这些伞兵的目的是要同沙湾拿吉地区的诺萨万的部队和乡村居民接触，以便把他们争取到他这边来。
    另有消息说，王国军队又在北汕以南的挽丰和北克拉敦村袭击了富米·诺萨万叛军，叛军进一步往南溃退。
    另据万象电台今天广播说：万象—北汕公路上的南罗桥26日凌晨曾被来自泰国的炮弹击毁。
    富马首相就这件事向记者说，他将向泰国当局抗议这种再次干涉老挝的行为。他说，他还没有明确知道上述炮弹是泰国军队或者是在泰国的富米·诺萨万军队发射的，但无论如何，事实都已证明泰国正在干涉老挝。
    新华社河内28日电　据万象电台昨天广播，老挝国王已在9月21日签署了第二三一号诏命，决定从诏命发布之日起解除富米·诺萨万和仑·英锡相迈等两人在老挝王国政府中的大臣职务。
  富米·诺萨万和仑·英锡相迈原来在富马政府内分别担任副首相和经济大臣。但是，他们不仅拒绝回到万象就职，而且还在沙湾拿吉建立了一个所谓的“反政变委员会”和一个以文翁·纳占巴塞为首的“革命委员会”，来反对富马政府和由贡勒大尉领导的政变委员会。他们还公开宣称要修改王国宪法、反对国王和反对富马政府的和平中立、民族和睦政策。
