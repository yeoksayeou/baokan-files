    New House Building Machine is Highly Efficient: Eight People Can Build a Five-Story Building
    In Soviet construction projects, the level of mechanized construction is getting higher and higher. Recently, Soviet engineers Popov and Charkovich designed a new type of house building machine. This machine is like a gantry crane, with a studio on top. Workers sit in the studio, issue commands, and the lifting and transporting machinery accurately transports various building materials to their proper positions, truly "each in its place," without the slightest error. In this way, there is no need for auxiliary workers during construction. Building a five-story building requires only eight workers, five of whom operate the machine, and the other three are assemblers.

    新式房屋建筑机效率高  只用八人盖起五层大楼
    在苏联的建筑工程中，机械化施工的水平越来越高。最近苏联工程师波波夫和查尔柯维奇又设计了一种新式的房屋建筑机。这部机器像门形起重机，上面有工作室。工人坐在工作室内，发号施令，起重和运输机械就把各种建筑材料准确地运送到它们应占的位置，真是
  “各就各位”，分毫不差。这样，建筑时就不需要辅助工人。建筑一座五层楼房只需要八个工人，其中五个人开机器，另外三个是装配工。
