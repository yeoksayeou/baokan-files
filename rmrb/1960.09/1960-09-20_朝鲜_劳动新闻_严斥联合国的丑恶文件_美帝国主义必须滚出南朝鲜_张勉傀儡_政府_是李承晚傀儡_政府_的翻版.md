Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, September 18th: The North Korean "Rodong Sinmun" today published an article entitled "An Ugly and Deceptive Document," strongly condemning and refuting the tenth "annual report" that the so-called "United Nations Commission for the Unification and Rehabilitation of Korea" is about to submit to the Fifteenth Session of the United Nations General Assembly.

The article said that, as is well known, the so-called "United Nations Commission for the Unification and Rehabilitation of Korea" is a tool of aggression against Korea created by American imperialism ten years ago by starting its voting machine in the United Nations General Assembly.

The "annual report" produced this time, like the previous ones, in order to cover up the U.S. policy of dividing Korea, nonsensically claims that the "prospects for unification are remote," and shifts the responsibility to the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.

The article said that the so-called "elections under the supervision of the United Nations," which American imperialism keeps clamoring for, are nothing more than a trick to permanently divide Korea and turn the entire Korean peninsula into a colony. The article said that in past General Assembly discussions on the Korean issue, American imperialism has rudely trampled on the United Nations Charter, and used the "annual report" of the so-called "United Nations Commission for the Unification and Rehabilitation of Korea" to pass unilateral resolutions that run counter to the interests of the Korean people without the participation of representatives of the Korean people. This time, too, it is attempting to realize its aggressive ambition to continue to occupy South Korea and obstruct the peaceful reunification of Korea.

The article pointed out that today's Chang Myon puppet "government" is a carbon copy of the Syngman Rhee puppet "government" manufactured by American imperialism, which is a well-known fact. However, the "report" of the "United Nations Commission for the Unification and Rehabilitation of Korea" describes the current situation in South Korea—which preserves the colonial fascist terror regime and Syngman Rhee's fascist laws intact, stifles democratic political parties and social organizations, and suppresses the patriotic movement of the people striving for the right to survival and freedom—as "the development of righteous politics" and "democratic growth." This is an intolerable insult and mockery of the South Korean people who are struggling against the puppet reactionary rule.

The article said that the "Commission's" clumsy conspiracy is even more exposed in the "economic situation and prospects" section of its "report." They say that in order to maintain the stability of the South Korean economy, "foreign aid" through "individual countries" or "international organizations" is needed, and nonsensically claim that only by "mainly relying on foreign aid provided by the United States" can "the necessary living standards and administrative levels be maintained." The article asked, how could anyone dare to say such a thing unless they were a pawn of American monopoly capital? Isn't the tragic reality of South Korea today precisely the vicious result of predatory American "aid"?

The article said that the "United Nations Commission for the Unification and Rehabilitation of Korea" desperately clamors for the need for foreign capital, which can only show that, as an instrument of American imperialism, it regards serving the colonial enslavement policy of American imperialism in South Korea as its sole task.

The article said that the Korean people resolutely condemn the dirty document manufactured by the "United Nations Commission for the Unification and Rehabilitation of Korea"—the so-called "annual report"—which insults the Korean people and tramples on human conscience. The Korean people will never tolerate the existence of the American imperialist tool—the so-called "United Nations Commission for the Unification and Rehabilitation of Korea"—and resolutely demand its immediate dissolution.

The article concluded by saying that the only way to clean up the current dilapidated situation in South Korea and save the South Korean economy and people's lives, as Comrade Kim Il-sung said at the celebration of the fifteenth anniversary of the liberation of Korea on "August 15," is to withdraw American troops, realize mutual economic and cultural exchange between the North and South, and peacefully reunify the motherland by the Koreans themselves without any foreign interference. The mortal enemy of the Korean people—American imperialism—should immediately get out together with the lackeys of the "United Nations Commission for the Unification and Rehabilitation of Korea" who have been illegally dragged into South Korea!

    朝鲜“劳动新闻”严斥联合国的丑恶文件
    美帝国主义必须滚出南朝鲜
    张勉傀儡“政府”是李承晚傀儡“政府”的翻版
    据新华社平壤18日电　朝鲜“劳动新闻”今天以“丑恶的骗人的文件”为题发表文章，强烈谴责和驳斥所谓“联合国韩国统一复兴委员会”将要提交给联合国大会第十五届会议的第十次“年度报告”。
    文章说，如所周知，所谓“联合国韩国统一复兴委员会”是十年前美帝国主义在联合国大会开动它的表决机器所制造出来的侵略朝鲜的工具。
    这次制造的“年度报告”也和从前一样，为了掩盖美国对朝鲜的分裂政策，胡说什么“统一展望是遥远的”，并把责任推到朝鲜民主主义人民共和国方面。
    文章说，美帝国主义一味叫嚷的所谓“在联合国监督下的选举”，只不过是永远分裂朝鲜，使全朝鲜变成殖民地的阴谋的把戏。文章说，美帝国主义在历届联大讨论朝鲜问题时粗暴地蹂躏联合国宪章，利用所谓“联合国韩国统一复兴委员会”的“年度报告”在没有朝鲜人民的代表参加的情况下通过了同朝鲜人民的利益背道而驰的片面的决议。这次也是企图这样来实现它继续强占南朝鲜、阻挠和平统一朝鲜的侵略野心。
    文章指出，今天的张勉傀儡“政府”就是美帝国主义制造的李承晚傀儡“政府”的翻版，这是人所共知的事实。但是“联合国韩国统一复兴委员会”的“报告”却把原封不动地保存殖民地法西斯恐怖统治机构和李承晚的法西斯法令、扼杀民主政党和社会团体、镇压人民争取生存权利和自由的爱国运动的南朝鲜现状，说成是“大义政治的发展”和“民主成长”。这是对为反傀儡反动统治而进行斗争的南朝鲜人民的不可容忍的侮辱和愚弄。
    文章说，这个“委员会”的拙劣的阴谋，在它的“报告”里叙述的南朝鲜的“经济情况和展望”一部分中更加暴露无遗。他们说，为了维持南朝鲜经济的安定，需要通过“个别国家”或“国际组织”的“外国援助”，并胡说什么只有“主要依靠美国提供的外国援助”，“才能维持必要的生活水平和行政水平。”文章问道，不是美国垄断资本的走卒，怎能敢说这样的话呢？南朝鲜今天这样的悲惨现实，岂不正是掠夺性的美国“援助”的恶毒的后果吗？
    文章说，“联合国韩国统一复兴委员会”拼命叫嚷必须用外国资本，这只能说明他们作为美帝国主义的侵略工具，把为美帝国主义对南朝鲜的殖民奴役政策服务当作他们唯一的任务。
    文章说，朝鲜人民坚决谴责“联合国韩国统一复兴委员会”制造出来的侮辱朝鲜人民、蹂躏人类良心的肮脏的文件——所谓“年度报告”。朝鲜人民决不容忍美帝国主义的侵略工具——所谓“联合国韩国统一复兴委员会”的存在，并且坚决要求它立即解散。
    文章最后说，收拾南朝鲜目前的残破局势，并拯救南朝鲜经济和人民生活的唯一道路，正如金日成同志在“八·一五”朝鲜解放十五周年的庆祝大会上说的一样：在于撤出美国军队，实现南北互相经济和文化交流，在没有任何外国人干涉的情况下由朝鲜人自己和平统一祖国。朝鲜人民的死敌——美帝国主义应同非法拉进南朝鲜的“联合国韩国统一复兴委员会”的奴才们一道立即滚出去！
