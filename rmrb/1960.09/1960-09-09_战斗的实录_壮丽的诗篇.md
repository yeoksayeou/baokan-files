    A Record of Battle, A Magnificent Epic
    Ma Tieding
    "Conquering the World's Highest Peak," I've watched it more than once, and every time I watch it, I can't suppress the excitement and agitation in my heart.
    Is Mount Everest high? Need you even ask, it's the world's highest peak. And it is this highest peak that is now under the feet of our heroic mountaineers.
    The world's photography industry may be able to shoot ten, a hundred, a thousand, ten thousand films more thrilling than "Conquering the World's Highest Peak," but these thrillers are either completely fake, or more or less contain elements of falsehood. Only "Conquering the World's Highest Peak" is both a record of battle and a magnificent epic!
    At an altitude of 8,700 meters, two shots were taken—a sea of clouds and snow-covered peaks. These two shots have written a glorious page in the history of world photography, and now and in the future, millions upon millions of viewers will draw endless spiritual strength from this page! When I saw these two shots on the screen, my heart suddenly sank due to excessive excitement, and I silently paid high tribute to our heroes!
    There is a folk song:
    "If the sky has a handle, we can lift it,
    If the earth has a ring, we can raise it.
    Whatever Chairman Mao asks us to do,
    Can you find one that doesn't end in victory?"
    Revolutionary bold words are substantiated by revolutionary drive and revolutionary practice. Chairman Mao asked us to plant the five-star red flag on the world's highest peak, and our heroic mountaineers answered loudly: We guarantee to Chairman Mao that we will plant it there.
    "He who walks a hundred li considers ninety as half the journey," when walking a long distance, the closer you get to the end, the more difficult it becomes; the same is true for mountaineering, the closer you get to the summit, the more physical exertion is required for each step, and the more it requires a strong will, unparalleled perseverance, and indomitable fighting spirit to support it.
    "The weather changed, and the temperature dropped sharply to about minus thirty-seven degrees Celsius. The twelve-force gale was whipping our bodies, and our faces were stung by the wind as if pricked by needles. Whenever the wind weakened slightly, without anyone saying a word, everyone would move forward in unison." ("Recording Heroic Achievements on the World's Highest Peak")
    This is not just about heroic mountaineers, isn't it also a vivid image of our entire country? A strong will, unparalleled perseverance, and indomitable fighting spirit, aren't these just qualities of heroic mountaineers, aren't they also qualities of the class, the nation, and the great Chinese people?
    We must build our motherland into a strong socialist country with modern industry, modern agriculture, and modern science and culture at the fastest speed, just like scaling Mount Everest, even if we encounter all kinds of difficulties, obstacles, and setbacks along the way, we must and can reach the summit!
    We are the "foolish old man" of the new era, let those "wise old men" stand aside and sneer. He who laughs last laughs best. The Chinese people have a bit of toughness and backbone in their great humility: to those who oppose us, those who sneer at us, we will give them a taste of our power. If you don't believe it, there are the examples of the heroic mountaineers!
    The heroic mountaineers have not only climbed the highest peak in nature, but have also created invaluable peaks in the realm of thought and spirit. However, peaks can never be fully climbed: beyond the earth, there are countless planets; the spiritual realm of communism is also a series of peaks and valleys, and after climbing one peak, there are even higher peaks ahead. The achievements we have made are, for revolutionaries, nothing more than encouragement and impetus to continue moving forward. Along the long river of conquering nature and transforming society, let us cut through thorns and forge ahead bravely!

    战斗的实录　壮丽的诗篇
    马铁丁
    《征服世界最高峰》，看过不止一次，每看一次，都压抑不住心头的兴奋和激动。
    珠穆朗玛峰高不高呢？那还用说，世界第一高峰。就是这个第一高峰，踩在我们登山英雄们的脚下。
    世界摄影界也许可以摄十部、百部、千部、万部比《征服世界最高峰》还要惊险得多的影片，可是，这些惊险片或者完完全全是虚假的，或者多多少少带有虚假的成分。唯有这《征服世界最高峰》，既是战斗的实录，又是壮丽的诗篇！
    在海拔八千七百米处，摄下了两个镜头——云海和复着白雪的山峰。这两个镜头在世界摄影史上写下开天辟地的光辉的一页，现在与未来，千千万万观众，都会从这一页中吸取无穷的精神力量！当我在银幕上看到这两个镜头的时候，我的心由于过度兴奋而突然沉下来，默默中向我们的英雄们致以崇高的敬意！
    有一首民歌：
    “天有把，我们举得起，
    地有环，我们提得起。
    毛主席叫我们做的事体，
    你看哪项不胜利？”
    革命的豪言壮语，是以革命的干劲，革命的实践作为佐证的。毛主席要我们把五星红旗插到世界顶峰去，我们的登山英雄们响亮地回答：向毛主席保证，我们一定插上去。
    “行百里者半九十”，长途走路，越到接近终点的时候越艰难；登山更是这样，越接近顶峰，每走一步，都要付出很大的体力消耗，都需要坚强的意志，无比的毅力，百折不挠的韧性战斗来支持。
    “天气变了，气温急骤下降到零下三十七度左右。十二级的大风掀动着身躯，脸上被风吹得像针扎一般。每当风势稍弱时，不用谁打招呼，大家就不约而同地向前移动。”（《在世界最高峰上纪录下英雄业绩》）
    这岂止是登山英雄们，难道不也是我们整个国家的生动形象吗？坚强的意志，无比的毅力，百折不挠的韧性战斗精神，又岂止是属于登山英雄们的，难道不也是属于阶级的、民族的、伟大的中国人民的吗？
    我们要用最快的速度把祖国建成有现代工业、现代农业、现代科学文化的社会主义强国，正像高登珠穆朗玛峰一样，即使旅途中会遇到种种困难、险阻、挫折，但是，顶峰一定要登上去，也是能够登上去的！
    我们是新时代的“愚公”，让那些“智叟”们站在一旁讪笑吧。谁笑得最后，谁笑得最好。中国人民在高度的谦逊中就有那么一点硬劲和骨气：对反对我们的人，讪笑我们的人，偏要给点颜色他们看看。不信的话，有登山英雄们的榜样在！
    登山英雄们不仅是攀登上自然界的最高峰，而且在思想领域、精神境界上创造了难能可贵的高峰。但是，高峰是攀登不完的：地球之外，还有无数星球；共产主义的精神境界也是峰峦起伏，爬上一个高峰，还有更高的高峰在前面。我们所获得的成就，对革命者来说，无非是继续前进的鼓励和鞭策。沿着征服自然、改造社会的时代长河，披荆斩棘，奋勇直前吧！
