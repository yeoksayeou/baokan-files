    Expand Planting Area, Make Good Preparations, Guarantee Planting and Good Growing:
    Eight Southern Provinces and Regions Warmly Welcome the Winter Planting High Tide
    Guangdong: Treat Winter Planting as a Season of Production
    (Our newspaper, Guangzhou, 24th) While vigorously carrying out field management of late rice, all parts of Guangdong Province have generally started land planning for winter planting, arranging crop rotations, and preparing fertilizers, seeds, farm tools, and other items. All localities are determined to treat winter planting as a season of production.
    Guangdong Province plans to plant a larger area this winter than in any previous year with the highest winter planting area in history. It is determined to focus on planting grain, while also planting vegetables and green manure extensively, and actively expanding the planting of other winter-suitable cash crops. To ensure planting and good growing, all localities have made preparations for winter planting early and implemented tasks and measures in contracted units. In Puning County, each commune and brigade held forums for experienced farmers, meetings for technicians, and general meetings for commune members in August. By mobilizing the masses to carefully calculate, check the land, they found 240,000 mu of land that could be used to expand winter planting. To improve land utilization and maximize the winter planting area, all parts of the province have decided to vigorously promote intercropping and interplanting of winter crops.
    While carrying out land planning and arranging crop rotations, all localities are also focusing on the preparation of seeds, fertilizers, and farm tools. In Huazhou County, a winter seed survey team was organized at the end of August to conduct a thorough inventory of seed reserves in various warehouses, and more than 1.3 million jin of winter rice, barley, wheat, soybeans, black beans, corn, millet, and other seeds were tested and identified. According to the requirements of expanding the winter planting area this year, each commune in Dianbai County also cultivated more than 27,000 mu of high-quality sweet potato seedlings early and mobilized the masses to raise more than 118,000 jin of other winter planting seeds. Local agricultural machinery departments are also rushing to manufacture and repair plows, harrows, hoes, and various small farm tools to meet the needs of large-scale winter cultivation.
    Guangxi: Winter Planting Area Exceeds Any Previous Year
    (Our newspaper, Nanning, 24th) While strengthening the late-stage field management of autumn harvest crops, all parts of Guangxi are stepping up preparations for winter planting.
    This year, all localities in the autonomous region are doing everything possible to expand the winter planting area and treat it as a season of grain production, striving to harvest one more season and change from two crops a year to three crops a year. Guilin Prefecture, which has a winter planting tradition, will expand by 40% compared to last year; Yulin Prefecture, which has rarely engaged in winter planting, plans to plant an area accounting for 82% of the total paddy field area. The planned winter planting area for the entire autonomous region this year exceeds any previous year. Among them, grain crops are the main focus, as well as green manure and cash crops.
    Early preparation to promote good results early is a characteristic of this year's winter planting preparation work. As early as May 14, the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region Committee of the Communist Party of China approved the experience of three crops a year in Bobai County and called on all localities to vigorously promote three crops a year according to local conditions. Subsequently, all localities successively formulated winter planting plans, implemented them from top to bottom, and actively carried out various ideological and material preparations.
    Completing this year's huge winter planting plan, seed preparation is an arduous task. In addition to adopting methods such as self-propagation, self-selection, self-retention, self-use, and mutual adjustment to solve the problem, relevant departments in the autonomous region have also transferred a large number of seeds from outside the province to subsidize areas lacking seeds. At present, seeds for winter grain crops such as barley, wheat, buckwheat, broad beans, peas, and winter sweet potatoes have been basically prepared, and seeds for winter tobacco, green manure, and other crops have also been partially prepared.
    At present, all localities are further checking the preparation work for winter planting and vigorously developing fertilizer and tools for winter planting. From late August to September 20, Jingxi County has accumulated 5.45 million dan of various fertilizers. In order to reduce the labor force for transporting fertilizer, Ande Commune has established many fertilizer stations in the fields to store fertilizer locally.
    Fujian: Vigorously Grasp the Reform, Repair, and Manufacture of Old and New Tools for Winter Planting
    (Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou, 24th) People's communes in various parts of Fujian Province are launching early preparations for autumn harvesting and winter cultivation and planting. Up to now, nearly half of the counties and communes in the province have basically prepared their autumn harvesting and winter planting tools. Other counties and communes have also mobilized the masses to discuss and revise their autumn harvesting and winter planting production plans, uniformly arrange the labor force for harvesting, cultivating, planting, managing, and transporting, and actively prepare tools, seeds, and fertilizers to ensure that the harvest is fast and meticulous, and the planting is extensive and good.
    This year, the area of autumn harvest and winter planting in Fujian Province is relatively large, and the harvesting and cultivation work is relatively heavy. In the preparation of autumn harvest and winter planting, all localities have strengthened the reform of agricultural tools and the repair and manufacture of old and new, large and small agricultural tools according to these characteristics, so that the tools for autumn harvest and winter planting are prepared in large quantities and of good quality. After early planning, early arrangement, and early start to vigorously grasp the preparation of tools, Nantong Commune in Minhou County had prepared more than 1,400 pieces of new machinery such as rapid harvesters, threshing machines, and sowing machines, and more than 38,000 pieces of small farm tools, one and a half months ahead of schedule by early September, which is more than 20% more agricultural tools than those added for autumn harvest and winter planting last year. People's communes in 15 counties and cities, including Jianyang, Nanping, and Chong'an, have generally prepared more than 210,000 sets of rapid harvesters, threshing machines, potato processing machines, deep plows, land leveling machines, sowing machines, vehicles, and boats in advance for autumn harvest and winter planting according to the characteristics of autumn harvest and winter planting. At the same time, they have also reorganized and established more than 500 new-style agricultural tool cultivation stations and trained a large number of people who can repair and use new agricultural tools. While adding tools, all localities also seized the gap between farming activities to conduct inventory checks of seeds and launch mass shock fertilizer accumulation and fertilizer production movements, preparing a large number of seeds and fertilizers for expanding winter planting.
    Zhejiang: Formulate Technical Guidelines and Do a Good Job in Spring Flower Production
    (Our newspaper, Hangzhou, 24th) While vigorously grasping the management of autumn fields and striving to obtain more grain in the autumn, Zhejiang Province is rationally arranging the labor force to strive for early, extensive, and good winter planting this year, and is determined to work hard to achieve a total spring grain output that exceeds any previous year next year.
    The output of spring-flowering grain in Zhejiang Province accounts for more than 10% of the total annual grain output; more than 70% of the province's edible oil also relies on winter-sown rapeseed production. Therefore, expanding the planting area of spring flowers and doing a good job in spring flower production has become an important task of the current winter planting. According to this situation, all localities have used advanced local examples, adopted methods such as presenting facts, reasoning, accounting comparisons, and debate, so that the vast number of cadres and commune members recognize the importance and possibility of planting more and better spring grain, so that winter planting plans take root among the masses. Linhai County's Chengxi Commune expanded its winter planting area by 80,000 mu compared to last year by summarizing and promoting the experience of the Shangshan Production Team and tapping the potential of the land. Changxing County mobilized the masses to summarize the experience of winter planting last year and adopted various measures according to local conditions, so that the planned winter planting area was expanded compared to last year.
    In order to prepare for this year's winter planting work early, start early, plant more, and plant well, the Zhejiang Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China recently held various technical meetings throughout the province, focusing on discussing this year's winter planting issues, and formulated technical guidelines for seven crops, including wheat, rapeseed, spring potatoes, and vegetables, laying a good foundation for high-standard field management for winter planting this year.
    At present, all localities in the province are widely and deeply mobilizing the masses to formulate winter planting plans and various preparations, and are welcoming the arrival of the upsurge in winter planting production.
    Jiangxi: Guarantee Winter Planting on Time, with Quality, and in Quantity
    (Xinhua News Agency, Nanchang, 24th) All parts of Jiangxi Province are starting early and comprehensively preparing for winter planting to ensure the timely, high-quality, and quantitative completion and overfulfillment of this year's winter planting plan.
    This year, on the premise of first ensuring grain crops, especially vigorously developing wheat, the total area of winter-sown crops such as wheat, rapeseed, green manure, vegetables, and feed in Jiangxi Province will be expanded by 7.9 million mu compared to last year. Each county in Jiujiang Prefecture mobilized the masses, relied on the masses, and tried every means to tap the potential of the land. In addition to fully utilizing all arable land to expand the planting of wheat and rapeseed, green manure, and other crops, it also comprehensively planned 400,000 mu of lake and shoal land and mountain slope forest land below 25 degrees that can be developed and utilized to expand and mix planting of wheat, beans, rapeseed, and other crops. At present, the entire region has begun to transfer 20,000 laborers to enter the lake and shoal land, enclose lakes for reclamation, and build large "wheat lakes" and "rapeseed bays." Pingxiang County, which has always had a high winter planting index, has promoted the experience of "three rice crops and one wheat crop" (that is, planting two seasons of rice and one season of wheat on one piece of land in one year) to further expand the winter planting area, especially the wheat grain crop area, so that the county's wheat planting area is 1.6 times larger than last year. Xiushui County mobilized the masses to summarize and promote five experiences such as intercropping and reclamation, so that the county's winter planting area is more than 40% larger than last year.
    In order to guarantee the timely, high-quality, and quantitative completion and overfulfillment of the winter planting plan, all localities are seizing the opportunity to widely mobilize the masses to discuss and plan the winter sowing area, implement the area and output to the team and field, and take measures to prepare for sowing as early as possible. At present, the labor and animal power needed for winter planting have been comprehensively arranged in all localities; all existing seeds of various winter planting crops have been fully sorted, dried, and refined. In terms of tools, more than 100,000 workers in various localities have rushed to repair and manufacture more than 340,000 deep plows, more than 130,000 sowing machines, and more than 600,000 general agricultural tools for winter planting. In terms of fertilizer, many regions have prepared 30 dan of fertilizer for each mu of winter planting crops.
    Hubei: Vigorously Promote Xiangyang's Experience in Expanding Area
    (Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, 24th) According to the experience of successive summer production increases in Xiangyang region in recent years, the vast rural areas of Hubei Province are starting early and vigorously grasping the autumn sowing preparation work, which mainly includes expanding the area, deep plowing and land preparation, accumulating and delivering fertilizer, and repairing tools, and are trying every means to create conditions for increasing production next summer.
    The experience of Xiangyang region is mainly to highlight the summer harvest and early autumn crops, actively expand the summer harvest and early autumn area, and at the same time, pay attention to intensive cultivation and meticulous work, especially starting early to do a good job in deep plowing and land preparation, applying sufficient base fertilizer, and selecting fine varieties, and constantly strengthening field management. The Hubei Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China believes that these experiences in Xiangyang region are very good and calls on all localities in the province to combine with local conditions and universally and conscientiously promote these experiences. According to the spirit of the Provincial Party Committee's instructions and the experience of Xiangyang region, all localities have started a series of preparations early, the first of which is to vigorously reclaim wasteland and expand the autumn planting area. Wuhan region, which is determined to catch up with Xiangyang region, organized a special force to vigorously reclaim wasteland from July. As of mid-September, the 12 counties in the region had reclaimed more than 4 million mu of wasteland. Together with the existing cultivated land, the autumn planting area in these 12 counties this year will be about doubled compared to last year.
    While vigorously grasping the expansion of the area, all localities have also paid attention to intensive cultivation and meticulous work. In order to solve the fertilizer problem for autumn sowing, Yidu region, in addition to vigorously developing basic fertilizer accumulation and carrying out mass "three full" (manure ponds full, field ridges full, pig and cattle pens full) movements, also organized forces to rush to beat green fertilizer. In terms of tool preparation, all localities have also done a lot of work. Sui County, Zhaoyang, and other counties launched a mass movement to repair and manufacture autumn sowing tools in July and August. So far, the autumn sowing tools in these regions have been basically prepared.
    Yunnan: Use Many Years of Xiaochun Experience to Deploy Production
    (Xinhua News Agency, Kunming, 24th) Yunnan Province has fully utilized its many years of Xiaochun production experience and comprehensively launched autumn sowing preparation work according to local conditions. Some areas in the south have begun planting winter potatoes and winter sweet potatoes.
    This year, Yunnan Province not only focused on the material preparation for autumn sowing, but also focused on the preparation of production experience. About half of Yunnan's area belongs to the temperate zone, and 30% belongs to the subtropical zone, which is very beneficial for autumn sowing. In order to fully utilize this condition, the Provincial Party Committee successively held on-site meetings in Fumin County, where large areas have achieved high yields for two consecutive years, Yiliang County, where broad beans have achieved high yields in large areas, and Yuxi County, where rapeseed has achieved high yields in large areas, respectively, and summarized the production increase experience of these regions in a thorough and detailed manner. Wenshan and Honghe Autonomous Prefectures in the southern region also summarized the advanced experience of local expansion of winter potatoes, winter sweet potatoes, and other crops. In early July, the Provincial Party Committee also convened a meeting of directors of rural work departments of local party committees and county party committees, dividing the province into three different types of regions, namely northern, central, and southern, and further systematically summarized the province's autumn sowing production experience, and determined that Honghe, Wenshan, and other prefectures and autonomous prefectures in southern Yunnan will plant a large number of winter potatoes, winter sweet potatoes, winter soybeans, winter peanuts, and other crops this autumn; wheat, broad beans, and other crops should continue to be tried. The northern and central regions should continue to increase the yield per unit area and focus on planting wheat, broad beans, and potatoes.
    According to past experience, Yunnan has also decided to generally adopt small-scale water conservancy this year, especially using winter idle fields to store water, to solve the problem of water use for autumn sowing crops. At the same time, all localities are also combining fertilizer accumulation with large-scale field manure ponds, preparing to generally adopt the method of watering manure, combining fertilization and irrigation to achieve twice the result with half the effort.
    Sichuan: Combine with Current Production to Launch a Shock Fertilizer Accumulation and Fertilizer Production
    (Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, 24th) All parts of Sichuan are closely combining with current production, launching a shock fertilizer accumulation and fertilizer production campaign, and preparing a large number of high-quality fertilizers for next year's Xiaochun production as early as possible.
    Based on the spirit of grasping this year and grasping next year, all parts of Sichuan are using the current favorable opportunity of lush vegetation and broad fertilizer sources to widely launch a mass movement to prepare fertilizer early, prepare more fertilizer, and prepare good fertilizer for next year's Xiaochun. In order to ensure the smooth development of the movement and avoid competing with grain production for labor, all localities have taken many measures to closely combine the fertilizer accumulation movement with current production to achieve mutual promotion. Nanchong, Wanxian, Mianyang, and other prefectures have made full use of the late autumn field management and autumn harvest labor, combined with harvesting and management work, implemented the method of setting tasks and setting time, and rushing to clear and collect field weeds, waste stalks, and discarded leaves to accumulate and compost fertilizer. This not only accelerated the progress of management and autumn harvest, but also made full use of field debris to accumulate and produce a large amount of green manure. Suining County only spent five days of shock, not only carried out a comprehensive management of more than 150,000 mu of red sweet potatoes, corn, and cotton fields, achieving weed-free and clean fields, but also collected a large amount of weeds to compost green fertilizer. Many places have also made use of the favorable opportunity of high temperature to increase the planting of green manure as much as possible. Pixian County has made reasonable arrangements based on the growth characteristics of late autumn crops and various green manures, planting climbing vines in autumn buckwheat fields and intercropping Jiangxi sweet potatoes in mud bean fields. The county has planted more than 200,000 mu of green manure using these methods. In addition, all localities have mobilized the masses to use the opportunity of going out to work early and late to promote the method of carrying a load of manure when going out and carrying a load of green fertilizer when entering, collecting, making, and transporting them at any time, accumulating little by little, so that the fertilizer accumulation and fertilizer production work has achieved remarkable results.
    Based on the principle of adapting to local conditions and combining indigenous and foreign methods, all localities have improved fertilizer accumulation methods, innovated tools, and launched shock fertilizer accumulation competitions between communes and teams, greatly improving the efficiency of fertilizer accumulation and fertilizer production, making fertilizer accumulate more and accumulate better.

    扩大播种面积　做好各项准备　保证种多种好
    南方八省区热烈迎接冬种高潮
    广　东：要把冬种当作一造生产来抓
    本报广州24日电　广东省各地在大搞晚稻田间管理的同时，已普遍着手进行冬种的土地规划、作物茬口的安排和肥料、种籽、农具等准备
  工作。各地都决心把冬种当作一造来抓。
    广东省今年计划冬种的面积要比历史上冬种最高的年份还要多；并且确定以种植粮食为主，同时大种蔬菜、绿肥，和积极扩种其他适宜冬种的经济作物。为了保证种多种好，各地都及早进行了冬种的准备工作，并把任务和措施落实到包产单位。普宁县各公社、大队在8月间分别召开了老农座谈会、技术员会议、社员大会，通过发动群众算细账，查土地，找到了可以扩大冬种的面积有二十四万亩。为了提高土地利用率，并尽量扩大冬种面积，全省各地都决定大搞冬种作物的间种、套种。
    各地在进行土地规划、安排作物茬口的同时，还大抓种籽、肥料、农具等准备工作。化州县在8月底就组织了一个冬种种籽普查队，深入各个仓库清查种籽的储备情况，并将一百三十多万斤冬水稻、大麦、小麦、黄豆、黑豆、玉米、黄粟等种籽分别进行了化验和鉴定。电白县各公社还根据今年扩大冬种面积的要求，提早培育了两万七千多亩优良薯苗，并且发动群众筹集了其他冬耕种籽十一万八千多斤。各地农械部门也正在赶制和修配犁、耙、锄和各种小农具，以应大规模冬耕的需要。
    广　西：冬种面积超过过去任何一年
    本报南宁24日电　广西各地在加强秋收作物后期田间管理的同时，加紧冬种的准备工作。
    今年自治区各地千方百计扩大冬种面积，并把它当作一季粮食来抓，争取多收一季，变一年两熟为一年三熟。有冬种习惯的桂林专区，将比去年扩大40％；一向很少冬种的玉林专区，计划种植面积占全部水田面积的82％。全自治区今年计划冬种面积，超过以往任何一年。其中以粮食作物为主，还有绿肥和经济作物。
    早准备，以早促好，是今年冬种准备工作的特点。早在5月14日，中共广西僮族自治区党委就批转了博白县一年三熟的经验，号召各地因地制宜大力推广一年三熟。接着各地便相继制订冬种规划，自上而下层层落实，并积极进行各种思想准备和物质准备。
    完成今年庞大的冬种计划，种子的准备是一项艰巨的任务。各区除采取自繁、自选、自留、自用和相互调剂等办法解决外，自治区有关部门还从省外调进了大批种子，给缺种地区以补助。现在大麦、小麦、荞麦、蚕豆、豌豆、冬红薯等冬种粮食作物的种子已经基本备足，冬烟、绿肥等种子也部分准备就绪。
    目前，各地正进一步检查冬种准备工作，大搞冬种的肥料和工具。靖西县从8月下旬到9月20日，已积各种肥料五百四十五万担。安德公社为了减少运肥劳动力，已在田垌建立了很多肥料站，就地积储肥料。
    福　建：狠抓冬种新旧工具改革修造
    据新华社福州24日电　福建省各地人民公社，提早开展秋收和冬耕冬种的准备工作。到目前为止，全省近半数县、社的秋收冬种工具已经基本准备定当，其他各县社也都发动群众讨论和修订秋收冬种生产方案，统一安排收、耕、种、管、运的劳力，积极准备工具、种子和肥料，保证作到收得快收得细、种得多种得好。
    今年，福建省秋收冬种的面积比较大，收获和耕种工作比较繁重。在大抓秋收冬种准备工作中，各地都根据这些特点，加强农具改革和新旧、大小农具的修造工作，使秋收冬种的工具准备得又多又好。闽侯县南通公社经过早计划、早安排、早动手大抓工具准备工作后，到9月上旬就已提前一个半月备好了快速收割器、打谷机、播种机等新机具一千四百多件、小农具三万八千多件，比去年秋收冬种添制的农具还多20％以上。建阳、南平、崇安等十五个县市的人民公社，普遍根据秋收冬种的特点已提前为秋收冬种准备了快速收割器、打谷机、薯类加工机、深耕犁、平田器、播种机和车、船等二十一万多部，同时还整顿和建立了五百多个新式农具耕作站，训练了大批会修会用的新农具手。各地在添制工具的同时，还抓紧农事间隙进行清仓查种和开展群众性突击积肥造肥运动，为扩大冬种准备了大量种子和肥料。
    浙　江：制订技术纲要搞好春花生产
    本报杭州24日电　浙江省在大抓秋田管理力争秋季拿到更多的粮食的同时，合理安排劳力争取今年冬种种早、种多、种好，坚决为实现明年春粮总产量超过以往任何一年而大干一场。
    浙江省春花粮食产量占全年粮食总产量的10％以上；全省70％以上的食油也依靠冬播油菜生产，因此，扩大春花种植面积，搞好春花生产，就成为当前冬种的一项重要任务。根据这个情况，各地都运用当地的先进事例，采取摆事实，讲道理，算账对比，鸣放辩论等方法，使广大干部和社员认识到多种、种好春粮的重要性和可能性，使冬种规划在群众中落脚生根。临海县城西公社通过总结推广和尚山生产队的经验大挖土地潜力，冬种面积比去年扩大了八万亩。长兴县发动群众总结去年冬种的经验，因地制宜地采取各种办法，使冬种计划面积比去年扩大。
    为了使今年的冬种工作早准备、早动手，种得多、种得好，中共浙江省委在最近还召开了全省各种技术会议，着重讨论了今年的冬种问题，并制订了大、小麦、油茶、春马铃薯、蔬菜等七种作物的技术纲要，为今年冬种高标准田间管理打好基础。
    目前，全省各地正广泛深入地发动群众制订冬种规划和各项准备工作，迎接冬种生产高潮的到来。
    江　西：保证按时按质按量进行冬种
    据新华社南昌24日电　江西省各地及早动手全面准备冬种工作，以保证按时、按质、按量完成和超额完成今年的冬种计划。
    江西省今年在首先保证粮食作物、特别是大力发展小麦的前提下，小麦、油菜、绿肥、蔬菜和饲料等冬播作物总面积将比去年扩大七百九十万亩。九江专区各县发动群众，依靠群众，千方百计挖掘土地潜力，除充分利用一切耕地扩种大小麦和油菜、绿肥等作物外，又全面规划出可以开发利用的湖田洲地和二十五度以下的山坡林地四十万亩，扩种、混种小麦、豆类、油菜等作物。现在，全区已开始抽调两万劳动力，进入湖田洲地，围湖垦荒，大建“麦子湖”、“油菜湾”。历来冬种指数较高的萍乡县，今年为了进一步扩大冬种面积，特别是小麦粮食作物面积，发动群众总结出“稻麦三熟”（即在一块地上一年种两季水稻一季小麦）的经验加以推广，使全县小麦播种面积比去年扩大一点六倍。修水县发动群众总结推广间种、开荒等五项经验，使全县冬种面积比去年扩大40％以上。
    为了保证按时、按质、按量地完成和超额完成冬种计划，各地都抓紧时机，广泛发动群众讨论和规划冬播面积，把面积、产量落实到队到田，并且采取措施及早进行播种准备工作。目前，冬种所需要的劳力、畜力各地已全面进行了安排；已有的各种冬种作物的种子已全部进行整晒、精选。在工具方面，各地十多万工人已赶修赶制出冬种用的各种深耕犁三十四万多部，播种机十三万多部，一般农具六十多万件。在肥料方面，许多地
  区已为每亩冬种作物准备下了三十担肥料。
    湖　北：大力推广襄阳扩大面积经验
    新华社武汉24日电　湖北省广大农村根据襄阳地区几年来夏季连年增产的经验，及早动手，大抓以扩大面积、深翻整地、积肥送肥和修整工具为主要内容的秋种准备工作，千方百计地为明年夏季增产创造条件。
    襄阳地区的经验，主要是突出地抓好夏收和早秋作物，积极扩大夏收和早秋面积，同时，还注意精耕细作，特别是及早动手作好深翻整地、施足底肥和选用良种等工作，并不断地加强田间管理。中共湖北省委认为襄阳地区的这些经验是很好的，号召全省各地结合本地情况普遍认真地推广这些经验。根据省委指示精神和襄阳地区的经验，各地都及早动手进行了一系列的准备，首先是大力开荒，扩大秋种面积。决心要赶上襄阳地区的武汉地区，从7月份起，就组织专门力量大力开荒。到9月中旬止，全区十二个县已开荒四百万亩以上，连同原有耕地，这十二个县今年的秋种面积将比去年扩大一倍左右。
    各地在大抓扩大面积的同时，还都注意了精耕细作。宜都地区为解决秋种肥料问题，除大搞积肥基本建设和开展群众性的“三满”（粪池满、田头垱满、猪牛栏满）运动外，还组织力量突击打青沤肥。各地在工具准备方面，也作了许多工作。随县、枣阳等县在7、8月间就掀起了大修大造秋种工具的群众运动，到目前为止，这些地区的秋种工具都已基本准备就绪。
    云　南：运用多年小春经验布置生产
    据新华社昆明24日电　云南省充分运用多年小春生产经验，因地制宜地全面展开了秋种准备工作。南部部分地区已开始种冬马铃薯和冬红薯。
    云南省今年不仅抓紧了秋种的物质准备，并且特别抓紧了生产经验的准备。云南约有一半的地区属于温带，30％的地区属于亚热带，对秋种非常有利。为了充分利用这个条件，省委先后在连续两年获得大面积高产的富民县，蚕豆大面积高产的宜良县和油菜大面积高产的玉溪县等地，分别召开现场会议，深入细致地总结了这些地区的增产经验。南部地区的文山、红河等自治州，也分别总结了当地扩种冬马铃薯、冬红薯等作物的先进经验。7月初，省委又召开了各地委、县委农村工作部部长会议，把全省分为北部、中部、南部三种不同类型的地区，分别进一步系统地总结了全省的秋种生产经验，并确定云南南部的红河、文山等专区、自治州，今秋将大量种植冬马铃薯、冬红薯和冬黄豆、冬花生等作物；小麦、蚕豆等作物也要继续试种。北部和中部地区应继续提高单位面积产量，并以种植小麦、蚕豆和马铃薯为主。
    云南今年还根据历年经验，决定今年普遍采用小型水利，特别是利用冬闲田蓄水的办法，解决秋种作物的用水问题。同时，各地还正在结合积肥大搞田间粪塘，准备普遍采用浇粪水的办法，把施肥与灌溉结合起来，收到事半功倍的效果。
    四　川：结合当前生产突击积肥造肥
    据新华社成都24日电　四川各地紧密结合当前生产，突击积肥、造肥，及早为明年小春生产准备好大量优质肥料。
    四川各地本着一手抓今年，一手抓明年的精神，利用目前草木茂盛、肥源广阔的大好时机，广泛掀起了一个为明年小春早备肥、多备肥、备好肥的群众运动。为了使运动顺利地开展，同时避免与粮食生产互争劳力，各地采取许多措施，把积肥运动与当前生产紧密结合，作到相互促进。南充、万县、绵阳等专区都充分利用晚秋田间管理和收秋的劳力，结合收、管工作，实行定任务、定时间的办法，把田间杂草、废秆弃叶突击清除、收集起来积沤肥料，这样既加快了管理和秋收进度，同时又充分利用了田间杂物积造大量青肥。遂宁县只经过五天突击，不仅使十五万多亩红苕、玉米和棉花地进行了一次全面管理，达到草绝田净，而且采积了大量杂草沤制青肥。许多地方还利用当前气温高的有利时机，尽量增种绿肥。郫县根据晚秋作物和各种绿肥的生长特性，进行了合理搭配，在秋荞地里配种爬藤苕子，泥豆地里套种江西苕，全县用这些办法已种绿肥二十多万亩。另外，各地还发动广大群众利用早晚出工、收工的机会，推行出门一背粪、进门一背青，随采、随造、随运的办法，积少成多，使积肥造肥工作取得显著成绩。
    各地本着因地制宜、土洋结合的原则，改进积肥办法，革新工具，并在社与社、队与队之间开展突击积肥竞赛，大大提高了积肥造肥工效，使肥料积得多、积得好。（附图片）
