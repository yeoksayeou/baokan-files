    On "Seeking Scriptures"
    Lü Shufang, Worker of Harbin Xinfeng Processing Factory

    In the technical innovation and technical revolution movement centered on mechanization, semi-mechanization, automation, and semi-automation, advanced experiences are emerging endlessly. Some people describe it as a "mountain of treasures," so the practice of "seeking scriptures" from the "mountain of treasures," learning from each other, adopting each other's strengths, and improving together has become a trend. However, in the process of "seeking scriptures," some people return fully loaded, while others return empty-handed. Why do two different results occur from the same "seeking scriptures"? This is caused by two different ways of thinking. For example, some people say, "Small experience, nothing rare, not very efficient, waste of time." Under the control of this kind of thinking, even if they enter the treasure mountain, they cannot but return empty-handed.

    In contrast, the "scripture seekers" who return fully loaded believe: "Experience has sizes, but it is all a treasure," "If one workpiece can improve by a few percent, then dozens, hundreds, thousands... added up is several times the improvement." As the saying goes, "Many a little makes a mickle," that is the reason. Therefore, when they "seek scriptures," they learn from whoever has experience, immediately take them as their teacher, are modest and sincere, and are eager to learn and ask questions. Of course, such people, once they enter the treasure mountain, will definitely be able to obtain the "scriptures" and will definitely return fully loaded.

    There are also some comrades who also admit that the experience of others is advanced, but when it comes to their own work, they say, "Different trades are like different mountains; we are not in the same profession or the same type of work, so we can't use it." In fact, that is not the case. It is barely acceptable to use the phrase "different trades are like different mountains" to explain the particularities of each profession and type of work; but it is untenable to use it as a shield to prevent mutual learning between various industries. Because things, in addition to particularity, also have universality. These people only remember the saying "different trades are like different mountains," but forget the saying "different trades are not different in principle." The word "principle" refers to the internal connections and common laws between various industries.

    Therefore, if you want to enter the mountain of treasures and extract true scriptures, an important aspect is to overcome subjectivity and one-sidedness in your way of thinking and establish a dialectical materialist viewpoint and method. Otherwise, you will either not be able to obtain the scriptures, or you will not be able to use them even if you do.

    谈“取经”
    哈尔滨新风加工厂工人　吕树芳
    在以机械化半机械化、自动化半自动化为中心的技术革新和技术革命运动中，先进经验层出不穷，有人形容它像万宝山一样，于是到万宝山“取经”，互相学习，取长补短，共同提高，也就跟着成了风气。可是，在“取经”的过程中，有的人满载而归，有的人却空手而回。为什么同是“取经”，会有两种不同的结果呢？这是由两种不同的思想方法造成的。例如有的人说：“小小经验，没啥稀罕，效率不大，浪费时间”。在这种思想支配之下，他们虽然也进入宝山，不能不空手而回。
    与之相反，满载而归的“取经”者认为：“经验有大小，总归都是宝”，“一个工件能提高百分之几，那么几十个、几百个、几千个……加起来就是成几倍地提高。”俗话说“积少成多，集水成河”，就是这个道理。因此，他们“取经”时，谁有经验跟谁学，当场拜师，虚心诚恳，好学好问，当然这种人入了宝山，就一定能取到“经”，一定会满载而归了。
    还有些同志，也承认别人的经验先进，但是一联系到自己的工作，却又说“隔行如隔山，咱们同人家不是一个专业、一个工种，用不上”，其实不然。用“隔行如隔山”这句话去解释每一个专业、工种所具有的特殊性，还可以勉强说得过去；但是把它作为各个行业间不能互相学习的挡箭牌，就站不住脚了。因为事物除了特殊性，还有普遍性。这些人只记着“隔行如隔山”这句话，却忘了“隔行不隔理”这句话，这个“理”字就是指的各个行业间的内在联系和共同规律。
    所以，要想入得万宝山取出真经来，重要的一环，是克服思想方法上的主观片面性，树立辩证唯物主义的观点和方法。不然，不是取不到经，就是取到经也不会用。
