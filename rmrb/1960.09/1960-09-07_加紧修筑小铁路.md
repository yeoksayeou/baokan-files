Speed Up the Construction of Small Railways

In Guangxi, many places are speeding up the construction of small railways. Currently, there are six small railways under construction, with a total length of fifty-eight kilometers.

After these small railways are completed, they will mainly undertake the short-distance transportation of key materials such as iron ore, manganese ore, coal, and timber, which will play an important role in the ongoing increase production and practice economy movement throughout the autonomous region. Currently, the Chating Iron Mine in Xing'an County has to use trucks to detour more than 20 kilometers to transport ore to Xing'an County Railway Station, and then load the ore onto trains from Xing'an Railway Station to transport it to steel plants. After the Yan-Cha Railway is open to traffic, the ore can be directly loaded onto trains from the mining area and directly transported to various steel plants.

    加紧修筑小铁路
    广西不少地方正在加紧修筑小铁路，目前施工的有六条小铁路，共长五十八公里。
    这些小铁路建成以后，主要是承担铁矿石，锰矿石，煤炭，以及木材等重点物资的短途运输任务，对于全自治区正在开展的增产节约运动，将起重要的作用。兴安县的茶亭铁矿现在用汽车绕道二十多公里，才能把矿石运到兴安县火车站，然后再从兴安火车站把矿石装上火车运到钢铁厂；严茶铁路通车后，矿石就可以直接从矿区装上火车，直接运到各钢铁厂。
