(Xinhua News Agency, Hefei, September 2nd) Zhu Mingzhang, First Secretary of the Liu'an County Committee of the Communist Party of China, Anhui Province, reports: The Su埠 Commune in Liu'an County has made thorough preparations early and scientifically arranged labor, thereby effectively completing the large-scale and diverse harvest work.

This commune has more than 62,400 mu of crops for spring planting and autumn harvest, and summer planting and autumn harvest (such as intermediate corn). Not only is the autumn harvest task heavy, but the types of harvested crops are also very diverse. It is necessary to harvest rice and early grain crops, as well as various economic crops. Moreover, in the early stage of the early autumn harvest, it is necessary to seize the time to plant a season of late autumn crops.

In this very complex autumn harvest situation, the Su埠 Commune gave full play to the incomparable superiority of the People's Commune, excavated and concentrated all forces within the entire commune, strengthened the main attack line of the autumn harvest, and scientifically arranged and used labor, prompting the autumn harvest work to progress quickly, well, and solidly. All of the commune's more than 14,000 mu of jute and more than 1,200 mu of spring corn have been harvested. The harvest of jute has truly achieved leaving no stubble in the field and cutting the heads no more than an inch. The harvest of corn has been achieved by cutting the stalks cleanly and harvesting all the cobs. The harvest of mid-season rice has entered a tense stage. As of August 22, more than 6,800 mu have been harvested. After inspection and acceptance, the harvesting of mid-season rice has also met the requirements of no missing plants in the field, no dropping ears on the road, and no scattering grains on the threshing ground. The harvest of mid-season corn, cotton, sesame, and other crops has also been done very carefully.

The reason why this commune's autumn crop harvest work can be done while ripening and harvesting completely is mainly because leaders at all levels went deep into the front line, divided areas for contracting, and earnestly grasped the following two points:

	(1) An early start is a hundred early starts; be proactive in everything. When the summer harvest was basically over, the commune party committee mobilized teams and groups to conscientiously summarize the summer harvest experience and carefully formulate an autumn harvest work plan. Along with the discussion and formulation of the plan, preparations for various tools were started. The commune added five threshing machines, more than 6,500 rice baskets, and more than 14,000 other small autumn harvest tools, ensuring that there was no shortage of tools for harvesting, transporting, threshing, and storing. The commune has 98 large areas of mid-season rice and large areas of corn, each exceeding 100 mu. 298 threshing grounds were established in these areas, and 737 temporary warehouses were built along with the threshing grounds. In this way, the reasonable layout of fields and threshing grounds, and threshing grounds and warehouses, shortened the transportation mileage, saved transportation labor, and reduced labor intensity.

	(2) Scientifically arrange labor, and carry out harvesting, management, and planting alternately. Adopt a system of labor concentration, clever arrangement, fixed quotas with three guarantees, and strict inspection and acceptance.

First, concentrate labor. More than 1,600 laborers were drawn from industry, sideline occupations, and logistics departments to ensure that 85% of all labor was put into the autumn harvest front. More than 6,000 people were also drawn from commerce, government offices, and teachers and students from schools to support the autumn harvest. Second, arrange cleverly. Professional teams were organized separately for harvesting and field management. Large-scale operations were used to harvest large areas of crops, while small-scale troops were used for harvesting scattered crops and other miscellaneous work on the threshing ground. Strong troops were used to focus on mid-season rice, corn, and other major crops; weaker half-laborers and auxiliary laborers were used to fight sporadic battles for cotton, sesame, and other minor crops that ripen in stages. Some auxiliary laborers who could not go out were assigned household chores, such as peeling jute, tearing corn husks, and shelling corn kernels. In this way, it was achieved that everyone had something to do, everything was taken care of, and there were no idle people at home or outside.

Each production team set labor quotas for all kinds of agricultural work, universally promoted small-segment contracting, strictly implemented the "four fixings" (fixed tasks, fixed quality, fixed time, fixed work points) and "one reward" method, fully mobilized the enthusiasm of commune members for production, and strengthened their sense of responsibility. Different labor quotas were also set for cutting jute, moving corn, picking cotton, thinning sesame, picking tea seeds, and miscellaneous work on the threshing ground and in the fields, according to their different circumstances. In this way, all kinds of agricultural work were carried out by small-segment contracting, and examples of labor exceeding the quota and agricultural work exceeding the quality standard emerged one after another.

In order to ensure and improve the quality of agricultural work, each production team established an inspection and acceptance team, conscientiously implemented the inspection and evaluation system, and summarized and promoted experiences at all levels in a timely manner to promote the continuous progress of the autumn harvest movement.

    干部深入领导　科学安排劳力　及早备齐工具
    苏埠公社秋收工作扎扎实实又快又好
    本报合肥2日电　中共安徽省六安县委第一书记朱明章报道：六安县苏埠公社由于及早作好准备工作，科学安排劳力，从而切切实实地做好了面积大而又种类繁多的收获工作。
    这个公社共有春种秋收和夏种秋收（如中玉米等）的作物六万二千四百多亩。不仅秋收任务重，而且收获的作物种类很多，既要收水稻和早粮作物，又要收多种经济作物，而且在收获早秋的初期还要及时抢种一季晚晚秋作物。
    处于这种十分复杂的秋收情况下，苏埠公社充分发挥了人民公社的无比优越性，从全社范围内挖掘和集中了一切力量，加强了秋收主攻战线，并科学地安排和使用了劳动力，促使秋收工作进展得既快又好，扎扎实实。全社一万四千多亩大麻和一千二百多亩春玉米，已全部收获完毕。大麻的收获真正做到了留茬不出地，斩头不超寸；玉米的收获作到了砍净秸收净棒。中稻收获已进入紧张阶段，到8月22日止已收割六千八百多亩。经检查验收，中稻的收割也做到田不漏棵，路不丢穗，场不撒粒的要求。中玉米、棉花、芝麻等作物的收获，也都做得很细致。
    这个公社秋季作物收获工作所以能够做到边熟边收和收全收好，主要是由于各级领导干部深入第一线，划片包干，认真抓住了以下两条：
      （一）一早百早，万事主动。当夏收基本结束后，公社党委就发动队队、组组认真总结夏收经验，并周密地订出了秋收工作计划。随着计划的讨论和制定，就着手各种工具的准备。全社共增添了五部脱粒机、六千五百多副稻篓子，以及其它秋收小型工具一万四千多件，收割、运输、晒场、进仓等工具要啥有啥，样样不缺。全社一百亩以上的大面积中稻和大面积玉米共有九十八片，以片建立了二百九十八处晒场，随场还修建了七百三十七处临时仓库。这样，片与场、场与库合理布局，缩短了运输里程，可节省运输劳力和减轻了劳动强度。
      （二）科学安排劳力，收、管、种交错进行。采取劳力大集中、巧安排、定额三包工和严格的检查验收制度。
    首先是集中劳力，从工业、副业、后勤等部门，抽出劳力一千六百多人，保证全部劳力的85％投入秋收战线。又从商业、机关、学校师生中抽出六千多人，支援秋收。其次是巧安排。收割和田间管理分别组织了专业队。收割大片作物即用大兵团作战，零星作物收获和其它场上的杂活即以小部队活动。中稻和玉米等大宗作物，使用强兵主攻；棉花、芝麻等分期成熟的小宗作物则用较弱的半劳力和辅助劳力打零星战。还有一些不能出门的辅助劳力，就安排一些家里农活给他们做，如剥麻、撕玉米包皮、剥玉米粒子等。这样，就达到了人人有事干、事事有人管，人尽其用，家里家外无闲人。
    各个生产队对各项农活都订出劳动定额，普遍推行小段包工，严格执行“四定”（定任务、定质量、定时间、定工分）、“一奖”的办法，充分调动社员生产积极性和加强责任心。对砍麻、搬玉米、拾棉花、间芝麻、摘种茶以及场头地间的杂活等，也根据其不同情况，订出各有不同的劳动定额。这样，样样农活实行小段包工，劳动超定额，农活超质量的事例层出不穷。
    为了保证提高农活质量，各生产队都成立了检查验收小组，认真执行检查评比制度，并层层总结经验，及时推广，以推动秋收运动不断向前进展。（附图片）
