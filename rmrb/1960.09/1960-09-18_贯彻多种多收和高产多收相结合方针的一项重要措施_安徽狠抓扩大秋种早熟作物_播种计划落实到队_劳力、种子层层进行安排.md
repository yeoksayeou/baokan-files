Xinhua News Agency, Hefei, 16th -- In the spirit of vigorously developing agriculture and grain production, Anhui Province has made unified and reasonable arrangements for the current autumn sowing stubble and the stubble for grain and other crops for the entire next year. After rational arrangement, the province's autumn sowing area this autumn will account for about 70% of the total cultivated area, of which autumn-sown early-maturing crops will account for more than 25% of the autumn sowing area.

Reasonably arranging stubble and expanding the area of autumn-sown early-maturing crops is an extremely important measure for Anhui Province to implement the policy of taking grain as the key link, combining multiple cropping and increased production with high yield and increased production, and ensuring increased grain production. Before formulating this measure, Anhui Province first summarized the experience of various places in reasonably arranging stubble and expanding the area of autumn-sown early-maturing crops to increase production. Judging from the summarized experience, reasonably arranging stubble and expanding autumn-sown early-maturing crops has five major advantages: First, reasonably arranging stubble and expanding autumn-sown early-maturing crops can fully tap the potential of the land, increase land utilization rate, and change one crop a year into two crops a year, or two crops a year into three crops a year. For example, some communes in the Huaihe River area that grow rice and some communes in the Yangtze River area that grow double-cropping rice plant some early-maturing summer-harvested crops in the winter fallow fields before rice is planted, harvest them and then plant rice again, and after the rice is harvested, plant another season of autumn-maturing crops, so that three seasons of crops can be planted and harvested in one year. Second, it is convenient to arrange various agricultural tasks such as harvesting, planting, and management. The Houying Production Team of Shagou Commune in Huaiyuan County, due to the expansion of the area of autumn-sown early-maturing crops last year, completed harvesting and planting more than ten days before Grain Full, spreading the agricultural tasks that originally had to be done in fifteen days over twenty-seven days. This not only eased the tension of labor during the harvest, planting, and management period, but also enabled the entire summer planting task to be completed about twenty days earlier than in previous years. Third, it is convenient for the rational use of fertilizers and water sources throughout the year. Fourth, it can increase the proportion of summer-harvested grain in the whole year. Fifth, expanding the area of summer-harvested early-maturing crops can also avoid natural disasters such as water, drought, insects, and wind to a certain extent between spring and summer, and achieve increased production and multiple harvests. On the basis of summarizing the experience of reasonably arranging stubble and expanding autumn-sown early-maturing crops, various places mobilized the vast number of cadres and commune members to discuss and arrange the autumn sowing stubble this autumn and the stubble for grain and other crops for the entire next year. In the arrangement of autumn sowing stubble, various places in the province arranged the area of summer-harvested early-maturing crops to account for more than 25% of the entire autumn sowing area, and the area of early-maturing crops increased significantly compared with last year. At present, various places in the province have implemented the autumn sowing plan down to the team, and the stubble has been implemented down to the field. The autumn sowing plan of Bengbu Prefecture has been expanded by 5% compared with last year. In order to plant autumn-sown crops in a timely manner, they have been ranked according to different stubble such as early autumn, mid-autumn, and late autumn, and the autumn sowing plan has been implemented to plots of land.

Based on the comprehensive implementation of autumn sowing stubble, from the provincial party committee to the local party committees, county party committees, and commune party committees, inspections and preparations have been carried out level by level on labor, seeds, fertilizers, tools, and other issues. In order to ensure the multiple planting of early-maturing crops, various places have solved the problem of insufficient seeds of early-maturing crops through methods such as mutual adjustment between communes and between teams. Various places have adopted various effective measures to complete all agricultural tasks that can be done in advance as much as possible, so as to ensure that 80% of the labor force is put into autumn harvesting and autumn planting. In terms of fertilizer preparation, for example, Bengbu Prefecture is carrying out large-scale fertilizer accumulation in combination with field management, and the daily fertilizer accumulation is more than 40 million dan. Liu'an Prefecture has adopted a combination of professional and intensive methods to carry out a large-scale fertilizer accumulation and production campaign. It has accumulated a large amount of native miscellaneous fertilizer through methods such as fumigation, exchange, soaking, making, and salvaging. Tool preparation is also in full swing. Liu'an Prefecture has currently manufactured more than 13,000 roller-type strip seeders, more than 1,700 double-row and triple-row strip seeders, and repaired and manufactured 1.99 million pieces of various large and small agricultural tools.

### 贯彻多种多收和高产多收相结合方针的一项重要措施  安徽狠抓扩大秋种早熟作物  播种计划落实到队　劳力、种子层层进行安排

    贯彻多种多收和高产多收相结合方针的一项重要措施
    安徽狠抓扩大秋种早熟作物
    播种计划落实到队　劳力、种子层层进行安排
    新华社合肥16日电　安徽省各地本着大办农业，大办粮食的精神，对当前秋种茬口和明年全年粮食等作物的茬口，统一进行了合理安排。经过合理安排以后，全省今秋秋种的面积将占总耕地面积的70％左右，其中秋种早熟作物又占秋种面积的25％以上。
    合理安排茬口，扩大秋种早熟作物的面积，是安徽省贯彻以粮为纲以及多种多收和高产多收相结合的方针，保证粮食增产的一项极为重要的措施。安徽省在制定这一措施之前，首先总结了各地合理安排茬口，扩大秋种早熟作物面积的增产经验。从总结出的经验看，合理安排茬口，扩大秋种早熟作物，有五大好处：一、合理安排茬口，扩大秋种早熟作物可以充分挖掘土地潜力，提高土地利用率，变一年一熟为一年二熟或变一年二熟为一年三熟。如淮北种植水稻地区的一部分公社和沿江地区种植双季稻的一部分公社，把水稻前茬的冬闲田种上一些早熟的夏收作物，收后再栽水稻，水稻收后再种一季秋熟作物，这样一年就可种三季收三季作物。二、便于安排收、种、管各项农活。怀远县沙沟公社候营生产队，由于去年秋种早熟作物面积的扩大，今年在小满前十多天即收完种完，把原来集中在十五天要做的农活，提前分散在二十七天来完成，这不仅缓和了收、种、管期间劳动力的紧张，而且使整个夏种任务比往年提前二十天左右的时间结束。三、便于全年合理使用肥料和水源。四、可以提高夏收粮食在全年中的比重。五、扩大夏收早熟作物的面积，还可在一定程度上避开春夏之间的水、旱、虫、风等自然灾害的袭击，达到增产多收。在总结合理安排茬口、扩大秋种早熟作物经验的基础上，各地发动广大干部和社员讨论和安排了今秋秋种茬口和明年全年粮食等作物的茬口。在秋种茬口的安排中，全省各地安排夏收早熟作物的面积占整个秋种面积的25％以上，早熟作物的面积比去年大大增加。目前，全省各地已把秋种计划落实到队，茬口落实到田。蚌埠专区秋种计划比去年扩大5％，为了适时把秋种作物种下去，根据早秋、中秋、晚秋等不同茬口，进行了排队，把秋种计划落实到地块。
    全省各地根据秋收作物早秋、中秋、晚秋收获期不一的情况，还合理地安排了早熟作物品种的下种时间。沿江地区准备把冬性强、早熟的“三月黄”、“矮粒多”小麦，在寒露开始进行播种；春性强的“南大二四一九”小麦，在霜降前后播种；青稞麦在立冬后播种；并力争多套种一些豌豆、蚕豆、萝卜、蔬菜。沿淮地区准备把冬性强、早熟的“早洋麦”、“三月黄”、“矮粒多”小麦，在寒露前播种；春性强的“南大二四一九”小麦，在霜降前播种。
    在秋种茬口全面落实的基础上从省委到各地委、县委、公社党委，已对劳力、种子、肥料、工具等问题，层层进行了检查和准备。为了保证多种早熟作物，各地通过社与社，队与队相互调剂等办法，解决了早熟作物种子不足问题。各地采取各种有效措施，把当前一切可以提前做的农活，尽量提前做完，以便保证拿出80％的劳力投入秋收秋种。在肥料准备方面，如蚌埠专区结合田间管理大搞积肥，每天积肥量都在四千多万担以上。六安专区采取专业性和突击性相结合的办法，大搞积肥、造肥运动，通过熏、换、沤、制、捞等办法，已积了大量的土杂肥。工具准备也在紧张进行。六安专区目前已制造磙筒条播器一万三千多部，双行和三行条播器一千七百多部，修制各种大小农具一百九十九万件。
