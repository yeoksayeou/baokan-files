Phoenix from the Garbage Heap
Yu Li

In the southern district of Guangzhou, there is a Huaxie Mountain (Flower Shoe Mountain). Legend has it that in ancient times, there was a poor girl who was forced into prostitution. Later, she met a poor scholar, and they fell in love and made a marriage agreement. Unexpectedly, the madam forced her to marry a merchant. The girl refused and angrily threw herself into the Pearl River. The scholar was filled with grief and buried one of her remaining flower shoes on this barren land. Flower Shoe Mountain got its name from this. This folk tale, filled with the blood and tears of oppressed women, has now been replaced by the moving deeds of nine poor women here who started a factory from scratch. People say that a phoenix has risen from Flower Shoe Mountain. It is believed that saying these nine women are the epitome of working women in New China is not an exaggeration.

These nine women originally relied on government relief or their husbands' living allowances to make ends meet. However, as soon as they heard the Party's call to develop street industries, they thought, "When the poor think of change, they want to work, they want revolution." A sixty-three-year-old retired textile worker took out eight yuan from her years of accumulated "coffin money," bought twelve bamboo poles, and set up a shed on Flower Shoe Mountain. They operated on the condition of providing environmental sanitation for factories, obtaining the opportunity to clean furnace slag, pick up scrap iron, and collect coke. Some people called it a garbage factory. However, with revolutionary spirit, a phoenix can rise from a garbage heap.

The growth process of this factory can be described with eight "froms": from a garbage factory to a comprehensive factory encompassing casting, hardware, and chemicals; capital, from eight yuan to forty thousand yuan; workers, from nine to one hundred and fifty-four; technology, from not being able to distinguish between wrought iron and pig iron to being able to cast large flywheels weighing several hundred kilograms and delicate small gears; equipment, from one water tank and two bamboo sieves to electric sand sieves and semi-mechanized coal sieves; products, from picking up scrap iron and collecting coke to producing castings, ferrous sulfate, and barium sulfide; output value, from a daily output of ten yuan to thirty thousand yuan; living welfare, from receiving relief and living allowances to receiving fixed wages, and children attending the factory-run nursery. However, what is even more touching is their revolutionary spirit of striving for self-improvement and their revolutionary perseverance in hard work. When Comrade Chen Yu, Secretary of the Guangdong Provincial Party Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, visited their factory, Sister Chen Jin, who rose from a water dweller to become the factory director, said with trembling lips: "Leader, there is nothing to see here." Comrade Chen Yu replied with a smile: "No, I am not here to see your factory buildings, but to see your spirit!" Indeed, everything in their factory embodies the victory of the "poor stick" spirit.

What force transformed that old woman's eight yuan of "coffin money" into forty thousand yuan of socialist enterprise capital? What force enabled this factory's foundation to go from nothing to something, from small to large? There is no element of chance here. It all depends on their poverty that is hard, poverty that is tenacious, poverty that has ambition, poverty that has ideals, poverty that works practically. In a word, it all depends on the "poor stick" spirit. Otherwise, the old woman's highest ideal would be a good coffin, a burial place after death, and not the major event of socialist industrial construction. Otherwise, where would several uneducated and unskilled housewives get such lofty ideals, such great ambitions, such strong perseverance? You see, at the beginning of their factory's construction, some people ridiculed them for running a garbage factory. Once, because they couldn't distinguish, they sold wrought iron and pig iron mixed together, and people pointed at their noses and scolded them for deceiving the state. When the factory director attended the street industry meeting, almost no one in the industry knew that there was a factory on Flower Shoe Mountain. However, all this only strengthened their ambitions even more. They firmly believed that "the Party called on us to run street industries, and there will be no future without it." Supported by this strong belief, they strove for self-improvement and worked diligently, improved management, reformed tools, and improved technology. In just a few months, the profits turned over to the state increased month by month, and the output value indicators went from ten yuan per month to one thousand yuan, three thousand yuan... becoming the upstream unit of the street industry, telling people with moving achievements: There is a factory on Flower Shoe Mountain that started from scratch! A phoenix can rise from a garbage heap!

It is also entirely due to the "poor stick" spirit that they have blazed new trails where there were no roads, seen the factors of smoothness in difficulties, and believed in success in failures. When their factory was still in a difficult situation, they were not intimidated by the difficulties, nor were they bewildered by the difficulties, but were steadfast and down-to-earth, determined to expand the casting business and create new horizons. Factory director Chen Jin went to a large factory and received a batch of orders for casting flywheels. This can indeed be regarded as a bold and courageous move. In fact, no one in the factory knew how to turn sand molds. However, Chen Jin said to her sisters: "What's so great about it? Isn't it just like printing cakes?" Don't think this is frivolous. It is actually the heroic nature of despising difficulties. In their actual actions, they fully estimated the technical difficulties, took a step-by-step approach, mobilized, organized forces to learn sand turning, humbly asked the master craftsmen for advice when cleaning furnace slag in the foundry, and went to the Guangzhou Technical Innovation Exhibition to learn from experience, studying the sand molds for several days and nights in the sand pit. Victory ultimately belongs to those who despise difficulties strategically and value difficulties tactically. The flywheel was manufactured, and the factory's difficult hurdle was overcome.

In our country, under the radiance of the three red banners of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Commune, the "poor stick" spirit is becoming more and more vigorous. Factories, enterprises, communes, schools... that start from scratch are everywhere. The phoenix on Flower Shoe Mountain is just one example.

    垃圾堆上出凤凰
    于厘
    广州南区有个花鞋山。传说古时有个穷家女，被迫沦为娼，后来遇上一位穷书生，情投意合约订了婚期，谁料鸨母迫她嫁作商人妇，女子不从，愤然投珠江自尽。书生悲痛万分，把所遗花鞋一只葬在这个荒地上，花鞋山便从此得名。这个充满着被压迫妇女血泪的民间传说，现在已经被这里的九个贫穷妇女白手起家办工厂的动人事迹所代替了。人们说，花鞋山上出凤凰，这九个妇女是新中国劳动妇女形象的缩影。相信这样说，一点也不算夸张。
    这九位妇女原来都是靠政府救济或靠丈夫领生活困难补助费维持家计。可是，一听到党号召发展街道工业，她们便“穷则思变，要干，要革命”。一位六十三岁退休了的纺织女工从多年积蓄的“棺材本”中拿出八块钱，买了十二条竹子在花鞋山架起工棚，经营的是以代工厂搞环境卫生为条件，取得清炉碴的机会，拾废铁，拣焦炭。有人叫它做垃圾厂。然而，革命精神所到，垃圾堆上能够出凤凰。
    用八个“从”字可以道出这个工厂的成长历程，那就是：从垃圾厂到铸造、五金、化工综合工厂；资金，从八元增长到四万元；工人，从九个增加到一百五十四个；技术，从黑白口铁不分到会铸造几百斤重的大飞轮和精致的小齿轮；设备，从一个水缸，两个竹筛子到电动筛沙机和半机械化的筛煤机；产品，从拾废铁、拣焦炭到出产铸件、青矾、硫化钡；产值，从日产十元增到三万元；生活福利，从领救济、生活补助款到领固定工资，儿女进厂办的托儿所。然而，更感动人的是她们的发愤图强的革命精神和艰苦奋斗的革命毅力。中共广东省委书记陈郁同志到她们厂里访问时，由水上居民出身当上了厂长的陈金大姐激动到嘴唇发颤地说：“首长，我们这里没有什么好看的。”陈郁同志笑着答道：“不，我不是来看你们的厂房，而是看你们的精神！”的确，她们厂里的一事一物，都体现着“穷棒子”精神的胜利。
    什么力量使那位老婆婆的八块钱“棺材本”一变而为四万元的社会主义企业资金？什么力量使这个厂的家底从无到有，从小到大？这里并无半点儿偶然的因素，全靠她们穷得硬，穷得韧，穷得有志气，穷得有理想，穷得脚踏实地干，一句话，全靠“穷棒子”精神。要不然，那位老婆婆的理想最高是一副好棺材，死有葬身之所，而不会是社会主义工业建设的大事。要不然，几位没文化、没技术的家庭妇女哪里会有这么高尚的理想，这么大的志气，这么刚强的毅力？你看，她们建厂之初，有人讥笑她们办的是垃圾厂，曾经因为不会鉴别，把黑白口铁混在一起卖，被人指着鼻子骂她们欺骗国家。厂长参加街道工业会议，几乎没有哪个同行知道花鞋山有个工厂。然而，这一切反而更加坚定她们的雄心壮志，她们只是坚信“党叫我们办街道工业，不会没有前途”。在这个坚强的信念支持下，她们发愤图强，踏踏实实地干，改善经营，改革工具，提高技术，不过几个月的工夫，上缴利润逐月增加，产值指标从月产十元而千元，三千元……成为街道工业的上游单位，以感人的成就告诉人们：花鞋山上有个白手起家的工厂！垃圾堆里能够出凤凰！
    也是全靠“穷棒子”精神，使她们从没有路中踏出新路，在困难中看到顺利的因素，在失败中坚信能够成功，当她们工厂还处于困难重重的时候，她们不被困难吓倒，也没有被困难弄得眼花缭乱，而是坚定不移，脚踏实地，决定扩充铸件业务，创造新的天地，厂长陈金走到大工厂一兜，就接回来一批铸造飞轮的订货，这确实算得上心壮胆粗了，其实厂里并没有哪一个人懂得翻沙造型，可是陈金对姊妹们说：“有什么了不起，还不是像印饼一样。”别以为这话出于轻佻，其实是藐视困难的英雄本色。她们在实际行动中，完全估计到技术的困难，步步为营，做动员，组织力量学翻沙，去铸造厂清炉碴时虚心向师傅请教，又去广州技术革新展览会取经，几天几夜围在沙池里对着砂模钻研。胜利，终归属于在战略上藐视困难、在战术上重视困难的人，飞轮制造出来了，厂的困难关突破了。
    在我们的国家里，在总路线、大跃进、人民公社三面红旗的辉映下，“穷棒子”精神越来越昂扬，白手起家的工厂、企业、公社、学校……比比皆是，花鞋山上的凤凰，只是一个例子而已。
