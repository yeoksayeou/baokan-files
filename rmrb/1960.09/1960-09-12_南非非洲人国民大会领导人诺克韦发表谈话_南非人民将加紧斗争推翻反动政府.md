Xinhua News Agency, Johannesburg, 11th - Nokwe, one of the leaders of the South African African National Congress, recently issued a statement regarding the South African Federal authorities' continued ban on the National Congress' activities and the continued imprisonment of its leaders, saying: "Despite [the South African authorities] banning our party and massively imprisoning party leaders, I have never been so confident in the achievement of our freedom as I am today."

He said: "All this cannot stop the people [of South Africa] from achieving their goals. Imprisoning the people's leaders will only make them stronger and consolidate their unity. They are now even more determined to lead the people in the struggle for liberation. Our current task is to overthrow the disastrous National Party government [of South Africa] in the shortest possible time."

At the end of March this year, in order to step up the suppression of the struggle launched by the South African people, centered on opposing the "Pass Laws," the South African authorities declared a "state of emergency" in many parts of South Africa, ordering the banning of activities of organizations such as the South African African National Congress, and wantonly arresting people who opposed racial discrimination policies.

News reports say that under pressure from public opinion at home and abroad, although the South African authorities were recently forced to end the "state of emergency," twenty-nine South African people's leaders, including many leaders of the African National Congress, are still to be tried. Their "crime" is participating in the "treason case" fabricated by the South African authorities in 1956.

These leaders recently met with reporters from the South African "Golden City Post" and firmly stated: "The struggle will continue."

Xinhua News Agency, Pretoria, 2nd - On August 31st, the South African Federal authorities unreasonably fined the President of the South African African National Congress, Luthuli, one hundred pounds or twelve months in prison, for the "crime" of taking the lead in burning "passes" to protest the South African authorities' racial discrimination policies.

Luthuli was arrested on March 30th this year along with some other South African African leaders who opposed racial discrimination. At that time, a vigorous mass struggle against the "pass system" was unfolding throughout South Africa. The South African African National Congress had called on the people to resolutely oppose the "Pass Laws" that restricted the movement of Africans. In order to suppress the South African people's struggle for freedom, the South African authorities, while shooting and wantonly arresting Africans, also ordered a ban on the activities of the South African African National Congress and another African organization, the Pan-Africanist Congress.

Luthuli and others were subjected to cruel treatment after their arrest. It is reported that Luthuli is currently suffering from a serious heart condition.

    南非非洲人国民大会领导人诺克韦发表谈话
    南非人民将加紧斗争推翻反动政府
    新华社11日讯　约翰内斯堡消息：南非非洲人国民大会领导人之一诺克韦最近就南非联邦当局继续禁止国民大会活动和继续监禁它的领袖发表谈话说：“尽管（南非当局）禁止我们的党和大批监禁党的领袖，但是，我从没有像今天那样对我们自由的成就充满信心”。
    他说：“所有这一切不能阻止（南非）人民来达到他们的目的。监禁人民的领袖只会使他们坚强起来和巩固他们的团结。他们现在更加坚决地领导人民进行解放斗争。我们目前的任务是要在尽短时间内推翻祸国殃民的（南非联邦）国民党政府。”
    今年3月底，南非当局为了加紧镇压南非人民掀起的以反对“通行证法”为中心的斗争，在南非许多地方宣布“紧急状态”，下令禁止南非非洲人国民大会等组织的活动，并大肆逮捕反对种族歧视政策的人士。
    消息说，在国内外舆论的压力下，南非当局最近虽然被迫结束了“紧急状态”，但是包括非洲人国民大会许多领袖在内的二十九位南非人民领袖，仍要受审。他们的“罪名”是参与了南非当局在1956年捏造的“叛国案”。
    这些领袖最近会见南非“金城邮报”的记者时坚决表示：“斗争将继续下去。”
    新华社2日讯　比勒陀利亚消息：南非联邦当局8月31日无理判处南非非洲人国民大会主席卢图利一百镑罚款或十二个月监禁，“罪名”是他带头烧毁“通行证”抗议南非当局的种族歧视政策。
    卢图利是今年3月30日和其他一些反对种族歧视的南非非洲人领袖一起被捕的。当时，南非全国展开着轰轰烈烈的反对“通行证制度”的群众斗争。南非非洲人国民大会曾号召人民坚决反对限制非洲人行动的“通行证法”。南非当局为了镇压南非人民争取自由的斗争，在枪杀和大肆逮捕非洲人的同时，还下令禁止南非非洲人国民大会和另一个非洲人组织泛非主义者大会的活动。
    卢图利等人被捕后曾受到残酷的待遇，据报道，目前，卢图利正患着严重的心脏病。
