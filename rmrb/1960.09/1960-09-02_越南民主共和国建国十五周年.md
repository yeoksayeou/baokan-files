    The 15th Anniversary of the Founding of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam
    Sun Desheng, Vice President of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam
    Fifteen years ago, on September 2, 1945, President Ho Chi Minh read the Vietnamese "Declaration of Independence" in Ba Dinh Square, Hanoi, and the Democratic Republic of Vietnam was born. This was the result of the Vietnamese people's nearly century-long resistance against French colonists, the result of fifteen years of heroic struggle and wise leadership by the Indochinese Communist Party, the predecessor of the Vietnamese Labor Party, and the result of the Viet Minh Front's armed strikes against French colonists and expulsion of Japanese fascists, enabling the "August Revolution" to rapidly achieve a glorious victory throughout the country. This victory ended more than eighty years of rule by imperialist colonists in Vietnam and thousands of years of rule by feudal emperors, opening a new era in the history of the Vietnamese nation.
    After the Vietnamese people took power into their own hands, they have achieved brilliant successes in the cause of defending and building the motherland over the past fifteen years.
    Victory in the War of Resistance
    As World War II had just ended and our people's democratic state had just been established, the Vietnamese people and the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam were eager for peace in order to heal the wounds of war and build the motherland. However, only three weeks after the establishment of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, while facing extremely serious difficulties, French colonial troops, under the cover of British troops disarming the Japanese fascist forces, immediately began a war of aggression against Vietnam. The French colonists gradually expanded their scope of aggression from southern Vietnam, tearing up the March 6, 1946 agreement and the September 14 temporary agreement signed by the French government and the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, which aimed to maintain peace in Vietnam. On December 19, 1946, the nationwide war of resistance broke out. The entire Vietnamese people, responding to President Ho Chi Minh's call, rose up unanimously to resist the enemy and save the country.
    An extremely arduous and incomparably heroic war of resistance lasted for eight or nine years. The French colonists had a professional army equipped with the latest weapons, and received assistance from American imperialism in terms of money, weapons, and plans, while the Vietnamese people initially had only homemade guns and sticks, and it can be said that they only had bare hands. However, due to the close unity of the people and their determination not to be slaves again, and due to the wise leadership of the Vietnamese Labor Party, the Vietnamese people continued to achieve victories, and finally achieved the historically significant victory of the Dien Bien Phu campaign in May 1954.
    The victory of the Vietnamese people's war of resistance, as well as the movement of fraternal socialist countries, the French people, and the people of the world demanding the realization of peace in Indochina, prompted the convening and success of the Geneva Conference, shattering the conspiracy of American imperialism to delay and expand the Indochina war. The Geneva Accords signed on July 20, 1954, ended the war in Indochina on the basis of recognizing the independence, sovereignty, unity, and territorial integrity of Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos. This was a great victory for the Asian-African national independence movement and the struggle to defend world peace.
    Building North Vietnam
    After the restoration of peace, North Vietnam broke free from the shackles of imperialism, achieved complete liberation, completed the national people's democratic revolution, and entered the period of transition to socialism.
    The feudal colonial system and fifteen years of war left North Vietnam devastated. However, thanks to the heroic struggle and enthusiastic labor of the Vietnamese people, coupled with the selfless assistance of fraternal socialist countries, only two years after taking over the entire North Vietnam, land reform was completed, the task of restoring the national economy to pre-war levels was completed, and the 1958-1960 Three-Year Plan aimed at strengthening socialist transformation, initially developing the economy and culture, and actively preparing for socialist industrialization was launched.
    In the work of building North Vietnam, the achievements we have made are very significant. In the five years from 1955 to 1959, in agriculture, output increased by 52.6% (compared to the pre-war period, the average rice harvest per capita increased by 66%). In industry, ninety-one important state-owned enterprises were newly built, the total output value of state-owned industry increased sixteen times, and the total output value of handicrafts and private industry increased by 65%. In commerce, the total retail sales of commodities increased by 99%, and exports increased eight times. In terms of medical and health services, the number of medical institutions doubled. In terms of culture and education, illiteracy has been basically eliminated, the number of university students has increased seven times, the number of books published annually has increased threefold, and the total number of students in ordinary schools and enlightenment classes in the 1959-1960 academic year was twice that of 1955 and five times the total number of students in the entire Indochina in 1939.
    In terms of socialist transformation, as of the beginning of May 1960, more than 54% of peasant households among the working peasants had joined agricultural cooperatives, 95% of private capitalist industrial and commercial enterprises had been or were being transformed into joint state-private enterprises, and 70% of handicraft laborers had been organized, of which 47% had joined intermediate and advanced handicraft cooperatives.
    Now, the people of North Vietnam are launching a competition to overfulfill the 1960 plan in order to successfully complete the Three-Year Plan and prepare for the first Five-Year Plan.
    Striving for the Reunification of the Motherland
    While North Vietnam is steadily advancing towards a better new life, South Vietnam is groaning under the brutal rule of the American-Ngo clique.
    According to the provisions of the Geneva Accords, the 17th parallel is only a temporary military demarcation line. Temporarily dividing Vietnam into two parts is only to facilitate the realization of a ceasefire and the restoration of peace. The agreement stipulates that in July 1955, representatives from both the North and South should consult with each other in order to hold free general elections nationwide in July 1956 to unify Vietnam. The Geneva Accords also have many clauses aimed at preventing the recurrence of war, such as prohibiting the dispatch of new military personnel and weapons and ammunition into Vietnam, and prohibiting the establishment of new military bases or foreign military bases in Vietnam.
    However, due to American imperialism's interference in South Vietnam, replacing the position of the French colonists and manipulating its running dog Ngo Dinh Diem clique to sabotage the implementation of the Geneva Accords, Vietnam is still divided to this day, and peace in Indochina and Southeast Asia is facing a serious threat.
    The government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and the Vietnamese people are eager for peace and the unification of the motherland, and have always strictly respected and implemented all the clauses of the Geneva Accords, which has been confirmed by the International Commission in Vietnam in ten working reports. On the contrary, the South Vietnamese regime, the running dog of American imperialism, has rejected any reasonable proposals put forward by the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, refused to consult with North Vietnam, obstructed the normalization of relations between the North and South, and has increasingly strengthened its military forces, preparing for war and suppressing and massacring the people of South Vietnam.
    Just a few recent facts are enough to illustrate the criminal acts and shameful conspiracies of the American-Ngo clique in South Vietnam. For example, they conspired to openly increase military personnel for the "American Military Assistance Advisory Group" – an American command established in 1950, an intervention tool of American imperialism that attempted to prolong and expand the Indochina war and illegally stayed in South Vietnam after the end of the war, controlling the South Vietnamese Ministry of National Defense and directing the South Vietnamese army to suppress the people and prepare for war. Another example is their promulgation and implementation of Ordinance No. 10 of 1959, a fascist ordinance stipulating the establishment of special military tribunals with powers that violate all basic principles of jurisprudence, without conducting investigations, without allowing appeals, and sentencing those arrested to death or hard labor, with the aim of massacring former resistance personnel and patriotic and peace-loving people in South Vietnam.
    Simultaneous with these illegal activities, the American-Ngo clique is constantly expanding or building new military bases in South Vietnam, transporting American weapons, ammunition, and war equipment into South Vietnam; forcing people to concentrate in so-called "densely populated areas" in order to control the people and conscript laborers and soldiers; and constantly conducting large-scale "military sweeps," turning South Vietnam into a situation of continuous war. As a result of the American-Ngo clique's implementation of a policy of terror and revenge for six years, 230,000 people have been arrested, and more than 14,000 have been killed or gone missing, including more than 1,000 people who were poisoned and killed simultaneously in the Phu Loi concentration camp at the end of 1958.
    These actions of the American-Ngo clique seriously violate the Geneva Accords, obstruct the peaceful reunification of Vietnam, create tensions in Indochina, and turn South Vietnam into a colony, military base, and hotbed of war for American imperialism. In order to fight for the right to survival, to fight for freedom and democracy, to defend independence and peace, and to realize the reunification of the motherland, the people of South Vietnam are increasingly uniting and heroically resisting the American-Ngo clique. This struggle is necessary and completely just. The people of North Vietnam, on the one hand, are strengthening the struggle against the American-Ngo clique, demanding the strict implementation of the Geneva Accords, and fully supporting the struggle of the people of South Vietnam; on the other hand, they are more actively building socialism in North Vietnam, making North Vietnam a solid base for the struggle for the peaceful reunification of the motherland. In this way, the Vietnamese people in the North and South are continuing to dedicate all their strength to the Asian-African national independence movement, to opposing American imperialism, and to defending peace in Southeast Asia and the world.
    Full of Confidence in Victory
    The socialist construction in North Vietnam and the Vietnamese people's struggle for the reunification of the motherland still face many complex difficulties. However, the Vietnamese people are receiving the support of the people of the world, especially the fraternal socialist countries. The Chinese people and the government of the People's Republic of China have consistently and clearly expressed deep concern for the Vietnamese people, and have given the Vietnamese people full support and all-out assistance in the past war of resistance and in the current struggle and construction.
    For the Vietnamese people, this international support and the assistance of fraternal countries is very valuable. However, the Vietnamese people know that, like the past war of resistance, if they want to achieve victory, they need their own great efforts, and self-reliance is still the main thing.
    Looking back at the long and arduous revolutionary struggle process of the Vietnamese people, looking back at the great victories achieved in the past fifteen years, the Vietnamese people firmly believe that, just as the Chinese and world people will surely be able to defend peace and democracy, the Vietnamese people will achieve victory in the struggle against American imperialism and its running dogs, and will be successful in the cause of building a peaceful, unified, independent, democratic, and prosperous Vietnam. The friendship between the people of Vietnam and China will surely be increasingly consolidated and developed!

    越南民主共和国建国十五周年
    越南民主共和国副主席　孙德胜
    十五年前，1945年9月2日，胡志明主席在河内巴亭广场上宣读越南“独立宣言”，越南民主共和国随着诞生了。这是越南人民近百年来不断抵抗法国殖民者的结果，是越南劳动党的前身印度支那共产党十五年英勇奋斗和英明领导的结果，是越盟阵线武装打击法国殖民者、驱逐日本法西斯、使得“八月革命”迅速地在全国取得辉煌胜利的结果。这一胜利结束了帝国主义殖民者在越南八十多年的统治和封建帝王数千年的统治，开辟了越南民族历史上一个新的纪元。
    越南人民把政权掌握到自己手里之后，过去十五年，在保卫祖国和建设祖国的事业中，已经取得了辉煌的成就。
    抗战获得胜利
    第二次世界大战刚刚结束，我们的人民民主国家刚刚建立，越南人民和越南民主共和国政府迫切希望和平，以便医治战争创伤、建设祖国。但在越南民主共和国成立仅仅三个星期，正面临着极其严重的困难的时候，法国殖民军队在解除日本法西斯军队武装的英国军队的掩护下，立即开始进行一场侵略越南的战争。法国殖民者从越南南方逐渐扩大其侵略范围，撕毁了法国政府和越南民主共和国政府签订的、旨在维持越南和平的1946年3月6日的协定和9月14日的临时协定。1946年12月19日，全国抗战爆发。越南全国人民，响应胡志明主席的号召，一致奋起抗敌救国。
    一场极其艰苦而又无比英勇的抗战延续了八、九年之久。法国殖民者有最新式武器装备的职业军队，并且得到美帝国主义在金钱、武器和计划方面的援助，而越南人民，初期只有土枪、棍棒，可以说只有一双空手，但由于人民的紧密团结和不愿再做奴隶的决心，由于越南劳动党的英明领导，所以越南人民不断取得胜利，最后取得了1954年5月具有历史意义的奠边府战役的胜利。
    越南人民抗战的胜利以及各兄弟的社会主义国家、法国人民和世界人民要求实现印度支那和平的运动，促使日内瓦会议得以召开并得到成功，粉碎了美帝国主义拖延和扩大印度支那战争的阴谋。1954年7月20日签订的日内瓦协议，在承认越南、柬埔寨和老挝三国的独立、自主、统一和领土完整的基础上，结束了印度支那的战争。这是亚非民族独立运动和保卫世界和平斗争的伟大胜利。
    建设越南北方
    和平恢复以后，越南北方摆脱了帝国主义的桎梏，得到彻底解放，完成了民族人民民主革命，进入向社会主义过渡的时期。
    封建殖民制度和十五年的战争，使越南北方雕敝不堪。但是，由于越南人民的英勇奋斗和热情劳动，加上各兄弟的社会主义国家的无私的援助，所以仅仅在接管整个越南北方两年之后，就完成了土地改革，完成了恢复国民经济达到战前水平的任务，并开始实行旨在加强社会主义改造、初步发展经济和文化、积极为社会主义工业化作准备的1958—1960年的三年计划。
    在建设越南北方的工作中，我们所取得的成就是非常巨大的。在1955—1959的五年当中，农业方面，产量增加52.6％（如果和战前比较，按人口平均计算，稻谷收获量增加66％）。工业方面，新建了九十一项重要的国营企业，国营工业的总产值增长了十六倍，手工业和私营工业的总产值增长了65％。商业方面，商品的总零售额增加了99％，出口商品增长了八倍。在医疗卫生事业方面，医疗机构增加了一倍。文化教育方面，文盲已基本肃清，大学生增加了七倍，每年出版的书籍递增三倍，1959—1960年学年普通学校和启蒙班的学生总数是1955年的二倍，是1939年整个印度支那学生总数的五倍。
    在社会主义改造方面，截至1960年5月初，劳动农民中54％以上的农户加入了农业合作社，95％的私营资本主义工商业企业已经或正在改变为公私合营企业，70％的手工业劳动者已经组织起来，其中47％加入中级和高级手工业合作社。
    现在，越南北方人民为了胜利完成三年计划和为第一个五年计划作好准备，正在展开超额完成1960年计划的竞赛。
    为祖国的统一而斗争
    当越南北方正稳步向更美好的新生活前进的时候，越南南方却呻吟在美吴集团残暴的统治下。
    按照日内瓦协议的规定，十七度线只是临时的军事分界线。暂时把越南分作二部分，只是为了便于实现停火和恢复和平。这一协议规定，1955年7月，南北两方的代表应互相协商，以便在1956年7月在全国实行自由普选，统一越南。日内瓦协议还有许多条款，旨在防止战争再演，如不许增派新的军事人员和武器弹药进入越南，不许在越南建立新的军事基地或外国军事基地。
    但是，由于美帝国主义对越南南方的干涉，取代了法国殖民者的地位，操纵其走狗吴庭艳集团破坏日内瓦协议的执行，所以直到现在，越南仍遭到分割，印度支那和东南亚的和平正遭到严重的威胁。
    越南民主共和国政府和越南人民迫切希望和平和统一祖国，始终严格尊重和实行日内瓦协议的一切条款，这是在越南的国际委员会在十次工作报告里所确认的。相反，美帝国主义的走狗南方政权，拒绝了越南民主共和国提出的任何合情合理的建议，拒绝和越南北方协商，阻挠南北两方关系正常化，并日益加强军事力量，准备战争，镇压和残杀越南南方人民。
    只要稍举最近的一些事实，就足以说明越南南方美吴集团的罪恶行径和可耻阴谋。例如，他们阴谋公开为“美国军事援助顾问团”——1950年建立的一个企图延长和扩大印度支那战争、在战争结束后非法赖在越南南方的美帝国主义的干涉工具，控制南越国防部、指挥南越军队镇压人民和准备战争的美国司令部——增加军事人员。又如，他们公布和执行1959年第十号法令，这是一项规定设立具有违反一切基本法理原则的权力的特别军事法庭的法西斯法令，不进行调查，不许上诉，对被捕者判处死刑或苦役，其目的是为了屠杀越南南方原抗战人员和爱祖国爱和平的人民。
    在这些非法活动的同时，美吴集团不断在越南南方扩大或新建军事基地，把美国的武器弹药和战争设备运进越南南方；强迫人民集中到那些所谓“稠密区”，以便控制人民和抓夫抓兵；不断进行大规模的“军事扫荡”，使越南南方变成了战争连绵不断的局面。六年来，美吴集团实行恐怖复仇政策的结果，使二十三万人被捕，一万四千多人被杀害或失踪，其中有一千多人是1958年底在富利集中营同时被毒害和杀死的。
    美吴集团的这些行动，严重违反了日内瓦协议，阻挠越南的和平统一，造成了印度支那的紧张局势，把越南南方变成了美帝国主义的殖民地、军事基地和战争的策源地。为了争取生存权利，争取自由民主，保卫独立和和平，实现祖国的统一，越南南方人民日益团结起来，英勇反抗美吴集团。这一斗争是必要的和完全正义的。越南北方人民，一方面在加强反对美吴集团的斗争，要求严格履行日内瓦协议，完全支持越南南方人民的斗争；另一方面更加积极在越南北方建设社会主义，使越南北方变成和平统一祖国斗争的巩固基地。这样，北方和南方的越南人民，正在继续为亚非民族独立运动、为反对美帝国主义和保卫东南亚和世界和平而献出自己的全部力量。
    满怀胜利的信心
    越南北方的社会主义建设事业和越南人民统一祖国的斗争还有许多复杂的困难。但越南人民得到世界人民，特别是各兄弟的社会主义国家的支持。中国人民和中华人民共和国政府一贯明确表示深切关怀越南人民，在过去的抗战中和现在的斗争和建设事业中，给予越南人民以完全的支持和全力的帮助。
    对于越南人民，这种国际上的支持和各兄弟国家的援助是十分宝贵的。但越南人民知道，像过去的抗战一样，要想取得胜利，需要自己的巨大努力，自力更生仍是主要的。
    回顾过去越南人民长期艰苦的革命斗争过程，回顾过去十五年当中取得的巨大胜利，越南人民坚信，和中国及世界人民一定能保卫和平和民主一样，越南人民在反对美帝国主义及其走狗的斗争中将取得胜利，在建设一个和平、统一、独立、民主和富强的越南的事业中将得到成功。越中两国人民之间的友谊一定日益巩固和发展！
