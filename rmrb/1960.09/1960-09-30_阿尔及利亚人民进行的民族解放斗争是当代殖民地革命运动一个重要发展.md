Xinhua News Agency, September 29th: Premier Zhou Enlai's speech at the banquet welcoming Prime Minister Abbas. Your Excellency Respected Prime Minister Abbas Ferhat, distinguished guests of the Provisional Government Delegation of the Republic of Algeria, friends, comrades:

His Excellency Prime Minister Abbas Ferhat, the leader of the heroic Algerian people, has led the delegation of the Provisional Government of the Republic of Algeria on a long journey to visit our country, bringing the precious combat friendship of the Algerian people, the Arab people, and the African people to the Chinese people. We are very happy. On behalf of the Chinese government and the Chinese people, I extend the warmest welcome and heartfelt gratitude to His Excellency Prime Minister Abbas.

For more than a hundred years, the Algerian people have been engaged in various forms of struggle against French colonial rule and for national independence and freedom, advancing wave upon wave, fully demonstrating their heroic and unyielding revolutionary will. What we must particularly mention is that in November 1954, the Algerian people launched a national armed uprising against the armed suppression of the French colonialists. This was an important turning point for the Algerian national liberation movement. Since that time, the Algerian people and the National Liberation Army have continuously achieved victories and have constantly strengthened their own forces in the struggle. Despite the various barbaric armed suppressions and cunning political deceptions adopted by the French colonialists, they cannot save the failure of their colonial rule. The establishment of the Provisional Government of the Republic of Algeria headed by Prime Minister Abbas on September 19, 1958, marked a new stage in the Algerian people's national liberation struggle. We are pleased to see that the Algerian National Liberation Army has liberated vast areas accounting for more than half of Algeria's population, and has established its own political organizations in these areas. This is a great victory for the just struggle of the Algerian people. This tremendous change in Algeria once again proves that the situation where the enemy is strong and we are weak is only temporary, and it will change in the opposite direction. Because imperialism, which represents the forces of decay, may appear strong, but is actually weak. Their temporary rampage is nothing more than a dying struggle. What is truly powerful and invincible is by no means the decadent imperialism, but the awakened, united, and fighting Algerian people. We firmly believe that as long as they continue to persevere in their struggle, the Algerian people will surely achieve final victory. At present, the Provisional Government of the Republic of Algeria, headed by His Excellency Prime Minister Abbas, is leading the Algerian people to overcome all difficulties, persist in and develop the national liberation struggle, and bravely advance towards the goal of completely and thoroughly liberating their homeland. The Chinese people express their utmost admiration for the heroic struggle of the Algerian people and sincerely congratulate you on moving from victory to greater victory!

The national liberation struggle waged by the Algerian people is an important development in the contemporary colonial revolutionary movement. Its significance and influence have far surpassed the scope of Algeria alone. The shining example of the Algerian people's persistence in struggle and heroic fighting has not only greatly inspired the people of Africa, Asia, and Latin America who are striving for national liberation, but also directly and powerfully supported the struggle of the people of the African continent against imperialism and for national independence, and is conducive to world peace, because the Algerian people and the National Liberation Army have continuously depleted and contained the main forces of the French colonial army. Now, the raging flames of the national independence movement have spread throughout the African continent, and the so-called "Dark Continent" has dawned. By October of this year, African people who account for about three-quarters of the total African population on two-thirds of African land will gain independence or preliminary independence. They are bravely struggling to further get rid of the political, economic, and military control of imperialism. The tenacious struggles of the people of African countries that have not yet achieved independence to achieve national independence have formed an irresistible torrent. The relationship of mutual assistance and unity established by the African people in the common struggle against colonialism is also constantly strengthening and developing. The colonial system of imperialism on the African continent is facing a comprehensive collapse and disintegration. It can be asserted that the great struggle of the African people for national independence cannot be stopped by any force, and the day is not far off when they will once again become masters of their own land.

Friends, comrades, the current development of the international situation is increasingly favorable to the struggle of the people of all countries in the world for peace, democracy, national liberation, and socialism, and increasingly unfavorable to the imperialist group headed by the United States. However, imperialism will never abandon its policies of aggression and war because of its difficult situation. Now, while persisting in policies of suppression and massacre, those old-line colonialist countries are also compelled by the situation to take certain formal concessions to maintain their actual colonial interests, while US imperialism is trying its best to undermine and interfere with the national independence movement, and is attempting to replace the old-line colonialists and reimpose new colonial shackles on the African people. Eisenhower recently talked a lot about establishing a so-called "United Nations system" in the Congo and Africa at the 15th UN General Assembly. Its essence is to use the United Nations as a tool to realize the US imperialist's grand conspiracy plan to replace the old-line colonialism and carry out comprehensive aggression and control of Africa. This cannot be concealed by any sweet talk. However, what is particularly worthy of people's vigilance is that US imperialism has been supporting French imperialism's armed suppression and political conspiracies against the Algerian people, and supporting the colonial authorities of the Union of South Africa in pursuing a barbaric policy of racial discrimination. Recently, US imperialism has even used the United Nations to rudely interfere in the internal affairs of the Congo, openly carrying out activities to split the Congo and subvert the legitimate government of the Congo. US imperialism is conspiring to use Congolese to fight Congolese, and Africans to fight Africans, creating division in the Congo and Africa, in order to realize its ambition to swallow the Congo and the entire Africa. At the same time, US imperialism is also plotting subversion and interference in Laos in Asia, and carrying out subversion and interference in Cuba in Latin America. More and more facts make the people of the world increasingly aware that US imperialism is the most dangerous enemy of the people of Africa, Asia, and Latin America, and the main enemy of the cause of world peace. The people of the world must unite and wage a resolute struggle against US imperialism and its followers.

The Chinese people love peace and have always advocated friendly cooperation with all countries on the basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. The Chinese people have always spared no effort to strengthen the unity of the socialist camp, strengthen the unity of the people of Asian, African, and Latin American countries, strengthen the unity of all peace-loving countries and people in the world, and wage unremitting efforts to oppose the aggressive and war policies of US imperialism and defend world peace. The Chinese government has developed friendly and cooperative relations with many Asian and African countries in accordance with the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, and has signed treaties of friendship and non-aggression or treaties of peace and friendship with a series of friendly Asian and African countries. Recently, the Treaty of Friendship we signed with the Republic of Guinea marks a new stage in the friendly and cooperative relations between our country and African countries. We believe that the fighting friendship between the Chinese people and the African people in the common struggle against imperialism and for the defense of world peace will be further developed.

Your Excellency Respected Prime Minister, the Chinese people have always deeply sympathized with and enthusiastically supported the national liberation struggle of the Algerian people. In order to support the national liberation struggle of the Algerian people, we are willing to do everything we can. We have been, are, and will be like this in the future. His Excellency Prime Minister Abbas and the Algerian people can rest assured that the Chinese people will always stand with the Algerian people, and the Chinese people will always be the most reliable friends of the Algerian people! In recent years, especially since the establishment of the Provisional Government of the Republic of Algeria, the friendly relations between our two countries have been continuously developing. During this period, we have received various delegations from your country many times. We firmly believe that this visit to our country by His Excellency Prime Minister Abbas and the delegation of the Provisional Government of the Republic of Algeria will further consolidate and develop the friendly and cooperative relations between our two countries, and will be conducive to enhancing Asian-African solidarity and safeguarding world peace. The struggle of the Algerian people is by no means isolated. Those who oppose you are only a handful of imperialists and their lackeys, but hundreds of millions of Arab people, Asian and African people, the people of socialist countries, and all peace-loving and justice-upholding people in the world firmly stand by your side. The Chinese people firmly believe that relying on the Algerian people's own increasing unity and unremitting long-term struggle, the Algerian people will surely finally defeat imperialism and win their own independence and freedom!

Finally, I propose a toast:

To the friendship between the Chinese and Algerian people!
To the victory of the Algerian national liberation struggle!
To the victory of the national independence movements in Asia, Africa, and Latin America!
To Asian-African solidarity and world peace!
To the health of His Excellency Prime Minister Abbas and all the distinguished Algerian guests!
Cheers!

    周恩来总理在欢迎阿巴斯总理的宴会上说
    阿尔及利亚人民进行的民族解放斗争是当代殖民地革命运动一个重要发展
    艾森豪威尔最近在十五届联大会上大谈其在刚果和非洲建立所谓“联合国制度”，它的实质就是利用联合国为工具，实现美帝国主义取代老牌殖民主义而进行全面侵略和控制非洲的大阴谋计划。
    新华社29日讯　周恩来总理在招待阿巴斯总理宴会上的讲话。尊敬的阿巴斯·费尔哈特总理阁下，尊敬的阿尔及利亚共和国临时政府代表团的全体贵宾们，朋友们，同志们：
    英勇的阿尔及利亚人民的领导者阿巴斯·费尔哈特总理阁下率领阿尔及利亚共和国临时政府代表团远道前来我国访问，带来了阿尔及利亚人民、阿拉伯人民和非洲人民对中国人民的珍贵的战斗友情，我们感到十分高兴。我代表中国政府和中国人民对阿巴斯总理阁下表示最热烈的欢迎和衷心的谢意。
    一百多年以来，阿尔及利亚人民为反抗法国的殖民统治，争取民族的独立和自由，一直进行着各种形式的斗争，前仆后继，此起彼伏，充分表现了英勇不屈的革命意志。特别值得我们提到的是，1954年11月，阿尔及利亚人民为反对法国殖民主义者的武装镇压举行了全民武装起义。这是阿尔及利亚民族解放斗争历史的一个重要转折点。从那个时候以来，阿尔及利亚人民和民族解放军就不断获得胜利，并且在斗争中不断壮大自己的力量。尽管法国殖民主义者采取各种野蛮的武装镇压和狡猾的政治欺骗，都不能挽救它的殖民统治的失败。1958年9月19日以阿巴斯总理为首的阿尔及利亚共和国临时政府的成立，更标志着阿尔及利亚人民的民族解放斗争进入一个新的阶段。我们高兴地看到，阿尔及利亚民族解放军已经解放了占阿尔及利亚人口半数以上的广大地区，并且在这些地区建立了自己的政权组织。这是阿尔及利亚人民正义斗争的伟大胜利。阿尔及利亚的这个巨大变化又一次证明，敌强我弱的形势只是暂时的，它将会朝着相反的方向转变。因为，代表腐朽势力的帝国主义虽貌似强大，而实际上是虚弱的。他们一时的猖獗，不过是垂死的挣扎。真正有力量的和不可战胜的，绝不是腐朽的帝国主义，而是觉醒了的、团结起来的、战斗的阿尔及利亚人民。我们深信，只要继续坚持斗争，阿尔及利亚人民必将取得最后的胜利。现在，以阿巴斯总理阁下为首的阿尔及利亚共和国临时政府，正在领导阿尔及利亚人民，排除一切困难，坚持和发展民族解放斗争，朝着全部、彻底解放自己国土的目标奋勇前进。中国人民对阿尔及利亚人民的英勇斗争，表示极大的钦佩，并且衷心祝贺你们从胜利走向更大的胜利！
    阿尔及利亚人民所进行的民族解放斗争，是当代殖民地革命运动的一个重要发展。它的意义和影响，已经远远超越了阿尔及利亚一国的范围。阿尔及利亚人民坚持斗争、英勇奋战的光辉范例，不仅给予非洲、亚洲和拉丁美洲争取民族解放的各国人民以极大的鼓舞，而且由于阿尔及利亚人民和民族解放军使法国殖民军队的主力受到了不断的消耗和牵制，从而直接有力地支持了非洲大陆人民反对帝国主义和争取民族独立的斗争，有利于世界和平。现在，民族独立运动的熊熊烽火已经燃遍了整个非洲大陆，所谓“黑暗大陆”已经破晓。到今年10月，在三分之二的非洲土地上，占全非人口约四分之三的非洲人民将获得独立或者初步独立。他们正在为进一步摆脱帝国主义的政治、经济和军事的控制而英勇斗争。尚未取得独立的非洲各国人民为争取实现民族独立而进行的顽强斗争，已经形成一股不可抗拒的洪流。非洲人民在反对殖民主义的共同斗争中建立起来的互助团结关系也在不断加强和发展。帝国主义在非洲大陆的殖民体系正面临着全面的崩溃和瓦解。可以断言，伟大的非洲人民争取民族独立的斗争，是任何力量所不能阻挡的，他们重新成为自己土地上的主人的日子已经不远了。
    朋友们，同志们，当前国际形势的发展越来越有利于世界各国人民争取和平、民主、民族解放和社会主义的斗争，而越来越不利于以美国为首的帝国主义集团。但是，帝国主义决不会因为它们处境困难而放弃侵略政策和战争政策。现在，那些老牌殖民主义国家在坚持镇压和屠杀政策的同时，也迫于形势而采取某些形式上的让步，来保持它们的实际上的殖民利益，而美帝国主义又在竭力破坏和干涉民族独立运动，并且企图取老牌殖民主义者而代之，把新的殖民主义枷锁重新套在非洲人民的头上。艾森豪威尔最近在十五届联大会上大谈其在刚果和非洲建立所谓“联合国制度”，它的实质就是利用联合国为工具，实现美帝国主义取代老牌殖民主义而进行全面侵略和控制非洲的大阴谋计划。这是一切甜言蜜语所掩盖不了的。但是，特别值得人们警惕的是，美帝国主义一直在支持法帝国主义对阿尔及利亚人民进行武装镇压和政治阴谋，支持南非联邦殖民当局推行野蛮的种族歧视政策。最近，美帝国主义更利用联合国横蛮地干涉刚果的内政，公然进行分裂刚果和颠复刚果的合法政府的活动。美帝国主义阴谋用刚果人打刚果人、用非洲人打非洲人，制造刚果和非洲的分裂，以实现其鲸吞刚果和整个非洲的野心。与此同时，美帝国主义还在亚洲策划对老挝的颠复和干涉，在拉丁美洲进行对古巴的颠复和干涉。越来越多的事实，使世界人民日益清楚地认识到，美帝国主义是非洲、亚洲和拉丁美洲人民的最危险的敌人，是世界和平事业的最主要敌人。世界人民必须团结起来，同美帝国主义及其追随者进行坚决的斗争。
    中国人民热爱和平，一贯主张在和平共处五项原则的基础上同各国友好合作。中国人民始终不遗余力地为加强社会主义阵营各国的团结，加强亚、非和拉丁美洲各国人民的团结，加强世界一切爱好和平国家和人民的团结，为反对美帝国主义的侵略政策和战争政策，保卫世界和平而进行坚持不懈的努力。中国政府根据和平共处五项原则同许多亚非国家发展了友好合作的关系，并且同一系列友好的亚非国家签订了友好和互不侵犯条约或者和平友好条约。最近，我们同几内亚共和国签订的友好条约，标志着我国同非洲国家的友好合作关系已经进入了一个新的阶段。我们相信，中国人民同非洲人民在反对帝国主义、保卫世界和平的共同斗争中所结成的战斗友谊必将得到进一步的发展。
    尊敬的总理阁下，中国人民一向深切地同情和热烈地支持阿尔及利亚人民的民族解放斗争，为了支持阿尔及利亚人民的民族解放斗争，我们愿意尽力做我们能做的一切。我们过去、现在和将来，都是这样。阿巴斯总理阁下和阿尔及利亚人民可以相信，中国人民将永远同阿尔及利亚人民站在一道，中国人民永远是阿尔及利亚人民最可靠的朋友！几年来，特别是阿尔及利亚共和国临时政府成立以来，我们两国的友好关系一直在不断发展。在此期间，我们曾多次接待过来自你们国家的各种代表团，我们深信，阿巴斯总理阁下和他所率领的阿尔及利亚共和国临时政府代表团这一次来我国访问，必将进一步巩固和发展我们两国之间的友好合作关系，并且将有利于增进亚非团结和维护世界和平的事业。阿尔及利亚人民的斗争决不是孤立的，反对你们的只不过是一小撮帝国主义分子及其走卒，坚决站在你们一边的却是亿万阿拉伯人民、亚非人民、社会主义国家的人民、和全世界一切爱好和平和主持正义的人民。中国人民坚信，依靠阿尔及利亚人民自己日益增强的团结和坚持不懈的长期斗争，阿尔及利亚人民一定能够最后战胜帝国主义，赢得自己的独立和自由！
    最后，我提议
    为中、阿两国人民的友谊，
    为阿尔及利亚民族解放斗争的胜利，
    为亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲民族独立运动的胜利，
    为亚非团结和世界和平，
    为阿巴斯总理阁下和阿尔及利亚全体贵宾们的健康，
    干杯！
