　　Inheriting and Developing the Fine Traditions of Folk New Year Pictures
　　——Some Experiences in Creating Woodblock New Year Pictures
　　Xie Changyi
　　Shandong folk woodblock New Year pictures are one of China's rich folk art heritages. In the past, there were more than 40 New Year picture production areas, among which the Yangjiabu area of Weifang City (formerly Weixian County), known as one of the three major New Year picture production areas in China, began producing New Year pictures as early as the late Ming and early Qing dynasties. The annual circulation of New Year pictures reached tens of millions, sold throughout more than 20 counties in Shandong, and also sold to Henan, Anhui, Shanxi, the Northeast and other places, deeply loved by the people, especially the vast number of farmers.
　　However, because folk New Year pictures were produced and circulated in the old society, while reflecting the working people's yearning for a better life, they inevitably contained a lot of feudal, superstitious and bourgeois ideas. In order to inherit and develop this folk art form with a wide mass base, and make it a weapon to educate and encourage the people, it is necessary to reform, create and develop it. Only in this way can it better serve the masses. The Party attaches great importance to folk New Year pictures. Over the past ten years, the Shandong Provincial Bureau of Culture and the Shandong Provincial Federation of Literary and Art Circles have successively organized five New Year picture work teams (groups) to go deep into the Yangjiabu area of Weifang City to create New Year pictures, using new New Year pictures with proletarian ideas to replace those backward and even poisonous old works. As a art worker, I also participated in the most recent New Year picture creation, and here I will only talk about some personal experiences.
　　In order to create new works that are both topical in content and retain the characteristics of folk New Year pictures in expression, it is necessary to first study and research the old New Year pictures. When Shandong Province was carrying out the creation of New Year pictures as a tribute to the 10th anniversary of the founding of the country, the Propaganda Department of the Provincial Party Committee also clearly instructed that the content should reflect the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Commune movement, but the form should maintain the inherent style of folk New Year pictures. Therefore, we started by exploring the traditional characteristics of old New Year pictures.
　　The creators and appreciators of Shandong folk woodblock New Year pictures are mainly farmers. The creators are direct participants in agricultural production, and New Year pictures are only made as a sideline during the slack season. Therefore, the content of these New Year pictures mostly reflects the wishes and demands of farmers for life, and the forms all have strong folk characteristics, a style that is easy to understand, healthy and simple, and unique traditional characteristics. Its formal style is different from New Year pictures in other parts of China, for example, it has significant differences from the famous Tianjin Yangliuqing New Year pictures. Yangliuqing New Year pictures mostly use bird's-eye view composition, with large space, multiple levels, large scenes, and many characters; the modeling is relatively realistic, and generally painted delicately and elegantly; the colors are rich and harmonious. While Shandong woodblock New Year pictures mostly use generalization and symbolism in their expression. The composition is generally more complete, full, and symmetrical, and there is not much space on the screen; the decoration is strong; the colors are bright, strong, and have a pattern effect.
　　Another characteristic of Shandong folk woodblock New Year pictures is the diversification of forms and the close connection with people's lives. It beautifies and decorates every corner of farmers' houses through various forms. From the gate of the house to the shadow wall in the yard; from the door to the kang head, the two sides of the window and the top of the window; as well as tables, walls, wall holes, stoves, livestock sheds, and even ox carts, there are corresponding forms of New Year pictures to decorate it. New Year pictures are not only paintings for people to appreciate, but also decorative pictures that beautify the lives of the masses every year.
　　According to the requirements of the new subject content, and with reference to the traditional characteristics of folk New Year pictures and the masses' appreciation habits, we determined the forms of expression of the new content. For example, for "Gate Paintings," we painted "Dragon and Phoenix Auspiciousness" with abundant steel, coal, grain, and cotton; "Four-Panel Screens" used to depict beautiful women, but we painted "Eight Female Members of the People's Commune"; the large New Year pictures are suitable for expressing large mass scenes, so we painted "Comforting the Elderly Home"; the four-open New Year pictures used to depict baby themes a lot, so we painted "Five Routes to Wealth" and "The Reservoir is Good"; the eight-open New Year pictures are a combination of poetry and painting in folk New Year pictures, so we painted "Good Sister-in-law", "Golden Rooster Crows at Dawn" and so on based on Shandong new folk songs. In terms of expressive techniques, we also focused on learning and absorbing the strengths of folk New Year pictures, such as not being a naturalistic description of objects, and not superficially and diagrammatically explaining things when expressing things, but rather selecting the internal factors of things, and fully expressing them through generalization, symbolism, and romanticism. Taking Lu Xueqin's "Five Routes to Wealth" as an example, when he started to deal with this subject, he only diagrammed the content on the surface, and drew "five routes" of trains, cars, airplanes, etc. fully loaded with agricultural and sideline products. As a result, the composition was very scattered, and it could not express the spiritual outlook of people and concentrate on expressing the five routes of wealth of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline and fishery of the People's Commune. Later, after learning and absorbing the symbolic techniques of folk New Year pictures, he used five children with different identities holding agricultural and sideline products to express it. As a result, it was very effective. Not only were the characters distinct and prominent, but there was also an atmosphere of harvest. He also learned and used the language of folk art in the depiction of images in the painting. Among them, there is a child holding a big peach and teasing a big fish to walk forward. This plot easily reminds us of "Two Dragons Playing with a Pearl" and "Lion Dance" in folk art. The arrangement of this plot adds a lively atmosphere to the picture. These are the results of learning from folk art. Another example is Shi Banghua's "Golden Rooster Crows at Dawn," which was also inspired by folk New Year pictures. In the handling of this painting, he did not diagram the content of the poem, but prominently drew a crowing rooster in front of the picture. From near to far, a newly opened channel extends from the rooster's side. Some workers' tents are drawn on both sides of the channel, and the red sun rises behind the distant mountains. Through the rooster symbolizing auspiciousness and the rising sun symbolizing the People's Commune, it sings the praises of the feats of the working people in controlling mountains and rivers after the communization.
　　In short, through learning from folk New Year pictures, we have realized that learning from tradition should not only superficially learn its lines and colors, or paint people's eyes with decorative grasshopper eyes, and think that it has a folk flavor. More importantly, it is to learn how to carry out the expressive methods of artistic generalization.
　　Learning from tradition must also be analytical and critical. The era reflected in folk New Year pictures is very far from today's real life. Some of the expressive techniques are not suitable for expressing our new things today. For example, in some new New Year pictures, in order to learn the decoration of folk New Year pictures, the ornaments and hairstyles worn by children in the Qing Dynasty are moved to the children in our paintings today, which makes our creations lose their sense of the times. Therefore, as a creator, in addition to learning from folk New Year pictures and mastering its creative rules and methods, it is more important to improve the ideological and artistic level of folk New Year pictures, and improve its ability to express new things, so that it can more widely reflect our era and better serve socialist construction. We are against mechanically copying, and we also disagree with not improving and upgrading the tradition. But the improvement of any art should not be separated from its inherent characteristics, and should be improved on the basis of the original folk traditions. The style of folk New Year pictures is very high, but there are still certain limitations in the methods of expression. In the process of creation, we have made some improvements in view of its limitations, expanded the scope of expression of certain forms, enriched its expressive techniques, and overcome some difficulties in its production. For example, in the past, New Year pictures could only express children's themes. We have expanded its scope of expression. Folk New Year pictures have relatively simple lines with few changes. We have increased the thickness changes of the lines. In terms of decoration, we also try our best to make it decorative, with both changes and characteristics of the times. In terms of rubbing and printing, the past watermarks could not print large areas of color. We experimented with mixing dry oil into the color to overcome the uneven phenomenon of printing large color blocks in the past, and so on. The process of improvement is a process of re-creation. This task is very arduous. We have only just started, and further research is needed.
　　In the process of learning from folk New Year pictures, we deeply realized the richness and preciousness of folk art heritage. There are many things in folk New Year pictures that are worth learning for our new New Year picture creators. Learning from folk New Year pictures can not only enrich the expression methods and forms of new New Year pictures, but more importantly, it helps to create new New Year pictures with a more national style.

　　继承和发扬民间年画的优良传统
　　——创作木版年画的一些体会
　　谢昌一
    山东民间木版年画是我国丰富的民间艺术遗产之一。过去年画的产地共有四十多处，其中号称我国年画三大主要产地之一的潍坊市（原潍县）杨家埠地区，远在明末清初就开始了年画的制作。每年年画的发行量达几千万份，遍销山东二十余县，并远销河南、安徽、山西、东北等地，深为人民群众特别是广大农民所喜爱。
    但是，由于民间年画产生和流传在旧社会，所以在反映劳动人民对美好生活向往的同时，不可避免地也夹杂着不少封建、迷信和资产阶级思想。为了继承和发展这一具有广泛群众性的民间艺术形式，使它成为教育人民、鼓舞人民的武器，就必须进行革新，进行创造和发展，只有如此才能更好地为群众服务。党对民间年画是十分重视的，十年来，山东省文化局和山东省文联曾先后组织了五次年画工作队（组），深入潍坊市杨家埠地区进行年画创作。用具有无产阶级思想的新年画，来代替那些落后的、甚至含有毒素的旧作品。我作为一个美术工作者，也参加了最近一次的年画创作，这里只谈谈一些点滴的体会。
    为了要创作出在内容上具有时代气息，在表现上又不失民间年画的特点的新作品，首先对于旧年画要进行学习和研究。山东省在进行向建国十周年献礼的年画创作时，省委宣传部也明确指示：在内容上要反映总路线、大跃进、人民公社化运动，但在形式上要保持民间年画的固有风格。所以我们一开始就对旧年画的传统特征进行了探讨。
    山东民间木版年画的创作者和欣赏者主要都是农民。创作者是农业生产的直接参加者，年画只是作为农闲时的副业而制作。因此，这些年画的内容多是反映农民的愿望和对生活的要求，在形式上都具有浓郁的民间特色，和通俗易懂、健康朴素的风格，以及独自的传统特征，其形式风格和我国其它地区的年画是不相同的，例如与著名的天津杨柳青年画就有着显著的区别。杨柳青年画多鸟瞰式的构图，空间大、层次多，场面大、人物多；造型比较写实，一般都画得细腻雅致；色彩丰富、调和。而山东木版年画的表现方法多具概括性和象征性，构图一般都比较完整、饱满、对称，画面上没有很大空间；装饰性强；色彩鲜艳、强烈、具有图案效果。
    山东民间木版年画的另一特点是形式多样化，和人民的生活有着密切的联系。它通过各种形式来美化和装饰农民房屋的各个角落。从房屋的大门起，到院子里的影壁墙；从房门到炕头，窗户的两旁和窗顶；以及桌子、墙壁、墙洞、灶头、牲口棚，甚至牛车等处，都有相应形式的年画来装饰它。年画既是供人欣赏的绘画作品，同时也是一年一度美化群众生活的装饰图画。
    我们根据新的题材内容的要求，参照了民间年画传统的特征和群众的欣赏习惯，确定了新内容的表现形式。如：“大门画”，我们画了钢煤粮棉丰收的《龙凤呈祥》；“四条屏”过去有画大美人的，我们画了《人民公社妇女八员》；对开的大幅年画适合表现大的群众场面，我们画了《慰问敬老院》；四开年画过去表现娃娃题材很多，我们则画了《五路进财》《水库好》；八开年画在民间年画中是诗画结合的，我们依据山东新民歌画了《好嫂嫂》、《金鸡报晓》等等。在表现手法上，我们也着重学习和吸取了民间年画的长处，如不是自然主义的描写对象，在表现事物时不表面地、图解式地去说明事物，而是拮取事物中的内在因素，通过概括、象征、浪漫主义的手法加以充分地表现等等。以吕学勤同志画的《五路进财》为例来看，开始他处理这个题材时，只是从表面上去图解内容，画中画了火车、汽车、飞机等满装着农副产品的“五路”。结果构图很分散，不能表现人的精神面貌和集中表现人民公社农、林、牧、副、渔的五路财富。后来学习和吸取了民间年画的象征手法，运用五种不同身份的儿童拿着农副产品来表现，结果收效很好，不仅人物鲜明突出，而且还有丰收的气氛。在画中形象的刻划上也学习和使用了民间艺术的语言。其中有个手里抱着大桃子的儿童，逗着一条大鱼往前行走，这个情节很容易使我们想到民间艺术中的《二龙戏珠》和《舞狮》。由于这个情节的安排，增加了画面生动活泼的气氛。这些都是向民间艺术学习的成果。又如施邦华画的《金鸡报晓》，也是受了民间年画的启发而创作的。这张画在处理上并没有图解诗的内容，只是突出地在画面前面画了只报晓的公鸡，鸡身边从近往远伸展出一条刚开辟的渠道，渠道两旁画了些民工的帐篷，远山后升起了红太阳。通过象征吉祥的公鸡，和象征人民公社的初升太阳，歌颂了公社化后劳动人民治山治水的壮举。
    总之，通过向民间年画的学习，使我们体会到，向传统学习，不应该只表面地学一学它的线条和色彩，或者是把人的眼睛都画了带有装饰性的蚂蚱眼，就认为有了民间味了，更重要的是学习它如何进行艺术概括的表现方法。
    向传统学习还必须有分析、有批判地学习。民间年画中所反映的时代，离开今天的现实生活是有很大距离的，其中有些表现手法，拿来表现我们今天的新事物是不适用的。例如在有些新年画中，为了学习民间年画的装饰性，把清代儿童身上挂的饰品和发式搬到我们今天画中的儿童身上，这样就使我们的创作失掉了时代感。因此，作为一个创作者来说，除了向民间年画学习，掌握它的创作规律和创作方法外，更重要的还是要提高民间年画的思想、艺术水平，提高它对新事物的表现能力，使它更广泛地反映我们这个时代，更好地为社会主义建设服务。我们既反对生搬硬套的作法，也不同意对传统不加以改进和提高。但任何艺术的提高总不应该离开它固有的特点，应该在原有的民间传统的基础上提高。民间年画的格调是很高的，但是在表现方法上还存在着一定局限性。我们在创作过程中就针对着它的局限性进行一些提高，扩大某些形式的表现范围，丰富它的表现手法，克服它在制作上的某些困难。例如过去只能表现儿童题材形式的年画，我们扩大它的表现范围；民间年画在线条上较单纯、变化少，我们则增加了线条的粗细变化；在装饰方面也尽力使它装饰性强，既有变化、又有时代特征；在拓印方面，过去水印不能印大片颜色，我们试验把干油掺进颜色中去，克服了过去印大色块不均匀的现象等等。提高的过程是一个再创造的过程，这个任务很艰巨，我们只仅仅开了个头，还有待进一步研究。
    在向民间年画的学习过程中，使我们深深体会到民间艺术遗产的丰富和宝贵，民间年画中有很多值得我们新年画作者学习的地方。向民间年画学习，不但可以丰富新年画的表现方法和表现形式，更重要的是有助于创作出更具有民族风格的新年画。
