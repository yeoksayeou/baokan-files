    Tangshan Mine Simple Coal Washing Plant Continuously Carries Out Technical Transformation, Exceeding the Designed Capacity of Clean Coal Production by Nearly Half

　　Fushun's Two Coal Preparation Plants
    (Our report from Shenyang, September 23) The two coal preparation plants of Fushun's Laohutai Mine and Longfeng Mine have launched a grand competition of "comparing who delivers more clean coal to steel enterprises, comparing who processes better quality clean coal, and comparing who loses less raw coal during processing," supplying more and better coking coal for the steel industry.
    In the "three comparisons" competition centered on increasing clean coal recovery rate, reducing clean coal ash content, and reducing raw coal processing loss rate, the two coal preparation plants first focused on improving equipment utilization as an important link to increase the amount of raw coal washed. For example, the repair workers of Laohutai Mine's coal preparation plant promoted the "fast inspection and fast repair" experience, and the operating workers launched a competition of "comparing who takes better care of mechanical equipment." In the first half of September, the washing machines operated two hours longer each day than in the past, greatly increasing the amount of clean coal washed.
    At the same time, both plants tried every means to improve the recovery rate of clean coal and make full use of coal resources. The workers of Laohutai Mine's coal preparation plant adopted the method of spreading a "dense net" and setting up a "recovery array," setting up five "recovery checkpoints" from the coal washing tanks and sewage ditches in the plant to the sedimentation tanks outside the plant. The mesh size of each checkpoint's screen was smaller than the previous one, and they could recover more than 40 tons of No. 2 clean coal from the coal washing water in a single day. The workers of this coal preparation plant also added a coal washing tank to the upper part of the last coal washing machine to "sift" the washed gangue coal again, which not only ensured the quality of the clean coal but also improved the recovery rate. In the first half of September, for every 100 tons of raw coal washed, the plant could process more than 70 tons of clean coal, an increase of more than 2.8% compared to the average level from January to August this year. To catch up with and surpass Laohutai Mine's coal preparation plant, the workers of Longfeng Mine's coal preparation plant sent representatives to Laohutai Mine's coal preparation plant to visit. After returning to the plant, they used scrap materials to make two tipper trucks, which could also recover more than 50 tons of No. 2 clean coal from the coal slurry every day. In the first half of September, the clean coal recovery rate of the whole plant increased by 0.7% compared to the average level of the first eight months of this year.
    The higher the output, the more important it is to improve quality. During the competition, Jian Baoquan, the Party General Branch Secretary of Longfeng Mine's coal preparation plant, found that some shifts had high ash content and some shifts had low ash content. He went to advanced shifts to summarize experience and to backward shifts to find out the reasons. Then, he mobilized the workers of the whole plant to hold a "Zhuge Liang meeting" to promote the practice of Liu Chunxi's shift, which frequently exchanged operating experience and carried out technical performance competitions between small teams. He also helped Yu Liancheng's shift, which had high ash content, surpass Liu Chunxi's shift, promoting the overall improvement of clean coal quality in the whole plant. In early September, the ash content of clean coal in the whole plant decreased by 0.37% compared to late August. Laohutai Mine's coal preparation plant, due to its adherence to the inspection system of "taking a sample every fifteen minutes" and "burning ash once every half an hour" (to see how much ash there is) to improve operations in a timely manner, also reduced the ash content of clean coal by 0.03% in early September compared to late August.
    Through the "three comparisons" competition, the average daily shipment of high-quality coking coal to enterprises such as Anshan Iron and Steel from these two coal preparation plants in the first half of September has increased significantly compared to August.

　　Wangfenggang Coal Preparation Plant
    (Our report from Hefei, September 23) Huainan Wangfenggang Coal Preparation Plant has vigorously improved equipment utilization and clean coal recovery rate, ensuring that it overfulfills the state production plan every month. From January to August this year, the amount of coal washed by this plant exceeded the original design capacity by 1.3 times. The quality of clean coal has reached the national standards every month. In early September, the daily output level increased by 5.8% compared to January to August.
    Since the beginning of this year, this plant has carried out various forms of red flag competitions, such as safety production chart competitions and competition between rivals, strengthened the post responsibility system, and workers have been diligent in measuring (machine temperature), listening (to operating sounds), checking, and lubricating, ensuring that mechanical equipment operates normally at all times. They have also taken measures such as reforming equipment to improve equipment utilization. For example, the original bucket elevator's entire heavy load was pressed on the driving shaft's round wheel, the stress surface was small, and the round wheel was easily worn. It generally needed to be replaced every six months, requiring 32 hours of shutdown. Now, they have added two hexagonal wheels to both sides of the round wheel to increase the stress surface and reduce wear, extending the service life of the round wheel by more than three times. In order to strengthen routine equipment maintenance and repair work, this plant insists on carrying out a safety activity day every week, summarizing and checking the safety production situation for the week, and solving problems in a timely manner. This plant has also formulated more than ten effective machine maintenance systems, so that each piece of equipment has a dedicated person responsible for maintenance. On the basis of strengthening routine maintenance, this plant has changed the original two-shift production, one-shift maintenance system to three-shift production with regular maintenance (twice a week). Due to the above measures, the operating time of machinery and equipment is often maintained at more than 20 hours, and in September it has increased to 20.93 hours, with daily production time exceeding the plan by one-sixth.
    In order to make the machine give full play to its role during operation time, this plant actively strengthens cooperation with railways and coal mines to ensure the timely supply of raw coal needed for production and to transport the selected clean coal out in a timely manner, avoiding situations where production is affected due to insufficient raw coal or clean coal not being transported out. They jointly formulate two transportation plans with railways and coal mines every day, rationally organize forces, and quickly load and unload.
    Wangfenggang Coal Preparation Plant has also tried every means to improve the recovery rate of clean coal. They take the middlings coal, which was originally used as civil coal, and wash it again in the lump coal washing machine; they slightly change the layout of the coal slurry water pipeline, and sprinkle water and screen the slurry coal used as power coal to select clean coal with larger particle sizes. The above two improvements alone have increased the recovery rate of clean coal by about 6%.

　　Tangshan Mine Coal Washing Plant
    (Xinhua News Agency, Tangshan, September 23) The staff and workers of Kailuan Tangshan Mine Coal Washing Plant are constantly carrying out technical transformations and improving their technical level. The production outlook is changing with each passing day, becoming a red flag for high output and high quality among simple coal washing plants nationwide. Although the number of production personnel in the plant decreased by more than 300 in August, the output of clean coal increased greatly, exceeding the designed capacity by 48%; the recovery rate of clean coal has reached more than 57%, and the ash content of clean coal also meets the standards stipulated by the state. In the first half of September, the average daily output of clean coal in the plant increased by 13.99% compared to the second half of August.
    Tangshan Mine Coal Washing Plant is a relatively large simple coal washing plant that was put into production in October last year. More than 90% of the plant's employees are young apprentices. Because the factory Party organization adheres to putting politics in command, it has enabled the staff and workers to establish the ambition to quickly master production technology, produce more and better clean coal, and support steel production. Therefore, a mass movement to vigorously overcome the technical barriers to production has been rapidly launched throughout the plant. This year, the staff and workers of the whole plant have carried out a series of technical transformations to the entire production process from coal washing, dewatering, transportation to coal slurry treatment, so that the hourly output of each main washing machine has increased by more than 70% compared to the original, the capacity of the dewatering screen has increased by nearly doubled, and the transportation capacity has increased by about doubled. With the help of universities and scientific research departments, they also successfully created a device for recovering coal slurry, which improved the recovery rate of coal slurry, not only saving 300 coal mining workers, but also recovering more than 500 tons of clean coal from the coal slurry every day.
    While carrying out technical transformation of production, the workers launched a pacesetter selection competition centered on learning and improving operational skills. They adopted various forms such as master teaching apprentices, skilled workers teaching novices, and technical performance competitions, enabling most apprentices to master operational skills within a few months.
    This plant has also simply established a repair and fitting plant to produce machine parts for the plant. At the same time, the establishment of a fixed maintenance task, maintenance personnel, and maintenance shift system has also played a significant role in ensuring the continuous rise of the production level.

　　抚顺两选煤厂
    本报沈阳23日电　抚顺老虎台矿和龙凤矿的两个选煤厂，开展“比谁给钢铁企业送去的精煤多，比谁加工出来的精煤质量好，比谁加工精制原煤损失少”的大比大赛，为钢铁工业供应了更多更好的炼焦煤。
    在围绕着提高精煤回收率、降低精煤灰分、减少原煤加工损失率等开展的“三比”竞赛中，两个选煤厂首先抓紧提高设备利用率这一重要环节，来加大原煤的入洗量。如老虎台矿选煤厂检修工人推行了“快检快修”经验，运行工人开展了“比谁爱护机械设备好”的竞赛，9月前半月洗煤机每天的运转时间比过去增加了两小时，大大增加了精煤的入洗量。
    同时，这两个厂都千方百计提高精煤回收率，充分利用煤炭。老虎台矿选煤厂职工采取撒“密网”，摆“回收阵”的办法，从厂房内的洗煤槽、污水沟，到厂房外的沉淀池，设下五道“回收关口”，一道关口的筛网比一道密，一天内就能从洗煤水中多回收二号精煤四十多吨。这个选煤厂的工人还在最后一道洗选煤机的上部，增加一道洗煤槽，把洗过的杂煤再多“淘”一遍，既保证了精煤的质量，又提高了回收率。9月前半月，全厂每洗一百吨原煤，就能加工出七十多吨精煤，比今年1至8月平均水平提高2.8％以上。龙凤矿选煤厂工人为了赶上和超过老虎台矿选煤厂，派代表到老虎台矿选煤厂参观，回厂后用废旧材料制成两台翻斗机，每天也能从煤泥中回收二号精煤五十多吨。9月前半月，全厂精煤回收率比今年前八个月的平均水平提高0.7％。
    产量越提高越要重视提高质量。在竞赛中，龙凤矿选煤厂党总支书记简宝全发现有的班灰分高，有的班灰分低。他便到先进班总结经验，到后进班挖掘原因，然后发动全厂工人开“诸葛亮会”，推广刘春喜班经常交流操作经验、小班间开展技术表演赛的做法，并且跟班帮助灰分高的于连成班赶过了刘春喜班，推动全厂精煤质量普遍提高。9月上旬，全厂精煤灰分比8月下旬降低0.37％。老虎台矿选煤厂由于坚持实行“十五分钟取一个样”、“半个小时烧一次灰”（看灰分多少）的检验制度，及时改善操作，9月上旬精煤灰分也比8月下旬降低了0.03％。
    这两个选煤厂通过“三比”竞赛，9月前半月平均每天向鞍钢等企业发出的优质炼焦煤炭，都比8月份有显著增加。
　　望峰岗选煤厂
    本报合肥23日电　淮南望峰岗选煤厂大力提高设备利用率和精煤回收率，保证了月月超额完成国家生产计划。今年1至8月，这个厂的洗煤量超过原设计能力一点三倍。精煤质量月月达到国家规定的指标。9月上旬，日产水平又比1至8月提高5.8％。
    今年以来，这个厂开展了安全生产图表赛、对手赛等多种形式的红旗竞赛，加强了岗位责任制，工人们都做到勤测（机器温度）、勤听（运转声音）、勤检查、勤注油，保证了机械设备经常正常运转。他们还采取改革设备等办法，提高了设备利用率。如斗式提升机原来全部重荷都压在主动轴的圆轮上，受力面小，圆轮容易磨损，一般每半年要换一次，需要停产三十二小时。现在，他们在圆轮两边加上两个六角轮，使受力面加大，减少磨损，使圆轮的使用时间延长了三倍以上。为了加强经常性的设备维护检修工作，这个厂坚持每星期开展一次安全活动日，总结检查一周的安全生产情况，发现问题及时解决。这个厂还制订了十多项行之有效的机器维修制度，使每部设备都有专人负责维护。在加强经常性维护的基础上，这个厂把原来的两班生产、一班检修的制度改成三班生产定期检修（一周二次）。由于采取以上措施，机器设备的运转时间经常保持在二十小时以上，9月份又提高到二十点九三小时，每天生产时间比计划多六分之一。
    为了使机器在运转时间内充分发挥作用，这个厂主动同铁路、煤矿加强协作，保证及时供应生产需要的原煤，并把洗选出的精煤及时运出，避免了因原煤不足或精煤运不出而影响生产的情况。他们每天同铁路、煤矿共同制订两次调运计划，合理组织力量，快装快卸。
    望峰岗选煤厂还千方百计提高了精煤回收率。他们把原来作为民用煤的末中煤，拿到块煤的洗煤机中再洗一遍；将煤泥水管路的布置略加改变，把作为动力煤用的泥煤再洒水过筛，选出粒度较大的精煤。仅以上两项改进，就使精煤的回收率增加了6％左右。
　　唐山矿洗煤厂
    新华社唐山23日电　开滦唐山矿洗煤厂职工，不断进行技术改造和提高技术水平，生产面貌日新月异，成为全国简易洗煤厂一面高产优质的红旗。8月份全厂生产人员虽然减少了三百多人，精煤产量却大大提高，已超过设计能力48％；精煤回收率已达到57％以上，精煤的灰分也合乎国家规定的指标。9月上半月全厂精煤平均日产量，又比8月下半月提高13.99％。
    唐山矿洗煤厂是去年10月份投入生产的一座较大的简易洗煤厂。全厂90％以上都是青年学徒工。由于工厂党组织坚持政治挂帅，使职工们树立起迅速掌握生产技术，生产更多更好的精煤，支援钢铁生产的雄心大志。因此，猛攻生产技术关的群众运动，迅速在全厂范围内开展起来。今年，全厂职工对洗煤、脱水、运输到煤泥处理整个生产过程都进行了一系列的技术改造，使每台主洗机小时产量比原来增加70％以上，脱水筛能力提高了将近一倍，运输能力增加一倍左右。他们还在高等学校和科学研究部门的帮助下，创制成功一种回收煤泥的设备，提高了煤泥的回收率，不但节约了三百名挖煤工人，还从煤泥中每天多回收五百多吨精煤。
    在进行生产技术改造的同时，工人开展了以学习和提高操作技术水平为内容的标兵选拔竞赛。他们采取师傅带徒工，熟手带新手以及技术表演赛等多种形式，在几个月内，使大部分徒工都掌握了操作技术。
    这个厂还因陋就简地建立了修配厂，生产本厂机器配件。同时，建立了固定检修任务、检修人员、检修班次的制度，对保证生产水平的不断上升也起了很大作用。
