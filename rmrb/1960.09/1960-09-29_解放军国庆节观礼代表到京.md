Xinhua News Agency, 28th: The delegation of the Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) attending the 11th Anniversary of the Founding of the People's Republic of China arrived in Beijing on the 27th.

　　This year, the vast majority of the PLA's observation delegation comes from the country's coastal and border defenses and other remote areas. Among them are: Air Force pilot Wang Zimin, who shot down an American-made F-86 aircraft carrying "Sidewinder" missiles on the Fujian front on February 16 this year; Cao Shouen, the observation squad representative of a certain unit who guards the coast day and night with outstanding achievements; and Yi Jianfan, a 61-year-old Red Army veteran representative of the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps, who participated in production in Nanniwan, northern Shaanxi, and has maintained the revolutionary tradition of hard struggle for thirty years.

　　Some of the representatives are heroes, model figures, and pacesetters in the army. Xie Yunhai, a representative from the Shenyang area troops, has been diligent, conscientious, and tirelessly working for the Party for thirteen years since joining the army in 1947. He was named a combat hero of the regiment during the Liberation War and was named a "Five-Good" officer last year. He is a model instructor known as the "Mother of Soldiers." Deng Canquan, a cook representative from the Guangzhou troops, has been awarded merits every year and named a "Five-Good" soldier every month since joining the army in 1958. He is a red banner among new soldiers. Li Ruilan, a company commander of a certain unit, actively studies Chairman Mao's works and can integrate theory with practice, making him a pacesetter in studying Chairman Mao's works in his unit.
