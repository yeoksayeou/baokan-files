    Guiding the Tool Reform Movement with the Thought of Continuous Revolution
    中共黔南布依族苗族自治州委员会 (The Chinese Communist Party Qiannan Buyei and Miao Autonomous Prefecture Committee)

    The tool reform movement in the Qiannan mountain area has entered a new stage since the water conservancy construction last winter. It has developed from single tool improvements to multiple tool improvements and matching sets; from manual operation tools to partial use of animal power, water power, and electric power operation tools; from tool reform for farmland cultivation to a comprehensive reform development of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline production, fishery, and daily necessities. Now, there are indigenous machines in all processes of agricultural production, as well as in water conservancy construction, short-distance transportation, product processing, and daily cooking. Among them, some have been matched into sets in some areas, and some agricultural work done by hand and foot has been replaced by tool operation. These have, to some extent, eased the contradiction of insufficient labor force and become a favorable factor for implementing the policy of "taking agriculture as the foundation." With the vigorous development of the tool reform movement, people's ideological outlook has undergone profound changes. The broad masses of cadres and people have seen the power of indigenous machines, looked forward to the prospect of mechanization, and invested more actively in the tool reform movement.

    In leading the tool reform movement, we follow Chairman Mao's teachings on continuous revolution, grasping today and thinking of tomorrow, thinking of the next step after each step, linking them closely, so that the tool reform movement moves from one victory to another. Last winter and this spring, during the water conservancy construction movement, we led the masses to carry out tool reform on a large scale, and after realizing the serialization of construction earthwork machinery, we immediately applied the experience of water conservancy tool reform to agricultural activities, and successively transferred a large number of migrant workers from the water conservancy construction sites back to the production teams to promote these experiences. In the later stage of the water conservancy construction movement, when the prefectural committee put forward the slogan of vigorously carrying out tool reform centered on spring plowing tools, thanks to sufficient preparation, a high tide of planting tool reform centered on the manufacture and promotion of rice transplanters was quickly set off before the spring sowing. In the later stage of rice transplanting, a field management tool reform movement centered on the promotion and use of weeding rakes and fertilizer applicators was launched. Now, the autumn harvest tool reform centered on harvesters and threshers is being carried out in depth. The tool reform movement develops with the development of the seasons. Carrying out the tool reform for the next season in the previous season, improving and upgrading the tools for the current season while carrying out the tool reform for the season after next, in this way, we can stay ahead of the seasons and give full play to the role of new tools.

    While building rice transplanters on a large scale, we vigorously grasped the preparatory work for the promotion and use of improved tools: running training courses at all levels, holding skill competitions, organizing mobile performances, on-site guidance, in-depth propaganda of the advantages of machine transplanting, teaching the technology of use, and training more than 20,000 technical backbones in one go. In the process of use, through the driving and teaching of these people, the machine transplanting team was quickly expanded, ensuring the widespread use of rice transplanters this year.

    Each victory of the tool reform movement is closely related to the previous step. It consolidates the achievements of the previous step and lays the foundation for the next step. In order to make the previous step smoothly transition to the next step, we must grasp the internal connection between the previous step and the next step. According to the situation in the Qiannan area, we mainly grasped three points: (1) Summarizing, applying and developing the experience of the previous step. Each stage of the tool reform has created some experience (including leadership methods, political work, technology, etc.). Applying and developing these experiences is of great significance to promoting the smooth progress of the tool reform movement. For example, the method of grasping both hands was only understood in principle in the past, but after practice in the tool reform movement, we gained a deep understanding. (2) Relying on the backbones in the previous movement to carry out the next movement. Each stage of the tool reform movement has trained a group of backbones. Relying on their advanced thinking and active leading role can promote the rapid formation and in-depth development of the movement. (3) Actively applying, improving, and upgrading the tools manufactured in the previous stage, and linking the tool reforms of each season to make them serialized. Although the tools used in different seasons are different, the various operation links of the entire production process are closely linked. If there are advanced tools in the previous process, the next process is required to have advanced tools that are adapted to it in terms of labor efficiency and operation specifications. Only in this way can we consolidate and give full play to the role of the improved tools in the previous process. In addition, some tools are used in all four seasons, and most tools can be used in two or three seasons. Actively applying, improving, and upgrading the applicable tools manufactured in the previous step can not only promote the rapid formation of a high tide in the next movement, but also save manpower, materials, and financial resources. The red flag of tool reform—Zisong Commune—applied 90% of the tools from the water conservancy construction site to spring plowing production this spring.

    Each region has its own historical and geographical conditions. Correctly determining the work focus and work order of the previous step and the next step according to these specific conditions is a very important issue. What are the specific conditions in the Qiannan area? It is a mountainous area with complex terrain. The production tools are more backward than in ordinary areas. It has only been seven or eight years since some mountainous areas got rid of wooden farm tools and picked up iron farm tools, and some agricultural work has only been done with tools in the past two years. Under such circumstances, tool reform should pay special attention to starting from indigenous methods and focusing on indigenous methods. Even if the tools are relatively low-level and crude, as long as they improve the work efficiency and reduce the labor intensity compared to the original, they should be vigorously promoted. It is unrealistic to leave the original foundation and try to use advanced tools from the beginning. Starting from indigenous methods and focusing on indigenous methods, we should also pay attention to not losing the opportunity to use foreign methods. It is also wrong if we cannot see the inevitability of developing from improved tools to mechanization, only taking the previous step without considering taking the next step. According to this guiding ideology, we adopted a policy of combining gradual progress and active promotion in leading the tool reform movement, both facing up to the original foundation and attaching importance to gradual improvement. When grasping the reform of transportation tools in mountainous areas, we promoted the use of cattle carrying, horse carrying, ox carts, slides, chutes, skids, and wooden rail cars in the fields on the one hand to replace carrying by shoulders and backs; on the other hand, we actively built simple roads, wide roads, and earthen railways to develop transportation by automobiles, earthen trains, and large animal-powered vehicles.

    The better the previous step of the tool reform movement is carried out, the smoother the conditions will be for the next step. Therefore, we not only grasp the vertical development from the previous step to the next step, but also grasp the horizontal development of each step, and promote the horizontal development of the next step with the horizontal development of the previous step. When grasping the horizontal development of each step, we pay attention to the balance between the advanced and the backward. When striving for a new balance, we grasp advanced things breaking through the old balance with one hand; and grasp backward things catching up with the advanced and establishing a new balance with the other hand. For example, in the tool reform of water conservancy construction, we grasped the central link of transportation and replaced the shoulder carrying of earth with various transportation tools, breaking the balance between the digging, filling, unloading, tamping, and transportation processes; at the same time, we vigorously grasped the tool reform of several processes such as digging, filling, unloading, and tamping, so that these processes re-established a new balance with the earth transportation process, realizing the serialization of water conservancy construction earthwork machinery. This situation initially only appeared in some reservoir construction sites and individual counties. After organizing competitions for backward areas to learn from and catch up with advanced areas, it became popular throughout the prefecture. The realization of the serialization of water conservancy construction earthwork machinery has improved people's ideological understanding, broadened the horizons of the broad masses of cadres and commune members, trained a large number of backbones, and learned how to carry out the tool reform movement on a large scale.

    The tool reform movement in the Qiannan area is advancing along a correct, scientific, and mass-based track on the basis of victory. We are determined to further study Chairman Mao's works, better use the dialectical unity of the theory of continuous revolution and the theory of the stages of revolutionary development to guide the tool reform movement, so as to better implement the policy of taking agriculture as the foundation and strengthen the agricultural front.

    用不断革命的思想指导工具改革运动	中共黔南布依族苗族自治州委员会
    黔南山区的工具改革运动，从去冬兴修水利以来，步入了一个新的阶段。从单项工具改良，发展到多项工具改良、配套；从人力操作工具，发展到部分使用畜力、水力、电力操作工具；从对农田耕作的工具改革，向农、林、牧、副、渔和生活用具的全面改革发展。现在，农业生产的各道工序和兴修水利、短途运输、产品加工、生活炊事等方面，都有了土机械。其中，有的已在部分地区配成套，部分手脚操作的农活，已为工具操作所代替。这些，都在一定程度上缓和了劳动力不足的矛盾，成为贯彻“以农业为基础”方针的有利因素。随着工具改革运动的蓬勃发展，人们的思想面貌发生了深刻变化。广大干部群众看到了土机械的威力，展望机械化远景，更加积极地投入了工具改革运动。
    我们在领导工具改革运动中，遵循着毛主席的不断革命论的教导，一手抓今天，一手抓明天，上步想到下步，步步衔接，环环扣紧，使工具改革运动从一个胜利到另一个胜利。去冬今春，兴修水利运动中，我们领导群众大搞工具改革，实现了施工土机械系列化后，立即把水利工具改革的经验运用到农事活动方面去，并且陆续从水利工地抽调了大批民工，回到生产小队推广这些经验。在兴修水利运动的后期，当州委提出大搞以春耕工具改革为中心的口号时，由于准备工作充分，在春播以前，很快就掀起了以制造、推广插秧机为中心的栽种工具改革高潮。插秧后期，又开展了以推广使用薅秧耙、运肥器为中心的田间管理工具改革运动。现在，以收割机、脱粒机为中心的秋收工具改革，正在深入开展。工具改革运动随季节的发展而发展。上个季节搞下个季节的工具改革，下个季节一面改进提高本季节的工具，一面搞再下一个季节的工具改革，这样，就可以走在季节的前面，充分发挥新式工具的作用。
    在大造插秧机的同时，大力抓紧推广使用改良工具的准备工作：层层开办训练班，召开比武会，组织巡回表演，现场辅导，深入宣传机插优越性，传授使用技术，一鼓作气培养出技术骨干二万多人。在使用过程中，通过这些人的带动和传授，很快扩大了机插队伍，保证了今年插秧机的普遍使用。
    工具改革运动的每一步胜利，都与上步有着密切的联系，它巩固了上步的成绩，又为下步奠定了基础。为了使上步顺利转到下步，必须抓住上步和下步之间的内在联系。根据黔南地区的情况，我们主要抓住了三点：（1）总结、运用和发展上步的经验。工具改革的每一个阶段，都创造了一些经验（包括领导方法、政治工作、技术等方面），运用和发展这些经验，对于促进工具改革运动的顺利进行，有重大意义。例如，两手抓的方法，过去只是在道理上懂得，经过在工具改革运动中的实践，得到了深切的体会。（2）依靠前个运动中的骨干，开展下个运动。工具改革运动的每一阶段，都培养训练了一批骨干。依靠他们的先进思想和积极带头作用，可以促进运动迅速形成，并走向深入。（3）积极运用、改进和提高上一阶段制造的工具，并把各个季节的工具改革联系起来，使其系列化。虽然，不同的季节使用的工具不同，但是，整个生产过程的各个作业环节是密切衔接的，上个工序有了先进工具，就要求下个工序在劳动效率与作业规格上，有与之相适应的先进工具，只有这样，才能巩固和充分发挥上个工序的改良工具的作用。此外，有部分工具是四季运用的，多数工具可以运用两三个季节，积极运用、改进和提高上步制造的可以运用的工具，不仅能够促进下步运动迅速形成高潮，而且可以节省人力、物力和财力。工具改革的红旗——紫松公社，就在今春把水利工地90％的工具，运用到春耕生产上。
    每个地区都有自己的历史条件和地理条件，依照这些具体条件，正确决定上步和下步的工作重心与工作秩序，是一个十分重要的问题。黔南地区的具体条件是什么呢？它是一个地形复杂的山区，生产工具比一般地区落后，部分山区甩掉木质农具，拿起铁质农具，只有七、八年的历史，有的农活在最近两年内才使用工具操作。在这种情况下，工具改革要特别注意从土法着手，以土为主。哪怕是较低级粗糙的工具，只要比原来的工效有所提高，劳动强度有所降低，就应该大力推广。离开原来的基础，企图一开始就能用上高级工具，是不切合实际的。从土法着手，以土为主，要同时注意不失去用洋法的机会。如果看不到从改良工具发展到机械化的必然性，只走上步而不去考虑走下步，也是不对的。根据这个指导思想，我们在领导工具改革运动时，采取循序渐进和积极促进相结合的方针，既正视原有基础，又重视逐步提高。在抓山区的运输工具改革时，我们一方面普遍推广牛驮、马驮、牛车、滑丝、滑槽、滑板、田间木轨车等工具，以代替肩挑背背运输；另一方面，积极兴建简易公路、大车道、土铁道，发展汽车、土火车和大型畜力车运输。
    工具改革运动的上步进行得愈好，下步就会有更加顺利的条件，因此，我们既抓上步到下步的纵的发展，也抓每一步的横的发展，用上步横的发展，促进下步横的发展。在抓每一步横的发展的时候，我们注意先进与后进之间的平衡。在力争新的平衡时，我们一手抓先进事物冲破旧的平衡；一手抓后进事物赶先进建立新的平衡。例如，在水利施工工具改革中，我们抓住运输这个中心环节，以各种运输工具代替肩挑背背运土，冲破了挖、补、卸、夯、运等工序之间的平衡；同时狠抓挖、补、卸、夯等几道工序的工具改革，使这几道工序重新与运土工序建立了新的平衡，实现了水利施工土机械系列化。这种情况，起初只在部分水库工地和个别县出现，经过组织后进地区学先进、赶先进的竞赛后，就在全州范围内普及了。水利施工土机械系列化的实现，提高了人们的思想认识，开阔了广大干部和社员的眼界，培养了大批骨干，学会了大搞工具改革运动。
    黔南地区的工具改革运动，正在胜利的基础上，沿着正确的、科学的、全民的轨道前进。我们决心进一步深入学习毛主席著作，更好地运用不断革命论与革命发展阶段论辩证统一的思想，指导工具改革运动，以更好地贯彻以农业为基础的方针，加强农业战线。
