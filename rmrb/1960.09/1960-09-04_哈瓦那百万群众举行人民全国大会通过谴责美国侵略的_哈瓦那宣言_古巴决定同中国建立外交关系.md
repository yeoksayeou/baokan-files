Xinhua News Agency, Havana, September 2nd – A million Cuban people, filled with anger, gathered here this afternoon in the Plaza de la Civica for a Cuban People's National Assembly to support the revolution and oppose foreign aggression, strongly condemning the United States for forcing the Organization of American States to pass resolutions interfering in Cuba. The assembly also decided in the "Declaration of Havana" it passed: Cuba will immediately sever all relations with the Chiang Kai-shek clique, and establish diplomatic relations with the People's Republic of China.

Today's gathering was a direct response to the U.S.-controlled Organization of American States' Foreign Ministers' meeting in San José, which passed the infamous "Declaration of San José" opposing Cuba and slandering the Soviet Union and China.

Participating in the people's gathering were workers, farmers, militiamen, and people from all walks of life from across the country. The masses angrily shouted: "Down with U.S. imperialism!" "Down with the Declaration of San José!" "Cuba will become the graveyard of U.S. imperialism!" "Long live the relations between Cuba and the socialist countries!" "Long live the unity and friendship of Latin America!" "Long live the unity of the brotherly people of Latin America with Cuba!" "No to the Organization of American States and the Yankees, yes to Cuba!" Eye-catching slogans were written on the placards in the square: "Dollars cannot crush Cuba's dignity," "Any invaders will die here."

Telegrams from people around the world expressing solidarity with the Cuban people were read out at the meeting, including telegrams from the China Peace Committee and the All-China Federation of Trade Unions. These telegrams were met with thunderous applause from the masses.

Cuban Prime Minister Castro delivered a long speech at the meeting. In his speech, Castro reaffirmed that the Cuban government accepted the earlier Soviet declaration of its willingness to provide assistance to Cuba in the event of aggression against Cuba. Castro also solemnly announced, "If the People's Republic of China is also willing to assist us in the event of aggression against Cuba by U.S. imperialism, Cuba will also accept China's assistance." He immediately announced that, from now on, Cuba would sever all relations with the Chiang Kai-shek clique and asked the people to decide whether to establish diplomatic relations with the People's Republic of China. At this moment, the entire crowd erupted in a storm of cheers, with workers and farmers throwing their hats and sombreros into the sky, expressing their enthusiastic support for Castro's announcement.

Castro condemned the United States for convening the San José Foreign Ministers' meeting in an attempt to legitimize U.S. interference in Cuba. He said that the representatives of the countries participating in the Foreign Ministers' meeting did not represent the people of their countries, and if they truly represented the people, "then they would never declare opposition to the interests of the people of an American country, or opposition to the people of all brotherly countries." Castro immediately tore the infamous "Declaration of San José" into pieces in front of a million people.

Castro said at the People's Assembly that U.S. imperialism is "the main enemy of our country's development and progress." Castro told the masses that what we are submitting to the people for consideration today is whether to maintain or abolish the military treaty signed between Cuba and the United States on March 7, 1952. The masses immediately shouted "Abolish!" Thereupon, Castro announced, "According to the independent and autonomous will of the Cuban people, the military treaty between Cuba and the United States is abolished." He warned that if the United States continues to invade Cuba, he will convene such a gathering again and demand that the United States withdraw from the Guantanamo base in Cuba. Amidst the enthusiastic cheers of the masses, Castro also read out and had the assembly pass the "Declaration of Havana," which strongly condemned the U.S. policy of aggression. The declaration announced the formal establishment of diplomatic relations with the People's Republic of China and the immediate severance of all relations with the Chiang Kai-shek clique. As Castro made each suggestion, the crowd continuously shouted "Approve! Approve! Approve!"

    哈瓦那百万群众举行人民全国大会通过谴责美国侵略的“哈瓦那宣言”
    古巴决定同中国建立外交关系
    卡斯特罗总理当场撕碎反对古巴和诬蔑苏中的“圣约瑟宣言”
    并根据古巴人民独立自主的意志，宣布废除古巴美国军事条约
    新华社哈瓦那2日电　一百万古巴人民今天下午怀着愤怒的心情在这里的西维卡广场举行了支持革命、反对外国侵略的古巴人民全国大会，强烈谴责美国强使美洲国家组织通过干涉古巴的决议。大会同时在它通过的“哈瓦那宣言”中决定：古巴立即断绝同蒋介石集团之间的一切关系，并且同中华人民共和国建立外交关系。
    今天的集会是对美国控制的美洲国家组织圣约瑟外长会议的直接回答，这次外长会议通过了臭名远扬的反对古巴和诬蔑苏联、中国的“圣约瑟宣言”。
    参加人民集会的有来自全国各地的工人、农民、民兵和其它各界人民。群众愤怒地高呼：“打倒美帝国主义！”“打倒圣约瑟宣言！”“古巴将成为美帝国主义的坟墓！”“古巴同社会主义国家之间的关系万岁！”“拉丁美洲的团结和友谊万岁！”“拉丁美洲兄弟人民同古巴的团结万岁！”“不要美洲国家组织和美国佬，要古巴！”在广场上的标语牌上写着引人注目的口号：“美元压不倒古巴的尊严”、“任何进犯者都将死在这里”。
    在会上宣读了世界各国人民声援古巴人民的电报，其中包括中国人民保卫世界和平委员会和中华全国总工会的电报。这些电报博得群众们暴风雨般的掌声。
    古巴总理卡斯特罗在会上发表了长篇讲话。卡斯特罗在讲话中重申古巴政府接受早先苏联宣布的万一古巴遭到侵略时愿对古巴提供的援助。卡斯特罗还庄严宣布，“假如中华人民共和国也愿意在古巴遭到美帝国主义侵略时援助我们，古巴也接受中国的援助。”他当即宣布：从现在起，古巴断绝它同蒋介石集团之间的一切关系，并且要求人们决定是否同中华人民共和国建立外交关系。这时，全场群众发出了暴风雨般的欢呼声，工人、农民把他们的帽子和宽边草帽掷向天空，表示热烈拥护卡斯特罗宣布的这个决定。
    卡斯特罗谴责美国召开圣约瑟外长会议是企图使美国对古巴的干涉合法化。他说，参加外长会议的各国代表并不代表他们本国的人民，如果他们果真代表人民的话，“那么他们决不会宣布去反对一个美洲国家人民的利益，去反对所有兄弟国家的人民”。卡斯特罗当着百万群众的面，立即把臭名远扬的“圣约瑟宣言”撕成碎片。
    卡斯特罗在人民大会上说，美帝国主义是“我国发展和进步的主要敌人”。卡斯特罗对群众说，我们今天提交人民考虑，是应该保持，还是应该废除1952年3月7日古巴与美国签订的军事条约。群众当即高呼“废除！”于是卡斯特罗宣布，“根据古巴人民独立自主的意志，废除古巴和美国间的军事条约。”他警告说，如果美国继续侵略古巴，他将再次召集这样的集会，并要求美国从古巴的关塔那摩基地撤走。卡斯特罗在群众的热烈欢呼声中还宣读并由大会通过强烈谴责美国侵略政策的“哈瓦那宣言”，宣言宣布同中华人民共和国正式建立外交关系，并立即断绝同蒋介石集团的一切关系。当卡斯特罗提出每一项建议时，群众不断发出“赞成！赞成！赞成！”的欢呼声。
