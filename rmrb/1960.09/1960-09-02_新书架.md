	"To Huu's Poems"
	To Huu is a famous contemporary Vietnamese poet. This collection contains more than fifty of his poems, translated from To Huu's two collections, "From That Time On" and "Viet Bac." The first part of the poems were written during the period when Vietnam was under the rule of French colonists. These poems mainly expose the brutality and crimes of the colonialists, and reflect the Vietnamese people's struggle against French colonialism and Japanese imperialism for independence. The latter part of the poems were written during the eight-year war of resistance, vividly reflecting the heroic deeds of the Vietnamese people in resisting the invaders and praising the victory of the people. In addition, it also includes the poems written by the poet during his visit to the Soviet Union and China in 1958, such as "Lenin," "The Road to Friendly Nations," and "We Have the Party for Thirty Years," written in 1959.

Among them, those reflecting the life during the War of Resistance include "On the Bank of the Lo River," which praises the heroic resistance of the Vietnamese People's Army against the French invading army on the front line, and "Mr. and Mrs. A Phu," which narrates the underground workers of the Vietnamese Labor Party launching guerrilla warfare in ethnic minority areas. Those reflecting the social struggle after the restoration of peace in 1954 include "Jackfruit Tree," which exposes feudal exploitation and promotes land reform. There are also "Fish Basket" and "Man Gu Attends the Congress Story," which describe the struggle between the two roads, the advanced and the backward, during the period of socialist transformation in rural areas. Vu Huy Tam's "Returning to the Mining Area" recalls the arduous years of adhering to the workers' movement under French colonial rule, and Hong Wu's "Flood Control Commander" portrays the image of a revolutionary cadre who is loyal and dedicated to serving the people.
