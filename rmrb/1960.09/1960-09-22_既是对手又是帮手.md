In the Upsurge of Competition

　　Both Opponents and Helpers
　　In the second workshop of the Guiyang Ganyintang Steel Plant, the workers have launched a new wave of competition. When one shift of workers goes into battle to make steel, there are many workers from other shifts standing by the furnace. They are both opponents and helpers; both judges and messengers for learning and offering treasures.
　　On the first day of the competition, Class C took the lead, creating the highest record in the third quarter, with a 100% qualified ingot rate. Ma Shouyuan, the foreman of Class A, went to Class C to learn from their experience in diligently feeding the furnace with materials, using fine materials, and adjusting the ingredients based on the wind temperature. The next day, they surpassed Class C. Class C continued to improve its work, refining its scheduling, and its production took the lead again. Class A followed suit, humbly learning from Class C, and as a result, refreshed Class C's record. In this way, the two classes clashed for five consecutive days, and the output of both classes rose.
　　While Classes A and C were engaged in fierce competition, He Guisheng, the foreman of Class B, led the veteran workers to operate alongside the two classes, learning the "scripture" of desulfurization from Class A and collecting the "treasure" of comprehensive management and scheduling from Class C. In the second round of the competition, they also caught up.
　　In the fierce competition, all three classes promoted the spirit of communist cooperation. One day, when Class A handed over to Class B, they found that Class B's raw materials were arriving late, and they could not prepare the materials before the shift. The entire class mobilized to help Class B prepare the materials, and gave Class B their prepared fine materials to use first. Class C had a good grasp of steelmaking operation technology, and sent the steelmaker Hu Weidong to Class A to pass on the "scripture". Originally, it took Class A half an hour to make a furnace of steel; with the help of Class C, it was quickly shortened to about fifteen minutes.　　　　　　　　　　(Hua)

专栏：在竞赛高潮中

　　既是对手又是帮手
    在贵阳甘荫塘钢铁厂的第二车间里，职工们掀起了新的竞赛热潮。当一个班的工人上阵炼钢的时候，炉旁就会站着不少其他班的工人。他们既是对手，又是帮手；既是评判员，又是取经、送宝的使者。
    在竞赛开始的第一天，丙班占了上风，创造了第三季度的最高纪录，钢锭合格率达到100％。甲班工长马守元就到丙班取经，学习了丙班勤下料、下细料，以及根据风温配料的操作方法，第二天就超过了丙班。丙班继续改进工作，把调度工作做得更细，生产又领先。甲班跟着虚心向丙班学习，结果又刷新了丙班的纪录。就这样，两个班一连交锋了五天，班产量双双上升。
    当甲、丙两班在热烈进行竞赛的时候，乙班工长贺桂生领着老工人到两个班内跟班操作，取了甲班脱硫的“经”，采了丙班抓全面抓调度的“宝”，在竞赛的第二个回合中也赶了上去。
    三个班在热烈的竞赛中，都发扬了共产主义协作精神。有一天，甲班交班给乙班，发现乙班原料来得晚，班前无法作好备料工作，就全班出动，帮助乙班配料，并且把自己班准备好的精料让给乙班先用。丙班吹炼操作技术掌握得好，便派出吹炼工胡维东到甲班传经。甲班原来吹炼一炉钢需要半个小时；经过丙班帮助，很快缩短到十五分钟左右。　　　　　　　　　　（华）
