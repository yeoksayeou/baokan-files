Xinhua News Agency, 2nd September: Washington dispatch: The U.S. Congress, when passing President Eisenhower's proposed "foreign aid" appropriation bill for the 1961 fiscal year on August 26, specifically passed a clause hostile to the Chinese people.

In this clause, the U.S. Congress once again stated its stubborn adherence to the policy of obstructing China from restoring its legitimate seat in the United Nations. The clause states, "The Congress reaffirms its opposition to the Communist Chinese regime obtaining a seat in the United Nations as the representative of China," and declares that Congress continues to believe that "it should not be recognized as representing China in the United Nations."

In order to continue coercing other countries into supporting this increasingly untenable position of the United States at this year's United Nations General Assembly session, the U.S. Congress also made the following provision in this clause: "In the event that representatives of the Communist Chinese regime obtain a seat in the United Nations Security Council or General Assembly," "the President is directed… to notify the Congress of the implications of this action for American foreign policy and our foreign relations, including implications arising from being a member of the United Nations, and any recommendations the President may make on this issue."

The "foreign aid" appropriation bill in the name of "common security" passed by both houses of the U.S. Congress on this day stipulates a total of $3,722,235,000 for the 1961 fiscal year to serve American foreign aggression and expansion. On August 31, the U.S. Congress also passed a supplementary appropriation bill for foreign "aid" for the 1961 fiscal year, stipulating an additional $65 million as a so-called "defense support" fund, that is, indirect military assistance. This fund will be used to support regimes such as the Chiang Kai-shek clique in Taiwan, South Korea, South Vietnam, Thailand, and the Franco fascist regime in Spain to maintain large armed forces.

    美国要与中国为敌到底
    国会通过条款反对恢复我在联合国合法席位
    新华社2日讯　华盛顿消息：美国国会8月26日在通过总统艾森豪威尔所提出的1961财政年度的“援”外拨款法案时，特别通过了一项敌视中国人民的条款。
    美国国会在这一条款中再一次表明它要死抱住阻挠中国恢复在联合国的合法席位的顽固政策不放。条款中说，“国会重申它反对共产党中国政权作为中国的代表取得联合国的席位”，并且宣布国会继续认为“不应当承认它在联合国代表中国”。
    为了在今年的联合国大会会议上继续胁迫其他国家支持美国这种愈来愈站不住脚的立场，美国国会还在这项条款中作出这样的规定：“万一中国共产党政权的代表在联合国安理会或大会取得席位”，“责成（美国）总统……通知国会关于这一行动对美国外交政策和我们的对外关系的含义，包括由于作为联合国成员国所产生的含义，以及美国总统对这个问题可能提出的任何建议”。
    美国国会参众两院这一天通过的以“共同安全”为名的“援”外拨款法案，规定在1961财政年度拨出总数达三十七亿二千二百三十五万美元的款项，来为美国对外侵略和扩张服务。美国国会在8月31日还通过了一项1961财政年度的对外“援助”补充拨款法案，规定增拨六千五百万美元作为所谓“防御支持”基金，即间接军事援助。这笔款项将用来支持像台湾蒋介石集团、南朝鲜、南越、泰国和西班牙佛朗哥法西斯政权等维持庞大的武装部队。
