Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, September 23rd: Hebei Province has begun sowing winter wheat from north to south in succession. As of September 18th, the province has sown 2.52 million mu of winter wheat.

This year, all parts of Hebei Province have been trying every possible means to expand the wheat planting area. According to arrangements in various places, the winter wheat planting area will be expanded by about 10% compared with last year. In order to strive for a large-scale balanced increase in production next summer, this year, Hebei Province is focusing on high-yield plots, improving the planting quality of high-yield plots, and also focusing on low-yield wheat fields, striving to eliminate the third category of seedlings in low-yield fields during the sowing stage. The Tianjin area has a large amount of saline-alkali land, and in previous years, due to the late sowing period, it suffered from alkali damage, resulting in missing seedlings and broken ridges. This year, this area has summarized the experience of growing good alkali land wheat, and in response to the rule that saline-alkali land has more rain in summer and salt content drops below the cultivated layer, and autumn has little rain and alkali begins to return, it has seized the opportunity of the current low soil salt content and high ground temperature, and universally promoted the measure of appropriately advancing the sowing period. Cangxian, Renqiu, Huanghua, Jiahe and other counties began sowing wheat on saline-alkali land in early September. Now, more than 100,000 mu of alkali land wheat that was sown earlier generally has full and strong seedlings, and there is no phenomenon of missing seedlings and broken ridges. Various places have also expanded the planting area of low-lying wheat according to the favorable conditions of good soil moisture and fertile soil in low-lying areas.

This year, Hebei Province made many preparations in advance to plant enough and plant good winter wheat. The province has prepared 4,000 jin of fertilizer for each mu of wheat field; according to incomplete statistics, various places in the province have newly made and modified more than 270,000 pieces of autumn sowing machinery such as deep plows and close planting drills; the labor force put into the front line in various places has accounted for more than 70% of the total labor force; there are more than 139,000 cadres at the four levels of province, city, county, and commune throughout the province who have gone deep into the front line of production to participate in production and lead production. Various places have also closely grasped the two key measures of promoting early maturity of crops and rationally arranging labor and livestock power, striving for early maturity of late autumn crops to ensure timely wheat planting, based on the characteristics of this year's large number of late autumn crops planted.

Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, September 23rd: Henan Province is seizing the opportunity, taking concrete measures, and accelerating the preparation work for wheat planting in order to plant enough and plant good wheat. At present, some sandy alkali areas and mountainous areas have begun sowing.

Henan Province's spring and summer crop areas this year have both expanded compared to the past, so there are more late-stubble fields in this autumn's planned wheat planting than in the past. In order to ensure that wheat is planted sufficiently and well, various places have paid attention to the arrangement of wheat stubble openings as early as possible. Many areas have taken the lead with the Party committee secretary, deeply publicized the spirit of running agriculture and grain in a big way, carefully checked the land use of this area, this county, this commune, and this team, verified the cultivated land area, and not only made the wheat planting plan from top to bottom and layer by layer planning and from bottom to top discussion and implementation, but also uniformly arranged the spring planting area for next year. The Sangping Commune of Xixia County in Nanyang Prefecture plans to establish a grain base of 23,800 mu, organized 3,900 professional land reclamation laborers, led by Li Jiankun, the first secretary of the commune Party committee, to reclaim land on the mountain. By the end of August, 6,800 mu of land had been reclaimed, and 547 mu of yin slope wheat had been planted along with the reclamation.

In order to adapt to the current busy and overlapping agricultural activities such as harvesting early autumn crops, managing late autumn crops, and preparing for wheat planting, counties generally adopted unified leadership, divided battle lines, comprehensively planned leadership, labor, and livestock power, and arranged them in stages. The Chuhe Commune of Yuxian County planted more than 6,300 mu of early autumn crops. According to the maturity of the crops, the commune Party committee promptly proposed the battle slogan of "Mature autumn does not stay overnight, stubble land does not separate days, and plowed land does not separate noon." Each team drew 30% of the labor and livestock power to form a professional team to seize and harvest early autumn crops and plow and turn stubble land. In three days, it seized and harvested 6,280 mu of early autumn crops and deeply turned 6,200 mu of stubble land. At present, the province has basically achieved harvesting one piece and plowing and turning one piece. Among the cultivated land, more than 50% has been deeply turned about eight inches, and 2.3 million mu has reached the standard of garden-style fields.

In the preparation work for wheat planting, various places have also inspected fertilizers, seeds, and tools. In terms of fertilizer preparation, areas with more preparation have an average of 5,000 to 6,000 jin per mu, general areas have 3,000 to 4,000 jin, and poorer areas have an average of about 2,000 jin per mu. In terms of seed preparation, in addition to checking the amount of seed retention layer by layer according to the amount of seed required, according to the wheat planting area, various places have also carried out preparations such as adjusting surpluses and deficiencies, drying and germination tests.

Xinhua News Agency, Urumqi, September 23rd: The mass movement to rush to plant winter wheat in the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region has fully unfolded in the north and south of the Tianshan Mountains. As of mid-September, the entire autonomous region has planted more than 3.5 million mu of winter wheat.

This year, the winter wheat planting area in Xinjiang has expanded compared with last year, and the preparation work for planting has also been more meticulous and solid than in previous years. As early as the beginning and end of the summer harvest, Party committees at all levels led the broad masses to extensively summarize the experience of planting winter wheat last year, and transferred some labor, livestock power, and machinery to carry out land reclamation, cultivating land in summer, building water conservancy, accumulating fertilizer, and carefully selecting seeds and other wheat planting preparations. It created very good conditions for planting more, planting faster, and planting good winter wheat.

After the sowing began, Party committees at all levels transferred a large number of cadres to go deep into the front line of sowing to lead the masses to rush to plant winter wheat. In Hotan Prefecture, 80% of the cadres at all levels have gone deep into the front line of sowing. Many county Party committees and commune Party committees also moved their offices to the fields to command operations on the spot. After these cadres went deep down, they first grasped the allocation and organization of labor, livestock power, and machinery, based on the situation of Xinjiang's small labor force and short sowing season.

Since the beginning of sowing, many areas in the autonomous region have encountered droughts unprecedented in previous years, and the amount of water in many areas has decreased by 10% to 60% compared with the same period last year. Based on this situation, the people's communes universally adopted the methods of opening up water sources and saving water, trying every possible means to ensure more irrigation and faster sowing. In order to ensure the quality of sowing, many areas also organized various professional groups from the beginning of sowing and established an inspection and acceptance system to ensure sufficient and good planting.

Xinhua News Agency, Yinchuan, September 23rd: The winter wheat sowing in the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region has fully unfolded. As of September 20th, the entire region has sown 550,000 mu of winter wheat.

This year, the winter wheat planting area in the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region has expanded by 37% compared with last year. Longde, Jingyuan, Guyuan and other counties in the Liupan Mountain area have also expanded the planting of cold-resistant, drought-resistant and disease-resistant winter-sown foreign wheat this year, according to the natural characteristics of high-cold, humid, and shady conditions in the Liupan Mountain area. Zhongning, Zhongwei and other counties, which planted less winter wheat in the past, have also greatly increased the winter wheat planting area this year compared with previous years.

Various places have appropriately advanced the winter wheat sowing period according to specific conditions, mostly starting sowing around "White Dew." Due to the relatively full preparation work before sowing, the entire region has progressed at a rate of more than 40,000 mu per day since the start of sowing. Guyuan Prefecture in the southern mountainous area, where more winter wheat is planted, has universally carried out summer plowing on winter wheat fields, and some have even achieved three turns and three harrows. The amount of fertilizer applied generally reaches more than 2,000 jin per mu. Guyuan Prefecture has also universally established winter wheat experimental fields, high-yield demonstration fields, and large-area high-yield fields, which greatly improves the quality of sowing.

After the sowing began, there was a general lack of rain in various places, and the drought was quite serious in some places. In order to plant more, plant well, and plant winter wheat in a timely manner, the broad masses of cadres went deep into the sowing front lines and led the masses to fight drought and rush to plant.

    千方百计扩大播种面积提高播种质量
　　抓紧季节种足种好小麦
　　河北河南新疆宁夏热烈开展播种小麦的群众运动
    据新华社天津23日电　河北省从北到南先后开始播种冬麦。到9月18日止，全省已播种冬麦二百五十二万亩。
    今年河北省各地千方百计扩大小麦播种面积。根据各地的安排，冬麦播种面积将比去年扩大10％左右。为了争取明年夏季大面积平衡增产，今年河北省各地在秋播中，一方面大抓丰产方，提高丰产方的播种质量，一方面狠抓低产麦田，力争把低产田的三类苗消灭在播种阶段。天津地区盐碱地较多，历年因为播种期晚遭受碱害，造成缺苗断垅。今年这个地区总结了种好碱地麦的经验，针对盐碱地夏季雨多盐份降到耕层以下，秋季雨水稀少又开始返碱的规律，抓住当前土壤含盐量低、地温高的机会，普遍推行了适当提早播种的措施。沧县、任丘、黄骅、交河等县，从9月上旬就开始在盐碱地播种小麦。现在播种较早的十万多亩碱地麦普遍苗全苗壮，没有缺苗断垅的现象。各地还根据洼地墒情好、土质肥的有利条件，因地制宜地扩大了洼地麦的播种面积。
    今年河北省为种足种好冬麦，提前进行了许多准备工作。全省已为每亩麦田备好肥料四千斤；据不完全统计，全省各地已新制、改制深耕犁、密植耧等秋播机具二十七万多件；各地投入第一线的劳力已占总劳力70％以上；全省有省、市、县、公社四级十三万九千多名干部深入到生产第一线，参加生产，领导生产。各地还根据今年晚秋作物种得多的特点，紧紧抓住了促使作物早熟和合理安排劳畜力两项关键性措施，力争晚秋作物早熟，保证适时种麦。
    据新华社郑州23日电　河南省为种足种好小麦正抓紧时机，采取具体措施，加速进行种麦各项准备工作。目前，部分沙碱地区和山区已经开始播种。
    河南省今年的春播和夏播作物面积都比过去扩大，因而在今秋计划播种的小麦中，晚茬地比过去多。为了保证把小麦种足、种好，各地及早地注意了种麦茬口的安排。不少地区都以党委书记挂帅，深入宣传大办农业、大办粮食的精神，仔细检查了本地区、本县、本社、本队的土地利用情况，核实耕地面积，不仅使小麦播种计划做到了自上而下层层规划与自下而上讨论落实，并且统一安排了明年的春播面积。南阳专区西峡县桑平公社规划建立粮食基地二万三千八百亩，组织三千九百个开荒专业劳力，由公社党委第一书记李建坤带领上山开荒，到8月底已开荒六千八百亩，并随开随种阴坡麦五百四十七亩。
    各县为了适应当前收早秋、管晚秋、准备种麦等各项农活繁忙而又交叉进行的特点，一般地都采取统一领导，划分战线，把领导力量、劳力、畜力全面计划，分段安排。禹县褚河公社种早秋六千三百余亩，公社党委根据作物的成熟情况，及时提出：“熟秋不过夜、茬地不隔天、犁地不过晌”的战斗号召，各队抽出了30％的劳力、畜力，组成抢收早秋和耕翻茬地专业队，边收边耕，三天时间就抢收早秋六千二百八十亩，深翻茬地六千二百亩。目前全省基本做到了收一块，耕翻一块，在已耕翻的地块中，有50％以上深翻八寸左右，二百三十万亩达到了园田化标准。
    各地在种麦准备工作中，还对肥料、种籽、工具等进行了检查。在肥料准备方面，准备较多的地区每亩平均达到五千到六千斤，一般地区有三千到四千斤，较差地区每亩平均也有二千斤左右。在种籽准备方面，各地除层层按照下种量要求，根据麦播面积普遍查实留种量外，还进行了余缺调剂、翻晒和发芽试验等准备。
    据新华社乌鲁木齐23日电　新疆维吾尔自治区抢种冬麦的群众运动已在天山南北全面展开。截至9月中旬，全自治区已种冬麦三百五十多万亩。
    今年，新疆的冬麦播种面积比去年扩大了，播种的准备工作也比往年抓得更细致、更扎实。早在夏收开始前后，各级党委就一面领导广大群众，广泛总结去年播种冬麦的经验，一面调出部分劳、畜力和机具，提早进行开荒造田、伏耕土地、兴修水利、积肥造肥和精选良种等种麦准备工作。为多种、快种和种好冬麦，创造了很好的条件。
    播种开始后，各级党委就抽调大批干部，深入播种第一线，领导群众抢种冬麦。和田专区各级已有80％的干部深入到播种第一线。不少县委和公社党委还把办公室搬到地头，就地指挥作战。这些干部深入下去以后，首先根据新疆劳动力少、播种季节短等情况，狠抓劳、畜力和机具的调配和组织工作。
    自治区许多地区从播种开始以来，都碰到了历年所未有的旱象，不少地区的水量比去年同期减少了10％到60％。根据这种情况，各人民公社普遍采取了开辟水源、节约用水的办法，千方百计保证多浇地、快播种。为了保证播种质量，许多地区从播种一开始，还组织了各种专业组，建立了检查验收制度保证种足种好。
    新华社银川23日电　宁夏回族自治区冬麦播种已经全面展开。截至9月20日，全区已播种冬麦五十五万亩。
    今年宁夏回族自治区的冬麦播种面积比去年扩大37％。六盘山地区的隆德、泾源、固原等县，今年还根据六盘山地区高寒阴湿的自然特点，扩大种植了耐寒、耐旱和抗病较强的冬种洋麦，过去种植冬麦较少的中宁、中卫等县，今年冬麦播种面积也都比往年大大增加。
    各地根据具体条件都适当地提早冬麦播种期，大多在“白露”前后开始下种。由于播前准备工作作得比较充分，开播之后全区平均每天以四万多亩的速度向前进展。种植冬麦较多的南部山区的固原专区，普遍对冬麦田进行了伏耕，有的还做到三翻三耱。施肥量一般每亩达到二千多斤，固原专区还普遍建立了冬麦试验田、高额丰产田、大面积丰产田，使播种质量大大提高。
    在播种开始后，各地普遍缺雨，有些地方旱象相当严重。为了把冬麦种多、种好、种适时，广大干部都深入播种前线，带领群众进行抗旱抢种。（附图片）
