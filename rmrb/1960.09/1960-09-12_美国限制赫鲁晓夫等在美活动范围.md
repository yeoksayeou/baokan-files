Xinhua News Agency, Washington, 11th: The U.S. State Department has sent notes to the Soviet Union and some other Eastern European socialist countries regarding the upcoming attendance of Soviet Chairman of the Council of Ministers, Khrushchev, and other heads of government of Eastern European socialist countries at the 15th session of the United Nations General Assembly, restricting the scope of activities of these countries' government leaders in the United States.

In its note to the Soviet Union, the United States stated that the issue of ensuring Khrushchev's safety has been "complicated" due to the Soviet Union's downing of an American spy plane. The note stated that, as a result, the United States requires Khrushchev to "reside in a location closest to and most convenient to the United Nations headquarters," and stipulates that during the UN General Assembly session, his activities shall not extend beyond the confines of Manhattan Island (22.3 square miles).

The State Department's note also requested that the Soviet Union "promptly notify" the United States of "the exact time of Khrushchev's arrival, place of residence, length of stay, and the date and method of departure."

The U.S. State Department also sent notes to the governments of Albania and Hungary, imposing similar restrictions on the representatives of these countries attending the United Nations as those imposed on the Soviet Union.

    美国限制赫鲁晓夫等在美活动范围
    新华社11日讯　华盛顿消息：美国国务院就苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫和东欧其他一些社会主义国家政府首脑将要出席联合国大会第十五届会议一事向这些国家发出照会，限制这些国家政府领导人在美国的活动范围。
    美国在给苏联的照会中说为赫鲁晓夫保证安全的问题由于苏联击落了美国的间谍飞机“而复杂化了”。照会说，为此，美国要求赫鲁晓夫“居住在离联合国总部最靠近而方便的地方”，而且规定在联大会议期间，他的活动不超出曼哈顿岛（二十二点三平方英里）的范围。
    国务院的照会还要求苏联把赫鲁晓夫“抵达的确切时间、居住地点、逗留多久，以及离开的日期和方法”“尽速通知”美国。
    美国国务院还向阿尔巴尼亚政府和匈牙利政府发出照会，对这些国家出席联合国的代表施加了同对苏联的类似的限制。
