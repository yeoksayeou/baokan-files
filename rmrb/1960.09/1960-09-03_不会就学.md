    Learn What You Don't Know
    Chen Zhiyan
    To pretend to understand when you don't, to pretend to know when you don't, is an unscientific and dishonest attitude.
    To admit you don't understand when you don't, to admit you don't know when you don't. If you don't understand or know, then learn, until you understand and learn it. This is a scientific and honest attitude.
    The workers of the No. 1 Open Hearth Furnace Workshop of the Shanghai No. 1 Steel Plant visited the No. 1 Pig Iron Furnace of the No. 2 Open Hearth Furnace Workshop of the Shanghai No. 3 Steel Plant six times to learn from their advanced experience. This learning spirit of not giving up until the goal is achieved is a scientific and honest attitude. The workers of the No. 1 Open Hearth Furnace Workshop of the Shanghai No. 1 Steel Plant, with this attitude, learned tenaciously, and they did learn it. The daily output of converter steel rose steadily.
    We are now in an era of great leap forward, an era in which the initiative and creativity of hundreds of millions of people are greatly developed, and advanced things are emerging in all aspects. A certain person, a certain group, or a certain workshop can create their own advanced experience, but comprehensive advanced experience must be a collective creation of the masses. Therefore, the advanced experience that one has can be learned by others, and the advanced experience that one does not have can be learned from others. Through this kind of mutual learning, every advanced experience quickly becomes the wealth of the whole society, and then the productivity of the whole society is greatly improved. This is a unique feature of socialist society, and one of the factors that the development speed of the productive forces of socialist society is bound to exceed the development speed of the productive forces of capitalist society. In capitalist society, every invention and creation is used by a monopoly capital group as a means to obtain greater profits, and is strictly sealed off and protected as private property. Striving and competing, and mutual crushing, are their characteristics. As for mutual learning and telling their secrets to others, that is impossible for them. Because if you learn it, it means the reduction or even disappearance of their huge profits. Capitalist masters will not do such stupid things. Therefore, mutual learning between enterprises, learning from each other's strengths and making up for weaknesses, so that every advanced experience becomes the common experience of people, is a sign of the superiority of socialism.
    However, superiority also depends on how people use it. The better it is used, the greater the role it plays. How to use it better? The key lies in learning, learning honestly. Whether it is an individual, a group, a workshop, or an enterprise, at any time and in any place, there are differences between the advanced, the intermediate, and the backward. This is the law of the development of things. It is impossible for ten fingers to be the same length. Therefore, the backward and the intermediate must learn from the advanced, and must not be ashamed to ask, and learn honestly. Learning without being honest is also not learning well. Here, what is particularly worthy of our attention is that those units that were originally advanced must also not be ashamed to ask, and must also learn honestly. In this regard, the No. 1 Open Hearth Furnace Workshop of the Shanghai No. 1 Steel Plant has also set a good example for us. This workshop was originally one of the eight red flags on the industrial front in Shanghai in 1958, and was a top-notch advanced unit. However, they did not become complacent because of this. They were determined to learn what they did not know, and they were not ashamed to ask, and they learned honestly, until they learned it. If the comrades of the No. 1 Open Hearth Furnace Workshop of the Shanghai No. 1 Steel Plant did not adopt this correct attitude, were blinded by the title of advanced unit, stuck to the old ways, and neither asked nor learned, then their pig iron furnace would certainly not be able to pass the test, and the daily output of steel would certainly not be able to rise steadily. It can be seen that the attitude taken towards learning is very related to promoting a substantial increase in production.
    An ancient saying says: "Only after learning do you know your deficiencies." Knowing your own deficiencies is very important. Thinking that you have everything you need, and you don't need to learn anymore, then even the advanced will fall behind and become backward. Humbly admitting your own deficiencies, and honestly and diligently learning, the backward will also reach the advanced level, and deficiencies will become sufficient. Of course, this kind of sufficiency is relative. Under certain conditions, sufficiency will become insufficient again. Therefore, learning cannot be done for a period of time and not done for another period of time, but must be constantly learned, constantly created, and constantly turned insufficient into sufficient, that is, constantly raising oneself to an advanced level.

    不会就学
    陈之衍
    不懂装懂，不会装会，这是一种不科学、不老实的态度。
    不懂就承认不懂，不会就承认不会。不懂，不会，就去学，一直到学懂了，学会了。这是一种科学的、老实的态度。
    上海第一钢铁厂第一转炉车间的职工，六次登门学习上海第三钢铁厂第二转炉车间的一号化铁炉的先进经验，这种不达目的誓不罢休的学习精神，就是一种科学的老实的态度。上钢一厂第一转炉车间的职工，抱定了这种态度，顽强地去学，果然就学会了，转炉钢的日产量节节上升了。
    我们现在是处在一个跃进的年代，一个千百万群众主动性、创造性大发扬的年代，各方面都涌现出万紫千红的先进事物。某个人、某个小组、某个车间，都会创造出自己的先进经验，但是全面性的先进经验，必然是群众性的集体创造。所以，自己有的先进经验，可供别人来学，自己没有的先进经验，可以去学别人。经过这种相互学习，每一种先进经验，都迅速成为全社会的财富，于是整个社会的生产力就大大提高一步。这是社会主义社会所独有的特点，是社会主义社会的生产力的发展速度，必然超过资本主义社会生产力发展速度的因素之一。在资本主义社会，每一项发明创造，都被某一个垄断资本集团作为谋取更大利润的手段，作为私有财产严密地封锁着、保护着。你争我夺，相互倾轧，是他们的特点，至于相互学习，把自己的秘密告诉别人，在他们那是办不到的。因为，你学去了，就意味着他的巨额利润的减少甚至消失，资本家老爷是不干这种蠢事的。所以，各个企业之间，相互学习，取长补短，使每一项先进经验，都成为人们的共同经验，这是社会主义优越性的标志。
    可是优越性也要看人们怎样去利用它。利用得越好，发挥的作用就越大。怎样才利用得更好？关键在于学，老老实实地学，个人也好，小组也好，车间也好，企业也好，任何时候，任何地方，都有先进的、中间的、落后的差别，这是事物发展的规律。十个指头一般齐是不可能的。所以落后的、中间的就要向先进的去学，而且要不耻下问，老老实实地学。学而不老实也是学不好的。在这里，特别值得引起我们重视的，是那些原来是先进的单位，也要不耻下问，也要老老实实地学。在这方面，上钢一厂第一转炉车间，也给我们做出了好样子。这个车间，原来是1958年上海市工业战线上的八面红旗之一，是顶刮刮的先进单位。可是，他们并没有因此自满起来，他们抱定了不会就学的态度，一样不耻下问，一样老老实实地学，一直到学会为止。如果上钢一厂第一转炉车间的同志们，不采取这种正确的态度，被先进单位的称号迷住了眼睛，故步自封，既不问也不学，那末他们的化铁炉肯定还是过不了关，钢的日产量也肯定不能节节上升。可见，对于学，采取什么态度，对于促进生产大幅度上升，是很有关系的。
    古语说：学而后知不足。知道自己不足，是很重要的。以为自己一切都足了，不要再学了，那样先进者也会掉下去，变为落后者。虚心地承认自己不足，老实地刻苦地去学，落后者也会达到先进水平，不足会变为足。当然这种足，是相对而言，在一定条件下，足又会变为不足。所以学，不能一个时期学，一个时期不学，而要不断地学，不断地创造，不断地把不足变为足，也就是不断地把自己提高到先进的水平。
