    Learning from the Lofty Aspirations of Mountaineering Heroes
    —After Beijing Audiences Watch "Conquering the World's Highest Peak"
    Cai Lianxing (Driver of the Mao Zedong locomotive at Fengtai Locomotive Depot): Watching the film "Conquering the World's Highest Peak" evokes a different feeling than watching other films; I knew it would be very educational. After watching it, I was extremely excited and proud. So many adventurers from capitalist countries had longed to climb the mountain and tried, but none succeeded, because they lacked collective strength and were just individuals. Foreigners used to call us "the sick men of East Asia," but look, now "the sick men of East Asia" have reached the world's highest peak! Even the elderly say it truly brings honor to our country. The main thing is that we have the leadership of the Party; what our predecessors couldn't do, we can do!
    We at the Fengtai Locomotive Depot have our own special circumstances. In winter, it's freezing cold, and when strong winds blow, it greatly affects the quick loading and hauling on the railway. But this difficulty should and can be overcome compared to climbing the peak. After watching the film and thinking it over, we must maintain high efficiency even in winter.
    Our film doesn't deliberately mystify or include sensational scenes. This is where we differ from films in capitalist countries. But in reality, it must have been even more thrilling than the film shows. At the time, it was too difficult to film; people could hardly breathe and couldn't spare the time to film. Those who haven't experienced that life can't appreciate it. The only pity is that the moment of reaching the summit wasn't filmed, as that was the most difficult and most exciting and inspiring peak.
    Wang Zhiguo (Worker at Shijingshan Iron and Steel Company): The film was very educational for me. Under the leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, we are invincible and can overcome any difficulty. In temperatures of minus thirty or forty degrees Celsius, in twelve-force winds, with thin air, along cliffs, step by step, they climbed to the highest peak! Foreigners look down on us because we have more people than steel. We are changing the "poor and blank" situation. The Party's call for increased production and frugality, with grain and steel as the main focus, is a great policy. We have already achieved some success. Our factory's monthly output already equals a year's output in old China, but we are not satisfied; we will never be satisfied, and we must continuously revolutionize to make steel production reach the world's peak. Now, our factory's steel production is rising day by day. With the leadership of the Party, our cadres go deep into the front lines, adhere to the "four togethers," and with the enthusiasm of the masses, everyone is full of confidence and can climb the peak step by step. The mountaineers' strong will and indomitable spirit are truly touching; this heroic spirit is the style of our working class. I hope this film will be shown more in factories.
    Li Jiude (Coal Miner, Chengzi Coal Mine): During the climb, one difficulty after another arose, but the mountaineers were not intimidated. In groups of four, sharing the same fate and breathing together, they did what no one in ancient or modern times, in China or abroad, had been able to do, bringing honor to the motherland.
    I have encountered many difficulties in my work, sometimes being intimidated, sometimes overestimating myself. The film has given me a great education; we must strategically despise difficulties and tactically value them to overcome them. I am a soldier on the coal front, and I must climb to the world's highest peak on this front. We must have lofty ambitions and great ideals to change the "poor and blank" situation.
    I hope this film will be sent to factories and mines to be shown, so that young people will be inspired and old people will dispel superstitions.
    In one scene in the film, the time of the march was not clearly stated. It would be best to specify the date and time, and the altitude of the icy and snowy conditions where they rested.
    Li Dexin (Secretary of the Party General Branch, Yongdingmen Grain Depot): I haven't seen many films that are so moving; this can be said to be the first. The educational significance of this film is particularly profound, a manifestation of going all out, aiming high. The young Chinese mountaineers reached the world's highest peak, marking the victory of the Party's leadership. Their spirit of mutual assistance and fraternal collectivism is worth learning from.
    The film shows the spirit of the Chinese people. The Chinese people have stood up. What the imperialists could not do, we have done. The weather at the peak is changeable, unpredictable, with violent winds and blizzards, but we overcame them all. This is a remarkable achievement. The young mountaineers are invincible, "Even if the peak is higher than the sky, we will make the red flag fly in the wind." Lofty aspirations, combined with a pragmatic and meticulous preparation, advanced in a step-by-step fashion in four battles. Each march was carefully scouted; every road and every step was taken with meticulous care. This is the concrete manifestation and glorious victory of Chairman Mao's strategic and tactical thinking in sports. Combining soaring enthusiasm with scientific analysis makes us invincible. This is the example I must learn from.
    I am a grain keeper. Although the grain depot where I work has been rated as an advanced collective, we have not done enough. In the current movement of increasing production and practicing economy, with grain and steel as the main focus, I must complete the glorious task assigned to me by the Party of storing grain well. We must face the supply and face the production, to achieve the "seven no's" grain depot. We also have difficulties, but compared to climbing the highest peak, they are nothing, too small. Our part in saving grain is very important; we must not let down our peasant brothers. We must not lose a single grain that comes into our hands. We must improve heavy labor, shorten unloading time, and free up manpower to support agricultural production. We must make a groundbreaking achievement in grain storage, just like climbing the peak.
    Zhang Junxiu (Athlete): The film has good political content and artistry. The narration is beautiful and can record our mountaineering movement well, so that after we see it, we will always remember it and learn from their spirit.
    Reaching the world's highest peak is only possible under our socialist system. Many capitalist countries cannot do it.
    The Party's many years of cultivation—the tenacious spirit and communist collaboration—are something that athletes in capitalist countries cannot have. Even if several of them climb mountains together, they always hope that their companions will fail so that they can succeed and become famous. But we are not like that. For the collective honor, we take over the difficulties of others—grabbing their backpacks and carrying them ourselves.
    We need to learn from their spirit and continuously improve the level of our country's football. Compared to the mountaineers, our difficulties are nothing.
    Our country's mountaineering history is not long, and we have achieved such great results in a short period of time. As long as we learn, we can definitely raise the level of our other sports to the world's peak!

    学习登山英雄的雄心壮志
    ——北京观众看《征服世界最高峰》后
    蔡连兴（丰台机务段毛泽东号机车司机）：说看《征服世界最高峰》的电影，比看别的心境不一样，心想一定能受到很大的教育。看了以后，兴奋之至，还感到骄傲。多少资本主义国家的探险家曾经想望和试过登山，没一个成功，因没有集体力量，单枪匹马。外国人说我们是“东亚病夫”，看看现在“东亚病夫”登上了世界最高峰！连老人都说，真为我们国家增光。主要是有了党的领导，前人做不到的我们却能做到！
    我们丰台机务段有我们自己的特殊情况，一到冬季，天寒地冻，一刮大风，铁路上多装快拉就大受影响。但这困难同登高峰比就应该而且可以克服。看看电影再寻思寻思，一定要在冬天也保持高效率。
    我们的影片没有故弄玄虚，没有惊险境头，这正是我们同资本主义国家的电影不同处。但实际一定有比电影惊险万状的，当时拍不下来，人呼吸都困难了，顾不上拍。没经过这生活的，没法体会。唯一可惜的是没能把登上最高峰拍摄下来，那是最困难也是最令人兴奋鼓舞的顶峰。
    王治国（石景山钢铁公司工人）：电影对我教育很大。在党和毛主席领导下，我们无坚不摧，无难不克。在零下三、四十度，在十二级大风里，空气稀薄，沿着悬崖绝壁，一步一步登上最高峰！外国人看我们人多钢少，看不起我们。我们正在改变“一穷二白”情况。党号召以粮食和钢铁为主的增产节约是伟大政策。我们已取得一些成绩，我们厂一月产量已抵旧中国一年产量，但我们并不满足，我们永不满足，要不断革命，要使钢产量达到世界高峰。现在我厂钢产量正日升月涨。有党的领导，我们干部深入第一线，坚持四同，有群众干劲，大家信心百倍，可以一步一步攀登高峰。登山队员的坚强意志，不屈不挠的精神实在感人，这英雄气概是我们工人阶级的风格。希望多在工厂里放映这部影片。
    李九德（城子煤矿采掘工）：登山时困难一个接一个，但登山队员没被吓倒，四人一组，同命运共呼吸，做出了中外古今前人所做不到的事，为祖国增光。
    我在工作中碰到过不少困难，有时被吓倒，有时又过分轻视它。电影给我很大教育，我们既要战略上藐视困难，也要战术上重视困难，才能克服困难。我是煤炭战线战士，一定要在这条战线上攀登世界最高峰。我们一定树雄心立大志，改变“一穷二白”的状况。
    希望把这个电影送到工厂和矿山去放映，让青年人看了得到鼓舞，老年人看了破除迷信。
    电影中有一次行军，时间没说清楚，最好能说明是几月几日夜里，在多高的冰天雪地里休息。
    李德信（永定门粮食仓库党总支书记）：这样感动人心的电影我看得还不多，可说是第一次。这电影的教育意义特别深刻，是鼓足干劲、力争上游的表现。年轻的中国登山运动员登上了世界最高峰，标志着党的领导的胜利。他们的互助友爱的集体主义精神，值得我们学习。
    电影显示了中国人民的气魄，中国人民站起来了，帝国主义做不到的事情，我们做到了。高峰天气变化无常，瞬息万变，狂风暴雪，但是我们都克服了，这是了不起的大事。年轻的登山运动员所向无敌，“哪怕顶峰比天高，定叫红旗迎风飘”。雄心壮志，加上实事求是、周密细致的准备，分四个战役，有步骤前进，每次行军都作了周密的侦察，每一条路每一步都如此。这是毛主席战略战术思想在运动上的具体表现和光辉胜利。冲天干劲和科学分析相结合，就战无不胜，攻无不克。这是我学习的榜样。
    我是粮食保管员，我工作的这个粮库虽被评为先进集体，但是我们作得还很不够。当前以粮食和钢铁为主的增产节约运动中，我一定要很好地完成党交给我的保管粮食的光荣任务。我们要面向供应，面向生产，达到“七无”粮库。我们也有困难，比之登上最高峰，就不算困难了，太渺小了。我们这一关在节约粮食中很重要，决不能对不起农民兄弟，到我们手里的粮食决不能损失一颗。笨重劳动要改善，缩短卸车时间，腾出人力支援农业生产。要在粮食保管上做出登上高峰的创举。
    张俊秀（运动健将）：电影政治内容与艺术性都很好，解说词很美，能把我们这次登山运动很好记录下来，使我们看到后，永远记在心里，好好学习他们的精神。
    登上世界高峰，只有在我们的社会主义制度下才可能。许多资本主义国家却不能。
    党多年的培养——顽强的精神、共产主义协作是资本主义国家运动员所不能有的，他们纵使数人结伴登山，但是他们总是彼此希望同伴失败，自己成功出名。而我们则不然，为了集体的荣誉，把别人的困难——背包抢过来自己背。
    我们需要学习他们的精神，不断提高我国的足球运动水平。比起登山队员来我们的困难实在不算什么。
    我国登山运动历史不长，短时间内就创造出这么大成绩，我们只要学习，一定也可以使我们其他运动的水平登上世界高峰！（附图片）
