Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin Telegram The Wu'an Iron and Steel Plant in Handan City systematically summarized the advanced experiences of high quality, high yield, low consumption, safety, and longevity scattered among various blast furnaces, coordinated them into a complete set, and universally promoted them, thus promoting a substantial, comprehensive, and sustained leap forward in production. In August, the plant's pig iron production overfulfilled the plan, increasing by 22.2% compared to July; the average pig iron qualification rate reached 79%; the consumption of coke per ton of iron was reduced to 0.897 tons, a decrease of 0.093 tons compared to July; and the operating time of the blast furnaces increased by 21% compared to July.

The plant mobilized the masses of workers to review the production history data of each furnace from January 1959 to July of this year. After comparison, they finally summarized the experience of No. 8 blast furnace for high yield and high quality for three consecutive months, the experience of No. 3 blast furnace for long furnace life, the experience of No. 7 blast furnace in reducing the coke ratio to 0.5 tons, and the experience of No. 20 blast furnace in safe and high production without accidents for half a year. During the summary, the workers on these blast furnaces summarized and enriched the experiences, further improving and enhancing them. While summarizing, the workers of No. 8 blast furnace found that their on-site management was poor, so they learned and promoted the on-site management experience of the Xincheng Iron and Steel Plant. In the past, they did not clean the front of the furnace, but now they clean it once per shift, ensuring that the front of the furnace is clean and tidy, and that raw materials and tools are stored in an orderly manner.

Due to the summary and promotion of advanced experience in five aspects, seven blast furnaces in the plant have achieved a comprehensive leap forward in high yield, high quality, low consumption, and safety.

    邯郸武安炼铁厂
    各项指标齐跃进
    新华社天津电  邯郸市武安炼铁厂，系统总结分散在各个高炉的优质、高产、低耗、安全和长寿五个方面的先进经验，配套成龙，普遍推广，促进了生产大幅度全面持续跃进。8月份全厂生铁产量超额完成了计划，比7月份提高22.2％；生铁合格率平均达到79％；炼每吨铁消耗的焦炭降到了0.897吨，比7月份降低0.093吨，高炉的作业时间比7月份增加了21％。
    这个厂发动职工群众，查阅了1959年1月到今年7月各炉的生产历史资料，经过比较，最后总结了八号高炉连续三个月高产优质的经验，三号高炉炉龄长寿的经验，七号高炉焦化比降低到0.5吨的经验，二十号高炉半年无事故安全高产的经验。在总结中，这些高炉上的工人边总结、边充实，使这些经验进一步完善，提高。八号高炉工人在总结中，发现自己炉子的现场管理差，就学习推广了新城炼铁厂的现场管理经验，过去不打扫炉前，现在每班打扫一次，作到炉前整洁，原料、工具存放有秩序。
    全厂由于总结和推行了五个方面的先进经验，已有七座高炉实现了高产、优质、低耗、安全的全面跃进。
