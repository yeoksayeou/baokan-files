Strengthening Short-Distance Transportation to Promote Increased Grain Production
Heilongjiang Province Rushes to Build Vehicles and Boats for "Three Autumns" Production
Xinjiang Yingjisha County Communes and Brigades Establish Animal-Powered Transportation Teams
    (Reported by this newspaper) Factories and enterprises in various parts of Heilongjiang Province are stepping up the production of vehicles and boats to support the "Three Autumns" production. By the end of August, they had manufactured 12,000 rubber-wheeled carts and 19,000 tons of wooden sailboats.
    In order to speed up the manufacturing of vehicles, many regions have adopted a method combining specialized factory manufacturing with commune and non-specialized factory manufacturing. In the Qiqihar area, 31 units are undertaking the task of manufacturing large carts. While expanding the shipbuilding capacity of existing shipyards, the Hejiang area mobilized counties and communes along the rivers to build wooden sailboats on a large scale. There are now nine shipbuilding bases in the region. Since April, various ships with a tonnage of more than 8,800 have been built.
    Factories undertaking the task of manufacturing vehicles and boats have adopted measures such as vigorously engaging in product innovation and broadening the sources of materials to use less material and complete tasks better. The Fujin County Shipyard adopted the method of "adding nails according to the material," saving five kilograms of steel per ton of ship capacity.
    (This newspaper Urumqi, September 25th) Yingjisha County in the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, based on the new situation of agricultural production development and local specific conditions, relies on the masses to vigorously develop animal-powered transportation. At present, the five people's communes in the county have established five commune-run animal-powered transportation teams, 91 management district-organized animal-powered transportation teams, and 45 production brigade-organized animal-powered transportation teams. The number of various vehicles and livestock participating in transportation has increased significantly compared to last year. The county has formed a strong animal-powered transportation force serving agricultural production. With this transportation force, without relying on national automobile transportation, material transportation is timely and does not delay agricultural time, which has powerfully promoted the development of agricultural production.
    Currently, this animal-powered transportation force is concentrating its efforts on serving the "Three Autumns". According to incomplete statistics, more than 60 million catties of fertile soil have been transported from the Gobi Desert, dozens of miles away, to various production teams. Production brigades in remote areas with a serious shortage of livestock, such as the First Brigade of the Third Management District of the Mangshen Commune, have also transported large quantities of fertilizer and other means of production in a timely manner with the support of the management district's animal-powered transportation team.
    In the past two years, agricultural production in Yingjisha County has developed rapidly, with the sown area expanding from less than 300,000 mu in 1958 to more than 400,000 mu now. The demand for fertilizers, pesticides, and production tools has greatly increased, and the sales volume of agricultural and sideline products has also increased significantly. Relying solely on national automobile transportation cannot meet the requirements in a timely manner. In order to solve this problem, the Yingjisha County Committee of the Communist Party of China began this year to lead the people of the county to vigorously develop animal-powered transportation centered on supporting agricultural production. The county rationally arranged manpower and livestock power according to the needs of production and transportation, and organized permanent professional transportation teams owned and operated by the communes (generally accounting for less than 2% of rural transportation capacity), fixed transportation teams owned by production brigades and managed uniformly by management districts, and transportation teams directly organized by production brigades, and established animal-powered transportation management institutions at all levels. Except for the fixed members of the commune-run permanent animal-powered transportation team, the manpower and livestock power of other transportation teams are rationally allocated and used according to the production and transportation needs during the agricultural slack and busy seasons. Various transportation teams also have their own division of labor. Generally, the commune-run permanent transportation team undertakes the transportation tasks to other counties, and the animal-powered transportation teams of the management districts and production brigades undertake the transportation tasks within the county. This not only guarantees the needs of agricultural production, but also fully utilizes the role of rural animal-powered transportation, and better completes the transportation tasks assigned by the state. During the summer grain storage this year, the county transported more than 17 million catties of wheat in just 23 days, fundamentally changing the past situation of relying on national automobile transportation and the support of transportation capacity from other counties, and also supported other counties with animal power. Only the grain transported to the Tashkurgan Tajik Autonomous County on the Pamir Plateau amounted to 100,000 catties. This transportation team has also increased the public accumulation of communes and the income of members. (Attached picture)

### 加强短途运输　促进粮食增产  黑龙江省为“三秋”生产赶造大批车船  新疆英吉沙县公社大队建立畜力运输队

　　加强短途运输　促进粮食增产
    黑龙江省为“三秋”生产赶造大批车船
    新疆英吉沙县公社大队建立畜力运输队
    本报讯　黑龙江省各地工厂企业加紧赶造车、船，支援“三秋”生产，到8月底，已制造出一万二千辆胶轮大车和一万九千吨位的木帆船。
    为了加快制造车辆的速度，许多地区采取了专业工厂制造和公社、非专业厂制造相结合的办法。齐齐哈尔地区就有三十一个单位担负制造大车的任务。合江地区在扩大现有船厂造船能力的同时，发动沿江河各县、社大造木帆船，全区已有九处造船基地。从4月份以来，已造出八千八百多吨位的各种船只。
    各承担制造车船任务的工厂为了少用材料更多更好地完成任务，采取了大搞产品革命，广开材料来源等措施。富锦县造船厂采用“因材加钉”的办法，每吨船位节约了五公斤钢材。
    本报乌鲁木齐25日电　新疆维吾尔自治区英吉沙县根据农业生产发展的新形势和当地的具体条件，依靠群众大搞畜力运输。目前，全县五个人民公社共建立了社办畜力运输队五个，管理区组织的畜力运输队九十一个，生产大队组织的畜力运输队四十五个；参加运输的各种车辆和牲畜都比去年增加很多。全县已经组成了一支强大的为农业生产服务的畜力运输队伍。有了这支运输队伍，在不依靠国家汽车运输的情况下，作到了物资运输不误农时，有力地促进了农业生产的发展。
    现在，这支畜力运输队伍正在集中力量为“三秋”服务。据不完全统计，仅是从几十里外的戈壁滩上就为各生产队拉运了六千多万斤肥土。芒申公社三管理区一大队等处在边远地区、畜力十分缺乏的生产大队，在管理区畜力运输队的支援下，也及时运送了大批肥料等生产资料。
    近两年来，英吉沙县的农业生产发展很快，播种面积从1958年的不到三十万亩扩大到现在的四十多万亩，化肥、农药、生产工具等的需要量大大增加，农副产品的销售量也增长很多。仅是依靠国家的汽车运输，就不能及时满足要求。中共英吉沙县委为了解决这一问题，从今年一开始，便领导全县人民大搞以支持农业生产为中心的畜力运输。全县根据生产和运输的需要，合理安排了人力、畜力，分别组织了社有社营的常年专业运输队
  （一般占不到农村运力的2％）、生产大队所有并由管理区统一经营的固定运输队，以及生产大队直接组织的运输队，并且层层建立了畜力运输管理机构。除社办的常年畜力运输队成员固定外，其他运输队的人力、畜力按照农闲、农忙时的生产和运输需要合理分配使用。各种运输队也有所分工。一般是社办的常年运输队担负到外县的运输任务，管理区和生产大队的畜力运输队担负县内的运输任务。这样既保证了农业生产的需要，又充分发挥了农村畜力运输的作用，更好地完成了国家分配的运输任务。今年夏粮入仓时，全县仅用二十三天就运送了一千七百多万斤小麦，不但根本上改变了过去依靠国家汽车运输和外县运力支援的状况，还以畜力支援了外县。仅给帕米尔高原上的塔什库尔干塔吉克自治县运的粮食，就有十万斤。这支运输队伍也增加了公社的公共积累和社员收入。（附图片）
