    5. On this day, the salespersons came to the Tianhong Electrical Appliance Factory. At that time, all the workers in the factory were carrying out a cross-year competition campaign. The staff were highly motivated and wanted to complete the annual task 25 days ahead of schedule. To express their determination, they had already collected the high-yield flag for completing the task ahead of schedule.
    6. The salespersons immediately proposed: "As long as production steadily increases, we are willing to break our backs for the workers!" They sent rich pork rib soup to the night shift workers, who called it "motivation soup." They completed the production task 27 days ahead of schedule, preserving the red flag.
    7. In order to more deeply organize people's economic life, ensure that the labor force eats well, saves money, and has nutrition, the store's Party branch formed a "three-member integrated" investigation and research organization consisting of salespersons, factory cooks, and health doctors to deeply understand the workers' dietary situation in the factory.
    8. The store has made great achievements in inspiring workers' enthusiasm for production. After some factories overfulfilled their tasks, when they went to the district and municipal committees to report the good news with gongs and drums, they made a special detour to the Guangfu Road store to thank the store staff.

    5、这天，售货员们来到了天虹电器厂。当时全厂工人正在开展跨年竞赛运动。职工们干劲冲天，要提前二十五天完成全年任务，为了表示决心，他们事先就领来了提前完成任务的高产旗。
    6、售货员们马上提出：“只要生产步步高，愿为工人折断腰！”他们为夜班工人送上丰美的排骨汤来，工人们把它叫作“干劲汤”。提前二十七天完成了生产任务，保住了红旗。
    7、商店党支部为了更深入地组织人民经济生活，让劳动大军吃好、吃省，还要有营养，于是组成售货员、工厂炊事员和保健大夫的“三员一体”调查研究组织，深入工厂了解工人的饮食情况。
    8、商店在鼓舞工人生产热情方面有很大成绩。有些工厂超额完成任务后，敲锣打鼓地去区委、市委报喜时，特地绕到光复道商店门前，向商店职工道谢。
