　　Yan'an Style Radiates Splendor
　　Wang Lao Jiu

　　The sky is high, the autumn wind is refreshing, the eight hundred li of Qinchuan are bathed in sunshine, foxtail millet meets the sky, cotton bolls are abundant, a vast expanse of green ocean.
　　In the commune fields, everyone is busy, delivering manure and weeding noisily, the red flag flutters in the blue sky, songs resound throughout the fields.
　　Men and women compete like fierce tigers, with the momentum of the Red Army fighting Chiang Kai-shek.
　　Every commune member's heart blossoms, smiling and asking which village the guest is from?
　　Post office, store and school, want to use farmland to write poems.
　　"Self-reliance" keeps spring ever-present, "ample food and clothing" brings fragrant flowers.
　　Chairman Mao's good upbringing, Yan'an style radiates splendor.
　　Strive to increase production of ten thousand dan of grain, build the motherland more brilliantly!
　　The whole people are determined to become rich and strong, communism is promising;
　　All trades and professions hold hands, the giant dragon soars for thousands of miles!

　　延安作风放霞光
　　王老九蓝天高，秋风爽，八百里秦川铺阳光，糜谷接天棉桃繁，茫茫一片绿海洋。公社田里人人忙，送粪除草闹嚷嚷，红旗飘飘拂青天，漫川遍野歌声扬。男女赛过猛虎将，势如红军打老蒋。社员个个心花放，笑问客住哪个庄？邮局商店并学校，要用农田写诗章。“自己动手”春常在，“丰衣足食”百花香。毛主席的好教养，延安作风放霞光。努力增产万担粮，建设祖国多辉煌！全民发愤图富强，共产主义有指望；各行各业手拉手，巨龙腾空万里翔！
