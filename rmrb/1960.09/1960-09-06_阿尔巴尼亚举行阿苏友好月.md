Xinhua News Agency, Tirana, 4th — The annual Albanian-Soviet Friendship Month began on September 1st throughout Albania. Mass rallies were held in the capital, Tirana, and major cities.

　　Kabo, member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Albanian Labor Party and Chairman of the Albanian-Soviet Friendship Association, and Gubin, head of the Soviet-Albanian Friendship Association delegation who came to participate in the Friendship Month activities, spoke at the mass rally held in Tirana.

　　Kabo said that the Albanian people cherish the friendship between the Albanian and Soviet peoples like the pupils of their eyes, and relentlessly expose the warmongering imperialists headed by US imperialism and their servants—all kinds of enemies of Marxism-Leninism, especially the Yugoslav revisionists who try every possible means to undermine the unity of the socialist camp and serve imperialism.

　　Kabo said that the Albanian Labor Party has been and will always fight to defend the purity of Marxist-Leninist ideology, to further consolidate the unity of the socialist camp, and to strengthen the friendship between the Albanian people and the people of the Soviet Union and other socialist countries.

　　Kabo then pointed out that the socialist camp is constantly consolidating, while the imperialist camp is heading for decline. Final victory belongs to the socialist camp and to the immortal Marxist-Leninist ideology. However, this should not make us lower our guard. Imperialism, especially US imperialism, is always the root cause of aggressive war, which is determined by its nature. Therefore, we must be vigilant, always be prepared, and mobilize the people to tie the hands and feet of the warmongers. Gubin, head of the Soviet-Albanian Friendship Association delegation, said in his speech that our strength lies in unity. The solid foundation of this unity is Marxist-Leninist ideology and the principles of proletarian internationalism. He added that in order to resist the attacks of imperialist aggressive forces, our unity is even more indispensable.

　　Gubin said that Albania can be regarded as a fighting member in this great collective of socialist countries, and Albania has made its own contribution to the struggle of the socialist camp for the victory of communism and for world peace.

    阿尔巴尼亚举行阿苏友好月
    新华社地拉那4日电　一年一度的阿苏友好月9月1日在阿尔巴尼亚全国各地开始。首都地拉那和各大城镇都举行了群众大会。
    阿尔巴尼亚劳动党中央政治局委员、阿苏友好协会主席卡博和前来参加友好月活动的苏阿友好协会代表团团长古宾，在地拉那举行的群众大会上讲了话。
    卡博说，阿尔巴尼亚人民像保护眼珠一样保护阿苏两国人民间的友谊，并无情地揭露以美帝国主义为首的好战的帝国主义和他们的仆从——各色各样的马克思列宁主义的敌人，特别是千方百计地企图破坏社会主义阵营团结、并为帝国主义效劳的南斯拉夫修正主义者。
    卡博说，阿尔巴尼亚劳动党曾经并将永远为保卫马克思列宁主义思想的纯洁性，为进一步巩固社会主义阵营的团结，为加强阿尔巴尼亚人民同苏联以及其他社会主义各国人民的友谊而斗争。
    卡博接着指出，社会主义阵营正在不断巩固，而帝国主义阵营正在走向没落。最后胜利是属于社会主义阵营，属于不朽的马克思列宁主义思想的。但是，这不应该使我们不提高警惕。帝国主义，特别是美帝国主义永远是侵略战争的根源，这是它的本质所决定的。因此，我们必须提高警惕，永远准备着，并动员人民束缚住战争贩子的手脚。苏阿友好协会代表团团长古宾在讲话中说，我们的力量在于团结。这种团结的巩固基础就是马克思列宁主义思想和无产阶级国际主义原则。他又说，为了抵御帝国主义侵略势力的进攻，我们的团结就更加不可缺少。
    古宾说，阿尔巴尼亚在这个社会主义各国的大集体中堪称为战斗的一员，阿尔巴尼亚在社会主义阵营争取共产主义胜利、争取世界和平的斗争中作出了自己的贡献。
