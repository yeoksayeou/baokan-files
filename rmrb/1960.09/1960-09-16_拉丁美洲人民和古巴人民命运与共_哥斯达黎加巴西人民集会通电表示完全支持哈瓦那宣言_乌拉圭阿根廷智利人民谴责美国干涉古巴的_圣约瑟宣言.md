The People of Costa Rica and Brazil Held Rallies and Sent Telegrams Expressing Full Support for the Havana Declaration. The People of Uruguay, Argentina, and Chile Condemn the U.S. Interference in Cuba's "Declaration of San José"

(Comprehensive Report) The people of various Latin American countries are supporting the Cuban Revolution and the Havana Declaration and opposing the United States' interference in Cuba and the "Declaration of San José" passed by the Organization of American States conference manipulated by it, through various means such as rallies, telegrams, statements, and leaflet distribution.

Costa Rica
    A mass rally was held on the evening of the 5th in a workers' residential center in San José, the capital of Costa Rica. Manuel Mora, General Secretary of the People's Vanguard Party, stated in his speech that he fully supported the Havana Declaration and condemned the subservient policies of some Latin American governments toward U.S. imperialism.
    He pointed out that the strength of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union is an obstacle to U.S. imperialist aggression.
    The Costa Rican Women's League decided to send a telegram to Cuban women in support of the Havana Declaration. The Costa Rican General Confederation of Workers decided to establish committees to defend the Cuban Revolution in various labor centers and to urge workers to hold conferences to pass the Havana Declaration. The Association of Friends of the Cuban Revolution will also convene a people's conference in support of the Havana Declaration.

Brazil
    The First National Congress of the Brazilian Nationalist Movement concluded in Rio de Janeiro on the 12th after three days of meetings.
    After a congratulatory telegram from the Cuban "July 26th" Movement was read at the closing meeting, the congress's reply telegram was adopted. The reply stated that the revolutionary cause of Cuba is also the cause of the people of all underdeveloped countries. The reply expressed non-recognition of the "Declaration of San José" and pointed out that this declaration contains the conspiracies of colonialism, which is in its death throes.
    Klay de Araújo, Minister of Labor of the state of Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil, recently believed that the Havana Declaration is the most significant political event in Latin America this century. He said that Latin American countries have a responsibility to expand the prestige of the Cuban Revolution in order to stop imperialist attempts at aggression. He pointed out that defending the Cuban Revolution is closely linked to defending world peace. Klay de Araújo also criticized the Brazilian delegation's position at the San José Conference of American Foreign Ministers.
    The National Student Union of Brazil recently sent a telegram to the Cuban Prime Minister, expressing full support for the Havana Declaration adopted by the Cuban People's National Congress held on the 2nd.

Uruguay
    According to a Latin American News Agency report on the 12th, Arturo Larroca, leader of the Unified Union of Port Management of Uruguay, expressed support for the Havana Declaration adopted by the Cuban People's National Congress. He pointed out that Uruguayan workers support Cuba with strike actions, demonstrating that the fate of Cuba is the fate of all Latin America. Arturo Larroca also expressed support for Cuba's decision to establish diplomatic relations with the People's Republic of China.
    The Uruguayan public recently held a rally in the auditorium of the National University in the capital to support Cuba and condemn the "Declaration of San José." Communist Member of Parliament Enrique Rodriguez said that the country of José Martí is now a shining example for Latin American countries.

Argentina
    Argentina is launching a "struggle for national liberation" throughout the country, with the main contents being support for the Cuban Revolution, defense of Argentina's national resources, opposition to U.S. military bases, and demands for democratic freedom.
    Despite the repressive measures taken by the Argentine authorities, they have not been able to prevent Argentine youth from organizing dozens of mass activities every day in cities, rural areas, and schools. They use train stations, cinemas, parking lots, stadiums, schools, and other places where crowds gather to hold lightning rallies, publicize the achievements of the Cuban Revolution to the masses, and distribute leaflets. At the same time, they also post propaganda posters on the streets. It is estimated that a total of 500 large propaganda posters have been posted in the capital, and more than 50,000 leaflets protesting the establishment of a U.S. military base in Ezeiza have been distributed.
    The Argentine weekly "Acción" published the full text of the Havana Declaration adopted by the Cuban People's National Congress. A brief commentary published by the weekly at the same time said that this declaration is "a response to the 'Declaration of San José' made by one million people representing the Cuban people through direct consultation."

Chile
    Chilean Socialist Senator Alejandro Chelen Rojas severely condemned the resolution of the San José Foreign Ministers Conference to interfere in Cuba in the Senate on the 7th. He said that all of Latin America recognizes that their common enemy is the Wall Street group of the United States. This group "operates from Mexico to our painful and plundered republic of Chile, through its stewards and lackeys in various governments." Rojas presented some documents proving imperialism's plunder in the Americas. Rojas emphasized, "If imperialism interferes in Cuba, Castro's prediction will come true: the Andes Mountains will become the Sierra Maestra of Latin America, and millions of warriors will descend from there to fight for freedom and true democracy."

    哥斯达黎加巴西人民集会通电表示完全支持哈瓦那宣言  乌拉圭阿根廷智利人民谴责美国干涉古巴的“圣约瑟宣言”
    本报综合报道　拉丁美洲各国人民正在以集会、通电、发表声明和散发传单等各种方式，支持古巴革命和哈瓦那宣言，反对美国干涉古巴和它所操纵的美洲国家组织会议通过的“圣约瑟宣言”。	哥斯达黎加
    在哥斯达黎加首都圣约瑟的工人居住中心，5日晚举行了群众集会。人民先锋党总书记曼努埃尔·莫拉在会上的发言中表示完全支持哈瓦那宣言，并谴责一些拉丁美洲国家政府对美帝国主义采取屈从的政策。
    他指出，以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的力量是美帝国主义进行侵略的障碍。
    哥斯达黎加妇女联盟决定致电古巴妇女，支持哈瓦那宣言。哥斯达黎加总工会决定在各劳动中心建立保卫古巴革命委员会，并促使工人举行大会通过哈瓦那宣言。古巴革命之友协会也将召集支持哈瓦那宣言的人民大会。	巴　西
    巴西民族主义者运动第一次全国代表大会在举行了三天会议之后，12日在里约热内卢闭幕。
    在闭幕会议上宣读了古巴“七月二十六日”运动发来的贺电之后通过大会的复电。复电说，古巴的革命事业也就是所有不发达国家人民的事业。复电表示不承认“圣约瑟宣言”，并且指出，这项宣言包藏着正在作垂死挣扎的殖民主义的阴谋。
    巴西南里约格朗德州劳工部长克拉伊·德阿劳若日前认为，哈瓦那宣言是拉丁美洲本世纪以来最重大的政治事件。他说，拉丁美洲各国有责任扩大古巴革命的威望，以便制止帝国主义的侵略企图。他指出，保卫古巴革命与保卫世界和平有密切的联系。克拉伊·德阿劳若还批评了巴西代表团在圣约瑟美洲外长会议上的立场。
    巴西全国学生联合会最近致电古巴总理，表示完全支持2日举行的古巴人民全国大会所通过的哈瓦那宣言。	乌拉圭
    据拉丁美洲通讯社12日报道，乌拉圭全国港口管理统一工会领导人阿图罗·拉罗卡表示支持古巴人民全国大会通过的哈瓦那宣言。他指出，乌拉圭工人以罢工行动支持古巴，以此表明古巴的命运就是全拉丁美洲的命运。阿图罗·拉罗卡并且表示支持古巴和中华人民共和国建交的决定。
    乌拉圭公众最近在首都国立大学的会议厅举行了声援古巴谴责“圣约瑟宣言”的集会。共产党议员恩里克·罗德里格斯说，何塞·马蒂的国家现在是拉丁美洲国家光辉的榜样。	阿　根　廷
    阿根廷全国各地正在展开以支持古巴革命、保卫阿根廷民族资源、反对美国军事基地和要求民主自由为主要内容的“争取民族解放斗争活动”。
    尽管阿根廷当局采取了镇压措施，但是并没有能阻止阿根廷青年每天在城市、农村和学校里组织数十起群众性活动。他们利用火车站、电影院、停车场、运动场、学校等群众集中的地方，举行闪电集会，向群众宣传古巴革命的成就，散发传单，同时还在街上张贴宣传画。据估计，在首都共张贴了五百幅大型宣传画，散发了五万多张抗议美国在埃塞伊萨设立军事基地的传单。
    阿根廷“行动”周刊发表了古巴人民全国大会通过的哈瓦那宣言的全文。这家周刊同时发表的简短评论说，这项宣言是“一百万人代表古巴人民通过直接协商对‘圣约瑟宣言’所做的回答”。	智　利
    智利社会党参议员亚历杭德罗·切伦·罗哈斯7日在参议院严厉谴责圣约瑟外长会议干涉古巴的决议。他说，整个拉丁美洲都认清了他们的共同敌人是美国的华尔街集团。这一集团“从墨西哥直到我们的痛苦的受掠夺的共和国智利，通过它在各国政府内的大管家和它的走卒进行活动”。罗哈斯提出了一些文件证明了帝国主义在美洲的掠夺。罗哈斯强调说，“假如帝国主义干涉古巴，卡斯特罗的预言将会成为现实：安达斯山脉将变为拉丁美洲的马埃斯特腊山，千万战士将从那里下来争取自由和真正的民主。”
