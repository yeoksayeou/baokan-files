Xinhua News Agency, 20th - According to a report from the Near East and Far East News Agency published in the "Hindustan Standard," American monopoly capital has recently been attempting to use Indian rupees obtained from the sale of large quantities of "surplus" grain to India to vigorously penetrate the Indian economy.

The newspaper said that more American companies are now requesting to invest in India or "cooperate" with Indian capital to manufacture various products than at any other time. There is an increasing number of applications to the U.S. Export-Import Bank, which is responsible for handling the repayment of Indian rupees to the United States, requesting to use Indian rupees.

The newspaper said that to date, the U.S. Export-Import Bank has already advanced rupees worth 83 million U.S. dollars to American companies and partners in India. Currently, applications requesting loans of more than 117 million U.S. dollars are still under review.

The report also revealed that not long ago, some American companies had approached Indian Food Minister Patil, expressing their intention to invest in the construction of a series of warehouses in India to store a large portion of the grain provided by the United States to India under the surplus grain agreement signed by the United States and India in May this year. And these American companies' investments are precisely using the Indian rupees repaid to the United States by the Indian government.

　　利用出售“剩余”粮食所得作为投资
　　美国资本加紧渗入印度
    新华社20日讯　据“印度斯坦旗报”刊载近东远东通讯社的一则消息说，美国垄断资本最近企图利用美国向印度出售大量“剩余”粮食所得到的印度卢比，大力打入印度经济。
    这家报纸说，现在要求向印度投资或者同印度资本“合作”制造各种产品的美国公司比任何时期都多。向负责处理偿还美国的印度卢比的美国进出口银行要求利用印度卢比的申请愈来愈多。
    报纸说，到目前为止，美国进出口银行已经给在印度的美国公司和合伙人预支了价值八千三百万美元的卢比。目前，还有要求贷给总数一亿一千七百万美元以上的卢比的申请尚待审查。
    这则消息还透露，不久以前，一些美国公司已经向印度粮食部长帕蒂尔提出，表示要在印度投资修建一系列的仓库，来贮存根据今年5月美国和印度签订的剩余粮食协定美国向印度提供的粮食中的一大部分。而这些美国公司的投资，正是用的印度政府偿还给美国的卢比。
