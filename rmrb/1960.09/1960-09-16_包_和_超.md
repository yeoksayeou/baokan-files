    “Bao” and “Chao”	Mu Yi
    In many people's communes, the "Three Guarantees" (guaranteed output, guaranteed work, and guaranteed cost) system has deeply penetrated the masses, and the "Three Supers" (super area, super yield, super total output) movement has vigorously sprung up.

    The main goal of "Three Guarantees" and "Three Supers" is to increase production, which also includes saving manpower, materials, and financial resources. "Three Guarantees" plus "Three Supers" is one of the best organizational forms for carrying out the increase production and conservation campaign on the agricultural front, and it is also one of the best ways for rural people's communes to implement the Party's mass line in production management, labor management, and financial management.
      "Guarantee it!" This is first and foremost a heroic spirit. The task of "guaranteeing it" is by no means a task that can be accomplished without much effort. To determine the guaranteed output targets, we must have a spirit of positive initiative, we must see the new favorable conditions, and we must meet the requirements of "vigorously developing agriculture and vigorously developing grain."

    "Guarantee it!" This is also a spirit of seeking truth. The task of "guaranteeing it" must be a task that can be guaranteed to be completed under normal natural conditions. To determine the guaranteed output targets, we must adopt a realistic attitude, we must earnestly summarize past experience, and we must have sufficient measures to ensure the realization of the targets.

    We are by no means "guaranteeing" for the sake of "guaranteeing," but "guaranteeing" for the sake of "surpassing." Therefore, on the one hand, we must "guarantee" with the spirit of "surpassing"; on the other hand, we must also "guarantee" that there is "production to surpass." If the guaranteed output targets are too low or too high, the "Three Guarantees" will lose their due power.

    How to draw this line of "not too low, not too high"? The only way is to mobilize the masses to discuss it. This line cannot be reached without boosting morale, and it can be surpassed by boosting morale. It roughly corresponds to the actual output this summer; in areas that suffered disaster and reduced production this year, it roughly corresponds to the average summer harvest output of the past three years. In each commune and each production team, the objective conditions for the production of autumn-sown crops this year have more or less changed, and the way to draw this line will be different. However, each commune and each production team has an appropriate line that should be mobilized by the masses to find it.

    "Three Guarantees" and "Three Supers" is an organizational form of the mass movement led by the Party, and it is an organizational form that combines political work and economic work. If they are separated from the leadership of the Party, they will lose their soul; if they are separated from the enthusiasm, initiative, and creativity of the masses, they will become empty shells without flesh and blood. We must use the Party's guidelines, the Party's policies, the Party's thoughts, and the Party's language to mobilize the commune members. As long as we explain the significance of "vigorously developing agriculture and vigorously developing grain" to the masses, explain the Party's guidelines and policies to the masses, and analyze the subjective and objective conditions clearly with the masses, the guaranteed output targets will definitely be practical, and we will definitely be able to closely combine revolutionary enthusiasm and scientific spirit. Be down-to-earth and full of energy. Facts have proved that wherever the masses are fully mobilized to discuss the "Three Guarantees" plan, not only are the targets set both actively and reliably, but also a "Three Supers" movement is immediately launched, and everyone is determined to strive for a summer harvest next year that is much better than any previous year. The deeper the roots of the "Three Guarantees" are in the masses, the more luxuriant the branches and leaves of the "Three Supers" will grow, and the more flowers and fruits will be obtained in the future.

    "Three Guarantees" is to draw a line, and "Three Supers" is to strive to break through this line. Drawing a line is not to limit people's enthusiasm, but to increase people's enthusiasm. This line is like a high jump bar, which is there for people to jump over. We must implement the "Three Guarantees" on the most solid foundation under the guidance of the "Three Supers" ideology, and we must also immediately launch a vigorous "Three Supers" movement on the basis of the implementation of the "Three Guarantees."

### “包”和“超”

    “包”和“超”	木易
    在许多人民公社里，“三包”（包产、包工、包成本）制度深入群众，“三超”（超面积、超单产、超总产）运动勃然而起。
    “三包”、“三超”的主要目标是增产，其中又包含着节约人力、物力、财力的内容。“三包”加“三超”，是农业战线上开展增产节约运动的最好的组织形式之一，也是农村人民公社在生产管理、劳动管理、财务管理上贯彻执行党的群众路线的最好的方式之一。
      “包下来！”这首先是一种英雄气概。“包下来”的任务，决不是不费多大力气就能完成的任务。确定包产指标，必须有积极进取的精神，必须看到新的有利条件，必须合乎“大办农业、大办粮食”的要求。
    “包下来！”这同时又是一种求实精神。“包下来”的任务，必须是在一般的自然条件下保证能够完成的任务。确定包产指标，必须抱着实事求是的态度，必须认真总结过去的经验，必须有充分的措施保证指标的实现。
    我们决不是为“包”而“包”，而是为“超”而“包”。因此，一方面，必须用“超”的精神来“包”；另方面，也必须“包”得“有产可超”。包产指标太低或太高，都会使“三包”失去它应有的力量。
    这个“不低不高”的一道线怎样划？唯一的办法：发动群众讨论。这条线，不鼓干劲就达不到，鼓足干劲就能超过。它大体上相当于今年夏季的实际产量；在今年受灾减产的地区大体上相当于过去三年的夏收平均产量。在各个公社、各个生产队，今年秋播作物生产的客观条件有或大或小的变化，这条线的划法会有所不同。可是，每个公社、每个生产队都有一条适当的线，应该发动群众，把它找出来。
    “三包”“三超”是党领导的群众运动的一种组织形式，是政治工作和经济工作结合起来的一种组织形式。如果离开党的领导，它们就会失掉灵魂；如果离开了群众的积极性、主动性、创造性，它们就会成为没有血肉的空壳子。必须用党的方针、党的政策、党的思想、党的语言去发动社员群众。只要把“大办农业、大办粮食”的意义对群众讲清楚，把党的方针、政策对群众讲清楚，同群众在一起把主观条件、客观条件分析清楚，包产指标就一定能够切合实际，一定能把革命热情和科学精神密切地结合起来。脚踏实地，干劲冲天。事实证明，凡是充分发动群众讨论“三包”计划的地方，不但指标订得既积极又可靠，而且立即掀起了“三超”运动，人人下定决心争取明年获得一个比以往任何一年都好得多的夏收。“三包”的根在群众中扎得越深，“三超”的枝叶就长得越茂，将来得到的花果也就越多。
    “三包”是划一道线，“三超”是力求突破这一道线。划一道线不是为了限制人们的积极性，而是为了提高人们的积极性。这一道线等于跳高的横竿，它横在那里是为了人们跳越过去。要在“三超”的思想指导下把“三包”落实在最坚实的基础上，也要在“三包”落实的基础上立即掀起蓬蓬勃勃的“三超”运动。
