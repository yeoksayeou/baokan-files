    On the Winter Wheat Sowing Period Based on This Year's Meteorological Conditions	Fu Yonggang
    The winter wheat sowing season is approaching. How to seize the opportunity and sow in a timely manner based on the local meteorological characteristics is of great significance for ensuring a bumper harvest of winter wheat next year.
    Timely sowing can make full use of natural conditions, promote appropriate tillering in wheat fields before winter, and ensure that wheat seedlings are strong and overwinter safely. If sowing is too early, due to the high temperature, it is not only easy to cause excessive growth and consume too much nutrients, but also winter wheat with strong spring characteristics may pass through the vernalization stage before winter and begin to joint, weakening its winter hardiness and causing death. In some areas, it is also easy to be infected with rust. If sowing is too late, there will be few or no tillers before winter, and the root system will not be strong, making it vulnerable to cold damage. Such wheat seedlings will recover slowly in the second spring, reducing their ability to resist natural disasters and easily reducing yields. The masses have rich experience in the suitable sowing period for winter wheat. For example, there is a folk saying in North China: "Sow wheat during the Autumn Equinox, early during White Dew, late during Cold Dew"; in the wheat areas south of the Yangtze River, there is a saying that "Sow rapeseed during Cold Dew and wheat during Frost's Descent." If winter wheat can grow three to five tillers before winter, it will be conducive to overwintering and obtaining a bumper harvest. According to the experience of the masses, combined with the analysis of meteorological data and experimental research data, when the temperature is between 17 and 15 degrees Celsius, and the soil moisture is moderate during the sowing period (the ten-day average temperature in North China drops to about 3 degrees Celsius, and winter wheat stops growing), it can be guaranteed that there will be three to five tillers before winter.
    At the time of sowing, the generally suitable soil moisture (percentage of water to dry soil weight) is 17%-20% in sandy loam soil, which is about 60%-80% of the field water holding capacity. If the soil is too dry, it will be difficult to emerge quickly after sowing, and it will not be possible to ensure that the seedlings are uniform and strong. Most winter wheat areas in China have the characteristics of clear skies and refreshing air in autumn. Except for Sichuan, the rainfall in other areas is less in autumn, and autumn drought often occurs, causing difficulties in autumn sowing. This year, the rainfall in the vast areas south of the Yellow River and north of the middle reaches of the Yangtze River in August was less than the same period in previous years, and some areas have experienced severe drought, which directly affects the growth and development of autumn crops and the smooth progress of autumn plowing. Although the drought in the northern part of the Huai River Basin has been alleviated, these areas may still have little rain in September and October, and it is difficult to ensure sufficient soil moisture for smooth autumn sowing. Therefore, attention should be paid to storing water and preserving soil moisture as early as possible, and specific analysis of soil moisture should be made when arranging the sowing period, and effective measures should be taken as soon as possible to make full use of possible irrigation conditions. When preparing the land, it should be plowed and harrowed at the same time to reduce water consumption. For "stubble land," it is necessary to plow and plant as soon as it is harvested, and sow by seizing soil moisture.
    Since April this year, the temperature in vast areas of China has been lower than the same period in previous years for a long time; the alleviation of spring drought in some areas of North China and Northwest China was too late, which delayed the sowing period of some summer crops. These two factors will affect the delayed maturity and harvest of autumn crops. In addition, this year's summer sowing area is large, and a large amount of land for autumn sowing is "stubble land," which makes the task of autumn harvesting and autumn sowing heavy and labor is tight. These are all unfavorable factors for timely sowing of winter wheat. In order to solve this contradiction, in addition to making early preparations for autumn harvesting and autumn sowing, we can also find ways to promote the early maturity of previous crops, reduce soil moisture, apply potassium fertilizer, and for crops such as cotton, we can also consider using the method of pushing stalks and merging ridges to improve ventilation and light transmission, increase ground temperature, and reduce humidity between plants. Generally, cereal crops have after-ripening effects, and they can be harvested in advance when they are 80% ripe, and threshed after being spread out for a few days. This can not only harvest in advance, but also not reduce yield.
    According to the practice in various places and the agricultural meteorological conditions considered during sowing, the suitable sowing period for winter wheat in various parts of China is roughly as follows:
    Around mid-September in northern Hebei, central Shanxi, northern Shaanxi, most of Ningxia, the Hexi Corridor of Gansu, and northern Xinjiang; around late September in central Hebei, Shandong Peninsula, southern Shanxi, and southern Xinjiang; from the end of September to the beginning of October in southern Hebei, most of Shandong, northern Henan, and Guanzhong of Shaanxi; in the upper and middle ten days of October in the northern part of the Huai River Basin; in the middle and lower ten days of October in the area between the Huai River and the Yangtze River and the Yunnan-Guizhou Plateau; from the end of October to the middle of November in the Sichuan Basin, southern Guizhou, and southern Jiangnan; dry land in the Fujian and Guangdong areas can be sown in the lower ten days of October, and paddy fields can be sown in the upper ten days of November.
    It is estimated that the temperature in most parts of China in October this year will be higher than the same period in previous years, but the temperature in November will be lower. This shows that autumn may end a little earlier this year, and winter may come earlier accordingly. If winter comes early, then the period when winter wheat in the north begins to stop growing in winter and when tillering ends before winter will also be advanced accordingly. Therefore, in order to strive for winter wheat to have an appropriate number of tillers before winter and enhance cold resistance, the sowing period in various places north of the Yangtze River should strive not to be later than the aforementioned suitable sowing period in each area in previous years. If the sowing is slightly late and the soil moisture is good, the winter wheat can be treated with germination before sowing. However, when the soil moisture is not good, this method should not be used, and efforts should be made to sow drought-resistant crops.
    For late-sown wheat fields, the amount of sowing can be appropriately increased. After emergence, field management should be strengthened as soon as possible, and human manure or other fast-acting nitrogen fertilizers should be applied to promote early tillering and more tillering, so as to ensure that the seedlings are uniform and strong before winter.
    In order to rationally arrange the sowing period for different terrains, soils, and soil moisture, efforts should be made to sow those sections with slow growth first, such as highlands, shady slopes, barren and slightly poor soil moisture land. In low-lying areas with excessive soil moisture, the mortality rate of wheat seedlings in winter is often high, and attention should be paid to ditching and drainage as soon as possible to ensure timely sowing and reduce the mortality rate of overwintering.
    China's winter wheat area is vast and the meteorological conditions are complex. In order to be able to carefully determine this year's winter wheat sowing period according to the characteristics of various places, agricultural production units in various places should pay attention to contacting local meteorological service stations and meteorological service outposts in communes to promote them to do a good job in forecasting and reporting on soil moisture and meteorological conditions for autumn harvesting and autumn sowing, and strive for timely winter wheat sowing.

    从今年的气象条件看冬小麦播种期	服永纲
    冬小麦播种季节到来了。如何结合各地气象特点，抓住时机，适时播种，对保证明年冬小麦的丰产丰收，有着重大的意义。
    适时播种，能充分利用自然条件，促进麦田在冬前适当分蘖，保证麦苗健壮、安全越冬。过早播种，由于气温高，不仅易于形成陡长，过多消耗养分，春性较强的冬小麦还可能在冬前通过春化阶段，开始拔节，减弱冬季抗寒能力，引起死亡，有的地区还容易感染锈病。过晚播种，冬前分蘖少或不分蘖，根系不壮，很容易受寒害，这样的麦苗到了第二年春季恢复生长较慢，抵抗自然灾害能力降低，极易减产。冬小麦的适宜播种期，群众有丰富的经验。如华北地区农谚：“白露早，寒露迟，秋分麦子正当时”；长江以南的麦区则流传有“寒露油菜，霜降麦”等说法。冬小麦在冬前如能长出三至五个分蘖就有利于越冬和获得丰产。根据群众的经验，结合气象资料和试验研究资料分析的结果，当气温在摄氏十七至十五度时播种，在冬季停止生长期间（华北地区旬平均气温降至摄氏三度左右，冬小麦即停止生长），土壤水分适中，即能保证冬前具有三至五个分蘖。
    播种时，一般适宜的土壤湿度（水分对干土重的百分比）在沙壤土为17％—20％，以田间持水量计算，约为60％—80％较适宜。土壤太干，播后难以很快出苗，不能保证苗齐苗壮。我国大部分冬麦地区具有秋高气爽的特点，除四川地区外，其余地区秋季降雨均少，不少地区往往发生秋旱，造成秋播困难。今年8月我国黄河下游以南、长江中游以北广大地区降雨均较常年同期为少，有些地区已发生严重的旱象，直接影响大秋作物生长发育和秋耕的顺利进行。目前淮河流域北部旱象虽已解除，但这些地区在9月至10月内可能仍然少雨，墒情难以保证顺利秋播。因此，应注意及早蓄水保墒，在具体安排播种期时还要具体分析墒情，及早采取有效措施，充分利用可能灌溉的条件。整地时应随耕随耧，以减少水分的消耗，对于“赶茬地”要做到随收随耕，随耕随种，抢墒播种。
    今年从4月以来，我国广大地区在长时期内气温都较常年同期低；华北和西北部分地区春旱解除得过晚，使部分夏播作物播种期推迟。这两个因素都将影响秋收作物延迟成熟和收获。再加上今年夏播面积大，秋播的大量土地是“赶茬地”，使得秋收秋种的任务繁重，劳动力紧张。这些都是对冬小麦适时播种的不利因素。为解决这个矛盾，除了及早做好秋收和秋种的准备工作外，还可以设法促进前茬作物早熟，降低土壤水分，追施钾肥，对于棉花等作物，还可考虑采用推株并垅办法，以增进通风透光，提高地温，降低株间湿度。一般禾谷类作物都有后熟作用，可在八成熟的时候提前收割，摊放几天后再行脱粒，这样做既能提前收割，又不致于减产。
    根据各地的实践和播种时所考虑的农业气象条件来看，我国各地冬小麦常年的适宜播种时期大致如下：
    河北北部、山西中部、陕西北部、宁夏大部、甘肃河西走廊以及新疆北部在9月中旬前后；河北中部、山东半岛、山西南部、新疆南部在9月下旬前后；河北南部、山东大部、河南北部、陕西关中约在9月底到10月上旬；淮河流域北部在10月上、中旬；淮河与长江之间地区以及云贵高原约在10月中、下旬；四川盆地、贵州南部和江南南部地区在10月底到11月中旬；闽粤地区旱地可在10月下旬，水田可在11月上旬开始播种。
    据估计，今年我国大部地区10月份气温将较常年同期为高，但11月份气温则较低。这说明今年秋季可能结束得稍早，而冬季则可能相应地提早来临。如果冬季提前来临，那么北方地区冬小麦冬季开始停止生长和冬前结束分蘖的时期也将相应提前。因此，为了争取冬小麦在冬前有适当数量的分蘖并增强抗寒力，长江以北各地的播种期应力争不晚于前述各该地区常年的适宜播种时期。如播种稍晚且地墒较好时，可先对冬麦进行催芽处理后再行播种。但当土壤墒情不好时，不宜采用这个办法，应争取抗旱播种。
    对于晚播的麦田，可适当增加播种量，出苗以后要及早加强田间管理，追施人粪尿或其他速效氮肥，就能促进早分蘖和多分蘖，以保证冬前苗齐苗壮。
    为合理安排不同地形、土壤、墒情的播种期，应争取先播那些生长缓慢的地段，如高地、阴坡地、贫瘠和墒情稍差的土地。低洼、土壤水分过多的地段，冬季麦苗死亡率往往较高，应注意及早开沟排水，保证适时播种和减少越冬的死亡率。
    我国冬麦地区广大，气象条件复杂，为了能按照各地的特点细致地确定今年冬小麦的播种期，各地农业生产单位要注意同当地气象服务台、站及公社气象服务哨联系，促使它们作好秋收、秋种的墒情和气象条件的预报与情报工作，力争冬麦播种适时。
