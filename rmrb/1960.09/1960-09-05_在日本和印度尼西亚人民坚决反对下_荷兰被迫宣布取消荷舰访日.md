Xinhua News Agency, The Hague, September 4th: Following the Japanese government's forced withdrawal of its invitation to the Dutch fleet to "visit" Japan under the firm opposition of the Japanese and Indonesian people, the Dutch Foreign Ministry yesterday issued a helpless statement announcing the cancellation of the "visit." The Dutch Foreign Ministry's statement also complained that "this attitude of the Japanese government is very unusual." The statement announced that Dutch warships would still "visit" the port of French New Caledonia.

  新华社4日讯　海牙消息：在日本政府迫于日本人民和印度尼西亚人民的坚决反对被迫撤回对荷兰舰队“访问”日本的邀请后，荷兰外交部昨天无可奈何地发表一项声明，宣布取消这次“访问”。荷兰外交部的声明还不满地说，“日本政府这一态度是非常不寻常的”。声明宣布，荷兰的军舰仍然要到法属新喀里多尼亚的港口去“访问”。
