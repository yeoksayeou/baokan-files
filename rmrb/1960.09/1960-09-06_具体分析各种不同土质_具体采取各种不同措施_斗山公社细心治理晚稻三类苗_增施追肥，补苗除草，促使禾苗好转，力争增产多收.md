    Doushan Commune Carefully Manages Late Rice Third-Class Seedlings
    Increase Topdressing, Replenish Seedlings, Weed, Promote Better Seedling Growth, and Strive for Increased Production and Harvest
    (Our Newspaper's Dispatch) According to the Southern Daily News: The Doushan Commune in Taishan County, Guangdong Province, has conducted specific analyses of late rice third-class seedlings in various soil types and formulated specific measures. All 1,200 production team leaders and above in the commune are vigorously leading the masses to strengthen the management of third-class seedlings. From August 18th to 28th, the commune mobilized more than 21,000 members daily to strengthen field management of five types of backward fields. More than 16,000 mu were topdressed, accounting for 83% of the backward fields, with a total of 365,000 dan of various fertilizers applied. All fields requiring seedling replenishment were replenished and weeded. Currently, the growth of these seedlings has begun to improve.
    The Doushan Commune planted late rice earlier this year, with sufficient base fertilizer, and most seedlings are growing well. However, through field consultations, evaluations, and inspections, it was found that seedling growth was still uneven. There are 19,500 mu of backward rice fields in the commune, accounting for 17.6% of the late rice area; these backward fields include mountain pit fields, single-crop high-lying fields, remote fields, late-planted ridge fields, and shallow-footed yellow mud bone fields. In order to change the growth of seedlings in these five types of fields, Qi Changcheng, the first secretary of the commune party committee, conducted investigations and research among the masses in the Xizha Brigade. Afterwards he convened a field meeting attended by cadres, experienced farmers, and technicians from major brigades. Through specific analysis, different management measures were determined for the five types of fields. The first category is mountain pit fields, which are mostly acidic and cold, with slow greening after transplanting and less tillering. The decision was made to construct drainage ditches, rust water drainage ditches, and irrigation ditches to thoroughly improve drainage and irrigation work; to topdress three times; to remove grass from field embankments and weeds from the fields, and to control pests and diseases. The second category is single-crop high-lying fields, which are mostly clayey soils with many leaks, lacking fertilizer and water. It was decided to apply 500 jin of green manure, 8 dan of fertilizer from vats, and 400 jin of mixed fertilizer per mu; to remove weeds from embankments and fields; to plug leaks to ensure sufficient fertilizer and water; and to universally replenish seedlings. Special attention should be paid to ensuring full seedling stands in single-crop deep-water fields. The third category is late-planted rice fields, with 20 dan of quick-acting fertilizer applied per mu. The fourth category is remote sandy fields, where it was decided to accumulate and compost 10 dan of green manure locally as topdressing, and to apply 50 jin of lime. The fifth category is shallow-footed yellow mud bone fields, with 30 dan of factory-produced fertilizer and 200 jin of plant ash applied per mu.
    After these measures were formulated, Qi Changcheng, the first secretary of the party committee, went to the most backward Dagang Shedong and Xia Langdong in the Xizha Brigade to implement the method of concentrating leadership, labor, and fertilizer with local cadres and the masses. On August 24th, under the leadership of the party secretary, the Xizha Brigade mobilized 310 people to launch a major attack on 230 mu of backward rice fields in Dagang Shedong, delivering 4,500 dan of fertilizer in one day. Li Nong, a member of the party committee stationed in the Xikeng Brigade, also went deep into the mountain pit fields with the party branch secretary, brigade leader, and more than ten other cadres. After summarizing the experience of the Dongcheng Team in constructing drainage ditches, topdressing three times, and achieving a bumper harvest on 15 mu of mountain pit fields last year, starting on August 25th, they organized 280 members (accounting for more than 80% of the labor force) to carry out ditching and topdressing work on more than 400 mu of backward fields. In three days, they dug 30 ditches and concentrated more than 20,000 dan of fine fertilizer to these backward fields, averaging 60 dan of fertilizer per mu (15 dan of fertilizer from vats, 15 dan of green manure, and 30 dan of miscellaneous local fertilizer). After three days, the seedlings began to turn green, with three to four new shoots growing from each seedling cluster. The Wuxing Brigade, which has more land and less labor, has never topdressed single-crop fields, but now it has also changed its old routine. On the 20th, it concentrated 320 laborers to attack single-crop high-lying fields, and has already fertilized 650 mu (applying 25 dan of mixed fertilizer or 15 dan of fertilizer from vats per mu). Now, each seedling cluster has reached eight effective tillers, with the highest reaching thirteen, and is growing well.
    On August 29th, the commune party committee convened a cadre meeting, visited and summarized the situation and experience of the Wuxing Brigade in attacking backward rice in single-crop high-lying fields and the Xikeng Brigade in attacking backward rice in mountain pit fields, and summarized the experience of the Xizha Brigade in eliminating missing seedlings and ensuring full seedling stands. It was decided to work hard for another ten days to completely eliminate backward seedlings and strive for increased production and harvest in the late rice crop.

    具体分析各种不同土质　具体采取各种不同措施
    斗山公社细心治理晚稻三类苗
    增施追肥，补苗除草，促使禾苗好转，力争增产多收
    本报讯　据南方日报消息：广东省台山县斗山公社对各种不同土质的晚稻三类苗进行具体分析，制定具体措施，全社生产队长以上干部一千二百人都大力领导群众加强管理三类苗。全社从8月18日至28日，每天组织二万一千多名社员，对五种落后田加强田间管理。有一万六千多亩施了追肥，占落后田的83％，共施下各种肥料三十六万五千担。凡要补苗的全部都进行了补苗除草。现在，这些禾苗生势已经开始好转。
    斗山公社今年晚稻插得较早，基肥较足，大多数禾苗生长良好。但是，通过田头会诊，评比检查，发现禾苗生长仍不平衡。全社落后禾有一万九千五百亩，占晚稻面积的17.6％；这些落后田包括山坑田，单造高片田，远路田，迟插秧坎田和浅脚黄泥骨等五种田。为改变这五种田禾苗生长情况，公社党委第一书记祁长城在西栅大队向群众进行调查研究后，召开了有各大队干部、老农、技术员参加的田头会议，通过具体分析，确定了对五种田不同的管理措施。第一类是山坑田，多属反酸冷底，插后回青慢，分蘖少。决定采用开排洪沟、排铁锈水沟、排灌沟，以便彻底做好排灌工作；追肥三次；铲掉田基草、拔掉田草，除治病害虫害。第二类是单造高片田，多属粘质土壤，漏孔多，缺肥缺水。决定每亩下绿肥五百斤、缸肥八担、混合肥四百斤；拔除围基草和田草；要塞好漏孔，做到足肥足水；普遍补苗。对单造深水田特别注意全苗。第三类是迟插秧地，每亩下速效肥二十担。第四类是远路沙质田，决定就地积、沤绿肥十担作为追肥，并加施石灰五十斤。第五类是浅脚黄泥骨田，每亩下厂肥三十担，草木灰二百斤。
    这些措施制订后，党委第一书记祁长城又到西栅大队最落后的大岗蛇洞和下蓢洞中去，同当地干部群众一起实行领导、劳力、肥料三集中的方法。8月24日，西栅大队在党委书记带动下，出动三百一十人，大举围攻大岗蛇洞二百三十亩落后禾，一天送肥四千五百担。驻西坑大队党委委员李浓也和党支书、大队长等十多个干部深入山坑田，总结了东成队去年对十五亩山坑田进行开好排灌沟，追肥三次，获得丰产的经验后，8月25日起组织社员二百八十人（占劳力80％以上），对四百多亩落后田进行开沟和追肥的工作，在三天中开三沟三十条，同时集中二万多担精肥施到这些落后田中去，平均每亩下肥六十担（缸肥十五担，绿肥十五担，土杂肥三十担）。三天后禾苗开始转青，每穴长出新苗三条至四条。地多劳力少的五星大队，历来对单造田不追肥，现在也改变了过去的老常规，在20日集中劳力三百二十人，围攻单造高片田，已施肥六百五十亩（每亩下混合肥二十五担或缸肥十五担）。现在，每穴有效分蘖达到八条，最高的有十三条，生长良好。
    8月29日，公社党委召开了干部会议，参观和总结五星大队在单造高片田、西坑大队在山坑田围歼落后禾的情况和经验，总结了西栅大队消灭缺苗、保证全苗等经验，决定再大干十天，彻底消灭落后苗，争取晚造增产多收。
