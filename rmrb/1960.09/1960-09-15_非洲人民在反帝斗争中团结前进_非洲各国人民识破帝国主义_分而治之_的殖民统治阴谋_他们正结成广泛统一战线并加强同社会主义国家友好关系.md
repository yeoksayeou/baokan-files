The African people, in their struggle for national independence, democratic freedom, and world peace, are increasingly strengthening their unity and cooperation, supporting each other, and responding and coordinating more closely. The idea of forming a broad anti-imperialist united front and treating unity as the most powerful weapon in the struggle against imperialism and colonialism is increasingly taking root.

More and more facts, especially the recent developments in the Congo situation, have made it clearer to the awakened African people that the most insidious means of maintaining its colonial rule long used and still being used by imperialism is "divide and rule." They constantly create discord among the African people, sow dissension, deceive, and divide, using Africans to fight Africans, so that Africans cannot unite to deal with their real enemies, in order to maintain colonial rule. The Western imperialist countries, headed by the United States, while supporting the secessionist groups such as Tshombe in the Congo, are also viciously using the troops of African countries in the "UN forces" as tools for their interference in the internal affairs of the Congo. Congolese Prime Minister Lumumba, at a meeting with diplomatic envoys and journalists on the 10th, had already called on African countries with troops under the command of the "UN forces" to withdraw from the "UN forces" so as not to participate in the conspiracy of the United Nations against the Congolese government and people. The governments of Guinea and the United Arab Republic have successively decided to withdraw their troops from the "UN forces." Prior to this, the African Foreign Ministers' Conference had expressed its support for the demand for the unification of the Congo.

In other struggles, in response to the aggressive conspiracies of imperialism, the African people are also widely and promptly, vigorously supporting and encouraging each other. For example, regarding the heroic Algerian people's struggle for independence, since the beginning of this year, the public and public opinion in African countries have given more extensive and timely support, condemning France's bloody atrocities in Algeria, exposing every new conspiracy of France, and even more forcefully exposing and condemning the US imperialists' support for France's criminal colonial war. The people of many countries have also held protest demonstrations. In order to further support the Algerian people, the Second All-African People's Conference also suggested that African countries send volunteer troops to support the Algerian people's just war. At the beginning of this year, regarding France's testing of atomic devices in the Sahara Desert and the South African Federal Government's brutal massacre of Africans, many African governments issued statements condemning them, and the public and public opinion in African countries simultaneously launched a massive wave of protest. People in various parts of Africa also held protest meetings and mass demonstrations.

In order to strengthen mutual support, African countries more frequently hold meetings to discuss common issues and adopt common action programs. The All-African People's Conference has been held twice, and these two historically significant conferences have promoted the unity of African countries. They have both passed resolutions to strengthen unity in order to strive for national independence for all African people. One of the main slogans of the First All-African People's Conference was "African People Unite." The declaration adopted at the meeting required African independent countries to "provide the maximum assistance by all possible means to the people of dependent countries who are fighting against imperialism and colonialism, so as to enable them to achieve rapid liberation." The Second All-African People's Conference held at the beginning of this year also called on all African people to "strengthen the unity of their ranks in order to conduct a decisive battle for African independence in 1960." The resolution emphasized that "in order to more effectively resist the collusion of imperialists and rapidly liberate the people of all dependent countries from foreign oppression, it is absolutely necessary to unite and unite the strength of all Africans." This conference also suggested that African countries send volunteer troops to support Algeria and called on all African countries to support Algeria. In addition to the All-African People's Conference, in recent years, African countries have also held the Conference of Independent African States, the Emergency Conference of African States and Political Parties, and the recently held Conference of African Foreign Ministers. In the United Nations, African countries have also formed an African group to strengthen cooperation in diplomatic actions.

While strengthening the unity of their own ranks, the African people are also strengthening the unity with all peace-loving forces and anti-imperialist forces in the world, regarding their own struggle as part of the worldwide struggle against imperialism. African countries have been actively participating in the work of the Asian-African People's Solidarity Conference. Guinean President Sekou Toure said at the Second Asian-African People's Solidarity Conference that the unity of the people of Asian and African countries is the best guarantee of our common interests and the most reliable foundation for realizing our aspirations. The African people are also increasingly clearly aware that the US imperialism, as the chieftain of imperialism, is today also the most ferocious enemy of the African people. It supports France's criminal rule and colonial war in Algeria, and attempts to replace old-brand colonialist countries such as Britain, France, and Belgium in Africa. The recent attempt to swallow the Congo is a clear example. Therefore, the African people also regard their own united front for national independence as part of the broad united front of the people of the world against imperialism headed by US imperialism. They have strengthened friendly cooperation with the countries of the socialist camp that most resolutely oppose imperialism. Some newly independent African countries quickly established diplomatic relations with socialist countries and developed friendly cooperative relations. The African people are deeply convinced that, by relying on strengthening their own unity and strengthening the unity with all forces in the world against imperialism, the national independence movement in the whole of Africa will surely overcome various difficulties and move from one victory to another.

    非洲人民在反帝斗争中团结前进
    非洲各国人民识破帝国主义“分而治之”的殖民统治阴谋  他们正结成广泛统一战线并加强同社会主义国家友好关系
    非洲人民在争取民族独立、民主自由和世界和平的斗争中，正日益加强他们之间的团结合作，互相支援，更加密切地呼应配合。结成广泛的反帝统一战线、把团结当作同帝国主义和殖民主义斗争的最有力的武器的思想，正日益深入人心。
    越来越多的事实，特别是最近刚果事态的发展，使觉醒了的非洲人民更清楚地看到，帝国主义长期使用并正在使用的保持其殖民统治的最恶毒手段——“分而治之”，它们在非洲人民中不断制造不和，挑拨离间，欺骗分化，利用非洲人打非洲人，使非洲人不能团结起来对付他们真正的敌人，以达到维护殖民统治的目的。以美国为首的西方帝国主义国家，在支持刚果的冲伯等分裂集团的同时，并且恶毒地利用“联合国军”中的非洲国家部队来充当它们干涉刚果内政的工具。刚果总理卢蒙巴在10日同外交使节和新闻记者会见时，已经呼吁有军队受“联合国军”司令部指挥的非洲国家退出“联合国军”，以便不参与联合国对刚果政府和人民所进行的阴谋。几内亚政府和阿拉伯联合共和国政府已经先后决定把它们的部队撤出“联合国军”。在这以前，非洲国家外长会议已经表示支持刚果统一的要求。
    在其他的斗争中，针对着帝国主义的侵略阴谋，非洲人民也在广泛和及时地、有力地互相支援，互相鼓舞。如对英雄的阿尔及利亚人民争取独立的斗争，今年以来，非洲各国公众和舆论就更加广泛和及时地给予支持，谴责法国在阿尔及利亚的血腥暴行，揭露法国的每一个新阴谋，而且更有力地揭露和谴责美帝国主义支持法国的罪恶的殖民战争。许多国家的人民还举行了抗议示威游行。为了更进一步支援阿尔及利亚人民，第二届全非人民大会并建议非洲各国派遣志愿军去支援阿尔及利亚人民的正义战争。今年初，对于法国在撒哈拉沙漠试验原子装置、南非联邦政府残暴屠杀非洲人，非洲许多国家政府都曾发表声明加以谴责，非洲各国公众和舆论更是同时掀起了声势浩大的抗议怒潮。非洲各地人民也纷纷举行抗议集会和群众示威游行。
    为了加强互相支援，非洲各国更经常地举行会议，讨论共同问题，采取共同的行动纲领。全非人民大会已经举行了两次，这两届具有历史意义的大会都促进了非洲国家的团结。它们都通过了加强团结以争取全非洲人民都取得民族独立的决议。第一届全非人民大会的一个主要口号就是“非洲人民团结起来”。会议通过的宣言要求非洲独立国家“以一切可能的办法，对正在为反对帝国主义和殖民主义而斗争的附属国人民提供最大限度的援助，从而使它们迅速获得解放”。今年初召开的第二届全非人民大会也号召全非人民“加强他们队伍的团结，以便在1960年为非洲独立进行决定性的战斗”。决议强调说，“为了更有效地抗击帝国主义者的勾结和迅速地把所有附属国的人民从外国压迫之下解放出来，绝对必须联合和团结全体非洲人的力量。”这次大会还建议非洲各国派志愿军支援阿尔及利亚，号召所有非洲国家支援阿尔及利亚。除全非人民大会之外，近年来，非洲国家之间还举行了非洲独立国家会议、非洲国家及政党紧急会议和最近举行的非洲国家外长会议等。在联合国中，各非洲国家也成立了非洲集团，加强外交行动方面的合作。
    非洲人民在加强自己队伍的团结的同时，也在加强同全世界爱好和平的力量、反帝力量的团结，把他们自己的斗争当作全世界反对帝国主义斗争的一部分。非洲国家一直积极参加亚非人民团结大会的工作，几内亚总统塞古·杜尔在第二届亚非人民团结大会上说，亚非国家人民的团结是我们共同利益的最好保证，是实现我们愿望的最可靠的基础。非洲人民也日益清楚地看到，作为帝国主义的魁首的美帝国主义，今天也是非洲人民的最凶恶的敌人。它支持法国在阿尔及利亚的罪恶统治和殖民战争，企图取代英、法、比等老牌殖民主义国家在非洲的地位。最近它想鲸吞刚果就是个明显的例子。因此非洲人民也把他们自己的争取民族独立的统一战线看作为全世界人民反对以美帝国主义为首的帝国主义的广泛的统一战线的一部分。他们加强了同最坚决地反对帝国主义的社会主义阵营各国之间的友好合作。一些新独立的非洲国家很快就同社会主义国家建立外交关系，发展友好合作关系。非洲人民深信，倚靠加强他们本身的团结，以及加强同世界上一切反对帝国主义的力量的团结，全非洲的民族独立运动，必能克服各种困难，从一个胜利走向一个胜利。（新华社）
