    Vigorously Grasp Daily Plans

    Daily plans are the foundation of a factory or mine's monthly plan. To realize the monthly plan, one must start with the daily plan. Only by using the daily plan as a basis can we formulate active and reliable monthly plans; only by first completing the daily plan can we guarantee the realization of the monthly plan. Therefore, grasping daily plans should be an important task in the daily leadership work of Party organizations at all levels in factories and mines.

    To vigorously grasp daily plans, we must act swiftly and decisively, with "action" as the priority. To achieve success in increasing production and practicing economy, we must rely on practical action and the effective organization of plan implementation. This requires us to check the implementation of the plan every day and solve key production problems in a timely and effective manner. Because, in daily production activities, new problems are constantly emerging; the emergence of a problem often has complex and intricate causes. Only by checking the implementation of the plan every day can we discover problems in a timely manner and find the root cause of the problems. Of course, finding the root cause of the problem is only the beginning of solving the problem. Immediately following this, we must act swiftly and decisively to thoroughly solve the problem. Only in this way can we guarantee the daily completion of the production increase and economy plan. The Jurong Dongchang Coal Mine started by focusing on the hourly plan, achieving hourly guarantees for shifts, shift guarantees for days, and daily guarantees for ten-day periods, finally completing the August coal mining plan five days ahead of schedule. It can be seen that a swift and decisive work style is very important for vigorously grasping daily plans. As for how to vigorously grasp daily plans, many factories and mines have also explored many successful experiences. For example, establishing a system for daily economic activity analysis, discovering weak links in plan completion and their causes through daily analysis, getting to the bottom of things, and solving them item by item; "hanging maps for combat" at all levels, organizing "three-way combination" inspection teams, discovering problems, tracking them down, conducting on-site "consultations," and thoroughly solving them; establishing shock brigades to tackle key problems, and assigning capable comrades to take charge, setting time limits to tackle key problems.

    Whether the daily plan is grasped vigorously also depends on whether we are grasping the "key points." The so-called grasping the "key points" means grasping the production teams. If the work of the teams is done well, and each shift and each group can complete the plan every day, then there will be a solid foundation for completing the plan for the entire enterprise on a daily basis. The current practice of some factories and mines of "landing at the team level and grasping to the end" is very worthy of attention. To do a good job in team work, judging from the experience of some units, it is necessary to help the teams improve their management level, such as helping to establish team accounting systems and pre-shift and post-shift meeting systems, to clarify tasks before the shift and check progress after the shift, so that each team has a clear understanding of the key issues in the implementation of the plan on that day, so as to solve key problems in a timely manner; at the same time, it is also necessary to grasp the advanced, grasp the backward, help the advanced teams summarize their experiences, help the backward catch up with the advanced, organize employees to better carry out the learning, comparison, catching up, and helping competition, fully mobilize the enthusiasm and creativity of each employee, so that each team can complete the production increase and economy targets every day.

    Finally, it should be noted that in grasping daily plans, special attention should be paid to ideological mobilization of the masses of employees. Only when every employee can fully understand the significance of increasing production and practicing economy, and firmly establish the viewpoint of completing the national plan in a balanced way, can every employee be motivated to complete the plan every day. At the same time, vigorously grasping daily plans should comprehensively grasp the indicators, ensuring high output, high quality, low consumption, high efficiency, multiple varieties, and safe production, and comprehensively completing the plan. Only when all the indicators are comprehensively completed does it meet the requirements of increasing production and practicing economy, and is a powerful manifestation of resolutely implementing the general line of building socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results.

### 狠抓日计划

专栏：地方报纸评论摘要

    狠抓日计划
    日计划是厂矿企业月计划的基础，实现月计划，必须以日计划为起点。只有以日计划作依据，才能制定积极可靠的月计划；首先完成日计划，才能保证月计划的实现。因此，抓日计划应该是厂矿企业各级党组织日常领导工作中的一项重要任务。
    狠抓日计划，一定要雷厉风行，“行”字当头。要取得增产节约的成就，一定要靠实际行动，靠切实地组织计划的实现。这就要求我们天天检查计划的执行情况，及时而有效地解决生产关键问题。因为，在日常生产活动中，新问题总是不断发生的；一个问题的出现，又往往有着错综复杂的原因。只有天天检查计划的执行情况，才能及时地发现问题，找出问题的症结所在。当然，找到问题的症结，这还只是解决问题的开始，紧接着就要雷厉风行，彻底解决问题。这样，才能保证按日地完成增产节约计划。句容东昌煤矿从每小时的计划抓起，做到了以时保班，以班保日，以日保旬，终于提前五天完成了8月份的采煤计划。可见，雷厉风行的作风，对于狠抓日计划来说，是十分重要的。至于怎样雷厉风行地抓日计划呢？许多厂矿企业也已摸索到了不少成功的经验。譬如，建立按日进行经济活动分析的制度，通过逐日分析，及时发现完成计划中的薄弱环节及其原因，寻根究底，逐项解决；层层“挂图作战”，组织“三结合”检查小组，发现问题，跟踪追击，现场“会诊”，彻底解决；成立攻关键的突击队，并指定得力的同志挂帅，限时限刻包打关键。
    日计划抓得狠不狠，还要看我们是不是抓在“骨节眼”上。所谓抓“骨节眼”，就是抓生产班组。班组工作做好了，每个班、每个组都能天天完成计划，按日完成整个企业的计划也就有了牢固的基础。目前有些厂矿企业采取的“到班组落脚，一竿抓到底”的做法，很值得重视。要抓好小组工作，从一些单位的经验看来，就是要帮助小组提高管理水平，譬如帮助建立班组核算制度、班前班后会议制度，做到班前明确任务，班后检查进度，使每个小组对当天执行计划中的关键问题了如指掌，以便及时地解决关键问题；同时，还要抓先进，抓落后，帮助先进小组总结经验，帮助落后赶先进，组织职工更好地开展学、比、赶、帮竞赛，充分调动每个职工的积极性和创造性，使班班组组每天都能完成增产节约指标。
    最后，需要注意的是，在抓日计划中，特别要抓好职工群众的思想发动工作。只有使每个职工都能充分地了解增产节约的意义，牢固地树立均衡地完成国家计划的观点，才能使每个职工干劲十足地天天完成计划。同时，狠抓日计划，应当全面抓指标，保证高产、优质、低耗、高效率、多品种、安全生产，全面完成计划。只有全面完成了各项指标，才符合增产节约的要求，才是坚决贯彻多快好省地建设社会主义总路线的有力表现。
