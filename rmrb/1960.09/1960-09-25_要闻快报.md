　　Paving the Way for Steel Production Everywhere
　　In the movement to increase steel production, the Hunan Xikuangshan Mining Bureau resolutely and rapidly concentrated all available resources to vigorously support the development of production in iron and coal enterprises such as the Lengshuijiang Iron and Steel Plant in terms of technology, labor, and materials. The bureau, led by the Party Committee Secretary, formed a support steel work group composed of bureau and section chiefs, as well as mining, geology, and mechanical and electrical engineers, to go to steel plants and coal mines to help solve key production problems. It also transferred cadres, technicians, and more than 600 workers, along with a complete set of equipment, to invest in iron ore production. The bureau guaranteed to supply 60% of the ore required by the Lengshuijiang Iron and Steel Plant from September to December, paving the way for increased steel production everywhere.
　　Coal Mine and Transportation Departments Cooperate to Transport Coal
　　Coal and coke transportation workers in the Guangyuan area of Sichuan launched a chain competition to cooperate in transporting coal. The coal department increased the number of loading and unloading workers, organized three shifts for loading and unloading, and the railway department transferred veteran loading and unloading foremen to strengthen loading and unloading technical management, allocated loading and unloading machinery, added loading lines, and extended high platforms, greatly shortening the unloading time. The highway maintenance department rushed to repair the main roads for coal transportation, increasing the driving speed by five kilometers per hour. The Guangyuan Coal Transportation Command also implemented a flexible task assignment system based on the characteristics of transportation by automobiles and trains, both long-distance and short-distance, matching automobiles and trains, and combining long-distance and short-distance transportation. The transportation volume in August increased by 10.1% compared to July, setting a new record of nearly 6,000 tons per day.
　　Preparing "Grain and Grass" for Small Blast Furnaces Early
　　Leaders at all levels of the metallurgical industry system in Wuxi City, Jiangsu Province, used the "grasping with both hands" working method to promote the increase of pig iron production. On the one hand, they focused on current production, trying every means to produce more pig iron, striving to exceed the second quarter in the third quarter. On the other hand, they seized the preparations for the fourth quarter's production, focusing on the comprehensive technical transformation and strengthening of equipment maintenance of the existing small blast furnaces, and correspondingly grasping raw materials, materials, and transportation inside and outside the factory, actively creating conditions for a substantial increase in pig iron production.
　　Implementing Post Responsibility System Extends Converter Lifespan
　　In order to extend the lifespan of converters and ensure the continuous leap forward in steel production, the Steelmaking Plant of the Shanghai Metallurgical Research Institute implemented a post responsibility system for brickmaking, furnace lining, and furnace front, centering on the converter. Each process formulated specific measures around the overall goal of extending furnace life and strictly implemented them. Since September, it has continuously set new records for converter furnace life, reaching a maximum of 215 heats, becoming the unit with the highest converter furnace life in Shanghai.
　　Overcoming the Rainy Season to Transport More Grain and Steel Materials
　　Workers on the transportation front in the Yunnan Plateau conquered mountains and rapid rivers, overcame the difficulties of driving in the rainy season, and did everything possible to improve transportation efficiency, resulting in a substantial increase in the transportation volume of the main materials needed for increased grain and steel production. The province's automobile freight volume in August increased by 12% compared to July, with coal, coke, ore, and materials to ensure increased grain production increasing by 10% to 50% respectively. In early September, under the conditions of heavy rain every day in many areas, the average daily transportation volume completed by various automobile transportation stations and teams was generally higher than the same period last month.
