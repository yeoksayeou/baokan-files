Xinhua News Agency, Havana, August 31st: A recent issue of the weekly "Nueva Cuba" published a commentary discussing the failure of the U.S. policy of hostility toward China. The weekly pointed out that the U.S. has established military organizations and built military bases in other countries to oppose China. The commentary cited the downfall of Nobusuke Kishi and Syngman Rhee, loyal pawns of the U.S., as evidence, stating that "in recent months, the failure of U.S. foreign policy has been very evident."

The weekly said that attempting to not recognize a country with a population of 650 million is completely illogical.

The weekly said that in the early years of the Chinese revolution, so-called experts on the China question expressed doubt about the country's ability to overcome its long-term backwardness. The weekly said they believed that "China will always be a China of hunger, epidemics, and floods." However, "now, even those who are known for their hostility to the country's system must admit" that "tremendous changes" have taken place on Chinese soil. The commentary emphasized that "due to the revolutionary zeal of the people, China is changing every day, and it has become one of the major world powers."

The commentary said, "All U.S. efforts to prevent the Chinese people from entering the international arena through the artificial obstacles it stubbornly creates are futile. The Chinese people exist, and China is growing stronger day by day. U.S. foreign policy toward China is in crisis, and the day when it suffers a major setback is not far off."

The weekly published a photograph of Chairman Mao Zedong next to the commentary.

    “新古巴”周刊发表评论指出
    中国已成世界主要强国
    美国对华政策陷入危机
    新华社哈瓦那8月31日电　最近出版的一期“新古巴”周刊发表评论，论述美国敌视中国的政策的失败。这家周刊指出，美国建立军事组织，并且在其它国家建立军事基地来反对中国。评论列举岸信介和李承晚等美国忠实走狗的垮台等事实证明说，“在最近几个月内，美国外交政策的失败是非常明显的。”
    这家周刊说，企图不承认一个拥有六亿五千万人口的国家是完全不合乎逻辑的。
    这家周刊说，在中国革命的头几年里，号称中国问题的专家们对这个国家摆脱它的长期落后状况的能力表示怀疑。周刊说，他们认为，“中国将永远是饥饿、时疫和水灾的中国。”但是，“现在，甚至那些以敌视这个国家的制度著名的人们也不得不承认”，在中国的土地上“已经发生了巨大的变化”。评论强调指出，“由于人民的革命干劲，中国每天都在发生变化，它已经成了世界的主要强国之一。”
    评论说，“美国企图通过它顽固地制造的人为障碍来阻止中国人民进入国际舞台的一切努力都是徒劳的。中国人民存在着，中国正在日益强大。美国对中国的外交政策正处于危机之中，它遭到重大挫折的日子已经不远了。”
    这家周刊在这篇评论旁边刊登了毛泽东主席的照片。
