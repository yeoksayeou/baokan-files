The unprecedented celebration was held in Ba Dinh Square. It was here, fifteen years ago, that the great leader of the Vietnamese people, President Ho Chi Minh, solemnly proclaimed the birth of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. Before dawn today, people from all walks of life in Hanoi flocked to this famous square and the main streets of the city to celebrate this national holiday.

At 6:00 a.m., when President Ho Chi Minh, along with Le Duan, Truong Chinh, Pham Van Dong, Ton Duc Thang, Vo Nguyen Giap, and other leaders of the Vietnamese Labor Party and the government, ascended the rostrum, the entire venue erupted in cheers and slogans that lasted for a long time.

Joining the Vietnamese national leaders on the rostrum were the heads of the party and government delegations from various socialist countries, and the heads and representatives of fraternal party delegations.

The ceremony began with the playing of the Vietnamese national anthem and a salute of cannons.

General Vo Nguyen Giap, Minister of National Defense and Commander-in-Chief of the Vietnamese People's Army, reviewed the army, navy, and air force of the Vietnamese People's Army. He then issued orders to the entire Vietnamese People's Army.

After General Vo Nguyen Giap issued the order, the parade began. The soldiers of various arms, holding modern weapons, passed the rostrum with majestic and orderly steps, demonstrating the heroic and tenacious fighting will and invincible power of the Vietnamese People's Army. The militia composed of workers, peasants, and cadres also received the review, each of them full of vigor and high spirits.

Then, a mighty mass parade passed through the square. They held aloft various charts, models, and physical objects, showing the brilliant achievements of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam in industry, agriculture, culture, education, and other fields over the past fifteen years. People held various bouquets, colorful flags, and balloons, cheering as they passed the rostrum, and a joyful atmosphere filled the entire square.

After the parade, the masses gathered in the square surged forward to the rostrum to pay tribute to the national leaders and distinguished guests from various countries. At this moment, President Ho Chi Minh personally led everyone in singing the song "Unity is Strength," and the singing resounded through the clouds.

Today, the citizens of Hanoi enjoyed themselves in street and square carnivals. Artists from various performing arts groups performed in different districts for the reveling masses, joining them in the festivities.
