    More on Trees and Forests Shi Yan
    In my previous article, I said something like this: "If you delve into a 'point' and understand the situation, gaining experience, but treat this experience like a good arrow, twirling it in your hand, exclaiming, 'Good arrow! Good arrow!' and are unwilling to release it, unwilling to apply and promote it on a broader 'plane,' then the good experience and good methods will only remain at the 'point.'" (Published in the September 6th "People's Daily")
    Upon careful reflection, I feel I haven't fully expressed my thoughts, and there's a need to say a few more words.
    If good experiences and good methods are not promoted and applied on a broader "plane," they will indeed only remain at the "point." Moreover, the "good" in "good experience" is limited; it cannot be considered the best. Why is this?
    The general exists within the particular, and guiding the general through typical examples is one aspect. On the other hand, the breadth and depth of generalization that can be reflected, expressed, and summarized from any individual, concrete thing—even a typical experience—always has its limitations. The experience of a "point" needs to be supplemented by drawing experience from the "plane," from many other points on the "plane." Any advanced unit has its shortcomings and deficiencies, while any backward unit often has its merits. Gathering those scattered, unsystematic "merits" from the "plane," from many other points on the "plane," sorting them out, improving them, and then permeating and integrating them into the typical experience of advanced units—then this experience becomes an alloy, more capable of withstanding the tests of facts and time. This experience will then be more substantial, more complete, more comprehensive, and have more universal significance.
    In fact, any relatively profound, complete, and systematic summary of experience is not limited to the experience of a specific, individual thing (although it can take the experience of a specific, individual thing as its foundation). It often simultaneously draws upon experience from other areas. The new coal mining method centered on hydraulic transport, mentioned in the previous article, originated from the Third Coal Mining Section of the Fifth Pit of the Ping'an Mine in Fuxin City. However, "originated" is only "originated"; this new coal mining method also includes the experience of the Sixth Section of the Second Pit, as well as the experience of other pits and sections. Song Yaxin, the First Secretary of the Danyang County Party Committee, gained experience in rationally allocating labor from the comparison between the good and bad performance of the Pengtang and Dagong Brigades. This experience is not only from the Pengtang Brigade but also includes many other specialized production teams and commune-run enterprises. Furthermore, the Dagong Brigade provided negative material, giving Secretary Song inspiration.
    Going deep into the grassroots, delving into a "point," and gaining direct experience is the only way to more profoundly understand the laws of objective things and more skillfully master the laws of objective things. This is one aspect; on the other hand, a person's energy and time are ultimately limited. He cannot personally handle everything, one by one. Of the myriad things in the world, what a person sees is far less than what he has not seen; what a person experiences firsthand is far less than what he has not experienced; what a person knows is far less than what he does not know. Therefore, one cannot be satisfied with direct experience; one must also supplement it with indirect experience. Chairman Mao mentioned in the "Preface and Postscript to 'Rural Survey'": "The Xunwu Survey involved some middle-level cadres, some lower-level cadres, a poor scholar, a bankrupt guild president, and a petty official in charge of grain and provisions in the county magistrate's office who had lost his job. They all gave me a lot of knowledge I had never heard of. It was a petty jailer in Hengshan County, Hunan, during a survey that made me understand for the first time the complete corruption of Chinese prisons." The entire corruption of Chinese prisons was something the petty jailer was directly involved in, directly contacted and experienced; Chairman Mao knew it indirectly through the petty jailer. Even a great figure like Chairman Mao still had to use indirect experience to make up for his "never heard of."
    One must both delve into a "point," personally obtain direct experience, and also convene meetings, listen to reports, read documents, and examine materials to obtain indirect experience; one must both personally dissect sparrows to obtain direct experience, and also obtain indirect experience from others' dissection of sparrows; one must both "squat" at a "point" to obtain direct experience, and also "rotate" across a "plane" to obtain indirect experience. Neither can be neglected. Didn't Danyang County Party Secretary Song Yaxin personally dissect sparrows, and at the same time hold commune Party committee meetings and county committee meetings?
    The development of things is always uneven. Some units (production teams, workshops, canteens, etc.) that were advanced in the past are still advanced now; some units that were advanced in the past are now backward; some units that were backward in the past are still backward; some units that were backward in the past have now caught up; some units, although advanced, have not changed much for a long time; some units have absorbed the advanced experience of others and, combined with their specific circumstances, have made creative developments, even surpassing their predecessors. If one clings to a "point," satisfied with the experience already gained, one will not see the interwoven, ever-changing landscape of the entire "plane," and one will block one's sensitivity to new things. Where does sensitivity come from? To a large extent, it comes from constantly analyzing and comparing objective things. Clinging to a "point" also means losing the possibility and opportunity to make comparisons.
    Therefore, obtaining typical experience from a certain "point" and promoting and applying it on a broader "plane" is one aspect; on the other hand, one must also draw experience from the "plane," from many other points on the "plane," to further enrich and develop the original typical experience. Sometimes, newer and better typical experience may not emerge from the original "base point" but from another place on the "plane," and we can then promptly discover and grasp it.
    People have two legs to walk, and birds have two wings to fly. By mastering both the "point" and the "plane," both grasping the typical and not letting go of the general, with this Marxist-Leninist working method, we can open paths through mountains and build bridges across rivers along the socialist and communist path of advancement, and we will be invincible. What can the various obstacles and obstructions lying across the path of advancement do to us?

    再论树木与森林	石燕
    在上一篇文章中，我曾经讲过这样一段话：“如果深入到一点去，虽然了解了情况，取得了经验，但是，把这经验当作一枝好箭，在手里搓来搓去，口称‘好箭呀！好箭呀！’就是不愿放出去，不愿在‘面’上运用和推广，那么，好经验、好办法也就只能停在‘点’上。”  （载9月6日《人民日报》）
    仔细想想，意犹未尽，有再说几句的必要。
    好经验、好办法如果不在“面”上推广和运用，固然只能停留在“点”上，而且，这个好字，也是有限度的，还不能算是最好。为什么呢？
    共性寓于个性之中，通过典型去指导一般，这是一方面；还有另一方面，从任何个别的、具体的事物中所总结出的经验，即使是典型经验也吧，其所能反映、能表达、能概括一般性（同性）的广度和深度，又总有它的局限性。“点”的经验，需要从“面”，从“面”的其他许多点上吸取经验来补充。任何先进单位总有它的缺点和不足，而任何落后单位也常常有其可取之处。从“面”上、从“面”的其他许多点上，把那些点滴的、分散的、不成系统的“可取之处”集合起来，加以整理、提高，然后又把它渗透、溶合到先进单位的典型经验中去，那么，这经验就是一块合金，就更加经得起事实的和时间的考验，这经验也才能更充实、更完善、更全面、更有普遍意义。
    其实，任何较为深刻的、完善的、系统的经验总结，都不是局限于某个个别的、具体的事物中的经验（虽然它可以把某个个别的、具体的事物中的经验作为基础）。它往往是同时吸取了其他方面的经验。上篇文章中所提到的以水力运输为中心的新采煤法，导源于阜新市平安矿五坑第三采煤段，导源也仅是导源，这项新采煤法也同时包括了二坑六段的经验，以及其他坑、段的经验；丹阳县委第一书记宋亚欣从彭塘、大贡两个大队的好坏对比中，取得了合理安排劳动力的经验。这个经验也不仅是彭塘大队的，也包括了其他许多专业生产队和社办公社的。还有一点，大贡大队又从反面提供了材料，给宋书记以启发。
    深入基层、深入一点，取得直接经验，只有这样，才能更深刻地认识客观事物的规律，也才能更熟练地掌握客观事物的规律。这是一方面；还有另一方面，一个人的精力和时间究竟有限，他不能一桩桩、一件件，事事躬亲。五湖四海，万事万物，一个人所见到的要比他没有见到的少得多；一个人所亲身经历的事要比他没有经历的少得多；一个人所知道的要比他不知道的少得多。因此，不能满足于直接经验，还要用间接经验来补充。毛主席在《〈农村调查〉的序言和跋》中提到：“寻邬调查找的是一部分中级干部，一部分下级干部，一个穷秀才，一个破产了的商会会长，一个在知县衙门管钱粮的已经失了业的小官吏。他们都给了我很多闻所未闻的知识。使我第一次懂得中国监狱全部腐败情形的，是在湖南衡山县作调查时该县的一个小狱吏。”中国监狱全部腐败情形，在小狱吏是身临其境，直接接触过、体验过的；在毛主席是通过小狱吏间接知道的。就像伟大的毛主席，也还是要通过间接经验来弥补自己的“闻所未闻”的。
    既要深入一点，亲自动手取得直接经验，也要召开会议，听汇报，看文件，看材料取得间接经验；既要亲手解剖麻雀取得直接经验，也要从别人的解剖麻雀中取得间接经验；既要“蹲点”取得直接经验，也要“转面”取得间接经验。两者不可偏废。丹阳县委书记宋亚欣不是亲手解剖了麻雀，也同时开了公社党委会、县委会吗？
    事物发展又总是不平衡的。有的单位（生产队、车间、食堂等等）过去先进的，现在还是先进；有的单位过去先进，现在落后了；有的单位过去落后，现在还是落后的；有的单位过去落后，现在又赶到前面去了；有的单位虽然是先进的，但是长时期来没有什么变化；有的单位吸取了别人的先进经验，又结合着自己的具体情况，有了创造性的发展，以致青出于蓝而胜于蓝。如果孤守一点，满足于已经取得的经验，那就会看不到整个面上的纵横交错，千变万化，那就会蔽塞自己对新事物的敏感。敏感何来？它在很大程度上是对客观事物不断地分析和比较中得来的。孤守一点，也就是失去了可以进行比较的可能和机会。
    因此，从某一“点”中取得典型经验，在“面”上推广和运用，这是一方面；另一方面，又要从“面”上、从面的其他许多点上取得经验，使原有的典型经验，进一步地充实和发展。有时候，更新更美的典型经验，也许不是在原有的“基点”，而在“面”上的另一个地方冒出地平线来，我们又能及时地发现和掌握住。
    人有两条腿能走，鸟有两只翅会飞。既掌握“点”，又掌握“面”；既抓住典型，又不放松一般，有了这个马克思列宁主义的工作方法，我们就能沿着社会主义、共产主义的前进方向，逢山开道，遇水架桥，无往而不利。横在前进道路上的种种阻梗和障碍，其奈我何？
