　　Xinhua News Agency Comprehensive Report: According to Xinhua News Agency, Iraq, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Iran, and the Kingdom of Venezuela held a meeting of oil-producing countries in Baghdad from the 10th to the 14th. The convening of this meeting was due to the recent unilateral decision by the American and British international oil monopoly groups extracting oil in Middle Eastern countries to lower crude oil prices.

　　According to the Iraqi News Agency, a resolution of the meeting stated that oil-producing countries cannot sit idly by regarding the attitude of oil companies toward changing crude oil prices. The resolution called on oil-producing countries to demand that oil companies maintain fixed prices. The resolution said that the countries attending the meeting should take all possible measures to restore crude oil prices to the level before the recent announcement of the price reduction. The meeting decided to establish an "Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries" through which to conduct regular consultations to coordinate and unify the policies of oil-producing countries.

　　The countries participating in this meeting are considered the founding countries of the new organization. Any country exporting large quantities of crude oil has the right to join the organization if the founding countries unanimously agree. The meeting also decided to hold a second meeting of oil-producing countries in Venezuela in January next year.

　　Recently, the American and British international oil monopoly groups extracting oil in Middle Eastern countries made a decision to reduce crude oil prices by 7% without consulting with the oil-producing countries. According to the agreement between the oil companies and the oil-producing countries, the oil-producing countries only receive a certain percentage of the profits from the sale of crude oil as concession tax (usually 50%), while the oil companies do not share with the oil-producing countries the profits earned from refining and sales, which are also under their monopoly. At the same time, the sales prices of petroleum products do not decrease with the price of crude oil. Therefore, after the price of crude oil is reduced, the oil companies can not only fully recover this loss from refining and sales, but also seize the losses suffered by the oil-producing countries for themselves. According to the British "Financial Times," American and British international oil companies plan to cut the listed price of Middle Eastern crude oil in half within ten years. The first price reduction implemented in February last year (a reduction of eighteen cents per barrel of oil) had already caused considerable losses to Middle Eastern oil-producing countries—Saudi Arabia lost 35 million US dollars, and Iraq lost 27 million US dollars.

　　Now this second decision to reduce prices (a reduction of fourteen cents per barrel) has aroused widespread opposition and condemnation from oil-producing countries in the Middle East. It has also aroused dissatisfaction among some oil-producing countries in Latin America.

### 反对美英石油公司压低原油价格  五个石油出产国举行会议  决定建立国际组织维护产油国利益

    反对美英石油公司压低原油价格
    五个石油出产国举行会议
    决定建立国际组织维护产油国利益
    本报综合报道　据新华社讯：伊拉克、沙特阿拉伯、科威特、伊朗和委内瑞拉王国，从10日到14日在巴格达举行了石油出产国家会议。这次会议的召开，是由于在中东各国开采石油的美英国际石油垄断集团最近单方面作出了降低原油价格的决定。
    据伊拉克通讯社报道，会议的一项决议说，各产油国对石油公司改变原油价格的态度不能袖手旁观。决议号召各产油国要求石油公司维持固定的价格。决议说，出席会议的国家应当采取一切可能的办法使原油价格恢复到最近宣布降低以前的水平。会议决定建立一个“石油输出国组织”，通过它经常进行磋商来协调和统一各产油国的政策。
    参加这次会议的国家被认为是这个新组织的发起国。如果发起国一致同意，任何出口大量原油的国家都有权利参加这个组织。会议还决定，明年1月在委内瑞拉举行第二次石油出产国会议。
    最近，在中东各国开采石油的美英国际石油垄断集团没有和产油国磋商就擅自作出了降低原油价格7％的决定。根据各石油公司和各产油国家的协定，各产油国家仅仅从出卖原油的利润中分得一定百分比作为租让税（通常是50％），而各石油公司从同样在它们垄断下的炼油和销售方面赚得的利润，不分给产油国。同时，石油产品的销售价格并不随着原油的价格而降低。因此，原油降价后，石油公司不仅可以从炼油和销售中完全收回这项损失，而且把产油国因此而受的损失也攫为己有。据英国“金融时报”报道，美英国际石油公司计划要在十年内把中东原油标价削减一半。在去年2月间实行的第一次减价（每桶石油减价一角八分美元），就已使中东产油国家遭到了不小的损失——沙特阿拉伯损失三千五百万美元，伊拉克损失二千七百万美元。
    现在这第二次减价（每桶减一角四分美元）的决定，引起了中东各产油国的普遍反对和谴责。也引起了拉丁美洲一些产油国的不满。
