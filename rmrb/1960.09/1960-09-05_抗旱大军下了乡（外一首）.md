    The Anti-Drought Army Goes to the Countryside (and Another Poem)
    By Yuzhou, Wuhan Iron and Steel Company
    Putting down the hammer, bidding farewell to the lathe,
    Gently whispered: Goodbye!
    Red surveying pole upon my shoulder I carry.
    Wearing a proper willow hat, neatly dressed in worker's garb;
    Bending down to pick up the triangular flag,
    Medals clinking against medals on my chest!
    The man goes, and the heart goes too, the heart is filled with WISCO:
    Thinking of WISCO five years ago,
    A desolate graveyard glimmering with will-o'-the-wisps...
    It was this surveying pole,
    That chased away tigers and wolves from the weeds;
    It was this triangular flag,
    That reddened the ten miles of mountain ridges...
    Mastering all eighteen martial arts,
    Putting down the surveying pole to operate the lathe;
    Supporting the commune in repairing canals,
    "We're back at our old trade again!"
    Sitting in the transport vehicle, looking back as I leave,
    My heart beating fast, words flying with the wind into the factory:
    "The surveying pole has measured thousands of mountains,
    The cutting tool has cut apart ten thousand tons of steel;
    Now going to the countryside to fight the drought demon,
    Goodbye, goodbye, my beloved factory..."

    Oh, car, run fast, the red flag on the engine waving,
    The horn honking,
    My heart jumping like a motor,
    Oh, my car, run fast!
    The car is full of water pumps,
    The commune is waiting,
    To conquer the drought demon and capture the Dragon King,
    We must be the vanguard.
    Seizing yellow grain from the heavens,
    Not a single grain shall be lost!
    Striving to strengthen and transform barren mountains,
    Commanding barren mountains to grow rice!
    The car flies on the road,
    Eyes looking into the distance,
    "Oh, car, car, run fast,
    My thoughts you know..."

    抗旱大军下了乡（外一首）
    武汉钢铁公司　宇宙放下鎯头，告别车床，轻轻说了声：再见！红色标杆肩上扛。带正柳条帽，整整工人装；俯身拿起三角旗，胸前奖章碰奖章！人走心也走，心里装满武钢：想起武钢五年前，一片荒坟闪磷光……就是这根标杆，草丛赶跑虎和狼；正是这面三角旗，映红了十里山岗……精通武艺十八般，放下标杆开车床；支援公社修渠道，“咱又干上了老一行！”坐上交通车，出门回头望，心儿跳得急，话声随风飞进厂：“标杆量过千架山，车刀车碎万吨钢；又赴农村战旱魔，再见，再见，我的亲爱的
  厂……”
    车呵你快跑车头红旗飘，喇叭嘟嘟叫，心像马达跳蹦蹦，我的车呵你快跑！车上尽水泵，公社等着要，战胜旱魔擒龙王，要靠咱们打头炮。向天夺黄粮，一颗不准少！发愤图强改荒山，命令荒山长水稻！车在路上飞，眼往远处瞧，“车呵车呵快快跑，我的心思你知道……”
