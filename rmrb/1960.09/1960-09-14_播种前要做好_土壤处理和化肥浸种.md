    Soil Treatment and Fertilizer Seed Soaking Should Be Done Well Before Sowing

    "A rich harvest is conceived during the wheat harvest, and good sowing determines 70% of the yield." Sowing wheat well and adequately is the key to striving for a bumper wheat harvest. This year, the average yield per mu of our 200 mu of wheat in the Wu'ai Commune Agricultural Research Institute of Kaifeng City increased by 20% compared to 1959, which is inseparable from our attention to doing a good job in wheat sowing.

    To do a good job in wheat sowing, in addition to land preparation and moisture conservation, increasing base fertilizer application, selecting fine varieties, timely sowing, and rational close planting, we also used "666" powder to treat the soil to prevent underground insects; and soaked seeds in phosphate fertilizer to ensure full and strong wheat seedlings.

    Most of the cultivated land in our commune is sandy soil, and wheat seedlings often suffer from the harm of various underground insects such as mole crickets, grubs, and cutworms every year, resulting in missing seedlings and broken ridges. Last year, when sowing wheat, in order to eliminate underground insects and ensure full wheat seedlings, our research institute's 200 mu of wheat fields were scattered with 5 to 10 jin of 0.5% "666" powder per mu while plowing. The "666" powder applied to the soil has a great effect on killing pests: mole crickets and grubs will be poisoned and die when they eat the soil, and cutworms have weaker resistance to poison and die faster when they come into contact with the poison. This effectively ensures full wheat seedlings. According to a survey of 50 mu of wheat fields, the seedling deficiency rate in the soil treated with "666" powder per mu was only 0.05%, and the yield per mu was 364 jin; the seedling deficiency rate in wheat fields without soil treatment reached 0.46%, and the yield per mu was 266 jin. It can be seen that soil treatment to eliminate underground insects is an effective technical measure to ensure full wheat seedlings and increase yield.

    Using superphosphate to soak seeds makes wheat seedlings emerge early, evenly, and strongly. Last year, before sowing wheat, our wheat seeds were soaked in superphosphate solution for 10 to 24 hours, and after sowing, seedlings emerged two days earlier than those not soaked in phosphate fertilizer, and the wheat seedlings were particularly uniform and robust. According to the seedling stage survey: seeds soaked in 3% superphosphate solution had an average of 4.4 primary roots and 18 secondary roots per wheat plant; seeds soaked in 2% superphosphate solution had an average of 3.2 primary roots and 13.1 secondary roots per wheat plant. Because the wheat root system is well developed and effective tillering is increased, the yield increase effect is also very significant. The 100 mu of wheat in our institute that was soaked in phosphate fertilizer had an average yield increase of 34.5 jin per mu compared to those not soaked.

    播种前要做好
    土壤处理和化肥浸种	开封市五爱公社农科所副所长	河南省农业科学院特约研究员  张胜杰
    “麦收胎里富，种好七成收”，把麦种好种足，是争取小麦大丰收的关键。今年我们开封市五爱公社农科所的二百亩小麦，平均亩产比1959年提高20％，就是和我们注意作好小麦播种工作分不开的。
    作好小麦播种工作，除了整地保墒、增施底肥、选用良种、适时播种、合理密植外，我们还用“六六六”粉处理土壤，防止地下虫；用磷肥浸种，保证小麦苗全、苗壮。
    我们公社的耕地多是青沙土壤，每年小麦苗期常常遭受蝼蛄、蛴螬、地老虎等各种地下虫的危害，形成缺苗断垅。去年麦播时，为了消灭地下虫，保证小麦全苗，我所的二百亩麦田，每亩随犁地随撒入0.5％的“六六六”粉五至十斤。施入土壤中的“六六六”粉药杀害虫的作用很大：蝼蛄、蛴螬吃食土壤就会中毒而死，地老虎抗毒能力更弱接触毒药死的更快。这就有效地保证了小麦全苗。根据五十亩麦田的调查，每亩用“六六六”粉处理土壤的，缺苗率只有0.05％，亩产三百六十四斤；没有处理土壤的麦田，缺苗率达到0.46％，亩产二百六十六斤。可见，进行土壤处理，消灭地下虫，是保证小麦全苗和提高产量的有效技术措施。
    使用过磷酸钙浸种，麦苗出的早、齐、壮。去年麦播前，我们的麦种用过磷酸钙溶液浸泡十至二十四个小时，下种后比不用磷肥浸种的提早两天出苗，麦苗也特别整齐、茁壮。根据苗期的调查：用3％的过磷酸钙溶液浸过的种子，平均每棵小麦有四点四个初生根和十八个次生根；用2％的过磷酸钙溶液浸过的种子平均每棵有三点二个初生根和十三点一个次生根。由于小麦根系发育好，有效分蘖增多，增产效果也非常显著。我所用磷肥浸种的一百亩小麦，比没有浸种的，平均亩产增产三十四斤半。
