Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, September 24th: The broad masses of workers and farmers in North Vietnam are launching a new production competition movement, determined to implement the resolutions of the Third National Congress of the Vietnam Labor Party with practical actions and strive to overfulfill the national production plan.

    In recent days, good news has been coming continuously from factories and mines in North Vietnam. The largest textile factory in Vietnam, Nam Dinh Textile Factory, overfulfilled its production plan for the first half of September. In fifteen days, this factory produced more than 131,000 meters of cloth and 9,500 kilograms of fine yarn than originally planned. Technicians and workers at the Hanoi Pharmaceutical Factory have overcome many difficulties since the beginning of September, producing more than 10,000 bottles of saline injection and a large number of surgical sutures, reaching international standards.

    In Hai Phong, a famous industrial city in Vietnam, workers' production technology is constantly improving in the competition movement. Workers in the first loading and unloading team of Hai Phong Port achieved an average loading and unloading volume of 31.8 tons per group per hour, breaking the original advanced target of 28 tons per group per hour. The handling volume of this port currently averages three tons per group per hour more than in August and six tons more than in July.

    On the agricultural front, farmers in various regions are vigorously promoting late rice production and actively preparing for increased production this winter and next spring. Farmers in Vinh Phuc Province have put forward the resounding slogan of "Not giving up an inch of land and striving for a bumper harvest of late rice." From mid-July to now, farmers throughout the province have reclaimed nearly 1,000 mu of wasteland. Recently, farmers in many counties have been promoting advanced planting methods, turning three-season fields into four-season fields, and striving for greater harvests. Farmers in Hung Yen Province, under the slogan of "Striving for more grain and more food," have launched a new production competition. To ensure sufficient water, farmers throughout the province are conducting a comprehensive overhaul of all water conservancy projects and vigorously building dikes to store water, ensuring that the fields are not short of water.

    Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, September 21st: According to the Korean Central News Agency, the Standing Committee of the Central Committee of the General Federation of Trade Unions of Korea decided yesterday to award the glorious title of "Chollima Work Team" to a group of outstanding work teams.

    The Standing Committee decided to award the title of "Double Chollima Work Team" to the Kim Sun-bok women's fishing team of the Haeju Fishery Company to commend its excellent labor achievements.

    新华社河内24日电　越南北方各地广大工人、农民正在开展一个新的生产竞赛运动，决心以实际行动来实现越南劳动党第三次全国代表大会的决议，争取超额完成国家生产计划。
    近日来，越南北方各厂矿企业生产捷报不断传来。越南最大的纺织厂——南定纺织厂超额完成了9月上半月的生产计划。在十五天中这个厂比原订计划多生产了十三万一千多米布和九千五百多公斤细纱。河内制药厂的技术人员和工人，从9月初以来，克服了许多困难，制成了一万多只盐水注射液和大量的手术缝合线，并且达到了国际水平。
    在越南著名的工业城市——海防市，工人的生产技术在竞赛运动中不断提高。海防港口的第一装卸大队工人每组每小时的装卸量平均达到三十一吨八百公斤，突破了原定的每组每小时装卸二十八吨的先进指标。这个港口的搬运量，目前每组每小时平均比8月份增加三吨，比7月份增加六吨。
    在农业战线上，各地农民正在大力推进晚稻生产，并积极为今冬明春增产作好准备。永福省农民提出“寸土不让，力争晚稻丰收”的响亮口号。从7月中旬到现在，全省农民已开垦荒地近一千亩。最近许多县的农民正在推广先进种植方法，把三季田改为四季田，争取更大的丰收。兴安省农民在“力争多谷多粮”的口号下，发动了新的生产竞赛。为了保证有足够的水，全省农民正对所有水利工程进行全面检修，并且大力筑埂蓄水，保证田里不缺水。
    新华社平壤21日电　据朝鲜中央通讯社报道，朝鲜职业总同盟中央委员会常务委员会昨天决定把“千里马作业班”的光荣称号授予一批突出的作业班。
    常务委员会决定把“双重千里马作业班”的称号授予海州渔业公司的金淳福妇女捕鱼队，以表彰它优异的劳动成绩。
