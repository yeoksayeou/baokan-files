Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 8th - The Third National Congress of the Vietnam Workers' Party entered its fourth day today. Many delegates, speaking at the meeting, unanimously endorsed the Political Report of the Central Committee of the Vietnam Workers' Party and the report on amending the Party Constitution. Many delegates also spoke on the work of relevant departments.

During the morning session, the Executive Chairman of the Congress, Hoang Van Hoan, announced the passing of Comrade Wilhelm Pieck, President of the German Democratic Republic and member of the Politburo of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany. The entire hall stood in silence to pay respects. The Congress also unanimously approved a telegram of condolence to the Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany.

During the morning session, the Secretariat of the Congress announced the congratulatory messages sent to the Congress by the Communist Party of Switzerland, the Communist Party of Finland, the Communist Party of Tunisia, and the Communist Party of New Zealand.

According to the Vietnam News Agency, in his speech at the morning session, Ngo Minh Loan, Deputy Minister of Light Industry, spoke about the development of light industry in North Vietnam. He said that during the first Five-Year Plan, in addition to expanding existing factories, North Vietnam would build approximately eighty new factories. These factories would include five sugar refineries, ten or more tea factories (with an annual output of 500 tons of tea), four or five tropical fruit processing factories (with an annual output of 1,000 to 6,000 tons), a series of agricultural product, coffee, milk, and palmarosa oil processing factories, and several wineries. During this period, it is also possible to build two or three sack factories, four or five paper mills, and cardboard factories with an output of 10,000 to 15,000 tons. While establishing more sugar refineries, rayon factories will be built to make full use of bagasse.

Ngo Minh Loan said that if these plans were completed, the average annual textile consumption per person would increase from 5.2 meters to 6.5 meters, sugar from 1.6 kilograms to 3.44 kilograms, and paper from 1.4 kilograms to 2.5 kilograms.

Nguyen Van Tran, member of the Central Committee of the Workers' Party, spoke on transportation work; Dang Viet Chau, Deputy Director of the State Planning Commission, spoke on trade work; and Ta Quang Buu, Deputy Director of the State Science Commission, spoke on scientific research work.

Ta Quang Buu said that he heartily welcomed the Political Report of the Central Committee, because this report "stipulates specific tasks and basic directions for scientific work, and guides the masses to develop our country's science and technology."

He said, "I firmly believe that, under the leadership of the Party, with the broad participation of the masses in scientific work, and with the fraternal and enormous assistance of socialist brother countries, Vietnamese scientists will victoriously complete the glorious tasks assigned to them by the people and the Party."

Ha Huy Giap, Deputy Minister of Education, emphasized in his speech that socialist education must be based on the principle that "education must serve the Party's policies and guidelines, and education must be combined with productive labor." Socialist education must follow this direction: learning must be combined with practice, theory must be closely linked with reality, and education must follow the mass line.

Ha Huy Giap said that education is to impart advanced knowledge, to serve the cause of social liberation and human liberation, and to cultivate a new generation and a new type of person for the construction of socialism and communism.

Hoang Van Thai, Director of the Central Sports Commission, emphasized that improving the people's health is an extremely important issue for increasing labor productivity and increasing production work. When Hoang Van Thai said that President Ho Chi Minh is a model enthusiast in sports, enthusiastic applause broke out in the meeting. He said, "Uncle Ho usually does gymnastics on time, even in the past in the prisons of imperialism or during the busiest period of the resistance war. This explains why President Ho Chi Minh is still very healthy despite his advanced age."

Nguyen Duc Thang, Deputy Minister of Health, spoke about the development of health work. He emphasized that to improve the health of the people, promote production and improve the living conditions of the people, health work is necessary.

Nguyen Lam, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Vietnam Labor Youth League, said that in the next five years, huge tasks await us, so the Youth League needs to continuously improve its fighting spirit. The Labor Youth League, which now has 730,000 members, must further consolidate its organization and expand its ranks to meet the needs of the current revolutionary tasks.

After Nguyen Lam spoke, according to President Ho Chi Minh's suggestion, all the delegates expressed warm congratulations to the youth for enthusiastically and actively completing their tasks and becoming a capable assistant to the Party in building socialism in the North and striving for national reunification.

Also speaking at the morning session were Nguyen Van Tao, Minister of Labor, and representatives from Nghe An province, and others.

Speaking at the afternoon session were: Tran Huu Duc, Minister of Rural Work of the Central Committee of the Workers' Party; Bui Quang Tao, Minister of Construction; Hoang Anh, Minister of Finance; Nguyen Van Loc, Deputy Minister of Agriculture; and representatives from Phu Tho province and Ninh Binh province, and others.

At the afternoon session, the Secretariat of the Congress announced letters written to the Congress by people, workers, youth, ethnic minorities, and children from various regions. In these letters, the writers reported to the Congress on the achievements they had made in labor competitions, expressed their gratitude to the Party, and at the same time assured the Party that they would work even harder in the future under the guidance of the Congress to strive for the realization of the first Five-Year Plan.

At the afternoon session, the Secretariat of the Congress also announced a letter written to the Congress by a Vietnamese Southern patriot imprisoned by the Ngo Dinh Diem clique. This patriot recently sent President Ho Chi Minh a pen to express his respect and love for the great leader.

The Congress welcomed these enthusiastic letters with enthusiastic applause.
