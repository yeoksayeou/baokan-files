Xinhua News Agency, September 18th. A report from Vientiane by Agence France-Presse states that before dawn today, Vientiane, the capital of Laos, was shelled, apparently from Thai territory. The shelling began at approximately 3:00 AM local time and lasted for about half an hour. After being met with retaliation from Lao government forces, the invaders fled under cover of darkness.

It is reported that previously, a unit of troops under Nosavan, supported by the United States and Thailand, also used mortars to bombard a Lao army camp south of Vientiane.

Since the establishment of the new Lao government headed by Phouma, Thailand, instigated and supported by the United States, has further intensified its various activities of interference in Laos. In addition to using its territory and the Mekong River to assist the Phoumi Nosavan group in Laos in mobilizing troops via water and land, and sending many officers as advisors to the Nosavan group, the Thai reactionary authorities have also repeatedly threatened to carry out armed intervention in Laos. Thai Prime Minister Sarit Thanarat and Thai Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defense Thanom Kittikachorn have successively made undisguised threats against Laos and ordered the strengthening of police forces stationed on the Thai-Lao border.

According to an Associated Press report from Savannakhet on the 17th, the Thai government is currently instigating Phoumi Nosavan to draft a "call" demanding direct intervention in Laos' internal affairs by the United Nations and the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization.

Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, September 19th. According to a broadcast from Vientiane Radio, the Lao government issued a communique on the 18th regarding the shelling of Vientiane from Thai territory, expressing a strong protest against this act of aggression.

The communique stated: "On September 18th, at 3:00 AM, mortar shells and machine-gun fire were launched from the Thai riverbank towards Vientiane. Some houses were damaged, but there were no deaths."

The communique emphasized that "the Lao government solemnly protests this unwarranted act of aggression. The Lao government believes that if such actions continue, they will threaten peace in the region."

The communique pointed out that the Thai riverbank has been used as a base for sabotage and aggression against Vientiane in the past week.

Before issuing this communique, Prime Minister Phouma summoned Zerwarg, the personal representative of UN Secretary-General Hammarskjöld. Prince Phouma has formally notified him of the acts of aggression from Thailand. According to Vientiane Radio, Zerwarg acknowledged that before hearing the mortar fire, he personally saw the flashes of artillery fire from the Thai side of the river opposite Vientiane.

According to Vientiane Radio today, the Lao government also issued a communique on September 18th, revealing new evidence of Thailand's blatant interference in Laos. The communique stated that at 4:00 PM on September 18th, Vientiane intercepted telegrams from the Thai command to the authorities in Savannakhet in Laos, and Nakhon Phanom, That Phanom, and Mukdahan in Thailand. The content stated that the routes between Mukdahan, Nakhon Phanom, Udon Thani, Nong Khai, and Si Chiang Mai were closed to the public, and only troops and police were allowed to travel.

The communique stated, "The above facts clearly prove Thailand's interference in the internal affairs of Laos."

According to an Associated Press report, Prime Minister Phouma told an Associated Press reporter on the same day that he was lodging a strong protest with the Thai government. If these attacks continue, he will ask the United Nations Security Council to take prompt remedial action.

He said, "Whether the attacking forces are Lao rebel forces or Thai forces, Thailand is responsible, because they are on Thai territory."

Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, September 18th. According to a broadcast by Vientiane Radio on the evening of the 17th, a unit of the Lao traitorous group Nosavan shelled the Zhi Naimo stronghold on the Mekong River, 40 kilometers south of Vientiane, with mortars from the evening of the 15th to 3:00 AM on the 16th. Due to the counterattack by the troops in the stronghold, Nosavan's troops were forced to flee in the boats that had brought them. They left behind a mortar. The radio said that the Lao local authorities are conducting an investigation to determine whether this unit came up the Mekong River or attacked from the Thai bank of the Mekong River. If the second hypothesis is true, the already strained relations between the Kingdom of Laos government and the Bangkok government will be further aggravated. Vientiane Radio also said in a broadcast today: Everyone knows that the Thai government has not yet recognized the Souvanna Phouma government, which was passed by the Lao National Assembly and approved by the King. At the same time, although Prime Minister Phouma has made efforts and the Thai government has assured that the border between the two countries will be reopened, the supplies needed by Laos are still being blocked and cannot be transported across the Mekong River. In Vientiane, people are surprised by this attitude.

The radio pointed out that the purpose of Thailand's economic blockade of Laos is to hinder all efforts made by the legitimate government of Laos to restore domestic order and tranquility. The radio said that a statement by Sarit Thanarat clearly illustrates this. Sarit Thanarat once said at a press conference that he would punish merchants who export goods to Vientiane.

    万象遭到来自泰国境内的炮击
    老挝政府向泰国提强烈抗议
    新华社18日讯　据法新社自万象报道，今天黎明前，老挝首都万象遭到了显然来自泰国境内的炮击。这次炮击从当地时间三时开始，持续了约半小时。侵略者在遭到老挝政府军队的还击以后，在黑暗中逃跑了。
    据报道，在这以前，受到美国和泰国支持的诺萨万的一支军队，曾经也用迫击炮对位于万象以南的老挝军队的一处军营进行了轰击。
    自以富马为首的老挝新政府成立以来，受到美国唆使和支持的泰国，进一步加紧了它对老挝进行干涉的各种活动。除了利用它的领土和湄公河，从水、陆两路帮助老挝的富米·诺萨万集团调动军队，并派出许多军官充当诺萨万集团的顾问外，泰国反动当局还连续威胁要对老挝进行武装干涉。泰国总理乃沙立和泰国副总理兼国防部长乃他侬·吉滴卡宗先后发表露骨地威胁老挝的讲话，并下令加强驻扎在泰国和老挝边境的警察部队。
    据美联社17日自沙湾拿吉报道，泰国政府日前正在唆使富米·诺萨万草拟一项“呼吁书”，要求联合国和东南亚条约组织直接干涉老挝内政。
    新华社河内19日电　据万象电台广播，老挝政府18日就来自泰国境内的炮火射击万象的事件发表公报，对这种侵略行动表示强烈的抗议。
    公报说：“在9月18日凌晨三点从泰国河岸向万象发射了迫击炮弹和机关枪。毁坏了一些房屋，没有人死亡。”
    公报强调说，“老挝政府严正抗议这种无端的侵略行动。老挝政府认为这种行动如果继续发生，将威胁这个地区的和平。”
    公报指出，泰国河岸在过去一周内已被用来作为对万象进行破坏和侵略的基地。
    在发表这个公报前，富马首相曾召见联合国秘书长哈马舍尔德的私人代表泽耳韦格。富马亲王已经把来自泰国的侵略行动正式通知他。据万象电台广播，泽耳韦格承认，他在听到迫击炮声之前，他亲眼看到了万象市对面泰国境内发炮的闪光。
    据万象电台今天广播，老挝政府9月18日还发表公报，揭露泰国明目张胆干涉老挝的新证据。公报说，9月18日16时，万象市收听到泰国指挥部发给老挝的沙湾拿吉和泰国的廊开、帕波、西川迈当局的电报。内容说，在木达汗、纳空发农、乌敦、廊开和西川迈的交通线禁止人民来往，只许军队和警察可以来往。
    这一公报说，上述事实明确的证明了泰国干涉老挝的内部事务。”
    据美联社报道，富马首相同一天对美联社记者说，他正在向泰国政府提出强烈抗议。如果继续进行这种攻击，他将要求联合国安全理事会迅速采取补救行动。
    他说，“不管攻击部队是老挝叛乱部队还是泰国部队，都要由泰国负责。因为他们在泰国领土上。”
    新华社河内18日电　据万象电台17日晚广播：老挝叛国集团诺萨万的一支部队曾在15日晚上到16日凌晨三时，用迫击炮向万象以南四十公里湄公河边的支乃莫据点开炮。由于据点里的军队的反击，诺萨万的军队被迫乘着把他们送来的船只逃走。他们留下来一门迫击炮。电台说，老挝地方当局正在进行调查，以确定这支部队是沿着湄公河上来的还是从泰国的湄公河岸进攻的。如果第二个假设是确实的话，老挝王国政府同曼谷政府之间已经紧张的关系就将更加恶化。万象电台今天在广播中还说：大家知道，泰国政府还没有承认得到老挝国会的通过、并由国王发布命令批准的梭发那·富马政府。同时，尽管富马首相曾经作出努力、泰国政府也曾经保证要重新开放两国边界，可是老挝需要的物资仍然被阻留，不能运过湄公河。在万象，人们对这种态度感到惊奇。
    电台指出，泰国对老挝实行经济封锁的目的，是要阻挠老挝合法政府为恢复国内秩序和安宁作出的一切努力。电台说，乃沙立发表的一项声明更清楚地说明了这一点。乃沙立曾经在一个记者招待会上说，他要使向万象输出货物的商人受到惩办。
