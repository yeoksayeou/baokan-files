    Taking Pride in Hard Work and Simplicity
    Cong Min
    Hard work and simplicity versus extravagance and wastefulness reflect two different class stances and different worldviews.
    Hard work and simplicity are the lifestyle of the laboring people, while extravagance and wastefulness are the lifestyle of the exploiting classes. The exploiting classes lead lives of unearned income, with clothes handed to them and food placed in their mouths. They not only do not understand the difficulty of acquiring material wealth, but also see riding on the backs of the laboring people, plundering vast amounts of wealth, and indulging in eating, drinking, and merrymaking as the joy and purpose of life. The laboring people, through their own labor, understand the hardships of creating material wealth, and therefore cherish every grain of rice and every thread. When they see extravagance and wastefulness, they feel heartache and resentment, because every item embodies the painstaking effort and sweat of their class brothers!
    A revolutionary fighter not only stands on the side of the proletariat, possesses deep feelings for the laboring people, and understands the importance of cherishing the fruits of their labor, but also treats the revolution with utmost loyalty, thinking of the proletarian cause of liberation, and doing great and serious work. What is their greatest joy and ultimate purpose in life? It is the continuous victory of the proletarian cause and the early realization of communism. With such a worldview and outlook on life, if the revolution requires it, they will not hesitate to sacrifice even their most precious lives, let alone material enjoyment?
    Look at the revolutionary memoirs written by those revolutionary predecessors. Our revolutionary predecessors lived such a hard material life in the era of Ruijin and the era of Yan'an. However, their spirit was always filled with revolutionary optimism, full of vigor, and high in fighting spirit. Because a revolutionary fighter looks ahead and has lofty ideals and noble sentiments, "worrying about the world's troubles before others, and enjoying the world's pleasures after others." Selflessness, hard work, dedication to public service, and diligent work are forever the true colors of proletarian revolutionary fighters.
    Lu Xun said, "Life is too comfortable, and work will be burdened by life." What a profound thought is contained in these simple words! Of course, we are no longer in the difficult years of climbing snowy mountains and crossing grasslands. The development of socialist construction has greatly improved our lives, but countless of our revolutionary veterans, loyal proletarian fighters, still maintain the simple lifestyle of the past. Maintaining and carrying forward our glorious revolutionary traditions, taking pride in hard work and simplicity, and feeling ashamed of extravagance and wastefulness, not only embodies a revolutionary's revolutionary integrity—revolutionary steadfastness—but its important significance is even more clearly stated by Comrade Fang Zhimin:
    A life of poverty, purity, and simplicity is precisely where we revolutionaries can overcome many difficulties!

    以艰苦朴素为荣
    丛民
    艰苦朴素和奢侈浪费反映了两种不同的阶级立场，不同的世界观。
    艰苦朴素是劳动人民的生活作风，奢侈浪费是剥削阶级的生活作风。剥削阶级过着不劳而获的生活，衣来伸手，饭来张嘴，不仅不懂得物质财富的来之不易，而且以骑在劳动人民头上，掠夺到大量财富，尽量吃喝玩乐为人生的乐趣和目的。劳动人民在亲身从事的劳动中，懂得创造物质财富的艰辛，因此珍惜着一粥一饭、一针一线。他们看到奢侈浪费，就感到心痛、愤恨，因为每一件物资都有着自己阶级弟兄所花的心血和汗水！
    一个革命战士，不仅站在无产阶级立场，有着深厚的劳动人民的感情，懂得珍惜劳动人民的劳动果实，而且对待革命，忠心耿耿，想的是无产阶级的解放事业，做的是伟大而严肃的工作。什么是他们人生的最大乐趣和最终目的？是无产阶级事业的不断胜利，是共产主义的早日实现。有了这样的世界观、人生观，如果革命需要，他们连自己最宝贵的生命也在所不惜，何况生活享受呢？
    看看那些革命前辈们写的革命回忆录吧。我们的革命前辈们，在瑞金时代，在延安时代，过的是多么艰苦的物质生活。然而，他们的精神却总是那样充满革命的乐观主义，生气勃勃，斗志昂扬。因为一个革命战士，眼看前方，有的是远大的理想，高尚的情操，“先天下之忧而忧，后天下之乐而乐”。大公无私，艰苦奋斗，克己奉公，埋头苦干，永远是无产阶级革命战士的本色。
    鲁迅说过：“生活太安逸了，工作就被生活所累了。”平易的话里，包含着多么深刻的思想！当然，我们现在并不处在爬雪山过草地的艰苦年代，社会主义建设的发展，使我们的生活大为改善了，但是，我们无数的革命老前辈们，忠实的无产阶级的战士们，仍然保持着过去那种简朴的生活作风。保持和发扬我们光荣的革命传统，以艰苦朴素为荣，以奢侈浪费为耻，这不仅体现了一个革命者的革命气节——革命的坚定性，它的重要意义，更如方志敏同志所说的：
    清贫，洁白朴素的生活，正是我们革命者能够战胜许多困难的地方！
