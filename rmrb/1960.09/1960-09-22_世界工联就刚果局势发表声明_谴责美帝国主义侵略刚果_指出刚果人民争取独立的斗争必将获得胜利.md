Xinhua News Agency, Prague, September 21st - The Secretariat of the World Federation of Trade Unions issued a statement here on the 20th regarding the situation in the Congo, reiterating the WFTU’s complete support for the struggle of the Congolese workers and people to defend their national independence and territorial integrity, and calling on workers and trade unions around the world to take all possible actions to express active support for the Congolese people and condemn the aggression of the colonialists and US imperialism.

The statement emphatically pointed out that the imperialists, under the leadership of the US government, have banded together to maintain their privileges and achieve the same goal: to destroy this new African nation by creating division, and to obstruct the Congolese people from becoming masters of their country’s vast wealth at all costs, thereby delivering a heavy blow to the entire African liberation movement. The statement went on to point out that to achieve this goal, they are capable of anything, including organizing and supporting coups and mutinies. And the greatest hypocrisy is the use of UN forces to serve the interests of imperialist monopoly capital and to grossly interfere in the legitimate government and parliament of the Congo.

The WFTU statement said: “The blatant violation of the sovereignty of the Congolese people under the leadership of US imperialism is a serious warning to other African leaders and countries, and a threat to the independence of other countries and to world peace.”

The statement praised the Congolese people and government, who, with the active support of the African people and all peace-loving and progressive forces around the world, are valiantly defending the integrity of their country and their future. The statement called on all workers and trade unions to resolutely condemn the aggression of the colonialists and US imperialism, and to stop these forces from profiting by using Congolese against Congolese and Africans against Africans. The WFTU concluded by expressing its belief: "As long as the workers and people of the Congo, Africa, and the world unite to launch a powerful struggle against the imperialist bloc headed by US imperialism, they will be able to thwart the plans of aggression and domination over the Congo and Africa, and ensure that the Congolese people and the people of other African countries achieve final victory in their struggle for complete independence."

    世界工联就刚果局势发表声明
　　谴责美帝国主义侵略刚果
    指出刚果人民争取独立的斗争必将获得胜利
    新华社布拉格21日电　世界工会联合会书记处20日在这里就刚果局势发表声明，重申世界工联完全支持刚果工人和人民保卫他们的民族独立和领土完整的斗争，并号召全世界工人和工会采取一切可能的行动来表示积极支持刚果人民，谴责殖民主义者和美帝国主义的侵略。
    声明着重指出，在美国政府领导下的帝国主义者已经纠集起来以便保持他们的特权和达到同一个目的：通过制造分裂摧毁这个新的非洲国家，不惜一切代价阻挠刚果人民成为自己国家的巨大财富的主人，从而对整个非洲的自由运动给予沉重的打击。声明接着指出，为达到目的，他们什么事情都干得出来，其中包括组织和支持政变和兵变。而最大的伪善就是利用联合国部队为帝国主义垄断资本的利益服务，并对刚果的合法政府和议会进行粗暴的干涉。
    世界工联的声明说：“在美帝国主义领导下对刚果人民主权的明目张胆的侵犯，是对其他非洲领袖和国家的严重警告，是对其他国家的独立和世界和平的威胁。”
    声明赞扬刚果人民和政府，他们在非洲人民以及全世界一切爱好和平和进步力量的积极支持下英勇地保卫国家的完整和他们的未来。声明呼吁全体工人和工会坚决谴责殖民主义者和美帝国主义的侵略，制止这些势力利用刚果人反对刚果人、非洲人反对非洲人而从中渔利。世界工联最后表示相信：“只要刚果、非洲和全世界的工人和人民联合起来，对以美帝国主义为首的帝国主义集团发动强有力的斗争，他们将能够挫败侵略、统治刚果和非洲的计划，并保证刚果人民和其他非洲国家人民争取完全独立的斗争取得最后的胜利。”
