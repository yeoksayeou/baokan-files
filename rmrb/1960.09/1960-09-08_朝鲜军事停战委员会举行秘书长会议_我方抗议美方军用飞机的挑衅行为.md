    Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, September 6th: The Korean Central News Agency, Kaesong, reported that the Secretaries' Meeting of both sides of the Korean Military Armistice Commission was held today based on the suggestion of the Korean-Chinese side. At the meeting, Colonel Lin Jiji, Secretary of the Korean-Chinese side, lodged a serious protest with the US side regarding the incident of US military aircraft violating the armistice agreement and once again intruding into the airspace of the Korean-Chinese side for hostile acts.

    The Secretary of the Korean-Chinese side pointed out at the meeting that at approximately 10:14 AM Pyongyang time on September 2, 1960, two US F-86 military jet aircraft flew from the US side's Yeoncheon area, crossed the military demarcation line in the airspace near Goyangdae in the demilitarized zone, and intruded into the airspace near Guicheon-ri in the military control area of the Korean-Chinese side. Afterwards, these two aircraft intruded into the airspace near Gimcheon and Tuseong within the area of the Korean-Chinese side, and then flew towards Gimpo in the US area via the vicinity of the confluence of the Lishui River and the Han River.

    The Secretary of the Korean-Chinese side pointed out that, disregarding the repeated protests and warnings from the Korean-Chinese side, the US side has dispatched four times for a total of six sorties of military aircraft to intrude into the airspace of the Korean-Chinese side for reconnaissance activities in the past month alone.

    The Secretary of the Korean-Chinese side emphasized that this provocative and hostile behavior by the US side is clear evidence that the US side completely disregards the armistice agreement. The Secretary of the Korean-Chinese side strongly demanded that the US side severely punish the personnel involved in this incident and strictly control US personnel to prevent such incidents from happening again.

    朝鲜军事停战委员会举行秘书长会议
    我方抗议美方军用飞机的挑衅行为
    新华社平壤6日电　朝鲜中央通讯社开城讯，朝鲜军事停战委员会双方秘书长会议根据朝中方面建议今天举行会议。朝中方面秘书长林箕济上校在会上就美方军用飞机违反停战协定，又一次侵入朝中方面地区上空进行敌对行为的事件，向美方提出了严重抗议。
    朝中方面秘书长在会上指出，1960年9月2日平壤时间十时十四分左右，美方F——86型军用喷气式飞机两架，由美方涟川方面飞来，在非军事区的高阳垈附近上空飞越军事分界线，侵入朝中方面军事控制地区的贵存里附近上空。以后，这两架飞机又侵入朝中方面地区内的金川、土城附近上空，又经礼成江和汉江汇合处附近上空飞往美方地区金浦方向。
    朝中方面秘书长指出，美方不顾朝中方面的一再抗议和警告，仅在最近一个月内就派遣了四次六架次军用飞机侵入朝中方面上空进行侦察活动。
    朝中方面秘书长强调说，美方的这种挑衅性敌对行为，是美方完全无视停战协定的明显的证据。朝中方面秘书长强硬要求美方严惩同这次事件有关的人员，并严格控制美方人员，使此类事件不再发生。
