This newspaper reports from Tianjin on September 9th: The Zhao Ge Zhuang Mine of Kailuan Coal Mine has conducted thorough and in-depth political education and ideological mobilization among the broad masses of workers in the movement to increase production and practice thrift. The broad masses of workers have further recognized the current excellent situation, clarified the direction of their struggle, and inspired greater revolutionary vigor. The Party's call has been transformed into the conscious action of the broad masses, making the movement to increase production and practice thrift colorful and vibrant, and production is thriving. In late August, the average daily output of raw coal increased by 4.04% compared with mid-August, and from September 1st to 5th, the average daily output of coal increased by another 0.84% compared with late August.

    **Extensively Publicizing the Situation and Assigning Tasks**

    At the beginning of the movement to increase production and practice thrift, the Zhao Ge Zhuang Mine first carried out a series of in-depth and meticulous political and ideological mobilization efforts among cadres, workers, and their families. The Secretary of the Mine's Party Committee adopted a method of going directly to the workers, making reports to them in each shift, day and night, explaining the situation and assigning tasks. For workers who did not hear the report at the beginning, the Party Committee Secretary also conducted multiple make-up sessions. More than 90% of workers and cadres directly heard the Secretary's report. At the same time, the Party Committee carried out publicity and education among the families of workers in different areas. In order to enable all mine workers to have a more thorough understanding of the current situation, in addition to generally organizing workers for multiple discussions, the Party Committee Secretary also held more than ten forums with workers, technicians, and grassroots cadres, and went deep into the workers' dormitories to chat with them. The mine organized more than 1,800 Party propagandists and activists, and organized a literary and artistic contingent of more than 1,100 people to carry out publicity in a big way inside and outside the factory, in the streets and alleys, so that the great significance of carrying out the movement to increase production and practice thrift centered on grain and steel was known to every household and everyone. After discussions and forums, all the mine workers and their families more clearly recognized the excellent situation of the sustained leap forward in national industrial and agricultural production, their horizons were broadened, and their confidence was strengthened. Based on the needs of the sustained increase in grain and steel production, they also realized the importance of increasing coal production. The workers were determined to become stronger and full of energy. "Everything is for producing more coal!" The miners wrote their determination into big-character posters, pledges, and guarantees, made them into poems, added paintings, and sent them to the Party Committee with gongs and drums. Suddenly, the entire mining area was filled with poems and paintings, and filled with enthusiasm. Wherever you went, you would be infected by a vigorous spirit full of a hundredfold confidence.

    **Fully Mobilizing the Masses to Dig Potential and Propose Measures**

    The Communist Party Committee of Kailuan Zhao Ge Zhuang Mine took advantage of the situation and immediately led the rising enthusiasm of the workers to discuss and formulate plans for increasing production and practicing thrift. The Mine's Party Committee convened a congress of worker representatives, and used the method of "combining the virtual and the real" to review the completion of the plan for the first seven months, summarize experiences, and formulate the mine's plan and measures for increasing production and practicing thrift. Then, the mine's plan for increasing production and practicing thrift was passed down level by level to districts, shifts, teams, and groups, not only delivering the plan, but also delivering the key points and measures, and mobilizing the workers to fully discuss them. In the discussions, the workers demonstrated a high sense of responsibility as masters of the country, enthusiastically offered suggestions and plans, and tried every means to tap potential, and formulated plans and measures for increasing production and practicing thrift for groups and individuals. Based on the problems of short drills and small blasting power, the Chai Xiu He tunneling team learned and promoted advanced experiences such as using three-meter-long drills to make holes and crevice slotting, which increased blasting efficiency by more than 30%. In order to make full use of working hours, the workers studied and developed parallel operations such as drilling holes and supporting, which simplified production procedures. The workers of the He Ren mining team, in response to key production issues such as low coal extraction rate, launched an activity for everyone to contribute a clever plan. After the workers' painstaking research and experimentation, they reformed the coal mining method, prevented gangue from pressing on the coal, and increased the coal extraction rate, which can greatly increase output. The workers also came up with methods to open more coal eyes and shorten the moving time of drilling machines, which accelerated the speed of coal extraction and reduced auxiliary time. Each mining area and tunneling area also formed a plan review team composed of leading cadres, veteran workers, and production backbones to review the plans of each group and individual, and specifically help study measures to achieve the plans. Through these activities, most of the groups and individuals achieved advanced indicators, specific measures, competition opponents, and advanced experiences to learn and promote. The plans set by each group are generally 10% to 20% higher than the plans assigned by the leaders. In this way, the mine's production plan is based on the "five guarantees" of individual guarantees for the group, group guarantees for the working face, working face guarantees for the area, area guarantees for the mine, and transportation guarantees for production.

    **Backward Catching Up with Advanced, Advanced Helping Backward**

    "What is said must be done." The miners' exuberant political enthusiasm has been transformed into practical actions to increase production and practice thrift. The miners of the smallest No. 41 mining area first put forward the slogan of "small exceeding big" and "one equaling two." This heroic action quickly spread to every corner of the mine. From the mining area to the working face, from underground to above ground, a competition was launched to strive for small areas to exceed large areas, small working faces to exceed large working faces, slow hands to exceed fast hands, backward to exceed advanced, and night shifts to exceed day shifts, chasing each other and refusing to give in. In order to surpass the No. 61 mining area, which had one-third more people than themselves, the workers in the No. 41 mining area launched twelve forms of competition among the thirty-nine production groups. In order to produce more coal, the night shift workers who were specifically responsible for electrical and mechanical work and roadway maintenance launched a competition for night shifts to exceed day shifts. After calculating the accounts, the electrical and mechanical maintenance team readjusted the labor organization and implemented a system of responsibility for maintaining equipment on a contracted basis by working face. The maintenance task that originally required eight hours to complete was completed in only three hours. After carrying out a heated competition, the average daily output of this mining area in late August not only surpassed its competition opponent, the No. 61 mining area, but also jumped from the seventh place in the mine's output to the fourth place. After the workers in the four shifts of the tunneling No. 2 area launched a counterpart competition, the Tian Jin Kao team in the first shift first broke through the planned target, reaching 2.6 meters per shift; the Liu Zhen Sheng team in the second shift improved the operating methods, reaching 4.2 meters per shift. The next day, the Tian Jin Kao team studied the experience of the Liu Zhen Sheng team and tried to save material transportation time, and the tunneling footage was increased to 6.1 meters. In the competition, the communist style of going forward when difficulties are encountered and helping the backward is becoming more and more common. The ten most advanced pacesetters in the mine voluntarily signed up to form an advanced experience dissemination team, and went to the 98 groups in the mining area and tunneling area to perform live demonstrations and impart 75 effective advanced experiences, so that more than 40 groups caught up with the production level of the pacesetters.

    **Grasping Management, Grasping Life, Sustained Leap Forward**

    After the new upsurge of the mine's production increase and thrift practice competition, some new topics were raised for enterprise management. This requires further improvement of management work in order to better adapt to the needs of the development of the new situation. The mine mobilized the masses to hold forums and speak freely, conducted a major inspection of the mine's management work, and put forward many opinions for further improving management work. Based on the problems identified in the inspection and the suggestions of the workers, the mine's leaders formed a professional team to convene forums of veteran workers, technicians, management personnel, and leading cadres from relevant departments to put forward preliminary opinions on revising certain management systems, and then submitted them to the workers for discussion and modification, further strengthening the twelve management systems such as safety inspection, maintenance of mechanical and electrical equipment, the three-level responsibility system for districts, shifts, and groups, and the day and night duty of leading cadres, and promoting the in-depth development of the production increase and thrift practice movement. After the mine established and improved a complete set of mechanical and electrical equipment maintenance systems such as patrol inspection, chart preparation, leadership inspection, fixed drivers, and fixed maintenance time according to the opinions of the masses, the mechanical and electrical maintenance workers and the mining workers helped each other and cooperated closely, so that the equipment was better maintained, ensuring the continued rise in production.

    In the booming movement to increase production and practice thrift, the mine's Party Committee paid attention to grasping production on the one hand and grasping life on the other, so that the masses were always energetic and maintained full enthusiasm for production. The Mine's Party Committee designated a Party Committee Deputy Secretary and a Mine Director to be in charge of workers' lives, going deep into the canteens to specifically help management personnel and cooks further improve canteen management and service attitudes, and further improve the quality of meals; going deep into the workers' dormitories to help the workers' families arrange their lives. The Party organizations from the mine to the mining areas paid attention to ensuring that workers worked, rested, and studied on time, and had both work and leisure. This further stimulated the production enthusiasm of the broad masses of workers. Everyone tried every means to improve production methods, promote advanced experiences, tap potential, improve production efficiency, and make full use of working hours to produce more coal to support the leap forward in steel production.

    增产节约的意义家喻户晓
    全力为钢的劲头越来越大
    赵各庄煤矿发动群众好生产步步高
    本报天津9日电　开滦煤矿赵各庄矿在增产节约运动中，全面深入地进行了政治教育和思想发动工作。广大职工群众进一步认清了当前大好形势，明确了奋斗方向，鼓起了更大的革命干劲，党的号召变成了广大群众的自觉行动，使增产节约运动开展得有声有色，生产蒸蒸日上。8月下旬，原煤的平均日产量比中旬提高了4.04％，9月1至5日煤的平均日产量又比8月下旬提高了0.84％。
    大张旗鼓地讲形势交任务
    赵各庄矿在增产节约运动开始时，首先在干部、工人和职工家属中进行了一系列的深入细致的政治思想发动工作。矿党委书记采取一竿子插到底的办法，按日夜各班直接向工人作报告，讲形势，交任务。开始没有听到报告的工人，党委书记还分别进行了多次的补课。90％以上的工人和干部，直接听到了书记的报告。同时，党委分片向职工家属进行了宣传教育。为了使全矿职工对当前形势了解得更透彻，除普遍组织职工进行多次讨论以外，党委书记还分别召开了十多次工人、技术人员和基层干部的座谈会，并深入到职工宿舍同工人漫谈。全矿组织了一千八百多名党的宣传员和积极分子，组织了一千一百多人的文艺大军，在厂内厂外，街头巷尾，大张旗鼓地进行宣传，使开展以粮、钢为中心的增产节约运动的重大意义作到家喻户晓，人人皆知。全矿职工和职工家属经过讨论、座谈，更加认清了全国工农业生产持续跃进的大好形势，眼界更加开阔，信心更加充足。他们还根据粮、钢持续增产的需要，更加认识到增产煤炭的重要性。职工们人人发愤图强，浑身是劲。“一切为了多出煤！”矿工们把自己的决心写成大字报、决心书、保证书，作成诗，配上画，敲锣打鼓地送到党委会。顿时，整个矿区诗画满墙，热气腾腾。无论走到哪里，都会被一股充满着百倍信心的蓬勃朝气所感染。
    充分发动群众挖潜力提措施
    中共开滦赵各庄矿委员会因势利导，立即把职工群众高涨的热情引向讨论和制定增产节约计划。矿党委召开了职工代表大会，以“虚实结合”的方法，检查了前七个月完成计划的情况，总结了经验，订出了全矿的增产节约计划和措施。接着，把全矿的增产节约计划逐级下达到区、班、队、组，不仅交计划，也交关键，交措施，发动职工充分讨论。工人们在讨论中，表现了高度主人翁的责任感，热烈献计献策，千方百计挖掘潜力，订出小组和个人的增产节约计划和措施。柴秀合掘进小组根据钎子短，爆破力量小的问题，学习和推广了三米长钎子打眼和缝隙掏槽等先进经验，爆破效率提高30％以上。为了充分利用工时，工人们研究出打眼、支架等平行作业的办法，简化了生产工序。何忍采煤小组的工人针对煤炭采出率低等生产关键问题，开展了人人献一手妙计的活动，经过工人苦心研究和试验，改革了采煤方法，防止了?石压煤，提高了煤炭的采出率，可以大大增加产量。工人们还想出多开放煤眼和缩短移动钻机时间的方法，加快了出煤的速度，减少了辅助时间。各个采煤区和掘进区还由领导干部、老工人和生产骨干组成计划审查小组，逐个审查小组和个人的计划，具体帮助研究实现计划的措施。经过这些活动，绝大部分小组和个人，作到了有先进指标，有具体措施，有竞赛对手，有学习推广的先进经验。各小组定的计划一般都比领导交给的计划高10％到20％。这样，就使全矿生产计划建立在个人保小组、小组保掌子、掌子保区、区保矿、运输保生产的“五保证”的基础上。
    后进赶先进　先进帮后进
    “说到就一定要作到。”矿工们奔放的政治热情变成了威力巨大的增产节约的实际行动。这个矿最小的四一采煤区的矿工，首先提出了“小超大”、“一顶二”的口号。这一豪迈的行动迅速波及到全矿各个角落。从采煤区到掌子面，从井下到井上，展开了力争小区超大区、小掌子超大掌子、慢手超快手、后进超先进、夜班超白班的竞赛，你追我赶，各不相让。四一采煤区的工人为了超过比自己人数多三分之一的六一采煤区，在三十九个生产小组中开展了十二种形式的竞赛。为了多出煤，专门负责机电、巷道维修工作的夜班工人们，开展了夜班超白班的竞赛。机电维修组经过算账，重新调整了劳动组织，实行分掌子包干负责维修设备，原来需要用八个小时才能完成的维修任务，只用了三个小时就全部干完了。这个采煤区经过开展热火朝天的竞赛，8月下旬的平均日产量不但超过了自己的竞赛对手六一采煤区，而且由全矿产量的第七位一跃而为第四位。掘进二区四个班的工人展开对口赛以后，第一班田进考小组首先突破了计划指标，达到班进二点六米；第二班刘振声小组改进了操作方法，达到班进四点二米。第二天田进考小组研究了刘振声小组的经验，设法节省了运料时间，掘进进尺又提高到六点一米。在竞赛中，见困难就上，见后进就帮的共产主义风格蔚然成风。全矿十名最先进的标兵自动报名组成了先进经验传播队，分别到采煤区、掘进区九十八个小组作现场表演，传授了七十五项行之有效的先进经验，使四十多个小组赶上了标兵的生产水平。
    抓管理　抓生活　持续跃进
    全矿增产节约竞赛的新高潮出现以后，给企业管理工作提出了一些新的课题。这就要求管理工作进一步改进，以便更好地适应新形势发展的需要。这个矿发动群众座谈鸣放，对全矿管理工作进行了一次大检查，提出了不少进一步改进管理工作的意见。这个矿的领导方面根据检查出来的问题和职工的建议，组成专业小组，分别召开有关部门的老工人、技术人员、管理人员和领导干部的座谈会，提出修订某些管理制度的初步意见，然后交职工群众讨论修改，进一步加强了安全检查、机电设备维修、区班组三级责任制和领导干部昼夜值班等十二项管理制度，促进了增产节约运动的深入开展。这个矿根据群众的意见，建立和健全了巡回检查、图表制修、领导巡视、固定司机、固定检修时间等一整套机电设备维修制度以后，机电维修工人和采掘工人互相帮助，紧密配合，使设备维修得更好，保证了生产持续上升。
    在轰轰烈烈的增产节约运动中，这个矿的党委注意一手抓生产，一手抓生活，使群众经常精力充沛，保持了饱满的生产热情。矿党委确定一名党委副书记和一名矿长专管职工生活，深入到食堂，具体帮助管理人员、炊事人员进一步改进食堂管理工作和服务态度，进一步提高饭菜质量；深入到职工宿舍，帮助职工家属安排生活。从矿到各采煤区的党组织都注意切实保证工人按时工作、休息和学习，有劳有逸。这就更激发了广大职工的生产热情。大家都千方百计改进生产方法，推广先进经验，挖掘潜力，提高生产效率，充分利用工时，为支援钢铁跃进多产煤炭。
