A Magnificent Battle Against Disaster

In early August, the eastern Liaoning area centered on Fushun, Benxi, and Liaoyang, and the western Jilin area centered on Tonghua, were hit by an extraordinary flood. Under the leadership and concern of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, and with the support of the people of the whole country, the Liaoning and Jilin Provincial Committees of the Communist Party of China led the people of the two provinces, especially the urban and rural people in the disaster areas, in a magnificent battle against the flood. Now, the flood has subsided, production has quickly recovered, and the people of Liaoning and Jilin have victoriously withstood the test of a rare, extraordinarily large flood peak. We would like to extend our heartfelt respect to the people of Liaoning and Jilin who overcame the flood with great revolutionary will, and to all those who have contributed to supporting the disaster relief efforts of the people of Liaoning and Jilin!

This extraordinary flood was unprecedented in the history of the Liaoning and Jilin areas. Due to the impact of the fifth typhoon in the Pacific landing on the Liaodong Peninsula at the end of July, the Liaodong area centered on Fushun, Benxi, and Liaoyang, and the western Jilin area centered on Tonghua, experienced continuous torrential rains in early August. The water levels of the Hun River, the Taizi River, and other tributaries of the Liao River in Liaoning Province, and the Nen River, the Hun River, the Tao'er River, and other rivers in Jilin Province, rose sharply, and flood peaks appeared one after another. Under the sudden attack of this extraordinary natural disaster, due to the role of a large number of new water conservancy projects in flood control and interception, due to the full flood prevention preparations made by the two provinces in advance, and due to the heroic struggle organized by the people after the flood arrived, "the devil is one foot tall, the road is ten feet tall," the scope and extent of the disaster were greatly reduced and mitigated, and the industrial and agricultural production and the safety of the people in most areas were effectively guaranteed. However, due to the relatively wide area of the torrential rain and the rapid flow of water, some areas suffered different degrees of disaster. Some crops and villages in the Hun River, Taizi River, and other river areas were flooded, and some sections of important railway lines such as Shenyang to Jilin, Shenyang to Dalian, and Shenyang to Andong were damaged by the flood. The production of industrial and mining enterprises in Anshan, Benxi, Fushun, Tonghua, and other places was also partially affected. The average rainfall in the Anshan area from August 1st to 3rd reached 280 millimeters, of which 80% of the rainfall was concentrated in one day, and the rainfall greatly exceeded the highest record in history, so that the two major iron mines in East Anshan and Dagushan successively stopped production. Fushun was the first area to be hit by the flood. In just six or seven hours on the afternoon of August 1st, the rainfall reached 180 millimeters. On the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th, there was torrential rain again, threatening the Fushun Coal Mine with floods that had never been seen in the 50 years since the mine was built. Water suddenly accumulated in the open-pit mine, and the amount of groundwater gushing out from the underground operation mining areas increased greatly due to the infiltration of rainwater from the ground, and some coal mining faces were forced to stop production.

This major flood occurred at a time when the general line, the Great Leap Forward, and the people's communes were deeply rooted in the hearts of the people. Difficulties cannot scare the awakened and organized people. As some comrades said, "This flood has come to us as a negative teacher." It is a serious test for the more than 20 million people of Liaoning and the more than 10 million people of Jilin. Liaoning and Jilin are both one of China's largest industrial bases, especially Liaoning Province's steel and coal production has a pivotal influence in the country. Whether the people of these two provinces can quickly win the battle against the flood has a considerable impact on the completion of the national economic plan. The people of Liaoning and Jilin deeply realized the significance of this struggle, and rushed to the front line of flood resistance and disaster relief, fully demonstrating the fearless revolutionary heroism of the Chinese people under the leadership of the Communist Party of China. On the banks of the rapid Hun River, by the roaring Taizi River, on the Nen River, and on the Tao'er River, despite the rising water level day and night, people rushed ahead of the flood and raised the dams section by section. Once a breach occurred, a human dam would instantly block the flood. Once a flood occurred, aid from all directions would immediately rescue the people in distress. In steel factories, coal mines, power plants, and production posts in various industries, people insisted on both fighting the disaster and producing. Units that were forced to reduce production due to the severity of the disaster launched a tenacious struggle against the flood and restored production as quickly as possible. The twelve large and small mines of the Tonghua Mining Bureau that were flooded were basically restored to production after only two days and nights of rescue. The factories and mines in Anshan, Benxi, Fushun, and other places that were destroyed were also restored to production in a very short period of time. No matter how big the flood was, it was finally no match for the revolutionary will of the people to overcome the flood. The people of Liaoning and Jilin have written a glorious page in the history of fighting against natural disasters with invincible revolutionary strength. Now, the industrial and mining enterprises and transportation lines damaged by the flood have been basically restored under the vigorous rescue of the people, production has returned to normal, and some have exceeded the pre-disaster daily production level.

The victory of the people of Liaoning and Jilin in fighting the flood once again proves the truth that man will conquer nature, and proves the great subjective dynamic role of the masses of the people. The phrase "floods and wild beasts" illustrates how great the destructive power of floods is. Storms, heavy rains, and floods are objective phenomena in nature; however, in the face of the liberated Chinese people, floods can no longer run rampant as they did in the past. The size of the flood damage and whether production in the disaster area can be quickly restored also depends to a large extent on whether the subjective dynamic role of the masses of the people is fully exerted. Why can the people of the Liaodong area and the western Jilin area overcome this extraordinary flood and enable production in the disaster area to be rapidly restored in a short period of time? The most fundamental reason is that the Party has mobilized the strength of the broad masses of the people.

In the struggle against the flood, the people of Liaoning and Jilin were all "preparing for the worst and striving for the best." "Preparing for the worst and striving for the best" is a dialectical unity of despising difficulties strategically and valuing difficulties tactically. Without despising difficulties strategically and having the ambition to strive for the best, it is impossible to overcome the flood. Without valuing difficulties tactically and preparing for the worst, one will also suffer losses. "A thousand-mile dike can be destroyed by an anthill." In doing any work, it is necessary to grasp every detail and solve every specific problem in a down-to-earth manner in order to achieve the expected results. The subjective initiative of the masses of the people is precisely through the solution of these specific problems that it acts on objective reality. This is another important revelation that the people of Liaoning and Jilin have given us in overcoming the flood.

The struggle of the people of Liaoning and Jilin against the flood has ended victoriously with the flood subsiding and production rapidly recovering. In this struggle, the heroic image of the people of Liaoning and Jilin and the rich experience they have gained are also of profound significance to our future production struggles. In the nationwide campaign to increase production and practice economy centered on grain and steel, all employees on the industrial and transportation fronts must learn from the spirit and experience of the people of Liaoning and Jilin in fighting the flood, muster greater revolutionary energy, solve every specific problem, and strive to overfulfill this year's state plan!

    一场气势雄伟的抗灾战斗
     8月初，以抚顺、本溪、辽阳为中心的辽宁东部地区和以通化为中心的吉林西部地区，遭受到一次特大洪水的袭击。中共辽宁省委和吉林省委在中央的领导和关怀下，在全国人民的支持下，领导两省人民、特别是灾区的城乡人民，同洪水展开了一场气势雄伟的战斗。现在，洪水低头了，生产迅速恢复了，辽宁和吉林人民胜利地经受了一次罕见的特大洪峰的考验。我们谨向用伟大的革命意志战胜了洪水的辽宁和吉林人民，和一切为支援辽宁和吉林人民的抗灾斗争贡献过力量的人们致以衷心的敬意！
    这次特大洪水，是辽宁和吉林地区历史上从来不曾有过的。由于7月底太平洋第五号台风在辽东半岛登陆的影响，以抚顺、本溪、辽阳为中心的辽东地区和以通化为中心的吉林西部地区，8月初连降暴雨，辽宁境内浑河、太子河等辽河的支流和吉林境内嫩江、浑江、洮儿河等江河的水位猛涨，相继出现了洪峰。在这种特大自然灾害的突然袭击下，由于大批新的水利工程发挥了防洪截流的作用，由于两个省在事先都做了充分的防汛准备，和在水灾到来之后组织人民进行了英勇的搏斗，“魔高一尺，道高一丈”，使受灾范围和程度大大缩小和减轻，大部分地区的工农业生产和人民的安全得到有效的保障。但是，由于这次暴雨的面积比较广，雨大水急，也有部分地区造成了程度不同的灾害。浑河、太子河等沿河地区有一些庄稼和村屯被洪水淹没，沈阳到吉林、沈阳到大连、沈阳到安东等重要铁路干线的部分线路被洪水冲坏，鞍山、本溪、抚顺、通化等地工矿企业的生产也受到部分的影响。鞍山地区8月1日到3日平均降雨量达到二百八十毫米，其中80％的雨量又是集中在一天降落的，降雨量大大超过了历史上的最高纪录，以致东鞍山、大孤山两大铁矿先后停产。抚顺是这次最先受到洪水袭击的地区，仅8月1日下午的六、七个小时内，降雨量即达一百八十毫米，2日、3日、4日又是暴雨如注，使抚顺煤矿遭受到建矿五十年来从未有过的洪水威胁，露天矿内骤然积水，各井下作业的矿区也因地面雨水下渗，地下涌水量大大增加，部分采煤工作面被迫停产。
    这次大水灾是发生在总路线、大跃进和人民公社深入人心的时候，困难吓不倒觉醒了和组织起来的人民。正如有些同志所说的那样，“这场洪水是给我们当反面教员来了”，它是对两千多万辽宁人民和一千多万吉林人民的一次严重的考验。辽宁和吉林都是我国最大的工业基地之一，特别是辽宁省的钢和煤的生产在全国具有举足轻重的影响。这两个省的人民能不能尽快地在同洪水搏斗中取得胜利，对于全国国民经济计划的完成有着相当的影响。辽宁和吉林人民深刻地认识到这场斗争的意义，争先恐后、奋不顾身地奔向抗洪抢险的最前线，集中表现出中国人民在中国共产党领导下大无畏的革命英雄主义。在急湍的浑河两岸，在咆哮的太子河旁，在嫩江、在洮儿河，尽管水位日夜猛涨，人们还是赶在洪水的前面，把堤坝节节加高。一旦决口，霎时间就是一座人堤挡住洪水；一旦水淹，来自四面八方的支援立即就把遇险的人们救离险境。在钢铁厂、在煤矿、在发电厂、在各行各业的生产岗位上，人们都坚持一边抢险一边生产。灾情严重，被迫减产的单位，更同洪水展开了顽强的斗争，用最快的速度恢复生产。通化矿务局被水淹的十二个大小矿井，只经过两昼夜的抢救就基本上恢复了生产。鞍山、本溪、抚顺等地受毁的厂矿，也是在很短的时间内就恢复生产的。洪水再大，终于大不过人民战胜洪水的革命意志。辽宁和吉林人民用不可战胜的革命力量，在同自然灾害作斗争的历史上写下了辉煌的一页。现在被洪水损坏的工矿企业、交通线路，在人民大力抢救下，已经基本复旧，生产已经恢复正常，有些已超过灾前的日产水平。
    辽宁和吉林人民同洪水搏斗的胜利，再一次证明了人定胜天的真理，证明了人民群众巨大的主观能动作用。“洪水猛兽”，这句话说明了洪水的破坏力量是多么巨大。狂风暴雨、洪水泛滥，这是自然界的客观现象；但是，在解放了的中国人民面前，洪水再也不能像过去那样肆意为虐了。洪水为害的大小，灾区的生产能不能尽快地恢复，也在很大程度上决定于人民群众的主观能动作用是不是得到充分发挥。为什么辽东地区和吉林西部地区人民能战胜这次特大洪水，使受灾地区的生产能够在很短的时期内迅速恢复起来呢？最根本的原因，就是党把广大人民群众的力量动员起来了。
    辽宁和吉林人民在同洪水斗争中，都是“从最坏处准备，向最好处努力”的。“从最坏处准备，向最好处努力”，是在战略上藐视困难和在战术上重视困难的辩证的统一。没有在战略上藐视困难，向最好处努力的雄心壮志，是斗不过洪水的。不在战术上重视困难，从最坏处准备，也是要吃亏的。“千里金堤，溃于一穴”。做任何工作，必须把每一个细节都抓住，把每一个具体问题都切切实实地解决了，才能得到预期的效果。人民群众的主观能动性，正是通过对这些具体问题的解决，作用于客观实际的。这是辽宁和吉林人民战胜洪水给我们的另一个重要启示。
    辽宁和吉林人民同洪水的斗争，以洪水低头、生产迅速恢复而胜利地结束了。在这场斗争中，辽宁和吉林人民的英雄形象和他们所取得的丰富的经验，对于我们今后的生产斗争也有深刻的意义。在以粮、钢为中心的全民增产节约运动中，工业交通战线上的全体职工要学习辽宁人民和吉林人民同洪水搏斗的精神和经验，鼓足更大的革命干劲，解决每一个具体问题，力争超额完成今年的国家计划！
