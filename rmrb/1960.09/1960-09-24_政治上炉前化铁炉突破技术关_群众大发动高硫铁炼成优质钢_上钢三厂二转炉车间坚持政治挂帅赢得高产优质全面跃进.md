Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, September 23rd: The workers of the No. 2 Converter Workshop of Shanghai Steel Plant No. 3, persisting in putting politics in command, vigorously engaging in mass movements, and conscientiously and practically promoting new technologies, have seen a continuous and comprehensive leap forward in steel production this year. They have raised a bright red flag in the struggle to seize high-quality and high-yield steel on China's steel front. The achievements and experiences they have gained have made important contributions to further leveraging the power of China's "small-scale and localized" steel enterprises and developing China's converter steelmaking technology.

This workshop is a large-scale converter workshop newly built in the process of developing converter steelmaking with low investment and fast construction nationwide in 1958. The pig iron it uses is almost entirely supplied by the small blast furnaces that have been developed in large numbers in various places since the whole people ran iron and steel. This year, they broke through technical barriers and adopted new technologies to not only refine steel, refine good steel, but also refine high-quality steel and silicon steel from high-sulfur pig iron, which the rolling mill workshop used to roll out high-quality medium plates, thin plates, and various types of steel. Due to high yield, high quality, low consumption, and long furnace life, this workshop has ranked first in the city's competition and evaluation of all large-scale converter workshops every month since the beginning of this year. In eight and a half months, their total steel output was 20,000 to 60,000 tons more than other large-scale converter workshops; the qualified rate has been around 96% to 98%, and the first-class product rate has been between 60% and 80%; the iron consumption is only more than 1,200 kilograms, and the lowest time is only more than 1,100 kilograms; the furnace life of the converter is also the longest. In the most recent month and a half, the desulfurization efficiency in the furnace of this workshop's pig iron furnace has generally been above 67%; the average melting rate in the first half of September was as high as 17.5 tons, and one production cycle of No. 1 pig iron furnace was as high as 19.6 tons.

The Ministry of Metallurgical Industry attaches great importance to the achievements and experience of the No. 2 Converter Workshop of Shanghai Steel Plant No. 3. It once convened a forum for grassroots leading cadres of key converter workshops across the country to exchange experiences here, calling on all localities to vigorously promote it.

The main reason why this workshop has achieved these achievements is because it has implemented the Party's leadership and the mass movement in combination, "politics in front of the furnace," thereby inspiring the worker masses to improve their revolutionary consciousness. The cadres of the workshop's Party branch went to the furnace to do political and ideological work, and mobilized the masses to do ideological work, so that the workers and masses often recognized the major significance of the domestic and international situation and the comprehensive completion of the national plan. This workshop was the first to implement the "furnace contracting system" among all steel plants in the city. Under the centralized leadership of the plant, the production of the entire furnace was handed over to a group of workers to be specifically responsible, and part of the technical management power originally controlled by the workshop was also delegated to the workers themselves, allowing the masses to be masters of their own affairs in technology, so the workers' sense of responsibility as masters was further strengthened. In July, the leaders decided that the No. 1 pig iron furnace in the workshop would be used as a national experimental furnace to attack the technical barriers of alkaline hot air pig iron furnaces, and the workers and masses in the workshop were greatly encouraged. In particular, the workers of Furnace No. 1, with the spirit of "taking the world as their responsibility," regarded their furnace as the vanguard of attacking high sulfur and seizing high yield on the steel front, and launched a tenacious struggle in all aspects. They were as united as one person, went up whenever there was difficulty, and rushed to do the most difficult work. The workers of other furnaces also regarded the designation of Furnace No. 1 as a national experimental furnace as a collective honor. Once, the molten iron in Furnace No. 1 was about to fill the ladle, and four workers, holding mud guns, rushed up one by one to block the taphole, but none of them blocked it. In this emergency, the workers of the adjacent Furnace No. 2 immediately grabbed the four mud guns they had prepared and rushed over to help, and it was not until the last one was inserted that the taphole was blocked, avoiding the "full ladle" accident. Thanks to the concerted efforts of the workers, Furnace No. 1 quickly raised the red flag, creating many good experiences for various places, and the other furnaces in the workshop also chased hard and caught up.

In leading the struggle to refine high-quality steel with high-sulfur pig iron, the workshop's Party branch resolutely supported the workers' desire to break through technical barriers and adopt new technologies. The methods they adopted were: if the ideology is unified, then do it; if it is not unified, then debate it; if the debate is not good, then experiment; if the experiment is not good, then study and experiment again, so as to ensure the implementation of various new technologies. Changing the pig iron furnace from acidic to alkaline is an extremely important technical measure to improve the desulfurization efficiency of the pig iron furnace and open up the road to high yield and high quality of the converter, and the workers demanded that it be adopted quickly. However, a few cadres were not determined enough, fearing that the operation would be difficult to master. Some suggested using alkalinity when the sulfur content of pig iron was high, and acidity when it was slightly lower, and some proposed adopting a compromise method of neutral operation. The Party branch organized cadres to engage in theoretical study, so that everyone further clarified the great significance of changing to an alkaline furnace and reached a consensus. Then, the cadres, together with the workers, first experimented on the No. 2 pig iron furnace, and the desulfurization effect was very good. Soon, all the pig iron furnaces in the entire workshop were changed to alkaline. After the pig iron furnaces were generally changed to alkaline, it was necessary to adopt the new operating technology of "full wind and sufficient pressure" to increase the melting rate of the furnace. However, after the amount of wind entering the furnace increased, problems such as material removal, scaffolding, and iron knots in the furnace appeared, affecting normal production. The Party branch organized cadres for theoretical study several times to help them treat new contradictions with a positive and balanced attitude. The cadres and the masses found the key to the problem together, and the workers in front of and behind the furnace were organized to fully ensure that the pig iron furnace "eats well and eats well," so that the new technology of "full wind and sufficient pressure" was quickly promoted, and the iron melting rate of the pig iron furnace also increased step by step.

Some of the main leading cadres of this workshop used to work in the army and rural areas for a long time, and some were mechanical workers. Although they did not know much about converter steelmaking technology, they firmly believed in the power of the masses, and as a result, complex technical problems were solved. (Attached picture)

### 政治上炉前化铁炉突破技术关  群众大发动高硫铁炼成优质钢  上钢三厂二转炉车间坚持政治挂帅赢得高产优质全面跃进

　　政治上炉前化铁炉突破技术关
　  群众大发动高硫铁炼成优质钢
    上钢三厂二转炉车间坚持政治挂帅赢得高产优质全面跃进
    据新华社上海23日电　上海第三钢铁厂第二转炉车间职工坚持政治挂帅，大搞群众运动，认真踏实地推行新技术，今年以来钢的生产出现了持续全面大跃进的局面，在我国钢铁战线夺取优质高产的斗争中，举起了一面鲜艳的红旗。它所取得的成就和创造的经验，对进一步发挥我国“小洋群”钢铁企业的威力和发展我国转炉炼钢技术都作出了重要贡献。
    这个车间是1958年全国大量发展投资省、建设快的转炉炼钢过程中新建起来的一个大型转炉车间，它所使用的生铁，几乎全部是全民办钢铁以来各地大量发展起来的小高炉供应的。今年，他们突破了技术关，采用了新技术，用含硫较高的生铁不仅炼成了钢，炼成了好钢，而且炼成了优质钢和矽钢，供轧钢车间轧出了质地优良的中板、薄板和各种型钢。由于高产、优质、低耗和炉龄长，这个车间在全市所有大型转炉车间的竞赛评比中，今年以来月月名列第一。八个半月中，他们的钢的总产量比其它大型转炉车间多出二万多吨到六万多吨；合格率一直在96％到98％左右，一级品率在60％到80％之间；铁耗只有一千二百多公斤，最低的时候只有一千一百多公斤；转炉的炉龄也最长。最近一个半月，这个车间的化铁炉炉内去硫效率一般都在67％以上；9月上半月的熔化率平均高达十七点五吨，一号化铁炉一个生产周期还高达十九点六吨。
    冶金工业部对上海第三钢铁厂第二转炉车间的成绩和经验极为重视，曾经召集全国重点转炉车间的基层领导干部在这里举行经验交流座谈会，号召各地大力推广。
    这个车间取得这些成就，主要是因为贯彻执行了党的领导和大搞群众运动相结合的方针，“政治上炉前”，从而激发工人群众提高了革命自觉。车间党总支的干部到炉前去作政治思想工作，并且发动群众做思想工作，使职工群众经常认清国内外大局和全面完成国家计划的重大意义。这个车间在全市各钢铁厂中首先实行了“包炉制”，在厂部的集中领导下，把整座炉子的生产交给一批职工专门负责，并把原来由车间掌握的部分技术管理权力，也下放给职工自己掌握，让群众在技术上当家作主，所以工人群众的主人翁责任感更加加强。7月份，车间里一号化铁炉被领导方面确定作为猛攻碱性热风化铁炉技术关的全国试验炉，车间工人群众受到很大鼓舞。特别是一号炉工人更以“以天下为己任”的气概，把自己的炉子看成是钢铁战线上攻高硫、夺高产的尖兵，从各方面展开了顽强的斗争。他们团结得像一个人一样，见困难就上，抢着做最困难的工作。别的炉子的工人也把一号炉被确定为全国试验炉，看成是集体的荣誉。有一次，一号炉铁水快装满包了，四个工人手执泥枪，一个个依次冲上去堵塞出铁眼，但都没有堵住。在这紧急当儿，旁边二号炉工人立刻抓起自己备用的四根泥枪，冲过去帮忙，直到最后一根塞上去，才把出铁眼塞住，避免了“满包”事故。由于工人们齐心协力，一号炉很快就举起了红旗，为各地创造了很多好的经验，车间内其它炉子也猛追猛赶，跟了上来。
    车间党总支在领导这一用高硫生铁炼优质钢的斗争中，坚决支持工人群众突破技术关、采用新技术的心愿。他们采取的办法是：思想统一了就干，不统一就辩论，辩论不好就试验，试不好再研究、再试验，从而保证了各项新技术的贯彻执行。化铁炉由酸性改为碱性，是提高化铁炉去硫效率、打开转炉高产优质道路的一项极为重要的技术措施，工人要求迅速采用。但有少数干部决心不大，怕操作难掌握，有的提出生铁含硫高的时候改碱性，稍低的时候仍用酸性，也有人提出采用中性操作的折衷办法。党总支组织干部务虚，使大家进一步明确认识了改碱性炉的重大意义，取得了一致的认识。接着，干部就同工人们一起，首先在二号化铁炉上试验，去硫的效果很好。不久，就把全车间的化铁炉通统改成了碱性。化铁炉普遍改成碱性以后，需要采取“满风、足压”的新的操作技术，来提高炉子的熔化率。可是，进入炉子的风量增大以后，又出现了炉内脱料、搭棚、结铁等问题，影响正常生产。党总支又几次组织干部务虚，帮助他们用积极平衡的态度去对待新矛盾。干部同群众一起找到了问题的关键所在，炉前炉后工人都组织起来，全力保证化铁炉“吃饱吃好”，使“满风、足压”的新技术迅速得到推广，化铁炉的铁水熔化率也一步步提高。
    这个车间的主要领导干部，有的过去长期在部队和农村工作，有的是机械工人出身。他们虽然对转炉炼钢技术懂得不多，但坚信群众的力量，结果使复杂的技术问题得到解决。（附图片）
