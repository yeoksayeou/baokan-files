    The Cuban Literary and Art Cause Facing the Masses and Revolutionary Struggle
    With the development of the revolutionary struggle, Cuba's national literature and art cause serving the revolution and the broad masses is flourishing. Facing the masses and the revolutionary struggle has become a resounding slogan for Cuban artists.
    The famous Cuban poet Guillén said: "We can proudly announce that today in Cuba, revolutionary literature and art occupy the most important position. The main task of our artists is to dedicate their labor and talents to the revolutionary cause and promote the development of the revolution." Precisely in this way, Cuban artists have closely linked their careers with the reality of the revolutionary struggle. Not long ago, a reporter from the Cuban "Weekly Journal" visited many writers. The young poet Roble said that Cuba is in the process of revolution, and writers must contribute all their strength to the victory of the revolution. The famous writer Portuondo believes that "Only by profoundly expressing one's own, truly national things, instead of copying the fashionable and grotesque gadgets of Paris and New York, can one be recognized by the world. What is referred to here is the integration of the writer and the people. The writer must become one with the people, become a thorough Cuban—this is the writer's task for the revolution."
    It is with this vigorous passion that Cuban writers participate in the real struggle. Over the past year, in Cuba's "Hoy" newspaper, poems and articles by the poet Guillén can be seen every other day, and sometimes every day. He uses various forms to praise the victory of the revolution. At the same time, the poet's pen is like a dagger thrown at U.S. imperialism and reactionaries. His poems "No, Sir" and articles "A Useful Lesson," "After 137 Years," etc., sarcastically ridiculed the failure of U.S. imperialism in Cuba and incisively exposed the jackals' sinister conspiracies against Cuba.
    The revolutionary struggle has tempered the people's writers, and the writers have repaid their motherland and struggle with deep love and firm confidence. As the poet Quibehu wrote in his enthusiastic verses:
    Cuba, dear Cuba.
    If you see the night coming,
    Let it come,
    No matter what kind of night,
    With Castro and your people,
    You will surely break through it.
    If you see death coming,
    Let it come.
    No matter what kind of death,
    It must not harm
    Your heroic people.
    Currently, literary works depicting the revolutionary struggle are constantly being published in Cuba. The novel "Memoirs of the Sierra Maestra," which reflects the Cuban revolutionary struggle, is one of the favorite readings of the Cuban people. A large number of revolutionary songs have emerged in various places. These songs are mostly based on folk melodies, and they are widely circulating among the people. Some operas based on peasant singing forms, reflecting the joy of peasants in obtaining land and their determination to defend the revolution, are also being staged; murals with the themes of land reform, defending the revolution, and opposing intermediary exploitation have appeared on the walls of new rural residences and people's markets; the walls of major cities are plastered with posters by artists calling on young people to participate in revolutionary work. Dramas reflecting the reality of revolutionary life are welcomed everywhere. Not long ago, the drama "On the Sugarcane Plantation" with the theme of rural struggle and the script "Time is Blind" against racial discrimination were staged. The "El Sotano" theater is preparing to stage foreign scripts with a strong revolutionary spirit, such as Gorky's "Mother" and Leonov's "Invasion." In short, facing the reality of the revolutionary struggle has become an important feature of Cuban literary and art activities.
    Revolutionary artists regard serving the masses as their bounden duty. For example, some revolutionary musicians, dancers, and musical groups are currently performing for farmers in various places. On August 7, famous singers and guitar ensembles organized a grand people's carnival for farmers, and they used the money earned from the carnival as a revolutionary fund for purchasing weapons and airplanes. In Havana, people are renovating a former large theater. The Cuban government decided to make this theater a cultural building for the people. On the marble wall in front of the theater is written: "Peasant—this is your home. To be a free person, you must be a cultured person."
    Cuba's national film industry is also developing rapidly. After the victory of the revolution, the government established a film art and film specialty school. In addition to providing funding and equipment, the government also allocated three very good movie theaters confiscated from Batista's supporters for the school to use. After the first Cuban large-scale film "History of the Revolution" was born at the end of 1959, "Cuba in Dance" was also filmed. Documentary films such as "This Land of Ours," "A Year of Freedom," "Agricultural Cooperative," and "The Rebel Army" have been welcomed by audiences. This year, twelve documentaries, twelve animated films, and forty-eight popular science films mainly reflecting agricultural conditions will be completed. In addition, twelve widescreen color travel films will also be shot.
    Publishing houses are publishing a large number of "Books that people need when they struggle." The slogan "Establish a library for every family so that every Cuban can read" is encouraging publishers to work hard. For example, the Cuban National Publishing House has recently set itself the task of publishing 100,000 books per week.
    The revolutionary artists of Cuba are holding their destiny tightly and advancing in the revolutionary struggle of the people. They expressed this determination, as the writer José Soler said: "Literature and art should serve the interests of the people. If necessary, literary and art workers should drop their pens and pick up guns" to defend the heroic revolutionary cause.

### 面向大众和革命斗争的古巴文艺事业

    面向大众和革命斗争的古巴文艺事业	宇文
    随着革命斗争的发展，古巴为革命和广大群众服务的民族文学艺术事业正在蓬勃地发展，面向大众和革命斗争，已成为古巴艺术家们的响亮口号。
    著名的古巴诗人纪廉说：“我们可以自豪地宣布，今天在古巴，革命的文学艺术占了最重要的地位。我们艺术家的主要任务是把自己的劳动和才能献给革命事业，促使革命发展。”正是这样，古巴的文艺家们把自己事业和革命斗争的现实紧密地连系在一起。不久前，古巴“星期日报”的记者访问了不少文学家。年青的诗人罗伯说，古巴正处在革命的过程中，作家必须为革命的胜利贡献自己的全部力量。著名的文学家波尔杜昂多认为，“只有深刻表现自己的、真正民族的东西，而不是抄袭巴黎和纽约的时髦而怪诞的玩艺儿，才能得到世界的承认，这里所指的是，作家和人民熔为一体的东西，作家必须成为人民的骨肉，成为一个彻底的古巴人——这就是作家对革命的任务。”
    古巴的文学家们正是怀着这种旺盛的激情参加了现实的斗争。一年来，在古巴的“今日报”上，每隔一两天，甚至有时天天都可以看到诗人纪廉的诗歌和文章，他利用多种的形式讴歌革命的胜利，同时，诗人的笔锋又像匕首一样地投向了美帝国主义和反动派。他的诗作“不，先生”和文章“一个有益的教训”、“137年之后”等，都辛辣地嘲笑了美帝在古巴的失败和一针见血地道破了豺狼们对古巴的险恶阴谋。
    革命斗争锻炼了人民的作家，作家又对自己的祖国和斗争报以深刻的热爱和坚定的信心。正如诗人基贝呼在他热情洋溢的诗行中写道：
    古巴，亲爱的古巴。
    如果你看到黑夜将临，
    就让它来吧，
    无论是怎样的黑夜，
    有了卡斯特罗和你的人民，
    你一定能把它冲破。
    如果你看到死亡将临，
    就让它来吧。
    无论是怎样的死亡，
    它决不能伤害
    你的英勇的人民。
    目前，在古巴描写革命斗争的文学作品不断出版，反映古巴革命斗争的小说“马埃斯特腊山的回忆录”，是古巴人民喜爱的读物之一。各地涌现了大批的革命歌曲，这些歌曲多是以民间旋律为基础的，它们正广泛地流传在人民中间，一些以农民歌唱形式为基础的、反映农民获得土地的欢乐和保卫革命决心的歌剧也在上演；在农村新住宅和人民市场的墙壁上，出现了以土地改革、保卫革命和反对中间人剥削为主题的壁画；各大城市的墙壁上贴满了美术家们号召青年参加革命工作的宣传画。反映革命现实生活的戏剧到处受到欢迎，不久前上演了以农村斗争为主题的话剧“在甘蔗种植场上”和反对种族歧视的剧本“时间是盲目的”。“埃尔·索塔诺”剧院正在准备上演具有强烈革命精神的外国剧本，如高尔基的“母亲”和列昂诺夫的“侵略”等。总之，面向革命斗争的现实已成了古巴文艺界活动的重要特征。
    革命文艺家们把为大众服务看为自己的应尽义务，例如，目前一些革命的音乐家、舞蹈家和音乐团体正在各地为农民演出。8月7日，著名的歌唱家和六弦琴演奏团为农民组织了盛大的人民联欢会，而且，他们把联欢会所收入的钱用作购买武器和飞机的革命基金。在哈瓦那，人们正在装修从前的一座大剧院，古巴政府决定使这个剧院成为人民的文化大厦，在剧院门前的大理石墙上写着：“农民——这是你的家。要做一个自由的人，就得做一个有文化的人。”
    古巴的民族电影事业也在迅速发展，革命胜利后，政府成立了电影艺术与电影专科学校，除了供给经费和设备外，政府还把从巴蒂斯塔的拥护者手里没收的三个很好的电影院拨给这所学校使用。1959年年底诞生了第一部古巴大型影片“革命的历史”后，接着又拍摄了“古巴在舞蹈”。纪录影片“我们的这块土地”、“自由的一年”、“农业合作社”、“起义军”等受到了观众的欢迎。今年将完成十二部纪录片、十二部动画片和四十八部主要反映农业情况的科学普及片。此外，还要拍十二部宽银幕彩色旅行片。
    出版社正在大量出版“当人们斗争时，他们所需要的书”。“为一切家庭设立图书馆，使得每一个古巴人能够读书”的口号，正在鼓励着出版工作者们紧张的工作，如古巴国家出版社最近已为自己提出了每周出书十万册的任务。
    古巴革命的文艺家们正在紧握着自己的命运，在人民大众的革命斗争中前进。他们表示了这样的决心，正如作家何塞·索莱尔所说的那样：“文艺应该为人民利益服务，如果需要，文艺工作者们就应丢下笔杆拿起枪杆”去捍卫英雄的革命事业。
