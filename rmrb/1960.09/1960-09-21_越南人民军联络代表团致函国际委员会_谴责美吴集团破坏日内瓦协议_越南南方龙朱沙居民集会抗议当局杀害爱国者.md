    Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, September 19th: According to a Vietnam News Agency report on the 18th, the Liaison Delegation of the General Command of the Vietnam People's Army recently wrote nineteen letters to the International Commission, condemning the crimes of the U.S.-Ngo Dinh Diem clique in repeatedly sabotaging the Geneva Accords.
    The delegation revealed in the letters that from May 11th to May 25th, twelve U.S. military aircraft transported one hundred and two U.S. military personnel to South Vietnam, including officers, non-commissioned officers, and soldiers.
    The delegation also revealed that during the same period, several thousand tons of war materials were transported to South Vietnam by thirteen U.S. and foreign ships. Among these ships were three tank landing ships.
    The delegation further revealed that from July 12th to 22nd, 25 batches totaling two hundred and forty-seven Ngo Dinh Diem agents illegally intruded into the southern part of the demilitarized zone. In the letters of protest, the delegation requested the International Commission to take effective measures to ensure the strict implementation of the Geneva Accords by the South Vietnamese authorities.

    Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, September 19th: According to Vietnam News Agency reports: More than two thousand residents who were re-grouped in the Long Xuyen and Chau Doc area (referring to the three provinces of Long Xuyen, Chau Doc, and Sa Dec) according to the Geneva Accords held a rally on the 18th to protest the recently revealed atrocities of Ngo Dinh Diem authorities' agents in the area, who murdered nearly one hundred patriots.
    As stated in the recent statement of the people of Sa Dec to the International Commission, Ngo Dinh Diem's agents in this province, acting under the "secret orders" of Ngo Dinh Diem's "Ministry of Interior," assassinated more than fifty patriots imprisoned in the local Hoc Lan prison in June of this year. Earlier, about twenty people were murdered in the Long Xuyen and Chau Doc area. The bodies of the dead were found in the Mekong River and the Sa Dec River.
    The participants at the conference unanimously passed a petition requesting the International Commission to immediately conduct an on-site investigation of these massacres and demanding that the Ngo Dinh Diem authorities provide compensation to the families of the deceased.
    The petition also requested that the Ngo Dinh Diem authorities publish the names of the dead and release those patriots who are still imprisoned.
