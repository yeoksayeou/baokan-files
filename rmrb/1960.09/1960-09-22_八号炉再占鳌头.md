　　No. 8 Furnace Takes the Lead Again
    In early September, a news item was published in the newspaper: "Tianjin Refractory Material Factory's No. 4 Calcination Furnace Comes from Behind," saying that the workers on this furnace admitted their backwardness, were unwilling to lag behind, humbly learned, and worked hard, surpassing the advanced collective of the same workshop—No. 8 Calcination Furnace—which had attended the National Conference of Heroes.
    Upon seeing the newspaper, the workers of No. 8 Furnace congratulated No. 4 Furnace and resolved to catch up quickly and maintain the honor of the "Old Hero Furnace." They examined their work and formulated a specific plan to learn from and catch up with No. 4 Furnace. From the furnace chief to the workers, everyone went to No. 4 Furnace to find learning targets and learn from No. 4 Furnace in all aspects. The workers of No. 4 Furnace also enthusiastically shared their experiences with them.
    In August, No. 4 Furnace surpassed No. 8 Furnace with an average daily output of 19.1 tons of dolomite material and a hearth utilization coefficient of 2.16; since mid-September, No. 8 Furnace has surpassed No. 4 Furnace again with an average daily output of 21.5 tons and a utilization coefficient of 2.43. No. 4 Furnace has also improved compared to August, with an average daily output reaching 19.5 tons and the utilization coefficient rising to 2.2. The rate of qualified products of both furnaces is above 95%, and consumption has also been reduced.

　　八号炉再占鳌头
    9月初，报上登过一条“天津耐火器材厂四号煅烧炉后来居上”的消息，说的是：这座炉上的职工承认落后，不甘落后，虚心学习，埋头苦干，赶过本车间曾出席全国群英会的先进集体——八号煅烧炉。
    八号炉职工看到报纸，一面向四号炉道喜，一面下定决心快步赶上去，保住“老英雄炉”的荣誉。他们检查了自己的工作，订了学赶四号炉的具体规划。从炉长到工人，人人都到四号炉找学赶对象，全面向四号炉学习。四号炉职工也热情地同他们交流经验。
    8月份，四号炉曾以平均日产十九点一吨白云石料、炉底利用系数二点一六的成绩赶过八号炉；9月中旬以来，八号炉又以平均日产二十一点五吨、利用系数二点四三的水平，赶过了四号炉。四号炉也比8月份更上一层楼，平均日产量达到十九点五吨，利用系数上升到二点二。两个炉的正品率都在95％以上，消耗也都降低了。
