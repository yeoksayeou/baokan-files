    **Hand in Hand**

    From the beginning of this year, a surge of jointly advancing and completing the Seven-Year Plan earlier swept across vast areas of the Soviet Union. The characteristic of this competition is that it has broken through the limitations of a single region or factory. The areas participating in the competition have become wider, and the content of mutual assistance and collaboration in the competition is richer. Moscow versus Leningrad, Sverdlovsk versus Dnepropetrovsk, Kharkov versus Novosibirsk, Tatar versus Kuibyshev, Belarus versus Stalingrad, Tashkent versus Ivanovo, Azerbaijan versus Bashkir, Karaganda versus Lugansk – thus, a competition began between city and city, economic zone and economic zone, republic and republic.

    The competition between Moscow and Leningrad is relatively detailed and in-depth. These two major industrial centers of the Soviet Union proposed in January of this year to complete not only the Seven-Year Plan for labor productivity but also the Seven-Year Plan for products two years ahead of schedule. The two major cities decided to fully cooperate, learn from each other's strengths, make up for each other's weaknesses, exchange experiences in a timely manner, and fully support each other. After the competition between the two cities was proposed, dozens of districts between the two cities and hundreds of factories launched competitions and cooperation between districts, factory to factory, workshop to workshop, work team to work team, and worker to worker. In the competition, the Leningrad District of Moscow and the Moscow District of Leningrad decided to use the method of cooperation with each other to complete this year's technical innovation plan ahead of schedule. The Moscow District of Leningrad will establish more than 40 automatic production lines this year, and the Leningrad District of Moscow will establish 26 automatic lines and innovate 600 lathes. More than 140 factories, as well as scientific institutions and universities in these two districts, have been mobilized to work together to achieve this task.

    Factories participating in the labor emulation are also factories that establish cooperation and friendship. After the Moscow Cable Factory and the Leningrad Northern Cable Factory drew up a competition plan, the exchange of experience became more frequent. Tunov, director of the winding workshop of the Northern Cable Factory, and Zlatkin, a mechanical worker, created a new drying method for glass-clad cables. They immediately notified the Moscow Cable Factory, which immediately sent a delegation to learn from the experience and brought back the drawings to adopt in their own work. When the Moscow Cable Factory successfully trial-produced highly insulated wires for high-voltage motors, the Northern Cable Factory also came to learn from the experience, and the two factories began production at the same time.

    After the Moscow Gasifier Factory and the Leningrad Gasifier Factory launched a competition, the workshops and work teams of the two factories cooperated and supported each other. The manpower and equipment of the two factories are complementary to each other. The Moscow factory proposed that whatever the Leningrad factory needs, it will do its best to supply. The two factories will use their joint efforts to strive to complete the Seven-Year Plan in a shorter time than five years.

    This kind of action in which two regions join hands to move forward has powerfully promoted the development of production and the early completion of the Seven-Year Plan. The two economic zones of Leningrad and Moscow conduct monthly competition summaries, and since April, they have achieved the goal of having no enterprises that fail to complete the plan. Like the Lugansk Economic Zone and the Stalinino Economic Zone, there are fewer and fewer backward enterprises, and a new atmosphere of common high tide has emerged.

    **Mutual Assistance**

    With the deepening of the Gaganova movement, many places in the Soviet Union, in industry, agriculture, and other departments, have seen the initiative of one enterprise collective helping another. This initiative, like Gaganova's initiative, is also full of the spirit of not caring about gains and losses, assisting others, and taking responsibility for the progress of brotherly collectives.

    This initiative was first proposed in the Stalingrad Tractor Factory. This factory is an enterprise with a high level of production and strong technical strength, but the "Gas Equipment" factory not far from it is a new and backward enterprise. The Tractor Factory decided to help the factory carry out reconstruction, supply technical data, design new technological processes, supply equipment, and supply cadres. One of the guarantees of the Tractor Factory this year is to help the "Gas Equipment" factory become an advanced factory this year. The Tractor Factory helped the "Gas Equipment" factory formulate a new reconstruction plan, which can reduce the reconstruction cost by more than two-thirds and enable the "Gas Equipment" factory to reach the original production level of 1965 within this year.

    The Perm Oblast Dzerzhinsky Machine Building Factory is another example. This factory took the initiative to enthusiastically help a small factory nearby to formulate an automation and mechanization plan, and sent skilled workers and engineering personnel to help implement this plan. Under the meticulous and thoughtful care of the entire collective, this small factory has embarked on the road of automation and mechanization, and production has rapidly changed.

    Such examples of collective help to collective are no longer isolated. The Kubawein Fine Flannel Factory in Moscow Oblast voluntarily helped the nearby Troitsk Fine Flannel Factory to reach the level of an advanced enterprise. The former helped the latter discover many production potentials, helped the latter learn new methods of processing thick woolen fabrics, and helped organize workers' spare-time learning. The "Three Mountains" Textile Factory in Moscow, and textile factories in seven cities including Tashkent and Ivanovo, decided that several collectives should help each other to improve production and labor productivity.

    Advanced collective farms have also decided to provide collective assistance to neighboring backward collective farms. For example, the "Kuban" Collective Farm in Krasnodar Krai decided to help the neighboring "Zhdanov" Collective Farm. Last year, the total income of the "Kuban" farm was more than 19 million rubles, while the "Zhdanov" farm only earned more than 9 million rubles, although the natural conditions of the two farms are the same. The "Kuban" farm first helped the "Zhdanov" farm to clarify the reasons for the backwardness, find ways to improve crop yields and increase livestock income, and sent its own agronomists to work, and made a detailed plan for the latter to increase income this year. This year, the Zhdanov Collective Farm plans to first increase the yield of corn and sugar beets with the full assistance of the advanced collective farm, and gradually catch up with the level of the advanced collective farm in an all-round way.

    **Vigorous Support**

    The enthusiasm of the Soviet people to help each other is also manifested in their support for agriculture. Now, Soviet cities and factories are vigorously helping the rural areas in terms of production and life.

    The working people of Moscow decided to provide collective assistance to Akmola Oblast in Kazakhstan. Fourteen districts of Moscow decided to help fourteen districts of Akmola, one fixed help for one. Khmelnitsky Oblast of Ukraine also decided to fully assist Kazakhstan in this year's harvest work and has prepared a large number of mechanical hands and specifically allocated areas, which can be immediately dispatched in the future. All oblasts of Ukraine are undertaking the responsibility of helping Kazakhstan harvest, because this is a major issue in the development of agriculture in Kazakhstan.

    All walks of life are undertaking specific tasks to support agriculture. The steel industry proposed to establish an extra-plan steel reserve for agriculture. The Magnitogorsk Iron and Steel Combine decided to produce 120,000 tons of steel reserves for agriculture above the plan this year. The Nizhny Tagil Iron and Steel Plant decided to produce 60,000 tons more. The same is true of the machinery manufacturing industry. The Moscow Dynamo Factory will produce 3,000 more motors this year to supply the rural areas. The Stalingrad Tractor Factory will produce 3,000 more tractors this year to help the rural areas fully mechanize. Such examples have emerged in large numbers throughout the Soviet Union.

    The Moscow "Sickle and Hammer" Factory not only regularly and fixedly helps the Gorky Collective Farm in Moscow Oblast, but also recently launched a competition with the farm. The Koleev rolling steel work team of the factory proposed to compete with the mechanical hands of the farm. The competition conditions for the rolling steel workers are to complete the task one hour ahead of schedule in each work shift, produce more rolled steel to supply the rural areas, each worker should learn a second skill, help the rural mechanical hands repair machines, and improve technical level. The competition conditions proposed by the farm's mechanical hands are to complete the spring plowing at the fastest speed and complete the mechanization of the livestock farm.

    Cultural and artistic workers and commercial workers are also specifically supporting the rural areas. Art and drama workers have helped rural areas establish many satellite theaters, choirs, symphony orchestras, and museums. The Moscow Art Theater and the rural theater in Orekhovo-Zuyevo District have established regular contact and specifically help this theater carry out rural activities. Intellectuals in the Saksoev District of Ryazan Oblast initiated a proposal to help all young people in the district receive eight years of education, and also help at least 1,000 collective farmers learn to drive tractors and cars and master new agricultural production technologies. Many regions are helping farms establish cultural universities, clubs, sports fields, and open public canteens and life service organizations.

    **From Team to Factory**

    The Soviet Communist Labor Team movement, which began at the end of the previous year and was born simultaneously with the Seven-Year Plan, has been going on for more than a year. From this year on, it has begun to move from the team to the enterprise, and put forward the competition slogan of striving for the entire enterprise to become a Communist Labor Enterprise.

    The Moscow "Three Mountains" Textile Factory, Hard Alloy Factory, and Ilyich Factory were the first to propose to make their factories Communist Labor Factories. The "Three Mountains" Textile Factory is determined to achieve the equipment utilization rate target of the last year of the Seven-Year Plan ahead of schedule this year. The Seven-Year Plan's target for improving labor productivity will also be achieved earlier this year. This year, the vast majority of employees will study in higher and secondary spare-time specialized schools or in spare-time political schools. The factory also put forward many specific suggestions to cultivate the moral character and collectivist spirit of all personnel.

    This competition has been responded to. Some factories and enterprises have been awarded the title of Communist Labor Factory due to their outstanding achievements over the past year. For example, the Khabarovsk Oil Extraction Factory has a total of four work teams. Last year, three work teams won the victory in the Communist Labor Team competition, and this year the fourth work team has won the victory again. All four teams have won the title of Communist Labor Team. As a result, this factory has won the honor of Communist Labor Factory. The Baku October Revolution Vehicle Repair Factory has won victories in 20 consecutive socialist competitions. The factory has made every worker overfulfill the quota, and the factory's collectivism and spirit of cooperation have been greatly promoted. Based on these achievements, the Azerbaijan Trade Union Congress held in Baku in May decided to award the factory the title of Communist Labor Factory.

    劳动竞赛的热潮
    本报记者　李楠
    携手并进
    今年一开始，苏联广大地区卷起一股共同前进，更早地完成七年计划的热潮。这一竞赛的特点是突破了一个地区、一个工厂的限制，参加竞赛的地区广泛了，竞赛中的相互帮助和协作的内容更丰富了。莫斯科对列宁格勒、斯维德洛夫斯克对第聂泊尔彼得罗夫斯克、哈尔科夫对新西伯利亚、鞑鞑尔对古比雪夫、白俄罗斯对斯大林格勒、塔什干对伊凡诺夫、阿塞拜疆对巴什基尔、卡拉干达对卢干斯克，这样一个城市和一个城市，一个经济区和一个经济区，一个共和国和一个共和国之间的竞赛开始了。
    莫斯科市和列宁格勒市的竞赛比较细致和深入。这两个苏联的大工业中心今年1月份就提出要提前两年不仅完成劳动生产率的七年计划，而且还要完成产品的七年计划。两个大城市决定全力合作，彼此取长补短，及时交流经验，互相充分支援。两市的竞赛提出之后，两个城市的几十个区之间，几百家工厂之间就展开了区对区，工厂对工厂，车间对车间，工作队对工作队，工人对工人的竞赛和合作。莫斯科的列宁格勒区和列宁格勒的莫斯科区在竞赛中决定今年要利用彼此开展协作的方法提前完成今年的技术革新计划。列宁格勒的莫斯科区今年要建立四十多条自动工作线，莫斯科的列宁格勒区要建立二十六条自动线和革新六百部车床。这两区的一百四十多座工厂，以及科学机关和高等学校已经动员起来，为实现这个任务而共同奋斗。
    参加劳动竞赛的工厂也就是建立协作和友谊的工厂。莫斯科电缆工厂和列宁格勒北方电缆工厂订立了竞赛的计划后，交流经验的来往更加频繁了。北方电缆工厂绕线车间主任图诺夫和机械工人兹拉特金创造了玻璃丝包电缆的新烘干方法，他们立刻就通知莫斯科电缆厂，而后者就立刻派出代表团前来学习经验，把图样带了回来，在自己工作中采用。莫斯科电缆厂试制成功了有高度绝缘性的供高压电动机用的电线时，北方电缆厂也来学习经验，两个工厂同时开始生产。
    莫斯科气化器工厂和列宁格勒气化器工厂开展了竞赛后，两个厂车间与车间、工作队与工作队都互相合作，互相支援。两个厂的人力和设备都相互补充。莫斯科工厂提出凡是列宁格勒工厂需要的，一定尽力供给。两个厂用共同的力量争取以比五年更短的时间完成七年计划。
    这种两个地区携手共同前进的行动有力地促进了生产的发展和提前完成七年计划。列宁格勒和莫斯科两经济区每月都进行竞赛总结，4月份起已经做到了没有完不成计划的企业。像卢干斯克经济区斯大林诺经济区已做到落后企业越来越少，出现了彼此共同高涨的新气象。
    相互帮助
    随着加干诺娃运动的深入，苏联许多地方工业、农业中以及其他部门，都出现了一个企业集体帮助另一个企业的创议。这一创议像加干诺娃的创议一样，同样充满了不计得失，协助旁人，为兄弟集体的进步负起责任的精神。
    这个创议首先在斯大林格勒拖拉机工厂提出。这个厂是个生产水平高、技术力量强的企业，但离它不远的“煤气设备”工厂却是一个新的后进企业。拖拉机工厂决定帮助这个工厂进行改建，供应技术资料，设计新的工艺过程，供应设备，供给干部。拖拉机工厂今年的保证中就有一项，要帮助“煤气设备”工厂在今年内成为先进工厂。拖拉机工厂帮助“煤气设备”工厂制订了新改建方案，可以使改建费用减少三分之二以上，并且使“煤气设备”工厂在今年内就可以达到原订的1965年的生产水平。
    白尔姆州捷尔任斯基机器制造厂是另外一个例证。这个工厂主动热情帮助附近的一家小厂制订自动化和机械化计划，而且派熟练工人和工程人员去帮助实现这一计划。在整个集体的细致周到的关怀下，这家小工厂已走上自动化和机械化的道路，生产迅速改观了。
    这种集体帮助集体的事例现在已经不是个别的。莫斯科州库巴维因细绒工厂自愿帮助附近的特罗特伊斯克细绒工厂达到先进企业的水平。前者帮助后者发掘出许多生产潜力，帮助后者学会了新的加工厚呢绒的方法，同时帮助组织职工的业余学习。莫斯科“三山”纺织厂、塔什干、伊凡诺夫等七个城市的纺织厂更决定几个集体互相帮助，提高生产，提高劳动生产率。
    先进的农庄也决定对相邻的落后农庄进行集体帮助。例如克拉斯诺达边疆区“古班”集体农庄决定帮助相邻的“日丹诺夫”集体农庄。去年“古班”农庄总收入一千九百多万卢布，
  “日丹诺夫”农庄只收入九百多万卢布，虽然两个农庄的自然条件是一样的。“古班”农庄首先帮助“日丹诺夫”农庄弄清了落后的原因，找出提高农作物收成，增加饲畜业收入的途径，并派了自己的农学家去工作，为后者作出了今年提高收入的详细计划。日丹诺夫农庄今年计划在先进农庄的全力帮助下，首先做到玉米和甜菜提高产量，逐步全面赶上先进农庄的水平。
    大力支援
    苏联人民的彼此进行帮助的热情也表现在对农业的支援上面。现在，苏联的城市和工厂企业都在对农村生产方面和生活方面进行大力帮助。
    莫斯科市劳动人民决定对哈萨克的阿克摩林斯克州进行集体帮助。莫斯科十四个区决定帮助阿克摩林斯克的十四个区，一个固定帮助一个。乌克兰赫米里尼茨基州也决定全力帮助哈萨克斯坦进行今年的收获工作，并且已准备好了大批的机械手，具体分配了地区，将来可以立即动身前往。乌克兰各个州都负担起帮助哈萨克斯坦收获的责任，因为这是哈萨克斯坦发展农业中的一个重大问题。
    各行各业都在为支援农业负担起具体的任务。钢铁业提出要为农业建立超计划的钢铁储备。马格尼托哥尔斯克钢铁联合工厂决定要在今年为农业超计划生产十二万吨钢铁储备。下塔吉尔钢铁厂决定要多生产六万吨。机械制造业也是这样。莫斯科吉纳摩工厂今年要多生产三千部电动机供给农村。斯大林格勒拖拉机工厂今年要多生产三千部拖拉机帮助农村全面机械化。这种事例已经在全苏各地大量涌现。
    莫斯科“镰刀与锤子”工厂不仅经常固定地帮助莫斯科州的高尔基农庄，最近还和农庄展开了竞赛。工厂的科列也夫轧钢工作班提出和农庄的机械手彼此竞赛。轧钢工人的竞赛条件是每个工作轮班都提前一小时完成任务，生产更多的轧钢供应农村，每个工人都学会第二种技能，帮助农村机械手修理机器，提高技术水平。农庄机械手提出的竞赛条件是以最快的速度完成春耕，完成畜牧场的机械化工作。
    文化艺术工作者和商业工作者也都在具体地支援农村。艺术戏剧工作者帮助农村建立了许多卫星剧院，合唱团，交响乐队，博物馆。莫斯科艺术剧院和奥列霍沃—祖耶沃区的农村剧院建立了经常联系，具体帮助这个剧院开展农村活动。梁赞州萨克索耶夫区的知识分子发起倡议，要帮助本区所有青年人接受八年制教育，还要帮助至少一千名集体农民学会驾驶拖拉机和汽车，并掌握农业生产新技术。许多地区都在帮助农庄建立文化大学、俱乐部、运动场，开办公共食堂、生活服务机构。
    从队到厂
    从前年底开始的和七年计划同时诞生的苏联共产主义劳动队运动已经经过一年多的时间，从今年起已开始从队到企业，提出了争取全企业成为共产主义劳动企业的竞赛口号。
    莫斯科“三山”纺织厂、硬质合金工厂、伊里奇工厂首先提出来要使自己的工厂成为共产主义劳动工厂。“三山”纺织厂决心今年就要提前实现七年计划最后一年的设备利用率的指标。七年计划的提高劳动生产率指标也要在今年提早实现。今年要做到绝大部分职工都进高等和中等业余专科学校或者到业余政治学校学习。工厂还提出了许多具体的建议，培养全体人员的道德品质和集体主义精神。
    这一竞赛得到了响应。一些工厂企业单位由于一年多来的优异成绩已获得共产主义劳动工厂的称号。例如哈巴诺夫斯克榨油工厂共有四个工作队，去年已有三个工作队在共产主义劳动队竞赛中获得胜利，今年第四个工作队又在竞赛中获得胜利。四个队都获得共产主义劳动队的称号。这样结果这家工厂就获得了共产主义劳动工厂的荣誉。巴库十月革命车辆修理厂因为在连续二十次的社会主义竞赛中都获得了胜利，工厂做到了每个工人都超额完成定额，并且工厂的集体主义和协作精神已大大发扬。根据这些成就，5月份在巴库举行的阿塞拜疆职工会代表大会上决定授予这家工厂以共产主义劳动工厂的称号。
