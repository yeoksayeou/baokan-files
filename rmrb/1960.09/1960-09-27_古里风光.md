　　Scenery of Guli

　　Sun Zhen

　　The golden Dongting Lake and the refreshing autumn breeze, Guli dresses up to greet the autumn sun (note), with vibrant colors like brocade, adding more beauty to the Jiangnan region. The highway stretches far through the area, with rows of sunflowers and poplars, the new sunflowers stand tall, dancing with golden halos, competing with the willows in new attire. Melons and beans stretch along the roadside, tender vegetables covering the slopes. Green dragon bean vines on the field banks, gently pushing the rice sea in vast waves. Corn stalks lined up in rows, sorghum swaying, and rice fragrant. Clear river water with flying oars, fully loaded with melons and vegetables for a long voyage. Villages hidden in the green trees, colorful like gardens. Purple hyacinth bean flowers dancing with butterflies, colorful arches everywhere, filling the courtyard with fragrance. Loofah flowers blooming all over, clusters of flowers decorating the new village. Dense loofah vines carving a painted gallery, bean vines dyeing the pink walls green. The golden Dongting Lake and the refreshing autumn breeze, Guli dresses up to greet the autumn sun. No need for "Wisteria" or "Virginia creeper," melon and bean vines reflecting the rosy clouds. Collective wisdom shines brightly, the commune's miracle is magnificent. (Note) Guli Commune, Changshu County, Jiangsu Province, utilizes roadsides, embankments, field edges, enclosure edges, ditch edges, and around houses to plant various crops, totaling more than one hundred varieties. This commune is a high-yield rice area in Jiangnan. To achieve even higher yields in high-yield areas and more surplus grain in surplus grain areas, they have utilized over 7,800 mu of available space.

　　古里风光
　　孙振洞庭金黄秋风爽，古里盛装迎秋阳（注），万紫千红似锦绣，江南又添风光。公路穿境一望远，一行葵花一行杨，新葵婷立舞金环，竞与杨柳比新装。瓜豆连绵镶路边，菜嫩铺满坡旁。青龙豆蔓田岸上，轻推稻海万顷浪。玉米株株列成行，高粱摆动稻飘香。清清河水飞双桨，满载瓜菜远航。绿树丛中隐村庄，五彩缤纷像花园。紫色扁豆花舞蝶，处处彩门满庭芳。丝瓜花开遍地星，花团锦簇饰新乡。瓜藤密茂雕画廊，豆蔓染绿粉墙。洞庭金黄秋风爽，古里盛装迎秋阳。无需“紫藤”“爬山虎”，瓜藤豆蔓映霞光。集体智慧闪光辉，公社奇迹辉煌。（注）江苏常熟县古里公社利用路边、堤边、田边、圩边、沟边以及家前屋后种植各种作物，共一百多种。这个公社是江南水稻高产区，为了高产地区更高产，余粮地区多余粮，他们共利用隙地面积达七千八百多亩。
