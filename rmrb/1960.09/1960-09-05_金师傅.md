   Master Jin

    Master Jin woke up for the third time, the sky barely light. His wife said angrily, "It's Sunday, why aren't you sleeping well and just tossing and turning?"
    "I have something important to do, I'm afraid I'll be late."
    His wife sat up abruptly and asked, "What is it?"
    Master Jin whispered in her ear, "Going to support agriculture. You must keep it a secret, okay!"
    Support agriculture also needs to be kept a secret? This is what happened:
    Yesterday, after he got off work, he saw a crowd of people gathered next to the canteen. He squeezed in to take a look, and it turned out the notice said that they would be going to the countryside for voluntary labor tomorrow, and those who were willing should sign up with the Party branch.
    Master Jin didn't even eat his meal and ran over. Good heavens, the people signing up were already in a line. When it was his turn to sign up, Secretary Zhou wouldn't write his name down. He said, "Don't bother going, you're over fifty, I don't think your body can take it."
    "Who says I can't take it?" Master Jin patted his chest. "Anyone who doesn't believe me can try me!"
    "There are a lot of people signing up, let the young people go," Secretary Zhou explained, "You take a day off!"
    Master Jin saw that he was only focused on writing down names for others and ignoring him. He thought: year after year, what we eat and wear all depends on agriculture, and now Chairman Mao is calling on us to support agriculture, but I… He suddenly had an idea: "That's right! I'll go by myself." - This was his secret.
    After his wife heard him, she quickly jumped out of bed to make him food. Master Jin took out his axe, saw, plane, chisel and other carpentry tools. These had all been put down since the great technical revolution. Now, he wanted to let them show their power again.
    On the road leading to the suburbs, everywhere were armies of people supporting agriculture. Voices rang with excitement, and red flags fluttered in the wind. Master Jin carried his tools on his back, walking in the flow of people. He looked back and thought: Oh no! Secretary Zhou is leading the troops and catching up! He quickened his pace and hurriedly slipped into a nearby village.
    He entered the village and was just bending over when he suddenly heard the sound of carpentry tools. He followed the sound and found that several commune members were rushing to make weeding machines. He thought to himself, "I've come to the right place!" He happily picked up his tools and started working.
    The commune members saw that this old man had suddenly arrived, and that his work was both fast and good, so they asked, "Master, what's your name? Where are you from?"
    Master Jin raised his head, smiled, didn't say a word, and buried himself in his work again.
    Master Jin was sweating profusely as he worked when he suddenly heard Secretary Zhou's voice outside. He thought to himself, "Please don't come in!"
    It turned out that Secretary Zhou was coordinating with the commune's production team leader in the field, asking if the team had any repair work, and the team leader, saying that they were in a hurry to manufacture weeding machines, led him over to take a look.
    Secretary Zhou was stunned when he saw Master Jin: "You…?"
    "I…" Master Jin's heart was pounding, and he quickly replied, "I can't stand being idle at home!"
    "You, you, you're really made of iron!"

   金师傅

    金师傅第三次醒来，天才蒙蒙亮。老伴生气地说：“星期天，你不好好睡，折腾啥呀？”
    “有要紧事，我怕误了时间。”
    老伴一骨碌坐起来问：“啥事？”
    金师傅咬着她的耳朵：“去支援农业。你可得保守秘密噢！”
    支援农业也要保守秘密？原来是这么回事：
    昨天，他下了班见食堂旁边围着一堆人。他挤进去一看，原来通知上写着明天去农村义务劳动，愿意去的，到党支部报名。
    金师傅饭也没吃，就跑去了。好家伙，报名的都排上队了。挨着他报名，周书记不给写。说：“你甭去啦，年过半百了，看身子骨顶不住。”
    “谁说我顶不住？”金师傅把胸脯一拍：“谁不服，就比比看！”
    “报名的人很多，让年轻人去，”周书记解释着，“你歇息一天吧！”
    金师傅见他只顾给别人写名，不理自己，他想：成年累月，吃的穿的都靠农业，现在毛主席号召支援农业，可自己……他忽然脑门一亮：“对！我单个去。”——这就是他的秘密。
    老伴听他说了，忙跳下床给他做饭。金师傅拿出了斧、锯、刨、凿等木匠家伙。这些，从大闹技术革命起都放下了。现在，他要让它们去再显威力。
    通往郊区的公路上，到处是支援农业的大军。人声欢腾，红旗招展。金师傅背着家伙，走在人流里。他回头一看：糟糕！周书记领着人马赶上来了！他放快脚步，紧忙溜进了附近的村庄。
    他进了村，正在转腰子，忽听有木匠家伙响。他顺着声音找去，原来有几个社员正在赶制锄草机。他心里说：“可找对了！”他高兴地抄起家伙，就干起来。
    社员们见冷不丁来了这么个老头，活路又快又好，就问：“老师傅，您贵姓？从哪来？”
    金师傅抬起头来，笑一笑，二话没说，又埋头干起来。
    金师傅正汗流浃背地干活，忽听外边有周书记的说话声。他心里说；“可千万别进来！”
    原来周书记在田间和公社的生产队长挂钩，问社里有什么修理活，队长说急着制造锄草机便领他来看。
    周书记看见金师傅一楞：“你……？”
    “我……”金师傅心里嘣嘣跳，连忙回答：“我在家闲不住呵！”
    “你呀，你呀，你真是块铁！”
