Xinhua News Agency, September 28th: Xinhua News Agency reporter reports: Today, hundreds of thousands of people in the capital, with immense enthusiasm, formed a friendship corridor stretching tens of li in the drizzling autumn rain, warmly and solemnly welcoming Prime Minister U Nu and General Ne Win, along with all three hundred-plus Burmese guests of honor. The emotions of the people of the capital express the friendly feelings of all the Chinese people towards our kin country. With the historically significant Sino-Burmese Border Treaty about to be signed, this friendship between the two peoples reached a new peak today.

　　In the heavy rain, Premier Zhou Enlai, accompanied by Prime Minister U Nu and General Ne Win, slowly advanced in an open-top car. The clothes of the welcoming masses and all the guests of honor were almost completely drenched by the rain. But people forgot all about it. Young women threw handfuls of flower petals onto the guests' cars, and welcoming slogans and the sound of gongs and drums resounded over the capital. People smiled excitedly and said that when Premier Zhou Enlai visited Burma this year, he celebrated the Burmese Water Festival with the Burmese people. Today, Prime Minister U Nu and General Ne Win have also come to China to celebrate the "Water Festival."

　　The Burmese Federal Government's dispatch of such an unprecedentedly large delegation to China for a friendly visit has deeply moved the Chinese people. The enthusiasm shown by the people of Beijing today in welcoming the guests of honor in the rain has also deeply moved the Burmese guests. Throughout the wide street spanning tens of li in the center of the city, the welcoming masses were packed shoulder to shoulder. Under the bright lights, they continuously waved flags and shouted slogans at the huge convoy of hundreds of guest vehicles that came one after another, fully expressing their sincere friendship towards the guests from their kin country.

　　"I live at the head of the river, you live at the tail of the river, our affection for each other is boundless, we drink from the same river. … We are relatives, our languages are mostly the same, we unite and help each other, our peaceful strength is great." These are the verses from Vice Premier Chen Yi's poem "To Burmese Friends" written at the end of 1957. Today, the kin-like "Pauk-Phaw" friendship between the two peoples has achieved new development. In the welcoming crowd that stretched as far as the eye could see, young people, women, old people, and children shouted with all their might: "Welcome Prime Minister U Nu!" "Welcome General Ne Win!" "Long live Sino-Burmese friendship!" "Long live the great unity of the people of the world!"

　　On the vast Tiananmen Square, the welcoming crowd immediately erupted in a joyous climax as more than a hundred guest vehicles circled the square. At this time, the square was ablaze with lights, and the powerful beams of the spotlights illuminated the slogan "Long Live the Great Unity of the People of the World" with extraordinary brilliance. Strings of colored lights on the majestic Great Hall of the People and many tall buildings emitted a dazzling brilliance like glittering jewels. The square resounded with thunderous applause, cheers, slogans, firecrackers, and joyful music.

　　In the heavy rain, Prime Minister U Nu and General Ne Win enthusiastically used both hands to scoop up the flower petals that people had scattered and threw them back at the welcoming crowd. At this time, a burst of cheers erupted from the crowd, and the solemn and beautiful Tiananmen Square instantly formed a world full of friendship, overflowing with fragrance and flying flowers.

　　People from Beijing who had visited Burma before all waited for the arrival of the guests of honor with the joy of reunion. Rong Hongchang, the deputy chief engineer of the Beijing State-Owned No. 2 Cotton Textile Factory, went to Burma in 1957, carrying the deep friendship of the Chinese people, to help build the Thamaing Textile Factory. In his work, he forged a brotherly friendship with the Burmese workers. Today, Rong Hongchang recalled the friendship of those years and said: "Burmese workers call us: 'Pauk-Phaw.' They say the most enthusiastic things to us, dance the most joyful dances for us, and sing the most beautiful songs. Today, we use great affection to welcome the friendly envoys of the Burmese people, and warmly welcome the envoys of peace who have come to sign the Sino-Burmese Border Treaty. All of this is the loudest counterattack against the imperialists!"

　　When Premier Zhou, accompanied by Prime Minister U Nu and General Ne Win in an open-top car, drove to the end of the welcoming line—the entrance of the guesthouse—the joy of friendship reached a new climax. At this time, a string of firecrackers was lit in the welcoming line, gongs and drums sounded together, and cheers drowned out the sound of the drizzle. People scattered bunches of flowers and colored paper on the guests of honor. Under the illumination of the spotlights, the flowers, colored paper, and sparkling raindrops formed a colorful and charming scene.

　　Here, two Young Pioneers dressed in Dai costumes excitedly threw colored paper at the guests of honor. They were students from the Central Institute for Nationalities from Mangshi, a border town in Yunnan. Fourteen-year-old Dai girl Tang Xiuying, wearing a silver-topped satin hat, has an uncle who lives in Burma; thirteen-year-old Dai boy Dao Guangcheng also visited relatives in Burma with his mother a few years ago. In the winter of 1957, both of them participated in the grand joint celebration of the people on the Sino-Burmese border in the coconut groves of their hometown. From childhood, they have had beautiful memories of Sino-Burmese friendship in their young hearts. Today, they said happily: Prime Minister U Nu and General Ne Win have come, and the Sino-Burmese Border Treaty will soon be signed, how wonderful!

　　Waiting for the arrival of the guests of honor at the entrance of the guesthouse with "Pauk-Phaw" friendship were not only the children of the Dai, Jingpo, and Kawa ethnic groups who share the same river and live on the same mountain with the Burmese people, but also young Mongolians from the grasslands, descendants of Tibetan farmers and herdsmen from the Tibetan Plateau, and Korean girls from Changbai Mountain. Today, it is not only the people of all ethnic groups in the capital who are welcoming the Burmese guests of honor with "Pauk-Phaw" friendship, but also the people of all ethnic groups throughout China. The welcoming line has an end, but the road of friendship between the two peoples is endless, just like the waters of the Nu River, which irrigates the lands of China and Burma, flowing continuously and forever forward.

　　热烈欢迎您，缅甸“胞波”！ 　 首都数十万人在数十华里的街道上冒雨结成友谊长廊
　  大把大把花瓣洒向贵宾，口号声锣鼓声响彻首都上空
    新华社28日讯　新华社记者报道：首都数十万人民今天怀着巨大的热情，在淅淅的秋雨中结成了一条几十华里长的友谊长廊，热烈隆重地夹道欢迎吴努总理和奈温将军，以及全体三百多位缅甸贵宾。首都人民的感情，表达了全中国人民对我们亲戚之邦的友好感情，由于有历史意义的中缅边界条约的即将签订，今天两国人民的这种友谊达到了新的高峰。
    在大雨中，周恩来总理陪同吴努总理和奈温将军，乘坐敞篷汽车缓缓前进。欢迎的群众和全体贵宾的衣服，几乎全被雨水打湿了。但是人们忘掉了这一切。女青年们把鲜花瓣大把地投向贵宾的车上，欢迎的口号声和锣鼓声响彻了首都的上空，两国总理和奈温将军在雨中向欢迎的群众不停地挥手致意。人们兴奋地笑着说，今年周恩来总理访问缅甸时，同缅甸人民一起欢度了缅甸的泼水节，今天吴努总理和奈温将军也到中国来过“泼水节”了。
    缅甸联邦政府这次派出了这样规模空前庞大的代表团到中国进行友好访问，这使中国人民十分感动。北京人民今天冒雨欢迎贵宾所表现出的热情，也深深感动了缅甸贵宾。在整个横贯市中心的数十华里长的宽大街道上，欢迎的群众挤得水泄不通，他们在强烈的聚光灯的照耀下，向鱼贯而来的成百辆贵宾的巨大车队，不停地挥舞旗帜，高呼口号，尽情地倾泻着人们对来自亲戚之国的贵宾们的真诚友情。
    “我住江之头，你住江之尾，彼此情无限，共饮一江水。……彼此是亲戚，语言多同轨，团结而互助，和平力量伟。”这是1957年底陈毅副总理所写的“赠缅甸友人”的诗句。今天，两国人民亲戚般的
  “胞波”友谊得到了新的发展。在一眼望不到尽头的欢迎队伍中，青年们，妇女们，老人们，孩子们，尽情地高呼：“欢迎吴努总理！”“欢迎奈温将军！”“中缅友好万岁！”“世界人民大团结万岁！”
    在广大的天安门广场上，一百多辆贵宾的汽车绕场一周，欢迎人群立即出现了欢腾的高潮。这时广场上华灯竞放，强大的聚光灯光柱，把“世界人民大团结万岁”的标语照耀得格外耀眼。巍峨的人民大会堂和许多高大的建筑物上，一串串的彩灯像晶莹的宝石一样放出异彩。广场上响起了一片雷动般的掌声、欢呼声、口号声、鞭炮声和欢乐的乐曲声。
    吴努总理和奈温将军在大雨中，热情地用双手捧起人们洒过去的花瓣回洒给欢迎他们的人群，这时，队伍中发出了一片欢呼声，庄严美丽的天安门广场顿时形成了一个友情洋溢香花飞舞的世界。
    曾经访问过缅甸的北京人，今天都怀着重逢的喜悦心情，等待贵宾们光临。北京国营第二棉纺织厂的副总工程师荣鸿昌，1957年曾经带着中国人民深厚的友谊，到缅甸去帮助建设达迈纺织厂。在工作中，他和缅甸工人结下了兄弟情谊。今天，荣鸿昌回忆起当年的友谊时说：“缅甸工人称我们：‘胞波’，他们对我们说最热情的话，为我们跳最欢乐的舞，唱最美好的歌。今天我们用盛情来欢迎缅甸人民友好的使者，热烈地欢迎前来签订中缅边界条约的和平使者，这一切都是对帝国主义者最响亮的回击！”
    当周总理陪着吴努总理、奈温将军乘坐的敞篷汽车，驶到欢迎行列的终点——宾馆门口时，友谊的欢乐达到了一个新的高潮。这时，欢迎的行列中燃起连串的鞭炮，锣鼓齐鸣，欢呼声淹没了淅沥的雨声。人们把成束的鲜花、彩纸撒在贵宾们的身上，在聚光灯的照耀下，鲜花、彩纸和晶莹的雨丝，构成了一片五彩缤纷的迷人景色。
    在这里，两个穿着傣族服装的少先队员，兴高采烈地把彩纸掷向贵宾。他们是来自云南边城芒市的中央民族学院的学员。头戴银顶缎帽的十四岁的傣族小姑娘汤秀英，舅舅就住在缅甸境内；十三岁的傣族少年刀光成几年前也随妈妈到缅甸走过亲戚。在1957年冬天，他们两人都曾经在家乡的椰子林里参加过中缅边境人民的盛大联欢，从儿童时代起，他们就在小小的心灵里留下了中缅友谊的美好记忆。今天，他们高兴地说：吴努总理和奈温将军来了，中缅边界条约快签订了，这多好哇！
    在宾馆门口用“胞波”情谊伫候贵宾光临的，不仅有和缅甸人民共饮一江水，同住一座山的傣族、景颇族、佧佤族的儿女，还有来自草原上的蒙古族青年，西藏高原藏族农牧民的子弟，长白山下的朝鲜族姑娘。今天用“胞波”情谊欢迎缅甸贵宾的，不仅是首都各族人民，而且是全中国各族人民。欢迎的行列有尽头，可是两国人民友谊的道路走不完，正像灌溉着中缅两国土地的怒江之水，川流不息，永远向前。
