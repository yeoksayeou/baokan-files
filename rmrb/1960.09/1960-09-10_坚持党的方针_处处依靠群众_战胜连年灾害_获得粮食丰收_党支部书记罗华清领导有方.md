    Adhere to the Party's Policies, Rely on the Masses in Everything, Overcome Years of Disasters, and Achieve a Bumper Harvest of Grain:
    Party Branch Secretary Luo Huaqing Leads Effectively
    Comrade Luo Huaqing is the Party Branch Secretary of the Minsheng Production Team of the Hengdian People's Commune in Huangpi County, Wuhan City, Hubei Province, and a National Model Agricultural Laborer. As the leader of 503 households of commune members, he led the commune members to work hard, overcome years of disasters, develop production at high speed, change the face of the area, and win one great victory after another. In the Minsheng Team, many stories about Luo Huaqing are circulated, vividly depicting the glorious image of Luo Huaqing, this young Communist Party member, this leader—a noble communist style.
    What the Party Tells Us to Do Has Never Been Wrong
    No Matter How Difficult or Hard, We Must Listen to the Party
    In early June of last year, when the Minsheng Team was vigorously engaged in the over-planned production increase movement and production was flourishing, it suddenly suffered two heavy rainstorms, followed by rising river water, which flooded all the crops inside and outside the Minsheng embankment, and then a severe drought of eighty-six days. First flooding, then drought, followed by a large outbreak of pests and diseases. These five major disasters in a row brought great difficulties to the production of the Minsheng Team. A few well-to-do middle peasants shouted "Everyone should find their own way out." Zhao Huasong, the deputy secretary of the production team's Party branch and production team leader at the time, advocated "Don't resist the disasters, abandon agriculture and grab for cash." Luo Huaqing resolutely disagreed. During the first flood, County Party Secretary Gu Bo and Comrade Wu Yongsheng said to him: "The Minsheng Team is a red flag team. It must be a red flag when there is no disaster, and it must also be a red flag when there is a disaster. Resist disaster and increase production to overcome the difficulties." He firmly remembered the Party's instructions and resolutely implemented the policy of taking grain as the key link, resisting disaster and increasing production. Luo Huaqing criticized Zhao Huasong's idea of "abandoning agriculture and grabbing for cash," and advocated "If the large embankment is flooded, quickly drain the water to save the seedlings; if the low-lying fields are flooded more, open up wasteland on the mountains and plant again." He said: "In all these years since liberation, what the Party has told us to do has never been wrong. No matter how difficult or hard, we must listen to the Party." He held discussions with poor and lower-middle peasants in Yangluo Bay, and everyone said: "Farming is fundamental. It's not glorious for farmers to still need the state to supply food." At this time, the county Party committee and the commune Party committee allocated four water pumps and a large amount of seeds to support the Minsheng Team, instructing them to persevere in the struggle against the disaster, which gave Luo Huaqing great strength and encouragement. Then, eighteen Party members were mobilized to lead the commune members into three fronts for a tenacious struggle against the disaster: one group went up the mountain to open up wasteland and plant mung beans, one group went down to the lake to drain the water and save the crops, and a replanting team composed of semi-laborers moved the sorghum seedlings and melons and vegetables that had been flooded in the lake to the mountains and slopes, one plant at a time. At that time, they planted on the mountains when the low-lying lake was flooded, and when the water receded, they went down to the lake to open up wasteland and rush to plant. They fought drought when there was drought, and treated pests when there were pests. Wherever there was disaster and damage, they planted again. In this way, they repeatedly planted more than 10,000 mu and finally harvested more than 4,000 mu, realizing the production plan. This production team achieved a bumper harvest in a year of major disasters, with a total grain output of 1.26 million jin. The state did not assign them a surplus grain task, and they voluntarily sold more than 300,000 jin of surplus grain.
    This struggle once again profoundly educated Luo Huaqing: Listening to the Party is victory. The Party called for hard work and rapid change. He thought: We must open up more wasteland, expand the area, and plant more high-yield crops to harvest more grain. Last winter, as soon as he proposed to expand the opening of wasteland, he won the support of the masses. The plan was revised and expanded again and again to 7,000 mu. At that time, some people said: "The difficulty is too great. It would be very good to only do 3,000 mu this winter, which would be several times more than last year." But Luo Huaqing actively supported everyone's correct opinions. He said decisively: "If we can do it in one year by exerting all our efforts, why should we leave it to be done in two years?" He led the commune members to overcome many difficulties and engage in large-scale wasteland reclamation, finally realizing the great leap forward plan and winning a bumper harvest of summer grain this year.
    The Heavier the Task, the More We Must Consult with the Masses
    The More We Consult with the Masses, the Better Things Will Be Done
    Comrade Luo Huaqing firmly remembered the Party's instructions: The greater the enthusiasm of the masses, the more the Party must care about the lives of the masses. The more the Party cares about the lives of the masses, the greater the enthusiasm of the masses. Last summer, the commune Party committee subsidized Luo Huaqing with twenty yuan for medical treatment. When he got the money, he first thought of the commune members who were resisting the drought under the scorching sun. He did not use a penny of it and bought all the Rendan and Ten Drops of Water for the commune members. When the team lacked bricks and tiles to build new villages, Luo Huaqing demolished the tiled house he had been given during the land reform to support the construction of the new villages. After the new village was completed, Luo Huaqing refused to move in. He said: "I will wait until all 502 households have moved in, and then I will move in as the last household." Later, because a commune member's house caught fire and burned down, Luo Huaqing gave up the thatched cottage he was living in. In this way, he gave up his house three times in a row, doing everything to facilitate the commune members, leaving the difficulties to himself and giving the convenience to others.
    During the drought resistance last summer, everyone was full of enthusiasm. Commune member Li Kaiwen did less work. Luo Huaqing thought that everyone was working, and there must be a reason why Kaiwen was not working, so he personally went to Kaiwen's house. As soon as he entered the door, Kaiwen's wife was sick in bed, and Kaiwen was worried. Luo Huaqing did not mention the matter of work at all. After comforting them, he immediately ran two miles to ask for a doctor, and brought the sugar, glutinous rice, and soybeans that his father used to eat for his illness to Kaiwen's wife, and went to visit them every two or three days. Kaiwen and his wife were moved to tears. Half a month later, Kaiwen's wife recovered from her illness. Since then, Kaiwen and his wife have become Luo Huaqing's confidants and have been very active in their work.
    Comrade Luo Huaqing said: "The heavier the task, the more we must consult with the masses, and the more we consult with the masses, the better things will be done." Therefore, he relied on the masses in everything and closely united the masses around him, drawing endless strength from them. He paid special attention to relying on these three types of people: first, all Party members, who are the backbone; second, the young people in the Red and Expert School, who are the shock troops and take the lead in everything; and third, the poor old peasants as consultants, who offer ideas and act as advisers. At the beginning of this summer, when he was engaged in converting dry land into paddy fields, Luo Huaqing first made a sample, filled the fields with water, but the next day there was still no water in the fields, and all the water had leaked out. At this time, some people said that he was acting blindly and advised him to give up. Luo Huaqing found Wang Weimao, the deputy secretary of the branch, Xiao Shulin, the leader of the shock brigade, and Li Wenxiao, an old peasant consultant, and more than ten other people to think of a solution together in the fields. Li Wenxiao said: "If the field ridge leaks, you can just patch it. There is no way to patch such a large field leak." Luo Huaqing was greatly inspired: "Why can't we patch the field?" After thinking about it for a long time, everyone finally came up with a solution: after plowing, immediately add shallow water and rake, raking and chopping together to create a slurry that can patch the field leak. They tested it on the spot, and it did not leak. They used this "shallow water slurry method" to solve a major problem in converting dry land into paddy fields.
    Go to Work Earlier Than the Commune Members, and Leave Work Later Than the Commune Members
    Go to Production Wherever There Are Difficulties
    Luo Huaqing rarely sits in the team to hold meetings. He calculates, compares, and observes in the fields. When he works, he also holds meetings. When inspecting production, Lao Luo also carries tools with him, and he works wherever he goes. He goes to work earlier than the commune members, leaves work later than the commune members, and rests less than the commune members. Therefore, he does about the same amount of work in a year as a medium-sized laborer. Over the years, he has always taken the lead in labor. In 1958, he earned 2,600 work points, in 1959, he earned 2,800 work points, and in the first eight months of this year, he has already earned 1,900 work points. He not only takes the lead in labor, but also takes the lead in setting an example, working wherever there are difficulties. Some time ago, when harvesting early rice, there was a low-lying lake field in Yangluo Bay, which was flooded two feet deep. Luo Huaqing took the lead in jumping down to harvest the rice and competed with the commune members in separate plots, which greatly encouraged the commune members' enthusiasm for labor. The original plan was to harvest it in three days, but it was harvested in two days. Since the spring of this year, Luo Huaqing has been living in the backward team. The soil quality of the 230 mu of middle rice fields in the Li Jia Wanzi field was bad and had always been backward, so he went there to take the lead in accumulating fertilizer and improving the soil, and he improved it in one season. Yangluo Bay has been losing production for years. Luo Huaqing settled in this small team, mobilized the masses, and helped the small team leader to make specific arrangements. Now, they have expanded the paddy fields by more than 700 mu, which is a larger area than any other small team, and the crops are growing well, and there is great hope for increasing autumn grain production.
    Luo Huaqing himself takes the lead in hard work and practical work, but he does not ask the commune members to work blindly. He does everything possible to make a fuss about the word "change," find a way out, and improve work efficiency. Last winter, when reclaiming 10,000 mu of wasteland, the strip-sowing tools could not keep up with the needs. He and Wang Weimao and Li Wenxiao, after three days and three nights of hard study, finally created a chain seeder with a plowshare in the front to open a ditch, a roller in the middle to sow seeds, and a harrow tooth in the back to cover the soil. One ox and one person can sow 30 mu a day. As a result, the strip-sowing task was completed more than a month ahead of schedule. Not long ago, when he was building sweet potato ridges in Li Jia Wanzi, he discussed with the masses to abandon the hoe and switch to using a rake. One rake is equivalent to six hoes, saving more than twenty man-days. In July alone, the Minsheng Team generally built large rice threshing grounds and promoted cartization, and the seven reforms saved more than 4,000 workdays. In the past two years, Luo Huaqing has led the way in creating new tools and experimenting with new methods, at least twenty or more, but he never said that he created them himself. He always said: "This is the wisdom and strength of the masses."
    He Said: With the Leadership of the Party, I Understand How to Be a Real Person
    In July of this year, the Wuhan Municipal Party Committee issued a decision calling on people to learn from Luo Huaqing and catch up with the Minsheng Team. Luo Huaqing was not complacent at all. He always felt that the work was not finished and the work was not done well. He said at the branch meeting: "We have only opened up a part of our barren lakes, and most of the commune members still live in old houses...The Party is calling for a change of face, but we have not fundamentally changed." At the beginning of July, as soon as the drought showed its head, he led 112 capable laborers, organized 42 waterwheels and 4 water pumps to resist the drought and seize grain. Lei Zutian, the captain of the fourth squad, originally did not plan to save the 30 mu of middle rice in Zhu Jia Chong and Lubiangang, which lacked water sources. After he discovered it, he found a water source by the railway with the small team leader, moved water to turn over the slopes, and diverted water to irrigate the fields. In this way, all 898 mu of middle rice that was about to be harvested in the entire production team were irrigated with the last meal of water, ensuring the bumper harvest of 1,400 mu of middle rice. Now, other crops are also managed well. Even though the drought resistance is so tense, he still insists on the other hand of opening up wasteland. Now, the whole team has opened up a large area of wasteland, and the autumn sowing area this year will be expanded to 15,000 mu, which is double that of last year.
    Luo Huaqing, what is it that has tempered this young, ordinary Communist Party member into a strong communist fighter with a noble style? Luo Huaqing said: "It is the Party! I suffered from hardship and misfortune since I was a child, herding cattle as a hired hand, and I didn't understand anything. With the leadership of the Party, I turned over to see the sun. I understood how to be a real person, and I understood that communism is the most beautiful ideal of mankind. The more I do, the more hopeful I become."

    坚持党的方针　处处依靠群众　战胜连年灾害　获得粮食丰收
    党支部书记罗华清领导有方
    罗华清同志，是湖北省武汉市黄陂县横店人民公社民生生产队的党支部书记、全国农业劳动模范。作为五百零三户社员的带路人，他领导着社员，发奋图强，战胜了连年的灾害，高速度发展生产，改变面貌，夺得了一个接连一个的巨大胜利。在民生队，传颂着许许多多关于罗华清的故事，生动地描绘了罗华清这个年轻的共产党员、这个带路人的光辉形象——崇高的共产主义风格。
    党叫干的事，没有一次不对头
    再困难，再艰苦，也要听党的话
    去年6月初，民生队正在大闹超规划增产运动、生产一片欣欣向荣的时候，突然遭受了两场暴雨的袭击，接着又是江水上涨，把民生垸堤内外的庄稼淹个精光，后来又是大旱八十六天。先淹后旱，病虫大发。这一连五次大灾，给民生队的生产带来了极大的困难。少数富裕中农叫喊“各找门路”。当时的生产队党支部副书记、生产队长赵华松主张“不抗灾害，丢掉农业去抓现钱”。罗华清坚决不同意。第一次淹水时，县委书记古博同志、武永胜同志对他说：“民生队是红旗队，无灾时是红旗，受灾时也要是红旗，抗灾增产，生产度荒。”他牢牢记住了党的指示，坚决贯彻以粮为纲、抗灾增产的方针。罗华清批判赵华松那种“丢掉农业去抓现钱”的思想，主张“大垸子淹了，赶快排渍救秧苗；低田淹得多，上山开荒再种”。他说：“解放这多年来，党叫干的事，没有一次不对头，再困难，再艰苦，也要听党的话。”他在阳逻湾和贫农、下中农座谈，大家都说：“种田是根本。庄稼汉还要国家供应口粮，多不光彩。”这时候，县委和公社党委拨来了四台抽水机和大批种子支援民生队，指示他们坚持抗灾斗争，这给了罗华清巨大的力量和鼓舞。接着动员了十八名党员带领社员群众分为三条战线进行着顽强的抗灾斗争：一支人上山开荒种绿豆，一支人下湖排渍救庄稼，一支半劳力组成的移栽和补种队，把湖里被淹了的高粱苗子和瓜菜，一蔸蔸地搬到山上、坡上。当时，低湖淹了就上山去种，水退了又下湖开荒抢播，有旱抗旱，有虫治虫，哪里遭灾受损，就在哪里又种，这样反复地播种一万多亩，终于收了四千多亩，实现了生产规划。这个生产队在大灾之年，取得了丰收，粮食总产量达到了一百二十六万斤，国家没有分配他们公余粮任务，他们主动卖了三十多万斤余粮。
    这一场斗争，使罗华清再一次受到了深刻的教育：听党的话，就是胜利。党号召艰苦奋斗，高速度地改变面貌。他就想到：一定要多开荒扩大面积、多种高产多收粮食才行。去年冬，他一提出扩大开荒，就得到群众的拥护，规划经过修改，一再扩大为七千亩。当时也有人说：“困难太大了，今冬只搞三千亩，也比去年翻了几番，很不错了。”但罗华清积极支持了大家的正确意见，他斩钉截铁地说：“能够鼓足干劲一年办到，为什么要留做两年办呢？”他领导社员们克服重重困难，大搞开荒，终于实现了大跃进的规划，夺得了今年夏粮大丰收。
    任务越重，越要和群众商量
    越和群众商量，事情越做得好
    罗华清同志牢牢地记住了党的指示：群众的干劲越大，党越是要关心群众生活。党越是关心群众生活，群众的干劲就越大。去年夏天，公社党委补助二十块钱给罗华清治病，他拿到钱，却先想到正在顶着大太阳抗旱的社员们，分文未用，全部买了人丹、十滴水，给了社员们。队里修新村缺砖瓦，罗华清把土改分来的瓦屋拆掉了，支援了修新村。新村建成后，罗华清不肯搬进去，他说：“要等五百零二户人家全搬进去了，我这最后一户才搬。”以后，由于一户社员家失火，把房子烧了，罗华清又把住的茅屋让了。就这样，接连三次让房，一切为了方便社员，把困难留给自己，方便送给别人。
    去年夏季抗旱，大家都干劲十足，社员李开文出工少，罗华清想，大家都在干，开文不出工，一定有原因，就亲自上门去找开文。一进门，开文老婆病在床上，开文正在那里发愁，罗华清根本不提出工的事，安慰了他们一番，马上跑两里路去请医生，又把自己家里父亲养病吃的糖、糯米、黄豆，都给开文老婆送去了，并且三天两日跑去看望。开文夫妻俩都感激得流泪。半月以后，开文老婆的病好了，从此，开文夫妻成了罗华清的知心朋友，劳动十分积极。
    罗华清同志说：“任务越重，越要和群众商量，越和群众商量，事情越做得好。”因此，他事事依靠群众，把群众紧密地团结在自己的周围，从中吸取了无穷无尽的力量。他特别注意依靠这三方面的人，一是全体党员，这是骨干；二是红专学校的青年小伙子，是突击队，遇事打先锋；三是贫农老头当顾问，出主意当参谋。今年夏初搞旱地改水田，罗华清先做了一块样子，放水灌田，第二天田里还是没有水，漏个精光。这时，有人说他蛮干，劝他丢手算了。罗华清找支部副书记王维么、突击队长萧树林、老农顾问李文孝等十多人一起在田头想办法。李文孝说：“田埂子漏了，一糊就行。这大的田漏，可没有办法糊住。”罗华清大受启发：“为什么不能糊田呢？”大家琢磨了半天，终于想出了办法：犁了以后，马上放浅水加耙，连耙带宰，搞成了泥浆，就能把田漏糊住。当场试验，果然不漏了。就用这个“浅水灌浆法”，解决了旱地改水田的一个大难题。
    出工比社员早，收工比社员迟
    哪里有困难，就到哪里参加生产
    罗华清很少坐在队里开会，都是在田里算、比、看。劳动了，会也开了。检查生产，老罗也随身带工具，到哪里就在哪里干。出工比社员早，收工比社员迟，休息比社员少。所以，他一年干的活，和一个中等劳动力差不多。几年来，他一直带头劳动，1958年，他做了二千六百个工分，1959年做了二千八百个工分，今年的头八个月，已经做了一千九百个工分。他不光带头劳动，而且带头做样板，哪里有困难就在哪里干。前些时，割早谷，阳逻湾有一片低湖田，淹在水里两尺深，罗华清带头跳下去割谷，并且和社员分块比赛，大大鼓舞了社员的劳动热情，原计划三天收割完的，两天就割完了。今年春天以来，罗华清一直住在落后队，李家垸子一畈二百三十亩中稻田土质坏，老落后，他就到那里带头积肥改土，一季就改过来了。阳逻湾连年赔产，罗华清到这个小队落了户，发动了群众，帮助小队长作了具体的安排，现在扩大了水田七百多亩，面积比哪个小队都大，庄稼又长得好，秋粮增产大有希望。
    罗华清自己带头苦干、实干，却不叫社员硬拼，他千方百计从“改”字上做文章，找出路，提高工效。去冬开荒万亩，条播工具赶不上需要，他和王维么、李文孝经过三天三夜的苦钻苦学，终于创造出一种前头犁头开沟，中间滚筒播种，后面耙齿盖土的连环播种器。一牛一人，一天能播三十亩，结果，提前一个多月完成了条播的任务。不久以前，他在李家垸子打苕埂，和群众商量丢掉锄头改用扯耙，一把扯耙顶六张锄头，节省了二十多个人工。仅7月份一个月，民生队普遍做大稻场、搞车子化等，七项改革节省了劳动日四千多个。两年来，罗华清带头创造的新工具，试验的新办法，少说也有二十多种，但是他从不说是自己创造的，他总是说：“这是群众的智慧和力量。”
    他说：有了党的领导，我才懂得怎样做一个真正的人
    今年7月，武汉市委发布决定，号召学赶罗华清，学赶民生队，罗华清毫不自满，他总觉得工作没有做完、工作没有做好。他在支部会上说：“我们的荒湖滩，还只开了一部分，社员们多数还是住的旧房子……，党号召改变面貌，我们还没有从根本上变过来。”7月初，旱情一露头，他就带着一百一十二名精悍的劳动力，组织了四十二乘水车、四台抽水机，抗旱夺粮。缺乏水源的朱家冲和路边岗三十亩中稻，四小队队长雷祖田原来不打算救的，他发现后，就和小队长在铁路边找到了水源，搬水翻岗，引水灌田，这样使全生产队脱水的八百九十八亩快收割的中稻，全部灌上了最后一餐水，保住了一千四百亩中稻的丰收。现在，其他作物也管得较好。抗旱这样紧张，开荒这一只手还是坚持不放，现在，全队又开出大片荒地，今年的秋播面积将扩大到一万五千亩，比去年又翻一番。
    罗华清，这个年轻的、普通的共产党员，是什么把他锻炼成一个坚强的具有崇高风格的共产主义战士？罗华清说：“是党！我从小受苦遭孽，放牛当长工，什么也不懂，有了党的领导，我才翻身见太阳，我才懂得怎样做一个真正的人，才懂得共产主义是人类最美好的理想，越干越有奔头。”
