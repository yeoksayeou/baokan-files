Xinhua News Agency, San José, 24th: Costa Rican legislator Marcial Aguiluz recently spoke at a mass meeting in San José, the capital of Costa Rica, about his impressions of his recent visit to China. Aguiluz said, "My personal opinion is that the Chinese revolution is the most profound revolution." He emphasized that a country once full of diseases, illiteracy, and mass deaths caused by war is now victoriously carrying out socialist construction.

Aguiluz visited China in August at the invitation of the Chinese People's Institute of Foreign Affairs.

Aguiluz said that his visit confirmed that the propaganda that Chinese workers and farmers are engaged in labor under military terror is an imperialist slander. He said, "I saw the Chinese people working with great enthusiasm, but I didn't see anyone wielding weapons." He also said that the Chinese people are working enthusiastically because they know that the fruits of their labor will be returned to them through wages, medical care, cultural entertainment, and so on. Aguiluz said that from the day he accepted the invitation to visit China, he was pressured by the U.S. Embassy, because the imperialists feared that honest people would tell the truth about socialist countries after visiting them.

Aguiluz also talked about his impressions of visiting the Soviet Union and Czechoslovakia. He expressed his admiration for the great achievements made by the Soviet government in improving the people's living and cultural standards.

Another Costa Rican legislator, Néstor López of the National Republican Party, who visited China at the same time as Aguiluz, recently told a reporter from the Costa Rican newspaper "La Nación": "In China, people are transforming their living conditions, which will undoubtedly have a profound impact on the fate of mankind. People are turning a poor country—where thousands of people used to starve to death every year—into a vast base of industrial and agricultural production."

Néstor López also pointed out: The socio-political face of China is amazing. One should not close one's eyes and refuse to acknowledge this fact.

### 哥斯达黎加议员访问我国后指出　中国正在胜利地建设社会主义

　　哥斯达黎加议员访问我国后指出
　　中国正在胜利地建设社会主义
    新华社24日讯　圣约瑟消息：哥斯达黎加议员马西亚尔·阿吉卢斯最近在哥斯达黎加首都圣约瑟的一次群众集会上谈到他最近访问中国的观感。阿吉卢斯说，我个人的意见是：中国革命是最深刻的一次革命。他强调指出，曾经充满着各种疾病、文盲和由于战争造成大量死亡的国家，现在正在胜利地进行着社会主义建设。
    阿吉卢斯是应中国人民外交学会的邀请，在8月间到中国访问的。
    阿吉卢斯说，他的访问证实了那种硬说中国的工人、农民是在军事恐怖下从事劳动的宣传是帝国主义的诽谤。他说，“我看到中国人民都以饱满的热情在进行劳动，但是没有见到任何人在挥动武器。”他又说，中国人民热情地劳动着，因为他们知道，劳动的果实将通过例如工资、医疗护理、文化娱乐等等方式归还他们。阿吉卢斯说，他从接受访问中国的邀请那一天起，就遭到美国大使馆的压力，因为帝国主义惧怕诚实的人在访问社会主义国家以后会说出这些国家的真实情况。
    阿吉卢斯还谈到了他访问苏联和捷克斯洛伐克的印象。他对苏联政府在提高人民的生活和文化水平方面所取得的巨大成就表示钦佩。
    跟阿吉卢斯同时访华的另一位哥斯达黎加议员、民族共和党的内斯托·洛佩斯不久前曾向哥斯达黎加“民族报”记者说：“在中国，人们正在改造自己的生活条件，这无疑将在人类的命运上发生深刻的影响。人们正把一个贫穷的国家——以前这里每年要饿死成千上万的人——变成一个广大的工农业生产的基地。”
    内斯托·洛佩斯还指出：中国的社会政治面貌是令人惊奇的。对这个事实不应该采取闭起眼睛拒绝承认的态度。
