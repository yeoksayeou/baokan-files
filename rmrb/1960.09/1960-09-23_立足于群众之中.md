　　Rooted Among the Masses
　　Bai Zi
　　An important hallmark of a good cadre and a good Party member at the rural grassroots level is their ability to go deep among the masses, be rooted among the masses, take the lead in labor, participate in production, and lead production. Only in this way can they lead production well, truly understand the labor and lives of the masses, care about their concerns, and be true confidants of the masses. Comrade Zhan Jixie, the Party Branch Secretary of the Yuanxi Brigade in Chengguan Commune, Youxi County, Fujian, is such a good example.
　　Comrade Zhan Jixie has been working for ten years. For the past ten years, he has always maintained the industrious and simple character of the working people. Whether in production or in life, he can blend in with the masses and set an example for them in everything he does. He holds a leadership position in grassroots organizations, but he has consistently participated in production with the masses throughout the years. He is not only a leader in production, but also an ordinary worker. He never gives up the opportunity to directly participate in agricultural labor. Even when attending meetings in the county, he always carries a bamboo basket with him, making sure not to waste time and never traveling empty-handed. Therefore, the masses affectionately call him "Secretary Who Picks Up Manure." With his actions, he deeply tells the masses that labor is the first need of life and that labor is the most glorious. Zhan Jixie puts all his energy into labor production in this way. He not only labors well himself, but can also motivate commune members to labor well together. He cares about the labor situation of the masses in every aspect, observes various problems in production, and guides the masses in production in a thorough and meticulous manner. Wherever there is difficulty, wherever there is a problem, he appears there. His relationship with the masses is truly "like fish and water, complementing each other."
　　In his actual work, Zhan Jixie is a faithful executor of the Party's policies and a good grassroots cadre of the Party who maintains close ties with the masses. From him, we not only see the valuable industrious and simple nature of the working people, but also see a vivid image of a Communist Party member and rural grassroots cadre who is rooted among the masses, shares the same breath with the masses in labor, and has the spirit of "willing to be an ox for the people." This style, this spirit, and this character are deeply worthy of our study.
　　Today, under the Party's cultivation and education, a large number of good grassroots cadres like Zhan Jixie have grown up in the countryside. They come from the masses, go to the masses, can maintain close ties with the masses, serve the masses diligently, and work hard and diligently in labor and work. This is precisely the guarantee of our Party's victory in rural work. All our rural grassroots cadres should be like Zhan Jixie, have a strong mass viewpoint and labor viewpoint, be rooted among the masses, go deep into the front line of production, and lead the production army "taking the lead" to continuously achieve victories on the agricultural front.

　　立足于群众之中
　　柏子
    作为一个农村基层的好干部、好党员，重要的标志，就在于能深入到群众中去，立足于群众之中，带头劳动，参加生产领导生产。只有这样，他才能把生产领导好，才能真正熟悉群众的劳动和生活，关心群众的痛痒，做群众的知心朋友。福建尤溪县城关公社园溪大队党支部书记詹基燮同志，就是这样一个好榜样。
    詹基燮同志参加工作十年了。十年来，他始终保持着劳动人民勤劳质朴的本色，无论在生产上、生活上都能和群众打成一片，处处为群众树立了榜样。他担任基层组织的领导职务，但长年坚持和群众一起参加生产。他不仅是生产的领导者，而且是普通的劳动者。他从不放弃直接参加农业劳动的机会，甚至到县里开会时，他也总是把畚箕随身带上，做到时不空过，路不空行。因此，群众还亲昵地称他是“拾粪书记”。他用自己的行动，深深地告诉了群众，劳动是生活的第一需要，劳动是最光荣的。詹基燮就是这样把全副精神都放在劳动生产上。他不仅自己劳动好，还能带动社员一起劳动好。他处处关心群众的劳动情况，洞察生产中的各种问题，深入细致地指挥群众生产。那里有困难，那里有问题，他就出现在那里。他和群众的关系真是“如鱼得水，相得益彰”。
    詹基燮在实际工作中，是党的政策的忠实执行者，又是党的密切联系群众的基层好干部。从他的身上，我们不仅看到了劳动人民可贵的勤劳质朴的本质，也看到了一个生根在群众之中，同群众同劳动共呼吸，具有“俯首甘为孺子牛”精神的共产党员、农村基层干部的生动形象。这种作风，这种精神和风格，是深深值得我们学习的。
    今天，在党的培养教育下，农村里已经生长起大批像詹基燮一样从群众中来，到群众中去，能密切联系群众，勤勤恳恳为群众服务，在劳动中和工作中勤劳踏实、埋头苦干的基层好干部。这也正是我们党在农村工作中胜利的保证。我们所有的农村基层干部，都应该像詹基燮一样，有强烈的群众观点和劳动观点，立足于群众之中，深入生产第一线，“身先士卒”地领导生产大军，在农业战线上不断地取得胜利。
