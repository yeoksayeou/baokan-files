    Base for Cultivating Talents of All Ethnic Groups
    A Visit to the Northwest Nationalities Institute
    By Our Correspondent Gan Zhi'ang
    At the foot of the majestic Mount Gaolan in Lanzhou stands a magnificent group of buildings in a national style, which is the highest institution of learning for cultivating talents for various ethnic minorities in Northwest China—the Northwest Nationalities Institute. In this national institute, the earliest of its kind established in the country, more than 3,500 students from twenty ethnic groups, including Mongolian, Tibetan, Hui, Uyghur, Kazakh, and Dongxiang, from all over Northwest China, are studying diligently under the kind care and guidance of the Party. This is a new type of institution of learning, a concrete manifestation of the Party's glorious national policy, and a microcosm of the united and harmonious national family of the motherland.
    From Serfs to University Students
    In the past, the farmers and herdsmen of various ethnic minorities in Northwest China were deprived of the right to education and plunged into poverty, backwardness, and ignorance under the cruel and reactionary rule. Today, most of the students studying at this institute are former herdsmen and poor peasants. The preparatory course of the institute has two classes with more than eighty students, all of whom came from Tibet in 1958 and have just been completely liberated serfs. They share a common experience, and even their frail bodies, ravaged by torture, bear similar scars and whip marks when they first arrived at the institute. When we visited these young people who are now living a happy life of study, they angrily denounced their past history full of blood and tears.
    The new and old life of the seventeen-year-old Danzeng Caiwang from Dagong Village is a common portrayal of his partners. His family of seven were all slaves of the nobility. From the age of eight, Danzeng Caiwang served as a "dog slave," serving the noble master's dozen or so large dogs, but his life was far inferior to these animals. After the Chinese People's Liberation Army and the government working group came to this area, they distributed loans to poor farmers and herdsmen, helped with production and medical treatment, and explained revolutionary principles. From then on, young Danzeng Caiwang's horizons were broadened, and he learned that there was another kind of life in the world. After the suppression of the Tibetan counter-revolutionary rebellion, Danzeng Caiwang was liberated from his old slave life and entered the Nationalities Institute, which he had never dreamed of before. In just one year, Danzeng Caiwang has gone from being skinny to being strong and fat, with a round face full of joy and happiness. All his grades are five, and he has joined the Communist Youth League, becoming one of the best students in the class. The happiness of young people of all ethnic groups living in the Mao Zedong era is common. Danzeng Caiwang's classmates, like him, have received the motherly nurturing and guidance of the institute. After a year of study, most of the students have achieved excellent grades.
    Growing Up in Sunshine and Rain
    The Lanzhou-Xinjiang, Lanzhou-Qinghai, and other railways, which run through the border areas and the interior of the motherland, are advancing rapidly or are about to advance rapidly into various ethnic minority areas. In order to meet the needs of this situation, the Northwest Nationalities Institute established the Department of Nationalities Railway in 1958 to train railway transportation workers of various ethnic minorities. This is one of the departments of the institute that studies regular university courses. Forty young students from five ethnic groups, including Uyghur, Kazakh, Tatar, Kirgiz, and Uzbek, are studying in this department. Under the patient guidance of the school, they are studying hard with the enthusiasm to quickly participate in the socialist construction of the motherland and develop the economic and cultural undertakings of their own ethnic groups. At the end of the first academic year, the excellent grades of all students in the department reached 92%. After the beginning of the second academic year, they have entered the study of professional courses, and their grades are still good, becoming one of the red flag classes in the entire institute.
    At the institute, we also heard the story of the growth of Zhou Bencairang, my country's first Tibetan film actor. Zhou Bencairang was born on the grassland of Haixi Mongolian-Tibetan-Kazakh Autonomous Prefecture in Qinghai Province. When he was sent to the Northwest Nationalities Institute to study in 1953, the Party discovered his talent and soon transferred him to the Nationalities Song and Dance Troupe of the institute to train him as an actor. In 1957, he was sent to the Central Nationalities Song and Dance Troupe for further studies. Last year, the Party recommended him to participate in the filming of the color film "The Yellow River Crossing," playing one of the main characters, Ding Juncai. Many minority youth at the college like Zhou Bencairang, have awakened from a state of ignorance, growing up strong and blooming into bright flowers under the sunshine and rain. For many students, because they were previously under extremely barbaric reactionary rule and lost the most basic human rights, the college must not only impart advanced science and culture to them and improve their ideological awareness, but also start from the most basic life knowledge and hygiene habits. The school is not only a teacher, but also a loving mother. If we understand this, then we cannot help but be surprised and excited by the following learning and research achievements! Since this year, teachers and students of the whole institute have completed 123 scientific research projects. These projects include Marxist-Leninist theory, national policies and national history, national languages, national education, and medical and health care. Among them, the "Comprehensive Tibetan-Chinese Dictionary" is a vast and rich volume with more than 80,000 entries, making it the most comprehensive work of its kind in the country. This was completed collectively by more than 100 students in just over 400 hours. The great achievements of minority students in learning fully demonstrate the victory of the Party's national policy and national education policy. The students of this institute wrote the following verses with infinite sincerity:
    The Communist Party is the benefactor of slaves and shepherds,
    Giving us infinite wisdom and strength.
    You give us a pair of bright eyes,
    We use them to discern the situation on the grassland;
    You give us a pair of strong hands,
    We use them to build a communist paradise;
    You give us a pair of agile wings,
    We use them to fly to lofty ideals.
    Seeds Taking Root and Blooming Everywhere
    From the north and south of Tianshan to the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, from Baiyun Ebo to Qinghai Lake, from Gannan Grassland to the great capital of the motherland, Beijing, there are graduates of the Northwest Nationalities Institute working diligently in different positions. Some of them are outstanding leaders of states, counties, and people's communes, some are glorious soldiers of the Chinese People's Liberation Army stationed on the borders of the motherland, some are doctors and veterinary workers galloping on the grasslands to make people and animals prosperous, and some are translators and teachers who spread advanced science and culture to their own ethnic groups... They are like agile eagles, soaring in the vast blue sky of the multinational great motherland, contributing their wisdom and talents to the socialist construction of the motherland, and painting the newest and most beautiful pictures for various ethnic regions.
    According to statistics from the Haixi Mongolian-Tibetan-Kazakh Autonomous Prefecture in Qinghai Province, out of the 411 ethnic minority cadres in the entire state, 137 were trained by the Northwest Nationalities Institute, accounting for one-third of the total, of which 34 served as leading cadres above the county and commune levels. In Aksai Kazakh Autonomous County, Gansu Province, most of the leading personnel from the production team to the county level are graduates of the Northwest Nationalities Institute. Among them, many people have continued to receive the Party's training and guidance in their work posts, and have thus made outstanding achievements in implementing the Party's various policies, strengthening national unity, and carrying out the socialist transformation and socialist construction in ethnic regions, and have won the Party and the State awards and the support and love of the people of their own ethnic groups. The famous Tibetan nurse Dou Geji and the people's teacher Yi Dan have both gloriously become representatives of the National Congress of Advanced Workers in Culture and Education.

    培养各族人材的基地
    西北民族学院访问记
    本报记者　甘志昂
    兰州巍峨的皋兰山麓，矗立着一片宏伟壮丽的民族形式的建筑群，这就是为西北各少数民族培养人材的最高学府——西北民族学院。在这所全国创办最早的民族学院里，来自西北各地的蒙、藏、回、维吾尔、哈萨克、东乡等二十个民族的三千五百多名学生，在党的亲切关怀与教导下，勤奋地学习着。这是一所新型的学府，也是党的光辉灿烂的民族政策的具体体现，是祖国团结和睦的民族大家庭的缩影。
    农奴——大学生
    在过去的年月里，西北各少数民族农牧民在残酷的反动统治下，被剥夺了受教育的权利，陷于贫穷、落后和愚昧的境地。今天，在这所学院里学习的大部都是从前的牧人和贫农。学院的预科中有两个共有八十多人的班级，都是1958年从西藏来的刚刚获得彻底解放的农奴。他们有着共同的经历，刚到学院时，甚至在被摧残的衰弱的身躯上，都有相似的刑伤和鞭痕。当我们访问这些目前度着幸福学习生活的青年时，他们以愤怒的心情控诉过去充满血泪的历史。
    来自达贡农村的十七岁的旦增才旺的新旧生活，是他的伙伴们的共同写照。他家有七口人，全是贵族的奴隶。旦增才旺从八岁起，就担任“狗奴”，侍奉贵族老爷的十几条大狗，然而他的生活远远不及这些畜牲。中国人民解放军和政府工作组来到这个地区以后，给贫穷的农牧民发放贷款，帮助生产、治病，讲解革命道理。从此，打开了年轻的旦增才旺的眼界，知道了世界上还有另外一种生活。西藏反革命叛乱平息以后，旦增才旺从旧日的奴隶生活中解放出来，跨进了他过去从未梦想过的民族学院里。仅仅一年时间，旦增才旺已从骨瘦如柴变得又壮又胖，圆圆的脸庞上洋溢着欢乐幸福的光采，所有的学习成绩都是五分，加入了共青团，成为全班最优秀的学生之一。生活在毛泽东时代的各民族青年，幸福是共同的。旦增才旺的同学和他一样，都受到学院慈母般的哺育和教导，经过一年的学习，大部分学生学习成绩达到优良。
    在阳光雨露中成长
    贯通祖国边疆和内地的兰新、兰青等铁路，正在或即将迅速向各少数民族地区挺进。西北民族学院为适应这种形势的需要，于1958年建立了民族铁道系，培养各少数民族的铁道运输工作者。这是学院学习正规大学课程的系科之一，在这个系里进行学习的有四十名维吾尔、哈萨克、塔塔尔、柯尔克孜和乌孜别克等五个民族青年学生。他们在学校的耐心教导下，怀着迅速参加祖国社会主义建设和发展本民族经济文化事业的热情，刻苦钻研学习，第一个学年终结，全系同学优良成绩达到92％。第二个学年开始后，他们已进入专业课程的学习，成绩仍然良好，成为全院的红旗班之一。
    在学院里，我们还听到了我国第一个藏族电影演员周本才让成长的故事。周本才让出生在青海省海西蒙藏哈萨克族自治州的草原上。当他1953年被送到西北民族学院学习时，党发现了他的天才，不久就调到学院的民族歌舞团培养他当演员。1957年送他到中央民族歌舞团深造。去年，党便推荐他参加彩色影片“黄河飞渡”的摄制，扮演主角之一的丁俊才。全院许多像周本才让一样的少数民族青年，都从愚昧无知的状态中觉醒起来，在阳光雨露的照耀和滋润下，茁壮地成长，开放出鲜艳的花朵。对许多同学说来，因为他们过去处于极端野蛮反动的统治下，丧失了最起码的人的权利，学院不仅要向他们传授先进的科学文化，提高思想觉悟，而且还必须从最基本的生活知识和卫生习惯，从头教起。学校不仅是教师，还是慈母。如果了解到这一点，那么对以下的学习和研究成就，就不得不感到惊奇和兴奋了！今年以来，全院师生完成了一百二十三项科学研究项目。在这些项目中，包括了马克思列宁主义理论、民族政策与民族历史、民族语文、民族教育和医疗卫生等各个方面，其中像“藏汉综合大词典”，篇幅浩大，内容丰富，词汇达八万多条，为目前全国同类著作中词汇最多的一部。而这正是在一百多名同学参加下，仅用四百多小时集体完成的。少数民族学生学习的巨大成绩，充分证明了党的民族政策和民族教育方针的胜利。这个学院的学生以无限真挚的感情，写出如下的诗句：
    共产党是奴隶和牧羊人的恩人，
    给予我们无穷的智慧和力量。
    您给予我们一双明亮的眼睛，
    我们用它明辨草原风云；
    您给予我们一双健壮的双手，
    我们用它建筑共产主义天堂；
    您给予我们一双矫健的翅膀，
    我们用它飞向崇高的理想。
    种子遍地生根开花
    从天山南北到青藏高原，从白云鄂博到青海湖，从甘南草地到祖国伟大的首都北京，都有西北民族学院毕业的同学在不同的岗位上辛勤地劳动着。他们有的是州、县和人民公社的出色领导者，有的是驻守祖国边疆的光荣的中国人民解放军战士，有的是为使人畜两旺而驰骋在草原上的医生和畜牧兽医工作者，有的是把先进的科学文化传播给本民族的翻译和教师……他们正像矫捷的雄鹰，翱翔在多民族的伟大祖国的万里晴空，为祖国的社会主义建设事业贡献自己的智慧和才华，为各个民族地区描绘着最新最美的图画。
    据青海省海西蒙藏哈萨克族自治州统计，全州四百一十一名民族干部中，由西北民族学院培养出来的就有一百三十七人，占总数三分之一，其中有三十四人担任了县和公社以上的领导干部。甘肃省阿克塞哈萨克族自治县从生产队到县级的领导人员中，绝大部分都是西北民族学院的毕业生。在他们中间，有许多人由于在工作岗位上继续受着党的培养和教导，从而在贯彻党的各项方针政策、加强民族团结、进行民族地区的社会主义改造和社会主义建设工作中，取得了出色成就，获得党和国家的奖励和本民族人民的拥护和热爱。著名的藏族护士豆格吉和人民教师义旦，都光荣地成为全国文教群英会的代表。
