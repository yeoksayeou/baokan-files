    "Hanging in the Air" Three-Story Building: Safe Despite Frequent Earthquakes
    In Ashgabat, the capital of the Turkmen Soviet Socialist Republic, a region prone to earthquakes, a three-story "hanging in the air" building has been constructed. This building is built on an earthquake-resistant foundation. Houses built on this type of foundation do not stand on the foundation itself but are suspended above the ground like a "pendulum." The weight of the pendulum is the building itself. With such a foundation, only the suspension point is affected by the earthquake, and the building remains stationary.
    The adhesion strength between a house built on an earthquake-resistant foundation and the land is only one thirteen-thousandth of that of a regular foundation. Therefore, the seismic force transmitted from the land to the building is also only one thirteen-thousandth of the original seismic force.
    Building such buildings is very important for Ashgabat because Ashgabat is located in one of the most seismically active regions.

### “悬在空中的”三层楼  地震虽多保证安全

    “悬在空中的”三层楼  地震虽多保证安全
    在经常发生地震的苏联土库曼共和国首都阿什·哈巴德建成了一座“悬在空中的”三层楼房。这座建筑物是在防地震基础上建筑的。在这样基础上建筑的房屋，不是立在基础上，而是像“摆”一样悬在地面上。这个摆的重物就是建筑物本身。在这样的基础上，受到地震影响的，只是悬置点，建筑物一点也不动。
    在防地震基础上建筑的房屋与土地的粘结强度只有普通基础的一万三千分之一。因此，由土地传给建筑物的震动力也只有原来震动力的一万三千分之一。
    建筑这样的建筑物对阿什哈巴德是非常重要的，因为阿什哈巴德是处在地震活动最频繁的地区。
