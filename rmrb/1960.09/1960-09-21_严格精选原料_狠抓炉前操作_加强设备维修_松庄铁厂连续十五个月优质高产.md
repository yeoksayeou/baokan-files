　　Songzhuang Iron Plant Achieves Continuous High Quality and High Production for Fifteen Months
      Our newspaper Taiyuan, 20th. The Taiyuan Songzhuang Iron Plant in Shanxi Province has maintained the red flag of comprehensive leap forward with high quality, high production, and low consumption for fifteen consecutive months.
    This factory was commended by the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry from May to December of last year for its high quality, high production, and low consumption. In the first eight months of this year, in addition to continuing to maintain 100% qualification of pig iron quality, the output has also increased rapidly. The utilization coefficient of the blast furnace has been maintained at around two tons, which is almost double that of last year. The coke consumption per ton of iron has been reduced by more than 200 kilograms compared with last year. In the movement to increase production and practice economy, the factory comprehensively summarized the experience of continuous high quality, high production, and low consumption. Each shift, group, and individual put forward targets and guarantees for increasing production and practicing economy, and launched a lively labor emulation campaign of "three guarantees" (guarantee quality, guarantee quantity, guarantee safety), exceeding quotas every day, and becoming all-around red. In the first ten days of September, the plant's pig iron output increased by one times compared with the same period in August.
    This factory was established in the mass movement of Great Leap Forward in Steel Production in 1958. After "five determinations" (determine the location, determine the personnel, determine the leadership, determine the equipment, determine the output), it gradually transitioned from a "small indigenous group" iron and steel enterprise to a "small modern group" iron and steel enterprise. The leadership of this factory has put forward the slogan "Use the least amount of ore and coke to produce the best pig iron; make sure every furnace is up to standard" from the day the first 15-cubic-meter small blast furnace was built in May 1959.
    In order to achieve high output and high quality of iron smelting, all employees of the plant launched a continuous competition to grasp raw materials, grasp furnace operation, and grasp equipment maintenance. The characteristic of their raw material control is to start from the beginning. In mining, a series of effective measures such as ore classification management, water washing of ore powder, and roasting of ore were implemented. In order to eliminate sulfur from the raw materials to the lowest limit so that the blast furnace could be fed with fine materials, the miners and the blast furnace raw material workers launched a competition to overcome the raw material barrier with "three not downs the mountain" and "four not into the furnace." "Three not downs the mountain" are: ore grade not good enough, not downs the mountain; soil and stone impurities not downs the mountain; powder not downs the mountain. This not only improved the grade of the ore but also saved transportation power. "Four not into the furnace" are: insufficient quantity, not into the furnace; uneven particle size, not into the furnace; insufficient grade, not into the furnace; not classified and weighed, not into the furnace. After dozens of experiments, raw material worker Wang Shihua successfully created the "flat ground sintering method," which used a simple method to improve the iron content of the ore and reduce the oxidation components, ensuring that the blast furnace was fed with fine materials.
    In terms of grasping furnace operation, this factory implemented the operating policy of fine materials, large air volume, high temperature, and high smelting intensity. In order to ensure the continuous high production of the blast furnace, they also strengthened equipment maintenance and repair, focusing on wind, water, and electrical equipment. All equipment in the plant, such as raw material crushing, loading, and transportation, is assigned to dedicated personnel who are responsible for maintenance.

　　松庄铁厂连续十五个月优质高产
      本报太原20日电　山西省太原松庄炼铁厂已经连续十五个月保持了优质、高产、低消耗全面跃进的红旗。
    这个厂在去年5月到12月，因为优质、高产、低消耗，曾经获得冶金工业部的嘉奖。今年前八个月，这个厂除继续保持了生铁质量全部合格以外，产量也有了迅猛的增长。高炉利用系数一直保持在二吨左右，比去年提高近一倍。每炼一吨铁所消耗的焦炭，比去年降低了二百多公斤。在增产节约运动中，这个厂全面总结了连续优质、高产、低消耗的经验，各班、组和个人纷纷提出增产节约的指标和保证措施，开展了热火朝天的“三保”（保质、保量、保安全）、日日超、全面红的劳动竞赛，全厂9月上旬的生铁产量又比8月同期提高了一倍。
    这个厂是在1958年大炼钢铁的群众运动中办起来，经过“五定”（定点、定人、定领导、定设备、定产量），由“小土群”钢铁企业逐步过渡到“小洋群”钢铁企业的。这个厂的领导方面，从1959年5月建起第一座十五立方米小高炉那一天起，就提出了“要用最少的矿石和焦炭，炼出最好的生铁；炼一炉要合格一炉”的口号。
    全厂职工为了实现炼铁高产优质，开展了抓原料、抓炉前操作、抓设备维护的连环竞赛。他们抓原料的特点是从头抓起。在采矿方面，实行了一系列矿石分级管理、水洗矿粉、焙烧矿石等有效措施。为了从原料中把硫消灭到最低限度，使高炉吃上精料，采矿工人和高炉原料工人开展了“三不下山”和“四不入炉”的攻原料关的对手赛。“三不下山”是：矿石品位不够不下山；土、石杂质不下山；粉末不下山。这样不仅提高了矿石品位，而且节约了运输力量。“四不入炉”是：分量不足不入炉；粒度不匀不入炉；品位不够不入炉；不分级、过磅不入炉。原料工王世华经过十几次试验，创造成功了“平地烧结法”，用简便的办法提高了矿石含铁品位，降低了氧化成分，保证了高炉吃精料。
    在抓炉前操作方面，这个厂贯彻了精料、大风、高温和高冶炼强度的操作方针。为了保证高炉持续高产，他们还以风、水、电设备为中心，加强了设备维护和检修工作。全厂原料粉碎、上料、运输等所有设备，都由专人分台包干负责维修。
