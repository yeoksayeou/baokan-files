When I read "Song of Righteousness," I always felt particularly moved when I reached the lines: "Alas, this marshy, filthy place, becomes my land of joy and peace. How can there be other hidden crafts? Yin and Yang cannot harm me. I cherish this loyalty in my heart, gazing up at the white floating clouds." In those days, Wen Tianxiang was imprisoned in a small, humble earthen room, his heart filled with longing for his homeland and his patriotic and caring spirit for the people, which made him regard the damp and dark "marshy, filthy place" as a "land of joy and peace," and all the demons and monsters could not harm him. Why? He himself provided the answer: "I cherish this loyalty in my heart." This is the integrity of "wealth and rank cannot corrupt, poverty and meanness cannot move, power and force cannot subdue" that our people have passed down and praised for thousands of years. People use the strongest words like the firmness of steel, the steadfastness of pine and cypress, and the solidity of a bedrock to praise this great spirit and noble moral character.

This lofty spirit has been inherited and carried forward more brilliantly by many great proletarian warriors. Communists have truly maintained the revolutionary integrity of "wealth and rank cannot corrupt, poverty and meanness cannot move, power and force cannot subdue." "Having dismissed worries and hardships as commonplace, I retain my heroic spirit as a prisoner of Chu." This is a poem written in prison by martyr Yun Daiying. "The mountains and rivers of the homeland are magnificent, and the people all look forward to spring. Heroes boast of unification, who will laugh at them later?" This is the last poem of martyr Luo Shiwen. Their heroic spirit of fearlessness in the face of danger and unyielding in the face of hardship truly shines like the sun and moon, and their noble spirit will last forever! Comrade Ye Ting wrote well in prison at the "Sino-American Cooperation Organization":

	The door for people to enter and exit is tightly locked,
	The hole for dogs to crawl out is wide open,
	A voice shouts loudly:
	--Crawl out, and you will be free!
	I yearn for freedom, but I also know deeply
	That a person's body cannot crawl out of a dog's hole!

Revolution and counter-revolution, justice and evil, unwavering righteousness and slavish flattery, preferring death to submission and flattering to seek life, this is the difference between communist fighters and traitors, the difference between humans and dogs.

Today, we read again a posthumous work by martyr Fang Zhimin. This posthumous work is another treasure of the communist arsenal and revolutionary education. The enemy gave him "preferential treatment," hoping to get something from this communist, but their plans fell through. Whether in "preferential treatment" or in an ordinary cell, martyr Fang Zhimin always showed unwavering integrity and an infinitely optimistic spirit towards the future of the revolution. True Marxists, no matter when or in what environment, are always tough guys with spines of steel, always maintaining a revolutionary red heart that hates the enemy, despises the enemy, and disdains the enemy, and always maintaining the revolutionary steadfastness like steel, like pine and cypress, like a bedrock, without the slightest wavering or compromise, and never seeking to "crawl out of a dog's hole." It is relatively easy for a revolutionary to achieve "poverty and meanness cannot move," but it is more difficult to achieve "power and force cannot subdue" and "wealth and rank cannot corrupt." Throughout history, we have seen how many people have weakened and knelt down under the threat of strong enemies, become corrupt and degenerate, and even defected. This is the strict law of history. We communists and revolutionaries must achieve "wealth and rank cannot corrupt, poverty and meanness cannot move, power and force cannot subdue," be neither afraid of hardship nor succumb to any threats or inducements, as martyr Fang Zhimin said in his will, "Do not be pessimistic, do not be timid, fight, and fight persistently and arduously," diligently, wholeheartedly, to defend revolutionary Marxism-Leninism, and to strive for the great ideal of communism throughout our lives!

### 富贵不能淫　威武不能屈

    富贵不能淫　威武不能屈
    郑歌
    过去读《正气歌》，读到“哀哉沮洳场，为我安乐国，岂有他缪巧？阴阳不能贼。顾此耿耿存，仰视浮云白”的时候，总是特别激动。当年文天祥囚居单扉低小的土室，眷怀故土之情，爱国忧民之志，使他把潮湿阴暗的“沮洳场”看作“安乐国”，一切牛鬼蛇神都无法戕害他。为什么？他自己作了答案：“顾此耿耿在”。这就是我国人民千古传诵和赞扬的“富贵不能淫，贫贱不能移，威武不能屈”的气节。人们用钢铁之坚，松柏之贞，磐石之固等最崇高的字眼来歌颂这种伟大的精神，这种高尚的道德品质。
    这种崇高的精神，在许多无产阶级伟大战士身上，得到更加辉煌的继承和发扬光大。共产主义者真正地保持了“富贵不能淫、贫贱不能移，威武不能屈”的革命气节。“已摈忧患寻常事，留得豪情作楚囚。”这是恽代英烈士的狱中诗。“故国山河壮，群情尽望春，英雄夸统一，后笑是何人？”这是罗世文烈士的绝笔诗。他们的临危不惧、临难不屈的英雄气概，真正是光耀日月，浩气长存！叶挺同志在“中美合作所”狱中写得好：
    为人进出的门紧锁着，
    为狗爬出的洞敞开着，
    一个声音高叫着：
    ——爬出来呵，给尔自由！
    我渴望着自由，但也深知道
    人的躯体那能由狗的洞子爬出！
    革命和反革命，正义和邪恶，大义凛然和奴颜媚骨，宁死不屈和谄媚求生，这就是共产主义战士和叛徒之间的区别，就是人狗之间的区别。
    今天，我们又读到方志敏烈士的一篇遗作。这篇遗作是共产主义武库和革命教育的又一件珍品。敌人给他“优待号”的待遇，想从这位共产党人身上得到些什么；但他们的打算落了空。在“优待号”也好，普通牢房也好，方志敏烈士总是表现了坚贞不屈的品质和对革命前途的无限乐观的精神。真正的马克思主义者，无论在什么时候，无论在什么环境里，都是铁铮铮的硬汉，都永远保持仇视敌人、蔑视敌人、鄙视敌人的革命丹心，都保持像钢铁、像松柏、像磐石般的革命坚定性，决没有丝毫的动摇和妥协，决不企求“由狗的洞子爬出”。一个革命者，做到“贫贱不能移”是比较容易的，做到“威武不能屈”和“富贵不能淫”就难了。古往今来，我们看到过多少人在强敌的威胁利诱下脚软了，跪下去了；腐化了，变质了，以至于叛变了。这就是历史的严峻的规律。我们共产主义者、革命者一定要做到“贵富不能淫，贫贱不能移，威武不能屈”，既不怕艰苦困难，又不屈服于任何威胁利诱，如方志敏同志遗书中所说的，“不要悲观，不要畏馁，要奋斗，要持久的艰苦的奋斗”，勤勤恳恳，全心全意，为保卫革命的马克思列宁主义，为实现共产主义的远大理想而终生奋斗！
