Small Knowledge

    Increasing the application of base fertilizer is remarkably effective.
    Base fertilizers applied to wheat fields are mostly slow-releasing organic fertilizers. Applying them early not only continuously supplies nutrients throughout the entire growth period of the wheat, but also has a good effect on controlling the excessive growth of wheat plants in the early stage and preventing premature aging in the later stage. At the same time, sufficient base fertilizer can also improve soil structure, increase soil water and fertilizer retention capacity, and promote the reproduction and activity of soil microorganisms, thereby continuously improving soil fertility.
    Judging from the survey data from various regions, the effect of increasing the application of base fertilizer is very significant. According to a survey by the Crop Research Institute of the Henan Academy of Agricultural Sciences, with the same application of 15,000 catties of pig manure per mu, the yield per mu was 899 catties with 54% used as base fertilizer, 672 catties with 33% used as base fertilizer, and only 541 catties per mu when all was applied as top dressing without base fertilizer, the yield difference was very significant.

    增施底肥效果显著
    给麦田施用的底肥多是迟效性的有机质肥料，提早施用不仅可以在小麦整个生育期间源源不断地供应养分，对控制麦株前期徒长和防止后期早衰有良好作用。同时，施足底肥还能够改良土壤结构，增加土壤保水、保肥能力；促进土壤微生物的繁殖和活动，从而不断提高土壤肥力。
    从各地调查资料来看，增施底肥的效果十分显著。河南省农业科学院作物所调查，每亩同样施猪圈粪一万五千斤，以54％作底肥的，亩产八百九十九斤，以33％作底肥的亩产六百七十二斤，不作底肥全部作追肥施用的亩产仅五百四十一斤，产量相差十分悬殊。
