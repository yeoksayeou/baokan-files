　　Red Flag Furnace Foreman Cao Dexiang
　　Wu Jiahong Li Mingzhi
　　Cao Dexiang, the furnace foreman and Party Branch Secretary of the smelting section of the Ji'an City Steel Plant in Jiangxi Province, was just an ordinary farmer two years ago. Through the Party's training, he has now become a skilled steel worker. In the continuous Great Leap Forward over the past two years, he has been twice named a provincial-level advanced industrial producer. In his work, he always takes the lead, always works in the most difficult positions, regardless of conditions, unafraid of difficulties, working diligently and creating outstanding achievements. In the past two years, he has worked on seven small blast furnaces, many of which were notoriously backward furnaces in the plant. After the Party sent him there, low-yield furnaces became high-yield furnaces, and dead furnaces became live furnaces. People no longer say "When the furnace is smooth, people are smooth," but say "When people are smooth, the furnace is smooth."

　　Going to the Low-Yield Furnace
　　When Furnace No. 6 was shut down for maintenance, Cao Dexiang, as decided by the organization, came to Furnace No. 5 with some workers from Furnace No. 6 to aggressively attack the low-yield Furnace No. 5.

　　Speaking of Furnace No. 5, there is an interlude:

　　Furnace No. 5 is next to Cao Dexiang's Furnace No. 6 and can be said to be a pair of brother furnaces. Both furnaces have a volume of eight cubic meters, and the furnace type and power equipment are the same. However, when Furnace No. 6 achieved a daily output of more than ten tons, Furnace No. 5's daily output had always been only three or four tons, and at its highest, only six tons. The workers of Furnace No. 5 all said: This is an "old cow pulling a broken cart furnace."

　　After Cao Dexiang came to this low-yield furnace, he secretly made up his mind: "I don't believe a low-yield furnace cannot become a high-yield furnace. Even if the furnace is a tiger, I will pluck a few whiskers from it."

　　As soon as he arrived at Furnace No. 5, he first held a meeting with the workers who were originally on the furnace to mobilize everyone to find the reasons.

　　One person said: "This is because the furnace type is not good."

　　Another person said: "This is just a low-yield furnace."

　　Someone else said: "The furnace just can't burn at high temperatures."

　　Cao Dexiang believed that none of these were the real reasons. Cao Dexiang presented the facts, and everyone asked: "You say, where is the reason?"

　　"I don't know either. I think everyone still needs to study it carefully."

　　After the meeting, Cao Dexiang looked everywhere and compared everything to see what was different from Furnace No. 6. He looked all day and felt that there was nothing else different except that the chimney was installed closer to Furnace No. 6. He went to see the hot blast stove and found that the fire at the entrance of the hot blast stove was large, but the fire inside was not red. He thought: Is the problem here? He measured the wind temperature, and it was only two or three hundred degrees. This time, he suddenly realized: "If the temperature is not high, how can there be high output?" He went to see the waste gas chimney and saw that the gas was all running into the chimney. He thought: He had found the key: The chimney is close, the draft is large, the gas is running away, there is less gas in the hot blast room, the temperature is not high, and the wind temperature is not high, so the temperature in the furnace is low, the molten iron melts slowly, and of course the output will be low. He told the deputy furnace foreman, Chen Yong, about this reasoning. Chen Yong agreed with his analysis very much.

　　How to solve this problem? Cao Dexiang thought repeatedly, he studied with his comrades, and finally found a way: Install a flue gate on the waste gas duct in front of the hot blast stove to force the gas into the hot blast stove to burn. At the same time, he moved the combustion nozzle in a little.

　　After doing this, the temperature in the hot blast stove quickly rose to more than five hundred degrees, and the output quickly increased from four or five tons per day to more than ten tons, making the utilization coefficient of Furnace No. 5 exceed one.

　　This news spread throughout the plant. People everywhere were discussing:

　　"Cao Dexiang turned a low-yield furnace into a high-yield furnace."

　　"Cao Dexiang is really a pioneer."

　　"Learn from Furnace No. 5, learn from Furnace No. 5!"

　　People also came to a conclusion from the discussion: "There is no low-yield furnace, when people are red, the furnace is also red."

　　In the plant-wide high-yield movement, Cao Dexiang was like a tiger hunter, wherever there was a tiger, he was there, and his marksmanship was so accurate. The story of him fighting "tigers" spread everywhere in the plant.

　　A Pioneer Who Specializes in Overcoming Difficulties

　　After attacking Furnace No. 5, Cao Dexiang went to High Furnace No. 12, High Furnace No. 13, Furnace No. 8, New Furnace No. 6, and finally came to High Furnace No. 1.

　　When he came to High Furnace No. 1, it was in March, which was the most intense time for the plant to strive for a good start in the first quarter and win the battle for steel. At this time, High Furnace No. 1 suddenly had a major accident: Because the power plant had been shut down for three days a few days ago, it had just started up and encountered "suspended material" at the top of the furnace. Ore and coke had solidified at the mouth of the furnace and could not come down, and the inside of the furnace was empty. It had been three days.

　　This was a new problem, and none of the furnaces in the plant had encountered this situation before. People were whispering:

　　"It seems that it is hopeless."

　　"No matter how capable Cao Dexiang is, he can't solve this new problem."

　　At this time, Wang Youtian, the Secretary of the Ji'an Municipal Party Committee and Mayor, who personally went deep into the Ji'an Steel Plant to lead production, found Cao Dexiang and said: "What do you think we should do?"

　　"We have to find a way to save it, the furnace can't be stopped! Otherwise, how can we achieve a good start?" Cao Dexiang replied decisively. Wang Youtian strongly supported his opinion.

　　Cao Dexiang climbed to the top of the furnace again. In the past few days, his eyes had turned bloodshot, but he didn't want to see the furnace die like this.

　　He deeply felt that the more difficult the time, the more attention should be paid to strengthening the Party's political and ideological work. So he held a meeting of Party members and Youth League members, and then held a meeting of all workers to conduct political and ideological education for everyone. He said: "The experience of the past few years has told me that to make steel, we must have more confidence and determination than steel. If we lack this revolutionary spirit, we are not steel workers. If you are afraid of the furnace, you don't even think about taking steel out of the furnace. Steel is hard, and we must be harder than steel. ......"

　　The workers' morale rose again. Everyone said that if we were afraid of the furnace, we would never have come here. Some people said loudly: "Cao Dexiang, tell us what to do, and we will do it. We will never shout about difficulties."

　　"We have to rely on everyone, rely on everyone to think of a way. My strength alone, no matter how great, cannot make steel bow its head."

　　So, everyone launched a discussion on how to deal with the "suspended material" and finally found a way: Organize a combat team to go to the top of the furnace in batches and shifts, and use tree picks and throw sledgehammers into the furnace mouth.

　　Cao Dexiang and all the workers, four people in a shift, two people using iron tongs to hold the tree pick, and two people throwing sledgehammers, hammered away. After hammering for dozens of minutes, they changed shifts, and they kept hammering like this for three days and three nights and one morning, and finally broke up the tumor on the mouth of the furnace. The "suspended material" bowed its head under the workers' tenacious fighting spirit. The blower rang again. People cheered for the victory of this struggle!

　　However, at this time, because the inside of the furnace was completely empty, after more than 9,000 catties of ore and fuel were put into the furnace, the furnace turned black again. Although the air volume was increased, it could not be burned for a while, and a tumor quickly formed at the bottom of the furnace. People were happy for a while, but then disappeared.

　　Cao Dexiang seemed very calm and composed at this time. Based on his past experience, he proposed to quickly put in pig iron to make the pig iron melt quickly, increase the molten iron in the furnace, raise the furnace temperature, and gradually melt the iron tumor at the bottom of the furnace.

　　Later, they overcame many difficulties and made the furnace burn more and more vigorously. The daily output quickly increased, becoming the most advanced furnace with the highest output in the plant. The average daily output reached thirteen or fourteen tons, the highest output reached more than sixteen tons, the utilization coefficient reached 2.067 tons, and the coke ratio was reduced to 0.8 tons, successfully ensuring that the plant won a good start in the first quarter.

　　Seeing that this dead furnace had become a live furnace and had become the plant's high-yield furnace, everyone admired him and said: "Cao Dexiang has truly become a pioneer who specializes in overcoming difficulties." When Cao Dexiang heard people give him this evaluation, he always said: "Without the Party and without the masses, I, Cao Dexiang, have no ability. This is the leadership of the Party and the power of the masses."

　　× × ×

　　Now, Cao Dexiang is the Party Branch Secretary of the smelting section. He is still the same as before, eating in front of the furnace, sleeping in front of the furnace, and working in front of the furnace all day long. He said: "My heart has long been attached to the blast furnace." The workers still affectionately call him "Old Cao" and "Cao Dexiang." He felt how warm this name was! He could not leave production or this group of enthusiastic workers. Therefore, he started planting "experimental fields" in High Furnace No. 6 again.

　　Now, this eight-cubic-meter Furnace No. 6 has become the plant's high-yield Red Flag Furnace again. The average daily output in July reached 10.72 tons. In the increase production and practice economy movement, from August 1st to 24th, when we left here, the average daily output reached 16.85 tons, and the highest output reached 23.5 tons.

　　The workers said: "Cao Dexiang's spirit of overcoming difficulties and wholeheartedly working for steel is really a role model for us to learn from."

　　红旗炉长曹德祥
　　吴家鸿　黎明芝
    江西省吉安市钢铁厂炉长、冶炼工段党支部书记曹德祥，两年前还是一个普通的农民，经过党的培养，现在已成为一个技术熟练的钢铁工人。在两年来连续大跃进中，曾两次被评为全省工业先进生产者。在工作中，他总是走在人们的前面，并且总是在最艰苦的岗位上，不计条件，不怕困难，埋头苦干，创造出出色的成绩。在近两年中，他经历过七座小高炉，其中有许多是全厂闻名的落后炉。在党派他去以后，低产炉变成了高产炉，死炉变成了活炉。人们再也不说“炉顺人顺”，而说“人顺炉顺”了。
    到低产炉去
    当六号炉停炉检修的时候，曹德祥经组织决定，同六号炉一部分工人到五号炉来，猛攻五号低产炉。
    说起五号炉，这里有着一段插曲：
    五号炉紧靠着曹德祥的六号炉，可说是一对兄弟炉。两个炉子都是八立方米的容积，炉型和动力设备也都是一样的。可是，六号炉日产达到十多吨时，五号炉日产却始终只有三、四吨，最高时也只有六吨。五号炉的工人都说：这是一个“老牛拉破车炉”。
    曹德祥来到这座低产炉以后，就暗地里下了狠心：“我就不相信低产炉不能变高产炉，炉子就是一只老虎，我也要拔它几根须。”
    他一来到五号炉，首先就和原来炉上的工人开了一个会，发动大家找原因。
    这个说：“这是炉型不好。”
    那个说：“这就是一个低产炉。”
    还有人说：“炉子就是烧不起高温。”
    这些，曹德祥认为都不是真正的原因。曹德祥把事实一摆，大家都问道：“你说，原因到底在哪里呢？”
    “我也不知道，我看，大家还要很好地研究。”
    会后，曹德祥一个人到处看，到处比，看看有哪些地方与六号炉不同。他看了一天，感到其他地方　没有什么不同，只有烟囱比六号炉装得近了一些。他又去看热风炉，发现热风炉门口炉火大，而里面炉火就不红。他想：问题是不是就在这里？他测了一下风温，只有二、三百度。这下，他恍然大悟：“温度不高，怎能高产呢？”他又去看废气烟囱，只见煤气全往烟囱里面跑。他想：找到了关键：烟囱近了，拔力大，煤气跑了，热风房煤气少，温度不高，风温也就不高，这样，炉内温度低，铁水熔化慢，当然就要低产了。他把这个推理告诉了副炉长陈勇。陈勇很同意他的分析。
    如何去解决这个问题呢？曹德祥反复地考虑着，他与同志们共同研究，终于找到了一个办法：在热风炉前的废气烟道上，装一个烟道闸门，就能把煤气逼进热风炉内燃烧。同时，他又把燃烧嘴移进了一些。
    这样做了后，热风炉内的温度就很快上升到五百多度，产量也迅速由日产四、五吨，提高到十吨多，使五号炉利用系数超过了一。
    这一消息，在全厂传开了。人们到处议论着：
    “曹德祥把低产炉变成了高产炉。”
    “曹德祥真是一员闯将。”
    “向五号炉学习，向五号炉看齐！”
    人们从议论中也得到了一个结论：“没有低产炉，人红炉也红。”
    在全厂高产运动中，曹德祥就像一个打虎的猎人，哪里有老虎，他就在哪里，而且枪法又是那么准。厂内到处都传颂他打“虎”的故事。
        专打难关的闯将
    曹德祥从攻打五号炉后，又到过十二号高炉，十三号高炉，八号高炉，新六号高炉，最后又来到了一号高炉。
    他来到一号高炉时，正是3月间，那时正是全厂为争取第一季度满堂红夺钢大战最激烈的时候。一号高炉就在这时突然发生了一个重大的事故：由于前几天电厂停了三天电，刚开炉不久，就碰到了炉顶“悬料”，矿石、焦炭在炉口上凝结了，下不来，炉内又空空无物，已经三天了。
    这是一个新问题，全厂所有的炉子从没有碰到过这种情况。人们在窃窃私议：
    “看来，是无可救药了。”
    “曹德祥有再大的本事，也解决不了这个新问题。”
    这时，亲自深入吉安钢铁厂领导生产的中共吉安市委书记兼市长王有田找到曹德祥说：“你看，该怎么办呢？”
    “怎样也得想办法挽救，炉子不能停！否则我们怎么能取得满堂红呢？”曹德祥果断地回答着。王有田很支持他的意见。
    曹德祥又爬到炉顶上去了。这几天来，他两眼已熬得血红，但他怎么也不愿看到就这样随便死炉。
    他深深感到：越是在这艰苦的时候，越要注意加强党的政治思想工作。于是他召开了党团员会，接着又召开了全体工人会，对大家进行政治思想教育。他说：“这几年的经验告诉了我，炼钢铁，就要有比钢铁更硬的信心和决心，要是缺乏这股革命干劲，就不算是一个钢铁工人。你要怕炉子，你就更不用想从炉子里拿出钢铁。钢铁硬，我们要比钢铁还硬。…………”
    工人们的情绪又都起来了。大家说，要是怕炉子，我们也决不会到这里来。有的人高声说：“曹德祥，你说要怎么干，我们就怎么干，我们决不叫喊困难。”
    “要靠大家，靠大家来想办法，我一个人的力量再大，也不能叫钢铁低头。”
    于是，大家展开了一场处理“悬料”的讨论，终于找到了一条办法：组织战斗小组，分批轮班上炉顶，用树钎、扔大锤从炉口打进去。
    曹德祥和全体工人一起，四个一班，两个人用铁钳子夹着树钎，两个人扔大锤，一锤一锤地打着。打了几十分钟，又换一班，就这样轮流不停地一直打了三天三晚和一个早晨，终于把结在炉口的瘤子给打散了。“悬料”在工人们顽强的斗志下低头了。鼓风机又响起来了。人们欢呼这场斗争的胜利！
    可是，就在这个时候，由于炉内全空，九千多斤矿石和燃料下进炉子后，又把炉子下黑了，尽管加大风量，一时还燃烧不起来，在炉底上又很快结了瘤。人们一场高兴，顿时又消失了。
    曹德祥这时显得很稳重、沉着。他根据过去的经验，提议赶快下生铁，让生铁获得热快熔化，增加炉内铁水，提高炉温，使炉底铁瘤逐渐熔化。
    以后，他们又经过克服了许许多多的困难，使炉子越烧越旺，日产量迅速上升，成为全厂一座产量最高的先进炉。平均日产量达到十三、四吨，最高产量达到十六吨多，利用系数达到二点零六七吨，焦比更降低到零点八吨，胜利地保证了全厂在第一季度夺得了满堂红。
    人们看到这座死炉变成活炉，而且变成了全厂的高产炉，都无不佩服地说：“曹德祥真成为一个专打难关的闯将了。”而曹德祥听到人们给他的这种评价，总是说：“离开党、离开群众，我曹德祥什么本事也没有。这是党的领导，群众的力量。”
         ×  ×  ×
    现在，曹德祥已是冶炼工段的党支部书记了。他仍然和以前一样，吃在炉前，睡在炉前，成天工作在炉前。他说：“我的心早已粘在高炉上了。”工人们也仍然亲切地叫他“老曹”、“曹德祥”。他感到这是多么温暖的称呼啊！他不能离开生产，离开这群亲热的工人。因此，他又在六号高炉种起“试验田”了。
    现在，这座八立方米的六号炉又成为全厂的高产红旗炉了。7月份日产量平均达到十点七二吨，在增产节约运动中，8月1日到24日，当我们离开这里时，平均日产量更达到十六点八五吨，最高时曾达到二十三点五吨。
    工人们说：“曹德祥克服困难，一心为钢铁的干劲真是我们学习的榜样。”
