Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, 16th. Workers at the No. 1 blast furnace of the Tielchang Iron Factory in Sichuan are conducting an "Every Shift Red" competition, significantly increasing pig iron production. The average daily pig iron production in the second half of August increased by 40% compared to the first half of the month, and in the first ten days of September, it further increased by 13.2% compared to the second half of August.

Since the beginning of this year, the workers of this blast furnace have maintained high production, over fulfilling the plan every month. In mid-August, they further launched a production increase and economy campaign, formulating new leap forward targets. During the discussion of specific measures, they found that collaboration between shifts in the previous month's competition was not ideal. Often, the previous shift only focused on producing more iron themselves, neglecting to prepare conditions for the next shift, which affected the continuous leap forward. After discussion, everyone was educated by the facts and established the idea of "overall first, whole first", launching an "Every Shift Red" competition with three shifts collaborating to achieve high output in every shift.

The "Every Shift Red" competition greatly promoted the communist spirit of collaboration. The three shifts, led by their shift leaders, strictly abided by operating procedures. Before the previous shift went off duty, they carefully prepared work such as charging materials and stocking refined materials for the next shift. The next shift workers came to work early, both to understand the production situation and to assist in the work. The workers handing over shifts also waited until the next shift was producing iron normally before leaving. Material yard work is key to iron production. Furnace rear workers launched a competition of "protecting the furnace front from the furnace rear, and the previous shift protecting the next shift", leaving the difficulties to themselves and giving the convenience to others. They overcame all difficulties, crushed ore according to specifications, ensured accurate weighing, guaranteed uniform furnace charging, and supplied the blast furnace with refined materials and sintered ore. Other types of work also actively engaged in the "Every Shift Red" competition. Power plant workers broke the conventional practice of only repairing machines when they broke down, and insisted on taking turns to repair them, ensuring the normal operation of the machines. In this way, since mid-month, production has continuously increased significantly.

The workshop Party branch strengthened its leadership over the "Every Shift Red" competition. The branch secretary and committee members insisted on implementing a system of taking turns on night shifts. They found problems such as the furnace being prone to cooling down at night and inaccurate weighing of raw materials and fuels. Therefore, they studied with the workers and adopted measures such as strengthening coke analysis at night and strictly controlling raw material specifications, ensuring high output on the night shift. Since the launch of the competition, the average output of the night shift has increased by about 35% compared to the past, catching up with the day shift and achieving a three-shift leap forward.

### 沓水铁厂一号高炉开展“班班红”竞赛  三班协作  班班高产

    沓水铁厂一号高炉开展“班班红”竞赛
    三班协作  班班高产
    新华社成都16日电　四川沓水铁厂一号高炉职工开展“班班红”竞赛，使生铁产量大幅度增长。8月下半月生铁平均日产量比上半月提高40％，9月上旬又比8月下旬提高13.2％。
    今年以来，这座高炉的职工一直保持高产，月月超额完成计划。8月中旬，他们进一步开展增产节约运动，制定了新的跃进指标。讨论具体措施的时候，发现上个月的竞赛中，各班协作不够理想，往往由于上一班工人只顾自己多出铁，忽略了给下一班准备条件，影响到持续跃进。经过讨论，大家从事实中受到教育，树立了全局第一、整体第一的思想，开展了三班协作、班班高产的“班班红”竞赛。
    “班班红”竞赛，大大发扬了共产主义协作精神。三个班以班长为首，严格遵守操作规程，上一班工人下班以前精心作好炉后下料和精料储备等工作；下一班工人提前上班，一面了解生产情况，一面协助工作。交班的工人也等到下一班正常出铁以后才走。料场工作是出铁的关键，炉后工开展了炉后保炉前、上一班保下一班的竞赛，把困难留给自己，把方便送给别人。他们克服一切困难，按规格破碎矿石，做到称斤准确，保证高炉布料均匀，供应高炉精料、熟料。其它工种也积极投入了“班班红”竞赛。动力房工人一破过去机器坏了才修的常规，坚持轮流检修，保证了机器正常运转。这样，从中旬以来，生产就连续大幅度增长。
    车间党支部加强了对“班班红”竞赛的领导。支部书记和委员坚持执行轮流值夜班的制度，发现了夜间炉子易凉，原料燃料称斤不准等问题，便同工人研究，采取夜间加强下焦分析，严格掌握原料规格等措施，保证了夜班高产。开展竞赛以来，夜班平均产量比过去提高35％左右，赶上了白班，实现了三班齐跃进。
