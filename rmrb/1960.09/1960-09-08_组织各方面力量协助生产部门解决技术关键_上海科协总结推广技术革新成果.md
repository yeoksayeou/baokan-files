Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 7th. The Shanghai Science and Technology Association, in close coordination with the development of the technological innovation and technological revolution movement, actively organizes various forces to assist production departments in summarizing and promoting technological innovation achievements, solving key production technical problems, popularizing technical knowledge, carrying out technical theoretical research and training technical innovation backbone elements, and has made remarkable achievements. The work of the Science and Technology Association itself has therefore shown an unprecedentedly lively and sustained leap forward situation.

The Shanghai Science and Technology Association currently has forty-two societies, one hundred and seven professional groups (or industry study groups), and two thousand five hundred and ninety-five grassroots organizations, with one hundred thousand members, spread across the city's production, education, research and other departments, of which technical innovation backbone elements of worker and peasant origin account for about 60%. Therefore, the Science and Technology Association organization has both experts and workers; it is both professional and has a mass character, playing a significant role in the technological revolution movement. At the beginning of this year, after the factory technological innovation and technological revolution movement began, mass technological innovation creations emerged one after another. In order to promote the experience of various factories, the Municipal Industrial Production Committee held twenty-three large-scale exhibitions throughout the city. Because of the tight schedule, many exhibits on display did not have summary data and drawings, which became an urgent problem to be solved in the promotion. After learning about this, the Mechanical Engineering Society of the Municipal Science and Technology Association and the Science and Technology Associations of Yangpu, Hongkou, Huangpu and other districts immediately organized more than two hundred teachers and students from ten universities and scientific and technological personnel from sixteen research, design and production units to go to the exhibition site to carry out technical appraisals and draw drawings of one hundred and fifty-seven innovative projects of universal significance in casting, fitter work, packaging machinery, advanced cutting tools, etc., turning incomplete experiences into complete sets, which was welcomed by all parties. Subsequently, many factories further implemented product revolution, striving to develop towards the production of advanced, precise, cutting-edge and first-class products, and the societies and the Science and Technology Association organized technical forces to come to the door to assist factories in research and experimentation and to break through technical barriers. During this period, many specialized societies of the Science and Technology Association also actively carried out theoretical research on new technologies and new processes, as well as the popularization of technical and scientific knowledge, in order to improve the scientific and technological knowledge level of the masses.

The most important experience in the work of the Shanghai Science and Technology Association is to honestly act as the Party's assistant, to make more articles from the word "cooperate", to do whatever the Party committee asks, and to actively cooperate with whatever the production department needs the Science and Technology Association to cooperate with. In summary, it is "one reliance, two links, and three combinations", relying on the Party committee, linking with relevant departments, combining the strength of workers, peasants, masses, experts, and leading cadres, and combining the scientific and technological strength of production, education, and research departments, and carrying out work closely according to the needs of the technological innovation and technological revolution movement.

In promoting the development, consolidation, and improvement of the technological innovation and technological revolution movement, the first task carried out by the Science and Technology Association was to actively and proactively organize forces to help production departments summarize, identify, and promote effective technological innovation achievements, turning scattered and incomplete experiences into complete sets, becoming complete and systematic technical experiences, so that they can blossom and bear fruit in production; for those projects whose effects are temporarily unstable and whose technology has not yet fully passed the test, it organizes forces to help, so that it can be put into production as soon as possible. The Jing'an District Science and Technology Association organized factories in the district into twenty-nine regular industry collaboration groups according to industry. By arranging projects, arranging key points, and organizing collaboration, it has helped many factories solve key production problems that the factories themselves could not solve in the past six months. The work of the Science and Technology Association organizations in various factories has also been very effective in this regard. Among the seven hundred people in the Shanghai Acid-Resistant Enamel Factory, there was not a single engineer, only four technicians from worker backgrounds and one technician who had studied electrical engineering. Under the leadership of the Party branch, the factory Science and Technology Association organized cadres and workers throughout the factory to form nine study groups, which became the core force of the technological innovation and technological revolution movement. In the past few months, the factory has achieved a total of three hundred and five technological innovations, breaking through seven key production points, and the degree of mechanization and automation in production has been significantly improved. On this basis, the employees also summarized one hundred and forty technical documents and wrote two books, "Quality of Acid-Resistant Enamel Welding" and "Acid-Resistant Enamel Technology."

The second main content of the Shanghai Science and Technology Association's service to production this year is to assist production departments, together with workers and masses, to use the "three combinations" method to theoretically study and summarize new processes and technical experiences, consolidate and summarize and improve the innovation achievements in this area. Through such theoretical research, workers were trained; teachers and scientific and technological personnel from education and research units also learned advanced ideological and production technical experience from them and obtained rich teaching materials and research topics. A recent summary meeting of the Chemical Engineering Society was attended by more than three hundred scientific and technological personnel, students and workers. It lasted for half a month and systematically summarized the important new technologies and new processes created by the chemical industry this year, and exchanged and promoted these experiences. The participants unanimously felt that they had gained a lot. In the first half of this year, the various societies carried out more than seven hundred similar professional activities, researched and summarized one hundred and twenty key projects, and the fourteen district and county science and technology associations summarized a total of three thousand and five technical materials, which greatly promoted the technological innovation and technological revolution movement.

The Shanghai Science and Technology Association at all levels and societies also pay attention to cultivating and improving technical backbone elements and innovation vanguards in the movement. There are two ways to cultivate them: one is to establish temporary special groups and regular study groups according to special topics or professions, and organize them to conduct scientific research; the other is to run amateur technical schools and various specialized study classes to help them improve. In order to meet the urgent need of the broad masses for scientific and technological knowledge, the Science and Technology Association organizations at all levels also adopted the method of crash courses to quickly and widely disseminate scientific and technological knowledge. The Zhabei District Science and Technology Association organized a "lecture group" to conduct crash courses on mechanical principles, electricians, and other knowledge among workers throughout the district in the form of special lectures, training nine thousand three hundred people in half a month. In addition, the Shanghai Science and Technology Association, in order to meet the requirements of the development of the technological innovation and technological revolution movement, has prepared to build a city-wide scientific journal reading center and translation and compilation hall; district and county science and technology associations have organized mass scientific and technological information networks to exchange technological innovation experience in a timely manner; many districts have cooperated with relevant departments to establish simple research rooms, amateur radio research rooms, and testing institutions. These have created convenient conditions for the broad masses of workers to carry out scientific research in the movement. (Attached picture)

    组织各方面力量协助生产部门解决技术关键
    上海科协总结推广技术革新成果
    据新华社上海7日电　上海市科学技术协会密切配合技术革新和技术革命运动的发展，积极组织各方面力量，协助生产部门总结推广技术革新成果，解决生产技术关键问题，普及技术知识，开展技术理论研究和培养训练技术革新骨干分子，作出了显著成绩。科协工作本身也因而出现了前所未有的生动活泼、持续跃进的局面。
    上海市科协目前共有四十二个学会、一百零七个专业组（或称行业学组）和二千五百九十五个基层组织，会员十万人，遍布全市生产、教育、研究等部门，其中工农成分的技术革新骨干分子约占60％。因此，科协组织内既有专家，又有工人；既具有专业性，又具有群众性，在技术革命运动中起了很大的作用。今年年初，工厂技术革新和技术革命运动开始后，群众技术革新创造层出不穷，市工业生产委员会为了推广各厂经验，在全市举办了二十三个大型展览会，因为时间仓促，会上展出的许多展品没有总结资料和图纸，成为推广中急需解决的问题。市科协的机械工程学会和杨浦、虹口、黄浦等区科协组织知道后，立即组织十个大专学校的师生和十六个研究、设计、生产单位的科技人员共二百多人，深入展览会现场，对铸工、钳工、包装机械、先进切削刀具等方面的一百五十七个有普遍推广意义的革新项目，进行技术鉴定、测绘图纸，将不完善的经验配套成龙，受到各方面的欢迎。随后，许多工厂进一步实行产品革命，力争向生产高级、精密、尖端和第一流产品方向发展，学会和科协又组织技术力量上门，协助工厂研究试验和突破技术关。科协许多专门学会在这期间还积极开展新技术、新工艺的理论研究，以及技术科学知识普及工作，提高群众的科学技术知识水平。
    上海市科协工作中，最主要的一条经验是老老实实地做党的助手，多从“协”字做文章，党委叫做啥就做啥，生产部门需要科协配合什么就积极配合什么。集中起来说是“一靠二挂三结合”，依靠党委，和有关部门挂钩，组织工农群众、专家和领导干部力量相结合，生产、教育、研究部门三方面的科学技术力量相结合，紧紧根据技术革新和技术革命运动的需要开展工作。
    在促进技术革新和技术革命运动发展、巩固、提高中，科协首先进行的一项工作，就是积极主动地组织力量，帮助生产部门总结、鉴定、推广行之有效的技术革新成果，把分散的不完整的经验配套成龙，成为完整的系统的技术经验，使之在生产上开花结果；对那些效果暂时不稳定，技术上还没有完全过关的项目，就组织力量去帮助，使它尽早地投入生产。静安区科协按行业组织全区工厂成立了二十九个经常性的行业协作小组，通过排项目、排关键、组织协作，半年来帮助许多工厂解决了工厂自己不能解决的生产关键问题。各工厂的科协组织，这方面的工作效果也很显著。上海耐酸搪瓷厂全厂七百多人中没有一个工程师，只有四名工人出身的技术员和一名学过电机工程的技术员，工厂科协在党总支领导下，组织全厂干部和工人成立了九个学组，成为技术革新和技术革命运动的核心力量。几个月来，全厂共实现了三百零五项技术革新，突破了七个生产关键，生产中的机械化自动化程度显著提高。在这一基础上，职工们并总结了一百四十篇技术资料，写出了“耐酸搪瓷焊道质量”和“耐酸搪瓷工艺”两本书。
    上海市科协各学会今年为生产服务的第二项主要内容，是协助生产部门，和职工群众一起，用“三结合”办法，从理论上研究总结新的工艺和技术经验，巩固、总结提高了这方面的革新成果，通过这样的理论研究，培养了工人；来自教育和研究单位的教师和科技人员，也从中学习了先进的思想和生产技术经验，获得了丰富的教材和研究课题。化学化工学会最近召开的一次总结会，就有科技人员、学生和工人三百多人经常参加，历时半个月，从理论上比较系统地总结了化工部门今年创造的重要新技术和新工艺，交流推广了这些经验，到会人员一致感到收获很大。今年上半年，各学会共开展了七百多次类似这样的专业活动，研究总结了一百二十个重点项目，十四个区、县科协共总结出三千零五篇技术资料，对技术革新和技术革命运动起了很大的促进作用。
    上海市科协各级组织和学会还注意在运动中培养提高技术骨干分子和革新闯将。培养的方式有两种，一种是按专题或专业建立临时性的专题组和经常性的学组，把他们组织起来进行科学研究；另一种是开办业余技术学校和各种专门学习班，帮助他们提高。为了适应广大群众对科学技术知识的迫切要求，各级科协组织还采取突击学习的办法，迅速广泛地传播科学技术知识。闸北区科协组织“讲师团”，以专题讲座的方式，轮流在全区工人中突击讲授机械原理、电工等知识，半个月内培训了九千三百人。此外，上海市科协适应技术革新和技术革命运动发展的要求，筹建了全市科学期刊阅览中心和编译馆；区县科协组织了群众科学技术情报网，及时交流技术革新经验；很多区配合有关部门设立了简易研究室、业余无线电研究室和化验机构。这些都为广大职工群众在运动中开展科学研究创造了便利条件。（附图片）
