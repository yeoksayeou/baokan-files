    This newspaper's Guiyang dispatch of the 21st: In the battle to seize a high-yield and abundant autumn grain harvest, people's communes in rural areas of Guizhou are launching small-scale production competitions, making the current increase production and practice economy movement on the agricultural front both vigorous and down-to-earth. Currently, the later-stage field management work for major autumn grain crops is progressing rapidly and of high quality, with a vivid scene of soldiers competing against soldiers, generals against generals, and everyone chasing each other on the front line of production.
    Guizhou Province's small-scale competitions were launched on the basis of the rural appraisal of "Five-Good" members, "Five-Good" cadres, and advanced collectives. In order to further encourage the labor enthusiasm of the commune members, various localities have summarized their past experiences in carrying out competitions and believe that organizing small-scale competitions in grassroots production units in rural areas is a better way to closely integrate competitions with current production, make them more effective, and organize broader mass participation.
    Small-scale competitions involve fewer people, a narrower scope, and smaller units. From the actual implementation in various localities, it can be a competition for a certain task, or a competition for a certain day's work. It can be a competition between production teams, production brigades, or work groups, or it can be individual contests. In many places, there are also examples of father-son competitions, husband-wife contests, and mother-in-law-daughter-in-law challenges. Small-scale competitions generally focus on agricultural tasks with the greatest potential for increasing production, with very clear goals. The Fourth Team and the Ninth Team of the Changyuan Production Brigade of the Fengyi Commune in Zheng'an County, in the current rice field management competition, proposed conditions such as immediately weeding the rice panicles and applying fertilizer to strengthen the grains, achieving "four preventions" (prevent drought, prevent pests, prevent beasts, prevent lodging) and "four absences" (no waterlogging, no third-class seedlings, no weeds, no pests). The evaluation time for this type of competition is generally determined through consultation between the two parties according to different targets, with brigade evaluations being common every ten days and work group evaluations every five days. As for individuals, the evaluation is done daily, and the winner is determined on the same day.
    Small-scale competitions have the advantages of being easy to check, facilitating the exchange of experiences, and effectively boosting the enthusiasm of the masses due to their specific targets and clear indicators. Each time, the Nine Gate Production Team of the Huiming Commune in Huishui County sends representatives from each brigade, led by the Party branch secretary, to go deep into the fields, check and evaluate at the same time, and promptly announce the evaluation results, commend advanced units and individuals. Brigade evaluations are conducted at the end of each day's work, with one person from each work group sent to inspect and evaluate in the field. The winner is announced immediately, and it does not affect the production of those participating in the inspection. Through inspection and evaluation, advanced individuals are also commended in a timely manner, role models are established, weak links are identified, and laggards are quickly urged to catch up with the advanced. This type of small-scale competition can also more quickly discover constantly changing advanced experiences, advanced individuals, and weak links in work and production. Because the scope of the competition is small, it also makes it easier to promote and exchange some advanced experiences and technologies. The Bishan Team of the Wenhua Production Brigade of the Daguan Commune in Qianxi County adopted the method of seeking opportunities to insert needles, using large shovels to dig up the topsoil to accumulate fertilizer, which not only improved weeding and soil loosening but also prepared fertilizer for autumn planting. After this experience was discovered through evaluation and inspection, it was immediately promoted to each team.
    Small-scale competitions have greatly unleashed the enthusiasm and creativity of the masses. Through the competition, they are doing everything possible to reform tools, improve operating methods, and strive to overfulfill planned targets. According to information from various localities, labor efficiency after the launch of small-scale competitions has generally increased by about 20% to one time. The Shili Production Team of the Panshui Commune in Pu'an County, in the rice field management competition, the entire team rushed to make more than 200 weeding rakes, so that there was one rake per worker for weeding. The Wengpeng Production Team of the Xunluowan Commune in Guiyang improved tools in fertilizer accumulation, and seventy people accumulated and produced more than 900,000 catties of fertilizer in three days, with labor efficiency more than doubling compared to the past.

    紧密结合当前生产　广泛组织群众参加
　　贵州农村开展基层劳动竞赛
    充分发挥了群众生产积极性　劳动工效一般提高20％以上
    本报贵阳21日电　贵州各地农村人民公社，在夺取秋粮高产多收战斗中，开展小范围生产竞赛，使当前农业战线上的增产节约运动，既轰轰烈烈，又扎扎实实。目前，大秋粮食作物的后期田间管理工作进度快、质量高，生产第一线上出现了兵对兵、将对将，你追我赶的生动局面。
    贵州省的小范围竞赛是在农村评比五好社员、五好干部和先进集体的基础上掀起来的。为了进一步鼓舞社员的劳动热情，各地总结了以往开展竞赛的经验，认为组织农村基层生产单位的小范围竞赛，是使竞赛和当前生产紧密结合、更有成效、更广泛的组织群众参加的一种比较好的形式。
    小范围竞赛参加的双方人数少，范围窄，单位小。从各地实际开展情况来看，它可以是某一项活路的竞赛，也可以是某一天活路的竞赛，可以是生产队、生产小队、作业组之间的竞赛，也可以是个人之间的比武。许多地方还出现父子竞赛、夫妻较量、婆媳比武的事例。小范围竞赛一般都是以当前增产潜力最大的农活为具体内容，目标十分明确。正安县凤仪公社长远生产队第四小队同第九小队，在当前水稻田间管理竞赛中提出的条件，就是立即薅谷花秧、追壮籽肥，做到“四防”（防旱、防虫、防兽、防倒伏）、“四无”（无涝、无三类苗、无杂草、无病虫害）。这种竞赛的评比时间，一般是按不同对象、双方协商确定，比较普遍的是小队十天一评，作业组五天一评。至于个人则是逐日评比，谁胜谁负，当天见分晓。
    小范围竞赛由于对象具体、指标明确，具有便于检查、交流经验、和有效地鼓舞群众干劲的优点。惠水县惠明公社九门生产队，每次评比都由各小队派出代表，在党支部书记率领下，深入田间，边检查、边评比，并及时宣布评比结果，表扬先进单位和先进个人。小队评比是在每天收工时进行的，由各作业组派出一人，在田间检查评比，谁胜谁负，马上揭晓，而且不影响参加检查人的生产。通过检查评比还及时表扬先进，树立榜样，抓薄弱环节，促使落后很快赶上先进。这种小范围竞赛，还能够比较及时发现不断变化中的先进经验、先进人物与工作生产中的薄弱环节。由于竞赛范围小，也使一些先进经验、技术容易推广和交流。黔西县大关公社文化生产队毕山小队，采取寻缝插针的办法，大铲土皮积肥，既搞好了锄草、松土，又给秋种准备了肥料。这一经验通过评比检查发现后，立即向各小队推广。
    小范围竞赛大大发挥了群众的积极性和创造性，通过竞赛都千方百计改革工具，改进操作方法，争取超额完成计划指标。根据各地了解，开展小范围竞赛后的劳动效率，一般约提高20％到一倍。普安县盘水公社十里生产队，在水稻田间管理竞赛中，全队赶制了二百多件薅秧耙，使薅秧的劳力达到人手一件。贵阳巡洛湾公社翁朋生产队在积肥中改进工具，七十人在三天中就积制肥料九十多万斤，工效比过去提高一倍以上。
