In the chorus of timely early planting, planting as much as possible, and striving for high grain yields, the summer harvesting, summer planting, and field management campaign in rural Sichuan lasted for three months, directly connecting to the five major agricultural tasks of autumn harvesting, plowing, planting, managing, and storing. Busy agricultural activities have enabled people to create a pleasant and intense working life. In late summer and early autumn this year, we witnessed how the commune members of the Second Production Team of the Satellite Management Area of Jiuxian Commune in Wusheng County were working happily and busily, and learned about the experiences of the in-depth and healthy development of the "double high" (high quality and high work efficiency) movement here.

Chen Deyou, the deputy captain of this team, is a labor model in Sichuan Province. In 1959, he completed an amount of work equivalent to one and a half to two years of work for a person with the same labor force. Production team leader Chen Yuanwen only worked a few dozen labor days less than Chen Deyou in 1959 and is a well-known "double high" pacesetter in the county. Cadres are "double high" when they work, and commune members are "double high" when they work. The average amount of work completed by each team member this year is about 20% higher than the average level of all commune members.

What's the Secret?

During our visit here, we also discovered that after the start of various agricultural tasks in this team, 30%, 50%, or even 70% of the commune members quickly exceeded their quotas. After exceeding their quotas, people also looked for opponents to conduct "double high" competitions. We carefully observed that whenever commune members reached the "double high" targets proposed by the challenge competitions, if they persisted for a while longer, they could have done a little more work, but at this time, the captain and deputy captain always resolutely urged everyone to go back and rest. The production team leader told us: "At this time, letting everyone go back to rest, although they may exceed the quota a little less today, after fully recovering their physical strength, they can complete new tasks more, faster, and better tomorrow." This sentence reminds us that the reason why the work efficiency of this team is so high is because of the combination of labor and rest.

A New Question

In the spring of 1958, when this small team was swept into the Great Leap Forward, all the commune members showed a high degree of selflessness. At this time, branch secretary Wang Dingchang found Communist Party member Chen Deyou and gave him a new question: "... Now, the production enthusiasm of the commune members is getting higher and higher. After repeated discussions, the branch decided to ask you to create an experience that requires both good labor and no fatigue. You must come up with a solution." Chen Deyou agreed with a "good!" as he had always done when accepting the party's tasks. However, this cowherd from twenty years ago, the landlord's long-term worker from ten years ago! A person who has suffered all the hardships of the old society, especially in collective production after liberation, often doesn't think about resting himself. Whenever others劝 him to rest, he would say: "When working for the landlord before liberation, from morning till night, from spring to winter, only the cows were allowed to rest, not the people; now, we eat well, sleep well, and have monthly vacations, how can this tire me out?"

One rainy winter night, when he was inspecting the wheat fields in the rain, he suddenly discovered that a gap had collapsed in the pond embankment, and the torrents were rushing straight into the wheat fields. He jumped into the water without hesitation, using his back to block the gap, protecting the wheat. If you let such a person complete more production tasks, it is obviously not a difficult problem; if you ask this person, who is full of selfless revolutionary enthusiasm, to create an experience that requires both good labor and good rest, undoubtedly, it is a difficult "article" for him.

After receiving the instructions from the branch, Chen Deyou quickly set up a challenge arena, first holding a high-quality and high-efficiency competition with the strong and skilled young people in his team, and he won. Immediately afterwards, he competed with another group of young people, and he won again. In the morning of the third day, not long after the start of the competition, he was at a disadvantage. When Wang Dingchang, the branch secretary of the management area, learned of this situation, he immediately rushed here from other production teams and announced that the competition would end here. Chen Deyou was very anxious and said: "Can't the 'double high' competition only be held for two days? How can this solve the difficulty of lacking labor in the Great Leap Forward?" "No, the 'double high' competition can be held for twenty days, forty days, or even more days, but to achieve this, you can't do it like this..." Wang Dingchang answered bluntly. Subsequently, he inspired Chen Deyou to recall the competition process of the past two days, and together with him, carefully analyzed the steps one by one, and finally found the reason: mainly because Chen Deyou did not stop when he reached the targets proposed by the challenge on the first day, in order to贪图 to do a little more farm work that day, so that he could not recover his physical strength well at night; the same was true on the second day; and there were difficulties on the third day. After this analysis, they summarized a set of experiences in organizing high-efficiency competitions: Before the start of the movement, they should try every means to reform tools and organize people participating in the competition to learn and master new tools; during the challenge competition, the Party小组 and team committee should strictly review the targets proposed by each commune member to ensure that they are advanced and reliable, and also leave room for improvement; before the competition, make all preparations in production and life, and appoint "double high" pacesetters among Party members and members of the Communist Youth League to help their competitors respectively, check whether each estimate, plan, and operation method is correct and clever, and seriously help them improve their operation techniques; once the challenge targets or the time limit is reached, immediately stop the competition, and if both parties reach the targets, give both parties political honor and material rewards at the same time... After this set of methods was created, it played a considerable role in the healthy development of the high-efficiency movement in this team, and it also gave Chen Deyou a lot of education and inspiration.

Ten Rhymes

Since that summary, Chen Deyou has been thinking about the issue of combining labor and rest at all times. He not only tried to make himself work more and have both work and rest, but also used these experiences in daily work allocation to make more commune members like him. He also tried to adjust the labor rhythm of strong adults like him, and observed, studied, and adjusted the labor rhythm of men, women, and extra-grade labor. He finally implemented the spirit of combining labor and rest in daily work allocation and came up with quite a few good ways. These methods can be summarized into ten rhymes:

1.  "Allocate agricultural work according to people." Do not allocate heavy work to weak labor, to avoid being unable to cope; do not allocate light work to strong labor, to avoid idling. Ensure that both strong and weak labor can be competent for the assigned agricultural work, so that everyone can easily recover their physical strength.

2.  "Allocate new, not old." Do everything possible to allocate people to learn to use new tools, not to allocate them to use old tools. Provide care when using new tools for the first time to ensure that the new tools play a role, in order to improve work efficiency and reduce labor intensity.

3.  "Appropriately change agricultural work." Where possible, appropriately replace commune members who mainly share the work of bending over, hoeing by hand, and carrying loads, so as to avoid excessive fatigue in a certain part of the body and improve work efficiency.

4.  "Allocate agricultural work and sideline work." According to the busy and idle seasons of agricultural work, sunny and rainy weather, the strength of the labor force, and the proficiency of skills, appropriately arrange some commune members, after completing a period of shock tasks, to go home and sit down, and use a short time to weave some bamboo and wood agricultural tools urgently needed for production and engage in some sideline production with less labor intensity, without affecting field production.

5.  "Allocate skilled and unskilled." When allocating work, try to ensure that masters bring apprentices, so that novices gradually reduce effort, improve quality, complete tasks on time, and rest as early as possible. At the same time, through this method, cultivate more all-rounders, so that they can be reassigned to other agricultural work according to their physical conditions, to ensure the realization of measures such as "allocating agricultural work and sideline work" and "appropriately changing agricultural work."

6.  "Do not go in and out empty-handed." Use the time when commune members go to work and finish work to bring some fertilizer, feed, fuel, vegetables, etc., so as to reduce the workload of feeders and cooks, so that they can also combine work and rest; and avoid too many transportation tasks piling up, crowding agricultural work, and dragging out working hours.

7.  "Adjust busy and idle evenly." Always pay attention to the imbalance between various agricultural tasks and various procedures, appropriately organize temporary mutual assistance and support, give full play to the spirit of unity and friendship, so that neither exceeds a certain labor intensity, so that commune members can easily recover their physical strength.

8.  "Adjust auxiliary work well." Before精兵 invest in the main front and after the basic completion, appropriately organize extra-grade labor to do a good job in preparing before going to work and cleaning up after work, to ensure that精兵 fight quickly and decisively, and rest on time; and to facilitate the timely transfer of the agricultural work center.

9.  "Three adjustments and three non-adjustments." For female commune members during menstruation, adjust dry work, not wet work; during pregnancy, adjust light work, not heavy work; during breastfeeding, adjust near work, not far work.

10. "Four adjustments and four non-adjustments." For extra-grade labor that can participate in light labor, adjust sunny days, not rainy days; adjust light work, not heavy work; in summer, adjust going to work early and late, not going to work at noon; in winter, adjust going to work at noon, not going to work early and late.

Chen Deyou not only paid attention to adjusting the labor rhythm of commune members in work allocation to ensure the realization of "double high", but also created a set of experiences in comprehensively doing a good job in combining labor and rest, to ensure that this team, since the Great Leap Forward, except for a few days during the busy season, basically achieved eight to ten hours of production per day, six to eight hours of eating, studying, and resting, and eight hours of sleep. At the same time, the canteen cooks ensure that the rice and vegetables are hot in winter; in summer, they are cooked early and cooled to just the right temperature; cooks send cold boiled water and Agastache rugosa tea to the fields to relieve heat; various diets pay special attention to cleanliness and hygiene. In summer, every ten days or half a month, organize commune members to clear weeds and sewage around the houses, eliminate mosquitoes and flies, and create a comfortable resting environment for commune members after strenuous labor. At the same time, change the monthly regular holiday system to a temporary leave system, allowing commune members to take leave in installments according to specific circumstances, under the principle that male commune members do not exceed two days per month and female commune members do not exceed four days. This practice not only does not affect production, but also takes care of the needs of commune members and gives full play to the role of holidays.

    把劳逸结合起来
    卫星管理区第二生产队使用劳力的调查报告（之二）
    中共武胜县委通讯组　本报记者
    在适时早种、尽量多种、争取粮食高产的声浪里，四川农村的夏收夏种和田间管理运动持续三个月之久，一直接上了秋季收、耕、种、管、藏五大农活。繁忙的农事活动，使人们创造了愉快和紧张的劳动生活。今年夏末秋初，我们在武胜县旧县公社卫星管理区第二生产队，亲眼看到社员们是怎样又乐又忙地进行工作，了解了这里“双高”（高质量高工效）运动深入健康发展的经验。
    这个队的副队长陈德友，是四川省劳动模范，1959年他完成的工作量相当于具有同等劳动力的人工作量的一年半到两年。生产队长陈远文，1959年只比陈德友少作几十个劳动日，是全县有名的“双高”标兵。干部作活是“双高”，社员作活也是“双高”。全队社员今年以来每人平均完成的工作量，比全社社员平均水平高出20％左右。
    秘密在哪里
    我们在这里访问中也发现，这个队各项农活开始以后，很快就有30％、50％、甚至70％的社员突破定额。突破定额以后，人们还各找对手，进行“双高”比赛。我们留心观察了一下，每当社员们达到打擂比武提出的“双高”指标时，如果再坚持一阵，本来还可以多做一点点活路，但也就在这个时候，队长、副队长总是坚决地督促大家回去休息。生产队长告诉我们：“在这个时候，让大家回去休息，虽然今天少超额一点点，但充分恢复体力之后，明天就可以更多更快更好地完成新的任务。”这句话提醒我们：这个队的工效所以这么高，秘密就在于劳逸结合。
    一道新题
    1958年春天，当这个小队卷入大跃进浪潮以后，全队社员表现了高度的忘我精神。正在这时，支部书记汪定昌找到共产党员陈德友，给他出了一道新题：“……现在，社员的生产热情越来越高，支部经过再三讨论，决定叫你创造一种既要劳动好，又要累不着的经验，你一定要想出办法来。”陈德友像历次接受党的任务一样，张口答应了一声“好！”但是，这个二十年前的放牛娃、十年前地主的长工！吃尽了旧社会苦头的人，在解放后，特别是在集体生产中，自己就经常想不到休息。每当别人劝他休息时，他就这样说：“解放前给地主干活时，从早到晚、从春到冬，只准牛休息，不准人歇气；现在，每天吃得饱、睡得好，而且月月放假，这还能够把我累着？”
    有一年雨夜的冬天，他冒雨巡视麦田时，忽然发现塘堰垮了一个缺口，激流直冲麦田。他毫不犹豫地跳下水里，用脊背堵住缺口，护救了小麦。如果让这样一个人，多完成一些生产任务，显然不算什么难题；如果叫这个周身沸腾着忘我革命热情的人，创造出既要劳动好、又要休息好的经验，无疑，对他是难作的“文章”。
    陈德友接到支部指示后，很快就摆起了擂台，先跟本队身强力壮技术好的青年人，举行高质量高工效比赛，他胜利了。紧接着又跟另一批青年人比赛，他再次获胜。第三天上午的比赛，刚开始不久，他却占了下风。管理区的支部书记汪定昌知道这种情况后，立即从其它生产队赶到这里，宣布竞赛至此告一段落。陈德友很着急，说：“难道‘双高’比赛只能搞两天？这怎么能够解决大跃进中缺少劳动力的困难？”“不，‘双高’比赛可以搞二十天、四十天、甚至更多的日子，可是要作到这一点，却不能像你这样搞……”汪定昌直截了当地作了回答。随后，他便启发陈德友回忆两天来的比赛经过，跟他一道，仔细分析了一个个的步骤，终于找出了原因：主要是陈德友在第一天达到打擂提出的指标之后，没有适可而止，为了贪图当天多作一点点农活，以至当夜不能很好恢复体力；第二天还是如此；第三天可就有困难了。经过这次分析，他们便总结出一套组织高工效比赛的经验：运动开展前，要千方百计地改革工具，并组织参加比赛的人学习掌握新工具；打擂比赛时，党小组和队委会要严格审查每个社员提出的指标，保证既先进可靠，又留有余地；比赛前，在生产、生活上作好一切准备工作，并委派党员、团员中的“双高”标兵，分别帮助自己的竞赛对手，检查每一估计、打算和操作方法是否正确、巧妙，认真帮助他们改进操作技术；一旦达到了打擂指标或限定时间，立即停止比赛，双方都达到指标便同时对双方给以政治荣誉与物质奖励……。这一套方法创造出来以后，对这个队的高工效运动健康地发展起了相当大的作用，也给了陈德友很大的教育和启发。
    十句口诀
    从那一次总结以后，陈德友时时在劳逸结合的问题上转脑筋。他不但设法使自己多作活和有劳有逸，而且把这些经验利用到日常调工中去，让更多的社员跟自己一样。他还设法调整像他这样壮年人的劳动节奏，观察、研究、调整男的女的、级外劳力的劳动节奏。他终于将劳逸结合的精神贯彻在日常调工之中，想出了相当多的好办法。这些办法归纳起来有十句口诀：
    一、“因人调农活”。重活不调弱劳力，避免力所不及；轻活不调强劳力，避免窝工。保证强弱劳力都能胜任所指派的农活，使每个人都容易恢复体力。
    二、“调新不调旧”。尽一切可能调人们学习使用新工具，不调使用旧工具。初用新工具时予以照顾，确保新工具发挥作用，以提高工效，减轻劳动强度。
    三、“适当变农活”。在可能情况下，使主要分担躬腰、手锄、肩挑等工作的社员，适当更换一下农活，这样既避免身体某一部分过于疲劳，又可提高工效。
    四、“调农兼调副”。按照农活忙闲，天气晴雨，劳力强弱，技术生熟等情况，在不影响田间生产的情况下，适当安排一些社员，在搞了一段突击任务之后，回家坐下来，利用短暂时间编制一些生产急需的竹木农具和搞些劳动强度较轻的副业生产。
    五、“调熟兼调生”。调工时尽可能做到师傅带徒弟，使生手逐步做到少费力，质量高，按时完成任务，及早休息。同时，通过这种办法，培养更多的多面手，以便根据他们的体力状况，改调其它农活，保证“调农兼调副”“适当变农活”等措施的实现。
    六、“进出不空手”。利用社员出工、收工时间，顺便带些肥料、饲料、燃料、蔬菜等，这样既可以减轻饲养员、炊事员的工作量，让他们也能劳逸结合；又可以避免运输任务堆的过多、农活打挤、拖长工作时间。
    七、“忙闲调匀称”。经常注意各项农活、各个工序之间的不平衡现象，适当组织临时性的互助支援，充分发挥团结友爱的精神，使彼此都不超过一定的劳动强度，以便社员容易恢复体力。
    八、“调好辅助工”。精兵投入主阵之前和基本完工之后，适当组织级外劳力作好出工前的准备和收工后的扫尾工作，保证精兵速战速决，按时休息；也便于及时转移农活中心。
    九、“三调三不调”。女社员月经期调干不调湿，怀孕期调轻不调重，哺乳期调近不调远。
    十、“四调四不调”。可以参加轻微劳动的级外劳力，晴调雨不调；调轻不调重；夏天调早晚出工不调中午出工；冬天调中午出工不调早晚出工。
    陈德友不但在调工中注意调整社员的劳动节奏，保证“双高”的实现，而且还创造了一套全面作好劳逸结合的经验，保证这个队自大跃进以来，除大忙期中少数日子外，基本上作到了每天生产八至十小时，吃饭、学习、休息六至八小时，睡眠八小时。同时，食堂做饭冬天保证饭热菜热；夏天煮得早，晾得不冷不热；由炊事员往田间送凉开水、霍香茶，消暑解热；各种饮食特别注意清洁卫生。夏天每隔十天、半月就组织社员清除房屋周围的杂草、污水，消灭蚊蝇，为社员紧张劳动之后创造一个舒适的休息环境。同时，把每月定期放假制度，改为临时请假制度，在男社员每月不超过两天，女社员不超过四天的原则下，根据具体情况，允许社员分次请假。这种作法既不影响生产，又能照顾社员的需要，充分发挥了假期的作用。
