Xinhua News Agency, September 29th: Premier Abbas's Speech at the Beijing Airport

Your Excellency:

Your welcome speech just now deeply moved me. I thank you from the bottom of my heart. While thanking you, I also express my gratitude and respect to the heroic Chinese people. The extraordinary courage and great enthusiasm of the Chinese people have set an inspiring example for so many enslaved people. You will understand the excitement we feel when we set foot on the great land of China. This is the land cultivated by people's hands for thousands of years, the land with glorious epics and fruitful labor; it is the land with excellent culture, where, after the despicable and panic-stricken imperialism suffered a defeat from which it can no longer recover, a new society has been established and is thriving.

Your Excellency,

At a time when the imperialists gathered within and around the North Atlantic Treaty Organization are again resorting to their usual tricks to secure their rule in the underdeveloped regions of the earth, the Algerian people fighting for freedom are pleased to have a powerful China among their many friends. The mission of the delegation of the Provisional Government of the Algerian Republic is to express to you the excited and warm feelings of the tormented Algerian people.

Whenever possible, we always want to participate in the grand festivals of the People's Republic of China. In addition, we must consolidate the inseparable ties between our two peoples from now on.

One month later, on November 1, 1960, the Algerian people will commemorate the sixth anniversary of the armed struggle against French imperialism. If the French imperialists had not received huge material and financial assistance from American imperialism and the NATO countries to prolong their lives, they would have certainly failed as early as 1957.

The Algerian people are invincible today and will be victorious tomorrow. Although one hundred and thirty years of colonial rule has weakened some of its material conditions, the Algerian people are resisting this new alliance. The Algerian people persevere in their struggle and continue to organize themselves. While fighting for their inevitable liberation, the Algerian people are also effectively supporting the liberation of the African continent, and are happy and proud of this.

This is a tenacious war, and France has turned it into an irreconcilable, racist war. In this war, Algeria bravely resists. All free people stand on the side of Algeria, and the great people of the People's Republic of China stand on the side of Algeria.

Mr. Prime Minister, this is why we consider it a sincere and noble mission to seize every opportunity to express our friendship and our respect to you.

We want to gain the strength of encouragement from your glorious people to continue to accomplish our major tasks. In our opinion, this alone is enough to explain why we came to visit China.

Our wishes do not stop there.

On behalf of the Provisional Government of the Algerian Republic and the Algerian people, we once again express our warm gratitude for the support of the People's Republic of China. At the same time, we also want to draw on your rich experience and strengthen this necessary solidarity in friendship and mutual trust.

In concluding this brief address, I would like to express the warm and infinite gratitude of the Algerian delegation for the warm and moving welcome you have given us. We know that this is a welcome, through us as individuals, to the Algerian people who are fighting for independence.

Long live the People's Republic of China!

Long live the friendship and solidarity between the Algerian and Chinese peoples!

### 阿巴斯总理在机场上的讲话

　　阿巴斯总理在机场上的讲话
    新华社29日讯　阿巴斯总理在北京机场的讲话阁下：
    你刚才的欢迎词使我深为感动。我衷心地感谢你。在感谢你的同时，我也向英勇的中国人民表示谢意和敬意。中国人民非凡的勇气和巨大的热情为如此之多的被奴役的人民树立了一个振奋人心的榜样。你会理解我们踏上伟大中国的土地时那种激动的心情的。这是数千年来由人们的双手所垦拓的土地，是有着光荣的史诗和富有成果的劳动的土地；是有着优秀文化的土地，在这块土地上，当可鄙的和惊惶失措的帝国主义，遭到了再也不能卷土重来的失败以后，一个新社会建立起来了，并且正在蒸蒸日上。
    阁下，
    正当集结在北大西洋公约组织内外的帝国主义者又在玩弄惯用的伎俩，来确保他们在地球上不发达地区的统治的时候，为自由而斗争的阿尔及利亚人民对于在他们许多朋友中有着强大的中国而感到高兴。阿尔及利亚共和国临时政府代表团的使命，是向你们表达受折磨的阿尔及利亚人民的激动和热烈的感情。
    只要有可能，我们总是要来参加中华人民共和国的盛大节日的，此外，我们还要巩固我们两国人民之间从此不可分离的联系。
    一个月以后，就是在1960年11月1日，阿尔及利亚人民将要纪念反对法帝国主义的武装斗争的六周年，如果没有美帝国主义和北大西洋公约组织国家在物质上和财政上给法帝国主义以巨大的援助来使它苟延残喘，法帝国主义本来早在1957年就肯定失败了。
    阿尔及利亚人民今天是不可战胜的，明天将是胜利者。虽然一百三十年的殖民主义统治削弱了它的某些物质条件，然而阿尔及利亚人民却抗击着这个新的联盟。阿尔及利亚人民坚持不懈地进行斗争，并且不断地组织起来。阿尔及利亚人民在争取自身必将到来的解放的同时，也有效地支援了非洲大陆的解放，并且为此感到高兴和自豪。
    这是一场顽强的战争，法国已使这场战争变为誓不两立的、种族主义的战争。在这场战争中，阿尔及利亚勇敢地进行抵抗。所有自由的人民都站在阿尔及利亚这一边，伟大的中华人民共和国人民站在阿尔及利亚这一边。
    总理先生，这就是为什么我们认为利用一切机会来向你们表达我们的友谊和我们的敬意，是一项至诚的崇高使命的原因。
    我们要在你们光荣的人民中间得到鼓舞的力量以继续完成我们的重大任务。在我们看来，仅仅这一点就足以说明我们为什么要来中国访问。
    我们的愿望还不止于此。
    我们以阿尔及利亚共和国临时政府和阿尔及利亚人民的名义对中华人民共和国的支援再次表示热情的感谢，同时，我们还要吸取你们丰富的经验，并且在友谊和相互信任中加强这种必要的团结。
    在结束这篇简短的致词的时候，我谨代表阿尔及利亚代表团对你们给予我们的热情的和令人感动的欢迎表示热烈的和无限的感谢。我们知道，这是通过我们个人对正在为独立而斗争的阿尔及利亚人民的欢迎。
    中华人民共和国万岁！
    阿尔及利亚人民和中国人民的友谊和团结万岁！
