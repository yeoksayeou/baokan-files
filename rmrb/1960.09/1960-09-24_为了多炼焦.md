　　To Produce More Coke
　　Jin Fu, Wen He
　　For the past few days, it has been difficult to spot Party Branch Secretary Li Shengfeng in the Party Branch office. He has been going back and forth between the kiln and the dormitory, discussing with the workers how to increase coke production using coal slime.
　　Yipinglang Coking Plant is responsible for supplying coke to Kunming Iron and Steel Company. How can we provide Kunming Iron and Steel with more "supplies" to ensure its production increases even more significantly? The Party Branch carefully studied this issue and finally concentrated the opinions of the masses, deciding to build a flat kiln to produce coke using coal slime, and put forward the call of "Tackle coal slime, build flat kilns, and increase coke production by two tons per person."
　　The method was good, the raw materials were available, and the labor force was not a problem. However, using coal slime to make coke was a new thing, and would it be successful? Some people still had a question mark in their minds. They were worried that the coal slime would not ignite.
　　After extensively soliciting the opinions of the masses, Li Shengfeng believed that using coal slime to make coke could be successful. He then decided to immediately build an experimental kiln to dispel doubts that coal slime could not be used to make coke.
　　As the east was just beginning to brighten, Li Shengfeng, along with Jiang Qigui, a cadre from the Party Branch office, and Li Wen, the chairman of the trade union, carried baskets, hoes, and shovels and began building the experimental kiln next to the coal washing trough's return water pool.
　　The strong desire to increase coke production filled Li Shengfeng and his partners with energy. Li Shengfeng and Jiang Qigui were digging the kiln pit and leveling the ground, while Li Wen carried the basket and picked up broken bricks from the ditch to build the fire channel. Then, the three of them busied themselves arranging the fire channel and transporting coal slime. As the clock pointed to twelve, the flat kiln had been built. This kiln was one and a half meters wide and three meters long, with four rows of fire channels. According to the coal loading capacity, it could produce more than six tons of coke each time, and the three of them could increase production for the country by an average of two tons of coke each.
　　"Is the kiln built correctly? Is the arrangement of the fire channels reasonable?" In order to make the kiln more likely to turn coal slime into coke, Li Shengfeng carefully sought the opinions of the masses. With the help of veteran workers, a large amount of coal slime was quickly loaded into the flat kiln. By sunset, a roaring fire had been lit in the kiln. Instantly, thick smoke rose, flying into the air like clouds. Watching the burning kiln, Li Shengfeng felt a weight lifted from his mind. Now, what he was thinking was: hundreds of flat kilns will be built quickly, thousands of tons of insignificant coal slime will be turned into valuable coke, and the plant's coke production will increase sharply....
　　The plant's broadcasting station began its third broadcast. The announcer spread the news of the Party Branch Secretary taking the lead in setting up an experimental kiln and launching the "Increase Coke Production by Two Tons per Person" campaign to every corner of the coking plant.
　　In an instant, crowds of people from all directions rushed to the experimental kiln.
　　"The Party Branch Secretary has taken the lead, we must act quickly!"
　　"I was worried that the coal slime wouldn't ignite! This time, we must make a big effort!"
　　The next day, all the employees of the plant began to take action. Coking workers, kiln loaders, transport workers, service personnel, and management cadres, in groups of three or five, were pulling coal, picking up bricks, digging pits, and measuring land on the hillside and by the road. When people were eating and walking, they were discussing how big their respective flat kilns were, how many tons of coal slime they had loaded, and when they would be out of the kiln....
　　Within a few days, a large chunk of the coal slime pile had been removed. The experimental kiln first successfully produced the first batch of coke. Then, dozens, hundreds of flat kilns successively produced coke. Trucks transporting coke lined up along the winding road, and one truck after another of coke was sent to the iron and steel production front.

　　为了多炼焦
　　金富　文和
    几天来，在党支部办公室里很难看到支部书记李盛丰的影子。他在窑边、在宿舍里串来串去，和工人共同商讨怎样利用煤泥增产焦炭。
    一平浪炼焦厂担负着供应昆明钢铁公司焦炭的任务。怎样供给昆钢更多的“粮草”，保证它的生产更大幅度增长呢？党支部仔细研究了这个问题，最后集中了群众的意见，决定建平窑，利用煤泥来炼焦，并且提出了“攻煤泥，建平窑，每人增产两吨焦”的号召。
    办法是不错，原料也有，劳动力也不成问题。但是，用煤泥炼焦是件新鲜事，能不能成功？有人在思想上还打着个问号。他们担心煤泥不能发火。
    李盛丰经过广泛征求群众意见，认定用煤泥炼焦可以成功。他便决定马上建一座试验窑，以便用事实来打破煤泥不能炼焦的疑虑。
    东方刚刚发白，李盛丰和党支部办公室的干部姜启贵、工会主席李文，便挑着箩筐，带着锄头、铁铲，在洗煤槽回水池旁边，动手修建试验窑了。
    增产焦炭的强烈愿望，使李盛丰和他的伙伴们浑身是劲。李盛丰、姜启贵在挖窑坑，平场地，李文挑起箩筐，从箐沟里拣来了搭火路用的碎砖头。然后，三个人又忙着摆火路，运煤泥。时针指向十二点钟，平地窑已经建好了。这座窑宽一米五，长三米，安置了四排火路。按照装煤量计算，每次可以炼六吨多焦，他们三个人平均每人可以为国家增产两吨焦。
      “这窑子修得对不对？火路安排得合理不合理？”为了使这座窑能够更有把握地把煤泥变成焦炭，李盛丰细心地征求了群众的意见。在老工人们的帮助下，平地窑很快就装好了大量煤泥。到日落时，窑里便燃起了熊熊烈火。顿时，浓烟袅袅上升，像云雾一样飞向半空。李盛丰眼看着烧得很旺的窑子，几天来悬在心上的一块石头落下来了。现在，他想的是：几百座平地窑将迅速修建起来，成千吨价值不大的煤泥将变成可贵的焦炭，全厂的焦炭产量将会猛然上升……。
    厂里的广播站开始了第三次播音。广播员把党支部书记带头搞试验窑、投入“每人增产两吨焦”运动的消息，传播到炼焦厂的各个角落。
    刹时间，四面八方的人群奔向试验窑。
    “支部书记带头干起来了，咱们要赶快动手啊！”
    “我原来还担心煤泥不会发火呢！这一回非大干一下不可！”
    第二天，全厂职工都开始行动起来。炼焦工人、装窑工人、运输工人、勤务人员、管理干部，三人一群，五人一伙，在山坡上、公路旁拉煤，拣砖，挖坑，量地。人们在吃饭、走路的时候，都议论着各自的平地窑有多大，装了多少吨煤泥，什么时候出窑……。
    几天之内，煤泥堆削去一大块。试验窑首先顺利地生产出第一批焦炭。接着，几十座、上百座的平地窑陆续出焦了。运焦的卡车沿着曲折的公路列队而下，一车车的焦炭被送往钢铁生产前线。
