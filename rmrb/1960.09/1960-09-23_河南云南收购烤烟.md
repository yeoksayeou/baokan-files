Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou Telegram: In Henan Province, the early tobacco's upper and lower leaves are generally mature, and the lower leaves of the late tobacco have also begun to be harvested and baked. It is now the peak season for large-scale harvesting and marketing. People's communes in various tobacco-producing areas have properly arranged labor. In addition to organizing professional teams for regular harvesting and curing, they also organize more manpower for rush harvesting and curing at appropriate times. Xuchang Prefecture seized the opportunity of the rain in the first ten days of the month and organized labor to rush to tie tobacco bundles whenever possible, increasing the daily amount of tobacco tying by two times.

Before the arrival of the peak season for flue-cured tobacco on the market, commercial departments throughout the province generally strengthened their purchasing power, improved purchasing methods, and accelerated the purchasing progress.

Xinhua News Agency, Kunming Telegram: Communes in tobacco-producing areas of Yunnan Province are rushing to harvest and bake tobacco leaves and are enthusiastically selling them. By the end of August, about half of the new tobacco baked throughout the province had been sold to the state. Although Yunnan Province's tobacco production this year has been continuously affected by natural disasters such as spring drought, pests and diseases, and floods, thanks to the strong leadership of the Party, the people's communes have exerted unparalleled power and overcome the disasters. Now, the tobacco leaves in the producing areas are growing well and have generally entered the stage of large-scale baking. Many people's communes have proposed "high yield and bumper harvest, not losing a single leaf, selling more and better flue-cured tobacco, and supporting national industrial construction," and are organizing the masses to bake and sell in a timely manner.

According to the characteristics of this year's early baking season, large purchasing volume, and concentrated time, commercial departments in various places have promptly organized forces to carry out material supply and flue-cured tobacco purchasing work. Yuxi County, the main tobacco-producing area, has set up 120 fixed purchasing points and goes deep into the communes to contract purchasing by district.

    据新华社郑州电　河南省的早烟上下叶片普遍生长成熟，晚烟下部叶片也已开始收摘、烘烤，目前正是大量收摘上市的旺季。各产烟区人民公社都妥善安排劳力，除了组织专业队经常收烤以外，还在适当时机组织更多人力突击收烤。许昌专区抓住上旬下雨的时机，见缝插针，组织劳力突击扎烟把，使每日扎烟量增加了二倍。
    在烤烟上市旺季到来之前，全省商业部门普遍加强了收购力量，改进了收购方法，加快了收购进度。
    据新华社昆明电　云南省各产烟地区的公社正在突击采摘烘烤烟叶，踊跃出售。到8月底止，全省各地烤出的新烟，已有一半左右出售给国家。云南省今年的烟叶生产虽然连续遭到春旱和病虫害、水涝等自然灾害，但是，由于党的坚强领导，人民公社发挥了无比威力，战胜了灾害。现在，产烟区烟叶生长很好，普遍进入大量烘烤阶段，许多人民公社提出“丰产丰收，片叶不丢，出售又多又好的烤烟，支援国家工业建设”，组织群众及时烘烤、出售。
    各地商业部门根据今年烘烤季节提前、收购量大、时间集中的特点，及时组织力量，开展物资供应和烤烟收购工作。主产烟区玉溪县，已设置固定收购点一百二十个，深入公社分片包干收购。
