For Our Common Cause

    Floating Repair Shop on the Water
    At dawn, the sky is ablaze with morning clouds. A small steamer towing a wooden boat slowly advances against the rising waves of the Huangpu River.
    This boat, named "Nongshang Xiezuo No. 1" (Agriculture-Commerce Cooperation No. 1), is a special vessel prepared by the Shanghai commercial department to serve agriculture. From the outside, it looks no different from ordinary passenger and cargo steamers, except that it is equipped with equipment and accessories for repairing various agricultural implements, like a small agricultural implement repair factory.
    On this day, "Nongshang Xiezuo No. 1" set sail for the first time to the Nicheng People's Commune in Nanhui County. As the boat approached Datuan Town in Nanhui County, a wooden boat was rowed towards them. From the boat, someone shouted loudly from afar: "Comrades, is that the repair boat from Shanghai? Please stop for a moment." As the two boats approached, they saw a diesel engine in the wooden boat. It turned out that they were from the Dongcun Production Team of the Datuan People's Commune and were preparing to transport the diesel engine to the city for repairs. When passing through Datuan Town, they heard that a repair boat from Shanghai was passing by, so they stopped it for help.
    The technicians on the boat, not caring that the machine casing was scorching hot from the sun, started dismantling and repairing it. In just half an hour, the diesel engine was running again.
    The news of the repair boat going to the countryside spread like a spring breeze throughout the entire Nicheng People's Commune. At four o'clock in the afternoon, when "Nongshang Xiezuo No. 1" arrived, many farmers were already waiting here with their broken diesel engines, ready to "see the doctor". The technicians on the boat did not rest for a moment and immediately took their tools and worked with the farmers to dismantle the machines and check for problems. One diesel engine had a leaking cylinder. They took a new copper gasket from the big boat and fitted it to the cylinder. By the time it was repaired and installed, the sun was almost setting. The farmers tested it on the spot. As soon as the machine started, a stream of water spurted out of the water pump's pipeline. The farmers were very happy. It only cost the farmers 5.20 yuan to repair this diesel engine.
    "Nongshang Xiezuo No. 1" stayed in the Nicheng People's Commune of Nanhui County for fourteen days, repairing a total of seventeen diesel engines and water pumps. On the way back, the technicians stood on the boat and looked out at the two banks. In the vast fields, a gust of wind blew, and the thriving late rice rippled like waves. The sound of diesel engines pumping water could be faintly heard in the distance, as if playing a triumphal song for them. (Shi Tao) (Attached photo)

    水上流动修理厂
    拂晓，朝霞漫天。一艘小汽轮拖只木船，迎着黄浦江起伏的波涛缓缓前进。
    这只船名叫“农商协作一号”，是上海市商业部门为农业服务特备的船只。从外表看，它跟普通载客载货的汽轮没有什么两样，只是船上装的是修理各种农业机具的设备和配件，宛如一个小型的农具修理工厂。
    这天，“农商协作一号”第一次起航到南汇县泥城人民公社去。当船刚驶近南汇县大团镇的时候，迎面摇来一只木船。只听船上有人远远地高声叫道：“同志，上海来的修理船吗？请停一停。”两船靠近后，才看见木船里还有一台柴油机，原来他们是大团人民公社董村生产队的，准备把柴油机运到市区去修理。过大团镇时，听说上海有艘修理船经过这里，所以拦路求援。
    船上的技工们顾不得机器外壳被烈日晒得灼手，就拆拆弄弄修了起来。仅仅半个小时，这台柴油机又重新转动了。
    修理船下乡的消息，像春风似地传遍了整个泥城人民公社。下午四点钟，当“农商协作一号”到达的时候，许多农民早已带着坏了的柴油机在这里“候诊”了。船上的技工们一刻也不肯休息，马上带了工具，同农民一起动手拆开机器，检查毛病。有一台柴油机的汽缸漏气。他们从大船上拿来一个新的铜垫圈，配在汽缸上。等到修好、装好，太阳已经快下山了。农民当场试验，机器一发动，一股水柱顿时从水泵的管道里喷了出来。农民们非常高兴。修好这台柴油机，农民只花了五元二角钱。
    “农商协作一号”在南汇县泥城人民公社停了十四天，共修好了十七台柴油机、水泵。返航途中，技工们站在船上向两岸眺望。广阔的田野里，一阵风吹过，茁壮的晚稻泛起滚滚波浪。远处隐约传来柴油机抽水的声音，仿佛在为他们奏捷唱凯歌。　（世涛）（附图片）
