　　Old Eighth Route Army Style

　　Xiong Zhulin, the Party General Branch Secretary of the Xiong Yao Brigade in the Li Kou Commune of Shangqiu City, Henan Province, has maintained a fine tradition of hard work and plain living for more than ten years since he started working. He eats, lives, and dresses the same as ordinary peasants. The commune members call him "Old Eighth Route Army style."

　　For several years, he has traveled back and forth seventy or eighty miles from Xiong Yao to Shangqiu for meetings, never hiring a car or animal. He always walks, saving on travel expenses. Under his influence, frugality has become the prevailing atmosphere among all the cadres. The two bicycles in the brigade were bought during the primary cooperative era and are so old they have no "teeth" left. However, they still repair and use them as best they can. Since 1958, the Xiong Yao Brigade has not added any furniture except for three desks and chairs, eight small chairs, and fourteen small beds made from old wood.

　　The brigade's Party General Branch also adheres to the principle of "spending money where it counts" on production expenses, spending less and accomplishing more. They spend what needs to be spent and not a penny more. When the brigade proposed preparing for drought resistance in February of this year, each team asked to buy more waterwheels. The reported total was sixty-three. Calculating at one hundred and forty yuan per unit, this would cost more than eight thousand eight hundred yuan. For this reason, Xiong Zhulin went to the Chang Zhuang Production Team to understand the situation. This team originally had eight waterwheels, five of which could still be used, and the other three were just missing parts. After investigating this situation, he organized the iron and woodworking team to go down to the well and mobilized the masses to contribute spare parts they had saved. In three days and nights, they repaired all twenty-eight waterwheels in the brigade that were unusable due to missing parts, and put them all into the drought resistance campaign.

　　A Good Housekeeper in the Mess Hall

　　The soldiers of the reconnaissance company often praise their good meals, calling their mess hall a "high-class cafeteria." This is inseparable from the efforts of their quartermaster, Liu Zhaoqin, a Communist Party member from a poor peasant background.

　　Quartermaster Liu Zhaoqin has a heart that always seeks to save for the country and serve the soldiers in everything he does. Improving meals while saving money is the starting point for all his work. Take burning coal, for example. He often thought: "Burning" is something that cannot be directly eaten by the soldiers, but this expense accounts for a considerable amount of money each month. He often focused on this expense. This year, the reconnaissance company's station was very close to the coal station, but one ton of coal cost seventeen yuan. Later, he learned that burning slag (secondary coal after coking) was cheaper, costing only three yuan per ton. Liu Zhaoqin spent a day contacting the coking plant that sold slag, traveling more than sixty miles. From then on, they hauled slag back every month to burn.

　　Liu Zhaoqin also takes good care of the other "housekeeping" matters of the company. If a soldier's clothes are torn, he always educates everyone to mend them and wear them again in time. If new soldiers don't know how to mend, he organizes older soldiers to help. If the soldiers' shoes are broken, he collects them and sends them to the shoe repair group for repair. Because he manages these small things well, the entire company turns in 100% of their old items every year.

　　A Frugal Expert in the Art Troupe

　　A new play is about to be staged tomorrow, but two small palace lanterns are missing. The head of the Zhao Ge Zhuang Mine amateur Peking Opera troupe was very anxious. He hurried to the backstage of the rehearsal hall to find Zhang Ziyuan, the head of the costume and prop storage group, to find a solution.

　　Zhang Ziyuan immediately replied, "Don't worry, head! I guarantee we won't miss the performance."

　　The next morning, when several actors went to the backstage, they saw a pair of exquisite palace lanterns already placed on the table. It turned out that after the actors went home from rehearsal last night, Zhang Ziyuan stayed behind and carefully made these two small palace lanterns according to the appearance of the large palace lanterns.

　　Zhang Ziyuan is a worker in the tool room of the supply department of Zhao Ge Zhuang Mine and is an old activist in the club, specializing in the costumes and props for ancient dramas. He has always maintained a style of hard work, plain living, diligence, and thrift.

　　Restoring old items to look like new is very common for Zhang Ziyuan. The colorful robes in the box are the most valuable items among the opera costumes, and the old manager especially cherishes this part of the clothing. If the collar is broken, he will tear off a few feet of white satin to replace it; if one or two gold or silver threads fall off the robe, he will immediately sew them back on. In this way, those costumes that have been used for many years are still so brilliant and dazzling. (Attached picture)

### 勤俭成风

    勤俭成风
    老八路作风
    河南省商丘市李口公社熊窑大队党总支书记熊珠林，参加工作十多年以来，始终保持着艰苦朴素的优良作风。吃的、住的、穿的和普通农民一模一样。社员们称他为“老八路作风”。
    数年来，他从熊窑到商丘开会，来回七八十里，从未雇过车子、牲口，都是步行往返，节省出差开支。在他的影响下，勤俭办社成为全体干部的风气。现在大队的两辆自行车还是初级社时买的，已经老得没有“牙”了。但是，他们还是修修补补将就使用。熊窑大队从1958年以来，除用旧木料做了三副桌椅、八张小椅、十四张小床以外，没有添置任何家具。
    大队党总支在生产性开支上，也是本着“把钱用在刀刃上”，花钱少，办事多的原则，该花的花，不该花的一文不花。今年2月在提出作好抗旱准备工作时，各队纷纷要求多买水车。大家报的结果，共计是六十三部。算一算：每部以一百四十元计算，就得八千八百多元。为这，熊珠林深入到常庄生产队了解情况，这个队原有八部水车，五部还可以使用，其它三部只是缺少零件。摸到这些情况以后，他采取组织铁木业组下队到井，发动群众献出保存的零件的办法，把全大队因为缺零件不能用的二十八部水车，三天三夜全部修好了，全部投入了抗旱运动。
    食堂的好管家
    侦察连的战士们，常常对人夸奖他们的伙食好，称他们的伙房是“高级食堂”。这是与贫农出身的司务长、共产党员刘朝钦的努力分不开的。
    刘朝钦司务长有一颗处处为国家节约、事事为战士服务的心。既要改善伙食，又要节省，这是他做一切工作的出发点。就拿烧煤来说，他常想：“烧”这一项是不能直接吃到战士肚子里去的东西，可是这一项开支每月都要占相当的一笔款项。他常在这项开支上打主意，今年侦察连驻地离煤站很近，但一吨煤要花十七元。后来打听到烧水碴（炼焦后的次煤）便宜，一吨只花三元钱。刘朝钦用了一天的时间，联系了好几次，跑了六十多里路，才找到了出售水碴的炼焦厂。从这以后，他们每月拉水碴回来烧。
    对于连的其它“家务”事，刘朝钦也料理得很好。战士的衣服破了，他总是教育大家及时补上再穿。新战士不会补，他就组织老战士帮助。战士们的鞋破了，他就集中起来送给鞋工组修理。由于他对这些小事管得好，全连每年交旧都是百分之百。
    文工团的勤俭能手
    一场新剧明天就要上演了，只差两只小宫灯。赵各庄矿业余京剧团团长心里挺着急，他急急忙忙赶到排演场后台，找服装道具保管组组长张子辕想办法。
    张子辕立刻回答道：“团长，你放心吧！保证误不了场。”
    第二天一清早，几个演员跑到后台一看，一对小巧玲珑的宫灯已经放在桌上。原来，昨夜排戏的演员回家去以后，张子辕留下来，按照大宫灯的样子，精心赶制了这两个小宫灯。
    张子辕是赵各庄矿供应科工具室的工人，是俱乐部的老积极分子，专管古装戏的服装和道具。他一向保持着艰苦朴素克勤克俭的作风。
    整旧如新，对张子辕来说，已经是很平常的事了。箱子里那些五光十色的蟒袍，是戏装中最贵重的东西，老管家对这部分服装特别珍爱。领口坏了，扯上几尺白缎子给换一条；袍上的金线银线掉了一两根，他马上缀补好。就这样，那些已经用了多年的戏装，现在一件件都还是那么灿烂夺目。（附图片）
