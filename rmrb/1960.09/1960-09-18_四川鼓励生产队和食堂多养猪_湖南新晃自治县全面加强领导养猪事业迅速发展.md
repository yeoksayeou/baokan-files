Chengdu, September 17th (By our own correspondent) - Sichuan Province is taking various measures to help production teams and public canteens raise more pigs and raise them well.

　　Advocating and helping production teams and canteens raise more pigs is one of the important measures taken by Sichuan Province to accelerate the development of hog raising. Experiences everywhere have repeatedly proved that units that earnestly implement this policy develop pig raising much faster than average. Cadres and masses have summarized many benefits of raising pigs by small teams and canteens: (1) Production teams and canteens are numerous and widely distributed, with great potential for raising pigs; (2) Fertilizer transportation is convenient, which can promote a closer combination of pig raising and agriculture; (3) Canteens can utilize leftover fire, swill, vegetable scraps, etc.; (4) More pigs mean more fertilizer and more income, which can better arrange the lives of commune members; (5) Promote production teams to strengthen leadership in pig raising; (6) Promote communes and management areas to better self-breed, so that pig raising at all levels can develop greatly.

　　In recent months, Sichuan has fully utilized and developed the experience of helping production teams and canteens raise pigs, and has taken many measures in terms of feed, pig sources, and funds. In terms of feed, the state, communes, and management areas allocate sufficient feed grain to production teams in a timely manner based on the number of heads and fixed quotas, and implement it down to the team and field; at the same time, all crop straws are handed over to the production teams for processing into feed. Since the summer harvest, according to incomplete statistics from eight special districts including Da County and Wan County, more than 150 million catties of feed grain have been retained. All production teams and canteens with fewer or no pigs are regarded as key targets for support. Many communes and management areas have extracted a considerable portion of piglets from their own raised pigs and supported them at a discounted price. Banks in various places have also issued a large number of pig raising loans to them. In recent months, Yongchuan County has issued more than 200,000 yuan in loans to teams with fewer pigs throughout the county, helping these teams repair more than 2,000 pigsties and purchase more than 4,000 piglets.

　　Under the leadership and help of the state and communes, the vast number of production teams and canteens in the province are full of energy. Artificial insemination, which was not very popular in the past, has quickly formed a mass movement since the beginning of summer. The production teams vigorously carried out an increase planting campaign, built small chlorella pools extensively, and opened up feed sources in many ways.

Changsha, September 17th (By our own correspondent) - Xinhuang Dong Autonomous County, Hunan Province, which is famous throughout the country for its hog raising production, is inspired by the call of the Provincial Party Committee to further mobilize the whole party and the whole people to advance victoriously and resolutely seize a good harvest year, and is full of confidence to make hog raising production even better.

　　At the beginning of this year, the Xinhuang County Party Committee, based on the county's favorable conditions, put forward the requirement of sustained development of hog raising production, which was warmly supported by the vast number of cadres and masses. All parts of the county further implemented the "five specializations" management method of full-time leadership, specialized institutions, specialized teams, dedicated feed land, and dedicated feed grain, and strengthened leadership at all levels. The County Party Committee also put forward different requirements to the four communes with a poor foundation, such as "quantity-oriented, with equal emphasis on quantity and quality," and to the four communes with a good foundation, such as "quality-oriented, with equal emphasis on quality and quantity," and implemented the indicators down to the team, field, and group. At the same time, all localities resolutely implemented the policy of "public raising as the mainstay, private raising as a supplement, and simultaneous development of public and private raising," and gave play to the enthusiasm of pig raising at all levels. Currently, among the more than 330,000 pigs in the county, state-owned farms, forestry farms, and livestock farms account for 0.13%, commune pig farms account for 1.8%, brigade pig farms account for 90%, canteens account for 4.52%, institutions, schools, and enterprises account for 1.1%, and private individuals account for 2.45%. In developing brigade pig raising, the method of unified management by the brigade, centralized leadership, and separate field raising was implemented, and medium-sized and small-sized field pig farms were generally established in production teams.

　　With the increase in the number of pigs, solving the feed problem is a major issue. The Xinhuang County Party Committee allocated 2.5 million catties of refined feed on the one hand, and on the other hand, promptly organized a thousand-member inspection team to go deep into the pig farms to help formulate a refined feed distribution and management system. The amount of feed was calculated down to the field, pen, and pig, and fed on time and quantitatively. They also helped breeders learn the technology of cultivating chlorella and making aureomycin, and summarized the experience of planting green fodder. All parts of the county adopted methods such as reclaiming wasteland, utilizing water surfaces, open spaces, and intercropping and relay cropping to plant more than 64,000 mu of feed, and also utilized more than 200 kinds of wild feed to meet the needs of the continuous increase in pig raising production for feed.

　　Raising sows well and improving the farrowing rate and survival rate of piglets are key issues for continuously developing hog production. All communes firmly grasped effective measures such as "double fullness" (sows are full of pregnancy and full of fat) and "five completeness" (mating, accuracy, birth, survival, and strong) to improve the farrowing rate. More than 11,000 breeders in the county have generally learned techniques such as mating, protecting the fetus, raising piglets, and epidemic prevention. After vigorously grasping the "double fullness" and "five completeness" campaign, 97.7% of sows of breeding age were mated, and the survival rate of piglets reached 95%, ensuring the rapid development of hogs.

　　In order to further improve operation and management and give play to the enthusiasm of breeders, a relatively complete "three guarantees and eight fixations" responsibility system was also promoted in various places. The brigade guarantees the production team pig farm's output, work points, and costs. The pig farm implements "eight fixations" (quantity, quality, time, work points, pigsty, feed, fertilizer, rewards and punishments) for the breeders. These systems first mobilize the masses to discuss, so that every breeder clearly understands their responsibilities, has plans for their work, has goals for their struggle, and has standards for inspection and evaluation, and everyone strives to raise more pigs and do more work.

　　Through competitions, high-efficiency and high-quality pig raising red banner hands and red banner units continue to emerge. The county has selected 350 model breeders and 96 red banner units of various types. (Attached picture)

    四川鼓励生产队和食堂多养猪
    湖南新晃自治县全面加强领导养猪事业迅速发展
    本报成都17日电　四川省各地多方面采取措施，帮助生产队和公共食堂多养猪、养好猪。
    提倡和帮助生产队和食堂多养猪，是四川省加快发展养猪事业的重要措施之一。各地经验一再证明：凡是认真贯彻这一方针的单位，猪只发展大大超过一般速度。干部群众总结出小队和食堂养猪的好处很多：（一）生产队和食堂数量多，分布广，养猪潜力巨大；（二）肥料运送近便，能促进养猪更密切地和农业结合；（三）能利用食堂余火、泔水、菜脚叶等；（四）猪多肥多收入多，能更好地安排社员生活；（五）推动生产队加强养猪领导；（六）促进公社和管理区更好地自繁自养，使各级养猪大发展。
    最近几个月来，四川各地充分运用和发展了帮助生产队和食堂养猪的经验，从饲料、猪源、资金等各方面采取了许多措施。在饲料方面，国家、公社和管理区在分配中按头数、按定量及时拨给生产队足够的饲料粮，并落实到队到场；同时，农作物秸秆全部交给生产队，加工作饲料。夏收以来，据达县、万县等八个专区的不完全统计，已提留饲料粮一亿五千多万斤。各地对养猪少或没有养猪的生产队和食堂，都做为扶植的重点。许多公社和管理区从自己饲养的猪只中抽出相当大一部分仔猪折价支援他们饲养。各地银行也向他们发放了大批养猪贷款。永川县最近几个月向全县养猪少的队发放贷款二十多万元，帮助了这些队整修了两千多猪圈，添购了四千多头仔猪。
    在国家、公社的领导和帮助下，全省广大生产队和食堂干劲十足，过去推广还不十分普遍的人工授精，入夏以来很快形成了群众运动。各生产队大力开展了增种运动，广建小球藻池，多方开辟饲料来源。
    本报长沙17日电　以养猪生产闻名全国的湖南省新晃侗族自治县，在省委关于进一步动员全党全民乘胜前进，坚决夺取好年成的号召鼓舞下，满怀信心要把养猪生产搞得更好。
    今年年初，新晃县委就根据本县的有利条件，提出了持续发展养猪生产的要求，广大干部和群众热烈拥护。全县各地进一步贯彻执行了专职领导、专业机构、专业队伍、专用饲料地、专用饲料粮的“五专”管理办法，层层加强领导。县委还向基础较差的四个公社提出“数量为主，数量、质量并重”；向基础较好的四个公社提出“质量为主，质量、数量并重”等不同要求，并将指标落实到队到场到组。与此同时，各地坚决贯彻执行“公养为主，私养为辅，公养私养并举”的两条腿走路的方针，发挥了各级养猪的积极性。目前全县存栏的三十三万多头猪中，国营农、林、牧场占0.13％，公社猪场占1.8％，大队猪场占90％，食堂占4.52％，机关、学校、企业占1.1％，私人占2.45％。在发展大队养猪时，实行大队统一经营、集中领导、分场饲养的办法，普遍在生产队建立了中、小型的田间养猪场。
    随着生猪数量的增加，解决饲料问题是个很大的事情。新晃县委一方面拨下精饲料二百五十万斤，另一方面及时组织千人检查团，深入养猪场，帮助制订精饲料发放管理制度，饲料数量都计算到场到栏到猪，按时定量喂养。又帮助饲养员学习培育小球藻和制金霉素的技术，总结种植青饲料的经验。全县各地采取开荒，利用水面、空坪隙地和复种、套种等办法，种植饲料六万四千多亩，还利用野生饲料二百多种，满足了养猪生产不断上升对饲料的需要。
    养好母猪，提高产仔率和仔猪成活率，是不断发展生猪生产的关键问题。各公社都狠狠抓住“双满”（母猪满怀、满膘）、“五全”（配、准、生、活、壮）等有效措施，提高产仔率。全县一万一千多名饲养员，一般都学会了配种、保胎育仔、防疫等技术。经过大抓“双满”、“五全”运动后，适龄母猪97.7％配上了种，仔猪成活率达95％，保证了生猪迅速发展。
    为了进一步搞好经营管理，发挥饲养人员的积极性，各地还推行了一套比较完善的“三包、八定”责任制度。大队对生产队养猪场包产量、包工分、包成本。养猪场对饲养人员实行“八定”（数量、质量、时间、工分、猪栏、饲料、肥料、奖罚）。这些制度事先发动群众讨论，使饲养员人人明确责任，工作有盘算，奋斗有目标，检查评比有标准，个个争取多养猪、多做事。
    通过竞赛，高工效、高质量的养猪红旗手、红旗单位不断涌现，全县评选出模范饲养员三百五十人，各类型红旗单位九十六个。（附图片）
