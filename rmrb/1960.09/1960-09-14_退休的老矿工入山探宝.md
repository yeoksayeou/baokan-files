    Retired Old Miner Enters Mountains to Seek Treasure

    In the city of Baia Mare in northwestern Romania, lives a sixty-eight-year-old retired miner who has been retired for four years.

    This is an elderly person who can't stay idle. Whenever someone visits him, they often receive the reply: "Grandpa Rupsa is not at home. He spends all day in the forests outside the city, leaving in the morning and returning only in the evening."

    Baia Mare is a beautiful city surrounded by mountains, with vast forests and rich mineral deposits around it. Rupsa worked here as a miner since he was young, and spent a total of forty years underground in the mines when he retired in 1957. Before liberation, Rupsa, like other miners, lived a life of slavery. After liberation, Rupsa's life became increasingly happy.

    In 1957, he retired. At the time, he thought: "Although I am retired, I should still do more work for the country." The day after he retired and returned home, he took a hoe and hammer and went to the nearby mountains to look for underground wealth.

    Rupsa was born on the edge of the forest and grew up with the small trees in the forest. He is very familiar with every piece of land, every hill, every river, and every steep cliff here. Forty years of mining life have allowed him to accumulate a lot of practical geological knowledge. All this is of great use for finding minerals.

    However, Rupsa is already old after all. Moreover, shortly after his retirement, he suffered from thrombosis in his left leg. After the doctor performed surgery, although his foot was not amputated, his leg was somewhat lame. However, these difficulties cannot stop Rupsa's ambition and efforts to explore the treasures of the motherland. For more than four years, he has often dragged his slightly lame left leg, working hard up and down the mountains, searching for minerals everywhere in the forest.

    Rupsa's hard work has already created outstanding results. He and his second son, as well as three or four other people, have mined more than one hundred tons of barium titanate ore and sent it to the chemical factory in the city. The test results are of good quality, and the factory needs this mineral very much. He also discovered clay and lignite in the forest. According to chemists' tests, this clay is of good quality and can be used as molding clay for steelmaking, can be used to make pottery, and can also be used to make refractory bricks.

    Rupsa's work has received strong support and assistance from the local Party and government. He made a suggestion to the government to open mines in the places where he discovered mineral deposits, and the government sent experts to explore with him. The local government also invited him to talk and listen to his valuable suggestions on mining and using these resources to develop industry. Under the care and encouragement of the Party and the government, his confidence is even stronger. He said: "As long as I am in good health, I will definitely contribute my strength to the socialist industrial construction of the motherland." (Mei)

### 退休的老矿工入山探宝

    退休的老矿工入山探宝
    在罗马尼亚西北部的巴雅马勒城中，住着一位退休已经四年的六十八岁的老矿工。
    这是一位闲不住的老年人。每当有人登门拜访他的时候，时常会得到这样的回答：“鲁普萨爷爷不在家。他整天都在城外森林中，早晨走，晚上才能回来。”
    巴雅马勒城是一个群山环绕的美丽城市，在它的周围，有着广阔的森林和丰富的矿藏。鲁普萨从年轻时起就在这里当矿工，到1957年退休时在矿井下一共干了四十年。解放前，鲁普萨和其他矿工一样，过着奴隶般的生活。解放后，鲁普萨生活越来越幸福。
    1957年，他退休了。当时他想：“我虽然退休了，还是应该为国家做更多的工作。”退休回家的第二天，他就带了镢头和锤子到附近山中去寻找地下财富了。
    鲁普萨是在森林边诞生的，也是和林中的小树一起长大的。他对这里的每块土地、每个山丘，每条河流、每个陡崖都非常熟悉。四十年来的矿工生活，使他积累了很多实际的地质学知识。这一切，对找矿工作都有很大用处。
    但是，鲁普萨毕竟已经上了年纪。而且，退休后不久，他左腿患了血栓病，经医生动手术后，脚虽然没有锯掉，腿却有些跛了。然而，这些困难阻挡不了鲁普萨探寻祖国宝藏的雄心和努力。四年多来，他经常是拖着他那条微跛的左腿，辛勤地上山下坡，在森林里到处找矿。
    鲁普萨的辛勤劳动，已经创造了出色的成果。他和第二个儿子以及另外三、四个人，已经采出了一百多吨矽酸钡钛矿，送给城里化学工厂，化验结果质量很好，该厂很需要这种矿物。他还在森林中发现了陶土和褐煤。经化学家化验，这种陶土质量很好，可以做炼钢所需的模型土，可以制陶器，还可以造耐火砖。
    鲁普萨的工作，得到了当地党和政府的大力支持和帮助。他向政府提出建议，要在他发现矿藏的地方开矿，政府就派了专家同他去勘探。当地政府还请他去谈话，听取他对于开采矿藏和利用这些资源发展工业的宝贵建议。在党和政府的关怀和鼓舞下，他的信心更足了。他说：“只要我身体好，我就一定要在祖国社会主义工业建设中贡献自己的力量。”（梅）（附图片）
