"Sanqiu" (Three Autumns: autumn harvest, autumn planting, autumn plowing) is the busiest and most labor-intensive season of the year for agricultural work. To do a good job in all aspects of autumn harvesting, autumn planting, and autumn plowing, on the one hand, we should give full play to the strength of the labor army that is working hard on the agricultural front, and on the other hand, we should quickly mobilize all the labor force within commune enterprises and institutions that can be transferred to the front line of field production. Tapping the labor potential from within the rural people's communes is the fastest and most effective measure to strengthen the front line of field production.

With the comprehensive leap forward in agricultural production and rural work, it is necessary to transfer some labor from the front line of field production to the commune's industrial enterprises, welfare undertakings, and other "logistics" departments. Without this labor force, the great cause of building a new socialist countryside would not be able to develop in an all-round way. However, some departments have called for more labor than necessary due to lack of experience; some personnel have completed the task of establishing commune enterprises and institutions and can now leave these departments; some enterprises and institutions have launched technical innovation and technical revolution movements and have the potential to save some labor. Under such circumstances, these labors should be transferred without hesitation and immediately arranged to the front line of field production. The Gushi Commune in Weinan County, Shaanxi Province, transferred 1.35% of its management personnel, i.e., more than 580 people, and 7% of its living welfare and health personnel, i.e., more than 3,000 people, to strengthen the agricultural front, so that the labor force in the front line increased from 59.2% of the total labor force to 80%. Jianxing Commune in Nanbu County, Sichuan Province, rectified the commune-run enterprises and institutions, and transferred more than 1,500 laborers (accounting for 21.4% of the total labor force of the commune) to strengthen the production front line. These are two relatively prominent typical examples, and the labor allocation of other communes may not be exactly the same. However, it can be affirmed that no matter which commune, brigade, or production team, as long as it is carefully inspected and resolute measures are taken, a batch of labor force can be transferred to strengthen the front line of field production.

Rural production and labor are seasonal. Field labor is busy and idle, and commune industry and sideline production have peak and slack seasons. This situation illustrates the necessity of flexibly allocating labor with agriculture as the center, and illustrates that the division of labor in rural production departments should not be too rigid. In addition to a very small number of commune-run industrial and sideline enterprises that must persist in year-round production, they should generally implement the spirit of engaging in both industry and agriculture, and determine their business scale and operation time according to the needs of agricultural production. The 12 commune-run factories in Fangxian Commune, Danyang County, Jiangsu Province, have 712 people engaged in production, and most of the factories have little relationship with agricultural production and people's lives. Recently, they have been reorganized according to the principle of doing more in slack seasons, doing less in busy seasons, and suspending operations in very busy seasons. A total of 234 people were transferred, 59 people to strengthen the farm tool factory and fertilizer factory, and 175 people to strengthen the grain production front. The brick and tile factory of Beisong Brigade, Qujie Commune, Leinan County, Guangdong Province, which could have been closed during the busy farming season, once employed 72 people for year-round production. Now it is contracted to the team and only produces in the slack farming season, and no labor force is detached from agricultural production, and the brick and tile factory is still doing well.

The various production departments in the countryside are directly or indirectly related to agricultural production, especially grain production. Some serve it, and some are determined by it. Therefore, for various production departments, we must advocate the implementation of comprehensive management around agriculture; for all laborers, we must advocate learning one specialty and multiple skills around agricultural production. This is the most reasonable and economical way to use human, material, and financial resources. The Yongle Commune Alliance Brigade in Sanyuan County, Shaanxi Province, originally had some enterprises that were scattered in operation and "each went its own way," and the production efficiency was not high. After they were combined into a joint enterprise, the great role of labor cooperation and comprehensive utilization was immediately demonstrated. The flour mill, flour factory, and pig farm were combined to transfer half of the labor force to strengthen agricultural production; the vegetable market, farm, and fertilizer factory were combined, not only drawing a lot of labor, but also expanding the planting of more than 100 mu of land. In the past, some grassroots units of communes had too fine a division of labor, emphasizing dedicated personnel for every task. Those who burned firewood did not care about collecting firewood, and those who raised pigs did not care about accumulating manure. Because there were not too many dedicated tasks, it sometimes caused idle waste. According to actual needs, the implementation of one specialty with multiple responsibilities and one person for multiple purposes can give full play to labor potential and greatly save labor. The Hehua Brigade of Chengjiao Commune in Liuyang County, Hunan Province, has 25 canteens. Originally, each canteen had a full-time affairs chief. Now, the full-time has been changed to part-time. The male affairs chief mainly collects firewood, and the female affairs chief mainly raises pigs, saving some full-time firewood collectors and feeders, without affecting the original business of these affairs chiefs. In addition, according to the characteristics, needs, and possibilities of various businesses, fully utilizing auxiliary labor, using female labor instead of male labor, and using weak labor instead of strong labor are also effective ways to save labor, and should be greatly promoted.

In rural people's communes and production teams, the number of non-production personnel should be reduced to the minimum. Professional cultural troupes, sports teams, etc. must be abolished. Even necessary work institutions should be simplified as much as possible. Most full-time cadres and all cadre family members who can work should go down to the teams for production and go to the front line of production. We must repeatedly and deeply publicize the idea that agriculture is the foundation and labor is the most glorious, so that the broad masses of cadres and commune members thoroughly understand the important significance of strengthening the agricultural front and thoroughly understand the truth that labor is the source of all wealth. Whether one can consciously participate in labor, and mobilize and encourage one's family, relatives, and friends to participate in labor happily, is an important sign of testing the ideological awareness and political level of each cadre. Everyone should consciously stand in the forefront of the labor army of developing agricultural production, especially grain production, and be an activist in building a new socialist countryside.

Is it a temporary measure to transfer all the labor force that can be mobilized to the front line of agricultural production? No. We are doing this now, and we will continue to do so in the future. Concentrating labor on the front line is the best way to give full play to the role of labor, save labor, and is also the most important content of building the country diligently and thriftily and running all undertakings diligently and thriftily. When it comes to diligence and thrift, people often focus their attention on financial and material resources, but pay little attention to saving labor. In fact, all material wealth is created by human labor, and without labor, there is nothing. We must cherish materialized labor and cherish living labor even more, so as to maximize the role of people and create more wealth for the country and the people.

### 在公社内部大挖劳动潜力

    在公社内部大挖劳动潜力
    “三秋”前后是一年当中农事最繁忙、劳力最紧张的季节。为了把秋收、秋种、秋耕等项工作全都作好，一方面应该充分发挥正在农业战线上辛勤奋斗的劳动大军的力量，一方面应该把公社企业和事业单位一切可以调动的劳动力，迅速动员到田间生产第一线去。从农村人民公社内部发掘劳动潜力，是加强田间生产第一线的最迅速、最有效的措施。
    随着农业生产和农村工作的全面跃进，公社的工业企业、福利事业和别的“后勤”部门，从田间生产第一线调用一些劳动力，是必要的。没有这些劳动力，建设社会主义新农村的伟大事业就不可能全面发展起来。但是，有的部门，由于缺乏经验，调用的劳动力多了一些；有些人员已经完成了创办公社企业、事业单位的任务，现在可以离开这些部门了；有些企业、事业单位开展了技术革新和技术革命运动，已有可能节约一部分劳动力。在这种情况下，应该毫不迟疑地把这些劳动力抽调出来，立即安排到田间生产第一线去。陕西渭南县固市公社调出管理人员的1.35％、即五百八十多人，生活福利和卫生人员的7％、即三千多人，加强农业战线，使第一线的劳动力由占总劳力的59.2％增加到80％。四川南部县建兴公社整顿了社办企业和事业，调出一千五百多个劳动力（占全社总劳力21.4％），加强了生产第一线。这是两个比较突出的典型，其他公社的劳动力的摆布情况可能并不完全是这样。但是可以肯定，不管哪个公社、哪个大队或者生产小队，只要认真加以检查，采取坚决措施，都能够抽调一批劳动力，增强田间生产第一线。
    农村的生产和劳动都有季节性。田间劳动有忙有闲，公社工业和副业有旺季和淡季。这种情况说明了以农业为中心灵活地调配劳动力的必要性，说明了农村各生产部门的分工不能过死。公社的社办工业和副业企业，除了极少数必须坚持常年生产以外，一般都应当贯彻亦工亦农的精神，根据农业生产的需要，决定他们的经营规模和作业的时间。江苏丹阳县访仙公社十二个社办工厂，有七百一十二人从事生产，多数工厂跟农业生产和人民生活关系不大。最近，他们根据农闲多办、农忙少办、大忙停办的原则进行整顿，共计调出二百三十四人，以五十九人加强农具厂和化肥厂，以一百七十五人加强粮食生产战线。广东雷南县曲界公社北松大队的砖瓦厂，本是农忙可以不办的，一度用了七十二人常年生产。现在包给小队，只在农闲生产，一个脱离农业生产的劳力也不用了，而砖瓦厂照样办得很好。
    农村的各个生产部门，直接间接都跟农业生产、特别是粮食生产有联系。有的是为它服务，有的是被它决定的。因此，对于各个生产部门，要提倡实行围绕农业的综合经营；对于各个劳动者，要提倡学习围绕农业生产的一人多艺。这是最合理、最经济地运用人力、物力、财力的方法。陕西三原县永乐公社联盟大队原有一些企业，分散经营，“各自为政”，生产效率不高。以后把它们组成联合企业，立即显示出劳力协作和综合利用的巨大作用。粉坊、面粉厂和养猪场联合起来，调出一半劳动力加强农业生产；菜场、农场和化肥厂联合起来，不光抽出了大量劳力，还扩种了一百多亩土地。过去，有些公社的基层单位，分工过细，事事强调专人专职，烧火的不管打柴，养猪的不管积肥，由于专职事情并不太多，有时候会造成窝工浪费。按照实际需要，实行一专多兼，一人多用，可以充分发挥劳动潜力，大大节省劳动力。湖南浏阳县城郊公社荷花大队有二十五个食堂，原来每个食堂都设有一个专职事务长，现在把专职改为兼职，男事务长以打柴为主，女事务长以养猪为主，节省了部分专职的打柴人员和饲养人员，并不影响这些事务长的原有业务。此外，按照各种业务的特点、需要和可能，充分利用辅助劳力，以女劳力代男劳力，以弱劳力代强劳力，也是节省劳力的一个有效方法，应该大加提倡。
    在农村人民公社和生产队中，应该把非生产人员减少到最低的限度。专业性的文工团、体育队等必须取消。即使是必要的工作机构也应该一切从简。大部分脱产干部、一切干部家属，凡是能劳动的都应该下队生产，到生产第一线去。要反复深入地宣传农业为基础、劳动最光荣的思想，使广大干部和社员群众彻底了解加强农业战线的重要意义，彻底了解劳动是一切财富的源泉的道理。能不能自觉地参加劳动，并且动员和鼓励自己的家属、亲戚、朋友愉快地参加劳动，是考查每一个干部的思想觉悟和政治水平的重要标志。大家应该自觉地站到发展农业生产、特别是粮食生产的劳动大军的前列，作一个建设社会主义新农村的积极分子。
    把一切可能调动的劳动力都调到农业生产第一线，是不是个临时措施？不是。现在这样作，今后还要这样作。把劳动力集中到第一线，这是充分发挥劳动力的作用，节约劳动力的最好方法，也是勤俭建国、勤俭办一切事业的最重要的内容。谈到勤俭，人们经常把注意力集中在财力物力上，而不大注意劳动力的节省。其实，一切物质财富都是人的劳动创造的，没有劳动就没有一切。我们既要爱惜物化劳动，更要爱惜活劳动，以便发挥人的最大作用，为国家和人民创造更多的财富。
