In recent years, the business community, the intellectual community, and the various democratic parties have all made significant progress.

The main manifestations of this progress are as follows:

1. In the continuing and surging tide of socialist revolution and socialist construction, the majority of people have come along, whether willingly or reluctantly, they have followed along.
2. Specifically, in the process of transitioning from a capitalist stance to a socialist stance:
   - A considerable number of people, more than before, have basically transitioned to a socialist stance. Some of these people are relatively stable, while others still have some vacillation.
   - A considerable number of people, possibly more than the previous group, have transitioned to a semi-socialist stance. They still have significant vacillation, but within this period, they can still waveringly follow along.
   - A small portion of people still maintain a basically capitalist stance. They can be divided into two parts: one part is mainly backward in thought and can gradually progress with education and help; the other part, a very small minority, is reactionary in thought. They may also undergo changes under new conditions.
   - In addition, rightists, after criticism, isolation, and further education and help, are continuing to split. Most of them may gradually transform. Currently, some rightists have transformed well, while only a few have not transformed at all.

3. The various democratic parties and the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce have adhered to the political line of serving socialism, and have implemented the policy of self-education and self-transformation, achieving significant results. The results are mainly positive.

Overall, the situation is very good.

How was this progress achieved?

The progress was achieved for several reasons:

1. It is inseparable from the great victory of the anti-rightist struggle and the rectification movement from 1957 to 1958, which was a great victory in the socialist revolution on the political and ideological fronts. This struggle was a historical turning point for the bourgeoisie and the various democratic parties in accepting socialist transformation. Due to this great victory, whether in the business community, the intellectual community, or among the members of the various democratic parties, the majority, especially the middle-of-the-road elements, have, to varying degrees, shifted from supporting the rightists to supporting socialism and, to varying degrees, are willing to accept the leadership of the Communist Party. Due to this great victory, the various democratic parties have corrected their political lines, rectified their organizations, and transformed their leadership, thereby laying the foundation for becoming a political force that truly serves socialism in name and in reality.

2. It is inseparable from the new situation of socialist revolution and socialist construction in our country. In the past two to three years, the broad masses of workers, peasants, and revolutionary intellectuals, under the radiance of the three red banners of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Communes, have been spirited, enthusiastic, and full of vigor, continuing to deepen the revolution on the political and ideological fronts and launching a comprehensive technological and cultural revolution. This has created a new high tide and a new situation in socialist revolution and socialist construction. The situation compels people to change, whether they want to or not, and they have to "join the revolution" or "be forced into the mountains."

3. It is inseparable from the implementation of the policy of using enterprises and workplaces as bases, labor and practice as foundations, and political and ideological education as the guiding force. In 1958, based on the great victory of the socialist revolution on the political and ideological fronts, we proposed this new policy. In the past two to three years, under the leadership of the Party, all relevant parties, including the active members of the democratic parties, the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce, and non-partisan democrats, have vigorously implemented this policy. On one hand, they have mobilized the enthusiasm for serving socialism, and on the other hand, they have strengthened political and ideological education (including political theory and current policy education), implementing a two-pronged approach. The majority of businesspeople and their families have taken up production and service positions, taking a decisive step in the transition from exploiters to self-sustaining laborers. The majority of intellectuals, through participating in production practice and "three-in-one combinations," have worked and labored with workers and other laboring people, opening up a path for the proletarianization of intellectuals and achieving initial success. Through production struggles and political and ideological education, whether in the business community, the intellectual community, or among the members of the various democratic parties, the majority have, in thought and emotion, moved closer to the working class and the Communist Party, and their enthusiasm for self-transformation has gradually increased. The various democratic parties and the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce have made remarkable achievements in promoting their members to serve socialism and in conducting political and ideological education. They have accumulated considerable experience, and many grassroots organizations have become assistants to the Party organizations in their respective units.

4. The decisive factor in all these elements is the leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao.

Are there still problems?

Yes, there are. A complete assessment should be: significant progress, but there are still problems.

What problems?

1. The continuous revolution promotes people's progress but also makes people feel they can't keep up.
   - "Can't keep up" has become a universal cry. It is natural but also a big problem. What attitude should be taken towards this problem? Some people may take a passive attitude, and some may be unhappy about social progress. This is not good. An active attitude should be taken, and efforts should be made to catch up.

2. The majority of people still have problems of varying degrees in the transformation of their political stance, and a small portion of people's stance has not changed fundamentally.

3. The influence of bourgeois habits has not changed much in many people.

4. The revolution has advanced to the "frontier" of ideology, and real life urgently demands the task of changing one's worldview, that is, the task of comprehensively transforming one's stance, viewpoint, and methods.

These problems essentially reflect the struggle between the two paths of the working class and the bourgeoisie.

In the transitional period, the purpose of the united front of the people's democracy is to complete the socialist revolution and socialist construction, eliminate classes, and gradually transition to communism in the future. The experience of our country shows that to eliminate classes, not only the social system must be changed, but also the political and ideological transformation of all exploiters and petty bourgeoisie must be carried out. This is an unprecedentedly great task in human history. If this task is not accomplished, or if only economic transformation is carried out without the transformation of people, classes cannot be truly eliminated, communism cannot be realized, and the proletariat cannot achieve final liberation. This is a very difficult task that requires a long, repeated, and serious class struggle. Our experience also shows that the transformation on the economic front is relatively easy, while the true difficulty lies in the transformation of people, that is, political and ideological transformation.

To accomplish this great and difficult task, we rely on the powerful people's democratic dictatorship, adopting both democratic and dictatorial methods. For external enemies, that is, all reactionary classes and reactionary forces outside the united front, we implement dictatorship, using violence to confiscate their property, suppress their resistance, and force them to transform into new people through labor. The reactionary classes and reactionary forces mentioned here in our country are mainly the landlord class, the bureaucrat capitalist class, and other counter-revolutionaries. The landlord class and the bureaucrat capitalist class were the two main exploiting and ruling classes in old China and have always been the targets of the new democratic revolution. For these two reactionary classes and other counter-revolutionaries, dictatorship is necessary. We cannot apply benevolent governance to them. Benevolence towards them is cruelty towards the people (even today, in some places where land reform and suppression of counter-revolutionaries are not thorough, they are still causing trouble and harming the people). This issue often causes controversy within the united front, but we always do not compromise because it is a matter of principle. Lenin said, "The recognition or non-recognition of the dictatorship of the proletariat is the touchstone for testing whether one truly understands and recognizes Marxism." Therefore, the question of whether or not to have the dictatorship of the proletariat, and whether or not to use suppression against reactionary classes and counter-revolutionaries, has always been a fundamental issue in the struggle between Marxists and revisionists. Old revisionists talk about "general democracy," and modern revisionists emphasize "humanitarianism." They do not talk about the suppression of enemies and betray the theory of proletarian revolution and proletarian dictatorship. We must draw a clear line with revisionism.

For the internal enemies of the united front, that is, all classes and strata within the people, including the national bourgeoisie, we implement democracy. We generally use democratic methods, that is, methods of unity, criticism, and education, to transform the national bourgeoisie. This is because the national bourgeoisie has two aspects. In the democratic revolutionary period, the national bourgeoisie had a revolutionary aspect and a compromising aspect. In the socialist revolutionary period, the national bourgeoisie has an aspect that supports the constitution and is willing to accept socialist transformation, and an aspect that exploits the working class and takes the capitalist path. Therefore, the national bourgeoisie is different from the bureaucrat capitalist class. The bureaucrat capitalist class, that is, the monopolist capitalist class, owns 80% of the industrial and commercial capital of the whole country. They are the running dogs of international imperialism and the main ruling class in the counter-revolutionary rule of China, with both hands holding bloody knives. The people can only use knives against knives, chop them down, and then step on them with their feet. For them, there is no possibility of peaceful transformation or peaceful transition.

Someone might ask: Since this is the case, why did the Communist Party of China cooperate with the bureaucrat capitalist class represented by Chiang Kai-shek during the War of Resistance against Japan, and after the end of the War of Resistance against Japan, why did they talk about peace and democracy? During the War of Resistance against Japan, the contradiction between China and Japanese imperialism rose to the main contradiction, and the class contradictions within our country and the contradictions between our country and British and American imperialism were reduced to secondary and subordinate positions. Within the British and American imperialists and the big bourgeoisie of the British and American factions, the contradictions between the big bourgeoisie of the British and American factions and the big bourgeoisie of the pro-Japanese faction were widened, which made the Chiang Kai-shek clique, representing the big bourgeoisie of the British and American factions, participate in the resistance against Japan to a certain extent under the pressure of the anti-Japanese forces of the people within the country. In this situation, utilizing the contradictions between British and American imperialism and Japanese imperialism and between the big bourgeoisie of the British and American factions and the big bourgeoisie of the pro-Japanese faction is of great importance for achieving the war of resistance and winning the war of resistance. If we do not utilize these contradictions and unite with the Chiang Kai-shek clique to resist Japan, it is certainly wrong. However, even at that time, this part of the big bourgeoisie was still very reactionary, and they were the passive anti-Japanese and active anti-communist diehards in the anti-Japanese national united front. In the early stages of the War of Resistance against Japan, the second Rongming line of capitulationism occurred within our party, advocating dependence on the Kuomintang to resist Japan instead of relying on the people's war of resistance, opposing the independent and autonomous policy of the Communist Party in the anti-Japanese national united front to contend for the leadership of the proletariat, and advocating that everything should be done through the Kuomintang, handing over the leadership to the big bourgeoisie. Under the leadership of the Central Committee headed by Chairman Mao, our party resolutely opposed and overcame this capitulationism, adhered to the policy of independent autonomy under the united front, and adhered to the policy of developing progressive forces, winning over middle forces, and isolating diehard forces. Based on these policies, we vigorously developed anti-Japanese people's armed forces and anti-Japanese democratic base areas behind enemy lines; for the political oppression and armed attacks of the Kuomintang diehards, we carried out a struggle that was sharp but reasonable, beneficial, and moderate, based on the principle of seeking unity through struggle. In military terms, we did not attack unless attacked, and if attacked, we attacked back, and we resolutely, thoroughly, completely, and cleanly annihilated the enemy. Due to the adherence and implementation of this series of policies, our party gradually isolated the big bourgeoisie diehards, firmly grasped the leadership of the anti-Japanese national united front and the War of Resistance against Japan, led the War of Resistance against Japan to final victory, and prepared the decisive conditions for the subsequent victory of the people's liberation war. After Japan's surrender, the people of the whole country urgently demanded peace and democracy, while American imperialism and Chiang Kai-shek adopted a policy of peaceful deception as a means to prepare for civil war, win hearts and minds, and isolate our party. Our party saw through the trickery of the Americans and Chiang Kai-shek, on the one hand, actively prepared for revolutionary war against counter-revolutionary war, and on the other hand, representing the wishes of the people of the whole country, initiated and led the people of the whole country to struggle for peace and democracy. In the latter aspect, that is, in the struggle for peace and democracy, we mainly relied on mass movements, utilizing all possible means to influence and mobilize the people in the Kuomintang-controlled areas to struggle; at the same time, we negotiated with the Kuomintang, made necessary concessions to the Kuomintang without harming the fundamental interests of the people, and reached a ceasefire agreement and political agreement that was basically beneficial to the people. Negotiations are another form of struggle, especially when the Kuomintang was tearing up the agreement behind the people's backs, we insisted on carrying out the negotiations to the end to thoroughly expose the conspiracy of false peace and true civil war by the Americans and Chiang Kai-shek, and to educate the broad masses of the people. Due to the adoption of the correct line and policy mentioned above, when Chiang Kai-shek clique formally tore up the agreement and launched a full-scale civil war, it was completely isolated, while our party was in an unbeatable position both politically and militarily. Compared with 1927, a completely different situation emerged. In 1927, the right-opportunist Chen Duxiu advocated a line and policy of capitulationism towards the Kuomintang, only uniting without struggle, and was completely unprepared for the sudden counter-revolutionary attack by Chiang Kai-shek, resulting in a painful failure of the revolution. This time, because we prepared two hands, that is, we prepared for both peaceful political struggle and armed struggle after peace was broken, instead of just one hand, we not only did not suffer any losses but also quickly defeated American imperialism and Chiang Kai-shek, achieving revolutionary victory.

In the long-term new democratic revolution, a Marxist-Leninist Chinese Communist Party led by Chairman Mao, a powerful people's army led by the Party, and a broad united front based on the worker-peasant alliance and including the national bourgeoisie were forged. Relying on these three magic weapons, we overthrew the three great enemies of the Chinese revolution and the Kuomintang reactionary rule, established a powerful people's democratic dictatorship, and ensured that our country could gradually realize the socialist revolution through a peaceful path. The national bourgeoisie is mainly composed of medium and small capitalist elements, accounting for only about 20% of the entire capitalist economy, and is an economically weak and therefore politically two-faced class; in the new democratic revolution, they generally adopted a neutral or participating attitude. In the first period of the domestic revolutionary war, the national bourgeoisie participated in the united front led by the Communist Party. From 1927 to 1931, they supported the counter-revolution, but basically did not hold power and were oppressed and restricted by the ruling big landlords and big bourgeoisie. Since the War of Resistance against Japan, the national bourgeoisie has participated in the united front led by the Communist Party. Finally, in the later period of the liberation war, they turned to the side of the people's revolution. After liberation, the national bourgeoisie is no longer a middle class; their contradictions with the working class have become the main contradiction within our country. However, the national bourgeoisie continues to remain within the united front of people's democracy, indicating their continued acceptance of the leadership of the Communist Party, and thus, there is the possibility of accepting socialist transformation under the people's democratic dictatorship. In the specific historical conditions of the development of the revolution, the original two-faced nature of the national bourgeoisie has also developed and transformed into the new two-faced nature of the socialist revolutionary period. "The contradiction between the working class and the national bourgeoisie belongs to the contradictions within the people. The class struggle between the working class and the national bourgeoisie generally belongs to the class struggle within the people" (Note 2), and can be resolved by peaceful methods, that is, methods of unity, criticism, and education. Whether in the period of democratic revolution or in the period of socialist revolution, the national bourgeoisie has two aspects; and the reason why the national bourgeoisie can, under the leadership of the working class, gradually participate in the new democratic revolution and gradually accept socialist transformation is that their two-faced nature contains an active aspect. Ignoring this aspect and equating them with the bureaucrat capitalist class would lead to the error of "left" opportunism.

However, the national bourgeoisie's two-faced nature, as mentioned above, also has a negative and reactionary aspect. Therefore, the struggle between the working class and the national bourgeoisie, whether in the past or present, is full of class struggle. In the transitional period, the struggle between these two classes is a struggle over whether the socialist path or the capitalist path will prevail. Socialism is the elimination of the system of exploitation and the exploiting class, which is of course contrary to the nature of the national bourgeoisie. Any exploiting class and its strata and groups, including the national bourgeoisie, no matter how enlightened or "wise" they are, and no matter how big or small they are, will not willingly retire from the historical stage without struggle. Although the national bourgeoisie in our country has never held power, they have controlled a part of modern enterprises and modern cultural and technological knowledge and have led the old democratic revolution, with a history of anti-imperialism and patriotism. They have had a relatively broad economic connection and political and ideological influence in society. They rely on these things as capital to struggle against the working class. At the same time, imperialism and the reactionary classes within the country that have been overthrown have placed their hopes of restoration on the national bourgeoisie, hoping that "democratic individualism will once again show its prowess" (Note 3); this again becomes the backing for the class struggle of some upper-layer reactionaries within the national bourgeoisie. Therefore, we must not ignore the negative and reactionary aspect of the national bourgeoisie. Anyone who ignores this aspect will commit the error of right opportunism or revisionism.

Due to the two-faced nature of the national bourgeoisie formed by the specific historical conditions of China, on the one hand, it determines the possibility of peaceful transformation, and on the other hand, it determines that peaceful transformation can only be the continuation of class struggle in a special form. The experience of our country in the past decade has proven that the working class correctly utilizing the possibility of peaceful transformation of the national bourgeoisie is beneficial to the people and beneficial to socialism. The experience of our country has even more proven that to achieve peaceful transformation, the working class must first grasp the powerful state machine. The Chinese working class, after decades of armed struggle, finally seized power, established a powerful people's democratic dictatorship, and thus is not afraid of the national bourgeoisie's rebellion and has the strength to carry out socialist transformation of them through peaceful methods. The victory of the people's revolutionary war and the powerful people's democratic dictatorship established by this victory are the fundamental prerequisites for achieving peaceful transformation. Without the victory of the people's revolutionary war, there would be, and could not be, a people's democratic dictatorship; and without a people's democratic dictatorship, there would be, and could not be, any peaceful transformation. From this, it is very clear that our country's peaceful transformation of the national bourgeoisie is completely unrelated to the "peaceful transition" without going through a violent revolution to seize power.

After the Chinese working class seized state power, it developed the powerful advantages of socialism at a very high speed. According to the experience of our country, this is a basic condition for promoting the national bourgeoisie to gradually accept socialist transformation. With the complete victory of the liberation war, we confiscated all the bureaucrat capital that controlled the economic lifeline of the country and transformed it into state-owned socialist economy, becoming the material force for carrying out socialist transformation of the national capital and individual economy. After that, the stabilization of prices, the resistance against U.S. aggression and aid to Korea, land reform, the suppression of counter-revolutionaries, ideological transformation, the three anti and five anti campaigns, and the victories of the broad masses of the people's struggles, the development of the state-owned economy, and the arrival of the high tide of agricultural cooperativization all step by step promoted the national bourgeoisie, making them have to gradually take the path of accepting socialist transformation and finally, in 1956, the high tide of comprehensive joint state-private operations appeared. After the anti-rightist struggle and the rectification movement, six hundred million people were full of enthusiasm and vigor, with great momentum, "the former exploiting class has completely fallen into the vast ocean of the laboring masses, they have to change even if they don't want to" (Note 4), and thus the high tide of participating in labor and serving socialism appeared. Capitalism is gradually being eliminated, and the trend of socialism is increasingly compelling, making the people of the bourgeoisie gradually accept socialist transformation. Without the advantages of socialism, without developing these advantages, and expecting the people of the bourgeoisie to spontaneously and voluntarily take the socialist path, if it is not due to naive illusions, it is a mockery of Marxism-Leninism. Now, the comprehensive technological and cultural revolution is unfolding, and the ranks of the working-class intellectuals are unprecedentedly expanding. In this situation, some bourgeois intellectuals may feel isolated, and I think this is not a bad thing, but a good thing. As long as people take the correct attitude, this situation will not lead them to retreat and decline but will definitely lead them to progress and brightness.

The policy of our party of unity-struggle-unity is another basic condition for guiding and promoting the national bourgeoisie to gradually accept socialist transformation. This is the basic policy of our party in correctly handling the relationship between the working class and the national bourgeoisie, that is, the basic method of class struggle between the working class and the national bourgeoisie. This policy and method are to have unity and struggle, to start from unity and conduct struggle, with unity as the goal and struggle as the means. Generally speaking, "for transformation, unity must come first" (Note 5); as for whether unity or struggle should be the main focus in a certain period or aspect, this depends on the specific situation. There is unity and struggle, mainly to mobilize them to participate in the struggle against domestic and foreign enemies; to give full play to their active role in socialist construction, to encourage their enthusiasm for accepting socialist transformation, to lean to one side, to rush forward; to appropriately care for their reasonable interests—economic compensation, political arrangements, to take them in, to take them to the end; to help them study, to criticize and educate their mistakes. Unity and struggle cannot be separated, and criticism is our main weapon of struggle. In the past decade, using this weapon, we have carried out several fierce struggles with the national bourgeoisie initiated by them, and we have also carried out a large amount of continuous educational work for them. For the national bourgeoisie, accepting socialist transformation is contrary to their nature, so it is of course passive. However, due to the implementation of the policy of unity-struggle-unity by our party, it has gradually awakened and promoted their self-awareness and voluntarism, making their majority, in the overall passivity, step by step, to varying degrees, from passivity to activity, not too reluctantly accepting socialist transformation.

In the past decade, the class struggle between the working class and the national bourgeoisie has been gradually unfolding on the economic, political, and ideological fronts. On the economic front, through the recovery of the national economy, through the severe struggle of the three anti and five anti campaigns, through several years of utilization, restriction, and transformation, especially through the development of state capitalism from low-level to high-level forms, we basically completed the transformation of ownership in 1956. However, the basic completion of ownership transformation did not end the class struggle but turned it into a deeper development, reflecting and unfolding on the political and ideological fronts. The bourgeoisie, although they have lost their enterprises, are not convinced of the Communist Party and the working class, and their rightist elements are determined to engage in a showdown. Therefore, the rightist attack of 1957 and the subsequent anti-rightist struggle and rectification movement appeared. Everyone knows that the anti-rightist struggle and the rectification movement are a great socialist revolution on the political and ideological fronts, a decisive battle between the socialist path and the capitalist path. This battle proved that the socialist revolution on the economic front alone is not enough and is not solid; there must also be a thorough socialist revolution on the political and ideological fronts. The right-opportunist elements within the party attacked the party again in 1959, representing the desire for the restoration of capitalism, again proving the truth pointed out by Chairman Mao. This battle also proved that the majority, if not the vast majority, of the national bourgeoisie can gradually accept socialist transformation, and in such a situation, their contradictions with the working class belong to the contradictions within the people. However, because this is a special kind of contradiction within the people, and because it is handled by the method of peaceful transformation, it requires a long process of struggle to achieve the resolution of the contradiction. In this struggle, it is inevitable that a small number of elements who are unwilling to see the death of the capitalist system and the bourgeoisie will rise up to resist. These elements are the rightist elements of the bourgeoisie. It is not difficult to imagine that if they had weapons in their hands, they would, like the reactionary serf owners in Tibet, launch armed counter-revolutionary rebellions. Their contradictions with the people are life-and-death contradictions. It is necessary to thoroughly expose and criticize these rightist elements to benefit the majority of the bourgeoisie in continuing to advance on the path of accepting socialist transformation and not retreating.

Now, class struggle is still ongoing and will continue for a very long time. As long as the bourgeoisie still exists, the political and ideological influence of the bourgeoisie still exists, and the habitual forces of the bourgeoisie and petty bourgeoisie still exist, class struggle will not be extinguished.

The development of class struggle is complex, tortuous, and repetitive, and like waves, it rises and falls. In the past ten years, several big waves have appeared. In the future, generally speaking, the proletariat will become stronger the more it struggles, and the bourgeoisie will become more divided and weakened the more it struggles, until it is eliminated. However, this trend will still be realized through multiple repetitions of struggle. Small repetitions are inevitable, and under certain conditions, the appearance of big repetitions and big waves is also possible. The big waves of class struggle sometimes occur in the combination of international and domestic conditions. For example, the big wave of class struggle in the summer of 1957 was initiated by the rightist elements of the bourgeoisie in the context of the deepening of the revolution domestically and the international anti-Soviet and anti-communist wave after the Hungarian incident. Now, international imperialism is using modern revisionism to spread fear and illusions about imperialism, splitting the unity of the world's people; and the national bourgeoisie is still the most easily shaken part of our people, and in the context of the continued deepening of the socialist revolution domestically, some people feel that revisionism suits their taste and are interested in various kinds of revisionism. Therefore, while uniting the business community, the intellectual community, and the various democratic parties to struggle against imperialism, we should also conduct education and learning to oppose revisionism among them, help them recognize the essence of revisionism, draw a clear line with revisionism, learn from the lessons of 1957, and in the possible waves, stand firm and avoid being led into dangerous swamps by revisionism. This is an important task in the current class struggle.

In the process of continuous revolution, it is inevitable and in accordance with the law that class struggle is sometimes tense and sometimes relaxed. The people of the bourgeoisie feel that class struggle is tense, one is due to resisting the revolution and attacking the working class (such as the three anti and five anti campaigns and the anti-rightist struggle), and the other is due to not being able to keep up. These are two different situations. We should distinguish between these two types of situations and between anti-socialist elements and relatively backward people. For all those who want to follow but find it difficult to keep up, we should not look down on them or find them troublesome, but should care for them, study their difficulties and problems, and actively and patiently help them. Chairman Mao instructed us: "The attitude of the Communist Party members towards backward people is not to despise them, look down on them, but to approach them, unite with them, persuade them, and encourage them to move forward" (Note 6). We must adopt this attitude.

Transforming one's worldview is to abandon the bourgeois worldview and establish a proletarian worldview.

Our country is currently in a new high tide and new situation of socialist revolution and socialist construction. On all fronts, the struggle to promote proletarian thought and eliminate bourgeois thought is prominent, and the struggle between the two paths is prominently reflected in the struggle to promote proletarian thought and eliminate bourgeois thought, to break the bourgeois worldview and establish the proletarian worldview. Chairman Mao said, "The proletariat wants to transform the world according to its worldview, and the bourgeoisie also wants to transform the world according to its worldview. In this regard, the question of who will win and who will lose between socialism and capitalism has not been truly resolved" (Note 7). Now, the broad masses of laboring people are rising up to study Chairman Mao's works. It can be said that the continuation and development of this study will determine the question of who will win and who will lose, and will create a favorable situation for the business community, the intellectual community, and the members of the various democratic parties to change their worldview.

Worldview is the stance, viewpoint, and method of observing and handling things. The proletariat uses the proletarian stance, viewpoint, and method to observe and handle things, and the bourgeoisie uses the bourgeois stance, viewpoint, and method to observe and handle things. The contradiction and struggle between these two worldviews are irreconcilable and should not be reconciled. The proletarian worldview, that is, dialectical and historical materialism, is the correct reflection of the general laws of nature, society, and thought, and is the only scientific worldview. The proletariat and the Communist Party can and should form a certain political united front with people who have a bourgeois worldview and theists, and strive to expand this united front, uniting all those who can be united. The united front of the people's democracy in our country, in the transitional period, is based on the six political criteria proposed by Chairman Mao, broadly uniting the people of the whole country to jointly carry out the socialist revolution and build socialism. However, within the united front, the proletarian thought and the bourgeois thought, the proletarian worldview and the bourgeois worldview, atheism and theism, must draw a clear line and must not be reconciled or confused. If one thinks that since a political united front should be formed, the line should not be drawn in thought or even confused, that would be a violation of principle. In our party, this is a rightist error. Conversely, if one thinks that since the line should be drawn in thought, the political united front should be abandoned and not based on the six political criteria to unite all those who can be united, that would also be a violation of principle. In our party, this is a "leftist" error.

The process of socialist revolution and socialist construction is the process of transforming the world according to the proletarian worldview. In this process, some people feel very uncomfortable, to the point of developing various negative and resistant emotions. In our view, this is ultimately due to the problem of worldview. Taking an opposing attitude is certainly due to a wrong worldview; the so-called inability to keep up is also mainly due to a wrong worldview. Therefore, for them, changing their worldview has become an urgent task.

Changing one's worldview will bring enthusiasm and vigor to the socialist revolution and socialist construction, and one will be able to keep up. Changing one's worldview will not only be able to keep up with the development of the situation but may also be able to foresee the development of the situation. No matter what political storms arise in China and the world, one will be able to stand firm and not easily be shaken. Without changing one's worldview, there will be danger, and one will not be able to withstand major storms.

In this meeting of several democratic parties, the issues of "knowledge privatization," "self-centeredness," and "intellectual arrogance" were discussed. All these things and other similar things, ultimately, are products of the bourgeois worldview. Bourgeois intellectuals were originally nurtured by the labor fruits of workers and peasants, and their knowledge was originally derived from the practical experience of workers and peasants. However, once they mastered knowledge, they treated it as private capital, demanding "one investment, ten returns," serving only the exploiting class and not the working peasants, and denying that the practice of workers and peasants is the source of knowledge, looking down on the practical experience of workers and peasants, and adopting an arrogant attitude towards the working peasants. Is this not forgetting one's roots and turning things upside down? Is this not the bourgeois worldview?

Transforming one's worldview is to change this upside-down phenomenon. Chairman Mao pointed out long ago that intellectuals should serve the workers and peasants, unite with them, and take the path of proletarianization. "The final dividing line between revolutionary and non-revolutionary or counter-revolutionary intellectuals is whether they are willing to and actually unite with the workers and peasants" (Note 8). Chairman Mao also pointed out that this is the "sole criterion" (Note 8). Now, the methods adopted by our country for intellectuals to participate in labor, the "three-in-one combination" method, and other related methods have opened up a broad path for intellectuals to unite with workers and peasants and gradually proletarianize (Note 9). In the past two to three years, many people have served socialism together with workers and peasants and have begun to take the path of proletarianization. Their worldview has changed to a certain extent, and their knowledge has been corrected and enriched to a certain extent through practice. This is a good phenomenon. The knowledge of bourgeois intellectuals has a part that is useful for socialist construction, which is a national treasure that needs to be preserved and developed; and another part that is useless and even harmful, which should be discarded. Therefore, in dealing with the knowledge of bourgeois intellectuals, specific analysis and criticism are needed to take the essence and discard the dregs. Uniting with the masses of workers and peasants, through revolutionary practice and production practice, is the necessary path for transforming one's worldview and achieving proletarianization, and is also the necessary path for identifying, transforming, and developing useful knowledge. Bourgeois intellectuals should take this path, and bourgeois businesspeople should also take this path, and both should keep moving forward.

Title: On the Transformation of the World Outlook of the Intellectuals

Some natural scientists believe that those engaged in natural sciences are inherently dialectical materialists and do not need to transform their world outlook. I do not see it that way. It is true that bourgeois natural scientists, if they seriously adopt a scientific attitude and engage in scientific and technological practice, may possess some spontaneous materialist and dialectical elements within a certain scope; otherwise, their scientific and technological activities would not be successful. However, fundamentally and as a whole, their thought system is bourgeois; especially in the realm of social life, since they serve the bourgeoisie, they are more thoroughly imbued with the bourgeois world outlook. Therefore, their scientific and technological activities, lacking the guidance of a correct world outlook, have to grope in the dark; and as soon as they step out of that narrow scope of activity, they will inevitably be dominated by idealism and metaphysics.

Since liberation, through learning and practice, many people have made varying degrees of progress. However, it must be admitted that for most people, this problem is far from being solved. Some people think that intellectuals are more elevated than capitalists and should not be compared with capitalists. I do not see it that way. Generally, bourgeois intellectuals do not own the means of production and do not directly exploit workers; in this sense, they are different from capitalists. However, they, like capitalists, originally relied on capitalism for a living. In old China, there were imperialist, feudalist, bureaucratic capitalist, national capitalist, and individual economies. Intellectuals could only rely on these five economies for a living and serve these five economies. Bourgeois intellectuals are mainly those who rely on capitalist economies for a living and serve capitalist economies. They and capitalists are two parts of the same class and are fundamentally the same in class nature. Therefore, whether they are capitalists or bourgeois intellectuals, and whether they engage in social sciences or natural sciences, they must undergo socialist transformation, discard the bourgeois world outlook, and establish the proletarian world outlook. In the historical development of our revolution, the proletarian world outlook has already taken the lead in the field of social sciences; now it is taking the lead in the field of natural sciences. In the future, the comprehensive and in-depth development of our political revolution, ideological revolution, technological revolution, and cultural revolution will not only break away from the bourgeois world outlook in the field of social sciences but also in the field of natural sciences, to establish the proletarian world outlook. This is certain, inevitable, and unstoppable. We hope that our friends in the intellectual community can follow this historical development law and strive to transform their world outlook.

Some people separate stance, viewpoint, and method, or even oppose them, believing that since the problem of transforming the world outlook is raised, the problem of transforming the stance has already been solved. This is a misunderstanding. Stance, viewpoint, and method are unified and inseparable, and the problem of class stance is always the primary and fundamental problem. In 1957, we emphasized the transformation of stance because at that time, capitalist ownership had basically changed, and the law of social development in our country required that bourgeois people change their political stance. The rightists' attack exposed the reactionary essence of the bourgeois stance, highlighting the problem of stance, so we had to shout loudly: the bourgeois stance is reactionary and must be transformed. During the criticism of the rightists, we concentrated on exposing their reactionary stance and also exposed their reactionary method of "attacking one point and not covering the rest." Through the anti-rightist struggle and the rectification movement, and through the deepening development of socialist revolution on the political and ideological fronts over the past two or three years, and the comprehensive development of technological and cultural revolutions, as mentioned earlier, the need for ideological transformation requires a comprehensive demand for transforming stance, viewpoint, and method. People's erroneous viewpoints, in addition to coming from class stance, also come from thought recognition or thought method. Correct stance and correct thought method are unified and inseparable; if either is lacking, it is impossible to have a correct viewpoint. The problem of stance is always the primary and fundamental problem at any time, and people's thought recognition or thought method is also determined by their stance. However, thought recognition or thought method can also turn around and influence stance. Therefore, the transformation of thought recognition or thought method should not be opposed to the transformation of stance but should promote the transformation of stance.

The transformation of world outlook requires a long time and great effort. Whether in the industrial and commercial circles, intellectual circles, or among members of various democratic parties, everyone should follow Chairman Mao's instruction: "In one's work and study, gradually establish a communist world outlook, gradually learn Marxism-Leninism, and gradually blend with the workers and peasants, without stopping halfway, let alone retreating. Retreat is a dead end." (Note 10) Appropriate criticism and self-criticism are necessary. Old things cannot be changed without criticism. The proletarian world outlook requires people to always adopt a critical attitude towards their knowledge and cognition. Because cognition is a reflection of objective things, it always lags behind the development of objective things. If anyone does not adopt a critical attitude towards their knowledge and cognition, they cannot correctly reflect and recognize the objective world, cannot see new things, and will fall behind the times. However, the transformation of world outlook can only be carried out gradually and cannot be rushed. In this matter, we must patiently and meticulously do the work. "Ideological struggle is different from other struggles; it cannot adopt rough and coercive methods but must use meticulous and persuasive methods." (Note 11) Some people may not change in a short time, but we can wait for them while actively and patiently helping them. In the matter of transforming the world outlook, patience is necessary, and some waiting is also necessary. In addition, "in fact, there will definitely be some people who are unwilling to accept Marxism-Leninism and unwilling to accept communism in their thoughts. For this part of the people, do not be demanding; as long as they obey the state's requirements and engage in normal labor, we should give them appropriate opportunities to work." (Note 12)

Learning Chairman Mao's works is essential to learning Marxism-Leninism and transforming the world outlook.

Here, I will share some personal insights.

Learning Chairman Mao's works is to learn Mao Zedong Thought. Mao Zedong Thought is formed and developed in the process of combining Marxism-Leninism's universal truth with the practice of the Chinese revolution and construction, and in the struggle against right opportunism, "left" opportunism, and modern revisionism. Over the past forty years, Chairman Mao, in revolutionary practice and theoretical work, has defended and developed Marxism-Leninism from various aspects, leading the Chinese revolution from one victory to another, and providing a brilliant example and sharp weapon for all the broad masses of people around the world who are struggling for liberation and light. Mao Zedong Thought is Marxism-Leninism fully developed in the era of proletarian socialist revolution.

The combination of theory and practice includes the two aspects of actively recognizing the world and actively transforming the world. Marx said: "It is not the consciousness of men that determines their existence, but their social existence that determines their consciousness." He also said: "Philosophers have only interpreted the world in various ways; the point is to change it." (Note 13) After quoting these two sentences of Marx, Chairman Mao pointed out: "This is the first correct solution to the relationship between consciousness and existence in human history, and it is the fundamental view of the active and revolutionary reflection theory that was deeply expounded by Lenin later." (Note 14) My understanding is that Chairman Mao here said that we should actively recognize society and nature from practice, discover their laws, and then use the discovered laws to actively transform society and nature through practice. In other words, we should go from practice to theory and then from theory to practice, repeatedly combining theory and practice, constantly recognizing the world, and constantly transforming the world, "and the content of each cycle of practice and cognition is relatively advanced to a higher level." (Note 15) This process of practice-theory-practice is also what Chairman Mao said, from the masses to the masses. The masses are the creators of history; our theory, fundamentally speaking, is a summary of the masses' struggle experience and serves the masses' struggle. We must participate in the masses' struggle, learn from the masses, obtain raw materials from the masses, process them through work, and turn them into theory, policy, plan, opinion, etc., and then go to the masses to propagate and practice with the masses, test them. Then, gather them from the masses again and go to the masses to persist, and so on in a cycle. Any hero, if separated from the masses' practice, will cut off the source of knowledge and will not be able to actively recognize the world and actively transform the world.

Chairman Mao repeatedly taught us that we must strive for a unified understanding of Marxism-Leninism theory and Chinese revolutionary practice, "must completely and appropriately unite Marxism's universal truth with the specific practice of the Chinese revolution, that is, unite with national characteristics, go through a certain national form, and only then will it be useful, and it must not be applied subjectively and formulaically." (Note 17) People often say to creatively apply Marxism-Leninism. What is creativity? In my opinion, as Chairman Mao said, combining Marxism-Leninism's universal truth with revolutionary specific practice and striving to completely and appropriately combine them is creativity. Practice is not only the standard of theory but also the source of theory. New theories in human history are always produced in new practices. Once theory is completely and appropriately combined with practice, it will inevitably be enriched and developed in new practices. "Only those who are good at applying Marxism-Leninism's universal truth according to their national characteristics can succeed in the cause of the proletariat in each country. And as long as they do this, they will create their own new experiences and thus contribute to the Marxism-Leninism treasury and the whole nation." (Note 18) In revolutionary struggle and theoretical work, Chairman Mao combined Marxism-Leninism's universal truth with revolutionary specific practice completely and appropriately, and did this continuously and unremittingly for decades, day after day, so from various aspects, he developed Marxism-Leninism and continues to develop Marxism-Leninism, providing us with a brilliant example of creatively applying and developing Marxism-Leninism.

To learn Chairman Mao's works, we must use the method of combining theory and practice, adopting the attitude of hitting the target and seeking truth from facts as indicated by Chairman Mao in "Reform Our Study."

Hitting the target and seeking truth from facts is to use Marxism-Leninism's universal truth as a guide to specifically analyze specific things, find the inherent laws of development of specific things, guide practice, and unite the recognition of the world and the transformation of the world.

Chairman Mao has always taught us that the world is unified and also diverse, and there is no thing in the world that cannot be analyzed; it is just that the situation is different and the nature is different. Everything in the world is a unity of contradictions. "Contradictions exist in all processes and run through the entire process of all processes. Contradictions are movement, are things, are processes, and also are thought. Denying the contradiction of things is denying everything. This is a common truth, ancient and modern, Chinese and foreign, none can escape." (Note 19) We observe things and cannot separate from the universal truth of the common law of contradiction development; otherwise, we will be like a frog in a well, seeing the tree but not the forest, losing direction, so we must find the arrow of Marxism-Leninism. However, "the universality of contradictions lies in the particularity of contradictions." (Note 20)

"The basis of our knowledge of things is to pay attention to its particularity, that is, to pay attention to its qualitative difference from other forms of motion. Only by paying attention to this can we distinguish things. Any form of motion, within it, contains its particular contradictions. This particular contradiction constitutes the special essence of a thing that distinguishes it from other things. This is the internal cause or basis of the thousand differences in things in the world." (Note 21) Between one thing and another thing, between different development stages of one thing, and between different aspects of the contradiction of one thing, there are all special characteristics; so we cannot treat things as a solid block but must specifically analyze specific things. Whether studying knowledge, handling work, from proposing problems to solving problems, we must conduct investigations and research, and conduct thorough and systematic investigations and research. When analyzing and researching specific things, we must especially pay attention to finding the main contradiction and the main aspect of the contradiction, because: "The study of various unbalanced situations of contradictions, the study of the main contradictions and non-main contradictions, the main aspects of contradictions and non-main aspects of contradictions, is an important method for a revolutionary party to correctly determine its political and military strategic and tactical policies, and it is something that all communists should pay attention to." (Note 22) We find the arrow of Marxism-Leninism's universal truth, not for anything else, precisely to guide us to specifically analyze things, find laws, and solve contradictions. Chairman Mao often quoted Lenin's words to remind us:

"The most essential thing in Marxism, the living soul of Marxism, lies in concretely analyzing concrete situations." (Note 23) This is the reason.

Hitting the target, seeking truth from facts, combining theory and practice, is also combining the general and the particular. Chairman Mao instructed us that the movement of human cognition is always first from the particular to the general, that is, first recognizing the particular essence of many different things (specific laws) in practice, and then further summarizing the common essence of various things (universal laws). Then, with this common essence or universal law as a guide, continue to study various specific things that have not been studied, find their particular essence or particular laws, and guide our practice. So, the process from practice to theory and then from theory to practice can be understood as the process from the particular to the general and then from the general to the particular.

This method of analyzing the contradictions of things, applied to society, is most fundamentally the method of class analysis. Chairman Mao's guidance of China's revolutionary theory and strategy has always been based on analyzing China's various classes and the classes of imperialist countries according to Marxism-Leninism.

In summary, combining theory and practice, from the masses to the masses, specific analysis of specific things, is the core of the Marxism-Leninism world outlook. To transform the world outlook, one must learn to grasp this core.

Only by combining theory and practice can it be truly revolutionary and have revolutionary thoroughness. When discussing the differences between communism and the Three Principles of the People, Chairman Mao said:

"Communists are consistent in theory and practice, that is, they have revolutionary thoroughness. The Three Principles of the People, except for those who are most loyal to the revolution and truth, are inconsistent in theory and practice, and what they say and do are contradictory, that is, they lack revolutionary thoroughness." (Note 24) Chairman Mao also said: "Without a scientific attitude, that is, without the attitude of unity of Marxism-Leninism theory and practice, it is called having no party spirit or incomplete party spirit." (Note 25)

Opposing right opportunism or revisionism, opposing "left" opportunism or dogmatism, is an indispensable condition for ensuring the combination of Marxism-Leninism's universal truth and revolutionary practice. In the Chinese revolutionary movement, Chairman Mao conducted a thorough struggle against right opportunism and "left" opportunism, thereby completely and appropriately combining Marxism-Leninism's universal truth with the specific practice of the Chinese revolution. Dogmatists cut off the connection between revolutionary theory and revolutionary practice from the left, and they are a faction within the proletarian ranks, but they are contaminated with small-bourgeois fanatical views. Their will is revolutionary, but "they refuse to do any hard research work on specific things, they regard general truth as something that appears out of thin air, and turn it into a purely abstract formula that people cannot grasp," (Note 26) detached from practice, detached from the masses, often leading to adventurism, so they cannot be truly or completely revolutionary thoroughness. Revisionists cut off the connection between revolutionary theory and revolutionary practice from the right, and they yield to the influence of the bourgeoisie and the threat of imperialism, "under the pretext of creatively developing Marxism-Leninism, denying the significance of Marxism-Leninism's universal truth." (Note 27)

"Under the pretext of national characteristics, they deviate from Marxism-Leninism's universal truth about socialist revolution and socialist construction." (Note 28) They often, for the sake of temporary, trifling interests, abandon the fundamental, long-term interests of the proletariat, thereby losing their revolutionary nature and not wanting the masses' revolutionary struggle. They also oppose "dogmatism," but what they oppose is precisely the most fundamental thing in Marxism-Leninism. China's revolutionary experience proves that in uniting with the bourgeoisie in a united front, right opportunism or revisionism becomes the main danger. Revisionists always ignore or forget that the peasantry is the main force of the revolution, that the worker-peasant alliance is the basis, that armed struggle is the main form of revolution, ignore or forget the decisive role of the leadership of the proletariat and the Communist Party, ignore or forget the vacillation and reactionary nature of the bourgeoisie, and pin their hopes on the bourgeoisie, even the big bourgeoisie, not fighting for leadership but handing over leadership to them. Modern revisionists are the same; in the struggle for peace, democracy, national independence, and socialism, they always ignore or forget that only the people's revolutionary struggle is the decisive factor for victory, and fantasize that the ruling bourgeoisie, even imperialists, will change their nature, so they only talk about peace and peaceful transition, and do not prepare to use violent revolution against violent counter-revolution, to use revolutionary war against counter-revolutionary war.

Using the method of combining theory and practice to learn Chairman Mao's works, we must also use the method of analysis, not swallowing whole and memorizing sentences. Without analysis and comparison, one cannot learn anything; one must oppose taking a few words from Marxism-Leninism works to adorn one's bourgeois stance and viewpoint; one must oppose the liberal attitude of learning one thing and doing another.

Bourgeois intellectuals and bourgeois industrialists and businessmen must pay more attention to combining learning Chairman Mao's works with self-transformation. Someone asked me, can bourgeois elements learn Mao Zedong Thought? I answered him like this: see if he can combine with self-transformation, see if he can combine with changing his world outlook; if he can strive to learn and combine with his transformation, and combine well, he will definitely learn and gain something. The so-called combination with one's own transformation is to hit the target and be consistent in words and deeds. First, as mentioned earlier, one must implement Chairman Mao's instruction to combine with workers and peasants, learn from the masses, and serve the masses. Second, one must learn Chairman Mao's method of class analysis to dissect one's own thoughts, analyze one's own experiences, and replace the old with the new. Without these two points, it is very difficult to have a fundamental transformation in world outlook. At present, the new situation of socialist revolution and socialist construction in our country puts forward the need and possibility for the industrial and commercial circles, intellectual circles, and members of various democratic parties to learn Chairman Mao's works and transform their world outlook. We hope that everyone does not become a liberal who is inconsistent in words and deeds, but becomes an honest student of Chairman Mao.

Long-term coexistence and mutual supervision

The long-term coexistence and mutual supervision of the Communist Party and various democratic parties is an unshakable policy of our party.

Chairman Mao told us that the policy of long-term coexistence and mutual supervision is a product of our country's specific historical conditions. We must use the historical method to analyze the past, present, and future of various democratic parties to understand the reasons and conditions for various democratic parties to coexist and mutually supervise the Communist Party.

Most democratic parties were formed during the Anti-Japanese War. Their social base is mainly the national bourgeoisie, including the middle bourgeoisie, the upper petty bourgeoisie, and their intellectuals, as well as other patriotic elements with capitalist characteristics. Therefore, they are all bourgeois parties, whether in the past or present, they reflect the two-faced nature and political divisions of the national bourgeoisie in different specific historical conditions. In the past, that is, in the period of the new democratic revolution, because the national bourgeoisie was the intermediate class in Chinese society at that time, the democratic parties, in general, were also an intermediate political force. During the Anti-Japanese War, in the struggle between revolutionary forces and reactionary forces, they often took a neutral stance. After Japan's surrender, during the old Political Consultative Conference, they were the "third side"; in the early stages of the Liberation War, they took the "middle road" (also known as the "third way" or "third boat"). By the second half of 1947, the People's Liberation Army launched a strategic counteroffensive, pushing the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang to the brink of collapse, the "middle road" was practically bankrupt, and after a major debate and internal struggles between the left, middle, and right, the democratic parties began to turn to the side of the new democratic revolution, responding to our party's call on May 1, 1948, to convene a new Political Consultative Conference, and formally participated in the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference held in 1949. This was a historical turning point for the democratic parties and also the historical basis for the democratic parties to coexist and mutually supervise the Communist Party for a long time. In the second session of the first National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference held in June 1950, Chairman Mao declared: "War and land reform are the two 'tests' for all people and all parties in China in the historical period of the new democracy. As long as people make contributions in the revolutionary war and revolutionary land reform, and make contributions in the subsequent many years of economic and cultural construction, when the time comes to implement the nationalization of private industry and the socialization of agriculture, ... the people will not forget them, and their future is bright." Obviously, without this historical basis, there would be no long-term coexistence and mutual supervision.

In the current stage, that is, in the transitional period, our country is gradually realizing socialist revolution and socialist construction, and the classes and strata represented by various democratic parties are also undergoing profound socialist transformation. This revolution is fundamentally opposed to the class nature of various democratic parties, and they originally had no spiritual preparation for it. Therefore, various democratic parties in this revolution cannot but reflect the negative and reactionary aspects of the bourgeoisie and need to go through a serious struggle and painful transformation process. Especially in 1957, the rightist elements of various democratic parties became the backbone of the bourgeois rightists' rampant attacks, and the central and local organizations of various democratic parties were used by rightist elements as legal tools for anti-communist, anti-people, and anti-socialist activities, thus subjecting various democratic parties to a serious test in the anti-rightist struggle. However, in the past decade of class struggle, in general, various democratic parties, under the leadership of the Communist Party, have mainly represented the willingness of the national bourgeoisie to accept socialist transformation and have come along. This not only added an important stage to the historical basis for long-term coexistence but also laid a solid foundation for gradually realizing their fundamental transformation.

What is fundamental transformation? Comrade Liu Shaoqi, in his political report to the Eighth National Congress of the Party on behalf of the Central Committee of the Communist Party, said: "After the completion of socialist transformation, the members of the national bourgeoisie and the upper petty bourgeoisie will become part of the socialist laborers. Various democratic parties will then become the parties of this part of the laborers. Since the remnants of bourgeois ideology will linger for a long time in this part of the laborers, various democratic parties will need to continue to contact them, represent them, and help them transform for a long time." This transition from exploiters to socialist laborers, from bourgeois parties to parties of a part of socialist laborers, is the fundamental transformation.

Realizing this fundamental transformation is the decisive condition for various democratic parties to coexist and mutually supervise for a long time. The working class and the bourgeoisie, the Communist Party and bourgeois parties, cannot coexist for a long time. The bourgeoisie must be eliminated, and the bourgeois people must be transformed into laborers; this is the inevitable law of historical development. Various democratic parties must follow this historical law of development, actively help the bourgeois people gradually realize fundamental transformation, and thus gradually realize their own fundamental transformation. Rightists oppose fundamental transformation, which means they do not want long-term coexistence; it is either you eliminate me or I eliminate you. To want long-term coexistence, one must go against the way of the rightists and resolutely take the road of fundamental transformation. There is no other way.

Fundamental transformation is a process of rebirth and transformation, which cannot be without pain and shock. However, under the specific historical conditions of our country, realizing this transformation is possible. Over the past decade, various democratic parties have made significant progress through twists and turns and repeated class struggles in the socialist transformation process. With this foundation, as long as they seriously accept historical experience and lessons, raise awareness, and strengthen efforts, they can gradually reduce pain and shock and realize fundamental transformation more steadily in the future.

The key to the fundamental transformation of various democratic parties is to accept the leadership of the Communist Party.

"Follow Chairman Mao's words, follow the Communist Party, and walk the socialist road," this is the only truth proven by decades of historical experience. Chairman Mao said: "Summarizing our experience, concentrating on one point, is the leadership of the working class (through the Communist Party) based on the worker-peasant alliance's people's democratic dictatorship." (Note 29) Our people's democratic dictatorship is the combination of proletarian dictatorship and the people's democratic united front. It has the broad participation of various nationalities, democratic classes, democratic parties, and people's organizations, but only one leading class, which is the working class; only one leading party, which is the Communist Party; and only one guiding ideology, which is Marxism-Leninism, which is Mao Zedong Thought. This is the fundamental system and principle of our country. "The core force leading our cause is the Communist Party of China." (Note 30) Without the core leadership of the Communist Party, there is no people's cause. Summarizing the historical experience of various democratic parties, it also concentrates on this point, which is to accept the leadership of the Communist Party. In the past, relying on the leadership of the Communist Party, various democratic parties were able to take the new democratic road. Over the past decade, relying on the leadership of the Communist Party, various democratic parties have gradually taken the socialist road. In the future, only by relying on the leadership of the Communist Party can they realize fundamental transformation and realize long-term coexistence and mutual supervision with the Communist Party.

In this regard, the bourgeois rightists are good negative examples. The basic program of the rightists is to oppose the socialist road, oppose people's democratic dictatorship, and especially concentrate on opposing the leadership of the Communist Party. The leaders of the rightists were originally a group of ambitious people who always dreamed of taking the road of European and American democracy, that is, bourgeois dictatorship. During the War of Liberation, some wanted to divide the country into three parts, and some took the path of American imperialism. They came to the liberated areas to wait for the opportunity. They never truly acknowledged the leadership of the Communist Party and people's democratic dictatorship. In 1957, there were some international and domestic disturbances, and they took advantage of the policy of long-term coexistence and mutual supervision to incite opposition to the leadership of the Communist Party and took advantage of the policy of letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend to carry out large-scale criticism and denunciation against communism and socialism, thinking that this would cause the country to fall into chaos overnight and the Communist Party to collapse immediately, and they would have to come out to clean up the mess. The bourgeois rightists are reactionaries, and like all reactionaries, they are blinded by greed and cannot have a clear assessment of the situation, so they always end up hurting themselves. However, they are very clear and tight about the basic point that without the leadership of the Communist Party, there is no people's democratic dictatorship and no socialist road. On this basic point, we should learn from the rightists from the opposite side.

On this basic point, modern revisionists and bourgeois rightists are also in cahoots. They blur the line between bourgeois dictatorship and proletarian dictatorship, and interpret the existence and participation of various democratic parties in state power as the "parliamentary body of all the people" and "multi-party system" of a bourgeois state. This is, of course, complete nonsense and precisely what the bourgeois rightists demand. The fact is very clear: our people's democratic dictatorship is essentially proletarian dictatorship, and our state system is a form of proletarian dictatorship, which is fundamentally different from the parliamentary system and multi-party system of bourgeois states but is fundamentally the same as the state system principles of various socialist countries. Lenin said: "Proletarian dictatorship is a special form of class alliance of the vanguard of the laborers—the proletariat with the numerous non-proletarian laboring classes (petty bourgeoisie, small proprietors, peasants, intellectuals, etc.) or with the majority of them," (Note 31) as Comrade Liu Shaoqi pointed out: "The scope of the class alliance mentioned by Lenin can be different under different historical conditions, but proletarian dictatorship is always a certain form of class alliance, and this is undoubted." (Note 32) Our broadest united front not only does not harm our proletarian dictatorship and socialist cause but is precisely for consolidating and strengthening the proletarian dictatorship and socialist cause. Our united front policy is an extremely firm Marxism-Leninism class policy, which is to transform the national bourgeoisie and their intellectuals into socialist laborers and transform various democratic parties into the parties of this part of laborers, not to preserve the bourgeoisie and bourgeois parties.

Various democratic parties have done work, played an active role, and made contributions to the country and the people in the past. In the future, as long as they insist on accepting the leadership of the Communist Party, insist on fundamental transformation, and insist on the political line of serving socialism, without retreating, they will definitely be able to play a better active role. We believe that various democratic parties can do the following main tasks in the future:

1. Unite the people they represent and contact, continue to oppose domestic and foreign enemies, and oppose imperialism led by the United States. Our united front, in the past and present, has always been a united front against international imperialism and domestic reactionaries and is a great component of the international anti-imperialist united front. We should carry forward this glorious revolutionary tradition, continue to consolidate domestic unity, develop and consolidate the international anti-imperialist united front, and strive to defeat international imperialism and eliminate domestic reactionaries.

2. Unite and promote the people they represent and contact to take the socialist road and, together with the worker-peasant masses, participate in labor and practice, serve socialism. This not only contributes to the country's construction but is also a basic way to help people gradually realize fundamental transformation.

3. Promote the people they represent and contact to combine with the practice of serving socialism, develop self-education and self-transformation.

4. Assist the Party and the state in adjusting class relations. Over the past two or three years, mutual relations have greatly improved and are basically good; however, with the change of the situation, new problems are inevitable. For these contradictions within the people, we should take an active attitude and correctly handle them rather than avoid problems. If friends feel there are any problems, they can put forward their opinions and suggestions. In mutual relations, there are work relations and political treatment issues, as well as living issues, which should be appropriately arranged and handled under the premise of consolidating and strengthening the Party's leadership, according to each person's different situation, so that they can fully play an active role within the scope of their abilities.

5. Participate in the country's political life under the leadership of the Party.

6. Mutual supervision. Chairman Mao said: "The fact of mutual supervision among parties has long existed, that is, parties mutually give advice and make criticisms." "The opinions and criticisms given by various democratic parties to the Communist Party and vice versa can only play a positive role in mutual supervision under the condition of conforming to the six political standards we mentioned earlier." (Note 33)

We hope that various democratic parties can continue to progress on the basis of significant progress and better play this positive role.

Chairman Mao instructed us: "Our general task is: to unite the people of the whole country, to win the support of all international friends, to strive for the construction of a great socialist country, and to strive for the defense of international peace and the development of the cause of human progress." (Note 34)

Let us unite more closely on the basis of socialism and strive for the glorious and great cause of socialism.

Friends, comrades:

Now we are in the new era of proletarian socialist revolution, the era of the East Wind prevailing over the West Wind. The world is a new situation, China is a new situation, and the socialist transformation of the industrial and commercial circles, intellectual circles, and various democratic parties is also a new situation. To adapt to the new situation, we solemnly propose to various democratic parties, intellectual circles, and industrial and commercial circles to learn Chairman Mao's works and gradually transform their world outlook.

Wish the conference of various democratic parties a success!

Wish various democratic parties progress!

    学习毛主席著作，逐步改造世界观
　　（一九六○年八月十四日在中共中央统战部为六个民主党派的中央全会扩大会议所举行的报告会上的讲话）
　　李维汉
                大有进步
    近几年来，工商界大有进步，知识界大有进步，各民主党派大有进步。
    大有进步的主要表现何在？
      （一）在社会主义革命和社会主义建设继续发展和高涨的浪潮中，大多数人跟过来了，无论是比较自觉或者比较勉强，总是跟着过来了。
      （二）分别地说：在由资本主义立场到社会主义立场转变的过程中，（1）相当多的一部分人，即比以往较多的人，已经基本上转到社会主义立场，其中有些人比较稳定，有些人还有一定的动摇性。（2）相当多的一部分人，可能是比前一部分多一点的人，转到半社会主义立场。他们还带着相当大的动摇性，但是在这一段时间内也能摇摇摆摆地跟着走。（3）一小部分人还是基本上资本主义立场。他们又可分为两部分：一部分人主要是思想落后，经过教育和帮助，慢慢地可以进步；另一部分人，占极少数，是思想反动，他们在新的条件下也可能发生分化。
    此外，右派分子经过批判、孤立，又经过教育、帮助，在继续分化中，多数可能逐步改造过来。目前，有一些右派分子改得较好，根本不改的是少数。
      （三）各民主党派和工商联执行为社会主义服务的政治路线，执行自我教育和自我改造的方针，都有成绩，成绩都是主要的。
    总的说来，形势很好。
    大有进步是怎么得来的？
    大有进步之所以获得，第一，同1957年到1958年反右派斗争和整风运动的伟大胜利，即政治战线上和思想战线上的社会主义革命的伟大胜利，是分不开的。这一场革命斗争，对于资产阶级的人们和各民主党派说来，是他们在接受社会主义改造道路上的一个历史性的转折点。由于这个伟大的胜利，无论是工商界、知识界或者各民主党派的成员，在占多数地位的中间派当中，有很多人从不同程度地附和右派转到不同程度地向着社会主义，不同程度地愿意接受共产党的领导。由于这个伟大的胜利，各民主党派端正了政治路线，整顿了组织，改造了领导成份，从而为“逐步改造成为不是在名义上而是在实际上真正为社会主义服务的政治力量”（注一），打下了基础。
    大有进步之所以获得，第二，是同我国社会主义革命和社会主义建设的新的形势分不开的。两三年来，我国广大工人群众、农民群众和革命知识分子，在总路线、大跃进、人民公社三面红旗的光辉照耀之下，精神振奋，斗志昂扬，意气风发，干劲冲天，继续深入地发展了政治战线和思想战线上的革命，全面地展开了技术革命和文化革命，从而造成了社会主义革命和社会主义建设的新的高潮和新的形势。形势逼人，不想变也得变，不想跟也得跟，只得“上马下海”，或者叫做“逼上梁山”。
    大有进步之所以获得，第三，同执行以企业和工作岗位为基地，以劳动和实践为基础，以政治教育和思想教育为统帅的改造方针，是分不开的。1958年，在政治战线上和思想战线上的社会主义革命伟大胜利的基础之上，我们提出了这个新的方针。两三年来，在党的领导下，各有关方面，包括民主党派、工商联以及无党派民主人士的积极分子在内，大力地执行了这个方针，一方面，调动为社会主义服务的积极性，一方面，加强政治的、思想的教育（包括政治理论教育和时事政策教育），实行两条腿走路。多数工商业者和他们的家属走上了生产的和服务的劳动岗位，在从剥削者转化为自食其力的劳动者的道路上走了决定性的一步。多数知识分子在为社会主义、为工农服务中，经过参加生产实践，参加“三结合”等等，同工人和其他劳动人民一道工作和劳动，为知识分子工人化开辟了途径，并且有了良好的开端和初步的成就。经过生产斗争和政治的思想的教育，无论工商界、知识界或者各民主党派的成员，多数人对于劳动人民和工人阶级，对于共产党，在思想上和感情上比以前又靠拢了一步，同时，自我改造的积极性也逐渐增多了。各民主党派和工商联，在推动自己的成员为社会主义服务和向他们进行政治的、思想的教育方面，作出了显著的成绩，取得了相当丰富的经验，有不少基层组织，已经成了所在单位共产党组织的助手。
    大有进步之所以获得，第四，一切因素中的决定因素，是共产党和毛主席的领导。
    还有问题没有呢？
    有的。完整的估计应当是：大有进步，还有问题。
    什么问题？
      （一）不断革命，推动人们进步，又使人们感到跟不上。
  “跟不上”，已成为普遍的呼声。跟不上，很自然，但又是一个大问题。对这个问题，采取什么态度？可能有人采取消极态度，可能还有人对社会进步感到不高兴，这都是不好的。应当采取积极态度，努力跟上去。
      （二）多数人在政治立场改造方面还有不同程度的问题，又有一小部分人的立场基本上没有改变。
      （三）资产阶级的习惯势力，在很多人身上很少改变。
      （四）革命攻到意识形态的“尖端”上来了，实际生活日益迫切地提出了改变世界观的任务，即全面改造立场、观点和方法的任务。
    这些问题，实质上反映着工人阶级和资产阶级之间的两条道路的斗争。
              阶级斗争
    在过渡时期，人民民主统一战线的目的，是要完成社会主义革命和社会主义建设，消灭阶级，并且在将来逐步过渡到共产主义。我国的经验证明，要消灭阶级，不只要改变社会制度，还必须在政治上和思想上改造一切剥削者和小私有者。这是人类历史上空前伟大的一项任务。不实现这个任务，或者只有经济的改造而没有人的改造，就不能真正消灭阶级，就不能实现共产主义，无产阶级就不能获得最后的解放。这又是一项十分困难的任务，需要经过长期的、反复的、严重的阶级斗争。我们的经验又证明，经济战线上的改造还比较容易，真正困难的是人的改造，即政治上和思想上的改造。
      我们实现这个伟大而困难的任务，依靠强大的人民民主专政，采取民主和专政两种方法。对于人民外部，亦即统一战线外部的一切反动阶级和反动势力，实行专政，用暴力没收他们的财产，镇压他们的反抗，强迫他们在劳动中改造成为新人。这里所说的反动阶级和反动势力，在我国主要就是地主阶级、官僚资产阶级和其他反革命分子。地主阶级和官僚资产阶级在旧中国是两个主要的剥削阶级和统治阶级，历来是新民主主义革命的对象。对于这两个反动阶级和其他反革命分子，不实行专政是不行的。对于他们，决不能施仁政。对他们的仁慈，就是对人民的残忍（至今在某些土改和镇反不彻底的地方，他们
  还在为非作歹，残害人民）。这个问题，在统一战线中常常引起争论，而我们总是不让步，就因为这是一个原则问题。列宁说过，承认不承认无产阶级专政，是测验是否真正了解和承认马克思主义的试金石。所以，要不要无产阶级专政，要不要对
  反动阶级和反革命分子采用镇压手段的问题，历来是马克思主
  义者和修正主义者进行斗争的一个根本问题。老修正主义者讲什么“一般民主”，现代修正主义者大谈特谈“人道主义”，他们都不讲对敌人的镇压，都背叛了无产阶级革命和无产阶级专政的学说。我们必须同修正主义划清界限。
    对于统一战线内部，即人民内部的一切阶级、阶层，包括民族资产阶级在内，则实行民主。我们对民族资产阶级的改造，一般采用民主的即团结、批评、教育的方法，也就是和平的方法，这是因为民族资产阶级有两面性。对于民族资产阶级的两面性，毛主席作了科学的分析。在民主革命时期，民族资产阶级有革命性的一面，又有妥协性的一面。在社会主义革命时期，民族资产阶级有拥护宪法、愿意接受社会主义改造的一面，又有剥削工人阶级、走资本主义道路的一面。所以民族资产阶级和官僚资产阶级不同。官僚资产阶级即大资产阶级，是中国的垄断资产阶级，占有全国工商业资本的80％。他们是国际帝国主义的走狗，是中国反革命统治中占主要地位的阶级，两只手都拿着血淋淋的刀，人民只能以刀对刀，把它砍倒，再用脚踏上。对于他们，不可能有什么和平改造或者和平过渡。
    有人问：既然这样，为什么中国共产党在抗日战争时期要同以蒋介石为代表的官僚资产阶级合作，在抗日战争结束以后又同他们讲和平、民主呢？在抗日战争时期，中国同日本帝国主义的矛盾上升为主要矛盾，我国国内阶级矛盾和我国同英、美帝国主义的矛盾都降到次要的服从的地位，而在英、美同日本帝国主义之间，英美派大资产阶级同亲日派大资产阶级之间，则扩大了矛盾的裂口，这就使代表英美派大资产阶级的蒋介石集团，在国内人民抗日力量的压迫下，不得不在一定程度上参加抗日。在这种情况下，利用英、美帝国主义以及英美派大资产阶级同日本帝国主义之间的矛盾，对于实现抗战和争取抗战胜利是有重要作用的。如果我们不去利用这种矛盾，联合蒋介石集团抗日，当然是不对的。但是，就在那时，这部分大资产阶级也仍然是很反动的，他们是抗日民族统一战线中消极抗日、积极反共的顽固派。抗日战争初期，在我们党内，曾经发生了第二次王明路线的投降主义，不依靠人民抗战而幻想依靠国民党抗战，不赞成共产党在抗日民族统一战线中实行独立自主政策，以争取无产阶级领导权，而主张一切经过蒋介石国民党，把领导权让给大资产阶级。我们党在以毛主席为首的中央的领导下，坚决地反对和克服了这种投降主义，坚持了统一战线下的独立自主的政策，坚持了发展进步势力、争取中间势力、孤立顽固势力的方针。根据这些方针、政策，我们放手发展敌后抗日人民武装和抗日民主根据地；对于国民党顽固派的政治压迫和武装进攻，则根据以斗争求团结的原则，坚决地进行了针锋相对而又有理、有利、有节的斗争，在军事上，人不犯我，我不犯人，人若犯我，我必犯人，并且坚决、彻底、全部、干净地消灭之。由于坚持并且贯彻执行了这一系列的方针、政策，我们党逐步地孤立了大资产阶级顽固派，紧紧地掌握了抗日民族统一战线和抗日战争的领导权，把抗日战争引导到最后胜利，并且为尔后人民解放战争的胜利准备了决定性的条件。日本投降之后，全国人民迫切要求和平、民主，而美帝国主义和蒋介石则采取和平欺骗政策，作为准备内战、笼络人心、孤立我们党的手段。我们党洞悉美蒋这种奸计，一方面积极准备以革命战争反对反革命战争，另一方面代表全国人民的愿望，发动和领导全国人民进行争取和平、民主的斗争。在后一方面，即在争取和平、民主的斗争方面，我们主要依靠群众运动，利用一切可能，去影响和发动国民党统治区的人民群众进行斗争；同时同国民党进行谈判，在不损害人民根本利益的条件下，给国民党以必要的让步，同它达成了基本上有利于人民的停战协定和政治协议。谈判是另一种形式下的斗争，特别是国民党背着人民一步一步撕毁协议的时候，我们坚持地把谈判进行到底，以便彻底揭露美蒋假和平、真内战的阴谋，借以教育广大人民。由于采取了上述正确的路线和政策，使得蒋介石集团在正式撕毁协议、全面发动内战的时候，就完全陷于孤立，而我们党则在政治上、军事上都立于不败之地。同1927年相比，出现了完全不同的局面。1927年，陈独秀右倾机会主义者对国民党实行投降主义的路线和政策，只团结不斗争，对于蒋介石的反革命的突然袭击毫无精神准备，使革命遭到惨痛的失败。这一次，由于我们准备了两手，就是既准备了和平的政治斗争的一手，又准备了和平被破坏后的武装斗争的另一手，而不是只准备了一手，我们就不但没有遭受损失，而且迅速地打败了美帝国主义和蒋介石，取得了革命的胜利。
    在长期的新民主主义革命中，锻炼出了一个马克思列宁主义的以毛主席为领袖的中国共产党，一个由党领导的强大的人民军队，一个由党领导的以工农联盟为基础的包括民族资产阶级在内的广泛的统一战线。依靠这三个法宝，我们打倒了中国革命的三大敌人和国民党反动统治，建立了强大的人民民主专政，保证我国能够通过和平道路逐步实现社会主义革命。民族资产阶级主要是中等的和小的资本主义成份，只占整个资本主义经济的20％左右，是一个经济上软弱的、因此政治上带有两面性的阶级；在新民主主义革命中，一般说来，他们常常采取中立的或者参加的态度。在第一次国内革命战争时期，民族资产阶级参加了共产党领导的统一战线。在1927年到1931年，他们附和过反革命，但是基本上没有掌握过政权，而受到当权的大地主、大资产阶级的迫害和限制。抗日战争时期以来，民族资产阶级又参加了共产党领导的统一战线。最后，在解放战争后期，他们终于转到人民革命这方面来。解放以后，民族资产阶级不再是中间阶级，他们和工人阶级的矛盾成为我们国内的主要矛盾。但是，民族资产阶级继续留在人民民主统一战线之内，表示继续接受共产党的领导，因此，有在人民民主专政之下接受社会主义改造的可能。在革命发展的具体历史条件下，民族资产阶级原有的两面性，也发展和转化成为社会主义革命时期的新的两面性，“工人阶级同民族资产阶级的矛盾属于人民内部的矛盾。工人阶级和民族资产阶级的阶级斗争一般地属于人民内部的阶级斗争”（注二），可以用和平的方法，即团结、批评、教育的方法来解决。不论民主革命时期，或者社会主义革命时期，民族资产阶级都有两面性；而民族资产阶级所以能够在工人阶级领导之下，从逐步参加新民主主义革命进到逐步接受社会主义改造，则是因为他们的两面性包含有积极性的一面。忽视他们的这一面，把他们和官僚资产阶级看成一样，就要犯“左”倾机会主义的错误。
    但是，民族资产阶级的两面性，如前所述，还有消极的、反动的一面。因此，工人阶级和民族资产阶级之间，不论过去或者现在，都充满着阶级斗争。在过渡时期，这两个阶级之间的斗争，就是社会主义道路和资本主义道路谁胜谁负的斗争。社会主义就是消灭剥削制度和剥削阶级，这当然是同民族资产阶级的本性相反的。任何剥削阶级及其阶层和集团，包括民族资产阶级在内，不管它多么开明、“明智”，也不管它是多大多小，不经过斗争，总是不肯退出历史舞台的。我国民族资产阶级虽然没有掌握过政权，但是掌握了一部分现代企业和现代文化技术知识，并且领导过旧民主主义革命，有过反帝爱国的历史，在社会上本来有相当广泛的经济联系和政治、思想影响。他们就仗恃这些东西作为向工人阶级进行斗争的资本。同时，帝国主义和国内被打倒了的反动阶级，把复辟的希望寄托于民族资产阶级，寄托于“民主个人主义终于会再显身手”（注三）；这又成为民族资产阶级中某些上层反动分子进行阶级斗争的后援。所以，我们决不可忽视民族资产阶级消极的、反动的一面。谁要是忽视了这一面，就要犯右倾机会主义或者修正主义的错误。
    由于中国具体历史条件形成的民族资产阶级的上述两面性，这一方面决定了和平改造的可能性，另一方面又决定了和平改造只能是阶级斗争在一种特殊形式下的继续。我国十多年来的经验证明，工人阶级正确地利用对民族资产阶级进行和平改造的可能性，是有利于人民，有利于社会主义的。我国的经验更其证明，要实现和平改造，首先必须工人阶级掌握着强大的国家机器。中国工人阶级经过几十年的武装斗争，最后夺取了政权，建立了强大的人民民主专政，所以不怕民族资产阶级造反，而有力量用和平的方法对他们进行社会主义改造。人民革命战争的胜利，和由这个胜利建立起来的强大的人民民主专政，这是实现和平改造的根本前提。没有人民革命战争的胜利，就没有、也不可能有人民民主专政；而没有人民民主专政，当然就没有、也不可能有任何和平改造。由此很明白，我国对民族资产阶级的和平改造，同不经过暴力革命夺取政权的“和平过渡”，是完全不相干的。
    中国工人阶级在取得了国家政权以后，以很高的速度发展了社会主义的强大优势，根据我国的经验看来，这是推动民族资产阶级逐步接受社会主义改造的一个基本条件。随着解放战争的全面胜利，我们没收了掌握国家经济命脉的全部官僚资本，并且把它改造成为国营社会主义经济，成为对民族资本和个体经济实行社会主义改造的物质力量。此后，稳定物价、抗美援朝、土地制度改革、镇压反革命、思想改造、三反五反等广大人民群众斗争的胜利，国营经济的发展，农业合作化高潮的到来，都一步一步地推动着民族资产阶级，使他们不得不逐步走上接受社会主义改造的道路，并终于在1956年出现了全面公私合营的高潮。反右派斗争和整风运动之后，六亿人民热气腾腾，干劲冲天，“过去的剥削阶级完全陷落在劳动群众的汪洋大海中，他们不想变也得变”（注四），因而出现了参加劳动和为社会主义服务的高潮。资本主义日益消灭，社会主义的大势日益逼人，资产阶级的人们这才一步一步地接受社会主义改造。离开社会主义的优势，不去发展这种优势，而指望资产阶级的人们自发地、自动地走社会主义道路，如果不是出于幼稚的幻想，就是对于马克思列宁主义的嘲笑。现在技术革命和文化革命全面展开，工人阶级知识分子队伍空前发展，在这种形势面前，有些资产阶级知识分子又会感到孤立，我看这也不是什么坏事，而是好事。只要人们采取正确的态度，这种情况，决不会把他们引向后退和没落，而定会把他们引向进步和光明。
    我们党的团结——斗争——团结的政策，是引导和推动民族资产阶级逐步接受社会主义改造的另一个基本条件。这是我们党正确处理工人阶级和民族资产阶级之间的关系的基本政策，也就是工人阶级和民族资产阶级进行阶级斗争的基本方法。这个政策和方法，就是有团结，有斗争，从团结出发进行斗争，团结是斗争的目的，斗争是达到团结的手段。总的说来，“为了改造，先要团结”（注五）；至于某一时期、某一方面，团结为主，还是斗争为主，这要取决于具体情况。有团结，有斗争，主要就是要发动他们参加反对国内外敌人的斗争；发挥他们在社会主义建设中的积极作用，鼓励他们接受社会主义改造的积极性，一边倒，奔一头；适当照顾他们的合理利益——经济赎买，政治安排，包下来，包到底；帮助他们进行学习，对他们的错误进行批评、教育。团结和斗争是不能分开的，批评是我们进行斗争的主要武器。十多年来，用这个武器，我们同民族资产阶级进行了几次由他们挑起来的激烈的大斗争，更对他们进行了大量的经常性的教育工作。对于民族资产阶级说来，接受社会主义改造是同他们的本性相违反的，因此当然是被动的。但是，由于我们党贯彻执行了团结——斗争——团结的政策，就逐步地启发和促进了他们的自觉自愿，使他们的多数人在总的被动中一步一步地在不同程度上由被动转为主动，不太勉强地接受了社会主义改造。
    十多年来，工人阶级和民族资产阶级之间的阶级斗争，是在经济战线、政治战线和思想战线上逐步展开的。在经济战线上，经过国民经济的恢复，经过三反五反的严重斗争，经过几年的利用、限制、改造，尤其是经过国家资本主义由低级形式到高级形式的发展，我们在1956年基本上完成了所有制方面的改造。但是所有制改造的基本完成，并没有结束阶级斗争，而是使阶级斗争转向深入发展，在政治战线和思想战线上展开和反映出来。资产阶级虽然失去了企业，但是对共产党和工人阶级并不心服，他们中的右派分子则决心起来进行一场较量。因此，就出现了1957年的右派进攻和接之而起的反右派斗争和整风运动。大家知道，反右派斗争和整风运动是一个政治战线和思想战线上的伟大的社会主义革命，是社会主义道路和资本主义道路之间一场决定性的战斗。这场战斗证明，单有经济战线上的社会主义革命是不够的，并且是不巩固的；必须还有一个政治战线上思想战线上的彻底的社会主义革命。1959年党内右倾机会主义分子又代表资本主义复辟的愿望向党进攻，再一次证明了毛主席指明的这个真理。这场战斗又证明，民族资产阶级的多数人以至大多数人是能够逐步地接受社会主义改造的，在这样的情况下，他们同工人阶级的矛盾属于人民内部的矛盾。但是，因为这是一种特殊的人民内部矛盾，并且是采取和平改造的方法来处理的，需要经过长期的斗争过程，才能达到解决矛盾的目的。在这个斗争中，必然有一小部分不甘心资本
  主义制度和资产阶级死亡的分子，要起来进行坚决的反抗。这
  些分子就是资产阶级右派。不难设想，他们手中如果掌握了武装，也会像西藏的反动农奴主那样，举行反革命的武装叛乱。他们同人民的矛盾是你死我活的敌我矛盾。必须对这些右派分子进行彻底的揭露和批判，才有利于资产阶级的多数人在接受社会主义改造的道路上继续前进，而不向后倒退。
      现在，阶级斗争还在进行，而且还需要继续一个很长的时间。只要资产阶级还存在，资产阶级的政治影响和思想影响还存在，资产阶级和小资产阶级的习惯势力还存在，阶级斗争就不会熄灭。
    阶级斗争的发展是复杂的，曲折的，反复的，并且像波浪起伏一样，高一阵，低一阵。过去十年，曾经出现过几次大的浪头。今后，总的说来，无产阶级必然愈斗愈强，资产阶级必然愈斗愈分化、削弱，终至消灭。但是，这种趋势，仍然要经过多次反复的斗争来实现。小的反复是一定不可避免的，在某种条件下出现大反复、大浪头，也是可能的。阶级斗争的大浪头有时是在国际和国内条件的配合下发生的。例如1957年夏季阶级斗争的大风浪，就是在匈牙利事件以后国际反苏反共浪潮和国内革命深入发展中，由资产阶级右派掀起来的。现在，国际帝国主义正在利用现代修正主义散布对于帝国主义的恐惧和幻想，分裂世界人民的团结；而民族资产阶级至今仍是我国人民中间最容易动摇的一部分人，在国内社会主义革命继续深入的情况下，有些人感到修正主义适合他们的口味，对各色各样的修正主义有兴趣。因此，我们在团结工商界、知识界和各民主党派进行反对帝国主义斗争的同时，在他们当中进行反对修正主义的教育和学习，帮助他们认清修正主义的本质，同修正主义划清界限，记取1957年的教训，从而在可能发生的风浪中站稳脚跟，避免被修正主义引入危险的泥坑，这是目前阶级斗争中的一项重要任务。
    在不断革命的过程中，阶级斗争有时比较紧张，有时比较缓和，是不可避免的，并且合乎规律的。资产阶级的人们感到阶级斗争紧张，一种是由于反抗革命、进攻工人阶级造成的（如三反五反和反右派斗争）；一种是由于跟不上。这是两种不同的情况。我们应当区别这两类情况，区别反社会主义分子和比较落后的人们。对于一切愿意跟而有些跟不上的人们，不应当瞧不起、嫌麻烦，而应当关心他们，研究他们的困难和问题，积极地、耐心地帮助他们。毛主席指示我们：“共产党员对于落后的人们的态度，不是轻视他们，看不起他们，而是亲近他们，团结他们，说服他们，鼓励他们前进。”（注六）我们必须采取这种态度。
              改造世界观
    改造世界观，就是要抛弃资产阶级世界观，树立无产阶级世界观。
    我们国家，正处在社会主义革命和社会主义建设的新的高潮中和新的形势下，各个战线上都突出了兴无灭资的思想斗争，两条道路的斗争突出地反映为兴无产阶级思想、灭资产阶级思想，破资产阶级世界观、立无产阶级世界观的斗争。毛主席说，“无产阶级要按照自己的世界观改造世界，资产阶级也要按照自己的世界观改造世界。在这一方面，社会主义和资本主义之间谁胜谁负的问题还没有真正解决。”（注七）现在，广大劳动群众正在兴起一个学习毛主席著作的热潮。可以肯定，这个学习的持续和发展，将决定这个谁胜谁负的问题，并且为工商界、知识界和各民主党派成员改变世界观造成有利的形势。
    世界观，就是观察和处理事物的立场、观点和方法。无产阶级用无产阶级的立场、观点和方法来观察和处理事物，资产阶级用资产阶级的立场、观点和方法来观察和处理事物。这两个世界观的矛盾和斗争，是不能调和，也不应当调和的。无产阶级世界观即辩证唯物主义和历史唯物主义，是关于自然、社会和思维的一般规律的正确反映，是唯一科学的世界观。无产阶级和共产党可以而且应当同有资产阶级世界观的人们和有神论者结成一定的政治上的统一战线，并且力求扩大这种统一战线，团结一切可以团结的人。我国的人民民主统一战线，在过渡时期，就是以毛主席提出的六条政治标准作为基础，广泛地团结了全国人民，共同实行社会主义革命，建设社会主义。但是在统一战线当中，无产阶级思想和资产阶级思想之间，无产阶级世界观和资产阶级世界观之间，无神论和有神论之间，只能划清界限，决不可调和，决不许混淆。如果以为既然要在政治上结成统一战线，就可以不在思想上划清界限，甚至混淆这种界限，那便犯了原则错误。在我们党内，这就是右的错误。反过来，如果以为既然要划清思想界限，就可以放弃政治上的统一战线，不以六条政治标准为基础去团结一切可以团结的人，那也犯了原则错误。在我们党内，这就是“左”的错误。
      社会主义革命和社会主义建设的过程，就是按照无产阶级世界观来改造世界的过程，在这里面，有些人感到很难受，很不舒服，以至发生各种各样的消极、抵触情绪。在我们看来，这归根到底就是因为世界观有问题。采取反对态度，固然是世界观不对头；所谓跟不上，在思想上主要也是从世界观不对头而来的。所以，对于他们，改变世界观就成了迫切的任务。
    把世界观改变过来，对社会主义革命和社会主义建设就会有热情和干劲，就能跟上。把世界观改变过来，就不但能够跟上形势的发展，而且可能预见形势的发展，不管中国和世界上刮什么政治台风，也就能站稳脚跟，不容易动摇了。不改变世界观，必然有危险，经不住大风浪。
    在这次几个民主党派的会议中，议论了“知识私有”、“我字当头”和“知识分子架子”等问题。所有这些东西及其他相类似的东西，归根到底都是资产阶级世界观下面的东西。资产阶级知识分子本来是用工人和农民的劳动果实培养出来的，他们的知识本来也是从工人农民的实践经验中总结出来的。可是他们一旦掌握了知识，就把它当作私人资本，要求“一本万利”，只为剥削阶级服务，而不为工农劳动人民服务，并且否认工人农民的实践是知识的源泉，轻视工人农民的实践经验，对于工农劳动人民反而摆出一副臭架子来。这岂不是忘了本，岂不是头脚颠倒了？这不是资产阶级世界观又是什么呢？
    改造世界观，就是要把这种头脚颠倒的现象改变过来。毛主席很早就指出，知识分子要为工农服务，要同工农结合，要走工人化的道路。“革命的或不革命的或反革命的知识分子的最后的分界，看其是否愿意并且实行和工农民众相结合。”毛主席并且指出这是“唯一的标准”（注八）。现在，我们国家所采取的知识分子参加劳动的方法，“三结合”的方法和其他有关的方法，为知识分子和工农结合，“逐步工人阶级化”（注九），开辟了广阔的途径。两三年来，许多人同工农一道为社会主义服务，开始踏上了工人化的道路，他们的世界观有了一定程度的改变，他们的知识也从实践中得到一定的校正和改造，并且有所丰富。这是很好的现象。资产阶级知识分子的知识，有一部分是对于社会主义建设有用的，是国家的一笔财富，需要保留和发展；又有一部分是无用的，甚至是有害的，应当抛弃。所以对待资产阶级知识分子的知识，需要经过具体的分析和批判，取其精华，去其糟粕。同工农群众相结合，通过革命实践和生产实践，是改造世界观和实现工人化的必由之路，也是鉴别知识，改造知识和发展有用知识的必由之路。资产阶级知识分子应当走这条路，资产阶级工商业者也应当走这条路，并且都要不断地走下去。
    有些自然科学工作者认为，从事自然科学的人，天然是辩证唯物主义者，不需要改造世界观。我看事情不是这样。诚然，资产阶级自然科学工作者，如果认真地以科学的态度，从事科学技术的实践，那么，在某种范围内，他们可能具有自发的唯物的、辩证的成份，否则，他们的科学技术活动就不会取得成功。但是整个地和根本地说来，他们的思想体系是资产阶级的；尤其在社会生活领域内，由于他们是为资产阶级服务的，他们就更是浸透了资产阶级世界观。因此，他们的科学技术活动因为得不到正确的世界观的指导，不得不在暗中摸索；而且他们只要一走出那个狭小的活动范围，就必然被唯心主义和形而上学所支配。解放以来，经过学习、实践，许多人有了不同程度的进步，但是应当承认，对于多数人来说，这个问题还远没有解决。还有一些人认为，知识分子比资本家清高，不应当同资本家相提并论。我看事情也不是这样。资产阶级知识分子一般不占有生产资料，不直接剥削工人，在这一点上，是同资本家有区别的。但是，他们同资本家一样，原来是靠资本主义吃饭的。在旧中国，有帝国主义经济，封建主义经济，官僚资本主义经济，民族资本主义经济，个体经济，知识分子只能靠这五种经济吃饭，为这五种经济服务。资产阶级知识分子，就是主要靠资本主义经济吃饭、为资本主义经济服务的知识分子，他们和资本家是同一阶级的两个部分，在阶级本质上是一样的。所以，不论是资本家或者资产阶级知识分子，也不论是从事社会科学或者自然科学，都要进行社会主义的根本改造，都要破除资产阶级世界观，树立无产阶级世界观。在我国革命的历史发展中，无产阶级世界观早已在社会科学方面取得了领导地位；现在正在自然科学方面取得领导地位。今后我国政治革命、思想革命、技术革命、文化革命的全面展开和深入发展，不但要在社会科学方面，而且要在自然科学方面，破除资产阶级世界观，树立无产阶级世界观。这是一定的，必然的，不可阻挡的。我们希望，知识界的朋友们能够顺应这个历史发展规律，努力改造自己的世界观。
    有人把立场和观点、方法分裂开来，或者对立起来，认为既然提出改造世界观问题，那就是立场改造问题已经解决了。这是一种误解。立场、观点和方法是统一的，不可分割的，而且阶级立场问题总是首要的和基本的问题。1957年我们强调改造立场，因为当时资本主义所有制基本上改变了，我国社会发展的规律，要求资产阶级的人们在政治上改变阶级立场，而右派进攻正好暴露了资产阶级立场的反动本质，突出了立场问题，所以我们不能不大吼一声：资产阶级立场是反动的，必须改造。在批判右派的时候，我们着重地集中地揭露了他们的反动立场，同时也揭露了他们的“攻其一点，不及其余”的反动方法。经过反右派斗争和整风运动，又经过两三年来政治战线上和思想战线上的社会主义革命的深入发展，技术革命和文化革命的全面展开，如前所述，对于思想改造需要全面地提出改造立场、观点、方法的要求。人们的错误观点，除了来源于阶级立场以外，还来源于思想认识或者思想方法。正确的立场和正确的思想方法，是统一的，不可分离的，二者缺一，就不可能有正确的观点。立场问题在任何时候都是首要的和基本的问题，人们的思想认识或者思想方法也是由人们的立场决定的。但是思想认识或者思想方法又可以转过来影响立场。所以，思想认识或者思想方法的改造，不应当和立场改造互相对立，而应当和立场改造互相促进。
    世界观的改变需要很长的时间和很大的努力。不论工商界、知识界或者各民主党派成员，都应当按照毛主席的指示：“在自己的工作和学习的过程中，逐步地树立共产主义的世界观，逐步地学好马克思列宁主义，逐步地同工人农民打成一片，而不要中途停顿，更不要向后倒退，倒退是没有出路的。”（注十）适当的批评和自我批评，是必要的。旧的东西不经过批判是不能改变的。无产阶级世界观要求人们对自己的知识和认识经常采取批判的态度。因为认识乃是对于客观事物的反映，它总是后于客观事物的发展的。任何人如果不对自己的知识和认识采取批判的态度，就不可能正确地反映和认识客观，就看不见新鲜事物，而落在时代的后面。但是，改造世界观只能逐步进行，不能性急，欲速则不达。在这个问题上，我们必须耐心地细致地做工作。“思想斗争同其他的斗争不同，它不能采取粗暴的强制的方法，只能用细致的讲理的方法。”（注十一）有些人一时改变不了，也可以有所等待，同时积极而又耐心地帮助他们。在改变世界观的问题上，耐心是必要的，某种等待也是必要的。此外，“事实上必定会有一些人在思想上始终不愿意接受马克思列宁主义，不愿意接受共产主义，对于这一部分人不要苛求；只要他们服从国家的要求，从事正常的劳动，我们就应当给他们以适当工作的机会。”（注十二）
            学习毛主席著作
    学习马克思列宁主义，必须学习毛主席著作。改变世界观，必须学习毛主席著作。
    这里，讲一点个人的体会。
    学习毛主席著作，就是学习毛泽东思想。毛泽东思想是在马克思列宁主义普遍真理同中国革命和建设的实践相结合中形成和发展起来的，是在反对右倾机会主义、“左”倾机会主义和反对现代修正主义的斗争中成长和发展起来的。四十年来，毛主席在革命实践和理论工作中，从各方面保卫了马克思列宁主义，发展了马克思列宁主义，领导中国革命从一个胜利走向一个胜利，并且给世界上一切为争取解放和光明而斗争的广大人民，提供光辉的范例和锐利的武器。毛泽东思想是无产阶级社会主义革命时代全面发展了的马克思列宁主义。
    理论和实践相结合，包括能动地认识世界和能动地改造世界这两个方面。马克思说：“不是人们的意识决定人们的存在，而是人们的社会存在决定人们的意识。”他又说：“从来的哲学家只是各式各样地说明世界，但是重要的乃在于改造世界。”（注十三）毛主席在引了马克思的这两句话以后指出：“这是自有人类历史以来第一次正确地解决意识和存在关系问题的科学的规定，而为后来列宁所深刻地发挥了的能动的革命的反映论之基本的观点。”（注十四）我的理解，毛主席在这里所说的，就是要我们从实践中能动地认识社会和自然，发现其规律，然后又运用所发现的规律，经过实践，能动地改造社会和自然。换一句话说，就是要我们从实践到理论，又从理论到实践，如此反复不已地把理论和实践结合起来，不断地认识世界，不断地改造世界，“而实践和认识之每一循环的内容，都比较地进到了高一级的程度。”（注十五）这个实践——理论——实践的过程，也就是毛主席所说的从群众中来，到群众中去的过程。群众是历史的创造者，我们的理论从根本上说都是群众斗争经验的总结，并且是为群众斗争服务的。要参加群众斗争，向群众学习，从群众中取得原料，经过加工，化为理论以及政策、计划、方案、意见等等东西，又到群众中去宣传，和群众一道加以实践，加以考验。然后再从群众中集中起来，再到群众中坚持下去，这样循环不已。任何英雄好汉，如果脱离了群众的实践，就断了知识的源泉，就不可能能动地认识世界，不可能能动地改造世界。
    毛主席反复教导我们，必须努力于马克思列宁主义理论和中国革命实践的“统一的理解”（注十六），“必须将马克思主义的普遍真理和中国革命的具体实践完全地恰当地统一起来，就是说，和民族的特点相结合，经过一定的民族形式，才有用处，决不能主观地公式地应用它。”（注十七）人们常说创造性地运用马克思列宁主义。什么是创造性？我看，像毛主席所说的，把马克思列宁主义普遍真理和革命具体实践结合起来，并且力求完全地恰当地结合起来，就有创造性。实践不仅是理论的标准，同时是理论的源泉。人类历史上新的理论总是在新的实践中产生的。理论一经和实践完全地恰当地结合起来，就必然在新的实践中得到丰富和发展。“只有善于根据自己的民族特点运用马克思列宁主义的普遍真理，各国无产阶级的事业才能得到成功。而且只要他们这样做，他们就会创造出自己的新的经验，从而给别的民族和整个马克思列宁主义宝库作出一定的贡献。”（注十八）毛主席在革命斗争和理论工作中把马克思列宁主义普遍真理和革命具体实践完全地恰当地结合起来，并且长期地不断地这样作，数十年如一日地这样作，所以从各方面发展了马克思列宁主义，并且继续发展着马克思列宁主义，给我们作出了创造性地运用和发展马克思列宁主义的光辉榜样。
    学习毛主席著作，必须运用理论和实践相结合的方法，采取毛主席在“改造我们的学习”里面所指示的有的放矢的态度和实事求是的态度。有的放矢和实事求是，就是要以马克思列宁主义的普遍真理作为指导，来具体地分析具体事物，找出具体事物固有的发展规律，用来指导实践，把认识世界和改造世界统一起来。
    毛主席向来教导我们，世界是统一的，又是多样性的，世界上没有不能分析的事物，只是一情况不同，二性质不同。世界上一切事物都是矛盾的统一。“矛盾存在于一切过程中，并贯串于一切过程的始终，矛盾即是运动，即是事物，即是过程，也即是思想。否认事物的矛盾就是否认了一切。这是共通的道理，古今中外，概莫能外。”（注十九）我们观察事物，不能脱离普遍真理即矛盾发展的共通的规律，否则就会坐井观天，见树不见林，迷失方向，所以我们必须找马克思列宁主义这根“矢”。但是，“矛盾的普遍性即寓于矛盾的特殊性之中。”（注二十）
  “成为我们认识事物的基础的东西，则是必须注意它的特殊点，就是说，注意它和其他运动形式的质的区别。只有注意了这一点，才有可能区别事物。任何运动形式，其内部都包含着本身特殊的矛盾。这种特殊的矛盾，就构成一事物区别于他事物的特殊的本质。这就是世界上诸种事物所以有千差万别的内在的原因，或者叫做根据。”（注二十一）在一事物和他事物之间，在一事物的不同发展阶段之间，在一事物的矛盾诸方面之间，都各有特点；所以我们不能把事物看成铁板一块，而要对具体事物作具体的分析。无论研究学问，处理工作，从提出问题到解决问题，都要进行调查研究，并且要进行周密的系统的调查研究。在分析和研究具体事物的时候，尤其要注意找出主要矛盾和主要的矛盾方面，因为：“对于矛盾的各种不平衡情况的研究，对于主要的矛盾和非主要的矛盾、主要的矛盾方面和非主要的矛盾方面的研究，成为革命政党正确地决定其政治上和军事上的战略战术方针的重要方法之一，是一切共产党人都应当注意的。”（注二十二）我们找马克思列宁主义的普遍真理这根“矢”，不是为着别的，正是为着指导我们具体地分析事物，求出规律，解决矛盾。毛主席常常引列宁的话要我们懂得：
  “马克思主义的最本质的东西，马克思主义的活的灵魂，就在于具体地分析具体的情况。”（注二十三）就是这个道理。
    有的放矢，实事求是，理论和实践相结合，也就是一般和特殊相结合。毛主席指示我们，人类的认识运动，总是首先由特殊到一般，即首先在实践中认识了许多不同事物的特殊的本质（具体规律），再进一步加以概括，认识诸种事物的共同本质（普遍规律）。然后，再以这种共同本质或者普遍规律为指导，继续向各种没有研究过的具体事物进行研究，找出其特殊本质或者特殊规律，指导我们的实践。所以，由实践到理论、又由理论到实践的过程，可以理解为由特殊到一般，又由一般到特殊的过程。
    这个分析事物矛盾的方法，运用到社会上来，最根本的就是阶级分析的方法。毛主席指导中国革命的理论和策略，始终是以按照马克思列宁主义分析中国各阶级和帝国主义国家的阶级为基础的。
    总之，理论和实践相结合，从群众中来，到群众中去，对具体事物的具体分析，是马克思列宁主义世界观的核心。要改变世界观，必须学习把握这个核心。
    只有理论和实践结合，才是真正革命的，才有革命的彻底性。毛主席在论共产主义和三民主义的区别的时候，这样说：
  “共产主义者是理论和实践一致的，即有革命彻底性。三民主义者除了那些最忠实于革命和真理的人们之外，是理论和实践不一致的，讲的和做的互相矛盾，即没有革命彻底性。”（注二十四）毛主席又说：“没有科学的态度，即没有马克思列宁主义的理论和实践统一的态度，就叫做没有党性，或叫做党性不完全。”（注二十五）
    反对右倾机会主义或者修正主义，反对“左”倾机会主义或者教条主义，是保证马克思列宁主义普遍真理和革命实践相结合的必不可少的条件。毛主席在中国革命运动中，对右倾机会主义和“左”倾机会主义进行了彻底的斗争，从而把马克思列宁主义的普遍真理同中国革命的具体实践完全地恰当地结合起来。教条主义者从左边来割断革命理论和革命实践的联系，他们是无产阶级队伍里的一个思想派别，但是沾染了小资产阶级的狂热观点，他们的意志是革命的，但是“他们拒绝对于具体事物做任何艰苦的研究工作，他们把一般真理看成是凭空出现的东西，把它变成为人们所不能够捉摸的纯粹抽象的公式”
  （注二十六），脱离了实践，脱离了群众，常常走到冒险主义，所以不可能是真正的或者完全的革命彻底性。修正主义者从右边来割断革命理论和革命实践的联系，他们屈服于资产阶级的影响和帝国主义的威胁，“借口创造性地发展马克思列宁主义，而否认马克思列宁主义的普遍真理的意义。”（注二十七）
  “借口民族特点而脱离马克思列宁主义关于社会主义革命和社会主义建设的普遍真理。”（注二十八）。他们每每为了眼前的暂时的蝇头小利，丢掉无产阶级的根本的长远的利益，因而丧失了革命性，不要群众的革命斗争。他们也在那里反对“教条主义”，但是他们所反对的，正是马克思列宁主义的最根本的东西。中国的革命经验证明，在同资产阶级结成统一战线的时候，右倾机会主义或者修正主义就成为主要危险。修正主义者总是无视或者忘记农民是革命主力，工农联盟是基础，武装斗争是革命的主要形式，无视或者忘记无产阶级和共产党领导的决定作用，无视或者忘记资产阶级的动摇性和反动性，而把希望寄托于资产阶级以至大资产阶级，不向他们争夺领导权而把领导权让给他们。现代修正主义者也是一样，他们在争取和平、民主、民族独立和社会主义的斗争中，总是无视或者忘记只有人民的革命斗争才是取得胜利的决定因素，而幻想统治人民的资产阶级以至帝国主义者会改变本性，因此，他们只谈和平和和平过渡，而不要准备以暴力革命反对暴力反革命，以革命战争反对反革命战争的另一手。
    用理论和实践相结合的方法来学习毛主席著作，也必须运用分析的方法，不要囫囵吞枣，背诵词句。不经过分析和比较，是学不到东西的；必须反对断章取义，曲解马克思列宁主义的实质，从马克思列宁主义著作中抓几个词句，用来装点自己的资产阶级的立场和观点；必须反对学的是一回事、行的是一回事的自由主义态度。
    资产阶级知识分子和资产阶级工商业者学习毛主席著作，更须注意同自我改造结合起来。有人问我，资产阶级分子能不能学到毛泽东思想？我这样答复他：看他能不能同自我改造相结合，能不能同改变自己的世界观相结合；如果能够努力学习，能够结合自己的改造，并且结合得比较好，就一定能够学而有得。所谓结合自己的改造，就是要有的放矢，言行一致。首先，如同前面讲过的，要贯彻执行毛主席指示的同工农结合的方针，向群众学习，为群众服务。第二，要学习毛主席阶级分析的方法，用来解剖自己的思想，分析自己的经历，破旧立新。没有这两条，要在世界观上来一个基本的转变是很困难的。目前，我国社会主义革命和社会主义建设的新形势，向工商界、知识界和各民主党派成员提出了努力学习毛主席著作、改造世界观的需要，同时也提供了学习毛主席著作、改造世界观的可能和条件。希望我们大家不做一个言行不一致的自由主义者，而做一个毛主席的老实学生。
        长期共存、互相监督
    共产党和各民主党派长期共存、互相监督，是我们党的既定不移的方针。
    毛主席告诉我们，长期共存、互相监督这个方针，是我国具体的历史条件的产物。我们必须用历史的方法，分析各民主党派的过去、现在和未来，才能弄清楚各民主党派能够和共产党长期共存、互相监督的道理和条件。
    各民主党派大多数是抗日战争期间形成的。它们的社会基础主要是民族资产阶级，包括中等资产阶级、上层小资产阶级和他们的知识分子，以及其他带有资本主义色彩的爱国分子。因此，它们都是资产阶级性的党派，不论过去或者现在，都在不同的具体历史条件下反映着民族资产阶级的两面性及其政治分野。在过去，即在新民主主义革命时期，因为民族资产阶级在当时是我国社会的中间阶级，各民主党派在政治上，总的说来，也就是一种中间政治力量。在抗日战争期间，在革命势力和顽固势力的斗争中，它们往往采取中立态度。在日本投降后，在旧政协期间，它们是“第三方面”；在解放战争初期，它们是走“中间路线”（又叫作“第三条道路”或者“第三条船”）。到1947年下半年，人民解放军转入战略反攻，把国民党反动统治的那条船推向复灭，“中间路线”实际上破产了，又经过一场大辩论，并且经过它们内部的左、中、右的斗争，各民主党派开始转到新民主主义这方面来，响应了我们党1948年5月1日提出的召开新政治协商会议的号召，并且正式参加了1949年召开的中国人民政治协商会议。这是各民主党派的一个历史转折点，也就是各民主党派能够和共产党长期共存、互相监督的历史基础。毛主席在1950年6月中国人民政治协商会议第一届全国委员会的第二次会议上宣告过：“战争和土改是在新民主主义的历史时期内考验全中国一切人们、一切党派的两个‘关’。……只要人们在革命战争中，在革命的土地制度改革中有了贡献，又在今后多年的经济建设和文化建设中有所贡献，等到将来实行私营工业国有化和农业社会化的时候，……人民是不会把他们忘记的，他们的前途是光明的。”显然，没有这个历史的基础，就不会有长期共存、互相监督。
    在现阶段，即在过渡时期，我们的国家在逐步实现社会主义革命和社会主义建设，各民主党派所代表的阶级和阶层也在经历着深刻的社会主义改造。这个革命是同各民主党派的阶级本性根本相反的，它们原来不可能有任何精神准备。因此，各民主党派在这个革命中，不可能不反映资产阶级的消极的、反动的一面，而需要经历一个严重斗争和痛苦改造的过程。尤其是1957年，各民主党派的右派分子充当了资产阶级右派猖狂进攻的骨干，各民主党派中央和地方的许多组织被右派分子利用来作为反共反人民反社会主义的合法工具，因而使各民主党派在反右派斗争中受到严重的考验。但是，在十多年来的阶级斗争的大风浪中，总的说来，各民主党派在共产党的领导下，主要代表了民族资产阶级愿意接受社会主义改造的一面，跟着走过来了。这就不仅给长期共存的历史基础增加了重要的阶段，而且为逐步实现它们的根本改造，打下了可靠的基础。
    什么是根本改造？刘少奇同志在1956年代表中共中央向党的第八次全国代表大会所作的政治报告中说：“在社会主义改造完成以后，民族资产阶级和上层小资产阶级的成员将变成社会主义的劳动者的一部分。各民主党派就将变成这部分劳动者的政党。由于在这部分劳动者中，资产阶级思想的残余还会拖得很长，各民主党派还需要在一个很长的时间内继续联系他们，代表他们，并且帮助他们改造。”这个由剥削者到社会主义劳动者，由资产阶级性政党到一部分社会主义劳动者的政党的过渡，就是根本的改造。
    实现这个根本改造，是各民主党派能够长期共存、互相监督的决定条件。工人阶级和资产阶级，共产党和资产阶级性政党，不可能长期共存。资产阶级一定要消灭，资产阶级的人们一定要改造成为劳动者，这是历史发展的必然规律。各民主党派必须循着这个历史规律前进，积极地帮助资产阶级的人们逐步实现根本改造，从而也逐步地实现自己的根本改造。右派分子反对根本改造，也就是不要长期共存，不是你消灭我，就是我消灭你。要想长期共存，就要反右派之道而行，决心走根本改造的道路。其他的道路是没有的。
    根本改造是一个脱胎换骨的过程，不可能没有痛苦和震动。但是，在我国的具体的历史条件下，实现这个改造是可能的。各民主党派十多年来经过曲折、反复的阶级斗争，已经在社会主义改造的道路上大有进步。有了这个基础，只要认真地接受历史的经验和教训，提高自觉，加强努力，今后就有可能逐步减少痛苦和震动，而比较平稳地实现根本改造。
    各民主党派实现根本改造，关键在于接受共产党的领导。
  “听毛主席的话，跟共产党走，走社会主义道路”，这是几十年历史经验所证明了的唯一真理。毛主席说：“总结我们的经验，集中到一点，就是工人阶级（经过共产党）领导的以工农联盟为基础的人民民主专政”。（注二十九）我国的人民民主专政，是无产阶级专政和人民民主统一战线相结合。它有各民族、各民主阶级、各民主党派、各人民团体的广泛参加，但是只有一个领导阶级，就是工人阶级；只有一个领导党，就是共产党；只有一个指导思想，就是马克思列宁主义，就是毛泽东思想。这是我国立国的根本制度和根本原则。“领导我们事业的核心力量是中国共产党。”（注三十）离开了共产党的核心领导，就没有人民的事业。总结各民主党派的历史经验，同样地集中到这一点，就是接受共产党的领导。过去，靠了共产党的领导，各民主党派才能走上新民主主义的道路。十多年来，靠了共产党的领导，各民主党派才能逐步走上社会主义的道路。今后，只有靠共产党的领导，才能实现根本改造，实现同共产党长期共存、互相监督。
    在这一点上，资产阶级右派是很好的反面教员。右派的基本纲领就是反对社会主义道路，反对人民民主专政，尤其集中于反对共产党领导。右派的头子们原来就是一批野心分子，他们历来幻想走欧美民主即资产阶级专政的道路，在解放战争期间，有些人要搞“三分天下”，有些人走美帝国主义的门路。他们到解放区来，是为了等待时机。他们从来没有真心承认共产党的领导和人民民主专政。1957年，国际国内有些风吹草动，他们就利用长期共存、互相监督的方针，进行反对共产党领导的煽动，又利用百花齐放、百家争鸣的方针，实行反共反社会主义的大鸣大放，以为这样一来，天下顷刻大乱，共产党马上完蛋，不得不请他们出来收拾残局。资产阶级右派是反动派，他们和一切反动派一样，利令智昏，对时局不可能有清醒的估计，所以他们总是搬起石头打自己的脚。但是，他们对于没有共产党的领导就没有人民民主专政，就没有社会主义道路，这样一个基本点，是看得很准，抓得很紧的。在这个基本点上，我们应当从反面向右派分子学习。
    在这个基本点上，现代修正主义者和资产阶级右派也是一鼻孔出气的。他们模糊资产阶级专政和无产阶级专政的界限，把我国各民主党派的存在和参加国家政权，曲解为资产阶级国家的“全民代议机关”和“多党制度”。这当然完全是胡说，并且正是资产阶级右派所要求的东西。事实很明白，我们的人民民主专政实质上是无产阶级专政，我们的国家制度是无产阶级专政的一种形式，它同资产阶级国家的代议制和多党制根本相反，而同各社会主义国家的国家制度原则上相同。列宁说过：“无产阶级专政是劳动者的先锋队——无产阶级同人数众多的非无产阶级的劳动阶层（小资产阶级、小业主、农民、知识分子等等）或同他们的大多数结成的特种形式的阶级联盟”，（注三十一）正如刘少奇同志所指出的：“列宁所说的阶级联盟的范围，在不同的历史条件下是可以不一样的，但是，无产阶级专政总是一定形式的阶级联盟，这一点是无可怀疑的。”（注三十二）我国最广泛的统一战线不但不损害我们的无产阶级专政和社会主义事业，而且正是为着巩固和加强无产阶级专政和社会主义事业。我们的统一战线政策是一个极其坚定的马克思列宁主义的阶级政策，它是为着把民族资产阶级及其知识分子改造成为社会主义的劳动者，把各民主党派改造成为这一部分劳动者的政党，而不是为着保存资产阶级和资产阶级性的政党。
    各民主党派过去做了工作，起了积极作用，对国家和人民作了贡献。今后，只要坚持接受共产党的领导，坚持根本改造，坚持为社会主义服务的政治路线，而不向后倒退，就一定可以更好地发挥积极作用。我们认为，各民主党派今后可以在下列几个主要方面进行工作：
      （一）团结所代表和联系的人们，继续反对国内外敌人，反对以美国为首的帝国主义。我们的统一战线，过去和现在都是反对国际帝国主义和国内反动分子的统一战线，而且都是整个国际反帝统一战线的一个伟大的组成部分。我们应当发扬这个光荣的革命传统，继续巩固国内的团结，发展和巩固国际反帝统一战线，为战胜国际帝国主义和肃清国内反动分子而进行艰巨的斗争。
      （二）团结和推动所代表和联系的人们走社会主义道路，和工农群众一道，参加劳动和实践，为社会主义服务。这不但可以为国家的建设作出贡献，而且是帮助人们逐步实现根本改造的基本途径。
      （三）推动所代表和联系的人们结合为社会主义服务的实践，发展自我教育和自我改造。
      （四）协助党和国家调整阶级关系。两三年来，相互关系有很大改进，基本上是好的；但是随着情况的变化，不可避免地会有新的问题。对于这种人民内部的矛盾，我们应当采取积极的态度，正确地加以处理，而不应当回避问题。朋友们如果感觉到有什么问题，可以提出自己的看法和建议。在相互关系中，有工作关系问题和政治待遇方面的问题，也有生活方面的问题，都应当在巩固和加强党的领导的前提下，按照各人的不同情况，作适当的安排和处理，以利于他们在力能胜任的范围内，充分发挥积极作用。
      （五）在党的领导下，参加国家的政治生活。
      （六）互相监督。毛主席说：“各党派互相监督的事实，也早已存在，就是各党派互相提意见，作批评。”“各民主党派和共产党相互之间所提的意见，所作的批评，也只有在合乎我们在前面所说的六条政治标准的情况下，才能够发挥互相监督的积极作用。”（注三十三）
    我们希望各民主党派在大有进步的基础上继续前进，更好地发挥这种积极作用。
    毛主席指示我们，“我们的总任务是：团结全国人民，争取一切国际朋友的支援，为了建设一个伟大的社会主义国家而奋斗，为了保卫国际和平和发展人类进步事业而奋斗。”（注三十四）
    让我们在社会主义的基础上更进一步地团结起来，为着光荣伟大的社会主义事业而奋斗。
      朋友们，同志们：
    现在我们正处在无产阶级社会主义革命的新时代，东风压倒西风的新时代。世界是新形势，中国是新形势，工商界、知识界和各民主党派的社会主义改造也是新的形势。为了适应新的形势，我们郑重地向各民主党派、知识界和工商界提出学习毛主席著作、逐步改造世界观的建议。
    祝各民主党派的会议成功！
      祝各民主党派进步！
