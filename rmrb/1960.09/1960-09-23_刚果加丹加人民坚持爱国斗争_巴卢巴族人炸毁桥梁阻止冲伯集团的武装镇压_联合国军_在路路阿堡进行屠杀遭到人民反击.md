Xinhua News Agency, September 22nd dispatch from Elisabethville: The people of Katanga Province, Congo, continue to wage a patriotic struggle to safeguard national independence and unity, despite the blatant interference of the "UN Forces" and the bloody suppression by the Tshombe and other puppet cliques.

It is reported that a portion of the Baluba people who initiated an armed struggle in Manono, northern Katanga Province, have carried automatic weapons and traveled by truck to the Mwenge area southeast of Manono, near Northern Rhodesia, preparing to launch a new struggle there. On the 19th, they blew up two bridges near Lake Mweru to prevent armed suppression by Tshombe's reactionary police force.

In Albertville, a crucial stronghold in northeastern Katanga Province, the people have recently launched a struggle against the Tshombe reactionary clique.

A Congolese government force that was suppressing the Kalonji secessionist clique in Kasai Province severely struck a Kalonji reactionary army on the 20th in the Luputa area. This army, emboldened by the "UN Forces", attempted a counterattack. According to reports, a Kalonji reactionary army attempted to join its main force but was ambushed and completely annihilated. Some Belgian soldiers were among this reactionary army.

It is reported that in the area near Luluabourg, the capital of Kasai Province, the Congolese people are increasingly dissatisfied with the "UN Forces'" protection of colonialists and interference in Congolese internal affairs. The "UN Forces," repeatedly touted by UN Secretary-General Hammarskjöld as "peacekeeping forces," opened fire twice on the 16th and 20th, carrying out bloody suppression of the people. The heroic Congolese people retaliated against the atrocities of the "UN Forces."

Meanwhile, in Léopoldville, the capital of Congo, although Mobutu, who launched the coup, brazenly sent troops into the government building on the 20th, driving out officials of the legitimate government, these officials calmly returned to their offices on the 21st and began working as usual at 8 a.m.

According to reports, under these circumstances, Mobutu went so far as to dispatch rebel troops wearing steel helmets, riding in armored vehicles, and carrying heavy machine guns to forcibly occupy the government building and Léopoldville Radio one hour later. The "Commissioner Committee" appointed by Kasavubu also entered the government building.

On the evening of the 21st, Mobutu clamored for the withdrawal of the Guinean and Ghanaian troops participating in the "UN Forces." His excuse was that these two forces had protected Congolese Prime Minister Lumumba. On the same day, some Ghanaian troops guarding Lumumba's residence were replaced by Sudanese troops participating in the "UN Forces." (Attached picture)

    新华社22日讯　伊利沙伯维尔消息：加丹加省人民不顾“联合国军”的蛮横干涉和冲伯等傀儡集团的血腥镇压，继续展开维护民族独立和统一的爱国斗争。
    据报道，曾在加丹加省北部马诺诺发起武装斗争的一部分巴卢巴族人，已携带着自动武器，乘着卡车进入了马诺诺东南靠近北罗得西亚的姆温格地区，准备在那里展开新的斗争。他们在19日曾炸毁了姆韦鲁湖附近的两座桥，阻止冲伯反动警察部队的武装镇压。
    在加丹加省东北重要据点阿尔伯特维尔，人民最近也掀起了反对冲伯反动集团的斗争。
    在开赛省讨伐卡隆吉分裂集团的一支刚果政府军，20日曾在卢普塔地区狠狠地打击了在“联合国军”纵容下企图反扑的卡隆吉反动军队。有消息说，一支卡隆吉反动军队企图同它的主力部队汇合，遭到伏击，全军覆灭。在这支反动军队中，有一些比利时军人。
    据报道，在开赛省省会路路阿堡附近地区，刚果人民对“联合国军”包庇殖民者和干涉刚果内政的行为愈来愈表示不满。曾被联合国秘书长哈马舍尔德一再宣扬为“和平部队”的“联合国军”，竟在16日和20日两次开枪，对人民进行血腥镇压。英勇的刚果人民对“联合国军”的暴行进行了反击。
    与此同时，在刚果首都利奥波德维尔，虽然发动政变的蒙博托20日悍然派兵进入政府大厦，赶走合法政府的官员，但是这些官员21日仍然镇静地来到他们的办公室，在上午八时开始照常工作。
    据报道，在这种情况下，蒙博托竟然派出头戴钢盔、乘坐装甲车、带着重机枪的叛军在一小时后武装占领了政府大厦和利奥波德维尔电台。由卡萨武布任命的“专员委员会”也随即进入政府大厦。
    21日晚，蒙博托又叫嚣要参加“联合国军”的几内亚部队和加纳部队撤出。他的借口是，这两支部队保护了刚果政府总理卢蒙巴。同一天，某些守卫卢蒙巴住所的加纳部队已由参加“联合国军”的苏丹部队所代替。（附图片）
