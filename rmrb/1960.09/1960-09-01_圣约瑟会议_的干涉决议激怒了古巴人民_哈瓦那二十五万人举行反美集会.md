Xinhua News Agency, Havana, August 30th. The Cuban capital saw a grand anti-U.S. rally this afternoon in front of the Presidential Palace, with 250,000 people warmly welcoming Foreign Minister Roa upon his return from the Organization of American States foreign ministers' meeting. During the rally, twelve Cuban Air Force planes flew over the capital, patrolling the coast to guard against possible aggression from the north. Roa and his entourage arrived back in Havana from Costa Rica at 1:30 PM today. Upon hearing the news of Roa's arrival, people from all walks of life, including workers, militiamen, and students, spontaneously went to the Presidential Palace, gathering there to welcome the minister. The crowd angrily shouted slogans such as "Down with U.S. Imperialism" and "Swear to Defend the Motherland," strongly protesting the U.S.'s forcing of the foreign ministers' meeting to pass a resolution interfering in Cuba.

In his speech to the welcoming crowd, Roa said, "Cuba will never again be a satellite of U.S. imperialism. We are now and will remain friends with those who treat us kindly, and enemies of those who try to oppress us by force." He said, "We have established economic and diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union and other socialist countries. Regardless of the Monroe Doctrine, the Organization of American States, the State Department, and the monopoly groups represented by Eisenhower and Herter, we will continue this relationship."

Roa condemned the so-called "Declaration of San José" forcibly passed by the foreign ministers' meeting as a thoroughly servile document. He said that the United States had to employ various pressures, conspiracies, and foolish methods to force the passage of this declaration.

Roa emphasized that Cuba's example is the aspiration of Latin America. Cuba's path is the path of underdeveloped countries. He said that imperialism believes they can build a dam to block the advance of the tide, but those who try to block this tide will be submerged by the revolutionary tide. Because when a nation can resist all obstacles, it is invincible.

Cuban Prime Minister Castro, who participated in the rally, also spoke to the crowd. He revealed that the Cuban delegation moved its return from Costa Rica forward because enemies of the revolution, instigated by U.S. imperialism, attempted to use two fighter planes based in Guatemala to intercept and shoot down the plane carrying the Cuban delegation on its way home. When talking about the future of the Cuban revolution in the face of the threat of U.S. imperialism, Castro said with confidence, "The future will belong to us." He said, "All of the Americas will be free. What is happening in Cuba will one day happen throughout Latin America." He said, "Let them accuse us of setting an example. We are proud to have set an example."

In order to prevent the conspiracy of counter-revolutionaries and imperialists colluding to intercept the plane, Roa and his party safely returned to Havana five hours ahead of schedule today.

Xinhua News Agency, Havana, August 30th. Cuban Prime Minister Castro strongly condemned this morning the United States' attempt to use the Organization of American States foreign ministers' meeting, which ended on the 29th in San José, to isolate and further invade Cuba.

Prime Minister Castro said that the United States went to Costa Rica to attend the foreign ministers' meeting with a bag full of millions of dollars in one hand and a club in the other. He pointed out that the United States used bribery and pressure to force this meeting to pass a resolution against Cuba. However, the United States manipulating the meeting is one thing, manipulating the people is quite another. He said that U.S. imperialists cannot take away the Latin American peoples' fraternal friendship with the Cuban people, who are fighting against imperialism, the common enemy of the Latin American peoples.

Castro made these remarks at the solemn graduation ceremony of 1,500 volunteer teachers who will undertake the task of educating farmers. These volunteer teachers completed their studies in the Sierra Maestra mountains.

Castro pointed out that this foreign ministers' meeting was a meeting between sharks and sardines. The United States' intention was to hope that Cuba would reject the aid of the Soviet people so that Cuba would be isolated, and then the United States, this shark, would devour Cuba. He said that the Cuban revolutionary government is not prepared to fall into this trap. Castro said that the Pentagon announced during the San José foreign ministers' meeting that its troops, paratroopers, and marines were ready to execute orders to take action. This is extremely shameless. He said that Cuba has the right to buy weapons from countries that support it. The current task of the Cuban people is: "Strengthen ourselves, defend ourselves in the trenches, and arm ourselves to the teeth." He said: The task of the Cuban people is to prepare and to raise our slogans "Swear to Defend the Motherland" and "We Will Win" even louder. We will win because justice is on our side.

Castro said that U.S. imperialism can never thwart the Cuban revolution, which is invincible. The resistance to U.S. imperialism was first started in Latin America by Cuba. No one doubts that more and more countries will rise up to resist foreign oppressors. He said that the peoples of various countries have learned from Cuba that only by resisting can one be respected.

Castro then condemned the United States' banditry around the world. He said, "Who said the world belongs to the Yankees? The United States does interfere all over the world. Now, the Yankees are interfering in Korea and Turkey. In Taiwan, its fleet is there to protect the Chiang Kai-shek puppet. Its bases are all over the world."

Castro criticized the actions of representatives of certain Latin American countries in succumbing to U.S. pressure at this meeting. He also pointed out that when the United States threatened Cuba, the representatives of Latin American countries did not condemn the United States. In this regard, he mentioned the demonstration held by the people of the Venezuelan capital on the 29th to condemn the United States and protest the perfidy in Costa Rica. He said that the Venezuelan people are heroic anti-imperialist people friendly to Cuba. He emphasized that the peoples of Latin American countries want land reform, nationalization of foreign enterprises, sovereignty, freedom, culture, and welfare, and they hope to do what the Cuban people have already done.

Castro called on the Cuban people to hold a massive rally in Havana's Civic Square on September 2 to show U.S. imperialism their unwavering will to defend the motherland. He said, "We will answer the San José Declaration with the Cuban people's declaration." Prime Minister Castro also called on the fraternal peoples of Latin American countries to give the Cuban revolution further and greatest support. He said that the Cuban revolution will continue to fight to defend the interests of the peoples of the Americas.

The volunteer teachers, militiamen, workers, students, and people from other walks of life participating in the rally continuously cheered Prime Minister Castro and shouted in unison: "With or without the Organization of American States, we will definitely win this struggle!" "We will win!" "Cuba, yes! Yankees, no!"

Xinhua News Agency, Havana, August 31st. The Executive Bureau of the National Committee of the Cuban People's Socialist Party published a communiqué in "Hoy" today, condemning the United States for forcing the Organization of American States foreign ministers' meeting to pass a resolution interfering in Cuba, and called on the Cuban people to strengthen their unity to fight back against the provocations of U.S. imperialism. The communiqué said that the Organization of American States passed a resolution interfering in Cuba because this organization "is only a tool for U.S. imperialism to impose its will, its policies, and its decisions on Latin American countries."

The communiqué pointed out that the United States, as the master of the Organization of American States, forcibly passed a resolution against Cuba, but the vote of the Organization of American States is not the vote of Latin America. The communiqué emphasized that "Cuba's unyielding and firm stance at the meeting gave our country a victory. Cuba exposed the role played by imperialism and the despicable behavior of the Organization of American States, thereby enhancing our country's prestige in Latin America and the world."

The communiqué said that the Executive Bureau believes that "objective circumstances require us to strengthen our vigilance against the enemy's activities, because imperialism will definitely double its counter-revolutionary activities." The communiqué pointed out that national defense should be strengthened and the militia should be developed. In general, the four key points of revolutionary activities identified by the People's Socialist Party at its recent Eighth National Congress should be implemented: unity, production, defense, and awareness.

The Executive Bureau called on all political organizations and trade unions, peasant, and student organizations to unite more closely and participate in the grand people's rally scheduled to be held on September 2 to counter the provocations of the imperialist aggressors.

    “圣约瑟会议”的干涉决议激怒了古巴人民
    哈瓦那二十五万人举行反美集会
    卡斯特罗说美帝国主义决不能挫败古巴革命
    古巴人民社会党号召人民团结起来回击美帝国主义挑衅
    新华社哈瓦那30日电　古巴首都二十五万人今天下午在总统府前面举行了盛大的反美集会，热烈欢迎刚参加美洲国家组织外长会议回来的外交部长罗亚。在举行集会时，古巴空军的十二架飞机在首都上空飞行，在沿海巡逻，提防可能从北方发动的侵略。罗亚和随行人员是在今天下午一时三十分从哥斯达黎加返抵哈瓦那的。在得悉罗亚到达的消息之后，各阶层的人民，包括工人、民兵和学生，自发地走到总统府，聚集在那里欢迎这位部长。群众愤怒地高呼“打倒美帝国主义”和“誓死保卫祖国”的口号，强烈抗议美国强使外长会议通过干涉古巴的决议。
    罗亚在向欢迎他的群众集会上发表的讲话中说，“古巴已经永远不再是美帝国主义的卫星了。我们现在是、将来仍然是友好地对待我们的人的朋友，也是那些企图强力压迫我们的人的敌人。”他说，“我们已经同苏联和其他社会主义国家建立了经济和外交关系。不管门罗主义也好，美洲国家组织和国务院也好，以及以艾森豪威尔和赫脱为代表的垄断集团也好，我们将继续这种关系。”
    罗亚谴责外长会议强行通过的所谓“圣约瑟宣言”是一个彻头彻尾的奴隶性的文件。他说，美国在强使通过这项宣言时不得不采用了各种压力、阴谋和愚蠢的手法。
    罗亚强调指出，古巴的榜样是拉丁美洲的愿望。古巴的道路是不发达国家的道路。他说，帝国主义认为，他们能够筑起阻挡潮流前进的堤坝，但是，企图阻挡这种潮流的人将被革命的潮流淹没。因为，当一国人民能够抵抗一切障碍时，它就是不可战胜的。
    参加集会的古巴总理卡斯特罗也向群众讲了话。他揭露说，古巴代表团提前了从哥斯达黎加回国的时间，这是因为受美帝国主义怂恿的革命的敌人企图利用在危地马拉基地上的两架战斗机在半途中拦截和击落古巴代表团回国时所乘坐的飞机。卡斯特罗在谈到在美帝国主义的威胁面前古巴革命的前途时充满信心地说，“前途必将属于我们。”他说，“全美洲都将获得自由。在古巴发生的一切，终有一天也将在全拉丁美洲发生。”他说，
  “让他们为我们做出的榜样而指控我们吧。我们因为做出了榜样而感到骄傲。”
    为了预防反革命分子和帝国主义勾结截击座机的阴谋，罗亚一行今天提前五小时安全回到哈瓦那。
    新华社哈瓦那30日电　古巴总理卡斯特罗今天清晨强烈谴责美国企图利用29日在圣约瑟结束的美洲国家组织成员国外长会议来孤立和进一步侵略古巴。
    卡斯特罗总理说，美国是一手拿着装满千百万美元的钱袋、一手拿着棍棒前往哥斯达黎加参加外长会议的。他指出，美国用贿赂和压力强使这次会议通过反对古巴的决议。但是，美国操纵会议是一回事，操纵人民却完全是另一回事。他说，美帝国主义者是不能够夺去拉丁美洲各国人民对古巴人民的兄弟情谊的，古巴人民正在为反对拉丁美洲人民的共同敌人帝国主义而斗争。
    卡斯特罗是在一千五百名志愿教师的隆重的毕业典礼上讲这番话的，这批将担负起教育农民的任务的志愿教师在马埃斯特腊山区结束了他们的学习。
    卡斯特罗指出，这次外长会议是鲨鱼和沙丁鱼之间的会议。美国的企图是：希望古巴拒绝苏联人民的援助，以便使古巴陷于孤立，于是美国这条鲨鱼就来吞噬古巴。他说，古巴革命政府并不准备落进这个圈套。卡斯特罗说，五角大楼在圣约瑟外长会议期间宣布，它的军队、伞兵、海军陆战队已经准备好执行采取行动的命令。这是极端无耻的。他说，古巴有权利从支持它的国家购买武器。古巴人民当前的任务是：“加强自己，防守在战壕中和把自己武装到牙齿”。他说：古巴人民的任务是进行准备，并更加响亮地提出我们的“誓死保卫祖国”和“我们必胜”的口号。我们必胜，是因为正义在我们这一边。
    卡斯特罗说，美帝国主义决不能挫败古巴革命，古巴革命是不可战胜的。对美帝国主义的反抗是古巴首先在拉丁美洲开始的。任何人也不怀疑，愈来愈多的国家的人民也将起来反抗外国压迫者。他说，各国人民已经从古巴那儿认识到，只有进行反抗才能受到尊重。
    卡斯特罗接着谴责美国在世界各地的强盗行径。他说，“谁说过世界是属于美国佬的？美国的确干涉着世界各地。现在，美国佬干涉着朝鲜和土耳其。在台湾，它的舰队在那里保卫着蒋介石傀儡。它的基地遍布世界各地。”
    卡斯特罗批评了某些拉丁美洲国家的代表在这次会议上屈从美国压力的做法。他还指出，当美国威胁古巴的时候，拉丁美洲国家的代表并没有谴责美国。在这方面，他提到委内瑞拉首都人民29日为谴责美国和抗议在哥斯达黎加的背信弃义的行为而举行的示威。他说，委内瑞拉人民是英勇反帝的、同古巴友好的人民。他强调说，拉丁美洲各国人民要土地改革、把外国企业收归国有、主权、自由、文化和福利，他们希望做古巴人民已经做过的事。
    卡斯特罗号召古巴人民于9月2日在哈瓦那的西维卡广场举行大规模集会，向美帝国主义显示他们保卫祖国的不可动摇的意志。他说，
  “我们将用古巴人民的宣言来回答圣约瑟宣言”。卡斯特罗总理还呼吁拉丁美洲各国的兄弟人民给予古巴革命以进一步的最大的支持。他说，古巴革命将为保卫美洲各国人民的利益继续斗争。
    参加这次集会的志愿教师、民兵、工人、学生和其它各阶层人民不断向卡斯特罗总理欢呼，并且齐声高呼：“有美洲国家组织也好，没有它也好，我们一定会在这场斗争中取得胜利！”“我们必胜！”“要古巴，不要美国佬！”
    新华社哈瓦那31日电　古巴人民社会党全国委员会执行局今天在“今日报”上发表了一项公报，谴责美国强使美洲国家组织外长会议通过干涉古巴的决议，并且号召古巴人民加强团结来回击美帝国主义的挑衅。公报说，美洲国家组织通过干涉古巴的决议，是因为这个组织“只是美帝国主义把它的意志、它的政策和它的决定强加给拉丁美洲各国的一个工具。”
    公报指出，美国作为美洲国家组织的主人强行通过了反对古巴的决议，但是美洲国家组织的投票并不是拉丁美洲的投票。公报强调指出，“古巴在会议上采取的不屈的坚定立场使我国获得了胜利。古巴揭露了帝国主义所扮演的角色和美洲国家组织的卑鄙行为，从而在拉丁美洲和全世界提高了我国的威信。”
    公报说，执行局认为，“客观环境要求我们加强对敌人活动的警惕性，因为帝国主义肯定要加倍地进行它的反革命活动。”公报指出，目前应该加强国防，发展民兵。总的来说，应该实行人民社会党最近在它的全国第八次代表大会上所确定的革命活动的四个重点：团结，生产，国防和觉悟。
    执行局号召一切政治组织和工会、农民、学生组织更加紧密地团结起来，参加预定在9月2日召开的盛大的人民大会，反击帝国主义侵略者的挑衅。
