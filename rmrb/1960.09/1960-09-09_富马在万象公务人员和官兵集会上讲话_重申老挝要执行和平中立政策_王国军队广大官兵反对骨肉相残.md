Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, September 8th: Vientiane Radio broadcast today that Laotian Prime Minister Prince Phouma, speaking at a rally of over 10,000 civil servants and officers in Vientiane on September 6th, said that the policy of peace and neutrality is the policy he and the Laotian people desire. The Laotian people, hoping to achieve tranquility and true peaceful neutrality, recently rose up to carry out a coup. He said that this policy had begun to be implemented four years ago and continued until the end of 1957. He only went abroad to rest after the former Lao Fighting Forces participated in the country's common life.

Phouma then said that before going abroad, he had asked friends in the Lao People's Union Party to govern the country according to his policies. However, the development of the situation was not satisfactory, and subsequent governments changed many key points of his policies.

Phouma said that Laos is a small country and must be truly neutral. During his time as prime minister, he visited the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, the People's Republic of China, South Vietnam, Taiwan, Cambodia, Thailand, Burma, and Japan. He also made special visits to countries responsible for Laos, such as Britain, France, the United States, and Canada, to further strengthen Laos' relations with these countries. However, while he was resting abroad, the Laotian government had allowed South Vietnam and the Chiang Kai-shek gang to establish diplomatic agencies in Laos, thus changing Laos' foreign policy.

Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, September 8th: According to a broadcast by the Lao Fighting Forces Radio today, the movement of officers and soldiers of the Royal Lao Army against the Phoumi Nosavan clique is growing.

In the Bolikhan area of Vientiane Province, 187 Royal Lao Army personnel have left their units and returned to their hometowns since the end of August. In the Kangke area of Khammouane Province, around 200 Royal Lao Army personnel have returned to their hometowns.

The broadcast said that the majority of officers and soldiers temporarily controlled by the Phoumi Nosavan clique also support the coup committee. They do not want to see the spectacle of fratricide. Some units have already risen up against the Phoumi Nosavan clique and killed their reactionary commanders.

Many of the troops sent to suppress the people are unwilling to carry out the orders of the Phoumi Nosavan clique and have defected to the people.

Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, September 7th: Vientiane News: Phoumi Nosavan has decided to restore the "Anti-Coup Committee" and plot to "continue fighting Kong Le." After being appointed as Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of the Interior of the Laotian government, he did not go to Vientiane to be sworn in but went to Savannakhet.

According to a broadcast by Savannakhet Radio, controlled by Phoumi Nosavan, Phoumi Nosavan convened a meeting of some of his officers in Savannakhet on September 7th and decided to re-establish the "Anti-Coup Committee." It was previously reported that Phoumi Nosavan had announced the dissolution of the "Anti-Coup Committee" on August 30th.

According to the broadcast, the meeting also decided that "the command headquarters of each military region must control all areas." The broadcast said, "The National Army Command Headquarters stationed in Savannakhet instructed the Second, Third, and Fourth Military Regions to inspect aircraft at airports throughout the country."

According to a statement by this "Anti-Coup Committee" broadcast by Savannakhet Radio on September 5th, Phoumi Nosavan has moved to Savannakhet in order to continue fighting Kong Le. The statement also clamored that "the amnesty for Kong Le should be revoked."

    富马在万象公务人员和官兵集会上讲话
    重申老挝要执行和平中立政策
    王国军队广大官兵反对骨肉相残
    新华社河内8日电　万象电台今天广播：老挝首相富马亲王9月6日在万象市一万多公务人员和军官的集会上发表讲话说和平中立政策是他和老挝人民所希望的政策。老挝人民因为希望获得安宁和实现真正的和平中立，最近已经起来举行政变。他说，这个政策在四年以前曾经开始实现，并一直执行到1957年底。在前寮国战斗部队参加到国家的共同生活之后他才到外国去休息。
    富马接着说，他在出国前曾经要求老挝人联合党中的朋友们根据他的政策来治理国家。但是情况的发展不很如意，后来的政府改变了他的政策中的许多要点。
    富马说，老挝是一个小国，必须真正地中立。在他当首相的时候，他访问过越南民主共和国、中华人民共和国、南越、台湾、柬埔寨、泰国、缅甸、日本。他还特别访问了对老挝负有责任的英、法、美、加拿大等国，使老挝同这些国家的关系更加密切。不过，当他在外国休息的时候，老挝政府已允许南越和蒋帮在老挝设立外交机关，因此，老挝的对外政策有了改变。
    新华社河内8日电　据寮国战斗部队电台今天广播，老挝王国军队官兵反对富米·诺萨万集团的运动正日益高涨。
    在万象省的波里坎地区，从8月底到现在，已有一百八十七名王国军队人员离开部队返回自己的家乡。在甘蒙省的坎格地区，有二百名左右王国军队人员返回了自己的家乡。
    广播说，暂时被富米·诺萨万集团控制的大多数官兵也都支持政变委员会。他们不愿见到骨肉相残的景象。其中有的单位已经起来反对富米·诺萨万集团，并打死了他们的反动指挥官。
    被派去镇压人民的部队中，许多人不愿执行富米·诺萨万集团的命令，并已投到人民的怀抱里。
    新华社河内7日电　万象消息：富米·诺萨万已决定恢复“反政变委员会”，策划“同贡勒继续战斗”。他在被任命为老挝政府的副首相兼内政大臣以后，并没有到万象宣誓就职，却到了沙湾拿吉。
    据受富米·诺萨万控制的沙湾拿吉电台广播，富米·诺萨万7日纠合了一些他手下的军官在沙湾拿吉开会，决定重新恢复“反政变委员会”。前已报道，富米·诺萨万在8月30日曾宣布解散“反政变委员会”。
    据广播，这次会议还决定“各军区指挥部必须控制各地”。广播说，“驻沙湾拿吉的国家军队指挥部指示第二、三、四军区检查全国各机场的飞机”。
    据沙湾拿吉电台5日广播的这个“反政变委员会”的一项声明说，富米·诺萨万已迁往沙湾拿吉，以便同贡勒继续战斗。这项声明还叫嚣，“应当取消对贡勒的赦免”。
