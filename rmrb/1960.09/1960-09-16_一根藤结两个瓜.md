    Two Melons on One Vine	Huang Fasen

    Factory Director Zhang of the Tiemu Farm Implement Factory and two workers, braving the heat, carried their tools to the Xinsheng Production Team, which had been linked with them for over a year, to repair farm implements. As soon as they stepped onto the team's land, they were greeted by an enticing scene. The commune members were busy watering and fertilizing the newly planted vegetables; rows of blue and white eggplants shone brightly in the sun. Round or plump, watermelons, cantaloupes, and pumpkins lay among the green leaves, and the red, heavy tomatoes bent the branches. As he walked, Factory Director Zhang looked around, and the commune members laughed and sang, working harder and happier.

    Factory Director Zhang was a young man of about twenty-five or six, with a sturdy and capable build. Two years ago, he was just an ordinary worker, but later became the factory director. Last year, hearing the Party's call to support agriculture and link up with agricultural communes and teams, the Party branch assigned him to lead a team to the countryside. Thus, he led workers to visit rural areas, delivering machines and repairing farm implements, traveling to many communes and production teams in several counties.

    This April, Factory Director Zhang delivered machines to a linked commune—the Tuanlin Commune. There, they were conducting a major inspection of improved tools. Factory Director Zhang looked here, looked there, asked this, asked that, showing interest in everything, as if he was going back to produce them. This year, various new tools had appeared in the Jianghan Plain for processing summer grain, and there were many types here, such as a one-ox, two-stone mill, a one-ox, four-stone mill, and a small steel mill… This small steel mill could grind at least several hundred catties of flour a day, and sometimes up to a thousand catties. Factory Director Zhang moved them around, repeatedly praising: "Good mill! Good mill!" Finally, he thought to himself: "The summer grain harvest this year is not bad, maybe other places will also need this kind of good mill to grind flour."

    It was the busy season of "Double Rush" (harvesting and planting) in the countryside. Factory Director Zhang went to the Xinsheng Team again to help repair farm implements. On the way, he met Team Leader Liu of this team, who was leading a group of people to transport wheat to the city to be processed into flour. Factory Director Zhang was surprised and said: "Oh dear! You are so busy with farming, and you still use so many people to process flour?" "We eat a lot, and the oxen pull the mill so slowly, what can we do!" Team Leader Liu looked troubled, fanning himself with his hat, and added: "The labor is very intense, and we still have to use dozens of laborers a month for this. If it rains, it's even harder to transport it." Factory Director Zhang was taken aback, and immediately smiled: "I have a good idea! I have a good idea!" He asked Team Leader Liu to turn back to the team to discuss it in detail.

    Under the lamplight, Factory Director Zhang told Team Leader Liu and everyone about the small steel mill he had learned about. Finally, he said with relish: "I even ate white steamed buns and twisted rolls there! The flour is very fine." This made the commune members very happy. They said, "That's great! You are like a flying courier and a sensitive ear, always finding good things for us." Team Leader Liu said: "Our whole team has more than four hundred people, and with one of these small steel mills, we will not only have enough to eat but also have some to spare!" Before leaving, Factory Director Zhang inspected the kitchen, looking at the pots, stoves, and cutting knives, putting everything in his heart, and the commune members wondered why.

    A week later, the small steel mill started working, and at the same time, a steam stove and a vegetable cutting machine were installed in the kitchen... This saved a batch of labor for the team and put it on the front line of production. This kind of steam stove saves both manpower and fuel, and can both cook and disinfect bowls and chopsticks, providing hot water to drink and wash with all day long. Everyone calls it the "omnipotent stove."

    When they saw Factory Director Zhang coming again today, how could the commune members not welcome him like welcoming relatives! Cook Aunt Li invited him to drink noodle soup and eat steamed buns, saying as she handed them over: "Factory Director Zhang, you have contributed to this!" "Not at all, this is the Party's call and the workers' efforts." Team Leader Liu told him that thanks to the support of their factory, the labor force in the "logistics department" had been reduced, the labor force in the fields had been increased, and the vegetables had been managed more carefully, and this season's vegetables had increased by at least twenty or thirty percent.

    From then on, new farm implements from the farm implement factory were tested in the team, and after listening to the opinions, they continued to improve them. Later, everyone came up with a poem to praise this friendship:

    Two melons on one vine,
    Workers and peasants are one family,
    Brothers and sisters hold hands,
    Urban and rural areas bloom together in a great leap forward.

    一根藤结两个瓜	黄发森
    铁木农具厂的张厂长和两个工人，冒着炎热，背着工具，到挂钩一年多的新生生产队修理农具。一踏进队的土地，到处是诱人的景象，社员们正忙着为刚种下的蔬菜浇水、施肥；一排排蓝色的、白色的茄子，迎着太阳发出耀眼的反光。圆的圆、胖的胖，西瓜、香瓜、南瓜，躺在绿叶丛中，红冬冬的西红柿，把枝杈都压弯了。张厂长边走边看，只见社员们一阵笑、一阵歌，越干越高兴。
    张厂长是个二十五、六岁的年轻人，长得精悍、结实。两年前他还是一个普通工人，后来当了厂长。去年，听到党号召：要支援农业，要和农业社、队挂钩，于是，党支部指定他带队下乡。这样，他带领工人下乡访问，送机器，修理农具，先后走了几个县的许多公社和生产队。
    今年4月，张厂长送机器来到了一个挂钩公社——团林公社，这里正搞改良工具大检查，张厂长这也看，那也看，这也问，那也问，样样他都有兴趣，好像回去要生产似的。今年江汉平原加工夏粮出现了各种新工具，这里就有许多种，什么一牛两磨、一牛四磨，还有什么小钢磨……，这种小钢磨，一天起码磨几百斤面粉，多时达到千斤。张厂长搬搬弄弄，连声称赞：好磨！好磨！末了，他心想：今年夏粮收成还不错，说不定别处也要这种好磨磨面粉呢。
    正是农村双抢大农忙的日子，张厂长又到新生队去帮助修理农具。路上，遇到这个队的刘队长正带领一伙人把麦子运到城里来加工成面粉，张厂长惊讶地说：“哎呀！你们大农忙，还用这多人来搞面粉吗？”“吃得多，牛拉磨又慢吞吞地，有什么办法！”刘队长显出为难的神情，一边用帽搧风，一边补充道：“劳动挺紧张，一月还得用几十个劳力干这，如果遇到下雨，还不好走呢。”张厂长心里一怔，马上笑起来：“我有个好办法！我有个好办法！” 就约刘队长转回队里再细谈。
    灯光下，张厂长把了解到的小钢磨的事，一五一十告诉了刘队长和大家。最后津津有味地说：“我还吃到了那里的白馒头、花卷呐！面粉细细的。”这一说，可把社员们乐坏了。连说，“这好！这好！你这飞毛腿、顺风耳，到处为我们打听好事。”刘队长说：“我们全队四百多人，有一部这种小钢磨，不仅够吃还会有余了！”临走，张厂长到厨房里巡视了一遍，锅呀，灶呀，切菜刀呀，样样看到心里，社员们不知他为了什么。
    一个星期以后，小钢磨就开动了，同时，厨房里安上了蒸汽灶、切菜机……，这样，为这个队节约了一批劳动力，用到了生产第一线。这种蒸汽灶，又省人力、又省燃料，既作了饭，又能作碗筷消毒，一天到晚有开水喝，热水洗，大家叫它“万能灶”。
    当今天看到张厂长又来到的时候，社员怎不该像迎亲戚似地欢迎他呢！炊事员李姨妈请他喝面汤、吃馒头，边拿边说：“张厂长，这里面有你的功劳呀！”“哪里哪里，这是党的号召，工人们的努力。”刘队长告诉他，由于他们厂的支援，“后勤部”的劳力减少了，田间劳力加多了，蔬菜管得细了，这一季菜至少增产两、三成。
          ×××
    从此，农具厂新农具都来队里试验，听取了意见，再继续改进。后来，大家想出了一首诗来歌颂这种友谊：
    一根藤结两个瓜，
    工农兄弟是一家，
    兄弟双双手拉手，
    城乡齐开跃进花。
