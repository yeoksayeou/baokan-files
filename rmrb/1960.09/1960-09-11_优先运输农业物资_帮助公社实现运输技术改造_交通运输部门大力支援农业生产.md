    Prioritize the Transportation of Agricultural Materials and Help Communes Achieve Transportation Technology Transformation
    Transportation Departments Vigorously Support Agricultural Production

    (Our report) On the national transportation front, a mass movement to support agriculture is developing vigorously. Transportation workers in Sichuan, Fujian, Hubei, Shanxi, Guangdong and other provinces are vigorously supporting agricultural production by prioritizing the transportation of agricultural materials, helping communes achieve transportation technology transformation, improving transportation planning, improving transportation conditions, and saving on the use of cultivated land.

    Transportation departments at all levels in Sichuan Province place the transportation of agricultural materials in a primary position, arranging it with priority and transporting it in advance. For agricultural production materials that are urgently needed, they transport as much as they have, and transport whenever needed. To support the rush planting work in the Ya'an Special District, they organized more than 100 vehicles to work through the night, transporting more than 5,000 people in time to strengthen the front line of agricultural production. The Iron and Steel Transportation Company sent its best model worker groups to the Chengdu Pesticide Factory and Fertilizer Factory to support the transportation of raw materials for the two factories, and contracted to transport pesticides and fertilizers to Huayang, Jintang and other counties.

    Transportation departments in various places regard supporting agricultural technology transformation as an important task of their own. First of all, they actively help people's communes reform transportation tools and achieve transportation technology transformation. According to the characteristics of mountainous areas and the needs of agricultural production, Fujian Province has carried out transportation construction centered on rail transport, vehicles, shipping, chutes and cableways. In the first half of this year, it built more than 2,300 kilometers of simple roads, more than 37,000 kilometers of cart tracks, and more than 2,000 kilometers of bamboo and wood rails, cableways, and chutes in rural and mountainous areas, greatly improving the rural transportation landscape and saving a lot of labor. After Qingning County’s Zhiping Commune vigorously promoted "one network and five modernizations," it saved one million workdays a year, turning the labor force from insufficient to surplus. Vehicle and ship repair factories and parts factories in Fujian Province and the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region are generally linked to communes, dispatching outstanding technicians and cadres to organize technical service teams or technical mobile teams, establishing a fixed and mobile repair and distribution network, helping communes reform transportation tools, repair farm implements, impart technology and train technicians. Fujian Mawei Shipyard has cultivated 390 mechanical workers for 24 counties by combining long-term training with short-term training, and combining professional technology with versatility. The Guangdong Provincial Department of Shipping has also trial-produced manual chain bucket fertilizer turning boats for agricultural production, and trial-produced motorized bamboo-reinforced concrete boats, straw-reinforced concrete boats, etc. with substitute materials to meet the needs of agricultural production.

    Hubei Province and Shanxi Province have made remarkable achievements and gained good experience in making transportation plans, improving transportation conditions, and saving the use of cultivated land in transportation construction. In conjunction with agricultural production, Zhaoyang County, Hubei Province, comprehensively planned transportation construction, realizing that every team has access to automobiles, every village has access to horse-drawn carts, and every field has access to flatbed carts, forming a criss-crossing transportation network. Zhaoyang's experience is being promoted in various places. For example, Jin Dian Commune in Yunmeng County promoted Zhaoyang’s experience, closely combining transportation construction with garden-style, mechanized new rural construction, forming four intersecting lines, contiguous fields, and zoned operations. The Shanxi Provincial Department of Transportation has taken eight measures to save the use of cultivated land in road construction. Their measures mainly include: according to the needs of urgency and agricultural and industrial development, compressing or postponing some highway construction projects to reduce land use, and transferring the labor force saved to the front line of agricultural production; in highway route selection and measurement, try to occupy as little or no cultivated land as possible; they also adopted measures such as strictly controlling the land area for highway greening to save the use of cultivated land in many ways.

    The characteristics of the vigorous support of agriculture by transportation departments in various places are that they are planned, arranged, regularized, and institutionalized; at the same time, they are closely combined with transportation tasks, strengthening county and commune transportation work, and carrying out county and commune transportation businesses. In the movement, many units not only powerfully supported agricultural production, but also improved their own work. For example, transportation departments in various places in Fujian Province sent business personnel to conduct in-depth investigations in rural areas, understand agricultural transportation requirements, and widely establish freight source communication networks in people's communes. Zhangzhou Railway Station in this province has launched a purchasing and sales agency business to serve agriculture. In the first half of the year, it purchased more than 750 tons of seeds and fish fry for communes, and sold vegetable seedlings on their behalf, which was warmly welcomed by the rural masses.

    优先运输农业物资　帮助公社实现运输技术改造
    交通运输部门大力支援农业生产
    本报讯　在全国交通运输战线上，一个支援农业的群众运动，正在轰轰烈烈地开展着。四川、福建、湖北、山西、广东等地交通运输职工，在优先运输农业物资，帮助公社实现运输技术改造，做好交通规划、改善运输条件、节约使用耕地等方面，大力支援农业生产。
    四川省各级交通部门都把运输农业物资放在首要地位，优先安排，提前运输。对于农业生产急需的物资，做到有多少，就运多少，什么时候要，就什么时候运。他们为了支援雅安专区的抢栽抢种工作，组织了一百多辆汽车连夜突击，及时运送五千多人加强了农业生产第一线。钢铁运输公司派了最优秀的标兵小组到成都农药厂、肥料厂，支援两厂的原料、材料运输，并且包干往华阳、金堂等县运送农药和肥料。
    各地交通部门都把支援农业的技术改造，作为自己的一项重要任务。首先积极帮助人民公社改革运输工具，实现运输的技术改造。福建省各地根据山区的特点和农业生产的需要，开展以轨道化、车子化、船运化、溜槽化和索道化为中心的交通建设，今年上半年在农村、山区修建了简易公路两千三百多公里，大车道三万七千多公里，竹木轨道、索道、溜槽等两千多公里，大大改善了农村交通面貌，节约了大量劳动力。清宁县治平公社大搞“一网五化”以后，一年可节约一百万个劳动工日，使劳力由不足到有余。福建省和广西僮族自治区的车船修造厂、配件厂，普遍与公社挂钩，派出优秀的技术工人和干部组织技术服务队或技术巡回队，建立固定和流动相结合的修配网，帮助公社改革运输工具，修理农具，传授技术和培训技术工人。福建马尾船厂，采取长期培养与短期训练相结合、专业技术和多面手相结合等办法，为二十四个县培养了三百九十名机械工人。广东省航运厅还为农业生产试制了人力链斗式捻肥船，用代用材料试制了机动竹筋水泥小艇、稻草水泥小艇等，以适应农业生产的需要。
    湖北省和山西省，在做好交通运输规划、改善交通条件以及在交通建设中节约使用耕地等方面，已经做出了显著成绩，并且取得了很好的经验。湖北省枣阳县结合农业生产，全面规划交通建设，实现了队队通汽车，庄庄通马车，田间通板车，构成了纵横贯通的运输网。枣阳的经验，正在各地推广。如云梦县金店公社推广了枣阳的经验，将交通建设和园田化、机耕化新农村建设紧密结合起来，形成了四线交叉，田园连片，作业分区。山西省交通厅采取了八项措施，在道路建设中节约使用耕地。他们的措施主要是：根据轻重缓急和农业、工业发展的需要，压缩或推迟一部分公路建设项目，以减少用地，并将节省下来的劳动力，调到农业生产第一线去；在公路选线测量中，尽量少占或不占耕地；他们还采取严格控制公路绿化的占地面积等办法，从多方面节约使用耕地。
    各地交通部门大力支援农业的特点，是有规划、有安排，经常化、制度化；同时，紧紧结合运输任务，加强县、社交通工作，开展县、社运输业务。在运动中，很多单位不但有力地支援了农业生产，还改进了自己的工作。例如，福建省各地交通部门派出业务人员，深入农村调查，了解农业运输要求，广泛在人民公社建立货源通讯网。这个省的漳州汽车站开展了为农业服务的代购代销业务，上半年为公社代购种子、鱼苗，代销菜苗等七百五十多吨，受到了农村群众的热烈欢迎。（附图片）
