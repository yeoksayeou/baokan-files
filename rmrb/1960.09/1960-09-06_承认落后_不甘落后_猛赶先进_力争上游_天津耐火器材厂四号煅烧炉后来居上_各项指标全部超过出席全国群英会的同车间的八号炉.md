    Acknowledge Backwardness, Unwilling to Lag Behind; Vigorously Catch Up with the Advanced, Strive for the Top
    The No. 4 Calcining Furnace of Tianjin Refractory Material Factory Surpasses
    the No. 8 Furnace of the Same Workshop, Which Attended the National Congress of Heroes.
    This newspaper reports: The workers of the No. 4 calcining furnace in the oil brick workshop of Tianjin Refractory Material Factory, dared to admit backwardness, but were unwilling to lag behind. They worked hard and strived for the top, catching up with the advanced collective, the No. 8 furnace of the same workshop, which attended the National Congress of Heroes, at high speed. They have become a red banner in the refractory material production aspect of the city's steel front.
    No. 4 furnace and No. 8 furnace are two calcining furnaces with the same conditions and adjacent to each other, specializing in sintering dolomite to make oil bricks to supply various steel factories. No. 8 furnace attended the National Congress of Heroes of the industrial, transportation, capital construction, and finance and trade fronts in 1959. At the meeting, after evaluation by the same industry, the indicators of output, quality, utilization coefficient, and consumption were all among the best in the country. No. 4 furnace had made contributions in supporting steel production and was named "Youth Furnace" by the factory. No. 8 furnace was superior to No. 4 furnace in many aspects.
    In the past, some cadres of No. 4 furnace always felt that No. 8 furnace and No. 4 furnace were originally the same, and were not much better in comparison, so they were unwilling to humbly learn from No. 8 furnace. In March of this year, after studying Chairman Mao's "On Contradiction", they realized that in the past they could not see the progress of No. 8 furnace in various aspects, and always held on to the old views, which was metaphysics at work. Then, they went to No. 8 furnace to "watch the battle." At that time, the workers of No. 8 furnace were adding materials to the furnace. Indeed, the materials were added evenly, and the coal was distributed evenly.... They realized that: in the past, they only saw the achievements under their own eyes, and could not see the progress of others, which had the danger of preventing all furnaces from catching up. Tian Jinhua, the leader of the No. 4 furnace and a member of the Communist Youth League, realized that he was indeed behind. He decided to hold a joint meeting of the three shifts on the same day. At the meeting, everyone spoke one after another, and everyone was determined to work hard, learn from No. 8 furnace with an open mind, and catch up with No. 8 furnace. They put forward the slogan "Learn from No. 8, catch up with No. 8, surpass No. 8, and make contributions to supporting the steel marshal," and set specific goals to catch up with and surpass No. 8 furnace.
    The revolutionary action of No. 4 furnace immediately received the support of the Party and Youth League organizations of the workshop, and the person in charge of the calcination section and the former leader of No. 8 furnace, Guo Yongliang, was sent to No. 4 furnace to introduce experience. The trade union and the Youth League branch also specially organized a technical performance competition in the work section for No. 4 furnace, focusing on introducing the operating experience of No. 8 furnace. The workers of No. 8 furnace also warmly expressed to the comrades of No. 4 furnace that they would help them selflessly. These greatly encouraged the enthusiasm of the workers of No. 4 furnace and enhanced their confidence. In order to learn seriously, they all formulated learning plans and went to No. 8 furnace to "squat down," and worshiped the workers of No. 8 furnace as their teachers. In order to learn the experience of uniform material addition, Tian Jinhua went to No. 8 furnace every day to observe the workers' operations for several days in a row. This day, he ran to No. 8 furnace to "watch the battle" again, and happened to meet Wang Chunting, the deputy leader of No. 8 furnace, on duty. He asked Wang Chunting many technical questions; asking was not enough, he also requested on-the-spot experiments; one furnace of experiments was not enough, he also invited Wang Chunting to his own furnace to give guidance, and continued to experiment until he learned it himself. After mastering the technique of material addition, he immediately convened a joint meeting of the three shifts the next morning to introduce this advanced experience and practice the operation in turns on the spot. Finally, everyone sat down together to discuss and summarize the advantages and disadvantages, and incorporated this operation into the operating procedures. In this way, they watched one, learned one; learned one, used one; and consolidated one when they used one. The learning progressed quickly.
    Diligently watching, listening, asking, practicing, and summarizing, the workers of No. 4 furnace were fascinated by learning advanced experience. Whether in the dormitory, the dining hall, or on the way home, as long as they met the workers of No. 8 furnace, they would not let go of the opportunity to learn. Every day when they went to and from work, they also detoured to No. 8 furnace to take a look and learn for a while. Big experiences had to be learned, and small experiences were never let go.
    After two months of hard work, at the end of May, No. 4 furnace caught up with No. 8 furnace according to the original plan, and the daily output increased by about 25%.
    The Party organization of the workshop closely cared about the progress of No. 4 furnace. Just when they caught up with No. 8 furnace and everyone was in high spirits, the secretary of the Party branch of the workshop came to this group and participated in their joint meeting of the three shifts. On the one hand, he congratulated them, and on the other hand, he put forward new requirements to them. "It's very good to humbly learn from the experience of No. 8 furnace and catch up with them, but it's not enough. Can you develop and create new experiences continuously on the basis of learning, and surpass them?" After hearing the secretary's words, everyone used their brains and came up with ideas, and soon a "create new records, create new experiences" upsurge was set off in the group.
    After five months of hard work, the mental outlook and production outlook of the workers of No. 4 furnace have undergone great changes. Under the leadership of the Party, all thirty-six people in the group cooperated with each other, creating good conditions for the next shift, "go up when encountering difficulties, give way when encountering honors, learn when encountering advanced, and help when encountering backward," with one effort and one goal, rushing to produce refractory materials for the steel factory day and night. In August, the average daily output level of dolomite reached 19.1 tons, the utilization coefficient reached 2.16, the pass rate reached more than 95%, and the consumption was also significantly reduced. All indicators have exceeded those of No. 8 furnace.
    Recently, the staff of No. 8 furnace has submitted a new war report, expressing that they will learn from each other and improve together with No. 4 furnace in the new battle, and work together to supply more "grain and grass" for the steel factory.

    承认落后　不甘落后  猛赶先进　力争上游
    天津耐火器材厂四号煅烧炉后来居上
    各项指标全部超过出席全国群英会的同车间的八号炉
    本报讯　天津市耐火器材厂油砖车间四号煅烧炉的工人们，敢于承认落后，又不甘于落后，埋头苦干，力争上游，以高速度赶过本车间出席全国群英会的先进集体八号炉，成为全市钢铁战线耐火材料生产方面的一面红旗。
    四号炉和八号炉是两座条件相同而又相邻的煅烧炉，专门烧结白云石，做油砖供应各钢厂。八号炉在1959年出席过全国工业、交通运输、基本建设、财贸战线的群英会；会上，经过同行业评定，产量、质量、利用系数、消耗等指标都在全国名列前茅。四号炉在支援钢铁生产中立过功劳，曾被厂里命名为“青年炉”。八号炉在许多方面都高于四号炉。
    四号炉的部分干部过去总是觉得八号炉和四号炉原来都是一样的，比较起来也不高明多少，因而不肯虚心向八号炉学习。今年3月间，他们经过学习毛主席的著作《矛盾论》，认识到过去看不见八号炉在各方面的进步，老是抱着以前的老看法不放，是形而上学的观点在作怪。接着，他们到八号炉去“观战”。当时，八号炉的工人正在向炉内加料。确实料加得平，炭给得也匀……。他们认识到：过去光看见自己眼睛底下的那点成绩，看不见别人的进步，有让各个炉都赶上去的危险。共青团员、四号炉炉长田金华意识到自己确实落后了。他决定当天就开个三班联席会。会上，你一言我一语，大家决心埋头苦干一番，虚心学习八号炉，并要赶过八号炉。他们提出了“学八号，赶八号，超八号，支援钢帅立功劳”的口号，订出了赶上和超过八号炉的具体目标。
    四号炉的革命行动马上得到了车间党、团组织的支持，并且派煅烧工段负责人、原八号炉炉长郭永良到四号炉介绍经验。工会和团支部还特意为四号炉在工段里组织了一次技术表演赛，集中地介绍了八号炉的操作经验。八号炉的工人也热情地向四号炉战友表示，要无私地帮助他们。这些都大大地鼓舞了四号炉工人的干劲，增强了信心。为了认真学习，他们都制订了学习规划，分头到八号炉“蹲点”，拜八号炉工人为师。为了学习加料均匀的经验，田金华一连好几天，天天都到八号炉观察工人们的操作。这天，他又跑到八号炉来“观战”，正赶上八号炉副炉长王春庭在班。他就向王春庭提出了许多技术上的问题；问了还不算，他还要求当场试验；试验完了一炉还不算，他又把王春庭请到自己的炉上做指导，继续试验，直到自己学会了为止。加料的技术掌握了，第二天上午，他就马上召开三班联席会，介绍这项先进经验，当场轮流练习操作。最后，大家又一起座谈，总结优缺点，并且把这项操作纳入了操作规程。他们就这样，看一个，学一个；学一个，用一个；用一个，就巩固一个，学习进展很快。
    勤看、勤听、勤问、勤练、勤总结，四号炉工人学习先进经验着了迷。不管是在宿舍、饭厅，还是在回家的路上，只要碰上八号炉的工人，他们就不放过学习的机会。每天上下班，他们也要绕道到八号炉来看一看，学一会。大经验要学，小经验也从不放过。
    经过两个月的努力，5月底，四号炉按原订计划赶上了八号炉，日产量上升了25％左右。
    车间党组织密切关心着四号炉的进步，就在他们赶上八号炉、人人心情振奋的时刻，车间党支部书记来到了这个小组，参加了他们的三班联席会，一方面向他们祝贺，一方面向他们提出了新的要求。“虚心学习八号炉的经验，赶上了他们，这很好，但是这还不够。你们能不能在学习的基础上，发扬独创精神，不断发展和创造新的经验，超过他们？”听了书记这席话，大伙人人动脑筋，出点子，很快在小组里掀起了一个“创造新纪录、创造新经验”的热潮。
    埋头苦干了五个月，四号炉工人们的精神面貌和生产面貌都发生了很大变化。全组三十六个人在党的领导下，互相协作，互相为下班创造良好条件，“见困难就上，见荣誉就让，见先进就学，见后进就帮”，一股劲，一个目标，日日夜夜为钢厂高产赶制耐火材料。8月份白云石料的平均日产水平达到十九点一吨，利用系数达到二点一六，正品率达到95％以上，消耗也显著降低。各项指标全部超过了八号炉。
    最近，八号炉的职工又递来了新的战表，表示要同四号炉在新的战斗中互教互学，共同提高，携手前进，为钢厂供应更多的“粮草”。
