Xinhua News Agency, 19th, Leopoldville News: Congolese Prime Minister Lumumba, on the 18th, at his residence, revealed to Reuters reporters via telephone the activities of the United States in manipulating the United Nations to oppose the legitimate Congolese government and interfere in Congolese internal affairs. Speaking of the chaotic situation in the Congo in recent days due to the intervention of the United Nations, he said that United Nations officials in the Congo had attempted to overthrow him.

He said, "I asked them (referring to United Nations officials) to maintain order, and they refused; therefore, I asked to have my 1,500 troops airlifted from Stanleyville to here, but they closed the (Congolese) airport." He also said that someone gave Mobutu (Army Chief of Staff) 5 million francs to overthrow the Congolese government.

Lumumba said that the closure of the Soviet and Czechoslovak embassies in the Congo by Mobutu was instigated behind the scenes by certain Western countries.

In the conversation, Lumumba accused United Nations officials of obstructing him from going to New York to attend the United Nations General Assembly.

Lumumba announced that he had not "lost his effectiveness." He said that the parliament is the supreme power organ in the Congo, and the parliament has voted to support him. He said that he had recently received telegrams of support from Kasai Province, Leopoldville Province, and Orientale Province.

At the same time, with the connivance of the "United Nations Forces," Mobutu continued to conduct rebel activities in the capital, Leopoldville. According to the Associated Press, on the morning of the 18th, Mobutu again directed his reactionary troops to surround the parliament building, preventing members from entering to attend the meeting. At the time, the "United Nations Forces" deployed around the parliament merely watched from the sidelines without intervening. According to United Press International, on the 18th, Mobutu, with the help of the "United Nations Forces," also arrested a Congolese military officer because this officer opposed his betrayal.

    卢蒙巴总理向记者发表谈话
    揭露美国操纵联合国干涉刚果内政
    蒙博托在“联合国军”纵容下继续进行叛乱活动
    新华社19日讯　利奥波德维尔消息：刚果总理卢蒙巴18日在他的官邸通过电话向路透社记者揭露美国操纵联合国反对刚果合法政府和干涉刚果内政的活动。他在谈到这几天由于联合国的干涉而在刚果出现的混乱局势时说，联合国在刚果的官员曾设法推翻他。
    他说，“我要求他们（指联合国官员）维持秩序，他们拒绝了；因而我要求把我的一千五百名军队从斯坦利维尔空运到这里来，而他们却封闭了（刚果）机场。”他又说，有人给蒙博托（陆军参谋长）五百万法郎要他推翻刚果政府。
    卢蒙巴说，蒙博托封闭苏联和捷克斯洛伐克在刚果的大使馆是某些西方国家在背后指使的。
    卢蒙巴在谈话中指责联合国官员阻挠他去纽约出席联合国大会。
    卢蒙巴宣布他并没有“失去作用”。他说，议会是刚果的最高权力机关，议会已投票支持他。他说，他最近接到来自开赛省、利奥波德维尔省和东方省表示支持他的电报。
    在这同时，在“联合国军”的纵容下，蒙博托继续在首都利奥波德维尔进行叛乱活动。据美联社报道，18日上午，蒙博托又指挥他的反动军队包围了议会大厦，阻止议员进去开会。当时，布置在议会周围的“联合国军”只是在一旁观看未加干涉。据合众国际社报道，18日，蒙博托还在“联合国军”的帮助下，逮捕了一名刚果军官，因为这位军官反对他的背叛行为。
