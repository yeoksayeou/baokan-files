A Good Cadre of the People

Wang Guiji, the First Secretary of the Tang County Party Committee in Hebei Province, is praised by the masses as a "Good Cadre of the People." Over the past few years, Wang Guiji has consistently worked on the front lines of production, eating, living, and laboring alongside the masses. He consults with them on all matters and promptly discusses solutions to problems with them. Upholding collective leadership and leveraging collective wisdom has become an unwavering principle in his leadership. In the event of significant issues, he always relies on the collective leadership of the County Party Committee to study and decide, after which everyone goes their separate ways to execute. The "Ten Field Management Directives" created by this county is a summary of collective leadership wisdom; and this experience has been extended to leading local industry, implementing "Ten Directives to the Workshop" leadership method. When promoting the "Two-Five System" leadership experience, they also proposed launching a movement to make friends with the masses, as well as "Three Combinations" and other working methods.

Wang Guiji and other leading comrades of the County Party Committee, in their practical work, have especially conscientiously implemented the Party's policies and guidelines, and outstandingly implemented the Party's mass line, mobilizing the enthusiasm of the vast number of cadres and the masses, enabling this county's various construction undertakings to achieve extremely rapid development.

Now, Wang Guiji is working hard with the masses to continue to fight hard, focus on field management, and strive for a bountiful autumn harvest. (Attached pictures)

    王桂冀和县委的其他领导同志，在实践工作中特别认真地贯彻执行党的方针政策，出色地贯彻执行党的群众路线，调动起广大干部和群众的积极性，使这个县的各项建设事业获得了极其迅速的发展。
