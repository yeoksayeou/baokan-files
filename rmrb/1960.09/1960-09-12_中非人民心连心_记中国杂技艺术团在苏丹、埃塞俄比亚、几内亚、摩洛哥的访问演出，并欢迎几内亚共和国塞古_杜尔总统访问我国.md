The Hearts of the Chinese and African People are Linked Together
--On the Visit and Performance of the China Acrobatic Troupe in Sudan, Ethiopia, Guinea, and Morocco, and Welcoming the Visit of President Sékou Touré of the Republic of Guinea to Our Country
Qu Wu, Vice President of the Chinese-African People's Friendship Association and Head of the China Acrobatic Troupe

Just as the worldwide tide of opposition to imperialism and colonialism is surging, and the struggles of African people to win and safeguard national independence are rising vigorously, we accepted the entrustment of the people of our motherland and formed an acrobatic troupe composed of outstanding acrobats from various fields to go to Africa for a friendly visit and performance.

The China Acrobatic Troupe left the country on January 8th of this year. In more than seven months, it visited Sudan, Ethiopia, Guinea, and Morocco respectively, going to 27 cities and performing 98 shows, with approximately 160,000 viewers, averaging over 1,500 people per show. Although we only visited these four countries, those who watched the performances of the China Acrobatic Troupe and came into contact with us were not limited to these four countries. At the premiere performance of the acrobatic troupe in Guinea, representatives from over 70 Asian and African countries attending the Second Asian-African People's Solidarity Conference were present. Wherever the China Acrobatic Troupe went, we expressed the Chinese people's admiration and support for the African national independence movement, the Chinese people's cordial greetings to the African people, and also brought back the deep friendship of the African people towards our people. Now, the China Acrobatic Troupe has successfully completed its mission and returned to the capital of our great motherland; however, the profound impressions we gained during our visits to the four African countries, especially the strong will of the African people to oppose imperialism and colonialism and the strong desire for friendly solidarity with the Chinese people, will linger in the memory of each of us for a long time.

				“Six Hundred and Fifty Million”

The African people are very warm and hospitable, especially towards guests from China. During the China Acrobatic Troupe's visit and performance in the four African countries, it received grand courtesy from the governments of the host countries and a warm welcome from people of all strata everywhere. The heads of state of Sudan, Ethiopia, Guinea, and Morocco all watched our performances. President Abboud of Sudan, who never goes to the theater, made an exception to watch the performance of the China Acrobatic Troupe and presented gifts. At the final farewell performance we held on the eve of our departure from Sudan, the ministers of the Sudanese government stopped their meeting midway to come and watch. Emperor Selassie I of Ethiopia and the Empress watched the entire performance. Selassie I applauded frequently for each program, received all the members of the troupe during the intermission, and gave everyone commemorative gold coins; he also ordered the relevant departments three times within half a day to take good care of the China Acrobatic Troupe.

In Guinea, President Sékou Touré and his wife, along with the ministers of various departments, personally attended our opening ceremony. After the performance, President Touré and his wife went on stage to shake hands with all the actors one by one, congratulating them on the success of the performance; the next morning, they sent flowers to express their regards, giving us great encouragement. King Mohammed V of Morocco enjoyed the performance of the acrobatic troupe in the courtyard of the Abatte Palace and hosted a luncheon for the entire troupe.

The central governments and local authorities of these countries also gave friendly assistance and support to the acrobatic troupe's performances. Emperor Selassie I of Ethiopia designated the Assistant Minister of Education and the Director of the Intelligence Department Office to be specifically responsible for receiving the acrobatic troupe. The military commander of the Obeid area of Sudan organized a city-wide reception committee to welcome us. The Governor of Beni Mellal Province in Morocco volunteered to post the acrobatic troupe's posters as far as 50 kilometers outside the city. The warm reception of many local authorities in Guinea moved us deeply. During the performance in Kankan, the wife of the administrative district chief led more than a dozen women to prepare meals for us in shifts. To suit our tastes, in addition to the unique Guinean food, they also made rice and noodles. They said: "It is our honor to serve our Chinese friends; we will be happy as long as you are satisfied with the food." The administrative district chief of Kankan specially vacated part of his residence for us to stay in. The administrative district chief of Labe welcomed and saw us off as far as 40 kilometers away, and also organized a welcoming rally of nearly 10,000 people.

As for the great love of the broad masses of people for New China and the acrobatic troupe, it is naturally even more touching. Citizens of Khartoum, the capital of Sudan, applauded to express their welcome when we visited the Arab market. Many people ran up to shake hands with us; others stood on high ground and cheered enthusiastically, "Long live the People's Republic of China!" "Long live Mao Zedong!" During the performance in Abualoua, the audience waited at the door after the show to shake hands with us; some even secretly reached out from the tent seams in the backstage. In Dalaba, a scenic resort in Guinea, the secretary of the ruling Democratic Party's grassroots organization said enthusiastically: "Dear friends, you can tell from the smiling faces of everyone here how satisfied they are with your arrival." Indeed, we saw such friendly expressions everywhere in Guinea. An old musician with white hair in Labe played the "Balafon" for us -- a kind of crisp-sounding coconut wood zither; the women sang and danced to the rhythm of the music, and when they were most excited, they simply took off their headscarves and kicked off their slippers, stepping to the beat barefoot on the scorching sand, shouting "Long live the People's Republic of China!" In the village of Boye in Kankan, men and women, old and young, led by the village chief, lined up to welcome the acrobatic troupe, and also offered water, "Kola" (a fruit that can stimulate the nerves), and whole sheep to the acrobatic troupe according to the ancient customs of Guinea, which is the highest courtesy for treating distinguished guests.

Through more than half a year of direct contact, we deeply felt that the Chinese people and the African people, because they have the same experience of being invaded, ruled, and oppressed by imperialism and the same demands for opposing imperialism, understand each other as soon as they meet and have a brotherly affection. The reason why the people of African countries warmly welcome the acrobatic troupe is also because they regard New China as a reliable friend. The administrative district chief and Democratic Party secretary of Dalaba in Guinea emphasized: "The people of Guinea and China are comrades-in-arms on the front against imperialism." The Director of the Intelligence Department Office of Ethiopia repeatedly asked us about China's construction experience. African friends regard the acrobatic troupe's visit and performance as a support for them. The leader of the voluntary labor team of the Youth League in Labe, Guinea, said: "After Guinea's independence, no one from France, the United States, Britain, or Spain came, but you came to our young country from faraway China. We thank you for your friendship and support."

"The friendship and support of 650 million Chinese people" was the sentence that won the warmest applause and the strongest response throughout our visit and performance. Whenever we said, "650 million Chinese people will always stand on the side of the African brothers who are fighting for national liberation," the masses always responded with thunderous applause and heartfelt cheers. When the acrobatic troupe performed in Kankan, a major city in Guinea with a glorious tradition of opposing imperialism, a worker backstage heard our speech and could not restrain his inner excitement, repeatedly writing "650 million," "650 million" on the sand with his hand... The administrative district chief of Kankan said it well: "With the great 650 million Chinese people as our friends, what is imperialism!"

			“Not technique, but magic!”

With a long history and tradition, and vigorous development since liberation, Chinese acrobatics has won praise and acclaim from people of all walks of life in the four African countries; the attendance rate is higher than any foreign performing troupe, and the proportion of the audience in the local population is very large. There were more than 50,000 Guinean viewers, accounting for more than 30% of the total population of the nine cities visited by the acrobatic troupe. At a square performance in a small city in western Sudan, the audience was as large as 8,000 people. Many people braved the rain and walked dozens of kilometers specifically to enjoy Chinese acrobatics.

The Assistant Minister of Education and Theater Manager of Ethiopia said that the grand occasion of the China Acrobatic Troupe's performance can only be compared with the China Cultural and Art Troupe's visit to Ethiopia in 1956; the audience even broke down the theater's doors. In the Khouribga mining area of Morocco, which is rich in phosphate, the audience, most of whom were miners, expressed their love for Chinese art with unusually warm applause. After the show, people couldn't help but shout "Long live China!" outside the door. Many political figures showed great interest in our acrobatics. Farid, the Sudanese Minister of Information and Labor, watched it eleven times in a row, and also sent seventeen young soldiers to the acrobatic troupe to study. The Governor of Harar Province in Ethiopia twice brought his whole family to watch our performances from 30 kilometers away.

Chinese acrobatics became the center of discussion among the people of all cities for a while, and newspapers and magazines also published comments. The Guinean government's press release published a commentary titled "An Example of Friendship," calling on young people across the country to watch and learn from the acrobatic troupe's performances. Guinean public opinion generally praised our acrobatics as "concentratedly demonstrating the intelligence, wit, diligence, and bravery of the Chinese working people"; believing that "with rich imagination and highly precise acting skills, it seems not a technical performance, but magic!" A Moroccan newspaper said about the high spirits of the audience: "If there were a sound meter, it would definitely be shattered by the enthusiastic applause." The Moroccan "Echo" pointed out that "the amazing progress of Chinese acrobatics is due to the fact that the country's culture and art follow Chairman Mao Zedong's policy of 'letting a hundred flowers bloom and weeding through the old to bring forth the new'."

African audiences especially love our music, and one of the important reasons is that it has similarities and commonalities with African national music. The Deputy Commander-in-Chief of the Sudanese Army praised one of the characteristics of our performance is that the music is completely Oriental and very attractive. Several ministers of Sudan praised our music for being able to evoke an exchange of emotions between the two sides.

The African people are originally a nation that can sing and dance, with extraordinary artistic talents; during our visit and performance, we took advantage of every opportunity to learn. Whenever we played local national music, the stage and audience became one, and the whole audience was invigorated. Moroccan audiences often hummed quietly along with the Moroccan folk tunes played by Chinese instruments, and the Moroccan King was excited to tap his feet to the beat. The editor-in-chief of the Guinean government's press release commented on our performance of Guinean national music, saying: "Imperialists and colonialists have always despised Guinean music, but the Chinese people value and can appreciate our music so much, which is the pride of our nation."

				No one can isolate us

For a long time, Africa has been called the "Dark Continent" because of the colonialist's sinful rule; however, with the vigorous development of the African national liberation movement, the flags of independent countries are raised one after another, and colonialism is collapsing. It's just that they are not reconciled to their failure and are still carrying out various destructive activities, trying to re-establish the colonialist's "paradise" on the heads of the African people who have stood up.

Like Guinea, after gaining independence in October 1958, French imperialism, with the support of American imperialism, constantly tried to force Guinea to bow its head through economic blockade, withdrawal of technical personnel, destruction of materials and equipment, and closure of stores. In Kendia, we saw a hotel run by French colonialists, who even cut off the water pipes when they were expelled. However, the Guinean people did not waver in the slightest, and the Guinean government resolutely carried out a counter-blockade struggle to get rid of the economic control of French imperialism. The imperialists were infuriated and smuggled weapons into the country, plotting to armed subversion of the Guinean government and strangle the young republic. The Guinean government resolutely extinguished the armed rebellion, giving imperialism a heavy blow. At the "Exhibition of Physical Evidence of Armed Rebellion" held at the headquarters of the Guinea Democratic Party, rebel weapons seized from the border were displayed; American-made high explosives and grenades; West German-made pistols, rifles, and time bombs; French telecommunications equipment... Every weapon and document plotting subversion is an undeniable evidence of the imperialists' crime.

The African people cherish the independence of their motherland as they cherish their own eyes, and their soaring fighting spirit against imperialism is very inspiring. A district committee member of the Democratic Party in Farana, Guinea, said to us on stage at the end of a performance: "I swear to you that after hundreds of years of brutal rule by French colonialism, Guinea is economically backward, but the people of Guinea are politically and ideologically advanced. We are determined to carry the struggle against imperialism through to the end!"

The African people are proud to fight against imperialism because they can get the support of 650 million Chinese people. During our friendly visit, we often heard such words: "The Chinese people's anti-imperialist struggle and construction achievements give the African people great encouragement." We found that many people have read or are reading the works of Chairman Mao Zedong and Chairman Liu Shaoqi. People asked to introduce the experience of the Chinese revolution and construction; they are deeply interested in our country's major policies. The Secretary of the Democratic Party of Dalaba Administrative District in Guinea told us that reading Chairman Mao's literature on imperialism and all reactionaries being paper tigers greatly enhanced their courage and confidence in opposing imperialism. He said: "This document makes us understand that imperialism is not only something that should be opposed and can be opposed, but also something that can be overthrown." Sudanese students told us that Sudanese youth are all against the West and want to be friendly with China.

Of course, the imperialists hate the sentiment of the African people and the Chinese people sharing the same hatred; their method is to spread slanderous and distorted rumors about New China among the African people. But all their despicable tricks to isolate the friendship between the Chinese people and the African people are in vain. The friendship between the Chinese people and the African people is forged in the common struggle against imperialism. This combat friendship can never be destroyed by the imperialists' sabotage.

We have just returned from the African continent, which is boiling with the anti-imperialist struggle, and the vigorous spirit and sincere friendship of the African people still vividly linger in our minds; as Chinese guests who have been warmly entertained by President Sékou Touré, we are willing to wish President Touré and all the distinguished guests of the delegation good health and a happy spirit during their visit with all our enthusiasm!
Long live the friendship between the people of China and Guinea!
Long live the friendship between the Chinese and African people!

    中非人民心连心
    ——记中国杂技艺术团在苏丹、埃塞俄比亚、几内亚、摩洛哥的访问演出，并欢迎几内亚共和国塞古·杜尔总统访问我国
    中国非洲人民友好协会副会长中国杂技艺术团团长  屈武
    正当全世界反对帝国主义、殖民主义的怒潮汹涌澎湃，非洲人民争取和维护民族独立的斗争风起云涌的时候，我们接受祖国人民的委托，由各方面的优秀杂技演员组成了一个杂技艺术团，到非洲去进行友好访问演出。
    中国杂技艺术团从今年1月8日出国，在七个多月的时间里，分别访问了苏丹、埃塞俄比亚、几内亚和摩洛哥，先后到过二十七个城市，演出了九十八场，观众约十六万人次，平均每场在一千五百人以上。我们虽然只访问了这四个国家，但观看中国杂技艺术团演出和同我们接触的，不仅仅限于这四国。杂技团在几内亚的首场演出，就有参加第二届亚非人民团结大会的七十多个亚非国家的代表出席。随着中国杂技艺术团的足迹所至，我们表达了中国人民对非洲民族独立运动的钦佩和支持、中国人民对非洲人民的亲切问候，也带回了非洲人民对我国人民的深情厚谊。现在，中国杂技艺术团已经胜利地完成任务，回到我们伟大祖国的首都；但是，我们在访问非洲四国时得到的深刻印象，特别是非洲人民反对帝国主义和殖民主义的坚强意志、同中国人民友好团结的强烈愿望，却将长久地弥留在我们每个人的记忆之中。
                “六亿五千万”
    非洲人民是非常热情、好客的，对于来自中国的客人，更是如此。中国杂技艺术团在非洲四国访问演出的过程中，到处受到所在国政府的隆重礼遇和各阶层人民的热烈欢迎。苏丹、埃塞俄比亚、几内亚、摩洛哥四国的国家元首都观看了我们的演出。苏丹的阿布德主席从来不上剧场的，这次也破例前来观看中国杂技艺术团演出，并赠送礼物。我们在离开苏丹前夕举行的最后一场告别演出，苏丹政府的部长们中途停止了会议前来观看。埃塞俄比亚皇帝塞拉西一世和皇后观看了全部演出。塞拉西一世对每个节目都频频鼓掌，在中间休息的时候接见了全团人员，送给大家纪念金币；还在半天之内三次下令有关部门好好地接待中国杂技艺术团。
    在几内亚，塞古·杜尔总统夫妇和各部部长亲自参加了我们的开幕式。演出结束以后，杜尔总统和夫人上台和全体演员一一握手，祝贺演出的成功；第二天一清早又派人送来鲜花致意，给我们极大的鼓励。摩洛哥国王穆罕默德五世在阿巴特的王宫内院，欣赏了杂技团的演出，还宴请全团午餐。
    这些国家的中央政府和地方当局，也都给杂技团的演出以友好的协助和支持。埃塞俄比亚皇帝塞拉西一世指定教育部助理和情报部办公室主任，专门负责接待杂技团的工作。苏丹奥卑德地区的军事长官为了迎接我们，组织了全市接待委员会。摩洛哥的比尼梅勒省长自告奋勇地要把杂技团的海报一直贴到离城五十公里外的地方。几内亚许多地方当局的亲切接待，更使我们深受感动。在开西多哥演出期间，行政区长官的夫人带领十多位妇女，轮流为我们备餐。为了适合我们的口味，除了别具风味的几内亚食品外，还做了米饭和面条。她们说：“能为中国朋友们服务，是我们的光荣；只要你们吃得满意，我们就高兴了。”坎康行政区长官特地让出自己的一部分住宅，供给我们住宿。拉培行政区长官迎送我们远达四十公里，还组织了近万人的欢迎大会。
    至于广大人民对新中国和杂技团的热爱之情，自然更是特别感人。苏丹首都喀土穆的市民在我们参观阿拉伯市场时，纷纷鼓掌表示欢迎。许多人跑到我们跟前握手；还有人站在高处热烈欢呼“中华人民共和国万岁！”“毛泽东万岁！”在阿巴罗阿演出时，观众散场后守在门口一定要和我们拉手；有的人还偷偷摸到后台从帐篷缝里伸出手来。在几内亚风景优美的疗养胜地达拉巴，执政的民主党基层组织书记热情洋溢地说：“亲爱的朋友，你们从这里每一个人笑容满面的表情上，就可以知道他们是如何地满意你们的到来。”的确，我们在几内亚，处处看到这样友好的表情。拉培地方白发飘拂的老乐师曾为我们弹奏“巴拉风”——一种音色清脆的椰木琴；妇女们随着乐曲的节奏载歌载舞，跳到最兴奋的时候，索性摘下头巾、踢掉拖屐，光脚在灼热的砂地上踏着拍子，高呼“中华人民共和国万岁！”开西多哥的波耶村的男女老幼在村长的率领下列队欢迎杂技团，还按照几内亚古老的风俗向杂技团献水、献“科拉”（一种能使神经兴奋的果品）、献全羊，这是当地对待贵宾的最崇高的礼节。
    我们通过半年多的直接接触，切实感到：中国人民同非洲人民由于具有受到帝国主义侵略、统治、压迫的共同的遭遇和共同的反对帝国主义的要求，所以彼此一见面就相互了解，有着一种亲如手足的感情。而非洲各国人民之所以如此热烈地欢迎杂技团，还因为他们把新中国当作可以依靠的朋友。几内亚的达拉巴行政区长官兼民主党书记强调说：“几中两国人民是反对帝国主义战线上的战友。”埃塞俄比亚情报部办公室主任曾一再向我们了解中国建设的经验。非洲的朋友们把杂技团的访问演出看成是对他们的支持。几内亚拉培地方的青年联盟义务劳动队领队就说：“几内亚独立以后，法国人、美国人、英国人、西班牙人，没有一个来的，而你们却从遥远的中国来到我们这个年青的国家，我们感谢你们的友谊和支持。”
    “六亿五千万中国人民的友谊和支持”，这是我们在整个访问演出期间博得掌声最热烈、反应最强烈的一句话。每当我们讲到“六亿五千万中国人民永远站在为民族解放而斗争的非洲兄弟这一边”，群众总是报以春雷般的鼓掌和发自内心的欢呼。杂技团在几内亚具有反对帝国主义光荣传统的大城坎康演出时，后台的一个工人听到我们的讲话，抑制不住内心的激动，一遍又一遍地用手在沙地上写着“六亿五千万”、“六亿五千万”……。开西多哥的行政长官说得好：“有了伟大的六亿五千万中国人民做我们的朋友，帝国主义又算得了什么！”
        “不是技术，而是魔术！”
    具有悠久历史传统、在解放以后又获得蓬勃发展的中国杂技艺术，这次在非洲四国赢得各阶层人士的赞扬和好评；上座率比任何外国演出团体都高，观众在当地人口中所占的比例是很大的。几内亚观众五万多人，占杂技团访问的九个城市人口总数的30％以上。在苏丹西部一个小城市的一次广场演出，观众多达八千多人。不少人是冒雨步行几十公里，专诚来欣赏中国杂技艺术的。
    埃塞俄比亚教育部助理兼剧场经理说，中国杂技艺术团演出的盛况，只有1956年访埃的中国文化艺术团能够与之相比；观众把剧场的大门都挤破了。在摩洛哥盛产磷酸盐的高瑞加矿区，大部分是矿工的观众以异常热烈的掌声表示他们对中国艺术的喜爱，散场后人们情不自禁地在门外高呼“中国万岁！”许多政界人士对我国杂技艺术表现出莫大的兴趣。苏丹情报与劳工部长法里德一连看了十一次，还派了十七名青年士兵来杂技团学习。埃塞俄比亚哈拉省长两次从三十公里以外的地方，携带全家来看我们的演出。
    中国的杂技艺术一时成为各城市人民群众的议论中心，报章杂志也纷纷发表评论。几内亚政府的新闻公报，以“友好的范例”为题发表评论，号召全国青年观看和学习杂技团的演出。几内亚舆论普遍称赞我国的杂技艺术是“集中地表现了中国劳动人民的聪明、机智、勤劳和勇敢”；认为“具有丰富想像力和高度精确的演技，看来似乎不是技术表演，而是魔术！”一家摩洛哥报纸谈到观众情绪的高涨说：“如果有一架计声器的话，它一定会被热烈的掌声所震裂。”摩洛哥“回声报”指出，“中国杂技艺术所以取得惊人的进步是由于这个国家的文化艺术遵循着毛泽东主席‘百花齐放，推陈出新’的方针”。
    非洲观众特别喜爱我们的音乐，其中很重要的一个原因是它同非洲民族的音乐有相似相通之处。苏丹陆军副总司令赞扬我们演出的特点之一，就是音乐完全是东方民族的，非常吸引人。苏丹好几位部长赞美我们的音乐，能够唤起双方情感的交流。
    非洲人民原是能歌善舞的民族，具有非凡的艺术才能；我们在访问演出期间，曾利用一切机会进行学习。每当我们演奏当地的民族音乐，台上台下打成一片，全场为之振奋。摩洛哥观众常随着中国乐器奏出的摩洛哥民歌曲调小声哼唱，摩洛哥国王也兴奋得跟着打拍子。几内亚政府新闻公报总编辑评论我们演奏几内亚的民族乐曲说：“帝国主义、殖民主义者一贯鄙视几内亚音乐，中国人民却如此重视和能够欣赏我们的音乐，这是我们民族的骄傲。”
              谁也不能隔绝我们
    长期以来，非洲因为殖民主义的罪恶统治而被称为“黑暗大陆”；但是，随着非洲民族解放运动的蓬勃发展，独立国家的旗帜一面又一面地升起，殖民主义陷于土崩瓦解。只是他们死不甘心自己的失败，还在进行各种破坏活动，妄想在已经站起来的非洲人民头上，重新建立殖民者的“乐园”。
    像几内亚从1958年10月获得独立以后，法帝国主义在美帝国主义的支持下，曾不断以经济封锁、撤退技术人员、破坏物资设备、关闭商店等手段企图压迫几内亚低头。我们在肯地亚就看到一家法国殖民者经营的饭店，他们在被逐出时连水管都切断了。然而，几内亚人民丝毫没有动摇，几内亚政府坚决地进行了反封锁斗争，摆脱法帝国主义在经济上的控制。帝国主义者恼羞成怒，又偷运武器入境，阴谋武装颠覆几内亚政府、扼杀年青的共和国。几内亚政府坚决地扑灭了武装叛乱，给帝国主义以沉重的打击。在几内亚民主党总部举办的“武装叛乱实物展览会”上，陈列着从边境缴获的叛乱武器；美制的烈性炸药和手榴弹；西德造的手枪、步枪和定时炸弹；法国的电讯器材……。每一件武器和策划颠覆的文件都是帝国主义者无可狡赖的罪证。
    非洲人民珍视祖国的独立就像爱护自己的眼珠一样，他们反对帝国主义的昂扬斗志是很鼓舞人的。几内亚法拉那民主党的一位区委委员，在一次演出结束时登台对我们说：“我向你们宣誓，经过法国殖民主义几百年残暴统治的几内亚，在经济上是落后的，但几内亚的人民在政治上、思想上是进步的。我们坚决把反对帝国主义的斗争进行到底！”
    非洲人民同帝国主义作斗争，因为能得到六亿五千万中国人民的支持而感觉自豪。我们在友好访问中，时常听到这样的话：“中国人民的反帝斗争和建设成就，给非洲人民极大的鼓舞。”我们发现好多人读过或正在读毛泽东主席和刘少奇主席的著作。人们要求介绍中国革命与建设的经验；对我国的重大方针政策感到浓厚的兴趣。几内亚民主党达拉巴行政区书记告诉我们，读了毛主席论帝国主义和一切反动派是纸老虎的文献，大大增强了他们反对帝国主义的勇气和信心。他说：“这个文献使我们懂得了帝国主义不仅是应该反、可以反，而且是可以打倒的。”苏丹的学生跟我们说，苏丹青年都是反对西方、要求同中国友好的。
    帝国主义者当然十分痛恨非洲人民和中国人民这种同仇敌忾的感情，它们的手法，就是在非洲人民中间散布对于新中国的诬蔑歪曲的谣言。但是它们一切企图隔绝中国人民同非洲人民的友谊的卑鄙伎俩，是徒劳的。中国人民同非洲人民之间的友谊，是在反对帝国主义的共同斗争中结成的。这种战斗的友谊，决不是帝国主义的挑拨离间所能破坏的。
    我们刚从沸腾着反帝斗争浪潮的非洲大陆归来，非洲人民朝气勃勃的英姿、诚挚淳厚的友情，还鲜明地萦回我们的脑际；我们作为曾经受到塞古·杜尔总统盛情款待的中国客人，愿以满腔热情祝杜尔总统和代表团的全体贵宾，在访问期间身体健康，精神愉快！
  　中几两国人民的友谊万岁！
    中国和非洲人民的友谊万岁！
