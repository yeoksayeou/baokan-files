Anshan Iron and Steel No. 2 Steel Plant Overcomes Key Issues to Produce More Steel
　　Preparation Time Greatly Shortened; Daily Steel Production Increases by 100 to 600 Tons
　　(Based on a report from the Liaoning Daily) The Anshan Iron and Steel No. 2 Steel Plant's recent daily steel production records show an increase of 100 to 600 tons compared to before the rain and flood damage. The quality of the steel and the planned variety output rate have also generally reached new levels.
　　The workers of the No. 2 Steel Plant understand that concentrating efforts, attacking key points, and shortening the smelting time of each furnace of steel are the primary links in increasing production and practicing economy. They launched a competition focused on this link, with "each person contributing a plan, each shift tackling a problem." The workers of the Youth Solidarity Furnace set up a problem-solving competition board in front of the furnace. When they discovered key problems in shortening smelting time, they recorded them and competed to find solutions. In less than five days, they used methods such as preheating raw materials and spraying tar into the furnace to solve more than a dozen key production problems, such as the dampness of raw materials after the rain. The time for the first four processes of steelmaking (repairing the furnace, charging materials, heating, and adding molten iron) was quickly shortened from about five hours to three hours and twenty minutes. As soon as the news spread, the workers of each open hearth furnace immediately caught up. The No. 11 and No. 13 open hearth furnaces learned from and developed the experience of the Youth Solidarity Furnace, successively shortening the time for the first four processes to about two hours and forty minutes, so that the average smelting time of the entire plant was generally shortened by more than an hour, greatly improving the output of steel. Maintaining the furnace body well is another key to increasing steel production. In the race to catch up with each other, the workers discovered that the No. 15 open hearth furnace's experience in carrying out mass maintenance of the furnace body was good, and immediately helped to summarize it. Then, a competition to compare, learn from, catch up with, and surpass the No. 15 open hearth furnace was launched. The workers of the No. 15 open hearth furnace also organized an advanced experience transmission team, going to any open hearth furnace where the furnace body maintenance was not good to help solve the problem, so that the furnace body maintenance of many open hearth furnaces reached excellent standards, reducing unplanned hot repairs and cold repairs, and improving the operation rate.
　　In this vigorous movement to increase production and practice economy, the one-dragon collaboration competition between the No. 2 Steel Plant and its brother plants was even more enthusiastic. Through this new competition, the Anshan Iron and Steel Transportation Department, the Ironmaking Plant, the Ingot Plant, the Gas Plant, and the Water Supply Plant, as well as various brother steel rolling plants, all gave strong support to the No. 2 Steel Plant.
　　In this new upsurge of the production increase and economy practice competition, the leading cadres of the No. 2 Steel Plant went to the forefront of production, implementing political work to the workshops, management work to the workshops, and life service work to the workshops. At the same time, a competition evaluation committee was formed to check and evaluate the competition situation at any time, focusing on advanced examples, establishing models, and vigorously summarizing and promoting advanced experience, promoting the production increase and economy practice competition to develop more widely and deeply.

    鞍钢第二炼钢厂攻下关键多产钢
    准备时间大大缩短　每天多产钢一百到六百吨
    本报讯　据辽宁日报消息：鞍钢第二炼钢厂近来每天钢产纪录比暴雨和洪水袭击之前多产钢一百到六百吨，钢的质量和按计划品种出钢率也普遍达到了新的水平。
    第二炼钢厂的职工们懂得，集中力量，猛攻关键，缩短每炉钢的熔炼时间，是增产节约的首要一环。他们对准这一环节展开了“一人献一计，一班攻一关”的竞赛，青年团结炉的职工，在炉前设立一个攻关竞赛板，发现缩短熔炼时间的关键问题，就记下来，竞相设法解决，不到五天就用预热原料和往炉内喷焦油等办法，解决了雨后原料潮湿等十多个生产关键问题，把炼钢的前四道工序（补炉、装料、加热、兑铁水）的时间很快由过去五小时左右缩短到三小时二十分。消息刚刚传出，各平炉职工立即急起直追。十一、十三号等平炉学习并发展了青年团结炉的经验，相继把前四道工序的时间缩短到两小时四十分左右，使全厂平均熔炼时间普遍比过去缩短一个来小时，大大提高了钢的产量。维护好炉体是增加钢产的另一关键。职工们在你追我赶中，发现了十五号平炉开展群众性维护炉体的经验好，立即帮助总结，接着就掀起了比、学、赶、超十五号平炉的竞赛；十五号平炉职工也组织了先进经验传送队，哪个平炉炉体维护不好就到哪里去帮助攻关，使得许多平炉的炉体维护都达到优等，减少了非计划热修和冷修，提高了作业率。
    在这次声势浩大的增产节约运动中，第二炼钢厂职工与各兄弟厂之间的一条龙协作赛更为轰轰烈烈。通过这场新的竞赛，鞍钢运输部、炼铁厂、钢锭厂、燃气厂和给水厂以及各兄弟轧钢厂等，都给了第二炼钢厂大力的支援。
    在这场新的增产节约竞赛高潮中，第二炼钢厂领导干部纷纷走向生产第一线，实现政治工作到车间、管理工作到车间，生活服务工作到车间。同时组成了竞赛评比委员会，随时检查、评比竞赛情况，大抓先进，大树标兵，大力总结和推广先进经验，推动了增产节约竞赛越来越广泛、深入地发展。
