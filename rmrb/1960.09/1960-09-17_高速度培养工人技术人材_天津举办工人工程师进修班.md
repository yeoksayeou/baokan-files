    Tianjin Holds Worker Engineer Refresher Courses

    (Our Dispatch) Tianjin is holding worker engineer refresher courses to rapidly train worker technical talents who possess both practical experience and theoretical knowledge.

    In 1958, Tianjin's industrial leadership departments promoted a group of engineers from among the experienced technical workers in various factories. They possess rich production experience, but their cultural and theoretical knowledge is not systematic enough. In order to rapidly improve their cultural and scientific and technological theoretical level to meet the needs of continuous leaps forward in industrial production, the Municipal Science and Technology Association, the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, and the Machinery Bureau and the Electrical Machinery Bureau, under the leadership of the Municipal Party Committee, jointly organized a worker engineer refresher course for the mechanical industry system last December. The students attending the course were sixty-five worker engineers, worker technicians, and technicians from thirty-five mechanical factories in Tianjin. Most of them hold responsible positions such as factory director, production technology section chief, and workshop director. Many are industrial labor models and advanced producers. The longest work experience is thirty-eight years, and the shortest is about seven years. They have rich production experience and a relatively high level of political awareness; 64% are Communist Party members.

    The teaching plan for this refresher course is mainly based on the actual needs of production and the specific circumstances of the students' cultural level, etc., and was formulated after discussions and research by veteran workers, factory leaders, engineering and technical personnel, and professors from universities. The plan is to enable the students to reach the technical theoretical level of graduates of secondary technical schools in two years, and then further improve on this basis.

    In view of the students' rich production experience, low cultural level, and limited study time, teachers try to use practical examples from production and life to explain theoretical principles in an easy-to-understand manner, and pay attention to raising everyone's rich practical production experience to the level of theory for analysis. They adopt a method of explaining, reviewing, and consolidating simultaneously. After each teacher's lecture, the remaining time is used for classroom discussions, review, or homework. During classroom discussions, reviews, and homework, students with higher and lower cultural levels are organized into groups, and those who are capable are encouraged to act as teachers, carry out mutual assistance and learning, and solve the difficulties of uneven cultural levels among the students. In order to help students better digest and consolidate the theoretical knowledge they have learned outside of class, extracurricular study groups have also been established according to the students' production time and the distance of their residences. More than twenty part-time tutors have been hired in the units where the students are located, and engineers and technicians with higher technical theoretical knowledge are appointed to help the students review their lessons, answer difficult questions, and guide students' extracurricular studies. The students have a high degree of self-awareness and enthusiasm for learning, with an attendance rate of about 87%, and a maximum of 94%.

    After more than eight months of study in this worker engineer refresher course, the students have not only improved their theoretical knowledge, but also achieved great results in promoting production. Several students from the Tianjin Power Equipment Factory, after studying, further applied scientific theory to guide production and solved many key production problems. Wang Guanjia, a worker engineer at this factory, due to learning design theory knowledge such as analysis and calculation, not only greatly improved the design quality of transmission and material creation, but also saved a lot of materials. He said: "In the past, I only considered problems based on experience, and I was afraid to be sure when I spoke. Now I am confident."

    高速度培养工人技术人材
    天津举办工人工程师进修班
    本报讯　天津市举办工人工程师进修班，高速度地培养既有实际经验又有理论知识的工人技术人才。
    天津市工业领导部门1958年在各工厂的老技术工人中提拔了一批工程师。他们具有丰富的生产实践经验，但是文化理论知识不够系统。为了迅速地提高他们的文化和科学技术理论水平，以适应工业生产不断跃进的需要，市科学技术协会、市总工会和机械局、电机局在市委的领导下，在去年12月联合举办了一个机械工业系统的工人工程师进修班。参加学习的学员是来自天津市三十五个机械工厂的六十五名工人工程师和工人技师、技术员，他们大都担任工厂的厂长、生产技术科长、车间主任等负责工作，有不少是工业劳动模范和先进生产者。工龄最长的有三十八年，最短的七年左右。具有丰富的生产经验，政治觉悟也比较高，其中共产党员就占64％。
    这个进修班教学计划主要是根据生产需要和学员的文化水平等具体情况，经过老工人、工厂领导干部和工程技术人员以及高等学校的教授座谈研究而制订的。计划用两年的时间，使学员们达到中等技术专科学校毕业生的技术理论水平，然后在这个基础上再进一步提高。
    针对学员生产经验丰富、文化水平较低和学习时间较少等特点，教师讲课时尽量利用生产和生活中实际事例通俗地阐述理论原理，并注意把大家生产实际中的丰富经验，提升到理论上来加以分析，采取边讲解、边复习巩固的方式，每次教师讲课以后，余下的时间就进行课堂讨论或复习、做作业。在课堂讨论和复习、做作业时，把学员文化程度高和低的分别组织成为小组，提倡能者为师，开展互助互学，解决学员文化程度不齐的困难。为了帮助学员课外更好地消化和巩固已学到的理论知识，还根据学员的生产时间和居住的远近等具体情况，成立了课外学习小组。在各学员所在单位聘请了二十多位业余辅导员，由一些具有较高技术理论知识的工程师和技术员担任，帮助学员复习功课，解答疑难问题，指导学员课外学习。学员们学习的自觉性和积极性都很高，学习出席率达到87％左右，最高达到94％。
    这个工人工程师进修班，经过八个多月的学习，学员们不仅提高了自己的理论知识，而且在推动生产方面也取得了很大的效果。天津发电设备厂的几名学员，经过学习，进一步运用科学理论来指导生产，解决了很多生产关键问题。这个厂的工人工程师王冠甲由于学会了分析、计算等设计理论知识，不仅大大提高了传动、造材料等设计质量，而且节省了很多材料。他说：“过去只凭经验考虑问题，说出来不敢肯定。现在心里有底了。”
