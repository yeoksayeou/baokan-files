    Lingbi Weiji Commune
    Prepares to Expand Planting of "Pea Wheat"

    According to Xinhua News Agency, the Weiji Commune in Lingbi County, Anhui Province, plans to vigorously expand the mixed planting area of pea wheat in the autumn sowing wheat fields in order to fully exploit the potential of the land and increase grain production.

    Last year, the commune carried out mixed planting of peas and wheat on 34,700 mu of wheat fields. Compared with planting wheat alone under the same soil quality and cultivation conditions, the mixed planting of beans and wheat increased production by an average of more than 20%. After peas and wheat are mixed planted, the peas themselves contain rhizobia, which can absorb nitrogen from the air and supply the nutrients needed by the wheat. The wheat stalks are hard and upright, while the pea stalks are soft and weak. The wheat stalks can support the beans from lodging, which is conducive to ventilation and light transmission. Because peas and wheat can promote each other, mixed planting of beans and wheat has the characteristics of requiring little effort and producing large increases in yield. Regardless of the type of land on which it is sown, it can increase production.

    In order to further increase the yield of mixed planting of beans and wheat, the commune has formulated new yield-increasing measures on the basis of summarizing past yield-increasing experience, namely: do a good job in variety matching, prepare to mix all the peas with "Bima No. 1" wheat, which has hard stalks and high yield, to increase yield. Secondly, specifically plan the sowing ratio per mu to prevent uneven density. For example, on barren land, because there is less nitrogen-containing fertilizer, appropriately sow more bean seeds and fewer wheat seeds; on fertile land, because there is more nitrogen-containing fertilizer, sow more wheat seeds and fewer bean seeds. The commune will also appropriately increase the sowing amount by 10% to 20% compared to last year based on this year's water, fertilizer, and other conditions, in order to increase the yield per unit area.

    In order to complete the expansion plan for mixed planting of beans and wheat on time, the commune has prepared nearly 200,000 jin of pure white peas and other improved varieties, remade more than 960 deep plows, and prepared a large amount of base fertilizer for autumn sowing.

### 灵壁韦集公社  准备扩种“豌豆麦”

    准备扩种“豌豆麦”
    据新华社讯　安徽省灵壁县韦集公社在秋种小麦地里，计划大力扩大豌豆小麦混种面积，以便充分发挥土地潜力，增加粮食产量。
    这个公社去年在麦地里进行豌豆小麦混种的有三万四千七百亩，豆麦混种比在同等土质、同样的耕作条件下净种小麦，平均增产了二成以上。豌豆、小麦混种后，豌豆本身含有根瘤菌，它可以吸收空气中的氮素，供给麦子需要的养分；麦子茎秆硬、直立，而豌豆秸秆软弱，麦秆能支持豆子不倒伏，便于通风透光。由于豌豆和小麦可以相互促进，因此，豆麦混种就具有花力小，增产大的特点，不论在什么土地上播种，都可以增产。
    为了进一步提高豆麦混种的产量，这个公社在总结往年增产经验的基础上，制订了新的增产措施，即：做好品种搭配，准备将豌豆全部和秸秆硬、产量高的“碧蚂一号”小麦混种，以提高产量。其次具体规划好每亩下种比例，以防止稀稠不均。如在瘠薄的土地上，因含有氮素的肥料少，就适当多下豆种少下麦种；在肥沃的土地上，因含有氮素肥料多，就多下麦种少下豆种。公社还根据今年水、肥等条件，适当的将播种量比去年增加百分之十到二十，以提高单位面积产量。
    这个公社，为了按时完成豆麦混种的扩种计划，已准备纯白豌豆等良种近二十万斤，改制好深耕犁九百六十多张，还为秋种准备了大量的基肥。
