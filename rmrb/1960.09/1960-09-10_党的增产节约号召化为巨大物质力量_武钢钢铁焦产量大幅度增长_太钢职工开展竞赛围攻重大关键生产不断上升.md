The Party's Call for Increased Production and Conservation Transforms into Immense Material Strength
Wuhan Iron and Steel's Steel and Coke Production Increases Significantly
Taiyuan Iron and Steel Workers Launch Competition to Overcome Major Critical Production Bottlenecks, Output Continuously Rises

This newspaper reports that Wuhan Iron and Steel Company is experiencing a vigorous surge in the movement for increased production and conservation. All workers are simultaneously discussing plans, formulating measures, and taking active action, resulting in significant increases in the production of steel, iron, and coke in the second half of August compared to the first half. Comparing the second half of August with the first half, steel increased by 55.92%, iron increased by 24.46%, and coke increased by 11%. Since entering September, all workers have continued their efforts and achieved new successes.

During the discussion of the increased production and conservation plan, Wuhan Iron and Steel workers proposed many specific measures targeting key production areas and implemented the plans and measures down to the team and individual levels, launching a labor competition of mutual pursuit and surpassing. The workers of No. 1 open-hearth furnace carefully maintained the furnace body and reduced the furnace repair rate, not only extending the life of this open-hearth furnace, which had reached its planned repair period, but also allowing it to continue production, exceeding the August production plan by 4.1%. On August 31, the workers of No. 4 open-hearth furnace launched a race against time in quick steelmaking, with workers from each shift competing with each other, increasing their speed. Workers from teams C and D were the first to produce a furnace of steel in fourteen hours, setting a new record since the furnace was put into operation. Subsequently, workers from team B surpassed them with thirteen and a half hours. From late August, workers at the ironmaking plant launched a five-day battle to overcome key technologies. Leading cadres went to the front lines, working alongside the workers to identify, eliminate, and overcome obstacles, resulting in the rapid breakthrough of many key production areas. Ironmaking workers at blast furnaces No. 1 and No. 2 also launched a competition between furnaces, teams, and groups. Through the competition, many operation times were shortened. In the past, it took one hour to replace a pair of tuyeres. The Wang Sanhuo team of workers replaced one in twelve minutes under high temperatures. Due to the close coordination of processes such as furnace front and charging, output rose steadily, with each ten-day period surpassing the previous one. Since the second half of August, coke oven workers have steadily increased production on the basis of maintaining equipment.

To further deepen the movement for increased production and conservation centered on high steel output, Wuhan Iron and Steel workers held a mobilization rally on September 4, resolving to seize all work and catch up with the national advanced level in the shortest possible time.

Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, September 8th. All workers of Taiyuan Iron and Steel Company, with the goal of overcoming the three major key areas of raw materials and fuel, converter technology transformation, and equipment maintenance, launched a vigorous competition to ensure increased steel production. In the past month or so, a new situation of comprehensive and substantial increase in production has emerged. The average daily output of steel, iron, and steel products in August all increased significantly compared to July; the daily output level in early September increased significantly compared to August.

Since the beginning of this year, Taiyuan Iron and Steel Company's large blast furnaces, coke ovens, and power stations have been put into operation one after another. In addition, the masses of workers have vigorously carried out technological innovations, allowing the potential of the original production equipment to be fully utilized. From January to July, the main products such as steel, iron, and steel products all increased significantly compared to the same period last year. However, with the rapid increase in ironmaking production capacity, new imbalances have emerged in production. The company's Party Committee summarized the production experience of the first half of the year and clearly proposed at the end of July to focus on raw material and fuel production, accelerate converter transformation, and strengthen equipment maintenance to ensure the completion of the annual steel production plan. Subsequently, the company's Party Committee held Party representative meetings and worker representative conferences respectively, entrusting the production situation and tasks to the broad masses of workers for discussion, quickly launching a competition to overcome the above three major key areas.

On the basis of raising awareness and clarifying key production areas, the company also adopted strong organizational measures to strengthen leadership on the front line of production. They first focused on the internal links between various aspects of production, with the Party Committee's Secretary and Deputy Secretaries, managers, and other leading cadres forming Party Working Committees and Production Headquarters for the ironmaking, steelmaking, and rolling systems respectively, organizing workers to carry out competitions centered on overcoming the three major key areas. After the establishment of the Party Working Committee and Production Headquarters for the ironmaking system, they unified leadership over six production units serving ironmaking, including coking, transportation, and mining, concentrating efforts to overcome the raw materials and fuel barriers. In order to ensure that the blast furnaces had sufficient enriched materials, the mining plant, coking plant, and transportation departments organized workers to visit the ironmaking plant workers and improve their work according to the requirements of the ironmaking workers. Workers at the Dongshan and Xishan mining plants adopted a combination of indigenous and foreign methods in the mining face, building indigenous chutes and aerial cable transport lines, greatly exploiting equipment potential and significantly improving transportation efficiency. In the past month or so, the supply of limestone has surged, ensuring the needs of blast furnace ironmaking. The workers at the coking plant studied and promoted the advanced experience of "graded quenching" and "hot water quenching" to address the problems of high sulfur and ash content in coke. In August, the ash content of coke decreased by 0.04% compared to the previous month, and sulfur decreased by 0.02%, and the strength was improved, which played a significant role in improving the quality of pig iron. Transportation Department workers launched a high-speed, high-load, and one-topping-several high-transport-guaranteed high-yield competition, greatly exploiting the existing transportation potential and changing the situation where raw material transportation could not keep up with the needs of ironmaking.

    党的增产节约号召化为巨大物质力量
    武钢钢铁焦产量大幅度增长
    太钢职工开展竞赛围攻重大关键生产不断上升
    本报讯　武汉钢铁公司掀起蓬蓬勃勃的增产节约运动。全体职工边讨论计划，边制定措施，边积极行动，使8月下半月的钢、铁和焦炭产量都比上半月有大幅度增长。8月下半月和上半月比较，钢增长55.92％，铁增长24.46％，焦增长11％。进入9月份以后，全体职工再接再厉，又取得了新的成绩。
    武钢职工在讨论增产节约计划中，针对生产关键提出了许多具体措施，并且把计划、措施一直贯彻到班组、个人，开展了你追我赶的劳动竞赛。一号平炉工人精心维护炉体、降低炼炉率，不仅使这座到了计划检修期的平炉延长了寿命，仍然参加生产，而且超额4.1％完成了8月份的生产计划。四号平炉工人在8月31日开展了争分夺秒的快速炼钢表演赛，各班工人你追我赶，速度越来越快。丙、丁班工人首先以十四小时炼出一炉钢，创造了这座平炉开炉以来的新纪录。接着，乙班工人又以十三小时半超过了他们。炼铁厂工人从8月下旬开始，以五天为一战役，开展了贯彻新技术的攻关竞赛。领导干部分赴前线，和工人一道抓关、排关、攻关，使不少生产关键迅速突破。一、二号高炉炼铁工人还开展了炉与炉、班与班、组与组的竞赛。通过竞赛，许多操作时间都缩短了。过去换一对风口需要一个小时。王三货小组工人在高温之下，十二分钟换了一个。由于炉前、装料等工序环环扣紧，产量节节上升，一旬高过一旬。焦化厂职工8月下半月以来，在维护好设备的基础上，使产量稳步上升。
    为进一步深入开展以钢铁高产为中心的增产节约运动，武钢职工在9月4日集会誓师，决心抓紧各项工作，在最短期内赶上全国先进水平。
    新华社太原8日电　太原钢铁公司全体职工，以围攻原料和燃料、转炉技术改造、设备维修三个重大关键为目标，开展了轰轰烈烈的保证钢铁增产的竞赛。最近一个多月来，生产出现了全面大幅度上升的新局面。8月份钢、铁、钢材的平均日产水平都比7月份增长很多；9月初的日产水平又比8月份有很大增长。
    今年以来，太原钢铁公司大型高炉、焦炉、电站相继投入生产，再加上职工群众大搞革新技术，使原有生产设备潜力得到充分发挥，1至7月份钢、铁、钢材等主要产品都比去年同期有大幅度增长。但是，随着炼铁生产能力的迅速增大，生产中出现了新的不平衡。公司党委总结了上半年的生产经验，在7月底明确提出了大抓原料、燃料生产，加速转炉改造，加强设备维修，以确保完成全年钢铁生产计划。接着，公司党委分别召开党代表会、职工代表大会，把生产形势、任务交给广大职工讨论，迅速地掀起了围攻上述三大关键的竞赛。
    在提高思想、明确生产关键的基础上，公司还采取了强有力的组织措施，加强生产第一线的领导。他们首先针对生产各个环节的内在联系，由公司党委正副书记、经理等领导干部，分别组成了炼铁、炼钢、轧钢系统党的工作委员会和生产指挥部，组织职工开展以围攻三大关键为内容的竞赛。炼铁系统成立了党的工作委员会、生产指挥部以后，统一领导炼焦、运输、矿山等六个为炼铁服务的生产单位，集中力量围攻原料、燃料关。为了保证高炉有足够的精料，采矿厂、焦化厂、运输部分别组织工人拜访炼铁厂职工，按炼铁职工要求，改进自己工作。东山、西山两个采矿厂职工在采矿工作面采用土洋结合方法，建成土溜槽、高空索道运输线，使设备潜力大大发挥，运输效率显著提高，最近一个多月来石灰石供应量猛增，保证了高炉炼铁需要。焦化厂职工针对焦炭含硫高、灰份大的问题，学习、推广了“分级消火”、“热水消火”的先进经验，8月份焦炭灰份比上月降低了0.04％，硫降低了0.02％，并且提高了强度，对提高生铁质量起了很大作用。运输部职工开展多拉快跑、一顶几的高运保高产竞赛，大大发挥了现有运输潜力，改变了原料运输赶不上炼铁需要的局面。
