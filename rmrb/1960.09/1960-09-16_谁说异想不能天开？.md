    Who Says Wild Ideas Can't Come True?
	Fuqing City Transportation Worker Liu Deyuan
    We transportation workers were looked down upon in the old society. All the old society left us was a carrying pole and two ropes. We were poor, but under the leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, we were poor but ambitious. This is exactly what Chairman Mao instructed us: poverty gives rise to the desire for change, to work, to revolution.
    Our Cangshan Brigade of the Fuqing City Transportation Company mainly handles grain transportation. The Cangshan area has many slopes, and in the past, grain was transported by carrying it on shoulders up steep slopes and stone steps because carrying it with a pole was inconvenient. The entire brigade of forty-eight people could only transport more than two thousand bags of grain a day, and it was extremely tiring. In this mass campaign of technical innovation and technical revolution, as soon as the Party issued a call, our transportation workers immediately put forward the slogan "Divorce from carrying poles and ropes." Everyone wanted to design and create a "bag pulling machine" to hoist grain bags more than five meters high from the ship, then pass them through more than a dozen houses, and send them directly to the warehouse. Realizing "grain bags flying across the sky" certainly had many difficulties. We had no materials, no tools, and no technology. At the time, some people didn't believe we could succeed, saying we were having "wild ideas." However, we didn't think so. Chairman Mao said: In the face of the Chinese working people with their soaring spirit, mountains bow their heads and rivers make way. These words gave us great encouragement. Everyone said that we dare to think and dare to do, and it's not just "wild ideas." Since we have soaring enthusiasm and a pragmatic spirit, why can't we make "the sky open"? Therefore, under the leadership and support of the Party, we worked as transportation workers during the day and as machinists and carpenters after work to innovate. This group of "poor sticks" fought for two months, installing and testing, testing and modifying, and finally realized the miracle of "grain bags flying across the sky." Then, everyone created a conveyor belt to transport the grain bags directly from the wharf to the rice mill. Now, our transportation workers have also become workers operating machines. The entire brigade has been reduced from forty-eight people to nine, saving a large number of laborers to support other production departments, and the total output has doubled.
    Through this technical innovation, we deeply realized that Chairman Mao's thought is the power for us to win victory. Daring to think and daring to do is the style of our working class. People with conservative ideas regard our "daring to think" as "wild ideas." They do not understand that with the revolutionary spirit and practical spirit of the working class, any difficulty can be overcome, and "wild ideas" can "come true"!

    谁说异想不能天开？	福州市搬运工人　刘德元
    我们搬运工人在旧社会里是被人看不起的。旧社会给我们留下的只有一根扁担、两条绳。我们穷，但在党和毛主席的领导下，穷而有志。这正是毛主席指示我们的：穷则思变，要干，要革命。
    我们市搬运公司仓山大队，主要的任务是搬运粮食。仓山地区坡道多，过去运粮食由于挑担不方便，都是靠肩膀驮着走上陡坡和石阶。整个大队四十八个人，一天只能运二千多包粮食，而且十分劳累。在这次全民大闹技术革新和技术革命运动中，党一发出号召，我们搬运工人便立刻提出“和扁担绳子离婚”的口号。大伙儿要设计搞出个“拉包机”，把粮包从船上吊上五米多高，再穿过十几间房屋，直接送到仓库去。要实现“粮包凌空飞渡”，困难确实不少。一无材料，二无工具，三无技术。当时有人不相信我们能搞成，说我们“异想天开”。但是，我们不这样想。毛主席说：在具有冲天气概的中国劳动人民面前，高山低头，河水让路。这些话给了我们极大的鼓舞。大家说，我们是敢想敢干，不是什么“异想”。我们既然有冲天的干劲，求实的精神，为什么不能叫“天开”呢？于是，在党的领导和支持下，我们上班生产当搬运工人，下班革新当机工、木工。我们这班“穷棒子”奋战了两个月，装了试，试了改，终于实现了“粮包凌空飞渡”的奇迹。接着，大家又搞个输送带，把粮包从码头直接地运送到碾米机旁。现在，我们搬运工人也成了操纵机器的工人了。全大队从四十八人，减少到九个人，节约出大批劳动力去支援别的生产部门，总产量还翻了一番。
    通过这次技术革新，我们深深地体会到毛主席的思想就是我们赢得胜利的力量。敢想敢干是我们工人阶级的风格。具有保守思想的人把我们的“敢想”看成是“异想”，他们不了解，有了工人阶级的革命气概和实干精神，任何困难都可以克服，“异想”也就能够“天开”！
