Title: The Anti-Rent Increase and Anti-Eviction Struggle of the British People

On September 6th, about six thousand people in London held a massive demonstration. In the approximately one-kilometer-long procession, the slogan "Support Don Cook!" was repeatedly shouted. Several thousand demonstrators also went to Don Cook's house and held a rally, listening to Don Cook's speech to them.

Who exactly is Don Cook? What exactly did he encounter that aroused the concern and support of so many people in London?

		Don Cook's Plight
It turns out that Don Cook is just an ordinary resident of the St. Pancras district of London. He is facing the danger of being evicted from his home for opposing the landlord's rent increase.

August 28th was the deadline for him to be ordered to move out of his residence. Because the landlord sued him for refusing to increase the rent, and the court made this decision. If he disobeyed this decision again, the court would forcibly evict him.

However, Don Cook decided to take action against the eviction. He said, "I will protect my family to the very end." He had his wife and three children stay with other people, stored more than a month's worth of food, and then surrounded the house with barbed wire and blocked the door with furniture. He also placed a flare in the window, ready to signal other tenants for support when the eviction officers arrived.

		Tens of Thousands of Victims
Don Cook's struggle has received widespread concern and support, which is by no means accidental. Because rent increases and evictions have become a common threat to the vast majority of London citizens.

Recently, letters from citizens protesting rent increases and evictions have been constantly seen in London newspapers. In crowded places such as underground trains, parks, and markets, discussions about rent increases and evictions can also be frequently heard.

According to London newspapers, thousands of families receive eviction or rent increase notices every month. And the proportion of rent increases is extremely alarming, sometimes even tripling or quadrupling. This is indeed a major challenge for the working people.

The implementation of rent increases and evictions is not limited to privately owned houses and private real estate companies. Even the public housing owned by the municipal government is constantly increasing rents. The municipal government's new rental plan stipulates that rents will be increased in two phases within one year. The first phase, starting from January this year, will increase by ten shillings per week; the second phase, starting from July, will increase by twelve shillings and sixpence per week. It is said that there will be another increase starting in January next year.

		"The Most Despicable Rental Plan"
The threat of rent increases and evictions faced by the British working people is the result of the Conservative government's sinful policy of cutting the working people to fill the pockets of the bourgeoisie.

As early as 1957, the Conservative government abolished the Rent Control Act. As a result, rent restrictions were lifted on more than 800,000 houses in London and the surrounding areas. Thus, the rent burden on millions of British families was greatly increased. Because the British people strongly opposed the abolition of the Rent Control Act, there was also a big quarrel in Congress over this issue. However, this was just empty talk, and the rent increase problem was not resolved.

Who knew that in January of this year, the Conservative government implemented a new rental plan. According to this plan, all houses that have been sold by the landlord or vacated by the tenants are classified as "exempt from control." After the house is resold, as long as the new landlord notifies the tenant one month in advance, the tenant must move out on time; otherwise, the landlord can increase the rent at will. As a result, a large number of landlords have benefited, and the difficulties of the working people have increased. Therefore, the British people call this rental plan "the most despicable rental plan."

		Struggling to Defend the Right to Live
Faced with this "most despicable rental plan," the British working people began to organize and defend their right to live. Tenants' associations have been established in various districts of London, and tenants' and residents' associations have also been established nationwide. These organizations united the broad masses to launch a struggle to refuse rent increases and oppose evictions. Don Cook, who is resolutely refusing eviction, is the leader of the St. Pancras Tenants' Association.

The day before the march and demonstration in St. Pancras, more than 400 tenants from various districts of London who had been threatened by high rents and evictions marched in the city center to protest the abolition of the Rent Control Act. On the evening of September 7th, more than 500 tenants in London held a rally at Westminster Central Hall. Tom Vernon, chairman of the National Tenants' and Residents' Association, condemned the Conservative government's high rent policy at the meeting. He called on all tenants across the country to firmly unite in the struggle, emulate Don Cook's fighting example, and force the government to change its rent policy. On September 11th, London tenants held another demonstration and unanimously passed a resolution stating that they would never yield to the landlords and would never move out of their original homes.

With the support of people from all walks of life, Don Cook has persisted for more than twenty days without moving out. Many tenants in various districts of London who are due to be forced to move out have also followed Don Cook's example and resolutely fought the landlords, refusing to move out of their original homes.

In order to strengthen unity and expand the strength of the struggle, more than 50 tenants' associations in various districts of London are scheduled to establish a city-wide tenants' federation on the 19th. The National Tenants' and Residents' Association has decided to hold a mass rally in Trafalgar Square on October 16th to show the people's determination to oppose "the most despicable rental plan."

In the capitalist world, internal contradictions are intensifying. The British people's struggle against rent increases and evictions is one aspect of this.

### 英国人民的反加租、反迫迁斗争

　　英国人民的反加租、反迫迁斗争
    9月6日，伦敦约六千人举行了一次声势浩大的示威游行。在长约一公里的游行队伍中，不时发出“支持唐·库克！”的口号。几千名示威者还到唐·库克家的门前，举行了集会，并且听了唐·库克对他们所作的讲话。
    唐·库克究竟是谁呢？他究竟遭遇到什么事情，因而引起伦敦那末多人的关怀和支持呢？
            唐·库克的遭遇
    原来，唐·库克不过是伦敦圣潘克拉斯区的一个普通居民。他由于反对房主增加房租而正面临被逐出住所的危险。
    8月28日，是他被勒令迁出住所的限期。因为，房主向法庭控告他拒绝加租，而法庭就作出了这样的决定。如果他再违抗这个决定，法庭就要把他强行驱逐。
    但是，唐·库克决定用行动反对迫迁。他说：“我要保护我的家庭，直到最后为止。”他让妻子和三个孩子寄居在旁人家里，自己储备了一个多月的粮食，然后用铁丝网把住房围起来，并用家具堵塞大门。他还在窗口放了一个信号弹，准备等执行迫迁的人到来时用信号要求别的房客前来支援。
            成千成万的受害者
    唐·库克的斗争，受到人们广泛的关怀和支持，决不是偶然的。因为，加租、迫迁，已经成为伦敦广大市民面临的共同威胁了。
    最近一个时期来，在伦敦的报纸上，不断可以看到市民抗议加租和迫迁的投书。在地下火车、公园、市场等群众聚集的地方，也都经常可以听到对加租和迫迁问题的谈论。
    据伦敦报纸估计，每月都有成千个家庭接到催迁或加租的通知。而房租增加的比例极为惊人，有时甚至一加而为三、四倍。这对于劳动人民来说，实在是一个大难关。
    实行加租、迫迁的，不仅限于一般私人房东和私营地产公司所有的房屋，连市政府所有的平民房屋，也在不断加租。市政府的新租务计划规定，一年内分两期加租，第一期从今年1月份起，每周增加十先令；第二期自7月份起，每周再增加十二先令六便士。据说，明年1月份起还要再加。
          “最卑鄙的租务计划”
    英国劳动人民面临的加租和迫迁的威胁，是保守党政府为了资产阶级腰包而拿劳动人民开刀的罪恶政策的结果。
    早在1957年，保守党政府废除了房租管制法。这样，在伦敦以及附近地区，就有八十多万家的房屋取消了房租限制。于是，英国几百万家庭的房租负担大大加重了。由于英国人民强烈表示反对废除房租管制法，国会里也为这个问题大吵大嚷过。然而，这不过是一阵空谈而已，加租问题并没有解决。
    谁知道，今年1月，保守党政府又实施了一项新的租务计划，根据这个计划，凡是被房主转卖或住客已迁出的房屋，房租一律列入“免除管制”之列。房屋转卖后，新房东只要在一个月以前通知房客，房客就须如期迁出，否则，房东可以随意加租。这样一来，大批房主都得其所哉，而劳动人民的困难更增加了。因此，英国人把这个租务计划称为“最卑鄙的租务计划”。
    为保卫生活权利而斗争
    面对着这个“最卑鄙的租务计划”，英国劳动人民开始组织起来，保卫自己的生活权利。在伦敦各区，都成立了房客协会，在全国，也成立了房客和居民协会。这些组织，团结着广大群众展开了拒绝加租、反对迫迁的斗争。正在坚决拒绝迫迁的唐·库克，就是圣潘克拉斯区房客协会的领导人。
    就在圣潘克拉斯区发生游行示威的前一天，来自伦敦各区的受到过高房租和驱逐威胁的四百多名房客，在市中心举行了游行，抗议废除房租管制法。9月7日晚上，伦敦五百多名房客又在威斯敏斯特中央大厅举行集会。全国房客和居民协会主席托姆·维农在会上谴责保守党政府的高额房租政策，他要求全国所有的房客在斗争中坚定地团结起来，仿效唐·库克的战斗榜样，并迫使政府改变房租政策。9月11日，伦敦房客又举行示威游行，并且一致通过决议，表示决不向房东让步，决不迁出原住房屋。
    在各界人民的支持下，唐·库克已经坚持二十多天，没有迁出。伦敦各区许多到期被迫要迁出的房客，也都效法唐·库克的榜样，坚决同房东进行斗争，不迁出原住的房屋。
    为了加强团结，壮大斗争的力量，伦敦各区五十多个房客协会定于19日成立全市房客联合会。全国房客和居民协会决定，将在10月16日在特拉法加广场举行群众集会，显示人民反对“最卑鄙的租务计划”的决心。
    在资本主义世界，内部矛盾正在日益加剧。英国人民反加租、反迫迁斗争，就是其中的一个侧面。
