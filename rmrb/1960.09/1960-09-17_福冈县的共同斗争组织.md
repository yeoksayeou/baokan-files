    Fukuoka Prefecture's Joint Struggle Organization	Lan Hai
    In the struggle against the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty," the Japanese people, under the leadership of the National Council Against Revision of the "Security Treaty," organized more than 2,000 joint struggle organizations throughout the country. Currently, these joint struggle organizations are developing into long-term united front organizations to abolish the "Security Treaty."
    The joint struggle organization in Fukuoka Prefecture (equivalent to a province in our country) is one of the representative joint struggle organizations in Japan. As of July 31 this year, 294 joint struggle organizations against the "Security Treaty" have been organized in Fukuoka Prefecture. Among them, in addition to the prefecture-wide joint struggle organization (Fukuoka Prefectural People's Joint Struggle Council for the Abolition of the "Security Treaty"), there are 27 large regional organizations, 253 town and village organizations, 10 organizations within enterprises such as coal mines and post offices, and 10 other joint struggle organizations. All regional joint struggle organizations have the participation of the Japanese Communist Party, the Socialist Party, and local trade unions and other democratic groups. The joint struggle organizations within enterprises also center on the activities of Communist Party members and Socialist Party members.
    Like other parts of Japan, Fukuoka Prefecture has successively held 22 unified actions against the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty." Leading these unified actions and becoming the center of activity are the nearly 300 joint struggle organizations mentioned above. In each unified action, mass rallies were held in about 50 locations throughout the prefecture. Fukuoka Prefecture collected nearly 600,000 signatures petitioning against the "Security Treaty," demanding the resignation of the Kishi Nobusuke cabinet, and the dissolution of the Diet. Communist Party members and non-Party activists also collected 170,000 signatures for protests to the Japanese and U.S. governments initiated solely by the Japanese Communist Party. During the three consecutive national general strikes in June, 280,000 workers from coal mines, national railways, post offices, telegraph offices, and private railways participated. Japan's largest coal mine, the Mitsui zaibatsu's Miike coal mine, and Japan's largest monopoly capital enterprise, which is also the largest steel company, Yawata Iron & Steel Works, are both located in Fukuoka Prefecture. As everyone knows, the Miike coal mine's union has launched a long-term strike since January of this year to oppose the Mitsui zaibatsu's "management rationalization plan" which involves mass layoffs, increased labor intensity, and wage cuts. The union of Yawata Iron & Steel Works, which has 70,000 workers, was unable to participate in the political strike against the "Security Treaty" due to sabotage by right-wing forces, but 10,000 workers participated in local rallies and demonstrations of unified action. The youth action team of the Yawata Iron & Steel Works union also formed a patrol team according to the requirements of the Fukuoka Prefecture joint struggle organization to support the strike of the national railway workers.
    Through participating in joint struggle organizations and carrying out unified actions, people of all strata have been educated and tempered. For example, the Fukuoka Prefecture joint struggle organization itself has gradually transformed from a liaison office for various groups into a leading organ for planning and implementing unified actions. The Fukuoka Insurance Bureau's union was originally a union with conservative tendencies, had not joined the Fukuoka Prefecture's "Sohyo" organization, and rarely participated in local mass rallies. However, by participating in mass rallies and demonstrations against the "Security Treaty," members of this union realized the importance of the solidarity of the working people and are already discussing joining "Sohyo."
    The Itazuke area of Fukuoka City, the capital of Fukuoka Prefecture, is the location of a U.S. Air Force base. The people of Fukuoka Prefecture are actively engaged in the struggle against the U.S. military base. The 247 workers of the Kasuga-haru Special Telegraph and Telephone Bureau, which belongs to the Itazuke U.S. Air Force Base, participated in the regional joint struggle organization. Based on their personal experience of being oppressed by the U.S. military on a daily basis, they were able to quickly recognize the aggressive essence of the "Security Treaty," and therefore participated very enthusiastically in unified actions. After the U.S. and Japanese reactionaries unilaterally announced the "entry into force" of the new U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" on June 23, the attitude of the American soldiers at the base towards Japanese workers became even more arrogant and rude. The U.S. military authorities even planned to dismiss participants in the peace movement at the Kasuga-haru Special Telegraph and Telephone Bureau. Only after the trade union organization discussed the matter and decided to strengthen solidarity and resist did they finally defeat this conspiracy of the U.S. military authorities. The union also decided not to accept work exceeding the standard workload and refused to provide extra services for the U.S. military. According to a recent opinion poll conducted by the union among all its members, almost everyone clearly expressed their willingness to fight against the U.S. military base.
    The Fukuoka Prefecture joint struggle organization was originally named the Fukuoka Prefectural Joint Struggle Council for Preventing Revision and Striving for Abolition of the "Security Treaty," but after the U.S. and Japanese reactionaries exchanged the "instruments of ratification" of the new U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" on June 23, in order to adapt to the new situation of the struggle, it was renamed the Fukuoka Prefectural People's Joint Struggle Council for the Abolition of the "Security Treaty." It put forward the following three points as the current struggle guidelines: 1. Clearly define that the enemies of the Japanese people are U.S. imperialism and Japanese monopoly capital and their agents; 2. Further strengthen the cooperation between the Socialist Party and the Communist Party, these two parties are the core forces for strengthening and developing the joint struggle organization; 3. Closely combine with the efforts to abolish the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" and further develop the movement to restore diplomatic relations between Japan and China and strengthen the friendship between the peoples of Japan, China, and the Soviet Union. In the past, the members of the joint struggle council's secretariat were only the prefectural "Sohyo" and the prefectural peace committee. Now, in order to strengthen the leadership of the political parties, the secretariat is composed of representatives from the Communist Party, the Socialist Party, and the prefectural "Sohyo." The purpose of this reorganization of the Fukuoka Prefecture joint struggle organization is to transform this organization into a lasting united front organization for the struggle for independence, peace, democracy, and neutrality. All joint struggle organizations in Fukuoka Prefecture are looking to this direction and are carrying out reorganization and strengthening work.
    At the end of July, the Fukuoka Prefectural People's Joint Struggle Council for the Abolition of the "Security Treaty" issued a document entitled "Analysis of the Current Situation and Struggle" to various joint struggle organizations, trade unions, farmers' associations, and peace groups within the prefecture. This document exposed the Ikeda cabinet's conspiracy to intensify its suppression of the people's struggle before the general election and to promote the reactionary and traitorous policy of the U.S.-Japan military alliance and U.S.-Japan "economic cooperation," calling on people from all walks of life to further strengthen the struggle. Currently, the Fukuoka Prefectural People's Joint Struggle Council has listed the Miike workers' struggle, opposition to the Ikeda cabinet's suppression measures, protest against the landing of the U.S. military's RB-47 spy plane at Itazuke base, and strengthening the farmers' struggle as current tasks, and is conducting extensive mobilization among people from all walks of life, hoping to advance step by step towards the long-term goal of abolishing the "Security Treaty" through these struggles.

### 福冈县的共同斗争组织

    福冈县的共同斗争组织	蓝海
    日本人民在反对日美“安全条约”的斗争中，在中央的阻止修改“安全条约”国民会议的领导下，全国各地组织了两千多个共同斗争组织。目前，这些共同斗争组织正在发展为争取废除“安全条约”的长期性统一战线组织。
    福冈县（相当我国的省）的共同斗争组织是日本有代表性的共同斗争组织之一。到今年7月31日为止，福冈县内已经组织了二百九十四个反对“安全条约”的共同斗争组织。其中除了全县性的共同斗争组织（废除“安全条约”福冈县民共同斗争会议）之外，还有二十七个大地区的组织、二百五十三个镇村的组织、十个煤矿和邮局等企业内的组织，以及十个其他方面的共同斗争组织。所有地区性的共同斗争组织，都有日本共产党、社会党和当地工会及其他民主团体参加。企业内的共同斗争组织也以共产党员和社会党员的活动为中心。
    和日本全国各地一样，福冈县也先后举行了二十二次反对日美“安全条约”的统一行动。领导这种统一行动并成为活动中心的，就是上述近三百个共同斗争组织。每次统一行动，全县约五十个地方都举行群众大会。福冈县共征集了近六十万个反对“安全条约”、要求岸信介内阁下台和解散国会的请愿签名。共产党员和非党积极分子还征集了十七万个由日本共产党单独发起的向日本和美国政府抗议的签名。6月间连续举行的三次全国性总罢工，有煤矿、国营铁道、邮局、电报局和私营铁道等企业的二十八万名工人参加。日本最大的煤矿三井财阀的三池煤矿，日本最大的垄断资本企业同时也是最大的钢铁企业八幡制铁所，都在福冈县。大家知道，三池煤矿的工会从今年1月以来掀起长期罢工，反对三井财阀的大批解雇工人、加强劳动强度和降低工资的“经营合理化方案”。拥有七万名工人的八幡制铁所的工会，虽因右派势力破坏没能参加反对“安全条约”的政治罢工，但是有一万名工人参加了统一行动的地方集会和示威游行。八幡制铁所工会的青年行动队，还按照福冈县共同斗争组织的要求组成纠察队支援国营铁道工人的罢工。
    经过参加共同斗争组织和进行统一行动，各阶层人民都受到了教育和锻炼。比如，福冈县的共同斗争组织本身就是由原来各团体的事务联系机关逐渐变成计划和实行统一行动的领导机关的。福冈保险局的工会原是一个带有保守倾向的工会，没有加入福冈县的“总评”组织，也很少参加地区的群众大会。但是，由于参加了反对“安全条约”的群众大会和示威游行，这个工会的会员体会到劳动人民团结的重要性，已经在讨论加入“总评”的问题了。
    福冈县首府福冈市的板付地区是美国空军基地。福冈县人民积极进行反对美国军事基地的斗争。属于板付美国空军基地的春日原特别电报电话局的二百四十七名工人参加了地区的共同斗争组织。他们基于日常遭受美军压迫的切身体验，能够很快地认清“安全条约”的侵略实质，因而非常热心地参加了统一行动。当美日反动派片面宣布新日美“安全条约”“生效”后，基地内的美国军人对待日本工人的态度变得更加蛮横粗暴了。美军当局甚至策划解雇春日原特别电报电话局的和平运动参加者。只是工会组织经过讨论，决定加强团结进行抵制，终于击败了美军当局的这一阴谋。工会并且决定不接受超过标准作业量的工作，拒绝额外替美军服务的事情。据最近这里的工会在全体会员中所作的一次舆论调查，几乎所有的人都明确表示要为反对美国军事基地而进行斗争。
    福冈县的共同斗争组织原名阻止修改和争取废除“安全条约”福冈县共同斗争会议，但在美日反动派6月23日交换新日美“安全条约”的“批准书”以后，为了适应新的斗争形势，改称废除“安全条约”福冈县民共同斗争会议。它提出了以下三点作为当前的斗争方针：一、明确日本人民的敌人是美帝国主义和日本垄断资本及其代理人；二、进一步加强社会党同共产党的合作，这两个党是加强和发展共同斗争组织的核心力量；三、同争取废除日美“安全条约”密切结合，进一步开展争取恢复日中邦交、加强日中、日苏人民友好的运动。过去共同斗争会议事务局的成员只有县“总评”和县和平委员会，现在为了加强政党的领导，事务局改由共产党、社会党和县“总评”三个单位的代表组成。福冈县共同斗争组织这次改组的目的，是要把这个组织变为争取独立、和平、民主、中立斗争的持久性统一战线组织。福冈县的所有共同斗争组织都向这个方向看齐，纷纷进行改组和加强的工作。
    废除“安全条约”福冈县民共同斗争会议，7月底向县内各个共同斗争组织、工会、农民协会与和平团体发出了“对当前形势的分析及斗争”的文件。这个文件揭露了池田内阁阴谋在大选前加紧打击人民斗争和推进日美军事同盟与日美“经济合作”的反动卖国政策，号召各界人民进一步加强斗争。目前，福冈县民共同斗争会议，已把三池工人斗争、反对池田内阁镇压措施、抗议美军RB—47型间谍飞机在板付基地着陆和加强农民斗争列为当前的任务，在各界人民中间进行广泛动员，希望通过这些斗争一步一步地朝着实现废除“安全条约”的长期目标前进。
