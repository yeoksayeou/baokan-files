Xinhua News Agency report: Zan He, a Tibetan female herder from Changmu Commune, Guide County, Qinghai Province, has achieved an annual calving rate for two consecutive years with the 101 cows she tends. Last year, this group of cows produced 102 calves, and this year they produced 104 calves (including three cows that gave birth to twins at one time). Moreover, all the calves born in both years have survived and are healthy.

The reason why this group of cows can achieve one calf per year is the result of vigorous artificial estrus induction and insemination. In the local area, it is considered a matter of course that yaks only produce one calf every two years. In the past, herders would passively wait for the cows to naturally go into heat before allowing them to mate and become pregnant. This not only resulted in inconsistent timing of conception but also meant that some cows could not be fully impregnated. Since the Great Leap Forward, Zan He, based on the experience of using artificial estrus induction for ewes after lambing to achieve full impregnation and even two litters a year, has been injecting post-partum cows with estrus-inducing drugs and adopting various methods such as continuous induction and multiple matings. As a result, these cows quickly achieved full impregnation.

Strengthening feeding and management is a necessary condition for ensuring full impregnation of cows. In order to keep the cows strong and well-conditioned throughout the year, Zan He always carefully selects pastures, divides them into sections for rotational grazing, and adopts various methods such as grazing on plains in winter and spring, grazing on high mountains in summer and autumn, eating dew-covered grass early in the morning, eating flowers on the mountaintops at noon, and avoiding drinking melted ice water, to ensure that the cows are well-fed and watered. At the same time, during the lush grass season in summer and autumn, she also cuts and stores green grass for the cows. In the dry grass season of winter and spring, she supplements the cows' feed, so that they are fat and strong, making it easier for them to go into heat and conceive. After the cows become pregnant, Zan He pays even more attention to them, providing careful care. In order to prevent miscarriages and premature births, she often pays attention to dispersing and slowing down the herd during grazing; when entering and exiting the pen in the morning and evening, she prevents them from crowding and bumping into each other. In the severe cold season, she often ties the calves in her tent to protect them from the cold. Therefore, the group of cows she tends not only produces many offspring but also has a high survival rate.

### 女放牧员赞禾——创母牛繁殖高产纪录  百头母牛连续两年每年一产

    女放牧员赞禾——创母牛繁殖高产纪录
    百头母牛连续两年每年一产
    据新华社讯　青海省贵德县常牧公社藏族女放牧员赞禾饲放的一百零一头母牛，连续两年都达到了每年一产。这群母牛在去年产犊一百零二头，今年又产犊一百零四头（其中有三头母牛一次产了两犊），而且连续两年所产的仔都全部成活健壮。
    这群母牛其所以能够达到每年一产，是大搞人工催情配种的结果。牦牛两年一产，在当地被认为是天经地义的事情。过去牧民们都是坐等母牛自然发情，然后让其配种怀胎，这样不但受胎的时间先后不一，而且总是有一部分母牛不能全配满怀。大跃进以来，赞禾根据母羊产后进行人工催情热配，可以达到全配满怀，甚至可以一年两产等经验，对产后的母牛进行催情注射，并采取连续催、多次配等各种办法，果然使这些母牛很快地达到了全配满怀。
    加强饲放管理，是保证母牛全配满怀的必要条件。赞禾为了使母牛四季健壮，常年满膘，总是认真地选择草场，划片轮牧，并采取冬春放平滩、夏秋放高山，早吃露水草、午吃山顶花、不喝消冰水等各种办法，来保证母牛吃饱饮好。同时，她在夏秋的盛草季节，还为母牛打贮青草，到了冬春枯草季节，给母牛补饲，使母牛膘肥体壮，容易发情和受孕。母牛怀孕以后，赞禾更是关心备至，照顾周到。为了使母牛不流产和早产，在放牧中经常注意赶散、赶慢；早晚进出圈时，不让互相拥挤碰撞。在严寒季节，她经常把牛犊拴在自己的帐房里，使牛犊不受冻。因此，她饲放的这群母牛不但繁殖多，而且成活率也高。
