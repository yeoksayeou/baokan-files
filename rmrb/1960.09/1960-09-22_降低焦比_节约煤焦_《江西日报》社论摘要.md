　  Reducing Coke Ratio, Saving Coal and Coke
    --Excerpts from *Jiangxi Daily* Editorial

    Steel enterprises use the most coal. If we can use the least amount of coal and coke to refine the most steel, we can save a lot of coal and coke, increase the production of more steel, and at the same time better support the coal needs of all walks of life. We should also see that reducing the coke ratio is closely related to increasing steel production, improving quality, and reducing costs. It's a win-win situation. The volume of the blast furnace itself has a certain limit. Using less coke allows for more ore and produces more iron. 80% of the sulfur content in pig iron comes from coke. Less coke used will reduce the sulfur content in pig iron accordingly, and the quality of pig iron can be significantly improved. At the same time, coke is the most important factor in the cost of pig iron. Less coke used means lower pig iron cost. The broad masses of workers (including family members) should realize that increasing production and saving are equally important. Saving coal and coke is consistent with achieving high yield, high quality, and low cost. Criticize the erroneous notions of "don't be afraid of wasting coke when making iron" and "less coke used can't produce more iron." Correct the passive waiting mentality of leaders in some steel enterprises who only emphasize the supply of coal and coke and do not focus on saving coal and coke, and make saving coal and coke one of the important criteria for evaluating the work of an enterprise.
    The places where steel enterprises lose the most coal and coke are: first, from the time coke is produced to the time it enters the blast furnace; and second, the coke ratio is high when iron is smelted in the furnace. In the mass movement to save coal and coke, we must focus on these two links. In order to avoid intermediate losses as much as possible, we must strengthen management and do a good job in crushing, transportation, loading and unloading, storage, and recycling. In order to reduce the furnace coke ratio as much as possible, it is necessary to implement every technical measure to reduce the coke ratio and all effective advanced experiences, including the use of the highest blast temperature, vigorously improving the grade of ore, increasing self-fluxing sintered ore, strictly grading the particle size into the furnace, and reducing the downtime rate, and a series of other measures.

　  降低焦比　节约煤焦
    ——《江西日报》社论摘要
    钢铁企业用煤最多，如果能够用最少的煤焦炼最多的铁，就可以大量节约煤焦，增产更多的钢铁，同时可以更好地支援各行各业的用煤需要。我们还应该看到，降低焦比和提高钢铁产量、提高质量和降低成本是紧密相关的，一举可以数得。高炉本身的容积有一定限度，少用焦炭，就可以多容矿石，多产生铁。生铁中含的硫分80％是焦炭带来的，焦用得少，生铁中的硫分也会随之减少，生铁质量就能够显著提高。同时，焦炭是构成生铁成本最主要的因素，焦炭用得少，生铁的成本就低。应该使广大职工（包括家属）都认识到增产和节约不可偏废，节约煤焦和实现高产、优质、低成本是一致的，批判“炼铁就不怕费焦炭”“少用焦就不能多产铁”的错误观念；纠正某些钢铁企业的领导人员只强调供应煤焦，而不着力节约煤焦的消极等待情绪，并把节约煤焦作为考核一个企业工作的重要标准之一。
    钢铁企业煤焦损失最多的地方，一是从出焦到进入高炉的过程中；一是炼铁入炉焦比高。在群众性的节约煤焦的运动中，必须抓住这两个环节。为了尽量避免中间损失，要加强管理，抓好破碎、运输、装卸、保管、回收工作。为了尽量降低入炉焦比，需要一条不漏地进行降低焦比的技术措施和各项行之有效的先进经验，包括使用最高风温、大力提高矿石品位、增加自熔性烧结矿、严格粒度分级入炉，以及减少休风率等一系列措施。
