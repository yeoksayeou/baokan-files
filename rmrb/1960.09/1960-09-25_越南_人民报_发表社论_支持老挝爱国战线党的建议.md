Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, September 24th: The Vietnamese "People's Daily" stated in an editorial today: "The Vietnamese people warmly support the just proposals made by the Central Committee of the Lao Patriotic Front in its letter of September 21 to the two chairmen of the Geneva Conference. These proposals aim to defend the legitimate rights of the Lao nation and to safeguard peace and security in Laos and Indochina."

The editorial emphasized: "The actions of American imperialism in interfering in the internal affairs of Laos have created an extremely dangerous situation in Laos, seriously undermining the 1954 Geneva Agreements on Laos, which guaranteed Laos' independence, territorial integrity, and policy of peaceful neutrality. These actions not only disrupt peace in Laos but also threaten peace and security in Indochina and Southeast Asia. These actions by the American imperialist bloc have aroused extreme indignation among the Lao people and dissatisfaction among public opinion in Southeast Asian countries."

The "People's Daily" editorial pointed out that in response to the above situation, in order to restore tranquility and order in Laos and safeguard peace in Indochina, it is urgently required to implement the proposal made by the Lao Patriotic Front in its letter of September 21 to the two chairmen of the 1954 Geneva Conference, requesting the two chairmen to take measures to stop the interference of American imperialism and its lackeys in Laos. The editorial said: In the current serious situation in Laos, it is clear that the International Commission has a responsibility to resume its activities to ensure the strict implementation of the Geneva Agreements and to maintain peace in Laos and Indochina. At the same time, it is also necessary to reconvene the conference of participating countries of the 1954 Geneva Conference. The editorial concluded: "As a neighbor of Laos and a signatory to the 1954 Geneva Agreements, the government and people of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam are particularly concerned about the current situation in Laos."

　　越南“人民报”发表社论
　　支持老挝爱国战线党的建议
    据新华社河内24日电　越南“人民报”今天在一篇社论中指出：“越南人民热烈支持老挝爱国战线党中央委员会9月21日写给日内瓦会议两位主席的信中所提出的正当建议，这些建议目的在于保卫老挝民族的正当权利，保卫老挝和印度支那的和平和安全。”
    社论强调指出：“美帝国主义干涉老挝内政的行动造成老挝极其危险的局势，严重地破坏了保证老挝独立、领土完整和和平中立政策的1954年关于老挝的日内瓦协议。这些行动不但破坏老挝的和平，而且还威胁了印度支那和东南亚的和平和安全。美帝国主义集团的这些行动引起了老挝人民的极度的愤恨和东南亚各国舆论的不满。”
    “人民报”的社论指出，针对上述情况，为了恢复老挝的安宁秩序，保卫印度支那和平，迫切要求实现老挝爱国战线党9月21日写给1954年日内瓦会议两主席的信中提出的要求两主席采取措施停止美帝国主义及其走狗对老挝的干涉的建议。社论说：在老挝当前严重形势下，很显然，国际委员会有责任恢复活动来保证日内瓦协议的严正履行，维护老挝和印度支那和平。和这同时，重新召开1954年日内瓦会议参加国的会议也是必要的。社论最后说：“作为老挝的邻邦和签订1954年关于日内瓦协议的一方，越南民主共和国政府和人民特别关心老挝当前局势。”
