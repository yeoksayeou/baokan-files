　　Ode to Jinggang Mountain
　　Zhang Yongmei
　　Silent rain in the rain and mist,飘飘的 mist, trees like shadows, covering the small road. In the quiet picture, a passionate song rings out. Clang, clang—the axe opening the mountain. Crash, crash—the falling tree. The car horn is like a bird singing in the empty mountain, and the sound of footsteps is like the pounding of war drums. Ah! No one can be seen in the deep mountains, but shouts shake the valleys! The old Red Guard soldiers are in the drizzling rain, and the prospecting team walks in the rain. Looking up at the rock head, you can't see the rock, only the mist and clouds flying around. The crashing sound of water shatters in the valley. The broken rock needs to be surveyed, how to climb this "bastion"? The old man leading the way steps forward, laughs, like thunder in the empty valley: "Don't look at the broken rock, I used to climb the rock like flying. When the Red Army sounded a horn, I raised a stone on the rock to smash the White bandits... Jiangxi song, Hunan tune, a flute playing on the rock. Comrades passing by stopped to listen, only saying that fairy music was floating!" The old man said, climbing to the sky, and disappeared into the rain and mist in a blink of an eye. A rope floated down from the air, and the melodious flute sound blew in the clouds... The red female singer is on Jinggang Mountain, and green bamboo forests are everywhere. Grandma Zhang lives in the green bamboo forest. Don't look at her gray hair—like the clouds on the top of the mountain. When she sings: Aiya lei! Big and small Five Wells, five major sentry posts,
    All echo back! Azaleas on Jinggang Mountain, she was the propagandist back then! Singing on the top of the mountain to help the battle—like a bugle shaking the mountain cliffs, the Red Army heard it: Aiya lei! Raise your bayonets high, killing the White bandits,
    Watermelons rolling all over the ground! Spring bamboo shoots grow in the mountain fields, the Party's words are set to music, singing everywhere in the fields—like the spring breeze, the people heard it: Aiya lei! Men become Red Army soldiers, women support the front,
    With songs in their hearts! The moon sets, the wind rises, and the fog fills the sky. The White bandits captured the propagandist. She stood tall on the execution ground—like Jinggang Mountain, singing: Aiya lei! Scolding the White bandits, their dog faces turned snow white,
    Their heads were like a mountain collapsing! The clouds clear, the mist scatters, and rainbows appear. The Red Army rescued her from the prison cage. The mountain songs are sung louder and louder—like birds soaring into the sky, spreading their wings and flying high: Aiya lei! Following the Red Army, flying all over the place,
    Singing wherever it's red! The bamboo forests of Jinggang are evergreen, the Jinggang Mountain songs are sung in Beijing. The old singer sings the new era, people become younger, and the songs are renewed, every sentence is a Great Leap Forward: Aiya lei! Red ballads, spread all over the world, singing beyond our predecessors to enlighten those who come after!

　　井冈山颂歌
　　张永枚
　　雨雾中无声的雨，飘飘的雾，树像影子，遮着小路。安静的图画里，响起激昂的歌。叮当叮当——开山的斧。哗啦哗啦——倾倒的树。车笛似空山鸟鸣，脚步声像咚咚战鼓。啊！深山不见人，呐喊震山谷！老赤卫队员雨霏霏，雨中走着勘探队。仰望岩头不见岩，只见雾绕云飞。哗哗的水声，在谷中炸碎。断岩要勘测，怎登这“壁垒”？带路老爹走上前，笑一声，似空谷响雷：“别看断岩险，当年我登岩步如飞。红军响起一声号，我岩头举石砸白匪……江西歌，湖南调，一只笛子岩头吹。过路同志停步听，只说仙乐在飘飞！”老爹说着登上天，一转眼没入雨雾内。空中飘下一根绳，悠扬笛声云中吹……红色女歌手井冈山上竹林青，张大妈家住青竹林，别看她头发花白，——好比山顶的云，唱起歌来：哎呀唻！大小五井，五大哨口，
    一齐传回声！井冈山上杜鹃花，当年的宣传员就是她！山顶唱歌来助战，——好比军号震山崖，红军听了：哎呀唻！高举刺刀，杀得白匪，
    遍地滚西瓜！山间野地发春笋，党的话儿谱歌音，田头陌上四处唱，——好比春天的风，人民听了：哎呀唻！男当红军，女子支前，
    心里带着歌声！月落风起雾满天，白匪捉住了宣传员，刑场上面她高高站，——好比井冈山，唱起歌来：哎呀唻！骂得白匪，狗脸雪白，
    头上像坍了一座山！云开雾散出彩虹，红军救她出牢笼，山歌越唱越响亮，——好比鸟儿上天空，展翅高飞：哎呀唻！跟着红军，飞遍四方，
    唱到哪里哪里红！井冈竹林万年青，井冈山唱到北京城，老歌手唱的新时代，人变年青歌更新，句句大跃进：哎呀唻！红色歌谣，传遍天下，唱绝前人启后人！
