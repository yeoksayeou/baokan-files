Xinhua News Agency, Nanning, 19th – The Liuzhou Traditional Chinese Medicine Hospital in Guangxi has persisted in running the hospital diligently and frugally for four years as if it were a single day, and has achieved great results.

Since its establishment in June 1956, this traditional Chinese medicine hospital, in the spirit of running all undertakings diligently and frugally, has added forty-two beds by doing it themselves without increasing state funding. They have built a patient nutrition kitchen, staff canteen, laundry room, and bathhouse, each one. They also built a Chinese medicinal material processing plant. Therefore, although the hospital's business is expanding day by day, the public miscellaneous expenses for 1958 and 1959 have always remained at the level of 1957, without any increase. From January to the end of August this year, the hospital's office expenses have been reduced by 39.6%, and the hospital's medicine and hospitalization costs have been reduced by 50% and 21% respectively, greatly reducing the burden on patients.

The hospital's measures to increase production and practice economy are multifaceted, including going to the mountains to collect herbs and process them themselves; using waste and old materials to replace expensive ones with cheap ones; doing it themselves to save money; comprehensive utilization, turning dead objects into life; planned control, cherishing and using; saving every bit, reusing again and again, and so on. Liu Zhongyuan, the party branch secretary and director of the hospital, led cadres to collect herbs in the Damiao Mountains. As of August this year, a total of more than 6,700 kilograms of various medicinal materials have been collected. In order to reduce the cost of medicinal materials, the hospital processes all the medicinal materials it collects itself and buys from the market, and makes its own pills, plasters, and medicinal wines. From January last year to September 5 this year, more than 17,000 kilograms of medicinal materials have been processed by themselves, and more than 60 kinds of pills have been made. The processing fee alone has saved the state more than 5,000 yuan. Chinese medicine requires a large amount of wrapping paper. The hospital's staff uses expired medical records and purchases old newspapers, which are disinfected and used as medicine wrapping paper, and rarely buys wrapping paper from the market. From January to August this year, packaging costs were saved by 72%. When the hospital's water and electrical equipment, instruments, furniture, etc. have problems, the medical staff repair them themselves; many of the hospital's work clothes, pillows, mosquito nets, masks, bed sheets, etc. are sewn and repaired by the staff themselves in their spare time.

The hospital's staff not only pays attention to diligence and frugality in large projects, but also never wastes every stitch and thread. They take great care of public property, purchase all kinds of items according to plan, and always return the old ones before receiving new ones. Cotton balls, gauze, etc. are disinfected and reused three times or more. In order to save transportation costs, the purchased medicinal materials are transported by the staff themselves to the station, wharf, and warehouse. From the establishment of the hospital to June this year, they have not printed an envelope for four whole years, and the envelopes they use are all made of old newspapers and reused old envelopes.

The Liuzhou Traditional Chinese Medicine Hospital can persist in running the hospital diligently and frugally, mainly because all the staff of the hospital, under the leadership of the party branch, have established a revolutionary ambition to work hard and strive for the top. In recent years, the hospital has always regarded diligence and thrift as an important part of the staff's evaluation, erected red flags, and continuously leaped forward. It has also played a great role in promoting the hospital's implementation of the spirit of diligence and frugality in running the hospital.

    自己动手　节省费用　一针一线  从不浪费
    柳州市中医院坚持勤俭办院
    新华社南宁19日电　广西柳州市中医院坚持勤俭办院四年如一日，取得了很大成绩。
    这所中医院从1956年6月建院以来，本着勤俭办一切事业的精神，在不增加国家经费的情况下，用自己动手的办法增加了四十二张病床，建成了病人营养厨房、职工食堂、洗衣房、洗澡房等各一间，还建成一座中药材加工场。因此，全院的业务虽然日益扩大，但1958年和1959年两年的公杂费开支，始终保持在1957年的水平，没有增加；今年1月至8月底止，全院办公费用又节约了39.6％，而且院里的药品和住院费用却分别降低了50％和21％，大大减轻了病人的负担。
    这个医院的增产节约措施是多方面的，其中包括上山采药，自己加工；利用废旧，以贱代贵；自己动手，节省费用；综合利用，死物回生；计划控制，爱护使用；点滴节约，一用再用等等。这个院的党支部书记、院长刘忠元带干部在大苗山采药后，到今年8月，共已采集各种药材六千七百多斤。为了降低药材成本，这个医院把自采的和从市上买来的药材一律自行加工，并自制药丸、药膏、药酒。从去年1月到今年9月5日，自己加工的药材就有一万七千多斤，自制药丸六十多种。仅加工费就为国家节约了五千多元。中药需要大量的包装纸，这个医院的职工就利用过期的病历和收购旧报纸，经过消毒处理后作包药纸，很少到市上买包装纸。从今年1月至8月，节约了包装费用72％。医院的水电设备、仪器、家具等有了毛病，医务人员就自己动手修理；全院的工作服、枕头、蚊帐、口罩、被单等，有很多都是职工利用一部分业余时间自己缝制和修补的。
    这个医院的职工不仅在大宗的项目上注意勤俭，就是一针一线，也从不浪费。他们对公共财产爱护备至，各种物品都按计划采购，领用新的总是先交回旧的，棉球、纱布等都经过消毒，有的复用三次以上。为了节约搬运费，购入的各种药材，由职工自己到车站、码头、仓库去搬运。从建院到今年6月，整整四年中他们没有印过一个信封，所用的信封都是职工用旧报纸制作和翻用旧信封。
    柳州市中医院能坚持勤俭办院，主要是由于全院职工在党支部领导下，人人树立了艰苦奋斗，力争上游的革命志气。几年来，院方一直把勤俭节约作为职工评比的一个重要内容，大树红旗，不断跃进。对推动全院贯彻勤俭办院精神也起了很大作用。
