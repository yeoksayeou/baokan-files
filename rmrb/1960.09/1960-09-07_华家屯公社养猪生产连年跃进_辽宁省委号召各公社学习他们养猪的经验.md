Huajiatun Commune's Hog Production Leaps Forward Year After Year
Liaoning Provincial Party Committee Calls on All Communes to Learn from Their Hog Raising Experience

(Our Dispatch from Shenyang, September 6) The red banner unit in Liaoning Province's animal husbandry, the Huajiatun Commune in Jin County, has seen its hog production leap forward year after year, and has explored a complete set of advanced experiences in leading hog production. Recently, the Liaoning Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party made a decision calling on all communes in the province to learn from them, vigorously develop the hog raising industry, and strive to overfulfill this year's animal husbandry production plan.

Huajiatun Commune is located in a hilly area, where the soil used to be barren and yields were very low. In the winter of 1955, the local masses established the Victory Advanced Agricultural Producers Cooperative, and at the same time vigorously developed the hog raising industry. By 1957, the commune raised 8,490 hogs, averaging 2.3 hogs per household. After the establishment of the people's commune, collective hog raising developed even faster. By October 1959, the number of hogs in stock increased to 21,000, making it the first commune in Liaoning Province to achieve one hog per person. Because of the large number of hogs raised, a lot of manure was accumulated, and more fertilizer was applied to farmland, resulting in a great increase in yields. The masses have truly realized from practice the truth that "hogs are a treasure to the farmer, and manure is gold in the field." The great development of the hog raising industry has also played a significant role in strengthening the commune's economy, increasing the income of commune members, and supporting the supply of meat to cities. From 1956 to 1959, the commune sold a total of 9,408 fattened hogs to the state, and supported various regions with 47,000 piglets and breeding hogs. In these four years, the commune's income from selling hogs alone reached 960,000 yuan, averaging 260 yuan per household. In 1959, hog raising income accounted for 30% of the total agricultural and animal husbandry income.

The primary reason why the hog raising industry in Huajiatun Commune has developed so rapidly is the Party committee's emphasis, the leaders' determination, and the thorough and deep ideological work. As early as the initial stage of cooperativization, the local Party organization had a clear understanding of the mutually promoting relationship between hog raising and manure accumulation, and relying on fertilizer to increase grain production, and chose this path of combining agriculture and animal husbandry. After communization, the conditions for great development became even more available, and the commune's leadership over hog raising was further strengthened. It quickly established a professional front for animal husbandry, and from the commune to the production team, designated full-time secretaries and team leaders to be responsible, and repeatedly rectified the feeding teams. In its leadership work, the commune Party committee discussed animal husbandry production issues once a month, closely grasped political and ideological education, and insisted on implementing the Party's policies. For example, at the beginning of last year, some commune members disagreed with the practice of "keeping all sows and selecting later," and advocated selling more piglets for immediate profit. After the Party committee mobilized all commune members to speak out and debate, it became clear the benefits of expanding the source of hogs to ensure a large development of hogs. Because the understanding was unified, the number of hogs raised in the autumn doubled. With more hogs raised, some cadres were worried, thinking that "big development is risky, small development is stable," and tried to maintain the status quo. Therefore, they had fears about building hog farms and feed supply. The commune Party committee, on the one hand, adopted the method of "debating if there is no understanding, and looking if there is no belief" to correct the thinking of these people; on the other hand, it relied on commune members to adhere to the principle of obtaining materials locally and running the farms diligently and frugally, and gradually solved the practical difficulties in the great development. The entire commune worked together to ensure the great development of the hog raising industry.

The continuous leaps forward in hog raising in Huajiatun Commune are also due to the series of effective measures they have taken to overcome the six obstacles of hog sources, hog pens, feed, hygiene and epidemic prevention, tool reform, and feeding management. They have accumulated a lot of experience in these areas. The most important issue in raising a large number of hogs is to raise feed. In addition to a small amount of concentrated feed, they mainly feed green and coarse feed. These include green feed, silage feed, succulent feed, and dry-stored agricultural by-products, totaling 117 kinds. Their experience in grasping feed is: "Planting in spring, collecting in summer, storing in autumn, processing in winter, and grazing year-round without letting up." In the spring, in addition to intercropping high-yield crops on fixed feed bases, they also make full use of the edges of fields and ditches to grow melons and vegetables. In addition, the interrows of fruit trees, the stubble after early-maturing crops, and the preceding crops of late-autumn crops are also objects they use for planting feed. In the summer, during the season when aquatic plants are lush, they collect a large number of wild plants and engage in large-scale silage production. In the autumn, they seize the opportunity of threshing to collect all the by-products that hogs can eat, such as straw, vegetable seedlings, and bran. In addition, they also adhere to the year-round grazing method of "grazing on sunny slopes in spring, cool riverbeds in summer, stubble fields in autumn, and large herds in winter." Because these measures are grasped tightly, even though the number of hogs continues to increase, there is still a surplus of feed every year.

The in-depth and down-to-earth leadership of cadres is also an important condition for ensuring the rapid development of the hog raising industry. They prominently grasped the methods of evaluation and competition, praising advanced individuals, and inserting red flags on a large scale. Here, there is constant competition between teams, farms, and individuals, and the commune and brigade regularly conduct evaluations and rewards. In the past half year, the entire commune has rewarded 175 model feeders and three pacesetters on the hog raising front. The cadres here, including the first secretary of the commune Party committee, often go deep into the pig farms, eat and live with the feeders, participate in production, and lead production. The main cadres of the commune and brigade each have their own hog raising experimental fields. Last year, the entire commune summarized and promoted more than a dozen advanced experiences from the experimental fields. In addition, they also organized cadres and feeders to visit Chongqing, Changsha, Tianjin, Xinjin, and brother communes in the county to learn from the masters and learn experiences in feeding management and technological innovation, and promoted them throughout the commune after learning them.

This spring, when the province held a conference of agricultural heroes, many places proposed to "learn from Huajia and catch up with Huajia," which further encouraged their enthusiasm. The entire commune further carried out a large-scale tool reform movement. Most of the fifty-three pig farms have realized feed pulverization, feed delivery carts, self-flowing water diversion, and feed cooking. Key farms have also formed a complete chain of technological reforms from feed pulverization to feed delivery. As a result, labor was greatly saved. Although the number of hogs raised in the entire commune continued to increase, the number of feeders was reduced by 150. Now, the number of feeders only accounts for 5% of the total labor force, of which one-third are women. As a result of these continuous efforts, the current number of hogs in stock has increased by 23% compared with the end of last year, and the number of hogs raised has increased by 62%.

    华家屯公社养猪生产连年跃进
    辽宁省委号召各公社学习他们养猪的经验
    本报沈阳6日电　辽宁省畜牧业红旗单位——金县华家屯公社，养猪生产连年跃进，并且在领导养猪生产方面摸索出一整套先进经验。最近，中共辽宁省委做出决定，号召全省公社向他们学习，大力发展养猪事业，力争超额完成今年畜牧业生产计划。
    华家屯公社处在丘陵地区，过去土质瘠薄产量很低。1955年冬，当地群众成立了胜利高级农业生产合作社，同时大力发展养猪业，到1957年全社养猪达八千四百九十头，平均每户二点三头。人民公社化以后，集体养猪发展得更快，到1959年10月猪的存栏数增加到二万一千头，成为辽宁省第一个实现一人一头猪的公社。由于养猪多，积肥多，农田施肥也多，产量大大增加。这里主要作物之一——花生，过去每亩施肥三千斤，平均只产一百六十二斤；去年施肥增加到八千斤，秋后亩产量猛增到三百六十五斤。群众从实践中切实体会到“猪是农家宝、粪是地里金”的真理。养猪业大发展，对于壮大公社经济、增加社员收入、支援城市肉食也起了很大的作用。全社从1956年到1959年，共卖给国家肥猪九千四百零八头，支援各地仔猪、种猪四万七千头。这四年内，全公社仅卖猪收入就达九十六万元，平均每户可得二百六十元。1959年养猪收入占农牧业总收入的30％。
    华家屯公社养猪事业发展得这样快，首要原因是党委重视，领导决心大，思想工作做得深，做得透。远在合作化初期，当地党组织对养猪积肥、靠肥打粮的互相促进关系认识就很明确，选择了这条农牧并举的道路。公社化以后，大发展的条件更加具备，公社对养猪的领导也进一步加强，很快就建立起畜牧业专业战线，从公社到生产队，都指定专职的书记、队长负责，并几次整顿饲养队伍。在领导工作中，公社党委每月讨论一次畜牧业生产问题，紧紧抓住政治思想教育，坚持贯彻执行党的方针、政策。如去年初有些社员不同意“见母就留、先留后选”的做法，主张多卖仔猪现得利。经党委发动全体社员鸣放辩论，弄清了扩大猪源对保证猪只大发展的好处，由于统一了认识，秋后养猪头数增长了一倍。养的猪多了，又有少数干部忧虑重重，他们认为“大发展冒险，小发展稳当”，企图维持现状，因此在建猪场和饲料等问题上有畏难情绪。公社党委一方面采取“不通就辩、不信就看”的办法，端正这些人的思想；另方面依靠社员坚持就地取材、勤俭办场原则，逐个解决大发展中的实际困难，全社一致努力保证了养猪事业大发展。
    华家屯公社养猪不断跃进，也由于他们采取了一系列的有力措施，才度过了猪源、猪舍、饲料、卫生防疫、工具改革、饲养管理等六道关。在这些方面他们积累了许多经验。大量养猪最重要的问题是筹集饲料，他们除少量精饲料外，主要是喂青粗饲料。其中有青饲料、青贮饲料、多汁饲料、干藏的农副产品，共一百一十七种。他们抓饲料的经验是：“春种、夏采、秋藏、冬加工，常年放牧不放松”。春天，除了在固定的饲料基地上，实行高产作物套种以外，还利用地边、沟沿大种瓜菜。另外，果树行间、早熟作物下茬、晚秋作物上茬，也是他们利用种饲料的对象。在夏天水草繁茂季节，他们大量采集野生植物，大搞青贮。秋季抓住脱谷机会，把猪能吃的秸稞、秧菜、糠皮等副产物全收藏起来。此外，他们还坚持“春放阳坡地、夏放河沟凉、秋放茬子地、冬放大放帮”的常年放牧办法。由于这些措施抓得紧，尽管猪的头数不断增加，但饲料仍年年有余。
    干部领导深入踏实，也是保证养猪事业迅速发展的重要条件。他们突出地抓住了评比竞赛、表扬先进、大插红旗的办法。这里队与队、场与场、人与人常年都在竞赛，公社、大队定期进行评比奖励。近半年来，全公社就奖励了一百七十五名模范饲养员，三名养猪战线标兵。这里的干部，包括公社党委第一书记，经常深入猪场，和饲养员同吃同住，参加生产，领导生产。公社和大队的主要干部，每人都有自己的养猪试验田，全公社去年一年就从试验田中总结与推广了十几项先进经验。此外，他们还组织干部、饲养员到重庆、长沙、天津、新金和县内兄弟社拜师取经，学习饲养管理和技术革新等经验，学会了就在全公社推广。
    今年春天，省里开农业群英会，许多地方提出“学华家、赶华家”，更加鼓舞了他们的干劲。全公社进一步大搞工具改革运动，五十三个猪场大部实现了饲料粉碎化、送食车子化、引水自流化、饲料蒸煮化。重点场还形成了从饲料粉碎到送食的技术改革一条龙。因之，大大节省了劳动力，全公社养猪数虽然继续增多，饲养员却减少了一百五十名，现在饲养人员只占总劳动力的5％，其中三分之一是妇女。这样不断努力的结果，目前猪的存栏数较去年年末增长了23％，饲养数增长了62％。
