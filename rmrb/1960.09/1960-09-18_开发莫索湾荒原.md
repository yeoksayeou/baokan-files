    Developing the Mosowan Wasteland
    Red flags are planted all over Mosowan,
    The vast land is turned over with one hand.
    Awakening a thousand years of slumber,
    Forever preserving youth in the world.
    This is a song of praise written by the Commander of the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps to the heroic fighters who overcame the drought and wind and sand of the Junggar Basin and developed the Mosowan wasteland.
    Starting from the new city of Shihezi at the foot of the Tianshan Mountains, crossing the Manas River eastward, and entering the Junggar Basin northward, after passing through a continuous stretch of sand dunes, a boundless oasis suddenly unfolds before your eyes. This is Mosowan. One large truck after another on the highway is fully loaded with harvested wheat for transportation. Everywhere on the threshing grounds, wheat is piled up like small mountains. The threshing machines roared, and the men and women workers were in high spirits and sang enthusiastically. Seeing such a scene, it is hard to believe that this was a desolate wilderness only two years ago.
        Surveying Wasteland
    The story must start from the beginning.
    In November 1957, a pioneering team of seven people from the Shihezi Reclamation Area of ​​the Production and Construction Corps, braved the wind and sand to arrive at Mosowan. All they brought with them were a tent, two gasoline drums filled with water, and an iron pot for cooking. The leader of the pioneer team was Comrade Xiao Fengrui, the current political commissar of the Mosowan Management Office. This Eighth Route Army soldier, born into a poor peasant family, participated in the production of Nanniwan, defended Yan'an in the War of Liberation, participated in the battle to liberate the Northwest, and was wounded many times. When he led the pioneer team to Mosowan, it was covered with *Suosuo*, *Hongliu* (red willow), and other drought-resistant plants peculiar to the desert, all taller than a person. There were no roads, no people, and not a drop of water. Comrade Xiao Fengrui led six people to survey the wasteland and set up canal lines, eating frozen dry food as hard as iron when they were hungry. The two barrels of water they brought became the lifeline for the seven people's work and life at that time, with each person only receiving a small teacup of water per day. Sometimes, they lost contact while searching for wasteland during the day, and at night they lit bonfires to gather the lost people together. In this way, day after day, they persisted in a life of isolation from the world for more than twenty days, and identified millions of *mu* of wasteland that could be reclaimed.
          Finding Water Sources
    Mosowan is extremely arid. A hundred years ago, the Qing government attempted to use the army governing the people of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang to cultivate here, but the drought forced the entire army to retreat. Even when the People's Liberation Army entered Mosowan on a large scale, the remains of old walls and corpses of people that had not rotted for a long time due to drought were still found. After the People's Liberation Army entered this wasteland, they waged a heroic and unyielding struggle against the water shortage. Without water to drink, the soldiers dug underground bitter water to quench their thirst. Without cement to build water control structures, they used wild *Suosuo* and *Hongliu* instead. The soldiers' slogan was: Heroes muster up soaring enthusiasm, struggle hard for a year and the granaries will be full, and write poems under the apple trees. In half a year, they overcame obstacles, endured hunger and thirst, and built a huge irrigation system including four large main canals in the wasteland, bringing the rushing Manas River water to the wasteland. Six modern mechanized farms were built, and 380,000 *mu* of wasteland were reclaimed in the same year, with a planting area of ​​190,000 *mu*, including 110,000 *mu* of winter wheat. A bumper harvest was achieved in the first year, not only providing self-sufficiency, but also delivering more than 22 million *jin* of wheat to the state. Now, Mosowan has reclaimed 840,000 *mu* of wasteland, and this year has planted more than 700,000 *mu* of wheat, cotton, corn and other crops, as well as more than 60,000 *mu* of protective forest belts and orchards. These lands have been uniformly planned, not only are the land as flat as a mirror, the fields are in rows, the canals are networked, and the forest belts are crisscrossed, but also the roads are accessible in all directions. The heroic oath of "struggle hard for a year and the granaries will be full, and write poems under the apple trees" originally proposed by the soldiers has all become a vivid reality. Today, the formerly arid grassland has not only become a garden-like oasis, but also a new village with service industries such as machinery repair factories, agricultural product processing factories, schools, hospitals, post and telecommunications bureaus, banks, and department stores.
        Resisting Wind and Sand
    Conquering drought is only one aspect of the soldiers' conquest of nature. The soldiers often say that wind and sand are Mosowan's "special product". We encountered a Force 7 wind only a few days after arriving in Mosowan. When the strong wind rose, the sand and dust in the air above the Gurbantunggut Desert in the northwest corner, like smoke, instantly engulfed half the sky. The strong wind夹着 (mixed with) yellow sand made it impossible to open one's eyes and difficult to stand still.
    Here, the greatest harm to wheat is nothing more than this. In June last year, during the wheat filling period, several strong winds in the Mosowan area blew down one-third of the first-class seedlings, and the more serious ones blew down more than 60%. In those days, the soldiers stayed in the wheat fields day and night, using temporary methods such as tying to prevent lodging. However, one laborer was managing more than 100 *mu* of wheat, and even if tying was a good method, how could large areas of wheat fields be saved!
    With this lesson, the soldiers were not discouraged. On the contrary, they studied the growth patterns of wheat and looked for the possibility of resistance to lodging. Later, they finally discovered that the soil in Mosowan originally contained more nitrogen fertilizer, and the jointing water was watered too early and too much, causing the wheat seedlings to grow too vigorously, and the first and second nodes in the lower part of the stem elongated and became fragile, unable to withstand the onslaught of strong winds. Based on these reasons, this year, the employees of various farms in Mosowan adopted the method of strengthening winter irrigation, harrowing snow to conserve moisture, and changing "early first watering" to "late first watering" in the early stage of wheat growth to control the rampant growth of wheat and make the wheat seedlings have deep roots and strong stalks. When applying topdressing fertilizer at the returning green stage, they applied 200 *jin* of plant ash and 5 *jin* of superphosphate per *mu* of first-class seedlings to increase the ability to resist lodging and resist wind and sand. When the wheat reached the earing and filling stage, which is most prone to lodging, the party branches of each production team sent party members with watering experience to water the wheat. Upon receiving a strong wind forecast, watering was stopped immediately; after the strong wind, they seized the gap of good weather and rushed to water day and night. This year, on June 3, when the wheat began to ear, a Force 9 wind blew, but after the strong wind, all the wheat stood as before. This year, the area of wheat managed by each person reached more than 200 *mu*, which is double that of last year, but no lodging occurred, and the average yield per *mu* greatly exceeded that of last year. Calculated based on the area managed, each laborer produces an average of more than 60,000 *jin* of wheat per year.
    The soldiers who developed Mosowan were not satisfied with the existing achievements. When we were about to leave Mosowan, they were speeding up the reclamation and leveling of wasteland to prepare conditions for expanding the winter wheat planting area this year. At the same time, they also sent a camel team deep into the Junggar Basin and the Gurbantunggut Desert to survey the wasteland. This camel team recently brought back exciting news: they found another 700,000 *mu* of wasteland in the desert as flat and fertile as Mosowan. Correspondent of this newspaper

### 开发莫索湾荒原

    开发莫索湾荒原
    红旗遍插莫索湾，
    茫茫大地一手翻。
    唤起千年沉睡梦，
    永保青春在人间。
    这是新疆生产建设兵团司令员给战胜了准噶尔盆地干旱和风沙，开发莫索湾荒原的英雄战士们写的一首赞歌。
    从天山脚下的石河子新城出发，东跨玛纳斯河，北入准噶尔盆地，穿过一段连绵不绝的沙丘，忽然，眼前展开一片望不到边的绿洲，这就是莫索湾。公路上一辆接一辆的大卡车，满载着丰收的小麦向外运送。到处的麦场上小麦堆得像小山一样。脱粒机发出隆隆的吼声，男女职工兴高彩烈，歌声昂扬。看到这样的情景，简直令人难以相信这里两年前还是一个渺无人烟的荒原。
        查荒地
    故事还得从头讲起。
    1957年11月，生产兵团石河子垦区一支由七人组成的开荒先遣队，冒着风沙来到了莫索湾，他们随身所带的只是一顶帐篷、两个装着水的汽油桶和一口作饭的铁锅。率领先遣队的就是现在莫索湾管理处政委萧凤瑞同志。这位贫农出身的八路军战士，参加过南泥湾生产，解放战争中保卫过延安，参加过解放大西北的战斗，负过多次伤。他率领的先遣队到莫索湾的时候，这里遍地是一人多高的索索、红柳和一些沙漠特有的其他耐旱植物，没有道路，没有人烟，没有一滴水。萧凤瑞同志领着六个人勘查荒地，设置渠线，饿了就吃随身带来的冻得像铁块一样的干粮。他们带来的两桶水，成了当时七个人工作和生活的生命线，每人每天只能分到一小茶缸水。有时，白天四出寻找荒地失掉了联系，晚上就升起篝火，把迷路的人召集到一起。就这样，一天又一天，他们坚持了二十多天与世隔绝的生活，查明了成百万亩可开的荒地。
          找水源
    莫索湾是异常干旱的。一百年前，清政府曾经企图用统治新疆各族人民的军队屯垦这里，但是干旱迫使全军撤退。直到人民战士大规模进入莫索湾时，还发现昔日的断垣残壁和因为干旱久不腐烂的人的尸体。人民战士进入这片荒原以后，曾经和缺水现象进行了英勇不屈的斗争。没有水喝，战士们就挖地下苦水解渴。没有修控制水量建筑物的水泥，就用野生索索、红柳代替。战士们的口号是：英雄鼓足冲天干劲，苦战一年粮满仓，苹果树下写诗歌。半年时间，他们以披荆斩棘，忍饥忍渴，在荒原上修起包括有四条大干渠的巨大灌溉系统，把急湍奔流的玛纳斯流水引到了荒地。建起了六个现代化机械化农场，当年就开垦了三十八万亩荒地，播种面积达十九万亩，其中有十一万亩冬麦，第一年就获得丰收，不仅自给有余，而且还给国家上交小麦二千二百多万斤。现在，莫索湾已经开荒八十四万亩，今年播种小麦、棉花、玉米等作物七十多万亩，防护林带和果园六万多亩。这些土地都经过统一规划，不但地平如镜，田畦成排，渠道成网，林带纵横交错，而且公路四通八达。战士们当初提出的“苦战一年粮满仓，苹果树下写诗歌”的英雄誓言，全成为活生生的现实了。如今，昔日干旱的草原不仅成为园田化的绿洲，而且成为一个拥有机械修配厂、农产品加工厂、学校、医院、邮电局、银行、百货商店等服务行业的新农村。
        抗风沙
    制服干旱只是战士们征服大自然的一方面，战士们常说，风沙是莫索湾的“特产”。我们到莫索湾不过几天，就遇到了一次七级风。大风起时，西北角古尔班通古特大沙漠上空像烟雾一样的沙尘，刹时间就吞没半边天，夹着黄沙的劲风，使人眼睁不开，站立不稳。
    在这里，对小麦危害最大的莫过于此了。去年6月间，正是小麦灌浆期，莫索湾地区几场大风，刮倒了三分之一的一类苗，较严重的竟刮倒了60％以上。在那些日子里，战士们昼夜不离麦田，用扎把等临时的方法来防止倒伏。但是，一个劳力管着一百多亩小麦，即使扎把是一种好的方法，怎么能挽救大面积的麦田！
    有了这个教训，战士们并不灰心。相反地，他们研究了小麦的生长规律，寻找抗倒伏的可能性。后来，他们终于发现莫索湾土地原来含氮肥较多，加上拔节水浇得过早过多，造成麦苗生长过旺，株茎下部的第一、二茎节伸长而且变得脆弱，禁不起狂风袭击。根据这些原因，今年莫索湾各农场职工在小麦生长前期，采取加强冬灌，耙雪保墒，改“头水早”为“头水迟”的办法，控制小麦疯长，使小麦苗期根深秆壮。在返青追肥时，他们对一类苗每亩追施二百斤草木灰和五斤过磷酸钙，增加抗倒伏能力，抵抗风沙。当小麦到了孕穗灌浆最容易倒伏的时刻，各个生产队党支部都把有浇水经验的党员派去浇水。接到大风预报，浇水即时停止；大风过后，又抓紧好天气的空隙，昼夜突击浇水。今年6月3日，小麦开始孕穗，刮了一次九级风，但是大风过后，所有的小麦都屹立如故。今年他们每人管理小麦的面积达到二百多亩，比去年大一倍，但没有发生倒伏，平均单产大大超过去年。按管理的面积计算，平均每个劳动力一年就生产六万多斤小麦。
    开发莫索湾的战士们并没有满足于现有的成就，当我们快要离开莫索湾时，他们又在加紧开荒、平整荒地，给今年扩大冬麦播种面积准备条件。同时，还派出了一支深入准噶尔盆地大沙漠勘测荒地的骆驼队。这支骆驼队最近又带回来了一个令人兴奋的消息：他们在沙漠里又找到一块像莫索湾一样平坦、肥沃的七十万亩荒地。本报记者
