Shandong Carries Out Drought Resistance and Prevention Campaign
　　Shandong is carrying out an in-depth drought resistance and prevention struggle, striving to increase production in the late autumn and sowing wheat in a timely manner.
　　Since late August, most areas of Shandong have not had a thorough rain. Some areas in the prefectures of Liaocheng, Heze, Jining, Zibo, and the counties under the jurisdiction of Jinan City have experienced varying degrees of drought. At present, the drought is still developing in these areas. Counties and communes in Liaocheng, Jinan, Heze and other severely affected areas have mobilized superior forces and invested them in the fight against drought.寿张,肥城,泰安,茌平等县 (Shou Zhang, Feicheng, Tai'an, Chiping and other counties) have adopted the method of returning the five waters of wells, rivers, reservoirs, ponds, and pits to the fields, and using various water conservancy tools together to irrigate late autumn crops and early wheat fields. In areas where drought has not occurred, they are generally plowing to conserve moisture, heavily watering late autumn crops to increase production, and heavily irrigating wheat before sowing to carry out drought prevention and production increase campaigns.
　　
Jilin Achieves Great Results in Autumn Manure Accumulation
　　While focusing on late-stage field management, Jilin Province has launched a manure accumulation and fertilizer production campaign, including沤绿肥 (沤绿肥:沤 is a way to ferment and decompose materials), and digging peat. By the end of August, the province had completed 70% of its autumn manure accumulation task, ensuring quality.
　　In order to save transportation resources for manure accumulation and delivery, some areas have adopted methods such as moving cattle pens to the mountains, pig pens to the fields, wild manure not entering homes, and household manure being sent to the fields to carry out field manure fermentation and fertilizer production. According to statistics from the Siping area, more than 3,800 livestock pens have been moved to the mountains and fields, and more than 21,000 field manure fermentation pits have been established.

Guangdong Top-Dresses Late Rice and Prepares Fertilizer for Winter Planting
　　People's communes in Guangdong Province are seizing the current favorable opportunity to add and accumulate fertilizer for late rice and prepare base fertilizer for winter planting.
　　In the manure accumulation campaign, various localities have broadened the sources of fertilizer according to local conditions. The Shantou area has a long coastline, and it is currently the season for abundant production of sea peanuts, sea crabs, 海茜 (a marine plant), sea moss, 沙米螺 (a type of shellfish), etc. Communes along the coast are organizing forces to vigorously collect them. Thirteen communes in Chaoyang County, including棉城,金浦,海门,和平,仙庵 (Miancheng, Jinpu, Haimen, Heping, Xian'an), have established professional teams to salvage sea fertilizer, going out to sea every day to accumulate large amounts of sea fertilizer.

Strive for Early Maturity and High Yields of Cotton
　　Cotton-producing areas in Gansu Province, such as the Hexi Corridor and along the Yellow River, are focusing on measures such as pruning, topping, preventing and controlling diseases and pests, irrigating and fertilizing, and weeding to strengthen late-stage cotton field management. This aims to protect buds, promote autumn bolls, increase boll weight, and promote early maturity and high yields of cotton.敦煌,酒泉,安西,民勤 (Dunhuang, Jiuquan, Anxi, and Minqin) and other counties and cities in the Hexi Corridor are fertilizing and weeding according to the growth and development patterns of cotton. Currently, 488,800 mu have been weeded, 430,000 mu have been irrigated with autumn water, and 260,000 mu have been top-dressed with fertilizer to promote bud and boll protection.
　　In the current late-stage cotton management, various parts of Sichuan Province have universally launched a "double catch" assault campaign of catching up late-sown cotton with early-sown cotton, and catching up weak seedling cotton with strong seedling cotton, striving for comprehensive and balanced increase in cotton production. At present, many areas have launched management appraisal competitions, heavily top-dressing late-sown and weak seedling cotton with seedling-promoting fertilizer, and adopting the method of hole application to ensure that the nutrients of the fertilizer can be fully absorbed by the seedling roots. Jianyang County, a major cotton-producing area, uses past experience in high-yield cotton production to manage late-sown and weak seedling cotton differently according to local conditions.

Add Measures to Manage Autumn Vegetables Well
　　Sichuan Province strengthens vegetable field management according to the growth law of vegetables to promote early maturity and high yield. In management work, various localities have taken corresponding measures based on the high-yield law of vegetables. For example, when applying fertilizer, apply it in the early morning or evening on sunny days, and apply it to the roots of crops, which can not only exert the effect of fertilizer, but also play a role in drought prevention and resistance; apply more refined fertilizer to thin soil, and more light manure water to fertile soil; apply multiple times in small amounts to seedlings, and fewer times in larger amounts to vegetables in the middle and late stages.
　　In order to effectively manage autumn vegetable production, each level of Shandong Provincial Party Committee has a secretary in charge, and vegetable production offices have been established with the agricultural and financial and trade departments as the mainstay. In terms of preventing and controlling diseases and insect pests, various localities are preventing them in a timely manner in line with the spirit of focusing on prevention, early treatment, and thorough treatment, striving for high yield and high harvest of autumn vegetables.
　　Early-sown autumn vegetables in the Bengbu area of Anhui Province are lush green. Various localities have also strengthened the basic construction of vegetable bases, actively trained technical personnel, and improved field management level. Yangzhuang Commune in Su County has universally built manure fermentation ponds in the vegetable garden, fermenting and using them at the same time.

Prepare Early for Winter Life
　　Pingfangzi Commune in the喀喇沁左翼蒙古族自治县 (喀喇沁左翼蒙古族自治县: a district in China) is actively preparing for the winter in the canteen while vigorously strengthening late-stage field management.
　　As early as the beginning of August, the Party Committee of Pingfangzi Commune studied and deployed issues related to heating, grain and vegetable storage, and canteen housing for this winter. Regarding the heating of public canteens this winter, in accordance with the habits of the masses and the principle of thrift, labor-saving and practical equipment such as fire walls and heated brick beds are mainly used. For heating in commune members' homes, the brigade or team supplies brick blanks to build heated brick beds.
　　By the end of August, the eighteen brigades of the entire commune had renovated 700 canteen houses, more than 100 of which had been built with heated brick beds, and also repaired more than 600 granaries, prepared more than 4,000 large pickling vats, and repaired more than 500 heated brick beds for commune members' families.

    要闻快报
    山东开展抗旱防旱斗争
    山东各地深入开展抗旱防旱斗争，力争晚秋增产，适时种麦。
    山东从8月下旬以来，大部地区未落透雨。聊城、菏泽、济宁、淄博专区和济南市所属各县有一部分地区发生不同程度的旱象。目前，这些地区的旱象还在发展。聊城、济南、菏泽等地区受旱严重的县、社，都纷纷调集优势力量，投入抗旱斗争。寿张、肥城、泰安、茌平等县都采用井、河、库、塘、坑五水归田，和各种水利工具一齐上阵的方法，浇晚秋作物，灌早茬麦田。在没有发生旱情的地区，普遍锄地保墒，大浇晚秋增产水和大灌小麦播前水，开展防旱增产运动。
    吉林秋季积肥成绩大
    吉林省各地在狠抓后期田间管理的同时，开展了沤绿肥、挖草炭等积肥造肥运动。到8月底止，全省秋季积肥任务已完成了70％，并且保证了质量。
    为了节省积肥、送肥的运输力，部分地区采取了牛圈上山、猪圈下田、野粪不进家、家粪送下田等办法，进行田头沤肥，地里造肥。据四平地区统计，已有三千八百多个畜圈上山下田，建立田间沤肥坑二万一千多个。
    广东为晚稻追肥为冬种备肥
    广东省各地人民公社抓紧当前有利时机，为晚稻添积追肥和为冬种准备底肥。
    在积肥运动中，各地都因地制宜广辟肥源。汕头专区海岸线很长，目前正是海花生、海蟹、海茜、海青苔、沙米螺等盛产的季节，沿海各公社正组织力量大力采集。潮阳县的棉城、金浦、海门、和平、仙庵等十三个公社，都建立了打捞海肥的专业队，连日出海大积海肥。
    力争棉花早熟多收
    甘肃省的河西走廊和黄河沿岸等地的产棉区，大抓整枝打顶、防治病虫害、灌水追肥和锄草等措施，加强棉田后期管理，以保伏桃、促秋桃、增铃重，力促棉花早熟多收。河西走廊的敦煌、酒泉、安西、民勤等县市，根据棉花生长发育规律，正在追肥和除草。现在已有四十八万八千八百亩锄过草，四十三万亩灌过秋水，二十六万亩追施了增蕾保桃肥。
    四川省各地在当前棉花后期管理中，普遍掀起迟播棉赶早播棉、弱苗棉赶壮苗棉的“双赶”突击运动，力争棉花全面平衡增产。目前，许多地区开展了管理评比竞赛，给迟播棉、弱苗棉大力追施提苗肥，并采取打窝穴施肥的办法，使肥料的养分能被苗根全部吸收。盛产棉花的简阳县，运用过去棉花丰产的经验，因地制宜地对迟播棉、弱苗棉进行了不同的管理。
    添加措施管好秋菜
    四川各地根据蔬菜生长规律，加强菜田管理，促使早熟多收。在管理工作中，各地根据蔬菜的高产规律采取了相应的措施。譬如追肥，烈日天就在清晨或黄昏追施，施在作物根部，这样既能发挥肥效，又能起到防旱抗旱作用；瘦薄土多施精肥，肥沃土多施淡粪水；对幼苗就采取多次少施，处于中期和后期的蔬菜则少次多施。
    山东各级党委为切实搞好秋菜生产，各有一名书记挂帅，以农业和财贸部门为主建立了蔬菜生产办公室。在防治病虫害方面，各地本着以防为主、治早、治了的精神及时防治，力争秋菜高产多收。
    安徽省蚌埠专区早播的秋菜一片嫩绿。各地还加强了蔬菜基地的基本建设工作，积极训练技术力量，提高田间管理水平。宿县杨庄公社在菜园地头普遍兴建沤肥池，边沤边用。
    为冬季生活早作准备
    辽宁喀喇沁左翼蒙古族自治县平房子公社，在大力加强后期田间管理的同时，积极进行食堂过冬准备工作。
    平房子公社党委早在8月初就对今冬有关取暖、粮菜保管、食堂用房等问题进行了研究和布置。关于今冬公共食堂的取暖，根据群众习惯和勤俭办事的原则，主要采用火墙、火炕等省工实用的设备。社员家庭取暖，由大队或小队供给砖坯，搭修炕炉。
    到8月末，全公社十八个大队已整修好食堂房子七百间，有一百多间已经搭上火炕，还修缮粮库六百多间，准备腌菜大缸四千多个，为社员家庭修好炕炉五百多个。
