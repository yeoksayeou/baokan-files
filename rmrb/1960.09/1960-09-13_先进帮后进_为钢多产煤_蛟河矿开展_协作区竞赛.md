Xinhua News Agency, Changchun, September 12th: In the campaign to increase production and practice economy, the Jiaohe Coal Mine in Jilin Province has extensively launched an "Collaboration Zone Competition" in which advanced workers help backward workers, enabling the production of all mine shafts to reach advanced levels. Since the launch of the Collaboration Zone Competition in late August, the average daily coal production of the entire mine has increased by 14.1% compared to the first and middle ten days of the month, and the raw coal output has reached the highest level since the mine was built. From September 1st to 5th, it overfulfilled the raw coal production plan by 2,286 tons.

The Jiaohe Coal Mine's "Collaboration Zone Competition" is a development based on the Red Flag Competition of the previous seven months. In late August, the mine's Party committee held a meeting of leading cadres, analyzed the overall competition situation, and concluded that the weak links were the No. 6 Mine and the Wulin Vertical Shaft. Therefore, the mine's Party committee adopted the method of advanced helping backward for common improvement, mobilizing the workers of advanced mine shafts to help these two mine shafts improve production. Now, two competition collaboration zones have been formed throughout the mine: No. 4 Mine and No. 7 Mine help the Wulin Vertical Shaft, forming the first collaboration zone; No. 3 Mine and No. 5 Mine help No. 6 Mine, forming the second collaboration zone.

After the "Collaboration Zone Competition" was launched, the mine's Party committee strengthened its leadership, established a "Collaboration Zone Competition" committee, organized mutual support in manpower and materials among the various units, and also shared information, exchanged experiences, and promptly evaluated and inspected the competition results of the two major collaboration zones. On the other hand, the main responsible cadres of the Party committee went deep into the mine entrances to help solve problems in the competition.

Under the leadership of the mine's Party committee, a communist large-scale collaboration competition emphasizing the collective and helping others has been widely launched. No. 7 Mine found that the transportation of the Wulin Vertical Shaft could not keep up with the production needs, so it sent the transportation section chief, team leaders, etc., to help organize the roadways and repair transportation equipment; the mine's inspection and transportation section also sent eight roadway repair workers to help replace 70 meters of railway line, which solved the transportation problem of the Wulin Vertical Shaft. The Party branch secretaries of No. 4 Mine and No. 7 Mine also stayed at the Wulin Vertical Shaft from August 20th to 31st to help improve the management system. No. 5 Mine, knowing that No. 6 Mine's production had not caught up, also proactively sent two excellent coal mining teams to support it. With the help of advanced mine shafts, the Wulin Vertical Shaft overproduced more than 700 tons of coal in August, and the average daily output in late August increased by 9.1% compared to the first and middle ten days of the month. The average daily output of No. 6 Mine in late August increased by 4.1% compared to the first ten days of the month.

### 先进帮后进　为钢多产煤  蛟河矿开展“协作区竞赛”

    先进帮后进　为钢多产煤
    蛟河矿开展“协作区竞赛”
    据新华社长春12日电　吉林省蛟河煤矿在增产节约运动中，广泛开展先进帮后进的“协作区竞赛”，使全矿各矿井的生产都达到先进水平。8月下旬开展协作区竞赛以后，全矿的平均日产煤量比上、中旬提高14.1％，原煤产量达到建矿以来的最高水平。9月1日到5日，又超额二千二百八十六吨完成了原煤产量计划。
    蛟河煤矿的“协作区竞赛”，是在前七个多月的红旗竞赛的基础上发展起来的。8月下旬，矿党委召开领导干部会议，分析了全矿竞赛情况，认为薄弱环节是六井和乌林立井，于是矿党委采取先进带后进共同提高的办法，发动先进矿井的职工帮助这两个矿井提高生产。现在全矿形成了两个竞赛协作区：四井、七井帮助乌林立井，为第一协作区；三井、五井帮助六井，为第二协作区。
    “协作区竞赛”开展以后，矿党委一面加强领导，成立“协作区竞赛”委员会，组织各单位在人力、物力的互相支援，并且互通消息，交流经验，及时评比检查两个大协作区的竞赛成绩。另一方面，党委主要负责干部深入井口，帮助解决竞赛中的问题。
    在矿党委领导下，一个以集体为重、助人为乐的共产主义大协作竞赛广泛开展起来。七井发现乌林立井的运输跟不上生产需要，就派出运输段长、班长等帮助整理巷道，修理运输设备；矿的检运科也派八名修道工人，帮助换了七十米铁路线，使乌林立井的运输问题得到了解决。四井党支部书记和七井党支部书记，还从8月20日到31日一直在乌林立井帮助健全了管理制度。五井知道六井生产没有赶上，也主动抽出两个优秀掘煤队去支援。在先进矿井的帮助下，乌林立井在8月份超产了七百多吨煤，8月下旬的平均日产量比上、中旬提高9.1％。六井8月下旬的平均日产量比上旬提高4.1％。
