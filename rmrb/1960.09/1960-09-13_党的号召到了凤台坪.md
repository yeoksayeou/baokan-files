    The Party's Call Reaches Fengtaiping	中共武乡县委中心通讯组 (Central Communications Group of the Wuxiang County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party)
    In mid-August, after the Party's call for increased production and conservation and the instructions of the whole Party and the whole people to vigorously develop agriculture and grain production reached the Wuxiang County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, the County Committee immediately convened a meeting of the secretaries of the commune Party committees and some management area branch secretaries to convey and discuss the Party's instructions. Yang Xiaozhong, the secretary of the Fengtaiping Management Area of the Dayou Commune, was very excited after hearing the report and was eager to convey the spirit of the meeting to the commune members immediately.

    Unfortunately, it started to rain heavily as soon as the meeting ended. Yang Xiaozhong thought: Agricultural work is a matter of racing against time, and who knows when the rain will stop! He braved the heavy rain and walked fifty *li* of mountain road back to the management area, soaked to the skin. This matter quickly spread, and many commune members who were doing work indoors braved the rain to the management area office, and a mass gathering naturally formed. Xiaozhong didn't even bother to change his wet clothes and began to talk to everyone. He explained the principle put forward by Chairman Mao that agriculture is the foundation of national economic development, and grain is the foundation of the foundation, according to the County Committee's report. He also conveyed the instructions of the Party Central Committee to launch a production increase and conservation movement centered on grain and steel, and for the whole Party and the whole people to vigorously develop agriculture and grain production. Commune member Hao Sangou excitedly said, "Chairman Mao is so wise, there are thousands of people in the world, who can do without us farmers?" Wei Dan'tu, who liked to tell jokes, also said, "People are iron, food is steel, grain is really the foundation of the foundation." Zhang Haiming, the leader of the first production team, said, "We are doing the work of laying the foundation for socialist construction, and we must lay this foundation even better. We should start immediately. Our team guarantees to hoe the more than sixty *mu* of millet and forty *mu* of corn again within five days, and apply another thirty *dan* of fertilizer per *mu*, and apply two hundred *dan* of base fertilizer to the wheat fields." The third and fourth production team leaders spoke almost simultaneously, "We have the same conditions and want to compete with the first team." Dong Pu, the leader of the second team, said, "Our team will not lag behind either, but we must first understand the situation. I propose that we organize an inspection team to inspect the land piece by piece first, and then determine the measures piece by piece after the inspection." This suggestion was approved, and two inspection teams were established in a timely manner.

    The next day, early in the morning, the two inspection teams set off separately. This inspection adopted the method of discussing and formulating measures at the same time. As the sun set, many team members quietly said to the captain, "Let's just do it tonight!" Comrade Yang Xiaozhong had already known that the commune members had this trick, so he announced, "Everyone should actively respond to the Party's call, but the combination of work and rest is also the Party's instruction, and no one can violate it. Compete if you want to compete, but you can't work at night." The team members had no choice but to follow Yang Xiaozhong back to the canteen for dinner. But that night, no production team was idle, and they were all discussing and arranging tomorrow's work, preparing the furniture for tomorrow's use.

    On August 24, as the east just began to turn white, the members of the first production team set off. As they left the village, the second team was also assembled. Yang Xiaozhong said to the captain of the second team, "The first team has already left." This made Dong Pu, who had been holding back for a whole night, anxious, and he ran into the public canteen and said to the cook Zhang Shutian, "Today we will eat breakfast and lunch in the field." Before the cook could figure out what was going on, Dong Pu and his team members had already left the village. This competition between the four production teams was truly intense. The original plan was to universally weed the autumn crops and apply fertilizer once within five days, but all of them were completed ahead of schedule. Each production team also did a lot of things that were not planned, such as removing diseased plants in the millet fields; and some of the corn and millet that had been knocked down by the wind in those days were also promptly propped up, and so on. On August 28, the late-stage management of the autumn crops of the four production teams came to an end, and they promptly switched to the preparatory work for winter wheat sowing. Originally, the entire management area planned to plant two hundred *mu* of wheat this year, and all the wheat fields were plowed and harrowed three times, and 170 *dan* of fertilizer was applied per *mu*; now, they have revised the plan to expand the planting of wheat by another fifty *mu*, plow all the wheat fields once more, and apply 200 *dan* of fertilizer per *mu*. By September 2, all the wheat fields had been plowed once more, a total of four times; more than 7,000 *dan* of smoked fertilizer had been made for the wheat fields, more than double the plan; and the wheat seeds had been turned and dried. On September 5, the wheat sowing work began, and it is expected that all of it can be planted in early September.

    党的号召到了凤台坪	中共武乡县委中心通讯组
    8月中旬，党的增产节约的号召和全党全民大办农业大办粮食的指示到达中共武乡县委会以后，县委立即召开了公社党委书记和一部分管理区支部书记参加的会议，传达和讨论了党的指示。大有公社凤台坪管理区书记杨效忠听了传达很兴奋，恨不得立刻把会议的精神传达到社员中去。
    不巧，会议一结束就下起大雨来了。杨效忠想：农活是争分夺秒的事，谁知道雨什么时候才停呢！他冒着大雨走了五十里山路，赶回管理区去，浑身上下都湿透了。这件事很快就传开了，许多社员正在室内做活，这时都冒雨赶到管理区的办公室来，一个群众性的集会自然地形成了。效忠连湿衣服也顾不得换，就跟大家谈起来，他把毛主席提出的农业是国民经济发展的基础，粮食是基础的基础的方针，按照县委的报告向大家说了一遍，又把党中央提出开展一个以粮、钢为中心的增产节约运动和全党全民大办农业大办粮食的指示作了传达。社员郝三狗激动地说：“毛主席真英明，天下人民千千万，谁能离开咱务农汉？”爱说笑话的魏旦兔也说：“人是铁，饭是钢，粮食当真是基础的基础。”第一生产小队队长张海明说：“咱们是干的为社会主义建设打基础的工作，要把这个基础打得更好，现在马上就应该动手，我们队保证在五天之内把六十多亩谷子和四十亩玉茭再锄一遍，每亩再追肥三十担，麦田施底肥二百担。”第三和第四生产队长几乎是同时开口说：“我们也是同样条件，要跟第一队赛一赛。”第二队的队长董朴则说：“我们队也不会落后，可是咱们得先摸清底细，我提议咱们组织个检查组，先把地一块一块地检查一下，检查过后再一块一块地定措施。”这个意见得到了同意，及时就成立了两个检查组。
    第二天大清早，两个检查组就分头出发了。这次检查，采取了边议论边订措施的办法。太阳落了，好些队员悄悄地向队长说：“咱们今天晚上就干它一下子吧！”杨效忠同志早就知道社员们有这一手，就宣布说：“党的号召人人都应该积极响应，可是劳逸结合，也是党的指示，谁也不能违背，竞赛就竞赛，可不能开夜车。”队员们没办法，只好跟着杨效忠回食堂里来吃饭。可是这天晚上，那个生产队也没有闲着，都在讨论和安排明天的工作，准备明天应用的家具。
    8月24日，东方刚刚发白，第一生产队的队员们就出发了。他们刚出村，第二队也已集合。杨效忠对第二队队长说，第一队已经走了。这下可把这个蹩了一夜劲的董朴则急坏了，迎头跑进公共食堂，向炊事员张书田说：“今天我们早饭、午饭都在地里吃。”炊事员还没闹清这是怎么回事，董朴则早和他的队员们走出村去了。四个生产队这一场比赛，真是热烈紧张。原来计划五天中把秋作物普遍锄一次草，上一次追肥，结果都提前完成了。每个生产队还作了不少计划以外的事，比如谷地里拔除了病株；玉茭和谷子也因那几天刮了一场风，有的倒伏了，也都及时扶了起来，等等。8月28日，四个生产队的大秋作物后期管理告一段落，就及时转入冬麦播种的准备工作。原来，全管理区计划今年种二百亩麦子，所有麦地耕耙三次，每亩施肥一百七十担；现在，他们修订了计划，再扩种五十亩麦子，全部麦田再耕一次，每亩施肥二百担。到9月2日，全部麦田都多耕了一次，先后共耕了四次；为麦田造熏肥七千多担，超过计划一倍多；麦种都进行了翻晒。9月5日播麦工作开始了，预计9月上旬就可全部种完。
