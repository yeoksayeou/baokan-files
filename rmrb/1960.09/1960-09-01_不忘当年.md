    Do Not Forget the Old Days
    Bai Cang
    Comrade Zheng Shengyin, the Party General Branch Secretary of Chenqi Management Area in Zhengzhuang Commune, Yanchang County, Shaanxi Province, was transferred there by higher authorities this spring. He first suggested abolishing the management area cadre canteen, so that all cadres could eat in the same kitchen as the commune members. The management area had few houses, and the cadres had no place to live, so they were preparing to build new houses. Comrade Zheng Shengyin disagreed, saying: There are plenty of old cave dwellings, why must we build new houses? He borrowed two dilapidated cave dwellings and one cave dwelling used for storing grass from the masses, installed doors and windows, whitewashed them, and moved in with the cadres. The commune members were deeply moved when they saw this, and they said: This is our good cadre.
    Comrade Zheng Shengyin embodies the fine qualities of hard work, simplicity, and thrift in national construction that are characteristic of our Party's cadres. They are one with the masses, eating from the same pot, living in the same cave dwellings, and sharing the same joys and hardships, unwilling to make their lives special; unwilling to be detached from the masses in their lives, high above them, and isolating themselves from the masses.
    Eating from the same pot and living in the same cave dwellings with the masses also reminds us of the revolutionary predecessors who fought arduously in Yan'an and other base areas in those years. They ate, lived, and fought together with the masses, intimately and inseparably. The masses ate millet, cornmeal, and wild vegetables, and the cadres also ate millet, cornmeal, and wild vegetables; the masses lived in dilapidated cave dwellings, and the cadres also lived in dilapidated cave dwellings. Comrade Zheng Shengyin is an old cadre who joined the Red Army in 1933, was tempered by the Long March and the life in Yan'an, and still maintains the Party's fine traditions of hard work and simplicity.
    Today, we have entered the great period of socialist construction, and the conditions in all aspects are different from those in the Yan'an era: however, the principles of hard work and thrift in national construction will never change, and our Party's cadres, who have been tempered by long-term revolution, always maintain their fine traditions and revolutionary character - hard work and simplicity. Because they are not people who pursue immediate interests, they have far-sighted vision, lofty ideals, and great ambitions, and they are free from all low tastes. In a word, they are people who are dedicated to the people.
    Today, as we are victoriously carrying out socialist construction, we should not forget the old days of hard struggle, inherit fine traditions, and learn from the revolutionary predecessors' virtues of hard work, simplicity, and thrift.

    不忘当年
    白沧
    陕西延长县郑庄公社陈旗管理区党总支书记郑生银同志，今年春天由上级机关下放到那里，首先建议取消管理区干部食堂，让所有干部都和社员合灶吃饭。这个管理区住房少，干部没有住处，正准备新建房子。郑生银同志不同意，他说：有的是旧窑洞，为什么定要建新房子？他去借了群众两孔烂窑和一孔放草的窑，安上门窗，粉刷了一下，便和干部一块搬进去住。社员们看了都深为感动，他们说：这是我们的好干部。
    从郑生银同志身上，具体地体现了我们党的干部艰苦朴素、勤俭建国的优良品质。他们和群众打成一片，同灶吃饭，同住旧窑，同尝甘苦，不愿把自己生活特殊化起来；不愿在生活上脱离群众、高高在上、把自己和群众隔离起来。
    从和群众合灶吃饭、同住窑洞中间，也使我们想起了当年艰苦战斗在延安和别的根据地的革命先辈们，他们就是和群众同吃同住同战斗，亲密无间的，群众吃小米、棒子面、野菜，干部也吃小米、棒子面、野菜；群众住破窑洞，干部也住破窑洞。郑生银同志是一九三三年就参加红军的老干部，经过长征锻炼和延安生活的考验，现在仍保持了党的艰苦朴素的优良传统。
    今天，我们已经进入了社会主义建设的伟大时期，各方面的条件都跟延安时代不尽相同了：但是，艰苦奋斗，勤俭建国的原则是永不会改变的，而我们党的经过长期革命锻炼的干部始终保持着优良传统和革命本色——艰苦朴素。因为他们不是追求眼前利益的人，他们有的是远大的目光、崇高的理想和伟大的抱负，是摆脱了一切低级趣味的，一句话，他们是献身于人民的人。
    我们在胜利地进行社会主义建设的今天，应当不忘艰苦战斗的当年，继承优良传统，学习革命前辈们艰苦朴素、勤俭节约的美德。
