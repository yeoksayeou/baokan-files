    The People are the Foundation, Food is Heaven
            Zhou Chiping
        I
    The people are the foundation, food is heaven,
    With ample grain, what fear is there of famine years?
    Happy with the fruits of diligent labor,
    Smoke billows from every village hearth.
        II
    The worker-peasant alliance shines brightly,
    City and countryside helping each other to ensure steel and grain.
    Superior steel produces good agricultural machinery,
    In autumn, the fields are fragrant with rice and sorghum.
        III
    The Eight-Character Charter is the first hurdle,
    Agricultural machinery irrigation must not be neglected,
    Pesticides and fertilizers are indispensable,
    Every commune piles grain and cotton into mountains.
        IV
    Support agriculture by prioritizing the Four Modernizations,
    Send good quality, low-priced goods to the fields.
    Then the city granaries are full of grain,
    In gratitude for the support, we offer thanks.

    民为泰山食为天
            周赤萍
        一
    民为泰山食为天，
    粮多何惧遇荒年。
    辛勤劳动丰收乐，
    墟里滚滚上炊烟。
        二
    工农联盟放光芒，
    城乡互助保钢粮。
    优钢造出农机好，
    秋来田野稻粱香。
        三
    八字宪法首一关，
    农机排灌莫等闲，
    农药化肥不可少，
    社社粮棉堆成山。
        四
    支援农业先四化，
    物美价廉送田稼。
    尔来城中粮满仓，
    为感支援作酬谢。
