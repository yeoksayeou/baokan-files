    Striding into School
    Jin Jin
    This morning, this happy time,
    All kinds of flowers in the park,
    Are blooming towards the sun;
    Blooming especially beautifully, especially fragrant today.
    Because this day
    Is just like Children's Day on "June 1st."
    Listen, in the broadcast loudspeaker,
    A teacher is saying:
    "Dear children,
    You are up so early,
    You are entering school for the first time,
    Backpacks on your backs for the first time,
    To do a great thing,
    To learn culture well."
    Yes, everyone is welcoming,
    Welcoming you so warmly.
    Young Pioneers are standing at the entrance,
    Caring like older brothers and sisters,
    The teacher has prepared the first lesson,
    And is about to tell it to you.
    In our country,
    Thousands upon thousands of elementary school students have been added.
    You are walking with big strides,
    Feeling so happy in your hearts,
    Yes, you all know,
    You are the little masters of the country,
    Now you must learn to write,
    Do arithmetic,
    Learn language,
    In the future, learn your skills well,
    You will be the successors.
    Study hard when you are young,
    When you grow up, you will definitely work well.
    Studying should be brave,
    Should be focused,
    Don't run away when you encounter difficulties,
    Like the Liberation Army uncles fighting the enemy,
    Crush the stubborn bunkers fiercely.
    Year after year passes,
    The motherland becomes more beautiful day by day,
    When you grow up,
    Even better days will come.
    At that time, machines will be used everywhere,
    The countryside and the city will be equally bustling,
    Everyone will work hard,
    To build the communist
    Paradise.
    You, ah, are the successors
    To building the communist paradise.
    Maybe you will sit in spaceships,
    To set up a school on the moon;
    Or under the sea,
    Open an underground railway;
    Some of you will be agriculturalists,
    Growing wheat,
    As big as grapes.
    As long as you study culture well,
    These things can be done.
    Today, you enter the classroom,
    The teacher will tell you,
    Starting from the stars in the sky,
    All the way to the iron ore underground.
    After you finish reading book after book,
    Your bodies must also be trained to be strong,
    When you reach the age to join the League,
    Strive for the red scarf to flutter on your chest.
    With the Chinese Communist Party,
    You can grow up brave and strong,
    As strong as steel,
    Not afraid of wind and rain.
    Chairman Mao's words,
    You must never forget,
    That is: Study hard and make progress every day.

    跨着大步上学校
    金近今天这个早上，这个快乐的时光，公园里的各种鲜花，正迎着太阳开放；今天开得特别美，特别香。因为这个日子，就跟“六一”儿童节一样。你听，在广播喇叭里，有个老师在讲：“亲爱的小朋友们，你们起得真早，你们第一天进学校，第一次背上新书包，要做一件大事情，把文化学好。”对啊，大家都在欢迎，多么亲热地欢迎你们。少先队员们站在门口，像哥哥姐姐那样地关心，老师准备好第一课，就要讲给你们听。在我们的国家里，又添了千千万万个小学生。你们跨着大步子走路，心里是那么高兴，是啊，你们都知道，你们是国家的小主人，现在要学习写字，做算术，学语文，将来学好本领，你们就是接班人。小时候好好学习，大起来一定工作得挺好。学习要勇敢，要专心，碰到困难不要逃，像解放军叔叔打敌人，要狠狠炸碎顽固的碉堡。一年一年地过去，祖国一天比一天美好，等你们长大，更好的日子就要来到。那时候到处要用机器，乡下和城里同样地热闹，人人努力，要建设共产主义的
  天堂。你们啊，就是那建设共产主义天堂的接
  班人。说不定你们将坐起飞船，到月亮里去办学校；或者在大海下面，开一条地下铁道；你们有的要做农业家，种出麦子，大得像葡萄。只要你们好好学文化，这些事都能办得到。今天，你们走进课堂，老师就要对你们讲，从天上的星星讲起，一直讲到地下的铁矿。你们读完一本本的书，身体也要练得很强壮，到了入队的年纪，争取红领巾飘在胸膛。有了中国共产党，你们就能长得勇敢而又坚强，像钢铁一样结实，不怕风吹雨打。毛主席讲的话，你们永远不能忘，那就是：好好学习，天天向上。（附图片）上图：
