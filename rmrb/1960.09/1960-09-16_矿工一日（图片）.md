A Miner's Day

Recently, the reporter spent a tense and joyful day with the workers of Ren Guangjin's Youth Rapid Excavation Team at the Kangjiazhuang Mine of the Kailuan Coal Mine. Since the beginning of this year, this team has overfulfilled its tasks every month. From January to August, the average monthly advance in coal roadways was over 1,400 meters, reaching a maximum of 2,187 meters, becoming a red flag for rapid excavation on the coal industry front in Hebei Province.

These photos record fragments of the workers' production and life in this team.

    In the morning, at the pre-shift meeting, Ren Guangjin (second from the right), the leader of the 6:00 AM shift, assigns production tasks, ensuring that everyone has clear goals and is well-informed.

    Each shift is both a competitor and a helper. During shift handover, Guo Weibao (first from the left), the night shift leader, is briefing Ren Guangjin (center) on the situation and discussing the next steps.

    Double electric drill workers are engaged in a competition (from left to right: Xie Zhansheng, Yao Runtian, Ren Guangjin, Wang Shichang).

    They use double electric drills and long drill rods, increasing work efficiency by more than double. After work, they go to shower and sunbathe with sun lamps.

    During break time, the workers play chess with Zhao Shizhong (second from the right), the deputy secretary of the mine's Party committee.

    矿工一日
    最近，记者和开滦煤矿康家庄矿任广金青年快速掘进队的工人们在一起渡过了紧张愉快的一天。这个队今年以来月月超额完成任务，1至8月份平均月进煤巷一千四百米以上，最高达二千一百八十七米，成为河北省煤炭工业战线上快速掘进的一面红旗。
    这几张照片记录了这个队工人们生产和生活的片断。
                                        本报记者　时盘棋
    早晨，在班前会上，六点班的班长任广金（右二）布置生产任务，使人人目标明确，心中有数。
    各班既是竞赛对手，又是帮手。交接班时，夜班班长郭维保（左一）正向任广金（中）交代情况，研究下一步的工作方法。
    双电钻工人正在开展对手赛（从左至右：谢占胜、姚润田、任广金、王世昌）。
    他们使用双电钻、长钎子打眼，工效提高一倍以上。他们下班后就去洗澡、照太阳灯。
    在休息时间，工人们和矿党委副书记赵仕忠（右二）一起下棋。
