    Thinking So Thoughtfully for the Commune Members

    One morning, after a light rain, commune members of the Guozhuangzi Production Team of the Lugouqiao People's Commune in Beijing were weeding in the fields. A commune member noticed three people pushing a tricycle full of goods, moving along the muddy road after the rain. Someone said: Who is moving on a day like this? Guo Xueming, the Party Branch Secretary of the production team, stood up and saw: "Oh, it's not a move, it's the mobile truck from the Fengtai No. 1 Department Store, here to support our agricultural front line."

    The truck arrived at the field, and the commune members learned that among the three salespeople who came to the countryside were Han Likun, the Party Branch Secretary of the store! During the break, the commune members surrounded the truck, and towels and straw hats were passed from hand to hand.

    Several commune members asked the salespeople: Why didn't you bring rain boots on a rainy day? Han Likun saw that most of the commune members were wearing rain boots, so why would they want to buy more? So she asked the commune members. The commune members said: "The rain boots we are wearing are broken, and we want to buy a new pair." The three salespeople discussed it on the spot and believed that this was a sign of the commune members' gradual improvement in living standards, but supplying new ones while the old ones were not used would be a waste. Salesperson Gao Hongyi suggested: Let's start a repair service and turn the commune members' broken rain boots into good rain boots. This will not only solve the commune members' shoe problems, but also save state resources, killing two birds with one stone.

    They told the commune members their idea, and the commune members all agreed. The salespeople returned to the store to prepare tools and materials, and in a few days, they repaired 138 pairs of rain boots. The commune members praised: "The store thinks so thoughtfully for the commune members!" (Yin Qingxiang)

    为社员想得真周到
    一天上午，刚下过小雨，北京芦沟桥人民公社郭庄子生产队的社员们正在田间锄草。一个社员看见近处有三个人推着一辆满载东西的三轮车，在刚下过雨的泥泞的道路上行进。有人说：这是谁搬家呀，单找这个天。生产队党支部书记郭学明站起来一看：“唉，这不是搬家，这是丰台第一百货商店的流动货车，支援我们农业第一线来了。”
    货车来到地头，社员们才知道推车下乡的三个售货员中，还有商店党支部书记韩丽坤哩！休息的时候，社员们把货车围住了，毛巾、草帽一件件传到社员手里。
    有几个社员问售货员：下雨天，你们怎么不带点雨鞋来呀？韩丽坤一看大部分社员都穿着雨鞋，为什么还要买雨鞋呢？她就问社员。社员说：“穿着的雨鞋坏了，想买双新的。”三个售货员在地头上一商量，认为这是社员们生活逐步提高的表现，可是供应了新的，旧的不用了也是浪费。售货员高洪义提议：咱们开展修理业务，把社员的破雨鞋变成好雨鞋，这样不但解决了社员们的穿鞋问题，也节约国家物资，一举两得。
    他们把这个意见同社员们一说，社员们都说好。售货员回商店准备好工具、材料，几天工夫就修好了一百三十八双雨鞋。社员们称赞说：“商店为社员们想得真周到！”　（尹庆祥）
