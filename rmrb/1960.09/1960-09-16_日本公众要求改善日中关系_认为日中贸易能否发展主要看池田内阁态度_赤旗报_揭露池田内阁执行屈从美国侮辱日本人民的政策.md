Xinhua News Agency, Hong Kong, September 15th: Murayama Tomoyoshi, the head of the "Japanese Theater Troupe" who will be visiting China for performances, stated in Hong Kong on the 13th that he calls for an improvement in Sino-Japanese relations.

Murayama Tomoyoshi said that the former Kishi Nobusuke government of Japan pursued a policy of hostility towards China, which prevented the improvement of Sino-Japanese relations. However, China is friendly towards the Japanese people, and the Japanese people are not hostile to China. The Japanese people hope to enhance friendly relations between the two countries through cultural exchange.

Deputy head Takiwa Osamu pointed out that all Japanese cultural figures strongly support Premier Zhou Enlai's proposal on the signing of a non-aggression peace treaty among Asian and Pacific Rim countries, and the establishment of the entire region as a nuclear-weapon-free zone. Those engaged in cultural undertakings yearn for peace. Without a peaceful environment, art cannot develop. The Japanese people oppose the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" in order to strive for peace.

Deputy head Chida Koreya said that Liu Ningyi, chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, received a warm welcome from the Japanese people during his visit to Japan in July. He said that they hope that in addition to more Japanese people's representatives visiting China, Chinese representatives will also make friendly visits to Japan.

At the same time, Tanehashi Shigeru, the head of the Japan General Council of Trade Unions' Youth and Women's Delegation, told the Hong Kong press that whether Sino-Japanese trade relations will develop depends mainly on the attitude of the Ikeda government. The delegation he led visited our country in August and passed through Hong Kong on the 13th on their way back to Japan.

He told the Hong Kong press that he agrees with China's trade policy towards Japan, that is, the three principles of Sino-Japanese trade recently proposed by Premier Zhou. As for the relations between the two governments, the Chinese side still adheres to the past three political principles. He said that Premier Zhou Enlai believes that Sino-Japanese trade may increase, but there are still great obstacles at present. Therefore, if the Ikeda government does not change its policy, Sino-Japanese trade will be difficult to carry out.

Tanehashi Shigeru said that the rapid development of China's economic construction is hard to describe in words. China has concentrated the wisdom of 650 million people, and China can produce everything that capitalist countries can produce. He also talked about the leaping development of rural and urban people's communes in China and the vigorous cultural revolution in China.

Xinhua News Agency, September 15th: Tokyo dispatch: The Third National Women's Representative Conference of the Japan General Council of Trade Unions unanimously adopted the action policy. The policy stipulates that the 700,000 female workers of "Sohyo" will strengthen unity with other women's organizations and strive for the abolition of the new "Security Treaty" and the normalization of Sino-Japanese and Japanese-North Korean relations.

The conference was held in Tokyo on the 13th and 14th. 150 representatives of the 700,000 female workers belonging to "Sohyo" participated in the conference.

The action policy also stipulates that women's organizations will be established in all trade unions, and joint struggles with male workers will be strengthened to oppose the "enterprise rationalization" policy.

The policy exposes the discrimination suffered by Japanese female workers. The policy says that the wages of Japanese female workers are only 41% of those of male workers, and the monthly wages of most female workers are less than 8,000 yen.

The policy stipulates that Japanese female workers must launch a struggle to achieve equal pay for equal work and establish a nationally unified minimum wage system of 8,000 yen.

The policy stipulates that female workers will launch a struggle to demand the implementation of maternity leave for female workers.

The conference also decided that they will strengthen exchanges with Chinese female workers and various exchanges, and decided to send representatives to participate in the Asian-African Women's Conference scheduled to be held in Cairo.

Xinhua News Agency, September 15th: Tokyo dispatch: The Japanese Communist Party's organ "Akahata" published an article on the 15th regarding the Japan-U.S. talks held between Japanese Foreign Minister Zentaro Kosaka and U.S. Secretary of State Herter, pointing out that the released content of the talks shows that the Ikeda Cabinet will not only inherit the diplomatic line of the Kishi Nobusuke Cabinet, but will also more blatantly take the path of war and subservience to the United States.

"Akahata" condemned Kosaka for assuring the United States that the Ikeda Cabinet takes adhering to the new U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" as its basic policy.

The article condemned the Ikeda Cabinet for expressing loyalty to the United States in the U.S.-Japan joint communique and vowing to promote the establishment of a Northeast Asia Treaty Organization and continue its policy of hostility towards China and the Soviet Union.

"Akahata" pointed out that Kosaka and Herter expressed their hope to "expeditiously improve" Japan's relations with South Korea, and blatantly expressed their support for the Chang Myon puppet regime to deepen the division of Korea. At the same time, they also discussed the issue of strengthening the anti-communist system in the Far East.

"Akahata" pointed out that Foreign Minister Kosaka also assured Herter that Japan's policy towards China will be constantly consulted with the United States. These facts prove that the Ikeda Cabinet still does not want to restore diplomatic relations with China. The article also condemned Foreign Minister Kosaka for ignoring the Japanese people's indignation towards the heads of U.S. imperialism, and actually apologized to the United States again for Eisenhower being forced to cancel his visit to Japan, and promised to work hard to prevent similar incidents from happening again. The article pointed out that these facts show that the Ikeda Cabinet is implementing a diplomatic policy that is subservient to the United States and humiliates the Japanese people.

    日本公众要求改善日中关系
    认为日中贸易能否发展主要看池田内阁态度
    “赤旗报”揭露池田内阁执行屈从美国侮辱日本人民的政策
    新华社香港15日电　将到中国进行访问演出的“日本话剧团”团长村山知义13日在香港发表谈话，要求改善日中关系。
    村山知义说，日本前岸信介政府执行敌视中国的政策，以致日中两国的关系不能改善。但中国对日本人民是友好的，日本人民也没有敌视中国，日本人民希望通过文化交流以增进两国的友好关系。
    副团长泷泽修指出，所有日本的文化界人士，都极力支持周恩来总理提出的关于亚洲和太平洋沿岸各国签订互不侵犯的和平公约、把这整个地区建成为无核武器区的建议。从事文化事业的人，是渴望和平的。如果没有和平环境，艺术便无法发展。日本人民反对日美“安全条约”就是为了争取和平。
    副团长千田是也说，中华全国总工会主席刘宁一7月间访问日本时，受到了日本人民热烈的欢迎。他说，他们希望除了有更多的日本人民代表访问中国之外，也希望中国的代表到日本进行友好的访问。
    同时，日本工会总评议会青年与妇女代表团团长种桥茂对香港报界说，中日贸易关系是否有所发展，主要看池田政府的态度。他率领的代表团于8月间前来我国访问，13日路过香港回日本。
    他对香港报界说，他赞成中国对日本的贸易政策，即周总理最近提出的日中贸易三原则。至于日中两国政府的关系，中国方面还是坚持过去的政治三原则。他说，周恩来总理认为中日贸易可能增进，但目前还有很大的障碍。因此，如果池田政府不改变政策，日中贸易就很难进行。
    种桥茂说，中国经济建设的迅速发展，很难以言语来形容。中国集中了六亿五千万人的智慧，资本主义国家所能够生产的东西，中国都能够生产。他还谈到中国农村和城市人民公社的飞跃发展情况以及中国大搞文化革命的情况。
    新华社15日讯　东京消息：日本工会总评议会第三次全国妇女代表会议一致通过了运动方针。方针规定，“总评”的七十万女工将加强同其他妇女团体的团结，为争取废除新“安全条约”，争取日中、日朝邦交正常化而奋斗。
    会议是13日和14日在东京召开的。属于“总评”的七十万女工的代表一百五十人参加了会议。
    运动方针还规定，将在所有的工会中建立妇女组织，并且加强同男工的共同斗争，来反对“企业合理化”政策。
    方针揭露了日本女工遭受歧视的情况。方针说，日本女工的工资仅仅等于男工的41％，并且大部分女工的每月工资都不足八千日元。
    方针规定，日本女工们要展开斗争，争取同工同酬和建立全国统一的最低八千日元工资制。
    方针规定，女工将展开斗争，要求实行女工的产假。
    会议还决定，她们将加强同中国女工的往来和各种交流，并且决定派遣代表参加预定将在开罗召开的亚非妇女会议。
    新华社15日讯　东京消息：日本共产党机关报“赤旗报”15日就日本外务相小坂善太郎和美国国务卿赫脱举行的日美会谈发表文章指出，已经公布的会谈内容表明，池田内阁不仅要继承岸信介内阁的外交路线，而且要更加露骨地走战争和从属美国的道路。
      “赤旗报”谴责小坂向美国保证池田内阁以坚持新日美“安全条约”为它的基本政策。
    文章谴责池田内阁在日美联合公报中对美国表示忠诚，并发誓要推行建立东北亚条约组织和继续敌视中国和苏联的政策。
    “赤旗报”指出，小坂和赫脱表示希望“尽速改善”日本同南朝鲜的关系，并露骨地表示支持张勉傀儡政权，来加深朝鲜的分裂。同时，他们还商谈了在远东加强反共体系的问题。
    “赤旗报”指出，小坂外务相还向赫脱保证日本的对华政策将经常同美国商定。这些事实证明，池田内阁仍然不想同中国恢复邦交。文章还谴责外务相小坂忽视日本人民对美帝国主义头目的愤慨情绪，竟然就艾森豪威尔被迫取消访日一事再次向美国表示道歉，并且保证要为不再发生类似事件而努力。文章指出，这些事实表明池田内阁执行着屈从美国、侮辱日本人民的外交政策。
