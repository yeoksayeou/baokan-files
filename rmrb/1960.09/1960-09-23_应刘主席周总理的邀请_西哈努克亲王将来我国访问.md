Invitation Letter from Chairman Liu Shaoqi and Premier Zhou Enlai
To His Royal Highness Norodom Sihanouk, Head of State of Cambodia, Phnom Penh:
  Your Royal Highness,
    We have the honor to represent the government and people of the People's Republic of China in sincerely inviting Your Highness to visit our country in November this year.
    The people of China and Cambodia have a traditional friendship like that of relatives. In recent years, through mutual visits between the leaders of our two countries, this friendship has developed satisfactorily. We firmly believe that through Your Highness's visit, the friendly relations between our two countries based on the Five Principals of Peaceful Coexistence and the Ten Principles of the Bandung Conference will become closer and more developed, thereby making a greater contribution to promoting and maintaining peace in the Indochina region and Asia.
    Your Highness, we eagerly look forward to your visit.
    Please accept our sincerest regards and greetings to Her Majesty the Queen's health.
  Liu Shaoqi, Chairman of the People's Republic of China
  Zhou Enlai, Premier of the State Council of the People's Republic of China

Prince Sihanouk's Reply
To His Excellency Liu Shaoqi, Chairman of the People's Republic of China:
To His Excellency Zhou Enlai, Premier of the State Council of the People's Republic of China:
    Your Excellencies,
    I am deeply moved to receive your invitation, in the name of the government and people of the People's Republic of China, to visit your great country in November this year.
    I take this opportunity to express to you my sincere acceptance of this invitation and extend my warmest thanks for your lofty expression.
    As you have pointed out, this new visit will surely be conducive to strengthening and developing the relations existing between our two countries, which have been further strengthened by the recent visits to Cambodia by two great and outstanding friends of our people, Premier Zhou Enlai and Marshal Chen Yi.
    During my revisit to friendly People's China, I will have the opportunity to personally understand the brilliant achievements made by the Chinese people in all aspects under your wise leadership, and will be able to draw inspiration from them to benefit my country to the greatest extent.
    Cambodia is proud of the unwavering friendship that exists between our two countries. This friendship has been developed in the spirit of respecting the Bandung Principles and the principles of peaceful coexistence, for the sake of maintaining world peace and freedom.
    In this spirit, I would like to ask Your Excellencies to accept my deep gratitude and sincere, most sublime respect.
            Norodom Sihanouk
                  September 5, 1960
