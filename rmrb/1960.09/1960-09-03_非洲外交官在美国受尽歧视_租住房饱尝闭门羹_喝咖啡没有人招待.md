Xinhua News Agency, New York, August 31st: According to TASS, the "Washington Post and Times-Herald" revealed the racial discrimination suffered by diplomatic officials of African countries in the American capital. The newspaper wrote, "The District of Columbia (Editor's note: Washington, the capital of the United States, belongs to this district) is a bitter place for black diplomats."

The newspaper said that a military attaché from a certain African country "often received phone calls late at night from unidentified people, many of whom threatened him with violence. The military attaché eventually had to move away from his white neighbors."

"Recently, a diplomat from a proud independent African nation sat down in a bar and ordered a cup of coffee, and was refused service."

The newspaper pointed out, "It is this kind of treatment that makes African diplomats regard assignments to the embassy in Washington as difficult." The newspaper pointed out, "For diplomats from black countries, America's racial problems are something they have to face in their personal daily lives." The newspaper continued: "The most pressing issue for black diplomats in Washington is housing. This is not an easy matter for Africans." The newspaper quoted a high-ranking African diplomatic representative's bitter words, "If we are not suitable to live in this city, if this city does not want us, then why should we stay here? We might as well pack up and go home."

The newspaper also pointed out that three junior staff members of an African embassy have been living in hotels for several years because they could not rent houses. A high-ranking diplomat had to live in the attic of the embassy office during his three-year term.

The newspaper acknowledged that racism in the American capital takes the most deceptive forms. A barber refused to shave a first secretary of an African embassy, telling him to wait two weeks until the "shaving expert" was available. (Attached picture)

    非洲外交官在美国受尽歧视
    租住房饱尝闭门羹　喝咖啡没有人招待
    据新华社31日讯　据塔斯社纽约30日讯：“华盛顿邮报和时代先驱报”透露了非洲国家外交官员在美国首都受到种族歧视的情况。这家报纸写道，“哥伦比亚特区（编者注：美国首都华盛顿属于这个特区）对黑人外交官来说是一个辛酸的地方”。
    这家报纸说，某一非洲国家的一个武官“常常深更半夜接到不宣布姓名的人打来的电话，其中许多电话威胁要对他使用暴力。这位武官最后不得不迁离他的白人邻居”。
    “最近，一位来自一个自豪的非洲独立国的外交官在一家酒吧间坐下叫一碗咖啡，他被拒绝招待”。
    报纸指出，“就是这类待遇使得非洲国家的外交官把派往驻华盛顿大使馆的委任看作是艰难的事情。”报纸指出，“对于黑人国家的外交官来说，美国的种族问题是他们个人每天生活中不得不遇到的事情”。报纸接着说：“黑人外交官在华盛顿最迫切的问题是住宅问题。对非洲人来说，这不是件容易的事”。报纸引用一位职位很高的非洲国家外交代表的辛酸话说，“如果我们不适合在这个城市居住，如果这个城市不
  要我们，那么我们为什么还要留在这里呢？还不如卷铺盖回家去。”
    报纸还指出，某一非洲国家大使馆的三个低级工作人员由于租不到房子，已在旅馆里住了几年。一位职位很高的外交官在他三年的任期间，不得不住在使馆办公处的阁楼上。
    这家报纸承认，美国首都的种族主义具有最欺人的形式。一个理发师拒绝给一个非洲国家大使馆的一等秘书刮脸，叫他等两星期后“刮脸专家”在的时候再来。（附图片）
    艾森豪咸威尔：亲爱的非洲朋友，我们虽然相隔咫尺，可是美国对你们的友谊把我们紧紧地连在一起。
