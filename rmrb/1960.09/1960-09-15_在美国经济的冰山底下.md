    Underneath the Iceberg of the American Economy
    “The American economy is like an iceberg…dangerous things lurk beneath the surface.” An American journalist recently wrote this.
    Indeed, since the beginning of this year, the iceberg of the American economy has once again exposed its crises lurking on all sides. And recently, the situation has become even worse.
                  A Chorus of Declines
    As early as February, American industrial production began to stagnate and decline, a situation that lasted for half a year until July. The industrial production index for July was 109 (with the 1957 average as 100), two points lower than in January. And steel production, which serves as an economic "barometer," fell by 46.8% compared to the beginning of the year. Automobile production also fell by 35.9% compared to the beginning of the year. At the same time, the New York stock market has been fluctuating downwards since January. The prices of many stocks have fallen to the levels of the end of 1958. The construction industry, which has always been a pillar of the American economy, is also deteriorating. In the first seven months of this year, housing starts were 19% lower than in the same period last year. And housing starts in July fell by 26% compared to the same period last year.
    Company profits, another indicator of economic deterioration, have also declined. According to a survey of 721 large companies published by the First National City Bank of New York, American company profits in the second quarter of this year fell by 12% compared to the same period last year.
                  Unable to Turn the Tide
    Due to the sequential appearance of these typical examples of economic crisis, the US government had to adopt its consistent method of dealing with crises three months ago: relaxing credit to stimulate the economy. After the Federal Reserve lowered the federal bank discount rate from 4% to 3.5% in early June, it further reduced stock trading margins from 90% to 70% on July 27. Then on August 10, the discount rate was further lowered from 3.5% to 3%. In addition, it tried to increase the lending capacity of local banks. However, it was unable to turn the tide. Despite these continuous measures to ease monetary policy, they did not have a significant stimulating effect on bank lending and credit. From the end of June to the end of August, due to the continued sluggishness of businesses applying for loans from banks, American banks' industrial and commercial loans were reduced by more than $530 million. This is in stark contrast to the increase of more than $430 million in lending by banks during the same period last year. The reduction in corporate loans clearly shows that the decline in profits and the excess of inventory have already caused the American business community to accelerate its contraction. Therefore, the hope that the business community will significantly increase investment in the second half of the year to boost the economy has been completely dashed.
    At the same time, relaxing credit and lowering interest rates not only failed to stimulate the economy but also caused a large outflow of gold. As of September 8, the US gold reserves had fallen to their lowest point in twenty years, as the US had seen an outflow of more than $300 million in gold since July.
    Furthermore, and more seriously, American consumers are currently reducing their plans to purchase goods. According to a recent survey by the National Association of Manufacturers, American consumers' plans to purchase electrical appliances this year have decreased by 10% to 20% compared to last year, purchases of used cars have decreased by 25%, purchases of new homes have decreased by 27%, and purchases of used homes have decreased by 21%.
    In addition, according to a report by the US Department of Labor on September 9, the proportion of unemployed people in the US workforce increased from 5.4% in July to 5.9% in August.
                Anxious Mourning
    In this situation, some American newspapers and periodicals had to put away their optimistic tones and began to issue anxious mournings.
    The August 29 issue of "Newsweek" wrote in its business column, "Without a doubt, many typical examples of economic recession have long begun to show. The eight major indicators of economic activity used by the National Bureau of Economic Research to predict the turning points of business booms and busts were all lower in every month of 1960 than they were at their peak in 1959."
    Another American big business magazine, "Business Week," also recently conducted two surveys of economists on their views of the current economic situation. The results showed that "none of the dozens of people (all economists) who predict the economic outlook predicted that (the United States) would experience prosperity next year, only a few were optimistic about the economic outlook, and most were convinced that the United States was heading towards a recession." With few exceptions, the people surveyed by "Business Week" were divided into two camps. One camp believes that the United States "is already in a recession, most of whom believe that this recession began as early as February of this year." The other camp believes that the United States "is currently in the prelude to a real recession that will begin in early 1961, and many of them believe that the United States may be facing the most serious economic difficulties since World War II."

### 在美国经济的冰山底下

    在美国经济的冰山底下
    “美国经济像一座冰山……，在表面的底下潜伏着危险。”一个美国记者最近这样写道。
    的确，今年以来，美国经济的冰山又一次暴露出它四伏的危机。而在最近，情况更是越来越不好了。
                  一片下降声
    早从2月起，美国工业生产就开始出现停滞和下降，这种情况到7月份已持续半年之久。7月份的工业生产指数是109（以1957年平均数为100），比1月份低两点。而作为经济“晴雨表”的钢铁生产则比年初下降了46.8％。汽车工业的生产也比年初下降了35.9％。同时，纽约股票市场的行情从1月份起就一路在摇摇摆摆地下跌。许多股票的价格已跌到1958年年底的水平。一向是美国经济支柱的建筑业情况也同样在恶化。今年头七个月住房建筑的动工数字比去年同期低19％。而7月份住房建筑的动工数字则比去年同期下降了26％。
    作为经济情况恶化的另一指标的公司利润也出现了下降。根据纽约第一花旗银行发表的对七百二十一家大公司的调查，今年第二季美国的公司利润比去年同期下降了12％。
                  狂澜挽不住
    由于这些经济危机的典型例证的依次出现，美国政府曾不得不于三个月前就采取它所一贯采用的对付危机手法：放松信贷来刺激经济。美国联邦储备局于6月初把联邦银行贴现率从4％降低到3.5％后，7月27日又把股票交易保证金从九成减为七成。接着8月10日再把贴现率从3.5％降到3％。另外还设法提高了地方银行的放款能力。但是，狂澜挽不住。尽管有这些放松银根的连续措施，却没有能对银行放款和信贷发生显著的刺激效果。从6月底到8月底止，由于企业界向银行申请贷款的继续冷落，美国各银行放出去的工业和商业贷款缩减了五亿三千多万美元。这同去年同时期各银行增加了四亿三千多美元的放款恰好形成鲜明的对照。企业贷款的缩减，明白不过地说明，利润的下降和存货的过多已经使美国企业界在加速收缩。因此，希望企业界下半年会大量增加投资来繁荣经济的想法已经等于全部落空。
    同时，放松信贷、降低利息不但没有刺激经济反而引起了大量的黄金外流。截至9月8日止，由于美国从7月开始流出的黄金已超过三亿美元以上，美国黄金储备已下降到二十年来的最低点。
    此外，更严重的是美国一般消费者目前已经在减缩他们对商品的购买计划。据美国全国制造商协会最近的调查，今年美国消费者对电气用具的购买计划比去年减少了10％到20％，对旧汽车的购买缩减25％，对新房屋的购置减少27％，对旧房屋的购置减少21％。
    另外，根据美国劳工部9月9日的报道，美国失业人数占劳动力的比例已从7月份的5.4％增加到8月份的5.9％。
                不安的哀鸣
    在这种情况下，美国的一些报刊不得不收起乐观的调子，开始发出了不安的哀鸣。
    8月29日一期的“新闻周刊”在它的企业栏中就写道，“毫无疑问，经济衰退的许多典型例证早就开始显露出来。全国经济研究局用来预示企业盛衰的转折点的经济活动的八个主要指标，在1960年的每一个月里全都低于它们在1959年达到的高峰。”
    另一个美国大企业的杂志“商业周刊”最近也向经济学家们就当前经济形势的看法举行了两次调查，结果发现“数十名预测经济前景的人（全部是经济学家）没有一个预言明年（美国）会出现繁荣，只有很少人对经济前景看好，而大多数人都深信美国正在走向衰退。”除了少数例外，“商业周刊”所调查的人分成两派。一派认为美国“已经处在一次衰退中，其中大多数人认为这个衰退早在今年2月份就开始了。”另一派人认为美国“目前正处在一个将在1961年年初开始的真正的衰退的序幕阶段，其中许多人相信，美国可能正面临自从第二次世界大战以来空前未有的最严重的经济困难。”（亚）
