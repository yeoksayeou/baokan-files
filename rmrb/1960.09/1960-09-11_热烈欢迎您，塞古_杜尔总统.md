Xinhua News Agency, 10th. Today, over 500,000 people in Beijing took to the streets, warmly welcoming President Sékou Touré, the envoy of the heroic people of Guinea, and the government delegation of the Republic of Guinea he leads.

On the nearly eighty li stretch of road from the East Suburb Airport to the Guest House, welcoming crowds were almost everywhere.

When President Sékou Touré and Speaker Diallo Saifoulaye, accompanied by Chairman Liu Shaoqi, Premier Zhou Enlai, Chairman Zhu De, and Vice Chairman Peng Zhen respectively, entered the city in open-top cars, the people shouted slogans, waved flowers and flags, and the streets echoed with lively drumbeats and blazing firecrackers. As the distinguished guests passed through Tiananmen Square, thousands of colorful balloons rose into the sky above the square. In many places, groups of young women scattered flowers towards the distinguished guests, covering the ground. Today, the endless welcoming crowds and countless colorful flags filled the capital with a festive atmosphere. The distinguished guests were simply overwhelmed, continuously waving to the laughing crowds.

This is a day symbolizing the great solidarity of the Chinese and Guinean people, and the people of Asia and Africa. The grand and spectacular welcoming procession of over 500,000 people expressed the warmest welcome and deepest respect from Beijing and the 600 million people of China to the valiant Guinean guests. As Chairman Liu Shaoqi said in his welcoming speech at the airport: The victory of the Guinean people is also the victory of the Chinese people. The Chinese people will always steadfastly support the just struggle of the Guinean people.

As President Sékou Touré said at the airport: Due to a common hatred of imperialism, and a common will to eliminate imperialism, the Guinean and Chinese people are forever united!

Today, the welcoming crowds at the entrance of the airport were densely packed. The trees on both sides of the tree-lined avenue were adorned with colorful flags and small flags of China and Guinea. "Ah! I saw President Touré!" When President Touré, accompanied by Chairman Liu Shaoqi and Premier Zhou Enlai, passed by in an open-top car, a group of "Young Pioneers" from Tiansheng Middle School in the suburban Heping People's Commune shouted and jumped, waving their flowers to their hearts' content. The Beijing chrysanthemums and gold hydrangeas exuded the same fragrance as the pineapples and rosewood of Guinea.

These flowers had cost the children a lot of effort. Last night, when they heard that they were going to welcome guests from Africa, they were thrilled. They automatically braved the dark night and thunderstorms to search for flowers and collect colorful flags. Twelve-year-old Zhang Yufu, soaked in the rain, picked a large bunch of wildflowers in the fields. He felt the flowers were not bright enough, so he rushed to Grandma Zhang's house, more than one or two li away. The old lady understood the child's intentions and said, "Take the flowers! Express the feelings of our Chinese people!"

In the crowded welcoming crowd, Xu Jianxiang, a model worker from Beijing Industry, was particularly excited. When President Touré passed in front of their ranks, Xu Jianxiang took the lead in shouting: "Long live the victory of the people of the world in their struggle against imperialism!"

Xu Jianxiang got up at four o'clock this morning and called on his companions to come together. Xu Jianxiang grew up overseas, and his father was killed by the claws of Dutch imperialism. Xu Jianxiang, who has a deep-seated hatred for imperialism, said that more than two years ago, the Guinean people were oppressed and exploited by imperialism. But imperialism was finally driven away by the heroic Guinean people. The Chinese people understand the past suffering of the Guinean people, and understand their struggle today even more. The friendship between our two peoples is as hard as the diamonds that Guinea is rich in, and as shiny as diamonds.

On the Construction Road in the factory-lined eastern suburbs, the distinguished guests from Guinea warmly waved to Wang Enyu, a foundry worker from the molding workshop of the Beijing No. 1 Machine Tool Plant, who was standing in front of the welcoming crowd. He was very excited and immediately wrote a poem:

"Thousands of miles apart, ten thousand miles apart, we often think of our African brothers. Welcome, respected President, please take the heart of the Chinese workers. The people of China and Guinea are linked heart to heart, we will always hold arms tightly together on the anti-imperialist front. Mountains and rivers cannot separate our friendship, across mountains and waters, I see from afar in Beijing: Guinea is heading towards a rising red sun, galloping forward!"

Tiananmen Square was transformed into an ocean of boiling crowds. More than 100,000 officers and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army, militiamen, workers, cadres of government departments and students, beat drums and gongs, and waved red flags. The balconies of many tall buildings nearby were also densely packed with people. Some old women, holding children, waved to the distinguished guests from afar. When the open-top car entered the square, thousands of colored balloons rose into the sky, with huge banners hanging from the large balloons that read "Salute to the heroic people of Guinea!" "Long live the friendship between the Chinese and Guinean people!" When the distinguished guests passed in front of the PLA and militia ranks, more than 40,000 PLA soldiers and fully armed militiamen shouted slogans, expressing the Chinese people's firm support for the African people's and the Guinean people's struggle for national independence against imperialism. Song Zhongwen, a captain of the former Volunteer Army who had severely defeated American imperialism on the Korean battlefield, said: "China and Guinea are separated by thousands of miles, but a common experience connects us. As long as we strengthen unity and persist in struggle, we will surely be able to defeat imperialism and defend world peace." The soldiers watched President Sékou Touré, who was standing on the car shoulder to shoulder with Chairman Liu Shaoqi and Premier Zhou Enlai. Militia fighter Liu Denghan happily said, "This is China and Guinea advancing shoulder to shoulder."

Members of rural and urban people's communes came from all directions to welcome the distinguished guests. In the Jianguomen area, a welcoming crowd of ten urban people's communes gathered, many of whom were elderly street women with white hair. When the distinguished guests' cars drove up from afar, Tang Shuzhen, the factory director of the Jinqi Inlay Factory of the Jianguomen People's Commune and mother of six children, who was standing at the front of the crowd, shouted excitedly, "The distinguished guests are here!" while clapping her hands vigorously. Liu Zongxiu, the deputy factory director standing next to her, who was also a housewife in the past, immediately beat the drums and gongs even faster.

On Fuxingmenwai Street, more than 500 members of the Yuyuantan People's Commune from the suburbs shouted, "Welcome, President Sékou Touré!" Last night, after hearing the news that President Touré would be welcomed today, the members were so excited that they couldn't sleep. Some rushed to make the national flags of China and Guinea, and others prepared new clothes. As soon as it dawned, the members gathered and lined up to welcome them. More than 100 female workers from the commune's machinery repair shop finished their production tasks ahead of schedule today, and put on new clothes to welcome the distinguished guests. Seeing the arrival of the distinguished guests, an old farmer in his seventies blurted out: "High mountains and long roads deepen friendship, President Touré is happy to come. China and Guinea are separated by thousands of miles, the people of the two countries are linked heart to heart."

More than 10,000 university students waited enthusiastically in front of the Guest House. There, the sound of firecrackers, drums and gongs, and slogans intertwined into a joyful symphony. The girls of the Uygur, Kawa, Li, and Daur ethnic groups from the Central Institute for Nationalities, holding flowers, waved frequently, warmly expressing the sincere friendship of the Chinese people of all ethnic groups towards the Guinean people.

Cai Yan, a teacher at the Beijing Institute of International Relations, had just returned from a visit to Guinea not long ago, and today she joined the capital's youth in welcoming the esteemed Guinean president. During her visit to Conakry, the warm reception of the Guinean people deepened the understanding and friendship between the Chinese and Guinean people. At a reception, she heard the Guinean people singing about their independence and freedom, and praising their outstanding leader, Sékou Touré. She felt particularly excited today when she welcomed the Guinean president, who is deeply loved by the people, in her own country. A teacher in Conakry once said to Cai Yan: The Chinese people are true friends of the African people. On the streets of Conakry, when the Guinean people and Chinese friends met face to face, they always greeted each other with smiles and warm greetings. Now, the distinguished guests from Guinea have come to our country, and they are greeted with countless flowers and overwhelming enthusiasm. Now, the friendship between the Asian and African people is getting deeper and deeper. When the motorcade of distinguished guests drove past the crowd welcoming them, people couldn't help but shout, "Salute to the heroic people of Guinea!" The Government Delegation of the Republic of Guinea led by President Sékou Touré arrived in Beijing. (Attached picture)

    热烈欢迎您，塞古·杜尔总统
    首都五十万群众，在八十里路上挥舞旗帜、鲜花，敲打锣鼓，燃放鞭炮，载歌载舞，欢呼中几人民的友谊万岁，表达了六亿中国人民的最深切的敬意。
    新华社10日讯　今天，北京五十多万群众走上街头，怀着巨大的热情欢迎英雄的几内亚人民的使者塞古·杜尔总统，欢迎他所率领的几内亚共和国政府代表团。
    在从东郊机场到迎宾馆的将近八十华里长的道路上，几乎到处都有欢迎的人群。
    当塞古·杜尔总统和迪阿洛·塞福拉耶议长分别由刘少奇主席、周恩来总理和朱德委员长、彭真副委员长陪同，乘坐敞篷汽车进入市区时，人们高呼着口号，挥舞着鲜花和旗帜，街道上响起了一片热闹的锣鼓声和炽烈的鞭炮声。贵宾们经过天安门广场时，广场的上空升起了成千成万五彩缤纷的气球。在许多地方，成群的女青年们把投向贵宾的鲜花撒了满地。今天，一眼望不尽的欢迎人群，数不清的万千彩旗，使首都充满了节日般的气氛。贵宾们在车上简直目不暇顾，他们不停息地向大声欢笑的人群招手致意。
    这是象征着中几人民、亚非人民伟大团结的一天。五十多万人的盛大壮观的欢迎队伍，表达了北京以及全中国六亿人民对英勇斗争的几内亚贵宾们最热烈的欢迎和最深切的敬意。这正如刘少奇主席在机场上致欢迎词时所说的：几内亚人民的胜利，也就是中国人民的胜利。中国人民永远坚定不移地支持几内亚人民的正义斗争。
    也正如塞古·杜尔总统在机场上所说的：由于对帝国主义的共同仇恨，由于消灭帝国主义的共同意志，把几内亚人民和中国人民永远团结在一起！
    今天，在机场门口的林荫道上欢迎的队伍挤得密密层层。两旁的树木被彩旗和中几两国的小国旗点缀得五彩缤纷。“啊！我见到杜尔总统了！”当杜尔总统在刘少奇主席和周恩来总理的陪同下，乘着敞篷汽车经过的时候，郊区和平人民公社天生中学的一群“红领巾”嚷着，跳着，他们尽情地挥舞着鲜花。北京的黄菊花、金绣球同几内亚的菠萝、花梨树散发出同样的芳香。
    这些鲜花曾使孩子们费了一番苦心。昨天夜里，当他们听说要欢迎来自非洲的贵宾时，大伙沸腾起来了，他们自动地冒着漆黑的夜晚和雷阵雨，四出寻找鲜花和搜集彩旗。十二岁的张玉甫淋着雨在野地里采了一大捧野花，他嫌花朵还不够鲜艳，又赶到一二里以外的张老奶奶家。老奶奶明白孩子的心意，她说：“把鲜花采去吧！表表咱们中国人民的心意！”
    在济济的欢迎人群中，北京工业劳动模范许建祥的心情特别激动。当杜尔总统在他们队伍前经过的时候，许建祥带头高呼：“全世界人民反对帝国主义的斗争胜利万岁！”
    今天清晨四点多钟，许建祥就起床了，招呼伙伴们一起赶来。许建祥从小生长在海外，他的父亲就是被荷兰帝国主义的爪牙打死的。对帝国主义有着刻骨仇恨的许建祥说，两年多以前，几内亚人民受着帝国主义的压迫和欺榨。但是帝国主义终于被英勇的几内亚人民赶走了。中国人民懂得几内亚人民往日的苦难，更懂得他们今天的斗争，我们两国人民的友谊，正像几内亚盛产的金刚石一样坚硬，像金刚石一样闪闪发光。
    在工厂林立的东郊建设路，几内亚的贵宾向站在欢迎队伍前面的北京第一机床厂模铸车间铸工王恩宇热情地招手，他心情十分激动，当即作了一首诗：
    “远隔千里，远隔万里，我们常常思念非洲的兄弟。欢迎您，尊敬的总统，请您带去中国工人的心意。中几两国人民心心相连，反帝战线上我们永远紧挽手臂。山山水水隔不断我们的友谊，隔山隔水，我在北京遥遥望见：几内亚正迎着一轮红日，向前驰去！”
    天安门广场汇成了万众沸腾的海洋。十多万解放军官兵、民兵、工人、机关干部和学生，敲着锣鼓，挥动着红旗。在附近许多高大建筑物的凉台上，也都密密地站满了群众。一些老大娘，抱着孩子远远地向贵宾招手，当敞篷汽车进入广场时，成千个彩色气球升入高空，大气球上悬挂着“向英雄的几内亚人民致敬！”“中国和几内亚人民的友谊万岁！”等巨幅标语。当贵宾们经过解放军和民兵队伍前面时，四万多解放军战士和全副武装的民兵高呼口号，表达中国人民对非洲人民、几内亚人民争取民族独立反对帝国主义斗争的坚决支持。曾经在朝鲜战场上痛击过美帝国主义的原志愿军宋中文大尉说：“中国和几内亚相隔万里，共同的遭遇把我们联系在一起，只要我们加强团结，坚持斗争，就一定能够击败帝国主义，保卫世界和平。”战士们目送着与刘少奇主席、周恩来总理并肩立在车上的塞古·杜尔总统，民兵战士刘登翰高兴地说，“这是中国和几内亚肩并肩在前进。”
    城乡人民公社的社员们，从四面八方赶来欢迎贵宾。在建国门一带，聚集了有十个城市人民公社的欢迎队伍，其中有许多是白发苍苍的街道妇女。当贵宾的车子远远地驶来时，站在队伍前头的六个孩子的母亲、建国门人民公社金漆镶嵌厂厂长唐淑贞兴奋地高呼：“贵客来了！”一边不停地使劲地鼓掌。站在她旁边的从前也是家庭妇女的副厂长刘宗秀，立即用更快的动作敲打着锣鼓。
    在复兴门外大街上，来自郊区玉渊潭人民公社的五百多名社员高呼：“欢迎您，塞古·杜尔总统！”昨天晚上，社员们听到今天要欢迎杜尔总统的消息后，都高兴得不能入睡，有的赶制中几两国国旗，有的准备新装。天刚亮，社员们就集合整队前来欢迎。这个公社机械修配厂的一百多名女工，今天提前赶出了生产任务，个个穿起新装，也来欢迎贵宾。看到贵宾到来，一位七十多岁的老农民随口吟道：“山高路远情谊深，杜尔总统喜来临。中几相隔千万里，两国人民心连心。”
    一万多大学生热情地等候在迎宾馆的门前。在那里，鞭炮声、锣鼓声、口号声交织成一支欢乐的交响乐。中央民族学院的维吾尔族、佧佤族、黎族和达斡尔族的姑娘们，举着鲜花频频挥舞，热情洋溢地表露出中国各族人民对几内亚人民的真挚友情。
    北京国际关系学院教师蔡焰，刚从几内亚访问回国不久，今天也和首都青年一起欢迎尊贵的几内亚总统。在科纳克里访问期间，几内亚人民的盛情接待加深了中几两国人民的了解和友谊。在一次招待晚会上，她听到几内亚人民歌唱着自己的独立和自由，歌颂着领导他们的杰出领袖塞古·杜尔。她今天在自己祖国迎接这位深受人民爱戴的几内亚总统时，感到特别兴奋。科纳克里市的一位教师曾跟蔡焰说：中国人民是非洲人民真正的朋友。在科纳克里街头，几内亚人民和中国朋友迎面相见时总是微笑和热情的问候。现在，几内亚的贵宾来到了我国国土，迎接他们的是无数鲜花和难以抑制的热情。现在，亚非人民之间的友谊愈来愈深。当贵宾的车队由欢迎他们的人群面前驶过时，人们都情不自禁地高呼起来，“向英雄的几内亚人民致敬！”塞古·杜尔总统率领的几内亚共和国政府代表团到北京。（附图片）
