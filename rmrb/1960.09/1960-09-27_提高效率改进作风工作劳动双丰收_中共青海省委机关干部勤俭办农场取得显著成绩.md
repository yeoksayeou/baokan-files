　　Xinhua News Agency, Xining, 26th: Under the guidance of the thought of "self-reliance and ample food and clothing," the cadres of the Qinghai Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, after two years of efforts, have built farms with more than 8,400 mu of cultivated land on the shores of Qinghai Lake, in the suburbs of Xining, and in Ledu County in the eastern agricultural area. The farms also have livestock farms, pig farms, poultry farms, fish ponds, fishing teams, and farm tool repair shops and processing plants serving farm production and organ life. This year, the entire farm has sown more than 4,000 mu of spring wheat, highland barley, and other food crops, more than 1,000 mu of rapeseed, and 520 mu of vegetables. By the end of August, 520,000 jin of vegetables and more than 300,000 jin of fish had been harvested, as well as a large amount of meat. Since the beginning of this year, the meat and vegetables consumed by the cadres and families of the Provincial Committee have been entirely supplied by the farms and hunting teams. Currently, the farm has more than 200 pigs in stock, 3,400 chickens and ducks, and by the end of the year, everyone can store a large amount of vegetables.

　　Two years ago, the Qinghai Provincial Committee Organ Farm only had more than 200 mu of cultivated land, which was developed on the basis of cadres planting experimental fields. After the establishment of this farm, it not only produced a large amount of grain, vegetables, and meat, but also became a place for cadres of the Provincial Committee to engage in labor training. Last year, all cadres of the Provincial Committee spent an average of more than one month working on the farm, and this year the labor time has increased. Through regular labor training on the organ farm, cadres' labor viewpoint has been greatly enhanced, and their socialist awareness has been continuously improved. At the same time, due to the large-scale operation of organ farms, the cadres of the Provincial Committee have more firmly established the idea that agriculture is the foundation of the national economy and grain is the foundation of the foundation. In addition to directly participating in agricultural production and creating a large amount of material wealth, they also provided timely support for the development of agricultural production in the people's communes.

　　In the two years of establishing the organ farm, the cadres of the Qinghai Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China have always carried forward the spirit of hard struggle, solving problems such as land, funds, seeds, and fertilizers by their own efforts. In the early days of the farm's establishment in the winter of 1958, they braved the severe cold wind to transform the land abandoned by the masses in the suburbs of Xining. This was a piece of land full of alkali and "yangnaoshi" (a raw material for burning lime). They used iron shovels and hoes to dig out pieces of "yangnaoshi" weighing dozens of kilograms that were deeply embedded in the soil, and then carried out deep plowing and soil improvement. They sold the dug-out "yangnaoshi" for 30,000 yuan, accumulating the first batch of funds for the farm. In 1959, the farm had a surplus of more than 7,000 yuan after offsetting income and expenditure. This spring, a group of cadres went to Gangcha County on the shores of Qinghai Lake to prepare for the construction of a new farm. At that time, the Gangcha grassland was frozen and covered with snow. They built new homes with their own hands while reclaiming wasteland and building earth cave dwellings, reclaiming and sowing more than 5,800 mu of land.

　　Correctly arranging organ work and labor production time, and ensuring the labor force for the farm's year-round production while doing a good job in organ work, is the key to the rapid development of the Qinghai Provincial Committee Organ Farm. While fixing a small number of management cadres and some farm workers, the Provincial Committee Organ Farm adopted the method of organizing cadres to participate in regular labor during spare time, combined with organizing cadres and family members to form temporary professional teams for shock work according to the production season to solve the labor force necessary for farm production. At the same time, in order to take care of the work characteristics of each unit, the farm also contracted farm work to each unit, and each unit arranged its own labor force and labor time. In addition, each department and committee reasonably arranged work, improved work efficiency, and improved work style, so as to achieve a double harvest in labor and work.

　　Now, the cadres of the Qinghai Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China are simultaneously rushing to harvest crops and preparing for the expansion of the farm and next year's production. Subordinate units have drawn a group of cadres and family members to go to Guinan, Jianzha, Menyuan and other counties to prepare for the establishment of new farms. In order to meet the needs of farm development, a batch of farm tools such as tractors and water pumps have been purchased using the farm's accumulated funds, and preparations are being made to establish a machinery repair shop.

　　提高效率改进作风工作劳动双丰收
　  中共青海省委机关干部勤俭办农场取得显著成绩
    据新华社西宁26日电　中共青海省委机关干部在“自己动手，丰衣足食”的思想指导下，经过两年的努力，在青海湖畔、西宁郊区和东部农业区乐都县等地建成了拥有八千四百多亩耕地的农场，并附设有畜牧场、养猪场、养禽场、养鱼池、捕鱼队，以及为农场生产和机关生活服务的农具修配厂和加工厂等。今年全场共播种春小麦、青稞等粮食作物四千多亩，油菜一千多亩，蔬菜五百二十亩。到8月底，已经收获蔬菜五十二万斤，捕鱼三十多万斤，还有大批肉类。今年以来省委机关干部和家属所吃的肉食、蔬菜，完全由农场和狩猎队供给，现在农场还有存栏猪二百多头，鸡、鸭三千四百多只，到年底每人还可以储备大批蔬菜。
    两年前的青海省委机关农场，只有二百多亩耕地，是在干部种试验田的基础上发展起来的。这个农场创办后，不仅生产出大批粮食、蔬菜和肉类，而且成为省委机关干部进行劳动锻炼的一个场所。去年省委机关全体干部平均每人在农场劳动了一个月以上，今年劳动时间又有了增加。通过在机关农场经常性的劳动锻炼，干部的劳动观点大大增强，社会主义觉悟不断提高。同时，由于大办机关农场，省委机关干部都更加坚定地树立了农业是国民经济的基础、粮食是基础的基础的思想，他们除自己直接参加农业生产，创造了大量物质财富外，还对人民公社发展农业生产进行了及时的支援。
    中共青海省委机关干部在建立机关农场的两年中，始终发扬了艰苦奋斗的精神，自己动手解决土地、资金、种籽、肥料等问题。在1958年冬天农场初建的日子里，他们冒着凛冽的寒风，到西宁郊区去改造群众弃耕的土地。这是一片满是盐碱和羊脑石（一种烧石灰的原料）的土地。他们用铁铣和镢头，把一块块深深陷入泥土中的几十斤重的羊脑石挖出来，然后进行深翻和改良土壤工作。他们把挖出的羊脑石卖得三万元，为农场积累了第一批资金。1959年农场收支相抵，还盈余七千多元。今年春天，一批干部到青海湖畔的刚察县筹建新场。那时，刚察草原冰封地冻、风雪飘舞。他们一边开荒一边修筑土窑洞，用自己的双手建立起了新的家园，开荒播种了五千八百多亩土地。
    正确安排机关工作和劳动生产时间，在搞好机关工作的同时保证农场常年生产的劳动力，是中共青海省委机关农场得到迅速发展的关键。省委机关农场在固定少量管理干部和部分农场工人的同时，采取利用业余时间组织干部参加经常性劳动，与根据生产季节组织干部和家属成立临时专业队进行突击相结合的办法，解决农场生产所必需的劳动力。同时，为了照顾各单位的工作特点，还把农活包干给各单位，由各单位自己安排劳动力和劳动时间。此外，各部、委都合理安排工作，提高工作效率和改进工作作风，从而做到了劳动工作双丰收。
    现在，中共青海省委机关干部正在一面抢收庄稼，一面进行农场的扩建和明年的生产准备工作。所属各单位已经抽出一批干部和家属，分赴贵南、尖扎、门源等县筹办新农场。为了适应农场发展的需要，利用农场的积累购置了一批拖拉机、抽水机等农具，并且正在筹备建立一个机械修配厂。
