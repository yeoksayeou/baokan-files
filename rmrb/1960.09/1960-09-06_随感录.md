Random Thoughts
    Dan Jiushan

    After the cadres in the Shantou area of Guangdong Province went deep into the grassroots, they had a very profound feeling. They said: "In the past, sitting in the office was like sitting in a well and looking at the sky. Now, going deep down is like climbing a mountain and looking at the sea."

    "Sitting in a well and looking at the sky" and "climbing a mountain and looking at the sea" are indeed two completely different realms. One is blocked from the outside world, short-sighted, and narrow-minded like a well; the other is far-sighted, broad-minded, and as vast as the sky and the earth. Why is there such a difference? The key lies in: connecting with reality and connecting with the masses.

    Reality and the masses are the ocean of life. There are big fish in deep water, and only those who are determined to go into the water can truly catch big fish; only those who connect with reality and connect with the masses can discover problems in time and solve them effectively.

    Although there is water in the well, big fish will not live in the well. Those who aspire to catch big fish should go deep into the sea.

    广东汕头地区的干部深入到基层中去以后，有一种很深切的感受，他们说：“过去蹲在机关，有如坐井观天，现在深入下去，好比登山望海。”
    “坐井观天”和“登山望海”，确实是两种截然不同的天地。一则是耳目闭塞，眼光短浅，胸怀狭窄得像一口井；一则是高瞻远瞩，目光远大，心胸广阔得像天地那么大。为什么有这样的不同？关键就在：联系实际、联系群众。
    实际、群众，这是生活的海洋。深水有大鱼，决心下水的人，才能真正捕捉住大鱼；联系实际，联系群众的人，才能及时发现问题，有效地解决问题。
    井里虽然有水，但是大鱼是不会在井里生活的，有志于捕捉大鱼的人，应该深入到大海里去。
