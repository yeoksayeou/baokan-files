    Comprehensive Renovation, Coordinated Use, Primarily Indigenous, From Coarse to Refined
    Qiannan's Tool Reform Advances Towards Serialization
    The prefecture has reformed and promoted over 500 types of new tools, totaling over 2 million pieces
    (Our dispatch) The tool reform movement in the Qiannan Buyi and Miao Autonomous Prefecture has entered a new stage under the guidance of continuous revolution, namely, from sporadic tool improvements to systematic tool reforms, and from the reform of individual processes to the comprehensive renovation of all types of work.
    During the water conservancy construction movement last winter and this spring, people of all ethnic groups displayed the communist spirit of daring to think, daring to speak, and daring to act, vigorously creating, reforming, and promoting new tools, and realized serialized construction with indigenous machinery, greatly improving labor efficiency. Encouraged by this successful experience, the tool reform movement in the prefecture has progressed very rapidly. From November last year to August this year, the prefecture reformed and promoted more than 500 types of new tools, totaling more than 2 million pieces, more than double the total of the previous two years. The large-scale emergence of new tools has promoted the tool reform movement to develop in the direction of serialization. Now, there are new tools or indigenous machinery for agricultural cultivation, short-distance transportation, product processing, and domestic cooking. In areas where progress has been faster, various new tools have been assembled into complete sets.
    The Qiannan mountainous area has rugged roads and scattered arable land. In the past, transportation relied on carrying and backpacking, and the labor days used for transportation accounted for about half of the total labor days. After a large-scale promotion of new machines and tools such as ox carts, horse carts, pack oxen, pack horses, chutes, and inclined troughs, although the amount of transportation has been increasing day by day, the labor days used for transportation have decreased to one-third of the current amount. Weng'an County has implemented a system of automobiles running on main lines, ox and horse carts running on branch lines, indigenous trains and handcarts running in the fields, wooden sailing boats on rivers, and slides and chutes climbing high mountains, basically realizing "one-stop" fixed-line transportation, greatly increasing the amount of transportation, overfulfilling the transportation tasks, and winning the red flag award from the Ministry of Communications. Transplanting, threshing, and field transportation, which used to require a lot of labor in cultivation, have also been mostly replaced by advanced tools. The red flag commune of tool reform in the prefecture, Zisong Commune in Wangmo County, has adopted new tools for plowing, harrowing, sowing, transplanting, weeding, hoeing, topdressing, drought resistance, and pest control, basically realizing the serialization of new agricultural tools. Now a batch of new tools for harvesting, threshing, etc., have been rushed out to fully prepare for the matching of new agricultural tools for autumn harvest. This year, about 40% of the paddy fields in the prefecture were transplanted by transplanting machines, and about 80% were weeded by weeding harrows. The long-awaited days of "transplanting without bending over and weeding without using hands and feet" are gradually being realized.
    Under the slogan of "manufacturing in sets, reforming in sets, and promoting in sets," Party committee secretaries at all levels took personal command, focusing on the matching of new tools, supplementing whatever was lacking, and concentrating efforts on tackling missing tools. During the summer harvest, harvesting and threshing were two backward processes. Libo Commune in Dushan County focused on creating harvesters and combined wheat threshers suitable for mountainous areas. After fourteen failures, it finally produced the "Dushan No. 2 Animal-Powered Harvester," which won praise at the Southwest Three Provinces Summer Harvest Tool Reform Experience Exchange Meeting. The harvester is matched with animal-powered carts, threshing machines, etc., and the main processes of harvesting, transportation, and threshing have basically realized the serialization of new agricultural tools. The commune not only completed the summer harvest half a month ahead of schedule but also saved 40% of the labor force.
    Once new tools are serialized, they become even more powerful. Maoying Commune in Changshun County started using transplanting machines for transplanting, generally transplanting about two mu per day, and up to six mu at the highest, which is one to five times more efficient than manual transplanting. Later, each transplanting machine was equipped with a seedling replacer, and every three to five transplanting machines were equipped with a seedling puller and a seedling washer, increasing transplanting efficiency by twenty times compared to manual transplanting. Zisong Commune in Wangmo County equipped the corn seeder with a fertilizer applicator, so that the four processes of nesting, sowing, fertilizing, and covering soil are completed at one time. Two people can sow fifteen mu a day, increasing efficiency by more than three times. Due to the use of new tools in sets, since the spring plowing production, the prefecture has saved more than 40 million labor days in cultivation, transportation, processing, living, and breeding alone, which is equivalent to increasing more than 120,000 laborers, promoting finer and finer work in sowing and field management.
    In the technical innovation movement, more than 200 red flag units and thousands of pacesetters have emerged in the prefecture, cultivating a backbone force of tens of thousands of tool innovators, who have become an important force in driving the masses to carry out tool reform.

    全面革新　配套使用　以土为主　由粗到精
    黔南工具改革向系列化方向前进
    全州改革与推广新式工具五百余种，共二百余万件
    本报讯　黔南布依族苗族自治州的工具改革运动，在不断革命的思想指导下，跨入了一个新的阶段，即由零星的工具改良到系统的工具改革，由个别工序的改革，到各工种全面革新的阶段。
      在去冬今春的兴修水利运动
  中，各族人民发挥了敢想、敢说、敢干的共产主义风格，大造、大改、大力推广新式工具，实现了土机械系列化施工，大幅度地提高了劳动效率。在这一成功经验的鼓舞下，全州的工具改革运动进展十分迅速。从去年11月到今年8月，全州共改革与推广了各种新式工具五百余种、二百余万件，超过前两年总数的一倍以上。新工具的大量出现，促使工具改革运动向着系列化的方向发展。现在，农事耕作、短途运输、产品加工、生活炊事等方面，都有了新式工具或土机械。进展较快的地区，已经把各种新工具配成套。
      黔南山区道路崎岖，耕地分散，过去运输依靠肩挑背背，用于运输的劳动工日，占劳动工日总数的一半左右。大量推广使用牛马车、驮牛驮马、滑道、滑槽等新机具以后，尽管运量日益增加，用于运输的劳动工日却下降到目前的三分之一。瓮安县实行汽车跑干线，牛马车跑支线，土火车、人力车跑田间，木帆船走河道，滑丝、滑槽爬高山，基本上实现了“一条龙”定线运输，大大提高运输量，超额完成了运输任务，获得了中央交通部的红旗奖励。耕作方面占用劳力较多的插秧、脱粒和田间运输，也已大部分被先进工具所代替。全州工具改革的红旗公社——望谟县紫松公社，犁耙、播种、插秧、薅秧、锄草、追肥、抗旱、灭虫等工序都已采用新式工具，基本上实现了新式农具系列化。现在已赶制出一批收割、脱粒等新工具，为秋收新农具配套作了充分的准备。今年全州的水稻田，有40％左右是插秧机插的，80％左右是薅秧耙薅的，人们渴望已久的“插秧不弯腰，薅秧不用手脚”的日子正在逐步实现。
    在“按套制造、按套改革、按套推广”的口号下，各级党委书记亲自挂帅，大抓新式工具的配套工作，缺啥补啥，集中精力突击缺门工具。夏收中，收割、脱粒是两个落后的工序，独山县荔波公社就突击创造符合山区使用的收割机与小麦联合脱粒机，经历了十四次失败，终于制成了“独山二号畜力收割机”，获得了西南三省夏收工具改革经验交流会的好评。收割机同人畜力车、脱粒机等配成套，收割、运输、脱粒等主要工序，基本上实现了新式农具系列化，全社不仅提前半个月完成夏收任务，并节约了40％的劳动力。
    新式工具一经系列化，更加大显威风。长顺县猫营公社开始使用插秧机插秧，一般每天插二亩左右，高的达到了六亩，比手插工效提高一至五倍，后来，给每部插秧机配上一部补秧器，再给每三、五部插秧机配上一部扯秧器和洗秧器，插秧工效较手插提高了二十倍。望谟县紫松公社为玉米播种机配上施肥车，使打窝、播种、施肥、盖土等四道工序一次完成，两人一天播种十五亩，提高工效三倍以上。由于成套地使用新式工具，春耕生产以来，全州仅在耕作、运输、加工、生活和饲养等方面，就节约了四千多万个劳动日，等于增加了十二万多个劳动力，促使播种和田间管理等工作越作越细。
    全州在技术革新运动中出现了二百多个红旗单位、千余名标兵，培养了一支拥有数万人的工具革新骨干队伍，他们都成为带动群众进行工具改革的重要力量。
