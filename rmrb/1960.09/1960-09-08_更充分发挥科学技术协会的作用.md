    Give Fuller Play to the Role of the Science and Technology Association
    Currently, the technical innovation and technical revolution movement centered on "four modernizations" across the country is summarizing, consolidating, promoting, and improving, and developing towards a higher stage. In order to promote the development of this movement, the science and technology mass organization – the Science and Technology Association – should give fuller play to its role.
    The Science and Technology Association is an organization that unites scientific and technical personnel and the backbone elements of the technical revolution movement, and it is also a tool and assistant for the Party to mobilize the vast number of scientific and technical workers and the broad masses of the people to carry out the technical revolution. It carries out the popularization and improvement of science and technology, and combines popularization and improvement. For more than two years, especially since the technical innovation and technical revolution movement was launched in various regions, the Science and Technology Association's organizations at all levels have achieved great successes and accumulated valuable experiences in conducting research, experimentation, summarizing, and promoting work, vigorously engaging in science and technology popularization work, and carrying out mass theoretical research activities. The Shanghai Science and Technology Association once summarized the working experience of relying on the Party's leadership, linking up with relevant government departments, and combining the forces of workers, peasants, experts, and leading cadres to actively assist the Party, closely following the requirements of production and technical revolution. Therefore, the activities of the Science and Technology Association have become increasingly vibrant, not only enabling the widespread development of grassroots mass scientific and technological activities, but also making the activities of the learned societies more dynamic due to the promotion of the technical revolution movement.
    In the context of the whole Party and the whole people running science, various production departments carrying out technical innovation and technical revolution movements, and various research institutions and universities carrying out a large number of research activities, what kind of work can science and technology mass organizations carry out? Facts show that there is a lot of work to be done. The Science and Technology Association is an organization of grassroots technical innovation backbone elements, and also a common organization of technical innovation backbone elements from all walks of life. Moreover, it is also a common organization that concentrates experts from production, education, and research. Therefore, whether in a grassroots unit, an industry, or even in a larger area such as a district, county, or province, the Science and Technology Association has a vast field for its activities. Judging from the experiences of Shanghai and other regions, the main effective activities of the Science and Technology Association in the past two years include: organizing mass research and experimentation work around the needs of production, organizing various technical "on-site" activities combining the three aspects, and cooperating with production departments to train the backbone force of technical innovation; vigorously carrying out the popularization of scientific knowledge, introducing the latest scientific and technological achievements at home and abroad to the workers and peasants in a popular way, and at the same time, paying attention to the guidance of scientific and technological activities for young people; exchanging research and experimental results from various aspects based on the principle of combining indigenous and foreign methods, and carrying out academic activities of "letting a hundred schools of thought contend" in coordination with teaching reform, as well as carrying out relevant compilation, publication, and information exchange work. The Science and Technology Association should also organize members to actively participate in various political movements and study Mao Zedong's works to guide the correct development of scientific and technological activities and promote the ideological transformation of scientific and technical personnel. This is a regular and important task. In the first half of this year alone, the Shanghai Science and Technology Association's learned societies carried out more than 700 professional activities, and conducted research and summaries of 120 key projects in coordination with the tasks of "four modernizations", manufacturing high-quality, sophisticated, and cutting-edge products, comprehensive utilization of resources, and promotion of new technologies. One conference of the Chemical Industry Society alone was attended by more than 300 scientific and technical personnel, students, and workers, lasting for half a month, and discussing many papers on new technologies and new processes. The city's grassroots Science and Technology Associations are also very active. Yangpu District has established 1,123 mass scientific and technological research groups and 71 simplified research institutes, completing a total of 3,658 research projects. The Science and Technology Association of the Yangpu District Acid-Resistant Enamel Factory, under the unified leadership of the Party and government of the factory in the past six months, united the workers and masses to carry out innovation, broke through seven key production technologies, and summarized 140 technical materials, and also wrote works such as "Quality of Acid-Resistant Enamel Welds" and "Acid-Resistant Enamel Technology". In terms of training cadres, the Shanghai learned societies have established 18 amateur universities, and the Science and Technology Associations at all levels have also established a large number of high, middle, and primary level amateur technical schools and various training classes. The city's Science and Technology Association members have now grown to 100,000, of which 60% are technical innovation backbone elements from the working class and peasantry. All these achievements fully demonstrate that the Science and Technology Association has a great role to play in the cause of developing science and technology in our country.
    At present, the Science and Technology Association should especially focus on the following tasks: First, it should cooperate with production departments to summarize, appraise, and promote all effective technical innovation achievements, so that they can blossom and bear fruit in production and form complete sets; and for those innovation projects that are still unstable and have not yet passed the technical level, it should organize forces to solve the technical key problems, so that they can be put into production as soon as possible. At present, it is even more important to seize the organization of activities to support agricultural production. Secondly, it is necessary to seize the summary of production experience and actively carry out theoretical activities. Many achievements of technical innovation have been applied in production, but their laws and mechanisms are not yet clear, and some projects are unstable in production application due to the failure to master their laws. Therefore, it is urgently needed to strengthen theoretical research activities to overcome the state that theoretical work lags behind practice. Of course, this work should also be done by combining experts and the masses, that is, to develop theory on the basis of summarizing mass experience, and to organize the masses to participate in the summary themselves. Third, it is to rectify, consolidate and improve mass research organizations, and improve mass research groups, professional groups, study groups, laboratories, research offices, and even learned societies above the county level. So that mass research work can be continuously improved, and so that activists can be better organized. Fourth, strengthen the training of backbone elements of technical innovation. Strengthen their political and ideological education, reduce activities that hinder production, and provide better assistance in improving their technical skills, so that they can play a more effective backbone role in their work.
    In the work of organizing the summary, consolidation, promotion, and improvement of technical innovation achievements, it is necessary to strengthen the Party's ideological and political leadership. The innovation and creation of the masses are the result of breaking superstitions and emancipating the mind. If we carefully summarize them, we will discover new technical laws and create new production methods. However, without respecting the creation of the masses and respecting the revolutionary spirit of practice, we will also enter a mountain of treasures and return empty-handed. For example, when Pudong County in Shanghai summarized its experience in high vegetable yields, the masses put forward many valuable experiences, but some scientific and technical personnel's attitude towards these experiences was to copy existing books. They affirmed what was in the books and denied what was not in the books. Obviously, this can only block the growth of new things and the development of new technologies and theories. This kind of metaphysical thought that is divorced from reality should be prevented and corrected in time. Therefore, in the process of summarizing the mass technical innovation experience, arming the masses and arming scientific and technical personnel with Mao Zedong Thought is always the most reliable guarantee for promoting the rapid development of science and technology.
    The motherland is continuing to leap forward, and the technical innovation and technical revolution movement centered on "four modernizations" is advancing vigorously. The Science and Technology Association should actively carry out activities and play a greater role in the socialist construction cause of the motherland!

    更充分发挥科学技术协会的作用
    现在，全国各地以“四化”为中心的技术革新、技术革命运动，正在总结、巩固、推广、提高，向着更高的阶段发展。为了促进这一运动的发展，科学技术群众团体——科学技术协会应当更充分地发挥作用。
    科学技术协会是团结科学技术人员和技术革命运动的骨干分子的组织，也是党动员广大科学技术工作者和广大人民群众进行技术革命的工具和助手。它进行的是科学技术的普及工作和提高工作，并把普及和提高结合起来。两年多以来，特别是自各地开展技术革新、技术革命运动以来，科协的各级组织在进行研究、试验、总结、推广等工作，大搞科学技术普及工作以及开展群众性理论研究活动等方面获得了巨大的成就，取得了宝贵的经验。上海科协曾经总结了一靠、二挂、三结合，围绕中心任务，积极做好党的助手的工作经验。一靠，是依靠党的领导；二挂，是和有关的政府部门挂上钩；三结合，是组织和发动工农群众、专家和领导干部的力量，紧紧根据生产和技术革命的要求，开展工作，积极主动地做好党进行技术革命和文化革命的助手。因此科协的活动就日益具有旺盛的生命力，不仅使基层的群众性的科技活动广泛地开展起来，而且学会的活动也因技术革命运动的推动而更有生气。
    在全党全民办科学，各个生产部门都开展技术革新、技术革命运动，各种研究机构、大专学校也大量开展研究活动的情况下，科学技术群众团体可以进行哪些工作呢？事实表明，工作是很多的。科协是各个基层的技术革新骨干分子的组织，又是各行各业的技术革新骨干分子的共同组织，并且还是集中生产、教育、研究三方面各种专家的共同组织，因此无论在一个基层，一个行业，以至在区、县、省市更大的范围内，科协的活动园地都很广阔。就上海及其他各地的经验来看，两年来科协行之有效的活动，主要的有：围绕生产的需要，组织群众性的研究试验工作，组织三结合的各种技术上门的活动，并配合生产部门培训技术革新的骨干力量；大力进行科学知识的普及工作，将国内外最新的科学技术成就通俗地介绍给工农群众，同时，注意对少年科技活动的辅导工作；本着土洋结合的方针，交流各方面研究试验成果，并配合教学改革开展百家争鸣的学术活动，及进行有关的编译出版和情报交流等工作。科协还要组织会员积极参加各种政治运动，学习毛泽东著作，以指导科学技术活动的正确开展，推动科技人员的思想改造等工作。这是一项经常的重要的任务。上海市科协各学会仅在今年上半年就配合“四化”、制造高、精、尖产品、资源综合利用、推广新技术等任务，开展了七百多次专业活动，进行了一百二十个重点项目的研究总结。仅化学化工学会的一次会议就有三百多名科技人员、学生、工人参加，历时半个月，讨论了许多篇有关新技术、新工艺的论文。该市基层科协也很活跃，杨浦区已建立群众性科技研究小组一千一百二十三个，简易研究所七十一个，共完成研究项目三千六百五十八项。该区耐酸搪瓷厂科协，半年来在工厂党政统一领导之下团结职工群众一起搞革新，突破七项生产技术关键问题，总结技术资料一百四十篇，还写出“耐酸搪瓷焊道质量”“耐酸搪瓷工艺”等著作。在培训干部方面，上海市学会办了十八所业余大学，各级科协也大量举办了高、中、初级业余技术学校和各种训练班。全市科协会员现已发展到十万人，其中60％是工农成份的技术革新骨干分子。所有这些成就，都充分说明科协在我国发展科学技术的事业中是大有可为的。
      目前，科协应当特别抓紧这样几件工作：首先，要配合生产部门总结、鉴定、推广一切有效的技术革新的成果，使之在生产上开花结果，配套成龙；而对那些尚不稳定，在技术上还不能过关的革新项目，则组织力量去解决技术关键，使之尽早地投入生产。在目前更应抓紧组织支援农业生产的活动。其次，要抓紧总结生产经验，积极开展理论活动。技术革新
  的许多成果已在生产中应用，但尚不清楚其规律、机理，有些项目因未能掌握其规律，在生产应用上也不稳定。因此急需加强理论研究的活动，以克服理论工作落后于实践的状态。
  当然，这一工作也应当是专家和群众结合起来做，即要在总结群众经验的基础上发展理论，并要组织群众自己参加总结。第三，是整顿、巩固和提高群众性的研究组织，健全群众性的研究小组和专业组、学习组、试验室、研究室，以至县以上的学会组织。使群众性的研究工作能够不断提高，使积极分子能够更好地组织起
  来。第四，加强技术革新骨干分子的培养工作。加强对他们的政治思想教育，减少妨碍生产的活动，在技术业务的提高上给以更好的帮助，使在工作上能发挥更有效的骨干作用。
    在组织技术革新成果的总结、巩固、推广、提高的工作中，必须加强党
  的思想政治领导。群众的革新和创造，都是破除迷信、解放思想的结果，我们认真加以总结，就会发现新的技术规律和创造新的生产方法，但是如果没有尊重群众的创造、尊重实践的革命精神，也会身入宝山，空手而回。如上海浦东县在一次总结蔬菜丰产经验时，群众提出许多宝贵经验，有些科技人员对待这些经验的态度却是照套现成书本，书上有的就加以肯定，书上没有的就加以否定。显然，这只能是阻塞新生事物的生长和新的技术、理论的发展。这种脱离实际的形而上学的思想，应当及时防止和纠正。因此，在总结群众技术革新经验的过程中，用毛泽东思想武装群众、武装科学技术人员，始终是推动科学技术迅速发展的最可靠的保证。
    祖国正在持续跃进，以“四化”为中心的技术革新、技术革命运动正朝气蓬勃地前进，科学技术协会应当积极开展活动，在祖国的社会主义建设事业中，发挥更大的作用！
