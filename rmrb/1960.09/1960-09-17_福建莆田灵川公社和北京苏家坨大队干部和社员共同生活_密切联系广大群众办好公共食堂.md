    Cadres and Members of Lingchuan Commune in Putian, Fujian, and Sujiatuo Brigade in Beijing Live and Work Together, Closely Contacting the Masses to Run Public Canteens Well

    (By Our Newspaper) Cadres of Lingchuan Commune in Putian, Fujian, have been going deep into production team canteens, eating at the same tables with commune members, and helping canteens improve their work. This has further strengthened the relationship between the Party and the masses, making the commune's more than 200 canteens better and better, boosting the enthusiasm of commune members, and powerfully promoting production.

    Since the Great Leap Forward, cadres of Lingchuan Commune have persisted in participating in production and leading production. However, many cadres did not go deep into production team canteens to eat at the same tables with commune members. Thus, cadres were not yet fully integrated with the masses in their daily lives. In response to this situation, the commune Party committee decided in February this year to abolish the cadre canteens at the commune-level organs and brigades, requiring all cadres of the commune and cadres from higher-level organs to eat at the same tables with commune members in the production team canteens. Some small meetings held by the commune were also "hitching a ride" with local production team canteens, without setting up separate meeting meals. Whichever canteen the cadres ate in, they had to ensure that the canteen was run well. After the commune Party committee made this decision, cadres in whichever team were leading production ate in that team's canteen. Staff members of various business departments who were not assigned to teams also directly linked up with nearby production teams, going to the canteens to eat at the same tables with commune members.

    Since February, when the cadres of this commune went down to the teams and ate at the same tables with commune members, they have consistently adhered to eating according to the set quantitative standards, eating the same food as the commune members, and integrating their lives with the masses. This has further strengthened the relationship between the Party and the masses. The first secretary of the commune Party committee ate in the Zhonghe Production Team canteen. The cooks thought he was busy with work and not in good health, so they sometimes prepared some better dishes for him, but he always declined. The commune members said with emotion: Secretary Wu is a good cadre of the Party, he is our good brother, he eats whatever we eat, and there is nothing special about his life. Xie Jincan, the propaganda committee member of the commune Party committee, was eating in the Cai Ting Production Team canteen one day and found that He Ding'an, a woman in her sixties, was eating hard, dry rice. She immediately gave her a bowl of her own relatively soft, dry rice. After taking the bowl of rice, He Ding'an was so grateful that she could not speak. Afterwards, she made suggestions to the cooks, asking them to take good care of the cadres and ensure that the cadres could eat hot meals even if they returned late from labor or meetings. Cadres and commune members ate at the same table, caring for each other and showing mutual concern, which further strengthened their relationship. Many poor and lower-middle peasants took the initiative to make friends with the cadres. Since the cadres of the commune went down to the canteens and ate at the same tables with commune members, they have made more than 1,200 close friends among the poor and lower-middle peasants, with an average of more than five close friends per cadre.

    Because cadres at all levels insisted on eating at the same tables with commune members, they had a deeper understanding of the problems existing in the canteens and could promptly solve them based on the opinions of the masses, making the canteens better and better. Jiang Yuanhe, deputy secretary of the commune Party committee, has insisted on eating in the second canteen of the Kezhu Brigade since February. Over the past few months, poor and lower-middle peasant commune members have reflected more than 20 important issues related to running the canteen to him. While eating, he heard commune members complain that the canteen lacked vegetables. After further inspection, he found that the main reason was that the canteen did not have a specialized team for growing vegetables. Therefore, he led several Communist Youth League members and old farmers to establish a vegetable growing team, strengthening vegetable production. Now, commune members can eat enough of various fresh vegetables every day. In addition, he also helped the canteen set up a processing plant to process various vegetables, ensuring a constant supply of vegetables to the canteen throughout the year. After the cadres of the commune went down to the canteens and ate at the same tables with commune members, they heard various opinions and requests from the commune members and led the commune members to rectify the canteens. Now, the canteens of each team are managed by poor and lower-middle peasant commune members. Among the 851 cooks and canteen management personnel in the commune, active elements from the poor and lower-middle peasants account for 820. Before the spring plowing, nearly 100 of the 204 canteens in the commune were third-class canteens. Now, more than 80% have jumped into the ranks of first-class canteens, and are called "happiness halls" and "iron canteens" by the masses.

    After the staff members of various departments of the commune went to the production team canteens and ate at the same tables with commune members, they also further understood the opinions and requirements of the broad masses, better handled affairs according to the opinions of the masses, and did a good job in their respective departments. In the past, the medical personnel of the commune health station only carried medicine kits down to the teams to treat commune members, but the commune's health and medical work was not done well. Since February this year, they have been eating at the same tables with commune members in the canteens and found that the broad masses of commune members lacked basic hygiene knowledge. They posted various hygiene propaganda posters in the canteens to promote hygiene knowledge and trained cooks to do a good job in hygiene. Now, the hygiene work of many brigade canteens has been improved, and commune members' illnesses have been greatly reduced. In the past, the staff members of the commercial office did not understand the opinions and requirements of the masses and required commune members to "deliver goods to their door" when purchasing agricultural and sideline products. Later, they ate at the same tables with commune members in the Qingshan Brigade canteen and heard that the masses had opinions about this. Based on the requirements of the commune members, they set up a small shop and purchasing station in the canteen and entrusted the canteen general affairs officer to manage it on their behalf, which not only facilitated the commune members to purchase daily necessities and sell agricultural and sideline products, but also carried out commercial work.

    (By Our Newspaper) The Party General Branch of Sujiatuo Brigade, Yongping People's Commune, Haidian District, Beijing, in order to further improve the canteen work, went deep into the Xixiaoying canteen and ate with the commune members, obtained experience in running the canteen well, and promoted it in the whole brigade.

    The Party General Branch of Sujiatuo Brigade has always attached importance to canteen work. However, in the past, the leadership of canteen work was mostly limited to listening to reports, holding meetings, and reading written materials, and the understanding of some specific situations was not deep or thorough. In order to run the canteen better, the Party General Branch of Sujiatuo Brigade decided to abolish the brigade's canteen from April and let the cadres eat at the same tables with the commune members in the small team canteens. At the same time, they adopted the method of going deep into one point and guiding the overall situation, and went to the Xixiaoying canteen to explore experience. In the Xixiaoying canteen, in addition to eating with the commune members, the deputy secretary of the general branch, Xiao Zhenqing, the women's team leader, Wei Xiurong, and others also personally participated in the canteen management work, cooking and selling food together with the canteen managers and cooks. In this way, the team cadres not only widely listened to the commune members' opinions on the canteen, but also had a very clear understanding of the canteen's "family property."

    After the brigade cadres ate and managed together with the commune members in the Xixiaoying canteen, they learned that the canteen manager did not manage the accounts, but only reported the receipts and received things to the squadron accountant on time, and had no idea about the canteen's income and expenditure, so he could not play the role of the canteen manager. After research, they removed the squadron accountant, transferred the accounts to the canteen, and let the canteen manager specifically control the income and expenditure. At the same time, they also helped the canteen manager establish simple and easy-to-use accounts such as cash receipts and disbursements and detailed classification, so as to achieve clear settlements on a daily basis. When the brigade cadres were eating in the canteen, they personally experienced that the waiting time for getting food was long, which affected the commune members' rest, so they helped the canteen change the method of serving food, so that the commune members could get food as soon as they arrived, without waiting. The brigade cadres also helped the canteen establish a grain management system, implemented the method of "quantifying according to the number of people and eating with tickets," and changed the issuance of grain tickets from once a month to once every fifteen days, which made it easier for the commune members to calculate in stages. At the same time, the method of "reporting meals early" was implemented. Each household of commune members had a card on which the commune members wrote the amount of food for the next meal in advance and handed it to the canteen. The canteen cooked according to the amount on the card for each meal and cleared the accounts every day, made a large summary every ten days, and made calculations on a monthly basis. In addition, they also helped the canteen to experiment with and promote the double-steaming rice method, which was both satisfactory to the masses and saved grain. After the brigade cadres went deep into the canteen and ate with the commune members, they also strengthened the political and ideological education of the canteen managers and cooks. This enabled them to further realize the importance of running the canteen well, thereby loving the cooking work more and thinking about the commune members in every way, and trying their best to run the canteen well.

    After the cadres of this brigade explored the experience of running the canteen well in the Xixiaoying canteen, they immediately held an on-site meeting and promoted it in the whole brigade. Now, all 24 canteens in the brigade have implemented the grain management system of "quantifying according to the number of people and eating with tickets." The first and second canteens of Houshajian lacked management experience and had no idea how much to cook, sometimes cooking too much and sometimes cooking too little, resulting in waste. After they adopted the method of cooking according to the amount of the Xixiaoying canteen, the phenomenon of grain waste was eliminated. After the canteen of the 17th production team implemented the grain card system, it controlled the amount of grain used on that day in three stages, so as to not use the grain from the next meal for the previous meal, and not to eat the grain from tomorrow today. Through visiting and learning in the Xixiaoying canteen, the cooks of all 24 canteens in the brigade learned the double-steaming rice method, which not only increased the variety of food, but also saved grain.

    福建莆田灵川公社和北京苏家坨大队干部和社员共同生活
    密切联系广大群众办好公共食堂
    本报讯　福建莆田灵川公社干部深入生产队食堂，和社员同桌吃饭，帮助食堂改进工作，进一步密切了党和群众的关系，使全社二百多个食堂越办越好，社员干劲越鼓越足，有力地推动了生产。
    灵川公社干部自大跃进以来，坚持了参加生产领导生产。但许多干部没有深入到生产队食堂去和社员同桌吃饭。这样，干部在生活上还没有完全和群众打成一片。针对这一情况，公社党委今年2月决定撤销了公社一级机关和大队的干部食堂，要求全社干部和上级机关来的干部，都到生产队食堂和社员同桌吃饭，公社召开的一些小型会议，也是和当地生产队食堂“搭伙”，不另搞会议伙食。干部在那个食堂吃饭，就要保证办好那个食堂。公社党委作出这一决定后，全社干部在那队领导生产，就在那队食堂吃饭，没有下队的各业务部门的职工，也分别和附近生产队直接挂钩，到食堂和社员同桌吃饭。
    这个社的干部自2月份下队和社员同桌吃饭以来，一直坚持按定量标准吃饭，和社员吃同样的饭菜，生活和群众打成一片，因而进一步密切了党和群众的关系。公社党委第一书记在中何生产队食堂吃饭，炊事员认为他工作忙、身体又不大好，有时给他准备了一些好菜，但每次他都谢绝了。社员们感动地说：吴书记是党的好干部，是我们的好兄弟，我们吃什么他也吃什么，生活没有半点特殊。公社党委宣传委员谢金蝉在蔡亭生产队食堂吃饭，一天发现六十多岁的妇女何定安吃的是硬干饭，立刻把自己一碗比较软的干饭让给她吃，何定安接过这碗饭后，感激得说不出话来，事后她向炊事员提意见，要他们好好照顾干部，保证干部劳动或开会晚回来，也能吃到热饭热菜。干部和社员同桌吃饭，互相体贴，互相关怀，进一步密切了关系，许多贫农下中农主动和干部交上了知心朋友。全社干部通过下食堂和社员同桌吃饭以来，交了贫农、下中农的知心朋友一千二百多个，平均每个干部都有知心朋友五个以上。
    由于各级干部坚持和社员同桌吃饭，对食堂存在的问题了解得都比较深透，并能根据群众意见及时解决，使食堂越办越好。公社党委副书记江元和，自2月份以来坚持在柯朱大队第二食堂吃饭。几个月来，贫农下中农社员向他反映了有关办食堂的二十多个重要问题。他在吃饭中，听到社员反映食堂蔬菜不足，经过进一步检查，发现主要原因是食堂没有种菜专业队。于是他就领导几个共青团员和老农，建立了蔬菜专业队，加强了蔬菜生产。现在，社员每日可以吃到足够的各种鲜菜。另外，他还帮助食堂办起了加工厂，加工各类蔬菜，保证食堂蔬菜常年不断。全社干部下食堂，和社员同桌吃饭后，听到社员的各种意见和要求，领导社员整顿了食堂。现在各队食堂都是由贫农、下中农社员当家，全社八百五十一个炊事员和食堂管理人员中，贫农下中农的积极分子就占了八百二十个。春耕前，全社二百零四个食堂，有近百个是三类食堂，现在80％以上都跃入一类食堂行列，被群众称为“幸福堂”、“铁食堂”。
    公社各部门职工下生产队食堂和社员同桌吃饭后，也进一步了解到广大群众的意见和要求，更好地根据群众意见办事，把本部门的工作搞好。公社保健站医务人员，过去只背药箱下队为社员治病，但全社卫生保健工作却没有搞好。今年2月份以来，他们在食堂和社员同桌吃饭，发现广大社员卫生常识比较缺乏，就在食堂里张贴了各种卫生宣传画，宣传卫生常识，并训练炊事员搞好卫生。现在许多大队食堂的卫生工作都有了改进，社员疾病大大减少。商业办事处职工过去不大了解群众的意见和要求，收购农副产品要社员“送货上门”。后来他们在青山大队食堂和社员同桌吃饭后，听到群众对此有意见，便根据社员要求在食堂设立了小卖部和收购站，委托食堂总务员代为管理，既便利了社员购买日用品和出售农副产品，又开展了商业工作。
    本报讯　北京海淀区永平人民公社苏家坨大队党总支，为了进一步改进食堂工作，深入到西小营食堂和社员同吃，取得办好食堂的经验，在全大队推广。
    苏家坨大队党总支，一贯重视食堂工作。但过去对食堂工作的领导，多限于听汇报，开会，看书面材料，有些具体情况了解不深不透。为了把食堂办得更好，苏家坨大队党总支决定从4月份起撤销大队的食堂，干部到小队食堂和社员同桌吃饭。同时，采取深入一点、指导全面的办法，到西小营食堂摸索经验。大队干部在西小营食堂除了和社员同吃外，总支副书记萧振清、妇女队长魏秀荣等还亲自参加食堂管理工作，和食堂管理员、炊事员一起做饭、一起卖饭，这样，队干部不仅广泛听取了社员对食堂的意见，而且对食堂的“家底”也摸得很清楚。
    大队干部在西小营食堂和社员同吃同管理后，了解到食堂的管理员不管账，只是按时向中队会计报单据和领东西，对食堂收支心中无数，不能发挥食堂管理员的作用。经过研究后，撤掉了中队会计，账目下放到食堂，让食堂管理员具体掌握收支。同时，他们还帮助食堂管理员建立了现金出纳、明细分类等简便易行的账目，作到了顿清日结。大队干部在食堂吃饭时，亲身体会到打饭等候时间长，影响社员休息，便帮助食堂改变了打饭方法，作到社员随到随打，不用等候。大队干部还帮助食堂建立了粮食管理制度，实行了“以人定量、凭票吃饭”的办法，粮票由一月发一次改为十五天发一次，这样便于社员分段核算。同时实行“用饭早报单”的办法，每户社员有一张卡片，社员在卡片上预先写好下一顿的饭量交给食堂，食堂根据卡片，每顿按量下锅，并做到一天一清账，十天一大拢，按月作核算。另外，还帮助食堂试验推行了双蒸饭方法，群众既满意，又节省了粮食。大队干部深入食堂同社员一起吃饭后，还加强了对食堂管理员、炊事员的政治思想教育。使他们进一步认识到办好食堂的重要意义，从而更加热爱了炊事工作，处处为社员着想，千方百计办好食堂。
    这个大队的干部在西小营食堂摸索出办好食堂的经验后，立即召开现场会议，在全大队推广。现在全大队的二十四个食堂，都推行了“以人定量、凭票吃饭”的粮食管理制度。后沙涧第一、二食堂，由于缺乏管理经验，做饭心中无数，有时做多，有时做少，造成浪费。他们采用西小营食堂按量下锅的办法以后，消灭了粮食浪费现象。第十七生产小队的食堂实行用粮卡片制度后，把当日用粮分三段掌握，作到上顿不用下顿粮，今日不吃明日粮。全大队二十四个食堂的炊事人员，通过在西小营食堂参观学习，都学会了双蒸饭法，既增加了饭食花样，又节省了粮食。
