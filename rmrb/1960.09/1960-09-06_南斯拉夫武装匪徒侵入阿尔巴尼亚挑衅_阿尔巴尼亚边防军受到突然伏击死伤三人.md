Xinhua News Agency, Tirana, September 3rd: According to a report in the Albanian "People's Voice," a group of Yugoslav bandits invaded the Tropoja region of Albania on August 30th and suddenly ambushed an Albanian border patrol. Due to the bandits' numerical superiority and the suddenness of the ambush, two Albanian border guards were killed and one was seriously wounded. The bandits were forced to flee back to Yugoslav territory after being counterattacked.

On September 1st, thousands of residents of the Tropoja region held a funeral for the victims with grief and indignation. Albanian People's Army Major General Koraneci strongly condemned this shameless crime by the Yugoslav bandits at the funeral ceremony. He said that this vile act once again exposed the barbaric face of the Belgrade executioners. The actions of these mad jackals surpassed those of the Hitlerite fascist bandits. They vainly attempted to turn socialist Albania into their colony, and thus did not hesitate to resort to the most despicable and savage means. However, the Yugoslav revisionists should know that Albania already has its own masters; it has a brave and patriotic people under the leadership of the Labor Party. For sixteen years, under the leadership of the Labor Party, the Albanian people have bravely resisted and shattered all hostile conspiracies of the imperialists and their imperialist lackeys around Albania's borders.

Dirmihi, Secretary of the Tropoja District Committee of the Albanian Labor Party, said that the residents of Tropoja will forever hold a gun in one hand and a pickaxe in the other, and like these two heroic fighters, resolutely and loyally defend the border.

    南斯拉夫武装匪徒侵入阿尔巴尼亚挑衅
    阿尔巴尼亚边防军受到突然伏击死伤三人
    新华社地拉那3日电　据阿尔巴尼亚“人民之声报”报道，8月30日一批南斯拉夫匪徒侵入阿尔巴尼亚特罗波亚地区，并且突然伏击阿尔巴尼亚国境巡逻队。由于匪徒在数量上的优势和突然伏击，两名阿尔巴尼亚边防军人被打死，一名受重伤。匪徒在遭到反击后被迫窜回南斯拉夫领土。
    9月1日，特罗波亚区数千居民怀着悲愤的心情为死难者举行葬礼。阿尔巴尼亚人民军少将科拉乃奇在葬礼仪式上强烈谴责南斯拉夫匪徒的这一无耻罪行。他说，这一丑恶的行动再次揭破了贝尔格莱德刽子手们的野蛮面目。这些疯狂豺狼们的行动超过了希特勒法西斯匪徒。他们妄想把社会主义的阿尔巴尼亚变成他们的殖民地，从而不惜采取最卑鄙最野蛮的手段。但是，南斯拉夫修正主义者应该知道，阿尔巴尼亚已有了自己的主人，它有着在劳动党领导下的勇敢和爱国的人民。十六年来，阿尔巴尼亚人民在劳动党的领导下，英勇地反击和粉碎了帝国主义者和在阿尔巴尼亚国境周围的帝国主义仆从们的一切敌对阴谋。
    阿尔巴尼亚劳动党特罗波亚区党委书记迪尔米希说，特罗波亚的居民永远一手拿枪，一手拿镐，像这两位英雄的战士一样，坚决地忠诚地保卫着边境。
