The boats of Baiyangdian

　　At the southern end of the triangular region of Beijing, Tianjin, and Baoding lies a vast lake, the renowned Baiyangdian, Hebei's land of fish and rice. Within the lake are forty-nine villages, where the people cast their nets to catch fish, raise their guns to hunt birds, grow lotus roots, weave mats, and live prosperous lives.

　　In 1939, the Japanese invaders occupied this beautiful place, and the people of Baiyangdian, using wild geese feathers as their signal, formed a waterborne guerrilla force under the leadership of the Communist Party, using fishing boats and carrying hunting rifles. They grew from a small force into an armed contingent of over three hundred people. In the summer, they would ride light boats and move stealthily among the lotus ponds and reed marshes. In the winter, they would drive ice boats and speed across the frozen lake covered in snow. The boat now on display in the Anti-Japanese War Hall of the Chinese People's Revolutionary Military Museum is the command boat of the Baiyangdian Yanling (Wild Goose Feather) Team. In July 1941, the Yanling Team used this boat to intercept a Japanese devil's steamboat, killing seventeen Japanese invaders. At that time, a wounded enemy commander tried to escape by boat, but was stabbed to death by Zhao Laoqun, our fifty-eight-year-old member, with the bamboo pole used for propelling the boat. In 1942, the Japanese devils seized more than a hundred boats of reed mats from the people of Baiyangdian and transported them to Baoding. When the enemy boats reached the center of the lake, the Yanling Team issued a command from this command boat. The aquatic heroes suddenly rushed out of the reed marshes, and hand grenades rained down on the enemy. In less than ten minutes, the battle was over. All six devils escorting the boats and more than ninety puppet soldiers were annihilated, and more than a hundred boats of reed mats were recovered.

    白洋淀的船
    在京、津、保三角地区的南端有一个巨大的湖泊，这就是著名的白洋淀，河北的鱼米之乡。淀内共有四十九个村庄，人民下网捕鱼，举枪猎鸟，养藕编席，过着富足的生活。
    1939年日寇侵占了这个美丽的地方，白洋淀的人民就以雁翎为号，在共产党领导下，乘渔船、挎猎枪，成立了一支水上游击队。他们由小到大，后来发展成一支拥有三百多人的武装。夏日他们乘轻舟出没于荷塘苇林之间，冬季他们驾冰船飞奔在冰淀雪湖之上。现在陈列在中国人民革命军事博物馆抗日战争馆里的这只船，就是白洋淀雁翎队的指挥船。1941年7月雁翎队用这只船截击日本鬼子的汽船的战斗中，击毙了日寇十七名，当时有一名负伤的敌人指挥官想乘船逃走，被我五十八岁的老队员赵老群用这船上的撑船竹篙刺死。1942年日本鬼子抢了白洋淀人民的一百多船苇席运往保定，当敌人行舟至淀中心时，雁翎队从这只指挥船上发出号令，水上健儿突然冲出苇林，手榴弹像雨点般地朝敌人飞去，不到十分钟就解决战斗。押船的六个鬼子和九十多个伪军全部被歼，一百多船苇席也夺了回来。
