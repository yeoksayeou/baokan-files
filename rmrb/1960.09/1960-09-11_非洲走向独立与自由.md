    Africa, which has long suffered from the cruel rule of colonialism, is undergoing earth-shattering changes. With the vigorous development of national liberation movements, one independent country after another has emerged.
    From the 15th century onwards, Western colonial countries began to invade Africa. By the end of the 19th century, especially before the First World War in 1914, the entire African continent, with the exception of Ethiopia and Liberia, which maintained nominal independence, had been divided up by colonial countries such as Britain, France, Germany, Italy, Belgium, Portugal, and Spain.
    The African people waged a long and heroic struggle for national independence. However, until the end of the Second World War in 1945, only four countries remained independent: Ethiopia, Liberia, South Africa, and Egypt.
    After the war, especially since the Bandung Conference in 1955, the African people have become increasingly aware, and the national independence movement has risen to an unprecedented height. On the African continent, in addition to the above four countries, Libya, Sudan, Morocco, Tunisia, Ghana, Guinea, Cameroon, Togo, the Mali Federation, Madagascar, Congo, Somalia, Dahomey, Niger, Upper Volta, Ivory Coast, Chad, Central Africa, (Central) Congo, and Gabon have successively declared independence. Together with Nigeria and Mauritania, which are about to become independent, there will be a total of twenty-six independent countries in Africa by November of this year. Moreover, in North Africa, the heroic Algerian people are persisting in their national liberation war against French colonialism and have established their own provisional government. In other countries still under colonial rule, the flames of the struggle for independence are burning brighter and brighter. The African national independence movement is in a great situation of rapid progress.
    The end of colonialism is not far away! No force can stop the entire Africa from moving towards complete independence and freedom!

    非洲走向独立与自由
    长期以来遭受殖民主义残酷统治的非洲，正在经历着翻天复地的变化。随着民族解放运动的蓬勃发展，一个又一个独立国家相继出现了。
    从十五世纪起，西方殖民国家开始侵入非洲。到十九世纪末叶，特别是1914年第一次世界大战前夕，整个非洲，除埃塞俄比亚和利比里亚还保持着名义上的独立外，都被英、法、德、意、比、葡、西等殖民国家所瓜分。
    非洲人民为了争取民族独立，进行了长期的英勇的斗争。然而，直至第二次世界大战结束的1945年，独立的国家仍然只有埃塞俄比亚、利比里亚、南非和埃及等四国。
    战后，特别是自1955年万隆会议以来，非洲人民日益觉醒，民族独立运动空前高涨。在非洲大陆，除了上述四个国家外，利比亚、苏丹、摩洛哥、突尼斯、加纳、几内亚、喀麦隆、多哥、马里联邦、马尔加什、刚果、索马里、达荷美、尼日尔、上沃尔特、象牙海岸、乍得、中非、（中央）刚果、加蓬等国相继宣告独立。连同即将独立的尼日利亚和毛里塔尼亚一起，到今年11月，非洲总共将有二十六个独立国家。而且，在北非，英勇的阿尔及利亚人民正在坚持进行反对法国殖民主义的民族解放战争，并已成立了自己的临时政府。在其它仍然遭受殖民统治的国家里，争取独立的火焰也越烧越旺。非洲民族独立运动正处在一日千里的大好形势下。
    殖民主义的末日已经不远了！没有任何力量，能够挡住整个非洲走向完全的独立和自由！
