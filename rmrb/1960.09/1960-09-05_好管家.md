    Good Housekeepers
    Song Fuchen, the Party Branch Secretary, and Song Chaoli, the accountant, of the Xitai Production Team in our commune are two well-known “good housekeepers.”
    Whenever Branch Secretary Song Fuchen goes to the county for meetings, the round trip is over 150 li, and he always brings his own dry rations and walks, never spending public money on travel expenses. He is particularly good at arranging labor and increasing production. During the busy farming season, he concentrates the main workforce on agricultural production; during the spring plowing, summer weeding, and autumn harvest seasons, he always insists on transferring about 90% of the labor force to the agricultural front, which has resulted in good harvests year after year, and this year’s autumn crops are also growing very well. He is also good at finding production opportunities from various sources. Last year, he organized commune members to go to the mountains to chop firewood, burn charcoal, and dig medicinal herbs during slack farming seasons, earning more than 10,000 yuan; in the first half of this year, he further increased income by more than 5,500 yuan. The team has nine donkeys, which are used to carry manure and plow the fields during busy farming seasons; during slack seasons, they are used for short-distance transportation, earning an average of 500 to 600 yuan per month.
    Accountant Song Chaoli pays special attention to saving expenses. If the office building is damaged, he repairs it himself; office paper is used as much as possible. Under the influence of the branch secretary and the accountant, non-productive expenditures of the whole team have decreased year by year, a decrease of 21% last year compared to 1958, and a decrease of 15% in the first half of this year compared to the same period last year.

    好管家
    我们公社西台生产队党支部书记宋福臣、会计宋朝利，是两个有名的“好管家”。
    支部书记宋福臣去县里开会，往返一百五十多里，都是自带干粮，步行，从来不花盘费。他特别善于安排劳动力，增加生产。农忙时，就集中主力从事农业生产；春耕、夏锄、秋收的季节里，他总坚持把90％左右的劳力，调到农业战线上去，连年因此获得了好收成，今年的秋庄稼也长得很好。他还善于从多方面找生产门路，去年，组织社员利用农闲时间上山砍柴、烧炭、挖药材，收入一万多元；今年上半年又增加收入五千五百多元。全队有九头毛驴，农忙时驮粪、耕地；农闲时就搞短途运输，平均每月收入五、六百元。
    会计宋朝利，特别注意节约开支。办公室的房子坏了，他自己动手修理；办公用的纸张，都尽量用废旧纸。在支部书记和会计的影响下，全队非生产性开支逐年减少，去年比1958年减少21％，今年上半年比去年同期减少15％。
