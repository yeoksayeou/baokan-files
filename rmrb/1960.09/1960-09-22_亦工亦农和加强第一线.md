　　Part-time Work in Factories and on Farms and Strengthening the Front Lines

　　Xinhua Commune resolutely implements the policy of taking agriculture as the foundation, comprehensively rectifies the commune's industry, and transfers more than 650 people from the industrial system to strengthen the agricultural front, accounting for 51% of the commune's industrial labor force. At the same time, commune-run industries have further improved labor organization and carried out technological innovations, achieving both a reduction in personnel and an increase in production.

　　After communization, the emergence of the first batch of new-type laborers who are both workers and farmers in our country's rural areas is indeed a great joy. One or two years ago, they adapted to the needs of the time, transferring from agricultural posts to industrial posts, and making diligent efforts to create commune-run industries. Now, on the basis of innovating technology and improving work efficiency, they are saving a portion of the people to invest in agricultural production, becoming a vital force in strengthening the agricultural front. If every rural commune, like Xinhua Commune, transfers more than 600 people from commune-run industries to participate in agricultural production, there will be millions or even tens of millions of strong laborers strengthening the agricultural front nationwide, which will have a great impact on striving for victory in this year's agricultural production and for even greater harvests next year.

　　Cultivating a group of laborers who are both workers and farmers is a good method for rationally using rural labor. According to the principle of part-time work in factories and on farms, whether now or in the future, there will be some people who sometimes farm and sometimes work. Agricultural production has a strong seasonal nature, and field labor is divided into busy and slack seasons. Most industries and sidelines in the commune have peak and off-seasons. In order to adapt to this actual situation, the labor allocation between agriculture and industry, and between agriculture and forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries in the commune must be flexible; however, it must first obey the needs of agricultural production. Farming when busy with agriculture, working when agriculture is slack, and part-time work in factories and on farms can overcome the uneven distribution of labor between industry and agriculture, which is beneficial to the development of both agriculture and industry.

　　Flexible labor adjustments should not only be carried out between agriculture and industry, but also between all labor departments of the commune. Forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries should also resolutely implement the policy of taking agriculture as the foundation, first meet the needs of agricultural production, and also take into account the development of various industries. In a certain period, they are also part-time workers in forestry and farming, part-time workers in animal husbandry and farming, part-time workers in sideline occupations and farming, and part-time workers in fishing and farming. This is the great superiority shown by the commune, an all-encompassing social organization, in using social labor. Doing so does not violate the principle of the division of labor. Because part-time work in factories and on farms, part-time work in forestry and farming, ... does not exclude specialization. They mainly engage in their own specialty during the slack season of agriculture. If used reasonably and cultivated carefully, they can become all-rounders with multiple skills. Commune-run industries directly serve agriculture. A group of people who understand agricultural production knowledge participate in commune-run industrial production in certain seasons, which can promote commune-run industries to better serve agricultural production. Conversely, with the development of agricultural technological transformation, the distance between agriculture and industry is gradually narrowing. A group of people who understand industrial technology participate in agricultural production during the busy agricultural season, which is conducive to the creation of new tools and the repair of agricultural machinery.

　　In order to implement the policy of the whole party and the whole people running agriculture in a big way and running grain in a big way, whether it is commune-run industry, or forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries, they should all take agriculture as the center and arrange their work around agriculture. Which must maintain year-round production, which must be combined with the agricultural production season, running in a big way when agriculture is slack, running less when agriculture is busy, and not running at all when it is particularly busy, all must be arranged reasonably, and try to transfer more labor to strengthen the front line of agricultural production.

　　亦工亦农和加强第一线
　　程浦
    新华公社坚决贯彻以农业为基础的方针，全面整顿公社工业，从工业系统中调出六百五十多人加强农业战线，占公社工业劳动力的51％。同时，社办工业由于进一步改善劳动组织，开展技术革新，实现了减人又增产。
    公社化以后，我国农村中出现了第一批亦工亦农的新型劳动者，实在是一件大喜事。一两年前，他们适应当时的需要，从农业岗位上转到工业岗位上，为开创公社工业付出辛勤的劳动。现在，他们在革新技术，提高工效的基础上，节省出一部分人投入农业生产，成为增强农业战线的生力军。如果每个农村公社都像新华公社那样，从社办工业中调出六百多人参加农业生产，全国就有几百万甚至上千万的精壮劳力加强农业战线，这对争取今年农业生产的胜利，对于争取明年更大的丰收，必将发生极大的作用。
    培养一批亦工亦农的劳动者，是合理使用农村劳动力的一个好方法。按照亦工亦农的原则，无论现在和将来，都会有一些人，有时务农，有时做工。农业生产有强烈的季节性，田间劳动有忙、闲之分，公社中多数工业、副业有旺季、淡季之别。为了适应这种实际情况，公社的农业和工业之间、农业和林牧副渔各业之间的劳力分配，必须机动灵活；但是，首先要服从农业生产的需要。农忙务农，农闲做工，亦工亦农，可以克服工农业间劳动力忙闲不均的现象，对于农业和工业的发展都有好处。
    灵活调剂劳力，不仅应该行于农业和工业之间，而且应当行于公社的一切劳动部门之间。林、牧、副、渔各业，也应该坚决贯彻以农业为基础的方针，首先满足农业生产的需要，同时兼顾各业的发展，他们在一定时期，也是亦林亦农、亦牧亦农、亦副亦农、亦渔亦农。这是公社这个无所不包的社会组织在运用社会劳动力方面显示的极大优越性。这样做，并不违背劳动分工的原则。因为亦工亦农、亦林亦农，……并不排斥专业，他们在农闲的时候主要是搞自己的专业，如果合理使用，注意培养，就可以成为一技多能的“多面手”。社办工业是直接为农业服务的，有一批懂得农业生产知识的人在一定季节参加社办工业生产，可以促进社办工业更好地为农业生产服务；反过来，随着农业技术改造的发展，农业和工业的距离逐渐缩小，有一批懂得工业技术的人在农忙季节参加农业生产，有利于新工具的创制和农业机械的修理。
    为了贯彻全党全民大办农业、大办粮食的方针，不论社办工业，或是林、牧、副、渔各业，都应当以农业为中心，围绕农业安排自己的工作。哪些必须维持常年生产，哪些必须跟农业生产季节相结合，农闲大办，农忙少办，特忙不办，都要合理安排，尽量抽调更多的劳动力加强农业生产第一线。
