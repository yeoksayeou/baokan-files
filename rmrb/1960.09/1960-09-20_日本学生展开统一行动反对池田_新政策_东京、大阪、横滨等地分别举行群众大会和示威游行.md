Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 19th: The All-Japan Federation of Student Associations today launched a nationwide unified student action to oppose the government's unreasonable suppression of active participants in the struggle against the "Security Treaty," to oppose the Ikeda Cabinet's announced "new policies," and to demand revision of the current unreasonable election law.

This student organization held mass rallies and demonstrations in nine locations, including Tokyo, Osaka, Yokohama, and Sapporo.

Approximately one hundred representatives from eight student associations held a gathering in Tokyo, followed by a demonstration in front of the Japanese Prime Minister's official residence and the Ministry of Education.

Student associations belonging to the All-Japan Federation of Student Associations have been conducting a signature collection campaign in all major cities since the 9th of this month, demanding revision of the election law. They are demanding an increase in the number of seats in the House of Representatives for some large electoral districts, as the population of these districts has greatly increased since the election law was drafted.
