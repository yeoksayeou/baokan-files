At the initiative of the Finnish President, the two sides exchanged detailed views on economic and trade relations between the two countries.

Negotiations will be held in Moscow in the second half of November. To this end, Khrushchev has invited Kekkonen to visit the Soviet Union, and the invitation has been accepted.
