The magnetic separation workshop of the sintering plant of Anshan Iron and Steel Company has raised the red flag for improving the equipment operation rate of the ore dressing system.

Ore dressing is an important link in the production of raw materials for pig iron. The ore required by the blast furnace, except for natural rich ore, is mostly processed through ore dressing to improve its grade and become artificial rich ore before being sent to the blast furnace for ironmaking. Therefore, to ensure the sustained high production of iron and steel, not only mining must come first, but ore dressing must also come first.

Now, the campaign to increase production and practice economy, centered on grain and steel, has been carried out vigorously on all fronts. Many comrades in the ore dressing departments have set combat goals for themselves: Wherever the blast furnace leaps forward, the ore dressing will follow. To whatever level the pig iron production is increased, the concentrate production will also be increased to the same level. Only allow the concentrate to be surplus, and do not allow the blast furnace to wait for materials.

The campaign to increase production and practice economy requires that this goal must be achieved, and the realistic conditions also make it entirely possible to achieve this goal. The reason is that there is still huge potential hidden in the existing concentrators, first of all the potential of the equipment. Modern concentrators are almost entirely produced by machines. The amount of output depends on the equipment operation rate. If the machine runs for a long time, has fewer failures, and is repaired quickly, more concentrate will be produced. At present, the equipment operation rates of various ore dressing units vary greatly, and some backward units are even 20% or 30% lower than advanced units. Therefore, raising the backward level to the advanced level in the ore dressing system can tap huge potential. According to the situation in Anshan Iron and Steel, if all the ore dressing units in Anshan Iron and Steel reach or approach the level of advanced units, the concentrate output of Anshan Iron and Steel can ensure that pig iron production increases by about 10% on the existing level. It can be seen that improving the equipment operation rate is of great significance.

How to improve the equipment operation rate? The experience of the magnetic separation workshop of the sintering plant of Anshan Iron and Steel Company tells us: It is necessary to always maintain the "health" of the machine, work more, "rest less", not to repair the equipment after it is broken, not to rely only on external conditions, rely on the machine repair department to supply as many spare parts as possible, but to prevent problems before they occur, and not let them fail in the first place. In this way, we can take the initiative and extend the "effective working time" of the machine. There is no shortcut to do this. It depends only on careful maintenance every day and every hour, careful listening and careful inspection with highly concentrated attention every minute and every second, and ordinary and trivial labor year after year. The advanced experience of the comrades in the magnetic separation workshop of the sintering plant of Anshan Iron and Steel Company in increasing concentrate production in the ore dressing system is also a valuable asset for all enterprises in the country. It tells everyone how to cherish their weapons and how to create great achievements in ordinary labor.

### 平凡的劳动

　　平凡的劳动
    鞍钢烧结总厂磁选车间树起了选矿系统提高设备作业率的红旗。
    选矿是生铁原料生产中的重要环节。高炉需用的矿石除天然富矿以外，绝大部分的矿石，要经过选矿，提高品位，变成人造富矿，才能送进高炉去炼铁。因此，保证钢铁持续高产，不仅采矿要先行，选矿也要先行。
    现在，以粮、钢为中心的增产节约运动已经在各个战线上轰轰烈烈地开展了，许多选矿部门的同志给自己提出了战斗目标：高炉跃进到那里，选矿就跟到那里。生铁产量提高到什么水平，精矿产量也提高到什么水平。只许精矿有余，不叫高炉待料。
    增产节约运动要求必须实现这个目标，现实条件也完全有可能实现这个目标。原因是：在现有的选矿厂里，还蕴藏着巨大的潜力，首先是设备的潜力。现代化的选矿厂，几乎全部是用机器生产的。产量的多少，决定于设备的作业率。机器开动的时间长，故障少，检修快，精矿就生产得多。目前各个选矿单位的设备作业率相差很远，有些落后的单位甚至比先进的单位要低20％、30％。因此，在选矿系统中把落后的水平提高到先进水平，就可以挖掘出巨大的潜力来。根据鞍钢情况，如果鞍钢所有的选矿单位都达到或接近先进单位的水平，鞍钢的精矿产量就可以保证生铁在现有的水平上增产10％左右。可见提高设备作业率的意义是很大的。
    怎样提高设备作业率呢？鞍钢烧结总厂磁选车间的经验告诉我们：要经常保持机器的“健康”，多干活，“少休息”，不能让设备坏了再修，不能只依靠外部条件，依靠机修部门供应多多益善的备品，而是要防患于未然，事先就不叫它发生故障。这样就掌握了主动，延长了机器的
  “有效劳动时间”。要做到这一点，是没有什么捷径可走的。只有靠每一天、每一小时精心的维护，靠每一分、每一秒钟都集中高度的注意力仔细地听、仔细地查，靠常年如一日的平凡而琐细的劳动。鞍钢烧结总厂磁选车间的同志们在选矿系统中提供的增产精矿的先进经验，也是全国所有企业的宝贵财富，它告诉大家应该怎样爱护自己的武器，怎样在平凡的劳动中创造伟大的功绩。
