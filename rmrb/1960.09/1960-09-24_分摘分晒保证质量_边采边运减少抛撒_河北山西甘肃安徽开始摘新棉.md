　　Comprehensive reports from our newspaper indicate that people's communes in the cotton-producing areas of Hebei, Shanxi, Gansu, and Anhui are organizing forces to actively harvest new cotton.

　　In Hebei Province's Handan area, over 100,000 people have been mobilized daily in recent days to pick and transport cotton, averaging 3 million jin of seed cotton picked daily. Yongnian County has divided its efforts into three fronts: autumn harvesting, wheat planting, and cotton picking and selling. The labor force engaged in picking and transporting cotton accounts for 20% to 30% of the total labor force. Over 70% of the county's more than 500,000 mu of mature cotton has been picked once. Production teams have widely promoted "double bags" (each person using two cotton-picking bags for separating good and inferior cotton), "double picking" (picking good cotton first, then inferior cotton), and "three-two-one" (three people picking good cotton first, then two people picking inferior cotton, and finally one person picking up fallen cotton and unopened bolls) methods to ensure that good cotton is not downgraded.

　　Since late August, the Jinan area of Shanxi Province, a major cotton-producing area, has harvested more than 4.9 million jin of new cotton. Cotton farmers in the Jinzhong area are also actively harvesting new cotton under the slogan of "harvesting more cotton, harvesting good cotton, and not letting wind or rain damage a single boll."

　　Wanrong County has widely promoted the advanced cotton-picking experience of "double picking, double bags." By September 15th, more than 1.3 million jin of new cotton had been harvested from the county's more than 210,000 mu of mature cotton. In order to ensure careful and meticulous harvesting, the Xiliang Management Area of the Chengguan People's Commune in Yicheng County, led by national agricultural labor model and cotton-growing expert Wu Chun'an, implemented picking and sorting simultaneously, picking first and then sorting, and inspecting each plant, branch, boll, and petal to ensure that no "eyelashes" were left during picking. In transportation, pockets and sacks were used to ensure that the ground and roads were clean, and no cotton was lost.

　　In the Hexi Corridor and central and southern regions of Gansu, the summer cotton bolls are generally opening. People's communes in cotton-producing areas have made early arrangements for labor to ensure timely harvesting. The communes in Dunhuang and Jingyuan counties have rationally allocated more than 8,000 laborers for cotton picking, adjusted labor quotas, organized specialized groups, and implemented simultaneous picking, transportation, and warehousing to reduce waste. Zhang Yingbing, the party branch secretary of the Sanhe Production Team of the Dongwan Commune in Jingyuan County, and the seven party branch secretaries formed a cotton-picking command group, dividing up responsibilities and going deep into the front line of production. They participated in cotton picking, inspected in a timely manner, and solved problems promptly, greatly stimulating the enthusiasm of the commune members, improving cotton-picking efficiency, and ensuring the quality of cotton harvested.

　　In Anhui Province's cotton-producing areas, people's communes have universally organized professional teams based on the characteristics of concentrated and contiguous cotton fields in the people's communes, adopting the method of centralized picking, centralized sunning, and centralized selling, achieving the goal of harvesting as it ripens, meticulous harvesting, and storing the cotton in warehouses. The cotton-picking professional teams of the people's communes in the Wuhu area have adopted the method of dividing up responsibilities to ensure timely picking, timely sunning, and timely selling. Dangshan County, one of the province's major cotton-producing counties, has also concentrated its labor force to carry out a concentrated assault on cotton picking, taking into account the characteristics of this year's large cotton area, good growth, and early maturity, to ensure that each batch is harvested as it matures, harvested quickly and meticulously.

　　While meticulously harvesting new cotton, cotton-growing areas throughout the province have also generally taken measures such as removing old leaves, pruning empty fruit branches, and picking ineffective flower buds to reduce shading in cotton fields, promote the development of more autumn bolls and larger bolls, and strive to increase cotton production further.

　　河北山西甘肃安徽开始摘新棉
    本报综合报道　河北山西甘肃安徽各棉产区人民公社，正组织力量积极收摘新棉。
    河北省邯郸地区近几天来，每天出动十万多人摘运棉花，平均日摘籽棉三百万斤。永年县划分了秋收、种麦、摘售棉花三条战线，参加摘棉运棉的劳力，占总劳力的20％到30％，全县已经成熟的五十多万亩棉花，有70％已普摘了一遍。各生产队普遍推广了“双兜”（每人用两个摘棉兜，好次棉分装）、“双遍”（第一遍光摘好花，第二遍摘次花）和“三二一”（先由三个人专摘好花，再由两人摘次花，最后一人拣落地棉和僵瓣棉）等摘棉法，保证了好棉不降级。
    山西省主要产棉区晋南专区从8月下旬以来，已经采摘新棉四百九十多万斤。晋中专区棉农们也在“多收棉收好棉，不让风吹雨淋一朵一絮”的口号下，积极抢摘新棉。
    万荣县普遍推行“双遍、双兜”的先进摘棉经验，到9月15日，全县已经成熟的二十一万多亩棉花，已经摘回新棉一百三十多万斤。全国农业劳动模范植棉能手吴春安领导的翼城县城关人民公社西梁管理区为了保证精收细摘，实行了边摘边拣，先摘后拣，逐株、逐枝、逐桃、逐瓣检查，作到了摘花不留“眼睫毛”。在拉运中，又用口袋、麻袋装运，作到了地净路净，不丢一絮。
    甘肃河西走廊和中、南部地区的棉花，夏桃普遍吐絮，各产棉公社都及早安排了劳力，保证及时采摘。敦煌、靖远两县各公社，将投入摘棉的八千多名劳动力，进行合理搭配，调整劳动定额，组织专业小组，边采、边运、边入库，减少了抛撒损失。靖远县东湾公社三合生产队党总支书记张映昺和七个党支部书记组成采棉指挥小组，划片包干，深入生产第一线，一方面参加采棉，一方面及时检查，发现问题及时解决，大大激发了社员的干劲，提高了采棉效率，保证了收花质量。
    安徽省产棉区的各公社在采摘新棉中，都根据人民公社棉田集中成片的特点，普遍组织专业队，采取集中采、集中晒、集中出售的办法，达到了边熟边收，精细收摘朵絮归仓的要求。芜湖专区各棉区人民公社的采棉专业队都采用划片包干的办法，作到了及时采摘及时晾晒及时出售。全省主要产棉县之一的砀山县，还针对今年棉花面积大、生长好、成熟早的特点，集中劳力突击采摘，做到了熟一批收一批，收得快收得细。
    全省棉区在精细采摘新棉的同时，还普遍采取去老叶、剪空果枝、摘无效花蕾等措施，以减少棉田荫蔽，促使多结秋桃，结大桃，力争增产更多的棉花。
