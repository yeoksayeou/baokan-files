Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, September 7th: The Third National Congress of the Vietnamese Labor Party entered its third day today.

Nguyễn Duy Trinh, member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Vietnamese Labor Party, Deputy Prime Minister, and Director of the State Planning Commission, delivered a supplementary report at the morning session on the tasks and directions of the first Five-Year Plan (1961-1965) for the development of the national economy. Subsequently, Lê Thanh Nghị, member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Vietnamese Labor Party, spoke on the party's industrialization policy and the priority development of heavy industry in the first Five-Year Plan.

At the afternoon session, Phạm Hùng, member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Vietnamese Labor Party and Deputy Prime Minister, spoke on agricultural issues. Chu Văn Tấn, member of the Central Committee of the Vietnamese Labor Party and Director of the Ethnic Affairs Commission, and Hoàng Quốc Thịnh, Deputy Minister of Commerce, spoke on ethnic issues and food issues, respectively. Representatives from Thanh Hóa Province and Hải Dương Province also spoke at the meeting.

At the morning session, the secretariat of the congress also read out congratulatory messages from fraternal parties, including those from the Algerian Communist Party, the Ceylon Communist Party, the Austrian Communist Party, the Australian Communist Party, and the Israeli Communist Party. These congratulatory messages were warmly welcomed by the congress when they were read out. According to the Vietnam News Agency, Nguyễn Duy Trinh said in his supplementary report on the tasks and directions of the first Five-Year Plan for the development of the national economy, "In the North, the socialist revolution has only been carried out for six years, which is just a short stage in our long march towards socialism and communism. We have achieved preliminary, but very important, victories."

He pointed out that these victories lie in the fact that the various sectors of the economy and culture have begun to develop at a high speed; socialism is gradually gaining a dominant position in the North.

He said that North Vietnam originally had extremely low agricultural yields. Now, the grain yield per hectare and per capita is among the highest in Southeast Asian countries (in 1959, the per capita rice yield was 334 kilograms). By the end of this year, the total output value of state-owned industries will be more than double that of 1957. Compared with six years ago, electricity is 3.8 times higher, coal 2.8 times higher, cement 3.5 times higher, timber two times higher, phosphate more than six times higher, and cotton fabrics more than 8.5 times higher. The industry in North Vietnam used to be mainly for extraction and preliminary processing. Today, it has many enterprises producing major necessities. The industry in North Vietnam is now able to supply necessary means of production and a large part of consumer goods.

He said that the material life of the people has also gradually improved significantly. Socialist transformation has achieved a decisive victory. By the end of 1960, farmers participating in agricultural cooperatives will account for 70%-75% of all farmers. All private enterprises in the industrial and commercial sectors, cultural and artistic undertakings, and transportation industries will be transformed into joint state-private enterprises or cooperative enterprises.

Nguyễn Duy Trinh then said, "During the first Five-Year Plan period, after achieving basic victory in socialist transformation, we must shift to socialist construction as the central task, realize preliminary socialist industrialization, lay a preliminary material and technical foundation for socialism, and at the same time complete socialist transformation and transform our economy into a single socialist economy."

After elaborating on the basic tasks of the first Five-Year Plan, Nguyễn Duy Trinh put forward the main control figures as the basis for formulating the first Five-Year Plan. He said that by 1965, the total output value of industrial and handicraft products will increase by 1.5 times compared with 1960, with an average annual increase of 20%, of which Category I will increase by 25.8% and Category II will increase by 16%. By 1965, the total output value of agricultural products is expected to increase by 61% compared with 1960, with an average annual increase of 10%.

He said that by 1965, industrial and handicraft products will account for about 51% of the total value of industrial and agricultural products, and agricultural products will account for about 49%.

He said that the state's total investment in basic economic and cultural construction will account for about 48% of budgetary expenditure, an increase of 1.5 times compared with the past five years. 82% of the total investment will be used for production sectors. He said that in terms of labor productivity, it will increase by an average of 9% per year in state-owned industries and 6% in basic construction. In terms of education and training of cadres, the number of students in ordinary schools will reach 3.5 million in 1965, double that of 1960. The number of students receiving secondary specialized education will be 85,000, an increase of 1.5 times, and the number of university students will be 40,000, an increase of more than two times. In five years, nearly 25,000 cadres will graduate from universities, and another nearly 100,000 will graduate from secondary specialized schools.

He said that on the basis of developing production and improving labor productivity, the average real income of workers and peasants will increase by about 30% in 1965 compared with 1960.

When talking about the specific indicators of the economic and cultural sectors, he said that in the industrial sector, by 1965, the total power generation will increase by 2.8 times compared with 1960; the output of steel plates will be 160,000 tons; the output of the machine-building sector will increase by four times compared with 1960; and the coal mining volume will be 4.2 million tons, an increase of 71.4% compared with 1960.

He said that in the agricultural sector, by 1965, the expected grain output will reach 9 million tons (converted to rice), with an average of 470 kilograms per person. The rice output will reach 7 million tons. The area of land for planting cash crops will be expanded by 1.5 times. In addition to the existing state-owned farms, another twenty-five state-owned farms will be built.

He said that in the postal and transportation sectors, efforts will be concentrated on widening the gauge of the Yên Viên-Mục Nam Quan railway and the Đông Anh-Thái Nguyên railway to 1.435 meters, and extending the Hanoi-Thanh Hóa railway line to Nghi An.

He said that in the cultural, educational, and public health fields, according to the Five-Year Plan, North Vietnam will have fifteen universities and colleges accommodating 40,000 university students and seventy-six secondary specialized schools accommodating 85,000 students. During this period, the number of trained technical workers will reach 200,000. At the same time, leading cadres at all levels will receive in-service education of varying degrees.

He said that by 1965, the number of books published will increase by 1.5 times compared with 1960. Hospitals will increase from sixty-five to one hundred and six, and affiliated hospital clinics will increase from one hundred and eighty-one to two hundred and ninety-five, with hospital beds increasing from twenty-one thousand seven hundred and five to thirty thousand. Each village will have a privately-run affiliated hospital, which will have more than 50,000 beds.

When talking about improving the people's lives, he said that the income of most agricultural cooperative members will reach and exceed the current income of upper-middle peasants. The income of handicraftsmen and small vendors will also continue to increase. The wages of workers, civil servants, cadres, etc., will also continue to increase, and the wage system must be further improved. At the same time, we must attach importance to developing material and cultural welfare and expanding social funds.

He then put forward five main guidelines that must be followed in the specific formulation of the Five-Year Plan. These guidelines are: first, laying a preliminary material and technical foundation for socialism must be closely combined with completing socialist transformation. Of these two tasks, the former is the most decisive link in guiding the socialist revolution forward, while completing socialist transformation is a very important task. Second, develop industry and agriculture simultaneously, give priority to the development of heavy industry, and strive to fully develop agriculture and light industry at the same time. Third, rationally distribute the productive forces of the plains and mountainous areas in order to eliminate the current imbalance in the distribution of productive forces between various regions and between industry and agriculture. Fourth, promote the spirit of diligence and thrift in national construction, and correctly solve the relationship between accumulation and consumption. Attention should be paid to increasing accumulation to meet the needs of developing production. At the same time, on the basis of developing production, we should attach great importance to gradually improving the living standards of the people. Fifth, strengthen international cooperation with other countries in the socialist camp.

In the final part of the report, Nguyễn Duy Trinh talked about strengthening the planning and leadership of the national economy and implementing the plan.

He said that after the completion of the first Five-Year Plan, the two forms of socialist relations of production, namely ownership by the whole people and collective ownership, will occupy an absolutely dominant position in the national economy. The technical foundation of agriculture, transportation, and especially industry, will be initially laid; the number of cadres and skilled workers in economic construction will increase, and their quality will also be improved to a certain extent; the patriotic emulation movement of the masses will become more extensive and more vigorous.

He said that in the agricultural sector, cooperatives will gradually incorporate the originally dispersed small-scale production into increasingly large-scale organizations. At the same time, the grain problem will be firmly solved, and diversified economic development will be promoted, especially the increase in the number of industrial crops and livestock, so as to create favorable conditions for socialist industrialization.

He said that in the industrial sector, after the Five-Year Plan, North Vietnam will build more than a dozen industrial zones, including the more concentrated industrial areas such as Hanoi, Thai Nguyen, Việt Trì, Haiphong, and Hong Gai. In the mountainous areas, the construction of several important industrial bases has already begun. The main sectors of heavy and light industry will be built into an increasingly balanced development system, so as to be able to meet most of the needs in steel and chemical fertilizers, meet a part of the needs in equipment, and meet almost all the needs of the working people's consumer goods.

He said that with the development of the economy, on the basis of the increasing volume of production, the material and cultural life of the working people will be significantly further improved.

Nguyễn Duy Trinh concluded by saying: "Our prospects are very good. We must do everything possible to turn possibilities into reality. Under the leadership of the Central Committee, according to the resolutions of the Congress, with the wholehearted assistance of fraternal countries, coupled with the tradition of heroic struggle and hard work of our people, our people will surely be able to successfully complete the various tasks of the first Five-Year Plan, so that the North can steadily advance on the road of socialist construction and consolidate the North and make it a strong base for the struggle for the reunification of the motherland."

    阮维祯在越南劳动党代表大会上作报告
    越南人民定能胜利完成五年计划
    在第一个五年计划期间，社会主义改造取得基本胜利之后，必须转而以社会主义建设为中心任务，实现初步的社会主义工业化，为社会主义奠定初步的物质和技术基础，同时完成社会主义改造，把经济改造成为单一的社会主义经济。
    新华社河内7日电　越南劳动党第三次全国代表大会今天进入第三天。
    越南劳动党中央政治局委员、副总理兼国家计划委员会主任阮维祯在上午会议上作了关于发展国民经济的第一个五年计划（1961年—1965年）的任务和方向的补充报告。接着，越南劳动党中央政治局委员黎清毅就有关党的工业化政策和第一个五年计划中优先发展重工业的问题作了发言。
    在下午的会议上，越南劳动党中央政治局委员、副总理范雄作了关于农业问题的发言。越南劳动党中央委员、民族事务委员会主任朱文晋和商业部副部长黄国盛分别就民族问题和粮食问题发了言。清化省、海阳省各个代表也在会上相继发言。
    在上午的会议上，大会秘书处还宣读了一些兄弟党的贺电，其中有阿尔及利亚共产党、锡兰共产党、奥地利共产党、澳大利亚共产党、以色列共产党的贺电。这些贺电在宣读时受到大会热烈的欢迎。据越南通讯社报道，阮维祯在他所作的关于发展国民经济的第一个五年计划的任务和方向的补充报告中说，“在北方，社会主义革命才进行了六年，这不过是我们走向社会主义和共产主义的长途进军中的一个短短的阶段。我们已取得了初步的、然而是非常重要的胜利”。
    他指出，这些胜利在于，经济和文化的各个部门开始高速度地发展；社会主义在北方正逐渐取得占优势的地位。
    他说，越南北方原来农业产量极低，现在不论每公顷还是按人口平均的粮食产量都已居东南亚国家的首位（1959年按人口平均计算的稻谷产量为三百三十四公斤）。到今年年底为止，国营工业的总产值将为1957年的一倍以上。与六年前比较，电力为三点八倍，煤为二点八倍，水泥为三点五倍，木材为两倍，磷酸盐为六倍以上，棉织品为八点五倍以上。越南北方的工业过去主要是开采和初步加工性质，今天在生产主要的必需品方面拥有了许多企业。越南北方的工业现在能够供应必要的生产资料和很大部分的消费品。
    他说，人民的物质生活也逐渐有了显著的改善。社会主义改造已取得决定性的胜利。到1960年底，参加农业合作社的农户将占全部农户的70％—75％。在工商业各部门、文化艺术事业和运输业的一切私营企业都将改造成为公私合营企业或合作企业。
    阮维祯接着说，“在第一个五年计划期间，社会主义改造取得基本胜利之后，我们必须转而以社会主义建设为中心任务，实现初步的社会主义工业化，为社会主义奠定初步的物质和技术基础，同时完成社会主义改造，把我国经济改造成为单一的社会主义经济。”
    阮维祯在阐述了第一个五年计划的基本任务后提出了主要控制数字作为制订第一个五年计划的基础。他说，到1965年，工业和手工业产品的总产值将比1960年增加一倍半，平均每年增加20％，其中第一部类增加25.8％，第二部类增加16％。到1965年，农产品的总产值比1960年预计可增长61％，平均每年增加10％。
    他说，到1965年，在工农业产品的总值中，工业和手工业产品的比重约占51％，农产品约占49％。
    他说，国家在经济和文化的基本建设方面的总投资约为预算支出的48％，比过去五年的投资增加一倍半。总投资的82％将用于生产部门。他说，在劳动生产率方面，在国营工业中平均每年将增长9％，在基本建设中将增长6％。在教育和训练干部方面，1965年普通学校的学生人数将达到三百五十万，为1960年的两倍。受中等专业教育的学生人数为八万五千人，增加一倍半，大学生人数为四万人，增加两倍多。在五年里，将有近二万五千名干部从大学毕业，另外有将近十万名从中等专业学校毕业。
    他说，在发展生产和提高劳动生产率的基础上，1965年工人和农民的平均实际收入将比1960年提高30％左右。
    他在谈到经济和文化部门的具体指标时说，在工业方面，到1965年，总的发电量将比1960年增加二点八倍；钢板的产量将为十六万吨；机器制造部门的产量将比1960年增加四倍；采煤量将为四百二十万吨，比1960年增加71.4％。
    他说，在农业方面，到1965年，预计粮食的产量将达九百万吨（折算为稻谷），每人平均有四百七十公斤。而稻谷的产量将达七百万吨。种植经济作物的土地面积将扩大一点五倍。除现有的国营农场以外，将另建二十五个国营农场。
    他说，在邮政和交通方面将集中努力把安员—睦南关铁路和东英—太原铁路的轨距放宽到一点四三五米，并将河内—清化铁路线延长到宜安。
    他说，在文化、教育和公共卫生方面，根据五年计划，越南北方将有容纳四万大学生的十五所大专院校和容纳八万五千学生的七十六所中等专业学校。在这个期间，受过训练的技术工人的人数将达二十万。同时，各级领导干部将受不同程度的进修教育。
    他说，到1965年，出版的书籍将比1960年增加一点五倍。医院将从六十五所增加到一百零六所，附属医院的诊所将从一百八十一所增加到二百九十五所，医院病床从二万一千七百零五增加到三万。每一个村将有民办的附属医院，这些医院将有五万多张病床。
    他在谈到改善人民生活这一问题时说，大多数农业合作社社员的收入将达到和超过上中农目前的收入。手工业者和小商贩也将不断增加收入。工人、公务人员、干部等的工资也将继续提高，工资制度必须进一步改善。同时，必须重视发展物质和文化福利以及扩大社会基金。
    他接着提出了具体制订五年计划所必需遵循的五个主要方针。这些方针是：一，为社会主义初步奠定物质和技术基础，务必同完成社会主义改造密切结合起来。在这两个任务中，前者是引导社会主义革命前进的最有决定意义的一环，而完成社会主义改造是一个十分重要的任务。二，发展工农业同时并举，优先发展重工业，同时努力全面发展农业和轻工业。三，合理分配平原和山区的生产力，以便消除目前各个地区和工农业之间生产力分配不平衡的现象。四，在国家建设中发扬勤俭的精神，正确地解决积累和消费之间的关系的问题。应当注意增加积累，以满足发展生产的需要。同时，在发展生产的基础上，应当极其重视逐步提高人民的生活水平。五，加强同社会主义阵营其他国家的国际合作。
    阮维祯在报告的最后部分谈到加强国民经济的计划性和领导执行计划的问题。
    他说，在第一个五年计划完成以后，全民所有制和集体所有制这两种社会主义生产关系的形式，将在国民经济中占绝对统治地位，农业、交通运输，特别是工业方面的技术基础将初步奠定；经济建设的干部和熟练工人的人数将有所增加，他们的质量也将有一定程度的提高；群众的爱国竞赛运动，将变得更加广泛，更加生气勃勃。
    他说，在农业方面，合作社将把原来是分散经营的小生产逐渐纳入规模日益扩大的组织中。同时，将牢靠地解决粮食问题，并发展多种经济，特别要增加工业作物和牲畜的数量，从而为社会主义工业化创造有利的条件。
    他说，在工业方面，在五年计划之后，越南北方将建成十多个工业区，其中包括河内、太原、越池、海防和鸿基等工业比较集中的地区。在山区，现在已经开始建设若干重要的工业基地。重工业和轻工业的主要部门将被建成为日益平衡发展的体系，以便能满足钢铁和化学肥料方面的大部分需要，满足装备方面的一部分需要，满足劳动人民生活消费品的几乎所有的需要。
    他说，随着经济方面的发展，在生产量日益增加的基础上，劳动人民的物质和文化生活将有明显的进一步改善。
    阮维祯最后说：“我们的前景是十分良好的。我们必须竭尽全力把可能性变成现实。根据代表大会的决议，在中央委员会的领导下，又有兄弟国家的全心全意的帮助，加上我国人民英勇斗争和勤劳的传统，我国人民一定能胜利完成第一个五年计划的各项任务，使北方在社会主义建设道路上稳步迈进，巩固北方而使之成为为祖国的重新统一而进行的斗争的坚强基地”。
