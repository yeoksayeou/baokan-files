This newspaper Jinan, 17th - The Yantai Prefectural Party Committee is vigorously promoting advanced experiences in the reform of cooking utensils and grain processing tools. More than four thousand canteens in the region have now basically achieved semi-mechanization.

Preliminary assessments indicate that the most labor-saving and efficient tools are the universal stone mill, the universal insulated steam stove, "native" running water, complete sets of vegetable cutting machines, and complete sets of peeling and rice milling machines. For example, the "powered universal stone mill" created by Zhang Yongwen of Haiyang plays a significant role in saving labor and animal power. The "powered universal stone mill" can grind 600 jin of coarse grain per hour, which is much more efficient than the old-fashioned stone mill. The animal-drawn universal stone mill can grind 60 jin per hour, increasing efficiency seven times compared to the old-fashioned mill, with a flour yield of 69.5%, which is 1.5 jin more per 100 jin than before. The universal insulated steam stove created by Zhaoyuan County can perform five tasks at the same time (cooking, boiling water, stir-frying, disinfecting tableware, and keeping food warm), and also saves a significant amount of fuel. The result of the cooking tool reform is not only an improvement in the quality of food but also a saving of labor. For example, the Zhangjia Production Team canteen in Bunan, Zhaoyuan County, previously had 45 catering management personnel. After the reform of cooking utensils, it has been reduced to 15 people.

Currently, the Yantai area is widely utilizing various energy sources (firepower, wind power, water power), developing multiple uses for one machine, universally promoting powered universal mills, vigorously developing "native" running water and universal insulated steam stoves, and ensuring that grain processing tools and cooking utensils are complete sets.

This newspaper reports that all people's communes in Yancheng Prefecture, Jiangsu Province, are actively converting old-style stoves in public canteens into small-mouth backdraft insulated stoves. In Yancheng, Jianhu, Dongtai and other counties where progress is faster, 85% to 95% of the canteens have been converted to the new stoves. A number of production team canteens in each county have completely converted to the new stoves. After the new stoves are converted, basically every one is in use, each saves grass, and is deeply welcomed by the masses.

The small-mouth backdraft insulated stove was created by Dancheng County, Henan Province. Calculated on the basis of boiling 50 jin of water, the old-fashioned stove required 19 jin of grass, while the new stove only requires 6 jin. The new stove saves about two-thirds of the grass compared to the old-fashioned stove, and about half the grass compared to the improved exhaust stove. The structure of the new stove is not complicated, and not many materials are needed, so the prefectural party committee decided to carry out a crash program of stove conversion, striving to build small-mouth backdraft insulated stoves in place of the old-fashioned stoves in rural public canteens in batches in the shortest possible time.

All localities have solved the problem of technical manpower through organizing short-term training, on-site visits, learning by doing, and teaching apprentices, etc. The prefectural party committee instructed the Life Office and the Grain Bureau to run training classes, training more than 200 people in total, with one or two key personnel in each of the 140 communes in the region. Subsequently, bricklayers and skilled farmers were trained in a concentrated manner, either by county or commune. Now, each commune has formed a professional team, which is actively carrying out stove conversion work under the unified leadership of the commune party committee.

The promotion of small-mouth backdraft insulated stoves has made more and more people see the superiority of collective life and the Party's deep concern for the lives of the people. The masses' enthusiasm for production is particularly high. The members of the Cai Xu Brigade of the Jinhu Commune in Jianhu County wrote a letter of thanks to the county party committee, saying: "The Communist Party is like a dear mother, taking care of everything related to cooking. We will go all out in production and repay the Party with more grain."

    烟台专区四千个食堂炊具大改革
    盐城专区推广小口回风灶节省大量柴草
    本报济南17日电　中共烟台地委大力推广炊事用具和粮食加工工具改革的先进经验。现在全区已有四千多处食堂基本上实现了半机械化。
    初步鉴定，节省劳力最多、效能最大的是万能石磨，万能保温蒸气灶，土自来水，配套成龙的切菜机和配套成龙的脱皮机、碾米机等加工工具。如海阳张永文创造的“动力万能石磨”，对节省劳力和畜力作用很大。“动力万能石磨”每小时可磨粗料六百斤，比旧式石磨工效高很多。畜拉万能石磨每小时可磨六十斤，比旧式磨提高工效七倍，出粉率达到69.5％，较原来每百斤多一斤半。招远县创造的万能保温蒸气灶，在同一时间能作五样活（做饭、烧水、炒菜、饭具消毒、食物保温），还节约大量燃料。炊事工具改革的结果，不仅饭菜质量比过去有了提高，而且节省了劳动力。如招远县埠南张家生产队食堂，过去有炊事管理人员四十五名，炊事用具改革以后，现已减少到十五人。
    现在，烟台地区正广泛利用各种（火力、风力、水力）能源，开展一机多用，普遍推广动力万能磨，大搞土自来水、万能保温蒸气灶，并使粮食加工工具和炊具配套成龙。
    本报讯　江苏盐城专区各人民公社，都在积极把公共食堂的旧式灶改为小口回风保温灶。进度较快的盐城、建湖、东台等县，已有85％到95％的食堂改用新灶。各县都有一批生产队食堂全部改用新灶。新灶改成后，基本上座座有用，个个省草，深受群众欢迎。
    小口回风保温灶是河南省郸城县创造的。以烧水五十斤计算，老式灶要十九斤草，新灶只用六斤就够了。新灶比老式灶节约烧草三分之二左右，比改良的抽风灶也节约烧草一半左右。新灶构造不复杂，需用材料不多，因此地委决定突击进行改灶工作，力争在最短期间内，把农村公共食堂的旧式灶，都分批建成小口回风保温灶。
    各地都通过组织短期培训，现场参观，边学边干，以师带徒等方法，解决了技术力量的问题。地委责成生活办公室和粮食局举办训练班，共培训了二百多人，全区一百四十个公社每社都有一至两个骨干。随后，又以县或公社为单位，集中训练瓦工和巧农民。现在各公社都形成了一支专业队伍，在公社党委统一领导下，积极进行改灶工作。
    推广小口回风保温灶，使越来越多的人看到了集体生活的优越性，和党对人民群众生活的亲切关怀。群众的生产热情格外高涨。建湖县近湖公社蔡徐大队的社员给县委写了感谢信说：“共产党像亲娘，锅上锅下都管上，鼓足干劲搞生产，多收粮食报答党。”
