The staff and workers of the Xuchang Steel Plant Coking Branch (formerly Xuchang Coking Plant), a national coking red banner unit in Henan Province, are continuing to hold high the red flag in the current movement to increase production and practice economy, advancing victoriously, and determined to produce more coke and better coke to ensure high-quality and high-yield steel production.

The Xuchang Steel Plant Coking Branch was originally a coal supply station of the Xuchang City Commercial Bureau, with only six or seven small earthen stoves. Since 1958, with the need for large-scale steel production, the coking earthen stoves have been continuously improved and increased. In 1959, a No. 1 Red Flag coking furnace and six No. 2 Red Flag simple coking furnaces were successively built, developing from a small earthen group to a small modern group of coking units. For the past two years, because they have consistently adhered to and implemented the general line of socialist construction and adhered to the policy of combining indigenous and foreign methods, they have maintained high quality and high yield. In 1959, it was rated as a national coking red flag unit. In the first half of this year, they have already overfulfilled the state plan, and the average daily output of a single No. 2 Red Flag coking furnace has exceeded the design level by more than double. The ash and sulfur content of coke are both lower than the national standards, the mechanical strength of coke has reached more than 300 kilograms, and the coking rate has reached 75%. Currently, the output and quality of coke are continuing to improve.

On the premise of vigorously improving the quality of coke, they have also actively developed the comprehensive utilization of coal, and have extracted 108 kinds of chemical products from coal, with 15 kinds of products that are regularly produced in large quantities. By mid-June, the plant had achieved cost-free coking.

The Xuchang Steel Plant Coking Branch has been able to achieve such great achievements mainly because they have consistently adhered to the policy of high quality and high yield, and constantly carried out ideological and technological revolutions.

Coal washing is an important link in high-quality and high-yield coke production. Under any circumstances, they never relax this work. When using earthen stoves for coking in 1958, they adopted manual screening and earthen trough coal washing to ensure that raw coal was not put into the furnace without washing. In March 1959, when the No. 2 Red Flag coking furnace was put into production, when coal washing could not keep up with the needs of coking, the Party organization still firmly grasped the coal washing link, ensuring that raw coal was not put into the furnace without washing. At the same time, they mobilized the masses to learn from foreign experience and vigorously carried out the coal washing technological revolution. Leading cadres and workers together experimented more than 200 times and successfully developed the first jigging coal washing machine, finally realizing the mechanization of coal washing. After continuous improvement, they transformed the jigging coal washing machine, which could only handle coal washing tasks, into a combined coal washing machine that integrated coal washing, coal selection, and crushing, greatly improving the output and quality of coal washing. Originally, the daily output of coal washed by the indigenous method was 120 tons, the recovery rate of refined coal reached 60%, the ash content was 19%, and the sulfur content was 0.93%. After using the combined coal washing machine, it can wash about 500 tons of raw coal per day, the recovery rate of refined coal reaches 70%, the ash content is reduced to below 13%, and the sulfur content is reduced to below 0.4%, fundamentally solving the contradiction that coal washing cannot keep up with coking.

In terms of raw coal treatment, they not only paid attention to improving coal washing equipment, but also, based on the problem that wet coal entering the furnace for coking easily lowers the furnace temperature, prolongs the coking time, and affects the life of the furnace, they carried out experiments on drying and heating refined coal on the top of the furnace for coking, creating a record of coking one furnace in 12 hours and 50 minutes, with a coking rate of 81%, and promoted this experience throughout the plant. They replaced the steel plate for drying coal with refractory bricks and established three drying kilns, so that all refined coal entering the furnace was dried and preheated. After the refined coal was dried and preheated, the coking time was shortened, which greatly increased the average daily output of a single furnace by about double.

Maintaining a high furnace temperature is also an important link in achieving high-quality and high-yield coking. The No. 2 Red Flag coking furnace of the Xuchang Steel Plant Coking Branch itself does not have a heat storage chamber, and the temperature fluctuates greatly. In view of this situation, they clearly put forward the requirement of taking furnace temperature as the key in production, set up temperature adjustment personnel, carried out patrol inspections, and took different measures according to climate changes to ensure the normal operation of the blower and unobstructed pipelines. At the same time, they strengthened furnace maintenance to prevent air leakage from the furnace body, and created a windlass type coke pulling machine, realizing the mechanization of coke pulling and coal loading, achieving fast coke removal, fast coal loading, and fast door sealing, so that the furnace temperature was not greatly affected.

In order to improve the quality of coal washing, the coking workshop, the washing and selection workshop, and the supply and transportation units have also established a contact system of mutual cooperation and mutual supervision. The supply and transportation units manage raw coal according to coal quality classification to facilitate coal blending; the washing and selection workshop ensures fine washing and fine selection; the coking workshop has a special person responsible for drying coal to ensure that coal is not blended without washing, and that it is not put into the furnace without being washed clean, dried, and preheated. In terms of coking, single furnace management is changed to two furnaces per group, unified leadership, unified dispatch, and strengthened cooperation. Workers have established a strict shift handover system to jointly ensure high-quality and high-yield furnaces. In order to ensure the quality of coke, a quality testing organization and testing system have also been established to ensure that unqualified coke does not leave the factory.

    许昌钢铁厂焦化分厂继续高举炼焦红旗
    开展洗煤技术革命
    一贯坚持洗煤炼焦
    本报讯　全国炼焦红旗单位——河南省许昌钢铁厂焦化分厂（原许昌焦化厂）职工，在目前的增产节约运动中，继续高举红旗，乘胜前进，决心多炼焦，炼好焦，保证钢铁优质高产。
    许昌钢铁厂焦化分厂，原来是许昌市商业局的一个煤炭供应站，仅有六、七座小土炉。1958年以来，随着大办钢铁的需要，炼焦土炉不断改进和增加，1959年又陆续建立起一座一号红旗炼焦炉和六座红旗二号简易炼焦炉，由小土群发展成为一个小洋群的炼焦单位。两年来，由于他们一贯坚持贯彻执行社会主义建设总路线，坚持土洋结合的方针，一直保持着优质高产。1959年评为全国炼焦红旗单位。今年上半年，他们已经超额完成了国家计划，而且使红旗二号炼焦炉的平均单炉日产量超过了设计水平一倍以上，焦炭灰分和硫分都低于国家指标，焦炭机械强度达到三百公斤以上，结焦率达到75％。目前，焦炭产量、质量还在继续提高。
    在大力提高焦炭质量的前提下，他们还积极发展了煤的综合利用，已经从煤炭中提取化工产品一百零八种，经常大量生产的产品有十五种。到6月中旬，全厂已实现了无成本炼焦。
    许昌钢铁厂焦化分厂能够取得这样大的成绩，主要是他们一贯坚持优质高产方针，不断进行思想革命和技术革命的结果。
    洗煤是焦炭优质高产的重要环节，他们在任何情况下，从不放松这一工作。1958年土炉炼焦的时候，他们就采取了人工筛选和土流槽洗煤，做到了原煤不洗不入炉，在1959年3月红旗二号炼焦炉投入生产，洗煤跟不上炼焦需要时，党组织仍然坚定不移地抓住洗煤这个环节，原煤不洗不入炉，同时发动群众学习外地经验，大搞洗煤技术革命。领导干部与工人一起，先后试验二百多次，研究制造成功了第一台跳汰式洗煤机，终于实现了洗煤机械化。以后经过不断改进，他们又把仅能担负洗煤任务的跳汰式洗煤机，改为洗煤、选煤、粉碎三合一的联合洗煤机，大大提高了洗煤的产量和质量。原来土法洗煤日产一百二十吨，精煤回收率达到60％，灰分为19％，硫分为0.93％，使用联合洗煤机以后，可以日洗原煤五百吨左右，精煤回收率达到70％，灰分降低到13％以下，硫分降低到0.4％以下，从根本上解决了洗煤跟不上炼焦的矛盾。
    在原煤处理上，他们不仅注意改进洗煤设备，还根据湿煤入炉炼焦容易使炉温下降，延长结焦时间，影响炉子寿命的问题，进行了精煤在炉顶炕干加热炼焦的试验，创造了十二小时五十分炼一炉焦，结焦率达到81％的纪录，并把这一经验在全厂推广开来。他们以耐火砖代替炕煤的钢板，建立了三个干燥炕，使入炉精煤全部经过干燥预热处理。精煤实行干燥预热以后，结焦时间缩短，从而使单炉平均日产猛增一倍左右。
    经常保持炉子高温，也是实现炼焦优质高产的一个重要环节。许昌钢铁厂焦化分厂红旗二号炼焦炉本身没有储热室，温度升降波动较大。根据这种情况，他们在生产中明确地提出了以炉温为纲的要求，设立了调温人员，进行巡回检查，并根据气候变化情况，采取不同措施，做到鼓风机正常运转，管道畅通无阻，同时加强炉子维修，使炉体不跑风漏气，并且创造了绞索式拉焦机，实现了拉焦、装煤机械化，做到快扒焦、快装煤、快封门，不使炉温受到大的影响。
    为了提高洗煤质量，炼焦车间与洗选车间、供销运输单位，还建立了彼此协作，互相监督的联系制度。供销运输单位按煤质分类管理原煤，便于配煤；洗选车间保证精洗精选，炼焦车间设专人负责炕煤，保证做到煤不配不洗，不洗净不干燥预热不入炉。在炼焦方面，改单炉管理为两炉一组，统一领导，统一调度，加强协作。工人上下班建立了严格的交接班制度，协力保证炉子优质高产。为了保证焦炭质量，还建立了质量化验机构和化验制度，保证焦炭质量不合格不出厂。
