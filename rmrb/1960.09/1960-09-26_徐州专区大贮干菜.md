Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, 25th. Xuzhou Prefecture, Jiangsu Province, while seizing the opportunity to carry out autumn vegetable production, is vigorously engaged in autumn vegetable storage and processing.

Xuzhou Prefecture has currently planted more than 500,000 mu of autumn vegetables, more than 140,000 mu more than the same period last year. In order to meet the needs of the masses for vegetables in winter and spring, the Xuzhou Prefectural Committee of the Communist Party of China, in addition to requiring all localities to strengthen the management of vegetable fields and strive to harvest more autumn vegetables, also put forward the requirements of storing dried vegetables and pickles to the people of the entire region. In Pei County, 20,000 to 30,000 people participate in harvesting and storing vegetables every day, and 5.85 million jin of dried vegetables have now been stored and dried.

The work of storing vegetables in various places is mainly centered on canteens, establishing organizations, formulating plans, rationally determining quotas and remuneration, etc., to fully mobilize the enthusiasm of commune members to store vegetables. Pei County adopted the method of combining surprise attacks and regular vegetable storage, and promoted the experience of each laborer "taking a basket of fertilizer to the lake, and bringing back a basket of vegetables". The people in the towns also actively responded to the call to collect and store large quantities of dried vegetables. The Ganyu County Party Committee organized more than 2,000 people from organs, groups, schools, factories, and mines and other larger catering units to collect vegetables, and during the two days of the 16th and 17th, they collected and stored more than 70,000 jin in a concentrated effort.

　　徐州专区大贮干菜
　　据新华社南京二十五日电　江苏徐州专区在抓紧时机进行秋菜生产的同时，大搞秋菜贮存和加工。
    徐州专区目前已种秋菜五十多万亩，比去年同期多种了十四万多亩。为了满足冬春两季群众吃菜需要，中共徐州地委除要求各地加强菜田管理，力争多收秋菜外，还向全区人民提出了贮存干菜和腌菜的要求。沛县全县每天二、三万人参加收菜、贮菜工作，现在已贮晒干菜五百八十五万斤。
    各地大搞贮菜工作，主要是以食堂为中心，建立组织，制订规划，合理确定定额报酬等，充分调动社员贮菜的积极性。沛县采取了突击与经常贮菜相结合的办法，并推广了每个劳力“下湖带筐肥，回来带筐菜”的经验。城镇人民也积极响应号召，大采大贮干菜，赣榆县委组织机关、团体、学校、厂矿等较大的伙食单位两千余人去采菜，十六日、十七日两天突击采贮了七万多斤。
