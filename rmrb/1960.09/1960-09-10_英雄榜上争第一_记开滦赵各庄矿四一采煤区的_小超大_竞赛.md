Competing for First Place on the Roll of Honor
    ——A Record of the "Small Surpassing Large" Competition in the No. 41 Coal Mining Area of Kailuan Zhao Gezhuang Mine
    By Our Correspondents Liu Fangchen and Zhu Zemin

    Stepping into the Zhao Gezhuang Mine of Kailuan Coal Mine, one is immediately infected by a strong atmosphere of competition. The walls of the three-story miners' building, constructed of stone, are covered with battle reports and good news from various mining areas. Among these countless battle reports and good news, those from the No. 41 Coal Mining Area are the most eye-catching. A huge "Book of Merits" reads, "Heroic Area Creates Another Miracle": The No. 41 Coal Mining Area overfulfilled its August coal production task five days ahead of schedule on August 26. Passing the "Book of Merits" is the "Revolutionary Heroes' Competition Arena." This is where the results of the competition among all seven mining areas in the mine are announced. Occupying the first place is, precisely, the No. 41 Coal Mining Area.

    Is it because the No. 41 Coal Mining Area is the largest, or has the best conditions, that it has won this honor? No, neither is true. In fact, the No. 41 Coal Mining Area is the smallest among the seven mining areas in the Zhao Gezhuang Mine. The "Small Surpassing Large" bumper harvest competition, which is in full swing throughout the Kailuan Coal Mine, was initiated by the No. 41 Coal Mining Area.

    In August, the Party's call to launch a production increase and thrift campaign centered on grain and steel excited the miners. In large and small meetings, the miners engaged in heated discussions. The No. 41 Coal Mining Area, with its thirty-nine mining groups and more than two hundred and eighty miners working in three shifts, discussed for three consecutive days.

    The Zhang Lianming tunneling team had a particularly lively debate. The focus of their debate was how coal miners should support grain and steel production.

    "We don't till the land to grow grain, we just produce more coal!"
      "Why should we produce more coal?"
    "Increasing grain production requires agricultural mechanization, and building more agricultural machinery requires more steel production. The great development of industrial production also requires more steel, and producing steel cannot be separated from coal!"
    "Producing more coal means producing more steel, which means producing more grain!"
    Through discussion, the miners gained a clearer understanding of the current excellent situation and clarified their glorious responsibilities.

    "Everything for more coal production" became the miners' unanimous slogan. The miners' ambition was truly unstoppable. A "Small Surpassing Large" competition thus began in the No. 41 Coal Mining Area. They chose a large area—the No. 61 Coal Mining Area—as their competition opponent and put forward a bold slogan: Small area surpasses large area, small area has great ambition, we must surpass No. 61!

    Of course, surpassing the No. 61 Coal Mining Area was not an easy task. No. 61 not only had eighty more miners, but also a larger working face.

    On the first day of the "Surpass No. 61" competition, branch secretary Wang Yintang, district chief Liu Zheng, and union chairman Gu Shikui made detailed plans. All three were miners by origin, and they understood every working face and were familiar with every miner. The No. 421 working face was a newly opened face, and the trolley wires for the coal transport carts had not yet been installed, so the coal carts had to be pushed by people. How to ensure the speed of coal transport without delaying coal production was a major key to achieving high output. As soon as the miners on the first shift arrived at six o'clock in the morning, district chief Liu Zheng went down the mine with the workers. Usually, a team of three coal transporters would push more than one hundred and twenty carts of coal per shift, which was considered a good achievement, but this shift pushed more than two hundred and forty carts.

    At two o'clock in the afternoon, branch secretary Wang Yintang went down the mine with the second shift. Wang Yintang looked at the underground record board and saw that the six o'clock shift had pushed more than two hundred and forty carts, more than double the usual amount, making a strong start. He couldn't help but cheer inwardly: the district chief led this group of "little tigers" to do a really beautiful job. "Okay, the district chief and I will have a match too!" He met the shift leader Liu Yongchun, who said, "We're here to push coal, and you coal miners have to prepare the coal." Liu Yongchun's enthusiasm rose when he heard this: "Secretary, as long as you have carts, we guarantee you'll have coal."

    "Okay, if there's no coal, you're responsible; if there are no carts, I'm responsible." After Wang Yintang finished speaking, he held a "Zhuge Liang meeting" with the coal transport workers Yao Enlin, Xu Jinpu, and Bian Wenhua. After making arrangements, they pushed carts, hung chains, and worked together with the workers. Yao Enlin shouted as he pushed the cart: "The secretary is taking the lead, we have to work harder!" "We must surpass the six o'clock shift!" As a result, this shift pushed more than two hundred and fifty carts, setting an even higher record.

    On this day, the No. 41 Coal Mining Area produced more than two hundred and twenty tons more coal than the No. 61 Coal Mining Area. It was really remarkable! Even the sales staff at the mine's supply station were excited. They pushed tomatoes, sand pears, and watermelons from more than ten miles away in carts, and even carried a congratulatory plaque to congratulate the miners.

    With this successful start, the miners' ambition was even higher. Since a small area could surpass a large area, why couldn't there be a "Small Surpassing Large" competition between shifts, teams, and individuals? Thus, the entire area launched a "Small Surpassing Large" competition of small shifts surpassing large shifts, weak teams surpassing strong teams, new workers surpassing old workers, and night shifts surpassing day shifts.

    At the No. 421 working face, the Zhang Lianming and Jiao Wende tunneling teams worked on the same face, one on the six o'clock morning shift and the other on the two o'clock afternoon shift. The tunneling plan for both teams was three meters per shift, but the Jiao Wende team only achieved a little over two and a half meters, failing to complete the plan. The two teams launched a counterpart competition of weak teams surpassing strong teams. After the counterpart competition was launched, the Jiao Wende team did not catch up for several days. The Zhang Lianming team worked hard and cleverly. They learned the advanced bottom slotting technology from the old blasting worker Zhao Huaian, who had more than thirty years of blasting experience, and also learned the single-eye blasting method of Fu Changjin, a tunneling pacesetter from the No. 61 Coal Mining Area. Their tunneling efficiency increased dramatically. Just as the Jiao Wende team's tunneling reached three meters per shift, the Zhang Lianming team reached four meters.

    On August 25, Jiao Wende went down the mine to take over the shift and was shocked to hear that the Zhang Lianming team's tunneling speed had reached four meters.

      "How did you advance so much?" he asked Zhang Lianming.
    "When we go down the mine, we all carry a prop along the main roadway to the working face, saving material transport time; when we get to the working face, one group drills and blasts, and the other group transports materials. With a good division of labor, work efficiency is also high. If you do the same today, I guarantee the tunneling progress will be fast!"

    Zhang Lianming was a fifty-year-old miner who had been working underground at the Zhao Gezhuang Mine since he was seventeen years old, with more than thirty years of experience. He taught his experience to Jiao Wende without reservation. Sure enough, after learning these experiences, Jiao Wende's team surpassed the Zhang Lianming team on the 25th, with a tunneling progress of four point one meters per shift.

    The next day, as soon as he started work, Zhang Lianming ran to shift leader Zhang Junfeng and asked: "Shift leader, how much did Lao Jiao tunnel yesterday?" Zhang Junfeng said half-jokingly: "Four point one meters, they surpassed you. See what you can do!" Zhang Lianming calculated and said: "It doesn't matter, I guarantee we can pull them down!" Back to the team, Zhang Lianming and the workers carefully calculated, and everyone supplemented and improved the good experiences of the past, found out the shortcomings in the current operation methods, re-adjusted the labor organization, and arranged drilling, blasting, transporting props, and loading coal in a more scientific and reasonable way, giving full play to everyone's role. On the 26th, they surpassed the Jiao Wende team again, tunneling four point three meters.

    The miners were catching up with each other, working harder and harder. The backward caught up with the advanced, and the advanced became more advanced. The Jiao Wende team reached four point five meters again, and the Zhang Lianming team created a new record of tunneling four point seven meters....

    The "Small Surpassing Large" most concentratedly demonstrated the miners' soaring enthusiasm, making the entire mining area lively. The No. 41 area surpassed the No. 61 area one after another.

    On August 20, a group of workers from the No. 41 area, led by miner Li Renhui, went to the No. 61 area to deliver battle reports, setting off firecrackers and beating gongs and drums along the way. The miners of the No. 61 area were holding a pre-shift meeting. Li Renhui posted the battle report on the door of the No. 61 area office: "We will always surpass the No. 61 area!" The miners of the No. 61 area immediately began to discuss. Wang Fuxiang, the district chief of the No. 61 area, was also an old miner. He turned around and said loudly to the miners: "Can we let the No. 41 area surpass us?" "We must not let them surpass us!" Not long after Li Renhui left, the miners of the No. 61 area also sent a battle report to the No. 41 area, indicating that they would leave the No. 41 area behind.

    This was considered a competition.

    Engaging in competition is not just about boasting, you have to do what you say. In order to constantly surpass their competitors, the miners in the No. 41 area were all full of energy. Branch secretary Wang Yintang and district chief Liu Zheng seemed even busier. How could they relax when such a heavy burden was on their shoulders? They ate, lived, labored, and consulted with the miners, and seized the opportunity to solve key problems.

    According to the original coal output calculation, a roadway in the No. 6631 working face could be mined for more than a month, and the newly excavated roadway could almost take over. However, after the competition started, with an increase of one or two hundred tons of coal per day, Liu Zheng immediately foresaw the danger of lagging behind in tunneling.

    He immediately handed over this "bottom line" to the workers and posted a "Talent Recruitment Notice": tunneling teams that could guarantee tunneling of more than three point five meters per shift could participate in the "Talent Recruitment Competition." Six tunneling teams unveiled the "Talent Recruitment Notice" and launched a competition to catch up with each other, and all of them exceeded the target of three point five meters of tunneling per shift. The Qi Tiancheng tunneling team, which won the "Talent Recruitment Competition", had an average tunneling speed of four point one five meters per shift. After this competition, the new roadway was tunneled through ahead of schedule, and the old roadway still had five or six days to finish mining.

    The vigorous competition in the No. 41 Coal Mining Area resulted in a double harvest of coal mining and tunneling, and the coal production plan was completed and exceeded every day. On September 1, the results of the August competition for the entire mine were announced. Among the seven coal mining areas of the entire Zhao Gezhuang Mine, the No. 41 area had the most outstanding completion of the coal mining task, overfulfilling the state plan by more than six thousand six hundred tons, producing more than three thousand six hundred tons of coal than its competitor, the No. 61 area!

    英雄榜上争第一
    ——记开滦赵各庄矿四一采煤区的“小超大”竞赛
    本报记者　刘方辰　朱泽民
    走进开滦煤矿的赵各庄矿，立时就会被一股强烈的竞赛气氛所感染。在用石头砌成的三层矿工大楼的两侧，满是各采煤区的战表、捷报。在这无数的战表、捷报当中，四一采煤区的要算是最引人注目的了。一座巨大的“功劳簿”上，写着“英雄区又创奇迹”：四一采煤区在8月26日提前五天超额完成了8月份产煤任务。走过“功劳簿”，就是“革命英雄比武擂台”。这是全矿七个采煤区公布竞赛评比结果的地方。高居第一位的，也正是四一采煤区。
    是不是因为四一采煤区最大，或是条件最好，才争得这个荣誉？不，都不是。说起来，四一采煤区在赵各庄矿七个采煤区里，却是最小的一个。整个开滦煤矿热火朝天开展的“小超大”丰产竞赛，就是四一采煤区发起的。
    8月里，党发出的开展以粮、钢为中心的增产节约运动的号召，激动了矿工们的心。大会，小会，矿工们展开了热烈的讨论。四一采煤区有三十九个采掘小组，三班的二百八十多名矿工，连着讨论了三天。
    张连明掘进小组在讨论的时候争论得很热烈。他们争论的中心，是煤矿工人应该怎样支援粮、钢生产。
    “咱们又不耪地种粮食，就是多出煤！”
      “为啥要多出煤？”
    “增产粮食要搞农业机械化，要多造农业机器就得多生产钢铁，工业生产大发展也需要更多的钢铁，生产钢铁就离不开煤呗！”
    “多出煤就是多出钢铁，就是多打粮食！”
    经过讨论，矿工们更加认清了当前的大好形势，明确了自己的光荣责任。
    一切为了多出煤，成了矿工们的一致的行动口号。矿工们的这股雄心壮志，真是锐不可当。一个“小超大”的竞赛，就这样在四一采煤区开展起来。他们选择了一个大区——六一采煤区做竞赛对手，提出了一个豪迈的口号：小区超大区，区小志气大，一定要超过六一！
    要想超过六一采煤区，这当然并不是一件容易的事情。六一区不光多八十多名矿工，掌子面也大。
    “超六一”竞赛的第一天，支部书记王印堂、区长刘正、工会主席谷士奎作了周密的计划。这三个人都是矿工出身，他们了解每一个掌子面，也熟悉每一个矿工。四二一掌子面是新开的掌子，运煤电车的天线还没有架到洞里，要由人来推煤车，如何保证运煤速度，不误出煤，是实现高产的一个大关键。早晨六点钟上第一班的矿工刚到，区长刘正就跟着工人一起下了井。平常，运煤队三个人一班推一百二十多车煤，就算满不错的成绩了，这一班却推了二百四十多车。
    下午两点钟，支部书记王印堂跟着第二班下了矿井。王印堂一看井下纪录牌，六点的班推了二百四十多车，比平常多一倍，打响了头一炮。他心里不禁暗暗喝采：区长领着这伙“小老虎”们干得真漂亮。“好，我和区长也来个对手赛！”迎面遇到了班长刘永春，他说：“我们推煤来了，你们采煤的可得把煤准备好了。”刘永春一听，劲头上来了：“书记，你们只要有车，我们就保证有煤。”
    “好，没有煤，你负责；没有车，我负责。”王印堂说完，就和运煤工人姚恩林、徐金普、边文华开了个“诸葛亮会”。部署停当，便又推车，又挂链，和工人一道干起来。姚恩林一边推车一边喊：“书记带头干，咱们更得加把劲！”“非超过六点的班不可！”结果，这一班推了二百五十多车，创造了更高的纪录。
    这一天，四一采煤区出的煤超过六一采煤区二百二十多吨。真是了不起呀！连矿上供应站的售货员都激动了。他们从十几里地以外用小车给推来了西红柿、沙果、西瓜，还抬着贺功牌来给矿工们贺喜。
    这一炮打响了，矿工们志气更高了。既然小区都能超大区，为什么不能在班与班、组与组、人与人之间也来个“小超大”？于是，全区又掀起了小班超大班，弱组超强组，新工人超老工人，夜班超白班等“小超大”竞赛。
    在四二一掌子面，张连明和焦文德两个掘进小组在一个工作面干活，一个是早晨六点班，一个是下午两点班。两个组的班掘进计划都是三米，可是焦文德小组只达到二点五米多，完不成计划。两个小组就开展了一个弱组超强组的对口赛。搞了对口赛以后，焦文德小组一连几天也没有追上，张连明小组干得猛，也干得巧，他们学习了有三十多年放炮经验的老炮工赵怀安的底部掏槽先进技术，又学习了六一采煤区掘进标兵傅长进的独眼爆破法，掘进效率直线上升。焦文德小组班掘进刚到三米，张连明小组又到了四米。
    8月25日，焦文德到井下去接班，听说张连明小组的掘进速度达到了四米，吓了一跳。
      “你们怎么进了这么多？”他问张连明。
    “我们下了井，都从大巷顺手带着棵坑木到掌子面，节省运料时间；到了工作面，一拨人打眼放炮，一拨人就去运料。分工分得好，工作效率也高。今天你们也这样干，保险掘进进尺能快！”
    张连明是个五十岁的老矿工，从十七岁起就在赵各庄矿的井下干活，已经有了三十多年的经验。他把自己的经验毫无保留地教给了焦文德。果然，焦文德学习了这些经验以后，25日当天就赶过了张连明小组，班掘进达到了四点一米。
    第二天一上班，张连明就跑到班长张俊峰那里去问：“班长，老焦昨天掘进多少？”张俊峰半开玩笑地说：“四点一米，把你们超过了。看你们怎么办！”张连明算计了一下，说：“没关系，保险还能把他们拉下！”回到小组，张连明就和工人们仔细算账，大家七嘴八舌地把过去好的经验再加以补充提高，又找出了现在操作方法上的缺点，重新调整了劳动组织，打眼、放炮、运坑木、装煤，各个环节都安排得更科学合理，充分发挥了每个人的作用。26日，又超过了焦文德小组，掘进了四点三米。
    矿工们你追我赶，越干越带劲。后进赶先进，先进更先进，焦文德小组又达到了四点五米，张连明小组又创造了掘进四点七米的新纪录……。
    “小超大”最集中地表现了矿工们的冲天干劲，这一竞赛把整个采煤区闹得热气腾腾。四一区接二连三地超过了六一区。
    8月20日，四一区的一批工人由矿工李仁会领着，一路上放着鞭炮，敲锣打鼓，又给六一区去送战表。六一区的矿工们正开班前会。李仁会把战表贴在六一区办公室的大门上：“我们要永远超过六一区！”六一区的矿工们立时纷纷议论起来。六一区区长王福祥也是个老矿工，他转身大着嗓门对矿工们说：“我们能让四一区超过去吗？”“决不能让他们超过去！”李仁会刚走不一会，六一区的矿工们也给四一区送来了一份战表，表示要把四一区丢在后头。
    这算是较上劲了。
    搞竞赛又不是吹大话，说到就得做到。为了不断超过竞赛对手，四一区的矿工们个个都干劲冲天。党支部书记王印堂和区长刘正，就显得更忙一些。千斤担子压在肩上，怎么能轻松呢？他们和矿工一起同吃、同住、同劳动、同商量，抓紧解决关键问题。
    六六三一掌子面的一条巷道，按原来的出煤量计算，还能再采一个多月，新掘的巷道差不多正好可以接替上。可是，竞赛搞起来以后，一天多出一、二百吨煤，刘正立刻就预见到掘进有落后的危险。
    他立刻把这个“底”交给了工人，并且贴出了“招贤榜”：凡是能保证班掘进到三点五米以上的掘进小组，可以参加“招贤赛”。六个掘进小组揭了“招贤榜”，开展了你追我赶的竞赛，结果全部超过了班掘进三点五米的指标。获得“招贤赛”冠军的齐天成掘进小组，平均班掘进速度达到了四点一五米。经过这段竞赛，新巷道提前掘透了，旧巷道还有五、六天才能把煤挖完。
    四一采煤区的轰轰烈烈的竞赛，使回采，掘进双丰收，产煤计划天天完成，日日超额。9月1日，8月份全矿的竞赛战果揭晓了。在整个赵各庄矿的七个采煤区，四一区的采煤任务完成得最出色，超额六千六百多吨完成了国家计划，比它的竞赛对手——六一区，多生产了三千六百多吨煤！（附图片）
