    Agricultural Mechanization in Korea
    By Li Xishu, "Rodong Sinmun" Reporter in Korea
    Currently, rural areas throughout North Korea are striving to achieve comprehensive agricultural mechanization.
    In December of last year, the Central Committee of the Korean Workers' Party issued a call: to realize agricultural mechanization by simultaneously developing large and medium-sized machines, simultaneously developing modern machinery and animal-powered machinery, starting from the plains and gradually expanding to the mountainous areas. Since then, considerable achievements have been made in this area.
    Let's examine how agricultural mechanization is being implemented in An'yue County, Huanghai South Road.
    An'yue County basically completed water conservancy last spring; all twenty li (equivalent to townships in China) in the county have installed electric lights and telephones. In this situation, agricultural mechanization has become the most urgent central task of the agricultural technology revolution.
    In the first half of this year, the state supplied the An'yue Agricultural Machinery Work Station with 114 tractors (bringing the total to 240, each calculated at 15 horsepower), 98 trailers, and many other large agricultural machines.
    In the mountainous areas of Yue Shan, Yue Jing, and Yue Chi in this county, the fields are extremely scattered and the slopes are very steep. At the same time, in the plains, there are also many small-scale operations. In this situation, field operations cannot rely entirely on large agricultural machines. Therefore, the An'yue County Agricultural Implement Factory mass-produces animal-powered agricultural machines and various agricultural implements.
    An'yue County, according to the type of operation, correctly coordinated the use of large and medium-sized machines by using one power machine to tow multiple animal-powered machines. As a result, An'yue County used tractors to cultivate 86% of the paddy field area and 73% of the dry field area this year. At the same time, 38% of the inter-tillage and weeding work in dry fields was also mechanized. In Wu Ju, Da Qiu, and ten other li (in the plains), plowing, harrowing, transportation, and other operations were almost 100% mechanized.
    Last year, due to insufficient labor and animal power, rice transplanting was not completed until early July. This year, the fields were harrowed in advance with tractors, and rice transplanting was completed on June 15. In the past, wheat harvesting and threshing took one and a half months. This year, with wheat harvesters and 54 wheat threshers manufactured in the county, wheat harvesting, threshing, and planting of late-season crops were completed in just 20 days. Therefore, An'yue County saved 277,000 labor days and a large amount of animal power in the first half of this year.
    Due to the implementation of agricultural mechanization, An'yue County has greatly expanded the planting area of double-cropping crops this year, which plays a significant role in increasing grain production, establishing feed bases, and developing animal husbandry.
    The achievements made by An'yue County in agricultural mechanization are just one example among many counties in the plains of North Korea.
    Other regions in northern Korea are also successfully implementing the Korean Workers' Party's policy of fully realizing agricultural mechanization within two to three years.
    In order to further promote agricultural mechanization, the Party and the government are using various methods to improve the role of agricultural machinery work stations; at the same time, they are enabling agricultural cooperatives to give play to their collective creativity and use machinery for all possible mechanized operations.
    Agricultural machinery work stations (formerly called agricultural machinery rental stations until November of last year) previously only handled rental plowing and were collaborators of agricultural cooperatives. Now they have become units that conduct production jointly with agricultural cooperatives. At the same time, the technical equipment of agricultural machinery work stations has also been rapidly strengthened. From July of last year to the end of June this year, the number of tractors increased from 6,100 (calculated at 15 horsepower) to 14,000, and the number of various tractor-drawn farm implements increased from 10,000 to 41,000. In particular, in the plains – Huanghai South Road and Pingan South Road – 2,560 new tractors and 8,764 tractor-drawn farm implements were added, and the majority of耕地 cultivation and搬运 handling operations have been mechanized.
    The scope and types of mechanized operations have also expanded. Tractors, which used to only perform machine耕地 cultivation, are now used to pump water during droughts, produce fertilizer, and engage in transportation, and also provide power for crop threshing. In the first half of this year, the amount of mechanized work done by agricultural machinery work stations increased by 2.6 times compared to the same period last year, and the amount of transportation work increased by 9.5 times.
    Agricultural mechanization requires thousands of tractors, trucks, seeders, weeders, and harvesters, as well as a variety of other agricultural machines. This cannot be supplied in a timely manner by a small number of enterprises in one department; a broader force must be mobilized to serve agricultural mechanization. Therefore, the Korean Workers' Party and the Republic government have adopted the following policy on agricultural machinery production: large factories directly under the central government mainly produce tractors, trucks, and complex tractor-drawn farm implements;道道-run agricultural implement factories mainly produce simple tractor-drawn farm implements and machines needed for animal husbandry; and郡 county-run agricultural implement factories produce animal-powered agricultural machines and small farm implements. All other factories and enterprises should also enhance the role of their machine repair workshops in order to guarantee their basic production tasks while actively producing medium and small agricultural implements needed by rural areas.
    Today, it is impossible to find a county without an agricultural implement factory in any remote mountainous area; there are already more than 230 local agricultural implement factories throughout northern Korea, and they are vigorously producing various agricultural machines and implements.
    The Korean working class not only produces and supplies various agricultural machines needed for agricultural mechanization, but also links up with agricultural cooperatives near factories to support them. Currently, 439 factories and enterprises have been linked up with 1,370 agricultural cooperatives (accounting for about one-third of the total number of agricultural cooperatives) to actively support agricultural cooperatives. They use idle equipment to manufacture various medium and small agricultural machines and implements, and send people to agricultural cooperatives to teach farmers how to use machines and manage the socialist economy.
    With the development of agricultural mechanization, a high tide of technical learning has been set off in rural areas. Rural youth are actively learning to drive tractors and cars; an invention and creation movement of agricultural machinery is unfolding everywhere. (Attached picture)

    朝鲜的农业机械化	朝鲜“劳动新闻”记者　李心塾
    现在，朝鲜全国各地农村，正在为实现农业全面机械化而奋斗。
    去年12月，朝鲜劳动党中央委员会发出号召：在大型机器和中小机器同时并举，现代机械和畜力机械同时并举，从平原地区着手作起、逐渐扩展到山区的原则下，实现农业机械化。从那时起，这方面的工作已经取得不少成就。
    这里考察一下黄海南道安岳郡怎样实现农业机械化。
    安岳郡去年春天基本上完成了水利化；这个郡的二十个里（相当于中国的乡）都架设了电灯和电话。在这种情况下，农业机械化成了农业技术革命的最迫切的中心任务。
    今年上半年，国家供应了安岳农业机器作业所一百一十四台拖拉机（连原有的，共有二百四十台——每台以十五马力计算），九十八部拖车，以及很多其他大型农业机器。
    这个郡的月山、月精、月池等山区，田地极其分散，坡度很陡。同时，在平原区，也有不少小规模的作业对象。在这种情况下，田间作业是不能全部依靠大型农业机器的，因此，安岳郡的郡营农具厂就大量生产畜力农业机器，以及各种农具。
    安岳郡按照作业的种类，用一台动力机器拖带多台畜力机器的方法，正确配合使用了大型机器和中小机器。这样，今年安岳郡用拖拉机耕种了水田面积的86％、旱田面积的73％。同时，旱田的中耕除草工作，也有38％用机械进行。在五局、大楸等十个里（平原区），翻耕、耙田、运输等作业，几乎百分之百地实现了机械化。
    去年，由于劳动力和畜力不足，7月初才插完秧，而今年，事先用拖拉机耙好了田，在6月15日就结束了插秧工作。从前，小麦的收割和脱粒需要一个半月时间。今年，有了小麦收割机，又在本郡制造了五十四部小麦脱粒机，只费了二十天就结束了小麦收割、脱粒和后季作物的播种等工作。因此，安岳郡今年上半年节约了二十七万七千个劳动日和大量的畜力。
    由于实行农业机械化，安岳郡今年大大扩充了双季作物的播种面积，对增加粮食生产、建立饲料基地、发展畜牧业都有很大作用。
    安岳郡在农业机械化方面取得的成就，不过是朝鲜平原地区很多郡中的一个例子。
    朝鲜北部的其他地区，也在成功地执行着朝鲜劳动党关于在二年到三年内全面实现农业机械化的政策。
    为了进一步促进农业机械化，党和政府用各种办法提高农业机器作业所的作用；同时，使农业社本身发挥集体创造精神，把一切可能机械化的作业都用机械来进行工作。
    农业机器作业所（在去年11月以前叫作农业机器代耕站）以前只管代耕，是农业社的协作者，现在变为同农业社共同进行生产的单位了。同时，农业机器作业所的技术装备也迅速地加强了。从去年7月到今年6月底，拖拉机由六千一百台（以十五马力计算）增加到一万四千台，各种机引农具由一万件增加到四万一千件。特别是在平原地区——黄海南道和平安南道，新添了拖拉机二千五百六十台和牵引农具八千七百六十四件，耕地和搬运作业大部分都实现了机械化。
    机械化作业的范围和种类也扩大了。向来只进行机耕作业的拖拉机，现在在干旱时期抽水，并且用来生产肥料和从事运输工作，还提供收获物脱粒工作的动力。今年上半年，农业机器作业所的机械化作业量，比去年同期增加到二点六倍，搬运作业增加到九点五倍。
    农业机械化需要成千上万的拖拉机、载重汽车、播种机、除草机和收割机等多种多样的农业机器，这不是某一个部门为数无几的企业能够及时生产供应的；必须动员更广大的力量为农业机械化服务。因此，朝鲜劳动党和共和国政府在农业机器生产上采取了这样的方针：中央直属大厂主要生产拖拉机、载重汽车以及复杂的机引农具等；道营农具厂主要生产简便的机引农具和畜牧业所需要的机器；郡营农具厂生产畜力农业机器和小型农具。其他所有的工厂、企业也要提高它的机修车间的作用，以便保证本厂、本企业的基本生产任务，同时积极生产农村所需要的中小农具。
    今天，到任何偏僻的山区，没有农具厂的郡是找不到了；整个朝鲜北部已有二百三十多所地方农具厂，它们正在大力生产各种农业机器和农具。
    朝鲜的工人阶级不仅生产供应农业机械化所需的各种农业机器，而且同工厂附近的农业社挂了钩，支援它们。现在，已经有四百三十九个工厂、企业同一千三百七十个农业社（占农业社总数的三分之一左右）挂了钩，积极支援农业社。它们利用闲置的器材制造各种中小型农业机器和农具，并且派人到农业社教给农民使用机器和社会主义经济的经营方法。
    随着农业机械化的发展，农村掀起了学习技术的高潮。农村青年正在积极学开拖拉机和汽车；到处都在展开着农业机器的发明创造运动。（附图片）
