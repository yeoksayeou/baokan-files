    In the heart of a street garden in Conakry, the capital of the Republic of Guinea, stands a tall monument. It is decorated with various colored glass chandeliers. The base of the monument is inscribed with: "Republic Square." Two years ago, on this very pedestal, stood a thorough colonialist – a statue of the French Governor-General. Today, Guineans will proudly tell you: it has been thrown into the garbage dump on the Atlantic coast!
    In the past, this country on the West African coast with a population of over two and a half million was a colony under French rule. Today, it has become a gathering place for progressive people from West and Central Africa. Anti-imperialist fighters from all over the world also come here frequently to discuss world affairs. Not long ago, the Afro-Asian People's Solidarity Conference, the World Teachers' Conference, and the Executive Committee of the World Federation of Youth were held here successively. From here, the representatives issued a strong call against imperialism and colonialism, and for the achievement and maintenance of national independence.
    The people of Guinea are now living in an atmosphere of renewal and freedom. But they have not forgotten that, like all the Black African people under imperialist rule, they had very unfortunate experiences in the past.
    Guinea is truly a beautiful place. In this land of 106,200 square miles, precious natural resources are hidden everywhere. When we visited the Fria area, people told us that Fria and Boké are iron ore areas. Recently, the largest Doukai mining area was discovered.
    Guinea has no winter, with evergreen vegetation, fertile land, and abundant rainfall all year round. Traveling by car from Conakry to the interior, one can see dense coconut groves, palm groves, mango trees, and banana groves covering large and small valleys along the way.
    However, before independence, this country with fertile land and abundant mineral resources had to import 10,000 to 15,000 tons of grain annually from France and other colonialist countries; even vegetables had to be imported from abroad. When driving through the Guinean countryside, one can still see large tracts of wasteland on both sides of the road. When discussing this issue with Guinean friends, they always said angrily: Does our country only produce bananas and mangoes? No, this is the crime of colonialism!
    The people of Guinea originally cultivated rice as their staple food. But since the French colonialists forcibly occupied Guinea in 1891, they not only seized large tracts of fertile land from the farmers, but also forced them to convert these fertile lands into banana and pineapple plantations. The colonialists also controlled Guinea's industry, commerce, banking, and foreign trade. After the banana and pineapple harvest, they transported these goods to Paris. Bananas were an important export commodity of Guinea, and in the past, almost all of them were plundered by French merchants. More than 12,000 tons of coffee produced in Guinea were also transported to Paris every year. The true masters of the country – the Guinean people – only occupied a small amount of barren land for agricultural use. Due to the long-term rule and plunder of the French colonialists, even now, more than 300,000 people in Guinea still maintain primitive lifestyles and farming methods.
    The lives of the farmers are impoverished, with many living in small thatched huts made of mud and grass, and eating only one very simple meal a day. 95% of the country is illiterate. We also saw quiet, green, European-style building areas in Fria and Dalaba. However, these were all former villas of the colonialists. After the colonialists greedily sucked the blood and sweat of the Guinean people and plundered huge profits from the banana and pineapple plantations, they hid here to escape the heat during the hot season.
    Faced with this intolerable rule and plunder, in the dark years, the people of Guinea persevered in their struggle against the French colonialists. President Sékou Touré's grandfather, Samori Touré, is a hero in the anti-imperialist struggle that the Guinean people are proud of. Even today, his deeds are widely circulated in West Africa. When I traveled in the Boffa area in June, friends proudly told me: This is the old base of Guinea's anti-imperialist struggle.
    In the 19th century, when French colonialism began to invade Guinea, Samori Touré led the Guinean people to take up arms, defeated the French expeditionary force here, and forced France to sign a treaty. The wise Samori Touré knew the instability of this peace and the military superiority of France. He used the interval between wars to prepare for further battles. He divided his military forces into two parts, one to resist the French invading army, and the other to protect the people as they moved to other places. This anti-French war lasted for eight years, inflicting heavy blows on French colonialism and shaking the entire West Africa. Since then, the flames of anti-imperialism ignited in Guinea have never been extinguished.
    September 28, 1958, is a day that the more than two and a half million Guineans will never forget. At that time, the French ruling clique attempted to use threats and inducements to force its colonial people to vote "yes" in the referendum on De Gaulle's "Constitution." The Democratic Party of Guinea, headed by Sékou Touré, called on the people to vote "no" and oppose the "French Community." The Guinean people, who had suffered decades of colonial rule and oppression, resolutely responded to the call of the Democratic Party, with 95% of the votes indicating that they did not want colonial rule, but wanted independence. In this way, the Guinean people exposed the tricks played by the colonialists, and their initial wishes were realized. From October 2 of the same year, the tricolor flag of red, yellow, and green of the Republic was flying high above the Presidential Palace. Guinean guards, wearing tall, light green military caps with gold stripes, vigilantly defended it.
    However, De Gaulle and his ilk were unwilling to lose such a beautiful land for reaping huge profits. The French government immediately used despicable means such as severing diplomatic relations, stopping economic aid, and not importing grain to intimidate the Guinean people, attempting to paralyze the newborn Republic of Guinea. However, these threats and intimidation could not shake the Guinean people's determination to take the road of independent autonomy. President Touré solemnly announced to the whole nation: We are happy to raise the banner of freedom and are not afraid of anything. We can overcome all the obstacles that imperialism has placed on our path.
    In 1958, each administrative region of Guinea still had a French-appointed local official who claimed to be the plenipotentiary master. After independence, the Guineans first drove away all these local officials and the French colonialists in the army. At this time, the first task of the Republic was to establish its own administrative institutions. This was indeed not an easy task. But the Guinean government conducted democratic elections for management institutions. More than 4,000 administrative villages were quickly established throughout the country. At the same time, a large number of intellectuals responded to the government's call and rushed to the vast rural areas to support the construction of the regime. The farmers enthusiastically paid taxes to the state, and the national tax plan for 1959 was completed in June. They also paid the so-called "taxes" owed to the colonial government for the three years before independence to the new government. Mass movements of voluntary labor teams were universally carried out in national agencies, schools, and factories.
    The Guinean government also implemented universal compulsory education for children aged seven to fifteen. The number of children in school nationwide was only over 43,000 in the year before independence, but this year it has reached over 83,000.
    In the past, in Guinea, not only was a large amount of land controlled by white colonialists, but also industry, commerce, banking, and import and export trade were controlled by these colonialists. Now, when you stroll through Republic Square, you can see the Guinea Bank Building. This is the national bank that the Guinean government established itself in March this year after expelling the French staff of this bank. Guineans came here with joy to exchange the currency issued by their own country. From then on, the French African francs circulating in Guinea were replaced by Guinean francs.
    In August of this year, the Guinean government also closed the French National Industrial and Commercial Bank, the Société Lyonnaise de Banque et de Crédit and all other foreign commercial banks that controlled everything in Guinea. At the same time, the Guinean government announced:
    Trade must be equal. Aid to Guinea must be in the form of long-term loans, supplying Guinea with machinery and equipment. The imperialists who attempted to strangle this newborn country economically naturally would not accept these conditions. However, at Guinea's difficult moment, the Soviet Union, China, and other socialist countries extended a friendly hand to the Guinean people. The manager of the Guinea Foreign Trade Corporation told me: Just two months after Guinea's independence, East Germany concluded a long-term trade and payment agreement with it, and the Soviet Union also gave Guinea a long-term loan of 140 million rubles without any conditions, and signed an agreement on economic and technical cooperation. Czechoslovakia, Bulgaria, and Poland have also concluded economic and trade agreements with Guinea. The Chinese government also signed a cultural agreement with Guinea and gave the Guinean government and people 15,000 tons of rice.
    At the wharf in Conakry, I often saw freighters flying the flags of socialist countries. These freighters brought machinery, food, and daily necessities to the Guinean people. Recently, I saw large trucks on the streets of Conakry, fully loaded with sacks of grain with the four Chinese characters "中国大米" (Chinese Rice) written on them. The transport workers on the trucks greeted us happily and pointed to the four characters "中国大米" to show us.
    The manager of the Guinea Foreign Trade Corporation told me: The friendly assistance of socialist countries has greatly accelerated the pace of the Guinean people on the road to independence. The imperialists are unwilling to accept their failure in Guinea, and they are trying every means to subvert this newborn country. In the spring of this year, French imperialism bought a large number of spies, attempting to launch a large-scale armed rebellion on May 25 to overthrow the Republic of Guinea. However, the Guinean government shattered this subversion conspiracy on April 21. Now, the Guinean people are more vigilant about the conspiracies of colonialists to undermine the independence of this country.
    On July 1 this year, the Guinean people began to implement their first three-year development plan on their own land. This is the first time that they will use their own hands to develop the rich resources that have been sleeping underground for many years. The total investment in this plan is more than 38.9 billion Guinean francs. The state will use 8 billion francs to develop underground resources and carry out basic construction of public works, ports, and airports. In agriculture, 7 billion Guinean francs will be allocated to help farmers expand their cultivated area, develop grain production, and establish state-owned farms and pastures. At the same time, the plan also guarantees to accelerate the universalization of education, social progress, and improve people's lives.
    The three-year plan states: Its basic goals are to improve living standards, eliminate the colonialized economy, and turn Guinea into a modern country with national development that can participate in the overall African economic upsurge. For the Guinean people who have suffered many years of colonial rule, this plan is so important and so exciting! It encourages the Guinean people to advance more courageously on the road to independence!

    几内亚的昨天和今天
    挣脱了殖民主义枷锁的几内亚人民正在独立的道路上奋勇前进	新华社记者　张自忠
    在几内亚共和国首都科纳克里的街心花园的中心，矗立着一尊高大的纪念碑。它的周围装饰着各种颜色的玻璃吊灯。纪念碑台座上刻着：“共和国广场”。两年以前，就是在这个台座上，还站着一个彻头彻尾的殖民主义者——法国总督的雕像，今天，几内亚人会自豪地告诉你：它已经被扔到大西洋岸上的垃圾堆里去了！
    过去，这个位于西非海岸、二百五十多万人口的国家是一个法国统治下的殖民地。今天，它已成了西非、中非进步人士的汇集地。世界各国的反帝战士，也经常来到这里，共谋世界大事。不久以前，亚非人民团结大会、世界教师大会、世界青年联合会执委会，都相继在这里举行。代表们从这里发出了坚决反对帝国主义和殖民主义、争取和维护民族独立的强大呼声。
    几内亚人民今天已经生活在一种新生、自由的空气里。但是他们没有忘记：像所有处在帝国主义统治下的黑非洲人民一样，他们过去也有过非常不幸的遭遇。
    几内亚真是一个美好的地方。在这块十万零六千二百万平方英里的土地上，到处都蕴藏着珍贵的自然资源。当我们在弗里亚地区参观时，人们对我们说，弗里亚、博凯两个地方是铁矿区。最近，最大的杜凯矿区又被发现了。
    几内亚没有冬天，四季长青，土地肥沃，雨量充足。乘汽车从科纳克里向内地旅行，沿途到处都可以看到密密层层的椰子林、棕榈林、芒果树、香蕉林，布满了大大小小的山谷。
    但是，这样一个土地肥沃、矿藏丰富的国家，独立前每年却都要从法国等殖民主义国家进口一万到一万五千吨粮食，甚至连蔬菜，也都要从外国进口。乘汽车奔驰在几内亚原野上时，还可看到公路两旁，大片荒芜着的土地。同几内亚的朋友们谈起这个问题时，他们总是愤怒地说：我们国家只出产香蕉、芒果吗？不，这是殖民主义的罪恶！
    几内亚人本来是种植水稻作为粮食的。但是自从1891年法国殖民主义者强占了几内亚之后，他们不仅抢夺去了农民们大块的肥沃土地，还强迫把这些肥沃的土地改种香蕉和菠萝。殖民主义者还控制了几内亚的工业、商业、银行、对外贸易。在香蕉、菠萝收获后，他们就把这些东西运往巴黎。香蕉是几内亚出口的重要物资，过去几乎全部被法国商人掠走。几内亚出产的咖啡，每年也有一万二千吨以上被运往巴黎。真正国家的主人——几内亚人民，只占有一点儿贫瘠的土地，做为农业用地。由于法国殖民主义者长期的统治和掠夺，直到现在，几内亚全国还有三十多万人保持着原始的生活方式和耕作方法。
    农民们的生活贫困，许多人住的是用泥和草搭的小茅屋，吃的是每天一顿十分简陋的饭菜。全国95％的人是文盲。我们在弗里亚、达拉巴也都曾见到宁静翠绿、欧洲形式的建筑区。可是，都是些殖民主义者过去的别墅。殖民主义者贪婪地吮吸了几内亚人的血汗，从香蕉、菠萝园里掠夺了巨额利润之后，到了酷热的季节，他们就躲到这儿避暑了。
    面对着这种难以容忍的统治和掠夺，在黑暗的年代里，几内亚人民曾经坚持不懈地同法国殖民主义者进行了斗争。塞古·杜尔总统的祖父萨摩利就是几内亚人引以自豪的反帝斗争中的一位英雄人物。直到今天，他的事迹仍在西非广泛地流传着。6月间我在博发地区旅行时，朋友们就自豪地告诉我：这里是几内亚反帝的老根据地。
    十九世纪，法国殖民主义开始侵入几内亚时，萨摩利率领几内亚人民拿起了武器曾从这里击败了法国远征军，并且迫使法国签订了和约。英明的萨摩利深知这种和平的不巩固以及法国军事上的优势，他便利用了战争的间隙准备着进一步的战斗。他曾把自己的军事力量分出一部分，用来抗击法国侵略军；另一部分保护人民向别的地方迁徙。这一反法战争持续了八年之久，给予法殖民主义沉重打击，震动了整个西非。从那时起，几内亚燃起的反帝火焰就一直没有息灭。
    1958年9月28日，是二百五十多万几内亚人永远难忘的日子。那时候，法国统治集团企图用威胁和引诱来要它的殖民地人民在公民投票中表示“赞成”戴高乐“宪法”。以塞古·杜尔为首的几内亚民主党号召人民投反对票，反对“法兰西共同体”。遭受几十年殖民统治和压迫的几内亚人坚决响应了民主党的号召，以95％的票表示不要殖民主义的统治，而要独立。这样，几内亚人民就戳穿了殖民主义者玩弄的把戏，他们的初步愿望实现了。同年10月2日那一天起，一面红黄绿三色的共和国国旗就高高地飘扬在总统府的上空。几内亚卫兵们戴着高高的镶着金色条纹的浅绿色军帽，警惕地捍卫着它。
    但是，戴高乐之流不甘心失去这样一块攫取高额利润的美好土地。法国政府立即以绝交、停止经济援助、不进口粮食等卑鄙手段来恐吓几内亚人民，企图瘫痪新生的几内亚共和国。然而，这种种威胁、恐吓都不能动摇几内亚人民要走独立自主的道路的决心。杜尔总统庄严地向全民宣布：我们高兴地举起自由的旗帜，什么也不畏惧。我们能克服帝国主义布在我们道路上的一切障碍。
    1958年，几内亚的每个行政区还都有一个法国派来的自命是全权主人的地方官。独立了，几内亚人首先把这些地方官和军队中的法国殖民者全部赶走了。这时，共和国的第一项任务就是建立自己的行政机构。这的确是一件不容易的事情。但是几内亚政府进行了管理机构的民主选举。全国很快就建立了四千多个行政村。同时大批知识分子响应政府号召，奔向广大农村，支援政权建设。农民们踊跃向国家缴纳税收，1959年的全国税收计划在6月份就完成了。他们还把独立前三年欠殖民政府的所谓“税”也都缴给了新政府。全国机关、学校、工厂普遍地开展了义务劳动队的群众运动。
    几内亚政府还实行了对七岁至十五岁儿童普遍的义务教育。全国在学儿童独立前一年只有四万三千多名，今年已达到了八万三千多名。
    过去，在几内亚不仅大片土地操纵在白色殖民者的手里，工业、商业、银行、进出口贸易也都操在这些殖民者的手里。现在，当你漫步在共和国广场上时，你就可以望到几内亚银行大厦。这是今年3月间几内亚政府把这家银行的法国籍职员赶出去以后自己建立起来的国家银行。几内亚人喜笑颜开地来到这里兑换自己国家发行的货币。从此，在几内亚流通的法国非洲法郎就被几内亚法郎代替了。
    今年8月，几内亚政府又封闭了法国国家工商银行、里昂银行总公司等控制了几内亚境内的一切外国商业银行。同时，几内亚政府宣布：
    贸易必须平等。对几内亚的援助，必须是长期贷款形式，供给几内亚机器装备。企图从经济上来扼杀这个新生国家的帝国主义者们自然是不会接受这些条件的。但是，在几内亚困难的时刻，苏联、中国和其它社会主义国家都向几内亚人民伸出了友谊之手。几内亚对外贸易公司经理告诉我：几内亚刚刚独立两个月，民主德国就与它缔结了一项长期贸易和支付协定，苏联也给予几内亚以不附任何条件的一亿四千万卢布的长期贷款，并签订了经济技术合作协定。捷克斯洛伐克、保加利亚。波兰等也同几内亚缔结了经济贸易协定。中国政府也同几内亚签订了文化协定，并赠给几内亚政府和人民一万五千吨大米。
    我在科纳克里码头上，常常看到挂着社会主义国家国旗的货轮。这些货轮给几内亚人民运来了机器、粮食、生活日用品。最近，我在科纳克里的街上看到一辆一辆的大卡车，上面满载着装着粮食的麻包，麻包上写着“中国大米”四个大字。车上的运输工人高兴地向我们打招呼，并指着“中国大米”四个字让我们看。
    几内亚对外贸易公司经理对我说：社会主义国家的友好援助大大加快了几内亚人民在独立道路上的步伐。帝国主义是不甘心它们在几内亚的失败的，他们千方百计地力图颠复这个新生国家。法帝国主义在今年春季收买了大批间谍，企图在5月25日发动推翻几内亚共和国的大规模武装叛乱。但是，几内亚政府在4月21日就粉碎了这一颠复阴谋。现在，几内亚人民对于那些殖民主义力图破坏这个国家独立的阴谋，倍加警惕。
    今年7月1日，几内亚人民开始在自己的土地上执行第一个三年发展计划。这是他们第一次以自己的双手来开发地下沉睡了多年的丰富资源。这个计划的投资总额为三百八十九亿多几内亚法郎。国家将用八十亿法郎开发地下资源，并进行公共工程、港口、机场等基本建设。在农业方面，将拨款七十亿几内亚法郎，帮助农民扩大耕种面积，发展粮食生产，建立国营农场和牧场。同时，计划还保证加速普及教育、社会进步、提高人民生活。
    三年计划写道：它的基本目标是改善生活水平、肃清殖民化的经济、把几内亚变成一个全国发展的能够参加全非经济高涨的现代化国家。这个计划对遭受了多年殖民主义统治的几内亚人来说，是多么重要、多么兴奋的事情啊！它鼓舞着几内亚人民在独立的道路上更加奋勇前进！
