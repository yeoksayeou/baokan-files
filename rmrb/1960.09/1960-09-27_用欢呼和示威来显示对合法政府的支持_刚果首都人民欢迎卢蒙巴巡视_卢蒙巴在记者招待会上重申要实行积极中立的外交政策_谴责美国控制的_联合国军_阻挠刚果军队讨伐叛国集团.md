Xinhua News Agency, September 26th, Leopoldville dispatch: Congolese Prime Minister Lumumba toured Leopoldville city by car for an hour yesterday afternoon and was warmly welcomed by the Congolese people. That evening, Lumumba also said at a press conference held at his residence that the majority of parliament supports him and that he is still the Prime Minister of the Congolese government.

    It is reported that Lumumba drove slowly through the streets, waving to the cheering crowds. As he approached the zoo, his car was surrounded by enthusiastic people cheering him. They scrambled to shake his hand and chanted slogans supporting the Lumumba government. These enthusiastic scenes occurred repeatedly during his one-hour tour.

    After Lumumba's tour, hundreds of people held demonstrations in the streets of the Congolese capital to show their support for the Lumumba government. Later, similar parades occurred again.

    That evening, Prime Minister Lumumba held a 45-minute press conference at his residence on the situation in the Congo.

    Prime Minister Lumumba said at the press conference that his tour of the city was at the request of many delegations, at the request of the people and the military.

    Prime Minister Lumumba announced that, according to the wishes of parliament, he had decided to reorganize the government and would do so and announce it within the week.

    He condemned the "government" organized by Mobutu's coup, supported by imperialism, as "illegal and unacceptable."

    Lumumba reiterated that the foreign policy determined by the Congolese parliament is one of active neutrality. He said that Mobutu's illegal act of forcibly evacuating the Soviet embassy from the Congo was "unjustified." He said: "Parliament should decide to sever diplomatic relations with any country."

    He also condemned the U.S.-controlled "UN forces" for obstructing the Congolese government army's campaign against the traitorous clique in Katanga province.

    At the press conference, Lumumba expressed his belief that Kasavubu agreed with his view that they should both maintain their original positions. He said, "I am against civil war and advocate harmony among all Congolese people."

    According to reports from Leopoldville today, hundreds more people demonstrated in Leopoldville early this morning. They surrounded the government building occupied by Mobutu's soldiers and set up picket lines at every entrance to the building, preventing personnel from the so-called "Committee of Commissioners" organized by Mobutu from entering.

    Mobutu then sent more of his police to suppress the demonstrations, beat the demonstrators, and arrested some people. However, many demonstrators carrying placards supporting the legitimate government continued to march until they dispersed in front of Lumumba's residence.

    用欢呼和示威来显示对合法政府的支持
　　刚果首都人民欢迎卢蒙巴巡视
  　卢蒙巴在记者招待会上重申要实行积极中立的外交政策
  　谴责美国控制的“联合国军”阻挠刚果军队讨伐叛国集团
    新华社26日讯　利奥波德维尔消息：刚果总理卢蒙巴昨天下午乘汽车在利奥波德维尔市巡视了一小时，受到刚果人的热烈欢迎。当天晚上，卢蒙巴还在他的住所举行的记者招待会上说，议会多数支持他，他仍然是刚果政府总理。
    据报道，卢蒙巴乘着汽车在街道上徐徐行驶，向欢呼的人们致意。在快到达动物园时，车子的四周挤满了热烈向他欢呼的人群。他们争着同他握手，并高呼支持卢蒙巴政府的口号。在他巡视的一小时内，一再出现这种热烈的场面。
    在卢蒙巴巡视之后，数百人在刚果首都街道上举行了游行示威，表示支持卢蒙巴政府。后来，又再次出现了同样的游行。
    当晚，卢蒙巴总理在他的住所就刚果局势举行了四十五分钟的记者招待会。
    卢蒙巴总理在记者招待会上说，他在市内巡视是因为有许多代表团要求他在市内出现，是应人民和军人的要求。
    卢蒙巴总理宣布，根据议会的希望，他决定改组政府，并将在本周内进行和宣布。
    他谴责受到帝国主义支持的由蒙博托发动政变所组织的“政府”是“非法和无法接受的”。
    卢蒙巴重申，刚果议会确定的外交政策是积极中立的外交政策。他说，蒙博托非法迫使苏联使馆暂时撤离刚果的行动，是“无理由的”。他说：“应该由议会决定同任何国家断绝外交关系。”
    他还谴责由美国控制的“联合国军”阻挠刚果政府军讨伐加丹加省叛国集团的行为。
    卢蒙巴在记者招待会上表示，他相信卡萨武布同意他的看法，即他们两人都应保持原有的地位。他说：“我反对内战而主张一切刚果人和谐相处”。
    据今天来自利奥波德维尔的消息说，又有数百人今天清晨在利奥波德维尔举行示威。他们包围了被蒙博托士兵占领的政府大厦，并在大厦的每个入口处布置了纠察线，阻止蒙博托组织的所谓“专员委员会”的人员入内。
    蒙博托接着增派了他的警察去镇压，殴打示威群众，并逮捕了一些人。但是，许多拿着支持合法政府标语牌的示威者仍然举行了游行，一直到卢蒙巴的住所前才散去。
