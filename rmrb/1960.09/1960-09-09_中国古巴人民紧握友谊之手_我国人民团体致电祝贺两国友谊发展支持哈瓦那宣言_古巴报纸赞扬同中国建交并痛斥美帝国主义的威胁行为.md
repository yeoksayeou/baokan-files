Xinhua News Agency, 8th. The All-China Federation of Trade Unions received a telegram from Odon Alvarez de la Campa, Secretary of Foreign Relations of the Cuban Workers' Union, congratulating the establishment of diplomatic relations between Cuba and China.

The telegram stated: "The revolutionary Cuban Workers' Union expresses the feelings of the Cuban workers and people, and expresses sincere joy at the decision announced by the Cuban National Congress led by Fidel Castro in Havana to establish diplomatic relations with the heroic People's Republic of China. We reiterate our gratitude for the support of the Chinese workers and people. Please accept our fraternal greetings."

The All-China Federation of Trade Unions also sent a telegram to the Cuban Workers' Union today, expressing great joy at the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and Cuba, and expressing admiration and respect for the strong will and heroic spirit of the Cuban people and the Latin American people in their struggle to break free from the shackles of U.S. imperialism. The telegram stated: "The Chinese workers and people are very pleased to hear the decision of the Cuban National Congress to immediately sever all relations between Cuba and the Chiang Kai-shek clique and establish diplomatic relations with the People's Republic of China. The 'Havana Declaration' passed by the Cuban National Congress is a powerful rebuff to the so-called 'Declaration of San José' manufactured by U.S. imperialism. It demonstrates the strong will and heroic spirit of the Cuban people in defending the revolution and the Latin American people in striving to break free from the shackles of U.S. imperialism. Chinese workers extend heartfelt admiration and respect to the Cuban people and the Latin American people. We firmly believe that the militant friendship between the workers and people of China and Cuba in the struggle against U.S. imperialism will be further consolidated and developed."

Xinhua News Agency, 8th. The All-China Youth Federation and the All-China Students' Federation today sent telegrams to the Cuban Socialist Youth League, the Student Department of the Cuban July 26th Movement, the Cuban University Students' Federation, the Cuban Revolutionary Leadership Committee, and the Youth Association of the Cuban Rebel Army, warmly praising and supporting the "Havana Declaration."

The telegrams said that the "Havana Declaration" expressed the determination and strong revolutionary will of the Cuban people and the Latin American people to fight U.S. imperialism to the end, severely criticized the bandit principles of the so-called "Declaration of San José" manufactured by U.S. imperialism, illuminated the path forward for the national democratic revolution movement in Latin America, and made great contributions to defending world peace and the struggle of oppressed nations for liberation!

The telegrams stated that the "Havana Declaration" represents the will of the Cuban people and solemnly announces the establishment of diplomatic relations with the People's Republic of China. Chinese youth and students, like the people of the whole country, are very happy. The people of our two countries are closely united in the common struggle and support each other. The friendship we have forged in battle will continue to develop and strengthen. Justice is on our side! We will win!

Xinhua News Agency, 8th. The National Women's Federation of the People's Republic of China received a telegram from Violeta Casals, head of the Cuban women's delegation that visited China in 1959, congratulating the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and Cuba.

Violeta Casals is the president of the Cuban Association of Dramatic Artists. Her telegram stated: "We joyfully congratulate the establishment of relations between the people of our two countries."

The National Women's Federation replied to Violeta Casals today: "Thank you very much for your telegram. We are very happy to hear the news announced by Prime Minister Castro of the establishment of diplomatic relations with the People's Republic of China, and we wish the friendship between the people and women of China and Cuba to be further consolidated and developed with the establishment of diplomatic relations between the two countries."

Xinhua News Agency, Havana, 7th. Cuban newspapers continue to publish articles in prominent positions, congratulating the decision of the Cuban National Congress to establish diplomatic relations with the People's Republic of China.

"Free Press" exposed the U.S. conspiracy to create two Chinas. The newspaper said that there is only one China: the People's Republic of China. The so-called "Chiang Kai-shek's China" is nothing but "a false illusion," and the United States' insistence on not recognizing the real China is "one of the greatest stupidities of the United States we know." The newspaper condemned the U.S. rulers for "supporting the largest gang in history with the Seventh Fleet."

"Free Press" reported on China's achievements in agriculture, industry, and culture, pointing out the achievements of the People's Communes. The newspaper emphasized that the decision to establish diplomatic relations with China is one of the most serious blows that Castro has dealt to U.S. policy. It is a manifestation of reaffirming national sovereignty and a step towards expanding Cuba's trade position.

The farmers' newspaper "Plow" published an article emphasizing that the Chinese people are a brave and hardworking people, and they are building the future. The People's Republic of China has always given Cuba's revolution sincere and generous support and friendship, and it is the banner of anti-imperialist struggle among the Asian people.

Cuban newspapers also reprinted Chairman Mao Zedong's articles on the people's struggle against imperialism. "Plow" reprinted Chairman Mao's speech against U.S. imperialist intervention in Asia, delivered in June 1950, under the title "Mao Zedong Opposes Imperialism," and published a color photograph of Chairman Mao.

Xinhua News Agency, Havana, 8th. The Cuban "Combat Newspaper" today condemned U.S. President Eisenhower for new interference in Cuba's internal affairs. At yesterday's press conference, Eisenhower rudely attacked Cuba's decision to establish diplomatic relations with the People's Republic of China as a "very serious mistake."

"Street Newspaper" said that Eisenhower's statement is another mistake by the U.S. government, which does not seem to be accustomed to the idea that Cuba is a sovereign country. "Street Newspaper" pointed out that it is foolish for the United States to continue to close its eyes to the reality in China.

"Today's News" asked: "Who gave him—a foreign president—the power to judge the sovereign actions of the Cuban government?" The newspaper said, "Eisenhower may still think that he can interfere in our country's internal affairs as he did in the Batista era, when Cuba had no foreign policy of its own and did what the U.S. State Department wanted in Cuba's name." The newspaper emphasized that "Eisenhower is not in a position to arbitrarily judge the various measures of the revolutionary government, and the revolutionary government is fully responsible to its own people." The newspaper pointed out that Eisenhower's shameless remarks "further expose him as an enemy of the right to self-determination of the peoples of small countries."

    比奥莱塔·卡萨耳是古巴戏剧艺术家协会主席，她的电报说：“我们欢乐地祝贺我们两国人民关系的建立。”

    新华社哈瓦那7日电　古巴报纸继续以显要地位发表文章，祝贺古巴人民全国大会关于同中华人民共和国建立外交关系的决定。
    “自由新闻报”揭穿了美国制造两个中国的阴谋。这家报纸说，只有一个中国：中华人民共和国。那种所谓“蒋介石的中国”只不过是“一个虚伪的假象”，美国坚持不承认真正的中国是“我们所知道的美国的最大的愚蠢行为之一”。这家报纸谴责美国执政者“用第七舰队支持历史上最大的匪帮”。
      “自由新闻报”报道了中国在农业、工业和文化上的成绩，指出了人民公社取得的成就。这家报纸强调说，决定同中国建交是卡斯特罗给予美国政策的一个最严重的打击，是重申民族主权的表现和扩大古巴贸易阵地的一个步骤。
    农民的报纸“犁报”发表的文章强调指出，中国人民是勇敢和勤劳的人民，他们正在建设未来。中华人民共和国始终不渝地给予古巴革命由衷的和慷慨的支持和友谊，它在亚洲人民中是反帝斗争的旗手。
    古巴报纸还转载了毛泽东主席关于人民反对帝国主义斗争的文章。“犁报”在“毛泽东反对帝国主义”的标题下转载了毛主席在1950年6月发表的反对美帝国主义干涉亚洲的讲话，同时刊出了毛主席的彩色照片。
    新华社哈瓦那8日电　古巴“战斗报”今天谴责美国总统艾森豪威尔对古巴内政进行新的干涉，艾森豪威尔在昨天的记者招待会上粗暴地攻击古巴决定同中华人民共和国建立外交关系是“非常严重的错误”。
    “街道报”说，艾森豪威尔的声明是美国政府的又一个错误，美国政府似乎还不习惯于古巴是一个主权国家的思想。“街道报”指出，美国在中国的现实面前继续闭紧眼睛是愚蠢的。
    “今日报”质问道：“谁给了他——一个外国总统以权力来裁判古巴政府的主权行动？”这家报纸说，“艾森豪威尔可能还以为他可以像在巴蒂斯塔时代那样来干涉我国的内政，那时候，古巴完全没有自己的对外政策，而是以古巴的名义来做美国国务院所要做的事。”报纸强调指出，“艾森豪威尔不是能够任意评判革命政府各种措施的人，革命政府完全对自己的人民负责”。报纸指出，艾森豪威尔厚颜无耻的讲话“进一步暴露了他是各小国人民实行自决权的敌人”。
