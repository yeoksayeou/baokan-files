The situation in the Congo is becoming increasingly serious! The United Nations, manipulated by U.S. imperialism, is brazenly interfering in the Congo's internal affairs, not only placing the Congo in grave danger of losing its national independence and becoming a U.S. colony, but also seriously threatening peace in Africa and the world as a whole. Our government issued a statement yesterday, strongly condemning and protesting the blatant and shameless aggression crimes committed by imperialism, headed by the United States, against the Congo, and firmly supporting the just struggle of the Congolese government and people against imperialism and for the maintenance of national independence and national unity.

Recently, U.S. imperialism has been continuing to do bad things in the Congo in the name of the United Nations, the most important of which are: First, it has brazenly occupied and closed all airports in the Congo, prohibiting the Congolese government and army from using them; second, it has occupied the Congolese national radio station, prohibiting the Congolese government from broadcasting to the people nationwide; third, it supports the separatist groups such as the Congolese imperialist agent Tshombe, protects the Tshombe separatist group in using Elisabethville airport to transport weapons and equipment, and protects Belgian colonialists in providing a large number of weapons, ammunition, and aircraft to the Tshombe army, even colonial military officers directing combat; fourth, it allows so-called "volunteer troops" led by Western colonial military officers to support the Kalonji traitor group in Kasai Province; fifth, it encourages Tshombe group's radio station and other secret radio stations of some separatist elements to incite the division of the Congo; sixth, United Nations Secretary-General Hammarskjöld openly supports illegal actions to subvert the central government of the Congo.

U.S. imperialism is complacent about this sinister practice of using the United Nations to interfere and aggress against the Congo. "The New York Times" shamelessly stated that the United Nations is the "best tool" for the United States to invade Africa. American reactionary commentator Lippmann advocated that "all military actions and all economic actions" in Africa should be "carried out through the United Nations." U.S. Vice President Nixon also came out to promote the plan to use the Congo as a starting point to invade the entire Africa through the United Nations. He said that the events "currently occurring in the heart of Africa" "precisely provide us with" "an opportunity" to infiltrate Africa, advocating that the United Nations establish an "African Development Committee" to engage in "the great work of importing Western aid and investment into this region." Obviously, if the U.S. imperialist plot to use the United Nations to invade the Congo succeeds, Africa will never have peace. With its actions, U.S. imperialism has once again proved that it is the most dangerous enemy of the African people.

Now, the United Nations' criminal activities of aggression against the Congo under the manipulation of U.S. imperialism are becoming increasingly rampant. The "United Nations forces" even attempt to disarm all Congolese forces and "take over" the Congo. The London "Daily Telegraph's" recent editorial revealed that Hammarskjöld "intends to request new powers to be given to the United Nations to take over control of the Congo - using force if necessary." On September 12, under the planning of the United Nations, a small group of people even briefly arrested Congolese Prime Minister Lumumba. However, this plot to murder Lumumba failed, and the Congolese army supporting Lumumba released him. This U.S. imperialist plot further exposes its deliberate and sinister attempt to subvert the central government of the Congo.

The activities of U.S. imperialism in interfering in the internal affairs of the Congo have long aroused the dissatisfaction of the African people. On August 31, the conference of foreign ministers of independent African countries held in Leopoldville passed a resolution declaring that the central government of the Congo is recognized as the only legitimate government, which reflects the will of the African countries and people to support the Congolese people and frustrates the despicable plot of U.S. imperialism to use the Tshombe traitor group to divide the Congo. In recent days, the activities of U.S. imperialism in rudely subverting the legitimate government of the Congo through the United Nations have further aroused the anger of the broad masses of African people and the governments of many African countries. The glorious Guinean army has resolutely announced its withdrawal from the "United Nations forces." Guinean representative to the Congo, Tounkara, solemnly pointed out, "Guinea cannot be an accomplice in any action that turns against any African people!" On September 12, after strongly condemning the "United Nations forces" for blatantly undermining the sovereignty and independence of the Congo and providing opportunities for imperialism to realize the plot to divide the Congo, the UAR also announced its decision to withdraw its troops participating in the "United Nations forces" from the Congo. The UAR and Sudanese troops refused to carry out the order of the "United Nations forces" headquarters to open fire on the Congolese army. The Ghanaian government also demanded on the 13th that the United Nations immediately return the radio station in Leopoldville to the Congolese government, otherwise it would withdraw its troops from the "United Nations forces." After discerning the U.S. imperialist plot to engulf the Congo through the United Nations, the people of African countries are taking action and resolutely standing on the side of the Congolese people, opposing the U.S. imperialist vicious scheme of having Congolese fight Congolese and Africans fight Africans. The Chinese people warmly welcome and firmly support the solemn positions taken by these African countries.

The Congolese people are currently engaged in a heroic and arduous struggle to defend their young republic. The Congolese government, parliament, and the broad masses of the people have expressed great indignation at the crimes of the "United Nations forces" in interfering in the internal affairs of the Congo and infringing on the sovereignty of the Congo, and have lodged solemn protests. As Prime Minister Lumumba pointed out, "We must never tolerate the military occupation of the United Nations!" This is the resounding cry of the Congolese people. The Congolese people, who have waged a long struggle for the cause of independence and freedom, have not succumbed to the bloody rule of the Belgian colonialists in the past, and now they will never be suppressed by the "United Nations forces" manipulated by U.S. imperialism. The Congolese Senate and House of Representatives voted again on the 13th to express full confidence in the Lumumba government and grant it full powers. This is a powerful counterattack by the Congolese people against the United Nations' plot to subvert the central government of the Congo!

The Chinese people resolutelly support the struggle of the government of the Republic of the Congo and the heroic Congolese people to oppose imperialism and safeguard national independence and national unity. The joint communiqué of the President of the People's Republic of China and the President of the Republic of Guinea on September 13 solemnly declared: "Both sides condemn the imperialist plot to interfere in the internal affairs of the Congo and infringe on the country's territorial integrity. Both sides believe that the central government of the Congo is the only legitimate government and has the full right to manage the affairs of the Congo, and no interference by imperialism in any name or form is allowed." At this critical moment when U.S. imperialism is using the United Nations to intensify interference in the internal affairs of the Congo and carry out activities to subvert the central government of the Congo, we call on the people of the world, especially the governments and people of Asian and African countries, to take immediate action to jointly stop the criminal activities of the imperialist group headed by the United States in interfering in the internal affairs of the Congo, demanding that the United Nations immediately return the Congolese radio station and airport to the Congolese government, and immediately stop all plots to invade and divide the Congo and Africa.

We firmly believe that no matter how rampant U.S. imperialism or the United Nations manipulated by U.S. imperialism is in the Congo, it can only be temporary. The united Congolese people will surely, together with the African people and the people of the world, persist in the struggle, smash the U.S.-led imperialist plot to enslave the Congo and enslave Africa, and achieve final victory. The Congolese people will surely win independence, and the African people must stand up, which no imperialism can stop.

### 必须立即制止侵略和干涉刚果的罪行！

    必须立即制止侵略和干涉刚果的罪行！
    刚果局势日益严重了！美帝国主义操纵下的联合国横暴地干涉刚果内政，不仅使刚果面临着丧失民族独立，沦为美国殖民地的严重危险，并且严重地威胁着非洲以至整个世界的和平。我国政府昨天发表声明，严厉谴责并强烈抗议以美国为首的帝国主义对刚果所进行的蛮横无耻的侵略罪行，坚决支持刚果政府和刚果人民反对帝国主义、维护民族独立和国家统一的正义斗争。
    最近以来，美帝国主义假联合国之名，在刚果继续干着坏事，举其大者有：一、悍然占领和封闭刚果的一切机场，不准刚果政府和军队使用；二、占领刚果国家电台，禁止刚果政府向全国人民广播；三、支持刚果的帝国主义代理人冲伯等分裂主义集团，庇护冲伯分裂集团使用伊利沙伯维尔机场运送武器装备，庇护比利时殖民者向冲伯军队提供大量武器、弹药、飞机，以至指挥作战的殖民军官；四、允许由西方殖民军官率领的所谓“志愿军”在开赛省支持卡隆吉卖国集团；五、怂恿冲伯集团的电台及其他一些分裂主义分子的秘密电台煽动刚果的分裂；六、联合国秘书长哈马舍尔德公然支持颠覆刚果中央政府的非法行动。
    美帝国主义对于这次利用联合国进行干涉和侵略刚果的阴险做法，自鸣得意。“纽约时报”无耻地说，联合国是美国侵略非洲的“最好的工具”。美国反动政论家李普曼鼓吹对非洲的“一切军事行动和一切经济行动都通过联合国进行。”美国副总统尼克松也出来宣传以刚果为起点，利用联合国侵略整个非洲的打算。他说，“目前在非洲的心脏”所发生的事件“恰恰向我们提供了”向非洲渗入的“一个机会”，主张由联合国成立“非洲发展委员会”来从事“把西方的援助和投资输入这个地区的巨大工作。”很显然，如果美帝国主义利用联合国侵略刚果的阴谋得逞，非洲将永无宁日。美帝国主义以自己的行动，又一次证明了它是非洲人民最危险的敌人。
    现在，联合国在美帝国主义的操纵下侵略刚果的罪恶活动，越来越嚣张了，“联合国军”甚至企图解除刚果部队的全部武装而“接管”刚果。伦敦“每日电讯报”最近的社论就透露，哈马舍尔德“打算要求给于联合国以新的权力来接管刚果的控制权——必要时用武力手段”。9月12日，在联合国策划下，有一小撮人居然一度逮捕了刚果总理卢蒙巴。但是这一谋害卢蒙巴的阴谋没有得逞，支持卢蒙巴的刚果军队释放了他。美帝国主义的这个阴谋，进一步暴露了它蓄意要颠覆刚果中央政府的罪恶企图。
    美帝国主义干涉刚果内政的活动，早就引起了非洲人民的不满。8月31日，在利奥波德维尔举行的非洲独立国家外长会议就已通过决议，宣布承认刚果中央政府是唯一合法的政府，这反映了非洲国家和人民支持刚果人民的意志，并且顿挫了美帝国主义利用冲伯卖国集团分裂刚果的卑鄙阴谋。近几天来，美帝国主义利用联合国粗暴地颠覆刚果合法政府的活动，更加激起了广大非洲人民和许多非洲国家政府的愤怒。光荣的几内亚军队已经毅然宣布退出“联合国军”。几内亚驻刚果代表通卡拉严正指出，“几内亚不能够在任何转过来反对任何非洲人民的行动中作一个共谋者！”9月12日，阿联在强烈谴责“联合国军”公然破坏刚果主权和独立，并为帝国主义实现分裂刚果的阴谋提供机会以后，也宣布决定把参加“联合国军”的部队撤出刚果。阿联和苏丹军队拒绝执行“联合国军”司令部关于向刚果军队开枪的命令。加纳政府也在13日要求联合国立即把利奥波德维尔的电台交还刚果政府，否则将把它的部队撤出
  “联合国军”。非洲国家的人民在识破了美帝国主义利用联合国鲸吞刚果的阴谋以后，正在行动起来，坚决地站到刚果人民一边，反对美帝国主义以刚果人打刚果人、以非洲人打非洲人的毒计。中国人民热烈欢迎并且坚决支持这些非洲国家所采取的严正立场。
    刚果人民目前正在为保卫自己年青的共和国而进行着英勇、艰巨的斗争。刚果政府、议会和广大人民，都对“联合国军”干涉刚果内政，侵犯刚果主权的罪行表现了极大的愤慨，并提出了严正的抗议。正如卢蒙巴总理所指出的，“我们决不能容忍联合国的军事占领”了！这是刚果人民的响亮呼声。为独立和自由的事业进行了长期斗争的刚果人民，过去没有为比利时殖民主义者的血腥统治所屈服，现在，也绝不是什么美帝国主义操纵下的“联合国军”所能镇压得了的。刚果参议院和众议院13日再次投票表示充分信任卢蒙巴政府，并授予全权。这就是刚果人民对于联合国颠覆刚果中央政府阴谋的一个有力回击！
    中国人民坚决支持刚果共和国政府和英勇的刚果人民反对帝国主义、维护民族独立和国家统一的斗争。9月13日，中华人民共和国主席和几内亚共和国总统联合公报严正声明：“双方谴责帝国主义干涉刚果内政和侵害该国领土完整的阴谋。双方认为刚果中央政府是唯一合法的政府，完全有权管理刚果的事务，不容许帝国主义以任何名义和任何形式进行干涉。”在此美帝国主义利用联合国加紧干涉刚果内政、进行颠覆刚果中央政府活动的危急关头，我们呼吁全世界人民，特别是亚非各国政府和人民，立即行动起来，共同制止以美国为首的帝国主义集团干涉刚果内政的罪恶活动，要求联合国立即把刚果电台和机场交还给刚果政府，立即停止侵略和分裂刚果和非洲的一切阴谋活动。
    我们深信，不管美帝国主义也好，不管美帝国主义操纵下的联合国也好，它们在刚果横行霸道，都只能是暂时的。团结起来的刚果人民，一定能同非洲人民一起、同全世界人民一起，坚持斗争，粉碎以美国为首的帝国主义奴役刚果，奴役非洲的阴谋，取得最后的胜利。刚果人民一定能够赢得独立，非洲人民一定要翻身，这是任何帝国主义都阻挡不了的。
