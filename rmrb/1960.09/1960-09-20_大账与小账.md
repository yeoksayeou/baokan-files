Editor's Note:

    Big Picture vs. Small Picture
    In enterprise management, it is necessary to consider the small picture, but even more important to consider the big picture. The comrades of Fuxin Railway and Coal Mine considered both the small and big pictures when compiling and dispatching direct trains.

    Compiling and dispatching direct coal trains will add a lot of trouble for the enterprise, which is the small picture. But the benefit is that the dwell time of vehicles at fraternal stations will be greatly shortened, and the overall transportation efficiency can be improved, which is the big picture. Therefore, "sacrificing small gains for greater achievements" and focusing on improving overall transportation efficiency is the most correct attitude.

    The relationship between the big picture and the small picture is the relationship between the whole and the part. If all enterprises correctly understand the relationship between the two, it will bring immense benefits to the entire national economy. Judging from the Fuxin example, it is not easy to seriously consider the big picture. It requires a broad vision and an open mind, and in daily economic activities, we must not only care about the interests of our own enterprise, but also care about the interests of fraternal enterprises. In the past, railway departments did not differentiate between varieties or users when compiling and sending coal trains between stations.

    The comrades in Fuxin, considering that the overall interest is above everything else, resolutely adopted the method of direct trains, breaking the past convention and improving the overall transportation efficiency.

    Starting from the interests of the whole, taking the initiative to deliver convenience to others, conducting thorough and detailed investigations into the difficulties of fraternal stations, and caring about others, this valuable proactive spirit is worthy of being promoted.

    大账与小账
    企业的经营管理，要算小账，更要算大账。阜新铁路、煤矿的同志在编发直达列车问题上既算了小账，也算了大账。
    编发直达煤车，对本企业来说，会增添不少麻烦，这是小账。但好处是兄弟车站车辆停留时间会大大缩短，总的来说运输效率却能提高，这是大账。因此，“舍小利而谋大功”，从提高整个运输效率着眼来办事，是最正确的态度。
    大账和小账的关系，是整体和局部的关系。如果所有企业都摆对了两者的关系，就会给整个国民经济带来莫大的好处。从阜新的事例来看，能够认真算大账，并不是容易的。要眼光远大，视界开阔，在日常经济活动中不仅关心自己企业的利益，也要关心兄弟企业的利益。过去，铁道部门车站与车站之间编送煤车，一向是不论品种，不分用户的。
    阜新的同志考虑到整体利益高于一切，就毅然决然地采取直达列车的办法，打破过去惯例，提高了整个运输效率。
    从全体利益出发，主动地把方便送到别人门上去，深入细致地调查兄弟车站的困难，为别人操心，这种可贵的主动精神，值得发扬。
