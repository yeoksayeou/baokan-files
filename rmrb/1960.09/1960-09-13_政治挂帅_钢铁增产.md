Putting Politics in Command, Increasing Steel Production
Our Shanghai Correspondent

A bright red banner has been raised on Shanghai's steel front—No. 1 Iron Melting Furnace of the Second Converter Workshop of the Shanghai No. 3 Steel Plant. During one production cycle, its average hourly melting rate of molten iron reached 19.6 tons, with the highest shift reaching 22 tons. The furnace life reached 281 heats. Both the melting rate and furnace life are more than 50% higher than ordinary furnaces. The desulfurization effect reached 64%, also exceeding the level of ordinary furnaces, making it the first high-yield, high-quality, long-life large-scale iron melting furnace in the country.

The equipment conditions and technical strength of No. 1 furnace are not better than other furnaces. However, because the workshop leadership insisted on putting politics in command, fully relied on the masses to strengthen political and ideological work, so that everyone had a high degree of revolutionary consciousness, and all work sections and types of work cooperated extensively, uniting from top to bottom, and adhering to the implementation of new technical operating principles, they broke through technical barriers and summed up a set of valuable experiences in political and ideological work and production technology.

	Politics at the Furnace Front

Two months ago, when a new set of technical operating principles was introduced to adapt to the technical transformation of the iron melting furnace, the workers of the iron melting furnace section of the Second Converter Workshop proposed to abolish the organizational form of dividing a furnace into three shifts, and demanded that the three shifts cooperate to "contract the furnace operation," organizing production by furnace unit, so as to better strengthen communist cooperation and work together to protect the furnace. The workshop and factory leadership strongly supported this demand of the masses and implemented the "furnace contracting system." At the same time, it was also decided to delegate the management power of the three lines and three materials—the hot air route, material line, iron material, and slag material—to the workers of each furnace themselves, so that leading cadres could free up more time to go deep into the front line of production, and work, discuss, and solve key production problems with the workers. This decision became a major event in the workshop, greatly mobilizing the enthusiasm of the masses of workers. As soon as the decision was announced, several furnaces with better equipment were "contracted" at once, but No. 1 furnace was deserted and no one "contracted" it.

Could it be that the "old master furnace" could not be changed? The young workers of the iron melting furnace section on the night shift discussed it when they went to work in the middle of the night and applied to the general branch to contract No. 1 furnace. However, not everyone among the 18 people in this shift was very confident. Someone looked at the old appearance of No. 1 furnace and said dejectedly: "Contracting this 'old master furnace' is unlucky!" At this time, the secretary of the Party General Branch came to the furnace front and encouraged everyone to have revolutionary ambition, saying that true heroes are produced in struggle. As long as we have determination and confidence, we will definitely be able to transform the "old master furnace." The secretary of the General Branch expressed his determination to the masses that he would work with everyone to take No. 1 furnace as an "experimental field" and turn the "old master furnace" into a red banner furnace. The support of the Party gave the workers of No. 1 furnace great encouragement. Some said, "With the Party at the furnace front, we are more courageous." Some said: "We are not afraid of the furnace being old, as long as our thinking is not old, as long as the 18 of us are of one mind, we can rejuvenate the old master furnace." Soon, in order to quickly grasp the operating rules of large-scale iron melting furnaces, the workshop decided to conduct experimental furnaces. Some advocated using No. 3 furnace, because No. 3 furnace had good equipment. Others advocated using No. 2 furnace, because No. 2 furnace had strong technical strength. However, the Party General Branch and Branch supported No. 1 furnace, believing that the workers of No. 1 furnace had high ambitions and that the subjective initiative of people was the decisive factor. As long as we adhere to putting politics in command, fully rely on the masses, and give play to the consciousness and creativity of the masses, we can create miracles. After deciding that No. 1 furnace would be the workshop's experimental furnace, the secretary of the Party General Branch and the secretary of the Youth League General Branch went to No. 1 furnace to talk about the situation, tasks, and the significance of the experimental furnace, and to tackle key problems with the masses. The leading cadres of the Party General Branch and Branch often participated in the workers' pre-shift and post-shift meetings, changing the past method of "leaders arranging tasks in the pre-shift meeting and the masses making inspections in the post-shift meeting" to workers and masses raising questions, making suggestions, discussing problems, and summarizing experiences themselves. Therefore, everyone felt comfortable, and many key problems were solved in a timely manner. To implement new operating techniques to improve the melting speed, but the air volume of No. 1 furnace was insufficient. After discussion by the masses, it was decided to start by tapping existing potential and making full use of existing wind power. They cooperated with mud workers and repair workers to block the loopholes everywhere with asbestos and white mud. At the same time, unnecessary air pipes and valves were removed, shortening the air supply route to ensure that the air was delivered to the furnace. They braved the high temperature of several hundred degrees to maintain the air vents, keeping all 18 air vents round and bright, so that the hot air concentrated on blowing into the very center of the furnace. In this way, the air volume emitted by the four small fans was equivalent to that of six. After a period of hard work, the melting rate of No. 1 furnace rapidly increased from about ten tons per hour to more than fifteen tons.

	Eighteen Partners, One Heart

To conscientiously implement the new technical operating principles, it is necessary to make everyone have a high degree of consciousness and communist cooperation, and correctly implement the new operating methods. Here, in addition to the technical operation itself, what is more important is to carry out in-depth and meticulous ideological work to make the entire furnace as united as one person. To do in-depth and meticulous ideological work, it is not enough to rely on a few leading cadres; we must rely on everyone to do it. Therefore, the Party organization first mobilized Party members, Youth League members, furnace leaders, and other backbone elements to learn how to do ideological work. Because Party members, Youth League members, and activists played a core role, a lively situation of mutual unity, masses doing ideological work, and masses doing mass work quickly emerged on No. 1 furnace. Everyone was united with the furnace leader, and the 18 people were twisted into one rope.

	Communist Cooperation Shines

To enable the iron melting furnace to overcome technical barriers and achieve high yield, high quality, and long life, it is not enough to rely solely on the 18 people on the iron melting furnace to form one heart; it is also necessary for material transport, slag transport, charging, hot air, furnace building, repair, and other links to closely cooperate, and to unite the hundreds of workers of dozens of types of work related to the iron melting furnace, forming one heart. Therefore, the workers on No. 1 furnace further proposed a slogan: "Not only a fighting team, but also a propaganda team and a work team." Under the leadership of the Party, they went to various types of work related to the iron melting furnace to do propaganda work. They went to the material yard, to the small locomotives, and wherever they went, they did propaganda, talked about the situation, talked about the tasks, and mobilized forces from all sides to support the iron melting furnace and better serve the iron melting furnace. Originally, the furnace front workers only wanted other types of work to serve them, but now the 18 people have become a "work team," taking the initiative to care for the workers of other types of work and serve them. If the iron material could not keep up, they ran to help push the material carts; if slag removal was too late, they helped to remove the slag…. Wherever there were difficulties, they went to support; wherever it was most difficult, they went to help. Holding high the red banner of communist cooperation, they carried out patient and meticulous work, and finally united the hundreds of workers of dozens of types of work centered on the iron melting furnace to fight for a common goal.

No. 1 iron melting furnace is not only the iron melting furnace of 18 people, but has become the iron melting furnace of hundreds of workers of dozens of types of work. Hundreds of people consciously adhere to their posts, correctly implement the new operating methods, and protect the furnace as if they were protecting their own eyes. A moving scene of communist large-scale cooperation has been formed. The workers on the hot air furnace, like treating a child, often go to the iron melting furnace to "measure its temperature"; the workers on the material yard often go to the iron melting furnace to measure the material line to see if its stomach is full. Wang Suqin, a female worker in the lime workshop, patiently processed lime hammer by hammer, sifting out the powder with a sieve, and insisted on "processing coarse grains finely" for the furnace…. Such people who work hard, are not afraid of difficulties, and are for the sake of the overall situation can often be seen around the entire furnace.

The workers of the No. 1 iron melting furnace of the Second Converter Workshop of the Shanghai No. 3 Steel Plant and the workers of other types of work surrounding No. 1 furnace, with this revolutionary ambition and high degree of consciousness and high communist style, steadily and step by step overcame unfavorable material conditions and overcame the numerous difficulties in the advance, and made outstanding achievements. This fact once again eloquently proves that the subjective initiative of people is the decisive factor in the development of things.

    政治挂帅　钢铁增产	本报驻上海记者
    上海钢铁战线上升起了一面鲜艳的红旗——上海第三钢铁厂第二转炉车间一号化铁炉。它在一个生产周期中，平均小时熔化铁水十九点六吨，最高的班达到二十二吨，炉子寿命达到二百八十一炉，熔化率和炉龄都比一般炉子高一半以上，脱硫效果达到64％，也超过了一般炉子的水平，成为全国第一个高产、优质、长寿的大型化铁炉。
    一号炉的设备条件和技术力量并不比其它炉子好。但是，由于车间领导坚持政治挂帅，充分依靠群众来加强政治思想工作，使人人有高度的革命自觉，各工段、各工种大协作，上下一心，坚持贯彻新的技术操作方针，因此，突破了技术关，总结出一套宝贵的政治思想工作和生产技术上的经验。
        政治上炉前
    还在两个月以前，为适应化铁炉技术改造而开始推行新的一套技术操作方针时，第二转炉车间化铁炉的工人们就提出取消一个炉子分割为三班的组织形式，要求三班合作“包开炉子”，以炉子为单位组织生产，以便更好地加强共产主义协作，同心协力把炉子保护好。车间和工厂的领导大力支持了群众的这一要求，实行“包炉制”，同时还决定把炉子上的热风路线、料线、铁料、渣料等三线、三料的管理权力，也同时下放给每只炉子的工人自己管理，以便领导干部腾出更多时间深入生产第一线，和工人同劳动、同商量，解决生产关键问题。这一决定，成为车间的一件大事，大大调动了工人群众的积极性。决定一传出，半日之间，几座设备比较好的炉子，一下都被“包”掉了，一号炉却冷冷清清，没人“包”它。
    难道“老爷炉”不能改变么？值大夜班的化铁炉工段青年班工人，半夜上班时一合计，向总支申请包下了一号炉。但是，这个班的十八个人中，并不是人人都是信心很足的。有人瞧了瞧一号炉的那副老态，泄气地说：“包了这只‘老爷炉’倒霉了！”这时，党总支书记来到炉前，鼓励大家要有革命的志气，真正的英雄是在斗争中产生的，只要我们有决心，有信心，一定能够把“老爷炉”改造好。总支书记向群众表示决心，一定和大家一道干，把一号炉作为“试验田”，一定要把“老爷炉”变为红旗炉。党的支持，给一号炉工人很大的鼓舞。有的说“有党在炉前，我们胆子就大了。”有的说：“炉子老爷不怕，只要我们的思想不老爷，只要十八个人一条心，就能叫老爷炉恢复青春”。不久，车间里为了迅速地掌握大型化铁炉的操作规律，决定搞试验炉。有人主张搞三号炉，因为三号炉设备好。也有人主张搞二号炉，因为二号炉技术力量强。但党总支和支部支持一号炉，认为一号炉工人志气高，人的主观能动作用是决定因素。只要坚持政治挂帅，充分依靠群众，发挥群众的自觉性和创造性，就能创造奇迹。决定一号炉为车间的试验炉以后，党总支书记和团总支书记就到一号炉上去讲形势、讲任务、讲试验炉的意义，和群众一起攻关键。党总支和支部的领导干部经常参加工人的班前班后会议，把过去那种“班前会领导布置任务、班后会群众做检查”的方式，改为工人群众自己提问题、出主意、议论问题、总结经验。因此，人人心情舒畅，许多关键问题都得到了及时解决。要实行新的操作技术来提高熔化速度，但是一号炉的风量不够。经过群众讨论，决定从发挥现有潜力着手，充分利用现有风力。他们和泥工、检修工合作，用石棉、白泥把各处漏洞堵住，同时，把不必要的风管、阀门拆去，缩短了送风路线，保证把风都送到炉子里去。他们冒着几百度高温坚持通风眼，保持了十八只风眼只只圆亮，使热风集中吹到了炉内的正中间。这样，四只小风机发出的风量就抵上六只用。经过一个时期的努力，一号炉熔化率迅速由原来的每小时十吨左右上升到十五吨以上。
      十八个伙伴一条心
    认真贯彻新的技术操作方针，必须使每一个人都有高度的自觉性和共产主义协作精神，正确地执行新的操作方法。这里，除了技术操作本身外，更重要的，是进行深入细致的思想工作，使整个炉子团结得像一个人一样。要做深入细致的思想工作，单靠几个领导干部是不行的，必须依靠大家来做。因此党组织首先动员党员、团员、炉长等骨干分子学会做思想工作。由于党员、团员和积极分子起了核心作用，一号炉上迅速出现了一个相互团结，群众做思想工作、群众做群众工作的生动活泼的局面。大家和炉长团结在一起，十八个人拧成了一股绳。
    共产主义协作光芒四射
    要化铁炉过技术关，做到高产、优质、长寿，仅仅依靠化铁炉上十八个人结成一条心，还是不够的，还要运料、运渣、加料、热风、砌炉、检修等各个环节紧密配合，还要将与化铁炉有关的几十个工种的几百个工人团结起来，结成一条心。因此，一号炉上的工人们进一步提出一个口号：“既是战斗队，又是宣传队、工作队”。他们在党的领导下，到跟化铁炉有关的各个工种去做宣传工作。他们到料场上去，到小火车头上去，走到哪里，宣传到哪里，讲形势、讲任务，调动各方面的力量来支援化铁炉，更好地为化铁炉服务。原来炉前工人只要其他工种为他们服务，现在十八个人成为“工作队”主动去关心其他工种的工人，为他们服务。铁料跟不上了，他们跑去帮助推料车；清渣来不及，又帮助去清渣……。哪里有困难，他们就到哪里去支援；哪里最艰苦，就到哪里去帮助。他们高举着共产主义协作的红旗，进行了耐心而细致的工作，终于把以化铁炉为中心的几百个工人都团结起来，为共同的目标而奋斗。
    一号化铁炉，不只是十八个人的化铁炉，而是成为几十个工种几百个工人的化铁炉。几百个人都自觉地坚持岗位，正确地执行新的操作方法，像爱护自己的眼睛一样保护着炉子。形成了一个共产主义大协作的动人场面。热风炉上的工人，像对待孩子一样，经常到化铁炉上为它“量体温”；料场上的工人，经常到化铁炉上来测料线，看它肚子是否吃饱。石灰工场上的女工王素芹，一锤一锤，耐心加工石灰，用筛子筛掉粉末，坚持为炉子“粗粮细作”……。这种为了全局，不辞辛苦，不怕困难的人，在整个炉子的周围常常可以看到。
    上钢三厂第二转炉车间一号化铁炉的工人和围绕一号炉的其他工种工人，就是以这种革命的志气和高度的自觉精神，高度的共产主义风格，踏踏实实，一步一步地战胜了不利的物质条件，战胜前进中的重重困难，做出了优异的成绩。这一事实，又一次雄辩地证明了，人的主观能动作用，是事物发展的决定性的因素。
