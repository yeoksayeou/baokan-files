    Miscellaneous Poems on a Visit to North Korea
            Zhao Yang
      On the Road from Pyongyang to Wonsan (Tune: Waves Washing Sand)
    Dense rain beats against the car roof,
    The mountain colors are lush and verdant.
    A path winds deep in the thick forest.
    I imagine the hail of bullets back then,
    The hurried military transport.
    The road turns to another strange peak,
    Clouds and mist are hazy.
    I feel as if I am in a painting.
    After the rain, the landscape is infinitely beautiful,
    I stand briefly in the east wind.
      Toasting Madam Park Jae-geun and Mother Gu Bu-ryeok at the Wonsan Banquet
    The deeds of selflessness are still fresh,
    The friendship between China and Korea is forged in blood.
    Today's fine sons and daughters of China,
    Will forever remember the two Korean mothers.
      Viewing the Falls at Bakyeon
    I heard that Scholar Park played the flute and startled the Dragon Palace. The Dragon Maiden admired his nobility and wished to commit herself to him. The flute sound has long faded, only the water gurgles. Standing by the abyss, I gaze at the Dragon Maiden, the flying waterfall cleanses my heart. Even more delightful are the Young Pioneers, singing "The East is Red" in a circle.

    访朝杂咏
            赵扬
      平壤—元山道中（浪淘沙）
    密雨打车篷，
    山色葱茏。
    茂林深处一径通。
    想见当年弹雨下，
    军运倥偬。
    路转又奇峰，
    云雾迷蒙。
    此身疑在画图中。
    雨后江山无限好，
    小立东风。
      元山席上为朴在根夫人、具富力妈妈祝酒
    舍己为人事犹新，
    中朝友谊血凝成。
    即今中国好儿女，
    长忆朝鲜两母亲。
      朴渊观瀑
    闻说朴进士，吹笛惊龙宫。龙女赏高洁，委身愿相从。笛声今已杳，惟余水淙淙。临渊窥龙女，飞瀑涤心胸。更喜红领巾，围唱“东方红”。
