Title: Shameful Slander!

    Shouting "stop thief!" while being the thief and spitting blood at others are the tricks that American imperialism habitually uses to cover up its misdeeds. It has done all kinds of bad things around the world, but it slanders others; it breaks its promises, but it slanders others for violating agreements. Especially when American imperialism's aggressive policies are increasingly hitting snags and the United States is becoming increasingly isolated, this kind of behavior is becoming more and more frequent. The statement made by US State Department Press Officer Ripur on September 9 regarding American prisoners in China and the 1955 Sino-American agreement on the return of civilians is just one recent example.
    Ripur openly demanded that our government release the five American criminals serving sentences in China, saying that these American criminals were being "unjustly imprisoned," and attacked our government for violating its "solemn guarantees made five years ago." This is really doing everything possible to reverse black and white.
    There are indeed some American prisoners in China. There were forty of them before the Sino-American ambassadorial talks in 1955, and now there are five. They have all committed serious crimes endangering China's national security, and their crimes are supported by many undeniable ironclad pieces of evidence, which even they themselves have had to confess one by one. It is entirely justified for the Chinese government to arrest, prosecute, and sentence them to imprisonment in accordance with its own judicial procedures. The gentlemen of the U.S. State Department should know that the days when imperialists could commit crimes in China and go unpunished are long gone. The US government's demand that China release these prisoners is a serious act of interference in China's internal affairs, and the Chinese people will never allow it. If American spies commit crimes in violation of Chinese law, the Chinese government will, of course, punish them according to law.
    China and the United States reached an agreement in 1955 on the return of civilians by both sides. This agreement certainly does not apply to American prisoners in China. Civilians and prisoners cannot be confused, which is the most basic common sense. However, Ripur insisted on saying that the fact that there are still several American prisoners in China means that China has violated the agreement between the two sides on the return of civilians, which is pure fabrication. Of course, American prisoners in China can also return to their country, but only after they have served their sentences or have been released early for good behavior and have regained the status of ordinary civilians. Of the forty American prisoners before the Sino-American talks, thirty-five had already returned to the United States after being released (nineteen of whom were released early), and another voluntarily requested to stay in China after being released, and the Chinese government satisfied his request. In this way, of the original forty American prisoners, only four are still serving sentences in China, plus another American prisoner arrested in 1958, making a total of five. As for the return of ordinary American civilians, it has never been obstructed in any way. On the contrary, the Chinese government has given them all kinds of assistance. This proves that the Chinese side has fully abided by the 1955 Sino-American agreement on the return of civilians.
    It is the United States itself that has violated this agreement. There are tens of thousands of Chinese in the United States who are still prevented from returning to their motherland to reunite with their families. In the past, the US government explicitly prohibited some Chinese students studying in the United States from returning to China. Although it has nominally lifted these bans, it is in fact still doing everything possible to obstruct the return of Chinese people in the United States. Agents of the US Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Immigration Bureau interrogate Chinese people who want to return to their country about why they want to return, threaten them to give up the idea of returning, detain them, intercept them on their way back, and even forcibly send them to mental hospitals. The US government's various shameless and barbaric illegal acts in this regard are simply too numerous to mention. At the beginning of the Sino-American ambassadorial talks, the Chinese side took the initiative to hand over a list of all Americans in China and asked the American side to also hand over a list of Chinese people in the United States. However, the American side has not yet handed over such a list. From this point, it can also be seen that the Chinese side has sincerity in the agreement on the return of civilians by both sides, while the US government is doing its best to undermine it.
    Based on the above, people can clearly see that Ripur's statement on the 9th is a completely shameless slander against the Chinese government. This kind of slander cannot harm a single hair of the great People's Republic of China, but only further exposes the heinous face of American imperialism.

    可耻的诬蔑！	本报评论员
    贼喊捉贼、含血喷人是美帝国主义为掩盖自己的劣行所惯用的伎俩。自己在全世界做尽了坏事，却反诬别人不好；自己背信弃义，却反诬别人违反协议。特别是在美帝国主义的侵略政策日益碰壁，美国的处境日益孤立的时候，这种行径更是层出不穷。9月9日，美国国务院新闻发布官里普关于在中国的美国犯人以及1955年中美两国关于平民回国问题的协议的谈话，只不过是一个最近的例子。
    里普公然要求我国政府释放在中国服刑的五名美国罪犯，说什么这是美国罪犯遭到“毫无理由地囚禁”，并且攻击我国政府违反了自己“在五年前所作的庄严保证”。这真是极尽颠倒黑白的能事。
    在中国的确有一些美国犯人，在1955年中美双方举行大使级会谈前夕有四十人，现在还有五人。他们都犯了危害中国国家安全的严重罪行，他们的犯罪事实有许多不容抵赖的铁证，就连他们自己也不得不一一供认。中国政府按照自己的司法程序将他们逮捕法办，处以徒刑，完全是天经地义的事。美国国务院的老爷们应当知道，帝国主义者在中国犯了法而可以不受惩处的日子早已一去不复返了。美国政府要中国释放这些犯人，是严重地干涉中国的内政的行为，中国人民绝不容许。美国间谍干了违反中国法律的罪行，中国政府当然要依法惩处。
    中美双方曾在1955年达成了关于双方平民回国的协议。这个协议当然不能适用于在中国的美国犯人。平民和犯人不容混同，这本是最简单的常识问题，但是里普却硬把现在还有几个美国犯人在中国这件事说成是中国违反了双方关于平民回国的协议，真是信口雌黄。在中国的美国犯人当然也可以回国，但只能在他服刑期满或者由于行为良好被提前释放而恢复了一般平民的身份以后。中美会谈前夕的四十名美国犯人有三十五人在释放以后（其中有十九人是提前释放的）都已经回到美国，另一人在释放后自愿要求留在中国，中国政府满足了他的要求。这样，原来四十名美犯中现在只有四人尚在中国服刑，加上1958年逮捕的另一名美犯，共五人。至于一般美国平民的回国从来没有受到任何阻挠，相反地中国政府还给了他们种种协助。这就证明，中国方面完全信守1955年中美双方关于平民回国问题的协议。
    违反这个协议的恰恰是美国自己。在美国有数以万计的中国人至今仍受阻不能回到祖国与家人团聚。过去，美国政府曾明令禁止一些中国留美学生回国，现在虽然名义上取消了这些禁令，但事实上仍在百般阻拦在美国的中国人回国。美国联邦调查局和移民局的特务盘问想回国的中国人为什么要回国，威胁他们放弃回国的念头，将他们拘禁起来，把他们从返国途中劫回，甚至硬把他们送入精神病院。美国政府在这方面的种种无耻和野蛮的非法行为实在是不胜枚举。在中美大使级会谈之初，中国方面主动交出了在中国的全部美国人名单，要求美国方面也交出在美国的中国人名单。但是，直到现在美国方面还没有交出这样的名单。从这一点也可以看出，中国方面对双方平民回国的协议抱有诚意，而美国政府则竭力加以破坏。
    根据以上所述，人们可以清楚地看出，里普9日的谈话完全是对中国政府的无耻的诬蔑。这种诬蔑伤害不了伟大的中华人民共和国一根毫毛，只是进一步暴露了美帝国主义穷凶极恶的面目。
