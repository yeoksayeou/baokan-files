    The "Daily Red Production" Movement is a Significant Revolution in Construction Enterprises
    ——The Third Engineering Bureau of the Ministry of Construction Engineering Achieves Continuous "Daily Red Production" for Over 300 Days
    Our correspondent in Gansu Province
    The Third Engineering Bureau of the Ministry of Construction Engineering, which undertakes the main industrial construction tasks in the Lanzhou area, under the brilliant illumination of the Party's General Line for Socialist Construction and under the specific leadership of the Gansu Provincial Party Committee, the Lanzhou Municipal Party Committee, and the Ministry of Construction Engineering, has relied on the broad masses of employees to carry out the "Daily Red Production" movement since November of last year. This has resulted in an excellent situation of continuous "Daily Red Production." By the end of August of this year, the bureau's production had maintained "Daily Red Production" for 305 days. As a result, the phenomenon of uneven construction in the construction industry has been thoroughly broken, replaced by a completely new situation of sustained leap forward, continuous upswing, and high speed, guaranteeing the over-fulfillment of annual, quarterly, monthly, and ten-day production plans.
    The production practice of the past ten months fully demonstrates the enormous superiority and vigorous vitality of the "Daily Red Production" movement. The "Daily Red Production" movement has triggered revolutions in several aspects of construction enterprise management and has become a powerful guarantee for construction enterprises to implement the General Line for Socialist Construction and achieve high speed.
            I. L A W S
    The "Daily Red Production" movement broke the "old law" of "three loosenings and three tightenings" and ushered in a pattern of sustained leap forward, continuous upswing, and high speed.
    Before the Great Leap Forward of 1958, the Third Engineering Bureau had experienced, for various reasons, the phenomenon of "loose in the beginning and tight in the end, idle at first and busy later" and "unhurried at the beginning of the month, steady in the middle, and rushing and grabbing at the end." Since the launch of the "Daily Red Production" movement, the situation has fundamentally changed. The main content of the "Daily Red Production" movement is to ensure the ten-day period based on the day, the month based on the ten-day period, the quarter based on the month, and the year based on the quarter. It requires that each unit and grassroots production team, starting from the first ten-day period of each month and the first day of each ten-day period, must complete more work than the average planned figures for the ten-day period and the day. In this way, the so-called "three loosenings and three tightenings" and the phenomenon of sudden rises and falls in production were naturally broken, replaced by balanced construction and a steady rise day by day, ten-day period by ten-day period, month by month, quarter by quarter, and year by year. This exhibits the following three characteristics:
    First, high speed of production. The cumulative completion of the plan from January to July this year accounted for 74.55% of the annual plan. Comparing the completion of various indicators in the first half of this year with the same period last year, production increased by 102.31%, and the daily output value of construction and installation workers increased by 113.16%. "Daily Red Production" not only enabled the early completion of workload plans, but also greatly accelerated the progress of key projects because the main focus in the daily plan was to ensure key projects first. In the first half of this year, 245 projects were completed and handed over, an increase of 82.87% compared to the same period last year. This high speed is unprecedented for the Third Engineering Bureau.
    Second, balanced ascent and sustained leap forward. Analyzing the actual production situation of the Third Engineering Bureau during this stage, if we take the workload completed in December of last year as 100, the monthly completion volumes from January to July of this year are as follows: 102.04 in January, 107.59 in February, 123.64 in March, 123.87 in April, 124.44 in May, 132.04 in June, and 133.5 in July. Looking at the production situation by ten-day period, the average completion of the monthly plan for the past 24 ten-day periods was 34.74% in the first ten-day period, 33.99% in the middle ten-day period, and 31.27% in the last ten-day period. Therefore, whether viewed from the perspective of day, ten-day period, month, or quarter, there is a balanced and continuous upward trend.
    Third, active balance. The above-mentioned balanced rise is based on active balance. During this period, the Third Engineering Bureau did not use lower targets to achieve a passive balance between construction forces and construction plans. Instead, it mobilized people's subjective initiative through advanced high targets, constantly changing objective conditions and seizing active balance in overcoming difficulties. At the beginning of this year, the bureau's Party committee proposed the guiding principle for the year's production: "Lay the foundation in the first quarter, determine the overall situation in the second quarter, win a complete victory in the third quarter, and cross into '61 (1961)' in the fourth quarter." This slogan is active and serves as the prerequisite for organizing quarterly, monthly, and ten-day production, ensuring the advanced nature of production targets. After the execution of the plan, difficulties arose in terms of building materials and other supplies. With soaring enthusiasm, the broad masses of employees adopted various effective and concrete measures, completing 90% of the task in the first half of the year with only 50% to 60% of the materials (steel 60%, cement 59%, wood 50%). The transport sector also completed the entire scheduled plan with half of its transportation capacity.
          II. I D E O L O G Y
   "If you want daily red, you must first have red thoughts." This is a struggle between the two lines of more, faster, better, and more economical versus less, slower, worse, and more expensive, and it is a struggle to adhere to the Party's General Line.
    In the process of carrying out the "Daily Red Production" movement, the main ideological obstacle encountered by the Third Engineering Bureau was the emphasis on the uniqueness of the construction industry. The "Daily Red Production" movement is the result of a struggle against the "theory of uniqueness" and the victory achieved.
    The construction industry does have its own characteristics: open-air operations, subject to seasonal restrictions; geographically dispersed, with high mobility; numerous types of work, and complex construction objects, making it difficult to organize balance; design and building materials all rely on others, making it difficult to grasp the initiative... Those engaged in construction work should fully recognize these characteristics and organize a comprehensive leap forward. However, if one exaggerates the difficult aspects of these characteristics and regards them as insurmountable unfavorable conditions, one can only passively yield to them and become a prisoner of these so-called "unfavorable conditions," greatly limiting the initiative and creativity of the broad masses of employees, and bringing great harm to production.
    The idea of unilaterally emphasizing the uniqueness of the construction industry and doubting the "Daily Red Production" movement only sees things and not people, negating the role of human subjective initiative. Its essence is to negate high speed. The struggle against these ideas is actually a struggle between the two lines of more, faster, better, and more economical versus less, slower, worse, and more expensive. After repeated study of the Party's General Line, the Party committee of the Third Engineering Bureau deeply realized that in order to achieve a high-speed leap forward in production, it is necessary to persist in carrying out the ideological struggle between the new and the old, so that leaders at all levels and the broad masses of employees hold high the red banner of the General Line and Mao Zedong Thought, eliminate the ideological influence of the "theory of uniqueness," and firmly establish the idea of striving for high speed. At the same time, during the movement, focus closely on three basic issues.
    First, vigorously support the growth of the new thing of "Daily Red Production." To put it simply, the attitude of the bureau's Party committee is to discover it in time, seize it firmly, summarize it, and promote it with all its strength.
    Last year, the Party Central Committee issued instructions on opposing right-leaning tendencies, encouraging efforts, and further carrying out the campaign to increase production and practice economy. In order to concretely implement the instructions of the Central Committee, in addition to strengthening ideological education in this regard for employees on all fronts in the province, the Gansu Provincial Party Committee specifically instructed various production and construction enterprises to carry out the "Four Reds" (daily red, ten-day red, monthly red, and complete red) campaign. The bureau's Party committee conscientiously implemented this instruction, and when conducting the ten-day assessment on November 10, the entire bureau saw the happy event of continuously overfulfilling the daily plan for ten consecutive days, which had never happened before in history. As soon as this new thing appeared, it immediately received the attention and support of the provincial and municipal Party committees, which pointed out that it was a powerful guarantee for organizing high-speed development of construction production, and instructed the bureau's Party committee to earnestly promote the development of this new thing. Therefore, the bureau's Party committee specifically convened a meeting to study and summarize this phenomenon. It was believed that this was an economically and politically significant initiative, a product of the Great Leap Forward, and a revolutionary measure for construction and installation enterprises to catch up with the pace of the Great Leap Forward era. Therefore, it was decided to vigorously consolidate and carry forward the "Daily Red" situation. Subsequently, the entire bureau convened an on-site experience exchange and oath-taking conference for "Daily Red Production." It firmly proposed to guarantee the realization of "Daily Red" in the first quarter of 1960. Subsequently, Party committees at all levels used various occasions and methods to repeatedly emphasize the great significance of "Daily Red Production" and vigorously promoted its comprehensive realization.
    Second, firmly establish the idea of high speed among the broad masses of employees. The idea of striving for high speed and striving for sustained leap forward is the soul of the "Daily Red Production" movement. Without this idea, it is impossible to achieve "Daily Red." Through study and big-character posters and big debates, the broad masses of cadres and leaders criticized the "theory of uniqueness." The workers of the entire bureau also universally launched mass debates on "Can we achieve Daily Red?" and "How to guarantee Daily Red?" Party committee secretaries at all levels also personally convened "Daily Red" symposiums with the participation of veteran workers, technical personnel, and employee representatives, and carried out education on regarding the completion of the daily plan as a concrete action to achieve the Great Leap Forward and achieve high speed, greatly strengthening the sense of responsibility and honor of the employees for achieving "Daily Red."
    Third, correctly treat the relationship between people and things and fully exert the subjective initiative of people. To carry out the "Daily Red Production" movement, it is necessary to overcome many objective material difficulties. Some difficulties are still very prominent. In carrying out political and ideological education for employees, the bureau's Party committee clearly pointed out that it is necessary to correctly treat difficulties and correctly treat the relationship between people and things. On the basis of acknowledging the necessity of objective material conditions, it emphasized fully exerting the subjective initiative of people, believing that this is the fundamental guarantee for overcoming unfavorable factors, organizing active balance, and seizing "Daily Red." The resounding slogans put forward in the ideological debate were: "Break negative waiting, establish active striving; break static balance, establish active balance," "Work requires time, we must actively strive for time; work requires conditions, we must actively create conditions; work has difficulties, we must actively overcome difficulties." Through big debates and continuous comparative education with practical examples, the employees of the entire bureau established the idea of self-reliance and striving for initiative.
          III. LEADERSHIP METHODS
    Leadership goes deep into the front line of production, analyzes the situation in a timely manner, grasps both hands simultaneously with the idea of continuous revolution, and carries out mass movements on a large scale to ensure that the "Daily Red Production" movement is both vigorous and down-to-earth.
    To organize and realize "Daily Red Production," having a "red" ideology alone is not enough. It is also necessary to improve enterprise management, improve leadership style, and working methods to adapt to the requirements of the movement.
    First, leaders at all levels went deep into the front line of production and formulated a complete system for going deep into the front line. In directing production, they changed the old practice of simply relying on one level managing another and implemented a method of grasping the grassroots and getting to the bottom of things. The specific practices of leaders going deep into the front line are: combining cursory observation with detailed investigation. In using this method, leaders at all levels mainly understand the situation and solve problems through daily visits to construction sites, holding telephone conferences, staying at designated points, organizing inspection teams, holding on-site meetings, and working alongside workers, using the methods of seeing, listening, asking, talking, and feeling. Recently, the bureau's Party committee, with reference to the spirit of the "two-five system," has made specific regulations on the leadership methods of the bureau, companies, engineering offices, grassroots teams and groups, and various functional departments, as well as the system for going deep into the front line of production, requiring strict implementation. At the same time, it also comprehensively launched the "one line (going deep into the front line of production), two reds (ideological red, production red), three passes (getting through the materials, transportation, and earthwork passes), and four togethers (eating, living, laboring, and discussing with the masses)" movement, which focused on emphasizing going deep into the front line to improve leadership style and "Daily Red Production." In this way, leaders can discover and solve problems in a timely manner, preventing the entire movement from being hindered because some problems are not solved.
    Second, analyze the situation in a timely manner and seize "signs." The important responsibility of leading cadres is to analyze the work situation of their departments at any time, so as to have a predictive leadership. To see the situation clearly, it is also necessary to pay attention to grasping "signs." There are two types of "signs": signs of new things and dangerous signs. In order to promote leading cadres to grasp the essence of problems after going deep into the front line, discover problems, and solve problems, the "opening red" was won in January, and the situation was excellent in February. The factory Party committee promptly proposed the fighting call of surpassing last winter's actual production this spring, creating a new record of high output in spring in the history of the entire bureau. The bureau's Party committee analyzes the ideological situation and production situation every ten days, every month, and every quarter, and makes correct judgments and corresponding measures. Recently, it has further promoted the continuous analysis of the situation as the primary responsibility of Party committees at all levels and stipulated it as a system.
    Third, concretely apply the spirit of continuous revolution and implement the leadership method of "grasping both hands simultaneously." Everything includes two opposing and unified aspects. "Grasping both hands" means grasping the two opposites of things, being farsighted, recognizing the situation, making preparations in advance, and striving for the initiative. The center of "grasping both hands" is: grasping production with one hand and grasping preparation with the other. More specifically, it is grasping the production of the day, the ten-day period, the month, and the quarter with one hand, and grasping the preparation for the next day, the next ten-day period, the next month, and the next quarter with the other. The guiding ideology on this issue is: in the first and middle ten days of the month, focus on grasping the production of the current month; in the last ten days, focus on grasping the preparation for the next month; at the beginning of the month, grasp the "opening red" to lay the foundation; in the middle ten days, grasp tightly to complete the monthly plan. This will free up hands to focus on preparation in the last ten days and create conditions for the next ten days in terms of materials and construction surface. Practice has proven that grasping both hands simultaneously is of particular importance for achieving "Daily Red Production." At present, the entire bureau has universally established the guiding ideology of grasping the present, preparing for the next step, and observing the future development trend, and it has become a system and conscious action of workers' teams and groups.
      In addition to grasping production and preparation, "grasping both hands" also implements grasping the workload with one hand and grasping the image progress with the other; grasping key projects with one hand and grasping general projects with the other; grasping the main structure with one hand and grasping the decoration project with the other; grasping the start of work with one hand and grasping the finishing touches with the other. In addition, it is also manifested in grasping production with one hand and grasping life with the other; grasping construction and installation with one hand and grasping diversified operations with the other; grasping the construction site with one hand and grasping the offices with the other. This ensures that the work has both key points and generalities, promoting the comprehensive leap forward of various tasks.
    Fourth, adhere to the method of carrying out mass movements on a large scale. In organizing the realization of "Daily Red Production," Party committees at all levels in the entire bureau regard closely relying on the masses and widely implementing the mass line as the premise and foundation of all work. They also conscientiously adopt the methods of large-scale publicity, large-scale mobilization (clarify the goals of the struggle and carry out ideological education), large-scale competitions, large-scale summaries, large-scale evaluations (mobilize positive factors and summarize advanced things), large-scale rewards, large-scale victory celebrations (encourage morale and strengthen confidence), large-scale insertion of red flags, and large-scale establishment of pacesetters (establish outstanding models and point out learning models), guiding the mass movement from one climax to another with full enthusiasm.
          IV. M E A S U R E S
    Adapt to the new productive forces, carry out enterprise management revolution, develop diversified operations, solve material problems through self-reliance, vigorously promote the style of mutual assistance and cooperation between Party A and Party B, and mobilize all positive factors.
    In order to ensure "Daily Red Production," the entire bureau has adopted a series of revolutionary management measures, the main ones of which are as follows.
    (I) Carry out enterprise management reform to adapt to production needs
    "Daily Red Production" marks that the productive forces have developed to a new stage, and the old set of management methods and rules and regulations, and other superstructure, must be changed accordingly. To this end, the Third Engineering Bureau carried out a major reform in enterprise management through the "Daily Red" movement.
    (1) In terms of plan management, implement the "two-up and two-down" and "five-deliveries and five-determinations" systems centered on the daily plan and implementing the mass line.
    Plan management is the central link of enterprise management. To adapt to the needs of the "Daily Red Production" movement, the entire bureau changed the past system of parallel management of quarterly, monthly, ten-day, and daily plans by various levels of organizations, and replaced it with the quarterly and monthly plans as a phased battle plan and the ten-day and daily plans as a battle plan in the entire battle. On the premise of guaranteeing the battle plan, the battle plan can be flexibly adjusted as necessary according to changes in conditions, thereby giving full play to the role of the plan in guiding production and achieving the goal of accumulating small victories into big victories.
    When preparing the monthly plan, the "two-up and two-down" system of coming from the masses and going to the masses is adopted. That is, first, the planning departments of each company go deep into the construction site to understand the situation, and propose planning indicators based on the requirements of the bureau and the actual situation, report them to the bureau, and issue them to each engineering office as recommended indicators (one up and one down); each engineering office implements them layer by layer in a "three-in-one" manner based on this recommended indicator, and arranges them specifically, reports them to the company for approval, and after the company approves them, it reports them to the bureau for record and issues them to the engineering office for execution in formal documents (two up and two down). In terms of ten-day and daily plans, in accordance with the spirit of "two-up and two-down," the company still uniformly manages the indicators and decentralizes the specific arrangement and review authority, which is prepared by the production team and group under the principle of ensuring the ten-day period on the basis of the day and ensuring the month on the basis of the ten-day period, and is approved by the engineering office. This plan management method, which combines unification and decentralization and integrates the upper and lower levels, not only makes the plan have a broad mass base, but also strengthens the accuracy of the plan and its guidance to production, making the daily plan a product that combines centralized leadership and large-scale mass movement. After the plan is prepared, it begins to be explained to the masses around the requirements of technical management, quota management, material management, and cost management. In terms of content, the "five deliveries" are implemented, namely, delivering tasks, delivering difficulties, delivering measures, delivering operating procedures, and delivering safety. In terms of methods, level-by-level explanations and layer-by-layer contracting are adopted. The workers of the production group discuss according to these "bottoms," and then use the "five determinations" system of determining people, determining time, determining quality, determining quantity, and determining responsibilities to ensure the completion of the production plan. In this way, everyone is made to manage the plan, everyone has a clear understanding, and the responsibility is assigned to the group and to the individual. Every worker knows where to do what this month, this ten-day period, and today, and where to do what tomorrow. After the broad masses grasp the plan, "everyone shares the burden," which can give full play to the strength and wisdom of the masses and do everything possible to ensure the completion of the plan.
      (2) In terms of construction management, carefully feel, frequently schedule, and firmly grasp.
    In terms of construction management, the construction management method of carefully feeling, frequently scheduling, and firmly grasping has been widely promoted.
    Carefully feeling means understanding the situation and knowing it well. It mainly involves understanding the construction projects, material supply, technical strength, construction preparations, existing problems, Party A and subcontracting situations, etc. By carefully feeling, we can grasp the actual situation and strive for the initiative. All leading cadres and production management personnel must know which team and which group are doing what work in which construction number, to what extent, what problems exist, what materials are placed where, when they can be used, what is lacking, and when it must be resolved. Some engineering offices even know how many nails are in each group and where they are placed.
    Frequent scheduling mainly involves scheduling construction projects, finding key points and main attack directions; scheduling construction problems, finding key and weak links. The specific practices are: scheduling key points, scheduling images, scheduling the start and end of work, scheduling the connection of processes, scheduling labor, scheduling materials, scheduling machinery, etc., and solving them step by step according to the size, importance, urgency, and other factors of the problems. Since the Great Leap Forward, the entire bureau has adopted the method of establishing "three lines of defense" in terms of strategic deployment according to the characteristics of the changeable nature of the site. That is, the key projects that must be guaranteed are listed as the first line, the projects that may be strived for are listed as the second line, and the projects that use little or no major materials are listed as the third line. When the material supply is sufficient, the first line is ensured and the second line is fought hard, or the first line is ensured and the third line is attacked fiercely. This can advance or retreat, and can maximize the initiative under favorable and unfavorable situations.
    Firmly grasping means taking the grasping of the daily plan as the center and implementing "four grasps and four non-relaxations." That is, grasp the production of the current day without relaxing the preparation for the next day; grasp the workload indicators without relaxing the image progress; grasp the main project without relaxing the finishing project; grasp the key project without relaxing the general project. In "four grasps and four non-relaxations," grasping the production of the current day and the preparation for the next day is the basic link. The company and the engineering office grasp three times a day: in the morning, they grasp the construction arrangement and labor combination; at noon, they grasp the image progress and existing problems; in the evening, they grasp the actual production results and the arrangement for the next day. The engineering office grasps deeper and more meticulously. The specific practices are: one is to grasp the three visits in the morning (contact the materials department to ask about material supply, contact the processing department to ask about component matching, and ask for instructions to solve technical problems); the second is to grasp the three inspections on site at noon (project progress, quality and safety, and next-step preparation); and the third is to grasp the three dispatches at the afternoon meeting (materials, labor, and machinery). The workers' team and group also grasp three things: one is to grasp task assignment and construction preparation, the second is to grasp labor combination and process connection, and the third is to grasp competition and evaluation.
      (3) In terms of statistics, implement a rapid forecast system.
    The statistical system is one of the important contents of enterprise management. With the advent of "Daily Red Production," the production situation has developed rapidly, and leaders at all levels urgently need to grasp and understand the production situation in a timely manner. The original practice of regarding statistics as only the actual record of the end of production activities, and providing the leadership with the daily production situation only on the next day, has been far from meeting the requirements of "Daily Red Production." Therefore, through practical exploration, the entire bureau has established a daily progress rapid forecast statistical system. The specific practices are to advance the time of daily reporting statistics to 12:00 noon on the same day. At the production meeting held at this time, based on the actual completion of the first half of the day and the concrete arrangements of the grassroots production supervisor for the production of the second half of the day, the discussion is finalized on the spot, which is used both as the basis for the competition among the teams and groups and as the statistics for the numbers to ensure the completion of the day, and the progress daily report is issued in advance; at the same time, according to the grassroots arrangements for the next day, the numbers to be completed on the next day are predicted, which is called the "tomorrow's plan," which has become a complete system that combines statistics, planning, and production. In this way, under normal circumstances, leaders at the bureau level can understand the completion situation of the day and foresee the possible completion situation of tomorrow before getting off work on the same day, providing realistic data for analyzing and studying production guidance.
    After a long period of practice, it has been proven that rapid forecast statistics have many benefits. The main benefits are:
    First, it enables leaders to work without losing the opportunity and to maintain the initiative.
    Second, it gives full play to the role of statistics in promoting production. Since the forecast number and the evaluation basis number are unified, the forecast number includes a certain subjective effort and striving factor, which actually plays a role in promoting production.
    Third, it is conducive to improving work style and strengthening grassroots management. In order to implement and realize the forecast numbers, it promotes grassroots management personnel to carefully understand the situation and follow the mass line.
    This method of changing the original record after the end of production activities to advance statistics and forecasts during production is a major reform in statistical work that highly values people's subjective initiative and has profound political significance, and is the crystallization of large-scale mass movement in statistical work.
    (4) In terms of labor organization, improve the combination and increase the combat effectiveness of the grassroots production team and group.
    The production team (group) is the most basic production organization of the construction enterprise, and is the place where the broad masses of employees are frequently active. The enterprise's production tasks and all major tasks must be finally realized through the team and group. The quality of the team and group's work directly determines the fate of "Daily Red." In order to enhance the combat effectiveness of the team and group, the Third Engineering Bureau first paid attention to the allocation of political backbones in the team and group. The bureau's Party committee decided to establish a Party branch in the mixed production team and a Party group in the production group, and to form a core group composed of the group leaders of the Party, government, labor union, and Youth League groups and individual veteran technicians to lead the production work of the group. At the same time, the worker management system of several personnel under the leadership of the production group leader is implemented (the several personnel are plan statisticians, labor wage personnel, quality and safety personnel, material personnel, cost accounting personnel, publicity personnel, etc., which can be more or less depending on actual needs), and everyone is tried to be made a member, to realize everyone's participation in management, strengthen all aspects of production management, and give full play to everyone's role. In this way, the responsible cadres of the grassroots team and group generally feel that the work is easier to do. They reflected that now "there is responsibility on the shoulders, power in the hands, clarity in the mind, and strength in the body!"
  (II) Develop diversified operations, vigorously promote conservation and substitution, and solve the problem of building materials through self-reliance
    In order to make the supply of building materials meet the needs of the leap forward situation, the Third Engineering Bureau adhered to the spirit of active balance and determined the principle of "70% conditions and 30% striving." The broad masses of employees also put forward the slogan of "find materials ourselves if there are no materials, and make machines ourselves if there are no machines." This spirit of actively taking responsibility for the country's construction undertakings, on the one hand, promoted the development of the movement to engage in new technologies, new materials, and new structures, conserve and substitute building materials, and on the other hand, promoted the development of diversified operations, resulting in a climax of engaging in diversified operations on a large scale. In 1959, the entire bureau fully incorporated diversified operations production into the plan, so that it would continue to develop at high speed.
    Under the guidance of the principle of self-reliance and combining indigenous and foreign methods, the entire bureau began to establish diversified operations in the second half of 1958. After more than a year of rectification, consolidation, and continued development, it has achieved significant results. Up to now, the entire bureau has 54 large and small backbone factories belonging to raw material production, machinery manufacturing, processing components, and repair, and has initially formed a diversified operations industrial network that serves construction. In 1959, the main products produced reached more than 60 kinds, with an output value of more than 35 million yuan. Among them, substitutes such as steel, cement, and wood have been partially self-sufficient, and mineral wool, oil felt paper, refractory bricks, electrodes, calcium carbide, etc. have all achieved self-sufficiency.
    At the same time, the entire bureau vigorously engaged in design innovation and design revolution centered on new technologies, new materials, and new structures, focusing on prestressed reinforced concrete structures to replace ordinary reinforced concrete or steel structures, and trial-produced and used gypsum mineral wool cement, silicate large-scale roofing panels, artificial marble, grass fiberboard and other 10 items and 35 kinds of new materials. Thereby using less or no important building materials such as steel, cement, and wood. In addition, resolutely and thoroughly implement the past set of material conservation measures. In the first half of the year, more than 3,000 tons of steel, more than 13,000 tons of cement, and more than 9,800 cubic meters of wood were saved.
    At present, the diversified operations of the Third Engineering Bureau are still in the stage of continuous development, and the quantity of materials produced is not very large. However, the practice during this period has proved that it is indeed the fundamental direction for solving material problems and a long-term policy that must be adhered to for high-speed construction of socialism.
  (III) Vigorously promote the style of mutual assistance and cooperation between Party A and Party B, mobilize the positive factors of all parties, and ensure high-speed construction
    Communist collaboration is one of the basic characteristics of socialist production relations. In the collaboration between Party A and Party B, the Third Engineering Bureau particularly grasped an important link, which is to actively undertake Party A's difficulties, be bold and responsible, and uniformly adjust and centrally use building materials, mobilize material potential, and ensure high-speed construction. Under the correct principle of separate accounting and special material use stipulated by the central government, the materials of various Party A were centrally managed, uniformly adjusted, supplied in complete sets, and centrally used to solve the problem of uneven material arrival time and variety specifications, ensure the high speed of construction, and ensure the completion of key construction tasks. According to incomplete statistics, in the first half of the year alone, 2,033 tons of steel, 20,890 tons of cement, and more than 2,480 cubic meters of wood were mutually adjusted and used for Party A, ensuring the early commissioning of new construction projects such as Lanzhou Refinery and Lanzhou Chemical Plant. At the same time, with the approval of the higher-level Party committee, the Third Engineering Bureau and Party A jointly formed a construction site Party committee on large-scale construction sites, and established a construction site headquarters under it to uniformly lead construction, uniformly use the human and material resources of Party A and Party B, which the masses called "two forces twisted into one rope," "one team, one institution, one plan, and two accounts," which guaranteed the relationship of mutual assistance and cooperation from the organizational system. The result of this is that the construction department has grasped the initiative of material supply, mobilized the potential of materials, and further exerted the enthusiasm of the masses, which has played an important role in solving the shortage of raw materials and realizing "Daily Red Production."
    The achievements of the Third Engineering Bureau in carrying out the "Daily Red Production" movement prove that "Daily Red Production" is an inevitable product of implementing the Party's General Line of building socialism in a more, faster, better, and more economical way, an objective requirement and inevitable product under the new situation of comprehensive and sustained leap forward in production, and a result of combining mass movement and strengthening enterprise management. This series of achievements reflects a fundamental line in our enterprise management; the basic content of this line is: high speed, continuous revolution, and reliance on the masses. With this line and adhering to its implementation, enterprise management work can be done more and more meticulously, promoting the continuous improvement of enterprise management level, promoting the revolution of the entire enterprise management, and opening up broad roads for fully exerting people's subjective initiative and striving for greater leap forward.

    生产日日红运动是建筑企业的一项重要革命
    ——建筑工程部第三工程局连续三百多天实现生产日日红的经验
    本报驻甘肃省记者
    承建兰州地区主要工业建设任务的建筑工程部第三工程局，从去年11月起到现在，在党的社会主义建设总路线光辉照耀下，在中共甘肃省委、兰州市委和建筑工程部的具体领导下，依靠广大职工群众，开展了生产日日红运动，使生产上出现了连续日日红的大好形势。到本年8月底为止，全局生产已经保持了三百零五天日日红。结果，彻底打破了建筑业施工不均衡的现象，代之以完全崭新的持续跃进、不断高涨、高速度的局面，保证了年、季、月、旬生产计划均超额完成。
    过去十个月的生产实践，充分显示出生产日日红运动的巨大优越性和旺盛生命力。日日红生产运动，引起建筑企业管理上若干方面的革命，成为建筑企业贯彻执行社会主义建设总路线和赢得高速度的一个有力的保证。
            一、规　律
    生产日日红运动打破了“三松三紧”的“旧规律”；出现了持续跃进、不断高涨、高速度的规律。
    第三工程局在大跃进的1958年以前，由于各种原因，生产上曾出现了“前松后紧，先闲后忙”和“月初不慌不忙，月中稳稳当当，月末连突带抢”的现象。自从开展生产日日红运动后，情况有了根本的改变。生产日日红运动的主要内容是：日保旬，旬保月，月保季，季保年，它要求每个单位和基层生产队组，从每月的第一旬、每旬的第一天起，所完成的工作量都必须多于旬、日的平均计划数字。这样，就极其自然地打破了所谓“三松三紧”和生产骤升骤降现象，代之以均衡施工和逐日逐旬逐月逐季逐年的稳步上升。这表现出下述三个特点：
    第一，生产的高速度。今年1月到7月累计完成计划数占到全年计划的74.55％。以今年上半年各项指标的完成情况和去年同期比较：生产增长了102.31％，建筑安装工人日产值增长113.16％。生产日日红不仅使工作量计划提前完成，而且由于每日计划中，主攻方向首先是保证重点工程，因此使重点工程进度也大大加快。今年上半年交工项目达二百四十五项，比去年同期增长了82.87％。这种高速度是第三工程局前所未有的。
    第二，均衡上升，持续跃进。从第三工程局这个阶段的实际生产情况来分析，如以去年12月完成的工作量为一百，则今年1至7月逐月完成量为：1月份一百零二点零四，2月份一百零七点五九，3月份一百二十三点六四，4月份一百二十三点八七，5月份一百二十四点四四，6月份一百三十二点零四，7月份一百三十三点五。再从旬的生产情况来看，过去的二十四个旬，每旬平均完成工作量的状况是：上旬平均完成月计划的34.74％，中旬平均完成月计划的33.99％，下旬平均完成月计划的31.27％。所以，无论从日、旬、月、季来看，都是均衡地持续不断上升的。
    第三，积极平衡。上述这种均衡上升是建立在积极平衡的基础之上的。第三工程局在此期间，并不是用较低的指标来获得施工力量和施工计划间的消极的平衡，而是通过先进的高指标来调动人们的主观能动性，使之不断地改变客观条件，在克服困难中夺取积极的平衡。今年初工程局党委对全年生产提出的指导原则是：“一季打基础，二季定大局，三季获全胜，四季跨六一（1961年）”。这个口号是积极的，它是组织季月和旬日生产的前提，保证了生产指标的先进性。执行计划以后，出现了建筑材料等物资方面的困难，广大职工群众以冲天的干劲，采取各种有效具体措施，使上半年仅用五分到六分材料（钢材60％，水泥59％，木材50％）就完成了十分任务，运输方面也以二分之一的运力完成预定的全部计划。
          二、思　想
   “要想日日红，必先思想红”这是一场多快好省与少慢差费两条路线之间的斗争，是坚持党的总路线的斗争。
    第三工程局在开展生产日日红运动的过程中，遇到的主要思想障碍是：强调建筑业特殊。日日红运动就是在与“特殊论”之间进行斗争并取得胜利的结果。
    建筑业是有本身的特点的：露天作业，受季节限制；地域分散，流动性大；工种繁多，施工对象复杂，不易组织平衡；设计和建筑材料都要依靠别人，不易掌握主动权……。从事建筑工作的人，应该充分认识这些特点，组织全面跃进。但是，如果夸大了这些特点的困难方面，把它们看成是不可克服的不利条件，那就只好消极地迁就它，成为这些所谓“不利条件”的俘虏。大大限制广大职工群众的积极性和创造性的发挥，给生产带来很大的危害。
    片面强调建筑业的特殊和怀疑日日红运动的思想，是只见物不见人，否定人的主观能动作用的。其实质是否定高速度。同这些思想的斗争，实际上就是多快好省与少慢差费之间的两条路线的斗争。第三工程局党委经过对党的总路线的反复学习，深刻地体会到：要使生产高速度地跃进，就必须坚持进行新与旧的思想斗争，使各级领导到广大职工群众高举总路线和毛泽东思想的红旗，肃清“特殊论”的思想影响，巩固地树立力争高速度的思想。同时，在运动中，紧紧抓住三个基本问题。
    第一，大力支持日日红这个新生事物的成长。局党委的态度，简括说来就是及时发现，狠狠抓住，进行总结，全力推广。
    去年，党中央发出了关于反右倾、鼓干劲，进一步开展增产节约运动的指示，中共甘肃省委为具体贯彻中央的指示，除了对全省各个战线职工加强这方面的思想教育外，还特别指示各生产和建筑企业，开展“四红（日红、旬红、月红、满堂红）运动”。局党委认真地贯彻了这一指示，到11月10日进行旬评比时，全局出现了历史上从未有过的连续十天日日超额完成日计划的喜事。这个新的事物一出现，立刻得到省委和市委的重视和支持，指出这是组织建筑生产高速度发展的有力保证，指示局党委认真促进这一新事物的发展。局党委因此专门召开会议对这一现象进行研究和总结。认为这是一项富有经济和政治意义的创举，是大跃进的产物，也是建筑安装企业赶上大跃进时代步伐的革命措施。因而决定大力巩固和发扬光大日日红的局面。接着，全局召开了日日红现场经验交流誓师大会。坚定地提出保证实现1960年首季日日红。随后，各级党委利用各种场合和各种方式，反复强调生产日日红的伟大意义，并力促其全面实现。
    第二，在广大职工群众中巩固地树立高速度思想。力争高速度、力争持续跃进的思想是生产日日红运动的灵魂，没有这种思想要实现日日红是不可能的。通过学习和大字报大辩论，广大干部和领导人员批判了“特殊论”思想，全局的工人群众又普遍开展了“能不能实现日日红”和“如何保证日日红”的群众性大辩论；各级党委书记还亲自召开有老工人、技术人员和职工代表参加的日日红座谈会，进行了把完成日计划当作实现大跃进、实现高速度的具体行动的教育，大大加强了职工群众对实现日日红的责任心和荣誉感。
    第三，正确对待人与物的关系，充分发挥人的主观能动作用。开展生产日日红运动，必须克服许多客观的物资方面的困难；有些困难还是很突出的。局党委在向职工群众进行政治思想教育工作中，明确指出必须正确对待困难，正确对待人与物之间的关系，在承认客观物质条件的必要性的基础上，强调充分发挥人的主观能动作用，认为这是克服不利因素，组织积极平衡，夺取日日红的根本保证。在开展思想辩论中提出的响亮口号是：“破消极等待，立主动争取；破静止平衡，立积极平衡”，“工作需要时间，我们要主动争取时间；工作需要条件，我们要主动创造条件；工作存在困难，我们要主动克服困难”。通过大辩论和不断以实际事例的对比教育，全局职工树立了自力更生、力争主动的思想。
          三、领导方法
    领导深入生产第一线，及时分析形势，以不断革命思想两手一齐抓，大搞群众运动，保证日日红运动既轰轰烈烈又扎扎实实。
    组织实现生产日日红，单有红的思想还不行，还必须改进企业管理、改进领导作风和工作方法，来适应运动的要求。
    第一，各级领导干部深入生产第一线，制定了完整的深入第一线制度。在指挥生产中改变单纯依靠一级管一级的旧的作法，实行了抓到基层，一杆子插到底的方法。领导深入第一线的具体作法是：走马观花与下马观花相结合。各级领导干部在运用这一方法中，主要是通过每日深入工地、召开电话会议、蹲点、组织检查团、召开现场会、跟班劳动等形式，以看、听、问、谈、摸的办法了解情况和解决问题。最近，局党委参照“二五制”精神，对从局、公司、工程处到基层队组和各职能处科的领导方法和深入生产第一线等制度，都分别作了具体规定，要求严格执行。同时，并全面开展了以强调深入第一线改进领导作风和生产日日红为中心的“一线（深入生产第一线）二红（思想红、生产红）三关（过好材料、运输、土方关）四同（和群众同吃同住同劳动同商量）”运动。这样，领导就可以及时发现和解决问题，不致因某些问题得不到解决而妨碍整个运动。
    第二，及时分析形势，狠抓“苗头”。领导干部的重要责任是随时分析本部门的工作形势，作到有预见的领导；而要想看清形势，又必须注意抓“苗头”。“苗头”有两种：一种是新生事物苗头，一种是危险的苗头。为促进领导干部深入第一线后能抓住问题的本质，发现问题，解决问题，今年，元月开门红获胜，2月形势极好，厂党委及时提出了今春实产超去冬的战斗号召，创了全局有史以来的春季高产新纪录。局党委每旬每月每季都要对思想情况和生产形势进行分析，并作出正确的判断和相应措施。最近，更把不断分析形势提为各级党委的首要职责，作为制度加以规定。
    第三，具体运用不断革命论的精神，贯彻“两手一齐抓”的领导方法。一切事物都包括着对立的统一的两个方面，“两手抓”就是掌握事物的两个对立面，高瞻远瞩，认清形势，预作准备，力争主动。“两手抓”的中心是：一手抓生产，一手抓准备，更具体地说则是一手抓当日当旬当月当季的生产，一手抓次日次旬次月次季的准备。在这个问题上的指导思想是：上中旬着重抓当月生产，下旬着重抓下月的准备；月初抓开门红奠定基础，中旬紧抓完成全月计划。这就能够腾出手来，在下旬大抓准备，在材料和施工面上为下旬创造条件。实践证明，两手一齐抓，对实现生产日日红有特殊重要的意义。目前，全局普遍树立了狠抓当前、准备下步、眼观今后发展趋势的指导思想，并成为工人队组的制度和自觉行动。
      “两手抓”除抓生产和准备以外，还贯彻了一手抓工作量，一手抓形象进度；一手抓重点工程，一手抓一般工程；一手抓主体结构，一手抓装饰工程；一手抓开工，一手抓收尾等各个方面。此外，还表现在一手抓生产，一手抓生活；一手抓建筑安装，一手抓多种经营；一手抓工地，一手抓科室等等。这就保证了工作既有重点又有一般，促使各项工作比翼齐飞，全面跃进。
    第四，坚持大搞群众运动的方法。全局各级党委在组织实现生产日日红中，把紧密依靠群众广泛贯彻群众路线，作为一切工作的前提和基础；并且认真采取大宣传、大动员（明确斗争目标，进行思想教育）、大竞赛、大总结、大评比（调动积极因素，总结先进事物）、大奖励、大祝捷（鼓励士气、坚定信心）、大插红旗、大树标兵（树立优秀典型，指出学习楷模）的方法，满腔热情地引导着群众运动从一个高潮走向另一个高潮。
          四、措　施
    适应新的生产力，进行企业管理革命，开展多种经营，自力更生地解决材料问题，大兴甲乙双方互助协作之风，调动一切积极因素。
    为了保证生产日日红，全局采取了一系列管理上的革命措施，其中主要的有下述几点。
    （一）适应生产需要，进行企业管理改革
    生产日日红标志着生产力发展到了一个新的阶段，旧的一套管理方法和规章制度等上层建筑，必须相应改变。为此，三工程局通过日日红运动开展了企业管理上的大改革。
    （1）在计划管理方面，实行以日计划为中心和贯彻群众路线的“两上两下”、“五交五定”制度。
    计划管理是企业管理的中心环节，为适应生产日日红运动的需要，全局改变了过去各级组织平行管理季月旬日计划的制度，而代之以把季月计划作为一个阶段的战役计划，把旬日计划作为整个战役中的战斗计划。战斗计划在保证战役计划的前提下，根据条件的变化，可以灵活地进行必要调整，从而充分发挥了计划指导生产的作用，达到了积小胜为大胜的目的。
    在编制月计划时，采取从群众中来到群众中去的“两上两下”制。即首先由各公司计划部门深入工地摸清情况，根据局的要求和实际情况提出计划指标，上报局和下达各工程处，作为建议指标（一上一下）；各工程处根据这个建议指标，以“三结合”方式层层落实，具体安排，上报公司审批，公司审批后，以正式文件报局备案和下达工程处执行（两上两下）。在旬日计划方面，仍然根据“两上两下”精神，由公司统一管理指标，下放具体安排和审查权限，由生产队组在日保旬、旬保月的原则下编制，由工程处审批。这种既统又放，上下结合的计划管理方法，不仅使计划具备了广泛的群众基础，同时也加强了计划的准确性和对生产的指导性，使日计划成为集中领导与大搞群众运动相结合的产物。计划编制后，围绕技术管理、定额管理、料具管理和成本管理等要求，开始向群众交底。在内容上实行“五交”，即交任务、交困难、交措施、交操作规程、交安全。在方法上采取逐级交底，层层包干。生产小组的工人根据这些“底”进行讨论，然后用定人、定时、定质、定量、定责任的“五定”制度，保证生产计划完成。这样即作到了人人管计划，个个心中有数，责任到组到人。每个工人都知道本月本旬和当天应该在什么地方做什么，明天又将在什么地方做什么。广大群众掌握计划以后，“千斤担子众人挑”，这就能充分发挥群众的力量和智慧，千方百计保证计划的完成。
      （2）在施工管理方面，细摸，勤排，狠抓。
    在施工管理方面，普遍推广了细摸、勤排、狠抓的施工管理方法。
    细摸，就是要了解情况，做到心中有数。主要是摸工程项目、材料供应、技术力量、施工准备、存在问题、甲方与分包情况等等，通过细摸掌握实际，争取主动。凡是领导干部与管理生产人员，都要知道哪个队哪个组在哪个工号干什么活，干到了什么程度，存在什么问题，有些什么材料放在什么地方，什么时候能用上，缺什么，必须什么时候解决。有的工程处甚至知道哪个小组的钉子有多少，放在什么地方。
    勤排，主要是工程项目排队，找出重点及主攻方向；施工问题排队，找出关键及薄弱环节。具体作法是：排重点、排形象、排开工收尾、排工序衔接、排劳动力、排材料、排机械等，根据问题的大小轻重缓急，有步骤地加以解决。大跃进以来，全局根据现场多变性的特点，在战略布置上采取了建立“三道防线”的办法。这就是把必保的重点工程列为第一线，把可能争取的项目作为第二线，把少用或不用三大材料的工程作为第三线，在材料供应充足时确保一线、大战二线，或者是确保一线、猛攻三线。这就进可以攻，退可以守，在有利和不利形势下都能最大限度地掌握主动权。
    狠抓，就是以抓日计划为中心，贯彻“四抓四不放”。即抓当日生产，不放松次日准备；抓工作量指标，不放松形象进度；抓主体工程，不放松结尾项目；抓重点工程，不放松一般工程。在“四抓四不放”中，又以抓当日生产和次日准备为基本环节。公司和工程处都是一日三抓：早晨抓施工布置和劳动组合，中午抓形象进度和存在问题，晚上抓生产实效和次日安排。工程处抓的更深更细，具体作法是，一抓早上联系三上门（联系材料部门问材料供应，联系加工部门问构件配套，请示解决技术问题）；二抓中午现场三检查（工程进度、质量安全、下步准备）；三抓下午碰头三调度（材料、劳力、机具）。工人队组也有三抓：一抓任务分配和施工准备，二抓劳动组合和工序搭接，三抓竞赛评比。
      （3）在统计方面，实行快速预报制度。
    统计制度是企业管理工作的重要内容之一。随着生产日日红的产生，生产形势发展迅速，各级领导都迫切需要及时掌握和了解生产情况。那种原来把统计认为只能是生产活动结束的实际记录，每天生产情况直到第二天才能提供领导的作法，已经远远不能适应生产日日红的要求。因此，全局通过实践摸索，建立了日进度快速预报统计制度。具体作法是，把日报统计时间提前到当日中午十二时，在这时召开的生产碰头会上，根据上半天实际完成情况和基层生产主管人对下半天生产的切实安排，当场讨论定案，既作为各队组开展评比的根据，又作为当天确保完成的数字进行统计，提前报出进度日报；同时，根据基层的次日安排，预计次日完成数字，称为“明日计划”，成为统计、计划、生产三结合的一个完整制度。这样，在正常情况下，局一级领导均能在当日下班前，既能了解当日完成情况，又能预见明日可能完成的情况，对分析研究生产指导生产提供了具有现实意义的资料。
    经过长期的实践，证明快速预报统计好处很多。主要的好处是：
    第一，可使领导工作不失时机，稳操主动。
    第二，充分发挥了统计促进生产的作用。由于预报数和评比依据数的统一，因而在预报数中就包括有一定主观努力的争取因素，这实际上就起了促进生产的作用。
    第三，有利于改进工作作风和加强基层管理。为使预报数落实和付诸实现，就促进基层管理人员细致摸清情况和走群众路线。
    这种把原来在生产活动结束后的记录，改为在生产进行中提前统计预报的方法，是统计工作上一项高度重视人的主观能动作用和具有深刻的政治意义的重大改革，是统计工作大搞群众运动的结晶。
    （4）在劳动组织方面，改进组合，提高基层生产队组的战斗力。
    生产队（组）是建筑企业最基层的生产组织，是广大职工群众经常活动的场所，企业的生产任务和一切重大工作都要通过队组最后实现，队组工作成绩的好坏，直接决定日日红的命运。第三工程局为增强队组的战斗力，首先注意了队组中政治骨干的配备、局党委决定在混合生产队中建立党支部，在生产小组中建立党小组，并在小组中组成由党、政、工、团小组组长和个别老技工参加的核心小组，领导小组的生产工作。同时实行在生产小组长领导下的几大员的工人管理制度（几大员是计划统计员、劳资员、质量安全员、材料员、成本核算员、宣传员等，视实际需要可多可少），一般尽量使每人都当上一员，实现人人参加管理，加强生产管理的各个环节，充分发挥每个人的作用。这样，基层队组的负责干部普遍感到工作好做了。他们反映说，现在“肩上有责，手中有权，心里亮堂，满身是劲！”
  （二）开展多种经营，大搞节约代用，自力更生地解决建筑材料问题
    为了使建筑材料的供应能够满足跃进形势的需要，三工程局坚持积极平衡的精神，确定了“七分条件，三分争取”的原则。广大职工群众也提出了“没有材料自己找，没有机械自己造”的口号。这种积极主动对国家建设事业负责的精神，一方面推动了大搞新技术、新材料、新结构运动的发展，节约和代用建筑材料，一方面推动了多种经营的发展，出现大搞多种经营的高潮。在1959年全局并将多种经营生产完全纳入计划，使之继续不断地高速度发展。
    在自力更生、土洋并举的方针指导下，全局从1958年下半年开始创办多种经营，经过一年多来的整顿巩固和继续发展，已取得重大成绩。到目前为止，全局已拥有属于原材料生产、机械制造、加工构件和修理的大小骨干工厂五十四个，初步形成了一个为建筑施工服务的多种经营工业网。1959年生产的主要产品达六十多种，产值三千五百余万元，其中像钢材、水泥、木材代用品已部分自给，矿渣棉、油毡纸、耐火砖、电极、电石等全部达到自给自足。
    与此同时，全局大搞以新技术、新材料、新结构为中心内容的设计革新和设计革命，着重抓预应力钢筋混凝土结构，以代替普通钢筋混凝土或钢结构，并且试制和生产使用了石膏矿渣棉水泥、矽酸盐大型屋面板、人造大理石、草木纤维板等十项三十五种新材料。从而少用或不用钢材、水泥、木材等重要建筑材料。此外，坚决彻底地贯彻过去一套材料节约措施。上半年节约了钢材三千余吨，水泥一万三千余吨，木材九千八百余立米。
    目前，三工程局的多种经营尚处在继续发展阶段，生产的材料数量还不是很大。但通过这个时期的实践证明，它的确是解决材料问题的根本方向，是高速度建设社会主义所必须坚持的长远方针。
  （三）大兴甲乙两方互助协作之风，调动各方面的积极因素，保证施工高速度
    共产主义协作是社会主义生产关系的基本特征之一。在甲乙双方协作中，第三工程局特别抓住的一个重要环节，就是主动承担甲方困难，大胆负责，统一调剂和集中使用建筑材料，调动物资潜力，保证高速度施工。在中央规定的分户记账专料专用的正确原则下，把各个甲方的材料集中管理，统一调剂，成套供应，集中使用，以解决材料进场时间和品种规格参差不齐问题，保证施工的高速度，保证完成重点建设任务。据不完全统计，仅上半年即给甲方相互调剂串用钢材两千零三十三吨、水泥两万零八百九十吨、木材两千四百八十多立方米，保证了兰州炼油厂、兰州化工厂等新建工程的提前投入生产。同时，经上级党委批准，第三工程局并在大型工程工地与甲方联合组成工地党委会，下设施工现场指挥部，统一领导施工，统一使用甲乙双方的人力物力，群众把它称为“两股劲拧成一根绳”、“一套人马、一套机构、一本计划，两本账”，这就从组织制度上保证了互助协作的关系。这样作的结果，使施工部门掌握了材料供应的主动权，调动了物资的潜力，进一步发挥了群众的积极性，对解决原材料不足和实现生产日日红起了重要作用。
    第三工程局开展日日红生产运动取得的成果证明，生产日日红，是贯彻党的多快好省地建设社会主义的总路线的必然产物，是生产全面持续跃进新形势下的客观要求和必然产物，是开展群众运动与加强企业管理相结合的结果。这一系列成就，反映了我们在企业管理上的一条根本路线；这条路线的基本内容是：高速度，不断革命，依靠群众。有了这条路线，坚持贯彻这条路线，就可以使企业管理工作愈做愈细，促进企业管理水平不断提高，促进整个企业管理的革命，给充分发挥人的主观能动性和争取更大跃进，开辟了广阔的道路。
