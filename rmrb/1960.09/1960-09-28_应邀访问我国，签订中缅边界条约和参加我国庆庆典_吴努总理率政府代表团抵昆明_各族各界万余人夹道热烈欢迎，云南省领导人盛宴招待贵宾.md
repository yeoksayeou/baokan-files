Xinhua News Agency, Kunming, September 27th: At the invitation of Premier Zhou Enlai, Burmese Federal Prime Minister U Nu and his 42-member Burmese Federal Government delegation arrived in Kunming by special plane from Yangon at noon today for a visit to China. Prime Minister U Nu will sign the Sino-Burmese Border Treaty with Premier Zhou Enlai in Beijing and attend the celebrations of the 11th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China. Prime Minister U Nu's wife and daughter also arrived at the same time.

Li Yimang, China's Ambassador to the Union of Burma, accompanied Prime Minister U Nu and his wife to Kunming today.

Members of the Burmese Federal Government delegation accompanying Prime Minister U Nu on the visit include: Federal Union Executive Committee Member, Kachin State Head, Federal Government Kachin State Affairs Minister Duwa Sinwa Nau, Burmese Federal Minister of Education and Justice Dr. U E Maung, Burmese Federal Attorney General U Yan Aung, Prime Minister's Advisor U Wang, Shan State Government Minister of Education and Health Su Tun Ai, Burmese Federal Member of Parliament, Kachin State Government Minister of Education and Public Works Duwa Zori, Burmese Federal Foreign Ministry Permanent Secretary Ba Lin Dun, Kachin State Affairs Department Secretary to the Parliament Duwa Tan Bang La, Burmese Federal Nationalities House Member Duwa La Kun Du Gong, Federal Union Member of Parliament U Wang Niu, National Unity Front Representative Bo Bo Kun, and others.

When Prime Minister U Nu and his wife, and other distinguished Burmese guests arrived in Kunming today, they were warmly welcomed by Yan Hongyan, First Secretary of the Yunnan Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, Yu Yichuan, Governor of Yunnan Province, Lieutenant General Chen Kang, head of the Chinese People's Liberation Army stationed in Kunming, and other leaders of the province, city, Party, government, army, various democratic parties, people's organizations, and representatives from all sectors.

Governor Yu Yichuan said at the airport: "Just as the people of all ethnic groups in Yunnan Province are joyfully welcoming the 11th anniversary of the founding of our country and the upcoming signing of the Sino-Burmese Border Treaty, we are very honored to have the opportunity to warmly welcome Prime Minister U Nu and his wife here. Prime Minister U Nu is our respected state guest, as well as a close friend and 'Pauk-Phaw' (sibling) of the people of all ethnic groups in Yunnan Province. We have both high respect and special affection for the presence of Prime Minister U Nu and his wife, as well as other distinguished Burmese guests." Yu Yichuan said: "We are pleased to see that, through the joint efforts of Prime Minister U Nu, Premier Zhou Enlai, and other leaders of the two governments, the Sino-Burmese friendly relations based on the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence have been further developed, and our kinship-like friendship will be further consolidated and developed."

Prime Minister U Nu then said: "We are very pleased and grateful that upon our arrival this time, the governor, citizens, and army of Kunming City have welcomed us as warmly as if we were relatives and 'Pauk-Phaw'. I visited Kunming three years ago, and everything I saw, heard, and did at that time is still deeply engraved in my mind, as if it happened yesterday. Since then, friends from Kunming have come to Burma at my invitation, and the leaders of our country, Burma, have also come to Kunming time and time again. Such mutual friendly visits between countries and between regions are precisely because we have the Five Principles. Therefore, we should strictly adhere to the Five Principles initiated by Premier Zhou Enlai." Prime Minister U Nu said that in observing the international situation at present, one will find that one country is hostile to another, and one country is suspicious of another. All of this should be stopped in time. As for China and Burma, thanks to the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, we do not engage in provocation or preparation for sabotage against each other, but only in close and friendly cooperation. This shows how beneficial the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence are. "My visit to Beijing this time is not for anything else, but to sign the Sino-Burmese Border Treaty. Signing this treaty is not an easy task. If it were not for the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence I just mentioned, it would not be possible to sign such a treaty at this time." Therefore, I wish Premier Zhou Enlai, who initiated the Five Principles, a happy spirit and good health, and I wish all friends led by the Governor of Yunnan Province a happy spirit and good health.

The speeches of Prime Minister U Nu and Governor Yu Yichuan were warmly applauded by the welcoming crowd.

Today, Kunming Airport, decorated solemnly and beautifully, flew the national flags of China and Burma and dozens of colorful flags, and huge banners written in both Chinese and Burmese languages ​​were hung on the buildings: "Welcome Burmese Federal Prime Minister U Nu and the Burmese Government Delegation." Thousands of people of all ethnic groups, dressed in festive costumes, waited for the arrival of the distinguished Burmese guests.

At 1:00 PM, the plane carrying the distinguished guests slowly landed. At this time, the whole airport was jubilant, and the band played welcoming music. The applause, cheers, gongs, drums, and suonas of the welcoming crowd intertwined. People waved flowers and the national flags of China and Burma, and constantly shouted: "Welcome Prime Minister U Nu!" "Welcome the distinguished Burmese guests!" "Long live Sino-Burmese friendship!"

Prime Minister U Nu stepped out of the cabin with a smile and waved frequently to the welcoming crowd. Yan Hongyan, First Secretary of the Yunnan Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, Governor Yu Yichuan, Lieutenant General Chen Kang, head of the PLA stationed in Kunming, and others walked to the plane and shook hands cordially with Prime Minister U Nu and other distinguished guests. The band played the national anthems of Burma and China. Prime Minister U Nu, accompanied by Yan Hongyan, First Secretary of the Yunnan Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, and Governor Yu Yichuan, reviewed the guard of honor. A group of young people ran up and presented flowers to Prime Minister U Nu and other distinguished Burmese guests. Then, Governor Yu Yichuan and Prime Minister U Nu gave speeches successively.

After their speeches, Prime Minister U Nu and other distinguished Burmese guests walked to the welcoming line to meet the welcoming crowd. At this time, the cheers and slogans of the crowd rose one after another, and young people in festive costumes ran out of the crowd again and again to present flowers to Prime Minister U Nu and his wife. Prime Minister U Nu smiled and waved constantly to the welcoming crowd.

Then, Prime Minister U Nu and his wife and other distinguished Burmese guests, accompanied by Yan Hongyan, First Secretary of the Yunnan Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, Governor Yu Yichuan, and others, drove from the airport to the hotel. They were warmly welcomed by more than 10,000 people from all ethnic groups and sectors of Kunming City along the way.

Yu Peiwen, Director of the Protocol Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, who had rushed to Kunming from Beijing to welcome Prime Minister U Nu, also went to the airport today to welcome him.

Also present at the airport today to welcome Prime Minister U Nu were: Zhang Chong, Wu Zuomin, and Liu Zhuofu, Vice Governors of Yunnan Province, Zhao Zengyi, First Secretary of the Kunming Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, Pan Shuoduan, Mayor of Kunming City, Lieutenant General Chen Kang and Major General Lu Ruilin, heads of the Chinese People's Liberation Army stationed in Kunming, Liu Linyuan, Cun Shusheng, and Wang Shaoyan, Vice Chairmen of the Yunnan Provincial Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, heads of local organizations of various democratic parties and people's organizations, and heads of various agencies and departments, as well as Gong Shou (Dai nationality), Si La Shan (Jingpo nationality), Si Hongsheng (Dai nationality), and Pai Qiren (Jingpo nationality), Deputy Governors of the Dehong Dai and Jingpo Autonomous Prefecture.

Xinhua News Agency, Kunming, September 27th: Yan Hongyan, First Secretary of the Yunnan Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, and Yu Yichuan, Governor of Yunnan Province, held a grand banquet tonight to warmly welcome Prime Minister U Nu and all members of the Burmese Government delegation led by him.

Prime Minister U Nu spoke at the banquet. He said: "This time, I brought 300 people, but there are still many people who hope to visit China. If everyone who wants to come were allowed to come, there might be 300,000. There are two reasons why they want to visit China: The first reason is that visiting China is like visiting relatives, and it feels like returning to their hometown. The other reason is that the major issue of the Sino-Burmese border is about to be resolved. Our delegation includes people from many fields, including government leaders, as well as people from the political, military, cultural, and sports circles. We brought people from all walks of life because in addition to friendly exchanges between the leaders of the two countries, we also need friendship between the armies, between people in the cultural circles, between workers, and between farmers, from top to bottom, in order to achieve the goals we want to achieve." Prime Minister U Nu then said that the Sino-Burmese Border Treaty that we will sign in Beijing would have been difficult to achieve even with the efforts of Premier Zhou Enlai and myself if China and Burma were not living together in friendship. Now that all preparations for signing the Sino-Burmese Border Treaty have been completed, this shows that the friendly relations between our two countries are solid. However, it is not enough to just build a friendly building; like ordinary buildings, it needs to be repaired regularly. In order to prevent our Sino-Burmese friendship building from collapsing, I suggest that the leaders of our two countries take good care of this friendly building." Prime Minister U Nu finally said that, as the governor just said, Yunnan Province has an important responsibility in further promoting and consolidating Sino-Burmese friendship. Therefore, I wish the people of Yunnan Province, who are standing at the forefront of Sino-Burmese friendship, will complete this task even more successfully in the future.

Before Prime Minister U Nu's speech, Governor Yu Yichuan, on behalf of the people of all ethnic groups in the province, expressed a warm welcome and high respect to the distinguished guests. He said that the traditional friendship between the people of China and Burma has been further developed under the guidance of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence jointly advocated by Premier Zhou Enlai and Prime Minister U Nu. The flowers of Sino-Burmese friendship are in full bloom. The complex border issues left over by history have been resolved satisfactorily in just a few months due to the joint efforts of the leaders and people of the two countries, which fully demonstrates the great spirit of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. This is not only warmly welcomed by the people of our two countries, but also widely praised by peace-loving people all over the world. The people of all ethnic groups in Yunnan Province are particularly pleased with this. Governor Yu Yichuan said: "With the smooth resolution of the Sino-Burmese border issue, the traditional friendly relations in the border areas of our two countries will be further consolidated and developed. The rice and salt that Your Excellency Prime Minister sent to the people in the border areas of our province embodies the deep friendship of the Burmese people to the people in the border areas of our province. I would like to take this opportunity to express my gratitude."

Governor Yu Yichuan finally said: "Your Excellency Prime Minister and other distinguished guests are about to go to our capital to celebrate our National Day with the people of our country and sign the Sino-Burmese Border Treaty. This is a significant event, and we sincerely express our best wishes."

During the banquet, the hosts and guests frequently raised their glasses to toast to Sino-Burmese friendship, to the Sino-Burmese border becoming a border of peace and friendship, to the victory of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, to the increasingly consolidated and developed friendship between China and Burma, and to the friendship between the people of the two border areas for generations to come.

Li Yimang, China's Ambassador to Burma, also attended the banquet tonight.

Prime Minister U Nu

Burmese Federal Prime Minister U Nu was born on May 25, 1907, in Wakema, Myaungmya District. He studied at Yangon National Myoma High School and Yangon University (Bachelor of Arts and Bachelor of Laws). Before the war, Prime Minister U Nu was the chairman of the Yangon University Student Union while studying law. He joined the "We Burmese Party" (ie, the Dobama Asiayone), which played a leading role in the independence movement. In 1936, he led a student strike, which promoted reforms in Burma. He founded the Red Dragon Bookstore to help publicize the doctrines of democracy and freedom.

During the war, Prime Minister U Nu was arrested and sentenced to two years in prison for his political activities demanding post-war autonomy as a condition for cooperation with the British. After the Japanese occupation, he was released in Mandalay and reorganized the We Burmese Party. General Aung San, U Nu and their colleagues established the Burmese Army and the guerrilla organization for national resistance.

After the war, various ethnic and national groups, political organizations, and other people in Burma jointly organized the Anti-Fascist People's Freedom League. U Nu became the first vice-chairman of the Anti-Fascist People's Freedom League under the leadership of General Aung San.

When General Aung San became the vice-chairman of the (British) Governor's Executive Council in 1947, U Nu was elected as the chairman of the Constitutional Assembly that formulated the Burmese Constitution.

After General Aung San was assassinated on July 19, 1947, U Nu took over the leadership of the country, signed the Nu-Attlee Agreement, which stipulated the final conditions for freedom, and became Prime Minister when independence was declared in January 1948.

He resigned from the post of Prime Minister in June 1956, and was re-elected in March 1957. After the split of the Anti-Fascist People's Freedom League, he led the "Clean Faction". In October 1958, his government handed over power to the caretaker cabinet led by General Ne Win. On April 4, 1960, he was re-elected as Prime Minister through general election. He is the chairman of the Anti-Fascist People's Freedom League Clean Faction, now named the Union of Burma Alliance.

As one of the leaders of the Colombo Conference countries, Prime Minister U Nu contributed to the convening of the Bandung Asian-African Conference in May 1955 and the promotion of economic cooperation among Southeast Asian countries. He has led friendly delegations to visit many countries.

In June 1954, when Chinese Premier Zhou Enlai visited Burma, Prime Minister U Nu and Premier Zhou Enlai issued a joint statement, jointly advocating the famous Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence as the guideline for Sino-Burmese relations. Prime Minister U Nu visited China three times in 1954, 1956, and 1957.

Prime Minister U Nu is a devout Buddhist and a well-known theologian. Prime Minister U Nu is also a writer and playwright.

    应邀访问我国，签订中缅边界条约和参加我国庆庆典
　　吴努总理率政府代表团抵昆明
　　各族各界万余人夹道热烈欢迎，云南省领导人盛宴招待贵宾
    新华社昆明27日电　缅甸联邦总理吴努和他率领的缅甸联邦政府代表团一行四十二人，应周恩来总理的邀请来我国访问，今天中午乘专机从仰光到达昆明，吴努总理将在北京同周恩来总理签订中缅边界条约和参加中华人民共和国成立十一周年的庆祝典礼。吴努总理的夫人和女儿也同时到达。
    我国驻缅甸联邦大使李一氓今天陪同吴努总理和夫人来到昆明。
    随同吴努总理前来访问的缅甸联邦政府代表团团员有：联邦同盟执委、克钦邦邦长、联邦政府克钦邦事务部部长杜瓦信瓦瑙，缅甸联邦教育和司法部部长吴埃貌博士，缅甸联邦检察总长吴延昂，总理顾问吴旺，掸邦政府教育和卫生部部长苏吞埃，缅甸联邦国会议员、克钦邦政府教育和公共工程部部长杜瓦佐里，缅甸联邦外交部常任秘书巴林顿，克钦邦事务部驻国会秘书杜瓦坦邦拉，缅甸联邦民族院议员杜瓦拉昆杜贡，联邦同盟国会议员吴旺纽，民族团结阵线代表波波昆等。
    吴努总理和夫人及其他缅甸贵宾们今天到达昆明的时候，受到了中共云南省委第一书记阎红彦，云南省省长于一川，中国人民解放军驻昆明部队首长陈康中将等省、市党、政府、军队和各民主党派、各人民团体负责人以及各界群众的热烈欢迎。
    于一川省长在机场上讲话说：正当云南省各族人民以欢欣鼓舞的心情迎接我国建国十一周年和中缅边界条约即将签订的前夕，我们能有机会在这里热烈欢迎吴努总理和夫人，我们感到十分荣幸。吴努总理是我们尊敬的国宾，又是云南省各族人民亲密的朋友和“胞波”。对吴努总理和夫人以及其他缅甸贵宾的光临，我们既怀着崇高的敬意，又感到格外亲切。于一川说：我们高兴地看到，经过吴努总理、周恩来总理和两国政府其他领导人的共同努力，建立在和平共处五项原则基础上的中缅友好关系已经有了新的发展，我们之间亲戚般的友谊将更加巩固和发展。
    吴努总理接着讲话说：我们这次到来，省长及昆明市市民、军队像欢迎亲人和“胞波”一样热烈地欢迎我们，我们感到非常高兴和感谢。三年前我到过昆明，那时的所见所闻和所做的一切事情，到今天还深刻留在我的脑际，宛如昨天所发生的一样。在这以后，昆明的朋友们应我的邀请到了缅甸，我们国家缅甸的领导人也一次又一次地来到昆明。这样，一国与一国、一地与一地的互相友好访问，正是由于我们有了五项原则。因此，我们应该严格奉行周恩来总理创议的五项原则。吴努总理说，目前在观察国际局势中，会发现一国敌视一国，一国疑惧一国，这一切应该及时制止。至于中缅两国，由于在和平共处的五项原则下，彼此不进行挑衅和准备破坏活动，只有亲密友好的合作。由此可见，和平共处五项原则具有多么大的好处。我这次到北京，不是为了别的，正是去签订中缅边界条约，签订这个条约不是轻而易举的事，如果没有我刚才所说的和平共处五项原则，在此时是不能签订这种条约的。因此，我祝首创五项原则的周恩来总理精神愉快，身体健康，祝云南省省长为首的全体朋友们精神愉快，身体健康。
    吴努总理和于一川省长的讲话，受到全场欢迎群众的热烈鼓掌欢迎。
    今天，打扮得庄严美丽的昆明机场上，飘扬着中缅两国的国旗和数十面彩旗，建筑物上悬挂着用中缅两国文字写的巨幅标语：“欢迎缅甸联邦总理吴努和缅甸政府代表团”。数千名各族人民穿着盛装，等候着缅甸贵宾的到来。
    午后一时，贵宾们乘坐的飞机徐徐着陆。这时，全场欢腾，乐队奏起迎宾曲。欢迎群众的掌声、欢呼声、锣鼓声和唢呐声交织在一起。人们挥舞着鲜花和中缅两国国旗，不断高呼：“欢迎吴努总理！”“欢迎缅甸贵宾们！”“中缅友好万岁！”
    吴努总理微笑着步出机舱，向欢迎的人群频频挥手致意。中共云南省委第一书记阎红彦、省长于一川、驻昆明部队首长陈康中将等走到机前，和吴努总理及其他贵宾们亲切握手。乐队奏起缅中两国国歌。吴努总理由中共云南省委第一书记阎红彦和于一川省长陪同检阅了仪仗队。一群青年跑上前来，把鲜花献给吴努总理和其他缅甸贵宾。接着，于一川省长和吴努总理先后讲了话。
    在他们讲话以后，吴努总理和其他缅甸贵宾们走向欢迎的行列，和欢迎的群众见面。这时，群众的欢呼声、口号声此起彼伏，穿着盛装的青年们一次又一次地从队伍中跑出来向吴努总理和夫人献花。吴努总理微笑着不断挥手向欢迎的群众致意。
    接着，吴努总理和夫人等缅甸贵宾由中共云南省委第一书记阎红彦、省长于一川等人陪同，乘汽车从机场驶往宾馆。他们在路上受到昆明市各族各界万余人的夹道热烈欢迎。

    新华社昆明27日电　中共云南省委第一书记阎红彦、云南省省长于一川今晚举行盛大宴会，热烈欢迎吴努总理和他率领的缅甸政府代表团全体成员。
    吴努总理在宴会上讲了话。他说：这一次，我带来了三百人，但是还有很多人希望来中国访问。如果允许所有愿来的人都来的话，那也许会有三十万。他们之所以希望来中国访问，有两个原因：第一个原因是到中国来访问，就像走亲戚一样，也好像回到了自己的家乡，另一个原因是将要解决中缅边界这个重大问题。我们的代表团中，包括了很多方面的人士，有政府的领导人员，也有政治、军事、文化和体育界人士。我们之所以带来了各阶层的人士，因为除了两国领导人的友好往来以外，还需要军队之间、文化界人士之间、工人之间、农民之间，从上到下都友好，才能达到我们要达到的目的。吴努总理接着说，我们将在北京签订的中缅边界条约，如果中缅两国不是友好相处，那么尽管周恩来总理和我怎样努力，也是难以做到的。现在，签订中缅边界条约的各项准备工作已经完成，这说明了我们两国的友好关系是巩固的。但是，友好大厦光是建立起来还是不够的，正像普通的建筑物一样，还需要经常加以培修。为了我们中缅两国的友好大厦不致坍塌，我建议我们两国的领导人很好地保护这座友好大厦。吴努总理最后说，正如省长刚才所说，在进一步促进和巩固中缅友谊当中，云南省担负着重要的责任。因此，我祝福站在中缅友好最前面的云南省人民今后会更加出色地完成这项任务。
    在吴努总理讲话之前，于一川省长代表全省各族人民向贵宾们表示热烈的欢迎和崇高的敬意。他说，中缅两国人民的传统友谊，在周恩来总理和吴努总理共同倡导的和平共处五项原则指导下有了进一步的发展。中缅友谊的花朵正在盛开。历史上遗留下来的复杂的边界问题，由于两国领导人和人民的共同努力，在短短几个月的时间内就得到圆满的解决，这充分显示了和平共处五项原则的伟大精神。这不仅为我们两国人民所热烈欢迎，而且获得了全世界爱好和平人民的普遍赞扬。对此，云南省各族人民尤其感到高兴。于一川省长说：随着中缅边界问题的顺利解决，我们两国边境地区的传统友好关系将更加巩固和发展。总理阁下送给我省边疆地区人民的大米和食盐，体现了缅甸人民对我省边境人民的深厚情谊，我愿借此机会表示感谢。
    于一川省长最后说：总理阁下和其他贵宾们即将前往我国首都，同我国人民一起欢度我国国庆节，并将签订中缅边界条约，这是一件具有重大意义的事件，我们衷心地表示最良好的祝愿。
    席间，宾主频频举杯，祝中缅友好，祝中缅边界成为和平友好的边界而干杯，为和平共处五项原则的胜利，为中缅两国友谊日益巩固和发展，为两国边界人民世世代代的友好，干杯。
    我国驻缅甸大使李一氓也出席了今晚的宴会。

    新华社昆明27日电　缅甸联邦总理吴努等贵宾，今天下午游览了昆明市圆通山公园等名胜风景区。
    下午五时半，吴努总理等贵宾在于一川省长等人的陪同下，乘车来到了圆通山公园。吴努总理下车后漫步前行，观看四周景色，他称赞说，昆明四周都有山水，是个美丽的城市。吴努总理这次是重游圆通山公园，他游览了樱花林和动物园，直到天晚才归。
    云南省副省长张冲、昆明市市长潘朔端，今天下午陪同缅甸联邦检察总长吴延昂，联邦同盟执委、克钦邦邦长、联邦政府克钦邦事务部部长杜瓦信瓦瑙等贵宾，乘车至昆明西山游览了西山名胜古迹。
    新华社仰光27日电　缅甸联邦总理吴努和他所率领的政府代表团应中华人民共和国政府和国务院总理周恩来的邀请，今天上午乘专机离开这里前往中国进行友好访问。
