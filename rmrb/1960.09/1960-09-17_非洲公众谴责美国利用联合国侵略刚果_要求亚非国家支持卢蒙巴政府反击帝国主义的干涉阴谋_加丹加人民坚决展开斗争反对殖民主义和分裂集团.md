Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, September 15th: African figures in Cairo successively condemned on the evening of the 15th the plot of imperialism, headed by the United States, to undermine the independence and unity of the Congo under the banner of the United Nations.

Okelo, the head of the Kenyan office in Cairo, said that what happened in the Congo was a struggle between the African liberation movement and the world's imperialist aggressors. He said that Africans have seen through and exposed the imperialist plot against the legitimate government led by Prime Minister Lumumba. Okelo called on peace-loving countries to support the Lumumba government.

Rutra, the head of the Rwanda-Urundi office in Cairo, condemned the attitude of the "UN forces" in the Congo, saying that their actions have made the people of Rwanda-Urundi lose confidence in the United Nations.

Kamanga, the head of the Rhodesian office in Cairo, condemned the "UN forces" in the Congo for siding with Western imperialist countries to help them realize their imperialist plots. He also called on Asian and African countries and other peace-loving countries to take firm and resolute attitudes immediately toward the endless plots of Western imperialism in the Congo.

Mark, the head of the South African office in Cairo, also condemned the attitude of the "UN forces." He demanded that those countries that sent troops to participate in the "UN forces" withdraw their troops. He angrily condemned the United States, believing that it was responsible for continuously providing military assistance to the Belgian imperialist troops and the Tshombe reactionary troops.

Prior to this, Fadl Jalal, Chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee of the Arab United National Union, also condemned the United Nations' actions against the Congolese people at a press conference held here on the 14th, saying: "The UAR will never participate in any action against the unity and independence of the Congo."

After Jalal condemned UN Secretary-General Hammarskjöld's activities against the Congolese people, he said that the Congo issue has become an issue for the entire Africa. This is not only related to the Congolese people and the African people, but also related to all countries near and far.

Jalal finally said that he represents the Arab United National Union in supporting the legitimate government of the Congo.

Xinhua News Agency, London, September 15th: African figures here strongly condemned the "UN forces'" aggressive activities in the Congo.

Dennis Pombeh, Secretary-General of the African Organization Committee, pointed out that African countries cannot allow the "UN forces" to maintain the interests of colonial and imperialist countries, headed by the United States, in African countries. He demanded the withdrawal of all African troops currently under the command of the United Nations in the Congo.

Enoch Dumbutshena, representative of the Southern Rhodesia National Democratic Party in London, said that the "UN forces" are merely being used to protect the interests of Western monopolists and subvert the legitimate government of the Congo. He believes that full support should be given to the legitimate government headed by Lumumba, which is fighting to defend the independence and territorial integrity of the Republic of the Congo.

Xinhua News Agency, September 16th: Elisabethville dispatch: The patriotic struggle launched by the people of Katanga Province in the Congo against the colonialists and the Tshombe splittist group continues to develop.

According to reports, on the 15th, in Luena, an important stronghold on the railway line from Elisabethville, the capital of Katanga Province, to the Kamina military base, local people surrounded 800 colonialists there. In Bukama, north of Luena, 400 Baluba people armed with bows and arrows, spears, and bicycle chains attacked the local puppet authorities on the 15th. They angrily killed three Tshombe reactionary policemen and also killed a local reactionary chieftain. The Tshombe reactionary police suppressed the uprising, killing and wounding some demonstrators.

The news said that the Baluba people who attacked Manono two days ago had controlled the entire city of Manono on the 15th. The "UN forces'" Irish troops there are stepping up their interference in the people's patriotic struggle.

At the same time, the Congolese government forces that entered the Kongolo area of Katanga Province have advanced to within thirty-six miles of the interior of Katanga Province.

According to the Associated Press, the "UN forces" in Katanga Province have received instructions to order the Congolese troops to be "driven out" of Katanga Province.
