Xinhua News Agency, Rabat, September 26th: Guinean President Sékou Touré and his entourage left Rabat this morning for home after a brief visit to Morocco.

At the Rabat airport, Sékou Touré, speaking to reporters, reiterated Guinea's firm support for the struggle of the Congolese people. He emphasized that the current struggle in the Congo has a significant impact on the entire African liberation movement. If the struggle of the Congolese people fails, it will affect the struggle in Africa, especially the struggle of the Algerian people.

He said: Guinea supports Lumumba not only because he is our friend, but also because he was elected by the Congolese Parliament, the supreme organ of power. He emphasized that the only legitimate government in the Congo is the government elected by the parliament. Guinea's position on the Congo is unequivocal, and it condemns all conspiracies by colonialists and imperialists in the Congo.

Touré said: Guinea condemns all activities carried out under the guise of the United Nations to create contradictions in the Congo to benefit the colonialists. He continued: For us, there is no question of making a false either/or choice between the Congo and the United Nations. For us, we want to create conditions for the welfare of the Congolese people, we want to respect the freedom of the Congolese people, and we want to cooperate loyally with the Congolese people on the basis of equality and friendship. Our only choice is to affirm the Congo's exercise of its inalienable right to independence.

Speaking about the United Nations' intervention in the Congo, he also said that he believes: the United Nations should be an organization that respects all countries regardless of nationality, religion, or skin color, guarantees the normal survival of small countries, and establishes and strengthens cooperation between all countries within the scope of true peace. He continued: Therefore, the United Nations should respect the dignity, sovereignty, and independence of the Congo, should not act outside the scope of the instructions of the Congolese government, and should not represent the interests of some against others. He said: What Nkrumah said at the United Nations expressed the views that he (Touré) wanted to state at the United Nations.

Finally, he spoke about the Algerian issue and reiterated that Guinea will always stand with the Algerian people.

President Touré arrived in Rabat on the afternoon of the 25th from Cairo after visiting the Soviet Union, China, the Mongolian People's Republic, the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, Indonesia, and India.

Moroccan Minister of Justice, Acting Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs Abdallah Halik Torres, other responsible officials, and foreign diplomatic envoys went to the airport to welcome and see off President Touré and his entourage. The Moroccan King and Crown Prince are currently abroad. Bai Ren, the Chinese Ambassador to Morocco, also went to the airport to welcome and see off President Touré.

　　杜尔总统在摩洛哥发表谈话
　　几内亚坚决支持刚果人民的斗争
　　谴责在联合国掩护下的一切殖民主义活动
　　在摩洛哥作短暂访问后
　　杜尔总统离拉巴特回国
    新华社拉巴特26日电　几内亚共和国总统塞古·杜尔和他的随行人员在摩洛哥作短暂访问之后，今天上午离开拉巴特回国。
    塞古·杜尔在拉巴特机场上向新闻记者发表谈话时重申，几内亚坚决支持刚果人民的斗争。他强调说，刚果今天的斗争对于整个非洲大陆的解放运动有重大影响。如果刚果人民的斗争失败了，结果将会影响在非洲的斗争，特别是阿尔及利亚人民的斗争。
    他说：几内亚支持卢蒙巴，这不是仅仅由于他是我们的朋友，而且是因为他是作为最高权力机关的刚果议会所选举出来的。他强调指出：在刚果，唯一的合法政府，是议会所选举的政府。几内亚对刚果所采取的立场是毫不含糊的，这个立场谴责殖民主义者和帝国主义者在刚果的一切阴谋。
    杜尔说：几内亚谴责在联合国掩护之下，为了在刚果制造矛盾以利于殖民主义者的行动而进行的一切活动。他接着说：对我们来说，谈不到要在刚果和联合国之间作出虚假的进退两难的选择。对我们来说，我们要为刚果人民的福利创造条件，我们要尊重刚果人民的自由，并在平等和友好的基础上忠诚地同刚果人民合作。我们的唯一选择，就是要确认刚果行使自己的不可剥夺的独立权利。
    他谈到联合国在刚果进行的干涉时还说，他认为：联合国应该是这样一个组织：不分民族、宗教和肤色尊重所有的国家，保证小国的正常生存，并在真正和平的范围之内树立和巩固一切国家之间的合作。他接着说：因此，联合国应该尊重刚果的尊严、主权和独立，不应该在刚果政府的指示的范围之外行动，不应该代表某些人的利益来反对另外一些人。他说：恩克鲁玛在联合国所说的话，表达了他本人（杜尔）要在联合国申述的主张。
    他最后谈到阿尔及利亚问题时重申几内亚永远站在阿尔及利亚人民一边。
    杜尔总统是在访问了苏联、中国、蒙古人民共和国、越南民主共和国、印度尼西亚和印度之后，25日下午从开罗来到拉巴特的。
    前往机场迎送杜尔总统及其随行人员的有摩洛哥司法大臣、代理副首相兼外交大臣阿卜杜拉·哈利克·托里斯等负责官员和各国外交使节。摩洛哥国王和王储现在国外。中国驻摩洛哥大使白认也曾前往机场迎接和欢送杜尔总统。
