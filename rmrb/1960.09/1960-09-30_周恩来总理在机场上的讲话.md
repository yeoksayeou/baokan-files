Xinhua News Agency, September 29th. Premier Zhou Enlai's speech at the airport welcoming Prime Minister Abbas:

Respected Prime Minister Abbas Ferhat of the Provisional Government of the Republic of Algeria, esteemed distinguished guests of the delegation of the Provisional Government of the Republic of Algeria, friends, comrades:

Today, we are very pleased to be able to welcome in our capital, Beijing, the representatives of the heroic Algerian people, friends of the Chinese people, Prime Minister Abbas Ferhat of the Provisional Government of the Republic of Algeria. On behalf of the Chinese government and people, I extend the warmest welcome to Prime Minister Abbas and all the distinguished guests.

In recent years, under the leadership of Prime Minister Abbas, the heroic Algerian people and the Algerian National Liberation Army have waged a courageous and unyielding just struggle against colonialism for national independence, and have achieved a series of major victories, effectively打击(dǎ jī, means "struck" or "attacked") the armed suppression and aggression policies of the French colonialists supported by U.S. imperialism. This heroic and unyielding revolutionary spirit of the Algerian people has set a brilliant example for the African people and has won the deep sympathy and resolute support of the Asian people and the people of the world. The Chinese people have always expressed their heartfelt admiration for the heroic struggle of the Algerian people and believe that your victory is our victory, and also a great victory for the people of the world against imperialism and colonialism. The Chinese government and the Chinese people have consistently and unswervingly deeply sympathized with and fully supported your just struggle until you achieve the final and complete victory.

The close friendship between the Chinese and Algerian peoples is developing and consolidating in the common struggle against imperialism and colonialism. On the eve of our National Day, Prime Minister Abbas Ferhat personally led a delegation of the Provisional Government of the Republic of Algeria to visit our country, bringing us the deep fighting friendship of the Algerian people, which is a great encouragement and support to the Chinese people. I am deeply convinced that the Prime Minister's visit will make new contributions to further consolidating and developing the friendship between China and Algeria. Please allow me to wish the Prime Minister and all the distinguished guests of the delegation a successful visit to our Country.

Long live the victory of the national liberation struggle of the Algerian people!

Long live the friendship of the Chinese and Algerian people!

Long live world peace!
