Xinhua News Agency, 3rd. This summer, over 135,000 students graduated from universities and colleges across the country. Filled with the enthusiasm to dedicate themselves to the construction of the motherland, they are successively taking up their work posts.

This year's college graduates were cultivated under the Party's policy of education serving proletarian politics and combining education with productive labor in the field of higher education. In recent years, they have actively studied Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong's works, experienced many political movements and labor training, received profound class education, strengthened their labor perspective and mass perspective, and further improved their ideological awareness. Many people have honorably joined the Communist Party and the Communist Youth League. Among the graduates of Tsinghua University this year, 89% are Party members and League members. The Road and Bridge Construction major of the Civil Engineering Department of Hunan University had only one Communist Party member and sixteen Communist Youth League members when they first enrolled. Now it has developed into eleven Communist Party members and thirty-four Communist Youth League members.

While improving their political awareness, the graduates have also learned rich basic theories and professional knowledge. Because universities and colleges resolutely implement the Party's education policy and closely integrate theoretical learning with practice, the graduates' scientific and technological level and independent working ability have been significantly improved. The vast majority of this year's graduates from the Department of Mechanical Engineering of Tsinghua University chose projects of great value in the country's economic construction as their graduation design topics, and many design schemes reached advanced scientific and technological levels. The academic performance of nearly 10,000 graduates from sixteen universities and colleges in Shanghai was rated as excellent and good by the vast majority. Their papers are full of creative spirit. Graduates from the worker-peasant class of the Electromechanical Department of Beijing Mining College completed 30 important technical innovation projects during their production internships. Pharmacy graduates from Sichuan Medical College, who interned in Chongqing and Chengdu, humbly learned from workers, combined with production practice, and put forward more than 180 technical innovation suggestions, summarizing more than 100 empirical materials.

Under the Party's kind guidance, the graduates who are striving forward along the road of being both red and expert, on the eve of leaving school, expressed their determination to resolutely listen to the Party and regard the needs of the motherland as their own aspirations. Representatives of more than 3,300 graduates from seven universities and colleges in Changsha City stated at the city's send-off meeting: We will resolutely respond to the Party's call, happily take up our work posts, and make contributions to the cause of socialism and communism in the technological revolution and cultural revolution. The 269 graduates from the Agronomy Department and Agricultural Specialized Course of Subei Agricultural College wrote in a letter to the Party and League organizations: "We were cultivated by the Party, and the Party and the people gave us knowledge and strength. We guarantee that we will not consider conditions when working. We have the confidence to build our motherland more beautiful and prosperous with our own hands." This year, the number of college graduates nationwide has increased by more than 92% compared with last year. Among them, there are about 17,000 graduates from schools run by special districts and counties. Such a substantial increase in the number of college graduates is a victory for the Party's mass education campaign and the result of the great leap forward in education. However, due to the vigorous development of socialist construction, the number of graduates this year still falls far short of the country's needs. Therefore, the allocation principle for this year's graduates focuses on ensuring key areas and compressing general areas. The allocation method has also been changed. Except for a small part that is uniformly allocated by the central government, the vast majority is now allocated independently by the departments in charge of universities and colleges and by provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions.

    祖国的需要就是自己的志愿
    十三万高等学校毕业生陆续走上工作岗位
    新华社3日讯　今年暑期，全国有十三万五千多名学生从高等学校毕业。他们怀着献身祖国建设事业的热情，正陆续走上工作岗位。
    今年高等学校毕业生，是党在高等教育领域里实行教育为无产阶级的政治服务、教育与生产劳动相结合的方针下培养出来的。几年来，他们积极学习马克思列宁主义和毛泽东著作，经历了许多政治运动和劳动锻炼，受到深刻的阶级教育，劳动观点、群众观点加强了，思想觉悟进一步提高，不少人光荣地加入了共产党和共青团。清华大学本届毕业生中，89％是党员和团员。湖南大学土木系道路建筑专业六十个毕业生，刚入学时只有一个共产党员、十六个共青团员，现在已发展到十一个共产党员、三十四个共青团员。
    毕业生们在政治觉悟提高的同时，也学到了丰富的基础理论和专业知识。由于各高等学校坚决执行党的教育方针，理论学习密切联系实际，因而毕业生的科学技术水平和独立工作能力都有显著提高。清华大学机械系应届毕业生绝大多数都是选择国家经济建设中具有重大价值的项目作为毕业设计题目，不少设计方案达到了先进的科学技术水平。上海十六所高等院校近万名毕业生，绝大多数学业成绩被评为优秀和良好。他们写的论文富有创造精神。北京矿业学院机电系工农班的毕业生，在生产实习中就完成了三十项重要的技术革新项目。四川医学院在重庆、成都实习的药学系毕业生，向工人虚心学习，结合生产实际，提出了一百八十多项技术革新建议，总结了一百多篇经验性资料。
    在党的亲切教导下，沿着又红又专道路奋勇前进的毕业生们，在离校前夕，纷纷表示坚决听党的话，把祖国的需要作为自己的志愿。长沙市七所高等院校的三千三百多名应届毕业生的代表，在全市欢送会上表示：坚决响应党的召唤，愉快地走上工作岗位，在技术革命和文化革命中，为社会主义和共产主义事业建立功勋。苏北农学院农学系和农业专修科的二百六十九位毕业生，在给党、团组织的信中写着：“我们是党培养成人的，是党和人民给予我们知识和力量，我们保证做到工作不计条件。我们有信心用自己的双手把祖国建设得更美丽、更富强。”今年全国高等学校毕业生人数比去年增加了92％强。其中专区和县办的学校的毕业生就有一万七千人左右。高等学校毕业生人数如此大幅度的增长，是党的全党全民大办教育的胜利，也是教育事业大跃进的结果。但是由于社会主义建设事业的蓬勃发展，今年毕业生人数仍然远远不能满足国家的需要。因此，今年毕业生的分配原则注意了保证重点，压缩一般。分配方法也有所改变，除一小部分由中央统一分配外，其余绝大部分改由主管高等学校的各部门和省、市、自治区自行分配。
