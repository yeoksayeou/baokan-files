Xinhua News Agency, New York, 17th: The United Nations Security Council concluded its meeting this morning discussing the situation in the Congo. The US representative coerced a majority of the Security Council members by illegal means to pass a resolution requesting the United Nations to hold an emergency General Assembly to discuss the Congo situation. The purpose of this action by the United States is to attempt to use the voting machine to force the General Assembly to support the US aggression in the Congo.

At yesterday's continued Security Council meeting, the US representative brazenly used the voting machine to reject the Soviet Union's proposal of the 15th on the Congo situation. The Soviet proposal demanded an immediate cessation of all forms of interference in the Republic of the Congo, and the abolition of the US-controlled "UN Forces" headquarters in the Congo. The result of the vote on the Soviet proposal was: two votes in favor (Soviet Union, Poland), seven votes against (US, UK, France, Italy, Argentina, Ecuador and Chiang Kai-shek's elements), and two abstentions (Ceylon, Tunisia).

Subsequently, the United States actively supported a joint proposal put forward by Tunisia and other countries. This proposal was essentially the same as the US proposal put forward on the 15th, requesting the Security Council to authorize UN Secretary-General Hammarskjöld to "continue to make efforts to implement" the Security Council resolutions on the Congo issue, reiterating that the "UN Forces" should continue to take action to restore so-called "law and order" in the Congo, and demanding that all UN member states "voluntarily provide funds" for the US-controlled UN activities in the Congo. After the joint proposal by Tunisia and other countries was put forward, US Representative Wadsworth announced that he would not insist on the US proposal.

Soviet Representative and Deputy Foreign Minister Zorin proposed an amendment to this joint proposal, requesting that the proposal include non-interference in the internal affairs of the Congo and emphasize the role of the Congolese central government in guaranteeing the territorial integrity and political independence of the Republic of the Congo. However, the Soviet amendment was again rejected by the US voting machine. Finally, the Soviet representative exercised the veto power of a permanent member of the Security Council and vetoed this joint proposal that was actively supported by the United States. The result of the vote was the Soviet Union and Poland against, France abstained, and the remaining seven votes in favor.

After the vote on this joint proposal, the Soviet representative spoke, condemning the Western colonialist countries headed by the United States for using the voting machine to obstruct the Security Council from passing resolutions to safeguard the political independence and territorial integrity of the Congo.

In view of the failure to force the Security Council to pass this joint proposal that was completely beneficial to the United States, US Representative Wadsworth, ignoring the UN convention that convening a UN emergency General Assembly must obtain the unanimous consent of the five permanent members of the Security Council, illegally demanded that the Security Council pass a resolution to convene a UN emergency General Assembly to discuss the Congo issue. He clamored, "We cannot admit defeat because of the Soviet veto." With the help of the US voting machine, the US proposal was "passed" by eight votes to two (Soviet Union and Poland against), with the French representative abstaining. Under the manipulation of the United States, the Security Council finally decided to hold a UN emergency General Assembly at 8:00 PM New York time today, with 82 countries participating, to discuss the Congo situation.

Soviet Representative Zorin then spoke, severely condemning this illegal activity by the United States. Zorin pointed out that the reason why the United States is hurriedly demanding an emergency General Assembly two days before the 15th session of the UN General Assembly is to take advantage of the opportunity before many newly independent African countries have obtained representation in the United Nations to discuss the Congo issue.

Xinhua News Agency, New York, 17th: According to TASS, New York, 17th: Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Zorin wrote to UN Secretary-General Hammarskjöld on September 16, requesting that the issue of "threats to the political independence and territorial integrity of the Republic of the Congo" be included as an urgent and important issue on the agenda of the 15th session of the UN General Assembly.

Zorin also handed Hammarskjöld a memorandum, which stated that the Soviet government believes that it is necessary to submit the issue of "threats to the political independence and territorial integrity of the Republic of the Congo" as an urgent and important issue to the 15th session of the UN General Assembly because the situation in the Republic of the Congo not only remains tense but is also becoming increasingly serious.

The memorandum stated that the aggression against the Congo and the hotbed of tension created in this country is not merely a local conflict. The issue of stopping aggression and normalizing the situation in the Congo, as well as the issue of whether to guarantee conditions for the Congolese people to engage in peaceful labor and independent survival, is of great significance to the entire Africa and the world. The UN General Assembly should immediately discuss this issue to ensure the normalization of the situation in the Republic of the Congo and to safeguard the integrity and independence of the Congolese nation.

### 美国加紧利用联合国干涉刚果  操纵多数票非法迫使安理会决议召开联合国紧急大会  以便在非洲新独立国家取得代表权之前讨论刚果问题

    美国加紧利用联合国干涉刚果
    操纵多数票非法迫使安理会决议召开联合国紧急大会
    以便在非洲新独立国家取得代表权之前讨论刚果问题
    新华社17日讯　纽约消息：联合国安全理事会今天早晨结束了讨论刚果局势的会议。美国代表以非法手段胁迫安理会多数理事国通过一项决议，要求联合国举行紧急大会讨论刚果局势，美国这一行动的目的是企图利用表决机器强使大会支持美国在刚果的侵略行动。
    在昨天继续举行的安理会会议上，美国代表开动表决机器悍然否决了苏联15日就刚果局势提出的提案。苏联提案要求立即制止对刚果共和国的各种形式的干涉，并且撤销完全受美国控制的在刚果的“联合国军”司令部。对苏联提案表决的结果是：两票赞成（苏联、波兰）、七票反对（美、英、法、意大利、阿根廷、厄瓜多尔及蒋介石分子）、两票弃权（锡兰、突尼斯）。
    接着美国就积极支持突尼斯等国提出的一项联合提案。这项提案同15日提出的美国提案实质上是相同的，它要求安理会授权联合国秘书长哈马舍尔德“继续努力执行”安理会关于刚果问题的决议，重申要“联合国军”继续采取行动在刚果恢复所谓“法律和秩序”，并且要求一切联合国成员国为美国控制的联合国在刚果的活动“自愿提供款项”。在突尼斯等国的联合提案提出后，美国代表华兹沃斯宣布他将不坚持美国所提出的提案。
    苏联代表、苏联外交部副部长佐林对这项联合提案提出修正案，要求在这项提案中增加不干涉刚果内政并且强调刚果中央政府在保证刚果共和国领土完整和政治独立中的作用等内容。但是苏联的修正案又遭到美国表决机器的否决。最后，苏联代表行使了安理会常任理事国的否决权，否决了受到美国积极支持的这项联合提案。表决的结果是苏联、波兰反对，法国弃权，其余七票赞成。
    在表决这项联合提案之后，苏联代表发言谴责以美国为首的西方殖民主义国家利用表决机器阻挠安理会通过维护刚果政治独立和领土完整的决议。
    鉴于迫使安理会通过完全有利于美国的这项联合提案未能得逞，美国代表华兹沃斯不顾联合国关于召开联合国紧急大会必须获得安理会五个常任理事国一致同意的惯例，非法要求安理会通过决议召开联合国紧急大会讨论刚果问题。他叫嚷说，“我们不能由于苏联的否决就承认失败。”在美国的表决机器的帮助下，美国提案以八票对两票（苏联和波兰反对）被“通过”，法国代表弃权。在美国操纵下，安理会最后决定在纽约时间今天下午八时举行由八十二国参加的联合国紧急大会讨论刚果局势。
    苏联代表佐林接着发言，严厉谴责美国这一非法活动。佐林指出，美国所以急急忙忙要求在联大十五届大会前两天举行紧急大会，目的是想利用非洲许多新独立国家还未取得在联合国的代表权之前的机会来讨论刚果问题。
    新华社17日讯　据塔斯社纽约17日讯：苏联外交部副部长佐林9月16日写信给联合国秘书长哈马舍尔德，要求把“关于威胁刚果共和国政治独立和领土完整”的问题作为紧急和重要的问题列入联合国大会第十五届会议的议程。
    佐林还随信交给哈马舍尔德一份备忘录，备忘录中说，苏联政府认为把“关于威胁刚果共和国政治独立和领土完整”的问题作为紧急的和重要的问题提交联合国大会第十五届会议讨论是必要的。因为刚果共和国的局势不仅继续保持紧张，而且越来越严重了。
    备忘录说，对刚果的侵略和在这个国家造成紧张局势的温床不是一个仅仅局部性的冲突。制止侵略和使刚果局势正常化的问题以及是否保障刚果人民进行和平劳动和独立生存的条件的问题，对整个非洲和全世界都具有重大的意义。联合国大会应当立即讨论这个问题以保证刚果共和国的局势正常化和保障刚果国家的完整和独立。
