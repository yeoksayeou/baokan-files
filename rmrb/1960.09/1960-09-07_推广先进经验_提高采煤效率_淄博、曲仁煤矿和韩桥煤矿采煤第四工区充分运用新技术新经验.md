Xinhua News Agency, Zibo Electric Dispatch: After summarizing the leaping forward experiences of the first seven and a half months of this year at all levels, the workers of the Zibo Mining Bureau in Shandong Province discussed and formulated the production increase and conservation plans for the last few months of this year, as well as specific guarantee measures for realizing the plans.

While discussing and formulating production increase and conservation plans, the miners focused on popularizing advanced experiences to realize the plans and launched a competition of catching up with each other. The competition between Chen Weili's coal mining team and Wei Xingtu's coal mining team at the Shuangshan Coal Mine was particularly intense. Based on actual conditions, Chen Weili's team adopted the "four circulations" working method of cyclical drilling, blasting, loading and transportation, and supporting pillars, increasing the shift output from 100 carts to 125 carts. Wei Xingtu's team, based on learning from the "four circulations" experience, creatively adopted measures such as not stopping the chute when changing shifts and not stopping the chute when taking breaks, achieving full utilization of working hours and increasing the shift output from 100 carts to 136 carts, surpassing the competition opponent. After seeing this situation, Chen Weili's team turned around and chased after Wei Xingtu's team, resulting in further increases in output.

In the competition, the miners promoted the communist style, took the initiative to help their competitors catch up with the advanced level, and jointly made progress. The production of the Bi Yuzhen repair team at the Xinbo Coal Mine was temporarily unable to rise. After the Liu Gufa repair team, which was competing with them, learned about this, they sent experienced veteran workers to teach them the advanced experience of rapid chute shifting and other advanced experiences of their team, which enabled the Bi Yuzhen team to quickly jump into the ranks of the advanced.

Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou Electric Dispatch: The Quren Coal Mine in Guangdong Province is vigorously promoting the mechanization of ground transportation, improving transportation efficiency, and continuously increasing coal transportation volume. At the beginning of this year, the Quren Coal Mine Party Committee mobilized workers to vigorously promote the mechanization of transportation and loading. By the end of June, the mine had basically achieved mechanization and semi-mechanization of the ground transportation network and main loading lines, which greatly shortened loading time and improved the turnover capacity of locomotives and vehicles. The loading line of No. 3 adit of Zhutoushan used a combination of indigenous and foreign methods to build a high-platform semi-slope funnel coal bin. A belt conveyor was used to first load coal into the bin, and the train was filled at one time when it arrived. It took only 18 minutes to load a railway car, which was 27 minutes shorter than using a belt conveyor to load directly in the past. In the past, the Rongshan Work Area required more than 20 people to carry coal onto the trucks, and it took more than three hours to load a truck of coal. Now, with the use of belt conveyors and coal chutes to load coal, a train of five cars can be filled in just over an hour.

While improving transportation conditions in the mining area, the Quren Coal Mine also accelerated the construction of railway branch lines. This coal mine began constructing a railway branch line from Huanggang Station (a coal-specific station) on the Beijing-Guangzhou Railway directly to the work areas of the mining area in April last year. In order to speed up the progress of the project, they adopted the method of concentrating efforts and making breakthroughs in sections, which enabled the railway to open to traffic ahead of schedule. In this way, the entire mining area basically established a ground transportation network, connecting the mining area directly with the Beijing-Guangzhou Railway line, which greatly increased coal transportation capacity.

Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing Electric Dispatch: The Fourth Mining Area of the Xuzhou Hanqiao Coal Mine has recently achieved good results by adopting the method of "leaders taking the lead in setting examples and mobilizing the masses to make major improvements" in the process of popularizing coal loading machines, which has played a significant role in increasing coal production.

In order to fully utilize the effectiveness of technological revolution achievements in the production increase and conservation movement, recently, Duan Qicai, the Party Branch Secretary of this work area, went deep into the coal mining working face, took the lead in using coal loading machines, and worked with the workers to research and improve them, mastered the operating technology, and brought the power of the coal loading machines into full play. Then, a wave of popularizing coal loading machines was launched throughout the work area. In order to ensure the normal use of coal loading machines and improve efficiency, the Party Branch of the work area successively held several workers' symposiums, identified problems, found key points, and studied measures to address the key points one by one, and made seven improvements in the use of coal loading machines.

After the coal loading efficiency was greatly improved, contradictions arose in which processes such as backfilling and chute shifting could not keep up with coal loading. After research, the Party Branch promptly put forward the requirement of focusing on coal loading machines and vigorously promoting the matching of advanced experiences. They mobilized backfilling workers to promote the advanced experience of multi-rope backfilling, which increased backfilling efficiency by 30%; they mobilized workers to promote the advanced experience of rapid chute shifting, which also shortened the chute shifting time from six hours to three hours. At the same time, the advanced experience of four-shift cross-operation was implemented, and reforms were carried out in labor organization. In this way, the normal use of coal loading machines was guaranteed, the achievements of the technological revolution were expanded, the coal mining efficiency was more than doubled, and the average daily coal production of the entire work area increased from more than 300 tons in the past to more than 600 tons.

    推广先进经验　提高采煤效率
    淄博、曲仁煤矿和韩桥煤矿采煤第四工区充分运用新技术新经验
    据新华社淄博电　山东淄博矿务局职工在层层总结今年前七个半月跃进经验的基础上，讨论制定出了今年最后几个月的增产节约计划和实现计划的具体保证措施。
    矿工们在讨论和制定增产节约计划的同时，就围绕着实现计划推广先进经验，开展了你追我赶的竞赛。双山煤矿陈维礼采煤小队与魏兴图采煤小队竞赛得特别热烈。陈维礼小队根据实际情况采用循环打眼、放炮、装运、支柱等“四循环”的工作方法，班产量由一百车提高到一百二十五车；魏兴图小队在学习“四循环”经验的基础上，又创造性地采取了停溜子不停筐、交接班不停溜子等措施，做到了充分利用工时，班产量由一百车跃到了一百三十六车，超过了竞赛对手。陈维礼小队看到这种情况以后，又反过来追赶魏兴图小队，结果产量又有提高。
    在竞赛中矿工们发扬共产主义风格，主动帮助竞赛对手赶上先进水平，共同跃进。新博煤矿毕玉贞整修班的生产一时上不去，同他们开展竞赛的刘固法整修班知道之后，就派去有经验的老工人，向他们传授了本班快速移溜子等先进经验，使毕玉贞班很快跃居先进行列。
    据新华社广州电　广东省曲仁煤矿大搞地面运输机械化，提高运输效率，使煤炭运输量不断增长。曲仁煤矿党委今年一开始就发动职工大搞运输装车机械化。6月末这个矿就基本实现了地面运输网和主要装车线装车机械化半机械化，使装车时间大大缩短，提高了机车车辆周转能力。猪头山三号平峒装车线，用土洋结合的办法，修建了高站台半坡漏斗煤仓，用一台皮带运输机先上煤入仓，列车开来后一次装满，装一辆车皮只需十八分钟，比以前使用皮带运输机直接装车缩短了二十七分钟。荣山工区过去装篷车需要二十多人挑煤上车，装一车煤要费去三个多小时，而现在改为皮带运输机和溜煤槽装煤，一列五节车皮一个多小时就可以装满。
    在改善矿区运输条件的同时，曲仁煤矿还加快了铁路支线的修建工程。这个煤矿从去年4月就开始修筑从京广铁路黄岗站（煤炭专用站）直通矿区各工区的铁路支线。为了加快工程进度，他们采取了集中力量分段突击的办法，使这条铁路提前通车。这样就使全矿区基本上建立了地面运输网，使矿区直接和京广铁路线衔接，大大增加了煤炭运输能力。
    据新华社南京电　徐州韩桥煤矿采煤第四工区最近在推广攉煤机的过程中，采取“干部带头树样板，发动群众大改进”的方法，效果很好，对增产煤炭起了很大作用。
    为了充分发挥技术革命成果在增产节约运动中的效用，最近这个工区的党支部书记段其才深入采煤工作面，带头使用攉煤机，并同工人一道研究改进，掌握了操作技术，发挥了攉煤机的威力。接着在全工区掀起了推广攉煤机的热潮。为使攉煤机得到正常使用，并提高效率，工区党支部又连续召开了几次工人座谈会，摆问题、找关键，针对关键逐项研究措施，先后在攉煤机的使用方面作了七次改进。
    攉煤效率大大提高以后，又出现了回料、移溜子等工序跟不上攉煤的矛盾。党支部经过研究，及时提出了以攉煤机为中心，大搞先进经验配套的要求。他们发动回料工人推广多绳头回料的先进经验，使回料效率提高了30％；发动工人推广快速移溜子的先进经验，也使移溜子的时间从六小时缩短到三小时。同时，又推行了四班交叉作业的先进经验，实行劳动组织的改革。这样，既保证了攉煤机的正常使用，又扩大了技术革命的成果，使采煤效率提高一倍以上，全工区煤炭平均日产量从过去的三百多吨提高到六百多吨。
