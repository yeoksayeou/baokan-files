Xinhua News Agency, September 6th: With the peak season for agricultural product procurement approaching, commercial departments in various regions are actively establishing and improving commercial storage and transportation networks to promptly transport agricultural products into cities and deliver industrial goods to the countryside, meeting the needs of both urban and rural populations.

The original storage and transportation institutions of commercial departments were mostly established separately by various business units, such as agricultural products, production materials, non-staple foods, and department stores, with many trade units having their own warehousing and transportation institutions. After the rural people's communes were established, production became centralized and large-scale, and the dispersed nature of commodity transportation needed to be changed accordingly. Therefore, in the first quarter of this year, the Ministry of Commerce decided to establish institutions in the national commercial system to centrally handle storage and transportation business, and to establish a liaison system based on the needs of commodity circulation, so that these institutions could be organically linked together, forming a nationwide commercial storage and transportation network.

Over the past few months, commercial departments in many regions, based on the principles of facilitating commodity circulation, promoting increased production and economy, and facilitating cooperation with transportation departments, have rationally established storage and transportation outlets, mainly based on administrative divisions, combined with economic divisions. In Jiangxi Province, ninety-three of the ninety-six special districts, cities, and counties commercial bureaus have established storage and transportation stations (or sections, teams), and thirty-three transfer stations have been established in transportation hubs, with four hundred and ninety-eight collection, transfer, and allocation points established at the grassroots level, forming a commercial storage and transportation network covering the entire province. 76% of the storage and transportation points planned to be established in Guizhou Province this year have already been established.

Since the establishment of the storage and transportation network, it has shown great superiority. Storage and transportation stations in various regions have not only strengthened cooperation with transportation departments, improved the planning of commodity transfer, and mastered the movement of commodities in transit, but also saved personnel. In the past, commercial departments in various counties of Heilongjiang Province had at least five or six people handling transportation business, but now only two or three people are needed, and the quality of work has improved compared to before. The storage and transportation stations in many counties dispatched people as early as June to arrange the collection and transportation of agricultural and sideline products in advance, laying the foundation for peak season transfer.

After Leping County, Jiangxi Province, established a storage and transportation station that combined "administration and enterprise" and "warehousing and transportation," it centrally managed the storage and transportation business of the county's commercial system, with the workload increasing by about 90% compared to the original, while personnel decreased by 40%. The county also saved more than 174,000 yuan in commodity circulation costs. After Shijiazhuang City, Hebei Province, adjusted its original institutions and established a unified storage and transportation station, personnel were reduced by 20%, costs were halved, and warehouse utilization increased by 47%.

Many regions have changed some unreasonable transportation routes through the establishment of storage and transportation networks, further developed direct transportation, and effectively improved transportation efficiency. Guiding County, Guizhou Province, through the establishment of a storage and transportation network, changed six allocation routes, turning detour transportation into direct transportation, shortening the transportation mileage by 149 kilometers, eliminating six intermediate links, and shortening the time commodities spent in transit. After Liling County, Hunan Province, built a network, it changed fifty-six allocation routes, which can increase the annual transportation volume by 57,600 ton-kilometers. In the past, the native products purchased by the Wanmin'gang supply and marketing department of Wanping Commune, Yongshun County, Hunan Province, had to be carried sixty *li* to Yongshun County; now, a transfer station has been set up in the conveniently located Xin Street, and only fifteen *li* of carrying are needed to load and ship the products.

After establishing storage and transportation networks, many regions have further cooperated closely with transportation departments, so that incidental transportation has been greatly developed. According to the flow of materials, Minxian and Yongchang counties in Gansu Province built ninety-two incidental transportation points when establishing the storage and transportation network, and transported more than 5,000 tons of materials in two months, transporting all the long-term stockpiled mountain goods, bamboo and wood farm implements. Weng'an County, Guizhou Province, closely cooperated with the transportation department to seize every opportunity to use empty return vehicles and ships, and transported more than 3,900 tons of agricultural and sideline products in two months, so that there was basically no backlog of materials waiting for transportation along the transportation line.

In addition, while establishing storage and transportation networks, many regions have also rationally adjusted the use of warehousing equipment and transportation tools owned by commercial departments, fully utilized the potential of these equipments, and saved manpower, materials, and expenses.

    迎接收购旺季　加速物资交流
    各地积极健全商业储运网
    据新华社6日讯　农产品收购旺季就要到来，各地商业部门正在积极建立和健全商业储运网，以便及时把农产品调运进城，把工业品送下乡去，满足城乡人民的需要。
    商业部门原有的储运机构大多是由各业务单位分别设置的，如农产品、生产资料、副食品、百货等不少贸易单位都有自己的仓储运输机构。在农村人民公社化以后，生产是集中的，大规模的，商品运输的这种分散状况需要相应地改变。因此，商业部在今年第一季度决定在全国商业系统建立集中办理储运业务的机构，并且根据商品流通的需要，建立联系制度，使这些机构有机地联结起来，形成一个全国范围的商业储运网。
    几个月来，不少地区的商业部门本着有利于商品流通、有利于增产节约、有利于同交通运输部门协作的原则，以行政区划为主，结合经济区划，合理地设置了储运网点。江西省商业系统九十六个专区、市、县商业局，已有九十三个建立了储运站（或科、股），又在交通枢纽地区建立了三十三个转运站，基层单位建立了四百九十八个集并转拨点，形成了一个遍布全省的商业储运网。贵州省今年计划建立的储运点已有76％建立起来。
    储运网建立以后，已显示出巨大的优越性。各地储运站不但加强了同交通部门的协作，提高了商品调运的计划性，掌握了商品在途的动向，同时节省了人员。黑龙江省各县的商业部门过去至少有五、六个人办理运输业务，现在只要二、三个人就可以办理好，而且工作质量比以前提高，不少县的储运站早在6月份就派人提前安排了农副产品的集运工作，为旺季调运打下了基础。
    江西省乐平县建立了“行政与企业合一”、“仓储与运输合一”的储运站以后，集中管理全县商业系统的储运业务，工作量较原来增加了90％左右，人员却减少了40％，全县还节约商品流通费用十七万四千多元。河北省石家庄市调整原有机构，建立统一的储运站以后，人员节约了20％，费用降低一半，仓库利用率提高了47％。
    许多地区通过建立储运网，改变了某些过去不合理的运输线路，进一步开展了直线运输，有效地提高了运输效率。贵州省贵定县通过建立储运网，改变了六条调拨路线，使迂回运输变为直线运输，缩短运输里程一百四十九公里，省掉了六个中间环节，缩短了商品在途时间。湖南省醴陵县在建网以后，改变五十六条调拨线路，全年可以增加运量五万七千六百吨公里。湖南省永顺县万坪公社万民岗供销分部过去收购的土产，要挑六十华里送到永顺县城；现在在交通方便的新街设了中转站，只要挑运十五华里就可以装船运出。
    许多地区建立储运网以后，进一步和交通部门密切协作，使捎脚运输得到了更大的发展。甘肃省岷县、永昌两县根据物资流转情况，在建立储运网时，新建了九十二个捎运点，两个月中就捎运物资五千多吨，把许多长期积压待运的山货、竹木农具全部运了出来。贵州省瓮安县储运站和交通部门密切配合，见缝插针，利用回空车船，两个月中就捎运农副产品三千九百多吨，使交通沿线待运的物资基本上没有积压。
    此外，在建立储运网的同时，许多地区还合理调剂使用仓储设备和商业部门自有的运输工具，充分发挥了这些设备的潜力，节约了人力物力和费用。
