A New Type of School

In the mountain village of Bereznyki in the Transcarpathian region of Ukraine, USSR, there is a rural school with a weather station, a small observatory, a greenhouse, a poultry farm, a livestock shed, a fish pond... The students even built their own power station, which not only solves the school's electricity needs, but also provides lighting for the nearby collective farm.

Now, not only are the students achieving good grades, but almost everyone has become a "mini-expert" in certain extracurricular activities. The photos are from TASS.

    一所新型学校
    苏联乌克兰外喀尔巴阡州别列兹尼基山村有一所农村学校，它设有气象台、小天文台、温室、养禽场、畜舍、鱼池……，学生们还自己修建了一个发电站，这不仅解决了学校用电问题，而且还可供附近集体农庄照明用电。
    现在，学生们不但学习成绩良好，而且几乎每人都成了某些课外业务的“小专家”。照片为塔斯社稿
