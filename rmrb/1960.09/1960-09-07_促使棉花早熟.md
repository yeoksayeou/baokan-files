Promoting Early Maturity of Cotton
Chen Ren

To strive for a bumper cotton harvest, it is necessary to strengthen late-stage management, fully utilize the growing season, and strive to produce more and larger cotton bolls. However, cotton growth is limited by certain natural conditions, and early maturity is essential for high yields.

After the "Beginning of Autumn" (Liqiu), the weather gradually turns cold, and cotton growth will gradually weaken; after the first frost, growth will stop. Therefore, fully utilizing the effective growing period from after autumn to before the frost, striving to produce more autumn bolls, and at the same time promoting the maturity and opening of most cotton bolls before the hard frost, becomes an important link in ensuring a bumper cotton harvest. In single-cropping cotton areas in the north, frost generally occurs in mid-October; in some early-maturing cotton areas, frost occurs in late September and early October. Although the frost period is later in southern cotton areas, cotton stalks must be removed in mid-to-late October to make way for planting winter crops due to double-cropping cultivation. In the past, some high-yield cotton fields often experienced the following situation: the cotton grew very well, and many bolls were formed, but because most of the cotton bolls could not mature in time for the season, the actual harvest was not much, and even seriously reduced yields due to late maturity. Now, cotton growth has entered the stage of maturity and opening, and paying attention to promoting early maturity as soon as possible is an important matter in current cotton production.

Strengthening late-stage management of cotton fields and striving for cotton to continue to produce more cotton bolls is necessary. However, in strengthening late-stage management, if one does not simultaneously consider the limitations of the frost period and the cultivation system, and does not pay attention to achieving early maturity and timely harvesting requirements, it is also incorrect. Therefore, strengthening late-stage management of cotton fields must better grasp the principle of combining "promotion" and "control," and dialectically unify the two requirements of producing more autumn bolls and early maturity.

In order to promote cotton to produce more autumn bolls and form large bolls, appropriate fertilization and irrigation are needed in the later stage. When carrying out late-stage topdressing and irrigation, it is also necessary to pay close attention to "control" to prevent excessive water and fertilizer, resulting in lush growth and late maturity. The amount of fertilizer applied in the later stage should not be too much, and the time should not be too late. If there is drought in the later stage, irrigation should continue, but the amount of irrigation water should not be too much, and only small water irrigation in alternate furrows should be adopted; the latest time for irrigation should generally not be later than the beginning of September. In early-maturing cotton areas, the period for stopping topdressing and irrigation should be advanced.

In cotton fields with sufficient water and fertilizer conditions and vigorous cotton growth, the topping time can be appropriately delayed in order to strive to increase autumn bolls and cotton plants. However, there is a limit to delaying topping. According to the growth habits of cotton, the buds that emerge now will take twenty-five to thirty days to bloom, and another sixty days or so after blooming to mature and open. Therefore, according to general standards, the latest time for topping should not be later than seventy-five days before the frost period. If it is later than this time, the fruit branches that continue to grow, although they can also show buds, bloom, and form bolls, will become ineffective branches because they cannot mature in time. Based on the same principle, the fruit nodes and flower buds produced in the later stage of cotton plants that have already been topped should also be calculated for their growth time according to local climatic conditions, and those that cannot mature in time should be removed as early as possible. Retaining ineffective fruit branches and flower buds on cotton plants will not only not increase actual yields, but will also waste a lot of nutrients and affect the development and maturity of effective buds and bolls.

Relatively high temperatures can promote early maturity of cotton; excessive soil moisture is detrimental to cotton maturity. Strengthening late-stage intertillage of cotton fields can increase soil temperature, and in the case of high soil humidity, it can also release moisture and improve the cotton field environment. Therefore, it is an important measure to promote early maturity of cotton. If there is heavy rain in the later stage, it is also necessary to strengthen drainage in the cotton fields. In cotton fields with lush branches and leaves and heavy closure, measures should be taken to push the plants together and merge the rows to enhance ventilation and light transmission. Combined with intertillage, some of the old leaves on the main stem should be removed from bottom to top, and the empty branches on the cotton plants should be cut off. It has a certain effect on eliminating the adverse effects of shade and damp soil in the cotton field.

To strive for early maturity of cotton, it is best to prevent problems before they occur, and carry out appropriate control as early as possible to prevent the phenomenon of lush growth and late maturity.

    促使棉花早熟
    陈仁
    争取棉花丰产，必须加强后期管理，充分利用生长季节，力争多结桃，结大桃。但是，棉花生育受着一定自然条件的限制，必须早熟才能高产。
    “立秋”以后，气候渐冷，棉花的生育就要逐步减弱；到了下霜以后，生育就要停止。因此，充分利用秋后到下霜前这一段有效的生育时期，争取多结秋桃；同时促使大部棉桃在严霜前成熟吐絮，就成了保证棉花丰产丰收的重要环节。北方一熟棉区，一般在10月中旬下霜；有些早熟棉区，9月底10月初下霜。南方棉区虽然霜期较晚，但因为是两熟栽培，棉花也必须在10月中下旬拔除棉秸，腾出地来赶种越冬作物。过去一些搞丰产栽培的棉田往往出现这样的情况：棉花长的很好，桃也结的不少，但是因为大部棉桃赶不上季节成熟，结果实际收获量并不多，甚至因晚熟而严重减产。现在，棉花生育已经进入成熟吐絮的阶段，及早地注意促进早熟，是当前棉花生产上的一件重要事情。
    加强棉田后期管理，争取棉花继续多结一些棉桃，是必要的。但是，在加强后期管理工作中，如果不同时考虑到霜期和栽培制度的限制，不注意实现早熟和及时收获的要求，也是不对的。因此，加强棉田后期管理，必须更好地掌握“促进”和“控制”相结合的原则，把多结秋桃和早熟这两个要求辩证地统一起来。
    为了促进棉花多结秋桃、结成大桃，后期需要适当施肥和灌溉。在进行后期追肥和灌溉的时候，又必须很好地注意“控制”，防止水肥过量，形成贪青晚熟。后期施肥，数量不能多，时间也不能太晚。如果后期干旱，仍要继续灌溉，但灌水量也不能多，只宜采取隔沟小水浇灌的办法；最晚的一次浇水的时间，一般地区不能迟过9月初。早熟的棉区，停止追肥、灌溉的时期，还应该提早一些。
    在水肥条件充足、棉花生育健旺的棉田，为了争取增加秋桃、棉株，打顶的时间可以适当延迟。但是，延迟打顶也有一定的限度。根据棉花的生长习性，现在发出的蕾，要二十五到三十天才能开花，开花后再要六十天左右才能成熟吐絮。因之，按一般的标准，打顶最晚的时间，不宜迟过霜期前的七十五天。如果再晚于这个时间，继续长出的果枝，虽也能现蕾、开花、结铃，但因来不及成熟，都成了无效果枝了。根据同样的道理，对已经打顶后的棉株后期生出的果节和花蕾，也要依据当地气候条件，计算其生育时间，把不能及时成熟的部分，及早去掉。棉株上保留无效的果枝和花蕾，不仅不会增加实际收成，而且徒然消耗不少养分，影响有效蕾铃的发育成熟。
    比较高的温度，可以促进棉花早熟；土壤水分过多，对棉花的成熟则不利。加强棉田后期中耕，可以提高地温，在土壤湿度大的情况下，还可以发散水分，改善棉田环境，因之，是促进棉花早熟的重要措施。如果后期多雨，还必须加强棉田排涝。在枝叶繁茂、郁闭较重的棉田，要采取推株并垄的办法，增强通风透光，结合中耕，由下而上打掉主干上的部分老叶，剪掉棉棵上的空枝，对消除棉田荫蔽、土壤阴湿而带来的不利影响是有一定作用的。
    争取棉花早熟，最好是防患于未然，及早进行适当控制，防止徒长晚熟的现象发生。
