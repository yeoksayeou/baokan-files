Thinking of the Worst, Striving for the Best
Gansu Promotes Late Autumn Ripening to Avoid Early Frost Damage
Cadres Conduct Thorough Inspections of Frost Prevention Work Summarize and Promote Frost Prevention Experience Prepare Frost Prevention Materials Early

(Our newspaper Lanzhou, September 11th) While strengthening autumn field management and promoting the early ripening of late autumn crops, various regions in Gansu Province are actively carrying out frost and freeze prevention preparations.

In light of the characteristics that this year's autumn field area has expanded province-wide, there are more replanted crops, some autumn fields are still green and ripening late, and climate changes are significant, with the possibility of earlier frost than in previous years, Party committees at all levels have attached importance to and arranged autumn field frost and freeze prevention work early. The Pingliang and Zhangye special districts have issued instructions to the communes and production teams to make preparations for frost and freeze prevention. Leading comrades from meteorological departments at the provincial, special district, county, and commune levels have participated in the front lines to personally grasp this work.

Conscientiously strengthen meteorological forecasting to better serve agriculture. The Provincial Meteorological Bureau has dispatched more than 20 people to various special districts to help local areas do a good job in frost forecasting. According to a survey by the Zhangye Special District, 12 out of 13 counties and cities have already made forecasts of the time of the first frost. The special district has also sent two meteorological work teams to cotton-growing areas such as Minqin and Gaotai, focusing on cotton, and based on past years' patterns, meteorological data, and experienced farmers' experience, they are investigating the maturity periods of various crops, classifying and arranging them, and taking different measures to prevent frost and freeze. They have summarized and promoted the most effective frost prevention methods of past years with old farmers and commune members: removing cotton leaves in mid-September and cutting off roots before frost to promote early maturity. At the same time, they are preparing materials, establishing a second line of defense, and carrying out frost prevention preparation activities. The Dahe and Huatian People's Communes in the Sunan Yugur Autonomous County, combined with the current autumn field management work, have also promptly established frost prevention headquarters with 11 frost prevention teams. Communes and teams have established frost prevention intelligence networks and prepared 340 smoke stoves. Zhenyuan County in eastern Gansu, which is prone to frost damage in past years, has already held an on-site conference on frost prevention work, trained a large number of technicians, rushed to produce smoke bombs, smoke cans, red phosphorus, and other frost prevention drugs, and stockpiled firewood. After the Wangxian Commune Party Committee in Baiyin City held an enlarged meeting, it adopted a "six fixes" system of assigning people, land, work points, time, measures, and responsibilities, with each level responsible, dividing areas to be contracted, and closely monitoring weather changes in order to promptly engage in the autumn protection battle.

    干部深入检查防霜工作　总结推广防霜经验　提早准备防霜物资
    本报兰州11日电　甘肃省各地在加强秋田管理，促进晚秋作物早熟的同时，积极开展防霜防冻准备工作。
    根据今年全省秋田面积扩大，复种作物较多，一部分秋田贪青晚熟和气候变化较大，早霜可能比往年提前等特点，各级党委及早重视安排了秋田的防霜防冻工作。平凉、张掖专区都给公社、生产队发出了作好防霜防冻准备工作的指示。省、专、县、社各级气象部门的领导同志都参加第一线，亲自抓这项工作。
    认真加强气象预报，更好地为农业服务。省气象局已派出二十多人分赴各专区，帮助各地作好防霜预报。据张掖专区检查，在十三个县、市中，有十二个县、市已经作出了早霜出现的时间预报。专区并派出两个气象工作组，去民勤、高台等植棉区，以棉花为主，根据历年规律、气象资料、老农经验，调查各类作物成熟期，分类排队，采取不同措施预防霜、冻。他们和老农、社员一道总结推广了历年防霜最有效的办法：在9月中旬给棉花打叶，霜前断根，促进早熟。一面又作好物资准备，设立第二道防线，开展防霜准备活动。肃南裕固族自治县的大河、华田两个人民公社结合当前秋田管理工作，还及时成立了防霜指挥部，设有十一个防霜小组，社社队队建立了防霜情报网，已作好熏烟炉三百四十个。陇东历年易遭霜害的镇原县，已经召开防霜工作现场会议，训练了大批技术员，赶制烟幕弹、烟幕罐、红磷等防霜药物，储备柴草。白银市王岘公社召开党委扩大会议以后，采取定人、定地、定工分、定时间、定措施、定责任的“六定”制度，层层负责，分片包干，严密注视天气变化，以便及时投入保秋战斗。
