Xinhua News Agency, Tirana, September 22nd: The Albanian "Unity" newspaper published a commentary today entitled "The Worldwide Anti-American Tide," stating: "The struggle of the people of all countries against imperialism and colonialism is surging forward with unprecedented momentum and scale. While exposing the aggressive and provocative nature of its policies before the world, the US government openly and shamelessly proclaims that aggression and provocation are the foundation of its policy in relations with other countries. This is unprecedented and unheard of in history. In this way, it shows the world that the United States is a frenzied enemy of easing international tensions, an enemy of the freedom and independence of other countries, and an enemy of peace."

The commentary pointed out that it is clear that the United States' provocative and bellicose policies are closely linked to the interests of large capital monopoly groups. These groups want to extract the maximum profit from the production of atomic weapons and other armaments that serve war and aggression. The government is merely a tool of these monopoly groups, maintaining their interests and using its utmost strength to publicize the threat of communism to the "free world," attempting to convince the puppet governments of countries tied to the American chariot that only "alliance" with the United States can escape this "threat." American imperialism uses this stale, deceptive propaganda to justify its open interference in these countries, penetrate its capital into the economies of these countries, thereby guaranteeing its huge income, turning these countries into military bases, and suppressing the most basic democratic freedoms of these countries.

The commentary continued, saying that the people of all countries can no longer tolerate American imperialism arbitrarily manipulating their fate, trampling on their interests and national dignity. The anti-American tide is expanding powerfully, gripping the hearts of millions of people, and causing them to rise up and shake off the American shackles on their bodies. The commentary emphasized that the struggle against American policy is sweeping across continents. This is a struggle for freedom and independence, a struggle for national interests, and a struggle for democracy and peace.

　　阿尔巴尼亚“团结报”评世界人民反美斗争
　　侵略和挑衅是美国政策的基础
　　反对美帝国主义就是保卫和平
    新华社地拉那22日电　阿尔巴尼亚“团结报”今天以“全世界的反美浪潮”为题发表评论说：“各国人民反帝国主义、反殖民主义的斗争汹涌澎湃，其声势和规模都是前所未有的。美国政府在全世界面前暴露它的政策的侵略性和挑衅性的同时，公然地、最厚颜无耻地宣称侵略和挑衅是它同其他国家关系的政策的基础。这是历史上见所未见、闻所未闻的。这样，它就在世界面前表明，美国是缓和国际紧张局势的疯狂敌人，是其他国家的自由、独立的敌人，是和平的敌人。”
    评论指出，很清楚，美国的挑衅和好战的政策是同大资本垄断集团的利益紧密联系着的。这些集团要从服务于战争和侵略的原子武器和其他军火的生产中获取最大的利润。政府只不过是这些垄断集团的工具，它维护它们的利益，并以最大的力量来宣传什么共产主义对“自由世界”的威胁，力图使绑在美国战车上的国家的傀儡政府相信：只有同美国“结盟”才能摆脱这种“威胁”。美帝国主义用这种陈腐的欺骗性宣传为它对这些国家的公开干涉作辩护，把它的资本渗透到这些国家的经济之中，从而保证它的巨额收入，把这些国家变为军事基地，镇压这些国家最起码的民主自由。
    评论接着说，各国人民不能再忍受美帝国主义任意摆布他们的命运、蹂躏他们的利益和民族尊严了。反美浪潮正强有力地扩展，攫住了千百万人的心，使他们奋起摆脱他们身上的美国的羁绊。评论强调说：反对美国政策的斗争正席卷各大洲。这是争自由、争独立的斗争，是争取民族利益、争取民主和和平的斗争。
