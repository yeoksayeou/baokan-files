    Strengthen the Militant Solidarity Among Journalists of All Countries
    Jin Zhonghua, Vice Chairman of the All-China Journalists Association

    September 8th is International Journalists’ Solidarity Day. The International Organization of Journalists (IOJ) made this decision at the Bucharest Conference in May 1958. This day marks the anniversary of the murder of Julius Fučík, an outstanding Czech journalist and staunch anti-fascist fighter, by Nazi executioners in 1943. The IOJ called for the launch of Solidarity Day activities on this day, signifying the solidarity of journalists from all countries in the struggle for justice.

    Over the past two years, progressive journalists and news organizations from around the world have actively responded to the IOJ’s call, launching various activities to strengthen solidarity. They have also voiced their support for honest journalists persecuted by reactionary forces in all aspects, and extended condolences to them and their families. The All-China Journalists Association and Chinese newspapers have always attached importance to and supported these activities.

    In the past year, the struggle for strengthened solidarity among international journalists has been prominently manifested in the support for Manolis Glezos, the Greek national hero and publisher of "Avgi" ("Dawn") who suffered cruel persecution, and Henri Alleg, editor of "Alger Républicain," who exposed the heinous crimes of French colonialists. Glezos and Alleg firmly stood on the side of the just struggle, and despite the most severe persecution, they continued to voice their determination to fight. The IOJ has awarded them the International Journalism Prize. They are models for journalists fighting for justice and have earned the respect of people around the world.

    The struggle of journalists from all countries in support of Glezos exposed the destruction of democracy and freedom of the press by the Greek reactionaries with the support of U.S. imperialism. This Greek national hero, who climbed the Acropolis in the darkest days of the fascist invasion in 1941 and tore down the Nazi swastika flag, is now being sentenced using laws from the fascist era twenty years ago. Not only Glezos, but many other journalists who fought for democracy and progress have been imprisoned for long periods. Journalist Bekos has been imprisoned for more than fourteen years since his arrest in 1946; and Tromazos, Zilpinis, and others have been detained for more than ten years. Their appeals have received the support of the IOJ. Progressive journalists from all over the world unanimously demand that the Greek authorities immediately restore the freedom of these honest journalists.

    Alleg's struggle exposed the serious destruction of journalists' rights in the French colonialists' war of aggression against Algeria. "Alger Républicain," edited by Alleg, suffered persecution for a long time and was finally forced to cease publication. Under strict news censorship, this outstanding journalist exposed the inhumanity of the French invading forces in the use of torture in the Paul Aussaresses concentration camps. His book "La Question" will, like Fučík's "Notes from the Gallows," become an important document for journalists fighting for justice. This spring, the French colonialist military court brazenly sentenced Alleg to ten years in prison, which aroused serious protests from journalists and public opinion in various countries. In Algeria, there are also thirty or forty journalists who have been arrested and detained, some of whom are held in brutal concentration camps. We firmly demand that the French authorities stop the dirty war against Algeria and restore freedom to Alleg and other persecuted journalists.

    In the past year, with the rise of the national independence and liberation movements in Asia, Africa, and Latin America, the imperialists are facing the total collapse of the colonial system. While struggling frantically, they have also carried out various persecutions against journalists who stand on the side of justice. The racists of the Union of South Africa have carried out mass repression of the local indigenous people, and many journalists have also been arrested, including Brian Bunting, whose "New Age" newspaper was also closed down. The IOJ has issued a serious protest to the government of the Union of South Africa for this. In some African countries, incidents of journalists being arrested and newspapers being closed down also occur frequently. While supporting the African people in their struggle against imperialism and colonialism, we also express our deep sympathy for the persecution suffered by their journalists and firmly support their struggle.

    At the same time, we must not fail to note that in places controlled by U.S. imperialism and its lackeys, journalists are always subjected to the most severe persecution. In Turkey, under the dictatorial rule of U.S. imperialist stooge Menderes, hundreds of journalists have been thrown into prison. In areas invaded and controlled by U.S. imperialism, such as South Korea, South Vietnam, and Laos, journalists are constantly threatened. This situation shows that in strengthening the militant solidarity of international journalists, it must be recognized that U.S. imperialism is our most dangerous enemy.

    The current development of the world situation is very favorable to the common struggle of journalists from all countries. We see that honest and progressive journalists from all over the world are uniting more and more closely in the common direction of striving for world peace, democratic freedom, national independence, and social progress. The Cuban people's struggle to defend national independence and oppose U.S. imperialist aggression and interference has been supported by a wide range of progressive journalists in Latin America. The Japanese people's struggle against the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" and the Kishi Nobusuke traitorous regime has united a wide range of patriotic journalists. This united struggle for common and just goals will surely continue to develop in the future.

    On International Journalists' Solidarity Day, we, the Chinese journalists, express our condolences and firm support to all comrades on the journalistic front who have suffered persecution from imperialism and other reactionaries; at the same time, we express our respect to all comrades who persist in the struggle for peace and democracy, and for the struggle to win and defend national independence. Let us continue to strengthen our unity and strive for greater and greater victories.

    加强各国记者间的战斗团结
    中华全国新闻工作者协会副主席　金仲华
    9月8日是国际新闻工作者团结日。国际记协在1958年5月的布加勒斯特会议上作出了这个决定。这是1943年捷克卓越的新闻工作者、反法西斯坚强战士伏契克被纳粹刽子手杀害的日子。国际记协号召在这一天展开团结日的活动，它标志着各国新闻工作者在为正义事业而战斗中的团结。
    过去两年间，世界各国进步的新闻工作者和新闻组织，积极响应国际记协的号召，展开了各种加强团结的活动，并从各方面声援遭受反动势力迫害的正直的新闻工作者，向他们和他们的家属进行慰问。我国记协和报纸，一向重视并支持这些活动。
    一年来，国际新闻工作者加强团结的斗争，突出地表现在对遭受残酷迫害的希腊民族英雄、“黎明日报”社长曼诺里斯·格列索斯和揭露法国殖民主义者罪恶暴行的
  “共和阿尔及尔报”总社社长亨利·阿勒格的支持。格列索斯和阿勒格坚决站在正义斗争方面，他们在最严重迫害的情况下，还是不断地发出了坚决斗争的声音。国际记协已经把国际新闻工作者奖金授与了他们。他们是新闻工作者为正义而斗争的榜样，受到了各国人民的尊敬。
    各国新闻工作者声援格列索斯的斗争，揭露了在美帝国主义支持下希腊反动派摧残民主和新闻自由的情况。这位在1941年法西斯侵略最黑暗的日子里登上雅典城堡、把希特勒卐字旗拉下来的希腊民族英雄，现在竟被用二十年前法西斯统治时期的法律来加以判刑。不仅格列索斯，还有不少为民主与进步而斗争的新闻工作者，长期被关在牢狱中。记者贝柯斯自从1946年被捕，已被监禁了十四年多；还有特洛马佐斯、齐尔皮尼斯等，都已被关了十年以上。他们的呼声得到了国际记协的支持。世界各国进步的新闻工作者一致要求希腊当局迅速恢复这些正直的记者们的自由。
    阿勒格的斗争揭露了在法国殖民主义者侵略阿尔及利亚的战争中对于新闻工作者权利的严重摧残。阿勒格主编的“共和阿尔及尔报”，长期遭受迫害，终于被迫停刊。在严密的新闻封锁下，这位卓越的新闻工作者揭露了法国侵略军在皮阿尔集中营施用酷刑的惨无人道的情况。他所写的“苦刑囚房内的拷问”，将和伏契克的“绞刑架下的报告”一样，成为为正义而斗争的新闻工作者的重要文献。今年春间，法国殖民主义者的军事法庭悍然判处阿勒格十年徒刑，它激起了各国新闻工作者和广大舆论的严重抗议。在阿尔及利亚，还有三、四十个新闻工作者被逮捕拘禁，有的还被关在惨酷的集中营里。我们坚决要求法国当局停止对阿尔及利亚的肮脏战争，同时让阿勒格和其他遭受迫害的新闻工作者恢复自由。
    一年来随着亚、非、拉丁美洲民族独立解放运动的高涨，帝国主义者面临着殖民体系的总崩溃，他们在疯狂挣扎的同时，对于站在正义立场的新闻工作者也进行了种种迫害。南非联邦的种族主义者对当地土人大肆镇压，许多新闻工作者也被逮捕，其中包括布里安·本丁，他所主编的“新世纪报”也被封闭。国际记协为此向南非联邦政府发出了严重抗议。还有一些非洲国家中，新闻记者被逮捕，报馆被封闭的事件，也是经常发生。我们在支援非洲人民反帝反殖民主义斗争的同时，对他们新闻工作者所遭受的迫害，也表示深切的同情，并坚决支持他们的斗争。
    同时，我们不能不注意到，在美帝国主义及其走狗控制的地方，新闻工作者总是受到最严重的迫害。土耳其在美帝走狗曼德列斯的独裁统治下，有几百名新闻工作者被投在牢狱中。在美帝侵略和控制的地区，像南朝鲜、越南南方以及老挝等等，新闻工作者不断受到威胁。这种情况说明了，在加强国际新闻工作者的战斗团结时，必须认识到美帝国主义是我们最危险的敌人。
    当前世界形势的发展，对于各国新闻工作者的共同斗争，是十分有利的。我们看到，世界各国正直的进步的新闻工作者，在为世界和平、民主自由、民族独立和社会进步而努力的共同方向下，越来越紧密地团结在一起了。古巴人民维护民族独立、反对美帝国主义侵略干涉的斗争，得到了拉丁美洲广大的进步新闻工作者的支持。日本人民反对日美“安全条约”和岸信介卖国政权的斗争，把广大的爱国的新闻工作者团结在一起。这种为共同的正义目标而进行的团结斗争，今后必将继续发展。
    在国际新闻工作者团结日，我们中国的新闻工作者，向所有遭受帝国主义和其他反动派迫害的新闻战线上的同道们，表示慰问和坚决的支援；同时，向所有为和平和民主、为争取与维护民族独立而坚持斗争的同道们，表示敬意。让我们不断地加强团结，争取越来越大的胜利。
