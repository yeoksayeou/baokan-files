Xinhua News Agency, September 25th: Elisabethville News: The American-manipulated "United Nations Forces" are intensifying their interference in the patriotic struggle of the people of Katanga Province against the Tshombe traitorous clique and in defense of Congolese independence and unity.

It is reported that a company of Swedish troops from the "United Nations Forces" was dispatched to the Pueto area bordering Katanga Province and Northern Rhodesia on the evening of the 23rd, where they erected roadblocks and attempted to control transportation lines in order to cooperate with the reactionary military police of the Tshombe group in suppressing the people's patriotic struggle. It was previously reported that some of the Baluba people who initiated armed struggles in Manono, northern Katanga, recently entered the Mwenge area near Northern Rhodesia with weapons, where they launched and expanded their struggle.

According to Agence France-Presse, this action by the "United Nations Forces" is a manifestation of the "active" attitude taken after UN Secretary-General Hammarskjöld's recent new instructions to the "United Nations Forces." Hammarskjöld issued this new instruction after the people of Katanga Province launched armed struggles against the Tshombe group in areas such as Luena, Bukama, and Manono. The specific content of the instruction has not been disclosed. News said that a military advisor to Hammarskjöld arrived in Elisabethville, the capital of Katanga Province, on the 23rd, and held talks and plotted with the traitor Tshombe on the 24th. A spokesman for the United Nations refused to disclose the content of the meeting, only saying that the meeting was "secret." According to Agence France-Presse, the military advisor's trip to Katanga "seems to be closely related to the decision of the United Nations Secretary-General."

On the same day, Tshombe made even more frantic howls on Elisabethville Radio, threatening to take severe repressive measures against the insurgent people.

Meanwhile, in Leopoldville, the capital of Congo, the so-called "Commissioner Committee" appointed by Mobutu forcibly seized the Congolese Government Information Office. It is reported that although Mobutu sent troops to occupy the government building, some ministers of the Congolese central government still insisted on staying at their posts and working.

Xinhua News Agency, September 25th: Bonn News: According to the West German German Press Agency, the United States is continuing to transport troops from some countries to Congo to reinforce the "United Nations Forces" there. The news agency said that at the "request" of the United Nations, the US Seventh Fleet will transport six hundred troops provided by Malaya to the United Nations to Congo in early October. These troops will land at Matadi port in Congo.

　  蒙博托部下强行霸占刚果政府新闻处
    美国继续运送一些国家的军队去刚果增援“联合国军”
    新华社25日讯　伊利沙伯维尔消息：美国操纵下的“联合国军”正在加紧干涉加丹加省人民反对冲伯卖国集团、维护刚果独立和统一的爱国斗争。
    据报道，“联合国军”的瑞典部队一个连23日晚间被派往加丹加省同北罗得西亚交界的普韦托地区，在那里筑起路障，设法控制交通线，以便配合冲伯集团的反动军警镇压人民的爱国斗争。前已报道，曾在加丹加北部马诺诺发起武装斗争的一部分巴卢巴族人，最近携带武器进入了靠近北罗得西亚的姆温格地区，在那里展开和扩大他们的斗争。
    据法新社报道，“联合国军”这一行动是在联合国秘书长哈马舍尔德最近给“联合国军”新指示后采取“积极”态度的表现。哈马舍尔德是在加丹加省人民在卢埃纳、布卡马、马诺诺等地区展开反对冲伯集团的武装斗争以后发出这个新指示的，指示的具体内容一直没有透露。消息说，哈马舍尔德的一位军事顾问已于23日到达加丹加省省会伊利沙伯维尔，并且在24日同卖国贼冲伯进行了会谈和策划。联合国方面的一个发言人不肯透露会谈的内容，只说会谈是“秘密的”。据法新社说，这位军事顾问的加丹加之行“似乎同联合国秘书长的决定有密切关系”。
    同一天，冲伯在伊利沙伯维尔电台发出更疯狂的叫嚣，威胁要对起义的人民采取严厉的镇压措施。
    同时，在刚果首都利奥波德维尔，蒙博托任命的所谓“专员委员会”强行霸占了刚果政府新闻处。据报道，尽管蒙博托派军队占领了政府大厦，但是，刚果中央政府一些部长仍然坚持留在他们的岗位上工作。
    新华社25日讯　波恩消息：据西德德意志新闻社报道，美国正在继续运送一些国家的军队到刚果去增援那里的“联合国军”。这家通讯社说，应联合国的“要求”，美国第七舰队将在10月初把马来亚向联合国提供的六百名军队运送到刚果去。这些部队将在刚果的马塔迪港登陆。
