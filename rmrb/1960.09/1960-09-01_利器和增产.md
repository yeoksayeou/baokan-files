    Sharp Tools and Increased Production
    Wang Pu

    "If a craftsman wants to do his job well, he must first sharpen his tools." If we want to increase production, improve product quality, save raw materials and manpower in the production increase and economy drive centered on grain and steel, we must emphasize "sharpening our tools" in addition to soaring enthusiasm and necessary production conditions. "Tools" refer to equipment and implements. "Sharpening tools" means maintaining the good condition and normal operation of equipment and tools, making full use of their effective production time, and improving labor efficiency.

    A sharp knife will become dull after being used for a long time. A new machine will become less efficient after being used for a long time. Some parts will be slowly worn away, and precision parts will gradually become non-standard. This kind of change is inevitable. But people can slow down this change and maintain the normal operation of equipment through maintenance and partial renewal. If equipment and tools are not maintained or inspected regularly, it will cause accidents, affect production, and affect the life of the equipment.

    "Inspection and maintenance takes time, and the production increase and economy campaign is a race against time. Can we reduce or postpone the inspection and maintenance work? For example, a major overhaul becomes a minor repair, and a minor repair is temporarily postponed." No. If small problems with the machine are not "treated," they will become big problems. Reducing minor repairs will shorten the interval between major overhauls. Moreover, running a machine "sick" will not only reduce efficiency and lack product quality assurance, but also easily cause accidents, making production impossible. "Treating major illnesses only after ignoring minor ones" is by no means a way to race against time. If we really want to race against time, we must strengthen the maintenance of equipment and carry out planned maintenance. If we pay attention to maintenance at ordinary times and often carry out planned maintenance, preparing for a rainy day and preventing problems before they occur, the work will be very proactive. Therefore, we should regard equipment maintenance as a necessary measure and a positive factor for increasing production and practicing economy. Our task is not to consider delaying maintenance, but to consider how to strengthen regular maintenance work, extend the interval between major overhauls, and rationally arrange maintenance time, striving to minimize the impact on production, or even not affect production.

    In order to speed up equipment maintenance work, ensure maintenance quality, and train workers to learn maintenance techniques, it is very necessary. Workers can not only operate machines, but also know how to maintain and repair them. This is convenient for workers to maintain equipment at ordinary times, and also convenient for them to repair equipment themselves when there are minor problems. Of course, within an enterprise, we cannot rely solely on workers to carry out maintenance, but also set up a professional force. The task of these machine repair workshops is to inspect and repair the equipment of the enterprise. Manufacturing is also for repair services and cannot lose its original purpose. Of course, in order to give full play to the potential of equipment and manpower in the machine repair workshop, under possible conditions, it is also possible to take out a certain amount of manpower, or organize the machine repair workshops of several factories to implement "cooperation" to undertake certain manufacturing tasks. The employees who are dedicated to maintenance should give play to their initiative, and like the employees of the Central Machine Repair Plant of the Fuxin Mining Bureau, adopt the method of "serving households and repairing and distributing to the door", carry spare parts to the front line of production, and carry out equipment maintenance work together with production workers, striving to shorten the downtime for repairs, and striving to prevent problems before they occur.

    利器和增产
    王朴
    “工欲善其事，必先利其器”。要想在以粮、钢为中心的增产节约运动中增加产品产量，提高产品质量，节约原料、材料，节约劳动力，除了需要冲天的干劲和必要的生产条件以外，还必须强调“利其器”。“器”者设备和工具也。“利其器”，就是保持设备和工具的良好状态和正常运转；充分利用其有效的生产时间，提高劳动效率。
    一把利刀用久了就会变钝。一台新机器用久了就会降低效能，有的零件会慢慢被磨损掉，精密的也会渐渐变成不标准了。这种变化是不可避免的。但人们却能使这种变化缓慢下来，能通过维护和局部更新，保持设备的正常运转。如对设备和工具不加维护，不定期检修，就会造成事故、影响生产，影响设备的寿命。
    “检修要花时间，而增产节约运动是要争分夺秒的，可不可以把检修工作削减一些、推后一些？例如该大修的来个小修，该小修的暂时不修。”不行。机器有小毛病不给“治疗”，就会变成大毛病，减少了小修，就得缩短大修间隔。况且机器“带病”运转，不但效率不会高，产品质量没有保障，还容易造成事故，使生产根本不能进行。“小病不治治大病”，决不是争分夺秒的办法。果真争分夺秒，就一定要加强对设备的维护，进行有计划的检修。平时很注意维护，又经常进行有计划的检修，未雨绸缪，防患于未然，工作就会很主动。所以，我们应当把维修设备看做增产节约的一个必要措施，一个积极因素。我们的任务，不是考虑拖延检修，而是考虑怎样可以加强经常的检修工作，延长大修间隔并合理安排检修时间，力求少影响生产，甚至不影响生产。
    为了加速设备检修工作，保证维修质量，培养工人学会保修技术是很必要的。工人既能操纵机器，又懂得保养修理机器。这样，既便于工人平时维护设备，又便于在设备有点小毛病时能自己修理。当然，在一个企业内，不能只靠工人自己维修，还设有专业力量。这些机修车间的任务就是检修企业的设备，搞制造，也是为修理服务，不能丢掉本行。当然，为了充分发挥机修车间设备和人力的潜力，在可能的条件下，拿出一定力量，或把几家工厂的机修车间组织起来，实行“合作化”承担一定的制造任务，也是可以的。肩挑维修专职的职工们，要发挥主动精神，要跟阜新矿务局中央机修厂的职工那样，采取“服务到户、修配上门”的办法，携带配件到生产第一线，和生产工人一道，开展设备检修工作，力求缩短停车修理时间，力求防患于未然。
