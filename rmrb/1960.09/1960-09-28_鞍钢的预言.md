    The Prophecy of Anshan Iron and Steel
　　Wu Lü
    In March 1948, the Tianjin "Ta Kung Pao" published an article entitled "Steel Dream." The author, Guo Yan, appeared to be a personnel member of the puppet Resources Committee who was released by us during the liberation of Anshan. This Mr. Guo Yan made the following predictions about the future of Anshan Iron and Steel after the liberation of Anshan, saying: "Obviously, they have no way to handle taking over such a large factory." "They are very skilled in dealing with rural areas, but obviously very unfamiliar with cities, especially industrial cities."
    Eleven years ago, and even for quite a long time after that, there were many people who made similar remarks. When the Japanese "experts" withdrew from Anshan, didn't they also predict that "Anshan Iron and Steel can only grow sorghum from now on"? Another Japanese engineer believed that "it would take at least twenty years for the Chinese to restore the steel industry in Anshan." And a Kuomintang electrical engineer believed that "it would take forty years to restore production in Anshan."
    Whether it was "no way to handle it," "only grow sorghum," twenty years, or forty years, all these predictions have long been completely bankrupt. Anshan Iron and Steel resumed production in a very short time, and began large-scale capital construction as early as 1952. Now, Anshan Iron and Steel is one of the largest iron and steel complexes in the world. Its output has increased dozens of times compared to the Japanese occupation and the Kuomintang rule. This is probably something that the "experts" who made the above predictions could not have imagined.
    Is the restoration and construction of an iron and steel complex easy? Of course not. Mr. Guo Yan and others can find hundreds and thousands of reasons as arguments for their predictions. From the production organization and leadership of the entire enterprise to the smelting of each ton of steel and the rolling of each steel, none of them are simple matters; it takes even more time for people who are "obviously very unfamiliar." However, the time we used was so short, and the achievements we gained were so great, what is the reason? It seems that a passage in the editor's note written by Comrade Mao Zedong for the article "The Secretary Takes Action, the Whole Party Runs the Cooperatives" in the book "Socialist Upsurge in China's Countryside" can best explain this issue: "Social wealth is created by the workers, peasants, and working intellectuals themselves. As long as these people control their own destiny and have a Marxist-Leninist line, and do not avoid problems but solve them with a positive attitude, any human difficulty can be solved."
    The history of Anshan Iron and Steel's construction from ruins is precisely the history of the people who built Anshan Iron and Steel, who had mastered their own destiny, and under the guidance of the Marxist-Leninist line, did not avoid problems but solved them with a positive attitude. What is the problem? The problem is the contradiction. Contradictions are objectively existing and cannot be avoided. What is a positive attitude? For us, a positive attitude is the revolutionary scientific attitude that combines great ambition with solid hard work. With this attitude, we quickly accomplished things that others thought would take twenty or forty years to accomplish. The people who control their own destiny, the people under the guidance of the Marxist-Leninist line, their great revolutionary spirit that combines great ambition with solid hard work, this is the source of the victory of Anshan Iron and Steel's great development.
    However, all the great achievements of the past are only the beginning. Looking forward to the future of Anshan Iron and Steel, can we also make some predictions? Yes, we can. Our prediction is: The future is boundless! (Attached picture)

    鞍钢的预言
　　吴滤
    1948年3月，天津“大公报”上登过一篇题为“钢铁梦”的文章。作者郭燕，看来是在鞍山解放时被我们释放的一位伪资源委员会的人员。这位郭燕先生就鞍山的解放对鞍钢的前途作了如下的展望，他说：“显然地，他们拿下这样一个大厂，根本没有办法处理。”“对于农村，他们是驾轻就熟，很有办法，对于都市，尤其是一个工业城市，显然地生疏得很。”
    十一年前，甚至在这以后相当长的一段时间里，发这种议论的人并不是很少的。日本的“专家”从鞍山撤走时，不是也曾预言过“鞍钢从此只能改种高粱”了吗？还有一位日本工程师则认为“中国人要把鞍山的钢铁工业恢复起来，至少要二十年”。而国民党的一位电气工程师，则认为“鞍山的生产要恢复起来，需要四十年的时间”。
    “根本没有办法处理”也好，“只能改种高粱”也好，二十年也好，四十年也好，所有这一切预言，早已彻底破产了。鞍钢在很短的时间内就恢复了生产，并且早在1952年就开始了大规模的基本建设。现在，鞍钢是世界上最大的钢铁联合企业之一。它的产量，已不知比日本人统治的时候和国民党统治的时候提高了几十倍。这，恐怕是那些作上述种种预言的“专家”们确实料想不到的。
    是一个钢铁联合企业的恢复和建设易如反掌吗？当然不是的。郭燕先生者们可以找出成百上千的理由，作为自己预言的论据。大至整个企业的生产组织领导，小至每一吨钢的冶炼、每一根钢材的轧制，都不是很简单的事；对于“显然地生疏得很”的人们来说，更需要时间。然而，我们用了的时间却是这样地少，赢得的成就竟是这样地大，却是什么缘故呢？看来，毛泽东同志在“中国农村的社会主义高潮”一书上，为“书记动手，全党办社”一文所写的按语中的一段话，最能说明这个问题：“社会的财富是工人、农民和劳动知识分子自己创造的。只要这些人掌握了自己的命运，又有一条马克思列宁主义的路线，不是回避问题，而是用积极的态度去解决问题，任何人间的困难总是可以解决的。”
    鞍钢从废墟上建设起来的历史，正是掌握了自己命运的建设鞍钢的人们，在马克思列宁主义的路线指导下，不是回避问题，而是用积极的态度去解决问题的历史。什么是问题？问题就是矛盾。矛盾是客观存在的，是回避不了的。什么是积极的态度？积极的态度，对于我们说来，就是雄心壮志和踏实苦干相结合的革命的科学的态度。有了这种态度，别人认为二十年、四十年才能办到的事情，我们很快便办到了。掌握了自己命运的人民，在马克思列宁主义路线指导下的人民，他们的雄心壮志和踏实苦干相结合的伟大的革命精神，这就是鞍钢巨大发展的胜利源泉。
    然而，过去的一切伟大成就，也还只是开始。展望鞍钢的未来，我们能不能也来作一番预言呢？可以的。我们的预言是：前途不可限量！（附图片）
