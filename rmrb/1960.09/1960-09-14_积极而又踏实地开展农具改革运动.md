Vigorously carrying out the tool reform movement and realizing the technical transformation of agriculture as soon as possible is not only an effective measure to solve the current labor shortage, but also a fundamental way to improve agricultural labor productivity and implement the policy of taking agriculture as the foundation. In recent years, our Pingliang region in Gansu Province has always attached importance to the reform of agricultural tools and has made relatively significant achievements in this regard.

The Pingliang area has more than 14 million mu of cultivated land, of which mountainous areas account for 64% and plains account for 36%. There are more than 880,000 laborers, only 550,000 of whom are directly engaged in agricultural production. Each person bears an average of nearly 30 mu of cultivated land. Most of the tools are backward, and coupled with frequent freezing and drought disasters, the unit area yield of grain is very low. To fully implement the "Eight-Character Constitution" for agriculture, increase unit area yield, and strive to achieve the agricultural development program ahead of schedule, we must accelerate the realization of agricultural mechanization and change the backwardness of production tools and low labor productivity.

To Revolutionize Tools, We Must First Revolutionize Thinking

Whether or not to realize agricultural mechanization? Can agricultural mechanization be realized? How to realize agricultural mechanization? These questions have been debated in the Pingliang region. Some people with serious conservative ideas have always held a negative and skeptical attitude on these issues. In 1956, the entire region realized agricultural collectivization, and people relied on the power of the collective to achieve an unprecedented harvest, with an average grain yield of 155 jin per mu. At this time, some short-sighted people believed that grain production had already increased by 76% compared with 1949, and farmers were basically well-fed and clothed, so there was no need to continue the revolution, and whether or not to realize agricultural mechanization was irrelevant. However, we adhered to the Party's idea of continuous revolution, eliminated the reflection of this small-peasant economy thinking within the Party, and mobilized the masses to vigorously promote the agricultural tool reform movement. In the course of advancement, we were also hindered by some people with metaphysical viewpoints. They could not see the achievements created by the masses, did not understand the law of development of new things from low to high, from incomplete to complete, nitpicked and criticized the shortcomings of the mass movement, and belittled the achievements of improved tools, saying that "improved agricultural tools are not decent and can't achieve anything," and "country bumpkins can't make foreign machines." They one-sidedly emphasized that there were many difficulties, much waste, few raw materials, little equipment, and few technical personnel, and advocated that the technical transformation of agriculture should completely rely on the support of large industry.

Industry, especially heavy industry, is the material foundation for the technical transformation of the national economy. Over the past ten years, the state has provided Pingliang region with 13 combine harvesters, 94 tractors, more than 150,000 new-style animal-powered agricultural implements, 3,348 tons of steel, and 3,180 tons of chemical fertilizers and pesticides, enabling 1.6% of the land in the Pingliang region to achieve mechanized farming, which has powerfully supported agricultural production. In the future, with the development of socialist industry, the state will definitely supply agriculture with more equipment. However, we must never sit back and wait for industrial support, fail to act on our own, or even stop the mass movement to reform tools. Because the current number of equipment supplied by the state is still not large; at the same time, the terrain of the Pingliang area is complex, with mountains, rivers, plains, the arid Dongzhiyuan Loess Plateau with an altitude of more than 1,400 meters, and the humid Ziwuling forest area and Guanshan area, requiring a variety of tools; and many processes in field operations, such as weeding and topdressing, still do not have more suitable machinery to use. Therefore, the correct approach should be: while fully发挥 the role of large industry in supporting agriculture, vigorously carry out mass movements to reform the original backward agricultural tools. In this way, not only can the current labor productivity be improved, but also agricultural machinery suitable for various regions and various agricultural tasks can be created on the basis of gradual reform. Marxists do not criticize the vigorous agricultural tool reform movement, but strongly support it. After criticizing the thinking of solely relying on large industry, we adopted an attitude of enthusiastic support and active leadership towards the agricultural tool reform movement. In this way, the agricultural tool reform movement was carried out in a down-to-earth manner.

To lead this movement, we proceeded from reality, implemented the policy of combining indigenous and foreign methods, with emphasis on indigenous methods and improved agricultural tools, and mobilized the enthusiasm of the peasant masses, thereby making the agricultural tool reform movement develop vigorously. In the Great Leap Forward of 1958, the development of the movement was even more magnificent, and millions of people launched a wave of creating and reforming agricultural tools. According to the statistics of the on-site conference on tool reform held by the prefectural committee in Huanxian County, as many as 2,108 improved agricultural tools were exhibited at that time. However, at that time, because the scale of agricultural cooperatives was relatively small and the foundation was relatively weak, there were no factories in the cooperatives, and the production capacity was limited. In addition, the prefectural and county committees lacked experience in this area, which led to a situation of many creations, few finalized designs, many improvements, few popularizations, and widespread blossoming without a clear direction of attack. The wisdom of the masses has not been fully applied to agricultural production to improve labor productivity.

In October 1958, the Pingliang area realized the people's commune system, and a brand-new situation appeared in the rural areas of the entire region, which put forward new requirements for the agricultural tool reform movement, and also provided favorable conditions for the extensive and in-depth development of the agricultural tool reform movement. Since then, the agricultural tool reform movement in our region has entered a new stage. The 99 people's communes in the entire region have established 718 small agricultural tool factories, which have become the core force for uniting the masses to create and improve agricultural tools, and a base for mass production and promotion of improved agricultural tools. At the same time, each people's commune has also organized various specialized teams according to the specialties of the commune members, which is convenient for people to study technology and improve agricultural tools. The commune implements overall planning and unified leadership, thereby strengthening the Party's leadership over the agricultural tool reform movement.

Based on this new situation, we summed up the experience and problems in the previous agricultural tool reform movement, and felt that: vigorously carrying out mass movements must be combined with in-depth and specific leadership, and massive improvement and creation must be combined with timely improvement and promotion. Only the unity of quantity and quality can the results of the mass movement be quickly used in production and effectively improve labor productivity. To this end, we formulated the policy of actively leading, down-to-earth, and deeply carrying out the agricultural tool reform movement, and summarized it as "reform in sets, promote in areas."

Reform the Management System and Organize a Tool Reform Leadership Network

In the process of deeply carrying out the agricultural tool reform movement, first of all, the management system of tool reform was adjusted. From the prefecture to the county, commune, and production team, organizations for the reforming of agricultural tools were established. The prefecture established the Agricultural Machinery Bureau, and each county (city) established an Agricultural Machinery Section. The existing eleven county-run agricultural tool factories and one hundred and twenty-four commune-run factories mainly producing agricultural tools were placed under the leadership of the Agricultural Machinery Bureau and Section, as a base for producing semi-mechanized agricultural tools and more complex improved agricultural tools. In addition, organizations were established in departments such as water conservancy, land reclamation, animal husbandry, grain, transportation, and civil affairs to manage the work of tool reform, and factories of their own were set up. The water conservancy department is responsible for the research, creation, improvement, and production of tools for water conservancy construction, water lifting, and irrigation; the land reclamation department is responsible for tools for reclamation, cultivation, leveling fields, and plant protection; the animal husbandry department is responsible for tools for livestock breeding; the grain department is responsible for grain storage, preservation, and flour processing tools; the transportation department is responsible for transportation tools; and the civil affairs department is responsible for cooking tools. In this way, there are specialized management organizations (or specialized personnel) at every level, and every industry has specialized tasks and professional factories and workshops. The upper and lower levels and left and right sides form a management network for leading tool reform, and there are bases for producing and improving agricultural tools everywhere, thereby changing the phenomenon in the previous agricultural tool reform movement that many people were in charge, but none were in charge specifically, and that there were many creations, few finalized designs, and someone created but there was no place for mass production. We have achieved that there are dedicated personnel in charge of professional leadership, and leadership and management work from mass creation to sample selection, finalization, manufacturing and promotion, improvement of use, and continuous improvement is a one-stop process.

Present Topics, Clarify the Direction of Attack,
Start Early, Create and Promote First

While improving the management system, we conducted typical investigations on the labor occupied by various agricultural tasks in rural areas, and proposed that the main direction of the current agricultural tool reform is to first reform those tools that occupy the most labor, take up the most labor, are the most seasonal, and are the most backward, so as to rapidly improve labor productivity, reduce labor intensity, and effectively solve the current contradiction of labor shortage. According to our investigation in the Dongfeng Production Team of the Taichang Management Area of the Hesheng Commune in Ningxian County, this team has a total of 289 laborers, who actually completed 54,123 labor days in 1959, of which cultivation accounted for 32% of the total labor days, transportation accounted for 8.9%, livestock breeding accounted for 6%, grain processing accounted for 13.2%, the cafeteria accounted for 6.2%, and water conservancy accounted for 21.8%, totaling 88.1% of the total labor days. This team is located on Dongzhiyuan, and it took a lot of labor to dig wells last winter; the terrain is flat and the transportation is convenient, so less labor is spent on transportation. These two aspects cannot represent the general situation in mountainous areas. However, the above six agricultural tasks occupy about 85% of the total labor force in all types of regions. In this way, when we lead the agricultural tool reform movement this year, we promptly and clearly proposed that the whole Party and the whole people should work together to focus on cultivation, drainage and irrigation, transportation, livestock breeding, grain processing, and cooking, and create and reform twelve products (plowshares, seeders, gas generators, water pumps, waterwheels, noodle presses, vegetable cutters, blowers, water mills, four-in-one mills, animal-powered vehicles, and handcarts).

In order to realize this plan, we have also planned to organize four campaigns according to the needs of the agricultural season: From January to March is the first campaign, focusing on the reform and production of spring farming tools, vigorously grasping plows, seeders, and vehicles, combined with the reform of drainage, irrigation, and cooking tools. In this stage, the entire region created five types of tools such as plows and seeders, and manufactured and promoted 26,170 pieces. In addition, 89,562 vehicles were manufactured and promoted, so that this year's spring plowing ended about ten days earlier than in previous years, and good planting was achieved without missing the farming season. April to June is the second campaign, focusing on the reform and manufacture of summer harvest and autumn field management tools, vigorously grasping harvesting, transportation, threshing, and weeding tools. During this period, 15 animal-powered harvesters, 11 Qingyang No. 1 harvesters, 5,100 new-style sickles, 60,991 vehicles, 73,848 weeding tools, 831 winnowing machines, and 40,947 threshing tools were created and produced, ensuring the needs of summer harvest and autumn field weeding, and increasing labor productivity by about one time with general tools. From July to September is the third campaign, focusing on the reform of autumn harvest and autumn planting tools, while grasping fertilizer accumulation tools. From October to December is the fourth campaign, preparing to focus on grain processing tools and cooking tools, while grasping water conservancy construction and other weak links, to prepare for winter water conservancy construction and the development of diversified operations. Using this method of organizing campaigns in stages and annihilating enemies one by one to lead the mass movement, the masses can have clear goals, concentrated forces, and plans in advance, and act in advance, so that agricultural tools can wait for the season and ensure that improved agricultural tools exert the greatest effect in each agricultural season.

The achievements of the spring and summer campaigns have greatly encouraged the confidence of the masses, and now a new situation has emerged in which the enthusiasm is getting higher and higher, the creations are getting more and more, and the movement is higher than the previous one.

Cultivate Key Points, Promote Overall Development, Repeatedly Improve, and Continuously Improve

After proposing a clear main direction of attack, we implemented the working method of leaders going deep into key points, cultivating typical examples, and promoting general development. The prefectural committee selected 17 communes and production teams as key points according to the six aspects and twelve products of the main attack: trying out cooking tools in Hesheng Commune in Ningxian County, engaging in farming tools in Xihuachi Commune, engaging in livestock breeding tools in Zaosheng Commune, engaging in vehicle transportation in Tunzi Commune in Zhenyuan, engaging in processing tools in Chengchuan Commune in Jingning, engaging in water energy utilization in Pingliang City and Chongxin Commune in Jingchuan, engaging in drainage and irrigation tools in Dongzhiyuan in Qingyang, and engaging in water conservancy construction tools in Fanpo Reservoir in Ningxian County, etc. Each county and each commune also selected their own key points. For each key point, relevant departments sent full-time leading cadres and technical personnel, and also set up factories for producing this kind of tool, so that the leading cadres, technical personnel, and the masses were combined, and the creation, reform, appraisal, improvement, production, and promotion work was organized into a one-stop process. In the work, we always attack the weak links first, create one kind, appraise one kind, and then appraise another kind, so as to form a complete set. Wherever a key point makes achievements, an on-site meeting is held there to promote advanced experience and promote overall progress. In the first seven months of this year, the prefectural committee and the county committees have successively held many on-site meetings to promote the wind-absorbing stoves, two-in-one mills, and vegetable cutters in the cafeteria of the Hesheng Commune in Ningxian County, the water conservancy construction tools of the Fanpo Reservoir in Ningxian County, the water energy utilization tools in Pingliang City, and the vehicle transportation tools in the Tunzi Commune in Zhenyuan County.

In the process of promotion and popularization, there have been many new reforms and creations in various places. Therefore, the leading cadres of each key point have adopted a working method combining squatting at a point and turning to the surface, so as to concentrate the wisdom of the masses and improve the improved agricultural tools one step further. For example, the Pingliang City vertical water mill was successfully reconstructed on the basis of the original flat water mill after concentrating the experience of four units. This kind of water mill grinds 3,000 jin of flour per day, increasing the efficiency by 70% compared with the original flat water mill.

While cultivating advanced key points, we also paid attention to the transformation of backward work. For each slow-moving backward area and extremely low-efficiency backward tool, we sent special personnel to help and set a time limit to change the backward situation. For example, individual areas in Jingning still use the extremely old-fashioned hard sets and two-ox yokes for cultivating land, and use shovels for weeding. The prefectural committee sent a deputy director of the prefectural agricultural machinery bureau to be stationed and contracted, and produced 2,647 new-style plows for them, and allocated 140 tons of steel to them to make hoes and other agricultural tools, and supplied more than 56,000 jin of hemp to make soft sets, etc., and set a time limit of three months to change the original situation. After the prefectural committee grasped it for a month, the face of this area has been initially changed, and 54% of the hard sets, two-ox yokes, and shovels have been replaced by improved agricultural tools and new-style agricultural tools.

Facts have proved that the working method of combining leading cadres, technical personnel, and workers and peasants and grasping key points is the most effective way to organize the strength of the masses, open up the situation, and promote the overall situation, and is the working method of combining leaders and the masses and combining key points and general situations. Squatting at a point and turning to the surface, promotion and continuous improvement, is the process of continuous popularization and improvement. After such repeated repetitions, it is possible to realize foreign things from the indigenous, and finally manufacture applicable agricultural machinery. The birth of the Qingyang No. 1 harvester proves this truth. This kind of harvester uses less steel, has light pulling force, and is efficient, and can be produced and promoted on a large scale.

Implement the Spirit of Seeking Truth from Facts and Vigorously Grasp the Appraisal and Finalization Work

Implementing the spirit of seeking truth from facts and vigorously grasping appraisal and finalization is a key link in doing a good job in the agricultural tool reform movement. After the masses have created and reformed a large number of improved agricultural tools, they must be carefully selected: which ones are of better quality, urgently needed at present, and can be immediately produced, promoted, and used; which ones are of low quality and need to be further improved and perfected. The quality of improved agricultural tools not only affects the saving and waste of manpower and materials, but more importantly, it will directly affect the development of agricultural production. Therefore, we have adhered to the attitude of both enthusiastically supporting the pioneering spirit of the masses and realistically paying attention to practical results. Only seeking truth from facts is a serious and responsible attitude towards the mass movement. We oppose both the bourgeois master-style attitude of criticizing the mass agricultural tool reform movement and nitpicking the shortcomings of improved agricultural tools; and also oppose acting rashly, not helping the masses to study and improve, and then manufacturing in a rough and slipshod manner, mass production, and causing waste.

In order to grasp the appraisal work well, two appraisal groups were formed by prefectural party and government leaders, the Science and Technology Commission, the Planning Commission, the Economic Commission, technical personnel, and advanced elements in tool reform among the masses. Each county and each commune also drew 1,095 leading cadres, technical personnel, and masses to form 140 technical appraisal groups, dividing the areas and contracting to appraise various agricultural tools created and reformed by the masses. The appraisal group is the technical research group and the promotion group, and the process of appraisal and finalization is the process of promoting improvement. The appraisal and finalization of each tool must go through actual use, and the mechanical tools must be continuously test-run for more than 24 hours before they can be finalized and promoted. The appraisal also paid attention to the implementation of the policy of comprehensive utilization, multi-functionality of one thing, and saving materials, so as to ensure that less manpower and material resources are used to exert greater effects.

Once an agricultural tool is finalized, the appraisal group will solve the materials on the spot, and designate the factory responsible for production and manufacturing to produce and use it on time, in quantity, and in quality. At the same time, the appraisal group will also draw the detailed manufacturing drawings of the finalized improved agricultural tools, compile instructions, print them into books, and distribute them to various places for imitation, manufacture, and widespread use. Since the implementation of this one-stop leadership method of appraisal, improvement, finalization, production, and promotion, the 60 types of improved tools finalized and promoted in the prefecture this year generally have good performance, high work efficiency, long life, and low cost, and have been widely welcomed by the masses.

Grasp Materials and Equipment to the End, Promote Tools and Technology to People

The production and promotion of improved agricultural tools is the last process in the agricultural tool reform movement, and it is also the key to determining whether improved tools can exert practical effects. Therefore, this is a very important work. Creating new tools requires careful ideological mobilization work, and promoting and using improved tools also requires careful ideological work, organizational work, and solving many specific problems; otherwise, it will "fall short of success for lack of one final effort." In this regard, we have taken detours. In the past, some people created, but there were no specialized factories for producing improved agricultural tools. Therefore, either it was impossible to produce, or the task of producing various large and small agricultural tools was handed over to the county-run agricultural tool factory. Some factories also disliked the fact that producing agricultural tools was fragmented, the output value was small, and the time was tight, and they could not complete the output value plan, so they were unwilling to accept it. In addition, the lack of raw materials and the lack of special personnel to teach the use of technology also caused some difficulties. We have accepted the previous experience and lessons, and in this year's production and promotion of improved agricultural tools, we have grasped the three links of ideological priority, grasping the establishment of factories, solving raw materials, and imparting technology. We have repeatedly publicized among the masses that the national economy is based on agriculture and that all walks of life must support agriculture, criticized the purely profit-seeking views of some people in industry, transportation, commerce, and other departments, and advocated that everyone do one or several good things to support agriculture, and that everyone contribute to the technical transformation of agriculture. While solving ideological problems, a batch of equipment was drawn from local state-owned factories and mines to help communes newly establish a batch of agricultural tool factories, totaling 230 including the original ones, as a base for producing improved agricultural tools. The production tasks are divided into levels: the prefectural machinery factory produces technically complex agricultural machinery such as gas generators and water pumps; the county-run agricultural tool factories and machinery factories are responsible for producing large and medium-sized semi-mechanized tools such as harvesters and threshers; large and medium-sized agricultural tools with relatively simple technology such as vehicles, plows, and seeders are contracted and supplied by commune-run factories; and the production and repair of general medium and small agricultural tools are the responsibility of the agricultural tool repair factories and groups operated by the brigade and production team. In addition, water conservancy, animal husbandry, and other departments have also set up 99 factories, specializing in producing tools contracted by the system. After implementing this method of hierarchical division and specialized management of production and promotion, the tasks have been implemented, each level of factory and group has been assigned to its own place, and the potential of each enterprise and the production enthusiasm of each person can be fully发挥ed, and the tasks assigned to them can be successfully completed.

In solving the problem of raw materials, we have implemented the policy of mainly relying on our own efforts, and adopted the method of finding what is lacking, building what can be built, and finding things to replace what cannot be built, to solve the difficulty of insufficient raw materials. For example, Jingchuan County draws people to mine and smelt iron during the slack farming season, produce it themselves, and use it themselves. Many places use scrap iron to smelt into good iron, and cut down trees to saw wood to solve the problem of raw materials. At the same time, this year the state has allocated 1,324 tons of steel to the Pingliang area, various factories have saved a lot of scraps, and the commercial system has launched a clearing movement, clearing out more than 600 kinds of materials and more than 1.71 million parts to support the needs of agricultural tool reform. We use this method of mainly relying on our own efforts and supporting by all parties to basically ensure the various raw materials needed for agricultural tool reform.

Various places have also established technical instruction networks with agricultural tool factories and machinery factories as the core. By convening on-site meetings, holding exhibitions, holding production sports meetings, and sending people to go deep into the fields and construction sites to tour and perform, we impart the technology of using improved agricultural tools and help repair various agricultural tools, and basically achieved that whatever is promoted is taught, and new tools and new technologies are promoted to people together.

Because we have adhered to the correct policy of actively leading, down-to-earth, and deeply carrying out the tool reform movement, and the work style of seeking truth from facts, this year the agricultural tool reform movement in the entire region has entered a new stage of reforming into a trend, matching into a dragon, and promoting into an area. Its characteristics are: fast progress, wide range, and great effect. From the reform of single pieces to the reform of complete sets, from the improvement of simple hand tools to the creation of more complex semi-mechanized tools, and from seasonal assaults to the development of sustained movements. In the first half of this year, the entire region created, imitated, and improved 99 kinds of agricultural tools, promoted and used more than 850,000 pieces, generally increasing work efficiency by about one time, increasing labor productivity by 15%, which has played a great role in striving for a bumper agricultural harvest this year.

    积极而又踏实地开展农具改革运动	中共甘肃省委书记处候补书记	中共平凉地委第一书记  李正廷
    大力开展工具改革运动，尽快地实现农业的技术改造，不仅是解决当前劳力不足必须采取的有效措施，而且是提高农业劳动生产率和贯彻执行农业为基础的方针的根本方法。最近几年来，我们甘肃省平凉地区一直重视农业工具的改革，并在这方面做出了比较显著的成绩。
    平凉专区共有耕地一千四百多万亩，其中山地占64％，川原地占36％；劳动力八十八万多人，直接用于农业生产的只有五十五万人，每人平均负担耕地近三十亩，大都工具落后，加以冻旱灾害频繁，粮食单位面积产量很低。要全面地贯彻农业“八字宪法”，提高单位面积产量，力争提前实现农业发展纲要，就必须加速实现农业机械化，改变生产工具落后和劳动生产率低的情况。
    要革工具的命，必须先革思想的命
    要不要实现农业机械化？能不能实现农业机械化？怎样实现农业机械化？这些问题在平凉地区是有过斗争的。一些有严重保守思想的人，在这些问题上一直抱着否定和怀疑的态度。1956年，全区实现了农业合作化，人们依靠集体的力量夺得了空前的丰收，粮食平均亩产一百五十五斤。这时，一些眼光短浅的人，认为粮食产量比1949年已经增加了76％，农民已经基本上饭饱衣暖，用不着继续革命了，实现不实现农业机械化无关紧要。我们却坚持党的不断革命的思想，清除了这种小农经济思想在党内的反映，发动群众大搞农具改革运动。在前进中，又遭到了一些具有形而上学观点的人的阻碍，他们看不见群众创造的成就，不理解新生事物由低级到高级，从不完整到完整的发展规律，挑剔指责群众运动的缺点，贬低改良工具的成绩，说什么“改良农具不像样，搞不出什么名堂来”，“土包子造不出洋机器”，他们片面地强调困难多、浪费多、原料少、设备少、技术人员少，主张农业技术改造完全依靠大工业的支援。
    工业特别是重工业是实行国民经济技术改造的物质基础。十年来，国家已给平凉地区提供了联合收割机十三台、拖拉机九十四台、畜力新式农具十五万多部、钢铁三千三百四十八吨、化肥农药三千一百八十吨，使平凉地区1.6％的土地实现了机耕，有力地支援了农业生产。今后，随着社会主义工业的发展，国家一定会供应农业更多的设备。但是，我们决不应该因此就坐等工业支援，自己不动手，甚至停止群众改革工具的运动。因为目前国家供应的设备的数量还不多；同时平凉专区地形复杂，有山、有川、有原，有干旱的董志原等海拔一千四百多米的黄土高原，也有阴湿的子午岭森林区和关山地带，需要的工具是各种各样的；而且田间操作的许多工序如锄草、追肥等精细农活，现在也还没有比较合适的机械可以使用。因此，正确的作法应该是：在充分发挥大工业支援农业的作用的同时，大搞群众运动，改革原有的落后农具。这样，不仅可以提高当前的劳动生产率，而且能够在逐步改革的基础上，创造出适合于各个地区各种农活的农业机械。马克思主义者对待轰轰烈烈的农具改革运动，并不是非难，而是大力支持。在批判了单纯依靠大工业的思想之后，对农具改革运动就采取了热情支持、积极领导的态度。这样，农具改革运动才踏踏实实地开展起来。
    领导这一运动，我们是从实际出发，贯彻了土洋并举的方针，并以土为主，以改良农具为主，以调动农民群众的积极性，从而使农具改革运动蓬勃地发展起来。在1958年大跃进中，运动的发展更加波澜壮阔，千百万人掀起了创造和改革农具的热潮。据地委在环县召开的工具改革现场会议上的统计，当时展出的改良农具就达二千一百零八件。但在当时由于农业社的规模比较小，底子比较薄，社里无厂，生产能力有限，加以地、县委缺少这方面的工作经验，因而形成了创造多，定型少，改良多，推广少，遍地开花，而主攻方向不明的局面，还没有能够把群众的智慧充分运用到农业生产上，以提高劳动生产率。
    1958年10月，平凉专区实现了人民公社化，全区农村出现了崭新的形势，对农具改革运动提出了新的要求，同时也为农具改革运动的广泛深入的开展提供了有利条件。从此，我区的农具改革运动便进入了新的阶段。全区九十九个人民公社办起了七百一十八个小型农具厂，成为团结群众进行创造和改良农具的核心力量，成为大量生产和推广改良农具的基地。同时，各个人民公社又根据社员的专长，组织了各种专业队，便于人们钻研技术，改良农具。公社实行全面规划，统一领导，从而加强了党对农具改革运动的领导。
    根据这一新的形势，我们总结了以往农具改革运动中的经验和问题，感到：大搞群众运动必须和深入具体地领导相结合，大量改良、创造必须和及时提高、推广相结合。只有数量和质量的统一，才能将群众运动的成果迅速用到生产上去，切实地提高劳动生产率。为此，我们制定了积极领导，踏踏实实，深入开展农具改革运动的方针，并且概括为“改革成套，推广成片”八个字。
    改革管理体制，组织工具改革领导网
    在深入开展农具改革运动的过程中，首先，对工具改革的管理体制进行了调整。从专区到县、公社、生产队，都建立了专门改革农具的组织，专区成立了农业机械局，各县（市）成立了农业机械科，将现有十一个县营农具厂和一百二十四个社营的以生产农具为主的工厂划归农业机械局、科领导，作为生产半机械化农具和比较复杂的改良农具的基地。此外，还在水利、农垦、畜牧、粮食、交通、民政等部门，成立了专门管理工具改革工作的组织，并都办起自己的工厂。水利部门负责研究、创造、改良和生产水利施工、提水灌溉等方面的工具；农垦部门负责搞开荒、耕作、平田整地、植物保护等方面的工具；畜牧部门搞关于牲畜饲养的工具；粮食部门搞粮食贮存保管、面粉加工工具；交通部门搞运输工具；民政部门搞炊事工具。这样，就作到了层层有专管组织（或者专人），行行业业有专门任务和专业工厂、专业车间，上下左右组成了领导农具改革的管理网，处处、条条都有生产改良农具的基地，从而改变了以往农具改革运动中许多人都管，但都管得不具体，以及创造多、定型少、有人创造而无处大量生产的现象。作到专人专管专业领导，从群众创造到选样定型、制造推广、提高使用、不断改进的领导管理工作一条龙。
          出课题，主攻方向明确，
            早动手，创制推广在前
    在改进管理体制的同时，我们对农村各种农活占用劳力的情况作了典型调查，提出当前农具改革的主攻方向，是首先改革那些农活量最大，占用劳力最多，季节性最强而又最落后的工具，迅速地提高劳动生产率和减轻劳动强度，有效地解决当前劳动力不足的矛盾。根据我们在宁县和盛公社太昌管理区东风生产队调查，这个队共有劳动力二百八十九人，1959年实际完成劳动日五万四千一百二十三个，其中耕作占全部劳动日的32％，运输占8.9％，牲畜饲养占6％，粮食加工占13.2％，食堂占6.2％，水利占21.8％，总共占全部劳动日的88.1％。这个队位于董志原上，去冬打井花的劳动力比较多；地势平坦，交通便利，运输上花的劳动力比较少，这两方面不能代表山川地带的一般情况。但是上述六项农活，在各类地区都约占用全部劳动力的85％左右。这样，今年我们领导农具改革运动时，就及早地明确提出了全党全民齐动手，主攻耕作、排灌、运输、牲畜饲养、粮食加工、炊事等六个方面，创造和改革十二种产品
  （犁铧、耧、煤气机、水泵、水车、压面机、切菜机、吹风机、水磨、四合一磨、畜力车、人力车）。
    为了实现这一计划，我们又根据农事季节的需要，计划组织四个战役：从1月至3月为第一个战役，以改革和生产春耕农具为主，大抓犁、耧、车辆，结合进行排灌和炊事工具的改革。这一阶段全区创造了犁、耧等工具五种，制造推广二万六千一百七十件，另外还制造推广车辆八万九千五百六十二辆，从而使今年的春耕比往年提前十天左右结束，作到了种多种好，不误农时。4月到6月为第二个战役，以改革和制造夏收和秋田管理工具为主，大抓收割、运输、打碾、锄草工具。这一时期创造和生产了畜力收割机十五部、庆阳一号收割机十一部、新式镰刀五千一百张、车辆六万零九百九十一辆、锄草工具七万三千八百四十八个、风车八百三十一架、打碾工具四万零九百四十七件，保证了夏收和秋田锄草的需要，使一般工具提高劳动生产率一倍左右。从7月到9月为第三个战役，以改革秋收、秋种农具为主，同时抓好积肥工具。10月到12月为第四战役，准备以粮食加工工具和炊事工具为主，同时抓好水利施工和其他薄弱环节，为冬修水利和开展多种经营作好准备。用这种分期组织战役、逐个打歼灭战的方法领导群众运动，就能使群众目标明确，力量集中，计划在前，行动在前，作到农具等季节，保证改良农具在每个农事季节中发挥最大的效果。
    春夏两个战役的成绩，大大地鼓舞了群众的信心，现在已出现了干劲越来越大，创造越来越多，运动一浪更比一浪高的新形势。培养重点，推动全面，反复改进，不断提高
    在提出了明确的主攻方向以后，我们实行了领导深入重点，培养典型，推动一般的工作方法。地委根据主攻的六个方面、十二种产品，分别选择了十七个公社、生产队作为重点：在宁县和盛公社试办炊事工具，在西华池公社搞耕作工具，在早胜公社搞牲畜饲养工具，在镇原屯子公社搞车辆运输，在静宁城川公社搞加工工具，在平凉市和泾川崇信公社搞水能利用，在庆阳董志原搞排灌工具，在宁县范坡水库搞水利施工工具，等等。各县和各公社也都选定了自己的重点。每一个重点，都由有关部门派去专职领导干部和技术人员，并且办起了生产这种工具的工厂，作到了领导干部、技术人员和群众三结合，把创造、改革、鉴定、提高、生产、推广工作组织成一条龙。工作中都是先攻薄弱环节，创造一种，鉴定一种，然后再鉴定一种，使之配套成龙。哪个重点作出成绩，就在哪里开现场会议，推广先进经验，推动全面前进。今年前七个月，地委和各县委已先后开了多次现场会，推广了宁县和盛公社食堂的吸风炉、二合一磨、切菜机，宁县范坡水库的水利施工工具，平凉市的水能利用工具，镇原屯子公社的车辆运输工具等。
    在推广、普及的过程中，各地又有许多新的改革和创造。因此，各重点的领导干部，都采取了蹲点和转面相结合的工作方法，以便将群众的智慧集中起来，把改良农具再提高一步。如平凉市立轮水磨就是经过集中四个单位的经验，在原有平轮水磨的基础上改制成功的。这种水磨每天磨面三千斤，比原来平轮水磨提高效率70％。
    在培养先进重点的同时，我们还注意了改造落后的工作，对每个行动缓慢的后进地区和效率特别低的落后工具，都派专人帮助，限期改变落后面貌。如静宁的个别地区，至今还使用着极为陈旧的硬套、二牛抬杠耕地，用铲子锄草。地委就派专署农业机械局一个副局长去驻点包干，并为他们生产了新式犁二千六百四十七部，调拨给他们钢铁一百四十吨做锄头等农具，供应麻五万六千多斤做软套等，限期三个月改变原来面貌。地委抓了一个月以后，这个地区的面貌已经初步改观，54％的硬套、二牛抬杠和铲子已为改良农具和新式农具所代替。
    事实证明，领导干部、技术人员和工农群众相结合和抓重点的工作方法，是最有效的组织群众力量，打开局面，推动全盘的好方法，是领导和群众相结合，重点和一般相结合的工作方法。蹲点和转面，推广和继续改进，就是不断普及和提高的过程。经过这样多次反复，就可以实现土中出洋，最后制造出适用的农业机械，如庆阳一号收割机的诞生，就证明了这个真理。这种收割机，用的钢材少，拉力轻，效率高，可以大量生产推广。贯彻实事求是精神，狠抓鉴定、定型工作
    贯彻实事求是精神，狠抓鉴定、定型是搞好农具改革运动中的一个关键环节。群众创造改革出大量的改良农具以后，必须慎重加以选择：哪些是质量较好，当前急需，可以马上生产推广使用的；哪些是质量不高，有待继续提高完整的。改良农具质量的好坏，不仅影响人力、材料的节约和浪费，更重要的会直接影响到农业生产的发展。因此，我们坚持了既要无限热情地支持群众的首创精神，又要踏踏实实地讲求实效的态度。只有实事求是，才是对群众运动严肃负责的态度。我们既反对责难群众性的农具改革运动，挑剔改良农具的缺点的资产阶级老爷式的态度；也反对草率从事，不帮助群众研究提高，就粗制滥造，大量生产，造成浪费的现象。
    为了抓好鉴定工作，由专区党政领导、科委、计委、经委、技术人员和群众中的工具改革先进分子，组成了两个鉴定组，各县、各公社也抽调领导干部、技术人员、群众一千零九十五人组成一百四十个技术鉴定小组，分片包干，鉴定群众创造改制出的各种农具。鉴定组就是技术研究组和推广组，鉴定、定型的过程就是促进提高的过程。每一种工具的鉴定、定型都要经过实际使用，而且机械工具要连续试车运转二十四小时以上才能定型推广。鉴定中还注意贯彻了综合利用，一物多能，节约材料的方针，以保证用较少的人力、物力，发挥较大的效果。
    一件农具一经定型，鉴定组就当场解决材料，指定负责生产制造的工厂按时按量按质生产使用。同时，鉴定组还将定型的改良农具绘成制造详图，编写说明，印刷成册，发给各地，以便仿照制造，广泛推广使用。实行这种鉴定、改进、定型、生产、推广一条龙的领导方法以来，今年专区定型推广的六十种改良工具，一般都性能好、工效高、寿命长、成本低，受到了群众的普遍欢迎。材料、设备一抓到底，工具、技术推广到人
    生产和推广改良农具，是农具改革运动中的最后一道工序，也是决定改良工具能不能发挥实效的关键。因此，这是一件非常重要的工作。创造新工具需要作细致的思想动员工作，推广和使用改良工具同样需要作细致的思想工作、组织工作和解决许多具体问题；否则，就会“为山九仞，功亏一篑”。在这方面，我们是走过弯路的。以前有人创造，却没有专门生产改良农具的工厂。因此，不是无法生产，就是把生产各种大小农具的任务都交给县办农具厂。有的工厂又嫌生产农具零碎、产值小、时间紧，完不成产值计划，不愿接受。此外，由于原材料不足和没有专人传授使用技术，也造成了一些困难。我们接受以往的经验教训，在今年改良农具的生产推广工作中，抓紧了思想先行，抓紧办厂，解决原材料和传授技术三个环节。在群众中反复宣传了国民经济以农业为基础和各行各业都要支援农业的方针，批判了工业、交通运输、商业等部门某些人的单纯营利观点，提倡人人为支援农业办一件或几件好事，个个为支援农业技术改造出力。在解决思想问题的同时，从地方国营厂矿抽出了一批设备，帮助公社新办了一批农具厂，连同原有的共达二百三十个，作为生产改良农具的基地。实行生产任务分级划线：专区机械厂生产煤气机、水泵等技术复杂的农业机械；县办农具厂、机械厂负责生产收割机、脱粒机等大、中型半机械化工具；车辆、犁、耧等技术比较简单的大、中型农具，由社办工厂包干生产供应；一般中、小型农具的生产和修理由大队和生产队经营的农具修制厂、组负责。此外，水利、畜牧等部门还办起九十九个工厂，专业生产本系统包干的工具。实行这种分级划线和分条专管生产推广的方法以后，作到了任务落实，各级厂、组各得其所，能够充分发挥每个企业的潜力和每个人的生产积极性，顺利地完成自己分担的任务。
    在解决原料问题上，我们贯彻了自力更生为主的方针，采取缺什么、找什么，能造的就造，不能造的就找东西代替的办法，解决原材料不足困难。如泾川县利用农闲季节抽人采矿炼铁，自己生产，自己使用。许多地方用废铁回炉炼成好铁，伐树锯木解决原材料问题。与此同时，今年国家给平凉地区调拨了一千三百二十四吨钢铁，各工厂节省了许多下脚料，商业系统开展了清仓运动，清理出各种物资六百多种、一百七十一万多个部件，支援农具改革的需要。我们就用这种自力更生为主，各方动手支援的办法，基本上保证了农具改革需要的各种原材料。
    各地还以农具厂、机械厂为核心成立了技术传授网。用召开现场会、举办展览会、生产运动会和派人深入田间、工地巡回表演的方法，传授使用改良农具的技术，帮助修理各种农具，基本上作到了推广什么，传授什么，新工具和新技术一块推广到人。
    由于我们坚持了积极领导，踏踏实实，深入开展工具改革运动的正确方针，和实事求是的工作作风，因而今年以来全区农具改革运动进入了改革成风，配套成龙，推广成片的新阶段。其特点是：进展快，范围广，收效大。由单件的改革进入成套的改革，由改制简单的手工工具到创造比较复杂的半机械化工具，由季节性的突击，发展为持续性的运动。今年上半年全区共创造、仿制、改良各种农具九十九种，推广使用八十五万多件，普遍提高工效一倍左右，提高劳动生产率15％，对争取今年的农业丰收起了很大作用。
