Xushui Manages Late Autumn Crops and Wheat Planting Preparations Simultaneously
Xinjiang Guoging Commune Effectively Solves Land and Water Use Problems for Expanding Winter Wheat Planting

(Reported by our Tianjin correspondent on the 14th) The Xushui County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, in vigorously developing agriculture and grain production, is simultaneously focusing on the present, making every effort to strengthen the later-stage management of late autumn crops to strive for more production and harvest, and focusing on the future, actively preparing for wheat planting to ensure sufficient and high-quality planting.

Recently, the Xushui County Committee analyzed the county's agricultural production situation: due to vigorous efforts in water, fertilizer, management, and protection, late autumn crops are generally growing well. However, due to the impact of early drought and disasters such as floods and hail in some areas, some crops are developing later and are still growing excessively. The County Committee believes that it is currently necessary to vigorously strengthen the later-stage management of various crops. To this end, the County Committee has called on the county to carry out a "three exceed" (actual production exceeds contracted production, every item exceeds the target, everyone exceeds the quota) and "three compare" (compare field management, compare autumn harvest, compare total output) competition. In the competition, the Shangzhuang Commune's five Party Committee secretaries and 120 cadres contracted production teams, conducted field inspections and ranking of autumn crops, formulated different management measures according to the different growth conditions of the crops, and established 350 autumn field management pacesetters. After 9,510 mu of corn, cabbage, and other crops in the Nanzhang Commune suffered hail damage, the vast number of commune members did not lose heart or become discouraged, and organized 3,600 field management personnel to launch a struggle to seize grain from the heavens. At present, these crops have recovered and are growing vigorously. After watering, fertilizing, and careful management, 55,000 mu of the county's 150,000 mu of late autumn crops have been upgraded from third-class seedlings.

While strengthening the later-stage management of late autumn crops, Xushui County actively carried out preparations for wheat planting. In wheat planting, the County Committee emphasized the implementation of the principle of combining multiple planting with multiple harvests and high yield with multiple harvests, and decided to expand the wheat planting area by 120,000 mu compared with last year. In order to plant these wheat sufficiently, well, and in a timely manner, the County Committee put forward ten major measures, including deep plowing, expanding square fields, applying sufficient base fertilizer, selecting fine varieties, and rational close planting, and implemented the planting plans and measures to plots. At present, the communes are seizing the favorable opportunity before the start of the autumn harvest to concentrate superior forces to carry out a two-week great assault movement to accumulate and transport fertilizer for wheat, striving to prepare sufficient fertilizer for wheat sowing before the autumn harvest. In order to accumulate more fertilizer and transport it quickly, the Nanzhang Commune proposed a competition initiative to the communes, which was immediately responded to by the communes. A comprehensive fertilizer accumulation and transportation competition was launched between communes, teams, groups, and individuals. The land of Rongcheng and Zhangshi Communes is separated by a highway, and the commune members of the two communes launched a competition to compare manure piles and quality, chasing each other and refusing to give in. Up to now, the county has prepared 4.4 billion jin of fertilizer for wheat, an average of 6,000 jin per mu, which is more than 20% higher than in the same period in previous years, and 3.8 billion jin have been transported to the wheat fields.

In order to prevent autumn drought, the communes and teams actively prepared for drought-resistant autumn sowing. The county has repaired 286 sets of drainage and irrigation machinery, repaired 45 canals, built 5 dams across rivers, and stored 4.49 million cubic meters of water in reservoirs. A general inspection and germination test of wheat seeds was also carried out. In order to sow in a timely manner and achieve harvesting and plowing simultaneously, the county concentrated 90 tractors and 1,700 head of livestock to plow the land, and has now plowed more than 108,000 mu.

In order to strive for more grain production in the next two years, the County Committee has made specific arrangements for the "three autumns" (autumn harvesting, planting, and field management). The county is dividing the tasks into three battle lines: autumn harvesting, wheat planting, and late autumn crop management. In terms of crop management, in light of the autumn drought situation, the County Committee requires focusing on timely watering of crops such as sweet potatoes, late corn, and vegetables, requiring a general watering within seven days.

The county's autumn harvest task is 1.2 million mu, and wheat planting is 730,000 mu. It is planned to start in mid-September and complete the autumn harvest and wheat planting tasks in a one-month battle. In the first ten days, harvest 245,000 mu of early autumn crops such as spring corn and plant 350,000 mu of wheat; in the second ten days, harvest 400,000 mu of crops such as summer corn and plant 380,000 mu of wheat, completing the entire wheat planting plan. In the first half of October, harvest sweet potatoes and peanuts, and in the second half of the month, harvest cotton and vegetables and other crops. In order to do a good job in the "three autumns," the County Committee held a meeting of cadres above the level of small team leader on September 12 to make specific deployments for the "three autumns." At present, the county has completed 110,000 mu of autumn harvest and plowed 120,000 mu of land.

(Xinhua News Agency) The Guoging Commune in Jimusaer County, Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, adopted a method of combining repeated discussions with practical investigations, so that the commune's plan to expand winter wheat was not only fully implemented in the fields, but also specific and feasible technical measures were formulated for each wheat field based on different soil conditions.

During the discussion, they first grasped the two most important issues in expanding winter wheat area: water conservancy and land. According to the water accounting, the current water volume of Guoging Commune can only irrigate 1,600 mu of cultivated land day and night. After deducting the water needed for autumn fields and winter vegetables, there is still a shortage of one-third of the water needed to sow 60,000 mu of winter wheat in a timely manner. To this end, the Commune Party Committee, led by Deng Ruxin, the Secretary of the Commune Party Committee, took water conservancy cadres and experienced old farmers to the depths of the Tianshan Mountains to find water sources in an effort to increase the water volume; at the same time, they rectified and improved the watering organization and system to eliminate water leakage and waste. Over the past month, after searching, surveying, and organizing commune members to dig springs and repair canals, the original water volume that could irrigate more than 1,600 mu of land day and night has increased to more than 2,300 mu. In terms of rectifying the watering organization, each team has generally improved the full-time watering team, formulated a watering system with fixed time, fixed quality, and fixed quantity, and implemented advanced irrigation methods such as centralized rotation irrigation and frequent shallow irrigation, which greatly reduced water leakage and running water phenomena and improved water utilization rate, basically solving the problem of irrigation water for expanding winter wheat in the entire commune. While studying and solving water conservancy problems, the commune and brigades dispatched a large number of cadres to cooperate with the cadres and commune members of each team to jointly find and tap land potential. During the survey, it was found that each team could use many ridges and corner scattered plots, which could increase the cultivated land area by 10% alone; there were also some idle wasteland and virgin land, which could expand the cultivated land by 9,600 mu if they were also used. After solving the water conservancy and land problems, the commune uniformly planned and adjusted the newly added land and the original cultivated land according to the amount of original cultivated land and the labor and animal power of each team, so that the sowing plan of each of the 26 production teams in the entire commune was implemented in the fields.

As of September 2, the commune had plowed and leveled more than 12,000 mu of virgin and fallow land and stubble land, and sown nearly 5,000 mu of winter wheat.

    划分战线　具体安排　加强领导　大搞竞赛
    徐水晚秋管理和种麦准备两不误
    新疆国庆公社切实解决冬麦扩种土地和用水等问题
    本报天津14日电　中共河北徐水县委，在大办农业、大办粮食中，一手抓当前，千方百计加强晚秋作物后期管理，力争多产多收；一手抓明年，积极进行种麦准备，保证种足种好。
    徐水县委最近对全县农业生产形势进行了分析：由于狠抓了水、肥、管、保，晚秋作物一般生长良好。但由于前期干旱影响和部分地区遭受涝、雹等灾害，有些作物发育较晚，目前还在贪青生长。县委认为，当前必须大力加强各种作物的后期管理。为此，县委向全县提出了开展三超（实产超包产，项项超指标，人人超定额）、三比（比田间管理，比秋收，比总产）竞赛的号召。商庄公社在竞赛中，五名党委书记和全社一百二十名干部分包了生产小队，对秋田作物管理进行了逐块检查排队，按作物生长不同情况制定了不同管理措施，并树立起秋田管理标兵三百五十人。南张公社的九千五百一十亩玉米、白菜等作物遭受雹灾后，广大社员不灰心不气馁，组织起三千六百名田间管理大军，展开了与天夺粮的斗争。目前，这些作物已经恢复生机，茁壮生长。全县十五万亩晚秋作物，经过浇水追肥和细心管理，其中五万五千亩三类苗已升了级。
    徐水县在加强晚秋作物后期管理的同时，积极进行了种麦准备工作。在种麦工作中，县委强调了贯彻多种多收高产多收相结合的方针，决定今年种麦面积比去年扩大十二万亩。为了把这些小麦种足、种好、种得适时，县委提出了深耕、扩大方田、施足底肥、选用良种、合理密植等十大措施，并把种植计划和措施落实到地块。目前，各公社抓住秋收开始前的有利时机，集中优势力量开展了为小麦积肥送肥的双周大突击运动，力争秋收前给小麦播种备足肥料。南张公社为了多积肥快送肥，向各公社提出了竞赛倡议，马上得到各公社响应。社与社、队与队、组与组、人与人全面展开了积肥送肥对手赛。荣城和张市两个公社的土地相隔一条公路，两个公社的社员们展开了比粪堆、比质量的竞赛，你追我赶，互不相让。到目前为止，全县已给小麦准备肥料四十四亿斤，平均每亩六千斤，比往年同期多20％以上，并把三十八亿斤送到了麦田。
    为了预防秋旱，各社、队积极进行了防旱秋播的准备。全县已整修好排灌机械二百八十六台，整修渠道四十五条，拦河打坝五处，水库蓄水四百四十九万公方。并对麦种进行了普遍检查和发芽试验。为了适时播种，作到收一块、耕一块，全县集中了九十台拖拉机和一千七百犋牲口耕地，现在已耕翻十万八千多亩。
    为了争取今明两年多产粮食，县委对三秋工作作了具体安排。全县划分秋收、种麦和晚秋作物管理三条战线。在作物管理方面，根据秋旱的情况，县委要求突出抓住蕃薯、晚玉米、蔬菜等作物适时浇水、要求在七天内普浇一遍。
    全县秋收的任务一百二十万亩，种麦七十三万亩，计划从9月中旬开始，大战一个来月完成秋收和种麦任务。在第一旬内，收好春玉米等早秋作物二十四万五千亩，种好小麦三十五万亩，在第二旬内，收好夏玉米等作物四十万亩，种好小麦三十八万亩，全部完成种麦计划。10月份上半月收好甘薯、花生，下半月收好棉花、蔬菜等作物。为了搞好三秋工作，县委于9月12日，召开了全县小队长以上干部会议，对三秋工作进行了具体部署。现在全县完成秋收十一万亩，排地十二万亩。
    据新华社讯　新疆维吾尔自治区吉木萨尔县国庆公社采取反复讨论与实际调查相结合的办法，使全社扩大冬麦的计划不仅全部落实到田，而且块块麦田都根据不同的土壤状况订出了切实可行的技木措施。
    在讨论中，他们首先抓住了扩大冬麦面积中最主要的两个问题：水利与土地。根据算水账的结果，国庆公社目前的水量昼夜只能灌溉一千六百亩耕地，除去秋田和冬菜需要灌溉的水量外，要适时播好六万亩冬麦，尚缺三分之一的水量。公社党委为此一方面由公社党委书记邓如新带领水利干部和有经验的老农，前往天山深处寻找水源，设法增大水量；一面整顿和健全浇水组织和制度，杜绝跑水和浪费水的现象。一个月来经过寻找勘察和组织社员掏泉、修渠，已使原来一昼夜能灌一千六百多亩的水量，增加到二千三百多亩。在整顿浇水组织方面，各小队普遍健全了专职浇水小组，制定了定时、定质、定量的浇水制度，实行了集中轮灌、勤浇浅灌等先进灌溉方法，大大减少了漏水、跑水现象，提高了水的利用率，基本上解决了全社扩大冬麦灌溉用水的问题。在研究和解决水利问题的同时，公社和大队抽了大批干部，协同各小队的干部和社员，共同寻找和挖掘土地潜力。在调查中，发现各队还有许多地埂和地角零散地块可以利用，只此一项可增加10％的耕地面积；还有一些休闲荒地和生荒地，如果也利用起来可扩大九千六百亩耕地。解决了水利和土地问题以后，公社根据各小队原有耕地的多少，劳力、畜力的情况，把新增加的土地和原有的耕地统一进行了规划和调整，使全社二十六个生产小队的播种计划块块落实到田。
    截至9月2日，全社已犁好、整平生熟荒地和倒茬地一万二千多亩，播种了近五千亩冬麦。（附图片）
