Xinhua News Agency, 1st - Chu Tunan, President of the Chinese Latin American Friendship Association, sent a telegram today to Alvarez Ríos, President of the Cuban-Chinese Friendship Association, strongly condemning US imperialism for manipulating the Organization of American States Foreign Ministers' Meeting to pass a resolution interfering in Cuba, and expressing support for the Cuban people's heroic struggle to defend national independence and state sovereignty.

Chu Tunan's telegram stated that the Cuban people have decided to hold a grand people's rally on September 2 to strongly condemn US imperialism for using the Organization of American States to carry out barbaric and despicable interference against Cuba and the people of Latin American countries. On behalf of the Chinese Latin American Friendship Association and the Chinese people, I extend my highest respect to the heroic Cuban people who are engaged in an unyielding struggle to defend national independence and state sovereignty.

The telegram stated that the struggle of the Cuban people and the people of Latin American countries against US imperialism, to safeguard national independence, and to strive for democracy is part of the struggle of people around the world against US imperialism's policies of aggression and war, and to defend world peace. The Chinese people and all peace-loving people in the world will always stand with the Cuban people. Victory will surely belong to the heroic Cuban people and the united people of Latin American countries.

Xinhua News Agency, 1st - The All-China Women's Federation today sent a telegram to the Federation of Cuban Women, expressing firm support for the Cuban people's people's rally to be held on September 2 against the provocations of US imperialism.

The All-China Women's Federation's telegram stated that the Chinese people and women, as well as all justice-upholding and peace-loving people and women in the world, stand with the Cuban people. The Cuban people have friends all over the world, and victory will surely belong to the Cuban people who are fighting for justice!

The All-China Youth Federation and the All-China Students' Federation also sent telegrams today to the Cuban Socialist Youth League and other Cuban youth organizations for transmission to the rally held in Havana's Civica Square. The telegram stated: US imperialism shamelessly manipulated the Meeting of Foreign Ministers of American States, passing the so-called "Declaration of San José" to create a pretext for intensifying threats and interference in Cuba and other Latin American countries, once again exposing US imperialism as the culprit harming the peace and national independence of Latin American countries and undermining the unity of Latin American countries. US imperialism's attempt to use this declaration to strangle the Cuban revolution and contain the revolutionary torrent of national democracy of the Latin American people is doomed to failure. The telegram said that the Chinese people and Chinese youth and students firmly support the just struggle of the Cuban people.

    据新华社1日讯　中国拉丁美洲友好协会会长楚图南今天打电报给古巴中国友好协会主席阿尔瓦莱斯·里奥斯，强烈谴责美帝国主义操纵美洲国家组织外长会议通过干涉古巴的决议，并且表示支持古巴人民为保卫民族独立和国家主权而进行的英勇斗争。
    楚图南的电报说，古巴人民决定在9月2日召开盛大的人民大会，强烈谴责美帝国主义利用美洲国家组织，对古巴和拉丁美洲各国人民进行蛮横卑鄙的干涉行为。我代表中国拉丁美洲友好协会和中国人民向保卫民族独立和国家主权而进行不屈不挠斗争的英勇的古巴人民致以崇高的敬意。
    电报说，古巴人民和拉丁美洲各国人民的反对美帝国主义、维护民族独立、争取民主的斗争，是世界各国人民反对美帝国主义侵略政策、战争政策、保卫世界和平斗争的一部分。中国人民和世界一切爱好和平的人民永远站在古巴人民一边。胜利必属于英勇的古巴人民和团结起来了的拉丁美洲各国人民。
    据新华社1日讯　中华全国妇女联合会今天致电古巴妇女联合会，对古巴人民将于9月2日举行人民大会反对美帝国主义的挑衅表示坚决支持。
    全国妇联的电报说，中国人民和妇女以及全世界一切主持正义和爱好和平的人民和妇女都站在古巴人民的一边。古巴人民的朋友遍于全世界，胜利一定属于为正义而斗争的古巴人民！
    中华全国青年联合会和中华全国学生联合会今天也打电报给古巴社会主义青年联盟等古巴青年组织转哈瓦那西维卡广场举行的大会。电报说：美帝国主义无耻地操纵美洲国家外长会议，通过所谓“圣约瑟宣言”，为加紧威胁和干涉古巴及其他拉丁美洲国家制造借口，再一次暴露了美帝国主义是危害拉丁美洲各国的和平和民族独立、破坏拉丁美洲各国的团结的罪魁祸首。美帝国主义妄想利用这个宣言来扼杀古巴革命，遏制拉丁美洲人民的民族民主革命洪流，是决不能得逞的。电文说，中国人民和中国青年与学生，坚决支持古巴人民的正义斗争。
