Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, September 17th: The Secretariat of the Asian-African People's Solidarity Organization issued a statement here on the 15th regarding the situation in the Congo, condemning the illegal activities of UN Secretary-General Hammarskjöld and the UN's interference in the Congo's internal affairs.

The statement expressed support for Congolese Prime Minister Lumumba's efforts to defend the interests of the Congolese people and protect the Congo from imperialist conspiracies, and called on all independent Asian and African countries and peoples to respond fully to Lumumba's letters requesting military and other assistance. The statement called on all African countries that have sent troops to participate in the "UN Force" to withdraw their troops from the "UN Force" headquarters in order to defend the sovereignty and independence of the Republic of the Congo.

Xinhua News Agency, London, September 16th: Amaah, Chairman of the African Organization Committee, said here today that people can no longer tolerate the deliberate actions taken by the United Nations against the independence and integrity of the Republic of the Congo. He said that he no longer trusts the United Nations and Hammarskjöld.

Amaah announced that the African Organization Committee has decided to hold a demonstration on September 18th to protest the atrocities of the "UN forces" and Belgian colonialists in the Congo, and to fully support the legitimate government headed by Prime Minister Lumumba.

A statement issued by the African Organization Committee, which was read out by Amaah at a press conference today, expressed full support for the Lumumba government and demanded that the "UN forces" immediately and completely withdraw from the Republic of the Congo.

Matthew Jonah, Vice Chairman of the United National Independence Party of Northern Rhodesia, who had just returned from a visit to Leopoldville, said that contrary to Western newspaper reports, he personally witnessed during his recent visit that Lumumba was beloved and supported by people from all walks of life in the Congo. Jonah emphasized that many African countries also support Lumumba. Jonah said that at present, the African people believe that any war of aggression against the Congo will be regarded as a war against the entire African continent.

Xinhua News Agency, Rabat, September 17th: The main newspapers here unanimously condemned the US conspiracy to annex the Congo using the United Nations.

"Opinion Newspaper" pointed out that the development of the Congo incident showed that the Dulles policy of the United States imposing its will on the people of other countries through military intervention is once again reappearing in Africa under a new disguise.

"Opinion Newspaper" condemned the United Nations for becoming a tool for imperialism to obstruct national liberation movements. In a commentary today entitled "People of All Countries Draw Lessons from the Congo Incident," it said that the crisis in the Congo is a valuable experience for newly independent underdeveloped countries and countries that are still enslaved. Due to the strategic and economic importance of the Congo, colonial countries have exposed their conspiracies in the Congo. The Congo incident revealed what the political "independence" granted by colonialists to colonial countries in order to maintain their economic privileges really is. The newspaper pointed out that the Congo incident "has raised the awareness of the people so as not to be poisoned by the deadly poison of colonialism."

The newspaper also pointed out that the withdrawal of foreign troops is a fundamental condition for national liberation and is the only way to defeat colonialist conspiracies against national sovereignty.

Today's editorial in "Banner Newspaper" said that the reason why all imperialist countries oppose the independence and territorial integrity of the Congo is to preserve their privileges in the Congo and keep the Congo under colonial rule, even though the Congo has nominally gained independence.

The newspaper pointed out that Morocco opposes both the UN's interference in the Congo and the deprivation of the powers of the Congo's legitimate government.

Xinhua News Agency, September 17th: According to TASS, Delhi, September 16th: The "Lightning" weekly wrote in an article commenting on the Congo incident: "The United Nations has become a tool to overthrow the legitimate government of the Congo headed by Lumumba."

The article continued: "This plan was formulated by the US State Department and is being implemented by the State Department's agents working within the United Nations. It seems that the State Department has decided to deal with the Congo in the same way as it dealt with Guatemala."

The article said that the major African countries have indicated that "they consider the Congo incident to be a direct and brazen violation of African freedom by the North Atlantic Treaty Organization countries, and this violation is being carried out with the help of the United Nations."

The article said that the UN mission in the Congo has been led by a group of Americans from the very beginning. The proposal to establish this mission was put forward by Bunch, who has worked in the US State Department for many years, and the Strategic Intelligence Agency. In July, another American, McDermid, was sent to the Congo to work under Bunch. Hammarskjöld's advisor on African affairs is Vishoff, a former US State Department staff member and a veteran of the Strategic Intelligence Agency, while the entire activities of the UN mission are supervised by Hammarskjöld's assistant Cordier, through whom the US State Department has apparently been conducting its activities for the past few years.

The article further said, "The US plan is to eliminate Lumumba and have President Kasavubu take control. Washington has also formulated plans to arrest and murder Lumumba. The plan to remove Lumumba from office began with the UN authorities occupying the airport and radio station. This radio station was the only one controlled by the Lumumba government. At the time, there was also a radio station in Brazzaville controlled by the French and a radio station in Elisabethville controlled by the Belgians serving his enemies."

The article said, "The next step was to suggest that Kasavubu dismiss Lumumba and remove him from the post of prime minister. They hoped that after doing so, Kasavubu could control the Senate. But the second step failed. Lumumba replaced Kasavubu, and after he delivered a two-and-a-half-hour speech in the Senate, the Senate almost unanimously (forty-one votes to two votes) expressed its confidence in him."

The article pointed out, "Since they failed to realize their dirty political conspiracy to remove Lumumba from office, they are now preparing to carry out a military coup."

    制止美国假手联合国鲸吞刚果
    亚非人民团结组织书记处呼吁非洲国家退出“联合国军”
    非洲组织委员会决定举行示威游行抗议“联合国军”暴行
    摩洛哥“舆论报”印度“闪电”周报谴责联合国充当帝国主义侵略的工具
    据新华社开罗17日电　亚非人民团结组织书记处15日在这里就刚果局势发表声明，谴责联合国秘书长哈马舍尔德的非法活动和联合国干涉刚果内政。
    声明表示支持刚果总理卢蒙巴为保卫刚果人民的利益和保护刚果免遭帝国主义阴谋破坏所作的努力，并且号召所有亚非独立国家和人民对卢蒙巴要求他们提供军事援助和其它援助的信件作出圆满的答复。声明呼吁所有派有部队参加“联合国军”的非洲国家把它们的军队撤出“联合国军”司令部，以保卫刚果共和国的主权和独立。
    据新华社伦敦16日电　非洲组织委员会主席阿马赫今天在这里说，人们再也无法容忍联合国为反对刚果共和国的独立和完整所采取的处心积虑的行动。他说，他再也不信任联合国和哈马舍尔德了。
    阿马赫宣布，非洲组织委员会已经决定于9月18日举行一次示威游行，来抗议“联合国军队”和比利时殖民主义者在刚果的暴行，并且充分支持以卢蒙巴总理为首的合法政府。
    由阿马赫今天在一次记者招待会上宣读的非洲组织委员会所发表的声明表示全力支持卢蒙巴政府，并要求“联合国军队”立即全部撤出刚果共和国。
    刚从利奥波德维尔访问回来的北罗得西亚联合民族独立党副主席马修·乔纳说，同西方报纸的报道相反，他在最近访问期间亲眼看到，卢蒙巴是受人爱戴的，并且得到刚果各阶层人民的支持。乔纳强调指出，许多非洲国家也支持卢蒙巴。乔纳说，目前，非洲人民认为，对刚果发动的任何侵略战争都将被认为是对整个非洲大陆发动的战争。
    新华社拉巴特17日电　这里的主要报纸一致谴责美国利用联合国鲸吞刚果的阴谋。
    “舆论报”指出，刚果事件的发展使人们看到，美国用军事干涉把它的意志强加于其他国家人民身上的杜勒斯政策再一次在新的伪装下在非洲重现。
    “舆论报”谴责联合国成为帝国主义阻挠民族解放运动的工具。它在今天的一篇题为“各国人民从刚果事件中吸取教训”的评论中说，对于新独立的不发达国家和仍被奴役的国家来说，刚果的危机是一个宝贵的经验。由于刚果在战略和经济上的重要性，殖民主义国家在刚果暴露了它们的阴谋。刚果事件揭露了殖民主义者为了维护它的经济特权给予殖民地国家的政治“独立”是个什么东西。报纸指出，刚果的事件“提高了人民的觉悟，以便不让殖民主义致命的毒药所毒害”。
    报纸还指出，撤出外国军队是民族解放的根本条件，并且是击败殖民主义反对国家主权的阴谋的唯一办法。
    “旗帜报”今天的社论说，所有帝国主义国家之所以反对刚果的独立和领土完整，目的在于保存它们在刚果的特权，使刚果处于殖民主义宰割之下，虽然表面上刚果已得到了独立。
    这家报纸指出，摩洛哥既反对联合国对刚果的干涉，也反对剥夺刚果合法政府的职权。
    新华社17日讯　据塔斯社德里16日讯：“闪电”周报在一篇评述刚果事件的文章中写道：“联合国已经成为推翻以卢蒙巴为首的刚果合法政府的工具”。
    文章接着指出：“这个计划是美国国务院制定的，是由国务院的在联合国内供职的代理人来实现的。看来，国务院已经决定像对付危地马拉那样来对付刚果”。
    文章说，主要的非洲国家表明，“他们认为刚果事件是北大西洋公约组织国家对非洲自由的直接的、肆无忌惮的侵犯，这种侵犯是借助于联合国来实现的”。
    文章说，联合国驻刚果的使团从一开始就是由一批美国人来率领的。成立这一使团的主张是多年来在美国国务院工作的本奇和战略情报局提出的。7月间，又有一名美国人麦克代米德被派往刚果在本奇的手下工作。哈马舍尔德的非洲事务顾问是前美国国务院工作人员和战略情报局的老工作人员维肖夫，而对联合国使团的整个活动进行监督的是哈马舍尔德的助理科迪埃，显然，这几年来美国国务院都是通过他进行活动的。
    文章又说，“美国的计划是要消灭卢蒙巴而由卡萨武布总统来控制。华盛顿还制定了逮捕和谋杀卢蒙巴的计划。解除卢蒙巴职务的计划是从联合国当局占领飞机场和电台开始的。这个电台是唯一受卢蒙巴政府控制的电台，当时，为它的敌人效劳的还有布拉柴维尔的一个受法国人控制的电台和伊利沙伯维尔的一个受比利时人控制的电台。”
    文章说，“下一个步骤是：建议卡萨武布解除卢蒙巴的职务，撤除他的总理职务。他们指望这样做了以后，卡萨武布就可以左右参议院。但是第二个步骤未能成功。卢蒙巴代替了卡萨武布，当他在参议院发表了两个半小时的演说以后，参议院几乎一致（四十一票对二票）对他表示信任。”
    文章指出，“由于他们未能实现解除卢蒙巴职务的肮脏的政治阴谋，因此，他们现在又准备进行军事政变。”
