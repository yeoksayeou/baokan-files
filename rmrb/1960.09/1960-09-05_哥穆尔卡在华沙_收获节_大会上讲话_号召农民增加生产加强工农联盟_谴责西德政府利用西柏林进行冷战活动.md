Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, September 4th: People from all walks of life in Poland held a mass meeting at the Warsaw "Ten-Year Stadium" today to celebrate the traditional "Harvest Festival." Polish party and government leaders, including Gomulka, Zawadzki, Cyrankiewicz, and others, as well as tens of thousands of farmers from various provinces and representatives from factories and institutions in Warsaw, attended the celebration.

    Gomulka, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Polish United Workers' Party, spoke at the meeting, discussing the current state of Polish agriculture and its future tasks. He said that natural disasters have had a negative impact on Polish agriculture this year. However, thanks to the efforts of the Party and the state, as well as the farmers, the yield of four types of grain in Poland this year is no lower than last year; in animal husbandry, the number of pigs has increased by 12.5%, and the number of cattle has increased by 4%. He said that the current tasks of the government and the farmers are: to increase the yield per unit area of agriculture, increase agricultural products, develop animal husbandry, and increase the number of livestock, in order to meet the needs of the domestic market as much as possible.

    In his speech, Gomulka condemned the West German government's revanchism, its policy of revising borders, and its Cold War activities against Poland, Czechoslovakia, and the Soviet Union. He said that the West German government, which inherited Hitler's policies, is using West Berlin to conduct Cold War activities, and Poland, together with the German Democratic Republic, opposes these Cold War activities. He also said that at present, West Germany, led by Adenauer, has become a serious danger threatening peace in Europe and the world.

    Gomulka finally called on Polish farmers to increase production, strengthen the worker-peasant alliance, and build the Polish countryside into a modern, electrified, and mechanized countryside.

    After Gomulka's speech, farmers from various provinces of Poland performed wonderful folk songs and dances in the stadium.
