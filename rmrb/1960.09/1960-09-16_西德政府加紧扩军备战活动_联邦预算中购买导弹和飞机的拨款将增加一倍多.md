Xinhua News Agency, Bonn dispatch: The West German Bundeswehr is currently accelerating its armament, and the West German government's military expenditure is increasing year by year.

The "Die Welt" newspaper, in commenting on the West German government's draft new budget for 1961, pointed out that in the new budget, the funds used to purchase missile weapons and aircraft for the Bundeswehr have more than doubled, from 405 million marks to 951 million marks. The newspaper pointed out that the entire plan to arm with missile weapons and aircraft will cost Bonn 9.1 billion marks.

Due to the continuous expansion of the Bundeswehr, budgetary expenditure for personnel supplies will increase from 1.876 billion marks to 2.323 billion marks.

The "Süddeutsche Zeitung" recently quoted data from the West German "Taxpayers Association" as saying that from 1956 to 1960, West Germany's expenditure on arms expansion and war preparations totaled 53.5 billion marks. This figure does not include "a series" of expenditures related to arms expansion and war preparations, such as research and design engineering, transportation of military materials, military meteorological work, communications, etc.

Xinhua News Agency, September 14th dispatch, Buenos Aires: The West German government recently signed a contract with the Argentine National Atomic Energy Commission to exchange technical materials and equipment for five tons of nuclear fuel. This is another step by West Germany to seek production raw materials in order to complete its atomic bomb production program.

According to revelations by the Argentine "Solucion" weekly, as early as July last year, Schnur, the technical leader of the West German Atomic Energy and Power Department, went to Argentina to conduct negotiations and plan the establishment of a heavy water plant on Tierra del Fuego with an annual output of 60 tons. The plan stipulates that Argentina will provide factory buildings, land and natural gas, and West Germany will provide machinery and equipment. It also stipulates that all products from the first year and a half will be used by West Germany. Currently, West German technical experts have arrived in Argentina. In addition, West Germany is also attempting to obtain the privilege of exploiting Argentina's abundant uranium deposits.

    西德政府加紧扩军备战活动
    联邦预算中购买导弹和飞机的拨款将增加一倍多
    新华社讯　据塔斯社波恩讯：西德国防军目前正在加速进行武装，西德政府的军费开支一年比一年增加。
    “世界报”在评论西德政府1961年新预算草案时指出，在新预算中，用于为联邦国防军购买导弹武器和飞机的经费增加了一倍多，从四亿零五百万马克增加到九亿五千一百万马克。据报纸指出，用导弹武器和飞机武装的全部计划，将要波恩付出九十一亿马克。
    由于联邦国防军的不断扩大，人员给养的预算支出将从十八亿七千六百万马克增加到二十三亿二千三百万马克。
    “南德意志报”最近援引西德“纳税人协会”的资料说，从1956年到1960年期间，西德用于扩军备战的经费共计五百三十五亿马克。这笔数目中还不包括“一系列”同扩军备战有关的开支，例如研究和设计工程、军事物资的运输、军用气象工作、通讯联络等等。
    据新华社14日讯　布宜诺斯艾利斯消息：西德政府最近和阿根廷原子能全国委员会签订了一项以技术物资和设备换取五吨核燃料的合同。这是西德为完成原子弹生产计划而寻取生产原料的又一个步骤。
    据阿根廷“解决”周刊揭露，早在去年7月间，西德原子能和动力部技术领导人施努尔就到阿根廷进行商谈，策划在火地岛建立一座年产六十吨的重水工厂。计划规定由阿根廷提供厂房建筑、地皮和天然气，西德提供机器设备，同时还规定最初一年半的产品全部归西德使用。目前西德的技术专家已经到达阿根廷。此外，西德还企图取得开采阿根廷蕴藏丰富的铀矿的特权。
