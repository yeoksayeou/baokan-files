    Recording Heroic Achievements on the World's Highest Peak
    Photographer Wang Ximao
    The third march began. I carried a five-and-a-half kilogram camera and more than eight kilograms of film, panting as I climbed with the team from the 7,000-meter-high "North Col" along the snow ridge connecting Everest and North Peak. The weather changed, and the temperature plummeted to around minus 37 degrees Celsius. A Force 12 gale whipped our bodies, and the wind stung our faces like needles. Whenever the wind weakened slightly, we would move forward in unison without anyone needing to tell us. These thrilling scenes would have made for excellent shots! But the relentless wind, which could have swept us into an abyss at any moment, prevented my hands, which were tightly gripping my ice axe, from taking out the camera to film.
    As we approached the top of the snow ridge—the 7,400-meter camp—night enveloped the mountain. We could only climb upward by the reflection of the snow and the twinkling starlight. Days of marching had greatly depleted my strength. The nearly 30-kilogram backpack made it difficult to breathe, and the excessive fatigue made my thighs feel like they weighed thousands of pounds, making it hard to lift them. At this moment, I thought of the Party's teachings and concern, the trust of 650 million people, the登山队员's fearless spirit in the face of difficulties, and their high degree of class friendship and communist style in helping me carry the camera and film, and protecting me while I filmed in dangerous places. All of this gave me endless strength, and I regained my courage, using the ice slope, crawling on the ice surface on my hands and feet, moving forward inch by inch, and finally reaching the 7,400-meter camp.
    When I woke up in the morning, my hands and feet, which had been frostbitten while crossing the "North Col" ice crevasse, were discovered by team leader Qu Yinhua. He immediately reported it to Captain Shi Zhanchun. I quickly explained to the captain and tried to continue forward, but in this situation, what was the use of explaining? I had to obey orders and descend. Before returning to base camp, my camera was running again during this short and precious time. Comrades Liu Lianman and Zhang Junyan were preparing rock pitons and small hanging ladders; Comrade Wang Fuzhou wrapped the plaster statue of our most beloved leader—Chairman Mao—with a brightly colored national flag... My frostbitten hands and feet were out of control, so I had to kneel on the ground to film; but the relentless wind swayed me uncontrollably, so I simply lay on the ground and filmed these historically significant shots. The team set off, and the wind continued to blow. I moved the lens from the summit of Mount Everest to the front of the team. Suddenly, I saw in the picture that Captain Shi Zhanchun, who was leading the way, had been blown down on the scree slope, but was still working tenaciously. He only rested for a moment, then picked up his backpack, straightened his chest, and proudly climbed back up the scree slope!

    The lights in the other tents had been turned off, and everyone was resting, but the light in the team headquarters was still on. Deputy Captain of the mountaineering team and Party Committee member Xu Jing and other comrades were holding a Party group meeting. Comrades Wang Fuzhou, Qu Yinhua, and Mu Sen also participated in the meeting. They were discussing and deciding how to complete the fourth march to conquer the summit and record this great event in human history with film. At the end of the meeting, Comrade Xu Jing waved one hand excitedly and said in a loud and powerful voice: "Comrade Mu Sen's physical strength has been exhausted, and Comrade Wang Ximao has been hospitalized with frostbite. We must not only overcome all difficulties with Party spirit to ensure the conquest of the summit, but we must also use Party spirit to ensure the completion of the filming tasks that Comrades Mu Sen and Wang Ximao are unable to complete." Before Comrade Xu Jing's words had finished, the broad-shouldered and round-waisted strongman "Three-and-a-Half Tons"—Comrade Qu Yinhua—stood up abruptly and said: "In order to carry the camera to the summit, I have decided to bring one less bottle of oxygen!" Comrade Wang Fuzhou immediately added: "We can take turns carrying the camera, no matter what, we must carry the camera to the summit!"
    The comrades all knew that carrying the camera to the summit was not an easy task. At altitudes above 8,000 meters, oxygen is extremely scarce. In the past, aerial physiology said that altitudes above 8,000 meters were death zones, and people could not survive without artificial oxygen equipment! Due to the added weight of oxygen, mountaineers had to carry 30 kilograms of materials and equipment above 8,000 meters. To reduce weight, the team members weighed a rock piton and a strip of tape ounce by ounce. It was under these circumstances that they decided to carry a four-kilogram movie camera and nearly two and a half kilograms of 400-foot film for us. The comrades all knew that it was quite difficult for ordinary people to breathe at altitudes of three or four thousand meters, and they were also very clear about the degree of physiological pain caused by not using oxygen or using less oxygen at altitudes above 8,000 meters. But they still decided to endure the pain themselves to complete the filming task for us.
    On the morning of May 24, at around 9:00 AM, Comrades Wang Fuzhou, Gongbu, and Qu Yinhua carried the camera and film together, braving the biting cold wind, and set off from 8,700 meters above sea level. By the time they reached 8,830 meters, their artificial oxygen had run out. By the time they completed the most difficult journey in human history and climbed to Mount Everest at 8,882 meters above sea level, it was 4:20 AM on the 25th. At this altitude, how much effort did they have to expend for each step they took! Taking one step here is equivalent to walking half a kilometer on flat ground. Although they crawled inch by inch on the rocks in the final difficult stretch, relying on the reflection of the snow and the starlight, our camera and film accompanied the heroes all the way! The heroes felt extremely regretful that they did not capture the moment of reaching the summit at night. Unable to stay at the top for long, they had to carry our camera and film back down from the summit in a state of extreme fatigue. At this time, the weather suddenly turned bad, and snow began to fall continuously. When they returned to 8,700 meters above sea level, it was already dawn. In order to film the summit, Comrade Qu Yinhua picked up the camera to shoot two shots, but due to excessive fatigue, he was unable to stand steadily and his hands trembled. He had to sit on the hillside and, leaning against his backpack, shot a snow-covered summit and a cloud sea of the Himalayas from above.
    These two precious shots, earned with their lives, will forever be etched in people's minds, will forever be recorded in history, and will radiate brilliant and dazzling light! (Attached image)

    在世界最高峰上纪录下英雄业绩
    摄影师　王喜茂
    第三次行军开始了。我背着一台五公斤半的摄影机和八公斤多的胶片，喘着粗气和队员们一起从海拔七千米的“北坳”沿着珠峰和北峰相连接的雪脊向上爬行。天气变了，气温急骤下降到零下三十七度左右。十二级的大风掀动着身躯，脸上被风吹得像针扎一般。每当风势稍弱时，不用谁打招呼，大家就不约而同地向前移动。这些惊险的场面该是多么好的镜头啊！可是随时都会把我们掀下万丈深渊的无情大风，使我紧握冰镐的双手，不能取出机器来拍摄。
    当我们快爬到雪脊的顶端——海拔七千四百米营地的时候，夜幕笼罩了山峰，我们只能借着雪的反光和闪烁的星光向上爬行。连日的行军使我的体力消耗很大，将近三十公斤的背包压得我有些喘不过气来，过度的劳累也使我的大腿像有几千斤重似的抬不起来。这时我想到：党的教导和关怀，六亿五千万人民的重托，登山队员们蔑视困难的勇敢无畏精神和他们帮助我背机器、胶片的高度阶级友爱和共产主义风格，在危险的地方保护我拍材料等等。这一切给了我无穷的力量，使我又重新鼓起勇气，利用冰坡，趴在冰面上手脚并行，一寸一尺地向前移动，终于爬到了海拔七千四百米的营地。
    早晨起床时，我在过“北坳”冰胡同冻伤的手脚被接触组长屈银华同志发现了，他马上汇报给了史占春队长，我赶紧向队长解释和争取继续前进，可是在这种情况下，解释和争取又有什么用呢？只好服从命令下山。在返回大本营之前，我的摄影机又在这暂短可贵的时间里转动了。刘连满和张俊岩同志在准备岩石锥、小挂梯；王富洲同志用鲜艳夺目的国旗包裹着我们各族人民最敬爱的领袖——毛主席的石膏像……我冻伤了的手脚不听使唤，只好跪在地上拍；可是无情的大风刮得我摇摆不定，最后我索性趴在地下把这些有历史意义的镜头拍下来。队伍出发了，风还在不停地刮着，我把镜头从珠穆朗玛峰顶移到队伍的前面，忽然我从画面里看到开路的史占春队长虽然在浮石坡上被风掀了下来，可是还在顽强地工作着。他只休息了片刻，又背起背包，挺起胸膛，傲然地爬上了浮石坡！

    别的帐篷都已熄灯休息了，唯有队部的电灯还在亮着，登山队副队长、党委委员许竞等同志正在开党组会。参加会的还有王富洲、屈银华、牟森等同志。他们正在讨论和决定如何完成第四次行军拿下主峰，和用电影纪录下这一人类历史的伟大事件。在会议结束的时候，许竞同志激动地挥着一只手，用宏亮有力的声音说：“牟森同志的体力已消耗殆尽，王喜茂同志已冻伤住院，我们不但要用党性克服重重困难保证拿下主峰，同时也一定要用党性保证完成牟森和王喜茂同志所不能完成的登上主峰的拍摄任务。”许竞同志的话没落音，膀宽腰圆的大力士“三吨半”——屈银华同志豁地站起来说：“为了把摄影机背上顶峰，我决定少带一瓶氧气！”王富洲同志马上也接着说：“我们可以大家轮流背摄影机，不管怎么样也一定要把摄影机背上顶峰去！”
    同志们都知道要把摄影机背上顶峰并不是一件容易的事。海拔八千米以上氧气极度缺乏，在过去的世界航空生理学上说海拔八千米以上是死亡地带，没有人造氧气装备，人就不能生存！由于增加氧气负重，登山队员在海拔八千米以上要背三十公斤的物资和装备。为了减轻重量，队员们用秤一两一两地往下减着一个岩石锥和一条带子的重量。就是在这种情况下，他们决定给我们背上一台四公斤的电影摄影机和将近两公斤半的四百呎胶片。同志们都知道一般人在海拔三、四千米的地方呼吸都相当困难，而他们也十分清楚地知道在海拔八千米以上不用氧气和少用氧气在生理上所引起的痛苦程度。但他们仍然决定自己忍受痛苦为我们完成拍摄任务。
    5月24日早晨九点多钟，王富洲、贡布和屈银华三个同志共同背着摄影机和胶片，冒着刺骨的寒风，从拔海八千七百米出发，到八千八百三十米的时候，他们带的人造氧气也用完了。等他们完成了人类历史上最艰难的路程，攀到海拔八千八百八十二米的珠穆朗玛峰的时候，已是25日的清晨四时二十分。在这样的高度上，他们每走一步，要付出多么巨大的劳动啊！在这里走一步要等于我们在平地上走一里地的时间。虽然他们在最后一个段落的艰难的路程中，是凭着雪的反光和星光，匍匐在岩石上一寸一寸地爬上顶峰的，但是我们的机器和胶片都一直伴随着英雄们！英雄们因为在夜里没有拍下登上主峰的镜头感到极大的遗憾。在顶上又不能久停，他们只好在极度疲劳的情况下，又把我们的摄影机和胶片从顶峰上背下来。这时天气又突然变坏了，雪开始不停地下着，当他们回到海拔八千七百米的时候，天已经亮了。为了拍下主峰，屈银华同志拿起摄影机准备拍摄两个镜头，但因过度疲劳，使他站立不稳，双手颤抖，他只好坐在山坡上依靠着背包拍了一个复着白雪的顶峰，和俯拍了一个喜马拉雅山云海镜头。
    这两个用生命换来的珍贵镜头，将永远刻印在人们的脑海里，将永远载入史册，放射出灿烂夺目的光芒！（附图片）
