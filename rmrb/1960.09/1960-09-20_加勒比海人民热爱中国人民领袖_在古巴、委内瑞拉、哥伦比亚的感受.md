The broad masses of people in the Caribbean, during our visit to Cuba, Venezuela, and Colombia to perform, used their heartfelt love for the great leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao Zedong, in words and actions to respond to the consistent support of the Chinese people for their national democratic movements. This not only deeply moved us but also made us profoundly realize that a leader of the people is bound to be loved by the people. Any artificial obstruction, the distance of thousands of miles, differences in language and customs, etc., only serve to intensify this feeling of admiration. When many progressive friends gave us a thumbs-up and said in a very sincere and admiring tone, "You are so fortunate to have the great Mao Zedong!" it immediately made one think about what kind of actions one should take to love the great leader of the motherland in order to be worthy of being a proud Chinese.

The people of the Caribbean, like the people of all of Latin America, especially the people of Cuba, expressed sincere feelings of love for the leader of the Chinese people in all aspects. During the nearly four months that the Chinese Art Troupe visited and performed in Venezuela, Colombia, and Cuba, they directly met with more than 200,000 spectators. Their love for Chinese art was closely linked with their love and admiration for the leader of the Chinese people. Whenever an excellent program appeared, people couldn't help but cheer "Mao Zedong," "China," "Long live Mao Zedong," and "Long live China." When Chinese artists appeared on the streets or among the masses, these exciting slogans also left a deep impression. Even when we first arrived in Caracas and had not yet performed, when people discovered that a group of Chinese who were paying tribute to their national hero Bolívar were cultural envoys from Beijing, someone in the crowd immediately shouted "Long live Mao Zedong," and "Long live China." Kind friends suggested that the Colombians were not as enthusiastic and unrestrained as the Caribbean people like those in Venezuela. However, the enthusiasm of the masses at the three performances in the Bogota Exhibition Hall was no less than elsewhere. When they shouted slogans, they stood up, waving their hats and scarves. It seemed that they couldn't express their full enthusiasm for loving the leader of the Chinese people and the art of the Chinese people without doing so. The scene was very moving, and some people even shed tears. In Cuba, we visited many cities and villages and had extensive contact with the rebel soldiers in the revolutionary base areas in the mountains, members of cooperatives in the countryside, workers in sugar factories... The simple and vivid slogans they used contained enormous power. They kept shouting "Cuba yes, Yankees no," and "China yes, Yankees no," which made American imperialism tremble! This clearly shows that our people and the people of Cuba and the entire Latin America share a common enemy: American imperialism. The banner of resolutely opposing American imperialism is very clear and powerful. It is precisely because of shared destiny and common interests that the Cuban people and the people of Venezuela, Colombia, and other countries love the leader of the Chinese people, which is by no means accidental.

The people of the Caribbean are also very familiar with other outstanding leaders of our people, such as Liu Shaoqi, Zhou Enlai, and Zhu De, and they admire them all. In Venezuela, many people are very familiar with the name of Marshal Lin Biao. They made a very meaningful connection and annotation to the Spanish word "Limpio" because its pronunciation is the same as Lin Biao. "Limpio" originally means clean, and they believe that Lin Biao is not only a famous general in China's resistance against Japanese imperialism but also that his fame has spread far and wide in the war to liberate all of China by driving out the American imperialist invading forces and the traitorous Chiang Kai-shek clique they supported. Therefore, in the eyes of the Venezuelan people, Lin Biao is on the one hand a symbol of completely eliminating imperialism, and on the other hand, it expresses a kind of respect for Marshal Lin Biao.

The love of the Caribbean people for the leader of the Chinese people is also prominently manifested in their love for his works. In particular, "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" and other important single-edition translations of essays are bestsellers in Cuba and other countries. These countries only have a two-volume Spanish version of "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" translated and published by a bookstore in Argentina last year, which is currently being sold throughout Latin America, and many bookstores feel that the supply cannot meet the demand. More than a thousand copies were quickly sold in Caracas, and people said that Venezuela has only more than six million people, and the literacy rate is relatively low, so it is rare for "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" to reach this sales figure. People all over Cuba are vying to buy the works of Chairman Mao Zedong and other Chinese leaders. Some books are in short supply, and many people repeatedly ask the Xinhua News Agency reporter stationed in Havana for them. Intellectuals are proud to have a copy of Mao Zedong's poems at home. The Cuban people's need for the works of the leader of the Chinese people is urgent and priceless. "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" sold for as much as fifteen pesos (equal to fifteen U.S. dollars) per copy in Havana, and sales were still very good. With the continued deepening of the Cuban revolution, the need for such works is becoming more widespread. During the war against Batista, the Cuban rebels had already circulated mimeographed copies of Chairman Mao's "Strategic Problems of Guerrilla War Against Japan" and called it "food from China." An air force captain praised Chairman Mao's military works as "good medicine from China." Chairman Mao's works on agricultural cooperativization and "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art," and other important works, are urgently needed by the Cuban revolutionary government and people. As for Chairman Liu Shaoqi's "How to Be a Good Communist," it has long been popular in the Cuban revolutionary ranks. Single-edition translations of Premier Zhou Enlai's "Report on the Question of Intellectuals" and Comrade Hu Qiaomu's "Thirty Years of the Communist Party of China" have been sold out in the market.

Chairman Mao's brilliant thesis that "Imperialism and all reactionaries are paper tigers" has had a great impact on the Caribbean people, especially in Cuba, and has become a household truth among the working people. Raúl Castro, Minister of Revolutionary Armed Forces of the Cuban government, told the person in charge of the Chinese Art Troupe that he completely agreed with Chairman Mao's analysis, saying: "Mao Zedong's analysis of imperialism is very correct because imperialism is indeed a paper tiger." He quoted Chairman Mao's words, saying that Taiwan is a noose that American imperialism has put around its neck, and the other end is held in the hands of the Chinese people. Just like the United States' policy toward Cuba, the other end of this noose is held in the hands of the Cuban people. In addition, there is a very vivid saying circulating in Cuba that the body of this paper tiger of the United States has been wet by the Cuban people's counterattack, and will soon be completely smashed to pieces.

Chairman Mao's creative development of Marxist-Leninist revolutionary theory has been tested by all the practices of the Chinese revolution. The Chinese people's revolution and the national democratic movements of the Latin American people have common ground. Especially based on the past and current situation in Cuba, if the revolution is to be advanced or the victory of the revolution is to be consolidated, the decisive role played by revolutionary theory is known to the Cuban people. Therefore, in addition to learning from the successful experiences of the Soviet Union and other countries' revolutions, they are extremely interested in the experience of the Chinese revolution. This has also educated us. As a Chinese in the Mao Zedong era, one should deeply understand the great significance of tirelessly studying Chairman Mao's works. (Attached picture)

### 加勒比海人民热爱中国人民领袖——在古巴、委内瑞拉、哥伦比亚的感受

    加勒比海人民热爱中国人民领袖
    ——在古巴、委内瑞拉、哥伦比亚的感受	徐淡庐
    我们在加勒比海的古巴、委内瑞拉和哥伦比亚三个国家访问演出过程中，热情纯朴的加勒比海广大人民，用他们发自衷心的热爱中国人民的伟大领袖——毛泽东主席的言语和行动来回答了中国人民对他们的民族民主运动的一贯支持。这不但极大地感动了我们，而且使我们深刻地体会到：是人民的领袖，人民就必然会热爱他，任何人为的阻碍，千山万水的距离，语言风俗的各不相同，等等，反倒是促成这种倾羡仰慕心理的强烈增长。当许多进步朋友竖起大拇指以十分诚挚钦佩的口吻对我们说，“你们真幸福，有伟大的毛泽东！”使人立刻想到应该用什么样的行动来热爱祖国的伟大领袖，才不愧为一个值得自豪的中国人。
    加勒比海的人民和整个拉丁美洲人民一样，特别是古巴人民，他们在各方面表现了热爱中国人民领袖的真诚感情。中国艺术团在委内瑞拉、哥伦比亚和古巴先后访问演出了将近四个月，同二十万以上的观众直接见了面，他们对中国艺术的喜爱同爱戴中国人民领袖的感情紧密地结合起来了，每当精采节目出现时，人们情不自禁地要欢呼“毛泽东”，“中国”，“毛泽东万岁”，“中国万岁”。当中国艺术家出现在街头或群众之中时，这种激动人心的口号同样给人留下深刻的印象。甚至我们刚到加拉加斯还未演出，人们发现向他们的民族英雄玻利瓦尔献花致敬的一群中国人是来自北京的文化使者时，人丛中立即就有人呼喊“毛泽东万岁”，“中国万岁”。好心的朋友提示我们，说是哥伦比亚人比不上像委内瑞拉这样的加勒比海人民的热情奔放。可是我们在波哥大展览大厅的三场演出，群众的狂热决不比别的地方稍有逊色，他们叫口号时是立着叫，挥动着帽子和头巾叫，不这样，似乎无法表达出他们热爱中国人民领袖和中国人民的艺术的满腔热忱，场面令人非常感动，有的人还流了眼泪。在古巴，我们到过许多城市和乡村，同山区革命根据地的起义军战士、农村中的合作社社员、糖厂的工人……，进行了极为广泛的接触，他们用的简明、生动的口号蕴蓄着巨大的力量，他们不停地高呼“要古巴，不要美国佬”，“要中国，不要美国佬”，使美帝国主义闻之也要丧胆！这点很清楚地说明：我国人民同古巴以及整个拉丁美洲人民的共同敌人是美帝国主义，坚决反对美帝国主义的旗帜是十分鲜明、有力的，正是命运相同，休戚与共，所以古巴人民和委内瑞拉、哥伦比亚等国人民热爱中国人民领袖决不是偶然的。
    加勒比海人民对我国人民其他杰出领袖如刘少奇、周恩来、朱德等都很熟悉，一提到都佩服不已。在委内瑞拉，不少人对林彪元帅的名字非常熟悉，他们将西班牙文“Limpio”一字因发音与林彪相同而作了很有意义的联系和注解。“Limpio”本系清洁的意思，而他们认为林彪不但是中国抵抗日本帝国主义的名将，在赶走美帝国主义侵略势力及其支持的蒋介石卖国集团的解放全中国的战争中，英名同样远播重洋。因此，林彪二字在委内瑞拉人民看来，一方面是象征将帝国主义彻底清除干净的意思；另一方面也表示对林彪元帅的一种崇敬。
    加勒比海人民热爱中国人民领袖还突出地表现在热爱他们的著作这一事实上面。特别是《毛泽东选集》和其它一些重要论文单行译本，更是古巴等国家的畅销书籍。这些国家只有一种去年由阿根廷一家书店翻译出版的西班牙文两卷本《毛泽东选集》，目前正在全拉丁美洲发售，很多书店都感到供不应求。在加拉加斯很快就销售一千多部，人们都说，委内瑞拉只有六百多万人口，文盲又比较多，《毛泽东选集》达到这个销售数字是很难得的。古巴全国各地都争相购买毛泽东主席和其他中国领袖的著作，有的书籍供应不上，很多人向我国驻哈瓦那的新华社记者再三索要，知识界人士以家里有一本毛泽东诗词为荣。古巴人民对中国人民领袖著作的需要是急切的，不计价值的。《毛泽东选集》在哈瓦那最高卖到每部十五个比索（等于十五个美元），仍然销路很好。随古巴革命的继续深入发展，需要这种著作的人更为普遍。古巴起义军在反对巴蒂斯塔战争中即已传阅着毛主席的《抗日游击战争的战略问题》的油印本，并称为是“来自中国的粮食”。有一位空军上尉称颂毛主席的军事著作是“来自中国的良药”。毛主席关于农业合作化问题的著作和《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》等等重要著作，都是古巴革命政府和人民非常殷切需要的。至于刘少奇主席的《论共产党员的修养》，也早在古巴革命队伍中流行。周恩来总理《关于知识分子问题的报告》的单行译本和胡乔木同志的《中国共产党的三十年》等书籍，在市场上已被抢购一空。
    毛主席关于“帝国主义和一切反动派都是纸老虎”的英明论断，给予加勒比海人民的影响极大，特别在古巴，已成为劳动人民家喻户晓的真理。古巴政府革命武装部部长劳尔·卡斯特罗对中国艺术团负责人表示完全同意毛主席的分析，他说：“毛泽东关于帝国主义的分析是非常正确的，因为帝国主义确实是一只纸老虎。”并引毛主席的话说，台湾是美帝国主义套在自己脖子上的绞索，它的另一端握在中国人民手里，正像美国对古巴的政策一样，这条绞索的另一端握在古巴人民手里。除此而外，古巴还流行一种非常形象化的说法，说今天美国这只纸老虎经过古巴人民的反击，纸扎的身子已被水打湿了，不久将要全部被打得稀巴烂。
    毛主席关于马克思列宁主义的革命理论的创造性的发展，已被中国革命的一切实践所检验；而中国人民的革命和拉丁美洲人民的民族民主运动存在着共同之处，特别是根据古巴的过去和目前的情况，如果要将革命推向前进或将革命的胜利巩固起来，革命理论所起的决定性作用，古巴人民是知道的。因此，他们除了学习苏联和其它国家革命的成功经验而外，对中国革命的经验感到极大兴趣。这一点同样也教育了我们，作为一个毛泽东时代的中国人，应该深切地懂得不倦地学习毛主席著作的重大意义。（附图片）
