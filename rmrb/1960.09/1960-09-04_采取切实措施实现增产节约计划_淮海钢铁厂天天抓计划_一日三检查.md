Implement Practical Measures to Achieve Production Increase and Conservation Plans
    Huaihai Steel Plant Grasps Plans Daily, Conducts Three Inspections a Day

    (Our report) The Huaihai Steel Plant Party Committee in Xuzhou, Jiangsu Province, after fully mobilizing the masses to formulate production increase and conservation plans, has been focusing on daily plans, grasping them three times a day, and conducting inspections shift by shift, analyzing furnace by furnace, to ensure the completion of the production increase and conservation plans. Since late August, production has significantly improved, with output increasing by 34.1% compared to mid-August, the utilization coefficient increasing by 20.5%, coke ratio decreasing by 14.37%, and the qualification rate reaching 96.22%, presenting a new situation of comprehensive and sustained leap forward.

    In mid-August, after summarizing the production achievements of the past seven months and formulating production increase and conservation plans for the next four months, the plant's workers established a system of "three grasps a day" to ensure the implementation of the plan. The first grasp is focusing on the first furnace production of the first shift, starting at midnight. Because the production of the first shift has an important impact on the production of the second and third shifts, and the production of the first furnace of the first shift is a key factor in the production of the first shift. Therefore, the plant Party committee believes that in order to ensure the completion of the daily plan by guaranteeing each shift, it is necessary to act vigorously to focus on the first shift and treat the night shift as the day shift. The entire plant, from top to bottom, has established a system of focusing on the first shift. Plant leaders, led by the Party Secretary and the Plant Director, take turns on duty to focus on the first shift. Each blast furnace also has responsible cadres assigned to specific areas, implementing the "four togethers" to focus on the first shift. The office cadres of the production scheduling, equipment maintenance, raw material supply, labor protection, and propaganda departments also work alongside the shifts, making the night shift production as lively and down-to-earth as the day shift. Zhao Qilin, the Party Secretary of the plant, went to Furnace No. 5 to focus on the production of the first shift, helping the workers of this blast furnace to specifically analyze the main reasons why the night shift production was lower than the day shift production in the previous period: the workers' energy at midnight was not concentrated enough, they were prone to loading the wrong materials, the handover system was not strict enough, and the raw material selection was not as good as the day shift. Therefore, phenomena such as cold furnace and burning through the iron notch were relatively common, and these phenomena mostly occurred in the first one or two furnaces of iron. In response to this situation, they immediately adopted the following measures: strengthening the handover system, changing the handover system for the heads of each type of work, such as furnace workers, hoisting workers, blower workers, and material transportation workers, to a mass collective handover system, and establishing a three-level inspection system of individual, group leader, and duty leader before the first furnace of iron was tapped. At the same time, in the work of furnace-by-furnace analysis, they also focused on the production of the first furnace of the first shift, effectively preventing accidents such as incorrect loading and blasting. They also resolutely implemented the principle of combining work and rest, ensuring that workers have eight hours of sleep and four hours of cultural and recreational activities every day, so that workers are energetic and focused when they come to work. After these measures were implemented, the production of the first shift increased by an average of 7% compared to the past, completely breaking the routine that the production of the first shift was lower than the day shift. After this experience was promoted throughout the plant, the production of the first shift of each furnace in the plant generally improved, achieving night shift production on par with the day shift. Because the production of the first shift was normal, it created favorable conditions for the subsequent two shifts to continue high production, and also strongly guaranteed the balanced completion of the daily plan. The second is to focus on active balance and strengthen scheduling. Plant leaders transferred capable cadres to enrich the dispatching office; leading cadres were also assigned responsibilities and implemented three dispatches per shift, checking the completion of the plan shift by shift, and immediately carrying out active balancing upon discovering weak links in production. For example, at the dispatching meeting on August 20, it was discovered that the supply of coke could not meet the demand. The plant Party committee immediately convened an enlarged meeting and adopted four measures, including shortening the coke production and transportation cycle, vigorously carrying out rapid coking, clearing accumulated coke, and greatly reducing the coke ratio, so that the coke supply kept up with the needs of production.

    The third is to evaluate daily. Through evaluation, the labor competition of "learning from, catching up with, surpassing, and helping" was powerfully promoted, and the opponent competitions between the blast furnaces, shifts and groups throughout the plant were in full swing, with everyone chasing each other and striving to be the best. For example, through daily evaluation, the plant Party committee specifically helped Furnace No. 5 to summarize the experience of sustained high production, convened an on-site meeting, and promoted it. After Furnace No. 2 learned this experience, the production level rose sharply from 34.28 tons on the 27th to 51 tons on the 29th.

    In implementing the work of "three grasps a day," the plant also implemented the spirit of comprehensively grasping ideology, production, and life. For example, it strengthened the ideological education of the masses, helped workers, especially those working on the night shift, properly arrange their work, study, and rest time, and educated the canteen and medical staff to establish the idea of serving the blast furnace, delivering food and water to the furnace, and medicine to the furnace, so that the workers could eat hot dishes and meals, which further boosted the enthusiasm of the masses.

    采取切实措施实现增产节约计划
    淮海钢铁厂天天抓计划　一日三检查
    本报讯　江苏省徐州淮海钢铁厂党委在充分发动群众订立增产节约计划之后，狠抓日计划，一天三抓；班班检查，炉炉分析，以确保增产节约计划的完成。8月下旬以来生产有了显著提高，产量比中旬提高34.1％，利用系数比中旬提高20.5％，焦比降低14.37％，合格率达到96.22％，出现了全面持续跃进的新局面。
    8月中旬，这个厂的职工在总结过去七个多月的生产成就和制订了今后四个多月的增产节约计划后，为了切实保证计划的实现，厂党委建立了一天三抓的制度。第一抓就是在半夜零时起抓头一班第一炉生产。因为第一班的生产对第二、第三两班的生产有着重要的影响，而头班第一炉的生产又是第一班生产的重要关键。因此厂党委认为，要做到以班保日、确保日计划的完成，必须雷厉风行狠抓头一班，把夜班当作日班抓。全厂从上到下建立了狠抓头一班的制度、厂领导上由党委书记和厂长挂帅，轮流值班抓头一班，每座高炉也都有负责干部分工包干，实行“四同”，狠抓头一班。生产调度，设备维护，原料供应，劳动保护和宣传鼓动等部门的科室干部也都实行跟班劳动，把夜班的生产搞得和日班一样既轰轰烈烈又踏踏实实。厂党委书记赵启林到五号炉抓头一班生产，帮助这个高炉的职工具体分析了前一时期夜班生产低于日班生产的主要原因是：职工们在半夜的精力不够集中，容易上错料，交接班制度也不够严格，原料精选不如日班，因此，炉凉，烧穿铁口等现象比较多，而这些现象又多数发生在头一、二炉铁上。针对这个情况，他们立即采取了这样一些措施：加强交接班制度，把炉前工、卷扬工、鼓风机工、运料工等各个工种的负责人交接班制度，改为群众性的集体交接班制度，在第一炉出铁前建立了个人、组长和值班长层层检查的三检查制度。同时，在炉炉分析的工作中，又着重抓住头班第一炉的生产，切实防止了装错料和打炮等事故。他们还坚决贯彻了劳逸结合的原则，保证工人每天有八小时的睡眠和四小时的文化娱乐活动，使职工上班以后，精力充沛，思想集中。这些措施执行以后，头一班的生产比过去平均提高了7％，完全打破了第一班生产低于日班的常规。全厂推广这个经验以后，使全厂各炉头一班的生产普遍有了提高，做到了夜班生产与日班并驾齐驱。由于第一班生产正常，为后两班生产创造了持续高产的有利条件，也有力地保证了日计划的均衡完成。第二是狠抓积极平衡，加强调度工作。厂领导抽调得力干部，充实了调度室；领导干部又分工负责，实行一班三次调度，班班检查计划完成情况，发现生产薄弱环节，立即进行积极平衡。如在8月20日调度会议上，发现焦炭供不应求，厂党委立即召开扩大会议，采取了缩短焦炭生产和运输周期，大搞快速炼焦、清理积压焦炭、大力降低焦比等四项措施，使焦炭供应跟上了生产的需要。
    第三是天天抓评比。通过评比，有力地推动了“学、赶、超、帮”的劳动竞赛，全厂各座高炉、各个班和小组之间的对手赛搞得热火朝天，你追我赶，力争上游。如通过日评比，厂党委具体帮助五号炉总结出持续高产的经验，召开现场会议，进行推广。二号炉学习了这项经验后，生产水平从27日的三十四点二八吨，逐日猛升到29日的五十一吨。
    这个厂在贯彻一天三抓的工作中，同时贯彻了全面抓思想、抓生产、抓生活的精神。如加强了对群众的思想教育工作，帮助工人，首先是夜班工作的工人，妥善安排好工作、学习和休息时间，并教育食堂和医务人员树立为高炉服务的思想，做到送饭送水到炉前，医药到炉前，使工人顿顿吃到热菜热饭，更加鼓舞了群众的积极性。
