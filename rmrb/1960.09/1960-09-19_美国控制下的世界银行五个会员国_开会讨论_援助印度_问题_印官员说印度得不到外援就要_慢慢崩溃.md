Xinhua News Agency, Paris, September 16th: The World Bank's five member states, controlled by the United States, held a so-called "Aid to India" meeting in Paris to discuss providing the financial "aid" needed for India's Third Five-Year Plan (April 1961 - March 1966). The meeting lasted three days, from the 12th to the 14th, but no conclusions were announced.

The meeting also studied the amount of "aid" needed for India's current fiscal year (the last year of the Second Five-Year Plan).

In addition to the United States, the participating countries included the United Kingdom, West Germany, Japan, and Canada. France did not participate in the meeting.

Indian officials originally had high hopes for the meeting. Indian Finance Minister Desai said during a debate on the draft of the Third Five-Year Plan in the Indian People's Assembly on August 25th that if India did not receive the foreign aid it needed, the plan would have to be revised.

After the World Bank's five-nation meeting, B.K. Nehru, India's Commissioner-General for Economic Affairs, spoke at a press conference in Paris on the 15th about the urgency of India's need for foreign aid. He said that India needed a total of $21 billion to implement the Third Five-Year Plan. Of this, $5 billion had to come from foreign aid.

He said, "If we don't get foreign capital, the plan will collapse." He added that failure to achieve the goals of the Third Five-Year Plan would mean India's "slow collapse."

He said that if India could not obtain assistance from the World Bank member states, it would have to turn to other countries, including the Soviet Union.

    美国控制下的世界银行五个会员国
    开会讨论“援助印度”问题
    印官员说印度得不到外援就要“慢慢崩溃”
    据新华社16日讯巴黎消息：由美国控制的世界银行五个会员国在巴黎召开一次所谓“援助印度”会议，讨论为印度第三个五年计划（1961年4月—1966年3月）提供所需的财政“援助”问题。会议从12日到14日开了三天，但是没有宣布任何结论。
    这次会议还研究了印度目前财政年度（第二个五年计划的最后一年）所需的“援助”的数字。
    参加这次会议的除美国外，还有英国、西德、日本和加拿大。法国没有参加这次会议。
    印度官员们原来对这次会议的期望很高。印度财政部长德赛8月25日在印度人民院辩论第三个五年计划草案时曾说，如果印度得不到它所需要的外援，这个计划就得重新修改。
    世界银行五国会议结束后，印度经济事务总专员布·克·尼赫鲁15日在巴黎举行的一次记者招待会上说到印度需要外援的迫切性。他说，印度一共需要二百一十亿美元来执行第三个五年计划。其中有五十亿美元要靠外援。
    他说，“如果我们得不到外国的资本，计划就要垮台。”他又说，如果不能实现第三个五年计划的目标，将意味着印度“慢慢地崩溃”。
    他说，如果不能从世界银行的会员国获得援助，印度将不得不求助于包括苏联在内的其他国家。
