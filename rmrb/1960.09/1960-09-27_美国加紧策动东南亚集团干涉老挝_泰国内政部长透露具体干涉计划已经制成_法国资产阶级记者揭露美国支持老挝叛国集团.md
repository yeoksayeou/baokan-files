Xinhua News Agency, 26th, Bangkok Dispatch: Under the active plotting of U.S. imperialism, the Southeast Asia aggressive bloc is stepping up its deployment to interfere in Laos' internal affairs.

According to Thai newspapers, the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization held a meeting of council representatives on the 23rd, following one on the 20th, to "discuss" the situation in Laos. Sources revealed that the main purpose of this meeting was to "study" the recent statement by Thai Prime Minister Sarit Thanarat, who frantically clamored for intervention in Laos' internal affairs.

Thai Interior Minister Nai Praphat disclosed to the press on the 23rd that the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization had completed a "concrete plan" for intervening in Laos at its two recent secret meetings.

Sources also revealed that one member state of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization had suggested that the aggressive bloc establish an armed force like the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. It is expected that the aggressive bloc will urgently study the issue of establishing such an armed force.

According to newspaper reports, U.S. Ambassador to Thailand, Johnson, held a secret meeting with Sarit Thanarat on the 23rd. Prior to this, on the 20th, Johnson had publicly stated that he strongly agreed with Thailand's attitude of "concern" and "worry" regarding the situation in Laos.

Under the instigation of the United States, the Sarit Thanarat reactionary clique of Thailand, the vanguard of the Southeast Asia aggressive bloc in interfering in Laos, continues to clamor for armed intervention in Laos. According to reports, Thai Army Chief of Staff, General Chit Chatnakrob, once again spoke to the press on the 23rd, clamoring that the Thai army was "prepared." The situation in Vientiane is worthy of concern for the "happiness" and "security" of Thailand. If Thailand is "invaded," Thai troops "can carry out missions in any area at any time." Chit Chatnakrob also said, "We already have a complete plan, and once a war occurs, we can effectively and rapidly execute the mission."

According to the "Thai People's Newspaper," quoting relevant sources, Sarit Thanarat, at a high-level military general meeting held on the 23rd specifically to discuss the situation in Laos, had requested the Thai armed forces to conduct "preparations" in accordance with the government's policy.

Xinhua News Agency, Paris, 25th: The well-known French bourgeois journalist, Madame Tabouis, published an article in "Aujourd'hui Paris," exposing the U.S. conspiracy to interfere in Laos.

The article, entitled "The Mystery of Laos is Revealed," said: "Thanks to information provided by diplomatic officials and military advisors, the mystery of Laos has become clear. It seems that the activities of some American advisors are mainly responsible for the current chaotic situation."

The article emphasized that the Pentagon hopes to launch foreign intervention. Because U.S. military personnel believe that the intervention of the troops of Thailand and the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization in the situation in Laos would quickly achieve "victory," "so the U.S. military supported General Phoumi's counter-revolution and then supported Prince Boun Oum's converging riot."

    法国资产阶级记者揭露美国支持老挝叛国集团
    新华社26日讯　曼谷消息：在美帝国主义积极策动下，东南亚侵略集团正在加紧部署干涉老挝内政。
    据泰国报纸报道，东南亚条约组织继20日之后又在23日召开理事代表会议，“讨论”有关老挝局势问题。消息透露，召开这次会议主要是为了“研究”泰国总理乃沙立最近发表的疯狂叫嚣干涉老挝内政的声明。
    泰国内政部长乃巴博在23日向报界发表谈话时透露，东南亚条约组织在最近召开的两次秘密会议上，已经完成了干涉老挝的“具体计划”。
    消息还透露，东南亚条约组织的一个成员国已经建议这个侵略集团像北大西洋公约组织一样成立一支武装部队。预料这个侵略集团将会紧急地研究有关成立这种武装部队的问题。
    另据报纸报道，美国驻泰国大使约翰逊在23日曾经和乃沙立举行秘密会谈。在这以前，约翰逊在20日曾公开表示，他非常同意泰国对老挝局势所表现的“关切”和“忧虑”的态度。
    在美国唆使下，东南亚侵略集团中干涉老挝的急先锋泰国乃沙立反动集团，正继续叫嚣武装干涉老挝。据报道，泰国陆军参谋长乃集滴23日再次向报界发表谈话叫嚣说，泰国陆军已经作好了“戒备”。万象局势对于泰国的“幸福”和“安全”是值得忧虑的。如果泰国受到“侵略”，泰国军队“可以随时在任何地区执行任务”。乃集滴还说，“我们已经有完整的计划，一旦战事发生，即可以有效力和迅速地执行任务”。
    据“泰人报”援引有关方面透露消息，乃沙立在23日召开的一次专门讨论老挝局势的高级军事将领会议上，已经要求泰国武装部队遵照政府的方针，进行“戒备”。
    新华社巴黎25日电　法国著名资产阶级记者塔布依夫人在“今日巴黎报”上发表文章，揭露美国干涉老挝的阴谋。
    题为“老挝的谜揭开了”的这篇文章说：“由于外交官员和军事顾问提供的情况，老挝的谜明朗化了。看来主要是一些美国顾问的活动应对目前的混乱局势负责。”
    文章着重指出，五角大楼希望发动外国干涉。因为美国军人认为，泰国和东南亚条约组织的军队对老挝局势进行的干涉会迅速地取得“胜利”，“所以美国军人支持富米将军的反革命，然后又支持文翁亲王的殊途同归的暴动”。
