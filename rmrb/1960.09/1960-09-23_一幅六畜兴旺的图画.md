A Picture of Thriving Livestock
Xia Fang text, Miao Di drawing

In August, the rural areas of Jiaohe County, Jilin Province, are filled with autumn harvest scenes. The summer hoeing has just come to an end, and the season for herding cattle and watering horses has begun again. On the morning of August 10th, members of the Happiness Road People's Commune happily led their cattle and horses to Xin Zhan, the central market town of the commune, to participate in the commune's livestock evaluation conference.

More than five hundred strong horses and cattle filled the lush green lawn: majestic stallions, robust bulls, and docile cows peacefully grazing, while foals and calves frolicked everywhere... More than a hundred red flag bearers from the plains, mountains, and forest areas enthusiastically patted and stroked their beloved horses and honest cattle, constantly introducing the Jiaohe horses, Soviet horses, Mongolian horses, Binzhou cattle, Mongolian cattle, Korean cattle, and improved Dutch Holstein cattle, as well as mules and donkeys from within the customs, to the bustling audience. A beautiful picture of thriving livestock in the People's Commune was displayed before everyone's eyes.

Han En, an old hero of the agricultural front and the head of the Happiness Road People's Commune, was all smiles today. He walked around the venue, chatting with the breeders about the development of livestock and carefully examining the condition of the horses and cattle with the evaluation committee members. Thirteen years ago, Han En's mutual aid team, which started with a single healthy horse, has now developed into a People's Commune with more than 13,000 people, over 5,800 hectares of land, and more than 3,400 head of large livestock. This is a cold, semi-mountainous area, and the main power for cultivation and transportation is large livestock. People attach great importance to livestock breeding and reproduction. Outstanding figures on the livestock front continue to emerge. Among the 200-plus breeders in the commune, one-third have become pacesetters and advanced producers. A few days ago, when they heard that the commune was going to hold a livestock evaluation conference, the whole commune was stirred up. They added feed and water, brushed the horses, and washed the cattle to welcome the grand event. Today, the general branch secretaries, directors, production team leaders, and many commune members from various management districts have come to visit. Like the old hero Han En, they appreciate the herds of cattle and horses of the socialist collective and look forward to greater livestock development and greater agricultural harvests.

The crowd was noisy, the horses neighed, and the cattle mooed. The livestock evaluation conference was in full swing. In the northern part of the square, a large group of livestock stood out for their plump bodies. Each cow had red and yellow signs hanging on its forehead, indicating the situation of pregnancy and mating. Yang Yongshan, a young inseminator, with sparkling eyes, introduced with a smile the experience of livestock breeding and reproduction in the birthplace of the Han En Mutual Aid Team. This Bao'an management district took the lead this spring in implementing advanced methods of separating males and females, separating strong and weak animals, separating pregnant animals, and combining management, feeding, and labor. All livestock are full of fat year-round and reproduce vigorously. He patted and stroked a big white horse, boasting: "This is our high-yield dam, pregnant every year for the past seven years, producing foals every year, all alive and all strong. The gray-white horses, chestnut-green horses, and yellow-fat horses around it are all its offspring. Today, three generations are on the same field to participate in the evaluation." Since this spring, this Communist Youth League member, who loves his career, has braved wind and rain to inseminate more than 300 pregnant cows, of which 69 out of 99 mares were pregnant with foals.

The old breeder Xu Fengshan and his herd were surrounded by a crowd. For ten years, this old pacesetter, who loved the commune like his home and livestock like his children, had delivered a hundred calves, all of which survived. On days of bitter cold and torrential rain, he took off his cotton coat more than once and draped it over the young animals. Today, he brought five pregnant cows and five calves born this spring. Grandpa Xu held the big mouth of a black cow in both hands and said, "This black cow used to have miscarriages every year, but this year it also gave birth to a calf!" The surrounding breeders asked him about his feeding experience.

The thirty large yellow cattle from the Master Ridge mountainous area stood towering in the center of the square. Each one weighed over a thousand pounds, was eight feet long, and four feet five inches tall, lined up in a row, like a herd of giant elephants. They were extremely powerful, able to endure hardship and heavy loads. Each time, each cow could pull more than a ton of wood and plow the land by themselves. Today, there are a total of 150 such large cattle in the venue. They are important helpers for people in mountainous and forest areas.

"One mare gives birth to twin foals" and "one mare nurses twin foals" have become popular stories in the whole venue. In two places not far away, a pair of identical little yellow horses were turning around next to an old yellow-and-white horse; two little horses, one red and one black, would walk towards the crowd for a while, and suddenly return to the side of the jujube-red horse. The old yellow horse had only given birth to one litter in the past. After collectivization, it was transferred to Chang Dezhi, a breeder from the Juxian Production Team in the Daji Management District. Because of careful feeding, it gave birth to these twin foals in May last year. Feng Guangxi, a breeder from the Dadong Team in the Bei'an Management District, pointed to the little black horse with a bit of a joking tone and said: "It was 'adopted' by the jujube-red horse. Look, it has been nursed to be as strong as the little red horse." The visitors were very interested in asking about their tricks for breeding and feeding, and discussed among themselves: in the past, it was considered a rare auspicious omen to see double ears of rice and twin foals; now, it has become a fruitful result of our great development in animal husbandry.

The story of the "Livestock Sanatorium" has also spread. When the evaluation committee members approached the six fat cows in the Dongshan Production Team of the Xinzhan Management District, before the breeder Fang Zongtang could speak, an enthusiastic audience member interjected: "These are the fat cattle from the Livestock Sanatorium. Any sick or weak cattle will be raised well and fattened as soon as they get into their hands." This production team has been rated as an advanced breeding unit for many years. Fang Zongtang is known for his carefulness in feeding livestock. He usually noticed that horses loved to eat the green grass in the paddies with reeds, and sick cattle were willing to eat sour corn buns, so he carefully adjusted their feed. As a result, the livestock ate better and better. The Donggou Production Team, in the Democratic Management District, was as famous as the Dongshan Production Team. Thirteen head of livestock, originally weak and powerless due to excessive labor, gained weight and strength under the patient care of the breeder Li Shilu. This spring, each animal plowed an average of ten hectares of land.

The livestock evaluation conference was like a livestock exhibition, and it was also an experience exchange meeting for breeders, and finally became an enthusiastic competition. When the red flag was awarded to the Bao'an Management District, Fan Yonglin, the general branch secretary of the Bei'an Management District, solemnly stepped onto the stage to challenge Bao'an: next year, he must let the red flag fly over the livestock sheds in Bei'an. The breeders in Bao'an pushed Yang Yongshan onto the stage to respond to the challenge: the red flag must take root in Bao'an. Applause thundered like thunder, and seven advanced units and fifty-eight pacesetters and advanced breeders were awarded. Their outstanding horses and cattle, in teams, passed the evaluation platform, each wearing a big red flower. (Attached image)

　　一幅六畜兴旺的图画
　　夏方文　苗地画
    8月，在吉林省蛟河县农村，一片秋收景色。夏锄刚刚告一段落，牧牛饮马的季节又开始了。8月10日的早晨，幸福之路人民公社的社员们，喜气洋洋地牵牛带马，涌到公社的中心集镇新站，参加公社的耕畜评比大会。
    五百多头骏马壮牛布满了绿草如茵的广场上：雄赳赳的种马，魁梧的公牛，母畜温驯地低头啃着青草，小驹小犊到处纵跃嘻戏……。来自平原、山地和林区的一百多名红色饲养员，吆喝着、抚摸着自己的娇马憨牛，不停地向熙熙攘攘的观众介绍场中的蛟河马、苏联马、蒙古马、滨洲牛、蒙古牛、朝鲜牛和改良的荷兰大花牛以及关内来的骡、驴的膘色与特性。一幅人民公社六畜兴旺的美画图展现在人们的眼前。
    农业战线的老英雄、幸福之路人民公社社长韩恩，今天满面笑容。他在全场各处走动，一面和饲养员唠叨牲畜发展的情况，一面和评比委员们仔细察看马牛的膘色。十三年前，靠一匹膘马起家的韩恩互助组，现在已发展成为拥有一万三千多人口、五千八百多公顷土地和三千四百多头大牲畜的人民公社。这里是高寒的半山区，耕作和运输的主要动力是大牲畜。人们十分重视牲畜的饲养和繁育。畜牧战线上的风流人物不断涌现，全社二百多名饲养员中，就有三分之一的人成为标兵和先进生产者。早几天一听说公社将举行耕畜评比大会，全社就轰动起来了，纷纷添料加水，刷马洗牛，迎接盛会。今天，各管理区的总支书记、主任、生产队长和许多社员，都到场参观。他们同老英雄韩恩的心情一样，欣赏着社会主义大集体的牛群马队，展望着牲畜更大发展和农业更大丰收的前景。
    人声喧哗，马嘶牛吽，耕畜评比大会正在热烈进行。在广场北部，一大群牲畜膘肥体壮，特别出众。头头母畜的额前分别挂着红黄两色彩牌，标明怀驹和配种的情况。青年配种员杨永山，闪动着一对发亮的眼睛，笑容可掬地介绍了韩恩互助组发祥地的牲畜饲养和繁殖的经验。这个保安管理区今春率先实行了公母分群、强弱分槽、孕畜分栏和管理、饲养、使役三结合的先进方法，全部牲畜常年膘满，繁殖旺盛。他连拍带摸地夸耀一匹大白马，说：“这是我们的高产母马，七年来年年怀驹，岁岁产仔，全产全活全壮。周围的灰白马、栗青马、黄膘马，都是它的后代。今天它们三代同场，齐来评比。”这位热爱自己事业的共青团员，今春以来，风里来雨里去，为三百多头能孕的母畜配种，其中九十九匹母马，就有六十九匹怀了驹。
    老饲养员徐凤山和他的牛群，正被人群团团围住。十年来，这位爱社如家、爱畜如子的老标兵，一共接生过百头牛犊，头头成活。在天寒地冻和狂风暴雨的日子里，他不止一次地脱下自己的棉袄，披在幼畜的身上。今天，他牵来了五头怀犊的母牛和它们春天生下的五头小牛。徐大爷双手捧着一头黑牛的大嘴，说道：“这头黑牛原来连年流产，今年也产犊了！”四周围的饲养员纷纷向他请教饲养的经验。
    老爷岭山区的三十头大黄牛，庞然站立在广场中央。头头重千斤、长八尺、高四尺五寸，一字儿排开，好似一群巨象。它们力大无穷，耐劳任重。每次每头牛能拉一吨多重的木材，能单独套犁翻地。今天全场共有一百五十头这样的大牛，它们是山区和林区人们的重要帮手。
      “一马产双驹”和“一马奶双驹”，成为全场的佳话。在不远的两处地方，一对一模一样的小黄马在一匹黄中带白的老马身旁转来转去；一红一黑的两匹小马，一会儿走向人群，忽然又回到枣红马的跟前。老黄马过去只产过一胎，公社化后拨到大吉管理区巨先生产队饲养员昌德志手里，由于饲养精心，去年5月间产下了这对孪生的小驹。北安管理区大东队的饲养员冯广锡带点开玩笑的口气指着小黑马说：“它是‘过继’给枣红马的，你看，被奶得和小红马同样壮实。”参观的人十分有兴趣地打听他们配种和饲养的妙诀，互相议论着：过去把禾结双穗、马产双驹看作难得的瑞祥之兆；现在，它却变成我们畜牧业大发展中的丰收果实了。
      “牲畜疗养院”的事情也传开了。评比委员们走近新站管理区东山生产队的六头肥硕的母牛的时候，饲养员房宗堂还没有来得及开口，热心的观众插上了嘴：“这就是牲畜疗养院里的肥牛。任何病弱的牛马一到他们的手里，就会养好养肥壮。”这个生产队连年被评为先进饲养单位。房宗堂喂牲畜出名的细心。平日观察到马爱吃甸子中带苇子的青草，病牛愿意吃发酸的包米饽饽，他就加意调喂。结果，牲畜越吃越好。民主管理区有一个东沟生产队，同东山生产队齐名。原来因使役过重瘦弱无力的十三头牲畜，在饲养员李世禄的耐心调理下，长膘增重，转弱为强。今春平均每头牲畜翻地十公顷。
    耕畜评比大会好比牲畜展览会，又是饲养员的经验交流会，最后成为热烈的竞赛大会。当红旗被评给保安管理区的时候，北安管理区总支书记范永林郑重地上台向保安挑战：明年一定要让红旗在北安的畜舍上飘扬。保安的饲养员推杨永山上台应战：红旗一定要在保安扎根。掌声像雷般震动，七个先进单位和五十八名标兵与先进饲养员受奖。他们的出色的马和牛，结队经过评比台，一一戴上了大红花。（附图片）
