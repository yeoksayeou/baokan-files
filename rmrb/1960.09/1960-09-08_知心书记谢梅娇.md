    Intimate Secretary Xie Meijiao
    Comrade Xie Meijiao is the First Secretary of the Xiaoxiao People's Commune Party Committee in Linchuan County, Jiangxi Province. Born into a poor peasant family, she lived as a child bride from the age of eleven. After liberation, she began working, maintaining the true qualities of the working people for ten years as if it were one day. She participated in production, led production, adhered to the Party's mass line working method, worked hard and deeply, and maintained close ties with the masses, earning the deep love of the masses. The commune members all call her "Intimate Secretary."
    In the past, Xiaoxiao Commune was a backward area in its work. Under the correct leadership of the Commune Party Committee headed by Comrade Xie Meijiao, it united all cadres and commune members, vigorously developed production, and achieved successive years of increased production and bumper harvests, becoming one of the most advanced communes in the county. This year, the commune's increase in early rice production exceeded any previous year. The work of summer harvesting, summer planting, and autumn field management is also leading the entire region.

    知心书记谢梅娇
    谢梅娇同志是江西省临川县孝桥人民公社党委第一书记。她出身于贫农家庭，十一岁就过起童养媳生活。解放后参加工作，她十年如一日地保持着劳动人民的本色，参加生产领导生产，坚持党的群众路线的工作方法，工作艰苦深入，密切联系群众，深得群众的爱戴。社员们都称她为知心书记。
    孝桥公社过去在工作上是个后进区，在以谢梅娇同志为首的公社党委的正确领导下，团结全体干部和社员，大力发展生产，连年增产丰收，成为全县最先进的公社之一。今年这个社的早稻增产幅度，超过以往任何一年。夏收、夏种和秋田管理的工作也在全专区领先。（附图片）
