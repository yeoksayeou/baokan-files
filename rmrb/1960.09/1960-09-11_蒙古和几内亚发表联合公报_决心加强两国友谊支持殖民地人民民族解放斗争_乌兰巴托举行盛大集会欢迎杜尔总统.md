Xinhua News Agency, Ulaanbaatar, September 10th: According to TASS, Ulaanbaatar, September 10th: The Government Delegation of the Republic of Guinea, headed by President Sékou Touré of the Republic of Guinea, which is on a state visit to the Mongolian People's Republic, signed the Mongolian-Guinean Joint Communiqué and a cultural cooperation agreement in Ulaanbaatar today after talks with the Government of the Mongolian People's Republic.

The Mongolian-Guinean Joint Communiqué stated that the two countries are determined to strengthen the friendship between the peoples of Guinea and Mongolia and to do their utmost to support the national liberation struggles of the peoples of colonial dependent countries.

The communiqué pointed out that during the talks, the two sides exchanged views on the further development of friendly relations between the Mongolian People's Republic and the Republic of Guinea, and on the current international situation of interest to both sides.

During the talks, the two sides held consistent views on the issues discussed. The Mongolian People's Republic and the Republic of Guinea believe that, under modern conditions, an extremely important condition for ensuring normal relations between countries with different social and political systems is to implement the principles of peaceful coexistence and to resolve all international disputes through peaceful negotiations. They believe that firmly implementing these principles is a necessary condition for ensuring lasting international peace and security.

The representatives of the two countries declared their full support for the Soviet government's proposal for complete and thorough disarmament, which is in line with the vital interests and aspirations of the peoples of all countries.

Xinhua News Agency, Ulaanbaatar, September 9th: The Presidium of the Great People's Hural and the Council of Ministers of Mongolia held a grand banquet tonight to welcome President Sékou Touré of the Republic of Guinea and all members of the Guinean government delegation he leads.

Mongolian Party and government leaders Sambuu, Tseden, and others attended the banquet. Diplomatic envoys from various countries to Mongolia were also invited to attend the banquet.

Chairman Sambuu and President Touré spoke at the banquet.

In his speech, Sambuu said that although our two countries are far apart, our people share the same desire for peaceful and friendly coexistence with the peoples of all countries. The Mongolian people praise and support the policy pursued by the government of the Republic of Guinea, which aims to safeguard and consolidate world peace. He said that new independent countries are constantly emerging in Africa, but colonialists do not want African countries to be free and independent. In order to continue to maintain their rule in these countries, they have adopted various conspiracies and even armed aggression.

Sambuu said that the Mongolian people highly appreciate the heroic struggle of the Guinean people in consolidating the unity of the African people and eliminating the abnormal situation in the Republic of the Congo in the struggle to liberate Africa from imperialist colonial rule, as well as President Touré's tireless efforts.

In his speech, Touré pointed out that although his stay in Mongolia was short, its significance was profound. Today's talks between the two sides will help consolidate the friendship and cooperation between the two peoples.

He said that the peoples of our two countries have similarly suffered from the rule and enslavement of colonialists, and have also waged long and heroic struggles to achieve liberation and independence from imperialist rule. The Asian people’s struggle for freedom and independence has inspired the African people’s liberation struggle. The liberation and national independence of the Asian people from imperialist rule has contributed to weakening the strength of imperialism. He emphasized that Africa has awakened today and is fighting for freedom and justice. The unity of the peoples of Asian and African countries is a huge force on the international stage. As a result of the heroic struggle of the African people, sixteen countries have declared their independence. They will participate in the upcoming 15th session of the United Nations General Assembly.

He said that the African people resolutely protest against the arbitrary obstruction by some people of the Mongolian People's Republic from joining the United Nations. He also said that it is intolerable that the most populous people in the world, China, has not yet participated in such an important international organization as the United Nations.

President Touré said that in order to achieve the complete victory of peace, we believe that it is not unconditional. The conditions are that all countries must be independent and that the conditions for mutual cooperation between the peoples of all countries under the premise of peace must be met. But imperialist countries will not accept these two conditions, so striving for peace means opposing imperialism. He said that a sacred task of the young, independent Republic of Guinea is to contribute to the cause of peace for the people of the world.

Xinhua News Agency, Ulaanbaatar, September 10th: The working people of Ulaanbaatar held a Mongolian-Guinean people's friendship rally at the Ulaanbaatar Gymnasium this morning to welcome President Sékou Touré of the Republic of Guinea and the Guinean government delegation he leads. Mongolian leaders Sambuu, Tseden, and others participated in the rally.

Acting Chairman Tseden of the Mongolian Council of Ministers and Guinean President Touré spoke at the rally. In his speech, Tseden said that the Guinean government delegation headed by President Touré met with the Mongolian working people during their visit to Mongolia, which contributed to enhancing the friendly relations between Mongolia and Guinea and safeguarding world peace.

He expressed his belief that colonialism will inevitably collapse and that the African people will surely achieve independence. He finally congratulated the Republic of Guinea on its independence and on its new achievements in the cause of developing the national economy and culture.

In his speech, Touré pointed out that the increasingly close exchanges between the peoples of Mongolia and Guinea are exciting.

Touré said that the independence of African countries is not only the result of the heroic struggle of the African people, but also the result of the struggle of Asian and African countries and the people of the world for national independence. At present, an important task facing the African people is to eliminate backwardness and regard the construction of their motherland and the improvement of the people's lives as their important tasks.

He pointed out that the cultural cooperation agreement signed between Mongolia and Guinea today has opened up broad avenues for the exchanges of cultural and artistic delegations between the two countries, which will help the two peoples to cooperate towards the bright prospects pointed out by the Bandung Conference.

Touré finally said that we will go to Beijing, the People's Republic of China, which is our and your common friend. May the fraternal friendship between our two countries be further consolidated, let us defeat the instigators of war with a common struggle, and achieve victory in the struggle for human rights and democracy.

Diplomatic envoys from various countries to Mongolia participated in the rally.

Xinhua News Agency, Ulaanbaatar, September 10th: President Sékou Touré of the Republic of Guinea and the Guinean government delegation he led concluded their visit to Mongolia and left here by plane for Beijing this morning. Sambuu, Chairman of the Presidium of the Great People's Hural of Mongolia, Tseden, Acting Chairman of the Council of Ministers, other leaders of the Mongolian Party and state, as well as Chinese and foreign diplomatic envoys to Mongolia saw them off at the airport.

Touré, accompanied by Sambuu and Tseden, reviewed the guard of honor.

In his farewell speech, Sambuu asked Touré to convey the Mongolian government's and people's best wishes to the Guinean government and people, and wished the Guinean people greater achievements in the cause of prospering the economy, building a new life, and safeguarding world peace.

In his farewell speech, Touré thanked the Mongolian government and people for their warm reception. He said that we will tell our people that the Mongolian people support the struggle of the African people. We will further develop the struggle. He said that during our visit, the Mongolian government and people expressed their wishes to the Guinean people, for which I express my gratitude once again.

    蒙古和几内亚发表联合公报
    决心加强两国友谊支持殖民地人民民族解放斗争  乌兰巴托举行盛大集会欢迎杜尔总统
    新华社10日讯　据塔斯社乌兰巴托10日讯：到蒙古人民共和国作国事访问的、以几内亚共和国总统塞古·杜尔为首的几内亚共和国政府代表团同蒙古人民共和国政府经过会谈后，今日在乌兰巴托签署了蒙古—几内亚联合公报和文化合作协定。
    蒙古—几内亚联合公报中谈到两国决心加强几内亚和蒙古两国人民之间的友谊、尽力支持殖民地附属国人民的民族解放斗争。
    公报中指出，在会谈过程中，双方就蒙古人民共和国和几内亚共和国友好关系的进一步发展和双方所感兴趣的现代国际局势问题交换了意见。
    在会谈过程中，双方对所讨论的问题，观点是一致的。蒙古人民共和国和几内亚共和国认为，在现代条件下，保证不同社会制度和政治制度的国家之间正常关系的一个极重要条件，是贯彻和平共处的原则和通过和平谈判解决一切国际争端问题。它们认为，坚决实现这些原则，是保证国际持久和平和安全的必要的条件。
    两国代表声明完全支持苏联政府的全面彻底裁军建议，这个建议符合各国人民的切身利益和愿望。
    据新华社乌兰巴托9日电　蒙古大人民呼拉尔主席团和部长会议今天晚上举行盛大宴会，欢迎几内亚共和国总统塞古·杜尔和他率领的几内亚政府代表团全体人员。
    蒙古党政领导人桑布、曾德等出席了宴会。应邀参加宴会的还有各国驻蒙古的外交使节。
    桑布主席和杜尔总统先后在会上讲了话。
    桑布在讲话中说，我们两国相隔很远，但是我国人民同各国人民和平友好相处的愿望是一致的。蒙古人民赞扬和支持几内亚共和国政府奉行的旨在维护和巩固世界和平的政策。他说，非洲不断地出现新的独立国家，但是，殖民主义者不希望非洲国家自由独立，为了在这些国家继续保留统治地位，采用了种种阴谋诡计，甚至武装侵略。
    桑布说，蒙古人民对于几内亚人民在从帝国主义殖民统治下解放非洲的斗争中巩固非洲人民的团结一致和消除在刚果共和国发生的不正常形势的事业中的英勇斗争，以及杜尔总统不倦的努力，给予很高的评价。
    杜尔在讲话中指出，他在蒙古的逗留时间虽短，但意义是深远的。今天双方举行的会谈有助于巩固两国人民的友谊和合作。
    他说，我们两国人民曾同样地遭受殖民主义者的统治和奴役，也同样为了争取从帝国主义的统治下获得解放、独立而进行了长期的英勇斗争。亚洲人民的争取自由、独立的斗争鼓舞了非洲人民的解放斗争。亚洲人民从帝国主义的统治下获得解放和民族独立，这对削弱帝国主义的力量作出了贡献。他强调说，今天非洲已经觉醒了，非洲正在为自由、正义而斗争。亚洲和非洲各国人民的团结是国际舞台上的一支巨大力量。由于非洲人民进行英勇斗争的结果，已经有十六个国家宣告独立了。它们将参加即将召开的联合国大会第十五届会议。
    他说，非洲人民坚决抗议某一部分人任意阻挠蒙古人民共和国加入联合国。他又说，世界上人口最多的人民中国还未参加到像联合国这样的重要国际组织，是令人难以容忍的。
    杜尔总统说，为了取得和平的彻底胜利，我们认为不是没有条件的。条件就是各国必须独立和满足各国人民在和平前提下相互合作的条件。但是帝国主义国家是不会接受这两个条件的，因此争取和平就是反对帝国主义。他说，年青独立的几内亚共和国的一个神圣任务就是，为世界人民的和平事业作出贡献。
    新华社乌兰巴托10日电　乌兰巴托市劳动人民今天上午在乌兰巴托体育馆举行蒙古—几内亚人民友好集会，欢迎几内亚共和国总统塞古·杜尔和他率领的几内亚政府代表团。蒙古领导人桑布、曾德等参加了这次集会。
    蒙古部长会议代理主席曾德和几内亚总统杜尔先后在会上讲了话。曾德在讲话中说，以杜尔总统为首的几内亚政府代表团在访问蒙古期间会见了蒙古劳动人民，对增进蒙古和几内亚两国的友好关系和维护世界和平作出了贡献。
    他表示相信，殖民主义必将崩溃，非洲人民一定能够得到独立。他最后祝贺几内亚共和国的独立和在发展民族经济、文化的事业中取得新的成就。
    杜尔在讲话中指出，蒙古和几内亚两国人民的来往日益密切，这是令人兴奋的。
    杜尔说，非洲国家得到独立不仅是非洲人民英勇斗争的结果，同时也是亚非各国和世界人民为争取民族独立而进行斗争的结果。目前，非洲人民面临的一个重要任务是消灭落后状态，把建设祖国、改善人民生活面貌当作自己的重要任务。
    他指出，今天蒙几两国签订的文化合作协定，为两国文化、艺术代表团的来往开辟了广阔的途径，有助于两国人民向着万隆会议指出的光辉远景进行合作。
    杜尔最后说，我们将要去我们和你们的共同朋友人民中国的北京。愿我们两国的兄弟友谊更加巩固，让我们以共同的斗争击败战争挑拨者，在争取人的权利和民主的斗争中取得胜利。
    各国驻蒙古的外交使节参加了这次集会。
    据新华社乌兰巴托10日电　几内亚共和国总统塞古·杜尔和他率领的几内亚政府代表团结束了在蒙古的访问，今天上午从这里乘飞机前往北京。蒙古大人民呼拉尔主席团主席桑布、代理部长会议主席曾德和蒙古党和国家其他领导人，以及中国和各国驻蒙古的外交使节到机场送行。
    杜尔由桑布和曾德陪同检阅了仪仗队。
    桑布在致欢送词时请杜尔转达蒙古政府和人民对几内亚政府和人民的美好祝愿，并祝几内亚人民在繁荣经济、建设新生活和维护世界和平的事业中取得更大的成就。
    杜尔在致告别词时感谢蒙古政府和人民的盛情接待。他说，我们将告诉我国人民，蒙古人民支持非洲人民的斗争。我们将进一步开展斗争。他说，在我们访问期间，蒙古政府和人民曾向几内亚人民表示祝愿，为此我再一次表示感谢。
