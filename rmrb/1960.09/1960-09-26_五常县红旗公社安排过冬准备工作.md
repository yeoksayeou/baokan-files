Xinhua News Agency Report: The Hongqi People's Commune in Wuchang County, Heilongjiang Province, is making overall plans for production and life, and is making early arrangements for commune members to prepare for the winter.

The commune's Party committee, based on the spirit of neither weakening the needs of agricultural production nor guaranteeing that commune members are fully prepared for the winter, has appropriately arranged labor and organized professional teams for building kang beds and plastering walls, and has prepared winter supplies for commune members through the life service stations. In addition to concentrating on managing the autumn fields and preparing autumn harvesting tools, commune members also take advantage of rainy days to remove old kang beds and replaster them, repair stoves, and improve cooking facilities.

Thanks to such careful and unified arrangements, the entire commune is doing a good job in both production and winter preparations. Currently, more than 17,000 mu of dry land have been hoed in the autumn, and the paddy fields have all been weeded and the weeds on the field ridges have been cut. Regarding autumn harvest preparations, sixteen rice harvesting and milling machines have been prepared, and thirty-eight carts have been repaired. More than 2,500 kang beds have been built, 300,000 bundles of firewood have been gathered, and a large number of cotton-padded clothes and shoes have been made.

    五常县红旗公社安排过冬准备工作
    据新华社讯　黑龙江省五常县红旗人民公社统一规划生产和生活，及早安排社员过冬的准备工作。
    公社党委本着既不削弱农业生产的需要，又保证社员作好过冬的充分准备的精神，适当安排劳力，组织了砌炕抹墙专业队和打柴小组，通过生活服务站为社员们准备过冬事项。此外，社员们除集中力量管理秋田和准备秋收工具外，也利用阴雨天扒炕抹墙，修炉改灶。
    经过这样周密的统一部署，全社生产和过冬准备工作都做得很好。目前，旱田已有一万七千多亩完成秋锄，稻田都已薅锄，并且割完了田埂上的杂草。秋收准备方面，已备好收打稻机、制米机十六台，修理好大车三十八辆。砌炕完成二千五百多铺，打柴三十万捆，还做出了大批棉衣和棉鞋。
