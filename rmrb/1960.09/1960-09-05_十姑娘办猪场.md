    Ten Girls Run Pig Farm
    This spring, the commune Party committee called for raising a large number of pigs. Communist Party member Long Jinzhi, Communist Youth League member Huang Meizhi, and eight other girls applied to the Party committee to set up a pig farm.
    The Party committee instructed them to "run the farm diligently and thriftily." The ten girls picked up carrying poles and shouldered shovels. Some pounded the earth, some carried soil, and they started building a pig farm with eight pigsties. The building materials were old bricks they had cleared and some sticks, so they didn't use a penny of the commune's money.
    Raising pigs requires feed, so they started reclaiming wasteland. Since they didn't have oxen, Long Jinzhi and Gao Qiaoyun held the plow, and the other girls pulled it. The wasteland was hard and full of grass. Every furrow meant a body covered in sweat. The girls did not bow their heads to difficulties. They worked hard all spring and cultivated thirty mu of wasteland, planting it all with pig feed. Thanks to the hard work of the ten girls, they now have seventy fat pigs.

### 十姑娘办猪场

    十姑娘办猪场
    今年春天，公社党委号召大量养猪，共产党员龙金枝，共青团员黄美枝等十个姑娘向党委申请要办一个猪场。
    党委指示她们要“勤俭办场”，十个姑娘拿起扁担、扛起铁锹，打硪的打硪，挑土的挑土，动手盖起八个猪圈大的猪场。建场材料是她们清理的旧砖和一些棍棍棒棒，因此，没用公社一文钱。
    养猪，要有饲料，她们就动手开荒，没有耕牛，龙金枝、高巧云两个人扶犁，其余的姑娘拉犁，生荒地地硬草多，一条垅沟一身汗，姑娘们没有向困难低头，苦干一春，开出了三十亩荒地都种上了猪饲料。由于十个姑娘的艰苦劳动，现在已有七十头肥猪。
