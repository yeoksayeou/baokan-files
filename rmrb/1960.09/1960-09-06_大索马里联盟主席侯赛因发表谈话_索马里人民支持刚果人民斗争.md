    Great Somali League Chairman Hussein Speaks
    Somali People Support the Struggle of the Congolese People
    He also said: The Chinese People Love Peace and Resolutely Oppose Imperialism
    Xinhua News Agency, September 5th. Hashi Mohamed Hussein, Chairman of the Great Somali League, who is currently visiting China, said in an interview with this agency's reporter on the 4th that the US imperialist interference in the internal affairs of the Congo under the guise of the "United Nations" is an act of aggression. "We support the struggle of the Congolese people, support their struggle for the unification of the Congo, and the US imperialist interference in the Congo is a manifestation of the nature of imperialism."
    Hussein also said that US imperialism also interferes in the internal affairs of Somalia. US imperialism uses "aid" as a cover to carry out economic aggression against Somalia. He pointed out that the Somali people will stand together with the people of the world to resolutely fight against US imperialism and fight for the unification and freedom of their motherland.
    Hussein said that hundreds of millions of people around the world stand on the side of the Somali people, and we will definitely be able to overcome difficulties and achieve victory.
    Hussein expressed his great pleasure at the news that Cuban Prime Minister Castro had announced the recognition of the People's Republic of China and severed all relations with the Chiang Kai-shek clique. He said that the Somali people and the Great Somali League resolutely demand that the Somali government recognize New China, and recognize this great China that has made great contributions to human endeavors.
    Abduallahi Hashi, a member of the Central Committee of the Great Somali League who was present at the time, told reporters that Cuba's wise decision has strengthened the forces in the world against imperialism. This is a heavy blow to US imperialism.
    Hashi also condemned US imperialism for plotting to have the Somali government recognize the Chiang Kai-shek clique. Hashi said: "Our people are willing and determined to establish friendly relations with the people of New China who resolutely fight against imperialism, and resolutely oppose the recognition of the Chiang Kai-shek clique."
    Speaking about his impressions of visiting China, Hussein said that although our visit to China was relatively short, we saw that the Chinese people are resolutely opposed to imperialism. In the past one hundred years, the Chinese people have waged arduous struggles and learned a truth from the Chinese experience, that all imperialism is a paper tiger.
    Hussein said: "However, we also see that the Chinese people love peace and are vigorously building their motherland." He also said that I visited the United States in 1959 and saw with my own eyes the war education received by American youth, but I did not see this kind of warmongering atmosphere in China. Although this is a small example, it also shows that the Chinese people and their leaders love peace.
    They also enthusiastically praised China's Great Leap Forward and people's communes. Hashi said that the Chinese people are experiencing the era of the Great Leap Forward, have completed many incredible tasks, and are advancing towards industrialization. He also said that we see that the people's communes are building a better future, making the lives of people who were unable to eat their fill and were poorly clothed under the oppression of imperialism better and better.
    Hussein also said that the Chinese people have full freedom of religious belief. This left a deep impression on him. Hussein finally expressed his hope that more friendly relations would be established between Somalia and China, and that exchanges between the people of the two countries would be strengthened.

    大索马里联盟主席侯赛因发表谈话
    索马里人民支持刚果人民斗争
    他还说：中国人民热爱和平坚决反对帝国主义
    新华社5日讯　正在我国访问的大索马里联盟主席哈希·穆罕默德·侯赛因4日在接见本社记者时说，美帝国主义利用“联合国”的招牌对刚果内政的干涉是一种侵略行为。“我们支持刚果人民的斗争，支持他们要求刚果统一的斗争，美帝国主义对刚果的干涉是帝国主义本性的表现。”
    侯赛因还说，美帝国主义也干涉索马里的内政。美帝国主义利用“援助”作幌子，对索马里进行经济侵略。他指出，索马里人民将同全世界人民在一起，坚决地同美帝国主义进行斗争，并为祖国的统一和自由而斗争。
    侯赛因说，全世界有千百万人民站在索马里人民这一边，我们一定能够克服困难，取得胜利。
    侯赛因对古巴总理卡斯特罗宣布承认中华人民共和国并同蒋介石集团断绝一切关系的消息，表示十分高兴。他说，索马里人民和大索马里联盟坚决要求索马里政府承认新中国，承认这个在人类事业中作出了巨大贡献的伟大的中国。
    当时在座的大索马里联盟中央委员阿布杜勒希·哈希对记者说，古巴的这个英明的决定，加强了世界上反对帝国主义的力量。这是对美帝国主义的一个沉重打击。
    哈希还谴责美帝国主义曾策划索马里政府承认蒋介石集团。哈希说：“我们人民愿意和坚决同帝国主义作斗争的新中国人民建立友好关系，而坚决反对承认蒋介石集团。”
    在谈到访问中国的观感时，侯赛因说，我们在中国访问的时间虽然比较短，但是我们看到中国人民是坚决反对帝国主义的。过去一百年中，中国人民进行了艰苦的斗争，从中国的经验中得出一条真理，就是一切帝国主义都是纸老虎。
    侯赛因说：“但是，我们同样看到中国人民是热爱和平的，他们正在大力建设自己的祖国。”他还说，我曾在1959年访问过美国，亲眼看到美国青年受到的战争教育，但我在中国没有看到这种好战的气氛。这虽然是很小的例子，但这也说明了中国人民和他们的领导人是热爱和平的。
    他们还热情地赞扬了中国的大跃进和人民公社。哈希说，中国人民正在经历大跃进的时代，完成了许多难以置信的工作，并正在向工业化挺进。他还说，我们看到人民公社正在建设更美好的未来，使过去在帝国主义压迫下吃不饱、穿不暖的人们生活得越来越好。
    侯赛因还说，中国人民有充分的宗教信仰自由。这点给他留下了深刻的印象。　　侯赛因最后表示希望索马里和中国之间建立起更友好的关系，加强两国人民之间的来往。
