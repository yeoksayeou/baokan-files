    Xinhua News Agency, September 23rd - According to the "Hindustan Times," Indian Finance Minister Desai recently spoke again about India's foreign exchange difficulties when leaving New Delhi to discuss India's foreign exchange problems in London and Washington. He emphasized that "India's foreign exchange has been reduced to a minimum, and it is impossible to use foreign exchange again until new foreign loan assistance is obtained to supplement it."
    It is reported that in a letter to his cabinet colleagues before his departure, Desai said that all foreign exchange-related debts should be postponed until he returns next month. The newspaper emphasized that "under these circumstances, it is said that imports are impossible, because it is estimated that the deficit of the original debt is nearly 1.5 billion rupees." At present, India's foreign exchange reserves are only more than 1.4 billion rupees.
    The "Hindustan Times" predicts that India's imports in the next six months will not exceed 1 billion rupees, which means a reduction of 800 million rupees. Recently, Indian Prime Minister Nehru proposed strictly restricting domestic consumption and increasing exports to obtain foreign exchange.
    Xinhua News Agency, London, September 23rd - Following talks between British Chancellor of the Exchequer Lloyd and Indian Finance Minister Desai, London announced today that Britain will grant India a loan of £35 million.
    In the next six months, Britain will provide India with £5 million as funds for India to import British goods.
    In addition, in order for India to be able to order projects for India's Third "Five-Year Plan" starting in April 1961, Lloyd informed the Indian Finance Minister that Britain is also prepared to provide loans totaling £30 million.
    The British Treasury also announced that Britain and India have reached an agreement to hold further talks on the issue of Britain providing funds for the expansion project of the Durgapur Steel Plant in India, which is currently under construction. The cost of this expansion is estimated at approximately £20 million.
    After the talks, Desai said that India still lacks the foreign exchange needed for the second half of the Second "Five-Year Plan". It is reported that for the Third "Five-Year Plan", India has also decided to borrow approximately £20 million from West Germany and no less than £35 million from the United States.

    印度财政部长德赛说
　  印度外汇减少到最低限度
    英国宣布给印度三千五百万英镑贷款
    新华社23日讯　据“印度斯坦时报”报道，印度财政部长德赛不久前在离开新德里前往伦敦和华盛顿讨论印度的外汇问题时再一次谈到印度外汇困难的情况。他强调说，由于“印度的外汇已经减少到最低限度，直到获得新的外国贷款援助补充之前不可能再动用外汇。”
    据悉，德赛在动身前夕写给他的内阁同僚的一封信中说，所有涉及外汇的债务应当延期处理，直到下月他回来为止。这家报纸强调说，“在这种情况下，据说要进口是不可能的，因为估计原有债务的赤字将近十五亿卢比。”而目前印度的外汇储备只有十四亿多卢比。
    “印度斯坦时报”预计，今后半年内印度的进口额不会超过十亿卢比，这意味着削减了八亿卢比。最近印度总理尼赫鲁提出了严格限制国内消费，增加出口，从而获得外汇的主张。
    新华社伦敦23日电　在英国财政大臣劳埃德和印度财政部长德赛会谈以后，伦敦今天宣布，英国给予印度三千五百万英镑贷款。
    在今后六个月中，英国将供给印度五百万英镑，作为印度进口英国货物的资金。
    此外，为了使印度能够为1961年4月开始的印度第三个“五年计划”的工程订货，劳埃德通知印度财政部长，英国还准备提供总数达三千万英镑的贷款。
    英国财政部还宣布，英、印两国已经达成协议，将就英国为正在建造中的印度杜尔加柏炼钢厂的扩建工程提供资金问题，再次举行会谈。这项扩建费用估计约为二千万英镑。
    德赛在会谈后表示，印度仍然缺少第二个“五年计划”后半期所需的外汇。据悉，印度为了第三个“五年计划”，还决定向西德借进大约二千万英镑，向美国借进不少于三千五百万英镑。
