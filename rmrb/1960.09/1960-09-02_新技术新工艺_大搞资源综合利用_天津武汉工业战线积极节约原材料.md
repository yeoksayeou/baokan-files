Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, September 1st: Workers on Tianjin's industrial front are engaging in technical revolution during the increasing production and practicing economy movement, seeking raw materials, materials, and fuel from technical revolution. They compared the raw material consumption of their factory's products with that of brother units, found learning targets, and then formulated a fighting goal and specific measures to reduce consumption, launching a competition where one portion of raw materials is used as several.

Reducing the consumption of major raw materials such as coal and iron is the main focus of the workers in various factories. The city's factories have widely promoted advanced experiences such as gas furnaces, mixing with sludge, and mixing with furnace slag, which has reduced coal consumption by 15% to 30%. Workers in the casting workshops of the electromechanical industry are concentrating their efforts on extensively "consuming" white cast iron. The advanced experiences of more than thirty units such as the North China Sewing Machine Factory in improving melting rate, desulfurization rate, and improving proportioning have been widely promoted throughout the city, greatly reducing the consumption of cast iron.

The majority of workers are seeking raw materials, materials, and fuel through technical revolution, mainly by adopting new techniques and new processes. The electromechanical industry is actively reforming product design to make products small in size, light in weight, and high in efficiency. More than one hundred and forty products in the electromechanical industry have been "reborn." After appraisal and finalization, they have been universally put into production. According to statistics of only seventy of these products, more than eight thousand tons of steel and nine hundred and seventy thousand man-hours can be saved in a year. Workers in the chemical industry have adopted new techniques and processes to save a large amount of important raw materials such as acids and alkalis. Workers in the textile industry have made breakthroughs in the technology of using wild miscellaneous fibers to spin yarn and weave cloth. They have already used wild fibers to spin more than two thousand eight hundred pieces of cotton yarn and weave more than sixteen thousand meters of cloth.

Workers in various factories are also vigorously promoting comprehensive utilization, extracting industrial raw materials from waste materials, waste liquids, and waste gases, turning useless into useful. More than one hundred and forty factories in the steelmaking, ironmaking, and casting industries are using slag to build slag cement on a large scale, and have already produced more than fifteen thousand tons. Various wood processing factories are using wood chips to make fiberboard. Chemical industry factories have installed recovery tanks, recovery towers and other equipment to recover and utilize waste gas and waste liquid in large quantities. The Tianjin Pesticide General Factory alone can increase production by more than six thousand tons of chemical raw materials recovered and extracted from waste gas and waste liquid in a year.

Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, September 1st: In the spirit of diligence and thrift in running enterprises, Wuhan workers have saved a large amount of raw materials, materials, fuel, electricity and labor in the past six months. Among them, steel alone has been saved by more than eight thousand eight hundred tons, coal by two hundred and forty-three thousand tons, and electricity by more than nine million four hundred and seventy thousand kilowatt-hours. There have also been great achievements in saving other raw materials such as pig iron, coke, wood, cement, gasoline, and diesel.

Since the fourth quarter of last year, Wuhan has carried out a mass movement to save electricity, labor, raw materials, and materials, achieving greater results. Since the beginning of this year, this movement has been closely integrated with the technical innovation and technical revolution movement centered on "four modernizations," with even greater effects. Under the slogan of "seeking materials and labor from product revolution," the employees of the machinery industry department have actively reformed product designs since May. The various factories under the Municipal Mechanical and Electrical Bureau alone have innovated the designs of more than nine thousand kinds of products. By the end of July, seventy kinds had been formally put into production. After innovating the design of a gantry planer produced by Wuhan Heavy Machinery Plant, each machine saves more than five tons of pig iron, and the machine performance is good. In terms of saving electricity, the city has widely promoted the advanced experience of "four-in-one" ring power supply and planned power supply, and has carried out activities for the entire people to run electricity, manage electricity, and save electricity. Many factories, mines, enterprises, restaurants, and canteens have actively realized steamization, gasification, and biogasification, saving a large amount of coal.

Due to the promotion and adoption of new technologies and new experiences by various factories, mines, and enterprises, labor productivity has been improved, and "increased production and increased tasks without increasing manpower" or "increased production and reduced manpower" has been achieved. The Wuhan Iron and Steel Company Power Plant originally planned to increase more than one thousand eight hundred and fifty people. Later, after vigorously carrying out technical innovation and technical revolution, and adjusting the production organization, not only did it not increase people, but also saved more than one hundred and ninety people.

Many factories, mines, and enterprises have also vigorously promoted comprehensive utilization of resources. In the first half of the year alone, factories in the chemical system extracted hundreds of new products from waste materials and waste liquids, creating a large amount of wealth for the country.

    新技术新工艺　大搞资源综合利用
    天津武汉工业战线积极节约原材料
    新华社天津1日电　天津市工业战线职工在增产节约运动中大闹技术革命，向技术革命要原料、材料和燃料。他们把本厂产品的原材料消耗情况，同兄弟单位对比，找到学、赶对象，然后制订降低消耗的奋斗目标和具体措施，开展起一份原材料顶几份用的竞赛活动。
    降低煤、铁等主要原材料的消耗，是各厂职工的主攻方向。全市各工厂普遍推广了煤气炉、掺烧污泥、掺烧炉碴等先进经验，已经使煤耗降低15％到30％。机电行业铸造车间的职工，正在集中力量大“吃”白口铁。华北缝纫机厂等三十多个单位创造的提高熔化率、脱硫率、改进配比等先进经验，已在全市普遍推广，使铸造生铁的消耗量大为降低。
    广大职工向技术革命要原料、材料、燃料，主要靠采用新工艺、新技术。机电行业积极改革产品设计，使产品达到体积小、重量轻、功效高的要求。机
  电行业现在就有一百四十多种产品“脱胎换骨”，经过鉴定、定型，普遍投入了生产。仅据其中七十种产品的统计，一年就可节约钢材八千多吨，工时九十七万个。化学工业职工采用新工艺新技术，节约了大量酸碱等重要原料。纺织行业职工突破利用野杂纤维纺纱织布的技术关，已利用野生纤维纺出棉纱两千八百多件，织布一万六千多米。
    各厂职工还大搞综合利用，从废料、废液、废气提炼工业原料，变无用为有用。炼钢、炼铁、铸造等行业一百四十多个工厂，利用矿渣大造矿渣水泥，已生产了一万五千多吨。各个木材加工厂正在利用木屑造纤维板。化工行业各厂安装了回收罐回收塔等设备，大量回收和利用废气、废液，仅天津市农药总厂从废气废液中回收提炼的化工原料，一年就可以增产六千多吨。
    据新华社武汉1日电　武汉市职工本着勤俭办企业的精神，半年多来节约了大批原料、材料、燃料、电力和劳动力。其中仅钢材就节约了八千八百多吨，煤二十四万三千吨，电九百四十七万多度。其他生铁、焦炭、木材、水泥、汽油、柴油等的节约，也都有了很大成绩。
    武汉市从去年第四季度起开展了群众性的节约电力、劳动力和原料、材料的运动，获得较大成绩。今年以来，这个运动同以“四化”为中心的技术革新和技术革命运动紧密结合，效果更大。机械工业部门职工在“向产品革命要材料和劳动力”的口号下，自5月份以来积极改革产品设计，仅市机电局所属各厂就革新了九千多种产品的设计，到7月底止已有七十种正式投入生产。武汉重型机床厂生产的一种龙门刨床革新设计以后，每台节约生铁五吨多，机床性能良好。在节约用电方面，全市普遍推广了“四合一”环形供电、计划供电的先进经验，并开展了全民办电、管电、节约用电的活动。许多厂矿企业、餐馆、食堂积极实现蒸汽化、煤气化、沼气化，节约了大量煤炭。
    由于各厂矿企业推广和采用新技术、新经验，提高了劳动生产率，做到了“增产增事不增人”或“增产又减人”。武钢动力厂原计划要增加一千八百五十多人，后来经过大闹技术革新和技术革命，调整了生产组织，不但没有增加人，还节约出一百九十多人。
    许多厂矿企业还大搞资源综合利用，仅化工系统各厂上半年就从废料、废液中提炼出上百种新产品，为国家创造了大量财富。
