Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu Electric Telegram. Sichuan Leshan Prefecture's Mojiang Coal Mine employees have created an indigenous rapid coking kiln—the Mojiang Kiln. Compared with the Pingxiang Kiln, which is popular throughout the country, it has the advantages of short coking time, high coking rate, and good desulfurization effect.

After the Mojiang Kiln was promoted throughout the prefecture, the coking time was generally shortened from five or six days to two or three days, the coking rate increased from 60% to 70% to 85% to 95%, and the sulfur content of coke was also reduced compared with the original. After appraisal by relevant departments, it is considered that the Mojiang Kiln is a major innovation in indigenous coking, which can not only increase output but also improve quality.

This new type of coking kiln was successfully transformed on the basis of the Pingxiang Kiln. The difference in structure from the Pingxiang Kiln is that the bottom of the Pingxiang Kiln is tile-bottom shaped, with high sides and a low middle. When loading coal for coking, the sides are thin and the middle is thick, making it difficult for the fire to burn through the thick layer in the middle, resulting in a longer coking time. The Mojiang Kiln, on the other hand, has a kiln bottom that is tile-back shaped, with low sides and a high middle. When loading coal for coking, as long as the coal is also loaded in a tile-back shape, so that the thickness of the coal layer in the kiln is the same on all four sides, and then using a low fire position and high chimney, adding fierce fire to burn, the coal layer can be evenly burned through, shortening the coking time.

In the process of transforming the kiln type, leading cadres of the Leshan Prefectural Committee of the Communist Party of China and coal mine party secretaries personally went to the site to study and operate with the workers, so that this reform was quickly tested and succeeded.

The Leshan Prefectural Committee of the Communist Party of China attached great importance to this new creation and immediately held an on-site meeting at the Mojiang Coal Mine to promote it. After the meeting, the Prefectural Committee organized the coking workers of the Mojiang Coal Mine to go to various coking sites in the area to impart experience. At present, most of the indigenous coke ovens have been transformed according to the Mojiang Kiln. In all units where this new type of coke oven has been promoted, the output and quality of coke have been rapidly improved.

### 四川创造土法快速炼焦窑  沫江窑产量高焦质好

    四川创造土法快速炼焦窑
    沫江窑产量高焦质好
    新华社成都电　四川乐山专区沫江煤矿职工创造了一种土法快速炼焦窑——沫江窑。它同全国盛行的萍乡窑比较，具有焦化时间短、结焦率高和脱硫效果好等优点。
    全专区推广沫江窑以后，炼焦时间普遍由五、六天缩短到两三天，结焦率由60％至70％提高到85％至95％，焦炭含硫量也比原来有所降低。经有关部门鉴定，认为沫江窑是土法炼焦的一项重大革新，既可以增加产量，也可以提高质量。
    这种新型炼焦窑是在萍乡窑的基础上改造成功的。它在构造上跟萍乡窑不同的是：萍乡窑底部是瓦底形，两边高，中间低，装煤炼焦时两边薄，中间厚，火力不易烧透中间的厚层，因而焦化时间较长，而沫江窑与此相反，窑底是瓦背形，两边低，中间高，装煤炼焦时，只要把煤也装成瓦背形，使窑里的煤层厚度四边相同，再用低火位、高烟囱，加猛火燃烧，就可以均匀地烧透煤层，缩短焦化时间。
    在改造窑型中，中共乐山地委领导干部和煤矿党委书记都亲自到现场，同工人们一起研究，一起操作，使这一改革迅速试验成功。
    中共乐山地委非常重视这一新的创造，立即在沫江煤矿召开现场会加以推广。会后，地委又组织沫江煤矿的炼焦工人到全区各炼焦场传授经验。目前大部分土焦窑都按照沫江窑进行了改造。凡是推广了这种新型焦窑的单位，焦炭的产量和质量都得到迅速提高。
