        Loosening the Soil in the Autumn Fields
    We, greeting the morning glow, came to the cornfields of Southeast Changlong, and braving the sweet dew, fought alongside the commune members of the Second Production Team of the Zhenglan Front Management Area of the Red Star Commune, who were loosening the soil in the autumn fields. The corn leaves were covered with glistening dewdrops. Before half an hour had passed, the commune members' clothes were soaked with dew, and the women's hair looked as if it had been washed with water. Sweat and dew mingled together, dripping down their cheeks. But the commune members were still full of energy, talking and laughing, and no one was willing to fall behind. They composed a quick-clapper rhyme and sang: "Our energy soars like a fierce tiger, we fear neither rain nor frost, we create a happy new life, and are willing to irrigate the crops with our sweat." How precious is this heroic spirit of the commune members! From this, I saw the farmers' determination and perseverance to make great efforts in grain production.
    The sun slowly rose, and the dew gradually disappeared. When it was time to rest, some sat on the ridges chewing sweet stalks, while others wrung out their clothes that had been soaked by the dew. At this time, I was thinking: The commune members' energy is truly commendable, but loosening the soil in the autumn fields in the early morning with the dew will affect their health. So, how can we solve this problem? I took advantage of the break to discuss it with everyone. Team leader Guan Xianzhu said that a little dew is not cold, and we can work like this. Someone suggested that each person should bring two tools when going to the field, to engage in field fertilizer accumulation when there is dew, and then loosen the soil in the autumn fields after the dew has dissipated. I felt that this suggestion made sense. Old commune member Wang Dianqing said, "This is called working cleverly. We can loosen the soil in the autumn fields and accumulate manure, killing two birds with one stone, and people won't suffer." Therefore, it was decided to do this the next day.
      I first heard the term "loosening the soil in the autumn fields" in 1958 when I came to the Northeast. At that time, I thought that loosening the soil in the autumn fields was a historical legacy of the "Great Northern Wilderness" of shallow cultivation and rough work. But after this practice, I had a deeper understanding of it. In the current North, where there is a lot of land but few people and the level of mechanization is not high, loosening the soil in the autumn fields is very necessary. This year, there has been a lot of rain, and some weeds have been removed and then regrown, and some corn has been bullied by the tall weeds and is yellow and thin. How to solve this problem requires meticulous ideological work. Therefore, in the process of working with the commune members, we specifically inspected one hundred corn plants, of which nineteen were still green. The autumn fields that had just been loosened, with the tall weeds cut down, were ventilated and transparent to light. This fact educated everyone, and also educated myself, that we must seize the opportunity, concentrate our efforts, and make a concentrated effort to loosen the soil in the autumn fields.
            Field Propaganda
    During the second break, we held a meeting in the field to further publicize the importance of making great efforts in agriculture and grain production. As soon as I finished speaking, commune member Xu Fengsheng said with a smile, "What the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao said is exactly what we are thinking." Everyone said that they must mobilize everyone who can work to participate in loosening the soil in the autumn fields and make great efforts in grain production. This morning, everyone loosened one and a half ridges, which was half as fast as yesterday morning. At noon, when returning to the canteen for lunch, everyone also cut a bundle of green grass to feed the horses.
    Walking back to the canteen, I chatted with women's team leader Liu Shulan about the reasons for the low attendance of women. Some were at home taking apart and washing bedding and making cotton clothes, and some could not go to distant places to loosen the soil in the autumn fields because they were not in good health or had breastfeeding children pulling at them. In response to these situations, we held a women's symposium during the lunch break. Once the significance of making great efforts in agriculture and grain production was explained, everyone immediately gained new energy and unanimously agreed to concentrate their efforts on loosening the soil in the autumn fields first, and then take turns taking leave to take apart and wash bedding and make cotton clothes. At the same time, women's attendance was arranged household by household, according to local conditions and people. Thirty-six women in the first and second lines loosened the soil in the autumn fields, while women in the third line dried vegetables or accumulated fertilizer in the village. Three women strung red peppers in the canteen. In this way, they all went to work that afternoon. Obviously, the lives of the masses need to be well arranged. In the face of these specific and complex things, I have a deeper understanding that doing concrete leadership is much more difficult, but also much more important.

    田头小记	中共黑龙江望奎县委第一书记　王元钧
        放　秋　垅
    我们迎着朝霞，来到东南长垅玉米田，顶着甘露，同红星公社正蓝前头管理区第二生产队放秋垅的社员在一起鏖战。玉米叶上挂满了晶莹的露珠，没用上半个钟头，社员们的衣服都被露水浸透了，妇女的头发像水洗的一样，汗水和露水溶合在一起，顺着脸颊滴滴哒哒地淌下来。可是社员仍是干劲冲天，有说有笑，谁也不肯落后一步。他们编快板诗唱道：干劲冲天赛猛虎，雨露风霜不怕苦，创造幸福新生活，甘愿汗水灌五谷。社员们这种英雄气概该是多么可贵！从这里我看到了农民对大办粮食的决心和毅力。
    太阳慢慢地升起来，露水渐渐地消下去。到歇气的时候，有的坐在垅台上嚼着甜秆，有的在拧被露水浸湿了的衣服。这时我在想：社员们这股干劲真可贵，但是早晨顶着露水放秋垅是会影响身体健康的，那么怎样解决这个问题呢？便趁休息时间和大家商量起来。队长关显祝说，有点露水也不凉，这样干可以。有人提议每人下地带两件工具，有露水搞田间积肥，露水消了再放秋垅。我觉得这个意见有道理。老社员王殿清说：“这叫巧干，放了秋垅，又积了粪肥，两全其美，人还不遭罪。”因此，决定第二天就这样干。
      “放秋垅”这个词是我1958年来到东北才听说的，当时认为放秋垅是“北大荒”浅耕粗作的历史遗产，而经过这次实践对它的理解深刻了。在当前地多人少、机械化程度不高的北方，放秋垅是很必要的。今年雨水大，有些杂草除而复生，有些玉米被大草欺得又黄又瘦。如何解决这个问题，是需要做细致的思想工作的。所以在同社员劳动过程中，我们具体检查了一百棵玉米，其中有十九棵贪青；刚放过的秋垅，大草砍掉了又通风又透光，这个事实教育了大家，也教育了自己，当前必须抓紧时机，集中力量，突击放秋垅。
            田头宣传
    第二次歇气时，我们在田头开了个会，进一步宣传了大办农业、大办粮食的重要性。我的话音刚一停，社员徐风生笑哈哈地说：“党中央和毛主席说的正是我们心里想的。”大家表示，一定把能出勤的人都动员出来参加放秋垅，大办粮食。今天一上午，每人放了一垅半，比昨天上午快一半；晌午回食堂吃饭每人还割一捆喂马的青草扛着。
    走在回食堂的路上，我便和妇女队长刘淑兰唠起妇女出勤不多的原因，有的在家拆洗被褥和做棉衣，有的因为身体不好或吃奶孩子扯腿不能到远地放秋垅。针对这些情况，我们在午休的时间开了个妇女座谈会，把大办农业、大办粮食的意义一说，大家立刻增添了新干劲，一致同意先集中力量放完秋垅，再轮流放假拆洗被褥和做棉衣。同时，因地因人制宜，逐户安排了妇女出勤人数，一、二线的妇女三十六名都放秋垅，三线的妇女在屯子里晒干菜或积肥，有三名妇女就在食堂里串红辣椒。这样，当天下午她们就都出勤了。显然，群众的生活是需要很好安排的。在这些具体复杂的事物面前，我更加深刻地体会到，做具体的领导艰巨得多，但也重要得多。
