    American Capital and India
    Editor's Note: The American "Business Week" published an article on July 9th, reporting on the investment of American monopoly enterprises in India. Excerpts are translated and published below:

    For American industrialists, India is a huge future market, a place with great potential for investment.

    According to the current Third Five-Year Plan, the Indian government needs to invest $14.7 billion, with domestic and foreign private capital investing $8.4 billion. This is where American industrialists come in.

    For some time, a moderate amount of American capital has been entering India. At the end of last year, this amount was estimated to be over $125 million. Total foreign private investment in India is approximately $1.2 billion, mainly from Britain.

    This year, due to the increasing number of industrialists exploring opportunities, the increase in American investment may be enough to bring the total to $200 million.

    Around next year, American companies will likely build chemical plants, fertilizer plants, paper and pulp mills, automobile and auto parts factories, electrical equipment factories, cement plants, machine tool factories, metal structure and wood structure factories, and so on.

    Almost all of these investments are joint ventures. Most will have 49% or less American capital. Accepting this legal restriction is not easy for some American companies. They have solved this difficulty by including clauses in the partnership agreement that allow them to obtain the management control they deem satisfactory.

    An American industrialist, Edgar Kaiser, chairman of Kaiser Industries, believes that joint ventures—even with only a minority stake—are "the best way you can get assurance that your investment in foreign operations is protected from nationalization."

    To some extent, if foreign companies want to enter the Indian market, they have to invest. India greatly restricts imports in order to conserve its meager foreign exchange reserves. On the other hand, India is encouraging investment in the production of export goods to earn foreign exchange.

    Other factors luring capital are cheap and abundant labor and proximity to raw material sources. Another reason American companies are starting to invest in India is that the Indian government is encouraging such investment quite vigorously.

    Among the specific incentives for potential American investors are safeguards against expropriation, tariff concessions that American tariff experts consider more favorable than anywhere else in the world, and a situation where profits are relatively easy to repatriate.

    Washington is also encouraging American private investment to go hand in hand with economic aid. For example, a treaty providing that Americans investing in India can receive "exemption" from American tariffs on profits earned in India has been submitted to the Senate for approval.

### 美国资本和印度

专栏：外论摘要

    美国资本和印度
    编者按　7月9日出版的美国“商业周刊”刊登了一篇文章，报道美国垄断企业对印度投资的问题，现摘译发表如下：
    对美国实业家来说，印度是将来的一个巨大市场，是在投资方面有极大潜力的地方。
    根据现在的第三个五年计划，印度政府需要投资一百四十七亿美元，国内外私人资本投资八十四亿美元。这里就轮到美国实业家了。
    一些时候以来，一直有适中数量的美国资本进入印度。去年年底，这个数目估计已达到一亿二千五百万美元以上。在印度的外国私人投资总共约有十二亿美元，以英国为主。
    今年，由于试探机会的实业家的人数越来越多，美国投资的增加可能足以使总数达到二亿美元。
    明年前后，美国公司大概将修建化学工厂、肥料厂、纸厂和纸浆厂、汽车和汽车零件厂、电气设备厂、水泥厂、工作母机厂、金属结构和木材结构厂等等。
    几乎所有这些投资都是联营事业。大部分都将有49％或者少于49％的美国资本，接受这种法律上的限制对某些美国公司来说是不容易的。他们通过在合伙协定中订进一些能够使它们在管理方面得到它们认为满意的控制权的条款，解决了这件难事。
    一位美国工业家、凯塞工业公司董事长埃德加·凯塞认为联营事业——即使只能占少数——是“你所能得到的保证你在外国经营中的投资免遭国有化的最好的办法”。
    在某种程度上，如果外国公司想进入印度市场，它们就不得不进行投资。印度大大限制进口以便保存它的微薄的外汇储备。另一方面，印度正在鼓励生产出口货物的投资来赚得外汇。
    其他引诱资本前去的因素就是劳动力便宜而充足，原料来源又近。美国公司所以开始在印度投资还有另外一个原因——印度政府正在相当大力地鼓励这种投资。
    在对潜在的美国投资者的具体刺激办法当中，有防止征用的保障办法，有美国关税专家认为比世界上任何别的地方都更优惠的关税让步，以及利润比较容易收回这样一种情况。
    华盛顿也正在鼓励美国私人投资，以同经济援助齐头并进。例如，有一项规定向印度投资的美国人在印度赚得的利润可以得到“免去”美国方面的关税这种宽容条件的条约，已经提交参议院等待批准。
