Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, September 22nd: Guinean President Sékou Touré reiterated his support for Congolese Prime Minister Lumumba at a press conference held in Jakarta this afternoon. He said, "Because he represents the legitimate government of the Congo, we will continue to provide him with support." He also said, "We stand with the Congo, not only because we are of the same skin color, but also because the issue of freedom is indivisible."

Touré said, "The colonialists are trying to create chaos and disturbance in the Congo, but they will not succeed."

President Touré said that during his meeting with President Sukarno this afternoon, they discussed and studied some major international issues related to the two countries and reached a consensus on these issues.

A reporter asked him if he had been informed that Colonel Mobutu had requested the withdrawal of Guinean and Ghanaian troops from the Congo. He replied that he was not aware of this. However, he said, "As far as we are concerned, this will not make us feel uneasy, because there is a democratic system in the Congo, and also a regime that exercises power on behalf of the people. The Guinean and Ghanaian troops will act as usual."

A reporter asked him about his attitude towards disarmament. He replied, "We link the issue of disarmament with the struggle for independence and ending colonialism." He said that some people are armed to liberate and defend themselves, while others are armed to oppress others. He added, "We support disarmament as much as we support independence."

Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, September 22nd: Guinean President Sékou Touré met with Anwar Tjokroaminoto, Chairman of the Indonesian Asian-African Solidarity Committee, and representatives of many political parties and mass organizations in Indonesia at the State Palace in Jakarta this afternoon.

President Touré told them that Asian-African solidarity is very important, "because solidarity can enable us to gain liberation and sovereignty, because solidarity is a tool for building a new world." He said that the people of Asia and Africa must struggle and strengthen solidarity. "We are the majority," invincible, and imperialism will perish.

He pointed out that if independence is one of the conditions for achieving peace, then it is not enough to achieve only political independence. Economic independence must also be achieved. Touré concluded by saying that the people of Guinea firmly believe that they will have a bright future. They will fight alongside those who are willing to fight.

Anwar Tjokroaminoto, Chairman of the Indonesian Asian-African Solidarity Committee, expressed a warm welcome to Touré's visit in his speech. He said that imperialism and colonialism are carrying out divisive activities in the Congo and are carrying out blatant interference while wearing various masks. In Algeria and Oman, they are continuing colonial wars, and in West Irian and parts of Africa, they are still continuing colonial rule. At this moment, it is very important for the people of Asian and African countries to have unified views, solidarity, and cooperation, so that they can force imperialism to get out of these regions.

After the speech, the Indonesian Asian-African Solidarity Committee, the All-Indonesia Central Trade Union, the Indonesian Peasants' Front, and other mass organizations jointly presented gifts to President Touré.

Those present at today's meeting included Ali Sastroamidjojo, Chairman of the Indonesian Nationalist Party, D.N. Aidit, Chairman of the Indonesian Communist Party, Lukman, Vice-Chairman, Abas, Chairman of the Perti Islamic Party, and many other political party leaders, as well as Mrs. Hidayat, Chairman of the Indonesian Peace Committee, and representatives of workers, peasants, youth, women, and other mass organizations.

　　杜尔总统在雅加达举行记者招待会
　　重申继续支持刚果总理卢蒙巴
　　指出裁军问题应当同争取独立和结束殖民主义的斗争联系起来
    据新华社雅加达22日电　几内亚总统塞古·杜尔今天下午在雅加达举行的记者招待会上重申支持刚果总理卢蒙巴。他说，“因为他代表合法的刚果政府，我们将继续对他提供支持。”他还说，“我们站在刚果方面，这不仅是由于我们的肤色相同，而且也是由于自由问题是不可分割的。”
    杜尔说，“殖民主义者企图在刚果制造混乱和纷扰，但是他们是不会成功的。”
    杜尔总统说，他今天下午同苏加诺总统会谈时，讨论和研究了对两国有关的某些重大国际问题，并对这些问题取得了一致的看法。
    有记者问他，他是否获悉蒙博托上校已经要求几内亚和加纳的部队退出刚果。他回答说，他还不知道这一点。但是，他说，“就我们而言，这将不会使我们感到不安，因为在刚果有民主制度，此外还有代表人民行使权力的政权。几内亚和加纳的部队将照常行动。”
    有记者问他对裁军的态度，他回答说，“我们是把裁军问题同争取独立和结束殖民主义的斗争联系起来的。”他说，有些人武装起来是为了解放并保卫他们自己，有些人武装起来是为了压迫别人。他又说，“我们就像支持独立一样支持裁军。”
    据新华社雅加达22日电　几内亚总统塞古·杜尔今天下午在雅加达国家宫会见了印度尼西亚亚非团结委员会主席安瓦尔·佐克罗阿米诺托和印度尼西亚的许多政党和群众团体的代表。
    杜尔总统对他们说，亚非团结非常重要，“因为团结能使我们获得解放和主权，因为团结是缔造新世界的工具”。他说，亚洲非洲人民必须进行斗争和加强团结。“我们是多数”，是不可战胜的，而帝国主义将要灭亡。
    他指出，如果独立是争取和平的条件之一，那么只取得政治独立是不够的。还必须取得经济独立。杜尔最后说，几内亚人民深信，他们自己将有光明的前途。他们将同愿意进行斗争的人并肩共同斗争。
    印度尼西亚亚非团结委员会主席安瓦尔·佐克罗阿米诺托在讲话中对杜尔的访问表示热烈欢迎。他说，帝国主义和殖民主义在刚果进行分裂活动，并且戴着各种假面具进行粗暴的干涉。在阿尔及利亚和阿曼，他们在继续进行殖民战争，而在西伊里安和非洲一部分地方，他们还在继续进行殖民统治。在这个时刻，亚非各国人民的见解一致、团结和合作，是十分重要的，那样将能迫使帝国主义滚出这些地区。
    讲话之后，印度尼西亚亚非团结委员会、全印度尼西亚中央职工会、印度尼西亚农民阵线以及其他群众团体联名向杜尔总统赠送了礼物。
    出席今天的会见的有印度尼西亚国民党总主席阿里·沙斯特罗阿米佐约，印度尼西亚共产党主席艾地、副主席鲁克曼，白尔蒂伊斯兰党主席阿巴斯和其他许多政党的领袖，还有印度尼西亚和平委员会主席希达雅特夫人以及工人、农民、青年、妇女和其他群众团体的代表们。
