　　This newspaper reports: According to the New Hunan Daily, Hunan Province's early rice procurement and storage work is being done quickly and well. By September 6th, Xiangtan Region, Shaoyang Region, Changsha City, and Yongxing, Qidong, Ningyuan, Changde City, Cili, Guiyang, Yizhang, Anhua, Leiyang and other counties and cities had successively completed the early rice procurement and storage tasks assigned by the state.
    The speed and quality of these regions in completing their procurement tasks are primarily due to the close attention paid to this work by Party committees at all levels. When the new grain came on the market, they conscientiously implemented the principle of “overall consideration and comprehensive arrangement” for grain procurement and distribution, and vigorously launched mass movements. In the procurement and storage work, Party secretaries at all levels in these counties personally took charge, going deep into the front line to grasp the procurement and storage work. In Changsha County, from the county to the commune and brigade levels, specialized leading bodies for grain storage were established, led by the secretaries, with designated personnel responsible. Song Yunliang, the first secretary of the Shuangfeng County Party Committee, and Jiang Yuanteng, the secretary of the County Party Committee, personally took charge, convening two meetings of commune Party committee secretaries and four telephone conferences, as well as a broadcast meeting for cadres above the level of work team leader. The secretary in charge of finance and trade also held a special telephone conference to specifically study and arrange early rice procurement and distribution.
    In their procurement and storage work, these regions adhered to the principle of overall consideration, carefully arranging the grain needed by the state, the collective, and the commune members. Generally, on the basis of verifying yields and according to the prescribed standards, they reserved sufficient grain for commune members' rations, seeds, fodder, and other uses, and rationally arranged the early rice procurement tasks. For example, in Weidong and Xinqiang Communes of Yueyang County, the grain procurement and distribution policies were explained before the early rice harvest. On the basis of raising the ideological awareness of cadres, yields were determined by team, and early rice procurement tasks were balanced among the major brigades in conjunction with grain distribution, thereby stimulating enthusiasm for handing over and selling procured grain. After reasonably arranging the procurement tasks, the Sanyi Brigade of Xinqiang Commune completed the procurement and storage of 250,000 jin of early rice in one day and one night.
    In the procurement and storage work, the communes and brigades rationally arranged for a certain amount of labor to transport grain based on the needs of grain delivery and the current production situation. Some regions mobilized the masses to take advantage of the scattered time during early and late work shifts to carry out concentrated delivery and sale, ensuring that production and grain delivery did not interfere with each other.
    In the procurement and storage work, preparations for storage were generally made early, and collection points were rationally arranged. A comprehensive inspection and repair of roads, bridges, docks, and warehouse equipment along the way was carried out. Tea stations, medical stations, and shelters were also set up along the way to meet the needs of the grain delivery teams. In order to ensure the quality of the stored grain, many grain department cadres went deep down, adopting the method of “four arrivals to the team” (personnel, tools, samples, prices), so that the new grain stored generally met the standards of being dry, clean, and full.

　　既保证了国家需要　又安排好人民生活
　　湖南早稻征购入库又快又好
　　湘潭、邵阳专区和许多县市都已完成任务
    本报讯　据新湖南报消息：湖南省早稻征购入库工作作得又快又好。到9月6日止，已有湘潭专区、邵阳专区、长沙市和永兴、祁东、宁远、常德市、慈利、桂阳、宜章、安化、耒阳等县、市相继完成了国家分配的早稻征购入库任务。
    这些地区征购任务完成的快、好，首先是各级党委对这项工作抓的紧。在新粮登场时就认真贯彻执行了
  “统筹兼顾、全面安排”的粮食征购、分配原则，大搞群众运动。征购入库工作中，这些县各级党委书记亲自挂帅，深入第一线，抓征购入库工作。长沙县由县到公社、大队，都成立了粮食入库专门领导机构，由书记挂帅，确定专人负责。双峰县委第一书记宋运良同志和县委书记姜远腾同志亲自抓，先后召开两次公社党委书记会议和四次电话会议，一次作业组长以上干部广播大会。财贸书记又专门召开了电话会议，对早稻征购、分配都做了具体研究和布置。
    这些地区在征购入库工作中，都本着统筹兼顾的原则，认真安排了国家、集体、社员所需的粮食。一般在核实产量的基础上，按照规定的标准，留足了社员口粮、种子、饲料粮等各项用粮，合理安排了早稻征购任务。如岳阳县渭洞、新墙等公社在早稻收割前就交代了粮食征购、分配政策，在提高干部思想觉悟的基础上，分队落实了产量，结合粮食分配，平衡了各大队的早稻征购任务，从而激发了交售征购粮的积极性。新墙公社三义大队在合理安排了征购任务以后，一天一晚就完成了二十五万斤早稻征购入库任务。
    征购入库工作中，各公社、大队都根据送粮的需要和当前生产的情况，合理地安排了一定劳力送粮。有的地区通过发动群众，利用早、晚出工散工时间突击送售，作到生产、送粮两不误。
    在征购入库工作中，一般都及早做好了入库准备工作，合理摆布了收购点。对沿途的道路、桥梁、渡口及仓库设备，都进行了全面检查、维修。沿途还设立茶水站、医疗站、凉棚，保证了送粮队伍的需要。为了保证入库粮食的质量，不少粮食部门干部深入下去，采取人员、工具、样品、价格“四到队”的办法，使入库的新粮一般都符合干、净、饱满的标准。
