Xinhua News Agency, Washington, September 13th: Japanese Foreign Minister Zentaro Kosaka held the first meeting between the two countries in Washington with US Secretary of State Herter on September 12th since the Ikeda government came to power. The joint communiqué issued after the meeting emphasized that Japan and US imperialism should further strengthen their collusion based on the aggressive military alliance treaty.

The joint communiqué, decorated with the words "peace," stated that Kosaka and Herter discussed "the international situation" during their meeting. The communiqué emphasized: Herter and Kosaka "agreed that it is important for the two countries to cooperate closely within the framework of the newly concluded Mutual Cooperation and Security Treaty."

The communiqué referred to the US's infringement upon Japanese sovereignty and its occupation and control of Japan as a "friendly relationship," and stated that Herter and Kosaka "noted with satisfaction" this "friendly relationship" between the United States and Japan in the political, economic, and cultural fields.

The joint communiqué stated that Herter and Kosaka also "exchanged views on various issues in Asia" and agreed that it would be "beneficial to maintain close contact and consultation on issues of common interest" in the region. The communiqué also stated that both sides expressed "hope" that relations between Japan and South Korea "could be improved rapidly." Prior to this, Western newspapers had revealed that the United States had been eager to "normalize" relations between Japan and South Korea in order to formally establish a Northeast Asian aggressive bloc. To this end, Kosaka had engaged in activities in South Korea before visiting the United States.

The communiqué only stated that the two sides "discussed issues of common interest related to the Ryukyu Islands" and made no mention of returning these islands to Japan.

The communiqué affirmed the "trade liberalization" policy that facilitates the dumping of American goods into Japan. The communiqué stated that trade between the two countries should be expanded in the future on a "free and orderly basis." The Japanese Foreign Minister expressed his intention to implement a "relaxation plan" for the import of American goods "as soon as possible." The communiqué stated: "The Secretary of State welcomed this."

The communiqué revealed that the two sides also discussed their collusion in intensifying economic expansion and penetration into "underdeveloped countries." The communiqué stated: "The Secretary of State and the Foreign Minister agreed that it is extremely necessary for industrialized countries to assist the economic development of underdeveloped countries." Japan should "like the United States" "continue to provide economic assistance according to their economic capabilities."

According to United Press International, Kosaka also handed Herter a personal letter from Japanese Prime Minister Hayato Ikeda for him to forward to Eisenhower. Kosaka indicated that the letter "expressed regret" over Eisenhower's cancellation of his visit to Japan in June due to the firm opposition of the Japanese people. Kosaka also said: "Our invitation remains valid," and if Eisenhower visits Japan, "we will be ready at any time."

    赫脱小坂发表会谈公报
    日美两国决定加强勾结
    据新华社13日讯　华盛顿消息：日本外务相小坂善太郎12日在华盛顿同美国国务卿赫脱举行了池田政府上台以后的第一次两国会谈。会后发表的两国联合公报，强调日本和美帝国主义要根据侵略性军事同盟条约进一步加强勾结。
    这个用“和平”的字样装饰起来的联合公报说，小坂同赫脱会谈时“讨论了国际局势”。公报强调说：赫脱和小坂“一致认为两国在新近缔结的共同合作和安全条约范围内进行密切的合作是重要的”。
    公报把美国侵犯日本主权，占领和控制日本的状况称作是“友好关系”，并且说，赫脱和小坂“满意地注意到”美国和日本在政治、经济和文化方面的这种“友好关系”。
    联合公报说，赫脱和小坂还就
  “亚洲的各种问题交换了意见”，并且一致认为就这个地区“有共同利害关系的问题保持密切的接触和磋商是有好处的”。公报还说，双方都表示“希望”日本和南朝鲜的关系“能够迅速改善”。在这以前，西方报界曾经透露，美国为了正式建立东北亚侵略集团，一直在渴望日本和南朝鲜的关系“正常化”。为了这件事，小坂在访美以前曾到南朝鲜活动。
    公报只说，双方“讨论了有关琉球群岛的有关共同利益关系的问题”，没有提到把这些岛屿归还日本。
    公报肯定了便于美国商品向日本倾销的“贸易自由化”政策。公报说，今后两国之间要在“自由的和有秩序的基础上”扩展贸易。日本外务相表示要“尽快地”对美国商品的进口实行“放宽计划”。公报说：“这番话受到了国务卿的欢迎”。
    公报透露，双方还讨论了两国在加紧向“不发达国家”进行经济扩张和渗透的阴谋上的勾结。公报的说法是：“国务卿和外务相一致认为，工业化国家协助不发达国家的经济发展是极其必要的。”日本应该“像美国一样”“继续按照它们的经济能力提供经济援助”。
    据合众国际社报道，小坂还把日本首相池田勇人的一封亲笔信交给赫脱，让他转交艾森豪威尔。小坂表明，这封信对于艾森豪威尔今年6月由于日本人民的坚决反对而取消访日之行“表示遗憾”。小坂并且说：“我们的邀请仍然有效”，如果艾森豪威尔访问日本，“我们将随时做好准备”。
