    “If it weren’t for the People's Commune…”
     —A Record of the Deeds of the Datai Production Team of the Tong’erbu Commune in Liaoyang City in Rescuing Disaster Victims Yang Shaoshan Zhou Hongda
      Risking Life to Save Fellow Villagers
    After the rainstorm on August 3rd, the Taizi River experienced a flood unseen in a century. The Xutai Production Team of the Tong’erbu People's Commune in Liaoyang City, located downstream of the Taizi River, was quickly surrounded by floodwaters, and hundreds of people in the entire team were in danger!
    The news immediately reached the Datai Production Team headquarters, located twenty li away from Xutai. Some commune members said: The people of Xutai are surrounded by floods, just like we would be; we must find a way to rescue them. Some commune members said: As brothers in the same commune, we must not stand idly by. “I’ll go,” “I’ll go too,” many people volunteered, vying to rescue the people of Xutai. After discussion, the team branch committee decided to take action in three ways: organize commune members who can swim to immediately swim to the rescue; organize people to build rafts, preparing to cross the river to receive the disaster-stricken people; and another group of people to arrange food and shelter for the disaster victims.
    At daybreak, the young and strong people who could swim, with the urgent desire to rescue class brothers, swam to the embankment leading to the Xutai Brigade. Leading the team was production team leader Sun Deying, and each of them was full of energy and high morale!
    "People from Datai are here to pick us up!" The commune members of the Xutai Production Team, who had been surrounded by water for one or two days, shouted excitedly as if they had seen long-lost relatives. Liu Zhongren's wife, whose family lived in Datai, was happier than anyone else when she heard that the people of Datai were coming to pick them up, and she was the first to pack her bags and prepare to leave, and the rest of the commune members also began to prepare to leave. However, there were also some people, especially the elderly with mobility issues, who were afraid of adding to the burden of others and did not want to leave their homes. We must persuade them even if we have to wear out our mouths! The rescue team went to each household to mobilize them, telling them that the Datai Production Team had prepared everything for them. The disaster victims were moved when they heard these words, and even those who didn't want to go decided to go. Before long, hundreds of rescue team members arrived, jumped into the water, and used their hands to support the rafts, sending the disaster victims safely to the dam, one trip after another.
                  Human Bridge
    These people who had been surrounded by the flood for one or two days felt as if a heavy burden had been lifted from their hearts as they stepped onto the dam, and they headed straight for Datai along the dam embankment.
    Unexpectedly, they were blocked by a canal two zhang wide and one zhang deep. This canal, which usually carries the heavy task of irrigating hundreds and thousands of mu of nearby farmland, had turned into a rushing torrent, with turbulent currents and rolling waves. Those who went down to explore the water conditions were swept away a long distance. The disaster victims, seeing this scene, became nervous again after just calming down. At this time, the rescue team members wanted to build a pontoon bridge with wooden planks; however, the water surface was wide and the planks were short, and they were washed away by the rapids several times. The bridge was not successfully built, and there was no time for other solutions. Commune member Li Hongwen walked out from the crowd and shouted loudly: "Let's build a human bridge and let everyone walk over it." This idea was unanimously approved. In an instant, eight young men, carrying planks, jumped into the water, and a stable and solid human bridge was built in a few words. The disaster victims walked over it one by one; however, some women looked very scared when they walked over it, and the rescue team members supported them on both sides. Before long, a large group of people had passed by.
    The bridge builders were shivering from the cold because they had been soaking in the water for a long time and were carrying a very heavy load. Despite this, they had a fiery heart to rescue their class brothers, and they could overcome even colder floods. The human bridge stood still in the rapids, and the disaster victims continued to walk over it. At this time, most of the remaining people were women holding babies and elderly people. The rescue team members took even more careful care of them. When several blind people crossed the bridge, someone helped them step by step; a woman holding a child almost fell when she got off the embankment, but Li Xi quickly caught the child… In this way, a total of two hundred and sixty-eight disaster victims safely reached the other side in more than three hours. The bridge builders then came out of the water, and some of them persevered from beginning to end, their shoulders red and swollen from the pressure. Seeing this situation, many disaster victims were so grateful that they did not know what to do, and kept asking for their names, treating them as their saviors!
            Restore Production and Rebuild Homes
    The Xutai disaster victims received meticulous care from the people of Datai. The whole village, from the south street to the north street, from the east end to the west end, every household vacated their spare houses. Many commune members would rather have their families sleep on board beds on the ground than give their kangs to the disaster victims. The three public canteens of the brigade, the cooks were even busier. They took out the rice and millet that they usually were reluctant to eat for the disaster victims. Some disaster victims said with emotion: If it weren't for this society, if it weren't for the people's commune, in such a big flood, let alone eating rice, we wouldn't even have anywhere to beg for rice soup! Especially some elderly people, recalling the past, were even more filled with emotion.
    A few days passed, the water gradually receded, and the disaster victims returned to their hometowns one after another. In order to minimize the losses from the disaster, they actively launched a production upsurge of "production for disaster relief, rebuilding homes." When replanting autumn vegetables, they couldn't get a plow into the wet soil, so they poked a hole with a small stick, sowed the seeds, and then covered them with soil; if the first planting was flooded, they would plant a second time; if the second planting was flooded again, they would plant a third time; now, they have planted five times continuously on four to five hundred mu of land, and finally the seedlings have emerged.
    The work of rebuilding homes for the commune members has progressed very rapidly thanks to the collective strength of the people's commune. The team allocates dozens of people every day to specially repair houses for the commune members whose houses were washed away. By the time we left here, the commune members had all moved into their houses. (Attached picture)

    “要不是有人民公社………………”
     ——记辽阳市佟二卜公社大台生产队抢救灾民的事迹	杨绍山　周洪达
      冒险救乡亲
    8月3日暴雨过后，太子河出现了百年罕见的洪水。位于太子河下游的辽阳市佟二卜人民公社徐台生产队，很快被洪水包围起来，全队几百口人都处在险境里！
    消息立即传到离徐台二十华里的大台生产队队部。有的社员说：徐台人民被洪水包围，也和我们被包围一样；想啥办法，也得把人救出来。有的社员说：一个公社的弟兄，我们绝不能袖手旁观。“我去”，“我也去”，许多人都自报奋勇，争着去抢救徐台人民。经过商量，队支委会决定，分三路行动：组织会水的社员，立即泅水去抢救；组织人扎木筏子，准备渡河去接灾胞；另一部分人为灾民安排吃食住处。
    天刚亮，一个个会水的青壮年，怀着抢救阶级弟兄的迫切心情，游水赶到了去徐台大队的堤上。走在队伍前头的是生产队长孙德英，他们个个精神焕发，斗志昂扬！
    “大台来人接我们来了！”被水包围的徐台生产队的社员们，就像见了久别的亲人一样，兴高采烈喊叫着。刘忠仁的妻子，娘家住在大台，她听说大台人民来接他们过去，比谁都高兴，第一个打好包准备走的是她，其余的社员也都张罗着走。但是也有一些人，特别是那些腿脚不伶俐的老年人，怕增加别人的困难，不想离开家。就是磨破嘴也要把他们说服啊！抢险队员分头深入各家各户，进行动员，告诉他们大台生产队一切都已经为大家准备好了。灾民们听了这些话，本来不想去的人，也感动得决定去了。不大工夫，就来了好几百名抢险队员，他们跳入水中，用手撑着木筏子，一趟趟把灾民安安稳稳送上了大坝。
                  人　桥
    这些已经被洪水包围了一、两天的人们上了大坝，顿时心情好像卸下了千斤重担一样地轻松下来，沿着大坝坝埂，直奔大台走来。
    不料，眼前被一条两丈宽一丈来深的渠道拦住了去路。平时的这条渠道，担负着灌溉附近几百几千亩良田的重担，可是今天它变成了拦路的洪流，水势湍急，波涛滚滚，探水情的人下去就被冲出去好远。灾民们看到这般情景，刚刚平静下来的心情，一时又紧张起来。这时，抢险队员们想用木板子搭座浮桥；可是，水面宽，木板短，放下去几次都被急流冲走了。桥没有搭成功，别的办法已经来不及了，从人群中走出社员李洪文高声喊道：“咱们搭座人桥，让大家从上边走过去。”这个主意，得到一致赞同。刹那间，八个小伙子，扛起板子一涌跳入水中，一道平稳结实的人桥，没用几句话的工夫就筑了起来。灾民们一个个从上边走过去；但是，有些妇女从上边走的时候，看样子很害怕，抢险队员们就在两边搀扶着她们。不大一会儿，就过去了一大群人。
    筑桥人因为在水中已经泡了很久，冻的直打哆嗦，压的非常沉重。尽管这样，但他们有一颗抢救阶级兄弟的火热的心，比这再冷的洪水，他们也能战胜它。人桥一动不动地矗立在急流之中，灾民们陆续的走过去。这时，剩下的人，多数都是一些抱着婴儿的妇女和年迈的老人。抢险队员们对他们的照顾更是小心倍至。几个盲人过桥的时候，一步步都有人扶着；一个妇女抱着孩子，刚下坝埂，险些摔倒，这时，李锡扑眼急手快，急忙给她接过来孩子……。就这样，总共二百六十八个灾胞，用了三个多小时，一个个都安全地到了对岸。筑桥的人这时才从水中上来，他们之中，有的人从始至终坚持到底，肩膀压的红的红，肿的肿。灾民们看到这种情形，许多人感激得不知怎样才好，一劲问他们姓什么，叫什么，都把他们当成了自己的救命恩人！
            恢复生产　重建家园
    徐台灾胞来到大台，受到了大台人民无微不至的照顾。全村人从南街到北街，从东头到西头，家家户户都把自己多余的房子腾了出来。许多社员，宁肯自己家人搭板铺睡在地上，也要把炕让给灾民睡。大队的三个公共食堂，炊事员们忙得更是手脚不闲。他们把平日自己舍不得吃的大米、小米拿出来给灾民们吃。有的灾民感动地说：要不是这个社会，要不是有人民公社，这样大的水灾，不用说是吃大米，就是米汤，也没处去讨啊！特别是一些老年人，回忆起往事，更是感慨万分。
    几天过去，水渐渐退了，灾民们陆续回到了自己的家乡。他们为了尽量减少受灾损失，积极掀起了“生产救灾、重建家园”的生产高潮。在抢种秋菜时，地皮湿进不去犁扙，他们就用小棍插个眼，往里下种，然后再培上土；一次种上被淹了，再种第二次；第二次种上又被淹了，就种第三次；现在，他们在四、五百亩的土地上，已经连续种了五次，终于出苗了。
    社员们重建家园的工作，由于有了人民公社这个集体的力量，进展十分迅速。队里，每天都拨出几十个人，专门为被冲的社员修盖房屋。到我们离开这里的时候，社员们已经全部都搬进房子里去住了。（附图片）
