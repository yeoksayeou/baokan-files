    Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, August 31st. The Laotian Combat Forces Radio today broadcast a letter from the Central Committee of the Lao Patriotic Front to all officers and soldiers of the Royal Army, calling on them to stand with the Laotian people and resolutely struggle against the new conspiracy of the U.S. imperialism and the Chao Songsanit-Phoumi Nosavan reactionary clique, and to implement a truly peaceful and neutral policy.
    The appeal said, "The Chao Songsanit-Phoumi Nosavan clique is the most dangerous reactionary clique. They stubbornly offer the interests of the motherland and the lives of the people to U.S. imperialism in exchange for U.S. dollars. In order to carry out the orders of U.S. imperialism, they have committed countless crimes in Laos, burying the lives of thousands of soldiers."
    The appeal continued, the coup committee's overthrow of the Chao Songsanit-Phoumi Nosavan clique, and its declared policies of ending the civil war, driving out U.S. imperialism, putting Laos on the path of true peaceful neutrality, and achieving harmony among the Laotian people, are entirely in line with the interests and aspirations of all the Laotian people. The Lao Patriotic Front fully supports the coup committee and its policies.
    The appeal pointed out: "At present, U.S. imperialism and its stooges, having suffered heavy defeats, have become even more flustered and insane. The Chao Songsanit-Phoumi Nosavan clique is conspiring to lure and force brothers to attack and massacre the military and civilians of Vientiane who launched the coup. They are doing this solely for their own interests and power. In this emergency, the Lao Patriotic Front calls on all officers and soldiers of the Royal Army not to be fooled by the Chao Songsanit-Phoumi Nosavan clique, to firmly protest their orders, and to oppose attacking the brothers in Vientiane who launched the coup; to learn from the anti-American and patriotic example of the Vientiane troops, to rise up and replace the commanders who are pro-American and pro-Chao Songsanit-Phoumi Nosavan clique, to thoroughly implement the orders of the coup committee, and together with the people, to resolutely fight against the new conspiracy of U.S. imperialism and the Chao Songsanit-Phoumi Nosavan clique, to demand an end to the civil war, to achieve national harmony, and to implement true peaceful neutrality."
    The appeal concluded by saying that all officers and soldiers should demonstrate the spirit of anti-American patriotism and jointly fight.
    Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, August 31st. The Laotian Combat Forces Radio today published a commentary, strongly condemning the U.S. imperialism's stooge - the reactionary Thai government - for interfering in Laotian internal affairs, and demanding that the Thai government must immediately stop its interference and aggression against Laos.
    The commentary pointed out that after the Second Parachute Battalion and the people of Vientiane, under the leadership of Captain Kong Le, held a coup on August 9th and overthrew the Chao Songsanit-Phoumi Nosavan government, "the Phoumi Nosavan clique ran to Thailand to carry out treasonous activities, requesting the Thai government to interfere against the coup committee and the government, attempting to restore their rule. Since then, the reactionary Thai government, a stooge of U.S. imperialism, has been conspiring to help the Phoumi Nosavan clique in all aspects."
    The commentary pointed out: The Thai government "helped the Phoumi Nosavan clique to establish a radio station in Savannakhet; economically besieged Vientiane; allowed Phoumi's troops to pass through Thailand and station themselves in Beishan to prepare to attack Vientiane; dispatched Thai military officers to operate in Phoumi's army; mobilized patrol boats and aircraft to strafe Lao government patrol boats; and secretly sent spies to Vientiane and other areas to carry out harassment activities."
    The above facts are blatant acts of interference in Laotian internal affairs by the Thai government.
    The commentary added that the Thai radio station also distorted the facts, slandered the coup committee and the Lao government, as well as the coup committee and the government's policies and lines, and spread rumors that Prince Souvanna Phouma had accepted aid from socialist countries. Prince Phouma has refuted these rumors. The commentary said that the above-mentioned distortion of facts by the Thai government is a blatant interference in Laotian internal affairs, because it is Laos' internal affair and the right of the Lao government and people to accept aid from any country in the world without political and military conditions.
    The commentary said, "The Laotian people are extremely indignant at the above-mentioned shameful actions of the Thai government. The Laotian people strongly oppose and strongly condemn the Thai government's interference to world public opinion. The Thai government must bear full responsibility for the above-mentioned actions and must immediately stop interfering in Laotian internal affairs."

    老挝爱国战线党号召王国军队全体官兵
    奋起反对美国走狗诺萨万集团
    寮国战斗部队电台谴责泰国政府干涉老挝内政
    新华社河内31日电　寮国战斗部队电台今天广播了老挝爱国战线党中央委员会告王国军队全体官兵书，号召他们同老挝人民站在一起，为反对美帝国主义和昭·松萨尼特—富米·诺萨万反动集团的新阴谋、实行真正的和平中立政策而坚决斗争。
    呼吁书说，“昭·松萨尼特—富米·诺萨万集团是最危险的反动集团。它们一意孤行地把祖国利益和人民的生命奉献给美帝国主义，以换取美元。为了实现美帝国主义的命令，它们在老挝制造了罄竹难书的罪恶，葬送了成千名士兵的生命。”
    呼吁书接着说，政变委员会推翻昭·松萨尼特—富米·诺萨万集团，以及它所宣布的停止内战、把美帝国主义赶走、使老挝走上真正的和平中立道路、使老挝人和睦的政策，完全符合全体老挝人民的利益和愿望。老挝爱国战线党全力支持政变委员会和它的政策。
    呼吁书指出：“目前，美帝国主义及其走狗在遭到沉重失败的情况下，变得更加惶乱和疯狂。昭·松萨尼特—富米·诺萨万集团正在阴谋诱骗和强迫兄弟们进攻和屠杀发动政变的万象军民。他们这种行为仅仅是为了他们的利益和权位。在这种紧急情况下，老挝爱国战线党呼吁王国军队全体官兵不要上昭·松萨尼特—富米·诺萨万集团的当，坚决抗议他们的命令，反对进攻发起政变的万象兄弟们；学习万象部队的反美爱国榜样，起来撤换亲美、亲昭·松萨尼特—富米·诺萨万集团的指挥官，彻底执行政变委员会的命令，和人民一起，为反对美帝国主义和昭·松萨尼特—富米·诺萨万集团的新阴谋，为要求停止内战、实现民族和睦，实行真正的和平中立而坚决斗争。”
    呼吁书最后说，全体官兵们要发挥反美爱国精神，共同起来进行斗争。
    据新华社河内31日电　寮国战斗部队电台今天发表评论，强烈谴责美帝国主义的走狗——泰国反动政府干涉老挝内政，并且要求泰国政府必须立即停止对老挝的干涉和侵略行动。
    评论指出，第二伞兵营和万象人民在贡勒大尉的领导下8月9日举行了政变，推翻了昭·松萨尼特—富米·诺萨万政府以后，“富米·诺萨万集团跑到泰国，进行叛国活动，请求泰国政府干涉，反对政变委员会和政府，企图恢复它们的统治地位。此后，美帝国主义的走狗泰国反动政府就阴谋从各方面帮助富米·诺萨万集团。”
    评论指出：泰国政府“帮助富米·诺萨万集团在沙湾拿吉建立广播电台；从经济方面围困万象；让富米的军队取道泰国进驻北汕准备进攻万象；派遣泰国军官到富米军队中活动；调动巡逻艇和飞机向老挝政府的巡逻艇扫射；密派间谍到万象和其它地区进行骚扰活动。”
    上述事实是泰国政府明目张胆地干涉老挝内政的行为。
    评论又说，泰国电台还歪曲事实，诬蔑政变委员会和老挝政府以及政变委员会和政府的政策、路线，并且散布谣言说梭发那·富马亲王接受了社会主义阵营各国的援助。对此，富马亲王曾经辟谣。评论说，泰国政府的上述歪曲事实的宣传，是一种露骨的对老挝内政的干涉，因为老挝政府接受世界上任何国家的不附带政治和军事条件的援助是老挝的内部事务，是老挝政府和人民的权利。
    评论说，“老挝人民对泰国政府上述可耻的行动感到无比愤慨。老挝人民极力反对和向世界舆论强烈控诉泰国政府的干涉行动。泰国政府对上述行动必须担负完全责任，必须立即停止对老挝内政的干涉。”
