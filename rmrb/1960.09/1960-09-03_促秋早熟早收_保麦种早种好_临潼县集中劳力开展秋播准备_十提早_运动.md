Promote Early Maturity and Early Harvest of Autumn Crops, Ensure Early and Good Wheat Planting
Lintong County Concentrates Labor to Launch "Ten Early" Campaign for Autumn Sowing Preparation

The "Ten Earlies" are: early processing of autumn fields; early transportation of sufficient base fertilizer; early determination of acreage; early preservation of soil moisture; early arrangement of labor and animal power; early selection of good seeds; early inspection of tools; early preparation of pesticides and machinery; early repair of canals; and early training of technical personnel.

(Reported by our newspaper) The Lintong County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, after investigation and research, summarized the "Six-Character Classic" for increasing the yield of wheat after autumn crops and promoted it comprehensively through on-site meetings. Now, the people of the county have applied this experience, concentrating more than 82% of the labor force, and have launched a high tide of "Ten Early" preparations for autumn sowing, centered on autumn field management.

Lintong County planted 200,000 mu more autumn crops this year than last year, reducing the area of reserved first-crop wheat land from the original 350,000 mu to 150,000 mu, and the area of wheat after autumn crops has increased accordingly. Under these circumstances, some people worry that because the first-crop wheat has decreased and the wheat after autumn crops has increased, the summer harvest next year will be greatly affected. Earnestly summarizing the experience of increasing the yield of wheat after autumn crops and enabling the people of the county to master and apply this experience has become a very important task. To this end, the County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party convened a meeting of the Party secretaries of various communes after the summer harvest to specifically discuss the issue of a bumper wheat harvest in 1961. In early August, Kang Enxun, the first secretary of the County Committee, led a working group to delve into five lower-yielding production teams in the Luo Zhang Management District of the Xinfeng Commune, including Zao'an, Miaodi, and Wanli, to organize grassroots cadres, technicians, and experienced old farmers to jointly summarize the six-character classic for increasing the yield of wheat after autumn crops—Early, Fine, Water, Fertilizer, Dense, and Management. For example, the 55 mu of wheat after autumn crops actually harvested by the Wanli Production Team this year were planted after corn. Because measures were taken in advance to apply super-yield fertilizer to the corn, increase irrigation for super-yield, implement artificial auxiliary pollination, prevent and control diseases and insect pests, and cut off the tops during the milk-ripe stage, and the entire stalks were pulled out when they were nine parts ripe, the land was vacated half a month earlier, and the planting of winter wheat was advanced to around September 20. Before sowing, sufficient base fertilizer was also applied, deep plowing and fine harrowing were carried out, and the amount of seeds sown per mu was two or three jin more than that of the first-crop wheat. In addition, during the later period of field management, the wheat after autumn crops was treated the same as the first-crop wheat, resulting in an average yield of 275 jin per mu. In contrast, the Miaodi Production Team did not take measures to promote early maturity of autumn crops, and the sowing period was delayed until after September 25 or even around October 10. Under the circumstances of urgent time and insufficient preparation work in advance, there was no deep plowing, the land preparation was rough, and the base fertilizer was insufficient, resulting in an average yield of only 130 jin per mu, with the lowest being only 50 or 60 jin.

Based on the above situation, according to the "Six-Character Classic" for increasing the yield of wheat after autumn crops, "Early" must come first. How to seize the "Early"? The County Committee summarized the experience of the "Ten Earlies" for autumn sowing preparation from production teams such as Zao'an and Wanli: 1. Apply fertilizer, water, and processing to autumn fields early to promote early maturity and early harvest of autumn fields to achieve early sowing; 2. Accumulate sufficient base fertilizer for wheat fields after autumn crops early and transport it to the fields; 3. Plan the autumn sowing area early and implement the "Three Guarantees" to ensure the tasks are fulfilled; 4. Water the "Tangshang Water" early for irrigated autumn fields, and cultivate the dry land autumn fields more to preserve soil moisture for wheat fields after autumn crops early; 5. Organize and arrange autumn sowing labor and animal power early to concentrate labor for a shock planting; 6. Select good seeds early and conduct germination tests; 7. Inspect the sowing tools early; 8. Prepare pesticides and machinery early; 9. Repair canals and field ridges early; 10. Train sowing technicians early. In order to promote the "Ten Earlies" experience, the County Committee held an on-site meeting in the Luo Zhang Management District of the Xinfeng Commune and launched a large-scale publicity and debate campaign throughout the county. Through publicity and debate, everyone's understanding has been further improved. The members of the Qianjin Production Team of the Huaqing Commune used the fact that their wheat after autumn crops was sown ten days earlier than that of the Dongzhao Small Team last year, resulting in an increase of 110 jin per mu compared to Dongzhao Village, which shows that the experience of "Early" first is completely correct.

Now, all communes in the county have concentrated a large amount of labor and invested in the "Ten Earlies" campaign for autumn sowing preparation centered on autumn field management. After adjusting the labor force, the Huaqing Commune has 85.6% of the labor force invested in the "Ten Earlies" campaign, cultivating, weeding, and topdressing autumn fields to promote early maturity and increased production of autumn crops. The Luo Zhang Management District of the Xinfeng Commune has also drawn out labor to vigorously carry out the manure accumulation campaign, accumulating an average of about 10,000 jin of fertilizer per mu for autumn sowing crops, and some of it has been applied to the fields or piled on the field heads. The county has transferred more than 23,700 laborers from all aspects, increasing the labor force participating in autumn field management and autumn sowing preparation to more than 82%. 94.5% of the county's 600,000 mu of autumn fields have been cultivated twice, 30% have been cultivated three times, and 78% have been topdressed to promote early maturity and early harvest of autumn fields, preparing conditions for early sowing of wheat after autumn crops.

    促秋早熟早收　保麦种早种好
    临潼县集中劳力开展秋播准备“十提早”运动
    “十提早”是：早给秋田加工；早运足底肥；早落实面积；早保好地墒；早安排好
    劳力畜力；早选好良种；早检修工具；早准备药械；早修好渠道；早训练技术人员。
    本报讯　中共陕西临潼县委经过调查研究，总结出回茬麦增产“六字经”，并通过现场会议作了全面推广。现在全县人民已经运用这一经验，集中82％以上的劳力，掀起了一个以秋田管理为中心的秋播准备“十提早”高潮。
    临潼县今年比去年多种了二十万亩秋田，使预留的正茬麦地面积由原来的三十五万亩减少到十五万亩，秋播的回茬麦面积相应增多。在这种情况下，有人担心因为正茬麦减少，回茬麦增多，明年夏季收成要受到很大的影响。认真总结回茬麦增产经验，使全县人民掌握和运用这些经验，就成为一项很重要的工作。为此，中共临潼县委曾在夏收以后，召开了各公社党委书记会议，专门就1961年小麦丰产问题进行了座谈。8月上旬，县委第一书记亢恩逊又带领工作组，深入新丰公社骆张管区的皂安、庙底、湾李等五个产量较低的生产队，组织基层干部、技术员和有经验的老农，共同总结了回茬麦增产经验六字经——早、细、水、肥、密、管。如湾李生产队今年实收的五十五亩回茬小麦，前茬播种的是玉米，由于事先采取给玉米大施超产肥、增浇超产水、实行人工辅助授粉，防治病虫害，乳熟期又砍去稍顶，当九成熟时就连秆拔下来等措施，提早半月把地腾出来，将播种冬小麦期提早到9月20日前后。播种前还施足了底肥，进行深翻和细耙细耱，每亩下种量也较正茬麦多二、三斤；再加上后期田间管理期间，把回茬麦和正茬麦一样看待，结果获得了平均亩产二百七十五斤的产量。与此相反，庙底生产队没有采取催秋早熟的措施，播期推迟到9月25日以后甚至到10月10日左右，在时间急促、事先准备工作做得不够的情况下，没有深翻，整地粗糙，底肥施得不足，结果平均亩产一百三十多斤，最低的只有五、六十斤。
    根据以上情况，按照回茬麦增产“六字经”种植冬麦，必须是“早”字当先。怎样抓早呢？县委从皂安、湾李等生产队又总结出秋播准备“十提早”的经验：一、提早给秋田加肥、加水、加工，促使秋田早熟、早收，做到早播种；二、提早给回茬麦田积足底肥，并运到地头；三、提早规划秋播面积，实行“三包”，任务落实；四、给水地秋田早浇“汤墒水”，旱地秋田多中耕，提早给回茬麦地保好地墒；五、提早组织安排秋播劳畜力，以便集中劳力突击抢种；六、提早选好良种并做好发芽试验；七、提早检修播种工具；八、提早备好农药器械；九、提早修好渠道和地边埂；十、提早训练播种技术人员。为了推广“十提早”经验，县委在新丰公社骆张管区，召开了现场会议，并在全县普遍展开了大宣传大辩论。通过宣传辩论，使大家的认识又提高了一步。华清公社前进生产队的社员，用他们去年回茬麦比东赵小队回茬麦早十天下种，结果比东赵村每亩增产一百一十斤的事实，说明“早”字当先的经验是完全正确的。
    现在全县各公社都集中了大量劳力，投入了以秋田管理为中心的秋播准备“十提早”运动。华清公社经过调整劳力，使全社有85.6％的劳力投入了“十提早”运动，给秋田中耕、锄草、追施增产肥，促使秋季作物早熟增产。新丰公社骆张管区也抽出劳力大力开展积肥运动，已给秋播作物平均每亩积肥一万斤左右，一部分已施到地里或堆在地头。全县已从各方面调出劳力两万三千七百多人，使参加秋田管理和秋播准备的劳力增加到82％以上，全县六十万亩秋田已有94.5％中耕了两遍，30％中耕了三次，78％追了肥，以促使秋田早熟、早收，为提早播种回茬麦准备了条件。
