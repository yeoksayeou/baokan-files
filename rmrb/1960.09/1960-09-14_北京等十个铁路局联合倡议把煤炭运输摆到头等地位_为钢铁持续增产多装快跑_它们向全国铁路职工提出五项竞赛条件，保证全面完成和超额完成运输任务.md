Xinhua News Agency, 13th. National railway workers are determined to work hard for the next 110 days to guarantee the continued leap forward in grain and steel production with high transport efficiency. Yesterday, ten railway bureaus, including the Beijing Railway Bureau, jointly proposed a friendly competition to all railway workers across the country, centered on grain and steel, to comprehensively fulfill and over fulfill transportation tasks.

These ten railway bureaus are: Beijing, Jinzhou, Taiyuan, Harbin, Mudanjiang, Jilin, Shenyang, Zhengzhou, Jinan, and Bengbu railway bureaus. They account for a large proportion of the national railway freight volume, especially in the transportation of major materials such as coal.

The proposal stated that coal and ore are the main "food" for iron and steel enterprises. Without coal and ore, there would be no iron and steel. Therefore, railway transportation departments must resolutely respond to the Central Committee's call to launch a campaign to increase production and practice economy centered on grain and steel, and give top priority to coal transportation in ensuring increased steel production. In order to guarantee high steel production, more loading and faster transportation are the major responsibility and glorious task of our railway workers.

The proposal put forward five competition conditions to railway workers across the country:

First, resolutely guarantee the completion of coal transportation tasks. The first priority is to deliver the cars well, ensuring no cars are owed. Adhere to the system of standby cars in coal mining areas; where there is coal, there should be more standby cars; transport as much as there is. In terms of road-mine cooperation, the railway should continue to promote the spirit of great collaboration, regarding the difficulties of others as its own. Railway and mine workers should work together with one heart and one mind, quickly loading and unloading, fully loaded to the ton, operate "coal dragon trains" well, and achieve high transport efficiency to guarantee high production. Railway workers should actively support and participate in the construction of coal storage yards, the overhaul of landslide-style high platforms, and the overall renovation of stations and mines. Complete the construction tasks of mine railway branch lines on schedule. We must ensure that blast furnaces are well-fed and full, to guarantee increased steel production.

Second, adhere to the principles of large unloading, large dispatching, and large loading, and focus on the central link of unloading. Under the leadership of the local Party committee, launch a large-scale unloading campaign. Integrate the mass unloading campaign with the technical revolution movement centered on the mechanization of loading and unloading, so that accumulated goods are moved, inventory is hauled away, and lines and roadbeds are cleared. On the basis of overfulfilling the number of cars to be unloaded by 5% and reaching 50% of the total daily unloading at night, strive to dispatch and load even more. In dispatching cars, we must implement the principle of "the whole country as one chessboard," establish a communist style of putting others before oneself, ensuring quality and quantity, with not a single car missing, and planting red flags at the dividing points of each railway dispatch.

Third, vigorously carry out safety and punctuality campaigns. Conscientiously implement technical management regulations, strictly conduct technical regulations examinations, and combine strengthening labor discipline with implementing the responsibility system, so that every cadre and worker becomes a model of complying with regulations and operating procedures. Achieve: everyone manages production, everyone manages safety, everyone does not violate regulations, everyone opposes violations, and resolutely guarantees safe and punctual operation. In order to improve transportation efficiency, we must adhere to running according to the timetable, taking passenger cars as the key, vigorously rectify the operating order, and gradually improve the punctuality rate of trains.

Fourth, do a good job in preventing cold and winter. Widely carry out the movement to love cars, roads, and equipment. Strengthen the maintenance and upkeep of technical equipment such as lines, locomotives, vehicles, communications, and signals, and do a good job in preventing cold and freezing of various equipment, especially strengthening the winter education of new employees. Use a dauntless spirit to overcome wind, frost, snow, and fog, ensure that equipment does not freeze, get damaged, or crack, locomotives do not slow down, and improve winter operating efficiency. In addition, we must do a good job in preventing the freezing of washed coal and ore, which is an important issue to ensure more loading and faster unloading in winter. Railway departments must work together with mines to take effective cold and freeze prevention measures to solve the problem of loading and unloading washed coal and ore.

Fifth, care for the lives of workers, first of all, pay attention to the combination of work and rest. Improve leadership style and working methods, go deep into the front line of production, eat, live, work, and consult with workers, and reasonably arrange workers' production, learning, recreational sports activities, and rest time.

The proposal called on all railway workers across the country, under the leadership of the Ministry of Railways and the provincial and municipal Party committees, to resolutely implement the general line, adhere to putting politics in command, vigorously launch mass movements, and ensure the victorious completion of the annual transportation tasks.

    北京等十个铁路局联合倡议把煤炭运输摆到头等地位
    为钢铁持续增产多装快跑
    它们向全国铁路职工提出五项竞赛条件，保证全面完成和超额完成运输任务
    新华社13日讯　全国铁路职工决心大干今后的一百一十天，以高运保证粮、钢生产继续跃进。昨天，北京铁路局等十个铁路局向全国铁路职工联合提出了一项开展一个以粮、钢为中心的全面完成和超额完成运输任务的友谊竞赛的倡议。
    这十个铁路局是：北京、锦州、太原、哈尔滨、牡丹江、吉林、沈阳、郑州、济南和蚌埠的铁路局。它们在全国铁路货运量中，特别是煤炭等主要物资的运输量中，占着很大的比重。
    倡议说，煤炭、矿石是钢铁企业的主要“粮食”，没有煤和矿石就没有铁和钢。因此，铁路运输部门必须坚决响应中央关于开展以粮、钢为中心的增产节约运动的号召，并在保证钢铁增产中把煤炭运输摆到头等地位。为了保证钢铁高产，多装、快运是我们铁路职工的重大责任和光荣任务。
    倡议向全国铁路职工提出了五项竞赛条件：
    第一，坚决保证煤炭运输任务的完成。首先是把车送好，做到一车不欠。坚持煤矿区备用车制度，哪里有煤，就在哪里多备；有多少，运多少。在路、矿协作方面，铁路要继续发扬大协作精神，把别人的困难看成自己的困难。路、矿职工同心协力，一条心，一股劲，快搬快装，满载足吨，开好“煤龙列车”，实现高运保高产。铁路部门职工要积极支援和参加修建储煤仓，大修滑坡式高站台和站、矿总体改造。按期完成矿山铁路支线修建任务。一定要让高炉吃饱、吃好，保证钢铁增产。
    第二，坚持大卸、大排、大装的原则，要突出的抓住卸车这一中心环节，在当地党委领导下，大搞卸车运动。把群众性的卸车运动与以装卸滑溜机械化为中心的技术革命运动套起来，作到积压的货位搬光，存货拉光，线路、道心清光。在超额完成应卸车数的5％，夜间卸车达到全日的50％的基础上，作到更多排、更多装。在排车上一定要贯彻“全国一盘棋”的方针，树立先人后己的共产主义风格，保质保量，一车不少，在各个铁路排车分界口插上红旗。
    第三，大搞安全、正点运动。认真执行技术管理规程，严格进行技术规章考试，要把加强劳动纪律与贯彻负责制相互结合起来，使每个干部和职工都成为遵守规章制度和操作规程的模范。做到：人人管生产，人人管安全，人人不违章，人人反违章，坚决保证安全正点行车。为了提高运输效率，要坚持按运行图行车，以客车为纲，大力整顿运行秩序，逐步提高列车正点率。
    第四，做好防寒过冬工作。广泛开展爱车、爱路、爱设备运动。加强线路、机车、车辆、通信、信号等技术设备的维修保养，做好各项设备的防寒防冻工作，特别是要加强新职工的过冬教育。用大无畏的精神战胜风、霜、雪、雾，保证设备不冻、不伤、不裂，机车不运缓，提高冬季作业效率。另外，还要作好洗煤、矿石的防冻工作，这是保证冬季多装快卸的重要问题。铁路部门必须同矿山共同努力，采取防寒防冻有效措施，解决洗煤和矿石装卸车问题。
    第五，关心职工生活，首先要注意劳逸结合。改进领导作风和工作方法，深入生产第一线，与职工同吃、同住、同劳动、同商量，合理安排职工生产、学习、文娱体育活动、休息时间。
    倡议号召全国铁路职工，在铁道部和各省、市委的领导下，坚决贯彻执行总路线，坚持政治挂帅，大搞群众运动，保证胜利地完成全年运输任务。
