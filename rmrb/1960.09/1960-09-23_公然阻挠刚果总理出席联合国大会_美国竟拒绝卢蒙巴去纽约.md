Xinhua News Agency, September 22nd dispatch from Leopoldville: On the 21st, a spokesman for the U.S. Embassy in the Congo outrageously announced that the United States would not grant diplomatic visas to Congolese Prime Minister Lumumba and five other members of the Congo's legitimate government to attend the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
	This spokesman, disregarding the fact that the Lumumba government is the legitimate government of the Congo trusted by the parliament, shamelessly clamored that the United States "cannot treat Lumumba as the official delegation of the Congolese government and grant him a visa."
	Prior to this, Lumumba had accused the "United Nations Headquarters," manipulated by the United States, of refusing to provide him with any means of transportation in order to obstruct him from going to the United Nations General Assembly to state the true situation in the Congo.
	At the same time, Mobutu, the Congolese Army Chief of Staff who launched an armed rebellion in an attempt to overthrow the legitimate government of the Congo, also threatened to arrest Lumumba if he went to the United Nations.

    公然阻挠刚果总理出席联合国大会
　  美国竟拒绝卢蒙巴去纽约
    据新华社22日讯　利奥波德维尔消息：21日，美国驻刚果大使馆发言人竟公然宣布，美国将不给刚果总理卢蒙巴和刚果合法政府其他五位成员前往纽约出席联合国大会的外交签证。
    这个发言人不顾卢蒙巴政府是得到议会信任的刚果合法政府的这一事实，无耻地叫嚣说，美国“不能把卢蒙巴当作是刚果政府的官方代表团而给予签证”。
    在这以前，卢蒙巴曾指责美国操纵下的“联合国总部”为了阻挠他去联合国大会陈诉刚果局势的真实情况，拒绝为他提供任何交通工具。
    在这同时，发动武装叛乱企图推翻刚果合法政府的刚果陆军参谋长蒙博托也扬言，如果卢蒙巴要去联合国，就要逮捕他。
