Cameroonian National Hero, Um Nyobè

　　Um Nyobè was the former Secretary-General of the Cameroonian People's Union and one of the organizers and leaders of the Cameroonian People's Guerrilla. He was murdered by French colonialists on September 13, 1958.

　　In order to suppress the increasingly high Cameroonian national independence movement, the French colonialists mobilized a large number of colonial troops to carry out a bloody massacre of the Cameroonian people in 1955, resulting in the "May Massacre" with more than 5,000 casualties. It was from that time that the French colonialists declared the Cameroonian People's Union "illegal". However, the frenzied suppression by imperialism did not stop the continued development of the Cameroonian national independence movement. In the summer of 1956, Um Nyobè led the Cameroonian people in launching an armed struggle in the forests of Snaga-Malidingre, and established the "National Steering Committee" there to carry out military leadership work. In 1957, the armed struggle quickly spread to the Bassa area on the coast of Shanga and the port of Douala, as well as the western region of Cameroon. In 1958, the armed struggle spread to the Bamileke area with a population of 500,000; later, it penetrated into areas such as Mongo and Wouri. The Cameroonian guerrillas controlled a large part of the Bamileke area. At present, under the leadership of the Cameroonian People's Union, the Cameroonian people are still stubbornly adhering to the heroic struggle against the French colonial army. (Hong)

    喀麦隆民族英雄于姆·尼奥勃
    于姆·尼奥勃是前喀麦隆人民联盟总书记和喀麦隆人民游击队的组织者和领导者之一，1958年9月13日被法国殖民者杀害。
    法国殖民者为了镇压日益高涨的喀麦隆民族独立运动，于1955年调集大批殖民军对喀麦隆人民实行了血腥的大屠杀，造成了五千多人死伤的“五月大惨案”。就从那个时候起，法国殖民者宣布了喀麦隆人民联盟为“非法”。但是，帝国主义的疯狂镇压，并没有阻止喀麦隆民族独立运动的继续发展。1956年夏季，于姆·尼奥勃领导了喀麦隆人民在斯纳加·马利丁勒的丛林中开始了武装斗争，并在那里设立了“全国指导委员会”，进行军事领导工作。1957年，武装斗争很快地就在沙纳加海滨和杜阿拉港口的巴萨地区以及喀麦隆西部地区开展起来。1958年武装斗争又蔓延到了拥有五十万人口的巴米累克地区；之后，又深入到蒙戈和武里等地区。喀麦隆游击队控制了巴米累克地区的很大部分。目前，喀麦隆人民在喀麦隆人民联盟的领导下，仍在顽强地坚持着反抗法国殖民军的英勇斗争。（洪）
