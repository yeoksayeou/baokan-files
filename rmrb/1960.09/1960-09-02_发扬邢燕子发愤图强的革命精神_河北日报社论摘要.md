Promote Xing Yanzi's Revolutionary Spirit of Self-Improvement Through Hard Work
Abstract of Hebei Daily Editorial

Under the education and leadership of the Party, heroic figures are constantly emerging on the agricultural production front in our province. They are utterly devoted and hold high the three red banners of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Commune. They work diligently in the countryside, driving the masses to continuously move forward and making outstanding contributions to accelerating the change of our province's "poor and blank" state, becoming role models for people to learn from. Xing Yanzi, the good daughter of the Party, is one of the thousands of heroic figures.

We say that Xing Yanzi is worth learning from, first of all, because she has the revolutionary spirit of self-improvement through hard work. She was unwilling to see her production team always be a poor team, and unwilling to see her hometown's production always lag behind. Therefore, she learned from Wang Guofan's "poor-stick spirit" of running a cooperative diligently and thriftily, determined to turn Beida Depression into a land of fish and rice. Others looked down on her, saying that "a young girl can't do big things," but she insisted on proving herself and resolutely achieving results. Some people said she was a "foolish girl," but she didn't take it seriously, using reason, and even more so, using facts to show that running agriculture well and changing the face of a poor team was not a foolish thing. The "poor-stick spirit" is the spirit of self-improvement through hard work, and self-improvement through hard work is the excellent tradition of the Chinese people. Because of this spirit, Jianming Cooperative quickly changed the face of the mountainous area; because of this spirit, the "Iron Girls Team" quickly made Xiaoyuzhuang catch up with the rich team from a poor team; and also because of this spirit, the Yanzi Commando Team quickly changed the appearance of Sijiazhuang. Wang Guofan, the Iron Girls, and Xing Yanzi are all ambitious people. With ambition, there is strength, and only then can one overturn the world and reverse the situation.

To strive for self-improvement, one must be diligent and thrifty, and one must work hard. Xing Yanzi has also performed very well in this regard, and it is worth learning from. Diligence and thrift are the virtues of the working people of our country. No matter when, we should carry forward this virtue. It is especially needed now. We must be diligent and thrifty in managing our homes, diligent and thrifty in running cooperatives, diligent and thrifty in running factories, and diligent and thrifty in running all undertakings. We must produce as much grain, cotton, etc. as possible, and we must save as much as possible, starting from saving a grain of rice or an inch of cloth, and using all kinds of material forces well in production. In this way, we can gradually go from difficulty to not difficulty, and gradually go from poor to rich. Xing Yanzi led the commune members to work diligently in production and made remarkable achievements in production and disaster relief. After basically overcoming the disasters, she was determined to change the face of the poor team, overcoming the serious difficulties of thin soil in planting "June-September" wheat, and she wanted to grow wheat even on stony ground. In life, she is also a model of hard work and simplicity. When she went to the commune for a meeting, the team gave her one yuan for meals, but she only spent nine cents, and the rest was returned to the team. This all reflects her valuable spirit of hard work and diligence and thrift. Without diligence and thrift, one cannot be called hard work. And if one does not work hard, self-improvement is just empty talk. Self-improvement and hard work mean not only establishing revolutionary ambitions but also handling affairs practically and realistically. When these two are combined, any difficulty can be overcome.

Why is Xing Yanzi able to strive for self-improvement and work hard like this? The most fundamental reason is that she is utterly devoted and listens to the Party's words. Listening to the Party's words must be manifested in concrete actions, and cannot remain on the level of lip service. Xing Yanzi is like this. The Party needs her in the countryside, so she stays in the countryside; the Party needs her to do something, so she does it. Not only does she do it herself, but she also actively helps others so that they can also do well. Building socialism requires a social division of labor. Who goes to work in industry and who goes to work in agriculture should be decided according to the needs of construction. This will ensure the coordinated development of industry and agriculture. If one does not obey the needs of construction and only acts according to personal interests, it will affect national construction. Listening to the Party's words means first of all seeing whether one can obey the needs of construction. At present, when the Party emphasizes strengthening the agricultural front, one should actively engage in agriculture. Listening to the Party's words does not exclude personal ideals. Young people should have their own lofty ideals. But personal ideals can only be considered lofty and can only be realized when they are consistent with the interests of socialist construction. If one is preoccupied with personal gains and losses, avoids difficulties and pursues ease, and picks and chooses, even if one reluctantly obeys the needs of construction, one will not be able to muster the spirit or the energy. People who are dominated by this kind of thinking are bound to accomplish nothing. Before Xing Yanzi made up her mind to stay in the countryside, she was not without some personal ideas, nor was she without ideological struggles. She was able to stay in her hometown when it was hit by a disaster because she listened to the Party's words, combined the interests of socialist construction with her personal interests, and consciously subordinated personal interests to the interests of socialist construction. Listening to the Party's words is also manifested in working hard, giving play to initiative and creativity, and doing the work well. In her work, the Party needed her to be a teacher for the children, and although she did not like this work at first, she still obeyed the assignment because it was the Party's need; when she encountered difficulties in her work, although she was also distressed, she listened to the Party's words and persisted in fighting the difficulties in order to liberate more women to participate in labor, thinking of various ways to complete the task outstandingly.

    发扬邢燕子发愤图强的革命精神
    河北日报社论摘要
    在党的教育和领导下，我省农业生产战线上，不断涌现一些英雄人物，他们忠心耿耿，高举总路线、大跃进、人民公社三面红旗，在农村埋头苦干，带动群众不断前进，为加速改变我省“一穷二白”的面貌，做出了出色的贡献，成为人们学习的榜样。党的好儿女邢燕子，就是成千上万个英雄人物中的一个。
    我们说邢燕子值得学习，首先因为她有着发愤图强的革命精神。她不甘心自己的生产队老是个穷队，不甘心自己的家乡生产总落后，于是就学习王国藩勤俭办社的“穷棒子精神”，决心把北大洼变成鱼米之乡。别人瞧不起她，说什么“黄毛丫头办不了大事”，她硬是要争一口气，坚决做出成绩来。有人说她是“傻丫头”，她硬是不以为然，用道理，更用事实，说明办好农业、改变穷队面貌，并不是傻事。“穷棒子精神”，就是发愤图强的精神，发愤图强，正是我国人民的优良传统。因为有了这种精神，建明社很快改变了山区面貌；因为有了这种精神，
  “铁姑娘队”很快使小于庄由穷队赶上富队；也因为有了这种精神，燕子突击队很快使司家庄变了样。王国藩、铁姑娘、邢燕子，都是有志气的人。有志气，才有力量，才能够翻天覆地，扭转乾坤。
    要发愤图强，必须克勤克俭，必须埋头苦干。邢燕子在这方面也表现得很好，值得人们学习。勤俭是我国劳动人民的美德。不论什么时候，我们都应当发扬这种美德。目前尤其需要。要勤俭持家，勤俭办社，勤俭办厂，勤俭办一切事业。要尽可能多生产粮食、棉花等等，又要尽可能节省，从节省一粒米、一寸布做起，把各种物质力量很好地用到生产上去。这样，才能逐渐由困难到不困难，逐渐由穷变富。邢燕子在生产上带领社员勤勤恳恳，在生产救灾中，作出了显著的成绩，在基本战胜灾荒后，又立志改变穷队面貌，在种“六九”麦中克服了地薄的严重困难，要在石头地上也种出麦子来。在生活上，她也是艰苦朴素的榜样，到公社去开会，队里给了她一元钱的饭费，她只花了九分钱，其余的又交给队里。这都反映了她埋头苦干、克勤克俭的可贵精神。不勤不俭，就不能叫什么埋头苦干。而如果不埋头苦干，发愤图强就是一句空话。发愤图强，埋头苦干，这就是既要立革命的雄心大志，又要踏踏实实、实事求是地办事情。这二者结合起来，什么困难也可以克服。
    邢燕子为什么能够这样发愤图强、埋头苦干？最根本的原因，是她忠心耿耿，听党的话。听党的话，要表现在具体行动上，不能停留在口头上。邢燕子就是这样的。党需要她在农村，她就在农村，党需要她干什么，她就干什么。不光自己干，还主动地帮助别人，使别人也干得出色。建设社会主义，要有社会分工，谁去搞工业，谁去搞农业，都要根据建设的需要来决定。这样才能保证工、农业的协调发展。如果不服从建设的需要，单按个人的志趣办事，就会影响国家建设。听党的话，首先就看能不能服从建设的需要。在目前，党强调加强农业战线的时候，就应该积极地从事农业。听党的话，并不排斥个人的理想。青年人应该有自己的远大理想。但是个人理想只有和社会主义建设的利益一致起来，才够得上远大，也才能够实现。如果斤斤计较个人得失，排难趋易，挑肥拣瘦，即使勉强服从了建设的需要，也会提不起精神，鼓不起劲。受这种思想支配的人，必然是一事无成。邢燕子下决心留在农村以前，并不是没有一点个人想法的，也不是没有思想斗争的。她能在家乡受灾时留下来，是因为她听党的话，把社会主义建设的利益与个人的利益结合了起来，自觉地把个人利益服从社会主义建设的利益。听党的话，也表现在努力工作，发挥积极性与创造性上，把工作做得出色。邢燕子在工作中，党需要她当教养员，她虽然开始时并不喜欢这个工作，但因为是党的需要，仍然服从分配；在工作中遇见困难，虽然也苦恼过，但她听党的话，为了解放更多的妇女参加劳动，就坚持和困难作斗争，想各种办法，出色地完成了这个任务。
