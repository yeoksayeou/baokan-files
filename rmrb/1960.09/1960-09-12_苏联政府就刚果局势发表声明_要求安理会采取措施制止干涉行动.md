Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, September 9th: The Soviet government, in a statement, indicated that it has instructed the Soviet representative to the United Nations Security Council to firmly demand an immediate convening of the Security Council meeting in order to take measures to immediately stop intervention in any form in the internal affairs of the Congo.

In the statement regarding the situation in the Congo, the Soviet government pointed out that the armed forces under the command of the United Nations Command must withdraw from all the Congolese airfields they now occupy, and return the Congo's own radio station to the Congolese government for its full control. The command headquarters that dispatched troops to the Congo based on Security Council decisions but did not use them in accordance with its mission must be abolished. The statement emphasized, "The legitimate government of the Republic of the Congo should be able to exercise power and authority throughout the Congo without any interference or obstruction from the United Nations representatives."

The Soviet government stressed that if "the Security Council, for some reason, is unable to fulfill its responsibilities, then countries that respect the Security Council's resolution on assistance to the Congo should provide the government of the Republic of the Congo with full support at this difficult moment for the Congolese people."

The Soviet government pointed out that the colonialists' conspiracy against the independence and integrity of the Republic of the Congo, against the Congolese people and the legitimate government of the Congo, is "becoming increasingly dangerous."

The statement also pointed out: "The Belgian colonialists, colluding with their allies in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, primarily the United States, and with the command headquarters of the troops sent to the Congo in accordance with the Security Council's decision, are attempting to stifle the freedom of the Congolese people."

The Soviet government stated in the statement that the imperialist countries are using traitors to the Congolese people, such as Tshombe and Kalonji, to implement a policy of inciting civil war in the Congo. The Soviet government believes that the United Nations Command in the Congo and Secretary-General Hammarskjöld are constantly undermining the United Nations decisions regarding the use of United Nations troops "only after notifying the Congolese government and obtaining its consent." The statement said, "The United Nations representatives in the Congo have not only failed to help the Congolese government restore order and normalize domestic life, but have also tried every possible means to obstruct it."

In the statement, the Soviet government listed facts about how the United Nations representatives in the Congo acted "with the air of colonialists." The Soviet government stated that the countries of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, primarily the United States, along with the United Nations Command, are "openly attempting to undermine the reputation of the government of the Republic of the Congo led by Prime Minister Lumumba."

The statement pointed out that in reality, a colonialist alliance has been formed with the aim of using African soldiers—from Tunisia, Morocco, Ethiopia, and Ghana—to deal with the young African country, the Republic of the Congo.

The Soviet government's statement said that within the United Nations' overall machinery, its head—Secretary-General Hammarskjöld—is "the part that most openly serves the colonialists," "thus tarnishing the reputation of the United Nations in the eyes of the people."

    苏联政府就刚果局势发表声明
    要求安理会采取措施制止干涉行动
    新华社10日讯　塔斯社莫斯科9日讯：苏联政府在一项声明中指出，它已指示驻联合国安全理事会的苏联代表坚决要求立即召开安理会会议，以便采取措施立即制止用任何形式干涉刚果内政。
    苏联政府在关于刚果局势的声明中指出，联合国司令部所指挥的武装部队，必须从他们现在所占据的所有刚果飞机场撤退，并把刚果自己的电台归还给刚果政府，由它全权支配，必须撤销没有按照使命使用根据安理会决定而派往刚果的军队的司令部。声明强调说：“刚果共和国的合法政府应当有可能在刚果全境行使权力和政权，而不受联合国代表的任何干涉或阻挠。”
    苏联政府强调指出，如果“安理会由于某种理由而没有能力履行自己的职责，那么，尊重安理会关于援助刚果的决议的国家，应当在这个对刚果人民困难的时刻给予刚果共和国政府以全力的支持”。
  　苏联政府指出，殖民主义者阴谋反对刚果共和国的独立和完整，反对刚果人民和刚果的合法政府，这种阴谋“越来越具有危险的性质”。
    声明还指出：“比利时殖民主义者同他们的北大西洋公约组织的盟国，首先是美国，同根据安理会的决定派往刚果的军队的司令部串通一气，企图扼杀刚果人民的自由。”
    苏联政府在声明中指出，帝国主义国家利用冲伯和卡隆吉这类刚果人民的叛徒，执行挑起刚果内战的政策。苏联政府认定，联合国驻刚果的司令部和哈马舍尔德秘书长不断地破坏联合国作出的、关于“只有在通知刚果政府并得到它的同意后”才能使用联合国军队的决定。声明说：“联合国在刚果的代表不仅没有帮助、反而千方百计地阻挠刚果政府恢复秩序和使国内生活正常化。”
    苏联政府在声明中列举了哈马舍尔德在刚果的代表“拿出殖民主义者派头”行事的事实。苏联政府声明，北大西洋公约组织的国家，首先是美国，同联合国司令部一道“公开企图破坏卢蒙巴总理领导的刚果共和国政府的声誉”。
    声明指出，实际上形成了一个殖民主义者的联盟，这个联盟的目的是要假非洲人——突尼斯、摩洛哥、埃塞俄比亚、加纳的士兵——之手来对付年轻的非洲国家刚果共和国。
    苏联政府的声明说，在联合国的总机器中，它的首脑——哈马舍尔德秘书长——是“最公开地为殖民主义者服务”的一个部分，“这样就是在人民的心目中糟塌联合国的声誉”。
