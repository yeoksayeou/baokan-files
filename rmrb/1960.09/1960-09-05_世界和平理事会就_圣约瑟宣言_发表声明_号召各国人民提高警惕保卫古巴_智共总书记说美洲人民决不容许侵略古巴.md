Xinhua News Agency, London, September 2nd—The Presidium Office of the World Peace Council today issued a statement regarding the declaration on intervention in Cuba's internal affairs passed by the Organization of American States Foreign Ministers' Meeting in San José under the coercion and enticement of the United States. The statement pointed out that "The World Peace Council notes with unease the threat to Cuba's security, the violation of the independence and sovereignty of Latin American countries, and the threat to world peace contained in the declaration passed at the Organization of American States Foreign Ministers' Meeting held in San José."

The statement pointed out that the wording of the document passed at the San José meeting exposes the true intention of its authors, namely, "to maintain the U.S. government's absolute dominance over Latin American countries in economic and other aspects. This document confirms that the Organization of American States has acted as a tool of U.S. imperialism."

The statement pointed out: Defending the peace and security of Latin America depends on full respect for national sovereignty and the right of all countries to freely decide to establish friendly cooperative relations between their peoples. The statement said that the San José meeting declaration violates the wishes of the peoples of Latin American countries. In reality, this document is nothing more than a mask aimed at justifying interference in the internal affairs of the peoples of Latin American countries, a pre-emptive cover for all aggression.

The statement said, "The World Peace Council believes that this declaration passed at the recent Foreign Ministers' Meeting in San José will be rejected by the peoples of Latin American countries. It will be condemned by world opinion.

Peoples of all countries who are fighting to consolidate their national sovereignty and strive for peaceful coexistence between countries with different political and economic systems will never be intimidated by the threats contained in this declaration."

The World Peace Council calls on "the people of all countries to strengthen vigilance in defending Cuba, and to strengthen activities in defending national sovereignty and independence, and defending peace."

Xinhua News Agency, Santiago, September 1st—General Secretary of the Chilean Communist Party, Corvalán, today made a statement to "Siglo" regarding the Organization of American States Foreign Ministers' Meeting's resolution to interfere in Cuba, saying that the Latin American people support Cuba's cause, and the United States did not achieve the victory it expected at the San José meeting.

Corvalán pointed out, "True history is being written in Havana and in all the rural areas and cities of the Americas, and the people of the Americas will never allow aggression against Fidel Castro's great motherland."

He condemned the United States for using six hundred million dollars in "aid" to induce the foreign ministers of Latin American countries to pass the resolutions orchestrated by the United States at the meeting. He said that the resolutions of the Foreign Ministers' Meeting make Latin American countries even more subservient to U.S. directives.

Speaking of the so-called "interference from outside the continent" raised by the United States, Corvalán said that the only interference in Latin America is U.S. interference, and the only thing Latin American countries should do is oppose this interference and support Cuba.

Xinhua News Agency, Santiago, September 3rd—Chilean public opinion supports the "Havana Declaration" passed at the Cuban People's National Assembly on the 2nd.

Chile's "Siglo" wrote in a commentary on the 3rd: "The Cuban revolution will advance more resolutely because, in the face of despicable threats, the exemplary and courageous Cuban people, as well as all the peoples of the Americas who stand with it, will further strengthen their strength to defend the Cuban revolution." The commentary criticized the Chilean government for signing the "heinous declaration" in San José. It said that the Chilean people will stand at the forefront in supporting the struggle of the Cuban people.

An editorial published by "Ultima Hora" stated, "It can be considered that the 'Havana Declaration' is Latin America's solemn response to the shameful 'San José Declaration.'" It said that this declaration "should receive the active support of all people's organizations and every progressive person on the continent."

    世界和平理事会就“圣约瑟宣言”发表声明
    号召各国人民提高警惕保卫古巴
    智共总书记说美洲人民决不容许侵略古巴
    新华社伦敦2日电　世界和平理事会主席团主席办公处今天就圣约瑟美洲国家组织外长会议在美国胁迫和利诱下通过的干涉古巴内部事务的宣言发表声明指出，“世界和平理事会不安地注意到对古巴安全的威胁，对拉丁美洲国家独立和主权的侵犯，以及在圣约瑟举行的美洲国家组织外长会议所通过的宣言中所包含的对世界和平的威胁。”
    声明指出，圣约瑟会议通过的文件的措词，暴露了文件作者的真正意图，即“希望保持美国政府对拉丁美洲国家在经济和其它方面的绝对统治。这个文件证实，美洲国家组织充当了美帝国主义的工具的角色”。
    声明指出：保卫拉丁美洲的和平和安全取决于对国家主权的完全尊重和各国自由决定建立各国人民之间的友好合作联系的权利。声明说，圣约瑟会议的宣言违反了拉丁美洲各国人民的愿望。实际上，这个文件只不过是旨在为干涉拉丁美洲各国人民内部事务辩护的假面具，是对一切侵略的事先的掩饰。
    声明说，“世界和平理事会相信，最近在圣约瑟举行的外长会议所通过的这一宣言将遭到拉丁美洲各国人民的否认。它将遭到全世界舆论的谴责。
    正在为巩固自己的国家主权，争取和平和不同政治、经济制度国家的和平共处而奋斗的各国人民，决不会被这一宣言中所包含的威胁吓倒。”
    世界和平理事会号召“各国人民在保卫古巴方面加强警惕，加强保卫国家主权和独立以及保卫和平的活动”。
    据新华社圣地亚哥1日电　智利共产党总书记科尔巴兰今天就美洲国家组织外长会议干涉古巴的决议对“世纪报”发表谈话说，拉丁美洲人民支持古巴的事业，美国并没有在圣约瑟会议上取得它所期望的胜利。
    科尔巴兰指出，“在哈瓦那和美洲的一切农村和城市，写着真正的历史，美洲的人民决不容许侵略菲德尔·卡斯特罗的伟大祖国。”
    他谴责美国用六亿美元的“援助”来诱使拉丁美洲国家的外长们在会上通过美国策划的决议。他说，外长会议的决议使拉丁美洲国家更加屈从于美国的指令。
    在谈到美国提出的所谓“来自大陆以外的干涉”时，科尔巴兰说，对拉丁美洲的唯一干涉是美国的干涉，拉丁美洲国家唯一应该做的事情是反对这个干涉和支援古巴。
    据新华社圣地亚哥3日电　智利舆论支持2日在古巴人民全国大会上通过的“哈瓦那宣言”。
    智利“世纪报”3日在一篇评论中写道：“古巴革命将更加坚决地前进，因为在卑鄙的威胁面前，作为典范的勇敢的古巴人民，以及同它站在一起的全体美洲人民，将为保卫古巴革命而进一步加强自己的力量。”评论指责智利政府在圣约瑟的“万恶宣言”上签字。它说，智利人民将站在支持古巴人民的斗争的最前列。
    “最后一点钟报”发表的社论说，“可以认为‘哈瓦那宣言’是拉丁美洲对可耻的‘圣约瑟宣言’的严正的回答。”它说，这项宣言“应该得到大陆所有人民团体和每一位进步人士的积极支持”。（附图片）
