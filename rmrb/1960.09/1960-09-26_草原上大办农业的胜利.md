    The Victory of Vigorously Developing Agriculture on the Grasslands
　　First Secretary of the CPC Xilin Gol League Committee　Gao Wanbao Zhabu
    Under the guidance of the thought that agriculture is the foundation, more than 500,000 farmers and herdsmen in Xilin Gol League have been working hard and striving for progress, launching a mass movement to reclaim land for cultivation, vigorously develop agriculture, and vigorously develop grain production on the vast grasslands. The total sown area in the league has increased from 3.34 million mu to 5.1 million mu in one year, an increase of 52.7%. In particular, in the purely pastoral areas, where there was almost no agriculture before, and where the land is vast and sparsely populated, livestock are numerous, and labor is scarce, the sown area of ​​grain and feed crops this year reached 1.63 million mu, an expansion of 4.6 times compared with last year, and a bumper harvest has been achieved, realizing self-sufficiency in grain in pastoral areas. It can also take out part of the grain and oil to support national construction, changing the historical face of pastoral areas that do not produce grain.
    Xilin Gol League is located in the central part of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region and is a place mainly based on animal husbandry. The total area of ​​the league is about 237,000 square kilometers, of which about 190,000 square kilometers are the so-called pure pastoral areas in the past. This vast pastoral area is not only rich in water and grass, extremely suitable for the development of animal husbandry, but also has fertile land and abundant water resources in many places, with a frost-free period of about 110 to 120 days, which is suitable for the development of agriculture.
    But until before 1956, there was almost no agriculture in pastoral areas. Before liberation, laboring herdsmen suffered cruel exploitation by feudal princes, Japanese imperialism, Kuomintang reactionaries, and Mongolian traitorous merchants in order to eat a little grain, and suffered all the pain of long-distance travel. After liberation, the laboring herdsmen turned over, and with the development of production, animal husbandry and the lives of herdsmen in pastoral areas have been greatly improved. However, the grain for more than 100,000 people and the feed needed for millions of livestock in pastoral areas still need to be transported and supplied by the state from thousands of miles away. It takes a lot of manpower and material resources to transport grain every year. In particular, because there is no agriculture in pastoral areas, agriculture and animal husbandry cannot be closely integrated, so that animal husbandry cannot completely solve the problem of feed and forage, and cannot completely overcome wind and snow disasters. The vast number of herdsmen urgently demand to change this situation.
    According to the policy of combining agriculture and animal husbandry instructed by the Central Committee and the Autonomous Region Party Committee, the CPC Xilin Gol League Committee began in 1956 to call on and organize some mutual aid groups, cooperatives, and state-owned ranches in pastoral areas to try to run agriculture. After four years of experimentation, it has been proven that the grasslands in pastoral areas can not only grow wheat, naked oats, barley, and millet, sorghum, millet, and other grain crops, but also can grow rape, flax, sugar beet, and other oil crops, cash crops, and various melons and vegetables. Since 1958, the implementation of the General Line and the realization of the Great Leap Forward and people's communes have greatly liberated the productive forces and people's thinking, creating extremely favorable conditions for vigorously developing agriculture in agricultural and pastoral areas. At the same time, the stable, comprehensive, and high-speed development of animal husbandry, as well as the development of industrial and mining construction, require a large amount of grain and feed, and all parties are more eager to develop agriculture. Under this situation, this spring, under the guidance of the thought that the national economy must take agriculture as its foundation, the CPC Xilin Gol League Committee summarized the experience of running agriculture on a trial basis in pastoral areas for several years, and led and mobilized the people in pastoral areas to launch a mass movement to vigorously develop agriculture and vigorously develop grain production. After establishing the idea of taking agriculture as the foundation, the cadres and the broad masses in pastoral areas carried forward the spirit of hard struggle and striving for progress in vigorously developing agriculture, and thus achieved great results. In the vast and sparsely populated pastoral areas, reclaiming and cultivating land on a large scale at the speed of the Great Leap Forward has caused a series of new changes on the grasslands and promoted the faster development of various undertakings. First of all, vigorously developing agriculture provides sufficient grain and feed for people and livestock in pastoral areas on the spot, which lays the foundation for the stable, comprehensive, and high-speed development of animal husbandry. Secondly, it accelerates the formation of settlement points in pastoral areas, which is of great significance for changing the historical face of pastoral areas. With the establishment of state-owned farms and the operation of agriculture by the three levels (state-owned agricultural and pastoral farms, communes, and production brigades), some farmers were moved in, and some herdsmen participated in agricultural production on a fixed and temporary basis, and many new settlements appeared near the farmland. Third, vigorously developing agriculture has promoted the development of diversified operations by pastoral communes. With the vigorous development of agriculture and the increase in farmers, pig raising, vegetable growing, poultry raising, fish farming, and other sideline production have also greatly increased. This year, pastoral areas raised more than 14,000 pigs, grew more than 60,000 mu of vegetables, raised more than 30,000 poultry, and other sideline income also increased greatly; small agricultural and pastoral machinery repair and assembly plants and grain processing plants run by communes have all undergone new development. Fourth, vigorously developing agriculture has enabled the rational utilization of land, water resources, and fertilizers in pastoral areas. There is a large amount of arable land in the pastoral areas of the league, part of which will be gradually reclaimed; the manure of more than 4 million livestock will be fully utilized with the development of agriculture; the water resources of the pastoral areas will also be comprehensively utilized to serve agriculture and animal husbandry. Fifth, due to the great development of agriculture in pastoral areas, it not only provides grain and raw materials for industry, but also requires local industry to serve agriculture and animal husbandry, produce and repair more agricultural and pastoral machinery, and supply more production and living goods, which will inevitably promote the development of industry. Sixth, vigorously developing agriculture has further enhanced national unity and Mongolian-Han cultural exchanges. With the development of agriculture, more than 30,000 herdsmen in the league have participated in agricultural production activities and gradually learned agricultural knowledge and technology; while Han farmers have also begun to learn animal husbandry. Mongolian and Han farmers and herdsmen work together, interact frequently, care for each other, and take care of each other, and the relationship is extremely harmonious. Mongolian herdsmen support farmers with yurts and fur clothing, and send meat and dairy food; while farmers enthusiastically help herdsmen learn agricultural technology, build houses, and dig wells. Herdsmen ask farmer brothers to stay in pastoral areas for a long time and jointly build a happy grassland; farmers have expressed their willingness to settle down in pastoral areas. In short, the results of vigorously developing agriculture over the past year have made the people of our league further realize that vigorously developing agriculture in pastoral areas makes the combination of agriculture and animal husbandry more direct and closer, which will make various undertakings in pastoral areas prosper and develop more rapidly, and make animal husbandry and other undertakings realize modernization faster, which will further promote the unity of all nationalities, especially the Mongolian and Han nationalities, thereby accelerating the elimination of the historical economic inequality between the various nationalities, accelerating the change of the poor and blank face of pastoral areas, and enabling the minority nationalities in pastoral areas to enter the ranks of advanced nationalities as soon as possible.
    Over the past year, our main experiences in vigorously developing agriculture in pastoral areas are:
    First, carrying out the struggle between the two lines deeply and continuously, and overcoming conservative thinking, is one of the keys to achieving a great leap forward in agriculture in pastoral areas. The vast number of cadres and herdsmen support the vigorous development of agriculture in pastoral areas, but some people overestimate the difficulties too much and want to do it slowly. Therefore, it is necessary to vigorously mobilize the masses, strengthen the leadership of the Party, strengthen ideological education, improve everyone's understanding of vigorously developing agriculture in pastoral areas, and rely on the wisdom and strength of the broad masses to specifically solve some practical difficulties in the work.
    Second, running agriculture at three levels and running agriculture in all walks of life is an important method for pastoral areas to run agriculture in a more, faster, better, and more economical way. This year, the pastoral areas have sown 1.63 million mu, of which state-owned agricultural and pastoral farms account for 38%, and people's communes and brigades account for 62%. For example, in the arable land area of pastoral areas, a total of 1.59 million mu were reclaimed this year, and organs, schools, enterprises, and troops accounted for 7.8%. These facts fully demonstrate that running agriculture at three levels and running agriculture in all walks of life can fully mobilize the enthusiasm of the broad masses, mobilize all positive factors, and enable pastoral areas to reclaim and cultivate land in a more, faster, better, and more economical way.
    Third, we have conscientiously implemented the policy of "taking soil as the main thing and combining local and foreign methods," and adopted the "three-combination" method of combining large, medium, and small sizes, combining large areas with scattered small plots, and combining professional reclamation teams, year-round reclamation teams, and mass shock reclamation, which is the correct method for pastoral areas to run agriculture in a more, faster, better, and more economical way under the current conditions.
    Fourth, strengthen the specific leadership of the Party and vigorously launch mass movements. This year, according to the policy of "taking animal husbandry as the focus and agriculture as the foundation," the League Committee formulated a series of specific policies. Party committees at all levels rationally planned farmland and pastures, and the League, Banner, and Communes also established feed production offices at different levels. The first secretaries of Party committees at all levels personally took command, went deep into the grassroots, dispatched a large number of agricultural cadres, strengthened the leadership at the grassroots, vigorously mobilized the masses, and tried every means to overcome difficulties, thereby ensuring continuous leap forward. Under the leadership of the Party, the broad masses of farmers and herdsmen demonstrated soaring revolutionary drive and tenacious will to strive for progress in the mass movement of vigorously developing agriculture and vigorously developing grain production. During the spring reclamation, in order to overcome the difficulty of insufficient plows, state-owned farms and people's communes widely adopted the method of "resting people and resting cattle but not resting plows" and the double-shift and three-shift operation method, which made the daily progress of a double-铧 plow for reclamation leap from eight mu to fifteen mu, and some exceeded twenty mu, and many farmers and herdsmen reclaimed land at night with lanterns. When seeds were lacking, herdsmen rode horses to agricultural areas hundreds of miles away to transport them; when there was a shortage of hemp locally, herdsmen cut reeds to make rope sets. Some herdsmen took out their beloved horses and castrated oxen to support agriculture.
    Fifth, "the whole Party and the whole people take action, and all walks of life provide support" is the guarantee for vigorously developing agriculture in pastoral areas. According to incomplete statistics, this year the league's commercial departments supplied more than 4,200 sets of agricultural machinery, and industry processed, cast, and repaired more than 190,000 pieces (sets) of various machinery for agriculture and animal husbandry. The grain department allocated more than 2,000 tons of seeds; the transportation department rushed to transport day and night, with cars, horse-drawn carts, ox carts, and camels all mobilized; the health department sent doctors to the fields for treatment. In particular, fraternal regions have given us strong support in terms of manpower and materials, which has played a great role in completing our reclamation and sowing tasks.
    The victory of vigorously developing agriculture in pastoral areas in our league is the victory of the thought of "agriculture is the foundation of the national economy" put forward by the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, the victory of the Party's General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Communes, the victory of the Party's national policy, and also the inevitable result of the vast number of herdsmen's urgent demand to change the backward face of pastoral areas under the leadership of the Party. Now, the people of the league are summing up experience, overcoming shortcomings, and advancing victoriously, striving to achieve a greater leap forward in agriculture in pastoral areas in 1961!

    草原上大办农业的胜利
　　中共锡林郭勒盟委员会第一书记　高万宝扎布
    在农业为基础的思想指导下，锡林郭勒盟五十多万农民和牧民发愤图强，在千里草原上，开展了垦荒种地，大办农业，大办粮食的群众运动。全盟一年播种面积由三百三十四万亩增加到五百一十万亩，增长52.7％。特别是原来几乎没有农业的纯牧区，在地广人稀、牲畜多、劳力少的情况下，今年粮食饲料播种面积达一百六十三万亩，比去年扩大了四点六倍，并获得了大丰收，实现了牧区粮食自给自足，还可以拿出一部分粮食和油料支援国家建设，改变了牧区不产粮食的历史面貌。
    锡林郭勒盟位于内蒙古自治区中部，是以牧业为主的地方。全盟面积约二十三万七千平方公里，其中约十九万平方公里是过去所说的纯牧区。这片辽阔的牧区，不仅水草丰美，极宜发展畜牧业，而且许多地方土地肥沃，水源不缺，无霜期在一百一十天到一百二十天左右，适宜发展农业。
    但直到1956年以前，牧区几乎没有农业。解放前，劳动牧民为了吃点粮食，受尽了封建王公、日本帝国主义和国民党反动派以及旅蒙奸商的残酷剥削，吃尽了长途赶脚的痛苦。解放后，劳动牧民翻了身，随着生产的发展，牧区畜牧业和牧民生活都有了极大的提高和改善。但牧区十多万人的口粮和几百万头牲畜所需的饲料，仍需要国家从千里以外运入供应。每年运粮需要花费大量的人力物力。特别是由于牧区没有农业，农牧业不能密切结合，使畜牧业不能彻底解决饲料、饲草问题，不能完全战胜风雪灾害。广大牧民迫切要求改变这种局面。
    中共锡林郭勒盟委员会根据中央和自治区党委指示的农牧结合的方针，从1956年开始，号召和组织牧区部分互助组、合作社和国营牧场试办农业。经过四年的试验，证明牧区草原不仅可以生长小麦、莜麦、大麦和糜、谷、黍等粮食作物，而且可以生长油菜、线麻、甜菜等油料、经济作物和多种瓜菜。1958年以来，总路线的贯彻，大跃进和人民公社化的实现，大大解放了生产力和人们的思想，为农牧区大办农业创造了极有利的条件；同时，畜牧业的稳定、全面、高速度的发展以及工矿建设的开展，都需要大量粮食和饲料，各方面对办农业的要求更加迫切了。在这种形势下，今年春天，中共锡林郭勒盟委员会在国民经济必须以农业为基础的思想指导下，总结了牧区几年来试办农业的经验，领导和发动牧区人民展开了大办农业、大办粮食的群众运动。牧区干部和广大群众在树立了以农业为基础的思想以后，在大办农业中发扬了艰苦奋斗、发愤图强的精神，因而取得了很大成绩。在地广人稀的牧区，以大跃进的速度，大面积地开荒种地，引起了草原上一系列的新变化，促进着各项事业更快地发展。首先，大办农业，为牧区人畜就地提供了充足的粮食和饲料，这就为畜牧业稳定、全面、高速度地发展打下了基础。其次，加速了牧区定居点的形成，这对改变牧区历史面貌具有重大意义。随着国营农场的建立和三级（国营农牧场、公社、生产大队）办农业，移入部分农民，一部分牧民固定地和临时地参加了农业生产，农田附近出现了许多新的定居点。第三，大办农业促进了牧区公社开展多种经营。随着大办农业和农民的增加，养猪种菜、饲养家禽、养鱼和其他副业生产也大大增加。今年牧区养猪一万四千多头，种菜六万多亩，饲养家禽三万多只，其他副业收入也有很大增长；社办的小型农牧机具修配厂、粮食加工厂等都有新的发展。第四，大搞农业，使牧区土地、水利资源、肥料等得到了合理利用。全盟牧区有大量可耕土地，其中一部分将逐渐被开垦；四百多万头牲畜的粪肥，随着农业的发展，会被充分地利用起来；牧区的水利资源也将综合利用，为农、牧业服务。第五，由于牧区农业大发展，不仅为工业提供着粮食和原料，而且要求地方工业为农牧业服务，生产和修理更多的农牧业机具，供应更多的生产、生活用品，这就必然促进工业的发展。第六，大办农业更进一步增进了民族团结和蒙汉族文化交流。随着农业发展，全盟有三万多牧民参加了农业生产活动，逐渐学到农业知识和技术；而汉族农民也开始学牧业。蒙汉族农牧民，共同劳动，经常接触，互相关怀，互相照顾，关系极为融洽。蒙古族牧民支援农民蒙古包和皮衣，送肉、送奶食；而农民则热情地帮助牧民学习农业技术、盖房子、打井。牧民们要求农民兄弟长期留在牧区，共同建设幸福的草原；农民都表示愿在牧区安家落户。总之，一年来大办农业的结果，使我们全盟人民进一步认识到：牧区大办农业，使农牧结合更直接、更紧密，这将使牧区各项事业更加迅速地得到繁荣和发展，使牧业和其他各项事业更快地实现现代化，将进一步促进各民族特别是蒙汉民族的团结，从而加速消除历史上遗留下来的各民族间在经济上的不平等状态，加速改变牧区一穷二白的面貌，使牧区的少数民族早日走进先进民族的行列。
    一年来，我们在牧区大办农业的主要体会是：
    第一，深入地、不断地开展两条路线的斗争，克服保守思想，是取得牧区农业大跃进的关键之一。牧区大办农业，广大干部和牧民是拥护的，但是有些人过多地估计了困难，想慢慢地来。因此，必须大力发动群众，加强党的领导，加强思想教育，提高大家对于牧区大办农业的认识，依靠广大群众的智慧和力量，具体解决工作中的一些实际困难。
    第二，三级办农业，各行各业办农业，是牧区办农业多快好省的重要方法。今年牧区播种一百六十三万亩，其中国营农牧场占38％，人民公社和大队占62％。又如牧区耕地面积中，今年共垦荒一百五十九万亩，机关、学校、企业、部队就占7.8％。这些事实充分说明：三级办农业，各行各业办农业，可以充分发挥广大群众积极性，调动一切积极因素，使牧区开荒种地做到多快好省。
    第三，我们认真贯彻了“以土为主，土洋结合”的方针，根据大中小相结合、大面积与零星小块相结合的原则，采取了专业开荒队、常年开荒队与群众性突击开荒相结合的“三结合”办法，这是目前条件下，牧区多快好省的办农业的正确方法。
    第四，加强党的具体领导，大搞群众运动。今年，盟委根据“以牧业为重点，以农业为基础”的方针，规定了一系列具体政策，各级党委都合理地规划了农田、牧场，盟、旗、公社还分级成立了饲料生产办公室，各级党委第一书记亲自挂帅，深入基层，调派大批农业干部，加强了基层领导，大力发动群众，千方百计克服困难，从而保证了不断跃进。在党的领导下，广大农牧民在大办农业、大办粮食的群众运动中，表现了冲天的革命干劲和发愤图强的顽强意志。春季开荒时，为了克服犁犋不足的困难，国营农场和人民公社，广泛采用了歇人歇牛不歇犁的办法和双班、三班作业法，使一台双铧犁开荒日进度由八亩跃进到十五亩，有的超过二十亩，许多农牧民夜间提灯开荒。当种籽缺乏时，牧民就骑马到几百里外的农业区驮运；当地缺麻，牧民们就割芨芨草作绳套。有的牧民为了支援农业，拿出心爱的骑马和犍牛开荒。
    第五，“全党全民动手，各行各业支援”是牧区大办农业的保证。据不完全统计：今年全盟商业部门供应农业机械四千二百多台，工业为农牧业加工铸造修配各种机具十九万多件
  （台）。粮食部门调拨了二千多吨种子；运输部门昼夜赶运，汽车、马车、牛车、骆驼一齐出动；卫生部门派医生深入田间治疗。特别是兄弟地区在人力、物力上给了我们大力支援，对我们完成开荒和播种任务起了很大作用。
    我盟牧区大办农业的胜利，是党中央和毛主席提出的“农业是国民经济基础”的思想的胜利，是党的总路线、大跃进、人民公社的胜利，是党的民族政策的胜利，也是广大牧民在党的领导下迫切要求改变牧区落后面貌的必然结果。现在，全盟人民正在总结经验，克服缺点，乘胜前进，为争取1961年实现牧区农业更大跃进而奋斗！
