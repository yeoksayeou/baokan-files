Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 23rd - According to a broadcast today by the Laotian Combat Forces Radio, Prince Souphanouvong, Chairman of the Central Committee of the Lao Patriotic Front, has once again sent a letter to the two chairmen of the 1954 Geneva Conference on Indochina, requesting them to help immediately stop the interference in Laos' internal affairs by the American imperialists and their lackeys in the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization's aggressive bloc.

    The letter, issued on September 21, also requested that the International Commission for Supervision and Control in Laos resume its activities and reconvene the Geneva Conference in order to ensure the implementation of the Geneva Agreements on Laos.

    The letter enumerated the recent actions of the United States and Thailand in interfering with and invading Laos. The letter stated that these actions show that the American aggressive bloc and its running dogs in Southeast Asia have been and are continuing to openly assist the Phoumi Nosavan rebel group in realizing their plan to attack Vientiane and oppose the government. They have, in fact, completely disregarded the provisions of the Geneva Agreements, disregarded the independence, sovereignty, and legitimate aspirations of our country and our people, and carried out armed interference in Laos. This is in order to turn Laos into a new type of colony and a military aggression base for the United States. It is clear that these actions will cause disputes that threaten not only Laos, but also the entire Indochina and Southeast Asia.

    Prince Souphanouvong therefore made three demands to the two chairmen of the Geneva Conference:

    "(1) With the power and qualifications of the chairmen of the Geneva Conference on Indochina, demand that the American warmongers and the reactionary forces of the Southeast Asia group immediately cease all interference in Laos, and first and foremost stop instigating and supporting the Phoumi Nosavan rebel group's armed rebellion against the Royal Lao Government.

      (2) Within a certain period of time, find a way to restore the activities of the International Commission for Supervision and Control in Laos in order to stop the interference actions of the American aggressive bloc and its running dogs in Southeast Asia.

      (3) Find a way to convene an extraordinary meeting of the participating countries of the Geneva Conference to condemn the crimes of the aggressors and seek appropriate measures to stop the interference activities of the American aggressive bloc and ensure the thorough implementation of the Geneva Agreements on Laos."

    Prince Souphanouvong recalled that in his letter to the two chairmen on September 16, he had reminded them of the close collusion between the American imperialist aggressors, Thailand, and the reactionary group in South Vietnam, and the coordinated actions in openly opposing the Royal Lao Government with the Phoumi Nosavan group. Souphanouvong said that the Lao people have risen up to resolutely oppose aggression. The Royal Lao Government has also repeatedly and strongly opposed this blatant interference. However, the American aggressors, Thailand, and the reactionary group in South Vietnam have not only not stopped these activities, but on the contrary, have intensified their aggression against our country in recent days. Prince Souphanouvong cited specific examples of this aggression, including: (1) For four consecutive days, from September 16 to 19, the Thai government allowed the reactionary army of Phoumi Nosavan, which was mixed with Thais, to fire from Thai bases at targets on Lao territory and at the peaceful residents of Vientiane.

    (2) On September 18, the General Headquarters of the Thai Army ordered the local authorities in Nong Khai Province and the Chanpho and Si Chiang Mai areas opposite Vientiane to prohibit people from traveling on the highways, which were only allowed to be used to transport troops and military supplies.

      (3) On the same day, at the instigation of the American aggressive bloc, Vong Na Champassak, chairman of the "Revolutionary Committee," called on the Southeast Asia aggressive bloc to carry out armed intervention to oppose the legitimate government of Laos and the Lao people. Subsequently, the Thai Foreign Ministry immediately announced that it would immediately "consider the above-mentioned appeal," and on September 21, it formally announced its decision to recommend that the Southeast Asia military bloc carry out armed intervention in Laos.

      (4) On September 21, Thai aircraft taking off from Thai bases supplied heavy weapons to Phoumi Nosavan's troops in Bassan (one hundred and fifty kilometers downstream of Vientiane).

    Prince Souphanouvong said, "For the sake of peace in Laos, Indochina, and Southeast Asia, we hope that the two chairmen, who bear great responsibility for this, will respond fairly and resolutely to the earnest appeal that we are once again sending to you at these particularly serious moments that our country is experiencing."

### 苏发努冯致函日内瓦会议两位主席　要求制止美国及其仆从的干涉行动　揭露美国支持诺萨万集团企图把老挝变成军事侵略基地

    苏发努冯致函日内瓦会议两位主席
　　要求制止美国及其仆从的干涉行动
　　揭露美国支持诺萨万集团企图把老挝变成军事侵略基地
    新华社河内23日电　据寮国战斗部队电台今天广播，老挝爱国战线党中央委员会主席苏发努冯亲王再次致函1954年关于印度支那问题的日内瓦会议两位主席，要求他们帮助立即制止美帝国主义者及其东南亚条约组织侵略集团中的仆从对老挝内政的干涉。
    在9月21日发出的这封信还要求老挝国际监察和监督委员会恢复活动和再度召开日内瓦会议，以便保证贯彻执行关于老挝问题的日内瓦协议。
    这封信列举了美国、泰国最近以来干涉和侵略老挝的行动。信中说，这些行动表明，美国侵略集团和它在东南亚的走狗曾经和正在继续公然协助富米·诺萨万叛乱集团实现它们向万象进攻和反对政府的计划，它们实际上已经完全不顾日内瓦协议的规定，不顾我国的独立、主权和我国人民的正当愿望，对老挝进行了武装干涉。这是为了把老挝变为美国的新式的殖民地和军事侵略基地。很显然，这些行为将引起不但威胁老挝、而且也威胁整个印度支那和东南亚的争端。
    苏发努冯亲王因此向日内瓦会议两位主席提出三点要求：
    “（一）以关于印度支那的日内瓦会议主席的权力和资格，要求美国好战分子和东南亚集团的反动势力立即停止对老挝的一切干涉，首先是停止唆使和支持富米·诺萨万叛乱集团对老挝王国政府的武装叛乱活动。
      （二）在一定的时间内，设法恢复老挝国际监察和监督委员会的活动，来制止美国侵略集团和它在东南亚的走狗的干涉行动。
      （三）设法召开日内瓦会议参加国的非常会议，来谴责侵略者的罪行，并且寻求适当的措施来制止美国侵略集团的干涉活动，保证关于老挝的日内瓦协议的彻底履行。”
    苏发努冯亲王回述说，他在9月16日致两位主席的信中，曾经提醒他们注意美帝国主义侵略者、泰国和越南南方反动集团同富米·诺萨万集团密切地勾结，公然反对老挝王国政府的配合行动。苏发努冯说，老挝人民已经起来坚决反对侵略。老挝王国政府也曾经屡次极力反对这种粗暴的干涉。然而，美国侵略者、泰国和越南南方反动集团不但没有停止这些活动，相反，在最近几天又加强对我国的侵略活动。苏发努冯亲王举出这种侵略活动的具体事例包括：（一）从9月16日到19日一连四天，泰国政府曾经让其中混有泰国人的富米·诺萨万的反动军队从泰国的基地向老挝领土上的目标和万象的和平居民开炮。
    （二）9月18日，泰国军队总司令部命令在万象对面的廊开省和产波和西川迈地区的地方当局禁止人民在公路上通行，这些公路只准许用来运输军队和军用物资。
      （三）同一天，在美国侵略集团的唆使下，“革命委员会”主席文翁·纳占巴塞呼吁东南亚侵略集团进行武装干涉，来反对老挝合法政府和老挝人民。此后，泰国外交部马上宣布要立即“考虑上述呼吁”，并在9月21日正式宣布决定建议东南亚军事集团向老挝进行武装干涉。
      （四）9月21日，从泰国基地起飞的泰国飞机把重型武器供应了富米·诺萨万在巴汕（万象下游一百五十公里）的军队。
      苏发努冯亲王说，“为了老挝、印度支那和东南亚的和平的利益，我们希望对此负有重大责任
  的两位主席公正地、毅然地回答我们在我国正在经历的这些特别严重的时刻再一次向您们发出的恳切的呼吁。”
