Seize the Time to Do a Good Job in Autumn Seed Selection
Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences Institute of Genetics and Breeding

Our industrious and intelligent farmers have rich experience in crop seed selection. Many crops widely cultivated in agriculture today, such as Japonica rice, broadleaf wheat, soybeans, millet, and sorghum, originated in China. By 1959, the sown area of improved varieties in our country had increased to over 85%.

The combination of mass seed selection and research institute seed selection is a major characteristic of our country's seed selection work. This ensures the popularization and improvement of seed selection work. At present, the cultivation of improved varieties of various crops has not yet been fully popularized in our country. For crops where improved varieties have been basically popularized (such as cotton), it is still necessary to continuously strengthen rejuvenation and variety replacement work. At this crucial time of the autumn harvest, we must seize the opportunity and vigorously launch an autumn seed selection campaign.

Implement the "Four Selfs and One Supplement" Policy for Breeding Work

"Self-breeding, self-selection, self-retention, self-use, supplemented by necessary adjustments" is a breeding policy that suits China's specific conditions. In order to improve the quality of improved varieties, a field selection should be carried out before the autumn harvest. Field selection should be carried out on seed retention land, but if there is no seed retention land or the amount of seed retention land is insufficient, it can also be carried out in production fields where crops are growing well and the varieties are relatively pure. During field selection, remove a small number of mixed and inferior plants, and harvest, thresh, and store them separately for sowing next year.

Field selection is necessary because during sowing, harvesting, transportation, threshing grounds, and storage, due to non-strict procedures, mixing with other varieties or even other crops may occur; natural hybridization leads to variation; poor cultivation conditions, and other situations can cause varieties to degenerate or even produce undesirable variations, reducing the quality of improved varieties. Therefore, field selection must be carried out every year. Not only should field selection be carried out when converting production fields to seed retention land, but also field selection should be carried out on the original seed retention land.

For autumn sowing seed retention land, it is more appropriate to adopt a two-level seed retention system. That is, use the seeds selected from ears in the first year to plant first-level seed retention land, and carry out ear selection on this seed retention land for sowing first-level seed retention land in the following year. The remaining seeds are used to plant second-level seed retention land in the second year, and the seeds harvested from this are used for large-field production in the third year. In this way, selecting a small number of seeds from ears every year and planting first-level and second-level seed retention land separately can continuously supply high-quality seeds for large-field production.

Pay Attention to the Combination of Improved Varieties to Ensure Stable and High Yields

Another issue to pay attention to during autumn seed selection and autumn sowing is the rational combination of improved varieties. That is, when selecting and retaining seeds in the field, it is best not to select only one variety, but to select several better varieties. This is because if a region cultivates a single variety, it is not conducive to yield stability. Taking winter wheat as an example, some regions have excessively promoted a certain variety in a single way. Due to the possible mutation of the germ of a certain plant disease, this variety lost its original resistance to this plant disease and became a highly susceptible variety, resulting in certain losses.

In addition, there are also multiple requirements for varieties in terms of cultivation systems and cultivation levels. In order to expand the multiple cropping index, it is often desirable to use early-maturing varieties, but in order to solve the shortage of labor and machinery during sowing and harvesting periods, it is also desirable for the growth period of varieties to be somewhat different. Therefore, it is extremely difficult to find an absolutely ideal variety that can resist various disasters and meet various requirements. When retaining seeds during the autumn harvest, it is best for a region to select three to five varieties, plant them in combination next year, and use the most ideal one as the main variety to form a variety combination and give full play to their wide adaptability, thereby ensuring stable and high yields. When determining the variety combination, on the one hand, it is necessary to consider the regional conditions, and on the other hand, it is necessary to look at the variety characteristics. Generally, the following should be considered: 1. Growth period, that is, the growth period of several varieties should preferably be slightly different, so that it is easier to reasonably arrange labor and machinery for sowing and harvesting and carry out batch operations. 2. Ability to resist natural disasters, that is, according to the natural disasters that occur relatively frequently in the region, decide to select some varieties that have high yields in normal years and have less or no yield reduction in disaster years for combined planting. If disasters occur relatively frequently, it is best to select a variety that has the strongest resistance to this type of disaster as the main variety, even if its yield is not the highest in normal years, and combine it with several other varieties that have higher yields in normal years, even though their disaster resistance is weaker. If there is more than one type of disaster that occurs, the varieties that can resist the main disaster should be the main ones, combined with other more suitable varieties. 3. Adaptability to different cultivation conditions, that is, select some varieties that can suit various terrains, land fertility, and irrigation conditions in the region for combined planting, and the varieties that can suit the main cultivation conditions in the region should be the main ones.

Select the Best from the Best to Create More and Better New Varieties

National agricultural labor model Chen Yongkang used the "one ear transmission" method to select and breed the famous rice variety "Laolaiqing." Farmer breeder Xu Sanda used the mixed selection method to select a variety "Laolaiduo" from the "Laolaiqing" variety that was better than "Laolaiqing." This method of selecting the best from the best is a brilliant creation and valuable experience of our country's farmers in seed selection work, and it is also a fatal blow to the metaphysical viewpoints of bourgeois scholars who said "pure line theory" and "selection is ineffective in the offspring of self-pollinating crops." In fact, all organisms are in constant change and development. Under good cultivation conditions, crops are always changing and developing in the direction that meets the cultivation goals. For example, the high-yielding traits of crops such as rice and wheat, such as large ears and heavy grains, are always formed under conditions where fertilizer and water are adequately supplied and light and temperature are suitable. This is the general trend, although there are still differences between individuals. This is the theoretical basis for selecting the best from the best.

When carrying out the selection of the best from the best, mixed selection, plant selection, boll selection (cotton), or grain selection can be used in combination with specific circumstances, or several methods can be combined. In some areas where natural disasters have occurred, it is necessary to focus on selecting for resistance to adversity. Natural disasters for crops are a bad thing, but drought, flood, disease, insects, etc. are also a test and identification of superior varieties. Those that can withstand the test are often the best of the best and should be selected and used as a basis for cultivating stable and high-yielding new varieties. For example, the wind-resistant rice variety "Aijiao Nante" and the aphid-resistant wheat variety "Sanliu Mai" were both selected by farmer breeders in years when natural disasters occurred.

Further Popularize and Improve Hybrid Breeding Work

In recent years, hybrid breeding work has been greatly developed. Some have already seen results, such as the "Neixiang No. 5" wheat bred by Henan farmer breeder Gong Wensheng, which has already played a role in production; others are very promising, such as the thousand-grain ear rice bred by Guangdong farmer breeder Yang Minghan, which is being continuously consolidated and improved.

It must be noted that hybridization is only a part of breeding work, and it is the first step in hybrid breeding work. The role of hybridization is to shake up and enrich the heredity of crops and improve the vitality of crops. Hybridization can only produce new and superior varieties when combined with appropriate selection and breeding. Therefore, for this year's hybridization work, the hybrid seeds must be harvested before the autumn harvest according to the combination (same parents) and stored properly. In corn isolation hybrid areas, the parents should be harvested separately, that is, the female parent should be harvested first, and then the male parent should be harvested to avoid mixing. For hybrid offspring that were hybridized before last year, a strict selection should be carried out before the autumn harvest, and then the selected lines or single plants should be harvested and threshed separately. Eliminate them again during the indoor seed examination process. When selecting and eliminating, be both ruthless and accurate to reduce unnecessary workload and improve work efficiency. However, the elimination of distant hybridization offspring should be more cautious, because the genetic rules and expressions of distant hybridization offspring are often different from inter-varietal hybridization. For example, the thousand-grain ear trait of the thousand-grain ear rice bred by Yang Minghan only appeared after the fourth generation of hybridization.

In addition to selection, the hybrid offspring should also be directionally cultivated, that is, using the unstable characteristics of hybrid heredity, by controlling cultivation conditions, to promote the consolidation and development of some important traits of crops in the direction that meets the breeding goals. For example, Gong Wensheng used the method of expanding the nutritional area and removing tillers and arranging the ears to carry out directional cultivation of "Neixiang No. 5" wheat. Now the thousand-grain weight of this variety has reached 57 grams under large-field production conditions (the thousand-grain weight of generally cultivated wheat varieties is about 30 grams).

What needs attention in autumn sowing is: 1. Pay attention to the cultivation conditions of hybrid seeds, such as appropriately expanding the nutritional area and reasonably increasing fertilizer application. 2. Prepare for next year's hybridization work, mainly the selection and sowing of parents. The selection of parents should not only select those with prominent advantages, but also those with the fewest disadvantages; if one of the parents is a locally cultivated variety, several rows of one or several varieties used as the other parent (female parent) can be sown in the middle of the large field, so that the female parent can be freely pollinated after emasculation in the future. The advantages of this method are: the procedures are simple, saving manpower and material resources, the seed setting rate is high, and the female parent has the opportunity to choose suitable pollen, so the segregation phenomenon in the offspring is often less, so the plants are strong and vigorous.

Actively Carry Out Regional Identification Work of Improved Varieties

In China's agricultural production, various crops have many excellent varieties. In the past two or three years, people's communes, scientific research institutions, and schools in various places have also created and bred a batch of new excellent varieties and promising excellent lines. However, any excellent variety is relative and inseparable from specific cultivation conditions. Therefore, organizing relevant regions to carry out joint regional trials and identifying the adaptability of improved varieties is of great significance for giving full play to the role of improved varieties. Therefore, it is necessary to combine the autumn harvest to summarize this year's regional identification trials of improved varieties and do a good job in the regional identification of improved varieties of autumn-sown crops. This work can be carried out in combination from top to bottom and from bottom to top. That is, within the scope of a province, scientific research institutions and agricultural colleges can divide relatively mature varieties into representative locations for joint regional trials and select several varieties from them to arrange production trials at multiple points; at the same time, each people's commune can, according to conditions, use the new varieties bred by the commune or neighboring people's communes, as well as varieties that participate in regional trials and have been preliminarily proven to be applicable in this area, to conduct regional trials or production trials to further confirm their production value, and then submit the more superior varieties to the regional trial network arranged from top to bottom to identify their adaptability in other regions. In this way, the production performance of new varieties can be identified locally, and improved varieties can be exchanged, compared on a wider basis and under diversified conditions, so that some better varieties can expand their application scope, thereby accelerating the regionalization process of improved varieties.

　　抓紧时机做好秋季选种工作
　　中国农业科学院遗传育种研究所
　  勤劳、智慧的我国农民，对作物选种具有丰富的经验。现在农业上广泛栽培的粳稻、阔叶小麦、大豆、谷子、高粱等许多作物的故乡都是中国。我国良种播种面积至1959年已提高到85％以上。
    群众选种和研究机关选种相结合，是我国选种工作的一个主要特点。这样做保证了选种工作的普及和提高。目前，我国各种作物的良种栽培尚未全面普及。对于良种已经基本上普及的作物（如棉花）也还要不断加强复壮和品种更换的工作。当此秋收重要关头，必须抓紧时机，大搞秋季选种运动。
    贯彻“四自一辅”的良种繁育工作方针
      “自繁、自选、自留、自用，辅之以必要的调剂”，是适合我国具体情况的良种繁育工作方针。为了提高良种质量，在秋收前要进行一次片选。片选应该在留种地上进行，但是如果没有留种地或者留种地数量不足，也可在庄稼长得较好、品种比较优良纯净的生产田内进行。片选时将少数混杂的和不良的植株拔掉，剩下来的单收、单打、单藏，留待明年播种。
    片选所以必要，是因为在播种、收获、运输、晒场、贮藏等过程中，由于手续不严格，可能与其他品种甚至其他作物发生混杂；天然杂交导致变异；栽培条件不好等情况都会使品种趋于退化甚至产生不良变异，降低良种的质量。因此，片选必须每年进行。不但把生产田改为留种地要进行片选，原来的留种地也要进行片选。
    秋播留种地，以采用两级留种制度较为合适。即用第一年穗选的种子种植一级留种地，并在这个留种地上进行穗选，以供下年播种一级留种地之用，其余种子用于第二年种植二级留种地，由此收获的种子供第三年大田生产之用。这样每年穗选少量种子，并分别种植一、二级留种地，就可以连续不断地以高质量的种子供应大田生产。
      注意良种搭配，保证稳定高产
    在秋季选种和秋播工作中要注意的另一个问题是良种的合理搭配，即在片选留种时，最好不要只就一个品种进行选择，而是选出较好的几个品种。因为一个地区如果栽培品种单一化，不利于产量的稳定。以冬小麦为例，有的地区曾因过分单一地推广某一品种，由于某项植病的菌种可能发生变异，这个品种丧失了它原来对这一植病的抵抗能力，变成极易感染的品种，所以受到一定的损失。
    此外，在耕作制度和栽培水平上对品种的要求也是多方面的。为了扩大复种指数，常常希望采用早熟品种，但是为了解决播种和收获时期的劳力和机具的紧张问题，又希望品种的生育期有些差别。因此，要想找一个能抵抗各种灾害、适合各种要求的绝对理想品种，是极其不易的。在秋收留种时，一个地区最好选择三至五个品种，明年搭配种植，以其中较理想的一个作为主要品种，形成一个品种组合，发挥它们的广泛适应性，从而保证稳定高产。在确定品种组合时，一方面要根据地区条件，一方面要看品种特性，一般应当考虑：1、生育期，即几个品种的生育期最好稍有差别，这样在播种和收获时都比较容易合理安排劳力和机具，进行分批作业。2、抵抗自然灾害的能力，即根据本地区比较经常发生的自然灾害，决定选择一些常年产量较高，灾年减产较少或不减产的品种，搭配种植。如果灾年比较经常，最好选用一个常年产量虽不是最高，但抵抗这种灾害能力最强的品种作为主要品种，而以另外几个虽然抗灾害能力较弱，但常年产量较高的品种搭配种植。如果发生的灾害不止一种，应以能抗主要灾害的品种为主，搭配上其他比较合适的品种。3、对不同栽培条件的适应性，即选用能够适合本地区的各种地势地形、土地肥力、灌溉条件的一些品种搭配种植，而以能够适合本地区主要栽培条件的品种为主。
      优中选优，创造更多更好的新品种
    全国农业劳动模范陈永康用“一穗传”方法选育出著名水稻品种“老来青”，农民育种家徐三大用混选方法从“老来青”品种中选出比“老来青”更好的品种“老来多”。这种优中选优的方法，是我国农民在选种工作上的光辉创造和宝贵经验，也是对资产阶级学者所说的“纯系学说”、“在自花授粉作物后代中选择无效”等等形而上学观点的一个致命打击。事实上，一切生物都处在不断的变化和发展中。在良好的栽培条件下，作物总是朝着符合于栽培目标的方向不断变化，不断发展。例如稻麦等作物的穗大、粒重等丰产性状总是在肥水供应恰当、光照温度合适的条件下形成的，这是总的趋势，尽管个体之间还有差别。这便是优中选优的理论根据。
    在进行优中选优时，可以结合具体情况采用混选、株选、铃选（棉花）或者粒选，也可以几种方法结合进行。在一些发生了自然灾害的地区，要抓抗逆选种。农作物遭受自然灾害是一件坏事，但是旱、涝、病、虫等也是对优良品种的一个考验和鉴定，经得起考验的，常常是优中之优，应当加以选拔，并在此基础上培育稳定高产的新品种。例如抗风的水稻品种“矮脚南特”和抗蚜的小麦品种“三六麦”，都是农民育种家在发生了自然灾害的年头选拔出来的。
      进一步普及和提高杂交育种的工作
    近年来杂交育种工作有了很大开展。有的已见成果，如河南农民育种家龚文生所育成的“内乡五号”小麦已在生产上发挥作用；有的大有希望，如广东农民育种家杨明汉所培育的千粒穗水稻正在继续加以巩固和提高。
    必须注意的是，杂交只是育种工作的一部分，是杂交育种工作的第一步。杂交的作用是动摇和丰富作物的遗传性，提高作物的生命力。杂交只有结合适当的选择和培育才能育出新的优良品种。因此对于今年进行的杂交工作，要在秋收之前按组合（同一父母本）将杂交种子收下，妥善保存。在玉米隔离杂交区内，父母本要分别收获，即先收母本，再收父本，以免混杂。对于去年以前进行杂交的杂种后代，要在秋收前进行一次严格的选拔，然后将中选的品系或单株进行单收、单打。在室内考种过程中再淘汰一次。在选择和淘汰时，既要狠，又要准，以减少不必要的工作量并提高工作效率。但是对于远缘杂交后代的淘汰应当比较慎重一些，因为远缘杂交后代的遗传规律及其表现常和品种间杂交不同，例如杨明汉培育的千粒穗水稻，其千粒特性是在杂交第四代以后才出现的。
    对于杂交后代的处理，除选拔外，还应当进行定向培育，即利用杂种遗传性尚未稳定的特点，通过控制栽培条件，促使作物的一些重要性状向符合育种目标的方向巩固和发展。例如龚文生采用扩大营养面积和去蘖、整穗的方法对“内乡五号”小麦进行定向培育，现在这个品种的千粒重在大田生产情况下已经达到五十七克
  （一般栽培小麦品种的千粒重约为三十克）。
    在秋播中需要注意的是：1、注意杂交种的培育条件，如适当扩大营养面积和合理增施肥料等。2、为明年的杂交工作做好准备，主要是亲本的选择和播种。选择亲本不但要选优点突出的，而且要选缺点最少的；如果亲本之一为本地栽培品种，可在大田中间分别把作为另一亲本（母本）的一个或数个品种播种数行，以便将来母本去雄后进行自由授粉。这种方法的好处是：手续简单，节省人力物力，结实率高，加上母本有选择合适花粉的机会，后代分离现象常常较少，所以植株健壮、旺盛。
      积极开展良种区域性鉴定的工作
    在我国农业生产上，各种作物都有很多优良品种。近二、三年来，各地人民公社、科学研究机关和学校又创育出一批新的优良品种和有希望的优良品系。但是任何优良品种都是相对的，是和具体的栽培条件分不开的，所以组织有关地区进行联合区域试验，鉴定良种的适应性，对于充分发挥良种的作用具有重大意义。因此有必要结合秋收把今年的良种区域性鉴定试验进行一次总结，并做好秋播作物的良种区域性鉴定工作。这个工作可自上而下和自下而上结合进行。即在一个省的范围内，科学研究机关和农业院校可将比较成熟的品种分区发到有代表性的地点进行联合区域试验，并从中确定几个品种多点布置生产试验；同时各个人民公社可根据条件将本公社或邻近人民公社选育出来的新品种，以及参加区域试验并初步证明在这一地带有应用可能的品种，进行区域试验或生产试验，进一步肯定其生产价值，再将其中比较优越的品种提交自上而下所布置的区域试验网，以鉴定它在其他地区的适应性。这样，既可以就地鉴定新品种的生产性能，又可以交流良种，在更广泛的基础上和多样化的条件下进行比较，使一些较好的品种扩大应用范围，从而加速良种区域化的进程。
