Everyone Uses Their Brains, Works Cleverly, Saves Labor
　　No. 1 Team of Liming Brigade Reforms Unreasonable Production Processes and Farming Methods
　　Dengta Commune Finds Ways to Eliminate Dodder, Saving Large Amounts of Labor Annually
According to Ningxia Daily, the No. 1 Production Team of the Liming Brigade of the Xigang Commune in Helan boldly reformed the production process and old farming methods, saving labor in many ways.
　　Each laborer in the No. 1 Production Team was responsible for an average of 25.7 mu of cultivated land. In response to the reality of having more land than people, the team's Party branch put forward the slogan "Fewer people doing more work, one person doing the job of several," mobilizing the masses to save labor and strengthen intensive cultivation by reforming the production process and old farming methods.
　　Based on the spirit of being both clever and effective, the members thought ahead to the next step and improved field management methods. This year, the whole team planted 618 mu of paddy rice. Four irrigation workers adopted the method of opening waterways wherever it was low, keeping the fields level and eliminating field corners, so there was no need to allocate a large number of laborers to level them.
　　This year, when harvesting hemp, the Party branch mobilized the members to come up with many new methods of retting hemp. After the first work group harvested more than 16 mu of hemp, they retted the hemp in an existing 200-meter-long old canal along the field. Six laborers spent half a day retting the hemp. The retting method for the second group's seven mu of hemp was even simpler. Four laborers spent a morning slightly raising the ridges of the field and retting the hemp in place. The entire team of 34 mu of hemp was retted by 30 people in just two and a half days. In previous years, the hemp was first pulled to the edge of the village and then retted in water pits. The retting pits were three to four hundred meters away from the fields. The labor required just to pull the 34 mu of hemp from the fields to the water pits was equivalent to the work of 136 laborers, 136 livestock, and 136 carts for one day. This year, all of these manpower, livestock power, and vehicles were saved. Furthermore, after the second work group took out the retted hemp from the field, they used the water from retting to irrigate 11 mu of land as fertilizer, which saved another batch of labor and livestock power. During the summer harvest, according to the old habits of farmers for many years, wheat was pulled to the threshing ground, first stacked up, and then taken down from the stacks to thresh. This year, when harvesting wheat, they broke with convention, eliminated the stacking process, and started threshing earlier. In the past, three laborers could stack 1,000 bundles of wheat a day, but this year, 69 laborers were saved in this aspect.
　　Because the No. 1 Team boldly reformed old farming methods, saving a large amount of labor, they were able to better implement intensive farming. For example, all of the team's more than 600 mu of fallow land has been turned over and sunned once, and more than 400 mu have been turned over twice. The plan is to turn over the entire area three times to loosen the soil, thoroughly sun it, improve soil fertility, and lay the foundation for increased production next year.

According to Ningxia Daily, can the harm of "dodder" to crops be fundamentally eliminated, and can the labor and time spent on picking dodder every year be reduced? The Dengta Commune in Zhongwei County has researched and developed a method to eliminate dodder through practice.
　　This year, the Dengta Commune planted a total of 5,580 mu of green beans, most of which were harmed by dodder. In order to remove the dodder, more than 3,000 female laborers were mobilized after the wheat harvest in mid-July, and three rounds of intensive picking were carried out successively. Later, cadres and members raised a question: Can dodder be fundamentally eliminated? In response to this question, the Dengta Commune Party Committee adopted a method combining cadres, experienced farmers, and technicians to meet in the fields, going deep into the experimental fields of production teams with more and less dodder, and using comparison and analysis to study the causes of dodder occurrence, and proposed a method to fundamentally eliminate dodder.
　　In early August, the Dengta Commune Party Committee held on-site meetings in the No. 5 Team of the Futang Management Area and the No. 6 Team of the Xuanhe Management Area, which had basically eliminated dodder. Based on the experience here, it was decided to take the following measures: When picking dodder, special attention should be paid to picking clean dodder seeds; reasonable crop rotation should be implemented when sowing; and seeds should be carefully selected before sowing.
　　At present, all management areas and production teams in the commune have mobilized a large number of female laborers according to the current production situation and labor conditions, and are taking advantage of the opportunity before the dodder seeds are ripe and fall off, to pick clean dodder seeds block by block, field by field, acre by acre, and plant by plant, eliminating the possibility of dodder occurring next year, so that millet, sorghum, and other crops that are not afraid of dodder parasitism can be replanted next year, eliminating dodder through reasonable crop rotation. At the same time, the whole commune also selected more than 1,000 mu of green beans on beach land and rice stubble green beans without dodder, which will be harvested and threshed separately in the future, and reserved for next year's seeds, and then carefully selected once before sowing to ensure that dodder seeds are not planted with the bean seeds. In order to prevent dodder seeds from being mixed in with manure, it was decided to promote the method of the No. 5 Team of the Futang Management Area, which is to winnow the dodder seeds from the bean stalks during threshing and collect them to be stir-fried and boiled as pig feed or fertilizer. Now, all 58 dodder picking groups in the commune have intensively picked dodder seeds from 3,500 mu, and the remaining green bean fields are continuing to be removed. (Attached picture)

　　人人动脑筋　巧干活　省劳力
　　黎明大队一队改革不合理生产过程和耕作方法
    灯塔公社设法消灭黄藤子每年可节省大批劳力
    据宁夏日报消息　贺兰习岗公社黎明大队第一生产小队大胆地改革生产过程，改革旧的耕作方法，从多方面节约了劳动力。
    第一生产小队每个劳力平均负担二十五点七亩耕地。小队党支部针对地多人少的实际情况，提出了“人少多办事，一个顶几个”的口号，发动群众从改革生产过程和改革旧的耕作方法入手，节约劳力，加强精耕细作。
    社员们本着又巧、又好的精神，上步为下步着想，改进田间管理方法。全小队今年种了六百一十八亩水稻，四个淌水员采取了哪里洼哪里开口淌水的办法，使田地保持平整，消灭了田嘴子，再用不着抽出大批劳力平田嘴子了。
    今年收割大麻时，党支部发动社员想出了许多新的沤麻方法。第一作业组十六亩多大麻割倒以后，就在田边原有的一道二百米长的旧渠道里沤麻，六个劳力用了半天时间就把麻沤好了。二组的七亩大麻，沤麻方法更简单，他们用了四个劳力搞了一早晨，把田的田埂略微加高，原地沤麻。全小队三十四亩麻，三十个人，只用两天半时间就全部沤好了。去年沤麻是先把麻拉到村边，再利用水坑沤麻。沤麻坑离田有三、四百米，三十四亩麻光从田里拉到水坑旁所用的工，就相当于一百三十六个劳力、一百三十六头牲畜、一百三十六辆大车一天的工作量。今年，这些人力、畜力和车辆就全都省下了。这还不算，第二作业组把在田里沤好的麻取出以后，又将沤麻的水，用渠水冲灌了十一亩地，当作肥料，这就又节省了一批劳畜力。在夏收中，按农民多年的旧习惯，都是把小麦拉到场上先垛起来，然后再从垛上拿下来打场。今年收割小麦时，他们打破了常规，取消了垛垛这道工序，提早打场。往年三个劳力一天能垛一千捆麦子，今年在这方面就节省了六十九个劳力。
    第一小队由于大胆改革了旧的耕作方法，节约了大批劳动力，因此，能更好地实行精耕细作。如全队六百多亩槎地，都已普遍翻晒了一次，其中四百多亩还翻过了两遍，计划普遍翻三次，做到土壤翻松、晒透，提高地力，为明年增产打基础。
    据宁夏日报消息　能不能从根本消灭“黄藤子”对作物的危害，减少历年花费在摘黄藤子上的劳动和时间呢？中卫县灯塔公社通过实践研究出消灭黄藤子的办法。
    灯塔公社今年共种五千五百八十多亩青豆，大部分受到了黄藤子为害。为了摘掉黄藤子，从7月中旬小麦收割以后，就抽调了三千多名妇女劳力，先后突击摘了三次。后来干部和社员们提出了一个问题：能不能从根本上消灭黄藤子呢？灯塔公社党委针对这个问题，采取了干部、老农和技术员三结合的方法会师田间，深入到黄藤子多和黄藤子少的生产队试验田中，用对比、分析的办法，研究黄藤子发生的原因，提出了从根本上消灭黄藤子的办法。
    8月上旬，灯塔公社党委在已经基本上消灭了黄藤子的福堂管理区五队和宣和管理区六队召开了现场会。根据这里的经验，决定采取如下措施：在摘黄藤子时特别要摘净黄藤种子；在播种时合理倒槎；播种前精选种子。
    目前全公社各管理区、生产队都根据当前生产情况和劳力情况，抽调了大批妇女劳力，趁黄藤子种子还没成熟脱落的机会，逐块、逐田、一亩不漏、一株不丢地摘净黄藤子种子，把明年发生黄藤子的可能消灭在今年，以便明年改种不怕黄藤子寄生的糜、谷等作物，从合理倒槎上消灭黄藤子。同时，全公社还选出一千多亩没有黄藤子的滩地青豆和稻槎青豆，将来进行单收、单打，留作明年种子，播种前再精选一次，保证不叫黄藤子随豆种下地。为了不让黄藤种子掺在粪里，决定推广福堂管理区五队的方法，打场时从豆秸中扬掉、并搜集起来经过炒、煮，作为猪饲料或肥料。现在，全公社的五十八个摘黄藤子小组，已经突击摘黄藤种子三千五百亩，下余的青豆田正在继续摘除。（附图片）
