Xinhua News Agency, New York, September 23rd (TASS): The head of the Soviet delegation to the 15th session of the United Nations General Assembly, Khrushchev, submitted a declaration on granting independence to colonial countries and peoples to the General Assembly for discussion on September 23rd. The declaration solemnly announced the demand for immediate independence for colonial countries and peoples.

Colonialism and colonial administration should be completely abolished. The people of colonial territories, trust territories, and other non-self-governing territories should decide their own destiny and the form of government of their countries.

The declaration emphasized that members of the United Nations cannot remain indifferent to the fact that more than 100 million people in the ancient lands of Asia and Africa, on the islands of Oceania, and in the lands of the Caribbean are still suffering from colonial enslavement. Colonial peoples do not want to live in conditions of enslavement and lack of freedom.

The declaration stated that no force of oppression and tyranny can maintain the decadent colonial system. Colonialism is in its death throes.

The declaration, in the name of the United Nations, appealed to all mankind and governments: we must not continue to be indifferent bystanders to the suffering of colonial peoples.

The declaration affirmed that the independence of colonial countries and peoples is the order of the day. The declaration emphasized that the colonial system deliberately and artificially maintains the backwardness of the colonial economy, hindering its industrialization and rational utilization of resources.

In fact, every sincere person and every government that advocates the equality of all peoples cannot fail to see that colonialism is a decadent and shameful phenomenon in modern human life. The complete and thorough elimination of colonialism will be the prelude to social progress and the vigorous development of industrial and agricultural technology, just as the cessation of the slave trade provided a powerful impetus to the development of social productive forces.

The declaration emphasized that the elimination of colonialism will be an important measure to ease international tensions.

The declaration announced that "the shameful colonial system should be buried." Colonial peoples should obtain genuine independence, not false independence, because under this false independence, they are actually confined within the scope of a disguised colonial system.

The declaration included an appeal from the United Nations to countries that possess colonies, calling on them to "hold equal negotiations with the leaders of colonial peoples and reach agreements on the establishment of free and independent colonial countries."

Xinhua News Agency, New York, September 23rd (TASS): The Soviet government proposed that all countries completely and finally eliminate all their armed forces and armaments in three consecutive stages within four years or any other agreed period. All disarmament measures should be subject to strict supervision.

This proposal is included in the "Basic Provisions of a Treaty on General and Complete Disarmament" submitted to the United Nations General Assembly for consideration today.

The first stage lasts approximately one year or one and a half years, during which it is stipulated that the production and destruction of all means of delivery of nuclear weapons will cease. All foreign military bases established on foreign territories will be revoked, and all foreign troops will be withdrawn from these territories. It is recommended that the manpower of the armed forces of all countries be greatly reduced. For the Soviet Union and the United States, the maximum limit for their armies is 1.7 million people. Conventional armaments should be reduced accordingly.

The Soviet government proposed that in the second stage, in addition to other measures, nuclear weapons, chemical weapons, biological weapons, and other weapons of mass destruction should be completely prohibited, the production of these weapons should cease, and stockpiled weapons should be destroyed. In addition, it is stipulated that the armed forces of all countries should be further reduced, and equipment and military technology should be reduced accordingly.

The Soviet government believes that in the third stage, the elimination of the armed forces and armaments of all countries should be completed, the production of weapons should not continue, the Ministry of National Defense, the General Staff, and various military, paramilitary institutions and organizations should be abolished, and appropriations for military purposes should not continue.

After the completion of the third stage of general and complete disarmament, countries will no longer have armies or weapons, and therefore, the danger of war will be eliminated forever. The Soviet government's statement said, "The world without weapons and without war that the people of all countries have dreamed of for many centuries will become a reality."

The Soviet government proposed that an appropriate working body, including representatives of non-aligned countries, should be established for disarmament negotiations. It believes that the restoration of the legitimate rights of the People's Republic of China in the United Nations will be an important step to ensure the success of disarmament negotiations.

The Soviet government believes that its new proposal is a solid foundation for drafting and signing a treaty on general and complete disarmament.

As the statement emphasized, the Soviet government has given more consideration to the views of Western countries in this proposal, and has considered their positions on many important issues. For example, they said that it is correct to combine measures to reduce nuclear weapons with measures to reduce armed forces and conventional armaments from the first stage.

The Soviet government's statement emphasized that it advocates effective international supervision of disarmament, but firmly opposes any attempt to forcibly supervise armaments without disarmament, which is nothing more than a legalized system of international espionage.

The statement pointed out that due to the position of Western countries, the year since the Soviet Union proposed general and complete disarmament at the 14th session of the United Nations General Assembly has unfortunately been wasted.

The Soviet government calls on the United Nations General Assembly to discuss the current situation with the utmost seriousness and take the necessary measures to eliminate the obstacles that hinder the solution of the disarmament issue.

    苏联向联合国大会提出两项文件
　　给予殖民地国家和人民独立的宣言宣布可耻的殖民制度应当埋葬
　　“全面和彻底裁军条约的基本条款”提出分三个阶段裁军的建议
    新华社26日讯　塔斯社纽约23日讯：出席联合国大会第十五届会议的苏联代表团团长赫鲁晓夫在9月23日把关于给予殖民地国家和人民独立的宣言提交大会讨论。宣言庄严地宣布了关于立即给殖民地国家和人民以独立的要求。
    殖民制度、殖民管理应当全部废除。殖民地人民、托管地人民、和其他非自治领土的人民应当自己决定自己的命运和自己决定国家的管理形式。
    宣言强调指出，联合国会员国不能对在亚非古老的土地上、在大洋洲各岛屿上、在加勒比海地区的土地上的一亿多人继续遭受殖民主义的奴役保持冷淡。殖民地人民不希望在奴役和不自由的条件下生活。
    宣言说，任何压迫和专横的势力都不能保持腐朽的殖民制度。殖民主义正在作垂死挣扎。
    宣言以联合国名义向全人类和各国政府呼吁——不能继续做殖民地人民痛苦的漠不关心的旁观者。
    宣言确认，殖民地国家和人民的独立是时代的命令。宣言强调指出，殖民制度蓄意、人为地保持殖民地经济的落后性，阻止它们的工业化和合理利用资源。
    实际上，主张各国人民平等的每一个诚挚的人和每一个政府都不能不看到，殖民主义是现代人类生活中腐朽的和可耻的现象。全部彻底消灭殖民主义将是社会进步、工农业技术蓬勃发展的序幕，就如同停止贩卖奴隶所给予社会生产力发展的强大的推动力一样。
    宣言强调指出，消灭殖民主义将是缓和国际紧张局势的一个重要措施。
    宣言宣布，“可耻的殖民制度应当埋葬”。殖民地人民应当获得真正的独立，而不是虚假的独立，因为在这种虚假的独立下，实际上他们是被限制在变相的殖民制度的范围内。
    宣言中包括有联合国向拥有殖民地国家的呼吁，呼吁它们“同殖民地人民的领导人举行平等的谈判，并达成关于殖民地国家建立自由和独立的协议”。
    新华社26日讯　塔斯社纽约23日讯：苏联政府建议，一切国家将在四年或任何其他商定的时期内，分三个连续的阶段完全和最后地取消它们的一切武装部队和军备。一切裁军措施应该予以严格的监督。
    这项建议包括在今天提交给联合国大会审议的“全面和彻底裁军条约的基本条款”中。
    第一个阶段大约历时一年或一年半，在这个阶段中规定将停止生产和销毁运载核武器的一切工具。撤销建立在外国领土上的一切外国军事基地，并且从这些领土上撤退一切外国军队。建议大大裁减各国武装部队的人力。对苏联和美国来说，他们军队的最高限额为一百七十万人。常规军备应相应地缩减。
    苏联政府建议，在第二阶段中除采取其他措施之外，完全禁止核武器、化学武器、生物武器和其他大规模毁灭性的武器，停止生产并且销毁储存的这些武器。此外还规定进一步裁减各国武装部队，并相应地裁减装备和军事技术。
    苏联政府认为，在第三阶段，应该完成取消所有国家的武装部队和军备，不继续生产武器，取消国防部、总参谋部以及各种军事、准军事机构和组织，并且不继续拨款用于军事目的。
    在完成第三阶段的全面和彻底裁军以后，各国将不再有军队或武器，因此，战争的危险将永远铲除。苏联政府的声明说，“各国人民许多世纪以来梦想的没有武器和没有战争的世界将成为事实。”
    苏联政府建议，应当为裁军谈判建立一个包括不结盟国家代表在内的适当的工作机构，它相信，恢复中华人民共和国在联合国中的合法权利将是保证裁军谈判获得成功的一个重要步骤。
    苏联政府认为，它的新建议是起草和签订全面和彻底裁军条约的稳固基础。
    正如声明所强调的，苏联政府在这个建议中对西方国家的观点作了更多的考虑，在许多重要问题上考虑了它们的立场。例如，它们说，从第一阶段开始，就把裁减核武器方面的措施和裁减武装部队和常规军备的措施结合起来是正确的。
    苏联政府的声明强调说，它主张对裁军进行有效的国际监督，但是坚决反对那种没有裁军的强行监督军备的任何企图，这种企图只不过是合法化的国际间谍制度。
    声明指出，由于西方国家的立场，苏联在第十四届联合国大会上提出全面彻底裁军的建议以来的一年时间不幸白白地浪费掉了。
    苏联政府呼吁联合国大会用最认真的态度来讨论当前的局势，采取必要的措施来消除妨碍解决裁军问题的障碍。
