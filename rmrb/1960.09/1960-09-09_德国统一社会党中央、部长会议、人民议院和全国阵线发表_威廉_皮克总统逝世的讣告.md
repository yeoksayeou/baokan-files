Obituary jointly announced by the Central Committee of the German Socialist Unity Party, the Council of Ministers of the German Democratic Republic ,People's Chamber of the German Democratic Republic and the National Council of the National Front of Democratic Germany

The most loyal son of the German nation, the President of the German Democratic Republic, our Wilhelm Pieck, has passed away. With deep sorrow, the Central Committee of the German Socialist Unity Party, the Council of Ministers of the German Democractic Republic, the People's Chamber of the German Democratic Republic and the National Committee of the National Front of Democratic Germany announce this heavy loss suffered by our people.

A great life dedicated to the working class, to Germany, to peace and socialism, the life of one of the most outstanding talents of the German people, has come to an end.

Sixty-five years ago, Wilhelm Pieck, a carpenter apprentice, joined the ranks of the organized workers' movement and joined the Social Democratic Party. Since the mid-1890s, he has held high the red flag of socialism, never faltering. He shared the suffering of his class brothers and fought at the forefront, until the oppressed proletariat in eastern Germany became the victorious working class and this persecuted and hunted worker became the first president of the first German worker-peasant state of peace. Many generations of German workers have fought for the liberation of the working people, but have not been able to experience liberation. Wilhelm Pieck, who grew up under Bismarck's anti-socialist laws, had the duty to stand at the forefront and lead the people's cause to victory. Before the First World War of 1914-1918, Wilhelm Pieck belonged to the well-known representatives of the left wing of the German Social Democratic Party, who firmly and bravely opposed German imperialism and the darkest forces that plunged our people into the abyss of war. When this indescribable disaster broke out and millions of workers sacrificed in the trenches of Europe for the re-division of the world by the big capitalists, only Karl Liebknecht and Rosa Luxemburg, Franz Mehring, Clara Zetkin and Wilhelm Pieck were loyal to the cause of proletarian internationalism. In the darkness of the First World War, he was one of the stars that illuminated the road for the German working class. As one of the most capable organizers and agitators of the Spartacus League, his actions were truly for the nation when fighting against militarist robbers, war profiteers and accomplices in the leadership of the Social Democratic Party. Persecution, arrest and prison could not subdue him. In speeches and articles, as a soldier and in underground activities, he preached the overthrow of the instigators of the war that brought misfortune to our nation. He condemned the war of the rich and fought for the peace of the people.

When German imperialism was militarily defeated and the workers and soldiers revolted in November 1918, in order to liberate Germany from shame and misfortune, from the Junkers and arms capitalists and their generals, Wilhelm Pieck, as a leading member of the Spartacus League, made incomparable contributions. This was the social and national mission at that time. This mission was not fulfilled, and the Weimar Republic moved towards fascist destruction. Social and national betrayal extinguished the revolution, carried out massacres, Wilhelm Pieck barely escaped, and Karl Liebknecht and Rosa Luxemburg were murdered.

From the founding of the Communist Party of Germany, Wilhelm Pieck was its leader. The Party sent this tested worker cadre, who had already been a member of the Bremen City Council and the secretary of the Social Democratic Party of the Hanseatic City in 1906, to participate in the Berlin City Council, the Prussian State Parliament and the State Council and the Reichstag. During the fourteen years of the Weimar Republic, Wilhelm Pieck, as a member of the Central Committee of the German Communist Party in the style of Thälmann, contributed his great strength and wisdom to strengthening the anti-fascist peace forces and preventing the belligerent Nazis from seizing power through the establishment of a united front of German working-class parties and trade unions.

Inspired by the great example of the Great October Socialist Revolution, Wilhelm Pieck was an early disseminator of the truth about Soviet Russia. Through the study and application of the new understanding of Leninism, he enriched his broad Marxist knowledge and promoted the necessity of friendship between the German and Soviet peoples.

In 1928, the Communist International elected Wilhelm Pieck as secretary and member of the Executive Committee. The International Red Aid, an organization that supported persecuted workers and their members, appointed this selfless, always-ready proletarian vanguard fighter as its honorary chairman. German monopoly capitalists, Junkers, and generals, encouraged by the anti-communist coalition rule policy of the leaders of the German Social Democratic Party, handed over power to Hitler. In the black night of fascist brutality, Ernst Thälmann's call "Hitler - is war!" echoed. Seventy-two hours before the Reichstag was burned down, Wilhelm Pieck once again warned in the Berlin Sports Palace to unite all anti-fascists. After Ernst Thälmann was arrested, he was elected chairman of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Germany. In the spirit of Ernst Thälmann, he fought for the unity of all anti-Hitler elements and to save peace. At that time, the wishes of the selfless worker leaders were not realized, and the selfishness and shamelessness of the German imperialists who were eager to plunder and seize prevailed, which was the tragedy of our people.

At the outbreak of World War II, as twenty-five years before, Wilhelm Pieck stood at the forefront of the German Communist Party, tirelessly carrying out the struggle against imperialist war. In order to avoid the disaster of Germany, whether in meetings with Social Democratic Party cadres or with famous German writers, or later with captured members of the Wehrmacht, he always and everywhere promoted the principle of cooperation between all anti-fascists to rise up against the Hitler regime. As a socialist internationalist, for the sake of the people and the fatherland, against the instigators of the war of aggression, against the criminal leadership of the government, against the General Staff and the Konzerns, he appealed to German men and women, to the soldiers in the trenches and to the prisoners of war.

After the glorious Soviet army and its allies defeated the Hitler army, the long-sought goal, which was sworn to be achieved in the fascist concentration camps, was realized in the eastern part of Germany. As a guarantee for the liberation of the working class, the peasants and the intellectuals, and as a guarantee for the revival of the German nation, a united Marxist-Leninist workers' party was established. In Wilhelm Pieck, the excellent traditions of August Bebel's German workers' movement were integrated with the revolutionary experience of the German Left and the German Communist Party. Wilhelm Pieck's immortal contribution was his truly decisive participation in the establishment of the united party of the German working class in 1946. As an outstanding conqueror of the division caused by the opportunist leaders of the German Social Democratic Party and a successful creator of the unity of the German working class, he will be immortalized in the history of the German workers' movement. He played a prominent role in the founding of the Anti-Fascist Democratic Bloc, uniting all forces willing to build in the National Front of Democratic Germany. When the first German peace state was established in response to the establishment of a divided state in the western occupied zones by Western countries and their Bonn pawns, our people elected this long-tested, flawless fighter, this highly mature socialist in quality and politics, as the head of state of the German Democratic Republic. President Wilhelm Pieck's name and work symbolize the rise of a different, new and better Germany throughout the world. This country has nothing to do with fascists, militarists, Junkers, monopoly giants, and brutal aggressive ambitions. His name and work have won millions of friends for the German Democratic Republic.

In his old age, Wilhelm Pieck also participated as a leader in the formation and development of the German Democratic Republic at a turning point in European history, and experienced the socialist construction in the birthplace of socialist creators.

Wilhelm Pieck was the embodiment of a class-conscious German worker, socialist, revolutionary, and patriot. He embodied the German anti-imperialist struggle of our century. With his rich knowledge and revolutionary enthusiasm, with his wise advice and influential actions, he always stood at the post of fighting for a new Germany. He came from our people, and in the great battle between the forces of war and peace, as a trusted person of the people, he stood at the highest post of the German peace state. In him gathered morality and integrity, the wisdom of a long life and the great ideas of humanity, the flame of regeneration of the German nation and society. Wilhelm Pieck's work embodies the strength and talent of the working class to unite all peaceful and democratic forces in our country in the struggle for peace and socialism. A life full of struggle, suffering persecution and hardship, is also a life full of glory and victory. In our pain, we are also proud to have such a person among us and at our head. His vivid image, his thoughts and his actions are an immortal part of German history and the history of the international workers' movement.

His example lives on and inspires the people, especially the younger generation. The youth repaid the love of this fatherly friend, and he set a great example for the youth of a fighter, simple, honest, selfless and unyielding in dedicating himself to peace, socialism and sincere friendship with the Soviet people.

Dear friend and comrade Wilhelm Pieck, the German people admire your heroic life of service to the working people, socialism and the entire German nation. At your coffin, we swear: to protect the unity of the forces of the people and the working class, which were finally achieved in the German Democratic Republic and which were repeatedly divided by imperialism and reformism, as if protecting our own eyeballs.

Millions will take up the banner snatched by death from the aged worker president and carry it to the victory of socialism in the German Democratic Republic and to the victory of peace in all of Germany.

    德国统一社会党中央、部长会议、人民议院和全国阵线发表
    威廉·皮克总统逝世的讣告
    新华社柏林8日电　德国统一社会党中央委员会、德意志民主共和国部长会议、人民议院和民主德国全国阵线联合发表了关于威廉·皮克总统逝世的讣告。全文如下：
    德国统一社会党中央委员会、德意志民主共和国部长会议、德意志民主共和国人民议院和民主德国全国阵线联合讣告
    德国民族最忠诚的儿子、德意志民主共和国总统、我们的威廉·皮克与世长辞了。德国统一社会党中央委员会、德意志民主共和国部长会议、德意志民主共和国人民议院和民主德国全国阵线全国委员会怀着深切的悲痛宣布我们人民受到的这一沉重的损失。
    一个为工人阶级、为德国、为和平和社会主义服务的伟大生命、德国人民最杰出的人才之一的生命结束了。
    六十五年前，威廉·皮克这个木匠徒工走进了有组织的工人运动的行列，并且加入了社会民主党。上一世纪九十年代中叶以来，他高举着社会主义红旗，始终不倒。他分担了自己阶级弟兄的苦难，战斗在最前列，直到德国东部的被压迫的无产阶级成了胜利的工人阶级和这位被迫害和被追逐的工人成了第一个德国工农和平国家的第一任总统。很多代德国工人都为劳动人民的解放斗争过，但是没有能够经历解放。在俾斯麦的社会主义者法下长大的威廉·皮克，负有义务站在最前列把人民事业引向胜利。在1914—1918年第一次世界大战以前，威廉·皮克就属于德国社会民主党中坚定和勇敢地反对德国帝国主义和反对把我们人民陷入战争深渊的最黑暗势力的左翼的著名的代表者，当这个难以形容的灾难爆发和千百万工人在欧洲的战壕里为大资本家们重新瓜分世界而牺牲时，只有卡尔·李卜克内西和罗莎·卢森堡、弗朗茨·梅林、克拉拉·蔡特金和威廉·皮克忠于无产阶级国际主义事业。在第一次世界大战的黑夜里，他是那些给德国工人阶级照亮道路的明星之一。当作为斯巴达克团最有能力的组织家和鼓动家之一，在对军国主义强盗、战争发财者和社会民主党领导中的帮凶进行斗争时，他的行动是真正为了民族的。迫害、逮捕和监牢都不能使他屈服。在讲话和文章里，在作为士兵和在地下活动时，他都宣传推翻我们民族不幸的战争的发起者。他谴责富人的战争，他为人民的和平而斗争。
    当德国帝国主义军事上失败和工人、士兵在1918年11月革命时，为了使德国从耻辱和不幸、从容克地主和军火资本家以及他们的将军下解放出来，威廉·皮克作为斯巴达克团的领导成员，作出了无可比拟的工作。这曾是那时的社会和民族使命。这个使命没有实现，魏玛共和国走向法西斯的毁灭。社会的和民族的叛变扑灭了革命，进行屠杀，威廉·皮克仅以身免，卡尔·李卜克内西和罗莎·卢森堡被害。
    从德国共产党成立起，威廉·皮克就是它的领导者。党派遣这位1906年就已经是不来梅市议会议员和汉撒城社会民主党书记的经过考验的工人干部参加柏林的市议会、普鲁士州议会和州参议会和国会。威廉·皮克作为德国共产党台尔曼式的党中央委员会的委员在魏玛共和国的十四年期间，通过德国工人阶级政党和工会的统一战线的建立来加强反法西斯的和平力量和阻止好战的纳粹夺取政权，贡献了他的巨大的力量和智慧。
    在伟大的社会主义十月革命的伟大榜样的感召之下，威廉·皮克曾是关于苏维埃俄罗斯真理的一个早期传播者，通过对列宁主义新认识的研究和运用他丰富了的广博的马克思主义知识，他宣扬了德国和苏联人民之间友谊的必要性。
    1928年共产国际选举威廉·皮克为书记和执行委员会委员。国际红色救济这个支援受迫害的工人及其成员的组织，任命这位无私的、永远有行动准备的无产阶级先驱战士为它的荣誉主席。德国垄断资本家、容克地主和将军在德国社会民主党领袖的反共联合执政的政策的鼓励下，把政权交给了希特勒。在法西斯残暴的黑夜里，响彻着恩斯特·台尔曼“希特勒——就是战争！”的呼声。在国会被烧前七十二小时，威廉·皮克在柏林体育宫里再一次警告，要所有反法西斯者团结起来。他在恩斯特·台尔曼被捕后，被选为德国共产党中央委员会主席。他遵照恩斯特·台尔曼的精神，为争取所有反希特勒的人的团结和拯救和平而斗争。当时，无私的工人领袖们的愿望没有实现，而急于掠夺和侵占的德国帝国主义者的利己主义和无耻却得逞了，这是我们人民的悲剧。
    在第二次世界大战爆发时，像在二十五年前一样，威廉·皮克站在德国共产党前列，不倦地进行反对帝国主义战争的斗争。为了避免德国的灾难，不论是在同社会民主党干部或同德国著名作家以及后来同被俘的国防军成员的会面中，他一直和到处都宣扬所有反法西斯者为起来反对希特勒政权进行合作这一原则。作为社会主义国际主义者，他为了人民和祖国，反对侵略战争的发动者，反对罪犯领导政府，反对总参谋部和康采恩，他向德国的男女，向战壕里的士兵和战俘们呼吁。
    光荣的苏军及其盟友击溃希特勒军队之后，争取已久的、在法西斯集中营里所起誓要达到的目的，在德国的东部实现了。作为解放工人阶级、农民和知识分子的保证，以及作为德国民族复兴的保证的统一的马克思列宁主义工人政党成立了。在威廉·皮克身上，奥古斯特·倍倍尔的德国工人运动的优良传统与德国左派和德国共产党的革命经验融为一体。威廉·皮克的不朽功勋是真正决定性地参与了1946年德国工人阶级统一的政党的建立。作为被德国社会民主党机会主义领袖们所造成的分裂的杰出的克服者和德国工人阶级统一的成功的缔造者，他将永垂于德国工人运动的青史。他卓越地参与了成立反法西斯民主党派联盟，把一切志愿于建设的力量团结在民主德国全国阵线之中。当为了回答西方国家及其波恩走卒成立西占区分裂国家而建立第一个德国和平国家时，我国人民把这位久经考验的、完美无瑕的战士、这位在品质和政治上高度成熟的社会主义者选为德意志民主共和国的元首。威廉·皮克总统的名字和工作在全世界象征着一个不同的、崭新的和更好的德国的兴起。这个国家和法西斯主义者、军国主义者、容克地主、垄断巨头以及残暴的侵略野心毫无关系。他的名字和工作为德意志民主共和国赢得了千百万朋友。
    威廉·皮克以他的高龄，还在欧洲历史转折点上作为领导人参与了德意志民主共和国的形成和发展，经历了社会主义创造人的诞生地的社会主义建设。
    威廉·皮克是有阶级觉悟的德国工人、社会主义者、革命家和爱国者的化身，他体现了我们世纪的德国反帝斗争。他以他的丰富的知识和革命的热情，以他明智的建议和具有影响的行为，永远站在为一个崭新的德国而战斗的岗位上。他来自我们人民，并在战争与和平力量的巨大战斗中作为人民所信赖的人，站在德国的和平国家最高岗位上，在他的身上聚集着道德和廉洁、漫长生活的智慧和人类伟大思想、德国民族和社会的再生的火焰。威廉·皮克的工作体现了工人阶级的力量和才能，在为和平和社会主义的斗争中去团结我国所有和平和民主的力量。一个充满斗争、饱受迫害和历尽艰辛的生命，也是一个充满光荣和胜利的生命结束了。我们在痛苦中，也为在我们之中和在我们之首有这样一个人而感到骄傲。他的鲜明的形象、他的思想和他的行为，是德国历史和国际工人运动史中永垂不朽的组成部分。
    他的榜样活着，并且鼓舞着人民，特别是青年一代。青年报答了这位慈父般的朋友的热爱，而他为青年树立了一个战士的伟大的榜样，朴素、正直、无私和不屈不挠地献身于和平、社会主义和对苏联人民的真挚的友谊。
    亲爱的朋友和同志威廉·皮克，德国人民敬仰你服务于劳动人民、社会主义和整个德国民族的英勇的一生。在你的灵柩旁，我们宣誓：如同保护我们眼珠一样保护在德意志民主共和国终于取得的多次为帝国主义和改良主义所分裂的人民和工人阶级力量的统一。
    千百万人将拿起死神从年迈的工人总统手中夺走的旗帜，举着它走向社会主义在德意志民主共和国的胜利，走向和平在全德国的胜利。
