　　Xinhua Commune's Community-Run Industries Transfer Half of Employees to Agricultural Production
　　Vigorously Promote Technical Innovation; Strengthen Labor Management; Industry Continues to Leap Forward
    (Our newspaper) Guangzhou, 20th – Will drawing labor to strengthen the agricultural front affect the leap forward of other undertakings? The example of Xinhua Commune in Hua County, Guangdong, provides a strong answer to this question.
    After Xinhua Commune drew over six hundred and fifty laborers (accounting for 51% of the industrial workforce) from community-run industries to directly participate in the agricultural production front line, it immediately launched a mass technical innovation campaign. In the past month, employees contributed over one hundred and ten suggestions. In the past, the lime factory needed forty people every day to carry limestone. Now, with the use of a "wooden winch" handcart to transport stone and a bucket to lift stone, only seven people are needed each day, which is both more efficient and safer. The transportation in the ceramics factory, brick and tile factory, and coal mine has been motorized, saving two hundred and eighty-nine laborers.
    While carrying out technical innovation, each factory and mine also improved the labor management system of "fixed personnel, fixed quotas, fixed tasks, fixed quality", and launched labor competitions, greatly increasing the enthusiasm of workers. For example, after implementing this measure, the brick and tile factory, although thirty people (more than half of the factory's employees) were transferred back to the agricultural front, its output increased. In July, 165,740 red bricks were produced, an increase of 66% compared to June. The daily output of the commune's five lime kilns also increased from 790 tons to 1,250 tons. The commune's farm tool factory adopted the "master-apprentice" method to improve technical operating skills, and implemented comprehensive utilization of lathes, with one lathe increasing its production from one type of tool to two or three types, increasing the daily output of farm tools from 27 pieces in the past to 51 pieces. The coal mine and ceramics factory, whose product quality was previously not good enough, have recently greatly improved product quality, with pure coal reaching 95%, and the percentage of qualified ceramic products increasing from 60% to 95%.

### 新华公社社办工业半数职工投入农业生产　大搞技术革新　加强劳动管理　工业持续跃进

　　新华公社社办工业半数职工投入农业生产
　　大搞技术革新　加强劳动管理　工业持续跃进
    本报广州20日电　抽调劳动力加强农业第一线，会不会影响其他事业的跃进？广东花县新华公社的事例对这个问题作了有力的回答。
    新华公社从社办工业抽出六百五十多个劳动力（占工业职工人数51％），直接参加农业生产第一线后，立即开展一个群众性的大闹技术革新运动。一个月来，职工们共献计一百一十多条。石灰厂过去每天需要四十人担石灰石，现在采用“木绞盘”手车运石和吊斗吊石后，每天只用七个人，效率既高又安全。陶瓷厂、砖瓦厂和煤矿运输实现了车子化，节约二百八十九个劳动力。
    在进行技术革新的同时，各厂、矿还健全了“定员、定额、定任务、定质量”的劳动管理制度，开展了劳动竞赛，职工劳动积极性大大提高。如砖瓦厂执行这一措施后，虽然抽调了三十人（占全厂职工一半多）回到农业战线，但产量却增加了。7月份生产红砖十六万五千七百四十块，比6月份增长66％。全社五个石灰窑日产量也从七百九十吨增加到一千二百五十吨。公社农具厂采用“师傅带徒弟”的办法，提高技术操作水平，并且实行车床综合利用，一个车床由制一种工具增加到二、三种，日产农具从过去二十七件增加到五十一件。向来产品质量不够好的煤矿和陶瓷厂，近来产品质量也大大提高，纯煤达95％，陶瓷正品率也从60％提高到95％。
