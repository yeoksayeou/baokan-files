In the past two days, the people of the capital have been hanging flags and decorations, preparing to warmly welcome President Sékou Touré of the Republic of Guinea and the Government Delegation of the Republic of Guinea led by him to our country for a friendly visit.

President Sékou Touré and other distinguished Guinean guests are scheduled to arrive in our country on the 10th for a formal visit. Along the road from the guesthouse to the East Suburb Airport, tall painted screens have been erected. Two of the screens feature huge color portraits of President Sékou Touré. On a large painted screen facing the airport on the side of the East Suburb Road, three children are depicted holding up bouquets of bright flowers, with the golden words "President Sékou Touré, Welcome!" above the image.

The streets that the Guinean dignitaries will pass through have been decorated colorfully, presenting a festive scene. The utility poles and lampposts along the roads are adorned with the national flags of the People's Republic of China and the red, yellow, and green flags of the Republic of Guinea side by side. Above the wide Chang'an Avenue, colorful flags and banners are hung, and from afar, the avenue between the lush green roadside trees has been transformed into a colorful and splendid corridor. Many huge slogans express the Chinese people's warm welcome to President Sékou Touré, their deep friendship and respect for the heroic people of Guinea. At present, the people of the capital are eagerly awaiting the arrival of the envoys of the Guinean people, who have traveled thousands of miles.

    首都热烈准备欢迎杜尔总统
    新华社9日讯　这两天来，首都人民悬旗结彩，准备隆重热烈地欢迎几内亚共和国总统塞古·杜尔和由他率领的几内亚共和国政府代表团来我国进行友好访问。
    塞古·杜尔总统和其他几内亚贵宾预定10日来我国作正式访问。在由宾馆通往东郊机场的大路上高竖画屏，有两幅画屏上画着塞古·杜尔总统的巨幅彩色画像。在东郊马路旁一幅面向飞机场的大画屏上，画着三个高举鲜艳花束的儿童，画面的上方挂着几个金色大字：“塞古·杜尔总统，欢迎你！”
    在几内亚贵宾所要经过的街道上已经装饰得五彩缤纷，呈现节日般的景象。道路两旁的电线杆和路灯的灯柱上，都并排插起了中华人民共和国国旗和红黄绿三色的几内亚共和国国旗。宽阔的东西长安大街的上空，挂着彩旗和横幅，远远望去，翠绿的行道树之间的大街变成了彩色绚烂的通道。许多巨大的标语表达了中国人民对塞古·杜尔总统的热烈欢迎，对英雄的几内亚人民的深厚友谊和敬意。现在，首都人民正殷切等候经过万水千山的几内亚人民的使者们的到来。
