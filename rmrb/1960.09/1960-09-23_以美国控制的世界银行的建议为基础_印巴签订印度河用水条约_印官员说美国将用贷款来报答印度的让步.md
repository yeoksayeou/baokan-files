　　Xinhua News Agency, Karachi, 21st: India and Pakistan signed the "Indus Waters Treaty" in Karachi on the 19th.
　　According to the Indian Information Bureau, Indian Prime Minister Nehru arrived in Karachi on the 19th and signed the treaty with President Ayub at the Presidential Palace that evening.
　　Also signing the treaty was Mr. Iliff, Vice President of the World Bank, which is controlled by the United States.
　　That evening, three other agreements related to the Indus Waters Treaty were also signed—the Indus Basin Development Fund Agreement, the Pakistan and World Bank Loan Agreement, and the Pakistan and U.S. Development Loan Fund Loan Agreement.
　　According to the Indian Information Bureau, the Indus Waters Treaty is mainly based on the recommendations made by the World Bank in February 1954. According to this treaty, India will receive only 20% of the total flow of the Indus River system, and the other 80% will be given to Pakistan. In addition, India has agreed to provide Pakistan with $174 million in funds for the construction of connecting canals during a ten-year transition period.
　　In order to bring about the implementation of the World Bank's plan by India and Pakistan, the United States, Britain, and other countries, as well as the World Bank, have agreed to provide large loans for the construction of Indus River irrigation projects. According to the Indus Basin Development Fund Agreement, the United States, Britain, West Germany, and three other countries will contribute a total of $640 million, and another $80 million will be taken from the World Bank's loan to Pakistan. The Indus River project plan requires a total of $1.07 billion, of which $870 million is for Pakistan and $200 million for India.
　　An Indian official spokesman said on the 19th that India had made "considerable sacrifices" in the agreements signed. As a reward for these concessions, the United States has agreed to lend India 157 million rupees, and the World Bank will lend 110 million rupees to pay for the foreign exchange costs of the Bias Dam.
　　The river water dispute between India and Pakistan has lasted for twelve years. Due to the partition of India and Pakistan in 1947, the irrigation system of the Indus River and its tributaries was unreasonably divided, with the main irrigation areas in Pakistan, but the water sources came from Kashmir and the Punjab region of India. The two sides often have disputes over the use of river water.

### 以美国控制的世界银行的建议为基础　印巴签订印度河用水条约  印官员说美国将用贷款来报答印度的让步

　  以美国控制的世界银行的建议为基础
　　印巴签订印度河用水条约
　  印官员说美国将用贷款来报答印度的让步
    据新华社21日讯　卡拉奇消息：印度和巴基斯坦19日在卡拉奇签订了关于“印度河用水条约”。
    据印度新闻处报道，印度总理尼赫鲁是19日到达卡拉奇的，当晚就在巴基斯坦总统府同阿尤布总统签署了这项条约。
    在条约上签字的还有美国控制的世界银行副行长伊里夫。
    当天晚上，还签订了与印度河用水条约有关的其他三项协定——印度河流域开发基金协定，巴基斯坦和世界银行贷款协定，巴基斯坦和美国开发贷款基金会贷款协定。
    据印度新闻处报道，印度河用水条约主要是以世界银行在1954年2月提出的建议为基础的。根据这项条约，印度所获水量仅占印度河水系总流量的20％，另外80％的河水将让给巴基斯坦。此外，印度还同意向巴基斯坦在十年过渡时期修建联络运河提供一亿七千四百万美元的资金。
    为了撮合印、巴实行世界银行的方案，美、英等国和世界银行同意为修建印度河灌溉工程提供大批贷款。根据印度河流域开发基金协定，美国、英国、西德等六国共拿出六亿四千万美元，另外从世界银行给巴基斯坦的贷款中拿出八千万美元。印度河工程计划一共需要十亿七千万美元，其中八亿七千万用于巴基斯坦，二亿用于印度。
    印度官方发言人19日说，印度在所签订的协定中作了“相当大的牺牲”。作为对这种让步的报答，美国同意贷款给印度一亿五千七百万卢比，世界银行贷给一亿一千万卢比来支付比阿斯水坝的外汇费用。
    印巴两国的河水争端已经延续了十二年之久。1947年由于印巴分治，印度河和它的支流的灌溉系统被不合理的割裂开来，主要的灌溉区在巴基斯坦，但水源来自克什米尔和印度的旁遮普邦。双方对利用河水问题经常发生争执。
