Xinhua News Agency, Prague, September 15th: The Secretariat of the World Federation of Trade Unions today issued an appeal to workers of the world on the occasion of the 15th anniversary of the founding of the World Federation of Trade Unions this October.

The appeal to workers of the world stated that fifteen years ago, the World Federation of Trade Unions, the powerful international working-class trade union center, was established in Paris, uniting all trade unions and workers from capitalist, socialist, and colonial countries under the banner of international worker solidarity for the first time. Its establishment was the culmination of years of struggle and sacrifice to smash fascism and German and Japanese militarism, and to fight for democracy, social progress, and peace. Despite attacks by monopoly capitalists and the regrettable split in 1949, the continuous strengthening of its ranks and the expansion of its activities and influence prove that it has always been in line with the innermost hopes of the working class.

The appeal to workers of the world said that on the 15th anniversary of its founding, the World Federation of Trade Unions happily and proudly congratulates the workers of the Soviet Union, China, and other socialist countries, who are moving from victory to victory in the process of building a prosperous, free, and happy socialist society, on their great achievements in the economic, social, and scientific fields and on their invaluable contributions to the cause of peace. It congratulates the people of Algeria, Japan, Cuba, and the countries of Asia, Africa, and Latin America, whose admirable struggles and remarkable achievements over the past fifteen years have tolled the death knell for the colonial system and made imperialism untenable. It praises the vigorous joint struggles that have developed increasingly in all capitalist countries over the past fifteen years against the exploitation of monopoly capital, to defend and improve living and working conditions, and to fight for trade union rights and democratic freedoms. It praises the unremitting struggles of workers and people of all countries to ease international tensions and strive for national independence, disarmament, and peace.

The appeal to workers of the world continued, but it must also be pointed out that only fifteen years after the defeat of Hitlerism, Western countries, particularly U.S. imperialism, have violated all agreements signed in Potsdam, refused to conclude a peace treaty with Germany, and have criminally helped West Germany to rearm, allowing revanchists and militarist forces that threaten peace in Europe and the world to make a comeback. It must also be pointed out that only fifteen years after the end of World War II and the criminal bombing of Hiroshima, the provocations and atomic armament policies of U.S. imperialists, their deliberate support for Japanese militarism, their aggressive actions against the People's Republic of China, and their attacks on the Cuban people are a grave threat to peace and an obstacle to the desire of workers and people of all countries to ease international tensions, disarm, and coexist peacefully.

The appeal to workers of the world also pointed out that colonial countries, with the support of U.S. imperialism, are waging a bloody war against the Algerian people and attempting to destroy the independence of the Congolese people. Throughout the capitalist world, the social achievements of workers are constantly being jeopardized, trade union rights are frequently violated, and the living and working conditions of workers and their occupations are precarious and increasingly threatened.

The World Federation of Trade Unions finally called on workers all over the world to hold high the banner of working-class unity and international solidarity, calling on them to unite and take action to fight for higher wages and shorter working hours, defend trade union and democratic rights, strengthen peace and force disarmament, ban nuclear weapons and achieve peaceful coexistence, oppose the atomic armament and militarism of the West German Bundeswehr, strive for the abolition of the U.S.-Japan military treaty, and once and for all eradicate colonialism in Algeria, the Congo, and wherever colonialism exists, oppose imperialism, defend the independence of all peoples, and defend the democratic achievements of the workers and people of Cuba.

    世界工联就成立十五周年发表文告
    号召各国工人团结一致采取行动
    指出美帝国主义的战争政策和侵略政策是对和平的严重威胁  要求根除殖民主义反对帝国主义保卫和平和各国人民的独立
    新华社布拉格15日电　世界工会联合会书记处今天就今年10月世界工联成立十五周年发表了告世界工人书。
      告世界工人书中说，十五年前，强大的国际工人阶级的工会中心世界工会联合会在巴黎成立，第一次在国际工人团结的旗帜下把资本主义国家、社会主义国家和殖民地国家所有的工会和工人团结起来。它的成立是多年来为粉碎法西斯主义和德、日军国主义以及争取民主、社会进步和和平的斗争和牺牲的高潮。尽管遭到垄断资本家的进攻，尽管在1949年发生了令人遗憾的分裂，但是它的队伍的不断增强，它的活动和影响的扩大证明了它是始终符合工人阶级的内心希望的。
    告世界工人书说，世界工联在成立十五周年的时候，愉快而自豪地祝贺在建立繁荣、自由和幸福的社会主义社会的过程中从胜利走向胜利的苏联、中国和其它社会主义国家的工人在经济、社会和科学方面的伟大成就对和平事业作出的难以估价的贡献。它向阿尔及利亚、日本、古巴以及亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲国家的人民表示祝贺，十五年来，他们的令人钦佩的斗争和显著的成就，对殖民主义制度敲起了丧钟，使帝国主义站不住脚。它赞扬十五年来在所有的资本主义国家中日益发展的、反对垄断资本剥削、保卫和改善生活和工作条件、争取工会权利和民主自由的强有力的联合斗争。它赞扬工人们和各国人民为缓和国际紧张局势、争取民族独立、裁军与和平而进行的不懈的斗争。
    告世界工人书接着说，但是也必须指出，在击败希特勒主义之后仅仅十五年，西方国家，特别是美帝国主义，破坏了在波茨坦签订的一切协定，拒绝缔结对德和约，并且罪恶地帮助西德重新武装，使复仇主义者和威胁着欧洲和世界和平的军国主义势力卷土重来。还必须指出，在第二次世界大战结束和广岛遭受罪恶轰炸以后仅仅十五年，美帝国主义者的挑衅和原子武装政策，他们对日本军国主义的蓄意支持，他们对中华人民共和国的侵略行动以及他们对古巴人民的攻击是对和平的严重威胁，是对工人和各国人民要求缓和国际紧张局势、裁军和和平共处的愿望的障碍。
    告世界工人书还指出，殖民国家在美帝国主义的支持下，正在对阿尔及利亚人民进行血腥战争，并企图摧毁刚果人民的独立。在整个资本主义世界里，工人的社会成就不断受到危害，工会权利经常受到侵犯，工人的生活和工作条件和他们的职业朝不保夕，而且逐渐遭受威胁。
    世界工联最后号召全世界的工人高高举起工人阶级团结一致和国际团结的旗帜，呼吁他们团结一致采取行动，来争取提高工资和削减工作时数，保卫工会和民主权利，加强和平并强使实行裁军、禁止核武器和和平共处，反对西德国防军的原子武装和军国主义，争取废除日美军事条约，一劳永逸地在阿尔及利亚、刚果以及凡是存在殖民主义的地方根除殖民主义，反对帝国主义，保卫各国人民的独立，保卫古巴工人和人民的民主成就。
