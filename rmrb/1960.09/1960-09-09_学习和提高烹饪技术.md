    Learning and Improving Cooking Skills
    Ke Qin
    The State Council机关事务管理局 (Government Offices Administration Bureau) Cooking School has opened. This is a cause for celebration.
    The cooking school is a newly established, new type of socialist vocational school, a school for cultivating successors to the cooking profession who are both red and expert. It was founded in the spirit of "running schools diligently and thriftily." China's culinary work has a long historical tradition and unique style, and various regions have created many excellent cooking techniques, which need to be collected, organized, and improved. Many older generation culinary workers have high culinary skills and very rich experience. It is necessary to systematically inherit and carry forward their experience, so that culinary work can better serve the people's lives and better serve the cause of socialist construction.
    Culinary work is an indispensable part of the people's lives. With the continuous development of production, the people's living standards will gradually improve, and improving the people's lives will promote further development of production. The task of culinary work is to cook for people, ensuring that they eat their fill, eat well, eat economically, and eat cleanly and hygienically. Therefore, it has a great relationship with people's lives and production. After the collectivization of people's lives, culinary work is more closely related to the entire socialist construction cause. Therefore, the labor of culinary workers is a very meaningful and glorious labor. The students of the cooking school and all those engaged in culinary work should recognize the significance of their work, love this career, and wholeheartedly serve the people in their culinary work posts.
    Culinary work is a highly technical work, and it is a most practical knowledge. For example, cooking is very particular. Radishes and cabbage can be boiled or stewed, but they can also be transformed in countless ways, creating a variety of delicious and different varieties. Another example is burning a fire. To burn it well, burn it vigorously, burn it fuel-efficiently, and also burn it without dust, keeping the kitchen clean, what kind of fire is needed at what time, and what kind of fire is needed for what kind of dish, you must ensure what kind of fire is available, and there is a lot of knowledge in this. For example, food should be made economically, in accordance with hygiene conditions, and with the necessary nutritional content, and attention should also be paid to color, aroma, taste, etc., all of which are particular. The students of the cooking school should strive to learn the knowledge of culinary business while improving their political and ideological awareness, and truly learn the knowledge of culinary work; and other people engaged in culinary work should also study hard in their labor practice and accumulate experience bit by bit, so as to do a better job in culinary work.
    As this cooking school opens, we wish the students success in their studies, and at the same time hope that all those engaged in cooking work will also continue to study and improve their cooking skills in their work.

    学习和提高烹饪技术
    克勤
    国务院机关事务管理局烹饪学校开学了。这是一件值得庆贺的好事。
    烹饪学校是一座初创的、新型的社会主义的专业学校，是一个培养又红又专的烹饪工作接班人的学校。它是本着“勤俭办学”的精神创办起来的。我国的烹饪工作有着悠久的历史传统和独特的风格，各地都创造了不少很好的烹饪技术，这些技术需要收集、整理和提高。许多老一辈的烹饪工作者，烹饪技能很高，经验非常丰富，需要系统地继承并发扬他们的经验，使烹饪工作更好地为人民生活服务，更好地为社会主义建设事业服务。
    烹饪工作是人民群众生活当中必不可少的一项工作。随着生产的不断发展，人民生活水平必将逐步提高，而搞好人民群众的生活，就能够促进生产的进一步发展。烹饪工作的任务，就是为人们做饭做菜，保证人们吃得饱，吃得好，吃得省，吃得干净卫生。所以它和人们的生活和生产关系很大。人们生活集体化以后，烹饪工作和整个社会主义建设事业更加息息相关，更加密切地联系在一起。因此，烹饪工作者的劳动是一种很有意义的光荣的劳动。烹饪学校的学员以及所有从事烹饪工作的人，都应该认识到自己工作的意义，热爱这项事业，忠心耿耿地在烹饪工作岗位上为人民服务。
    烹饪工作是一项技术性相当强的工作，是一门最实际的学问。比如做菜，就大有考究，萝卜白菜可以是煮萝卜、熬白菜，也可以千变万化，制作出多种多样美味可口的不同品种；再比如烧火，要烧得好，烧得旺，烧得省煤，还要烧得没有灰尘，保持厨房清洁，什么时候要有什么样的火，做什么菜需要什么样的火，就要保证有什么样的火，这里面也大有学问。又比如饭菜要做得节省，做得合乎卫生条件，又要有必要的营养量，还要讲究色、香、味等等，都是有考究的。烹饪学校的学员们，应该在提高政治思想觉悟的同时，努力学习有关烹饪业务的知识，真正学到烹饪工作的学问；而其它从事烹饪工作的人，也应该在劳动实践中，好好钻研，一点一滴的积累经验，以便把烹饪工作做得更好。
    在这烹饪学校开学的时候，我们预祝学员们学习成功，同时希望所有从事烹饪工作的人们，也不断地在工作中学习，提高烹饪技术。
