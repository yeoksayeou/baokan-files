Xinhua News Agency, Sofia, 6th September: Bulgarian working people are actively overfulfilling production plans to greet the 16th anniversary of Bulgarian National Day (September 9th).

The entire staff of the largest hydroelectric power station in Bulgaria, the Batak Hydroelectric Power Station, located in the Rhodope Mountains in southern Bulgaria, completed their annual production plan by the end of July. To celebrate National Day, they pledged to produce 22 million kilowatt-hours of electricity for the country from the beginning of August to September 9th. By the end of August, they had already exceeded the annual plan by producing approximately 18 million kilowatt-hours more for the country. The entire staff of the Kazanluk Power Station has already completed the production plan for the first nine months of this year. As of August 24th, they had produced five million kilowatt-hours more than the original nine-month plan.

The workers of the Maritsa coal region in Dimitrovgrad, one of the most important coal-producing areas in the country, mined 11,612 tons more coal in the first eighteen days of August than originally planned. The miners of the Merizleri mine in this mining area mined an average of 200 tons more coal per day than originally planned. The workers of the Slavi Koleff production team of the Merizleri mine once pledged to mine an average of 4,487 kilograms of coal per person per day. They have now exceeded this pledge, with an average daily output of 5,417 kilograms per person.

The workers of the Kristal glass factory in Dimitrovo State have already produced 3,524,400 leva worth of products more than originally planned in the first seven months of this year. To greet National Day, they also proposed to over-produce another 4,150,000 leva worth of products by the end of the year. The workers of the Vasil Kolarov glass factory in Sliven State pledged at the beginning of this year to over-produce 322,000 leva worth of products for the country throughout the year. However, encouraged by the slogan "Greeting National Day," by August 24th, the factory's workers had already over-produced 2,261,000 leva worth of products.

In the Bulgarian countryside, the broad masses of agricultural cooperative members are stepping up the production of silage and actively preparing for autumn plowing and harvesting to greet National Day. As of September 2nd, 42.2% of the national task of producing 8 million tons of silage has been completed.

Xinhua News Agency, Sofia, September 7th: Bulgaria's cultural publishing industry has achieved continuous development on the basis of production development.

Reading rooms, which have a historical tradition in Bulgaria, have greatly developed since liberation. Before liberation, during the decades of capitalist rule, only 485 reading rooms were built nationwide. In the sixteen years since liberation, 600 have been built and another 750 are under construction. At present, the country's reading rooms have more than 7.5 million books, more than two and a half times more than in the past.

Book publishing and newspaper circulation continue to increase. Before liberation, in 1939, only 2,169 kinds of books were published nationwide, totaling 6,484,400 copies.

The country also publishes 147 kinds of magazines, with a circulation of 21,354,000 copies.

The film industry has also made progress in Bulgaria. Last year, the average citizen watched thirteen films in a year, that is, cinemas across the country received 101 million viewers in the past year. There were only 165 cinemas nationwide when it was liberated in 1944, and they were mainly in cities; now the number of cinemas has increased to 1,400, of which 1,178 are in rural areas.

Bulgarian working people love art and song and dance. At present, there are about 14,000 various amateur drama and song and dance groups nationwide, with 440,000 members.

    保加利亚很多厂矿超额完成生产计划
    新华社索非亚6日电　保加利亚劳动人民纷纷以提前完成生产计划的实际行动，迎接保加利亚国庆十六周年（9月9日）。
    位于保加利亚南部罗多彼山中的全国最大的水电站——巴塔克水电站的全体职工，在7月底就提前完成了今年全年的生产计划。为了迎接国庆节，他们提出保证：要从8月初到9月9日为国家生产两千二百万度电。但是到8月底，他们已经超过全年计划为国家多生产了约一千八百万度电。卡赞利克市发电站的全体职工，已经提前完成了今年头九个月的生产计划。截至8月24日为止，他们比原定九个月的计划多生产了五百万度电。
    全国重要产煤区之一——季米特洛夫格勒市的马里查煤区的职工们，在8月份头十八天里开采的煤比原计划多一万一千六百一十二吨。这个矿区的麦里兹列里矿井的矿工们平均每天都比原计划多开采二百吨煤。麦里兹列里矿井的斯拉维·科列夫生产队的工人们曾经提出平均每人每天采煤四千四百八十七公斤的保证。现在他们已经超额实现了这个保证。平均每人每天的采煤量达到五千四百一十七公斤。

    新华社索非亚7日电　保加利亚的文化出版事业在生产发展的基础上获得了不断的发展。
    在保加利亚具有历史传统的读书室在解放后有了很大发展。解放前，在资本主义制度统治数十年期间，全国只修建了四百八十五个读书室；解放后十六年来，就修建了六百个，另有七百五十个正在修建中。目前，全国读书室拥有七百五十万册以上的书籍，比过去多两倍半以上。
