    Strive to Complete the Production Task of Fertilizer Equipment Ahead of Schedule
    Fertilizer is the food of crops. At present, our country mainly and universally uses natural fertilizers. Although the amount of chemical fertilizers used has been increasing year by year, it is still far from meeting the needs of agricultural production for chemical fertilizers. Therefore, vigorously developing the chemical fertilizer industry is an important task for industry to support agriculture. To develop the chemical fertilizer industry, it is necessary to add a certain amount of equipment for the production of chemical fertilizers. Therefore, rushing to manufacture chemical fertilizer industrial equipment to support the development of chemical fertilizer production has become an important aspect of the current mechanical manufacturing sector's task of supporting agriculture.
    Rushing to manufacture fertilizer equipment and striving to put fertilizer equipment into production ahead of schedule is of urgent and important significance. For example, striving to put a small fertilizer plant equipment with an annual output of 800 tons of synthetic ammonia into production one day earlier can provide chemical fertilizers that can meet the current topdressing needs of two medium-sized production teams; if a set of large-scale synthetic ammonia equipment with 25,000 tons is manufactured ahead of schedule and put into production one day earlier, the chemical fertilizers provided to agriculture can solve the fertilizer needed by four to five medium-sized people's communes to ensure current production increase. According to estimates, such a set of large-scale fertilizer equipment, if it plays its role, can increase grain production by 600 million catties per year. At the same time, it also has significant effects and significance in saving labor. If half of the current farm manure is replaced by mechanized chemical fertilizers, an ordinary county with 150,000 agricultural laborers can save 15,000 to 20,000 laborers, which can be used in other places in agricultural production where labor is urgently needed. The strengthening of manpower in these places can also promote the increase in the production of grain and other crops. It can be seen that rushing to manufacture fertilizer equipment and developing the fertilizer industry has a significant role in promoting agricultural production increase.
    Whether the production of fertilizer equipment can be completed on schedule and ahead of schedule depends on whether there is sufficient attention to this task, whether a decision has been made, and whether sufficient specific measures have been taken. Although the conditions are generally the same, why is the production of fertilizer equipment progressing faster and better in some regions and enterprises, while it is progressing slower and worse in a few other regions and enterprises? The problem is obvious: whether this task has been placed in an important position and whether it has been listed as a key point for priority manufacturing. Only by attaching importance to it can we solve existing problems as soon as possible, use the strength of all parties, and mobilize the masses to overcome difficulties, thereby speeding up the progress of production. Conversely, if the importance and urgency of it are not fully understood, leadership will be relaxed, and it will be hindered by some difficulties that are not insurmountable, thereby delaying the progress of production.
    There are some characteristics in the production of fertilizer equipment. Fully estimating and understanding it, grasping it, and strengthening leadership according to its characteristics can effectively promote the progress of production. One of the characteristics of fertilizer equipment is that it is relatively complex in structure and has high requirements for complete sets. A set of fertilizer equipment includes various types of containers, various mechanical products, and general supporting products, as many as 20 to 70 items, which need to be manufactured collaboratively by several or even dozens of enterprises. This feature brings many complex problems to production organization. The relevant competent departments should immediately conduct an in-depth inspection of the production progress of fertilizer equipment. Not only should the main engine be included in the plan, but also auxiliary machines and supporting products should be arranged as early as possible, so that no product or accessory is omitted, so that the production of all contracting factories is connected and aligned. On the basis of unified understanding and cooperation, they should supervise each other and advance together. An important condition for striving to put fertilizer equipment into production ahead of schedule is that the production organization work must be meticulous and down-to-earth. Not only should the tasks be implemented at all levels when arranging production, but also the production conditions should be specifically checked, specific measures should be formulated, and the progress should be checked regularly. Special personnel should be responsible for solving the existing problems. For prominent weak links, such as the head required for high-pressure reaction cylinders, efforts should be concentrated to effectively solve them; units undertaking general and supporting products should prioritize meeting the needs of fertilizer equipment on schedule and in quantity. Only by doing these tasks meticulously and practically can we guarantee the completion of the task of fertilizer equipment on schedule and in complete sets, and strive to complete it ahead of schedule.
    When manufacturing fertilizer equipment, it is also necessary to master its production technical requirements and strictly guarantee quality. The use and operation of fertilizer equipment is different from general mechanical products. It must not only play the role of general machinery, but also undertake the chemical reaction process carried out at high temperature and high pressure. Whether a set of fertilizer equipment can produce high-quality products after it leaves the factory is related to the century-old plan of a fertilizer plant's production. In the past few years, various places have gained a lot of experience in the manufacture of fertilizer equipment, but at present, there are only a few professional and semi-professional production plants, and most of them are newly undertaking this task. Therefore, in the manufacturing process, it is necessary to mobilize the masses to learn and master the existing advanced experience, pay close attention to quality, and strictly guarantee quality.
    Fertilizer equipment also has some characteristics in terms of material requirements. The quantity is large, the variety and specifications are diverse, and auxiliary materials even include enameled porcelain, flannel, etc. Therefore, the material preparation work is more complicated. At present, it is particularly necessary to seize the opportunity to solve several key metal materials. Shanghai has recently achieved great results by mobilizing the potential of various material resources and allocating and using materials, which is a feasible and good experience. In solving the material problem, the masses should be fully mobilized, and especially through the in-depth development of the technical innovation and technical revolution movement, key materials should be saved and reliable substitute materials should be found.
    At present, there are many favorable conditions for rushing to manufacture fertilizer equipment. In the past year or so, some regions and enterprises have basically mastered its manufacturing technology; in the past six months, a large number of parts and components have been produced. As long as we seize the work of completing the sets, we can quickly produce complete sets of products. Under the leadership of the Party committees at all levels in various places, the machinery industry department should seize the opportunity, combine it with the mass movement of increasing production and practicing economy, and strive to transport more and better complete sets of fertilizer equipment to the fertilizer production front ahead of schedule.

    力争提前完成化肥设备的生产任务
    肥料是农作物的粮食。目前我国大量、普遍采用的是自然肥料，化学肥料的采用量虽然逐年有所增加，但是和农业生产发展对于化学肥料的需要相比，还是很不够的。因此，大力发展化学肥料工业是工业支援农业的一个重要任务。而要发展化肥工业，又必须要增添一定数量的化肥生产的设备，因而赶制化肥工业的设备，支援化学肥料生产的发展，又成为当前机械制造部门支援农业任务的一个重要方面。
    赶制化肥设备，力争化肥设备提前投入生产，有很迫切的重要意义。如争取将一套年产八百吨合成氨的小型化肥厂设备，早投入生产一天，为农业提供的化学肥料，约可满足两个中等规模生产大队当前追肥的需要；如果提前赶制出来一套两万五千吨的大型合成氨设备，早投入生产一天，为农业提供的化学肥料，可以解决四个到五个中等规模人民公社保证当前增产所需要的肥料。据估算，这样一套大型化肥设备，发挥它的作用，每年可以增产粮食六亿斤。同时，在节约劳力方面也有重大的作用和意义。如果把目前农家肥料的一半用机制化学肥料来代替，一个拥有十五万农业劳动力的普通的县，就可以节约出一万五千个到两万个劳动力，用到农业生产其它迫切需要劳动力的地方去。这些地方的人力加强了，又可以促进粮食和其它农作物的增产。可见赶制化肥设备，发展化肥工业，对促进农业增产有着多么重大的作用。
    化肥设备的生产能不能按期和提前完成，关键在于对这项任务是否有足够的重视，是不是下了决心和采取足够的具体措施。虽然条件大体相同，为什么化肥设备的生产在有些地区和企业就进展较快、较好，而在另外少数地区和企业就进展较慢、较差呢？问题很明显，在于是否把这项任务排到了重要的地位，是否已列为优先制造的重点。重视它，才能够尽快和尽早地解决存在的问题，运用四面八方的力量，发动群众克服困难，从而加快生产的进度。反之，如果对它的重要性和迫切意义认识不足，就会放松领导，就会被一些并非不可克服的困难绊住，从而延缓了生产进度。
    化肥设备生产是有一些特点的，充分估计和认识它，掌握它，针对它的特点来加强领导，就能有力地推动生产的进展。化肥设备的一个特点是构成比较复杂，成套性要求高。一套化肥设备包括各式容器，各种机械产品和通用配套产品达二十到七十项之多，要由几个以至几十个企业协作制造。这个特点，给生产组织工作带来许多复杂的问题。有关的主管部门应当立即对化肥设备的生产进度深入地进行一次检查，不仅要把主机纳入计划，而且辅机和配套产品也要早早安排，做到不遗漏一项产品、一种配件，使所有承制工厂的生产都接上头、对上缝，在统一认识、通力合作的基础上，互相督促，齐头并进。力争化肥设备提前投入生产的一个重要条件是生产组织工作必须细致、踏实。不仅在安排生产时，任务要层层落实，而且要具体查对生产条件，订出具体措施，并经常检查进度。对存在的问题都要有专人负责解决。对突出的薄弱环节，如高压反应筒所需封头等，要集中力量切实解决；承担通用、配套产品的单位，应当做到按期、如数地优先满足化肥设备的需要。只有这样，细致踏实地把这些工作做好，才能保证按期、成套地完成化肥设备的任务，并力争提前完成。
    制造化肥设备，还必须掌握它生产技术上的要求，严格保证质量。化肥设备在使用与操作上与一般机械产品不同，不但要发挥一般机械的作用，而且要承担在高温、高压下所进行的化学反应过程。一套化肥设备出厂以后，能否生产出质量优良的产品来，是关系到一个化肥厂生产的百年大计。几年来各地在化肥设备制造上，虽已取得了不少的经验，但是目前专业和半专业的生产厂还只是少数，大多还是新承担这项任务，因而在制造过程中，必须发动群众学习掌握已有的先进经验，切实注意质量，严格保证质量。
    化肥设备在材料的需求上也有一些特点。数量大，品种规格多，辅助材料中甚至还包括搪磁、呢绒等等，因而材料准备工作比较复杂。当前特别要抓紧解决几种关键性的金属材料。上海市最近通过动员各方面物资潜力，调剂使用材料，取得很大成果，是一条可行的好经验。在解决材料问题中，应当充分发动群众，特别要通过技术革新与技术革命运动的深入开展，节约关键材料和寻找可靠的代用材料。
    目前赶制化肥设备有许多有利条件。一年多来，有些地区和企业已经基本掌握了它的制造技术；半年以来，已经生产了大量的零件部件，只要抓紧配套工作，就能迅速地生产出成套产品来。机械工业部门要在各地各级党委领导下，抓紧时机，结合群众性的增产节约运动，力争提前把更多更好的成套化肥设备输送到化肥生产战线去。
