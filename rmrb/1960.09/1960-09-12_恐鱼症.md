Poetry and Painting Combination

    Ichthyophobia	Poem by Fu Shi, Painting by Fang Cheng
    —British "Labour Monthly" August issue reprinted a short message from the "Vancouver Sun": Goldfish and tropical fish grown in Hong Kong must now have visas—special permits stating that they were not grown in "Communist China" in order to enter the United States.

    Where were you born?
    Where did you grow up?
    Goldfish, you are scarlet, golden and yellow,
    Clearly disguised as an Eastern dragon!
    Tropical fish, your name carries heat,
    Sufficient proof that you are also Communist!
    Quick, block the door!
    Don't allow them to come to America and expand their influence.
    A single blade of grass from People's China,
    Can collapse a thousand beams in the White House!
    Moreover, the fish are still alive,
    Wouldn't they turn America into mush!
    What? They were indeed born in Hong Kong,
    Not from the red mainland?
    But, its color is so red,
    How can I put my mind at ease!
    Alright, visa! Sign here!
    Write a guarantee for them!

    恐鱼症	俯拾诗  方成画
    ——英国《劳动月刊》8月份转载《温哥华太阳报》短讯：在香港生长的金鱼和热带鱼，现在必须签证——有特别许可证，表明它们不是在“共产党中国”生长的，才能进入美国。
    你在哪里生？
    你在哪里长？
    金鱼你赤红金星黄，
    分明是东方巨龙的化装！
    热带鱼你名字还带热，
    足证你也是共产党！
    快堵上门！
    不许它们到美国扩大影响。
    人民中国一根草，
    压塌白宫千道梁！
    何况鱼还是活的哩，
    岂不要把美国搞成浆！
    什么？它们确实生在香港，
    不是来自红色大陆上？
    可是，它的颜色那么红，
    怎能叫我把心放！
    好吧，签证！画押！
    替它们写下保单一张！
