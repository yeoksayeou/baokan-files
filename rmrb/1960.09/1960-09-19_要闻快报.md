    Shanxi Sends Large Number of Cadres to Support "Three Autumns" Work
    The Shanxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China organized a strong rural work group, which departed on the 16th to go deep into fifty counties, including Linxian, Lishi, and Zhongyang, to help the people's communes conscientiously do a good job in the "Three Autumns" work and the procurement of agricultural and sideline products.
    The rural work group, composed of more than 2,500 cadres from provincial-level agencies, is divided into four regiments and fifty work teams according to region, with Tao Lujia, First Secretary of the Shanxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, Wang Qian, Secretary of the Secretariat, Wei Heng, Secretary of the Secretariat and Governor, and Chi Biqing, Secretary of the Secretariat, serving as the respective regimental commanders.
        Guizhou Seizes the Opportunity to Prepare Base Fertilizer for Autumn Planting
    While strengthening the late-stage field management of autumn-harvested crops, people's communes in Guizhou Province are seizing the current opportunity when mountain grass is lush to prepare base fertilizer for autumn planting. To date, the province has an average of 1,500 jin of base fertilizer for each mu of autumn-sown crops.
    The current fertilizer accumulation in the mountainous areas of Guizhou is mainly based on the accumulation and production of pen manure and green manure. In addition to organizing professional teams to accumulate fertilizer, people's communes are also mobilizing commune members to cut grass for livestock bedding and to compost green manure during the early morning and evening hours. Yangtou Commune in Tongren County launched a "one-stop" fertilizer accumulation campaign involving cutting, transporting, piling, composting, and collecting. 7,000 people in the commune went to the mountains to cut grass, and 1,000 people piled and composted on the dams. They also arranged cattle carts, wooden boats, and cableways to transport fertilizer, completing 51% of the original fertilizer accumulation plan in seven days.
    In order to solve the problem of insufficient labor for transporting fertilizer, many communes have adopted the method of moving cattle pens up the mountains and pig pens down to the fields, accumulating fertilizer directly in the fields.
        Anhui Has Accumulated More Than Half of the Base Fertilizer Needed for Autumn Planting
    Anhui Province has accumulated more than half of the base fertilizer needed for autumn planting, most of which is composted green manure, high-temperature compost, and human and animal manure.
    Reasonably planning and constructing fertilizer stations is an important measure for Anhui Province to accumulate and transport fertilizer with less effort and greater results. This experience was created by the suburban commune of ?shang County. Based on the distribution of crops, soil quality, fertilizer sources, distance from villages, and the principle of saving labor, they adopted the method of building field fertilizer stations near pig farms, roads, field edges, and water sources, with one composting pool for every ten mu of land, one fertilizer storage for every 500 mu of land, and one pig farm for every 1,000 mu of land. This changed the past situation where pig farms and fertilizer yards were in the villages and too far from the farmland, saving labor for transporting fertilizer. After Fuyang Prefecture promoted this experience, the entire prefecture has completed 70% of the base fertilizer required for autumn planting.
        People on Both Sides of the Han River Overcome Extraordinary Floods
    More than one million flood-fighting troops on both sides of the Han River in Hubei Province, under the leadership of flood-fighting headquarters at all levels, spent two days of intensive work to generally raise the low-lying sections of the Han River's main dike by five decimeters to about two meters, completing 3.5 million cubic meters of earthwork, and overcoming the extraordinary floods. At present, the water level of the entire river has steadily declined, and flood-fighting personnel have been discharged from the dikes in batches, with a small number of remaining laborers still patrolling and guarding vigilantly.
    Since September 2, continuous heavy rains have fallen in the middle and upper reaches of the Han River, with rainfall reaching 200 to 300 millimeters in a week. Floods from the main stream of the Han River and its tributaries erupted simultaneously, with flood flows and peak water levels exceeding the highest records of the 1958 flood season, and also the largest flood since 1935.
        Zhoushan Islands Launch Autumn Fishing Competition
    Under the slogan of striving for an autumn fishing season that surpasses the summer fishing season, the communes of the Zhoushan Islands in Zhejiang are enthusiastically launching an autumn fishing competition. The broad masses of commune members are driving thousands of fishing boats, fishing day and night in the fishing grounds, determined to increase the production of more fish and shrimp as a gift to National Day.
    The proposal to launch the competition was put forward by the nationally famous Ant People's Commune. This commune fully completed the fishery production plan for the first half of the year and won the red banner of excellence. Recently, when studying autumn fishing production, this commune proposed to all communes to launch a labor competition to make the autumn fishing season surpass the summer fishing season and the whole year surpass the plan, which was enthusiastically responded to by all communes.
        Shunjiang Commune Saves Land and Expands Grain Planting
    In the spirit of taking agriculture as the foundation and grain as the key link, Shunjiang People's Commune in Neijiang County, Sichuan Province, reasonably saves the use of cultivated land. Departments such as diversified management, commune-run industry, and basic construction at all levels above the brigade in this commune have recently actively cleared and compressed more than 3,000 mu of cultivated land and invested it in agriculture, giving priority to the development of grain production.

    要闻快报
    山西大批干部支援“三秋”工作
    中共山西省委组织了强大的农村工作团，于16日出发，分别深入到临县、离石、中阳等五十个县，帮助人民公社认真做好“三秋”工作和农副产品的收购工作。
    农村工作团，由省级各机关二千五百多名干部组成，按地区分为四个团、五十个工作队，由中共山西省委第一书记陶鲁笳，书记处书记王谦，书记处书记、省长卫恒，书记处书记池必卿分别担任团长。
        贵州抓紧时机准备秋种底肥
    贵州省各人民公社在加强秋收作物后期田间管理的同时，抓紧当前山草茂密时机为秋种准备底肥。到现在为止，全省平均每亩秋播作物已有底肥一千五百斤。
    贵州山区当前积肥，是以积制圈肥和沤青肥为主。各人民公社除了组织专业队伍积肥以外，还发动社员利用早晚时间割草垫圈和沤青肥。铜仁县漾头公社开展割、运、堆、沤、采“一条龙”的积肥运动，全社有七千人上山割草，一千人在坝上堆、沤，还安排了牛马车、木船和架设滑丝运肥，七天就完成了原订积肥计划的51％。
    许多公社为解决运肥劳力不足的问题，采取了牛圈上山，猪圈下田，就田积肥的办法。
        安徽已积秋种基肥一半以上
    安徽省秋种所需基肥已积了一半以上，其中大部分是经过沤制的绿肥、高温堆肥和人畜粪。
    合理布局建设肥料站，是安徽省积肥、运肥做到花力小、收效大的一项重要措施。这个经验是?上县城郊公社创造的。他们根据作物分布、土质、肥源、离庄远近的情况和节约劳力的原则，采取就猪场、就道路、就田头、就水源的办法，建成了十亩地一个沤肥池、五百亩地一个肥料库、千亩地一个养猪场的田间肥料站，改变了过去猪场、肥场在村里，距农田太远的状况，节约了运肥劳力。阜阳专区推广这一经验后，全专区秋种所需基肥已完成70％。
        汉江两岸人民战胜特大洪水
    湖北省汉江两岸一百多万名防汛大军，在各级防汛指挥部领导下，经过两天时间的突击，就把汉江干堤的低矮部分普遍加高了五分米到两米左右，完成土方三百五十万立方米，战胜了特大洪水。目前，全江水位已平稳下降，防汛人员已分批下堤，留在堤上的少数民工仍警惕地巡逻防守。
    自9月2日起，汉江中上游地区连续普降暴雨，一周内降雨量多达二百至三百多毫米。汉江干流和各支流洪水同时迸发，洪水流量和高峰水位均超过1958年汛期最高纪录，也是1935年以来最大的一次洪水。
        舟山群岛开展秋汛捕鱼竞赛
    浙江舟山群岛各公社在力争秋汛超夏汛的口号下，热烈展开秋汛捕鱼竞赛。广大社员驾驶着几千条渔船，正在渔场上日夜捕捞，决心增产更多的鱼虾，向国庆节献礼。
    开展竞赛的倡议，是全国著名的蚂蚁人民公社提出的。这个公社全面完成了上半年的渔业生产计划，获得了优胜红旗。最近，这个公社研究秋汛生产时，向各公社倡议开展秋汛超夏汛、全年超计划的劳动竞赛，各公社热烈响应。
        顺江公社节约用地扩种粮食
    四川省内江县顺江人民公社本着以农业为基础、以粮食为纲的精神，合理节约使用耕地。这个公社大队以上各级举办的多种经营、社办工业以及基本建设等部门，最近积极清理和压缩出三千多亩耕地，投入农业，优先发展粮食生产。
