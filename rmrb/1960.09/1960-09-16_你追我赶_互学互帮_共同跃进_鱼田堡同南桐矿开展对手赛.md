    This newspaper reports that the Yutianbao Coal Mine and the Nantong Coal Mine in Chongqing launched an emulation drive, competing with each other, learning from each other, and helping each other, promoting a double leap in production. Workers at the Nantong Coal Mine, who had been lagging behind in production, were inspired to catch up and surpass their competition; the workers at the Yutianbao Coal Mine were working even harder, determined to scale new heights in production.

    The equipment, technical strength, and mining conditions of Yutianbao and Nantong Coal Mines are roughly the same, making them well-matched and evenly matched. However, the production capacity of Yutianbao Coal Mine is about one-third greater than that of Nantong Coal Mine. Precisely because of this, some workers at Nantong Coal Mine lacked confidence in catching up with their opponent at the beginning of the emulation drive. In response to this ideological situation, the Nantong Coal Mine Party Committee immediately launched a large-scale debate among all mine workers, and used the vivid example of the small coal kiln of Tongxing Coal Mine in Qijiang surpassing large coal mines to illustrate that as long as one has ambition and lofty aspirations, one can definitely create miracles and catch up with and surpass advanced opponents. After a heated debate, all the mine workers were full of confidence and greatly increased their enthusiasm, thus promoting the soaring of the mine's raw coal production, with daily overproduction, quickly approaching the production level of Yutianbao Coal Mine.

    The situation of Nantong Coal Mine catching up in great strides further stimulated the production enthusiasm of the workers at Yutianbao Coal Mine. At this time, the mine Party Committee took advantage of the momentum, greatly encouraged enthusiasm, and enabled all the mine workers to raise raw coal production to a new level in one go. When the heroic deeds of twelve old miners of Nantong Coal Mine were spread to Yutianbao Coal Mine, the Yutianbao Coal Mine Party Committee immediately invited the old heroes to the mine to give reports to the workers, further inspiring the workers' ambition and revolutionary enthusiasm. When the First Mine encountered some key breakthroughs in the promotion of hydraulic coal mining, it immediately sent people to the Lu Changhua hydraulic mining team of Nantong Coal Mine to learn from their experience, so that hydraulic coal mining quickly achieved remarkable results.

    In the emulation drive of learning from Yutian, catching up with Yutian, and surpassing Yutian, the workers of Nantong Coal Mine learned from advanced examples and promoted experiences whenever they saw them. Many advanced work experiences and advanced coal mining technologies created by Yutianbao have blossomed and borne fruit after being learned and promoted by the workers of Nantong Coal Mine. After they implemented the "underground office" system created by Yutianbao Coal Mine, and the work experience of carrying out political and ideological work in the mine, in the workshops, and in the kitchen, it effectively promoted production. At the same time, Yutianbao Coal Mine further developed the spirit of communist cooperation and provided selfless assistance to Nantong Coal Mine in various aspects. When Nantong Coal Mine encountered difficulties in promoting new coal mining technologies, Yutianbao Coal Mine took the initiative to send personnel with rich technical experience to provide strong support, promoting a substantial increase in the daily output of raw coal at the workface.

### 你追我赶　互学互帮　共同跃进  鱼田堡同南桐矿开展对手赛

    你追我赶　互学互帮　共同跃进
    鱼田堡同南桐矿开展对手赛
    本报讯　重庆市鱼田堡煤矿同南桐煤矿展开了对手竞赛，你追我赶，互学互帮，促进生产双双飞跃。生产一直落在后面的南桐煤矿职工奋起直追，立志赶上和超过竞赛对手；鱼田堡煤矿职工更是劲上加劲，坚决攀登生产新高峰。
    鱼田堡和南桐煤矿的设备、技术力量和采掘条件等大体相同，可算是门当户对，势均力敌。不过，鱼田堡煤矿的生产能力比南桐煤矿约大三分之一。正因为这样，南桐煤矿部分职工在对手竞赛初期，对赶上对方有些信心不足。南桐煤矿党委针对这种思想情况，立即发动全矿职工展开了一场大辩论，并且用綦江同兴煤矿小煤窑超过大型煤矿的生动事例，说明只要树雄心，立大志，就一定能够创造奇迹，赶上和超过先进的对手。全矿职工经过热烈的辩论，信心百倍，干劲猛增，从而促进全矿原煤产量扶摇直上，日日超产，迅速接近了鱼田堡煤矿的生产水平。
    南桐煤矿生产大步追上的形势，又进一步激发了鱼田堡煤矿职工的生产积极性。这时，矿党委乘势大借东风，大鼓干劲，使全矿职工一鼓作气，把原煤生产迅速提高到一个新的水平。当南桐煤矿十二位老矿工的英雄事迹传到鱼田堡煤矿时，鱼田堡煤矿党委立即邀请老英雄到矿里来向工人作报告，进一步鼓舞了工人们的雄心壮志和革命干劲。一井在推行水力采煤方面，有些关键突不破，就立即派人到南桐煤矿陆昌华水采队取“经”，使水力采煤很快收到了显著效果。
    南桐煤矿工人在学鱼田、赶鱼田、超鱼田的对手竞赛中，见先进就学习，有经验就推广。鱼田堡创造的许多先进工作经验和先进采煤技术，经南桐煤矿职工学习和推广以后，已经开花结果。他们推行了鱼田堡煤矿创造的“井下办公”制度、政治思想工作下矿井、下工房、下厨房等工作经验以后，有力地促进了生产。与此同时，鱼田堡煤矿还进一步发扬了共产主义协作精神，在各个方面对南桐煤矿进行无私帮助。当南桐煤矿在推行新采煤技术中遇到困难时，鱼田堡煤矿就主动派出富有技术经验的人员进行有力支援，促进了工作面原煤日产量的大幅度提高。
