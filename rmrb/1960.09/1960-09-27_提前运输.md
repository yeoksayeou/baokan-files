　　Advance Transportation
    The transportation volume in Wuxi City for the fourth quarter will increase by about 50% compared to the third quarter. To ensure a substantial increase in industrial and agricultural production in the fourth quarter, the transportation department has allocated a batch of transportation vehicles specifically for advance transportation and has launched a competition of "more loading and faster running, safety and economy, no damage to goods, and high transportation to ensure high output." The Municipal Transportation Party Committee decided that the secretary and bureau director would take the lead, organizing 75% of the office cadres to go deep into the front line of production to strengthen leadership over the advance transportation work. Shi Mingxuan, Director of the Transportation Bureau, went deep into the production site of the steel plant and found that a large amount of materials was piled up on both sides of the road, which affected the plant's internal advance transportation and the storage of transported materials. Therefore, he immediately organized loading and unloading workers to clear the site in a concentrated effort, creating conditions for the plant to prepare materials. Deputy Director Xu Huang found that the loading and unloading efficiency of the timber special line was not high and the turnover of ships was slow. He worked with cadres and workers to identify the reason for the lack of coordination between production, supply, and sales. He convened metallurgy, infrastructure, highway, railway, shipping, and other departments to jointly study and implement unified command and unified scheduling, which improved loading and unloading efficiency and ship turnover rate. In order to improve advance transportation, measures of "three unifications" and "three queues" were also adopted. The "three unifications" are unified organization and distribution of goods, unified arrangement of transportation plans, and unified arrangement of transportation vehicles. The "three queues" are arranging the transportation vehicles, labor, and transported materials for the morning every morning, arranging for the afternoon at 10:00 AM, and arranging for the evening and the next morning at 4:00 PM. In this way, the dynamics of vehicles and ships were grasped, the time ships stayed in port was shortened, and the turnover rate of short-distance barges in the city was improved.
    Currently, the transportation department of this city is further strengthening vehicle and ship scheduling, closely coordinating production, supply, and sales, and striving to prepare half a month to a month's worth of materials for key units such as steel and capital construction in September.

　　提前运输
    无锡市第四季度的物资运输量将比三季度增长50％左右。为保证第四季度工农业生产大幅度增长，交通运输部门抽出一批运输工具专搞提前运输，并开展了“多装快跑、安全节约、货无损坏、高运保高产”的竞赛。市交通党委决定由书记、局长挂帅，组织75％的机关干部深入生产第一线，加强对提前运输工作的领导。交通局长施明轩深入钢铁厂生产现场，发现道路两旁堆积大批物资，既影响厂内运输提前，又影响运输物资的堆放。于是，立即组织搬运工人突击清出场地，为这个厂备料创造了条件。副局长徐璜发现木材专用线的装卸效率不高，船只周转慢，就同干部、工人一起研究，找出了产、供、销不够协调的原因，召集冶金、基建、公路、铁路、航运等部门共同研究，实行统一指挥，统一调度，提高了装卸效率和船舶周转率。为了把提前运输搞得更好，还采取了
  “三统一”和“三排队”的措施，“三统一”就是统一组织分配货源，统一安排运输计划，统一安排运输工具。“三排队”是每天早晨排好上午所用运输工具、劳动力和运送物资，上午十时排下午，下午四时排晚上及第二天早晨。这样，就掌握了车船动态，缩短了船舶留港时间，提高了市内短驳船只的周转率。
    目前，这个市的交通运输部门，正在进一步加强车船调度，密切产、供、销协作，争取在9月份为钢铁、基本建设等重点单位备足半个月到一个月的料。　（据新华社讯）
