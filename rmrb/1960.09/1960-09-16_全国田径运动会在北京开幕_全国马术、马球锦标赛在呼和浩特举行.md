Xinhua News Agency Report: The 1960 National Track and Field Games opened on the morning of the 14th at the Beijing Workers' Stadium.

This sports event gathers the best track and field athletes in the country and is a grand review of China's track and field movement following the First National Games last year. Six hundred and ninety male and female track and field athletes from thirty units are participating in the Games. In addition to the provinces, cities, and autonomous regions, the "Locomotive" Sports Association and the National "Avant-Garde" Sports Association (public security system) have sent athletes to participate. The People's Liberation Army has also sent a women's team with a relatively even level of skill to participate.

The Games will last for five days and will end on the 18th. Four hundred and ten male athletes will compete in twenty-seven events, and two hundred and eighty female athletes will compete in fifteen events. Because there are more participants, thirteen track and field events (seven for men and six for women) will first hold qualifying rounds. Athletes who pass the qualifying standards will be eligible to participate in the preliminary rounds. The qualifying standards for four of these events have been raised compared to the First National Games last year. These four events are: women's high jump 1.55 meters (1.52 meters at last year's National Games), women's javelin 38 meters (36.20 meters), women's shot put 11.50 meters (11.20 meters), and women's hand grenade 48 meters (46.85 meters).

Thanks to upholding the principle of putting politics in command and diligent practice, China's track and field athletes have achieved gratifying results this year. Not only have twenty-one people broken seventeen national records thirty-two times, and two people tied two national records three times, but also a group of outstanding newcomers has emerged. For example, Wu Fushan, a 17-year-old athlete from Beijing who passed the women's high jump qualifying standard on the morning of the 14th, recently jumped over 1.70 meters and will be a rival to Zheng Fengrong from Shandong.

In the past two days, at the National Track and Field Games, track and field newcomers from all over the country have been striving to be the best, and veterans have been racing against the clock, making the competition very fierce and creating gratifying results.

Xinhua News Agency, Hohhot: The 1960 National Equestrian and Polo Championships began on the 11th at the Hohhot Racecourse.

A total of eleven units, including Beijing, Shandong, Anhui, Xinjiang, Heilongjiang, Shanghai, Inner Mongolia, Qinghai, Jiangsu, Hebei, and the People's Liberation Army, are participating in this championship, including 296 riders from ten ethnic groups. All competitions are scheduled to end on September 25.

    全国田径运动会在北京开幕
    全国马术、马球锦标赛在呼和浩特举行
    据新华社讯　1960年全国田径运动会14日上午在北京工人体育场开幕。
    这次运动会集中了全国田径运动的好手，是继去年第一届全国运动会后，对我国田径运动的大检阅。参加运动会的有来自三十个单位的六百九十名男女田径健儿。除各省、市、自治区外，“火车头”体育协会和全国“前卫”体育协会（公安系统）都派有选手参加。解放军队也派了水平比较均匀的女子队参加。
    运动会将举行五天，到18日结束。四百一十名男运动员将在二十七个项目中较量，二百八十名女运动员将在十五个项目中角逐。由于参加比赛的选手比较多，这次有十三个男女田径项目（男七项、女六项）仍先举行及格赛，通过及格赛标准的选手才有资格参加预赛。其中有四项及格赛标准都比去年第一届全国运动会时有所提高。这四项是：女子跳高一米五十五（去年全运会是一米五十二）、女子标枪三十八米（三十六米二十）、女子铅球十一米五十（十一米二十）、女子手榴弹四十八米（四十六米八十五）。
    我国田径健儿由于坚持政治挂帅，勤学苦练，今年以来已取得可喜的收获：不仅有二十一人三十二次打破了十七项全国纪录、两人三次平了两项全国纪录，还涌现了一批成绩优异的新手。例如14日上午通过女子跳高及格赛标准的北京选手、十七岁的吴浮山不久前已跳过一米七十，将是山东郑凤荣的对手。
    两天来，在全国田径运动会上，各地田径新手力争上游，老将争分夺秒，使比赛进行得十分激烈，并创造了可喜的成绩。
    据新华社呼和浩特讯　1960年全国马术、马球锦标赛，11日在呼和浩特市赛马场开始举行。
    这次锦标赛共有北京、山东、安徽、新疆、黑龙江、上海、内蒙古、青海、江苏、河北、解放军等十一个单位参加，包括十个民族的二百九十六名骑手。全部比赛预定在9月25日结束。
