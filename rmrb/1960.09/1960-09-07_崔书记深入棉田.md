Secretary Cui Goes Deep into the Cotton Fields
By our reporter Jiang Weicai

    After studying the People's Daily editorial "Vigorously Develop Agriculture, Vigorously Develop Grain" and other related articles, Comrade Cui Lin, First Secretary of the San Cang Commune Committee of the Communist Party of China in Dongtai County, Jiangsu Province, considered many issues and decided to go deep into the fields to understand the key issues that urgently needed to be resolved in current production, and to strengthen the late-stage management of autumn fields.

    One morning, Secretary Cui first went to the No. 2 production team of the San Cang Brigade, which had good cotton growth and was rated as "upstream." Approaching the cotton field of this team, he saw cotton plants as tall as a person, with cotton bolls hanging full on the fruit branches, and the cotton leaves were lush green. These cotton plants, which had suffered from waterlogging not long ago, grew well after being cultivated by the people. Cui Lin walked along the field埂, watching as he went, unable to contain his inner joy. He held a cotton plant and counted, and generally there were ten or so bolls on each cotton plant; but at the same time, he also found that the flower buds at the top of the cotton plant were falling off more. What was the reason for this? Cui Lin took a closer look and found that the cotton plants had only been pruned, and the soil had not been loosened and the roots hilled in time, and the ventilation and light transmission were not good enough, resulting in high ground humidity and angular leaf spot disease on the cotton leaves, which affected the preservation of buds and bolls. Why only prune, but not loosen the soil and remove old leaves in time? Cui Lin thought as he walked. Seeing a group of commune members pruning in the field, he ran to the heart of the field and worked with the commune members. Cui Lin asked, "What else do you have to do after pruning?" A commune member casually replied, "There's nothing else to do!" Cui Lin asked again, "Don't you loosen the soil and remove old leaves?" Several commune members argued, "Our cotton grows well, and there's no grass in the field, why loosen the soil?" After a period of chat, Cui Lin found that the commune members had a sense of complacency. Therefore, he calculated an account with the commune members in the field. He said: If the soil is loosened and the old leaves are removed in time, and the ventilation and light transmission are good, each cotton plant can preserve at least one more flower bud and bear one more autumn boll, so that each mu of land can harvest more than 20 jin of seed cotton. After listening to Cui Lin's calculation, the commune members happily said, "Secretary Cui, your calculation has brightened our hearts. We can't relax the late-stage management at all!"

    In the afternoon, Cui Lin went to the relatively backward No. 4 production team of this brigade. In a cotton field, Cui Lin saw a dozen commune members treating leafhoppers. He found that the pest control worker sprayed the medicine like a "dragon dance," only spraying back and forth on the upper side of the cotton leaves, and the back of the cotton leaves could not be sprayed. He carefully checked several cotton plants that had been treated for pests, and the pest control rate was only about 50%. He discussed with the pest control worker to adopt the method of spraying on both sides, and the pest control rate reached more than 90%.

    After solving the pest control method, Cui Lin crossed several field ridges and inspected the cotton fields that had not yet been treated for pests, and found that some cotton fields had relatively serious pest damage. However, looking at the only five sprayers and ten pest control workers invested in pest control, he carefully calculated that one sprayer could treat five mu at the fastest in one day, then this team of 296 mu of cotton field would take more than ten days to treat the pests once, wouldn't it delay the major event? Cui Lin was very familiar with the situation of this production team. He clearly remembered that this team had nine sprayers and eighteen pest control workers, why not mobilize all of them? He also asked the production team cadres and commune members for the details. The team cadres said that the pests had been treated several times, and the few leafhoppers left in the field would not hinder the cotton production increase. Due to paralysis and slack, they put four sprayers at home and did not use them, and pulled the remaining pest control workers to do some non-urgent work.

    That night, Cui Lin also found the brigade branch secretary and convened the brigade branch committee to further analyze the ideological trends and existing problems of the party members, cadres, and masses in the late-stage management of cotton fields. However, are these problems existing in the San Cang Brigade representative? What other noteworthy problems exist in other production teams? He decided to go to the Yuejin Brigade, which had suffered more waterlogging, to see.

    The next day, Cui Lin ran to the No. 6 production team of the Yuejin Brigade and worked with the commune members. Although it had suffered more waterlogging not long ago, the growth of cotton seedlings was not inferior to last year. In the cotton fields, the commune members were pruning, topdressing, weeding, and loosening the soil, and they were very motivated. However, he also found problems: the various processes were not connected, the work efficiency was not high, and some labor was wasted. He discussed with the commune members in the field. Cui Lin asked, "Can the several agricultural tasks of pruning, topdressing, weeding, and soil loosening be combined?" Several commune members pondered for a while and said, "Secretary Cui, it can be done! Except for the pest control, which needs to be done separately, the other tasks can be done in a one-stop manner, and it can save labor if they are connected." Cui Lin immediately studied the one-stop operation method with the commune members.

    How much work efficiency can the one-stop operation method improve? Cui Lin decided to do it himself in this team. After lunch, he took the tools and went to the field with the team cadres and commune members. They were a total of twenty-four people, divided into two groups, and worked in the field according to the flow operation method. Two people in the front pruned and removed old leaves, combined with pulling out the "窝根草"; two people closely followed to dig nests in the cotton rows to apply fertilizer; and finally two people covered the nests, combined with loosening the soil. In this way, three processes were completed together, saving six workdays in half a day, increasing work efficiency by 25% compared to the original. On the third day, Cui Lin continued to go deep into the remote area of the Zhuwan production brigade, which was relatively backward in production, and found that this production brigade also had similar problems to those existing in the San Cang and Yuejin production brigades.

    After Cui Lin looked at the advanced, the backward, the near, and the far, he arranged the problems found in the investigation in a row, found the internal connections of these problems, and gradually clarified the problems. He felt that when the main labor force is invested in agricultural production, it is necessary to vigorously grasp ideological work, further strengthen labor management, improve the production responsibility system, better exert the enthusiasm of each commune member, and effectively strengthen the late-stage management measures to increase cotton production.

    Once the key was grasped, Cui Lin went deeper, created experience, established benchmarks, and promoted it in an all-round way.

    Through a series of measures, a vigorous late-stage cotton field management movement immediately appeared throughout the commune. According to the survey and calculation of 31 mu of cotton fields in the No. 4 production team of the Yuejin Brigade by the commune agricultural technology service station, within ten days after the classification and processing management, the three types of seedlings decreased from 20% to 8%, the boll shedding rate decreased from 30.1% in the first ten days to 26%, and the average first type of seedlings had 1.2 more autumn bolls per plant, the second type of seedlings had one more autumn boll per plant, and the third type of seedlings had two more autumn bolls per three plants.

    崔书记深入棉田
    本报记者　姜韦才
    中共江苏省东台县三仓公社委会员第一书记崔霖同志在学习了人民日报社论“大办农业，大办粮食”等有关文章后，考虑到许多问题，决定深入到田间，摸一摸当前生产急需解决的关键问题，加强秋田后期管理。
    一天早上，崔书记先到了棉花长势好、被评为“上游”的三仓大队第二生产小队。走近这个小队的棉田，只见齐人高的棉株，果枝上挂满了棉桃，棉叶一片嫩绿。这些不久前受过涝害的棉花，经过人们加工培植，长得满好。崔霖沿着田埂，边走边看，止不住内心的喜悦。他扳住一株棉花，点点数数，棉株上一般都有十来个桃子；但同时也发现棉株的顶部花蕾脱落较多。这是什么原因呢？崔霖再仔细一看，原来棉花只整了枝，没有及时松土壅根，通风透光也不够好，以致地面湿度大，棉叶上生了角斑病，影响了保蕾保铃。为什么只整枝，不及时松土、打老叶呢？崔霖边想边走。看到有一群社员在田里整枝，他就跑到田心和社员们一起劳动。崔霖问：“你们整枝后还要做些什么活？”一个社员随口回答说：“别的活嘛，没什么好做啦！”崔霖又问：“不搞松土、打老叶吗？”有几个社员争着说：“我们棉花长的好，田里又没草，松土干嘛呀？”经过一阵漫谈，崔霖发现社员有自满情绪。因此，他就在田头和社员们算了一笔账。他说：如果及时松土、打老叶，通风透光搞的好，每一株棉花至少可以多保一个花蕾，多结一个秋桃，这样一亩田就可以多收二十多斤籽棉。社员们听崔霖这一算，都高兴地说：“崔书记，你这一算，可把我们心里都算亮堂了，后期管理可一点也不能放松啊！”
    下午，崔霖又到这个大队比较后进的第四生产小队去。在一块棉田里，崔霖看到有十来个社员在治叶跳虫。他发现治虫员在喷药时像“舞龙灯”似的，只在棉叶上面喷来射去，棉叶的背面喷不到药。他仔细查看了几块已经治过虫的棉花，杀虫率只有50％左右，就和治虫员商量，采用两面喷药的办法，结果杀虫率达90％以上。
    在解决了治虫的办法后，崔霖穿过几条田埂，检查了还未治虫的棉田，发现有些棉田的虫害比较严重。但是，看看投入治虫的只有五架喷雾器，十个治虫员。他细细一算，一架喷雾器一天最快治五亩，那么这个队二百九十六亩棉田，要十多天才能治完一遍虫，岂不误了大事？崔霖很熟悉这个生产队的情况。他明明记得这个小队有九架喷雾器，十八个治虫员，为什么不全部出动呢？他又找生产小队干部和社员查问底细。小队干部说，虫已治过几遍啦，漏在田里的几个叶跳虫，也碍不了棉花增产。由于麻痹松懈，他们把四架喷雾器放在家里不用，把其余治虫员拉去搞一些不上紧的活了。
    当晚，崔霖又找了大队支部书记，召开了大队支部委员会，进一步分析了当前党员干部和群众在棉田后期管理中的思想动向和存在的问题。但是，三仓大队存在的这些问题是否有代表性呢？别的生产队还存在些什么值得注意的问题呢？他决定再到曾经受涝较重的跃进大队去看看。
    次日，崔霖又跑到跃进大队第六生产小队，和社员一起劳动。这里虽然在不久前受涝较重，但棉苗的长势也与去年不相上下。棉田里，社员们有的在整枝，有的在追肥、锄草、松土，干劲挺足。但是，他也发现了问题：各道工序之间不衔接，工效不高，有些浪费劳力。他便和社员在田头商量起来。崔霖问：“能不能把整枝、追肥、锄草松土这几项农活合着一起干？”有几个社员琢磨了一阵子说：“崔书记，行！除了治虫这一项要单做外，其他几项活儿都可以搞一条龙，连起来干能省工。”崔霖当即和社员们一起研究了一条龙的作业方法。
    一条龙的操作法到底能提高多大工效呢？崔霖决定亲自动手在这个小队试验一下。吃过午饭，他拿着工具和小队干部、社员下地了。他们一共二十四个人，分两个小组，按流水作业法，在田里干起来。两个人在前面整枝、打老叶，结合拔掉“窝根草”；两个人紧跟着在棉花行子里挖窝，施化肥；最后两个人盖窝，结合松土。这样，三道工序一起完，半天就节省了六个工，比原来提高工效25％。第三天，崔霖又继续深入到边远地区生产比较后进的朱湾生产大队，发现这个生产大队也存在着和三仓、跃进等生产大队相类似的问题。
    崔霖经过看先进，看落后，看近的，看远的，把调查发现的问题排了排队，找出了这些问题内部的联系，就逐渐明确了问题所在。他觉得，当主要劳力投入农业生产后，必须大抓思想工作，进一步加强劳动管理，健全生产责任制，更好地发挥每一个社员的积极性，切实加强棉田后期管理的增产措施。
    关键抓住了，崔霖又深入一点，创造经验，树立标兵，全面推广。
  通过一系列措施，全公社立即出现了一个轰轰烈烈的棉田后期管理运动。据公社农业技术服务站在跃进大队第四生产小队三十一亩棉田考查测算，在分类加工管理后的十天内，三类苗从20％下降到8％，落蕾率从前十天的30.1％减少到26％，平均一类苗每株多结一点二个秋桃，二类苗每株多结一个秋桃，三类苗每三株多结两个秋桃。
