Everyone should prepare for the autumn harvest like this

How should we prepare for the autumn harvest this year? The practice of the Guanyi People's Commune in Feixi, Anhui, answers this question.

The Guanyi People's Commune made comprehensive arrangements for autumn harvest preparation based on the characteristics of this year's autumn harvest. They analyzed the characteristics of this year's autumn harvest and summarized the experience of previous autumn harvests; they paid attention to the arrangement of both human resources (labor and leadership) and material resources (tools, sites, warehouses); they carried out political and ideological work and also focused on economic and organizational work. The entire set of measures was full of a revolutionary spirit striving for initiative, and also embodied a solid and meticulous work style.

What are the main characteristics of this year's autumn harvest work?

Autumn harvest crops have always accounted for the largest proportion of the year's crops in various parts of our country. This year, starting from spring plowing, the policy of both multiple crops and multiple harvests and high yields and multiple harvests was further implemented; until recently, many regions were still doing everything possible to expand the planting of "late autumn crops." From spring to autumn, everywhere is striving for more crops and higher yields. The quality of careful harvesting and meticulous threshing of various crops is also required to be higher than in the past. This makes this year's autumn harvest task more important than in previous years.

The harvest time of autumn crops is already relatively long. This year, due to more attention being paid to timely early sowing during spring planting, and more attention being paid to planting as much as possible around the beginning of autumn, some crops are harvested earlier and some crops are harvested later, and the entire autumn harvest time will inevitably be longer. Precisely because of this, it should be required to harvest faster and more timely.

There are already many kinds of autumn harvest crops. This year, various regions have further implemented the policy of taking grain as the key and comprehensively developing diversified operations, and have made more comprehensive arrangements for crops such as grain, cotton, oil, hemp, tobacco, sugar, vegetables, etc. Rice producing areas have also increased the planting of more miscellaneous grains, and industrial raw material producing areas have also paid more attention to grain self-sufficiency. Therefore, in many places, there are more kinds of autumn harvest crops.

This year, various places have managed more and larger-scale high-yield plots; at the same time, they have made fuller use of scattered plots of land. The ripening time of large high-yield plots is relatively consistent, requiring concentrated efforts for a concentrated harvest; each scattered crop should also be harvested in a timely manner, and appropriate labor and time should be arranged for it.

This year, the replanting area of autumn harvest crops has expanded, many of which are intercropped or mixed or supplementary planting. When harvesting early-maturing crops, not only should attention be paid to not damaging late-maturing crops, but also efforts should be made to strengthen field management of late-maturing crops at the same time.

The quantity of autumn harvest crops and harvesting work is large, the time is long, and the types are many, and each piece must be harvested well in a timely manner; in many places, plowing and planting must be done immediately after harvesting, some are being harvested, and some still need to be managed; some industrial raw material crops and potato crops must also be initially processed in a timely manner after harvesting; in addition, the "small autumn harvest" of collecting wild plants must also be carried out in a timely manner; coupled with the fact that many regions are in the rainy season in autumn, it increases the arduousness and complexity of autumn harvest work.

In addition to the above points, the autumn harvest of each region and each commune may have its own characteristics. Leading cadres of party committees and relevant departments at all levels should, like the comrades of the Guanyi Commune, go to various production teams and, together with the commune members, analyze the characteristics of this year's autumn harvest, absorb the experience of previous autumn harvests, and on this basis, accurately grasp the key and make a comprehensive and complete arrangement for this year's autumn harvest.

The central key to doing a good job in autumn harvest work is to rationally arrange labor and correctly use labor, and to do everything possible to improve labor efficiency. According to the characteristics of long autumn harvest time and wide front, the Guanyi Commune divides the entire autumn harvest process into several stages; each stage formulates a division-of-labor combat plan based on the specific circumstances of various agricultural tasks, such as the amount of work and the size of the tasks. Each stage does not use forces evenly and dispersedly, but uses forces flexibly and concentratedly according to the specific circumstances of each period, using the main labor force on the most important work, so that the secondary and auxiliary labor forces are also put to good use. In this way, it can not only ensure the complete victory of the first line at the time and place, but also ensure the overall victory of the second, third, and fourth lines. For example, in the stage of harvesting mid-autumn crops, all agricultural activities are divided into four lines: the first line is harvesting mid-season rice, investing 60% of the total labor force on the agricultural front, of which 70% are strong laborers; the second line is harvesting dry-land grain crops and cotton, investing 20% of the labor force, of which there are more semi-laborers; the third line is managing late-autumn crops, and the fourth line is autumn plowing, investing a total of 20% of the labor force. The leadership force is also used on different lines. On the one hand, each has its own responsibilities, and on the other hand, they closely cooperate when necessary. This segmented and line-based arrangement of work during the autumn harvest period is in line with the characteristics of autumn agricultural production, and is therefore more scientific and reasonable. In some areas, two sets of arrangements, sunny and rainy, have also been made for the autumn harvest work in various periods; combining the practice of two sets of arrangements with the practice of segmented and line-based arrangements, the work can be more proactive.

In order to greatly improve labor efficiency, a series of preparatory work must also be carried out in several aspects.

Implementing political command and promoting people's initiative and enthusiasm play a decisive role in improving labor efficiency. With sufficient labor and a reasonable labor organization, it is necessary to further arm the masses' minds with advanced ideas. It is necessary to make every commune member clearly understand that agriculture is the foundation of the national economy, understand the importance of running agriculture on a large scale, understand the importance of running grain on a large scale, especially understand the importance of doing a good job in the current autumn harvest work, and understand how closely their current work is related to the country, the collective, and each commune member, and understand how timely and meticulous the autumn harvest work is has a significant impact on output. It is necessary to mobilize commune members to discuss and formulate specific standards for achieving more, faster, better, and more economical in the harvesting of various crops, and to carry out labor competitions for increasing production and saving resources between the same types of work or between mutually connected processes, between groups and groups, teams and teams, and communes and communes. The Guanyi Commune's practices of summarizing experience, conducting comparative education, mobilizing the masses to formulate detailed harvesting covenants, and ensuring the implementation of the surplus production reward system are all very good, and can closely combine political and ideological work, organizational work, and economic work, and greatly improve people's ideological level and labor efficiency.

The reform of harvesting, transportation, and threshing tools, and the rational allocation of threshing grounds and processing sites, are directly and significantly related to improving labor efficiency. The reformed autumn harvest tools that the Guanyi Commune has prepared, if fully utilized, can increase the average work efficiency by one time compared with the old-fashioned tools, which is equivalent to increasing more than 5,000 workdays. They also equip each laborer with three small farm tools such as sickles to adapt to the characteristics of decentralized and diverse autumn harvest work, which can also greatly save time and improve labor efficiency. The preparation of these small farm tools must not be ignored; sometimes the lack of a small farm tool is equivalent to reducing a labor force.

Industry, commerce, and other departments should also fully understand the importance and complexity of this year's autumn harvest task, adapt to the different needs of various places, and promptly support the rural people's communes in autumn harvest from the aspects of materials, manpower, and technology. The support work must be practical and timely. The commercial departments in many areas of Qinghai Province have transferred a large number of cadres and divided them into two groups to go deep into the forefront of agriculture and industry to promote the production and supply of autumn harvest tools: one group goes to the rural people's communes and production teams to investigate and understand the need to add and repair autumn harvest tools, and help formulate plans for purchase, repair, and use; the other group goes to factories to investigate and understand the production of autumn harvest tools and repair parts, and help factories arrange the production of autumn harvest tools and parts according to the information learned by the other group. In this way, they truly play the role of a link between industry and agriculture, making production and supply able to connect.

Now, in some areas, early autumn crops have begun to be harvested. Most areas are busy preparing for the autumn harvest. Rural people's communes and various departments and units supporting agriculture should, like the Guanyi Commune in Feixi, Anhui, and the commercial departments in various parts of Qinghai, quickly conduct a comprehensive inspection of the preparation and support work for the autumn harvest, and quickly make up for any shortcomings in any aspect of the preparation work. The final results of the entire party and people running agriculture on a large scale and running grain on a large scale this year depend on the autumn field management and autumn harvest in the next few months. There must be full revolutionary vigor, there must be thorough preparation and practical measures; the combination of the two will provide a reliable guarantee for winning a complete victory in the autumn harvest.

    都要像这样准备秋收
    今年的秋收准备工作应当怎样做？安徽肥西馆驿人民公社的做法回答了这个问题。
    馆驿人民公社根据今年秋收的特点，全面安排了秋收准备工作。他们既分析了今年秋收的特点，又总结了往年秋收的经验；既注意了人力（劳动力和领导力量）的安排，又注意了物力（工具、场地、仓库）的安排；既进行了政治和思想工作，又抓紧了经济和组织工作。整个措施充满了力争主动的革命精神，也体现出扎实细致的工作作风。
    什么是今年秋收工作的主要特点呢？
    秋收作物历来在我国各地全年的作物中都占着最大的比重。今年，从春耕开始，就进一步贯彻执行了多种多收和高产多收同时并举的方针；直到最近，许多地区还在尽一切可能扩种“晚晚秋”。从春到秋，处处都在力争多种再多种、高产更高产。各种作物精收细打的质量，也要求比过去更加提高。这就使今年的秋收任务比往年更加重大。
    秋收作物的收获时间本来就比较长。今年由于春播期间比过去更加注意了适时早播，立秋前后又注意了尽可能多种，一部分作物收获得更早，一部分作物收获得更晚，整个秋收的时间必然拉得更长。正因如此，就应该要求收得更快更及时。
    秋收作物的种类本来就比较多。今年，各个地区进一步贯彻执行了以粮为纲、全面发展多种经营的方针，对粮、棉、油、麻、烟、糖、菜等等作物作了更全面的安排，水稻产区又增种了更多的杂粮，工业原料产区也更注意了粮食自给，因此，不少地方秋收作物的种类就更多了。
    今年，各地经营了数量更多、范围更大的丰产方；同时，对零星土地作了更充分的利用。大片丰产方成熟时间比较一致，需要集中力量突击收获；零星分散的作物每块也要及时收获，给它安排恰当的力量和时间。
    今年，秋收作物的复播面积扩大了，其中不少是套种间种或混种补种的。在收获先熟的作物的时候，不但要注意不损害后熟的作物，还要力求乘便对后熟的作物加强田间管理。
    秋收作物和收获工作数量大、时间长、种类多，每块都要及时收好；很多地方要随收随耕随种，有的正在收获，有的还须管理；一些工业原料作物和薯类在收获后还要及时进行初步加工；还有采集野生植物的“小秋收”也必须抓紧时机进行；再加上许多地区秋季正是多雨季节，就更增加了秋收工作的艰巨性和复杂性。
    各个地区、各个公社的秋收，除了以上讲的各点以外，可能还有各自的特点。各级党委和有关部门的领导干部，都应该像馆驿公社的同志们那样，到各个生产队去，同社员群众一起，分析今年秋收的特点，吸取往年秋收的经验，在这基础上，准确地抓住关键，作出今年秋收的全面的、全程的安排。
    做好秋收工作的中心关键是合理安排劳动力和正确使用劳动力，千方百计提高劳动效率。馆驿公社根据秋收时间长、战线广的特点，把秋收的全程分成几个阶段；每个阶段又根据各种农活多少、任务大小等具体情况，制定分线作战方案。每个阶段都不是平均地分散地使用力量，而是根据每个时期的具体情况灵活地集中地使用力量，把主要的劳动力使用在最主要的工作上，使次要的、辅助的劳动力也都各得其所。这样，既能确保当时当地的第一线的彻底胜利，又能保证第二、三、四线的全面胜利。例如在收获中秋作物阶段，把全部农事活动分为四线，第一线是收割中稻，投入农业战线全部劳动力的60％，其中强劳动力占70％；第二线是收获旱地粮食作物和棉花，投入20％的劳动力，其中有较多的半劳动力；第三线是管理晚秋作物，第四线是秋耕，共投入20％的劳动力。领导力量也分线使用。一方面各有专责，在必要时又密切协作。这样分段分线安排秋收期间的工作，是适应秋季农业生产的特点的，因而也是比较科学、比较合理的。在有些地区，对各个时期的秋收工作还作了晴雨两套安排；把两套安排的做法和分段分线的做法结合起来，工作就可以更加主动。
    为了大大提高劳动效率，还必须从几个方面进行一系列的准备工作。
    实行政治挂帅，发扬人的积极性主动性，在提高劳动效率中起着决定的作用。有了足够的劳动力和合理的劳力组织，还必须更进一步用先进的思想武装群众的头脑。要使每个公社社员都清楚地了解农业是国民经济的基础，了解大办农业的重要性、了解大办粮食的重要性，特别是了解把当前的秋收工作做好的重要性，了解当前自己的工作对于国家、集体和每个社员有多么密切的关系，了解秋收工作做得是否及时、是否细致对于产量有多么重大的影响。应该发动社员群众讨论，制定各种作物的收获工作达到多、快、好、省的具体标准，并在同工种之间或互相衔接的工序之间，在组与组、队与队、公社与公社之间，展开增产节约的劳动竞赛。馆驿公社通过总结经验，进行对比教育，发动群众订立细收细打公约，确保贯彻执行超产奖励制度，这些做法都是很好的，可以把政治思想工作、组织工作和经济工作密切结合起来，把人的思想水平和劳动效率大大提高。
    收割、运输、脱粒工具的改革，打谷场地、加工场所的合理配置，对于提高劳动效率有直接的重大的关系。馆驿公社已经准备好的经过改革的秋收工具，如果充分加以利用，平均工效比旧式工具可提高一倍，等于增加了五千多个劳动日。他们还给每个劳动力都配备镰刀等三件小农具，以适应秋收工作分散多样的特点，这也可以大大节省时间和提高劳动效率。对于这些小农具的准备，千万不可忽视；有的时候缺一件小农具，就等于减少了一个劳动力。
    工业、商业和其他部门，也要充分了解今年秋收任务的重大和复杂，适应各地不同的需要，及时地从物资、人力、技术等方面支援农村人民公社秋收。必须使支援的工作作到切合实际和不误时机。青海省许多地区的商业部门抽调大批干部分成两路深入农业、工业的第一线，促进秋收工具的生产和供应工作：一路到农村人民公社、生产队调查了解需要增添和修配秋收工具的情况，帮助制订购置、修配和使用的计划；一路到工厂调查了解生产秋收工具和修配零件的情况，根据另一路了解的情况帮助工厂安排秋收工具和零件的生产。这样，他们就真正起了工业和农业之间的纽带的作用，使生产和供应能够衔接起来。
    现在，一些地区，早秋作物已经开始收获了。大部分地区都在紧张地准备秋收。农村人民公社和支援农业的各部门、各单位，都应该像安徽肥西馆驿公社和青海各地商业部门这样，赶快把秋收准备和支援秋收的工作做一次全面的检查，哪一方面的准备工作还有不足之处，就赶快补起来。今年全党全民大办农业、大办粮食的最后成果，就决定于今后几个月的秋田管理和秋收。一定要有十足的革命干劲，一定要有周密的准备和切实的措施；两者结合起来，夺取秋收的全面胜利就有了可靠的保证。
