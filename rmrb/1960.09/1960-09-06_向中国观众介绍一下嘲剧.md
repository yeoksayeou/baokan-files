Introducing Chao Opera to Chinese Audiences
Chen Bang, Art Director of the Vietnamese Chao Opera Troupe

We are deeply honored to be the first Vietnamese drama troupe to visit and perform in China. We hope that this friendly visit and performance will allow Chinese friends to gain a preliminary understanding of Chao Opera, one of Vietnam's traditional dramas.

Chao Opera art has a long history. It began to take shape in the fourteenth century and entered its heyday in the fifteenth century. At that time, in addition to professional Chao Opera troupes, there were many amateur troupes composed of farmers themselves in the countryside. They usually performed in various places during production breaks and temple fairs. The content of Chao Opera repertoire is generally based on folk stories, depicting the lives of the masses. However, when mentioning emperors and officials, they are always satirized sharply, causing the audience to burst into laughter. In every classical Chao Opera repertoire, there are clowns, who demonstrate the wit and talent of the masses and use laughter to strike at all ruling forces at that time. These realistic contents of Chao Opera art are well reflected in its lively, vivid, and colorful artistic forms. As can be seen from the more than one hundred kinds of tunes that have been collected, it has extremely rich emotions and humorous content, and diverse forms; the dance postures performed with the wrist are so delicate and realistic; the Q&A between the audience and the actors is so lively; the piano and drum sounds are so powerful. All of this makes Chao Opera art have a strong national color and unique style. However, the development of Chao Opera art was interrupted for a long period. The eighty years of French imperialism's rule over Vietnam gradually buried Chao Opera art.

After the August Revolution, despite the extremely difficult and complex environment of the War of Resistance, our Party and government immediately paid attention to the excavation of national cultural heritage, especially Chao Opera art. In order to pass on the art of Chao Opera, the old artists were gathered together. From the central government to the liaison districts and provincial cultural troupes, Chao Opera art was used as the main form of serving the people. During this period, many repertoires with modern life as the theme appeared. From the rear areas where land reform was underway to the trenches on the Dien Bien Phu front, the drums of Chao Opera were heard everywhere. Although the art of Chao Opera has been greatly developed during this period, in fact, it was not until the restoration of peace in 1954 that we had the conditions to systematically study the art of Chao Opera. Now, although we still encounter many difficulties, we are working hard under the guidance of the Vietnamese Labor Party to overcome them, in order to complete the task of inheriting and developing the precious national cultural heritage.

During this visit to China, we will exchange some of our basic experiences with Chinese friends. Our Vietnamese Chao Opera Troupe was established in 1952. This performance in China is only a part of our Chao Opera Troupe, with a total of fifty-five comrades. This time we brought a total of three parts of the repertoire: The first part is excerpts from three traditional repertoires, "Ms. Mieu Thuong Temple", "Tuan Bi" and "Pretending to Be Sick". The protagonists of these three excerpts are three women who, in different environments, use their actions to resist the oppression of the old feudal ethics and defend their right to pursue freedom of love. In these three excerpts, we have strived to develop the mass character of traditional drama and vivid performance techniques. The second part is "Magic Water Bottle", a familiar folk tale of the Vietnamese people. This is the dream of the past farmers, they dream of happy love, dream of a good harvest, and also boldly dream of mastering the destiny of their motherland. This repertoire was compiled in 1957 and has become a repertoire that our troupe often performs. The third part is "The Best of Both Worlds", which reflects the appearance of farmers in our country's rural collectivization movement. Although it is still very unfamiliar to us to express modern life themes in traditional drama forms, and we lack experience, we still boldly bring it. We hope that through this repertoire, which reflects reality to a certain extent, we can help Chinese friends further understand the current situation of socialist transformation in rural Vietnam.

Now, China is in the high tide of the Great Leap Forward, and new achievements are blooming everywhere like fresh flowers in spring. You have an incomparably rich and unparalleled classical opera art. As Vietnamese artists, we are deeply pleased to be able to visit your great country. We believe that through this visit of our Chao Opera Troupe, not only will the mutual understanding between the people of our two brotherly countries be enhanced, but also good results will be obtained in the exchange of art.

    向中国观众介绍一下嘲剧
    越南嘲剧艺术团艺术指导　陈榜
    作为第一个到中国访问演出的越南戏剧团，我们深深地感到荣幸。我们希望，通过这次友谊的访问演出，将使中国朋友对越南的传统戏剧之一——嘲剧艺术获得初步的了解。
    嘲剧艺术有着悠久的历史。它开始形成于十四世纪，十五世纪就进入了兴盛时期。在当时，除了专业嘲剧团体外，在农村还有不少由农民自己组成的业余剧团，它们通常是在生产空隙和庙会期间在各地演出。嘲剧剧目的内容一般都以流传于民间的故事为主，它描绘了人民群众的生活，但当提到帝王和官吏时，总是对他们进行辛辣的讽刺，使观众发出哄然的笑声。在嘲剧的每个古典剧目里都有丑角，它表现出群众的机智才能，并用嘲笑声去打击当时的一切统治势力。嘲剧艺术这些富有现实意义的内容，在它生动活泼、丰富多采的艺术形式中得到很好的体现。从已经搜集到的一百多种曲调就可以看到，它具有极其丰富的感情和诙谐的内容，多种多样的形式；它用手腕表演的舞姿是那样细腻，逼真；在观众和演员之间的答问又是那样生动活泼；它底刚而不噪的琴鼓声又是那样富有表现力。所有这一切，使嘲剧艺术具有浓厚的民族色彩和独特的风格。但是，嘲剧艺术的发展在一个长时期内被中断了。法帝国主义对越南的八十年统治，使嘲剧艺术逐渐地被埋没了。
    八月革命后，尽管是在极其艰苦和复杂的抗战环境中，我国党和政府仍然立即注意着手于民族文化遗产，特别是嘲剧艺术的发掘工作。为了传授嘲剧艺术，把老艺人都集中起来。从中央到联区和省的文工团，也以嘲剧艺术作为服务人民的主要形式，这时期，出现了许多以现代生活为题材的剧目。从正在进行土地改革的后方到奠边府前线战壕，到处都响起了嘲剧的鼓声。虽然在这期间嘲剧艺术得到极大的发展，但实际上，直到1954年和平恢复后，我们才具备了系统地研究嘲剧艺术的条件。现在，虽然我们还遇到不少困难，但我们正在越南劳动党的指导下努力地克服它，以完成继承和发展宝贵的民族文化遗产的任务。
    在这次访问中国的过程中，我们将和中国朋友交流我们所取得的一些基本经验。我们越南嘲剧艺术团成立于1952年。这次参加访华演出的只是我们嘲剧艺术团的一部分，共有五十五位同志。这次我们带来的剧目共有三部分：第一部分是《氏妙上庙》、《循卑》和《揣方装病》三个传统剧目的片断。这三个片断的主角是三位妇女，她们在各个不同的环境中，以自己的行动来反抗旧社会封建礼教的压迫，保卫自己追求爱情自由的权利。在这三个片断中，我们努力地发展了传统戏剧的群众性和生动的表演手法。第二部分是《神水瓶》，它是越南人民熟悉的民间故事，这是过去农民的梦想，他们梦想美满的爱情，梦想着五谷丰登，并且还大胆地梦想着掌握自己祖国的命运。这个剧目于1957年整理出来后，就成为我们剧团经常演出的剧目。第三部分是《两全其美》，它反映了我国农村合作化运动中农民的面貌。虽然以传统的戏剧形式表现现代生活题材对我们来说还很陌生，并且又缺乏经验，但我们仍然大胆地把它带来，我们希望通过这个在一定程度上反映了现实生活的剧目，能帮助中国朋友进一步了解目前越南农村社会主义改造的情况。
    现在，中国正处在大跃进的高潮中，新的成就像春天的鲜花一样到处怒放。你们有着无比丰富而且举世无双的古典戏曲艺术，作为越南的艺术工作者，我们深深地为能够访问你们伟大的国家而感到愉快。我们相信，通过我们嘲剧艺术团这次访问，将不仅会增进我们两个兄弟国家人民之间的相互了解，而且，在艺术的交流方面，也必将获得良好的结果。
