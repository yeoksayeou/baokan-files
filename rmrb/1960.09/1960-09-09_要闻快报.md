News in Brief

    Anshan Iron and Steel Company Organizes "Three-Combination" Visiting Group
    Anshan Iron and Steel Company organized a "three-combination" visiting group to go deep into the front lines of steelmaking, ironmaking, mining, and rolling production to understand and help solve specific production problems.
    This visiting group included more than 170 people, including leading cadres, grassroots cadres, engineering and technical personnel, veteran workers, and advanced producers from various factories and mines. Wherever they went, they adopted the method of "observe, listen, and discuss" to understand the production situation, difficulties, and demands of the visited units. Problems that could be solved immediately were solved on the spot, and problems that could not be solved immediately were taken back for research and solution. So far, about 80% of the specific problems that the visiting group of the steelmaking system has learned about and needs to solve have been resolved.
    The Anshan Iron and Steel Company Party Committee believes that this kind of visiting group is a good form of strengthening large-scale cooperation between factories and mines. It has become a regular periodic activity in Anshan Iron and Steel.

    Zhuoxian Iron Mine Makes Rapid Progress
    Zhuoxian Iron Mine in Hebei Province launched the masses to carry out technical transformation in a big way, which promoted the continuous leap forward in production. In the past six months, the mine has completed more than 20 major innovation projects, improved and created more than 100 sets (pieces) of new machines and tools, and laid more than 2,000 meters of tunnels and mine transport tracks, which has enabled the mine's main roadways to achieve parallel rail transport, winch-hoisting of heavy vehicles uphill, and sliding downhill, thereby greatly accelerating the mine's development from "small indigenous groups" to "small foreign groups." In the first eight months of this year, it has completed more than 90% of the annual plan.

    Tangshan Implements Contract Transportation for Factories
    The Tangshan Transportation Bureau Transportation Team moved to the steel plant to implement contract transportation for factories, workshops, and furnaces, saving time and transportation capacity for dispatching vehicles, and effectively improving transportation efficiency. Recently, the Transportation Bureau has also adopted management methods such as cadres working on-site, dispatching work on-site, propaganda and mobilization on-site, livestock breeding on-site, and vehicle maintenance on-site, which has more powerfully supported steel production.

    Chaoyang Wharf Has High Loading Efficiency
    Workers at Chaoyang Wharf in Beibei District, Chongqing City, made great efforts to load trains in rows with funnels according to local conditions, and realized that the loading efficiency of each train was accurate to the ton, increasing the loading efficiency from 20 trains per day to 480 trains per day. Then, they changed the single-row funnel single-row loading to double-row funnel double-row loading, and the loading efficiency doubled again, greatly speeding up the turnover of trains and ships, and increasing the monthly transport volume of coal and coke from more than 900 tons to more than 9,000 tons, ensuring the timely transportation of coal and coke and meeting the needs of steel production.

    Wangcang Coal Mine Achieves High Yields Every Month
    The Wangcang Coal Mine Party Committee in Sichuan Province adopted the method of "guaranteeing, upgrading, and attacking" to ensure high monthly coal production. Guaranteeing means consolidating the existing high-yield level, only increasing and not decreasing, and creating favorable conditions to prepare for production to leap to a higher level. Upgrading means taking the existing high-yield level as a starting point, estimating the extent to which production can increase in the next step based on the possibility of objective conditions, timely proposing new goals and new battle slogans to the masses, and formulating new measures. Attacking means identifying key points, attacking key points, and seizing high yields. This cycle continues, promoting production to leap forward again and again. Since April, coal production has increased by 30% every month, and the annual plan was overfulfilled four months ahead of schedule.

    要闻快报
    鞍钢组织“三结合”访问团
    鞍山钢铁公司组织“三结合”访问团，深入到炼钢、炼铁、矿山、轧钢生产第一线，了解和帮助解决生产上的具体问题。
    这个访问团包括各厂矿的领导干部、基层干部、工程技术人员、老工人和先进生产者等一百七十多人。他们每到一个地方，都是采取一看、二听、三座谈的办法，了解被访问单位的生产情况、困难和要求。凡是能立即解决的问题，就当场解决，凡是一时解决不了的问题，就带回去进行研究后解决。炼钢系统的访问小组了解到的要解决的具体问题，到目前为止，已经解决了百分之八十左右。
    鞍钢党委认为这种访问团，是加强各厂矿之间大协作的一个好形式。它在鞍钢已经成为经常性的定期活动。
    涿县铁矿快步迈进
    河北省涿县铁矿发动群众大搞技术改造，促进了生产的持续跃进。半年多来，全矿共实现较大革新项目二十多项，改进、创造新机具一百多台（件），铺设坑道、矿场运输轨道两千多米，使这个矿的主要巷道实现了平行运输轨道化，重车上行卷扬化、下行滑行化，从而大大加快了这个矿由“小土群”向“小洋群”发展的速度，今年前八个月，已完成年度计划百分之九十以上。
    唐山实行包厂运输
    唐山市交通运输局运输队，搬到钢铁厂实行包厂、包车间、包炉运输，节省了出车收车的时间和运力，有效地提高了运输效率。最近这个运输局又采取干部办公到现场，调度工作到现场，宣传鼓动到现场，牲畜饲养到现场、车辆维修到现场的管理办法，更有力地支援了钢铁生产。
    朝阳码头装车效率高
    重庆市北碚区朝阳码头职工，因地制宜地大搞漏斗成列装车，实现了成列装车吨不过分，装车效率由每天装二十车，提高到每天装四百八十车。接着他们又把单排漏斗单列装车改成双排漏斗双列装车，装车效率又提高一倍，大大加快了车船周转，使煤焦的月运量由九百多吨提高到九千吨以上，保证了煤焦及时运输，供应钢铁生产的需要。
    旺苍煤矿月月高产
    四川旺苍煤矿党委采取“保、升、攻”的方法保证煤炭月月高产。保，就是巩固已有的高产水平只上升，不下降，并创造有利条件，为生产再跃进到一个更高的水平做好准备。升，就是以现有高产水平做起点，根据客观条件的可能，估计出下一步生产上升的幅度，及时给群众提出新的奋斗目标、新的战斗口号，并制订新的措施。攻，就是排关键、攻关键、夺高产。这样循环不已，促进生产一跃再跃。从四月份以来，煤炭生产每月递增百分之三十，提前四个月超额完成了全年计划。
