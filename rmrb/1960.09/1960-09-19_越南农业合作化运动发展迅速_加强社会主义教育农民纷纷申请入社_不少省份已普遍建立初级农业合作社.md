　　Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, September 17th - Vietnam's Northern agricultural cooperativization movement is developing rapidly, and many provinces have basically realized agricultural cooperativization (the establishment of elementary agricultural cooperatives).

　　According to a report in the Vietnamese "People's Daily" on September 17th, as of September 14th, in the nineteen provinces of North Vietnam alone (including three mountainous provinces), 280,000 new farm households have joined agricultural cooperatives. In Ninh Binh, Bac Giang, Son Tay, Hai Duong, Hung Yen and other provinces, the number of farm households participating in agricultural cooperatives accounts for 78% to 84% of the total number of farm households, basically completing elementary agricultural cooperativization. Currently, these provinces are continuing to advance the cooperativization movement and are paying attention to the consolidation of cooperatives.

　　The rapid development of cooperative building in North Vietnam this autumn is inseparable from strengthening socialist education for farmers. After North Vietnam held a cooperativization conference in early August, all localities launched socialist education for farmers. After studying, the farmers saw their future more clearly and saw the superiority of cooperativization, and thus eagerly requested to join agricultural cooperatives.

　　At present, socialist education in the middle reaches of the Red River and the plains of North Vietnam has basically ended, and the cooperativization movement is unfolding more widely.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi - According to newspapers here: after conducting socialist education in the countryside, most provinces and regions in North Vietnam have seen a great improvement in farmers' awareness, and the agricultural cooperativization movement has developed rapidly.

　　After studying, farmers in Hai Duong Province enthusiastically applied to join cooperatives. According to preliminary statistics, 25,000 farm households in the province have applied to join cooperatives, reaching 80% of the province's autumn cooperative construction plan target. In many townships, the number of farm households joining cooperatives has increased from the original 39% of the total number of farm households to 88.7%.

　　In the ten days after conducting education on the issue of cooperativization in Nam Dinh Province, 14,500 farm households applied to join cooperatives, doubling the number of farm households that joined during the spring and summer this year.

　　More than 10,000 farm households in Ha Dong Province have recently applied to join cooperatives. It is expected that all counties in the province will have 80% of the farm households joining cooperatives this year.

　　After studying, another 4,556 farm households in Hung Yen Province have joined cooperatives. In many townships, the number of farm households joining cooperatives has reached 96% to 97% of the total number of farm households. In the Vinh Linh area, which has basically completed agricultural cooperativization, it is expected that 50% of the farm households will be transformed from elementary cooperatives to advanced cooperatives this year.

    越南农业合作化运动发展迅速
    加强社会主义教育农民纷纷申请入社
    不少省份已普遍建立初级农业合作社
    新华社河内17日电　越南北方农业合作化运动发展迅速，不少省份已经基本上实现了农业合作化（建立初级农业合作社）。
    据越南“人民报”17日报道，截至9月14日为止，仅越南北方十九个省（包括山区三个省），新加入农业合作社的就有二十八万个农户。宁平、北江、山西、海阳、兴安等省参加农业社的农户已经占农户总数的78％到84％，基本上完成了初级农业合作化。现在，这些省份正在继续推进合作化运动，并注意合作社的巩固工作。
    越南北方秋季建社的迅速发展，是同加强对农民的社会主义教育分不开的。在8月初越南北方召开了合作化会议以后，各地都展开了对农民的社会主义教育。经过学习以后，农民们更清楚地看到了自己的前途，看到了合作化的优越性，从而纷纷要求加入农业合作社。
    目前，越南北方红河中游和平原地区的社会主义教育工作已经基本结束，合作化运动正在更加广泛地展开。
    据新华社河内讯　据这里的报纸报道：越南北方大部分省区，在农村中进行了社会主义教育以后，农民觉悟有很大提高，农业合作化运动得到迅速发展。
    海阳省农民在学习之后，都踊跃申请加入合作社。据初步统计，全省已有二万五千农户申请入社，达到全省秋季建社计划指标的80％。许多乡入社农户从原来占农户总数的39％发展到88.7％。
    南定省在进行合作化问题的教育之后的十天内，申请入社的农户就有一万四千五百户，比今年春夏期间入社的农户增加了一倍。
    河东省最近申请入社农户在一万户以上。预料全省各县在今年内都将达到80％的农户加入合作社。
    兴安省农民经过学习之后，又有四千五百五十六户加入了合作社。许多乡入社农户已经达到农户总数的96％到97％。已经基本完成农业合作化的永灵区，在今年内预计将有50％的农户从初级社转为高级社。
