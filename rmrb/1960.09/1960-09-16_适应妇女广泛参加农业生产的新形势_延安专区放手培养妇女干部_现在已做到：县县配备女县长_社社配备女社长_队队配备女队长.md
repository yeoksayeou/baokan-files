To Adapt to the New Situation of Women's Extensive Participation in Agricultural Production
Yan'an Prefecture Boldly Cultivates Women Cadres
Now Achieved: Every County Equipped with Female County Head, Every Commune Equipped with Female Commune Head, Every Team Equipped with Female Team Leader

(Our Dispatch) In light of the new situation where women have become a powerful new force on the agricultural front, Yan'an Prefecture, Shaanxi Province, is boldly cultivating and promoting women cadres, achieving the goal of equipping every county with a female county head, every commune with a female commune head, and every team with a female team leader. This mobilizes the enthusiasm of the broad masses of women from all aspects and further strengthens the leadership on the front lines of production.

In recent years, especially after the establishment of communes, the broad masses of women have been liberated from tedious housework and have embarked on the agricultural front. Before collectivization, less than 30% of the 150,000 female laborers in the entire prefecture participated in agricultural production during the busy season. By 1958, this had reached over 80%, and currently, almost all women with labor power are participating in production labor. In some places, women have become the main force in field production. According to a recent survey of the Yangjiagou Production Team of the Yanhewan Commune in Yan'an County, female labor in field production accounts for 68.9% of the total male and female labor force. In Longfang Commune, Huangling County, women accounted for 45.2% of the total labor days performed by all commune members last year. Therefore, the masses say, "Women's power is boundless, holding up half the sky in production." After the broad masses of women joined the production front, they demanded further strengthening the leadership of women in labor production, better solving the specific problems of women's household burdens, social education, and labor protection, so that women can play a greater role in production. Therefore, cultivating and promoting women cadres has become a very important issue. Yan'an Prefecture is an old revolutionary base. In the long-term revolutionary struggle and the production and construction of the past few years, the broad masses of women cadres and women have been tempered in all aspects, and a large number of women backbones and advanced figures with firm political stances and close ties to the masses have emerged.

The Yan'an Prefectural Committee of the Communist Party of China analyzed the above situation and believed that taking immediate measures to cultivate and promote a large number of female leading cadres is one of the important conditions for strengthening the agricultural front and doing all work well. Therefore, at the end of May this year, it made a decision to immediately equip and strengthen female leading cadres in leadership at all levels. As of now, all seven counties in the prefecture have been equipped with female county heads, most of the eighty-eight communes have been equipped with female commune heads, and all two thousand and sixty-three production teams and seven thousand four hundred and seventeen production sub-teams have also been equipped with female team leaders. In the cultivation and allocation of women cadres, ideological education was earnestly carried out, and the new situation of agricultural production development was greatly discussed, as was the great role of women in various leadership positions and in the cause of socialist construction. This not only criticized and overcame the thinking of some male cadres who believed that women were a burden, lacked ability, and looked down on women, but also boosted the confidence and drive of women cadres to do their work well and established lofty ambitions. In order to equip women cadres, party organizations at all levels have strengthened training work, achieving the goal of promoting and training at the same time. Their method is to first arrange for the women backbones and activists who have emerged in recent years with both ability and integrity, place them in leadership positions, and then train them in actual work to continuously improve their leadership skills. The Prefectural Committee recently made a special decision requiring all county party schools to set up women cadre training classes and complete the training of all female cadres above the level of production team leader within this year. At present, more than 240 women cadres in the entire prefecture have received their first training. Party committees at all levels have also listed the cultivation and improvement of women cadres as one of their important tasks. Huangling County has also adopted the method of "old leading the new," that is, the county head leading the commune head, and the commune head leading the team leader, to specifically help with work, and to establish models for mutual learning and mutual assistance to cultivate women cadres.

After women leading cadres were equipped and strengthened, they brought into play the organizational and leadership abilities of women cadres, and the special problems of women were well taken care of, further mobilizing the enthusiasm of the broad masses of women to participate in agricultural production.

    适应妇女广泛参加农业生产的新形势
    延安专区放手培养妇女干部
    现在已做到：县县配备女县长　社社配备女社长　队队配备女队长
    本报讯　陕西省延安专区针对妇女群众成为农业战线上一支强大生力军的新形势，放手培养和提拔妇女干部，做到县县配备女县长，社社配备女社长，队队配备女队长，从各方面调动妇女群众的积极性，进一步加强了生产第一线的领导。
    几年来，特别是公社化以后，广大妇女群众从繁琐的家务劳动中解放出来，走上了农业战线。全专区十五万妇女劳力，合作化以前在农忙时间参加农业生产的还不到30％，到1958年已达到80％以上，目前凡有劳动力的妇女几乎全部参加生产劳动。有些地方，妇女已经成为田间生产的主要力量。据最近在延安县延河湾公社杨家沟生产队的调查，田间生产的妇女劳力占到男女总劳力的68.9％。黄陵县隆坊公社去年全社社员共做的总劳动日中，妇女做的劳动日占了45.2％。因此，群众说“妇女力量大无边，顶住生产半边天”。广大妇女走上生产战线以后，要求进一步加强对妇女在劳动生产中的领导，更好地解决妇女们的家务拖累、社会教育、劳动保护等具体问题，使妇女在生产中发挥更大的作用。因此，培养和提拔妇女干部，就成为很重要的问题。延安专区是老根据地，在长期的革命斗争和几年来的生产建设中，广大妇女干部和妇女群众，各方面都受到了锻炼，涌现出成批政治坚定、密切联系群众的妇女骨干和先进人物。
    中共延安地委分析了以上情况，认为立即采取措施，大量培养提拔妇女领导干部，是加强农业战线和做好一切工作的重要条件之一。因此，在今年5月底便作出决定，立即在各级领导中配备和加强妇女领导骨干。截至目前，全专区七个县已经全部配备了女县长，八十八个公社大部配备了女社长，二千零六十三个生产队和七千四百一十七个生产小队也全部配备了女队长。在培养和配备妇女干部中，认真地进行了思想教育工作，大讲当前农业生产发展的新形势，大讲妇女在各种领导岗位上和社会主义建设事业中的巨大作用，不仅批判和克服了一些男干部认为妇女拖累大、能力差、看不起妇女的思想，而且鼓舞了妇女干部做好工作的信心和干劲，树立起雄心壮志。为了配备妇女干部，各级党组织都加强培养训练工作，做到了边提拔、边培养。他们的办法是首先安排好近几年涌现出来的德才兼备的妇女骨干和积极分子，把她们放在领导岗位上，然后在实际工作中培养，不断提高她们的领导才能。地委最近又专门作出决定，要求各县党校都设立妇女干部训练班，在今年内把生产队长以上的女干部，全部训练完毕。现在，全专区受过第一次训练的妇女干部，已有二百四十多人。各级党委也都把培养提高妇女干部列为重要任务之一。黄陵县还采取以老带新，即县长带社长，社长带队长，具体帮助进行工作，并树立标兵进行互相学习，互相帮助的办法，培养妇女干部。
    妇女领导干部配备和加强起来以后，发挥了妇女干部组织能力和领导能力，使妇女的特殊问题得到了很好的照顾，进一步调动了妇女群众参加农业生产的积极性。
