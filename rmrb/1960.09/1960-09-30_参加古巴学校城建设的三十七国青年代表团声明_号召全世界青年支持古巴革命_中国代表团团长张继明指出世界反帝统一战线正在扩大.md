Xinhua News Agency, Havana, September 28th: Youth delegations from thirty-seven Latin American, Asian, African, and European countries participating in the construction of the Camilo Cienfuegos School City issued a statement at a press conference here today, expressing full support for the Cuban Revolution and the Havana Declaration. The youth delegations from these countries returned to Havana five days ago from the Sierra Maestra mountains.

The statement called on youth around the world to support the Cuban Revolution. The statement said, "The Cuban revolution is our own revolution, Cuba's anti-imperialist struggle is our own struggle, and Cuba's achievements are our own achievements."

The statement emphasized that the Havana Declaration is a program of struggle for the Cuban people, expressing the aspirations of the people of Latin America and the underdeveloped countries of the world. Therefore, we warmly support this declaration.

The statement condemned U.S. imperialism's attempts to change the path chosen by the Cuban people, and its conspiracy to strangle the Cuban Revolution and re-establish a semi-colonial regime in Cuba. The statement pointed out that the United States has exerted economic pressure on Cuba and is preparing for armed aggression against Cuba.

The statement said that these conspiracies by the United States would be futile. Cuba has a people and government determined to fight to the end, and Cuba is not isolated. The statement concluded by saying that the youth of Latin America, Asia, Africa, and Europe will more actively support the heroic Cuban people.

Zhang Jiming, head of the Chinese Youth Delegation, spoke at the press conference. He said that we see the Cuban people are engaged in a tit-for-tat struggle against U.S. imperialism.

Zhang Jiming said that the brilliant banner of the Havana Declaration has been raised high. The Chinese people and Chinese youth resolutely oppose the "Declaration of San José" because it is a counter-revolutionary declaration; the Chinese people and Chinese youth fully support the Havana Declaration because it is a revolutionary declaration, which reflects the aspirations of the Cuban people.

Zhang Jiming said: U.S. imperialism and its running dogs are increasingly isolated in the world. The people of all countries in the world are uniting more and more closely. We are convinced that the youth will continue to support the Cuban Revolution not only here, but also after they return to their home countries.

Zhang Jiming pointed out that the anti-imperialist united front of the people of all countries in the world is expanding day by day. He said that as the people of all countries organize a broader anti-imperialist united front, the revolutionary cause of the people will achieve greater victories. Revolutionary storms in Asia, Africa, and Latin America will set off a new high tide. Imperialism is approaching its demise. Only by defeating imperialism can we win lasting peace. Zhang Jiming concluded by saying that we wish the Cuban Revolution victorious development.

Youth representatives from Argentina, Honduras, Martinique, Panama, the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, Czechoslovakia, Lebanon, the United States, and other countries also spoke at the press conference.

　  号召全世界青年支持古巴革命

    新华社哈瓦那28日电　参加卡米洛·西恩富戈斯学校城建设工作的拉丁美洲、亚洲、非洲和欧洲三十七个国家的青年代表团今天在这里举行的记者招待会上发表一项声明，表示完全支持古巴革命和哈瓦那宣言。这些国家的青年代表团是在五天前从马埃斯特腊山区回到哈瓦那的。
    声明号召全世界的青年支持古巴革命。声明说，“古巴的革命也就是我们自己的革命，古巴的反帝斗争也就是我们自己的斗争，古巴的成就也就是我们自己的成就。”
    声明强调指出，哈瓦那宣言是古巴人民的斗争纲领，它表达了拉丁美洲和全世界不发达国家人民的愿望，因此，我们热烈支持这个宣言。
    声明谴责美帝国主义企图改变古巴人民所选择的道路，并且阴谋扼杀古巴革命和在古巴重新建立半殖民地的政权。声明指出，美国对古巴施加了经济压力，并且正在准备对古巴进行武装侵略。
    声明说，美国的这种阴谋将是徒劳的。古巴有着决心战斗到底的人民和政府，并且古巴并不是孤立的。声明最后表示，拉丁美洲、亚洲、非洲和欧洲的青年将更积极地支持英勇的古巴人民。
    中国青年代表团团长张继明在记者招待会上讲了话。他说，我们看到古巴人民正与美帝国主义进行着针锋相对的斗争。
    张继明说，哈瓦那宣言的光辉旗帜已经高高举起。中国人民和中国青年坚决反对“圣约瑟宣言”，因为这是一个反革命的宣言；中国人民和中国青年全力支持哈瓦那宣言，因为这是一个革命的宣言，这项宣言反映了古巴人民的愿望。
    张继明说：美帝国主义和它的走狗们在世界上正日益陷于孤立。全世界各国人民正在日益紧密地团结起来。我们确信，青年们不仅在这里，而且在他们回国之后，将继续支持古巴革命。
    张继明指出，全世界各国人民的反帝统一战线正在日益扩大。他说，随着各国人民组织起一条更加广泛的反帝统一战线，人民的革命事业就将取得更大的胜利。亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲的革命风暴将掀起新的高潮。帝国主义日益接近灭亡。只有打败帝国主义，我们才能赢得持久和平。张继明最后说，我们祝古巴革命胜利发展。
    阿根廷、洪都拉斯、马提尼克、巴拿马、越南民主共和国、朝鲜民主主义人民共和国、捷克斯洛伐克、黎巴嫩、美国等国的青年代表也在记者招待会上讲了话。
