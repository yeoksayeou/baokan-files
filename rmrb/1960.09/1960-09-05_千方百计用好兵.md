Use Dispatching Skillfully

    The Dongzhuosu People's Commune in Shulu County, Hebei Province, grasps the laws of production, adapts to local conditions and seasons, and rationally arranges labor. Based on its experience in leading production over the years, the commune party committee makes comprehensive plans in advance, considering the size of agricultural tasks in different periods and the amount of labor required, adhering to the principle of overall planning and comprehensive consideration. It focuses on current production on the one hand and preparation for the next stage of production on the other. For relatively concentrated agricultural tasks, it adopts the method of concentrating the main labor force to fight annihilation battles, attacking key production points, so that various production activities are closely linked. For example, before the summer harvest, in order to prevent the concentration of agricultural work and the impact on cotton field management, the whole commune concentrated its labor force to carry out intensive cultivation, pest control, top dressing, and watering of cotton. By the time of the summer harvest, it not only met the labor needs of the summer harvest but also ensured the normal growth of cotton. During the drought period, in addition to rushing to fight drought, watering and protecting seedlings, it also focused on cultivating and weeding, ensuring that every watering was followed by weeding, and eliminating weeds in their early stages. Therefore, after the rainy season, there was no large-scale weed infestation in the whole commune. Due to the skillful labor dispatch, various agricultural activities were carried out quickly and well. This year, the 43,000 mu of cotton in the whole commune have been hoed twice more than last year. The cultivation of more than 40,000 mu of grain crops has also been greatly advanced compared to the same period last year.

Establish a Farm Work Bulletin

    The Fifth Production Team of the Second Brigade of the Zhuaying People's Commune in Lankao County, Henan Province, implemented a production management method of publicly posting farm work, established a production order with cadres dividing responsibilities and work groups taking collective responsibility, and fully mobilized the initiative and enthusiasm of commune members.
    This production team makes a small short-term plan every five days, first lining up the farm work, and then setting out the task requirements and contracting persons in charge for each farm work, and publishing them, so that the commune members know what work to do in five days, so as to produce according to the principle of prioritizing urgent matters and then attending to odd jobs after the whole job is completed.
    Practice has proved that the "Farm Work Bulletin" is a good method of production management. First, it strengthens the planning of production; second, it uses labor more rationally and fully mobilizes the enthusiasm and initiative of commune members; third, the production team leader is freed from the trivial matters of assigning work, and has more time to participate in labor; fourth, it implements the collective leadership and division of labor responsibility system of the team committee, and fully plays the role of the team committee and work group leaders.

Farm Work Divided into Three Grades

    The Third Production Team of the Yangchang Brigade of the Yuntai Commune in Guanyun County, Jiangsu Province, in the current situation where harvesting, planting and management are carried out simultaneously, divides farm work into three grades (urgent, priority, and deferred), skillfully arranging time and rationally using labor.
    In late August, when 173 mu of early corn matured, the pest control work in the 307 mu of soybean fields was not yet finished, and the six mu of vegetable land newly planted in the canteen also urgently needed watering and pest control; in addition, 74 mu of sweet potatoes had just been weeded, and the next stage required turning the vines and top dressing. Team leader Qiao Naichang led the team committee members to conduct careful research and lined up the manpower, material resources, and time required for each farm work, item by item. It was decided to take the harvesting of early corn as the central task, concentrating efforts on rushing to harvest during the day, and using the two hours before breakfast to carry out pest control in the bean fields with all the labor force, and in the evening, mobilizing some forces to scoop water to water the vegetables. It was effectively ensured that urgent matters were handled urgently (pest control), the central work was prominent (autumn harvest), and tasks that could be delayed (late sweet potato vine turning work) were postponed for a few days. From August 23rd to 26th, the corn has been basically harvested, the pests in the soybean fields have been eliminated, and the pest development in the canteen vegetable fields has been stopped. The masses are very satisfied with this method of arranging farm work, and generally say: "Farm work is divided into three grades, and the team leader uses soldiers with discretion."

Arrange Labor with "Three Main Emphases"

    The Heyin Commune in Guide County, Qinghai, arranges labor based on the spirit of "three main emphases." The so-called "three main emphases" are: taking agriculture as the main focus, while taking into account industry, commerce, culture, education, and health; taking grain production as the main focus, while taking into account forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and other diversified operations; taking current production as the main focus, while taking into account basic construction. According to this principle, the Heyin Commune transferred 974 laborers from commune-run industries, livelihood and welfare undertakings, sideline occupations, and other departments to strengthen field production. At present, the labor force invested in field production in this commune accounts for 80.4 percent of the total labor force. (Attached picture)

    千方百计用好兵
    调度有方
    河北束鹿县东卓宿人民公社抓生产规律，因地因时制宜，合理安排劳动力。公社党委根据历年来领导生产的经验，对不同时期的农活任务大小，和占用劳力多少，本着统筹兼顾，全面安排的原则，提前作出全面规划。一手抓当前生产，一手抓下段生产准备。对比较集中的农活，采取集中主要劳力打歼灭战的办法，攻打生产关键，使各项生产一环紧扣一环。如在夏收前，为了防止到时农活集中和影响棉田管理造成损失，全社就集中劳力突击棉花的中耕、除虫、追肥、浇水。到夏收时，既满足了夏收需要的劳力，又保证了棉花的正常生长。在天旱时期，除了突击抗旱浇水保苗外，还狠抓中耕除草，作到浇一水锄一遍，把杂草消灭在初生期。因而进入雨季以后，全社没有出现大片草荒。由于劳力调度有方，使各项农活进行得既快又好。今年全社四万三千亩棉花，普遍比去年多锄了两遍。四万多亩粮食作物中耕，也比去年同期大大提前了。
    建立农活榜
    河南兰考县爪营公社第二大队第五生产队实行了农活张榜公布的生产管理方法，建立了干部分工负责和作业组集体负责的生产秩序，充分发挥了社员的主动性、积极性。
    这个生产队五天订一次小段计划，先把农活站站队，然后订出各项农活的任务要求和包工负责人张榜公布出去，让社员都知道五天内干什么活，以便根据先急后缓、先整后零的原则去生产。
    实践证明：“农活榜”是生产管理的一种好方法。一、加强了生产的计划性；二、更合理地使用劳力，充分发挥社员的积极性和主动性；三、生产队长摆脱了派工和事务琐事，有更多的时间参加劳动；四、实行队委集体领导和分工负责制度，充分发挥了队委和作业组长的作用。
    农活分三等
    江苏省灌云县云台公社杨场大队第三生产小队在当前收、种、管各项农活交错进行的情况下，将农活分成三等（急办的、先办的、缓办的），巧妙地安排时间，合理地使用劳力。
    这个小队在8月下旬，一百七十三亩早玉米成熟的时候，三百零七亩大豆田里的治虫工作还未结束，食堂里新种的六亩菜地也急需浇水治虫；另外，七十四亩甘薯刚刚锄过草，下阶段需要翻藤追肥。队长乔乃昌领导队委委员作了周密研究，把作好各项农活所需的人力、物力、时间等，一项一项地加以排队。决定把早玉米的收割当为中心工作，白天集中力量抢收，利用早饭以前两小时的时间，全部劳力突击进行豆地治虫工作，晚上又机动地抽出一部分力量戽水浇菜。切实地做到了急的急办（治虫）、中心工作突出（秋收），可以缓办的（晚甘薯翻藤工作）就推迟了几天。从8月23日到26日，玉米已基本收割结束，大豆田的虫害已经清除，食堂菜地的虫害已经停止发展。群众对这种安排农活的办法很满意，普遍说：“农活分三等，队长用兵有分寸”。
    安排劳力“三为主”
    青海贵德县河阴公社本着“三为主”的精神安排劳力。所谓“三为主”，就是以农业为主兼顾工、商、文教、卫生等事业；以粮食生产为主兼顾林、牧、副业等多种经营；以当前生产为主兼顾基本建设。根据这个原则，河阴公社从社办工业、生活福利事业、副业等部门抽调了九百七十四个劳力，加强田间生产。目前，这个公社投入田间生产的劳力占总劳力的百分之八十点四。（附图片）
