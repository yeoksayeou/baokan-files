Xinhua News Agency, Ulaanbaatar, 20th -- The Chinese government delegation and the Mongolian government delegation signed the "Agreement on the Dispatch of Chinese Workers to Assist the People's Republic of Mongolia in Production and Construction" in Ulaanbaatar this afternoon.

Signing the agreement were Xie Fusheng, head of the Chinese government delegation and Chinese Ambassador to Mongolia, and Balzhid, head of the Mongolian government delegation and Chairman of the Mongolian Committee for Foreign Economic Relations.

Also present at the signing ceremony were Molomjamts, First Deputy Chairman of the Mongolian Council of Ministers, Vice Chairman Maidar, Ragchaa, Chairman of the State Planning Commission, Shagdar Suran, Minister of Foreign Affairs, and all members of the Chinese government delegation and the Mongolian government delegation.

Subsequently, the Mongolian government delegation held a banquet to entertain the Chinese government delegation. Balzhid, Ragchaa, Shagdar Suran, and the delegation of the Sino-Mongolian Friendship Association headed by Cao Diqiu, Vice President of the Sino-Mongolian Friendship Association, as well as representatives of Chinese employees in Mongolia, attended the reception. Balzhid and Xie Fusheng spoke at the meeting successively.

Balzhid said that the Chinese people, like the Soviet people, have given the Mongolian people fraternal and generous assistance. This assistance has further consolidated the friendship between the Mongolian and Chinese peoples and the strength of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union. Since 1955, China has sent engineering and technical personnel and workers who, with their selfless labor day and night on the Mongolian production front, have made great contributions to Mongolia's socialist construction.

Ambassador Xie Fusheng said in his speech that the signing of this new agreement marks a further strengthening and development of the friendship between the Chinese and Mongolian peoples. He said that mutual support and assistance between socialist brother countries is of great significance for consolidating and strengthening the strength of the socialist camp, defeating imperialism, and striving for lasting world peace. He said that Chinese and Mongolian workers have established a deep friendship in their joint labor; this close friendship will surely be further promoted and carried forward.

Molomjamts, First Deputy Chairman of the Mongolian Council of Ministers, also spoke at the meeting. He said that Chinese workers in Mongolia have helped Mongolian workers improve their skills and accelerated Mongolia's construction with their selfless labor. He pointed out that Premier Zhou Enlai's friendly visit to Mongolia this year and the treaties and agreements signed between Mongolia and China have greatly contributed to enhancing the friendship between the two peoples. He said that the Mongolian-Chinese Friendship Decade starting tomorrow (September 21) will help strengthen the friendship and unity between the two countries.

Cao Diqiu, Vice President of the Sino-Mongolian Friendship Association, raised his glass at the meeting to wish for the further consolidation of the friendship between the Chinese and Mongolian peoples, the further development of economic and cultural cooperation between the two countries, and greater achievements in Mongolia's socialist construction. The reception was filled with a warm and friendly atmosphere.
