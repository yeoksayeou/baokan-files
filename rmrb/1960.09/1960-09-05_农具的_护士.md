    The Agricultural Implement "Nurse"
    "Agricultural implements are like weapons for soldiers; if they are not properly maintained, agricultural production will be affected." This is a saying often uttered by Zhang Tuqing, the agricultural implement keeper of the Poke Team.
    Zhang Tuqing has been a keeper for four years. None of the agricultural implements he keeps have been lost or rotted. In the past year, he has saved more than 800 yuan in agricultural implement repair costs. Zhang Tuqing's method of keeping agricultural implements is to place those that are susceptible to moisture upstairs, and to pad the ground floor with wooden boards and rice straw. At the same time, he regularly organizes them according to the agricultural season, placing the ones to be used together in sets. Iron agricultural implements are prone to rust, so he dries each part and applies oil. Bamboo and wicker utensils are most susceptible to mildew or insect infestation, so he regularly takes them out to air. Baskets that have been used to carry soil and fertilizer powder are immediately scrubbed clean. Zhang Tuqing can also repair agricultural implements himself when they are damaged. Once, during the busy autumn plowing and sowing season, a plow broke, and the carpenter was not available. Zhang Tuqing repaired the plow himself. The commune members said: Zhang Tuqing is not only the "nurse" of agricultural implements, but also the "doctor" of agricultural implements.

    农具的“护士”
    “农具好比战士的武器，保管不好就要影响农业生产。”这是破坑小队农具保管员章土庆常说的一句话。
    章土庆担任保管员已有四年了，他保管的农具没有丢失和霉烂，一年来，共节省农具修理费八百多元。章土庆保管农具的方法是把怕受潮的农具放在楼上，楼下地面垫上木板和稻草，同时根据农时季节经常整理，把要用的配成套放在一起：铁制农具容易生锈，他就把每个零件擦干涂油。篾竹器最易霉烂或受虫蛀，他经常拿出来翻晒。挑过土和盛过肥田粉的箩筐，马上刷洗干净。农具坏了，章土庆还能自己动手修理。有一次，正是秋耕秋种紧张时期，一张犁坏了，木工又不在，章土庆就自己动手把犁修理好了。社员们说：章土庆不但是农具的“护士”，还是农具的“医生”。
