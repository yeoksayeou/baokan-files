Xinhua News Agency, September 13th, Washington dispatch: The US State Department issued a statement on September 8th regarding the hundredth meeting of the Sino-US ambassadorial talks, which once again fell into a stalemate on the issue of exchanging journalists. This statement completely distorted the facts, reversed black and white, and attempted to deceive world public opinion, shifting the responsibility for the United States' deliberate obstruction of the exchange of journalists between the two countries based on the principle of equality and mutual benefit onto China.

In this statement, the US State Department cited the proposals made by US Ambassador Beam in the Sino-US talks, hypocritically saying that the United States has been "making efforts" to realize the exchange of journalists between China and the United States, and is "ready to exchange journalists with Communist China at any time based on the principle of equality and mutual benefit." However, the American proposal also stated that its so-called "reciprocity" should be "within the scope of (the American) Constitution and existing American laws and regulations," and according to American immigration law, the United States cannot guarantee the kind of reciprocity that China has proposed.

In order to cover up this deceptive tactic of the United States, the US State Department also attempted to cover the sky with one hand, falsely accusing the Chinese side of "not being willing" to exchange journalists, saying that China is "not really interested" in exchanging journalists. It unreasonably said that China's proposal to first reach a formal agreement on the exchange of journalists based on the principle of equality and mutual benefit is "completely unacceptable."

The US State Department's statement still used the habitual posture of imperialists, saying that China refused to publish a statement "in accordance with" the direction of the American proposal, "and put forward their" "counter-proposal," "which once again shows that it is opposed to the reciprocal exchange of journalists."

After reading the above statement, US State Department spokesman White also made a statement, openly slandering, saying that China wanted to "send an intelligence officer listed on the staff list of a newspaper to the United States." He slandered Chinese journalists as "subversives" and said: "Under American law, subversives are not allowed to enter this country (the United States)."

When US Secretary of State Herter delivered a speech at the meeting of editors and publishers of the United Press International on September 8, he also greatly slandered China on the issue of the Sino-US exchange of journalists. He insisted on calling China's reasonable proposal to reach an agreement on the exchange of journalists based on the principle of true equality and mutual benefit as an attempt to "extract political concessions from us (the United States)," and clamored about this, saying that these conditions are "clearly unacceptable to the United States."

    歪曲中美会谈互派记者问题的真相
    美国务院发表声明欺世惑众
    妄图推卸美国阻挠达成协议的罪责
    新华社13日讯　华盛顿消息：美国国务院9月8日就中美大使会谈第一百次会议在互派记者问题上再度陷入僵局发表了一项完全歪曲事实、颠倒黑白的声明，妄图蒙骗世界舆论，把美国蓄意阻挠两国根据平等互惠原则互派记者的责任推到中国身上。
    美国国务院在这项声明中援引美国大使比姆在中美会谈中提出的建议，假惺惺地说什么美国一直在为实现中美双方互派记者“进行努力”，而且“随时准备根据同共产党中国平等互惠的原则互派记者”。但是，美国的建议又说它的所谓“互惠”是要“在（美国的）宪法和美国现行的有关法律和条例的范围内”，而根据美国的移民法，美国是不能保证给予中国所建议的那种互惠的。
    为了掩饰美国这种欺世惑众的手法，美国国务院还妄图只手遮天，诬蔑中国方面“不愿意”互派记者，说中国对互派记者“并不真正感兴趣”，它蛮横无理地说中国提出的根据平等互惠原则首先达成互派记者的正式协议的建议是“完全不能接受的”。
    美国国务院的声明仍然用帝国主义者惯有的姿态，说中国拒绝“按照”美国的建议的方针去发表声明，“并且提出了他们的”“反建议”，“这就再次表明它是反对互惠地互派记者的”。
    美国国务院发言人怀特在宣读了上述声明之后还发表谈话，公然含血喷人，说什么中国要把“一个列入一家报馆人员名单上的情报人员派往美国”。他诬蔑中国记者是“颠复分子”，并且说：“根据美国法律，颠复分子不准进入这个国家（美国）。”
    美国国务卿赫脱8日在合众国际社编辑和发行人会议上发表演说时，也就中美互派记者问题大肆诬蔑中国。他硬把中国关于根据真正平等互惠的原则达成互派记者协议这一合情合理的建议说成是要“榨取我们（美国）的政治让步”，并且就此叫嚷说，这些条件“美国显然不能接受。”
