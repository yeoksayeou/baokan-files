To Seize High Grain Yields, Pests Must Be Eliminated
    Red Flame Production Team Becomes Pest-Free Team
    Cheng Chaoyuan Leads Masses to Diligently Study and Master Pest Control Laws

    According to the Zhejiang Daily news: Cheng Chaoyuan, Deputy Director of the Suxi Commune in Yiwu County and Party Branch Secretary of the Red Flame Production Team, has been leading the masses on the agricultural production front for eight years, persevering in conducting large-scale scientific research, waging a relentless struggle against pests, and transforming the historically pest-ridden Red Flame Production Team into the first pest-free team in the county. Recently, Cheng Chaoyuan has been hired as a special researcher by the Zhejiang Academy of Agricultural Sciences; his Red Flame Production Team has also been hired as a special research station by the Zhejiang Academy of Agricultural Sciences.
    Cheng Chaoyuan only attended school for four years, but under the cultivation and education of the Party, he has a red heart to strive forward, break into the gate of science, and seize high yields. Long-term participation in labor practice has gradually mastered a set of agricultural operation techniques.
    Pests and diseases in the Red Flame Production Team have been harming the crops for years, seriously affecting the increase in production. In order to master the laws of pest occurrence and development and effective scientific prevention methods as soon as possible, Cheng Chaoyuan organized a scientific research group in 1955 according to the instructions of the superior Party committee. He was elected as the group leader. Cheng Chaoyuan implemented the research method of combining theory with practice within the group, leading the members to study scientific theoretical knowledge, carefully observe the occurrence and development of pests, and frequently conduct experiments and summarize experiences. At that time, he was both the director of the agricultural production cooperative and the Party branch secretary, and he was very busy, but he still insisted on research work. Countless nights, when people were already asleep, he was still concentrating on experiments under the light. His spirit of striving for strength greatly encouraged the members' confidence in marching toward science.
    In 1957, Cheng Chaoyuan led the research group to check the effect of rice borer control on late rice. When they pulled up the dead heart seedlings, they found that only 60% of the rice borers were killed. In order to find the reason, he launched the group members to discuss and conduct field inspections many times. Everyone believed that this was because the rice borers had drilled into the rice hearts and were not easily poisoned. Cheng Chaoyuan thought: The rice borers won't drill into the rice hearts immediately after hatching, wouldn't it be possible to prevent them early? Later, they finally found the reason in the books.
    In 1958, when the rice borers hatched, under the guidance of Comrade Jiang Gongxian of the district agricultural technology station, they learned the ability to check larvae, which enabled them to carry out prevention during the period when the larvae gathered on the leaf tips. As a result, the insecticidal rate reached more than 98%. Since then, Cheng Chaoyuan realized the importance of carefully observing the activity of insects. Because of their careful observation and painstaking research, they quickly mastered the activity patterns of rice planthoppers and leafhoppers. In the morning and after 3 pm, these insects are generally on the rice leaves, and when it is hot at noon, they climb down the rice leaves and stop on the rice stalks. Therefore, they experimented and found that the best effect is achieved when applying medicine at 3 pm when the insects are on the rice leaves. In August 1959, the scientific and technological research group adopted this method, and only used one hundred catties of 666 powder, and the three generations of rice borers, rice planthoppers, and leafhoppers on one hundred and three mu of continuous late rice were all eliminated. Later, after several mass pest control campaigns, the Red Flame Team eliminated pests for the first time in history and became the first pest-free team in the county. Representatives from all over the county came to visit in an endless stream. After seeing it, they all said: "This is truly an unprecedented miracle!"
    Now, the scientific and technological research group of the Red Flame Production Team has more and more research projects, and the scope of research is also expanding, forming a mass movement where everyone learns science and everyone uses science.

    夺取粮食高产　必须消灭虫害
    红焰生产队成为无虫队
    程朝元领导群众刻苦钻研掌握了灭虫规律
    据浙江日报消息　义乌县苏溪公社副社长、红焰生产队党支部书记程朝元，在农业生产战线上，八年如一日地领导群众坚持大搞科学研究，与虫害开展无情的斗争，把历史上虫灾较严重的红焰生产队，变成了全县第一个无虫队。最近，程朝元已被浙江农业科学院聘为特约研究员；他所在的红焰生产队，也被浙江农业科学院聘为特约研究站。
    程朝元只读过四年书，但是由于他在党的培养教育下，有一颗发愤图强闯进科学大门夺取高产的红心；长期参加劳动实践，逐渐掌握了一套农事操作技术。
    红焰生产队病虫害连年为害，使增产受到了严重的影响。为了早日掌握虫害的发生发展规律和有效的科学防治方法，程朝元根据上级党委的指示，在1955年组织了科学研究小组。他被推选为小组长。程朝元在组内贯彻了理论联系实际的研究方法，领导组员钻研科学理论知识，精细观察虫害的发生、发展情况，经常进行试验和总结经验。当时，他既是农业生产合作社的社长，又担任党支部书记，工作很忙，但他仍能坚持研究工作。不知有多少个深夜，当人们都已入睡的时候，他还在灯光下专心一志地进行试验。他这种发愤图强的精神，大大鼓舞了组员们向科学进军的信心。
    1957年，程朝元带领研究组去检查晚稻治螟效果。他们拔起枯心苗一看，发现螟虫只杀死60％。为了寻找原因，他发动组员多次讨论和实地检查。大家认为这是由于螟虫钻入稻心，不易毒死的缘故。程朝元想：螟虫不会一孵化出来立刻就钻入稻心的，提早加以防治行不行呢？后来，他们从书本中终于找到了原因。
    1958年，到了螟虫孵化的时候，他们在区农业技术站蒋巩贤同志的指导下，学会了检查幼虫的本领，也就使他们能在幼虫群集在叶梢期间进行防治。结果杀虫率达98％以上。从此以后，程朝元体会到精心观察虫子活动情况的重要性。由于他们精心观察，刻苦钻研，迅速掌握了稻飞虱、浮尘子的活动规律，早上和下午三时以后，这些虫一般都在稻叶上，中午炎热的时候，都爬下稻叶停在稻秆上。因此，他们试验出：下午三时，当虫停在稻叶上时施药，效果最好。1959年8月，科学技术研究小组采取这个办法，只用了一百斤六六六粉，一百零三亩连作晚稻的三化螟、稻飞虱、浮尘子就全部被消灭掉。后来，又经过几次群众性的治虫运动，红焰队就第一次在历史上消灭了虫害，成为全县第一个无虫队。全县各地前来参观的代表络绎不绝。他们看后都说：“这真是空前未有过的奇迹！”
    现在，红焰生产队的科学技术研究小组，研究项目越来越多，研究的范围也越来越广，形成了人人学科学，个个用科学的群众运动。
