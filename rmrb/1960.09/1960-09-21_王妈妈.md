　　Mama Wang
　　In Bamu, there is a dilapidated temple by the street. Usually, no one pays much attention to it. The coal briquette factory uses it as a warehouse, and the courtyard is messy year-round. I had just returned to the city from the countryside when my neighbors asked me to take a look at the dilapidated temple. The two northern rooms had been turned into a dining hall, and the courtyard was planted with flowers and plants. Mama Wang saw me and greeted me: "Look! This place has changed!" This woman, who used to be quiet, is now talkative and smiling. I said, "This courtyard is so quiet," she said, "It's really lively after work," I said, "It's so good that the city has set up a commune," she said, "Everyone is happy and everyone is smiling." I praised her for being the canteen manager, and she said, "It's just that my accounting is a bit slow," I praised this new collective life, and she said, "How could there be today without the leadership of the Communist Party." Seeing her bright eyes, overflowing with the pride of an ordinary woman, she introduced me to the garden she cultivated with her own hands, as if to say: The future of the commune is like these red flowers and green grass!

　　王妈妈
　　巴牧临街有一座破庙，平时谁也不去细瞧，煤球厂把它当堆栈，院子里长年乱糟糟。我从乡下刚刚回城，邻居们要我去破庙瞧瞧，两间北屋变成了饭厅，院坝里种满一片花草。王妈妈看见我，迎上来：“瞧！这地方可变样了！”过去这位不爱说话的妇女，如今变得有说有笑。我说：“这院子多么安静”，她说：“下班时可真热闹”，我说：“城里办起公社多好”，她说：“人人乐来人人笑。”我赞美她当了食堂管理员，她说：“就是算账慢得心焦”，我赞美这新的集体生活，她说：“没有共产党领导怎么
  会有今朝。”看见她那双发亮的眼睛，洋溢着一个普通妇女的骄傲，她向我介绍亲手培植的园圃，好像说：公社的前途就像这红
  花绿草！
