Xinhua News Agency, 16th: Washington Dispatch: In order to intensify interference in Laos and exacerbate the tense situation in Southeast Asia, the U.S. government announced on the 15th that it would send more armed forces to operate in the South China Sea region.

According to a U.S. Department of Defense spokesman to reporters, as part of the U.S. plan to "intensify (military) preparations" in the region, a 1,100-member Marine Corps attack team stationed in Kaohsiung, Taiwan, is scheduled to travel to the South China Sea on two warships on the 16th, and will be "ready for combat at any time." The U.S. aircraft carrier "Hornet," which operates in the region, accompanied by three destroyers, is also scheduled to leave Manila on the 15th for the South China Sea. Some of the aircraft on the aircraft carrier have been withdrawn and replaced by a squadron of helicopters that can transport the Marine Corps ashore in amphibious warfare. In addition, another U.S. Navy assault aircraft carrier and several destroyers have long been operating in the South China Sea.

State Department Press Officer Ripo also spoke to reporters on the 15th about the U.S. government's intensification of troop movements to the Southeast Asian region. He tried his best to clamor that it is "necessary" for the U.S. Seventh Fleet to continue to "stay on the Far East sea" and "always be vigilant." Ripo tried to deny that this aggressive U.S. action was related to the Laotian situation, but a dispatch issued by United Press International on the 15th already pointed out that "apparently because of the riots in the Southeast Asian kingdom of Laos, the U.S. Navy is currently deploying an aircraft carrier, destroyers, and a Marine Corps battalion landing force in the South China Sea."

The U.S. State Department issued a statement on the 10th regarding the situation in Laos, preparing for U.S. intervention in Laos. The statement said that "any other foreign country or its agents using" the "existing riots" in Laos to "directly or indirectly interfere" would cause the United States to "immediately consider this related to itself."

The U.S. State Department's statement is a signal for U.S. armed intervention in Laos, and the U.S. movement of warships and armed forces to the South China Sea cannot be regarded as an actual deployment to intervene in Laos.

According to a report by United Press International today, the Thai authorities are "excited" about the activities of U.S. imperialism in deploying intervention forces in the South China Sea and threatening Laos. On the 15th, Thai Prime Minister Nai Sarit told reporters that "the moment for Thailand to make a decision is approaching." He also revealed that Thailand had contacted the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization at the diplomatic level regarding the situation in Laos, and that Thailand had explained the situation in Laos to the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization.

### 加紧干涉老挝　恶化东南亚局势  美国调兵到南中国海挑衅

    加紧干涉老挝　恶化东南亚局势
    美国调兵到南中国海挑衅
    新华社16日讯　华盛顿消息：为了加紧干涉老挝，加剧东南亚的紧张局势，美国政府15日宣布增派武装部队到南中国海地区活动。
    据美国国防部发言人对新闻记者说，作为美国在这个地区“加紧进行（军事）准备”的计划的一个部分，美国驻在台湾高雄的一千一百人的一个海军陆战队攻击队已定于16日乘坐两艘军舰前往南中国海，并且“随时准备战斗”。在这个地区活动的美国航空母舰“大黄蜂号”，在三艘驱逐舰的护送下也定于15日离开马尼拉前往南中国海。这艘航空母舰上的一些飞机已经撤出，而代之以一个中队的可以在登陆战中把海军陆战队送上岸的直升飞机。此外，美国海军还有另外一艘攻击航空母舰和几艘驱逐舰早就在南中国海活动。
    国务院新闻发布官里普15日也对新闻记者谈到了美国政府加紧向东南亚地区调动军队这件事。他竭力叫嚷美国的第七舰队目前“有必要”继续“呆在远东海面”和“经常保持警惕”。里普力图否认美国这一侵略性行动同老挝局势有关系，但是合众国际社在15日发出的一条消息中已经指出，“显然由于老挝这个东南亚王国里的骚乱，美国海军目前正在南中国海部署航空母舰、驱逐舰和海军陆战队的一营登陆部队。”
    美国国务院在10日曾经就老挝局势发表一项声明，为美国干涉老挝进行准备，这项声明说什么“任何其他外国或其代理人利用”老挝“存在的骚乱情况直接或间接进行干涉”将使美国“立即认为这同它自己有关”。
    美国国务院的这项声明就是美国武装干涉老挝的讯号，而美国调动军舰和武装力量到南中国海不能不认为就是要干涉老挝的一个实际部署。
    据合众国际社今天报道，泰国当局对美帝国主义在南中国海部署干涉力量、威胁老挝的活动“感到兴奋”。15日，泰国总理乃沙立曾经对记者说，“泰国作出决定的时刻已经接近”。他并且透露，泰国已在外交一级就老挝局势同东南亚条约组织接触，泰国已经向东南亚条约组织说明了老挝局势。
