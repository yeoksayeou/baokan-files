Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, 20th: Changge No. 3 Middle School in Henan Province, in order to implement the ideology of taking agriculture as the foundation, actively serves agricultural production and grain production, and at the same time effectively improves the teaching quality of the school.

　　Changge No. 3 Middle School attaches great importance to appropriately linking teaching content and teaching activities, scientific research and labor classes with rural production and the central work of the people's communes. The experimental farm, which serves as the school's teaching and labor base, has been combined with the high-yield fields of the people's communes outside the school. Students not only labor and research at the school's experimental farm, but also a group of students take turns going to the commune's high-yield fields to labor during their spare time every day. During the summer vacation this year, almost all students returned home to participate in the high-yield field activities and the fight against drought. Hundreds of students established experimental fields with the peasants in the brigades. Many students ate, lived, and researched in the experimental fields, which were deeply praised by the peasants. The school has helped many production teams in the surrounding area to establish scientific research groups, and the students are the technical backbone of the research groups. The school has established a regular and fixed linkage system with the four nearby production brigades to provide comprehensive support in terms of labor, chemical fertilizers, pesticides, science and technology, and cultural learning. When it is busy with farming or there are sudden production tasks, all teachers and students go all out, which greatly helps these four production brigades. In terms of teaching content, in order to meet the needs of rural production, the science and physics department has added content such as mechanics, internal combustion, soil analysis, and chemical fertilizers; the mathematics class taught probability theory and operations research earlier in order to help the commune do a good job in surveying, calculation, and transportation; the biology department systematically summarized the experience of Ma Tongyi, a famous soil expert in Changge, and added it to the textbook, and conducted a soil census for the local people's commune, which played a great role in the rational layout of the commune's crops; the language and political classes selected a large number of articles and news reports on developing the national economy with agriculture as the foundation. The school also invites graduates who participated in labor production in the countryside to the school for discussions in order to further improve teaching content and teaching activities and serve agricultural production more. All teachers and students of the school proposed that, without affecting teaching, they should offer advice and suggestions in all aspects for agricultural production and grain production, and be a pioneer in supporting agriculture.

　　Changge No. 3 Middle School is one of the national advanced units that have better implemented the party's education policy. They have always attached great importance to combining teaching with local agricultural production and the central work of the countryside. They have jointly researched and cooperated with local farms and cultivated corn varieties suitable for local breeding, which have been promoted in the commune, resulting in a multiple increase in yield. The school's experimental farm has attracted farmers and cadres from the surrounding area for several years, and the commune party committee regards it as its own "technical training class." In the past two years, the school has also supported the commune with more than 300,000 catties of fertilizer, more than 10,000 catties of new varieties and a large number of sweet potato seedlings, assisted in harvesting wheat on more than 10,000 mu, and dug tens of thousands of cubic meters of soil. In the first half of this year, the school's iron factory manufactured more than 7,000 pieces of farm implements for the commune. At the same time, the teaching quality of Changge No. 3 Middle School has consistently maintained the highest level in the county for several years, and this year it is still among the best.

　　积极支援农业生产有效提高教学质量
　　长葛三中深入贯彻教育方针
    新华社郑州20日电　河南省长葛县第三中学在师生中贯彻以农业为基础的思想，积极为农业生产、为增产粮食服务，同时有效地提高了学校的教学质量。
    长葛三中很重视把教学内容和教学活动、科学研究和劳动课，同农村生产、同人民公社的中心工作适当地联系起来。作为学校教学基地和劳动基地的试验农场，已经和校外人民公社的丰产方结合，学生们不仅在学校的试验农场劳动和研究，而且每天课余时间都有一部分学生轮流到公社的丰产方劳动。今年暑期，几乎全部学生都回家参加大队丰产方的活动和抗旱斗争，有几百名学生在大队里和农民一起建立了试验田，许多学生吃、住、研究在试验田里，深受农民赞扬。学校帮助周围许多生产小队建立了科学研究小组，学生就是研究小组的技术骨干。学校和附近的四个生产大队建立了经常的固定的挂钩制度，在劳力、化肥、农药、科学技术、文化学习等各方面进行全面地支援，农忙或者有突击性生产任务时，全体师生更是全力以赴，对这四个生产大队帮助很大。在教学内容方面，为了适应农村生产的需要，理化科增加了力学、内燃、土壤分析、化肥等内容；数学课提早讲授了概论率和运筹学，以便帮助公社搞好测量、计算和交通运输等工作；生物科系统总结了长葛著名的土壤专家马同义的经验，增加到教材中来，并且为所在地的人民公社进行了土壤普查，对公社农作物的合理布局起了很大作用；语文课和政治课选进了大量的有关发展国民经济以农业为基础的文章和通讯报告。学校还邀请在农村参加劳动生产的毕业生到学校座谈，以便进一步改进教学内容和教学活动，更多地为农业生产服务。学校的全体师生提出：在不影响教学的原则下，要从各方面为农业生产，为增产粮食献计献策，作一个支援农业的尖兵。
    长葛三中是贯彻党的教育方针比较好的全国先进单位之一。他们一向比较重视使教学和当地农业生产、农村中心工作结合。他们和本地农场共同研究协作，已培育出适合本地繁育的玉米品种，在公社推广，使产量成倍地增加。学校的试验农场，几年来都吸引着周围的农民和干部，公社党委把它作为自己的“技术训练班”。两年多来，学校还支援了公社三十多万斤肥料，一万多斤新品种和大量的红芋苗，协助收麦一万多亩，挖土几万方。今年上半年，学校铁工厂为公社制造了七千多件农具。与此同时，长葛三中的教学质量几年来一直保持全县最高的水平，今年仍然名列前茅。
