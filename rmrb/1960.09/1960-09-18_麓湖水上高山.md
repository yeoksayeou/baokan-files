    ?Luhu Lake's Waterborne Mountain by Our Correspondent Huang Changlu
          An Ancient Myth
    Legend has it that a long, long time ago, Tonghai County in central Yunnan Province was a vast ocean. A deity known as the "Ancestor of Dragon Subduing," Li Panfu, passed by and used his tin staff to poke a hole in the flood-submerged land, causing the floodwaters to recede, revealing fields, villages, and towns. The deity then grabbed a handful of black beans and plugged the hole, allowing the remaining water to accumulate in the low-lying areas, forming ?Luhu Lake, covering an area of 72,000 mu.

    The deity subdued the floods but did not solve the problem of irrigating the fields for the people. Tonghai County's topography resembles a pot, with high mountains surrounding a sunken middle, and ?Luhu Lake is like the bottom of the pot, with fields located on the sloping sides. The fields are higher than the water level, making it visible but unusable. Over 90% of the county's rice paddies rely on water drawn from ?Luhu Lake for irrigation. Before liberation, farmers lacked the means to lift water, so they could only plant 60,000 mu of rice in the lower areas near the lake, while large tracts of higher land were forced to grow coarse grains. At the time, a folk song circulated: "Beautiful Tonghai Dam, the Dragon King sits beneath the lake, planting rice depends on water wheels, eating rice depends on Ningzhou Dam (nearby Huaning County)."
        If the Heavens Don't Rain, People Will
    This year, Tonghai County encountered a severe drought unprecedented in its history. Since the beginning of the year, there has not been a single major rain for seven consecutive months, and the rainfall in the first half of the year was more than half less than the drought year of 1958. All 120,000 mu of rice paddies in the county were cracked open, with "wind blowing sand, and fields drying up after rain." The water level of ?Luhu Lake also dropped by four or five feet, rendering twenty-six out of the thirty-one pumping stations along the lake unable to draw water.

    It was the Party that led the 130,000 people of all ethnic groups in the county to withstand this severe drought and turn a disaster year into a bumper year. At the beginning of the year, after learning from meteorological forecasts that there would be a major drought, the county Party committee issued a mobilization call to the whole county: "If the heavens don't rain, people will rain, and even if a single drop doesn't fall, we will ensure planting." All county offices were moved to the countryside, and all levels of leading cadres went deep into the front lines of drought resistance, with the county Party secretary going to the most difficult communes, the commune Party secretaries going to the most difficult management districts, and the management district cadres going to the most difficult production teams, to command drought resistance. A powerful water lifting force consisting of nearly a thousand pumping machines, animal-powered waterwheels, and windmills, as well as tens of thousands of people, arrayed themselves on the shores of ?Luhu Lake to wage war against the drought demon.

    As the lake water receded and the pumping machines could not draw water, people dug water diversion channels and built dams to raise the water level before pumping; if the fields were too high for one pumping machine to reach, they used two; if two were not enough, they used three. The highest fields used a chain of seven pumping machines, plus forty-seven waterwheels, to lift the lake water over two mountain ridges and through a ten-mile route before it flowed into the rice paddies. The soil near the lake is very loose, and the water would dry up by evening after being irrigated in the morning, so people pumped water again the next day and continued to irrigate, persevering until the water was sufficient.

    ?Luhu Lake is higher in the west and lower in the east. By the time of transplanting, the water in the west of the lake had dried up, and 40,000 mu of rice paddies could not be irrigated. The county Party committee decided to build a five-mile-long water diversion channel in the center of the lake. The mud in the center of the lake was as soft as cotton, and people sank into it up to their chests when they stepped on it. But as soon as the county Party committee issued a call, thousands of commune members, factory workers, office cadres, school teachers, and county town residents immediately came to the lake. The spring in the Yunnan plateau was still a bit chilly, and the county Party secretary was the first to take off his cotton clothes, shoes, and socks, and took the lead in jumping into the mud, and people followed one by one. Hu Yongcong, the branch secretary of the Jinshan Management District of Jinshan Commune, had just returned from the hospital. The leadership wanted him to rest more, but when he thought that building the channel could ensure timely planting, he resolutely jumped into the mud with everyone.
        Enthusiastic Support
    Just as people were fighting day and night with the mud in ?Luhu Lake, the news reached Kunming, three hundred miles away, and they immediately tried to support their class brothers in Tonghai County. Kunming Shipping Company decided to send a dredger from Dianchi Lake to help, but a dredger weighed twelve tons, and ordinary cars could not carry it at all. What to do? The Yunnan Provincial Economic Commission learned of this difficulty and immediately ordered a twelve-ton truck that was heading to Guiyang to be intercepted on the way to transport the dredger. The dredger was very large, and the roads in the mountainous areas of the plateau were steep and winding, so it was very difficult and troublesome to transport the dredger through such roads. However, when the driver heard that it was being transported to support drought resistance, he readily accepted. He brought all kinds of road repair tools with him, opening roads through mountains and building bridges over water, and finally delivered the dredger safely to ?Luhu Lake.

    Whatever was needed for drought resistance, support came from all directions. Hearing that the pumping station needed power, the county's rice mill sent its rice milling power machine, the water conservancy construction site sent its tractor, the city sent its generator, and even the cinema sent its movie projector power machine. This brotherly care and communist spirit greatly encouraged the people fighting on the front lines of drought resistance. On the third day of the Lesser Fullness solar term, which was the most tense moment of transplanting, one of the three pumping machines at the Luoshuidong Pumping Station suddenly broke down. According to past experience, the machine had to be transported to Kunming for repair, which would take a month to return. Shen Shixiao, the person in charge of the pumping station's Party branch, said to everyone: "The 30,000 people of Yangguang Commune rely on these three machines for food, and we must find a way to repair them before the end of transplanting!"

    Since the station itself had no repair capabilities, it immediately sought help from higher authorities. The director of the prefectural industrial and communications bureau replied to them: "You dismantle the machine as quickly as possible, and I will immediately notify the Yuxi Hongtashan Machinery Factory to repair it for you." It was already evening, and Shen Shixiao immediately convened an emergency Party branch meeting without even having dinner. Shen Shixiao made a mobilization at the meeting: "Now, time is grain, and if we dismantle the machine one day earlier, the commune can increase its grain production by several thousand or tens of thousands of jin. Can we carry out a concentrated effort to dismantle the machine tonight?" The seven Party members unanimously expressed their determination to the branch: "We guarantee to complete the task."

    This was an unusual night. The Communist Party members came to the machine room first, and the Communist Youth League members and all the employees of the station also responded to the call of the branch. People worked tensely all night, and the next morning, the car carrying the machine drove to Yuxi. When the Hongtashan Machinery Factory learned that this was a machine to support agriculture, it immediately concentrated its efforts and repaired it in a concentrated effort in two days and two nights at a speed that broke with convention. On the seventh day, this pumping machine was reinstalled in the Luoshuidong Pumping Station, spewing thick columns of water into the thirsty rice paddies.
        The Masters of ?Luhu Lake
    More than a hundred days and nights of intense work have passed, and people have extracted 50 million cubic meters of water from ?Luhu Lake, pouring it into rice paddies several meters to dozens of meters above the lake surface. People say that if they had to use hand-operated waterwheels like in the past, even if the people of the county worked day and night for two years, they would not be able to wheel such much water! This water allowed the 120,000 mu of rice around the lake to be fully irrigated, producing dense and fertile ears of rice. When the farmers saw such crops, they all said: "We would not know it was a drought year if we hadn't lived through the drought."

    Not knowing that it was a drought year after living through the drought reflects that the people of Tonghai have become the masters of ?Luhu Lake. There is a village called Haidong on the north shore of the lake, which people used to call "Old Gourd Village." Why did it get this disgraceful nickname? Like the hundreds of villages along the shores of ?Luhu Lake, although it was close to the lake and the lake water could be seen upon leaving the house, it was impossible to utilize it in the past, so they had to use the fertile land to plant pumpkins and coarse grains to make a living. After the cooperativization in 1956, the village relied on the strength of the collective to force water up by manual waterwheel to plant more than 700 mu of fields. In 1958, people's communes were established, and the commune established pumping stations in other villages, and at this time, they planted 100 mu of rice paddies by using machine water lifting half and manual waterwheel half. With the development of the economy of the people's communes, this year, with the support of other management districts, the village built its own pumping station and used all machine water lifting to plant 1,400 mu of rice paddies. Now, this village is full of green rice paddies in front and behind. When we asked about the story of "Old Gourd Village," Li Yunchong, a 75-year-old commune member, told us: "This name is outdated, our place has become a granary!"

    I climbed up Xishan Mountain south of Tonghai City and looked around. ?Luhu Lake was as calm as a mirror, and 120,000 mu of fragrant rice paddies were like green carpets spread around the lake. Seeing this beautiful landscape, I couldn't help but think of the myth of "Subduing the Dragon and Opening the Sea." Who opened up thousands of hectares of good land on the shores of the lake? Who tamed ?Luhu Lake and brought water up the mountain slopes? It's not deities, but the people of the Mao Zedong era.

    ?麓湖水上高山	本报记者　黄昌禄
          古老的神话
    相传在很早很早以前，云南高原中部的通海县是一片汪洋大海。有一位号称“除龙祖师”的神仙李畔富路过此地，用锡杖在洪水淹没的大地上戳开一个落水洞，洪水下落，才出现了田园、村庄和城镇。神仙然后抓起一把黑豆塞住落水洞，让剩下的水蓄积在低地，变成面积七万二千亩的?麓湖。
    神仙降服了洪水，但并没有替人民解决田地的灌溉问题。通海县的地形很像一口锅，四围是高山，中间凹下去，?麓湖犹如锅底，田地都在倾斜的锅边上。田高水低，看得见却用不上，全县90％以上的稻田都靠从?麓湖中提水灌溉。解放前，农民无力提水，只能在湖畔较低地方栽上六万亩水稻，大片的高田被迫种了杂粮，湖边的水田也是十年九灾。当时流传着这样的歌谣：“好个通海坝，龙王坐湖下，栽田靠车水，吃米要靠宁州坝（附近的华宁县）”。
        天不下雨人下雨
    今年，通海县又碰到历史上少见的严重干旱。开年以来，连续七个月没有下过一场大雨，上半年的降雨量比大旱的1958年还减少一半以上。全县十二万亩稻田都干得裂开了嘴，“风吹沙起，雨过田干”。?麓湖的水位也下落了四、五尺，在沿湖三十一座抽水站中，有二十六座不能从湖中抽水。
    是党，领着全县十三万各族人民抗住了这场严重的干旱，把灾年变成了丰年。年初，县委从气象预报中知道今年将有大旱以后，即向全县人民发出了“天不下雨人下雨，滴雨不下保栽插”的动员号召，全县的机关都搬到乡下办公，各级领导干部全部深入到抗旱的第一线，县委书记到最困难的公社，公社党委书记到最困难的管理区，管理区干部到最困难的生产队，指挥抗旱。由近千台抽水机、畜力水车和风力水车以及上万人组成的强大提水队伍，在?麓湖边摆开阵势，向旱魔开战。
    湖水下落，抽水机抽不出水，人们就挖引水渠、筑坝，把湖水的水位提高以后再抽；田太高，一台抽水机抽不上去，就用两台；两台还不行，就用三台，最高的田是用七台抽水机连接起来，再加上四十七张水车，使湖水翻过了两座山头，经过十里长的路程，才流进稻田。湖边的田土质结构都很疏松，早上灌满了水，晚上就干了，人们第二天又抽水继续灌，百折不挠，直到将水灌足为止。
    ?麓湖西高东低，快到栽插时，湖西的水已经干涸，有四万亩稻田无法提水灌溉。县委决定在湖心修一条五里长的引水渠，湖心的稀泥软得像棉花团，人踩上去就往下陷，稀泥齐胸。但县委刚一号召，数千个公社社员、工厂职工、机关干部、学校教师和县城居民立即来到湖边。云南高原的春天还有几分寒意，县委书记第一个脱去棉衣、鞋袜，带头跳进了稀泥里，人们跟着一个个跳了下去。金山公社金山管理区的支部书记胡永从刚住医院回来不久，领导上要他多注意休息，可是他想到修通水渠可以及时栽插，便毅然同大家一起跳进泥里。
        热情的支援
    正当人们站在?麓湖中与烂泥日夜搏斗的时候，消息传到了三百里外的昆明，这里立即想方设法支援通海县的阶级弟兄。昆明市航运公司决定把滇池里的挖泥船送去支援，可是，一只挖泥船有十二吨重，普通的汽车根本没法载运，怎么办？这个困难被云南省经济委员会知道了，他们立即下令把正在驶往贵阳的一辆载重十二吨的大卡车从半路截回来，装运挖泥船。挖泥船的体积很大，而高原山区的公路又是坡大、弯多，载着挖泥船通过这种公路，真是又困难又麻烦的事。可是，驾驶员一听说是运去支援抗旱的，便欣然接受。他随身带上了各种修路的工具，逢山开路，遇水搭桥，终于把挖泥船安全送到了?麓湖。
    抗旱需要什么，四面八方就支援什么。听说抽水机站需要动力，县里的碾米厂把碾米的动力机送来了，水利工地把拖拉机送来了，城里把发电机送来了，电影院也把放电影的动力机送来了，远在昆明市的云南内燃机厂也及时运来了煤气机。这种兄弟般的关怀和共产主义风格，大大鼓舞了战斗在抗旱第一线的人们。进入小满节的第三天，正是栽插最紧张的时刻。落水洞抽水站的三台抽水机突然坏了一台。按过去的经验，要把机器运到昆明去修理，这样来回需要一个月。抽水机站党支部负责人沈世孝向大家说：“杨广公社三万多人吃饭就靠着这三台机器，我们一定要想办法在栽插结束前修好！”
    站里自己没有修理力量，马上向上级求援。专区的工交局长答复他们：“你们尽可能快把机器拆下来，我马上通知玉溪红塔山机械厂给你们修。”这时天已傍晚，沈世孝连饭也顾不得吃，马上召开了一次紧急的党支部大会。沈世孝在会上作了动员：“现在，时间就是粮食，我们早把机器拆下来一天，公社就可以增加几千几万斤粮食。能不能在今天晚上突击把机器拆下来？”七个党员一致向支部表示了决心：“我们保证完成任务。”
    这是一个不平常的夜晚。共产党员首先来到机器房，共青团员和全站的职工也响应支部的号召来了。人们紧张地工作了一个通宵，第二天早上，汽车载着这台机器驶往玉溪。红塔山机械厂知道这是支援农业的机器，立即集中力量，以打破常规的速度，两天两夜就突击修好了。第七天，这台抽水机又重新安装在落水洞抽水站里，向干渴的稻田喷吐着粗大的水柱。
        ?麓湖的主人
    一百多个日日夜夜紧张地过去了，人们从?麓湖里提出五千万立方米的水，倾入离湖面几米至几十米高的稻田。人们说，要是像过去用双手车水，全县人民日夜不停地车两年，也车不了这么多的水呀！这些水，让湖周围的十二万亩稻谷，得到充分的灌溉，吐出了密实而肥硕的谷穗。农民看见这样的庄稼，都说：“过了旱年不知旱”。
    过了旱年不知旱，反映了通海人民已经变成了?麓湖的主人。湖的北岸有个海东村，过去人们都叫它作“老瓜寨”。为什么会得这个不光彩的绰号呢？这里和?麓湖沿岸的上百个村子一样，虽然靠近湖边，出门就望见湖水，可是以前却无法利用它，只好把肥沃的土地点南瓜、杂粮来糊口。1956年合作化以后，村里依靠集体的力量，硬用人力车水栽了七百多亩田。1958年办起了人民公社，公社在其它村建立了抽水机站，这时半靠机器提水、半靠人力车水栽了一百亩水稻。随着人民公社经济的发展，今年村里在其它管理区的支援下，自己修建了一座抽水机站，全部用机器提水，栽下了一千四百亩稻田。如今，这个村子，村前、村后全是绿汪汪的水稻。当我们问起“老瓜寨”的故事时，七十五岁的老社员李云崇对我们说：“这名字过时了，我们这里变成米粮仓啦！”
    我登上通海城南的秀山，极目四眺，?麓湖平静如镜，十二万亩香稻像一块块绿色地毯铺在湖的四边。看见这锦绣山河，我不禁又想起了“降龙开海”的神话来。是谁，在湖畔开出了良田万顷？是谁，驯服了?麓湖，让水上山坡？不是神仙，而是毛泽东时代的人。
