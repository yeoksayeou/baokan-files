    Save Firewood and Grass, Manage Firewood and Grass Well	Excerpt from Xinhua Daily

    Regarding the issue of saving and managing firewood and grass, some comrades still consider it a trivial matter, not worth focusing on. Some believe that with continuous leaps in production, grass is abundant, and with the summer harvest just passed and the autumn harvest approaching, there is plenty of grass and no need to worry. Some production brigades and teams only keep records of grain and not of grass; they are generous in their use of firewood and grass, only focusing on the immediate needs and lacking long-term planning. As a result, when the lean season arrives, to solve the problem of grass shortage, they often have to arrange a lot of manpower to gather firewood and grass, or send a large number of people to purchase and transport firewood and grass from afar. This causes a waste of labor and affects current production.

    There is great potential for saving firewood and grass. Currently, the vast majority of firewood and grass is used as fuel. All localities should put their minds to work and make great efforts to save fuel grass. It is necessary to reduce the consumption of firewood and grass as much as possible through measures such as reforming stoves. In this regard, the Yancheng and Huaiyin special districts have set examples and made remarkable achievements. For example, the small-mouthed back-draft heat-preserving stove widely promoted in the Yancheng special district can reduce the daily living grass consumption per person from about two catties to less than one catty. If this type of small-mouthed back-draft heat-preserving stove is universally promoted in the rural areas of the province, more than 120 million dan of fuel grass will be saved annually. There are also many ways to save grass in industrial production, especially in those factories that use firewood and grass as raw materials. As long as they are careful in their calculations and block loopholes of waste, they can save a lot of firewood and grass.

    While vigorously saving firewood and grass, we must also pay attention to strengthening the management of firewood and grass. We must formulate practical and feasible grass-use plans based on the principles of overall consideration, foresight, reasonable arrangement, and economical use. Only in this way can we prevent the occurrence of focusing on one thing while losing sight of another and the phenomenon of being lax at the beginning and tight at the end, and can we prioritize and ensure that the use of grass in all aspects is implemented. When formulating grass-use plans, it is necessary to take into account the needs of the state, the collective, and the commune members. First of all, it is necessary to ensure the use of grass for fuel and feed, and to reserve enough according to the population and the number of livestock. Secondly, it is necessary to ensure the use of grass for repairing houses and pigsties, and appropriately increase the use of grass for fertilizer. Thirdly, it is necessary to ensure the completion of the state's procurement plan for industrial raw materials. As for the industrial materials used by counties and communes, they should be arranged more if there is more surplus grass after meeting the above three needs, and less if there is less. It is not enough to have a plan; it is also necessary to establish a set of systems and methods for managing firewood and grass, strengthen the storage of firewood and grass, and effectively prevent the mildew and loss of firewood and grass. The "three fixings and one reward" system implemented by the Xinsheng Brigade of the Lujia Commune in Kunshan County is a good way to strengthen the management of firewood and grass. They contract the output of firewood and grass to the production teams in the same way as grain output. At the same time, they set the task of selling firewood and grass to the state, set the amount of grass for the canteen, and set the amount of grass for feed, fertilizer, and repairing houses and livestock sheds, ensuring that the needs of all aspects are met. In the storage of firewood and grass, they also base themselves on the system of the people's commune, combining brigades and teams, and assigning special personnel to manage them separately. The firewood and grass sold to the state and the public grass are managed by the brigade, and the grass used by the canteen and the fertilizer grass used by the team are managed by the team according to the prescribed quota, and it is clearly announced that savings are kept by oneself, and shortages are not replenished, in order to encourage economical use of grass. The custodians who store firewood and grass are also clearly responsible for implementing a unified revenue and expenditure system, and the communes and teams conduct regular inspections and comparisons to ensure that they are well managed from beginning to end.

    While saving firewood and grass and managing firewood and grass well, we must produce as much firewood and grass as possible. Broadening the sources of grass and actively increasing the output of firewood and grass is the fundamental way to solve the firewood and grass problem. For example, when harvesting crops, both grain and grass should be grasped together, emphasizing both grains in the granary and every blade of grass in the stack, collecting everything cleanly. In some areas along the rivers, lakes, and riverbanks, reeds can be planted on a large scale to open up grass sources. Local Newspaper Commentary Excerpts

### 节约柴草　管好柴草

专栏：地方报纸评论摘要

    节约柴草　管好柴草	摘自新华日报
    关于节约柴草、管好柴草的问题，还有些同志认为是小事，不值得抓一抓，管一管。有的认为连年生产跃进，草丰收，夏收过去不久，秋收又要来了，草有的是，用不着焦心。有些生产大队和小队，只有粮账，而无草账；对柴草宽打宽用，只顾眼前，而缺乏长远打算。结果，到青黄不接的时候，为了解决缺草的问题，往往要安排很多的人力去拾柴草，或者要派出一大批人，到远处去购运柴草。这就造成了劳动力的浪费，影响了当前的生产。
    节约柴草的潜力很大。目前绝大部分柴草都是用作燃料，各地就要在节省燃料用草的问题上大动脑筋，大做文章。要通过改革炉灶等措施，尽量降低柴草的消耗量。在这方面盐城、淮阴两专区已经树立了榜样，作出了显著的成绩。如盐城专区全面推广的小口回风保温灶，就能使每人每天的生活用草，从原来的二斤左右，降低到一斤以下。如果全省农村都普遍推广这种小口回风保温灶，一年就要节省烧草一亿二千多万担。工业生产上节约用草的门路也不少，特别是以那些以柴草作为原料生产的工厂，只要精打细算，阻塞浪费的漏洞，就可以节省出很多的柴草来。
    在大力节约柴草的同时，还要注意加强柴草的管理。要根据统筹兼顾、瞻前顾后、合理安排、节约使用的原则，制订出切实可行的用草计划。只有这样，才能防止产生顾此失彼和前松后紧的现象，才能分别轻重缓急，使各方面的用草都落实下来。在制订用草计划时，要兼顾国家、集体和社员三者的需要。首先要保证燃料、饲料用草，要按人口、按牲畜头数留足。其次是保证房屋、猪舍修缮用草，适当的增加一些肥料用草。第三是保证国家收购工业用料计划的完成。至于县社工业用料，要在满足上述三方面需要以后，下余的草多就多安排，少就少安排。有了计划安排还不够，还要建立一套管理柴草的制度和方法，加强柴草的保管，切实防止柴草的霉烂和损失。昆山县绿葭公社新生大队实行的三定一奖制，是加强柴草管理的好办法。他们把柴草的产量和粮食产量一样包给生产小队，同时定卖给国家柴草的任务，定食堂用草，定饲料、肥料和修缮房屋、畜舍的用草，保证满足各方面的需要。在柴草的保管上，他们也根据人民公社的体制，以大队为基础，大、小队相结合，分别由专人进行保管。卖给国家的柴草和公用草就由大队负责保管，食堂用草以及小队的肥料用草，就按规定的定额归小队保管，并明确宣布，节约归己，用缺不补，以鼓励节约用草。对保管柴草的保管员也明确责任，执行统一收支制度，并由社队定期进行检查评比，保证从头管好，一管到底。
    在节约柴草，管好柴草的同时，要尽可能地多产柴草。广开草源，积极增加柴草的产量，这是解决柴草问题的根本办法。比如：在收获农作物时，收粮收草就要一齐抓，既强调颗粒归仓，也要强调寸草归垛，收净拾光。有些地区的沿江、沿湖及河道两岸，可以大种芦苇，开辟草源。地方报纸评论摘要
