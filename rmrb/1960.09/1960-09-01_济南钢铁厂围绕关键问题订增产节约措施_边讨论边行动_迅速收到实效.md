This Dispatch from Jinan, 31st of this month: The staff and workers of Jinan Steel Plant in Shandong Province seriously summarized and inspected the production and thrift situation in the first seven months, discussed and formulated a production increase and thrift plan for the next four months, and specific measures to realize the plan. They adopted the method of inspecting, discussing and acting at the same time, which rapidly increased production. The average daily output of pig iron in mid-August increased by 23.2% compared with early August; the pig iron qualification rate in the first five days of late August increased to 98.23%; the coke ratio and cost of ironmaking gradually decreased.

The plant, from workshop, furnace, team to individual, discussed and formulated production increase and thrift plans of higher every quarter, higher every month, higher every ten days, and put forward guarantee measures. Leading cadres and section staff also went deep into the front line of production, eating, living, working and consulting with workers, focusing on specific measures and attacking key production points. The whole plant has set off a competition upsurge of comprehensively leaping forward in quality and quantity. Focusing on the key issue of high-sulfur ore, in addition to resolutely implementing high-wind and high-temperature operations and vigorously increasing smelting intensity, the workers also adopted "one-stop" desulfurization measures from raw material management to desulfurization inside and outside the furnace, which rapidly improved the quality of pig iron, steadily increased output, and gradually reduced the coke ratio. For example, workers in Class B of No. 2, 255 cubic meter blast furnace of the first ironmaking workshop not only broke the record of producing 100 tons per shift, but also made all the pig iron produced from August 11 to 25 qualified.

The staff and workers of the raw material, machinery, power and transportation departments of the plant greatly promoted their enthusiasm and creativity in serving the blast furnace. In addition to striving to process raw materials to be dry, clean, fine, and uniform, raw material workers also paid attention to collecting scattered crushed ore and coke powder to provide the blast furnace with more "food." The raw material section of the second workshop actively sought to break through the key production problems, increasing the output of sintered ore by about 60%, and also significantly improving the iron content.

    济南钢铁厂围绕关键问题订增产节约措施
    边讨论边行动  迅速收到实效
    本报济南31日电　山东省济南钢铁厂职工认真总结检查前七个多月的生产和节约情况，讨论和制订今后四个月的增产节约计划和实现计划的具体措施，并采取了边检查、边讨论、边行动的办法，使生产迅速上升。生铁的平均日产量，8月中旬比上旬增长23.2％；生铁合格率，下旬前五天提高到98.23％；炼铁焦比和成本也逐步降低。
    这个厂从车间、炉子、班组到个人，都讨论和制订了季季高、月月高、旬旬高的增产节约计划，并且提出了保证措施。领导干部和科室人员也深入生产第一线，和工人同吃、同住、同劳动、同商量，大抓具体措施，围攻生产关键。全厂掀起了一个质量产量全面跃进的竞赛热潮。职工们针对高硫矿这一关键问题，除坚决实行大风、高温操作，大力提高冶炼强度外，还采取了从原料管理到炉内外脱硫的“一条龙”脱硫措施，使生铁质量迅速提高，产量稳步上升，焦比逐渐下降。如第一炼铁车间二号二百五十五立方米高炉乙班工人，不仅突破了班产百吨大关，而且从8月11日至25日所产生铁全部合格。
    这个厂的原料、机械、动力和运输等部门的职工，大大发扬了为高炉服务的积极性和创造性。原料工人除了力求把原料加工得干、净、细、匀等以外，还注意收集分散的碎矿石和焦炭末，供应高炉更多的“粮食”。第二车间原料工段积极设法突破生产关键，使烧结矿的产量增加60％左右，含铁品位也显著提高。
