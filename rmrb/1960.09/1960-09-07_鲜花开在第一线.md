    Flowers Bloom on the Front Line
    By our reporters Hua Lü and Gu Li
    A newcomer to the Fuxin mining area will find it is not so easy to locate leaders at all levels. Telephone calls often go unanswered, and even a visit to their offices often finds the door locked. From the Secretary of the Fuxin Municipal Party Committee down to the leaders of each pithead, going deep into the front line of production has become the norm. One can only find them relatively easily among the masses and on the production site. Their solid style of leadership in production has brought forth "flowers" in the production and construction of this mining area, leaving us with a deep impression.
        From Coal Loader to Hydraulic Transportation
    The Fuxin Coal Mine is the birthplace of the coal loader. Initially, we assumed that the coal loaders were commonly used in the underground coal mining faces here. In fact, it is not so. In Ping'an Mine, 80% of the working faces have abandoned the coal loader and coal conveyor, replaced by a newer method: hydraulic transportation. In the "experimental field" of Comrade Qiu Xinye, First Secretary of the Municipal Party Committee—the Third Coal Mining Section of the Fifth Pit of Ping'an Mine—we observed this new coal mining method. Descending to the coal mining face, we saw several workers had already drilled holes and loaded explosives. After the blast, workers manipulated a water gun, washing the loosened coal down into a trough, where it cascaded downward. The complex processes of coal loading, conveyor moving, pillar supporting, and pillar withdrawing, which we usually saw at the coal mining face, were now completely gone.
    Comrades from the mine told us the story of the birth of this new coal mining method. An old roadway above a tunneling face had accumulated water that needed to be drained regularly. As the water flowed over the tunneling face, it carried away coal dust. The tunneling workers came up with a solution: simply "using the enemy's strategy against him." After drilling and blasting, they used water to flush the coal, increasing coal transport efficiency by 80% compared to using coal conveyors. Secretary Qiu Xinye discovered this and immediately seized upon it. At the time, the transport on the working face was a weak link, due to the increased mining and tunneling efficiency. Inspired by the tunneling workers, Qiu Xinye decided to experiment with water transport in his "experimental field." Thanks to the leaders' keen awareness of the new thing and their resolute support, a completely new coal mining method took shape. After the Sixth Coal Mining Section of the Second Pit of Ping'an Mine promoted this new coal mining method, the working face design and roadway layout completely broke away from the old method of coal mining, and a comprehensive technical transformation was carried out. The average daily output increased more than twofold; pit props were basically unnecessary, reducing the cost per ton of coal by 82%; production became safer, and labor conditions improved significantly. In the very birthplace of this new coal mining method—the Third Section of the Fifth Pit—overproduction was achieved every month in the first half of this year, and in June, a new high-yield record for thin coal seams was created. The entire Ping'an Mine has won the first place in the Liaoning Province’s large-scale high-yield competition among nine coal mines for four consecutive quarters, due to the successful completion of all production targets.
          "Shaving Beards"
    In 1958, leading cadres of the Fuxin Coal Mine moved to the workers' residential areas to settle down and cultivate "experimental fields" deep in the front line of production. This style has been consistently maintained, and recently there have been new developments. Nearly three hundred cadres were transferred to strengthen the front line of production, and a group of mine directors, Party secretaries, and other leading cadres were sent down to the pitheads to serve concurrently as grassroots leaders. Not only do the leading cadres go deep into the field, but the rear leadership institutions also move entirely to the front line of production to work, so that problems are discovered quickly and resolved quickly.
    The Haizhou Open-pit Mine, which first implemented the "on-site office" system, raised the issue of "shaving beards." In the past, there were some relatively minor and specific problems in production. Cadres saw them but did not understand them deeply, so they were not resolved for a long time. The workers described these problems as "old problems that had grown beards." After the implementation of on-site offices, the situation changed. After Party Committee Deputy Secretary Yu Wenxue and Deputy Mine Director Wang Chuangao moved to the site to work, they saw the accident of the electric locomotive running the bow (the electric locomotive bow detaching from the wire) every day. Each accident required a three-to-five-minute stop. In the past, they did not pay much attention to such things. This time, they asked the dispatchers to calculate it and felt the problem was not small. The next day, they immediately had the engineering section form five shock teams to comprehensively overhaul the wiring, greatly reducing the incidence of running the bow accident. The electric locomotive drivers happily said, "This time, the cadres moved to the site to work, and even the problems that had grown beards were quickly resolved." The Municipal Party Committee and the Open-pit Mine Party Committee decided to universally "shave beards." They resolved such old problems in a solid, specific way, and have already achieved good results.
          Close Ties Between Cadres and the Masses
    Leading cadres going deep into the front line of production not only promptly discovered and resolved many key issues in production, but also grasped both production and life, further strengthening their relationship with the masses.
    A deputy mine director of the Ping'an Mine, after being sent down to the Fifth Pit to serve concurrently as the pit director, quickly resolved some problems in the lives of the workers. The non-staple food production at this pithead was doing well; a few days ago, they had just slaughtered two large fat pigs weighing two to three hundred pounds each. However, the workers had opinions about the cafeteria management: the variety of food was monotonous, they had to stand in line to buy food, and it was not hygienic. The deputy mine director ate with the workers in the pithead cafeteria and, hearing these reactions, immediately instructed a leading cadre of the pithead to take charge of the cafeteria work, absorb the opinions of the masses, replace the food administrator with someone everyone was satisfied with, implement a table-by-table food distribution system, and improve hygiene... The cafeteria changed completely in two days. Now everyone is satisfied with the food, and they have posted big-character posters to praise it. The workers have even more enthusiasm for production. The deputy mine director, who was originally in charge of electrical and mechanical equipment, is now paying attention to both production and life, effectively solving problems, and has closer ties with the masses.
    Once, Liu Xicheng, secretary of the Haizhou South Open-pit Mine Party Branch, and Li Shaoxian, chairman of the trade union, walked towards the deep pit. The midday sun was scorching the stones, and they saw that the workers were all wearing straw hats, there were cooling sheds everywhere, and the water buckets were filled with boiling water. They felt a sense of relief: "This year's heat prevention work is not a problem." Arriving at the deep pit, more than a thousand meters below the surface, they looked into the water bucket and were surprised to find it was empty. It turned out that the distance to the boiling water supply station was too far, and it was not easy to deliver the water, so sometimes the supply was insufficient. Without saying a word, the two went back and carried four full buckets of boiling water down, and decided that in the future, boiling water should be sent to the distant places first and then to the nearby places, to ensure that the deep pit could also have regular access to boiling water. The workers were very satisfied with the leading cadres' style of going deep to discover problems and solving them in a timely manner, and were determined to respond to the leaders' concern with high yields. That day, the small team's plan was to produce two hundred cars of coal, but they completed three hundred and four cars.
    Now, many leading cadres of the Fuxin Coal Mine have realized the benefits of going deep into the front line of production. They said: "In the past, problems came looking for the cadres. When there were many problems, there were many meetings. We were busy and passive in our work. Now, the cadres are looking for problems. The problems are solved accurately, decisively, and quickly. Many problems are solved at the outset. We are proactive in our work, production is rising, the cadres and the masses are united, and everyone from top to bottom is happy." (Attached picture)

    鲜花开在第一线
    本报记者　华旅　顾理
    一个初到阜新矿区的人，要想找到各级领导干部是不那么容易的，电话常常打不通，即使跑到他们的办公室去，也是“铁将军把门”。从中共阜新市委书记到每个坑口的领导干部，深入生产第一线已经形成一种风气。人们只有到群众中去，到生产现场去，才能比较容易地找到他们。他们扎扎实实领导生产的作风，已在这个矿区的生产建设上开出了朵朵“鲜花”，给我们留下了深刻的印象。
        从攉煤机到水力运输
    阜新煤矿是攉煤机的诞生地。当初我们以为，这里井下采煤工作面一定普遍使用攉煤机了。其实不然。在平安矿，就有80％的工作面已经不用攉煤机和运煤机，有一种更新的方法代替了它，这就是水力运输。在市委第一书记丘新野同志的“试验田”——平安矿五坑第三采煤段，我们参观了这种新采煤法。下到采煤工作面，只见几个工人已经打好眼、装上炸药。放过炮后，工人操纵一根水枪，就把崩松了的煤冲刷下来，顺着水槽哗哗地向下直泻。平常我们在采煤工作面上看到的攉煤、移运煤机、支柱、回柱等等复杂的工序，现在全看不见了。
    矿里同志告诉了我们这种新采煤法诞生的故事。有一个掘进工作面上部的旧巷道里存有积水，经常要放，水流过掘进工作面，便把煤粉都带跑。掘进工人想了一个办法，干脆“将计就计”，打眼放炮后就放水来冲煤，运煤效率比过去用运煤机提高80％。丘新野书记发现了这件事，立刻抓住了。当时，由于采掘效率提高，工作面运输是个薄弱环节。丘新野受到掘进工人的启发，决定在自己的“试验田”里试验水运。由于领导干部敏锐地发现新事物，坚决地加以支持，一种全新的采煤法形成了。平安二坑第六采煤段推广这种新采煤法以后，工作面设计、巷道布置等完全跳出旧法采煤的圈子，全面地进行了技术改造，平均日产量提高一倍以上；基本不用坑木，每吨煤的成本降低了82％；生产更加安全，劳动条件显著改善。就在我们参观的这种新采煤法的发祥地——五坑三段，今年上半年也是月月超产，6月份就创造了薄煤层高产新纪录。整个平安矿由于各项生产指标完成得好，已经连续四个季度获得辽宁省九个煤矿大面积高产竞赛的第一名。
          “刮胡子”
    阜新煤矿领导干部在1958年就搬家到工人住宅区落户，深入生产第一线种“试验田”。这种作风一直坚持下来，最近又有了新的发展。他们抽调了近三百名干部充实生产第一线，而且将一批矿长、党委书记等领导干部下放到坑口，兼任基层领导职务。不仅领导干部深入现场，而且后方领导机构也整套地搬到生产第一线去办公，做到发现问题快，解决问题也快。
    首先实行“现场办公”制度的海州露天矿，提出了“刮胡子”的问题。过去，生产中有一些比较小的具体问题，干部看到了但理解不深，长时间没有解决，工人们形容这些问题是“长了胡子的老问题”。实行现场办公以后，情况不同了。党委副书记于文学和副矿长王传诰搬到现场办公以后，每天都看到电机车跑弓子事故（电机车弓子与电线脱离），每次事故都得停车三、五分钟。以前，他们对这样的事是不大在意的，这次找调度人员来算了一下，感到问题不小，第二天立即让工务段组成五个突击队，全面检修了架线，使跑弓子事故大大减少。电机车司机高兴地说：“这回干部搬到现场办公，长了胡子的问题也很快解决了。”市委和露天矿党委决定要普遍“刮胡子”。他们把类似这样的老问题，扎扎实实地一个个地具体解决，现在已经收到良好效果。
          干部群众亲密无间
    领导干部深入生产第一线，不仅及时发现和解决了许多生产中的关键问题，而且既抓生产，又抓生活，更加密切了同群众的关系。
    平安矿有一位副矿长下放到五坑兼坑长以后，就迅速解决了职工生活方面的一些问题。这个坑口副食品生产搞得不错，前几天刚刚宰过两头两三百斤重的大肥猪。但是工人们对食堂管理有意见：饭菜花样单调，站队买饭，不卫生。副矿长在坑口食堂和工人一起吃饭，听到这些反应，立即责成坑口一位领导干部去抓食堂工作，吸收群众意见，换了一个大家满意的伙食管理员，实行按桌分饭菜制度，搞好卫生……。食堂两天变了个样，现在大家吃得满意，都贴出大字报表扬。工人们生产劲头更足。这位副矿长原来是专管机电的，现在注意生产、生活两手抓，切实解决问题，同群众关系更加亲密。
    有一次，海州南露天矿党总支书记刘喜成和工会主席李绍先往深部坑走去，中午的太阳晒得石头烫手，只见工人都戴着草帽，凉棚到处都有，水桶里装着开水，感到一种自慰：“今年防暑工作没啥问题了。”来到离地面一千多米的深部坑，往水桶里一看，没想到里面竟是空的。原来这里距离开水供应站太远，水不容易送到，有时候便供应不足。二话没说，两人就回去挑了满满四桶开水下来，并且决定今后开水先送远处，后送近处，保证深部坑也能经常喝到开水。工人们对领导干部这种深入发现问题，及时解决问题的作风很满意，决心以高产来回答领导的关心。当天那个小班的计划是出两百车煤，结果完成了三百零四车。
    现在，阜新煤矿的许多领导干部都已经认识到了深入生产第一线以后的好处。他们说：以前，问题找干部，问题多了，会议多，忙忙碌碌，工作被动；现在是干部找问题，问题解决得又准又狠又快，许多问题在发生之初就解决了，工作主动，生产上升，干部同群众打成一片，上上下下心情舒畅。（附图片）
