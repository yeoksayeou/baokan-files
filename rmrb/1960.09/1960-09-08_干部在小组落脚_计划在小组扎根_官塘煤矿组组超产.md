    Cadres Take Root in Teams, Plans Take Root in Teams
    Guantang Coal Mine Exceeds Production in Every Team

    (Our Dispatch) In the production increase and economy drive, the Guantang Coal Mine in Nanjing has achieved "cadres taking root in teams, plans taking root in teams." Leading cadres have gone deep underground to earnestly do team work. They distribute monthly, ten-day, and daily plans to the teams on time, and set up a model team at each wellhead to specifically help backward teams catch up with the advanced, making the labor competition in the whole mine a roaring success. Production in August saw a substantial increase. All six coal mining teams in the mine overfulfilled their monthly coal mining plans, and the entire mine overfulfilled its August plan by 27.8%.
  Beginning in early August, the mine's Party organization, based on its experience from January to July of this year, earnestly focused on team work. They mobilized the masses to discuss and then distributed monthly, ten-day, and daily production progress plans to each team and individual, so that the enterprise's plan took root in the work units and every worker had a clear understanding. On this basis, two pairs of production wells in the mine established model teams and organized the masses to carry out a competition of learning from, comparing with, catching up with, and helping each other. During the competition, the work sections conducted a daily evaluation, and the management departments promptly announced the completion of each shift's plan at the wellhead and work section, achieving "posting targets before the shift, monitoring progress during the shift, and summarizing and evaluating after the shift," so that the competition between shifts progressed wave upon wave. On the morning of August 20th, workers in Chen Yingtang's team in Mine No. 1, upon arriving at the wellhead, saw that their team only needed to mine eleven tons of coal to complete the monthly plan ahead of schedule, and immediately held a pre-shift meeting after going down the well. Everyone worked enthusiastically. With two hours left before the end of the shift, the work section managers went down the well again to inform them that they were only four tons away from completing the monthly plan, and the workers became even more motivated. By the end of the eight-hour shift, they had produced a total of 12.48 tons of coal, setting a new record. Subsequently, the advanced model team led by Zhang Kaiyu rose up and worked hard, producing 13.84 tons of coal in eight hours, also completing the monthly plan eleven days ahead of schedule.
    In grasping team work, leading cadres at all levels were assigned to go deep underground, participating in labor while helping teams improve their management and technical levels. Four mine-level leading cadres spent half a day every day working with the team workers underground, and the cadres of each work section were divided into three shifts, working day and night with the shifts. For example, Jia Zhanxiang's team in Mine No. 1 had not been completing their production tasks very well in the past. Deputy Mine Director Zhang Jian focused on this team while working underground, helping them find that the reason for the poor production was the improper allocation of labor, and that some young workers were not committed to underground coal mining work. He then helped the team leader reallocate labor and educated the young workers with the deeds of Chen Changben, a model worker committed to underground production. With Zhang Jian's help, the team's production increased steadily. On August 20th, in the competition to strive for early completion of the monthly plan, the team's output reached 14.32 tons, exceeding the model team led by Zhang Kaiyu. By August 21st, this team had also completed the monthly plan ten days ahead of schedule.
    In going deep into the work teams, leading cadres at all levels also continuously discovered and solved major key problems in production. For example, after production in the whole mine increased through competition, the underground transportation could not keep up with the demand. Mine leaders and cadres jointly studied solutions with the workers underground. Following a suggestion by worker Zheng Quanhai, the method of setting up small branch tracks for double-car transportation was adopted, which solved the underground transportation problem, improved work efficiency by more than 50%, and saved a large number of small rails.

    干部在小组落脚　计划在小组扎根
    官塘煤矿组组超产
    本报讯　南京官塘煤矿在增产节约运动中，做到了“干部在小组落脚、计划在小组扎根”。领导干部深入井下认真做好小组工作。他们将月、旬、日计划按时下达给小组，并在每个井口树立一个标兵小组，具体帮助后进小组奋赶先进，使全矿劳动竞赛搞得轰轰烈烈，8月份生产获得了大幅度增长。全矿六个采煤小组个个都超额完成了采煤月计划，全矿也超额27.8％完成了8月份计划。
  这个矿的党组织从8月初开始，就根据今年1到7月份的经验，认真抓好小组工作。他们把月计划、旬计划以及每天生产进度，通过发动群众讨论，全部下达到小组和个人，使企业的计划在班组扎根，使工人个个心中有数。在这个基础上，全矿两对生产井都树立了标兵小组，组织群众开展学、比、赶、帮的竞赛。竞赛中，工段每天一评比，管理部门按时在井口和工段公布每一班的计划完成情况，做到“班前挂牌作战，班中看苗促进，班后总结评比”，使班组间的竞赛始终一浪高一浪地向前发展。8月20日上午，一号井陈应堂班工人一上班，就在井口看到自己班只要再挖十一吨多煤就可提前完成月计划，下井后立即举行了班前会。大家干得热火朝天。到临下班还有两小时的时候，工段管理人员又下井向他们公布还差四吨多就可完成月计划的情况，工人们劲头更足。等到一班八小时干完，共计产煤十二点四八吨，创造了先进纪录。接着，先进标兵班张开羽班奋起直追，八小时产煤十三点八四吨，也提前十一天完成了月计划。
    在抓小组工作中，各级领导干部都分工深入井下，一边参加劳动，一边帮助小组提高管理水平和技术水平。全矿四个矿级领导干部每天有半天时间在井下，和班组工人一起劳动，各工段的干部则分为三班，日夜跟班劳动。如一号井贾占祥班，过去生产任务完成得不够好，副矿长张健在井下劳动时，就重点抓这个班，帮助他们找到了生产差的原因是劳动力分配不够恰当，有的青年工人不安心井下采煤工作。他便帮助班长重新调配劳动力，并以安心井下生产的标兵陈昌本的事迹教育青年工人。经过张健的帮助，这个班的生产节节上升。8月20日那天，全班工人在力争提前完成月计划的竞赛中，班产量达到了十四点三二吨，超过了标兵班张开羽班。这个班到8月21日，也提前十天完成了月计划。
    各级领导干部在深入班组中，还不断发现和解决生产中的重大关键问题。如全矿通过竞赛生产上升以后，井下运输跟不上需要。矿领导干部在井下和工人共同研究解决办法，经过工人郑全海建议，采用架设小叉道的办法搞双车运输，既解决了井下运输问题，提高工效50％以上，又节约了大批小铁轨。
