Changchun, September 17th (from our newspaper) – Huadian County, Jilin Province, rich in resources, adhering to the principle of taking grain and beans as the key link and comprehensively developing diversified operations, while carrying out the agricultural super-production contract movement, is seizing the favorable opportunity of the mass maturation of various wild plants. They are organizing a sufficient labor force to go to high mountains, enter dense forests, go to barren gullies, and enter grasslands to carry out the "small autumn harvest" movement and vigorously collect various wild plants. According to statistics, in August alone, the county collected more than two million catties of various wild plants and also processed 260,000 catties of various finished products using wild plants. The communes received a total of 1.17 million yuan in cash, with an average income of more than ten yuan per agricultural person.

This year, in order to further clarify the county's wild plant resources, grasp the most favorable collection time for various wild plants, so as to properly arrange the labor force and effectively organize the collection, the Huadian County Party Committee drew more than 30 cadres from industrial, agricultural, commercial, medical, and transportation departments at the beginning of July, and cooperated with more than 100 experienced commune members to form a survey army to conduct a general survey. In nearly a month, they traveled all over the county's 1.09 million hectares of mountains, hills, and barren grasslands, and found more than 300 kinds of wild fibers, oilseeds, wine materials, papermaking raw materials, chemical raw materials, Chinese medicinal materials, and various wild feeds, including more than 20 newly discovered wild plants with collection value. After finding out the most favorable collection time for various wild plants based on the detailed materials obtained from the survey, the County Party Committee made specific studies, arrangements, and deployments for agricultural and sideline production activities after autumn, on the premise of ensuring grain production. According to the instructions of the County Party Committee, the communes made overall plans for post-autumn farmland management, wild plant collection, and fertilizer accumulation and manufacturing. Dividing into three fronts with late-stage field management as the main focus, and according to the needs of production tasks on each front, the lightness or heaviness of work, and the level of technology, they adopted the three-tier arrangement of male and female labor, auxiliary labor for the elderly and weak, and family members of employees, and implemented rational arrangements based on the principle of making the best use of talents and effectively using labor, and established specialized teams. At the same time, according to the length of time of various productions and the characteristics of the variability of production work, to ensure mutual support between the fronts and not to miss favorable opportunities, reserve shock brigades were also formed in the labor force on each front.

After entering August, when various wild plants began to mature in large quantities, a "small autumn harvest" movement, which was more powerful and wider in scope than in previous years, was generally launched throughout the county. The county organized expedition teams accounting for 11.3% of the total labor force, and transferred a large number of livestock and transportation tools to set up camps in high mountains and deep valleys and dense forests to vigorously collect. In order not to miss a moment and not to miss a single variety, to ensure that all kinds of wild raw materials are transported down the mountain completely, the county also tapped labor potential in a big way, organized a collection team of 2,000 people composed of auxiliary labor, family members of industrial and mining workers, etc., and launched a mass mobilization campaign to vigorously collect. Many commune members who participated in field management, grazing, and logistics work also collected wild raw materials in conjunction with their work. According to statistics, the county's collection volume in August this year increased by 10% compared to the same period last year. According to the characteristics of the large number and wide distribution of wild plant varieties, the communes implemented a production remuneration system including contracted value plans, designated variety projects, labor, tasks, time, and over-quota rewards, and implemented various wild plants to groups and individuals according to variety and task. In this way, it can be done to flexibly implement centralized or decentralized production according to the characteristics of the dispersion degree and yield size of various wild plants, and overcome the phenomena of emphasizing large and neglecting small, emphasizing more and neglecting less in collection. According to the survey statistics of the purchasing department, more than 70 kinds of wild raw materials were collected this year compared to the same period last year.

According to the inconvenient transportation in mountainous areas and the difficulty in transportation in the current rainy season, the Huadian County Party Committee paid great attention to strengthening the leadership of processing, purchasing and transportation work while organizing the masses to vigorously collect. In terms of processing, factories are run at three levels: county, commune, and management area. More than 130 various types of small and medium-sized processing factories have been built in various towns, mountain villages, and collection points.

With the extensive development of collection and processing, commercial and transportation departments are actively carrying out purchasing and large-scale transportation, mobilizing the enthusiasm of the masses for production.

    以粮为纲全面安排劳力　抓紧时机突击采集
    桦甸各种野生原料源源下山
    八月份采集量比去年同期增加，每人收入十多元
    本报长春17日电　资源丰富的吉林桦甸县，本着以粮、豆为纲，全面发展多种经营的方针，在开展农业超包产运动的同时，抓紧各种野生植物大量成熟的有利时机，组织足够的人力，上高山，入密林，赴荒沟，进草场，开展“小秋收”运动，突击采集各种野生植物。据统计，8月份全县就采集各种野生植物达二百多万斤，还利用野生植物加工出各种成品二十六万斤。各公社共收入现金一百一十七万元，按农业人口平均计算，每人收入十多元。
    今年，中共桦甸县委为了进一步查清全县的野生植物资源，掌握各种野生植物的最有利的采集时机，以便妥善安排劳力，有效地组织采集，于7月初从工业、农业、商业、医药和运输部门抽调三十多名干部，配合各公社一百多名有经验的社员，组成了勘察大军进行普查。他们在将近一个月的时间内，踏遍了全县一百零九万公顷山林丘陵和荒洼草场，共查出野生纤维、油料、酒料、造纸原料、化工原料、中药材和各种野生饲料等三百多种，其中新发现二十多种有采集价值的野生植物。县委根据普查到的详细材料，找出各种野生植物的最有利的采集时机后，在确保粮食生产的原则下，对秋后的农副业生产活动都作了具体研究、安排和部署。各公社根据县委的指示，对秋后的农田管理、野生植物采集和积肥造肥等生产活动进行了全面规划。以后期田间管理为主划分三条战线，根据各线生产任务需要、活计轻重、技术高低，采取男女劳力、老弱辅助劳力、职工家属等进行三排队，本着人尽其才、有效使用劳力的原则实行合理安排，建立专业队伍。同时，根据各项生产的时间长短，生产活计多变的特点，保证各线互相支援，不错过有利时机，又在各条战线劳力中组成了后备突击队。
    进入8月后，当各种野生植物开始大量成熟的时候，一个比往年声势更大、规模更广的“小秋收”运动，在全县各地普遍展开。全县组织了占总劳力11.3％的远征队，抽调大批畜力和运输工具，在高山大谷和密林深处安营扎寨，突击采集。为了不错过一刻时机，不漏掉一个品种，保证各种野生原料宗宗下山，样样不丢，全县还大挖劳动潜力，组织二千名由辅助劳力、工矿职工家属等组成的采集队伍，并开展全民动手的突击采集运动。许多公社参加田间管理、放牧和后勤等工作的人员都结合自己的工作采集野生原料。据统计，今年全县8月份的采集量比去年同时期增加10％。各公社根据野生植物品种多、分布广的特点，实行了以包产值计划、定品种项目、劳力、任务、时间、超额奖励等生产报酬制度，将各种野生植物按品种按任务落实到组、到人。这样就做到根据各种野生植物分散程度和产量大小等特点，灵活地实行集中或分散生产，克服了采集中的重大轻小、重多轻少等现象。据收购部门的调查统计，今年收的野生原料比去年同时期增加七十多种。
    中共桦甸县委根据山区交通不便和当前多雨季节运输困难等情况，在组织群众突击采集的同时，非常注意加强对加工、收购和运输工作的领导。在加工方面，从县到公社、管理区三级办厂，已在各个城镇、山村和采集点上建起各种类型的中小型加工厂一百三十多个。
    商业、运输部门随着采集、加工的广泛开展，积极开展收购和大搞调运，调动群众的生产积极性。
