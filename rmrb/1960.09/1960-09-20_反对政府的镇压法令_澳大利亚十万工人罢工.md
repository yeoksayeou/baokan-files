    Xinhua News Agency, Sydney, 16th: A major strike involving 100,000 workers erupted on September 14th in Queensland, Australia's second-largest state. The striking workers are demanding that the state government revoke the "state of emergency" declared to suppress worker strikes.

    Seven weeks ago, workers at the Commonwealth Engineering Company in the state went on strike demanding a 28% wage increase. The state government, fearing that the striking workers' victory would decisively break the wage freeze, declared a "state of emergency." Approximately thirty trade unions participated in the September 14th strike. They announced their full support for the strikers and firmly opposed the government's declared "state of emergency," warning the government that actions taken under the "emergency regulations" would provoke further action by the workers.

    反对政府的镇压法令
    澳大利亚十万工人罢工
    新华社16日讯　悉尼消息：澳大利亚第二大州—昆士兰州，14日爆发了有十万名工人参加的大罢工。罢工工人要求州政府取消为了镇压工人罢工而宣布的“紧急状态”。
    七个星期以前，这个州的联邦机器制造公司的工人，要求公司提高工资28％而举行了罢工，州政府唯恐罢工工人取得胜利会决定性地打破对工资的冻结，便宣布了“紧急状态”。大约有三十个工会参加了14日的罢工。它们宣布完全支持罢工者，并断然反对政府宣布的“紧急状态”，他们警告政府说，政府根据“紧急条例”采取的行动将引起工人采取更进一步的行动。
