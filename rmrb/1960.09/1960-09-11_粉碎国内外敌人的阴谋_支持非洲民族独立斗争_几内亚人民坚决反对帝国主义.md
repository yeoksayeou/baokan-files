Xinhua News Agency, 10th Dispatch: Our correspondent reports: Since its independence, the Republic of Guinea has resolutely opposed imperialism and colonialism, safeguarded national independence, and actively supported African countries in their struggle to win and maintain national independence.

    In the past two years, the Guinean government and people have exposed and suppressed a number of counter-revolutionary subversion cases instigated by imperialist countries, and carried out a series of reforms in the political sphere to eliminate colonial influences. These measures have struck a blow to the arrogance of imperialism and defended the young republic.

    As everyone now knows, from the day Guinea declared its independence, French imperialism has been gnashing its teeth, trying to strangle this country. It has not only exerted various pressures in the economic and financial spheres, but has also hired a large number of spies to infiltrate Guinea and carry out despicable subversive activities. However, the imperialists did not expect that the people of this country, who "would rather be poor and free than rich and enslaved" (Sékou Touré), after a long period of anti-colonialist struggle, have been able to see through and thwart their conspiracies. It should be noted that the Guinean people, disregarding all threats, opposed de Gaulle's "constitution" with an overwhelming majority of 95.4% and chose the path of independence, which is the result of a long-term struggle against imperialism. Before this, the broad masses of peasants had repeatedly launched uprisings against the colonizers. It should also be pointed out that at the time of Guinea's independence, the Democratic Party of Guinea, led by President Touré, had already established more than 4,000 branches throughout the country and called on the masses to participate in the struggle against colonialism.

    Shortly after independence, in May 1959, the Political Bureau of the Democratic Party of Guinea (the ruling party) exposed the conspiracy of imperialism in a report, pointing out that Guinea's enemies were "becoming increasingly angry" with Guinea's achievements, and called on all levels of the Democratic Party to be vigilant and called on the people to rise up against the conspiracies of imperialism.

    Under the leadership of the government, the Guinean people cracked a conspiracy case in December of that year. Then, in April and May of this year, in just over half a month, they successively cracked two more sinister espionage activities. According to reports, the spy network established by imperialism set up radio transmitters and receivers in various parts of Guinea, transported in weapons and ammunition, and attempted to recruit 5,000 people in Guinea, which has a population of only 2.5 million, to engage in subversive activities, plotting to assassinate President Sékou Touré, incite armed rebellion, and overthrow this young republic.

    The Guinean government took resolute measures to combat this conspiracy instigated by imperialism. It arrested and severely punished the heads and some members of the spy organization, and sentenced eleven of them to death (eight others were sentenced to death in absentia); and exhibited the weapons and ammunition supplied by the United States, France, West Germany and other imperialist countries to the subversives. Among them, there were twenty-one boxes of American-made grenades and incendiary bombs, revealing the fact that American imperialism also participated in this conspiracy.

    The imperialist conspiracy aroused great anger among the people of Guinea. The Guinean News Agency published an editorial on this, saying: This "makes it easy for all of us to understand that in the life of a country, there are times when generous practices may jeopardize years of struggle, undo previous achievements, and dash hopes." It correctly concluded that "the revolution cannot only be half-done. Counter-revolution, subversion, corruption and extortion must be ruthlessly crushed with the same strength and energy with which we seized power."

    After cracking these conspiracy cases, the Guinean government passed a resolution to punish traitors and established a "Vigilance Committee."

    In order to safeguard national independence and sovereignty, in the past two years, the Democratic Party of Guinea and the government have successively promulgated a number of decisions to eliminate the political influence of colonialism. For example, it stipulates that foreign lawyers may no longer practice in Guinea unless they obtain Guinean nationality; cancel the names of military camps named after foreigners and prohibit the wearing of foreign military medals. It is especially worth mentioning that the Guinean government has driven out all colonial officials in the military and administrative departments. Now, only Africans themselves serve in the Guinean army and government, and no longer can the colonial officials who once enslaved them be found. This action completely shattered the slander spread by the imperialists that "Africans cannot manage their own countries," and greatly encouraged the enthusiasm and confidence of the African people in their anti-colonialist struggle. Therefore, it has had a positive impact in African countries, especially in the West African countries that were formerly French colonies.

    In the past two years, Guinea, a country with a small population but resolute in opposing imperialism and colonialism, while thwarting the conspiracies of enemies at home and abroad, has also actively supported the struggle of African countries to win and maintain national independence. Representatives of the Guinean government and people participated in the All-African People's Conference, warmly received the representatives of various countries participating in the Second Asian-African People's Solidarity Conference in Conakry, and actively participated in the conference activities and made contributions.

    The Guinean government and people have clearly expressed their support for the heroic struggle of the Algerian people against colonialism. At the Second All-African People's Conference held in January this year, the Guinean representative, Minister of Public Works Ismail Touré, sternly condemned the United Nations resolution on the Algerian issue, saying: "It is unimaginable to pretend to defend peace and stand idly by the tragedy of Algeria. The struggle to maintain peace in the true sense of the word cannot ignore support for the cause of the Algerian people."

    Another Guinean representative, Minister Resident in Ghana, Diallo, sharply exposed the insidious two-faced tactics of imperialism at this conference. He said: "The imperialists find that they cannot stop the course of history and change the African people's determination for independence, so they try every means to try to get the people to give up the struggle. They are prepared to nominally agree to 'independence,' but at the same time maintain their economic control." He pointed out that "all African people must fight against this dangerous practice and proposition of colonialism."

    Guinean national leaders call this two-faced tactic of imperialism "neo-colonialism." President Sékou Touré pointed out in his opening speech at the Second Asian-African People's Solidarity Conference: "The ultimate goal of neo-colonialism is to continue to keep our people in a subordinate state under the guise of the 'independence' of African countries"; "We must be vigilant against the divisive and distracting tactics of imperialism."

    Recently, the Guinean government and people have not only expressed great concern about the development of the situation in the Congo, but also actively supported the Congo's struggle to safeguard national independence and unity.

    President Sékou Touré issued a letter to all independent African countries on the Congo situation, calling on "African countries must take strong joint action to ensure the independence of the Congo, which is threatened by imperialist aggression." On July 17, a rally attended by more than 10,000 people was held in Conakry, the capital of Guinea, to support the Congolese people's struggle against colonialism and to defend national independence. And passed a resolution, pointing out that the war in the Congo is "actually supported by all imperialist countries. This shows that the imperialist countries have decided to monopolize the resources of the African continent as before." President Sékou Touré and the Guinean radio station have repeatedly condemned the United Nations for interfering in the internal affairs of the Congo.

    It is precisely because of Guinea's position of actively supporting the struggle of African countries to win and maintain independence that it has been respected and supported by the people of the world, and its influence in Africa has also been expanding.

    粉碎国内外敌人的阴谋　支持非洲民族独立斗争
    几内亚人民坚决反对帝国主义
    新华社10日讯　本社记者报道：几内亚共和国在独立后坚决反对帝国主义、殖民主义，维护民族独立，并积极支持非洲国家争取和维护民族独立的斗争。
    两年来，几内亚政府和人民揭露并镇压了多起由帝国主义国家策动的反革命颠复案件，在政治上进行了一系列清除殖民主义影响的改革。这些措施，打击了帝国主义的气焰，保卫了年青的共和国。
    正如大家现在所知道的那样，从几内亚宣布独立那一天起，法帝国主义就一直咬牙切齿地想扼杀这个国家。它不仅在经济、财政上施加了种种压力，还雇用大批间谍渗入几内亚，进行卑鄙的颠复活动。但是帝国主义者没有想到，这个“宁愿穷而自由，也不愿富裕而受人奴役”（塞古·杜尔语）的国家的人民，经过长期反殖民主义斗争的锻炼，已能识破并粉碎它们的阴谋诡计。应当看到：几内亚人民不顾种种威胁，以95.4％的绝大多数票反对戴高乐“宪法”，选择了独立的道路，是长期以来对帝国主义进行斗争的结果。在这以前，广大的农民曾经一次又一次地掀起了反抗殖民者的起义。还应当指出的是：在几内亚独立的当时，由杜尔总统领导的几内亚民主党已经在全国建立了四千多个支部，并且号召群众参加反对殖民主义的斗争。
    独立后不久，1959年5月，几内亚民主党（执政党）政治局就曾在一份报告中揭露了帝国主义的阴谋，指出几内亚的敌人随着几内亚的成就“变得越来越加愤怒”，号召民主党的各级组织提高警惕性，号召人民起来反对帝国主义的阴谋。
    几内亚人民在政府领导下，于当年的12月就破获了一起阴谋案。接着，在今年4、5月间不过半个多月的时间内，又接连破获了两起更为阴险的间谍活动。据宣布，由帝国主义建立的间谍网在几内亚各地设置了无线电发报机和收报机，运进了武器和弹药，并且企图在只有二百五十万人口的几内亚搜罗五千名专门从事颠复活动的分子，图谋杀害塞古·杜尔总统，煽起武装叛乱，推翻这个年青的共和国。
    几内亚政府对帝国主义策动的这种阴谋采取了坚决打击的措施。它逮捕并严惩了间谍组织的负责人和一部分成员，并判决其中十一人死刑（另有八人缺席判决死刑）；并且，展出了由美、法、西德等帝国主义供给颠复分子的武器弹药。其中，有二十一箱美国制造的手榴弹和燃烧弹，揭露了美帝国主义也参与了这一阴谋的事实。
    帝国主义的阴谋激起了几内亚全国人民的极大愤怒。几内亚新闻社就此发表社论说：这“使我们大家很容易懂得：在一个国家的生活中，有着这样的时刻、宽大的做法可能使多年的斗争受到危害，使前功尽弃，使希望落空”。它正确地得出结论说：“革命不能只进行一半。必须用同我们夺取政权一样的力量和精力来毫不留情地粉碎反革命、颠复活动、腐蚀和讹诈。”
    在破获这些阴谋案之后，几内亚政府通过了一项惩治卖国贼的决议，并且成立了“警惕委员会”。
    为了维护国家独立和主权，在过去的两年中，几内亚民主党和政府还陆续颁布了一些肃清殖民主义政治影响的决定。例如，它规定外国律师除非取得几内亚国籍，否则不得再在几内亚开业；取消以外国人命名的军营名称、禁止佩带外国军事勋章。尤其值得一提的是：几内亚政府在军事和行政部门中赶走了所有的殖民主义官吏。现在，在几内亚的军队和政府中服务的完全是非洲人自己，再也找不到昔日奴役他们的殖民官吏了。这一行动，彻底粉碎了帝国主义者散播的“非洲人管不了自己国家”的谰言，大大鼓舞了非洲人民反殖民主义斗争的热情和信心。因此，在非洲国家，特别是在那些前法属殖民地的西非国家中，起了积极的影响。
    过去两年中，人口虽少但是反对帝国主义、殖民主义坚决的几内亚在粉碎国内外敌人的阴谋的同时，还积极地支持了非洲国家争取和维护民族独立的斗争。几内亚政府和人民的代表参加了全非人民大会，热情地在科纳克里接待了参加第二届亚非人民团结大会的各国代表，并积极参加大会活动，作出了贡献。
    几内亚政府和人民明确地表示支持阿尔及利亚人民反对殖民主义的英勇斗争。在今年1月间召开的第二届全非人民大会上，几内亚代表、公共工程部长伊斯梅尔·杜尔在严正斥责联合国会议关于阿尔及利亚问题的决议时曾经说过：“伪称保卫和平而对阿尔及利亚的悲剧袖手旁观，这是令人不能想像的事。名副其实的维护和平的斗争不能忽视对阿尔及利亚人民的事业的支持。”
    另一位几内亚代表、常驻加纳部长迪亚洛在这次大会上尖锐地揭露了帝国主义阴险的两面手法。他说：“帝国主义者发现自己不能制止历史的进程和改变非洲人民独立的决心，因此想尽办法企图使人民放弃斗争。他们准备在名义上同意‘独立’，但同时保持他们的经济控制。”他指出，“全体非洲人民必须同殖民主义的这种危险的做法和主张进行斗争”。
    几内亚国家领导人把帝国主义的这种两面手法称作“新殖民主义”。塞古·杜尔总统在第二届亚非人民团结大会上致开幕词时就指出：“新殖民主义的最终目的在于以非洲国家‘独立’为幌子继续使我们人民处于从属状态”；“必须警惕帝国主义的分裂和分散注意力的手段”。
    最近一个时期以来，几内亚政府和人民对刚果局势的发展不仅表示了极大的关心，而且积极地支持了刚果维护国家独立和统一的斗争。
    塞古·杜尔总统曾就刚果局势发表致所有非洲独立国家书，呼吁“非洲各国必须采取强有力的联合行动，以保证由于帝国主义侵略而遭到威胁的刚果的独立”。7月17日，在几内亚首都科纳克里召开了有一万多人参加的大会，支持刚果人民反对殖民主义和保卫民族独立的斗争。并且通过决议，指出在刚果发生的这场战争“实际上受到一切帝国主义国家的支持。这表明，帝国主义各国决定像以前一样垄断非洲大陆的资源”。塞古·杜尔总统和几内亚电台还为此一再谴责了联合国干涉刚果内政。
    正是由于几内亚这种积极支持非洲国家争取和维护独立的斗争的立场，它受到全世界人民的尊重和支持，它在非洲的影响也日益扩大。
