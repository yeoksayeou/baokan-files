Hu Zhiming (Ho Chi Minh) Chairman sent his cultural envoy -- the Vietnam Classical Opera Troupe to Beijing audiences to send pearl-like artistic gifts and rare aesthetic enjoyment.

After the curtain was raised, the dim Southern new moon shone through the leaves of tropical plants on the hard-working and simple farmer, Brother San. Brother San was resting in bed after working for a day. He had a dream that the Dragon King sent him a shining bottle of holy water. When he woke up, the bottle was indeed on the bedside. When he opened the bottle, he could hear the sound of Sheng and flute. He thought that if he and his wife drank the holy water, they would be able to live forever. He casually hung the bottle on a tree and went to the field with his hoe.

Sister-in-law San woke up sleepily, not seeing her husband but discovering the bottle. She put her hand in it, and it was cool inside. When she pulled it out, her originally rough and black hands became snow-white and delicate. She was extremely happy and simply used this water to wash her hair and bathe. Not only did the green onions watered by the holy water grow particularly big and fat, but it also turned Sister-in-law San into an unparalleled beauty, so much so that her husband didn't recognize her when he came back.

This change in Sister-in-law San's appearance made Brother San infatuated, but unexpected misfortune also followed. Brother San drew a picture of his wife, and this picture was taken by a crow who had been hurt by Brother San for stealing corn and dropped it into the palace. The emperor sent someone to threaten to massacre the entire village to kidnap Sister-in-law San into the palace to make her the Western Empress. But Sister-in-law San didn't speak or smile. She was mute. The emperor ordered many famous doctors to treat her, but it was ineffective. She also disdained delicacies. The palace maids discovered that this empress loved to drink scallion soup. The emperor ordered the imperial chefs to prepare more scallions, and on the advice of his ministers, he gathered famous clowns into the palace to perform plays, hoping to win a smile from the beauty. But Sister-in-law San was still full of sorrow. One day, Brother San came to the capital to sell scallions. His cries reached Sister-in-law San's ears, which made her pleasantly surprised. The sorrow that had enveloped her beautiful face for months suddenly disappeared. The emperor was very surprised and immediately called the scallion seller, wanting to exchange clothes with him. The emperor, dressed in farmer's clothes, carried scallions and sold them, hoping to win the beauty's favor. But Brother San, dressed in a dragon robe, embraced Sister-in-law San with great joy. The emperor did not allow it. Brother San ordered the emperor to be beheaded. The guards had long hated this brutal and lewd emperor and indeed raised their spears and stabbed him to death, and established Brother San as the new king. This is the story of "The Bottle of Holy Water".

This beautiful story, through the actors' wonderful performances, the moving Southern music and singing, the simple and beautiful set, and the costumes full of Southern characteristics, also reminds people of ancient Eastern culture, constituting an unforgettable, wonderful and warm stage scene.

The Vietnamese actresses all have a lingering and sweet voice. Comrade Chen Cuilan, who played Sister-in-law San, sang a lyrical solo when she was robbed into the palace and missed her husband. It was truly delightful. The Vietnamese actors pay great attention to the performance of their hands. They use a lot of wrist and palm movements, with beautiful and delicate lines. This shows that the art of classical opera has many valuable traditions. During the French imperialist occupation, Vietnamese national drama suffered greatly, and its excellent traditions were on the verge of extinction. It has been restored and innovated to this extent in the past ten years since the revolution. This is truly a victory for the Vietnamese Party's literary and art policy!

"Chao Ju" (嘲剧) is a transliteration, but it also has meaning. It is a genre of comedic drama based on humor and satire, praising revolution and progress while ridiculing and criticizing reaction and backwardness. Therefore, the main actors are often clowns. The role of the emperor in "The Bottle of Holy Water" is a bit like the "clown" in Cantonese opera. But it seems that the roles of "sheng" (male) and "dan" (female) are also very important, because they also portray historical and contemporary positive characters and heroes.

After enjoying an artistic experience, I would like to write a few words to express my sincere gratitude and wish them success in their performances in China! (Attached picture)

    越南嘲剧给了我们美的享受
    田汉
    胡志明主席派遣了他的文化使节——越南嘲剧团给北京观众送来珍珠般的艺术礼品和稀有的美的享受。
    绒幕启后，昏黄的南国新月透过热带植物的叶子照着勤劳纯朴的农民三哥。三哥劳动了一天正躺在床上休息，他作了一个梦，龙王给他送来一个发亮的神水瓶，醒后果然瓶子还在床头，打开瓶塞可以听到笙笛的声音。他想他们夫妇喝了神水一定可以长生不老。他随手把瓶子挂在树上，就背起锄头种地去了。
    三嫂睡眼惺忪地起来了，不见她丈夫却发
  现了瓶子，用手插进去，里面冰凉的。抽出来一看，原来又粗又黑的手变得雪白粉嫩。她高兴极了，索性用这水洗头、洗澡，不只神水泼过的青葱长得特别肥大，而且使三嫂变成了绝世美人，以致她丈夫回来都不认识她了。
     三嫂这一形体的变化，虽则使三哥迷醉，但意外的不幸也随之而来。三哥为他妻子画了一张相，这相给因偷食玉米被三哥打伤了的乌鸦衔去投到皇宫里。皇帝派人以屠杀全村相威胁把三嫂劫进宫里，要立她为西后。但三嫂不说话也不笑。她哑了。皇帝多方命名医医治无效。山珍海味她也不屑一顾。宫女发现这位娘娘却爱喝葱汤。皇帝命令御厨多备好葱，又从大臣建议集名丑入宫演戏，想博美人一笑，无奈三嫂依然是愁容满面。一天三哥到京城卖葱，他的叫卖声传到三嫂的耳里，不觉使她惊喜，几个月来笼罩她玉容的愁云忽然扫去了。皇帝十分奇怪，立刻把卖葱的叫来，要跟他换衣服。穿上农民服装的皇帝担起青葱叫卖，以冀赢得美人的欢心。但穿上龙袍的三哥却与三嫂大喜相抱。皇帝不许，三哥下令把皇帝砍了，侍卫们平日早已痛恨这残暴荒淫的皇帝，果然举起戈戟刺死了他，而立三哥为新王。——这就是《神水瓶》的故事。
    这美丽故事通过演员们精彩表演，荡气回肠的南方音乐和歌唱，朴素美观的装置，富有南国特色，也使人想起古代东方文化的服装，就构成使人难忘的奇妙温暖的舞台情境。
    越南女演员们都有一种缠绵甜美的歌喉，演三嫂的陈翠兰同志在被抢入皇宫后望月思夫的一段抒情独唱，真是使人欢喜。越南演员们很讲究手的表演，他们运用手腕和手掌的舞姿极多，线条妙丽、细腻，这说明嘲剧艺术有许多可贵的传统。在法帝占领期间，越南民族戏剧饱经摧残，优秀传统不绝如缕，革命后十多年来已经恢复和革新到这个程度，真是越南党的文艺政策的胜利！
    嘲剧是译音，但也有意义。它是以诙谐讽刺为主的风俗喜剧，歌颂革命进步而嘲笑抨击反动落后。因此主要演员常常是丑角，拿“神水瓶”的皇帝一角说有点像粤剧的“丑生”。但看来生旦各角也很重要，因为它们也塑造历史上和当代的正面人物、英雄人物。
    在一种艺术享受之后先写这么几句表示衷心感谢，祝他们在中国演出的成功！（附图片）
