Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, September 4th: Nearly ten thousand commercial personnel dispatched by the People's Communes in the suburbs of Shanghai have gone to production teams to open comprehensive stores. These stores not only supply materials but also purchase products and organize the economic life of the commune members, actively serving the forefront of production. Currently, there are more than 1,500 such comprehensive stores in the city. Shanghai, Chuansha, Pudong, Nanhui, and other counties have basically achieved the goal of having a store in every production team.

The establishment of comprehensive stores in production teams is a new measure taken by the commercial departments in the suburbs of Shanghai under the current new situation to more effectively promote agricultural production. The comprehensive store is under the dual leadership of the commune supply and marketing cooperative and the production team. On the one hand, it is an agency dispatched by the commune supply and marketing cooperative, and its business is under the unified leadership of the supply and marketing cooperative. It implements the unified purchase and sales plan formulated by the supply and marketing cooperative and implements the state's price policy; at the same time, it reports the implementation and the needs of the production team to the supply and marketing cooperative at any time. This makes it easier for the supply and marketing cooperative to arrange work in a unified manner. On the other hand, the comprehensive store carries out its work under the direct leadership of the production team's Party branch, and the production team's Party branch also includes the work of the comprehensive store in its agenda. Therefore, the various activities of the comprehensive store are more closely coordinated with agricultural production. The store clerks not only do business but also participate in the team's activities and live and work alongside the farmers to gain an in-depth understanding of their needs in all aspects and carry out their work.

These comprehensive stores display the means of production and daily necessities needed by the farmers, from sickles, hoes, veterinary medicine and equipment, towels, socks, to needles and thread, generally two to three hundred kinds of commodities. For large machinery, farm implements, and other commodities, the store does not stock them, but if customers need them, they can also purchase them on their behalf. In this way, farmers do not have to go to the market town to buy general merchandise. The Baoxin Production Team of the Huacao Commune in Shanghai County urgently needed materials such as lead wire, nails, and hemp rope in the recent fight against typhoons. They told the store in the team, and although the store was out of stock at the time, the salesperson went to town to purchase them overnight and delivered them to the door early the next morning.

The comprehensive stores also adopt various methods to facilitate farmers in carrying out the purchase of agricultural and sideline products, local specialties, and waste products. In addition to purchasing at the store and entrusting the canteen to purchase on their behalf, the salesperson also goes door-to-door with daily necessities, supplying and purchasing at the same time. As a result, many small and scattered products are quickly purchased.

In terms of acting as an assistant to the production team's Party branch in organizing the economic life of the commune members, each comprehensive store has personnel specifically responsible. They help the production team's public canteen to grow vegetables, raise pigs, and use and manage the grain well. With the help of the comprehensive store, many production teams have established living service organizations such as barbershops, bathhouses, and commodity repair shops.

Since the beginning of this year, the commercial departments of various counties and communes in the suburbs of Shanghai have vigorously carried out technological innovations and rationally adjusted labor organization, which has greatly improved work efficiency. Therefore, it is possible to transfer some personnel to production teams to open comprehensive stores, strengthening service to the forefront of production while doing a good job in urban commercial work.

### 到生产队去办综合商店  上海郊区万名商业人员深入农业第一线

    到生产队去办综合商店
    上海郊区万名商业人员深入农业第一线
    据新华社上海4日电　上海郊区各县人民公社派出近万名商业人员，到生产队开设综合商店。综合商店既供应物资，又收购产品，还组织社员经济生活，积极为生产第一线服务。目前，全市已有一千五百多家这样的综合商店。上海、川沙、浦东、南汇等县基本上做到队队有商店。
    在生产队建立综合商店，是上海郊区商业部门在当前新形势下，为了更有力地促进农业生产采取的一项新措施。综合商店是由公社供销部和生产队双重领导的。它一方面是公社供销部的派出机构，在业务上由供销部统一领导。它执行供销部制订的统一的购销计划，贯彻国家价格政策；同时随时把执行情况和生产队的需要向供销部汇报。这样就更加便于供销部统一安排工作。另一方面，综合商店在生产队党支部直接领导下进行工作，生产队党支部也把综合商店工作列入自己的议事日程，因此综合商店的各项活动就更加紧密地配合农业生产。商店营业员既做买卖，又参加队里的活动，和农民并肩劳动，共同生活，以便深入了解各方面的需要，开展工作。
    这些综合商店里，陈列着农民日常需要的生产资料和生活用品，从镰刀、锄头、兽用药械、毛巾、袜子到针头线脑，一般有两三百种商品。大型机械、农具等商品，商店不备货，如果顾客需要，也可以代为购买。这样，农民买一般商品，就不用跑到集镇上去了。上海县华漕公社宝新生产队，最近在防台风的斗争中急需铅丝、元钉、麻绳等物资，告诉队里的商店，当时店里无货，营业员连夜上镇采购，第二天一早就送货上门。
    综合商店也采取多种多样便利农民的办法，开展农副产品、土特产品和废品的收购工作。除了在门市收购、委托食堂代购以外，营业员还带着日用品串门，边供应、边收购，许多小宗零星的产品因此迅速收购起来。
    在充当生产队党支部组织社员经济生活的助手方面，每个综合商店都有人员专门负责。他们帮助生产队公共食堂种菜、养猪，用好和管好粮食。许多生产队在综合商店帮助下，建立了理发室、洗澡堂、商品修配站等生活服务组织。
    上海郊区各县各公社商业部门，今年来大闹技术革新，合理调整劳动组织，使工作效率大大提高，因此有可能在做好城镇商业工作的同时，抽调一部分人员到生产队开办综合商店，加强对生产第一线的服务工作。
