China News Workers Delegation Visiting Poland Communication

Friends from Afar Ma Qianqing

    As we left Warsaw and flew back to our motherland, we felt boundless joy and excitement. However, the long farewell to our Polish friends filled us with a sense of longing. During our month-long visit to Poland, we traveled around the beautiful and rich Polish land and were warmly received by the Polish people, leaving an indelible impression.

	A Little Girl by the Vistula River

    I most like to recall our meeting with the Polish child Grazyna.

    It was during the first few days of our visit to Poland. We toured the picturesque Kazimierz, which has an ancient castle surrounded by lush trees and green grass, with the quiet Vistula River encircling it like a ribbon of brocade. We leisurely drifted on the river in a light boat for several tens of minutes under the colorful sunset. Upon landing, we saw a little girl playing barefoot in the sand. We teased her, but she calmly and generously told us that she was five years old this year and was on vacation here with her mother from Wrocław. As she spoke, she sized us up with her bright, beautiful eyes and asked us frankly and naively which country we were from. When she learned that we were Chinese, she suddenly told us, "My father is in Guangdong, China, helping to build a sugar factory." We shook her little hand, filled with indescribable excitement. Afterwards, we often thought of this child. She was like a beautiful Ganoderma by the Vistula River, her image constantly flashing in our minds.

    This meeting was accidental, yet it was not. The mutual economic assistance and cooperation and cultural exchange between socialist countries have enabled extensive contact between the peoples of China and Poland. The textile factory in Łódź uses Chinese cotton, and the steel factory in Katowice also imports iron ore from China. Meanwhile, the machine manufacturing factory in Poznań, the shipyard in Gdańsk, and the Warsaw automobile factory have manufactured, are manufacturing, or will manufacture machinery, automobiles, and ships for China. Workers told us that when producing products for China, they demand even higher quality than when producing for their own country. We saw that many departments, factories, and mines had Chinese pennants, ivory carvings, and traditional Chinese paintings given to them by some Chinese factories and enterprises. These are all symbols of the deep friendship between the peoples of China and Poland. The Vice Chairman of the Polish Planning Commission gave a high evaluation of Sino-Polish trade: "Poland's five-year plan will come to a successful conclusion this year, which has promoted the improvement of the material and cultural level of the Polish people. This is the result of the Polish people's selfless labor and the result of close economic cooperation in the socialist camp. China's economic construction achievements are amazing and admirable and are of great significance to Poland's smooth construction of socialism. The commodities received from China have played a major role in the Polish national economy."

    During our stay in Poland, Polish friends often talked about the popularity of Chinese products. Women especially liked Chinese silks and art. The "Chinese Woman" store, which specializes in selling various Chinese handicrafts and is located across from the Warsaw department store, has a daily turnover of 700 million złoty. Comrades in the cultural field praised the Chinese fountain pens they used. The Chairman of the Kraków Journalists Association, Gajda Mieczysław, took out his Chinese fountain pen and said, "This is my sharp sword." Which made us all laugh heartily.

    In Poland, we were delighted to see Chinese goods and excited to hear the Chinese language. One day, we went to the Katowice planetarium in the rain. The machine was turned on, and a distant city night scene appeared all around, the stars became dense, and the moon rose high in the sky. Just as we were feeling at a loss, a burst of Chinese narration suddenly came, which made us see clearly, hear clearly, and feel very cordial in our hearts. This was a Chinese narration recording specially made by the planetarium. Their care for Chinese comrades was meticulous.

	Visit to the Poland-China Friendship Association

    We visited the Poland-China Friendship Association Club. The songs from Chinese records spread far and wide, and the two large Chinese characters for "Happiness" were hung at the door. Comrade Paweł Kołodziej, a member of the Board of the Poland-China Friendship Association, warmly received us and introduced the activities of the Association.

    Since its establishment in 1958, the Poland-China Friendship Association has been very active in its work. It has a total of 300,000 members nationwide. The Association frequently holds reports, seminars, and exhibitions on China's socialist construction and historical and geographical conditions, and screens Chinese films. When major Chinese festivals are celebrated, the Association also organizes celebration meetings and evening parties. Comrade Kołodziej said: "The broad masses of the people support the work of the Poland-China Friendship Association from the bottom of their hearts, and enhance the friendship between the two peoples. In the past, young intellectuals accounted for the largest proportion of the Association's organization, but now they are becoming increasingly active among the working masses. We highly evaluate this development."

    The Poland-China Friendship Association has branches in various provinces and branches in major factories, mines, and counties. In Katowice, we visited the local branch of the Association. We had a hearty conversation with the comrades of the branch, and asked and answered many questions to each other, expressing our concern for each other as friends. We were especially pleased that there were several activists from the Association's groups in agencies and factories and mines with us. They told us that the Bałtyk Steel Plant's Poland-China Friendship Association group has 430 members, and in addition to organizing regular reports and seminars, they also organized a long-distance visit to see the Chinese art exhibition in Kraków Province. They said: Members often ask them, "When can we go to China?"

	Say Hello to Chinese Worker and Farmer Brothers

    We put on miners' clothing and went down into the mine of the Ziemowit Coal Mine to visit the socialist labor team led by Michałczyk of the Ninth Squad. The young men stopped working and gathered around us, talking and laughing. This team is all young people, and two years ago, they won the first place in the national socialist labor competition. This year, they won the first place in the entire mine. The average daily coal production of the national coal mining team is 1,280 tons, while their team reached 1,460 tons. We congratulated them on their future achievements. As we said goodbye, the young men shouted to us: "Greetings to the Chinese miners!"

    After this, we were guests at the home of Jerzy Hędelik, a foreman at the Bałtyk Steel Plant. He, his wife, and three sons warmly received us. He is a worker of steelmaking lineage from his grandfather onwards, and his eldest child is studying at the metallurgical middle school and will be the successor of this steel family. Last year, two Chinese students interned with Jerzy. As we raised our glasses to congratulate this happy family, he said meaningfully, "I hope my whole family can go to China for a vacation." We heartily expressed our welcome, hoping that one day his family would come to our house as guests.

    When we visited the "Bright Future" agricultural production cooperative in Poznań County, the director told us that Polish farmers were very concerned about the achievements of the Chinese People's Communes and wanted us to convey his regards to the members of the Chinese People's Communes. The cooperative members were so enthusiastic about the guests from China that when they heard the news in the morning that the Chinese journalists' delegation was coming, no one wanted to go to work, waiting to meet with us. But at that time, it was the busy harvest season, so the director had to persuade everyone to rush to harvest the crops, leaving a few representatives to accompany us on our visit.

    Those comrades who had visited China before were particularly cordial when they saw us, as if they were reuniting with old friends. We saw Segietynska, the director of the Mazowsze Song and Dance Ensemble, and some members of the ensemble. The elderly director wanted us to greet the Chinese people through the newspaper.

    A month passed in the blink of an eye. We have left Poland and our Polish friends, but our hearts are tightly connected with them. In front of the former residence of Chopin, the outstanding Polish musician, there is a pool. It is said that whoever throws a coin into this pool will have the opportunity to come again. When we visited here, a driver comrade introduced this legend to me and gave each of us a coin to throw into the pool. This coin expresses the wish of this driver comrade, expresses the wish of thousands of Polish people that we will come again, the wish that more Chinese people will come for friendly visits. We believe that his wish—which is also our wish—will be realized.

专栏：中国新闻工作者代表团访波通讯

    远方的朋友	马谦卿
    当我们离开华沙飞返祖国的时候，心里无限地欣喜与激动，而和波兰友人万里遥别，却又使人怅然于怀。在访波的一个月里，我们周游了美丽富饶的波兰国土，受到了波兰人民热情的接待，留下了难以磨灭的印象。
        维斯杜拉河边的小女孩
    我最喜欢回忆我们和波兰孩子格拉席娜的相遇。
    那是在波兰访问的最初几天。我们游览了景色幽美的卡齐密施，这儿有一个古老的城堡，四周林木苍葱，绿草如茵，静静的维斯杜拉河像一根锦带环绕着她。我们在夕照下绚丽多采的河上轻舟漫渡了几十分钟。登上岸边，看到一个小姑娘光着小脚踏着沙土玩。我们便逗她，她却从容大方地告诉我们她今年五岁了，是跟妈妈从伏罗兹瓦夫来到这儿度假的。她一边说话，一边用明亮美丽的眼睛打量着我们，坦爽而天真地问我们是哪一国人。当她知道我们是中国人以后，忽然告诉我们说：“我的爸爸在中国广东帮助建设糖厂。”我们摇着她的小手，说不尽地兴奋。以后我们总是常常想起这个孩子，她像多姿多娇的维斯杜拉河边的一棵灵芝，她的形象不时地闪现在我们的心头。
    这个会见是偶然的，然而又不是偶然的。社会主义国家间经济上的互助合作和文化上的交流，使中波两国人民之间保持了广泛的接触。罗兹的纺织厂用的有中国的棉花，卡多维茨的钢铁厂也有从中国进口的铁矿砂，而波兹南的机器制造厂，革坦斯克的造船厂，华沙汽车厂，曾经制造过、正在制造着、或是将要为中国制造机器、汽车和船舶；工人告诉我们：为中国生产产品时，在质量上比为本国生产时要求还要高。我们看到不少部门、厂矿的办公室里摆设着中国一些厂矿企业单位送给他们的锦旗、象牙雕刻、国画等等，这些都是中波两国人民深厚友谊的标记。波兰计委副主席对中波贸易给以崇高的评价：“波兰的五年计划将于今年胜利结束，它促进了波兰人民物质文化水平的提高。这是波兰人民忘我劳动的结果，是社会主义阵营经济上密切合作的结果。中国经济建设成就使人惊奇和赞扬，对波兰顺利建设社会主义有很大意义，而从中国得到的商品，在波兰国民经济中起了重大作用。”
    我们在波兰的时候，波兰友人常常谈到中国产品备受欢迎的情况。妇女们最喜欢中国的绸缎和艺术品。在华沙百货大楼对门开设的“中国女人”商店，专卖各种中国工艺品，每日营业额达到七亿兹罗提。文化界的同志们则更多地赞美自己使用的中国水笔。克拉科夫记者协会主席盖达·麦契斯瓦夫拿出自己使用的中国水笔说：“这就是我的锋利的剑。”说得我们都呵呵笑了。
    我们在波兰曾为看到中国的物品而欣喜，还因听到中国的语言而激动。有一天，我们冒雨去卡多维茨观看天文馆。机器打开了，四周显现出辽远的城市夜景，星星稠密起来，月亮当空升起，我们正在茫然之间，突然传来一阵中国语解说，使我们看得清楚，听得明了，心里头感到非常亲切。这是天文馆专门配制的中国语解说录音，他们对中国同志的关怀是无微不至的。
          访波中友好协会
    我们访问过波中友协俱乐部。中国唱片的歌声远远地播散出来，两个中国大字“幸福”挂在门口。波中友协理事泡考拉同志热情地接待了我们，并且介绍了友协活动情况。
    波中友协从1958年成立以来，工作开展得很活跃。全国共有三十万会员。友协经常举办关于中国社会主义建设和历史地理情况的报告会、座谈会、展览会，放映中国电影。遇到中国的重大节日，友协还组织庆祝会和晚会。泡考拉同志说：“广大群众从内心里支持波中友协的工作，增进两国人民的友谊。友协组织中过去青年知识分子占的比重最大，现在在工人群众中日益活跃起来，我们对这一发展的评价是很高的。”
    波中友协在各省都有分会，并在各重要厂矿、县里有支会。在卡多维茨时，我们曾拜访了那里的友协分会。我们和分会的同志在一起开怀畅谈，互相提出和回答了许多问题，表明了彼此对朋友的关心。特别使我们高兴的是，在一起有几位机关和厂矿友协小组的活动家。他们告诉我们，拜尔顿钢铁厂波中友协小组有四百三十个会员，除了日常组织报告会、座谈会等以外，还曾组织过一次远途参观——到克拉科夫省去看中国艺术展览会。他们说：会员们经常问他们“我们什么时候可以去中国？”
        向中国工农弟兄问好
    我们穿上矿工的服装，到杰茅维特煤矿的井下，访问了第九分队米哈尔契克领导的社会主义劳动队。小伙子们停下工作围着我们谈笑起来。这个队全是青年，两年前荣获全国社会主义劳动竞赛的第一名，今年获全矿第一名，全国的采煤队平均日产煤炭一千二百八十吨，他们队达到一千四百六十吨。我们祝贺他们未来将获得更大的成就。在告别时，小伙子们冲着我们呼喊：“问候中国的矿工们！”
    在这以后，我们又在拜尔顿钢铁厂工长杰物尤尔·亨达利克家里作客。他和妻子、三个儿子热情地接待了我们。这是一位从祖父开始三代炼钢的血统工人，他的大孩子正在冶金中学学习，将是这个钢铁世家的接班人。去年曾有两个中国留学生跟杰物尤尔实习过。当我们举杯为这个幸福的家庭祝贺的时候，他却意味深长地说：“我希望全家人能到中国去度假。”我们衷心地表示欢迎，但愿有一天他们一家人到我们家里来作客。
    在我们访问波兹南县“光明前途”农业生产合作社时，社长告诉我们说：波兰农民非常关怀中国人民公社的成就，要我们转达他对中国人民公社社员的致意。合作社员对来自中国的客人是这样热情，当他们在早晨听到中国新闻工作者代表团要来的消息时，谁都不愿出工，等着和我们会见。但那时正是收获大忙季节，社长只好劝大家去抢收庄稼，留下几个代表陪我们参观。
    那些曾到中国访问过的同志们，见了我们犹如故友重逢，特别亲热。我们曾看到玛佐夫舍歌舞团的团长塞格廷斯卡和部分团员，这位年长的团长，要我们通过报纸，向中国人民问候。
    一个月的时间，转瞬之间过去了。我们离别了波兰和波兰友人，但我们的心却和他们紧紧地连系在一起。在波兰杰出音乐家萧邦故居的门前，有一个水池，据说谁如果丢一个钱到这个池里，他就有再来的机会。当我们访问这里时，一位汽车司机同志向我介绍了这个传说，并给我们每人一个钱，投入池中。这一个钱表达了这位司机同志、表达了千千万万波兰人民希望我们再来的愿望，希望更多的中国人来作友好访问的愿望。我们相信，他的愿望——也是我们的愿望，是会实现的。
