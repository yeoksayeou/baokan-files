　　尼赫鲁和阿尤布发表会谈公报
　  阿尤布接受邀请将访问印度
    据新华社24日讯　新德里消息：印度总理尼赫鲁同巴基斯坦总统阿尤布举行了四天的会谈后，在23日回到新德里。
    昨天在拉合尔发表的尼赫鲁、阿尤布会谈联合公报说，他们讨论了有关印巴关系问题，并就目前的国际问题非正式地交换了意见。公报说，他们确认，印度河用水问题的解决“为两国政府提供了空前的机会，使它们可以把各自的政策导向促进两国之间的互相谅解和友好合作”。
    公报说：两位领导人“就克什米尔问题坦率而友好地交换了意见，并得出如下结论：这是需要在各方面加以仔细考虑的一个困难问题。（阿尤布）总统和（尼赫鲁）总理一致同意进一步考虑这个问题，以便寻求一项解决办法”。
    公报说尼赫鲁已邀请阿尤布访问印度，阿尤布接受了这一邀请。
    据印度报业托辣斯报道，尼赫鲁23日在拉合尔举行的一次记者招待会上说，在这次会谈中他同阿尤布都渴望解决印度和巴基斯坦之间悬而未决的问题，但是对于目的和对于某些问题——例如克什米尔问题——的态度仍然存在一些分歧。他说，他们讨论了克什米尔问题的各个方面，但是一般说来，这些讨论并没有导致任何具体的结果。
