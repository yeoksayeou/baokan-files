Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an Electric News. Workers at the Xi'an Instrument Factory, displaying the communist spirit of going forward in the face of difficulties and helping those who lag behind, are actively going to remote and arduous areas to support agricultural production. Currently, the factory has been linked up with Shangnan County in the depths of the Qinling Mountains. All the factory's employees are determined to share the joys and hardships of the local masses, work hard, and change the backwardness of local agricultural production.

The Xi'an Instrument Factory is a large modern factory, with most of its workers being junior high school and complete primary school graduates. The factory's leading backbone are cadres who have undergone long-term revolutionary training in old revolutionary base areas such as northern Shaanxi. They have brought the fine traditions of hard work, diligence, and thrift from the old revolutionary base areas to industrial construction. Since the establishment of the factory, they have regularly educated young workers about diligence, thrift, and hard work. This year, in the province-wide movement to learn from the style of Gao Yi, a cadre from Yulin, the workers of the Xi'an Instrument Factory have further enhanced their ideological awareness and voluntarily proposed going to the most remote and arduous areas to support agricultural production.

When the Provincial Industrial Support Agriculture Committee approved the factory to link up with Shangnan County in the depths of the Qinling Mountains, the entire factory was excited, and they all took it as an honor to undertake the task of supporting agricultural production in the old revolutionary base area. They said: When drinking water, don't forget the well-diggers. Without the hard work of the people in the old revolutionary base areas in the past, there would be no such modern large factories. The people of the old revolutionary base areas have made great contributions in the revolutionary struggle. Now, due to natural conditions, inconvenient transportation, and other reasons, they have more difficulties in agricultural production and technological transformation than the plains areas. We should take the lead in undertaking the task of support. The workers asked to go to Shangnan one after another, and proposed: Guarantee to share joys and hardships with the local masses.

Based on the factory's investigation and understanding, Shangnan County is full of rocky mountains and barren land, and there are many difficulties in agricultural production. The county's industrial base and technical strength are also relatively weak. The entire county only has a farm machinery repair and manufacturing plant with four or five indigenous lathes. Because of the small number of equipment and the lack of matching parts, many agricultural machines and irrigation equipment cannot be repaired in time when they are broken. However, the local hundreds of thousands of hardworking and brave people in the old revolutionary base area have a strong desire and soaring enthusiasm to quickly change this "poor and blank" situation. The area has very rich mineral resources, and the local people have also accumulated a lot of experience in producing industrial raw materials such as native iron.

The Xi'an Instrument Factory, starting from these specific local conditions and in the spirit of diligence and thrift, jointly formulated a plan to support agriculture with the county and communes. For example, when helping the Shangnan County Farm Machinery Factory to change the situation of having too little equipment and lacking matching parts, they actively helped the factory to transform existing equipment and tap the potential of existing equipment. The factory did not have a milling machine, and many equipment could not be processed. If they asked the state to allocate or help them manufacture a milling machine, the cost would be high and it would not be solved immediately, and it would be very low utilization rate to specially equip a small factory with a milling machine. After collective research, the workers helped the factory to manufacture a universal milling head, which could be used as a milling machine when installed on the existing lathe. None of the Shangnan Farm Machinery Factory's several indigenous lathes had chucks. During production, several screws had to be temporarily used to clamp the parts for processing, which was both labor-intensive and could not guarantee the output and quality of the products. They helped the factory to manufacture several chucks, which doubled the work efficiency of the four lathes. At the same time, they also helped the factory produce equipment such as indigenous air hammers and flat plate presses, so that the factory's equipment could be matched into sets and undertake the task of farm machinery production and repair in Shangnan County.

The Xi'an Instrument Factory also helped the county promote the advanced experience of using gas to save coal in view of the lack of coal and transportation difficulties in Shangnan County. In order to solve the electricity problem in agricultural technology transformation in Shangnan County, the Xi'an Instrument Factory is actively trial-producing a small and portable generator suitable for mountainous areas.

In order to solve the problem of insufficient technical force in the county and communes, they also helped train 100 mechanical repair and manufacturing technicians and 30 civil construction workers.

Since the Xi'an Instrument Factory linked up with Shangnan County, it has not only supported local agricultural production, but also humbly learned the local people's style of diligence, thrift, and hard work.

### 见困难就上　见后进就帮  西安仪表厂主动支援山区

    见困难就上　见后进就帮
    西安仪表厂主动支援山区
    据新华社西安电　西安仪表厂职工发扬见困难就上、见后进就帮的共产主义风格，积极到偏僻而艰苦的地区去支援农业生产。目前，这个厂已经同秦岭深山区的商南县挂上了钩。全厂职工决心跟当地的群众同甘共苦，艰苦奋斗，改变当地农业生产的落后面貌。
    西安仪表厂是一个大型现代化工厂，绝大部分工人都是初中和完小毕业的学生。厂的领导骨干都是过去在陕北等老根据地经过长期革命锻炼的干部，他们把老区艰苦奋斗、勤俭朴素的优良传统带到工业建设中来。建厂以来，他们经常对青年职工进行勤俭朴素和艰苦奋斗的教育。今年，在全省干部学习榆林干部高毅的风格的运动中，西安仪表厂职工进一步提高了思想觉悟，自动提出到最偏僻、最艰苦的地区去支援农业生产。
    当省工业支援农业委员会批准这个厂同秦岭深山区的商南县挂钩的时候，全厂人心振奋，都以担负起支援老区农业生产的任务为荣。他们说：吃水不忘掘井人，没有老区人民过去的艰苦奋斗，就没有这些现代化的大工厂。老根据地人民在革命斗争中立下了丰功伟绩，现在由于自然条件和交通不便等原因，他们在农业生产和技术改造方面比平原地区困难多一些，我们应该首先担负起支援的任务。职工们纷纷要求到商南去，并且提出：保证同当地群众同甘共苦。
    根据这个厂的调查了解，商南县石山林立，土地瘠薄，农业生产上困难比较多；这个县的工业基础和技术力量也比较薄弱，全县只有一个四、五台土车床的农械修造厂，因设备数量少、不配套，很多农业机械和排灌设备等坏了不能及时修复。但是当地十几万勤劳勇敢的老区人民，对迅速改变这种“一穷二白”的面貌有着强烈的愿望和冲天的干劲；当地有非常丰富的矿产资源；当地人民生产土铁等工业原料也积累了不少经验。
    西安仪表厂从当地这些具体情况出发，并本着克勤克俭的精神，同县和公社共同制订了支援农业的规划。例如他们在帮助商南县农械厂改变设备少、不配套的情况时，就积极帮助这个厂改造现有设备，挖掘现有设备潜力。这个厂没有铣床，很多设备不能加工，如果要求国家调拨或帮助他们制造一台铣床，成本既高一时也解决不了，而且小厂专门配备一台铣床，利用率很低。工人们经过集体研究，帮助厂里制造了一个万能铣头，安在现有的车床上就可以当铣床用。商南农械厂的几台土车床都没有夹头，生产时需要临时上几个螺丝把零件卡住进行加工，既费工又不能保证产品的产量和质量。他们就帮助厂里制造了几个夹头，使四台车床的工效都提高了一倍多。同时，他们还帮助这个厂生产了土空气锤、平板压力机等设备，使厂的设备配成套，担负起商南县农械生产和修配的任务。
    西安仪表厂还根据商南县煤炭缺乏、运输困难的情况，帮助县里推广使用煤气的先进经验，以节约用煤。为了解决商南县农业技术改造中的用电问题，西安仪表厂正在积极试制一种适合山区用的小型轻便发电机。
    为了解决县和公社技术力量不足的问题，他们还帮助培养机械修配和机械制造技工一百名，土建工人三十名。
    西安仪表厂同商南县挂钩以后，不仅支援了当地的农业生产，同时也虚心学习了当地人民克勤克俭、艰苦奋斗的作风。
