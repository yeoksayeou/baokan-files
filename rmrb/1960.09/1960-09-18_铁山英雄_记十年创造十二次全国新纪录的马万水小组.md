    Iron Mountain Hero
    ——Record of the Ma Wanshui Group's Twelve National Records in Ten Years	Lǚ Mín
    The nationally renowned "Thoroughbred Horse" – the Ma Wanshui Group of the Longyan Iron and Steel Company's Tunnel Engineering Company, is a fast-tunneling red banner that never fades. For ten years, they have fought under the Red Stone Mountain of the ancient Pangjiabao Iron Mine, opening up underground tunnels that stretch for dozens of miles. Wherever this heroic team goes, they are invincible and overcome all obstacles. In March of this year, they came to the Yangjiaying construction site and successively set three new tunneling records. In the Red May, deep within the steel-like rock, they opened up a high and wide underground corridor of more than six hundred and twenty meters long, reaching the new peak of national fast tunneling for the twelfth time.
    What power has enabled this heroic group to continuously move from one victory to another? It is the Party's teachings and the constant development of their advanced thinking. Look! The sparks of communist ideology shine so brightly in this group.
        Stubborn Rocks Bow Their Heads, Quicksand Gives Way
    The heroic road is always accompanied by thousands of difficulties. Underground quicksand and faults, like a roadblock, often block the way of the tunneling team. In the last two years alone, they have overcome more than twenty such obstacles. Once, the rock on the active ground suddenly became as hard as steel. Sparks flew everywhere when drilling began. After only a few minutes, the whole body was numb, and the machine was hot, panting heavily. Drilling a blast hole took twice as long as usual. Seeing that the completion of the task would be affected, everyone was anxious, but no one was willing to bow their heads to the stubborn rocks and admit defeat in the face of difficulties. Group leader Guo Jincai gathered together the drilling experts Tian Junru, Wang Youcheng, Liu Liangui, and others. "The rock is too hard, we can't attack it head-on. Drill as few holes as possible. If we can't attack from the front, we'll attack from the sides. If one slot doesn't work, we'll do a second slot." Everyone contributed their ideas in a "Zhuge Liang Meeting," and finally agreed on a secondary blasting method. After the team leaders went back, they personally led the drilling and conducted experiments. Sure enough, the stubborn rocks bowed their heads, and the work efficiency was increased by more than one and a half times.
    In the technical innovation and technical revolution movement centered on the "Four Modernizations," they have adhered to the spirit of "putting 'do' first, and 'skill' paves the way," and have successively created various operating methods such as slotting forms and blast hole arrangements, and improved more than twenty advanced tools and equipment such as rock drills, rock loaders, and floating turnouts, increasing work efficiency by one to four times respectively, further arming themselves, and the tunneling speed is like the seedlings in spring, growing faster and faster.
          Always Maintain the Red Banner
    A mountain climber always hopes to climb to the top of the peak, and a heroic team is always upward. No matter which advanced tunneling team in the company or province creates a new record, as soon as it is passed to the Ma Wanshui Group, they will definitely chase after it. One day in mid-March, the workers on the early shift had already left work. Everyone squatted under the telephone pole, quietly listening to the broadcast: "The Red Banner Team of Pit One of the Pangjiabao Iron Mine is speeding up, advancing 23.4 meters per day, surpassing the Ma Wanshui Group..." The comrades were both happy and anxious at the time; happy that the brother team was making great strides, and anxious that the group's advanced record had fallen behind. Just as everyone was clamoring, team leader Wang Youcheng got off work. After finding out the situation, he didn't say a word, didn't even eat, and led a group of people to the Red Banner Team on a material truck to visit. That night, another intense and enthusiastic Zhuge Liang meeting was held on the battlefield. The group leader said to everyone, "Comrades, we have maintained the red banner of fast tunneling for ten years, and we must continue to maintain it. No matter when, we must strive to be upstream and upstream again!" In this way, the whole group worked together with one heart and one mind, adopting advanced measures such as deep-hole blasting, multi-cycle, and parallel operations, successively creating new records of 25.4 meters, 29.7 meters, and 30.8 meters per day, and they took the lead again.
            Thousands of Miles to Seek "Experience"
    Every year and every month, the group's work site often receives guests from all over the country to visit. The group's workers feel infinitely excited that their experience can be promoted among tunneling workers across the country. However, they are never satisfied with the achievements they have made. They often visit brother mines to seek experience humbly and make up for their shortcomings. In July of this year, the "Thousands of Miles to Seek Experience Visiting Group" led by Comrade Ma Wanshui was formed, and successively went to Jixi, Huatong, Kailuan and other mines in the Northeast to learn a lot of advanced experience. Comrade Pang Hongli, who went to visit on behalf of the group, was attracted by a new type of automatic hook he saw in the Huatong Mine. The next day after returning to the mine, he found technicians and mechanics to study and manufacture two of them. After putting them into production, they improved work efficiency by more than double compared to the original manual hooks. Other advanced experiences of brother factories and mines quickly blossomed and bore fruit in the group. After adding an air pocket to the wind drill pipe, the air volume increased by 20%. The result of adopting the water inlet on the side of the machine head not only prolonged the life of the drill bit but also increased the speed by more than 30%.
            Not Letting Comrades Fall Behind
    Not far from the Ma Wanshui Group's work site, their comrades - Team Seven, are undertaking the tunneling task of a key project. The rock there has a hardness of more than 130 grades, and the water is high, so the progress is always slow. When the workers of Team Seven were worried about not being able to complete the task, the Ma Wanshui Group learned about the difficulties they were encountering. Group leader Guo Jincai thought, "We should 'learn from the advanced, help the backward, we can't just stand by and watch.'" The engineer, who was a worker himself and has been engaged in tunneling work for many years, immediately found Pang Hongli, a well-known all-rounder in the group, and the two came to Team Seven together. As soon as they got to the work site, the two grabbed a wind drill and started working, drilling a cycle in more than forty minutes. In a while, they pointed out the drilling, and in a while, they greeted the slag removal, arranging the work in an organized manner. Before long, boom, the cannon rang, and three or four tons of rock collapsed, and the workers of Team Seven applauded happily.
    At this time, Lao Guo thought again: "It's not enough to just help! Once people leave, won't it be the same as before!" He immediately found the leader of Team Seven and said: "Lao Pang and I will follow you for a few days. You do it yourselves, and we will watch from the side. If you don't master it well, we won't go back to the team."
    In the past, when tunneling, Team Seven did not pay attention to the center line, and often deviated the roadway, so they had to go back and brush the help again. Lao Guo discovered this key point a long time ago, and he taught them the group's method of mastering the specifications according to the track without reservation. But he was still not at ease, so he found the workers of Team Seven and held a symposium, comprehensively imparting the group's entire set of operating and management experience. In less than a few days, the progress of Team Seven caught up, increasing from eight cycles per day to eleven cycles. When Lao Guo and Lao Pang were about to leave, they repeatedly said: "Comrades, if you encounter any difficulties, let us know, and we will come to support you again."

    铁山英雄
    ——记十年创造十二次全国新纪录的马万水小组	吕民
    全国闻名的“千里驹”——龙烟钢铁公司井巷工程公司马万水小组，是一面永不褪色的快速掘进红旗。十年来，他们战斗在古老的庞家堡铁矿红石山下，打通了纵横数十里的地下坑道。英雄队伍所到之处，战无不胜，攻无不克。今年3月间，他们来到了杨家营工地上又接连创造了三次掘进新纪录。红五月里，在坚如钢铁的岩石深处，打通了一条又高又宽、长达六百二十多米的地下长廊，第十二次登上了全国快速掘进的新高峰。
    是什么力量，使得这个英雄小组不断地从一个胜利走向另一个新的胜利呢？是党的教导，是他们的先进思想的不断发扬光大。看！共产主义思想的火花，在这个小组里是多么光彩夺目。
        顽石低头，流砂让路
    英雄的道路总是伴随着千百个困难走过来的。地下的流砂、断层，像一只拦路虎，常常挡住掘进队员们的去路。单是最近两年，他们闯过的关口，就有二十几处。有一次，活地上的岩石突然硬得像钢铁一样，开钻的地方只见火花四射，打不了几分钟，就全身发麻，机器也热得滚烫，喘着粗气，打一次炮眼要比平常多花费一倍的时间。眼看完成任务要受到影响，大伙儿着急了，但是谁也不愿意向顽石低头，在困难面前认输。大组长郭进才把打眼能手田俊儒、王有成、刘连贵等都找来了。“岩石太硬，不能硬碰，炮眼尽量少打，正面进攻不了，就侧面夹击，一次掏槽不好，来个二次掏槽。”大伙你一言我一句地开了诸葛亮会，最后合计好了一个二次爆破的方法，各班组长回去后，都亲自领钎开眼，带头试验，果然，顽石低头了，而且提高了工效一倍半以上。
    在以“四化”为中心的技术革新和技术革命运动中，他们本着“干字当头，巧字开路”的精神，又先后创造了掏槽形式、炮眼排列等多种操作方法，改进了凿岩机、装岩机、浮放道岔等二十多种先进工具和设备，分别提高工效一至四倍，进一步武装了自己，掘进速度像是春天里的树苗越长越快了。
          永远保持住红旗
    一个登山运动员，总是希望攀登到高峰的顶点，一个英雄小组总是永远向上的。不管公司、省内外，哪一个先进掘进小组创造了新纪录，一传到马万水小组，他们一定就要紧追紧赶。3月中旬的一天，上早白班的工人已经下班了，大家蹲在电线杆下静静地收听广播：“庞家堡铁矿一坑红旗队快马加鞭，日进二十三点四米，超过了马万水小组……”。同志们当时又高兴又着急；高兴的是兄弟组队在突飞猛进，着急的是小组的先进纪录已经落后了。大伙正嚷嚷着，小组长王有成下班了，他问明了情况，二话没说，连饭都没有吃，就带领着一批人马搭上了材料车，到红旗队参观去了。当晚，一场紧张热烈的诸葛亮会又在战地上召开了。大组长对大伙说：“同志们，快速掘进的红旗，我们保持了十年一定还要保持下去，我们无论在什么时候，都要力争上游再上游！”就这样，全组一条心一股劲，采取了深眼爆破、多循环、平行作业等先进措施，接连创造了日进二十五点四米、二十九点七米、三十点八米的新纪录，他们又领先了。
            千里取“经”
    每年每月，在小组的活地上经常要接待从全国各地来参观的客人，小组的工人们为自己的经验能够在全国掘进工人中推广而感到无限兴奋。但是，他们总是不满足已经取得的成绩，经常还要到兄弟矿山去登门拜访和虚心求经，弥补自己的不足。今年7月份，以马万水同志为首的“千里取经参观团”组成了，前后到东北鸡西、华铜和开滦等矿山学习了不少先进经验。代表小组前去参观的庞宏利同志，被在华铜矿看到的一种新型的自动挂钩吸引住了。回到矿山的第二天，就找技术员和机械师一起研究制造了两个，投入生产后，比原来人工挂钩提高工效一倍多。兄弟厂矿的其他先进经验也很快在小组开花结果了。在风钻管子上增加风包后，使风量增长了20％，采取机头侧进水的结果，不但延长了钎子头寿命，而且提高转速30％以上。
            不让战友掉队
    离马万水小组不远的工地上，他们的战友——七组，正担负着一项重点工程的掘进任务。那里的岩石硬度达到一百三十多级，水又大，进度老是上不去。七组的工人们正在怕完不成任务而发愁的时候，马万水小组知道了他们遇到的困难，大组长郭进才心里想，应该“见先进就学，见后进就帮，咱不能看着不管。”这个从事多年掘进工作、工人出身的工程师，马上找到小组有名的多面手庞宏利，两人一块儿来到了七组。一上活地，两人抢了一台风钻就干了起来，四十多分钟打了一个循环，一会儿他们又指点打眼，一会儿招呼出渣，把工作安排得条条是道。不大工夫，轰隆隆，炮响了，岩石一下崩下来三、四吨，七组的工人们高兴得鼓起掌来。
    这时候老郭又想：“光帮助干还不行？人一走，还不是老样子！”他马上找到七组组长说：“我和老庞跟你们几天，你们自己干，我们在旁边看，你们掌握不好，我们不回队。”
    七组过去掘进时，不看中线，把巷道经常打偏了，只得返回去再刷帮，这个关键老早就被老郭发觉了，他就把自己小组按照轨道掌握规格的办法，毫无保留地教给了他们。但是他还不放心，又找七组的工人们开了个座谈会，全面传授了小组操作和管理上的整套经验，不到几天，七组的进度赶上来了，由日进八个循环提高到十一个循环。老郭和老庞临走时还一再地说：“同志们遇到啥困难，关照一声，我们再来支援你们。”（附图片）
