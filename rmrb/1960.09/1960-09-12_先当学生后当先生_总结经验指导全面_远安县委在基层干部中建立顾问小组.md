Having been a student first and then a teacher, summing up experience to provide comprehensive guidance: Yuan'an County Committee establishes advisory groups among grassroots cadres.

(Reported by our newspaper) The Chinese Communist Party Yuan'an County Committee in Hubei Province has selected outstanding individuals from grassroots cadres in management districts, production teams, and production squads to form County Committee "Advisory Groups" in order to enrich and supplement leadership experience.

The members participating in the County Committee "Advisory Groups" all possess rich experience in mass work, as well as extensive agricultural production knowledge and technical expertise. They are all grassroots model cadres who are diligent in their work, maintain a thorough work style, earnestly implement the Party's guidelines and policies, and maintain close ties with the masses. The County Committee, adhering to the spirit of first being a student and then a teacher, consults with members of the "Advisory Groups" on matters, invites them to attend relevant County Committee meetings to listen to their opinions, and sometimes sends County Committee members to reside in the grassroots units where the "Advisors" are located to live with them and jointly study and resolve problems existing in production. The Yuan'an County Committee gains an understanding of grassroots conditions through the "Advisory Groups," thereby making leadership more concrete and meticulous. For example, after cadres went deep into the front lines and settled in production squads, new problems arose, such as how to assist the squad cadres in their work and how to serve as good advisors. The County Committee's First Secretary and other key members went separately to the grassroots units where several "Advisors" were located to study this issue with them. As a result, they identified the "three helps" leadership method, which involves helping squad cadres grasp the Party's guidelines and policies, helping analyze situations and problems, and helping generate ideas and solutions. After the "three helps" were promoted throughout the county, the leadership of the squads was greatly strengthened, and the working ability of the squad cadres was significantly improved. At the same time, the County Committee, through the "Advisory Group" method, first acted as a student and then as a teacher, promptly discovering and summarizing advanced experiences, enriching leadership, and providing comprehensive guidance. This year, after the county's production entered the busy season focused on field management of major autumn crops, the County Committee promptly visited the rice "expert" Wang Benyi and learned from Wang Benyi's five-character experience in rice cultivation: "early, fast, meticulous, skillful, and precise." This changed the past generalized approach of simply calling for weeding and fertilizer application, enabling the county's rice field management to be carried out quickly and well, promoting increased production and bountiful harvests.

Since establishing the "Advisory Groups" among grassroots cadres, the Yuan'an County Committee has gained a better understanding of the actual situation by frequently incorporating the opinions of grassroots cadres, making its work more practical and powerfully promoting the development of production. When the county was vigorously engaged in land reclamation and multiple planting for higher yields, the County Committee originally planned to reclaim land on both the mountains and the plains. Yu Shundian, the General Branch Secretary of the Taiping Management District in the Chengguan Commune and one of the "Advisors," raised a different opinion. He advocated reclaiming the land at the foot of the mountains first and then reclaiming the land on the mountains. Based on his experience in land reclamation last year, he explained that in high mountains above 1,300-1,400 meters above sea level, the summer crops mature twenty days to a month later than those at the foot of the mountains due to the cold climate. If winter crops are planted this year, it will be too late to plant spring corn next year. Under the current circumstances of many tasks and tight labor, reclaiming the land at the foot of the mountains first and then reclaiming the land on the mountains can yield an extra season and more grain. After studying his opinion, the County Committee changed its original plan and made a new deployment to concentrate its main forces on reclaiming the land at the foot of the mountains first, thereby achieving significant results.

    先当学生后当先生　总结经验指导全面
    远安县委在基层干部中建立顾问小组
    本报讯　中共湖北省远安县委选拔管理区、生产队和生产小队等基层干部中的优秀分子，组成县委“顾问小组”，以充实和丰富领导经验。
    参加县委“顾问小组”的成员都有丰富的群众工作经验，并有丰富的农业生产知识和技术专长，都是工作踏实，作风深入，能认真贯彻党的方针政策，密切联系群众的基层模范干部。县委本着先当学生后当先生的精神，有事就找“顾问小组”的成员一起商量，并吸收他们列席一定的县委会议，听取他们的意见；有时就派县委成员住到“顾问”的所在基层单位，和他们一起生活，共同研究和解决生产中存在的问题。远安县委通过“顾问小组”了解基层情况，因此，领导更加具体、细致。比如干部深入第一线、到生产小队落户后，产生了下去后如何帮助小队干部工作、当好参谋的新问题。县委第一书记和县委其他主要成员，就分头深入到几个“顾问”所在的基层单位去，和他们一起研究这个问题，结果找出了“三帮”的领导办法，即帮助小队干部掌握党的方针政策，帮助分析情况和问题，帮助出主意想办法。“三帮”在全县推广后，大大加强了小队的领导，小队干部的工作能力显著提高。同时，县委通过“顾问小组”的办法，先当学生，后当先生，及时发现和总结先进经验，丰富领导，指导全面。今年全县生产进入以大秋作物田间管理为中心的农忙季节后，县委及时访问了水稻“专家”王本义，从王本义那里学习了“早、快、细、巧、精”的五字水稻培育经验，改变了过去一般化号召除草追肥的领导办法，使全县水稻田间管理又快又好，促进了增产丰收。
    远安县委在基层干部中建立“顾问小组”以后，由于经常吸收基层干部的意见，更多的了解了实际情况，使工作更加切合实际，有力地推动了生产的发展。在全县大搞开荒、多种多收时，县委原来打算山上山下一齐开荒，“顾问”之一、城关公社太平管理区总支书记余顺典提出了不同的意见。他主张先开山下，再开山上，并根据他去年开荒的经验，说明拔海一千三、四百米以上的高山，因为气候冷，夏收作物成熟期要比山下迟二十天到一个月，今年种上了越冬作物，明年就赶不上种春苞谷。在当前活路多劳力紧的情况下，先开山下，开完山下再开山上，可多捞一季，多收粮食。县委根据他的意见经过研究后，改变了原来的计划，作出了集中主要力量先开山下的新部署，从而获得了显著的效果。
