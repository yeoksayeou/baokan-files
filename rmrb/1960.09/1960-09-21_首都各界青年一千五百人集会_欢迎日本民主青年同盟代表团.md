Xinhua News Agency, September 20th: Fifteen hundred youths from all circles in the capital held a rally at the Central Institute for Nationalities tonight to warmly welcome the delegation of the Japanese Democratic Youth League.

Li Menghua, Vice Chairman of the All-China Youth Federation, Hu Keshi and Liang Buting, Secretaries of the Secretariat of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Youth League, and Zhou Shixian, Deputy Secretary of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Youth League, attended tonight's meeting.

Li Menghua, Vice Chairman of the All-China Youth Federation, spoke at the meeting. First, on behalf of the youth of the capital and all of China, he extended a warm welcome and high respect to the heroic delegation of the Japanese Democratic Youth League.

Li Menghua said that 130 million Chinese youths fully support the Japanese youth and the Japanese people's patriotic and just struggle against U.S. imperialism, and Chinese youth will always be the loyal friends of Japanese youth.

Li Menghua warmly praised the great achievements made by the Japanese Democratic Youth League in the anti-U.S. patriotic and just struggle. He said that under the leadership of the Japanese Communist Party, the Japanese Democratic Youth League united the vast number of Japanese youths and bravely stood at the forefront of the anti-U.S. just struggle, making contributions to striving for Japan's national independence and opposing U.S. imperialism's aggression and enslavement.

Li Menghua said that we firmly believe that the patriotic and just struggle of the Japanese people and youth to abolish the Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty, oppose the revival of Japanese militarism, demand the abolition of U.S. military bases, and strive for national independence and democratic rights will ultimately achieve a complete victory with the strong support of the people of the world.

Li Menghua finally pointed out that U.S. imperialism is still blatantly expanding its arms and preparing for war, strengthening the revival of West German and Japanese militarism, strengthening aggressive military blocs, plotting to interfere in and invade Cuba, and actively carrying out conspiracies to interfere in, divide, and annex the Congo, and still occupies Japan's Okinawa Island and China's territory of Taiwan. All this shows that U.S. imperialism is the number one enemy of world peace and the most dangerous enemy of the national independence movement. Resolutely opposing U.S. imperialism's policies of aggression and war and opposing the revival of Japanese militarism is the common task of the Chinese and Japanese people and youth.

Maeda Minoru, head of the Japanese Democratic Youth League delegation, spoke amid warm applause. He said, on behalf of all revolutionary youths in Japan, I extend warm brotherly greetings to our Chinese youth friends, and on behalf of the Japanese people and all the youth, I sincerely thank the Chinese people for the great support they gave us in the struggle against the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty."

Maeda Minoru said that, thanks to the support of the people of all countries, we further realize that the Japanese people's struggle against the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" is an important part of the struggle of the people of the world to oppose imperialism and defend world peace.

After Maeda Minoru gave a detailed introduction to the struggle situation of the twenty-second unified action carried out by Japanese youth, workers, and farmers to oppose U.S. imperialism, he said that the victory of our struggle dealt a heavy blow to U.S. imperialism's policy of aggression and greatly encouraged the people of the world who are striving for peace and complete disarmament. From this struggle, we deeply felt the power of unity. Therefore, we are more confident in carrying out unremitting struggle for the realization of Japan's peace, independence, democracy, and neutrality.

Maeda Minoru said that recently, the Japanese people's call for the restoration of Sino-Japanese diplomatic relations has been rising. However, the Ikeda government is trying its best to prevent the people from realizing this wish. He pointed out that U.S. imperialism has established military bases in Japan and adopted a policy of hostility towards the Soviet Union and China, and the Ikeda government is cooperating with it. However, the Chinese youth and people who stand at the forefront of the struggle for peace and socialist construction are brothers of the Japanese youth and the Japanese people, and we are close comrades-in-arms on the front line of opposing our common enemy, U.S. imperialism. He said that we believe that through this visit, the friendship between the youth of China and Japan will be further deepened. Finally, he presented the All-China Youth Federation with a banner that read: "Youth of China and Japan unite and drive U.S. imperialism out of Asia!" At this moment, the whole audience burst into thunderous applause.

After the meeting, the Chinese film "Thousands of Rivers and Mountains" was shown.

    首都各界青年一千五百人集会
　　欢迎日本民主青年同盟代表团
    据新华社20日讯　首都各界青年一千五百人，今晚在中央民族学院举行集会，热烈欢迎日本民主青年同盟代表团。
    中华全国青年联合会副主席李梦华，中国共产主义青年团中央委员会书记处书记胡克实、梁步庭，北京市共青团市委副书记周世贤等出席了今晚的大会。
    全国青联副主席李梦华在会上讲话。他首先代表首都和全中国青年向英勇的日本民主青年同盟代表团表示热烈的欢迎和崇高的敬意。
    李梦华说，一亿三千万中国青年全力支持日本青年和日本人民的反对美帝爱国正义斗争，中国青年将永远是日本青年的忠实朋友。
    李梦华热情地赞扬日本民主青年同盟在反美爱国正义斗争中所取得的伟大成就。他说，日本民主青年同盟在日本共产党的领导下，团结广大日本青年英勇地站在反美正义斗争的前列，为争取日本的民族独立和反对美帝国主义的侵略和奴役作出了贡献。
    李梦华说，我们坚信，日本人民和青年为废除日美军事同盟条约、反对复活日本军国主义、要求取消美国军事基地、争取民族独立和民主权利而进行的爱国正义斗争，在全世界人民有力地支持下，最后一定会取得彻底胜利。
    李梦华最后指出，美帝国主义仍然明目张胆地进行扩军备战，加强复活西德和日本军国主义，加强侵略性的军事集团，阴谋干涉和侵略古巴，积极进行干涉、分裂和鲸吞刚果的阴谋活动，仍然侵占着日本的冲绳岛，侵占着中国的领土台湾。这一切都说明美帝国主义是世界和平的头号敌人，是民族独立运动最危险的敌人，坚决反对美帝国主义侵略政策和战争政策、反对复活日本军国主义，是中日两国人民和青年的共同任务。
    日本民主青年同盟代表团团长前田稔在热烈的掌声中讲话。他说，我代表日本一切革命青年向中国青年朋友致以热烈的兄弟般的问候，代表日本人民和全体青年衷心地感谢中国人民给予我们在反对日美“安全条约”斗争中伟大的支持。
    前田稔说，由于各国人民的支持，使我们进一步感到日本人民反对日美“安全条约”的斗争，是全世界人民为反对帝国主义和保卫世界和平所进行的斗争的重要一环。
    前田稔详细地介绍了日本青年、工人、农民为反对美帝国主义所进行的二十二次统一行动的斗争情况后说，我们斗争的胜利，给美帝国主义的侵略政策以沉重的打击，对争取和平和全面裁军的全世界人民很大的鼓励。从这次斗争中，我们深深感到团结的力量。因此，我们更有信心为实现日本的和平、独立、民主、中立而进行不懈的斗争。
    前田稔说，最近，日本人民要求恢复中日邦交的呼声日益高涨，但池田政府尽量想法阻止人民实现这种愿望。他指出，美帝国主义在日本设立军事基地，采取敌视苏联和中国的政策，池田政府和它合作。但是，站在争取和平和进行社会主义建设最前线的中国青年和人民是日本青年和日本人民的兄弟，我们在反对共同敌人美帝国主义的战线上是亲密的战友。他说，我们相信，通过这次访问，将更进一步加深中日两国青年的友谊。最后他向全国青联赠送了一面写有：“中日两国青年团结起来，把美帝国主义从亚洲赶出去！”的锦旗。这时，全场掌声雷动。
    大会结束后，放映了我国电影“万水千山”。
