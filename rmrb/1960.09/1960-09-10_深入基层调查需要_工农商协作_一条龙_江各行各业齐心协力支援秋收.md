In-depth Investigation at the Grassroots Requires "One-Stop" Cooperation Between Workers, Peasants, and Merchants
?jiang's Various Industries and Trades Work Together to Support the Autumn Harvest
More Than Half of the County's Production and Repair of Farm Tools Has Been Completed, and Most of the Drying Grounds and Warehouses Are Ready

According to Yunnan Daily News, ?jiang County, Yunnan Province, has launched a mass movement to support the autumn harvest from all walks of life, actively preparing to seize increased production and income of autumn grain.

Everyone Supports the Autumn Harvest

A decisive battle for ?jiang County to seize increased production and income of autumn grain is about to begin. In order to do a quick and good job in preparing for the autumn harvest, the county party committee sent a secretary to lead responsible cadres from industrial and commercial departments to conduct investigations and research in the representative Jihua Commune. They went to the fields and saw that the rice was generally budding and heading; they went to the teams and heard that the masses were eager to harvest and manage the autumn grain well. The commune members said: "A year of hard work depends on the autumn harvest. We would rather wait for the rice to ripen than let the rice wait for people." The working group and the cadres of each team carefully calculated the planted area, the harvesting time, the labor force participating in the autumn harvest, and the required materials. After careful analysis and research, they found that this year's autumn harvest has the characteristics of "early, more, and uniform." Early means that the rice matures earlier. The maturity period of the 24,000 mu of rice planted in the commune will be ten days earlier than last year; more means that the planted area is 9% more than last year, the density of planting per mu is 25% more than last year, and the labor force participating in the harvest is 10% more than last year; uniform means that the large area matures consistently, with 65% of the rice concentrated for harvesting in mid-to-late September. To strive for as much grain as possible, it is necessary to adhere to the principle of harvesting at the right time, achieving quick harvesting, quick threshing, quick transportation, quick drying, and quick storage; at the same time, special attention should be paid to the quality of harvesting and threshing, meticulous harvesting and careful threshing, to ensure that every grain is stored in the warehouse. According to the requirements of "early, more, uniform, quick, and good," this commune needs to purchase 40%-50% more large farm tools than last year, and 30% more small farm tools than last year; 80% of the existing large farm tools need to be repaired, and 40% of the existing small farm tools need to be repaired; the demand for drying grounds and warehouses will also increase by about 100%.

The county party committee further studied the situation of the whole county. The whole county needs to purchase about 50% more large farm tools such as threshing machines than last year, and about 30% more small farm tools such as sickles than last year. The number of original large and small farm tools that need to be repaired is also very large; however, there is only one month left before the sickle harvest. Therefore, party organizations at all levels mobilized the whole party and the whole people by industry and commune, and a upsurge of "everyone cares about the autumn harvest, everyone supports the autumn harvest" was quickly set off throughout the county.

Close Cooperation Between Workers, Peasants, and Merchants

With the masses mobilized, the urgent problem to be solved is how to organize production and supply in a led and planned manner, and to meet the needs of the autumn harvest quickly, well, and quickly. The county party committee adopted the method of going straight to the end, and convened a "four-way" meeting attended by cadres from the county, commune, and management district agricultural, industrial, commercial, and financial departments. The agricultural departments at all levels were asked to present their needs, the commercial departments to present their inventory, the industrial departments to present their production, and the financial departments to present their funds, to jointly solve some of the problems existing between needs and manufacturing, sales and needs, sales and production, production and raw materials, and quantity and quality. The agricultural needs plan, the industrial production plan, and the commercial sales plan were linked together to create a plan that combines production, needs, and sales. For example, the large farm tools such as threshing machines urgently needed for the autumn harvest were not originally listed as the focus of production by the industrial departments, and the sales plan formulated by the commercial departments was also somewhat conservative. After the worker, peasant and business departments bared their needs, all the management districts in the county needed a total of 2,300 threshing machines, with 1,405 originally available, and 895 needed to be purchased. These threshing machines were to be produced by the industrial departments. The workers and staff of the industrial departments felt that their responsibilities were even greater, and immediately arranged the autumn harvest tools in advance for production; the commercial departments also revised their sales plan. The county machinery factory lacked wood for producing threshing machines, and some management districts in Pingba needed bamboo for producing bamboo farm tools. The employees of the county commercial bureau and the central stores in Jihua, Guanglong, and Songyuan actively helped various factories purchase wood and bamboo and send them to various factories, so that the production units quickly put into production. In the past, some factories only cared about quantity and not quality, only cared about production and not use. After the "four-way" meeting, the heads of the county agricultural machinery factory and various commune farm tool factories led workers to nearby production teams and cadres and farmers for discussions, asking them to evaluate the specifications and quality of various farm tools, improve product quality according to the opinions of the masses, and ensure that every product manufactured, qualified, and shipped from the factory could be used, and be fully responsible from quantity to quality, from production to use.

Tools Form a Complete Set

With the deepening of the movement, in order to implement the preparation for harvesting, threshing, transporting, drying, and storing to the team and group, the party committees and departments at all levels, according to the characteristics of many autumn harvest processes and many types of tools, meticulously arranged everything from production tools to daily necessities, so that the large and small tools for each process and the daily necessities of each canteen formed a complete set. Under the unified leadership of the county party committee, the county organized three teams and three teams to rush to produce, supply, and match. In addition to insisting on production, the county and commune factories also transferred workers and iron furnaces, and the commercial departments transferred cadres to form six repair and assembly groups, which took tools and spare parts to six communes and management districts respectively to repair and assemble large and small farm tools. The workers repaired, and the commercial cadres matched, so that all kinds of large and small farm tools were available. The food and living management departments also transferred more than 60 cadres to go to key teams in various communes to work with the masses to level the drying grounds, dig drainage ditches, and build rain-proof sheds, making a model for comprehensive promotion; specific arrangements were also made for the supply of living materials. Thanks to the active work of various industries and professions, at present, more than 50% of the 2,900 threshing machines, bellows, and other large farm tools, and more than 20,000 sickles, grain baskets, and other small farm tools planned for production and repair in the county have been completed, and most of the drying grounds and warehouses have been prepared.

    深入基层调查需要　工农商协作“一条龙”
    ?江各行各业齐心协力支援秋收
    全县生产、修配的农具已完成计划一半以上，晒场、仓库大部准备好
    据云南日报消息　云南?江县开展了一个各行各业支援秋收的群众运动，积极为夺取秋粮增产增收做好准备工作。
    人人支援秋收
    ?江县夺取秋粮增产增收的一场决战即将开始。为了把秋收准备工作做得又快又好，县委派出了一位书记带领工业、商业部门的负责干部到有代表性的吉花公社作了调查研究。他们下田去看，稻谷普遍打苞抽穗；他们到队里去听，广大群众迫切要求把秋粮收好管好。社员们都说：一年辛苦靠一秋，宁肯人等谷黄，不让黄谷等人。工作组和各队干部细算了栽插面积账、收割时间账、参加秋收的劳力账以及所需的物资账，经过认真分析研究，摸索出今年的秋收具有“早、多、齐”等特点。早是稻谷成熟早，全社栽种的二万四千亩稻谷，成熟期将较去年提早十天；多是栽种面积比去年多了9％，每亩密植程度比去年多了25％，参加收割的劳力比去年增多10％；齐是大面积成熟一致，有65％的稻谷将集中在9月中、下旬收割。要争取拿到尽可能多的粮食，既要坚持九熟十收，做到快收、快打、快运、快晒、快藏；又要特别讲究收打质量，精收细打，确保颗粒还仓。按照“早、多、齐、快、好”的要求，这个公社添购的大农具需要比去年增加40％—50％，小农具需要比去年增加30％；要修补的大农具占现有农具的80％，要修补的小农具占现有农具的40％；晒场、仓库的需要量也要增加一倍左右。
    县委进一步研究了全县的情况，全县需要添购的打谷机等大农具，将比去年增加50％左右，需要添购的镰刀等小农具将比去年增加30％左右，原有的大小农具修补数量也很大；但是离开镰收割的时间只有一个来月。于是各级党组织一面分行业、分公社把全党全民广泛动员起来，全县很快就掀起了一个“人人关心秋收，人人支援秋收”的热潮。
    工农商紧密协作
    群众发动起来，急待解决的问题是怎样有领导、有计划地组织生产、组织供应，又早又快又好地满足秋收需要。县委采取一竿子到底的办法，召开了县、公社、管理区的农业、工业、商业、财经部门三级干部参加的“四摆”会议，让各级农业部门摆需要，商业部门摆库存，工业部门摆生产，财经部门摆资金，共同解决需要与制造、销售与需要、销售与生产、生产与原料、数量与质量之间所存在的一些问题，把农业的需要计划、工业的生产计划、商业的销售计划衔接起来，做出一个生产、需要、销售三者合一的计划。例如秋收急需的打谷机等大农具，原来工业部门没有列为生产重点，商业部门制订的销售计划也有些保守。工农商摆底后，全县各管理区共需打谷机二千三百部，原有一千四百零五部，需要添购八百九十五部。这些打谷机要由工业部门生产。工业部门职工越更感到自己责任重大，立即把秋收工具安排在前，提早生产；商业部门也修订了销售计划。县机械厂生产打谷机缺乏木料，平坝的一些管理区生产竹农具需要竹子，县商业局和吉花、广龙、松元等中心商店的职工，就积极帮助各厂采购木料和竹子送到各厂，使得生产单位很快投入生产。过去有的工厂只管数量不管质量，只管生产不管使用，“四摆”会后，县农业机械厂、各公社农具厂都由厂长率领工人到附近生产队和干部农民座谈，请他们鉴定各种农具的规格质量，按照群众意见提高产品质量，保证各种产品制造一件、合格一件、出厂一件、就能使用一件，从数量到质量，从生产到使用负责到底。
    工具成龙配套
    随着运动的深入开展，各级党委和各部门为了把收、打、运、晒、藏的准备落实到队到组，根据秋收工序多、工具品种多的特点，从生产工具到生活用品作了细致排队，让各道工序的大小工具和各个食堂生活用品成龙配套。全县在县委统一领导下组织了三套班子，三支队伍，突击生产、供应、配套。县、社工厂除了坚持生产外，还抽调了工人、铁炉，商业部门抽调了干部，共组成六个修配小组，带上工具和配件，分别到六个公社各管理区巡回修配大小农具，工人边修理，商业干部边配套，做到大小农具样样齐全。粮食、生活管理部门也抽调了六十多个干部，到各公社深入重点队，和群众一起动手平整晒场，开排水沟，盖防雨草棚，做出样子全面推广；生活物资供应也分别作了具体安排。由于各行各业分工分业积极进行工作，目前，全县计划生产、修配的二千九百部打谷机、风箱等大农具，二万多件镰刀、谷箩等小农具，已完成了计划的50％以上，晒场、仓库大部分已准备好。
