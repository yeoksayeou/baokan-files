    Three Films of the Vietnamese Film Week
    "Fragments of Chairman Ho Chi Minh's Revolutionary Activities"
    Nearly fifty years ago, a Vietnamese patriotic youth, in order to find a way to save the country and the people, began his revolutionary activities. This person is today's great leader of the Vietnamese people—Chairman Ho Chi Minh. The documentary "Fragments of Chairman Ho Chi Minh's Revolutionary Activities" begins with his story at the age of twenty-one. At that time, he used a pseudonym to work as a cook on a ship, traveling to various countries while engaging in revolutionary work.
    At the end of World War I, he used the Versailles Conference to carry out the struggle to save his country, and published the "Demands for Civil Rights," signed "Nguyen Ai Quoc." From then on, the name "Nguyen Ai Quoc" was closely linked to the fate of Vietnam.
    In 1941, he presided over the historic Eighth Party Congress in the Cao Bang base area, and decided to launch an armed uprising. On August 19, 1945, the whole people launched an armed uprising, and the people seized power. On September 2, Chairman Ho Chi Minh solemnly read the "Declaration of Independence" in Ba Dinh Square. On September 23, the French imperialist aggressor troops made a comeback and occupied southern Vietnam. Chairman Ho led the people of the whole country to continue to resolutely resist, and finally achieved victory. These major historical events are all reflected in the film.
    "The Same River"
    Xiao Huai and A Yun are a young engaged couple. Xiao Huai lives on the south bank of the Ben Hai River, under the reactionary rule of the Ngo Dinh Diem clique; A Yun lives on the north bank, living a happy life under the Kim Son red flag. Although they work on the same riverbank, within a short distance of each other, they live in two completely different worlds because the US-Ngo reactionaries are hindering the reunification of Vietnam.
    Originally, according to the Geneva Accords, the people on both sides of the Ben Hai River could travel freely. However, the Ngo Dinh Diem clique often arbitrarily violated this agreement. Just as Xiao Huai and A Yun were scheduled to get married, the South Bank authorities suddenly blockaded the river, destroying this happy marriage.
    After the reactionaries violated the Geneva Accords, they launched another anti-communist high tide. However, all their reactionary acts further angered the people on the South Bank, and the agents sent to the North Bank were also exposed. The fighting enthusiasm of the people on both sides of the river is even higher. With the help of the villagers, Xiao Huai finally came to the North Bank and met A Yun. However, there are still more couples, fathers and sons, brothers... separated on both sides of the river. The people on the South Bank are still living in the dire straits of reactionary rule.
    As long as Vietnam is not unified, the struggle of the Vietnamese people will not stop for a day!
    Documentary "Bac Hung Hai"
    "Bac Hung Hai to Bac Hung Hai, nine years out of ten are drought"; "Three days of rain and the land floods, three days of sunshine and the land is scorched." These tearful words illustrate the deep suffering of the people in the Bac Hung Hai area of Vietnam, who were unable to resist natural disasters under feudalism and colonialism. The Vietnamese Labor Party and the Democratic Government understood this and decided to build the Bac Hung Hai irrigation system to improve the living conditions for more than one million people in the disaster area.
    The film "Bac Hung Hai" reports on the construction of this great project, describes the heroic people working on the construction site in their thousands, and also records the leaders of the Vietnamese Party and Government and brothers from socialist countries participating in the labor.

    越南电影周的三部影片
    《胡志明主席革命活动片断》
    将近五十年以前，有一位越南的爱国青年，为了找到一条救国救民的道路，开始了他的革命活动。这个人就是今天越南人民的伟大领袖——胡志明主席。纪录片《胡志明主席革命活动片断》就是从他二十一岁时开始叙述。那时候他化名在船上当伙夫，一面旅行各国，一面从事革命工作。
    第一次世界大战结束时，他利用凡尔赛会议进行挽救祖国的斗争，发表了民权要求书。署名“阮爱国”。从此“阮爱国”的名字就和越南的命运紧紧结合在一起。
    1941年，他在高平根据地主持了具有历史意义的党的第八次会议，决定武装起义。1945年8月19日，全民武装起义，人民夺取了政权。9月2日，胡志明主席在巴亭广场上庄严地宣读了“独立宣言”。9月23日，法国帝国主义侵略军卷土重来，侵占了越南南部，胡主席领导全国人民，继续坚决抵抗，终于取得了胜利。这些重大的历史事件，都在影片里得到了反映。
    《同一条江》
    小怀和阿运是一对年青的未婚夫妻。小怀住在边海江南岸，处于吴庭艳集团反动统治之下；阿运住在北岸，在金星红旗下过着幸福的生活。虽然他们在同一条江边劳动，相距咫尺，由于美吴反动派阻碍越南的统一，他们却生活在两个截然不同的世界里。
  本来根据日内瓦协定，边海江两岸的人民是可以自由来往的。可是吴庭艳集团经常随心所欲地破坏这个协定。正当小怀和阿运预定结婚的那天，南岸当局突然封锁了江面，破坏了这桩美满婚姻。
    反动派破坏了日内瓦协定以后，又掀起了一个反共高潮。可是他们的一切反动勾当，更加激怒了南岸人民，而派到北岸的特务也被破获了。两岸人民的斗争热情更加高涨了。小怀在乡亲们的帮助之下，终于来到了北岸，和阿运见面了。但是，还有更多的夫妻、父子、兄弟……被分隔在两岸。南岸人民还生活在反动统治的水深火热之中。
    越南一天不统一，越南人民的斗争一天不停止！
    纪录片《北兴海》
  “北兴海来北兴海，十年倒有九年旱”；“三天下雨地就涝，三天日晒地就焦”。这些包含眼泪的话，说明了越南北兴海地区的人民，在封建主义和殖民主义统治下，无力抗拒自然灾害的深重苦难。越南劳动党和民主政府了解这一点，决定修建北兴海灌溉系统，为一百多万灾区人民改善生活条件。
    影片《北兴海》报道了建筑这个伟大工程的情况，描述了成千上万在工地上劳动的英雄人民，还纪录了越南党和政府的领袖以及来自社会主义各国的弟兄们参加劳动的情景。
