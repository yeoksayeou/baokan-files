    In many areas, natural disasters are still fighting against us. The people's communes neither ignore nor fear natural disasters. Strong winds, torrential rains, floods, waterlogging, droughts, and pests cannot break the strong will of millions of people to engage in agriculture and produce grain in a big way.

    "What is lost in the early autumn should be found in the late autumn," "What is lost in the paddy fields should be found in the dry fields," "What is lost in the grain fields should be found in the vegetable gardens" – these are all correct slogans. At the same time, we cannot ignore "where it is lost, first look there to find it": prop up what has fallen, irrigate what lacks water, drain what is flooded, and rush to harvest what is ripe. After the disaster in Dengji Commune, Heze, Shandong, the first thing they did was to rescue food crops, rush to plant late autumn crops and vegetables; and then engage in sideline production on a large scale in the autumn. This arrangement distinguishes between the important and the urgent, and grasps the "major issues." Some places are now proposing "what is lost in agriculture should be found in sideline production," which is premature. Disaster areas should still put the large-scale development of agriculture and grain production first. Under no circumstances can this be shaken.

### 地里丢的先从地里找

    地里丢的先从地里找
    在不少地区，自然灾害仍然在与我们作对。人民公社是既不忽视自然灾害，也不害怕自然灾害。狂风、暴雨、洪水、内涝、干旱、病虫，都摧折不了千百万人民大办农业、大办粮食的坚强意志。
    “早秋丢了从晚秋里找”，“水田丢了从旱田里找”，“粮田丢了从菜地里找”，这些都是正确的口号。同时，也不可忽视“哪里丢的先从哪里找”：倒了的扶起来，断水的灌上水，水淹的排水，熟了的抢收。山东菏泽邓集公社受灾后首先抢救粮食作物，抢种晚秋和蔬菜；到秋后再大搞副业生产。这样安排，就分清了轻重缓急，抓住了“大头”。有的地方现在就提出了“农业丢了从副业里找”，这就为时过早。受灾地区，同样要把大办农业、大办粮食放在第一位。在任何情况下，这一点都不可动摇。
