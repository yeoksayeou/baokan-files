Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, September 19th: Workers in iron smelting, coking, transportation, and machinery departments in Suzhou City are carrying out a "one-stop" collaborative competition to support the sustained leap forward in steel production.

　　In the one-stop competition centered on steelmaking, workers in the coking workshop of Suzhou Iron and Steel Plant innovated coking oven equipment, strictly implemented the system of eating cleanly and well, and strictly observed operating procedures such as frequent pipe cleaning and uniform coke output, improving the yield and quality of coke. Since entering September, the daily output of simple No. 2 coke oven has increased by 20% compared with the average of last month. The increased coke produced by this workshop not only met the needs of the factory but also supported the production of other steel plants in the city. Workers at the Suzhou Coking Plant actively expanded coke sources, strengthened coal blending, and made full use of peat for coking. Since September, the factory has produced more than 400 tons of good coke using non-coking coal and peat.

　　Blast furnace workers in various iron smelting plants also worked hard to produce good iron to supply converters for steelmaking. Workers in the silicon iron workshop of Suzhou Grinding Wheel Factory adopted measures such as carefully selecting raw materials and strengthening equipment maintenance, increasing the daily output of silicon iron by 17.8% since September compared to August.

　　In order to strengthen the transportation capacity of steel plants, the shipping company dispatched a large number of ships to meet the needs of steelmaking. Workers at the loading and unloading station and transportation station of the Xujiang Iron and Steel Plant Wharf also coordinated their actions, widely using advanced machinery such as electric lifting levers, increasing the daily transportation volume from more than 200 tons to more than 400 tons, meeting the needs of converters and blast furnaces.

　　With the cooperation and support of all parties, workers in various steel plants have also launched more enthusiastic team competitions to catch up with each other. Workers at Suzhou Iron and Steel Plant learned from the experience of the No. 1 pig iron furnace of Shanghai Steel Plant No. 3 in carrying out communist collaboration, actively improved operating techniques, strengthened the collaboration of various processes, extended furnace life and accelerated furnace repair progress, achieving continuous blowing; since the beginning of September, the daily output of steel has increased by 1.3 times compared with the same period in August, and the qualification rate has reached 91.78%.

    炼铁、炼焦、运输、机械等部门齐心为钢铁
    苏州开展“一条龙”协作竞赛
    据新华社南京19日电　苏州市各炼铁、炼焦、运输和机械等部门的职工开展“一条龙”大协作竞赛，支援炼钢生产持续跃进。
    在以炼钢为中心的一条龙竞赛中，苏州钢铁厂焦化车间职工革新焦炉设备，严格执行吃干、吃好的制度，并且严格遵守勤通管道、均匀出焦等操作规程，提高了焦炭的产量和质量。进入9月以来，简易二号焦窑的日产量比上月平均提高了20％。这个车间增产的焦炭不仅供应了本厂的需要，还支援了市内其他钢铁厂的生产。苏州焦化厂职工积极扩大焦源，加强配煤工作，充分利用泥煤炼焦。9月份以来，这个厂用不结焦的煤和泥煤炼出的好焦就达四百多吨。
    各炼铁厂的高炉工人也努力炼好铁供应转炉炼钢。苏州砂轮厂矽铁车间工人采用精选原料和加强设备维护等措施，9月份以来使矽铁的日产量比8月份提高了17.8％。
    为了加强钢铁厂的运输力量，航运公司调度了大批船只，来适应炼钢的需要。胥江钢铁厂码头的装卸站、运输站工人，还协同动作，广泛使用电动吊杠等先进机具，使每天的运输量从二百多吨提高到四百多吨，满足了转炉和高炉的需要。
    在各方面的协作和支援下，各炼钢厂的职工也更加热烈地展开了你追我赶的班组竞赛。苏州钢铁厂工人学习了上钢三厂一号化铁炉开展共产主义大协作的经验，积极改进操作技术，加强各道工序的协作，延长炉龄和加快修炉进度，做到了连续吹炼；9月上旬以来，钢的日产量比8月同期增长了一点三倍，合格率达到91.78％。
