Xinhua News Agency, 26th. Josef Sedivy, the newly appointed Ambassador of the Czechoslovak Socialist Republic to China, accompanied by officials from the embassy, presented his credentials to Chairman Liu Shaoqi this evening.

In his reply, Chairman Liu Shaoqi congratulated the Czechoslovak people on the great achievements they have made in all aspects of socialist construction. He said that the development of friendly and cooperative relations between China and Czechoslovakia, based on the principles of Marxism-Leninism, will further consolidate the great unity of the socialist camp and benefit the just cause of safeguarding world peace.

Chairman Liu Shaoqi said that in the fifteen years since liberation, under the leadership of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia, the Czechoslovak people have made great achievements in all aspects of socialist construction. The Chinese people are sincerely happy about these achievements of the Czechoslovak people. Like the achievements of the people of other fraternal countries, every achievement of the fraternal Czechoslovak people will strengthen the power of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union and benefit the cause of world peace and human progress. We wish the Czechoslovak people new and even more brilliant achievements in the upcoming Third Five-Year Plan, based on the successful completion of the Second Five-Year Plan this year.

Chairman Liu said that the people of China and Czechoslovakia have a long-standing friendship. Since the founding of the People's Republic of China, the friendly and cooperative relations between our two countries have entered a new historical period. Over the past eleven years, China and Czechoslovakia have established extensive and close friendly cooperative relations in the fields of politics, economy, culture, science and technology. The people of the two countries have consistently helped and supported each other in the just cause of building socialism and safeguarding world peace. The Chinese government and people cherish the close friendly cooperative relations established between China and Czechoslovakia over the past eleven years and express their sincere gratitude for the support and assistance of the Czechoslovak government and people. We believe that with the continuous development of socialist construction and the friendship between the two peoples, the friendly and cooperative relations between China and Czechoslovakia will be further developed and strengthened on the basis of Marxism-Leninism and the principle of proletarian internationalism.

In his speech, Ambassador Josef Sedivy said that the Czechoslovak people have always followed the heroic revolutionary struggle of the Chinese people with the spirit of proletarian solidarity and great sympathy. Under the influence of the world-historic victory of the Great October Socialist Revolution, the Chinese people, under the banner of the Communist Party of China, fought against foreign imperialism and the traitors of their own people for their own beautiful lives and a new social system. Therefore, our people, like all working people around the world, greeted the historic victory of the Chinese people and the establishment of the People's Republic of China with infinite joy; we will soon celebrate its eleventh anniversary. At the same time, the people of all nationalities in Czechoslovakia are delighted to highly appreciate the remarkable and brilliant achievements made by the People's Republic of China and its working people in socialist construction since the founding of the People's Republic of China under the leadership of their glorious Communist Party of China with diligent and selfless labor.

The Ambassador said that the liberation of the Czechoslovak Socialist Republic by the glorious Soviet army in May 1945, the victory of the Czechoslovak working people over the domestic reactionaries under the leadership of their beloved Communist Party of Czechoslovakia in February 1948, and the establishment of the People's Republic of China, laid the preconditions for establishing, developing and deepening comprehensive comradely cooperation between our countries. This cooperation is in line with the deep friendly feelings of the Czechoslovak and Chinese people. This extensive friendly cooperation is firmly based on the doctrine of Marxism-Leninism and the principle of proletarian internationalism. This is the cooperation between two brotherly countries, which are members of the powerful socialist camp led by the Soviet Union, and they are determined to jointly promote the further strengthening and deepening of the unbreakable unity of the entire socialist camp and the consolidation of world peace.

The Ambassador said that the government and people of the Czechoslovak Socialist Republic fully support the struggle of the People's Republic of China to win recognition of its legitimate rights in international organizations, the struggle against imperialism, especially the United States' conspiracy on the so-called "two Chinas" issue, and the efforts to resolve the issue of liberating Taiwan, an integral part of the People's Republic of China.

The Ambassador said that we can happily point out that we have already achieved considerable success in developing and consolidating political, economic and cultural relations between our two countries. I believe that we have all the prerequisites to further deepen mutual cooperation in all aspects, first of all, to develop economic relations, and the current achievements should become an inspiration for both parties to continue to promote this development. This fruitful cooperation between our two countries not only benefits the people of our two countries, but also contributes to the unity of socialist countries as a guarantee of the victory of socialism and peace in the world.

Present at the presentation of credentials were Luo Guibo, Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs, Yu Zhan, Deputy Director of the Department of Soviet and European Affairs of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and Ge Buhai, Deputy Director of the Protocol Department. (Attached photo)

    捷克斯洛伐克新任驻华大使向刘主席递交国书
    新华社26日讯　捷克斯洛伐克社会主义共和国新任驻华大使约瑟夫·赛迪维今晚偕同大使馆官员向刘少奇主席递交国书。
    刘少奇主席在致答词时，祝贺捷克斯洛伐克人民在社会主义建设事业各方面所取得的巨大成就，他说，中捷两国建立在马克思列宁主义原则基础上的友好合作关系的发展，将进一步巩固社会主义阵营的伟大团结和有利于维护世界和平的正义事业。
    刘少奇主席说，解放十五年来，捷克斯洛伐克人民在捷克斯洛伐克共产党的领导下，在社会主义建设事业的各方面都取得了巨大的成就。中国人民对捷克斯洛伐克人民取得的这些成就感到由衷的高兴。如同其他兄弟国家人民取得的成就一样，兄弟的捷克斯洛伐克人民取得的每一个成就，都将增强以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的力量和有利于世界和平及人类进步事业。我们预祝捷克斯洛伐克人民在今年胜利完成第二个五年计划的基础上，在即将开始的第三个五年计划期间，取得新的更加辉煌的成就。
    刘主席说，中捷两国人民有着悠久的友谊，自中华人民共和国成立以来，我们两国间的友好合作关系就进入了一个崭新的历史时期。过去十一年来，中捷两国在政治、经济、文化以及科学技术等方面都建立起了广泛、亲密的友好合作关系。两国人民在建设社会主义和维护世界和平的正义事业中，一贯是互相帮助和互相支持。中国政府和人民十分珍视过去十一年来中捷两国间所建立起来的亲密友好合作关系，并对捷克斯洛伐克政府和人民的支持和帮助，表示衷心的感谢。我们相信，随着两国社会主义建设事业和两国人民友谊的不断发展，中捷两国的友好合作关系，将在马克思列宁主义和无产阶级国际主义原则的基础上获得进一步的发展和增强。
    约瑟夫·赛迪维大使在致颂词时说，捷克斯洛伐克人民一向怀着以无产阶级的团结精神和巨大的同情关注了中国人民的英勇的革命斗争。中国人民在伟大的十月社会主义革命世界历史性胜利的影响下，在中国共产党的旗帜下为反对外国帝国主义和本国人民的叛徒，为争取自己美好生活和新的社会制度进行了斗争。因此，我国人民如同全世界所有劳动人民一样，以无限愉快的心情迎接了中国人民历史性的胜利和中华人民共和国的建立；最近我们将要庆祝它的建国十一周年。同时，捷克斯洛伐克各族人民怀着愉快的心情，高度评价中华人民共和国及其劳动人民自中华人民共和国成立以来，在自己光荣的中国共产党的领导下，以勤劳忘我的劳动在社会主义建设中所取得的卓越和光辉的成就。
    大使说，1945年5月光荣的苏联军队对捷克斯洛伐克社会主义共和国的解放和1948年2月捷劳动人民在自己亲爱的捷克斯洛伐克共产党领导下对国内反动派的胜利以及中华人民共和国的建立就为在我们国家间建立、发展和加深全面的同志般的合作建立了前提，这种合作符合于捷克斯洛伐克人民和中国人民深厚的友好感情。这种广泛的友好合作巩固地建立在马克思列宁主义学说和无产阶级国际主义原则之上。这是两个兄弟国家间的合作，它们是以苏联为领导的强大的社会主义阵营中的成员，它们决心共同来促进整个社会主义阵营牢不可破的团结的进一步的加强和增深以及世界和平的巩固。
    大使说，捷克斯洛伐克社会主义共和国政府和人民完全支持中华人民共和国为争取在国际组织中承认其合法权利的斗争，为反对帝国主义，特别是美国在所谓“两个中国”问题上的阴谋的斗争，和为解决解放中华人民共和国不可分割的一部分——台湾问题所作的努力。
    大使说，我们可以高兴地指出，我们两国在发展和巩固政治、经济和文化关系方面已经取得了不小的成就。我相信，我们具有一切前提来进一步加深在所有方面的相互合作，首先是发展经济关系，而目前的成就应成为双方继续促进这种发展的鼓舞。我们两国的这种富有成效的合作不仅造福于我们两国人民，而且有助于作为在社会主义和和平在世界上胜利的保证的社会主义各国的团结。
