Let Women Cadres Grow Faster
	Yao Di

	Since the Great Leap Forward, especially since the people's commune movement, the broad masses of urban and rural women across the country have left their homes to participate in various forms of productive labor. Particularly in rural areas, the vast majority of women with labor power have投入 themselves into the various forms of productive labor of the people's communes, becoming a main force on the agricultural production front.

	Faced with this situation, the large-scale cultivation and promotion of women cadres has become an important task for leading organs. In order to further unleash the enormous role of women in production, it is not only necessary to strengthen the political leadership and ideological education of women, but also to better help women solve a series of practical problems after participating in production, such as household chores, cultural learning, and labor protection. And women cadres are precisely the backbone that leads the broad masses of women forward, and the best bridge and link between the Party and the women masses. For example, in Huai'an County, Jiangsu, there were very few women cadres at the commune and brigade levels in the past. Some female commune members reflected: "We women have many soldiers but few generals, and some problems cannot be solved by male cadres." After the county party committee promoted a group of women cadres this year, those female commune members said: "With female generals leading female soldiers, women are charging forward in production." This profoundly reflects the feelings of love and support of the broad masses of women for women cadres, and at the same time illustrates the important role of women cadres in leading production.

	Not only that, the large-scale cultivation and promotion of women cadres is also an important measure to expand the Party's cadre ranks. With the development of socialist construction, it is necessary to continuously replenish and increase new leadership backbone in all aspects of work. And women, who account for half of the population, are an important source of this new leadership power.

	The large-scale cultivation and promotion of women cadres not only has an urgent need at present, but also has fully favorable conditions. Facts have proved that after the broad masses of rural women have投入 themselves into collective labor, their horizons have been broadened, their socialist and communist consciousness has been raised, and their intelligence and talents have been better brought into play. Thousands upon thousands of women red banner bearers and ingenious girls have emerged throughout the country. They wholeheartedly listen to the Party, do not impose conditions in labor, dare to overcome difficulties, maintain close ties with the masses, and have a certain organizational ability and production skills. Therefore, they have a high prestige among the masses and have actually become a powerful leading backbone force of the Party. As long as the leading organs attach importance to this in their thinking, boldly let go, and enthusiastically and patiently help them further improve their political awareness and working ability, they will certainly be able to cultivate and promote a large number of women cadres. Yan'an Prefecture, due to its emphasis on and focus on selecting outstanding women to take on leadership positions, has achieved the goal of having female county heads in every county, female commune heads in every commune, and female team leaders in every team since May of this year. As a result, the production enthusiasm of the broad masses of women has been further unleashed, and the leadership of the front line of production has been greatly strengthened. The experience of Yan'an Prefecture in this regard is well worth the attention of other regions.

	Of course, the work of cultivating and promoting women cadres is by no means a temporary crash task, but a regular work. For women cadres who have been selected to take on leadership positions at all levels, the leading organs cannot let them drift along. They should earnestly strengthen their education and assistance, especially by organizing them to study in a planned way, to further cultivate and improve their political awareness and practical working ability. The Yan'an Prefecture's organization of women cadre training classes, the rotation of training of women cadres, or the adoption of the method of county heads leading commune heads, commune heads leading team leaders, and layer-by-layer specific assistance and training have all proven to be effective. Other regions have also created many good methods, which need to be summarized and promoted.

	The women of New China are growing rapidly. Now, women have "held up half the sky in production." There is no doubt that under the Party's cultivation and education, they will certainly be able to better "hold up half the sky!" in leading and organizing production.

    让妇女干部更快地成长起来	姚堤
    大跃进以来，特别是人民公社化以来，全国广大城乡妇女走出家门参加了各种生产劳动，特别是在农村，绝大部分有劳动力的妇女都投入了人民公社的各种生产劳动，成为农业生产战线上的一支主力军。
    面对这种形势，大量培养和提拔妇女干部就成为领导机关的一项重要任务。为了进一步发挥妇女在生产中的巨大作用，不但必须加强对妇女的政治领导和思想教育，而且必须更好地帮助妇女解决参加生产以后的家务操作、文化学习、劳动保护等一系列具体问题。而妇女干部，正是带动广大妇女群众前进的骨干，是党联系妇女群众的最好的桥梁和纽带。例如在江苏淮安县，过去公社和大队一级很少妇女干部，有些女社员反映：“我们妇女兵多将少，有些问题男干部解决不了。”在今年县委提拔了一批妇女干部以后，那些女社员就说：“有了女将带女兵，妇女生产打冲锋。”这深刻地反映了广大妇女群众对妇女干部爱戴拥护的心情，同时也说明了妇女干部在领导生产中的重要作用。
    不但如此，大量培养和提拔妇女干部还是扩大党的干部队伍的一个重要措施。随着社会主义建设的发展，在各项工作中都需要不断地补充和增加新的领导骨干。而占人口一半的妇女，就是提供这种新的领导力量的一个重要泉源。
    大量培养和提拔妇女干部，在当前不仅有着迫切的需要，而且也有着充分的有利条件。事实证明，广大农村妇女投入集体劳动以后，她们的眼界开阔了，社会主义、共产主义觉悟提高了，她们的聪明才智更好地发挥出来了。全国各地都出现了成千上万的妇女红旗手和巧姑娘，她们一心一意听党的话，在劳动中不讲条件，勇于克服困难，密切联系群众，并且具有一定的组织能力和生产技能，因而在群众中有很高的威信，实际上已经成为党的一支有力的领导骨干力量。只要领导机关思想重视，大胆放手，而又热情耐心地帮助她们进一步提高政治觉悟和工作能力，就一定能够培养和提拔大批妇女干部。延安专区由于重视和抓紧选拔优秀妇女担任领导工作，今年5月开始到现在，已经做到县县有女县长，社社有女社长，队队有女队长，因而进一步发挥了广大妇女群众的生产积极性，大大地加强了生产第一线的领导。延安专区这方面的经验，很值得其它地区重视。
    当然，培养和提拔妇女干部的工作决不是一件临时突击任务，而是一项经常的工作。对于已被选拔担任各级领导工作的妇女干部，领导机关不能听其自流，应该切实加强对她们的教育和帮助，尤其是要有计划地组织她们学习，进一步培养和提高她们的政治觉悟和实际工作能力。延安专区组织妇女干部训练班，轮流培训妇女干部，或者采用县长带社长、社长带队长，层层具体帮助培养的办法，都证明是有效的。其它地区也已经创造了不少好办法，需要加以总结和推广。
    新中国的妇女正在迅速地成长着。现在，妇女已经“顶住生产半边天”。毫无疑问，在党的培养和教育下，她们在领导和组织生产的岗位上，必定能够更好地“顶住半边天！”
