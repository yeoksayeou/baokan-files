Zhou Benrong – A Good Commander of the Coal Mining Team
He constantly educated his team members to raise their ideological awareness, leading the entire group to work selflessly for the cause of communism, achieving monthly overproduction and daily safety. The Guangdong Provincial Department of Fuel Industry and the Coal Miners' Union have designated their team as a model for coal miners throughout the province.

(Reported from Guangzhou, September 7) Zhou Benrong, a coal miner from the Quren Coal Mine in Guangdong Province who attended the National Congress of Heroes in 1959, and the team he leads, have continued to make great leaps forward on the basis of the great leap forward in 1958 and 1959. Since the beginning of this year, they have overfulfilled their production plans every month, maintained safe production every day, and successfully completed the production tasks assigned to them by the Party. To commend their outstanding production achievements and promote their advanced experiences, the Guangdong Provincial Department of Fuel Industry and the Guangdong Provincial Coal Miners' Union recently decided to establish the Zhou Benrong team as a model for coal miners throughout the province, calling on workers in all coal mines throughout the province to learn from the spirit of Zhou Benrong's team in working selflessly for the cause of communism with utmost loyalty; to learn from their advanced experience of monthly overproduction and daily safety; to learn from their communist style of unity and mutual assistance, learning from the advanced and helping the backward; and to learn from their heroic character of not bowing their heads in the face of difficulties and not being arrogant in the face of victory.

The Zhou Benrong team is a coal mining team from the Quren Coal Mine, one of the four major coal mines in Guangdong Province. Since its establishment in October 1958, this team has consistently maintained a strong revolutionary fighting spirit, overfulfilling the production plans assigned by the state every year and every month. In 1959, they completed the annual production task thirty-seven days ahead of schedule, and in the first half of this year, they completed the production task for the first half of the year twenty-six days ahead of schedule. Currently, each person in the team mines an average of more than five tons of coal per day, with a maximum of 7.8 tons, creating a record for high yield in manual coal mining in the province. At the same time, this team has maintained safe production for twenty-two consecutive months. In the technical innovation and technical revolution movements, they have proposed more than eighty rationalization proposals, overcome many key production problems, and created advanced coal mining methods such as the automatic pressure mining method, which has increased work efficiency by one to several times.

      Constantly Working on People's Minds
The Party Committee of Quren Coal Mine summarized the advanced experience of the Zhou Benrong team. The most important point is to adhere to putting politics in command and constantly improve the ideological awareness of the team members. Zhou Benrong is a Communist Party member. Under the education and cultivation of the Party, he was promoted from an ordinary miner to team leader and became a national model worker. He grew up in a poor peasant family, started as a cowherd at the age of nine, and later worked as an apprentice, farmer, and miner. In the old society, he suffered all kinds of oppression and exploitation from landlords and capitalists, and ate grass roots and tree bark. Most of the members of his team also came from poor peasant backgrounds. Based on this characteristic, Zhou Benrong often used the method of recollection and comparison to enlighten the class consciousness of the team members, and often introduced to them the beautiful prospects of the development of China's coal industry, as well as the glorious responsibilities of miners in socialist construction, so that the team members could often compare the past and look forward to the future, arousing increasingly high enthusiasm for building socialism.

Many of the new miners in this team were farmers who had just put down their hoes. Moving from agriculture to industry, from the plains to the mines, and from the ground to underground, they were somewhat unaccustomed. Some people were not used to the earth-shattering explosions and the dark, rugged roadways. Therefore, some people were not at ease as miners. Based on this situation, Zhou Benrong told the new workers about his feelings when he first came to the mine, stabilizing their emotions, and patiently taught them production techniques and safety knowledge, encouraging them to aspire to be excellent miners. Zhou Benrong also paid special attention to the new workers in their lives, making them feel the warmth of the mine. Many new miners said: "At first, it was indeed a little unaccustomed, but under the meticulous care of the team leader and the enthusiastic help of the old team members, a feeling of love for the mine naturally arose. In the end, we were determined to make the mine our home and work for it for the rest of our lives."
Because Zhou Benrong always paid attention to improving the ideological awareness of the team members, the old workers in this team maintained their soaring enthusiasm, and the new workers were also full of enthusiasm and actively studied technology. Most of them could operate independently in about three months. In their mining area, many people praised the new workers of the Zhou Benrong team for making rapid progress, saying that they are: "Understand in one month, master in two months, become a skilled worker in three months, become a versatile worker in four months, and new workers become old miners in five months." Zhou Benrong also paid attention to training old workers. Since the end of 1958, more than ten old workers from their team have been transferred to be team leaders, section chiefs, and dispatchers.

Ahead Rather Than Behind, Grasp the Beginning Tightly
Another important experience of the Zhou Benrong team is: ahead rather than behind, grasp the beginning tightly. Since its establishment, this team has consistently adhered to grasping the first month of the quarter, catching up in the first ten days of the month, and catching up in the first shift of the day. Whenever the quarterly and monthly production plans are issued, they first convene a meeting of all team members for full discussion and formulate specific measures to ensure the completion of the plan. In daily production, they strive to achieve high production in the first shift, the second shift surpasses the first shift, and the third shift takes responsibility for a shock overproduction. As a result of this arrangement, the daily plans are well implemented. One shift catches up with the next, and one shift exceeds the other. There will be no phenomenon of being loose in the front and tight in the back. For example, in the second quarter of this year, they always completed more than 34% of the monthly plan in the first ten days of each month. In this way, after catching up in the middle ten days and making a shock overproduction in the last ten days, it is guaranteed that the production tasks are overfulfilled every ten days, every month, and every quarter, and preparations can be made for the next step of production.

Persist in Carrying Out Competitions
Carrying out socialist labor competitions is an important activity of the Zhou Benrong team every day. The workers chase each other every day, year after year, without interruption. Their team has a competition platform, where the daily completion of tasks by each shift is announced for mutual evaluation. In addition to the competition between shifts within the team, they also often challenge other teams to carry out competitions, and help each other in the competition. In the August great battle for increasing coal production, they and the relatively backward Kang Lianxing team in the same work section carried out a rival competition. When they found that the Kang Lianxing team had tried their best but still could not catch up with them, they took the initiative to send two veteran technicians to help the workers of the Kang Lianxing team improve their production level. Within their own team, they encouraged everyone not to be complacent, but to make further leaps and create higher production records. Through this competition of learning, comparing, catching up, and helping, the output of the three coal mining teams in the work section where the Zhou Benrong team is located has increased significantly, and the production plan has been overfulfilled for several consecutive months.

Now, on the coal industry front in Guangdong Province, a surge of "learning from the Zhou Benrong team and catching up with the Zhou Benrong team" is being set off.

    周本荣——采煤小组的好指挥员
    他不断教育组员提高思想觉悟，带动全组工人为共产主义事业而忘我地劳动，作到了月月超产，日日安全。广东省燃料工业厅和煤矿工会已把他们小组确定为全省采煤工人的标兵。
    本报广州7日电1959年曾出席全国群英会的广东省曲仁煤矿采煤工人周本荣和他领导的小组，在1958、1959两年连续大跃进的基础上，今年以来，月月超额完成生产计划，日日安全生产，出色地完成了党交给他们的生产任务。为了表扬他们卓越的生产成绩，推广他们的先进经验，最近，广东省燃料工业厅、广东省煤矿工会决定树立周本荣小组为全省采煤工人的标兵，号召全省各个煤矿的工人学习周本荣小组忠心耿耿为共产主义事业而忘我劳动的精神；学习他们月月超产、日日安全的先进经验；学习他们团结互助，见先进就学，见后进就帮的共产主义风格；学习他们在困难面前不低头，在胜利面前不骄傲的英雄本色。
    周本荣小组，是广东省四大煤矿之一的曲仁煤矿的一个采煤小组。这个小组从1958年10月成立到现在，一贯保持旺盛的革命斗志，年年月月超额完成国家下达的生产计划。1959年他们提前三十七天完成全年的生产任务，今年上半年又提前二十六天完成了上半年的生产任务。现在，全组每人每天平均采煤五吨多，最高达到七点八吨，创造了全省手工回采的高产纪录。同时，这个组已经连续安全生产二十二个月。在技术革新和技术革命运动中，他们提出过八十多项合理化建议，攻克了不少生产关键，创造了自动压力回采法等先进的采煤方法，使工效提高一倍到几倍。
      时时刻刻作人的工作
    曲仁煤矿党委会总结了周本荣小组的先进经验。其中最主要的一条是坚持政治挂帅，不断提高组员的思想觉悟。周本荣是一个共产党员。在党的教育培养下，他从一个普通的矿工被提拔为组长，并且成为全国的劳动模范。他是在一个贫苦的农民家庭里长大的，九岁开始当牧童，后来当过徒工、农民和矿工。在旧社会里，他受尽地主和资本家的压迫剥削，吃过草根、树皮。他小组的成员大多数也是贫苦农民出身。周本荣根据这一特点，经常运用回忆对比的办法，启发组员们的阶级觉悟，并常常向他们介绍我国煤炭工业发展的美好远景，以及矿工在社会主义建设中的光荣职责，使组员们能够经常对比过去，展望将来，激发起越来越高的建设社会主义的热情。
    这个组新来的矿工很多都是刚放下锄头的农民，从农业转到工业，从平原转到矿山，从地面转到井下，多少总有些不习惯。有些人初来时，听不惯地动山摇的爆炸声，走不惯黑洞洞、崎岖不平的巷道。因此，有的人对当矿工不够安心。周本荣根据这种情况，便把自己初来矿山时的心情讲给新来的工人们听，安定他们的情绪，同时耐心地教他们掌握生产技术和安全知识，鼓励他们立志当一名出色的矿工。周本荣还在生活上特别关心新工人，使他们感到矿山的温暖。不少新矿工说：初来时的确有点不习惯，但是在组长无微不至的关怀和老组员热情的帮助下，一种热爱矿山的感情就自然而然地产生出来。最后就决心以矿为家，干它一辈子。
  由于周本荣时刻注意提高组员的思想觉悟，因而在这个小组里，老工人长年保持着冲天的干劲，新工人也情绪饱满，积极钻研技术，大多数三个月左右就能单独操作。在他们矿区里，许多人都称赞周本荣小组的新工人进步快，说他们是：“一月懂，两月通，三月是个熟练工，四月成为多面手，五月新工人变老矿工。”周本荣也很注意培养老工人。从1958年底到现在，从他们组里调出去当小组长、工段长、调度员的老工人就有十多人。
    赶前不赶后　紧紧抓开头
    周本荣小组另一条重要的经验是：赶前不赶后，紧紧抓开头。这个组从成立到现在，一贯坚持了一季抓头月，一月赶上旬，一日赶头班。每当季度和月度的生产计划下达时，他们就先召开全体组员会议，进行充分讨论，订出保证完成计划的具体措施。在每天的生产中，他们都争取实现第一班高产，第二班超第一班，第三班就包突击超产。这样安排的结果，每天的计划都很落实，一班赶一班，一班超一班，不会发生前松后紧的现象。例如今年第二季度，每个月的上旬，他们总是完成月计划的34％以上。这样，经过中旬赶上旬，下旬突击超产，便保证了旬旬、月月、季季超额完成生产任务，并且能够为下一步的生产作好准备。
  坚持开展竞赛
    开展社会主义劳动竞赛，是周本荣小组每天的重要活动内容。工人们天天你追我赶，终年累月从不间断。他们小组设有一个比武台，每天各班完成任务的情况都在这里公布，互相进行评比。除了组内班与班之间的竞赛以外，他们还常常向别的组挑战，开展竞赛，并在竞赛中又赛又帮。在8月份增产煤炭的大会战中，他们和同工段比较落后的康连兴小组开展了对手赛。当他们发现康连兴小组尽了最大努力还赶不上自己的时候，就主动派了两个老技工去帮助康连兴小组的工人提高生产水平。在自己组内，便勉励大家不要自满，要跃进再跃进，创造更高的生产纪录。通过这种学、比、赶、帮的竞赛，周本荣小组所在的工段，三个采煤小组的产量都显著提高，连续几个月超额完成了生产计划。
    现在，广东全省煤炭工业战线，正在掀起一个“学周本荣小组，赶周本荣小组”的热潮。
