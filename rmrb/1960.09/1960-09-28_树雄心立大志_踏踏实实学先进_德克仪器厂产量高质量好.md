Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 27th: The Shenyang De Ke Instrument Factory, despite having inferior technical strength and equipment conditions, is determined to "learn from, catch up with, and surpass" the Shanghai Universe Balance Factory, whose production level is several times higher than its own. Through solid work and hard struggle, they cleverly overcame the three obstacles of personnel, equipment, and materials, achieving a comprehensive leap forward in production. This factory, which had previously completed its annual production plan forty days ahead of schedule last year, completed this year's state plan as early as May 24. By September 19, the factory's product output exceeded this year's state plan target by 33.4%, and it manufactured 255 units of products outside the plan—pan balances and industrial balances. The quality pass rate increased by 1% compared to the plan, the cost decreased by 26.4%, and the profit turned over exceeded 289%. Compared with the same period last year, output increased by 79%. In the past, the balances produced by this factory could only reflect a weight of one ten-thousandth of a gram, but now the balances they produce can reflect a weight of one hundred-thousandth of a gram.

80% of the workers at the Shenyang De Ke Instrument Factory are young workers who have only been in the factory for two or three years, and most of the equipment is old-fashioned belt-driven machine tools that have been in use for thirty or forty years. However, they have set lofty aspirations, taking the Shanghai Universe Factory, which has a much higher production level, as the object of "learning from, catching up with, and surpassing," determined to catch up with and surpass the Universe Factory in production.

Under the leadership of the Party branch, the workers of the Shenyang De Ke Instrument Factory first directed the spearhead of the technical revolution at the weak link in the factory's production—the machining workshop. The factory director led more than ten veteran workers and technicians to the Shanghai Universe Balance Factory to learn from their experience, and the workers who remained in the factory did not wait. More than 170 employees of the factory voluntarily signed up and formed two teams, each determining the main attack projects of the technical revolution and the dates for achieving them. The two teams launched a competition. In the spirit of making do with whatever is available, they adopted indigenous methods and, in just over a month, manufactured 23 sets of threading machines, polishing machines, broaching machines, and various automatic lathes. The factory's level of "four transformations" (mechanization, semi-automation, automation, and no-man operation) rapidly improved, and production efficiency increased exponentially. For example, using a polishing machine to polish the balance knife rest can polish one in a minute, which is thirty times more efficient than manual operation in the past.

With the substantial increase in output, the most prominent problem encountered by the factory was the shortage of raw materials. The raw materials used to manufacture precision balances are all precious and rare metals. Instead of passively waiting for the state to allocate materials, they regarded modifying product designs as the main measure to break through this key bottleneck. Based on the spirit of daring to think and daring to act, combined with scientific experiments, they determined the principle of "two movements and two non-movements" for modifying product designs. This means: move those places where materials and man-hours are wasted, and do not move those places that affect quality and appearance. Under the leadership of the factory director, experienced veteran workers from all major types of work in the factory were organized to disassemble the products, review them collectively, and widely solicit opinions in the form of exhibitions. Then, the mass opinions were collected, analyzed, and tested. Only after it was confirmed that it would not affect the quality and appearance of the product did they start to modify the design. The seven products produced by the factory have all undergone varying degrees of reform. Among them, the components of three products have changed by more than 50%, which not only reduced manufacturing man-hours but also saved a large number of materials, while ensuring quality.

In order to improve product quality, the factory launched a surge in making fixtures and using template tools widely. At present, the factory workers have made a total of 369 fixtures and template tools for processing various balance parts. Using them in production not only ensures the quality of the parts, but also allows the parts to be interchanged.

In view of the large number of young workers, the Shenyang De Ke Instrument Factory implemented the method of assigning machines and assigning jobs, so that these new workers could become familiar with the habits of the machine tools and the rules of parts processing, and avoid producing defective products. In addition, the factory has also strengthened quality inspection work. Full-time inspectors from the departments go deep into the workshops every day to carry out first-piece inspections and batch processing sample inspections; the workers' inspectors within the group inspect the first piece of work after going to work every day and conduct intermediate patrol inspections. These measures have played a good role in ensuring quality.

At present, the workers of the Shenyang De Ke Instrument Factory are using practical actions of over-producing more and better balances to greet the National Day.

    树雄心立大志　踏踏实实学先进
　　德克仪器厂产量高质量好
    据新华社沈阳27日电　不论技术力量或设备条件都较逊一筹的沈阳市德克仪器厂，立志以生产水平高出自己几倍的上海宇宙天秤厂为
  “学赶超”的对象，踏踏实实，埋头苦干，巧破人员、设备、材料三关，取得了生产全面大跃进。这个去年曾提前四十天全面完成年度生产计划的工厂，今年又早在5月24日完成了本年度的国家计划。到9月19日，这个厂的产品产量超过今年国家计划指标33.4％，并制造出计划外产品——架盘子天秤和工业用天秤二百五十五台，质量合格率比计划提高1％，成本下降26.4％，上缴利润超过289％。跟去年同期相比，产量增长79％。过去这个厂生产的天秤，最后只能反映出万分之一克的重量，现在他们生产的天秤，可以反映出十万分之一克的重量。
    沈阳市德克仪器厂80％的工人是刚入厂两、三年的青工，绝大部分设备是老式皮带机床，并且已经用了三、四十年。可是，他们却立下了雄心大志，把生产水平比自己高得多的上海宇宙厂作为“学赶超”的对象，决心要在生产上赶上宇宙厂，超过宇宙厂。
    在党支部领导下，沈阳市德克仪器厂职工首先把技术革命矛头指向全厂生产的薄弱环节——加工车间。厂长带领着十多名老工人和技术员赶赴上海宇宙天秤厂学习经验，留在厂里的工人也不等待。全厂一百七十多名职工，自动报名，组成了两个大队，分别确定了技术革命的主攻项目和实现日期，两队展开了竞赛。他们本着因陋就简的精神，采用土办法，仅用一个多月工夫，就制造出套丝机、打光机、拉口机和各种自动车床共二十三台，全厂“四化”水平迅速提高，生产效率成倍增长。例如用打光机磨光天秤刀架，一分钟能磨一个，效率比过去的手工操作提高三十倍。
    在产量大幅度增长的情况下，这个厂碰到的最突出问题是原料材料不足。制造精密天秤用的原料材料都是贵重稀有金属。他们没有消极等待国家调拨材料，而是把修改产品设计作为突破这个关键的主要措施。根据敢想敢干和科学试验相结合的精神，确定了“两动、两不动”的修改产品设计的原则。这就是：浪费材料和浪费工时的地方动，影响质量和影响美观的地方不动。在厂长主持下，组织了全厂各主要工种有经验的老工人把产品拆卸开来，集中审核，以展览会形式广泛征求意见，然后把群众意见集中在一起，经过分析、试验，证实确实不影响产品质量和美观以后，才动手修改设计。这个厂生产的七种产品都经过了程度不同的改革，其中三种产品的部件变动在50％以上，不仅压缩了制造工时，也节约了大批材料，同时还保证了质量。
    为提高产品质量，全厂展开了一个大造胎具、广泛使用样板刀的热潮。现在，全厂工人制做的加工各种天秤部件的胎具和样板刀共有三百六十九件，在生产中使用它们，不仅保证了部件的质量，部件还可以互换使用。
    针对青年工人多的特点，沈阳市德克仪器厂实行了定机、定活的方法，使这些新工人能够摸熟机床习性和部件加工规律，避免出废品。另外，这个厂还加强了质量检查工作。科室专职检查人员每天深入车间实行首件检查和成批加工件抽查；小组内的工人检查员，每天上班以后检查第一件活，并作中间巡回检查。这些措施对保证质量起了很好的作用。
    目前，沈阳市德克仪器厂职工正以超产更多更好的天秤的实际行动，迎接国庆节。
