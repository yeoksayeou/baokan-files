Minhe County Party Committees at All Levels Go Deep into the Grassroots to Work and Reside in Teams
Dissect Sparrows, Summarize Experiences, Provide Comprehensive Guidance, and Promote the Increase Production and Practice Economy Campaign

(Our dispatch) Guided by the idea of strengthening first-line leadership and focusing on grain production, Party committees at all levels in Minhe County, Qinghai Province, have universally moved their offices to the grassroots level and implemented the method of working and residing in teams, making various tasks more in-depth, meticulous, and solid.

During the busy spring planting season this year, more than 2,000 cadres from the county, commune, brigade, production team, and production group levels in Minhe County went to the fields to participate in production and lead production. During the field management period, the five levels of cadres were divided into responsibility areas, and together with experienced farmers and technicians, formed thousands of inspection groups to conduct field consultations, inspections, and evaluations. Before the start of the summer harvest, the Party committees at all levels in Minhe County comprehensively analyzed the excellent situation of this year's summer harvest and the characteristics of large harvesting areas and concentrated maturity times. They summarized the experiences of leadership style and working methods in the previous period and decided to move the Party committee offices to the production teams to implement the method of working and residing in teams, strengthen first-line leadership of the summer harvest. In particular, they first moved to backward areas and places with arduous work tasks to work and reside in teams, using the method of grasping both ends and leading the middle, dissecting sparrows, summarizing experiences, and providing comprehensive guidance to ensure the complete victory of the summer harvest. At the beginning of the summer harvest, the county party committee office, under the leadership of Zhou Yujie, the first secretary of the county party committee, moved to the Lizhang Production Team of the Weilagou Commune to work. The commune Party committees also moved to key production teams, and the production teams also correspondingly went to the work teams, fields, and threshing grounds to work.

The experience of Minhe County proves that working and residing in teams is an effective method for leading cadres at all levels to make their work more in-depth, meticulous, and solid. After working and residing in teams, leaders can more carefully dissect a sparrow, enrich their leadership experience, and improve their work level in the practice of grassroots work. When Comrade Zhou Yujie, the first secretary of the county party committee, led some cadres to work and reside in the Lizhang Production Team of the Weilagou Commune, they gained a comprehensive understanding of the production, life, and cadre style of the production team through eating, living, working, and discussing with the commune members. In particular, they investigated and studied the slow progress of the summer harvest at that time and helped the grassroots cadres make specific arrangements for the work. They mobilized the commune members' enthusiasm for production in many ways, and the work efficiency of each person increased by more than two times.

Working and residing in teams better implemented the leadership methods of combining the general with the individual and combining leaders with the masses. Party committees at all levels in Minhe County generally first resided in production teams with arduous tasks. After working and residing in teams, because they went deep into reality, deep into the masses, participated in production, and led production, they did a better job of combining points and surfaces, and using points to drive surfaces. For example, at the beginning of the summer harvest, the county party committee decided that Wang Xian, the secretary of the county party committee, would lead the cadres of the county party committee office to reside and work in the Guantin Commune in the early-maturing area. After arriving at the Guantin Commune, they helped the commune summarize the experience of fast and good summer harvest from actual production. After the county party committee decided to promote it throughout the county, they quickly gathered a large number of laborers, strengthened the grain front, and ensured the smooth progress of the summer harvest.

After the Party committees at all levels in Minhe County universally promoted working and residing in teams, because the cadres worked in a relatively fixed production team, they could better understand the situation and grasp it from all aspects to the end. Therefore, they achieved great results in strengthening weak links and changing the backward situation. The Maying Commune Party Committee was one of the earliest communes in the county to promote working and residing in teams. Since the beginning of spring planting this year, among the several teams where the Party committee has successively worked, one team has become the red flag team of the entire commune, and four teams have caught up with the advanced teams. At the same time, among the 25 production teams in the entire commune, the number of advanced teams has increased to 16, and the appearance of other teams has also changed significantly.

Working and residing in teams by Party committees at all levels is also a good way to improve grassroots cadres. When Party committees at all levels in Minhe County implemented working and residing in teams, they paid attention to not taking over everything, but instead adopted the method of helping grassroots cadres and carrying out work through grassroots cadres. The cadres who worked and resided in the Lizhang Production Team with Zhou Yujie, the first secretary of the county party committee, proposed "four helps" (helping to formulate production plans, helping to arrange labor, helping to run the canteen well, and helping to summarize production experience), effectively improving the leadership level of grassroots cadres and promoting the rapid change in the appearance of the team, resulting in a new situation of "four fasts" (fast in implementing the Party's policies, fast in discovering and solving problems, fast in summarizing and promoting experience, and fast in the actions of cadres and the masses).

At present, the Party committees at all levels in Minhe County are continuing to promote the working method of working and residing in teams, strengthening the leadership of grassroots work, and greatly promoting the current autumn field management work and the increase production and practice economy campaign centered on grain and steel.

The Chengguan People's Commune in Guyuan County, Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, actively implements the "two-five" system of leadership. The commune's leading cadres go deep into the forefront of production, participate in production, and lead production, so that the entire commune's work has taken on a new look. This is the commune party committee holding an enlarged meeting of the party committee in the Chengguan Seventh Squad, which has been weak in its work, to study and solve problems such as labor arrangements in the summer harvest and autumn planting.

    民和县各级党委深入基层住队办公
    解剖麻雀　总结经验　指导全面　推动增产节约运动
    本报讯　青海省民和县各级党委在加强第一线领导，狠抓粮食生产的思想指导下，普遍把办公室搬到基层，实行住队办公，使各项工作更加深入、细致和扎实。
    民和县各级党委在今年春播大忙时，县、社、大队、生产队、生产小队五级干部两千余人，纷纷走到田间，参加生产，领导生产。在田间管理期间，五级干部又分片包干，吸收老农和技术员，组成千组万人巡回检查组，开展田间会诊，检查评比。在夏收开始以前，民和县各级党委全面分析了今年夏收的大好形势和收割面积大、成熟时间集中等特点，总结了前一时期领导作风和工作方法的经验，决定把党委办公室搬到生产队，实行住队办公的方法，加强夏收第一线领导。特别是先搬到那些后进地区和工作任务艰巨的地方住队办公，用抓两头、带中间的方法，解剖麻雀，总结经验，指导全面，以保证夏收工作的全胜。夏收开始时，县委办公室在县委第一书记周玉洁领导下，搬到未拉沟公社里长生产队办公。各公社党委也都搬到重点生产队去，各生产队也相应地到作业队、田间、禾场办公。
    民和县的经验证明，住队办公是各级领导干部把工作做得更加深入、细致、扎实的有效方法。住队办公以后，领导可以比较仔细地解剖一个麻雀，在基层工作的实践中，丰富领导经验，提高工作水平。县委第一书记周玉洁同志率领部分干部在未拉沟公社里长生产队住队办公时，在与社员同吃、同住、同劳动、同商量中，对这个生产队的生产、生活、干部作风作了全面的了解。特别是对当时夏收进度慢的问题，进行了调查研究，并且帮助基层干部具体安排了工作，从多方面调动了社员的生产积极性，使每人收割工效提高了两倍多。
    住队办公更好地贯彻执行了一般和个别相结合，领导和群众相结合的领导方法。民和县各级党委住队办公，一般都先住到任务艰巨的生产队。住队办公以后，由于他们深入实际、深入群众，参加生产，领导生产，所以更好地做到了点面结合，以点带面。如夏收开始时，县委决定由县委书记王宪带领县委办公室的干部，到早熟地区的官亭公社住点办公。他们到达官亭公社后，从实际生产中帮助这个公社总结了夏收又快又好的经验，经县委决定在全县推广以后，迅速调集了大批劳动力，增强粮食战线，保证了夏收工作的顺利进行。
    民和县各级党委普遍推行住队办公以后，由于干部比较固定的在一个生产队办公，可以更好地熟悉情况，从各方面一抓到底，所以在加强薄弱环节，改变后进面貌上取得了很大成效。马营公社党委是全县推行住队办公最早的一个公社，今年春播开始以来，党委先后蹲点办公的几个队中，已有一个队成了全公社的红旗队，四个队赶上了先进队；同时在全公社二十五个生产队中，先进队已增加到十六个，其他队的面貌也有显著改变。
    各级党委住队办公也是提高基层干部的好方法。民和县各级党委在贯彻执行住队办公时，注意不包办代替，而是采取帮助基层干部，通过基层干部去进行工作。同县委第一书记周玉洁一起在里长生产队住队办公的干部提出“四帮”（帮助订生产计划，帮助安排劳力，帮助办好食堂，帮助总结生产经验），有效地提高了基层干部的领导水平，促进这个队的面貌很快得到改变，出现了“四快”（贯彻执行党的政策快，发现问题解决问题快，总结推广经验快，干部群众行动快）的新局面。
    目前，民和县各级党委正在继续推行住队办公的工作方法，加强基层工作的领导，大大推动了当前的秋田管理工作和以粮、钢为中心的增产节约运动。（附图片）
