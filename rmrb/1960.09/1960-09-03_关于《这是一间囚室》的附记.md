    Postscript to "This is a Prison Cell"

    In 1953, the organization approved my recuperation in Beijing. During my recuperation, in order to collect Comrade Zhimin's works and other manuscripts from the Great Revolution period, I conducted a detailed search in relevant libraries and revolutionary history museums in Beijing, Nanjing, Shanghai, Hangzhou, and other places. In Shanghai, I met a comrade. When I talked to him about Comrade Zhimin's posthumous work "Lovely China," he said that Zhimin had some unpublished mimeographed manuscripts that he had seen somewhere. I was very happy at the time! After repeated inquiries, I finally found them, which is the one now published. In addition, I also found some of Comrade Zhimin's poems.

    This posthumous work is written in the third person. Among them, "Xiangsong" is a pseudonym that Comrade Zhimin used to use. Because he was in prison, under the strict surveillance of the enemy, in order to reduce unnecessary trouble and avoid the enemy's attention, it was more convenient to use a pseudonym.

    As far as I know, Zhimin was originally detained in an ordinary cell with Cao Yangshan and two others. Later, the enemy vainly attempted to persuade Zhimin to surrender, so they moved him to the "preferential treatment cell." After reading this article, I deeply feel that no matter what "comfortable" living conditions the enemy used, or with money, official positions, and beauties, attempting to corrupt Comrade Zhimin, it could not shake his strong revolutionary will in the slightest. On the contrary, he cleverly used the "preferential treatment" given to him by the enemy to lead comrades in various struggles, and used revolutionary truth to disintegrate and influence the lower-level staff of the pseudo-detention center, and also wrote many inspiring articles and poems for the Party and the people.

    关于《这是一间囚室》的附记
    1953年，组织上批准我去北京休养，在休养期间，为了搜集志敏同志在大革命时期的作品以及其他遗稿，曾在北京、南京、上海、杭州等地有关图书馆和革命历史博物馆，进行了细致的查询工作。在上海，碰到一位同志，当我和他谈起志敏同志遗著《可爱的中国》时，据他说，志敏尚有一部分未发表过的油印文稿，曾在某处看到过。我当时十分高兴！经再三查询，终于找到了，就是现在发表的这一篇。此外，还找到了志敏同志的一些诗篇。
    这篇遗作，是用第三者的语气写的。其中“祥松”，系志敏同志以前曾经用过的化名。因为他在狱中，处在敌人严密的监视下，为了减少不必要的麻烦，躲过敌人的注意，用化名更方便些。
    据我所知，志敏原与曹仰山等三人同被押在普通号牢房。后来敌人妄想劝诱志敏投降，才把他移到“优待号”来。读了这篇文章，使我深深感到：不管敌人用怎样“舒适的”生活条件，或者以金钱、官职、美女，企图腐化志敏同志，但丝毫也不能动摇他的坚强的革命意志。相反地，他巧妙地利用了敌人给予他的“优厚待遇”，领导同志们进行了各种斗争，并用革命的真理去分化、感召伪看守所的下级工作人员，还为党和人民写下了许多激动人心的文章和诗篇。
