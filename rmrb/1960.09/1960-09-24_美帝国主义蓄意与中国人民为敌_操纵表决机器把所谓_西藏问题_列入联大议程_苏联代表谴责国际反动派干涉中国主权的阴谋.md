　　US Imperialism Deliberately Makes Itself an Enemy of the Chinese People
    Manipulates the Voting Machine to Include the So-Called “Tibetan Question” on the UN General Assembly Agenda
  　Soviet Representative Condemns the International Reactionaries' Conspiracy to Interfere in China's Sovereignty
    Xinhua News Agency, September 23rd dispatch from New York: The United Nations General Assembly General Committee met yesterday afternoon to discuss and approve the agenda for this year's General Assembly session. Under the manipulation of the imperialist countries headed by the United States, the committee actually forced the so-called "Tibetan question," which interferes in China's internal affairs, onto the agenda of this General Assembly session.
    Soviet representative Zorin resolutely opposed including this so-called "question" manufactured by imperialism on the agenda of the General Assembly. Zorin said that the purpose of certain delegations trying to force this issue upon the assembly was to divert the United Nations' attention from many pressing issues that needed to be resolved, and to poison the atmosphere of the assembly. The Soviet representative emphasized that insisting on including the so-called "Tibetan question" on the agenda of the General Assembly was a conspiracy of the international reactionaries and a gross interference in the sovereignty of the People's Republic of China.
    The representatives of the United States and Britain insisted on including this so-called "question," which was put forward by Malaya and Thailand at the instigation of the two countries, on the agenda of the General Assembly. US representative Wadsworth made rampant slander against China in his speech. He babbled that the Chinese government's resolute suppression of the rebellion of the upper-class reactionary elements in Tibet was an "act of depriving [basic human rights]." British representative Dean also falsely accused the Chinese government of carrying out so-called "violence and cruel suppression" in Tibet.
    The representatives of Malaya and Thailand, in accordance with the tune of their masters, wantonly spread rumors and slanders at the meeting, and clamored that the United Nations could not "remain inactive" on the "Tibetan question."
    Under the manipulation of the United States, the General Committee passed the inclusion of the so-called "Tibetan question" on the agenda of the General Assembly by a vote of eleven to four, with five abstentions. The Soviet Union, Bulgaria, Romania, and Yugoslavia voted against, while the United States, Britain, Italy, Japan, Canada, Pakistan, Venezuela, Panama, Haiti, Costa Rica, and the Chiang Kai-shek clique voted in favor. The delegations of Ceylon, Iraq, Sudan, Liberia, and France abstained.
    Based on the proposal of twenty-five Asian and African countries, the committee once again included the Algerian question on the agenda of the General Assembly. French representative Bérard expressed his opposition, attempting to portray France's colonialist aggression against Algeria as France's "internal affairs," and threatening that the French delegation would not participate in, and even oppose, such a "meaningless matter."
    The committee also agreed to include the Soviet Union's proposal on disarmament issues, Romania's proposal on improving good-neighborly relations between European countries with different social systems, Cuba's proposal on land reform, and issues related to racial discrimination in South Africa on the agenda of the General Assembly.
    There are still some agenda items, including the Soviet Union's proposal on the issue of restoring China's legitimate seat in the United Nations and the United States' so-called "Hungarian question" aimed at poisoning the international atmosphere, that have not yet been discussed.
    The committee adjourned and will continue to meet on the 23rd.

　　美帝国主义蓄意与中国人民为敌
    操纵表决机器把所谓“西藏问题”列入联大议程
  　苏联代表谴责国际反动派干涉中国主权的阴谋
    新华社23日讯　纽约消息：联合国大会总务委员会昨天下午开会，讨论和批准本届联大会议议程。在以美国为首的帝国主义国家操纵下，委员会竟然把干涉中国内政的所谓“西藏问题”塞进本届联大议程。
    苏联代表佐林坚决反对把这个由帝国主义制造出来的所谓“问题”列入大会议程。佐林说，某些代表团企图把这个问题强加于大会，目的是要转移联合国对许多迫切需要解决的问题的注意力，企图毒化大会气氛。苏联代表强调指出，硬要把所谓“西藏问题”列入大会议程是国际反动派的一种阴谋，是对中华人民共和国主权的粗暴干涉。
    美、英两国代表坚持要把这个在两国唆促下由马来亚和泰国出面提出的所谓“问题”列入大会议程。美国代表华兹沃斯在发言中大肆诽谤中国。他胡说中国政府坚决镇压西藏上层反动分子的叛乱是“剥夺（基本人权）行为”。英国代表迪安也诬蔑中国政府在西藏进行所谓“暴力和残酷的镇压”。
    马来亚和泰国的代表在会上遵照它们主子的腔调大肆造谣和诬蔑，并且叫嚣联合国在“西藏问题”上不能“保持无所作为”。
    在美国的操纵下，总务委员会以十一票对四票、五票弃权通过把所谓“西藏问题”列入大会议程。苏联、保加利亚、罗马尼亚、南斯拉夫代表团投票反对，美国、英国、意大利、日本、加拿大、巴基斯坦、委内瑞拉、巴拿马、海地、哥斯达黎加以及蒋介石集团投票赞成。锡兰、伊拉克、苏丹、利比里亚和法国代表团弃权。
    委员会根据二十五个亚、非国家的提议，再次把阿尔及利亚问题列入大会议程。法国代表贝拉尔表示反对，他企图把法国对阿尔及利亚的殖民主义侵略说成是法国的“内政”，扬言法国代表团将不参加，甚至反对这样一件“毫无意义的事情”。
    委员会还同意把苏联提出的有关裁军问题、罗马尼亚提出的关于改善欧洲不同社会制度国家间睦邻关系、古巴提出的土地改革以及关于南非的种族歧视等问题列入大会议程。
    还有一些议程，其中包括苏联提出的有关恢复中国在联合国合法席位问题以及美国提出的旨在毒化国际气氛的所谓“匈牙利问题”还没有讨论。
    委员会休会到23日继续举行。
