　　Praising the Light, Whipping the Ugly
　　——On Shandong Bangzi Opera "The Wall Head Story" and "Wan Jia Xiang" 　　Ma Shaobo
　　The Shandong Bangzi Opera Troupe of the Shandong Lu Opera Research Institute came to Beijing to perform excellent plays such as "The Wall Head Story," "Wan Jia Xiang," "Two Wolf Mountains," "Yellow Ox Dividing the Family," and "Jade Tiger Pendant." Among them, the satirical comedy "The Wall Head Story," adapted from Pu Songling's folk songs, and the small modern comedy "Wan Jia Xiang," collectively created by the troupe, were greatly praised by the audience.
　　In his original folk song "The Wall Head Story," the author of "Strange Tales from a Chinese Studio," Pu Songling, revealed the ugly things of feudal society with sharp and sophisticated strokes, prominently expressing his dissatisfaction with these ugly things; however, due to historical constraints and the limitations of the author's worldview, although the original work has more positive factors, it is inevitably stained with the dust of feudalism.
　　The Zibo Wuyin Opera Troupe, one of the local Shandong operas, once adapted and performed this play. The Shandong Bangzi Opera Troupe, based on the adaptation of the Wuyin Opera Troupe, innovated and changed the contradiction between greed and filial piety in the play into a sharp class contradiction, thereby greatly improving the ideology of the play.
　　The adaptation of "The Wall Head Story," through narrating the story of a simple worker—carpenter Zhang's family—due to his two sons growing up, one becoming rich through business and the other marrying into a wealthy family, thereby leading to class differentiation, profoundly exposes the ugly faces of those typical figures of the exploiting class who betray their original class, become people who recognize money but not their father, and believe that "whoever has money is their father," and gives them a powerful lash, ridiculing and scolding them incisively and vividly, constituting a satirical comedy with sharp class contradictions; this elevates the theme of the play from generally advocating filial piety to an ideological level. The adapter grasped the key and "turned stone into gold," which is a gratifying achievement on the opera stage.
　　"Wan Jia Xiang" is a one-act comedy depicting street women participating in the service station work of urban people's communes. The new spiritual outlook and noble communist moral qualities of new people in the new era under the illumination of the three red banners are reflected in several characters in the play. Although the performance of this play only takes about an hour, it vividly summarizes the life of urban people today, is full of a strong sense of the times and realism, and makes people feel kind and moving. All the actors' performances are vivid, whether they are portraying the sixty-year-old service station director, or the young purchaser, or the old Chinese medicine practitioner Zhang Moxuan, they are all full of the breath of life. This is the result of the actors' long-term contact with workers and peasants, their love for the workers and peasants, and their in-depth involvement in the struggle.
　　"The Wall Head Story" satirizes the darkness of the old society, while "Wan Jia Xiang" eulogizes the light of the new era. One profoundly reveals the so-called humanity of the exploiting class in the old society, and the other praises the noble communist style of the proletariat in the new society.
　　In "The Wall Head Story," when carpenter Zhang is old and frail and can no longer make a living by labor, he becomes an eyesore to his two sons. The eldest son holds an abacus and deducts accounts with him, believing that even if his one and a half acres of land for old-age care are left, it will not offset the cost of supporting him over the years; the second son holds the scriptures of sages and sages, quoting scriptures to hate his father for being old and not dying; when carpenter Zhang is pushed to the wall head by his eldest son in the cold winter, and his old life is in danger, he and his wife hide in the house to keep warm by the stove. When silversmith Wang comes up with a clever plan to make them aware that the old man has secret savings, the two sons immediately become "greatly virtuous and filial," vying to care for their old father, displaying their ugliness in every way, and exposing their "whoever has money is their father" humanity nakedly, making it clear at a glance what the humanity of the exploiting class in the old society is.
　　The relationship between people described in "Wan Jia Xiang" precisely reflects the noble thoughts of our proletariat. The service station director, Li Dama, leads women who have just been liberated from household chores to fully undertake the trivial housework of employees in order to liberate women's productivity and support the production of street factories, and even gives meticulous care to the employees' cultural and recreational life. In particular, the righteous and courageous action of Li Dama and others to rescue the old rural woman Zhao is described, and the old Chinese medicine practitioner Zhang Moxuan, who often relies on the service station to handle housework, actively devotes himself to service work. His spirit of taking the initiative to buy tonics for the family members of employees after childbirth in order to ensure the great leap forward in employee production, all typically reflect the collectivist concepts and communist style of the people in the new society.
　　The two plays "The Wall Head Story" and "Wan Jia Xiang," although originating from different eras and having different styles, form a complete artistic structure when performed together, displaying the completely different worldviews of the two classes in front of people, forming an extremely sharp contrast between the new and the old, thereby inspiring the audience to have clear love and hate and generating a strong educational effect. This makes the ideological and artistic nature of the two plays more prominent.
　　According to the policy of "letting a hundred flowers bloom, letting a hundred schools of thought contend, and bringing forth the new from the old," we must vigorously engage in the creation of plays reflecting modern life themes like "Wan Jia Xiang," and at the same time, we must also carry out creative adaptation work on old plays like "The Wall Head Story"; in terms of form, not only are large-scale plays needed by the audience, but also medium and small-sized plays like "The Wall Head Story," which exposes ugliness like a sharp blade, and "Wan Jia Xiang," which praises the light like a movement, are welcomed and needed by the audience. On the opera front, it is equally necessary to advocate high yield, high quality, and multiple varieties to better serve proletarian politics. The reason why the performances of the Shandong Bangzi Opera Troupe are welcomed and praised by the audience is precisely the result of their conscientious implementation of Chairman Mao's literary and artistic policy. Their performances give us some useful inspiration in the work of opera reform.

    歌颂光明  鞭笞丑恶
    ——谈山东梆子剧《墙头记》和《万家香》	马少波
    山东省鲁剧研究院山东梆子剧团来北京演出《墙头记》、《万家香》、《两狼山》、《黄牛分家》、《玉虎坠》等优秀剧目，其中根据蒲松龄俚曲改编的讽刺喜剧《墙头记》和该团集体创作的小型现代题材喜剧《万家香》大为观众所赞赏。
    《聊斋志异》作者蒲松龄在他的原作俚曲《墙头记》中，以犀利老辣的笔锋，揭露了封建社会的丑恶事物，突出地表现了他对这些丑恶事物的不满；但由于历史的制约和作者世界观的局限，虽然原作具有较多的积极因素，却也不可避免地沾有封建性的灰尘。
    山东地方剧之一的淄博五音剧团曾经改编上演这个剧目，山东梆子剧团又在五音剧团改编的基础上，经过推陈出新，把剧中贪财与孝道的矛盾改变为尖锐的阶级矛盾，从而大大提高了剧目的思想性。
    《墙头记》的改编本，通过叙述在一个朴实的劳动者——张木匠的家庭中，由于他的两个儿子成年后，一个经商发财，一个入赘富家，因而发生阶级分化的故事，深刻地揭露了那种背叛原来阶级，变成认钱不认父，“有钱便是爹”的剥削阶级典型人物的丑恶面目，并且予以有力的鞭笞，嘻笑怒骂，淋漓尽致，构成了一个具有尖锐的阶级矛盾的讽刺喜剧；使这个剧目的主题，从一般的提倡孝道而提高了思想性。改编者抓住了关键，“点石成金”，这是戏曲舞台上一个可喜的收获。
    《万家香》是一个描写街道妇女参加城市人民公社服务站工作的独幕喜剧。在剧中几个人物的身上，都反映了在三面红旗照耀下的新时代新人物的新的精神面貌和高贵的共产主义道德品质。这个戏的演出虽然仅用一小时左右的时间，却生动地概括了今天城市人民的生活面貌，富有强烈的时代感和真实感，使人看了觉得亲切动人。所有演员的表演都是生动的，他们无论是表现六十多岁的老服务站长，或是表现青年采购员、老中医张墨轩等，都富有生活气息。这正是演员们长期与工农相处，热爱工农群众，深入斗争生活的结果。
    《墙头记》讽刺了旧社会的黑暗，《万家香》讴歌了新时代的光明。一个是深刻地揭示了旧社会剥削阶级的所谓人性，一个是颂扬了新社会无产阶级的崇高的共产主义风格。
    在《墙头记》中，张木匠到了年迈体衰，不能再以劳动为生的时候，就成了两个儿子的眼中钉。大儿子是手拿算盘，分斤掰两地和他扣账，认为就是把他的一亩半养老地留下，也折不了几年来对他赡养所费之资；二儿子则手捧圣贤经传，引经据典地恨爹老而不死；当数九寒天，张木匠被长子撮到墙头上，老命岌岌可危的时候，他却和老婆躲在屋里围炉取暖。及至王银匠想出一条妙计，使他们知道老爹暗有积蓄之后，两个儿子便立刻变得“大贤大孝”，争养老父，丑态百出，赤裸裸地暴露了他们的“有钱就是爹”的人性，旧社会剥削阶级的人性究竟是什么，使人一目了然。
    在《万家香》中所描写的人与人之间的关系，恰恰表现了我们无产阶级的高贵的思想。服务站长李大娘领导着刚刚从家庭琐事中解放出来的妇女，为了解放妇女生产力，支援街道工厂生产，而全力承担起职工的家务琐事，甚至对职工的文娱生活，也给予无微不至的关心。特别是其中所描写的李大娘等抢救农村老大娘赵氏的见义勇为的行动，和经常依靠服务站处理家务的老中医张墨轩积极投入服务工作，他为了保证职工生产大跃进，主动为分娩后的职工家属代买补养品的当仁不让的精神，都极为典型地反映了新社会人们的集体主义观念和共产主义风格。
    《墙头记》和《万家香》这两个戏，虽然出于不同的时代，具有不同的风格，但是放在一起演出，却形成了一个完整的艺术结构，在人们的面前展示了两种阶级的截然不同的世界观，使新与旧之间形成极其鲜明的对比，因而能够启发观众爱憎分明，产生强烈的教育作用。这就使得两出戏的思想性和艺术性更加突出。
    根据“百花齐放、百家争鸣、推陈出新”的方针，我们既要大力从事像《万家香》这样反映现代生活题材的剧目的创作，同时也要进行对《墙头记》这种旧有剧目的创造性的改编工作；在形式上，则不仅大型剧目为观众所需要，《墙头记》像利刃般的揭露丑恶，《万家香》像乐章般的歌颂光明，这种中、小型剧目，也为观众所欢迎，所需要。在戏曲战线上，是同样应该提倡丰产、优质、多品种，更好地为无产阶级政治服务。山东梆子剧团的演出所以受到观众的欢迎和称赞，正是他们认真执行毛主席文艺方针的结果。他们的演出，使我们在戏曲革新工作中获得一些有益的启发。
