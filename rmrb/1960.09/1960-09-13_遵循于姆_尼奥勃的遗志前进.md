Follow the Will of Félix-Roland Moumié
　　　　Cameroonian Students: Philippe Bingue et al.
    On September 13, 1958, the French colonial authorities arrested and brutally murdered Félix-Roland Moumié, the beloved leader of the Cameroonian people and the General Secretary of the Union of the Peoples of Cameroon. Moumié's death plunged the Cameroonian people into extreme grief. For several days, many were unwilling to face this cruel and merciless fact, clinging to a final glimmer of hope that this wise and beloved leader had not been harmed. Others believed it was a rumor spread by the French colonial propaganda machine to create sudden terror among the Cameroonian people, in order to disintegrate the revolutionary people's fighting spirit.

    Yes, the Cameroonian people grieved the loss of their leader, but they were not intimidated. Although Comrade Moumié had sacrificed himself, his heroic image remained forever in the hearts of the Cameroonian people. The people commemorated him, transforming grief into strength, and marched forward valiantly following his will.

    The touching scene of Comrade Moumié's heroic sacrifice is still widely circulated in Cameroon today. Comrade Moumié, at the time of his sacrifice, held his head high and sang the national anthem, facing the enemy with his chest out, firmly believing that the Cameroonian people's struggle against French colonialism for independence would surely achieve final victory.

    On New Year's Day this year, as a result of the long-term and heroic struggle of the Cameroonian people, the French colonialists were forced to agree to Cameroon's independence. Although today the French colonial army still remains in our country, slaughtering our beloved compatriots, and ravaging our beautiful land, we firmly believe, as firmly as Comrade Moumié believed, that the Cameroonian people will, in the not-too-distant future, completely shatter those French colonial forces that still tarnish our sacred land, and will certainly realize the will of our beloved Comrade Moumié.

    遵循于姆·尼奥勃的遗志前进	喀麦隆留学生　菲力浦·宾格等
    1958年9月13日，法国殖民当局逮捕了、并且惨无人道地杀害了喀麦隆人民敬爱的领袖、喀麦隆人民联盟总书记于姆·尼奥勃。尼奥勃的死，曾经使喀麦隆人民陷于极度的悲痛中，几天之内，有好些人都还不愿意正视这个残酷无情的事实，终是怀着最后一线希望，想着这位英明的、为人民爱戴的领袖并没有遭到毒手；另外的一些人却认为这是法国殖民者的宣传机器为了在喀麦隆人民中间制造突然的恐怖，以便瓦解革命人民的斗志而散布的谣言。
    是的，喀麦隆人民为失去自己的领袖而悲痛过，但是，他们并没有被吓倒。于姆·尼奥勃同志虽然已经牺牲了，但他的英勇的形象却永远留在喀麦隆人民的心里，人民纪念着他，化悲痛为力量，遵循着他的遗志，奋勇前进。
    关于于姆·尼奥勃同志慷慨就义时的感人的情景，至今仍广泛地在喀麦隆留传着。尼奥勃同志在就义时昂首高唱着国歌，在敌人面前挺着心胸，深信喀麦隆人民反对法国殖民主义，争取独立的斗争一定能取得最后的胜利。
    今年元旦，由于喀麦隆人民长期英勇斗争的结果，法国殖民者被迫同意了喀麦隆的独立。虽然今天法国殖民军仍然留在我们的国家，屠杀着我们亲爱的同胞，蹂躏着我们美丽的国土。但是，我们坚决相信，像于姆·尼奥勃同志一样坚决地相信，喀麦隆人民在不远的将来，一定会彻底粉碎那些仍然玷污着我们神圣国土的法国殖民势力，一定能够实现我们亲爱的尼奥勃同志的遗志。
