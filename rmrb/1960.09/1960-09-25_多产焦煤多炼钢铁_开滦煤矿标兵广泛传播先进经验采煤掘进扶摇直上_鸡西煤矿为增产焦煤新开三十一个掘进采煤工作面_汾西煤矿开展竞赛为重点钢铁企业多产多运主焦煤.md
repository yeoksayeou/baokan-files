Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, September 24th: In the high tide of the production increase and economy drive to offer a great gift to National Day, the vast number of workers at the Kailuan Coal Mine have seen coal production and tunneling footage soar. In mid-September, the average daily coal production level increased by 9.81% compared to the first ten days of the month, and tunneling footage increased by 4.2%.

    In order to ensure the fulfillment of the conditions proposed to all coal mines across the country, and to create even greater achievements to welcome National Day, the Kailuan Coal Mine Party Committee further explained the situation to the workers, assigned tasks, explained key points, and provided measures in early September. A fervent competition unfolded in various mines.

    In the competition, pacesetters from various mines spread their advanced experiences everywhere and "settled" in backward teams and groups to help improve technical operating levels. Twelve hundred pacesetters from the Zhaogezhuang Mine, promoting the spirit of communist large-scale collaboration and hard struggle, have voluntarily settled in backward teams and groups, going to the most difficult places to take the lead in combat, allowing advanced experiences to blossom and bear fruit everywhere, and helping the backward catch up with the advanced. After Li Baitang, a national first-class coal mining pillar pacesetter, settled in the Huang Youhe coal mining pillar group, which had a relatively weak foundation, he helped the Huang Youhe group establish the ambitious goal of "catching up with the advanced;" at the same time, he enthusiastically helped them improve their techniques. As a result, the work efficiency of the Huang Youhe group workers quickly caught up with the advanced level. With the help of the pacesetters, 60% of the backward groups in the Zhaogezhuang Mine have reached the advanced level, thereby ensuring that the entire mine exceeded its coal production plan every day in mid-September. The workers in the four hundred and eighty-six groups in the fifteen mining and tunneling areas of the Tangshan Mine, centering on starting work early, producing coal early, fully utilizing working hours, and accelerating coal mining progress, launched a production campaign to increase coal production and offer gifts to National Day. All shifts in the mine actively strengthened collaboration and created favorable conditions for each other, so that the starting time of each coal mining face was advanced by about one hour every day compared to the past. Therefore, 80% of the coal mining faces in the entire mine can exceed their tasks every day.

    Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, September 24th: The Jixi Mining Bureau in Heilongjiang Province, which produces coking coal, has fully tapped labor potential and strengthened the front line of mining and tunneling, enabling the entire mine to increase by twenty-one tunneling workfaces and ten coal mining workfaces, creating conditions for a large increase in coking coal production throughout the mine.

    The Jixi Coal Mine has transferred more than 3,100 people to enrich the front line of mining and tunneling, including 822 leading cadres at all levels, technical personnel, and general cadres from functional departments who have been delegated layer by layer to strengthen underground production. Among these cadres, more than 60 mine-level cadres have been sent to various wells to serve as well directors, engineering section chiefs, or tunneling team leaders; some of the original mine directors have also been delegated layer by layer to the working face, serving as mining and tunneling team leaders, group leaders, or working as mining and tunneling workers along with general cadres. More than 2,000 workers have been saved from logistics departments such as mechanical and electrical and pit timber yards after technical innovation and technical revolution, and reasonable adjustments to labor organization. 60% of these new mining and tunneling workers have been able to independently undertake tasks such as drilling, supporting, and moving scrapers after learning and working at the same time.

    The cadres who have been delegated to the grassroots level have integrated with the workers, jointly studying to break through key problems. Zhang Qingping, the well director of the Ninth Well of the Didao Mine, after being delegated to the Second Engineering Section to serve as the captain of the First Tunneling Team, studied with the workers and launched a competition between the three shifts, with the advanced leading the backward; at the same time, he used methods of improving operations to solve the key problem of insufficient electric drilling machines, so that the tunneling progress of the three shifts was increased from more than two meters per day to more than five to seven meters. Li Chenghe, the maintenance captain of the Third Well of the Muleng Mine, was originally an old tunneling worker. After returning to the tunneling team this time, he found that because there were many new workers in the team, their skills were not proficient enough, and the angle of the drilling was not good, resulting in the failure to collapse coal after blasting, and they had to use manual planing and wind picks to pull the bottom, which affected the loading progress; at the same time, due to the poor quality of the sheds, sometimes the sheds were knocked down by a cannon, requiring re-shedding, which affected the tunneling efficiency. After Li Chenghe helped the new workers in the team improve the operating techniques of drilling and improved the quality of the sheds, he reduced the auxiliary production time, so that the daily tunneling footage was increased from three meters to ten meters. This team completed 50% of the monthly tunneling plan from September 1st to 9th. Jiang Haiquan, the deputy well director of the Ninth Well of the Chengzhe River Mine, after being delegated to the 491 Youth Coal Mining Team, together with section chief Zhang Qin and workers and technicians, improved the bottom groove of the coal cutting machine, so that each time a coal section was cut, thirty cutting teeth could be saved, and the coal cutting time was shortened from fourteen hours to about seven hours. Jiang Haiquan also led the workers to conscientiously implement advanced experiences such as fast scraper moving, multiple blasting at one time, sectional contracting, and coal shoveling, so that the daily output of this team increased from the original 247 tons to more than 400 tons. Then, they used this team as an example to organize other teams to learn from and catch up with the 491 team, promoting the overall increase in daily production level of the well.

    Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, September 24th: In the first twenty days of September, the Fenxi Mining Bureau in Shanxi Province transported more than 10,000 tons more prime coking coal to iron and steel enterprises such as Wuhan Iron and Steel, Shanghai Iron and Steel, Baotou Iron and Steel, and Taiyuan Iron and Steel than in the same period in August; the prime coking coal produced in these twenty days increased by 5.6% compared to the middle and late August.

    The prime coking coal produced by the Fenxi Mining Bureau accounts for one-third of the total coking coal production in the province. The bureau's employees responded to the initiative of nine coal mines, including Fushun, to increase the production of raw coal, and launched a competition in September to produce more coal, produce better coal, and support increased steel production. Various mines and pit entrances have respectively set up competition evaluation areas such as "Commanding Stage," "Martial Arts Stage," and "Champion Stage." Pits and pits, teams and teams, groups and groups, and people and people found opponents, issued challenge letters to each other, and strived to be the first. The "Tunneling to Guarantee Recovery, Repair to Guarantee Machinery and Electricity, Machinery and Electricity to Guarantee Transportation, Transportation to Guarantee Coal Mining, Logistics to Guarantee Production" mutual guarantee chain competition launched by the employees of the Zhangjiazhuang Mine greatly strengthened the mutual collaboration and mutual support between various departments. In order to prepare the working face for the Third Recovery Team as early as possible, the Red Flag Tunneling Team promoted advanced experiences such as deep-hole blasting, and the daily progress was rapidly increased from twenty meters to twenty-five meters. The workers in the repair department automatically went to the pit to patrol and inspect, and set up repair and spare parts warehouses in the pit, so that where problems were found, they were solved there, promoting production.

    The party organizations and trade union organizations of various mines and pit entrances of the Fenxi Mining Bureau have strengthened their leadership over the competition movement. Various mines have promptly evaluated and announced the results of the competition, effectively promoting the in-depth development of the competition movement.

    After technical innovation and technical revolution, the Fenxi Mining Bureau saved more than 1,700 people from basic construction and service industries, strengthened the front line of production, and increased by a total of nineteen tunneling teams and five recovery teams. The bureau also transferred more than 200 cadres to be sent to the mining and tunneling teams, groups, and canteens to serve as branch secretaries, deputy team leaders, deputy group leaders, shift leaders, and administrators, strengthening the party's leadership over the work of the teams and groups. Various teams and groups have generally established and improved systems such as attendance, handover, pre-shift preparation meetings, and post-shift inspection meetings. Various mines and pit entrances have also generally established underground offices, leading cadres have implemented an underground duty system, and section and office cadres have taken the initiative to go deep into the site to help teams and groups improve management systems and improve management levels.

    汾西煤矿开展竞赛为重点钢铁企业多产多运主焦煤
    新华社天津24日电　开滦煤矿广大职工在开展向国庆节献厚礼的增产节约竞赛高潮中煤炭产量和掘进进尺扶摇直上，9月中旬煤的平均日产水平比上旬提高了9.81％，掘进进尺提高了4.2％。
    开滦煤矿党委为了保证实现向全国各煤矿提出的倡议条件，创造更大的成绩迎接国庆节，在9月上旬就进一步向职工大讲形势，交任务、交关键、交措施、各矿展开了热烈的竞赛。
    在竞赛中，各矿的标兵到处传播先进经验，并到后进队、组去“落户”，帮助提高技术操作水平。赵各庄矿的一千二百名标兵，发扬共产主义大协作和艰苦奋斗的革命精神，已主动到后进队、组去落户，到最困难的地方去带头战斗，让先进经验遍地开花结果，帮助后进赶上先进。全国一级采煤支柱标兵李百堂到基础比较差的黄有和采煤支柱小组去落户以后，帮助黄有和小组树立了“赶上先进”的雄心壮志；同时热情地帮助他们提高技术。结果，黄有和小组工人的工作效率，很快地赶上了先进水平。在标兵们的帮助下，赵各庄矿已经有60％的后进小组达到了先进水平，从而保证全矿在9月中旬天天超额完成了煤产量计划。唐山矿十五个采掘区的四百八十六个小组的工人，以早开工、早出煤、充分利用工时、加快采煤进度为中心，开展多增产煤炭向国庆节献礼的生产运动会以后，全矿各班都积极加强协作，互创有利条件，使得各采煤掌子面开工时间每天都比过去提前一小时左右。因此，全矿80％的采煤掌子面都能天天超额完成任务。
      新华社哈尔滨24日电　黑龙江省生产焦煤的鸡西矿务局充分挖掘劳动潜力，加强采掘第一线，使全矿增开掘进工作面二十一个，采煤工作面十个，为全矿大量增产焦煤创造了条件。
    鸡西煤矿已抽调三千一百多人充实采掘第一线，其中有八百二十二名是层层下放、加强井下生产的各级领导、技术人员和职能科室的一般干部。在这些干部中，有六十多名矿级干部已下到各井担任井长、工段长或掘进队长；原来的部分矿井井长也层层下放到掌子面，担任采掘队长、小组长，或者和一般干部一起当了采掘工人。另有两千多工人是从机电、坑木场等后勤部门，经过技术革新和技术革命，合理调整劳动组织以后节约出来的。这些新的采掘工人有60％的人经过边学边干，已能独立担任打眼、支架、移溜子等工作。
    下放到基层的干部，都同工人们打成一片，共同研究突破关键。滴道矿九井井长张清平下放到二工段担任第一掘进队队长后，和工人们一起研究，在三个班之间开展竞赛，以先进带后进；同时用改进作业的办法，解决了电动打眼机不足这一关键问题，使三个班掘进进度都由原来日进二米多，提高到五米到七米多。穆棱矿三井维修大队长李成和，原来是个老掘进工人，这次回到掘进队后，发现这个队因为新工人多，技术不够熟练，打眼时角度找得不好，结果爆破以后，崩不下煤来，还得用人工刨煤，用风镐拉底，影响了装车进度；同时因棚子质量不高，有时一放炮就打倒了棚子，需要重新搭棚，影响掘进效率。李成和帮助队里的新工人改进打眼的操作技术，提高了棚子质量以后，减少了辅助生产时间，使日掘进进尺由三米提高到十米。这个队9月1日至9日就完成了全月掘进计划的50％。城子河矿九井副井长姜海泉下放到491青年采煤队后，和段长张勤及工人、技术员一起，改进了割煤机的底槽，使每截一次煤可节约三十个截齿，截煤时间也由十四小时缩短到七小时左右。姜海泉还领导工人认真推行了快速移溜子、一次多放炮、分段包干、攉煤等先进经验，使这个队日产量由原来二百四十七吨提高到四百多吨。然后，他们又以这个队为榜样，组织其他队学、赶491队，促进全井提高了日产水平。
    新华社太原24日电　山西省汾西矿务局在9月头二十天中，运往武钢、上钢、包钢和太钢等钢铁企业的主焦煤比8月份同期增加了一万多吨；这二十天生产的主焦煤比8月中、下旬增长了5.6％。
    汾西矿务局生产的主焦煤占全省焦煤总产量的三分之一。全局职工响应抚顺等九个煤矿关于增产原煤的倡议，9月份开展了多出煤、出好煤、支援钢铁增产的竞赛。各矿、各坑口分别设立了“点将台”、“比武台”、“状元台”等竞赛评比园地。坑与坑、队与队、组与组、人与人各找对手，互下战表奋勇争先。张家庄矿职工开展的“掘进保回采，修理保机电，机电保运输，运输保采煤，后勤保生产”的互保连环赛，大大加强了各个部门之间的相互协作，相互支援。红旗掘进队为了给三回采队提早准备好工作面，推广了深孔爆破等先进经验，日进度由二十米迅速提高到二十五米。修理部门的工人自动到坑下巡回检查，并在坑下设立了修配站和备品仓库，做到在那里发现问题，就在那里解决，促进了生产。
    汾西矿务局各矿、各坑口的党组织和工会组织，都加强了对竞赛运动的领导。各矿都及时评比、公布竞赛的结果，有力地推动了竞赛运动的深入开展。
    汾西矿务局经过技术革新和技术革命以后，从基本建设和服务行业中节约出一千七百多人，加强了生产第一线，共增加了十九个掘进队和五个回采队。全局还抽调了二百多名干部分别下放到采掘队、组和食堂，分别担任支部书记、副队长、副组长、值班班长、事务长等职务，加强了党对队、组工作的领导。各个队、组普遍建立与健全了考勤、交接班、班前准备会、班后检查会等制度。各矿、各坑口还普遍成立了井下办公室，领导干部实行了井下值班制，科、室干部主动深入现场，帮助队、组改进管理制度，提高管理水平。（附图片）
