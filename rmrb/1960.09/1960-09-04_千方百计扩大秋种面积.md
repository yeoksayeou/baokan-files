Exhaust Every Means to Expand Autumn Planting Area

Comrades in many places and many communes have made ambitious pledges: strive to make the total output of summer harvest crops next year exceed any previous year. To achieve this goal, we must go through a series of intense battles. The first hurdle is autumn planting. The requirements for autumn planting are to plant more and plant well.

The main autumn-sown crops are winter wheat, rapeseed, and green manure. Winter wheat generally accounts for one-fifth to one-quarter of the total sown area of ​​grain crops throughout the year, and about one-third in some areas; rapeseed generally accounts for one-third of the total sown area of ​​oil crops throughout the year; most of the green manure is sown in autumn. Wheat is one of the main foods of the people in the north, and a considerable part of the summer rations in many areas in the south are also wheat. The pastries eaten by people all over the country are mainly made of wheat, and most of the industrial grain is also wheat; wheat straw is an important industrial raw material and feed. Rapeseed is one of the main sources of edible oil; rapeseed cake is one of the important commercial fertilizers for crops; rapeseed stalks and pods are also good feed. Purple alfalfa and other green manure crops have high yields, great fertility, and require less labor, making them a good base fertilizer for spring-sown crops. Although the sown area of ​​these crops in previous years has accounted for a considerable proportion, it is still far behind spring-sown crops. According to the needs of the entire national economic development, the total output of these crops needs to be greatly increased. To increase the total output, we must simultaneously increase planting and yields; during the sowing period, it is particularly important to plant more. Only on the basis of planting more and striving for high yields can we guarantee a bumper harvest.

In most areas, there are fewer natural disasters during the growing period of autumn-sown crops, and winter wheat, the main autumn-sown crop, is more cold-resistant and drought-resistant, so the harvest is relatively stable. There were particularly many natural disasters last year and this year, but summer harvest crops in the southern provinces generally increased this year. All southern provinces that expanded the area of ​​autumn-sown crops last year have benefited this year. In the severe drought year of 1952, the unit yield of grain crops throughout the year in Hubei Province decreased by 10.2% compared with the previous year, while the unit yield of summer harvest grain crops decreased by only 1.8% compared with the previous year. Expanding the winter wheat planting area in the north is also very beneficial. This year, under the circumstances of heavy disasters, although the unit yield of wheat in some areas has decreased, the total output is not less than in previous years, or has increased slightly, mainly because the planting area has been expanded. In many places in the Northwest region, increasing the proportion of autumn-sown crops is also conducive to avoiding disasters; in many places, the unit yield of winter wheat is higher than that of spring wheat.

Increasing the proportion of autumn-sown crops is also conducive to adjusting the uneven use of labor throughout the year, and also conducive to arranging life in summer and autumn. In areas where summer harvest crops are harvested earlier, this benefit is even more obvious. If the southern provinces seriously regard autumn-sown and winter-sown grain crops as an important season of crops, they can achieve an extra season of grain harvest in vast areas. An earlier bumper harvest next year will have a great positive effect on the development of the entire year's agricultural production and even the entire national economy. It is even more important to strive to plant more in autumn this year when there are particularly many disasters and the summer or autumn harvests in some areas have been reduced. Many areas regard expanding the area of ​​autumn-sown and winter-sown as a strategic deployment in the overall economic construction, which is completely correct.

How can we ensure the expansion of the autumn planting area? The most important move is to look ahead and behind, make overall arrangements, and make the most reasonable and full use of every inch of land.

Autumn planting land should be planned from many aspects. "Regular stubble land," that is, cultivated land that has not grown other crops after the summer harvest, or has only grown green manure crops after the summer harvest, and is now planted with autumn-sown crops again, is the most basic land for autumn planting. With the increase of the multiple cropping area, the area of ​​this part of the land has decreased; however, it still occupies a very important position in autumn planting, and we must strive to achieve high yields and even higher yields on this part of the land. This part of the land should be plowed as early as possible, deeply plowed, irrigated, and moisture preserved. Low-lying and waterlogged areas should be drained earlier, and base fertilizer should be applied as much as possible in combination with deep plowing. In short, the quality requirements of sowing preparation work should be as high as possible.

In addition to "regular stubble land," a large amount of land for autumn planting is "catch-up stubble land," or "return stubble land," that is, cultivated land that has been planted with autumn harvest crops after the summer harvest, and then sown with summer harvest crops after the autumn harvest. With the expansion of the multiple cropping area, this part of the cultivated land has increased this year, and this type of cultivated land will become more and more in the future. To grow "catch-up stubble land" well, the most important thing is to "catch up with time." On the one hand, all the preparations before sowing must be done properly as early as possible, so that during the autumn harvest period, we can plow and sow as soon as we harvest. In the past, a part of the crops were often sown under hard stubble (sowing again without plowing) or under bare ground (sowing again without applying base fertilizer), mainly on these "catch-up stubble land." This phenomenon should be eliminated as much as possible. On the other hand, under the condition of not hindering the increase of production and ensuring the harvest of autumn harvest crops, we should try our best to promote the early maturity and early harvest of autumn harvest crops. This is very beneficial for autumn harvest crops to avoid frost damage and reduce chaff grains, and it is also very beneficial for timely sowing of summer harvest crops.

Another important way to expand the autumn planting area is to engage in intercropping and interplanting on a large scale. This requires more overall planning and a comprehensive arrangement of the planting plans for this autumn and winter and next year. For example, Wendeng County, Shandong Province, has already arranged to interplant more than 70,000 mu of winter wheat in radish and cabbage fields during the autumn sowing this year; after harvesting radishes and cabbages in winter, summer corn, sweet potatoes, etc. can be interplanted in wheat fields next spring. In order to expand the wheat area without reducing the area for planting peanuts next spring, it is planned to interplant peanuts in more than 100,000 mu of wheat fields next spring under the condition of planting more wheat. This county has increased the sown area by nearly 80,000 mu this year by adopting the interplanting method; continuing to adopt this method, it can expand the sown area by more than 100,000 mu next year compared with this year, of which the wheat sown in autumn this year can be increased by about 10,000 mu. Doing so can also bring forward some of the summer planting work to the spring, to a certain extent solving the problem of excessively concentrated summer farm work, so that the summer harvest and summer planting can be done faster and better. Doing so can also appropriately increase the growing period of summer corn, increase the yield of summer corn; and can make the corn mature earlier, which is convenient for autumn planting next year.

Interplanting crops in forest land is an important measure to rationally utilize land. A large number of facts have proved that doing so is conducive to both forestry production and agricultural production. Most of the time when autumn-sown crops grow, the trees shed their leaves, sunlight is easy to shine, and air is easy to circulate, so interplanting is especially beneficial, especially a large number of young forest land is more suitable for interplanting. In this year's autumn planting, we must regard interplanting grain in forest land as an important position for expanding the sown area.

In order to expand the autumn planting area, we must open up wasteland as much as possible in areas where conditions permit. In addition to border areas, barren slopes and barren hills in mountainous and hilly areas, river beaches and lake edges in plains and lake areas, all places with wasteland can be reclaimed. Hubei Province has paid special attention to this point this year and has made great achievements. Cultivating and planting this part of the land well this autumn will also add a new force to the summer harvest next year.

Scattered land should also continue to be fully utilized in autumn planting. In particular, rapeseed, broad beans, etc. are more suitable for planting on various scattered lands.

We advocate planting as much as possible, the purpose is to ensure a bumper harvest. We must plant more under the condition of striving to plant well. Therefore, various preparatory work and specific measures must be adapted to the requirements of expanding the area and increasing the total output. At present, we must pay special attention to accumulating fertilizer and making fertilizer. There are many late autumn crops this year, the demand for topdressing is large, and the autumn planting area is to be expanded, so we must pay more attention to accumulating and making more fertilizer to prepare base fertilizer for autumn planting. The autumn planting area is to be expanded, and the area of ​​rational close planting is also to be expanded. We must prepare enough good varieties, select and dry them well, and keep them in special warehouses, and must not misappropriate them; and there must be a certain amount of reserve seeds in case of emergency. This year's autumn planting task is even greater, and the autumn harvest task is also more arduous than in previous years. In addition to concentrating more labor force and using labor force more rationally on the front line of agriculture, improved agricultural tools and agricultural machinery used for autumn plowing and autumn planting must also be prepared as early as possible.

We must ensure that the plan to strive for a great summer harvest next year takes root among the masses. We must widely and deeply mobilize the masses to discuss the autumn planting plan, discuss the important significance of expanding the area and increasing measures for ensuring increased production, and implement the sown area, output plan and various measures to each production team, and even to each small team. If the measures are not implemented, the plan to expand the area and the output plan cannot be truly implemented.

Ensuring more planting cannot be separated from the word "early." If the preparatory work is not done early, there is no guarantee of planting more; if we do not sow in time and early, we will miss the sowing period, and it is impossible to plant more. Starting around the White Dew (September 7), the autumn planting work will gradually start from north to south. To win a greater victory in the battle of large-scale agriculture and large-scale grain production next summer, we must fight this first battle well. Time is already pressing, let's get started quickly!

    千方百计扩大秋种面积
    许多地方、许多公社的同志们立下了雄心大志：争取明年夏收作物总产量超过以往任何一年。要达到这个目的，必须经过一连串紧张的战斗。第一关就是秋种。秋种的要求是种的多，种的好。
    秋播的主要作物是冬小麦、油菜和绿肥。冬小麦一般占全年粮食作物播种总面积的五分之一到四分之一，有些地区占三分之一左右；油菜一般占全年油料作物总面积的三分之一；绿肥的绝大部分都在秋季播种。小麦是北方人民的主要食粮之一，南方许多地区的夏季口粮也有相当大一部分是小麦，全国各地人民吃的糕点主要是小麦做成的，工业用粮中大部分也是小麦；小麦的秸秆是重要的工业原料和饲料。油菜是食油的主要来源之一；油枯是农作物的重要商品肥料之一；油菜的秸秆荚角也是很好的饲料。紫云英等绿肥作物产量高、肥力大、用工少，是春播作物的很好的基肥。这些作物往年的播种面积，虽然已经占有相当大的比重，但与春播作物相比还是差得很远。按照整个国民经济发展的需要来说，这几种作物的总产量都需要大大增加。要增加总产量，必须多种多收和高产多收同时并举；在播种时期，特别重要的是多种。只有在多种的基础上力求高产，才能保证多收。
    在大部分地区，秋播作物生长期间自然灾害较少，加以主要的秋播作物冬小麦比较耐寒耐旱，所以收成比较稳定。去年、今年各地的自然灾害特别多，而南方各省今年夏收作物普遍增产。南方各省凡是去年扩大了秋播作物面积的，今年都得到了好处。在大旱的1952年，湖北全省全年粮食作物的单位产量比上一年减少10.2％，而夏收粮食作物的单位产量比上一年只减少1.8％。北方扩大冬小麦播种面积也大有好处。今年在受灾较重的情况下，有些地区小麦单位产量虽然减少了，但是总产量并不比往年减少，或者稍有增加，主要原因就是扩大了播种面积。西北地区有很多地方增加秋播作物比重，也利于避开灾害；很多地方冬小麦的单位产量比春小麦的单位产量高。
    提高秋播作物的比重，还有利于调整全年各季劳动力使用不均衡的状况，又有利于夏秋两季生活的安排。在夏收作物收获较早的地区，这个好处更加明显。南方各省把秋播冬播粮食作物认真当成一季重要的作物来抓，就可以在广大地区做到多收一季粮食。明年较早地得到一季丰收，对于全年的农业生产以至整个国民经济的发展，都有很大的积极作用。在今年灾害特别多、部分地区夏季或秋季减产的情况下，争取秋季多种一些就更加重要。许多地区把扩大秋播冬播面积作为经济建设的全局中的一项战略部署，这是完全正确的。
    怎样才能确保扩大秋播面积呢？最要紧的一着是瞻前顾后、统筹安排，最合理最充分地利用每一寸土地。
    秋播用地要从很多方面筹划。“正茬地”，也就是夏收以后没有种别的作物，或者夏收以后只种了绿肥作物，现在再种秋播作物的耕地，是秋播的最基本的土地。随着复播面积的增加，这一部分土地的面积减少了；但是，它在秋播中仍然占着很重要的地位，要力争在这一部分土地上实现高产更高产。这一部分地应该尽可能早耕、深耕、灌水、保墒，低洼水多的地方要早些排水，还要尽可能地结合深耕多施基肥。总之，要求播种准备工作尽可能达到最高的质量。
    “正茬地”以外，秋播的大量的土地是“赶茬地”，或者叫“回茬地”，也就是夏收之后种了秋收作物，秋收之后再播种夏收作物的耕地。随着复播面积的扩大，这一部分耕地今年有所增加，今后这一类耕地会越来越多。要种好“赶茬地”，最要紧的是“赶时间”。一方面，要把播种前的一切准备工作早些做得停停当当，到了秋收期间做到随收随耕，及时播种。过去往往有一部分庄稼硬茬下种（没有耕过就又播种）或白地下种（不施基肥就又播种），主要是在这些“赶茬地”上。这种现象应当力求消灭。另方面，要在不妨碍秋收作物增产保收的条件下，尽力促进秋收作物早熟早收。这对于秋收作物避免遭受冻害和减少秕籽大有好处，对于夏收作物及时播种也大有好处。
    扩大秋播面积的又一个重要门路是大搞间作套种。这更需要通盘筹划，把今年秋冬和明年的种植计划作全面的安排。例如山东文登县，已经安排好今年秋播的时候要把七万多亩冬小麦套种在萝卜、白菜地里；冬天收了萝卜、白菜以后，明春在麦地里又可以套种夏玉米、甘薯等。为了扩大小麦面积而又不减少明春种花生的面积，打算在多种小麦的条件下，用十几万亩小麦地明年春天套种花生。这个县今年采用套种的办法，已经比去年增加播种面积近八万亩；继续采用这种办法，明年可以比今年再扩大播种面积十万多亩，其中今年秋播的小麦可以增加大约一万亩。这样做，还可以把一部分夏种工作提前到春天做，在一定程度上解决夏季农活过于集中的问题，使夏收夏种可以做得更快更好。这样做，还可以适当增加夏玉米的生长期，提高夏玉米的产量；又可以使玉米早些成熟，便于明年秋种。
    林地套种庄稼，是合理利用土地的一个重要措施。大量事实已经证明，这样做既有利于林业增产，也有利于农业增产。秋播作物生长的大部分时间，林木落叶，阳光容易照射，空气容易流通，套种尤其有利，特别是大量的幼林地，更适宜于套种。在今年秋播中，要把林地套种粮食作为扩大播种面积的一个重要阵地。
    为了扩大秋播面积，在有条件的地区还要尽可能开垦荒地。除了边疆地区以外，山区、丘陵区的荒坡、荒岗，平原、湖区的河滩、湖边，凡是有荒地的地方都可以开垦。湖北省今年就特别注意抓这一条，已经做出很大成绩。把这一部分地在今年秋季耕好、种好，也将为明年夏季丰收增添一支生力军。
    零星土地，在秋播中也要继续充分利用。特别是油菜、蚕豆等，更适宜于在各种零星土地上种植。
    我们提倡尽量多种，目的是为了确保多收。一定要在力求种好的条件下多种。因此，各种准备工作、各项具体措施必须同扩大面积和增加总产量的要求相适应。当前要特别注意积肥造肥。今年晚秋作物多，追肥需要量大，秋播面积又要扩大，就更要注意积造更多肥料，为秋播准备好基肥。秋播面积要扩大，合理密植的面积也要扩大。必须准备足够的优良品种，选好晒好，专仓保管，不得挪用；并且要有一定数量的后备种子，以备不时之需。今年秋种任务更大了，秋收任务也比往年繁重，除了在农业第一线集中更多劳动力和更合理地使用劳动力以外，对于秋耕秋播用的改良农具和农业机械也要及早准备。
    一定要使争取明年夏季大丰收的计划在群众中落脚生根。要广泛地深入地发动群众讨论秋播计划，讨论扩大面积和增加措施对于保证增产的重要意义，使播种面积、产量计划和各项措施落实到每个生产队，直到每个小队。措施如果不落实，扩大面积的计划和产量计划就不可能真正落实。
    保证多种，离不开“早”字。不早把准备工作做好，多种就没有保证；不及时早播，误了播种期，也不可能多种。从白露（9月7日）前后开始，秋播工作就要由北而南次第展开。大办农业、大办粮食的战斗要在明年夏季取得更大胜利，必须把这第一仗打好。时机已经紧迫了，大家赶快动手吧！
