This newspaper's dispatch from Xi'an on the 18th: People's communes across Shaanxi Province, in light of the new situation of larger autumn planting areas and more replanting this year, are stepping up autumn planting preparations, striving to plant early and plant well, laying a good foundation for increasing summer harvest next year.

Under the guidance of the principle of planting more and harvesting more, as well as high-yield and more harvest, various places in Shaanxi Province have expanded the autumn planting area according to local conditions. This year, due to the increase in water conservancy facilities and prolonged drought, the water levels of large, medium, and small rivers have dropped, and arable river beaches have generally increased. The masses along the banks of large, medium, and small rivers have universally launched a movement to seize land from the rivers. After organizing surveys of rivers, ditches, and mountains by production teams in the Shangluo area, it was found that the area has a total of 360,000 mu of usable river beach, which is equivalent to one-tenth of the area's existing cultivated land, and more than 91,000 mu of river beach land has now been built. In the Guanzhong area along the Wei River, Baoji, Xingping, Xianyang, Weinan and other places have recently organized commune members to reclaim land from the Wei River beach. Xianyang City has organized more than 50,000 laborers to reclaim 35,000 mu of wasteland on the Wei River beach. The masses in the Qinling and Bashan mountainous areas have also launched a movement to ask the mountains for grain and expand the autumn planting area. At present, the province's summer grain crop area has been fully implemented, and the wheat planting area will be expanded by more than 800,000 mu compared with last year.

This year's autumn planting area is larger than any previous year, and the demand for seeds, fertilizers, and tools is also greater than in previous years. In light of this situation, various places have generally carried out various autumn planting preparations in advance, highlighting the two main links of increasing production: fertilizer and deep plowing, and accelerating the progress of preparation work. Up to now, all the wheat fields that are to be replanted have been deeply ploughed, with a depth of about six inches, and 30% of them have been ploughed twice. This has bought time to concentrate on deep plowing the newly expanded wheat fields. In order to prepare enough base fertilizer for autumn planting, various places launched a fertilizer accumulation and transportation campaign as early as July. Hancheng County has launched three successive shock fertilizer accumulation campaigns from July to now, accumulating 45 billion jin of fertilizer, providing sufficient base fertilizer for 950,000 mu of wheat fields, and most of the fertilizer has been transported to the fields. In the fertilizer accumulation campaign, various places have generally paid attention to accumulating fertilizer locally and making fertilizer locally. The Shangluo area has universally established fertilizer composting pits in the fields, and the northern Shaanxi area has also moved sheep pens, livestock pens, and pig pens to the fields according to local conditions. This practice not only solves the need for base fertilizer for wheat fields, but also saves a lot of labor. Various places have also added and repaired sowing tools in advance, and prepared sufficient seeds and pesticides needed for autumn planting. According to statistics from the agricultural machinery department, 1,000 row sowing machines have been prepared this year, an increase of 840 compared with last year, which provides favorable conditions for accelerating the sowing progress. According to a survey by Pucheng County on the preparation of autumn planting tools in various communes, the communes can strive to complete all sowing within ten days.

Another feature of this year's autumn planting work in Shaanxi Province is the increase in wheat fields for replanting. In the Guanzhong area, the WeiHui, JingHui, LuoHui and other irrigated areas, wheat fields for replanting account for more than 80%, and a large part of the wheat for replanting is high-yield fields and "insurance fields". Therefore, ensuring the planting of wheat for replanting is not only an important measure to strive for comprehensive and balanced yield increase, but also a key to striving for high yield and more harvest. To this end, party committees at all levels have organized cadres, technicians, and the masses to summarize the experience of high yields of wheat for replanting over the years. The main experiences are: meticulous land preparation, timely early planting, and sufficient base fertilizer application. In the past, the reason for the low yield of wheat for replanting in some places was mainly due to late planting, rough land preparation, and less fertilizer. Therefore, in order to win a bumper harvest of wheat for replanting next year, various places have launched a campaign to promote early maturation of autumn crops and early land release. Xingping County invited experts, technicians, and experienced farmers to hold discussions, and organized the masses to classify and rank 1.04 million mu of autumn fields, and put forward measures to promote early maturation of autumn crops. For example, more than 600,000 mu of corn were universally applied with quick-acting fertilizer, the depth of deep cultivation was increased, and pests and diseases were eliminated. Artificial pollination was strengthened for late corn to promote early grouting, and the top tips of corn that had been grouted were removed. And adopt the method of harvesting as soon as they are ripe, striving to release the land early and sow wheat in time. The Mawei Commune concentrated 80% of its labor force to carry out an autumn field management campaign centered on promoting early maturation of autumn crops. The effect of all the processed autumn fields is very significant, and the maturity period of general corn has been advanced by about ten days.

(Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, September 18) The battle to plant wheat in the suburbs of Beijing is in full swing. The people's communes are seizing the season for planting wheat, the "tail of White Dew, the head of Autumn Equinox," rushing to harvest, cultivate, and plant. As of the 16th, more than 600,000 mu of wheat land had been vacated in the suburbs, 420,000 mu of wheat land had been cultivated, and more than 100,000 mu of wheat had been planted.

This year's wheat planting plans in the suburbs were determined after full discussion by the masses from the bottom up. Before the start of wheat planting, in accordance with the Party's policy of vigorously developing agriculture and grain production, the basic accounting units and contracting units of the communes mobilized commune members to specifically discuss how much wheat to plant and what methods to use for planting, so that the land, base fertilizer, water conservancy, seeds, and tools in the wheat planting plan were all implemented, and the wheat planting plan was generally practical, satisfying the commune members, team cadres, and commune leaders.

Now, commune members in various places are carrying out competitions, organizing professional teams to manage wheat, and striving to realize their own wheat production increase plans. The seeds, fertilizers, machinery and other items needed for wheat planting have also been arranged properly. Wheat improved varieties can basically meet the needs of planting, and the quality of base fertilizer applied is also better than in previous years. In order to plant in time and save labor, the communes have also paid special attention to giving play to the role of machinery. Many communes have focused on the inspection, maintenance, and training of technical operators of machinery, and have formulated detailed mechanical sowing plans. Workers on the agricultural machinery production front in Beijing actively and enthusiastically support wheat planting. As of September 10, they had manufactured 308 wheat sowing machines and repaired 208 tractors, which were put into the wheat planting battle.

This year's wheat planting in the suburbs of Beijing is coinciding with autumn drought. In order to overcome the drought and win this battle of autumn planting, counties (districts) and communes are actively taking drought-resistant and drought-preventing measures, repairing, renovating, and expanding existing irrigation projects, digging canals and wells, searching for surface and underground water sources, and paying attention to saving water. Chaoyang and other districts (counties), after inspecting the soil moisture and water sources, are conducting research and proposing measures to seize the opportunity to plant, trying every means to find water sources and expand the area of irrigated land.

Party committees at all levels in the suburbs of Beijing have strengthened the leadership of wheat planting work. The autumn harvest command posts of counties (districts) and communes have been established, and the party secretaries have personally taken charge, dividing the work and assigning responsibilities, and organizing a large number of cadres to go deep into the front line of wheat planting. At the beginning of wheat planting, Shunyi County transferred more than 200 cadres from county-level agencies to work in production teams to strengthen the leadership of backward teams. The Wanghua Commune of Huairou County set up eleven field command sheds in the concentrated wheat field areas, where cadres ate and lived in the fields to lead commune members to plant wheat. The communes have also expanded the area of high-yield fields this year. In order to ensure the need for labor, various agencies, factories, schools, and troops in Beijing have organized labor armies and are sending them to the countryside in batches to help plant wheat.

    开拓河滩荒山扩大面积　大搞深翻积肥作好准备　促秋早熟腾出回茬麦地
    陕西抢季节多种麦种好麦
    北京郊区农民充分讨论秋播计划，各级干部深入种麦第一线
    本报西安18日电　陕西省各地人民公社根据今年秋播面积大、回槎多的新情况，加紧进行秋播准备工作，力争种早、种好，为明年夏收增产打好基础。
    陕西省各地在多种多收与高产多收的方针指导下，根据当地不同情况，因地制宜扩大了秋播面积。今年由于水利设施增多，加以长期干旱，大、中、小河流水位下降，宜耕的河滩地普遍增多。各大、中、小河流两岸的群众普遍发起了与河争地运动。商雒专区以生产队为单位组织逐河、逐沟、逐山勘察以后，发现全区共有可以利用的河滩计有三十六万亩，相当于全区现有耕地面积的十分之一，现已修好河滩地九万一千多亩。关中沿渭河两岸的宝鸡、兴平、咸阳、渭南等地，最近都组织社员群众向渭河河滩要地。咸阳市已组织五万多劳力，在渭河滩开荒三万五千多亩。秦岭和巴山山区的群众也都开展了向山要粮、扩大秋播面积的运动。现在，全省夏粮作物面积已全部落实，其中小麦播种面积将比去年扩大八十多万亩。
    今年秋播面积比已往任何一年都大，种籽、肥料、工具也比往年需要量大。各地根据这一情况，普遍提前进行了各项秋播准备工作，突出地抓住肥料和深翻两个主要增产环节，加快准备工作进度。到目前为止，全省正槎麦田已全部深翻完毕，深度都达六寸左右，其中有30％已翻两遍。这就赢得了时间，能够集中力量深翻新扩大的麦田。为了给秋种准备足够的底肥，各地早在7月间就开展了积肥运肥运动。韩城县从7月到现在先后开展了三次突击积肥运动，已积肥四百五十亿斤，给九十五万亩麦田全部备足底肥，并且大部肥料已运往田间。在积肥运动中，各地都普遍注意就地积肥，就地造肥。商雒专区普遍在田间建立了沤肥坑，陕北地区还根据当地的条件，把羊圈、牲口圈、猪圈搬到了田间。这种作法，既解决了麦田底肥的需要，又节省了大量的劳力。各地还都提前增添和修配了播种工具，备足籽种和秋播所需要的药械。据农业机械部门统计，今年条播机已准备好一千部，比去年增加八百四十部，这给加快播种进度提供了有利条件。据蒲城县对各公社秋播工具准备情况的调查说明，各公社可以争取在十天内全部播种完毕。
    陕西省今年秋播工作另一个特点，是回茬麦田增多。关中地区的渭惠、泾惠、洛惠等灌区，回茬麦田占80％以上，而其中有很大一部分回茬麦是丰产田和“保险田”。因此，保证种好回茬麦，不仅是争取全面均衡增产的重要措施，也是争取高产多收的一个关键。为此，各级党委都组织干部、技术人员和群众总结了历年来回茬麦丰收的经验。其中的主要经验是：精细整地、适时早种、施足底肥等。过去有些地方回茬麦低产的原因，则主要是播种迟、整地粗糙、肥料少。因此，各地为夺取明年回茬小麦丰收，都开展了促秋早熟、早腾地的工作。兴平县邀请专家、技术人员、老农举行座谈，并组织群众对一百零四万亩秋田分类排队，分别提出了促秋早熟的措施。如对六十多万亩玉米普遍加施速效肥、加深中耕深度和消灭病虫害。对晚玉米加强了人工授粉，促使早灌浆，对已灌浆的玉米则一律打去顶尖。并且采取随熟随收的办法，争取早腾地，适时播种小麦。马嵬公社集中了80％的劳力突击进行以促秋早熟为中心的秋田后期管理运动。凡是经过加工的秋田效果都很显著，一般玉米成熟期都提前了十天左右。
    本报讯　北京郊区种麦战斗正在紧张进行。各人民公社紧紧抓住“白露尾、秋分头”最宜种麦的季节，抢收、抢耕、抢种。截至16日，全郊区已经腾出麦地六十万亩，耕好麦地四十二万亩，种好小麦十万多亩。
    今年郊区的种麦计划，都是自下而上经过群众充分讨论后确定的。在种麦开始以前，根据党的大办农业、大办粮食的方针，各公社的基本核算单位和承包单位都发动社员具体讨论了种多少小麦，用什么方法播种等问题，使种麦计划中的地块、底肥、水利、籽种、工具做到五落实，种麦计划一般都比较切实，做到了社员、队干部和公社领导三满意。
    现在各地社员正在开展竞赛，组织管理小麦的专业队伍，力争实现自己亲手制订的小麦增产计划。小麦播种所需的种籽、肥料、机具等也都安排妥当。小麦良种基本上可以满足播种需要，所施底肥质量也比往年好。为了及时播种，节省劳力，各公社还特别注意发挥机械的作用，不少公社大抓机具的检修、维护和技术操作人员的培训，制订了详细的机播计划。北京市农业机械生产战线上的职工积极热情地支援小麦播种，到9月10日为止，已经制造出小麦播种机具三百零八部，还修好拖拉机二百零八台，投入种麦战斗。
    今年京郊小麦的播种正逢上秋旱。为了战胜干旱，打好秋播这一仗，各县（区）、公社正积极采取抗旱防旱措施，整修、改建、扩建现有灌溉工程，开渠打井，寻找地上地下水源，并注意节约用水。朝阳等区（县）在检查了墒情和水源以后，正在逐块研究提出抢墒抢播的措施，千方百计挖水源，扩大水地面积。
    北京郊区各级党委加强了种麦工作的领导，县（区）、公社的三秋指挥部都已成立，党委书记亲自挂帅，分片包干，并且组织大批干部深入种麦第一线。顺义县在种麦开始时，又从县属机关中抽调了二百多名干部到生产队工作，加强对后进队的领导。怀柔县王化公社在麦田集中地区搭了十一个田间指挥棚，干部吃住在田，领导社员种麦。各公社今年还扩大了丰产方的面积。为了保证劳力需要，北京市各机关、工厂、学校、部队还组织了劳动大军，正在分批到农村帮助种麦。
