Zhan Jixie sets an example for the masses everywhere
    Consistently promotes a hardworking and simple style; Always maintains the true qualities of the working people

    "Brother Jixie has been a cadre for ten years, and he labors and lives with us, without the slightest airs or special treatment, even more hardworking and frugal than us in labor and life." This is the assessment of the masses of the Yuanxi Brigade of the Chengguan Commune in Youxi County, Fujian, regarding their Party Branch Secretary, Zhan Jixie.

    Comrade Zhan Jixie, who came from a hired-laborer background, is both an outstanding leader and an ordinary worker. For ten years, he has served as militia captain, mutual aid team leader, agricultural cooperative director, credit cooperative director, township head, and branch secretary, always maintaining the industrious and simple nature of the working people and the excellent style of close contact with the masses, thoroughness, and hard work.

    Zhan Jixie has a habit: every time he goes out, he always carries a hoe and a load of baskets. When he sees too much water in the fields, he enlarges the drainage outlet; when he sees too little water, he raises and thickens the ridges, then releases water from the upper field. Although there are many sources of fertilizer in the mountainous areas, it is not easy to accumulate high-quality fertilizer. Every time Zhan Jixie goes to the county for a meeting, regardless of wind or rain, he always carries a load of baskets or manure buckets. When he returns, he carries the fertilizer back. If he goes by water, he takes firewood and several loads of manure buckets into the city, returning with more manure. From the end of last year to now, in just eight or nine months, he has taken advantage of his trips to the city for meetings to transport more than 860 loads of firewood and more than 60,000 jin of fine fertilizer such as pig manure and human excrement. One day at the end of December last year, it was very cold and raining. He and two model laborers went to the county for a meeting. The commune members advised them, "Don't take manure buckets, we will send them to you by boat tomorrow." Zhan Jixie said, "No, if we bring the manure buckets a day later, we will accumulate ten fewer loads of fertilizer." With that, he and the two commune members, carrying the manure buckets, braved the wind and rain, and walked twenty li of muddy mountain roads to the meeting. At the meeting place, they reported while arranging the manure buckets they had brought with them in several corners of the meeting place. During the meeting, the three of them took advantage of the early morning, noon, and evening breaks to carry load after load of human urine to the boat. After attending the seven-day meeting, the model laborers not only learned many valuable experiences in increasing production, but also accumulated more than eighty loads of human manure to transport back to the brigade. Another time, he went to the commune for a meeting and found a thick layer of black mud piled up in front of the commune auditorium (converted from an old house). Zhan Jixie became interested in this layer of "sole dirt." He immediately asked someone to call the commune members to send a boat to transport the mud fertilizer, while he began to shovel the soil. In total, he gathered twenty-five loads of fertilizer. From then on, the reputation of "Secretary of Collecting Manure" and "Secretary of Accumulating Fertilizer" spread.

    Zhan Jixie is also a good hand at farming, proficient in plowing, harrowing, hoeing, and transplanting. When he labors with the commune members, he always does the work very carefully. Sometimes, when the production team lacks technical expertise, he can lend a hand. During the busy summer planting season, Zhan Jiguan, the plowman of the Antou Production Team, fell ill, and no one else could be found to replace him. In order to seize the season, Zhan Jixie carried his bedding to the production team and stayed there. During the day, he plowed and harrowed the fields, and at night, he took charge of the production leadership for the entire brigade. Zhan Jiguan was sick for more than ten days, and Zhan Jixie acted as the plowman for more than ten days, enabling the production team to complete the plowing and transplanting of late rice five days ahead of schedule. He is very busy with his work and always tries to do his work at night as much as possible, freeing up time to participate in production. The Yuanxi Brigade is twenty li away from the county seat, and it only takes two hours to get to the county and commune for meetings. Every time he goes to the county for a meeting, he calculates the time in advance, goes to the fields to work first, and then rushes to the county seat for the meeting when the time is about right. Sometimes, when the meeting ends early, he turns back to the fields to work halfway. For five years, Zhan Jixie has been one of the county's Party branch secretaries who participates in the most labor. In 1956, he did 280 workdays, in 1957, he did 274 workdays. After the communization, the work team stationed in the township was transferred away, and the workload increased, but he still did more than 240 workdays every year. Since the beginning of this year, he has participated in labor for an average of about twenty days per month. Because Zhan Jixie actively participates in labor, he has also inspired the labor enthusiasm of the Party members, cadres, and commune members of this brigade. Last year, all twelve semi-detached cadres in the brigade did a total of 3,056 workdays, averaging more than 250 workdays per person.

    The Yuanxi Brigade is a mountainous area with large forests and scattered villages. The four production teams and six villages of the entire brigade are distributed in an area of thirty li. The distance between villages is six li at the closest and ten li at the farthest, which brings many difficulties to the leadership work. However, Zhan Jixie has always insisted on going to the front line to grasp first-hand information, combining the general with the individual, so that his leadership methods can adapt to the characteristics of the very scattered villages. In recent years, whenever a central task comes, he always studies and arranges a period of work within the Party branch, then goes deep into each production team and group to inspect and help with the work. Whether it is in the severe winter or the hot summer, he often climbs mountains and wades through water, walking from one village to another.

    In March of this year, the plum rain fell continuously. Zhan Jixie, wearing a raincoat and carrying a hoe, set out before dawn, wading across the river and climbing over several mountain ridges, to the Guyuan Production Team, which had always been doing well in production. At this time, the fields of the Guyuan Production Team were full of people working. Some were standing on the high field ridges splitting the mountainside, some were building field ridges, and some were turning the soil and leveling the fields to dissolve the soil. It was a busy scene of spring plowing! Zhan Jixie went down to the fields and started working with the commune members. After working for a while, he felt strange: why, in this production team where women participate in labor the best, only two women were working today: one was the member of the Communist Youth League, Fan Yuxiang, and the other was the women's production team leader, Lin Yueying. He asked Lin Yueying, "Why are so few women participating in production?" Lin Yueying said, "They don't have rain gear on rainy days, so they don't work." Zhan Jixie felt that this made sense. But he thought about it and asked, "What about sunny days?" Lin Yueying said, "There are not many sunny days either." "What is the reason?" Lin Yueying said: The women have opinions about the evaluation of work points. In the past, men and women were evaluated with the same work and recorded the same points. Now, the men's points are flexibly evaluated, but the women's points are fixed without evaluation, supposedly to allow the women to rest earlier. For example, Zheng Baojin competed with her husband in turning the soil. The man turned 1.2 mu and recorded twelve points, while the woman turned 1 mu and only recorded seven points. Zhan Jixie said: I will definitely solve this problem. That day at noon, Zhan Jixie took advantage of the rest time to hold a cadre meeting to further clarify the situation and help the production team find two solutions: one was to adopt the method of pricing according to quality and purchasing with cash to mobilize commune members to donate and sell old coir raincoats. The second was to implement the principle of equal pay for equal work for men and women, changing the fixed points without evaluation to flexible evaluation. The commune members were generally satisfied and quickly donated and sold more than ten old coir raincoats, which could be used after a little repair. The women were even happier. The next morning, although it was raining even harder, the female commune members were wearing coir raincoats and went to the fields very early. Many female commune members also competed with the male commune members. In the competition, the speed of female commune member Zheng Baojin in turning the soil even surpassed her husband.

    Once, he heard that the Wangyuantou Production Team was lagging behind in both production and work, so he braved the continuous spring rain and came here to settle down. Along the way, he inspected the production situation while walking. He saw that the wheat in the fields was already ripe and had not yet been harvested; the rice transplanting season was approaching, but the soil in the fields had not yet been turned; the weeds on the mountainside had not been cleared. Zhan Jixie convened a symposium of cadres in the evening and asked them why this was the case. The cadres complained that the masses were "backward." As he listened, he thought that the Party has repeatedly taught us that there are no backward masses, only backward leaders. The main reason why the masses are not doing well in production is that the cadres have not done their work well. He decided to go deep into the masses to understand the situation in detail. He moved his bedding to the home of Wang Rongzhu, a poor peasant activist, ate with Wang Rongzhu at the same table, went to the fields together, and carried water to water Wang Rongzhu's vegetables after returning from work in the evening, and swept the floor early in the morning. Within a few days, he and Wang Rongzhu became as close as brothers and talked about everything. Zhan Jixie asked Wang Rongzhu why production was not doing well and what the commune members' opinions were. Wang Rongzhu told him his and the commune members' views in full. The main problems were that although the production team leader took the lead in production, he did not do a good job in grasping life. When work tasks came, he did not fully mobilize the masses, and some cadres rarely participated in production. A few well-to-do middle peasants were unwilling to engage in agricultural production and ran out to engage in private sideline occupations. After clarifying the situation, Zhan Jixie convened a cadre meeting and laid out the problems existing in the work. He affirmed the production team leader Wang Youxi's active role in taking the lead in participating in production, called on everyone to learn from him, and also criticized him for not caring about life and not paying attention to work methods. He also conducted patient education on the shortcomings of other cadres, and at the same time carefully studied ways to improve work. And according to the requirements of the broad masses of commune members, through reasoning and debate, resolutely stopped the capitalist activities of a few well-to-do middle peasants. The problems were basically solved, but Zhan Jixie did not leave the production team immediately. He participated in production every day, using his exemplary actions to educate and influence cadres and the masses. The cadres saw that the Party branch secretary went to the fields with the commune members to work every day, and they also went to the fields in separate groups to lead production at the production site. The commune members saw that the cadres had all gone to the fields, and their enthusiasm for labor was high. In particular, the number of women participating in labor increased from more than a dozen to thirty-five. More than thirty mu of ripe wheat was all harvested in one day. The early rice transplanting ended ten days ahead of schedule, and the planting area was doubled compared to last year, winning the red flag for expanding the planting of early rice in the entire brigade. At this time, Zhan Jixie also focused on grasping life, going to the canteen to work as a cook for more than thirty days, working with the cooks and discussing ways to improve. He delivered food and vegetables to the commune members three times a day, promoted the superiority of the public canteen, and mobilized the commune members to engage in household production. He took the lead in starting early and working late with the commune members to reclaim wasteland, planting fifteen mu of vegetables (averaging 1.5 fen per person), and also ran twenty-six li of mountain roads to the county to buy piglets and ducklings, raising twenty-five pigs and more than 120 chickens and ducks. The canteen's household foundation was established, the diet was greatly improved, and the commune members were willing to come to the canteen to eat. Now, the production team is doing well in production and life, and has leapt from a backward team to an advanced team.

    For ten years, Zhan Jixie has maintained a hardworking and simple, thrifty lifestyle. His family of seven has only one full laborer and his wife as a semi-laborer to participate in labor. Before the communization, it would have been more difficult for a semi-laborer to support the lives of these seven people. But because he was frugal, he had some surplus money every year and never overspent. The prizes and bonuses awarded to him personally by the state and the commune were all handed over to the brigade as public property.

    Under Zhan Jixie's active impetus and influence, the Party members, cadres, and commune members of the Yuanxi Brigade are all enthusiastically participating in production and leading production. Therefore, the team's production and various tasks are done very well, turning a "poor mountain ditch" into a "rich granary." Last year, the total grain output increased nearly two and a half times compared to 1949, with an average of 1,040 jin of grain per person. The total value of production increased three and a half times compared to 1949, with an average income of more than 700 yuan per household. Every commune member has savings, and they also support the country with large quantities of grain and timber every year.　　　　　　　　　Ye Guanghui

    詹基燮处处为群众树立榜样
    一贯发扬艰苦朴素的作风　始终保持劳动人民的本色
      “基燮哥当了十年干部，和我们一同劳动，一样生活，没有半点架子，没有半点特殊，甚至劳动和生活比我们更艰苦。”这是福建尤溪县城关公社园溪大队的群众对党支部书记詹基燮的评语。
    雇工出身的詹基燮同志，既是一个出色的领导者，又是普通劳动者。十年来，他当过民兵队长、互助组长、农业社长、信用社主任、乡长、支部书记，始终保持着劳动人民的勤劳质朴的本色和密切联系群众、深入细致、踏实苦干的优良作风。
    詹基燮有一个习惯，每次出门总扛上一把锄头挑上一担畚箕，看见田里水多了，就把田缺放水口挖大，看见田里水少了，就把田缺加高培厚，再把上一丘田里的水放下来；碰到牛粪、狗粪，就用锄头铲到畚箕里挑回来。山区肥源虽多，但是不易积到优质肥。詹基燮每次到县里开会，不论刮风下雨，总要随身挑一担畚箕或是粪桶，回来时把肥挑回。如果是从水路去，他就带着柴炭和几担粪桶进城，回来时装着更多的粪便。去年底到现在短短八、九个月时间，他利用进城开会的机会，运出了八百六十多担柴，运回猪粪、人粪尿等精肥六万多斤。去年12月底的一天，天气很冷，又下着雨，他和两个劳动模范到县里开会。社员劝他们说：“不要带尿桶去，待明天我们撑船给你们送去”。詹基燮说：“不，迟带一天尿桶，就少积十多担肥。”说着，和两个社员，挑着尿桶，冒着风雨，踩着二十里泥泞的山路去开会。到了会场，一边报到，一边把随身带去的尿桶，安排在会场几个角落。开会期间，他们三人每天利用清早、午晚休息时间，把一担又一担的人尿挑到船里。劳动模范会开了七天，他们除学习到许多宝贵的增产经验外，还积了八十多担人粪尿运回大队。又有一次，他到公社开会，发现公社礼堂（旧房子改建的）门口堆积着厚厚的一层黑泥土，詹基燮对这一层“鞋底土”发生了兴趣，一面叫人打电话通知社员撑船来运泥肥，一面动手铲土，一共搞了二十五担肥。打这以后，“拾粪书记”、“积肥书记”的名声就传开了。
    詹基燮还是个种田的好把手，犁耙锄插，样样精通，他和社员一同劳动中总是把活做得很精细，有时生产队的技术力量不足，他还能帮一手。夏种大忙期间，安头生产队犁田手詹基官病倒了，一时找不到别人代替，为了抢季节，詹基燮背着铺盖到这个生产队住下，白天犁田、耙田，晚上抓整个大队的生产领导，詹基官病了十多天，他就当了十多天的犁田手，使这个生产队连作晚稻犁田插秧比原计划提前五天完成。他工作很忙，总是尽可能把工作放在晚上做，腾出时间参加生产。园溪大队离县城二十华里，到县里和公社开会只要走两个钟头就到了。每次到县里开会，他都预先算好时间，先下田劳动，时间差不多了，才赶到县城开会。有时会议结束得早，他就从半路转到田里劳动。五年来詹基燮一直是全县党支部书记参加劳动最多的一个。1956年他做了二百八十个劳动日，1957年做了二百七十四个劳动日，公社化后，驻乡工作组调走了，工作担子加重，每年仍然做了二百四十多个劳动日。今年以来，他平均每月都参加劳动二十天左右。由于詹基燮积极参加劳动，也鼓舞了这个大队党员、干部和社员的劳动积极性。去年全大队十二个半脱产干部共做了三千零五十六个劳动日，平均每人做了二百五十多个劳动日。
    园溪大队是个山大林密、村庄很分散的山区。全大队四个生产小队、六个村庄分布在方圆三十里地方。村与村的距离，近的六里，远的十里，给领导工作带来了许多困难。但是詹基燮一直坚持到第一线去抓第一手材料，把一般和个别结合起来，使自己的领导方法能够适应村庄十分分散的特点。这些年每逢中心任务一来，他总是在党支部内把一段工作研究布置好，就深入到各个生产队、组去检查、帮助工作，不论是隆冬，还是盛夏，他经常是爬山涉水，从这个村落走到那个村落。
    今年3月，黄梅雨下个不停，詹基燮戴着斗笠，扛着锄头，天还没有亮，便涉水过河，爬过几座山岭，来到一向生产搞得较好的古元生产队。这时，古元生产队田野满是劳动的人群，他们有的站在高高的田垅上劈山边，有的在做田埂，有的在翻土、整地溶田，好一片春耕繁忙的景象！詹基燮走下田去，和社员们一起干了起来。干了一会儿，他觉得奇怪：为什么这个妇女参加劳动最好的生产队，今天妇女出工的只有两个：一个是团员范玉香，一个是妇女生产队长林月英。他问林月英：“妇女参加生产为什么少了？”林月英说：“下雨天没有雨具，不出工。”詹基燮觉得有道理。但是他想一想又问：“晴天呢？”林月英说：“晴天也不多”。“那是什么原因？”。林月英说：妇女们对评工分有意见。以前男女劳动评一样工，记一样分，现在男的是死分活评，对妇女据说是为了照顾妇女早点休息，改为死分不评。譬如郑宝金跟她男人比赛翻土，男的翻一亩二分记了十二分，女的翻了一亩只记七分。詹基燮说：我一定解决这个问题。当天中午詹基燮就利用休息时间，开个干部会议，进一步弄清情况，并帮助生产队找出两个解决办法：一是采取按质论价、现钱收购的办法，发动社员献售旧棕衣。二是执行男女同工同酬原则，改死分不评为死分活评。社员普遍感到满意，很快就献售旧棕衣十多件，这些旧棕衣稍补一下就能用。妇女们更是高兴，第二天清早，虽然雨下得更大，但女社员们穿着棕衣都很早下田。许多女社员还和男社员竞赛。女社员郑宝金在竞赛中翻土的速度还跑在她男人的前头。
    有一次，他听说王原头生产队无论生产和工作都落了后，就冒着连绵春雨来到这里落户。一路上他边走边检查生产情况。看到地里小麦已经黄熟了还未收割；插秧季节快到，田里的土还没有翻好；山边杂草也没有锄光劈净。詹基燮晚上便召集干部开个座谈会，问他们为什么会有这种情况。干部埋怨群众“落后”，他边听心里边想，党一再教导我们说，没有落后的群众，只有落后的领导。群众生产搞不好主要是干部工作没有做好。他决定深入到群众中细致了解一下。他把铺盖搬到贫农积极分子王荣柱家里，和王荣柱同桌吃饭，一起下田，晚上收工回来挑水替王荣柱浇菜，清早起来扫地，没有几天就同王荣柱相处得亲如弟兄，无话不谈。詹基燮问王荣柱生产为什么搞不好，社员的意见怎样？王荣柱就把社员们和他自己的看法原原本本讲出来。主要问题是生产队长在生产上虽然带头，但是抓生活没有抓好，工作任务来了不充分发动群众，有的干部很少参加生产。少数富裕中农不愿意搞农业生产跑出去搞私人副业。情况摸清楚了，詹基燮就召开干部会，把工作中存在的问题摊开来。他肯定了生产队长王有熙积极带头参加生产的一面，号召大家向他学习，也批评了他不关心生活，不注意工作方法的一面。对其他干部的缺点，他也进行了耐心的教育，同时详细研究了改进工作的办法。并且根据广大社员的要求，通过说理辩论，坚决制止少数富裕中农的资本主义活动。问题基本解决了，但是詹基燮并没有立刻离开这个生产队，他每天参加生产，以自己的模范行动教育影响干部和群众。干部们眼看党支部书记天天到田里跟社员一起劳动，也分头下田，到生产现场去领导生产。社员们看到干部都下田了，劳动热情高涨，特别是妇女参加劳动的人数由原来的十多人增加到三十五人，三十多亩黄熟小麦在一天中就全部抢收回来了。早稻插秧提前十天结束，种植面积比去年扩大了一倍，夺得全大队早稻扩种的红旗。这时，詹基燮又大抓生活，到食堂去当了三十多天的炊事员，跟炊事员一起工作，一起商量改进的办法。每天三顿给社员端饭送菜，宣传公共食堂的优越性，发动社员搞家底生产。他自己带头起早摸黑和社员一起开荒，种了十五亩蔬菜
  （每人平均有一分五厘），还跑了二十六里山路到县里购买小猪和鸭苗，养了二十五头猪和一百二十多只鸡鸭。食堂的家底建立起来了，膳食大大改善，吃到二菜一汤，社员们都愿意到食堂来吃。现在这个生产队生产搞得好，生活也搞得好，由落后队一跃而为先进队。
    十年来，詹基燮一直保持了艰苦朴素、勤俭持家的作风。他一家七口人，只他一个全劳力和他的爱人半劳力参加劳动。公社化前一个半劳力负担这七口之家生活是会比较困难的。但由于他节省俭用，年年还有些余钱，没有超支过一回。国家和公社奖给他个人的奖品和奖金，他全部交给大队作为公共财产。
    在詹基燮的积极带动和影响下，园溪大队的党员、干部和社员都是满腔热情地参加生产领导生产，因而全队生产和各项工作都做得很出色，使一个“穷山沟”变成了“富粮仓”。去年粮食总产量比1949年增长近二倍半，每人平均有粮食一千零四十斤，生产总值比1949年增长三倍半，每户平均收入七百多元，户户社员有存款，每年还支援国家大批粮食和木材。　　　　　　　　　叶光辉
