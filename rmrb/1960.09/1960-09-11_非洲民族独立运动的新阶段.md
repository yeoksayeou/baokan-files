    New Stage of the African National Independence Movement
    Shi Dongfang

    The people of African countries are striding forward from colonial status towards the path of national independence. Before the Bandung Conference in 1955, there were only five independent countries in Africa, but now there are twenty-four independent countries. Especially this year, in the context of the overall upsurge of the national independence movement, a series of newly independent countries have been born in Africa. In January, Cameroon declared independence; in April, French Togoland declared independence; in June, British Somaliland, the Mali Federation, Madagascar, and the Belgian Congo declared independence; in July, Italian Somaliland; in August, four countries in French West Africa, namely Dahomey, Niger, Upper Volta, and Ivory Coast, and four countries in French Equatorial Africa, namely Chad, the Central African Republic, Middle Congo, and Gabon, successively declared independence. In October this year, Nigeria, the most populous country in Africa, will also move towards independence. By the end of this year, it is expected that the number of independent countries in Africa will increase to twenty-six, with a population accounting for three-quarters of Africa's total population of over 244 million; and an area accounting for two-thirds of Africa's total area of 30 million square kilometers. The number of countries declaring independence in less than a year is unprecedented in African history. The increase in newly independent countries has pushed the African national independence movement to a higher stage.

    Now, the national independence movement has swept across the entire African continent. There is not a single piece of land on the African continent that is not burning under the feet of imperialists and colonialists.

    In North Africa, the heroic Algerian people have persisted in their just armed struggle for the sixth year. The Algerian People's Armed Forces have continuously developed and grown stronger in the struggle, inflicting increasingly heavy blows on the French colonialists. From the beginning of this year to the end of August, more than 30,000 French colonial troops were annihilated on the Algerian battlefield, bringing the total number of French troops annihilated in the past five years to nearly 250,000. The Algerian National Liberation Army, equipped with modern equipment, frequently breaks through the "Maurice Line," which the French colonialists boasted as a "natural barrier," and increasingly gains the initiative on the battlefield, putting the French colonial army in an increasingly passive and overwhelmed predicament.

    In East Africa, the struggle launched by the people of Kenya against the "Macleod Plan" concocted by the British colonialists continues to develop. Mass protest rallies are often attended by tens of thousands of people. The vast number of farmers in Kenya cannot tolerate the heavy taxes imposed by the colonial authorities and have continuously held riots in May this year. The general strike held by 12,000 postal and telecommunications workers in Tanganyika in December last year continued until mid-February this year. Before the postal and telecommunications workers' strike ended, 10,000 railway workers in Tanganyika launched a new strike on February 8. In Uganda, the struggle against exorbitant taxes and levies, which began at the beginning of this year, has been constantly erupting, severely impacting British colonial rule.

    In Central Africa, the people of Southern and Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland continue their unyielding struggle against the Central African Federation imposed on them by the British colonialists. In Salisbury and Bulawayo, the two largest cities in Southern Rhodesia, tens of thousands of Africans have continuously held demonstrations and strikes since the beginning of this year, and even fought with colonial military police with stones. In Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland, the masses have continuously launched protest demonstrations to oppose the activities of the "Monckton Commission" dispatched by the British government in Central Africa.

    In South Africa and West Africa, the struggle of the local people to strive for national independence and oppose racial discrimination is surging. Following the large-scale demonstration movement in Durban Harbor in June last year, the South African people launched a vigorous struggle centered on opposing the "Pass Laws" in March this year, the scale and momentum of which were unprecedented.

    Even in areas where the national independence movement had been relatively silent for a long time, unrest has now begun. In South West Africa, which is under the rule of the South African Federation, local Africans have also launched a struggle against racial segregation. Even in Portuguese Angola, Mozambique, and Guinea, which have always been called the "silent" regions of Africa, the struggle for national independence has made great progress this year. In northern Angola, there have been people's armed forces resisting colonial rule. Looking across the African continent, from Algiers to Cape Town, from Nairobi to Freetown, the raging fire of anti-colonialism has spread everywhere!

    The main characteristics of the current African national independence movement are: First, the struggles of the people of various countries are mass-based and nationwide, with more and more workers, peasants, and youth joining the ranks of the struggle, prompting the deepening of the African anti-colonialist and anti-imperialist national independence movement.

    Second, because imperialism has never been willing to withdraw from the African stage, and has intensified its armed suppression, the African people have increasingly clearly realized that the Algerian people's nearly six-year-long armed struggle is a "living symbol" of the African people's struggle for liberation. Under the influence and encouragement of the Algerian national liberation war, the people of the Congo and Cameroon are waging armed struggles against the Belgian and French colonial troops. The people of the South African Federation have also begun to use violent means of struggle. In Angola, Mauritania, Chad, and Kenya, there are also small-scale armed struggles.

    Third, in the struggle against imperialism and for national independence, the unity of the African people is constantly strengthening, and they have formed a situation of mutual support and cooperation in the struggle. At the beginning of last year, the large-scale anti-colonialist struggles launched by the people of the Congo and Nyasaland and other regions stimulated and supported each other with the anti-imperialist struggles in other regions of Black Africa. In July this year, the struggle launched by the Congolese people to safeguard national independence and sovereignty also triggered chain reactions in Southern Rhodesia, Angola, Ruanda-Urundi and other places. The Second All-African People's Conference held in Tunis in February this year, the Second Asian-African People's Solidarity Conference held in Conakry in April, and the two conferences of African independent countries held in Addis Ababa in June and Leopoldville in August, all reflected the desire of the African people to strengthen unity and jointly oppose imperialism.

    Fourth, the African people's demand for complete national independence is becoming increasingly resolute. In countries that have already gained independence, the struggle to get rid of imperialist economic control, withdraw foreign troops, and abolish foreign military bases is also developing further. In particular, the Republic of Guinea, after getting rid of the shackles of colonialism, has taken a series of measures to safeguard and develop national independence: dismissing colonial officers, regaining control of foreign trade and domestic commerce from the colonialists, and implementing currency reform... After independence, the government and people of Guinea resolutely carried out arduous struggles to eliminate the political and economic forces of imperialism and colonialism, thus setting a brilliant example for the African national independence movement.

    The imperialist colonial system in Africa is now shaking across the board, and it is accelerating through the inevitable historical process of complete collapse and disintegration. However, this does not mean that imperialism will disappear on its own. Imperialism will never automatically withdraw from African colonies, and they are making frantic dying struggles in Africa. Bloody armed suppression has always been a major means for imperialism to deal with the colonial people. There is no need to talk about distant facts, but in this year alone, imperialism has been carrying out brutal armed suppression in various regions of East Africa, North Africa, Central Africa, West Africa, and South Africa without exception.

    In Uganda in East Africa, in January this year, Britain concentrated more than 1,000 troops to suppress Africans who launched a tax resistance struggle, killing 15 Africans and arresting more than 1,500 people. In July this year, a large number of British military police carried out frenzied "sweeping" activities on 2,000 square miles of land in Kenya. In the "Central African Federation," after the British colonialists brutally suppressed the Nyasaland people's uprising last year, they continued to suppress Africans this year. In July this year, the authorities in Southern Rhodesia mobilized several battalions of colonial troops and sent armored vehicles to open fire on thousands of African demonstrators, killing at least twelve Africans and arresting more than 400 people. In Northern Rhodesia, white people organized "self-defense forces," and Britain sent reinforcements to the northern region to carry out suppression activities. In one persecution, more than 100 African demonstrators were arrested. The persecution activities in the British dominion of the South African Federation are even more rampant. Since the declaration of a "state of emergency" in March this year, more than 1,900 "political prisoners" and more than 20,000 Africans have been imprisoned in concentration camps. In Portuguese Africa, the Portuguese colonialists are taking suppression measures, constantly sending more naval, land, and air forces to Portuguese African colonies. Recently, 2,000 people were reinforced in Portuguese Guinea. In June this year, a so-called "special expedition team" was also reinforced in Angola. In Algeria and Cameroon, the millions of troops of the French colonialists continue to carry out shocking bloody massacres.

    While carrying out armed suppression, the imperialist colonialists also hypocritically pretend to be willing to "bestow" "independence" on the colonial people, attempting to paralyze the revolutionary will of the African colonial people and weaken or even eliminate the African national independence movement. In the current situation of the continuous upsurge of the African national independence movement, imperialism is generally adopting this deceptive means of retreating in order to advance. British imperialism is desperately peddling quack medicines such as "constitutional reform" and "racial partnership" in Central and East Africa; French imperialism still stubbornly clings to its "French Community." Other old colonial countries are also playing or will play more of these tricks. Diallo, Secretary-General of the All-African People's Conference, sharply exposed the two-pronged approach of imperialism in dealing with the African colonial people: armed suppression and deception. He pointed out: "The colonialists have not disarmed, they are trying their best to maintain their position by all means, strengthen suppression and apply all kinds of deceptive tricks... They are trying to eat fish without getting their hands smelly, and trying to make independence lose its revolutionary content."

    The recent facts of the joint suppression and intervention of the Congolese people's struggle by imperialism headed by the United States have completely exposed the bandit nature of the imperialists. It tells the African people that they must not have any unrealistic illusions about imperialism and colonialism. At the same time, the Congo incident clearly tells the African people that the American imperialism, which is accustomed to wearing the cloak of so-called "anti-colonialism," is the common, most vicious, and most dangerous enemy of the African people. American imperialism, styling itself as the "world police," supports colonial countries everywhere in the bloody suppression of the African colonial people. Everyone knows that it is the number one accomplice of the French colonialists in massacring the Algerian people; it is the mastermind of this joint imperialist intervention in the Congolese national independence movement. American imperialism is now colluding with other imperialist countries to intensify its vicious conspiracy to divide and jointly manage the Congo through the United Nations.

    Now, the UN forces manipulated by the United States are infringing on the sovereignty of the Congo and interfering in the internal affairs of the Congo. The UN forces have forcibly occupied the Congolese airport, forcibly occupied the Congolese national radio station, sheltered the Belgian colonialists and the Tshombe separatist group, and arrogantly obstructed the Congolese government from exercising its sovereignty. There have even been incidents of UN forces massacring Congolese people. The American ruling group is cheering for its scheme of using the United Nations to promote "Africans fighting Africans." The "New York Times" on September 3 raved triumphantly that the people who killed the Congolese were "a unit of Africans, which makes it impossible for African racists to use this incident to oppose Europeans." Former US Ambassador to the United Nations Lodge also boasted that the US's means of using the United Nations to invade the Congo was "the most advanced and most mature international effort in history." Precisely because of this, American imperialism is trying to apply the vicious means it is using in the Congo to the invasion of the entire Africa. US Senator Mansfield on August 29 vigorously advocated that "the entire African continent should be regarded as a no-man's land under the supervision of the United Nations."

    American imperialism is currently invading Africa on a large scale from all aspects of politics, economy, military, and culture. With one hand, it is trying to strangle the African national independence movement; with the other, it is trying to squeeze out the forces of old colonial countries such as Britain and France, and replace them in Africa. In June this year, US Assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs Satterthwaite openly admitted: "We (the United States) have made a big bet in Africa." He described Africa as a "huge vacuum," and the "task" of American imperialism is to "fill" this so-called "vacuum." Recently, US presidential candidates Nixon and Kennedy have also clearly announced the aggressive ambitions of American imperialism towards Africa. As pointed out by a recent issue of the Congolese "Liberation" weekly, "No matter what methods the United States adopts, it cannot conceal its ambition to annex the Congo, or even annex the entire Africa." The Congolese "Liberation" weekly clearly wrote that American imperialism is "the most vicious, most insidious, and most greedy colonialist." Therefore, the African national independence movement today not only still faces the serious threat of old colonial countries, but also faces the serious threat of a more vicious and more insidious neo-colonialist - American imperialism.

    In summary, the current situation is very favorable for the struggle of the African people against imperialism and colonialism and for the struggle to strive for and safeguard national independence. Although the road of struggle facing the African people is still long-term, arduous, and tortuous, with the support of socialist countries and with the support of the people of the world, as long as the African people unite more closely and strengthen the joint struggle against imperialism and colonialism, final victory will surely belong to the African people!

    非洲民族独立运动的新阶段	史东方
    非洲各国人民正在大踏步地从殖民地地位向着民族独立的道路迈进。1955年万隆会议以前，非洲只有五个独立国家，而现在已有二十四个国家独立。特别是今年，在民族独立运动全面高涨的形势下，非洲诞生了一系列新独立的国家。1月，喀麦隆宣告了独立；4月，法属多哥宣告了独立；6月，英属索马里兰、马里联邦、马尔加什、比属刚果宣告了独立；7月，意属索马里兰，8月，法属西非的达荷美、尼日尔、上沃尔特和象牙海岸等四国，以及法属赤道非洲的乍得、中非共和国、中央刚果和加蓬等四国纷纷宣告独立。今年10月，非洲人口最多的一个国家尼日利亚也将走向独立。到今年年底，预计非洲独立国家将能增至二十六个，这些国家的人口占非洲总人口二亿四千四百余万人的四分之三；面积占非洲总面积三千万平方公里的三分之二。在不到一年之内，宣告独立国家之多，是非洲历史上空前的。而新的独立国家的增多，又把非洲民族独立运动推向更高的阶段。
    现在，民族独立运动已经席卷了整个非洲。在非洲大陆上已经没有一块土地不在帝国主义和殖民者的脚下燃烧起来。
    在北非，英勇的阿尔及利亚人民坚持正义的武装斗争已经跨入了第六个年头。阿尔及利亚人民武装力量在斗争中不断发展壮大，给予法国殖民者越来越沉重的打击。从今年年初到8月底，法国殖民军在阿尔及利亚战场上被歼灭三万多人，连同过去五年法军被歼灭的人数，总计将近二十五万人。具有现代化装备的阿尔及利亚民族解放军经常突破被法国殖民者吹嘘为“天险”的“莫里斯防线”，越来越大地掌握战场上的主动权，使法国殖民军队日益陷于被动和招架不及的困境。
    在东非，怯尼亚人民掀起的反对英国殖民者策划的“麦克劳德计划”的斗争，继续发展着。群众性的抗议集会动辄以万人计。怯尼亚的广大农民也不能忍受殖民当局的繁重捐税，在今年5月间不断举行暴动。坦噶尼喀的一万二千名邮电工人在去年12月间举行的总罢工，一直延续到今年2月中旬。邮电工人的罢工尚未结束，坦噶尼喀一万名铁路工人又于2月8日掀起了新的罢工斗争。在乌干达，反抗苛捐杂税的斗争从今年年初开始以来，一直是此伏彼起，剧烈地冲击着英国的殖民统治。
    在中非，南、北罗得西亚和尼亚萨兰人民为反对英国殖民者强加在他们身上的中非联邦继续进行着不屈不挠的斗争。在南罗得西亚的最大的两个城市——索耳兹伯里和布拉瓦约，成千上万的非洲人今年以来不断举行示威、罢工，甚至用石头同殖民军警展开搏斗。在北罗得西亚和尼亚萨兰，群众连续掀起抗议示威，以反对英国政府派遣的“蒙克顿委员会”在中非进行的活动。
    在南非和西非，当地人民争取民族独立和反对种族歧视的斗争，汹涌澎湃。南非人民继去年6月德班港的大示威运动之后，在今年3月间又掀起了一个以反“通行证法”为中心的反抗种族歧视制度的轰轰烈烈的斗争，其规模和声势都是前所未有的。
    即使是过去长时期内民族独立运动较为沉寂的地区，现在也开始动荡起来了。在南非联邦统治下的西南非洲，当地非洲人也展开了反对种族隔离的斗争。甚至在一向被称为非洲“沉默”地区的葡属安哥拉、莫三鼻给和几内亚，争取民族独立的斗争在今年也有了很大的发展。在安哥拉的北部，已经出现了反抗殖民统治的人民武装。放眼遍看非洲大陆，从阿尔及尔到开普敦，从内罗毕到佛利敦，已经燃遍了反殖民主义的熊熊烈火！
    当前非洲民族独立运动的主要特点是：一、各国人民的斗争带有群众性和全民性，越来越多的工人、农民和青年投入到斗争的行列去，促使非洲反殖民主义、反帝国主义的民族独立运动深刻化。
    二、由于帝国主义从来不甘心退出非洲舞台，而变本加厉地进行武装镇压，非洲人民日益清楚地认识到，阿尔及利亚人民坚持将近六年的武装斗争，是非洲人民争取解放的“活生生的象征”。在阿尔及利亚民族解放战争的影响和鼓舞下，刚果和喀麦隆人民正在同比利时和法国殖民军队进行武装斗争。南非联邦人民也开始使用暴力斗争的手段。在安哥拉、毛里塔尼亚、乍得和怯尼亚，也都存在着小规模的武装斗争。
    三、在反对帝国主义和争取民族独立的斗争中，非洲各国人民的团结正在不断增强，他们在斗争中形成了互相支持和配合的局面。去年年初，刚果和尼亚萨兰等地人民掀起的大规模的反殖民主义斗争，和黑非洲其他地区的反帝斗争相互激发，相互支持。今年7月间，刚果人民掀起的维护民族独立和主权的斗争，在南罗得西亚、安哥拉、卢安达—乌隆迪等地也激起了连锁反应。今年2月在突尼斯召开的第二届全非人民大会、4月在科纳克里举行的第二届亚非人民团结大会和6月在亚的斯亚贝巴、8月在利奥波德维尔召开的两次非洲独立国家会议，都反映了非洲各国人民要求加强团结，共同反对帝国主义的愿望。
    四、非洲人民实现彻底民族独立的要求日益坚决。在已经获得独立的国家，要求摆脱帝国主义经济控制、撤退外国军队和取消外国军事基地的斗争也正在进一步的发展。特别是几内亚共和国，在摆脱了殖民主义的枷锁以后，采取了一系列维护和发展民族独立的措施：撤销了殖民军官的职务，从殖民者手中夺回了对外贸易和国内商业的控制权，实行了币制改革……。几内亚政府和人民在独立以后，坚决为肃清帝国主义和殖民主义的政治经济势力进行了艰巨的斗争，从而为非洲民族独立运动树立了一个光辉的榜样。
    帝国主义在非洲的殖民体系现在已经全线动摇，它正在加速地经历着全面崩溃和瓦解的不可避免的历史过程。但是，这决不是说，帝国主义将会自行消亡。帝国主义是绝不会自动退出非洲殖民地的，它们正在非洲作疯狂的垂死挣扎。血腥的武装镇压，始终是帝国主义对付殖民地人民的一个主要手段。久远的事实不必说了，就拿今年来说，帝国主义在东非、北非、中非、西非和南非各个地区仍然毫无例外地进行着残暴的武装镇压。
    在东非的乌干达，今年1月间，英国就集中一千多名军队对展开抗税斗争的非洲人进行了镇压，有十五个非洲人被打死，一千五百多人被捕。今年7月间，大批英国军警在怯尼亚的二千平方哩的土地上进行了疯狂的“扫荡”活动。在“中非联邦”，英国殖民者继去年残酷镇压尼亚萨兰人民起义之后，今年仍不停地对非洲人进行镇压。今年7月，南罗得西亚当局就调动了好几营殖民军队，并出动装甲车对几千名非洲示威者开枪，至少有十二名非洲人被打死，有四百多人被捕。在北罗得西亚，白种人组织了“自卫队”，英国曾派增援部队到北部地区进行镇压活动。在一次迫害中，有一百多名非洲示威者被捕。在英国自治领南非联邦的迫害活动更加猖狂。自今年3月“紧急状态”宣布以来就有一千九百多名“政治犯”和两万多名非洲人被关进集中营。在葡属非洲，葡萄牙殖民者正在采取镇压措施，不断地增派海陆空军到葡属非洲殖民地去。最近在葡属几内亚就增援了二千人。今年6月间，在安哥拉还增派了一个所谓“特别讨伐队”。而在阿尔及利亚和喀麦隆，法国殖民者的成百万军队继续进行着骇人听闻的血腥大屠杀。
    在武装镇压的同时，帝国主义殖民者还假惺惺地伪装愿意“恩赐”殖民地人民以“独立”，企图麻痹非洲殖民地人民的革命意志，削弱以至取消非洲的民族独立运动。在目前非洲民族独立运动不断高涨的形势下，帝国主义正在普遍地采取这种以退为进的欺骗手段。英国帝国主义在中非和东非正在拚命兜售“宪法改革”、“种族合伙”等狗皮膏药；法国帝国主义仍然死抱住它的“法兰西共同体”不放。其它老牌殖民国家也正在或者将更多地玩弄这种骗局。全非人民大会秘书长迪亚洛就曾尖锐地揭露了帝国主义对付非洲殖民地人民的两手：即武装镇压和欺骗。他指出：“殖民主义者并没有解除武装，他们极力想用一切手段维持自己的地位，加强镇压和施用种种骗人的伎俩……他们企图吃鱼不沾腥气，企图使独立失去革命的内容。”
    最近发生的以美国为首的帝国主义联合镇压和干涉刚果人民斗争的事实，彻底地暴露了帝国主义者的强盗本相。它告诉非洲人民，绝不能对帝国主义和殖民主义者抱有任何不切实际的幻想。同时，刚果事件更清楚地告诉非洲人民，惯于披上所谓“反殖民主义”外衣的美帝国主义，是非洲各国人民的共同的最凶恶、最危险的敌人。美帝国主义以“世界宪兵”自居，到处支持殖民国家对非洲殖民地人民的血腥镇压。谁都知道，它是法国殖民者屠杀阿尔及利亚人民的头号帮凶；是这一次帝国主义联合干涉刚果民族独立运动的主谋。美帝国主义现在正伙同其它帝国主义国家加紧利用联合国进行着瓜分和共管刚果的恶毒阴谋。
    现在美国操纵下的联合国军，正在刚果侵犯刚果的主权，干涉刚果的内政。联合国军强占刚果机场，强占刚果的国家电台，庇护比利时殖民者和冲伯分裂集团，蛮横地阻挠刚果政府行使它的主权。甚至已经发生了联合国军惨杀刚果人的事件。美国统治集团正为它利用联合国推行“用非洲人打非洲人”的计谋叫好。9月3日的“纽约时报”得意忘形地嚷道，打死刚果人的是“一支非洲人的部队，这就使得非洲的种族主义者无法利用这件事来反对欧洲人了。”前美国驻联合国代表洛奇也曾经把美国利用联合国侵略刚果的手段吹嘘为“有史以来最先进、最成熟的国际努力”。正因为这样，美帝国主义企图把它正在刚果使用的恶毒手段用之于对整个非洲的侵略。美国参议员曼斯菲尔德8月29日就大肆鼓吹要把“整个非洲大陆看作是联合国监督下的无人地带”。
    美帝国主义目前正从政治、经济、军事、文化等各个方面大举侵入非洲，它一只手企图扼杀非洲的民族独立运动；一只手则力图排挤掉英法等那些老牌殖民国家的势力，而取代它们在非洲的地位。今年6月间，美国负责非洲事务的助理国务卿萨脱斯威脱公开承认：“我们（美国）在非洲下了很大的赌注”。他把非洲说成是一个“巨大的真空”，而美帝国主义的“任务”，就是要“填补”这个所谓“真空”。最近，美国竞选总统的候选人尼克松和肯尼迪，也都明白地宣布了美帝国主义对于非洲的侵略野心。正如9月的一期刚果“解放”周刊所指出，“不管美国采取何种手法，也丝毫不能掩盖它企图侵吞刚果，甚至侵吞整个非洲的野心。”刚果“解放”周刊明确地写道：美帝国主义是“最凶恶、最阴险和最贪婪的殖民主义者。”因此，非洲民族独立运动今天不仅仍然面临着老牌殖民国家的严重威胁，而且更面临着一个更加凶恶、更加阴险的新殖民主义者——美国帝国主义的严重威胁。
    总起来说，目前的形势对于非洲各国人民反对帝国主义、殖民主义，争取和维护民族独立的斗争，是非常有利的。尽管摆在非洲各国人民面前的斗争道路仍然是长期的、艰巨的和曲折的，但是，在社会主义国家的支持下，在全世界人民的支持下，只要非洲人民更加紧密地团结起来，加强反对帝国主义和殖民主义的联合斗争，最后胜利是一定属于非洲人民的！（附图片）
