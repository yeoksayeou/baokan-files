In the Qianwei Management Area of the Dajie Commune in Yuxi County, whenever Zhang Qiwu of the purchasing and marketing store is mentioned, people unanimously call him a "good cadre who cares about three aspects (production, the collective, and the masses), and an excellent agricultural tool doctor."

Zhang Qiwu's job is to promote new agricultural tools, but he does much more than that. At first, he didn't understand the use, maintenance, disassembly, and other techniques of agricultural tools, and encountered many difficulties. But he believed: Where there is a will, there is a way. He was determined to study the technology diligently. Whenever he had time, he would disassemble double-wheeled double-share plows, new-style walking plows, threshing machines, etc., one by one, observe them carefully, compare them, and remember the position of each part and screw, then reassemble them piece by piece. After repeated disassembly and assembly, in a few days, he finally understood the structure and performance of various agricultural tools. To learn how to use them, he took people as teachers and moved the new agricultural tools to the fields, working hard to learn. Once he mastered the technology, he often carried a "service bag," with pliers, oil, various small and large parts of agricultural tools, and a notebook, and patrolled the teams and fields to repair agricultural tools for the commune members.

Once, Zhang Qiwu passed through the eighth production team of the Lejiaying Management Area and saw six walking plows left unused in the field. He stopped to check them one by one and found that the plows had problems. He immediately took out tools and parts to repair them, and after repairing them, he continued on his way. Before long, the people plowing the field returned and saw that the broken tools had been repaired and were easy to use. That day, this plowing team overfulfilled the plowing task assigned by the team.

Not long ago, he went to the twelfth and thirteenth production teams of the Lejiaying Management Area to repair agricultural tools and found that some of the new agricultural tools had not been taken back and were placed on the ridges of the fields. A double-wheeled double-share plow and a walking plow had already rusted and were damaged. He thought: If we use them and don't care for them, what will happen when we need to use them later? On the way home, he made a special survey in three production teams and found similar phenomena in all of them. He reported these situations to the Party branch. Based on his suggestions, the branch mobilized the masses to carry out a major inspection of agricultural tools, recovered forty-one new agricultural tools left on the ridges of the fields, cleaned them all, sent them to the agricultural tool storage room, and also established a storage system.

    出色的“农具医生”
    玉溪县大街公社前卫管理区，一提到购销店的张其文，人们都异口同声地称他是“三面关心（关心生产、集体、群众）的好干部，出色的农具医生”。
    张其文的工作是负责推广新式农具，可是他做的却比这多得多。开初，他不懂农具的使用、检修、拆卸等技术，碰到了不少困难。但是他相信：有志者事竟成。他下定决心钻研技术。一有空，他就把双轮双铧犁、新式步犁、打谷机等一件一件拆开，仔细观察，比较，记清每个零件和大小螺丝钉的位置，然后又一件一件地安装还原。这样反复拆卸、安装，几天的工夫，他终于弄清了各种农具的结构、性能。为了学会使用，他拜人为师，把新式农具搬到田间，勤学苦练。他学会了技术，便经常背起“服务包”，带上搬钳、机油、各种农具的大小零件、笔记本，巡回到队、到田，给社员检修农具。
    有一次张其文路过乐家营管理区第八生产队，看见田里摆着六张步犁没有用，他便停下来一一进行检查，发现步犁有毛病，他马上掏出工具、零件修理，修好以后，又继续赶路。不一会，犁田的人转来，看到坏了的农具已经修好，用起来也很轻便。这一天，这个犁田小组超额完成了队上交给的犁田任务。
    不久前，他去乐家营管理区第十二、十三生产队检修农具，发现有一部分新式农具没有收回，摆在田埂上，有一部双轮双铧犁和一张步犁已经生锈坏了。他想：用过不管，以后要用怎么办呢？在回家的路上，他又专门在三个生产队作了调查，发现都有类似现象。他就把这些情况向党支部作了汇报。支部根据他的建议，发动群众开展了农具大检查，收回了摆在田埂上的四十一部新式农具，全部进行擦洗，送进农具保管室，还建立了保管制度。（附图片）
