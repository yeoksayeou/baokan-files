    External First, Internal Second; Others First, Self Second
    The word "style" is increasingly attracting people's attention. When a unit or an individual handles a matter, they promote putting the external before the internal, others before self; giving convenience to others, leaving difficulties to themselves, demonstrating a communist style. Therefore, people naturally praise and admire them from the bottom of their hearts.
    Objective reality requires that everything starts from the overall situation, at all times from the overall situation, requires mutual cooperation, and promotes the communist spirit. Therefore, "style" becomes an important basis for people to measure and evaluate things. The level of people's communist ideology and morality also reflects whether the relationship between people, between enterprises, and between regions is close and seamless. Ma Xueli, an advanced pacesetter in Hubei Province, steps up when there are difficulties, yields when there are honors, learns from the advanced, and helps the backward; Zhao Mengtao, a female textile worker in Xi'an, helps others catch up with herself, all are manifestations of noble style. The news of Hunan Province's vigorous efforts to export raw coal published in today's newspaper is another brand-new example. Hunan Province originally did not have many coal enterprises, and the output was not large. In recent years, new iron and steel enterprises have been built, and their own coal consumption is also very large. However, they did not only look at themselves, regardless of the overall situation; they still transferred a large amount of good coal to other provinces to support fraternal units and fraternal provinces. This noble style of putting the external before the internal and others before self deserves great praise.
    Hunan Province's style is not only because they have achieved external first, internal second, and others first, self second in transportation, but also because they try their best to export good coal, especially coking coal needed by the iron and steel industry, and leave the inferior coal for their own use. In this way, every ton of coal they export ensures that the coal-using unit actually uses a ton, which greatly saves the country's transportation capacity and is conducive to the entire increase production and practice economy campaign.
    Currently, the increase production and practice economy campaign is in full swing in various places, and all walks of life need coal, while the iron and steel industry needs even more. In order to meet the needs of steel production, all areas that produce coal and can export it should try to export as much coal as possible to other places, and export more good coal to railway trunk lines; the coal needed locally should be used as much as possible from small kilns, and coal mining enterprises themselves should use more low-quality coal. To achieve this, it is necessary to promote the spirit of cooperation, be selfless, and put others before self, just like Hunan.

### 先外后内　先人后己

    先外后内　先人后己
    “风格”这个词儿，越来越引起人们的注意。一个单位一个人在处理一件事情上，发扬了先外后内，先人后己；把方便让给别人，把困难留给自己的共产主义风格，所以，人们就很自然地传颂不已，衷心敬慕。
    客观实际要求事事从整体出发，时时从整体出发，要求彼此相互协作，发扬共产主义精神。所以，“风格”，就成为人们衡量与品评事物的重要依据。人们的共产主义思想和道德水准的高低，也反映了人与人、企业与企业、地区与地区之间的关系是否亲密无间。湖北省的先进标兵马学礼，见困难就上，见荣誉就让，见先进就学，见后进就帮；西安市纺织女工赵梦桃帮助别人赶上自己，都是高尚风格的表现。今天本报发表的湖南省大抓原煤外调的消息，又是一个崭新的例证。湖南省原有的煤炭企业就不多，产量也不算大，近年来又新建了钢铁企业，自己的用煤量也很大。然而，他们没有只看自己，不顾大局；仍然把大量的好煤调到省外去，支援兄弟单位、兄弟省份。这种先外后内、先人后己的高尚风格值得大大赞扬。
    湖南省的风格还不只是因为他们在调运上做到了先外后内、先人后己，而且把好煤、特别是钢铁工业需要的焦煤都尽量外调，留下次煤给自己用。这样，他们外调一吨煤就保证用煤单位实实在在用一吨，大大节省了国家的运输力，有利于整个增产节约运动。
    目前，各地增产节约运动正在轰轰烈烈地进行，各行各业都需用煤炭，而钢铁工业的需要量则更大。为了满足钢铁生产的需要，凡是生产煤炭而又可以外调的地区，都应当尽量多向外地调煤，并且多调好煤到铁路干线上去；本地需用的煤炭，应当尽量用小窑煤，煤矿企业本身的用煤更应该多用劣质煤。为了做到这一点，又必须像湖南那样大兴协作之风，大公无私，先人后己。
