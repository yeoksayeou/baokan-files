(Reported by this newspaper) The 13,000-plus rural work cadres of the Xiangxi Tujia and Miao Autonomous Prefecture in Hunan Province, while eating, living, working, and consulting with the masses, resolutely implement the Party's class policy in rural areas, broadly befriending poor and lower-middle peasants. They adopt methods such as holding discussion meetings and paying door-to-door visits to listen to the opinions of poor and lower-middle peasants, relying on them to lead the masses in generating ideas and finding solutions, tapping potential, adding measures, and increasing drive, resulting in a new situation in production.

This spring, the Xiangxi Tujia and Miao Autonomous Prefecture Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, based on a systematic summary of past production experiences, put forward the call to expand the planting of "three early" (early corn, early rice, early miscellaneous grains) crops to increase grain production at high speed, requiring cadres at all levels to carry forward the fine style of work from the land reform period, resolutely eat, live, work, and consult with the masses, especially taking root and settling down among the poor and lower-middle peasants, sharing their breath and destiny, and making two or three close friends each. Party secretaries and the vast number of cadres at all levels responded enthusiastically to the call of the Prefectural Committee and went to the homes of poor and lower-middle peasants to settle down. More than 90% of the rural cadres in the prefecture lived in the homes of poor peasants. More than 150 county and commune Party secretaries and members in Luxi County made more than 500 close friends among poor peasants. Wherever the class policy is well implemented, the enthusiasm of the masses becomes greater and greater, and the face of production changes rapidly. In June, the Prefectural Committee again mobilized cadres at all levels to systematically summarize the experience of implementing the "four togethers" with the masses from the bottom up, and decided to hold 10,000 discussion meetings in the prefecture, mainly with poor and lower-middle peasants, to mobilize them to raise problems, think of solutions, break through difficulties, and increase drive to strive for a new level of summer production. Because the cadres were able to listen to the opinions of the masses with a sincere attitude and humility, many problems were solved easily. Luxi County held more than 1,400 discussion meetings, and the masses raised more than 20,000 opinions. The county Party committee and the commune Party committees then sorted and prioritized the opinions of the masses, determined which should be handled first and which should be handled later, and then mobilized the masses to discuss them, which satisfied the masses very much. They said: Everyone shares the burden of a thousand catties, and enthusiasm is even higher. In the mid-cultivation and topdressing, the county eliminated more than 70% of the third-class seedlings in just three days. Tian Guichu, deputy secretary of the Erjiahe Commune Party Committee in Dayong County, when holding a discussion meeting in the fifth production team of the Erjiahe Brigade, the old peasant Hu Yuqing and others raised two issues: First, the summer production tasks are heavy, and there is not enough labor for agriculture; second, although the rice seedlings this year are good, there is a lot of barnyard grass mixed in, which needs to be removed. In addition to immediately discussing with everyone that 80% of the labor force should be concentrated in this team for agricultural production, Comrade Tian Guichu also raised these opinions at the commune Party committee meeting. After research, the commune Party committee concentrated 75% of the elite troops and formed 635 combat groups to carry out field management and barnyard grass removal work. In two days, they carried out one mid-cultivation and topdressing of more than 30,000 mu of rice seedlings and completely eliminated the barnyard grass.

While holding discussion meetings in many places, cadres also established a system of dividing up and visiting commune members door-to-door. They set up opinion books and opinion boxes in various work groups and canteens to widely absorb the opinions of the masses. With the deepening implementation of the mass line, the cadres and the masses have become more enthusiastic and their fighting spirit has become stronger. The masses have reflected one after another: "The land reform cadres have come to the countryside again, the cadres and the masses are the same, we produce together and discuss together, and our enthusiasm is soaring."

    贯彻党在农村中的阶级政策　广泛与贫农下中农交朋友
    湘西自治州干部在群众中扎根落户
    本报讯　湖南省湘西土家族苗族自治州一万三千多农村工作干部，在与群众同吃、同住、同劳动、同商量中，坚决贯彻党在农村中的阶级政策，广泛与贫农、下中农交知心朋友。他们采取座谈会、登门访问等办法，倾听贫农、下中农的意见，依靠他们带动群众出主意、想办法，挖掘潜力，加措施，加干劲，使生产出现了新局面。
    今年春天，中共湘西土家族苗族自治州委员会在系统总结历年来生产经验的基础上，提出了扩种“三早”（早包谷、早稻、早杂粮）作物，高速度增产粮食的号召，要求各级干部发扬土地改革时的优良作风，坚决与群众同吃、同住、同劳动、同商量，特别是到贫农、下中农中间扎根落户，与他们同呼吸、共命运，每人交两、三个知心朋友。各级党委书记和广大干部热烈响应州委的号召，就纷纷到贫农、下中农家里去落户。全州90％以上的农村干部，都住到了贫农家里。泸溪县的一百五十多个县、公社党委书记和委员，共交了贫农知心朋友五百多人。凡是阶级政策贯彻执行得好的地方，群众干劲都越来越足，生产面貌都迅速改变。6月间，州委又发动各级干部，自下而上地系统地总结了与群众实行“四同”的经验，决定在全州召开一万次以贫农、下中农为主的座谈会，发动他们针对当前生产提问题、想办法、破难题、加干劲，争取夏季生产更上一层楼。由于干部都能本着诚恳的态度，虚心听取群众的意见，许多问题都迎刃而解。泸溪县召开了一千四百多次座谈会，群众共提出意见二万多条。县委和各公社党委又把群众的意见整理排队，确定哪些先办，哪些后办，然后再发动群众讨论，群众都十分满意。他们说：千斤担子大家挑，积极性更为高涨。在中耕追肥中，全县只三天时间，便把70％以上的三类苗消灭了。大庸县二家河公社党委副书记田桂初，在二家河大队第五生产队召开座谈会时，老农胡玉卿等提出两个问题：一是夏季生产任务重，搞农业的劳力不够，二是今年的禾苗虽好，但夹杂其中的稗子不少，需要除稗。田桂初同志除立即与大家商量，在这个队集中了80％的劳动力投入农业生产以外，并将这些意见提到公社党委会上进行了讨论。公社党委经过研究，集中了75％的精兵，组成了六百三十五个战斗组，进行田间管理和除稗工作，两天时间就对三万多亩禾苗，进行了一次中耕追肥，全部除尽了稗子。
    许多地方在召开座谈会的同时，干部还建立了分工登门访问社员的制度。他们在各个作业组、食堂设意见簿、意见箱，广泛吸收群众意见。随着群众路线的深入贯彻，干部和群众的干劲更足，斗志愈旺了。群众纷纷反映说：“土改干部又下乡，干部群众一个样，同生产，共商量，我们的干劲高万丈。”　　　　　　（陈咏初）（附图片）
