Harvest the autumn well, plant the wheat well.

To vigorously develop agriculture and vigorously develop grain production are long-term tasks, as well as urgent tasks, with distant goals and current goals. The distant goal is to thoroughly realize the modernization of agriculture and to greatly enrich agricultural products; the current goal is to ensure a relatively good autumn harvest this year and to strive for a summer harvest next year that is better than any in the past. "A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step." To achieve distant goals, we must earnestly do the current work well. An autumn harvest and an autumn planting, these two things determine the overall situation of the agricultural production front and the grain production front for the next two years. We must concentrate all the forces that can be concentrated to vigorously promote them, doing them quickly and well.

What does it mean to vigorously promote them? It means mobilizing the whole Party and the whole people, to harvest more and plant more, the more the better.

What does it mean to do them quickly and well? It means seizing the time, implementing them throughout, grasping the key points, and striving for perfection.

The autumn harvest must be large, good, and timely. This year, under the circumstances of severe and frequent natural disasters, great victories were achieved in spring sowing and summer sowing, and great victories were also achieved in field management. In the struggle against nature, commune members of rural people's communes, cadres at all levels, and personnel supporting agriculture from all aspects across the country have put in great efforts and paid a large amount of labor, planting more and more, managing more and more carefully; the purpose of all these efforts is to harvest more autumn grain and more industrial raw materials. Now, in vast areas, early autumn crops are being harvested, and the harvest of mid-autumn crops and late-autumn crops will also begin successively. To ensure a relatively good autumn harvest this year, in addition to continuing to strengthen the field management of late-autumn crops, the most important thing is to do a good job in the autumn harvest. This is the final moment to seize victory on the agricultural front this year. If the work of several months has been done very well, a few days or even a few hours of negligence during the harvest season can still result in significant losses. Since more effort has been put into planting and management than in previous years, we should strive to be more timely, more efficient, and more meticulous in harvesting than in previous years.

In the autumn harvest, it is required to tightly grasp every crop and not relax on any of them. The primary task is to grasp all kinds of grain crops, attaching great importance to staple foods, miscellaneous grains, and tubers, never favoring one over the other, and never allowing any of them to suffer losses. At the same time, we must grasp all kinds of industrial raw material crops. For cotton, oilseeds, hemp, tobacco leaves, and sugar crops, we must grasp the most favorable time for harvesting, and as long as we can harvest a little more, we must ensure that we harvest a little more. We must also vigorously promote vegetables, fruits, and dried fruits. The importance of these things in national economic construction and the lives of urban and rural people is second only to grain and industrial raw materials; ensuring a large and good harvest can play a significant role in arranging people's lives and promoting industrial construction. In addition, there is the "small autumn harvest," which is the collection of wild plants. This is also an important source of starch, fiber, oil, wine, medicine, and so on. This year, it should be done on a larger scale than last year, and more should be obtained than last year.

In the autumn harvest, it is required to tightly grasp every field and not relax on any of them. We must take care of everything comprehensively, clarify responsibilities, and ensure that every piece of crop is harvested in a timely and meticulous manner. Special attention needs to be paid to "protecting the green" in remote areas and scattered plots near villages to avoid damage from wild animals, wild birds, livestock, poultry, and other damages.

In the autumn harvest, it is required to tightly grasp every link and not relax on any of them. Some communes have already proposed that this year's autumn harvest should achieve "five cleanness": clean cutting, clean transportation, clean threshing, clean winnowing, and clean sweeping. That is to say, not only should the ground be clean and the threshing floor be clear, but also nothing should be lost on the road and nothing should be left in the straw; not only should the main products (seeds, fibers, tubers, etc.) be harvested well, but also the by-products (straw, vines, pods, etc.) should be harvested well. From harvesting, transportation, threshing, drying, processing to storage and sales, every link must be done "cleanly and neatly." Agricultural activities do not end with the harvest, and its development trend is to extend to processing (at least preliminary processing). More and more attention should be paid to the processing link. For some crops, it is not enough to harvest them in a timely manner, and processing must also be timely. If processing is not timely for tubers, tobacco leaves, hemp stalks, and sugar crops, it will cause great losses. In this link, attention should also be paid to the overall planning and proper arrangement of feed, fertilizer, fuel, and raw materials. In short, not only should everything harvested in the autumn be kept without loss, but also all possible means should be used to make them play a greater role. At the same time, in the harvesting process of each crop, special attention should be paid to selecting and reserving enough good seeds, harvesting, threshing, drying, and storing them separately to ensure purity and germination rate, and to create conditions for striving for a bumper harvest in the autumn of next year.

Autumn planting must be extensive, of high quality, and timely. During the autumn planting season last year, a considerable part of the area was sown in drought conditions. In many areas, there was not a single thorough rain from winter wheat sowing to wheat harvest. Under such difficult circumstances, most areas still achieved a relatively good harvest after fighting drought and strengthening field management. Although the unit yield of winter wheat in some places was somewhat reduced due to the disaster, the total output was the same as or even higher than last year; the main reason was that more was planted during the autumn planting last year, and the quality of sowing was also better. This year's autumn sowing must strive to plant more, continue to implement the policy of both more planting and more harvesting, and high yield and more harvesting. Wherever conditions permit more planting, it should be planted as much as possible, and at the same time strive to improve the quality of sowing. "Good wheat depends on good sowing" is one of the experiences of wheat bumper harvests that our farmers have summed up based on long-term practice. Compared with other crops, the impact of good or bad sowing on the harvest is particularly large. This is determined by the growth and development law of wheat itself. The effective tillering of winter wheat mainly occurs before winter, and this is closely related to the sowing time and sowing quality. To strive for a summer harvest next year that is better than any in the past, we must first strive to plant more and better this autumn than in any previous year, and then further improve the level of field management on this basis. This is the first battle to seize victory on the agricultural front next year. A good fight in this battle will open up a broader and more solid road for next year's victory.

In the preparation for autumn planting, the first requirement is to ensure that the sowing area is implemented. The autumn sowing area must not only be implemented to each team, but also to each plot of land. Increasing the sowing area is the basic condition for increasing the total output. This point must be grasped early, tightly, and thoroughly. It is necessary to mobilize the masses, rely on the masses, and strive to expand the autumn sowing area by all possible means. We must comprehensively and properly arrange the stubble, and all of the main stubble, catch stubble, early stubble, and late stubble must be sown in a timely manner. In terms of expanding the autumn sowing area, special attention should be paid to the late stubble wheat in catch stubble wheat (generally cotton stubble, late corn stubble, potato stubble, vegetable stubble, rice stubble, etc.). In most areas, to expand the autumn sowing area, we must think of more ways on the late stubble wheat. We must vigorously promote the early maturity and early harvesting of the previous crop, so as to vacate the stubble early, prepare the land early, and sow as early as possible, striving for tillering before winter. In areas with habits and conditions, intercropping or interplanting can also be carried out between the rows of the previous crop; or seedlings can be raised first, and transplanted after the previous crop is harvested. The wasteland that has been reclaimed should be sown in autumn as much as possible. The implementation of the sowing area cannot remain on the numerical figure of the area, it must be implemented to the plots. It is necessary to refer to the situation of the previous crop, and at the same time take into account the plan for spring sowing next year, be farsighted, and make clever arrangements. Plant as much as possible for every acre that can be planted, and as much as possible for every cent that can be planted, and do not give up any opportunity that may be planted more.

In the preparation for autumn planting, the target of yield increase is also required to be implemented. The yield target must also be implemented to each team and each plot of land. Based on the quality of the soil, the quality of water conservancy conditions, the abundance of this year's summer harvest, and the abundance of summer harvests in previous years, as well as the newly added favorable conditions, yield targets and contracted output targets should be set separately. The contracted output target should be appropriately lower than the yield target, and the yield target should be appropriately higher than the actual output in normal years in recent years. When formulating yield targets, it is necessary to mobilize commune members to seriously discuss, it is necessary to make every commune member understand the importance of vigorously developing agriculture and grain production, it is necessary to earnestly implement the Party's policy, adhere to the principle of unified leadership and team-based, adhere to the "three guarantees and one reward" system, and on the basis of earnest implementation, the enthusiasm of the broad masses of commune members should be further developed.

In the preparation for autumn planting, it is also required that the measures for increasing production be implemented. Only when the measures for increasing production are implemented can the sowing area and yield target be truly implemented. For the implementation of measures for increasing production, the most important things at present are the implementation of seeds, the implementation of base fertilizer, the implementation of plowing and sowing tools, the implementation of water conservancy work, and the implementation of labor and animal power; at the same time, it is also necessary to ensure the implementation of sowing time. These measures should be adapted to the requirements of expanding the area and increasing the yield, and special attention should be paid to adapting to the situation of the increase in late stubble. The seeds should be sufficient, carefully selected, and germination tests and seed treatment (disinfection and strengthening) should be done well; and we should strive to appropriately match various varieties with different maturity periods, different adaptability, and different resistance, based on sowing time, soil, terrain, previous and subsequent stubble, climate conditions, pest and disease forecasts, and rational use of labor. Base fertilizer should not only be sufficient, but also be delivered to the fields before the autumn harvest. We should strive to apply fertilizer according to the land, and implement all possible fertilizers for base fertilizer to each piece of land according to the different requirements of various types of land. Plowing and sowing tools should adapt to the needs of expanding the area, and also adapt to the needs of improving the quality of sowing; especially important is to equip and train enough machine operators as soon as possible, and to match people and machines well. In relatively arid areas, autumn irrigation and moisture preservation should be implemented as soon as possible; in areas with excessive rainfall, drainage and land preparation should be implemented as soon as possible. These should be the responsibility of specific personnel and completed within a time limit. The sowing time for each piece of land should be arranged to ensure timely sowing for each piece. This should be closely linked to the arrangement of the autumn harvest and done together. The implementation of measures for increasing production should be carried out simultaneously with the implementation of the sowing area and the yield target, discussing and acting at the same time. The implementation of measures is the basic guarantee for the implementation of the area and the implementation of the target.

Autumn harvest should be large and good, autumn planting should be extensive and good, and there is a common requirement, that is, timeliness. Without timeliness, it is impossible to have more and good. "Time is output, time is grain," this is true for both autumn harvest and autumn planting. The autumn harvest should be done well, managed well, and used well, and the autumn planting should be done while harvesting, plowing, and sowing, all of which require seizing time. Everything that can be done in advance should be done as early as possible, so that the farm work during the autumn harvest period can not be over-concentrated, and the autumn planting can be done in a more timely and meticulous manner. If the opportunity is lost, the autumn harvest may suffer a great loss; if the autumn harvest is delayed, it will affect the autumn planting. Seizing time includes two aspects: one is early, and the other is fast. Being both early and fast makes us proactive.

How can we be both early and fast? This depends on the quantity and quality of labor, animal power, power, and tools, depends on the rational organization and rational use of human and material resources, depends on in-depth, specific, meticulous, and accurate leadership, and depends on the concerted support of all walks of life.

The autumn harvest and autumn planting are basically carried out at the same time. On the one hand, we must ensure a relatively good autumn harvest this year, and on the other hand, we must strive for a summer harvest next year that is better than any in the past. The task is very heavy. To ensure a comprehensive victory, the whole Party and the whole people must take action, and concentrate a strong labor army and leadership to participate in the autumn harvest and autumn planting. Commanders at all levels must go to the front line to lead, count, and use troops. It is necessary to effectively check and arrange the labor force used in the fields. According to the existing experience of some areas, it is best to divide the autumn harvest and autumn planting into two teams, each basically having its own responsibilities; organize the battle line, divide the stages according to the autumn harvest, autumn plowing, and autumn planting process, and launch an assault. In different stages of the autumn harvest and autumn planting, the strength needed by the two sides is different, and it can also be flexibly mobilized within a certain period and within a certain range. In this way, the division of labor and collaboration can be better combined, and the role of each person can be brought into full play. Political work and economic work should be closely combined. In the autumn harvest, it is necessary to ensure the implementation of the "three guarantees and one reward" system, which promotes the autumn harvest on the one hand, and helps to promote the "three guarantees and one reward" in the autumn planting, which also promotes the autumn planting on the other hand.

The forces from all walks of life that support the autumn harvest and autumn planting should be accurate in seeing the opportunity and the key, and be good at using them. Special attention should be paid to supporting areas with less labor and animal power, disaster-stricken areas, and all relatively difficult production areas. More strength should also be invested in key production areas of commercial grain and industrial raw materials.

The enthusiasm of the whole Party and the whole people to vigorously develop agriculture and grain production has been further developed. The autumn harvest and autumn planting are great opportunities for heroes from all walks of life to show their talents. The current specific goals are: strive for more harvest and good harvest, strive for more planting and good planting. Let us unite as one and move towards these two major goals!

### 收好秋，种好麦

    收好秋，种好麦
    大办农业，大办粮食，是长期的任务，也是迫切的任务，有远大的目标，也有当前的目标。远大的目标是彻底实现农业的现代化，使农产品极大地丰富起来；当前的目标是保证今年获得一个较好的秋收，争取明年获得一个比过去任何一年都好的夏收。“千里之行，始于足下”。要达到远大的目标，必须切实地做好当前的工作。一个秋收，一个秋种，这两件事情决定着今明两年农业生产战线和粮食生产战线的大局，必须集中一切能够集中的力量，大办特办，办快办好。
    怎样才是大办特办？就是全党动员，全民动员，多收多种，多多益善。
    怎样才是办快办好？就是抓紧时间，贯彻始终，抓住关键，精益求精。
    秋收必须多收、收好、收得适时。今年在自然灾害严重而且频繁的情况下，春播、夏播都取得了很大的胜利，田间管理也取得了很大的胜利。在对大自然作斗争中，全国各地农村人民公社社员、各级干部和从各方面支援农业的人员，都下了很大力气，付出了大量的劳动，多种再多种，细管再细管；这一切努力的目的，都在于多收一些秋粮，多收一些工业原料。现在，在广大地区，早秋作物正在收获，中秋作物、晚秋作物的收获也将陆续开始。要保证今年获得一个较好的秋收，除了继续加强晚秋作物田间管理以外，最重要的就是把秋收工作做好。这是夺取今年农业战线的胜利的最后关头。几个月的工作做得很好，收获时节几天甚至几小时的工作如果疏忽大意，仍然有大受损失的可能。既然在种和管的时候比往年下了更大的工夫，在收的时候也应该力求比往年更及时、更俐落、更细致。
    在秋收中，要求对每一种作物都紧紧抓住，一样也不放松。首要的是抓各种粮食作物，对主粮、杂粮、薯类全要十分重视，决不可厚此薄彼，决不可让任何一样遭受损失。同时要抓各种工业原料作物，对棉花、油料、麻类、烟叶、糖料，都要掌握住收获的最有利的时机，只要能够多收一点，就要保证多收一点。还要大抓蔬菜、水果、干果，这些东西在国家经济建设和城乡人民生活中的重要性，仅次于粮食和工业原料；保证多收收好，对安排人民生活和促进工业建设能起很大的作用。此外还有“小秋收”，就是采集野生植物，这也是淀粉、纤维、油、酒、药等等的一个重要的来源；今年要办的规模比去年更大、拿到手的比去年更多。
    在秋收中，要求对每一块田地都紧紧抓住，一块也不放松。要全面顾到，分清责任，保证每一块庄稼都及时地细致地收回来。远地和村庄附近的零星地，特别需要注意“护青”，以免遭受野兽、野禽、家畜、家禽的损害和其他的损害。
    在秋收中，要求对每一个环节都紧紧抓住，一环也不放松。有些公社已经提出来今年秋收要做到“五净”：割得净，运得净，打得净，扬得净，扫得净。也就是说，不只要做到地净场光，还要做到路上不丢、秸里不留；不只要把正产品（籽粒、纤维、薯块等等）收好，还要把副产品（秸秆、藤蔓、荚角等等）收好。从收割、运输、脱粒、翻晒、加工直到入仓、交售，每个环节都要做得“干净俐落”。农业活动并不是到收获为止，它的发展趋势是要延长到加工（至少是初步加工）。对于加工这个环节要越来越加注意。有些作物，光是收得及时还不行，加工也必须及时，如薯块、烟叶、麻秆、糖料，加工不及时都会造成很大的损失。在这个环节上，对于饲料、肥料、燃料、原料也要注意统筹兼顾、妥善安排。总之，不光要使秋季收获的一切东西一点不丢，还要千方百计地使它们发挥更大的效用。同时，在每一种作物的收获过程中，还要特别注意选留足够的良种，单收单打单晒单藏，保证纯度，保证发芽率，为争取明年秋季丰收创造条件。
    秋种必须多种、种好、种得适时。去年秋种时期，相当大部分地区都是抗旱播种的；有不少地区，从冬小麦播种直到麦收，没有下一次透雨。在这样艰难的情况下，大部分地区经过抗旱斗争和加强田间管理，仍然夺得了较好的收成。有些地方冬小麦单位产量虽然因灾有所降低，但是总产量却跟去年相平甚至有所提高；主要原因就是去年秋种的时候种得比较多，播种的质量也比较好。今年秋播必须力争多种，继续贯彻执行多种多收和高产多收同时并举的方针，凡是有条件多种的应该尽量多种，同时力求提高播种质量。“麦好在种”，这是我国农民根据长期的实践总结出来的小麦丰产经验之一。麦子同别的作物相比，种得好坏对收成的影响特别大，这是麦子本身的生长发育规律决定的。冬小麦的有效分蘖主要是在过冬前形成的，而这又同播种时间、播种质量有极密切的关系。要争取明年获得一个比过去任何一年都好的夏收，首先要力求今年秋季比过去任何一年种得更多更好，然后在这基础上进一步提高田间管理的水平。这是夺取明年农业战线的胜利的第一道关。这一仗打得好，就能给明年的胜利开辟一条更广阔更坚实的道路。
    在秋种准备中，首先要求播种面积落实。秋播面积，不只要落实到每一个队，而且要落实到每一块地。增加播种面积是增加总产量的基本条件，对这一点必须及早抓住，紧紧抓住，一抓到底。要发动群众，依靠群众，千方百计为扩大秋播面积而斗争。要全面地妥善地安排茬口，不论正茬、赶茬，早茬、晚茬，都要全部适时种好。就扩大秋播面积来说，特别要注意赶茬麦中的晚茬麦（一般是棉花茬、晚玉米茬、薯茬、菜茬、稻茬等）。大部分地区，要扩大秋播面积，都要在晚茬麦上多想办法。要力促前茬作物早熟、早收，以便早腾茬、早整地，尽可能早播种，力争冬前分蘖。在有习惯有条件的地区，还可以在前茬行间间作套种；或者先行育苗，前茬收了再移栽。已经开垦出来的荒地，要力争全部在秋季播种。播种面积落实，不能停留在面积的数目字上，一定要落实到地块。要参照前茬作物的情况，同时顾及明年春播的计划，高瞻远瞩，精巧安排。能多种一亩就多种一亩，能多种一分就多种一分，任何可能多种的机会都不要放弃。
    在秋种准备中，又要求产量指标落实。产量指标也要落实到每一个队，每一块地。要根据每一块地土质好坏、水利条件好坏、今年夏收丰歉情况和往年夏收丰歉情况，以及新增加的有利条件，分别订出产量指标和包产指标。包产指标应当适当地低于产量指标，产量指标应当适当地高于最近几年正常年景的实产量。制定产量指标的时候，必须发动社员群众认真讨论，必须使每个社员了解大办农业、大办粮食的重要性，必须切实贯彻执行党的政策，坚持统一领导、队为基础的原则，坚持“三包一奖”的制度，在认真落实的基础上，把广大社员群众的积极性更高地发扬起来。
    在秋收准备中，还要求增产措施落实。只有增产措施落实了，播种面积和产量指标才能真正落实。增产措施落实，当前最重要的是种子落实，底肥落实，耕播工具落实，水利工作落实，劳力和畜力落实；同时，还要确保播种时间落实。这些措施，都要同面积扩大和产量提高的要求相适应，特别要注意同晚茬增加的情况相适应。种子要备足，要精选，要作好发芽试验和种子处理（消毒和强化）；并且要力求根据播种时间、土壤、地势、前茬后茬、气候条件、病虫预测和劳动力合理运用等等情况，适当搭配成熟期不同、适应性不同、抗逆力不同的各种品种。底肥不但要力求备足，并且要在秋收前就送到地头，要力求因地施肥，把一切可能用作底肥的肥料都按照各类土地不同的要求落实到每一块地。耕播工具要适应扩大面积的需要，也要适应提高播种质量的需要；特别重要的是及早配备和训练足够的机具操作手，把人和机具很好地搭配起来。比较干旱的地区，要及早实行秋灌、保墒；雨水过多的地区，要及早排涝、整地。这些都要有专人负责，限期完成。每一块地的播种时间，都要排列出来，确保块块适时播种。这要和秋收的安排紧紧衔接，一并做好。增产措施的落实，应该和播种面积的落实、产量指标的落实同时进行，一边讨论，一边行动。措施落实是面积落实、指标落实的基本保证。
    秋收要多收、收好，秋种要多种、种好，有一个共同的要求，就是及时。不及时，就都不可能多，也都不可能好。“时间就是产量，时间就是粮食”，对秋收和秋种说，都是如此。秋收要作到收好、管好、用好，秋种要做到边收、边耕、边种，都需要抢时间。凡是能提前做的事情都尽可能提前做，秋收期间农活就可以不过分集中，秋种也能够做得比较适时细致。如果失去了时机，秋收就可能受到很大损失；秋收拖迟了，又会影响到秋种。抢时间，包括两个方面：一个是早，一个是快。又早又快，就主动了。
    怎样才能做到又早又快呢？这决定于劳动力、畜力、动力和工具的数量和质量，决定于人力、物力的合理组织和合理使用，决定于深入、具体、细致、准确的领导，决定于各行各业同心协力的支援。
    秋收、秋种基本上是同时进行，一方面要保证今年获得一个较好的秋收，一方面要争取明年获得一个比以往任何一年都好的夏收，任务是十分重大的。要确保全面胜利，必须全党动手，全民动手，集中强大的劳动大军和领导力量参加秋收、秋种。各级指挥员要到最前线去带兵、点兵、用兵。要切实把用在田间的劳动力点查清楚、安排得当。据一些地区已有的经验，秋收和秋种最好大体上分成两套人马，基本上各有专责；组织战线，根据秋收秋耕秋种进程划分阶段，展开突击。在秋收、秋种的不同阶段，两方面需要的力量有所不同，又可以在一定时期、一定范围内灵活调动。这样就可以把分工和协作更好地结合起来，最充分地发挥每个人的作用。政治工作和经济工作要密切结合起来。秋收中要保证贯彻执行“三包一奖”的制度，这一方面对秋收有促进作用，一方面又有助于在秋种中推行“三包一奖”，对秋种也有促进作用。
    各行各业支援秋收秋种的力量，要看准时机、看准关键，善于运用。对于劳动力、畜力较少的地区，受灾的地区，一切比较困难的产区，要特别注意支援。对于商品粮食和工业原料的重点产区，也要投入较多的力量。
    全党全民大办农业、大办粮食的积极性已经更进一步发扬起来了。秋收、秋种，正是各路英雄大显身手的大好时机。当前的具体目标就是：力争多收、收好，力争多种、种好。让我们万众一心，向着这两大目标前进！
