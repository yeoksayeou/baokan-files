Several Types of Hot Air Furnaces

    Vertical Hot Air Furnace
    This furnace can generate 60,000 calories of heat and can supply heating for an area of 500 square meters. It saves 20% more coal than a coal stove. The furnace heats air both inside and out. A large iron bucket sits atop the fire chamber (built with refractory bricks) to serve as the hot air chamber. Surrounding the hot air chamber is the flue, and outside the flue is another hot air chamber. The outer shell of the furnace is made of red bricks, with two cold air inlets. One leads directly to the interlayer between the outer shell and the combustion chamber, and the other passes through this interlayer and the combustion chamber, sending cold air into the middle interlayer of the furnace body. This allows both the inner and outer ventilation ducts of the combustion chamber to be heated simultaneously. Then, the hot air is sent into the room through the hot air duct. (Image attached)

    Horizontal Hot Air Furnace
    This furnace can supply heating for an area of 150 square meters. It saves 58% more coal than a coal stove, and the indoor temperature remains above 16 degrees Celsius.
    The structure of the furnace is as follows: the total area of the combustion chamber is 50 cm x 60 cm, and the height of the furnace chamber is 50 cm. The furnace chamber is divided into upper and lower parts. The upper part is installed with twelve steel pipes with a diameter of 7.5 cm, and the lower part is installed with nine cast iron pipes with a diameter of 10 cm, serving as hot air chambers. A partition wall is set up between the upper and lower parts, so that the cold air first flows in from the lower part and then is discharged from the upper part. There are a total of three hot air outlets, with outlet diameters of 25 to 30 cm. There are two cold air inlets at the bottom. (Image attached)

    Hot Air Furnace for Residential Use
    This type of hot air furnace utilizes the original stove without modification, only adding a space layer around the furnace core as a hot air chamber. According to the number of people and the size of the stove cover, an iron furnace core with a height of 19 cm, a diameter of 25 to 29 cm, and a flue of 12 cm is made. Using this furnace, the indoor temperature can be maintained at around 15 degrees Celsius, saving about 30% more coal than a coal stove. (Image attached)

    Neighborhood Mutual Aid Hot Air Furnace
    Its construction is the same as the residential hot air furnace. The difference is the addition of a hot air pipe, allowing couples who work double shifts or families who do not cook at home to borrow heat from their neighbors. The benefits are: reducing housework for couples who work double shifts after getting off work, and saving about 40% more coal.

    几种热风炉
      立式热风炉
    这座炉能产生六万卡热量，能供应五百平方米的采暖面积，比煤炉省煤百分之二十。炉子是里外加热气，火膛（用耐火砖砌的）上坐一个大铁桶做为热风室，围绕热风室是烟道，烟道外面也是热风室。炉的外壳用红砖砌成，留出两个冷风口，一个直接通向外壳与燃烧室夹层，另一个经过这个夹层和燃烧室，将冷风送入炉体中间的夹层，使燃烧室内外两条通风道同时受热，然后通过热风道，将热风送入室内。（附图片）

      卧式热风炉
    这座炉能供应一百五十平方米的采暖面积，比煤炉省煤百分之五十八，室内温度始终保持十六度以上。
    炉子的构造是燃烧室总面积为五十厘米×六十厘米，炉膛高度为五十厘米，炉膛内分上下两部，上部安装七点五厘米口径钢管十二根，下部安装十厘米口径铸铁管九根，作为热风室。上下两部设有隔墙，使冷风先由下部流入，再由上部排出，热风出口共设三处，出口直径为二十五到三十厘米，下部设有冷风口两处。（附图片）
    卧式热风炉示意图
      居民使用的热风炉
    这种热风炉利用原有锅灶不变，只围绕炉芯修一个空间层，作为热风室。根据人口多少，炉盖大小而制成高十九厘米，粗二十五到二十九厘米，烟道十二厘米的铁制炉芯。使用这种炉子，室内温度可以保持十五度左右，比煤炉省煤百分之三十左右。（附图片）
    民用热风炉示意图
      邻里互助热风炉
    其构造与居民热风炉同。不同的地方多出了一个热风管，使夫妻双上班职工或不在家做饭的家庭，借邻居的火取暖。好处是：减少夫妻双上班职工下班后的家务劳动，节约煤百分之四十左右。
