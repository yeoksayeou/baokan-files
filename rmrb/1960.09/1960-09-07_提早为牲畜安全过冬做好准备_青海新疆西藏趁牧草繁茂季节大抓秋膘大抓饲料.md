    To prepare early for the safe wintering of livestock, Qinghai, Xinjiang, and Tibet are seizing the season of lush pastures to intensify autumn fattening and fodder storage.

    (From our correspondent in Xining, 6th) Commune members in the pastoral areas of Qinghai Province, while vigorously promoting livestock fattening and mating, striving to achieve full fatness and pregnancy in all types of livestock as quickly as possible, are also actively arranging winter and spring pastures, repairing and supplementing sheds and pens, and storing large quantities of green and dry grass, making thorough preparations for livestock to survive the winter early.

    Livestock in Qinghai's grasslands have always relied on natural grazing. Since the Great Leap Forward in 1958, relying on the enormous advantages of the people's communes – large populations and the ability to arrange and utilize grasslands in a unified and rational way – has created more favorable conditions for further preparing for livestock to survive the winter. In particular, in 1959, ethnic herders stored more than 1.3 billion catties of green and dry grass and newly built and renovated more than 80,000 sheds and pens, storing an average of more than 200 catties of grass per head for pregnant, weak, young, and breeding livestock. Many areas achieved pens for large livestock and sheds for young livestock, resulting in the highest livestock breeding survival rate since liberation this year.

    This year, the work of preparing for livestock to survive the winter in various places started earlier and has been more tightly grasped than in any previous year. Many areas have also built maternity rooms for pregnant livestock and warm sheds for young livestock on winter and spring pastures. In order to reserve sufficient winter and spring pastures and ensure that there are enough pastures for grazing during the long winter and spring dry season, many commune production teams have conscientiously implemented the system of rotational grazing by zones, trying every possible means to improve the utilization rate of summer and autumn pastures.

    Currently, it is the peak growing season on the grasslands when pastures are lush, flowering, and seeding. Communes are taking production teams as units and adopting a combination of organizing specialized teams and launching mass movements to universally carry out rush harvesting and silage making to prepare the fodder needed for winter and spring supplementary feeding for all types of livestock. While organizing manpower to rush harvest pastures in areas with tall and dense grass, many production teams have also universally launched a movement among herdsmen to "go out with a sickle early and bundle a bundle of grass late," both grazing the livestock well and cutting and storing green grass.

    (From our correspondent in Urumqi, 6th) In the current golden season of lush pastures, people's communes, state-owned farms, and joint state-private farms in the vast agricultural and pastoral areas of Xinjiang are focusing on the three main links of the livestock production increase movement: vigorously promoting full fattening, mating, and pregnancy; vigorously protecting livestock and fetuses; and vigorously cutting and storing grass. They strive to complete and overfulfill this year's livestock breeding plan and prepare conditions for greater development of livestock production in the autonomous region next year.

    In order to improve livestock fatness and mating estrus rates, farmers and herdsmen of all ethnic groups in the autonomous region have been focusing on grazing work since the beginning of summer. Hundreds of thousands of herders participating in livestock professional teams have moved into summer pastures with millions of livestock. The party secretaries in charge of animal husbandry also went to the pastoral areas to work on a rotating basis, going deep into the front line. They adopted the method of group grazing and grading according to the pasture group, diligent shouting, and slow driving to extend grazing time, which greatly improved livestock fatness.

    Full fatness lays the foundation for full mating and pregnancy. While vigorously promoting summer fattening, various places in the autonomous region have also begun the breeding work of millions of large livestock and promoted intensive breeding of nearly two million small livestock. Various places have adopted various methods such as hot mating, re-mating, and cross-mating to improve the mating rate of large livestock. By the beginning of August, the intensive mating plan for small livestock had been overfulfilled, and the mating of large livestock had exceeded half.

    Since mid-July, the grass on various pastures has been more than a foot high. Under the slogan of storing 1,000 catties of grass for each head of large livestock and 300 catties of grass for small livestock, a mass movement of early grass cutting, more grass cutting, and good grass cutting has been widely launched in the agricultural and pastoral areas of the entire autonomous region. Generally, pastoral areas have drawn more than 30% of the labor force during the gap before and after the busy summer harvest, and agricultural areas have also drawn nearly 10% of the labor force to cut and store grass.

    (Xinhua News Agency) At present, it is the season of lush grass and abundant water in the pastoral areas on the Tibetan Plateau. The emancipated herders in various places are taking advantage of the favorable opportunity to vigorously promote autumn fattening of livestock and actively prepare for livestock to survive the winter and spring well.

    After the anti-rebellion, anti-Ula corvée system, and anti-personal dependence and the mutual benefit movement between herdsmen and owners in the Tibetan pastoral areas, the herders' enthusiasm for production has been unprecedentedly high. They have successively organized mutual aid groups for animal husbandry production, changing the past situation where they could only graze on fixed small pastures. According to the climate and the quality of the pastures, they have unified the planning of the pastures so that livestock can eat good grass in all seasons. Since July, the herders have been driving cattle and sheep to graze in the mountains. When the weather turns cold, they will drive the cattle and sheep to the river valley plains to spend the harsh winter and spring seasons there.

    In order to focus on the autumn fattening of livestock, many districts and townships in Heihe, Dangxiong, Mozhugongka, and Lajiari counties have held meetings of herders, summarized the local original grazing experience, and promoted advanced grazing methods, universally implementing separate grazing of old, weak, male, and female livestock.

    While vigorously promoting autumn fattening, the herders in various places have also drawn a part of the labor force to renovate the pens and sheds for livestock to spend the winter, changing the past habit of not cutting winter grass.

    提早为牲畜安全过冬做好准备
    青海新疆西藏趁牧草繁茂季节大抓秋膘大抓饲料
    本报西宁6日电　青海省牧业区各公社社员，在大抓畜膘，大搞配种，力争各类牲畜尽快实现满膘、满怀的同时，积极安排冬春草场、修棚补圈，大量打贮青草、干草，及早为牲畜越冬作好充分准备。
    青海草原上的各类牲畜，一向依靠自然放牧。1958年大跃进以来，由于依靠了人民公社人多势众、草原可以统一安排、合理规划利用的巨大优越性，为进一步作好牲畜越冬准备创造了更加有利的条件。特别是1959年，各族牧民共打贮青干草一十三亿多斤，新修和整修棚圈八万多个，给孕、弱、幼、种四类牲畜平均每头贮草二百多斤，许多地区实现了大畜有圈，幼畜有棚，从而使今年牲畜的繁殖成活率出现了解放以来的最高纪录。
    今年，各地为牲畜作好越冬准备的工作，比任何一年动手早，抓得紧。许多地区还在冬春草场上修筑了孕畜产房和幼畜暖棚。为了留足冬春草场，保证在漫长的冬春枯草季节能有足够的草场可供放牧，许多公社生产队都认真执行划片轮牧的制度，千方百计提高夏秋草场的利用率。
    目前，正是草原上牧草繁茂、开花结籽的生长旺期。各公社都以生产队为单位，采取组织专业队与大搞群众运动相结合的办法，普遍进行突击打草青贮，为各类牲畜准备冬春补饲所需的草料。许多生产队在组织人力，选择草高茂密的地方进行突击抢收牧草的同时，还普遍发动放牧员开展“早出一把镰，晚捆一捆草”的运动，既放好了牲畜，又割贮了青草。
    本报乌鲁木齐6日电　新疆广大农牧业地区各人民公社、国营农牧场和公私合营牧场在当前牧草繁茂的黄金季节里，大抓满膘满配、满怀、大抓保畜保胎、大抓打草储草等畜牧业增产运动的三个主要环节，力争完成和超额完成今年牲畜增殖计划，并为明年自治区畜牧业生产更大的发展准备条件。
    为了提高牲畜膘度和配种发情率，入夏以来自治区各族农牧民狠抓牧放工作。成千上万的参加畜牧业专业队的牧民，随着千百万牲畜转入夏季牧场。各主管畜牧业的党委书记也到牧区流动办公，深入第一线。他们采用根据牧草群落实行分群分级牧放、勤吆慢赶的办法，延长放牧时间，使牲畜膘度大大提高。
    满膘为满配满怀打下基础，自治区各地在大抓夏膘的同时，就着手进行几百万头大畜的配种工作和推行近二百万只小畜密集繁殖。各地采取热配、复配、杂交配种等多种办法提高大畜配种率。到8月初，小畜密集配种计划超额完成，大畜配种已超过半数。
    7月中旬以来，各牧场草高盈尺。在为每头大畜储草一千斤、小畜储草三百斤口号下一个早打草、多打草和打好草的群众性打草储草运动在全自治区农牧地区广泛开展起来。一般牧业地区在夏收大忙前后的空隙，抽出了30％以上的劳动力，农业地区也抽出将近10％的劳动力打草储草。
    据新华社讯　目前正是西藏高原上牧区水草丰茂的季节，各地翻身牧民利用大好时机，大抓牲畜秋膘，为牲畜过好冬春积极作准备。
    西藏牧区经过反对叛乱、反对乌拉差役制度、反对人身依附和牧工、牧主两利运动以后，牧民的生产热情空前高涨，纷纷组织了牧业生产互助组，改变了过去只能在固定的小块牧场上放牧的情况，根据气候、草场的好坏，统一规划了牧场，使牲畜四季都能吃上好草。从7月开始，牧民们纷纷赶着牛羊到山地放牧，待天气转冷时，再把牛羊赶到河谷平原，让牲畜在那里度过冬春严寒季节。
    为了抓好牲畜秋膘，黑河、当雄、墨竹工卡和拉加里等县的许多区、乡都召开了牧民会议，总结了当地原有的放牧经验，并推行了先进的放牧方法，普遍按牲畜的老、弱、公、母实行了分群放牧。
    各地牧民在大抓秋膘中，还抽出一部分劳动力整修牲畜过冬的圈棚，改变过去不打冬草的习惯。
