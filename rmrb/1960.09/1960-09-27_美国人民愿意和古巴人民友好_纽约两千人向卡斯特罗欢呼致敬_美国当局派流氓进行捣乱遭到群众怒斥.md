　　Two Thousand People in New York Cheer and Salute Castro
    U.S. Authorities Dispatch Thugs to Make Trouble, Met with Mass Condemnation
    Xinhua News Agency, New York, September 25th: A New York dispatch states that on the evening of the 24th, over two thousand New York citizens gathered in front of the Cuban delegation's residence in the Harlem black district of New York, cheering and saluting Cuban Prime Minister Castro, who was attending the United Nations General Assembly.

    Castro leaned out of the window of his nine-story residence and waved to the crowd, then walked onto the balcony, at which point the crowd repeatedly cheered enthusiastically.

    As the crowd cheered and saluted Castro, large numbers of American police and mounted police, wielding batons, fiercely monitored the cheering masses. The U.S. authorities also arranged for a group of thugs, riding in cars and carrying American flags, to arrive in front of Castro's residence to make trouble. They were met with angry condemnation from the masses.

    新华社25日讯　纽约消息：24日晚上两千多名纽约市民聚集在纽约哈莱姆黑人区古巴出席联合国大会代表团住所前面，向古巴总理卡斯特罗欢呼致敬。
    卡斯特罗从他所住的九层楼的窗子里探出身来向群众招手，接着又走到阳台上，这时群众一再热烈欢呼。
    在群众向卡斯特罗欢呼致敬时，大批手执警棍的美国警察和骑警凶狠地监视着欢呼的群众。美国当局并且搞了一批流氓乘着汽车、手执美国旗赶到卡斯特罗的住所前进行捣乱。他们遭到群众的怒斥。
