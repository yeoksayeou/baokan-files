Xinhua News Agency report: The Central Meteorological Bureau recently issued an urgent notice on preventing early frost from harming autumn-ripening crops. The notice requires meteorological departments in all regions to pay close attention to weather changes, prepare for frost prevention and other forecasts, and, under the leadership of Party committees at all levels, disseminate frost prevention knowledge and assist rural people's communes in preparing for frost prevention. When early frost occurs, they should guide people's communes in frost prevention.

The notice stated that severe early frost often causes irreparable and incalculable losses to autumn-ripening crops. This year, various regions have launched campaigns to increase production and practice economy, and have increased the planting of late autumn and very late autumn crops. These crops are harvested later, and frost prevention is a key measure to ensure the harvest and good yield of these crops. This year, the general autumn-ripening crops were also planted later due to early drought, which also increases the importance of current frost prevention.

According to historical surveys, Northeast China and Inner Mongolia enter the frost season in mid-to-late September. The first frost in the North China Plain and Guanzhong Plain generally occurs in mid-to-late October, earlier in mountainous areas. The middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River generally experience the first frost in late November or early December. According to current meteorological forecasts, some regions may experience early frost with extremely harmful effects this year, which requires close vigilance. In addition, typhoons, droughts, floods, hail, and other disasters may continue to occur in some areas, and it is necessary to strengthen forecasting and prevention work.

The notice stated that to do a good job in autumn meteorological services, meteorological service departments in all regions must closely rely on the leadership of Party committees at all levels and widely mobilize the enthusiasm of all meteorological personnel. In terms of work, they must first make a forecast of frost and low-temperature activities this autumn based on the laws of frost occurrence and low-temperature activities in previous years. They must immediately cooperate with agricultural departments to focus on major crops such as grain, cotton, and sweet potatoes, and major areas, identify key points for frost prevention, and prepare materials, equipment, and manpower for frost prevention. Secondly, they must provide weather forecasts for sunny and rainy days during the harvest and sowing seasons, as well as agricultural meteorological reports on soil moisture during wheat sowing, so that production departments can properly arrange production and organize labor.

The notice finally requested meteorological departments in all regions to do a good job in meteorological services for iron and steel production, transportation, and other aspects while doing a good job in agricultural meteorological services.

In order to do a good job in autumn meteorological services, relevant leaders of the Central Meteorological Bureau have recently gone deep into Northeast China and other places to carry out specific deployments and inspection work.

### 中央气象局发出紧急通知  注意天气变化作好防霜准备

    中央气象局发出紧急通知
    注意天气变化作好防霜准备
    据新华社讯　中央气象局最近发出了预防早霜危害秋熟作物的紧急通知，要求各地气象部门密切注意天气变化，作好防霜等预报工作，并在各级党委领导下传布防霜知识和协助农村人民公社作好防霜的准备工作，在发生早霜时指导人民公社防霜。
    通知说，严重的早期霜冻，对秋熟作物往往造成不可挽救和无法估计的损失。今年各地开展增产节约运动，增种晚秋和晚晚秋作物很多，这些作物收获较迟，防霜是保证这些作物收获、收好的关键措施。今年一般秋熟作物也因早期干旱播种较迟，这也增加了当前防霜的重要性。
    据历年考察，我国东北和内蒙古地区9月中、下旬就进入了霜期，华北平原和关中平原的初霜冻一般在10月中、下旬出现，山区早些。长江中下游一般在11月下旬或12月初出现初霜冻。据目前的气象预测，部分地区今年有提早出现危害性极大的早期霜冻的可能，不能不严加警惕。此外，台风、旱、涝、冰雹等灾害在某些地区仍有继续发生的可能，必须加强预报和预防的工作。
    通知说，要做好秋季气象服务工作，各地气象服务部门必须紧密依靠各级党委的领导，广泛动员全体气象人员的积极性。在工作上要首先根据历年霜冻发生和低温活动的规律做出今秋霜冻和低温活动的展望，并立即配合农业部门抓粮、棉、甘薯等主要作物、主要地区，找出防霜冻的重点，做好预防霜冻的物资器材和人力等的准备。其次要做好收获时期和播种时期的晴雨天气预报以及小麦播种时的土壤墒情等农业气象报告，以便生产部门妥善安排生产、组织劳力。
    通知最后还要求各地气象部门，在做好农业气象服务的同时，还要做好钢铁生产、交通运输等方面的气象服务工作。
    为了做好秋季气象服务工作，最近中央气象局有关领导人员已深入到东北等地进行具体的部署和检查工作。
