　　Xinhua News Agency, Budapest, 26th. In Hungary, the mass movement to support agriculture, formed with the rapid progress of agricultural cooperation in the past two years, is now developing more and more widely.

　　Various industrial sectors have launched labor competitions to support agricultural production. Workers are striving to tap potential and provide more agricultural machinery, chemical fertilizers, and building materials to rural areas. Last year, the national production of agricultural machinery increased by 35%, and the production plan for agricultural machinery in the first half of this year was also overfulfilled.

　　The Budapest Red Star Tractor Factory shortened the production time for each tractor by 50 hours and produced some new and highly efficient agricultural machines. The workers of the Mosonmagyaróvár Agricultural Machinery Factory decided to double production this year and trial-produce ten new types of seeders. The Borsod Chemical United Factory overproduced more than 3,000 tons of nitrogen fertilizer in the first half of the year.

　　Currently, almost all factories, enterprises, state-owned farms, and organizations have established regular contact with agricultural cooperatives, each undertaking the task of assisting a new cooperative. Larger factories and enterprises also assist several cooperatives simultaneously. Factories and enterprises in Budapest alone are responsible for assisting nearly a thousand agricultural production cooperatives. In this way, all new cooperatives across the country have received regular help.

　　Party organizations in factories and government bodies often go to the countryside to conduct political propaganda work, helping to establish and develop Party organizations. Members of Party organizations in factories and government bodies also frequently participate in meetings of cooperative Party organizations to introduce Party work experience and methods, helping rural Party organizations to raise the socialist consciousness of farmers, overcome the various contradictions that often arise between small-peasant ideology and collective ownership, and establish a collectivist viewpoint. Currently, Party grassroots organizations have been established in all cooperatives in Győr-Sopron, Szolnok, and Veszprém counties. Administrative and technical cadres from factories and government bodies frequently go to the countryside to help cooperatives formulate production and financial plans, improve labor organization, design various architectural drawings, and purchase building materials.

　　Workers from machine factories in Budapest and Szolnok counties and technical worker teams from the Salgótarján mining area regularly go to the countryside to repair machines and farm implements for cooperatives, while actively training members to master various technologies. Many factory workers also use holidays and rest time to build livestock sheds and install electric lights for cooperatives.

　　After the establishment of a large number of new cooperatives, many political workers and technicians responded to the Party's call and transferred from cities and government bodies to work in the newly established cooperatives for a long time. Many experienced agronomists voluntarily left well-managed state-owned farms or cooperatives and transferred to new cooperatives to undertake more difficult tasks. In addition, teachers from the Budapest University of Technology designed a large number of architectural drawings for agricultural cooperatives in various places. During the busy summer farming season, two groups of doctors voluntarily went to the countryside to prevent and treat diseases for farmers. More than 20,000 young students used their summer vacation time to participate in labor to support agricultural production.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Bucharest, 26th. Romania has achieved remarkable success in rural electrification.

　　In the sixteen years since the liberation of Romania, through state investment and the farmers' own funds and voluntary labor, more than 3,000 rural areas have been electrified, while only 530 rural areas were electrified during the landlord and bourgeois regime. That is to say, the number of rural areas electrified after liberation is more than four times that before liberation.

　　The budget and mass investment used for rural electrification in Oradea County this year are four times more than last year. Many farmers participated in voluntary labor. In the past eight months, the electrification projects in thirteen rural areas in this county have been completed. Eleven rural areas in Constanța County were electrified in the first half of this year. This county plans to complete the rural electrification of the entire county ahead of schedule in 1965.

　　According to the instructions of the Romanian Workers' Party on the plan for developing the national economy from 1960 to 1965, the speed of rural electrification will be greatly accelerated. During the Six-Year Plan period (1960-1965), more than 4,000 rural areas will be electrified, and the average number of electrified rural areas added each year will be 25% more than all electrified rural areas before liberation. By 1975, all rural areas in Romania will be electrified.

### 匈牙利全民支援农业运动广泛开展  罗马尼亚农村电气化获得显著成绩

　　匈牙利全民支援农业运动广泛开展
　  罗马尼亚农村电气化获得显著成绩
    新华社布达佩斯26日电　在匈牙利，随着近两年来农业合作化的迅速进展而形成的全民支援农业运动，目前正在日益广泛地发展。
    各工业部门为支援农业生产，展开了劳动竞赛。职工们努力挖掘潜力，尽量向农村提供更多的农业机器、化学肥料和建筑材料。去年，全国农业机械的生产提高了35％，今年上半年农业机器的生产计划又超额完成。
    布达佩斯红星拖拉机工厂把生产每台拖拉机的时间缩短了五十小时，并制成一些效率很高的新式农业机器。莫松马乔罗瓦农业机器厂的职工决定在今年把生产提高一倍，并试制十种新型播种机。包尔绍德化学联合工厂上半年已超计划多生产了三千多吨氮肥。
    目前差不多所有的工厂企业、国营农场和机关团体都与农业合作社建立了经常的联系，分别承担协助一个新社的任务。规模较大的工厂企业还同时协助几个合作社。仅布达佩斯市的工厂企业，就负责协助近一千个农业生产合作社。这样，全国所有的新社都得到了经常性的帮助。
    工厂机关的党组织常到农村进行政治宣传工作，帮助建立和发展党组织。工厂机关的党组织的成员并经常参加合作社党组织的会议介绍党的工作经验和工作方法，帮助农村党组织提高农民的社会主义觉悟，克服小农思想与集体所有制之间经常发生的各种矛盾，树立集体主义观点。目前，在吉厄尔—索普伦、索尔诺克和维斯普雷姆等州，所有的合作社都建立了党的基层组织。工厂机关的行政和技术干部经常下乡帮助合作社制定生产和财务计划，改进劳动组织，设计各种建筑图样，购置建筑器材等。
    布达佩斯市和索尔诺克州的机器厂的职工和萨尔哥塔里扬矿区的技术工人劳动队定期下乡为合作社修理机器和农具，同时积极培养社员掌握各种技术。许多工厂的职工还利用假日和休息时间为合作社修建畜舍和安装电灯等。
    在大批新社成立后，很多政治工作者和技术人员响应党的号召，从城市和机关转到新成立的合作社去长期工作。很多有经验的农艺师自愿离开经营工作做得好的国营农场或合作社转到新社去承担较困难的任务。此外，布达佩斯工业大学的教师为各地农业合作社设计了大批的建筑图样。夏季农忙时节，两批医生自动下乡为农民预防和医疗疾病。两万多名青年学生利用暑假的时间参加了支援农业生产的劳动。
    新华社布加勒斯特26日电　罗马尼亚在农村电气化方面获得显著成绩。
    罗马尼亚解放十六年来，通过国家的投资和农民自己的资金和义务劳动，共有三千多个农村实现了电气化，而在地主资产阶级政权年代电气化的农村只有五百三十个。这就是说，解放后电气化的农村比解放前多四倍多。
    俄拉第亚州今年用于农村电气化的预算和群众的投资比去年多四倍。许多农民参加了义务劳动。八个月来，这个州有十三个农村的电气化工程已经完工。康斯坦萨州今年上半年有十一个农村实现了电气化。这个州计划在1965年就提前完成全州的农村电气化任务。
    根据罗马尼亚工人党关于1960—1965年发展国民经济计划的指示，农村电气化的速度还将大大加快。六年计划期间（1960—1965年）又将有四千个以上的农村实现电气化，平均每年所增加的电气化农村将比解放前全部电气化农村还多25％。到1975年，罗马尼亚农村将全部实现电气化。
