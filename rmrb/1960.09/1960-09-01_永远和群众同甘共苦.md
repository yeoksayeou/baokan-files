    Many of our Party's cadres had the style of sharing weal and woe with the masses and practicing diligence and thrift during the past revolutionary war period. Today, in the period of peaceful construction, they still maintain and carry forward this excellent style. The example of the cadres in Baode County, Shanxi Province, is just an ordinary example among thousands upon thousands of such examples.
    The reason why it is important to share weal and woe with the masses is because it is an ideological style that any cadre with a strong mass viewpoint must possess, and it is a necessary condition for closely linking with the masses, relying on the masses, and implementing the Party's mass line. Cadres who can share weal and woe with the masses can put their whole body and mind among the masses, truly integrate with the masses in thought, labor, and life, know the "sweetness" and "bitterness" of the masses, understand what the masses like and oppose, what difficulties they have, and what demands they have, so as to better realize leadership. They understand the masses and are the confidants of the masses, and in turn, the masses also understand them and become their confidants. As long as cadres and the masses are intimately connected, the success of the work will be reliably guaranteed.
    To be able to truly share weal and woe with the masses, the first thing is to truly integrate with the masses in terms of ideological feelings, regard the cause of the masses as one's own personal cause, regard the joy of the masses as one's own joy, regard the difficulties of the masses as one's own difficulties, and completely integrate the interests of the masses with one's own interests. In this way, not only can we share the joy of "sweetness" with the masses in times of victory, but when the masses encounter natural disasters or other unfavorable situations in production and life, we can also immediately step forward, fight alongside the masses, and lead the masses to overcome difficulties. The cadres in Baode County are like this. When the crops of one of their communes suffered a severe hailstorm, the secretary of the commune party committee immediately carried seeds on his back and rushed to the commune overnight to turn the land, collect manure, and replant late autumn crops together with the masses; when floods flooded the houses of the masses, the cadres immediately vacated their houses for the masses to live in. This noble behavior of sharing weal and woe with the masses is precisely a manifestation of the true feelings from the bottom of their hearts, regarding the gains and losses of the masses as their own gains and losses.
    Now, we have thousands upon thousands of cadres who possess the ideological style of sharing weal and woe with the masses, and we require every cadre to be able to do this. Because this will closely link the Party with non-Party cadres and the masses, unite with one heart and one mind, and strive for the greater victory of our common cause.

    永远和群众同甘共苦
    克勤
    我们党的许多干部，在过去革命战争时期，就有着与群众同甘共苦、克勤克俭的作风；在今天和平建设时期，他们依然保持和发扬了这种优良作风。山西省保德县干部的事例，就是这种千千万万事例中普通的一例。
    和群众同甘共苦之所以重要，是因为它是任何一个有强烈的群众观点的干部所必需具备的思想作风，是密切联系群众、依靠群众、贯彻党的群众路线所必需具备的条件。能够和群众同甘共苦的干部，才能把自己的全副身心放置于群众当中，真正和群众在思想上、劳动上、生活上打成一片，知道群众的“甘”和“苦”，懂得群众喜欢什么，反对什么，有些什么困难，又有些什么要求，从而更好地实现领导。他们懂得群众，是群众的知心朋友，反过来，群众也懂得他们，成了他们的知心朋友。只要干部和群众亲密无间，工作的成功就有了可靠保证。
    要能真正和群众同甘共苦，首先要在思想感情上真正和群众打成一片。把群众的事业当成自己的切身的事业，把群众的欢乐当成自己的欢乐，把群众的困难当成自己的困难，把群众的利益和自己的利益完全融合在一起。这样，就不仅在胜利的时候，和群众共享“甘”的欢乐，在群众生产、生活遇到自然灾害或其他不顺利情况时，也能立即挺身而出，和群众一起战斗，领导群众，战胜困难。保德县的干部就是这样的。他们有一个公社的庄稼遭到严重雹灾，公社党委书记立即背着种籽，星夜赶去，和群众一起翻地、淘粪，补种晚秋；洪水漫了群众的房子，干部立即腾出房子，给群众住。这种和群众同甘共苦的高尚行为，正是发自内心的、把群众的利害得失当成自己的利害得失的真实感情的表现。
    现在，我们有千千万万的干部具备了和群众同甘共苦的思想作风，我们要求每一个干部都能作到这样。因为这就会使党与非党干部和群众紧紧联系在一起，同心同德，为我们共同事业的更大胜利而奋斗。
