　　My Apprentice
　　Anshan Iron and Steel Worker Ning Nan

　　Dusk fell, but my apprentice, Hong Shumin, was still frowning, squatting in front of the automatic drilling machine that hadn't been successfully completed, showing no sign of leaving. It was already six o'clock, and Shumin still had his train ticket for 8 p.m. tonight in his pocket! I urged him to leave several times, but he just said he wasn't in a hurry and wouldn't go. Alas! The young man was fascinated by the automatic drilling machine I proposed!
　　Five days ago, he received a transfer order to return to the South, and came to tell me with a frown. I thought to myself, the young man had been learning skills from me for more than a year, and we got along very well as master and apprentice. This time, he must be reluctant to leave. Who knew that he would say, "Master, what should I do? It looks like I can't help you get the automatic drilling machine to succeed!" Hey, this made me happy instead. I could tell that the young man had a strong sense of career! I replied, "What to do? Handle your formalities and happily go back to your hometown to build the steel plant. When this automatic drilling machine is successful, I will write to you!"
　　In the past five days, the young man has been busy, handling formalities and shipping luggage. Whenever he had time, he would run to me. This afternoon, he said he was here to say goodbye, but before we had talked for ten sentences, he started to roll up his sleeves and get to work. This was the last time, and he hoped to make the automatic drilling machine successful. Now only the transmission problem remained, and there was hope to solve it today….
　　The sky gradually darkened, and the electric lights were turned on in front of each lathe. I looked at my watch again: "Oh dear, it's seven o'clock!" We couldn't delay any longer. I just said "Go!" and ordered him to wash his hands. I picked up the net bag and put the schoolbag on his shoulder, practically dragging him to the station.
　　On the platform of the station, it was crowded with people, all saying goodbye to beloved Anshan Iron and Steel: At this moment, I was thinking about Shumin, and words poured out like a river bursting its banks, saying this and that, but in fact, it all boiled down to one thing: "Go back and work excellently!" He, on the other hand, first responded with "Um, um," but later fell silent. Was he sad because he was about to leave us? I looked at him carefully, oh dear, this young man's mind had already wandered off. Look at his eyes, staring straight at the locomotive on the distant side track!
　　"Woo—", a train from the north whistled through the air. The locomotive "hissed" and puffed out steam, and the four big wheels "clanged, clanged" as they rolled along. Suddenly, a young man of medium build beside me darted forward a few steps, making my heart jump wildly. I quickly reached out to grab him, and grabbed a bulging schoolbag. "Oh dear, it's him!" I shouted loudly, "Shumin, this is not your train!" He seemed not to hear and took two more steps forward. Just then, "Hiss—", the locomotive brushed past. At this moment, Shumin turned around, yelled at the top of his lungs, and said with a big smile, "Master, I've got it—I'm not leaving—Haha, I've got it!"—What was he talking about! Without waiting for me to ask, he grabbed me and ran out of the platform in a hurry, rushing to the ticket window and persuading them to sign the ticket to change it to tomorrow! Turning back, he finally calmed down and said, "Master, did you notice the rod that connects the four big wheels under the locomotive, that rod—
　　"That's called a connecting rod!" I pointed out to him with a bit of annoyance. This young man actually risked danger to look at such a connecting rod, I really had to criticize him.
　　"Um, Master, look," he used the schoolbag as a drawing board, took out chalk and drew while saying, "In this way, wouldn't the transmission problem be solved?"
　　"You thought of a great idea!" The criticisms that I had been preparing in my mind turned a hundred and eighty degrees the moment I spoke.
　　Late at night, on my watch, the long and short hands were again standing straight in a line—half past twelve. In the distance, the blast furnace from time to time emitted giant-like roars, and the electric locomotives joyfully cheered. In our workshop, there was a burst of machine noise. In this boiling moment of labor, as a new day was just dawning, our automatic drilling machine was successful! Watching the drill bit, like a ten-foot spear, automatically drill forward, Shumin wiped his sweaty face and said to me in a relaxed tone: "Master, now I can go!" Look at his air, as if he had just gotten my permission.

　　我的徒弟
　　鞍钢工人　宁南
    黄昏了，我的徒弟洪树民，仍然紧锁着眉头，蹲在那还没弄成功的自动钻眼机前，丝毫没有走的意思。现在已经六点了，树民的怀里还揣着今晚八点钟的火车票呢！我撵了他好几回，他只说不忙，怎么也不走。唉！小伙子被我提的这项自动钻眼机迷住啦！
    五天前，他接到了回南方的调令，锁着个眉头来告诉我。我寻思，小伙子跟我学手艺一年多，师徒俩处得挺好，这回准是舍不得走啦。哪知道，他开口就这样说：“师傅，怎么办？眼看着不能帮你把自动钻眼机搞成功！”嘿，这一说反倒使我高兴，听得出来，小伙子的事业心还挺重哩！我答说：“怎么办？办你的手续，高高兴兴回家乡建设钢厂。这台自动钻眼机搞成功了，我准写信告诉你！”
    五天当中，小伙子紧忙活，又是办手续，又是托运行李，一有空，就跑到我这里来。今天下午，他说是来向我辞行的，没谈上十句话，他就磨拳擦掌地干起来，这是最后一次了，他希望把自动钻眼机搞成功。现在就剩个传动的问题了，今天有希望解决这个问题的……。
    天，逐渐地暗下来了，一台台车床前都扭亮了电灯。我又一次看表：“喔唷，不好，七点了！”再也不能耽误了，我只讲了声“走！”就命令他洗手。我提起网兜，把书包套在他的肩上，简直是拉着他，向车站奔去。
    车站的月台上，熙熙攘攘尽是人，都向亲爱的鞍钢告别：此刻我就想着树民啦，话儿就像河水开了坝，讲了这又说那，其实，颠来倒去，也不过一个意思：“回去要出色地干活！”他呢，先还“嗯，嗯”地应着，后来，没声了。是他因为即将离开我们而难过了吗？我注意看看他，嗳哟，这小伙子思想早溜号啦，看他那一双眼睛，直勾勾地死盯着远远岔道上的火车头呢！
      “呜——”，北面来的一列车划空长啸。火车头“嘶，嘶”喷吐出蒸汽，那四个大轮儿“啌咣、啌咣”旋转着滚来。突然，我身边一个中等身材的小伙子向前窜出几步，把我的心儿急得咕咚咚猛跳一阵，忙伸出手去抓，一抓，抓住个鼓鼓囊囊的书包，“嗳哟，是他！”我大声喊道：“树民，你乘的不是这列车！”他呢，像是没听见，又向前跨了两步。说时迟，那时快，“嘶——”，火车头擦面而过。这时候，树民转过身来，炸着嗓子，眉开眼笑地叫道：“师傅，师傅，有了——不走了——哈哈，有了！”——这是啥话！也没容
  我细问，他一把抓着我飞步跑出站台，紧赶着到售票口，说好说歹在票上签了字，改作明天走！回过头来，他才定了定神，说道：“师傅，你注意到火车头下，串着四个大轮子的那根，那根——
      “那叫拉杆！”我带点气地指点他，这毛头小伙子，居然冒着危险去看那么一根拉杆，真要好好批评他一下。
      “嗯，师傅你看，”他把书包当图纸，掏出粉笔来一边画着，一边说道：“这样，传动的问题不就解决了吗？”
      “你想得真好！”我原先装了一肚子的批评话，哪晓得出口第一句就转了个一百八十度。
      深夜，我的表上，长短针又是竖竖一道线儿——十二点半了。远处，高炉不时发出巨人般的呼啸，电机车兴高彩烈地欢叫着。咱们的车间里，则是一片机床喧闹声。就在这沸腾的劳动时刻里，新的一天刚刚到来的时候，我们的自动钻眼机成功了！眼望着那似丈八蛇矛的钻头自动地向前钻进，树民才揩一揩汗涔涔的脸，用一种轻松的语调对我说道：“师傅，这下我可以走啦！”瞧那神气，仿佛才得到我同意似的。
