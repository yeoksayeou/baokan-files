    Good News for Winter Heating
    Saving a few pounds of coal may seem insignificant from the perspective of a single household or a small unit, but from the perspective of the entire nation, it is a major matter.
    Coal is not only a necessity of life but also a very important means of production. People often say: "With coal, there is iron; with iron, there is steel." Every ton of coal saved in domestic use means that production can increase by a corresponding amount. In recent years, various localities have created many methods and furnace types for saving coal when burning fires. The hot air furnace promoted in Shenyang is one such example. The characteristics of this furnace are: easy to manufacture, and saves a considerable amount of coal. Manufacturing this type of furnace only requires bricks, mud, and ceramic pipes, without the need for cast iron or thin iron. On average, it saves about 30% of coal. If the whole country universally pays attention to saving coal and adopts furnace types that save more coal, the total amount saved will be very considerable.
    For thousands of years, most urban residents have only been accustomed to small furnaces in individual households, burning their own fires for heating. After the communization, women participated in work, and the problem of family heating must be replaced by advanced forms. With hot air furnaces, one household can burn the fire and several households can be heated, so that employees whose homes are unattended can also have a warm and comfortable environment after getting off work. The emergence of the Shenyang hot air furnace has precisely become a better form of solving the heating problem for urban residents after communization.
    Now, the weather in the north is gradually getting colder, and the severe winter is approaching. The issue of heating for employees has been placed on people's daily agenda. Solving the heating problem well not only saves coal for the country but also allows employees to have a warm environment to comfortably recover from the day's fatigue and have more energy to devote to production the next day.
    Arranging heating work early is a political task for all departments. It is hoped that all areas with the necessary conditions will refer to the experience of Shenyang, adapt to local conditions, and use local materials to prepare for furnace construction, ensuring that people spend the winter in warmth and comfort.

### 冬季取暖的好消息

    冬季取暖的好消息
    节约几斤煤炭，从一家一户或一个小单位看来，似乎算不了什么，但是，从整个国家来看，确是一件大事情。
    煤炭，不只是生活资料，而且是很重要的生产资料。人们常说：有煤才有铁，有铁才有钢。生活用煤多节约一吨，生产上就可以多增加一分力量。近几年来，各地创造了不少节约煤炭的烧火方法和炉型。沈阳市推广的热风炉就是其中的一种。这种炉子的特点：制造方便，省煤较多。制造这种炉子只用砖和泥、陶瓷管，不要铸铁和薄铁。平均节约煤炭30％左右，如果全国普遍注意节约用煤，并采用省煤较多的炉型，总数是十分可观的。
    千百年来，大部分城市居民只习惯于一家一户一个小炉子，自己烧火自己取暖。公社化以后，妇女们参加了工作，而家庭的取暖问题，就必须有先进的形式来代替。有了热风炉，就可以在一家烧火，几家取暖，使家里没有人照料的职工下班以后，也能有温暖舒适的环境。沈阳热风炉的出现，恰恰成为公社化以后解决市民取暖问题的较好形式。
    现在，北方的天气渐冷，严寒的冬天就要来临。职工取暖问题已经放到人们的生活日程上来了。取暖问题解决得好，不仅为国家节约了煤炭，而且使职工可以有温暖的环境，舒适地恢复一天的疲劳，到第二天有更充沛的精力投入生产。
    及早安排取暖工作是各部门一项政治任务。希望一切有条件的地区参考沈阳的经验，因地制宜，就地取材，做好建炉准备，保证人们温暖舒适地度过冬季。
