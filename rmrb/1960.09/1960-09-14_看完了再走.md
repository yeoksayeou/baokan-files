    Watch Until the End Before Leaving	Qin Li
    Recently, after seeing several plays in a row, I noticed a phenomenon in some theaters: as the play neared its end, with the performance on stage reaching a tense and exciting climax, and the audience absorbed in watching, some people would suddenly get up in twos and threes and leave. Immediately, the sound of seats flapping, footsteps, and boos from other audience members dissatisfied with these early leavers, disrupted the majority of the audience's concentration. This particularly affected the performance of the actors on stage. And when the actors enthusiastically bowed repeatedly to the audience, those impatient people had already walked out of the theater door. Although this is a small matter in cultural life, it should be said that it is a bad habit brought from the old society by a very small number of people, showing a lack of respect for the labor of the actors and disregard for the collective appreciation of the audience.
    In socialist society, every kind of ordinary labor should be respected by the people. The actors have worked hard on stage for several hours, shouldn't their labor be respected? At the same time, as a member of the audience, since you have spent time going to the theater to appreciate art, you should abide by the theater's rules, because this is a public place, and social relationships have been established between people, so you should even more establish a sense of collectivism, and should not just think of yourself and "walk away proudly"! In addition, this phenomenon also exists in cinemas, and we should also promote the spirit of collectivism, and remain seated until the end of the film before leaving. At the same time, I also hope that the plays can be as compact and short as possible. It is best to end by 10 or 10:30, so as not to cause the audience to worry about transportation.

    看完了再走	秦犁
    最近，接连几次看戏，见到有些剧场里出现这样一种现象：戏到了快要终场的时候，舞台上正演得紧张热烈，大家正聚精会神地看戏，观众席上忽然有人三三两两地起身往外走。顿时，座位的啪达啪达响声、人的走步声，和别的观众对这些早退者不满而发出的嘘声，扰乱得大多数观众无法集中精神看完戏。特别是影响到舞台上演员的演出。而当演员们热情地一再向观众谢幕的时候，那些性急的人已经走出剧场大门了。这虽然是文化生活里的一件小事情，但应该说是极少数人从旧社会带来的不尊重演员劳动、不顾观众集体欣赏的坏习惯。
    在社会主义社会里，任何一种平凡的劳动都应受到人们的尊敬。演员们在舞台上辛苦地表演了几个小时，他们的这种劳动难道不应该受到尊重吗？同时，作为一个观众，既然花费了时间到剧场去欣赏艺术，就应该遵守剧场秩序，因为这是在公共场所，人和人之间已经构成了社会关系，因而就更应该树立集体主义观念，而不应该只顾自己地“扬长而去”！此外，在电影院里，也有这种现象，也应该发扬集体主义精神，看完了电影再行离座。同时，我也希望戏要尽量演得紧凑一些，短一些。最好十点或十点半就能结束，以免观众为交通工具而操心。
