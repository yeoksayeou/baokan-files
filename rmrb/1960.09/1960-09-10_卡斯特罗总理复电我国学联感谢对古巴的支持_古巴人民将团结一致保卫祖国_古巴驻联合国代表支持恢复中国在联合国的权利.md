Xinhua News Agency, September 9th: The All-China Students' Federation received a telegram from Fidel Castro, Premier of the Cuban Revolutionary Government. In the telegram, Premier Castro expressed his gratitude to the ACFS for supporting the Cuban people, the Cuban Revolutionary Government, and himself in the struggle against U.S. imperialism. He pointed out that the Cuban people, led by farmers, workers, and civilians, will continue to unite under the slogan "A free country or death."

The full text of Premier Castro's telegram is as follows:
Beijing, All-China Students' Federation,

Your warm telegram of greetings to the Cuban people, sent on the occasion of the grand national rally held in Havana last Friday, September 2nd, has been received. On behalf of the Cuban people, their Revolutionary Government, and myself, I sincerely thank you for your support and encouragement in our struggle against U.S. imperialism. U.S. imperialism is exerting political and economic influence on the governments of those intimidated Latin American countries, attempting to isolate our revolution, harm the interests of underdeveloped countries, and restore its monopolies and large estate ownership in our country. To answer the Declaration of San José, Costa Rica, the Cuban people issued the Havana Declaration to express their absolute and complete sovereignty. You will receive a copy of the declaration by mail. The Cuban people, led by farmers, workers, and civilians, will continue to unite under the slogan "A free country or death."

Dr. Fidel Castro
Premier of the Cuban Revolutionary Government
September 8, 1960

Xinhua News Agency, Havana, September 8th:  Yesterday, the Cuban Permanent Representative to the United Nations, Manuel Bisbe, said when he left for New York to attend the United Nations General Assembly, "Cuba will support disarmament, the independence of Algeria, and China's entry into the United Nations." He added that the Cuban delegation will also protest against U.S. imperialist aggression against Cuba.

Speaking on the issue of disarmament, Bisbe said that Cuba would strive for the destruction and cessation of the production of nuclear weapons. He pointed out that the U.S.'s demand for supervision in order to oppose the Soviet Union's plan for general and complete disarmament was an attempt to conduct espionage.

Speaking on China, Bisbe said, "It is absurd and contrary to common sense that a country with a population of six hundred million is not in the United Nations." Finally, he said that Cuba would vote in favor of Algerian independence, as the Algerian people are taking up arms to fight because some people are preventing them from gaining freedom.

Xinhua News Agency, Havana, September 8th:  Today, the Cuban "Revolución" newspaper condemned Eisenhower's absurd statement that the Cuban Revolutionary Government's decision to establish diplomatic relations with the People's Republic of China was "a very serious mistake." The newspaper said that for the representative of U.S. imperialism, "anything that signifies the self-determination and sovereignty of all nations is a mistake."

The newspaper listed a large number of examples of the U.S. government's aggression against Cuba, and emphasized that the U.S. uses these actions to "endanger the tranquility of the people of many countries, undermine the happiness and development of many countries, and threaten world peace."

The newspaper particularly emphasized that, on the contrary, "recognizing the People's Republic of China poses no danger to all of this, but only disturbs the nerves of U.S. imperialism and U.S. exploitative companies, who have increasingly become aware of their decline in the world."

    卡斯特罗总理来电的全文如下：北京　中华全国学生联合会
    你们借9月2日上星期五在哈瓦那举行盛大的全国大会之际向古巴人民致意的热诚的来电业已收到。我谨代表古巴人民、他们的革命政府和我自己真诚地感谢你们对我们反对美帝国主义斗争的支持和鼓舞。美帝国主义向那些被吓倒了的拉丁美洲国家的政府施加政治和经济影响，力图孤立我们的革命、损害那些不发达国家的利益并恢复它在我国的垄断和大庄园所有权。为了回答哥斯达黎加圣约瑟宣言，古巴人民发表了哈瓦那宣言，以表示他们享有绝对和完全的主权。你们将接到付邮寄去的宣言的副本。由农民、工人和平民领导的古巴人民，将继续在“一切为了自由的国家否则毋宁死”的口号下团结一致。

    新华社哈瓦那8日电　古巴驻联合国常任代表曼努埃尔·比斯维昨天动身赴纽约参加联合国大会时发表谈话说，“古巴将支持裁军、阿尔及利亚的独立和中国进入联合国。”他又说，古巴代表团也将对美帝国主义侵略古巴提出抗议。
    比斯维在谈到裁军问题时说，古巴将争取销毁和停止生产核武器。他指出，美国为了反对苏联的普遍全面裁军计划而提出的关于监督的要求是企图进行间谍活动。
    比斯维在谈到中国时说，“一个拥有六亿人口的国家没有进入联合国是荒谬和违背常理的。”最后他说，古巴将投票支持阿尔及利亚独立，阿尔及利亚人民正由于有人不让他们得到自由而拿起武器进行斗争。
    新华社哈瓦那8日电　古巴“革命报”今天谴责艾森豪威尔把古巴革命政府同中华人民共和国建立外交关系的决定说成是“一个非常严重的错误”的谰言。报纸说，对美帝国主义的代表说来，“任何意味着各国人民的自决和主权的东西都是错误”。
    报纸列举了美国政府侵略古巴的大量事例，并强调指出，美国就是用这种行动“把很多国家人民的安宁置于险境，破坏许多国家的幸福和发展，并且威胁着世界的和平”。
    报纸特别强调指出，与此相反，“承认中华人民共和国对这一切都毫无危险，而只是扰乱了美帝国主义和美国的剥削公司的神经，它们已日益觉察到自己在世界上的没落”。
