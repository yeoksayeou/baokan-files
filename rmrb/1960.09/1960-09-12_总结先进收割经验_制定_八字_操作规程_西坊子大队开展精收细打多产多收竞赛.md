    This dispatch from Tianjin, September 11th, reports that wheat, oats, and other crops are ripe in the Bashang Grassland area of Hebei Province. The Xifangzi Production Brigade of Shangduzhen Commune, in order to achieve fine harvesting and careful threshing to bring every grain home, started with mobilizing the masses and summarizing harvesting experiences, formulated "eight-character" harvesting operating procedures, and launched a production increase and frugality movement centered on fine harvesting and careful threshing, which achieved good results.

    This year, because the members of the Xifangzi Brigade firmly established the idea of agriculture as the foundation and vigorously developing agriculture and grain production, the vast number of cadres and the masses paid attention to fine harvesting and careful threshing from the beginning of the autumn harvest. Harvesting was generally more meticulous than in previous years. The brigade's Party General Branch was not satisfied with the existing harvesting level. While most of the crops had not yet been harvested, they conducted a major inspection in a timely manner. During the inspection, it was found that 30 mu of wheat in the Dongfangzi Team were not harvested cleanly, and 10 jin of grain were picked up per mu. In another field that was considered to have been harvested cleanly, 4.5 jin of grain were picked up per mu. Because the Xiaohaizi Team had specific and feasible measures and harvested meticulously, there was very little grain loss. After careful gleaning and sweeping, 1.5 jin of grain was picked up per mu. After a comprehensive investigation and analysis, it was found that 10% of the land already harvested by the entire brigade lost 8 to 10 jin of grain per mu, 70% lost 3 to 4 jin, and 20% lost 1 to 2 jin. The Party General Branch believed that this year's harvest was indeed more meticulous than in previous years, but judging from the imbalance between the teams, there was still great potential to harvest more grain as long as they persisted in fine harvesting and careful threshing.

    The Party General Branch announced the inspection situation and the problem of grain loss to the masses. Most people thought the problem was serious, but some individual cadres and the masses thought the problem was not big. In order to solve this problem, the Party General Branch launched a mass debate through calculating detailed accounts on the question of "Is losing a few jin of grain per mu a big problem or a small problem?" In the discussion, many people believed that "this year's grain is a bumper harvest, which is the result of everyone's labor for a year, and not a single grain should be lost." Wang Tingxuan, a member of the Dongfangzi Team, said: "High-rise buildings are built with bricks and tiles, and fine hair can be felted. Losing a few jin of grain per mu is not much, but it is a big problem when the area is large." Zhao Rui, the deputy secretary of the Party General Branch, calculated a detailed account of fine harvesting and careful threshing with everyone: the entire brigade has 59,000 mu of land. Calculated at 4 jin of grain lost per mu, 236,000 jin of grain would be lost. As the saying goes, "An oil lamp is not bright if it is not adjusted, and a road is not clear if it is not traveled." After this calculation, everyone further realized the importance of fine harvesting and careful threshing.

    In order to study whether the phenomenon of grain loss could be avoided, the Party General Branch summarized the harvesting experience of the Xiaohaizi Production Team, criticized the idea that a little loss is unavoidable with facts, so that the masses realized that as long as they cherish grain and harvest carefully, the phenomenon of grain loss can be avoided. On the basis of raising the consciousness of the masses, the masses were mobilized to find loopholes in grain loss and offer suggestions for fine harvesting and careful threshing, and a relatively complete set of "eight-character" operating procedures for fine harvesting and careful threshing was formulated. These "eight-character" operating procedures are:

    Suitable: Harvest at the right time. Generally, crops should be harvested when they are 80% ripe, and buckwheat should be pulled when it is 70% ripe, so as to harvest one piece when it is ripe. Cut: Cut cleanly, rake each furrow cleanly, cut lightly, and put down lightly. When cutting, hold the stalks instead of the ears to avoid dropping grains. Bundle: Bundle the same day as cutting. Bundle small and tight to ensure that the bundles do not come undone. Stack: Stack the crops in high and dry places. Stack single first and then double for ventilation to prevent moisture and mildew. Transport: Load and unload lightly, load well, and the bottom of the cart should be tight. Crops that are easy to lose grains, such as buckwheat, should be transported in the morning and evening when it is damp. People should carry less and walk faster when carrying crops on their backs, and do not rest in the middle to avoid rubbing and scattering grains. Pile: The crop piles should be piled small, well, and firmly, and piled in a pyramid shape to prevent collapse and waste of grain. Roll (thresh): Dry and roll cleanly (generally, crops must be rolled twice), shake cleanly, winnow cleanly, sweep cleanly, and pick up cleanly. Millet should have the ears cut off cleanly, and yams should have the eggs picked up cleanly. Protect: People going to the fields should combine plugging rat holes and digging up huangkang (grain stolen by yellow ground squirrels in their holes), and livestock transporting and threshing should wear muzzles.

    In order to implement the above measures and earnestly achieve fine harvesting, careful threshing, increased production and more harvests, brigade and team cadres and Party and League members have gone to the front line of the autumn harvest, contracting harvesting groups and threshing grounds, working with the masses, and discussing solutions to problems together. Cadres and members have implemented the "four fix" production responsibility system in harvesting. Each team has established inspection and acceptance groups, and each work group has selected two inspectors. The work of the day is inspected and accepted according to the operating procedures on the same day. Those who pass are recorded work points according to the quota, and those who fail are reworked and criticized and educated. A competition for fine harvesting and careful threshing was launched among the masses. The brigade conducts a major inspection and appraisal at the end of each battle, the teams appraise every five days, and the work groups appraise every three days. Now, the entire brigade has emerged with four advanced teams, thirteen advanced groups, and 136 advanced members for fine harvesting and careful threshing, creating a general atmosphere of fine harvesting and careful threshing among the vast number of cadres and the masses. Member Wang Tingxuan carried a bag with him when cultivating the land, and picked up any scattered grain he saw on the road or in the field and handed it over to the team. After the members paid more attention to fine harvesting, the phenomenon of grain loss has been greatly reduced. In the past, forty children in the Dongfangzi Team picked up half a cart of wheat ears in a day, but now they only pick up half a basket in a day. (Attached picture)

    总结先进收割经验  制定“八字”操作规程
    西坊子大队开展精收细打多产多收竞赛
    本报天津11日电　河北省霸上草原地区一年一度的小麦、莜麦等作物成熟了。商都镇公社西坊子生产大队，为了在收获工作中作到精收细打，颗粒还家，这个大队从深入发动群众，总结收割经验入手，制订了“八字”收割操作规程，开展了以精收细打为中心的增产节约运动，收到了良好效果。
    今年西坊子大队的社员由于坚定地树立了以农业为基础，大办农业，大办粮食的思想，秋收一开始，广大干部、群众就注意了精收细打，一般地收割都比往年细致。大队党总支并不满足现有的收割水平，趁大部分庄稼还未收割，及时地进行了一次大检查。在检查中发现，东坊子小队有三十亩小麦收割的不净，一亩地就拾回了十斤粮食；在另一块认为收割净了的地里，一亩地也拾回了四斤半粮食。小海子小队因为措施具体可行，收割细致，丢粮很少，经过仔细的拾穗、扫粒，在一亩地里也拾回了一斤半粮食。经过全面调查分析，全大队已收割过的地，每亩丢撒粮食八斤到十斤的占10％，丢三、四斤的占70％，丢一、二斤的占20％。党总支认为，今年收割确比往年细致，但是从各队不平衡情况看，只要坚持精收细打，再多收一些粮食，潜力还是很大的。
    党总支把检查的情况和丢撒粮食的问题向群众一公布，大部分认为问题严重，但也有个别干部和群众认为问题不算大。为了解决这个问题，党总支就“每亩地丢撒几斤粮食是大问题还是小问题？”发动群众通过算细账，组织了大鸣大放大讨论。在讨论中，不少人认为：“今年的粮食虽然丰收，是大家劳动一年换来的，一粒粮食也不该丢掉。”东坊子小队社员王庭瑄说：“楼房虽高也是一块砖一片瓦盖起来的，牛毛虽细能擀毡，一亩地丢几斤粮食不多，面积大了就是大问题。”党总支副书记赵瑞同志和大家一起算了一笔精收细打的账；全大队有五万九千亩地，按一亩地丢撒粮食四斤计算，就要丢撒粮食二十三万六千斤。常说：“油灯不拨不亮，道路不走不明”，经过这样一算，大家进一步认识到精收细打的重要性。
    为了研究丢撒粮食的现象能不能避免的问题，党总支总结了小海子生产小队收割的经验，用事实批判了丢点难免的思想，从而使群众认识到：只要珍惜粮食，细心收割，丢撒粮食的现象是可以避免的。在提高群众觉悟的基础上，就如何精收细打的问题，发动群众，通过边找丢粮漏洞，边献策献计，制订了一套比较完整的精收细打“八字”操作规程。这“八字”操作规程是：
    适：适时收割。一般庄稼熟到八成就割，荞麦熟到七成就拔，做到熟一片割一片。割：割净、逐垅搂净，轻割、轻放。割的时候，捉秆不捉穗，以免掉粒。捆：当天割当天捆。捆小、捆紧，保证不开腰。码：庄稼个子要码在高处和干处。先码单后码双，便于通风，防止潮湿霉坏粮食。运：拉运要轻装轻卸，装好，车底板要严实。易掉粒的庄稼，如荞麦等要在早晚趁潮拉运。人背庄稼要少背快走，中途不息，以免揉搓撒粒。垛：庄稼垛要垛小、垛好、垛实，垛成塔字形，以免倒塌糟践粮食。碾（打）：晒干碾净（一般庄稼都要碾两遍），抖净、扬净、扫净、起净，谷子要切净穗，山药要起净蛋。护：下地人要结合堵鼠洞，挖黄扛（黄鼠盗在洞里的粮食），拉运和碾场的牲畜都要带笼嘴。
    为了贯彻执行上述措施、认真做到精收细打多产多收，大队和小队干部、党团员都深入到秋收第一线，包收割组、包碾场，同群众一起劳动，一块商量解决问题。干部和社员在收割中，都实行了“四定”生产责任制。各小队建立了检查验收小组，每个作业组都选出了两名检查验收员，当天的活当天按操作规程进行检查验收，合格的按定额记工分，不合格的返工，并且进行批评教育。在群众中开展了精收细打竞赛。大队在一个战役末进行一次大检查大评比，小队五天一评比，作业组三天一评比。现在全大队已涌现出精收细打先进小队四个，先进小组十三个，先进社员一百三十六名，在广大干部、群众中普遍造成了精收细打的风气。社员王庭瑄耕地带着口袋，在路上、地里见了丢撒的粮食就拾回来交队。社员进一步注意精收后，丢撒粮食的现象很少了。东坊子小队四十名儿童过去一天拾麦穗半车，现在一天仅拾半筐。（附图片）
