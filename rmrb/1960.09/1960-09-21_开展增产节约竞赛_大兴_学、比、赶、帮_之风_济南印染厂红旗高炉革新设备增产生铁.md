Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, 20th – The iron smelting workers of the 3.66 cubic meter small blast furnace in the smelting workshop of the Jinan Printing and Dyeing Factory, one of the national Red Flag Blast Furnaces, are raising the red flag of high quality, high yield, and low consumption even higher in the movement for increasing production and practicing thrift. This small blast furnace had already completed its annual iron production plan ahead of schedule on September 4. On the basis of steadily improving production levels, the pig iron qualification rate from September 1 to 7 reached 100%, and the coke ratio was 0.658.

In the emulation drive for increased production and thrift, all the workers in the workshop promoted a strong atmosphere of "learn, compare, catch up, help." When Team A's production was leading, Team B's workers would promptly study and analyze Team A's advantages and go to the furnace side during their spare time to learn and observe. After Team B seriously studied Team A, their iron production level quickly caught up with and even surpassed Team A. At this time, the workers of Team A and Team C would come to Team B to "learn from experience" and summarize and promote Team B's experience. Because the three teams learned from each other with modesty, chased each other, and caught up with each other, the pig iron production level of each team generally improved.

The workers further developed the communist spirit, not only did all the work types within the team work together with one heart and one mind and closely cooperate, but also the teams broke down barriers and actively created favorable conditions for the next team's production. In addition, the workers also fundamentally reformed the shift handover system. In the past, shifts would not be handed over if the furnace condition was not smooth, if there were not enough materials prepared, or if the tools were incomplete. Now, it has been changed to "three no handovers," which has powerfully promoted the continuous growth of iron smelting production.

### 开展增产节约竞赛　大兴“学、比、赶、帮”之风　济南印染厂红旗高炉革新设备增产生铁

　　开展增产节约竞赛　大兴“学、比、赶、帮”之风
　　济南印染厂红旗高炉革新设备增产生铁
    据新华社济南20日电　全国红旗高炉之一济南印染厂冶炼车间三点六六立方米小高炉的炼铁工人，在增产节约运动中，把优质、高产、低耗的红旗越举越高。这座小高炉已经在9月4日提前完成全年产铁计划。在生产水平稳步提高的基础上，9月1日至7日的生铁合格率达到100％，焦比为零点六五八。
    在增产节约竞赛中，全车间职工大兴“学、比、赶、帮”之风。当甲班生产领先的时候，乙班工人就及时地研究分析甲班的优点，并在业余时间到炉旁去学习观摩。乙班认真学习甲班后，产铁水平很快就赶上以至超过了甲班。这时，甲班和丙班的工人就来乙班“取经”，总结推行乙班的经验。由于三班之间互相虚心学习，你追我赶，使生铁班产水平普遍提高。
    工人们进一步发扬共产主义风格，不但班内各工种同心协力，密切配合，班与班之间也打破界限，都主动地为下一班生产创造有利条件。此外，工人们还从根本上改革了交接班制度，过去是：炉况不顺不接、备料不够不接、工具不全不接，现已改为“三不交”，有力地促进了炼铁生产的不断增长。
