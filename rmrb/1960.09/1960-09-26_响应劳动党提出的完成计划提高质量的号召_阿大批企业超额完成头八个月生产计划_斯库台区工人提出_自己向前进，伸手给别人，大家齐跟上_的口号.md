Xinhua News Agency, Tirana, September 25th: More than 250 enterprises throughout Albania have completed or overfulfilled their production plans for the first eight months of this year ahead of schedule.

In this regard, the Albanian capital Tirana, and the industrial cities of Vlorë and Shkodër, as well as the districts of Fier, Peshkopi, and Mirditë, are at the forefront. They have won the red flags of excellence for cities and districts in the national socialist production competition. The Bulqizë chrome mine, the Stalin Textile Combine, and the Enver Hoxha Ironworks, which have always maintained advanced titles, are all at the forefront of production this time.

The workers of the Bulqizë chrome mine completed their production tasks for the first eight months of this year as early as August 14th. They over-extracted 3,221 tons of chromite ore. The workers of the Enver Hoxha Ironworks not only completed the original plan in eight months but also produced products worth 1.83 million leks (Albanian currency) more for the country. The staff of the Stalin Textile Combine not only completed the increased production targets for January to August this year but also produced 314,500 meters more textiles, which is 761,000 meters more than the same period last year.

The two industrial cities of Shkodër and Vlorë increased production by more than 125 million leks in eight months. The Shkodër Brick and Tile Factory increased production by 1.73 million bricks and tiles, exceeding the original guarantee by more than 220,000.

In the production of the first eight months of this year, Albanian workers not only actively responded to the call of the Albanian Labor Party to complete the plan and improve quality but also achieved both increased production and savings. For example, the workers of the Kurbnesh Copper Mine not only increased the production of copper ore by more than 500 tons in eight months but also saved more than 80,000 leks for the country. The young workers in the two oil cities of Stalin and Patos launched activities to collect scattered crude oil. So far, they have collected 1,600 tons of crude oil. Lumberjacks in the Korça mountains, based on the principle of rational use of wood, used scattered wood to produce more than 3,000 quintals of charcoal and processed more than 2,000 meters of wood, adding 3.96 million leks of wealth to the country. In the first eight months of this year, the vast number of employees actively put forward rationalization proposals. According to the statistics of Shkodër district alone, workers put forward 644 rationalization proposals in eight months, of which 434 have been adopted. These suggestions can create 3.5 million leks of wealth for the country. The workers of the local state-owned sundries industrial company in this district even put forward the slogan "Advance yourself, extend a hand to others, and everyone keep up," and widely exchanged advanced experiences with others.

    响应劳动党提出的完成计划提高质量的号召
　　阿大批企业超额完成头八个月生产计划
    斯库台区工人提出“自己向前进，伸手给别人，大家齐跟上”的口号
    新华社地拉那25日电　阿尔巴尼亚全国已有二百五十多个企业提前和超额完成了今年头八个月的生产计划。
    在这方面，阿尔巴尼亚首都地拉那和发罗那、斯库台两个工业城市以及费里、佩什科比和米尔迪塔三个区走在前列。它们在全国社会主义生产竞赛中荣获了城和区的优胜红旗。一向保持先进称号的布尔契兹铬矿、斯大林纺织联合厂和恩维尔·霍查铁工厂，这一次都站在生产的最前列。
    布尔契兹铬矿工人早在8月14日就完成了今年头八个月的生产任务。他们超额开采了三千二百二十一吨铬矿石。恩维尔·霍查铁工厂的工人八个月来不但完成了原订的计划，而且为国家多生产了价值一百八十三万列克（阿币名）的产品。斯大林纺织联合厂的职工不仅完成了今年1至8月的增产指标，并且还多生产了三十一万四千五百米的纺织品，比去年同期多生产了七十六万一千米。
    斯库台和发罗那两个工业城市八个月来共增产了一亿二千五百多万列克的产品。斯库台砖瓦厂增产了一百七十三万块砖瓦，超过了原先保证的二十二万多块。
    在今年头八个月的生产中，阿尔巴尼亚工人们不仅积极响应了阿尔巴尼亚劳动党提出的完成计划、提高质量的号召，并且作到了既增产又节约。如库尔布奈什铜矿工人八个月来除增产五百吨以上的铜矿石外，并为国家节约了八万多列克。斯大林和巴托斯两个石油城的青年工人们展开了收集零星原油的活动。他们到目前为止已收集了一千六百吨原油。科尔察山区的伐木工人在合理使用木材的原则下，利用零星木材生产了三千多公担木炭，加工了共二千多米长的木料，为国家增加了三百九十六万列克的财富。今年头八个月中，广大职工积极提出了合理化建议。单是斯库台一个区的统计，八个月来工人们就提出了六百四十四项合理化建议，其中已有四百三十四条被采用，这些建议可以为国家创造三百五十万列克的财富。这个区的地方国营杂品工业公司的工人更提出了“自己向前进，伸手给别人，大家齐跟上”的口号，广泛地和别人交流先进经验。（附图片）
