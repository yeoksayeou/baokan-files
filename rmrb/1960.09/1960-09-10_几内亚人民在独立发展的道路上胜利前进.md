    The People of Guinea Advance Victoriously on the Road of Independent Development

    On October 2, 1958, a new independent country was born in Black Africa—the Republic of Guinea.
    The Republic of Guinea is located on the Atlantic coast of West Africa. It is adjacent to the Mali Federation to the east and north, Portuguese Guinea to the northwest, the Ivory Coast and Liberia to the southeast, and the British colony of Sierra Leone to the south. The country has an area of ​​approximately 240,000 square kilometers and a population of more than 2.5 million.
    Guinea is one of the richest regions in West Africa. Rivers run across the country. The three main rivers in West Africa—the Senegal, Niger, and Gambia—all originate in the hilly areas here. The Konkouré River, which flows into the Atlantic Ocean, has rapid currents. It is estimated that the country's annual exploitable hydropower potential reaches 12 billion kilowatt-hours. The coastal area of ​​the Gulf of Guinea has abundant rainfall, with an average annual rainfall of 3,000 millimeters, which is suitable for crop growth. The main agricultural product is bananas, as well as coffee, coconuts, pineapples, peanuts, cotton, rubber, and so on. Mineral resources are particularly abundant. According to preliminary statistics, iron ore reserves reach 2.5 billion tons, with an annual output of about 1.1 million tons. Bauxite reserves are estimated at 600 million tons, with an annual output of about 800,000 tons. There are also diamond, gold, manganese and other mineral deposits. The annual output of diamonds is 260,000 carats. Stretching westward from the coast of Guinea, in a vast area of ​​200 to 300 kilometers wide, grows a dense tropical forest. Here, mahogany, ebony, rosewood, copal, rubber, palm and other woods are abundant, which is another valuable asset growing on Guinean soil.
    However, since the iron heels of colonialism stepped into Guinea's territory, Guinea's self-sufficient natural economy has been destroyed, and the colonialists' wanton plunder and oppression have brought profound disasters to the Guinean people. From the 15th century onwards, colonial countries such as Portugal, the Netherlands, Britain, and France established strongholds along the coast of Guinea and began the heinous activity of selling slaves. Hundreds of thousands of Guineans, like prisoners, were shackled and sent to the Americas to "develop" the resources there, causing a large number of Guinean deaths.
    In 1895, French colonialists occupied the entire territory of Guinea, and the Guinean people suffered a new catastrophe. French colonialists used coercive methods such as levying high taxes to force the Guinean people to reduce grain production and switch to growing a single crop—bananas—to supply the consumption needs of the suzerain state, and created a serious dependence of the Guinean economy on the suzerain state. Therefore, Guinea, which relies on agriculture, produces only about 250,000 tons of rice annually and has to rely on imports from other places. French colonialists also monopolized Guinea's foreign trade and domestic commerce, and used high-priced sales and low-priced purchases to carry out heavy profit exploitation of the Guinean people. Under unequal exchange conditions, Guinea had to exchange 130 tons of raw materials for 10 tons of finished products from colonial countries. Agents of French colonial companies purchased rice from farmers at low prices during the rice harvest season, and then sold it back to farmers at three times the price during the rainy season or when crops were not yet ripe, making several times the profit in one turn. Not only that, French colonialists also forcibly seized Guinean land. The most fertile land in Lower Guinea was all given by the French authorities to affiliated enterprises of the "Banque de l'Indochine" and rubber planters who moved from Indochina to West Africa. Since the discovery of important mineral deposits in Guinea, monopoly companies from France, the United States, Britain, and Canada have flocked to Guinea, carrying out large-scale plunder in the name of "development." Under the bone-sucking exploitation and oppression of colonialists, Guinea's per capita annual income was less than one fifty-seventh of that of European workers, the illiteracy rate reached 95%, and there was only one doctor for every 38,000 people.
    The enslavement rule of the colonialists could not but arouse increasingly strong resistance and struggle from the Guinean people. Guinean national hero Almamy Samori Touré led his army to repel the French expeditionary forces several times in the late 19th century and forced France to sign a peace treaty. Samori's heroic deeds of persistently engaging in armed struggle for a long time are still widely circulated in West Africa and have become a brilliant example for the Guinean people in their anti-imperialist struggle. After World War II, with the formation and growth of the Guinean working class, the national independence movement in Guinea experienced new development. Under the unified leadership of the General Confederation of Black African Workers, the Guinean working class continuously launched magnificent strike movements, demanding improved economic treatment and the realization of national independence. On September 28, 1958, the Guinean people finally rejected de Gaulle's "new constitution" in a "referendum," abandoned the "French Community," and chose to embark on the broad road of independent development.
    After Guinea embarked on the road of independent development, the Guinean people still faced the arduous task of opposing imperialism and colonialism. Imperialists and colonialists, unwilling to admit defeat, plotted various conspiracies in an attempt to strangle this newly born republic. However, the conspiracies planned by the imperialists and colonialists were met with a strong counterattack from the Guinean people.
    From December of last year to May of this year, imperialism plotted two nationwide subversion conspiracies in Guinea. However, the highly vigilant Guinean government and people uncovered these subversion cases and also found weapons and ammunition supplied by imperialist countries such as the United States, France, and West Germany. These facts fully exposed the deep-seated hatred of imperialism towards the Guinean people who insisted on independence.
    After Guinea declared its independence, French colonialists also used various despicable means in an attempt to economically strangle Guinea. As soon as Guinea declared its independence, French colonialists immediately transferred 4,000 tons of grain already en route to Conakry to the Ivory Coast. The French government ordered all French technicians in Guinea to leave immediately within two months. The day after the "referendum" was held, all French personnel working on the Conakry-Niger railway line left their posts in an attempt to paralyze Guinea's only railway. French colonialists also carried out blatant looting during their withdrawal. An article in the British "Manchester Guardian" on January 8th of last year described this robber behavior of French colonialism at the time. It wrote: "When the French left (Guinea), the treasury was empty and the annual subsidy of six million pounds to Guinea was revoked..., they (the French)...took away the office furniture, bathroom equipment, window glass and police uniforms..., about one-third of the currency in circulation was shipped back to France, and local banks stopped all loans." It is quite clear that the colonialists hoped that through various economic pressures, Guinea would be forced to abandon the path of independence and re-accept French colonial rule.
    However, the colonialists' hopes were dashed. The heroic Guinean people were not intimidated by difficulties. In less than a year after independence, they built 8,060 kilometers of roads, 335 classrooms, 672 bridges, established 67 collective plantations and 244 production cooperatives, and opened 227 stores and 228 clinics with their own hands.
    In the nearly two years since declaring independence, the Guinean government has taken a series of measures to break away from imperialist control and develop the national economy. Colonial officers were first removed from their posts in the army to maintain the purity of the army. In January of last year, the Guinean government established the Foreign Trade Bureau, stipulating that six commodities, including rice, sugar, flour, beer, matches, and cement, should be imported by the state monopoly, and the import of other commodities must also be approved by the Foreign Trade Bureau. In terms of domestic trade, in the past, 90% of the commerce was controlled by French colonial companies, but now it is gradually taken over by state-owned commerce, model stores (privately operated and supervised by the government), and rural cooperatives, with the government uniformly setting buying and selling prices. On March 1st of this year, the Guinean government announced its withdrawal from the franc zone, established a national bank, and issued its own currency to replace the French African franc. This measure is obviously of great significance for further developing Guinea's national economy and consolidating and developing Guinea's national independence.
    In order to heal the wounds left by colonialism and gradually get rid of Guinea's economic and cultural poverty and backwardness, the Guinean government began to implement a three-year plan for developing the national economy on July 1st of this year. According to President Sékou Touré, the basic goal of the three-year plan is to improve living standards, decolonize the economy, and begin to transform Guinea into a fully developed modern country. This three-year plan focuses on the development of agriculture, while also appropriately developing industry, culture, education, and public buildings. The targets to be achieved in the three-year plan are: to increase agricultural production by an average of one-fold, and to achieve self-sufficiency in rice production; to establish more than 30 medium and small-sized factories and mines throughout the country; to develop railway and highway undertakings, and to build the port of Conakry, airports, and hotels; to accelerate the development and popularization of primary education, pay attention to the development of industrial and agricultural technical education, and establish a craft school and a university; and it also requires eliminating 80% of adult illiteracy within three years. All these specific measures show that the Guinean people, who have already stood up, are making unremitting efforts under the leadership of President Sékou Touré to develop their country's economic and cultural undertakings.
    In foreign relations, the Guinean government and people adhere to a foreign policy of peace

    几内亚人民在独立发展的道路上胜利前进
    柯月霖
    1958年10月2日，在黑非洲诞生了一个新的独立国家——几内亚共和国。
    几内亚共和国位于西非洲的大西洋滨，东面和北面与马里联邦相邻，西北部与葡属几内亚接壤，东南邻接象牙海岸和利比里亚，南面为英属殖民地塞拉勒窝内。全国面积约二十四万余平方公里，人口达二百五十多万。
    几内亚是西非洲最富饶的地区之一。国内河流纵横，西非的三条主要河流——塞内加尔河、尼日尔河和冈比亚河都发源于这里的山陵地带，流向大西洋的孔库雷河，水流湍急。估计全国每年可利用的水力发电潜力达一百二十亿度。几内亚湾沿海地带雨量充沛，平均年雨量为三千毫米，适宜农作物的生长。主要农产品是香蕉，此外还有咖啡、椰子、菠萝、花生、棉花、橡胶等。矿产资源尤其丰富，据初步统计，铁矿蕴藏量达二十五亿吨，年产量约一百十万吨。铁矾土的蕴藏量估计有六亿吨，年产约八十万吨。此外还有金刚石、黄金、锰等矿藏，金刚石的年产量为二十六万克拉。从几内亚海岸迤逦往西，在宽达二三百公里的广阔地区内，生长着枝叶茂密的热带森林，这里盛产红木、黑檀木、花梨树、柯巴树、橡胶、棕榈等木材，是生长在几内亚土地上的又一宗珍贵财富。
    但是，自从殖民主义者的铁蹄踏入几内亚的国土，几内亚的自给自足的自然经济就遭到了破坏，殖民主义者的恣意掠夺和压榨给几内亚人民带来了深重的灾难。从十五世纪起，葡萄牙、荷兰、英国、法国等殖民国家就在几内亚沿海一带建立了据点，开始了贩卖奴隶的罪恶活动。成千上万的几内亚人如同囚犯一样，手足都带上了镣铐，被押往美洲去“开发”那里的资源，造成了几内亚人的大批死亡。
    1895年，法国殖民者占领了几内亚的全部领土，几内亚人民于是又遭到了新的浩劫。法国殖民者用征收高额捐税等强制办法，迫使几内亚人民减少粮食生产，改种单一作物——香蕉，以供应宗主国的消费需要，并造成几内亚经济对宗主国的严重依赖。因此，以农为生的几内亚，每年出产的大米仅约二十五万吨，不得不依赖外地的输入。法国殖民者还垄断了几内亚的对外贸易和国内商业，用贵卖贱买的办法对几内亚人民进行重利盘剥。在不等价交换的情况下，几内亚必须以一百三十吨原料向殖民国家换取十吨成品。法国殖民公司的代理人在稻米收获季节向农民压价收购的稻谷，在雨季或青黄不接的时候，又把它以三倍贵的价钱卖给农民，一转手之间盈利数倍。不仅如此，法国殖民者还强行圈占几内亚的土地。下几内亚最肥沃的土地全部被法国当局赠送给了“东方汇理银行”的附属企业以及从印度支那转移到西非的橡胶种植园主。自从几内亚的重要矿苗被陆续勘察出来后，法国、美国、英国和加拿大的垄断公司趋之若鹜，以“开发”为名，对几内亚进行大规模的掠夺。在殖民主义者敲骨吸髓的剥削和压榨下，几内亚每人每年的平均收入还不到欧洲人工资的五十七分之一，文盲率达到95％，平均每三万八千人才有一名医生。
    殖民主义者的奴役统治，不能不激起几内亚人民日益强烈的反抗和斗争。几内亚民族英雄阿尔玛美·萨摩利·杜尔曾经率领军队在十九世纪末叶接连几次击退法国远征军的进攻，并且迫使法国签订了和约。萨摩利长期坚持武装斗争的英雄事迹，至今仍在西非广泛流传，成为几内亚人民反帝斗争的光辉榜样。第二次世界大战以后，随着几内亚工人阶级的形成和壮大，几内亚的民族独立运动有了新的发展。在黑非洲工人总联合会的统一领导下，几内亚的工人阶级不断掀起波澜壮阔的罢工运动，要求改善经济待遇和实现民族独立。1958年9月28日，几内亚人民终于在“公民投票”中否决了戴高乐的“新宪法”，摒弃了“法兰西共同体”，选择了走向独立发展的康庄大道。
    在几内亚走上独立发展道路以后，几内亚人民仍然面临着反对帝国主义和殖民主义的艰巨任务。不甘心失败的帝国主义和殖民者，策划了各种阴谋，企图扼杀这个新生的共和国。但是帝国主义和殖民者策划的阴谋遭到了几内亚人民有力的回击。
    从去年12月到今年5月，帝国主义在几内亚策划两次全国规模的颠复阴谋。但是，保持着高度警惕性的几内亚政府和人民破获了这些颠复案件，并且还搜出了由美国、法国和西德等帝国主义国家供应的武器和弹药。这些事实充分暴露了帝国主义对坚持独立的几内亚人民的刻骨仇视。
    在几内亚宣布独立之后，法国殖民者还利用种种卑劣的手段，力图从经济上置几内亚于死命。几内亚刚刚宣布独立，法国殖民者马上把已在途中的运往科纳克里的四千吨粮食转移到象牙海岸。法国政府勒令在几内亚的所有法国技术人员在两个月内立即撤离。就在举行“公民投票”后的第二天，在科纳克里—尼日尔铁路线上工作的法国人员全部离开了工作岗位，企图使这条几内亚唯一的铁路陷于瘫痪。法国殖民者还在撤退时进行了明目张胆的洗劫。去年1月8日英国“曼彻斯特卫报”的一篇文章描绘了当时法国殖民主义者的这种强盗行为，它写道：“法国人离开（几内亚）的时候，财政部空空如也，而且撤销了每年给予几内亚的六百万英镑的补助……，他们（法国人）……把办公室的家具、浴室用具、窗户的玻璃和警察的制服都通通带走了……，约有三分之一的流通货币运回法国，当地银行停止了一切贷款”。十分明白，殖民主义者的指望是，通过经济上的种种压力，迫使几内亚舍弃独立的道路，而重新接受法国的殖民统治。
    但是，殖民主义者的指望落空了。英勇的几内亚人民没有被困难所吓倒，他们在独立后不到一年的时间内，用自己的双手修建了八千零六十公里的公路、三百三十五所教室、六百七十二座桥梁，建立了六十七个集体种植园和二百四十四个生产合作社，开设了二百二十七家商店和二百二十八个诊疗所。
    在宣告独立以后的将近两年的时间内，几内亚政府采取了一系列摆脱帝国主义控制和发展民族经济的措施。在军队中首先撤除了殖民军官的职务，保持了军队的纯洁。去年1月，几内亚政府设立了对外贸易局，规定大米、食糖、面粉、啤酒、火柴和水泥等六种商品由国家垄断进口，其他商品的进口也必须取得对外贸易局的同意。在国内贸易方面，过去90％的商业受法国殖民公司的控制，现在则由国营商业、示范商店（私人经营，受政府监督）和农村合作社逐步接管，由政府统一规定买卖价格。今年3月1日，几内亚政府宣布退出法郎区，建立了国家银行，并且发行本国货币以替代法属非洲法郎。这个措施，对于进一步发展几内亚的民族经济、巩固和发展几内亚的民族独立，显然具有重大的意义。
    为了医治殖民主义遗留下来的百孔千疮，逐步地摆脱几内亚经济上和文化上的贫穷和落后的状态，几内亚政府从今年7月1日起开始实行发展国民经济的三年计划。据塞古·杜尔总统宣布，三年计划的基本目标是改善生活水平、使经济非殖民化、开始把几内亚改变为一个充分发达的现代化国家。这个三年计划以发展农业为中心，同时也适当发展工业、文化教育和公用建筑。三年计划要求达到的指标是：农产品产量平均增加一倍，大米产量自给自足；在全国各地建立三十多个中小型厂矿；发展铁路和公路事业，修建科纳克里港口、机场、旅馆；加速发展和普及初等教育，注意发展工业和农业技术教育，建立一所工艺学校、一所大学，还要求在三年内扫除80％的壮年文盲。所有这些具体措施都表明，已经站立起来的几内亚人民，在塞古·杜尔总统的领导下，正在为发展自己祖国的经济和文化事业进行着不懈的努力。
    在对外关系上，几内亚政府和人民坚持奉行和平中立的外交政策，积极地发展同社会主义各国的友好合作关系。几内亚已经同苏联、中国、捷克斯洛伐克、保加利亚、越南民主共和国和蒙古人民共和国建立了正式的关系，并已同朝鲜民主主义人民共和国相互承认。几内亚还和德意志民主共和国、波兰、苏联、捷克斯洛伐克、匈牙利、保加利亚等社会主义国家，在平等互利的基础上签订了贸易协定。几内亚与社会主义国家友好合作关系的不断发展，不仅符合于几内亚的民族利益，而且有利于世界和平的事业。同时，几内亚政府和人民，积极地支持非洲各国人民争取和维护民族独立的斗争，并为加强非洲人民的团结，加强亚非人民的团结事业作出了积极的贡献。
    自从几内亚独立以后，中国和几内亚两国的友好关系在和平共处的五项原则基础上得到了不断的发展。中国人民坚决支持非洲人民和几内亚人民争取和维护民族独立的斗争。正如塞古·杜尔总统所指出的，“中国政府和人民是非洲各国人民和几内亚人民的真正朋友。……他们同我们肩并肩地对帝国主义和殖民主义战斗，直到获得最后胜利”。我们高兴地看到，几内亚人民在独立发展的道路上日益获得显著的成就。我们深信，中几两国人民的友谊将会在反对帝国主义的共同斗争中获得更加迅速的发展。以塞古·杜尔总统为首的几内亚政府代表团这次访问我国，必将进一步促进我们两国的友好合作关系，发展我们两国人民的在反对帝国主义和殖民主义斗争中所结成的战斗的友谊。（附图片）
