Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 28th - The "Laos Fighting Forces Radio" reported today that Prince Souphanouvong, Chairman of the Central Committee of the Lao Patriotic Front, sent a letter to the World Peace Council on September 21st, calling on peace-loving friends all over the world to rise up and oppose the interventionist conspiracy plotted by the US aggressor bloc and its running dogs in Southeast Asia against the Kingdom of Laos.

In the letter, Prince Souphanouvong pointed out that the US imperialists and the reactionary ruling cliques of Thailand and South Vietnam are hostile to the policy of peace, neutrality, and national harmony declared by the government of the Kingdom of Laos headed by Prince Souvanna Phouma. They collude with the Phoumi Nosavan clique, which openly launched a rebellion against the legitimate Souvanna Phouma government, and frantically intensify their intervention in Laos.

The letter pointed out that the United States, Thailand, and the reactionary authorities of South Vietnam supply Phoumi Nosavan with US dollars, arms, aircraft, and other war materials. In order to coordinate with their planned conspiracies, they sent secret delegations to this traitor. They also appointed many officers as advisors to Phoumi Nosavan to guide and intensify the implementation of their conspiracy to transport Phoumi Nosavan's troops through Thailand.

The letter condemned this act of openly interfering in the sovereignty of the Lao people and undermining the basic principles of international relations. The letter stated that the Lao people resolutely oppose this aggression. It said that the government of the Kingdom of Laos has also repeatedly lodged strong protests against this blatant interference.

The letter went on to say that the US aggressor bloc and the reactionaries of Thailand and South Vietnam have not only failed to change their attitude but have intensified their aggressive activities against Laos.

The letter revealed that the Thai government allows Phoumi Nosavan's troops, which include Thai personnel, to shell Lao territory from Thai bases; moreover, the Thai Foreign Minister officially announced on September 21st his decision to promote the armed intervention of the aggressive Southeast Asia Treaty Organization military bloc in Laos.

The letter pointed out: This once again clearly proves that the US aggressor bloc and its running dogs in Southeast Asia are not only assisting the Phoumi Nosavan rebel clique in their conspiracy to attack Vientiane and oppose the legitimate government of Laos and the Lao people but also completely disregard the Geneva Agreements and the independence and sovereignty of Laos, as well as the legitimate aspirations of the Lao people, and are carrying out direct armed intervention in Laos. The purpose of this conspiracy is to realize the US attempt to turn Laos into a new-type colony and a US aggression base.

The letter pointed out that the purpose of taking this action is to provoke a conflict that will affect not only Laos but also Indochina and the entire Southeast Asia.

The letter continued: "In the name of the Lao Patriotic Front (whose position has always embodied the will of our people for peace and freedom), we would like to issue an urgent appeal to the World Peace Council, hoping that the World Peace Council will loudly denounce the aggressive conspiracy of the US aggressor bloc and its running dogs in Southeast Asia against our country."

    苏发努冯亲王致函世界和平理事会
    呼吁世界和平力量反对美国干涉老挝
    指出美国阴谋使老挝成为新型殖民地和侵略基地
    新华社河内28日电　据寮国战斗部队电台今天报道，老挝爱国战线党中央委员会主席苏发努冯亲王于9月21日致函世界和平理事会，呼吁全世界爱好和平的朋友们起来反对美国侵略集团及其在东南亚的走狗对老挝王国策划的干涉阴谋。
    苏发努冯亲王在这封信中指出，美帝国主义者以及泰国和越南南方的反动统治集团敌视以梭发那·富马亲王为首的老挝王国政府所宣布的和平、中立和民族和睦政策，他们同公开发动叛乱、反对合法的梭发那·富马政府的富米·诺萨万集团狼狈为奸，疯狂地加紧干涉老挝。
    信中指出，美国、泰国和越南南方的反动当局以美元、军火、飞机和其它战争物资供给富米·诺萨万。为了配合他们所策划的阴谋，他们向这个卖国贼派去了秘密代表团。他们还指派许多军官担任富米·诺萨万的顾问，以便指导和加紧执行他们通过泰国运输富米·诺萨万的军队的阴谋。
    信中谴责了这种公开干涉老挝人民的主权和破坏国际关系基本原则的行为。信中表示，老挝人民坚决反对这种侵略。信中说，老挝王国政府也一再对这种粗暴干涉提出了强硬的抗议。
    信中接着说，但是，美国侵略集团以及泰国和越南南方的反动派不但没有改变他们的态度，反而加紧进行对老挝的侵略活动。
    信中揭露：泰国政府允许有泰国人参加的富米·诺萨万军队从泰国基地炮轰老挝的领土；而且泰国外交部长在9月21日正式宣布了他促使侵略性的东南亚条约组织军事集团对老挝进行武装干涉的决定。
    信中指出：这就再一次清楚地证明了美国侵略集团及其在东南亚的走狗不仅在帮助富米·诺萨万叛乱集团进攻万象、反对老挝合法政府和老挝人民的阴谋，而且完全无视日内瓦协议和老挝的独立和主权以及老挝人民的正当愿望，而对老挝进行了直接的武装干涉。这种阴谋的目的是为了实现美国使老挝成为一个新型的殖民地和美国的侵略基地的企图。
    信中指出，采取这种行动的目的，是为了挑起不仅将影响老挝而且将影响印度支那和整个东南亚的冲突。
    信中接着说：“以老挝爱国战线党（这个党的立场始终体现了我国人民要求和平和自由的意志）的名义，我们谨向世界和平理事会发出迫切的呼吁，希望世界和平理事会大声疾呼来反对美国侵略集团及其在东南亚的走狗对我国所进行的侵略阴谋。”
