Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, September 28th: The Tianjin steel refining red flag team – the Yang Desheng team of the Second Branch of the Tianjin No. 2 Steel Plant, victoriously crossed the "thousand heats without waste steel" mark on the 24th of this month, continuously creating a new record of one thousand and three heats without rejects, offering a gift to National Day.

　　On the morning of the 24th, as soon as the sun rose, the eleven workers of Yang Desheng's team came to the steel plant early with excited hearts. Before starting work, they made various preparations carefully and meticulously, and then held a pre-shift meeting that was longer than any previous one. This pre-shift meeting was different from usual; everyone's mood was tense and excited, because today was the decisive day to achieve "thousand heats without waste steel" and offer a gift to National Day. Communist Party member and team leader (furnace chief) Yang Desheng looked at everyone's expressions and thought: If everyone's mood cannot be calmed down during the steelmaking process, operational accidents may occur, affecting the realization of "thousand heats without waste steel." He repeatedly instructed all team members with the words that the Party branch secretary and the chairman of the trade union often said, "The more you face victory, the more you must calmly face the challenge, and the more you are about to win, the more you must guard against arrogance and impetuosity." After team discussion, everyone's mood gradually calmed down. After the meeting, they immediately calmly took over the shift and devoted themselves to the "battle" with full energy.

　　At noon, the nine hundred and ninety-ninth heat of steel had already been refined. After sampling and inspection, under the command of second assistant Han Guide, the molten steel was quickly poured into the steel ladle. In just a few minutes, the loudspeaker loudly broadcast: The Yang Desheng team has achieved nine hundred and ninety-nine heats without waste steel! The exciting news encouraged the enthusiasm of all the workers in the factory, and also attracted many people who cared about the Yang Desheng team achieving zero rejects in a thousand heats, who came to the steelmaking furnace of the Yang Desheng team, including responsible comrades from the Tianjin Municipal Party Committee, Young Pioneers wearing red scarves, as well as writers, photographers, and others.

　　The first heat of the thousandth steel started, although there were so many people watching the performance, the workers of the Yang Desheng team were still calm and unhurried. They quickly and nimbly poured a full bag of molten iron into the converter. After a period of blowing, the steel bar was quickly taken out. At this time, Yang Desheng, as usual, personally swung the sledgehammer to do the sample test; after the test, Yang Desheng decided to blow for a few more minutes, and the team workers carefully carried out the team leader's opinion. Before long, Yang Desheng suddenly picked up a small iron bar and rang the bell to order steel release with a clanging sound. The bell resounded throughout the huge steel workshop, telling people: The steelmaking heroes of the Yang Desheng team have refined another heat of high-quality steel! On this day, the team refined a total of fifteen heats of steel, victoriously achieved the guarantee of "thousand heats without rejects," and created the highest record for large converter shift production in the factory.

　　Having victoriously crossed the thousand heats without waste steel mark, the Yang Desheng team is not satisfied with the existing achievements. Now, they are full of confidence and are continuing to bravely advance towards the great goal of no rejects throughout the year.

　　杨德生连炼千炉无废钢
    新华社天津28日电  天津市炼钢红旗小组——天津市第二钢厂二分厂杨德生小组，在本月24日胜利地跨过了“千炉无废钢”大关，连续创造了一千零三炉无废品的最新纪录，向国庆节献礼。
    24日清晨，当太阳刚露头的时候，杨德生小组的十一名工人怀着激动的心情提前来到了钢厂。上班以前，他们紧张而又细致地做好了各项准备工作，接着召开了比任何一次时间都长的班前会。这次班前会与往日不同，每个人的心情都紧张而激动，因为今天是实现“千炉无废钢”、向国庆节献礼的决定性的一天。共产党员、小组长（炉长）杨德生看了看大家的表情，心里想：如果在炼钢过程中大家的心情不能平静下来，可能要发生操作方面的事故，影响“千炉无废钢”的实现。他就把党支部书记和工会主席经常讲的“越在胜利面前越要沉着应战，越在决定胜利的时候越要戒躁戒骄”等话，反复地叮嘱全组工人。经过小组讨论，大家的心情逐渐平静下来，会后，他们立即沉着地接过班来，人人干劲十足地投入了“战斗”。
    中午时分已经炼到第九百九十九炉钢了。经过取样检验合格以后，在二助手韩贵得的指挥下，钢水迅速地倒入钢包。不几分钟，扩音器里高声地广播着：杨德生小组已经实现九百九十九炉无废钢！振奋人心的消息鼓舞了全厂职工的干劲，还吸引了许多关心杨德生小组实现千炉不出废品的人们，来到杨德生小组的炼钢炉前，其中有中共天津市委的负责人，戴红领巾的少先队员，以及作家、摄影师等。
    开始炼第一千炉钢了，尽管来看表演的人是那样多，杨德生小组的工人们依然是从容不迫。他们把一包满满的铁水，迅速而灵敏地兑进转炉。经过一段时间的吹炼，钢钎很快取了出来。这时，杨德生同往常一样，亲自抡起大锤作砸样试验；试验后，杨德生决定再吹炼几分钟，小组工人认真地执行着组长的意见。不一会，杨德生猛地拿起小铁棒，嘡嘡地敲响了命令出钢的钟声。这钟声响彻了巨大的钢铁车间，它告诉人们：杨德生小组的炼钢英雄们又把一炉优质钢炼出来了！这一天，这个小组共炼出十五炉钢，胜利地实现了“千炉无废品”的保证，并且创造了这个厂大型转炉班产量的最高纪录。
    胜利地跨过千炉无废钢大关的杨德生小组，并不满足于已有的成绩。现在，他们又满怀信心地在向着全年无废品的伟大目标，继续勇敢前进。
