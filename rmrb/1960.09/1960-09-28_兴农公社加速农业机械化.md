Xingnong Commune Accelerates Agricultural Mechanization
    Increased by 188 standard tractors and 330 tractor-drawn farm implements in the past year; the commune has 60,000 drivers and farm implement operators. Last year, each laborer produced an average of more than 20,000 jin of grain, with a commodity rate of 67 percent.

    Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, September 27th: The establishment of the People's Commune has created conditions for accelerating the realization of agricultural mechanization. The Xingnong People's Commune in Baiquan County, Heilongjiang Province, with the help of the state, has taken another big step on the road to agricultural mechanization in the past year. Now the number of tractors in the commune has increased from 118 standard units last year to 306 standard units, and the number of tractor-drawn farm implements has increased from 187 units (pieces) last year to 517 units (pieces). These agricultural machines have shown great power in production.

    Communization coupled with mechanization has enabled the production of the Xingnong People's Commune to develop by leaps and bounds, and the labor productivity of commune members has been greatly improved. Last year, each agricultural laborer in the commune produced more than 22,000 jin of grain, an increase of 58.6% compared with the Great Leap Forward year of 1958, and the commodity rate of grain reached 67.3%; that is to say, each agricultural laborer can contribute more than 15,000 jin of grain to support the state in a year. The spring wheat here has just been harvested; the dense soybeans, sorghum, corn, millet, and other major autumn crops are maturing and drying. In the threshing ground, tractors drive threshers to thresh wheat day and night; on the highways, "Liberation" brand trucks and tractors pulling trailers are running back and forth, transporting wheat into warehouses; in the vast fields, "Dongfanghong" tractors pull five-share plows, making rumbling noises, deep plowing wheat fields, and preparing for next year's sowing.

    The agricultural mechanization of the Xingnong People's Commune started in 1957. At that time, there was only one advanced agricultural production cooperative, that is, one management area in the current commune, with two mixed sets of tractors. The establishment of the People's Commune in 1958 promoted the development of agricultural mechanization. First of all, in terms of funds, due to the comprehensive and great development of the commune's production, income has greatly increased, public accumulation has increased, and it can be used centrally, which makes them have sufficient funds to purchase tractors and various towed farm implements. Since the autumn harvest last year, the commune has taken out more than 1.99 million yuan from the public accumulation to develop agricultural mechanization. At the same time, the vast number of commune members who strongly demanded the realization of agricultural mechanization also actively raised funds for the realization of mechanization. Zhao Wenfu, a 105-year-old grandfather in the Heping Management Area, worked as a long-term hired laborer for landlords for more than 70 years in the old society. When he heard about mechanization, he was very happy and took the lead in depositing 140 yuan.

    In terms of talent cultivation, the Xingnong People's Commune has adopted methods such as sending people out to study, running its own training classes, and using masters to bring apprentices, and has trained more than 60,000 drivers and farm implement operators. The "bosses" who used to drive horse carts and the daughters of poor peasants have now become experts in driving "iron oxen." The commune has also expanded the tractor repair and assembly plant, established repair points in various management areas, and organized mobile repair teams to ensure that minor repairs can be done within the area and general major repairs can be done within the commune, ensuring the improvement of the vehicle dispatch rate.

    In order to make agricultural machinery suitable for local farming conditions and farming systems, and meet the requirements of intensive cultivation, the commune has also reformed towed farm implements. In the past year, it has reformed more than 200 pieces of towed farm implements such as flat sowing and ridge-raising machines, and mid-tillage suspended five-share plows, which has improved the utilization rate of vehicles. Now they are studying the reform of autumn harvest tools such as high-stalk crop harvesters and threshing machines.

    The large increase in agricultural machinery has enabled the commune, which has a frost-free period of only 120 days a year and each agricultural laborer bears more than 70 mu of cultivated land, to gain the initiative in racing against time with nature. When planting wheat this spring, they dispatched more than 70 tractors and spent only five days to plant more than 120,000 mu of wheat; when planting large fields, it took only 27 days to plant 480,000 mu of large field crops, shortening the sowing period by about half a month compared with last year, and achieving timely sowing. During the summer hoeing, although they encountered continuous overcast rain and the difficulty of weeds growing at the same time, due to the commune's people, machines, and horses working together, they still ensured that all the major autumn crops were hoed four times and eliminated weeds.

    Due to the continuous improvement of the degree of agricultural mechanization, the Xingnong Commune has freed up a large amount of manpower and animal power to carry out reclamation and further implement the "Eight-Character Constitution" for agriculture on a large area of cultivated land, improving the level of intensive cultivation. This spring, the commune adopted a combination of machines, horses, and cattle to carry out a land reclamation campaign, and the area of cultivated land increased by more than 11,000 mu. The original cultivated land, after deep plowing, accounted for 80% of the area that should be plowed; the amount of fertilizer applied per mu reached more than 5,000 jin, an increase of 25% compared with last year; all cultivated land was rationally and densely planted.

    The rapid progress of agricultural mechanization has enabled the commune to better implement the policy of taking grain as the key link and developing in an all-round way in production. The commune has used a part of the manpower freed up by mechanization to comprehensively develop various economic sectors according to the principle of farming during busy seasons and working during slack seasons. Now the commune has expanded the iron and wood joint processing plant and fertilizer plant, which serve agriculture. Animal husbandry has also been greatly developed. The number of pigs has increased from more than 21,000 last year to more than 53,000, an average of 1.1 pigs per person; the number of poultry has increased from more than 77,000 last year to more than 246,000, an average of more than 5 per person.

    充分发挥人民公社的优越性
    兴农公社加速农业机械化
    一年来，增加一百八十八标准台拖拉机，三百三十台机引农具；全社拥有六万名驾驶员和农具手。去年每个劳动力平均生产 粮食二万多斤，商品率达百分之六十七
    据新华社哈尔滨27日电　人民公社的成立，为加速实现农业机械化创造了条件。黑龙江拜泉县兴农人民公社，在国家帮助下，一年来在农业机械化的道路上又跨进了一大步。现在全社拖拉机已由去年的一百一十八标准台增长到三百零六标准台，机引农具由去年的一百八十七台（件）增长到五百一十七台（件）。这些农业机械在生产中显示了巨大的威力。
    公社化加上机械化，使兴农人民公社的生产得到突飞猛进的发展，社员劳动生产率大大提高。去年这个社每个农业劳动力生产粮食两万二千多斤，比大跃进的1958年增长58.6％，粮食的商品率达到67.3％；也就是说，每个农业劳动力，一年可以拿出一万五千来斤粮食支援国家。现在这里的春小麦刚收割不久；长得密茂的大豆、高粱、包米、谷子等大秋作物，正在度籽晒粒。在场院里，拖拉机带动脱谷机，日夜不停的进行小麦脱谷；在公路上，“解放牌”汽车和牵引着拖车的拖拉机，往来奔跑，运送小麦入仓；在广阔的田野里，“东方红”拖拉机牵引着五铧犁，发出滚雷般的响声，深翻麦田，为明年播种进行准备。
    兴农人民公社的农业机械化是从1957年开始的。当时只有一个高级农业生产合作社，即现在公社里的一个管理区，有两混合台拖拉机。1958年人民公社的建立，促进了农业机械化的发展。首先在资金上，由于公社生产的全面大发展，收入大大增加，公共积累增多，而且又能集中使用，这就使他们有足够的资金购买拖拉机和各种拖带农具。从去年秋收以来，公社就从公共积累中，拿出了一百九十九万多元钱，用来发展农业机械化。同时，对实现农业机械化有强烈要求的广大社员，也积极为实现机械化筹集资金。和平管理区一百零五岁的赵文福老爷爷，在旧社会给地主扛了七十多年大活，在他听说搞机械化的时候，高兴极啦，带头存款一百四十元。
    在人材培养方面，兴农人民公社采取了派出去学，自己开训练班，以师带徒等办法，培养了六万多名驾驶员和农具手，昔日赶大车的“老板子”，贫农的女儿，现在都成了驾驶“铁牛”的能手。公社还扩建了拖拉机修配厂，在各管理区设立了修配点，组织了流动修理小组，做到了小修不出区、一般大修不出社，保证了机车出动率的提高。
    为了使农业机械适合当地耕作条件和耕作制度，符合精耕细作的要求，这个公社还对拖带农具进行了改革。一年来共改革了平播起垅机、中耕悬吊五铧犁等拖带农具二百来件，提高了机车的利用率。现在他们正在研究改革高秆作物收割机、扬场机等秋收工具。
    农业机具的大量增加，就使这个一年的无霜期只有一百二十几天，每个农业劳动力负担耕地七十多亩的公社，在和自然抢时间上争得了主动。今年春天种小麦时，他们出动了七十多台拖拉机，只用五天的工夫，就把十二万多亩小麦种完；在种大田的时候，只用了二十七天的工夫，就把四十八万亩大田作物种完，播种期比去年缩短了半个月左右，做到了适时播种。夏锄时，虽然遇到连阴雨和草苗齐长的困难，但是由于公社人、机、马一齐出动，仍然保证了全部大秋作物做到四铲四趟，消灭杂草。
    兴农公社由于农业机械化的程度不断提高，腾出了大批人力畜力进行开荒和在大面积的耕地上进一步贯彻农业“八字宪法”，提高了精耕细作的水平。今春，公社由于采取了机、马、牛相结合的方法，开展了开荒运动，耕地面积增加了一万一千多亩。原有耕地，经过深翻的占应翻面积的80％；每亩施肥量达五千多斤，比去年增加25％；全部耕地都进行了合理密植。
    农业机械化的阔步进展，使公社在生产上更好的贯彻了以粮为纲全面发展的方针。公社凭借机械化腾出的一部分人力，根据农忙务农，农闲作工的原则，全面地发展了多种经济。现在公社已经扩建了为农业服务的铁木联合加工厂、化肥厂等社办工厂。畜牧业也得到很大发展，生猪由去年的二万一千多头，发展到五万三千多头，平均每人达到一点一头；家禽由去年的七万七千多只，发展到二十四万六千多只，平均每人达到五只多。
