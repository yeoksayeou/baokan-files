Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, September 3rd: According to Pyongyang newspapers today, a vinylon chemical fiber factory with an annual output of 20,000 tons of chemical fiber is under construction in the Xingnam area of ​​northern Korea. This factory is designed, equipped, and constructed by the Korean people themselves.

In order to promote this construction project, an activist congress of relevant departments was held in Xingnam on September 1. Kim Il-sung, Prime Minister of the Korean Cabinet, called on the builders at the meeting to complete the first phase of the factory by the "May Day" International Labor Day next year and to complete the entire project by the end of next year.

In his speech, Kim Il-sung emphasized the significance of developing chemical fibers in northern Korea. He pointed out that the actual cultivated land area in northern Korea is only 1.8 million chongbo, and the climate is not suitable for cotton planting. It is difficult to fully solve the problem of clothing by relying solely on the production of natural fibers. Therefore, vigorously developing the production of chemical fibers can completely solve the people's clothing problem. He said that the 20,000 tons of vinylon chemical fiber produced by the newly built factory each year is equivalent to the natural fiber produced on 200,000 chongbo of land.

Kim Il-sung said that the US imperialists carried out cruel destruction of Korean cities, villages, factories, and enterprises during the war of aggression against Korea. They thought that the Korean people would never be able to stand up again. However, reality is completely contrary to the enemy's wishes. We have carried out a lot of restoration and construction, and laid a more solid economic foundation than before the war, and productivity has increased several times. Today we can effectively build vinylon chemical fiber factories ourselves. In the past, Korea was a backward colony, and Koreans themselves could not do anything. Today, under the leadership of the Workers' Party, the Korean people are managing their country well, and they are building and operating many modern factories themselves. Kim Il-sung called on the workers to continue to break down mysterious ideas, promote the spirit of daring to think and act, and establish a firm belief that they can manufacture everything with their own strength. He also called on builders and scientific workers to combine their efforts to shorten the construction time and ensure the quality of construction.

    金日成在建设化学纤维工厂积极分子大会上
    号召职工发扬敢想敢干精神
    他说：美帝国主义在侵朝战争中对朝鲜进行了残酷的破坏，他们以为朝鲜人民再也站不起来了。但是，现实同敌人的愿望完全相反，今天朝鲜人民在劳动党的领导下，很好地管理着自己的国家，并且建设和经营许多现代化的工厂
    新华社平壤3日电据平壤报纸今天报道，在朝鲜北部兴南地区正在建设一座年产二万吨化学纤维的维尼龙化学纤维工厂。这座工厂是由朝鲜人民自己设计、自己制造设备和自己施工的。
    为了促进这一建设工程，9月1日在兴南举行了有关部门的积极分子大会，朝鲜内阁首相金日成在会上号召建设者们在明年“五一”国际劳动节完成这座工厂的第一阶段工程，到明年年底全部竣工。
    金日成在讲话时强调在朝鲜北部发展化学纤维的意义。他指出，朝鲜北部的实际耕地面积只有一百八十万町步，而且气候条件不宜植棉，仅靠生产自然纤维很难充分解决穿衣问题。因此，大力发展化学纤维的生产，就可完全解决人民的穿衣问题。他说，新建的这座工厂每年生产的二万吨维尼龙化学纤维，就等于在二十万町步的土地上生产的自然纤维。
    金日成说，美帝国主义在侵朝战争中对朝鲜的城市、乡村、工厂企业进行了残酷的破坏，他们以为朝鲜人民再也站不起来了。但是，现实同敌人的愿望完全相反。我们进行了很多的恢复和建设，打下了比战前更加巩固的经济基础，生产力增长了几倍。今天我们自己能够有成效地建设维尼龙化学纤维工厂了。过去朝鲜是落后的殖民地，朝鲜人自己什么事情都不会干。今天朝鲜人民在劳动党的领导下，很好地管理着自己的国家，并且自己建设和经营许多现代化的工厂。金日成号召职工们继续打破神秘观念，发扬敢想敢干的精神，树立用自己的力量什么都能制造的牢固的信心。他还号召建设者和科学工作者相结合，缩短建设时间，保证建设质量。
