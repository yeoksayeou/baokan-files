From chance, see inevitability

    The Meng Hu No. 2 Team of the Xucun People's Commune in Haining, Zhejiang, found the "secret" to reducing the percentage of empty grains in late rice. They began planting continuous cropping of late rice in 1956; having no previous experience with continuous cropping of late rice, they used the methods of managing single-season late rice to manage the continuous cropping of late rice. As a result, the percentage of empty grains in most of the continuous cropping late rice was as high as 25%. However, the percentage of empty grains in more than two mu of late rice was only 8%. It seemed like an accidental phenomenon. But they did not let it go, but painstakingly pursued "why". Compared with the fields with a high percentage of empty grains, they found that the difference between these two mu of fields was that the base fertilizer was sufficient and the tillering was fast; other fields did not apply base fertilizer, but applied top dressing fertilizer vigorously, delaying heading. The following year, when planting continuous cropping of late rice again, they only applied base fertilizer and did not apply top dressing fertilizer, and the percentage of empty grains was reduced; however, compared with the more than three mu of experimental fields, each mu still yielded eighty jin less. "Why?" It turned out that these three mu of fields were top-dressed with tillering fertilizer and ear-promoting fertilizer in a timely manner. In this way, their understanding became deeper and more comprehensive.
    On August 30, our newspaper introduced the matter of Meng Hu No. 2 Team. Now, we introduce another matter. The single-season late rice and continuous cropping late rice of the Shiqiao No. 14 Team of the Tongyuan People's Commune in Haining County have already achieved no lodging last year, and this year they want to continue to achieve no lodging. They began to plant late rice on a large area in 1955. In the first year, some lodged. The lodging occurred in two plots of fields. "Why?" They carefully pursued the reasons. They found that these two plots of land were low-lying and the water never stopped from planting to harvesting; the other plot of land was higher, the drainage was smooth, and the rice did not lodge at all. Different situations were also found in terms of fertilization. Everyone raised a series of questions, tracing the root and pursuing the bottom line, and determined that whether lodging occurs mainly depends on whether the water and fertilizer are used reasonably. The following year, a party member, together with two other commune members, consciously carried out experiments to prevent lodging, and adopted different water management methods for fields with different terrain heights. In the third year, more people participated in the research. Their experience in preventing lodging became richer and richer, and finally they achieved no lodging of all late rice in the entire team, with an average yield of more than 760 jin per mu.
    "Wherever chance appears to play a role on the surface, this chance itself is always subject to internal, hidden laws. The whole problem lies in discovering these laws." (Engels: "Ludwig Feuerbach and the End of Classical German Philosophy") Necessity is always manifested through many accidental phenomena. Why does late rice have more empty grains in this field and fewer empty grains in another field? Why is there more lodging in this field and no lodging in another field? These seem to be some accidental phenomena. However, behind these accidental phenomena, there is a necessity at work. If people want to break the domination of chance and gain the initiative in conquering nature, they must constantly practice and constantly use their minds to find the inevitable laws from accidental phenomena.
    Objective laws cannot be changed by people; however, people can grasp them and use them. Why did the members of the Meng Hu No. 2 Team and the Shiqiao No. 14 Team discover the "secret" to reducing empty grains in late rice and preventing lodging in late rice? This is where people's subjective efforts play a role. If this is also seen as determined by objective necessity, it will fall into fatalism and give up subjective efforts. If the people of these two teams do not discover it, other people will always discover it. Whoever is willing to practice and use their minds can discover it earlier and master it earlier. If everyone practices and uses their minds, they can discover it earlier and master it earlier.

    从偶然看必然	易之
    浙江海宁许村公社孟湖二小队，找到了降低晚稻秕谷率的“秘密”。他们从1956年开始种植连作晚稻；过去没有种连作晚稻的实践，就用管理单季晚稻的办法来管理连作晚稻。结果，大部分连作晚稻的秕谷率高达25％。可是，有二亩多晚稻的秕谷率只有8％。看来，这好像是一个偶然的现象。但他们没有把它放过，而是用心地追究“为什么”。同秕谷率高的田一比，发现这二亩多田的不同之点是底肥足，发棵快；别的田是不施底肥，猛施追肥，抽穗延迟。第二年，再种连作晚稻，他们只施基肥，不施追肥，结果秕谷率是降低了；可是同三亩多试验田比，每亩还少收八十斤。“为什么？”原来是这三亩多田适时地追施了发棵肥和长穗肥。这样，他们的认识就更深刻、更全面了。
    8月30日，我们报上介绍了孟湖二小队的这件事。现在，我们介绍另一件事。海宁县通元公社石桥十四小队的单季晚稻和连作晚稻，去年已经做到全不倒伏，今年要做到继续不倒伏。他们是1955年开始大面积种晚稻的。头一年，有一些倒伏了。倒伏的却在两片田里。“为什么？”他们细心追究原因。他们发现这两片田地势低，从种到收没有断过水；另一片田地势较高，排水畅快，水稻完全没有倒伏。在施肥方面，也发现了不同的情况。大家提出一连串问题，寻根究底，认定倒不倒主要在于用水、施肥是否合理。第二年，一个党员同另外两个社员一起，有意识地进行防倒伏的试验，对地势高低不同的田采用不同的管水方法。第三年，更多的人参加研究。他们防倒伏的经验越来越丰富了，终于做到了全队全部晚稻不倒伏，平均亩产七百六十多斤。
    “凡表面上看去是偶然性在起作用的地方，其实这种偶然性本身始终是服从于内部的隐藏着的规律的。全部问题就在于发现这些规律。”（恩格斯：《费尔巴哈与德国古典哲学的终结》）必然性总是通过许许多多的偶然现象表现出来。晚稻为什么在这一块田里秕谷多，在另一块田里秕谷少？为什么在这一片田里倒伏多，在另一片田里不倒伏？看起来是一些偶然现象。可是，在这些偶然性的背后，却是有必然性在起作用的。人们要打破偶然性的支配，要在征服自然中取得主动权，就要不断地实践、不断地用心，从偶然的现象中找出必然的规律来。
    客观规律不是人们所能改变的；可是，人们可以掌握它，运用它。为什么孟湖二小队、石桥十四小队的社员们发现了减少晚稻秕谷和防止晚稻倒伏的“秘密”？这就是人的主观努力在起作用。如果把这也看成是客观的必然性决定着的，那就会陷入宿命论，放弃主观的努力。如果这两个小队的人们不发现，总会有别的人们来发现。谁肯实践、肯用心，谁就能早发现，早掌握。大家都来实践、都来用心，就能发现得更早，掌握得更早。
