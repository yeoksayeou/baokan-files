    Wang Dawan Settles Down in County Farm Implement Factory
	Writing Group of the Wuhan Municipal Committee of the Communist Youth League
    In March of this year, the Wuhan Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party issued a call for cities to support the countryside and industry to support agriculture. Wang Dawan, a worker at the Wuhan Automobile Factory, immediately signed up with the Party branch. He said to Xia Fangmin, the Party branch secretary: "I was born in the countryside and herded cattle there. Now that we are vigorously developing agriculture, grain production, and agricultural technical transformation, we need technical workers. I am willing to work with the peasant brothers to accelerate the construction of a new socialist countryside."

    Wang Dawan was approved and happily went home to tell his father. His father was stunned when he heard this: "Why would you leave your job at the automobile factory to go to a small factory in the county?" That evening, he and his younger brother tried to persuade their father. He said to his father: "The countryside has undergone great changes since liberation, but compared with the requirements of our national construction, production is still backward. To change the face of the countryside more quickly, we need to send machines and technical workers to support the countryside. This is a major and glorious task. ..." The brothers patiently persuaded their father. On the day he left, the old man happily saw Wang Dawan off and repeatedly told him to work hard.

    As soon as Wang Dawan arrived in Yunmeng County, he was deeply attracted by the leaping forward scene. Especially when visiting the Jindian People's Commune, seeing farmers supplying large quantities of vegetables and pigs to the city, he thought: "Peasant brothers actively support industrial construction, and we workers should wholeheartedly support agriculture and accelerate the transformation of the rural technical landscape. Having come to Yunmeng, I must devote all my strength to building Yunmeng well."

    Wang Dawan was assigned to the fitter workshop of the county farm implement factory as deputy director. At first, he was a little unaccustomed to it. Seeing that there was not much equipment in the factory and most of it was belt-driven lathes, the thought flashed in his mind: "With this kind of equipment, it will be difficult to complete the task!" However, he thought to himself, "Wang Dawan! What are you thinking? The conditions in large and small factories are different, how can you only compare the good things?" He recalled that when he first entered the Wuhan Automobile Factory, most of the factory was also belt-driven lathes, and the number of people was not large. Compared with the county farm implement factory, it was not much better! Yuan Dezhi, the Party branch secretary of the farm implement factory, told him about the factory's long-term plan: "This factory will develop into a medium-sized farm implement factory, capable of manufacturing large and small farm implements, and undertaking major agricultural machinery repairs without going outside the county. In the future, it will also manufacture power machinery." Wang Dawan was very excited when he heard this. He made up his mind to rely on everyone and his own hands to build the factory better.

    At that time, the workshop was rushing to make water lifting tools. He saw several people from the commune in the workshop and asked Wang Wenbin next to him: "What are they doing?" Xiao Wang told him: "They are from the Jindian Commune waiting for animal-powered water wheels. One water wheel can save eight laborers." Xiao Wang's words deeply moved Wang Dawan's heart. He thought to himself: How much mechanical equipment is needed in the countryside now! A county farm implement factory bears such a great task for the county's agricultural production and agricultural technical transformation! He felt even more that his task was both arduous and glorious. From here, he began to combine the great ideal of changing the face of the countryside with his daily labor.

    After working in the workshop for a few days, Wang Dawan felt that the production plan was a bit chaotic. He discussed with the leaders and adopted a method of long-term planning and short-term arrangements, planning every day to the team, assigning tasks to individuals, and rationally dividing labor, so that the tasks were thoroughly implemented and grasped by the masses. At the same time, when making monthly plans, he also took the initiative to tell the brother workshops about the workshop's plan, so that the upper and lower processes were better connected and the cooperative relationship was closer. After each task was issued, Wang Dawan went deep into the key areas and worked with the comrades to overcome the difficulties. For example, at one time, the scythe tooth of the three-toothed weeder could not keep up with the assembly progress because the scythe tooth was sawed by hand, section by section, which was inefficient. He discussed with everyone to temporarily change the punch press into a shearing machine, one shear at a time, which increased efficiency by more than ten times. Because Comrade Wang Dawan closely relied on the masses, strengthened plan management, and vigorously carried out technical innovation, the workshop's production exceeded the plan every month.

    Wang Dawan loved this factory more and more, and he cared about every big and small thing in the factory. He saw that the tools in the workshop were placed in a mess, so he used his rest time to tidy them up. At the same time, he suggested that the workshop establish a tool management system and promoted to the workers: "Fighting relies on guns, production relies on tools. If the tools are not managed well, it will affect production." Under Wang Dawan's influence, everyone stopped throwing tools around. In order not to affect production, he sometimes used the gaps when everyone stopped working to repair machines. On July 15th, it was the factory's holiday. Wang Dawan and eight workers decided to use the holiday to overhaul the machines. After obtaining the leadership's consent, they carried out a day and a night of blitz, solving three problems: raising the chimney, overhauling the overhead beams, and overhauling and changing water in the boiler, ensuring the smooth progress of production. Wang Dawan worked diligently, and many workers were deeply moved. The workers said: Director Wang is really a good example for us to learn from.

    Once, the factory was rushing to make three-toothed weeders, but the washers were missing and could not be matched. This became the key to the factory's production. The Party branch mobilized everyone to overcome the difficulties. Some people suggested using the sand casting method to make washers, but the castings were too thick and large, and they were useless. Wang Dawan wanted to make them himself, but the factory did not have quenching equipment and could not make a punching die, so he wanted to return to Wuhan to solve this key problem. When Wang Dawan returned to the Wuhan Automobile Factory and talked about the difficulties of the county farm implement factory, the factory leaders immediately agreed to help them solve it. The employees also enthusiastically helped him, actively looking for waste materials and using the machine tool downtime at night to process them. After two nights of work, they finally made more than a thousand washers. Wang Dawan happily returned to the county farm implement factory with this batch of washers, and the employees were even more overjoyed when they saw them.

    Wang Dawan wholeheartedly supported agricultural technical transformation and worked solidly, greatly changing the production appearance of the farm implement factory's backward workshop—the fitter workshop—and it was rated as a red flag workshop. Originally, everyone called it the "dragon's tail," but now it has become the "dragon's head."

    王大万到县农具厂落户	共青团武汉市委写作小组
    今年3月，中共武汉市委发出城市支援农村、工业支援农业的号召，武汉汽车厂工人王大万立即向党支部报了名。他向党支部书记夏方敏说：“我出身在农村，在农村放过牛。现在要大办农业、大办粮食，大搞农业技术改造，需要技术工人，我愿意去和农民兄弟一道加速建设新农村。”
    王大万得到批准，高高兴兴地回家去，告诉他父亲。父亲一听就怔住了：“为什么放着汽车厂的事不干，要到县里的小厂去？”晚上，他同弟弟一起去劝说父亲。他对父亲说：“解放以后农村已经有很大的变化，但和我们国家建设的要求比起来，生产还是落后的。要更快地改变农村面貌，就需要输送机器和技术工人支援农村。这是一项重大、光荣的任务。……”兄弟俩耐心地说服了父亲。临走的那天，老人家欢欢喜喜地一直把王大万送上车，并且一再叮嘱他要好好地干。
    王大万一到云梦县，一片跃进的景象就深深地吸引了他。特别是在金店人民公社参观时，看到农民把大批蔬菜和生猪供给城市，他就想：“农民弟兄积极支援工业建设，我们工人就应该全心全意支援农业，加速改变农村技术面貌。来到云梦，就要献出全力，把云梦建设好。”
    王大万被分配到县农具厂钳工车间担任副主任。一开始，他有些不习惯。看见厂里设备不多，大部分是皮带车床，脑子里不由得闪过一个念头：“这样的设备，完成任务有困难啊！”可是，他回头一想“王大万啊！你是怎么想的？大厂小厂条件不同，怎么光拿好的地方来比呢？”他回忆起：自己刚进武汉汽车厂时，厂里大部分也是皮带车床，人数也不多，同县农具厂比起来，也强不了多少呀！农具厂党支部书记袁德志向他讲述了工厂的远景规划：“这个厂要发展成为中型农具厂，能够制造大小农具，担任农业机械大修不出县的任务，将来还要制造动力机械。”王大万听了非常兴奋。他下定决心，要依靠大家，依靠自己的双手，把工厂建设得更好。
    当时，车间里正在赶制提水工具。他看见车间里有几个公社的人，就问旁边的王文斌：“他们是干什么的？”小王告诉他：“他们是金店公社等着要畜力水车的。一部水车可以节约八个劳动力。”小王的话深深地打动了王大万的心，他暗自想道：当前农村里多么需要机械设备呵！一个县农具厂对全县的农业生产和农业技术改造担负了多么大的任务！他更加感到自己的任务既艰巨又光荣。从这里，他开始把改变农村面貌的远大理想和自己的日常劳动结合起来了。
    在车间里工作几天以后，王大万感到生产计划有点乱，他就和领导方面研究采取长计划短安排，计划天天到组，任务落实到人，合理分工的办法，把任务一竿子插到底，交给群众掌握。同时，在每月制订计划时，他又主动把车间计划告诉兄弟车间，这样，上下工序衔接得更好，协作关系也更加密切了。每次任务下达后，王大万就深入到关键地方和同志们一起攻关。例如，有一度三齿耘锄的肖子赶不上装配的进度，原因是肖子是用手工一段一段锯断的，效率低。他就和大家一起商量，把冲床临时改成剪床，一剪就是一个，效率提高十多倍。由于王大万同志紧紧依靠群众，加强计划管理，大搞技术革新，车间生产月月都超额完成计划。
    王大万越来越爱这个工厂，他关心着厂里大大小小的每一件事。他看到车间工具放得乱，就利用休息时间把它收拾起来。同时一面建议车间建立工具管理制度，一面向工人宣传：“打仗靠枪，生产靠工具，工具没有管好，就会影响生产。”在王大万的影响下，大家都不乱丢工具了。为了不影响生产，他有时还利用大家停工休息的空隙维修机器。7月15日那天，正是厂里的假日，王大万和八个工人决心要利用假日检修机器。经过领导同意后，他们突击了一天一晚上，解决了烟囱加高、天杠检修、锅炉检修换水三个问题，保证了生产的顺利进行。王大万勤勤恳恳地工作，许多工人很受感动。工人们都说：王主任真是我们学习的好榜样。
    有一次，厂里赶制三齿耘锄，因为缺少垫圈不能配套。这成了厂里生产的关键。党支部就发动大家攻关。有的人建议用翻砂办法来做垫圈，可是翻出来的又厚又大，不管用。王大万想自己来做，但是厂里没有淬火设备，造不出冲模，他就想回武汉去解决这个关键问题。王大万回到武汉汽车厂，谈到县农具厂的困难，厂领导上立即答应帮助他们解决。职工们也热情地帮助他，积极找废料，利用晚上机床空歇的时间来加工，干了两夜，终于做成了一千多个垫圈。王大万高高兴兴地带着这批垫圈回到县农具厂，职工们见了更是喜出望外。
    王大万全心全意支援农业技术改造，扎扎实实地作工作，使农具厂落后车间——钳工车间的生产面貌大大改观，被评为红旗车间。原来大家称它是“龙尾”，现在变成了“龙头”。
