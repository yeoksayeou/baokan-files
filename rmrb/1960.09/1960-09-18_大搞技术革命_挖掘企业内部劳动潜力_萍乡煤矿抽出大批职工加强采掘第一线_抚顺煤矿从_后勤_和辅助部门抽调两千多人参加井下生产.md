　　Launch a Great Technical Revolution, Tap Internal Labor Potential of Enterprises
　　Pingxiang Coal Mine Draws a Large Number of Employees to Strengthen the Coal Mining Frontline
　　Fushun Coal Mine Transfers More Than 2,000 People from "Logistics" and Auxiliary Departments to Participate in Underground Production

Xinhua News Agency, Nanchang, 17th. In the movement to increase production and practice economy, the employees of Pingxiang Coal Mine in Jiangxi Province have tried every possible means to tap internal labor potential, drawing 800 outstanding cadres and more than 1,300 strong workers from the surface to strengthen the coal mining frontline. The entire mine quickly saw a new leap forward situation with accelerated extraction and tunneling, and a steady rise in raw coal production.
　　Cadres of Pingxiang Coal Mine vigorously improved their work style and went deep into the mine to solve problems practically and specifically, which promoted a 30% increase in the daily output of raw coal in the second half of June. However, after production had a new leap forward, the original working faces urgently needed to be extended, and new working faces needed to be added quickly. Therefore, the underground mining strength engaged in direct production must also be strengthened accordingly. However, where would the new mining strength come from? After explaining the current leap forward situation to all employees, the Pingxiang Coal Mine Party Committee immediately mobilized the vast number of employees to discuss and solve this problem.
　　After discussion, the vast number of employees unanimously agreed that the only realistic way was to resolutely tap labor potential internally and fill all the labor force on the ground that could go down the well into the most important production departments in the well. However, in recent years, Pingxiang Coal Mine has always been in the spirit of increasing production with fewer people, and has tapped a lot of labor potential to strengthen the production department. In the first half of this year, it has achieved a great increase in raw coal production despite the lack of more than 2,000 laborers. So, is there still labor potential that can be tapped now? A large number of workers in the coal washing plant of Gaokeng Mine proposed that after the technical revolution in the plant, the work efficiency has been improved and the workload has been reduced, and a group of people can be drawn to go down the well. The workers in the waste recycling department of Qingshan Mine took the initiative to propose that the workload of their nine people could be undertaken by four or five people with greater efforts, saving half of the labor force to fill the well.
　　The Pingxiang Coal Mine Party Committee cherished the enthusiasm and revolutionary vigor of the vast number of employees, immediately vigorously supported the demands of the masses, and guided all employees to put forward specific methods for tapping labor potential in light of the actual situation of the mine. The vast number of employees put forward many useful and feasible suggestions. Employees of various departments and various types of work first pointed the spearhead of tapping labor potential to the technical revolution centered on saving labor. For example, the coal washing plant of Gaokeng Mine further promoted a number of new machines, realizing mechanization and semi-mechanization of loading, coal transfer, and mud coal extraction, and automation of the coal washing process. Since mid-July, it has successively saved more than 400 main labor forces to support underground production. While carrying out the technical revolution, the employees of various departments and production mines vigorously saved non-production personnel and auxiliary production personnel in the spirit of increasing production and reducing personnel. Since mid-July, the entire mining bureau has saved more than 700 non-production personnel and auxiliary production personnel to fill the frontline underground. In order to allow male laborers working on the ground to be used as much as possible to go down the well, female employees and family members of employees of all types of work volunteered to take on more work on the ground to replace male laborers.
　　Among the large number of laborers tapped out in these units, some of them were physically weak and not suitable for underground labor. They put forward the method of "topping" and went to work in some departments where the staffing could not be reduced but the labor intensity was relatively light, topping out the physically stronger laborers in these departments to go down the well. In addition, employees of various production mines also proposed the method of "concurrent operation." For example, 42 production team leaders who were detached from production in Qingshan Mine automatically went down the well to participate in production, acting as both team leaders and workers, which also greatly strengthened the underground production force.

Xinhua News Agency, Fushun. Recently, Fushun Coal Mine transferred a batch of laborers from the "logistics" department and auxiliary departments to strengthen the coal mining frontline. The first batch of more than 2,300 people has gone deep into the mines and open-pit mines and joined the first-line workers in the upsurge of increasing production and practicing economy.
　　Strengthening the coal mining frontline is an important measure taken by the Fushun Coal Mine Party organization to ensure better completion of the annual production tasks. Some time ago, several secretaries and the director of the mining area Party committee led a work group to the coal mining frontline of the Laohutai Mine and the Longfeng Mine. They used the method of dissecting "sparrows" to summarize the experience of overfulfilling half of the annual coal production plan in the first half of the year, and conducted a comprehensive investigation and study of the labor situation in the mining area. According to the characteristics and requirements that the natural conditions of coal mine production underground mining operations often change, there are many coal mining working faces, and tunneling must catch up with coal mining needs, they concluded that it is necessary to concentrate forces and strengthen key points - the coal mining frontline, believing that this is an important measure to ensure the overfulfillment of this year's increase production and practice economy plan. At the same time, through investigation and research, they also found the following situations: on the one hand, the labor force in the coal mining frontline is relatively weak, and on the other hand, there is a lot of labor potential in various auxiliary departments and various "logistics" departments. The batch of laborers recently filled into the coal mining frontline was transferred by the mining area Party committee after reasonably adjusting the existing labor organization based on the above situation.

### 大搞技术革命　挖掘企业内部劳动潜力  萍乡煤矿抽出大批职工加强采掘第一线  抚顺煤矿从“后勤”和辅助部门抽调两千多人参加井下生产

    大搞技术革命　挖掘企业内部劳动潜力
    萍乡煤矿抽出大批职工加强采掘第一线
    抚顺煤矿从“后勤”和辅助部门抽调两千多人参加井下生产
    本报南昌17日电　江西萍乡煤矿职工在增产节约运动中，千方百计挖掘内部劳动潜力，从地面抽出八百名优秀干部、一千三百多名强壮工人，加强采掘第一线，全矿迅速出现了回采、掘进加快，原煤产量节节上升的新的跃进局面。
    萍乡煤矿干部大力改进工作作风，深入井下切实具体解决问题，曾促使6月下半月原煤日产量增长30％，但当生产有了新的跃进以后，原有的掌子面急需伸展，新的掌子面要求迅速增加，因此，从事直接生产的井下采掘力量也必须相应地加强。然而，新的采掘力量从哪里来呢？萍乡煤矿党委在向全体职工说明了当前的跃进形势之后，立即发动广大职工来讨论解决这个问题。
    广大职工经过讨论一致认为，只有坚决从内部挖掘劳动潜力，把地面上一切可以下井的劳动力充实到井下最重要的生产部门中去，才是现实的途径。但是，萍乡煤矿在最近几年来，一直本着增产增事少增人的精神，挖掘出不少劳动潜力，加强了生产部门。今年上半年就在缺乏两千多名劳动力的情况下，取得了原煤生产大幅度增长的巨大成绩。那么，现在是否还有劳动潜力可以挖掘呢？高坑矿洗煤厂大批工人提出，本厂技术革命以后，工效提高了，工作量减轻了，完全可以抽出一批人下井。青山矿材料部门回收废料的工人，主动提出他们九个人的工作量，只要发挥更大的干劲，就完全可以由四、五个人担当下来，节约出一半劳动力充实井下。
    萍乡煤矿党委十分珍惜广大职工的满腔热情和冲天的革命干劲，立即大力支持了职工群众的要求，并且引导全体职工针对本矿的实际情况，广泛提出挖掘劳动潜力的具体办法。广大职工提出了许多有益的、并且是切实可行的建议。各部门、各工种职工，首先把挖掘劳动潜力的锋芒，指向以节约劳动力为中心的技术革命。如高坑矿洗煤厂进一步推广了一批新机具，实现了装车、转煤、取泥煤机械化、半机械化和洗煤过程自动化，从7月中旬以来，就先后节约出四百多名主要劳动力，支援了井下生产。在大搞技术革命的同时，各部门、各生产矿的职工，又本着增产增事又减人的精神，大力节约地面非生产人员和辅助生产人员。全矿务局从7月中旬起到目前为止，已经节约出七百多名非生产人员和辅助生产人员充实井下第一线。为了让地面上工作的男劳动力能尽量用到井下去，各工种的女职工和职工家属，都纷纷自告奋勇，要求多担负一些地面上的工作，以代替男劳动力。
    在这些单位挖掘出来的大批劳动力中，有一部分人体力较弱不适合井下劳动，他们就提出了“顶”的办法，到某些不能再减少定员但劳动强度比较轻的部门去工作，顶出这些部门中体力较强的劳动力下井。另外，各生产矿职工还提出了“兼职作业”的办法。如青山矿四十二名脱离生产的生产组长，自动下井参加生产，既是组长又是工人，这样也大大加强了井下生产力量。
    据新华社抚顺电　抚顺煤矿最近从“后勤”部门和辅助部门抽调出一批劳动力，加强了采掘第一线。第一批两千三百多人已经深入到矿井和露天矿坑，同第一线工人一道投入了增产节约竞赛热潮。
    加强采掘第一线，是抚顺煤矿党组织为保证更好地完成全年生产任务而采取的一项重要措施。前些时候，矿区党委的几名书记和局长率领工作组到老虎台矿和龙凤矿采掘第一线，采用解剖“麻雀”的办法，总结了上半年超额完成全年煤炭生产计划一半的经验，并且对矿区的劳动力状况进行了全面的调查研究。他们根据煤矿生产井下采掘作业自然条件经常变化，采煤工作面多，掘进必须赶上采煤需要等特点和要求，得出了必须集中力量，加强重点——井下采掘第一线的结论，认为这是保证超额完成今年增产节约计划的重要措施。同时，他们通过调查研究，还发现了以下的情况：一方面采掘第一线劳动力比较薄弱，另一方面在各个辅助部门和各个“后勤”部门，都有许多劳动潜力。最近充实到采掘第一线的一批劳动力，就是矿区党委根据以上情况，对现有劳动组织进行了合理调整之后调出来的。
