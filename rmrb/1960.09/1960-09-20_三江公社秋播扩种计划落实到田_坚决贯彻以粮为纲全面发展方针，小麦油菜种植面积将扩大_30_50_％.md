Xinhua News Agency Report: The Sanjiang Commune in Chongqing County, Sichuan Province, in planning for the autumn planting, resolutely implemented the policy of taking grain as the key link and promoting all-round development. They mobilized the masses to tap the potential of the land, achieving "three expansions" in the planting area of food crops, industrial raw material crops, and green manure crops. Moreover, the measures are practical, the seeds required for expanding the planting area have been prepared, and the commune members are rushing to plow the fields and accumulate fertilizer to ensure early and good planting.

The Sanjiang Commune is one of the advanced communes in Chongqing County. The commune members have deeply realized the correctness of the policy of combining multiple planting with high yields through the fact that grain and oil production in the entire commune have made continuous leaps forward for many years. Therefore, the cadres and commune members of the entire commune are even more motivated in preparing for this year's autumn planting and are determined to further expand the planting area to create conditions for harvesting more crops next summer. However, the planting area in the plains area was already expanded a lot last autumn. If we continue to expand this autumn, where will the arable land come from? Furthermore, will expanding the planting area of food crops squeeze out the area of industrial raw material crops and green manure? If the autumn planting area is expanded, and the summer harvest period is extended, will it hinder the timely planting of autumn harvest crops? The commune party committee raised these questions to everyone and mobilized the masses for repeated discussions.

During the discussion, each production team carefully summarized the high-yield experience of various summer harvest crops this year, studied the growth characteristics of the crops, and on this basis, looked for ways to expand the area. Through discussion and analysis, everyone realized that in the past, they only paid attention to using good fields for replanting, and neglected low-yielding paddy fields. A considerable part of the paddy fields were not fully utilized in the autumn planting season; some overwintering crops (such as rapeseed, etc.) grow slowly in the early stage with small leaves and have wide spaces between rows, which are also positions for expansion. Based on this analysis, the commune party committee immediately guided the masses to take two steps to expand the autumn planting area. First, everyone used their brains to "check for empty seats" and utilize all usable land such as vacant fields originally rotated during the autumn planting season, empty spaces between rows of crops, and scattered plots. In this way, the entire commune found a total of thirty-four methods for expanding planting such as intercropping, mixed cropping, and increased planting. Second, implement "assigned seating," that is, according to the nature of the fields, the growth characteristics of the main crops and intercropped/mixed crops, the amount of empty space between rows in the main crop fields, and the possible period of intercropping/mixed cropping, match them accordingly to ensure that "every field is not empty, and there are crops at all times."

After the possibility of expanding planting was found, each production team first ensured the expansion of the wheat planting area when arranging specific expansion plans, and moved some other crops that could be transplanted to other places according to the principle of adapting to local conditions. For example, the shade-loving and wet-loving thick-skinned vegetables that were originally planted in large fields were changed to be planted in forest land, and barley and broad beans, which are not picky about the land and have the effect of improving the soil, were changed to be planted in paddy fields, freeing up good fields for planting wheat. In this way, the wheat area was expanded without affecting the area and yield of other crops. In addition, food crops are also intercropped/mixed first in all industrial raw material crop fields that can be intercropped/mixed.

Secondly, in terms of oil crops, more than 1,000 mu of rapeseed was expanded by changing pure-planting green manure to intercropping green manure. In the past, this commune only intercropped green manure in some rapeseed fields and barley fields, and no green manure was intercropped in wheat fields. Now, in addition to universally intercropping green manure in rapeseed and barley fields, the method of wide-ridge strip planting is also adopted, and green manure milk vetch is also universally intercropped in wheat fields, which is not only conducive to wheat ventilation and light transmission, but also milk vetch has root nodules that can promote high wheat yields. Broad bean seedlings are also universally intercropped as green manure in paddy fields. Although the area of ​​pure-planting green manure has decreased, the total green manure area in the entire commune has also increased compared with last autumn due to the increase in intercropping, calculated in terms of the equivalent of pure-planting area.

After repeated discussions and revisions from bottom to top and from top to bottom, the area of ​​food crops, industrial raw material crops, and green manure crops in the entire commune has been greatly expanded, and the plans are quickly posted and implemented in the fields, so that the plan to expand the area is truly rooted in the masses. Among them, food crops, mainly wheat, were expanded by 50.4% compared with last year, industrial raw material crops, mainly rapeseed, were expanded by 30%, and green manure was expanded by 4%. In order not to affect the timely planting of autumn harvest crops next year, in addition to paying attention to the connection between front and rear crops in the above arrangements and using intercropped green manure as base fertilizer for next year, the commune also plans to plant "Victory Rapeseed," which can be planted early, half a month earlier in order to strive for early harvest and vacate the fields early. Wheat, which is harvested late and easily depletes the soil, is arranged to be planted in arable land near the breeding farm, canteen, and main road. The fields farther away from the breeding farm, canteen, and main road are intercropped with more green manure to increase the amount of fertilizer self-supplied in the distant fields, so as to shorten the time for transporting base fertilizer next year and ensure timely planting of autumn harvest crops.

Once the arable land for expansion was implemented, the commune party committee vigorously grasped high-yield measures and implemented the "Eight-Character Constitution" of agriculture. First of all, seize the preparation of fertilizers needed for autumn planting. Achieve "six implementations" of fertilizer source, field plots, quantity, quality, labor, and time, set fertilizer accumulation quotas and bonus for exceeding the quota according to the labor grading standards; and take measures such as awarding prizes to organize extra-grade labor to participate in the fertilizer accumulation activities within their capabilities. At the same time, strengthen pig breeding and management to promote pig growth and field fertilization. In addition, the commune and various management districts have set up local fertilizer factories to produce fertilizers and implement three transformations: that is, transform low-yield fields, switch to high-yielding varieties, and increase the yield of low-yield crops to ensure large-area balanced high yields.

In order to ensure the implementation of the above-mentioned production increase measures, the entire commune has invested more than 85% of its labor force in the first line of agricultural production from now on, and has adopted four methods to improve labor efficiency and save labor. First, all more than 1,000 cadres above the team level in the entire commune participate in group labor, adhere to "four togethers," and take the lead in carrying out high-efficiency and super-quota competitions. Second, grasp the life during the busy farming season, run the canteens well, and ensure that the commune members eat well and eat cleanly and hygienically. Medical personnel patrol the fields to prevent diseases, so that everyone is strong and energetic and actively labors. Third, do as much of the farm work that can be done in advance as possible to avoid the concentration of farm work during the autumn planting period, so as to free up more labor for rushing to plant. Fourth, reform all labor procedures that can be reformed to save labor to the maximum extent. For example, in the past, the accumulation and application of base fertilizer for autumn planting was generally a two-step process, that is, the accumulated fertilizer was first piled in a certain place, and then transported to the field; this year, the method of accumulating fertilizer on the side of the field, applying it while accumulating it, and plowing the field while applying it is adopted. In this way, three workdays can be saved for applying base fertilizer to one mu of land. The entire commune will save 66,000 workdays for only the two items of wheat and rapeseed fields by adopting this method of accumulating and applying base fertilizer.

Now, the cadres and commune members of the entire commune are full of spirit and high morale, and are working hard to realize the above-mentioned plan. All management districts are taking advantage of the current period of lush green grass to strengthen the feeding of draught cattle, adding 50 to 70 jin of green grass every night to make them fatten up and increase their strength, accelerate the progress of autumn plowing, and ensure timely sowing. Fertilizer accumulation and fertilizer production are even more hot, and the entire commune has accumulated nearly 3,000 jin of high-quality fertilizer for each mu of autumn planting crops. The party members, members of the Communist Youth League, and cadres of the entire commune also contracted to transform low-yield fields, and implemented ditching and ridge building for paddy fields, and applied fertilizer and drained water in advance. The commune members happily said: "A tall building starts from the ground. This year we have laid a solid foundation, and we will have more confidence in high yields next year."

    三江公社秋播扩种计划落实到田
    坚决贯彻以粮为纲全面发展方针，小麦油菜种植面积将扩大30—50％
    据新华社讯　四川崇庆县三江公社在规划秋种中坚决贯彻以粮为纲、全面发展的方针，发动群众大挖土地潜力，做到了粮食作物、工业原料作物和绿肥作物种植面积“三扩大”。而且措施切实，扩大种植面积所需的各项种子已经备齐，社员们正在突击犁田、积肥，保证种早种好。
    三江公社是崇庆县的先进公社之一。全社粮食、油料生产连年跃进的事实，使社员们深刻地认识到多种多收和高产多收相结合的方针的正确性。因此，全社干部和社员在准备今年秋种中干劲更足，决心进一步扩大种植面积，为明年夏季收获更多作物创造条件。但是，平坝地区去秋已经扩种很多，今秋再继续扩种，耕地从何而来？再说，扩大粮食作物种植面积，会不会挤掉工业原料作物和绿肥面积？秋种面积扩大了，明年夏收期延长，会不会妨碍秋收作物的适时栽插？公社党委把这些问题都提到大家面前，发动群众反复讨论。
    讨论中，各生产队都细致地总结了今年各种夏收作物的高产经验，研究作物生长特点，并在此基础上寻找扩大面积的办法。通过讨论和分析，大家发觉过去只注意利用好田来复种，忽视了低产漕田，有相当一部分漕田在秋种这季没被充分利用；有些越冬作物（如油菜等）前期生长慢，叶片小，复盖不大，行间空得宽，也是扩种的阵地。根据这一分析，公社党委即引导群众采取两个步骤来扩大秋种面积。第一，人人动脑筋，“查空座位”，把秋种这季中原来轮歇的空田、作物行间空隙地、零星地等一切可以利用的土地都利用起来。这样，全社一共找出套种、间种、增种等三十四种扩种办法。第二，实行“对座入席”，即根据田土性质，正种作物和间、套种作物的生长特性，正种作物田内行间空隙地的多少，以及可能间、套种的期限，进行对号搭配，保证做到“块块田不空，时时都有作物”。
    扩种的可能找到后，在安排具体扩种计划时，各生产队都首先保证小麦种植面积的扩大，根据因地制宜的原则，将一部分能够移地种植的其他作物移到他处。如将原来种在大田里的喜阴湿的厚皮菜改种到林地，将不择地的大麦和具有改良土壤效力的胡豆改种到漕田内，腾出好田种小麦。这样，既扩大了小麦面积，又不影响其他作物的面积和产量。此外，凡能够间种、套种的工业原料作物田也首先间种、套种粮食作物。
    其次，在油料方面，由于改净种绿肥为间种绿肥，腾出地来扩大了一千多亩油菜。过去这个公社只在部分油菜田和大麦田内间种绿肥，小麦田都不间种绿肥。现在除在油菜、大麦田内普遍间种绿肥外，还采取宽畦条播的办法，在小麦田内也普遍间种绿肥苕子，这样既有利于小麦通风透光，同时苕子有根瘤菌还能促使小麦高产。漕田内也普遍间种胡豆秧绿肥。绿肥净种面积虽然减少了一部分，但由于间种增多，折合净种面积计算，全社绿肥面积也比去秋增加。
    经过由下而上、由上而下反复讨论和修改，全社粮食作物，工业原料作物和绿肥作物的面积都大大扩大，并且迅速插牌落实到田，使扩大面积的计划真正在群众中落脚生根。其中，以小麦为主的粮食作物比去年扩大50.4％，以油菜为主的工业原料作物扩大30％，绿肥扩大4％。为了不影响明年秋收作物适时栽插，公社除了在以上安排中注意前后作物衔接，间种绿肥作明年底肥外，还有计划地把能够提前栽种的，“胜利油菜”提前半月栽种，以争取提前收获，早腾田。收获较迟而又容易瘦田的小麦，安排在饲养场、食堂、大路附近的耕地种植。将离饲养场、食堂和大路较远的田，更多的间种绿肥，增加远田自给肥料数量，以便缩短明年运送底肥的时间，保证秋收作物及时栽插。
    扩种的耕地一落实，公社党委就狠抓高产措施，贯彻农业“八字宪法”。首先，抓紧准备秋种所需的肥料。做到肥源、田块、数量、质量、劳力、时间“六落实”，按劳力分级的标准定积肥额、超额奖励；并采取给奖等办法，组织级外劳力参加力所胜任的积肥活动。与此同时，加强猪只饲养管理，促使猪长肉、田增肥。此外，公社和各个管理区都办了土化肥厂造化肥，并实行三项改造：即改造低产田、改用高产品种、提高低产作物的产量，保证大面积平衡高产。
    为了保证贯彻上述增产措施，全社从现在起就将85％以上劳动力投入了农业生产第一线，并且采取四种办法来提高劳动效率和节约劳力。首先，全社一千多名队以上的干部一律参加小组劳动，坚持“四同”，带头开展高工效、超定额竞赛。第二，抓好农忙时期的生活，办好食堂，保证社员吃好、吃得干净卫生。医务人员巡回田间，预防疾病，使人人身强力壮，积极劳动。第三，将能够提前做的农活尽量提前，避免秋种期农活集中，以便腾出更多的劳动力抢种。第四，改革一切可以改革的劳动程序，最大限度地节省劳动力。如过去积施秋种底肥一般是二道工序，即先把积的肥料堆放在一定地点，然后再运送到田；今年则采取田边积肥，边积边施、边施边犁田的办法。这样，施一亩地的底肥即可节省三个工。全社仅小麦、油菜田两项采取这个办法积施底肥，就要节省六万六千个工。
    现在，全社干部和社员都意气风发，干劲高涨，正为实现上述规划而努力。各个管理区都趁当前青草茂盛时期，加强耕牛饲养，每夜加喂五十斤至七十斤青草，使其添膘增力，加快秋耕进度，保证及时播种。积肥造肥更是搞得火热，全社目前已给每亩秋种作物积了优质肥料近三千斤。全社的党员、团员和干部还包干改造低产田，对漕田实行了开沟垒畦，提前排水施肥。社员们兴高彩烈地说：“万丈高楼从地起，今年我们把基础打得硬，明年高产多收的把握就更大了。”
