　　"Great Wisdom Appears Foolish"
　　Li Zi
    "Great wisdom appears foolish," this saying is very insightful. When a person is determined to have lofty aspirations, is resolute and tenacious, and works wholeheartedly, in the eyes of those who consider themselves a bit clever, they do indeed seem to have a foolish air about them.
    During the Anti-Japanese War, Comrade Mao Zedong used the ancient Chinese fable of "The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains" to encourage us. The Foolish Old Man was determined to move away the Taihang and Wangwu Mountains. In the eyes of the Wise Old Man, he was really foolish, but who was truly wise?
    Since the Anti-Japanese War, there have been two kinds of educated youth: One kind of educated youth listened to the Party, set lofty aspirations, and wanted to overthrow the three great mountains of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucrat-capitalism. They had a revolutionary foolish spirit, were unafraid of hardship and sacrifice, were heroic and tenacious, and advanced bravely. Finally, under the correct leadership of the Party, they fought alongside the people and achieved victory, becoming revolutionary heroes. Another kind of educated youth thought themselves very clever, not caring about the rise and fall of the nation or the success or failure of the revolution, clinging tightly to their own little fame and fortune. At that time, in their eyes, the classmates and friends who participated in the revolution were really foolish. But who was truly wise?
    Today, we have entered the period of socialist construction, and the debate between the Foolish Old Man and the Wise Old Man has reappeared. There are also two kinds of educated youth: One kind of educated youth listens to the Party and goes to the places in the motherland that are most needed and most difficult. They set lofty aspirations to remove the two great mountains of "poverty" and "blankness." The Party pointed out that agriculture should be the foundation, so they went to the countryside, determined to build a new socialist countryside. They also have a revolutionary foolish spirit, they are also not afraid of difficulties or hardship, they are heroic and tenacious, and they advance bravely. They will inevitably, under the correct leadership of the Party, together with the broad masses of people, achieve brilliant construction achievements and become heroes in building a prosperous and strong motherland. Another kind of educated youth, they are a minority, think themselves very clever, not caring about the needs of the motherland's construction, and still clinging to their own little fame and fortune. Today, in their eyes, the classmates and friends who go to the most difficult places and to the agricultural front are really foolish. But who is truly wise?
    "Great wisdom appears foolish." Truly intelligent people all have this little bit of foolishness. In the revolutionary cause, the debate between the Foolish Old Man and the Wise Old Man is actually a debate between collectivism and individualism. In the great revolutionary construction cause, there must be people with this kind of revolutionary foolish spirit, proceeding from the collective and national interests, without any selfish or self-interested plans. The more revolutionary fools there are, the more prosperous the revolutionary cause will be, and the more brilliant the construction achievements will be.
    Young people, let us all become people who love the motherland, love the collective, love the countryside, love labor, are not afraid of hardship, and strive to become strong, become "Foolish Old Men" of "great wisdom appearing foolish"!

### “大智若愚”

　　“大智若愚”
　　李梓
    “大智若愚”，这句话说得很透。当一个人抱定雄心大志，坚决顽强，全心全意干的时候，在那些自以为有点小聪明的人眼里，的确像有一股傻气。
    在抗日战争时期，毛泽东同志用“愚公移山”的中国古代寓言激励我们。愚公立下雄心大志想把太行山、王屋山移走。在智叟眼里，实在傻得很，但是，到底是谁聪明呢？
    从抗日战争以来，有那么两种知识青年：一种知识青年，听党的话，立下雄心大志，要推翻帝国主义、封建主义、官僚资本主义这三座大山。他们有一股革命的傻劲，不畏艰险、不怕牺牲，英勇顽强、奋勇直前，终于在党的正确领导下，和人民群众一起战斗到胜利，成了革命英雄。另一种知识青年，自以为聪明得很，不问国家兴亡，革命成败，紧守着自己的一点名利。当时，在他们的眼里，参加革命的同学和朋友，实在傻得很。但是，到底是谁聪明呢？
    今天，我们进入了社会主义建设时期，愚公和智叟之争又出现了。也有那么两种知识青年：一种知识青年，听党的话，到祖国最需要最艰苦的地方去。他们立下雄心大志要搬掉“一穷”“二白”的两座大山。党指出要以农业为基础，他们就到农村去，决心建设社会主义新农村。他们也有一股革命的傻劲，他们也不畏艰难，不怕困苦，英勇顽强，奋勇直前，他们也必然会在党的正确领导下，和广大人民群众一起取得建设的辉煌成绩，成为建设富强祖国的英雄。另一种知识青年，他们是少数，自以为聪明得很，不问什么祖国建设事业的需要，还是紧守着个人的一点点名利。今天，在他们的眼里，到最艰苦的地方，到农业战线上去的同学和朋友实在傻气。但是到底是谁聪明呢？
    “大智若愚”。真正的聪明人，都有这么一点傻气。在革命事业中，愚公和智叟之争，实际上是集体主义和个人主义之争。在革命的伟大建设事业中，就必须有这种从集体的全民利益出发，没有一点自私自利打算的革命傻气的人。这种革命的傻子越多，革命事业就越兴旺，建设的成就就越辉煌。
    青年人，让我们都来作热爱祖国，热爱集体，热爱农村，热爱劳动，不畏艰险，发愤图强的人，作“大智若愚”的“愚公”！
