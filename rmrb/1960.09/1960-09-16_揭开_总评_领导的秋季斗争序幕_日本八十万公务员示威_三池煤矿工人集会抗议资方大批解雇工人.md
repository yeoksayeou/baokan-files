Xinhua News Agency, 15th dispatch: Tokyo News: Eight hundred thousand Japanese national government employees simultaneously held rallies and demonstrations in over six hundred locations nationwide today, unveiling the prelude to the autumn struggle led by the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan (Sohyo).

    Their unified demands included: a uniform wage increase of 3,000 yen; opposition to the "performance rating" system that restricts the political freedom of teachers; and opposition to the suppression of workers.
    In Tokyo today, over ten thousand civil servants held a central rally. The rally unanimously passed a resolution opposing the government's policy of neglecting wage increases, demanding that a uniform wage increase of 3,000 yen be paid from the national budget.
    The rally passed a resolution stating that they would launch a struggle against the "performance rating" system, which aims to promote reactionary education and undermine teachers' unions, and force the government to change its labor policies.
    The rally resolutely stated in its resolution that they would smash the illegal suppression of workers under the pretext of the "Hagerty Incident" and other such events.
    The rally also passed a declaration stating that 1.5 million civil servants across Japan would continue to fight with all their strength.
    Suzuki Ichizo, a member of the Presidium of the Japanese Communist Party Central Committee, delivered a speech at the rally. He emphasized that today's unified action by civil servants would mark the beginning of a new stage in the struggle against the "Security Treaty."
    After the rally, all participants held demonstrations in front of the Diet, the Prime Minister's Official Residence, the Ministry of Education, and the Ministry of Finance.
    Meanwhile, the Japan Teachers' Union today conducted negotiations with local government education committees across the country, opposing the implementation of the "performance rating" system. Today was the final day of the nationwide unified action launched by the Japan Teachers' Union on September 1st to oppose the "performance rating" system.
    In Tokyo, Takeshi Kobayashi, Chairman of the Japan Teachers' Union, led a thousand teachers to the Ministry of Education, lodging a serious protest against the Minister of Education's refusal to negotiate with representatives of the Teachers' Union.
    To support the struggle of civil servants, over four hundred students held a rally in Tokyo today to oppose the Ikeda Cabinet. After the rally, the students held demonstrations in front of the Diet and the Prime Minister's Official Residence.
    Xinhua News Agency, 14th dispatch: Tokyo News: Thirteen hundred workers and family members from the Miike Coal Mine held a rally in Omuta City today, resolutely opposing the massive layoffs by the capitalists.
    The capitalists of this large coal mine, belonging to the Mitsui zaibatsu, plan to lay off 1,200 union activists and workers. The Miike Coal Mine workers have been engaged in a long-term struggle, insisting on opposing this plan.
    Today, Kaoru Ota, Chairman of the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan (Sohyo), and leaders of the Japan Coal Miners' Union also attended the rally.
    After a heated discussion, the rally decided to continue the unified struggle until victory is achieved.
