Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin Dispatch: In the vigorous campaign to increase production and practice economy, the workers of Tianjin's steel enterprises have launched various forms of competition activities, which have rapidly increased the city's steel production and quality, and gradually reduced raw material consumption.

In this competition campaign, the four steel plants in Tianjin universally mobilized workers to formulate plans and measures, ensuring that there were examples to learn from, targets to aim for, groups paired for assistance, and everyone had a rival. There were not only paired competitions and rival competitions, but also key problem-solving competitions and demonstration competitions targeting weak links. Inter-factory competition contracts were also signed between the factories for the same types of work. In the competition, the Second Steel Plant established two clear "benchmarks" for all workers in the plant—the Yang Desheng Group and the Wang Wenhua Group. From January to August this year, the Yang Desheng Group produced more than 840 consecutive heats of steel in the converter without producing any scrap steel, and no accidents occurred. The qualified rate of steel produced by the Wang Wenhua Group has consistently remained above 99%. The factory Party committee mobilized workers and technicians to carefully summarize the experiences of these two groups, organized workers to learn from them, and quickly launched a competition upsurge across the factory to learn from, catch up with, and surpass the Yang Desheng and Wang Wenhua Groups. Many groups took the initiative to link up with the Yang Desheng and Wang Wenhua Groups, signed mutual teaching and learning contracts, and formulated learning, catching up, and surpassing plans. After learning the operating methods of the Yang Desheng Group, the Gao Wencai Group of Class C in the Second Branch eliminated low-temperature steel. The Yang Shouzhen Group of the Third Branch learned from the "collective steelmaking" experience of the Yang Desheng and Wang Wenhua Groups and continuously overfulfilled its production plans.

Whether it was intra-factory competition or inter-factory competition, the workers concentrated their efforts on tackling key production areas. The cupola furnace workers of the Fourth Steel Plant established and improved the post responsibility system and conscientiously implemented the technical operation policy of "high wind, high temperature, and alkalinity," increasing the lifespan of the cupola furnace from the original 70 to 80 heats to 200 to 300 heats, with a maximum of 430 heats. The First Steel Plant concentrated its efforts on transforming the cupola furnace equipment, meticulously building it, carefully maintaining it, and unifying the three-shift operation, extending the furnace lifespan by more than double.

In the competition, each steel plant carried out activities such as large-scale demonstrations, large-scale summaries, large-scale promotions, and the establishment of pacesetters, forming a competition upsurge among workers of chasing each other and striving for first place. Through technical demonstration competitions for various types of work, the Second Steel Plant summarized a total of 260 advanced experiences and established more than 380 pacesetters. Now these pacesetters have become learning and catching-up objects for each workshop and each type of work, and advanced experiences are being widely promoted throughout the plant, and the production level of many processes and groups has rapidly improved. The furnace bricklaying worker Wang Zhiyong Group created a record of laying a furnace in four hours in the technical demonstration competition. This experience was quickly summarized and has been widely promoted throughout the plant. The Sun Shihe Group learned from the experience of the Wang Zhiyong Group and created a new record of laying a furnace in three hours and twenty-five minutes. Subsequently, the Wang Zhigang Group absorbed the experience of these two groups and created the latest record of three hours. Through such chasing each other, many of the original advanced production levels of steel enterprises have quickly become general levels, improving the overall production by a step.

The competition for steel production increase by the workers of Tianjin's steel enterprises has received strong support from all walks of life in the city.

    学有对象　赶有目标　组组有对口　人人有对手
    天津各钢厂产量质量显著提高
    据新华社天津电　天津市钢铁企业职工在声势浩大的增产节约运动中，开展各种形式的竞赛活动，使全市钢的产量、质量迅速提高，原料消耗逐步降低。
    在这次竞赛运动中，天津市四个钢厂普遍发动职工制订了规划和措施，作到了学有对象，赶有目标，组组有对口，人人有对手，既有对口赛、对手赛，又有针对薄弱环节开展的攻关赛、表演赛。各厂之间还签订了厂际的同工种竞赛合同。第二钢厂在竞赛中给全厂工人树立了两个鲜明的“标杆”——杨德生小组和王文华小组。杨德生小组今年1至8月用转炉炼钢连续八百四十多炉不出废钢，并且没有发生过任何事故。王文华小组炼钢合格率一直保持在99％以上。厂党委会发动工人和技术人员认真总结了这两个小组的经验，组织工人学习，在全厂范围内很快掀起了一个学、赶、超杨德生和王文华小组的竞赛高潮。许多小组主动和杨德生、王文华小组挂钩，签订互教互学合同，订立学、赶、超规划。二分厂丙班高文采小组学习了杨德生小组的操作方法以后，消灭了低温钢。三分厂杨守贞小组学习了杨德生、王文华小组“集体炼钢”的经验，连续超额完成了生产计划。
    不论是厂内竞赛，还是厂际竞赛，职工们都集中力量围攻生产关键。第四钢厂化铁炉职工建立和健全了岗位责任制，认真贯彻“大风、高温、碱性”技术操作方针，使化铁炉炉龄由原来七十至八十炉提高到二百炉、三百炉，最高达到四百三十炉。第一钢厂集中力量改造化铁炉设备，并且细心砌造，精心维护，统一三班操作，使炉龄延长一倍多。
    在竞赛中，各钢厂都开展了大表演、大总结、大推广、大树标兵的活动，在职工中形成了一股你追我赶、力争第一的竞赛热潮。第二钢厂通过各工种技术表演赛，共总结出了二百六十项先进经验，树立了三百八十多名标兵。现在这些标兵已经成为各车间、各工种的学、赶对象，先进经验也正在全厂广泛推广，许多工序、小组的生产水平迅速提高。砌炉工人王志永小组在技术表演赛中，创造了四小时砌一个炉的纪录。这一经验迅速总结出来，并已在全厂推广。孙士和小组学习了王志永小组的经验，又创造了三小时二十五分砌一个炉的新纪录。随后，王志刚小组吸收了这两个小组的经验，又创造了三小时的最新纪录。经过这样的你追我赶，钢铁企业的许多原来先进的生产水平已经迅速变成一般水平，使整个生产提高了一步。
    天津市钢铁企业职工增产钢铁的竞赛，得到全市各行各业的大力支援。
