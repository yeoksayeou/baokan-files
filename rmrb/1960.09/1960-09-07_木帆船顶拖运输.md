    Wooden Sailboat Top-Towing Transportation
    In Jianli County, Hubei Province, top-towing transportation using wooden sailboats is being vigorously promoted. Currently, the county has formed 106 wooden sailboat top-towing teams, involving 400 sailboats. These fleets are organized into four formations: "fish biting tail" in a single line; a "dragon" tow; "swallow-style" formation; and multiple-row single-line formation.

    The main benefits of using the above formations to organize wooden sailboat top-towing for centralized departures are: it can increase sailing speed by 10% to 30%; it can generally increase cargo carrying capacity by about 40%; labor can be used in a concentrated manner, and after the fleet arrives at the port, the crew can be responsible for loading, unloading, and carrying, which can not only save loading and unloading manpower but also shorten the berthing time in port; it allows for planned organization of crew members in shifts, giving them more time and conditions for political and cultural learning.

    木帆船顶拖运输
    湖北省监利县大搞木帆船顶拖运输。现在全县已经组成木帆船顶拖队一百零六个，参加的木帆船达四百只。这些船队按队形的编制分为四种：鱼咬尾一列式；一条龙拖带；燕式队形和多排一列式。
    采用上述队形组织木帆船顶拖集中开航，主要好处是：可以提高航速百分之十到百分之三十；一般能增加货物载运量百分之四十左右；劳动力可以集中使用，船队到港之后船员可以自己负责装卸、搬运，既能节约装卸力量，又能缩短在港停泊时间；能有计划地组织船员轮班生产，使船员有较多的时间和条件进行政治、文化学习。
