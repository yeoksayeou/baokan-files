Xinhua News Agency. The Ministry of Agriculture and the Ministry of Commerce issued a joint notice on the 7th, requiring all localities to start early and fully prepare for autumn vegetable storage and processing. The notice stated that the situation of autumn vegetable production this year is very good. At present, several provinces and cities have overfulfilled the autumn vegetable sowing plan, some places are seizing the time to complete the sowing task, and the autumn vegetable sowing area in many places has greatly exceeded last year. At present, all localities should seize the opportunity, make full use of all available open spaces to strive to plant more autumn vegetables, and must earnestly arrange labor, timely cultivate and weed, water and fertilize, and pay special attention to preventing and controlling diseases and insect pests, and strive to increase the yield per unit area of autumn vegetables. At the same time, all localities must start early and fully prepare for all autumn vegetable storage and processing work. For this reason, the notice requires:

    1. Rural people's communes should take the canteen as the center, formulate storage and processing plans based on the planting of autumn vegetables, designate special personnel to be responsible, and prepare venues, materials, containers, etc. as soon as possible. All vegetables that can be stored and processed must be fully utilized; the vegetables planted by commune members must also be guaranteed to be harvested, stored, and processed in a timely manner.

    2. Urban industrial and mining areas should also formulate practical methods and necessary systems for autumn vegetable storage and processing, and fully mobilize social forces to dry vegetables, pickle vegetables, and store fresh vegetables. Larger catering units such as government agencies, organizations, schools, troops, factories, and mines should adopt a one-time arrangement for eating vegetables this winter and next spring, and try to achieve self-storage and self-consumption.

    People's communes in suburban areas of urban industrial and mining areas should store and manage commodity vegetables, self-supplied vegetables, and seed-retaining vegetables separately as much as possible, and establish a scientific management and strict responsibility system for taking and using them. The commercial departments should carefully accept the commodity vegetables stored by the people's communes on their behalf, and establish management methods. It is possible to adopt a one-time acceptance, formulate reasonable loss rates and necessary reward methods to be stored by the people's communes on their behalf, and pay a certain storage fee; or the people's communes can store them themselves, and the commercial departments can purchase them at reasonable seasonal price differences to ensure the benefits of the people's communes.

    3. Under the leadership of party and government leaders at all levels, the agricultural and commercial departments must adhere to putting politics in command, earnestly do a good job in organization, propaganda and mobilization, have special personnel responsible for supervising and inspecting the preparation and implementation of storage and processing, and formulate and correctly grasp the price policy of pricing according to quality as soon as possible.

    For new vegetable areas and units and residents without storage and processing experience, we should help them solve some specific problems as much as possible, especially use various methods to strengthen technical guidance and timely exchange experience. Commercial departments should also further strengthen their own storage and processing capabilities, continue to implement the policy of making do with simple means and running enterprises diligently and thriftily, and strive to do a good job in the supply and adjustment of materials necessary for storage and processing, so that this year's autumn vegetable storage and processing will be more and better, and ensure that it will be connected to the market of next year's spring vegetables.

    农业部商业部发出通知
    及早做好秋菜贮存准备工作
    新华社讯农业部、商业部7日发出联合通知，要求各地及早动手充分做好秋菜贮存加工准备工作。通知说，今年秋菜生产的形势很好。目前若干省、市都已超额完成秋菜播种计划，有些地方正在抓紧完成播种任务，许多地方的秋菜播种面积大大超过去年。当前，各地应该抓紧时机，充分利用一切可以利用的空地争取再多种一部分秋菜，并且要切实安排好劳动力，及时中耕除草，浇水施肥，特别要注意防治病虫害，努力提高秋菜单位面积产量。与此同时，各地都要及早动手，充分做好秋菜贮存加工的一切准备工作。为此，通知要求：
    一，农村人民公社以食堂为中心，根据种植秋菜情况，研究制订贮存加工计划，指定专人负责，及早准备好场地、物料、容器等。凡是可以贮存加工的菜要全部利用好；社员种植的蔬菜，也要保证及时收好、存好、加工好。
    二，城市工矿区对秋菜贮存加工也要订出切实可行的办法和必要的制度，要充分动员社会力量，大家动手晒干菜，腌咸菜，贮藏鲜菜。机关、团体、学校、部队、厂矿等较大的伙食单位，今冬明春的吃菜要采取一次安排，尽可能做到自贮自吃。
    城市工矿区郊区的人民公社要尽可能将商品菜、自食菜、留种菜分别贮存保管，并建立科学的管理和严格的取用等责任制度。商业部门委托人民公社代贮的商品菜要认真验收和建立管理办法。可以采取一次验收，制订合理的损耗率和必要的奖励办法交由人民公社代存，付给一定的保管费；或由人民公社自存，商业部门以合理的季节差价进行收购，以保证人民公社的收益。
    三，农业、商业部门必须在各级党政领导下，坚持政治挂帅，切实做好组织和宣传动员工作，要有专人负责督促检查贮存加工准备和落实情况，及早制订并正确掌握按质论价的价格政策。
    对新菜区和没有贮存加工经验的单位和居民，要尽可能帮助他们解决一些具体问题，特别要运用各种方法，加强技术指导工作和及时交流经验。商业部门还要进一步加强自己贮存加工力量，继续贯彻因陋就简，勤俭办企业的方针，努力做好贮存加工必需的物资供应调剂工作，使今年的秋菜贮存加工的又多，又好，保证接上明年春菜上市。
