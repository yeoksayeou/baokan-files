    (Reported by this newspaper) According to the Liaoning Daily, Li Wenge, the coal mining team leader of the Sixth Coal Mining Section of Fuxin Pingan Mine, has been going down the well and participating in labor every day since he became the team leader in 1956. He humbly learns from the masses, patiently helps the masses, and is good at giving full play to the enthusiasm of every worker in the team. The workers call him the "Red Flag Team Leader." The coal mining team he leads overfulfills the coal production plan every month. In just two and a half years from 1958 to the first half of this year, he has overproduced more than 40,000 tons of coal for the country, which is equivalent to completing three years and two months of workload, and saving 300 cubic meters of pit wood and a large amount of gunpowder, detonators, etc., becoming one of the advanced coal mining teams in the entire mine. After the Party Central Committee issued a call to carry out the campaign to increase production and practice economy, Li Wenge explained to the workers the great significance of increasing coal production to support Anshan Iron and Steel and the national production leap forward, and led the entire team to discuss and implement the production increase and economy plan for the next four months. Now, all the workers in the team are full of energy, and all work procedures have launched a "one-dragon" technical performance competition and a major battle to increase coal production in full swing. Since mid-August, their working conditions have been very poor - the roof pressure is high, but they produce more than 200 tons of coal every day, while in the past, under such conditions, they could only produce about 150 tons of coal per day.

    Familiar with Production Reality in Labor
    Communist Party member Li Wenge was promoted from a worker to a team leader. Although he was separated from production according to regulations, he knew that only by participating in production with the workers can he better connect with the masses, understand the reality and lead production well; only by setting an example in production can he better motivate all the workers in the team. Therefore, he not only goes down the well to participate in labor every day, but also often goes down the well before the workers and comes up the well later; when the workers arrive at the well, he has already inspected the five uphill roads, three disks, and various machines, and done a lot of production preparation work; after the handover time has passed, he is still at the work face helping the next shift create conditions for increased production.

    Li Wenge believes that to be a good leader, one must be familiar with production knowledge, know more than others, and do better. He took old workers as his teachers. In the process of participating in labor in the well, he asked them for advice when he encountered things he didn't understand. Because he learns humbly, studies hard, is clever, diligent, and quick, he has mastered all the operating techniques in the well, such as drilling and blasting, supporting pillars, maintaining electromechanical equipment, tunneling, and ventilation. Problems are often solved easily in his hands. When the key of the blasting machine didn't work well, he made one out of iron bars, which was both easy to use and exquisite; when the electric drill broke down, sometimes even electricians couldn't find the problem, but he fixed it with pliers in no time. The workers praised him, saying: "Our team leader is both civil and military, can go up and down, and is really our good leader!"

    Playing a Leading Role at the "Critical Moment"
    Li Wenge's leading role in production is prominently manifested in overcoming difficulties and promoting advanced experience, which he calls "taking the lead at the critical moment." First of all, he truly goes wherever there are difficulties, and never gives up until he overcomes them. In April last year, when the mine was in a high-yield campaign, his team was also very enthusiastic and wanted to create a new record in coal mining. However, the production conditions were very poor. The material transportation road was only half a meter high due to the strong roof pressure. The workers had to crawl to transport pit wood, and the air volume was small and the temperature was high. Even if they didn't work inside, they were sweating. The number of people transporting pit wood increased from three to seven, but they still couldn't meet the needs. Some people were reluctant to do it because they were afraid of getting dirty and tired. At this "critical moment," Li Wenge ran to transport pit wood without saying a word, specifically picking the big ones, taking the lead in crawling in the mud... He worked like this for more than twenty days, which greatly stimulated the enthusiasm of the material transport workers, and each person increased from transporting three or four roots per shift to sixteen or seventeen roots, which met the needs of coal mining. That month, they finally guaranteed that the entire section created a record of more than 16,000 tons of monthly output.

    At the beginning of this year, when their team was promoting the muck-loading machine, some people proposed: "Our wooden plank false roof palm (working face) has many sheds and dense tops, and the muck-loading machine can't turn around." They were unwilling to use it. Li Wenge improved the support method according to the characteristics of the wooden plank false roof working face and created an automatic hook to replace the original steel wire rope that pulled the muck-loading machine (the steel wire rope was not strong and easily broke). He and another worker operated a muck-loading machine, which was light and fast, and loaded more muck, which could top the amount of muck loaded by seven or eight people with large shovels. Seeing the actual superiority of the muck-loading machine, everyone scrambled to use the muck-loading machine. The whole team saved twenty-one shovel workers, and the amount of coal mining increased by 13%.

    Mobilizing the Enthusiasm of Everyone
    Based on the Party's education and personal experience, Li Wenge deeply understands that only by relying on the masses in everything, mobilizing all the workers in the team, and having everyone care about production and work hard for production with the attitude of a master can we promote continuous progress in production. Therefore, he consults with the workers on everything and never makes subjective decisions or gives compulsory orders. Every time a production plan is formulated, it is passed after full discussion at the team meeting; when problems are encountered in production, "Zhuge Liang meetings," palm meetings, and coordination meetings are held anytime and anywhere to mobilize everyone to contribute ideas and suggestions. Li Wenge is particularly good at fully mobilizing the enthusiasm of each worker in the team according to the characteristics of different workers. The first is to rely on old workers. Many old workers have a high class consciousness, a diligent and practical work attitude, and rich practical experience. Li Wenge formed such old workers into a "staff," and consulted them first when encountering things; let them be responsible for safe production and train new workers. New workers account for half of the total number of people in their team. Li Wenge studied with the old workers and adopted the method of contracting ideas, contracting technology, contracting safety, and contracting life to quickly help new workers master the technology and establish the idea of ​​"taking the mine as their home," making them a vital force in production. The characteristics of young workers are that they dare to think and act and accept new things relatively quickly. Li Wenge encouraged them to use new technologies and become promoters of advanced experience. Once, when promoting the advanced experience of multiple blasting at one time, some old workers would rather run two more trips than blast multiple times at one time, fearing that the roof would collapse; on the contrary, young worker Liu Jiefeng dared to blast multiple times. Li Wenge, on the one hand, let young workers such as Liu Jiefeng learn the operating procedures of multiple blasting at one time and take the lead in using this advanced experience, and on the other hand, organized support workers and drilling workers to take measures to ensure safety. As a result, while ensuring safety, the blasting efficiency was greatly improved, from one blast at a time in the past to more than ten blasts at a time, and up to more than thirty blasts.

    When the enthusiasm of the workers is fully mobilized, Li Wenge always keeps a clear head and pays attention to protecting the enthusiasm of the workers, especially focusing on safety, so as to avoid accidents that dampen the workers' enthusiasm for work. According to the underground production rules he has explored over the years, whenever the output rises steadily and the workers become more and more energetic, it is easy to overlook safety, and at the same time, problems such as the follow-up of the working face, mechanical failures, and poor quality of pillar specifications are also prone to occur. At this time, he frequently checks the roof and the quality of the pillar specifications, frequently reminds workers to pay attention to safety to avoid accidents; organizes workers to strengthen the maintenance and repair of machines such as coal chutes and pillar removal devices; and prepares new working faces before the old working faces are completed. By taking the second step while walking the first step, seeing potential problems when production is smooth, and carefully arranging production, we can reliably ensure the continuous leap forward in production.

    Be a Confidant of the Workers
    Li Wenge is not only a good leader and a good student of the workers, but also a confidant of the workers. He often visits the workers' homes, talks sincerely with everyone, and is familiar with the ideological situation, temperament, and family life of everyone in the team. Whenever someone has a problem, he always helps solve it with enthusiasm. When someone is sick, no matter how busy Li Wenge is with work, he will definitely visit his home or the hospital after work. There is a fourth-level worker in their team who felt that his level was low for a period of time and was not active enough in production. At first, Li Wenge's persuasion did not work, but later he often went to his home to visit him after work, and sometimes took his lover with him, like visiting relatives, enlightening and educating him through chatting about family affairs, and helping him solve his difficulties. The two got along like brothers. After Li Wenge's patient education, the worker realized his mistake and gradually became active in work, and last year he became a model worker with full attendance. Li Wenge cares for and helps the workers in every possible way, and the workers regard him as their most trusted and closest friend. Over the past few years, their entire team has always been united like one person, wholeheartedly striving for the leap forward in coal production.

    Due to Comrade Li Wenge's outstanding achievements and experience in leading the team's work, he has recently been promoted to deputy section chief of the Sixth Coal Mining Section. (Attached photo)

    坚持参加生产领导生产　发挥带头作用团结群众
    采煤班长李文阁领导有方
    他领导的采煤班月月超额完成计划，两年半完成了三年多的工作量
    本报讯　据辽宁日报消息：阜新平安矿第六采煤段采煤班长李文阁，从1956年当班长以来，天天下井，天天参加劳动，虚心向群众学习，耐心帮助群众，善于充分发挥全班每个工人的积极性，工人称他为“红旗班长”。他所领导的采煤班，月月超额完成煤炭生产计划，仅从1958年到今年上半年的两年半时间里，就为国家超额生产了四万多吨煤炭，等于完成了三年零两个月的工作量，并节约坑木三百立方米和大量火药、雷管等，成为全矿的先进采煤班之一。党中央发出关于开展增产节约运动的号召以后，李文阁便给工人们讲解增产煤炭支援鞍钢和全国生产跃进的重大意义，带领全班工人，把今后四个月的增产节约计划讨论落实。现在，全班工人个个干劲十足，所有工序都热火朝天地开展了“一条龙”技术表演赛和增产煤炭大战。从8月中旬以来，他们的工作面生产条件很不好——顶板压力大，但每天都出煤二百吨以上，而过去在这种条件下，每天只能出煤一百五十吨左右。
    在劳动中熟悉生产实际
    共产党员李文阁，由工人提拔当班长以后，虽然按规定是脱离生产，但他知道只有和工人一起参加生产，才能更好地联系群众，了解实际、领导好生产；在生产中以身作则起带头作用，才便于更好地把全班工人带动起来。因此，他不但天天下井参加劳动，而且常常比工人先下井、后上井；工人到井下时，他已经把五条上山道、三个片盘以及各种机械检查了一遍，作了许多生产准备工作；交班时间过了，他还在工作面帮助下一班创造增产条件。
    李文阁认为，当好带头人还必须熟悉生产知识，比别人懂得更多，干得更好才行。他拜老工人为师，在井下参加劳动过程中，遇到自己不懂的事情就向他们请教。由于他虚心学习，刻苦钻研，心灵手巧，眼勤腿快，已经熟练地掌握了打眼放炮、支柱、维修机电设备、掘进、通风等井下所有的操作技术，问题到他手里往往迎刃而解。放炮器的钥匙不好使，他就用铁棍做出一个来，又好使又精致；电钻出故障，有时电工都找不出毛病，他拿钳子三下五除二就给修理好了。工人称赞他道：“我们班长能文又能武，能上又能下，真是我们的好领导！”
    在“节骨眼”上起带头作用
    李文阁在生产中起带头作用，突出地表现在克服困难和推广先进经验方面，用他的话说，叫做“在节骨眼上带头”。首先，他真正作到了哪里有困难就到哪里去，不战胜困难不罢休。去年4月间矿里大闹高产运动，他们班的劲头也很大，想创造采煤新纪录。可是，生产条件很不好，材料运输道被强大的顶板压力压得只有半米来高，工人运坑木得爬行，而且风量小，温度高，在里面不干活也憋得直淌汗，运坑木的人由三名增加到七名，还是供不上需要。有的人又嫌脏怕累不愿意干，在这“节骨眼”，李文阁二话没说就跑去运坑木，专挑大的运，带头在黄泥汤子里爬，别人拉不动他帮着拉……。这样一连干了二十多天，大大激发了运料工人的干劲，每人每班由运三、四根增加到十六、七根，供上了采煤需要。那个月他们终于保证全段创造了月产一万六千多吨的最高纪录。
    今年初，他们班推广攉煤机，有人提出：“咱们木板假顶掌子（工作面），棚子多，顶子密，用攉煤机转不过身来。”不愿意使用。李文阁就根据木板假顶工作面的特点改进了支保方法，创造了自动钩子代替原来牵引攉煤机的钢丝绳（钢丝绳不结实，容易扯断）。他跟另外一个工人操纵一台攉煤机，又轻快，攉煤又多，能顶拿大铁锹的七、八个人的攉煤量。看到攉煤机的实际优越性，大家都争着用攉煤机了。全班节省了二十一名攉锹工，采煤量提高了13％。
    调动每个人的积极性
    根据党的教育，加上切身体验，李文阁深深懂得：只有处处依靠群众，把全班工人都发动起来，人人都以主人翁的态度关心生产，努力生产，才能推动生产不断跃进。因此，他有事就找工人商量，从不主观独断，强迫命令。每次制订生产计划，都召开班会充分讨论以后通过；生产中遇到问题，随时随地召开“诸葛亮会”、掌子头会、碰头会，发动大家献计献策。李文阁特别善于根据不同工人的特点，充分调动全班每个人的积极性。首先是依靠老工人。许多老工人阶级觉悟高，劳动态度勤恳踏实，实际经验丰富。李文阁把这样的老工人组成一个“参谋部”，遇事先找他们商量；让他们负责安全生产，培养新工人。他们班新工人占总人数的一半。李文阁跟老工人研究，采取包思想、包技术、包安全、包生活的办法，由老工人很快地帮助新工人掌握了技术，树立起“以矿为家”的思想，使之成为生产中的生力军。青年工人的特点是敢想敢干，接受新事物比较快。李文阁便鼓励他们使用新技术，当推广先进经验的促进派。有一次推广一次多放炮的先进经验，个别老工人宁肯多跑两趟腿，也不愿意一次多放炮，怕崩冒了顶板；相反，青年工人刘杰峰就敢多放炮。李文阁一面让刘杰峰等青年工人学习一次多放炮的操作规程，带头用好这项先进经验，一面组织支柱工、打眼工采取措施保证安全。结果在保证安全的情况下，大大提高了放炮效率，由过去一次放一个炮增加到一次放十个炮以上，最多放到三十多个炮。
    当工人的积极性充分调动起来的时候，李文阁又时刻保持头脑清醒，注意保护工人的积极性，特别是抓安全，以免发生事故挫伤工人的劳动热情。根据他多年来摸索出的井下生产规律，每当产量节节上升、工人越干越起劲的时候，便容易忽视安全，同时工作面接续跟不上、机械发生故障、支柱规格质量不好等情况也容易发生。这时，他便勤检查顶板和支柱规格质量，勤提醒工人注意安全，避免发生事故；组织工人加强对运煤溜子、撤柱器等机械的维护和修理；不等老工作面采完就把新工作面准备好。这样走第一步看第二步，生产顺利时看到潜伏的问题，慎密周到地安排生产，就可靠地保证了生产持续跃进。
      做工人的知心朋友
    李文阁不但是工人的好领导、好学生，还是工人的知心朋友。他经常到工人家串门，跟大家推诚谈心，对班里每个人的思想情况、脾气秉性、家庭生活都很熟悉。谁有了甚么问题，他总是满腔热忱地帮助解决。有的人病了，李文阁工作再忙，下班后也一定到他家或医院去看望。他们班里有个四级工，有个时期嫌自己级别低，生产不够积极。起初李文阁劝他也不起作用，后来下班后便常到他家串门，有时还领自己的爱人一起去，像串亲戚似地通过唠家常启发、教育他，他有困难就帮助他解决，两个人处得像亲兄弟一般。经过李文阁耐心地教育，这个工人认识到了自己的错误，在工作上逐渐积极起来，去年还成了全勤标兵。李文阁无微不至地关心和帮助工人，工人们也都把他看成最知心、最亲密的朋友。几年来他们全班总是团结得像一个人，一心一意为煤炭生产跃进而奋斗。
    由于李文阁同志在领导班的工作中有突出的成绩和经验，最近已被提拔为第六采煤段的副段长。（附图片）
