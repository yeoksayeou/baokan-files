    The No. 2 converter workshop of the Shanghai No. 3 Steel Plant, due to the cadres going to the most difficult places and working together with Party members and members of the Communist Youth League to do political and ideological work, fully mobilized the enthusiasm of all aspects, and finally broke through the technical barrier of the No. 1 iron melting furnace, turning an "old master furnace" into a "red banner furnace", ensuring high and high-quality steel production (see our newspaper report on August 20). The workers of the No. 1 converter workshop of the Shanghai No. 1 Steel Plant sent representatives to the No. 1 iron melting furnace of the No. 2 converter workshop of the Shanghai No. 3 Steel Plant six times to learn from their experience. The first four times, they only learned the appearance of the furnace and the technical operation, and the production still did not improve much. It was not until the fifth and sixth times that they seriously studied the experience of "politics to the furnace front" that they obtained the "true scripture" of high-yield and high-quality steelmaking (see our newspaper report on September 3). Thanks to the earnest study and promotion of the experience of the No. 2 converter workshop of the Shanghai No. 3 Steel Plant, by the beginning of September, half of the iron melting furnaces in Shanghai's steel plants had reached or approached the level of the No. 1 iron melting furnace of the No. 3 Steel Plant, and the melting rate of the remaining half of the furnaces had increased by more than three tons compared with the average level of the previous month (see today's report in our newspaper). These three things have repeatedly proved a truth pointed out by Comrade Mao Zedong: Ideological work and political work are always the soul and commander of all work. In carrying out the mass movement for increasing production and practicing economy with grain and steel as the center, whether it is to solve major technical problems or other specific business problems, we must adhere to the principle of proletarian politics in command, start from strengthening ideological work and political work, improving the ideological consciousness of cadres and the masses, and giving full play to their subjective initiative, in order to achieve twice the result with half the effort.
    People must have certain material and technical conditions when carrying out production activities. In any industry or trade, to increase production and practice economy, it is necessary to solve various technical and business problems, and to overcome various barriers. Taking the Shanghai No. 3 Steel Plant and the No. 1 Steel Plant as examples, if the desulfurization efficiency of the iron melting furnace is not improved, high-quality steel cannot be produced; if the iron water capacity of the iron melting furnace is not increased and the life of the iron melting furnace is not prolonged, it will not be possible to increase steel production. Desulfurization, increasing iron water capacity, prolonging furnace life, etc., are all specific technical problems that must be solved practically. If these specific technical problems are ignored, production cannot increase substantially. Therefore, the Party Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong have repeatedly called on the leading comrades of economic work, especially the leading comrades of enterprises, to go to the forefront of production and rely on the masses to solve specific problems one by one.
    The solution of all technical and business problems is inseparable from people. And people have thoughts and consciousness. All human actions are inevitably governed by certain ideologies and consciousness. Should we actively support new things, or stubbornly cling to old things? Is it a sense of ownership, or a sense of employment? Should we rely on the broad masses, or rely on a few people? Should we integrate with the masses, or stay high above? Is it down-to-earth and meticulous, or is it superficial? … All these different positions, viewpoints, methods and styles cannot but affect people's enthusiasm and people's subjective initiative. Countless facts have repeatedly proved that those who stand on the proletarian position, observe problems with the viewpoint and method of dialectical materialism, and have a down-to-earth and meticulous work style are always full of revolutionary vigor, can grasp the law of the development of objective things relatively quickly, and can give full play to their subjective initiative. They are not only good at giving play to the role of favorable conditions, but also good at turning unfavorable factors into favorable factors. Ideological work and political work are the commander. Of course, they cannot replace specific technical work and business work, but by stipulating and implementing correct political lines and policies, correctly handling contradictions among the people, and raising the socialist consciousness of the workers and masses, so that the masses are encouraged, it is certain that more grain, more steel, coal and other material resources can be produced under the same material and technical conditions. These are no longer abstract arguments, but have been repeatedly proved by countless facts since the Great Leap Forward.
    The movement to increase production and practice economy is deepening step by step, and ideological work and political work must also deepen step by step. The Party organizations of enterprises must constantly, through extensive airing of views, debates, big-character posters, individual talks, planting experimental fields, eating, living, laboring and consulting with the masses, combine the specific thoughts and understandings of cadres and the masses, constantly publicize the Party's line and policies, correctly handle contradictions among the people, improve the socialist consciousness of cadres and the masses, and give full play to the great subjective initiative hidden in cadres and the masses.
    In production and construction, if we only talk about business and technology and not about ideology and politics, we will lose our direction, become detached from the masses, and affect production. If we only talk about ideology and politics and do not grasp specific business and technology, the actual problems in production cannot be properly resolved, which will also affect the development of production. We must unify ideological and political work with business and technical work, and take ideological and political work as the soul and commander to guarantee and promote business and technical work. Therefore, after grasping ideological work and political work, we must ride the waves and seize the opportunity to solve various key technical problems and business problems in production, and seize the opportunity to implement various specific measures. From various rules and regulations to equipment maintenance, from production to life, from work to rest, we must grasp everything. In a word, we must not only start from ideological and political work, give full play to the subjective initiative of the workers and masses, but also promptly guide the workers' political enthusiasm to solving various specific technical and business problems. In this way, the movement to increase production and practice economy with grain and steel as the center can be further carried out both vigorously and down-to-earth.

### 思想政治工作必须先行

    思想政治工作必须先行
    上海第三钢铁厂二转炉车间，由于干部到最困难的地方去和党员团员一齐做政治思想工作，充分调动了各个方面的积极因素，终于突破了一号化铁炉的技术关，使一个“老爷炉”一变而为“红旗炉”，保证了钢的高产优质（见8月20日本报报道）。上海第一钢铁厂第一转炉车间职工，六次派代表去上钢三厂二转炉车间一号化铁炉取经，头四次由于只学习炉子的模样和技术操作，生产仍然没有多大起色，直到第五、第六次认真学习了“政治上炉前”的经验，才取得了高产优质的炼钢“真经”（见9月3日本报报道）。上海全市各钢铁厂由于认真学习和推广了上钢三厂二转炉车间的经验，到9月上旬止，已有半数化铁炉的熔化率接近或赶上了三厂一号化铁炉的水平，其余一半的炉子熔化率比上月平均水平提高三吨以上（见今天本报报道）。这三件事情，一再证明了毛泽东同志指出的一个真理：思想工作和政治工作永远是一切工作的灵魂和统帅。在开展以粮、钢为中心的增产节约全民运动中，解决重大的技术问题也罢，解决其他具体业务问题也罢，都必须坚持无产阶级的政治挂帅，从加强思想工作和政治工作，提高干部和群众的思想觉悟，发挥他们的主观能动性做起，才能事半功倍。
    人们在进行生产活动的时候，必须要有一定的物质技术条件。无论哪行哪业，要增产，要节约，都需要解决各种各样的技术问题和业务问题，都要过各种各样的关。拿上海第三钢铁厂、第一钢铁厂来讲，不提高化铁炉的去硫效率，就炼不出优质钢；不增加化铁炉的铁水容量，不延长化铁炉的炉龄，要提高钢产量也是不成的。去硫、增加铁水容量、延长炉龄等等，都是具体的技术问题，必须切切实实地加以解决。忽视了这些具体的技术问题，生产就不可能大幅度地上升。所以党中央和毛泽东同志一再号召经济工作的领导同志，特别是企业的领导同志，要到生产第一线去，依靠群众解决一个个的具体问题。
    一切技术问题、业务问题的解决，都离不了人。而人是有思想、有意识的。人的一切行动，无不受着一定的思想意识所支配。是积极支持新生事物，还是死抱住旧事物不放？是主人翁态度，还是雇佣态度？是依靠广大群众，还是依靠少数人？是和群众打成一片，还是高高在上？是踏实、细致，还是飘浮？……所有这些不同的立场、观点、方法和作风，都不能不影响着人们的干劲，不能不影响着人们的主观能动性。无数事实一再证明：那些站在无产阶级立场上、用辩证唯物主义的观点和方法观察问题，又有踏实的、细致的工作作风的人，总是革命干劲十足、能比较快地掌握客观事物的发展规律、能充分地发挥主观能动作用的人。他们不但善于发挥有利条件的作用，也善于变不利因素为有利因素。思想工作和政治工作是统帅，当然不能代替具体的技术工作和业务工作，但是规定和执行了正确的政治路线和方针，正确地处理了人民内部的矛盾，提高了职工群众的社会主义觉悟，使群众鼓起了干劲，就一定能够在同样的物质技术条件下，生产更多的粮食、更多的钢铁、煤和其他物质资料。这些，已不是什么抽象的论断，已经为大跃进以来许许多多的事实所一再证明了。
    增产节约运动正在一步一步地深入，思想工作和政治工作也要一步一步地深入。企业的党组织要不断地通过大鸣、大放、大辩论、贴大字报、个别谈心、种试验田、跟群众同吃同住同劳动同商量等，结合干部和群众的具体思想和认识，不断地宣传党的路线和政策，正确处理人民内部的矛盾，提高干部和群众的社会主义觉悟，把蕴藏于干部和群众中的伟大的主观能动作用充分发挥出来。
    在生产和建设中，只讲业务和技术，不讲思想和政治，就会迷失方向，脱离群众，影响生产。只讲思想和政治，不抓具体的业务和技术，生产中的实际问题得不到妥善解决，也会影响到生产的发展。我们要把思想、政治工作和业务、技术工作统一起来，以思想、政治工作为灵魂和统帅，保证和促进业务和技术工作。因此，在抓了思想工作和政治工作之后，必须乘风破浪，抓紧解决各种生产技术关键问题和业务问题，抓紧各种具体措施。从各种规章制度到设备维修，从生产到生活，从劳到逸，都要抓起来。一句话，我们既要从思想、政治工作入手，充分发挥职工群众的主观能动作用，又要及时地把职工的政治热情引导到解决各种具体的技术和业务问题。这样，就可以使以粮、钢为中心的增产节约运动，既轰轰烈烈、又踏踏实实地进一步开展起来。
