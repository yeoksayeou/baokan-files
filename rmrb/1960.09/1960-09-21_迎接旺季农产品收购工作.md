Welcoming the Peak Season of Agricultural Product Procurement

　　Now, early autumn crops are beginning to appear in many areas, and the harvest season for major autumn crops is approaching. Autumn is the main harvest season for agricultural products throughout the year, and it is also the most concentrated and busiest season for agricultural product procurement. Therefore, under the guidance of the policy of vigorously developing agriculture and grain, on the basis of seizing autumn field management and autumn harvesting, autumn plowing, and autumn planting work, in conjunction with arranging the lives of rural people, the autumn agricultural product procurement campaign should be launched in a timely manner, actively organizing the procurement of agricultural and sideline products centered on grain, cotton, and oil crops, and seizing the "small autumn harvest" and the processing and transportation of agricultural products. This is a very important task for the national agricultural departments, commercial departments, transportation departments, and rural people's communes.
    The great significance of doing a good job in agricultural product procurement is clear to everyone. It is related to the people's food and clothing, the arrangement of light industrial production, the supply of domestic markets and export goods, and the development of agriculture and heavy industry. We should also especially see that, since the Great Leap Forward, on the one hand, China's industry and various construction undertakings are continuing to leap forward better and more comprehensively, urban people's communes are developing steadily, and cities and industries are showing a thriving scene, thus greatly increasing the need for agricultural products. On the other hand, rural people's communes have been consolidated and continue to develop, the scale of agricultural production is expanding, and the income of commune members continues to grow. Therefore, the vast rural areas also demand to exchange more agricultural products for more means of production, more machinery, farm tools, fuel, chemical fertilizers, pesticides, and equipment, and more daily industrial products and other commodities that commune members need. These situations show that agricultural product procurement must closely follow the new situation of the rapid development of production and construction, and must resolutely continue to implement the policy of taking agriculture as the foundation and simultaneously developing industry and agriculture. Make these two major economic sectors promote and promote each other faster and better. We must do a good job in the current agricultural product procurement work, master the necessary grain, non-staple food, industrial raw materials and other agricultural and sideline products, in order to more powerfully guarantee the continued leap forward of the national economy in the future, more powerfully guarantee the consolidation and development of China's urban and rural people's communes, and more powerfully guarantee the implementation of the general line of socialist construction.
    Agricultural product procurement is an important aspect of agricultural product distribution. Since 1958, with the expansion of the scale of production and construction and the increase in the degree of collectivization, and with the establishment and consolidation of people's communes, the degree of collectivization of people's lives has also greatly increased. In the past, arranging life was done by each household, but now, to a large extent, the state and the collective must arrange life. Now, to distribute and use the self-sufficient grain and other agricultural products in rural areas well, the central issue is to arrange the people's lives well. Under this new situation, the state procurement work must be combined with the arrangement of the lives of rural people, and overall consideration must be given to appropriate arrangements. It is necessary to ensure that the state has enough agricultural products to guarantee the needs of high-speed socialist construction, and to ensure that the lives of rural people are properly arranged, so that the vast number of farmers can exert greater enthusiasm in production. How to combine and unify these two? It can be summarized into two sentences: Production should be full of energy, and distribution should leave room for maneuver. Production should be full of energy, that is, to increase the production of grain, cotton, oil crops and other agricultural and sideline products by every possible means, increase the production of melons, vegetables, pigs, poultry, fish and other non-staple foods. From the current point of view, it is to continue to seize autumn field management on the basis of achieving great victories in the fight against disasters, grow and manage late autumn crops well, and do a good job in preparing for autumn harvesting, autumn plowing, and autumn planting. Distribution should leave room for maneuver, that is, to use grain and other agricultural products in a planned and long-term manner. From the current point of view, it is to start from the overall situation and effectively arrange the necessary agricultural products in all aspects, so that the needs of the state, the collective, and the individual are appropriately met. In the work of agricultural product distribution, rural areas should think of cities, bumper harvest areas should think of disaster areas, and surplus grain areas should think of grain-deficient areas. Every place should think of the whole country, and everyone should regard supporting national construction and supporting other areas as their own glorious and unshirkable responsibility. At the same time, every region, every department, and every unit should not only display the style of hard work and simplicity and ensure the essential needs in the use of agricultural products, but also pay attention to long-term planning, leave room for maneuver, and appropriately increase reserves. This year should think of next year and the year after, and this month should think of the next few months. In this way, we can properly arrange the supply from cities to rural areas, from industry to agriculture, and from production to life, guarantee the necessities of all aspects, and increase the necessary reserves.
    How to do a good job in agricultural product procurement? The experience of previous years, especially the recent two years, proves that the key lies in the Party committee strengthening leadership and launching a mass movement. Agricultural product procurement is a complex and meticulous task. It is a major economic task and also a major political task. Therefore, without the full attention of Party committees at all levels, and without comprehensive ideological and organizational work under the unified leadership of the Party committee, the procurement movement cannot be carried out smoothly, and the procurement task cannot be guaranteed to be completed. At the same time, agricultural product procurement is also a widespread mass work. It is related to national construction and the lives of the broad masses. The harvesting, threshing, transporting, and selling of large quantities of agricultural products must mobilize and organize the broad masses to participate. Since the Great Leap Forward, our rural areas have been very busy in every season, and the various tasks in autumn are particularly intense. In order to procure agricultural products quickly and well, we must mobilize the masses and exert full energy to successfully complete the task. Therefore, agricultural product procurement must implement the mass line and launch a mass movement.
    In the agricultural product procurement movement, we must first adhere to putting politics in command and do thorough and meticulous ideological work. The autumn agricultural product procurement work in the past two years has been closely combined with the propaganda and education of the general line. Facts show that through the education of the general line, through the propaganda of the achievements of construction since the Great Leap Forward, and through the comparison of life now and in the past, the understanding and awareness of the broad masses can be further improved, the people can further see the future clearly, further clarify the political direction, and further realize the overall interests and the fundamental interests, thereby consciously combining the national interests and long-term interests with the personal immediate interests correctly. In this year's agricultural product procurement work, we should also, like in the past two years, vigorously publicize the victory of the three red flags of the general line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Commune, and publicize the policies and policies of procurement and distribution. As long as we explain the principles to the broad masses and do the ideological work thoroughly and deeply, the broad masses will warmly support and actively act, and we will be able to do the procurement work quickly and well on the basis of launching a mass movement.
    In the agricultural product procurement movement, we must also carry out cooperation between various regions and departments. Since autumn agricultural product procurement is a large-scale movement in which the vast rural areas support national construction and urban and rural areas support each other, it is by no means something that one department or one unit can complete alone. It must be carried out jointly by mobilizing the forces of various regions, departments, and units under the unified leadership of Party committees at all levels. In rural areas, commercial departments and transportation departments must be closely combined with agricultural departments, arrange labor, transportation, and related tools and equipment well, and closely combine procurement with the harvesting of crops, so that agricultural products are harvested, threshed, processed, and transported one after another, with each link tightly connected. Agricultural product procurement should also be combined with the diversified operations and comprehensive utilization of the vast rural areas. All domestic, wild, bulk, small, major, minor, plant, animal, mineral, and aquatic resources that can be utilized should be actively managed, collected and purchased by relying on the masses, and processed into finished or semi-finished products. We should strive to develop comprehensive utilization. This is also an important aspect of procurement work and should not be neglected. In addition to the cooperation between various departments and units in rural areas, we should further mobilize the strength of cities and industries to support rural areas. We must seize the current opportunity to produce and transfer more agricultural means of production and daily industrial products to supply rural areas. Daily industrial products that are needed by both urban and rural areas should be given priority to supply rural areas. We should organize some urban people to go to nearby rural areas to help harvest grain, vegetables, and other agricultural products according to possible conditions. We should appropriately organize technical forces to go to the countryside, and we should organize urban transportation forces as much as possible to assist in the transfer of agricultural products, especially those that are urgently needed or easily perishable (such as vegetables). This kind of support from cities to rural areas is not only of great economic significance, but also of great political significance. This work should be actively organized.
    In the procurement movement, leading organs and relevant departments at all levels must also do meticulous organizational and business work to ensure that the development of the movement is both vigorous and down-to-earth. Higher-level organs must earnestly strengthen specific leadership and conscientiously help the lower levels solve practical problems. Whether it is national procurement work or commune distribution work, we must conduct in-depth inspections unit by unit and implement specific matters one by one. In this way, we can ensure that the enthusiasm of the masses is better brought into play, ensure the healthy development of the movement, and also ensure that our economic work becomes more and more meticulous, so that all tasks can leap forward on a solid ground. Some places have checked and implemented the three things of procurement, distribution, and arrangement of life in each production team and each canteen one by one. This style is worth advocating and promoting.
    At present, the movement to increase production and practice economy centered on grain and steel is flourishing, the policy of taking agriculture as the foundation is being further implemented, the whole Party is grasping production with one hand and grasping life with the other, and attaching great importance to the issue of agricultural product procurement and arrangement of people's lives. This means that the situation is very good and there are many favorable conditions. As long as the agricultural departments, commercial departments, and transportation departments in various places, under the unified leadership of the Party committee, work harder with full confidence and in a down-to-earth manner, they will surely be able to successfully complete this year's autumn agricultural product procurement and distribution tasks.

　　迎接旺季农产品收购工作
    现在，许多地区的早秋作物开始登场，大秋作物的收获季节即将到来。秋季是一年之中农产品的主要收获季节，也是农产品收购最集中、最繁忙的季节。因此，在大办农业、大办粮食的方针指导下，在抓紧秋田管理和秋收、秋耕、秋种工作的基础上，结合安排好农村人民生活，把秋季农产品收购运动及时地开展起来，积极组织以粮食、棉花、油料为中心的农副产品采购工作，和抓紧“小秋收”以及农产品的加工、调运工作，是全国农业部门、商业部门、交通运输部门和农村人民公社当前的一项十分重要的任务。
    做好农产品收购工作的重大的意义是大家都明了的。它关系到人民的吃饭穿衣，关系到轻工业生产的安排，关系到国内市场和出口物资的供应，也关系到农业和重工业的发展。我们还特别应当看到，大跃进以来，一方面，我国工业和各项建设事业正在更好更全面地继续跃进，城市人民公社正在稳步发展，城市和工业都呈现出一片欣欣向荣的景象，因而对农产品的需要大大增长了。另一方面，农村人民公社已经巩固并且继续发展，农业生产的规模日益扩大，社员收入继续增长，因此，广大农村也要求通过出售更多的农产品，换取更多的生产资料，换取更多的机器、农具、燃料、化学肥料、农药和器材，换取社员必需的日用工业品和其他商品。这些情况说明，农产品收购工作必须紧紧跟上生产建设飞跃发展的新形势，必须坚决继续贯彻执行以农业为基础，实行工业和农业同时并举的方针。使这两个主要的经济部门更快更好地互相推动、互相促进。我们必须做好当前的农产品收购工作，掌握必要的粮食、副食品、工业原料和其它农副产品，以便更有力地保证今后国民经济的继续跃进，更有力地保证我国城乡人民公社的巩固和发展，更有力地保证社会主义建设总路线的贯彻执行。
    农产品收购是农产品分配的一个重要方面。1958年以来，随着生产建设规模的扩大和集体化程度的提高，随着人民公社的成立和巩固，人民生活集体化的程度也大大提高了。过去一家一户地安排生活，如今在很大程度上要由国家和集体来安排生活。现在，要把农村自给的粮食和其他农产品分配好、使用好，中心问题就是安排好人民生活。在这种新的情况下面，必须把国家收购工作和安排农村人民生活结合起来，统筹兼顾适当安排。既要做到国家掌握足够的农产品，以保证高速度建设社会主义的需要，又要切实安排好农村人民生活，使广大农民在生产上发挥更大的干劲。怎样把这两者结合起来、统一起来呢？可以概括成两句话：生产鼓足干劲，分配留有余地。生产鼓足干劲，就是千方百计地增产粮食、棉花、油料和其它农副产品，增产瓜、菜、猪、禽、鱼等副食品，从目前来说，就是在抗灾斗争取得了很大胜利的基础上，继续抓紧秋田管理，种好管好晚秋作物，做好秋收、秋耕、秋种准备工作。分配留有余地，就是有计划地细水长流地使用粮食，使用其他农产品；从目前来说，就是从全局出发，切实地安排各方面必需的农产品，使国家、集体、个人的需要都得到适当满足。在农产品分配工作中，农村要想到城市，丰收区要想到灾区，余粮区要想到缺粮区，每个地方都要想到全国，人人都要把支援国家建设、支援其他地区当作自己光荣的、义不容辞的责任。同时，每个地区、每个部门、每个单位对农产品的使用，既要发挥艰苦朴素的作风、保证必不可少的需要，又要注意长期打算、留有余地，适当增加储备。今年要想到明年后年，这个月要想到以后几个月。这样我们就能妥善地安排从城市到农村、从工业到农业、从生产到生活的供应，保证各方面的必需，并且可以增加必要的储备。
    怎样做好农产品收购工作呢？历年来，特别是最近两年的经验证明，关键在于党委加强领导，大搞群众运动。农产品收购是一项复杂的、细致的工作，它是一项重大的经济工作，也是一项重大的政治工作。因此，没有各级党委的充分重视，没有在党委统一领导下的全面的思想工作和组织工作，收购运动就不可能顺利开展，收购任务就不可能保证完成。同时，农产品收购又是一项广泛的群众工作。它既关系到国家建设，又关系到广大群众生活；大量的农产品的收获、打晒、运输、交售，都必须动员和组织广大群众参加。大跃进以来，我们农村中各个季节都很繁忙，秋季各项工作尤其紧张，为了又快又好地把农产品收购起来，更必须发动群众，鼓足干劲，才能顺利完成任务。因此，农产品收购必须贯彻群众路线，大搞群众运动。
    在农产品收购运动中，首先要坚持政治挂帅，做好深入细致的思想工作。过去两年的秋季农产品收购工作，都是和总路线的宣传教育紧密结合着进行的。事实说明，通过总路线的教育，通过大跃进以来建设成就的宣传，通过现在和过去生活的对比，广大群众的认识和觉悟就能够更加提高，人民就进一步看清前途，进一步明确政治方向，进一步认识到整体利益和根本利益的所在，从而自觉地把国家利益、长远利益同个人的眼前利益正确地结合起来。今年的农产品收购工作中，也应当像过去两年一样，大张旗鼓宣传总路线、大跃进和人民公社三面红旗的胜利，宣传收购和分配的方针政策。只要把道理向广大群众讲清楚，把思想工作做深做透，广大人民就会热烈拥护，积极行动，我们就能够在大搞群众运动的基础上把收购工作做得又快又好。
    在农产品收购运动中，还必须开展各地区、各部门之间的协作。秋季农产品收购，既然是广大农村支援国家建设和城乡相互支援的大规模运动，就决不是一个部门、一个单位所能单独完成的，必须在各级党委的统一领导下，发动各地区、各部门、各单位的力量共同进行。在农村中，商业部门、运输部门一定要同农业部门密切结合起来，把劳动力、运输力和有关的工具设备都安排好，把收购工作应当同农作物的收获密切结合起来，使农产品随收获、随打晒、随加工、随运送，一环接一环，环环都扣紧。农产品收购还应当同广大农村的多种经营、综合利用结合起来。一切家生的、野生的、大宗的、小宗的、主要的、次要的、植物的、动物的、矿物的、水产的，凡是能够利用的资源，都应当积极经营，都应当依靠群众采集起来和收购起来，都应当加工为成品或半成品，尽量开展综合利用，这也是收购工作中的一个重要方面，切不可忽视。除了农村中各部门、各单位之间的协作以外，还应当进一步动员城市和工业的力量支援农村。要抓紧当前时机，生产和调运更多的农业生产资料和日用工业品去供应农村。凡是城乡都需用的日用工业品，应当优先供应农村。要根据可能条件，组织一部分城市人民去附近农村，帮助收获粮食、收获蔬菜、收获其他农产品；要适当组织技术力量下乡，要尽可能组织城市运输力，协助调运农产品，特别是那些急需的或容易腐坏的（如蔬菜）商品。城市对农村的这种支援，不仅有经济上的重要意义，也有很重要的政治意义。应当把这项工作积极组织好。
    在收购运动中，各级领导机关和有关部门还必须做好细致的组织工作和业务工作，保证运动的发展既轰轰烈烈又踏踏实实。上级机关要切实加强具体领导，认真帮助下面解决实际问题。不论是国家收购工作或是公社分配工作，都必须一个一个单位深入检查，一桩一桩事情具体落实。这样，才能保证群众的热情得到更好的发挥，保证运动的健康发展，也才能保证我们的经济工作愈做愈细致，使各项工作脚踏实地地向前跃进。有些地方把每个生产队、每个食堂的收购、分配、安排生活三件事，逐个检查，逐个落实。这种作风是值得提倡和发扬的。
    目前以粮、钢为中心的增产节约运动正在蓬勃开展，以农业为基础的方针正在进一步贯彻，全党一手抓生产，一手抓生活，十分重视农产品收购和安排人民生活的问题。这就是说，形势很好，有利的条件很多，只要各地农业部门、商业部门和交通运输部门在党委统一领导下，满怀信心地、切切实实地把工作做得更好，就一定能胜利地完成今年秋季农产品收购和分配任务。
