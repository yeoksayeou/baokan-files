The North Mengzhuang Brigade Works Hard on Grain Production
Liu Wenhe, First Secretary of the Shuangmiao Commune Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, Jiahe County, Hebei

　　Everyone says that the crops of the North Mengzhuang Production Team are particularly good. I went there to take a look, and they were indeed “worthy of the name.” To be honest, I have never seen such good crops. When I say good, I don't mean just ten or eight mu, but every plot is good, every plant is good.

　　“The scene evokes feelings.” The original poverty-stricken face of North Mengzhuang flashed through my mind like a movie, scene by scene. Is the good growth of the crops in this team due to “favorable weather and geographical advantages”? No. In terms of "weather," it was drought first and then flood, with wind, weeds, insects, and disasters... a hundred harms attacked; in terms of "geographical advantages," most of the land was low-lying, alkaline, thin, and barren. Of the team's more than 3,200 mu of land, 2,000 mu were "drought if there is no rain, flooding if there is rain, disaster if a toad urinates, and requiring a hoe to dig after three days of sun." The remaining 1,200 mu were not fertile fields either, but thin alkaline sandy depressions. This was the root of poverty.

　　Poverty is not a bad thing for revolution. Chairman Mao said, "Poverty gives rise to the desire for change, to work, to revolution." Facts have proved that poverty has become a driving force for the people of North Mengzhuang. They want to change, to work, to make revolution. The practice of the Great Leap Forward gave them experience, gave them courage, and made them understand the revolutionary principle that "it is up to man to conquer nature." They felt they had the strength to split mountains and fill seas, vowing to smash difficulties, pull out the roots of poverty, and plant the roots of wealth. I remember that in the spring of this year, under the leadership of the Party branch, the masses of North Mengzhuang launched a great storm of farmland revolution. More than two hundred male and female commune members of the whole team, wielding pickaxes, hoes, plows, and carts all together, through arduous labor, leveled and consolidated the more than 2,800 mu of uneven and scattered farmland, taking from the high to fill the low, and taking from the ridges to fill the gullies, turning them into new square fields that were level, with straight ridges, and boundless. The alkaline land in Xiliwa, a piece of more than 400 mu overgrown with red vitex, was originally planned to be excluded. When the old poor peasant Mi Shuquan learned about this, he went to the branch and the captain and said, "Are we going to be scared by this piece of alkaline land?..." The Party branch immediately studied the old poor peasant's opinion and, after discussion among the masses, everyone agreed. The commune members did what they said, achieving immediate results, digging up the red vitex while shouting: Dig up the roots of poverty and plant the roots of wealth. They shoveled away the alkaline soil and spread a layer of stinky manure. The commune members also felt that the manure was not enough, so they built pigsties, sheepfolds, and cattle pens there, implementing "three enclosures to the square fields."

　　They had just revolutionized the land and had to fight against natural disasters. The drought demon was pressing, and sandstorms filled the sky. Although the new square fields had been raked and rolled so carefully, they still lost moisture. The bottom of the pond cracked, and the water bucket hit the bottom of the well. The seasons wait for no one; it was time to sow, to sow in a timely manner. What to do if the land was dry and there was no water? The commune members were frantic and launched a surprise campaign against drought. Finding water underground where there was none on the surface, they dug a large brick well with a mouth diameter of two zhang and two chi, ensuring irrigation for an area of one thousand mu. After digging one well, they dug another, digging five in one go. Five water pumps and five silver dragons rushed to the square fields. The seeds of harvest were still sown in the moist soil in a timely manner.

　　After the seedlings drank their fill of jade-like nectar, they grew vigorously, changing day by day. The commune members were just about to take a breath when unexpected torrential rains poured down one after another, with 300 millimeters falling in one night. Thus, with the sound of the gong, more than two hundred men, women, and children of the whole team braved the rain and rushed to the new square fields, digging ditches and canals, and launching a battle to drain the flood. After two days of work, there were still patches of standing water in the fields. The commune members installed machines and used basins and pots to empty them completely.

　　The Party branch of the North Mengzhuang Production Team concentrated 82% of its strong labor force into the grain production front, overcame the drought, overcame the flood, eliminated the third-class seedlings, and then eliminated the weed infestation and insect pests. Under the slogan of "Do not relax management until the crops are in the barn," they persisted in later-stage management. In this way, the grain crops in North Mengzhuang grew very well, and it looked like a great harvest was in sight.

　　大办粮食的北孟庄
　　中共河北交河县双庙公社委员会第一书记　刘文和
    都说北孟庄生产队的庄稼特别好，我到那里看了看，果然“名不虚传”。说实在话，我还从没有见到过这样的好庄稼。说它好，不是指的十亩八亩，而是块块都好，棵棵都好。
      “触景生情”，北孟庄原来的穷面貌，像电影一样，一幕一幕在我脑子里闪过。这队的庄稼长得这样好，是“天时地利”吗？不是。论“天时”，是先旱后涝，风、草、虫、灾……百害袭击；论“地利”，大部土地，洼碱薄瘦。全队三千二百多亩地，有二千亩是“无雨就旱，有雨就涝，蛤蟆尿尿就成灾，晒上三天用镐刨”。那一千二百多亩，也不是良田肥土，而是薄碱沙洼。这就是穷根子。
    穷，对革命来说并不是坏事。毛主席说：“穷则思变，要干，要革命。”事实证明，穷，在北孟庄的人民面前变成动力，他们要变，要干，要革命，大跃进的实践，给了他们经验，给了他们胆量，更使他们懂得了“事在人为”的革命道理。他们觉得浑身有劈山填海之力，发誓砸碎困难，拔掉穷根，扎富根。记得今年春天，北孟庄的群众在党支部的领导下，来了一场农田革命大风暴。全队二百多名男女社员，抡起铣、镐，犁耙、车辆一齐上，经过艰苦的劳动，把二千八百多亩高低不平，地块零散的农田，进行了大平整，大连片，取高垫低，取楞补壑，变成了地平埂直，一望无际的新方田。西李洼那片四百多亩长满红荆的碱巴地，原打算划在方外。这件事，让老贫农米树全知道了，他找了支部找队长说：“就叫这片碱地吓住了吗？……”党支部立刻研究了老贫农的意见，拿到群众中一酝酿，群众都赞成。社员们说一不二，立竿见影，刨掉了红荆，边刨边喊：刨穷根，扎富根。铲了碱巴土，铺上一层臭坑泥。社员们还嫌粪不足，又把猪圈、羊圈、牛圈建在那里，实行了“三圈到方田”。
    他们刚刚革了大地的命，又得同天灾斗争。旱魔逼人，风沙漫天，新方田尽管耙轧得那么细致，也跑墒了。塘底裂了缝，井底碰得水桶响，节气不饶人，要播种，要适时播种，地旱无水怎么办？社员们急红了眼，展开了突击抗旱。地上无水地下找，他们打了一眼井口直径两丈二的大砖井，保浇面积一千亩。打成一眼又打一眼，一口气打成了五眼，五台抽水机，五条银龙冲向方田。丰收的种子还是适时地撒到了湿润的地里。
    小苗饱饮玉浆之后，茁壮地成长起来，一天一个样。社员们刚要喘口气，不料暴雨又接二连三泻下来，一夜就下了三百毫米。于是，大锣一响，全队男女老少二百多人，冒雨涌向新方田，挑沟挖渠，展开了排涝大战。经过两天的劳动，地里剩下一片一片的积水，社员们安上了机器，并且用盆盆罐罐把它掏了个一干二净。
    北孟庄生产队党支部，集中了82％的强壮劳力，投入了粮食生产战线，战胜了旱灾，战胜了涝灾，消灭了三类苗，接着又消灭了草荒、虫灾，并在“庄稼不登场，管理不放手”的口号下，坚持了后期管理，就这样，北孟庄的粮食作物生长得很好，眼看着就是一场大丰收。
