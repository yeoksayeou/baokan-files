　　Rich Xilin Gol

    Xilin Gol League is located in the central part of Inner Mongolia, with an elevation of between 1,000 and 1,200 meters. It is the largest natural grassland pasture on the plateau in the autonomous region. The league has nine banners, two counties, and two directly affiliated hot (towns), with a population of more than 500,000. The residents are mainly Mongolian and Han, as well as other fraternal ethnic groups such as Dawoer, Tibetan, and Hui. The league covers an area of ​​more than 230,000 square kilometers, of which 80% is pastoral area. The Ji-Er line of the railway connecting Beijing-Ulaanbaatar-Moscow runs through the western part of the grassland. The Ulagai, Baiyin and other rivers nourish the pasture. Lake Ejinor, known as the "Mother Lake", is rich in salt. Other mineral deposits such as coal and iron are also abundant.

    The Xilin Gol grassland has fertile land and lush water and grass. The league has a total of 6.1 million head of livestock, a net increase of 2.5 times compared with 1949, and now each herdsman has an average of 60 head of livestock. In the past ten years, herdsmen of all ethnic groups have supported the country with more than 4 million head of draft animals and edible cattle and sheep. Except for the two counties and parts of the four southern banners that engage in agriculture, the five northern banners were formerly pure pastoral areas. Grain and feed were entirely dependent on long-distance transportation from other places. This year, agriculture has been vigorously developed, and the sown area of ​​grain and feed has reached 1.63 million mu, an increase of 4.6 times over last year, realizing self-sufficiency in grain and feed.

    Before liberation, Xilin Gol had no industry. Now more than 150 factories and mines, such as power generation, machinery, coal, dairy products, and leather, have been established on the grassland. There are more than 3,000 small-scale industrial units run by the communes. Cultural and health undertakings have also developed greatly. After the vigorous development of agriculture in pastoral areas, this vast grassland will become more prosperous and beautiful. (Mijid Daoerji)

　　富饶的锡林郭勒
    锡林郭勒盟位于内蒙古中部，拔海在一千到一千二百米之间，是自治区最大的高原天然牧场。全盟九个旗、两个县、两个直属浩特（市镇），人口五十多万，居民以蒙古族和汉族为主，还有达斡尔、藏、回等兄弟民族。全盟面积二十三万多平方公里，其中80％为牧区。连接北京—乌兰巴托—莫斯科的铁路集（宁）二（连）线，纵贯草原西部。乌拉盖、白音等河流滋润着牧场，被称为“母亲之湖”的额吉诺尔湖，蕴藏着丰富的食盐。其他煤铁等矿藏也都很丰富。
    锡林郭勒草原土地肥沃，水草丰美。全盟有大小牲畜六百一十万头，比1949年净增二点五倍，现在平均每个牧民有六十头牲畜。过去十年间，各族牧民支援了国家耕畜和食用牛羊四百万头以上。全盟除两个县和南部四旗部分地区经营农业外，北部五旗，以前为纯牧业区，粮食饲料全靠从外地远途运输供应，今年大办了农业，粮食饲料播种面积达一百六十三万亩，比去年增长四点六倍，实现了粮食饲料自给自足。
    解放前，锡林郭勒的工业是一片空白。现在草原上已经建立了发电、机械、煤炭、乳品、皮革等厂矿一百五十多个。社办小型工业单位有三千多个。文化卫生事业都有很大发展。牧区大办农业以后，这个辽阔的草原将变得更繁荣、更美丽。（密吉德道尔基）
