　　Cadres Care for the Masses; The Masses Love Cadres; Jinggangshan People Work Together to Build Mountainous Areas
　　(Our Report) The cadres and masses of Jinggangshan in Jiangxi Province – the cradle of the revolution – have maintained and carried forward the fine traditions of the old revolutionary base. Cadres care for the masses, the masses cherish the cadres, and the relationship between cadres and masses is close and seamless. They join hands to build their homeland.
　　The more than 600 cadres in Jinggangshan have always worked hard, burying themselves in hard work, adhering to eating, living, laboring, and consulting with the masses, changing the face of the mountainous area. Jinggangshan has high mountains and cold water, strong winds and heavy fog, and the soil is barren, resulting in very low grain yields. Cadres have demonstrated tenacious drive in leading the masses to change natural conditions. Before 1957, double-cropping rice had never been planted in Jinggangshan. Zou Guizhang, the secretary of the Jinggangshan Township Party Committee, first experimented with planting double-cropping rice on the mountain. In 1958, he and commune members Zou Wenyao and Zou Wenkai planted more than two mu of double-cropping rice experimental fields on the mountain. In order to make the early rice mature early, in the freezing cold of the first month of the lunar year, he also worked barefoot with the commune members to level the land, apply base fertilizer, and sow seeds. After sowing, they encountered frost. He and the commune members built grass sheds by the fields, slept by the fields, and lived by the fields. They built stoves in the fields and burned hot water to irrigate the fields, overcoming the frost. As a result, the early rice matured early and yielded a high harvest, and the late rice was also planted in a timely manner. Zou Guizhang and the commune members successfully trial-planted double-cropping rice, setting an example for the large-scale planting of double-cropping rice in Jinggangshan. In recent years, double-cropping rice in Jinggangshan has grown from nothing to more than 65,000 mu this year. The rich Jinggangshan is full of precious wild plants. In developing this treasure mountain, Gu Ke Ren, the first secretary of the Administration Bureau Party Committee, and Secretary Lin Shi led the masses to traverse high mountains and steep ridges, investigate the resources hidden in the deep mountains, and found dozens of usable raw materials. Now, more than 30 factories and mines, including forestry, chemical industry, and iron factories, have been established here. In order to change the situation of the Jinggangshan people using pine branches and bamboo strips as oil lamps for thousands of years, Zhang Jingu, the secretary of the general Party branch of the Engineering Department of the Administration Bureau, led dozens of transferred cadres to overcome numerous difficulties and build hydropower stations, bringing electricity to this old revolutionary base for the first time.
　　The spirit of hard work, plain living, and burying themselves in hard work of the cadres in Jinggangshan has deeply moved the masses. They are more concerned, considerate, and loving towards the cadres. A new atmosphere of "four helps" has emerged. First, they actively help cadres understand the situation, making the cadres' ears and eyes more sensitive, mastering more information, and proposing more accurate methods. Second, they help cadres discover problems, so that problems in their work can be solved in a timely manner as soon as they appear. Third, many old Red Guards and activists volunteered to be propagandists, helping cadres carry out propaganda and mobilization work, so that the Party's policies can be implemented among the masses in a timely manner. Fourth, they help cadres learn production technology knowledge, adding to the cadres' ability to guide production. In addition, the masses also care for and care for the cadres in every possible way in production and life. When working, they compete with the cadres for heavy work and give them light work. In life, they compete with the cadres for hardship and give them enjoyment. Many old women in Dongshang and Nanshan Communes care for the cadres like their own children, vying to wash their clothes. Comrade Cai Quanhui, the first secretary of the Xincheng Commune Party Committee, fell ill in the Huangxia Brigade once, and the masses ran several miles in the dark to invite a doctor to treat him.
　　The example of the cadres inspires the masses, and the example of the masses also inspires the cadres. At present, more than 600 cadres in Jinggangshan are all deeply involved in the front line, working together in the fields and eating at the same table in the canteen, striving for a bumper harvest in autumn.

　　干部关怀群众　群众热爱干部
　　井冈山人民同心协力建设山区
    本报讯　革命摇篮——江西井冈山的干部和群众，保持并发扬了老革命根据地的优良传统，干部关心群众，群众爱护干部，干群关系亲密无间，携手共建家园。
    井冈山的六百多名干部，一直艰苦奋斗，埋头苦干，坚持和群众同吃，同住，同劳动，同商量，改变着山区面貌。井冈山上山高水冷，风大雾多，土质贫瘠，粮食产量很低。干部在领导群众改变自然条件中，发挥了顽强的干劲。1957年以前，井冈山上没有种过双季稻，井冈山乡党委书记邹桂章首先在山上试验种双季稻。1958年，他和社员邹文耀、邹文楷在山上种了两亩多双季稻试验田。为了使早稻提前成熟，在天寒地冻的正月，他还打着赤脚，和社员一起整地、施基肥、播种。播种后，正逢霜冻来临，他又和社员们在田边搭起草棚，睡在田边，住在田边；在田地搭起锅灶，烧热水灌田，战胜了霜冻。结果，早稻熟得早，收得多，晚稻也种得及时。邹桂章和社员试种双季稻成功，为井冈山大量种双季稻树立了榜样。几年来，井冈山上的双季稻从无到有，一直发展到今年的六万五千多亩。富饶的井冈山上，遍地皆是珍贵的野生植物。在开发这座万宝山中，管理局党委第一书记古克仁和书记林史，带领群众踏遍高山峻岭，调查深山蕴藏的资源，找出了几十种可以利用的原料。现在，这里已办起了林业、化工和铁厂等三十多个厂矿。为了改变井冈山人民千百年来的松枝、竹片当油灯的情况，管理局工程处党总支书记张金贵，领导几十个下放干部，克服重重困难，修建水电站。使这个老根据地第一次有了电灯。
    井冈山干部艰苦朴素、埋头苦干的精神，使群众深受感动，他们更加关心、体贴、热爱干部，出现了“四帮”的新风尚。第一，积极帮助干部了解情况，使干部的耳目更灵，掌握的情况更多，提出的办法更准。第二，帮助干部发现问题，使工作中的问题一露头，就能及时得到解决。第三，许多老赤卫队员和积极分子，自告奋勇当宣传员，帮助干部进行宣传鼓动工作，使党的方针政策，能够及时地贯彻到群众中去。第四，帮助干部学习生产技术知识，给干部增添了指导生产的本领。另外，在生产和生活上，群众还无微不至地体贴和关怀干部。在劳动时，他们与干部争重活、让轻活，在生活上，他们则与干部争艰苦、让享受。东上、拿山等公社的许多老大娘，都像关心自己的儿女一样关心干部，争着给干部洗衣服。新城公社党委第一书记财全辉同志，有一次在黄下大队生了病，群众摸黑跑几里路请医生给他治病。
    干部的榜样激励着群众，群众的榜样也激励着干部。目前，井冈山的六百多名干部都深入第一线，田间共同劳动，食堂同桌就餐，力争秋季大丰收。
