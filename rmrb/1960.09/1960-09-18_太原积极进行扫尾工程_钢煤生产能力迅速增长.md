Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan - Workers in the Taiyuan City basic construction system are actively carrying out finishing work. From July to now, the completed construction area in the city has exceeded the total completed area in the first half of the year by 17%, thereby rapidly increasing the production capacity of major products such as steel, iron, steel materials, and coal.

Many construction projects in Taiyuan City in the past are to be completed this year. To ensure the early completion and commissioning of these construction projects, the Taiyuan Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China concentrated most of the local building materials, transportation capacity, and a large number of construction and installation workers, and invested them in the finishing work of key construction projects; and launched a competition among basic construction workers throughout the city, focusing on key construction projects, to complete the finishing touches.

During the competition, more than 70% of the leading cadres of various construction units went deep into the front line to arrange the material supply and delivery dates for specific construction projects. Leading cadres of the Fourth Construction Engineering Company of Shanxi Province took the lead and formed a finishing assault team of more than 1,200 people. According to the construction scope of the finishing project, they determined the material consumption and quality, and then the teams and groups conducted on-site surveys and proposed specific construction organization measures, ensuring that each matter had a dedicated person, each person had a specific responsibility, and that there was analysis every ten days and inspection every day. In the past two months, they have completed fourteen completed projects and cleared seventy-two finishing projects. The area of finishing projects completed in the past two months has doubled compared with the second quarter.

In order to ensure the rapid completion of finishing projects, many units in the city have widely adjusted materials according to the needs of key construction projects. They opened warehouses, organized cooperation, and adjusted more than 4,000 tons of various steel materials, 114 cubic meters of wood, and more than 500 tons of cement, as well as many other motor equipment, bearings, electrical appliances, water glue and other equipment and components. This batch of materials was given priority to meet the needs of key basic construction projects.

    太原积极进行扫尾工程  钢煤生产能力迅速增长
    新华社太原电　太原市基本建设系统职工积极进行扫尾工程。从7月份到现在，全市已经完成的工程竣工面积比上半年竣工面积的总和还多17％，从而使钢、铁、钢材、煤等主要产品的生产能力得到迅速增长。
    太原市很多过去建设的项目都要在今年竣工。为了保证这批建设项目提前完工投入生产，中共太原市委集中了大部分地方建筑材料、运输力和大批建筑安装工人，投入了重点建设项目的结尾工程；并且发动全市基本建设职工以重点建设项目为主，开展了工程结尾的竞赛。
    竞赛中，各建筑单位70％以上的领导干部都深入了第一线，对具体施工项目的材料供应、交工日期作了安排。山西省第四建筑工程公司领导干部挂帅，组成了一千二百多人的收尾突击队，根据结尾工程的施工范围，确定了材料用量、质量，再由队、组实地勘察，提出具体施工组织措施，作到了事有专人，人有专责，一旬一分析，一天一检查，在最近两个月中，他们就完成了十四个竣工项目，扫清了七十二项结尾工程。两个月来完成的结尾工程面积，比第二季度增加了一倍。
    为了保证结尾工程迅速竣工，全市许多单位根据重点建设工程的需要，广泛地调剂了物资。他们打开仓库，组织协作，共调剂出各种钢材四千多吨，木材一百一十四立方米，水泥五百多吨；以及其他许多电机设备、轴承、电气、水胶等设备和部件，这批物资都尽先供给了重点基本建设工程的需要。
