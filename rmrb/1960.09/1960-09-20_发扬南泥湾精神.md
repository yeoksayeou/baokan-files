	Promote the Nanniwan Spirit
		By Our Correspondent Sun Shikai
	It was a lucky coincidence that just as I was thinking of going to the Central State Organs Afforestation and Production Base in Tailing, a car from the headquarters there arrived, and it was returning that same day. "Come with us!" With such a warm invitation from the comrades at the headquarters, we quickly set off.
	The car sped along Changping Avenue, and in less than two hours, we entered the lush forests of the Tailing mountain area. The comrades from the headquarters pointed ahead excitedly and introduced that more than twenty ministries and commissions of the central state organs often dispatch more than a thousand cadres to this mountainous area, mainly for afforestation and greening, and to develop diversified operations. Although it has only been two years, it has already begun to change the face of this barren mountain wilderness.
	To the north and northwest of Tailing, there are three large gullies, with lush greenery covering the mountains and fields. On these more than 34,000 mu of land, three million young trees of oil pine, cypress, and locust have been planted, and many apple orchards, grape valleys, and chicken-crowing ridges have appeared. On the newly reclaimed terraces, sturdy corn, millet, and buckwheat are growing... Sheepfolds, pigsties, chicken coops, and rabbit hutches built along the mountains are hidden in the greenery.
	It is now the autumn harvest season, and people are discussing with great interest the methods and measures to strive for a bumper autumn harvest. The narrow paths where the villagers used to drive their donkeys two years ago have now been paved into flat roads. These days, more cars are coming from Beijing than usual, bringing batches of cadres to support the "Three Autumns" work.
	In this area, everyone praises the crops grown by the afforestation production team of the Ministry of Agriculture as being particularly outstanding. When we went to visit, they were harvesting corn. Team leader Zhao Huayi picked up three large cobs, each more than eight inches long, and said with a smile: "Our production plan for this year, aiming for a yield of 1,000 jin per mu, seems to be conservative. We didn't expect the mountain land to have such great potential. An experimental plot of corn planted under the trees on stony ground actually yielded 1,350 jin per mu. The Eight-Character Charter can really turn the land upside down." At this moment, a young man covered in mud, put down his sickle, and said: "It was really not easy for us intellectuals who couldn't distinguish between the five grains to achieve such a bumper harvest. Under the call of the Party, we promoted the revolutionary spirit of Nanniwan, and we overcame the ‘three disasters,’ resisting drought until the sky bowed its head, if the sky didn't rain, we made it rain, resisting weeds until no weeds grew, pulling out every last one; resisting insects until they were all dead, spraying pesticides more than twenty times in a row..." Relying on this indomitable revolutionary perseverance, they planted more than 49 mu of crops from the river滩 to the hillside, adopting methods such as intercropping between trees and grain, and intercropping grain and vegetables, planting three crops of grain and vegetables on one piece of land. Now, the 60,000 large radishes planted on the terraces are growing lush and green.
	The villagers here have never had the habit of growing vegetables, believing that the high mountains, dry climate, and poor soil are not suitable for growing vegetables. Two months ago, the cadres of the central state organs responded to the call of the Party and cleared the thick turf in the barren mountains and fields, carried water to plant seeds, and created many mountain vegetable gardens. When the villagers saw the lush green vegetables growing on the mountains, they gave a thumbs up and praised: "These cadres taught by Chairman Mao are really capable, they can overcome any difficulty."
	In the autumn of two years ago, cadres from many ministries and commissions of the Central Government moved into the mountains with their luggage. At that time, there were no vacant houses in the villages, so they cut through thorns, filled pits, and built tents on the river滩 or in the mountain hollows. With no roads up the mountain, they swung their hoes to open up roads, achieving that every mountain had a road, and every road was connected. People got up early and worked late to plant trees and open up terraces, often tripping over stubborn stones and being pricked by shrubs, and some even felt breathless, but no one was willing to fall behind. Some female cadres couldn't keep up with the young men when climbing mountains, so they "started early like a slow bird," secretly starting before others set off, and still arriving at the top of the mountain at the same time, without delaying work. If there were not enough labor tools, they learned to manufacture and repair them, and if they didn't understand the technology, they learned as they worked. In order to preserve moisture and prevent drought, many cadres braved the freezing cold, climbing mountains to collect snow in the severe winter of more than minus 20 degrees Celsius, and even carrying ice up the mountains. In this way, they unyieldingly developed diversified operations, mainly through afforestation and greening, determined to work hard for three to five years to turn the barren mountains into flower and fruit mountains, and to terrace the mountain slopes.
	In the large gully in the northwest, I heard touching stories of cadres from the Ministry of Chemical Industry settling down in the deep mountains and fighting against stubborn stones.
	At first, large and small vehicles could not enter the mountains, there was only a small path along the river, and countless stubborn stones blocked the way, which they described in a humorous way: "You have to 'dance' when you walk." In this way, everyone carried bed boards and pots and pans from Tailing, five miles away, to "settle down" in the mountains. Where to build houses? They strictly followed the instructions of their superiors, not occupying an inch of farmland from the villagers, and after searching around, they finally chose a rocky hill as the site for their houses. But this place was covered with stones, some as large as half a room, and some as small as a tabletop. To clear the foundations, several people used all their strength to pull out a stone, only to reveal an even larger stubborn stone underneath. When the nearby villagers saw this situation, they repeatedly advised: "The stones on the rocky hill can never be removed, cut our cornfield or dig up our sweet potato field for you to build houses!" They politely declined the villagers' kindness. Under the leadership of the production team's Party branch, everyone resolved not to give up until they had conquered the stubborn stones, and formed a construction team. Some learned stone masonry, and others learned carpentry and plastering. After more than a month of hard work, they finally cleared a piece of land in the rocky hill, using local materials, using stone instead of brick, and building more than thirty simple houses. In the process of fighting against the stubborn stones, they gradually accumulated experience and continued to declare war on the mountains and stones in this area, opening up production land.
	To the west of the production team headquarters, there is a vineyard and vegetable garden, which was originally full of rocks. This spring, a chemical technician named Jia Xiangzhong, who was known as a "strongman" and had just come to participate in labor production, had worked here for a year two years ago, and he had accumulated experience in fighting against stubborn stones. This time, when he heard that the Party branch had decided to turn the rocky hill into fertile land, he volunteered to lead seventeen people to take on this task. After a few days of hard work, some people saw that the large and small stones could not be moved, became timid, and wanted to retreat. At this time, the Party branch mobilized the masses to discuss "What should we do if we want to engage in production but have no land?" After a debate, some people who showed wavering in the face of difficulties further clarified that only by working hard can we have land. Jia Xiangzhong led everyone to work together, removing more than twenty truckloads of stubborn stones in one go, and then taking sand from the earth hills across the river to fill in the gaps, planting more than sixty grape seedlings, which are now in full bloom with lush branches and leaves. The cabbages in the vegetable garden are growing lush and green.
	"Seizing land from the mountains, fighting for every inch," is not an exaggeration to describe the situation of cadres from central state organs establishing a production base here. Ma Wu Mountain, located in the middle of the east and west gullies, is the place where cadres from the Ministry of Railways are advancing to the barren mountains. A wave of land reclamation was launched there last spring, with everyone carrying dry food and water bottles and hoes, running all over the ten-mile-long Ma Wu Mountain. No matter how steep the mountain or how dangerous the road, they reclaimed any cultivatable slope they found. In less than a week, they reclaimed more than sixty mu of cultivated land on more than thirty large and small ridges of Ma Wu Mountain. When spring plowing and sowing came, there was a shortage of water on the mountain, so they relayed water from the foot of the mountain to the top, ensuring that spring plowing was not delayed. The management of the fields in summer and autumn was even more meticulous, and everything from corn to sweet potatoes grew vigorously. Even the villagers living at the foot of the mountain were happy to see that the crops on the mountain promised a bumper harvest, saying: "We have never heard of such good crops growing since our ancestors, it must be because you have put in real effort to have such a good harvest!"
	Climbing over mountain after mountain, crossing gully after gully, I saw that the honor rolls newly posted in the courtyards of each production team had been covered up with old ones. The labor songs and harvest poems written by the people participating in production in their spare time were plastered all over the walls. I saw such verses on a bulletin board:
	Stepping on high mountains and ridges, swinging hoes to turn the land over,
	Sprinkling the sweat of labor, tasting the joy of a bountiful harvest.
	In this batch after batch of cadre labor teams, the vast majority are intellectuals who "cannot carry burdens on their shoulders or carry baskets in their hands." Now, after a year and a half or one month of labor training each year, some have become experts in afforestation or planting crops, and some have become skilled shepherds and pig farmers. Li Xiuyun, a well-known chicken farmer at the foot of Ma Wu Mountain, is hard to guess from his faded blue cloth clothes that he is a veteran engineer from the railway. When he first came to the mountainous area, he intended to "stand aside and guide others," but when he saw some veteran cadres who had been in the revolution for many years taking the lead in getting up early and working late, and the young men working even more happily, he secretly resolved not to fall behind. In a period of labor, he further realized the great significance of the Party's proposal for cadres to participate in productive labor. He thought: This is really a good opportunity for intellectuals to participate in labor training, and he was determined to be "red in the mountainous area and specialized in the mountainous area." Last spring, the production team bought a batch of chicks, and Li Xiuyun took on the task of raising them, guarding the chicks day and night in the hot room, for fear of crushing one to death. The production team leader was afraid that he would get sick from exhaustion, and repeatedly urged him to rest more, but he refused. Because he was so careful in raising them, the survival rate of the chicks was higher than that of other production teams. When he returned to Beijing for vacation, he didn't even want to watch dramas. When he had time, he ran to the Xinhua Bookstore to buy books and magazines on chicken raising. He bought various books on chicken raising and studied them, and combined them with his own raising work to explore a set of experience in preventing and treating chicken diseases. People like this who study hard, love labor, and develop organ production can be found in every production team.
	On the river灘 managed by the production team of the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry, I met Sun Yaoxian, a "shepherd" who had just returned from Inner Mongolia with a flock of a thousand sheep. From his dusty face, I could see the hardship of sleeping in the open and eating in the wind along the way. But when he talked about raising sheep, he seemed to forget all his fatigue.
	Sun Yaoxian was neither born as a shepherd nor had he studied animal husbandry and veterinary medicine. Before entering the mountains, he was a deputy section chief of the warehouse of the Tianjin Office of the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry. Two years ago, when the organs decided to establish a production base, he and many comrades first entered the mountains and served as the director of the sheep farm. What to do if he didn't understand herding techniques? He became a disciple of the old shepherds of the commune and learned by doing. One early morning, when he was herding sheep, he met Xie Delin, a skilled shepherd in the commune, and immediately talked about the problem of castrating sheep that he had been thinking about day and night. Xie Delin, a straightforward farmer, immediately said: "Let's castrate them right here!" Sun Yaoxian immediately ran back to his room happily to get a small knife. He first watched the old shepherd castrate three sheep, and learned to castrate three sheep on the spot. In less than an hour, he learned the technique of castrating sheep. Another time, suddenly more than ten sheep refused to eat grass, their jaws were tight, and they were spitting white foam. He ran to the nearby Xiakou Village overnight to visit old farmers. The old farmer asked about the sheep's condition and grazing location, and quickly said: "There is a poisonous weed called ‘flowered leaf reed’ in that gully. The sheep must have eaten it and been poisoned! It will be good to pour water from the roots of sweet dry grass into them." Sun Yaoxian came back and treated them in the same way, and it worked. From then on, whenever he herded sheep on that hillside, he would first check for poisonous weeds such as "flowered leaf reed", and also buy some sweet dry grass roots to prepare for treating the sheep. In this way, he studied and researched at any time and any place, and gradually mastered the techniques of raising sheep. At the same time, I saw two young people who had just come to participate in labor grazing the flock with him, but they could not yell like him, and even the naughty mountain sheep would move in the direction he instructed, and they could not tell at a glance what was wrong with the sheep that did not eat grass. On the surface, this change may seem very ordinary, but in essence it contains infinite revolutionary spirit. They are not only able to endure hardship and work hard, but more importantly, their thinking has begun to change. (Attached picture)

    发扬南泥湾精神	本报记者　孙世恺
    真凑巧，正想到泰陵中央国家机关造林生产基地去，那里指挥部的汽车就来了，而且当天要返回去。“和我们一起走吧！”在指挥部同志这样热情地邀请下，我们很快就出发了。
    汽车在昌平大道上奔驰，不到两小时就穿进丛林繁茂的泰陵山区。指挥部的同志高兴地冲着前方介绍说，中央国家机关二十多个部、委经常抽调一千多名干部，就在这片山区以绿化造林为主发展多种经营。虽然才只两年，已经开始改变了荒山野岭的面貌。
    从泰陵往北和西北有三条大沟，满山遍野一片翠绿。在这三万四千多亩土地上，已经栽种下三百万棵油松、侧柏和洋槐等幼树，还出现了许多苹果园、葡萄沟、鸡鸣峪。在新开垦的梯田上，长着茁壮的玉米、谷子和荞麦……依山建起的羊猪圈、鸡窝、兔舍，在绿丛中隐现。
    眼下正是秋收季节，人们津津有味地谈论着怎样力争秋收多多益善的办法和措施。两年前老乡们赶着毛驴走的羊肠小路，现在都修通了平坦的公路。这些天，从北京开来的汽车比往常更多了，送来成批的干部支援“三秋”工作。
    这一带，人人称赞农业部造林生产队的庄稼长得特别出色。当我们去访问时，正在收获玉米。赵化一队长拾起三棵都有八寸多长的大棒子，笑着说：“我们今年订亩产千斤的生产计划看来还是保守啦，没想到山地也有这样大的潜力，在树下石头地里种一亩玉米试验田竟产了一千三百五十斤，八字宪法真能叫大地翻身。”这时，走过一个满身泥土的青年人，放下手中镰刀，说：“我们这些五谷不分的知识分子取得这样丰收，确实来之不易。是在党的号召下，发扬了南泥湾的革命精神，我们战胜了‘三灾’，做到抗旱抗到天低头，天不降雨人降雨，抗草抗到草不生，有草就拔净；抗虫抗到虫死绝，一连喷药二十多次，……”就凭着这股坚韧不拔的革命毅力，他们从河滩到山坡种了四十九亩多大田作物，采取林粮间作、粮菜套种等办法，一块地种了三茬粮菜。现在梯田上种的六万棵大萝卜，长得一片青翠。
    这里的老乡从来没有种菜的习惯，认为山高天旱土地差，不长菜。两个月前，中央国家机关的干部响应党的号召，硬是在荒山野岭铲除了厚厚的草皮，担水点种，创造出许多山头菜园。老乡们看到山上长出油绿的蔬菜，翘起大拇指称赞说：“毛主席教导出来的这些干部真成，天大的困难也能战胜。”
    两年前的秋天，中央许多部、委的干部搬着行李进山了。当时，山里老乡住房没有空闲，他们就披荆斩棘，填坑补石，在河滩或山窝里搭起帐篷。上山无路，他们就挥动镢头开山辟路，实现了山山有路，路路相通。人们起早贪黑去植树开梯田，常常被顽石绊倒，被灌木刺痛，也有人感到喘不过气来，但是谁都不甘心掉队。有些女干部爬山赶不上小伙子，她们就“慢鸟先飞”，别人出发前一刻，她们就悄悄地先行，照样同时到达山顶，不误工活。劳动工具不足，他们就学着制造和修理，不懂技术，就边做边学。为了保墒防旱，许多干部不畏天寒地冻，在摄氏零下二十多度的严冬上山积雪，还背冰上山。他们就这样百折不挠地以绿化造林为主发展多种经营，决心苦战三五年，把荒山变成花果山，实现山坡地梯田化。
    在西北那条大沟里，我听到化工部干部深山落户和顽石搏斗的感人事迹。
    开初，大车小车都开不进山，只沿着河有一条小路，还有无数顽石拦道，用他们的一句俏皮话来形容：“走起路来都得‘跳舞’”。大家就这样从五里外的泰陵背着铺板和锅碗，到山里“安家落户”。在哪盖房子呢？他们严格遵守上级的指示，不占老乡一寸耕地，寻来找去最后选定一个乱石岗作房址。可是这里遍地是石头，大的有半间房大，小的也有桌面大。为清理房基，几个人用力拉出一块石头，底下又露出更大的顽石。附近的老乡们看到这样情况，再三劝说：“乱石岗的石头那弄得完，把我们的玉米地割了，或是白薯地起了，给你们盖房子吧！”他们婉言谢绝了乡亲们的盛意，在生产队党支部的领导下，大家抱定不战胜顽石誓不休的决心，组成了基建队，有人学石匠，也有人学木匠和抹灰。经过一个多月的艰苦奋斗，终于在乱石岗里清理出一片地，就地取材，以石代砖，因陋就简盖起了三十多间房子。他们在和顽石搏斗过程中逐渐积累了经验，继续向这一带山石宣战，开辟生产地。
    在生产队队部西边有一片葡萄园和菜园，原先乱石成堆。今年春天，新来参加劳动生产的干部中有个号称“大力士”的化工技术员贾祥仲，在两年前进山时曾在这里劳动过一年，他在劳动中积累下和顽石搏斗的经验。这次，他听说党支部又决定把乱石岗变成良田，自报奋勇带领十七个人包下这个任务，苦干了几天，有的人看到大小石头搬不完，胆怯了，想打退堂鼓。这时，党支部发动群众讨论“我们要搞生产，没有地该怎样办？”经过一场争论，一些在困难面前表现动摇的人也进一步明确只有穷干苦干才有地的道理。贾祥仲带领大家齐动手，一鼓作气搬走了二十多卡车顽石，又从河对面的土山包上取回沙土填进去，栽上了六十多棵葡萄秧，现已成架，枝叶繁茂。菜园里的大白菜长得油绿。
    “与山夺地，寸土必争”，用这句话来形容中央国家机关的干部在这里建立生产基地的情形，并不算夸大。在东西两条大沟中间的马武山，是铁道部的干部向荒山进军的场所。在去年春天掀起了一个开荒热潮，人人带着干粮和水壶，扛着镢头跑遍十多里长的马武山，不管山多陡路多险，见到可耕的坡地就开垦，不到一个星期功夫，在马武山的大小三十多条山岭开垦出六十多亩耕地。春耕播种时，山上缺水，他们就从山脚往上接力担水挑肥，保证了春耕不误农时。夏秋的田间管理更精心，不论玉米或白薯样样长得茁壮。连住在山下的老乡们看到山上的庄稼丰收在望，都高兴地说：“从老辈传下来也没听说长过这样好的庄稼，该是你们下了真功夫，才有这样好收成啊！”
    爬过一座山又一座山，穿过一条谷又一条谷，看到每个生产队的院子里新贴出的光荣榜又盖上了旧的。参加生产的人们在劳动余暇编写的劳动颂、丰收诗刊贴满了墙。我从一张壁报上看到了这样的诗句：
    脚踏高山峻岭，挥锹叫土地翻身，
    撒下劳动的汗珠，饱尝丰收的喜悦。
    在这一批又一批的干部劳动队伍里，绝大多数是“肩不能担担，手不曾提篮”的知识分子。现在，他们经过一年半载或每年一个月的劳动锻炼，有的成了造林或种庄稼的能手，也有的成了在行的羊工、猪倌。马武山下有个人人知名的养鸡饲养员李秀云，从他经常穿的一身褪了色的蓝布衣裳，很难猜出是一个来自铁路上的老工程师。他刚来山区时，抱着“袖手指导别人工作”的打算，可是看到一些革命多年的老干部带头起早贪黑搞生产，青年小伙子干得更欢，自己才暗自下定决心不甘落后。在一段劳动中，进一步体会到党提出干部参加生产劳动的重大意义，他想：这真是知识分子参加劳动锻炼的好机会，决心做到“红在山区，专在山区”。去年春天，生产队买进一批小鸡，李秀云担任饲养任务，在高温的屋里日夜守护鸡雏，生怕压死一个。生产队长怕他累病了，三番五次地催他多休息一下，他都不肯。由于他这样细心饲养，小鸡的成活率比其他生产队都高。他回到北京休假时，连戏都不想看，有时间就跑到新华书店选购养鸡的书刊，他买到各种有关养鸡书籍回去钻研，又结合自己的饲养工作，摸索出一套养鸡防病的经验。像这样刻苦钻研、热爱劳动发展机关生产的人，在哪个生产队都能找到。
    在冶金部生产队经管的河滩上，我会见一位刚从内蒙古赶回千只羊群的“羊工”孙耀先。从他满脸风尘看得出沿途露宿风餐的辛苦。但谈起养羊的事，又好像一切疲劳都忘掉了。
    孙耀先既不是羊工出身，又没学过畜牧兽医，进山以前是冶金部驻天津办事处仓库的一个副科长。两年前当机关决定建立生产基地时，他和许多同志首先进了山，担任羊场场长。不懂牧羊技术怎么办？他就拜公社的老羊工为师，边做边学。一天清早，他赶羊放牧碰见公社里牧羊能手谢德林，马上谈起他日夜苦思的骟羊问题。谢德林是个心直口快的农民，马上说：“咱们就地骟吧！”孙耀先立即高兴地跑回房里取来小刀。他先看老羊工骟了三只羊，当场也学着骟了三只，没有一个小时他学会了一门骟羊的技术，又一次，突然有十多只羊不吃草，牙关紧闭吐白沫，他连夜跑到附近的下口村访问老农。老农问清羊的病情和放牧地点，连忙说：“那条沟里有毒草‘花叶芦’，一定是羊吃了中毒啦！用甜干草根的水灌下去就好。”孙耀先回来照样除治果然见效。从那以后，他到那个山坡牧羊，都先查找有无“花叶芦”等毒草，还买些甜干草根准备给羊治病。他就这样随时随地学习钻研，日积月累掌握了饲养羊的技术。同时，我看到两个新来参加劳动的青年人跟他一起赶着羊群放牧，就不能像他那样吆喝一声，连调皮的山羊也会按着他指示的方向活动，更不能像他那样一眼看出不吃草的羊出了什么毛病。从表面看起来，这种变化也许是很平常，实质上却蕴藏着无限的革命精神。他们不只是能够吃苦耐劳，更重要的是他们的思想开始发生了变化。（附图片）
