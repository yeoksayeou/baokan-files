    The Vitamins of Steel
    Bing Pu
    Steel plays a backbone role in industrial construction, and all industry, transportation, and national defense are inseparable from steel. However, steel itself is not without its weaknesses. People who are physically weak often use vitamins to nourish themselves, turning weakness into strength. Steel can also use other metals to "nourish" itself, making up for its own shortcomings, and making it more suitable for industrial construction and national defense needs.
    Ancient craftsmen had long been able to make extremely hard and sharp swords. No one knew exactly why they were so hard at first, but it was later discovered that the ore for steelmaking contained tungsten.
    During World War I, the armor steel plates of British tanks, although very thick, were destroyed by German shells. After testing, it was discovered that the German shells contained a small amount of metallic tungsten. Therefore, the British studied adding small amounts of chromium, manganese, nickel, and molybdenum to the steel, and the resulting alloy steel plates were only one-third the thickness of the original steel plates, but the German shells could no longer penetrate them.
    Tungsten steel has high hardness and strength, and still occupies a particularly important position in alloy steel. If a small amount of chromium and vanadium is added to tungsten steel containing 18% tungsten, it becomes a very good high-speed cutting steel. The cutting tools made of this steel maintain their hardness even when the cutting edge is red-hot during cutting.
    Steel is attracted to magnets and becomes magnetic, which people have long known. However, for some industrial needs that require strong magnetic force and must use steel, it is indeed a difficult problem to solve. People have discovered that as long as 14% manganese is added to the steel, it will no longer be attracted by magnets. This type of steel is suitable for use in the rudder rooms of warships and all steel components close to compasses. High-manganese steel and manganese-containing special steel also have the characteristics of being stainless and resistant to chemical corrosion. Particularly strange is that if this manganese steel is heated to a deep yellow color and immediately cooled, it does not become brittle like other manganese steels, but instead has toughness. This makes it extremely suitable for making steel helmets and various components that are constantly vibrating, such as bulldozer and ore crusher shafts, steel rails, and bridges.
    As long as silicon steel sheets made by adding 2.5% silicon to steel are used as the iron core of transformers, not only can the transformer's heating be reduced, but also a large amount of electrical energy can be saved. Some people estimate that silicon steel sheets save us tens of millions of tons of coal each year in this regard.
    Steel rusting is the most troubling thing. If 12% chromium is added to steel, it becomes stainless steel. Stainless steel does not rust because chromium is oxidized to form a protective layer of chromium oxide. This stainless steel is not only rustproof but also corrosion-resistant, making it an important material in the chemical industry. Chromium steel also has good elasticity and hardness, and can be used for parts such as car springs and axles.
    Thermal expansion and contraction are characteristics possessed by most metals, but people require a metal or alloy that is unaffected by heat and cold in the manufacture of some more precise instruments or clocks. Nickel steel containing 36% nickel can meet this requirement. Nickel steel containing 3.5% nickel is an important material for airplanes and bridges.
    In addition, after adding heat-resistant metals such as niobium, tantalum, and titanium to steel to make turbine blades that can withstand high temperatures, the strength of the turbine can be greatly improved and the service life of the turbine can be extended. Vanadium steel made by adding a small amount of vanadium to steel can double the elasticity of the steel, and all kinds of spring steel contain a small amount of vanadium. Adding vanadium, tungsten, cobalt, and other metals to steel can make permanent magnets for radios, loudspeakers and telecommunications materials.
    Tungsten, molybdenum, chromium, manganese, nickel, silicon... are all vitamins of steel.

    钢的维生素
    秉朴
    钢在工业建设中起着骨干作用，一切工业交通运输和国防等都离不开钢铁。不过钢本身不是没有弱点的。身体虚弱的人常用维生素补养，使身体转弱为强，钢也可以用其他金属来“营养”自己，弥补自身的缺陷，使它更加适合工业建设和国防的需要。
    古代的工匠早已会制造极坚硬而锋利的刀剑了。究竟为什么那么坚硬，最初没有人知道，以后才发现原来是炼钢的矿石里含有钨。
    在第一次世界大战时，英国坦克车装甲钢板虽然很厚，却被德军炮弹击毁。经过化验才知道德军炮弹壳里含有少量的金属钨。于是英国人研究在钢里加入少量的铬、锰、镍和钼后，做出的合金钢板仅有原来钢板厚度的三分之一，可是德军的炮弹再也打不透了。
    钨钢硬度高，强度大，至今在合金钢中有着特别重要的地位。如果在含钨18％的钨钢里再加入少量的铬和钒，就成为很好的高速切削钢。这种钢作的刀具即使在切削时刃口已经赤热，而硬度仍保持不变。
    钢与磁铁接近会被吸引而带有磁性，这是人们早已知道的事。但是工业上某些需要强大磁力，而又必须用钢铁的工业来说，确实是不易解决的问题。人们发现只要在钢里加入14％的锰就不再被磁铁吸引了。这种钢适于用做军舰的舵室以及一切和罗盘接近的钢铁构件。高锰钢及含锰的特殊钢还有着不锈和耐化学腐蚀的特点。特别奇怪的是这种锰钢如加热到深黄色时立即冷却，它就不像其它锰钢那样发脆反而具有韧性。这就极适合做钢盔以及经常处于震动的各种构件，如推土机、碎矿机的轴辊和钢轨、桥梁等。
    只要用钢里加入2.5％的硅做成的矽钢片来做变压器的铁心，不仅能减少变压器发热现象，而且还节约大量的电能。有人估计矽钢片在这方面每年替我们节省的煤炭将有成千万吨。
    钢铁生锈是使人最伤脑筋的事，如在钢里加12％的铬就成为不锈钢了。不锈钢不生锈是由于铬被氧化后生成了一层氧化铬的保护层。这种不锈钢不仅能防锈而且还具有防腐蚀性能，是化学工业上的重要材料。铬钢还有较好的弹性和硬度，可以做汽车弹簧和轮轴等零件。
    热胀冷缩是绝大多数金属所具有的特性，但是人们在某些较为精密的仪表或钟表制造上要求能找到一种不受冷热影响的金属或合金，含镍36％的镍钢能满足这一要求。含镍3.5％的镍钢是飞机和桥梁的重要材料。
    此外，钢里加入铌、钽、钛等耐热金属后，制成汽轮机轮叶能耐高温，这样就可以大大提高汽轮机的强度和延长汽轮机的使用时间。加入少量的钒做成的钒钢，能使钢的弹性提高一倍，在各种弹簧钢里都含有少量的钒。钢里加入钒、钨、钴和另外一些金属就能做成永久磁铁。做无线电的喇叭和电讯材料等。
    钨、钼、铬、锰、镍、硅……都是钢的维生素。
