　　General Luo Ruiqing spoke at the banquet, which was filled with a friendly atmosphere. On behalf of all commanders and fighters of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, he extended warm congratulations to the distinguished Burmese guests, the Burmese people, and the Burmese Federal Defense Forces, as well as to all friends who have worked to establish a peaceful and friendly boundary between China and Burma.

　　When speaking about the China-Burma border talks, General Luo Ruiqing said that the border talks between our two countries have been going very smoothly, and the China-Burma Border Treaty is about to be signed. The resolution of the border issue between the two countries is a common victory for the peoples of China and Burma and a victory for the implementation of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence between countries with different social systems.

　　General Luo Ruiqing said that the armies of China and Burma have consistently conducted friendly cooperation and close exchanges in recent years to maintain the friendship between China and Burma and the tranquility of the border between the two countries. I believe that with the emergence of a peaceful and friendly border between our two countries, the kinship-like friendship between our two peoples and the friendly exchanges between the two armies will surely develop further.

　　Brigadier General Aung Gyi spoke at the banquet, thanking the hosts for their hospitality. Brigadier General Aung Gyi said that the fourth meeting of our China-Burma Joint Boundary Committee has only been going on for two days, and it has already achieved great success. Soon, the Prime Ministers of Burma and China will sign the border treaty.

　　In his speech, Brigadier General Aung Gyi enthusiastically spoke about the friendship between the armies of Burma and China. He said that the armies of Burma and China are both engaged in the struggle against imperialism and are actively engaged in the construction of their respective countries. At present, they are also participating in the demarcation of the China-Burma border. In the cause of defending world peace, the two armies have also carried out the same cooperation. He said that our two armies have so many common points, and I believe that they will surely carry out full cooperation in the future to make greater contributions to the development of friendship between the two peoples and the defense of world peace.

　　Brigadier General Aung Gyi said that we all use the Bandung spirit and the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence as our weapons. We have mastered these weapons, and we believe that in the future, we will surely achieve great victories in the struggle to defend world peace.

　　Burmese representatives of the China-Burma Joint Boundary Committee: Burmese Ambassador to China Kyaw Winn, Secretary of Kachin State Affairs U San Lun, Director of the Border Area Administration Bureau Colonel So Min, Commissioner of North Shan State U Khun Ohn Kya, and guests such as Shan Yoe, Brigadier General Commander of the Northern Military Region of Burma, were invited to attend the banquet.
