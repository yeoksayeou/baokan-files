Xinhua News Agency, Lhasa, September 11th: Panchen Erdini, Acting Chairman of the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region, and Vice Chairman Pagbalha Geleg Namgyal, inspected the autumn harvest work in Qushui County in the Lhasa area on the 8th. Zhou Renshan, Deputy Secretary of the Tibet Working Committee of the Communist Party of China and Standing Committee Member of the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region, accompanied them.

Qushui County is located about seventy kilometers southwest of Lhasa, where the Lhasa River and the Yarlung Zangbo River converge. It is one of the main agricultural areas in Tibet. In a highland barley field by the Yarlung Zangbo River, Panchen Erdini watched an agricultural production mutual aid team harvesting crops. Panchen Erdini had a cordial conversation with the farmers in the field. The head of the mutual aid team, Dorje, a former serf, told him that a bumper harvest had been achieved this year. He said that the farmers have now begun autumn plowing, land reclamation, seed selection, and fertilizer accumulation, preparing to win an even greater harvest next year. Panchen Erdini encouraged the farmers to listen carefully to the Communist Party, give full play to collective strength, and build a happy new life.

Panchen Erdini also watched the farmers threshing grain with stone rollers. In the past, under the feudal serf system, Tibetan rural areas had always driven yaks to trample on highland barley ears, but this year they are basically using stone rollers for threshing. Panchen Erdini was very excited to see the harvest scene in rural Tibet. He said: "In just one year, such tremendous new changes have taken place in rural Tibet, and the lives of the broad masses of people are becoming increasingly prosperous under the leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao."

    班禅额尔德尼在西藏农村视察
    新华社拉萨11日电　西藏自治区筹备委员会代理主任委员班禅额尔德尼和副主任委员帕巴拉·卓列朗杰，8日在拉萨地区的曲水县视察了那里的秋收工作。同行的有中共西藏工委副书记、西藏自治区筹备委员会常务委员周仁山。
    曲水县位于拉萨市西南约七十公里，拉萨河和雅鲁藏布江在这里汇合，是西藏主要的农业区之一。班禅额尔德尼在雅鲁藏布江边的一块青稞田里，观看了一个农业生产互助组收割庄稼的情形。班禅额尔德尼在田间和农民们作了亲切的交谈。互助组长、过去的农奴多列告诉他，今年获得大丰收。他说，现在农民们已经着手进行秋耕、开荒、选种、积肥，准备在明年夺取更大的丰收。班禅额尔德尼鼓励农民们好好地听共产党的话，发挥集体力量，建设幸福的新生活。
    班禅额尔德尼还观看了农民们用石磙打场的情形。过去，在封建农奴制度下，西藏农村一直是驱赶牦牛踩踏青稞麦穗，今年已基本上都用石磙打场了。班禅额尔德尼看到西藏农村的丰收景象很兴奋。他说：“只一年时间，西藏农村已发生了如此巨大的新变化，广大人民在共产党和毛主席的领导下，生活正在日益富裕起来。”（附图片）
