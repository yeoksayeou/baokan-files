    The connection between transportation and agricultural production is very close. Not only do waterways and highways have crisscrossing lines that penetrate into the vast countryside, serving as a link connecting rural and urban areas and connecting agriculture with industry, but transportation is also an important component in rural production activities such as field production and farmland water conservancy construction. That is to say, transportation not only affects agricultural production from the outside, but also affects agricultural production from within agriculture. This requires transportation departments to better support agricultural work.
    At present, transportation's support for agriculture mainly needs to focus on two aspects. One aspect is to prioritize the transportation of agricultural materials, especially the various materials needed for grain production, ahead of the farming season, to promote increased agricultural production. The other aspect is to actively and systematically help rural people's communes accelerate the realization of transportation technology transformation, improve the face of rural transportation, and save a large number of laborers from the short-distance transportation and field transportation front to strengthen the front line of agricultural production.
    With the emergence of a new upsurge of the whole party and the whole people running agriculture and running grain production in a big way, and with the expansion of industrial support for agriculture, the volume of rural transportation and the transportation of industrial products to the countryside has become more heavy. Prioritizing the transportation of materials needed for agricultural production, ensuring that whatever agriculture needs is transported, whenever it is needed, and as much as is needed, is an important task for transportation to support agriculture. The key to doing this work well lies in grasping transportation organization work. The transportation of agricultural materials is more dispersed and involves more transportation links than transportation between cities. It generally has to go through several different means of transport for transshipment. In this way, if the organization of transportation work is not done well, and one link does not keep up, it will affect the timely delivery of these materials to their final destination. An effective method for doing a good job in transportation organization is to organize a one-stop transportation line, organically connect the scattered, multi-link transportation into one go. When Fengjie County, Sichuan Province, was rushing to transport a batch of potato seeds urgently needed from Jiangsu and other places, it organized a one-stop water-land joint transportation of automobiles, wooden boats, and loading and unloading, so that the transportation work achieved someone to move it out of the warehouse, boats to load it at the river, and cars to pick it up on the highway, stopping at every station and linking every link, and quickly and smoothly completed the task of rushing transportation. In addition, many transportation units have also carried out rural incidental transportation, using all return vehicles and return tonnage to carry agricultural materials. This is also an effective method to fully utilize the potential of transportation equipment and ensure the priority transportation of agricultural materials without delaying the farming season.
    Of course, it is difficult to complete the agricultural material transportation tasks with extremely large quantities and extremely wide distribution areas by relying solely on the strength of the transportation departments. This requires the transportation departments to do everything possible to tap potential on the one hand, and to earnestly help the people's communes consolidate professional transportation teams and continuously improve the management level of professional transportation teams, so that professional transportation teams can shoulder greater agricultural material transportation tasks. All transportation units should help the people's communes rectify, consolidate, and improve professional transportation teams through forms such as linking up with communes, and fully utilize the potential of professional transportation teams. When helping people's communes rectify, consolidate, and improve professional transportation teams, in addition to establishing and improving various management systems to improve transportation efficiency, special attention should also be paid to correctly solving the relationships between the transportation team and the agricultural production team, accumulation and distribution, and the commune, production team, and transportation team. It must be clear that after the establishment of the people's communes, the past scattered, small-batch, and decentralized transportation in rural areas has been transformed into relatively large-scale, batch-based, and centralized transportation; at the same time, due to the comprehensive development of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries and commune-run industries, the number of regular transportation tasks is increasing day by day. Under such circumstances, it is entirely necessary for the people's communes to draw a certain amount of transportation forces to form professional transportation teams to undertake regular transportation tasks without affecting agricultural production; however, professional transportation teams must save manpower as much as possible, and must serve agricultural production closely, and transport agricultural production, means of livelihood, and agricultural and sideline products in a timely manner; during busy farming seasons, some forces should also be drawn to participate in agricultural production, and become shock brigades for field transportation. In this way, professional transportation teams can be completely consolidated.
    In addition to prioritizing the transportation of agricultural materials, another important task for transportation departments to support agriculture is to help people's communes realize the technical transformation of rural transportation. At present, the transportation work occupies the most labor force and has the greatest potential for saving labor force in agricultural labor. Generally speaking, the labor force used by rural people's communes for field transportation, farmland water conservancy construction transportation, and short-distance transportation accounts for about one-third of the total labor force of the commune, and in areas with inconvenient transportation, this proportion is even larger. The transportation departments help the people's communes accelerate the realization of the technical transformation of rural transportation, which can not only improve the material and technical conditions of rural transportation and better complete the transportation tasks of agricultural materials, but also enable the people's communes to save a large amount of labor force from transportation and enrich the front line of agricultural production. This is a very important work and the most concrete and powerful measure to support agriculture.
    In order to support rural areas to realize the technical transformation of transportation, the transportation departments should help rural people's communes to carry out "one network and five transformations" in a big way. "One network and five transformations" refers to the realization of vehicleization, railization, chuteization, cablewayization, and shipping, and connecting them into a transportation network. This is an effective measure to gradually realize the technical transformation of rural transportation, save labor force, and improve transportation efficiency based on existing conditions. In the past, the labor force used for transportation in Zhiping Commune, Qingning County, Fujian Province, accounted for 80% of the total labor force of the commune. After carrying out "one network and five transformations" in a big way this year, the entire commune can save one million labor days a year. These saved agricultural labor days are used for agricultural production, which is equivalent to doubling the existing agricultural labor force of the commune. What a great potential! The transportation departments in all regions should help the people's communes promote the experience of "one network and five transformations" in light of local conditions in accordance with the principles of self-reliance, local materials, saving land, focusing on small indigenous methods, ensuring quality and quantity. For those communes that have already realized "one network and five transformations," they should further help them improve the types of vehicles and ships, and promote various advanced transportation experiences, such as trainization and sailization of ox and horse carts, towage of wooden sailboats, and comprehensive utilization of agricultural machinery to manufacture multi-purpose vehicles and multi-purpose ships, and utilization of canals for navigation, etc. In addition, it is also necessary to help the people's communes appropriately develop the repair and fitting forces of transportation tools (and also repair agricultural machinery), so that the private transportation tools can achieve "small repairs do not leave the team, and major repairs do not leave the commune," and the automobiles and tractors can achieve "small repairs do not leave the county, and major repairs do not leave the special zone."
    Helping the people's communes to realize "one network and five transformations" should be carried out in a planned and step-by-step manner. On the one hand, it is necessary to combine it with farmland water conservancy construction to do a good job in rural transportation planning; on the other hand, it is necessary to proceed from the current specific conditions and act in accordance with the principles of taking advantage of every opportunity, doing more during the slack farming season, doing less during the busy farming season, and not doing it during the very busy farming season. In this work, the transportation departments should not only help the people's communes with planning, design, construction, and support necessary equipment, but also take various ways to cultivate various technical talents for the communes. Before the transportation industry of the people's communes has not been established and the technical forces have not been cultivated, the transportation departments should organize mobile repair teams or technical service teams to help the communes rush to repair or regularly overhaul transportation tools and other agricultural machinery, and in coordination with the farming season, tour the countryside to help the communes repair bridges and roads.
    At present, many transportation units have already made many achievements in supporting agricultural activities. In the past two years, especially since the work of running rural short-distance transportation in a big way since last winter and this spring, it has also accumulated some valuable experience for the transportation departments to help rural areas develop transportation and transform the technical appearance of rural transportation. As long as we fully mobilize the masses and make every employee on the transportation front establish the idea of taking agriculture as the foundation and supporting agriculture for a long time, the transportation departments will certainly be able to contribute more to supporting agriculture.

    交通运输支援农业的两项任务
    交通运输同农业生产的联系十分紧密，不仅水上运输和公路运输都有纵横交错的线路深入到广大农村，是把农村和城市联系起来、把农业同工业联系起来的纽带；而且在田间生产、农田水利建设等农村生产活动中，交通运输也是一个重要组成部分。这就是说，交通运输不仅从外部对农业生产发生影响，而且从农业的内部对农业生产发生影响。这就要求交通运输部门要更好地做好支援农业的工作。
    交通运输支援农业，目前主要要做好两个方面的工作。一个方面的工作是优先运送农业物资，特别是粮食生产所需要的各种物资，赶在农时季节的前面，促进农业增产；另一个方面的工作是积极地、有计划地帮助农村人民公社加速实现运输技术改造，改善农村交通运输的面貌，从短途运输和田间运输战线上节约出大批劳动力来加强农业生产第一线。
    随着全党全民大办农业、大办粮食的新高潮的出现，随着工业扩大对农业的支援，农村运输量和工业品下乡的运输量更加繁重了。优先运送农业生产需要的物资，做到农业要什么就运什么，需要什么时候运就什么时候运，需要运多少就运多少，这是交通运输支援农业的一项重要工作。做好这件工作，关键在于抓紧运输组织工作。农业物资的运输，比起城市之间的运输来，是比较分散的，运输环节比较多，一般都要经过好几种不同的运输工具转运。这样，如果运输的组织工作做得不好，有一个环节没有跟上来，就会影响这些物资按时运到最终目的地。做好运输组织工作的一个行之有效的方法就是组织一条龙运输线，把分散的、多环节的运输有机地衔接起来，连成一气。四川省奉节县在抢运一批江苏等地急需的马铃薯种子时，就组织了汽车、木船和搬运装卸的一条龙水陆联运，使运输工作做到了出仓有人搬，运到河边有船装，到了公路有车接，站站不停，环环相扣，很快就顺利完成了抢运任务。此外，许多运输单位还开展了农村捎脚运输，利用一切回空车和回空吨位，捎运农业物资。这也是充分发挥运输设备的潜力，保证不误农时优先运送农业物资的一个有效的方法。
    当然，仅仅依靠交通运输部门的力量，要完成数量极其巨大、地区的分布又极其广阔的农业物资运输任务，是有困难的。这就要求交通运输部门一方面千方百计地挖掘潜力，另一方面认真帮助人民公社巩固专业运输队，不断地提高专业运输队的经营管理水平，使专业运输队能够担负起更大的农业物资运输任务。各个交通运输单位应该通过同公社挂钩等形式，帮助人民公社整顿、巩固和提高专业运输队，充分发挥专业运输队的潜力。在帮助人民公社整顿、巩固和提高专业运输队时，除了要建立和健全各种经营管理制度、提高运输效率外，还要特别重视正确解决运输队和农业生产队、积累和分配、以及公社、生产队和运输队等各方面的关系。必须明确，人民公社成立以后，过去农村的零星的、小批的、分散的运输，已经转变为比较大量的、成批的、集中的运输；同时，由于农林牧副渔和社办工业的全面发展，经常性的运输任务日益增多。在这种情况下，各个人民公社在不影响农业生产的原则下，抽出一定的运输力量，组成专业运输队，担负经常性的运输任务，是完全必要的；但是，专业运输队必须要尽可能地节约人力，并且要紧紧为农业生产服务，及时运输农业生产、生活资料和农副产品；在农忙时，还应抽调部分力量参加农业生产，并成为田间运输的突击队。这样，专业运输队才能完全巩固下来。
    除了优先运送农业物资外，交通运输部门支援农业的另一个重要任务，是帮助人民公社实现农村运输的技术改造。目前农业劳动中占用劳动力最多、节约劳动力潜力最大的，是运输工作。一般说来，农村人民公社用于田间运输、农田水利建设运输和短途运输的劳动力，要占到公社劳动力总数的三分之一左右，在交通不便的地区，这个比重还要大一些。交通运输部门帮助人民公社加速实现农村运输的技术改造，不但可以改善农村交通运输的物质技术条件，更好地完成农业物资的运输任务，而且可以使人民公社从运输方面节省出大量劳动力，充实农业生产第一线。这是一件有十分重要意义的工作，是支援农业的最具体最有力的措施。
    为了支援农村实现运输技术改造，交通运输部门应当帮助农村人民公社大搞“一网五化”。“一网五化”，即实现车子化、轨道化、溜槽化、索道化和船运化，并使之连成一个交通运输网，这是从现有条件出发，逐步实现农村运输技术改造，节省劳动力，提高运输效率的有效措施。福建省清宁县治平公社，过去用于运输的劳动力占公社总劳动力的80％，今年大搞“一网五化”以后，全公社一年可以节省一百万个劳动日，这些节约的农业劳动日用于农业生产，就等于公社现有的农业劳动力增添了一倍。这是多么大的潜力啊！各地交通运输部门都要帮助人民公社根据自力更生、就地取材、节约土地和小土为主、保质保量的方针，因地制宜地推广“一网五化”的经验。对于那些已经实现了“一网五化”的公社，还要进一步帮助他们改良车型、船型，推广各种先进的运输经验。如牛马车列车化、风帆化，木帆船拖带化，以及综合利用农业机械制造多用车、多用船，利用渠道通航等等。此外，还要帮助人民公社适当发展运输工具修配力量（同时也修理农业机械），做到民间运输工具“小修不出队，大修不出社”，并做到汽车、拖拉机“小修不出县、大修不出专区”。
    帮助人民公社实现“一网五化”，要有计划有步骤地进行。一方面要结合农田水利建设，做好农村交通运输规划；一方面又要从目前的具体条件出发，按照见缝插针、农闲多搞、农忙少搞、特忙不搞的原则办事。在这项工作中，交通运输部门不仅要帮助人民公社规划、设计、施工、支援必要的设备，而且要采取各种方式为公社培养各种技术人材。在人民公社的交通工业还没有建立起来，技术力量还没有培养出来以前，交通运输部门应该组织流动修理组或技术服务队，帮助公社抢修或定期检修运输工具和其他农业机械，并配合农事季节，巡回下乡，帮助公社修桥筑路。
    目前，许多交通运输单位在支援农业的活动中已经做出了不少的成绩。过去两年中，特别是去冬今春以来大办农村短途运输的工作中，也为交通运输部门帮助农村发展运输事业，改造农村运输技术面貌积累了一些可贵的经验。只要我们充分发动群众，使交通运输战线上的每个职工都树立起以农业为基础，长期支援农业的思想，交通运输部门就一定能在支援农业中贡献更大的力量。
