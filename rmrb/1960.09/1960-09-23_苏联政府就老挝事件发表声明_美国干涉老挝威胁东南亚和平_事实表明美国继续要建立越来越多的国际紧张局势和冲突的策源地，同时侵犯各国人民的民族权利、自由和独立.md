Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, September 21st: The Soviet government has issued a statement on the Laotian situation, firmly condemning the U.S. government and its partners in the Southeast Asia aggressive bloc for interfering in the internal affairs of Laos. The statement said that as a member of the 1954 Geneva Conference on Indochina and one of the chairmen of the conference, the Soviet government cannot ignore the U.S. and its Southeast Asia Treaty Organization's partners' blatant interference in the internal affairs of Laos.

The Soviet government's statement said that the dramatic events in Laos in recent weeks prove that the Laotian people and their patriotic forces are no longer willing to tolerate a government that kowtows to the United States and its agents in Laos and plunges the country into political turmoil, economic bankruptcy, and fratricidal war. The actions of the Laotian army on August 9th, supported by the broad masses, overthrew the government that was implementing the policy of turning Laos into a U.S. military base and semi-colony. The new Laotian government, headed by Prince Souvanna Phouma, announced its intention to strictly abide by the Geneva Accords, implement a policy of neutrality and develop normal relations with all countries, and restore domestic peace. This program of the new Laotian government is deeply satisfying to all those who do not pursue any selfish aims in Laos and cherish the interests of maintaining peace in Southeast Asia.

However, the statement continued, the United States and its Southeast Asia Treaty Organization partners hold a different view. Unwilling to accept Laos' turn to a neutral policy, the United States began to instigate its puppets to plot rebellions against the government trusted by the parliament and the people. To this end, they even committed acts of betrayal. On the one hand, U.S. officials verbally assured that the United States did not oppose Phouma and the government he led, while on the other hand, the rebellion against the legitimate government, commanded by Phoumi Nosavan, was organized under U.S. instigation and support. Efforts are being made to conceal the guiding role of the United States in this general's actions. However, it is no longer a secret that dollars, weapons, and ammunition are constantly supplied to the traitors, and U.S. military advisers are the real masters in the rebel army.

The Soviet government then exposed in the statement the various facts of the U.S. and the Southeast Asia aggressive bloc's interference in Laos. The statement pointed out that before launching the rebellion, Phoumi Nosavan had secretly negotiated in Bangkok, the capital of Thailand, where the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization headquarters is located. Immediately afterwards, the Thai government provided its territory to allow the rebel army commanded by Phoumi Nosavan to move towards the Laotian capital, Vientiane. Within the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization, plans are being brewed to separate the southern provinces from Laos. The Thai and South Vietnamese authorities have ordered their troops to enter combat readiness and are massing them on the Laotian border. Thai warships constantly provoke military conflicts, repeatedly firing on Laotian ships and troops.

Recently, the leaders of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization have increasingly frequently clamored that "the time has come for the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization to act in Laos." Therefore, the news that the United States has sent aircraft carriers, destroyers, transport ships carrying marines, and landing ships to the South China Sea near Laos has aroused particular vigilance.

The statement emphasized that it cannot be ignored that the aim of the actions of the United States and its servants, such as Thailand and South Vietnam, is to provoke a civil war in Laos. This harbors dangerous consequences for peace in Indochina and Southeast Asia. The Laotian incident once again shows that the United States continues to advance along the dangerous path of creating more and more sources of international tension and conflict, and at the same time infringes on the national rights, freedom, and independence of all peoples. The invasion of Cuba, the conspiracies of the colonialist group in the Congo, the blatant interference in the internal affairs of Laos—all these are links in a policy that the U.S. government is pursuing, which is to do everything possible to oppose the national rejuvenation and independent aspirations of the peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America.

The statement concluded that the Soviet Union is watching the heroic struggle of the Laotian people for freedom and national independence. The Soviet government believes it is necessary to warn the U.S. government and its partners in the Southeast Asia aggressive bloc that they will bear serious responsibility for grossly violating the 1954 Geneva Accords. The Soviet people's sympathy is on the side of the freedom-loving Laotian people.

    苏联政府就老挝事件发表声明
　　美国干涉老挝威胁东南亚和平
　　事实表明美国继续要建立越来越多的国际紧张局势和冲突的策源地，同时侵犯各国人民的民族权利、自由和独立
    新华社22日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科21日讯：苏联政府就老挝事件发表声明，坚决谴责美国政府和它的东南亚侵略集团的伙伴干涉老挝内政的行为。声明说：作为1954年关于印度支那问题的日内瓦会议的成员和这次会议的主席之一，苏联政府对美国及其东南亚条约侵略集团的伙伴粗暴干涉老挝内政的事实不能置之不理。
    苏联政府的声明说，最近几个星期来，老挝发生的剧烈的事件证明，老挝人民及其爱国力量不愿再容忍由对美国及其在老挝的代理人卑躬屈膝、把国家推入政治混乱、经济破产和自相残杀的战争中去的政府来掌握国家政权这样一种局面了。受到广大群众支持的老挝军队在今年8月9日的行动，使执行变老挝为美国军事基地和半殖民地政策的政府垮了台。以富马亲王为首的老挝新政府宣布它打算严格遵守日内瓦协议，执行中立和发展同一切国家的正常关系的政策，并恢复国内和平。老挝新政府的这一纲领，使一切不在老挝追求任何自私目的并珍视维护东南亚和平利益的人深感满意。
    但是，声明接着说，美国及其东南亚条约组织的伙伴却抱着另一种观点。美国不甘心老挝转向中立政策的打算，而开始唆使它的傀儡策划叛乱，反对受到议会和人民信任的政府。为此竟干出了背信弃义的事情来。一方面，美国官方人士口口声声担保美国不反对富马和他领导的政府，而另一方面，由富米·诺萨万指挥的反对合法政府的叛乱，正是在美国的唆使和支持下组织起来的。有人正在尽一切努力来掩饰美国对这位将军的举动的指导作用。但是，美元、武器、弹药源源不断地供给叛徒，美国军事顾问是叛军中的真正主人，这已经不是秘密了。
    苏联政府接着在声明中揭露美国及东南亚侵略集团干涉老挝的种种事实。声明指出，富米·诺萨万在发动叛乱之前，曾到东南亚条约组织司令部所在地的泰国首都曼谷进行秘密谈判。紧接着，泰国政府就提供本国领土，让富米·诺萨万指挥的叛军向老挝首都万象调动。在东南亚条约组织中，正在酝酿使南方各省同老挝分离的计划。泰国和南越当局已命令自己的军队进入战斗准备，并向老挝边境集结。泰国军舰不断挑起军事冲突，接二连三地向老挝船舰和军队射击。
    最近，东南亚条约组织的领导人越来越经常地叫嚷，说什么东南亚条约组织“在老挝行动的时候已经到了”。因此，关于美国向靠近老挝的南中国海派遣航空母舰、驱击舰、载有海军陆战队的运输舰和登陆舰的消息，引起了人们的特别警惕。
    声明强调说，不能不看到，美国及其仆从如泰国、南越等的行动的目的是在老挝挑起内战。这对印度支那和东南亚的和平孕育着危险的后果。老挝事件再一次表明，美国继续沿着建立越来越多的国际紧张局势和冲突的策源地这条危险的道路前进，并且同时侵犯各国人民的民族权利、自由和独立。对古巴的侵略行动、殖民主义者集团在刚果的阴谋、对老挝内政的露骨干涉——所有这一切都是美国政府正在执行的一个政策的各个环节，这个政策就是尽一切力量到处反对亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲各国人民的民族复兴和独立的愿望。
    声明最后说，苏联注视着老挝人民争取自由和民族独立的英勇斗争。苏联政府认为有必要警告美国政府及其东南亚侵略集团的伙伴：它们要对粗暴地破坏1954年日内瓦协议承担严重责任。苏联人民的同情是在爱好自由的老挝人民这一边。
