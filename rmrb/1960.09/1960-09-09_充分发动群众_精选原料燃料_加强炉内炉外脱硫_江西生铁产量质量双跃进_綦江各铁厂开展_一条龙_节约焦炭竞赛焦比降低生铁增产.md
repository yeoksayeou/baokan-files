Xinhua News Agency, Nanchang, 8th: Jiangxi Province's iron and steel industry workers, in the increase production and practice economy movement, have further established the idea of ​​comprehensively fulfilling the state plan with quality and quantity. While striving to increase the output of pig iron from small blast furnaces, the quality of pig iron has also been greatly improved. Recently, the qualification rate of pig iron in many enterprises has risen from 80% to over 90%, better supporting the needs of key steelmaking enterprises.

In the pig iron high-quality and high-yield competition, leading cadres of various steel plants went deep into the front line of production, adhered to putting politics in command, vigorously carried out mass movements, and fiercely tackled pig iron quality. The Party Secretary and Director of Shanggao Steel Plant, when going deep into the furnace side to inspect production, often educated the workers and masses to establish a new atmosphere where everyone cares about product quality. The qualification rate of pig iron in the entire plant has been stable at around 98%. The workers of various enterprises carried forward the spirit of hard struggle, resolutely implemented the policy of "small-scale as the main, indigenous methods as the main", pooled their wisdom and efforts to vigorously carry out technical innovation and technical revolution, made do with whatever was available, took materials locally, and found their own ways to solve the equipment and material problems required for coal washing and coking and various technical measures, ensuring the smooth realization of technical measures. In order to reduce the sulfur content of coking coal, Ji'an Steel Plant changed wood barrel coal washing to long chute coal washing, which not only improved the quality of fine powder but also reduced the labor intensity of workers. Anfu Steel Plant created the operating methods of rapid coking of local coke coal blocks and a new "one-stop" desulfurization method, which improved the yield and quality of coke. These were also achieved without increasing equipment investment and by improving various equipment themselves.

Various enterprises, in response to the high sulfur content of raw materials, fuels, especially fuels, took measures to reduce the sulfur content of ore and coke, and also strengthened the management and testing of raw materials and fuels. On the basis of fully mobilizing the masses, Shanggao Steel Plant adopted eight measures and equipped itself with raw material and fuel quality inspectors, which not only increased the ore grade from about 40% to 70%, but also reduced the coke sulfur content from over 2% to 1%, and the ash content to about 10%. Paishan Steel Plant and Minfa Steel Plant in Guangfeng County strengthened the management and careful selection of raw materials and fuels, and strictly implemented the "three wants and three don'ts" system, that is, raw materials and fuels must be dry, the quality must be good, and the particle size must meet the specifications. Do not pile up ores with inconsistent chemical compositions together, do not pile up ores with inconsistent particle sizes together, and do not pile up raw materials and fuels in the open air. Since August, the qualification rate of pig iron has reached over 96%, and the output has also increased by 30%, achieving a double harvest of high quality and high yield. Ruichang Steel Plant insisted on five checks on ore, keeping the ore grade at 55% to 60%, which not only increased the utilization coefficient of small blast furnaces, but also made the pig iron qualification rate reach over 95.5%.

Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing Electric: After the workers of Qijiang County Iron Plants in Chongqing City quickly launched a "one-stop" coke saving competition, the coke ratio quickly dropped to 0.749 tons, ensuring the continued leap forward in the county's pig iron production.

When discussing production increase and economy practice plans, the workers of Qijiang County Iron Plants all believed that further saving coke was one of the important ways to ensure increased pig iron production. They proposed that if measures were taken to save coke in all links that are in contact with coke, the potential for increasing pig iron production would be great. The Qijiang County Party Committee immediately supported the opinions of the workers and masses, and launched a "one-stop" coke saving competition among the workers of the county's iron smelting plants, from transporting coke, crushing and processing coke, to coke for blast furnaces and other departments.

In the competition, the workers first fully implemented the smelting policy of "strong wind, high temperature, and fine materials". After No. 4 blast furnace of Xinjiezi Iron Plant conscientiously implemented the above policy, the coke ratio decreased significantly, and the output rose steadily, and the average utilization coefficient quickly reached 1.438%. Secondly, they vigorously grasped the savings in the links of coke transportation, crushing and processing. The transportation department of Xiaoyutuo Iron Plant handled coke gently to reduce broken coke; the crushing and processing department changed hand-hammering coke to knife-chopping coke, and these two items alone saved 8% of coke. Xinjiezi Iron Plant newly built a railway branch line from the railway station to the blast furnace, reducing a transportation and loading and unloading link, which can save more than 5%-8% of coke. In addition, the workers also made full use of coke powder and ore powder to vigorously produce coke balls and sintered ore, which also reduced coke consumption. (Attached picture)

The First Steelmaking Plant of Taiyuan Iron and Steel Company has formed a three-in-one performance troupe, specializing in the main key in production - shortening the smelting time. Now, the average smelting time per furnace in the plant has been shortened by two hours compared with the original. This is the performance troupe at the pre-opening meeting.

    充分发动群众　精选原料燃料　加强炉内炉外脱硫
    江西生铁产量质量双跃进
    綦江各铁厂开展“一条龙”节约焦炭竞赛焦比降低生铁增产
    新华社南昌8日电　江西省钢铁工业职工在增产节约运动中，进一步树立按质按量全面完成国家计划的思想，在努力提高小高炉生铁产量的同时，生铁质量也有了更大的提高。最近以来，不少企业的生铁合格率由80％上升到90％以上，更好地支援了重点企业炼钢的需要。
    在生铁优质高产竞赛中，各钢铁厂领导干部深入生产第一线，坚持政治挂帅、大搞群众运动，猛攻生铁质量。上高钢铁厂党委书记、厂长在深入炉边检查生产时，经常对职工群众进行教育，树立人人关心产品质量的新风气，全厂生铁合格率一直稳定在98％左右。各企业职工发扬艰苦奋斗的精神，坚决贯彻“以小为主，以土为主”的方针，群策群力大闹技术革新和技术革命，因陋就简，就地取材，自行设法解决了洗煤炼焦以及各项技术措施所需要的设备材料问题，保证了技术措施的顺利实现。吉安钢铁厂为了降低焦煤含硫量，把木桶洗煤改为长溜槽洗煤，既提高了精粉质量，又减轻了工人劳动强度。安福钢铁厂创造土焦煤块速炼焦和新法“一条龙”脱硫的操作方法，提高了焦炭的产量和质量，这些也是在不增加设备投资、自己动手改进各项设备的情况下实现的。
    各企业针对原料、燃料特别是燃料含硫高的情况，采取措施降低矿石和焦炭的含硫量，同时加强了对原料、燃料的管理和化验工作。上高钢铁厂在充分发动群众的基础上，采取八项措施，配备了原料、燃料质量检验员，不仅使矿石品位由40％左右提高到70％，而且使焦炭含硫量由2％以上降低到1％，灰分降低到10％左右。广丰县排山钢铁厂和民发钢铁厂加强了对原料、燃料的管理和精选工作，严格执行“三要三不要”的制度，即原料燃料要干，质量要好，粒度要合规格，不要把化学成分不一的矿石堆放在一起，不要把粒度不一的矿石堆放在一起，不要把原料、燃料堆放在露天。8月份以来，生铁合格率都达到96％以上，产量也随之提高30％，获得了优质高产双丰收。瑞昌钢铁厂坚持矿石过五关，使矿石品位保持在55％到60％，不仅提高了小高炉利用系数，而且使生铁合格率达到95.5％以上。
    新华社重庆电　重庆市綦江县各铁厂职工迅速开展了“一条龙”节约焦炭的竞赛以后，焦比很快下降到零点七四九吨，保证了全县生铁生产持续跃进。
    綦江县各铁厂职工在讨论增产节约计划的时候，都认为进一步节约焦炭是保证增产生铁的重要途径之一。他们提出，如果在凡是同焦炭有接触的各个环节上，都采取措施节约焦炭，增产生铁的潜力就很大。中共綦江县委马上支持了职工群众的意见，在全县炼铁厂职工中，发起了一个从运输焦炭、破碎加工焦炭，一直到高炉用焦等部门的“一条龙”节约焦炭的竞赛。
    在竞赛中，职工们首先全面贯彻了“大风、高温、精料”的冶炼方针。新街子铁厂四号高炉认真贯彻了以上的方针以后，焦比显著下降，产量节节上升，平均利用系数很快达到了1.438％。其次，狠抓焦炭运输、破碎加工环节的节约。小鱼沱铁厂运输部门运焦炭时轻拿轻放，减少了碎焦；破碎加工部门改手捶破焦为砍刀破焦，只此两项就节约了焦炭8％。新街子铁厂从火车站到高炉新修一条铁路岔道，减少了一道运输装卸环节，可节约焦炭5％—8％以上。此外，职工们还充分利用焦末、矿粉大搞焦球和烧结矿，也降低了焦炭消耗。（附图片）
