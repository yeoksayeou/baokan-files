Xinhua News Agency, Ottawa, 23rd: The Chinese Art Troupe, currently on a performance tour in Canada, arrived in Ottawa, the Canadian capital, on the 19th after concluding its performances in Toronto. Among those who welcomed them at the station were Stounikov, the Soviet Chargé d'Affaires in Canada, diplomatic envoys from Czechoslovakia, Poland, and other countries, as well as Canadian friends and local overseas Chinese.

　　On the evening of their arrival, the Soviet Embassy held a grand reception to welcome all members of the Chinese Art Troupe. In attendance were prominent figures from all walks of life in the Canadian capital, as well as diplomatic envoys to Canada from many countries in Asia, Africa, Latin America, and Europe.

　　The Chinese Art Troupe's performances in Toronto caused a sensation in this commercial and cultural center of Canada. Local major newspapers unanimously considered the performances to be "first-class," "remarkable, unparalleled." Canada's largest newspaper, "The Globe and Mail," said that because these performances offered an entirely different traditional repertoire of excellence at our main theater, we saw a completely new world of drama. Many newspapers highly praised the plots of "The Tale of the White Snake" and "Wild Boar Forest." These two operas achieved astonishing success.

　　Many in the audience came from the United States, including overseas Chinese, who watched the performances with great interest. An elderly American woman from Buffalo was moved to tears after watching the performance, and she went backstage to say to the Chinese artists, "We are your true friends." She also presented her souvenirs to the Chinese artists.

　　In addition to formal performances, the art troupe also gave a performance for the sick children at the Winnipeg Children's Hospital (the largest children's hospital in North America). The art troupe's compassionate act was well-received by the Canadian press.

　　Prominent local figures, including Mr. Duncan, Mr. Gordon, and Mrs. Fairley, who had visited China, held warm receptions for the art troupe in their homes. In addition, the art troupe also held cordial conversations with prominent figures in the local cultural and artistic circles, and participated in a grand banquet with five hundred people held by the Canadian Ukrainian Federation for the art troupe, as well as a banquet held by overseas Chinese for the art troupe.

　　加拿大舆论盛赞我国艺术团演出
　  我艺术团在多伦多演出后到达渥太华
    据新华社23日讯　渥太华消息：正在加拿大访问演出的中国艺术团，在结束了多伦多的访问演出后，19日到达加拿大首都渥太华。到车站欢迎的有苏联驻加拿大代办斯托乌尼科夫、捷克斯洛伐克、波兰等国外交使节以及加拿大朋友和当地华侨。
    在到达的当晚，苏联大使馆举行盛大的招待会，欢迎中国艺术团全体人员。到会的有加拿大首都各界的一些著名人士，亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲和欧洲许多国家驻加拿大的外交使节。
    中国艺术团在多伦多的演出轰动了加拿大的这个工商文化中心。当地各家大报一致认为，演出是
  “第一流的”、“了不起、无与伦比的”。加拿大最大的报纸“环球邮报”说，由于这些表演在我国主要的剧院提供了一种完全不同的传统的优秀剧目，我们看到了完全新的戏剧天地。许多报纸盛赞“白蛇传”和“野猪林”的情节。这两出戏获得了惊人的成功。
    观众中间很多人来自美国，其中也有华侨，他们怀着最大的兴趣观看了表演。布法罗的一位美国老太太在观看了表演以后感动得流了泪，她到后台向中国艺术家说，“我们是你们真正的朋友。”并且把自己的纪念品赠送给中国艺术家。
    艺术团除了正式演出外，还为温尼泊儿童医院（北美最大的儿童医院）的患病儿童作了慰问演出。艺术团的这种慈爱举动得到加拿大报界的好评。
    当地著名人士，包括曾经访问过中国的邓肯先生、戈登先生、费尔利夫人等都在自己家里为艺术团举行了热情的招待会。此外，艺术团还同当地的文化和艺术界著名人士进行了亲切的交谈，参加了当地的加拿大籍乌克兰人联合会为艺术团举行的有五百人参加的盛大宴会以及华侨为艺术团举行的宴会。
