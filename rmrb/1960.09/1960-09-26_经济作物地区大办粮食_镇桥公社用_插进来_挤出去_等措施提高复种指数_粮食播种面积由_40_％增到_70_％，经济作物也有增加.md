Our Nanchang dispatch of the 25th: In the twelve production brigades in the economic crop area of Zhenqiao Commune, Leping County, Jiangxi, various measures were taken to vigorously develop grain production, so that the grain sown area increased from 40% of the original planting area to 70%, and the area of economic crops also increased.

The twelve production brigades in the economic crop area of Zhenqiao Commune have a total of more than 30,550 mu of cultivated land and a population of more than 21,000, with an average of 1.4 mu of land per person. Among the more than 30,000 mu of cultivated land, the area of economic crops used to account for more than 18,000 mu, and grain crops only accounted for more than 12,000 mu. Therefore, the state needed to supply more than 3.9 million jin of grain every year. In order to implement the spirit of taking grain as the key link, these brigades launched a discussion on developing grain production by the whole party and the whole people. The broad masses of commune members put forward an all-round great leap forward plan that would not only allow grain crops to take the lead in economic crop areas, but also develop economic crop production. The specific methods are: to insert grain crops into economic crops, to squeeze the non-state-planned economic crops that occupy basic farmland to the mountains, and to adjust grain crops to basic farmland; in addition, these brigades also reclaimed new fields to increase the area of grain crops and economic crops, and solve the contradiction between economic crops and grain crops competing for land. In this way, the land utilization rate was greatly improved, and more than 10,000 mu reached three crops a year, 15,000 mu changed from three crops a year to four crops a year, and more than 5,500 mu changed to five crops a year, thus turning grain-deficient areas into grain-surplus areas.

The twelve production brigades have the following measures to vigorously develop grain production in economic crop areas: First, insert crops. The difficulty encountered by the twelve production brigades in arranging autumn grain planting was that more than 30,000 mu of land was occupied by autumn crops such as rapeseed, radish, and safflower seeds, and summer crops such as yellow millet, sweet potatoes, cotton, and peppers. The so-called insertion is to intercrop wheat between rows of economic crops such as cotton and peppers. Since wheat only emerges and grows after the previous crop is harvested, the contradiction between the growth of the two crops is resolved. After the economic crops are harvested, safflower seeds and Chinese cabbage are intercropped between the rows of wheat, thus finding planting areas for economic crops again, making one mu of land equal to several mu of use. The second is to squeeze out crops. Zhenqiao Commune also has thirteen brigades that mainly produce grain crops. Because these areas only grow grain, the economic income is relatively small. In order to balance economic income, the commune decided to squeeze out safflower seeds, rapeseed, and summer peppers, sweet melons, and other economic crops that are not included in the state plan but have low technical requirements, and arrange them in grain-producing areas. This not only freed up more than 2,500 mu of area for grain crops in economic crop areas, but also increased the economic income of grain crop areas, so that the economic income of these two types of areas was balanced. Adjusting land and building new grain production bases are also two important measures for economic crop areas to vigorously develop grain production. In the past, these twelve production brigades planted miscellaneous grains and even some rice in non-basic farmland. On the contrary, melon crops were planted in basic farmland. In order to change this unreasonable planting method, Zhenqiao Commune conducted comprehensive planning. According to the principle of taking grain as the key link and taking into account cotton, hemp, and oil, the peppers planted in basic farmland were transferred to the graves, and the vegetables were transferred to the foundation of houses. Through the adjustment of seven crops, 500 mu of grain crops were added to the good fields. In addition to using small plots of land such as field ridges, front and back of villages, roadsides, river beaches, dry ponds, and both sides of canals to grow miscellaneous grain crops such as sorghum, corn, and beans, these twelve production brigades in the economic crop area also formed a mechanized farming team to open up more than 3,300 mu of new grain and economic crop production bases in the mountains and islands.

After adopting the above measures, the land utilization rate of these production brigades has been greatly improved. The planting area of grain crops has greatly increased, and the area of economic crops has also expanded, ensuring the comprehensive implementation of the production policy of taking grain as the key link.

　　经济作物地区大办粮食
　  镇桥公社用“插进来”“挤出去”等措施提高复种指数
　　粮食播种面积由40％增到70％，经济作物也有增加
    本报南昌25日电　江西乐平县镇桥公社十二个经济作物地区的生产大队，采取多种措施大办粮食生产，使粮食播种面积由占原有种植面积的40％增加到70％，经济作物面积也有增加。
    镇桥公社十二个经济作物地区的生产大队，共有三万零五百五十多亩耕地，二万一千多人口，每人平均有地一亩四分。在三万多亩耕地中，过去经济作物面积占一万八千多亩，粮食作物仅有一万二千多亩，因此每年需要国家供应的粮食达三百九十多万斤。为了贯彻执行以粮为纲的精神，这些大队开展了全党全民大办粮食的讨论，广大社员提出了既让粮食作物在经济作物地区挂帅，又发展经济作物生产的全面跃进计划。具体办法是：让粮食作物插到经济作物中来，把占用基本农田的一部分非国家计划的经济作物挤到山上去，把粮食作物调整到基本农田里来；此外这些大队还开垦新田增加粮食作物和经济作物的面积，解决经济作物与粮食作物争田的矛盾。这样，土地利用率就大大提高，并有一万多亩达到了三种三收，一万五千亩由三种三收变为四种四收，五千五百多亩变为五种五收，从而使缺粮地区变为余粮地区。
    这十二个生产大队在经济作物地区大办粮食的措施有以下几条：一是插进来。十二个生产大队在安排秋种粮食时所遇到的困难，是三万多亩地被油菜、萝卜、红花籽等秋播作物和黄粟、红薯、棉花、辣椒等夏种作物占用。所谓插进来，就是在棉花、辣椒等经济作物行间套种小麦。由于小麦在上季作物收割后才出土生长，解决了两季作物生长中的矛盾。经济作物收割后，再在麦子行间套种红花籽、白菜，从而又为经济作物找到了种植面积，使一亩田顶了几亩用。二是挤出去。镇桥公社还有十三个以生产粮食作物为主的大队，因为这些地区只种粮食，经济收入较少。为平衡经济收入，公社决定把经济作物地区未列入国家计划、而技术要求又不太高的红花籽、油菜和夏种辣椒、甜瓜等经济作物挤出去，安排到主产粮的地区，从而既为经济作物地区的粮食作物腾出二千五百多亩面积，又增加了粮食作物地区的经济收入，使这两种地区经济收入得到平衡发展。调整土地与新建粮食生产基地，也是经济作物地区大办粮食的两项重要措施。这十二个生产大队过去都把杂粮甚至一部分水稻种在非基本农田里，相反把瓜类作物种在基本农田内。为改变这种不合理的种法，镇桥公社进行了全面规划，根据以粮为纲，兼顾棉、麻、油的原则，把基本农田内种的辣椒调上坟坪，蔬菜调上屋基。通过七项作物的调整，在好田内增种了五百亩粮食作物。这十二个经济作物地区的生产大队，除利用田塍、村前屋后、路旁河滩、干涸池塘和渠道两岸的小块田大种高粱、玉米、豆类等杂粮作物外，还组成一个机耕队伍，到山上和洲地新开了三千三百多亩粮食与经济作物的生产基地。
    采用上述措施后，这些生产大队土地利用率大大提高。粮食作物种植面积大大增加，经济作物面积也有扩大，保证了以粮为纲的生产方针全面执行。
