　　Water Storage for Drought Prevention
      “Store in autumn, irrigate in winter, fight spring drought,” this is an important lesson our people have summarized in their long struggle to conquer nature. Autumn floods and spring droughts are characteristic of the climate in most parts of our country. Especially in some areas of the Yellow River and Huai River basins, the rainfall in the three months of July, August, and September generally accounts for more than half of the annual rainfall; from October to March of the following year, the rainfall often accounts for only one-tenth or two-tenths of the annual rainfall, and sometimes there is basically no rain. Under these circumstances, storing the excess rainwater in autumn and using it when there is a lack of rain in spring is truly a win-win solution for both drainage and drought prevention.
    Some areas in North China and Southwest China are still experiencing drought. According to weather forecasts, the lower reaches of the Yellow River may continue to have little rain this winter and next spring. These areas have experienced continuous drought for two years, last year and this year, and the water stored in the soil is already very low, making continued drought prevention particularly important. Since this summer and autumn, various regions have combined flood prevention and drainage with rainwater storage, achieving great results. However, from a national perspective, the existing water storage capacity is only 40% of the water storage capacity of various water conservancy projects; it is estimated that only about half of the water that has been stored can be used for irrigation; moreover, the water storage situation varies from place to place, and the drier the area and the greater the need for water, the relatively less water is stored. In order to prevent possible spring droughts next year and strive for a summer harvest that is much better than in previous years, we must make persistent efforts to store more water.
    Our ancestors summarized the valuable experience of storing water for drought prevention, but due to various limitations, they could not fully apply these experiences to the struggle against nature. Since the Great Leap Forward, under the brilliant light of the Party's General Line for Socialist Construction, relying on the powerful strength of the people's communes, tens of thousands of large, medium, and small-sized water storage projects have been built across the country, and the capacity to store floodwater has increased exponentially. This is the most favorable condition for doing a good job in water storage. Now is the rainy season in autumn, and it is also the end of the flood season, so the task of flood prevention is relatively small, and water storage is more convenient. The ancients described the people in the northwest who have little rain and many mountains as being able to "use every drop of water, and cultivate diligently even on the highest mountains" in order to develop agriculture. We should carry forward this spirit, and under the premise of ensuring flood control safety, we should try every means to store and conserve water. It takes less effort, lower costs, and greater results to store water now; if we do not store surface water now, and then dig for groundwater when a drought occurs, it will not only require more labor and higher costs, but also take longer to see results, which will not alleviate the urgent need.
    Combining flood prevention with water storage for future use involves dealing with floods, so it must be done with caution and care. The agricultural and water conservancy leadership organs in various regions should carefully analyze the autumn rainfall situation in their respective regions, analyze the specific situation of each reservoir, and determine the water storage standards and timing accordingly. For those reservoirs where the engineering is reliable, water should be stored as much as possible and as early as possible; for those reservoirs where the engineering is incomplete but the workload is not large, active repairs and supplementary work should be carried out in an effort to store water in the autumn; for those reservoirs where the engineering is unreliable and the remaining workload is large, water may not be stored for the time being or only a small amount of water may be stored. In short, on the one hand, we must prevent one-sided emphasis on flood prevention and neglect of water storage and conservation; on the other hand, we must prevent blind efforts to store water without making specific analyses and without considering the actual conditions of the reservoirs. When storing water, we must focus on large and medium-sized projects, as well as small-sized projects, and make full use of all ponds, reservoirs, dams, weirs, rivers, and fields that can store water. In order to do a good job in water storage, the agricultural and water conservancy departments in various regions must cooperate closely, strengthen leadership, designate special personnel, and assign areas of responsibility to ensure accountability; at the same time, they must strengthen weather forecasting and flood prevention preparations, and make adjustments to storage and discharge at any time according to climate changes. After the water is stored, work such as engineering support and land leveling must be carried out in order to get the water from the reservoirs and ponds to the fields and put it to use.
    Water is the lifeblood of agriculture. With enough water, we can overcome drought and ensure a bumper harvest. In this sense, water is grain, and water storage is collecting grain. This is a major event related to the overall situation of agricultural production next year, and it must be done well and must not be taken lightly.

### 蓄水防旱

　　蓄水防旱
      “秋蓄，冬灌，抗春旱”，这是我国人民在长期的征服自然的斗争中总结出来的一条重要经验。秋涝春旱，是我国大部地区气候的特点。特别是黄河和淮河流域一些地区，7、8、9三个月的降雨量一般占全年降雨量的一半以上；从10月到来年3月的半年中，降雨量往往仅占全年降雨量的十分之一、二，有时甚至基本无雨。在这种情况下，把秋季多余的雨水蓄存起来，到春季缺雨时用，实在是排涝、防旱的两全之道。
    华北、西南部分地区，仍然继续干旱。据气象预报，黄河下游地区，今冬明春还可能持续少雨。去年和今年，这些地区连续旱了两年，土壤中存蓄的水分已经很少，继续防旱显得特别重要。今年夏秋以来，各地结合防汛、排涝，拦蓄雨水，取得了很大的成绩。但是，从全国情况来看，现有的蓄水量仅仅达到各种水利工程蓄水能力的40％；已经蓄积的水，能够用于灌溉的，估计只有一半左右；而且，各地蓄水的情况是不平衡的，越是干旱需水的地方，蓄水量越是相对地少。为了预防明年可能发生的春旱，争取一个比往年好得多的夏收，我们必须再接再厉，拦蓄更多的水。
    我们的先人总结了蓄水防旱的宝贵经验，可是，由于各种条件的限制，他们不可能把这些经验充分运用到对自然的斗争中去。大跃进以来，在党的社会主义建设总路线光辉照耀下，依靠人民公社的强大力量，在全国各地修建了数以万计的大、中、小型蓄水工程，拦蓄洪水的能力成倍地提高，这是做好蓄水工作的最有利的条件。现在正是秋季多雨季节，又是汛期末季，防汛任务比较小了，蓄水更加方便了。古人形容西北少雨多山地区的人民，为了发展农业，能使“水无涓滴不为用，山到崔嵬犹力耕”。我们应该发扬这种精神，在保证防洪安全的前提下，想尽一切方法，努力蓄水保水。现在蓄水用力少，成本低，效果大；如果现在不拦蓄地上水，而在发生旱象的时候，再去发掘地下水，不仅用工多，成本高，而且收效较慢，缓不济急。
    结合防汛蓄水备用，是跟洪水打交道，要很谨慎，很小心。各地农业、水利领导机关应该认真分析本地区秋季降雨的情况，分析每个水库的具体情况，据以确定蓄水的标准和时间。对那些工程有把握的水库，应当尽可能多蓄水，早蓄水；对那些工程配套不全而工作量又不大的水库，应当积极进行整修、配套，争取秋季能蓄上水；对那些工程没有把握而遗留的工作量又很大的水库，可以暂不蓄水或少蓄水。总之，一方面要防止片面强调防汛，忽视蓄水保水；一方面又要防止不作具体分析，不根据水库的实际情况，盲目争取蓄水。蓄水的时候，既要抓大、中型工程，也要抓小型工程，凡是能蓄水的塘、库、坝、堰、河、田，都要充分利用起来。为了做好蓄水工作，各地农业、水利部门要密切合作，加强领导，指定专人，划片包干，负责到底；同时要加强气象预报和防汛准备工作，根据气候变化，随时进行蓄泄调剂。把水拦蓄起来，接着要进行工程配套、平整土地等工作，这才能把库塘里的水送到田里，让它发挥作用。
    水是农业的命脉。有了足够的水，就能战胜干旱，保证丰收。从这个意义上说，水就是粮食，蓄水就是收积粮食。这是关系明年农业生产全局的大事，必须保证作好，绝对不能等闲视之。
