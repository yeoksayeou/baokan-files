    All Sectors in Tibet Fully Support the Autumn Harvest
    Farm tool factory workers rush to produce autumn harvest tools day and night; transportation departments ensure that farm tools are transported as soon as they arrive; the People's Liberation Army, government cadres, and urban residents organize manpower to support the autumn harvest; meteorological staff are also determined to act as the "eyes and ears" of the peasants for the autumn harvest.
    Xinhua News Agency, Lhasa. The autumn harvest season in the Tibetan plateau is about to begin in full swing. This is the first year of bumper harvest for the emancipated peasants after the democratic reforms in Tibet. All sectors across the region have taken urgent action and adopted various measures to fully support the autumn harvest.

    The Tibet Military Region of the Chinese People's Liberation Army has issued a notice to help the Tibetan people with the autumn harvest, requiring all stationed troops to quickly support local people with manpower, materials, and technology. Government cadres, urban residents, and students throughout the region have also begun to organize autumn harvest teams to go to the countryside in batches.

    From Xiadong and Garze to the transportation line of more than 1,000 kilometers within Tibet, the transportation departments have taken urgent measures to quickly allocate and transport autumn harvest tools and other means of production. Farm tools are generally transported as soon as they arrive. After the farm tools are transported to Lhasa, the Tibet Trade Corporation quickly dispatches them to the countryside by automobiles, horse carts, and yak-hide boats. Since July, more than thirty kinds of autumn harvest and other production tools, totaling more than 73,700 pieces, including sickles, wool shears, and shovels, have been transferred to various places, and more than 70,000 pieces of farm tools for autumn harvest are still being transported.

    All the workers of the newly established comprehensive farm tool factory in Lhasa and the iron and wood factory of the Municipal Bureau of Industry and Commerce are rushing to produce autumn harvest tools day and night. They have already produced 10,400 sickles and a large number of forks, rakes, windmills, hoes, threshers, etc. The Lhasa Comprehensive Farm Tool Factory has also produced more than 40,000 ball bearings and more than 500 sets of bearings for farmers to manufacture various vehicles before and after the autumn harvest.

    Handicraft workers in cities and villages in various places have also organized themselves to trial-produce new farm tools. Many places have newly built farm tool factories or farm tool repair shops. In Duilongdeqing County in the Lhasa area alone, nineteen large and small comprehensive farm tool factories have been established. While producing autumn harvest tools, urban handicraft workers have also organized mobile repair teams to repair farm tools for farmers in the fields.

    Meteorological staff in various parts of Tibet are determined to act as the "eyes and ears" of the peasants for the autumn harvest, and have organized investigation teams to go deep into the countryside to study the weather conditions during the autumn harvest with veteran farmers and make timely weather forecasts. The Tibet Meteorological Bureau recently sent four working groups to meteorological stations at all levels to strengthen the work of grass-roots stations.

    Medical personnel in various places have also organized mobile medical teams for the autumn harvest, preparing to help farmers with the autumn harvest while providing on-site medical treatment. Some local folk doctors are also actively participating in the work of the medical teams.

    迎接民主改革后的第一个丰收年
    西藏各行各业全力支援秋收
    农具厂职工日夜赶制秋收工具；交通部门保证农具随到随运；解放军、机关干部和城市居民组织人力支援秋收；气象工作人员也决心为农民当好秋收的“耳目”。
    新华社拉萨电　西藏高原秋收季节即将全面开始，这是西藏民主改革后翻身农民的第一个丰收年。全区各个行业已紧张行动起来，采取各种措施，全力支援秋收。
    中国人民解放军西藏军区已发出帮助藏族人民秋收的通知，要求各驻地部队迅速以人力、物力和技术支援当地群众。全区的机关干部、城市居民和学生也已开始组织秋收大队分批下乡。
    从峡东、噶尔穆直到西藏境内一千多公里的运输线上，交通运输部门采取了快调快运秋收工具和其他生产资料的紧急措施，调运农具一般都是随到随送。农具运到拉萨后，西藏贸易总公司便用汽车、马车、牛皮船等很快调往农村。7月份以来，调到各地的镰刀、羊毛剪、铁锹等秋收和其他生产工具三十多种，共七万三千七百多件，还有七万余件秋收秋打的农具正在继续调运。
    拉萨市新成立的综合农具厂和市工商处的铁木工厂全体职工，正日夜赶制秋收工具，已生产出一万零四百把镰刀和大量的杈、耙、风车、锄头、脱粒机等。拉萨综合农具厂还生产了四万多颗滚珠和五百多套轴承，供农民在秋收前后制造各种车子。
    各地城市和农村的手工业工人也纷纷组织起来，试制新农具，许多地方都新建了农具厂或农具修配厂，仅拉萨地区堆龙德庆县就建立十九个大小综合农具厂。城市手工业工人在生产秋收工具的同时，还组织了巡回修理小组，到地头田间为农民修理农具。
    西藏各地的气象工作人员，决心为农民当好秋收的“耳目”，纷纷组织调查组深入农村，与老农共同研究秋收期间的天气情况，及时作出气象预报。西藏气象处最近还派出四个工作组到各级气象站，加强基层台、站工作。
    各地医务人员也组织秋收巡回医疗组，准备一边帮助农民秋收，一边在现场为农民治病，一些当地的民间医生也积极参加医疗组的工作。
