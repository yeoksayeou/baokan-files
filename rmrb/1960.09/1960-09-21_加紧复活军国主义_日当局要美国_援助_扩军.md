Intensifying the Revival of Militarism
　　Japanese Authorities Seek U.S. "Aid" for Military Expansion

Xinhua News Agency, 17th: Tokyo dispatch: The Administrative Vice-Minister of the "Defense Agency" of the Japanese Ikeda government, Hisashi Imai, met yesterday with the U.S. military "aid" delegation led by General Williston B. Palmer, requesting the United States to continue to "aid" Japan in expanding its military.

The purpose of this U.S. delegation, which arrived in Japan on September 15th, is to investigate the equipment situation of the Japanese army in order to make recommendations to the U.S. government on the amount of military "aid" to be provided to Japan in the 1961 fiscal year.

According to newspaper reports, Imai explained to Palmer that the Japanese government is preparing to "modernize" the equipment of the Japanese army and increase the number of troops.

Xinhua News Agency, 19th: Tokyo dispatch: Japanese military authorities have decided to send an investigation team to the United States to study and purchase "air defense" equipment.

According to today's "Sankei Shimbun" report, the "Defense Agency" has decided to follow the example of the United States and establish a semi-automatic ground surveillance and control network throughout Japan. The newspaper revealed that the "Defense Agency" has already begun consultations with relevant U.S. authorities on the purchase of relevant machinery, and hopes to use U.S. military "aid" funds to pay for most of the required expenses.
