    Zhi Shunyi is a national special-class combat hero and a close comrade-in-arms of Dong Cunrui during his lifetime. In the spring of 1948, during the Battle of Longhua, he and Dong Cunrui were always at the forefront. He also covered Dong Cunrui's heroic sacrifice to destroy the enemy's bunker, ensuring that the troops quickly captured the city and annihilated the enemy. Now, this old hero serves as the deputy director of the management section in a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army, where he demonstrates an extraordinary heroic style in an ordinary position.

      Ordinary and Extraordinary

    Management work is trivial and complicated, covering everything from the clothing, food, housing, and transportation of officers and soldiers to their personal hygiene. Since Zhi Shunyi came to the management section in 1956, he has managed these tasks in an orderly and excellent manner. People often use this sentence to praise him: Our old hero, manages everything from astronomy to geography, from washing clothes to washing rice, he is our role model everywhere. Wang Liyuan, who used to be an accountant in the management section, once complained that management work was troublesome and ordinary and requested a transfer. After Zhi Shunyi arrived, he saw that this nationally renowned hero not only did not dislike the trouble, but instead looked for more "troublesome" things to do. He was very moved and talked to the deputy director. Zhi Shunyi said to him kindly: "Revolutionaries can't be picky about their work. No matter how difficult or troublesome the work is, we must do it with all our energy!"

    Zhi Shunyi has always led by example and taken the lead in his work. People often find him either helping the kitchen staff pick vegetables and wash rice, or helping to warm food and remove manure in the pigsty; either counting materials in the warehouse, or running to the vegetable garden to help irrigate and weed... He said that if a leading cadre does not enthusiastically do concrete work, he cannot discover problems in time, and it is inconvenient to discuss and solve problems with everyone quickly. In early winter last year, there was a heavy snowfall, and the pigsty was leaking a bit. He discussed with the breeder that the wet pig bed could easily affect the health of the pigs, and they would clean it up after the snow stopped to prevent snow from accumulating on the roof. Later, the breeder forgot about it. However, the pigsty roof was clean every time it snowed. The breeder knew that Zhi Shunyi had cleaned it and was very moved. After that, he strengthened the feeding management. Now, this pig farm has become an advanced unit without swine fever.

    Once, the troops went out for exercises. When they set off, he considered that there were not many people in the command post, so he only brought one cook. Later, the number of people increased, and the leaders and comrades all said to him with concern: With such a large workload, how can you and a cook handle it? Let's transfer another person! He said: "Everyone is busy now, I'll discuss it with the cook, and we can probably handle it." Immediately, he found the cook, Yuan Junliang, and said: "Old Yuan, you and I are both Communist Party members. Can we handle this whole show, singing and acting, ourselves?" So, the two of them worked hard in the grassland for two whole months. He bought vegetables, cooked meals, and entertained visitors, working until late at night every day.

    Zhi Shunyi cherishes every thread and stitch of public property. When walking, he often pays attention to searching for trivial things that people don't care about. Whether it is a nail, a piece of iron sheet, or a piece of wood, as long as he encounters it, he will pick it up. When he picked up a lot of things, he sent them to the warehouse. He said: "Don't look down on it because it's broken, it's all the blood and sweat of the working people, and it's good if it's useful. In the past hard years, Comrade Dong Cunrui would pick up a piece of broken leather or a wisp of hemp during marching. When camping, he would use these things to repair shoes for the soldiers, otherwise, they would not be able to continue marching and fighting. Now, although we are bigger and richer, we must not be extravagant." Over the years, he has picked up many abandoned materials, saving the country a lot of expenses. Many people said with emotion: "Deputy Section Chief Zhi Shunyi is truly an old hero who never fades!"

      Selflessness and Altruism

    Since Dong Cunrui's heroic sacrifice, Zhi Shunyi has often said that the reason why Dong Cunrui was able to sacrifice himself to blow up the enemy's bunker for the sake of the overall situation and the victory of the battle was because of his infinite loyalty to the revolutionary cause. He always takes Dong Cunrui as an example, always focusing on the collective and thinking of others first, never calculating his own gains and losses.

    This spring, the troops were going to build a fish pond. Because of the lack of tools and the small construction site, the construction troops could not work at the same time and had to work in three shifts every day. At that time, all the cadres were concentrating on studying culture. Zhi Shunyi thought: Studying culture is a major event, and drawing one more person will affect one person's studies. So, he volunteered to lead this work. In fact, he urgently needed to study culture even more. He had not read a single book before joining the army, and now he can only write letters and read documents. But he didn't think about these things, he only felt that taking care of more people's studies was much more important than his own studies.

    It is said that one person commanding three shifts of work, following one or two shifts of labor every day is already a lot, but he built a small shed at the construction site and worked with the soldiers in all three shifts every day. He knew that the new soldiers had no blasting experience, so he led them in setting explosives, taking on the dangerous work himself to avoid accidents for the soldiers. He saw that the soldiers were very tired from work, and after the break, he took the time to repair the soil baskets when he could not repair tools. People saw that he hardly got six hours of sleep a day and often advised him to get off work early and rest more. He said: "One person's rest is a small matter, the work of the entire construction site is a major matter." For the sake of the entire construction site, he worked tirelessly with everyone.

    Several times, he woke up in the middle of the night and suddenly got up and walked out when he heard the sound of wind and rain outside. His wife asked him where he was going? He always said "Something to do" as usual. In the rain, he walked all over the barracks, closing the doors and windows that were not closed tightly, and putting away the things that were not put away. Usually, he always goes to bed after others, closing the doors and windows that others have not closed, tightening the faucets that others have not tightened, and turning off the lights that should be turned off, and then goes to sleep peacefully.

        The Virtue of Humility

    During the Liberation War, Zhi Shunyi fought north and south and made contributions to the people. After the liberation of North China, from the southward march, the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea to the present, he has been commended almost every year and praised in everything he does. The Party and the state have given him lofty honors. He is a recipient of the Mao Zedong Medal, a representative to the National Congress of Combat Heroes, and a model Communist Party member. In his unit, from leaders to soldiers, everyone calls him "Old Hero." During festivals, many local authorities and schools invite him to give reports; every month, dozens of letters come from all over the country, expressing their determination to make progress to the hero.

    Zhi Shunyi has a very correct understanding of the honors given to him by the Party, the country, and the masses. He has said to people more than once: "This is by no means my personal honor. Without the strength of the Party and the masses, what can I do alone!"

    Once, a unit invited him to give a report. When the officers and soldiers heard the news that the hero was coming to the unit, they cleaned the barracks, put up slogans, and prepared to welcome him with gongs and drums the next day. However, Zhi Shunyi took the train the night before and arrived at the station in the middle of the night. At this time, he could have found a hotel near the station to stay in and then go to the unit that invited him the next morning. But he still walked to the barracks far from the station overnight, as he did every time he went out. When he entered the duty room, he saw that the duty officer was asleep, so he quietly lay down on a long bench with his clothes on and fell asleep. When the duty officer discovered Zhi Shunyi in the morning, he was so moved that he held his hand and didn't know what to say: "Oh, old hero, we were just preparing to welcome you, why didn't you call me when you came?" Zhi Shunyi said: "This is good, you rested, I also rested, and it also saves everyone time and doesn't affect training."

### 永不褪色的老英雄

    永不褪色的老英雄	新华社记者　佟希文
    郅顺义是全国特级战斗英雄，董存瑞生前的亲密战友。1948年春天隆化战斗中，他和董存瑞两人一直冲在最前面，以后又掩护董存瑞舍身炸毁了敌人的碉堡，保证了部队迅速攻进城内，全歼了敌人。现在，这位老英雄在解放军某部任管理科副科长，在平凡的岗位上他又表现出不平凡的英雄风格。
      平凡与不平凡
    管理工作琐碎、繁杂，部队官兵的衣食住行以至个人卫生几乎都得管到。郅顺义从1956年到管理科以来，把这些工作管得有条不紊，样样都好。人们最愿用这句话来称赞他：我们的老英雄，上管天文地理，下管洗衣淘米，处处是我们的表率。原来在管理科当会计的王立元，曾经嫌过管理工作麻烦、平凡，要求调动工作。郅顺义来了以后，他看到这位全国闻名的英雄，不仅不嫌麻烦，反而去找更多的“麻烦”事情做，他很感动，找副科长谈，郅顺义亲切地对他说：“干革命可不能挑肥拣瘦，不论是多么艰险，多么麻烦的工作，都要以自己的全部精力作好它！”
    郅顺义在工作中，一向是以身作则，身先士卒。人们常常发现他不是帮助伙房摘菜、淘米，就是在猪棚里帮着温食、起粪；不是在仓库里清点物资，就是跑到菜地帮助灌溉、锄草……。他说，一个领导干部不热情地做具体工作，就不能及时发现问题，不便和大家一起商量，迅速解决问题。去年初冬，下了一场大雪，猪棚有些漏水。他和饲养员商量好，猪床湿漉漉的容易影响猪的健康，雪一过就打扫，不让棚顶积雪。以后，饲养员把这件事忘了。可是，每次下过雪，猪棚顶盖都干干净净。饲养员知道这是郅顺义打扫的，很受感动，以后就加强了饲养管理。现在，这个猪场成了没有猪瘟的先进单位。
    有一次，部队外出演习。出发时，他考虑指挥所人不多，只带一个炊事员。以后人增多了，首长和同志们都关切地对他说：这一大摊子事，你和一个炊事员那能忙得过来，再调个人来吧！他说：“现在大家都忙，我和炊事员商量商量大概可以干下来。”随即，他就找炊事员袁俊良说：“老袁，你我都是共产党员，这一台子戏，连唱带打咱俩包下来行不行？”于是，两人在草原上整整忙了两个月。他买菜、做饭、招待来往人员，每天干到深夜。
    郅顺义对公家的一针一线都非常爱护。他走路时经常注意搜索被人看不在眼里的点滴东西。不管是一根钉子、一块铁皮、一条木棍，只要他碰到，都要捡起来。东西捡得多了，他就送到仓库里。他说：“别看它破，这都是劳动人民的血汗，有用的就是好东西。在过去的艰苦年月，董存瑞同志在行军时见一块破皮子、一缕麻都要拾起来。宿营时，他就用这些东西给战士们补鞋，不然，就不能继续行军作战。现在，我们虽然家大业大了，也不可大手大脚。”几年来，他拾了许多被人遗弃的物资，为国家节省了不少经费。许多人感动地说：“郅顺义副科长真是一个永不褪色的老英雄！”
      克己为公舍己为人
    从董存瑞英勇牺牲以后，郅顺义就经常说，董存瑞所以能为了全局、为了战斗胜利，举起炸药包舍身炸敌人的碉堡，就是因为他对革命事业无限忠诚。他处处以董存瑞为榜样，不管干啥，总是先从集体着眼，先替人家打算，从不计算自己的得失。
    今年春天部队要修一个养鱼池。因为工具不足，工地太小，施工部队不能同时作业，每天必须分三班轮换劳动。那时，全体干部正集中时间学习文化。郅顺义想：学文化是件大事，多抽一个人就影响一个人的功课。于是，他自告奋勇领导这一工作。其实，他更迫切需要学习文化。他参军前没有念一天书，现在也只是能写写信，看看文件。可是他没有想到这些，只觉得照顾更多人学习，比自己一个人学习重要的多。
    按说一个人指挥三班作业，每天跟一班、两班劳动就不少了，可是他在工地上搭了个小窝棚，每天三班都跟战士们一道劳动。他知道新战士没有爆破经验，下炸药他领着干，危险的活自己包下来，免得士兵遭到意外。他看到战士们干活很累，歇活后顾不得修理工具，他就利用自己休息的时间把土筐修好。人们看他一天难得有六个小时睡眠，常常劝他早下工多休息一会。他说：“一个人休息是小事，全工地的活计是大事。”为了全工地，他不辞劳苦地和大家一起劳动。
    有几次，他睡到半夜，听到外面的风雨声就猛然爬起来往外走。他爱人问他到那儿去？他照例说声“有事”。在雨中，他走遍营房，把没关严的门窗关严，把没收起的东西收好。在平时，他总是睡在别人后头，把别人没有关的门窗关好，把别人没拧好的水龙头拧好，把该关的电灯关上，然后才安心地去睡觉。
        谦逊的美德
    在解放战争中，郅顺义南征北战，为人民建立了功勋。华北解放后，他从南下进军、抗美援朝直到现在，他几乎年年立功，事事受表扬。党和国家给了他崇高的荣誉。他是毛泽东奖章获得者、出席全国战斗英雄代表大会代表、模范共产党员。在他所属的部队里，从首长到士兵，人人都叫他“老英雄”。逢年过节，许多地方机关、学校请他做报告；每月都有几十封来自祖国各地的信，向英雄表达自己的进步决心。
    郅顺义对党、祖国和群众给他的荣誉有着十分正确的认识。他不止一次对人说：“这绝不是我一个人的荣誉，没有党和群众的力量，我一个人又能做些啥！”
    有一次，有一支部队邀请他去作报告。官兵们听到了英雄要来部队的消息，打扫营房，张贴标语，还准备第二天敲锣打鼓欢迎他。可是郅顺义头天晚上就乘火车去了，下火车正是半夜时分。这时，他原可以在车站附近找家旅馆住下，第二天早上再到邀请他的单位去。但他仍像每次外出一样，连夜步行到离车站很远的营房。进了值班室，他见值班员正睡着，就悄悄地和衣倒在一条长条凳上睡下了。天一亮，值班员发现郅顺义的时候，感动得握着他的手不知说啥好：“哎呀，老英雄，我们还正准备欢迎你，你来了怎么不叫我一声？”郅顺义说：“这多好，你休息了，我也休息了，也免得大家耽误时间，影响训练。”
