In the midst of the competition upsurge

　　Competing with "Big Brother"
The Twenty-Third Excavation Team of the Dattai Coal Mine under the Jingxi Mining Bureau is the most outstanding rapid excavation team in the entire bureau. Last year, it set a mine-wide record of advancing 927 meters in one month. The Twentieth Team was newly established in July last year. Most of its members are new workers, and most of the team leaders were originally workers from the Twenty-Third Team, so they call the Twenty-Third Team "Big Brother." However, they were not willing to lag behind and recently launched a heated competition with the Twenty-Third Team.

　　Not long ago, the Twenty-Third Team set a record of advancing 13.5 meters per four-person shift during the mine-wide "Production Sports Meet," winning the championship. The workers of the Twentieth Team immediately held a meeting to study and decided to catch up. They sent team leader Han Shiqi and others to the Twenty-Third Team to learn advanced techniques such as relay slotting and off-site crossover, and received enthusiastic assistance from the Twenty-Third Team. After learning the Twenty-Third Team's management experience of "Three Determinations and One Guarantee," the Twentieth Team further developed it into "Three Determinations and Three Guarantees": determining personnel, determining work locations, determining efficiency, guaranteeing safety, guaranteeing quality, and guaranteeing tasks. They implemented the plan to each person and further developed the competition between teams into competition between shifts, between types of work, and between individuals. They quickly set a mine-wide record of advancing 1,038.5 meters in one month, surpassing the Twenty-Third Team.

　　The Twentieth Team moved ahead. The workers of the Twenty-Third Team hurriedly sent people to learn from their experience and packaged and promoted the newly learned experience on a large scale. As a result, they won two consecutive overall championships and three mine-wide championships in the "Production Sports Meet," and set a high-speed excavation record of advancing 1,102.35 meters in one month. The workers of the Twentieth Team never slackened their efforts. They continued their efforts, climbed to a higher level, and set a new bureau-wide record of advancing 1,140.6 meters in one month.

　　Under the leadership of the Twentieth and Twenty-Third Teams, other excavation teams in the Dattai Mine also launched competitions one after another, and the advance level increased rapidly. Now, one-third of the excavation teams in the entire mine are approaching the excavation level of the Twenty-Third Team. (Xin)

　　同“老大哥”较劲
    京西矿务局大台煤矿掘进二十三组，是全局各矿最优秀的一个快速掘进小组，去年曾经首创月进九百二十七米的全矿最高纪录。二十组是去年7月刚成立的新组，组内多是新工人，班长也大多原来是二十三组工人，所以他们称二十三组是“老大哥”。但是他们不甘落后，最近同二十三组展开了热烈的竞赛。
    不久以前，二十三组在全矿“生产运动会”上创造了四个人班进尺十三点五米的纪录，荣获冠军称号。二十组的工人马上开会研究，决心迎头赶上去。他们派班长韩士其等到二十三组去学习接力掏槽、异地交叉等先进经验，得到了二十三组的热情帮助。二十组的工人学习了二十三组的“三定一包”的管理经验以后，又进一步发展为定人、定工作地点、定效率、包安全、包质量、包任务的“三定三包”，把计划落实到每个人，并且进一步把组与组的竞赛发展为班与班、工种与工种、个人与个人的竞赛。他们很快创造了月进一千零三十八点五米的全矿纪录，超过了二十三组。
    二十组赶到前面了。二十三组的工人急忙派人去学习经验，并且把新学到的经验成龙配套，大力推广，结果在“生产运动会”上又连续获得两次全局冠军、三次全矿冠军，并且创造了月进一千一百零二点三五米的高速掘进纪录。二十组的工人始终没有松劲，他们再接再厉，更上一层楼，又创造了月进一千一百四十点六米的全局最高纪录。
    在二十组和二十三组的带动下，大台矿其他掘进组也纷纷展开竞赛，进尺水平迅速上升。现在，全矿已经有三分之一的掘进组接近了二十三组的掘进水平。　　　（新）
