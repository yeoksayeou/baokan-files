Xinhua News Agency, Ulan Bator, 30th -- The Mongolian Ministry of Industry and the Trade Union of Employees of Industrial and Mining Enterprises have decided to launch a socialist labor emulation drive in the industrial and mining enterprise sector from September 1 this year to July 1 next year to greet the 40th anniversary of the Mongolian People's Revolution (July 11, 1961).

The conditions for winning the competition are: fulfilling the monthly output value and the production plan of major products during the competition period, reducing product costs, over fulfilling the revenue plan, implementing labor insurance safety measures, and not having any work-related injuries. Each factory and mine should summarize the results of the competition every quarter, and each workshop should summarize the task completion of workers every month. Factories that win will be rewarded.

The Ministry of Industry and the Trade Union Committee of Employees of Industrial and Mining Enterprises called on the administrative organs and trade union organizations of various industrial and mining enterprises to carry out socialist labor emulation among enterprises, workshops, and workers according to the conditions of socialist competition, strive to over fulfill the production and income plans for the second half of 1960 and the first half of 1961, improve labor productivity, and further develop invention and innovation activities and put forward more rationalization proposals. The trade union also called on workers, staff, technicians, and engineers of industrial and mining enterprises to actively participate in this competition.

Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 24th -- Factories and mines throughout the Soviet Union are vigorously engaged in competition, striving to improve product quality and win honor for their products.

The first to initiate this competition were the employees of the Moscow "Milling Cutter" Tool Factory. At the beginning of this year, they published an open letter in "Izvestia" proposing that in the struggle to accelerate the construction of Soviet communism, everything produced in the Soviet Union should be high-quality products, and the reputation of Soviet products should be continuously enhanced in the world. Therefore, they have taken measures to improve the quality of their products and called on the vast number of employees in various places to actively devote themselves to the struggle to improve product quality with a communist labor attitude.

The competition to improve product quality is closely integrated with the technical innovation movement. At the Kharkov Electrical Insulation Materials Factory, in order to make the factory's products world-class, the employees, after carefully studying the characteristics of insulating materials produced by famous foreign companies, proposed a guarantee: to complete the task of technically re-equipping the factory not in seven years, but in five years; on the basis of adopting new technologies, to reach the requirement of product quality conforming to the latest achievements of world science and technology not in seven years, but in the next two or three years. Through the efforts of the employees, the scrap rate of this factory has been reduced by 50% compared with the past, and the quality of some products has exceeded the quality of foreign first-class insulating materials.

The employees of the Uglinsk Piston Ring Factory in the Akmola Oblast of the Kazakh Republic, as a result of actively improving production technology, have now extended the service life of tractor piston rings from 800 hours to 2,000 hours. They are now trying to double the service life of the piston rings again.

In the Donets Coal Region, the coal mining team led by Socialist Labor Hero Korchek recently guaranteed that every ton of coal would be of high quality, and the rock content in the coal mine would be reduced by one-third. Because all miners participated in the work of supervising product quality and excellently improved the methods of rock blasting and supporting the working face, the work team has now reduced the rock content in the coal mine by one-half. Under the impetus of this work team, many mines in this mining area are actively striving to improve product quality.

Xinhua News Agency, Budapest, 24th -- Hungarian miners have widely launched labor emulation campaigns this year, achieving good production results.

Coal miners overfulfilled the plan by a total of 340,000 tons of coal in the first half of this year, and the quality of coal has also greatly improved. The employees of other mining enterprises overfulfilled the plan for the first half of the year by 9%, producing various mineral products worth 16 million forints more than originally planned, and reducing production costs by 4 million forints.

The pioneers of the miners' labor emulation drive are the workers of the Komlo Coal Mine. In the labor emulation drive to greet "Miner's Day" (September 4), they have completed the annual increase production task five months ahead of schedule, overfulfilling the plan by more than 30,000 tons of coal. Workers at the Dorog Coal Mine, through increasing labor productivity, will complete their task of increasing the annual production of 33,000 tons of coal by the time of Miner's Day. In this way, by the end of this year, they will have increased production by a total of 50,000 tons of coal. The Borsod Coal Mining United Enterprise saved imported pit props worth 5 million forints in the first seven months of this year.

Oil workers proposed in the labor emulation drive to greet "Miner's Day" that by September 4, they would produce 6,000 tons of oil more than originally planned as a gift task. In addition, the oil workers also vigorously promoted automation. They guaranteed that by Miner's Day, one-quarter of the oil wells would be automated.

Iron ore miners proposed an annual increase production gift task of 7.5 million forints, and they had completed 81.3% in the first half of the year.

    蒙古开展劳动竞赛迎接革命四十周年
    苏联很多厂矿企业积极提高产品质量
    匈牙利煤矿工人开展劳动竞赛取得良好成绩
    新华社乌兰巴托30日电　蒙古工业部和工矿企业职工工会决定，从今年9月1日起到明年7月1日止，在工矿企业部门开展社会主义劳动竞赛，以迎接蒙古人民革命四十周年（1961年7月11日）。
    竞赛获胜的条件是：完成月产值和竞赛期主要产品的生产计划，降低产品成本，超额完成收入计划，实现劳动保险安全措施，不发生任何工伤事故。各厂矿要每季总结一次，各车间每月总结一次竞赛结果和工人完成任务的情况。对获得优胜的工厂将予以奖励。
    工业部和工矿企业职工工会委员会号召各工矿企业行政机构和工会组织根据社会主义竞赛条件在企业车间和工人中间开展社会主义劳动竞赛，争取超额完成1960年下半年和1961年上半年的生产计划和收入计划，提高劳动生产率，进一步开展发明创造活动和提出更多的合理化建议。工会并号召工矿企业工人、职员、技师和工程师积极参加这一竞赛。
    新华社莫斯科24日电　苏联各地的厂矿企业正在蓬勃地展开竞赛，为提高产品质量和争取本厂产品荣誉而努力。
    首先发起这一竞赛的是莫斯科“铣刀”工具厂的职工。今年年初他们在“消息报”上发表的一封公开信中提出，在加速苏联共产主义建设的斗争中，应该使苏联出产的一切产品都成为优质产品，使苏联产品的信誉在世界上不断提高。因此，他们采取了提高本厂产品质量的措施，同时号召各地广大职工以共产主义的劳动态度积极投入提高产品质量的斗争。
    提高产品质量的竞赛是同技术革新运动密切结合进行的。在哈尔科夫电器绝缘材料工厂，职工们为了使本厂产品成为世界上优质的产品，在详细地研究了著名的外国公司生产的绝缘材料的特性以后提出保证：不是用七年，而是用五年完成在技术上重新装备本厂的任务；在采用新技术的基础上，不是用七年，而是在最近两三年内就使本厂的产品质量达到符合世界科学技术最新成就的要求的水平。经过职工们的努力，目前这家工厂的废品率已比过去降低了50％，某些产品的质量已经超过了外国一级绝缘材料的质量。
    哈萨克共和国阿克摩林斯克州的乌金斯克活塞环工厂的职工，由于积极改进生产技术的结果，目前已经使拖拉机活塞环的使用期限从八百小时延长到两千小时。他们现在正设法使活塞环的使用期限再延长一倍。
    在顿?茨煤区，由社会主义劳动英雄科尔契克领导的采煤工作队最近保证，要使每一吨煤都是高质量的煤，煤矿中的岩石含量要减少三分之一。由于全体矿工都参加监督产品质量的工作、出色地改进岩石爆破和支撑工作面的方法，目前，这个工作队已经使煤矿中的岩石含量减少了二分之一。在这个工作队的带动下，这个矿区的许多矿井都在积极地为提高产品质量而奋斗。
    新华社布达佩斯24日电　匈牙利矿工今年以来广泛展开劳动竞赛，取得了良好的生产成绩。
    煤矿工人在今年上半年内共超计划开采了三十四万吨煤，煤的质量也有很大提高。其他采矿企业的职工超额9％完成了上半年的计划，比原计划多开采了价值一千六百万福林的各种矿产品，生产成本降低了四百万福林。
    矿工劳动竞赛的先锋是柯姆洛煤矿的工人。他们在迎接“矿工节” （9月4日）的劳动竞赛中，已提前五个月完成了全年的增产任务，超计划生产了三万多吨煤。多洛格煤矿工人通过提高劳动生产率的途径，到矿工节的时候将要完成他们提出的全年增产三万三千多吨煤的任务。这样，到今年年底，他们共将增产五万吨煤。包尔绍德煤矿联合企业今年头七个月内共节约了价值五百万福林的进口坑木。
    石油工人们在迎接“矿工节”的劳动竞赛中提出，到9月4日止要比原计划多生产六千吨石油的献礼任务。此外，石油工人们还大搞自动化，他们保证，到矿工节时要有四分之一的油井实现自动化。
    铁矿工人提出全年增产七百五十万福林的献礼任务，在上半年内就已完成了81.3％。
