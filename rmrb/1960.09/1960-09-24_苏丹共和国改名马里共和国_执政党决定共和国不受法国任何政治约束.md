Xinhua News Agency, Bamako, September 23rd: The Legislative Assembly of Sudan (West Africa) unanimously passed a resolution on the 22nd, declaring the Republic of Mali (renamed from the Republic of Sudan) to be an independent and sovereign nation.

Earlier that day, the ruling Sudanese Union party held an extraordinary congress and unanimously passed a resolution deciding to rename the Republic of Sudan as the Republic of Mali. The resolution stated: The Republic of Mali is not bound by any political ties it has with France. Sudan and Senegal formerly constituted the Mali Federation and declared federal independence in April of this year. Not long ago, Senegal suddenly announced its withdrawal from the Mali Federation, and France immediately recognized Senegal as an independent republic. Therefore, the Sudanese Union party pointed out in its resolution at the congress that Sudan's decision was the inevitable result of France's abrupt sabotage of the Franco-Malian agreement.

　  苏丹共和国改名马里共和国
    执政党决定共和国不受法国任何政治约束
    新华社23日讯　巴马科消息：苏丹（西非）立法议会22日一致通过决议，宣布（由苏丹共和国改名的）马里共和国为一个独立和主权的国家。
    当天早些时候，执政的苏丹联盟党举行了非常代表大会，一致通过决议，决定苏丹共和国改名为马里共和国。决议说：马里共和国不受它同法国任何政治联系的约束。苏丹同塞内加尔曾经组成马里联邦，并在今年4月布联邦独立。不久前，塞内加尔突然宣布退出马里联邦，法国也立即承认塞内加尔为独立共和国。因此，苏丹联盟党在代表大会的决议中指出，苏丹的这一决定是法国断然破坏了法国—马里协定的必然结果。
