    Don't Underestimate Indigenous Methods
    Wang Jie, Worker at Kailuan Linxi Mine
    In the technical innovation and technical revolution movement, workers often say, "Indigenous and foreign methods combined, have infinite power," and "Combining indigenous and foreign, yields more, faster, better, and more economically." This is indeed the case.
    Combining indigenous and foreign methods is one of a series of “walking on two legs” policies in the Party's general line for socialist construction. In the technical innovation and technical revolution movement, workers praised this policy as "opening the door for workers to engage in technical revolution in a big way" and "opening up a front for engaging in technical revolution in a big way." Take the riveters and forgers workshop of our electromechanical section's repair shop as an example. In April of this year, in order to realize the mechanization of the entire assembly line, all the workers in the workshop worked together to design, process, and trial-produce indigenous machinery and tools to arm themselves. Because indigenous methods are simple and easy to implement, everyone can get involved, and as a result, in just a few days, more than 70 kinds of indigenous equipment and tools were created, making the production capacity in April double that of March. Don't these situations precisely illustrate that the policy of combining indigenous and foreign methods is a magic weapon with infinite power!
    The policy of combining indigenous and foreign methods can fully mobilize the enthusiasm and creativity of the masses, and can organize and attract the masses to the technical innovation and technical revolution movement. To earnestly implement this policy, we must oppose the thinking of "believing in foreign methods and looking down on indigenous methods." In the technical innovation and technical revolution movement, some people often exhibit this kind of thinking. In the past, our electromechanical section's repair shop also had this kind of thinking. Because they only pursued foreign methods, relying solely on buying large foreign equipment from outside, or relying on a few people to research and manufacture complex foreign equipment, the results were difficult to achieve, making technical innovation lukewarm and unable to get going. "Believing in foreign methods and looking down on indigenous methods" is actually ignoring or not believing in the enthusiasm and creativity of the masses, keeping the masses outside the "door of technical revolution." Of course, technical innovation and technical revolution cannot be turned into a vigorous mass movement.
    The reason why some people look down on indigenous methods is because they always feel that indigenous methods are simple, and simplicity means backwardness. In fact, advanced and backward cannot be divided by complexity and simplicity, but must be viewed to see whether they are adapted to the current situation of the Great Leap Forward, and whether they meet the requirements of more, faster, better, and more economical. Indigenous methods can utilize local materials, adapt to local conditions, are simple and easy to implement, and are convenient for everyone to participate in. In this way, they are implemented quickly, save labor and materials, and have great effects, which precisely meets the principle of more, faster, better, and more economical. At the same time, we should also see that indigenous methods are created by the masses based on years of labor experience, and some also absorb the advantages of foreign methods. Therefore, many indigenous machines, indigenous tools, etc., are not only simpler and easier to implement, easier to manufacture and master than ordinary "foreign" ones, but also have higher efficiency and better quality. Take the indigenous scissors created by our electromechanical section's repair shop as an example. Although they are much simpler than the original foreign scissors, made of old waste materials, and look "rustic," they have many improvements over the original foreign scissors and have very prominent advantages over the original foreign scissors. For example, the original foreign scissors could not cut 700 mm wide iron plates, but the indigenous scissors avoided this shortcoming in the design, and can cut iron plates of any width. The workers happily said, "Who says indigenous methods are backward? Look at the indigenous scissors, they are better than the foreign scissors!"
    Of course, advocating indigenous methods does not mean that foreign methods are not good. Foreign methods are also what we need. The problem is not to "believe in foreign methods and look down on indigenous methods." "Believing in foreign methods and looking down on indigenous methods," to carry out technical innovation and technical revolution according to this kind of thinking, can only result in less, slower, worse, and more expensive. Only by earnestly implementing the policy of combining indigenous and foreign methods can the technical innovation and technical revolution movement be carried out vigorously, more, faster, better, and more economically.

    不能小看土办法
    开滦林西矿工人　王杰
    在技术革新和技术革命运动中，工人们常说：“土洋并举，威力无穷”，“土洋结合，多快好省”。确实是这样。
    土洋并举，是党的社会主义建设总路线中一系列
  “两条腿走路”方针中的一个。在技术革新和技术革命运动中，工人们都称赞这个方针是“给工人敞开了大闹技术革命的大门”，“给大闹技术革命开辟了阵地”。拿我们机电科修配厂铆锻车间来说，今年4月份，为了整个作业线都要实现机械化，全车间工人一齐动手，搞设计，搞加工，搞试制，创造土机械、土工具，自己武装自己。由于土办法简单易行，人人插得上手，结果，没有几天的功夫就创造出七十多种土设备、土工具，使4月份生产能力比3月份翻了一番。这些情况，不是正好说明土洋并举的方针，是有无穷威力的法宝吗！
    土洋并举的方针，能够充分调动群众的积极性和创造性，能够把群众都组织和吸引到技术革新和技术革命运动中来。要认真贯彻这个方针，就必须反对那种“迷信洋法，小瞧土法”的思想。在技术革新和技术革命运动中，往往有些人表现出这种思想。过去我们机电科修配厂也有过这种思想。由于光追求洋的，单靠从外边买大的洋的设备，或靠少数人研究制造复杂的洋设备，结果，都不易办到，使技术革新冷冷清清，搞不起来。“迷信洋的，小瞧土的”，实际上是忽视或不相信群众的积极性和创造性，把群众关在“技术革命的大门”之外，当然技术革新和技术革命就不能搞成轰轰烈烈的群众运动了。
    有些人所以看不起土的，因为他们总觉得土办法简易，而简易就是落后。其实，先进与落后不能用复杂和简易来划分，必须看它们是不是适应当前大跃进的形势，是不是符合多快好省的要求。土办法可以就地取材，因地制宜，简单易行，便于人人动手，这样，做起来实现得快，省工省料，效果大，正是符合多快好省原则的。同时，我们还应该看到，土办法是群众根据常年的劳动经验创造出来的，有的还吸取了洋法的长处，因此，许许多多土的机器、土工具等，比通常“洋”的不仅简单易行、便于制造和掌握，而且效率更高，质量更好。就拿我们机电科修配厂创造的土剪刀来说，虽然比原有的洋剪刀简单得多，用旧废料做的，看起来“土里土气”，但是，它比原有的洋剪刀有很多改进，比原有的洋剪刀具有很突出的优点。比如，原有的洋剪刀不能剪七百公厘宽的铁板，土剪刀在设计时就避免了这个缺点，多么宽的铁板都能剪。工人们高兴地说：“谁说土法落后？请看土剪刀就赛过了洋剪刀！”
    当然，提倡土法，并不是说洋法不好。洋法也是我们需要的。问题是不要“迷信洋法，小瞧土法”。“迷信洋法，小瞧土法”，按照这种思想去搞技术革新和技术革命，得到的只能是少慢差费。只有认真贯彻执行土洋并举的方针，才能使技术革新和技术革命运动，搞得轰轰烈烈，多快好省。
