Revolutionary Cadres Should Always Share Weal and Woe with the Masses
应麟

Some time ago, more than 10,000 cadres in Kunshan County, Jiangsu Province, put forward a slogan of "Three Goes and Three No Returns" when they went to the forefront of agricultural production. "Three Goes" means: go to the fields to participate in production and set an example, go to the production team to study work and create experience, and go to the most difficult places to solve problems. "Three No Returns" means: do not return without solving problems, do not return without creating experience, and do not return without changing the face of production. The determination of the comrades in Kunshan County is commendable, and this spirit is worth greatly promoting.

Why is this spirit worth promoting? Because the slogan "Three Goes and Three No Returns" shows that our party's cadres are willing to go deep into the grassroots, willing to go to the most difficult places, share weal and woe with the masses, earnestly implement the party's policy of taking agriculture as the foundation, and further change the face of rural areas. Since the liberation of the whole country, especially in the past two or three years, the development of agricultural production in our country has been very rapid, but it is still relatively backward. Therefore, in order to better implement the policy of taking agriculture as the foundation and strive for a bumper harvest this autumn, it is necessary to send a large number of cadres to strengthen the agricultural production front and lead the commune members to carry out the movement of increasing production and practicing economy with grain as the center. The comrades who are sent to the countryside bear a glorious and arduous task, and they must have long-term plans, be determined to go deep into the grassroots, go deep into the most arduous and difficult places, and implement "four togethers" with the masses, both influencing the masses with their own actions and practically helping local cadres solve problems in production and work. This means that only by working in the countryside with peace of mind and sharing weal and woe with the masses can we do a good job.

Marxism-Leninism points out that revolution and construction are the affairs of the masses themselves. Only when the broad masses of the people start to work with their own hands can the revolution succeed and the construction cause develop smoothly. In agricultural production, it is necessary to fully mobilize the enthusiasm and initiative of the people so that agricultural production can grow faster, especially to make the current rural movement of increasing production and practicing economy with grain as the center flourish. Countless practical experiences tell us that going deep among the masses, sharing weal and woe with the masses, truly caring about their sufferings, and helping them solve various problems can achieve this goal. For example, Luo Yangchun, the party branch secretary of the Dongting Red Production Team of Shuanghua Commune in Yuanjiang County, Hunan Province, is a 21-year-old young woman who was originally the women's director of the Sihu Mountain Brigade and was assigned to help work in an advanced team. When the Party General Branch proposed to quickly change the face of the backward team, she immediately responded to this call and went to the Dongting Red Production Team as the party branch secretary. When she first arrived, some people did not trust her, saying that she was still a "little girl carrying a cradle grass" and "couldn't do anything big." However, Comrade Luo Yangchun was not intimidated by the difficulties. She set an example in everything, took the lead in labor, and worked hard. The day after arriving at the team, she went to accumulate fertilizer with the commune members early in the morning. On the third day, it was raining heavily, and she ran to the work group leader to discuss sending someone to dig ditches to prevent the rape from being flooded. At that time, the group leader looked embarrassed. Without saying a word, she put on a raincoat, picked up a shovel, and ran to the field. She grasped both production and life. The canteen wanted to grow vegetables but had no vegetable seeds, so she ran to other villages to buy vegetable seeds. Some commune members were sick and no one at home took care of them, so she personally cooked medicine and soup. She was so wholeheartedly for production and for the masses, and the masses were naturally very motivated. They loved her and trusted her. Not only did commune members go to see her in groups when she was sick, but they were also willing to talk to her about any problems. In this way, under the leadership of Comrade Luo Yangchun, a backward production team caught up in all aspects after only a short period of four months and became an advanced production team.

However, this is only one aspect of the matter. On the other hand, cadres going deep among the masses, sharing weal and woe with the masses, and leading production through participation in production can also completely change the leadership style and leadership methods. The main task of leadership is to come up with ideas and find solutions. Where do ideas and solutions come from? We must truly go deep into the production and life of the masses, implement "four togethers," and completely integrate with the masses. Only in this way can we understand the feelings and desires of the masses, can we have a personal feeling about many problems in the production and life of the masses, and can we immediately use the ideas and solutions to guide the actions of the masses, so as to discover and solve problems in a timely manner. Recently, after a large number of cadres, especially leading cadres, went to the countryside, many problems were readily solved, and many successful experiences were promoted in a timely manner, which quickly improved production and work, which is the most powerful proof. For example, Li Xiaozhang, the first secretary of the Huairou County Party Committee of Beijing, found through labor in the Fule Production Team of Chengguan Commune that this team planted more early-maturing crops, but had less fertilizer reserves, and the fertilizer could not keep up with the needs of summer sowing and autumn sowing after the summer harvest. He immediately discussed with the cadres and commune members and worked out a method of applying green manure in the fields in a more economical, faster, better, and more economical way, which helped the team solve the difficulty of insufficient fertilizer. Then he promoted this method throughout the county, which played a role in promoting the county's fertilizer accumulation work. Obviously, this kind of problem, which seems to be very small but actually plays a big role in production, is not easy to discover if the leading cadres do not participate in labor on the spot. Even if it is discovered through reports, it is impossible to solve it so timely and so specifically.

All these show that cadres going deep among the masses and sharing weal and woe with the masses is by no means a temporary expedient measure, but a long-term and unwavering policy of the party, and a fine quality and work style that communists and revolutionary cadres should have. In the past period, the vast majority of comrades who went to work in the countryside have already done so, and they should continue to adhere to it in the future. They should all have the determination and tenacious fighting spirit of the comrades in Kunshan County that they will not return unless they further change the face of the countryside. Of course, going to the countryside, especially to poor and backward teams, will be more difficult for the time being. However, precisely because it is difficult, our cadres need to have lofty aspirations. In this way, we can truly strengthen leadership, thereby accelerating the development of rural productive forces, change the face of rural areas more quickly, and more forcefully support national construction. Communists and revolutionary cadres should originally "be the first to worry about the world's worries, and the last to enjoy the world's happiness." Therefore, wherever the work is most arduous and difficult, they should rush to that place and take the development of the local productive forces and the improvement of the local people's lives as their glorious responsibility. In the past arduous and difficult revolutionary war, our communists and revolutionary cadres did just that. Because our communists and revolutionary cadres carried forward the spirit of self-sacrifice, closely shared weal and woe with the masses, were not afraid of hardships and difficulties, and were not afraid of bloodshed and sacrifice, we achieved the great victory of the people's revolution. In the cause of socialist revolution and socialist construction, our communists and revolutionary cadres have continued to maintain and carry forward this glorious tradition, and have achieved great achievements. However, because our country's original foundation is too weak and our lives are not very prosperous, there are still many difficulties that we need to overcome, and we still need to continue to work hard with the broad masses of the people. Therefore, our comrades should be forward-looking, establish lofty aspirations, work hard, bury themselves in hard work, set an example, and lead the masses. As long as our comrades continue to do so and always maintain close ties with the masses, our country's construction cause will continue to develop at a high speed, and we will achieve greater and greater victories.

    革命干部永远要和群众同甘共苦
    应麟
    前些时候，江苏省昆山县的一万多名干部，在走向农业生产第一线的时候，提出了一个“三去三不回”的口号。“三去”是：到田头去参加生产做出样子，到生产小队去研究工作创造经验，到最困难的地方去解决问题。“三不回”是：不解决问题不回来，不创造经验不回来，不改变生产面貌不回来。昆山县同志们的这种决心是可嘉的，这种精神是值得大大发扬的。
    为什么这种精神值得发扬呢？因为“三去三不回”这个口号，表明了我们党的干部愿意深入基层，愿意到最困难的地方去，和群众同甘共苦，认真执行党的以农业为基础的方针，进一步改变农村面貌的决心和毅力。全国解放以来，特别是近两三年来，我国农业生产的发展是很快的，但仍然比较落后。因此，为了更好地贯彻农业为基础的方针，力争今年秋收多多益善，就有必要派出大批干部去加强农业生产战线，去领导公社社员开展以粮食为中心的增产节约运动。被派往农村的同志担负着光荣而又艰巨的任务，就要有长期打算，下决心深入到最基层去，深入到最艰苦、最困难的地方去，和群众实行“四同”，既以自己的行动影响群众，又切切实实地帮助当地干部解决生产和工作中的问题。这就是要安心在农村工作，和群众同甘共苦，才能够做好工作。
    马克思列宁主义指明，革命和建设都是群众自己的事情，只有广大群众自己动起手来，革命才能成功，建设事业才能顺利地发展。在农业生产上，就是要充分地调动起人民群众的积极性、主动性，使农业生产有更快的增长，特别是使当前的以粮食为中心的农村增产节约运动蓬蓬勃勃地开展起来。无数的实践经验告诉我们，深入群众，和群众同甘苦，共患难，真正关心他们的痛痒，帮助他们解决各种各样的问题，就能够达到这样的目的。例如，湖南省沅江县双华公社洞庭红生产队党支部书记罗阳春，是一个二十一岁的女青年，原是泗湖山大队的妇女主任，分工在一个先进队帮助工作。当党总支提出迅速改变后进队的面貌以后，她立刻响应了这个号召，到洞庭红生产队当党支部书记。她刚去的时候，一些群众并不信任她，说她还是“背摇窝草的小妹子”，
  “办不了什么大事”。然而罗阳春同志没有被困难吓倒，她处处以身作则，带头劳动，艰苦工作。到队后的第二天一清早，她就和社员一起去积肥。第三天下着倾盆大雨，她跑去找作业组长商量派人开沟，免得油菜被淹坏。当时组长面有难色，她二话没说，披起蓑衣，提着铁锹，就往田间跑去。她既抓生产又抓生活。食堂要种菜没有菜籽，她就跑到外村去买回菜籽；有的社员生了病，家里没有人照管，她就亲自去煮药熬汤。她这样全心全意地为生产、为群众，群众的干劲自然也就很足，也就热爱她、信任她，不但在她生病的时候，社员三五成群地去看她，而且有问题都愿意找她谈。这样，在罗阳春同志的领导下，一个后进的生产队，只经过短短的四个月，就在各方面都赶了上去，成为先进的生产队。
    然而，这还只是事情的一个方面。另一方面，干部深入群众，和群众同甘共苦，通过参加生产领导生产，还能彻底改变领导作风和领导方法。领导工作主要是出主意、想办法。主意和办法从何而来呢？必须真正深入到群众的生产和生活中去，实行“四同”，完全和群众打成一片。只有这样，才能了解群众的心情和愿望，才能对群众生产和生活中的许多问题有亲身的感受，才能使出的主意和想的办法立即用于指导群众的行动，做到及时发现问题和解决问题。最近一个时期，大批干部特别是领导干部下到农村以后，许多问题迎刃而解，许多成功的经验及时推广，使生产和工作迅速地改进，就是最有力的证明。例如，中共北京市怀柔县委第一书记李小章，通过在城关公社富乐生产队劳动，就发现这个队种的早熟作物较多，而肥料储备较少，夏收后肥料赶不上夏种秋种的需要。他立即和干部、社员一块商量，研究出了一种多快好省地在地头压绿肥的办法，帮助这个队解决了肥料不足的困难。接着他又把这个办法在全县推广，对全县的积肥工作起了推动作用。很显然，这种看来似乎很小、实际对生产起作用很大的问题，如果领导干部不亲临现场参加劳动，是不易发现的；即使通过汇报发现了，也不可能解决得那样及时，那样具体。
    所有这些都说明，干部深入群众，和群众同甘共苦，绝不是一时的权宜之计，而是党的长期的坚定不移的方针，是共产党人和革命干部应有的优良品质和工作作风。过去一个时期，下到农村工作的绝大多数同志已经这样作了，今后就应当继续坚持下去，都要像昆山县的同志那样，具有不进一步改变农村的面貌不回来的决心和顽强的斗志。当然，到农村去，特别是到穷队和落后队去，暂时要比较艰苦一些。但是，正因为艰苦，更需要我们的干部抱着雄心壮志。这样，才能真正加强领导，从而加速农村生产力的发展，更快地改变农村的面貌，更有力地支援国家建设。共产党人和革命干部本来应该“先天下之忧而忧，后天下之乐而乐”。所以，哪里的工作最艰苦、最困难，他们就应当奔赴哪里，以发展这个地方的生产力、提高这个地方人民的生活为自己光荣的职责。在过去的艰难困苦的革命战争中，我们共产党人和革命干部正是这样作的。因为我们共产党人和革命干部发扬了自我牺牲的精神，紧紧地和群众同甘苦、共患难，不怕艰难困苦，不怕流血牺牲，才取得了人民革命的伟大胜利。在社会主义革命和社会主义建设事业中，我们共产党人和革命干部继续保持和发扬了这一光荣传统，又取得了伟大的成绩。但是，由于我们国家原来的底子太薄，我们的日子还不很富裕，所以需要我们克服的困难还很多，还需要继续和广大群众一起艰苦奋斗。因此，我们的同志应该高瞻远瞩，树立雄心壮志，发愤图强，埋头苦干，以身作则，带动群众。只要我们的同志继续这样作，始终保持着和群众的紧密联系，我国的建设事业就会继续高速度地向前发展，我们就会取得一个比一个更加伟大的胜利。
