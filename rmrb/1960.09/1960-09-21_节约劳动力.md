To the Commune Party Committee Secretary:

　　Today, the headline news and the column below in this newspaper raise the issue of conserving labor power and introduce some specific measures to conserve labor power according to local conditions, which are of great reference value to the communes. We hope this will attract your attention.

　　Conserving labor power is a very important issue, because all social wealth and civilization are created by human labor. Especially as we are digging into labor potential from all aspects and enriching the agricultural front, it is even more necessary to strengthen labor management, scientifically use labor power, and resolutely prevent and overcome the waste of labor power. Countless facts have proven that the waste of labor power is the greatest waste; and the conservation of labor power is the greatest conservation. This is just like what Jia Linmao, director of the Nanbali Management Area of the Weiyuan Commune in Zuoyun County, Shanxi, said: Grain grows from crops, and crops are planted by people. The issue of conservation is, in the final analysis, the conservation of labor power.

　　As for how to conserve labor power, various places have rich experiences. After reading the news from Shanxi and Ningxia, we hope that you can also introduce your main experiences in strengthening labor management, so that various places can learn from each other, better improve labor efficiency, and promote the continuous leap forward in agricultural production.

### 节约劳动力

　　节约劳动力
    公社党委书记：
    今天本报发表的头条消息和下辟栏提出了节约劳动力的问题，并且介绍了一些因地制宜节约劳力的具体措施，对各公社很有参考价值，希望能引起你们的注意。
    节约劳动力是一个十分重要的问题，因为一切的社会财富和文明都是人的劳动创造的。特别是当我们正从各个方面挖掘劳动潜力，充实农业战线的时候，更加需要加强劳动管理、科学地使用劳动力，坚决防止和克服劳动力的浪费现象。无数的事实证明：劳动力的浪费，是最大的浪费；而劳动力的节约，则是最大的节约。这正像山西左云县威远公社南八里管理区主任贾林茂说的：粮食是庄稼长的，庄稼是人种的，节约问题归根到底还是个节约劳动力。
    至于怎样节约劳动力，各地都有丰富的经验。希望你们在看了山西和宁夏的消息之后，也能把你们加强劳动管理的主要经验介绍出来，以便各地互相学习，更好地提高劳动效率，促进农业生产的持续跃进。
