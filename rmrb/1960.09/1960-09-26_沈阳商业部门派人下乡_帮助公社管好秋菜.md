　　Shenyang Commercial Departments Send Personnel to the Countryside
　　Helping Communes Manage Autumn Vegetables
According to the Shenyang Daily, in order to promote the development of vegetable production and increase market supply, Shenyang municipal commercial department employees, while supporting grain and steel production, have dispatched a large number of employees to the countryside since August to assist communes in managing autumn vegetable fields, striving for a bumper harvest this year.

Comprehensive stores in various districts of Shenyang have adopted the method of assigning areas, designating fixed support labor, and establishing fixed production and sales relationships, sending employees to reside in production teams in the countryside, participate in production, and assist in arranging and organizing production. They are jointly responsible for everything from field management to autumn vegetable harvesting, transportation, and storage, taking full responsibility from start to finish. According to statistics from the five districts of Heping, Dadong, Shenhe, Tiexi, and Huanggu, there are more than 4,000 commercial cadres sent to the vegetable-growing communes. Among them, more than 70 Party branch secretaries and store managers have assumed the positions of deputy captains of production teams, strengthening the leadership of the production teams.

These quartermasters, active in the vegetable fields, ate, lived, and labored with the commune members from the first day they arrived in the countryside, discussing matters together. Employees of the Xingshun Comprehensive Store in Tiexi District, in vegetable production, explored a new method of organizing eight types of personnel to go to the countryside: organizers and commanders (leading cadres), resident team members, technical instructors, researchers, storage and transportation personnel, propagandists, cooks, and childcare workers. These eight personnel closely cooperated with all aspects of the production team, and jointly formed six networks, namely, an economic liaison network, a field management network, a storage and transportation cooperation network, a technical research network, a propaganda and study network, and a living welfare network. The economic liaison network is responsible for communicating economic information between urban and rural areas, understanding production, consumption, supply, and other economic conditions, so that production is more in line with market needs. The field management network is responsible for helping production teams rationally arrange labor and comprehensively strengthen vegetable field management. The storage and transportation cooperation network is responsible for rationally scheduling the use of vehicles to transport vegetables to the city on time. The technical research network is responsible for summarizing experience and promoting vegetable high-yield, and reforming agricultural tools. The living welfare network, centered on the canteen, is responsible for organizing the economic life of the commune members well, so as to promote the commune members to better participate in production. The propaganda and study network uses spare time to organize learning and publicize the Party's guidelines and policies. After these six networks were established, they played a significant role. Gu Huaide, a resident team member of the Zhao Family Production Team of the China-Korea Friendship Commune participating in the field management network, discovered that more than 30 mu of leek fields in the team had not been weeded. He contacted the store, and immediately organized more than 50 employees to rush to pull weeds. Without affecting the store's business, it took only three days to remove the weeds and cut more than 100,000 catties of leeks to supply the market. After the storage and transportation cooperation network was established, using convenient transportation, in August alone, the store transported more than 150,000 catties of various vegetables from the Zhao Family Production Team, and transported more than 100,000 catties of fertilizer produced by the production team in the city to the fields. This saved a batch of manpower and animal power, which was invested in field management.

### 沈阳商业部门派人下乡　帮助公社管好秋菜

　　沈阳商业部门派人下乡
  　帮助公社管好秋菜
    据沈阳日报消息　为了促进蔬菜生产的发展和增加市场供应，沈阳市商业部门职工，在支援粮、钢生产的同时，从8月以来，抽调大批职工下乡，协助公社搞好秋菜田间管理，力争今年秋菜大丰收。
    沈阳市区各综合商店采取分片定点、固定支援劳动力、固定产销关系的办法，派职工下乡驻在生产队，参加生产，帮助安排和组织生产。他们从田间管理，直到秋菜收割、调运和贮藏，都和生产队共同负责，一包到底。据和平、大东、沈河、铁西、皇姑五个区的统计，派到菜区公社的商业干部共有四千多名。其中有七十多名党支部书记和商店经理担任了生产队的副队长职务，充实了生产队的领导力量。
    这批活跃在菜田里的后勤兵，在下乡的第一天就和社员同吃、同住、同劳动，有事共同商量。铁西区兴顺综合商店职工，在蔬菜生产中，摸索到一条组织指挥员（领导骨干）、驻队员、技术辅导员、调查研究员、储运员、宣传员、炊事员、保育员八员下乡的新作法。这八大员和生产队各个环节密切协作，又共同组成六网，即经济联络网、田间管理网、储运协作网、技术研究网、宣传学习网、生活福利网。经济联络网负责沟通城乡经济情报，掌握生产、消费、供应等经济情况，使生产更加切合市场的需要。田间管理网负责帮助生产队合理安排劳动力，全面加强菜田管理。储运协作网负责合理调度使用车辆，将蔬菜按时运到城市。技术研究网负责总结经验，推广蔬菜丰产、改革农具等经验。生活福利网以食堂为中心，负责把社员的经济生活组织好，以促使社员更好地参加生产。宣传学习网则利用业余时间，组织学习，宣传党的方针政策。这六网建立起来以后，发挥了很大作用。参加田间管理网的中朝友谊公社赵家生产队驻队员顾怀德，发现队里有三十多亩韭菜地尚未锄草，他和商店联系，立即组织了五十多名职工突击拔草，在不影响商店业务的情况下，只用三天时间就把草拔完，并割了十万多斤韭菜，供应了市场。建立了储运协作网后，采取捎脚运输，仅8月份，商店就由赵家生产队运回各种蔬菜十五万多斤，并把生产队在市内的十万多斤肥料运到田里。这样就节省出一批人力、畜力，投入田间管理。
