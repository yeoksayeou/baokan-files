Xinhua News Agency, Hefei, September 15th. Huainan Coal Mine workers, with groups as the main force, have launched a "Set a Starting Point, Rise Step by Step" competition, driving a significant increase in coal production. The average daily output of the entire mine in late August increased by 8% compared to mid-August, and in early September, it increased by another 5% compared to late August.

The main content of the "Set a Starting Point, Rise Step by Step" group competition is as follows: Each work group, according to the stipulated monthly plan and different production conditions, sets different advanced collective quotas as the "starting point" target for the competition, and then launches a competition to surpass the starting point and rise step by step.

As soon as the "Set a Starting Point, Rise Step by Step" competition began, more than two thousand coal mining, pillar removal, material transportation, tunneling, and electromechanical groups in various mines threw themselves into a wave of catching up with each other. Zhou Jianmin's group from the Second Coal Mining Team of the First District of Xie'er Mine, on the first day of the competition, surpassed Zhang Wenfa's group from the Tenth Coal Mining Team of the Third District with a production of 110 tons of coal. After work, the two groups immediately held meetings to summarize their experiences, and the next day both groups increased their coal production to 198 tons. On the third day, the two groups raced against time even more, working harder and harder, and both groups completed their daily production tasks in just over six hours. After the workers of Li'yi Mine launched the competition, 322 groups broke through the "starting point" target. After the workers of Xie'san Mine launched the "Set a Starting Point, Rise Step by Step" competition, they also frequently overfulfilled their production tasks, with an average daily output increase of 17% and a tunneling footage increase of 41%.

After the competition unfolded, many previously lagging coal mining teams and groups quickly caught up. The Ninth Coal Mining Team of Xie'san Mine had a relatively poor record of completing its plan. After the competition, all the team members actively learned new technologies, increased the cycle progress, and reformed the cycle organization. Since late August, they have been achieving double cycles every day, and the average daily output has rapidly increased by 20%. The Chen Longshui group of Xie'er Mine was originally the worst of the mine's fifty-two groups. In the recent surge of group competition, the workers of this group set lofty ambitions, set specific goals, and launched a competition with the advanced Zhou Jianmin group, and as a result, became one of the advanced groups in the entire mine. The Red Flag Second Team of Li'yi Mine originally had irregular cycle operations, and the output could not be increased. Later, they sent people to the Second Coal Mining Team of Xie'er Mine to learn the advanced experience of regular multi-cycle operations, and quickly achieved regular multi-cycle operations, becoming a red flag unit in Li'yi Mine.

### 确定“起点”指标　争取逐旬高涨  淮南煤矿两千多小组投入竞赛热潮

    确定“起点”指标　争取逐旬高涨
    淮南煤矿两千多小组投入竞赛热潮
    新华社合肥15日电　淮南煤矿职工以小组为主，掀起了“定起点，步步高”的竞赛热潮，推动煤炭产量大幅度上升。全矿8月下旬的平均日产量比中旬提高8％，9月上旬又比8月下旬提高了5％。
    “定起点、步步高”小组竞赛的主要内容是这样的：各工种的小组根据规定的月度计划和不同的生产条件，订出不同的平均先进集体定额，作为竞赛的“起点”指标，然后掀起超起点、步步高的竞赛。
    “定起点，步步高”的竞赛一开展，各矿两千多个采煤、回柱、运料、掘进和机电等小组就投入了你追我赶的热潮。谢二矿一区采煤二队的周建民小组在竞赛的第一天，就以生产一百一十吨煤的成绩超过了三区采煤十队的张文发小组；收工以后，两个小组立即各自召开会议总结经验，第二天两个小组都把产煤量提高到了一百九十八吨。第三天两个小组更是分秒必争，愈干愈猛，两个小组都用六个多小时的时间完成了当天的生产任务。李一矿职工开展竞赛以后，有三百二十二个小组，突破了“起点”指标。谢三矿职工开展“定起点、步步高”竞赛以后，也经常超额完成生产任务，平均日产量提高17％，掘进进尺提高41％。
    竞赛展开以后，不少原来比较后进的采煤队和小组都很快赶了上来。谢三矿采煤九队原来完成计划情况比较差，竞赛后全队职工积极学习新技术，加大循环进度，改革循环组织，8月下旬以后做到了天天日进双循环，平均日产量迅速提高20％。谢二矿陈龙水小组原是全矿五十二个小组中最差的一个；在最近掀起的小组竞赛热潮中，这个小组的工人树雄心立大志，订出具体奋斗目标，同先进的周建民小组展开了对手赛，结果成了全矿的先进小组之一。李一矿红旗二队原来循环作业不正规，产量上不去；后来派人到谢二矿采煤二队学习了正规多循环作业的先进经验，很快做到了正规多循环作业，并且成了李一矿的一面红旗。
