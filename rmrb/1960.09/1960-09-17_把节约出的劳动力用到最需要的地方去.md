The Third Iron Plant of Fengjie County, Sichuan Province (a small-scale coal and iron joint enterprise), used more than 500 laborers saved through technological innovation and labor organization adjustments to strengthen the front line of production. As a result, the production outlook quickly changed. In about ten days, raw coal increased by nearly one time, coke increased by 42%, ore increased by 25%, and pig iron increased by 84%. The fact that this plant has greatly increased production raises a very universal issue for industrial and mining enterprises, that is, in the current campaign to increase production and practice economy centered on grain and steel, it is extremely important to take practical measures to vigorously save labor and adjust the use of labor.

The work of saving labor in the Fengjie Third Iron Plant started with analyzing the weak links in production. After a period of technological revolution, a new imbalance appeared in the plant's labor arrangement. Before the blast furnace technology was up to standard, more labor was required before and after the furnace. After the implementation of the new technology of high temperature and high air volume, the utilization coefficient of the blast furnace increased, and the supply of raw materials and fuel became a weak link in production by comparison. Therefore, the factory Party committee promptly issued a call to save labor and strengthen the first line of mining. The labor saved was used in the most needed places, and as a result, production increased significantly. This is a very good experience. It tells us that all enterprises should save all the labor that can be saved and use the labor saved in the most needed places. This is an effective measure to carry out the campaign to increase production and practice economy.

Saving all the labor that can be saved is a regular task of socialist enterprises. Since the launch of the movement for technological innovation and technological revolution, the conditions for saving labor have become even better. The staff and workers of the Seventh Engineering Department of the Chengdu Railway Administration once put forward the grand goal of "one worker ten cubic meters, personnel halved." At that time, some people thought this was impossible, saying, "Unless it's a living immortal, and even an immortal needs a mountain-driving whip!" However, most people believed: "Workers are living immortals, and their hands are mountain-driving whips; as long as everyone works hard, even mountains will collapse and rocks will shatter." Sure enough, as a result of making great efforts in the technological revolution, in less than two months, the average work efficiency exceeded ten cubic meters, and more than half of the personnel were saved. From this, it can be seen that the technological revolution has created favorable conditions for saving labor. Many places have formulated plans for saving labor and issued indicators for saving labor when formulating technological revolution plans. According to this year's production leap forward plan, Chongqing originally planned to increase the number of employees by 48,000. Now, not only is it unnecessary to increase this part of the population, but in the past five months, the four departments of industry, capital construction, transportation, and commerce have saved more than 116,900 people. The situation in one city is like this, and the situation in a production unit is the same. From this, it can be seen that the potential of labor is very considerable. With the improvement of the degree of mechanization, semi-mechanization, automation, and semi-automation, the improvement of workers' technical level, and the improvement of management work, it is entirely possible, according to the principle of overall planning, rational use, and ensuring key points, to strengthen the front line of production that urgently needs labor, especially the front line of coal, iron, and ore production, with the labor saved, especially some non-productive personnel. Because these front lines of production are the main battlefields for greatly increasing production, and their strengthening has prepared important conditions for greatly increasing steel production. The reason why the Fengjie Third Iron Plant has achieved a situation of large-scale and high-yield coal, iron, and ore is that there are more people going up the mountains and down the wells, the strength of the front line has been strengthened, ore production has increased, coal and coke production has increased, and the blast furnace is full and well-fed, so the output of pig iron has increased sharply.

Reasonable adjustment of labor also includes correctly handling the relationship between the first and second lines of production. Saving manpower and strengthening the front line of production does not mean that the second line is not important. At any time, the work of the second line of an enterprise cannot be ignored. Industrial production is an organic whole, and there is a close connection between main and auxiliary processes, workshops and departments, and production and non-production personnel. A highly efficient second line of production is essential to ensure the normal progress of production. However, the relationship between the first and second lines is, after all, a relationship of primary and secondary. If too many people are occupied by the second line, this will not only relatively weaken the strength of the first line, but also cause inconvenience in management, waste of manpower, reduced overall work efficiency, and increased production costs. Therefore, in the vigorous campaign to increase production and practice economy, doing everything possible to save all non-production personnel that can be saved is also an important aspect of saving labor. Of course, strengthening the front line does not mean that the more people there are in the front line, the better. The front line must also save manpower as much as possible. Otherwise, too many people in the front line will also cause reduced work efficiency, reduced labor productivity, increased production costs, and waste of personnel. In the mass movement of making great efforts in technological innovation and technological revolution, continuously improving labor productivity and continuously saving labor are still important tasks of the front line of production. Saving more labor from the front line of production and using it in the most needed places is still one of the regular tasks of the enterprise. A lean first line and a highly efficient second line are always the characteristics of socialist enterprises.

It is also a very important aspect to allocate a part of the labor saved by industrial, mining, and transportation enterprises to rural people's communes to participate in agricultural production. As everyone knows, agriculture is the foundation of the national economy. Drawing a part of the labor saved from the industrial and transportation fronts to strengthen the agricultural front can not only increase the rural labor force and promote agricultural production, but also play a great role in promoting the technological transformation of agriculture. The more than 110,000 people saved in Chongqing, more than 30,000 of whom have embarked on the agricultural front, is a very good example. Putting the labor saved in the most needed places, this most needed place includes both industry and agriculture.

The rational arrangement of labor is the most important issue in organizing production. Saving labor is the biggest saving; wasting labor is the biggest waste. One of the important signs of measuring whether an enterprise is well run is whether the use of manpower is economical. Therefore, doing everything possible to save manpower and put labor in the most needed places is one of the most important contents of the current national campaign to increase production and practice economy centered on grain and steel. Leading cadres of all industrial and transportation enterprises must earnestly do this work well.

### 把节约出的劳动力用到最需要的地方去

    把节约出的劳动力用到最需要的地方去
    四川奉节县第三铁厂（小型的煤铁联合企业）把经过技术革新和调整劳动组织节约出来的五百多名劳动力，用来加强生产第一线，结果，生产面貌迅速改观，十天左右，原煤增长将近一倍，焦炭增长42％，矿石增长25％，生铁增长84％。这个厂大幅度增产的事实，向工矿企业提出了一个很有普遍意义的问题，这就是在当前以粮、钢为中心的增产节约运动中，切实采取措施，大力节约劳动力和调整劳动力的使用，是一件十分重要的工作。
    奉节第三铁厂节约劳动力的工作，是从分析生产薄弱环节着手的。经过一段技术革命，这个厂劳动力的安排出现了新的不平衡。在高炉技术没有过关以前，炉前炉后需要较多的劳动力，推行了高温大风的新技术以后，高炉利用系数提高了，相形之下，原料燃料的供应就成了生产的薄弱环节。于是工厂党委及时提出了节约劳动力加强采掘第一线的号召。把节约出的劳动力，用到最需要的地方，结果生产大幅度上升了。这是一个很好的经验，它告诉我们一切企业都应当节约一切可以节约的劳动力，并且把节约出来的劳动力，用到最需要的地方去。这是开展增产节约运动的一个有效措施。
    节约一切可以节约的劳动力，这是社会主义企业的经常工作。自从开展技术革新和技术革命的运动以来，节约劳动力的条件是更好了。成都铁路管理局第七工程处的职工曾提出：“一工十方，人员减半”的宏伟目标。当时有人认为这是不可能的事，说：“除非是活神仙，神仙还要有赶山鞭！”可是多数人认为：“工人就是活神仙，双手就是赶山鞭；只要大家一个劲，指令山崩石头烂。”果然，大闹技术革命的结果，不到两个月，平均工效超过了十方，人员节约了一半多。由此可见，技术革命为节约劳动力创造了有利条件。许多地方在制定技术革命规划的时候，就制定了节约劳动力的规划，下达了节约劳动力的指标。重庆市根据今年的生产跃进计划，原拟增加职工四万八千人。现在不仅这部分人不要增加，而且在五个月当中，工业、基本建设、交通运输、商业四个部门，已经节约出十一万六千九百多人。一个市的情况是如此，一个生产单位的情况同样是如此。由此可见，劳动力的潜力是十分可观的。随着机械化、半机械化、自动化、半自动化程度的提高，工人技术水平的提高，管理工作的改进，完全有可能根据统筹兼顾，合理使用，保证重点的原则，把节省出来的劳动力，特别是一些非生产性人员，去加强那些急需劳动力的生产第一线，特别是煤、铁、矿石生产的第一线。因为这些生产第一线是大幅度增加生产的主要战场，它们加强了，就为大幅度增产钢铁准备了重要条件。奉节第三铁厂所以出现煤、铁、矿大面积高产的局面，就是因为上山下井的人多了，第一线的力量加强了，矿石增产，煤、焦增产，高炉吃得饱吃得好，所以生铁的产量就猛增上去了。
    合理调剂劳动力，还包括了正确处理生产第一线和第二线的关系。节约人力，加强生产第一线，并不是说第二线就不重要，在任何时候，企业第二线的工作都是不容忽视的。工业生产是个有机的整体，主要工序和辅助工序、车间和科室、生产人员和非生产人员之间，是有着紧密的联系的。一个高效率的生产第二线，对保证生产的正常进行，是少不得的。但是，一线和二线之间的关系毕竟是一种主和辅的关系，如果二线人员占用多了，这不仅相对地减弱了第一线的力量，而且还会造成管理不便、人力浪费、降低全员工效、增加生产成本等弊病。因此，在轰轰烈烈的增产节约运动中，千方百计节省一切可以节省的非生产人员，这也是节省劳动力的一个重要方面。当然，加强第一线，并不是说第一线的人越多越好，第一线也必须尽可能节约人力的使用。否则，第一线的人员过多，同样是会造成降低工效、降低劳动生产率、增加生产成本、造成人员浪费的。在大闹技术革新和技术革命的群众运动中，不断提高劳动生产率，不断节约劳动力，仍然是生产第一线的重要任务。从生产第一线节约出更多的劳动力来，用到最需要的地方去，仍然是企业的经常工作之一。精干的第一线，高效率的第二线，这永远是社会主义企业的特色。
    把工矿交通企业节省下来的劳动力的一部分，分配到农村人民公社去参加农业生产，这也是一个十分重要的方面。大家知道，农业是国民经济的基础，从工业交通战线上抽调一部分节约出的人力，去加强农业战线，不仅能增加农村的劳动力，促进农业增产，而且对促进农业的技术改造，也有很大的作用。重庆市节约出的十一万多人，有三万多人走上了农业战线，就是一个很好的榜样。把节省出的劳动力用到最需要的地方去，这个最需要的地方，既包括工业，也包括农业。
    劳动力的合理安排问题，是组织生产的头等重要问题。劳动力的节约，就是最大的节约；劳动力的浪费，就是最大的浪费。衡量一个企业办得好不好，重要的标志之一，是人力的使用是否节约。因此，千方百计节省人力，把劳动力用到最需要的地方去，是当前以粮、钢为中心的全民增产节约运动的最重要的内容之一。一切工业交通企业的领导干部都要切切实实地把这项工作做好。
