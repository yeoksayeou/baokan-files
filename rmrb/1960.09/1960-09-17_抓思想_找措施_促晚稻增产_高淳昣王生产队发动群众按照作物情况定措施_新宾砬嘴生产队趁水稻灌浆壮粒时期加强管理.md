Grasp Ideology, Find Measures, Promote Increased Late Rice Production
　　Gaocun Zhenwang Production Team Mobilizes the Masses to Determine Measures According to Crop Conditions Xinbin Lazui Production Team Strengthens Management During the Rice Filling Stage

　　(Our newspaper, Nanjing, 16th dispatch) Rui Jialong, the Party Branch Secretary of Zhenwang Production Team, Cangxi Commune, Gaocun County, Jiangsu, deeply studied the field with small teams, cadres, and members to formulate a complete set of field management measures to promote increased late rice production based on seedling conditions.

　　On the evening of August 19th, Rui Jialong read with full concentration the People's Daily editorial "Immediately Launch an Increase Production and Thrift Movement Centered on Grain and Steel." According to the requirements of the editorial, he thought that 86% of the rice area in the entire team was late rice, which was in its vigorous growing period. The quality of field management would have a great impact on the autumn harvest.

　　The next day, at the break of dawn, Rui Jialong came to the Fifth Small Team. Rui Jialong asked, "How is the late rice growing? How do you think we should strengthen the later-stage management to strive for high yields?" Some members replied, "This year's rice seedlings are better than last year's, and a bumper harvest is guaranteed..." This conversation made him realize that the members had a sense of complacency and paralysis. He used his rest time to promote the spirit of the People's Daily editorial to the members in the fields. He also quoted the saying that the early stage of late rice management is about managing the weeds, while the later stage is about managing the rice. Currently, there is still more than a month before the late rice harvest, so now is the time to promote increased late rice production, so that everyone realizes the importance of late rice later-stage management and that crop growth has staying power.

　　After raising everyone's awareness, Comrade Rui Jialong also organized team leaders, experienced farmers, young people, and women to hold a field meeting. By examining each plot and classifying them, according to the requirement of "every rice seedling is standardized, every mu achieves actual production beyond the contract," based on the original situation, measures were taken to promote growth based on the seedling conditions. The 329 mu of late rice in the entire small team were basically divided into three categories: The first category is 92 mu of early rice, which is currently in the jointing and booting stage. The fields have generally been dehydrated. It was decided to irrigate more twice, treat pests once more, and take measures to weed once more by dividing the rows to ensure ventilation and light transmission. The second category is 120 mu of late japonica rice, which is turning yellow in some parts due to fertilizer deficiency in the later stage. In addition to management like early rice, a quick-acting fertilizer should be applied universally. The third category is 117 mu of Jiangxi late rice and Xiaohong rice, which were planted late due to waterlogging, and are currently tillering. Because this variety has soft stalks and is prone to lodging, and it is a "cold water field" with low temperature and high acidity, it was determined that irrigation should be dry and wet alternately, and fertilizer should be applied twice, once with slow-release fertilizer and once with wood ash. Weeding and pest control should also be carried out continuously.

　　Comrade Rui Jialong was not satisfied with this general arrangement. The next day, he went deep into the fields and worked with everyone. During the labor, the members reflected that the team's fertilizers and pesticides had been used up in the previous period. Now, more labor is arranged for watering and weeding, and less for topdressing and pest control. Work is crowded together, and there is a serious phenomenon of idleness. Rui Jialong also used the production gap to convene a small team committee to specifically study and formulate a half-month production plan. It was determined that in addition to regular irrigation and pest control, two annihilation battles would be fought within half a month: the first eight days focusing on accumulating and topdressing fertilizer, and the last seven days focusing on weeding. The labor arrangement was also studied, and the responsibility system of dividing areas for contract management and grouping management was adopted, which greatly improved work efficiency.

　　(Our newspaper, Fushun, 16th dispatch) The Lazui Production Team in Xinbin Town, Xinbin County, Liaoning, is seizing the rice's filling and grain-growing stage to further strengthen the late-stage field management of rice.

　　Due to timely rice transplanting, sufficient manure fertilizer, reasonable irrigation, and diligent weeding this year, the rice growth in the Lazui Production Team is generally good. In late August, the county party committee work team went deep into this production team, and the brigade cadres and experienced old farmers adopted the method of on-site inspection and on-site analysis to classify the rice and find out the law of late-stage yield increase potential of rice. Among the 307 mu of paddy fields, after a general survey, analysis, and classification, it was found that first-class seedlings accounted for 15%, these seedlings have large clumps, have already suppressed the vines, and the grains are growing well; second-class seedlings accounted for 63%, these seedlings are filling grains and suppressing the vines, but the field ridge grass has not been completely cut, and the barnyard grass ears have not been completely removed, affecting sunlight and ventilation; third-class seedlings accounted for 22%, and are in the flowering and heading stage. After analysis and research: if more measures are taken for first-class seedlings, the yield will increase; second and third-class seedlings have great potential. After on-site inspection and analysis, the understanding of cadres and the masses was raised, and the idea that there was no prospect for later-stage field management was overcome. It was decided to launch a super-production competition movement to strengthen the late-stage management of rice in the entire brigade.

　　The Lazui Production Team immediately organized 102 members to increase measures, focusing on the second and third-class seedlings to promote their growth and early maturity, under the premise of not loosening the management of first-class seedlings, and launched a rice super-competition movement. Cadres and experienced old farmers led the members to different types of plots according to the rice growth, and took measures to promote their growth. A group of students and women were drawn to extract barnyard grass ears and drain and irrigate the fields of first-class seedlings under the guidance of old farmers, so that the first-class seedlings got sufficient sunlight, and now the grains are full and the ears are slightly yellow. At present, the second and third-class seedlings have generally declined. (Attached picture)

### 抓思想　找措施　促晚稻增产  高淳昣王生产队发动群众按照作物情况定措施  新宾砬嘴生产队趁水稻灌浆壮粒时期加强管理

    抓思想　找措施　促晚稻增产
    高淳昣王生产队发动群众按照作物情况定措施  新宾砬嘴生产队趁水稻灌浆壮粒时期加强管理
    本报南京16日电　江苏高淳县沧溪公社昣王生产队党支部书记芮家龙，深入小队和干部社员研究出整套根据苗情分类促进晚稻增产的田间管理措施。
    8月19日傍晚，芮家龙全神贯注地读了人民日报“立即开展一个以粮、钢为中心的增产节约运动”的社论，根据社论的要求，他联想到，全队有占整个水稻面积86％的晚稻，正是盛长时期，田间管理的好坏对秋季收成影响很大。
    第二天天蒙蒙亮，芮家龙来到了第五小队。芮家龙问：“晚稻长得怎么样？你们看要怎样加强后期管理才能争取高产？”部分社员回答说：“今年稻苗比去年好，丰收十拿九稳；……”这一席谈话，使他发现社员中存在着自满麻痹的思想情绪，他就利用休息的时间，在田头向社员宣传人民日报社论的精神，还引用俗话说：晚稻前期管的是草，后期管的才是稻的道理。而目前离晚稻收获还有一个多月，因此，现在正是促进晚稻增产的时候，使大家认识到晚稻后期管理的重要性和作物生长是有后劲的。
    提高了大家的认识以后，芮家龙同志又组织队长和老农、青年、妇女等一道，开了个田头会议，通过逐丘过堂，分类排队，按照“棵棵稻苗一类化，亩亩实产超包产”的要求，在原有的基础上，根据苗情，看苗促进；全小队三百二十九亩晚稻，基本分三种情况：第一种是九十二亩元稻，目前正在拔节孕穗，田里已经普遍脱水，决定多灌两次水，多治一次虫，同时要采取分行的办法多除一次草，保证通风、透光；第二种是一百二十亩晚粳稻，因后期缺肥，部分已经撒黄，除像元稻一样管理外，还要普施一次速效肥；第三种是因涝晚栽的一百一十七亩江西晚稻和小红稻，目前，正在分蘖发棵。因这种品种的秆子软，容易倒伏，又是“冷水田”，温度低、酸性重，确定灌溉要干干湿湿，追肥两次，一次迟效肥，一次草木灰，耘草、治虫也要不断进行。
    芮家龙同志没有满足这一般化的布置，第二天他又深入田间和大家一道劳动。劳动中，社员们反映，前一时期队里的肥料、药粉已经用光，现在，劳力安排车水、除草的多，追肥治虫的少，工作时拥挤在一块，窝工现象比较严重。芮家龙又利用生产空隙，召开了小队队委会，具体研究制定了半月生产计划。确定除灌溉、治虫经常进行外，半月内打两个歼灭战：前八天以积肥追肥为中心、后七天以耘草为中心，并重点研究了劳力的安排问题。同时，采用划片包干、分组管理的责任制，大大提高了工效。
    本报抚顺16日电　辽宁新宾县新宾镇砬嘴生产队，抓住水稻正在灌浆和长籽粒时期，进一步加强水稻后期田间管理。
    砬嘴生产队的水田由于今年插秧及时，粪肥足，灌溉合理，耘田又勤，水稻生长普遍良好。8月下旬，县委工作组深入这个生产队，和大队干部以及有经验的老农采取就地查看、就地分析的办法，对水稻进行了分类排队，摸出了水稻后期增产的潜力的规律。在三百零七亩水田中，经过普查、分析、分类排队，查出一类苗占15％，这类苗发墩大，已经压蔓，籽粒长的好；二类苗占63％，这类苗正在灌浆压蔓，但田埂草没全割完，稗穗没抽净，影响阳光和通风；三类苗22％，正处在扬花抽穗时期。经过分析研究：一类苗再增加措施，产量有增无减；二、三类苗潜力很大，经过就地查看和分析，提高了干部和群众的认识，克服了后期田间管理没搞头的思想，决定在全大队开展了一个加强水稻后期管理的超产竞赛运动。
    砬嘴生产队立即组织了一百零二名社员，在不松一类苗管理的前提下，以二、三类苗为重点增加措施，促进其生长和早熟，开展了水稻超级竞赛运动。干部和有经验老农分别带领社员到不同类型的地块，按水稻生长情况，采取措施促其成长。抽出一部分学生和妇女，在老农的指导下，对一类苗进行抽稗穗和排水灌田，使一类苗得到了充裕的阳光，现在已长足籽粒、穗稍变黄。目前，二三类禾苗已经普遍下降。（附图片）
