    Sum up and promote late-stage field management experience
    Some late-autumn crops in the Qilipu Production Brigade begin to mature early
    Methods for promoting early maturity in autumn: urgently apply phosphate fertilizer, shallow and deep hoeing, topping at different heights, removing barren plants to mature the soil, early harvesting for later ripening.
    Jinan, September 11th (This newspaper) – The Qilipu Production Brigade of Caocun Commune in Dezhou City, Shandong Province, using a method combining leading cadres, scientific and technical personnel, and experienced farmers, has summarized a set of measures to promote early maturity and increased production of late-autumn corn, enabling late-autumn fields to be planted with wheat ten to fifteen days earlier.
    Of the more than 1,000 mu of land that the Qilipu Production Brigade plans to plant with wheat this year, apart from 230 mu planted with early-autumn crops, which can be planted with "White Dew" wheat on time, the remaining 770 mu are late-autumn corn intercropped with mung beans, which will not mature until between "Autumn Equinox" and "Cold Dew". In order to enable late-autumn fields to also be planted with "White Dew" wheat, the brigade's Party branch, with the specific assistance of the commune Party committee and the Municipal Agricultural Science Research Institute, mobilized the masses to summarize past experiences in promoting early maturity in late-autumn crops. The main methods are as follows:
      (1) Urgently apply phosphate fertilizer. When the corn is approaching maturity during the transition from summer to autumn, dig trenches or holes and apply 15 to 20 jin of phosphate fertilizer per mu to promote early ripening of the kernels. At the same time, phosphate fertilizer applied to the field is not easily lost and can also promote the development of wheat seedlings.
      (2) Shallow and deep hoeing. When the silk of the corn cobs is half-dry and turning purple, a shallow hoeing can be done to weed and loosen the soil, increase the soil temperature, and facilitate early grain filling. Another deep hoeing is done before the kernels are wax-ripe. At this time, the kernels are basically mature and do not affect corn production.
      (3) Topping at different heights. "High topping" is to remove the tassels from the top of the corn stalks individually after pollination, when the tassels have generally changed from yellow to red, as they have lost their function. "Low topping" is to cut off the upper half of the stalk at the waist of the uppermost cob when the corn kernels are dry and hard. Both of these toppings can concentrate moisture and nutrients to better meet the needs of grain filling and kernel formation.
      (4) Remove barren plants to mature the soil. Currently, corn has entered the maturity stage. All barren plants that cannot form cobs must be removed. For early-maturing plants in the entire field, each mature plant should be harvested to ensure ventilation and light transmission during the later stages of corn growth.
      (5) Early harvesting for later ripening. Around "White Dew", when the vast majority of corn has matured, even if individual weak plants have not fully matured, they should be harvested and tied together in bundles, and stood upright in loosened, watered soil to promote later ripening. Several years of practice have proven that this does not affect yield.
    For corn intercropped with mung beans, corresponding measures should also be taken to promote early maturity of the mung beans when the corn matures early. In this regard, first, remove the grass around the roots of the mung beans in a timely manner to ensure ventilation and light transmission, and reduce nutrient loss. In the later stages of growth, top the excessively long bean stalks to ensure that moisture and nutrients are concentrated on the green pods and grains.
    In order to ensure the realization of the crop early maturity plan, the brigade formed a "Late-Autumn Corn Early Maturity Guidance Group" headed by the Party branch secretary, with the participation of experienced farmers and scientific and technical personnel, and arranged for a 120-person professional team for late-autumn corn field management. Currently, this team has shallow-hoed 1,100 mu of corn once, of which 500 mu have been top-dressed with granular phosphate fertilizer. At the same time, the plants have been generally pruned, crazy branches have been removed, and barren plants have been pulled out; for some of the pollinated plants, the tassels have been removed. After an on-site observation by the guidance group on August 26, 10% of the late-autumn fields that have undergone the above measures have shown the effect of early maturity.

    总结推广后期田间管理经验
    七里铺生产大队部分晚秋作物开始早熟
    促秋早熟办法：急追磷肥，浅深两锄，高低去顶，去空刨熟，早刨后熟
    本报济南11日电　山东德州市曹村公社七里铺生产大队，以领导干部、科学技术人员和老农三结合的办法，总结出一套促使晚秋玉米早熟增产的措施，能使晚秋田提前十至十五天倒茬种麦。
    七里铺生产大队，今年准备播种小麦的一千多亩地中，除二百三十亩是早秋作物，可以按时种“白露”麦外，其余七百七十亩都是绿豆间作的晚秋玉米，要在“秋分”和“寒露”之间才能成熟。大队党支部为了使晚秋田也能种“白露”麦，在公社党委和市农业科学研究所的具体协助下，发动群众总结了过去促进晚秋早熟的经验。主要办法有这样几个：
      （一）急追磷肥。当夏秋之交，玉米已接近成熟时，挑沟或挖穴，每亩追施磷质肥料十五到二十斤，促使籽粒提早成熟。同时磷肥施在田里不易流失，还能促进小麦幼苗的发育。
      （二）浅深两锄。在玉米棒的红缨半干发紫时，可浅锄一遍，这样可以锄草松土，提高地温，有利于早结实。在籽粒腊熟前再进行一次深锄，这时籽粒基本成熟，不影响玉米增产。
      （三）高低去顶。“高去顶”是在玉米授粉后缨子普遍由黄变红，这时顶部雄穗已失去作用，可逐棵将雄穗摘去；“低去顶”是等玉米籽粒发干发硬时，就在最上面一个棒子的腰部，将上半截秸秆剪去。这两次去顶都可使水分、养分更集中地满足籽粒灌浆和结实的需要。
      （四）去空刨熟。目前玉米已进入成熟期，凡不能结棒的空棵，要一律拔去。对在整块大田中早熟的株棵，熟一棵刨一棵，以保证玉米生长后期通风透光。
      （五）早刨后熟。当“白露”前后，绝大部分玉米已成熟，个别瘦弱株棵还没有十成熟，也应一起收刨，将这部分瘦弱玉米集中捆绑，竖立在松过土、泼过水的地方，以促其后熟。几年的实践证明，这样做并不影响产量。
    和绿豆间作的玉米，当玉米提前成熟后，也要相应地采取措施，使绿豆早成熟。在这方面，首先要给绿豆及时拔除护根草，使其通风透光，减少养分损失。在生长后期，对个别狂长豆棵要打边心，以保证水分、养分集中攻青荚豆粒。
    为保证实现作物早熟的计划，大队以支部书记为首，吸收老农、科学技术人员参加，组成了一个“促使晚秋玉米早熟指导小组”，安排了一百二十人的晚秋玉米田间管理专业队。目前，这个队已将一千一百亩玉米浅锄了一遍，其中有五百亩已追施了磷质颗粒肥，同时普遍整修了株棵，铲去疯杈拔掉空棵；对部分已授过粉的株棵，摘去了雄穗。经过指导小组8月26日实地观察，经过上述措施的晚秋田，已有10％的株棵收到早熟成效。
