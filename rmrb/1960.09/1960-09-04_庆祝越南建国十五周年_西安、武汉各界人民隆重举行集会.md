Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, September 2nd: A grand rally was held in Xi'an on the afternoon of September 1st by people from all walks of life to celebrate the 15th anniversary of the founding of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. Attending the celebration were responsible persons from the Party, government, and military of Shaanxi Province and Xi'an City, responsible persons from various democratic parties and people's organizations, as well as representatives from workers, peasants, students, and other sectors, totaling over a thousand people.

All Vietnamese students in Xi'an, the head of the German Democratic Republic experts, and the representative of Czechoslovakian experts also attended the celebration.

Zhao Shouyi, alternate secretary of the Shaanxi Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, spoke at the meeting. He described in detail the great achievements made by the Vietnamese people in various fields under the leadership of the Vietnamese Labor Party over the past fifteen years, and exposed the criminal acts of US imperialism in trampling on and undermining the Geneva Accords, obstructing the peaceful reunification of Vietnam, and turning South Vietnam into a US military base and colony. He said: All these facts fully prove that the aggressive nature of imperialism will not change. Despite the existence of international peace agreements, they still try to undermine them in every possible way. The US imperialists are not only the enemy of Vietnam's peaceful reunification, but also the root cause of instability in Indochina and the most ferocious enemy of peace in Asia and the world. We must wage a persistent struggle against US imperialism.

Zhao Shouyi said that the struggle of the 25 million Vietnamese people for the peaceful reunification of their motherland will surely achieve final victory. The friendship between the Chinese and Vietnamese people is eternal and unbreakable.

Vietnamese student representative Du Wenfang also spoke.

Their speeches were constantly met with warm applause. After the meeting, the Vietnamese film "Excerpts from the Revolutionary Activities of President Ho Chi Minh" was shown.

Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, September 3rd: More than 1,200 people from all walks of life in Hubei Province and Wuhan City held a grand rally on the evening of September 2nd to celebrate the 15th anniversary of the founding of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam.

Attending the celebration were Zhang Tixue, Secretary of the Hubei Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and Governor of Hubei Province, Meng Futang, Deputy Governor of Hubei Province, Sun Yaohua, Xiong Fei, and Wu Nengguang, Deputy Mayors of Wuhan, and responsible persons from provincial and municipal people's organizations. All Vietnamese students and interns in Wuhan also attended the meeting.

Zhang Tixue, on behalf of the people of Hubei Province and Wuhan City, warmly congratulated the heroic Vietnamese people on their festival. He warmly praised the great victories achieved by the hardworking and brave Vietnamese people in the struggle against imperialism and in socialist revolution and socialist construction. He said that the Vietnamese people have made great achievements in politics, economy, culture, education, and other fields since the victory of the anti-French war in 1954, and these achievements have a huge inspirational effect on the Chinese people. Zhang Tixue pointed out that US imperialism is the root cause of the poverty and suffering of the people in South Vietnam today, the mortal enemy of Vietnam's peaceful reunification, and the greatest threat to peace in Indochina. He said that the current international situation is one where the East wind continues to prevail over the West wind, and we are convinced that the victorious Vietnamese people, under the leadership of the glorious Vietnamese Labor Party and President Ho Chi Minh, will surely achieve even more brilliant achievements in socialist construction and the struggle against imperialism. Zhang Tixue also said that the fraternal friendship between the Chinese and Vietnamese people, formed in the common struggle, is promoting the common prosperity and upsurge of construction in our two countries.
