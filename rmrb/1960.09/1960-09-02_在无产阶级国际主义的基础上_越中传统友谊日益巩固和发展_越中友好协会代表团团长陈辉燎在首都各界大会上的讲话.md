Xinhua News Agency, September 1st. Comrade Dong Biwu, Vice Chairman of the People's Republic of China, Comrade Zhou Enlai, Premier of the State Council, Comrade Bo Yibo, Vice Premier of the State Council, Comrade Yang Xiufeng, President of the Sino-Vietnamese Friendship Association, dear comrades:

First of all, let us tell you all the joy and excitement in our hearts without reservation. In 1960, to commemorate the major historical events of the Vietnamese nation, we are living in a series of great festivals: the 30th anniversary of the founding of the working class party - the Indochinese Communist Party, that is, today's Vietnam Labor Party, the 70th birthday of President Ho Chi Minh, the great leader of the Vietnam Labor Party and the Vietnamese people of all ethnic groups, and the Third National Congress of the Vietnam Labor Party will also open in early September. And now, the people of the whole country are commemorating the September 2nd National Day - the birthday of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam with infinite joy. Today, in the great Chinese capital of Beijing, when we see the representatives of all strata of the fraternal Chinese people so warmly and solemnly holding the celebration of the 15th anniversary of Vietnam's National Day, the emotion in our hearts is indescribable. Not only in Beijing, but also in many other big cities, celebrations are held in various forms. It can be said that the joy of the 28 million Vietnamese people is the joy of the 650 million Chinese people, and it is also the joy of the one billion people of the socialist countries in the world. This is the most vivid and profound manifestation of proletarian internationalism and the deep friendship between the peoples of Vietnam and China. On behalf of the Vietnam-China Friendship Association and the Vietnamese people, we would like to extend our deepest respect to the comrades and delegates attending the conference!

We all recognize the historical fact that the Democratic Republic of Vietnam is a close friend of the People's Republic of China. Although it is only fifteen years old, the friendship between our two peoples has a history of thousands of years. Since the mid-nineteenth century, when Western capitalism invaded the East and plundered the market, Vietnam became a colony, and China became a semi-colony. The peoples of Vietnam and China faced a common enemy - imperialism. After the October Revolution in the Soviet Union, the Communist Party of China was born in 1921, and then the Indochinese Communist Party was established in 1930, and it took absolute revolutionary leadership in Vietnam. Since then, the inherent friendship between our two peoples has been further consolidated and developed on the basis of proletarian internationalism. The August General Uprising in 1945 enabled the Vietnamese people to seize power, while weakening a part of the imperialist group, and preventing them from using Vietnam as a springboard to attack the Chinese revolution. In 1949, the success of the Chinese revolution not only liberated the people of mainland China, freeing them from the shackles of imperialism and their running dogs of feudalism and bureaucrat-comprador capitalism, but also contributed to the early victory of the Vietnamese people's war of resistance. The relationship between the peoples of Vietnam and China is just like the familiar analogy of "lips and teeth are interdependent." Today, under the leadership of the Party and the working class, this relationship has become extremely close. Our two countries are adjacent to each other, have a common socialist system, and our two peoples are advancing side by side on the socialist road. Our friendship is deeper than ever.

Just now, our ambassador introduced the main achievements of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam in the past fifteen years. However, when it comes to the above-mentioned achievements, in addition to the efforts and struggles of our people themselves, we will never forget the great assistance given by the socialist camp countries headed by the Soviet Union; we will never forget the important assistance that China has given us in the construction of industry and agriculture, transportation, culture and education in Vietnam. China has helped and is helping us build many factories and enterprises, such as: Thong Nhat Match Factory, Viet Tri and Yi An Power Plants, Paper Mills, Sugar Refineries, and 14 Rice Mills, 16 Consumer Goods Manufacturing Plants, Taiyuan Iron and Steel Joint Plant, as well as secondary railway schools, industrial schools, transportation, agriculture and forestry, postal and telecommunications schools and equipment for ships and trains. In addition, it also provides good equipment for Vietnam's water conservancy, engineering, postal and telecommunications, radio stations, experimental research institutes, and farms. The Chinese people have also sent many outstanding experts to Vietnam to help us train a large number of technical cadres and skilled workers. The Vietnamese people are very grateful for this and highly appreciate the help and generosity of great brother China. Therefore, when it comes to the achievements of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, we must talk about the spirit of self-reliance of the Vietnamese people, and also talk about the great assistance of China and other fraternal countries. At today's conference, on behalf of the Vietnamese people, we would like to express our heartfelt gratitude to the great Communist Party of China, the Chinese government, and the Chinese people.

It is very obvious that such selfless help is only possible from the spirit of proletarian internationalism and the friendship between nations. It has nothing in common with the "aid methods" of US imperialism to various backward countries, that is, attempting to make those countries that receive aid into disguised colonies. The assistance of fraternal China to the socialist construction in northern Vietnam also stems from the fact that our two brotherly neighbors have the same fate and are embarking on a common path. Therefore, the friendship between our two peoples is inseparable from the glorious future of our two peoples. Of course, when talking about Vietnam and China, we must closely link it with the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union. The inherent friendship between our Vietnamese and Chinese peoples is constantly gaining far-reaching development on the basis of the increasingly widespread socialist system in the world.

As comrades have seen, the Vietnamese people are facing two tasks: building socialism in northern Vietnam and fighting for the reunification of the motherland. The peoples of Vietnam and China are today confronting the common enemy, US imperialism. This is not a historical coincidence, but because US imperialism supports its running dog Chiang Kai-shek in Taiwan and its running dog Ngo Dinh Diem in southern Vietnam to obstruct China from liberating its own territory of Taiwan and to obstruct the reunification of Vietnam. While they are turning southern Vietnam into a disguised colony and military base, US imperialism is plotting to re-ignite the war and attack the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and the People's Republic of China. When the Vietnamese people are carrying out the above two major tasks, they are not isolated and helpless. The Vietnamese people have the support of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, and the Vietnamese people have the support of the great neighbor China - which has spent hard and glorious days with us, and today is a comrade-in-arms advancing side by side on the socialist road. These are extremely reliable guarantees that Vietnam will surely win unification and that the construction of socialism will surely succeed. Therefore, when we celebrate the August Revolution in Vietnam and the 15th anniversary of the founding of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, comrades must feel the same excitement as we do, because the revolutionary cause and the cause of building socialism are our common cause. Similarly, when we see the great leap forward achievements China has made in the process of building socialism, we regard these victories as the common victory of our revolutionary cause and the common victory of our socialist camp. We will always remember what Premier Zhou Enlai said during his visit to Vietnam in May 1960: "...The Vietnamese people are a heroic people with a long tradition of anti-imperialist struggle. We believe that with the strong support of the powerful socialist camp and all peace-loving people and countries, the just cause of the Vietnamese people to strive for the peaceful reunification of their motherland will surely achieve the final victory."

Indeed, the final victory of the Vietnamese people is the result of the Vietnamese people's courageous struggle, and it is inseparable from the great assistance of the socialist camp and the assistance of peace-loving and justice-loving people in the world.

Comrades, friends:

Born in the August Revolution, the Democratic Republic of Vietnam is only fifteen years old today, which is the vigorous and promising socialist youth. Under the leadership of the Vietnam Labor Party, northern Vietnam is preparing to enter the first five-year plan. Therefore, China's experience in socialist transformation and socialist construction is infinitely precious to us. Your completion of the main production targets of the second five-year plan three years ahead of schedule is a great encouragement to us. The "Ten Thousand Li Divine Shoes" is an ancient myth, but today, under the glorious illumination of the general line put forward by the Communist Party of China, the Chinese people are turning it into reality with the ingenious leap forward steps. The achievements of the Great Leap Forward have transformed China from a backward agricultural country into a country with a modern industrial foundation, and have significantly improved the living standards of the Chinese people.

The peoples of China and Vietnam have a long tradition of friendship, and we are jointly building a socialism that guarantees the growing development and consolidation of friendship between all peoples. The imperialist groups and their running dogs, who are capable of undermining the friendship between nations, are suffering defeat. The cheers of "Long live the unbreakable friendship between the peoples of Vietnam and China" and "Long live the unity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union" are resounding across the lands of Vietnam and China.

Dear comrades and friends:

This is our goal, this is the most sincere voice of the same rhythm from our hearts.

What a wonderful friendship!

How sublime is socialism!

On behalf of the Vietnam-China Friendship Association and on behalf of the Vietnamese people, we would like to express our sincere gratitude once again to the great Chinese people for their great help to us, and congratulate the Chinese people on their increasingly brilliant victories in socialist construction.

Long live the unbreakable friendship between the peoples of Vietnam and China!

Long live the unity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union!

Long live the great Communist Party of China headed by Comrade Mao Zedong!

Long live world peace!

    在无产阶级国际主义的基础上
    越中传统友谊日益巩固和发展
    越中友好协会代表团团长陈辉燎在首都各界大会上的讲话
    新华社1日讯　越中友好协会代表团团长陈辉燎在首都各界庆祝越南民主共和国成立十五周年大会上的讲话敬爱的中华人民共和国副主席董必武同志，敬爱的周恩来总理同志，敬爱的薄一波副总理同志，敬爱的中越友好协会会长杨秀峰同志，亲爱的同志们：
    首先让我们把充满着我们内心的喜悦和兴奋之情一无遗漏的告诉各位。1960年，为纪念越南民族重大的历史性事件，我们生活在一系列伟大的节日里：工人阶级政党——印度支那共产党，即今天的越南劳动党成立三十周年，越南劳动党和越南各族人民的伟大领袖胡志明主席七十寿辰，越南劳动党第三次全国代表大会也将于9月初开幕。而现在，全国人民正怀着无限欢乐的心情来纪念九·二国庆节——越南民主共和国的生日。今天在伟大的中国首都北京，当我们看到兄弟般的中国人民的各阶层代表如此热烈而隆重地来举行越南国庆十五周年庆祝大会，我们内心的感动是难以形容的。不仅仅是在北京，而且在其他许多大城市也以各种形式来进行庆祝活动。可以说，二千八百万越南人民的欢乐就是六亿五千万中国人民的欢乐，同时也是世界上十亿社会主义国家的人民的欢乐。这是无产阶级国际主义精神和越中两国人民深厚友谊的最鲜明和最深刻的表现。我们谨代表越中友好协会和越南人民向参加大会的同志们、各位代表们致以最深切的敬意！
    我们都承认这样的一个历史事实：越南民主共和国是中华人民共和国亲密的朋友，它虽然刚满十五岁，但是，我们两国人民之间的友谊已有千年历史。自十九世纪中叶，西方资本主义窜入东方，掠夺市场，越南便成为一个殖民地，而中国也变为一个半殖民地，越中两国人民都面对着一个共同的敌人——帝国主义。苏联十月革命以后，1921年中国共产党诞生了，接着1930年印度支那共产党成立，并且在越南掌握了绝对的革命领导权。从那时候起，我们两国人民间固有的友谊又在无产阶级国际主义的基础上进一步地巩固和发展。1945年8月总起义使越南人民夺取了政权，同时，削弱了帝国主义集团的一部分力量，并且使它们不能再利用越南作为进攻中国革命的跳板。1949年，中国革命取得成功，这不仅解放了中国大陆的人民，使他们挣脱了帝国主义和它们的走狗封建主义、官僚买办资本主义集团的枷锁，而且对越南人民抗战早日取得胜利作出贡献。越中两国人民的关系，正如我们所熟悉的比喻“唇齿相依”，那么，今天在党和工人阶级的领导下，这种关系变得无比密切。我们两国国土毗连，有着共同的社会主义制度，我们两国人民并肩沿着社会主义大道前进，我们的友谊是比任何时候都要深厚。
    刚才，我们的大使同志曾就越南民主共和国十五年来取得的主要成就作了介绍。可是，一提到上述的成就，除了我国人民自身的努力奋斗以外，我们不论什么时候都不会忘记以苏联为首的社会主义阵营各国给予的巨大帮助；我们不论什么时候都不会忘记中国在越南的工农业、交通运输、文化教育建设各方面给予我们的重要帮助。中国已经帮助和正在帮助我们建设许多工厂企业，如：统一火柴厂、越池和宜安的发电厂、造纸厂、制糖厂和十四个碾米厂、十六个消费品制造厂、太原联合炼钢厂，以及中等铁道学校、工业学校、交通、农林、邮电等学校和轮船、火车的设备。此外还给越南的水利、工程、邮电、广播电台、试验院、农场等以良好的装备。中国人民还派出许多优秀的专家来到越南帮助我们培养大批技术干部和熟练工人。越南人民对此感到非常感激，对伟大的兄弟中国的帮助和慷慨无私的精神予以很高的评价。所以，一谈到越南民主共和国的成就，就要谈到越南人民的自力更生的精神，同时也要谈到中国和各兄弟国家的巨大帮助。在今天的大会上，我们谨代表越南人民向伟大的中国共产党、中国政府和中国人民表示衷心的感谢。
    十分明显，这种无私的帮助只有从无产阶级国际主义精神和各民族之间的友谊出发才有可能。它和美帝国主义对各个落后国家的“援助方式”，即企图使那些接受援助的国家成为一个变相的殖民地是毫无共同之处的。兄弟般的中国对我们越南北方社会主义建设的帮助还出于我们两个兄弟邻邦有着相同的命运和走上共同的道路。所以，我们两国人民之间的友谊是和我们两国人民的光辉前途分不开的。当然，谈起越南，谈起中国，我们必须密切地联系到以苏联为首的社会主义阵营，我们越中两国人民固有的友谊正是在世界上日益广泛发展的社会主义体系的基础上，不断地获得深远的发展。
    像同志们所看到的，越南人民面对着两个任务：在越南北方建设社会主义，和为祖国的统一而进行斗争。越中两国人民今天在对抗着共同的敌人美帝国主义，这并不是历史的偶然的凑合，这是由于美帝国主义扶植它们在台湾的走狗蒋介石和在越南南方的走狗吴庭艳来阻挠中国解放自己的领土台湾，和阻挠越南的统一。当他们在把越南南方变为一个变相的殖民地和军事基地的时候，美帝国主义正图谋重新挑起战争，进攻越南民主共和国和中华人民共和国。越南人民在实现上述两大任务的时候，并不是孤立无援的，越南人民有了以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的支持，越南人民有了伟大的邻邦中国——它和我们一起度过艰苦的和光荣的日子，而今天又是在社会主义大路上并肩前进的战友的支持。这些是越南一定赢得统一和建设社会主义一定成功的极其可靠的保障。因此，在我们庆祝越南八月革命，庆祝越南民主共和国建国十五周年的时候，同志们一定和我们同样感到非常兴奋，因为革命事业，建设社会主义事业是我们共同的事业。同样当我们看到中国在建设社会主义过程中所获得的大跃进的成就，我们就把这些胜利看成是我们革命事业的共同胜利，看成是我们社会主义阵营的共同胜利。我们永远记着1960年5月间，周恩来总理访问越南时所说的话：“……越南人民是有长期反帝斗争传统的英雄人民。我们相信，在强大的社会主义阵营和一切爱好和平的人民和国家的大力支援下，越南人民争取和平统一祖国的正义事业一定能够获得最后的胜利。”
    的确如此，越南人民的最后胜利是越南人民奋勇斗争的结果，同时是和社会主义阵营的巨大帮助以及世界上爱好和平和正义的人们的帮助分不开的。
    同志们、朋友们：
    诞生于八月革命的越南民主共和国今天刚满十五周岁，这正是朝气蓬勃前途灿烂的社会主义的青春年代。在越南劳动党的领导下，越南北方正准备跨入第一个五年计划。因此，中国社会主义改造和社会主义建设的经验，对我们来说是无限珍贵的。你们提前三年完成第二个五年计划的主要生产指标，对我们是一个很大的鼓舞。“万里神鞋”是古代的一个神话，可是今天，在中国共产党所提出的总路线的光辉照耀下，中国人民正在以奇巧的大跃进的步伐把它变为现实。大跃进的成就使得中国从一个落后的农业国变为一个具有现代工业基础的国家，并且使中国人民的生活水平得到显著的提高。
    中越两国人民具有悠久的传统友谊，我们正在共同建设一个保证各国人民的友谊日益发展和巩固的社会主义。以破坏各民族友谊为能事的帝国主义集团及其走狗们正遭受溃败。“越中人民牢不可破的友谊万岁”和“以苏联为首的社会主义阵营团结一致万岁”的欢呼声，正在越南和中国的土地上响彻云霄。
    亲爱的同志们，朋友们：
    这是我们的奋斗目标，这是我们出自心坎里的同一个节奏的最恳切的声音。
    多么美好的友谊！
    多么崇高的社会主义！
    我们谨代表越中友好协会，代表越南人民再一次地向伟大的中国人民给予我们巨大的帮助表示真诚的感谢，并祝贺中国人民的社会主义建设日益取得辉煌的胜利。
    越中两国人民牢不可破的友谊万岁！
    以苏联为首的社会主义阵营团结一致万岁！
    以毛泽东同志为首的伟大的中国共产党万岁！
    世界和平万岁！
