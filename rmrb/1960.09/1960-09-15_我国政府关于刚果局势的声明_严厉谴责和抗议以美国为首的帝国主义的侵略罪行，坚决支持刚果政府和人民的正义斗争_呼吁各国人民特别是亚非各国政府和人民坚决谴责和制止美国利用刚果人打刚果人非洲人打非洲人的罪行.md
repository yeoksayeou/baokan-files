Xinhua News Agency, September 14th—Statement of the Government of the People's Republic of China on the Situation in the Congo. The full text is as follows:

The aggression and intervention carried out by imperialism headed by the United States against the Republic of the Congo under the banner of the United Nations has made the situation in the Congo increasingly serious. On September 6, the "United Nations forces" manipulated by the United States forcibly occupied the Congolese National Radio Station and airports in various places, prohibiting the legitimate government headed by Prime Minister Lumumba from using them. US imperialism has also been using Congolese separatists to constantly carry out conspiracies to subvert the Congolese central government. These aggressive crimes of US imperialism not only seriously threaten the national independence of the Congo and African countries, but also seriously threaten peace in Africa, Asia, and the world. These heinous activities of the United States have aroused great indignation and strong resistance from the Congolese government and the Congolese people. The Chinese government and the Chinese people sternly condemn and protest the blatant and shameless aggression and intervention crimes committed by imperialism headed by the United States against the Congo, and resolutely support the just struggle of the Congolese government and the Congolese people against imperialism and safeguarding national independence and national unity.

US imperialism has been using the name of the United Nations to carry out a conspiracy to annex the Congo. As early as August 17, US President Eisenhower smeared the Congolese government’s opposition to the US’s use of "United Nations forces" to interfere in the Congo's just actions as "irresponsible behavior," and threatened that the US government would fully support the United Nations in "handling" the so-called "chaotic situation" in the Congo. Hammarskjöld, who listened to the command of US imperialism, brazenly interfered in the internal affairs of the Congo, creating divisions in the Congo, unreasonably disarming the Congolese army, forcibly ordering "United Nations forces" to occupy the Congolese National Radio Station and airports in various places, and openly supported the arrogant act of dissolving the Lumumba government. The facts are already very clear. The conspiracy of US imperialism in the Congo is to use Congolese to fight Congolese, and Africans to fight Africans, creating division between the Congo and Africa, so that the Congolese people and the African people kill each other, so that US imperialism can invade the Congo and invade Africa, in order to realize its ambition to annex the Congo and encompass Africa.

However, this vicious conspiracy of US imperialism is being exposed more and more. The people of the Congo and other African countries are increasingly recognizing the true face of US imperialism and are actively rising up to oppose US imperialism. The central government of the Congo has repeatedly issued serious condemnations and protests against the aggressive activities carried out by the United Nations under the manipulation of the United States in the Congo. On September 9, the headquarters of the Guinean troops stationed in the Congo announced that Guinea had decided to temporarily withdraw its troops from the United Nations forces until the United Nations no longer interfered in Congolese affairs. On September 12, the government of the United Arab Republic sternly accused the United Nations Command in the Congo of infringing on Congolese sovereignty and announced the withdrawal of the United Arab Republic troops from the United Nations forces. On September 13, Ghanaian President Nkrumah pointed out that Ghana's troops in the Congo were almost entirely used to oppose the Lumumba government and announced that if the legitimate government of Lumumba was not allowed to use its own radio station, Ghana would immediately withdraw its troops from the United Nations Command. The Chinese government warmly welcomes and resolutely supports the solemn positions taken by the governments of the aforementioned countries. The Chinese government and people appeal to the people of all countries in the world, especially the governments and people of Asia and Africa, hoping that they will quickly take effective measures to resolutely support the just struggle of the Congolese people and the government of the Republic of the Congo to safeguard national independence and national unity, and resolutely condemn and stop the US imperialist crime of using Congolese to fight Congolese and Africans to fight Africans.

The Chinese government and people will unswervingly and resolutely support the just struggle of the government of the Republic of the Congo and the heroic Congolese people against imperialism and to safeguard national independence and national unity, and believe that the imperialist bloc headed by US imperialism must immediately return the Congolese National Radio Station and airports to the Congolese government, and immediately stop all conspiracies to invade, interfere, divide, and annex the Congo and Africa.

The Chinese government and people firmly believe that as long as the Congolese people unite, the African people unite, and the people of the world unite, and resolutely fight to the end against the imperialist bloc headed by US imperialism and its running dogs, their conspiracies to invade, interfere, divide, and annex the Congo and Africa will surely be completely defeated, and the struggle of the Congolese and African people for complete independence will surely be completely victorious.

    我国政府关于刚果局势的声明
    严厉谴责和抗议以美国为首的帝国主义的侵略罪行，坚决支持刚果政府和人民的正义斗争
    呼吁各国人民特别是亚非各国政府和人民坚决谴责和制止美国利用刚果人打刚果人非洲人打非洲人的罪行
    新华社14日讯　中华人民共和国政府关于刚果局势的声明。全文如下：
    以美国为首的帝国主义，打着联合国旗号，对刚果共和国进行的侵略和干涉活动，使得刚果的局势越来越严重化。9月6日，在美国操纵下的“联合国军”竟强占刚果国家电台和各地机场，禁止以卢蒙巴总理为首的合法政府使用。美帝国主义还利用刚果分裂分子不断地进行颠覆刚果中央政府的阴谋。美帝国主义的这些侵略罪行，不但严重地威胁着刚果和非洲各国的民族独立，而且也严重地威胁着非洲、亚洲和世界的和平。美国的这些罪恶活动激起了刚果政府、刚果人民极大的愤慨和强烈的反抗。中国政府和中国人民严厉地谴责和抗议以美国为首的帝国主义对刚果所进行的蛮横无耻的侵略和干涉罪行，坚决支持刚果政府和刚果人民反对帝国主义、维护民族独立和国家统一的正义斗争。
    美帝国主义一直在利用联合国的名义进行鲸吞刚果的阴谋。早在8月17日，美国总统艾森豪威尔就诬蔑刚果政府反对美国利用“联合国军”干涉刚果的正义行动是“不负责任的行为”，并且威胁说，美国政府将全力支持联合国“处理”所谓刚果的“混乱局面”。听从美帝国主义指挥的哈马舍尔德蛮横地干涉刚果内政，在刚果制造分裂，无理地解除刚果军队的武装；强令“联合国军”占领刚果国家电台和各地机场；并且公然支持解散卢蒙巴政府的狂妄行为。事实已经很清楚，美帝国主义在刚果的阴谋，是用刚果人打刚果人，用非洲人打非洲人，制造刚果和非洲的分裂，使刚果人民和非洲人民自相残杀，从而使美帝国主义得以侵入刚果，侵入非洲，以实现其鲸吞刚果和囊括非洲的野心。
    但是，美帝国主义的这个恶毒阴谋，越来越被揭穿了。刚果和其他非洲国家的人民越来越认清美帝国主义的真面目，并且积极地起来反对美帝国主义了。刚果的中央政府对美国操纵下的联合国在刚果所进行的侵略活动已经多次提出严正的谴责和抗议。9月9日，几内亚驻刚果部队司令部宣布几内亚决定暂时把军队从联合国军中撤出，一直到联合国不再干涉刚果事务为止。9月12日，阿拉伯联合共和国政府严正地指责了联合国驻刚果司令部侵犯刚果主权，并且宣布从联合国军中撤出阿拉伯联合共和国部队。9月13日，加纳总统恩克鲁玛指出加纳在刚果的部队几乎完全被利用来反对卢蒙巴政府，并且宣布如果不准许卢蒙巴合法政府使用自己的电台，加纳将立即从联合国军司令部中撤出它的部队。中国政府热烈欢迎并且坚决支持上述各国政府所采取的严正立场。中国政府和人民向世界各国人民、特别是向亚非各国政府和人民呼吁，希望他们迅速采取有效措施，坚决支持刚果人民和刚果共和国政府为维护民族独立和国家统一而进行的正义斗争，坚决谴责和制止美帝国主义利用刚果人打刚果人，利用非洲人打非洲人的罪行。
    中国政府和人民将始终不渝地、坚决地支持刚果共和国政府和英勇的刚果人民反对帝国主义，维护民族独立和国家统一的正义斗争，并且认为以美帝国主义为首的帝国主义集团必须立即把刚果国家电台和机场，交还给刚果政府，立即停止侵略、干涉、分裂刚果和非洲的一切阴谋活动。
    中国政府和人民深信，只要刚果人民团结起来、非洲人民团结起来、全世界人民团结起来，坚决地同以美帝国主义为首的帝国主义集团及其走狗斗争到底，它们的侵略、干涉、分裂和鲸吞刚果和非洲的阴谋，一定会彻底失败，刚果和非洲人民争取完全独立的斗争一定会彻底胜利。1960年9月14日
