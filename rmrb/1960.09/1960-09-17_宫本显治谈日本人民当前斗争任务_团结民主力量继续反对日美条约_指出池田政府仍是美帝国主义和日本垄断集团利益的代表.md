Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, September 15th: According to TASS, Moscow, September 14th: Kenji Miyamoto, Secretary-General of the Japanese Communist Party, published an article in the Soviet "Pravda" stating: "Now our important task is to unite with all democratic forces to deal a fatal blow to the new Japan-U.S. 'Security Treaty' in the Diet elections. All the party's strength is now being used to complete this task."

In the article, he introduced the current stage of the struggle against the Japan-U.S. military alliance. The author mentioned that two months have passed since the ruling groups of Japan and the United States "approved" the new "Security Treaty." During this period, they have been striving to use all possible means to heal the wounds they suffered in the struggle with the people and create a situation favorable to themselves.

Miyamoto emphasized that the Ikeda government, which succeeded the Nobusuke Kishi government, is still the representative of the interests of U.S. imperialism and Japanese monopoly capital, and it is a replica of the Kishi Nobusuke cabinet. Miyamoto pointed out, however, that the current cabinet is trying to achieve the tasks assigned to it by Japanese monopoly capital in another way, that is, in a more cunning way. In fact, these methods are not new. The policies of whips and honey, suppression and deception have long been adopted by the ruling class.

The author also pointed out that there is another noteworthy situation in the Ikeda government's cunning policies, namely: while seeking to reconcile with the opposition parties—the Democratic Socialist Party and the Socialist Party—the Ikeda government is trying to weaken the united front of democratic forces, including the Communist Party and the Socialist Party.

Miyamoto Kenji pointed out that it is of particular significance that while the government authorities are adopting these tricks, U.S. imperialism is also exerting covert direct influence.

The author continued, "Our party believes that the establishment of joint struggle organizations (hundreds of thousands of people have participated in these organizations in the past year and a half, and the number of organizations has exceeded two thousand nationwide) is not for a short-term movement, but as a united front of the people. Its political task is to fight against the Japan-U.S. 'Security Treaty'. Our party's position is to strive for broad democratic forces, led by the working class, to take joint action against the Japan-U.S. military alliance, and to urge them to make common demands to the common enemy, so as to strengthen the unity of the democratic forces in the common struggle."

    宫本显治谈日本人民当前斗争任务
    团结民主力量继续反对日美条约
    指出池田政府仍是美帝国主义和日本垄断集团利益的代表
    新华社15日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科14日讯：日本共产党总书记宫本显治在苏联
  “真理报”上发表文章说：现在我们重要的任务是，要同一切民主力量一道在国会选举中对新日美“安全条约”给予致命的打击。现在党的所有力量都用来完成这个任务。
    他在文章中介绍了反对日美军事同盟的现阶段斗争。作者提到，自从日本和美国的统治集团“批准”新“安全条约”后，迄今已有两个月了。在这个时期内，它们努力于利用一切可能的手段医治它们在同人民的斗争中所受到的创伤和造成有利于自己的局面。
    宫本着重指出，接替岸信介政府的池田政府还是美帝国主义和日本垄断资本利益的代表，它是岸信介内阁的翻版。宫本指出，不过，目前的内阁力图用另一种方法、即更加狡猾的方法来实现日本垄断资本授予它的任务。其实，这些方法不是新的。鞭打和蜜果、镇压和欺骗的政策从老早就被统治阶级采用了。
    作者还指出，在池田政府的狡猾的政策中还有一个情况值得注意，这就是：池田政府一方面谋求同反对党——民主社会党和社会党调和，另一方面力图削弱包括共产党和社会党在内的民主力量的统一战线。
    宫本显治指出，具有特别意义的是：在政府当局采取这些手腕的同时，美国帝国主义也在给予隐蔽的直接影响。
    作者继续说，我们党认为，共同斗争组织（这些组织在最近一年半内已有数百万人参加，组织的数量在全国已有二千多个）的建立，不是为了短暂的运动，而是作为人民的统一战线而建立的。它的政治任务是进行反对日美“安全条约”的斗争。我们党的立场是：力争以工人阶级为首的广泛的民主力量，采取共同行动来反对日美军事同盟，并促使它们向共同敌人提出共同要求，以便在共同斗争中加强民主力量的团结一致。
