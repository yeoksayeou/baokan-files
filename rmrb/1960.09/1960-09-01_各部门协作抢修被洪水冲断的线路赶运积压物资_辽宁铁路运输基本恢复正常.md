Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 31st. The Shenyang-Anshan, Shenyang-Dalian, and Shenyang-Jilin trunk railway lines, and the Liaoyang-Benxi line in Liaoning Province, which were once interrupted by floods, have basically returned to normal transportation order after being repaired and opened to traffic.

After these major railway lines in Liaoning Province suffered flood damage in early August, a large number of goods transported from other places were once backlogged at various stations, and the freight yards of eight stations were blocked. Now, the freight trains backlogged at various stations have been dispersed, train operation is gradually normalizing, and the station freight yard congestion has also been greatly eased. According to the statistics of the Shenyang Railway Bureau, compared with the first ten days of August, the recent ten days from the 16th to the 25th saw an increase of 80.6% in steel transportation, 31.1% in coal transportation, and 113.8% in ore transportation.

The Shenyang-Anshan trunk line was fully repaired and opened to traffic on the 16th, following the Shenyang-Jilin and Shenyang-Dalian trunk lines. Up to now, except for the Fengcheng-Shanghekou and Benxi-Tianshifu branch lines which are still under repair, all railways in the province that were broken by floods have been restored to traffic.

After the flood damage occurred, the Party Committee of the Shenyang Railway Bureau, on the one hand, organized flood control forces to rush to repair the lines, and on the other hand, launched a mass movement among all employees to overcome the difficulties after the disaster and strive to quickly restore normal transportation order. Many leading cadres of the Railway Bureau and leading cadres of various districts, stations, and sections rushed to the transportation site one after another, fought alongside the workers, and directed transportation work. Tens of thousands of railway workers in the Fushun area, after the lines were just repaired, launched a high-yield transportation campaign to rush to transport coal produced by the Fushun Coal Mine.

In the work of rushing to transport backlogged goods and clearing the freight yards of various stations, the local municipal and district committees of the Chinese Communist Party and fraternal units all dispatched a large number of transportation forces and manpower to help the railway departments in their work. In order to quickly reverse the backlog of materials, the CPC Shenyang Municipal Committee launched a "Rush Transport Assault Week" throughout the city. The municipal party secretary and district party secretaries all went to the front line to direct the rush transport assault. In the week from August 8th to 14th alone, more than 4,000 cars, rubber-wheeled carts, and battery cars were dispatched from all directions, rushing to transport more than 58,000 tons of backlogged materials, freeing up more than 600 freight spaces in the freight yards of four stations in Shenyang, alleviating the congestion.

In order to restore normal transportation, the staff of various railway departments raced against time and fought heroically day and night. The staff of the engineering department actively reinforced and maintained lines and bridges, so that the repaired lines and bridges quickly returned to normal condition, in order to ensure that trains run at normal speed; the staff of the electrical department tried every possible means to repair the damaged lines and restore communication signal equipment, requiring that signals not have a single error; the drivers of the locomotive department also adopted the method of diligent observation and frequent inspection during driving to ensure the safe and punctual operation of trains.

    各部门协作抢修被洪水冲断的线路赶运积压物资
    辽宁铁路运输基本恢复正常
    据新华社沈阳31日电　曾经被洪水袭击中断行车的辽宁省沈（阳）安（东）、沈（阳）大（连）、沈（阳）吉（林）三条铁路干线和辽（阳）溪（本溪）线，在修复通车后已经基本上恢复正常运输秩序。
    辽宁省这几条主要铁路线在8月初遭受水害以后，从外地运来的大批货物曾一度积压在各个车站，有八个车站货场被堵塞。现在，积压在各车站的货物列车已经疏散出去，列车运行逐渐正常，车站货场堵塞状况也已大为和缓。据沈阳铁路局统计，16日到25日的最近十天与8月上旬相比，钢铁运量增长80.6％，煤炭运量增长31.1％，矿石运量增长113.8％。
    沈安干线是继沈吉、沈大两条干线通车之后，在16日全线修复通车的。至此，除凤（城）上（河口）、溪（本溪）田（田师府）两条支线还在抢修以外，全省被洪水冲断的所有铁路已经全部恢复通车。
    水害发生以后，沈阳铁路局党委曾一面组织防洪力量，抢修线路，一面发动全体职工掀起战胜灾后困难、力争迅速恢复运输正常秩序的群众运动。铁路局许多领导干部和各地区、站、段等领导干部都纷纷赶到运输现场，跟工人一起奋战，指挥运输工作。抚顺地区上万名铁路职工，在线路刚刚修复后，就大搞运输高产运动，突击外运抚顺煤矿生产的煤炭。
    在抢运积压货物、疏通各车站货场的工作中，各地中共市委、区委和兄弟单位，都抽调大批运输力和人力帮助铁路部门进行工作。中共沈阳市委为迅速扭转物资积压局面，在全市掀起“抢运突击周”，市委书记、区委书记都亲临第一线指挥突击抢运。仅8月8日到14日一周内，就从四面八方出动了四千多辆汽车、胶皮车和电瓶车，抢运出积压物资五万八千多吨，使沈阳市四个车站货场腾空六百多个货位，缓和了堵塞现象。
    各铁路部门职工为恢复正常运输，分秒必争地日夜英勇奋战。工务部门的职工积极加固和维修线路、桥梁，使修复的线路、桥梁迅速恢复正常状态，以便保证列车按正常速度运行；电务部门职工千方百计修复受害线路，恢复通讯信号设备，要求信号不发生一次误差；机务部门的司机们在行车当中，也采取勤了望、勤检查的办法，保证列车安全正点运行。
