　　·My Heart Flies to Beijing·
    Lin Yun
Across thousands of rivers, across tens of thousands of mountains,
My heart, oh, my heart, wants to fly to Beijing,
To participate in the National Day celebrations,
To revel and rejoice with my compatriots.
Before dawn, my heart flew to Beijing,
It heard the powerful footsteps of the people,
Resounding in Beijing's streets and alleys,
Shaking the earth, the mountains, and the oceans.
A team of people in the morning light,
Like a tide, surged toward Tiananmen Square,
The morning glow adorns the festive Tiananmen,
Making it especially magnificent, majestic, and glorious.
Red palace lanterns, vermilion pillars,
Gleam under the gold-carved and jade-inlaid eaves,
The five-star red flag rises from the ground,
Like a soaring roc, flying high in the sky.
The rising sun shines on the ocean of people,
Chairman Mao and his close comrades-in-arms,
Accompanying the leaders of our great allies,
Slowly walk to Tiananmen.
Cheers and cannon salutes awaken the ancestors of all ages,
Emperor Taizong of Tang and Emperor Taizu of Song rush forward,
Crowding out of the doors of the history museum,
Together, they crane their necks on the marble steps to look up.
Countless leading figures of our time,
Stride out of the Great Hall of the People,
My poem wants to thank them for their hard work and contributions,
And sing aloud for their wisdom and achievements.
Distinguished guests from around the globe,
With warm friendship,
Form a mountain of spectators,
Standing beside the vast ocean of people.
The Monument to the People's Heroes is like a white lighthouse,
Towering high in the center of the sea of people,
The reliefs and golden characters on the marble,
Forever radiate immortal light.
A torrent of people,
Gathering the waves of the Yellow River and the Yangtze River,
Surges from East Chang'an Avenue to the west,
Inviting the Party and the government to inspect this growing strength.
Chairman Mao is radiant and smiles,
Raising his hand to answer the millions of eyes gazing at him,
The millions of bunches of flowers raised high to him.
Children—the flowers of the motherland,
Millions of small hands waving colorful bouquets,
A chime of silver bells vibrates before Tiananmen:
Long live the People's Republic!
Chairman Mao, good health!
In an instant, the sea of people roars with cheers,
Churning up a giant wave of flowers;
Millions of white doves flap their wings and fly together,
Circling over the red Tiananmen.
Eleven years of struggle, the Republic is as solid as a rock,
Standing tall in the East of the mainland;
Eleven years of hard work, the disaster-stricken motherland has become a happy homeland.
Thousands of miles away, I feel as if I am in Tiananmen Square,
My heart soars in the sea of people with the singing.
I raise my hands high above my head,
Rolled into the waves of the sea of people, rushing to the Jinshui Bridge.
I throw the bouquet vigorously onto Tiananmen,
Shouting loudly, with all the strength of my life:
Dear motherland, I wish you prosperity and flourishing!
Wise leader, I wish you boundless longevity!
Before National Day, 1960, in Alma-Ata, USSR

　　·我的心飞向北京·
    林耘越过千条水，越过万重山，我的心儿呀，要飞往北京，去参加国庆节的盛典，去和同胞们共乐狂欢。黎明前我的心就飞到了北京，它听见了人民雄健的脚步声，震响在北京的大街小巷，震撼着大地、山河、海洋。一队队人流在晨曦中，潮水般涌向天安门广场，朝霞装饰着节日的天安门，使它格外瑰丽、雄伟、辉煌。红色的宫灯，朱漆的圆柱，在金雕玉琢的廊檐下闪闪发光，五星红旗从平地升起，像展翅的鹏鸟在空中高高飞翔。朝阳升起在人群的大海上，毛主席和他的亲密战友，陪同着伟大盟邦的领袖，徐步来到天安门上。欢呼声、礼炮声惊醒了历代祖先，唐宗宋祖都争前恐后，拥出历史博物馆的大门，齐来大理石的台阶上仰首观望。无数当代风流人物，大踏步迈出了人民大会堂，我的诗要感谢他们的辛劳和贡献，为他们的智慧和成就而高昂地歌唱。来自环球的远方贵宾，怀着热情的友谊，组成了观礼的人山，耸立在浩瀚的人海之旁。人民英雄纪念碑像座白色灯塔，高高地耸立在人海中央，大理石上的浮雕、金字，永远放射着不朽的光芒。一条群众的巨流，汇集了黄河与长江的波浪，由东长安街向西涌进，请党和政府来检阅这日增夜长的力量。毛主席容光焕发，微笑着举手回答那千万双向他注视的目光，那千万束向他高举的鲜花。少年儿童——祖国的花朵，千万只小手挥舞着鲜艳的花束，一片银铃声在天安门前振荡：人民共和国万岁！毛主席健康！霎那间，人海上欢声雷动，翻腾着鲜花的巨浪；千万只白鸽振翅齐飞，盘旋在红色的天安门上。十一年奋斗，共和国坚如磐石，屹立在大陆的东方；十一年苦干，多灾受难的祖国变成了幸福的家乡。万里之外，我如同置身在天安门广场，我的心随着歌声在人海上翱翔。我把双手高举在头顶，卷在人海的浪花中，涌到金水桥旁。我把花束，使劲掷上天安门，放声高呼，用尽生平的力量：亲爱的祖国，祝你繁荣、兴旺！英明的领袖，祝你万寿无疆！1960年国庆节前于苏联阿拉木图市
