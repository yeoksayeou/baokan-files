Xinhua News Agency, Rangoon, September 22nd. Burmese Prime Minister U Nu delivered a speech in the Chamber of Representatives today on recent developments in international affairs.

He said that the wave of struggle for freedom and independence that swept Asia after the Second World War had also spread to the African continent. He extended a warm welcome to all the newly independent countries of Africa. He said, "We will, of course, vote in favor of their entry into the United Nations. We look forward to establishing good friendly relations with each of these newly liberated countries, as well as those that are about to be liberated and those that are considering ways to achieve liberation."

Speaking about the current situation in the Congo, U Nu said, "We recognize and continue to recognize the Congo as a single country. However, this does not mean that we advocate any particular constitutional structure for the Congolese state. In our view, that is an internal affair that should be resolved by the Congolese people themselves, and external parties, including the United Nations, should not interfere."

U Nu said, "The complete withdrawal of Belgian troops is a necessary condition for resolving the Congo issue."

Regarding the Algerian national liberation movement, Prime Minister U Nu said that a solution based on the "principle of self-determination" should be applied.

Regarding the recent developments in the Kingdom of Laos, U Nu said, "Only the Lao people themselves, in accordance with the 1954 Geneva Accords on the Laotian issue, can formulate a lasting solution to this problem, and we call on all relevant countries to help promote such a solution."

Prime Minister U Nu said that he hoped disarmament negotiations would continue. He said that, in consultation with the leaders of countries holding similar views, he had been considering participating in the discussion on disarmament at this session of the United Nations General Assembly.

Referring to the Sino-Indian border issue, Prime Minister U Nu said, "We sincerely hope that these two neighbors will be able to peacefully resolve their current differences in the near future."

In referring to the issue of foreign aid, Prime Minister U Nu reiterated that the Burmese government would continue to accept aid from any source, provided that such aid was not subject to political conditions.

    吴努总理就国际局势发表演说
　　联合国没有权利干涉刚果内政
　　老挝问题应按日内瓦协议解决
    新华社仰光22日电　缅甸总理吴努今天在代表院就最近的国际事态发展发表了演说。
    他说，第二次世界大战结束后席卷亚洲的争取自由和独立的浪潮也波及非洲大陆。他对所有非洲新独立的国家表示热烈欢迎。他说，“我们当然将投票赞成它们进入联合国。我们期望同这些刚解放的国家和即将获得解放以及正在考虑实现解放的途径的国家一一建立良好的友好关系。”
    吴努在谈到目前的刚果局势时说，“我们承认而且继续承认刚果是一个单一的国家。但是，这并不是说，我们主张刚果国家采取任何特定的宪法结构。在我们看来，那是应由刚果人民自己来解决的内政问题，外界包括联合国不得加以干涉。”
    吴努说，“比利时军队完全撤退是解决刚果问题的必要条件。”
    谈到阿尔及利亚民族解放运动时，吴努总理说，应当应用以“自决原则”为基础的解决办法。
    关于最近老挝王国的事态发展，吴努说，“只有老挝人民自己根据1954年关于老挝问题的日内瓦协议才能制订出解决这个问题的持久的办法，我们呼吁一切有关国家帮助促进这种解决”。
    吴努总理说，他希望裁军谈判继续进行。他说，在同抱有相同见解的国家的领导人磋商下，他一直在考虑参加联合国大会本届会议关于裁军问题的讨论。
    谈到中印边界问题时，吴努总理说，“我们热诚地希望，这两个邻国将有可能在最近的将来和平地解决它们目前的分歧”。
    吴努在谈到外国援助问题时重申，缅甸政府将继续接受不论来自任何方面的援助，只要这种援助不附带政治条件。
