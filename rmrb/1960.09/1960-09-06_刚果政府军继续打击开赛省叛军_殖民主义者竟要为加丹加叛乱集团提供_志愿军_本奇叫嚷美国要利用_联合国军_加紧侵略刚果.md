Xinhua News Agency, 5th September - Bakwanga Dispatch: Congolese government troops who captured Bakwanga, the nest of the secessionist group of Kalonji in Kasai province, recaptured the village of Tshelenge, seventeen miles southeast of Bakwanga, on the 4th, after a fierce battle.

It is reported that the reactionary troops of the Kalonji secessionist group, supported by imperialism, attempted to defend themselves by relying on a river as a natural barrier, but they were routed by the government troops. Sources say that this reactionary army is fleeing towards Katanga.

A spokesman for the secessionist group of Tshombe in Katanga province confirmed on the 4th that there were many colonialists in the reactionary army of Kalonji. He also revealed that the Katanga rebels had received suggestions from at least twenty foreign countries to provide "volunteer troops," including France, West Germany, the Netherlands, as well as South Africa and the British colony of Rhodesia.

Reports say that Congolese government troops marching south from Goma in the northeastern part of Kivu province to fight the Tshombe secessionist group in Katanga province are rapidly advancing towards Katanga.

Xinhua News Agency, 2nd September - New York Dispatch: Bunche, the UN Under-Secretary-General, an American who was driven back home by the Congolese people, clamored on the 1st that the United States should intensify its aggression against the Congo by using the United Nations.

At a press conference held a few hours after returning to New York from Leopoldville, Bunche advocated expanding the U.S. tool of intrusion into the Congo, namely the United Nations forces sent to the Congo. He clamored that the "UN forces" in the Congo are now "not big enough," and that this force should be increased from the current 16,000 to at least 18,000. Bunche expressed uneasiness about the increasingly exposed face of the UN in the Congo and the Congolese military and civilians launching struggles against the interference of the "UN forces." He even threatened the Congolese people with "the use of force." He said menacingly: "It has not been easy for the UN forces" not to open fire on the Congolese people. Situations may arise where it will be necessary to open fire."

Bunche expressed appreciation for the secessionist activities of Tshombe, the governor of Katanga province in the Congo, which were condoned by the United Nations and supported by imperialism. He described some of the dissatisfaction expressed by the Congolese central government with the UN's failure to help the Congo achieve unification as so-called "misunderstandings" and "excessive and hasty expectations" of the UN. He also openly attempted to use the UN again to interfere in the Congo's internal affairs, saying that if the Congolese central government marched into Katanga province and clashed with the Tshombe traitorous group, the matter would be submitted to the United Nations Security Council.

    刚果政府军继续打击开赛省叛军
    殖民主义者竟要为加丹加叛乱集团提供“志愿军”
    本奇叫嚷美国要利用“联合国军”加紧侵略刚果
    新华社5日讯　巴克旺加消息：攻克开赛省卡隆吉分裂集团巢穴巴克旺加的刚果政府军，在经过一场激战以后，4日又收复了巴克旺加东南十七英里的切朗吉村。
    据报道，受到帝国主义支持的卡隆吉分裂集团的反动军队，曾经企图凭借一条河流为天险进行顽抗，但是，在政府军的攻击下，已狼狈逃窜。有消息说，这支反动军队正向加丹加方向溃逃中。
    据加丹加省冲伯分裂集团的一位发言人4日证实，在卡隆吉的反动军队中，有许多殖民主义者。他还透露，加丹加叛军收到了至少二十个外国提供“志愿军”的建议，其中包括法国、西德、荷兰、还有南非和英国的殖民地罗得西亚。
    消息说，从基伍省东北部果马南下讨伐加丹加省冲伯分裂集团的刚果政府军正迅速向加丹加挺进中。
    新华社2日讯　纽约消息：被刚果人民赶回老家的联合国副秘书长、美国人本奇1日叫嚷美国要加紧利用联合国来侵略刚果。
    本奇在从利奥波德维尔返回纽约后几小时举行的一次记者招待会上主张扩大美国侵入刚果的工具，即派往刚果的联合国部队。他叫嚷说，在刚果的“联合国军”现在“还不够大”，这支军队应当从目前的一万六千人增加到最少一万八千人。本奇对联合国在刚果的面目日益暴露和刚果军民纷纷展开反对
  “联合国军”的干涉的斗争表示不安，他居然以“使用武力”相威胁，来恫吓刚果人民。他杀气腾腾地说：“联合国军”对刚果人民“决定不开枪并不是容易的。可能发生将必须开枪的情况”。
    本奇对于在联合国纵容和帝国主义支持下，刚果的加丹加省省长冲伯的分裂活动表示赞赏。他把刚果中央政府对联合国没有帮助刚果实现统一所表示的某些不满，说成是对联合国的所谓“误解”和“期望过多过急”。他还公然企图再次用联合国来干涉刚果内政说，如果刚果中央政府进军加丹加省同冲伯卖国集团发生了冲突，这个问题就要提交给联合国安全理事会。
