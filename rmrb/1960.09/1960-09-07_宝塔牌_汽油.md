"Pagoda Brand" Gasoline
Xiao Bai

In the Anti-Japanese War Hall of the Military Museum of the Chinese People's Revolution, there are two ordinary glass bottles on display: one containing gasoline, and the other containing crude oil. These were refined by the Eighth Route Army using indigenous methods during the arduous years of the Anti-Japanese War.

A team of Eighth Route Army soldiers came from Yan'an to Yanchang County, not far from Yan'an. Here, they started a weapons factory from scratch. The soldiers discovered a layer of brownish oil floating on the surface of a small river ditch. Some local people would scoop it up and refine it for use as lamp oil. The soldiers thought: could we collect the oil and refine gasoline ourselves? Then the factory's motor could run again. But no one was sure, because none of them knew how gasoline was refined. So, they sent a cultural instructor to the Yan'an Library to borrow a book. But the book only talked about common sense and principles. The soldiers said: I'm afraid the gentleman who wrote the book has never refined gasoline himself, otherwise why wouldn't there be specific methods? In the end, they abandoned the book and everyone started working together, starting with finding "oil eyes"! In a few days, the "oil eyes" were found, and the soldiers excitedly filled several earthenware pots and carried them back. But how to turn this turbid crude oil into clear gasoline? All they had were two empty hands, and the two major difficulties of materials and technology stood before these heroes. Faced with difficulties, the soldiers were all like fierce tigers and brave generals. In the absence of necessary raw materials such as steel and glass, they used wood, mud, earthenware pots, and bottles to put together a set of equipment. After many twists and turns and failures, they finally produced gasoline. They poured the self-made gasoline into the motor, and instantly, the motor started to whir, alarming the mountain village and county town. People came to see the Eighth Route Army refining gasoline.

The next morning, a donkey carried two barrels of self-made gasoline from Yanchang, heading to Yan'an to report the production achievements to the Central Committee. When the logistics section comrades at Zao Yuan saw the two barrels of gasoline, they asked in surprise:

"Where did you get this 'Asiatic Petroleum' gasoline?"

The soldier excitedly said: "This is an 'Asiatic Petroleum' gasoline barrel, but inside is our self-made gasoline!"

"Great! Our border region has a 'gasoline company' now. What brand is your gasoline?" The logistics section comrade said jokingly to the soldier who delivered the oil.

"We don't have a brand yet, but if we want to, we could call it… call it Yan'an 'Pagoda Brand'!" (Attached picture)

    “宝塔牌”汽油
    晓白
    在中国人民革命军事博物馆抗日战争馆里，陈列着两个普通的玻璃瓶：一瓶内装着汽油，一瓶装的原油。这是抗日战争艰苦岁月里八路军用土法炼出来的。
    有一队八路军战士从延安来到了离延安不远的延长县，他们在这里白手起家办起了兵工厂。战士们在一条小河沟里，发现水上经常浮着一层褐色的油花，当地人民有的把它捞起来，炼一炼当灯油用。战士们心想：能不能把油集起来，自己动手炼汽油呢？那兵工厂的马达就又可以转起来了。但大家心里都没有数，因为汽油怎么炼出来的，他们谁都不知道。于是派文化教员到延安图书馆借了一本书来，可是书上只谈了谈常识和道理，战士们说：恐怕写书的这个先生也没炼过汽油，要不怎么没具体办法呢？最后还是抛开书，大家都动起手来，首先从找“油眼”开始了第一步！不几天，“油眼”找到了，战士们兴奋地装了满满的好几瓦罐提了回来。但怎么才能把这浑浊的原油变成透亮的汽油呢？眼前就是两只空手，物质和技术两大难关摆在英雄们面前。战士们在困难面前个个都如猛虎闯将，他们在没有钢铁、玻璃等必须原料的情况下，用木、泥、瓦罐、瓶子凑成一套设备，经过了许多曲折和失败，最后终于制成了汽油。他们把自制的汽油注到了马达里去，刹时，马达嘟嘟地转动起来了，惊动了山村和县镇，人们都来参观八路军炼汽油。
    第二天早上，毛驴驮着两桶自制汽油，从延长出发，上延安给中央报告生产成绩。当枣园的总务科同志看到这两桶汽油时，惊奇地问：
    “你们从那里弄来的‘亚细亚’汽油？”
    战士兴奋地说：“这是‘亚细亚’汽油桶，可是桶里装的是我们自制的汽油！”
    “好啊！我们边区有了‘汽油公司’了，你们的汽油是什么牌子的？”总务科的同志高兴地向送油的战士说笑话。
    “牌子还没有，不过要起也可以，比如叫……叫延安‘宝塔牌’吧！”（附图片）
