Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, 8th. According to a report by the German News Agency: The people of the German Democratic Republic felt deep grief upon learning of the death of their president. The name of Wilhelm Pieck, the president of the first German worker-peasant state, will forever be linked to the decades of struggle of the German working class and to the result of this struggle, the establishment of the German Democratic Republic.

At 11:30 Central European Time, all radio and television stations in the German Democratic Republic broadcast the unfortunate news, followed by a minute of silence. Throughout the German Democratic Republic, in the shipyards of the Baltic Sea, in the coal pits of the Zwickau mining area, in villages and towns, people mourned this news. Flags were flown at half-mast everywhere.

Workers, engineers, and technicians at the largest heavy machinery factory in the German Democratic Republic, the Ernst Thälmann Factory in Magdeburg, after observing a minute of silence, decorated Wilhelm Pieck's portrait with black crepe.

The youth of the German Democratic Republic are also mourning the passing of their great friend, their role model, and their sincerely beloved president. In schools, classes have been interrupted, and teachers are speaking about Wilhelm Pieck's life and the struggles he waged.

Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, 8th. The Central Committee of the German Communist Party, through the German Freedom Radio Station Nine-O-Four, published an obituary regarding the death of Comrade Wilhelm Pieck.

The obituary stated that the Central Committee of the German Communist Party, the workers of West Germany, and peace-loving people learned with deep sorrow of the death of our dear comrade and friend, Wilhelm Pieck.

With his passing, the entire German working class and nation lost an outstanding fighter against militarism and imperialist war, and for peace, progress, and happiness. As a comrade-in-arms of Liebknecht, Luxemburg, and Thälmann, his life and work are an example of struggle for the working class and all the excellent forces among our people against our mortal enemies, the imperialists.

The obituary narrated Comrade Pieck's history of struggle and achievements. The obituary stated that Wilhelm Pieck, together with Liebknecht, Luxemburg, Franz Mehring, and Zetkin, was a founder of the German Communist Party. Shoulder to shoulder with Thälmann, Pieck became one of the most important leaders of the German working class and laboring masses.

The obituary said that as proletarian internationalists, firmly loyal to our class and our people, we must fight in the spirit of our great deceased. Like him, we must strive for the united action of the working class and all peace-loving forces against German imperialism and militarism, and for the fraternal cooperation of workers' organizations throughout Germany.

The obituary concluded, "Dear Comrade Wilhelm Pieck, this is our oath. If we realize your legacy and achieve the victory of peace and democracy in the western part of our country, on the day our cause triumphs throughout Germany, you will be with us."

    德共中央发表讣告决心实现皮克遗志
    新华社柏林8日电　据德意志通讯社报道：德意志民主共和国人民在获悉他们的总统逝世的消息后感到深切的悲痛。第一个德国工农国家的总统威廉·皮克的名字，将永远同德国工人阶级的数十年的斗争以及同这一斗争的结果即德意志民主共和国的建立联系在一起。
    在中欧时间十一点三十分，德意志民主共和国所有的电台和电视台广播了这一不幸的消息，然后进行了一分钟的默哀。整个德意志民主共和国，在波罗的海的船坞里，在扎卡乌矿区的煤坑里，在乡村和城镇，人民都为这个消息而感到悲痛。到处都下半旗志哀。
    德意志民主共和国最大的重型机械制造厂——马格德堡的恩斯特·台尔曼工厂的工人们、工程师们和技术人员们，在作了一分钟的默哀之后，用黑绉纱把威廉·皮克的遗像装饰了起来。
    德意志民主共和国的青年们也在哀悼他们的伟大的朋友、他们的榜样和他们真诚热爱的总统的逝世。在学校中，课程已经间断，教师们在讲威廉·皮克的一生和他所进行的斗争。

    讣告说，德共中央委员会、西德的工人们和爱好和平的人民，怀着深深的哀痛得悉我们亲爱的同志和朋友威廉·皮克的逝世。
    由于他的逝世，整个德国工人阶级和民族失去了反对军国主义和帝国主义战争、争取和平、进步和幸福的一个卓越战士。作为李卜克内西、卢森堡和台尔曼的战友，他的一生和工作是工人阶级和我们人民中一切反对我们的帝国主义死敌的优秀力量的斗争榜样。
    讣告叙述了皮克同志的斗争历史和功绩。讣告说，威廉·皮克同李卜克内西、卢森堡、弗朗茨·梅林和蔡特金一起，是德国共产党的创始人，同台尔曼肩并肩，皮克成为德国工人阶级和劳动群众的最重要的领袖之一。

    讣告最后说，亲爱的威廉·皮克同志，这是我们的誓言。如果我们实现了你的遗志，在我们祖国的西部也取得和平和民主的胜利的那一天，在我们的事业在整个德国胜利的那一天，你将是同我们在一起的。（附图片）
