　　Actively Purchase New Cotton
    New cotton has been put on the market in large quantities. Commercial departments in various regions, under the unified leadership of the Party committees, should take immediate action and launch a high tide of new cotton purchase so as to supply the textile departments with cotton in a timely manner for the production of cotton textiles, to meet the needs of all sectors of the national economy and the broad masses of urban and rural people.
    Party committees at all levels attach even greater importance to the purchase of cotton and other agricultural and sideline products this year than ever before. Encouraged by the movement of the whole Party and the entire people to vigorously develop agriculture and grain production, the people's communes in cotton-producing areas, in order to strive for a greater leap forward in cotton production next year, are currently eager to sell cotton in exchange for various means of production necessary for expanded reproduction. These are all favorable conditions for purchasing cotton. As long as we adhere to putting politics in command, exert full effort, rely on the masses, and conscientiously summarize and promote the past effective experience in purchase work, it is entirely possible to victoriously complete and even overfulfill the cotton purchase plan.
    During the peak season, the amount of cotton on the market is very large and highly concentrated. It is an extremely tense and arduous task to pick and purchase a large amount of cotton in a short period of time, and to process it in a timely manner. It would be impossible to do a good job by relying solely on a small number of people in the commercial departments for the purchase. To do a good job, we must resolutely rely on the masses, follow the mass line, and launch a large-scale mass movement. Since the Great Leap Forward in 1958, a very important experience in completing the cotton purchase task quickly and well has been the large-scale mass movement in the purchase work. What is the key to launching a large-scale mass movement for purchase work? It is to strengthen the leadership of the Party and do a good job of ideological and political work. In strengthening the leadership of cotton purchase, the most important thing for Party committees at all levels is to penetrate ideological and political work into all links, all stages, and all aspects of the purchase work. It is necessary to vigorously publicize the Party's general line for socialist construction to the broad masses, talk about the excellent situation of the rapid development of national construction, talk about the superiority of the people's communes, and talk about the state's policies for purchasing agricultural products. In particular, since the beginning of this year, in the national movement to support agriculture, all walks of life have given great support to cotton production in terms of manpower, material resources, and technology, and many vivid and moving examples have emerged. We must be good at using these materials to raise the awareness of the broad masses. In this way, we will be able to quickly launch a mass upsurge in cotton purchase and greatly accelerate the progress of the purchase work.
    On the basis of launching a large-scale mass movement, paying attention to improving the purchase methods is also a very important issue. After the realization of the rural people's commune system in our country, the productive forces have been greatly liberated. From the perspective of production methods, the degree of collectivization of production has been unprecedentedly improved, and the production management, harvesting, processing, and delivery of various major agricultural products are increasingly concentrated. In this case, we should implement the method of centralized picking, centralized delivery, and centralized processing throughout the country, taking the basic accounting unit of the people's commune as the unit. This method was promoted in many regions last year. Experience has proved that adopting this method is more adaptable to the new situation than the decentralized picking, decentralized processing, and decentralized delivery methods. It can achieve fast picking, fast processing, and fast purchase. This is not only conducive to completing the purchase task quickly and well, but also can avoid the loss of cotton and increase the amount of cotton harvested.
    The next few months are the busy season for harvesting and planting, and large-scale accumulation and production of fertilizer must also be carried out at the same time. All regions should make overall arrangements for labor. In order to ensure the smooth implementation of the "three centralizations" method of cotton collection, we should organize cotton picking teams to implement centralized picking. When the cotton is sprayed on a large scale, we should also organize various forces to form temporary shock cotton picking teams as much as possible. After picking, it should be dried and transported locally for delivery, picking, drying, and transporting simultaneously. At the end of the cotton picking period and after the cotton stalks are pulled out, we must also adhere to centralized picking and centralized stripping, so that no cotton boll is left behind and every piece of fiber belongs to the public.
    In this year's new cotton purchase, commercial departments must do a good job of acceptance. The acceptance link includes several contents such as grade verification, weighing, settlement, and warehousing. This link is the stage where commercial departments are in direct contact with the broad masses of commune members, and it is an important link in which commercial departments embody the Party's purchase policy and embody the relationship between the state and the collective, and must be done with all our strength. In the cotton grade verification, we should follow the mass line and absorb representatives of the masses to participate in supervision, so as to correctly implement the policy of "better cotton for better price, and inferior cotton for inferior price." In order to facilitate the sale of cotton to the broad masses, when the cotton is concentrated on the market during the peak season, we should appropriately increase the number of flower collection points or take auxiliary methods such as sending people to the team for acceptance to save their delivery time. Commercial departments must also cooperate with relevant departments to strengthen short-distance transportation work in order to transport cotton out in a timely manner to meet the needs of the textile departments.

### 积极收购新棉

　　积极收购新棉
    新棉已经大量上市，各地商业部门要在党委统一领导下，立即行动起来，掀起一个新棉收购高潮，以便把棉花及时供应纺织部门生产棉织品，以适应国民经济各部门和广大城乡人民的需要。
    各级党委对今年棉花和其它农副产品收购工作，也比过去任何时候都更为重视；在全党全民大办农业、大办粮食运动的鼓舞下，产棉区人民公社为了争取明年棉花生产的更大跃进，当前迫切要求出售棉花，以换回扩大再生产所必需的各种生产资料。这些都是收购棉花的有利条件，只要我们坚持政治挂帅，鼓足干劲，依靠群众，认真总结和推广过去行之有效的收购工作经验，胜利地完成以至超额完成棉花收购计划，是完全可以做到的。
    在收购旺季，棉花上市数量很大，而且十分集中，要在短时间内把数量很多的棉花采摘、收购起来，并且及时进行加工，是一件极为紧张而繁重的工作，光靠商业部门少数人去收购，一定是办不好的。要想办好就必须坚决依靠群众，走群众路线，大搞群众运动。1958年大跃进以来，棉花收购任务所以完成得既快又好，极为重要的一条经验就是因为在收购工作上也大搞群众运动。大搞收购工作群众运动的关键是什么？加强党的领导，做好思想政治工作。各级党委在加强棉花收购的领导中，最要紧的是要把思想政治工作深入到收购工作的各个环节，各个阶段，各个方面。要大张旗鼓地向广大群众宣传党的社会主义建设总路线，大讲国家建设事业高速发展的大好形势，大讲人民公社优越性，大讲国家农产品收购政策；特别是今年以来，在支援农业的全民运动中，各行各业从人力、物力、技术方面给了棉花生产以很大的支援，出现了许多生动感人的事例，我们要善于运用这些材料，提高广大群众的认识。这样，我们就能够很快地掀起一个群众性的收购棉花的高潮，大大加快收购工作的进度。
    在大搞群众运动的基础上，注意改进收购方法，也是一个十分重要的问题。农村人民公社化在我国实现以后，大大解放了生产力。从生产方式来看，生产集体化的程度空前地提高了，各种主要农产品的生产管理、收获、加工、交售都日益趋向于集中进行。在这种情况下，应当在全国实行以人民公社基本核算单位为单位，集中采摘、集中交售、集中加工的方法。这种方法去年在不少地区推行过，经验证明，采用这种方法要比分散采摘、分散加工、分散交售的方法更能适应新的形势，可以做到采摘得快、加工得快、收购得快，这不仅便于又快又好地完成收购任务，而且还可以避免棉花流散损失，提高棉花的收获量。
    今后几个月正是收获、耕种的繁忙季节，大规模的积肥造肥也要同时进行。各地要把劳动力统筹安排好。为了保证顺利地推行“三集中”的收棉方法，应当组织摘棉队，实行集中采摘。棉花大喷的时候还要尽可能地组织各种力量成立临时突击摘棉队伍。采摘下来以后要就地晾晒、就地运交，边摘、边晒、边运。棉花采摘末期和棉秸拔下来以后，也要坚持集中拾、集中剥，做到一桃不留，朵絮归公。
    在今年的新棉收购中，商业部门必须做好验收工作。验收这个环节包括验级、过磅、结算、入库等几个内容。这个环节是商业部门与广大社员群众直接接触的阶段，是商业部门体现党的收购政策、体现国家与集体关系的一个重要环节，必须全力做好。在棉花验级上应该走群众路线，吸收群众代表参加监督，以便正确地贯彻“优棉优价，次棉次价”的政策；为了便利广大群众售棉，在旺季棉花上市集中的时候，要适当增设收花点或采取派人到队验收等辅助方法，节省他们交售的时间。商业部门还必须协同有关部门加强短途运输工作，以便及时地把棉花调运出来，供应纺织部门需要。
