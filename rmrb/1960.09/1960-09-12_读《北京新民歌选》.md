Reading "Selection of New Folk Songs of Beijing" 	Liu Lanshan

Like the selections of excellent new folk songs published by various provinces and cities across the country, "Selection of New Folk Songs of Beijing" is also a delightful book. These new folk song collections, with their unique heroic and robust images and uplifting and joyful sounds, stir people's heartstrings, and are poetic, picturesque, and beautifully illustrated, pleasing to both the eye and the mind.

Opening "Selection of New Folk Songs of Beijing," from the first collection to the ninth, it seems as if a powerful red thread runs through these one hundred and forty new folk songs: the Party's General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Commune. This red thread is so strongly attracting and exciting you, making you relive those unforgettable days of the Ming Tombs Reservoir construction site, the day and night of the Great Smelting of Steel, the workshops with the symphony of roaring machines and the sounds of poetry, and the suburban rural communes with their gongs and drums and red flags covering the sky... The new folk songs of Beijing can be said to be the footsteps of the Great Leap Forward; they emerged from the people's hot and enthusiastic labor and encouraged and organized people to carry out even better labor. Therefore, they have extremely vigorous vitality.

Let's take a few examples: the first four lines of "Holding High the Red Flag" sing: "Beat the sky-shaking drum, strike the earth-shaking gong, high mountains dance the yangko, the sea smiles cheerfully." Striking the drums of heaven and earth, what a magnificent momentum; and the imagination of mountains dancing and the sea smiling is so bold and rich! Construction workers not only built countless towering socialist buildings but also built palaces of art, and "Peace Building" is such a work. The last four lines of this poem read: "The sun comes to be a traffic policeman, the satellite comes to be a passenger ship, whoever goes to the moon for a trip, is welcome to come here for a snack." The scene is ever-changing, and the meaning is full of interest, giving the reader the feeling of being in the celestial bodies. When the reservoir workers pushed the wheelbarrows, listen: "Pushing the wheelbarrow and singing, pushing a cart and singing a basketful. The carts are full of happiness fruits, the baskets are full of Great Leap Forward songs." ("Pushing the Wheelbarrow and Singing") In this poem, the wheelbarrow workers not only praised their labor and sang the praises of the wheelbarrow, but also vividly depicted the close relationship between the new folk songs and the enthusiasm for labor.

Beijing is a place with extremely rich folk song traditions. After the working people themselves eliminated the dross and promoted the new, absorbed the nourishment of the old folk songs, and enriched the creation of new folk songs. The new folk song "Ten Thousand Rivers Flow to the Sea" begins with six consecutive "one" characters, from "One tree cannot make a forest" to "One drop of dew easily dries up," repeatedly making analogies, and only in the last two sentences does it reveal the theme, which is "Ten thousand rivers flow to the sea, the power of the commune can move mountains." Another example is "A Pair of Hands Busily Working," starting with "Rows of machine tools are roaring," and the following nine sentences all begin with the character "one," and the last two sentences are "Hearts are singing, voices are praising the Communist Party." How ingenious and powerful! This form is not commonly seen in other new folk song collections. I think they are absorbed and transformed from old Beijing folk songs and folk literature, and singing them has a special meaning.

    读《北京新民歌选》	刘岚山
    和全国各省市出版的优秀新民歌选一样，《北京新民歌选》也是一本令人喜爱的书。这些新民歌选集都以它们特有的雄壮健美的形象和昂扬欢乐的声音激动着人们的心弦，而且，诗情画意，相得益彰，图文并茂，赏心悦目。
    打开《北京新民歌选》，从第一辑到第九辑，仿佛有一根强大的红线贯穿在这一百四十首新民歌中，这便是党的总路线、大跃进和人民公社。这根红线是那样强烈地在吸引着、激动着你，使你又一次去重温那难忘的十三陵水库工地、大炼钢铁的日日夜夜、机器轰鸣和诗声朗朗交响的车间、锣鼓喧天和红旗蔽日的郊区农村公社化的日子……北京新民歌可以说是大跃进的脚步声；它们从人们热火朝天的劳动中产生出来，又鼓舞组织人们去进行更好的劳动。因而，它们有极其旺盛的生命力。
    让我们举几个例子来看看吧：《高举大红旗》的前四句这样唱道：“打起惊天鼓，敲起震地锣，高山扭秧歌，大海笑呵呵。”敲打天鼓地锣，这气势是何等雄壮；而山舞海笑的想像又是多么大胆而丰美！建筑工人们不仅盖起了无数高可触天的社会主义大楼，也盖起了艺术的宫殿，《和平楼》便是一首这样的作品。这首诗的后四句这样写道：“太阳来当交通警，卫星来做客运船，谁往月宫去旅行，欢迎到此来打尖。”气象万千，意趣横溢，使得读者也有置身天体之间的感觉。当水库工人在推起双轮车的时候，你听吧：“推起双轮唱起歌，推一车来唱一箩。车车装的幸福果，箩箩都是跃进歌。”（《推起双轮唱起歌》）在这首诗歌中，推土工人既赞美了自己的劳动、歌颂了车子化，也形象地描绘出新民歌和劳动干劲的密切关系。
    北京是个民歌传统极其丰富的地方，经过劳动人民自己去芜存菁、推陈出新之后，吸收了旧民歌的营养，丰富了新民歌的创作。《万条河川归大海》这首新民歌一连用六个“一”字起头，从“一棵树木不成林”到“一滴露水容易干”，反复比喻，最后两句才道出主题，这便是“万条河川归大海，公社力量搬倒山”。又如《一双双手儿忙又忙》这首，从“一台台机床隆隆响”起句，以后九句都用“一”字起头，最后两句是“一颗颗心儿把歌唱，一声声歌颂共产党”。多么巧妙和有力！这种形式在别的新民歌集子中还不多见，我以为它们是从北京旧民歌、民间文学中吸取、变化而来的，说唱起来，别有一种意味。
