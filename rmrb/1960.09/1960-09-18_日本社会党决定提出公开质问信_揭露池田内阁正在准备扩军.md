Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, September 17th: The Central Executive Committee of the Japan Socialist Party held a meeting on the 16th and decided to submit a public letter to Japanese Prime Minister Hayato Ikeda, questioning his domestic and foreign policies.

　　The public letter raises a total of ten questions. The public letter asks whether Ikeda is preparing to revise the Constitution. The public letter states that Ikeda once said that if the people strongly oppose it, the Constitution will not be revised. Then, before revising the Constitution, will a general election be held to solicit the opinions of the people?

　　In the public letter, the Socialist Party reveals that the Ikeda Cabinet is preparing to expand its military strength, and points out that according to the second five-year military expansion plan, Japan's military spending will reach 300 billion yen in 1964, which is double the current military spending.

　　The public letter also accuses the Ikeda Cabinet of conspiring to revive militarist education under the pretext of "inspiring patriotic spirit" and other slogans. The Socialist Party asks whether he intends to guarantee the maintenance of peace and democratic education.

　　In the public letter, the Socialist Party points out that due to the Kishi Nobusuke Cabinet's unfriendly policy towards China, Japan's relations with China have fallen into a stalemate, and the Ikeda Cabinet seems to have inherited Kishi Nobusuke's line. The Socialist Party points out that it is the wish of the Japanese people to restore diplomatic relations with China as soon as possible. It asks Ikeda whether he has the determination to actively restore Japan-China diplomatic relations regardless of the United States' policy.

　　When the public letter touches upon economic issues, it asks whether Ikeda intends to change the economic policy that serves monopoly capital and guarantee to the people that social insurance issues will be given priority in the next year's budget. The public letter points out that prices have continued to rise recently, and the people's lives are becoming increasingly impoverished, and asks what countermeasures he has for this.

　　The Socialist Party also decided to request the convocation of a special session of the Diet for at least two weeks in order to fully discuss the issues raised in the public letter. Prior to this, the Japan Socialist Party had published a four-year policy plan on the 13th, advocating the establishment of a democratic and neutral government centered on the Socialist Party to change Japan's current foreign, domestic, economic, and cultural policies.

　　Regarding foreign affairs, the policy plan advocates that Japan conclude peace treaties with China and the Soviet Union, abolish all restrictions on trade with China and the Soviet Union, and restore Japan-China trade. The plan also advocates promoting economic and technical cooperation with Asian and African countries, and increasing exports to the United States and Europe.

　　The policy plan advocates abolishing the current "Defense Agency," canceling military spending, and transforming the Japanese army into a "peaceful homeland construction corps."

　　In this policy plan, the Socialist Party advocates the planned development of the Japanese economy, shortening working hours, increasing employment, establishing a minimum wage system, expanding social insurance, and implementing a fully free compulsory education system.

    日本社会党决定提出公开质问信
    揭露池田内阁正在准备扩军
    新华社17日讯　东京消息：日本社会党中央执行委员会16日举行会议，决定向日本首相池田勇人提出公开信，质问他的对内对外政策。
    公开信共提到十个问题。公开信质询池田是否准备修改宪法？公开信说，池田曾经说过，如果人民强烈反对，就不修改宪法。那末，在修改宪法以前是否要举行大选来征询人民的意见？
    社会党在公开信中揭露池田内阁正在准备扩充军备，并且指出，按照第二个五年扩军计划，日本的军费在1964年将达到三千亿日元，等于现在军费的一倍。
    公开信还指责池田内阁假借“振奋爱国精神”等口实阴谋复活军国主义教育。社会党质询他是否有意保证要维护和平和民主教育？
    社会党在公开信里指出，由于岸信介内阁对中国采取不友好政策，使日本同中国的关系陷入僵局，池田内阁看来继承了岸信介的路线。社会党指出，尽速恢复同中国的邦交是日本人民的愿望。它质询池田是否有不管美国的方针如何而自己积极恢复日中邦交的决心。
    公开信谈到经济问题时，问池田是否有意改变为垄断资本服务的经济政策，并向人民保证在明年度预算中优先处理社会保险问题？公开信指出，最近以来物价继续上涨，人民的生活日益穷困，并且质问他对此有何对策？
    社会党同时决定，将要求召开为期至少两周的国会临时会议，以便充分讨论公开信所提出的各项问题。在这以前日本社会党曾经在13日发表四年施政计划，主张成立以社会党为中心的民主、中立政府，改变日本现行的外交、内政、经济、文化政策。
    关于外交方面，施政计划主张日本同中国和苏联缔结和约，取消同中国和苏联贸易的一切限制，恢复日中贸易。计划并且主张促进同亚非国家的经济和技术合作，增加对美国和欧洲的出口。
    施政计划主张撤销现在的“防卫厅”，取消军费，把日本军队改变为“和平国土建设队”。
    社会党在这个施政计划中主张有计划地发展日本经济，缩短工作时间，增加就业，建立最低限度的工资制，扩大社会保险、实行全部免费的义务教育制度。
