Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 14th: Hakama Tamisato, a member of the Central Committee of the Japanese Communist Party, told Japanese reporters today that the treaty and agreements concluded between China and Guinea are a manifestation of China's policy of opposing colonialism and supporting the struggle of people of all countries for national independence.

	Hakama made these remarks when talking about the signing of a treaty of friendship, a trade and payment agreement, and an agreement on economic and technical cooperation between China and Guinea.

	He pointed out that not long ago, China and Cuba announced the establishment of diplomatic relations. He said that these facts are a heavy blow to the U.S. imperialists and encourage the people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America.

	Okakura Koshiro, permanent director of the Japan-Asia-Africa Solidarity Committee, told Japanese reporters that the treaty of friendship concluded between China and Guinea is the first treaty China has concluded with an African country. It will have a profound impact on the emerging independent African countries.

	He also drew people's attention to the significance of the joint communiqué issued by the Chairman of the People's Republic of China and the President of Guinea, expressing their sincere support for the newly independent central government of the Congo. He said: "At a time when the imperialist camp is using the United Nations to interfere in the internal affairs of the Congo and oppress the Congolese people, the issuance of this joint communiqué by China and Guinea is of epoch-making significance."

Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 14th: Nosaka Sanzō, Chairman of the Japanese Communist Party, issued a statement yesterday saying that the Japanese Communist Party supports Premier Zhou Enlai's remarks on the issue of Japan-China trade.

	Nosaka stated that the Japanese Communist Party will actively work with the business community in the future to restore and develop trade relations between Japan and China.

	Hakama Tamisato, a member of the Central Committee of the Japanese Communist Party, said at a press conference today that it is necessary for the governments of Japan and China to conclude a trade agreement.

	He pointed out that it is necessary for the Japanese people to urge the Japanese government to adopt a correct policy on this issue.

	He then said that the Japanese Communist Party will spare no effort to cooperate with those trading companies that hope for the normalization of diplomatic relations between Japan and China and oppose the Japanese government's policy of hostility towards China.

	He hoped that the Socialist Party would take joint action with the Communist Party to promote trade with China.
