    Everlasting Agricultural Production
	Yang Ling
    When discussing "Agriculture is the foundation of the national economy," some people raised the opinion that agriculture is only the foundation of the national economy in a certain historical period. In the future, as a result of highly developed science and technology, food and industrial raw materials can be manufactured by the chemical industry, agriculture will no longer exist, and of course, it will no longer be the foundation of the national economy. Some people also put forward this view: Communist society wants to eliminate the difference between industry and agriculture, to completely realize agricultural industrialization, agriculture and industry will be the same, both become industry, agriculture will no longer exist, and naturally it can't be said to be the foundation of the national economy.
    What is the future of agricultural development? This is a question worth exploring. Although this is talking about the distant future, it cannot but affect people's current attitude and actions towards agriculture. Whether people talk about the past or the future, it cannot but be a reflection of the attitude taken towards reality. The argument that "agriculture will eventually be replaced by the chemical industry" is essentially a pessimistic view of agricultural development, that is, it does not believe that agriculture can develop rapidly, does not believe that agricultural development can adapt to the development of the entire socialist construction, and does not believe that agriculture has a great future.
    Speaking of the future of agriculture, some people one-sidedly believe that "land is limited and needs are endless," and are always worried about "overpopulation" on the earth. The population is constantly increasing, industry is constantly developing, will the land one day be filled with houses and factories? What should agriculture do then? In fact, these people's "land worries" are not much different from "杞人忧天" (the man of Qi who worried about the sky falling).

    		The Potential for Increased Agricultural Production is Endless
    The core of the Marxist-Leninist theory of soil fertility is: the natural fertility (potential fertility) of the land is endless, and the economic fertility (effective fertility) of the land can be continuously improved with the changes in social systems and the progress of science and technology. Therefore, Marxists and Leninists are convinced that the unit yield of crops can be continuously improved, and as long as it is rationally distributed, it can always basically meet people's needs and enable people's lives to continue to improve. This is the theoretical premise for socialist and communist societies to continuously develop agricultural production to gradually meet the growing needs of all members of society.
    As early as 1844, Engels said in "Outline of a Critique of Political Economy": "The productive forces controlled by mankind are endless. The application of capital, labor and science can infinitely increase the yield of the land." ("The Complete Works of Marx and Engels" Volume 1, page 616) This is even more obvious under the socialist system. Comrade Mao Zedong once pointed out: "Socialism not only liberates laborers and means of production from the old society, but also liberates the vast natural world that the old society could not utilize. The masses of the people have infinite creativity. They can be organized to march towards all places and departments where they can exert their strength, to march towards the depth and breadth of production, and create more and more welfare undertakings for themselves." "In the future, there will be all kinds of undertakings that people have never imagined, several times, ten times, or even dozens of times higher yields of crops than now." ("Socialist Upsurge in China's Countryside" pages 578, 675) These arguments are completely in line with the principles of agricultural science. The world-renowned Soviet soil scientist Williams, in his "Soil Science," once came to the conclusion based on his research on agricultural production, especially on agricultural soil: "There is no end to the growth of harvest." The entire history of human agriculture also proves this. The world's population is constantly increasing, and the total output and unit yield of agricultural products are always growing at a rate faster than the population growth. Otherwise, how can we explain the fact that modern people's food and clothing are much better than those of ancient people?
    Humans have been engaged in crop cultivation and animal husbandry for more than 10,000 years. Counting from the Neolithic Age when agriculture began to develop, it has been several thousand years. From stone spears, stone axes, bone hooks, wooden plows to tractors and electric motors, people have indeed come a long way and climbed very high in agriculture. But is this the end, the peak? Or will it be the end, the peak? From the perspective of the entire history of the biological world, ten thousand years is just a moment; socialist society is just the beginning of mankind mastering its own destiny. Mankind's larger-scale march towards nature has only just begun. Agriculture is by no means already at the end or about to reach the end; in fact, people's mastery of the natural laws of agriculture and the use of natural forces to develop agriculture are still in "infancy." There is still a large part of the existing arable land that has not been utilized, not to mention that with the development of biology, microbiology, chemistry, mechanics, electricity, optics, acoustics, as well as electronics, atomic energy utilization, etc., it can make land that could not be used before used to develop agriculture, and it can continuously increase the unit yield on land that has already been used.
    Judging from the current situation, land is by no means too little now and for a considerable period in the future, but far from being fully utilized. The earth's surface has about 150 million square kilometers of land (15 billion hectares, or more than 200 billion mu); according to some scientists, arable land accounts for about 40% to 60% of the land area; calculated at 40%, it is about 6 billion hectares (90 billion mu). The world's existing cultivated land (including orchards) is about 1.3 billion hectares (about 20 billion mu), less than a quarter of the total arable land area. China's total land area is about 14 billion mu, of which: arable land area is about 1.6 billion mu, and it is estimated that there are more than 1 billion mu of arable land; forest area is about 1 billion mu; grassland is about 4 billion mu; barren hills are about 4 billion mu; inland water surface is about 300 million mu; there are also fishing grounds of about 2 billion mu in the vast sea. A considerable part of these lands and water surfaces have not been fully utilized. There is also great potential in the cultivated land, and expanding multiple cropping can increase the sown area by several hundred million mu.
    Malthus fabricated the "famous theory" that "population increases in geometric progression, and food increases in arithmetic progression." According to his statement, if the population doubles every twenty-five years, the world's population should be more than 50 billion by now since he said this. In fact, according to the latest statistics published by the United Nations agencies, the total world population is only 2.9 billion. And the speed of increase in means of livelihood far exceeds the speed of population increase. This is especially obvious in socialist countries. China's total agricultural output value has increased by an average of about 10% per year in ten years, while the population only increases by about 2% per year. Historical facts also prove that there is no absolute overpopulation under any social system; there is only relative "overpopulation" in capitalist society. In 1950, when millions of people in the capitalist world and the United States were starving, the US Department of Agriculture, for the benefit of the capitalists, ordered the destruction of 1.36 million tons of potatoes, 290 million dozen eggs, and 20 million US dollars worth of milk. This year's February issue of the American "Time" magazine said that the total value of agricultural products accumulated in the United States due to the inability to sell them was 3 billion US dollars in 1953 and reached more than 9 billion US dollars in 1959. At the beginning of this year, Eisenhower's State of the Union address asked Congress to find ways to greatly reduce the cultivated land area. On the other hand, Kennedy, who is running for President of the United States, had to admit that 17 million Americans "go to bed hungry every night." In Argentina, under the pressure of American monopoly organizations, from 1940 to 1950, the grain sown area was reduced by two-thirds. Where can it be seen from this that there is too little land and overpopulation?
    In fact, the average annual population growth rate in capitalist countries has been declining, while poverty and unemployment have been increasing. Some modern Malthusians are shouting wildly that "the earth is overpopulated" and "the potential of land is limited." Their purpose is only: 1. To defend the capitalist system; 2. To attack the socialist system; 3. To pave the way for imperialist aggressive war. The notorious American modern Malthusian Vogt even said fiercely: "Famine in China may not only be appropriate, but also necessary." He advocated germ warfare and resolutely advocated the mass slaughter of Chinese and Indians; even for the Soviet Union, which has more land, Vogt also proposed to eliminate half of the Soviet population. How shameless and crazy these guys are! Their "theories" are thus serving dying capitalism and imperialism. And they even carry the banner of "humanitarianism"! The soil for these villains to cultivate their "theories" is the agricultural crisis caused under the capitalist system, and at the same time, they also use some people's "worries" about the future of agricultural development in this situation.
    Vogt fabricated that maintaining a person's normal living standard requires two and a half acres (about fifteen mu) of cultivated land. If you believe such nonsense, then you really have to worry about agriculture and mankind. However, nonsense is nonsense after all, not fact. People who doubt the future of agriculture because they are worried about "insufficient land" may wish to look at this example: Huangyan County, Zhejiang Province, is famous for producing "Huangyan tangerines". There is a Chengjiang People's Commune, and there is a Huijiang Production Team in this commune. This production team has an average of only eight cents of land per person, of which tangerine land accounts for four cents and three li, and grain land accounts for three cents and seven li. Their grain yield per mu was 860 jin in 1957; in 1959, it reached 1,231 jin; and this year's early rice was another bumper harvest. This summer, they kept enough rations, seeds, and feed, increased reserves, and sold more than 7,000 jin of surplus grain. They raised more than 1,000 pigs, an average of more than three per mu of land; and more than 2,000 chickens, ducks, and geese, an average of more than 20 per household. Their tangerines yielded 4,081 jin per mu in 1957 and 6,008 jin per mu in 1959. Why is their grain yield high? Because the land is well utilized, their multiple cropping index of paddy fields reached more than 240% in 1959. Leguminous plants were also intercropped in the tangerine orchards, which improved the fertility of the tangerine land and yielded more beans. Raising more pigs and having more fertilizer also greatly improved the land. Look, as long as we manage it well, how much can we get from limited land! An average of three cents and seven li of grain land per person can achieve self-sufficiency in grain with a surplus. According to this calculation, we can increase grain production by how much just based on the existing cultivated land! Who can say that the production of the Huijiang Production Team has reached its limit?
    Marxists are convinced that land fertility will never be exhausted, and agriculture will always be the source of people's lives. Engels firmly opposed the "theory" that "more people and less land are the cause of poverty." He said in "Outline of a Critique of Political Economy": "New Holland (note: this is the old name of Australia) has an average of only one savage per square mile, but it also feels the pain of overpopulation there as in England. In short, if we are willing to be more thorough, then we have to admit that when there is only one person on the earth, it is already overpopulated." ("The Complete Works of Marx and Engels" Volume 1, pages 617-618) He pointed out that this "theory" is despicable and is a malicious slander against nature and mankind.
    Similar debates also occurred more than half a century ago. At the end of the nineteenth century, Russian revisionists tried to prove that "dogmatic Marxism" had "been forced to abandon its position" on the land issue, and tried to prove that Marxism "does not apply to agriculture." At that time, these "critics of Marx" also vigorously promoted the "law of diminishing land fertility," attempting to prove the "limitation of land productivity" in order to defend the crimes of the capitalist system; they also believed that there was no superiority in using machines in agriculture, and believed that "agricultural machines cannot increase production indefinitely like industrial machines." In 1901, Lenin thoroughly exposed the hypocrisy, ignorance, and fallacies of these "critics" with a large number of facts and logical power, pointing out that in the case of continuous progress in science and technology and continuous changes in production methods, land fertility can be continuously improved, agricultural production can be continuously increased, and the decisive factor is the mode of production, is the social system.

              The Characteristics of Agriculture Cannot Be Obliterated
    Lenin pointed out in "The Agrarian Question and the 'Critics of Marx'": "Agriculture has many characteristics that absolutely cannot be obliterated (if we put aside the extremely slim and undecided question of possibly manufacturing proteins and food in the laboratory). Because of these characteristics, large-scale machine production in agriculture will never possess all the characteristics of large-scale machine production in industry, this is one aspect." ("The Complete Works of Lenin" Volume 5, page 119) On the other hand, Lenin pointed out how great victories can be achieved by applying large-scale machine production in agriculture, especially after the realization of electrification, how quickly the labor productivity of agriculture can be improved, and the mechanization and electrification of agriculture have the same bright future as the mechanization and electrification of industry.
    Marxists are the most full of great ideals, and are also based on a solid foundation in reality. When Lenin was severely criticizing the absurd attempts of the "critics of Marx" to revive Malthusianism, he did not rely on the fantasy of "artificial food" to help, he "set aside" this "extremely slim and undecided" question. Because, true science cannot be produced in the air. Man-made food and man-made fibers, although possible, and already partially realized; however, in any case, they cannot replace agriculture, but can only serve as a supplementary source of means of livelihood. The main source of basic means of livelihood, especially the source of food, has been agriculture in any past society, and it can only be agriculture in socialist and even communist societies. Agriculture will inevitably be industrialized, but it will inevitably always have characteristics different from industry; agriculture will inevitably continue to progress and will always be able to shoulder its important tasks in the entire national economy.
    In communist society, the difference between industry and agriculture will be eliminated. However, no Marxist classic work has told us that the elimination of the difference between industry and agriculture is the elimination of agriculture. The elimination of the difference between industry and agriculture mainly refers to: both industry and agriculture become socialist ownership by the whole people and even communist ownership by the whole people, and both use machines, electricity, and the most advanced science and technology for production. However, in terms of the natural characteristics of production, there will always be differences between industry and agriculture. The characteristics of agriculture are the cultivation of plants and animals (the broadest sense of agriculture, also including the collection and capture of plants and animals, as well as the initial processing of agricultural products). The object of agricultural labor is mainly living organisms, the relationship with the natural environment and seasons is particularly close, and it is affected by various conditions. is particularly complex. The social reproduction process of agriculture is combined with the natural reproduction process. In agricultural production, through human subjective efforts, using natural conditions, using the synthetic and decomposition effects of plants and animals themselves, products can be continuously increased and reproduced.
    Here, there are certainly unfavorable conditions, that is: living things have their own laws of growth and development, the relationship with the natural environment is very complex, and the laws of changes in the natural environment are also difficult to grasp; however, what is more important are the favorable conditions, that is: natural reproduction can be fully utilized. The possibility of developing man-made fibers and man-made food should of course also be used as much as possible. However, what reason is there to throw aside the huge natural forces and replace agricultural products with completely man-made products? The reproduction and growth of plants and animals are restricted by seasons, regions, and various conditions, this is a fact; however, with the changes in production relations and the accelerated development of productive forces, especially the improvement of the laboring people's enthusiasm for production and the progress of modern science and technology, it is also an undeniable fact that the restrictions on the growth and reproduction of plants and animals can be broken through in an increasingly large range.
    "In agriculture, generally speaking, natural forces have been working together from the beginning; in agriculture, human labor has been enhanced from the beginning by the application and utilization of natural forces as an automaton. However, the large-scale utilization of natural forces in industry only manifests itself with the development of large industries." (Marx: "Theories of Surplus Value" Volume 1, page 42) The improvement of labor productivity is mainly reflected in the improvement of the degree to which people use natural forces. The progress of all natural sciences is also the progress of people's ability to use natural forces. Bulgakov, one of the "critics of Marx" criticized by Lenin, once said: "As time goes by, more and more productive labor falls on people's shoulders; and as everywhere else, artificial processes increasingly replace natural processes. If, in industry, this phenomenon reflects the victory of man over nature, then, in agriculture, it indicates that survival is becoming increasingly difficult, because the gifts of nature are diminishing. ... The price that people pay for obtaining food is getting higher and higher. Replacing natural forces with human labor and replacing the natural factors of production with the artificial factors of production is the law of diminishing land fertility." Lenin pointed out that Bulgakov here fell to the level of vulgar economics. "Generally speaking, human labor cannot replace natural forces, just as a Russian foot cannot replace a pood. Whether in industry or agriculture, people can only recognize and utilize the effects of natural forces, and reduce the difficulty of utilization with the help of machines and tools, etc. It is a clumsy fairy tale to say that the necessities obtained by primitive people are free gifts from nature. Even students who have just entered university will boo Mr. Bulgakov. This golden age has never existed in the past. The difficulties of survival and the difficulties of fighting against nature severely oppressed primitive people. The adoption of machines and more perfect production methods makes it much easier for mankind to carry out this struggle, especially the production of food." ("The Complete Works of Lenin" Volume 5, page 89) It is very clear that the essence of the agricultural problem does not lie in what "artificial processes are increasingly replacing natural processes"; in all production, natural forces have been playing a role under the control of human power from the beginning, and human power and natural forces cannot be separated in production, and casually denying any aspect will fall into a great error.

 	The victory of socialism and communism opens up infinitely broad prospects for agriculture
    In societies before capitalist society, the productivity of agriculture was generally higher than that of primitive industry (handicraft industry), because at that time people were comparatively better at utilizing natural forces in agriculture. Later, the productivity of industry rapidly improved and caught up with agriculture. From the production itself, the reason is that people were comparatively better at utilizing natural forces in industry later. "Leaving aside all other economic circumstances which are partly decisive, such a fact is already explained by the fact that the mechanical sciences, especially their applications, have developed earlier and faster, while chemistry, geology and physiology, especially their applications in agriculture, have developed later and are partly still very immature." (Marx: "Capital" Volume 3, page 991) The capitalist system makes the capital mainly formed in industry and commerce oppress agriculture, and the capital in agriculture only cares about the greatest immediate profit and utilizes the land in a predatory manner; therefore, the application of natural forces in agriculture cannot make rapid progress for a long time as in industry, and sometimes even rudely destroys natural forces. This cannot but affect the development of agricultural science and make it remain in a "very immature" state for a long time. In colonies and dependent countries under the brutal rule and cruel exploitation of capitalism, farmers are subjected to the dual oppression of foreign enslavers and local feudal landlords, capitalists, and usurers. Agriculture becomes an appendage of the suzerain state and is increasingly impoverished under the plunder of unequal exchange. In order to pursue the maximum profit, monopoly capital has turned many colonies and dependent countries that were originally agricultural countries into grain importing countries. Millions of farmers have lost their land or only have very little barren land. This small, scattered small-scale peasant economy cannot improve the unit area yield, nor can it resist even not very serious natural disasters. It is the inherent contradictions of the entire capitalist system that have caused the backwardness of agriculture. The phenomenon of agriculture lagging behind industry cannot but be left to the primary stage of communism, so that the difference between industry and agriculture and the difference between urban and rural areas must exist in socialist society for a considerable period. During this period, after the fundamental changes in production relations, farmers have not only been liberated from the shackles of feudalism and capitalism, but have also formed powerful collectives from scattered households; the relationship between urban and rural areas and between workers and peasants has also become a relationship of mutual cooperation and mutual promotion, and the development speed of agriculture has begun to accelerate. The liberated and organized workers and peasants, under the correct leadership of the proletarian party, will surely be able to work together to gradually catch up with or approach the level of industry in terms of the human control and utilization of natural forces in agriculture; and they will surely be able to make industry and agriculture advance side by side, promote each other, and raise the entire social productive forces to a higher level more quickly. Seeing agriculture as backward, low-level, without a future, without hope, and bound to be eliminated is essentially looking at the phenomena peculiar to capitalist society with a fixed eye, and is essentially holding a skeptical and pessimistic attitude towards socialist construction.
    The fundamental starting point of our "Eight-Character Charter" for agriculture lies in the recognition that human power is infinite and land power is infinite, in correctly treating the relationship between human subjective initiative and natural forces, and in correctly reflecting the objective laws of nature with scientific laws. The focus of the agricultural "Eight-Character Charter" is not only on the increase in output in a certain period, but also on the infinite improvement of land fertility; not only on the increase in agricultural output, but also on the continuous improvement of agricultural labor productivity. It is a "constitution" for constantly increasing production, and also a "constitution" for constantly improving land power. It points out to us the bright and magnificent prospects of unlimited breadth and depth of agriculture. Under the capitalist system, which takes squeezing human power and plundering land power as its "ability," it is not only impossible to produce a magic weapon like the agricultural "Eight-Character Charter," but it is also impossible to apply it even if you take this magic weapon. Strictly speaking, in capitalist society, people are at most wandering in the courtyard of agricultural science; under the socialist system, with the golden key of the agricultural "Eight-Character Charter," we can open the main entrance of the hall of agricultural science and embark on the road of "ascending to the hall and entering the room." In human history, the era when agriculture shines brightly has only just begun. It is simply talking in a dream to say "the elimination of agriculture" at this time.
    Of course, we must not ignore the current situation of agriculture, especially the current situation of agriculture in our country. It is correct to say that agriculture in our country is relatively backward. Agriculture in our country has made unprecedented and tremendous achievements in the past ten years; however, because it has just been liberated from the heavy pressure of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism, the "foundation" is very weak, agricultural production is basically manual labor, and there are very few chemical fertilizers. Problems such as unstable agricultural production and long cycles, which have not yet been solved worldwide, have not yet been solved in our country. The national average unit yield of various crops is also not high. However, the conclusion that "agriculture has no future" cannot be drawn from these places; on the contrary, these situations precisely indicate that there is an extremely broad world in agriculture waiting for people with lofty aspirations to open up. Fully understanding the current situation is precisely for the purpose of accelerating the transformation of the current situation. We neither complain about the heavens nor blame others, but we must unite and work together to fight against nature, turn low yield into high yield, turn high yield into higher yield, turn unstable yield into relatively stable yield, and turn a longer production cycle into a shorter production cycle; we must further manage the sky, manage the land, manage the mountains, manage the water, manage plants, manage animals, and manage all life. Agriculture is the foundation of economic development in all societies; however, the foundation of a thatched house is not the same as the foundation of a high-rise building. In our hands, we must make it a new foundation that can bear ten thousand feet of high-rise buildings and millions of buildings, which is both wide and thick and incomparably strong.
    Dealing with soil, dealing with crops, dealing with pigs, cattle, horses, sheep, spring plowing, summer weeding, autumn harvest, and winter storage is by no means "the same old routine" or "too monotonous," but it is very simple and there is a lot of knowledge. In the era of people's communes, on the one hand, marching towards nature has the best organizational form; on the other hand, large collectives, large scale, coupled with new technologies and new equipment, things are not simple, and there is infinite knowledge. The knowledge of today's agricultural university graduates is not "useless" when taken to rural people's communes, but is far from enough. All mankind's knowledge in agriculture is still very limited. The origin of life and the full laws of life phenomena have not yet been grasped; the application of existing modern scientific knowledge in agriculture is still only sporadic. From socialism to communism, agriculture will inevitably continue to develop and remain evergreen for ten thousand years; agriculture can supply people with increasingly rich products, and will always need people to contribute their strength and talent to it. Chairman Mao has already pointed out a bright road for us: "The countryside is a vast world where much can be accomplished." ("Socialist Upsurge in China's Countryside" page 795)

    农业生产万古长青	杨岭
    在讨论“农业是国民经济的基础”的时候，有人提出了这样的意见：农业只是在一定的历史时期是国民经济的基础；将来，科学技术高度发展的结果，食品和日用品工业原料都可以由化学工业制造出来，农业就不存在了，当然也就不再是国民经济的基础了。也有人提出这样的见解：共产主义社会要消灭工业和农业的差别，要彻底实现农业工业化，农业和工业一样了，都成工业了，农业也就不存在了，自然也就说不上是国民经济的基础了。
    农业的发展前途究竟怎么样？这是值得探讨的一个问题。这虽然谈的是遥远的将来的事情，但是却不能不影响人们现在对于农业的态度和行动。人们无论是谈论过去还是谈论将来，都不能不是对现实所采取的态度的反映。“农业终归要被化学工业所代替”的论调，实质上是对农业的发展所持的悲观论，即不相信农业能够迅速发展，不相信农业的发展能够同整个社会主义建设的发展相适应，更不相信农业有远大的发展前途。
    谈到农业的前途，有一些人片面地认为“土地有限而需要无穷”，总担心地球上会有“人满之患”。人口在不断增加，工业在不断发展，土地会不会有那么一天要被住宅和工厂占满呢？那时候农业该怎么办呢？其实，这些人的“忧地”同“杞人忧天”也差不了许多。
              农业的增产潜力是无穷无尽的
    马克思列宁主义的土壤肥力学说的核心，就是：土地的自然肥力（潜在肥力）是无穷无尽的，土地的经济肥力（有效肥力）随着社会制度的变革和科学技术的进步能够不断提高。因此，马克思列宁主义者确信，农作物的单位产量能够不断提高，只要合理分配，总能同人们的需要基本上相适应，而且能使人们的生活不断改善。这是社会主义社会和共产主义社会能够不断发展农业生产以逐步满足全体社会成员日益增长的需要的理论前提。
    恩格斯早在1844年就在《政治经济学批判大纲》中说过：“人类所支配的生产力是无穷无尽的。应用资本、劳动和科学就可以使土地的收获量无限地提高。”（《马克思恩格斯全集》第1卷，第616页）这在社会主义制度下表现得更加明显。毛泽东同志曾指出：“社会主义不仅从旧社会解放了劳动者和生产资料，也解放了旧社会所无法利用的广大的自然界。人民群众有无限的创造力。他们可以组织起来，向一切可以发挥自己力量的地方和部门进军，向生产的深度和广度进军，替自己创造日益增多的福利事业。”“将来会出现从来没有被人们设想过的种种事业，几倍、十几倍以至几十倍于现在的农作物的高产量。”（《中国农村的社会主义高潮》第578页，第675页）这些论断都是完全符合农业科学原理的。世界著名的苏联土壤学家威廉斯在他的《土壤学》中，就曾根据他对于农业生产特别是对于农业土壤研究的结果，得出了这样的结论：“收获的增长是没有止境的。”人类经营农业的全部历史，也证明了这一点。世界上的人口总是在不断地增加，而农产品的总产量和单位产量也总是以比人口增长的速度更快的速度增长着。不然，现代人的衣食比古代人的衣食要好得多这个事实该怎样解释呢？
    人类从事种植业、饲养业已经有一万多年的历史，从农业开始发达起来的新石器时代算起，也已经有了几千年的历史。由石矛、石斧、骨钩、木犁到拖拉机、电动机，人们在农业方面的确已经前进了很远，攀登得很高。可是，这就到头了、到顶了吗？或者说，将要到头、到顶了吗？从整个生物界的历史来说，一万年也不过是一瞬间；社会主义社会不过是人类掌握自己的命运的开始。人类更大规模地向大自然进军也不过刚刚开始。农业决不是已经发展到了尽头或者将要发展到尽头；实际上，人们掌握农业的自然规律，利用自然力发展农业，也还处于“幼年时期”。现有的可耕地还有很大部分没有利用，更不要说随着生物学、微生物学、化学、力学、电学、光学、声学以及电子学、原子能利用等等的发展，能使原来不能利用的土地也利用来发展农业，能使原来已经利用的土地上的单位产量不断地提高再提高。
    就现实情况来看，现在以至今后相当长时期内，土地决不是已经太少了，而是远没有充分利用。地球表面大约有土地一亿五千万平方公里（一百五十亿公顷，或二千多亿亩）；据一些科学家计算，可耕地大约占陆地面积的40％到60％；按40％计算就是大约六十亿公顷（九百亿亩）。世界上现有耕地（包括果园在内）大约十三亿多公顷（约二百亿亩），不到可耕地总面积的四分之一。我国土地总面积约一百四十多亿亩，其中：耕地面积约十六亿多亩，估计可耕地还有十几亿亩；森林面积约十几亿亩；草原约四十多亿亩；荒山约四十亿亩；内陆水面约三亿多亩；在辽阔的海面还有渔场约二十多亿亩。这些土地和水面，相当大一部分还没有充分利用。已耕地也还有很大的潜力，只是扩大复种就可以再增加播种面积几亿亩。
    马尔萨斯捏造的“著名理论”说，“人口是按几何级数增加，食物是按算术级数增加”。如果按照他的说法，人口二十五年增加一倍，地球上的人口从他说这话的时候算起，到现在该是五百多亿了。实际上，据最近联合国机构发表的统计，世界人口总数才二十九亿。而生活资料的增加速度，远超过人口增加速度。在社会主义国家，这一点尤其明显。我国农业总产值十年间平均每年增加10％左右，而人口每年只增加2％左右。历史
  事实也证明，在任何社会制度下，都没有绝对的人口过剩；在
  资本主义社会也只有相对的“人口过剩”。1950年，当资本主义世界和美国国内千百万人正在挨饿的时候，美国农业部为了资本家的利益，却下令销毁了一百三十六万吨马铃薯、二亿九千万打鸡蛋、价值二千万美元的牛奶。今年2月出版的美国《时代》周刊上说，美国由于无法销售而堆积起来的农产品总值，1953年是三十亿美元，1959年达到九十多亿美元。今年年初艾森豪威尔的国情咨文里要求国会设法大量缩小耕地面积。另方面，正在竞选美国总统的肯尼迪却不得不承认，有一千七百万美国人“每天晚上饿着肚子上床”。在阿根廷，在美国垄断组织的压力下，从1940年到1950年，把粮食播种面积缩小了三分之二。这从哪里可以看出是土地太少、人口过剩呢？
    实际上，资本主义国家每年平均人口增长速度一直在下降，而贫困和失业现象一直在增加。一些现代马尔萨斯主义者狂叫“地球人口过剩”，“土地潜力有限”，其目的不过是：一、为资本主义制度辩护；二、向社会主义制度进攻；三、为帝国主义侵略战争开路。美国的臭名远扬的现代马尔萨斯主义者范格特甚至这样恶狠狠地说：“饥馑在中国，也许不仅是适当的，而且是必需的。”他鼓吹细菌战，坚决主张大量残杀中国人、印度人；即使对土地比较多的苏联，范格特也提出要消灭苏联人口的一半。这些家伙是多么无耻而又多么疯狂！他们的“理论”，就是这样为垂死的资本主义和帝国主义效劳的。而他们竟然也打着“人道主义”的旗子呢！这些恶棍培植他们的“理论”的土壤，是在资本主义制度下造成的农业危机，同时也利用了一些人们在这情况下对农业的发展前途的“担忧”。
    范格特杜撰：维持一个人的正常生活水平，需要二英亩半（约合十五亩）耕地。如果相信这样的胡诌，那就真要为农业、为人类担忧了。可是，胡诌毕竟是胡诌，而不是事实。因担心“土地不足”而对农业的前途发生怀疑的人们，不妨看看这个事例：浙江省黄岩县，就是以生产“黄岩蜜桔”著名的地方，有个澄江人民公社，这个公社有个汇江生产队。这个生产队平均每人只有八分地，其中桔地四分三，粮地三分七。他们的粮食亩产量，1957年是八百六十斤；1959年，达到一千二百三十一斤；今年的早稻又是丰收。他们今年夏季留足了口粮、种子、饲料，增加了储备量，还卖了七千多斤余粮。他们养猪一千多头，平均每亩地合三头多；养鸡、鸭、鹅二千多只，平均每户合二十多只。他们的桔子，1957年亩产四千零八十一斤，1959年亩产六千零八斤。他们的粮食产量为什么高？因为土地利用得好，他们的水田复种指数，1959年已经达到240％以上。在桔园里又套种了豆科植物，提高了桔地的肥力，又多收了豆子。养猪多，肥料多，也大大提高了地力。看，只要经营得好，我们可以在有限的土地上得到多少东西！每人平均三分七厘粮地就可以做到粮食自给有余，依此计算，只就现有耕地来说，我们就可以增产多少粮食！谁又能说，汇江生产队的生产已经到了极限呢？
    马克思主义者确信，地力永远不会枯竭，农业永远是人们的生命的源泉。恩格斯坚决地反对“人多地少是贫穷的原因”的“学说”，他在《政治经济学批判大纲》里说过：“新荷兰（按：这是澳大利亚的旧称）平均每平方英里只有一个野蛮人，但是那里也和英国一样，深感人口过剩的痛苦。简言之，要是我们愿意彻底一些，那我们就得承认：当地球上还只有一个人的时候，就已经人口过剩了。”（《马克思恩格斯全集》第1卷，第617—618页）他指出，这种“学说”是卑鄙下流的，是对自然和人类的恶毒的诬蔑。
    类似的争辩在大半个世纪以前也曾发生过。十九世纪末，俄国的修正主义者力图证明“教条式的马克思主义”在土地问题方面已经“被迫放弃阵地”，力图证明马克思主义“不适用于农业”。那时候，这些“马克思的批评家”们又大肆宣扬“土地肥力递减规律”，企图证明“土地生产力的有限”，以此为资本主义制度的罪恶作辩护；他们还认为，在农业中使用机器也没有什么优越性，认为“农业机器不能像工业机器那样无止境地提高生产”。1901年，列宁以大量的事实和逻辑的力量彻底揭露了这些“批评家”的虚伪、无知和谬误，指出了在科学技术不断进步、生产方式不断变革的情况下，土地肥力是能够不断提高的，农业生产是能够不断增加的，起决定作用的是生产方式，是社会制度。
              农业的特点是绝对不能抹煞的
    列宁在《土地问题和“马克思的批评家”》一文中指出：“农业有着许多绝对不能抹煞的特点（如果把可能在实验室制造蛋白质和食物这一极其渺茫的和悬而未决的问题撇开不谈）。由于这些特点，农业中的大机器生产永远也不会具备工业大机器生产的全部特点，这是一方面。”（《列宁全集》第5卷，第119页）另一方面，列宁又指出，在农业中应用大机器生产，特别是实现电气化以后，会取得多么巨大的胜利，会使农业的劳动生产率多么快地提高，农业的机械化、电气化同工业的机械化、电气化一样有光辉的前途。
      马克思主义者是最富于伟大的理想的，也是立足于现实的坚实的基础上的。列宁在痛击“马克思的批评家”妄想复活马尔萨斯主义的荒谬企图的时候，一点也不指望“人造食物”的空想来帮忙，他把这个“极其渺茫的和悬而未决的”问题“撇开不谈”。因为，真正的科学是不能在空中楼阁中产生出来的。人造食物，人造纤维，虽然有可能，而且已经部分地成为现实；但是，无论如何，它们不能代替农业，而只能作为生活资料的一种补充来源。基本生活资料的主要来源，特别是食物的来源，在过去的任何社会里都是农业，在社会主义以至共产主义社会里，也仍然只能是农业。农业必然要工业化，但是也必然永远具有与工业不同的特点；农业必然会不断进步，永远能够担负起来它在整个国民经济中的重大任务。
    到了共产主义社会，工业和农业的差别是要消灭的。可是，任何一本马克思主义的经典著作也没有告诉过我们，工业和农业的差别的消灭就是农业的消灭。工业和农业的差别的消灭，主要是指的：工业和农业都成为社会主义的全民所有制以至共产主义的全民所有制，都是使用机器、电力和最先进的科学技术进行生产。但是，就生产的自然特征来说，工业和农业总是会有区别的。农业的特点是培育植物和动物（最广义的农业，还要加上采集、捕捉植物和动物，以及农业品的初步加工），农业劳动对象主要是活着的生物，同自然环境和季节的关系特别密切，受各种条件的影响特别复杂。农业的社会再生产过程是同自然再生产过程结合在一起的。在农业生产中，可以通过人的主观努力，利用自然条件，利用植物、动物本身的合成作用和分解作用，使产品不断地增殖繁衍。
    在这里，固然有不利的条件，就是：活的东西有它自己的生长发育规律，同自然环境的关系又很复杂，而自然环境的变化的规律也很难掌握；但是，更重要的是有利的条件，就是：可以充分地利用自然再生产的力量。发展人造纤维和人造食物的可能性，当然也应该尽量利用。可是，有什么理由把巨大的自然力抛在一边，而另外完全用人造品来代替农产品呢？植物和动物的繁殖和生长要受季节、地域种种条件的限制，这是事实；可是，随着生产关系的变革和生产力的加速发展，特别是劳动人民生产热情的提高和现代科学技术的进步，能够在越来越大的范围内突破植物和动物的生长繁殖所受的限制，也是无可争辩的事实。
    “在农业上面，大体说，自始就有自然力在协同发生作用；在农业上面，人类劳动力自始就由自然力这一个自动体的运用和利用，而被增进。但自然力在工业上面的大规模的利用，却是依大工业的发展，才表现出来。”（马克思：《剩余价值学说史》第1卷，第42页）劳动生产率的提高，主要表现在人利用自然力的程度的提高。一切自然科学的进步，也就是人利用自然力的能力的进步。列宁所批判的“马克思的批评家”之一布尔加柯夫曾经这样说：“随着时间的推移，愈来愈多的生产劳动落到了人的肩上；也像在任何地方一样，人工的过程日益代替自然的过程。如果说，在工业中这种现象反映了人征服自然的胜利，那末，在农业中，这却表明生存日益困难，因为自然界的赐物减少了。……人获得食物的代价愈来愈大了。用人的劳动代替自然的力量，用生产的人工因素代替生产的自然因素，这就是土地肥力递减规律。”列宁指出，布尔加柯夫在这里堕落到了庸俗经济学的水平。“一般说来，人的劳动是无法代替自然力量的，正如俄尺不能代替普特一样。无论在工业或农业中，人只能认识和利用自然力量的作用，借助机器和工具等等减少利用的困难。说原始人获得的必需品是自然界无偿的赐物，这是笨拙的童话，连刚进大学的学生听了也会对布尔加柯夫先生喝倒采，这种黄金时代在过去从来没有过，生存的困难，同自然斗争的困难使原始人受到十分沉重的压抑。机器和更完善的生产方式的采用，使人类进行这一斗争，特别是进行食物生产容易得多了。”（《列宁全集》第5卷，第89页）很清楚，农业问题的本质全不在什么“人工的过程日益代替自然的过程”；在一切生产中，自然力自始就是在人力的支配下起作用，人力和自然力在生产中是不能分开来的，随便否定任何一方面都会陷入绝大的错误。	社会主义和共产主义的胜利为农业开辟无限广阔的前途
    在资本主义社会以前的社会里，农业的生产率一般地说比原始工业（手工业）高，就因为当时人们在农业上比较地说善于利用自然力。后来工业的生产率迅速提高，赶过了农业，就生产本身来说原因是后来人们在工业上比较地更善于运用自然力。“把一切其他的并且部分地有决定作用的经济情况除开不说，这样的事实已经由这一点说明了：机械科学，尤其是它们的应用，是发展得比较早、比较快的，化学、地质学和生理学，尤其是它们在农业上的应用，则是发展得比较晚，部分地说还是十分幼稚的。”（马克思：《资本论》第3卷，第991页）资本主义制度，使主要在工商业中形成的资本压榨着农业，农业中的资本又只顾眼前的最大利润而掠夺性地利用土地；因此，农业方面对自然力的运用长时期不能像在工业方面那样有较快的进步，有时候甚至粗暴地破坏自然力。这也不能不影响到农业科学的发展，使它长时期处于“十分幼稚”的状态。在资本主义残暴统治和残酷剥削下的殖民地、附属国，农民受着外国的奴役者和当地的封建地主、资本家和高利贷者双重的压迫，农业成为宗主国的附庸，在日益加强的不等价交换的掠夺下日益雕敝。垄断资本为追求最大限度的利润，把许多原是农业国的殖民地和附属国变成了粮食输入国。千百万农民丧失了土地或者只有极少的贫瘠的土地，这种细小、分散的小农经济无法提高单位面积产量，也无法抵抗哪怕是并不怎么严重的自然灾害。正是整个资本主义体系的内在矛盾，造成了农业的落后。农业落后于工业这种现象，不能不遗留到共产主义的初级阶段，使工业和农业的差别、城市和农村的差别在社会主义社会不得不存在一个相当长的时期。在这个时期，经过生产关系的根本变革，农民不仅从封建主义和资本主义的枷锁下解放了出来，并且由分散的农户结成了强大的集体；城乡和工农之间的关系也变成了互相协作、互相促进的关系，农业的发展速度开始加快。解放了的组织起来的工农劳动人民，在无产阶级政党的正确领导下，一定能同心协力，使农业方面人力对自然力的支配和利用逐步赶上或接近工业方面的水平；并且一定能使工业和农业并驾齐驱，互相促进，把整个社会生产力更快地提高到更高的水平。把农业看成落后的、低级的，没有前途、没有希望的，势必要消灭掉的，实质上是用固定的眼光看资本主义社会特有的现象，实质上是对社会主义建设抱着怀疑的悲观的态度。
    我们的农业“八字宪法”的根本出发点，就在于认定人力无穷、地力无穷，就在于正确地对待人的主观能动作用和自然力之间的关系，就在于正确地用科学规律反映自然的客观规律。农业“八字宪法”的着眼点不只在于一定时期内产量的增加，同时也在于土地肥力的无限提高；不只在于农业产量的增加，同时也在于农业劳动生产率的不断提高。它是不断增加生产的“宪法”，也是不断提高地力的“宪法”。它给我们指出了农业的广度无限、深度无限的光辉壮丽的远景。在以压榨人力、掠夺地力为“能事”的资本主义制度下，不但不可能产生农业“八字宪法”这样的法宝，而且把这法宝拿去也不可能应用。严格地说，在资本主义社会，人们至多不过是在农业科学的院落里徘徊；在社会主义制度下，有了农业“八字宪法”这样的金钥匙，我们就可以打开农业科学的殿堂的正门，走上“升堂入室”的道路。在人类历史上，农业大放光彩的时代，不过刚刚开始。这时候说什么“农业的消灭”，简直是说梦话。
    当然，我们决不可忽视农业的现状，特别是我国农业的现状。说我国的农业比较落后，这是对的。我国的农业十年来有了空前未有的巨大成就；可是，因为刚从帝国主义、封建主义、官僚资本主义三座大山的重压下解放出来，“底子”很薄，农业生产基本上还是手工劳动，化学肥料也很少。在世界范围内都还未能解决的农业生产不稳定和周期长等等问题，在我国也还没有解决。各种作物的全国平均的单位产量，也还不高。可是，从这些地方决得不出“农业没有前途”的结论；恰恰相反，这些情况正说明在农业方面有极其广阔的天地等待着有雄心壮志的人们去开辟。充分认识现状，正是为了加速改造现状。我们既不怨天，也不尤人，而要团结一致，同心协力，向大自然展开斗争，变低产为高产，变高产为更高产，变不稳定的产量为比较稳定的产量，变较长的生产周期为较短的生产周期；我们要进一步管天，管地，管山，管水，管植物，管动物，管一切生命。农业在一切社会都是经济发展的基础；但是茅屋的基础和大楼的基础并不相同，在我们手里，要使它成为能够承担万丈高楼、百万广厦的既广且厚而又无比坚强的新基础。
    同土块打交道，同庄稼打交道，同猪牛马羊打交道，春耕、夏耘、秋收、冬藏，决不是“老一套”“太单调”，而是很不简单，大有学问。在人民公社时代，一方面，向大自然进军有了最好的组织形式；另方面，大集体、大规模，加上新技术、新装备，事情更不简单，更有无穷学问。现在的农业大学毕业生的知识，拿到农村人民公社去也不是“没有用武之地”，而是远远地不够用。全人类在农业方面的知识也还很有限。对于生命的起源和生命现象的全部规律，至今也没有掌握住；对于已有的种种现代科学知识在农业上的运用，至今也还只是点点滴滴。从社会主义直到共产主义，农业必将不断发展，万年长青；农业能够供给人们越来越丰富的产品，也永远需要人们为它贡献力量和才智。毛主席早给我们指出了光明大道，“农村是一个广阔的天地，在那里是可以大有作为的。”（《中国农村的社会主义高潮》第795页）
