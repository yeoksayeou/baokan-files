    Fighting Waterlogging and Striving for Increased Late Autumn Production
    Dengji Commune Drains Water and Rescues Seedlings in a Timely Manner on Over 30,000 Mu of Waterlogged Land, Replanting Late Autumn Crops
    (Our Newspaper News) The Dengji Commune Party Committee in Heze City, Shandong Province, is transforming disaster into motivation and fully mobilizing the masses to carry out a production-based disaster relief campaign, which has achieved great results. All of the more than 35,000 mu of waterlogged land in the entire commune has been drained, over 10,000 mu of various crops have been rescued, and over 20,000 mu have been replanted with late autumn crops and vegetables.
    The reason why this commune has been able to achieve continuous victories in the fight against disaster is mainly because the vast majority of cadres and commune members have fully recognized the subjective initiative of people and established the idea that man can conquer nature. After this flood, most cadres and commune members were very enthusiastic and determined to recover the losses caused by the disaster. However, some people were daunted by the difficulties and lacked confidence. The commune Party committee carried out in-depth ideological mobilization work. On the one hand, they laid out the specific difficulties in the fight against disaster, and on the other hand, they spoke extensively about the excellent situation and the favorable conditions for overcoming the disaster, mobilizing the masses to summarize the experience of past disaster relief struggles and find typical examples to educate the masses. For example, the Gaohe production team of the Jianglou production brigade also suffered from floods in 1957, but because they mobilized the masses to carry out production for disaster relief, used the receding water to rush to plant various late autumn crops and vegetables, and developed sideline production, their livelihood was still basically self-sufficient. Through case study education and mass airing of views and debates, they further established the idea that man can conquer nature, and immediately used the receding water to plant 580 mu of buckwheat, mung beans, carrots, cabbage, and rapeseed.
    In order to overcome the disaster in a planned way, the commune Party committee, in the spirit of considering the worst-case scenario and striving for the best outcome, led the masses to discuss and formulate a specific plan for the production-based disaster relief struggle on the basis of ideological mobilization. They were determined to seize the last opportunity, work hard for two months, do a good job in late autumn production, turn a major disaster into a minor one, a minor disaster into no disaster, and strive for increased production where there is no disaster, and adopted specific measures. First, strengthen management measures and strive for a better harvest of the 15,000 mu of crops that were not flooded. Second, make every effort to manage and utilize the more than 20,000 mu of late autumn crops planted on the receding water land, ensuring an average of 0.7 mu of sweet potatoes, 0.6 mu of grain, and 0.3 mu of radish per person, and striving to achieve multiple planting and multiple harvesting. Third, use vacant land to grow vegetables in large quantities, collect wild vegetables in large quantities, and accumulate dried vegetables in large quantities, requiring each person to reach 1,500 jin of fresh vegetables, 300 jin of dried vegetables, and 50 jin of pickled vegetables. Fourth, vigorously develop sideline production after the autumn harvest to ensure that commune members have food to eat and money to spend. Each production team and production squad has formulated its own specific plan. In order to ensure the realization of their plans, each team divided the late autumn crops and vegetables into areas and plots, implemented a strict management responsibility system. Each work group also launched a red flag competition with each other, boosting greater enthusiasm and strengthening the management of late autumn grain crops and vegetables.
    The higher the enthusiasm of the masses, the more the leadership needs to care about the lives of the masses. The commune Party committee attached great importance to this issue. After dispatching cadres to help solve difficulties, all 107 canteens in the commune were able to provide three meals a day, with thin and thick porridge, rice and vegetables. For example, the canteen of the Jianglou production team's Jianglou squad had water in the house during the heavy rain. The administrator, Hu Chunming, led the cooks to build a threshold to block the water and poured the water out of the house, insisting on cooking. Old commune member Jiang Xueyi said: "In the old society, if we encountered such a big flood, we would have fled to beg for food. Now the canteen is still serving food as usual; with the commune and the canteen, we are not afraid of any disaster." While grasping the canteens well, the commune also organized more than 800 people to repair more than 2,000 houses for the commune members, so that the commune members had food and shelter and could devote themselves to the production-based disaster relief struggle with peace of mind.
    In the fight against disaster, the vast number of cadres in this commune shared weal and woe with the masses, and promoted the style of hard work, plain living, and burying themselves in hard work. The five secretaries of the commune Party committee all went deep into the heavily affected teams to promptly solve the difficulties in the production-based disaster relief struggle. When the Xilizhuang production team was rushing to plant, the land was too wet, so Huang Fuyou, the secretary of the production team's Party branch, led the masses to pull the seeders to rush to plant. As soon as the commune members saw them going to the ground, they immediately took action, and the whole team organized 44 seeders, and after two days of intensive work, they rushed to plant more than 700 mu. For units with heavy tasks, they also provided assistance through organized collaboration. Because the cadres set an example, eating, living, working, and discussing with the masses, many specific difficulties were quickly overcome.

    战胜涝灾力争晚秋增产
    邓集公社三万多亩受涝地及时排水救苗改种晚秋
    本报讯　山东菏泽市邓集公社党委，把灾荒变动力，充分发动群众开展生产抗灾运动，已取得很大的成绩。全社三万五千多亩积水已全部排完，抢救出各种作物一万余亩，重新改种晚秋作物和蔬菜二万多亩。
    这个社在抗灾斗争中，所以能够取得节节胜利，主要是广大干部和社员充分认识了人的主观能动作用，树立了人定胜天的思想。这次受水灾之后，多数干部社员干劲很大，决心夺回灾害造成的损失。但是，也有一部分人畏难发愁，信心不足。公社党委进行了深入的思想发动工作。一方面摆出抗灾斗争中的具体困难，一方面大讲大好形势和战胜灾荒的有利条件，发动群众总结以往抗灾斗争的经验，找出典型事例教育群众。例如姜楼生产队高河小队，1957年也曾遭受水灾，但由于发动群众进行生产救灾，利用退水地抢种了各种晚秋作物和蔬菜，开展了副业生产，生活资料仍然基本上达到自给。通过实例教育和群众性的鸣放辩论，进一步树立了人定胜天的思想，马上利用退水地种荞麦、绿豆、胡萝卜、白菜、油菜籽五百八十亩。
    为了有计划地战胜灾荒，这个社党委本着从最坏处着想，向最好处争取的精神，在思想发动的基础上，领导群众讨论制订了生产抗灾斗争的具体计划。决心抓紧最后时机，大干苦干两个月，搞好晚秋生产，把重灾变轻灾，轻灾变无灾，无灾争超产，并采取了具体措施。一、加强管理措施，力争未淹的一万五千亩作物取得更好收成。二、千方百计管好利用退水地种植的二万多亩晚秋作物，保证每人平均达到七分地瓜、六分粮食、三分萝卜，力争实现多种多收。三、利用空闲地，大种蔬菜，大量收集野菜，大积干菜，要求每人达到一千五百斤鲜菜、三百斤干菜、五十斤咸菜。四、秋后大搞副业生产，保证社员有吃、有钱花。各生产队和生产小队都制订了自己的具体计划。各队为了保证实现自己的计划，把晚秋作物和蔬菜，按片按块分工包干，实行了严格的管理责任制。各作业小组还互相展开了红旗竞赛，鼓起更大干劲，加强晚秋粮食作物和蔬菜管理。
    群众干劲越高，领导上越需要关心群众生活。这个社党委十分重视这个问题。经过派干部帮助，解决困难，全社一百零七处食堂，做到了一日三餐，有稀有干，有饭有菜。如姜楼生产队姜楼小队的食堂，在大雨中屋内进了水，管理员胡春明带领炊事员，打上门埝，把屋内的水泼出来，坚持做饭。老社员姜学义说：“在旧社会遇上这样大的水灾，早就逃荒要饭去了，现在食堂里还是照常开饭；有了公社，有了食堂，再大的灾荒我们也不怕了。”在抓好食堂的同时，这个社还组织八百多人，为社员们抢修了二千多间房屋，使社员有吃有住，安心投入生产抗灾斗争。
    这个社广大干部在抗灾斗争中，和群众同甘共苦，发扬了艰苦朴素，埋头苦干的作风。公社党委五个书记都分别深入到重灾队，及时解决生产抗灾斗争中的困难问题。西李庄生产队在突击抢种中，因地太湿，生产队党支部书记黄福祐就带领群众拉耧抢种。社员一看见他们下地，立即都动了手，全队组织了四十四张耧，经过两天突击，就抢种了七百多亩。对任务大的单位，还通过组织协作的办法进行帮助。由于干部以身作则，跟群众同吃同住同劳动同商量，许多具体困难很快都被克服了。
