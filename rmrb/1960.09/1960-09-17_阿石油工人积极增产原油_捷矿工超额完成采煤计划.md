Xinhua News Agency, Tirana, September 15th: The workers of the Stalin Oil City in Albania increased crude oil production by 3,000 tons for the state in the first eight months of this year, exceeding the drilling task by 2,200 meters. They drilled more than 14,000 meters of oil wells.

To welcome the Fourth Congress of the Albanian Labor Party, which will be held in November this year, the workers decided to increase the original guarantee of increasing crude oil production by 7,000 tons this year to 20,000 tons, and increase labor productivity from the original 1% to 7%, and reduce costs by 20 million leks (Albanian currency). At the same time, the workers of the crude oil processing plant also guaranteed to increase oil production by 7,000 tons this year. In order to fulfill the above guarantees, the workers decided to actively carry out the "Socialist Labor Team" movement and launch the "one plus two" movement of skilled workers mentoring apprentices in improving technology.

Xinhua News Agency, Prague, September 12th: Miners in Czechoslovakian coal mining areas mined 17 million tons of hard coal and 31 million tons of lignite in the first seven months of this year. The total mining volume during this period exceeded the plan by nearly 900,000 tons, and the output increased by 5.4% compared with the same period last year. Labor productivity exceeded the plan by 3%.

The miners of Czechoslovakia have brought their initiative into play in production. Now, more than 1,300 miner teams are actively striving for the title of "Socialist Labor Team." This year, the miners have widely launched a movement to produce more, save more, and better, thereby promoting the technological revolution.

Czechoslovakia has made great progress in further adopting combined coal mining machines for production. In some of the largest coal mines in the Ostrava-Karvina coal mining area, 50% of the coal is already mined with combined coal mining machines. Last month, a new world record for coal mining with combined coal mining machines was created in the Dukla coal mine.

    阿石油工人积极增产原油  捷矿工超额完成采煤计划
    据新华社地拉那15日电　阿尔巴尼亚斯大林石油城的工人在今年头八个月为国家增产了三千吨原油，超额完成了二千二百米的钻探任务。他们钻了一万四千多米的油井。
    为迎接即将在今年11月召开的阿尔巴尼亚劳动党第四次代表大会，工人们决定将原先提出的今年增产七千吨原油的保证增加到两万吨，劳动生产率从原定的1％提高到7％，并且要降低成本二千万里克（阿币名）。同时，原油加工厂的工人们也保证今年要增产七千吨石油。为了完成以上的保证，工人们决定积极开展“社会主义劳动队”运动，并在提高技术方面开展熟练工人带徒弟的“一加二”运动。
  据新华社布拉格12日电　捷克斯洛伐克各煤矿区的矿工在今年头七个月中开采了一千七百万吨硬煤和三千一百万吨褐煤。这个期间的总开采量几乎超过计划九十万吨，和去年同期比较，产量增加了5.4％。劳动生产率超过了计划的3％。
    捷克斯洛伐克的矿工们在生产中发挥了主动性。现在，有一千三百多个矿工队正在积极争取“社会主义劳动队”的称号。今年，矿工们广泛地展开了一个生产得更多、更省和更好的运动，从而推动了技术革命。
    捷克斯洛伐克在进一步采用联合采煤机进行生产方面，已经有了大的进展。在俄斯特拉发—卡尔维那煤矿区的一些最大的煤矿中，已经有50％的煤是用联合采煤机开采的。上个月在都克拉煤矿创造了用联合采煤机采煤的新的世界纪录。
