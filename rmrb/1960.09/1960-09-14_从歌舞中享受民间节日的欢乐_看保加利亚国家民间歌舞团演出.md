    Enjoying the Joy of Folk Festivals Through Song and Dance
    ——Watching the Performance of the Bulgarian National Folk Song and Dance Ensemble	　Ye Lin
    After watching the performance of the Bulgarian National Folk Song and Dance Ensemble, I deeply felt that Bulgarian folk songs and dances, like the world-renowned roses of this country, are beautiful and exude a rich fragrance of national art.
    The Bulgarian National Folk Song and Dance Ensemble is one of the famous folk song and dance ensembles well-known to people of all countries. Under the leadership of Bulgarian People's Artist Filip Kutev, this group has done much outstanding work in collecting, sorting, and processing Bulgarian folk songs, dances, and musical arts, striving to concentrate and preserve the essence of Bulgarian folk art, and has achieved excellent results. What impresses people most about this group is its complete and meaningful folk art style. Although the performances have been carefully sorted and processed, they are free of any artificiality, making the folk songs and dances that originally circulated in various aspects of people's lives more perfect and refined, and the style is purer and more distinct. Its members are also different from ordinary song and dance groups. They are all talented rural folk artists with rich artistic experience selected from previous folk song and dance competitions. They are very different from actors from specialized schools. They have lived among the people for a long time and have grown up in the influence of folk art. Therefore, every gesture and movement brings the unique atmosphere of folk art. In artistic creation, according to the needs of stage performance, they integrate various elements of Bulgarian folk art, including folk songs, music, dances, embroidery, costumes, and other folk arts and crafts from all over the country, casting one after another folk paintings of Bulgarian folk songs and dances. Its color is so strong that on the stage, it does not seem to be a performance, but rather scenes of pure Bulgarian rural life are presented, allowing you to live in it and enjoy the joy of the folk festivals full of local flavor with them.
    In the performance, what is most unforgettable is the folk chorus with a high level of artistry. The chorus of this group is entirely composed of female singers from the countryside. On the basis of folk singing methods, they have undergone rigorous training according to the requirements of choral art, preserving the various unique techniques of Bulgarian folk singing methods, while also possessing very pure and warm timbre, highly sensitive pitch concepts, and a sense of rhythm, creating an extremely rare polyphonic a cappella female chorus art in folk style.
    Filip Kutev's several a cappella choral songs in folk style are very moving. They have pure melodies and deep emotions like folk songs, and contain enthusiasm from the bottom of the heart in the not-so-wide range and calm rhythm. When the chorus sings, "People sing and work, fight for peace and happiness, they defend their motherland, unafraid of any war of aggression," what we feel from the firm rhythm and loud melody is the firm belief of the people in defending world peace and combating imperialist aggression. In the two love songs, "Farewell" and "Vida, Beautiful Vida," they also express the Bulgarian people's infinite love for the soldiers defending the socialist motherland, using the greatest trust and the most sincere feelings to praise them.
    In the singing of folk songs, the special singing methods of the lead singers and ensemble singers fully express the characteristics of Bulgarian folk songs with rich decorative phrases and linguistic characteristics. The treatment of long bass notes, unisons, octaves, and perfect fifths in the chorus part also adds special color to the chorus. The trio "Preparing to Set Off" and the small chorus "Gather Together" both express the glorious history of the Bulgarian people resisting fascism and foreign aggression. In some humorous songs and more lively and enthusiastic folk songs, they reflect the humor of the Bulgarian people's life, while also giving full play to the chorus's other strengths, the neat rhythm and accurate pitch, even at the fastest speed, can be achieved as if sung by one person.
    The folk dances of the song and dance troupe have a strong rural color. Each dance from different regions has its own characteristics, while also having consistent places that are interrelated. As a common feature, they do not emphasize the use of hand movements but are committed to developing leg footwork. These footwork are light, lively, and elastic, with many clever changes and complex techniques, fully reflecting the optimistic character and wisdom of this nation. Among them, "Lochi Cha Dance," "Pruning Grape Vines," "Shopo Region Group Dance," and "Margoton Group Dance" are all very wonderful. The two funny dances "Little Rabbit Dance" and "Doll Dance" were also warmly welcomed. The ridiculed clumsy hunter and clumsy hunting dog in "Little Rabbit Dance" and the four toy people in "Doll Dance" have created very vivid and profound artistic images, both rich in character characteristics and full of humor and creativity.
    The colorful and beautiful folk costumes play an important role in the formation of the national style and folk color of this song and dance group. They are colorful and expressive components of folk traditional art, which can display the customs and culture of a nation. In the performance, the more than ten sets of distinctive, colorful, and exquisitely crafted folk costumes of the chorus, dance troupe, and orchestra added infinite interest to the evening and expressed the Bulgarian women's love for labor and exquisite craftsmanship.
    The visiting performance of the Bulgarian National Folk Song and Dance Ensemble has enhanced our deep friendship and understanding with the Bulgarian people. The group's rich artistic experience in collecting and sorting out folk art and improving performance levels is also very helpful to us. We sincerely congratulate the success of the song and dance troupe's performance! (Attached picture)

    从歌舞中享受民间节日的欢乐
    ——看保加利亚国家民间歌舞团演出	　叶林
    看了保加利亚国家民间歌舞团的演出以后，我深切地感到，保加利亚的民间歌舞，正如这个国家的举世知名的玫瑰花一样的美丽，散发着浓郁的民族艺术的芬芳。
    保加利亚国家民间歌舞团是各国人民所熟知的有名的民间歌舞团之一。这个团体在保加利亚人民艺术家菲利浦·库捷夫领导之下，在收集、整理加工保加利亚民间歌曲、舞蹈和音乐艺术方面做了许多卓越的工作，把保加利亚民间艺术的精华力图集中和保存下来，有着优异的成绩。这个团体给人印象最深刻的是它的完整而情意隽永的民间艺术风格。演出的节目虽然都经过了细致的整理加工，但却毫无刀斧痕迹，使原来流传在人民各种生活场合中的民间歌舞，显得更加完美和精炼，风格更加纯净和鲜明。它的成员也和一般歌舞团体不同，他们全都是从历次民间歌舞比赛中挑选出来的具有丰富艺术经验的有才能的农村民间艺术家。他们和出自专门学校的演员有很大差别，长期在人民群众当中生活，在民间艺术的熏陶中成长，因此，无论一举手一投足，都带来了民间艺术的独特的气息。在艺术创造上，他们按着舞台演出的需要，把保加利亚民间艺术的各种因素，包括全国各地的民间歌曲、音乐、舞蹈、刺绣、服饰以及其它民间工艺美术都融汇于一炉，铸出了一幅又一幅的保加利亚民间歌舞的风俗画。它的色彩是如此的强烈，在舞台上，似乎不是在演出，而是呈现出一处又一处的保加利亚的纯朴的农村景象，让你生活在其中，和他们在一起享受那充满着乡土气息的民间佳节的欢乐。
    在演出中，令人最难忘怀的是那具有高度艺术水平的民间合唱。这个团的合唱队是全部由来自农村的女歌手组成的。她们在民间唱法的基础上，按着合唱艺术的要求，经过了严格的训练，既保存了保加利亚民间唱法的各种特有的技巧，同时又具有非常纯净、温暖的音色，高度灵敏的音准观念和节奏感，创造出了极为难得的民间风格的多声部无伴奏女声合唱艺术。
    菲利浦·库捷夫的几首民间风格的无伴奏合唱歌曲，是十分动人的。它们像民歌一样地具有纯朴的音调，深沉的感情，在不算很宽的音域和平静的节奏中却蕴藏着发自心坎里的热情。当合唱队在唱着“人们唱着歌劳动、为和平幸福斗争，他们保卫自己的祖国，不怕任何侵略战争”的时候，我们从坚定的节奏和宏亮的音调中感觉到的是人民保卫世界和平、打击帝国主义侵略的坚定的信念。在《送别》和《维达呵，漂亮的维达》这两首爱情歌曲中，都同样表达了保加利亚人民对于保卫社会主义祖国的战士的无限爱戴，用最大的信任和最真挚的感情来歌颂他们。
    在民间歌曲的演唱中，领唱者、重唱者的特殊唱法充分表现了保加利亚民歌的具有丰富装饰性乐句的特点和语言的特点，合唱部分的长低音、同度、八度、五度的处理方法也为合唱增加了特殊的色彩。三重唱《准备上路》和小合唱《集合起来》都表现了保加利亚人民反抗法西斯和异族侵略的光荣历史。在一些滑稽歌曲和比较活跃热烈的民间歌曲中，则又反映了保加利亚人民生活的风趣，同时又发挥了合唱队的另一方面的特长，整齐的节奏和准确的音调，即使在最快的速度中也能做到像一个人唱的一样。
    歌舞团的民间舞蹈有很强烈的乡村色彩。每一个不同地区的舞蹈都各有特点，同时又有相互联系的一致的地方。作为共同特征的是它们不强调运用手部的动作而致力于发展腿部的步法，这些步法轻快、活跃而富于弹性，有许多巧妙的变化和复杂的技巧，充分体现出这个民族的乐观的性格和智慧。其中的《洛其?查舞》、《剪葡萄藤》、《绍波地区组舞》、《玛戈顿组舞》等，都是十分精彩的。两个滑稽舞蹈《小兔子舞》和《洋娃娃舞》也受到了热烈的欢迎。《小兔子舞》中的那个备受讽刺的蹩脚的猎人和蹩脚的猎狗，《洋娃娃》中的四个玩具人，都创造了十分生动和深刻的艺术形象，既富于性格的特征，又富有风趣和创造性。
    色彩缤纷的优美的民间服饰，对这个歌舞团体的民族风格和民间色彩的形成，有着重要的作用。它们是民间传统艺术中富于色彩和富于表现力的组成部分，能够显示出一个民族的习俗和文化。在演出中，合唱队、舞蹈队和乐队的十多套各具特色的色彩强烈、工艺精巧的民间服饰，为晚会增加了无限情趣，表现了保加利亚妇女对劳动的热爱和精细的手艺。
    保加利亚国家民间歌舞团的访问演出，增进了我们对保加利亚人民的深厚的友谊和了解。歌舞团在收集整理民间艺术与提高表现水平方面的丰富的艺术经验，对我们也很有帮助。我们衷心地祝贺歌舞团演出的成功！（附图片）
