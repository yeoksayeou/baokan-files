    Strengthening Technical Transformation of Mine Transportation
    The Liangjiagezhe Mining Plant in Jiexiu County, Shanxi Province, is vigorously carrying out technical transformation of ore transportation. By August 21, it had completed a 1,000-ton ore storage, 2.5 kilometers of light rail, and a 620-meter railway spur line. These three projects have been put into production, enabling mechanization and semi-mechanization of the entire production process of mining, transporting, and loading ore, greatly improving work efficiency. The entire mine saved more than 300 workers, over 130 horse-drawn carts, and more than 500 livestock, which were put into the agricultural front.

    Uninterrupted Furnace Operation for Over 400 Days
    The Mao Yi Iron Plant in Xinhua County, Hunan Province, has a small blast furnace of 4.25 cubic meters that uses white coal as fuel and has not stopped for major repairs for 450 days. The experience of this small blast furnace's longevity is mainly: ensuring a fixed supply of raw materials and fuel; meticulously selecting raw materials and fuel from the work area to the furnace, ensuring that dust, powder, impurities, and raw ore do not enter the furnace; strictly weighing the furnace charge and accurately loading it; strengthening testing; stabilizing slag alkalinity; emptying and cleaning the furnace; rotating the four slag and iron tapping holes; and concentrating efforts to deal with problems as soon as they arise.

    Transforming Indigenous Coking Methods
    Workers on the coking front in Huainan City have comprehensively carried out technical transformation of indigenous coking methods in order to produce more and better coke to meet the needs of the steel industry. In coal washing, most of the coking plants in the city have adopted the long-flume coal washing method; in coking, most of the coke ovens in the city have reformed the flues and adopted advanced technologies such as multi-flue layering, which greatly increased coke production and quality. By August 20, 78 percent of the annual state plan had been completed, an increase of 23 percent over the same period last year, with coke ash content reduced by 0.94 percent and sulfur content reduced by 0.09 percent compared to last year.

    Timely Solving New Problems
    The Steel Branch of the Chengdu Measuring Tool and Cutting Tool Factory, in response to new problems and contradictions such as the lack of places to pour molten steel and the inability of material transportation to keep up with production after a substantial increase in production, has vigorously grasped technical innovation and technical revolution. Leading cadres and technicians have all gone deep into the weak links, working with workers to identify problems, investigate causes, and find ways to innovate, and formulate innovation plans. For example, the steelmaking workshop identified a total of sixteen innovation projects from the cupola furnace, converter, and electric furnace to casting, including seven innovation projects to ensure high yields from cupola-type pig iron furnaces. This not only accelerated the pace of the technical revolution, but also promoted a more extensive and in-depth development of the increase production and practice economy movement.

    Mobile Office Visits to the Grassroots
    The Industrial and Transportation Department of the Gu Yuan Special District of the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region has implemented the "Two-Two-Four-Seven System" (visiting one county every half month, spending two days learning, two days working in the office, four days working at a selected spot, and seven days inspecting work) to go deep into the grassroots of each county and conduct mobile office visits. After arriving at the grassroots, they adopted the method of "decentralized work at selected spots, touring inspections, and collective office work" to inspect and guide work, both effectively helping the grassroots solve specific problems and guiding the overall situation through working at selected spots.

    Early Transfer of Coal for Winter Use
    The commercial departments of Heilongjiang Province, based on the characteristics of the province's long heating period and large coal consumption, have made early arrangements for coal for heating this winter and next spring. In order to make early arrangements for people's heating coal for the winter, commercial departments in various places have worked closely with production and transportation departments, adopting the method of simultaneously grasping state-allocated supplies and local supplies, and combining water and land transportation, to vigorously grasp the purchase and transfer of civilian winter coal. From July to now, more than 980,000 tons of coal have been transported in, and the coal inventory of commercial departments throughout the province at the end of July increased by about 20 percent compared with the same period last year.

    要闻快报
    加强矿山运输技术改造
    山西省介休县梁家圪?采矿厂，大搞矿石运输技术改造。到八月二十一日，已建成千吨矿库、二点五公里的轻便铁路和六百二十米长的铁路支线，这三项工程已经投入生产，使采矿、运矿、装车整个生产过程，实现了机械化和半机械化，大大提高了工作效率。全矿节约出三百多名工人、一百三十多辆马车和五百多头牲畜，投入了农业战线。
    四百多天不停炉
    湖南省新化县毛易铁厂，有一座四点二五立方米的小高炉，用白煤作燃料，四百五十天没有停炉大修。这座小高炉长寿的经验主要是：固定原料燃料对口供应；从垱头到入炉道道工序精选原料燃料，保证灰尘粉末、杂质、生矿砂等不入炉；炉料严格过秤，准量入炉；加强化验；稳定炉渣碱度；炉子烧空掏净；四个渣铁口轮流出铁出渣；炉子一出毛病，集中力量，突击处理。
    改造土法炼焦
    准南市炼焦战线职工，为了生产又多又好的焦炭，供应钢铁工业的需要，对土法炼焦全面地进行了技术改造。在洗煤方面，全市绝大部分炼焦厂都采取了长流槽洗煤法；在烧炼方面，全市大部分焦炉都改革了火道，采用了分层多火道法等先进技术，因而，焦炭产量、质量大大提高。到八月二十日止，已完成全年国家计划的百分之七十八，比去年同期提高百分之二十三，焦炭灰分比去年降低百分之零点九四，硫分降低百分之零点零九。
    及时解决新问题
    成都量具刃具厂钢铁分厂，针对大幅度增产后出现的钢水没处浇注、上料运输赶不上生产等新问题、新矛盾，大抓技术革新、技术革命。领导干部和技术人员，都深入到薄弱环节，和工人一道摸问题，查原因，找革新途径，制订革新方案。如炼钢车间从化铁炉、转炉、电炉到浇注，共确定了十六项革新项目，其中保证高炉式化铁炉高产的革新项目就有七个。这样，不仅加快了技术革命的步伐，而且促进了增产节约运动更加广泛深入地开展。
    到基层巡回办公
    宁夏回族自治区固原专署工业交通部门，实行“二二四七制”（半月巡回一县，在半月之内，学习两天，办公两天，蹲点四天，检查工作七天），到各县深入基层，巡回办公。到基层以后，又采取“分散蹲点，划片巡回，集体办公”的办法，巡回检查指导工作，既切切实实地帮助基层解决具体问题，又通过蹲点，指导了全面。
    提早调运冬季用煤
    黑龙江省商业部门根据本省取暖期长，用煤量大的特点，提早安排今冬明春取暖用煤。各地商业部门为了提早安排好冬季人民生活取暖用煤，与生产和运输部门密切配合，采取国家调拨货源和地方货源一齐抓，水、陆运输相结合的办法，大抓民用过冬煤的收购、调运工作。从七月份到现在已运进煤炭九十八万多吨，七月末全省商业部门的煤炭库存量比去年同期增加百分之二十左右。
