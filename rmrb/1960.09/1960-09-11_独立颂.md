    Ode to Independence	〔Guinea〕Di'aierli·Mamengdu·Kangdai
    The greatest happiness is health,
    But freedom is just as important.
    Guitar-playing singers,
    Please pause for a moment before playing and singing again.
    Facing the arrival of independence,
    Everyone's heart is bursting with joy;
    I, the wandering poet Mamengdu·Kangdai,
    Have something to say to the people of Guinea!
    Everything has its own time and fortune,
    But opportunity is always equally distributed;
    Guinea knows how to seize the good opportunity,
    And strive for independence to come soon.
    Wandering and drifting
    Sons of Guinea!
    Everyone feels extremely lucky.
    Almighty Allah loves Guinea,
    And blesses us!
    We fully understand
    How eternal the meaning of independence is;
    We fully understand
    How arduous the cause of defending independence is!
    The whole world understands,
    Everyone knows:
    Only by shedding gushing hot blood,
    Experiencing the burning hunger;
    Braving the hail of bullets,
    Can we obtain the fruits of independence.
    Everyone understands,
    Everyone knows:
    The price of national liberation
    Is the lives of millions!
    Except for madmen and lunatics,
    The whole world is paying tribute to Guinea.
    Please don't be jealous!
    Why be jealous of Guinea's newly born independence?
    Foreign reporters who came to Guinea,
    Raised thirty-two questions;＊
    They received firm answers, and also understood
    That our government and National Assembly stand firm and unshakable.
    Guitar-playing friend,
    Please pause for a moment before playing and singing again;
    I, Mamengdu·Kangdai,
    Have something to say to you.
    People of Guinea!
    Regardless of men and women,
    Regardless of old and young;
    We are strongly united,
    Casting a unanimous vote!
    The political struggle has been won,
    Great independence has arrived,
    Unnecessary disputes have vanished like smoke.
    Everyone is working hard,
    In order to eradicate the roots of poverty as soon as possible.
    Work harder, work better and more wonderfully!
    Hoping that those who are studying,
    Study hard, increase wisdom;
    So that our motherland,
    Can get rid of hardship and ignorance as soon as possible.
    May President Touré and his government,
    Always move forward, never retreat!
    For the rights of citizens,
    The representatives once insisted on fighting, never yielding;
    In order to fight for equality with white people,
    Some people even fought to the end, preferring to be shattered jade!
    Ah! Long live the ideal of world harmony!
    For the independence and autonomy of all mankind,
    We must continue to fight, without yielding or being discouraged;
    This is because until now,
    There are still people in the world who have not tasted the beauty of independence!
    Leaders of Guinea,
    Salute to you!
    Government of Guinea,
    I salute you!
    Guitar-playing friend!
    Please stop for a moment.
    My thoughts fly to distant places,
    My heart is heavy.
    My heart is so melancholy,
    Because I think of the dead;
    In the struggle for independence,
    They sacrificed their precious lives.
    They didn't have time to see with their own eyes,
    The beautiful time of independence has arrived.
    People of Guinea!
    Pray, bless the deceased to rest in peace.
    Pour out words of sorrow,
    To these martyrs for the supreme interest.
              〔Translated by Gao Fei〕
    ＊Here refers to the fact that after Guinea declared independence, President Sékou Touré held a press conference to clarify the government's purpose. Reporters from Western countries raised thirty-two provocative questions at the meeting, and President Touré firmly refuted them one by one. ——Translator's note
    The author, Di'aierli·Mamengdu·Kangdai, is a national minstrel loved by the African people. During Guinea's enslavement by French imperialism, he wandered around, singing poems encouraging national revolution. After Guinea's independence, he received care from all sides, his life was guaranteed, his enthusiasm soared, and he created many widely circulated poems.

    独立颂	〔几内亚〕迪埃里·玛蒙杜·康戴
    最大的幸福就是健康，
    自由的重要更是一样。
    弹吉他琴的歌手啊，
    请停一下再弹再唱。
    面对独立的来临，
    人人心花怒放；
    我，流浪诗人玛蒙杜·康戴啊，
    有话要对几内亚人讲！
    任何事物有自己的时运，
    机会却总是一律平等；
    几内亚知道抓住良机，
    争取独立早日来临。
    浪迹天涯、四处飘流的
    几内亚的儿子们啊！
    人人感到无比幸运。
    万能的真主眷爱几内亚，
    赐福给我们！
    我们完全明白，
    独立的意义多么永恒；
    我们完全了解，
    保卫独立的事业多么艰辛！
    全世界都懂得，
    每个人都知道：
    只有流出滚滚热血，
    经历饥火中烧；
    冒过枪林弹雨，
    才能把独立的果实取到。
    谁都懂得，
    谁都知道：
    祖国解放的代价，
    是生命千百万条！
    除了疯子和狂人，
    全世界都在向几内亚致敬。
    请不要妒忌吧！
    为什么要妒忌几内亚独立新生？
    到几内亚来的外国记者们，
    提出了问题三十二条；＊
    他们得到了坚定的回答，也明白了
    我们的政府和国民议会毅然屹立、不可动摇。
    玩吉他的朋友啊，
    请停一下再弹再唱；
    我，玛蒙杜·康戴啊，
    有话要对你讲。
    几内亚人啊！
    不分男和女，
    不分老和少；
    我们坚强团结，
    投出一致的选票！
    政治斗争已经胜利，
    伟大独立已经来到，
    无端争执云散烟消。
    人人都在努力工作，
    为了早日消灭贫困的根苗。
    加油干吧，要工作得更好更妙！
    希望正在学习的人们，
    努力学习，增强智慧；
    好让我们的祖国，
    早早脱离困苦和愚昧。
    但愿杜尔总统和他的政府，
    永远向前，永不后退！
    为了公民的权利，
    代表们曾经坚持斗争、百折不回；
    为了跟白人争平等，
    更有人曾经战斗到底、宁为玉碎！
    啊！世界大同的理想万岁！
    为了全人类的独立自主，
    还要继续战斗，勿屈勿馁；
    这是因为直到现在，
    世上还有人没尝到独立的美妙滋味！
    几内亚的领导者们，
    向你们致敬！
    几内亚政府啊，
    我向你致敬！
    弹吉他的朋友啊！
    请你停一停。
    我的思想飞往远方，
    忧心沉沉。
    我的心意如此忧郁，
    因为想起了死去的人们；
    他们在争取独立的斗争中，
    牺牲了自己宝贵的生命。
    他们没来得及亲眼看到，
    独立的美好时光来临。
    几内亚人啊！
    祈祷吧，祝福死者安宁。
    倾诉忧伤的话语吧，
    向这些为了至高利益殉道的人们。
              〔高飞节译〕
    ＊这里指的是几内亚宣告独立后，塞古·杜尔总统曾举行记者招待会，阐明政府的宗旨。西方国家的记者们在会上提出了三十二个带有挑衅性的问题，杜尔总统一个个地予以坚决的回驳。——译注
    作者迪埃里·玛蒙杜·康戴是位受非洲人民喜爱的民族行吟诗人。在几内亚受法国帝国主义奴役时，他曾四处流浪，吟唱鼓励民族革命的诗歌。几内亚独立后，他受到各方面的关怀，生活有了保障，热情高涨，创作了许多流传极广的诗歌。
