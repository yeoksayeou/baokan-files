The President visited the department store and then walked to the workers' residential area, visiting an ordinary worker's family. The host, Xu Guangfu, and his wife were both workers at the Shanghai Turbine Factory and were not yet home, so Xu Guangfu’s mother-in-law and his three children received the guests. Xu Guangfu's eldest daughter, only five years old, innocently waved her little hand to welcome the guests. President Touré affectionately stroked the children's heads and took photos with the children and the old lady.

    The President said that youth and children are the future of the world and the hope of mankind. 650 million Chinese people are united in the big family of China. This is what China has gained through long-term revolution, fighting against imperialism and feudalism, and with hardship and sacrifice. It is the glory of the Chinese leaders, the glory of the People's Republic of China, and the glory of the Chinese people.
