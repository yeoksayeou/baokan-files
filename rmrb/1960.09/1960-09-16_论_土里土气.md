    On "Being Rustic"	Tang Xiaoding
    Before liberation, landlords and bourgeois gentlemen looked down on peasants, calling them "rustic." The so-called "rustic" was the opposite of "being Westernized." How could "yellow mud legs" compare to bureaucrats, landlords, and fashionable young masters!
    After liberation, the former exploiters dared not call the laborers "rustic." However, there are still a few people who are influenced by the past exploiting classes and still have criticisms of "being rustic." After the establishment of the People's Communes, there was a saying: Production has developed, the family business is big, and things must be done "properly," "generously," and "we can't be so rustic anymore!"
      "Being rustic" and "being Westernized" are the opposition of two lines and two class styles. Those who like "being Westernized" do not cherish manpower, material resources, or financial resources, and are greedy for bigness, quantity, and novelty. They want to build so-called decent guest houses and clubs, and engage in full-time or part-time literary and sports groups... Those who are "rustic" believe that diligence and thrift should be the foundation, production should be the foundation, and we should talk about hard work first and enjoyment later.
    There is a Peacock Commune in Anyue County, Sichuan Province. The name is beautiful, and it seems to belong to the "Westernized" category. No, this commune is able to give people a sense of nobility and mellowness precisely because it is "rustic." The commune has deep ravines, steep slopes, and thin soil. Before liberation, there was a saying in local folk songs: "If you want to eat a meal of white rice, it will only be on the thirtieth day of the twelfth lunar month." Legend has it that even the peacocks on Peacock Mountain had to fly far away to find food. In the few years since liberation, things have gotten better step by step, but there is still a long way to go before fundamentally changing the face of poverty. However, after the establishment of the commune, a small gust of "we can't be rustic" swept through the commune. The commune's Party committee saw that "being rustic" was nothing more than diligence and thrift. So they educated the Party members, educated the cadres, and educated the masses, so that everyone regarded diligence and thrift as noble and glorious. The cadres took the lead in being diligent and thrifty, and the commune members said: "If the cadres can endure hardship and work hard like this, how can we lag behind?" In this way, in the Peacock Commune, the spirit of diligence and thrift was implemented from top to bottom, inside and out, in everything big and small.
    Advocating diligence and thrift is not to make people "content with poverty." An ancient saying goes: "A gentleman is content with poverty." This is deceiving people. "Gentlemen" are not poor, but just want to make the laboring people, who are regarded as "small people," "content with poverty." If the laboring people do not want to freeze to death and starve to death, they cannot be "content with poverty." The poor want revolution, they want to have a heart for getting rich. The so-called "poor people want to have a heart for getting rich" is not like in the old society, fantasizing about climbing from the proletariat to the status of the propertied class, from the laborer to the exploiter, but to work together with one heart and one mind to achieve the great wealth of socialism and communism, to make the great fortune of socialism and communism, for the collective and for the whole people. "Being rustic," then, fosters this kind of heart for getting rich. And even when we reach communism, we will still advocate diligence and thrift, and we will still advocate the "rustic" style of not being particular about "grandeur" and "ostentation."
    "Being rustic" doesn't look like it? What "look" are you talking about? We are using the glorious tradition of diligence, thrift, and hard work of our nation and our Party to declare war on "poverty and blankness," and to show off our power to the old world and the old system. This is the look of the thoroughly revolutionary proletariat!

    论“土里土气”	唐小丁
    解放前，地主阶级和资产阶级老爷们，对庄稼汉看不顺眼，说他们“土里土气”。所谓“土里土气”者，是同“洋里洋气”相对立的。“黄泥巴脚杆”怎能同官僚、地主、摩登阔少相比呢！
    解放后，先前的剥削者不敢说劳动者“土里土气”了。然而，现在还有少数人受了过去剥削阶级的影响，仍有对“土里土气”的非议。办了人民公社，就有一种说法：生产发展了，家大业大，办事要“像个样子”，要“大方”一点，“不能再那么土里土气了！”
      “土里土气”同“洋里洋气”，是两条路线、两种阶级作风的对立。喜欢“洋里洋气”的人，不爱惜人力、物力、财力，贪大，贪多，贪新。要盖所谓像样的招待所、俱乐部，要搞脱产或半脱产的文艺、体育团体……。“土里土气”的人却认为，应该勤俭为本，生产为本，先讲苦战，后讲享福。
    四川省安岳县有个孔雀公社。名字很美，看来会归入“洋里洋气”一类。不，这个公社能够给人以高洁和醇美的印象，正是因为“土里土气”。社里沟深、坡陡、土质瘦薄。解放前，当地民谣里有句话说：“要想吃顿白米饭，除非腊月三十天”，传说孔雀山的孔雀，也不得已远飞寻食去了。解放几年来，光景一步步好了，然而离根本改变穷困面貌，仍差得远。可是公社成立后，社里吹起一小阵“不能土里土气”的歪风。公社党委看到，“土里土气”不是别的，正是勤俭节约。于是教育党员，教育干部，教育群众，人人都以勤俭为高尚，为光荣。干部带头勤俭，社员们说：“干部都能这样吃苦耐劳，我们还能落后么？”就这样，在孔雀公社，上上下下、里里外外、大事小事都贯彻了勤俭的精神。
    提倡勤俭节约，并非要人们“安贫”。古训说：“君子安贫”。这是骗人的。“君子”并不贫，不过是想叫被看作“小人”的劳动人民“安贫”而已。劳动人民如果不愿冻死饿死，是不能“安贫”的。穷人要革命，要长富心。所谓“穷人要长富心”，不是像旧社会里那样，幻想从无产者爬到有产者的地位，从劳动者爬到剥削者的地位去，而是要同心同德，致社会主义、共产主义的大富，发社会主义、共产主义的大财，为集体、为全民。“土里土气”么，就长了这种富心。而即便到了共产主义，我们也仍然要提倡勤俭节约，仍然要提倡不讲究“阔气”和“排场”的“土里土气”作风。
    “土里土气”不像样子么？什么“样子”呢？我们就是以我们民族我们党的克勤克俭、艰苦奋斗的光荣传统，向“一穷二白”宣战，向旧世界旧制度扬威。这就是彻底革命的无产阶级的样子！
