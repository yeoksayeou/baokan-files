　　Little Beauty and the Telephone
　　Peng Bingyu
　　Some time ago, I had just come down from the province, and the countryside was bustling with production. As soon as I left the county town, there were many people coming and going on the road, like shuttles on a loom. Some carried swaying loads on shoulder poles, others carried small canvas travel bags. They held working tools in their hands, such as hoes and sickles. They all wore straw sandals. Each of them stood with chest out and head held high, like soldiers going to the battlefield. If you asked them where they were going, one of them would immediately ask you in return:
　　“What do you think?” Then they would tell you: “Going to the countryside to support production, to the grain front.” I also joined this stream of people, heading towards the Dongfeng People's Commune in Tianmen County.
　　I arrived at the gate of the Commune Party Committee, which was converted from an old Catholic church. In the courtyard, several towering ancient cypress trees, probably a hundred years old, had very thick trunks, taking two people to encircle. The ground was damp, covered with a lot of tender yellow moss. In the middle was a wide lane, and on both sides of the lane were planted various exotic flowers and rare herbs such as hollyhocks, Buddha's hand, and dragon tongue orchids, which had a bit of a quaint flavor.
　　At the end of the lane, a row of neat houses appeared, which was the office location of the commune. In front of the arched doors of the office were hung many signs: "Dongfeng People's Commune Party Committee," "Technical Innovation and Technical Revolution Committee," "Dongfeng People's Commune Militia Division," etc. These signs looked vibrant, telling people that many people were living fervently here. But when you stopped and looked carefully, the door was ajar, and you couldn't hear a sound.
　　I stopped here, thinking: There's probably no one in the house, should I go in, or go back? But when I listened carefully, it seemed like a bell was ringing inside, like the ringing of a telephone.
　　"Who are you looking for? Looking for my dad? He's in the field command post of the Second Production Team of Yonghe Management Area. You can call there to find him. Looking for Uncle Ma? He's gone to the Wangqiao drought resistance experiment site. Are you asking for Auntie Li? She's gone to Wangcun Kindergarten to inspect the work."
　　Huh! Who is this? I was really a bit confused. The door "creaked" open. I saw a little girl sitting on a round bamboo chair, holding a telephone. She was wearing a water-green short-sleeved top, with blue skirt straps crisscrossing her shoulders, two pigtails like ox horns on her head, and a few strands of fine yellow bangs covering her delicate eyebrows, with a red silk scarf tied around her neck. When she saw me coming in, her eyes were looking at me: "Who are you looking for?"
　　I said: "Is there anyone in the office?"
　　She shook her head, but then nodded again.
　　I thought to myself, the little girl is not making a sound, is she shy!
　　Then she spoke, but to the telephone headset: "Oh! Are you the County Party Committee office? Uncle Hu, who are you looking for, what? Looking for my dad? How did you find the office! Yes, he still lives in the field command post."
　　Oh! She was listening to the phone, no wonder she wasn't talking!
　　After answering the phone, the little girl quickly walked towards me, smiling and saying:
　　"Uncle, sit down." As she said this, she brought a chair and poured a bowl of tea from the room, "Uncle, have some tea."
　　I was really thirsty, so I picked up the bowl and gulped it down.
　　"Where are you from, Uncle?"
　　I said: "From the province." She said: "Were you assigned from the university?" I stroked her head and said: "Little girl, how did you know?" She said: "Four people came a few days ago, all like you, wearing graduation commemorative clothes."
　　Just as we were chatting enthusiastically, the phone rang again. The little girl hurriedly left me and climbed onto the small round bamboo chair again, facing the telephone, listening quietly, and telling the other party the location where Uncle and Dad were working.
　　I sat down, fanning myself with my straw hat, and the heat on my body was reduced by half. There was no sound from the telephone. The little girl put down the headset, walked to my side, and quickly took out a white rabbit handkerchief from her pocket and said: "Uncle, wipe your sweat." I said: "No need." She said again: "Uncle, haven't you eaten yet? I'll bring you a bowl of noodles from the cafeteria. You've suffered on the road, rest at home for a couple of days."
　　Hearing the little girl's kind and innocent words, I quickly picked her up in my arms. I said: "Little girl, how old are you, why haven't you gone to school?" She quickly stretched out a left hand, and then stretched out two fingers on her right hand. I knew she was seven years old. She said again: "These days, the countryside is busy with production, and the teachers have all gone to the fields to work, and school will start in a few days." I said: "Why don't you go outside and play?" She tilted her head and said: "Uncles and aunties are all making great leaps forward in the fields, it's embarrassing if I don't do anything myself! All the uncles in the house have gone outside, and if the phone rings, no one will answer it. My classmates and I have organized a volunteer call answering group. When someone calls, we tell them the location where the uncles and aunties are working."
　　The phone rang again. I quickly put her on the small round bamboo chair. She picked up the headset again, leaned on the telephone table, her eyes fixed on the wall, listening quietly to the other party's questions, and then her eyebrows raised, and a big dimple appeared on her chubby face, reporting the location where the uncles and aunties were working. After reporting, a sweet smile appeared on her face, like getting a five on a test, and being praised by her mother. At this time, I suddenly remembered that I hadn't asked the little girl's name yet. I said: "What's your name?" She tilted her head, touching the red velvet rope on the ox horn braids on her head with both hands: "Li Meili."
　　I thought to myself: What a beautiful name! The girl is as innocent and lively as these two words, as lovable as a little flower.
　　I said: "Is there no one at home in the commune office?"
　　She nodded, "Not at home," then added: "Not in this home."
　　I smiled and said: "Not in this home, where else is there a second home?"
　　She said: "There is, it's called the August fields."
　　"Oh! The August fields!"
　　"Yes! Dad said, August fields are the busiest time, both harvesting rice, planting the fields, and loosening cotton."
　　"The August fields are the busiest time." I repeated her words, quickly put my backpack on my back, and strode towards the door.
　　The little girl said: "Uncle, where are you going?"
　　I said: "Going to find the Party Secretary." Then I turned around and handed her the letter of introduction. She read softly: "To be received by Party Secretary Li Tianpeng." After she finished reading, she smiled and said: "So you want to find my dad, he's in the field command post of the Second Production Team of Yonghe Management Area."
　　I felt surprised in my heart: "You are Secretary Li's little girl!" I quickly picked her up again and kissed her gently on the face twice.
　　I walked away. Little Beauty stood in front of that towering ancient cypress tree and waved to me frequently. I took a few steps and turned around to look at her again.
　　Little Beauty, the telephone, Secretary Li..., what an interesting picture of life! Thinking of this, my heart seemed to have grown a pair of light wings, fluttering towards the August fields.

　　小美丽和电话机
　　彭秉玉
    前些日子，我从省里刚刚下来，乡间生产忙得火热。一出县城，路上来来往往的人很多，像织布机上的梭子一样。有的挑着颤悠悠的担子，有的背着小小的帆布旅行包。手中拿着干活的工具，锄头镰刀之类的东西。脚上穿的尽是草鞋。他们一个个都是挺着胸，昂着头，像上战场的士兵一样。你问他们到哪儿去，他们当中马上有人反问你一句：
  “你说呢？”然后告诉你：“下乡支援生产，到粮食战线上去。”我也夹在这伙人流中，向天门县东风人民公社走去。
    我来到了公社党委会的门口，这是一幢旧的天主堂改建的。庭院中，几株参天的古柏，怕有百来岁的年纪，树杆很粗，两人合抱不下。地面潮湿，长着很多嫩黄的青苔，中间有条宽敞的夹道，夹道两旁种有蜀葵、佛手、龙舌兰等各种奇花异草，很有点古色古香的风味。
    夹道尽头，出现一排整齐的房子，这是公社的办公地点，办公室的拱形门前，挂有很多牌子：“东风人民公社党委会”，“技术革新、技术革命委员会”，“东风人民公社民兵师”等。这些牌子看去生气蓬勃，它告诉人们，有很多人在这儿沸腾地生活着。但当你站下仔细一看，门虚掩着，听不到一点儿声音。
    我走到这儿停住了脚，心里想：屋里大概没有人，是进去，还是往回走？但当我仔细谛听时，里面像有铃声响着，好像是电话的铃声。
      “你找哪个？找我爸爸？在永和管理区二生产队田间指挥棚里。你打电话到那里去找他吧。找马叔叔？王桥办抗旱试验点去了。你问李婶婶吗？到王村幼儿园检查工作去了。”
    咦！这是谁？我真有点儿摸不着头脑，门“呀”的一声推开了。只见一个小姑娘，坐在一把圆竹椅上，手里抱着电话机。她穿着一件水绿色的短袖上装，蓝色的裙带十字交叉搭在肩上，头上顶着两根像牛角一样的发辫，几根细黄的刘海，遮着那双秀丽的眉毛，胸前结着红绢子领巾。她看到我进来时，眼睛滴溜溜地望着我：“找谁？”
    我说：“办公室里有人吗？”
    她摇了摇头，可是接着又把头点了一下。
    我心里想，小姑娘总不作声，该不是怕生吧！
    接着她说话了，可是却对着电话的耳机：“呵！你是县委办公室？胡伯伯，你找哪个，什么？找我爸爸？怎么找到办公室里来了！是的，还是住在田间指挥棚里。”
    呵！原来她在听电话，我说她怎么不说话啦！
    接过了电话，小姑娘连忙向我走来，笑着说：
    “叔叔坐。”说着，端来了一把椅子，又到房里倒了一碗茶，“叔叔喝茶。”
    我的口也实在渴了，捧起碗来咕噜咕噜地喝了下去。
      “叔叔哪来的？”
    我说：“从省里。”她说：“是不是大学里分来的？”我用手抚摸着她的头说：“小姑娘，你怎么知道？”她说：“前几天来了四个人，都像叔叔这样，穿着毕业纪念衣服。”
    正说得起劲，电话机又嘀铃铃响了。小姑娘忙撇下我，又爬到那小圆竹椅上，对着电话机，静静地听着，告诉对方叔叔爸爸工作的地点。
    我坐了下来，用草帽一下一下地搧着，身上的暑气减少了一半。电话机里没有声音了，小姑娘放下耳机，走到我的身边，忙从荷包里掏出小白兔手巾说：“叔叔，擦汗。”我说：“不用了。”她又说：“叔叔，还没吃饭吧？我到食堂端碗面来你吃，路上吃苦了，在家休息两天再说。”
    我听了小姑娘亲切而又天真的话语，连忙用双手将她抱了起来。我说：“小姑娘，你几岁了，怎么还没上学？”她很快地伸出了一只左手，右手又伸出了两个指头。我知道她有七岁了。她又说：“这几天乡下生产忙，老师们也都到田里劳动去了，还有几天才开学。”我说：“你怎么不到外面玩？”她把脑壳一歪，说：“叔叔婶婶都在田里大跃进，自己一点事儿没做，多不好意思！屋里叔叔们都到外面去了，电话来了没人接，我和我们班上的同学，组织了个义务接话组，有人打电话来，就告诉他叔叔婶婶们工作的地点。”
    电话铃又嘀铃铃响着。我忙将她放在小圆竹椅上。她又拿上耳机，伏在电话桌上，两只眼睛一动不动地望着墙壁，静静地听着对方的问话，接着眉毛一扬，胖敦敦的脸上露出个大酒窝，报告对方叔叔婶婶们工作的地点。报告完了，她的脸上现出甜蜜的笑容，真像考试得了五分，受到了妈妈的表扬那样。这时，我忽然记起了还没有问小姑娘的名字，我说：“你叫什么名字？”她把脑壳一歪，两只手摸着头上牛角小辫的红绒绳子：“李美丽。”
    我心里想：多好听的名字！姑娘真像这两个字一样天真活泼，像一朵小花一样受人喜爱。
    我说：“公社办公室一个人也不在家吗？”
    她把头点了点：“不在家，”接着又补充道：“不在这个家。”
    我笑着说：“不在这个家，哪里还有第二个家？”
    她说：“还有，名字叫做八月的田野。”
      “呵！八月的田野！”
        “嗯！爸爸说的，八月的田野是最忙的时候，又是割谷子，又是种地，还要松棉花。”
      “八月的田野，是最忙的时候。”我重复她的话，忙把背包一背，大踏步向门外走去。
    小姑娘说：“叔叔，你到哪儿去？”
    我说：“找党委书记去。”接着转来把介绍信交给了她。她轻轻地念道：“交党委书记李田鹏收。”她念完了，笑着说：“原来你要找我的爸爸，他在永和管理区二生产队田间指挥棚。”
    我听了心里感到惊喜：“你就是李书记的小姑娘！”我又忙将她抱起，在她脸上轻轻地吻了两下。
    我走远了。小美丽站在那株参天古柏前向我频频挥手。我走几步又回过头来向她望望。
    小美丽，电话机，李书记……，多么有意思的生活图画！想到这里，我的心像长了一双轻灵的羽翼，忽闪忽闪地向八月的田野飞去。
