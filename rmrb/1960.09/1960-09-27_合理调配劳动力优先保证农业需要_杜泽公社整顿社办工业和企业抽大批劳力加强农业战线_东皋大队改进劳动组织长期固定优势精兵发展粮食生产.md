　　Rationally Allocate Labor Force, Prioritizing Agricultural Needs
　　Duze Commune Reorganizes Commune-Run Industry and Enterprises, Draws Large Numbers of Laborers to Strengthen the Agricultural Front
　　Donggao Brigade Improves Labor Organization, Permanently Fixing Superior Elite Troops to Develop Grain Production
　　(Our dispatch from Hangzhou, 26th) The Duze People's Commune in Qu County, Zhejiang Province, through a comprehensive reorganization of commune-run industries and enterprises, has drawn 54% of its strong labor force from these industries and enterprises to strengthen the agricultural front. As a result, the labor force engaged in the agricultural production front line has risen to 86% of the total labor force of the commune, effectively strengthening the current field production and promoting the preparations for the "Three Autumns" [autumn harvesting, autumn plowing, and autumn sowing].
　　Since the Great Leap Forward, the Duze Commune has successively established eighteen factories including farm tool factories, chemical fertilizer factories, coal ash factories, paper mills, brick and tile factories, bamboo and woodware factories, food factories, and clothing factories. At the same time, it has established agricultural enterprises such as farms, forest farms, livestock farms, fish hatcheries, and bee farms. Due to the rapid development of commune-run industries and enterprises, a large number of laborers were drawn from the agricultural front, weakening the strength of the agricultural production front line.
　　Not long ago, the Commune Party Committee, in accordance with the spirit of the Party Central Committee's call to vigorously develop agriculture and grain production, conducted a thorough review of the commune's labor force utilization. Based on the new situation where the area of autumn grain crops this year has increased by more than 28,000 mu compared to last year, and the commune needs to add more than 4,000 laborers, the Commune Party Committee decided that, in addition to vigorously carrying out tool reforms to improve labor efficiency, it would comprehensively reorganize commune-run industries and enterprises, and draw labor to strengthen the production front line.
　　After the labor force drawn from the commune-run industries and enterprises was strengthened on the agricultural production front line, the labor force on the agricultural production front line increased from 70.6% to 86% of the total labor force of the commune, greatly promoting high-standard and high-quality field management. The commune completed the summer harvest and summer planting tasks three to five days earlier than last year; the double-cropping late rice exceeded the planned planting area by 60%, an increase of more than double compared to last year. Currently, the commune is carrying out a high-standard, high-quality field management campaign for late autumn crops. All late rice in the commune has undergone three cultivations, weeding, fertilization, and pest control, with an average application of more than 30 dan of standard fertilizer per mu, more than any previous year. High-yield crops such as autumn sweet potatoes and autumn corn have also generally undergone more than two weeding, fertilization, and vine turning management, and are growing well. In terms of "Three Autumns" preparation work, the production teams have made specific and detailed arrangements in terms of labor, tool repair and manufacturing, striving for a quick and good harvest. The planned area for winter crops has been finalized after extensive discussions among the masses, and the area for spring flowering crops in the commune has more than doubled compared to last year.
　　At the same time, after the reorganization, the enthusiasm of the staff and workers in the commune-run industries is even higher. They are vigorously carrying out technological innovations, and labor productivity is continuously improving, and production is achieving sustained leaps forward. The total industrial output value of the commune in August increased by 7.3% compared to July. The production of factories directly related to agricultural production is developing even faster. The total output value of the farm tool machinery factory in August increased by 18% compared to July, and labor productivity increased by 18.5%.
　　(Our dispatch from Changsha, 26th) The Donggao Brigade of Meixian Commune in Pingjiang County, Hunan Province, after concentrating its labor force on agricultural production, has adopted the method of fixing the labor force for grain production according to a certain proportion, while organizing a mobile team to ensure the overall leap forward of agriculture with grain as the key link.
　　This brigade is located in a hilly area, with relatively complex production projects. The proportion of economic crops and forestry and sideline production is relatively large. For many years, there has been a phenomenon of various productions competing with grain for labor within agricultural production. The brigade has 250 mu of tea and more than 130 mu of ramie. The tea picking and ramie harvesting seasons in the three seasons of the year must be carried out simultaneously with the spring planting, summer harvesting and summer planting, and autumn harvesting and autumn planting of grain. Historically, there has been a contradiction: "The tea is old when the seedlings are transplanted, and the seedlings are yellow when the tea is picked." Since the spring plowing this year, the brigade's general branch has implemented the policy of taking grain as the key link, and has paid attention to the rational allocation of labor within agriculture, especially emphasizing strengthening the front line of grain production. They seriously summarized the experience and lessons of previous years and analyzed that there are two main reasons for the scattered labor force in grain production in the past: one is that the division of labor within agriculture is not clear, and the labor force for grain production and economic crops is mixed together, resulting in frequent labor transfers; the other is that agricultural production itself, in addition to grain production as the main task, also has some shock production tasks that must be completed, such as the rush harvesting of economic crops and grain delivery, etc. In the past, without arranging a mobile labor force, it was necessary to temporarily draw labor from grain production. Therefore, in the specific arrangement of labor this year, first of all, the work team labor team is equipped according to the requirements of intensive farming of paddy fields, so that the labor force of the work team accounts for 75% of the total labor force, of which male full labor accounts for 80% of the entire full labor force. Secondly, the proportion of labor occupied by other undertakings is also stipulated. After making specific arrangements for the internal labor force of agriculture, in terms of labor management, in addition to consolidating 75% of the labor force to the work team for a long time to engage in grain production, the brigade also controls a mobile team of 62 people to cope with various shock tasks. More than half a year of experience has proved that the superiority of this labor organization is very great.
　　First of all, it guarantees the labor needs of grain production. Since the beginning of this year, the brigade has not made much changes in general, except for the transfer and replacement of a very small number of laborers from the work team, so that each work team can often maintain about 30 laborers. In this way, it not only meets the labor needs of intensive farming, but also facilitates the establishment of a relatively sound production responsibility system for the work team, so that the quality of cultivation and technical measures can be carried out to the end.
　　Secondly, it fundamentally solves the contradiction between other productions and grain competing for labor. When encountering a shock task, it is no longer necessary to draw labor from the grain front.
　　Thirdly, the brigade controls the mobile labor force, which facilitates adjustment within agriculture and ensures that agricultural production can achieve an overall leap forward with grain as the key link.
　　For more than half a year, due to the adherence to concentrating superior forces to focus on the grain front, the Donggao Brigade has initially achieved a victory of taking grain as the key link and comprehensively leaping forward in various productions. The total output of early rice this year increased by 10% compared to last year; the area of spring and summer sown grain increased by 30% compared to the same period last year; the number of pigs increased by 1.3 times compared to the number of pigs at the end of last year; the sideline business has recovered 30,000 yuan, an increase of 13% compared to the whole year last year; other economic crops, forestry, and fishery have also greatly increased. Currently, the cadres and masses of the entire brigade are continuing to vigorously carry out late-stage management of autumn fields, striving to win a better year.

　　合理调配劳动力优先保证农业需要
　  杜泽公社整顿社办工业和企业抽大批劳力加强农业战线
    东皋大队改进劳动组织长期固定优势精兵发展粮食生产
    本报杭州26日电　浙江省衢县杜泽人民公社通过全面整顿社办工业、企业，从社办工业、企业中抽调出54％的精壮劳力，加强农业战线，因而使全社用于农业生产第一线的劳力，上升到占全社劳力总数86％，有力地加强了当前的田间生产和促进了“三秋”准备工作。
    大跃进以来，杜泽公社陆续办起了农具厂、化工厂、煤灰厂、造纸厂、砖瓦厂、竹木器厂、食品厂、被服厂等十八个工厂，同时办起了农场、林场、畜牧场、鱼种场、蜂场等农业企业。由于社办工业、企业发展快，从农业战线上抽调大批劳力，就削弱了农业生产第一线的力量。
    不久前，公社党委根据党中央大办农业大办粮食的精神，对全社劳力使用情况进行了摸底排队。公社党委根据今年秋季粮食作物面积比去年扩大二万八千多亩，全社需要增加四千多个劳动力的新情况，决定除了大搞工具改革，提高劳动工效，同时全面整顿社办工业、企业，抽调劳力加强生产第一线。
    从社办工业、企业中抽调出来的劳动力，加强了农业生产第一线后，农业生产第一线的劳力由占全社劳力总数70.6％增加到86％，大大促进了高标准高质量的田间管理。全社比去年提早三至五天完成夏收夏种任务；双季晚稻超额60％完成了种植面积计划，比去年增加了一倍以上。目前全社开展了晚秋作物的高标准、高质量田间管理运动，全社晚稻都进行了三次耘田薅草、施肥和治虫，每亩平均已施下三十多担标准肥，比过去任何一年都多。秋番薯、秋玉米等高产作物也普遍进行了两次以上的锄草、施肥、翻藤等培育管理，生长良好。在“三秋”准备工作方面，各生产队从劳力、工具整修制造等方面都作了具体细致的安排，力争快收收好。冬种作物面积计划，经过群众广泛讨论以后已经落实，全社春花作物面积比去年扩大了一倍多。
    同时，社办工业经过整顿以后，职工的劳动积极性更高，大搞技术革新，劳动生产率不断提高，生产获得持续跃进。全社工业总产值8月份比7月份增长7.3％，与农业生产直接有关系的工厂生产发展更快，农具机械厂总产值8月份比7月份提高18％，劳动生产率提高18.5％。
    本报长沙26日电　湖南省平江县梅仙公社东皋大队，把劳力集中到农业生产上来以后，采取按比例固定生产粮食的劳动力，同时组织机动队的办法，保证农业以粮为纲全面跃进。
    这个大队是丘陵地区，生产项目比较复杂，经济作物、林副业生产占的比重较大，历年来农业生产内部就存在各项生产与粮食争夺劳力的现象。全大队二百五十亩茶叶，一百三十多亩苎麻，一年三季采茶与打麻时间，都要和粮食的春播、夏收夏播、秋收秋播同时进行，历史上就有“插得秧来茶又老，采得茶来秧又黄”的矛盾。今年春耕以来大队总支贯彻以粮为纲的方针，注意了农业内部合理安排劳力，特别强调加强粮食生产第一线。他们认真总结历年经验教训，分析过去分散粮食生产劳力的原因主要有两个：一个是农业内部分工不明确，粮食生产与经济作物的劳力混合一起，造成劳力调动频繁；另一个是由于农业本身除了粮食生产为主以外，还有一些突击性生产任务也必须完成，如经济作物突击收割，送粮等等。过去在没有安排机动劳力的情况下，便不得不临时抽调粮食生产劳力。因此，今年在劳力具体安排时，首先，根据水田精耕细作的要求配齐作业组劳力班子，使作业组的劳力占总劳力的75％，其中男全劳力占整个全劳力的80％。其次，也规定其他各项事业占用劳力比例。作好农业内部劳动力具体安排后，在劳动管理上除了把75％的劳力长期巩固到作业组搞粮食生产外，大队还掌握一支六十二人的机动队，应付各种突击任务。半年多来的经验证明，这种劳动组织的优越性很大。
    首先是保证了粮食生产的劳力需要。今年以来，大队除了从作业组抽调和抽换极个别劳力以外，一般都没有多大变动，使每个作业组经常保持有三十个左右劳力。这样，不仅满足了精耕细作的劳动需要，而且便于作业组建立一套比较健全的生产责任制，使耕作质量和技术措施一竿子到底。
    其次，从根本上解决了其他生产与粮食争劳力的矛盾。遇到突击任务，再不要从粮食战线抽劳力。
    第三，大队掌握了机动劳力，便于在农业内部进行调剂，保证了农业生产能以粮为纲全面跃进。
    东皋大队半年多来，由于坚持集中优势兵力主攻粮食战线，目前已初步取得了以粮为纲，各项生产全面跃进的胜利。今年早稻总产量比去年增产一成；春夏播粮食面积比去年同期增加30％；生猪比去年年底存栏数增加一点三倍；副业已收回三万元，比去年全年还增加13％；其他经济作物、林业、渔业也都大大增长。目前全大队干部和群众正继续大搞秋田后期管理，为夺取一个更好的年成而奋斗。
