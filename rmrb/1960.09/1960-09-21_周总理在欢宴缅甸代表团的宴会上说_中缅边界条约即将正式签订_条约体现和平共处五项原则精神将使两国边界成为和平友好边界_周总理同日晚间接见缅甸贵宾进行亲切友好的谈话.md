Xinhua News Agency, 20th: Premier Zhou Enlai held a banquet in the Xinjiang Hall of the Great Hall of the People this evening to warmly welcome the Burmese delegation led by Brigadier General Aung Gyi, Deputy Chief of Staff of the Burmese National Defense Forces, who attended the fourth meeting of the Sino-Burmese Joint Boundary Committee.
　　Vice Premier Chen Yi of the State Council, Vice Premier of the State Council and Chief of General Staff of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, General Luo Ruiqing, Vice Chairmen of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, Guo Moruo and Cheng Qian, attended the banquet.
　　The Burmese Ambassador to China and Burmese representative to the Sino-Burmese Joint Boundary Committee, U Kyaw Winn, attended the banquet.
　　Premier Zhou Enlai spoke at the banquet, warmly welcoming Burmese friends to Beijing for the second time to discuss the signing of the Sino-Burmese Boundary Treaty.
　　Premier Zhou Enlai said that the Burmese delegation of the Sino-Burmese Joint Boundary Committee, headed by Brigadier General Aung Gyi, and the Chinese delegation have held three meetings in a very short period of time, and the fourth meeting is now underway. It can be said that the tasks stipulated in the Sino-Burmese Boundary Agreement have been basically completed. The two sides are now drafting the boundary treaty. It is believed that the draft can be finalized in the next few days so that the Sino-Burmese Boundary Treaty can be formally signed in Beijing by the Prime Ministers of China and Burma during our National Day celebrations.
　　Premier Zhou Enlai said that this treaty will be the first boundary treaty signed by two Asian countries on the basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence and the Bandung spirit, and in the spirit of mutual understanding and mutual accommodation. The signing of the Sino-Burmese Boundary Treaty will make the border between the two countries a border of peace and friendship, and further develop the friendly relations between the two countries and the traditional, kinship-like friendship between the two peoples.
　　Premier Zhou Enlai said that soon Prime Minister U Nu, General Ne Win, and a Burmese delegation of more than 300 people from all walks of life will come to Beijing to participate in our National Day celebrations, and the Sino-Burmese Boundary Treaty will be formally signed at this joyous moment, which will bring Sino-Burmese friendship to a peak.
　　Premier Zhou Enlai thanked Brigadier General Aung Gyi and the delegation he led, as well as all the Burmese personnel who conducted surveys and logistics work on the border, for their arduous efforts in demarcating the Sino-Burmese border.
　　In his speech, Brigadier General Aung Gyi expressed his gratitude to the Chinese hosts for their warm welcome and hospitality. He said that the work of our Sino-Burmese Joint Boundary Committee has been going on for eighty-four days today. During this period, with the joint efforts of our Chinese friends, we are solving the difficult boundary issues left over from ancient times between our two countries. In carrying out this arduous task, we are holding up a treasure umbrella with incomparable power, and this treasure umbrella is the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence and the Bandung spirit that can be recorded in history. We have specifically adhered to these principles, so that we can complete the arduous journey of solving the Sino-Burmese border issue in a very short period of time.
　　Brigadier General Aung Gyi said that the phrase "Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence" is a sentence that we never tire of speaking at any time and any place. In the case of the widespread use of words such as missiles and rockets, it is the bell of peace.
　　Brigadier General Aung Gyi said that the work carried out by the Sino-Burmese Joint Boundary Committee in accordance with the wishes of the people and leaders of the two countries is part of the great palace of building lasting friendship between China and Burma.
　　Brigadier General Aung Gyi finally said that the Chinese people are happily preparing to celebrate their National Day. On this auspicious day, we will contribute all our wisdom and strength to the signing of the Sino-Burmese Boundary Treaty.
　　The Chinese and Burmese people attending the banquet welcomed the warm and friendly speeches of Premier Zhou Enlai and Brigadier General Aung Gyi with warm applause.

    周恩来总理说，以昂季准将为首的中缅边界联合委员会缅甸代表团同中国方面的代表团，在很短的期间内，已经举行了三次会议，现在正在进行第四次会议。中缅边界协定规定的各项任务，可以说已经基本完成。现在双方正在起草边界条约。相信最近几天可以把草案拟定，使中缅边界条约能在我国国庆期间，在北京由中缅两国总理正式签订。
    周恩来总理说，这个条约将是两个亚洲国家第一次在和平共处五项原则和万隆精神的基础上，并且根据互谅互让的精神所签订的边界条约。中缅边界条约的签订将使两国的边界成为一条和平友好的边界，并且使两国的友好关系和两国人民传统的、亲戚般的友谊进一步发展。

    昂季准将在讲话中向中国主人对他们的热烈欢迎和款待表示感谢。他说，我们中缅边界联合委员会进行的工作，到今天已经有八十四天了。在这期间，我们和中国的朋友们在共同努力下，解决着我们两国自古遗留下来的难以解决的边界问题。在进行这个艰巨的工作中，我们撑着具有无比威力的宝伞，这个宝伞就是可以载入史册的和平共处五项原则和万隆精神。我们具体奉行了这些原则，使我们能在很短时间内将要走完解决中缅边界问题的艰巨路程。
    昂季准将说，和平共处五项原则这个言词是我们在任何时间，任何地方都讲不腻的一句话，这句话在普遍使用导弹、火箭这些言词的情况下，它就是和平的钟声。
    昂季准将说，中缅边界联合委员会根据中缅两国人民和两国领导人的愿望所进行的工作，是建筑中缅两国持久友谊的、伟大宫殿的一部分。
    昂季准将最后说，中国人民正在兴高彩烈地准备庆祝自己的国庆佳节，在这个吉祥的日子里，我们将为签订中缅边界条约，贡献我们的一切智慧和力量。
