Xinhua News Agency, Havana, September 28th: Cuban Prime Minister Castro and other members of the Cuban delegation, who attended the United Nations General Assembly, returned to Cuba from New York this evening. They were warmly welcomed at the Havana airport by President Dorticós, Minister of the Revolutionary Armed Forces Raúl Castro, Governor of the National Bank of Cuba Guevara, other senior government officials, leaders of the Rebel Army, and thousands of people.

A grand mass rally was held in the square in front of the Presidential Palace to welcome Prime Minister Castro. When Castro appeared on the balcony of the Presidential Palace, the crowd waved tens of thousands of handkerchiefs and Cuban flags to pay him respect, and shouted slogans such as "Cuba yes, Yankees no!", "Down with U.S. Imperialism!" and "Long live the Cuban Revolution!" in unison.

Prime Minister Castro addressed the crowd, saying that Cuba is fighting against U.S. imperialism to win its own liberation and sovereignty. He warned that in this struggle, U.S. imperialism will never rest, nor will it admit defeat in its stubborn conspiracy to destroy the Cuban Revolution and prevent Cuba's progress. He emphasized that "Imperialism hates us like a master hates a rebellious slave. There is no hatred more brutal than the master's hatred for a rebellious slave." Castro condemned that Cuba's enemies are the most brutal, bellicose and arrogant. Because the example of the Cuban Revolution threatens the interests of imperialism around the world, imperialism attempts to destroy the Cuban Revolution to prevent the people of other countries from learning from Cuba. He said that this struggle will be long-term and arduous, but final victory is certain. Castro emphasized that the Cuban people should not only oppose aggressors and defend themselves, but also redouble their efforts to make the country continue to move forward. He said that the Cuban revolution wins support not with words, but with facts.

During Prime Minister Castro's speech, two demolition charges exploded. But not a single person in the crowd moved from their position. Castro praised the courage and composure of the crowd, and pointed out that these explosions were instigated by U.S. imperialism with money. He said that every explosion by the enemy will promote Cuba to organize more cooperatives, carry out more nationalizations, and further arm the militia. He called on the people to establish a revolutionary guard system, and establish guard committees in every neighborhood to monitor all activities of counter-revolutionary agents. He also said that new steps will be taken in the construction of the militia, and militia battalions will be organized throughout the country.

Castro also protested the cruel suppression suffered by Cuban patriots residing in the United States. He said that these Cubans were forced to go abroad to find work during the period of tyranny. When the Cuban delegation was in New York, they were brutally beaten by the New York police. He said that batons are a symbol of American "super freedom" and "super democracy."

Xinhua News Agency, September 29th: New York dispatch: Cuban Prime Minister Castro, who led the Cuban delegation to the 15th session of the United Nations General Assembly, returned home yesterday on a plane provided by the Soviet Union.

Before taking off, Castro pointed out to reporters: He took a Soviet plane back home because the U.S. authorities confiscated all Cuban planes that arrived in New York.

Castro said that he would come to the United Nations again soon. During Castro's absence, the Cuban delegation will be led by Cuban Foreign Minister Roa.

    卡斯特罗离纽约回国后在哈瓦那群众集会上讲话
    古巴人民爱国斗争肯定能最后胜利
    号召建立镇压反革命活动的警卫组织　宣布将在全国组织民兵营
    新华社哈瓦那28日电　出席联合国大会的古巴总理卡斯特罗和古巴代表团的其他成员今天晚上从纽约回到古巴。他们在哈瓦那的机场上受到多尔蒂科斯总统、革命武装部部长劳尔·卡斯特罗、古巴国家银行行长格瓦拉和政府其他高级官员、起义军首脑以及数千群众的热烈欢迎。
    在总统府前面的广场上举行了盛大的群众集会来欢迎卡斯特罗总理。当卡斯特罗在总统府的阳台上出现时，群众挥动着成千上万的手帕和古巴国旗向他表示敬意，并且同声高呼“要古巴，不要美国佬！”、“打倒美帝国主义！”和“古巴革命万岁！”等口号。
    卡斯特罗总理向到会群众讲话时说，古巴为了争取自己的解放和主权正在与美帝国主义进行着斗争。他警告说，在这场斗争中美帝国主义绝不会休息，也不会在它企图摧毁古巴革命和阻止古巴进步的顽固阴谋中认输。他强调指出，“帝国主义就像主人仇恨反叛的奴隶一样仇恨我们。没有比主人对奴隶反叛的仇恨更加残暴的了。”卡斯特罗谴责说，古巴的敌人是最残暴好战和最狂妄的。由于古巴革命的范例威胁着帝国主义在世界各地的利益，帝国主义就企图摧毁古巴革命，来制止其他各国的人民学习古巴的榜样。他说，这场斗争将是长期的和艰巨的，但是，最后的胜利是肯定的。卡斯特罗强调指出，古巴人民不仅应该反对侵略者，保卫自己，而且应该加倍努力，使国家继续前进。他说，古巴革命不是用言词，而是用事实赢得支持的。
    在卡斯特罗总理讲话时，发生了两枚爆破筒爆炸的事件。但是到会群众没有一个人从自己的位置上动一下。卡斯特罗赞扬了到会群众的勇敢和镇静，并且指出，这些爆炸事件是由美帝国主义出钱指使的。他说，敌人的每一次爆炸都将促进古巴组织更多的合作社，进行更多的国有化和更进一步地把民兵武装起来。他号召人民建立革命的警卫体系，在每一个街区建立警卫委员会来监视反革命特务的一切活动。他还说，在民兵建设工作上将采取新的步骤，在全国将组织民兵营。
    卡斯特罗还对侨居在美国的古巴爱国者所受到的残酷压制表示抗议。他说，这些古巴人是在暴政时期被迫到国外去寻找工作的。当古巴代表团在纽约的时候，他们受到纽约警察的粗暴的殴打。他说，警棍是美国的“超级自由”和“超级民主”的象征。
    新华社29日讯　纽约消息：率领古巴代表团出席联合国大会第十五届会议的古巴总理卡斯特罗昨天乘苏联提供的飞机回国。
    卡斯特罗在起飞前向记者们指出：他乘苏联飞机回国，是因为美国当局没收了到达纽约的所有古巴飞机。
    卡斯特罗表示，他不久以后还要到联合国来。在卡斯特罗回国期间，古巴代表团将由古巴外交部长罗亚率领。
