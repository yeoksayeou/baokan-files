Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 18th: The following statement by the spokesperson of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam regarding the current situation in Laos was released here today:
	Following the coup d'état in Laos on August 9, 1960, the new Lao government, headed by Prince Souvanna Phouma, announced its intention to pursue a policy of genuine peaceful neutrality, to respect the Geneva Accords, and to strengthen friendly relations with neighboring countries and all countries willing to establish good relations with Laos. The Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam announced its welcome to this foreign policy of the Kingdom of Laos. The Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam believes that such a foreign policy will help stabilize the situation in Laos and contribute to consolidating peace in Indochina and Southeast Asia, in line with the interests and aspirations of the Lao people and the people of all countries in the region.
	The domestic and foreign policies pursued by the Souvanna Phouma government represent a defeat for U.S. imperialism, which has long interfered in Laos, undermined the Geneva Accords, and attempted to turn Laos into a U.S. military base.
	Therefore, U.S. imperialism is doing everything possible to obstruct Laos from following the path of peaceful neutrality and national harmony, and is creating tensions in Laos. U.S. imperialists are blatantly instigating and supporting their lackeys, General Phoumi Nosavan and Prince Boun Oum, in their efforts to carry out activities against the legitimate government, in order to realize their sinister schemes. Under the direction of U.S. imperialism, South Vietnam and some countries of the Southeast Asia aggressive bloc have already made pronouncements and taken actions to interfere in Laos. Recently, the United States has dispatched units of the Seventh Fleet to operate in the South China Sea near the Indochinese Peninsula.
	Clearly, the conspiracy being carried out by U.S. imperialism is making the situation in Laos and Indochina very dangerous. In order to cover up their crimes and deceive public opinion, U.S. imperialism and its lackeys have fabricated baseless facts to slander the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, such as the so-called "Viet Minh troops" "conducting activities" in Vientiane and other places in Laos.
	In the face of the serious situation described above, the spokesperson of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam is authorized to issue the following statement:
	As a party to the Geneva Accords and a neighbor of Laos, the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam strongly opposes the blatant and dangerous acts of interference in Laos by U.S. imperialism and its satellite countries, which violate the Geneva Accords and threaten peace in Indochina and the security of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. U.S. imperialism and the satellite countries of the United States must bear full responsibility for their actions of interference in Laos.

Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 17th: The Vietnamese "People's Daily" pointed out today in a commentary entitled "Resolutely Oppose U.S. Imperialist Provocations Against Laos," that U.S. imperialism, resentful that the Lao government headed by Prince Souvanna Phouma is striving to pursue a policy of peaceful neutrality and national harmony in accordance with the wishes of the Lao people, is vigorously interfering in Laos' internal affairs and creating tension in Laos.
	The U.S. State Department issued a statement openly supporting the Phoumi Nosavan traitorous group in establishing a so-called "Revolutionary Committee" headed by Boun Oum Na Champassak, in order to split Laos and create civil war in Laos. Subsequently, the U.S. imperialist aggressors dispatched an aircraft carrier, several warships, and a battalion of U.S. Marines to conduct military "exercises" in the South China Sea. Facts prove that U.S. imperialism is using force to threaten the Lao people and the Kingdom of Laos government headed by Prince Souvanna Phouma.
	The commentary condemned U.S. imperialism for fabricating the lie of "the Democratic Republic of Vietnam invading Laos" as a pretext for further interference in Laos, and then pointed out that U.S. imperialism is increasingly exposing its true colors as the enemy of the Lao people, and that the purpose of their actions is clearly to support the Phoumi Nosavan rebel group, which has been expelled from the cabinet by the Lao government. It is noteworthy that U.S. imperialist actions are coordinated with the activities of its lackey in Thailand, who are stepping up their encirclement and sabotage of the Lao economy. The Thai Prime Minister is also urging the Southeast Asia aggressive bloc to quickly intervene in Laos.
	The commentary said that the actions of U.S. imperialism and its lackeys in interfering in Laos' internal affairs and creating tension in Laos not only seriously threaten the independence, unity, and security of Laos, but also seriously threaten peace in Indochina and Southeast Asia, which is a blatant provocation against the freedom-loving and peace-loving people of all countries in the region. People have once again clearly seen that U.S. imperialists, although repeatedly suffering disastrous defeats, are still unwilling to abandon their policy of violence aimed at suppressing the national independence movements of the people of Asia and the world.
	The commentary concluded by saying that the Lao people's anti-U.S. patriotic movement and the movement to support the Phouma government and oppose the Phoumi Nosavan rebel group are developing more and more vigorously. The Lao people and the Asian people will never allow the U.S. imperialist bloc to turn Laos into a hotbed of war.

### 越南外交部就老挝当前局势发表声明  美帝国主义干涉老挝威胁和平  越“人民报”谴责美国公开支持诺萨万集团叛国活动

    越南外交部就老挝当前局势发表声明
    美帝国主义干涉老挝威胁和平
    越“人民报”谴责美国公开支持诺萨万集团叛国活动
    新华社河内18日电　此间今天公布了越南民主共和国政府外交部发言人今天就老挝当前局势发表的声明，全文如下：
    1960年8月9日在老挝发生政变之后，以梭发那·富马亲王为首的老挝新政府曾经宣布实现真正的和平中立政策，尊重日内瓦协议，加强同邻国以及愿意同老挝建立良好关系的所有国家的友好关系。越南民主共和国政府曾经宣布欢迎老挝王国政府这个外交政策。越南民主共和国政府认为这样的外交政策将有助于使老挝局势稳定下来，并为巩固印度支那和东南亚的和平作出贡献，符合老挝人民和这个地区各国人民的利益和愿望。
    梭发那·富马政府执行的对内和对外政策是长久以来干涉老挝、破坏日内瓦协议并企图把老挝变为美国的军事基地的美帝国主义的一个失败。
    因此，美帝国主义正在千方百计阻挠老挝走向和平中立、民族和睦的道路，在老挝制造紧张局势。美帝国主义者明目张胆地唆使和支持它的走狗——富米·诺萨万少将和文翁亲王竭力进行反对合法政府的活动，以实现他们的不可告人的阴谋，在美帝国主义的指使下，南越和东南亚侵略集团的一些国家已经发表和进行干涉老挝的言论和行动。最近美国又派遣第七舰队的一些单位到印度支那半岛附近的南中国海进行活动。
    很显然，美帝国主义正在进行的阴谋使老挝和印度支那局势变得非常危险。为了掩盖它们的罪行和欺骗舆论，美帝国主义及其走狗捏造了毫无根据的事实来诬蔑越南民主共和国，例如所谓“越盟军队”在万象和老挝其他地方“进行活动”的问题。
    面对上述严重局势，越南民主共和国政府外交部发言人受权发表声明如下：
    作为签订日内瓦协议的一方和老挝的邻邦，越南民主共和国政府极力反对美帝国主义和它的附庸国家对老挝的明目张胆和危险的干涉行动，这些行动违反日内瓦协议，威胁印度支那的和平、威胁越南民主共和国的安全。美帝国主义和美国的附庸国家必须对它们干涉老挝的行动负完全责任。
    新华社河内17日电　越南“人民报”今天在一篇题为“坚决反对美帝国主义对老挝的挑衅行为”的评论中指出，美帝国主义由于对以梭发那·富马亲王为首的老挝政府正在根据老挝人民的愿望努力奉行和平中立和民族和睦的政策怀恨在心，正在大力干涉老挝内政和制造老挝紧张局势。
    美国国务院曾经发表声明，公开支持富米·诺萨万叛国集团成立以文翁·纳占巴塞为首的所谓“革命委员会”，以分裂老挝和制造老挝内战，随后美帝国主义侵略者又派遣一艘航空母舰、多艘军舰和美国海军陆战队的一个营到东海南面进行军事“演习”。事实证明，美帝国主义正在用武力威胁老挝人民和以梭发那·富马亲王为首的老挝王国政府。
    评论谴责美帝国主义捏造所谓“越南民主共和国侵略老挝”的谎言来作为更深入地干涉老挝的借口以后指出，美帝国主义日益暴露它是老挝人民的敌人的真相，它们的行动的目的，很显然是要支持已经被老挝政府开除出内阁的富米·诺萨万叛乱集团。值得注意的是，美帝国主义的行动同它在泰国的走狗加紧包围和破坏老挝经济的活动是互相配合的。泰国总理还催促东南亚侵略集团赶快干涉老挝。
    评论说，美帝国主义及其走狗干涉老挝内政和制造老挝紧张局势的行动，不仅严重地威胁了老挝的独立、统一和安全，而且还严重地威胁了印度支那和东南亚的和平，这是对这个地区爱好自由和和平的各国人民的一种明目张胆的挑衅。人们再一次看清了美帝国主义者虽然多次遭受惨败，但仍然不肯放弃企图镇压亚洲和世界各国人民的民族独立运动的暴力政策。
    评论最后说，但是，老挝人民的反美救国运动和支持富马政府、反对富米·诺萨万叛乱集团的运动正在日加猛烈地发展。老挝人民和亚洲人民决不让美帝国主义集团把老挝变成一个战争温床。
