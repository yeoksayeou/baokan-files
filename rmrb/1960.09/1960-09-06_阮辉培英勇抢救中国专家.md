    Nguyen Huy Boi Heroically Rescues Chinese Expert

    Recently, in the Gu Dinh chromite mine area of ​​northern Vietnam, the heroic deeds of Labor Party member Nguyen Huy Boi, who risked his life to rescue a Chinese expert, have been widely circulated.

    The story goes like this: One day, a Chinese expert working at the mine site went to the factory to move wooden boards. As he was bending down to pull the boards, a pile of large wooden boards above slowly began to collapse. At this critical moment, Nguyen Huy Boi, who was passing by, noticed and immediately rushed in, disregarding his own safety, and forcefully pushed the Chinese expert away. However, the large pile of wooden boards heavily pressed down on Nguyen Huy Boi, causing him to bleed from the mouth and lose consciousness. The cadres and workers at the site immediately rushed over upon hearing the news and sent Nguyen Huy Boi to the hospital for emergency treatment. In this way, Nguyen Huy Boi heroically rescued the Chinese comrade who was in mortal danger.

    Although Nguyen Huy Boi was seriously injured, he gradually recovered his health under the careful treatment and care of the doctors. Afterwards, someone asked Nguyen Huy Boi, "What were you thinking when you rescued the Chinese comrade?" He shook his head and smiled, saying, "At that time, I only thought that if a comrade was in trouble, he should be rescued. Later, when I learned that the Chinese expert was safe, I felt extremely relieved. The Chinese comrades have come to our country to help with construction, despite their hardships. I could not stand by and watch his life be in danger."

    Nguyen Huy Boi is just over twenty years old this year and is a member of the Vietnamese Labor Party with four years of party membership. Ten years ago, he wandered the streets with his mother, begging for a living. The revolution gave him a new life and gradually grew into an excellent proletarian fighter. In his work, he is always conscientious and responsible, working hard, and has been repeatedly named a labor model, activist, and model party member. Currently, Nguyen Huy Boi is the secretary of the Youth League branch at the construction site. The young people in his labor group come from different provinces, and because he takes the lead in his work and cares for his comrades, he has won the love and trust of the group members. His labor group took the lead in implementing the contract system at the construction site, and then the entire construction site implemented this system. His group also frequently wins the mobile red flag in the construction site's labor competitions.

    Nguyen Huy Boi's act of risking his life to rescue a Chinese comrade not only demonstrates the noble qualities of this young Labor Party member, but also shines with the lofty spirit of internationalism and the brotherly friendship between the Vietnamese and Chinese people.

    阮辉培英勇抢救中国专家
    最近，在越南北部古定铬铁矿矿区，劳动党党员阮辉培冒着生命危险抢救中国专家的英勇事迹，到处被人传颂着。
    事情的经过是这样的：有一天，在矿区工地帮助工作的中国专家到厂里去搬运木板，当他正低头拉木板时，上面的一堆大木板却在慢慢地塌下来了。就在这千钧一发之际，阮辉培路过发现，马上奋不顾身地飞冲进去，用力把中国专家推开。但是，那一大堆木板重重地压在阮辉培的身上，把他打得口冒鲜血，昏迷不醒。工地的干部和工人闻讯立刻赶来，把阮辉培送到医院急救，阮辉培就这样英勇地搭救了有生命危险的中国同志。
    阮辉培虽然伤势严重，但在大夫们的精心治疗和护理下，逐渐恢复了健康。事后有人问阮辉培：“当你抢救中国同志时，你想到的是什么？”他摇摇头微笑着说：“当时，我只想到同志遇难就应该抢救。事后当我知道那位中国专家平安无事时，心里欣慰异常。中国同志不辞劳苦来我国帮助建设，我决不能眼看他生命垂危而退缩”。
    阮辉培今年刚二十岁出头，是一个有四年党龄的越南劳动党党员。十年前，他跟着母亲流浪街头，乞讨度日。革命使他开始了新的生活，并且逐渐成长为一个无产阶级的优秀战士。在工作中，他总是认真负责，埋头苦干，因而多次被评为劳动模范、积极分子和模范党员。现在，阮辉培是工地的青年团支部书记。他领导的劳动小组的青年来自不同省份，由于他工作带头，并且爱护同志，因而赢得了组员的爱戴和信任。他的劳动小组在工地首先带头实行包工制度，接着全工地都实现了这种制度。他的小组也经常获得工地劳动竞赛的流动红旗。
    阮辉培冒着生命危险抢救中国同志的行为，不仅表现了这位年青的劳动党员的高贵品质，而且还闪耀着崇高的国际主义精神和越中两国人民兄弟般友谊的光辉。
