To Dr. Johannes Dieckmann, Chairman of the Presidium of the People's Chamber of the German Democratic Republic:

	I was deeply saddened to learn of the unfortunate passing of Comrade Wilhelm Pieck, President of the German Democratic Republic.
	Comrade Wilhelm Pieck was not only an outstanding son of the German working class and working people, but also a prominent activist in the international workers' movement and a loyal friend of the Chinese people. With extreme sorrow, on behalf of the entire Chinese people and the state, and in my own name, I express my heartfelt condolences to you and, through you, to all the people of the German Democratic Republic.
	At this sorrowful moment, the Chinese people, with boundless love and remembrance for Comrade Wilhelm Pieck, will resolutely join the people of the German Democratic Republic in striving to strengthen the fraternal friendship between the Chinese and German peoples, to strengthen the solidarity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, and to build socialism and defend world peace.

　　Liu Shaoqi, Chairman of the People's Republic of China, September 8, 1960, Beijing
