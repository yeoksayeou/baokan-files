	Manganese-Iron Smelting Small Blast Furnace Longevity Model
	The No. 1 eight-cubic-meter small blast furnace of Guangzhou Xinhua Steel Plant, which smelts manganese-iron, has been in continuous production for 600 days since it was put into operation on December 3, 1958. At present, the furnace type and furnace body structure of this blast furnace are still intact, and production is normal. The average daily output since the beginning of this year has increased many times compared with the same period last year, and the quality of manganese-iron produced meets the requirements. The Guangdong Provincial Department of Metallurgical Industry and the Guangdong Provincial Heavy Industry Trade Union recently awarded the workers of this furnace the certificate of "Manganese-Iron Smelting Small Blast Furnace Longevity Model".

	Coking Oven with Fast Coking and Low Coal Consumption
	Liu Shaowu and other workers of the Dujiang Coal Mine in Wenjiang Special District, Sichuan, recently created a "Renovation No. 2" coke oven. Production practice has proved that this coke oven has more advantages than the Pingxiang oven. Fast coking time: the coking cycle is six days shorter than the Pingxiang oven, with an average of 45 tons of coke produced per person per month, which is six times more than the Pingxiang oven; high quality: with the same refined coal, the ash content of the Pingxiang oven is 28.3%, while this oven is 24.8%; low cost: the cost of refining one ton of coke in the Pingxiang oven is 2.9 yuan, while the "Renovation No. 2" oven is 0.67 yuan. At the same time, after the first ignition of this oven, the flames and gas emitted from the previous batch of refined coal when it becomes coke are used to directly burn the next batch of refined coal, so that the coal loading and coke discharging cycle is continuous, so there is no need for people to burn the fire again. In addition, because its shape is like an arch bridge, it is not afraid of rainstorms. Wenjiang Special District has fully promoted this kiln shape, and coke production is increasing substantially.

	Shuangqiao Coal Mine Develops at High Speed
	Guangfeng Shuangqiao Coal Mine in Jiangxi Province implements the policy of "running mines diligently and thriftily, and supporting mines with mines", and closely combines production and capital construction from beginning to end, using production to support capital construction and capital construction to ensure production. When transforming the main shaft, it uses the auxiliary shaft for production, builds large shafts while simultaneously building small shafts, and also establishes its own satellite factories for bricks, tiles, lime, and machinery to solve raw material problems. In this way, from last year to now, without asking the state for a penny, it has developed from a seasonal coal mine with a daily output of only five or six tons to a regular coal mine with a daily output of about 100 tons. Since the beginning of this year, this mine has shifted from producing mainly daily-use coal to producing mainly coking coal, and has successively built six pairs of regular coal wells.

	All Walks of Life Support Small Coal Mines
	All walks of life in Beibei District, Chongqing, support the technical transformation of small coal mines in terms of mechanical equipment, raw materials, transportation tools, and labor. Due to the strong support from all aspects, the small coal mines in the district have realized battery lighting and rail transportation, and the degree of mechanization has been further improved. From the beginning of this year to the present, the raw coal produced in the district has been close to the total output of last year, and coke has exceeded the total output of last year.

	Saving Good Coal for Steelmaking
	The employees of the steam-powered ships along the Yangtze River, which are under the jurisdiction of the Yangtze River Navigation Administration, under the slogan of "'Pioneer' does not eat 'Marshal' grain, good coal is reserved for steelmaking," actively familiarize themselves with the performance of new coal types (inferior coal), improve operating techniques, and increase the proportion of mixed burning of inferior coal. According to incomplete statistics from January to July this year, ships on the entire line saved more than 45,000 tons of good coal without affecting transportation efficiency.

    要闻快报
    冶炼锰铁小高炉长寿标兵
    广州市新华钢铁厂一号八立米冶炼锰铁的小高炉自一九五八年十二月三日开炉生产以来，已连续生产了六百天。目前这座高炉的炉型和炉体结构仍很完整，生产正常。今年以来的平均日产量更比去年同期成倍提高，所产锰铁质量合乎要求。广东省冶金工业厅、广东省重工业工会，最近特授予这座炉子的职工以“冶炼锰铁小高炉长寿标兵”的奖状。
    结焦快用煤少的炼焦窑
    四川温江专区都江煤矿工人刘绍武等，最近创造了一种“革新二号”焦窑。经过生产实践证明，这种焦窑比萍乡窑有更多的优点。结焦时间快：炼焦周期比萍乡窑缩短六天，平均每人每月产焦四十五吨，比萍乡窑增长六倍；质量高：同样的精煤，萍乡窑灰分为百分之二十八点三，这种窑为二十四点八；成本低：萍乡窑每炼一吨焦费用二点九元，“革新二号”窑为零点六七元。同时，这种窑从第一次点火后，利用成焦时间的不同，使前一批精煤成焦时喷发的火焰和煤气直接燃烧后一批精煤，使装煤、出焦循环不已，这样就再也不用人烧火了。另外，由于它的外形是拱桥状，所以不怕暴雨袭击。温江专区已经全面推广了这种窑形，焦炭生产正在大幅度增长。
    双桥煤矿高速度发展
    江西广丰双桥煤矿贯彻“勤俭办矿、以矿养矿”的方针，自始至终把生产和基建紧密地结合起来，以生产养基建，以基建保生产。在改造主井时，利用副井生产，建设大井时，同时增建小井，并且自办砖瓦、石灰、机械等卫星工厂，解决原材料问题。这样，从去年到现在，没向国家要一文钱，就由一个原来日产只有五、六吨的季节性煤矿，发展成为一个日产百吨左右的正规煤矿。今年以来，这个矿已由生产日用煤为主转入以生产主焦煤为主，并且先后兴建了六对正规煤井。
    各行各业支援小煤窑
    重庆北碚区各行各业从机械设备、原料、材料、运输工具和劳动力等各方面支援小煤窑技术改造。由于各方面的大力支援，所以全区的小煤窑已实现电瓶照明和轨道运输，机械化程度进一步提高。从今年年初到目前为止，全区生产的原煤已接近去年全年产量，焦炭已超过去年全年总产量。
    节约好煤去炼钢
    长江航运管理局所属长江全线各蒸汽机船舶职工，在“‘先行（官）’不吃‘元帅’粮，好煤留下去炼钢”的口号下，积极熟悉新煤种（劣质煤）的性能，改进操作技术，增大配烧劣质煤的比重。据今年一至七月份不完全统计，全线船舶在不影响运输效率的情况下，节约了好煤四万五千多吨。
