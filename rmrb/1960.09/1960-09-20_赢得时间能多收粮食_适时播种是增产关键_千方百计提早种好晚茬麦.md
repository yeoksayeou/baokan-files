Xinhua News Agency, Lanzhou Telegram　To plant returning wheat in a timely manner, the CPC Pingliang Prefectural Committee in Gansu Province promptly organized cadres and the masses to summarize a complete set of specific measures and actively promote them throughout the district. Now, people's communes everywhere are actively preparing for wheat planting in accordance with this set of methods.

Winter wheat planted after the harvest of autumn crops is called returning wheat. This crop of wheat is generally cultivated and planted later than the regular crop (after the wheat harvest, the land is left fallow and winter wheat is planted in autumn, which is called the regular crop). The land's fertility is also consumed by the autumn crops, so the increase in production is generally not as high as that of the regular crop fields. To strive for wheat yields to catch up with the regular crop, the CPC Pingliang Prefectural Committee instructed all communes to strengthen the management of autumn fields as early as possible, using methods such as more hoeing, more fertilization, more watering, and increasing the application of heat-generating fertilizers to enhance land fertility and promote early autumn maturity to ensure early wheat planting. In mid-August, the Prefectural Committee dispatched working groups to Ning County, Pingliang City and other places with experience in planting returning wheat to summarize experience and guide the overall work. The Prefectural Committee's working group organized cadres, experienced farmers, and technicians for repeated discussions, and summarized eight measures to ensure early and good planting of returning wheat: 1. In accordance with the principle of adapting to local conditions, allow the planting of regular wheat to proceed first, in order to concentrate labor during the autumn harvest to rush harvest and rush planting; 2. Conduct a general ranking of stubble fields for autumn crops, and select the upper stubble (i.e., stubble with a good fertilizer base, sufficient land fertility, and strong soil fertility), good stubble (i.e., vegetable stubble, corn stubble, etc. that do not consume much land fertility), and early stubble (i.e., early-maturing stubble that is planted early and processed well) to plant returning wheat; 3. Accumulate more good fertilizer, apply sufficient base fertilizer, and transport the fertilizer to the field early; 4. Organize labor, livestock power, and tools well, harvest and cultivate and plant simultaneously; 5. Expand the planting of drought-resistant, cold-resistant, disease-resistant, and early-maturing varieties suitable for local returning wheat, such as blue-flower wheat, grasshopper wheat, money-exchange wheat, and foreign wheat, to adapt to the characteristics of thin land fertility and low soil temperature in returning wheat fields, and implement seed identification and seed dressing with pesticides; 6. Appropriately increase the seeding rate to compensate for the shortcomings of low emergence rate and few tillers in returning wheat; 7. Cultivate finely, deeply, evenly and rake carefully to resist drought, preserve soil moisture, and promote early rooting of wheat seedlings; 8. Assign targets and measures to the land, establish a responsibility system, manage as soon as planting starts, and do a good job in winter raking and winter hoeing, apply warm seedling fertilizer, and protect the wheat over winter.

After this set of methods was summarized, various places organized cadres and the masses to discuss and promote them in accordance with local conditions. Now, many people's communes in various counties (cities) have started planting regular wheat about ten days earlier than in previous years. Most people's communes have selected the stubble fields for returning wheat, and the selection work is actively underway. More than 80% of the autumn planting fertilizer has been prepared in the whole region, and all the fertilizer needed for returning wheat fields has been transported to the field edge.

This newspaper reports According to the Hebei Daily: Begu Village Commune in Ba County, Hebei Province, summarized the experience of increasing production by intercropping wheat in summer potato fields for two years, solved the contradiction between the late harvest period of sweet potatoes and the requirement for early planting of wheat, and decided to intercrop all nearly 10,000 mu of summer potato fields suitable for wheat planting. Now, the whole commune has organized more than 3,000 commune members to start preparing for intercropping wheat in summer potato fields, including turning over seedlings, moving ridges, applying fertilizer, and deep plowing, in combination with the management of summer potatoes.

This commune started intercropping wheat in summer potato fields in 1958. In that year, the first team of Begu Village Production Team in this commune intercropped 30 mu of wheat in the ridges of summer potatoes. Because they planted well and managed carefully, they averaged 380 jin of wheat per mu. When planting in the autumn of 1959, the whole commune promoted this experience and intercropped more than 3,100 mu of wheat in summer potato fields. Although it encountered a severe drought this year, it still averaged 125 jin per mu.

The Commune Party Committee attached great importance to this experience. When formulating the autumn wheat planting plan this autumn, it further summarized this advanced farming experience. The Commune Party Committee believes that this year, there are more late autumn crops in the whole commune than in previous years, and there are more than 24,000 mu of summer potatoes alone. Most of these summer potatoes are planted in good wheat stubble fields with good soil quality, flat land, and water source conditions. Vigorously promoting the farming method of intercropping wheat in summer potato fields is of great significance to ensuring the timely completion of the commune's plan to plant 60,000 mu of wheat. In order to further improve potato and wheat intercropping, the Commune Party Committee launched commune members to hold discussions to summarize the experience of intercropping wheat in summer potato fields, and summarized three major advantages: 1. In the case of many summer stubble crops this year, it can ensure the expansion of wheat planting area; 2. It can turn late stubble into early stubble, and can cultivate carefully, apply base fertilizer to ensure planting quality; 3. Wheat is planted in potato ditches, which is conducive to wind and cold protection, water accumulation and moisture retention, and strong growth of trees before winter and early greening in spring. Back is large, broadcast width is wide, and ventilation and light transmission conditions are good. In addition, the masses also proposed that corn can also be intercropped on the back of wheat in the spring.

Now, except for one management area without intercropping conditions, cadres and experienced farmers in the other thirteen management areas in the whole commune have checked the summer potato fields piece by piece, formulated intercropping measures piece by piece, and implemented the intercropping tasks to the small teams. The whole commune has organized more than 3,000 commune members to start preparing for intercropping, such as turning over seedlings, sending fertilizer, applying fertilizer, and plowing, in combination with the field management of summer potatoes. At present, some production teams have already started planting.

This newspaper reports According to the Henan Daily: Qiulou Commune in the suburbs of Kaifeng City carefully summarized the summer harvest experience over the years, actively prepared for autumn planting, and ensured that wheat was planted sufficiently and well.

Qiulou Commune plans to plant more than 65,000 mu in autumn this year, which is larger than the autumn planting area in previous years. When summarizing the experience and lessons of the summer harvest over the years, the Commune Party Committee believed that every year there is a part of the late stubble wheat, which affects more production increases because the arrangement is not proper. In order to completely solve this contradiction, the Commune Party Committee paid attention to this problem early this year. First Secretary Chen Bin went deep into the teams to conduct investigations slope by slope and piece by piece, and held symposiums with team leaders, technicians, and experienced farmers to seriously study countermeasures. According to the survey, the autumn stubble distribution of the autumn planting area in the whole commune is very complicated. Early stubble only accounts for a little over 10% of the total area; middle stubble accounts for 64% of the total area; late stubble accounts for a little over 25% of the total area. According to the autumn planting season, early stubble and middle stubble can be planted in a timely manner; according to the autumn harvest season in previous years, late stubble is generally around the Frost's Descent period. Due to the late harvest of autumn crops, wheat is planted in a hurry, which affects the harvest in the coming year. Based on this situation, the Commune Party Committee took a series of measures to reverse this situation. The Party Committee surveyed the current growth of late autumn crops piece by piece, and adopted measures to promote early maturity in accordance with local conditions and crops: applied quick-acting fertilizer to sweet potatoes to accelerate growth; adopted the method of applying fertilizer and hitting the edge of the heart on cotton to achieve early peach formation and early fluffing. For late stubble wheat, it is required to concentrate superior forces, plow deeply and rake finely, apply more fertilizer, select Nanda 2419 fine varieties, and densely plant. In this way, by catching up and catching up, the problem of late stubble is solved, and the wheat planting plan is guaranteed to be completed on time.

In the autumn planting preparation, the Qiulou Commune Party Committee also firmly grasped the work of water, fertilizer, and seeds, laying the foundation for striving for increased grain production in the summer of next year. (Attached picture)

    赢得时间能多收粮食  适时播种是增产关键
    千方百计提早种好晚茬麦
    平凉专区实行八条措施保证回茬麦种早种好  别古庄公社万亩薯田套种小麦变晚茬为早茬  仇楼公社采取措施促秋早熟力争晚麦早下种
    据新华社兰州电　为了适时种好回茬麦，中共甘肃平凉地委及时组织干部和群众，总结出成套的具体办法，在全区积极推广。现在，各地人民公社正在按照这套办法，积极进行种麦准备。
    秋收作物收割以后播种的冬小麦，叫作回茬麦。这茬麦子，因比正茬麦（麦收后，土地休闲，秋季再种冬小麦，叫正茬麦）耕得迟、种得迟，地力又经过秋收作物的消耗，一般增产幅度不及正茬麦田高。为了力争小麦产量回茬赶正茬，中共平凉地委早就指示各公社要及早对秋田加强管理，用多锄、多施肥、多浇水和增施热性肥料等办法，增强地力，促秋早熟，保麦早种。8月中旬地委又派出工作组，到宁县、平凉市等过去播种回茬麦有经验的地方总结经验，指导全面。地委工作组组织干部、老农、技术员反复座谈，共总结出八条保证种早、种好回茬麦的措施：一、按照因地制宜的原则，让正茬麦的播种工作先走一步，以便在秋收时集中劳力，抢收抢种；二、对秋田作物普遍进行茬口排队，选出上茬（即施肥基础好，地力足，土壤肥力强的茬口）、好茬（即对地力消耗不大的蔬菜茬、玉米茬等）、早茬（即种得早、加工好的早熟茬）种回茬麦；三、多积好肥，施足底肥，提早把肥料运到地头；四、组织好劳力畜力、工具，随黄随收，边收边耕边种；五、扩大种植当地适于回茬麦的蓝花麦、蚂蚱麦、钱交麦、洋麦等耐旱、耐寒、抗病、早熟品种，以适应回茬麦田地力薄、地温低的特点，并实行种子鉴定，药剂拌种；六、适当加大下籽量，以弥补回茬麦出苗率低、分蘖少的缺点；七、耕细耕深耕平耱绵，抗旱保墒，促使麦苗早扎根；八、指标、措施到地，建立责任制，一种就管，搞好冬耱冬锄，施好暖苗肥，保护小麦过冬。
    这套办法总结出来以后，各地都组织干部、群众进行讨论，因地制宜的推行。现在，各县（市）许多人民公社已比往年提前十天左右开始播种正茬麦。大部分人民公社已经选好了回茬麦的茬口，选种工作正在积极进行。全区秋种肥料已经备妥80％以上，回茬麦田所需要的肥料已统统运到地边。
    本报讯　据河北日报消息：河北省霸县别古庄公社总结两年来夏薯地里套种小麦增产的经验，解决了甘薯收获期晚、小麦要求种早的矛盾，确定把适合种麦的近万亩夏薯地，全部套种上小麦。现在，全社已组织了三千多名社员，结合夏薯管理开始了翻秧腾垅、铺肥、深翻等夏薯地套种小麦的准备工作。
    这个社在夏薯地里套种小麦，是从1958年开始的。当年这个社的别古庄生产队第一小队为了扩大小麦播种面积，在夏薯垅里套种了三十亩小麦，由于种的好，管的细，每亩平均打了三百八十斤小麦。1959年秋种时，全社推广了这一经验，在夏薯地又套种了三千一百多亩小麦，今年虽然遇到了严重干旱，每亩仍平均产了一百二十五斤。
    全社党委十分重视这一经验，在制订今秋种麦规划时，进一步地总结了这一先进耕作经验。公社党委认为，今年，全社晚秋作物比往年多，光夏薯就有二万四千多亩。这些夏薯又多是种在土质好、土地平整、有水源条件的好麦茬地，大力推广夏薯套种小麦的耕作方法，对保证适时完成全社种小麦六万亩的计划有十分重要的意义。公社党委为进一步把薯麦套种搞好，发动社员座谈总结夏薯地套种小麦的经验，归纳出三大优点：一、在今年夏茬作物多的情况下，可以保证扩大种麦面积；二、能使晚茬变早茬，并能精耕细作，施底肥保证播种质量。三、麦子种在薯沟里，有利于防风防寒，积水保墒，冬前棵发壮、开春返青早。背大、播幅宽，通风透光条件好。此外，群众还提出明春在麦背上也可以套种玉米。
    现在，全社除了一个管理区没有套种条件外，其他十三个管理区的干部、老农，逐块检查了夏薯地，逐块订出套种措施，并且把套种任务落实到小队。全社组织了三千多名社员，结合夏薯的田间管理，开始了套种前的翻秧、送肥、施肥、翻地等准备活动。目前，部分生产队已经开耧下种。
    本报讯　据河南日报消息：开封市郊仇楼公社认真总结历年夏收经验，积极作好秋种准备，保证把小麦种足种好。
    仇楼公社今年计划秋播面积为六万五千多亩，比历年来的秋播面积都大。公社党委在总结历年来夏收经验与教训时，认为每年都有一部分晚茬麦，因为安排不够妥善，而影响更多增产。为彻底解决这个矛盾，公社党委今年及早注意了这个问题，第一书记陈彬深入到各队，逐坡、逐块进行调查，并且召开队长、技术员、老农等座谈会，认真研究对策。据调查，全公社秋播面积落实到田的秋茬分布非常复杂。早茬麦只占总面积的10％强；中茬占总面积的64％；晚茬占总面积的25％强。按秋播节令看来，早茬、中茬均可以适时播种；晚茬据往年的秋收季节看，一般在霜降前后，由于秋庄稼收得晚，小麦匆匆播种，使来年收成受到影响。根据这个情况，公社党委采取了一系列的措施，决心扭转这个局面。党委逐块调查了晚秋作物当前的生长情况，因地因作物制宜，采取措施促其早熟：对红薯大追速效肥料，加快生长；对棉花采取下追肥料、上打边心的办法，攻成桃早吐絮。对晚茬麦，要求集中优势兵力，深犁细耙，多施肥料，选用南大2419良种，密植下种。这样上追下赶，就解决了茬口晚的问题，保证小麦播种计划按时完成。
    在秋播准备中，仇楼公社党委还狠狠抓住了水、肥、种籽等项工作，为争取明年夏季粮食增产打下基础。（附图片）
