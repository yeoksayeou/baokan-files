Guanyun Actively Expands the Planting Area of Wheat and Rapeseed

Autumn planting layout quickly implemented in the fields; various preparatory works start half a month early.

(This newspaper) Nanjing, 3rd – The Guanyun County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party has fully mobilized the masses to resolve a series of contradictions and expand the autumn planting area. The county plans to sow 840,000 mu of wheat (including 60,000 mu of wheat intercropped with corn and wheat intercropped with cotton), an increase of 12% over the actual harvested area this year. The planting area of other autumn crops such as broad beans, peas, and rapeseed has also been expanded compared to last year. The autumn planting layout has been quickly implemented in the fields, and various preparatory works have started half a month earlier than last year.

Due to this year's increased land utilization rate in Guanyun County, the replanting area of autumn-harvested crops is large, with much intercropping and overlapping. Therefore, early-season crops have decreased, and late-season crops have increased. Last year, the area of late-season wheat in the county accounted for only 33%, but this year it has expanded to 76.5%. The increase in late-season crops is a contradiction in expanding the autumn planting area. At that time, some people were concerned that more late-season crops would be detrimental to wheat growth next year. In response to this new situation, the county party committee mobilized the masses to discuss how to ensure that "late-season crops are not late, and late wheat catches up with early-season crops before winter." Through discussion, everyone believed that the key to ensuring good growth of late-season wheat and catching up with early-season wheat is to increase the fertilization level of autumn sowing base fertilizer and apply sufficient base fertilizer to every mu. According to this requirement, a large-scale fertilizer accumulation campaign was launched throughout the county. People's communes organized specialized fertilizer accumulation and transportation teams to accumulate large amounts of fertilizer. Currently, the county has accumulated 42,650,000 dan of base fertilizer for autumn planting, averaging 55 dan per mu.

The second contradiction in autumn planting this year is that intercropping of early and late-season crops will affect the progress of autumn plowing. For example, autumn beans are intercropped in early cornfields, and the autumn beans are growing after the corn is harvested. Originally, autumn plowing could be carried out early after the corn harvest, but due to the autumn beans in the field, it is inconvenient to plow. This contradiction has also been resolved after full discussion by the masses. The method is to "divide the whole into parts" and organize manpower to dig the land. In this way, it is possible to flexibly carry out harvesting and digging in the intercropped rows, and carry out autumn plowing as early as possible. According to the principle of "vacate a piece, plow a piece; vacate a furrow, dig a furrow," Nanlun Commune has already harvested more than 10,800 mu of corn in fields with alternating early and late-season crops, and timely organized more than 2,700 laborers to deep-dig 1,100 mu of land in the corn rows. In fields where both upper and lower crops can be harvested simultaneously using cattle power, the role of cattle power is also fully utilized, and 460 cattle have been organized to plow more than 3,500 mu of land.

When arranging the autumn planting area, the communes and production teams promptly paid attention to resolving the contradiction between continuous planting and planting according to local conditions. According to county statistics, about 25% of the good stubble land suitable for wheat planting contradicts continuous planting. The method to resolve this contradiction is: everything is subordinate to increasing production, facilitating agricultural work, and not disrupting the original labor organization of the production team, wheat can also be planted on good stubble land outside the continuous planting area. Yangji Commune's Nongxu Brigade plans to sow 3,184 mu of wheat in autumn, divided into two continuous plots of 1,000 mu each, and two continuous plots of 500 mu each, totaling 2,860 mu, with another 324 mu of early stubble suitable for wheat planting outside the continuous plots. According to the principle of "not losing one mu of good stubble outside the continuous plots, and not leaving interspersed fields of late stubble within the continuous plots," this team adopted the method of intercropping: if the early stubble is within the next year's corn area, the method of wheat intercropped with corn is adopted; if the early stubble is within the next year's cotton area, the method of wheat intercropped with cotton is adopted. This not only achieves active continuous planting but also appropriate continuous planting. The early stubble fields are all planted with wheat, and the continuous planting of spring-sown crops next year is also taken into account. After the county promoted the method of adapting to local conditions and adapting to stubble conditions, all the more than 50,000 mu of early stubble fields outside the continuous plots will be planted with wheat this year.

After resolving these new contradictions and expanding the autumn planting area, Guanyun County has actively started various preparatory works. Many production teams have already started seed selection work in advance, and the autumn planting technical backbone training work directly presided over by the county party committee has also begun. The agricultural secretaries of the commune party committees personally take command, and the committee members divide the areas and are responsible for contracting them, combining the current field management and autumn harvest work to go deep into the team to inspect and specifically help with the autumn planting preparation work.

### 充分发动群众　认真解决矛盾　为明年多收打好基础  灌云积极扩大三麦油菜播种面积

    充分发动群众　认真解决矛盾　为明年多收打好基础
    灌云积极扩大三麦油菜播种面积
    秋种布局迅速落实到田各项准备工作提前半月
    本报南京3日电　中共江苏省灌云县委充分发动群众解决了一系列的矛盾，扩大了秋播面积：全县三麦计划播种八十四万亩（其中麦套玉米、麦套棉花六万亩），较今年实收面积扩大12％，其他如蚕豆、豌豆、油菜等秋播作物面积，都比去年有所扩大。秋种布局很快落实到田头，各项准备工作比去年提前半个月开始。
    灌云县由于今年提高土地利用率，秋收作物复种面积大，间作和套作多。因此，早茬减少，晚茬增多。去年全县晚茬麦面积只占33％，今年扩大到76.5％，晚茬多，这是扩种秋播面积的一个矛盾。当时曾有人顾虑：晚茬多了，对下年麦子生长不利。县委针对这个新的情况，发动群众讨论如何使“晚茬不晚，晚麦生长在冬前就赶上早茬”的问题。通过讨论，大家认为，要使晚茬麦生长良好，赶上早茬麦，主要的关键是提高秋播基肥的施肥水平，亩亩施足基肥。根据这个要求，全县开展了大规模的积肥运动。各人民公社都组织了积肥运肥专业队大量积肥。现在，全县已积秋种基肥四千二百六十五万担，平均每亩有肥五十五担。
    今年秋播第二个矛盾是，早茬晚茬套作在一起，对秋耕的进度会有影响。如早玉米田里夹种秋豆，玉米收了秋豆正在生长；本来玉米收割之后可以提早秋耕，现因秋豆在田里，就不便耕作。这个矛盾经过群众充分讨论也得到了解决。办法是“化整为零”，组织人力挖地。这样就可以灵活地在套作的行子里进行边收边挖，及早秋耕。按照“腾出一块耕一块，腾出一畦挖一畦”的原则，南仑公社在早晚茬相间的田块上，已经收割了一万零八百多亩玉米，及时组织两千七百多个劳动力，在玉米行里深挖土地一千一百亩；在可以使用牛力的上下茬同时收获的田块上，也充分发挥牛力作用，组织四百六十犋耕牛，已经耕好了三千五百多亩地。
    在安排秋播面积的时候，各公社、生产队及时注意解决连片种植和因地种植的矛盾。根据全县的统计，约有25％可以种麦的好茬口地与连片种植有矛盾。解决这个矛盾的方法是：一切服从增产，便利农活，不打乱原来生产小队的劳动组织，在连片之外的好茬口地也可以种麦。杨集公社农旭大队秋播三麦三千一百八十四亩，划成千亩连片两块，五百亩连片两块，计两千八百六十亩，还有三百二十四亩该种麦的早茬在连片之外。根据“连片之外的好茬一亩不丢，连片之内的晚茬不留插花田”的原则，这个队采用了套作的方法：早茬若在明年玉米片内，就采用麦套玉米的方法；早茬若在明年棉花片内，就采用麦套棉花的方法。这样既做到积极连片，又做到适当连片。早茬田既全部种上了麦子，又照顾了明年春播作物的连片。全县推广了因地制宜、因茬口制宜的方法之后，在连片之外的五万多亩早茬田，今年将全部种上麦子。
    灌云县在解决这些新的矛盾扩大秋播面积之后，各项准备工作已经积极着手进行。很多生产小队已经提前进行选种工作，县委直接主持的秋播技术骨干训练工作也已开始。各公社党委农业书记都亲自挂帅，委员分片包干，结合当前的田间管理和秋收工作，深入小队进行秋播准备工作的检查和具体帮助。
