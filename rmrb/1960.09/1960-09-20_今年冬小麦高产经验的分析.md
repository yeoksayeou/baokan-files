    Analysis of High Yield Experience of Winter Wheat This Year	Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Institute of Crop Cultivation and Physiology

    This year's summary of winter wheat high-yield experiences from various regions has improved compared to the past, with a broader scope and richer content. From July 20th to 29th, the Institute of Crop Cultivation and Physiology of the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences held a Winter Wheat High-Yield Technology Research Conference in Zhengzhou, Henan, to exchange experiences in creating large-area high yields and high-quota yields, and to study the technical measures and theoretical basis for yields around 1,000 jin per mu. The following is our preliminary analysis of this year's high-yield experiences of winter wheat.

    	Reasonable Population Structure of High-Yield Fields: The Constituent Factors of High Yield
    This year, many high-quota high-yield wheat fields with yields of around 1,000 jin per mu have emerged across the country. Studying the yield composition of high-yield fields in various regions, we can roughly classify them into the following types: First, for the northern wheat region or northern-type varieties achieving 1,000 jin high yields, the number of spikes per mu is mostly around 650,000, with 20 to 23 grains per spike, and a thousand-grain weight of about 36 grams; Second, for large-spike varieties in the central wheat region achieving 1,000 jin high yields, the number of spikes per mu is mostly around 500,000, with about 30 grains per spike, and a thousand-grain weight between 32 and 38 grams; Third, for large-spike varieties in the southern wheat region achieving 1,000 jin high yields, there are three situations: one is a higher number of spikes per mu, such as the high-yield fields of the Huidong Commune in Liu'an, Anhui, and the Baqiao Commune in Yangzhou, Jiangsu, with about 500,000 spikes per mu, 28 to 30 grains per spike, and a thousand-grain weight of about 33 grams; the second is a smaller number of spikes per mu, but with particularly large spikes, such as the high-yield field of the Sichuan Academy of Agricultural Sciences, which has only 233,000 spikes, but 44.8 grains per spike and a thousand-grain weight of 40 grams; the third is a number of spikes per mu between 360,000 and 400,000, with about 35 grains per spike and a thousand-grain weight of 36 to 40 grams, such as the high-yield field of the Hongqi Commune in Lezhi County, Sichuan. From the analysis of these situations, it can be roughly seen that the yield composition factors of high-yield fields in the north are characterized by a large number of spikes; the number of spikes in high-yield fields in the south is less than in the north, but the number of grains per spike is higher, which is a characteristic of high yield. The central wheat region (including areas south of Shijiazhuang in Hebei Province, as well as Henan, Shandong, and the Guanzhong area of Shaanxi) has a moderate number of spikes per mu, while the number of grains per spike and the thousand-grain weight are higher. The different paths taken by each region to achieve high yields reflect the characteristics of the regional climate and the differences in the yield composition of the adapted variety types. Due to the colder and drier climate in the north, the tillering ability and the number of formed spikes of the varieties are higher, so the adapted number of spikes is higher than in the south; the climate in the south is warmer and more humid, the tillering ability and the number of formed spikes of the varieties are lower, and because they continue to grow in winter, the plants are more lush, and the threat of field shading and lodging is greater, so the adapted number of spikes is less than in the north. This is a factor that should be considered when designing the population structure of high-yield fields.

            Scientific Basis for Reasonable Population Structure of High-Yield Fields
      (1) Guarantee the Maximum Development of the Population.
    Reasonable close planting is the central link to achieving high yields. On the basis of reasonable close planting, through a series of cultivation and management measures that combine promotion and control, while ensuring the maximum development of the population, the individuals are given healthy growth and development, thus unifying the contradiction between the individual and the population, and achieving more spikes, larger spikes, more grains, and fuller grains. Data from high-yield fields in various regions show that the basic seedlings for yields of about 1,000 jin per mu are mostly 200,000 to 400,000, the number of tillers per plant is two to five before winter and four to six after winter, the number of formed spikes per plant is 1.3 to 2, the total number of tillers per mu before winter is mostly 900,000 to 1,100,000, the highest total number of tillers per mu after winter is mostly 1,100,000 to 1,400,000, and the number of formed spikes per mu is mostly between 400,000 and 700,000. These indicators of individual and population structure, whether from the fact of obtaining high yields itself or from the results of density research in various regions, have proven their rationality under the current cultivation level. Many data further point out that in the process of developing towards high-yield fields, reasonable close planting cannot only be understood as increasing the sowing density, but it is also necessary to master the dynamic laws of individual and population growth and development and their coordination; if cultivation and management are improper, even within the reasonable sowing density range, high yields cannot be obtained. The sowing amount in the suburbs of Beijing last autumn was mostly around 30 jin per mu, and the number of basic seedlings was mostly 300,000 to 350,000 plants, but the variation range of the total number of tillers and spikes per mu varied greatly. Those with less than 600,000 to 700,000 tillers before winter and less than 900,000 at the highest number of tillers per mu, it is difficult to reach 500,000 spikes per mu; those with more than 1,100,000 tillers before winter and more than 1,400,000 at the highest number of tillers, most of them were overgrown and lodged, even with a higher number of spikes, but with few and small grains, both of these types had low yields. Among them, there were many wheat fields with yields around 1,000 jin per mu, with generally about 1,000,000 healthy tillers before winter, the highest number of tillers between 1,300,000 and 1,400,000, and a heading rate of up to about 50%, with a number of spikes per mu between 600,000 and 700,000. Since the population is in excellent development conditions throughout the entire growth period, the plant guarantees more spikes, larger spikes, more grains, fuller grains and high yield.

      (2) Give full play to the potential of more spikes, more grains, and larger grains, and coordinate the relationship between the three.
    Under certain cultivation conditions, there is a certain contradictory relationship between the three: more spikes, more grains, and larger grains, that is to say, when the number of spikes per unit area increases, the number of grains per spike tends to decrease, and the grains will also become smaller to a certain extent. However, this relationship is not absolute. When the cultivation level is improved, the contradictory relationship between the three can be further coordinated and unified. This marks the further development of the comprehensive use of the "Eight-Character Charter for Agriculture". From a large number of high-yield examples this year, the number of spikes per mu has broken through the previous limits to varying degrees, and within the range of 400,000 to 700,000 spikes per mu, the number of grains per spike generally reaches more than 24, and many are around 27 to 30, with a maximum of 44.8. The thousand-grain weight is mostly between 30 and 40 grams, and individual ones reach 49.6 grams. On the premise of ensuring that the number of grains per spike or the thousand-grain weight is not significantly reduced, according to our research, the northern wheat region can currently reach 700,000 spikes per mu; the central wheat region can reach 500,000 spikes per mu; and according to a survey by the Jiangsu Branch, the southern wheat region can reach about 400,000 spikes per mu. This year, there are also individual fields in the southern region that have achieved high yields by striving for large spikes and more grains under a smaller number of spikes. From the cultivation conditions in the south, which are more rainy and humid and have a greater threat of lodging, it is easier to achieve high yields by striving for large spikes on the basis of controlling a certain number of spikes.

      (3) Master the dynamic population structure of seedling, plant, spike, and grain growth and development, and improve photosynthetic productivity.
    Within a certain range, striving for more grains and larger grains on the basis of more spikes is the basic way to achieve high yields of 1,000 jin. The main key to achieving this goal is to master the dynamic population structure of seedling, plant, spike, and grain growth and development, and to maximize the use of nutrients and light energy to improve photosynthetic productivity. It involves the determination of basic seedlings and the ebb and flow of tillers and leaf area at various stages, as well as the coordination of plant growth and development in the early and late stages, material accumulation and transformation, and other issues. In the final analysis, it is centered on reasonable close planting, comprehensively using the "Eight-Character Charter for Agriculture", so that wheat can grow and develop reasonably according to human will, so as to obtain high yields.
    When designing the population structure for high yields, the primary problem is to determine the appropriate basic seedlings. From the number of basic seedlings in high-yield fields in various regions this year, although they vary due to different regions, varieties, and cultivation conditions, except for individual examples below 200,000 plants, the rest are within the range of 200,000 to 400,000 plants, and most are between 250,000 and 350,000 plants. From the analysis of density test results in various regions this year, the basic seedling density for obtaining high yields under medium and high fertility conditions is generally also within this range. Under cultivation conditions with particularly high fertility and meticulous management, the adapted density tends to decrease. Under large-area conditions, it is more reliable to obtain high yields by applying more basic seedlings.

    On the basis of reasonable basic seedlings, striving for an appropriate number of healthy tillers is the second link to obtaining high yields. Analyzing this year's data, once again proves that tillered plants are closely related to obtaining large spikes. According to surveys by our institute and the Jiangsu Branch and other units, plants with tillers that form spikes are relatively large and have more grains, even plants with ineffective tillers are stronger than single-stem plants, and are also superior in terms of stem thickness and root development. The Jiangsu Branch used water culture conditions to observe the nutrient turnover, proving that the nutrients absorbed by the root system between the main stem and tillers can be transferred to each other. During the jointing period, the nutrients of normal tillers supply about 38% to the main stem, while the yellowing tillers supply about 40% of the nutrients to the main stem. This information shows that under the conditions of growing appropriate tillers, the increase in permanent roots will also promote the growth of the main stem and large tillers. In addition, the heading rate of tillers in many high-yield fields this year is relatively high, indicating that improving the heading rate of tillers on the premise of controlling a certain number of tillers is an important link for striving for high yields.
    The number of tillers is closely related to the leaf area per mu, and the size of the leaf area in each growth period is related to the use of light energy. Therefore, exploring the leaf area index (the leaf area index is the multiple of the total leaf area to the ground) indicators at various growth stages of wheat, and studying the impact caused by the size of the leaf area is also an important aspect of considering the reasonable population structure.

    The 1,000-jin high-yield field of Henan Agricultural College was achieved under the conditions of 394,000 basic seedlings per mu. The number of tillers per plant reached 2.9 before winter and 3.4 after overwintering, which can be considered to have reached the requirements of strong seedlings. Although the total number of tillers reached 1,149,000 after overwintering, due to the characteristics of the Nanda 2419 variety having rapid thinning of tillers in the middle of the growth period, the number of tillers per mu decreased to 887,000 during the jointing period, so the ventilation and light transmission in the field was still good, the stems grew strongly, the young spikes developed normally, and did not lodge at maturity. According to the research of data from various regions, maintaining the leaf area index at 1.5 to 2 before winter and in the early stage of overwintering can grow into strong seedlings, and maintaining the maximum leaf area index within the range of 6 to 7 after the jointing stage can be considered a reasonable indicator for striving to fully utilize light energy and increase photosynthetic products under the current cultivation conditions.
    Striving for a reasonable leaf area index is to maximize the net photosynthetic productivity. Increasing the number of tillers will correspondingly increase the leaf area; however, if the leaf area is too large, the light between plants will be weakened, which will reduce the net photosynthetic productivity. In addition, if there are too many tillers, the humidity will increase due to insufficient light between plants, which can easily cause overgrowth and lodging. For individuals, under the same cultivation level, the net photosynthetic productivity tends to decrease with increasing density; but for the population net photosynthetic productivity, it increases correspondingly with the increase in density within a certain density range, but after exceeding a certain density range, it will cause the population net photosynthetic productivity to decrease. From the yield results, according to the density tests (basic seedling range between 75,000 and 900,000) conducted in Beijing, Shandong, Henan, Shaanxi, Hubei, Yunnan and other provinces and cities, the yield of 255,000 to 389,000 basic seedlings was the highest. This once again proves that in the field, the sowing density should not be too sparse or too dense, and it is necessary to master the dynamic population structure of seedling, plant, spike, and grain growth and development in order to have a more suitable leaf area index and higher photosynthetic productivity, and maximize the use of light energy and nutrient conditions.

              Population Structure Indicators for High Yields of 1,000 Jin
    According to the high-yield experiences of various regions this year and the research data accumulated over the years, in order to strive for a high yield of 1,000 jin per mu of winter wheat on a large area, the following population structure scheme is initially proposed: Population structure of high-yield fields with a large area of 1,000 jin per mu.

Different wheat regions | Basic seedlings (10,000/mu) | Total number of tillers before winter (10,000/mu) | Highest total number of tillers after winter (10,000/mu) | Number of formed spikes (10,000/mu) | Number of grains per spike (grains) | Thousand-grain weight (grams)
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
Northern winter wheat region | 25-35 | 90-110 | 120-150 | 60-70 | 22-28 | 35-40
Central winter wheat region | 25-35 | 80-100 | 110-130 | 45-60 | 25-35 | 35-38
Southern winter wheat region | 20-35 | 70-90 | 80-100 | 30-45 | 30-40 | 34-44

    According to the range of indicators listed in the above table, the specific implementation should be flexibly grasped according to the characteristics of the variety, the level of soil fertility, the earliness of the sowing date, and the regional climate characteristics. In addition, strengthening late-stage management on the premise of a certain number of spikes and grains can increase the grain weight, which is also of great significance for striving for high yields.

      Main Measures to Achieve Reasonable Population Structure
    From a large number of high-yield cultivation experiments and practical experience, this year has found a path to high-quota yields, which is to keep wheat plants in healthy growth momentum at all times, and to have a reasonable population structure at all stages of growth and development, so as to maximize the use of nutrients and light energy, master the formation rules of wheat seedlings, plants, spikes, and grains from sowing to harvesting, and use their tillering characteristics, adopt the principle of looking at the sky, the land, the seedlings, and the time, conduct scientific management, actively promote and appropriately control each other, so that each link is closely linked, the measures are connected, and no effort is spared, so that the final high-quota yield is achieved.
    The population structure that can maximize the use of nutrients and light energy at each stage of wheat's life is a reasonable structure. Therefore, different natural conditions, fertility levels, and management levels have their own different reasonable structures. To determine what kind of structure different wheat fields should have, first, it is necessary to fully understand and unify the many contradictions that exist in the entire growth and development process of wheat. Each stage of wheat's growth and development is affected by the environmental conditions and its own growth characteristics at that time, and at the same time affects the development of the next stage. According to the analysis of the materials of high-yield fields of 1,000 jin, in the stage mainly based on vegetative growth (emergence, tillering), it is necessary to promote the tillering and root growth before winter, strive for uniform and strong seedlings, prevent excessive growth, and lay the foundation for more spikes and no lodging; in the stage where vegetative growth and reproductive growth are carried out simultaneously (overwintering, jointing), it is necessary to promote the full development of young spikes, inhibit excessive lushness of stems and leaves, strive to grow into large spikes, and lay the foundation for more grains; in the stage mainly based on reproductive growth (booting, grain filling), it is necessary to promote grain setting and grain formation, strive for more grains and heavier grains, and prevent lodging in the later stage.

                              Fertilizer
    How much fertilizer is needed for a yield of 1,000 jin per mu? From the data already available, nitrogen fertilizer ranges from 30 jin to 100 jin; phosphorus fertilizer ranges from 27 jin to 63 jin; potassium fertilizer ranges from 27 jin to 87 jin. The amount of fertilizer used varies greatly. This is because the fertility level of wheat fields is different, and the types and methods of fertilizer application are different, resulting in great differences in the effective utilization rate.

    Judging from some examples, in order to obtain a wheat yield of around 1,000 jin per mu, on the basis of selecting medium-to-high fertility fields, applying 10,000 to 15,000 jin of high-quality organic fertilizer per mu, supplemented with 40 to 50 jin of ammonium sulfate, 40 to 50 jin of superphosphate, and a small amount of potash fertilizer, equivalent to about 50 jin of nitrogen, 50 jin of phosphorus, and 50 to 60 jin of potassium, is sufficient.

    From the perspective of fertilization methods, base fertilizer generally accounts for 40% to 70% of the total fertilization amount (base fertilizer in the 1,000-jin field of Henan Agricultural College accounts for 58%), topdressing before winter accounts for 20%-30%, and topdressing after winter accounts for 10%-20%. Base fertilizer is generally based on organic fertilizer. The fertilizer effect of organic fertilizer is long. Applying enough base fertilizer can not only continuously supply nutrients throughout the entire wheat growth period, but also have a good effect on controlling the early overgrowth of wheat plants and preventing late-stage premature aging; it can also improve the soil, promote the reproduction and activity of soil microorganisms, and thus continuously improve soil fertility. On the basis of applying enough base fertilizer, reasonable and economical topdressing is an important way to fully utilize fertilizer resources and increase yields. This year, many units conducted research on the fertilizer absorption law of high-yield wheat. For example, Henan Agricultural College combined with the research results of the 1,000-jin high-yield field, the most nitrogen fertilizer is absorbed before overwintering in each growth period of wheat, followed by phosphorus and potassium fertilizer; nitrogen fertilizer is still more abundant from overwintering to overwintering, and phosphorus and potassium begin to increase significantly; potassium is absorbed the most from overwintering to jointing, and the absorption of phosphorus fertilizer increases sharply; during the period from jointing to heading, the absorption of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium fertilizer by plants reaches its peak, with potassium fertilizer being absorbed the most, followed by nitrogen and phosphorus fertilizer; the absorption of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium fertilizer generally decreases from heading to maturity, but continues to be absorbed until maturity.

    In terms of the specific experience of applying topdressing in stages, Gui Jingyuan, a wheat cultivation expert from the Huidong People's Commune in Liu'an, Anhui, summed up the growth law of wheat "three greens and two yellows" based on years of production practice ("green" means that the stems and leaves are growing strongly, and the leaf color is dark green; "yellow" means that the leaf color turns light and the growth momentum is normal), that is, the first green from emergence to tillering, the first yellow after the tillering stops growing before winter and enters the overwintering period, the second green during the overwintering period, the second yellow after overwintering before jointing, and the third green during the jointing and booting period. Huang Meishan, a labor model from the Baqiao People's Commune in Yangzhou County, Jiangsu, also proposed that wheat has a law of overwintering-green, jointing-yellow, and booting-green. In addition, Zhejiang, Henan and other places also have the experience of green-yellow-green. Taking corresponding fertilization measures according to the different fertilizer needs of wheat at different stages of growth and development is an important experience for achieving economical fertilizer use and high yield without lodging.

                              Water
      "Whether there is a harvest depends on water, and how much harvest depends on fertilizer." This year's winter wheat main producing areas are an abnormally dry year. In Hebei Province, it only rained 85.4 mm in the 256 days from wheat sowing to harvest, of which the rainfall in the 123 days from overwintering to harvest was only 19.8 mm; according to the observations in Wugong, Qishan, and Pucheng, Shaanxi Province, the rainfall was 171 mm, 176 mm, and 319 mm less than the water requirement, respectively. In the case of frequent spring droughts in the north and autumn droughts in the south, irrigation plays an important role in increasing wheat yield. According to the observation results of the Wheat Research Institute of Hebei Province, increasing the irrigation water by 15 to 30 cubic meters can increase the yield by about 100 jin in medium-fertility wheat fields, and increasing the irrigation water by 45 cubic meters can increase the yield by about 200 jin in fertile wheat fields. Irrigation must also grasp the principle of looking at the sky, the land, and the crops. If 18% to 20% of the soil moisture (70% to 80% of the maximum field water holding capacity) can be maintained during the entire growth period of wheat, it is most suitable for wheat growth. In order to achieve economical water use, for soil with strong water retention capacity, land leveling and ridge irrigation are required to achieve high-standard gardenification. The amount of irrigation water should be determined according to the seedling condition and soil moisture condition. Generally, the amount of irrigation water for pre-sowing water, winter water, and heading water is large, and the amount of irrigation water for overwintering water, jointing water, and grain-filling water should be small. The soil humidity should generally not exceed 85% of the maximum water holding capacity. Excessive soil humidity is harmful to the activity of the root system. Therefore, drainage work is very important in humid areas south of the Yangtze River Basin and low-lying areas in the north. In water network polder areas, the use of artificial pre-lowering of the inner river water level to control the groundwater level of wheat fields at 60 to 85 cm below the lowest field surface has a significant yield-increasing effect.

                              Soil
    The role of deep plowing is to create a good environment for root growth. In response to the previous shallow plowing, appropriately deepening the plowing layer improves soil aeration and water retention, enhances soil microbial activity, and improves soil fertility. The facts of many high-yield fields this year once again prove the yield-increasing effect of deep plowing. How deep should the plowing be? According to the survey materials from various regions, the range of wheat root activity is basically maintained within the 20 to 30 cm soil layer. Therefore, deep plowing to about one foot can generally achieve significant yield increases. Some soils have the greatest yield-increasing effect when plowed to one and a half feet. From a regional perspective, the southern soil is sticky and difficult to cultivate, and the plowing depth is mostly 6 to 8 inches; the northern soil is looser, mostly 8 inches to one foot. With deep plowing, applying enough base fertilizer, and meticulous plowing and harrowing to improve the quality of land preparation are the basic conditions for exerting the yield-increasing effect of deep plowing.

                            Seed
    With the improvement of the yield level, the role of improved varieties becomes more and more important. For example, under the same cultivation management conditions, Henan Agricultural College planted the Nanda 2419 variety with a yield of 1,000 jin per mu, while the Baiyupi variety yielded 821 jin per mu, and the Bima No. 1 variety yielded only 642 jin per mu. This year, the high-yield fields with a yield of 1,000 jin per mu without exception all selected high-yielding varieties with large spikes, large grains, strong stalks, disease resistance, and lodging resistance. The southern wheat region mostly selects Nanda 2419, Ailiduo, Sichuan Wuyi Wheat, etc.; the central wheat region mostly selects Nanda 2419, Northwest 54, Bima No. 4, etc.; the northern wheat region mostly selects Zaoyang Wheat, North China 187, Nongda 183, Beijing No. 6 and other varieties. In addition to the above varieties, Neixiang No. 5 and Neixiang No. 36 bred by Gong Wensheng, a farmer breeder in Neixiang, Henan, Northwest 612 and Northwest 614 bred by the Shaanxi Branch of the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Yuejin No. 5 bred by the Shandong Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Anhui No. 5 bred by the Anhui Academy of Agricultural Sciences, and the introduced varieties Founo, Mara, and Abo are all worth accelerating reproduction and promotion. However, in different regions, even different soil qualities, different fertility levels, and different sowing times in the same region, there are suitable improved varieties. Therefore, each region must select several varieties for use in combination to prevent variety homogenization.

    Based on deep plowing, with fertilizer, water, and improved varieties as prerequisites, the central problem is to strengthen field management. In the entire growth process of wheat, it is necessary to fully utilize and strengthen favorable factors, and strive to avoid and overcome unfavorable factors, around the reasonable population structure, solve the three key problems of controlling tillering, cultivating strong plants, and high yield without lodging, and carry out strong stems, attack spikes, and increase grains and weight on the basis of full seedlings and strong seedlings, create conditions, and improve yield.

                    Full Seedlings and Strong Seedlings
    Full seedlings means reaching the expected number of basic seedlings per mu in accordance with the requirements of a reasonable population structure. The number of basic seedlings varies according to region, variety, sowing time, soil fertility level, and cultivation management level. How many seeds to sow also depends on the size of the seeds, the height of the germination rate, and the strength of the germination potential. Under the current general field production conditions, due to the limitations of land preparation, sowing, and other conditions, even if the seed germination rate is not too bad, the general emergence rate is only about 70%, which is "10,000 seedlings per jin of seeds." In the sticky rice soil area in the south and the arid area in the north, the emergence rate often only reaches 40% to 50%. Therefore, the sowing amount must be determined according to the actual possible number of seedlings.

    The concept of strong seedlings is "strong but not strong," which is a reflection of the results of appropriate density, appropriate sowing time, and reasonable fertilization, irrigation, and other seedling management. The general standard of strong seedlings is that the number of tillers per plant before winter reaches three to five in the northern wheat region (900,000 to 1,100,000 per mu), three to four in the central wheat region (800,000 to 1,000,000 per mu), and two to three in the southern wheat region (700,000 to 900,000 per mu). The leaf area index is maintained at one to two, and there are a certain number of secondary roots and a healthy growth momentum.

                    Strong Stems and Spike Attack
    Overwintering Stage: The characteristics of this period are: the northern wheat seedlings turn from yellow to green, restoring the growth of new green bodies, the southern wheat seedlings accelerate the growth rate, a large number of secondary roots are bred, the tillers before winter continue to grow, and new tillers reappear, and the spike primordium also begins to differentiate. There are contradictions between the underground part and the above-ground part, the contradictions between the elongation of the main stem leaves and the growth of tillers in wheat growth and development, and the contradictions between vegetative growth and spike development. From the perspective of the requirements of a reasonable population structure, we should first ensure the healthy growth of tillers before winter to improve the heading rate. During this period, the second peak of tillering will also appear (that is, the second vigorous growth period). Under the current cultivation conditions, the maximum number of tillers after winter must be controlled within the range of: 1.2 million to 1.5 million in the north, 1.1 million to 1.3 million in the middle, and 800,000 to 1 million in the south, and the growth of spring tillers should be controlled as much as possible, not exceeding 200,000 to 400,000, so as not to consume nutrients and form shading and lodging. To achieve the reasonable population structure of this period with a goal has become the central task of management.

    During the overwintering period, the soil temperature is still low, and the soil microbial activity is weak. The base fertilizer and the organic fertilizer applied before winter cannot be quickly decomposed to supply the needs of wheat to resume growth after overwintering. Therefore, the application of an appropriate amount of fast-acting fertilizer at this time to supplement the deficiency of soil nutrients is very effective. Fertilization at this time can consolidate the tillers before winter, promote the differentiation of young spikes, increase the number of spikelets, and at the same time strive for some early spring tillers to form spikes. For late-sown wheat fields with few tillers before winter and poor growth, or wheat fields with insufficient base fertilizer, early sowing, and obvious fertilizer loss, early application and heavy application of fast-acting fertilizer (mainly nitrogen fertilizer) has a prominent and important role.

    There is a debate about the timing of watering the overwintering water. Some people advocate watering the overwintering water appropriately later, believing that under the condition that the soil moisture is not too much, the fertilizer is decomposed slowly, the plants grow strongly, and at the same time, watering the overwintering water later can appropriately postpone the time of watering the jointing water, which is conducive to controlling the elongation of the internodes; some people advocate watering the overwintering water earlier, believing that the soil temperature decreases after watering, the temperature becomes worse, the plants grow slowly and squat firmly, and at the same time, due to the dissolution of nutrients in the surface layer, it is conducive to the breeding of secondary roots and the growth of tillers before winter. According to the observation results of the Institute of Farmland Irrigation of the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, watering the overwintering water early can effectively promote the early recovery and growth of wheat plants. Of course, when to water the overwintering water is not easy to judge simply from the timing, but also according to the soil moisture, water temperature, soil texture, and wheat seedling growth conditions at that time.

    In terms of early spring management, in addition to timely and appropriate supply of fertilizer and water, general high-yield fields also need to effectively use consolidation, deep cultivation and other measures that combine promotion and control. Regarding the consolidation effect, according to the experimental results of the Zhejiang Academy of Agricultural Sciences, the plants grow strongly after consolidation, the plant height and the length of the basal internodes are shortened, the stem thickness is increased, and the spike traits are improved, so the yield is 12.2% higher than those without consolidation. Consolidation also significantly changes the structure of the stem tissue, such as the thickness of the mechanical tissue, the thickness of the cell wall, and the number of vascular bundles are increased, so it is beneficial to enhance the lodging resistance of wheat plants. The experimental results of the Yanshi Base of the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences in the Yuetan Brigade show that the plant height is uniform, the spike size is relatively neat, the number of spikes per plant is increased, and the number of spikes per mu is also increased accordingly after consolidation in early spring (March 1).

    Deep cultivation can promote the occurrence and elongation of new roots, make the seedlings stout, the roots developed, and has the effect of preventing lodging. Continuous deep cultivation (three times, once before the year and twice after the year; four times, twice before and after the year) can effectively control the growth of wheat plants. The Zhejiang Academy of Agricultural Sciences conducted a survey after two deep cultivations on January 4 and February 5, and saw that the wheat plant internodes were short, the stems were thick, and the growth was strong.

    Jointing Stage: Wheat jointing marks the entry of vegetative growth into a vigorous period, and reproductive growth has begun. At this time, the young spikes are differentiating florets, the internodes at the base of the stem are rapidly elongating, the leaf differentiation is nearing completion, and it is necessary to supply sufficient water and nutrients so that after the temperature rises, the plants will quickly increase to reach the maximum leaf area index, through the enhancement of photosynthesis, accumulate a large number of carbohydrates, increase the heading rate and increase the number of grains set per spike. At this time, the main contradictions are manifested in vegetative growth and reproductive growth, and the growth of main tillers and the growth of tillers. On the premise of the maximum development of the population, some weak tillers and small tillers begin to die due to insufficient nutrients and light, forming a natural sparse regulation of individual development to promote the development of the population, to ensure that the main stem and part of the tillers smoothly carry out spike differentiation and development. In order to achieve the reasonable structure of the population in this period, it is required to supply sufficient nutrients and water, enhance vegetative growth, and strive for the main stem and part of the tillers to form spikes to reach a certain number of spikes and grains; at the same time, it is necessary to appropriately control the maximum leaf area index not to exceed "seven" to prevent stem overgrowth and lodging.

    今年冬小麦高产经验的分析	中国农业科学院栽培生理研究所
    今年各地冬小麦丰产经验总结比以往提高了一步，总结的面更广，内容也更丰富。中国农业科学院栽培生理研究所于7月20日至29日在河南郑州召开了冬小麦丰产技术研究会议，交流了各地创造大面积丰产和高额丰产的经验，研究了亩产千斤上下的技术措施及其理论依据。下面是我们对今年冬小麦高产经验的初步分析。
          高产田的群体合理结构高产的构成因素
    今年全国各地涌现了很多亩产千斤左右的小麦高额丰产田。研究各地高产田的产量构成情况，大致可以归纳为以下几种类型：第一、北方麦区或北方型品种获得千斤高产的，每亩穗数多在六十五万左右，每穗二十到二十三粒，千粒重三十六克左右；第二、中部麦区大穗型品种获得千斤高产的，每亩穗数多在五十万左右，每穗三十粒上下，千粒重在三十二到三十八克之间；第三、南方麦区大穗型品种获得千斤高产的，又可分为三种情况：其一是每亩穗数较多，如安徽六安渒东公社与江苏扬中八桥公社高产田，每亩穗数在五十万左右，每穗二十八到三十粒，千粒重约三十三克；其二是每亩穗数较少，而穗子特大，如四川省农业科学研究所丰产田只有二十三万三千穗，但每穗达四十四点八粒，千粒重达四十克；其三是每亩穗数在三十六到四十万之间，每穗三十五粒左右，千粒重三十六到四十克，如四川乐至县红旗公社的高产田。从以上几种情况分析，大致可以看出，北方高产田的产量构成因素是以穗多为特点；南方高产田的穗数比北方少，但每穗粒数多，是构成高产的特点。中部麦区（包括河北省石家庄以南及河南、山东、陕西关中一带）则每亩穗数居中，而每穗粒数及千粒重较高。各地区取得高产的不同途径，反映了地区气候的特点，以及相适应的品种类型在产量构成上的差异。北方地区由于气候比较寒冷、干燥，品种的分蘖力及成穗数较高，因而其所适应的穗数多于南方；南方地区的气候比较温暖、潮湿，品种的分蘖力及成穗数较低，同时由于在冬季继续生长，植株比较繁茂，田间郁蔽和倒伏的威胁较大，因而其所适应的穗数少于北方，这是在设计高产田群体结构时应该考虑的问题。
            高产田群体合理结构的科学依据
      （1）保证群体的最大发展。
    合理密植是取得高产的中心环节。在合理密植的基础上，通过一系列的促进与控制相结合的栽培管理措施，在保证群体最大发展的前提下，使个体得到健壮的生长发育，从而统一了个体和群体的矛盾，达到穗多、穗大、粒多、粒饱。各地高产田资料表明，亩产能达千斤左右的，基本苗多为二十到四十万，单株分蘖数在年前为二到五个，年后为四到六个，单株成穗一点三到二个，冬前每亩总分蘖数多为九十到一百一十万，年后每亩最高总分蘖数多为一百一十到一百四十万，每亩成穗多在四十到七十万之间。这些个体和群体结构的指标，无论是从获得高产事实本身或从各地密植研究的结果来看，在目前的栽培水平下，都证明了它们的合理性。不少资料进一步指出，在向高产田发展过程中，合理密植还不能只理解为增加播种密度，而是要掌握个体和群体生长发育的动态规律及其协调关系；如果栽培管理不当，即使是在合理的播种密度范围内，也不能取得高产。北京市郊区去秋的播种量绝大部分是在每亩三十斤左右，基本苗数多为三十到三十五万株，但是每亩总分蘖数和穗数的变化幅度相差很大。凡是冬前分蘖数在六、七十万以下，最高分蘖数不足九十万的，每亩穗数很难达到五十万；凡冬前分蘖数超过一百一十万，最高分蘖数达到一百四十万以上的，则大都徒长倒伏，纵有较高穗数，但粒少粒小，以上二种类型产量都低。其中有不少亩产千斤上下的麦田，冬前一般有健壮分蘖一百万左右，最高分蘖数都在一百三十万到一百四十万之间，成穗率高达50％左右，每亩穗数在六十万到七十万之间。由于群体在全生育期都处在优良的发育条件下，植株就保证了穗多、穗大、粒多、粒饱而高产。
      （2）充分发挥穗多、粒多、粒大的潜力，并协调三者的相互关系。
    在一定的栽培条件下，穗多、粒多、粒大三者之间存在着一定的矛盾关系，也就是说当单位面积内穗数增加以后，每穗粒数就有减少的趋势，子粒也会在一定程度内变小。但是，这种关系不是绝对的。当栽培水平提高以后，三者的矛盾关系可以取得进一步的协调和统一。这标志着综合运用“农业八字宪法”的进一步发展。从今年大量的高产实例可见，每亩穗数，均在不同程度上突破了以往的界限，在每亩有四十万到七十万穗的范围内，一般每穗粒数达到二十四粒以上，而且有不少在二十七到三十粒左右，最高达四十四点八粒。千粒重多在三十到四十克之间，个别达到四十九点六克。在保证每穗粒数或千粒重不显著降低的前提下，根据我们的研究，北方麦区，目前每亩可以达到七十万穗；中部麦区每亩可达五十万穗；南方麦区根据江苏分院调查，每亩可达四十万穗左右。今年在南方地区也还有个别田块是在较少的穗数下，争取穗大粒多而获得高产的。从南方多雨潮湿和倒伏威胁较大的栽培条件推断，在控制一定穗数的基础上，争取大穗高产，比较容易达到。
      （3）掌握苗、株、穗、粒生长发育的动态群体合理结构，提高光合生产率。
    在一定范围内，以穗多为基础，力争粒多、粒大，是目前千斤高产的基本途径。达到这个目标的主要关键在于掌握苗、株、穗、粒生长发育的动态群体合理结构，最大限度地利用营养与光能以提高光合生产率。它涉及基本苗的确定和各个时期分蘖与叶面积的消长，以及植株前期和后期生长发育的协调，物质积累和转化等问题。归根结底是以合理密植为中心，综合运用“农业八字宪法”，使小麦按照人的意志合理生长发育，从而获得高产。
    在设计高产的群体结构时，首要的问题就是确定适宜的基本苗，从今年各地高产田的基本苗数来看，虽因不同地区、品种、栽培条件而有不同，但除个别例子低于二十万株以外，其余都在二十到四十万株范围之内，而大多是二十五万到三十五万株之间。从今年各地密度试验结果分析，一般在中上等肥力条件下，获得高产的基本苗密度大致也在这个幅度以内。在肥力特高、精细管理的栽培条件下，适应密度有减小的趋势。在大面积的条件下，以应用较多的基本苗来获得高产较为可靠。
    在合理的基本苗基础上，争取适宜数量的健壮分蘖，是获得高产的第二个环节。分析今年的资料，再一次论证了有分蘖的植株对获得大穗有着密切的关系。据我所和江苏分院等单位调查，凡具有分蘖成穗的植株都比较穗大粒大，即使是具有无效分蘖的植株也比单秆植株的强，在茎秆粗壮和根系发育等性状上也都优于没有分蘖的单秆植株。江苏分院用在水培条件下观察养分运转的情况，证明主茎和分蘖间根系所吸收的营养可以相互运转，在拔节期间正常分蘖的营养约有38％供给主茎，而发黄分蘖则有40％左右营养供给主茎。这个资料说明了在生长适当分蘖的条件下，由于永久根增长较多，也将促进主茎和大蘖的生长。此外，今年不少高产田的分蘖成穗率较高，说明了在控制一定分蘖的前提下，提高分蘖成穗，对于争取高产是一重要的环节。
    分蘖多少与每亩叶面积紧密相关，而各生育期叶面积大小又与光能利用有关。因此探求小麦各个生育阶段叶面积系数（叶面积系数就是全部叶面积为地面的倍数）指标，以及研究叶面积大小所造成的影响，也是考虑群体合理结构的一个重要方面。
    河南农学院千斤丰产田是在每亩三十九万四千个基本苗的条件下达到的，单株分蘖数年前达到二点九个，返青后达到三点四个，可以认为是达到了壮苗的要求；返青后总分蘖数虽然达到一百十四万九千个，但由于南大二四一九这个品种在生育中期分蘖具有迅速稀疏的特点，因而至拔节期每亩分蘖数下降为八十八万七千个，使田间通风透光仍属良好，茎秆生长健壮，幼穗发育正常，至成熟时也未倒伏。根据各地的资料研究，冬前和返青初期叶面积系数维持在一点五到二，可以成长为壮苗，拔节后最大叶面积系数维持在六到七范围内，在目前栽培条件下，可以认为是争取充分利用光能，增加光合产物的合理指标。
    争取合理的叶面积系数，是为了最大限度地提高净光合生产率，分蘖数增多相应地会使叶面积加大；但是叶面积过大，株间光照削弱，反而会造成净光合生产率的降低。另外分蘖过多后由于株间光照不足，湿度增大，也容易引起徒长和倒伏。对个体而言，在相同的栽培水平下，净光合生产率随增加密度有递减的趋势；但对群体净光合生产率而言，则在一定密度范围之内随密度的增加而相应提高，不过超过一定密度范围之后，则引起群体净光合生产率降低。从产量结果来看，根据北京、山东、河南、陕西、湖北、云南等省、市进行的密度试验（基本苗范围在七万五千到九十万之间）结果，以二十五万五千到三十八万九千的基本苗产量为最高。这就再一次证明，大田里，播种密度不可太稀、也不可太密，必须掌握苗、株、穗、粒生长发育的动态群体合理结构，才能具有较适宜的叶面积系数和较高的光合生产率，最大限度地利用光能和营养条件。
              千斤高产的群体合理结构指标
    根据今年各地高产经验以及历年所积累的研究资料，为了在大面积上争取冬小麦的亩产千斤高产，初步提出了以下的群体结构方案：大面积亩产千斤高产田的群体结构不同麦区  基本苗  年前总分蘖数  年后最高总分蘖数  成穗数  每穗粒数  千粒重	（万—亩）（万—亩）    （万—亩）      （万—亩）  （个）  （克）北方冬麦区25—35    90—110      120—150       60—70    22—283   5—40中部冬麦区25—35    80—100      110—130       45—60    25—35    35—38南方冬麦区20—35    70—90       80—100        30—45    30—40    34—44
    根据上表所列指标范围，具体执行时就要按照品种特性、土壤肥力水平、播种期早晚以及地区气候特点等条件予以灵活掌握。此外，在一定穗数和粒数的前提下加强后期管理，可以增加粒重，对于争取高产，同样具有重要意义。
      实现群体合理结构的主要措施
    从大量的丰产栽培试验和实践经验来看，今年已经找到了一条通向高额丰产的门径，就是使小麦植株始终保持健壮的生长势，在生长发育的各个阶段都能有合理的群体结构，来最大限度地利用营养与光能，从种到收掌握小麦苗、株、穗、粒的形成规律，利用其分蘖的特性，采取看天、看地、看苗、看时的原则，进行科学管理，积极促进和适当控制相结合，作到环环扣紧，措施相连，一着不让，使最后达到高额丰产。
    在小麦一生各个阶段都能最大限度地利用营养与光能的群体结构就是合理结构。因此不同的自然条件、肥力水平与管理水平，都有其不同的合理结构。要确定不同麦田应有那一种结构，首先必须充分了解和统一小麦整个生长发育过程存在的许多矛盾。小麦的每一个生长发育阶段都受当时环境条件和本身生长特性的影响，同时又影响着下一阶段的发展。根据已经掌握的千斤上下高产田的材料分析，在营养生长为主体的阶段（出苗、分蘖），要促进冬前分蘖和根系生长，争取苗匀、苗壮，防止过旺徒长，为穗多不倒打下基础；在营养生长和生殖生长同时进行的阶段（返青、拔节），要促进幼穗充分发育，抑制茎叶过分繁茂，争取长成大穗，为粒多打下基础；在生殖生长为主体的阶段（孕穗、灌浆），要促进结实成粒，争取粒多、粒重，防止后期倒伏。
                              肥
    亩产千斤究竟需要多少肥料，从已经掌握的资料来看，氮肥自三十斤至一百斤；磷肥自二十七斤至六十三斤；钾肥自二十七斤至八十七斤。肥料的用量十分悬殊。这是由于麦田地力水平不同以及施用肥料种类不同，方法不同，以至有效利用率有极大差别。
    从一些例子推断，要获得亩产千斤上下的小麦产量，在选用中上肥力田的基础上，每亩施用一万到一万五千斤质量较好的有机质肥料，并辅以四十到五十斤硫铵，四十到五十斤过磷酸钙，和少量的钾肥，大约折合氮五十多斤、磷五十多斤、和钾五十到六十斤即足够用。
    从施肥方法来看，底肥一般占总施肥量的40％到70％（河南农学院千斤田底肥占58％），冬前追肥占20％—30％，冬后追肥占10％—20％。底肥一般以有机肥料为主，有机肥料的肥效时间长，施足底肥不仅可以在整个小麦生育期间源源不断地供应养分，对控制麦株前期徒长和防止后期早衰有良好作用；同时还能够改良土壤，促进土壤微生物的繁殖及活动，从而不断提高土壤肥力。在施足底肥的基础上，合理经济施用追肥，是充分利用肥源提高产量的重要办法。今年有不少单位进行丰产小麦吸肥规律的研究，如河南农学院结合千斤丰产田研究结果，在小麦各个生育期中越冬前吸收氮肥最多，磷、钾肥次之；越冬至返青仍以氮肥较多，磷、钾开始显著增加；返青至拔节吸收钾最多，吸收磷肥急剧增加；拔节至抽穗时期植株对氮、磷、钾肥的吸收均达最高峰，其中以钾肥吸收最多，氮，磷肥次之；抽穗至成熟对氮、磷、钾肥吸收普遍下降，但一直到成熟仍继续吸收。
    在分期追肥的具体经验方面，安徽六安渒东人民公社小麦栽培能手桂景元同志根据多年生产实践总结出小麦“三青两黄”的生长规律（“青”是表示茎叶生长势强，叶色浓绿；“黄”是叶色转淡，生长势平常），即出苗后至分蘖期第一次青，年前分蘖停止生长后进入越冬期第一次黄，返青期第二次青，返青后拔节前第二次黄，拔节孕穗期第三次青。江苏扬中县八桥人民公社劳动模范黄美善同志也提出小麦有返青—青，拔节—黄，孕穗—青的规律。此外，浙江、河南等地也有青—黄—青的经验。针对小麦生长发育不同阶段需肥的不同，采取相应的施肥措施，是达到经济用肥、既丰产又不倒伏的重要经验。
                              水
      “收多收少在于肥，有收无收在于水”。今年冬小麦主要产区是一个异常干旱的年份。河北省从小麦播种起到收获的二百五十六天中，只降雨八十五点四毫米，其中返青到收获的一百二十三天中降雨量仅为十九点八毫米；陕西省根据武功、?厔、蒲城三地观测降雨量分别比需水量相差一百七十一毫米、一百七十六毫米、三百十九毫米。在北方春旱及南方秋旱经常发生的情况下，灌溉对提高小麦产量有着重要作用。根据河北省小麦研究所观察结果，中等肥力水平麦田增加灌水量十五到三十公方即可增产一百斤左右，在肥沃麦田增加灌水量四十五公方即可增产二百斤左右。灌水也必须掌握看天、看地、看庄稼的原则。在小麦整个生育期间，如能保持18％到20％的土壤水分
  （田间最大持水量的70％到80％），对小麦生长最为适宜。为了实现经济用水，土壤保水力强，就要求土地平整，筑畦灌溉，实现高标准园田化。灌水量要根据苗情、墒情而定，一般播前水、冬水、抽穗水的灌水量较大，返青水、拔节水、灌浆水的灌水量宜小。土壤湿度一般不宜超过最大持水量的85％，土壤湿度过大有害于根系的活动，因此，在长江流域以南多湿地区和北方低洼地区排水工作非常重要，在水网圩区利用人工预降内河水位，使麦田的地下水位控制在最低田面以下六十到八十五厘米，有着显著增产作用。
                              土
    深耕的作用在于为根系生长创造一个良好的环境，针对以往浅耕的情况，适当加深耕层，改善了土壤的通气性和保水力，增进了土壤微生物活动而提高土壤肥力，今年许多丰产田的事实又一次证明深耕的增产作用。究竟耕深多少为宜，根据各地调查材料来看，小麦根系活动范围基本上保持在二十到三十厘米土层以内，因此，在一般情况下深耕至一尺左右即能获得显著增产，有些土壤则以耕到一尺半增产效果最大。从地区来看，南方土壤粘重、整地困难，耕地深度多在六寸到八寸；北方土壤较疏松，多在八寸到一尺。配合深耕施足底肥，精耕细耙，提高整地质量，是发挥深耕增产作用的基本条件。
                            种
    随着产量水平的提高，良种的作用越显得重要。例如，河南农学院在同样栽培管理条件下，种植南大二四一九品种亩产达到千斤，而白玉皮品种亩产八百二十一斤，碧蚂一号品种亩产只有六百四十二斤。今年各地亩产千斤丰产田，无例外的都是选用穗大、粒大、秆硬、抗病、抗倒伏的丰产类型品种，南方麦区多选用南大二四一九、矮立多、四川五一麦等；中部麦区多选用南大二四一九、西北五四、碧蚂四号等；北方麦区多选用早洋麦、华北一八七、农大一八三、北京六号等品种。除上述品种外，河南内乡农民育种家龚文生同志选育的内乡五号、内乡三十六号，中国农业科学院陕西分院选育的西北六一二、西北六一四，山东省农业科学院选育的跃进五号，安徽省农业科学研究所选育的安徽五号，以及引进的夫诺、玛拉、阿勃等品种，都值得加速繁殖和推广。但是，在不同地区以至同一地区的不同土质、不同肥力和不同播种时期，都有其相适宜的优良品种，因此，每一地区必须选择若干个品种配合使用，防止品种单一化。
    以深耕为基础，肥、水、良种为前提，在保证一定基本苗的情况下，中心的问题是加强田间管理。在小麦整个生育过程中，要充分利用和加强有利因素，力求避免和克服不利因素，环绕群体合理结构，解决控制分蘖、培育壮株、高产不倒三大关键，并在全苗、壮苗的基础上进行壮秆、攻穗和增粒、增重，创造条件，提高产量。
                    全　苗　壮　苗
    苗全就是按照群体合理结构的要求，达到每亩预计的基本苗数。基本苗数根据地区、品种、播种时期、地力水平以及耕作管理水平而不同。究竟播种多少种子，还要根据种子的大小、发芽率的高低、发芽势的强弱等来调节。在目前一般大田生产情况下，由于整地、播种等条件限制，即使种子发芽率不太差，一般出苗率仅为70％上下，也就是“斤籽万苗”。在南方粘重水稻土地区，以及北方干旱地区，出苗率常常仅达40％到50％。因此，必须根据实际可能的出苗数来确定播种量。
    苗壮的概念是“壮而不旺”，是反映适宜密度、适宜播种时期和合理的施肥、灌水等苗期管理的结果。一般壮苗标准是，冬前单株分蘖北方麦区达到三到五个（每亩九十到一百一十万）、中部麦区达到三到四个（每亩八十到一百万）、南方麦区达到二到三个（每亩七十到九十万），叶面积系数保持一到二，并有一定数量的次生根和健壮的生长势。
                    壮　秆　攻　穗
    返青关：这一时期的特征是：北方麦苗由黄转绿，恢复生长新的绿色体，南方麦苗加快生长速度，次生根大量滋生，年前分蘖继续生长，并重新出现新的分蘖，穗原始体也开始分化。在小麦生长发育上存在着地下部和地上部的矛盾，地上部主茎叶片伸长和分蘖生长的矛盾，以及营养体生长和穗部发育的矛盾。从群体合理结构要求来看，应首先保证冬前分蘖健壮生长以提高成穗率。在此期间还会出现分蘖的第二个高峰（即第二次旺长期），在目前的栽培条件下，必须把冬后最高分蘖数控制在：北方一百二十万到一百五十万，中部一百一十万到一百三十万，南方八十万到一百万的范围之内，尽可能控制春季分蘖的滋生，不要超过二十万到四十万个，以免过多后消耗养分并形成郁蔽倒伏。有目标地实现这一期的群体合理结构，成为管理的中心任务。
    返青期间土壤温度尚低，土壤微生物活动弱，底肥和冬前施用的有机肥料不能迅速分解供应小麦返青生长的需要，因此，此时施用适量的速效肥料，补充土壤养分的不足，效果极为良好。这时施肥能巩固年前分蘖、促使幼穗分化、小穗数目加多，同时可以争取部分早春分蘖成穗。对于年前分蘖少、生长较差的晚播麦田，或者底肥不足、播种早、已显脱肥的麦田，早施、重施速效性肥料（主要是氮肥）有着突出重要的作用。
    关于浇返青水时间的早晚，是有争论的问题。有人主张适当晚浇返青水，认为在土壤水分不太多的情况下，肥分分解缓慢，植株生长健壮，同时，晚浇返青水可以适当推延浇拔节水的时间，有利于控制节间徒长；也有人主张早浇返青水，认为浇水后地温下降，温度变差小，植株生长缓慢蹲实，同时由于表层养分溶解，有利于次生根滋生和年前分蘖的生长。根据中国农业科学院农田灌溉研究所观测结果，早浇返青水能有效地促进麦株早期恢复生长。当然，返青水什么时候浇，单纯从时间早晚来说是不好判断的，还要根据当时土壤水分、水的温度、土壤质地以及麦苗生长情况而定。
    在早春管理方面，除适时、适量供应肥水之外，一般丰产田还要有效地运用镇压、深中耕等促进和控制相结合的措施。关于镇压效果，根据浙江省农业科学院试验结果，镇压后植株生长健壮，株高及基部节间长度缩短，茎粗增加，穗部性状改善，因而较未镇压者增产12.2％。镇压后也显著改变了茎秆组织的结构，如机械组织的厚度、细胞壁厚度及维管束数目均增加，因此，有利于增强小麦植株的抗倒伏性。中国农业科学院偃师基点在岳滩大队试验结果，早春（3月1日）镇压后植株高矮一致，穗子大小较整齐，单株成穗数增加，每亩穗数也相应加多。
    深中耕能促进新根发生和伸长，幼苗粗壮，根系发达，并有防倒伏作用，连续进行深中耕（三次是年前一次，年后二次；四次是年前、年后各二次），能有效地控制小麦植株生长。浙江省农业科学院于1月4日和2月5日两次进行深中耕后调查，看出麦株节间短、茎秆粗、生长健壮。
    拔节关：小麦拔节标志着营养生长进入旺盛时期，生殖生长已经开始。这时幼穗正在分化小花，茎基部节间正在迅速伸长，叶片分化接近完成，需要供应充足的水分和养分，以便随着气温增高，植株迅速增长之后，达到最大叶面积系数，通过光合作用的增强，积累大量的碳水化合物，提高成穗率并增加每穗结实粒数。此时主要矛盾表现在营养生长和生殖生长方面，主蘖生长和分蘖生长方面。在群体最大发展的前提下，部分弱蘖、小蘖由于养分、光线不足开始死亡，形成自然稀疏调节个体发育现象来促进群体的发展，以保证主茎和部分分蘖顺利进行穗部分化和发育。为了实现这一时期的群体的合理结构，既要求供应充足的养分和水分，增强营养生长，争取主茎和部分分蘖成穗，以达到一定的穗数和粒数；同时又要适当控制最大叶面积系数不要超过“七”，以防止茎秆徒长倒伏。
    从许多试验资料看来，拔节时期及时施肥、灌水有着显著增产作用，例如河北藁城县毛庄小麦丰产方试验结果，同样一斤纯氮素肥料，在冬前施平均增产十点四斤；返青施增产十三点二斤，拔节期施增产十五点四斤，孕穗期施增产七点三斤；四川乐至县劳动模范黄继全提出小麦施肥要先淡（分蘖期）、后浓（拔节期）。从各地进行小麦不同生育期需肥规律的研究结果来看，拔节期小麦吸收肥料量达到最高峰。这都充分说明及时追施拔节肥的重要。从水分条件来说，拔节期是小麦对水分反应最敏感的时期，如果水分供应不足，直接影响穗部正常发育，使退化小穗数和小花数增加。适时浇拔节水有利于养分向穗部运转，而促使小穗花的发育，增加结实小穗数和粒数。根据北京农业大学测定结果，4月12日适期浇拔节水的在4月16日测验穗部养分，相当于未浇拔节水的二点五六倍，适期浇拔节水的较晚浇拔节水的平均每穗增加二点一到三点六粒。江苏徐州敬安人民公社调查，在今年干旱情况下，浇拔节水比未浇拔节水的每穗粒数增加八点八粒，退化小穗减少11％。
    如何掌握时机，既能满足穗粒发育的肥水需要，又能控制茎叶不致旺长倒伏，这成为能否获得高额产量的关键。河南偃师县翟镇公社全国劳动模范刘应祥同志，针对拔节期麦苗生育情况，提出三个生动的形象，来表现不同的苗情，根据苗情采取三种相应的措施：
    猪耳朵型（过旺苗）叶色黑绿，叶片宽大，柔软下垂，严重郁蔽，不宜再施氮肥，应控制浇水而补施磷、钾肥。
    驴耳朵型（壮苗）叶较长而色青绿，生长健壮正常，叶尖微斜，是正常壮苗，但如管理不善，会向两头转化，应施少量氮肥、适量浇水配合施用磷、钾肥。
    马耳朵型（瘦苗）叶色浅绿，叶片狭小直立，表现缺肥，应大量施用氮肥和浇水。
    中国农业科学院偃师基点针对刘应祥同志所提出的三种形象植株进行测定的结果，证明可作为看苗管理的形态指标。
    拔节初期进行蹲苗，适当控制中部叶片生长，保持合理的叶面积，使苗壮而不旺，长慢长粗，是获得穗大、粒多而不倒伏的保证。但必须指出，所谓蹲苗，是在壮苗的基础上合理地运用肥、水，在一短暂时间内节制肥、水供应，调节营养生长和幼穗发育之间的矛盾，控制茎基部第一、二节间的徒长和中部叶片的旺长，以及主茎和分蘖生长的对比速度，使养分更多地供给幼穗发育，保证每一植株在合理的群体结构下得到更健壮的发育。绝不能控制肥水过分，以致影响穗部的正常分化，造成减产。控制措施表面看来虽属抑制麦苗生长，但实际是为了促进穗部，所以控制实际也是促进。
                      增　粒　增　重
    孕穗关：小麦进入孕穗期以后，叶片生长较缓，剑叶和顶部第二、三叶片达到最大伸长，营养生长已接近尾声。在生殖生长方面，小穗数目虽定，但养分首先保证供应幼穗中部和小穗的第一、二花。当养分不足时，穗顶部和基部的小穗与第三花以上的小花常不能结实，这一时期若能供应充分的养料、水分和保证光照条件，可以减少不孕小穗和提高结实粒数。根据以往研究资料，60％以上的子粒干物重靠抽穗以后继续进行光合作用而合成，从今年高产田的情况来看，在孕穗、抽穗时期继续供应适量养料和水分，促进剑叶和顶部第二、三叶片（一般称功能叶片）生长，后期保持较大叶面积并保持较长时期的生活力，可以提高生长后期的光合效率，更多地制造和积累营养物质，增加子粒数及其饱满度。
    灌浆关：小麦开始灌浆以后，除了继续进行光合作用制造养分供应穗部子粒灌浆之外，原来储存在叶片、叶梢和茎部的营养物质转运穗部，因此，保证生长后期有充足的水分，充分发挥叶片光合作用能力，加速营养物质向穗部运转，对增加子粒饱满度有着重要作用。但在北方麦区小麦灌浆期间一般多风，加以这时茎秆支持力减弱、穗部加重，浇水时容易引起倒伏。今年许多高产田在这一时期的管理上，紧密根据气象情况，乘无风和风小的时间当机立断，及时浇灌浆水和攻籽水，做到了丰产不倒。此外，在抽穗、灌浆期根外追施氮、磷肥以及硼、锰等微量元素，有利于灌浆成粒。今年大量事实证明，加强后期管理，对增粒、增重有着极其重要的作用。
