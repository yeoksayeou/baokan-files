Being a good squad and team leader
　　Production squads and teams are the grassroots fighting units of factories and mines. The Party's policies and guidelines need to be implemented by squads and teams, the enterprise's production plans and various tasks need to be realized by squads and teams, and the mass labor emulation campaign also needs to be carried out in depth with squads and teams as units. Therefore, doing a good job in leading squads and teams is becoming increasingly important in the movement to increase production and practice economy.
　　How to do a good job in leading squads and teams, how to be a good squad or team leader, and lead the entire squad to outstandingly complete and overfulfill the state plan and the plan to increase production and practice economy? There are outstanding creations and successful experiences on all fronts. The coal mining squad led by Li Wenge, the squad leader of the Sixth Coal Mining Section of the Fuxin Ping'an Mine, published in this newspaper today, is an excellent red banner on the coal production front. Since 1958, Li Wenge's coal mining squad has overfulfilled the coal production task every month. In two and a half years, they have overproduced more than 40,000 tons of coal for the country, which is equivalent to completing three years and two months of work. The attainment of such outstanding results is of course due to the collective efforts of all the coal miners in the squad, but it is mainly the result of the squad leader participating in production, leading production, and giving full play to the enthusiasm of each worker.
　　A deep understanding of the reality of production is an important prerequisite for doing a good job in squads and teams. Generally speaking, squad and team leaders in enterprises are always more familiar with and understand the reality of production. Because their work positions are on the front line of production, and the problems that occur on the front line must be solved by the squad and team leaders immediately. However, this does not mean that everyone working on the front line has a comprehensive and in-depth understanding of the actual situation of production. Due to the different working methods and depths of various squad and team leaders, the mastery of the situation is also different. Some people achieve a deep understanding, some people can only have a superficial understanding, and perhaps there are also a few people who still have a partial misunderstanding. One of the biggest features of Li Wenge's leadership is his deep understanding of the reality of production. Wherever there are difficulties in the production process, he goes there; wherever the key is, he takes the lead in working there; if any worker has any ideological troubles or specific problems that cannot be solved, he takes the initiative to help the worker solve ideological and specific problems, so that the whole squad is united like one person, and rushes forward towards one goal.
　　A thorough and down-to-earth work style is inseparable from a high degree of political consciousness. From the day Li Wenge became the squad leader, he has made strict demands on his own work, requiring himself to be familiar with production knowledge, to understand more than others, and to do better. And he insists on participating in underground labor with the workers. Every day, he goes down the well before the workers and goes up the well later. When the workers arrive at the well, he has already inspected the five mountain roads, the three disc plates, and various machines. When the closing time arrives, he is still preparing production conditions for the next shift. If it were not for a high degree of political consciousness as the driving force, how could there be such a great enthusiasm for this thorough and down-to-earth style, this spirit of burying oneself in hard work, and this perseverance in participating in production and leading production?
　　Comrades in charge of squads and teams in factories and mines, conscientiously study Li Wenge's high political awareness and responsible spirit, and be good squad and team leaders like Li Wenge.

### 当好班、组长

    当好班、组长
    生产班、组，是厂矿企业的基层战斗单位。党的政策方针需要班、组来贯彻，企业的生产计划和各项工作需要班、组来实现，群众性的劳动竞赛也要以班、组为单位来深入开展，因此，做好班、组领导工作，在增产节约运动中愈来愈显得重要了。
    怎样做好班、组领导工作，怎样当好班、组长，带领全班人马，出色地完成和超额完成国家计划和增产节约计划？各个战线上都有出色的创造和成功的经验，今天本报刊登的阜新平安矿第六采煤段李文阁班长领导的采煤班，就是煤炭生产战线上的一面优秀红旗。李文阁采煤班从1958年以来，月月超额完成煤炭生产任务，他们在两年半的时间里，为国家超额生产四万多吨煤炭，等于完成了三年零两个月的工作量。这样出色成绩的获得，固然由于全班采煤工人的集体努力，但主要是由于班长参加生产，领导生产，发挥了每个工人积极性的结果。
    对生产实际的深知深解，是做好班、组工作的重要前提。一般说来，企业中的班长组长对于生产实际总是比较熟悉、比较了解的。因为他们的工作岗位就在生产第一线，第一线上发生的问题马上就要班、组长解决。但是，这不等于说，所有工作在第一线的人对于生产实际的情况都了解得很全面很深入。由于各个班、组长的工作方法和工作深度不同，对于情况的掌握也就各不相同。有些人做到深知深解，有的人只能半知半解，另外，也许有个别的人还是半知不解。李文阁班长领导工作最大特点之一就是对生产实际深知深解。生产过程中哪里有困难就到哪里去，哪里是关键就在哪里带头干，工人中哪个有什么思想苦恼和具体问题不能解决就主动地帮助工人解决思想和具体问题，使全班上下团结得像一个人一样，一个劲儿朝着一个目标奋勇向前。
    深入踏实的工作作风，是同政治上的高度自觉分不开的，李文阁从当班长的一天起，就对自己的工作提出了严格的要求，要求熟悉生产知识，比别人懂得更多，干得更好。并且坚持同工人一起参加井下劳动。每天，他比工人先下井、后上井。当工人到井下的时候，他已经把五条上山道、三个片盘以及各种机械检查一遍了，下班时间到了，他还在为下一班准备生产条件。这种深入踏实的作风，这种埋头苦干的精神，这种坚持参加生产领导生产的毅力，如果不是高度的政治自觉作为动力，又怎会有这么大的干劲呢？
    各工厂矿山企业的班、组领导同志们，认真学习李文阁这种高度政治觉悟和负责精神，像李文阁那样当好班、组长。
