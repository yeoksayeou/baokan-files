    Only in Unintentionality and Intentionality
    By Our Staff Reporter Zhang Shikǎi
    
    Starting from Serving Agriculture
    More than a year ago, on the southern bank of the Pengjiang River, next to a desolate, dilapidated temple, there was a temporary factory built with a thatched shed. Inside the house were several stoves made of adobe bricks, along with dozens of small coal stoves and small earthenware pots used by small households for boiling water and cooking. This was the predecessor of the Jiangmen City Chemical and Agricultural Pesticide Factory in the Foshan Special District of Guangdong Province. At that time, this factory could only process things like gypsum powder, anhydrous alcohol, iodine, and red mercury. But more than a year later, the desolate and scattered traces of the past can no longer be seen here. What appears before people is a chemical plant with various equipment and a series of factory buildings, with workshops for pesticides, agricultural fertilizers, sulfuric acid, caustic soda, gunpowder, and oil refining, as well as various crisscrossing pipelines. The various pesticides produced here have not only played a significant role in supporting local agricultural production, but are also selling well throughout the province.
    
    Such a big change in less than two years, in the words of the factory director, "relies on starting from serving agriculture."
    
    First Overcome the "Roadblock"
    In the autumn of 1958, the factory began to produce pesticides in large quantities. However, the pesticide produced, jar after jar, can after can, always stayed in the warehouse. Some people suspected, "Now that various rural areas are vigorously developing indigenous pesticide production, who will want the pesticides we produce?"
    
    The products could not be sold, and everyone was anxious about this matter. Did the countryside not need pesticides? Or was there another reason? In order to solve this mystery, factory director Li Qin and several salesmen packed their bedding, brought a batch of pesticides, and went to the countryside to visit people. Old Li returned to his hometown—Waihai Commune in Xinhui County. The peasant brothers welcomed their vigorous production of pesticides to support agricultural production. But when it came to quality, some people said, "Ah Qin, look, the pest infestation is very serious now, and the labor force is strained. We originally relied on your pesticides to be useful, but who knew they couldn't kill the pests! You should go back and study it again!"
    
    This criticism from the peasants made Director Li realize the reason why the products could not be sold. As soon as he returned to the factory, he immediately mobilized the workers to carry out extensive airing of views and debates. After the masses' inspection, the reason for the poor product quality was not only due to the lack of technical experience in developing new products, but more importantly, they were still half-hearted about serving agricultural production. They did not understand the urgent needs of the peasant brothers, so they did not seriously think about ensuring quality.
    
    The ideological knot was untied, and the workers' enthusiasm also increased. Although technical skills and experience were still very lacking, in order to produce high-quality and efficient pesticides for the countryside, the workers continued to humbly learn, work hard, and study, consult with peasant brothers and workers in fraternal factories, and consult with books. Finally, they trial-produced many kinds of pesticide formulas, sent them to peasants in the neighboring four townships for trial use, solicited opinions, and sent technicians to the countryside to conduct on-the-spot experiments and appraisals with the peasants, constantly summarizing and improving, and the quality of the products gradually improved. Immediately afterwards, an efficient pesticide with the brand name "Thunderstorm" was mass-produced in this factory.
    
    "Losing Money" Business Should Be Done
    After passing the quality hurdle, pesticide production greatly developed. However, this was not equivalent to truly establishing the idea of serving agricultural production.
    
    At the beginning of 1959, the factory received a large number of processing tasks for pesticide 666 powder. According to the regulations of the higher authorities, the processing fee per ton was sixty-eight yuan. However, due to their relatively backward production technology, the actual cost was more than one hundred and ten yuan.
    
    "This is terrible!" At that time, some leading cadres in the factory also began to waver in their thinking, feeling that doing this loss-making business was really "bad luck"! Coincidentally, at this time, a unit in the province wanted to find them to process a batch of pigments. Processing pigments had low costs, high output value, and high profits. This made the thinking of some people who were not very willing to serve agriculture even more wavering.
    
    Is the purpose of pesticide factory production to meet the needs of agricultural production leaps forward, or to pursue output value and profit? This was a sharp question facing all the workers at that time. Under the leadership of the factory's Party branch, discussions were carried out within the Party, exposing and criticizing the capitalist management thinking of being half-hearted in serving agricultural production and blindly pursuing profits. The whole factory carried out a major inspection of the reasons for the losses, and found that the main reason for the losses was that the production technology was backward, and the problem of raw materials was not solved locally, resulting in low production efficiency, high raw material costs, and work stoppages due to waiting for materials. The workers put forward more than 200 rationalization proposals and launched a technical innovation and technical revolution movement. As a result, the average daily output per person increased from less than one hundred kilograms to more than three hundred and twenty kilograms. At the same time, according to the characteristics of chemical production, comprehensive utilization was carried out on a large scale, giving full play to the potential of equipment and raw materials, so that the products greatly increased. In 1959, not only was the product and output value plan completed, but also more than 100,000 yuan of construction funds were accumulated for the country, and it gloriously attended the city-wide and special district-wide hero meetings.
    
    Taking the Road of Self-Reliance
    With the development of agricultural production, the need for pesticides is increasing, and the quality requirements have also increased. However, the main raw materials for the "Thunderstorm" and "Double Nine" high-efficiency pesticides produced by this factory have to rely on imports from foreign countries, which seriously hinders the further development of production. The factory receives many letters and telegrams from inside and outside the province every day asking for goods, but production cannot meet these requirements. Could it be said that we can open our mouths and shout about difficulties, and sit and wait for the higher authorities to help solve them? At this time, it was precisely when the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party put forward the call to "oppose rightism, boost morale, and vigorously carry out the movement to increase production and practice economy." The workers of this factory chose a correct path—self-reliance. On the one hand, actively looking for ways to save and substitute, and expand the source of raw materials; on the other hand, thinking of ways to produce raw materials themselves. This is really not easy for a "poor stick" factory that was just reorganized from a handicraft cooperative less than a year ago and lacks funds, technology, and equipment! For example, to produce sulfuric acid, it would cost two or three thousand yuan to build a sulfuric acid tower. Where did this factory get so much money! So, they thought of ways to use pottery jars and pottery pipes to make indigenous equipment. At that time, the workers' enthusiasm was really high. No matter day or night, workers who were off work flocked to the construction site to help, as if they were going to a fair. The furnace was built, but it didn't work, so they tore it down and rebuilt it; if it still didn't work, they tore it down and rebuilt it again; the furnace was rebuilt almost a hundred times, but it still couldn't produce sulfuric acid. The workers who built the furnace gradually became discouraged. Just then, a group of new forces suddenly came to the construction site to fight alongside the workers. They were: the secretary of the municipal party committee, the mayor, the director of the chemical industry bureau, and comrades from the Jiangmen City Science Committee. This greatly encouraged the workers. With the support of higher authorities and the help of all parties, after more than a hundred failures, the furnace was finally built, and sulfuric acid flowed out smoothly. At first, it could only produce a few hundred kilograms of so-called "sulfurous acid" with very low quality every day. After the workers' persistent efforts, it has gradually increased to more than 1,200 kilograms per day, and the quality has also reached national standards.
    
    The substitute raw materials necessary for the production of "Thunderstorm" brand pesticides have also been successfully extracted from coal tar through the efforts of the workers, overcoming various difficulties.
    
    Forging Ahead
    There is never an end to the road of progress. In the first half of the year, the factory's main product—pesticides—had completed the annual production plan ahead of schedule by half a year. In addition, it has produced a large number of chemical fertilizers, gunpowder, diesel and other more than 30 products serving agricultural production. The quality of all products meets the standards stipulated by the state.
    
    Recently, under the guidance of the idea of taking agriculture as the foundation, they have further revised the original production plan, and the output of various products will be greatly increased. Undoubtedly, they will surely ride the wind and waves and advance at high speed on the broad road of serving agriculture.

    只在无心与有心

    为农业服务起家
    一年多以前，在蓬江南岸，在一间荒凉的破庙旁，有一间草棚搭的临时厂房。房子里有用土坯砌起的几台炉灶，加上几十个小户人家烧茶、煮饭用的小煤炉和小瓦锅。这就是广东佛山专区江门市化工农药厂的前身。那时，这个工厂只能加工一些石膏粉、无水酒精、碘酒和红汞之类的东西。可是一年多以后，这里再也看不到当时荒凉零落的痕迹了。出现在人们眼前的，是一座有各种设备和一片厂房的化工厂，里面排列着农药、农肥、硫酸、烧碱、火药、炼油等车间，和纵横交错的各种管道。这里出产的各种农药，不仅对支援当地农业生产发挥了很大作用，而且畅销全省。
    不到两年的时间，有这么大的变化，用这个厂厂长的话来说：“是靠为农业服务起家的。”
    先降“拦路虎”
    1958年秋，这个厂开始大量生产农药。可是，制出来的一坛坛、一罐罐的农药，总是呆在仓库里。有人怀疑说：“现在农村各地都在大搞土农药生产，我们生产出来的农药还有谁要呢？”
    产品销不出去，大家都为这事着急。是否农村不需要农药？还是另有原因？为了解开这个谜，厂长李钦和几个供销员，卷起被包，带上一批农药，分头下乡访问去了。老李回到他的家乡——新会县外海公社。农民兄弟对他们大力生产农药支援农业生产，表示欢迎。但一谈到质量，有的人就说：“阿钦，你看，现在虫害很严重，劳动力又紧张，我们原来都一心指望你们的农药有用，谁知却是杀不死虫的！你们还是回去再研究一下吧！”
    农民的这一批评，使李厂长知道了产品销不出去的原因。他一回到工厂，就立即发动职工开展大鸣大放，经过群众的检查，原来产品质量不好的原因，固然是由于搞新产品缺乏技术经验，但更重要的还在于对为农业生产服务还有点半心半意，没有体会到农民兄弟的迫切需要，所以就没有认真想法保证质量。
    思想的疙瘩解开了，职工们的劲头也就大起来了。尽管技术、经验仍很缺乏，但为了生产出质量好、效率高的农药供应农村，职工们不断虚心学习、努力钻研，向农民兄弟和兄弟厂的工人请教，向书本请教，终于试制出许多种不同配方的农药，分送给邻近四乡的农民试用，征求意见，派技术员下乡和农民一起进行实地试验、鉴定，不断总结、改进，产品的质量逐步提高了。紧接着，一种“雷雨”牌的高效农药在这个厂里大批生产出来了。
    “亏本生意”应该做
    闯过了质量关，农药生产大大发展了。但是，这还不等于真正确立了为农业生产服务的思想。
    1959年初，这个厂接到大量生产农药六六六粉的加工任务。按上级规定，每吨的加工费用六十八元。但是，由于他们的生产技术比较落后，所花的实际费用却要一百一十多元。
    “这还了得！”当时，厂里一部分领导干部，思想上也动摇起来了，觉得要做这个亏本生意，真是“倒了大霉”！碰巧这时省里有个单位想找他们加工一批颜料。加工颜料成本低、产值高、利润厚。这就惹得一些不很愿意为农业服务的人思想上更加动摇起来。
    究竟农药厂生产的目的是为了满足农业生产跃进的需要，还是为了追求产值、利润呢？这是当时摆在全体职工面前的一个尖锐问题。在厂党支部的领导下，党内开展了讨论，揭发和批判了那种半心半意为农业生产服务和盲目追求利润的资本主义经营思想，全厂开展了关于亏本原因的大检查，发觉亏本的主要原因在于生产技术落后，不是就地取材解决原料问题，因而造成生产效率低、原材料成本高和停工待料等现象。职工们提出了两百多条合理化建议，开展了技术革新和技术革命运动。结果，每人平均日产量由不到一百公斤提高到三百二十多公斤。与此同时，又根据化工生产的特点，大搞综合利用，充分发挥设备和原料潜力，使产品大大增加。1959年不仅完成了产品、产值计划，还为国家积累了十万多元建设资金，光荣地出席了全市、全专区的群英会。
    走自力更生的道路
    随着农业生产的发展，对农药的需要越来越多，质量要求也提高了，但是，这个厂生产的“雷雨”、“孖九”等高效农药，主要原料却要依靠从外国进口，这就严重地妨碍了生产的进一步发展。厂里天天收到不少从省内、省外发来的要货函电，而生产却不能满足这些要求。难道说可以张着嘴巴光喊叫困难，伸手坐待上级来帮助解决吗？这时，正是党的八届八中全会提出了“反右倾、鼓干劲，厉行增产节约运动”的号召的时候。这个厂的职工们选择了一条正确的道路——自力更生。一方面，积极寻找节约、代用的办法，扩大原料来源；另一方面，自己想办法生产原料。这对于一个刚由手工业社改组过来还不到一年，资金、技术、设备等都很缺乏的“穷棒子”厂来说，真是不容易！譬如生产硫酸，建一套硫酸塔就要两、三万元。这个厂那里来这许多钱呢！于是，他们就想办法，利用陶缸、陶管来搞土设备。那时候，职工们的干劲真是高极了，不论白天黑夜，下了班的工人，都像赶集一样涌到工地来帮忙。炉子建好了，不行，拆掉再修；再不行，又再拆再修；炉子反复修建了差不多上百次，还始终生产不出硫酸来。建炉的职工们渐渐有些泄气了。正在这时，工地上却忽然来了一批生力军，和职工们一起并肩作战。他们是：市委书记、市长、化工局长和江门市科学委员会的同志。这使职工们受到很大的鼓舞，在上级支持和各方面的帮助下，经过一百多次失败，炉子终于建成，顺利流出了硫酸。开头，每日只能产一百几十斤、质量很低的所谓“亚硫酸”，经过职工们坚持不懈的努力，已逐步提高到日产一千二百多公斤，质量也达到国家标准。
    生产“雷雨”牌农药所必需的代用原料，经过职工们的努力，克服了种种困难，也从煤焦油中提炼成功。
    破浪前进
    前进的道路是永远没有止境的。上半年，这个厂的主要产品——农药，已提前半年超额完成了全年生产计划。另外，生产了大量化学肥料、火药、柴油等三十多种为农业生产服务的产品。各项产品的质量也都符合国家规定的标准。
    最近，在以农业为基础的思想指导下，他们又进一步修改了原来的生产计划，各项产品的产量都要大大增加。无疑的，他们一定会在为农业服务的康庄大道上，乘风破浪，高速前进。
