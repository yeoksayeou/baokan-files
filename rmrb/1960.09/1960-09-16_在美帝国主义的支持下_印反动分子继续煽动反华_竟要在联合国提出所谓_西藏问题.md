Xinhua News Agency, September 14th: According to a New Delhi dispatch from the Indian Press Trust, Narayan, the chairman of the notorious so-called "Asian-African Council on Tibet," an anti-China vanguard in India, announced in New Delhi on September 10th that this organization had decided to send a two-person "delegation" to the United Nations to raise the so-called "Tibet question" at the upcoming United Nations General Assembly. This is a conspiracy by the United States and a small number of its lackeys to once again interfere in China's internal affairs, incite anti-China sentiment internationally, and poison the international atmosphere.

This "Asian-African Council on Tibet" is a standing body of the farce—the so-called "Asian-African Conference on Tibet and Anti-Colonialism"—staged under the direction of the United States by a small group of notorious reactionaries in India on the eve of Premier Zhou Enlai's visit to India in April of this year. The purpose of staging this "farce" at that time was to conspire to obstruct the settlement of boundary issues between China and India through friendly consultation and to interfere in China's internal affairs. According to Narayan's announcement at a press conference, the two Indians being sent to the United Nations are Trilokandas, chairman of the "International Commission of Jurists," a non-governmental organization with consultative status at the United Nations and a reactionary lawyer, and Jay J. Singh, former chairman of the "India-America League."

Corresponding to the above conspiracy is the "report" on "Tibet and the People's Republic of China," 340 pages long, issued by the "International Commission of Jurists" on August 7th of this year. (This commission had previously produced a "report" slandering Hungary after the counter-revolutionary rebellion in Hungary in 1956.) Because this "report" slandering China goes to extremes of libel and rumor-mongering, grossly interfering in China's internal affairs, it has been praised by the US State Department. The day after the publication of this "report," which they colluded to fabricate, White, a press officer of the US State Department, described it at a press conference as "proving the shocking atrocities committed by the Communists against the Tibetan people."

At the same time, Indian anti-China schemers are also actively seeking accomplices to discuss the so-called "Tibet question" at the United Nations. Trilokandas flew to Kuala Lumpur on August 15th. According to Agence France-Presse, he came specifically to "discuss the Tibet issue" with Malayan Prime Minister Rahman. On August 16th, the Malayan Ministry of Foreign Affairs declared that it had instructed the Malayan delegation to the United Nations to raise the so-called "Tibet question" at the upcoming United Nations General Assembly.

According to a report by the Indian Press Trust on August 6th, Mehta, chairman of the Indian Praja Socialist Party, recently submitted a so-called "memorandum on the Tibet issue" to Narasimhan, Under-Secretary for Special Political Affairs of the United Nations. This "memorandum" was submitted by the so-called "Asian-African Council on Tibet."

The news agency also said that this "council" is in contact with certain member states of the United Nations in order to raise the so-called "Tibet question" at the United Nations General Assembly in September.

### 在美帝国主义的支持下  印反动分子继续煽动反华  竟要在联合国提出所谓“西藏问题”

    在美帝国主义的支持下
    印反动分子继续煽动反华
    竟要在联合国提出所谓“西藏问题”
    新华社14日讯　据印度报业托辣斯新德里消息，印度反华急先锋、臭名远扬的所谓“亚非西藏会议理事会”的主席纳拉扬9月10日在新德里宣布：这个组织已经决定派出一个由两人组成的“代表团”前往联合国，向即将召开的联合国大会提出所谓“西藏问题”。这是美国及其一小批喽罗再次企图干涉中国内政，在国际上煽动反华，毒化国际气氛的阴谋。
    这个“亚非西藏会议理事会”，是今年4月周恩来总理访问印度前夕由印度一小撮臭名远扬的反动分子在美国导演下演出的丑剧——所谓“亚非西藏和反殖民主义会议”的一个常设机构，纳拉扬是这次“会议”的主席。当时上演这个“丑剧”的目的是阴谋阻挠中印两国通过友好协商解决边界问题，干涉中国内政。据纳拉扬在记者招待会上宣布，这次被派往联合国的两名印度人，一个是在联合国有咨询资格的非政府机构“国际法学家委员会”主席、反动律师特里孔达斯，一个是“印度美国联盟”的前主席杰·杰·辛格。
    同上述阴谋相呼应的是，“国际法学家委员会”在今年8月7日发表了一份长达三百四十页的所谓“西藏和中华人民共和国”的“报告”。（这个委员会早在1956年匈牙利反革命暴乱发生后就曾经制造过一份诬蔑匈牙利的“报告”。）由于这份诬蔑中国的“报告”极尽诽谤、造谣的能事，粗暴地干涉中国内政，曾经受到美国国务院的赞扬。在这份“报告”发表的第二天，美国国务院新闻官怀特就在记者招待会上把这份他们合谋编造的“报告”，说成是“证明了共产党人对西藏人民所犯令人震惊的暴行”。
    同时，印度的反华阴谋家们还四出活动，为在联合国讨论所谓“西藏问题”寻找同谋犯。特里孔达斯曾经在8月15日乘飞机到达吉隆坡。据法新社报道，他是特地来同马来亚联合邦总理拉赫曼“讨论西藏问题”的。8月16日，马来亚联合邦外交部宣称，它已指示马来亚联合邦驻联合国代表团向即将举行的联合国大会提出所谓“西藏问题”。
    据印度报业托辣斯8月6日报道，印度人民社会党主席梅达最近曾向联合国负责特别政治事务的副秘书长纳拉西姆汉提出了一份所谓“西藏问题备忘录”。这个“备忘录”是所谓“亚非西藏会议理事会”提出的。
    这家通讯社还说，这个“理事会”正在同联合国的某些会员国进行联系，以便在9月份联合国大会上提出所谓“西藏问题”。
