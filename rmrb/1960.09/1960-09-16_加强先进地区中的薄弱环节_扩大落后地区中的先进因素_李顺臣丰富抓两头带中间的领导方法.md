Strengthen Weak Links in Advanced Areas; Expand Advanced Factors in Backward Areas
Li Shunchen Enriches the Leadership Method of Grasping Both Ends and Bringing Along the Middle

In the Bijie area of Guizhou, everyone knows that Comrade Li Shunchen, member of the CPC Bijie Prefectural Committee, secretary of the Nayong County Party Committee Secretariat, and county head, is an outstanding cadre. This Miao cadre, who came from a hired peasant background, has consistently maintained the identity of an ordinary laborer for ten years, always insisting on participating in production to lead production, and has established very close ties with the broad masses. Comrade Li Shunchen not only has a good work style, but also pays close attention to implementing the set of scientific and meticulous work methods instructed by the Party and Chairman Mao. In applying the Marxist-Leninist leadership method of grasping both ends and bringing along the middle, he has explored some new experiences. In order to grasp the "two ends" even better, he pays attention to grasping the weak links in advanced areas while establishing advanced examples; while helping backward areas find problems in their work, he also pays attention to grasping the advanced factors in backward areas. In this way, advanced areas can continue to move forward without falling behind due to pride and complacency; backward areas will enhance their confidence and catch up with the advanced quickly. A thorough and down-to-earth work style, coupled with scientific and meticulous work methods, enables Li Shunchen to complete the tasks assigned to him by the Party relatively well. Now, Comrade Li Shunchen has been established by the Bijie Prefectural Committee as a model cadre for the entire region, and people are learning from him.

In May of this year, Comrade Li Shunchen came to the red flag commune of the county—the Gu’kai Commune. The production and livelihood of this commune are well arranged. The fields are fully planted and transplanted, with no empty fields or land to be seen. The mess halls have a solid foundation, with vegetable gardens full and chickens and ducks in abundance. The enthusiasm of the commune members is very high. Therefore, the commune leaders believe that their work has been done almost perfectly. When Comrade Li Shunchen saw this situation, although he felt that the work here was indeed done well, he felt that the "almost perfect" thinking of the commune cadres was a dangerous state of mind. If it was not overcome in time, this advanced commune was likely to stagnate or even fall behind. Was it really "almost perfect"? He went deep into the area and spent five or six days inspecting more than a dozen production teams. The result of the inspection revealed that the cadres and masses here had a very good spirit of hard work, but were relatively poor at working cleverly. Taking the tool reform of the mess halls as an example, out of the two hundred and twenty-seven mess halls, only the Fako mess hall in the F窝 Management District used ox power to grind flour, requiring only one auxiliary labor force to manage it and provide food for more than 400 people; other mess halls used manual labor to push the mill, with each mess hall using three to five people, occupying more than 900 laborers. This was very unfavorable for concentrating the main labor force to strengthen the front line of production. In addition, he also found that although this commune had established many livestock farms, the feeding and management work was not done well, and most of the pigs were thin and weak. He presented these situations to the commune leaders and calculated the labor cost of grinding flour in the mess halls. Everyone was shocked and realized that there were indeed problems in their work that could not be ignored. Then, a field meeting was held to vigorously promote the advanced methods of the Fako mess hall and to vigorously carry out tool reform. In just over a month, more than 100 mess halls in the entire commune had implemented animal-powered grinding, freeing up 210 laborers to strengthen the front line of agricultural production, making production even better. Measures were also taken for the livestock farms, establishing a responsibility system and strengthening feeding management, and the growth of the pigs quickly improved.

Comrade Li Shunchen not only affirmed achievements and looked for problems in advanced areas to prevent pride and complacency and promote advancement, but also looked for advanced factors in backward areas, pointed out directions for local cadres, encouraged their enthusiasm, and prompted them to catch up with confidence. In June of this year, when the county's rush planting and sowing was basically completed, the Huazuo Management District of the Longchang Commune had more than 2,000 mu of land that had not been planted with crops, which was obviously far behind other management districts and had a great impact on the commune's increased production. When Comrade Li Shunchen saw this backward phenomenon, he did not simply criticize the cadres below. In order to help this management district catch up quickly, he traveled across mountains and rivers, walking through all eight production teams within dozens of miles of the entire management district, working and studying with the commune members. He finally found the reasons for the lagging rush planting and sowing, mainly the management district and production teams were randomly allocating fields, randomly allocating labor, and the livelihood was not well arranged. However, when he finally arrived at the Ledu Production Team, 20 miles away from the management district, it was a different scene: all 346 mu of land in the entire team had been planted, and the commune members had already begun weeding the cornfields for the first time. What was the reason for this? It turned out that the "four fixings" of this team were done well, and there were specific and reasonable regulations on the time, quality, and remuneration for completing tasks. Therefore, the commune members were very enthusiastic, production was well organized, and the planting work was ahead of other teams. Comrade Li Shunchen immediately took this advanced experience back to the management district, held a meeting of cadres above the level of production team leader, introduced and promoted it, and called on everyone to learn from it. This incident gave the management district cadres a profound education. They not only consciously checked and corrected the shortcomings in their work, but also greatly increased their confidence because they found specific ways to improve their work. In just seven days, they led the masses to basically plant all the empty land, bringing the entire management district and the entire commune up to the speed of the county's rush planting and sowing.

On another occasion, when Comrade Li Shunchen came to the backward Weixin Commune, he found that the Dushan Management District had done a relatively good job in production, the livelihood was arranged solidly, the commune members were enthusiastic, and the cadre work style was also down-to-earth and thorough. He seized this typical example, talked about it wherever he went, and established a clear banner for the entire commune, setting off a competition upsurge in the entire commune to learn from the Dushan Management District. After more than two months, the face of this commune had undergone great changes. The Aoshu Management District of the Gu'kai Commune was the most backward management district in the entire commune. Li Yipin, deputy secretary of the commune party committee, was assigned to be responsible for this management district, but he thought that the masses here were "backward" and the work was difficult, so he was unwilling to go. Later, Comrade Li Shunchen went. He first came to the Guanzhai Production Team of this management district and found that although the main production of this team had fallen behind, the cattle were well fed, and the cadres were willing to work, but they lacked methods. He helped the cadres here to study ways to improve production and catch up with the advanced, and praised their advantages. The cadres were deeply moved and said: "We have not done a good job, and Secretary Li is still encouraging us. We must go all out to catch up with the advanced!" It rained heavily that night, and the cadres took the lead in braving the rain to fill the fields, and the enthusiasm of the commune members for production was high. The other teams in the management district were also motivated. As a result, the production progress of this management district was ahead of several other good management districts. Under the influence of Comrade Li Shunchen, Comrade Li Yipin, deputy secretary of the commune party committee, also moved to this management district to settle down. Comrade Li Shunchen's practical assistance to advanced and backward areas was also warmly welcomed by the masses. The masses once sang about him: "The county party secretary is a mother, leading us to create miracles, grasping the advanced in backward areas, and finding problems in advanced areas."

Li Shunchen's ability to apply the leadership method of grasping both ends and bringing along the middle in a detailed and concrete way is inseparable from his hardworking, simple, thorough, and long-term work style of persisting in the front line of agricultural production as an ordinary laborer, eating, living, working, and consulting with the masses. For ten years, he has braved dangers, waded through water, climbed mountains, and traveled to all ten communes and 87% of the production teams in the county. In recent years, he has especially loved to go to remote and backward areas. There is a Biaoshuiyan team in the Famu Management District of the Gu'kai Commune, where fifteen Miao households live in a deep mountain valley, sixty miles away from the management district, and you have to pass through a large mountain where tigers and leopards often appear to get there. Since 1957, no one from the district at that time or the current commune had ever been there. Comrade Li Shunchen walked to Famu and then came to Biaoshuiyan in the thick fog. The Miao commune members here welcomed him with singing and dancing. He helped arrange production and livelihood here, and also solved the problem of children's schooling. Wang Jingda, secretary of the commune party committee, said with emotion: "I used to think I was deep enough, but Secretary Li went to places that I hadn't been to in several years here." Now, this commune has strengthened its leadership over remote teams.

Comrade Li Shunchen, under the education and cultivation of the Party, has established a firm mass viewpoint and maintained very close ties with the masses. He always wears coarse cloth, straw sandals, and carries a hoe on his shoulder. He weeds and fertilizes in the fields and carries water and cooks in the mess hall. When he goes down to work, he takes care of everything related to the masses, checking both production and mess halls. If he finds that a commune member is sick, he asks for a doctor and medicine for them, and also goes to the mountains to collect herbs and personally washes their feet and treats leg diseases with local folk remedies. As soon as he arrives somewhere, commune members are willing to ask him for advice on anything. Often, as soon as one group leaves, another group comes. There was even such a thing: a girl named Yang Guoxiu even wanted to consult with County Head Li about her marriage. She asked County Head Li to help her understand the other party's situation. Although this was just a personal matter of a girl, Comrade Li Shunchen readily agreed and helped her understand the other party's situation responsibly. In 1958, when he was studying at the provincial cadre culture school, he received more than 300 letters from cadres below the level of production team leader and commune members in one year, talking to him about work and production. Precisely because he has close ties with the masses, he can hear opinions that others cannot hear and understand situations that others cannot understand. And when he listens to the opinions of commune members and cadres, he never just listens to them. He always goes to production to repeatedly understand the actual situation. Therefore, he can grasp the problems and experiences in production quickly and accurately. The cadres say that Secretary Li has three speeds: fast in discovering problems, fast in solving problems, and fast in action; and two accuracies: accurate in grasping problems and accurate in solving problems. At the same time, through long-term practice of participating in production and leading production, he has deeply realized that advanced and backward are not absolute. There are weak links in advanced areas, and there are advanced factors in backward areas. As long as you go deep down, you can find them, and he himself has done this. Therefore, he can find backward links in some advanced areas that local cadres have not found, and he can also find advanced experiences in some backward areas that local cadres have not found.

Comrade Li Shunchen, who came from a hired peasant background, has the great and noble class feelings of the working class. He feels heartache when he sees some advanced areas falling behind or backward areas not catching up. This feeling prompts him to enthusiastically help cadres and masses solve difficulties, help backward areas catch up with the advanced, and make advanced areas even more advanced. He does not believe that backward areas are all backward, nor does he believe that the cadres and masses in backward areas are willing to lag behind. Cadres in backward areas often have low confidence because they see too many unfavorable conditions in their areas, and they often lack working methods. After being labeled as "backward," they often cannot hold their heads up and are constrained in their work. Comrade Li Shunchen deeply understands their ideological situation and is very considerate of their feelings. Therefore, he does not simply point fingers and criticize the cadres in backward areas, but patiently educates them, and even first conducts self-criticism, reviewing that the comrades of the county party committee have not gone deep enough in their leadership of these areas, and provides concrete help at the same time. Therefore, the cadres in backward areas reflect that they feel comfortable when Secretary Li helps them with their work. Comrade Li Shunchen's work style and work methods are being widely learned by cadres at all levels in Nayong County. A commune party committee secretary said: "In the past, when I listened to cadres reporting on their work in backward areas, I would first criticize them. Now I have learned Secretary Li's method, patiently talking with them, discovering and praising the positive factors in the local area, and encouraging their confidence in moving forward."

    加强先进地区中的薄弱环节　扩大落后地区中的先进因素
    李顺臣丰富抓两头带中间的领导方法
    在贵州毕节地区，人们都知道中共毕节地委委员、纳雍县委书记处书记、县长李顺臣同志是一个优秀的干部。这位雇农出身的苗族干部，十年如一日始终保持着普通劳动者的身份，一直坚持参加生产领导生产，并与广大群众建立了十分密切的联系。李顺臣同志不但作风好，而且很注意贯彻执行党和毛主席所指示的一套科学、细致的工作方法。他在运用抓两头带中间的马克思列宁主义的领导方法中，摸索出一些新经验，为了把“两头”抓得更好，他在树立先进榜样的同时，还注意抓先进地区的薄弱环节；在帮助落后地区找寻工作中问题的同时，又注意抓落后地区的先进因素。这样，先进地区就能继续前进，不因骄傲自满而掉队；落后地区则增强信心，迅速赶上先进。深入踏实的工作作风，加上科学细致的工作方法，就使得李顺臣能够比较出色地完成党交给他的任务。现在，李顺臣同志已被毕节地委树立为全区的干部标兵，人们都向他学习。
    今年5月，李顺臣同志来到全县的红旗公社——姑开公社。这个公社生产、生活都安排得好。田地间满栽满插，看不到一块空田空土。食堂家底雄厚，蔬菜满园，鸡鸭成群。社员们的劳动热情很高。因此，公社领导干部认为他们的工作已经做得差不多了。李顺臣同志看到这种情景，虽然觉得这里各项工作确实作得较好，但是，他感到公社干部的“差不多”思想，是一种危险的思想情绪，如不及时加以克服，这个工作先进的公社就很有可能停滞不前，甚至掉队。果真“差不多”了吗？他深入下去，用五、六天的时间，检查了十多个生产队。检查的结果，发现这里的干部群众苦干精神很好，巧干却比较差。拿食堂的工具改革来说，在二百二十七个食堂中，只有法窝管理区的法科食堂磨面是用牛力，只要一个辅助劳力管理，就能供给四百多人吃饭；其他食堂都是用人力推磨，每个食堂用三、五个人，就占用了九百多个劳力。这对集中主要劳力加强生产第一线是很不利的。另外，他还发现这个公社畜牧场办得虽多，但饲养管理工作做得不好，猪只大部分瘦弱。他将这些情况向公社领导干部摆了摆，而且算了下食堂磨面占用劳力的账。这一来，大家都吃一惊，认识到工作中确实存在着问题，不能忽视。接着便召开现场会议，大力推广法科食堂的先进办法，大搞工具改革。只一个多月，全社已有一百多个食堂实行畜力拉磨，腾出二百一十个劳力，加强了农业生产第一线，使生产搞得更好。对畜牧场也采取措施，建立了责任制，加强了饲养管理，猪的生长情况很快好转。
    李顺臣同志不仅在先进地区肯定成绩，寻找问题，防止骄傲自满，促使先进更先进；同时又在落后地区寻找先进因素，为当地干部指出方向，鼓舞干劲，促使他们信心百倍地赶上去。今年6月，当全县抢栽抢种基本结束时，龙场公社化作管理区却有两千多亩没有栽上庄稼，与其他管理区比较，显然是大大地落在后面，对全社增产有很大影响。李顺臣同志看到这种落后现象，不是对下面干部单纯地批评指责一通。为了帮助这个管理区迅速赶上来，他跋山涉水，走遍了全管理区方圆数十里的八个生产队，与社员同劳动同研究。他终于找出了抢栽抢种落后的原因，主要是管理区和生产队乱调拨田土、乱调配劳力、生活也安排得不好。但是，当他最后走到离管理区二十里的倮都生产队时，却是另一番景象：全队三百四十六亩田土，都已栽种结束，社员们已开始在玉米地里锄一遍草。这又是什么道理？原来这个队的“四固定”搞得好，而且对完成任务的时间、质量、报酬都有具体合理的规定。因此，社员情绪很高，生产搞得井井有条，栽种工作走在其他队的前面。李顺臣同志立即带着这个先进经验回到管理区，召开生产队长以上的干部会，加以介绍推广，号召大家学习。这件事使管理区干部受到一次深刻的教育，他们不但自觉地检查纠正了自己工作中的缺点，而且由于找到了改进工作的具体办法，信心大增。只七天时间，就领导群众将空田空地基本种完，使全管理区和全公社赶上了全县抢栽抢种的进度。
    又有一次，李顺臣同志来到工作落后的维新公社，发现独山管理区生产搞得比较好，生活安排得扎实，社员情绪高，干部作风也踏实、深入。他就抓住这个典型，走到哪里讲到哪里，给全公社树立起鲜明旗帜，全公社掀起了向独山管理区学习的竞赛热潮，两个多月后，这个公社的面貌就有了很大的改变。姑开公社的凹书管理区，是全社工作最落后的管理区。公社党委副书记李一品同志分工负责这个管理区，可是他认为这里群众“落后”，工作难办，不愿去。后来李顺臣同志去了。他首先来到这个管理区的官寨生产队，发现这个队的主要生产虽掉队，但耕牛喂得好，干部肯干，只是缺乏办法。他就帮助这里的干部研究搞好生产赶上先进的办法，并表扬他们的优点，干部深为感动，说：“我们工作没作好，李书记还鼓励我们，一定要鼓足干劲赶先进！”当天晚上下大雨，干部带头冒雨打田，社员生产情绪高涨，管理区的其他队也被带动起来，结果这个管理区的生产进度走在别的好几个管理区的前面。在李顺臣同志的影响下，公社党委副书记李一品同志也搬到这个管理区安家落户。李顺臣同志对先进地区和落后地区的这种切实帮助，也受到了群众热烈的欢迎。群众曾这样歌唱他：“县委书记是母亲，领导我们创奇迹，落后地区抓先进，先进地区找问题。”
    李顺臣所以能深入具体地运用抓两头带中间的领导方法，是与他工作作风艰苦朴素、踏实深入、长期以一个普通劳动者的姿态坚持在农业生产第一线、与群众同吃同住同劳动同商量分不开的。十年来，他不避艰险，涉水跋山，足迹遍及全县十个公社和全县87％的生产队。最近几年，他还特别爱去边远落后地区。姑开公社伐木管理区有个标水岩小队，十五户苗族住在一个深山沟里，距离管理区有六十里，必须穿过一座常有虎豹出没的大山才能走到。1957年以来，当时的区和现在的公社都没人去过。李顺臣同志步行到伐木，又顶着漫天大雾来到标水岩。这里的苗族社员载歌载舞地欢迎他。他在这里帮助安排了生产和生活，而且解决了子弟入学问题。公社党委书记王景达同志感动地说：“以前我认为自己够深入了，可是李书记到的地方，我在这里几年都没到过。”现在，这个公社已加强了对边远队的领导。
    李顺臣同志在党的培养教育下，树立了坚强的群众观点，与群众保持着十分密切的联系。他总是身穿麻布，脚登草鞋，肩背锄头，到田里到坡上，他就薅草淋粪，到食堂就挑水做饭。他下去工作，凡是与群众有关的事他都管，既检查生产，又检查食堂。发现社员生病，就为他们请医寻药，还亲自上山采草药，用当地土药方亲自给社员洗脚治腿病。他一到哪里，社员们无论有什么事都愿意来请教他，常常是刚走一伙，又来一帮。甚至发生过这样的事情：有个姑娘叫杨国秀，连自己的婚姻也要请教李县长，她要求李县长帮她了解对方的情况，这虽只是一个姑娘的个人私事，李顺臣同志还是满口答应，并且很负责地帮助她了解了对方情况。1958年他在省干部文化学校学习，一年间，就收到生产队长以下的干部和社员的信三百多封，向他谈工作和生产情况。正由于他与群众有着密切的联系，他就能听到别人听不到的意见，了解别人所了解不到的情况。而他在听取社员和干部的意见时，又从不一听就是，总要到生产中去反复了解实际情况。因此，生产中的问题和经验，他摸得既快又准。干部们都说李书记有三快：发现问题快，解决问题快，行动快；有两准：问题摸得准，解决问题准。同时，通过长期的参加生产领导生产的实践，他深深地体会到先进和落后不是绝对的，先进中有薄弱环节，落后中也有先进因素，只要深入下去，就可以发现，而他自己就是这样作的。因此，他既能在一些先进地区发现当地干部没有发现的落后环节，也能在一些落后地区发现当地干部没有发现的先进经验。
    雇农出身的李顺臣同志，有着工人阶级的伟大而崇高的阶级感情。他看到一些先进地区掉队，或落后地区赶不上来时，就感到心痛。这种感情促使他满腔热情地帮助干部和群众解决困难，帮助落后赶先进，先进更先进。他不相信落后地区样样都落后，也不相信落后地区的干部和群众自甘落后。落后地区的干部往往因为过多地看到本地区的不利条件，因而信心不高，他们也往往缺少工作办法。在戴上“落后”的帽子后，常常抬不起头，工作起来束手束脚。李顺臣同志深切理解他们的思想状况，十分体贴他们的这种心情。因此，他对落后地区的干部不是指手划脚地单纯指责，而是耐心地教育，甚至首先进行自我批评，检讨县委的同志对这些地区的领导不够深入，同时给以具体的帮助。因此，落后地区的干部反映，李书记帮助工作时，他们心情舒畅。李顺臣同志的这种工作作风和工作方法，正被纳雍县的各级干部广泛地学习着。一个公社党委书记说：“过去我对落后地区，听了干部汇报工作后，首先是批评一顿，现在学习了李书记的办法，耐心地同他们交谈，发现和表扬当地的积极因素，鼓舞他们前进的信心。”
