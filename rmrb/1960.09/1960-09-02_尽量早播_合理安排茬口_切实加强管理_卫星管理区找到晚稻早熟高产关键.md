Strive for Early Planting, Reasonably Arrange Crop Rotations, and Earnestly Strengthen Management
Satellite Management Area Finds Key to Early Maturity and High Yield of Late Rice

Chengdu, September 1st (By Our Staff Reporter) The Satellite Management Area of Jiuxian Commune in Wusheng County, Sichuan Province, has summarized the rules for increasing production in late autumn, making every effort to plant and harvest early, increase the yield of late autumn crops, and create conditions for early planting of next year's spring crops.

To ensure increased late autumn production, there has long been a contradiction: late autumn crops grow during the period after the harvest of major spring crops and before the planting of minor spring crops. Therefore, ensuring high yields requires a certain growing period; however, if the growing period is too long, it will delay the planting of minor spring crops, affecting their yield; conversely, if the growing period is too short, it will affect the yield of late autumn crops. How to correctly resolve this time-sensitive contradiction has become a key issue in increasing the production of late autumn crops. The Party branch of the management area, through several years of exploration, has initially grasped some experience, namely, on the one hand, the planting of late autumn crops must seize every second, striving for early planting; on the other hand, there must be appropriate coordination in crop combinations to resolve the contradiction between high yields of various late autumn crops and the production of minor spring crops. At the same time, the Party branch also mobilized the masses to conduct in-depth summarization and analysis of past experiences in increasing the production of late autumn crops, and finally found a method of crop combination that does not affect minor spring crops and can ensure high yields of late autumn crops. For example, if the late minor spring crop is the Nandadierjiu wheat, which is planted later, then plant late autumn crops such as autumn sweet potatoes and autumn buckwheat, which have longer growing periods; if the late crop is the Shengli rapeseed and broad beans, which are planted earlier, then plant late autumn crops such as autumn radishes and vegetables, which have shorter growing periods. For varieties that cannot be connected, take measures such as intercropping to resolve them reasonably.

In addition to doing a good job in connecting the preceding and following crops and early planting, the Party branch of the Satellite Management Area also timely grasped field management in accordance with the spirit of planting and managing simultaneously, promoting the rapid development and early maturity of late autumn crops. The methods they adopted were to prescribe the right medicine according to the characteristics of various late autumn crops. For example, the characteristic of autumn sweet potatoes is that they are planted late, making it difficult to ensure a temperature suitable for their growth, which affects high yields. Therefore, they applied top dressing to the planted autumn sweet potatoes to ensure that seedlings are cultivated as early as possible, promoting early root growth and catching up with the season of rapid tuber growth. It was also decided that in the future, in case of missed seasons or temporary low temperatures, measures such as improving drainage, applying more thermal fertilizers, and cultivating and loosening the soil more will be taken to increase soil temperature and create conditions for sweet potato growth. According to the experience of deputy team leader Chen Deyou in managing autumn sweet potatoes last year, grasping the above characteristics and vigorously promoting the early development and early maturity of sweet potatoes, the yield per mu can be more than 50% higher than usual, approaching the yield level of summer sweet potatoes. The characteristic of autumn buckwheat is that it grows with flowers, sprouting a node, flowering, and bearing seeds each time. Generally, there are three times of sprouting nodes, flowering, and bearing seeds, with an interval of about thirty days each time. Therefore, in field management, it is necessary to apply more top dressing to shorten the time of each sprouting node, flowering, and bearing seeds, so that the last flowering can avoid the historical continuous rain and ensure seed setting. In the past, some commune members did this, shortening the time of each sprouting node, flowering, and bearing seeds by twenty days, ensuring that the last flowering bore seeds, and later the yield increased by about 40%. Therefore, the commune members took measures of large fertilizer and large water, and timely and reasonably fertilized and watered the planted buckwheat.

To ensure that the quality of planting and management meets the required standards meticulously, the management area allocated the management responsibility of each late autumn crop to individuals, with each laborer managing one to two mu, before planting, in accordance with the principle, and stipulated that the quality should be accepted by the manager, which played a great role in ensuring quality. At the same time, through the mass fertilizer accumulation movement, a large batch of base fertilizer and top dressing was prepared for late autumn crops, meeting the current needs and promoting the planting and growth of late autumn crops.

### 尽量早播　合理安排茬口　切实加强管理  卫星管理区找到晚稻早熟高产关键

    尽量早播　合理安排茬口　切实加强管理
    卫星管理区找到晚稻早熟高产关键
    本报成都1日电　四川武胜县旧县公社卫星管理区总结晚秋增产的规律，千方百计力争早种早收，提高晚秋作物产量，并为早种明年小春作物创造条件。
    为了保证晚秋增产，长时期以来存在这样一个矛盾：晚秋作物是利用大春收割后至小春播种前这一段时间生长，因此，保证高产必须给予一定的生长时间；但是生长时间过长，就会延迟小春播种，影响小春产量；反之，生长期过短，又会影响晚秋作物产量。如何正确解决这个争时的矛盾，就成为晚秋作物增产的一个关键问题。管理区党支部通过几年的摸索，初步掌握到一些经验，即一方面晚秋播种必须争分夺秒，尽量早播；另一方面，必须在作物组合上恰当配合，以解决晚秋多种高产与小春生产的矛盾。与此同时，党支部并发动群众对往年晚秋作物的增产经验，深入进行总结、分析，终于找出了既不影响小春作物，又能保证晚秋高产的作物组合的办法。比如后期小春作物要是播种时间较迟的南大二四一九小麦，这季晚秋就栽上生长期较长的秋甘薯和秋荞子；后期作物要是播种时间早的胜利油菜和葫豆，这季晚秋就种下生长期短的秋萝卜和蔬菜。对不能衔接的品种，则采取套种等办法进行合理解决。
    除了搞好前后作物的衔接和早播、早栽外，卫星管理区党支部还根据边种边管的精神，及时抓好田间管理，促进晚秋作物快发育、早成熟。他们采取的办法是根据各种晚秋作物的特点，对症下药。如秋甘薯的特点是种得迟，难以保证有适宜它生长的温度，影响高产。因此，他们对已栽的秋甘薯就大施追肥，保证及早把苗子培育起来，促进它早长块根，赶上猛长薯块的季节。并决定今后万一错过季节，或临时遇到低温天气，就通过搞好排水、多施热性肥料、多中耕松土等办法，提高地温，创造长薯条件。根据副队长陈德友去年管理秋甘薯的经验，抓住以上特点，狠狠地促进甘薯早发育、早成熟，每亩产量可比一般高出50％以上，接近伏甘薯产量水平。秋荞子的特点，是带花生长，每拔一个节，开一次花，结一批籽。一般有三次拔节、开花、结籽，每次间隔三十天左右，因此在田间管理中，必须多施追肥，缩短每次拔节、开花、结籽的时间，最后一次开的花，才能躲过历史性的霪雨，保证结上籽粒。过去，部分社员这样做的结果，每次拔节、开花、结籽的时间缩短二十天，保证最后一次开的花结上了籽，后来产量提高40％左右，因此社员就采取大肥、大水的办法，及时合理地给已种荞子施了肥，浇了水。
    为了使播种、管理质量一丝不苟地达到要求标准，这个管理区在播种以前，就按每一个劳力管一至二亩的原则，把每一块晚秋作物的管理责任落实到人，并规定由管理人验收质量，因而对保证质量起了很大作用。同时，还通过群众性的积肥运动，给晚秋作物准备了很大一批底肥和追肥，满足了当前的需要，促进了晚秋作物的播种和生长。（附图片）
