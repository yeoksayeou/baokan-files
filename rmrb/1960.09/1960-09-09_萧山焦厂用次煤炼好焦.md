Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou, September 6th. The Xiaoshan Coke Plant in Zhejiang Province, despite a 25% reduction in prime coking coal and a 27% increase in blended coking coal, has consistently improved the quality of its coke. In June, the coke ash content decreased by 1.7% compared to May. In July, it decreased by 2% compared to June, and in the first half of August, it decreased by another 2.48% compared to July. The sulfur content was reduced to 0.703%, and the coke strength also improved.

Since June, the raw material supply at this plant has changed, with prime coking coal decreasing and blended coking coal increasing, sometimes even using only blended coking coal. To ensure good coke production with blended coking coal, Xiao Shipai, the deputy secretary of the factory's Party committee, and experienced veteran workers and technicians formed an experimental group to conduct small-scale tests using the two most abundant blended coals at the time. These two types of coal were very hard with poor coking performance. Addressing these weaknesses, the experimental group improved the kiln type, adopting double flues, high chimneys, and intense flame heads to fire the kilns. After six or seven trials, they produced high-quality coke. After the success of the experiment, the leadership immediately held an on-site meeting in front of the kiln to introduce and promote it throughout the factory.

In the process of promoting the above experience, the workers created some new experiences. For example, the workers on the No. 4 coking furnace created a set of experiences for burning small stoves. After the promotion of this experience, the furnace temperature of all coke ovens in the factory was maintained above one thousand degrees, achieving the requirement of using inferior coal to produce high-quality coke.

### 萧山焦厂用次煤炼好焦

    萧山焦厂用次煤炼好焦
    新华社杭州6日电　浙江省萧山炼焦厂在主焦煤减少25％，配焦煤增加27％的情况下，所产焦炭质量仍然步步上升。这个厂6月份焦炭灰分比5月份减少1.7％，7月份比6月份减少2％，8月上半月又比7月减少2.48％，硫分降到0.703％，焦炭强度也有提高。
    这个厂从6月份以来，原料供应起了变化，主焦煤减少，配焦煤增多，有时甚至全是配焦煤。为了保证用配焦煤炼出好焦，工厂党委副书记萧世培和有经验的老工人、技术人员共同组成了试验小组，用当时为数最多的两种配煤作小型试验。这两种煤的质地很硬，结焦性能差。针对这些弱点，试验小组改进窑型，采用双火道，高烟囱，猛火头等办法烧窑，经过六、七次试验，炼出了好焦。试验成功以后，领导方面立即在窑前召开现场会，向全厂作了介绍和推广。
    在推广上述经验的过程中，职工们又创造了一些新的经验。例如第四炼焦炉上的职工就创造了一套烧小灶的经验。这一套经验推广以后，全厂所有焦炉的炉温都保持在一千度以上，达到了次煤炼好焦的要求。
