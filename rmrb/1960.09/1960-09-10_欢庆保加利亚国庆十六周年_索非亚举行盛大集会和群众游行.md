Xinhua News Agency, Sofia, September 8th: Sofia's working people from all walks of life held a grand rally in the People's Opera House on the evening of September 8th to celebrate the sixteenth anniversary of Bulgaria's National Day.

Attending the celebration were Bulgarian Communist Party and state leaders Ganev, Yugov, R. Damyanov, I. Mikhailov, Chervenkov, and G. Zankov, among others.

Invited guests included Dolores Ibárruri, General Secretary of the Communist Party of Spain, who is vacationing in Bulgaria, and diplomatic envoys from various countries stationed in Sofia.

The meeting was presided over by Ganev, member of the Political Bureau of the Bulgarian Communist Party Central Committee and Chairman of the Presidium of the National Assembly. At the beginning of the meeting, he suggested that everyone stand and observe a moment of silence in mourning for Wilhelm Pieck, the recently deceased President of the German Democratic Republic.

Subsequently, I. Mikhailov, member of the Political Bureau of the Bulgarian Communist Party Central Committee and Minister of National Defense, delivered a report at the meeting. In his report, Mikhailov first introduced the tremendous achievements Bulgaria has made in socialist construction and improving people's lives in the sixteen years since liberation. He pointed out that in the sixteen years since the establishment of the people's regime, Bulgaria has built an industry that could not be established during the nearly seventy years of capitalist rule. Before the war, Bulgaria was almost at the same level as Greece and Turkey in terms of industrial development. By the end of 1958, Bulgaria's electricity production per capita was about twice that of Greece and five times that of Turkey; steel production was about four times that of Turkey; and coal production was about eleven times that of Greece and eight times that of Turkey.

He said that before liberation, Bulgaria was a raw material appendage of imperialism, and all kinds of machinery and equipment were imported. Today, Bulgaria's machine production can meet a large part of its own needs and also exports electric motors, transformers, electric hoists, train carriages, mineral processing equipment, and metal processing machines.

Speaking of the achievements in agriculture, Mikhailov emphasized that the victory of the cooperative system has transformed Bulgaria into a country with large-scale and mechanized socialist agriculture. The merger of agricultural cooperatives is a new and higher stage in the development of the agricultural cooperative system. The merger of agricultural cooperatives can better unleash enormous potential, more fully utilize agricultural technology and the labor of cooperative members, and more widely apply advanced experiences in science and agricultural production.

Mikhailov pointed out that this year is a decisive year for completing the Third Five-Year Plan (1958-1962) ahead of schedule. According to the plan, this year's total industrial output will increase by 15.2% compared with 1959, reaching the level of the final year of the Third Five-Year Plan – 1962. There will be similar results in terms of total agricultural output. The next few months are decisive for completing this year's plan and the entire Five-Year Plan in industry, construction, and agriculture. The task of each enterprise, construction site, and agricultural cooperative is to strive to complete all indicators of its annual plan ahead of schedule and fulfill the guarantees made to the Bulgarian Communist Party Central Committee.

Xinhua News Agency, Sofia, September 9th: A grand military parade and mass procession were held on "September 9th" Square in Sofia today to celebrate the sixteenth anniversary of Bulgaria's National Day. Officers and soldiers of all arms of the military and working people from all walks of life, full of vigor, marched in the rain.

At 9:00 a.m., Bulgarian Communist Party and government leaders, led by Yugov, stepped onto the reviewing stand amidst warm applause. General Ivan Mikhailov, member of the Political Bureau of the Bulgarian Communist Party Central Committee and Minister of National Defense, reviewed the troops of all arms stationed on and near "September 9th" Square, and then stepped onto the rostrum to deliver a speech, congratulating the people of the country on the holiday.

At 9:30 a.m., the parade began with the cadets of the military academy at the head. The naval and army contingents marched across the square with neat steps. Immediately following them were powerful mechanized units, artillery units, and tank units. The heroic image and spirit of the officers and soldiers of the Bulgarian People's Army participating in the parade won continuous and enthusiastic applause.

At 10:00 a.m., the mass procession began. The front of the procession was several groups of animated floats made of people. After the animated floats, a group of innocent and lively Young Pioneers presented flowers to the Bulgarian Communist Party and government leaders standing on the reviewing stand.

Then, the contingents of working people from the five districts of Sofia marched mightily across the square. They held high banners proclaiming the early completion of the plan, waved flowers, pine branches, and colorful flags, and shouted slogans such as "Hurrah!" and "BCP!" to salute their leaders. The procession lasted about two hours and ended in joyful songs and dances.

That evening, the Presidium of the Bulgarian National Assembly and the Council of Ministers held a grand National Day reception at the "Balkan" Hotel.

Xinhua News Agency, Sofia, September 8th: On the eve of the sixteenth anniversary of Bulgaria's National Day, the Central Committee of the Bulgarian Communist Party issued a congratulatory message, congratulating the people of the country on the holiday.

The congratulatory message, published in newspapers here on the 7th, talked about the tremendous achievements Bulgaria has made in socialist construction. The congratulatory message pointed out that now, the working people of the whole country are actively and smoothly completing the resolutions of the Seventh Congress of the Bulgarian Communist Party and the main economic and political task—accelerating the development of the material and technical base of socialism, and finally building a socialist society in Bulgaria.

The congratulatory message said that Bulgaria's total social product and national income are growing rapidly. Last year, the total social product increased by 19.3% compared with 1958, reaching approximately 93 billion leva (Bulgarian currency). During the same period, national income increased by 21.60%. Materials show that this year's social product and national income will also increase significantly.

Socialist industry is developing at a vigorous pace. Last year, industrial output grew the most, increasing by 25% compared to the previous year. The successful completion of this year's plan will guarantee an increase of about 15% compared with 1959.

As in last year, the achievements in capital construction this year are significant. The total amount of state capital construction investment planned for this year is 7.859 billion leva, equivalent to half of the total amount of capital construction investment during the entire First Five-Year Plan period.

Agriculture is also developing rapidly. The merger of agricultural cooperatives has created conditions for more rapidly consolidating and developing the cooperative system. Agricultural cooperatives have become powerful agricultural enterprises. This enables agricultural cooperatives to better tap and utilize their increased production potential, and more widely apply science and advanced experience in agriculture.

The national agricultural output is expected to increase by 6.2% according to the Third Five-Year Plan instructions, but in 1959 the national agricultural output increased by 18.1% compared with 1958; the output of national agricultural cooperatives increased by 31% compared with 1958. Although the climatic conditions in many areas were not good this year, the merged agricultural cooperatives will achieve the highest output in the history of Bulgarian agriculture.

The accelerated development of Bulgaria's socialist economy has created an increasingly broad and solid foundation for continuously improving the material and cultural conditions of the people.

The congratulatory message said that as a result of carrying out the nationwide movement to complete the Third Five-Year Plan within a shortened period, some enterprises have already completed the tasks of the Five-Year Plan two years ahead of schedule. There is every reason to expect that as long as the working people in industrial enterprises, construction sites, transportation, and agriculture work well, the Five-Year Plan will be completed ahead of schedule. This will be a huge economic and political victory for the Bulgarian people. It will create the possibility in Bulgaria to begin implementing the Fourth Five-Year Plan for the development of the national economy not from 1963, but from 1961.

The congratulatory message then said that all materials show that this year is better than last year in every aspect, and completing the economic plan is a realistic task.

In the first seven months of this year, the industrial plan was completed by 101.5%, and the products produced exceeding the original plan were equivalent to 353 million leva. The state's plan for purchasing agricultural products has also been completed very well. In the first seven months of this year, agricultural cooperatives sold 71.1 million kilograms more milk and 192 million more eggs to the state than in the same period last year. This shows that the Bulgarian working class and agricultural cooperative members are victoriously struggling to realize the program of accelerating the development of the national economy this year.

The congratulatory message then called on the working people of Bulgaria to work harder to strive to complete this year's national economic development plan ahead of schedule.

When talking about international issues, the congratulatory message pointed out that now no force can stop the rapid development of the world socialist system. The foundations of imperialism are shaking greatly and weakening day by day, and the colonial system of Africa, Asia, and Latin America is collapsing. The world democratic and anti-imperialist movement is becoming increasingly broad. The congratulatory message emphasized that on this most glorious National Day, the Bulgarian Communist Party, the government, and the Bulgarian people will once again show their full determination to continue to wage a resolute struggle for lasting world peace and peaceful coexistence between countries with different social systems, against imperialist provocations, and to strive to transform the Balkans into a region without atomic weapons, without rockets, and for the peace and cooperation of the Balkan peoples.

    欢庆保加利亚国庆十六周年
    索非亚举行盛大集会和群众游行
    保共中央发表贺词号召人民努力工作争取提前完成今年经济计划
    新华社索非亚8日电　索非亚市各阶层劳动人民8日晚间在人民歌剧院大厅举行盛大集会，庆祝保加利亚国庆十六周年。
    出席庆祝大会的有保加利亚共产党和国家领导人加涅夫、于哥夫、拉·达米扬诺夫、伊·米哈伊洛夫、契尔文科夫和格·赞科夫等。
    正在保加利亚度假的西班牙共产党总书记伊巴露丽、各国驻索非亚的外交使节等都应邀出席了大会。
    大会由保共中央政治局委员、国民议会主席团主席加涅夫主持。他在大会开始时，建议全体起立，向最近逝世的德意志民主共和国总统皮克致哀。
    接着，保共中央政治局委员、国防部部长伊·米哈伊洛夫在大会上作报告。米哈伊洛夫在报告中首先介绍了保加利亚解放十六年来，在社会主义建设和改善人民生活方面取得的巨大成就。他指出，自从人民政权建立十六年来，保加利亚已经建立了资本主义统治近七十年期间所不能建立的工业。战前，在工业发展方面保加利亚同希腊和土耳其几乎处在同一水平，而到1958年底，按人口平均计算，保加利亚生产的电力，约相当于希腊的两倍，土耳其的五倍；生产的钢约相当于土耳其的四倍；生产的煤约相当于希腊的十一倍，土耳其的八倍。
    他说，解放前，保加利亚是帝国主义的原料附庸，一切种类的机器和设备都是进口的。今天，保加利亚生产的机器已经能够满足本国的很大一部分需要，并且还出口电动机、变压器、电动小型起重机、火车车厢、选矿厂的设备、金属加工机器等。
    在谈到农业方面取得的成就时，米哈伊洛夫强调指出，合作社制度的胜利使保加利亚变成了具有规模巨大的和机械化了的社会主义农业的国家。农业合作社的合并，是农业社制度发展的新的更高阶段。农业社的合并能够更好地发挥巨大的潜力，更加充分地利用农业技术和社员的劳动，更加广泛地应用科学和农业生产方面的先进经验。
    米哈伊洛夫指出，今年是提前完成第三个五年计划（1958—1962年）的具有决定意义的一年。根据计划，今年的工业总产量将比1959年增长15.2％，将达到第三个五年计划最后一年——1962年的水平。农产品总产量方面也会有同样的结果。今后几个月，是完成今年计划和在工业、建筑业和农业方面完成整个五年计划的具有决定意义的几个月，每个企业、建筑工地和农业合作社的任务是争取提前完成自己的年度计划的各项指标，完成向保共中央所提出的各项保证。
    新华社索非亚9日电　今天索非亚的“九九”广场上举行了盛大阅兵和群众游行，欢庆保加利亚国庆十六周年。参加阅兵和游行的各兵种的官兵和各阶层劳动人民精神焕发，在大雨中行进。
    上午九时，在热烈掌声中以于哥夫为首的保加利亚共产党和政府领导人登上了检阅台。保共中央政治局委员、国防部长伊凡·米哈伊洛夫大将，检阅排列在“九九”广场上和广场附近的各兵种部队，接着登上主席台发表讲话，向全国人民祝贺节日。
    九时半，以军事学院学员为前导的阅兵分列式开始。海、陆军队伍迈着整齐的步伐通过广场。紧接着通过广场的是强大的机械化部队、炮兵部队和坦克部队。参加阅兵的保加利亚人民军官兵的英雄形象和气概博得了不断的热烈的掌声。
    十时，开始了群众游行。游行队伍的前面是几组由人组成的活动模型车。活动模型车过后，一群天真活泼的少先队员把鲜花献给站在检阅台上的保加利亚共产党和政府领导人。
    接着，索非亚市五个区的劳动人民队伍浩浩荡荡通过广场。他们高举着提前完成计划的标语牌，挥舞着鲜花、松枝和彩旗，高喊着“乌啦！”、“保共！”等口号，向自己的领导人致意。游行共进行了约两个小时，在欢乐的歌舞声中结束。
    当天晚上，保加利亚国民议会主席团和部长会议在“巴尔干”饭店举行了盛大国庆招待会。
    新华社索非亚8日电　在保加利亚国庆十六周年前夕，保加利亚共产党中央委员会发表了贺词，向全国人民祝贺节日。
    这里报纸在7日刊登的这个贺词谈到了保加利亚社会主义建设中所取得的巨大成就。贺词指出，现在，保加利亚全国劳动人民正在积极和顺利地完成着保共第七次代表大会的决议和主要的经济和政治任务——加速发展社会主义的物质和技术基础，在保加利亚最终建成社会主义社会。
    贺词中说，保加利亚的社会产品总量和国民收入在迅速增长。去年社会产品总量比1958年增长了19.3％，达到约九百三十亿列弗（保币）。在同一时期，国民收入增加了21.60％。材料表明，今年社会产品和国民收入还将大大增加。
    社会主义工业以蓬勃的速度发展着。去年工业产量增长得最多，比前年增长了25％。今年计划的胜利完成，将保证比1959年增长约15％。
    和去年一样，今年基本建设的成就很大。今年计划的国家基本建设投资总额为七十八亿五千九百万列弗，相当于整个第一个五年计划期间基本建设投资总额的一半。
    农业的发展速度也很快。农业合作社的合并为更加迅速巩固和发展合作社制度创造了条件。农业社变成了强大的农业企业。这使得农业社能够更好地发掘和利用自己增长了的生产潜力，更加广泛地在农业中应用科学和先进经验。
    全国农业产量，根据第三个五年计划指示预计增长6.2％，而1959年全国农业产量比1958年却增长了18.1％；全国农业社的产量则比1958年增长了31％。今年虽然许多地区气候条件不好，但是合并了的农业合作社将获得保加利亚农业史上最高的产量。
    保加利亚社会主义经济的加速发展，创造了不断改善人民的物质和文化状况的日益广泛而强固的基础。
    贺词说，由于开展争取在缩短的期限内完成第三个五年计划的全民运动的结果，一些企业已经提前两年完成了五年计划的任务。有一切根据期待，只要工业企业、建筑工地、运输和农业部门中的劳动人民工作得好，五年计划将提前完成。这将是保加利亚人民的巨大的经济和政治胜利。它将在保加利亚创造出这种可能性：不是从1963年，而是从1961年就能够开始执行发展国民经济的第四个五年计划。
    贺词接着说，一切材料表明，今年在每一方面都比去年好，完成经济计划是现实的任务。
    今年头七个月工业计划完成了101.5％，超过原计划而生产的产品相当于三亿五千三百万列弗。国家收购农产品计划也完成得很好。农业合作社在今年头七个月卖给国家的牛奶比去年同期多七千一百万公斤，鸡蛋多一亿九千二百万个。这表明，保加利亚工人阶级和农业合作社社员们今年正在胜利地为实现加速国民经济发展的纲领而进行着斗争。
    贺词随后号召保加利亚全国劳动人民更加努力地工作，以争取提前完成今年的国民经济发展计划。
    贺词在谈到国际问题时指出，现在任何力量都不能阻挡世界社会主义体系的迅速发展。帝国主义的基础在大大地动摇和日益削弱，非洲、亚洲和拉丁美洲的殖民主义体系在土崩瓦解。世界民主和反帝运动越来越广泛。贺词着重说，在自己的最光辉的国庆节这一天，保加利亚共产党、政府和保加利亚人民将再次显示自己的这一充分的决心：继续进行坚决斗争，争取世界持久和平和不同社会制度国家的和平共处，反对帝国主义的挑衅，争取把巴尔干变成无原子、无火箭和巴尔干各国人民和平和合作的地区。
