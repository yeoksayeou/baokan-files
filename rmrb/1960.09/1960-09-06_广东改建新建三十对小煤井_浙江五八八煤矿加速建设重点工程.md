Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, September 5th: Guangdong Province has recently put into production thirty pairs of rebuilt and newly built small coal mines. These small coal mines, using "foreign" production methods, have an annual production capacity of about 50,000 tons per pair. Currently, dozens more of these small coal mines are under construction throughout the province.

Apart from some that are newly built, most of these small coal mines were rebuilt on the basis of original small, indigenous coal kilns. These technically transformed small coal mines have greatly increased their production capacity compared to the past, becoming the backbone of local small-scale coal mines.

Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou, September 5th: The Zhejiang 588 Coal Mine Company is concentrating its main efforts on accelerating the construction of key projects to ensure that a batch of new mines can be put into production as soon as possible to meet the needs of increased steel production.

After the key projects were determined, the company's Party committee immediately transferred its main leadership force to the key mines, and the main members of the Party committee were assigned to take charge of specific key mines; leaders at all levels also delegated authority to strengthen the front line of key construction. At the same time, the company's logistics departments and various mines were mobilized to explore potential in various ways and vigorously support the construction of key projects.

    广东改建新建三十对小煤井
    浙江五八八煤矿加速建设重点工程
    据新华社广州5日电　广东省改建和新建的三十对小型煤井已在最近投入生产。这些采用洋法生产的小煤井，年产能力每对为五万吨左右。目前全省还有几十对这类的小型煤井正在加紧施工。
    这些小煤井除开部分的是新建之外，大部分是在原有小土煤窑的基础上改建的。这些经过技术改造的小煤井，生产能力比过去大大提高，成为地方小型煤矿中的骨干。
    据新华社杭州5日电　浙江省五八八煤矿公司集中主要力量加速重点工程建设进度，以便保证一批新建矿井能及早投入生产适应增产钢铁需要。
    重点确定以后，公司党委立即把主要领导力量转移到重点矿井，党委的主要成员对重点矿井进行分工包干；各级领导干部也层层下放，加强了重点建设的第一线。与此同时，全公司后勤部门和各矿井也动员了起来，多方设法挖掘潜力，大力支援了重点项目的建设。
