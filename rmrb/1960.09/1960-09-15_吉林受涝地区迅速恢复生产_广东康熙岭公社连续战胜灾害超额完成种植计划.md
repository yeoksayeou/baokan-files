Xinhua News Agency, Changchun Telegram: The people's communes and industrial and mining enterprises in the flood-stricken and waterlogged areas of Jilin Province, under the strong leadership of Party committees at all levels, have achieved considerable success in rescuing affected farmland and replanting late autumn crops. The affected industrial and mining enterprises have gradually resumed production, and the lives of the affected people have also been properly arranged. The people of the province are now fighting with high spirits and full confidence to carry out the increase production and practice economy movement centered on grain and steel.
　　From June 8 to August 23, due to the influence of the Inner Mongolia low pressure and typhoons, some areas of Jilin Province experienced several heavy and torrential rains. On August 23, the rainfall in the central area of the rainstorm, such as Wangqing, Dunhua, Antu, Hunjiang, and Fusong, reached 196 millimeters at one time. Due to the heavy rain, the water level of the rivers in these areas rose sharply, and some embankments breached and rivers overflowed, causing some farmland to be flooded. In addition, continuous rainfall caused waterlogging in some places, resulting in certain disasters.
　　Since the beginning of summer, the Jilin Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China has repeatedly deployed flood prevention and drainage work according to weather forecasts, so that Party committees and people's communes at all levels are prepared ideologically and materially. After the disaster occurred, the secretaries of Party committees at all levels went to the front line to lead flood prevention and disaster relief on the one hand, and lead disaster recovery and production on the other. In the counties and communes in the Baicheng area that were hit by the disaster in early August, the commune members, under the leadership of the Baicheng Prefectural Committee of the Communist Party of China and Party organizations at all levels, actively drained water and rescued seedlings, and cultivated and replanted late autumn crops. After some communes in the Siping area were hit by the disaster, the commune members immediately dug ditches to drain water, so that more than 90% of the crops suffering from waterlogging quickly dehydrated and grew normally. In order to prevent the affected crops from growing excessively and promote early maturity, all localities have applied quick-acting fertilizers and plowed and hoeed more after draining the accumulated water from the farmland.
　　The workers of industrial and mining enterprises hit by rainstorms tried their best to overcome water damage and ensure normal production. The workers in the vertical shaft underground coal mining area of ​​the Zhazi Coal Mine in Tonghua area fought day and night, pumping the underground water out of the well and persisting in normal production. The Jiaohe Coal Mine launched a flood prevention and high-yield campaign, organized a flood prevention team, and sent people to guard important areas. Therefore, the entire mine still overproduced 1,014 tons of raw coal. Railway employees across the province fought day and night in the rainstorm, repairing wherever it was damaged, repairing it as it was damaged, and ensuring smooth transportation.
　　The leading organs of Party committees and governments and troops at all levels are very concerned about the lives of the people in the disaster areas. The Jilin Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, the Provincial People's Committee, the Tonghua Prefectural Committee, and other Party and government leadership departments have all formed comfort groups to conduct cordial condolences in the disaster areas and allocate funds to help the communes restore production and arrange the lives of commune members. Therefore, it greatly encouraged the confidence of the disaster-stricken people in fighting the disaster and actively engaged in the later stage of field management.
　　In order to overcome the disaster, the Jilin Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Provincial People's Committee recently issued instructions on "carrying out production and disaster relief work," requiring leaders in disaster-stricken areas to take responsibility, the entire Party to take action, mobilize the vast number of cadres and the masses, redouble their efforts, overcome all difficulties, and actively do a good job in production and disaster relief. Non-disaster areas should do everything possible to do a good job in field management of autumn crops, try every means to strive to overfulfill the production increase plan, use abundance to compensate for deficiencies, and support disaster areas. At present, a mass movement of production and disaster relief has been further launched in the disaster-stricken areas.
　　Guangzhou, September 14th, this newspaper: Kangxi Ling Commune in Qin County, Guangdong, has continuously overcome drought, flood, and tide disasters, and has exceeded the planting plan for middle and late rice according to the seasons.
　　Kangxi Ling Commune is located in the south of Qin County, surrounded by rivers on the east and west sides, facing the sea on the south, and backed by mountains on the north, and is a plain across the board. 70% of the more than 30,000 mu of arable land in the commune's paddy fields and slopes are often subjected to drought, flood, and tide disasters. It is a commune in Qin County with frequent disasters. Since the beginning of this year, after four consecutive months of severe drought, it suffered an unprecedented flood and tide disaster in mid-July, with most crops submerged and the transplanted mid- and late-season rice suffering damage to varying degrees. After this flood, the entire commune concentrated its labor force to rush to transplant and sow, and finally transplanted 26,000 mu of mid- and late-season rice three days after the "Beginning of Autumn," overfulfilling the task assigned by the county party committee. Through this disaster relief struggle, the commune party committee and the people of the entire commune further realized the important role of prevention first and several arrangements in the struggle against nature.
　　The commune party committee analyzed the situation of the commune's cultivated land. The commune has a total of 14,000 mu of alkaline land and 4,000 mu of disaster-affected land (mostly mountain pit fields). The two types of land account for 70% of the total paddy field area, all of which are low-yield fields with great potential for increasing production. This is a major concern related to the bumper harvest of late crops. Therefore, the commune party committee decided to carry out "alkaline land catching up with light land, disaster-affected land catching up with high yield" as the first line of defense. In field management, for the 4,000 mu of two-crop fields in alkaline land that are prone to drought and re-acidification and have never been fertilized, cow urine manure and scallop shell ash are applied in an unprecedented manner, and twelve long water ditches are dug to divert fresh water from the Qin River to float the fields to prevent drought and re-acidification. For the 4,000 mu of disaster-affected land, according to the fact that it was originally cold and lacked organic fertilizer after the disaster, 200 catties of scallop shell ash and 40 loads of high-quality household manure are applied per mu to increase fertility and soil temperature. In order to change the situation that no one manages these fields, the commune has also organized nearly 100 professional groups to be responsible to the end. Now, the first fertilization and weeding of 4,000 mu of disaster-affected fields has ended, and the fertilization of alkaline fields has also begun. The growth momentum of rice seedlings is generally very good.
　　The commune party committee also took effective measures to highlight the management of 7,500 mu of good land with sufficient water and no worries about waterlogging (that is, basic farmland), and strive to achieve a harvest of one mu equal to two mu, as the second line of defense. These fields are given "four preferential treatments" (preferential treatment for personnel, preferential treatment for fertilizers, preferential treatment for pesticides, and preferential treatment for drainage and irrigation), requiring four to five applications of fertilizer.
　　Now the high-yield fields have been generally fertilized once, and 60% of the paddy fields have completed the second fertilization and generally sprayed pesticides twice to prevent and control pests.
　　In order to ensure a bumper harvest of grain this year in all aspects, on the basis of overfulfilling the planting plan for middle and late rice, the commune party committee continued to expand the planting of rice and miscellaneous grains, striving to plant more and harvest more, as the third line of defense. By fully utilizing "five edges" land and wasteland reclamation, intercropping and sweet potatoes going to the mountains, the original planting plan of 4,000 mu of autumn-planted sweet potatoes was expanded to 6,000 mu.

    吉林受涝地区迅速恢复生产
    广东康熙岭公社连续战胜灾害超额完成种植计划
    据新华社长春电　吉林省遭受洪水袭击和内涝为害地区的人民公社和工矿企业，在各级党委的坚强领导下，抢救受灾农田和抢种晚秋作物的工作，已经获得不小成绩，受灾的工矿企业已陆续恢复生产；对受灾群众的生活也都进行了妥善的安排。全省人民正在斗志昂扬、信心百倍地开展以粮、钢为中心的增产节约运动。
    从6月8日到8月23日，因受内蒙古低气压和台风的影响，吉林部分地区先后连降了几次大雨和暴雨。8月23日暴雨中心地区汪清、敦化、安图、浑江、抚松等县市一次降雨都达一百九十六毫米。由于雨大，这些地区的江河水位猛涨，部分堤坝决口和河水出槽，使部分农田被淹，再加连续降雨，有些地方形成内涝，造成了一定灾害。
    入夏以来中共吉林省委即根据气象预报多次部署防汛抗涝工作，使各级党委和人民公社从思想上物质上作好准备。灾情发生后，各级党委的书记都亲临第一线，一面领导抗洪防汛，一面领导抗灾恢复生产。白城地区8月初受灾的县、社，社员们在中共白城地委和各级党组织的领导下，积极排涝救苗，并垦种和复种晚秋作物。四平地区一些公社受灾后，社员们立即挖沟排水，使遭受内涝的庄稼90％多很快脱水，正常生长。为了防止受灾庄稼贪青，促进作物早熟，各地都在排出农田积水以后，给农作物追施速效肥料和多铲多趟。
    受暴雨袭击的工矿企业职工们，千方百计地战胜水害，保证正常生产。通化地区砟子煤矿竖井井下采煤区的职工，昼夜奋战，把井下水抽到井外，坚持了正常生产。蛟河煤矿开展了防汛高产运动，组织防汛队伍，派人防守险要地带，因而，全矿仍超产原煤一千零一十四吨。全省铁路员工在暴雨中昼夜奋战，作到那里坏了那里修，随坏随修，保证了运输畅通。
    各级党委和政府、部队的领导机关对灾区人民群众的生活非常关心。中共吉林省委、省人民委员会和通化地委等各级党和政府领导部门都组成了慰问团，深入灾区进行亲切慰问，并拔出款项帮助公社恢复生产和安排社员生活。因而，大大鼓舞了受灾群众的抗灾信心，积极投入后期田间管理运动。
    为了战胜灾害，中共吉林省委和省人民委员会最近又发出了“关于开展生产救灾工作”的指示，要求受灾地区领导负责，全党动手，动员广大干部和群众，鼓足更大干劲，克服一切困难，积极做好生产救灾工作；非灾区要千方百计地搞好秋收作物的田间管理，想尽一切办法努力超额完成增产计划，以丰补歉，支援灾区。目前，受灾地区已经进一步掀起了生产救灾的群众运动。
    本报广州14日电　广东钦县康熙岭公社连续战胜旱灾、洪灾、潮灾，按季节超额完成中、晚稻种植计划。
    康熙岭公社位于钦县南部，东西两边环江，南面临海，北面靠山，纵横是一幅平原。全社三万多亩耕地有70％的稻田和坡地经常受到旱灾、洪灾、潮灾的侵袭，是钦县灾害较频繁的一个公社。今年以来，在连续四个月的大旱后，7月中旬又受到百年未有的洪灾和潮灾，大部分作物受淹，已插的中、晚稻受到不同程度的损失。这次水灾后，全社集中劳力抢插抢种，终于在“立秋”后三天插下二万六千亩中、晚稻，超额完成了县委分配的任务。经过这次抗灾斗争，公社党委和全社人民进一步认识到在同大自然作斗争中，防字当先，几套安排的重大作用。
    公社党委分析了全社耕地的情况，全社共有碱田一万四千亩，受灾田（多是山坑田）四千亩，两种田共占稻田总面积70％，都是低产田，增产潜力很大，这是关系到晚造丰歉的大关。因此，公社党委决定开展“碱田赶淡田，灾田赶丰产”作为第一道防线。在田间管理中，对碱田中的四千亩易旱易反酸的向来不施肥的二架田，破例大施牛尿粪肥和蚌壳灰，开挖十二道长水沟，引钦江淡水漂田，防旱防反酸。对四千亩受灾田，根据原来是冷底、受灾后更缺乏有机肥的情况，每亩施蚌壳灰二百斤、优质家肥四十担；增加肥力，增加土温。为了改变这些田没人管理的情况，公社又组织了近百个专业组，负责管到底。现在，四千亩受灾田第一次施肥耘田已经结束，碱田的施肥也开始。禾苗生势普遍很好。
    公社党委还采取有效措施，突出管好七千五百亩饱水和不愁水浸的良田（即基本农田），力争一亩顶两亩收成，作为第二道防线。这些田实行“四优待”（人员优待、肥料优待、农药优待、排灌优待），要求施肥四至五次。
    现在高产田已经普遍施肥一次，有六成稻田已完成第二次施肥、普遍喷射二次农药防治虫害。
    为了从各方面保证今年粮食丰收，公社党委在超额完成中、晚稻种植计划的基础上，继续扩种水稻、杂粮，力争多种多收，以此作为第三道防线。由于充分利用“五边”地和开荒、间种和红薯上山等办法，把原来四千亩的秋植红薯种植计划扩大到六千亩。
