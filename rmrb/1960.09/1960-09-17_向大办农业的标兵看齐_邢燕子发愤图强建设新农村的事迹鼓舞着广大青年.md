    Learning from the Agricultural Pace-Setters
    Xing Yanzi's Deeds of Aspiring to Build a New Socialist Countryside Inspire the Broad Masses of Young People
    She, Like Xing Yanzi,
    Fell in Love with Agricultural Labor
    Huang Ai'yun, a seventeen-year-old female member of the Communist Youth League from Libo Commune, Dushan County, Guizhou Province, has a father who is a construction worker, a mother who is a textile worker, and an older sister who is a seamstress. However, she, like Xing Yanzi, fell in love with agricultural labor.
    Last spring, Huang Ai'yun resolved to stay in the countryside long-term and participate in agricultural production. At the time, some in her family disagreed, arguing that the whole family worked in industry, so why did she have to farm. Ai'yun replied, "Workers and peasants are one family. You work in industry, and I farm. Producing more grain and industrial raw materials is also supporting you!"
    After participating in agricultural production, Ai'yun quickly mastered agricultural techniques because of her determination and ambition. At that time, some young people in her production team were not content with agricultural production, so Ai'yun persuaded them, "We must use our arduous labor to change the face of the countryside. In the future, when agricultural mechanization is realized, plowing, transplanting, and harvesting will all be done by machines. Then agricultural labor will be even easier and more enjoyable. However, the speed of realizing mechanization depends on how well we work now. If everyone is not content with participating in agricultural production, then there is no point in talking about realizing mechanization in the future." Under Ai'yun's persuasion and influence, more than a dozen young people who had originally wanted to go out to find work also resolved to devote themselves to agriculture for life.
    Because Ai'yun was active in production and worked conscientiously, she was elected by the commune members as the production team leader. She knew that her responsibility was even greater. In order to vigorously develop agriculture and grain production, Ai'yun actively responded to the call of the commune's Party committee and tried every means to expand the cultivated area. She led more than 20 commune members to plant corn on a distant mountain, living and eating on the mountain for more than ten days, and successfully completed the planting task. Therefore, their production team was rated as a red banner team in the entire management district.

    Learning from Xing Yanzi, Determined to Stay in the Countryside
    After reading the model deeds of "Xing Yanzi Aspiring to Build a New Socialist Countryside," I am determined to strive to be the Xing Yanzi of our hometown.
    After graduating from elementary school this year, I did not pass the entrance exam to middle school, so I wrote letters to relatives and friends, asking them to find me a job, and I was not content to participate in agricultural labor in the countryside. Just at this time, the newspaper published Xing Yanzi's model deeds of building the countryside, and I read it repeatedly several times. This is truly a good medicine for curing my illness of not wanting to participate in agricultural labor. Xing Yanzi, whose entire family works in the city, resolutely listened to the Party's words, stayed in the countryside, and worked hard to change the face of poverty. This is a good example for every young person in the countryside. We were born in the countryside and grew up in the countryside, so we should be down-to-earth and engage in agricultural production without fear of any difficulties or hardships. The Party needs thousands upon thousands of young people like Xing Yanzi with great ambitions. I am determined to correct my past wrong ideas and always be a glorious agricultural worker. Therefore, the next day, I went to the production team leader, explained that I was determined to participate in agricultural labor, and devote my strength to vigorously developing agriculture and grain production.

    向大办农业的标兵看齐
    邢燕子发愤图强建设新农村的事迹鼓舞着广大青年
    她像邢燕子一样
    爱上了农业劳动
    贵州独山县荔波公社十七岁的女共青团员黄爱云，父亲是建筑工人，母亲是纺织工人，姐姐是缝纫工人，可是她就像邢燕子那样，爱上了农业劳动。
    去年春天，黄爱云下决心要长期留在农村，参加农业生产。当时，家里有的人不同意，理由是一家子都做工，偏偏你要务农。爱云回答说：“工农是一家，你们做工我种田，多生产粮食和工业原料，也是对你们的支援呀！”
    爱云参加农业生产以后，因为有决心，有志气，很快地掌握了农业技术。当时，她们生产队里有的青年不安心农业生产，爱云就劝他们：“我们要用自己艰苦的劳动，改变农村的面貌。将来实现了农业机械化，打田、插秧、收割样样都用机器，那时农业劳动就更轻松愉快了。可是实现机械化的快慢，要看我们现在劳动的好坏，如果大家都不安心参加农业生产，就谈不到将来实现机械化了。”在爱云的劝说和影响下，原来想外出找工作的十几名青年，也下定决心立志终身搞农业。
    由于爱云生产积极、干活认真，被社员选为生产小队长，她知道自己的责任更重大了。为了大办农业、大办粮食，爱云积极响应公社党委的号召，千方百计扩大耕地面积，她带领二十多名社员到远山上抢种包谷，在山上食宿十多天，出色地完成了播种任务。因此，她们的生产小队被评为全管理区的红旗小队。

    学习邢燕子决心留在农村
    读了“邢燕子发愤图强建设新农村”的模范事迹以后，我决心争取做我们家乡的邢燕子。
    我今年小学毕业后没有考上中学，就给亲戚朋友写信，托他们找工作，不安心在农村参加农业劳动。正在这个时候，报上登出了邢燕子建设农村的模范事迹，我反复地读了好几遍。这对医治我不愿参加农业劳动的病，真是一服良药。邢燕子，全家人都在城市工作，她坚决听党的话，留在农村，埋头苦干，改变贫穷的面貌，这是我们每个农村青年的好榜样。我们生在农村，长在农村，就应该踏踏实实，不怕一切艰难困苦从事农业生产。党需要千千万万像邢燕子这样有雄心大志的青年，我决心纠正自己过去的错误想法，永远做一个光荣的农业劳动者。因此，第二天，我就找到生产队长，说明要下决心参加农业劳动，为大办农业、大办粮食献出力量。
