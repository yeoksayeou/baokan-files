Xinhua News Agency, September 12th:

    During a meeting with visiting Japanese friends, Premier Zhou talked about the Three Principles of Sino-Japanese Trade:
    The three principles are: Government Agreement; Private Contracts; Individual Considerations.
    Warmly praised the Japanese people's patriotic and just struggle against the United States, believing that the Japanese people have a great future and that the day is not far off when an independent, democratic, peaceful, and neutral Japan will appear on the international stage.

    Xinhua News Agency, September 12th: Premier Zhou Enlai met with Hozumi Shichiro, Chairman of the Special Committee for the Protection of the Constitution of the Japan Socialist Party, Yoshida Noriharu, Standing Director and Councilor of the Japan-China Friendship Association, and Hasegawa Toshizo, Secretary-General of the Secretariat, on the morning of the 10th.
    During the meeting, Premier Zhou had a long conversation with the three Japanese friends, Hozumi Shichiro, Yoshida Noriharu, and Hasegawa Toshizo, in a friendly atmosphere. Premier Zhou warmly praised the great victories achieved by the Japanese people in their patriotic and just struggle against the United States for more than a year. Premier Zhou said that the Japanese people have a great future and great hope, and the day is not far off when an independent, democratic, peaceful, and neutral Japan will appear on the international stage. The Chinese people will always stand on the side of the peace-loving Japanese people who uphold national independence.
    Hozumi Shichiro thanked the Chinese people for their support of the Japanese people's struggle and thanked Premier Zhou Enlai for his high evaluation of the Japanese people's anti-American struggle. He said, "We know that a journey of a hundred miles cannot be completed in one step, but as long as the Japanese people unite, they can achieve the final victory of the struggle."
    Yoshida Noriharu said that the Chinese people have given great support to the Japanese people's struggle against the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty," for which he expressed his heartfelt gratitude. He also said that through the joint struggle against U.S. imperialism, the friendship between the Chinese and Japanese people is deepening, and he hopes to further strengthen the friendly exchanges between the two peoples in the future.
    Premier Zhou also spoke to the two Japanese friends, Hozumi Shichiro and Yoshida Noriharu, about the issue of Sino-Japanese trade and pointed out that he had also discussed the issue of Sino-Japanese trade when he spoke with Kazuo Suzuki on August 27th.
    Present at the meeting were Liao Chengzhi, Lei Renmin, Zhou Erfu, Lin Lin, Wu Xiaoda, and Yang Zheng. Kinkazu Saionji, a Japanese peace activist in Beijing, was also present.

    Xinhua News Agency, September 12th: Premier Zhou Enlai, during a meeting with Hozumi Shichiro, Chairman of the Special Committee for the Protection of the Constitution of the Japan Socialist Party, Yoshida Noriharu, Standing Director and Councilor of the Japan-China Friendship Association, and Hasegawa Toshizo, Secretary-General of the Secretariat, on the morning of September 10th, gave Hozumi Shichiro, Yoshida Noriharu, and Hasegawa Toshizo a record of his conversation with Kazuo Suzuki, Executive Director of the Japan-China Trade Promotion Association, on August 27th regarding Sino-Japanese relations and Sino-Japanese trade issues. The full text of this record is as follows:

    Premier Zhou said: You have said a lot, and now I will tell you a little about China's trade policy toward Japan. The Japanese like to use the term "three principles," so now I will also say three principles, which are the three principles of Sino-Japanese trade, and these three principles have emerged from the struggle against the anti-China policy of Nobusuke Kishi. In the past, China and Japan engaged in private group agreements, hoping to develop Sino-Japanese trade through private agreements. After this period of the Kishi Nobusuke government, it proved that this approach did not work. Kishi Nobusuke did not recognize or guarantee the implementation of private agreements, and took an anti-China policy to undermine them. We cannot tolerate this action, so we had to stop Sino-Japanese trade for two and a half years. According to the wishes of the people of China and Japan, if Sino-Japanese trade can gradually recover, it will be beneficial to the people of both countries. However, we still need to see what the attitude of the Ikeda government is. We now put forward three principles, which are: 1. Government agreement; 2. Private contract; 3. Individual care.

    First of all, all agreements must now be concluded by the governments of both sides to be guaranteed, because in the past, the Japanese government was unwilling to guarantee private agreements. As for government agreements, they can only be signed when the governments of the two countries are developing in a friendly direction and have established normal relations; otherwise, they cannot be signed. Regarding the relations between the two governments, Comrade Liu Ningyi has already made it very clear in Tokyo, and we still adhere to the political three principles we have said in the past. The three principles of the past were not demanding anything of the Japanese government, but were very fair. That is to say: First, the Japanese government must not be hostile to China, because the Chinese government is not hostile to Japan, and recognizes Japan's existence, and is happy to see the development of the Japanese people; if the two sides negotiate, of course, the Japanese government will be the counterpart. However, the Japanese government does not do this to China; they do not recognize the existence of New China, but on the contrary, they are hostile to New China, recognizing Taiwan and saying that it represents China. They also do not take the New China government as their negotiating counterpart. Second, they must not follow the United States in engaging in the "two Chinas" conspiracy. Whether the Democratic or Republican Party is elected president of the United States in the future, they will all engage in the "two Chinas" conspiracy. The Taiwan system newspapers in Hong Kong say that the Republican Party is passively and expectantly engaging in "two Chinas"; if the Democratic Party comes to power, it will be actively and proactively engaging in "two Chinas." I think this statement makes some sense. If the United States does this and Japan follows, we will of course oppose it.

    Third, do not hinder the development of Sino-Japanese relations towards normalization. Our three principles are very fair, and you will understand if you ask yourself in reverse. First, the Chinese government is not hostile to Japan and is willing to be friendly with Japan; second, the Chinese government only recognizes one Japan and does not engage in two Japans, and will always take the Japanese government as its negotiating counterpart; third, it always encourages, supports, and helps Sino-Japanese relations to develop in a normal direction. Why shouldn't the Japanese government do this? Some recent speeches by the new Japanese government, whether it be Prime Minister Ikeda or Foreign Minister Kosaka, have not been good, and we still need to see. In 1957, when I was the Minister of Foreign Affairs, and in 1958, when Deputy Prime Minister Chen Yi was the Minister of Foreign Affairs, we twice condemned the anti-China policy of the Kishi Nobusuke government, and both times it was based on many anti-China activities of Kishi Nobusuke. So now we also need to see the Ikeda government. Based on the above, we conclude that any agreement between the two countries must be made through the government, and private agreements are not guaranteed. This includes trade, fisheries, postal services, shipping, etc.

    Secondly, does that mean that there can be no trade between the two countries without an agreement? No. Trade can be done when conditions are ripe, and private contracts can also be made. For example, if a Japanese company and a Chinese company express friendship and want to negotiate and sign a contract based on the needs of both parties, they can do a one-off deal. If the contract is performed well, the relationship between the two sides is also good, and the political environment in the two countries is developing in a good direction, the short-term contract can also be turned into a longer-term contract. This is thinking in terms of the future.

    Again, there is individual care, which has been going on for two years. Small and medium-sized enterprises have special difficulties, and the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan (Sohyo) and the All-China Federation of Trade Unions are mediating in the interests of the working people, which is correct. This can continue in the future, and the quantity can also be expanded as needed. Comrade Liu Ningyi has already answered this in Tokyo.

    Your Japan-China Trade Promotion Association can introduce what you consider to be friendly and potentially mutually beneficial business according to the above three principles of Sino-Japanese trade. You can contact our China Council for the Promotion of International Trade, they understand this principle. The All-China Federation of Trade Unions also knows about individual care, and you can talk to the All-China Federation of Trade Unions. After Mr. Suzuki returns, he can also talk to friends from relevant companies in the Japan-China Trade Promotion Association.

    I would also like to add that we continue to oppose the new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" because it is hostile to China and the Soviet Union, threatens Southeast Asia, and is detrimental to peace in the Far East and Asia. We support the Japanese people's struggle against the new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" and the struggle for the establishment of an independent, peaceful, democratic, and neutral Japan. Please convey the Chinese people's respect and support to the Japanese people, Mr. Suzuki. (Photo attached)

    在接见来我国访问的日本朋友的时候
    周总理谈中日贸易三原则
    三原则是：政府协定；民间合同；个别照顾
    热情赞扬日本人民反美爱国正义斗争，认为日本人民大有前途，一个独立、民主、和平、中立的日本出现在国际舞台的日子不远了。
    新华社12日讯　周恩来总理10日上午接见了日本社会党拥护宪法特别委员会委员长穗积七郎、日中友协常任理事参议院议员吉田法晴和事务局局长长谷川敏三。
    在接见的时候，周总理同穗积七郎、吉田法晴和长谷川敏三三位日本朋友，在友好的气氛中，进行了长时间的谈话。周总理热情地赞扬日本人民在一年多以来反美爱国正义斗争中所取得的伟大胜利。周总理说，日本人民大有前途，大有希望，一个独立、民主、和平、中立的日本出现在国际舞台的日子不远了，中国人民将永远站在爱好和平、维护民族独立的日本人民这一边。
    穗积七郎感谢中国人民对日本人民斗争的支持，感谢周恩来总理给予日本人民反美斗争的很高评价。他说，我们知道一百里的路程是不能一步走到的，但是日本人民只要团结起来，就可以取得斗争的最后胜利。
    吉田法晴说，中国人民对日本人民反对日美“安全条约”的斗争给予了很大的支持，对此，他表示衷心感谢。他还说，通过反对美帝国主义的共同斗争，中日两国人民的友谊正在更加深厚，希望今后进一步加强中日两国人民的友好往来。
    周总理还同穗积七郎和吉田法晴两位日本朋友谈到中日两国贸易的问题，并指出，在8月27日同铃木一雄谈话时，也谈到过中日两国的贸易问题。
    接见时，在座的有廖承志、雷任民、周而复、林林、吴晓达和杨正等。在北京的日本和平人士西园寺公一也在座。
    新华社12日讯　周恩来总理于9月10日上午在同日本社会党拥护宪法特别委员会委员长穗积七郎、日中友协常任理事参议院议员吉田法晴和事务局局长长谷川敏三会谈当中，曾将他在8月27日接见日中贸易促进会专务理事铃木一雄时关于中日关系和中日贸易问题的谈话记录交给穗积七郎、吉田法晴和长谷川敏三。这份记录的全文如下：
    周总理说：你说了很多，现在我也告诉你一点中国对日本的贸易政策。日本人喜欢用三原则的说法，现在我也说一个三原则，这就是中日贸易的三原则，而这个三原则是从同岸信介敌视中国政策进行斗争的发展中产生出来的。过去中日双方曾经搞民间团体协定，想通过民间协定来发展中日贸易。经过岸信介政府这一段时期，证明这种作法行不通。岸信介不承认、不保证民间协定的实施，并且采取敌视中国的政策来破坏它。我们不能容忍这种行动，只好将中日贸易来往停了两年半。根据中日两国人民的愿望，中日贸易如果能够逐渐恢复起来，对两国人民都有好处。但是，池田政府的态度究竟如何，我们还要看一看。我们现在提出三原则，就是：一、政府协定；二、民间合同；三、个别照顾。
    首先，一切协定今后必须由双方政府缔结，才有保证，因为过去的民间协定，日本政府不愿给以保证。至于政府协定，总要在两国政府向着友好方向发展，并且建立起正常关系的情况下才能签订，否则不可能签订。关于两国政府的关系，刘宁一同志在东京的时候已经说得很清楚，还是坚持过去我们说过的政治三原则。过去的三原则并不是对日本政府有所苛求，而是很公平的。这就是说：第一，日本政府不能敌视中国，因为中国政府并不敌视日本，并且承认日本的存在，高兴地看到日本人民的发展；如果双方进行谈判，当然以日本政府为对手方。但是，日本政府对中国并不如此，他们不承认新中国的存在，而且相反地敌视新中国，承认台湾，说它代表中国。他们也不以新中国政府为谈判的对手方。第二，不能追随美国，搞“两个中国”的阴谋。美国今后不管是民主党还是共和党当选总统，都是要搞“两个中国”的阴谋的。台湾系统在香港的报纸说，共和党搞“两个中国”是消极的，等待的；如民主党上台后搞“两个中国”会是积极的，主动的。我看这种说法有一定道理。美国这样做，日本追随，我们当然反对。
    第三，不要阻碍中日两国关系向正常化方向发展。我们这三原则是很公道的，反过来问一问就懂了。第一，中国政府并不敌视日本，愿意同日本友好；第二，中国政府只承认一个日本，并不搞两个日本，而且要谈判总会以日本政府为对手方；第三，总是鼓励、支持和帮助中日关系向正常方向发展。为什么日本政府不该这样作呢？新的日本政府，不管池田首相，小坂外相，最近有些讲话是不好的，我们还要看一看。1957年我当外长，1958年陈毅副总理当外长，两次谴责岸信介政府的对华政策，都是根据很多岸信介敌视中国的活动才发表的。所以现在对池田政府也要看一看。基于上述情况，我们得出结论：两国任何协定都要通过政府来订，民间协定没有保证，这就包括贸易、渔业、邮政、航运等等。
    其次，是不是没有协定两国之间就不能作买卖呢？不然。在条件成熟时是可以作买卖的，也可以订立民间合同。比如日本某企业同中国某公司双方表示友好，要根据双方需要，可以谈判签订合同，做一笔定期的生意。如果合同履行得好，双方关系也好，两国政治环境又向好的方向发展，也可以把短期合同变成比较长期的合同。这是从前途方面着想的。
    再次是个别照顾，已经作了两年了。中小企业有特别困难，日本总评和中华全国总工会站在劳动人民的利益上进行斡旋，这是对的。今后还可以继续照顾，并且根据需要，数量也可以扩大一些。这一点刘宁一同志在东京已经答复过了。
    你们日中贸易促进会可以根据上述中日贸易三原则，对你们认为友好的、有可能作的对双方都有利的生意，可以进行介绍。可以同我国的国际贸易促进委员会接洽，他们懂得这个原则。个别照顾，中华全国总工会也知道，可以找总工会谈。铃木先生回去以后，也可以和日中贸易促进会的有关公司的朋友们谈谈。
    我还要补充一句，我们继续反对新日美“安全条约”，因为它以中苏为敌，威胁东南亚，对远东和亚洲的和平不利。我们支持日本人民反对新日美“安全条约”的斗争和为建立独立、和平、民主、中立的日本而进行的斗争。请铃木先生转达中国人民对日本人民的敬意和支持。（附图片）
