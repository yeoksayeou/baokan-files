    In Cuba, a free land in the Americas, beside the image of José Martí and with remembrance of him, the people effectively exercise their sovereignty embodied in a direct and universal referendum, and exercise their resulting inalienable power, now forming the National Assembly.
    The Cuban People's National Assembly, representing itself and concentrating the sentiments of the peoples of our American countries, declares, first, its condemnation of all aspects of the so-called Declaration of San José, Costa Rica, a document imposed by U.S. imperialism that violates the national self-determination, sovereignty, and dignity of the fraternal peoples of the continent.
    Second: The Cuban People's National Assembly strongly condemns the blatant and criminal interference of U.S. imperialism in the affairs of the peoples of Latin America for more than a century; the peoples of various countries have seen more than once, from the examples of Mexico, Nicaragua, Haiti, the Dominican Republic, and Cuba, their lands being violated, losing large tracts of fertile land like Texas under the insatiable plunder of U.S. imperialism, important strategic centers like the Panama Canal, and some countries, such as Puerto Rico, entirely subjugated, becoming occupied territories. Furthermore, they have suffered the insults of marines against our wives and daughters and against the highest symbols of the homeland's history, such as the image of José Martí.
    This intervention, relying on military superiority, unequal treaties, and the subservience of traitorous rulers, has for more than a century reduced our America—the America that Bolívar, Hidalgo, Juárez, San Martín, Voithings, Sucre, and Martí hoped to liberate—to an exploited region, to the backyard of the U.S. political and financial empire, to a voting machine in international institutions, in which we Latin American countries have become slaves of "the arrogant and brutal northern nation we despise."
    The Cuban People's National Assembly declares that the acceptance by governments formally representing Latin American countries of this continuous and historically irrefutable intervention is a betrayal of the ideals of independence of their own peoples, an obliteration of their sovereignty, and an impediment to the true unity of our countries; therefore, this Assembly must, in the name of the Cuban people, issue a voice that embodies the hopes and determination of the peoples of Latin America, condemning it in the tone of liberation sought by our America's immortal greats.
    The Cuban People's National Assembly also condemns the attempt to maintain the Monroe Doctrine, which, as Martí foresaw, has been used to this day to expand the rule of greedy imperialists in the Americas, to better inject the poisons that José Martí also timely condemned—the poisons of loans, canals, and railways.
    Therefore, to counter false Pan-Americanism (which merely represents the control of U.S. monopoly capital over the interests of our peoples, the manipulation of governments lagging behind Washington by the United States), the Cuban People's National Assembly proclaims the liberating Latin Americanism advocated by José Martí and Benito Juárez. The Assembly expresses its friendship with the American people, with the people of a country where black people are lynched, intellectuals are persecuted, workers are forced to be commanded by bandits, and reaffirms its will to advance with the whole world, not with a part of the world.
    The Cuban People's National Assembly declares that the Soviet Union's voluntary suggestion to provide assistance to our country in the event of an attack by imperialist armed forces should never be regarded as an act of interference, but as a clear act of support. This assistance to Cuba in the face of an impending attack by the U.S. Pentagon, on the one hand, glorifies the Soviet government providing the assistance, and on the other hand, shames the U.S. government's cowardly and criminal act of aggression against Cuba.
    Therefore: The Cuban People's National Assembly announces to the Americas and the world that it accepts and expresses gratitude for the rocket support that the Soviet Union will provide in the event that Cuban territory is attacked by U.S. armed forces.
    The Cuban People's National Assembly resolutely denies that the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China have ever had the slightest intention of using Cuba's economic, political, and social position to undermine continental unity and threaten the unity of this hemisphere.
    The Cuban people, from the first shot to the last, from the first of the 20,000 martyrs who sacrificed themselves in the struggle to overthrow the tyrannical rule and gain revolutionary power to the last, from the promulgation of the first revolutionary law to the most recent one, from the first revolutionary action to the most recent one, have acted according to their completely free decisions, and therefore the existence of a revolution can never be attributed to the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China. This revolution is Cuba's best response to the evils and irrationalities caused by imperialism in the Americas.
    On the contrary, the Cuban People's National Assembly believes that the policy of isolating and antagonizing the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China, which the U.S. government promotes and imposes on the governments of Latin American countries, the U.S. government's belligerent, aggressive acts, and its consistent refusal to allow the People's Republic of China to enter the United Nations, regardless of the fact that the People's Republic of China represents almost the entire country with a population of over 600 million, do threaten the peace and security of this hemisphere and the world.
    Therefore, the Cuban People's National Assembly approves its policy of friendship with the peoples of the world, reaffirms its willingness to establish diplomatic relations with all socialist countries, and from now on, exercising its sovereignty and free will, expresses its willingness to establish diplomatic relations between the two countries with the People's Republic of China. Therefore, it is necessary to sever the relations that Cuba still maintains with the puppet regime in Formosa supported by the U.S. Seventh Fleet.
    The Cuban People's National Assembly reiterates that democracy is incompatible with financial oligarchies, with discrimination against black people, with the rampant lawlessness of the Ku Klux Klan, with the dismissal of scientists such as Oppenheimer, with the house arrest of Paul Robeson for many years, preventing the world from hearing his beautiful voice, and with persecution acts such as the brazen execution of the Rosenbergs, regardless of the world's shock and protest, and regardless of the appeals of rulers and even Pope Pius XII.
    The Cuban People's National Assembly expresses Cuba's belief that the content of democracy cannot be limited merely to the exercise of the right to vote—which is almost always false and manipulated by large landowners and professional politicians—but should include the right of citizens to determine their own destiny, as the Cuban People's National Assembly is doing now.
    Furthermore, democracy can only exist in the Americas when the peoples of various countries can truly choose freely, only when the poor are not in the most deadly state of powerlessness due to hunger, social inequality, illiteracy, and the judicial system.
    Therefore, the Cuban People's National Assembly condemns the large estate system, which is the root cause of the poverty of farmers and backward and inhumane agricultural production methods; condemns starvation wages; condemns the cruel exploitation of human labor by distorted privileged interests; condemns illiteracy; condemns the lack of teachers, schools, doctors, and hospitals; condemns the situation of insecurity for the elderly in American countries; condemns discrimination against black people and Indians; condemns unequal treatment and exploitation of women; condemns the military and political oligarchies that keep our countries in poverty and prevent the democratic development and full exercise of their sovereignty; condemns the transfer of our countries' natural resources to foreign monopoly groups, considering this a policy of surrender and betrayal of the people's interests; condemns governments that comply with Washington's instructions, ignoring the feelings of their own people; condemns the series of deceptions of the peoples by propaganda organizations that represent the interests of the oligarchy and the oppressors of imperialism; condemns the monopoly of news by American news agencies, which are tools of American trusts and agents of Washington; condemns repressive laws that prevent the vast majority of people, workers, farmers, students, and intellectuals from organizing to fight for their social and patriotic rights and interests; condemns imperialist monopoly capital and imperialist enterprises, which constantly plunder our wealth, exploit our workers and farmers, suck the blood of our economy, and keep our economy in a backward state, making the politics of Latin American countries subservient to their schemes and interests. Finally, the Cuban People's National Assembly condemns the human exploitation and the exploitation of underdeveloped countries by imperialist financial capital. Therefore, the Cuban People's National Assembly announces to the Americas: Farmers have the right to obtain land, workers have the right to enjoy the fruits of their labor, children have the right to receive education, the sick have the right to receive medical care, young people have the right to work, students have the right to receive free and experimental scientific education, black people and Indians have the right to fully enjoy human dignity, women have equal civil, political, and social rights, the elderly have the right to spend their old age in peace, intellectuals, artists, and scientists have the right to fight for a better world with their own labor, countries have the right to nationalize imperialist monopoly organizations to recover their national resources and wealth; countries have the right to trade freely with all countries in the world; countries have the right to fully exercise their sovereignty; the peoples of various countries have the right to turn their barracks into schools, and to hand over weapons to their workers, farmers, students, intellectuals, black people, Indians, women, young people, old people, and all oppressed and exploited people so that they can defend their rights and their destiny themselves. The Cuban People's National Assembly believes that workers, farmers, students, intellectuals, black people, Indians, young people, women, and old people should fight for their economic, political, and social rights and interests; oppressed and exploited nations should fight for their liberation; the people of each country should support the peoples of all oppressed, colonized, and aggressed countries, regardless of where these countries are in the world and how far away they are. The peoples of the world are brothers! The Cuban People's National Assembly reiterates its belief that Latin America will soon unite, break free from the shackles imposed upon them, and advance victoriously, these shackles now making Latin America's economy a wealth controlled by U.S. imperialism, preventing Latin America from voicing their true voices at conferences, where tamed foreign ministers shamelessly echo their domineering masters. Therefore, the Assembly reiterates its determination to fight for the common destiny of Latin America, which will enable our countries to establish true unity on the basis of the free will of each country and in accordance with the common aspirations of all countries. Today, in the struggle for a liberated Latin America, facing the obsequiousness of those who have usurped official representation, the true voice of the people resounds with irresistible force, coming from within its coal and tin mines, from its factories and sugar mills, from its lands subjected to feudal rule. There, the Rotochuculos, the Gauchus, the Jivaros—the successors of Zapata and Sandino—have taken up the weapons of freedom. This cry echoes in their poetry and novels, resonates in the hearts of their students, women, children, and their restless elders. The Cuban People's National Assembly's response to this fraternal cry is: Yes! Cuba will never fail! Today, Cuba is here, reaffirming its unwavering maxim before Latin America and the world as a historic vow: To defend the motherland to the death! The Cuban People's National Assembly decides that this declaration shall be made public under the name of the Havana Declaration."

### 古巴人民全国大会“哈瓦那宣言”全文

    古巴人民全国大会“哈瓦那宣言”全文
    本报讯　9月2日在哈瓦那举行的古巴人民全国大会通过的“哈瓦那宣言”全文如下：
    “在美洲自由的土地古巴，在何塞·马蒂的形象的旁边并怀着对他的怀念，人民有效地行使其体现为直接普遍的人民公决的主权，行使其由此产生的不可让步的权力，兹组成全国大会。
    古巴人民全国大会代表自己并集中了我们的美洲各国人民的感情表示，第一，谴责所谓哥斯达黎加圣约瑟宣言的一切方面，这是一个美帝国主义强加的、侵犯大陆兄弟人民的民族自决权、主权和尊严的文件。
    第二：古巴人民全国大会强烈谴责美帝国主义一个多世纪来对拉丁美洲各国人民的明目张胆的罪恶干涉；各国人民不止一次地从墨西哥、尼加拉瓜、海地、多米尼加和古巴的例子看到他们的土地被侵犯，他们在美帝国主义贪得无餍的掠夺下失去了像得克萨斯这样的大片富饶的土地，像巴拿马运河这样重要的战略中心，一些国家，如波多黎各，整个沦亡，变成被占领的地区。此外他们还遭到海军陆战队对我们的妻子和女儿以及对像何塞·马蒂的形象这样祖国历史的最高标志的侮辱。
    这种依靠了军事优势、不平等条约和卖国统治者的卑躬屈节实现的干涉，使我们的美洲——博利瓦尔、伊达尔哥、胡亚雷斯、圣马丁、沃伊京斯、苏克雷和马蒂期望取得自由的美洲——一百多年来沦为被剥削的地区、沦为美国政治金融帝国的后院、国际机构中的举手机器，我们拉丁美洲国家在这些国际机构中成了‘我们所鄙视的嚣张残暴的北方国家’的奴隶。
    古巴人民全国大会宣布，正式代表拉丁美洲各国的政府接受这种连续不断的、历史上无可置辩的干涉，就是背叛了它们本国人民的独立理想，勾消它们的主权，妨碍我们各国的真正团结；因此我们这次大会不得不以古巴人民的名义，发出体现了拉丁美洲各国人民的希望和决心的呼声，用我们美洲不朽的伟人们求解放的语调对此加以谴责。
    古巴人民全国大会同时谴责保持门罗主义的企图，正如马蒂所预见那样，这个主义直到今天一直被利用来扩大贪婪无餍的帝国主义者在美洲的统治，用来更好地注射何塞·马蒂也曾经及时地谴责过的毒素——贷款、运河和铁路的毒素。
    因此，为了对抗虚伪的泛美主义（这种主义只不过代表美国垄断资本对我们各国人民利益的控制，代表美国对落后于华盛顿的政府的操纵），古巴人民全国大会宣布何塞·马蒂和本尼托·胡亚雷斯所主张的解放的拉丁美洲主义。大会对美国人民、对黑人受到私刑、知识分子受到迫害、工人被迫受盗匪指挥的国家的人民表示友好，并重申同全世界而不是同世界的一部分一起前进的意志。
    古巴人民全国大会宣布，苏联自愿建议一旦我们的国家受到帝国主义武装力量袭击时给予我们援助的做法，绝不能视为干涉行为，而是一个明显的支援行动，这种在美国五角大楼即将发动攻击的情况下给予古巴的援助，一方面使提供援助的苏联政府显得光荣，另一方面也使美国政府对古巴的卑怯的罪恶的侵略行为显得可耻。
    因此：古巴人民全国大会向美洲和全世界宣布，接受苏联在一旦古巴领土遭到美国武装力量袭击时所给予的火箭支援，并对此表示感谢。
    古巴人民全国大会坚决否认，苏联和中华人民共和国曾有过丝毫想利用古巴的经济、政治和社会地位来破坏大陆团结和威胁本半球团结的企图。
    古巴人民从放第一枪到最后的一枪，从在为推翻暴政统治和取得革命政权而进行的斗争中牺牲的二万先烈中的第一人到最后一人，从颁布第一次革命法律到最近的一项革命法律，从第一次革命行动到最近一次革命行动，都是根据他们完全自由的决定采取行动的，因此永远也不能把存在一次革命归罪于苏联和中华人民共和国，这个革命是古巴对帝国主义在美洲造成的罪恶和不合理现象的最好的回答。
    相反，古巴人民全国大会认为，美国政府宣扬和强加给拉丁美洲各国政府的孤立和敌视苏联和中华人民共和国的政策，美国政府的好战的、侵略的行为和一贯拒绝中华人民共和国进入联合国，而不管中华人民共和国代表着一个拥有六亿多人口的几乎整个国家的态度，的确威胁着本半球和世界的和平与安全。
    因此，古巴人民全国大会批准它和全世界人民友好的政策，重申它也和一切社会主义国家建立外交关系的意愿，并且从现在起，运用它的主权和自由意志，向中华人民共和国表示愿意在两国之间建立外交关系，因此，要断绝到今天为止古巴还和福摩萨的美国第七舰队支持下的傀儡政权保持着的关系。
    古巴人民全国大会重申，民主是同财政寡头不相容的、同对黑人的歧视、三K党的横行不法不相容的，是同解除奥本海默等科学家的职务，多年来把保罗·罗伯逊软禁在国内、阻止全世界听到他美妙的声音，不顾全世界的惊愕和抗议、不顾各国执政者甚至教皇庇护十二世的呼吁而悍然处死罗森堡夫妇等等迫害行为是不相容的。
    古巴人民全国大会表示古巴的信念，认为民主的内容不能仅仅限于行使选举权——这几乎永远是虚假的，是由大庄园主和职业政客操纵的——而应包括公民决定自己命运的权利，就像古巴人民全国大会现在要做那样。
    此外，只有当各国人民真正能够自由选择，只有当贫苦人不因饥饿、社会不平等、文盲状态和司法制度而处于最致命的无力地位时，民主才可能在美洲存在。
    因此，古巴人民全国大会谴责大庄园制度，这是农民贫穷的根源，是落后和不人道的农业生产方式；谴责饥饿工资，谴责畸形的特权利益对人类劳动的凶残剥削；谴责文盲，谴责缺乏教师、学校、医生和医院的状况；谴责美洲各国老年人得不到保障的状况；谴责对黑人和印第安人的歧视；谴责对妇女的不平等待遇和剥削；谴责使我们各国人民处于贫困状态、阻止各国的民主发展和完全行使自己的主权的军事和政治寡头统治；谴责把我们各国的自然资源出让给外国垄断集团，认为这是投降和背叛人民利益的政策；谴责遵从华盛顿的指令无视自己人民的感情的政府；谴责代表寡头统治的利益和帝国主义压迫者的政策的宣传机构对各国人民进行的一系列的欺骗；谴责美国通讯社垄断新闻，它们是美国托辣斯的工具和华盛顿的代理人；谴责镇压法律，这些法律阻止各国绝大多数人民、工人、农民、学生和知识分子组织起来为争取自己的社会和爱国主义的权益的斗争；谴责帝国主义垄断资本和帝国主义企业，它们不断掠夺我们的财富，剥削我们的工人和农民，吮吸我们经济的血液并使我们的经济继续处于落后状态，使拉丁美洲的政治屈从它们的图谋和利益。最后，古巴人民全国大会谴责人对人的剥削和帝国主义金融资本对不发达国家的剥削。因此，古巴人民全国大会向美洲宣布：农民有取得土地的权利，工人有享有他们劳动果实的权利，孩子们有受教育的权利，生病的人有享受医疗的权利，青年有工作的权利，学生有受自由的、实验的科学的教育的权利，黑人和印第安人有充分享受人类尊严的权利，妇女有平等的公民、政治和社会权利，老人有安定地度过晚年的权利，知识分子、艺术家和科学家有以他们自己的劳动为更美好的世界而斗争的权利，各国有把帝国主义垄断组织收归国有以收回他们的民族资源和财富的权利；各国有与世界一切国家自由贸易的权利；各国有充分行使主权的权利；各国人民有把他们的军营变成学校，以及把武器交给他们的工人、农民、学生、知识分子、黑人、印第安人、妇女、青年、老人和一切受压迫和受剥削的人们，以便由他们自己来保卫他们的权利和他们的命运的权利。古巴人民全国大会认为，工人、农民、学生、知识分子、黑人、印第安人、青年、妇女、老人应为争取他们的经济、政治和社会的权益而斗争；受压迫、受剥削的民族应为争取他们的解放而斗争；每个国家的人民应该支援所有遭受压迫的、处于殖民地地位和受侵略的国家的人民而不管这些国家在世界上的什么地方以及他们相距多远。全世界人民是兄弟！古巴人民全国大会重申它的信念：拉丁美洲很快就将团结在一起，摆脱对他们的束缚，胜利前进，这些束缚现在使拉丁美洲的经济变为受美帝国主义控制的财富，阻止拉丁美洲在会议上发出他们真实的声音，在这些会议上驯服的外长们无耻地附和专横的主子。因此，大会重申它为了拉丁美洲的共同命运而奋斗的决心，这种共同命运将使得我们各国有可能在每个国家的自由意志的基础上，按照所有国家的共同愿望，建立起真正的团结。今天，在争取一个解放的拉丁美洲的斗争中，面对那些篡夺了官方代表权的人们的唯唯诺诺，真正的人民的声音以不可抗拒的声势震响着，这种声音来自它的煤矿和锡矿的内部，来自它的工厂和制糖厂，来自它的遭受封建统治的土地。在那里，罗托丘洛人、高丘人、希瓦罗人—萨帕塔和桑地诺的后继者们拿起了自由的武器。这种呼声在他们的诗歌里和小说里回响着，在他们的学生、妇女、孩子和他们的未能安眠的老人的心中共鸣着。对于这种兄弟的呼声古巴人民全国大会的回答是：有！古巴决不会失败！今天古巴在这里，在拉丁美洲和全世界面前作为历史性的誓言重申它的不可动摇的箴言：誓死保卫祖国！古巴人民全国大会决定：这个宣言将以哈瓦那宣言名字公诸于世。”
