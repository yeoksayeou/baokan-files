An Epic of a Great Revolutionary Fighter
    Gao Han
    "Fragments of Chairman Ho Chi Minh's Revolutionary Activities" is a truly moving and excellent documentary. It is undoubtedly a joy to watch such a good film during the celebration of the 15th anniversary of the liberation of Vietnam.

    "Fragments of Chairman Ho Chi Minh's Revolutionary Activities" is an epic of a great proletarian revolutionary fighter, and in a sense, it is also an epic of the Vietnamese people's struggle to break free from their colonial fate and achieve national liberation. It summarizes the main activities of this world-renowned proletarian revolutionary in nearly fifty years. For the sake of Vietnam's national independence, Chairman Ho Chi Minh resolutely rose up to fight the fierce imperialist bandits. Relying on the broad masses of the people and adhering to armed struggle, he finally shattered the shackles of French imperialism and achieved the victory of national independence. Now, he is confidently leading the Vietnamese people in building socialism, guarding the southern gateway of the socialist camp, and continuing to oppose the American imperialism and its running dog Ngo Dinh Diem, who are still entrenched in southern Vietnam, and fighting for the reunification of the motherland.

    The film gives a relatively full account of the formation and development of Chairman Ho Chi Minh's revolutionary thought. Chairman Ho Chi Minh grew up in the era when the Nguyen Dynasty of Vietnam sold the country to French imperialism. The cruel rule of feudalism and imperialism forced him to leave his hometown and work under an assumed name as a cook on a ship, traveling to various countries around the world to seek a way to save the country and the people. He was only twenty-one years old at the time. In France, he saw a large number of unemployed and oppressed working people, just like in Vietnam. He wondered why the French colonists did not first "civilize" their own country, but instead came to "civilize" Vietnam. In the United States, although he saw the towering Statue of Liberty, he also saw prisons imprisoning working people; the Ku Klux Klan openly burned and flayed black people alive without anyone caring. In Africa, the black people he saw were simply the cattle and horses of the "developers" from Europe; when they rose up in resistance, they were met with brutal beatings, imprisonment, and killing. Seeing all this, he realized more clearly that there were originally two kinds of people in the world, one was the oppressor, and the other was the oppressed.

    The First World War broke out in 1914. French imperialism plundered 100,000 soldiers and 500,000 tons of grain from Vietnam. Anger burned in Ho Chi Minh's heart. He actively joined the international communist movement and used various opportunities to fight for the freedom and independence of his motherland. The victory of the Russian October Revolution greatly encouraged him. In 1923, he secretly came to the Soviet Union. At that time, he could not restrain his inner joy and pointed out in the book "The Revolutionary Road": "The most genuine, most reliable, and most revolutionary doctrine is Leninism." The film uses many precious historical materials to give a vivid and detailed narrative of such a complex process of ideological development.

    The film focuses on the revolutionary activities of Chairman Ho Chi Minh after Indochina was occupied by Japanese imperialism, when he returned to his motherland and liberated it. He organized the people's armed forces and took advantage of the collapse of German and Japanese fascism in 1945 to launch a general uprising on August 19, seizing power; on September 2, he solemnly read the "Declaration of Independence" on Ba Dinh Square on behalf of the entire nation. Like all reactionaries, French imperialism would never automatically hand over its vested interests and shamelessly launched the dirty Indochina colonial war. Thus, the Vietnamese revolution entered a difficult stage of decisive battle. The film successfully portrays Chairman Ho's heroic image during this period, relying on the masses, enduring hardships, standing tall and unyielding, and adhering to the struggle. The Dien Bien Phu battle ended this nine-year war with a brilliant victory. The filmmakers used the people's heartfelt enthusiasm to shout "Vietnam - Ho Chi Minh - Dien Bien Phu" to praise this great leader.

    The film successfully shows that Chairman Ho Chi Minh is not only an outstanding patriot but also an outstanding internationalist. In his early years, he was a participant and supporter of the French working-class revolutionary movement and an active activist in the Communist International. In 1924, he came to China and had a profound relationship with our country's revolution. After the establishment of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, he had deep friendships with the leaders and people of many countries.

    The life of this proletarian revolutionary, like his revolutionary career, is glorious and moving. The film devotes considerable space to describing his noble character of advocating frugality, diligently studying, selflessly serving the public, and being as close to the people as flesh and blood, introducing the mountain cave and airy bamboo house where he lived during the war years, as well as the extremely simple room and clothing he uses now. It can be said that these are as simple as the truth. The film uses some details that seem to be trivial matters of life to profoundly show the inner world of this revolutionary. We can clearly see his great character of "willing to be an ox for the children" from the scenes of him washing his feet by the river, playing with children, and talking to peasant women.

    This is a rich and refreshing epic. It provides us with a glorious example to learn from. It lets us understand how a proletarian revolutionary fighter should live. At the same time, it provides us with a living chapter of the principles of Marxism-Leninism. It lets us understand what path an oppressed nation that has been reduced to a colony must take to truly achieve liberation. The film has given powerful answers to whether to tolerate or resist imperialism, and whether national liberation should be begged and waited for, or relied on the people's masses to carry out unremitting struggles. Therefore, this film has profound practical significance and educational value. (Attached picture)

    一篇伟大革命斗士的史诗
    高汉
    《胡志明主席革命活动片断》是一部真实动人的好纪录片。在庆祝越南解放十五周年的佳节里，看这样的好影片，无疑是一种幸福。
    《胡志明主席革命活动片断》是一篇无产阶级伟大革命斗士的史诗，在某种意义上说，也是越南人民摆脱殖民地命运，求得民族解放的史诗。它概括了这位世界闻名的无产阶级革命家在近五十年内的主要活动。为了越南的民族独立，胡志明主席毅然起来向凶恶的帝国主义强盗应战。他依靠广大的人民群众，坚持武装斗争，终于粉碎了法帝国主义的枷锁，取得了民族独立的胜利。现在，他正满怀信心地领导越南人民建设社会主义，守卫着社会主义阵营的南方门户，继续反对还盘踞在越南南部的美帝国主义及其走狗吴庭艳，为统一祖国而斗争。
    影片对胡志明主席革命思想的形成和发展，作了比较充分的介绍。胡志明主席生长在越南阮氏皇朝把祖国出卖给法帝国主义的年代。封建主义和帝国主义的残酷统治迫使他背井离乡，化名在轮船上当伙伕，旅行世界各国，寻求救国救民的道路。当时他只有二十一岁。在法国，他看到了同越南国内一样的大批的失业者和被压迫的劳动群众。他奇怪法国殖民者为什么不首先“开化”本国，反而要来“开化”越南。在美国，他虽然看到有耸立的自
  由神雕像，同时，却看到一座座监禁劳动人民的监狱；三Ｋ党明目张胆地把黑人烧死、剐死而无人过问。在非洲，他看到的黑人简直就是来自欧洲的“开发者”的牛马；他们起来反抗，得到的却是残暴的鞭打、监禁和杀戮。他看到这一切，更加清楚地明白：世界上原来有两种人，一种是压迫者，另一种是被压迫者。
    1914年第一次世界大战爆发。法帝国主义从越南掠夺了十万士兵和五十万吨粮食。愤怒在胡志明心中燃烧。他积极地加入了国际共产主义运动，利用各种机会为祖国的自由独立而奋斗。俄国十月革命的胜利使他得到了极大的鼓舞。1923年，他秘密地来到了苏联。当时他抑制不住内心的喜悦，在《革命的道路》一书中指出：“最真正、最可靠和最革命的主义，是列宁主义。”影片利用许多珍贵的历史资料把这样一个复杂的思想发展过程，作了生动细致的叙述。
    影片所着重描写的，是胡志明主席在印度支那
  被日本帝国主义占领以后，回到祖国、解放祖国时期
  的革命活动。他组织了人民武装，利用1945年德日法西斯崩溃的机会，于8月19日举行总起义，夺取了政权；9月2日，在巴亭广场代表全民宣读了庄严的
  《独立宣言》。法帝国主义同一切反动派一样，决不会
  自动地交出既得利益，恬不知耻地发动了肮脏的印度支那殖民战争。于是越南的革命进入了艰巨的决战阶段。影片成功地表现了这一期间胡主席依靠群众，含辛茹苦，威武不屈，坚持斗争的英雄形象。奠边府一战以辉煌的胜利结束了这场历时九年的战争。影片作者用人民的发自内心的热忱喊出了“越南——胡志明——奠边府”，以歌颂这位伟大领袖。
    影片成功地写出了胡志明主席是一位杰出的爱国主义者，同时又是一位杰出的国际主义者。早年他是法国工人阶级革命运动的参加者和支持者；是共产国际的积极活动家。1924年，他曾来到中国，和我国的革命有过深刻的关系。越南民主共和国成立以后，他同许多国家的领袖和人民之间，有着很深切的友谊。
    这位无产阶级革命家的生活同他的革命事业一样，都是光辉动人的。影片以相当篇幅描写了他那崇尚俭朴、好学不倦、舍己为公、同人民亲如骨肉的高尚品德，介绍了他在战争年代住过的山洞和四面通风的竹楼，也介绍了他现在所用的极简单的居室和衣履。可以说，这些都跟真理一样朴素。影片用了一些看来似乎是生活琐事的细节，深刻地展示了这位革命家的内心世界。我们可以从他在河边洗脚，跟孩子们嬉游和同农妇谈心等镜头中清清楚楚地看到他那种“俯首甘为孺子牛”的伟大性格。
    这是一篇丰富清新的史诗。它给我们每个人提供了一个光辉的学习榜样。它让我们了解，作为一个无产阶级的革命斗士，应该怎样生活。同时，它又给我们提供了一章活的马克思列宁主义的原理。它让我们了解一个已经沦为殖民地的被压迫民族必须走哪样的道路才能真正获得解放。对帝国主义是忍让还是反抗，要民族解放是乞求等待还是依靠人民群众进行不懈的战斗，影片都已作了有力的回答。因此这部影片具有深刻的现实意义和教育作用。（附图片）
