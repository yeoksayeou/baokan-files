Promote Rice Bran Oil Extraction
By a commentator of this newspaper

    Today, this newspaper publishes news about the widespread rice bran oil extraction activities in various parts of Guangdong, which shows that the utilization of rice bran for oil extraction not only greatly expands the scope of rice bran utilization and increases its economic value, but also expands the source of edible oil needed by the general public.

    Rice bran is a by-product of milling rice. It contains a large number of nutrients, which is well known. According to scientific tests, rice bran contains 14% to 21% fat, 12% to 15% protein, 6.5% to 7.5% crude fiber, 8% to 12% water, and 9% to 11% ash. In addition, it also contains a large amount of vitamin B, vitamin E, and lipase. Therefore, rice bran can not only be used for oil extraction, but also the bran cake after oil extraction can be used to make maltose, brew white wine, and produce various chemical raw materials and vitamins. The distiller's grains after oil extraction and brewing can also be used to feed pigs, and the oil foot after refining edible oil can be used to make various industrial oils. It can be said that rice bran is a treasure with infinite value.

    However, not everyone has a clear understanding of the comprehensive utilization of rice bran. Some people, when they mention increasing the source of edible oil, only think of expanding the planting of oil crops, and rarely, or not at all, think of finding substitutes from various aspects. Of course, doing everything possible to plant more peanuts, sesame, sunflower, and other vegetable oil crops is, and will continue to be, the main aspect and fundamental measure for us to increase the source of edible oil. In recent years, the output of oil crops in our country has increased significantly. In the future, we must continue to expand the production of oil crops to meet the needs of the people's ever-improving lives. However, for a large country with a large population like ours, we must also rely on other methods to utilize everything that can be used. China's rice production accounts for a large proportion of grain production, and a large amount of rice bran can be used every year. While vigorously increasing the production of oil crops, relying on the method of widely using rice bran for oil extraction is the most realistic and effective way to open up new oil sources. Relying on rice bran oil extraction can increase edible oil production and increase a large number of other industrial raw materials. Precisely because of this, we must extract more edible oil from rice bran. Hunan Province was the first to discover the treasure of rice bran. The significant achievements of Guangdong have provided us with a good example.

    Will rice bran oil extraction and brewing reduce the nutritional value of feed and hinder the development of the pig industry? No. According to scientific tests and precise analysis by relevant departments, the bran cake after oil extraction and brewing can completely meet the needs of pigs. At the same time, in the process of oil extraction and brewing, the fiber of the bran is softened after steaming and fermentation, which is more conducive to the appetite and digestion of pigs. After comprehensive utilization of rice bran, the supply of feed will of course be reduced. For this situation, we should comprehensively consider the overall situation and not isolate the reduction of feed. Now, while comprehensively utilizing rice bran, many places are combining diversified operations to vigorously carry out the comprehensive processing of agricultural and sideline products, so that many things that could not be used as feed before have become feed, and many rough feeds have become fine feeds, thereby increasing the source of feed. The losses after the comprehensive utilization of rice bran can be completely compensated by other methods. Dongguan County in Guangdong, which was the earliest to use rice bran for oil extraction and the largest in terms of utilization, is a good proof that the number of pigs raised in the first half of this year increased by more than 35% compared with the number of pigs at the end of last year.

    Learning from Guangdong's experience and launching rice bran oil extraction work by carrying out mass movements is a good way to increase production and practice economy at present.

    推广米糠榨油
    本报评论员
    今天，本报发表的广东各地广泛开展米糠榨油的消息，说明利用米糠榨油，不仅大大扩大了米糠的使用范围，提高了米糠的经济价值，而且扩大了为广大人民群众所需要的食油的来源。
    米糠是稻谷碾成白米时的副产品。其中含有大量营养剂，这是人所共知的。据科学化验，米糠中含有脂肪14％到21％、蛋白质12％到15％、粗纤维6.5％到7.5％、水8％到12％、灰9％到11％。此外，还含有大量的维生素乙、维生素戊和解脂素等等。因此，米糠不仅可以用来榨油，而且榨油以后的糠饼还可以制饴糖、酿白酒，制作各种化工原料和维生素。在榨油、酿酒之后的酒糟，还可以用来喂猪，提炼食油后的油脚又可做各种工业用油，真可以说是米糠一身全是宝，价值无穷。
    但是，对于米糠的综合利用，并不是所有的人都认识得很清楚的。有的人一提到增加食油来源，就只会从扩大油料作物的种植方面去想问题，很少、或者根本不想从各方面去找代用品。当然，尽一切可能多种花生、芝麻、向日葵和其他植物油料作物，现在是，将来也是我们增加食油来源的主要方面和根本措施。几年来，我国的油料作物产量已经有了不少的增长，今后我们还要不断地扩大油料作物的生产，以适应人民生活不断提高的需要。但是，对于我们这样一个人口众多的大国来说，还必须依靠其他方法，把能够用的东西统统利用起来。我国的稻谷产量，在粮食生产上占有很大比重，每年都有大量的米糠可以利用，在大力增产油料作物的同时，依靠广泛利用米糠榨油这个办法，就是开辟新的油料来源的一条最现实最有效的办法。依靠米糠榨油，就可以增加食油产量，就可以增加大批其他工业原料。正因为如此，所以我们必须向米糠索取更多的食油。这一点，湖南省曾经首次发现米糠的宝藏。广东取得的重大成绩，又为我们提供了良好的范例。
    米糠榨油、酿酒以后，会不会降低饲料营养价值，妨碍生猪事业的发展？不会。据有关部门的科学化验和精确分析，榨油和酿酒以后的糠饼，完全可以满足猪的需要。同时，米糠在榨油和酿酒过程中，经过蒸煮和发酵，糠的纤维质软化，更有助于猪的食欲和消化。米糠经过综合利用以后，当然要减少饲料的供应，对于这种情况，我们应该全面地算大账，不能孤立地只看饲料的减少。现在，许多地方在综合利用米糠的同时，结合多种经营，大力开展对农副产品的综合加工，使很多原来不能做饲料的东西变成了饲料，使很多粗饲料变成了精饲料，从而增加了饲料的来源。米糠综合利用以后的损耗，完全可以用其他方法来弥补。广东利用米糠榨油最早、利用数量最多的东莞县，今年上半年养猪数量比去年底存栏数量增加35％以上的事实就是一个最好的证明。
    学广东的经验，用大搞群众运动的办法，开展米糠榨油工作，这是当前增产节约的一个好办法。
