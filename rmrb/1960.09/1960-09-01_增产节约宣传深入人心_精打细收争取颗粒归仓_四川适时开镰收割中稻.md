　　Sichuan Appropriately Begins Reaping Mid-Season Rice
　　Guizhou's Ten Counties Harvest Early-Maturing Crops; Xingren and Rongjiang Counties Strive for Another Grain Harvest

　　Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, August 31st. Sichuan Province has comprehensively begun harvesting mid-season rice.

　　Before the mid-season rice harvest, Party committee secretaries at all levels personally took action, organizing cadres and commune members to study documents related to the Increase Production and Practice Economy movement. Extensive propaganda and educational activities were carried out. Therefore, from the start of the harvest, the broad masses of commune members paid attention to careful harvesting and threshing, striving to ensure every grain is returned to the granary.

　　Seizing the season and harvesting at the appropriate time is a measure taken by various regions to reduce grain scattering. Currently, because all regions have mobilized over 80% of their labor force to the front lines of agricultural production, they generally arrange labor according to the planting time and different varieties of crops, ensuring that the early-maturing crops are harvested first, and the late-maturing crops are harvested later, harvesting one plot at a time as it ripens. Many communes in Yibin, Jiangjin, and other regions with earlier seasons have already completed the timely and careful harvesting of mid-season rice by late August. Various regions have also universally improved harvesting methods, conscientiously ensuring careful harvesting and threshing. Chen Guangqian Threshing Group of Huayuan Commune in Yuechi County created the achievement of threshing 30 loads of grain (approximately 100 jin per load) per day with one thresher, with very little grain scattering. After the county Party committee summarized and promoted this experience, it immediately launched a "Red Flag Thresher" competition throughout the county, focusing on improving work efficiency and reducing scattering. Currently, over 1,300 threshers throughout the county are exceeding their quotas every day, and the phenomenon of scattering and waste has been basically eliminated. Nanchong Region promoted twelve experiences of careful harvesting and threshing, also effectively preventing the scattering and waste of grain.

　　During the mid-season rice harvest, various regions also vigorously promoted the use of improved and semi-mechanized harvesting and threshing tools, improving work efficiency, saving labor, and ensuring timely and careful harvesting and threshing.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Guiyang, August 30th. Ten counties in Guizhou Province with warmer climates, such as Rongjiang, Wangmo, and Chishui, have begun harvesting early-maturing crops. Currently, over 265,000 mu of early rice, early corn, and various miscellaneous grain crops have been harvested.

　　Because the People's Communes have strengthened the production teams in terms of leadership and labor, the harvesting work is progressing quickly and carefully, ensuring that one plot is harvested as it ripens. Chishui County organized specialized rush-harvesting teams, implementing a method of assigning personnel, areas, quality, time, and remuneration. By August 20th, they had harvested over 13,000 mu of early rice, corn, and miscellaneous grains. The Central Production Team of Maoshe Commune in Renhuai County, led by the production team leader, formed a specialized corn harvesting team, ensuring that all mature corn was harvested and cleaned up in a timely manner. The interplanted soybeans, mung beans, and other miscellaneous grain crops in the cornfields were also harvested in a timely manner.

　　During the harvest, various regions paid attention to improving technology and using new agricultural tools to improve harvesting quality and speed up the rush-harvesting progress. Baoyuan Commune used a rapid rice harvesting tool, increasing work efficiency by four to five times compared to sickle harvesting. Most communes used threshing machines and corn threshers to thresh grain after harvesting early rice and corn.

　　Many People's Communes also promptly replanted a crop of late-autumn crops after harvesting early-maturing crops. In Xingren County, over 7,900 mu of the 8,700 mu of land where early-maturing crops had been harvested was planted with late-autumn crops. Rongjiang County, with its mild climate, is also cultivating ratooning rice in the first batch of harvested rice paddies, striving to harvest another crop of rice before the autumn planting.

    增产节约宣传深入人心　精打细收争取颗粒归仓
    四川适时开镰收割中稻
    贵州十个县收割早熟作物，兴仁榕江两县力争再收一季粮
    本报成都31日电　四川省全面开始收割中稻。
    中稻收割前，各级党委书记都亲自动手，组织干部、社员学习有关增产节约运动的文件，广泛开展了增产节约的宣传教育活动，因此，收割一开始，广大社员就注意精收细打，力争颗粒归仓。
    抓住季节、适时收割，是各地采取的减少抛撒粮食的一项措施。目前由于各地都调集了80％以上的劳力到农业生产第一线，因而一般都根据作物的栽插时间和不同品种等情况，安排好劳力，做到了先熟先收，后熟后收，熟一块收一块。季节较早的宜宾、江津等专区的许多公社，已在8月下旬适时、精细地将中稻收打完毕。各地还普遍改进了收打方法，认真做到了精收细打。岳池县花园公社陈光前打谷组，创造了一架拌桶每天打谷三十挑（每挑约百斤），并且很少抛撒粮食的成绩，县委总结和推广了这个经验以后，立即在全县开展了以提高工效和减少抛撒为中心的“红旗拌桶”竞赛运动，目前，全县已有一千三百多架拌桶天天突破定额，并基本上消除了抛撒浪费现象。南充专区推广了精收细打的十二条经验，也有效地防止了粮食的抛撒浪费。
    在收打中稻期间，各地还大力推广使用改良和半机械化的收割、脱粒工具，提高工效，节约劳力，保证了适时精收细打。
    新华社贵阳30日电　贵州省气候较热的榕江、望谟、赤水等十个县，已经开始收割早熟作物。目前早稻、早玉米和各种杂粮作物已收割二十六万五千多亩。
    由于人民公社从领导力量、劳动力等方面加强了生产小队，收割工作进行得又快又细，作到了黄一块、收一块。赤水县组织抢收专业队，实行定人员、定地区、定质量、定时间、定报酬的办法，到8月20日止，已收早稻、玉米、杂粮一万三千多亩。仁怀县茅舌公社中心生产队，由生产队长领导，组成玉米收获专业队，成熟的玉米全部及时收光打净。对玉米地里套种的黄豆、绿豆等杂粮作物，也及时进行收获。
    收割中，各地注意改进技术和使用新式农具，提高收割质量，加快抢收进度。保元公社使用快速收禾器，比镰刀割稻提高工效四倍到五倍。大部分公社在收割早稻和玉米后，采用打谷机和玉米脱粒机脱粒。
    许多人民公社在早熟作物收获后，还及时抢种一季晚秋作物。兴仁县已收割的八千七百多亩早熟作物土地，有七千九百多亩种上了晚秋作物。气候温和的榕江县还在第一批收割的水稻田里培育再生稻，争取在秋种前再收一次稻谷。
