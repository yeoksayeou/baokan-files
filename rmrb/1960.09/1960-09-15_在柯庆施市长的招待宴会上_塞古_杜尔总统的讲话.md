Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, September 14th: The following is the full text of President Sékou Touré's speech at the reception banquet hosted by Mayor Ke Qingshi of Shanghai: Your Excellency Premier, Mr. Mayor, ladies and gentlemen, dear comrades,

　　As you know, our visit to the People's Republic of China has profound and great significance for the people of African countries and the people of Asian countries. Within the Afro-Asian collective, the people of Africa and Asia are engaged in a fierce struggle to accelerate the movement for human liberation led by the working classes in these two regions of the world. This is because the people of these two regions have experienced the humiliation of heavy exploitation and oppression in the long past.

　　We have talked about the significance of the great Chinese people's contribution to accelerating the movement for political, economic, and social liberation of the people of all countries that have suffered from imperialism and colonial rule; we have also pointed out that the process of change completed in your country's history is also a process underway on the African continent, although the mutual conditions are slightly different.

　　Nowhere in the world have people ever willingly accepted colonial rule. In history, no country's people have demonstrated that they are ruled by another system or by a force that does not control them, does not represent their interests, and does not express their ideas, according to their own expressed will.

　　We all know that there is a division between those who possess material means and strive to extend their exploitation and oppression system outside their own countries and impose colonial rule on materially weak countries, and the colonized countries who originally possessed legitimate conditions to develop normally according to their own traditions in order to maintain their characteristics and promote their material, moral, and cultural values. We all know that the aforementioned division produced by capitalism in its imperialist or colonialist continued development continues to divide the world; but history has proven that no system, no matter how strong it is, can perpetually impose itself on the people of another country if the people do not accept it or deem it unacceptable.

　　Imperialism possesses what people used to call standards of power, that is, military forces, technology, money, transportation, and the means to carry out oppression in fact. However, today, imperialism is retreating steadily, mainly because of its nature that is absolutely contrary to the free will of the people of all countries, its nature that is opposed to the normal development of the people of all countries, and its nature that opposes the unity and progress of the people of all countries.

　　Imperialism, in the name of so-called civilization, once ruled us. Imperialists, in the name of freedom, turned us into slaves; in the name of democracy, they established all kinds of discrimination in our countries; in the name of progress, they destroyed the normal development of our countries. The values, principles, and propositions they provided for our development could only cause our people to lose their character, harm the normal development of our civilization, and the evolution of our society. However, this exploitation and oppression also stirred up reactions among the people, so resistance to exploitation and oppression appeared everywhere; therefore, new criteria for measuring value were generated everywhere, and struggles were organized.

　　Regardless of the intensity of this struggle, it is certain that all colonized people have struggled in different forms to regain their freedom and exercise their sovereignty.

　　However, the views of the Chinese people and the people of African countries are consistent not only on this point; there is also the experience we have accumulated, which shows us that the struggle against colonial rule and against imperialism must be developed into a struggle for social liberation for the people of our countries, so that imperialists and colonialists can no longer continue to play their old tricks, after formally declaring independence, through certain people, governments, or vested interest classes. Therefore, what unites us is also our desire to give all our organizations, especially our countries, a popular and democratic character.

　　However, in addition to the fact that the people must move towards the path of political, economic, social, and cultural liberation, there is another common characteristic of the policies we pursue, that is: the willingness to defend world peace, the willingness to contribute to building a new world and avoiding poverty, and the willingness to create a new civilization, the starting point, goal, and ultimate purpose of which is always the welfare of the people.

　　The revolutionary human nature of the revolutions currently taking place in Asia, Africa, and Latin America demonstrates the indisputable superiority of our mission, and everything the imperialists do is detrimental to the interests of the people of all countries. We want to thank the Chinese people for their many expressions of sympathy and trust for the future of Africa. We can assure the Chinese people that, despite the best efforts of the imperialists to build a chasm between Asia and Africa, attempting to isolate Asia and Africa, thereby weakening the ranks of revolutionaries, you can absolutely trust the political maturity of your African brothers and companions, because they, like you, have learned the same lessons, know what it means for imperialism to destroy one's character, what the imperialists' values mean, and we are confident that the guidelines directing our activities will lead to the same focal point, namely: to rebuild a front of awakened peoples to save humanity. We are confident that this problem can be solved.

　　We have said: there is no revolution without awareness, no aware revolution. This awareness exists in Asia and in Africa, not only because of the harsh living conditions that the imperialists have imposed on us, but also because of an objective analysis of the enormous possibilities, especially the enormous possibilities offered to us by our united struggle, the courage we have mustered in our struggle to renovate our economy and culture. This existing awareness will overcome all negative factors, will frustrate all conspiracies aimed at sowing discord, and will make all threats, even all aggression, unable to succeed; because the awareness of the new world has reached such a degree that force can no longer override reason and justice; and it is precisely for this reason that reactionary forces no longer have the possibility of deceiving people as the colonial rulers did in the old days.

　　We know what your current contribution to the African liberation movement means. We can also say to you: the struggle currently taking place in Africa has the same beneficial impact on Asia, Latin America, and the exploited classes in Europe, and your struggle has had a beneficial impact on life in Africa.

　　Therefore, our interdependence is a fact, and this fact is understood by all of us. When we visit your country, the reason why we want to express our willingness to cooperate with you, the reason why we want to express our efforts to strengthen the foundation of our friendship, is precisely because we know that without cooperation and understanding between your people and our people, without this concerted action, imperialism may still become a dangerous threat to each of us. Therefore, the only way to finally defeat imperialism, the only way to create an era of prosperity and peace, is for all exploited people, all proletarian countries, whether liberated or unliberated, to bravely take concerted action to stop the reactionary tide that brings disaster to mankind.

　　This factor that connects us is recognized by us; we must develop our concerted action. We are very happy that the signing of various agreements between the two countries has created new strength between the Chinese people and government and the Guinean people and government. We have said that Guinea will faithfully and firmly do its best to not only maintain the economic and cultural agreements, but also develop them as quickly as possible.

　　We are very happy to see messengers of the African labor world in this city of Shanghai, to meet qualified representatives of the working class, and teachers who participated in the major conference held in Conakry, representatives of the international movement of teachers who participated in this conference. We are confident that the greetings they have conveyed or will convey to you in the name of the people of our countries will be exactly the greetings that our delegation wants to convey, because we have the same intentions.

　　The reason why the people of some African countries have not yet established diplomatic relations with the People's Republic of China, or have not yet specifically expressed their admiration and trust in your revolution, is only because colonial rule has prevented them from doing so. But you can be sure that the freedom of Africa will enable it to express its true intentions.

　　You just said that the imperialists see you and us as incompetent people; they were right, we used to be incompetent. The talent of the people of a country is directly proportional to the responsibility they bear for their country; but once the people of all countries have regained their freedom, they show that their talents surpass those of the imperialists. The imperialists' "talent" lies in killing people and destroying cultural and economic development. And the talent of the liberated people and democratic forces is to create life, develop life, build friendship, make peace, consolidate peace, so that humanity can live in dignity and prosperity.

　　While conveying our greetings to you, we want to shout:

　　Long live the eternal, prosperous friendship and trust between the Chinese people and the African people!

　　Long live the peace of all the peoples of all countries, the world, in equal and fraternal cooperation!

    在柯庆施市长的招待宴会上
    塞古·杜尔总统的讲话
    新华社上海14日电　塞古·杜尔总统在上海柯庆施市长的招待宴会上的讲话。全文如下：总理先生阁下，市长先生，女士们、先生们、亲爱的同志们，
    你们知道，我们对中华人民共和国的访问，对于非洲各国人民以及亚洲各国人民，都有深刻的重大意义。非洲同亚洲人民在亚非集体之内，为了加速世界上这两个地区的劳动阶层所领导的争取人类解放的运动，正在进行着剧烈的斗争，这是因为这两个地区的人民，在过去的漫长的岁月中，曾经经历了惨重的剥削和压迫的屈辱。
    我们曾经谈到过：伟大的中国人民对于加速曾经遭受帝国主义和殖民统治的各国人民争取政治、经济和社会解放的运动所作出的贡献的意义何在；我们也已经指出，在贵国人民历史上完成的变革过程，也是在非洲大陆上正在进行的过程，当然相互的条件稍稍有所不同。
    世界上任何地方，从来不曾有过人们愿受殖民统治的事情。在历史上，没有一个国家的人民证明他们受另一种制度的统治或受原来不支配他们、不代表他们的利益、不表达他们的思想的一种力量的统治，是根据他们自己表示的意愿的。
    我们大家知道，在拥有物质手段、力求把自己的剥削和压迫制度扩及自己的国家之外而对物质上软弱的国家实行殖民统治的人们，同原来拥有正当的条件来依据自己的传统得到正常的发展，以便保持自己的特性并发扬自己在物质、道义、和文化方面的价值的遭受殖民统治的各国人民之间，是存在着分歧的。我们大家知道，资本主义在它的帝国主义或殖民主义的延续发展中所产生的上述分歧，继续使世界处于分裂；但是历史已经证明，任何制度，不管它的力量有多大，它决不能持续永恒地强加于别国的人民，如果人民不接受它或者认为不能接受的话。
    帝国主义在拥有人们过去称之谓威力的标准，就是那些军事力量、技术、金钱、交通工具以及在事实上进行压迫的手段。但是，今天，帝国主义之所以节节退却，这主要是由于它同各国人民的自由意志绝对背道而驰的本性、由于它同各国人民的正常发展对立的本性、由于它反对各国人民团结和进步的本性。
    帝国主义以所谓文明的名义，曾经统治过我们。帝国主义者曾经以自由的名义使我们变成奴隶，以民主的名义在我们国家里建立各式各样的歧视，以进步的名义破坏了我们国家的正常发展，他们为我们的发展提供的价值准则以及各项原则和主张，则只能使我国人民丧失自己的性格，危害我们的文明的正常发展和我们社会的进化。然而，这种剥削和压迫同样在人民中间激起了反应，因此到处出现了对剥削和压迫的反抗；因此，到处产生了衡量价值的新准则，斗争也组织起来了。
    不管这种斗争的强烈程度如何，可以肯定的是：所有的殖民地人民都以不同的形式进行了斗争，争取恢复自己的自由和行使自己的主权。
    但是，中国人民和非洲各国人民的见解一致，并不仅仅在这一点上；还有我们所积累起来的经验，这种经验向我们表明：反对殖民统治、反对帝国主义的斗争，必须发展为我们这些国家的人民争取社会解放的斗争，以使帝国主义者和殖民主义者不能再在形式上宣布独立之后，再通过某些人、政府或既得利益阶层，来继续玩弄他们的老一套。所以，把我们联结在一起的，还有我们要对我们的一切组织、特别是我们的国家，赋予它们以人民和民主的性质。
    但是，除了人民要走向政治、经济、社会和文化解放的道路这一方面以外，还有我们所奉行的政策的另外一个共同的特点，那就是：保卫世界和平的意愿，对缔造新世界和为避免贫困而作出贡献的意愿，以及创造新的文明的意愿，而这种文明的出发点、目标和最终目的，始终是人民的福利。
    目前在亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲进行的革命的人道性质，表明了我们的使命的无可争议的优越性，而帝国主义者所作的一切都是不利于各国人民的利益的。我们要感谢中国人民对非洲前途的许多同情和信任的表示。我们可以向中国人民保证，尽管帝国主义者想尽办法要在亚洲和非洲之间筑起一道鸿沟，企图孤立亚洲、孤立非洲，从而削弱革命者的阵营，但是你们可以绝对信任你们的非洲兄弟和同伴们在政治上的成熟，因为他们像你们一样受到了同样的教训，知道帝国主义破坏他的性格意味着什么，帝国主义者的价值准则意味着什么，而且我们确信指导着我们的各项活动的方针将导向同一个中心点，即：重建一个觉悟了的各国人民的阵线，来拯救人类。我们确信，这个问题一定能得到解决。
    我们已经说过：没有觉悟的革命、没有革命觉悟的革命，是不存在的。这种觉悟在亚洲、在非洲都存在，这不仅是因为帝国主义者曾经强加于我们的艰苦生活条件，而且是由于对巨大的可能性作了客观的分析，特别是我们的团结斗争、我们在为争取革新我们的经济与文化而进行的斗争中所鼓起的勇气，为我们提供了巨大的可能性。这种存在着的觉悟将克服一切消极因素，将挫败一切旨在挑拨离间的阴谋，将使一切威胁，甚至使一切侵略都不能得逞；因为新世界的觉悟已经达到这种程度，武力已不能再驾凌于理智和正义之上；而且正是由于这个缘故，反动势力已不再有可能像殖民统治者在往日的时代那样为所欲为地欺骗人了。
    我们知道你们目前对非洲的解放运动所作出的贡献意味着什么。我们也可以向你们说：目前在非洲进行的斗争，对亚洲、拉丁美洲以及对欧洲的被剥削阶层，有着同样有利的影响，而你们所进行的斗争则对非洲的生活产生了有利的影响。
    因此，我们之间相互依存是一个事实，而这个事实是我们大家所理解的。我们在访问贵国时，所以要向你们表示我们的合作意愿，所以要表示我们争取加强我们的友谊的基础，恰恰就是因为我们知道，没有贵国人民和我国人民之间的合作和谅解，没有这种一致行动，帝国主义仍然可能成为对我们每一方的危险的威胁。因此，最后打倒帝国主义的唯一的办法、缔造繁荣与和平的时代的唯一的办法，就是所有被剥削的人民，所有已解放或未解放的一切无产国家，勇敢地采取一致行动，来制止带来人类灾祸的反动逆流。
    这个联系着我们的因素，我们是认识到的；我们必须发展我们的一致行动。我们很高兴，两国之间的各项协定的签订，在中国人民和政府同几内亚人民和政府之间创造了新的力量。我们已经说过，几内亚方面将忠诚而坚定地竭尽全力，来使经济和文化协议不仅保持下去，而且得到尽可能迅速的发展。
    我们很高兴在上海这个城市看到非洲劳动世界的使者，遇见工人阶级的有资格的代表以及参加了在科纳克里举行的重大会议的教师们，参加这个会议的有教师的国际运动的代表们。我们确信，他们以我们这些国家的人民的名义已经或将要转达给你们的问候，将正是我们代表团所要转达的问候，因为我们存在着同样的意愿。
    有些非洲国家的人们所以迄今还没有同中华人民共和国建立外交关系，或者还没有具体地向你们的革命表示钦佩和信任，这只是因为殖民统治阻止了他们。但是你们可以确信，非洲的自由将使它能表示出自己的真正意愿。
    您刚才说过，帝国主义者把你们和我们看作无能之人；他们曾经是对的，我们曾经是无能的。一个国家的人民的才能是同他们对自己的国家所担负的责任成正比例的；但是各国人民一经恢复了自由，他们就表现出他们的才能超过帝国主义者。帝国主义者的“才能”在于杀人、在于破坏文化与经济发展。而解放了的各国人民和民主力量的才能，是创造生活，发展生活，建立友谊，缔造和平，巩固和平，以使人类能在尊严和繁荣中生活。
    在向你们转达问候的同时，我们要高呼：
    中国人民和非洲人民之间的永恒的欣欣向荣的友谊和信任万岁！
    各国人民、世界各国在平等和友爱合作中的和平万岁！
