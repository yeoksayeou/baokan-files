Xinhua News Agency, Urumqi, September 28th: The Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, carrying forward the glorious tradition of Nanniwan, with officers and soldiers united, working hard, has transformed over 11 million mu of primitive wilderness in the north and south of the Tianshan Mountains into fertile land with crisscrossing canals. They have established 189 large-scale mechanized farms and ranches, built a total of more than 30,000 kilometers of canals of various sizes, and made significant contributions to Xinjiang's socialist construction.

Since the People's Liberation Army entered Xinjiang at the end of 1949, in order to build the frontier of the motherland, under the leadership of General Wang Zhen, who had led the 359th Brigade of the Eighth Route Army in the great production movement in Nanniwan, northern Shaanxi, they quickly went to the north and south of the Tianshan Mountains to engage in reclamation and production. In the beginning, there were no tractors. The officers and soldiers, each with a "kantuman" (a type of hoe), worked diligently, cutting through thorns and brambles and sleeping in the open. Over the past decade, the 189 mechanized farms and ranches they have established have produced large quantities of grain, cotton, animal products, and rural sideline processed products for the country.

At the end of 1949, when the troops entered the Tarim Basin, it was still a desolate Gobi desert. The sandstorms blowing from the vast desert often swept away tents. The soldiers made a bold oath at the time: inherit the glorious tradition of Nanniwan and transform the desert into an oasis. They used the pickaxes and shovels they had used to dig trenches in the past, working tirelessly in winter and summer. When there were not enough tools, all officers and soldiers took out their allowances to buy "kantuman". When there were not enough livestock, they used manpower to pull plows. After several years of hard work, they not only achieved self-sufficiency in production but also accumulated a large amount of capital. In 1958, in the high tide of the Great Leap Forward across the country, this unit marched into both banks of the Tarim River and reclaimed more than 2 million mu of fertile land in the ancient wilderness. Where red willows and camel thorns once grew, various grain crops and cotton are now growing. The Manas reclamation area used to be a vast reed lake with no traces of human habitation. After the production troops entered here, they built reed sheds in the reed bushes flattened by wild boars, and used "kantuman" and bayonets to level hundreds of thousands of mu of reeds, diverting water from the Tianshan Mountains to grow crops. Over the past decade, they have built nine large reservoirs and fifteen canals on both banks of the Manas River, turning more than 4 million mu of wilderness in the western part of the Junggar Basin into an important grain and cotton producing area in Xinjiang. This year is the third year of continuous leap forward for the Production and Construction Corps. Holding high the banner of Nanniwan, they have built grass sheds in more remote areas such as the hinterland of the Tarim Basin, the Altai Mountains, and the Ili grasslands, and have reclaimed more than 3 million mu of wasteland in the first half of the year alone.

Like in Nanniwan, the vast number of cadres of the Production and Construction Corps are completely integrated with the soldiers, eating, living, working, and discussing together. Liu Kesang, a Red Army veteran who participated in the 25,000-li Long March and the director of the Chabuchar Management Office in the Ili reclamation area, is known as the "pioneer of road opening." Since 1950, he has been on the front line of reclamation, traversing thousands of miles of the Ili grassland with the soldiers and personally building five large farms. Every time a new farm is built, he takes the lead in hard work from breaking ground and digging red willows to planning the fields. After the farm is built, he leads the reclamation team, carrying luggage, to reclaim new farms. Xiao Fengrui, the political commissar of the Mosowan Management Office in the Shihezi reclamation area, who had participated in the Nanniwan great production movement, in order to develop the hinterland of Junggar, in the winter of 1957, took several exploration personnel with two water buckets and a kitchen knife and entered the Mosowan wilderness, more than 200 li away from the reclamation area. At that time, there was no water to drink within 200 li. They piled up snow, used one water bucket for watering and one water bucket for cooking, and dug wild onions with kitchen knives to eat as vegetables, persisting for more than a month. Today, 840,000 mu of cultivated land has been reclaimed here, and six mechanized farms have been built.

Under the leading influence of the old soldiers, the vast number of cadres and soldiers all regard hardship as glory and devote themselves to building the new socialist countryside in Xinjiang. In 1958, thousands of outstanding members of the Communist Youth League and young activists in the corps' reclamation areas carried their tools and went deep into various remote areas in the north and south of the Tianshan Mountains to reclaim wasteland. In one year, they reclaimed 400,000 mu of wasteland and built six Communist Youth League farms and one horticultural farm, producing more than 19 million jin of grain for the country last year alone. Wang Huanlan, a pig-raising expert in the corps, was a junior high school graduate five years ago. Because of her love for the frontier construction cause and inspired by the exemplary actions of the old soldiers, she applied three times to the most difficult livestock team to raise pigs. After becoming a breeder, this young girl humbly learned pig-raising techniques from Yang Wanyu, a model of the corps, and painstakingly studied, creating advanced experience in achieving full pregnancy in breeding. In 1958, she raised 40 boars alone (equal to three times the corps' quota), and the conception rate reached 100%. Tractor driver Hou Zhengyuan had never even seen a tractor before. After several years of hard study, he has now become a nationally renowned tractor driver. The locomotive he drives has been running safely for more than 19,000 hours without major repairs in the past four years, completing 23 and a half years of workload. The Manas River basin, a famous cotton-producing area, has historically been regarded as a forbidden zone for cotton planting due to the short frost-free period. The soldiers continued to experiment and painstakingly explore, taking a series of measures such as controlling watering and applying fertilizers in proportion, creating a set of advanced methods to promote early maturity of cotton from sowing to management, and opened up the northernmost cotton planting area in my country at about 43 degrees north latitude, and in 1953 and 1955, created a large-scale high-yield record of 20,000 mu and 80,000 mu with an average yield of 403 jin and 316 jin of seed cotton, respectively, of which Liu Xuefo, Xue Zhanchun, Yu Aihua, and Tan Xiufeng have successively become nationally known cotton-planting experts.

    解放军新疆生产建设兵团发扬南泥湾光荣传统
　　官兵一体艰苦奋斗建设新疆农村
    新华社乌鲁木齐28日电　中国人民解放军新疆生产建设兵团发扬南泥湾的光荣传统，官兵一体，艰苦奋斗，把天山南北一千一百多万亩原始荒原开垦为渠道纵横的良田，建立起一百八十九个大型的机械化农场和牧场，修成大小渠道总长三万多公里，为新疆社会主义建设事业作出了重大的贡献。
    人民解放军自1949年底进驻新疆后，为了建设祖国的边疆，在曾经在陕北南泥湾领导八路军三五九旅进行大生产运动的王震将军领导下，很快就开赴天山南北，从事垦荒生产。开始没有拖拉机，官兵们每人一把坎土镘，披荆斩棘，露宿风餐地勤奋苦干。十年多来，他们建立的一百八十九个机械化农场和牧场，为国家生产出了大量的粮食、棉花、畜产品和农村副业加工产品。
    1949年底当部队进入塔里木盆地时，那里还是一片荒无人烟的戈壁滩，从大沙漠吹来的风沙常常把帐篷卷走，战士们当时发出豪迈的誓言：继承南泥湾的光荣传统，变沙漠为绿洲。他们用过去掘战壕的十字镐和圆锹，不分冬夏，坚持施工。工具不足，全体官兵把自己的津贴费拿出来买坎土镘，牲畜不够，用人来拉犁，苦干了几年，不仅实现了生产自给，还积累了大量资金。1958年在全国大跃进高潮中，这支部队又开进塔里木河两岸，在万古荒原上开出二百多万亩良田。不久前还长着红柳和骆驼刺的地方，现在生长着各种粮食作物和棉花。玛纳斯垦区过去是荒绝人迹的大苇湖，生产部队进入这里之后，在野猪踩平的苇丛里搭起苇棚，用坎土镘和刺刀把数十万亩芦苇铲平，引天山水种庄稼。十年来，他们已经在玛纳斯河两岸修起九座大水库和十五条渠道，使准噶尔盆地西部的四百多万亩荒原变成了新疆的重要粮棉产地。今年是生产建设兵团持续跃进的第三年，他们高举南泥湾的大旗，又在塔里木盆地腹地，阿尔泰山区和伊犁草原等更为偏僻的地区，搭起草棚，上半年就开出三百多万亩荒地。
    像在南泥湾一样，生产建设兵团广大干部完全和战士打成一片，同吃、同住、同劳动、同商量。经过二万五千里长征的红军老战士、伊犁垦区察布查尔管理处处长刘可桑，被人称作“开路先锋”。他从1950年起就一直在开荒前线，和战士们一道踏遍了数千里的伊犁草原，亲手建成五个大农场。每建一个新农场，他从破土挖红柳到规划田园都带头苦干。农场建成以后，他又带着垦荒队，背起行李，去开垦新的农场。曾经参加过南泥湾大生产运动的石河子垦区莫索湾管理处政委萧凤瑞，为了开发准噶尔腹地，在1957年冬天，同几个勘探人员带着两个水桶和一把菜刀，进到远离垦区二百多里的莫索湾荒原上。当时二百里远近找不到水喝，他们就堆起积雪，一个水桶浇水，一个水桶作饭，用菜刀挖野葱当菜吃，坚持了一个多月。今天这里已经开垦出八十四万亩耕地，建成六个机械化农场。
    在老战士们的带头影响下，广大干部和战士都以艰苦为光荣，奋不顾身地建设新疆农村。1958年，兵团各垦区的成千上万名优秀共青团员和青年积极分子，携带着工具深入到天山南北各边远地区开荒，一年中就开出四十万亩荒地，兴建起六个共青团农场和一个园艺场，仅去年一年就为国家生产出一千九百多万斤粮食。兵团养猪能手王焕兰，五年前还是一个初中毕业生。由于她热爱边疆建设事业和在老战士模范行动的鼓舞下，三次申请到最艰苦的养畜队养猪。这个年轻姑娘当了饲养员以后，虚心向兵团模范杨万余学习养猪技术，苦心钻研，创造出配种全怀的先进经验。1958年她一个人饲养四十口公猪（等于兵团定额的三倍），配种受胎率达到100％。拖拉机手侯正元，过去连拖拉机都没见过，经过几年的苦学，现在成了全国著名的拖拉机手。他驾驶的机车，四年多来已经安全运行一万九千多小时无大修，完成了二十三年半的工作量。著名棉产区玛纳斯河流域，在历史上曾因无霜期短被视为植棉禁地，战士们不断试验和苦心摸索，采取控制浇水和按比例施肥等一系列措施，创造了从播种到管理的一套促使棉花早熟的先进办法，在北纬四十三度左右的地方开辟了我国最北部植棉区，并在1953年和1955年，创造出两万亩和八万亩平均单产四百零三斤和三百一十六斤籽棉的大面积丰产纪录，其中刘学佛、薛占春、于爱花和谭秀凤等先后成为全国知名的植棉能手。（附图片）
