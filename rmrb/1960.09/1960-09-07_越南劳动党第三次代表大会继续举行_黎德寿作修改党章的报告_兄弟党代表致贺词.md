　　At the meetings held this morning and afternoon, Comrade Le Duc Tho, member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Vietnam Workers' Party and Minister of the Central Organization Department, delivered a report on the revision of the Party Constitution on behalf of the Central Committee of the Vietnam Workers' Party.

　　Representatives of some fraternal parties who were invited to attend the congress delivered congratulatory speeches and read out congratulatory messages at the meetings this morning and afternoon. These representatives of fraternal parties were: François Billoux, head of the delegation of the French Communist Party; Bejko Baluku, head of the delegation of the Albanian Party of Labour; D. Dimov, head of the delegation of the Bulgarian Communist Party; Söldi István, head of the delegation of the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party; Pak Chong-ae, head of the delegation of the Korean Workers' Party; Genden, head of the delegation of the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party; Zenon Nowak, head of the delegation of the Polish United Workers' Party; Nicolae Ceaușescu, head of the delegation of the Romanian Workers' Party; Kurt Hager, head of the delegation of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany; Alexander Dubček, head of the delegation of the Czechoslovak Communist Party; Damodaran, head of the delegation of the Communist Party of India; Anwar Kadir, head of the delegation of the Communist Party of Indonesia; Tetsu Korehara, head of the delegation of the Japanese Communist Party; Bert Whyte of the Communist Party of Canada; and Luciano of the Italian Communist Party. Ali Yata, Secretary-General of the Moroccan Communist Party, who arrived in Hanoi today, also delivered a congratulatory speech at the meeting.

　　In his report on the revision of the Party Constitution, Le Duc Tho said that more than nine years have passed since the Second National Congress of the Party. During this period, the political and social situation in Vietnam has undergone fundamental changes.

　　He said: The current revolutionary situation and tasks have placed new and higher demands on party building.

　　He said: "The revision of the Party Constitution does not mean revising the basic principles of Marxist-Leninist party building. These principles have not been revised in the slightest. However, under the new circumstances and through the experience that has been gained, we must strive further in the work of building the party to implement these principles, thereby putting forward some specific and flexible regulations in accordance with these principles to suit the current needs."

　　Le Duc Tho emphasized: "According to the situation of our Party and the requirements of the revolutionary tasks, at present, more than ever, we must recognize and further strive to enhance the class character and vanguard nature of our Party."

　　He pointed out: "Strengthening the class character and vanguard nature of the Party requires, first of all, that in ideological work, we must pay special attention to establishing and consolidating the working-class stand among party members and cadres, improving the theoretical level of Marxism-Leninism, and carrying out an irreconcilable struggle against non-proletarian ideological tendencies." He said: "Now, our cadres and party members cannot only be satisfied with the anti-imperialist and anti-feudal stand, but should also have a high degree of socialist consciousness, and in the new revolutionary struggle, draw a clear line between the enemy and ourselves, between socialism and capitalism, between labor and exploitation, and between collectivism and individualism. The current revolutionary tasks are urgently requiring our Party to fully arm itself with the Marxist-Leninist theory of the universal laws of socialist revolution and socialist construction, and also require cadres and party members to rapidly improve their cultural and technical level. It is clear that the old experience and knowledge that our Party has accumulated in the stage of national people's democratic revolution is not enough. Only by improving all aspects of our level, especially the ideological and theoretical level, can our Party fully assume the role of vanguard and successfully complete its major historical mission."

　　He said: "Strengthening the class character and vanguard nature of the Party also requires that in terms of organization, we must pay attention to raising the standards for party members, removing some bad elements and those who are too poor in quality from the party, and recruiting outstanding advanced elements from workers, agricultural cooperative members, and revolutionary intellectuals into the party. We must pay attention to changing the social composition of party members, and first of all, we must attach importance to strengthening the worker component, and at the same time, due to the characteristics of our society, we must also attach importance to strengthening the poor peasant component within the party."

　　Le Duc Tho said: "In the general program of the Party Constitution, it is once again affirmed that 'the Vietnam Workers' Party takes Marxism-Leninism as the ideological basis of the Party and the guide to all actions,' emphasizing the need to creatively study and apply Marxism-Leninism to the specific practice of Vietnam."

　　He said: "Generally speaking, although our Party has grasped the weapon of Marxist-Leninist theory, it has sometimes not been good at combining this theory with the revolutionary practice of Vietnam."

　　He said, "Building socialism is a new task, and our experience is still lacking. Therefore, learning from the experience of fraternal parties is very important and necessary. We must organize cadres to study the experience of the Soviet Union, China, and other fraternal countries well. At the same time, we must overcome dogmatism among leading cadres at all levels, which is manifested in mechanically learning and applying the experience of fraternal countries. Some cadres do not conduct a comprehensive study of these experiences, and do not proceed from the characteristics and specific conditions of our country, and often mechanically transplant these experiences to our country without any changes. Some cadres despise the experience of the masses, believing that our country's practice is poor. They only like to learn from foreign experience, but do not delve into the situation of their own country, and do not regularly go deep into grassroots organizations to study and summarize experience. Dogmatism restricts the creativity of the Party and the masses, and cannot bring into play the wisdom and experience of the entire Party." He said: "In addition, although the manifestation of revisionism is not widespread, it is not non-existent. Between 1956 and 1957, when revisionists were attacking the international communist movement, a part of revisionist elements, represented by 'humanistic and fine quality' elements, and reactionary elements of the bourgeoisie, took advantage of our Party's self-criticism of errors in land reform and organizational rectification to launch attacks on the Party's leadership from political, economic, and cultural aspects. Among these elements, there were also some party members, and some party members, because their stand was not firm and they were unable to distinguish right from wrong, were more or less influenced by them and became suspicious, and some even echoed them and attacked the Party's leading organs and the Party's line."

　　He said: "In order to make learning in-depth and practical, criticism and self-criticism must be carried out at the same time, to discover all erroneous political and ideological tendencies and to fight against them, and through such struggle, to further improve the Marxist-Leninist stand, thought, and method."

　　He said: "Rectification is precisely a way to combine study with criticism and self-criticism. The experience of the Chinese Communist Party and our Party has proven that this is good. Some comrades have not realized that the results of the rectification movement from 1952 to 1953 were basically good. They only see the shortcomings, and do not make a correct analysis of the reasons for these shortcomings, so they even think that the rectification method cannot be adopted again in the future. This is wrong. The influence of non-proletarian ideology is still quite serious within the Party, and in the case where the spirit of criticism and self-criticism is not high and not frequent, then it is necessary and beneficial to carry out rectification within a certain period in order to focus on criticizing those incorrect ideas and unhealthy tendencies that have caused a lot of obstacles to the revolutionary work."

　　He also said: "We have sent cadres to participate in various large-scale mass movements, such as 'land reform,' 'agricultural cooperativization,' 'improving enterprise management,' and 'transforming private capitalist industry and commerce,' etc., and initially organized cadres to participate in physical labor. The results have proven that this is the best and largest school for training cadres. In the future, we must continue to systematically send cadres to participate in various mass revolutionary movements. Participation in physical labor by cadres should be stipulated as a system, and a system should be established whereby cadres at all levels must spend a certain amount of time each year going to the grassroots to live and work. It is the most realistic way to consolidate the class stand and overcome bureaucracy, and at the same time, it is also a way to help cadres combine theory with practice."

　　Le Duc Tho then pointed out: We must "further strengthen collective leadership."

　　He also said: "We must further strengthen the centralized and unified leadership of the Party Central Committee throughout the country. In some tasks that fall within the scope of local areas, leadership is uniformly provided by party committees at all levels. Strive to overcome the situation of decentralization and bureaucratic centralization."

　　Le Duc Tho then talked about the issue of "implementing the Party's mass line." He said: "The revolution is the cause of the masses, and the entire revolutionary cause led by our Party is a widespread and continuous movement to mobilize the masses. The August Revolution, the long-term war of resistance, and land reform are all movements to mobilize the masses; without mobilizing the masses, there would be no real people's revolution."

　　He said: "At present, in the cause of socialist construction, some comrades emphasize the role of science and technology, which is correct, but they therefore despise the role of the masses, and erroneously separate or oppose these two aspects. Science and technology are summarized from the experience of the masses' production labor and social struggle, and ultimately they are created by the masses. Science and technology must serve the practice of the people's production and struggle, so as to enable it to obtain continuous development. Therefore, we attach great importance to science and technology, but it must be based on fully bringing into play the revolutionary enthusiasm of the masses, and we must closely combine the two aspects of mobilizing the masses and developing science and technology." He said: "Only through the conscious activities of hundreds of millions of working people can socialism be successfully realized."

　　He said: "In order to implement the Party's mass line, we must take a series of ideological and organizational measures in a practical manner in the future. We must strengthen the education of the mass line among the masses, and strictly criticize all tendencies that deviate from the Party's mass line. We must improve our working methods and leadership style. It is necessary to make it normal for leading cadres to go to the grassroots and make it a system. Investigations and studies must be conducted for every task (at least for those important tasks). There must be individual guidance and pilot projects so that the leadership can absorb experience; on-site meetings should be held to directly summarize and learn from the experience of the masses."

　　He said: "We must strengthen the connection between party and state organs and the masses. Streamline organizational structures, expand democratic life, and adopt all appropriate forms to make it easy for the masses to approach and reflect the situation, express opinions, supervise and boldly criticize cadres and organs. Give full play to the role of people's congresses at all levels and workers' congresses in enterprises. We must strengthen the Party's inspection and supervision of cadres and state organs, strictly abide by discipline, and give appropriate punishment to bureaucratic elements who have caused serious losses to the Party and the state. We must pay attention to giving full play to the role of various mass organizations so that these organizations can truly become places where the masses gather and reflect opinions to the Party and state organs."

　　Le Duc Tho said: "The Party must be a united and unified whole in thought, politics, and organization. This is the life of the Party. This is the foundation for uniting the class, uniting the people, and defeating the enemy."

　　He said: "Unity and unification do not deny struggle. On the contrary, we must constantly struggle and resolve contradictions in order to achieve an increasingly high degree of unity and unification. We must fight against erroneous political and ideological tendencies in order to maintain unity within the Party and consolidate discipline within the Party. However, when it comes to the struggle within the Party, some comrades express timidity. They are afraid that doing so will break the unity. Therefore, for conflicting views, there is often no thorough debate to distinguish right from wrong; some shortcomings in the work often cannot be put forward with frank and strict criticism; in many party committees and party organizations, there is an atmosphere of 'harmony is precious.' This is a formal and false unity and unification because it is only based on individualistic relationships, not on Marxist-Leninist thought and the Party's line and policies as a starting point. This is a petty-bourgeois liberal tendency, and we must resolutely overcome it."

　　He said: "The form of the Party's ideological struggle is criticism and self-criticism. We must draw a line between the way of fighting class enemies in society and the way of fighting within the Party. Except for a few counter-revolutionary elements and speculators, the Party must resolutely expose them and expel them from its own ranks. As for those comrades who make mistakes unconsciously, as long as they accept the truth and work hard to correct their mistakes at any time, we must criticize them in the spirit of educating and uniting comrades and treat them with the attitude of treating illnesses and saving people."

　　Le Duc Tho said: "The leading role of the Party is the decisive factor for all victories of the revolution. This has been clearly proven in the history of the Vietnamese people's thirty years of revolutionary struggle. The current difficult and complex revolutionary tasks require further consolidation of the Party's leading role."

　　He said: "The Party is the highest organizational form of the working class and the main tool of the dictatorship of the proletariat. This is one of the basic principles in Lenin's theory of party building. In the environment where our Party leads the regime, especially during the period of the dictatorship of the proletariat, recognizing and mastering this principle and clearly understanding and correctly resolving the Party's leading relationship with other organizations in the system of the dictatorship of the proletariat is of great significance."

　　He said: "Entering a new stage of the revolution, the development of our work in all aspects is very broad and complex. The cause of socialist construction requires the Party to have comprehensive leadership, and first of all, we must strive to deeply study the leadership over the economy and culture."

　　He said: "While strengthening ideological leadership and political leadership, the Party must attach importance to organizational leadership."

　　Le Duc Tho then elaborated on some specific issues in the Party Constitution in detail.

    越南劳动党第三次代表大会继续举行
    黎德寿作修改党章的报告　兄弟党代表致贺词
    新华社河内6日电　越南劳动党第三次全国代表大会今天继续举行会议。
    在今天上午和下午的会议上，越南劳动党中央政治局委员、中央组织部长黎德寿同志代表越南劳动党中央委员会作了修改党章的报告。
    应邀前来参加大会的一些兄弟党代表在今天上午和下午的会上先后致了贺词和宣读了贺电。这些兄弟党的代表是：法国共产党代表团团长弗朗索瓦·皮佑、阿尔巴尼亚劳动党代表团团长贝·巴卢库、保加利亚共产党代表团团长迪·迪莫夫、匈牙利社会主义工人党代表团团长苏尔迪·伊斯特万、朝鲜劳动党代表团团长朴正爱、蒙古人民革命党代表团团长根登、波兰统一工人党代表团团长泽农·诺瓦格、罗马尼亚工人党代表团团长尼古拉·吉奥逊、德国统一社会党代表团团长库尔特·哈格、捷克斯洛伐克共产党代表团团长亚历山大·杜布切克、印度共产党代表团团长达莫达蓝、印度尼西亚共产党代表团团长安瓦尔·卡迪尔、日本共产党代表团团长藏原惟人、加拿大共产党代表伯特·怀特和意大利共产党代表卢契安诺。今天抵达河内的摩洛哥共产党总书记阿里·亚塔也在会议上致了贺词。
    黎德寿在他所作的关于修改党的章程的报告中说，从党的第二次代表大会到现在已经九年多了。在这个期间，越南的政治和社会形势已经起了根本的变化。
    他说：目前的革命形势和任务已给建党工作提出新的、更高的要求。
    他说：“党章的修改，这并不是说把马克思列宁主义建党的基本原则修改掉，这些原则是从没有丝毫修改的。但是在新的情况下，并通过那些已经取得的经验，我们必须在建设党的工作中更进一步为贯彻这些原则而奋斗，从而按照这些原则提出一些具体、灵活的规定，使它适合现时的需要。”
    黎德寿强调说：“根据我们党的情况，根据革命任务的要求，目前，我们比任何时候都更必须认清并进一步为增强我们党的阶级性和先锋性而奋斗。”
    他指出：“加强党的阶级性和先锋性，首先是要求在思想工作方面必须特别注重在党员、干部中确立和巩固工人阶级的立场，提高马克思列宁主义的理论水平、与非无产阶级思想倾向作不调和的斗争。”他说：“现在，我们的干部、党员不能只满足于反帝、反封建的立场，而还应该有高度的社会主义觉悟，在新的革命斗争中，划清敌我之间、社会主义与资本主义之间、劳动与剥削之间、集体主义与个人主义之间的界线。当前的革命任务正迫切要求我们党必须以马克思列宁主义关于社会主义革命和社会主义建设的普遍规律的理论来充分地武装自己，同时也要求干部、党员必须迅速提高文化和技术水平。很清楚，我们党在民族人民民主革命阶段中已积累下来的老经验和知识是不够了。只有提高各方面的水平，首先是思想和理论水平，我们党才能完满地担负起先锋部队的作用，才能胜利地完成自己重大的历史使命。”
    他说：“在加强党的阶级性和先锋性的同时还要求在组织方面必须注意提高党员标准，清除一些坏分子和太差的党员出党，并接收在工人、农业合作社社员和革命知识分子中优秀的先进分子入党。我们必须注意改变党员的社会成份，首先要重视加强工人成份，同时由于我国社会的特点，也必须重视加强党内的贫农成份。”
    黎德寿说：“党章的总纲中，再一次肯定‘越南劳动党是以马克思列宁主义作为党的思想基础和一切行动的指南的’，强调指出要创造性地学习并运用马克思列宁主义于越南的具体实践中。”
    他说：“我们党总的来说，虽然已掌握了马克思列宁主义理论的武器，但有的时候还没有善于把这个理论和越南革命实践结合起来。”
    他说，“建设社会主义是一件新的工作，我们的经验还缺乏，因此，学习兄弟党的经验是非常重要和必要的。我们必须，和好好地组织干部学习苏联、中国和其他兄弟国家的经验。同时，我们必须克服各级领导干部中的教条主义，它表现在机械地学习和搬用兄弟国家的经验。有些干部不对这些经验作全面研究，不从我国的特点和具体情况出发，往往机械地把这些经验原封不动地搬到我国来。有些干部轻视群众的经验，认为我国的实践贫乏，他们只喜欢向外学习经验，而不深入研究本国的情况，不经常深入基层组织学习和总结经验。教条主义限制了党和群众的创造力，不能发挥全党的智慧和经验。”他说：“此外，修正主义的表现虽然不普遍，但并不是没有的。1956年到1957年间，修正主义者正向国际共产主义运动进攻的时候，以‘人文、佳品’分子为代表的一部分修正主义分子和资产阶级的反动分子，就趁我们党对土地改革和整顿组织中的错误而进行自我批评的时候，便从政治、经济、文化等方面向党的领导展开进攻。这些分子之中也有若干党员、有一部分党员因立场不坚定，不能够辨别是非，或多或少都受了它们的影响而发生怀疑，甚至有些还附和他们，攻击党的各领导机关和党的路线。”
    他说：“为了使学习深入和切实，必须同时进行批评和自我批评，要发现一切错误的政治、思想倾向并向它作斗争，通过这样的斗争而进一步提高马克思列宁主义的立场、思想和方法。”
    他说：“整训正是学习与批评和自我批评相结合的方式，中国共产党和我们党的经验证明这是好的，有一些同志没有认识到1952到1953年的整训运动结果基本上是好的，他们只看到缺点，而对这些缺点的原因又不作正确的分析，所以甚至认为今后再不能采用整训的办法了。这是不对的。在党内还存在相当严重的非无产阶级思想影响，在批评和自我批评的精神还不高而又不经常的情况下，那么，在一定时期内进行整训，以便集中批判那些给革命工作造成不少阻碍的不正确的思想和歪风是必要和有利的。”
    他还说：“我们曾经派干部去参加各次广大的群众运动，如‘土地改革’、‘农业合作化’、‘改进企业管理’、‘改造私营资本主义工商业’等，并初步组织干部参加体力劳动。结果证明：这是锻炼干部最良好的广大的学校。今后，我们还要有计划地继续使干部去参加各项群众革命运动。对干部参加体力劳动应当规定成为一种制度，应当订出各级干部每年有一定的时间必须下基层去生活和工作的制度。它是巩固阶级立场、克服官僚主义的一个最现实的办法，同时这也是帮助干部把理论和实践互相结合起来的办法。”
    黎德寿接着指出：必须“进一步加强集体领导。”
    他还说：“必须更加加强党中央在全国范围内的集中统一领导。在属于地方范围的一些工作，统一由各级党委领导。努力克服分散和官僚式的集中情况。”
    黎德寿接着谈到“贯彻党的群众路线”的问题。他说：“革命是群众的事业，我们党所领导的全部革命事业正是一个广泛而持续的发动群众的运动。八月革命，长期抗战，土地改革等都是发动群众的运动；没有发动群众就没有任何真正的人民革命。”
    他说：“目前，在社会主义建设的事业中，有的同志强调科学技术的作用，这是正确的，但是他们却因此而轻视群众的作用，并把这两方面错误地分割开来或者对立起来。科学技术是从群众的生产劳动和社会斗争的经验中总结出来的，而且归根到底它是由群众创造出来的。科学技术必须为人民群众的生产和斗争的实践服务，从而使之获得不断的发展。因此我们十分重视科学和技术，但它必须以充分地发挥群众的革命热情为基础，并且要把发动群众和发展科学技术两个方面紧密地结合起来。”他说：“只有通过千百万劳动人民的自觉的活动，社会主义才能胜利地实现。”
    他说：“为了贯彻党的群众路线，今后我们必须切实地采取一系列的思想和组织方面的措施。必须在群众中加强群众路线的教育，严格地批判脱离党的群众路线的一切倾向。必须改进工作方法和领导作风。要使领导干部到基层去成为正常化并使之成为一种制度，每一项工作（至少是对那些重要的工作）都必须进行调查研究，既有个别指导，又搞试点，使领导方面能吸收经验；召开现场会议，以便直接总结和学习群众的经验。”
    他说：“必须加强党和国家机关和群众之间联系。精简组织机构，扩大民主生活和采用一切适当的形式使群众容易接近和反映情况，发表意见，监督和大胆批评干部和机关。发挥各级人民议会和企业中的职工大会的作用。必须加强党对干部和国家机关的检查和监督，严格地遵守纪律，对那些给党和国家造成严重的损失的官僚主义分子加以适当的处分。必须注意发挥各个群众组织的作用，使这些组织真正地成为群众给党和国家机关汇集和反映意见的地方。”
    黎德寿说：“党在思想、政治和组织上必须是团结和统一的一个整体。这是党的生命。这是统一阶级、团结人民、打倒敌人的基础。”
    他说：“团结和统一并不是否认斗争，相反的必须经常斗争、解决矛盾，才能达到日益高度的团结和统一。必须对错误的政治思想倾向作斗争，才能维护党内的统一和巩固党内的纪律。但是，在谈到党内斗争时，有些同志表示畏怯，他们恐怕这样作会使团结破裂，因此对相抵触的观点，经常没有进行彻底的辩论，以便分清是非黑白；在工作中的一些缺点，经常不能提出坦率的严格的批判；在很多党委和党的组织中存在着‘一团和气，以和为贵’的气氛。这是形式的、虚伪的团结和统一，因为它只是建立在个人主义的关系上，而不是以马克思列宁主义的思想和党的路线、政策作为出发点的。这是小资产阶级自由主义的倾向，我们必须坚决地克服它。”
    他说：“党思想斗争的形式，是批评与自我批评，我们必须划清在社会上反对阶级敌人的斗争方式与党内的斗争方式。除了少数反革命分子和投机分子，党必须坚决地揭露和将他们驱逐出自己的队伍外，对那些无意识地犯错误的同志，只要他们随时随地接受真理和努力改过，我们就必须本着教育和团结同志的精神，采取治病救人的方针和对待同志的态度来对他们进行批评。”
    黎德寿说：“党的领导作用是革命一切胜利的决定因素，这点在我国人民的三十年来革命斗争历史中已清楚的得到证明了。目前困难的、复杂的革命任务，要求更进一步去巩固党的领导作用。”
    他说：“党是工人阶级的最高组织形式，是无产阶级专政的主要工具，这是列宁建党学说中的基本原理之一。在我们党领导政权的环境中，特别是在无产阶级专政时期中，对认清和掌握这个原理，对清楚地认识和正确解决党对无产阶级专政系统中的其他组织的领导关系，是有着极重大的意义的。”
    他说：“进入革命新阶段，我们各方面工作的发展都是很广大的、复杂的。社会主义建设事业要求党应有全面的领导，首先必须努力深入学习对经济和文化的领导。”
    他说：“在加强思想领导和政治领导的同时，党必须重视对组织方面的领导。”
    黎德寿随后还详细阐述了党章中的一些具体问题。
