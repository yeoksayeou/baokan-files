　　A New Nitrogen Fertilizer Factory

　　In Bulgaria, near the "Maritsa-East" coal mining area, a new nitrogen fertilizer factory is under construction. The construction site is a scene of intense labor: bulldozers and excavators are roaring, and trucks loaded with bricks, cement, steel bars, and wood are constantly arriving...

　　All engineering tasks are urgent. But it seems that the prefabrication component production center is the most tense at present, because all workshops and factory buildings need this type of component.

　　Trindafilov, a two-time winner of the National Medal, leads the prefabrication component work team. For seven years, this work team has performed outstandingly on many construction sites across the country. Now, the Trindafilov-led work team is responsible for producing all the columns for the nitrogen fertilizer factory's workshops and warehouses, as well as the walls for the oxygen station, fire station, and garage. They produce fifteen to twenty cubic meters of prefabricated components every day. Originally, the target for the first quarter of this year was three hundred cubic meters, but they produced five hundred cubic meters.

　　As the project progresses, large numbers of young construction workers are pouring in from all over the country every day. They are responding to the call of the Communist Youth League to participate in the construction of the nitrogen fertilizer factory. When the factory is completed, these young people will enter the spacious and bright workshops and become the masters here.

　　Just a few months ago, this was a field. Now the frames of twenty factory buildings are beginning to take shape. By 1962, when the first phase of the factory is completed, the factory will produce 220,000 to 230,000 tons of fertilizer annually. By 1964, when the second phase of the project is completed, the annual production capacity will reach 400,000 tons.

　　This new nitrogen fertilizer factory is being built with Soviet assistance. It will be one of Bulgaria's largest enterprises, with a production output three times that of the Dimitrov Chemical Factory. It can be seen that in the near future, trains loaded with fertilizer will depart from here and be distributed to fields all over the country.

### 一座新的氮肥工厂

　　一座新的氮肥工厂
    在保加利亚，靠近“马里查—东”煤矿区的地方，一座新的氮肥工厂正在兴建中。建筑工地上，一片紧张的劳动景象：推土机和挖土机在轰鸣，满载着砖、水泥、钢筋和木材的大卡车不绝于途……。
    各项工程任务都很紧迫。可是看来，目前预制构件的生产中心是最紧张的了，因为所有车间和厂房都需要这类构件。
    两次获国家勋章的特林达菲洛夫领导着预制构件的工作队，七年来，这个工作队在全国很多建设工地上，任务一直完成得很出色。现在，特林达菲洛夫领导的工作队负责生产氮肥工厂所有车间、仓库的柱子，氧气站、消防站和车库的墙壁。他们每天生产十五—二十立方米的预制构件。本来按计划今年第一季度的指标是三百立方米，可是他们生产了五百立方米。
    随着工程的进展，每天从全国各地涌来大批青年建设者。他们响应共青团的召唤，来参加氮肥工厂的建设。当工厂落成以后，这些青年们就将走进宽敞明亮的车间，成为这里的主人了。
    仅仅几个月之前，这里还是一片田野。现在二十个厂房的架子已初具规模了。到工厂第一阶段工程完成的1962年，工厂每年将生产二十二、三万吨肥料。到第二阶段工程完工的1964年，每年的生产能力将达到四十万吨。
    这个新的氮肥工厂是在苏联帮助下建设的。它将是保加利亚最大的企业之一，产量将达季米特洛夫化学工厂的三倍。可以看到，在不久的将来，满载肥料的列车将从这里开出，分送到全国各地的田野上。
