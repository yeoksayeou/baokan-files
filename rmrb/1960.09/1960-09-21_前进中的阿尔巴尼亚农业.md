Advancing Albanian Agriculture

Vigorously Reclaiming Wasteland

　　In the four and a half years since the start of the Second Five-Year Plan, Albania has reclaimed a total of 73,860 hectares of virgin land. It is estimated that by the end of this year, the task of reclaiming 75,000 hectares of virgin land during the Second Five-Year Plan, as stipulated by the Third Congress of the Albanian Labor Party, will be greatly overfulfilled.
　　The work of reclaiming new wasteland is an important means for Albania to increase agricultural products and develop animal husbandry, and it began in the first few years after liberation. In 1959, Albania's arable land area increased to 435,291 hectares. The planting area of fruit trees, grapevines, and olive trees has also been greatly expanded.

　　Strengthening Agricultural Research
　　In order to strengthen agricultural research, Albania has established a "Michurin" Institute in Lushnjë District on the Muzekë Plain, and experimental stations responsible for research on tobacco planting and research on beet and grain planting have been established in Ulzë District of Tirana and in Maliq, respectively. This year, experimental stations for research on grape cultivation and citrus cultivation will continue to be established in various places.
　　In recent years, the "Michurin" Institute has carried out a series of experimental studies and put forward a number of suggestions with great practical value, which have promoted the increase in agricultural products.
　　In the past five years, the Institute has conducted comparative studies of nearly 100 kinds of domestic hybrid corn and corn imported from the Soviet Union and other countries. Through this research, it has been proved that hybrid corn is suitable for Albanian conditions.
　　The Institute has also conducted comparative studies on more than 30 kinds of beets, potatoes, and tobacco imported from socialist countries, and as a result, the best varieties have been selected. These superior varieties have been recommended for widespread sowing.
　　The Institute has also conducted important research on the use of chemical fertilizers for various crops and on the care of crops.

　　Extensively Developing Animal Husbandry
　　In recent years, Albanian agricultural cooperatives, in accordance with the task put forward by the Central Committee of the Albanian Labor Party to increase the production of meat and milk at a faster rate, are vigorously developing livestock and improving livestock breeds. Many cooperatives now have sites for raising cattle, sheep, pigs, and poultry. The number of livestock in agricultural cooperatives is constantly increasing. The growth of various livestock and poultry in the first six months of this year compared to the end of last year is as follows: cattle 7.2%, sheep 29.2%, goats 32%, sows 5.2%, poultry 48.2%.
　　Due to the increase in the number of livestock in agricultural cooperatives and throughout the country, it is expected that by 1965, the per capita production of meat and milk will double compared to 1957.

　　Improving Livestock Breeds
　　Many agricultural cooperatives in Albania are widely using purebred sheep and cattle for artificial insemination. This year, 90,000 ewes and more than 46,000 cows will be inseminated in this way, which means that 80% of the total number of livestock will be improved, and the percentage of births will be guaranteed to increase.
　　The state has provided enormous assistance in this regard. For three years, state-owned import enterprises have imported thousands of purebred ewes and rams from the Soviet Union and other socialist countries for state farms. The state has imported and distributed artificial insemination tools and has trained the necessary cadres in this area. As a result of these measures, the number of sheep bred in this way is much higher than expected. The results of this practice are very good, especially in terms of wool quality.

### 前进中的阿尔巴尼亚农业

　　前进中的阿尔巴尼亚农业
　　大力开垦荒地
　　在第二个五年计划开始后的四年半内，阿尔巴尼亚共开垦了七万三千八百六十公顷生荒地。据估计，到今年年底时，阿尔巴尼亚劳动党第三次代表大会规定的在第二个五年计划期间开垦七万五千公顷生荒地的任务，将大大超额完成。
    开垦新荒地的工作，是阿尔巴尼亚增加农产品和发展畜牧业的一项重要手段，它在解放之后头几年就开始了。在1959年，阿尔巴尼亚的耕地面积增加到了四十三万五千二百九十一公顷。果树、葡萄藤和橄榄树的种植面积也大大扩大。
    加强农业研究工作
    为了加强农业研究工作，阿尔巴尼亚在穆泽克平原上的卢什?区建立了一个“米丘林”研究所，在地拉那区的乌尔斯佩克和在马立克分别建立了负责研究烟草种植和研究甜菜、谷物种植的试验站。今年并将在各地继续建立研究葡萄栽培和柑桔栽培等试验站。
    近几年来，“米丘林”研究所进行了一系列的试验性研究，并且提出了一些有很大实用价值的建议，促进了农产品的增产。
    近五年来，研究所把近百种本国的杂交玉蜀黍和从苏联及其它国家进口的玉蜀黍作了比较性研究。通过这种研究，证明杂交玉蜀黍适于阿尔巴尼亚的条件。
    研究所对三十多种从社会主义国家进口的甜菜、马铃薯和烟草也作了比较性研究，结果选出了最优良的品种，这些优良品种已被推荐广泛播种。
    研究所还对各种作物使用化学肥料和对作物的护理等作了重要的研究。
      广泛发展畜牧业
    近年来，阿尔巴尼亚农业合作社根据阿尔巴尼亚劳动党中央委员会所提出的要以更快的速度增加肉类和牛奶的生产任务，正在大力发展牲畜和改良牲畜品种。许多合作社现在都有了饲养牛、羊、猪和家禽的场地。农业合作社的牲畜正在不断增加。今年头六个月各种牲畜和家禽比去年底增长的情况如下：牛7.2％，羊29.2％，山羊32％，母猪5.2％，家禽48.2％。
    由于农业合作社和全国各地牲畜头数的增加，预料到1965年，按人口平均计算的肉类和牛奶的生产将比1957年增长一倍。
        改良牲畜品种
    阿尔巴尼亚的许多农业合作社正在广泛用纯种的羊和牛进行人工配种。今年将有九万只母羊和四万六千多头母牛用这种方法配种，即将有占总数80％的牲畜改良品种，并保证产仔的百分比增加。
    国家在这方面提供了巨大的援助。三年来，国营进口企业为国营农场从苏联和其他社会主义国家进口了成千只纯种母羊和公羊。国家进口和分配了人工配种工具，并且已经在这方面训练了必需的干部。由于采取了这些措施，用这种方法来配种的羊的头数要比预料的多得多。这种做法的结果非常好，特别是在羊毛的质量方面。
