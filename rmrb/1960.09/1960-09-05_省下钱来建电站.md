    Saving Money to Build a Power Station

    Our commune only has a few offices and no dormitories for cadres. The sixty-odd commune cadres live in various production teams. Sometimes, after attending meetings in the commune, they have to return to their production teams overnight. To take care of the work and rest of the commune cadres, the county allocated 800 yuan to the commune to build dormitories.

    After the money was allocated, Xu Xing, the first secretary of the commune party committee, had a new plan. He thought: some houses need to be built, but not that much money is needed. As long as we adhere to the principle of being simple and crude, we can save some money to use in production. The commune cadres all said that Secretary Xu's idea was good. Everyone decided to work together, using the old sheds left over from the Great Leap Forward in steel production, to build twenty-six dormitories. The remaining money was used to build a fifteen-watt small power station. The commune office now has electric lights, and the commune-run industry has power.

    省下钱来建电站
    我们公社只有几间办公室，没有干部宿舍，六十多名公社干部分别住在各个生产队里；有时，回公社开会还要连夜回到生产队去。为了照顾公社干部的工作和休息，县里拨了八百元钱给公社建宿舍。
    拨下钱来以后，公社党委第一书记徐兴却有个新的打算，他想：需要建一些房子，但也用不了这么多的钱，只要本着因陋就简的原则，就可以节省下一部分钱用到生产中去。公社干部都说徐书记的主意好，大家决定人人动手，利用大办钢铁时留下来的旧棚子，盖了二十六间宿舍。剩下的钱，修建了一座十五瓦的小型电站，公社办公从此有了电灯，社办工业有了动力。河南巩县大峪沟公社  杜春林
