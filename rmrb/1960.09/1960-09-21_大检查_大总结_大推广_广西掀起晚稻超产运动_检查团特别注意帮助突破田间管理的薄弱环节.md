Great Inspection, Great Summation, Great Promotion
Guangxi Launches a Late Rice Super-Production Movement
Inspection Teams Pay Special Attention to Helping Break Through Weak Links in Field Management

    Nanning, September 19th (report from our newspaper) – Guangxi's rural areas are universally employing on-site field meetings and organizing mass inspections to rapidly propel the movement to seize bumper harvests of late rice, centered on field management, to a climax.
    The on-site meetings held throughout Guangxi are based on the main problems of field management in each locality, selecting advanced models, conducting field consultations, and then summarizing and promoting advanced experiences. The Baise Special Zone, through on-site field meetings attended by secretaries from the county, commune, and brigade levels, as well as representatives of commune members, summarized and promoted the experiences of Mubi and Jingxi counties in comprehensively caring for crops, including both paddy fields and dry land, and both staple grains and miscellaneous grains. After studying these experiences, various localities formulated new field management measures according to their specific situations: for middle rice that has not yet begun to form grains, continue to carry out weeding and topdressing; for rice that has begun to form grains, increase the application of "rice embryo fertilizer"; for rice that has already headed, carry out "five preventions" work, focusing on preventing lodging; late rice must be weeded three times and topdressed three times; late corn must be earthed up twice and topdressed twice; sweet potatoes with roots should be fertilized with ash to promote tuber growth, and those with leaves should be fertilized with liquid manure to promote root growth, while also doing a good job in weeding and pest control. Through this meeting, each county established ambitious goals, vowing to catch up with Mubi and Jingxi in field management. In order to improve work efficiency, the Wuzhou Special Zone held on-site meetings in Xindi Commune, Cangwu County, and Huangtian Commune, He County, where the use of weeding tools was relatively good. At the meetings, 54 different types of weeding tools from various counties were gathered for on-site use, evaluation, and appraisal, and five types of weeding tools with simple structures, easy operation, and good effects were selected for promotion throughout the special zone. Currently, a new upsurge of large-scale manufacturing, promotion, and use of weeding tools has been launched in this special zone.
    While holding on-site meetings or afterwards, various localities in Guangxi organized mass field inspections with the people's commune as the unit, with the participation of cadres, technicians, and experienced farmers, to promote various advanced experiences according to local conditions. For example, some communes in Heng County, through field inspections, discovered that some production teams and work groups had weak leadership and lacked effective measures for field management. Therefore, they learned from the experience of Ningming County in concentrating leadership forces to go deep into the front lines, immediately drew a group of cadres from the brigades and teams to strengthen the leadership of the production teams and work groups, and formulated practical measures to vigorously grasp field management. These communes also established ties with Xiashi and Munan communes in Ningming County to carry out competitions, determined to learn from the advanced and catch up with the advanced.
    In order to achieve balanced development in the care work between regions and between crops, the inspection teams in various places paid special attention to helping break through the weak links in field management. For example, the Donglan County inspection team went deep into inspecting the growth of miscellaneous grain crops. They found that many places did not pay attention to the care of miscellaneous grain crops, so the inspection team specifically helped analyze the reasons, calculate gains and losses, and urged the communes to quickly formulate measures, arrange labor, and launch a competition to "make dry land catch up with paddy fields and miscellaneous grains catch up with rice." Currently, more than half of the dry land crops in the county have undergone one to two topdressings and earthings, and the crops are growing vigorously. After the general inspection, Bobai County launched a heat wave of vigorously attacking low-yield fields while transferring to the second and third weeding and topdressing. The county dispatched a total of more than 5,600 commune and brigade cadres, party members, and league members to more than 3,000 low-yield depressions to serve as "depression chiefs," and more than 100,000 mu of low-yield fields were generally given one or two applications of fertilizer.

    大检查　大总结　大推广
　　广西掀起晚稻超产运动
　  检查团特别注意帮助突破田间管理的薄弱环节
    本报南宁19日电　广西农村普遍运用田间现场会议和组织群众性大检查的方法，把以田间管理为中心的、夺取晚造超包产运动迅速推向高潮。
    广西各地召开的现场会议，都是根据本地田间管理的主要问题，选择先进典型，进行田间会诊，然后总结推广先进经验。百色专区通过有县、公社、大队三级书记和社员代表参加的田间现场会议，总结、推广了睦边、靖西两县既抓水田又抓旱地、既抓主粮又抓杂粮等全面护理作物的经验。各地学习了这些经验，分别情况订立了新的田间管理措施：中稻尚未含胎的继续开展耘田追肥，含胎的要增泼禾胎肥，已抽穗的要开展以防倒伏为主的“五防”工作；晚稻一定要做到三耘三追肥；晚玉米要做到培土两次、追肥两次；红薯长根的要施草木灰攻薯，长叶的要施水粪攻根，同时做好除草除虫工作。通过这次会议，各县都树立雄心壮志，要在田间管理工作中赶上睦边和靖西。梧州专区为了提高工效，分别在推广使用耘田器较好的苍梧县新地公社和贺县黄田公社召开现场会议，会上集中了各县现有各式耘田器五十四种，进行田间使用评比鉴定，并评选出五种构造简单、使用轻便、效果良好的耘田器，在全专区推广。目前，这个专区已掀起了大制造、大推广、大使用耘田器的新高潮。
    在召开现场会议的同时或会后，广西各地都以人民公社为单位，组织了有干部、技术员和有经验的农民参加的群众性的田间大检查，因地制宜地推广各种先进经验。如横县的一些公社，通过田间大检查，发现有些生产队、作业组领导力量薄弱，田间管理缺乏有效措施，于是便学习宁明县集中领导力量深入第一线的经验，立即从大队和小队中抽出一批干部充实生产队和作业组的领导，并订出切实的措施，狠抓田间管理。这些公社还分别同宁明县的夏石、睦南等公社挂钩，开展了对手赛，决心学先进、赶先进。
    为了使地区与地区、作物与作物之间护理工作平衡发展，各地检查团特别注意帮助突破田间管理的薄弱环节。如东兰县检查团特别深入检查杂粮作物的生长情况，发现不少地方不重视杂粮作物的护理，检查团便具体帮助分析原因，算得失账，促使各公社迅速订措施，安排劳力，展开了“旱地赶水田、杂粮赶水稻”的竞赛运动。目前全县已有一半以上旱地作物经过了一至两次的追肥培土，作物生势旺盛。博白县在大检查之后，趁转入第二、三次耘田追肥时，掀起了猛攻低产田的热潮。全县派出了公社、大队干部，党团员共五千六百多人，到三千多条低产垌去当垌长，十万多亩低产田普遍增施了一、二次肥料。
