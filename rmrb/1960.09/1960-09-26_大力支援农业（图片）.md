    This is the mechanics of the machine tractor station cultivating for the Shijak Assu Friendship Agricultural Cooperative.
    In order to vigorously support agricultural production, outstanding cadres and experts from Czechoslovak scientific research departments and other institutions have gone to the countryside to help with work.
