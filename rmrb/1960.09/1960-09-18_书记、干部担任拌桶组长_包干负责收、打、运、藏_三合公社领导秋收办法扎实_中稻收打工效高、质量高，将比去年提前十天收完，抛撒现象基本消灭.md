Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, 17th: Party organization secretaries at all levels and over 90% of cadres in the Sanhe People's Commune of Jiangyou County, Sichuan Province, have gone deep into the front lines of the autumn harvest, serving as mixing barrel team leaders and using the mixing barrel team as the core, contracting to be responsible for all aspects of harvesting, threshing, transporting, and storing. This ensures that the current autumn harvest work is timely, meticulous, and well-organized. It is estimated that the entire harvest and threshing will be completed about ten days earlier than in previous years, and wasteful scattering will be basically eliminated.

The mixing barrel team is the most basic labor organization for the autumn harvest. One mixing barrel consists of five people: two cutting, two threshing, and one transporting. Secretaries and cadres going deep into the grassroots to serve as mixing barrel team leaders is a new leadership method for the autumn harvest proposed by the Sanhe Commune Party Committee based on the provincial Party committee's instructions on strengthening autumn harvest leadership and the current situation. This year, the situation in the entire commune is as follows: more than 80% of the labor force is concentrated on the front line; the varieties of mid-season rice are consistent, and the maturity period is relatively uniform; the tasks of autumn planting and autumn management are greater than last year. This situation requires leadership to keep up quickly and to be more specific and practical. Therefore, the commune decided that all five commune Party committee secretaries, twenty-four management area branch secretaries, and three hundred and twenty-three production team leaders and above would all go down to serve as mixing barrel team leaders during the autumn harvest, with "Secretary Barrel" and "Cadre Barrel" acting as the leadership core to ensure the smooth and comprehensive progress of the autumn harvest work with high efficiency and high quality.

After the secretaries and cadres served as mixing barrel team leaders, the quality of harvesting and threshing significantly improved, and the amount of wasteful scattering per mu decreased from 7%-8% of the yield to about 2%. Wang Hongjun, the first secretary of the Commune Party Committee, added enclosures, tops, and curtains to the mixing barrel on the first day he served as mixing barrel team leader, lifting, cutting, and placing lightly during harvesting, and placing the ears of grain neatly, spreading them out, and shaking them frequently during threshing. As a result, one mu of land yielded 572 jin, and no ears or grains of rice were visible in the field after threshing. At that time, a neighboring mixing barrel, because it did not take these measures, harvested and threshed one mu of land that was exactly the same as this mu, but only yielded 523 jin. That evening, the Commune Party Committee used this fact to conduct comparative education among the commune members. The commune members not only recognized the importance of careful threshing and harvesting, but also put forward more methods for careful threshing and harvesting.

After the secretaries and cadres served as mixing barrel team leaders, because they had a thorough understanding of the situation, they often flexibly allocated labor based on actual needs, so that harvesting, threshing, transporting, and storing were closely linked. Within a mixing barrel team, in general, harvesting is more stressful in the morning, so most people concentrate on harvesting; threshing is more stressful at noon, so most people concentrate on threshing; transporting and storing into warehouses is more stressful in the afternoon, so most people concentrate on transporting and storing; wherever it is most stressful, the secretaries and cadres go there to participate in labor and provide specific leadership. Groups and teams also frequently cooperate and support each other based on the actual situation, so that harvesting and threshing are done as each plot ripens. All the mid-season rice in the commune has been harvested in a timely manner.

After the secretaries and cadres served as mixing barrel team leaders, they also promptly discovered, summarized, and promoted various advanced experiences, which greatly promoted the progress of the entire commune's autumn harvest. The entire set of more than ten kinds of rapid harvesting and threshing methods currently used in the commune were all discovered and summarized by the secretaries and cadres during the joint harvesting and threshing with the commune members.

Secretaries and cadres serving as mixing barrel team leaders and working alongside commune members greatly encouraged the commune members' enthusiasm for labor. The masses said, "Cadres can go into the sea, and commune members can capture dragons. Working with the secretary from morning till night, we are not afraid of any difficulties, no matter how great." Liu Jingye, a young commune member, and Li Kaimo, an old farmer, from the No. 2 team of the Panlong Management Area, jointly shouldered the threshing work of a mixing barrel. Since Xu Jipin, the branch secretary, served as the mixing barrel team leader, they saw that Xu Jipin threshed quickly and carefully, turning the rice stalks over and over again a dozen or twenty times until there was not a single grain of rice left on the stalks. The two of them immediately launched a competition for fast and careful threshing and supervised and checked each other. Three days later, their team won the title of "Red Flag Barrel." Now, more than 1,000 people in the entire commune are exceeding their quotas every day and have become threshing pacesetters.

The Sanhe Commune Party Committee estimated that after the secretaries and cadres served as mixing barrel team leaders, some new problems would inevitably arise, such as how to lead comprehensively and how to arrange labor and work time, etc. In order to better implement this new leadership method, the Commune Party Committee adopted the following auxiliary measures at the beginning of the autumn harvest to guarantee it in all aspects:

1.  Assign areas of responsibility under contract, using points to lead areas. Each of the Commune Party Committee secretaries and the commune directors and deputy directors is responsible for a management area, each of the management area party branch secretaries and the directors and deputy directors is responsible for a production team, and each of the production team leaders and deputy leaders is responsible for three to five mixing barrels. Each of them uses a mixing barrel team as a base point to comprehensively guide the autumn harvest work within their assigned area. This makes the responsibilities clear and specific, which is conducive to a better combination of points and areas.

2.  Cadres seize the gaps of one or two minutes before and after meals every day to study, deploy, and check the overall work. The rest of the time is devoted to harvesting and threshing, and the work of the mixing barrel team leader is done conscientiously. Because this method is widely used throughout the commune, cadres at the management area level spend more than 80% of their time and cadres at the production team level spend more than 90% of their time directly participating in harvesting and threshing.

3.  Reduce meetings and save non-production time to ensure that cadres have both work and rest after serving as mixing barrel team leaders. The Commune Party Committee clearly stipulates that the time for cadres to hold meetings every day shall not exceed half an hour, and it must be ensured that cadres can go to bed before 10:00 p.m. This enables cadres to participate in harvesting and threshing with commune members with vigor the next day and take the lead in creating high efficiency. To achieve this, the Commune Party Committee particularly emphasized that meetings must be fully prepared, with brief speeches, focused issues, and clear objectives. During the autumn harvest, all kinds of meetings basically met this requirement.

4.  Launch a commune-wide autumn harvest assessment and competition movement centered on the "Secretary Barrel" and "Cadre Barrel." Every night, the secretaries of the various party branches and cadres at all levels must first report on the completion of the tasks of the mixing barrel team they are in when reporting the progress of the autumn harvest to the Commune Party Committee. If the work efficiency of the "Secretary Barrel" and "Cadre Barrel" far exceeds or is lower than the efficiency of the average mixing barrel team, they cannot be awarded the winner's red flag. Only if they themselves have reached the advanced standard and have driven the average barrel to also reach the advanced standard can they become true winners. At present, the mid-season rice in the entire commune has entered the stage of full-scale rush harvesting. More than 40% of the mixing barrel teams have exceeded the quota of 1,500 jin of harvesting and threshing per day, of which the "Secretary Barrel" and "Cadre Barrel" account for more than half.

### 书记、干部担任拌桶组长　包干负责收、打、运、藏  三合公社领导秋收办法扎实  中稻收打工效高、质量高，将比去年提前十天收完，抛撒现象基本消灭

    书记、干部担任拌桶组长　包干负责收、打、运、藏
    三合公社领导秋收办法扎实
    中稻收打工效高、质量高，将比去年提前十天收完，抛撒现象基本消灭
    本报成都17日电　四川省江油县三合人民公社各级党组织的书记和90％以上的干部，深入秋收最前线，担任拌桶组组长，以拌桶组为核心，包干负责收、打、运、藏各个环节，使当前的秋收工作进行得适时，精细，井井有条。预计全部收打结束，将比往年提前十天左右，并基本上消灭了抛撒浪费现象。
    拌桶组是秋收的最基层劳动组织。一架拌桶共五人：二人割，二人打，一人运。书记、干部深入基层担任拌桶组组长，这是三合公社党委根据省委关于加强秋收领导的指示和当前形势提出的一项领导秋收的新的领导方法。今年，全社的情况是：80％以上的劳力集中到第一线；中稻的品种一致，成熟期比较整齐；秋种、秋管任务比去年大。这个情况要求领导迅速跟上去，要求领导更具体切实。为此，这个公社决定五名公社党委书记、二十四名管理区支部书记和三百二十三名生产队长以上干部，在秋收期间全部下去担任拌桶组组长，并以“书记桶”“干部桶”作为领导核心，保证秋收工作在高工效、高质量的情况下全面顺利进行。
    书记、干部担任拌桶组长以后，收打质量显著提高，每亩抛撒浪费的数量由占产量的7％—8％降低到2％左右。公社党委第一书记王洪钧，在担任拌桶组长的第一天，就将拌桶加围、加顶、加帘，收割时轻提、轻割、轻放，脱粒时谷穗放齐、散开、勤抖，结果一亩地打了五百七十二斤，打完后田里不见谷穗、谷粒。当时邻近的一架拌桶由于没有采取这些办法，收打了与这亩地完全一样的一亩地，结果只打了五百二十三斤。当天晚上，公社党委就以这个事实在社员中进行对比教育，社员不但认识到了精打细收的重要意义，而且提出了更多的精打细收的办法。
    书记、干部在担任拌桶组长后，由于情况了如指掌，经常根据实际需要，灵活调配劳力，使收、打、运、藏环环紧扣。在一个拌桶组内，一般是早上收割比较紧张，就以多数人突击收割；中午脱粒比较紧张，就以多数人突击打谷；下午挑运入仓比较紧张，就以多数人突击运和藏；哪里最紧张，书记、干部就到哪里参加劳动，具体领导。组与组、队与队之间，也经常根据实际情况，互相协作支援，做到了熟一块收一块、打完一块，全社中稻都做到了适时收割。
    书记、干部担任拌桶组长后，还及时发现、总结、推广了各种先进经验，大大促进了全社的秋收进度。现在全社采用的一整套共十多种快速收打办法，都是书记、干部在同社员共同收打中发现、总结的。
    书记、干部担任拌桶组长，和社员并肩劳动，大大鼓舞了社员的劳动热情。群众说，“干部能下海，社员能擒龙，从早到晚和书记一起劳动，天大的困难也不怕。”蟠龙管区二队青年社员刘敬冶和老农李开模，共同负担一架拌桶的打谷工作，自从支部书记徐继品担任拌桶组长后，他们看见徐继品打得又快又细心，一把稻子要翻来复去地打一、二十次，直到稻秆上一粒谷子也不剩为止，他们二人立即开展了快打细打的竞赛，并互相督促检查，三天后，他们组就获得了“红旗桶”的称号。现在，全社已经有一千多人天天突破定额，成为打谷标兵。
    三合公社党委估计到，书记、干部担任拌桶组组长后，必然会出现一些新的问题，例如如何领导全面，如何安排劳动、工作时间等等，为了更好地实施这一新的领导方法，公社党委在秋收一开始就采取了以下一些辅助措施，从各方面加以保证：
    一、划片包干、以点带片。公社党委书记和正、副社长每人分工负责一个管理区，管理区党支部书记和正、副主任每人分工负责一个生产队，生产队正、副队长每人分工负责三至五架拌桶。他们每人都以一个拌桶组作为基点，来全面指导分工范围内的秋收工作。这样责任明确具体，便于点与片的更好结合。
    二、干部每天抓紧饭前饭后一、二十分钟的空隙时间，研究、布置、检查全盘工作，其余时间全部参加收打，认真做好拌桶组长的工作。由于全社普遍采用了这种办法，管理区一级干部每天有80％以上时间、生产队一级干部每天有90％以上时间直接参加收打。
    三、精减会议，节约非生产时间，保证干部担任拌桶组长后有劳有逸。公社党委明确规定每天干部开会的时间不得超过半小时，必须保证干部能在晚上十时以前就寝。这就使得干部第二天能够精力充沛地和社员一起参加收打，并带头创造高工效。为了做到这一点，公社党委特别强调开会必须要充分准备，发言简短、问题集中、目的明确。秋收中，各种会议都基本达到了这个要求。
    四、以“书记桶”“干部桶”为中心，开展全社的秋收评比竞赛运动。各个党支部的书记和各级干部，每晚向公社党委汇报秋收进度时，必须首先报告自己所在的拌桶组完成任务的情况，如果“书记桶”“干部桶”的工作效率远远超过或者低于一般拌桶组的工效，都不能获得优胜红旗，必须是自己达到了先进标准并带动一般桶也达到了先进标准，才能成为真正的优胜者。现在，全公社的中稻已进入全面抢收阶段，有40％多的拌桶组突破了一天收打一千五百斤的定额，其中“书记桶”“干部桶”占一半以上。（附图片）
