Xinhua News Agency Report: Guangdong is implementing the agricultural production policy of "taking grain as the key link and promoting all-round development," and while vigorously developing agriculture and grain production, it is resolutely grasping the production of economic crops and oil crops.

The sown area of ​​various economic crops in Guangdong Province this year has been expanded compared with last year. Judging from the yields of crops that have already been harvested, although the province suffered various natural disasters such as floods, droughts, and typhoons in the first half of this year, the hard work of the broad masses of cadres and people has minimized the losses. Economic crops that have not yet been harvested are growing vigorously.

At present, Guangdong is seizing the crucial season for the growth of various economic crops in August, September, and October, to further vigorously improve field management and expand the planting of autumn economic crops. The sugarcane producing areas are, on the premise of doing a good job in field management of grain crops, concentrating part of the labor force to rush to fertilize, cultivate soil, eliminate insects, and irrigate sugarcane fields, vigorously processing and adding fertilizer to vigorously attack the autumn shoots of sugarcane. Fruit producing areas have launched a high-yield movement and are grasping field management. Heping Commune in Chaoyang County is diligently managing and carefully cultivating the land, protecting the fruits and strengthening the fruits, and trying every means to ensure that the commune's more than 7,000 mu of Chaozhou oranges can achieve a good harvest.

Xinhua News Agency Report: Jiangxi is implementing the policy of "taking grain as the key link and promoting all-round development," rationally arranging leadership and labor, and strengthening the late-stage management of various economic crops, striving for a large-scale balanced increase in production.

This year, Jiangxi's more than 2 million mu of economic crops such as cotton, sugarcane, and jute have generally grown well despite suffering from natural disasters such as cold waves, overcast and rainy weather, and droughts, due to timely and meticulous management. The Jiangxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China requires all localities to seize the peak growth period in August and launch a large-scale balanced production increase movement. According to the instructions of the Provincial Party Committee, all economic crop areas have generally fixed special personnel to lead, properly arranged labor, and organized semi-labor forces such as women and children, as well as various professional teams, to carry out late-stage management work such as drought resistance, insect extermination, soil cultivation, and topdressing for various economic crops while vigorously grasping the field management of late rice. In order to ensure the normal growth of crops, efforts were concentrated in areas where droughts and pests occurred in a timely manner to fight drought and eliminate pests.

All localities have also identified and classified the crops one by one according to the type of crops, and carried out meticulous scientific management according to the characteristics and growth conditions of different crops to accelerate the growth of crops.

Xinhua News Agency Report: Peanut producing areas in Shandong are carrying out late-stage field management of peanuts centered on topdressing, soil cultivation, and weed eradication to promote more peanut fruiting and plump kernels.

At present, the growth of peanuts in Shandong has entered the period of pod expansion and fruiting. Major peanut producing areas such as Penglai, Muping, and Haiyang have generally held forums combining cadres, technicians, and experienced farmers to widely summarize and exchange experiences in late-stage management of peanuts, and to determine that high-yield fields and first-class seedlings should be heavily topdressed with phosphorus and potassium fertilizers and cut vines to prevent excessive growth; late-stubble and third-class seedlings should continue to be cultivated with soil and topdressed with quick-acting fertilizers.

    广东  江西加强管理经济作物
    山东各地为花生追肥培土锄草
    据新华社讯　广东贯彻“以粮为纲，全面发展”的农业生产方针，在大办农业、大办粮食生产的同时，坚决抓好经济作物和油料作物的生产。
    今年广东省的各种经济作物播种面积都比去年扩大。从已收成的作物产量来看，今年上半年虽然连遭水、旱、风等各种自然灾害的袭击，但是，由于广大干部和群众的艰苦奋斗，使损失减少到最低限度。没有收获的经济作物，长势旺盛。
    目前，广东各地正抓紧8、9、10月份各种经济作物生长有决定意义的季节，进一步大力搞好田间管理和秋季经济作物的扩种工作。甘蔗产区最近正在搞好粮食田间管理的前提下，集中部分劳动力，突击给蔗田施肥、培土、除虫、灌水，大力加工加肥，猛攻甘蔗秋笋。水果产区开展了高额丰产运动，大抓田间管理。潮阳县和平公社勤管精培，保果壮果，千方百计争取全社七千多亩潮州柑能取得好收成。
    据新华社讯　江西各地贯彻“以粮为纲，全面发展”的方针，合理安排领导力量和劳力，加强对各种经济作物的后期管理工作，力争大面积平衡增产。
    今年，江西二百多万亩棉花、甘蔗、黄麻等经济作物，虽然遭受了寒潮、阴雨和干旱等自然灾害，但由于管理及时细致，普遍生长良好。中共江西省委要求各地抓紧8月生长旺期，深入开展一个大面积平衡增产运动。各经济作物地区根据省委的指示，都普遍固定了专人领导，妥善安排劳力，组织妇女、儿童等半劳力和各种专业队，在狠抓晚稻田间管理的同时，对各种经济作物进行抗旱灭虫、中耕追肥等后期管理工作。为确保作物的正常生长，在部分发生干旱和虫害的地区，都及时集中力量抗旱灭虫。
    各地还按照作物的种类，逐块鉴定、分类排队，根据不同作物的特点和生长情况进行了精细的科学管理，加速作物的生长。
    据新华社讯　山东各花生产地开展以追肥、培土和消灭杂草为中心的花生后期田间管理，促使花生多结果，果仁肥大饱满。
    目前，山东各地花生的生长已进入荚果膨大和成果时期。蓬莱、牟平、海阳等花生主要产地普遍召开干部、技术员、老农三结合的座谈会，广泛地总结交流花生后期管理的经验，确定丰产田和一类苗大追磷钾肥和剪蔓，以防疯长；对晚茬和三类苗则继续培土，追施速效肥。
