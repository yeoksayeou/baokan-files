Xinhua News Agency, 28th dispatch from New York: U.S. President Eisenhower and British Prime Minister Macmillan held a two-and-a-half-hour meeting in New York on the 27th.

The statement issued after the meeting indicates that the United States, with the support of Britain, will intensify the use of the United Nations as a tool for pursuing an aggressive policy, especially for annexing the Congo, and will support Hammarskjöld, who faithfully implements this aggressive policy. The statement affirmed that the U.S. and Britain "pursue policies to achieve common goals," and said, "They are in complete agreement on the important role of the United Nations, especially in the Congo crisis, and the necessity of fully supporting the Secretary-General in carrying out his work."

The statement also said that they hoped that the United Nations General Assembly, especially on the issue of disarmament, "will concentrate its efforts on serious, sober, and constructive work." However, after this statement was read out, spokesmen for both countries immediately emphasized that the U.S. attitude remains that the United Nations General Assembly is not the place for disarmament negotiations.

　  艾森豪威尔和麦克米伦共谋
　　加紧利用联合国侵略刚果
    新华社28日讯　纽约消息：美国总统艾森豪威尔和英国首相麦克米伦27日在纽约举行了两个半小时的会谈。
    会谈结束后发表的声明表明，美国在英国的支持下将要加紧利用联合国作为推行侵略政策，特别是鲸吞刚果的工具，并且为忠实推行这种侵略政策的哈马舍尔德撑腰。声明肯定了美英两国“为了实现共同目的而奉行的政策”，并且说：“对于联合国的重要作用，特别是在刚果危机中的重要作用以及充分支持秘书长进行他的工作的必要性，他们的意见完全一致。”
    声明还说什么希望联合国大会特别在裁军问题上“将集中力量从事认真的、清醒的以及建设性的工作。”但是在这个声明宣读后两国的发言人随即强调指出，美国的态度目前仍然是：联合国大会不是进行裁军谈判的场所。
