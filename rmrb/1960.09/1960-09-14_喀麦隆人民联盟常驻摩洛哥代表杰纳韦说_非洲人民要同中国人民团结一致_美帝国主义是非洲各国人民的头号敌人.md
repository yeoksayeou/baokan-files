Xinhua News Agency, Rabat, September 11th. Djenevey Nicanor, the permanent representative of the Cameroon People's Union to Morocco, told Xinhua News Agency today that the African people must unite with the Chinese people and form a strong front with them to overthrow imperialism, because China is an important bastion against imperialism.

He said that President Sékou Touré's visit to China would help bring the African people closer to the Chinese people. The future of Africa lies in solidarity with the Chinese people and the people of socialist countries.

He said, "Today, the main goal pursued by our party is to strengthen the necessary links connecting the people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America, in order to launch a final offensive against moribund imperialism. This policy of uniting all oppressed people, or people who have been oppressed and exploited, is the only way to oppose the imperialist camp and successfully deal with the new ruling system, namely neo-colonialism." He emphasized: "Now is the time for the people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America to understand that they must unite in a truly active and powerful solidarity movement."

Djenevey Nicanor also pointed out that the imperialists are currently launching a frantic counterattack. U.S. monopoly capitalist Harriman's current trip to Africa is part of a movement launched by imperialism aimed at salvaging their crumbling positions in Africa.

He continued, U.S. imperialism has played, and continues to play, a particularly harmful role in obstructing the liberation of the oppressed people of all countries, especially the African people. Because U.S. imperialism supports the wars waged by France in Cameroon and Algeria, it has become a direct criminal causing Africans to bleed in these wars. He said: "Facts have proven that U.S. imperialism is the number one enemy of the African people struggling for their liberation."

Speaking of the relationship between the Chinese people and the Cameroonian people and the African people, he said: "The Chinese people have never been stingy in giving us support. The Chinese people's increasing concern for our struggle is, in fact, proof of their unwavering loyalty to the struggle against imperialism and the principle of proletarian solidarity. The Cameroonian people draw and strengthen the courage necessary for their revolutionary struggle from the support given by the great Chinese people. The rich experience accumulated by the Chinese people in the victorious war against imperialism and its running dogs for twenty-eight years, as well as the achievements in economic construction, the achievements of the Great Leap Forward and the People's Communes, all these are examples for the African people to follow, because the African people's struggles and living conditions are not very different from those of China. Therefore, it is only natural for the African people to look to China."

Speaking of the Cameroonian people's struggle for national liberation, he pointed out: The Cameroonian people are continuing and intensifying their struggle. The unity of the Cameroonian people is growing stronger. The Cameroonian people firmly believe that they have made a contribution to the African liberation struggle.

Djenevey Nicanor condemned West German militarists and U.S. imperialists for vigorously supporting France's aggression against the Algerian and Cameroonian people.

Speaking of the Congo issue, he said, "The imperialists are constantly plotting conspiracies to overthrow the legitimate government of the Congo." He continued: "The United Nations forces stationed in the Congo are the main tool used by imperialism to enslave the Congolese people. Now the United Nations has torn off its mask, exposing its true face as an organization that obeys U.S. imperialism, and its role is to use every means to combat the revolutionary enthusiasm of the oppressed people of all countries."

    喀麦隆人民联盟常驻摩洛哥代表杰纳韦说
    非洲人民要同中国人民团结一致
    美帝国主义是非洲各国人民的头号敌人
    新华社拉巴特11日电　喀麦隆人民联盟常驻摩洛哥代表杰纳韦·尼卡诺尔今天向新华社记者发表谈话时说，非洲各国人民必需同中国人民联合起来，并同中国人民结成一个强大的阵线来推翻帝国主义，因为中国是反对帝国主义的重要堡垒。
    他说，塞古·杜尔总统访问中国将有助于非洲各国人民同中国人民的接近。非洲的前途在于同中国人民和社会主义各国人民的团结一致。
    他说，“今天，我们党追求的主要目标，是加强把亚洲、非洲各国人民和拉丁美洲人民联结起来的必要联系，以便对日暮途穷的帝国主义发动最后进攻。这种把所有被压迫人民或曾受压迫和剥削的人民联合在一起的政策，是反对帝国主义阵营，胜利地对付新的统治制度，即新殖民主义的唯一办法。”他强调说：“现在是亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲各国人民应该懂得必须联合在一个真正起积极作用的、强大的团结运动中的时候了。”
    杰纳韦·尼卡诺尔还指出，帝国主义者目前发动了疯狂的反扑。美国垄断资本家哈里曼正在非洲进行的旅行，是帝国主义所发动的、旨在挽救他们在非洲摇摇欲坠的阵地的运动的一个部分。
    他继续说道，美帝国主义对被压迫各国人民，尤其是非洲各国人民的解放起了而且继续在起着特别有害的阻碍作用。由于美帝国主义支持法国在喀麦隆和阿尔及利亚进行的战争，它已成为使非洲人在这些战争中流血的直接行凶作恶的罪犯。他说：“事实已经证明美帝国主义是为争取自己的解放而斗争的非洲各国人民的头号敌人”。
    在谈到中国人民同喀麦隆人民以及非洲各国人民的关系时，他说：“中国人民从来不吝啬给予我们以支持。中国人民对于我们的斗争的日益增加的关心，在事实上证明了他们坚持不渝地忠于反对帝国主义的斗争和无产阶级团结的原则。喀麦隆人民从伟大的中国人民给予的支持中，汲取和加强了自己在革命斗争中所必需的勇气。中国人民在二十八年中反对帝国主义及其走狗的胜利战争中所积累起来的丰富经验，以及在经济建设方面的成就、大跃进和人民公社的成就，这一切对非洲各国人民来说都是可供效法的榜样，因为非洲各国人民的斗争和生活条件同中国并没有很大的不同。因此，非洲各国人民注视着中国，这是情理之常。”
    他在谈到喀麦隆人民所进行的争取民族解放的斗争的时候指出：喀麦隆人民正在继续和加紧进行斗争。喀麦隆人民的团结正在日益加强。喀麦隆人民坚信，他们对非洲的解放斗争作出了贡献。
    杰纳韦·尼卡诺尔谴责了西德军国主义者和美帝国主义者大力支持法国对阿尔及利亚和喀麦隆人民进行的侵略。
    他在谈到刚果问题时说，“帝国主义者正在不断策划阴谋，企图推翻刚果合法政府”。他接着说：“联合国派驻刚果的部队，是帝国主义用以奴役刚果人民的主要工具。现在联合国已经撕下假面具，暴露了它是听命于美帝国主义的一个组织的真面目，它所起的作用是用尽一切办法来打击被压迫各国人民的革命热情”。
