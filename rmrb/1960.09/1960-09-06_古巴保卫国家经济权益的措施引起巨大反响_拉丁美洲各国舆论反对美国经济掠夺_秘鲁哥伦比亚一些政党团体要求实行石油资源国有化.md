Cuba's Measures to Defend National Economic Rights Spark Huge Repercussions
Latin American Public Opinion Opposes US Economic Plunder
Some Political Parties and Groups in Peru and Colombia Demand Nationalization of Oil Resources

Xinhua News Agency—The example of the Cuban government nationalizing American companies has resonated greatly in Latin America.

The leaders of the Venezuelan Oil and Construction Workers Union stated that the Cuban government's example of nationalizing American companies is beneficial to the future of Latin America. Students expressed their sympathy and support for the Cuban government's actions through newspapers and cartoons. "People's Forum" published an article stating that Venezuela should follow Cuba's patriotic actions by taking actions that benefit its own economy.

Members of the People's Radical Civic Union in Argentina recently proposed a bill to declare the abolition of all so-called oil development contracts signed with American companies.

Xinhua News Agency, Lima, September 2nd—The Political Committee of the Peruvian Communist Party issued a statement opposing the oil law draft submitted by the Peruvian government to the House of Representatives on the 1st, which submits to American monopoly organizations. The statement demanded the nationalization of oil, calling on the people to unite around the National Front for the Defense of Oil and launch a more vigorous struggle for oil nationalization. The Social Progress Party also issued a statement opposing this draft.

The Peruvian government's oil law draft was put forward against the background of the unanimous opposition of the broad masses of the Peruvian people to the American monopoly capital's occupation of oil resources and the demand for oil nationalization. The draft stipulates the maximum area of oil concessions, rents, export taxes, profit tax rates, and the duration of concessions. The draft was met with opposition from all walks of life after its release.

The American International Petroleum Company controls 80% of Peru's oil production. Lima sources criticized that the concession area stipulated in the oil law draft only makes the American company give up 60,000 hectares of non-productive land it controls; the draft stipulates a concession period of thirty years, during which the oil resources will actually be almost completely depleted.

In Colombia, a movement demanding the abolition of the contract signed by the former dictatorship and the American-funded Forest Oil Company, which allows American monopoly capital to plunder Colombian resources in large quantities, is unfolding widely. "Democratic Voice" in Bogota pointed out in an August 25th commentary that the current oil exploitation system allows foreign monopoly groups to carry out the most shameless plunder of Colombia's huge oil wealth, allowing foreign companies to obtain unlimited concessions of large tracts of land. These companies currently occupy nearly 26 million hectares of land in Colombia. This system stipulates that the country's share in oil exploitation is only 8%, while foreign companies sell Colombian oil to Colombia at the dollar price on the international market.

The Colombian working class stands at the forefront of this movement. The Colombian Workers' Confederation and the Petroleum Federation recently issued a joint statement calling on all workers' organizations to participate in the patriotic struggle, strive to amend the oil law, and strive to abolish the contracts signed by the former dictatorial government and American-funded companies. Many political figures in Colombia also advocate abolishing the contracts signed with American companies. Some Colombian congressmen recently spoke in the House of Representatives, accusing American-funded oil companies of plundering Colombian national resources and exploiting workers, and advocating the nationalization of oil. Samuel Arango Reyes, manager of the Colombian Petroleum Company, also published a statement in the newspaper on August 22, condemning the unfair contract signed between the Colombian Petroleum Company and the American-funded Forest Oil Company, and demanding the abolition of this contract.

According to "El Siglo", Colombian President Lleras recently issued an order to re-examine all contracts signed by the country with foreign oil companies.

The Guatemalan Patriotic Alliance, composed of Guatemalans residing in Mexico, recently published a statement in the Mexican newspaper "El Informador," condemning the plunder of American imperialism and the Fuentes government of Guatemala's policy of submitting to the United States. The statement said that the oil concessions plundered by American oil monopolies account for about half of Guatemala's national land area, and the forces of the American "United Fruit Company" and other companies control the entire Guatemala.

The statement emphasized that American armed intervention has hindered the development of democracy in Guatemala. The statement also exposed the Fuentes government for creating excuses, implementing anti-people martial law, carrying out bloody crackdowns on the people, and taking other reactionary measures.

The statement finally called on public opinion in the Western Hemisphere to rise up to defend the Cuban people and their revolution, and to defend the sacred principles of non-interference and the right of peoples to self-determination.

    古巴保卫国家经济权益的措施引起巨大反响
    拉丁美洲各国舆论反对美国经济掠夺
    秘鲁哥伦比亚一些政党团体要求实行石油资源国有化
    本报讯　古巴政府把美国公司收归国有的榜样，在拉丁美洲引起了巨大的反响。
    委内瑞拉石油和建筑工会的领导人表示，古巴政府把美国公司收归国有的榜样对拉丁美洲的前途是有益的。大学生通过报纸和漫画表示他们对古巴政府采取的行动的同情和支持。“人民论坛报”发表文章说，委内瑞拉应该继古巴的爱国行动之后采取有利于自己经济的行动。
    阿根廷人民激进公民联盟的众议员们最近提出了一项法案，这项法案规定宣布废除一切同美国公司签订的所谓开发石油的合同。
    新华社利马2日电　秘鲁共产党政治委员会发表声明，反对秘鲁政府1日向众议院提出的屈从于美国垄断组织的石油法草案。声明要求实现石油国有化，号召人民团结在全国保卫石油阵线的周围，为争取石油国有化展开更有力的斗争。社会进步党也发表声明表示反对这个草案。
    秘鲁政府的这个石油法草案是在秘鲁全国广大人民一致反对美国垄断资本霸占石油资源、要求石油国有化的情况下提出的。草案规定了出让石油租让地的最大面积、租金、出口税额和利润税率以及租让的期限。草案公布后遭到各界人士的反对。
    美国国际石油公司控制了秘鲁石油生产的80％。利马人士批评石油法草案规定的租让地面积只是使美国公司放弃它所控制的六万公顷的非生产地；草案规定租让期限三十年，在这一期限内石油资源实际上将被开采殆尽。
    本报讯　在哥伦比亚，一个要求废除前独裁政权和美资福莱斯特石油公司签订的合同的运动正广泛地展开着。这个合同，使得美国垄断资本大量掠夺哥伦比亚的资源。波哥大“民主呼声报”在8月25日的评论里就指出，目前的石油开采制度使得外国垄断集团可以对哥伦比亚的巨大的石油财富进行最无耻的掠夺，使得外国公司可以无限制地取得大片土地的租让权，这些公司目前霸占着哥伦比亚的近二千六百万公顷的土地。这个制度规定国家在石油开采中的份额只有8％，而外国公司却把哥伦比亚的石油以国际市场上的美元价格卖给哥伦比亚。
    哥伦比亚的工人阶级，站在这个运动的最前列。哥伦比亚工人联合会和石油联合会最近曾发表联合声明，号召各工人组织参加爱国主义的斗争，争取修改石油法，争取废除前独裁政府和美资公司签订的合同。哥伦比亚不少政界人士也主张废除同美国公司所签订的合同。哥伦比亚的一些众议员最近在众议院的发言中，就指责美资石油公司掠夺哥伦比亚民族资源，剥削工人的行为，并且主张实行石油国有化。哥伦比亚石油公司经理萨穆埃耳·阿兰戈·雷耶斯8月22日也在报纸上发表谈话，谴责哥伦比亚石油公司和美资福莱斯特石油公司之间签订的不公道的合同，并且要求废除这项合同。
    据“世纪报”报道，哥伦比亚总统耶拉斯最近发布了关于重新审查这个国家同外国石油公司签订的所有合同的命令。
    本报讯　由居住在墨西哥的危地马拉人组成的危地马拉爱国联盟最近在墨西哥“新闻报”上发表声明，谴责美帝国主义的掠夺和危地马拉富恩特斯政府屈从美国的政策。声明说，美国石油垄断组织掠夺的石油租让地约占危地马拉全国土地面积的一半，美国“联合果品公司”和其他公司的势力控制了整个危地马拉。
    声明强调指出，美国的武装干涉阻碍了危地马拉民主的发展。声明同时揭露富恩特斯政府制造借口，实行反人民的戒严、对人民进行血腥的打击和采取其他反动措施。
    声明最后要求西半球的舆论起来保卫古巴人民和他们的革命，保卫神圣的不干涉的原则和人民的自决权。
