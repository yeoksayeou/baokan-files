Xinhua News Agency, September 26th. Newspapers in Korea, Albania, Czechoslovakia and Bulgaria have recently published editorials and commentaries, unanimously supporting the restoration of the People's Republic of China's legitimate seat in the United Nations, and condemning US imperialism for manipulating its vassal states in the United Nations to repeatedly allow the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang to illegally remain in the United Nations.

The Korean "Rodong Sinmun" published an editorial on the 20th, pointing out that the issue of restoring the People's Republic of China's legitimate status in the United Nations, which has long remained unresolved by the United Nations, is the most important issue that is now pressing. It goes without saying that as long as the abnormal situation in which the People's Republic of China, representing 650 million Chinese people, is excluded from the United Nations continues, the United Nations cannot successfully fulfill its tasks.

The editorial pointed out that due to the conspiratorial activities of US imperialism, which fears the existence of the People's Republic of China and the expansion of its influence, this issue (the issue of restoring China's seat in the United Nations) has not been resolved for more than ten years, and the People's Republic of China's legitimate seat in the United Nations has been soiled by Chiang Kai-shek, a zombie. This is intolerable.

The restoration of the People's Republic of China's legitimate status in the United Nations is a matter within China's scope of authority that no one can deny.

The United Nations can no longer allow the absurd situation in which US imperialism and its voting machine refuse China's right year after year.

The editorial said that US imperialism is again attempting to create a "Tibetan issue" at this session of the United Nations General Assembly, which does not exist at all, in an attempt to launch a movement against the restoration of the People's Republic of China's legitimate seat in the United Nations.

An editorial in the Korean "Democratic Korea" newspaper said, "The most vicious enemy of national independence – US imperialism, stubbornly obstructs the issue of restoring the legitimate rights of the great socialist power, the People's Republic of China, in the United Nations, thereby damaging the noble purpose of the United Nations for a long time. However, everyone clearly knows that without excluding the great Chinese people, who account for a quarter of the world's population today, and their legitimate government, it is impossible to solve important international political issues." The editorial said that restoring the representation of the People's Republic of China is an urgent issue that cannot be delayed any longer. The Soviet government has put forward this mature demand to the current General Assembly, and all the countries of the socialist camp and the majority of Asian and African countries unanimously demand the expulsion of the Chiang Kai-shek clique, which has become a zombie.

The Albanian "Zëri i Popullit" (Voice of the People) said in a commentary on the 20th, "The people of all countries demand that the People's Republic of China occupy its due position in this organization. The fact that the zombie of Taiwan occupies China's position in the United Nations clearly shows the aggressive intentions of the US imperialists towards this great peace-loving country on this issue. This fact is incompatible with the principles of the UN Charter and is a malicious trampling on these principles."

The Czechoslovak "Rudé Právo" (Red Right) published a commentary on the 22nd entitled "Chiang Kai-shek Barks at the Moon," condemning the General Assembly's Executive Chairman for giving Chiang Kai-shek elements the right to speak.

The commentary said that the peace-loving people of all countries have full reason to demand that this "stinking corpse" represented by the Chiang Kai-shek elements be unceremoniously and finally thrown out of the United Nations, so that the true representatives of China, the representatives of the People's Republic of China, can occupy their legitimate seat.

The Bulgarian "Rabotnichesko Delo" (Workers' Cause) published an editorial on the 26th on the issue of restoring China's seat in the United Nations, pointing out that the current 15th session of the UN General Assembly must resolve a particularly important and urgent issue – the issue of China's representation in the United Nations. This is the eleventh year that this issue has been raised in the United Nations. So far, the US ruling clique has manipulated the majority of countries that depend on it, and has obstructed the resolution of this issue ten times. However, the public in all countries, including the United States, unanimously believes that the situation in which China's seat is occupied by the political corpse of Chiang Kai-shek, who does not represent anyone, is abnormal. The people of all countries are increasingly firmly demanding the elimination of this absurd and ridiculous thing.

The commentary pointed out that without the participation of the true representatives of the great Chinese people in the United Nations, it is difficult to resolve international disputes. Not allowing China to enter the United Nations has also brought serious damage to the United Nations itself.

The commentary concluded by saying: The Bulgarian people and the people of the Soviet Union and other socialist countries, together with sound-minded people all over the world, firmly advocate that the People's Republic of China should occupy the legitimate seat of the United Nations and expel the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique.

　　朝阿捷保报纸先后发表评论
　　谴责美帝国主义敌视中国的罪恶政策
　　要求恢复我国在联合国中的合法席位
    新华社26日讯　朝鲜、阿尔巴尼亚、捷克斯洛伐克和保加利亚等国报纸最近先后发表社论和评论，一致支持恢复中华人民共和国在联合国的合法席位，并且谴责美帝国主义操纵它在联合国中的仆从国多数一再让蒋介石匪帮分子非法赖在联合国的行为。
    朝鲜“劳动新闻”20日发表社论指出，联合国长期未能解决的恢复中华人民共和国在联合国中的合法地位问题，是迫在眉睫的最重要的问题。不言而喻，只要代表着六亿五千万中国人民的中华人民共和国被排除在联合国之外的不正常状态持续下去，联合国就不可能圆满地完成自己的任务。
    社论指出，由于害怕中华人民共和国的存在和它的影响扩大的美帝国主义阴谋活动，十多年来这个问题（恢复中国在联合国席位问题）一直没有得到解决，而中华人民共和国在联合国中的合法席位却被蒋介石这样一个僵尸弄脏了。这是不可容忍的事情。
    中华人民共和国恢复自己在联合国中的合法地位，这是谁也不能拒绝的属于中国的权限范围的问题。
    联合国不能再容许美帝国主义及其表决机器年年拒绝中国的这一权限的荒唐透顶的状态。
    社论说，美帝国主义又企图在这次联合国大会上制造一个根本不存在的“西藏问题”，妄图掀起一场反对恢复中华人民共和国在联合国中的合法席位的运动。
    朝鲜“民主朝鲜报”的社论说，“民族独立的最凶恶的敌人——美帝国主义顽固地阻挠恢复伟大的社会主义强国中华人民共和国在联合国内的合法权利的问题，从而长期地损害了联合国的崇高目的。但是，谁都清楚地知道，把今天占世界人口四分之一的伟大的中国人民和他们的合法政府排除在外，就不能解决重要的国际政治问题。”社论说，恢复中华人民共和国的代表权是不能再迟延的迫切需要解决的问题。苏联政府向本届联大提出了这一成熟的要求，全体社会主义阵营国家同亚非大多数国家一致要求驱逐已成为僵尸的蒋介石集团。
    阿尔巴尼亚“团结报”20日在评论中说，“各国人民都要求中华人民共和国在这个组织中占有应有的地位。台湾的僵尸占据着中国在联合国的地位，这是最清楚不过地表明了美帝国主义者在此问题上对这个伟大的爱好和平国家的侵略目的。这个事实同联合国宪章原则是不相容的，是对这些原则极恶的践踏。”
    捷克斯洛伐克“红色权利报”22日发表题为“蒋介石对着月亮狂吠”的评论，谴责了联大执行主席给蒋介石分子以发言权的行为。
    评论说，爱好和平的各国人民有充分理由要求把蒋介石分子所代表的这个“发臭的尸体”不客气地最终地从联合国中扔出去，让中国真正的代表——中华人民共和国的代表占有自己的合法席位。
    保加利亚“工人事业报”26日就恢复中国在联合国的席位问题发表的社论指出，现在的联大十五届会议要解决一个特别重要而刻不容缓的问题——中国在联合国的代表权问题。在联合国提出这个问题已是第十一年了。到目前为止，美国统治集团操纵依赖它的国家的多数，曾十次阻挠解决这个问题。但是包括美国在内的所有国家的公众都一致认为中国的席位被不代表任何人的蒋介石政治死尸占据着的这种状况是不正常的。各国人民日益坚决要求消除这种荒谬绝伦的蠢事。
    评论指出，没有伟大中国人民的真正的代表参加联合国，有碍于解决国际争端。不让中国进入联合国，对联合国自己也带来了严重的损害。
    评论最后说：保加利亚人民和苏联及其他社会主义国家的人民，同全世界思想健全的人们一起，坚决主张中华人民共和国应占有联合国的合法席位，驱逐蒋介石卖国集团。
