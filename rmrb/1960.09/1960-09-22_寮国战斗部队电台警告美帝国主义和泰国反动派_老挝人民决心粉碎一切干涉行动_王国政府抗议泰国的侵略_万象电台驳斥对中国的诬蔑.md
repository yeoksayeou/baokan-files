Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 20th - The Lao Fighting Forces Radio issued a commentary today, pointing out that U.S. imperialism and the Thai authorities should be held responsible for their acts of interference and provocation in Laos.

The commentary said that while American warships and ships carrying weapons were active in areas such as the South China Sea, Thai reactionaries used mortars and machine guns to fire on Vientiane. On the same day, the Thai government prohibited people from traveling on the Mukdahan-Xieng Khouang route and sent spies and special agents to infiltrate Vientiane to carry out sabotage activities, such as throwing grenades at radio stations, destroying reservoirs, and firing mortars at Xieng Ke village and Ki Na Mo stronghold, as well as other places.

The commentary pointed out that since September 10th, South Vietnamese troops, in coordination with the Phoumi Nosavan-Boun Oum-Nachanphet group's activities to suppress and persecute the Lao people and prepare to attack Vientiane, have been conducting "sweeps" in the Lao-South Vietnam border areas.

The commentary pointed out that the above-mentioned actions of U.S. imperialism and its running dog reactionary groups are blatant provocations and deliberate acts of aggression against Laos. The Lao people resolutely oppose the above-mentioned insidious and despicable actions of U.S. imperialism, oppose the interference and aggression by the reactionary groups in the Thai government who are vigorously supporting the Phoumi Nosavan traitorous clique, and demand that they stop the above-mentioned actions.

The commentary concluded that the entire Lao people, together with their armed forces and the Kingdom's army, are determined not to allow domestic and foreign reactionary groups to trample on Laos' sovereignty and are determined to crush all their provocative and interfering actions.

Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 21st - Vientiane Radio broadcast today that the Lao Kingdom government has submitted a letter of protest to the Thai Ministry of Foreign Affairs through the Thai representative in Vientiane, protesting the aggressive act of artillery fire from the Thai riverbank on Vientiane on September 18th. The Lao Kingdom government has sent a copy of this letter of protest to the United Nations representative and various diplomatic envoys stationed in Vientiane.

In addition, the Lao Kingdom government sent a memorandum and materials concerning the tense relations between Laos and Thailand to the United Nations representative in Laos.

Vientiane Radio also condemned "Thailand's economic blockade of Vientiane."

According to a communiqué issued by Vientiane Radio on the 19th, mortars and machine guns were fired from the Thai riverbank side at three o'clock in the morning on September 18th, and accused the Thai riverbank of being used as a base for aggression and sabotage activities against Vientiane in the past week. Vientiane Radio also broadcast today: According to reliable sources: a Thai plane had airdropped weapons to the Phoumi Nosavan rebel group in Pak Song. The radio said that Phoumi Nosavan also received "reinforcements from across the Mekong River. Among these reinforcements are officers and soldiers who can speak Lao."

The Lao government requested the Thai government not to help the Phoumi Nosavan-Boun Oum-Nachanphet rebel group and harm the friendly relations between Laos and Thailand.

The radio opposed Thailand's interference in Laos' internal affairs and demanded that Laos be allowed to resolve its current internal political problems on its own.

Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 21st - The people of Bassac Province in southern Laos (one of the centers where the Phoumi Nosavan rebel group is entrenched), regardless of the obstruction of the Phoumi Nosavan rebel group, held rallies and demonstrations on September 16th to support the Phouma government's policy of peace, neutrality, and national harmony.

According to Vientiane Radio yesterday, this rally, attended by people from all walks of life and all ethnic groups, protested against the Phoumi Nosavan-Boun Oum-Nachanphet group's conspiracy to overthrow the Phouma government, attack Vientiane, and provoke a civil war in Laos.

According to the Lao Fighting Forces Radio, from August 21st to 27th, more than 1,200 people in some areas of Attapeu Province gathered, marched, and passed resolutions to support the Coup Committee and oppose the Phoumi Nosavan traitorous group. The report said that the people of Khamkeut County have also united to support the Phouma government's policy of peace, neutrality, and national harmony, and vigorously carry out anti-"sweep" campaigns.

Vientiane Radio broadcast today that the Standing Committee of the Lao National Assembly held a meeting on the 20th and decided to send an urgent telegram to the governors of Khammouane, Savannakhet, Bassac, Salavan and other provinces, asking the fourteen members of parliament who remained in Lower Laos since the coup on August 9th to return to Vientiane immediately to fulfill their parliamentary duties. The National Assembly announced that if these members of parliament still refuse to return, they will be dealt with in accordance with the regulations for members of parliament.

Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 21st - Vientiane Radio today refuted the rumors spread by Phoumi Nosavan recently broadcast by Thai radio, falsely claiming that "two divisions of the Chinese Communists have invaded northern Laos."

Vientiane Radio revealed that Phoumi Nosavan met with the commanders of the Kuomintang remnants in the Namtha area on September 7 this year and demanded that the Kuomintang remnants support him in attacking northern Laos.

According to Agence France-Presse, Lao Prime Minister Phouma also denied on the 20th the news that several battalions of "Viet Minh troops" had attacked Sam Neua in northern Laos. He said, "To my knowledge, there are no Viet Minh troops in Laos."

  “来自湄公河彼岸的援军。这些援军里面有能讲老挝话的官兵。”
    老挝政府要求泰国政府不要帮助富米·诺萨万—文翁·纳占巴塞叛乱集团，损害老挝和泰国之间的友好关系。
    电台反对泰国干涉老挝的内政，要求让老挝自己解决内部当前的政治问题。
    新华社河内21日电　老挝南部巴色省（富米·诺萨万叛乱集团盘踞中心之一）人民不顾富米·诺萨万叛乱集团的阻挠，于9月16日举行了集会和示威游行，支持富马政府的和平、中立和民族和睦政策。

    新华社河内21日电　万象电台今天驳斥了泰国电台最近广播的富米·诺萨万散布的谣言，胡说什么“中共的两个师侵略了北寮（老挝北部）”。
