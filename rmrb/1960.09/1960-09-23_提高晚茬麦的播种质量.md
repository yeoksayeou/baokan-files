Cultivating winter wheat requires each region to have its most suitable sowing period, and mastering the appropriate sowing time can increase yields. However, in actual production, it is impossible for all wheat fields to be sown within the most suitable few days. Hebei Province has a large wheat field area, and historically, there have been some late-planted wheat fields, generally accounting for about a quarter of all wheat fields. It is estimated that the proportion of late-planted wheat will increase to about one-third this year. Therefore, the yield of late-planted wheat has a great impact on the total wheat yield next year; summarizing and improving the yield-increasing technology of late-planted wheat is of great significance to increasing wheat production throughout the province.

Hebei farmers have accumulated rich experience in planting late-planted wheat. As the saying goes: "If the ginseng has not been harvested and the ground is not frozen, it can be planted with water and fertilizer." There are also many examples of high-yield late-planted wheat. For example, the 21.7 mu of Chinese cabbage stubble wheat planted by the Wheat Research Institute of the Provincial Academy of Agricultural Sciences was sown on November 25 last year, with an average yield of 604 jin per mu; the 30 mu of rice stubble wheat planted by the Agricultural Science Institute of Baigezhuang Farm was sown on November 15 last year, with an average yield of 531 jin per mu; the Wujiazhuang Production Team of Dongchangshou Commune in Xinle, sweet potato stubble wheat generally yields 440 jin per mu, cotton stubble wheat generally yields 380 jin per mu, and Chinese cabbage, radish, peanut, and other stubble wheat generally yields 420 jin per mu.

    Two Characteristics of Late-Planted Wheat

The pre-crops of late-planted wheat have a long growing season and mature late, so it has the following two characteristics:

    1. Insufficient Soil Nutrients and Moisture: The soil of late-planted wheat fields has a long growing season for the pre-crop and is harvested late, so the land fertility is greatly depleted; the land is vacated late, and it is necessary to rush to cultivate and sow, without time for leisure and sun exposure, and the land fertility cannot be restored and supplemented, so the land fertility is weak, especially the available nutrients are significantly reduced compared with wheat land or early-harvested and early-cultivated early stubble land. It also has an impact on soil moisture content. Generally, the later the pre-crop is harvested, the more soil moisture is consumed, and the lower the soil moisture content.

In response to the above characteristics, planting late-planted wheat must first strive for early harvesting and early land clearing, strengthen land preparation and fertilization, cultivate and rake as much as possible, apply more base fertilizer, apply high-quality fertilizer, and irrigate sufficient base water to ensure soil moisture and compensate for the lack of soil nutrients and moisture.

    2. Impact on Wheat Growth: Because the land is vacated late and the wheat is sown late, the growth and development of wheat seedlings are very different from those sown at the appropriate time. The main characteristics are small, weak, lacking, and late. However, late-planted wheat also has many high-yield characteristics that early-planted wheat does not have, such as: the weather is cold during the seedling stage, and there are few diseases and insect pests; the early growth is slow, and it generally will not grow excessively and lodge in the later stage, and large amounts of water and fertilizer can be used to promote its growth and development; tillering is late, tillering is not excessive, and the effective tillering rate is high, as long as the basic seedlings are sufficient, the number of ears required for high yield can be met; because the total number of stems is small, the shading is not large, the ventilation is good, and the sunlight is sufficient, so the plants are generally short and the stems are thick. Therefore, as long as we strengthen the fertilizer and water management of late-planted wheat, we can concentrate nutrients on effective ears, and we can obtain high yields with large ears, many grains, and heavy grains. According to the data from the "World's First Field" in Wurenqiao, Anguo County, although the tillering of late-sown wheat is only 700,000, it bears 522,000 ears, with a high ear formation rate and no lodging. Therefore, the number of grains per ear is eight more than that of early-sown wheat, and the thousand-grain weight is 5.7 grams higher, and the yield is comparable to that of wheat sown at the appropriate time.

    Measures to Grow Late-Planted Wheat Well

Summarizing the experience of planting late-planted wheat in various places, if we want to achieve increased production, we must grasp three key points: First, seize the time, harvest the autumn early, clear the stubble early, prepare the land early, and strive for early sowing. Second, improve the sowing quality, appropriately increase the sowing amount, carry out seed treatment, improve the emergence rate, protect wheat seedlings to overwinter safely, and achieve full and strong seedlings. Third, overcome the idea of ​​not paying attention to weak seedlings of late wheat and strengthen field management. Now the various measures are described as follows:

    I. Early Harvest, Early Land Clearing, and Early Land Preparation for Pre-crops, Striving for Early Sowing.

    (1) The quality of land preparation is related to the quality of sowing and the speed, quantity, and completeness of emergence, which directly affects the growth of seedlings and future yields. The emergence rate of late-sown wheat is generally low, and late-stubble wheat fields do not have time for leisure and sun exposure. They are generally hardened and cloudy, with many clods, which is not conducive to seed germination. If the land is not carefully prepared, the depth of the sown seeds is not easy to be consistent, and the seeds are not easy to be evenly distributed, and the emergence rate will be more affected. It takes time to cultivate and prepare the land well, and the sowing period is required to be advanced. The main way to solve this contradiction is to harvest the previous crop early and clear the land early to squeeze out time for land preparation.

Several major late-season crops in Hebei Province can be harvested early. According to research by the Shijiazhuang Meteorological Observatory and the Shijiazhuang Academy of Agricultural Sciences, the tubers stop growing when the soil temperature at a depth of 5 cm underground is 10 to 13 degrees Celsius. According to the harvest period test conducted by the Shijiazhuang Academy of Agricultural Sciences: After October 20, the tuber yield will no longer increase; and if sweet potatoes are exposed to temperatures below 9 degrees Celsius for too long, they will also suffer from cold damage and will not be resistant to storage. According to Hebei's meteorological laws, harvesting can begin in early and mid-October in the southern regions and in mid-October in the central and northern regions, striving to complete harvesting before October 20. This will not only have a small impact on sweet potato yields, but also free up time for wheat to carefully prepare the land and sow early. Cotton stops growing after the first killing frost. According to observations by the Shijiazhuang Meteorological Observatory and the Shijiazhuang Academy of Agricultural Sciences from 1955 to 1959, the earliest first killing frost occurred on October 15 and the latest on October 20. After the frost, the white flowers and green peaches can be harvested separately, and the cotton stalks can be removed for land preparation. Rice fields can stop watering early, which can promote maturity and reduce the groundwater level and soil temperature, making it easy for early harvesting, early plowing, and early planting. In short, we must consider the overall production situation and make appropriate arrangements for autumn harvesting and wheat planting. Even shortening the harvest period by one or two days and advancing the wheat planting period by one or two days will greatly help the growth and increased production of late-planted wheat.

    (2) In order to improve the quality of sowing and ensure that wheat is planted well, that every seed germinates, and that every bud emerges from the soil, land preparation should strive for large plowing and large raking, and multiple harrowing and fine harrowing, removing all residual stubble before plowing and raking, so as to make the land flat, the soil broken, and without clods. In order to save time and not delay land preparation, if the soil moisture is not good, cotton and leafy vegetable stubble can be irrigated before removing the stalks and vegetables to ensure that the soil moisture is moderate during land preparation, which is conducive to plowing and turning, and conducive to the germination and emergence of the sown seeds, and there will be one or two tillers before winter. In order to make up for the lack of soil nutrients, lack of sun exposure time, thin land fertility, and weak wheat seedling growth before winter in late stubble, more base fertilizer should be applied. The soil temperature is already low after late-stubble wheat is sown and emerges, and we cannot expect the fertilizer to rot and decompose in the ground, so we must apply high-quality rotten fertilizer or fine fertilizer. Applying five to ten jin of ammonium sulfate per mu mixed with seeds as seed fertilizer will have a better effect.

    (3) On the basis of early land clearing, early land preparation, and good land preparation, striving for early sowing and striving for seedling emergence and tillering before winter is the fundamental guarantee for late-stubble wheat to strive for a bumper harvest. Some late-sown wheat only germinate seeds before winter, and the seedlings do not emerge from the soil; or although the seedlings emerge from the soil in the same year, they emerge late, the seedlings are small and weak, the growth and development is not vigorous, and there is no tillering or very little tillering in the same year. According to investigations: if sowing is delayed until late November in Handan, Shijiazhuang, Baoding, Tianjin, etc., sowing is delayed until mid-November in Tangshan, and sowing is delayed until late October in Zhangjiakou and Chengde, seedlings will not emerge in the same year. In response to the above situation, all localities should seize the opportunity to sow early on the basis of early land clearing, early land preparation, and good land preparation.

    (4) Adopt a variety of sowing methods and strive to complete the wheat planting task early. In order to adapt to the characteristics of late stubble and strive to plant more wheat and sow early, the masses have also created many special wheat planting methods according to different stubble and the time of land clearing: intercropping, row planting, seedling transplanting, water-submerged seeds, "soil covering", etc. The first four methods can all seize the time to sow early; "soil covering" can also be used when the wheat planting task is large, there is a lot of land, there is little labor, the land clearing is too late, and it is really difficult to sow early. The specific methods are as follows:

Intercropping between rows of the previous crop: Suitable for vegetable stubble (such as Chinese cabbage, radish, turnip, etc.), it is best to choose flat planting. If it is Chinese cabbage stubble, you must first tie the cabbage to free up the row spacing, which is convenient for operation and can avoid yellow and weak stems and leaves of wheat seedlings due to shading after emergence. Before sowing, first deep-rake the row spacing, harrow finely, and then sow. Depending on the width of the row spacing of the previous crop, plant two to three rows of wheat in the row spacing. After harvesting the vegetables, it will become a banded pattern of two dense and one sparse or three dense and one sparse. This kind of sowing does not have to be too early. It is most appropriate for the wheat seedlings to just emerge or reach the three-leaf stage when the previous crop is harvested. Too early can easily cause the seedlings to be yellow and weak, which is not conducive to overwintering; too late, seedlings cannot emerge before winter or cannot tiller, and the growing season cannot be fully utilized. The sowing amount of row-planted wheat should be appropriately increased.

Plow-knife wheat: also called "plow-ditch wheat", is suitable for water-logged land or rice stubble with high water content, heavy soil, and where land cannot be prepared before winter. In low-lying areas where water drains late or after rice is harvested, plow-knife sowing is carried out without land preparation. The advantage is that it can seize the time to sow early; the disadvantage is that the soil is hardened, the permeability is poor, the seeds are densely packed in the plow ditch, the depth is uneven, the emergence rate is low, and the sowing width is too narrow. The remedy is: when the soil is slightly dry and the soil moisture is suitable, harrow the wheat to break the hardened layer and eliminate clods. At the same time, harrowing the wheat can loosen the sowing ditch and make the wheat seedlings grow strongly.

Seedling transplanting: Wheat seedling transplanting can solve the contradiction of late land clearing of the previous crop. This method can also be used to supplement seedlings in general wheat fields and eliminate missing seedlings in ridges. According to data from the Renqiu County Agricultural Experiment Station in 1959, transplanting can be done from "Frost's Descent" to "Awakening of Insects" in the second year, and the earlier the transplanting, the higher the yield. Although seedling transplanting can make up for the defects of late sowing and yield reduction of wheat, it is not convenient to promote it on a large scale because it is labor-intensive.

Water-submerged seeds: In order to seize the time and sow early, the masses in the Shijiazhuang area often adopt the practice of sowing first and then watering in late stubble land. The specific method is: after the previous crop is harvested, immediately plow the land and apply fertilizer, harrow finely, and sow first without flooding the land. After sowing, water, and when it is suitable for dry and wet, use a rake to rake and level (the masses call it back-raking) to wait for emergence. This can bring forward emergence by about five days compared to watering and preparing the land before sowing. However, it should be noted that this sowing method should not be used if the sowing period is too late. Because if it rains after watering, the wheat seedlings will not be able to be back-raked until they emerge, which will result in a hard and cracked surface that will not produce seedlings.

"Soil Covering": Sowing before the soil freezes in the first year, and emerging in early spring of the second year. This method of planting wheat is called "soil covering" by the masses in some areas. The Wheat Research Institute of the Hebei Academy of Agricultural Sciences used this method to plant 21.7 mu of wheat in the winter of 1959, and obtained an average yield of 604 jin per mu.

    II. Improving Sowing Quality and Increasing Sowing Amount are Powerful Measures to Improve the Emergence Rate and Achieve Full and Strong Seedlings. Late-stubble wheat is sown late, the soil temperature is low, the seeds germinate slowly, and emergence is late. The longer the seeds are buried, the more the moisture is sufficient and the temperature is insufficient, some of the seeds will be invaded by soil bacteria or self-mold and lose their germination ability. Therefore, late-sown wheat generally has a lower germination rate than early-sown wheat. Especially for "soil covering" wheat, sowing in the same year and emerging in the spring of the following year, the seeds need to be in the soil for more than three months, and the possibility of losing germination ability is greater, and the emergence rate is lower. Therefore, we must carefully select seeds, carry out seed treatment, and increase the sowing amount to ensure full and strong seedlings. According to statistics from 17 survey sites in Hucun, Fengjiazhuang Commune in Zhengding, Limingguan Commune in Yongnian, and Liyuting Village in Xinle, the minimum sowing amount per mu of late-stubble wheat is 25 jin, the maximum is 58 jin, and the average is 31.5 jin.

In order to improve the emergence rate of late-stubble wheat, in addition to the above-mentioned attention to land preparation and moisture retention, we should also appropriately treat the seeds to promote emergence and enhance germination potential. At the same time, late-stubble wheat has weak growth and development before winter due to late emergence, the plant tissue is tender, there is little accumulation of sugar in the body, and the resistance to cold and disasters is poor. We must take protective measures such as covering manure in winter, appropriately irrigating frozen water, and pressing wheat in winter and spring to ensure that the wheat seedlings overwinter safely.

　　提高晚茬麦的播种质量
　　河北省农业科学院
    种植冬麦，各地都有一个最适宜的播种期，掌握适期播种，可以提高单产。但在实际生产中，不可能所有麦田都集中在最适宜的几天里播完。河北省麦田面积较大，历年都有一些晚茬麦，一般约占全部麦田的四分之一左右，估计今年晚茬麦的比重将增加到三分之一左右。因此晚茬麦产量高低，对明年小麦总产量影响很大；总结并提高晚茬麦的增产技术，对全省小麦增产有着重要意义。
    河北农民对种晚茬麦积有丰富的经验，农谚说：“参不落，地不冻，有水有肥就能种。”晚茬麦丰产事例也很多。像省农业科学院小麦研究所种植的二十一点七亩白菜茬麦，去年11月25日播种，平均亩产六百零四斤；柏各庄农场农科所种植的三十亩稻茬麦，去年11月15日播种，平均亩产五百三十一斤；新乐东长寿公社吴家庄生产队，甘薯茬小麦一般亩产四百四十斤，棉花茬小麦一般亩产三百八十斤，白菜、萝卜、花生等茬的小麦一般亩产四百二十斤。
      晚茬麦的两个特点
    晚茬麦的前茬作物生长期长，成熟晚，因此有以下两个特点：
      1、土壤的养分水分不足：晚茬麦田的土壤，因前茬生长期长，收获晚，地力消耗较大；腾地迟，不得不抢耕抢种，无休闲晒茬时间，地力得不到恢复与补充，因此地力较弱，尤其是速效养分比留麦地或早收早耕的早茬地显著减少。对土壤含水率也有影响，一般是前茬收获越晚，消耗的土壤水分越多，土壤含水率越低。
    针对以上特点，种晚茬麦必须首先争取早收早腾地，加强整地施肥，尽可能大耕大串，多施基肥，施优质肥，灌足底水，确保墒情，以弥补土壤养分水分的不足。
      2、对小麦生育的影响：由于前茬腾地迟，小麦播的晚，因此麦苗的生长发育与适期播种的有许多不同，主要特点是小、弱、缺、晚。但晚茬麦也有早茬麦所不及的很多丰产特性，如：苗期天气已冷，病虫害少；前期生育迟缓，后期一般不会旺长倒伏，可以用大水大肥促其生长发育；分蘖晚，分蘖不致过多，有效分蘖率高，只要能保证基本苗足，可以满足丰产的穗数要求；因总茎数少，荫蔽不大，通风良好，光照较足，所以一般植株矮，而茎秆粗。因此，只要加强晚茬麦的肥水管理，就可把养分集中供应有效穗，可以得到穗大、粒多、粒重，而获得高产。据安国县伍仁桥“天下第一田”的资料，晚播的小麦分蘖虽只七十万，但结穗五十二万二千，成穗率高，不倒伏，因此每穗粒数较早播的多八粒，千粒重高五点七克，产量与适期播种的不相上下。
      种好晚茬麦的措施
    总结各地种晚茬麦的经验，要想实现增产，必须抓住三大关键：一是抢时间，早收秋，早腾茬，早整地，力争早播种。二是提高播种质量，适当加大播种量，进行种子处理，提高出苗率，保护麦苗安全越冬，实现苗全苗壮。三是克服对晚麦弱苗不重视的思想，加强田间管理。现在把各项措施分述如下：
    一、前茬早收获、早腾茬、早整地，力争早播。
      （1）整地好坏，关系着播种质量和出苗的快慢、多少、齐缺，直接影响幼苗的生长和将来的产量。晚播小麦的出苗率一般较低，而晚茬麦田没有休闲晒茬的时间，一般都板结发阴、坷垃多，这又不利于种子发芽。如不精细整地，播下的种子深浅不易一致，下籽不易均匀，出苗率将更受影响。土地耕好整细要时间，播种期又要求提前，解决这个矛盾的主要办法是前作早收获、早腾茬，挤出整地的时间来。
    河北省的几个主要晚茬作物是可以提早收获的。据石家庄气象台和石家庄农科所研究，甘薯田当地下五厘米处地温在摄氏十到十三度时薯块即停止生长。又据石家庄农科所作的收获期试验：10月20日以后，薯块产量即不再增加；而且甘薯在摄氏九度以下的温度时间过久，还会受冷害，不耐贮藏。按河北气象规律，在南部地区于10月上中旬，中北部地区在10月中旬即能开始收获，力争在10月20日以前收完，这样不但于甘薯产量影响不大，而对小麦则可挤出时间，细致整地，提前播种。棉花于第一次降枯霜后即停止生长。据石家庄气象台和石家庄农科所自1955至1959年五年的观测，第一次枯霜期最早之年在10月15日，最晚年份在10月20日，霜后可立即将白花及青桃分别收获，拔除棉秸整地。水稻田可提早停水，既可促进成熟，又可降低地下水位和土壤温度，便于早收、早耕、早种。总之，必须从生产全局着眼，把秋收和种麦作适当安排。即使把收获期缩短一、二天，把种麦期提早一、二天，对晚茬小麦的生长和增产都有很大帮助。
      （2）为了提高播种质量，保证小麦种好，粒粒发芽，芽芽出土，整地要力争大耕大串，多耙细耙，耕串以前除尽残茬，作到地平、土碎、没有坷垃。为了争取时间，不误整地，如墒情不好，棉花和叶菜茬可在拔秸拔菜前浇水淹地，保证整地时土壤干湿适中，便利耕翻，利于播下的种子发芽出土，冬前能有一到二个分蘖。为了弥补晚茬土壤养分少、无晒茬时间，地力薄和冬前麦苗生长弱的缺陷，要多施基肥。晚茬麦播种出苗后地温已低，不能指望肥料在地里腐熟分解，因此要施用质量好的腐熟肥料或细肥。每亩用五到十斤硫酸铵随种子混合播下，作为种肥，效果更好。
      （3）在早腾茬、早整地的基础上，力争早播种，力争冬前出苗分蘖，是晚茬麦争取丰收的根本保证。晚播小麦，有的在冬前种子只萌动，幼苗不出土；或幼苗虽在当年出土，但出土晚，苗小、苗弱，生长发育不旺，当年不分蘖或极少分蘖。据调查：邯郸、石家庄、保定、天津等地区迟至11月下旬播种，唐山地区迟至11月中旬播种，张家口、承德地区迟至10月下旬播种，当年就不能出苗。针对以上情况，各地应在早腾茬、早整地、整好地的基础上，抓紧时机提早播种。
      （4）采用多种播种方法，力争提早完成种麦任务。为了适应晚茬特点，争取多种麦，早播种，群众根据茬口不同和腾地早晚，还创造了许多特殊的种麦方法：间作套作、犁刀麦、育苗移栽、水淹籽、“土里摀”等。前四种方法都可以抢时间早播种；“土里摀”在种麦任务大、地多、劳力少、腾地过晚，早播实在有困难的情况下，也可以采用。具体方法如下：
    在前茬行间间作套作：适用于菜茬（如白菜、萝卜、蔓菁等），最好选平作的，如是白菜茬，要先绑菜，让出行间来，既便于操作，又可以避免小麦出苗后因荫蔽茎叶黄弱。播前先在行间深串一遍，打耙细碎，再行播种，视前茬行距宽窄，在行间套种小麦二到三行，收菜后即成二密一稀或三密一稀的带状样式。这样播种不必过早，以在前茬收割时麦苗刚刚出土或到三叶期最为合适。过早容易造成幼苗黄弱，不利越冬；过晚冬前不能出苗或不能分蘖，不能充分利用生长期。套播麦的播种量应适当加大。
    犁刀麦：也叫“犁沟麦”，适于含水量大，土质粘重，冬前不能整地的水脱地或水稻茬。在低洼地脱水晚或水稻收割后，不经整地，即用犁刀播种。优点是可以抢时间早播种；缺点是未经整地，土壤板结，通透性差，种子密集在犁沟内，深浅不一，出苗率低，播幅过窄。补救的办法是：土壤稍干墒情合适时即行压麦耙麦，以破除板结层，消除坷垃，同时耙麦可以松动播种沟，使麦苗健壮生长。
    育苗移栽：小麦育苗移栽可以解决前茬腾地晚的矛盾。也可用这方法，为一般麦田补苗，消灭缺苗断垅。据任丘县农业试验站1959年资料，从“霜降”到第二年“惊蛰”都可移栽，越早栽的产量越高。育苗移栽虽然可以弥补小麦晚播减产的缺陷，但因为费工多，不便大面积推行。
    水淹籽：石家庄地区群众为了抢时间、早播种，在晚茬地里常采用先播种后浇水的作法。具体作法是：前作收获后，马上耕地施肥，打耙细碎，不湮地就先播种，播后浇水，到干湿适合时，用耧挑背，耙平耙碎（群众叫回耙）以待出苗。这样比浇水整地后再播种可提早五天左右出苗。但应该注意，不是播期太晚，可以不用这种播种方法。因为在浇水以后如果遇雨，不等“回耙”麦苗出来了，就不能再回耙，结果会造成地表板硬、龟裂、不发苗。
      “土里摀”：第一年土壤封冻前播种，第二年早春出土，这种种麦方法，有些地区群众称之为“土里摀”。这种方法最适于棉花、白菜等收获特别晚的茬口采用。河北农科院小麦研究所1959年冬季曾用这种方法种麦二十一点七亩，获得平均亩产六百零四斤的产量。
    二、提高播种质量，加大播种量，是提高出苗率，实现苗全苗壮的有力措施。晚茬麦播种晚，地温低，种籽发芽慢，出苗迟。种籽埋藏的时间越久，水分够而温度不足，就会有一部分种籽受土壤细菌的侵袭或自行霉烂而丧失发芽力，因此晚播的小麦一般都比早播种的发芽率要低。尤其是种“土里摀”小麦，当年播种，次年春季才出苗，种籽在土里需经三个月以上，丧失发芽力的可能性就更多，出苗率更低。因此，必须精选种籽，进行种籽处理，加大播种量，才能保证苗全苗壮。据在正定丰家庄公社胡村、永年临洺关公社及新乐李玉亭村等十七处调查资料统计，晚茬麦每亩播种量最少的二十五斤，最多的五十八斤，平均为三十一斤半。
    为了提高晚茬麦的出苗率，除前述注意整地保墒外，还应该适当处理种籽促进出苗，增强发芽势。同时，晚茬麦由于出土晚，冬前生长发育弱，植株组织柔嫩，体内糖分积累的少，耐寒抗灾力差，必须采取冬季盖粪，适浇冻水，冬春压麦的保护措施，使麦苗安全越冬。
