　　A Red Banner for Small Blast Furnaces in Saving Coke
　  Jielong Iron Works Continuously Reduces Coke Ratio
    Averaging Just Over 700 Kilograms of Coke to Smelt One Furnace of Iron, Effectively Promoting High Yield and High Quality Pig Iron Throughout the Plant
    (Our newspaper, Chongqing, 23rd dispatch) The Sichuan Province Ba County Jielong Iron Works, focusing on conducting fuel conservation education for employees, fully utilizes coke, reduces the coke ratio, and for more than a year, has achieved 85% of coke entering the plant going into the furnace, and the coke entering the furnace has dropped from around 1,000 kilograms to around 700 kilograms per furnace of iron. From September of last year to August of this year, the average coke ratio for the year was 0.762 tons. The average coke ratio for the first half of September was 0.727 tons. The continuous reduction in the coke ratio has created conditions for high quality and high yield throughout the plant, making it a red banner on the iron smelting front in the province for saving coke.
    The Jielong Iron Works is one of the small-scale enterprises established during the Great Leap Forward in Steel in 1958. Since the beginning of 1959, the factory Party committee has regarded how to save coke and reduce the coke ratio as one of the most important keys to sustained and leaping production. In order to make the education of coke conservation penetrate the hearts of the people, the entire factory used various forms such as broadcasting, wall newspapers, symposiums, and discussions to make all employees fully aware of the importance of saving raw materials, fuel, especially coke, and breaking the superstitious idea of some employees that the coke ratio could not be continuously reduced. At the same time, by calculating detailed accounts, specific tasks for saving coke and reducing the coke ratio were assigned, and specific indicators and measures for saving coke were formulated from the workshop to the individual level. In the competition for increasing production and saving, saving coke and reducing the coke ratio were used as one of the important indicators of the competition, and the evaluation of classes and furnaces was adhered to. The entire factory was evaluated once a month, and the saving of coke and the reduction of the coke ratio were promptly commended and rewarded, so that the mass movement of saving coke formed a system.
    In saving coke and reducing the coke ratio, they firmly grasped two important links in saving coke: one is to reduce the waste rate before the coke enters the furnace; the other is to conscientiously implement technical regulations to ensure the normal production of the furnace. In reducing the waste rate before entering the furnace, they formulated specific measures for saving coke in all links from transportation, loading and unloading to crushing and use, and implemented a responsibility system. For example, in the transportation process, baskets are used to load and lift the coke up and down the car, lifting it gently and setting it down gently, avoiding the past situation of directly picking up and putting down the coke on the car, which caused a lot of coke to be smashed into debris. When crushing coke, the past method of breaking it with two hammers was changed to cutting along the grain with a special knife according to the grain of the coke, which greatly reduced the amount of coke fines. When using coke, the original habit was that the smallest coke block had to be fifteen millimeters before being put into the furnace, but now it has been changed to ten millimeters, and coke of thirty millimeters or more is used as grade one, and ten to thirty millimeters is used as grade two, and they are used in combination with each other, with the same good results. The remaining coke fines are also mixed with lime to make coke fines balls, which are put into the furnace according to a certain proportion. As a result, 85% of the coke entering the plant is fully utilized. The waste rate before entering the furnace has been reduced from more than 30% in the past to 15%. After entering the furnace, the focus is on improving the grade of the ore to achieve fine materials entering the furnace in order to reduce the coke ratio. To this end, during ore dressing, checkpoints are set up at each stage, and defenses are set up at each step. In the five links of ore collection, roasting, transportation, crushing, and entering the furnace, a combination of mass ore dressing and special personnel responsibility is implemented, so that the iron content of the ore entering the furnace is increased from 40% to 60%. After entering the furnace, the operating procedures are also conscientiously implemented, the technical management responsibility system is strictly enforced, and various measures are adopted to ensure that the furnace door does not freeze when the wind is stopped, and the furnace does not drop empty coke when the wind is stopped for three hours, which greatly saves coke and reduces the coke ratio.

### 小高炉节约焦炭的一面红旗  接龙铁厂焦比持续降低  平均七百多公斤焦炭炼一炉铁　有力促进全厂生铁高产优质

　　小高炉节约焦炭的一面红旗
　  接龙铁厂焦比持续降低
    平均七百多公斤焦炭炼一炉铁　有力促进全厂生铁高产优质
    本报重庆23日电　四川省巴县接龙铁厂，抓紧对职工进行节约燃料教育，充分利用焦炭，降低焦比，一年多来，做到入厂焦炭85％入炉，入炉焦炭由一千公斤左右降到七百公斤左右炼一炉铁。从去年9月到今年8月，一年来的焦比平均为零点七六二吨，今年9月上半月的焦比平均为零点七二七吨，由于焦比的持续降低，为全厂的优质高产创造了条件，成为全省炼铁战线上节约焦炭的一面红旗。
    接龙铁厂是1958年大办钢铁时建立起来的小洋群企业之一。从1959年初以来，厂党委即把如何节约焦炭，降低焦比，作为生产持续跃进的重要关键之一。为了使节约焦炭的教育深入人心，全厂通过广播、壁报、座谈、讨论等各种形式，使所有职工充分认识节约原料、燃料，特别是焦炭的重要意义，打破部分职工认为焦比不能持续降低的迷信思想。同时，通过算细账的办法，交代节约焦炭、降低焦比的具体任务，并从车间到个人层层订出节约焦炭的具体指标和措施。在增产节约对手赛中，都把节约焦炭、降低焦比作为竞赛的重要指标之一，并坚持了班班评比、炉炉评比，全厂一月一评，及时对节约焦炭、降低焦比的进行表扬和奖励，使节约焦炭的群众运动形成了制度。
    在节约焦炭降低焦比中，他们狠狠抓住了节约焦炭的两个重要环节：一个是降低焦炭入炉前的浪费率；另一个是认真贯彻技术规程，保证炉子正常生产。在降低入炉前的浪费率中，他们制订了从运输、装卸到破碎、使用等各个环节节约焦炭的具体措施，实行了责任制。如在运输过程中，采用上、下车用篓子装好抬上，轻放轻下，避免过去把焦炭直接挑上挑下汽车，使很多焦炭摔成碎屑的情况。在破碎焦炭时，把过去用二锤打碎的作法改为根据焦炭的纹路，用特制的刀顺着纹路砍下去，使焦炭的碎末大大减少。使用焦炭时，原来根据习惯焦块最小要十五米厘才放入炉，现在改为十米厘就入炉，把三十米厘以上作为一级，十到三十米厘作为二级，互相配搭使用，效果同样良好。余下的焦末，也和拌石灰作成焦末球，按一定比例入炉。这样作的结果，使入厂焦炭的85％得到充分利用。入炉前的浪费率由过去30％以上降为15％。在入炉后着重抓提高矿石品位，作到精料入炉，以降低焦比。为此，在选矿时，实行关关设卡，步步设防，在矿石的采集、焙烧、运输、破碎、入炉等五个环节中，实行群众性的选矿和专人负责相结合的作法，使入炉矿石含铁量由40％提高到60％。在入炉后，并认真执行操作规程，严格技术管理责任制度，采用种种措施，保证炉门在停风时不冻结，停风三小时不下空焦，大大节约了焦炭，降低了焦比。
