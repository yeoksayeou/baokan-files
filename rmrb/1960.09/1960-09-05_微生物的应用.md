The achievements of two closely related sciences—physics and chemistry—have had a tremendous impact on the development of modern microbiology, causing this science to change rapidly. Great progress has been made in using isotopes to study the physiological biochemistry and fermentation mechanisms of microorganisms. Considerable progress has also been made in studying the isotope exchange mechanisms and kinetics in microorganisms, and great achievements have been made in using isotopes to study the synthetic metabolic mechanisms of vitamins in microorganisms. Therefore, isotopes are already indispensable equipment in the laboratory and will soon be used as frequently as ordinary reagents. The use of microorganisms to explore for petroleum has achieved good results in the Soviet Union. Using microorganisms to prevent steel from rusting is no longer a strange thing, and a chemical substance has been extracted from mold that has been proven to be a highly effective rust inhibitor. Good results have also been achieved in preventing mold on electrical and telecommunications equipment. Similarly, microorganisms have also achieved significant effects in fiber products, plastics, bamboo and wood handicrafts, and coatings.

In the field of medical microbiology, researchers worldwide, including pathologists, biochemists, microbiologists, and other research workers, have invested great efforts in the study of malignant tumors, striving to solve the problem of prevention and treatment as soon as possible. Although it is still debated whether the occurrence of tumors is entirely caused by viruses, microbial workers have gained some experience in the study of tumors. The causes of influenza are also a problem that microbial workers urgently need to solve. We know that influenza is one of the most easily transmitted diseases, so it occupies a significant position in the work of prevention and control and health and epidemic prevention agencies. Research on Mycobacterium tuberculosis and epidemic hepatitis virus is being carried out on a large scale. The application of bacteriophages in medicine has made great progress. In the rescue of the steel warrior Qiu Cai Kang, bacteriophages defeated Pseudomonas aeruginosa, allowing Qiu Cai Kang to regain his health.

In the field of agricultural microbiology, the widespread use of rhizobium fertilizers, azotobacter fertilizers, potassium bacteria fertilizers, phosphorus bacteria fertilizers, and antibiotic fertilizers has greatly increased agricultural production. Azotobacter can not only be used as bacterial fertilizer but also can accelerate the development of pigs. Piglets fed dried azotobacter gain 17% more weight than the control group. The discovery of gibberellin has opened up new directions for the study of plant growth stimulants. Gibberellin is a highly unique substance with low dosage, wide application, and significant efficacy. It can promote the elongation of plant stems and leaves, promote flowering, break dormancy, promote seed germination, promote fruit setting, and promote rooting. Applying five grams of gibberellin per hectare is enough to obtain huge vegetable yields, and it can shorten plant growth from several months to several weeks. In addition, there are many bacteria in the soil that are beneficial to crops, such as ammonifying bacteria, which can convert organic matter into inorganic ammonia. Through the life activities of nitrifying bacteria, it is oxidized into nitrous acid and nitric acid. This action makes the nitrogenous substances in the soil easily absorbed by plant roots. Cellulose bacteria can turn large amounts of plant residues into a source of carbon in the soil. Sulfur bacteria can convert hydrogen sulfide produced after decomposition by putrefying bacteria into sulfuric acid, which then reacts with carbonates in the environment to produce sulfates that plants can absorb. Iron bacteria can convert iron compounds in the soil into iron that plants can absorb, and can also move iron from the center of the earth to its surface, changing the loose state of iron into a concentrated state, which determines the formation and exploitation of iron ore.

In the field of industrial microbiology, the putrefactive effect of bacteria is often used in the leather industry to remove hair and epidermal layers and make the leather soft and smooth. In the flax spinning industry, bacteria are often used to accelerate the decomposition of pectin in flax, thereby increasing the total yield of fiber and obtaining high-quality fiber. In terms of fermentation, microorganisms can ferment citric acid, acetone, ethyl acetate, sorbose, alcohol, casein, etc. Microorganisms also play an important role in the food industry, such as the manufacture of bread and canned food, and the storage of milk, milk powder, ice cream, etc. are all related to microorganisms. In addition, there is the fermentation of antibiotics. Successfully fermented antibiotics include aureomycin, streptomycin, tetracycline, chloramphenicol, neomycin, penicillin, polymyxin, violamycin, leucomycin, griseofulvin, terramycin, etc. Antibiotics can not only treat diseases of humans and livestock, but also prevent and control diseases and insect pests of fruit trees, vegetables, and crops, and prevent spoilage of fruit juice, eggs, cream, and vegetables. If livestock are injected with antibiotics before slaughter, it can prevent meat from spoiling; if poultry are fed with high concentrations of antibiotics, the eggs laid by the poultry can also be stored for a longer time. Feeding livestock and poultry with antibiotics can promote growth and development and reduce mortality. If calves are fed 24 milligrams of aureomycin daily, their weight increases by 12% compared with the control group. Feeding chicks with aureomycin increases their growth rate by half to one times compared with the control group. Similarly, feeding infants with 25 milligrams of aureomycin can increase their weight by 8% more than the control group in ten days.

In the field of microbial genetic variation, how to make microorganisms undergo directional variation and cultivate new strains needed by people is a major problem facing microbiologists. Currently, many microbial workers around the world are vigorously engaged in the selection and breeding of antibiotic strains and the search for new antibiotics.

The non-cellular life forms of microorganisms have not only attracted the attention of microbiologists but also the attention of general biologists. The theory that cells can only be produced from cells has been negated, and the existence of non-cellular lifestyles has been confirmed. The problem of non-cellular life forms of microorganisms is one of the most important problems in modern biology. The significance of this problem lies in the fact that it is related to the solution of many basic problems in biology, such as the origin of life, the possible forms of life, the origin of cells, and the development, variation, and formation of species of organisms. The existence of microbial filterable forms is of great significance in itself. It shows that bacterial cells can form living filterable forms under certain survival conditions, and bacterial cells can be regenerated from the filterable forms. Therefore, this proves the principle that cells may have evolved from non-cellular structural materials.

    微生物的应用
    胡乃宜
    在现代微生物学的发展中，两门相近的科学——物理学和化学的成就有着巨大的影响，因而使这门科学发生了日新月异的变化。用同位素研究微生物的生理生化和醱酵机制等问题，已经取得了很大的成就。研究微生物中同位素交换机制和动力学亦有相当进展，用同位素研究维生素对微生物的合成代谢机制也取得了很大成绩。因此，同位素已经是实验室不可缺少的设备，不久将会发展到如同使用一般试剂那样频繁的程度。用微生物勘探石油，在苏联已经取得了良好的效果。用微生物防止钢铁生锈，已经不是什么奇异的事，并且已经从霉菌内提取出一种化学物质，证实是高效的防锈剂。在电线电讯器材防霉问题上也取得了良好的结果。同样微生物在纤维制品、塑料、木竹制工艺品以及涂料等方面，也取得了显著的效果。
    在医用微生物方面，对于恶性肿瘤的研究，全世界的病理学者、生化学者、微生物学者以及其他研究工作者都投入了很大力量，力图尽快解决防治问题。虽然肿瘤的发生是否全部由病毒所引起还在争论，但微生物工作者对肿瘤的研究，已经取得了一些经验。流行性感冒的成因，也是微生物工作者迫切需要解决的问题。我们知道流行性感冒是最容易传染的一种疾病，因此在防治及卫生防疫机关工作中占显著的地位。结核杆菌和流行性肝炎病毒的研究正在大规模地进行。噬菌体在医学上的应用，已有了很大的进展。在抢救钢铁战士丘财康中，噬菌体战胜了绿脓杆菌，使丘财康恢复了健康。
    在农业微生物方面，根瘤肥料、固氮菌肥料、钾细菌肥料、磷细菌肥料以及抗生菌肥料的广泛应用，大大增加了农业产量。固氮菌不但可做细菌肥料，而且可加快猪的发育，仔猪加喂干燥固氮菌，比对照的重量增加17％。赤霉素的发现，为植物生长刺激素的研究开辟了新的方向。赤霉素是一种具有高度类型的物质，用量低，应用广，效能显著。它能促进植物茎叶伸长，促进开花，解除休眠，促进种子萌发，促进结实，促进生根。每公顷施用五克赤霉素就足以获得巨大的蔬菜产量，而且可以使植物生长从几个月缩短到几个星期。另外在土壤中还有许多有益于农作物的细菌，如氨化细菌，能把有机物变为无机态的氨，再经过硝化细菌的生命活动，氧化成亚硝酸和硝酸，这种作用使土壤中的氮素物质易于为植物根系吸收。纤维素细菌能把大量的植物残体变为土壤中碳素的泉源。硫细菌能把经腐败细菌分解后而产生的硫化氢转化成硫酸，硫酸再与环境中碳酸盐作用以产生植物可以吸收的硫酸盐。铁细菌可以把土壤中铁的化合物变为植物可以吸收的铁，同时亦可把地球中心的铁向其表面移动，把稀松的状态的铁变为浓缩状态的铁，这些作用决定着铁矿的形成与开采。
    在工业微生物方面，制革工业中常应用细菌的腐败作用，除去毛与表皮层，并使皮革柔软光滑。在麻纺工业中常用细菌加速麻类果胶质分解，从而提高纤维的总产量，并获得品质优良的纤维。在醱酵方面，微生物可以醱酵柠檬酸、丙酮、乙酸乙酯、山梨糖、酒精、酪蛋白等。微生物在食品工业中也起着重要的作用，如面包、罐头的制造，牛乳、奶粉、冰淇淋等的贮藏都与微生物有关。此外还有抗菌素的醱酵，现在已醱酵成功的有金霉素、链霉素、四圜素、氯霉素、新霉素、青霉素、多霉素、紫霉素、白霉素、灰霉素、土霉素等等。抗菌素不但能治疗人和家畜的疾病，还可防治果树、蔬菜、农作物的病虫害，防止果汁、蛋类、奶油、蔬菜的腐败。如果家畜在屠宰前注射抗菌素，则可以防止肉类败坏；如果用高浓度的抗菌素喂家禽，则家禽所下的蛋亦可保存较久。抗菌素喂家畜家禽可以促进生长发育，减少死亡率，如果小牛每天喂金霉素二十四毫克，比对照牛体重增加12％，用金霉素喂小鸡其生长速度比对照增加半倍到一倍，同样以金霉素二十五毫克喂婴儿可使婴儿在十天内体重比对照的增加8％。
    在微生物遗传变异方面，如何使微生物定向变异，培养出人们需要的新菌种，是微生物学者面临的重大问题。目前全世界许多微生物工作者都在大力从事抗菌素的菌种选育和寻找新抗菌素的工作。
    微生物的非细胞生命形态，不仅引起了微生物学家的注意，也引起了普通生物学家的重视。细胞只有从细胞产生的学说已经被否定了，而非细胞生活方式的存在已被证实。微生物的非细胞生命形态问题是现代生物学上极重要的问题之一，这一问题的意义是在于它关系到生物学上许多基本问题的解决，如生命的起源问题，生命存在的可能形态，细胞的起源问题，有机体的发育、变异及种的形成问题等。微生物滤过型的存在的事实本身就具有巨大的意义。它说明了细菌细胞在一定的生存条件下可以形成活的过滤型，从过滤型又能重新产生细菌细胞，因此，这一点证明了细胞可能从无细胞构造物质演发而来的原理。
