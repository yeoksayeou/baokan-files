　　Small Mine Aspires to Compete with Large Mine
　　——A Record of the Technical Transformation of the Jianyin Rock Small Coal Mine

On the coal industry front in Sichuan Province, there are thousands of small coal mines, like a scattered “militia” force, closely cooperating with the main force – modern large and medium-sized coal mines – to participate in the great battle of increasing steel production. This vital force, developed during the Great Leap Forward movement for mass steel production in 1958, which has made great contributions in the continuous two-year battle to increase steel production, is playing an increasingly significant role in the current new situation of high-speed leap forward in the steel industry; and it is constantly being transformed, developed, and strengthened. The Jianyin Rock Coal Mine in Guangyuan County, which we recently visited, is a red flag among these small coal mines.

The Jianyin Rock Coal Mine originally had only a few dilapidated small cave dwellings, using hammers and chisels for production, and relying entirely on human backs and shoulders for transportation. However, thanks to the workers' and masses' ambitious goal of "small mines competing with large mines, and indigenous mines surpassing foreign mines," they designed, constructed, and improved themselves while producing. In just half a year, they transformed a small coal mine with an annual output of over 100,000 tons into a large coal mine with an annual output of 600,000 tons. The spirit of self-reliance and hard work displayed by the workers of the Jianyin Rock Coal Mine is a vivid reflection of the soaring progress of thousands of small coal mines across the province.

　　Suggestions at the Mine Entrance Lead to High Yields

Whether small coal mines could achieve a "10,000-ton working face," that is, a working face producing 10,000 tons of coal per month, was initially a matter of debate among the leading cadres of the Jianyin Rock Coal Mine. Some believed that small coal mines have small working faces and narrow roadways, and therefore lack the conditions for a "10,000-ton working face." Others believed that conditions can be created, and the decisive factor is not material equipment, but the workers and masses. The Party Committee decided to hold a meeting at the mine entrance to hear the workers' opinions.

After careful analysis and heated discussion, everyone not only agreed to the idea of a "10,000-ton working face," but also put forward many specific methods. Some workers said: Our current working face is only one or two tens of meters long, accommodating very few people. As long as we enlarge the working face and increase the number of people on the front line, the output can be immediately doubled. Some workers said: The roadway is narrow, and underground transportation cannot keep up with production needs, affecting the output. If we widen the roadway and convert it all into wooden tracks and car transportation, the production of raw coal can take a great leap forward… Finally, everyone reached a consensus that small coal mines with simple equipment can still achieve a "10,000-ton working face," and the key lies in the technical transformation of the original old mine.

Through this debate, everyone saw the infinitely broad prospects of small coal mines. Their horizons were broadened, and their enthusiasm was even greater. Deputy Mine Manager Xu Junchen personally led workers, trekking through mountains and rivers, to learn from various brother coal mines. They learned not only from some small coal mines with better technical transformation, but also from some large coal mines with modern equipment and regular mining; they learned both "indigenous" and "foreign" methods. Then, they combined the "indigenous" and "foreign" methods and creatively promoted and applied them according to their specific circumstances. Based on the regular mining experience of large coal mines such as Nantong and Tianfu, they enlarged the working face from one or two tens of meters to six or seven tens of meters, and increased the labor force on each working face from two or three tens of people to over a hundred people, resulting in an immediate doubling of raw coal production. They learned from the experience of brother coal mines in Wangcang and Guangyuan in managing "roofs," adopting the method of dense props and slag filling, which not only ensured the safety of the working face, but also enabled the recovery and utilization of more than 80% of the pit wood. They also synthesized the experience of indigenous technical transformation from many small coal mines such as Qijiang Tongxing Coal Mine, and created and promoted mining methods and advanced tools such as "small-stage blasting coal falling" and "scraper coal extraction," which greatly improved production efficiency. In this way, in just over two months, they completed the technical transformation of the old mine and rapidly changed the face of production. Originally, a working face could only produce dozens of tons of coal per day, but after the transformation, it generally increased to more than one hundred to two hundred tons. The 601 working face, with the highest output, maintained a daily production level of 200 to 300 tons for several months, and the monthly output of thin coal seams reached more than 7,000 tons, achieving the requirements of a "10,000-ton working face."

　　“Black Gold” Rolls Down the Mountain

In the Wutiaogou mining area, more than a thousand meters above sea level, transport workers controlled teams of coal cars, running back and forth on the long flat track. At the steep slopes, without turning the cars or changing tracks, the workers hung the hooks on the steel wire rope onto the coal cars, and the coal cars, one after another, sent the coal down the mountain along the steep track line with a roaring sound. It took less than ten minutes to transport a car of coal over the distance of more than 1,700 meters from the mine entrance to the coal storage yard at the foot of the mountain. This is the mining area's transport linkage line that the miners designed, constructed, and installed themselves.

This transport linkage line, connected by flat tracks and downhill cable car tracks, was built entirely by the miners themselves, using local materials, except for a few steel wire ropes and flat iron provided by the state. They used bamboo strips instead of tape measures, cleared the way through thorns and thistles, and within a few days, they measured a reasonable and practical transport line on the overgrown hills; they used wood instead of steel, and used vises instead of lathes, overcoming various difficulties, and it took only more than a month to make more than three thousand meters of iron-wood track and hundreds of coal cars. "Indigenous engineers" such as ironworker Wang Peidi and carpenter Liu Shouxing innovated together, installing "automatic turntables" at the turning points of the track, making the cars turn flexibly and go back and forth freely. Young workers Chen Shunxi and Li Xingbang worked hard to create a soil winch with a mixed structure of iron, wood, and stone, so that the downhill cable car could run three or four coal cars at a time, greatly improving transportation efficiency. In this way, they spent less than two months and invested only a few thousand yuan to build this combination of indigenous and foreign transport linkage line.

The transport linkage line completely changed the face of transportation in the mining area, ensuring a steady flow of raw coal down the mountain. Originally, using human backs and shoulders, more than 400 people could only transport 120 to 130 tons of coal per day. Now, the number of transport workers has been reduced to more than 90, but the daily transport volume remains above 200 tons. The workers praised: The remote deep mountains of Jianyin Rock, high mountains and dangerous roads, few people; a great development of technical revolution, a great change in appearance in half a year; great contribution to ensuring steel with coal, black gold rolls down the mountain.

　　小矿立志赛大矿
　　——记拣银岩小煤窑技术改造经过
    在四川省煤炭工业战线上，有成千上万个小煤窑，好似一支分散活动的“民兵”队伍，正紧密地配合主力部队——现代化大中型煤矿，参加增产钢铁的大战斗。这支在1958年全民大办钢铁运动中发展起来的、曾经在连续两年增产钢铁战斗中立下过汗马功劳的生力军，在当前钢铁工业高速度跃进的新形势下，越来越显著地发挥着它的巨大作用；而它本身也在不断地进行着改造、发展和壮大。我们最近访问的广元县拣银岩煤矿，就是这样的小煤窑的一面红旗。
    拣银岩煤矿原来只有几座破破烂烂的小窑洞，生产上用的是二锤、?子，运输全靠人背肩挑。可是，由于职工群众立下“小矿赛大矿，土矿超洋矿”的雄心壮志，自己设计，自己施工，边生产、边改造、边提高，经过短短半年的时间，就将一个年产十多万吨的小煤窑改造成了年产六十万吨的大煤矿。拣银岩煤矿职工们的这种发愤图强、埋头苦干的精神，正是全省成千上万个小煤窑展翅高飞的一幅缩影。
        井口献计夺高产
    小煤窑能不能搞“万吨工作面”，即一个工作面月产一万吨煤，这在拣银岩煤矿的领导干部中间，最初是有过争论的。有人认为：小煤窑，工作面小，巷道窄，没有条件搞“万吨工作面”。有人认为：条件是可以创造的，起决定作用的不是物质设备，而是职工群众。党委决定到井口去开会，听听工人的意见。
    大家经过仔细分析和热烈讨论，不仅赞同搞“万吨工作面”，而且还提出了许多具体办法。有的工人说：我们现在的工作面只有一、二十米长，容纳的人很少，只要把工作面改大，多增加些人到第一线，产量就可以立即加番。有的工人说：巷道窄，井下运输跟不上生产需要，影响产量，如果把巷道加宽，全部搞成木轨道和车子运输，原煤生产就可以来个特大跃进……。最后，大家的认识一致了，设备简陋的小煤窑仍然可以搞“万吨工作面”，关键在于对原来的旧矿井进行技术改造。
    经过这场辩论，大家看到了小煤窑无限广阔的前途，眼界开阔了，劲头更大了。副矿长胥俊臣亲自带领工人，跋山涉水，到各个兄弟煤矿去学习经验。他们既到一些技术改造较好的小煤矿去学，也到一些拥有现代化设备、进行正规开采的大煤矿去学；既学“土”的，也学“洋”的。然后把“土”的和“洋”的结合起来，根据自己的具体情况，创造性地加以推广和运用。他们根据南桐、天府等大型煤矿的正规开采经验，把工作面由一、二十米改大到六、七十米，每个工作面的劳动力由二、三十人增加到一百多人，原煤产量立即成倍提高。他们学习了旺苍、广元等兄弟煤矿管理“顶棚”的经验，采取密集支柱和渣石充填的办法，不仅保证了工作面的安全，而且使80％以上的坑木都得到了回收利用。他们还综合了綦江同兴煤矿等许多小煤窑进行土法技术改造的经验，创造和推广了“小阶段爆破落煤”和“刮板出煤”等采煤方法和先进工具，大大提高了生产效率。这样，在短短两个多月中，便完成了对旧井的技术改造，迅速改变了生产面貌。原来一个工作面一天只能生产几十吨煤，改造后普遍提高到一百多吨到二百多吨。产量最高的601工作面，连续几个月都保持二百至三百吨的日产水平，薄煤层月产达到了七千多吨，实现了“万吨工作面”的要求。
        “乌金”滚滚送下山
    在拔海一千多米的五条沟矿区，运输工人们驾驭着一队队的煤车，在漫长的平车道上来回奔跑。陡坡处，既不转车，也不换道，工人们把钢丝绳上的钩子往煤车上一挂，一辆辆的煤车便沿着急转直下的轨道线，呼噜噜地把煤送下山去。在从井口到山下储煤场的一千七百多米距离中，运一车煤还用不到十分钟。这就是矿工们自己设计、自己施工、自己安装建成的矿区运输联动线。
    这条由平车道和下坡缆车道连接起来的运输联动线，除少数钢丝绳和扁铁是由国家拨给的外，全部工程都是由矿工们亲自动手、就地取材建成的。他们用篾条代替卷尺，披荆斩棘，几天内就在荒草丛生的山岗上测出了一条合理适用的运输线；又用木材代替钢材，用虎钳代替车床，克服各种困难，仅用一个多月时间就制成了长达三千多米的铁木轨道和成百辆煤车。铁工王培弟和木工刘寿星等“土工程师”，共谋革新，在轨道转弯的地方安上“自动转盘”，使车子转弯灵活，来去自如。青年工人陈顺西、李兴邦等刻苦钻研，创造了铁、木、石混合结构的土卷扬机，使下坡缆车一次就可以运行三、四个煤车，大大提高了运输效率。这样，他们一共花了不到两个月的时间和几千块钱投资，就建成了这条土洋结合的运输联动线。
    运输联动线彻底改变了矿区运输的面貌，保证了原煤源源下山。原来用人背肩挑，四百多人每天只能运一百二、三十吨煤，现在，运输工人减少到九十多人，每天运量却保持在二百吨以上。职工们赞颂道：冷落深山拣银岩，山高路险少人烟；技术革命大开展，半年面貌大改观；以煤保钢功劳大，乌金滚滚送下山。
