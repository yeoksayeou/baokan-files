    Upholding the policy of taking grain as the key link, reorganize mountainous area production.
    Jin Xing Commune doubles wheat planting area
    According to Xinhua News Agency, the Jinxing Commune in Xigou, Pingshun County, Shanxi Province, is carrying forward the revolutionary tradition of hard struggle and vigorous production of the old Taihang Mountain base area. It has organized its superior forces to go up the mountains and down to the beaches to reclaim all suitable cultivated land, and has expanded the wheat field planting area by more than double.
    In the discussion of increasing production and practicing economy, the members of the Jinxing Commune, in addition to proposing to strengthen the later-stage management of autumn fields and strive for more harvests, also generally requested to expand the autumn planting area to lay the foundation for more summer harvests next year. According to the mountainous terrain zoning, the commune party committee divided the twelve management districts of the commune into three areas. Each area, led by the secretary, absorbed the cadres of the management districts and production teams, as well as experienced farmers, herdsmen, and technicians, to form a survey and planning team. Based on the principle of combining long-term construction with current benefits, and taking grain as the key link, comprehensively arranging, and diversifying operations, a new study and deployment of land use in the mountainous area was conducted. It was decided to take four measures to expand the wheat field planting area. These measures are: First, for the original forest area, the "three-three" system will be adopted. In the first three years of forest land, intercropping of forest and grain will be implemented, with grain as the main focus, the land will be cultivated carefully, and the growth of young forests will be supported in combination with weeding and pest control; in the middle three years, intercropping of forest and medicinal (materials) will be implemented, with both forest and medicine being given equal importance; in the last three years, forestry will be the main focus, and other intercropped crops will be subordinate. Second, for some forest land with sparse young trees that has not yet been fully utilized, measures such as transplanting seedlings and afforestation and interspersing patches will be taken to open up land for wheat planting. Third, without affecting the development of animal husbandry, key pastoral areas will focus on animal husbandry and grazing, while general pastoral slopes will adopt a combination of agriculture and animal husbandry, and a portion of the abandoned farmland will be appropriately returned to cultivation and grazing suspended. Fourth, wasteland and barren slopes suitable for cultivation will be planned in a planned way and reclaimed for wheat planting.
    While planning, arranging, and acting simultaneously, a movement to expand cultivated land towards the gullies, mountains, and beaches quickly formed a climax in the commune. The commune mobilized 1,500 elite soldiers and 156 head of livestock to form 96 reclamation teams based on district teams. All commune cadres, led by Bai Ruilin, the secretary of the commune party committee, went deep into the front line to eat, live, work, and discuss with the members, and directed on-site. Li Shunda, a national agricultural labor model and director of the commune, led 13 shock team members, carrying luggage and cooking utensils, to the deep mountains of old Xigou, where he started mutual aid and cooperation, and has reclaimed 23 mu of wasteland and planted wheat. Shen Jilan, a national women's labor model and deputy director of the commune, led 13 female members in Dongyu Gully, adopting the method of mowing grass first and then plowing, and has expanded the wheat field by 25 mu. After more than a month of hard work, the commune has newly reclaimed 2,180 mu of wasteland and barren beaches in 88 gullies and more than 20 mountain tops, which is 1.2 times larger than the commune's original wheat field area. At present, the sowing of new and old wheat fields in the commune has passed more than half. Because the commune has focused on the quality of sowing, the quality of wheat sowing this year is generally good. The wheat planted in the newly reclaimed wasteland in Xigou Management District has emerged from the soil, and the seedlings are neat and even.

    贯彻以粮为纲方针　重新安排山区生产
　　金星公社种麦面积扩大一倍
    据新华社讯　山西省平顺县西沟金星公社，发扬太行山老根据地艰苦奋斗、大闹生产的革命传统，组织优势力量，上山下滩开垦一切宜耕地，已扩大麦田播种面积一倍多。
    金星公社的社员们，这次在讨论增产节约的计划中，除提出加强秋田后期管理，力争多收外，还普遍要求扩大秋种面积，为明年夏季多收打下基础。公社党委根据山区地势区划，把全社十二个管理区划分为三片，各片以书记挂帅，吸收管理区、生产队干部和老农、牧工、技术员参加，组成勘测规划小组，本着长远建设与当前收益相结合和以粮为纲、全面安排、多种经营的方针，对山区土地利用重新作了一次研究和部署。决定采取四项措施扩大麦田播种面积，这些措施是：第一、对原有林区，分别采取“三三”制办法，头三年林地，实行林粮间作，以粮为主，精耕土地，结合除草、治虫管理，扶植幼林成长；中间三年林药（材）间作，林药并举；后三年林业为主，其它间种作物则是从属。第二、对一部分幼林稀少，暂时还未充分利用的停耕林地，采取移苗迁林和插花并片的办法，开出种麦。第三、在不影响畜牧业发展的情况下，重点牧区以养畜放牧为主，一般牧坡采取农牧并举，把其中一部分弃耕地，适当还耕停牧。第四、有计划地规划零星宜耕荒坡荒地，开垦种麦。
    这个公社边规划边安排边行动，一个向沟向山向滩扩充耕地的运动在全社很快形成高潮。全社出动一千五百名精兵，一百五十六犋牲口，以区队为单位组成九十六个开垦队。以公社党委书记白汝霖为首的公社干部，全部深入第一线，与社员同吃同住同劳动同商量，现场指挥。全国农业劳动模范、公社主任李顺达带领着十三个突击手，背着行李、灶具，到他搞互助合作起家的老西沟深山里，已垦荒二十三亩，播种上了小麦。由全国妇女劳动模范、公社副主任申纪兰率领的十三名女社员，在东峪沟里采用先割草后犁耕，已扩大麦田二十五亩。经过一个多月奋战，全社在八十八个沟凹，二十多个山头，新垦荒地荒滩二千一百八十亩，比全社原有麦田面积扩大一点二倍。目前，全公社新老麦田播种已过大半。由于公社大抓播种质量，今年小麦播种质量普遍良好。西沟管理区在新垦荒地播种的小麦已经出土，麦苗整齐，均匀。
