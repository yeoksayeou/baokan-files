Xinhua News Agency, Washington, 8th: U.S. President Eisenhower, speaking at a press conference yesterday about the Cuban government's decision to establish diplomatic relations with China, openly threatened, saying that he "considered it a very serious mistake."

Eisenhower also discussed the situation in the Congo and the applications of two U.S. intelligence agency employees for asylum in the Soviet Union. Despite the fact that the United Nations' role as an accomplice in the Congo has been fully exposed, and its actions of sheltering colonialists, undermining Congolese sovereignty, and interfering in Congo's internal affairs have been repeatedly condemned by the Congolese government, Eisenhower still said that the "main responsibility" for the Congo issue still "rests with the United Nations."

Speaking about the applications of two U.S. intelligence agency employees for asylum in the Soviet Union, Eisenhower said that as the commander-in-chief of the U.S. armed forces, he was "more aware than others of the danger" that such events posed to the United States. He clamored that the United States should be "ever vigilant" and "very vigilant," and that it should strengthen espionage controls. He said, "We must thoroughly examine our entire procedure," mobilizing all kinds of American "organizations" and "groups" to investigate "the backgrounds and characters of people in sensitive positions."

    中古建交打击了美国统治集团
    艾森豪威尔公然威胁古巴
    新华社8日讯　华盛顿消息：美国总统艾森豪威尔昨天在记者招待会上谈到古巴政府决定同中国建立外交关系一事时，公然以威胁的口吻说，他“认为这是一个非常严重的错误”。
    艾森豪威尔还谈到刚果局势和美国情报机构的两个职员申请在苏联避难等问题。尽管联合国在刚果的帮凶面目已经暴露无遗，并且它的庇护殖民主义分子和破坏刚果主权、干涉刚果内政的行为一再受到刚果政府谴责，艾森豪威尔还是说什么在刚果问题上“主要责任”仍然“落在联合国身上”。
    在谈到美国情报机构的两个职员申请在苏联避难一事时，艾森豪威尔说，他作为美国武装部队的总司令，对这种事情对美国“造成的危险比别人更清楚”。他叫嚣美国要“永远警惕”和“非常警惕”，并且要加强特务控制。他说，“我们必须彻底研究一下我们的整个程序”，动员美国各式各样的“组织”和“团体”来调查“担任敏感职务的人的背景和性格”。
