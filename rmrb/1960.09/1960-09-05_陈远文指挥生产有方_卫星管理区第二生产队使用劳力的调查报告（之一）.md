Chen Yuanwen Directs Production Effectively: An Investigation Report on Labor Use in the Second Production Team of the Satellite Management Area (Part 1)
    Wu Sheng County Party Committee Correspondence Group, Our Newspaper Reporter

    Recently, during our visit to the Second Production Team of the Satellite Management Area in Jiuxian People's Commune, Wusheng County, Sichuan Province, we discovered that the team leader, Chen Yuanwen, is a good leader who is skilled at directing production.

    This team is located in the shallow hilly area along the Jialing River, mainly producing grain, with some cotton, sugarcane, and other cash crops. The team has a total of 206 mu of cultivated land, and currently, due to its vigorous efforts in increasing planting, intercropping, and relay cropping, the actual planting area has reached over 270 mu. They have also put a lot of effort into field management, and the area of high-yield fields has reached 30% according to high-standard inspections. The natural conditions and labor situation of this team are similar to those of other places, with 105 people from 48 households participating in labor. Due to the rational arrangement and use of these forces, not only are the current crops planted more extensively and growing well, but high-speed production increases have been achieved year after year.

    "The Ever-Victorious Magic Weapon"

    Knowing yourself and your enemy is the key to victory. This is the "eight-character classic" of military strategy since ancient times, and it is also the "magic weapon" that Chen Yuanwen has repeatedly used to lead the team to complete various tasks successfully.

    Chen Yuanwen is a Communist Party member and a demobilized soldier. When he was a soldier in the company, he often heard his superiors talk about the principle of "knowing yourself and your enemy is the key to victory," but he didn't feel it deeply because he hadn't led troops in battle. Since returning from demobilization and becoming the production team leader, he has understood the meaning of this sentence more deeply year by year. He said: "Governing nature is like governing the enemy. First, you must understand the other party's temper; second, you must verify and fully estimate your own strength. In this way, you can accurately see when and where to strike, whether with a fist or a kick. In short, when water comes, use earth to block it; when soldiers come, use generals to defend. Guarantee that the more effort you put in, the more harvest you will get." Initially, we didn't fully understand these words, but after living here for some time, we increasingly felt that his words had meaning and were reasonable.

    It was the end of the summer planting season, and it rained in the middle of the night. The commune Party committee immediately issued production instructions: "Seize the great opportunity after the rain to complete the planting of the three major crops (rice, sweet potatoes, sorghum) in one day." Under such circumstances, if we go all out to plant one thing and then plant another, we will lose sight of the other; if the planting manpower is divided into three groups, we will miss the planting opportunity for everything due to the shortage of manpower. Such a sudden concentration of farm work could easily overwhelm a novice, but Chen Yuanwen immediately convened a ten-minute meeting of work group leaders and commune members to analyze the "enemy situation": Sorghum is suitable for planting early in the morning, taking advantage of the moisture after the rain and the moist soil, without requiring much preparation before planting; sweet potatoes are suitable for planting in the late morning when the soil is slightly dry, requiring the preparation of ridges and the cutting of vines; rice is suitable for transplanting seedlings into warm water in the afternoon, requiring land preparation and fertilization. In response to this situation, they arranged the labor force: early in the morning, in addition to drawing a small number of commune members to cut vines and prepare ridges for planting sweet potatoes, they concentrated their efforts on planting sorghum; in the morning, in addition to drawing a small number of people to plow the fields and apply base fertilizer to prepare for transplanting rice, they concentrated their efforts on planting sweet potatoes; in the afternoon, they went all out to transplant rice seedlings. This arrangement not only met the growth requirements of the crops, but also greatly improved work efficiency by grasping current production on the one hand and preparing for the next stage of production on the other, seizing favorable opportunities and ensuring that the planting of the three major crops was completed on the second day.

    This team is located close to the Jialing River. During the summer planting season this year, the team decided to make full use of the open space along the river to plant more crops. However, the rise and fall of the Jialing River are as unpredictable as the autumn sky. Planting too much along the river would result in being submerged by the water, wasting manpower and resources in vain; planting too little would not fully utilize the open space. Later, Chen Yuanwen drew a line along the riverbank and led the masses to plant as much as possible within this line. Some elderly farmers believed that "this line is drawn too long and too risky"; some young people believed that "this line is drawn too close and too short." Whether it was too far or too close, we could see it clearly: during the peak flood season of the Jialing River in July and August, there were three rises and three falls, with one night seeing a surge of eight meters, but when it reached its highest water level this year, it still did not submerge the seedlings. We measured it, and the highest water level was only half a foot away from the line drawn by Chen Yuanwen. Why was this line drawn so accurately? After some inquiry, we learned that Chen Yuanwen had been observing the nature of the water every year and had figured out the temper of the Jialing River. Before going to draw this line, he had also consulted with many experienced farmers. After the line was drawn, he planted sorghum, corn, and other crops closest to the line, which would not be affected even if they encountered a little water. Chen Yuanwen, as people praised, is a "bold and meticulous" person.

    Chen Yuanwen not only pays attention to observing the temperament of crops, soil, weather, and the Jialing River, but he also pays close attention to grasping people's thoughts and personalities. When allocating labor, he always pays attention to comprehensively matching labor, technology, and ideology. The team members Tang Shuangquan and Hu Rencheng are both skilled eight-level laborers, but when the two of them plowed the fields together, they only plowed one mu per person per day. After Chen Yuanwen observed and understood these two people, he separated them and had each of them plow the fields with a young person with progressive thinking and relatively poor skills. As a result, each person plowed three mu per day. It turned out that Chen Yuanwen found that these two people were still competitive and wanted to show off their skills when working with people with slightly inferior skills.

    Several Tactics

    After generally understanding Chen Yuanwen's labor allocation situation, we were very interested in knowing what methods he often used to improve labor productivity. After many inquiries, we found that he often used the following tactics:

    "First, grasp the key. As long as you grasp the key and put the steel on the cutting edge, you can spend less effort and increase production." This is the first tactic Chen Yuanwen introduced to us. What he meant by grasping the key refers to important opportunities for increasing production, the central focus of farm work at each stage, and the important "junctures" in the growth of various crops. For example, in terms of the common "junctures" of various crops, Chen Yuanwen pays special attention to eliminating three types of seedlings before sowing. They did this during the summer harvest and planting season, and they will continue to do so during the autumn harvest and planting season. He presented us with the following facts: There was a three-mu "Tuotuo Field." After harvesting wheat in July of the lunar calendar the previous year, he immediately plowed the field, doing what the agricultural proverb says, "Plowing the field in July is like a bowl of oil"; he thoroughly eradicated borers in the winter; combined with six plowings and six harrowings, he heavily applied more than 8,000 jin of green manure, and when transplanting rice seedlings, he applied more than 12,000 jin of green manure. A total of twelve workdays were spent in the early stage, and with the labor used in the later stage, a total of twenty-two workdays were spent, with an average yield of more than 700 jin of grain per mu. Another "Wutiaogu" paddy field with the same conditions was plowed in September the previous year; borers were not controlled in the winter, and it only underwent four plowings and four harrowings, with a total of 5,000 jin of green manure applied as base fertilizer. A total of seven workdays were spent in the early stage, but more weeding was done twice, more borer control once, more fertilization twice, etc., totaling twenty-eight workdays, with a total of thirty-five workdays spent in the early and later stages, thirteen workdays more than the "Tuotuo Field," and the average yield was only more than 600 jin of grain per mu.

    Chen Yuanwen's second tactic is called "Double Insurance." When it was time to "weed key weeds," "water key water," and "apply key fertilizer" to late rice, corn, and sweet potatoes, Chen Yuanwen carefully checked the preparations of each work group the day before, including labor, fertilizer, and tools. It seemed that the preparations were quite complete, but Chen Yuanwen was not at ease. He continued to ask the work groups many questions: What if it rains and a small number of female commune members cannot work? What if the sun comes out and the slopes need more watering? And so on. He was only at ease after clarifying that each work group had made different arrangements to address several possible changes in objective conditions. He told us, "Without 'Double Insurance,' it is easy to fail to grasp the key."

    Chen Yuanwen's third tactic is "Grasping with Both Hands." While grasping current production, grasp the preparation for the next stage of production. The specific method is to squeeze out time or draw out a portion of the labor force while grasping current production, closely focusing on the needs of "grasping the key" and "double insurance" in the next stage, carry out material preparation, and strive to complete some of the general farm work of the next stage in advance.

    It is necessary to grasp the central farm work and take into account the general farm work, and it is necessary to prepare for normal situations and prepare for special situations. Needless to say, if it is not done well, it will cause farm work to "impede" and labor to be strained. We asked Chen Yuanwen and the cadres and commune members of this team how they solved these problems. This question revealed the last three tactics of Chen Yuanwen to ensure the realization of "grasping the key," "double insurance," and "grasping with both hands." These last three tactics are: "Two Sets of Work" (arranging two sets of farm work according to the time, people, place, and situation to ensure that everyone has appropriate work under various circumstances, grasping the preparation for the next stage when not grasping the current production, grasping the general farm work when not grasping the key farm work, etc.); "Cleaning Together" (doing this farm work while doing that farm work at the same time, such as tidying up ridges for sweet potatoes while sowing early corn; transporting while going to work and finishing work, etc.); "Five Goods, Two Reforms, Double Highs, and One Combination" (regularly evaluating the five good commune members who have good political thought, good labor production, good obedience to allocation and discipline, good care for public property, and good unity and mutual assistance; reforming tools, improving labor management; carrying out competitions for high work efficiency and high quality; implementing the combination of work and rest).

    Cleverly Deploying the "Five Autumns" Formation

    This time, we happened to catch the Second Production Team making a short arrangement for the "Five Autumns" (autumn harvest, autumn plowing, autumn planting, autumn management, autumn storage). This short arrangement was indeed very clever. On this day, Chen Yuanwen convened the work group leaders, team accountant, and activists to study and discuss the instructions of the commune and management area on the "Five Autumns" work. Afterwards, everyone analyzed the characteristics of this year's "Five Autumns." They said a lot in their own words, and Chen Yuanwen summarized them into five words: first, Big (the harvest volume of mid-season crops is large, and the labor used for rushing the harvest has increased by 25% compared with the same period last year); second, Many (late autumn crops are planted more extensively, and the area has increased by nearly two times compared with the same period last year); third, Tight (the "Five Autumns" are advancing simultaneously, and time is tight); fourth, High (the specifications and quality of various farm work are high); and fifth, Strong (strong timeliness and strong technicality). Therefore, the labor used for this year's "Five Autumns" has increased by more than 40% compared with the same period last year. This is the difficult side. But there is also a favorable side: mid-season rice is transplanted in three batches and matures in three batches, so the work is staggered. The maturity period of mid-season rice in each team is inconsistent, so they can support each other. More than 80% of the labor force has been invested in the agricultural front line, and so on.

    After analyzing the general situation of the subjective and objective, Chen Yuanwen's tactics were used to solve the contradiction between the large amount of farm work and the shortage of labor. He said: First, let's see what is key. From the perspective of the entire "Five Autumns" work, the harvest of mid-season rice is the key to current production. From the perspective of each aspect of harvesting, plowing, planting, managing, and storing, there are also keys. These "keys" are all farm work with strong timeliness and seasonality. Therefore, they take mid-season rice as the center, and according to the specific situation of mid-season rice maturing in three batches, divide the "Five Autumns" work into three small segments (each segment five to seven days), and distinguish which key farm work in each aspect of harvesting, plowing, planting, managing, and storing are included in each small segment in addition to harvesting mid-season rice. First, calculate the labor required for the key farm work in each small segment clearly, and take "double insurance" measures to ensure that it is done on time, with good quality, and in the required quantity.

    After calculating the labor required for the key farm work in each small segment, arrange a segment of farm work in each small segment. While focusing on grasping the key farm work and implementing "double insurance," make every effort to do a good job of the segment of farm work through the methods of "grasping with both hands," "two sets of work," and "cleaning together." For example, in the first segment, they focused on rushing to harvest "Tuotuo Huang," "Huangbian Nian," "Makeke" and other mid-season rice, combined with plowing fields, drying grass, and controlling borers in late rice; in the second segment, they focused on rushing to harvest the second batch of mid-season rice, combined with completing the task of plowing the field, harvesting rice straw, and planting late autumn; in the third segment, in addition to completing the third batch of mature mid-season rice, they vigorously rushed to plant late autumn crops, combined with completing the tasks of picking cotton, managing late autumn crops, and purchasing tasks.

    陈远文指挥生产有方
    卫星管理区第二生产队使用劳力的调查报告（之一）
    中共武胜县委通讯组　本报记者
    最近，我们在四川武胜县旧县公社卫星管理区第二生产队访问时，发现该队队长陈远文，是一位善于领导生产的好队长。
    这个队位于嘉陵江边的浅丘地带，主产粮食，兼种少数棉花、甘蔗等经济作物。全队共有二百零六亩耕地，目前由于狠抓增种、间种、套种，实际播种面积已达二百七十亩以上。他们在田间管理上也下了很深的功夫，按照高标准检查，高产田的面积达到30％。这个队的自然条件和劳力情况跟别处差不许多，全队四十八户社员有一百零五人参加劳动。由于合理安排使用了这些力量，不仅眼前的庄稼种的多、长的好，而且连年实现了高速度增产。
    “常胜法宝”
    知己知彼，百战百殆。这是自古以来兵家用兵的“八字经”，也是陈远文领导全队完成各项任务时屡战屡胜的“法宝”。
    陈远文是共产党员，是一个转业军人。当年在连队当兵时，他常听首长谈起“知己知彼，百战百殆”的道理，因为没有带兵打过仗，感受不深。自从转业回来，当了生产队长以后，他才一年比一年更深刻地懂得这句话的意义。他说：“整治老天，就像整治敌人一样，首先，要摸透对方的脾气；其次，要核实、估足自己的力量。这样，就能看准在什么时候，朝什么地方打它，用拳打或是用脚踢，总而言之，水来土掩、兵来将挡，保证多花一番功夫，就多得一番收成。”最初，我们对这几句话还领会不深，住了一些日子以后，越来越觉得他话有所指，言之有理。
    这是夏种收尾的时候，半夜落了一场雨，公社党委立即发出生产指示：“抓住雨后大好时机，三大作物（水稻、红薯、高粱）栽种一天完成”。在这种情况下，全力以赴，栽完了这样再种那样，就要顾此失彼了；种的人马分成三路，又会因人手太少，样样错过栽种时机。像这样突然发生的农活集中现象，对于一个新手很可能不知所措，但陈远文马上召集作业组长和社员开了十分钟的碰头会，分析了“敌情”：高粱，适宜乘雨后潮气未散，土壤湿润时候，一大早就栽，栽前也不需要较多的准备工作；红薯，适宜在雨后土壤稍干的上午时候栽，栽前需要刨好厢、割好藤；水稻，则适宜下午栽温水秧，栽前需要整地、施肥。针对这一情况，他们安排了劳力：一大早，除抽少数社员割藤、刨厢进行栽薯准备外，集中力量种高粱；上午除抽少数人犁田、施底肥进行插秧准备外，集中力量栽红薯；下午则全力给水稻插秧。这样一安排，不仅适应作物生长的要求，而且由于一手抓当前生产、一手抓下一步生产准备，大大提高了工效，抓住了有利时机，保证三大作物的栽种在第二天全部完成。
    这个队紧靠嘉陵江。今年夏种时候，队上决定充分利用江边的空地，多种一些作物。可是嘉陵江水的涨落，却像秋天的天空一样多变莫测。在江边种的过多，就会被水淹没，白白浪费了人力和物力；种的过少，就不能充分利用空地。后来，陈远文在江边划了一条线，领导群众在这条线以内尽量地种。个别老农认为“这条线划的太长，太险”；个别青年人认为“这条线划的太近，太短”。到底是太远还是太近，我们看得清清楚楚：嘉陵江在7、8月最大的洪水期中，三涨三落，有一夜激增八米，但是当它达到今年的最高水位时，仍然没淹到株苗。我们量了量，最高水位距离陈远文划的这条线，只有半尺多远。为什么这条线划的这样准确？仔细一打听，才知道陈远文年年观察水性，摸住了嘉陵江的脾气。临去划这条线之前，他又跟很多有经验的农民商量过。划了线之后，又在最靠近这条线的地方种的是高粱、玉米等，即使遇到一点水也不妨事。陈远文正如人们称道的是一个“胆大心细”的人。
    陈远文不光留心观察作物、土壤、天气、嘉陵江的脾气，他还十分注意掌握人的思想、性情。调配劳力时，一直注意全面搭配好劳力、技术和思想。这个队的社员唐双全和胡仁成，都是技术熟练的八级劳动力，但他两个一道犁田，每天每人只犁一亩。陈远文对这两个人作了一番观察了解之后，就将他两分开，各与一个思想进步、技术较差的年青人同道犁田。结果每人每天犁三亩。原来，陈远文发现这两个人还是要强好胜的，要让他们跟技术稍差的人一道干活，那就非要露两手不可。
    几条战术
    一般地了解到陈远文调配劳力的情况后，我们很想知道，他经常运用什么办法来提高劳动生产率的。经过多次了解，我们发现他经常运用的有以下几条战术：
    “首先抓关键，只要抓住关键，把钢火加在刀口上，就能少花工、多增产”。这是陈远文向我们介绍的第一条战术。他所说的抓关键，指的是增产的重要时机，各阶段的农活中心，各项作物生长的重要“关口”。比如，就各项作物共同的“关口”来说，陈远文特别注意把三类苗消灭在播种之前。他们在夏收夏种时这么做了，秋收秋种还要这么做。他给我们摆出了下面的事实：有一块三亩大的“沱沱田”，前一年农历7月割麦后，马上犁田，做到农谚说的“7月犁田一碗油”；冬季彻底扑灭了螟虫；结合六犁六耙重施八千多斤青肥，栽秧时又施了一万二千多斤青肥。前期共花了十二个工，加上后期用工，总共用工二十二个，平均亩产七百多斤谷子。而另一块条件相同的“五挑谷”稻田，是前年9月犁田；冬季没有治螟，只经过四犁四耙，底肥总共施了五千斤青肥。前期共花工七个，但后期多除草两次，多治螟一次，多施肥两次等，共花工二十八个，前后期总共用工三十五个，比“沱沱田”多花十三个工，平均亩产只有六百多斤谷子。
    陈远文的第二条战术叫“双保险”。那是到了给晚稻、玉米、红薯分别“锄关键草”、“浇关键水”、“施关键肥”的时候，陈远文在前一天便仔细检查了各个作业小组的劳力、肥料、工具等准备工作。看来这个准备是相当齐全的，但是陈远文并不放心，他继续向各个作业组提出很多问题：要是落了雨，少数女社员不能出工怎么办？要是出了太阳，坡地需要多浇水怎么办？等等。直到问明各个作业组，针对客观情况可能发生的几种变化，已作好不同的安排后才算放心。他告诉我们，“双保险，没有这一条，抓关键就容易落空”。
    陈远文的第三条战术是“两手抓”。在抓好当前生产的同时，抓好下一步生产的准备。具体作法是，在抓当前生产的同时，挤出时间或抽出一部分劳力，紧紧围绕着下阶段“抓关键”、“双保险”的需要，进行物质准备，并争取将下阶段的一部分一般农活提前作完。
    既要抓中心农活，又要兼顾一般农活，既要按正常情况作好准备，又要作好特殊情况的准备，不用说，弄不好就会造成农活“顶牛”、劳力紧张。我们曾向陈远文以及这个队的干部和社员，问起他们是怎样解决这些问题的。经这一问，便问出了陈远文保证实现“抓关键”、“双保险”、“两手抓”的后三条战术。这后三条战术是：“两套活”（因时因人因地因情况安排两套农活，保证在各种情况下，人人都有适当工作，不抓上步生产就抓下步准备，不抓关键农活就抓一般农活等）；“一道清”（作这样农活时，稍带做好那样农活，如播种早玉米时，稍带给红薯理厢；出工收工稍带运输等）；“五好两改双高一结合”（经常评选政治思想好、劳动生产好、服从调配遵守纪律好、爱护公共财物好、团结互助好的五好社员；改革工具、改善劳动管理；开展高工效、质量高的竞赛；贯彻劳逸结合）。
    巧布“五秋”阵
    这次正碰上第二生产队进行“五秋”（秋收、秋耕、秋种、秋管、秋藏）的短安排。这个短安排着实搞的很巧。这天，陈远文召集作业组长、队会计、积极分子，学习讨论了公社、管理区有关“五秋”工作的指示。随后大家分析了今年“五秋”的特点，你言他语地说了很多，陈远文归纳起来，共有五个字：一是大（中熟作物收获量大，抢收用工比去年同期增加25％）；二是多（晚秋作物种得多、面积比去年同期增加近两倍）；三是紧（“五秋”齐头并进，时间紧）；四是高（各项农活规格质量高）；五是强（时间性强，技术性强）。因此，今年“五秋”用工量比去年同期增加40％以上。这是困难的一面。但也有有利的一面：中稻是分三批栽插、三批成熟，活路错得开，各队中稻成熟期不一致，可以相互支援，已有80％以上的劳力投入农业第一线，等等。
    分析了主客观的大体情况后，为了解决农活多、劳力少的矛盾，陈远文的战术就用上了。他说：先看看啥子是关键。从整个“五秋”工作来看，中稻收割是当前生产的关键。从收、耕、种、管、藏的每一方面来看，也各有关键。这“关键”，都是一些时间性、季节性强烈的农活。于是他们便以中稻为中心，根据中稻分三批成熟的具体情况，将“五秋”工作分成三个小段（每段五至七天），分清每一小段除了收获中稻以外，还包括收、耕、种、管、藏各方面的那些关键农活，先将每一小段关键农活的需工量计算清楚，采取“双保险”的办法保证按时、按质、按量作好。
    算出每一个小段关键农活的需工量之后，便将一段农活安插在各个小段之中。在集中抓关键农活，实行“双保险”的同时，通过“两手抓”“两套活”、“一道清”等办法，尽量将一段农活捎带作好。例如，他们在第一个小段，以抢收“沱沱黄”、“黄边粘”、“麻壳壳”等中稻为主，结合进行犁田、晒草、晚稻治螟等工作；第二小段以抢收第二批中稻为主，结合完成耕板田、收谷草、种晚秋等任务；第三小段除完成第三批成熟的中稻外，大力抢种晚秋作物，结合完成收摘棉花，管理晚秋作物，以及征购任务等工作。
