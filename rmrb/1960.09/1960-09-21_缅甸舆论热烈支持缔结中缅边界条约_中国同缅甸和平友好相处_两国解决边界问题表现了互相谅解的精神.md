Xinhua News Agency, Rangoon, September 19th: The Burmese "Rangoon Daily" published an editorial today on the Sino-Burmese boundary issue, stating: "The smooth resolution of the demarcation of the Sino-Burmese border is the result of the spirit of understanding demonstrated by both countries." The editorial said, "This is an example that every country should emulate when resolving all disputes."

The editorial emphasized: The People's Republic of China has shown the world that its sole purpose is to live peacefully and amicably with its neighbors—whether they are small or large, weak or strong. This matter also shows that Burma believes in the principle of peaceful coexistence in its relations with its neighbors.

The editorial stated that there may be other countries in the world with similar boundary issues awaiting resolution. The editorial believes that if these countries can handle the issues in the spirit of understanding and the principle of peaceful coexistence, as the Chinese and Burmese governments have resolved the Sino-Burmese boundary issue, their boundary issues can also be resolved.

The newspaper then pointed out, "After the demarcation work is completed, permanent measures must be taken to continue to improve the relationship between the governments and peoples of China and Burma."

Xinhua News Agency, Rangoon, September 19th: Burmese public opinion warmly welcomes and supports the final conclusion of the Sino-Burmese Boundary Treaty this October.

The "Vanguard" published an editorial on the 18th calling on all Burmese people to support the Sino-Burmese Boundary Treaty with cheers. The editorial said that the boundary agreement signed between China and Burma "is completely just and fair."

The newspaper said: In the process of resolving the boundary issue, China and Burma did not stubbornly or unilaterally insist on historical records, but resolved the issue based on the current situation of the Sino-Burmese border in a spirit of mutual understanding and equality.

The newspaper emphasized: In resolving territorial issues with differing opinions, the two countries conducted consultations on an equal footing. The newspaper said that in the past, there had never been a case of a large country and a small country conducting such consultations on an equal footing.

The newspaper also said, "If this major issue remains unresolved, those who attempt to create misunderstandings between China and Burma and further escalate international tensions will have an opportunity to exploit." The newspaper pointed out: "However, it is now extremely difficult to succeed in hindering and undermining Sino-Burmese friendship and peace."

The All-Burma Students' Union and the Rangoon University Student Union issued statements on September 17th respectively, warmly welcoming and supporting the signing of the Sino-Burmese Boundary Treaty in Beijing on October 1st.

　　缅甸舆论热烈支持缔结中缅边界条约
　　中国同缅甸和平友好相处
　　两国解决边界问题表现了互相谅解的精神
　　新华社仰光19日电　缅甸“仰光日报”今天就中缅边界问题发表社论说：“中缅边界的标界的顺利解决，是两国所表现的谅解精神的结果。”社论说，“这是每一个国家在解决一切争端时所应该效法的榜样”。
    社论强调说：中华人民共和国已向世界表明，它的唯一目的，是同它的邻国——不论它们是小国还是大国、是弱国还是强国——和平地和友好地共处。这件事情还表明缅甸在同它的各邻国的关系上，相信和平共处的原则。
    社论说，世界上可能有其它国家也有类似的边界问题有待解决。社论认为，如果这些国家能够像中缅两国政府解决中缅边界问题那样，根据谅解的精神和和平共处的原则来处理问题，那么，它们之间的边界问题也同样能够获得解决。
    这家报纸接着指出，“在完成标定边界的工作以后，必须采取永久性的措施来继续改善中国和缅甸两国政府和人民之间的关系。”
    新华社仰光19日电　缅甸舆论热烈欢迎和支持在今年10月最后缔结中缅边界条约。
      “先锋报”18日发表社论号召全体缅甸人民以欢呼的心情来支持中缅边界条约。社论说，中国和缅甸之间签订的边界协定“是完全公正和公平的”。
    这家报纸说：在解决边界问题的过程中，中国和缅甸没有固执地或片面地坚持历史记录，它们在互相谅解和平等的基础上，按照中缅边界目前的情况解决了问题。
    这家报纸强调指出：在解决有分歧意见的领土问题时，两国在平等的基础上进行了商谈。报纸说，在过去，从来没有一个大国和一个小国之间会在平等的基础上进行这种商谈的事情。
    这家报纸又说，“如果这个重大问题仍然悬而不得最后解决，企图在中国和缅甸之间制造误解和进一步加剧国际紧张局势的人们就将有隙可乘”。这家报纸指出：“可是，现在要来妨碍和破坏中缅友谊和和平已经极难得逞了”。
    全缅学生联合会和仰光大学学生会，在9月17日分别发表了声明，热烈欢迎和支持于10月1日在北京签订中缅边界条约。
