Chongqing, September 27th, this newspaper reports: In the Chongqing Iron and Steel Company's No. 1 Open Hearth Furnace Workshop, 190 Communist Party members, in the movement to increase production and practice economy, put forward ten measures to the Party targeting the plant's main production bottlenecks, and launched a heated campaign to tackle key problems centered on the implementation of these ten measures. Their exemplary behavior led all the workers in the plant to quickly break through the three major bottlenecks of smelting time, high sulfur content in pig iron, and insufficient gas production, and achieve high production and high quality.

Since the launch of the movement to increase production and practice economy, the 190 Communist Party members of the Chongqing Iron and Steel Plant's No. 1 Open Hearth Furnace Workshop, in order to achieve high quality and high yield, have put forward ten measures. The Party Committee of the No. 1 Open Hearth Furnace Workshop, in order to concretize the ten measures and better guarantee the completion and over-fulfillment of the production increase and economy plan, called on all Party members to unite the masses, offer suggestions and strategies, and quickly break through the three major key problems in production: long smelting time, high sulfur content in pig iron, and insufficient gas production, in order to further shorten the smelting time. After the Party members clarified the main direction of attack, they took the ten measures as a program of action and launched a movement in which each person contributed a plan and each group tackled a key problem. Each Party branch and each Party group, focusing on the three major key problems, found the specific key problems and specific tackling measures for their production posts, and surrounded and attacked the "three passes" from all links of steelmaking production. For example, sulfur removal is a major key, but around sulfur removal, there are still many small keys. Who attacks what, and what method to use to attack, are specifically implemented to each Party group and each Party member, contracted by Party members, and lead the masses to break through various production keys.

Adopting this method of Party members contracting to tackle key problems has greater power than any previous tackling movement, and therefore brings more significant results to production. First of all, the most outstanding members of the workers' ranks—the Communist Party members—are concentrated in the most critical places of production. Insufficient gas production is one of the old key problems that cause long smelting times in this plant. This time, Wu Ruliang, the Deputy Party Secretary who came from an old gas worker background, proposed to the Party that he must burn the gas well and went deep into the gas furnace section to experiment in the "experimental field." He carefully observed in front of the furnace all day, operated with the workers, and investigated the reasons for the insufficient gas production. Once, he found that a long section of the coal raking rod was burned red, and he quickly opened the lid of the punching hole, only to see red flames and billowing smoke rushing upwards, and coal lumps as big as fists being blown upwards by the blower. Wu Ruliang now had a bottom line in his heart and immediately convened a meeting of foremen and squad leaders to discuss the reasons why the gas was not burning well. Some squad leaders said that the fire in the furnace was very strong, and the workers were very motivated, but the steelmaking furnace still had to wait for temperature. Wu Ruliang nodded and said, "The comrades' enthusiasm is indeed not small, but they have not grasped the key. If you open the air volume so much, the gas will become waste gas. You have put in a lot of effort here, but the open hearth furnace still has no gas." After everyone found out the reason, they immediately reduced the air volume. Later, a tackling team was established, personally directed by Wu Ruliang, to absorb the advanced operating techniques of the workers and summarize a complete set of experiences of "one ventilation," "two goods" (good gas quantity, good coal bed temperature), and "three no-caking" (no-caking of slag, no-caking of condensate, no-caking of edges), and promptly incorporated it into the operating regulations. After the gas furnace workers implemented the new operating methods, the average heating value of the gas in the latter ten days compared with the former ten days increased by 40 kcal, basically eliminating the phenomenon of waiting for temperature in front of the furnace. The actions of Secretary Wu Ruliang motivated the remaining Party member cadres. The branch secretaries of the gas furnace and iron melting furnace sections went to the furnace front to work and contracted to surround and attack the specific keys of each furnace, so that many key problems were readily solved.

The method of Party members contracting to tackle key problems can also give fuller play to the core leadership role of the Party organization and further stimulate the production enthusiasm of the broad masses of workers. On the one hand, Party members must take the mass line and rely on the masses to work together in order to overcome production bottlenecks; on the other hand, the masses see that Party members take the lead everywhere and are willing to consciously participate in the tackling movement. This has set off a new situation in the whole plant in which one horse takes the lead and ten thousand horses gallop. When Communist Party member and veteran steelmaker Huang Shaorong was on duty, he would promptly convene an enlarged meeting of the furnace-side Party group (he is the Party group leader and deputy squad leader) to raise problems, discuss them with everyone, and mobilize the masses to solve them together. Once, the smelting time of the previous shift was prolonged, so he held a furnace-side meeting when taking over the shift, and proposed that the shift resolutely implement high-temperature operation, rapid steelmaking, shorten the smelting time, and make up for the "arrears" (ie, the unfinished tasks) of the previous shift. Because he usually cares about the thoughts and lives of the masses and can take the lead in working hard, his proposal was quickly responded to by all the workers in the furnace. On that day, they indeed created a new record for the shortest refining period and shortened the smelting time for a furnace of steel left by the previous shift. Because the Communist Party members of the smelting team paid attention to fully relying on the masses in contracting to overcome smelting bottlenecks, they summarized a set of advanced operating experiences of first releasing, releasing more, and releasing initial slag frequently, adding less and adding limestone frequently, and maintaining high-temperature boiling in the furnace, based on the smelting policy of adhering to more loading, rapid smelting, high temperature, and longevity, and according to the situation of higher sulfur content in molten iron. After the smelting workers promoted this set of advanced operating methods, comparing the latter ten days with the former ten days, the time to smelt a furnace of steel was shortened by an average of 2.15 minutes, among which many furnaces broke the eight-hour mark, and on September 8, they created a new record of smelting a furnace of steel in seven hours and twenty-three minutes. The Communist Party members of the iron melting furnace section and the masses together promoted and created a total of sixteen advanced experiences in desulfurization, increasing the average desulfurization efficiency to more than 48%, ensuring that high-sulfur molten iron does not enter the open hearth furnace, and creating good conditions for the open hearth furnace to produce more steel and high-quality steel.

　　团结群众  依靠群众  实现优质高产
　　重钢平炉一厂共产党员带头攻关
    本报重庆27日电　重庆钢铁公司平炉一厂一百九十名共产党员，在增产节约运动中，针对厂里的主要生产关键，向党提出十大措施，并以实现十大措施为中心，热烈开展攻关大竞赛。他们的模范行为，带动全厂职工迅速突破了冶炼时间、生铁含硫高、煤气发生量不足等三大关键，实现了高产优质。
    开展增产节约运动以来，重钢平炉一厂一百九十名共产党员为了实现优质高产，曾提出了十大措施。平炉一厂党委，为了把十大措施具体化，更好地保证完成和超额完成增产节约计划，便号召全体党员团结群众，献策献计，迅速突破生产上冶炼时间长、生铁含硫率高和煤气发生量不足等三大主要关键，以便进一步缩短冶炼时间。全体党员明确了主攻方向，便以十项措施为行动纲领，开展一个一人献一计、一组攻一关的运动。各党支部，各党小组，都围绕三大关键找出自己生产岗位的具体关键和具体攻关措施，从炼钢生产的各个环节上围攻“三关”。例如攻硫是一大关，但围绕着攻硫，还有许多小关，谁攻什么，用什么方法攻都具体落实到每一个党小组和每一个党员，由党员包干，带领群众突破各种生产关键。
    采取这种党员包干攻关的办法，比过去任何一次攻关运动的威力都大，因此给生产带来的效果更显著。首先把工人队伍中最优秀的分子——共产党员，都集中到生产最关键的地方上去。煤气发生量不足，是这个厂冶炼时间长的老关键之一。这次，老煤气工人出身的党委副书记吴如良，向党提出一定要把煤气烧好的措施，深入到煤气炉工段种试验田。他成天在炉前仔细观察，和工人一起操作，调查研究煤气发生量不足的原因。一次，他发现拨煤的钎子很长一截都被烧得通红，连忙打开打钎孔的盖子，只见红红的火苗，黄滚滚的浓烟直往上冲，拳头大的煤块也被鼓风机吹得直往上跳。吴如良这下心里有了底，立即召开了一个工长和班长会议，让大家来座谈煤气为什么烧不好的原因。有的班长说，炉内的火旺得很，工人干劲也大得很，但炼钢炉还是要等温。吴如良点头说：“同志们的干劲确实不小，但却没有抓住关键。把风量开那么大，煤气就变成了废气，你这里费尽了力气，但平炉还是没有煤气。”大家找出了原因以后，立即把风量降小。后来又成立攻关小组，由吴如良亲自指挥，吸取工人中的先进操作技术，总结成一通（通风）、二好（煤气数量好，煤层温度好）、三不结（不结渣、不结凝、不结边）的成套经验，及时纳入操作规程。煤气炉工人贯彻了新的操作方法后，后十天与前十天比较，煤气发热量平均比原来上升了四十大卡，基本上消灭了炉前等温现象。吴如良书记的行动，带动了其余的党员干部，煤气炉、化铁炉各工段的支部书记纷纷到炉前办公，包干围攻各个炉子的具体关键，使不少关键问题迎刃而解。
    党员包干攻关键的办法，同时又能较充分地发挥党组织的核心领导作用和进一步发挥广大职工群众的生产积极性。这一方面是党员要攻克生产关键，就必须走群众路线，依靠群众一起来干；另一方面，群众见党员处处带头，都愿意自觉地投入攻关运动中来。这就在全厂掀起了一个一马当先，万马奔腾的新局面。共产党员、老炼钢工人黄绍荣当班的时候，遇到生产上的困难就及时召开炉边党小组扩大会议（他是党小组长，又是副班长），把问题提出来，同大家商量，发动群众一起来解决。有一次，上一班的冶炼时间拉长了，他便在接班时开了一个炉边会，提出本班坚决执行高温操作，快速炼钢，缩短冶炼时间，替上一班补“欠账”（即未完成的任务）的倡议。由于他平时很关心群众的思想和生活，又能带头苦干，因此，他的提议很快得到了全炉工人的响应。当天，他们果然创造了精炼期最短的新纪录，替上一班留下的一炉钢缩短了冶炼时间。由于冶炼班的共产党员们在包干攻克冶炼关键中，注意了充分依靠群众，他们在坚持多装、快炼、高温、长寿的冶炼方针的基础上，又根据铁水含硫率较高的情况，总结了一套先放、多放、勤放初期渣，少加、勤加石灰石，保持炉内高温沸腾的先进操作经验。冶炼工人们推广了这套先进操作法以后，后十天与前十天作比较，冶炼一炉钢的时间平均缩短了两点十五分钟，其中有不少炉数突破了八小时大关，并在9月8日创造了七点二十三分钟炼一炉钢的最新纪录。化铁炉工段的共产党员和群众一起，共计推行和创造了十六项脱硫的先进经验，将脱硫效率平均提高到48％以上，保证了不让高硫铁水入平炉，给平炉多产钢，产优质钢创造了良好条件。（附图片）
