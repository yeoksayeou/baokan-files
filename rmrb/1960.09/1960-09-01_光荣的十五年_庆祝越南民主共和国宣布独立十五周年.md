    Glorious Fifteen Years
    Celebrating the 15th Anniversary of the Proclamation of Independence of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam
    By Chen Ziping, Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam to the People's Republic of China
    Every nation has a most memorable, glorious, and historically significant day, marking the rise of the nation, its pride, and its belief in a bright future. For the Vietnamese people, that is September 2, 1945. On that day, amidst the joyful atmosphere of the nation celebrating the victory of the August Revolution, President Ho Chi Minh, representing the will of all the Vietnamese people, solemnly declared to the world at Ba Dinh Square in Hanoi, "Vietnam has the right to be free and independent, and in fact has become a free and an independent country. The entire Vietnamese people are determined to use all their spirit and strength, their lives and property to ensure this right to freedom and independence." This is a firm and proud declaration of the Vietnamese nation, a nation that, after nearly a century of heroic resistance against French colonialism and Japanese fascism, raised high the red flag of victory in national liberation in Southeast Asia.
    Fifteen years have passed, and our country has undergone great, earth-shaking changes!
    The August Revolution of 1945 shattered the dark night that had enveloped our people for a century, and opened up a dazzling new world. Under the leadership of the Indochinese Communist Party, headed by our beloved President Ho Chi Minh (now the Vietnam Workers' Party), fifteen years ago, taking advantage of the favorable international conditions created by the heroic Soviet Red Army's defeat of Japanese fascism, the Vietnamese people rose up and shattered the shackles of over eighty years of French imperialism and Japanese fascism, overthrew the millennia-old feudal monarchical system, and established the Democratic Republic of Vietnam – a country where the people are truly masters under the leadership of the working-class party. However, not long after, the French colonialists, with the support of U.S. imperialism, re-launched a war of aggression, attempting to strangle our young republic and dreaming of once again imposing the chains of their evil rule on the Vietnamese people. Responding to the call of the Party and President Ho, the Vietnamese people worked together to resist and save the country, in order to defend the achievements of the August Revolution. In an extremely difficult environment, facing a fierce enemy with superior weaponry, the entire Vietnamese people united as one, fought heroically, demonstrated a spirit of self-sacrifice, and persisted in the nine-year resistance war, finally winning a glorious victory. The historic Dien Bien Phu victory ended the dirty war of aggression launched by French and U.S. imperialism, forcing them to sit down for negotiations and sign the Geneva ceasefire agreement in July 1954, recognizing the sovereignty, independence, and territorial integrity of Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos. The victory of the Vietnamese people's resistance war and the signing of the Geneva agreement not only eloquently proved that the era of imperialism rampaging arbitrarily in Asia was gone forever, but also clearly demonstrated that a nation that has awakened and taken control of its own destiny, when united and determined to fight to defend national independence, cannot be subdued by any reactionary force.
    Peace was restored in Indochina, and the entire north of Vietnam was liberated. However, the south of Vietnam was still temporarily under the evil rule of U.S. imperialism and its lackey, the Ngo Dinh Diem clique. Under the leadership of the Vietnam Workers' Party and President Ho Chi Minh, the Vietnamese people, with even stronger confidence, continued to hold high the banner of patriotism and socialism, striving to build socialism in the north and fighting to achieve national reunification.
    Our north Vietnam is transitioning to socialism from a shattered foundation inherited from colonialism and feudalism, after fifteen years of cruel devastation from war, and with our territory temporarily divided. However, for five years, under the leadership of the Vietnam Workers' Party and the government of the Democratic Republic, headed by President Ho Chi Minh, the national economy of North Vietnam has been rapidly restored and developed, exceeding the level of the highest year of economic development – 1939. The Vietnamese people are proud of the achievements they have made in their creative labor. These achievements have begun to bring a better life to all of North Vietnam.
    The foundations of the old society in North Vietnam are undergoing extremely great changes. The land reform that was already carried out during the war of resistance has been successfully concluded. The rural collectivization movement is developing rapidly.
    To date, 68% of farming households in the plains and 53% of farming households in the mountainous areas have joined agricultural cooperatives, and almost all of the remaining farming households have participated in mutual aid teams. More than 95% of private capitalist enterprises have been transformed into joint state-private enterprises. Hundreds of thousands of small merchants and handicraft laborers are embarking on the path of cooperation. The socialist revolution in North Vietnam has achieved a great victory, transforming our country's economy into a single socialist economy, thereby opening up broad avenues for the development of the productive forces.
    From 1955 to 1959, the value of agricultural output increased by 52.6%. The 1959 rice production more than doubled the pre-war peak of 1939. In 1939, the average person had 211 kilograms of grain per year, while in 1959, it had increased to 350 kilograms per year. In the past, North Vietnam lacked grain every year, and was threatened by famine during the lean season. However, in just five years, North Vietnam's rice production, whether per hectare or per capita, has leaped to the first place among rice-producing countries in Southeast Asia. The problem of grain shortage during the lean season has been basically solved, which demonstrates a bright future for solving the entire grain problem in the process of socialist construction. At the same time, in the past five years, the total value of industrial and handicraft output has increased by 310%, and if only industry is counted, it has increased sevenfold, with state-owned industry increasing sixteenfold. The twenty-one factories and enterprises left over from 1939 were almost completely destroyed in the war. Today, 152 large and medium-sized factories and enterprises have been built in North Vietnam; in 1960, another 72 factories and enterprises will be built, not counting the hundreds of factories and enterprises built by local governments. Now North Vietnam can not only supply most of its light industrial consumer goods itself, but is also starting to build the preliminary foundations of heavy industry.
    These wonderful results of the new life are inspiring the Vietnamese people's enthusiasm for struggling to build socialism. The people of North Vietnam, who once lived in hunger, cold, and extreme poverty under the old social system, cherish the initial results achieved in improving their lives and give them a high evaluation. On a per capita basis, North Vietnam's national income increased by 90% in the four years from 1955 to 1959. The disaster of unemployment has been eliminated. The real wages of workers and staff have increased by more than 55% during this period. Before the August Revolution of 1945, 95% of the people were illiterate, but by the end of 1958, North Vietnam had basically eliminated illiteracy. Whether in remote highlands or vast plains, the light of science and culture has shone on the land, bringing abundant vitality to the creative wisdom of the working people. The various diseases left over from eighty years of evil rule by French colonialists and fifteen years of war have been initially overcome in the past five years. A health care network has begun to take shape throughout the country, and the physical fitness of the people has been strengthened. A healthy and joyful cultural life is developing widely throughout North Vietnam.
    At the beginning of this year, the Vietnamese people celebrated the 30th anniversary of the founding of the Vietnam Workers' Party with unparalleled joy; celebrated the promulgation of the new socialist constitution on January 1; and hailed the victory of the election of the Second National Assembly of Vietnam. While joyfully celebrating the above historical events, the Vietnamese people, regardless of age or gender, felt from the bottom of their hearts that we have today because of the guidance of the Party. The Vietnam Workers' Party and the respected leader Ho Chi Minh - who gloriously accepted the influence of the great Soviet October Revolution, creatively combined the universal truth of Marxism-Leninism with the basic practice of the Vietnamese revolutionary struggle, thus enabling the Vietnamese revolution to go from victory to victory.
    The more jubilant our people are about the great achievements made in building a new life in North Vietnam, the more they hate the U.S.-Ngo clique that is ruling South Vietnam, and are determined to fight them. How can the flames of anger in our hearts be extinguished when half of our country is still immersed in a brutal fascist regime! Every Vietnamese knows that it is U.S. imperialism and its lackeys that are dividing our country. For six years, U.S. imperialism has unscrupulously violated the Geneva Accords, intensifying its efforts to turn South Vietnam into its new type of colony and military base, in order to achieve its conspiracy to attack the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and the socialist camp, seriously threatening the peace of Indochina and Southeast Asia. Peace has been restored for six years, but the sound of gunfire has never stopped in South Vietnam. The U.S.-Ngo clique has brazenly carried out bloody "sweeps," promulgated the fascist Decree No. 10 of 1959, and implemented large-scale massacres of the Southern people. Today, South Vietnam is full of torture chambers and prisons, military bases are being expanded everywhere, and everyone is in an atmosphere of white terror where their lives are in danger. Hundreds of factories and enterprises have been closed down, and the people are threatened by hunger, cold, and unemployment. The lovely people of South Vietnam, with a revolutionary tradition and a spirit of self-sacrifice, will never bow their heads under the enemy's barbaric suppression and persecution. For six years, the momentum of the struggle has been like a surging tide, wave after wave, shaking the foundations of the U.S.-Ngo clique's dictatorial rule. The unwavering will of the people of North Vietnam to struggle for the reunification of their motherland is embodied in their daily labor of building socialism. The peace-loving Vietnamese people and the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam have consistently and solemnly fulfilled the Geneva Accords, and persisted in fighting for the peaceful reunification of their motherland. We have only one Vietnam, only one Vietnamese nation. The conspiracy of the U.S.-Ngo clique to split Vietnamese territory must fail, and Vietnam must be reunified.
    Looking back on the road we have traveled in the past fifteen years, the Vietnamese people deeply realize that the achievements made in carrying out the revolution and peaceful construction are inseparable from the wholehearted support and assistance of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, and inseparable from the sympathy and support of the international workers' movement, the national liberation struggle, and the world's forces for peace and democracy. Historical practice has made it clear to our people the full significance of standing in the fraternal socialist camp. Under the guidance of President Ho Chi Minh, our people cherish and constantly strive to strengthen the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, and to strengthen the unbreakable solidarity of the international workers' movement. We regard it as the most reliable guarantee for the victory of our revolutionary cause. Our people understand that today our struggle against U.S. imperialism and for the reunification of our motherland is an integral part of the overall struggle of the people of the world to defend peace and oppose the bellicose and aggressive U.S. imperialism.
    Vietnam and China are fraternal countries. When our two countries were not yet liberated and were still engaged in arduous revolutionary struggles, Vietnamese and Chinese revolutionary workers were closely linked together for the sake of common ideals and the cause of liberation of their respective nations. In the years when the Vietnamese people were carrying out the revolution and the war of resistance, the Chinese brothers gave us their wholehearted support. Since the restoration of peace, when we are carrying out socialist construction, the Chinese people have given us generous and selfless assistance in the spirit of lofty proletarian internationalism. Therefore, it has played an important role in our country's economic recovery and development, and the development of cultural undertakings. The Vietnamese people express their heartfelt gratitude for this sincere help.
    In recent years, under the wise leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the respected Chairman Mao Zedong, the Chinese people have achieved brilliant victories in the Great Leap Forward. The Vietnamese people cherish these great victories as their own with joy, and warmly feel that it has brought us great encouragement. The people of our two countries both desire a peaceful environment to engage in the construction of our own countries. But our common enemy, U.S. imperialism, is still arrogantly entrenched in Taiwan today, and is increasingly intensifying its interference in South Vietnam. The Vietnamese people firmly support the just struggle of the Chinese people to liberate Taiwan, their sacred territory that cannot be divided. The People's Republic of China is a country that advocates the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, and has consistently pursued a foreign policy of peace and friendship. The Vietnamese people and the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam thoroughly support the proposal of the government of the People's Republic of China on signing a treaty of mutual non-aggression among the countries of Asia and the Pacific region and transforming this region into a nuclear-weapon-free zone.
    On the great festival of our nation, the Vietnamese people see with infinite joy that the lip-and-teeth friendship between our two peoples is growing closer and stronger. President Ho Chi Minh's visit to China and Premier Zhou Enlai's visit to Vietnam are symbols of this increasingly solid unity. As our beloved President Ho Chi Minh said: "Our two parties are brothers, our two governments are brothers, and our two peoples are brothers in the socialist family headed by the great Soviet Union. Our unity is unbreakable."
    Commemorating the great festival of the 15th anniversary of the declaration of independence, from South Vietnam to North Vietnam, the heart of every Vietnamese is filled with a firm belief: Fifteen years ago, when our country was still surrounded by imperialism and international reactionaries after the end of the Second World War, under the leadership of the Vietnam Workers' Party and President Ho Chi Minh, our people united as one, stood up, and held high the banner of national liberation, resistance to aggression, and saving the country. This iron-like revolutionary conviction helped us defeat the enemy. Today, when our country is linked together with fraternal countries, and when the socialist and peace-democratic camp is stronger than ever, our people have even more reason to have unlimited confidence in the bright future of our nation. Although there will still be a long and arduous struggle, Vietnam will surely achieve reunification, and our country will surely achieve even more brilliant victories in the great cause of building socialism.

    光荣的十五年
    庆祝越南民主共和国宣布独立十五周年
    越南民主共和国驻中华人民共和国特命全权大使  陈子平
    每个民族都有它一个最值得纪念的、光荣的、具有历史意义的日子，它标志着本民族的崛起、自豪和对灿烂的未来的信念。对越南人民来说，那就是1945年9月2日。那天，在全国庆贺八月革命取得胜利的欢乐气氛中，胡志明主席在河内巴亭广场上代表着全体越南人民的意志郑重地向全世界宣布：“越南应该有权得到自由和独立，而且事实上我们已经成了一个自由和独立的国家。越南全体人民坚决地把所有的精神和力量、生命和财产来确保这个自由的独立的权利。”这是越南民族坚定的和充满着自豪的宣言，这个民族经过了将近一个世纪英勇反抗法国殖民主义者和日本法西斯，从而在东南亚高举起民族解放胜利的红旗。
    十五年过去了，我国发生了伟大的翻天覆地的变化！
    1945年八月革命冲破了一个世纪以来笼罩在我国人民头上的浓黑的暗夜，进而开辟了一个绚丽夺目的新天地。在以敬爱的胡志明主席为首的印度支那共产党，即今天的越南劳动党的领导下，在十五年前，及时利用英雄的苏联红军击溃日本法西斯的国际有利条件，越南人民挺身而起，粉碎了八十多年法帝国主义和日本法西斯的统治枷锁，推翻了几千年的封建君主制度，建立了越南民主共和国——在工人阶级政党的领导下，人民真正当家做主的国家。但是不多久，法国殖民主义者在美帝国主义的支持下，又重新发动侵略战争，它妄图扼杀我们这个年青的共和国，梦想再一次把罪恶的统治锁链强加在越南人民的脖子上。越南人民响应党和胡主席的号召，同心协力进行抗战救国，以保卫八月革命的成果。处在一个万分艰苦困难的环境中，面对着一个武器装备都比我们占优势的凶恶的敌人，越南全国人民团结一致，英勇战斗，发挥自我牺牲的精神，一直坚持九年抗战，最后赢得了辉煌的胜利。具有历史性的奠边府战役的大捷，结束了由法、美帝国主义发起的肮脏的侵略战争，从而迫使它们坐下来谈判，并于1954年7月签订日内瓦停战协议，承
  认越南、柬埔寨、老挝的主权、独立和领土完整。越南
  人民抗战的胜利和日内瓦协议的签订，不但雄辩地证明了帝国主义随心所欲地在亚洲横行霸道的时代已一去不复返了，而且还清楚地说明了：一个觉醒了的掌握自己命运的民族，当它团结一致，坚决为保卫民族独立而战斗的时候，是任何反动力量所不能屈服的。
    和平在印度支那恢复，我们越南北方全部得到解放。可是，越南南方还暂时处在美帝国主义及其走狗吴庭艳集团的罪恶统治下。在越南劳动党和胡志明主席的领导下，越南人民怀着更坚强的信心，继续高举起爱国主义和社会主义旗帜，努力在北方建设社会主义，并为实现祖国统一而斗争。
    我们越南北方是在接受殖民主义和封建制度遗留下来的支离破碎的基业和经过十五年战争的残酷破坏，以及我们的国土暂时被分割的情况下向社会主义过渡的。但是，五年来在以胡志明主席为首的越南劳动党和越南民主共和国政府的领导下，越南北方的国民经济已经得到迅速恢复和发展，并已超过经济发展最高的年份——1939年的水平。越南人民回顾自己在创造性劳动中所取得的成果而引为自豪。这些成果已开始给全越南北方带来了美好的生活。
    全越南北方的旧社会根基正发生着极其伟大的变化。在抗战期间就已进行的土地改革已胜利结束了。农村合作化运动正迅速地发展着。
    截至目前为止，平原地区已有68％农户，山区已有53％农户加入农业合作社，其余农户几乎已全部参加了变工组。95％以上的私营资本主义企业已实现公私合营。几十万小商贩和手工业劳动者正走上合作化道路。越南北方社会主义革命取得了巨大胜利，正在把我国的经济改变为单一的社会主义经济，从而给生产力的发展开辟了广阔的道路。
    从1955年到1959年，农业产值已增长了52.6％。1959年稻谷的产量比战前产量最高的1939年增加了一倍多，按人口平均计算1939年每人每年可得粮食二百一十一公斤，而1959年已增加到每人每年可得三百五十公斤。从前，越南北方每年都缺少粮食，每到青黄不接季节，都受到饥荒的威胁。但是，仅在短短五年间，越南北方的稻谷产量不论按公顷或者是按人口平均计算，都已经在东南亚各产稻国家跃居第一位。青黄不接季节的粮荒问题已基本上解决，这就给社会主义建设过程中解决全部粮食问题展示了美好的远景。同时，五年来，工业、手工业总产值增加了310％，如果单以工业来说即增长了七倍，其中国营工业即增长到十六倍。1939年留下来的二十一个工厂企业，在战争中几乎破坏无存。今天，全越南北方已兴建起一百五十二个大、中型的工厂企业；1960年又将增建七十二个工厂企业，至于地方增建的几百个工厂企业还不计算在内。现在越南北方不但能够自己供应大部分的轻工业消费品，而且还着手建设重工业的初步基础。
    这些新生活的美好成果正激起了越南人民为建设社会主义而奋斗的热情。过去曾经生活在饥寒交迫、极度贫困的旧社会制度下的越南北方人民，非常珍视目前改善生活所取得的初步成果，并且给予很高的评价。如按人口平均计算，1955年到1959年这四年间，越南北方国民收入已增加90％。失业的灾祸已经消灭了。职工的实际工资在这段时间内已增加了55％以上。在1945年八月革命以前，95％人民是目不识丁的，但是到1958年底，全越南北方已基本上肃清了文盲。不论是在偏僻的高原区或者是在辽阔的平原地区，科学文化的光芒已普照大地，它给劳动人民的创造智慧带来了充沛的生命力。经过法国殖民主义者八十年的罪恶统治和十五年战争而遗留下来的种种疾病，五年来已初步克服了。卫生保健网已开始在全国形成，人民的体质增强了。健康愉快的文化生活正在越南北方各地广泛发展着。
    今年初，越南全国人民怀着无比欢乐的心情庆祝了越南劳动党建党三十周年；庆祝1月1日颁布的社会主义新宪法；欢呼第二届越南国会选举的胜利。在欢欣鼓舞地庆祝上述历史性事件的时候，越南人民不论男女老幼都由衷地体会到我们所以有了今天，是由于党的指引。越南劳动党和敬爱的领袖胡志明主席——他光荣地接受了伟大的苏联十月革命的影响，创造性地把马克思列宁主义的普遍真理同越南革命斗争的基本实践密切结合起来，因而使越南革命从胜利走向胜利。
    我国人民对越南北方建设新生活所取得的伟大成就愈加欢欣鼓舞，那么，对正在统治越南南方的美吴集团就愈加仇恨，并且下定决心与他们展开斗争。我们的一半国土还沉浸在暴虐的法西斯制度下，这怎能熄灭我们的心头怒火！每个越南人都懂得分裂我们国土的正是美帝国主义及其走狗。六年来，美帝国主义肆无忌惮地破坏日内瓦协议，加紧进行使越南南方变为它们的新型殖民地和军事基地，以达到他们向越南民主共和国和社会主义阵营进攻的阴谋，严重地威胁着印度支那和东南亚的和平。和平恢复已经六年了，可是在越南南方没有一天停止过枪声，美吴集团竟悍然进行血腥的“扫荡”，公布1959年第十号法西斯法令，进行大规模屠杀南方人民的罪恶措施。今天的越南南方遍地是刑讯室和牢狱，到处扩建军事基地，每个人都处于生命旦夕不保的白色恐怖气氛里。数以百计的工厂企业停闭了，人民遭到饥寒、失业的威胁。富有革命传统和自我牺牲精神的可爱的越南南方人民，绝不会在敌人野蛮镇压和迫害下低头。六年来，斗争的气势像怒潮汹涌，后浪推着前浪，它正在震撼着美吴集团独裁统治的根基。越南北方人民为统一祖国而斗争的顽强意志，体现在建设社会主义的日常劳动中。爱好和平的越南人民和越南民主共和国政府一贯严正履行日内瓦协议，坚持为实现祖国的和平统一而斗争。我们只有一个越南，只有一个越南民族，美吴集团妄图分裂越南领土的阴谋一定要失败，越南一定要统一。
    回顾十五年来走过的道路，越南人民深刻地体会到，在进行革命和和平建设时所取得的成果是和以苏联为首的社会主义阵营尽心竭力的支持帮助分不开的，是和国际工人运动、民族解放斗争，以及世界和平民主力量的同情和支持分不开的。历史的实践已使我国人民明确地了解到我们站在兄弟的社会主义阵营里的全部意义。我国人民在胡志明主席的教导下，非常珍视和不断地为加强以苏联为首的社会主义阵营，加强国际工人运动的牢不可破的团结一致而奋斗。我们把它看做是我们革命事业取得胜利的最可靠的保障。我国人民了解到，今天我们反对美帝国主义和统一祖国的斗争是全世界人民为保卫和平，反对好战、侵略成性的美帝国主义的总的斗争运动的一个密切的组成部分。
    越中两国是兄弟之邦。当我们两国还未解放，还在进行艰苦的革命斗争的时候，为着共同的理想，为着各自民族的解放事业，越中革命工作者已紧密地连结一起。在越南人民进行革命和抗战的年代，中国兄弟们曾经给我们以尽心竭力的支持。自从和平恢复以来，在我们进行社会主义建设的时候，中国人民以崇高的无产阶级国际主义精神给予我们以慷慨无私的帮助。因此对我国恢复和发展经济、发展文化事业起着重要的作用。越南人民对这种竭诚的帮助表示衷心的感激。
    最近几年来，中国人民在中国共产党和敬爱的毛泽东主席的英明领导下，已取得了大跃进的光辉胜利。越南人民怀着喜悦的心情把这些伟大的胜利当作自己的胜利一样珍贵，而且亲切地感到它已给我们带来了很大的鼓舞。我们两国人民都渴望有一个和平环境来从事建设自己的祖国。可是我们两国的共同敌人美帝国主义，今天仍然蛮横地在台湾盘踞着，和日益加紧对越南南方的干预。越南人民坚决支持中国人民解放自己不可被分割的神圣的领土台湾的正义斗争。中华人民共和国是提倡和平共处五项原则的一个国家，它一贯执行和平和友谊的外交政策。越南人民和越南民主共和国政府彻底支持中华人民共和国政府提出的关于亚洲和太平洋沿岸各国签订一项互不侵犯的和平公约，并把这个地区变成无核武器地区的和平建议。
    在我们民族的伟大节日里，越南人民怀着无限喜悦的心情看到我们两国人民之间的唇齿相依的友谊日益密切和增长。胡志明主席对中国的访问和周恩来总理对越南的访问，是这种日益牢固的团结的象征。正如我们敬爱的胡志明主席所说的：“我们两党是兄弟，我们两国政府是兄弟，我们两国人民是以伟大的苏联为首的社会主义大家庭中的兄弟。我们的团结是牢不可破的。”
    纪念宣布独立十五周年的伟大节日，从越南南方到北方，每个越南人的心里都充满着一种坚定的信念：十五年前，在第二次世界大战刚告结束以后，我们国家还处在受帝国主义和国际反动派包围的情况下，但在越南劳动党和胡志明主席的领导下，我国人民团结一心，站立起来，高举着民族解放、抗战救国的旗帜。这种钢铁般的革命信心帮助我们战胜了敌人。今天，当我国和各兄弟国家联成一片，当社会主义和和平民主阵营比任何时候都更加强大的时候，我国人民更有充分的理由对自己民族的灿烂前途抱着无限的信心。尽管还要进行长期艰苦的斗争，但是越南一定将取得统一，我国一定要在建设伟大的社会主义事业中取得更加辉煌的胜利。
