Xinhua News Agency, September 28th: Our correspondent reports: The heroic Algerian people, holding high the banner of the national independence war, have consistently persisted in tenacious struggle over the past six years, severely打击 (dǎ jī -punched / hit) the French colonialists who are strongly supported by US imperialism. Now, the Algerian National Liberation Army has grown from three thousand to about one hundred and fifty thousand people, liberating two-thirds of the country's territory. The Algerian people's struggle experience proves that all imperialists can be defeated.

The Algerian people's struggle vividly shows that all imperialists are outwardly strong but inwardly weak and can be defeated. Six years ago, in November 1954, when three thousand Algerian guerrillas launched an armed uprising, the French colonialists used a superior force of fifty thousand troops, adopting cruel methods such as "appeasement" and "blockade," and launched a dirty colonial war, attempting to crush the uprising in one fell swoop. However, for six years, with the support of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization aggressive bloc headed by the United States, France has not only failed to achieve its goal of conquering Algeria by force but has also been dragged into a state of exhaustion. It has lost about one hundred and fifty thousand troops. Currently, the French imperialists have increased their troop deployment in Algeria from fifty thousand to six hundred thousand, in addition to equipping about two hundred thousand various "security forces." The French government's war expenses in both last year's and this year's budgets have reached over one trillion francs.

At the same time, the Algerian National Liberation Army, supported by the people, has strengthened itself in combat and become stronger as it fought. In January 1959, the Algerian National Liberation Army, with relatively inferior forces, broke through the "impregnable" Maurice Line (over three hundred kilometers long, with a one-kilometer-deep power grid on the Algerian-Tunisian border) which the French invading army had heavily touted. Subsequently, in August and September of the same year, it shattered the large-scale encirclement (the so-called "Operation Gemini") launched by French invading army commander Charles, with one hundred thousand troops. These major military victories declared the complete bankruptcy of the French invading army's "blockade" policy, severely打击 (dǎ jī -punched / hit) French imperialism, and further encouraged the Algerian people's confidence and determination to fight for national independence. In recent times, the French colonial army has been in a situation of being beaten everywhere and being exhausted. According to incomplete statistics, from July 30th to August 31st this year, the National Liberation Army killed or wounded more than three thousand four hundred French troops and captured more than six hundred and fifty various weapons. In the first ten days of September, it annihilated more than two thousand two hundred French invading troops. Even the French invaders hiding in major cities were occasionally attacked by the Algerian armed forces.

	Weapons are not the decisive factor in war; the trend of popular sentiment is the source of victory.

These major achievements of the Algerian people in the military field also show that the decisive factor in determining the outcome of a war is not weapons but the trend of popular sentiment. As Algerian Deputy Prime Minister Krim Belkacem said, the source of strength of the Algerian army lies in the fact that it is a patriotic volunteer army, a people's army with the lofty ideal of national independence. This armed force, fighting for national liberation, is loved by the masses. Algerian peasants often risk the danger of their entire family or even the entire village being massacred to protect and help the National Liberation Army, acting as sentries, guides, or delivering intelligence. Some impoverished peasants leave their only food for the Liberation Army. Algerian famous patriot and National Liberation Front member Lakhlifi wrote to his family before being captured and killed by the French army: "I live for my people. I fight for the independence of my country. As I die, I am confident that my country will become independent and free." It is this high degree of national consciousness that makes the Algerian National Liberation Army an invincible force.

For six years, the French imperialists, harboring deep hatred for the Algerian people and calling themselves "messengers of civilization," have been carrying out a frantic and inhuman massacre in Algeria. They massacred one million innocent Algerians, detained another one million in concentration camps, and imprisoned hundreds of thousands more, inflicting all kinds of horrific torture. However, the Algerian people did not succumb to this. Contrary to the wishes of imperialism, the countless crimes committed by French imperialism in Algeria have been unanimously condemned by world justice and public opinion, only placing it in an increasingly isolated position.

While frantically suppressing the Algerian people, French imperialism also used flowery words such as "self-determination" and "negotiations" to play political deception plots, attempting to obtain what it had not achieved on the battlefield. Last September, precisely after the Algerian National Liberation Army shattered the "Charles Plan" and achieved a major victory, de Gaulle put forward the so-called "proposal" to let "Algerians freely choose their own future to solve the problem." On June 14th of this year, de Gaulle reiterated the principle of giving the Algerian people the "right to self-determination" and proposed a posture of preparing for negotiations. However, when the Provisional Government of the Republic of Algeria sent a delegation to Melun, France, to hold preliminary talks with France, the mask of French imperialism was torn off, revealing its true colors. The French government, which invited the negotiations, had no sincerity in negotiating with the other party on an equal footing. It did not allow Algerian representatives to have the same status as French officials, did not allow the Algerian delegation freedom of movement in Paris, and even openly threatened the other party: "Either accept these conditions or reject them." This is certainly an attitude that no dignified government can tolerate. Therefore, the Provisional Government of the Republic of Algeria issued a communiqué, resolutely stating that it was inappropriate to send a delegation to France for negotiations under such circumstances and conditions. Prime Minister Abbas also said in Tunis on July 26th that the Melun meeting showed that de Gaulle was determined to make the Algerian National Liberation Front surrender, and also showed that the French government was actively pursuing a policy of war. He said, "As long as the French government does not agree to negotiate on the conditions for sincerely implementing self-determination, the Algerian people and their National Liberation Army will continue to fight until final victory." The Algerian National Liberation Front's official newspaper "El Moudjahid" also published an editorial saying: "The most important way to strengthen our struggle is certainly to greatly strengthen our military strength, because this is the only language that the French colonialists understand, and it is the most important way to completely eliminate international colonialism from our African continent."

The Algerian people's struggle for liberation has set an example for the African national independence movement.

What happened in Algeria also clearly shows that US imperialism, the most ferocious and dangerous enemy of the African people, is the main supporter of France's bloody colonial war. US President Eisenhower openly stated on July 3, 1957: "Legally speaking, Algeria is now considered an integral part of French national territory," completely obliterating the Algerian people's right to independence. The United States has provided French colonialists with a large amount of money and weapons. From 1950 to 1960, the United States gave France as much as 4.5 billion US dollars in military assistance. More than 70% of the weapons used by the French colonial army on the Algerian battlefield were supplied by the North Atlantic aggressive bloc headed by the United States. American military technicians are also stationed at Boufarik and Boni airports in Algeria, maintaining and repairing American aircraft for the French invading army. It can be said that without the support of US imperialism, France would not be able to sustain this war of aggression at all. The Algerian people's just struggle against imperialism and for national liberation has set a brilliant example for the African national independence movement and is increasingly gaining the sympathy and support of the people of the world. The Second Asian-African People's Solidarity Conference and the All-African People's Conference have both passed resolutions supporting the Algerian people. The Chinese people have always stood by the Algerian people and supported the Algerian people's just struggle for national independence. China was one of the first countries to recognize the Provisional Government of Algeria. In recent years, friendly exchanges between the Chinese and Algerian peoples have been developing continuously. We firmly believe that the Algerian people, supported by the people of the world, will surely win independence and win the final victory as long as they persist in struggle and persist in unity.

### 高举民族独立战争的大旗　阿尔及利亚人民胜利前进

　　高举民族独立战争的大旗
　　阿尔及利亚人民胜利前进
    新华社28日讯　本社记者报道：英勇的阿尔及利亚人民高举着民族独立战争的大旗，在过去的六年中始终坚持顽强的斗争，沉重地打击了受到美帝国主义大力支持的法国殖民主义者。现在，阿尔及利亚民族解放军已由三千人发展到十五万人左右，解放了全国三分之二的土地。阿尔及利亚人民斗争经验证明一切帝国主义都是可以打败的
    阿尔及利亚人民斗争的经过生动地表明：一切帝国主义者都是外强中干的，都是可以打败的。六年以前的1954年11月，当阿尔及利亚三千名游击队员掀起武装起义时，法国殖民主义者曾以五万名军队的优势兵力，采用“绥靖”、“封锁”等等残酷的办法，发动了肮脏的殖民战争，企图一举而扑灭这一起义。但是，六年以来，法国在以美国为首的北大西洋公约侵略集团的支持下，不仅没有实现以武力征服阿尔及利亚的目的，而且还被拖得兵穷财尽。丧失了十五万人左右的兵力，现在，法帝国主义投入阿尔及利亚的兵力已从五万人激增到六十万人，另外还配备了约二十万人的各种“保安部队”。法国政府去年度和今年度预算中的战费，都已达到一万亿法郎以上。
    与此同时，受到人民支持的阿尔及利亚民族解放军，在战斗中壮大了自己，越战越强。1959年1月，阿尔及利亚民族解放军以相对劣势的兵力，突破了法国侵略军所大肆吹嘘的“不可突破”的莫里斯防线（在阿尔及利亚—突尼斯边界上，长达三百多公里，设有纵深一公里的电网）。接着，在同年8、9月间，又粉碎了侵阿法军司令夏耳所发动的十万人大围剿（所谓的“双胞胎行动”）。这些军事上的重大胜利，宣告法国侵略军“封锁”政策的彻底破产，狠狠打击了法帝国主义，也进一步鼓舞了阿尔及利亚人民为民族独立而战的信心和斗志。最近一个时期以来，法国殖民军已处于到处挨打、疲于奔命的境地。据不完全的统计，从今年7月30日到8月31日，民族解放军就毙伤法军三千四百多人，缴获六百五十多件各种武器。而9月份的头十天，又歼灭了二千二百多名法国侵略军。连躲在各大城市中的法国侵略者，也不时遇到阿尔及利亚武装力量的袭击。
      武器不是决定战争胜负的因素人心趋向才是取得胜利的源泉
    阿尔及利亚人民在军事上所取得的这些重大成就也说明：决定战争胜负的因素不是武器，而是人心的向背。正像阿尔及利亚副总理克里姆·贝勒卡塞姆所说：阿尔及利亚军队的力量源泉在于它是爱国的志愿军，是怀有民族独立的崇高理想的人民军队。这支为民族解放而作战的武装得到人民群众的热爱。阿尔及利亚的农民们常常冒着全家甚至全村人被屠杀的危险来掩护和帮助民族解放军，给他们放哨，充当向导或赶送情报。有些贫苦农民把自己仅有的食物留给解放军。阿尔及利亚著名爱国者、民族解放阵线成员拉克利菲在被法军俘获杀害之前曾写信给家人说：“我为自己的人民而生。我为我国的独立而斗争。在我临死的时候，我确信，我的国家将成为独立的和自由的。”正是这种高度的民族觉悟，使阿尔及利亚民族解放军成为一支不可战胜的力量。
    六年来，对阿尔及利亚人民怀有刻骨仇恨而又自称为“文明使者”的法帝国主义，一直在阿尔及利亚进行着疯狂的、灭绝人性的屠杀。它屠杀了一百万无辜的阿尔及利亚人民，把另外一百万人拘于集中营，还有数十万人被投入监狱，施加种种骇人听闻的酷刑。但是，阿尔及利亚人民并没有因此而屈服。恰恰同帝国主义的愿望相反，法帝国主义在阿尔及利亚所犯下来的罄竹难书的罪行，受到了世界正义舆论的一致谴责，只是使它自己处于愈来愈加孤立的地位。
    法帝国主义在对阿尔及利亚人民进行疯狂镇压的同时，还利用“自决”、“谈判”等花言巧语来玩弄政治欺骗的阴谋，企图骗取它在战场上所没有取得的东西。去年9月，正是在阿尔及利亚民族解放军粉碎“夏耳计划”、取得大捷之后，戴高乐提出了所谓要让“阿尔及利亚人对他们自己的前途进行自由选择来解决”的“建议”。今年6月14日，戴高乐又重谈所谓给予阿尔及利亚人民“自决权”的原则，并且提出了准备谈判的姿态。但是，当阿尔及利亚共和国临时政府派出代表团前去法国默伦和法国举行预备会谈时，法帝国主义的假面具就被揭穿，原形毕露。邀请谈判的法国政府毫无同对方平等协商的诚意。它不许阿尔及利亚代表与法国官员有同等身份，不许阿尔及利亚代表团在巴黎有行动自由，甚至公然威胁对方：“要么接受这些条件，要么就拒绝它们”。这当然是任何有尊严的政府所不能容忍的态度。因此，阿尔及利亚共和国临时政府发表公报，毅然表示在这种情况和条件下，派代表团去法国谈判是不合时宜的。阿巴斯总理7月26日也在突尼斯发表谈话说，默伦会议表明，戴高乐执意企图使阿尔及利亚民族解放战线投降，同时也表明法国政府正在积极奉行战争政策。他说，“只要法国政府不同意就真诚执行自决的条件进行谈判，阿尔及利亚人民和他们的民族解放军就将继续进行斗争直到最后胜利。”阿尔及利亚民族解放阵线机关报“圣战者报”也发表社论说：“加强我们斗争的最重要方法，肯定是大力加强我们的军事力量，因为这是法国殖民主义者所了解的唯一语言，是彻底肃清国际殖民主义在我们非洲大陆的最重要堡垒的途径。”
    阿尔及利亚人民争取解放的斗争给非洲民族独立运动树立了榜样
    在阿尔及利亚发生的情况，还十分清楚地表明：非洲人民最凶恶、最危险的敌人美帝国主义，是法国进行这场血腥的殖民战争的主要支持者。美国总统艾森豪威尔1957年7月3日就曾公开表示：“从法律上说，阿尔及利亚现在被认为是法国本国领土整体的一部分”，完全抹煞了阿尔及利亚人民独立的权利。美国更大量供给法国殖民者以金钱和枪炮。从1950年到1960年，美国给予法国的军事援助竟多达四十五亿美元。法国殖民军在阿尔及利亚战场上所使用的武器，有70％以上是由以美国为首的北大西洋侵略集团供应的。美国军事技术人员还驻在阿尔及利亚的布法列克和波尼机场，替法国侵略军维护和修理美国飞机。可以说，如果没有美帝国主义的支持，法国是根本不可能维持这场侵略战争的。阿尔及利亚人民反对帝国主义争取民族解放的正义斗争，为非洲民族独立运动树立了光辉的榜样，愈来愈得到全世界人民的同情和支持。第二届亚非人民团结大会和全非人民大会都通过支持阿尔及利亚人民的决议。中国人民也一贯站在阿尔及利亚人民的一边，支持阿尔及利亚人民为争取民族独立而进行的正义斗争。中国是最早承认阿尔及利亚临时政府的国家之一。近年来，中阿两国人民之间的友好往来不断在发展。我们坚决相信：受到全世界人民支持的阿尔及利亚人民，只要坚持斗争，坚持团结，一定能够赢得独立，赢得最后的胜利。
