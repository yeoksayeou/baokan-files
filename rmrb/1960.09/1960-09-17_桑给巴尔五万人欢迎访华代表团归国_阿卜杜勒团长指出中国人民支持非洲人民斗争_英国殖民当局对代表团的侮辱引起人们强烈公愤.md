Xinhua News Agency, September 16th, Zanzibar News: Over 50,000 people in Zanzibar held a mass rally to welcome the Zanzibar Nationalist Party delegation's return from China. The head of the delegation, the Vice President of the Zanzibar Nationalist Party, Miraj Shariff Abduhl, reported on the tremendous progress they witnessed in China.
    He said, "The Chinese are a great and glorious people, and we must never be deceived by imperialist propaganda, which aims to undermine Asian-African solidarity. The message I bring back from China is: 650 million Chinese people support our struggle."
    He also spoke about the enthusiastic support the government received from the masses and the technological progress they witnessed in China.
    It is reported that this delegation was subjected to the most disgraceful treatment by the imperialists on its way back home when passing through Nairobi Airport in Kenya and after returning to Zanzibar.
    At Nairobi Airport, they were stripped naked by the British colonial customs authorities in Kenya, who treated them like "criminals," inspecting their bodies and luggage.
    When they returned to Zanzibar, they were subjected to the same insults by the British colonialists. The British colonial authorities' "Immigration Bureau" confiscated their passports.
    These imperialist insults to the delegation have aroused anger among people from all walks of life in Zanzibar, who are now more determined than ever to get rid of the imperialists and their machinery of aggression as soon as possible.
    A member of the delegation, the Acting Secretary-General of the Zanzibar Nationalist Party, Bursala, condemned imperialism as the most tyrannical system in history at a mass rally held in Kenjijia on Pemba Island (Zanzibar Island's sister island).
    Bursala pointed out that the imperialists' confiscation of their passports showed their own weakness. It is obvious that the people have now caused the imperialists to lose confidence. He said that the imperialists have shown that they have absolutely no respect for the human rights declaration that they hypocritically claim to support.
    The Chairman of the Pemba Region of the Zanzibar Nationalist Party, Hamadi, also pointed out at the meeting that the days of imperialism are numbered.
    The Zanzibar weekly "Adal Insaf" commented on the incident, saying that it was extremely disgraceful to treat the Zanzibar Nationalist Party delegation in this way. This will only strengthen the Zanzibar people's determination to oppose imperialism. Although the threat of imperialism is becoming increasingly aggressive, more and more people are winning victories in the struggle against imperialism.

    桑给巴尔五万人欢迎访华代表团归国
    阿卜杜勒团长指出中国人民支持非洲人民斗争
    英国殖民当局对代表团的侮辱引起人们强烈公愤
    新华社16日讯　桑给巴尔消息：在桑给巴尔五万多人举行群众大会欢迎桑给巴尔民族主义党代表团访问中国归来。代表团团长、桑给巴尔民族主义党副主席米拉茨·谢拉布·阿卜杜勒报告了他们在中国看到的巨大进步。
    他说，“中国人是伟大而光荣的人民，我们决不要受帝国主义宣传的欺骗，帝国主义宣传的目的是要破坏亚洲非洲的团结。我从中国带回来的消息是：六亿五千万中国人支持我们的斗争。”
    他还谈到代表团在中国看到的政府受到群众热烈支持以及技术进步的情况。
    据报道，这个代表团在回国途中经过怯尼亚首府内罗毕机场以及在回到桑给巴尔后曾受到了帝国主义者最可耻的对待。
    在内罗毕机场，他们被怯尼亚英国殖民者的海关当局剥光了衣服，当作“犯人”似地检查了他们的身体和行李。
    当他们回到桑给巴尔后，也受到英国殖民者的同样的侮辱。英国殖民当局的“移民局”没收了他们的护照。
    帝国主义者对代表团的这种侮辱引起了桑给巴尔各界人民的愤慨，现在他们比以往更加决心要尽快摆脱帝国主义者及其侵略机器。
    这个代表团的团员、桑给巴尔民族主义党代理总书记布尔萨拉在奔巴岛（桑给巴尔岛的姊妹岛）肯吉贾举行的群众大会上谴责帝国主义是有史以来最暴虐的制度。
    布尔萨拉指出，帝国主义者没收了他们的护照，从而显示了他们自己的软弱。显而易见，人民现在使帝国主义者失去了信心。他说，帝国主义者表明他们完全不尊重他们假惺惺保证支持的人权宣言。
    桑给巴尔民族主义党奔巴地区主席哈马迪也在会上指出，帝国主义的日子屈指可数了。
    桑给巴尔“阿达尔因萨夫”周刊就这件事发表评论说，用这种方式对待桑给巴尔民族主义党的代表团是极为可耻的。这只会使桑给巴尔人民反对帝国主义的决心更加坚强。帝国主义的威胁虽然日益咄咄逼人，但是越来越多的人在反对帝国主义的斗争中获得了胜利。
