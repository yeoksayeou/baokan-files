News Briefs

	Concentrate Efforts to Increase Coking Coal Production
	In the campaign to increase production and practice economy, the Tonghua Mining Bureau in Jilin Province has implemented a method of "centering on coking coal, washed coal, and transportation; construction serving production; non-coking coal mines serving coking coal mines; and comprehensive support for key points." The bureau continued to delegate 690 cadres to work in groups and transferred 7 digging teams, totaling more than 370 people, to support the production of three key coking coal mines. From September 1st to 5th, the average daily coal output increased by 19.41% compared to the previous five days, and the output of washed coal increased by 20%.

	Three Experiences in Simultaneous Mining and Excavation
	The Jian’ou Coal Mine in Fujian Province has summarized three experiences for achieving high-speed and proportional development of mining and excavation: First, adopt the method of "two excavations to guarantee one mining" to ensure that the number of excavation faces is greater than the number of mining faces; second, when coal production increases substantially, the amount of excavation must be increased proportionally; third, the labor ratio between excavation and mining should be fixed at about 1:2. The mine has used these three experiences to maintain a sufficient amount of coal available for mining. The amount of coal produced from January to August 25 increased by 131% compared to January-August of last year.

	Advance Transportation of Key Materials
	The Nanjing Railway Bureau, Hangzhou Railway Bureau, and Shanghai Railway Office under the Shanghai Railway Administration, in order to achieve balanced transportation despite the increased freight volume in the fourth quarter, ensuring that grain and steel materials are shipped first while also meeting the needs of people's lives, began to vigorously organize advance transportation from the third quarter, prioritizing the shipment of fertilizers, pesticides, agricultural machinery, ores, coke, steelmaking equipment, and other materials. More than 410,000 tons of materials originally planned for transportation in September and the fourth quarter have been shipped out in advance in August.

	Coal Production Base Saves Coal
	The people of Huainan City, a major coal production base in the country, are comprehensively carrying out activities to save coal. The methods they have adopted are: implementing planned supply and variety matching for industrial coal use throughout the city, using good coal for coking; widely promoting advanced experiences in saving coal in various enterprises; using coal slime and coke powder for domestic coal use; vigorously carrying out the recovery of coking by-products, and building gas stoves, etc. In the past eight months, the city has saved a total of more than 232,000 tons of coal.

	Diligent Testing, Careful Material Selection
	The iron smelting plants in Jincheng, Shanxi Province, have improved and strengthened their testing institutions, conducting regular testing and research; they have implemented layer-by-layer careful selection of raw materials and fuels, ensuring that miscellaneous materials, raw ore, and greenstone do not enter the furnace; at the same time, they have actively improved operating methods. The qualified rate of pig iron in various factories has been continuously improved, with the proportion of first-grade products increasing from 50% to 80%, basically eliminating third-grade pig iron.

    要闻快报
    集中力量增产焦煤
    吉林省通化矿务局在增产节约运动中，实行了“以焦煤、精煤、运输为中心，建设服从生产，非焦煤井服从焦煤井，全面支援重点”的办法。全局继续下放了六百九十名干部到小组工作，抽调了七个掘进队共三百七十多人，支援三个重点焦煤矿井的生产。九月一日到五日，煤炭平均日产量比前五天提高百分之十九点四一，精煤产量提高百分之二十。
    采掘并举的三条经验
    福建省建瓯煤矿总结出三条采掘高速度按比例发展的经验：一、采取“二掘保一采”的办法，保证掘进工作面多于回采工作面；二、当煤炭大幅度高产时，必须按比例地增加掘进量；三、掘和采的劳力比例固定为一比二左右。这个矿运用这三条经验，使全矿经常保持有足够的回采获得煤量。一月到八月二十五日产煤数量，比去年一至八月增长百分之一百三十一。
    提前运输重点物资
    上海铁路总局管辖的南京、杭州铁路局和上海铁路办事处，为了在第四季度运量增大的情况下，也能实现均衡运输，既确保粮、钢物资先行，又能满足人民生活方面的需要，从第三季度起，就开始大力组织提前运输，优先发运化肥、农药、农业机械、矿石、焦炭、炼钢设备等物资。原计划在九月份和第四季度运输的物资，已有四十一万多吨提前在八月份运出。
    产煤基地节约煤
    全国重要煤炭基地——淮南市的人民全面开展节约煤炭活动。他们采取的办法是：对全市工业用煤实行计划供应和品种搭配的办法，把好煤用于炼焦；在各企业普遍推广节约用煤的先进经验；生活用煤用煤泥和焦粉；大搞炼焦副产品回收，大建煤气炉等。今年八个月来，全市共节约二十三万二千多吨煤炭。
    勤化验细选料
    山西晋城各炼铁厂健全和加强了化验机构，进行经常性的化验和研究；对原料、燃料实行层层细选，保证杂料、生矿、青石不入炉；同时积极改进操作方法。各厂生铁合格率不断提高，一级品由百分之五十提高到百分之八十，基本上消灭了三级品生铁。
