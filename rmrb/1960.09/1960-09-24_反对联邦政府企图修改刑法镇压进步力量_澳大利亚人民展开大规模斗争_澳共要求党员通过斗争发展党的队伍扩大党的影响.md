　　Xinhua News Agency, Sydney, 23rd: A large-scale mass movement has been launched in Australia against the federal government's actions to amend the federal criminal law in order to suppress progressive forces. Participants in this movement include the Australian Communist Party, various trade unions, as well as workers, intellectuals, students, journalists, and religious figures.

　　The proposed amendments to the criminal law, which are pending parliamentary review, stipulate that any form of support for the people of colonies, even verbal or written expressions of moral support, can be punishable by death. Anyone who supports countries fighting against Australia's allies can be charged with "treason" and sentenced to fifteen years of imprisonment. It also stipulates that so-called "sabotage" in strike incidents in certain "prohibited places" (meaning workers holding strikes in factories or workplaces) will also be punished.

　　The Political Bureau of the Australian Communist Party issued a statement calling on the people and Communist Party members to do everything possible to fight against the amendment of the criminal law. The statement said that because the Communist Party wages an uncompromising struggle for the interests of the working class, it has always been a specific target of reactionary attacks. The statement also called on members to develop party members and expand the party's influence through this great struggle.

　　The Australian Communist Party's newspaper "Tribune Weekly" pointed out that the purpose of the new bill is to suppress criticism of the reactionary policies of American imperialists and the Australian government, and it attempts to suppress the trade union movement and the activities of the Communist Party.

　　According to "Tribune Weekly," the actions already launched against this amendment include: miners in some mines holding strikes; representatives of thirty trade unions in Newcastle, one of New South Wales' heavy industrial centers, jointly sending telegrams of protest; the Labor Council issuing a call that if the amendment of the criminal law continues, affiliated trade unions will hold strikes, and establishing a trade union struggle fund to support propaganda against the amendment; someone suggesting holding a national protest day, with trade unions sending large delegations to visit members of parliament and demanding resolute opposition to the amendment of the criminal law; protest rallies in dozens of industries; and more than four hundred students at the University of Sydney announcing that they oppose the amendment that threatens freedom.

　　Communist Party members in New South Wales held a meeting on September 17 to discuss plans to hold a propaganda campaign to defend the party, peace, and civil rights. The Communist Party distributed hundreds of thousands of leaflets and topical pamphlets, exposing the government's attempts.

　　Watt, chairman of the Communist Party's New South Wales Committee, said that this bill is a step towards a police state, but the united working class and its allies can defeat this bill.

　　The "Sydney Sun" also published an editorial on the evening of the 21st, saying that the amendment would make the security police the masters of the people - "new Gestapo acting under the protection of the law."

　　有待议会审议的刑法修正案规定，对殖民地人民任何形式的支持可以处以死刑。支援对澳大利亚“盟国”作战的国家将被控“叛国罪”而处十五年徒刑。
    新华社23日讯　悉尼消息：在澳大利亚已经掀起了一个大规模的群众运动，反对联邦政府为镇压进步力量而修改联邦刑法的行动。参加这个运动的有澳大利亚共产党、各工会以及工人、知识分子、学生、新闻界和宗教界人士等。
    有待议会审议的刑法修正案规定，对殖民地人民的任何形式的支援即使是口头或书面表示的道义的支持也可以处以死刑。任何人支援那些对澳大利亚的盟国作战的国家可以被控告犯了“叛国罪”而处以十五年徒刑。它还规定，在某些“禁止的场所”参与罢工事件的所谓“破坏行为”（意即工人在工厂或工作场所举行罢工）也将予以处罚。
    澳大利亚共产党政治局发表声明要求人民和共产党员竭尽一切努力来进行反对修改刑事法的斗争。声明说，由于共产党为工人阶级的利益进行毫不调和的斗争，它一直是反动派进攻的特定对象。声明还要求党员通过这个伟大斗争来发展党员和扩大党的影响。
    澳大利亚共产党机关报“论坛周报”指出，新法案目的是压制对美帝国主义者和澳大利亚政府的反动政策的批评，它企图镇压工会运动和共产党的活动。
    据“论坛周报”报道，已经展开的反对这项修正案的行动包括：一些矿井的矿工举行罢工；新南威尔士重工业中心之一纽卡斯尔的三十个工会的代表联名致电抗议；劳工理事会发出号召，如果继续进行修改刑法，所属工会就举行罢工，建立了工会斗争基金来支援反对修正案的宣传；有人建议举行全国抗议日，由各工会派遣庞大的代表团访问议员，要求坚决反对修改刑法；几十个行业的抗议集会；悉尼大学四百多名学生宣布，他们反对威胁自由的修正案。
    新南威尔士共产党党员在9月17日举行集会讨论计划举行宣传运动来保卫党、和平与公民权利。共产党散发了以数十万计的传单和专题的小册子，揭露政府的企图。
    共产党新南威尔士委员会主席瓦特说，这个法案是走向警察国家的一步，但是，奋起团结一致的工人阶级和它的同盟者能够击败这个法案。
    “悉尼太阳报”21日晚间也发表社论说，修正案将使保安警察成为人民的主宰者——“在法律庇护下行动的新盖世太保”。
