Speech by President Sékou Touré at the Welcome Rally by People from All Walks of Life in the Capital

Xinhua News Agency, 12th – The full text of the speech by the President of the Republic of Guinea, Sékou Touré, at the welcome rally by people from all walks of life in the capital is as follows:

Your Excellency, Mr. Chairman of the Republic, dear friends, ministers, political, trade union, and military leaders, youth, women, dear brothers,

The sympathy, trust, and determination to fight that your masses of people constantly express to the Guinean delegation are definitely expressed to all progressive humanity, especially to the African peoples fighting for freedom and democracy. Our delegation is only a symbol of this part of the earth, which is fighting more and more bravely and consciously with you against imperialism, so that we can realize our human desire for freedom, democracy, and progress through the efforts of all people.

We know that since the birth of mankind on earth, people have been constantly fighting, fighting against nature and its various phenomena, in order to utilize natural resources for the development of mankind. People are also constantly fighting to overcome people's selfishness and bad behavior. The current anti-imperialist struggle by all countries has given greater value to mankind's struggle for social, economic, and cultural well-being. This struggle in Africa should not be understood as purely emotional, but should be understood as having historical origins. This struggle is not only necessary for Africa to achieve human social equality based on social justice, but also necessary for Africa to be able to live in full friendship and full cooperation with other peoples in the world, so that each society can not only utilize natural wealth, but also utilize its own intelligence and material, moral, and cultural wealth under the guarantee of security and peace. In that way, all the talents of mankind will be able to be developed under the best conditions.

Therefore, Africa hopes to be a force for peace – a force that is a contribution to other peoples. Among your many magnificent expressions, what impresses us most is first of all the universal nature of the principles and ideals that inspire you, which are not in any way contradictory to the deep aspirations of the peoples of the world, because like the people of your country, the African people also want to live a completely free life.

Our difference from the evil forces represented and embodied by international imperialism lies in the fact that this force does not help mankind rebuild its unity, does not help mankind increase its knowledge, promote its achievements in science and culture, and improve the objective and spiritual conditions of life, nor does it enable mankind to control nature. On the contrary, imperialism wants to divide mankind, divide nations, and divide people in the same country, with the aim of continuing to promote its system of exploitation and oppression that impoverishes the masses. The difference between our common policy and the policy of imperialism lies precisely in the human nature of our civilization, our culture, and our program, precisely in the inhumanity of the imperialist program, what imperialism has already done and what it still intends to do. Therefore, if the struggle between justice and injustice, the struggle between freedom and enslavement, the struggle between progress and reaction – the struggle engaged in by enlightened countries on the one hand, and the struggle waged by selfish interest groups on the other – continues, then we can assert that no matter how long this mutual struggle lasts, only one side can win, and that is only the side of the people's strength! The power of the people bears the responsibility of upholding the ideals of freedom, democracy, fraternity, and cooperation between people and between countries.

As you know, before being subjected to colonial rule, the African people originally had their own countries, which were organized on the basis of social balance and taking into account the means of production they possessed. Although these means were primitive compared to the modern means used by some countries in Western Europe, we dare to assert that Africa's economic and social civilization would never allow the deprivation of people's freedom for the benefit of the rich.

It was colonial rule that forcibly established a new hierarchy of values, placing money above everything, dividing and dividing African society again, thereby disintegrating the society and engaging in the exploitation and oppression of our peoples by unjust means in economic, social, and cultural aspects. However, imperialism and its accompanying colonialism presumptuously claimed that they had a civilizing mission, and this civilization was precisely to massacre innocent people with rifles and cannons, precisely to implement forced labor, precisely to exploit the working masses, precisely to implement racial discrimination and cultural oppression, and finally, this civilization was precisely to stifle the character of Africa, making Africans unable to take responsibility for their own affairs, thereby creating a sense of inferiority. Therefore, it was the conditions created by imperialism – the unjust conditions – that aroused the resistance of African peoples, because the various activities of imperialists and colonialists hurt the dignity of African peoples.

Recognizing the unjust phenomena caused by imperialism in the lives of all peoples – this awakening is also the main driving force of the African revolution – this explains to you that the African revolution is fundamentally opposed to the maintenance of imperialism, and every progress that Africa makes on the road to political, economic, social, and cultural liberation means the failure of imperialism. It is precisely because you have driven away imperialism over the long years with simple material conditions and with superhuman efforts, precisely because you have embarked on the road of friendship between all peoples, on the road of building a new human society without any exploitation and oppression, so for the African peoples, you are not only a heroic example, but also a vital force. We are convinced that all other anti-imperialist peoples who are carrying out the same revolution in order to take full responsibility in managing their own affairs will be able to trust the African peoples who, like them, belong to the camp of peace and freedom; the more these peoples increase their understanding and the better they organize united action, the more effective our common struggle will be; then, the ideal that we all care about at all times: the ideal of ending imperialism, ending all kinds of colonialism, and ending feudalism, can be realized more quickly.

While paying tribute to the great contribution of your people and assuring you that the African continent will make increasingly high-quality contributions to the common struggle, we want to say to you again: We will all fight for a common victory. The road to victory is no longer long, because in Africa, in Asia, in the Americas, in Europe, in all human societies, the forces against imperialism are growing stronger and stronger; and as we are liberated one after another, as the strength of our struggle against imperialism becomes stronger and stronger, the number and power of those who insist on maintaining injustice in the world will be weakened day by day. We have just said that victory belongs to our side, and the road to victory is no longer long, because we all realize that we must eliminate the causes that divide and make our mankind backward.

Therefore, our friend, the Mayor of Beijing, is very correct in comparing imperialism to a jackal. Indeed: the jackal can change its appearance, if it wants to; it can change its language, if it wants to; it can change its position, if it wants to; but its nature can never be changed, that is to say, it can never change its actions towards goats, especially when these goats have not yet united.

For example, politicians, heads of state, ministers, and political leaders in many countries in the world, although they often talk about democracy, freedom, and independence, they continue to obstruct the liberation of Algeria, the complete liberation of the Congo, and the liberation of Angola, and obstruct the normal development of free peoples. This situation explains why the victory of the people must be in the hands of the people, why this victory must depend on the degree of their political consciousness, depend on the understanding between all peoples, depend on the organized united action against colonialism, imperialism, and feudalism.

We especially want to pay tribute to the Chinese people, and we will be faithful messengers of the greetings, affection, and friendship that you have entrusted us to convey to the African peoples. Not only will we remember the memory of such a grand rally in our hearts, but we will also try our best – if we are still worthy of it – not to betray the trust you have shown us, that is to say, to fight the same struggle with you for the same cause.

We express to you that the Republic of Guinea hopes that the leaders of your country's youth organizations, peasant movements, cooperative movements, women's groups, and trade union organizations will visit our country, and they will be welcomed in Guinea. Finally, we want to shout: Long live the peace of the peoples of the world! Long live the friendship and cooperation between countries! Long live the friendship and fraternal cooperation between the Republic of Guinea and the People's Republic of China!

### 在首都各界人民的欢迎大会上  塞古·杜尔总统的讲话

    在首都各界人民的欢迎大会上
    塞古·杜尔总统的讲话
    新华社12日讯　几内亚共和国总统塞古·杜尔在首都各界人民欢迎大会上的讲话，全文如下：
    共和国主席先生阁下，亲爱的朋友、部长们，政治、工会、军事负责人，青年，妇女，亲爱的兄弟们，
    你们的人民群众不断地向几内亚代表团表示的同情、信任和斗争的决心，肯定是向全体进步人类，特别是向为争取自由和民主而斗争的非洲各国人民所表达的，我们代表团只是地球这一部分的象征，它和你们在一起愈来愈勇敢而自觉地进行反对帝国主义的斗争，以便能够通过所有人民的努力来实现我们人类谋求自由、民主和进步的深刻愿望。
    我们知道，自从人类在地球上诞生以来，人们就不断地进行斗争，同自然以及它的各种不同的现象作斗争，以便能够为人类的发展利用自然的资源。人也不断为克服人们的自私自利和恶劣行为而斗争，各国人民目前进行的反帝斗争，使得人类为争取社会、经济和文化的福利而进行的斗争具有更大的价值。非洲所进行的这一斗争，不应该被理解为纯属感情用事，而应该被理解为具有历史渊源的。这种斗争不仅是为了使非洲实现以社会正义为基础的人类社会平等所必需的，而且也是为了使非洲能够同世界上其他各国人民一起在充分友好和充分合作中生活所必需的，从而使每个社会在安全与和平得到保证的情况下，不仅能利用自然财富，而且能利用自己的智力以及物质、道义和文化方面的财富，那样，人类的一切才能将能在最好的条件下得到发挥。
    因此，非洲希望作为一支和平的力量——这支力量是对其他各国人民的一个贡献。在你们的许许多多宏伟的表现中，使我们印象最深的，首先是鼓舞着你们的原则和理想的普遍性质，这种原则和理想同世界各国人民的深切愿望没有任何矛盾，因为像贵国人民一样，非洲人民也希望过完全自由的生活。
    我们同国际帝国主义所代表和体现的罪恶势力不同之处，在于这种势力不是帮助人类重建它的统一，不是帮助人类增加它的知识、促进它在科学和文化方面的成就和改进生活的客观条件和精神条件，也不是使人类能控制自然。相反地，帝国主义要分裂人类，分裂各个民族，分裂同一个国家的人，其目的在于继续推行它的使群众贫困化的剥削和压迫制度。我们的共同政策同帝国主义的政策的区别，恰恰就在于我们的文明、我们的文化、我们的纲领的人道性质，恰恰就在于帝国主义的纲领、帝国主义已经从事的和它仍然打算从事的那些勾当的非人道性。因此，假如正义和非正义之间的斗争、自由和奴役之间的斗争、进步和反动之间的斗争——一方面是觉悟了的各国人民所从事的斗争，另一方面是自私利益集团所进行的斗争继续下去，那末，我们可以断言，不管这相互之间的斗争要持续多久，它只能有一方获得胜利，那就是只能是人民力量的一方获得胜利！人民的力量肩负着维护自由、民主、友爱以及人与人之间和各国人民之间的合作的理想的责任。
    正如你们所知道的，在遭受殖民统治之前，非洲人民本来是有自己的国家的，这些国家是在社会平衡的基础上组织起来的，而且是考虑到自己所拥有的生产手段的。虽然这些手段同西欧某些国家使用的现代化手段比较起来是原始的，可是，我们敢于肯定地说，非洲的经济和社会文明绝不容许为了有钱人的利益而剥夺人民的自由。
    正是殖民统治来强行建立了关于价值的新等级，使金钱超越一切，使非洲社会分裂再分裂，从而瓦解这个社会，在经济、社会和文化各方面用非正义的手段来从事剥削和压迫我们各族人民。可是，帝国主义及其随之而来的殖民主义，妄自声称自己负有文明的使命，而这种文明正是用步枪和大炮屠杀无辜的人，正是实行强迫劳动，正是为了剥削工人群众，正是为了实行种族歧视和文化压迫，最后，这种文明正是为了扼杀非洲的性格，使非洲人不能对自己的事务担负责任，从而造成自卑感。因此，正是帝国主义造成的这些条件——非正义的条件——激起了非洲各国人民的反抗，因为帝国主义者和殖民主义者的种种活动，伤害了非洲各国人民的尊严。
    认识到帝国主义在各国人民生活中造成的非正义现象——这种觉悟也就是非洲革命的主要动力——这就向你们说明了，非洲革命同帝国主义的保持，是根本对立的，非洲在争取政治、经济、社会和文化解放的道路上所取得的每一个进步，都意味着帝国主义的失败。正是因为你们在漫长的岁月中凭着简陋的物质条件，以超人的努力，赶走了帝国主义，正是因为你们走上了各国人民之间友好的道路，走上了建设一个没有任何剥削和压迫的新的人类社会的道路，所以对非洲各国人民来说，不仅是英勇的典范，而且是一支生力军。我们确信，为了争取在管理自己的事务方面负起全部责任而进行同样的革命的所有其他反对帝国主义的人民，将能信任同他们一样属于和平和自由的阵营的非洲各国人民；这些人民之间愈能增进谅解，一致行动组织得愈好，我们的共同斗争将愈能见效；那时，我们大家所时刻关怀的理想：结束帝国主义、结束各式各样的殖民主义、结束封建主义的理想，就能更加迅速地实现。
    在向贵国人民的巨大贡献致敬，并向你们保证非洲大陆将对共同的斗争作出质量愈来愈高的贡献的同时，我们要向你们再说一遍：我们大家将为共同的胜利而进行斗争。走向胜利的道路已经不再是漫长的了，因为在非洲、在亚洲、在美洲、在欧洲，在所有人类社会里，反对帝国主义的力量日益壮大；而随着我们相继获得解放、随着我们反对帝国主义的斗争的力量愈来愈强大，执意要在世界上保持非正义的人们的人数和势力将日益削弱。我们刚才已经说过，胜利属于我们这一边，走向胜利的道路不再是漫长的了，因为我们都认识到：必须消除使我们人类分裂和落后的原因。
    因此，我们的朋友、北京市市长把帝国主义比作豺狼，是非常正确的。诚然：豺狼可以改变它的外表，如果它愿意的话，它可以改变它的语言，如果它愿意的话；它可以改变它的位置，如果它愿意的话；但是它的本性是决计改变不了的，也就是说决计改变不了它对待山羊的行动，尤其在当这些山羊还没有团结起来的时候。
    比如，世界上许多国家的政治家、国家首脑、部长以及政界负责人，他们虽然经常在谈论民主、自由、独立，但是他们却继续阻挠阿尔及利亚的解放、刚果的彻底解放和安哥拉的解放，阻挠自由人民的正常发展。这种情况说明，为什么人民的胜利必须掌握在人民的手中，为什么这种胜利必须取决于他们的政治觉悟的程度，取决于各国人民之间的谅解，取决于反对殖民主义、帝国主义和封建主义的有组织的一致行动。
    我们特别要向中国人民致敬，我们将是你们委托我们转达给非洲各国人民的问候、情意和友谊的忠实信使。不仅我们将把这样盛大的集会的记忆铭记在心，而且我们将尽力——如果我们还当之有愧的话——不辜负你们对我们所表示的这种信任，就是说要和你们在一起为同一个事业而进行同一个斗争。
    我们向你们表示，几内亚共和国希望贵国的青年组织、农民运动、合作化运动、妇女团体和工会组织的负责人到我国访问，他们将在几内亚受到欢迎。最后我们要高呼：世界各国人民和平万岁！各国之间的友好和合作万岁！几内亚共和国和中华人民共和国之间的友谊和兄弟般的合作万岁！
