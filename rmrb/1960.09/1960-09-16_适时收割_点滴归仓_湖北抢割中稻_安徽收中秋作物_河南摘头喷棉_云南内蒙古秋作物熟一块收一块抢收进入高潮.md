Xinhua News Agency reports: Hubei Province is adopting various effective measures in the rush to harvest mid-season rice, meticulously harvesting and threshing to ensure every grain is brought into storage. Currently, 60% of the province's mid-season rice has been harvested.

This year, Hubei Province's mid-season rice area is larger than last year. To ensure timely harvesting and reduce losses, most areas have summarized the experiences of meticulous harvesting and threshing from the summer harvest and made a series of preparations early on.

Based on the experience that "harvesting at 90% ripeness prevents losses at full ripeness," various localities have ranked the ripening degree of mid-season rice plot by plot, distinguishing between early and late ripening to ensure harvesting of each ripened area. In Jingzhou Prefecture, the province's main mid-season rice producing area, 480,000 laborers have been organized and投入into the rush harvesting battle. Sui County, the county with the largest mid-season rice production in Xiangyang Prefecture, has drawn 86,000 people from towns, government offices, enterprises, and other sectors to strengthen the front line of the rush harvest, greatly accelerating the progress of the rush harvest.

Xinhua News Agency reports: Anhui is rushing to harvest mid-season crops such as mid-season rice, corn, sorghum, millet, and soybeans in accordance with the requirement of simultaneous harvesting and threshing. The broad masses of commune members are generally paying attention to meticulous harvesting and threshing in the rush harvest, striving to bring every grain into storage.

Past experience has proven that when harvesting grain crops, simultaneous cutting and threshing, with thorough threshing in one go, can avoid losses caused by delayed threshing, such as scattering or spoilage due to adverse weather. Therefore, various localities are universally promoting a one-stop operation method in the autumn harvest, organizing specialized teams for harvesting, transportation, and threshing to ensure simultaneous harvesting, transportation, and threshing, completing the process in one go. According to statistics from Wuhu, Anqing, and Lu'an Prefectures and the Hefei area, people's communes have organized more than 49,000 specialized harvesting, transportation, and threshing teams, with the participation of more than 1.16 million commune members. Many communes have also implemented a responsibility system and inspection and acceptance system in various specialized teams, further promoting meticulous harvesting and threshing.

Xinhua News Agency reports: Henan Province's cotton has successively begun to boll and mature, and commune members of the people's communes are picking the first flush cotton with joy. As of the 5th, the province had harvested more than 30 million jin of seed cotton. The grade and length of the new cotton have improved by one grade compared to last year, with high lint percentage and few impurities. The seed cotton sold to the state by Yangdian Brigade of Baibi Commune in Anyang County generally reaches grade three, with a绒length of more than one inch, and each hundred jin of seed cotton produces 39.6 jin of lint.

While picking new cotton, various localities continue to carry out pruning, pest control, and increased application of quick-acting fertilizers, strengthening late-stage cotton field management, and striving to harvest more cotton. At present, pest-infested cotton fields in Xinxiang Prefecture have generally been treated, pruned two to three times, and more than 1 million mu have been top-dressed. Cotton fields in Kaifeng Prefecture have generally been top-dressed once and pruned three or four times.

Xinhua News Agency reports: The work of harvesting autumn grain crops has been universally launched on the Yunnan Plateau.

In the autumn harvest, various localities have concentrated 80% of the strong labor force on the front line, according to the characteristics of high temperature, early and consistent ripening of crops, and corresponding increase in harvest volume due to expanded planting area, so that the harvesting work has achieved high quality and high speed, basically achieving harvesting of each ripened area, each ripened field, and reducing scattering and waste compared with previous years. Yuanjiang County in Yuxi Prefecture has concentrated 80% of the labor force to strengthen the autumn harvest front, and the county harvested more than 35,000 mu of rice in a very short time, accounting for more than 34% of the planted area, and achieved harvesting at nine-tenths ripeness, each ripened field harvested.

At present, in addition to the Honghe Hani and Yi Autonomous Prefecture and Simao and other prefectures in the southern region with earlier agricultural seasons that have generally started autumn harvesting, Zhaotong and Qujing Prefectures and Chuxiong Yi Autonomous Prefecture in the central and northeastern regions, which have later seasons, have also fully prepared in terms of ideology, organization, autumn harvesting tools, warehouses, and drying grounds, to welcome the high tide of autumn harvesting.

Xinhua News Agency reports: The Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region has fully started the autumn harvest. According to incomplete statistics as of September 6, the region has cut down more than 19 million mu of various autumn crops. The majority of early autumn crops in Xilingol League and Ulanqab League have been harvested.

This year, the sown area of autumn fields in the autonomous region has expanded by nearly 10 million mu compared to last year. At the same time, the area of intercropping and mixed cropping is also larger than in previous years, and in pastoral areas, in addition to grain crops, there are also several million mu of feed.

While actively improving the harvesting progress in the autumn harvest, various localities are also trying every means to improve the quality of the autumn harvest, so that each ripened area is cut and meticulously harvested, and every grain is brought into storage. Many communes and production teams in Ulanqab League have organized autumn harvest inspection and acceptance teams, implementing a responsibility system of fixed tasks, fixed plots, fixed time, and fixed quality. If unclearly harvested plots are found, auxiliary labor is immediately organized to clean them up. In addition, various localities have widely organized children and the elderly to follow the sickle and the cart to pick up grain, and universally carry out re-harvesting, re-threshing, and re-winnowing. In Liangcheng and Helingeer counties in Ulanqab League alone, more than 190,000 jin of grain were recovered in re-threshing and re-winnowing.

Xinhua News Agency reports: The spring wheat harvest in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region has basically ended. At present, various localities are seizing the time to concentrate on threshing. Areas that have completed threshing are generally carrying out re-threshing, striving to bring every grain of spring wheat into storage.

    适时收割　点滴归仓  湖北抢割中稻
  　安徽收中秋作物　河南摘头喷棉
    云南内蒙古秋作物熟一块收一块抢收进入高潮
    据新华社讯  湖北省在抢割中稻中采取各种有效措施细收细打，力争粒粒归仓。目前全省中稻已收割60％。
    湖北省今年中稻面积比去年大，为了保证按时收割，减少损耗，大多数地区都在总结夏收细收细打经验的基础上，较早地作了一系列的准备工作。
    根据“九成熟收，十成熟丢”的经验，各地都把中稻黄熟程度进行逐块排队，分出先后，保证黄一块割一块。全省主要中稻产区荆州专区，已组织了四十八万劳力投入抢割战斗。襄阳专区产中稻最多的随县，从城镇、机关、企业等各方面抽调出八万六千多人加强抢收第一线，大大加速了抢收进度。
    据新华社讯　安徽各地正在根据收割、脱粒同时并进的要求，抢收中稻、玉米、高粱、谷子和大豆等中秋作物。广大社员在抢收中普遍注意精收细打，力争颗粒归仓。
    以往的经验证明，收获粮食作物时，边割边打，一次脱粒干净，可以避免因脱粒不及时而造成的抛撒或遇到灾害性天气而发生的霉烂等损失。因此，各地在秋收中普遍推广了一条龙作业法，组织收割、运输、脱粒专业队，使收割、运输、脱粒同时并进，一气呵成。据芜湖、安庆、六安三个专区和合肥地区统计，各人民公社共组织收、运、脱粒专业队四万九千多个，参加的社员有一百一十六万多人。很多公社在各专业队中还推行了责任制和检查验收制度，进一步促进了细收细打。
    据新华社讯　河南省的棉花已陆续吐絮成熟，人民公社的社员们正满怀着喜悦的心情，采摘头喷棉。到5日止，全省已经采摘了三千多万斤籽棉。新棉的品级和长度都比去年提高了一个等级，而且衣分高、杂质少。安阳县白璧公社杨店大队卖给国家的籽棉，品级一般达到三级，绒长一吋多，每百斤籽棉出皮棉三十九点六斤。
    在采摘新棉的同时，各地还继续进行整枝、治虫、增施速效肥料，加强棉田后期管理，力争多收棉花。目前新乡专区发生虫害的棉田已普遍进行了防治，整枝两遍到三遍，后期追肥的已有一百多万亩。开封专区的棉田已经普遍追了一遍肥，打杈三、四遍。
    据新华社讯　云南高原收割秋季粮食作物的工作已普遍展开。
    各地在秋收中，根据气温高，庄稼成熟提早和成熟一致以及由于扩大播种面积收获量相应增加等特点，都集中了80％的精壮劳力上阵，使收获工作达到了高质量、高速度，基本上做到了黄一片收一片，熟一丘收一丘，而且比往年减少了抛撒浪费。玉溪专区的元江县因集中80％的劳力加强了秋收战线，全县在很短时间内就收割了三万五千多亩水稻，占种植面积的34％强，并且做到了九黄十收，熟一丘收一丘。
    目前，全省除农事季节较早的南部红河哈尼族彝族自治州和思茅等专区普遍开始秋收以外，季节较迟的中部和东北部的昭通、曲靖专区和楚雄彝族自治州等地，也都全面地从思想、组织和秋收工具、仓库、晒场等方面进行了充分准备，迎接秋收高潮。
    据新华社讯　内蒙古自治区已全面开始秋收。据到9月6日的不完全统计，全区已割倒各种秋季作物一千九百多万亩。锡林郭勒盟和乌兰察布盟的大部早秋作物已经割完。
    今年，自治区秋田播种面积比去年扩大近一千万亩。同时，间种混种的面积也比往年大，在牧区除粮食作物外，还有几百万亩饲料。
    各地在秋收中积极提高收割进度的同时，也千方百计提高秋收质量，做到熟一块，割一块，精打细收，颗粒归仓。乌兰察布盟很多公社、生产队组织了秋收检查验收组，实行定任务、定地块、定时间、定质量的责任制，发现收割不净的地块，立即组织辅助劳力拾净。此外，各地还广泛组织儿童、老人跟镰、跟车拾粮，并普遍进行复收、复打、复扬，仅乌兰察布盟凉城和和林格尔两县在复打复扬中，就多收回粮食十九万斤。
    据新华社讯　内蒙古自治区春小麦收割已经基本结束。目前各地正抓紧时间突击打场。已打完场的地区普遍进行复打，力争春麦颗粒归仓。
