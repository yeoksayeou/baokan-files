Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, August 31st: The People's Liberation Army troops stationed in Liaoning Province recently commended a group of heroic units and individuals who were brave and selfless in flood fighting and rescue.

When parts of Liaoning were hit by floods in early August, all the troops stationed in the province went all out and stood at the forefront of the flood fighting and rescue struggle, turning many areas from danger to safety. The Efang Dam outside the East Gate of Liaoyang City had a dangerous section, and because the equipment could not be supplied in time, it was about to burst. Hundreds of officers and soldiers who arrived from afar immediately jumped into the water and built a human dam along the embankment, blocking the impact of the flood. Subsequently, the troops dispatched trucks to transport a large number of materials, quickly raising the dam by one meter and ensuring the safety of the entire city of Liaoyang. The Gaolimen Dam on the Taizi River experienced leakage at the dam's foot twice. Yu Yaosheng, deputy director of the political department of a certain unit, led more than 500 officers and soldiers to arrive in time. They dived into the water several times and plugged the leaks outside the dam. Officers and soldiers of a certain unit rushed to a village surrounded by floods and rescued more than 400 people, as well as grain and livestock, to a safe area in the face of storms. During this period, air force flight personnel insisted on flying day and night under adverse weather conditions to airdrop relief supplies to the disaster areas. A certain maritime transportation team also came to the forefront of flood control, overcoming difficulties such as unfamiliarity with inland waterway transportation, and rescued a large number of victims and materials. These units have been commended and rewarded by the troop leadership.

The officers and soldiers who were commended demonstrated the noble character of the people's soldiers in loving the people and acting bravely for a just cause. Ren Hongxuan, a squad leader of a certain unit, and Du Xican, a deputy squad leader, and others, suddenly found people floating in the flood while carrying out rescue operations in a village. They immediately jumped into the rapids to rescue them. The water was high and the waves were strong. They tried several times to lift the victims out of the water, but were pushed down by the waves. When they rescued the people ashore, they were washed away by a rapid current for more than eighty miles. They escaped danger only after a day and a night of tenacious struggle.

After the flood situation improved, the troops then devoted themselves to disaster relief and helping the disaster areas to restore production. The heroic actions of the People's Liberation Army in fighting floods and providing disaster relief deeply moved the people in the disaster areas. They expressed to the soldiers that they would learn from the heroic and fearless spirit of the People's Liberation Army and quickly restore and develop production. (Attached photo)

    学习解放军英勇无畏的精神
    驻辽宁部队表扬一批抗洪抢险英雄人物
    据新华社沈阳31日电　中国人民解放军驻辽宁部队，最近表扬了一批在抗洪抢险中英勇无畏、舍己为人的英雄单位和英雄人物。
    8月初辽宁部分地区遭到洪水袭击时，全省驻军全力以赴，始终站在抗洪抢险斗争的最前列，使许多地区转危为安。辽阳市东门外峨房大坝有处险工，因为器材一时供应不上，眼看就要决口，远道赶到的数百名官兵，立即跳入水中，沿大坝筑成人堤，挡住了洪水的冲击。接着，部队又派出汽车，运来大批器材，迅速把大坝加高一米，保住了整个辽阳市的安全。太子河高丽门大坝两次出现坝脚漏水的险情，某部政治部副主任于耀升率领五百多名官兵及时赶到，他们几次潜入水底，堵住了坝外漏洞。某部官兵赶到了一个被洪水包围的村庄，冒着暴风雨把全村四百多人和粮食、牲畜全部抢救到安全地带。这期间，空军飞行人员日夜在恶劣的气象条件下坚持飞行，为灾区空投救灾物资。某海上运输大队也来到抗洪前线，多次克服内河航运不熟悉等的困难，抢救出大批灾民和物资。这些单位都分别受到了部队领导机关的表扬和奖励。
    受到表扬的官兵们，表现了人民战士热爱人民、见义勇为的高贵品德。某部班长任洪轩、副班长杜希灿等在一个村庄里抢险时，忽然发现洪水里漂过人，他们立即跳入激流，前往营救。水大浪高，他们几次把落难者托出水面，又都被浪头打下去。当他们把人救上岸时，自己却被一股激流冲出八十多里，经过一天一夜的顽强搏斗方才脱险。
    水情好转后，各部队接着又投入了救灾和帮助灾区恢复生产的工作。解放军抗洪抢险的英雄行为，使灾区人民深受感动。他们向战士们表示，要学习解放军英勇无畏的精神，迅速恢复和发展生产。（附图片）
