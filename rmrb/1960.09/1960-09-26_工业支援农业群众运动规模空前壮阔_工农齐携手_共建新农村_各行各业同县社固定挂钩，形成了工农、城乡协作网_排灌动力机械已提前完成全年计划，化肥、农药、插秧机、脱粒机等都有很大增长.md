Xinhua News Agency, September 25th: Under the guidance of the policy of taking agriculture as the foundation of the national economy, a mass movement of industry supporting agriculture, unprecedented in scale, has been launched on China's industrial front this year. This mass movement has undergone many important developments compared with the past in terms of scale, form, and content. Its characteristics are: from the past support of a raid-like, seasonal nature, it has developed into regular, comprehensive support; from the actions of a few units, it has developed into the actions of the vast masses of the entire industrial sector; from the individual connections of one factory and one commune, it has developed into a network of urban-rural cooperation with all sectors fixedly linked to counties and communes. In terms of the content of support, it has also developed from helping to do a good job in current production to helping counties and communes realize long-term plans centered on mechanization, water conservancy, and electrification. In the past few months, the number of factories and mines involved in the movement, and the breadth of industries, have reached an unprecedented scale.

China's large-scale industrial support for agriculture movement is composed of forces from two aspects. On the one hand, the state actively takes measures to develop the production of agricultural means of production, especially to strengthen the production of agricultural machinery; on the other hand, factories, enterprises, and the vast number of workers provide technical support to agriculture in many ways.

At the beginning of this year, the state listed the production of agricultural means of production as an important task of the industrial sector, and the state specially allocated a large amount of steel to produce agricultural machinery. The national consumption of steel for agriculture in the first half of this year was equivalent to the consumption of steel for agriculture in the entire year of 1959. Various localities have also designated a considerable number of factories to specialize in the production of agricultural machinery; the central and local industrial leading departments have also taken many measures to accelerate the progress of basic construction projects serving agricultural production; tractor factories, agricultural machinery factories, fertilizer factories, and pesticide factories across the country have also launched vigorous movements to increase production and practice economy and technical revolution. Therefore, the output of various products for agricultural production from these industrial sectors this year has greatly exceeded that of any previous year. As of the end of August, the output of power machinery for agricultural irrigation and drainage was 118.5% of the same period last year, and agricultural pumps were 107.4%. The production of these two items has completed the annual national plan ahead of schedule. Motorized threshers increased by 4.4 times compared with the same period last year, chemical pesticides increased by 82.2%, chemical fertilizers increased by 1.2 times, and rice transplanters, pig-raising machinery, etc. also increased several times. Many agricultural machines, after product revolution, have reduced material consumption and increased efficiency, making them more suitable for the characteristics of agricultural production in our country and have been warmly welcomed by commune members.

While the state vigorously develops the production of agricultural means of production, all regions and industrial sectors across the country have launched a mass movement to support agriculture with unprecedented scale and rich content. A moving scene of "workers and peasants joining hands to build a new socialist countryside" has emerged in the vast urban and rural areas. During the movement, thousands of technicians and workers went to the countryside and fields, worked alongside farmers, helped repair machines, taught technology, and also participated in rush harvesting and planting during the busy season. Some large factories set up "amateur small factories" to support agriculture, and workers used their spare time and waste materials to produce agricultural implements for their peasant brothers. In particular, the method of "factory-commune linkage," which has been widely promoted and continuously developed and improved in various localities, has played a very significant role in supporting agricultural technological transformation and has become an important form of current industrial support for agriculture in our country. At present, many regions have formed huge worker-peasant, urban-rural cooperation networks. Liaoning Province has more than 2,100 factories, mines, transportation, postal and telecommunications enterprises linked to more than 460 people's communes throughout the province, with one to several enterprises responsible for supporting each commune. In Anhui Province, more than 80% of factories and mines are linked to 90% of the people's communes in the province. In Jiangsu Province, more than 7,600 large and small factories and mining enterprises have participated in the linkage to support agriculture. Industrial departments in large cities such as Shanghai, Tianjin, and Beijing have also linked up with suburban counties and communes, providing strong support to agriculture in terms of equipment, technology, and manpower.

The form of "factory-commune linkage" in various localities has undergone many new developments and creations on the basis of the original one factory to one commune. Some counties and cities in Liaoning, Anhui, Guangdong, Hebei, and other provinces have created the method of pairing large and small factories to form groups, or uniting small factories to link up with one or several communes, using collective strength to support agriculture, which facilitates enterprise division of labor and cooperation, adjusting surpluses and shortages, and concentrating efforts to solve major key problems for the communes. For example, Anqing City, Anhui Province, with the agricultural machinery factory as the backbone, paired 96 factories to form 9 agricultural support "cooperation groups," which were linked to 9 key communes in the suburbs of the city and 6 counties including Huaining and Guichi. When the industrial departments of Hefei City rushed to manufacture irrigation and drainage machinery for the countryside, they organized 18 factories to jointly produce, with each factory giving full play to its strengths, exchanging what they had for what they needed, and rushed to manufacture 40,000 horsepower of irrigation and drainage machinery for supply to the countryside in a very short time.

Some cities in Sichuan, Gansu, Shanxi, and other provinces have further developed "factory-commune linkage" into "factory-county linkage," making the scope of industrial support for agriculture wider and the scale larger. Sichuan Province mainly uses large or medium-sized factories with strong machinery manufacturing capabilities, unites several factories and industrial schools, and then links up with counties according to the principle of large factories contracting large counties, medium-sized factories contracting medium-sized counties, and small factories contracting small counties. At present, more than 4,600 factories (including industrial schools) across the province have signed long-term support contracts with counties. After Chengdu Measuring & Cutting Tool Factory signed a contract to support agriculture with Jianyang County, it has begun to help the county establish an agricultural machinery manufacturing and repair system from the county, district to the commune, help them transform iron smelting plants, cement plants, and expand power plants.

On the basis of factory-commune and factory-county linkages, some cities in Henan, Jiangsu, Liaoning, and other provinces have recently formed "coordination associations" or "committees" to support agriculture with industrial departments as the backbone, and these "associations" are linked to counties and communes. This makes the force to support agriculture stronger and the participating units more extensive.

Through the above-mentioned developments, some important products produced through factory-commune linkage have been gradually included in the national plan, thus transforming scattered and spontaneous mutual support into an organized and planned mass movement.

With the development of the mass movement of industrial support for agriculture, the relationship between workers and peasants has become closer. Many workers, through going to the countryside and communes, have deeply realized the responsibility of the working class in accelerating agricultural technological transformation. Some workers said, "Workers and peasants are one family, and workers have a great responsibility to realize agricultural mechanization." Therefore, supporting agriculture has become a conscious action of many workers. The workers of Chengdu Measuring & Cutting Tool Factory regard the Qinglong Commune, which is linked to them, as the factory's "relatives." In addition to actively completing the support tasks stipulated in the contract, the workers go to the commune to "visit relatives" whenever they have free time, inquiring eagerly about what is lacking and what needs to be repaired. Once, workers in Measuring Tool Group One discovered while "visiting relatives" that the commune's water still had to be fetched from the stream under the slope. When they returned to the factory, they immediately rushed to manufacture a water pump for the commune overnight and delivered it to the commune three days later. The selfless labor spirit of workers in many areas when they went to the countryside to support agriculture has greatly educated the broad masses of peasants. The agricultural technology support team sent by Xi'an Switch Rectifier Factory to Yulin Prefecture fought drought alongside the peasants during the day, and repaired agricultural machinery and ran training classes during the evening to train technical forces for the countryside. After completing the task in one area, they immediately rushed to another area and worked continuously for more than a month. Encouraged by the worker brothers, the broad masses of commune members are more confident, and they are determined to use greater efforts to realize the plan of agricultural technological transformation and change the face of the countryside as soon as possible.

    新华社25日讯　在国民经济以农业为基础的方针指导下，今年我国工业战线上掀起了一个规模空前的工业支援农业的群众运动。这个群众运动无论在规模、形式和内容方面比过去有很多重要的发展。它的特点是：从过去带突击性、季节性的支援，发展为经常的、全面的支援；从少数单位的行动，发展为整个工业部门广大群众的行动，从一厂一社的个别联系，发展为各行各业同县、社固定挂钩的城乡协作网。在支援的内容上，也从帮助搞好当前生产，发展到帮助县、社实现以机械化、水利化、电气化为中心的长远规划。几个月来，投入运动的厂矿、人员之多，行业之广，都达到了空前未有的规模。
    我国规模巨大的工业支援农业的运动，是由两个方面的力量组成的，一方面是国家积极采取措施发展农业生产资料的生产，特别是加强农业机械的生产；一方面是各工厂企业和广大职工，从多方面对农业进行技术支援。
    今年一开始，国家就把农业生产资料的生产列为工业部门的重要任务，国家专门调拨了大批钢材来生产农业机械。今年上半年全国用于农业方面的钢材消费量，相当于1959年全年农业用钢材的消费量。各地又划出了数量相当大的一批工厂专门生产农业机械；中央和各地有关工业领导部门还采取很多措施，加速了为农业生产服务的基本建设工程的进度；全国各地的拖拉机厂、农业机械厂、化肥厂、农药厂也开展了声势浩大的增产节约和技术革命运动。因此，今年这些工业部门为农业生产的各种产品的产量，都大大超过了以往任何一年。截至8月底，农业排灌用的动力机械的产量为去年同期的118.5％，农业用泵为107.4％，这两项产品都已提前完成全年的国家计划。机动脱粒机比去年同期增长四点四倍，化学农药增长82.2％，化肥增长一点二倍，水稻插秧机、养猪机械等也是成倍地增长。许多农业机械经过产品革命后，用料减少，效率提高，更加适合于我国农业生产的特点，受到社员群众的热烈欢迎。
    在国家大力发展农业生产资料生产的同时，全国各地区、各个工业行业展开了规模空前壮阔、内容丰富多彩的支援农业的群众运动。广大城乡出现了一片“工农齐携手，共建新农村”的动人景象。运动中，成千上万的技术工人下乡、下田，和农民并肩劳动，帮助修机器，教技术，在特忙时还参加抢收抢种。有的大工厂举办支援农业的“业余小工厂”，工人们利用业余时间和废料来为农民弟兄生产农业机具。特别是各地普遍推广并且不断发展和提高了“厂社挂钩”的办法，对支援农业技术改造起了十分显著的作用，成为当前我国工业支援农业的一种重要形式。目前许多地区已经形成了庞大的工农、城乡协作网。辽宁省有二千一百多个工厂矿山、交通邮电等企业分别和全省的四百六十多个人民公社挂了钩，每个公社都有一个到几个企业负责支援。安徽省已有80％以上的厂矿和全省90％的人民公社挂了钩。江苏省参加挂钩支援农业的大小厂矿企业达到七千六百多个。上海、天津、北京等大城市的工业部门也分别与郊区县、社挂钩，从设备、技术、人力等方面给农业以强有力的支援。
    各地“厂社挂钩”的形式，在原来一厂对一社的基础上有很多新的发展和创造。辽宁、安徽、广东、河北等省的一些县市，创造了大小厂搭配编组，或把小厂联合起来与一个或数个公社挂钩，用集体力量支援农业的办法，这样便于企业分工协作，调剂有无，集中力量为公社解决重大关键问题。如安徽省安庆市以农业机械厂为骨干，把九十六个工厂搭配组成九个支援农业“合作小组”，分别与市郊及怀宁、贵池等六个县的九个重点公社挂了钩。合肥市工业部门在为农村赶制排灌机械时，把十八个工厂组织起来联合生产，各厂发挥所长，互通有无，很短时间内就赶制出了四万马力的排灌机械供应了农村。
    四川、甘肃、山西等省的一些城市，进一步把“厂社挂钩”发展成“厂县挂钩”，使工业支援农业的范围更广，规模更大。四川省以机械制造能力较强的大厂或中等厂为主，联合若干工厂和工业学校，然后按照大厂包大县、中厂包中等县、小厂包小县的原则，同县挂钩。目前全省已有四千六百多个工厂（包括工业学校）同县签订了长期支援的合同。成都量具刃具厂同简阳县签订支援农业的合同后，已经开始帮助这个县建立从县、区到公社的农业机械制造修配体系，帮助他们改造炼铁厂、水泥厂和扩建发电厂。
    在厂社、厂县挂钩的基础上，河南、江苏、辽宁等省的一些城市最近又以工业部门为骨干，组成了城市各行各业支援农业的“协作会”或“委员会”，由这些“会”同县、社对口挂钩。这样就使支援农业的力量更加壮大，参加的单位更加广泛。
    经过上述这些发展，通过厂社挂钩所生产的一些重要产品已逐步列入国家计划之内，这样就使零散的自发的互相支援，发展成为有组织有计划的群众运动。
    随着工业支援农业群众运动的发展，工农关系更加亲密。许多工人通过下乡、下社，更深刻地体会到在加速农业技术改造中工人阶级的责任。有的工人说，“一根藤上两个瓜，工人农民是一家，农业实现机械化，我们工人责任大。”因此，支援农业成为很多工人的自觉行动。成都量具刃具厂职工把和他们挂钩的青龙公社当作工厂的“亲戚”，工人们除积极完成合同内规定的支援任务外，一有空闲就到公社去“走亲戚”，殷切地询问缺少什么，要修什么。有一次，量具一组的工人在“走亲戚”时发现，公社的水还要从坡下的小溪里挑来吃，他们回到厂里，马上连夜为公社赶制了一部抽水机，三天之后就送到公社。许多地区的工人在下乡支援农业时的忘我劳动的工作精神，使广大农民受到很大的教育。西安开关整流器厂派到榆林专区的农业技术支援队，白天和农民一道抗旱，晚上休息时检修农业机械，办训练班，为农村培养技术力量，一个地区完成了任务，马上赶到另一个地区，连续工作了一个多月。在工人兄弟的鼓舞下，广大社员信心更足，他们决心用更大的努力实现农业技术改造的规划，尽快地改变农村面貌。
