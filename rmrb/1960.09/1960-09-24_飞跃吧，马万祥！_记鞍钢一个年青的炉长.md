Leap Forward, Ma Wanxiang!
——Remembering a Young Furnace Chief at Anshan Iron and Steel
Jiang Deming
　　That fascinating, boiling night came again to Anshan Iron and Steel...

　　The gas pipes above people's heads still hissed with heart-stirring sounds, the train whistles, the rumbling of huge cranes, seemed to be even louder than during the day. And the smoke and fire were more colorful than during the day. The furnace fire reddened the night sky, it seemed so magical, magnificent, yet so rich and full of power! If you are fortunate enough to stand here, you will definitely feel that our motherland is growing stronger in this fire and commotion.

　　After dinner, the steelworkers gathered in the auditorium in groups of three or five to listen to the report from the steel plant's Party Committee Secretary conveying the Central Committee's call for increased production and thrift.

　　Ma Wanxiang, the furnace chief of Class A, and his partners from Open Hearth Furnace No. 18 were rushing to repair the furnace. Other steelmaking furnaces were burning with roaring flames, humming with intense heat. Before long, the sound of the People's Daily editorial being read aloud also came from the workshop loudspeaker.

　　Although the loudspeaker's speech was constantly drowned out by the roar of the cranes and the bells and whistles of steel tapping, as well as the clamor of the people, from the excited and passionate expression on Ma Wanxiang's face, one could see what kind of impact the Party's call was having in the heart of a steelworker. As soon as the broadcast stopped, Ma Wanxiang had already discussed with all his furnace brothers the specific actions to respond to the Party's call. He ran to the broadcast room and shouted in a gruff voice: "All comrades of our No. 18 furnace, enthusiastically respond to the Party's call, we must find ways to produce more steel, we will repair the furnace two days ahead of schedule, and we will use this condition to start a 'challenge competition' with the brothers of the 'Youth Unity Furnace'." This short speech stirred the entire workshop, and the comrades of the brother furnaces became restless. In a moment, the people from the "Youth Unity Furnace" had already run to the broadcast room, officially accepting the challenge competition proposed by Ma Wanxiang.

　　It was truly a lively night, red flags and good news flew in the workshop, and the sound of gongs and drums intertwined with the clamor beside the steelmaking furnaces. Ma Wanxiang repaired the furnace with his comrades for a while, and then took the brothers from his own furnace to support the steel-tapping furnaces. Later, Furnace No. 19 challenged Furnace No. 16; Furnace No. 12 challenged Furnace No. 14. For a time, people participating in the challenge competition lined up in the broadcast room, vying to pour out the wishes of steelworkers to this extraordinary night.

　　At dawn, the workers of Class B came to take over, and they caught up with the summary and evaluation meeting of this challenge competition. This night of competition in the open hearth workshop finally ended with a complete victory, and the Class B workers also expressed on the spot that they would enthusiastically continue this competition.

　　When people walked out of the workshop platform, their faces were still beaming with smiles, and the dawn was draped all over them.

　　In the summer of 1956, a nineteen-year-old young man came to Anshan Iron and Steel from Haicheng County. He was determined to be a steelworker, but upon arrival, he was assigned to the ingot casting workshop as an inspector. Although he had always done a good job as an inspector, his heart was still set on wielding a steel bar. Especially after he had worked at Anshan Iron and Steel for a period of time, when he deeply understood the contribution of a steelworker to the country, his determination became even greater. Several times he stretched out his arms to show the Party Committee Secretary of the workshop how strong he was, and that he was tall enough at one meter and seventy centimeters to be a steelworker.

　　In July 1958, he finally got his wish. The ingot casting workshop accepted the young man's request and transferred him to the open hearth workshop. Before leaving, the branch secretary said to him: "You are the one who insisted on going. Working in an open hearth is much more intense, tiring, and hotter than here. You must work hard when you go, and you must bring glory to our workshop!" The young man looked at the branch secretary with deep affection and nodded silently. In this way, he began to be a true steelworker. This young man is precisely Ma Wanxiang, who has now grown into the furnace chief of the "Five Good Furnace".

　　At first, Ma Wanxiang only did some odd jobs, sweeping the floor on the platform, carrying slag, or running errands, but he was very at ease, very willing to do these things, and asked the old workers this and that with great interest, rushing to do the work, making people feel that he was so sincere, such a young man full of a strong sense of purpose.

　　The master workers liked such diligent people, and they gradually allowed him to approach the furnace with peace of mind. Ma Wanxiang did not let go of such a good opportunity, he picked up the steel bar for the first time with a very solemn feeling, he pulled down the blue glasses in front of his cap, and inserted the steel bar into the furnace... "Work, young man, don't be afraid, there is the Party, there are us old workers!" This voice did not only come from one person's mouth. At this moment and countless times later, when Ma Wanxiang practiced operations diligently in front of the furnace, this kind encouragement always lingered beside him, this is the power the Party gave to Ma Wanxiang.

　　Ma Wanxiang is a thoughtful person, he knows that the country needs steel, and the Party wants to quickly train him to be a skilled steelworker, how can he be stingy with his wisdom and energy. He comes to work early every day to learn some experience from the workers of the previous shift; he leaves work later than others for a while in order to ask the people taking over for some technology. After several months, he was familiar with a set of open hearth production techniques, and the leaders let him be the second assistant to the furnace chief. He said that this is not his own ability, this is the masters pushing him to this position.

　　To strive to produce more steel, we must find ways to smelt it quickly. Ma Wanxiang thought of every possible way according to the Party's instructions, and once shortened the tapping time to the shortest, creating a record of tapping the ingot in twelve minutes, while in the past it always took about an hour. In order to maintain the furnace well and extend the life of the furnace, they had to often blow away the ash on the top of the furnace, so as to avoid the ash from becoming too thick and unable to dissipate heat easily causing accidents. However, going to the top of the furnace requires overcoming high temperatures of seventy to eighty degrees. Our Ma Wanxiang thought: I am a young and strong young man, if I don't go up first, who will! He put on his work clothes, wrapped his head and face with a wet towel, and was the first to climb up! It was in this selfless and leading labor that he was promoted to be the first assistant to the furnace chief.

　　In May of this year, he and Lan Degui, the furnace chief of the "Youth Unity Furnace," performed a rapid steelmaking performance competition in several brother factories in Anshan for more than a month. At that time, he performed as the first assistant, and Lan Degui performed as the furnace chief. After returning from the performance, the leaders appointed him as the furnace chief of Class A of the No. 18 furnace. It is rare in the past for a young man with such a short steelmaking history to grow into a skilled furnace chief who is independently responsible so quickly. Ma Wanxiang is writing a brand new chapter with his leaping steps.

　　In the past few years, Ma Wanxiang has been rated as a pacesetter in the factory every month, and an advanced producer every quarter. Last year, he joined the Party, and this year he was elected as a labor model of the city. In the first seven months of this year, Ma Wanxiang and his No. 18 furnace have always been the highest in the factory in overfulfilling the state plan. Since Ma Wanxiang came to Anshan Iron and Steel, he has never stopped flying!

　　The bell for tapping the steel rang again and again, and furnaces of silvery steel flowed out. Like rivers flowing day and night, our Ma Wanxiang and his partners stood proudly in the firelight of splashing steel flowers like countless huge sculptures, they are fighting to pour out more steel for each furnace!

　　Leap forward, Ma Wanxiang and all the people of Anshan Iron and Steel, we are attentively listening to every new message of victory coming from the steel capital.

　　飞跃吧，马万祥！
　　——记鞍钢一个年青的炉长
　　姜德明
    那迷人的、沸腾的夜晚又来到了鞍钢……
    在人们头顶上的煤气管仍然发着震人心弦的咝咝声，火车汽笛的鸣叫声，巨大的吊车的隆隆声，好像比白天更加震响了。而那烟雾和火光也比白天更富有色彩了。炉火映红了夜空，它显得那么神奇、富丽，却又那么丰富和充满了力量！你只要有幸来到这里站上一站，你一定会觉得我们的祖国就在这火光和喧腾声中壮大起来了。
    晚饭以后，炼钢工人们三五成群地都往大礼堂集中，人们去听钢厂党委书记传达中央关于增产节约号召的报告。
    甲班炉长马万祥和他的十八号平炉的伙伴们正在班上抢修炉子，别的炼钢炉正燃烧着熊熊的炉火，嗡嗡地发出了炽烈的响声。不一会，车间广播器里也传来了朗读《人民日报》社论的声音。
    虽然这时广播器里的讲话声正不断被吊车的轰隆声和出钢时的钟声、哨声，以及人们的喧嚷声所盖过，但人们从马万祥脸上露出的兴奋激越的颜色上，可以看出党的号召，在一个炼钢工人的心中正产生怎样的影响。广播声刚住，马万祥已经跟他全炉的弟兄商量好了响应党的号召的具体行动。他跑到广播室里粗声粗气地喊道：“咱们十八号炉的全体同志，热烈地响应党的号召，一定想办法多生产钢铁，我们要提前两天修好炉子，并且就以这个条件要跟‘青年团结炉’的弟兄们展开叫号赛。”这简短的讲话激荡了整个车间，兄弟炉的战友们骚动了。特别是‘青年团结炉’的人们更沉不住气。片刻之间，“青年团结炉”的人已经跑上广播室，正式接受了马万祥提出的叫号赛。
    这真是一个热闹的夜晚，红旗和喜报在车间里飞舞着，锣鼓声和炼钢炉旁的喧闹声交响在一起了。马万祥一会儿和同伴们修炉，一会儿又带着自己炉子上的弟兄们去支援出钢的炉子。后来19号炉又叫了16号炉；12号炉又跟14号炉叫了号，一时广播室里参加叫号赛的人都排成了队，大家抢着要把钢铁工人的心愿倾诉给这个不平凡的夜晚。
    黎明时分，乙班工人来接班，他们还赶上了参加这场叫号赛的总结、评比会。平炉车间的这个竞赛的夜晚最后是以获得全面胜利而结束了，而乙班工人也当场表示，要热火地把这个竞赛继续下去。
    人们从车间平台上走出来的时候，脸上还都泛着笑容，曙光披满了他们全身。
        ＊　＊　＊
    1956年夏天，从海城县到鞍钢来了个十九岁的小伙子。他一心想作一个炼钢工人，不想一来就被分配到铸锭车间作了检查员。虽然他检查员的工作一直作得很好，但他的心还挂记着拿钢钎这件事。特别是他在鞍钢工作了一个时期以后，当他深刻地理解到一个炼钢工人对国家的贡献，他的这种决心就更大了。有几次他伸着自己的胳膊给车间的党委书记看，说自己的力量有多大，个头也足有一米七，作个炼钢工人是够格的了。
    1958年7月，他终于如愿以偿。铸锭车间接受了这个青年的要求，调他到平炉车间去。临走以前，支部书记跟他说：“这可是你自己抢着要去的。在平炉工作比我们这里要紧张，要累，要热得多，你去了可要好好地干，你要给咱车间增光！”年青人满怀深情地望着支部书记，默默地点着头。就这样，他开始作了一个真正的炼钢工人。这个年青人，正是今天已经成长为“五好炉”炉长的马万祥。
    开头，马万祥作的只是一些打杂的零活儿，在平台上扫扫地、抬抬渣子或是跑跑腿，但是他很安心，很乐意作这些事，并且满有兴趣地向老工人问这问那，抢着干活，让人感到他是这么诚恳，是这么一个充满了强烈的事业心的小伙子。
    老师傅们就是喜欢这样勤快的人，他们慢慢放心地让他接近炉子了。马万祥没有放过这样的好机会，他第一次以一种非常庄严的感情，用力地拿起了钢钎，他拉了拉帽沿前边的蓝色的眼镜，把钢钎插进了炉膛……“干吧，小伙子，不要怕，有党，有我们这些老工人呢！”这声音不只是从一个人的口里传出来，此刻和以后无数次，当马万祥兢兢业业地在炉前练习操作的时候，在他的身边总是缭绕着这亲切的鼓励的声音，这是党给马万祥的力量。
    马万祥是个有心的人，他知道国家正需要钢，党要很快地把他培养成一个熟练的炼钢工人，他怎么会吝啬自己的智慧和精力呢。他天天提前来上班，为了要跟上一班的工人们学些经验；下班以后比别人晚走一会儿，为了好跟接班的人再请教些技术。这样过了几个月，他算是熟悉了平炉生产的一套技术了，领导上就让他作了炉长的第二助手。他说这不算是自己的能耐，这是师傅们把他推上这个岗位的。
    要争取生产更多的钢，就得想办法快速地炼。马万祥按照党的吩咐想尽了办法，曾经把出流子的时间缩到最短，创造了十二分钟出完流子的纪录，而过去总要费一个小时左右的。为了维护好炉子，延长炉子的寿命，他们得经常把炉顶上的灰吹掉，免得灰厚了无法散热容易出事故。可是，上炉顶得要战胜七、八十度的高温。我们的马万祥想到：我是个年青力壮的小伙子，咱不先上等谁呢！他把工作服穿戴好，用湿手巾围好头脸，第一个攀上去！就在他这样忘我地带头劳动中，他又被提升为炉长的第一助手。
    今年5月，他和“青年团结炉”的炉长蓝德贵在鞍钢几个兄弟厂作了一个多月的快速炼钢表演赛。那时，他表演第一助手，蓝德贵表演炉长。表演归来之后，领导上又任命他为十八号炉的甲班炉长了。一个炼钢历史这么短的小伙子，这样快地成长为一个独立负责的熟练的炉长，这在过去还是不多的。马万祥正用他飞跃的脚步，写下他那崭新的篇章。
    几年来，马万祥月月被评为全厂的标兵，季季被评为先进生产者，去年参加了党，今年又被选为市的劳动模范。在今年前七个月中，马万祥和他的十八号炉一直是全厂超额完成国家计划最高的一个。马万祥自从来到了鞍钢，就没有停止过飞翔！
    出钢的钟声又接连地敲响了，一炉炉发着银光的钢水倾流出来了，它像江河之水日夜奔流，我们的马万祥和他的伙伴们像无数个巨大的雕塑似的骄傲地站在钢花四溅的火光里，他们正在为每个炉子奔泻出更多的钢水而战！
    飞跃吧，马万祥和所有的鞍钢人，我们正关心地谛听着从钢都传来的每一个新的胜利的消息。
