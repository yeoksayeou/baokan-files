Xinhua News Agency, 10th — Chairman Liu Shaoqi's speech at the state banquet in honor of President Touré is as follows:
    Your Excellency President Sékou Touré, distinguished guests of the Guinean Government Delegation, comrades, friends:
    We are very pleased to have His Excellency Sékou Touré, the outstanding African statesman, leader of the Guinean people, and President of the Republic of Guinea, and other distinguished guests of the Guinean Government Delegation travel from afar to visit our country, bringing with them the precious friendship of the Guinean people and the African people to the Chinese people. On behalf of the Chinese people, I would like to express my warm welcome and heartfelt gratitude.
    President Touré is a national hero of Guinea. He dedicated himself to the cause of national independence of the Guinean people very early on, and led the Guinean people in a long and unyielding struggle against French colonialism, finally winning Guinea's independence and freedom. In the short period since Guinea's independence, President Touré has led the Guinean people in thwarting many subversive conspiracies by imperialism, carried out effective struggles to eliminate the remnants of colonialism and develop the national economy, and made positive contributions to strengthening the unity of the Asian and African peoples, opposing imperialism and safeguarding world peace. The great victory of the Guinean people has greatly encouraged the struggle of the people of African countries against colonialism and for national independence, and accelerated the collapse of the imperialist colonial system in Africa. The Chinese people have always regarded the victory of the Guinean people as their own victory, and the achievements of the Guinean people as their own achievements. We express our great admiration for the heroic Guinean people.
    Friends, comrades, since the invasion of the African continent by Western colonialists in the fifteenth century, the African people have lived miserably under the dark colonial rule for four to five hundred years, but the great African people have never ceased their heroic struggle against colonial oppression and enslavement. Today, tremendous and inspiring changes are taking place on the African continent. The African people have stood up, and the so-called "Dark Continent" has dawned. To date, the African people, who account for about two-thirds of the African territory and about three-fifths of the total African population, have achieved independence or preliminary independence. They are waging heroic struggles to further rid themselves of imperialist political and economic control and cultural influence, and to withdraw foreign troops and abolish foreign military bases. The tenacious struggles of the African people in various countries that have not yet achieved independence to achieve national independence are forming an irresistible torrent. The mutual unity and support of the African people in their common struggle against colonialism is also constantly strengthening. They are using various forms and means of struggle to deal with imperialism. The African national independence movement has entered a higher stage. We firmly believe that the future of the great African people is infinitely bright. The struggle of the African people is by no means isolated. The 650 million Chinese people stand firmly on the side of the African people, and the people of socialist countries and the people of the world stand firmly on the side of the African people. The African people will surely achieve final victory.
    The vigorous development of the African national independence movement reflects the tremendous changes in the contemporary international situation. The rapid development of the struggles of the people of all countries in the world for peace, democracy, national liberation and socialism has become the mainstream of the world situation. The united front against imperialism formed in their struggles is constantly developing and expanding. The imperialist countries headed by US imperialism have fallen into the heavy encirclement of the people of the world, and their lifespan will not be very long. However, imperialism is by no means reconciled to its own defeat. The closer they get to death, the more frantically they will struggle. Recently, while stepping up arms expansion and war preparations on a world scale and creating tense situations, US imperialism has also been carrying out counterattacks and interference against the national democratic movements and the progressive cause of the people of all countries in Asia, Africa and Latin America. US imperialism is currently painstakingly plotting conspiracies of subversion and interference against the people of Cuba and Laos. In Africa, the old-line imperialists are still exhausting all their conspiracies and tricks in an attempt to maintain or restore their colonial rule; but more noteworthy is that US imperialism is doing everything possible to replace the position of the old-line imperialists. US imperialism not only supports the French imperialists in carrying out the criminal colonial war in Algeria, supports the colonial authorities of the Union of South Africa in pursuing a barbarous policy of racial discrimination, but is also invading the Congo on a large scale under the banner of the United Nations, carrying out interference and creating division in order to realize its conspiracy to swallow the Congo. If the conspiracy of US imperialism can succeed in the Congo today, it will launch its conspiracy against other independent countries in Africa tomorrow. Therefore, the facts clearly show that US imperialism is the most dangerous enemy of the people of Asia, Africa and Latin America, and the common enemy of all peace-loving countries and people in the world. We are deeply convinced that as long as the people of Asia, Africa, Latin America and the world further unite, maintain a high degree of vigilance and constantly expose the various conspiracies of imperialism, and wage a resolute struggle against them, the conspiracies of imperialism will surely be thoroughly defeated.
    The Chinese people have always spared no effort to strengthen the unity of socialist countries, to strengthen the unity of all peace-loving countries and people in the world, and to wage an unyielding struggle against US imperialist aggression and to safeguard world peace. The People's Republic of China has always pursued a peaceful foreign policy, advocated peaceful coexistence among countries with different social systems, and has made unremitting efforts for this purpose. As early as before the Bandung Conference, the Chinese government, together with the Indian government and the Burmese government, jointly advocated the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. The Chinese government has developed friendly and cooperative relations with many Asian and African countries in accordance with the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, and has signed treaties of friendship and non-aggression or treaties of peace and friendship with a series of friendly Asian countries. We advocate peaceful resolution of international disputes without resorting to force. We have consistently supported the Soviet Union's initiatives and actions on disarmament, the prohibition of nuclear weapons, and other initiatives aimed at easing international tensions. Our peaceful foreign policy is increasingly gaining the sympathy and support of the people of all countries in the world.
    Your Excellency President, the friendship between the Chinese people and the Guinean people has a deep foundation. Your Excellency's friendly visit to our country gives us the opportunity to exchange views on further enhancing friendly cooperation between China and Guinea, as well as issues of common concern to the two countries. This not only conforms to the vital interests of the people of China and Guinea, but will also help enhance mutual understanding and friendship between the Chinese people and the people of African countries, and will be conducive to the noble cause of safeguarding world peace.
    Finally, I propose a toast:
    To the friendship between the people of China and Guinea!
    To the victory of the national independence movements in Asia, Africa and Latin America!
    To Asian-African solidarity and world peace!
    To the health of His Excellency President Sékou Touré and all distinguished guests from Guinea!
    Cheers!

    在欢迎塞古·杜尔总统的国宴上
    刘少奇主席的讲话
    新华社10日讯　刘少奇主席在招待杜尔总统国宴上的讲话，全文如下：尊敬的塞古·杜尔总统阁下，尊敬的几内亚政府代表团的全体贵宾们，同志们，朋友们：
    非洲杰出的政治家、几内亚人民的领袖、几内亚共和国总统塞古·杜尔阁下，和几内亚政府代表团的其他贵宾们远道前来我国访问，给我们带来了几内亚人民和非洲人民对中国人民的珍贵友谊，我们非常高兴。我谨代表中国人民表示热烈的欢迎和衷心的感谢。
    杜尔总统是几内亚的民族英雄，他很早就献身于几内亚人民的民族独立事业，领导几内亚人民同法国殖民主义者进行了长期的不屈不挠的斗争，终于赢得了几内亚的独立和自由。在几内亚独立后的短短时期内，杜尔总统又领导着几内亚人民粉碎了帝国主义的多次颠复阴谋，为清除殖民主义残余势力和发展民族经济进行了有成效的斗争，并且在加强亚非人民团结、反对帝国主义和保卫世界和平的事业中做出了积极的贡献。几内亚人民的伟大胜利，大大鼓舞了非洲各国人民反对殖民主义、争取民族独立的斗争，加速了帝国主义殖民体系在非洲的崩溃。中国人民一向把几内亚人民的胜利，看做是自己的胜利，把几内亚人民的成就，看做是自己的成就。我们对英勇的几内亚人民表示极大的钦佩。
    朋友们，同志们，自从十五世纪西方殖民主义者侵入非洲大陆以来，非洲人民在暗无天日的殖民统治下悲惨地生活了四、五百年，但是伟大的非洲人民从来没有停止过反对殖民主义压迫和奴役的英勇斗争。今天，非洲大陆正在发生着振奋人心的巨大变化，非洲人民已经站起来了，所谓“黑暗大陆”已经破晓了。到目前为止，在将近三分之二的非洲土地上，占全非人口约五分之三的非洲人民已经获得独立或者初步独立了。他们正在为进一步摆脱帝国主义的政治经济控制和文化影响以及为撤退外国军队、取消外国军事基地而进行英勇的斗争。尚未取得独立的非洲各国人民为争取实现民族独立而进行的顽强斗争，正在形成为一个不可抗拒的洪流。非洲人民在他们反对殖民主义的共同斗争中的互相团结和支持也在不断地加强，他们用多种多样的斗争方式和手段，来对付帝国主义。非洲的民族独立运动已经进入一个更高的阶段。我们坚信，伟大的非洲人民的前途是无限光明的。非洲人民的斗争决不是孤立的。六亿五千万中国人民是坚决站在非洲人民的一边的，社会主义阵营各国人民和全世界人民是坚决站在非洲人民的一边的。非洲人民一定能够取得最后胜利。
    非洲民族独立运动的蓬勃发展，反映了当代国际形势的巨大变化。世界各国人民争取和平、民主、民族解放和社会主义的斗争的迅猛发展已经成为世界局势的主流。他们在斗争中形成的反对帝国主义的统一战线正在不断发展和扩大。以美帝国主义为首的帝国主义国家已经陷入全世界人民的重重包围之中，它们的寿命不会很长了。但是，帝国主义决不甘心于它们自己的失败，它们越是接近死亡，就越要进行疯狂的挣扎。最近，美帝国主义在世界范围内加紧扩军备战，制造紧张局势的同时，还在对亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲的民族民主运动和各国人民的进步事业进行反扑和干涉。美帝国主义目前正在处心积虑地对古巴和老挝人民策划颠复和干涉的阴谋。在非洲，老牌帝国主义仍在用尽一切阴谋诡计，企图维持或者恢复它们的殖民统治；但更加值得注意的是，美帝国主义正在千方百计地取代老牌帝国主义的地位。美帝国主义不但支持法帝国主义在阿尔及利亚进行罪恶的殖民战争，支持南非联邦殖民当局推行野蛮的种族歧视政策，而且正打着联合国的旗号，大举侵入刚果，进行干涉，制造分裂，以实现其鲸吞刚果的阴谋。如果美帝国主义的阴谋今天能够在刚果得逞，它明天就会向非洲其他独立国家施展其阴谋。因此，事实清楚地说明美帝国主义是亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲人民最危险的敌人，是世界一切爱好和平的国家和人民的共同敌人。我们深信，只要亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲和世界各国人民进一步团结起来，高度地警惕并且不断地揭露帝国主义的各种阴谋，并同它们进行坚决的斗争，帝国主义的阴谋一定要遭受到彻底的失败。
    中国人民始终不遗余力地加强社会主义阵营各国的团结，加强世界一切爱好和平的国家和人民的团结，为反对美帝国主义的侵略、保卫世界和平进行不屈不挠的斗争。中华人民共和国一贯奉行和平的外交政策，主张不同社会制度的国家和平共处，并且坚持不懈地为此进行努力。早在万隆会议以前，中国政府就同印度政府、缅甸政府共同倡导了和平共处五项原则。中国政府根据和平共处五项原则同许多亚非国家发展了友好合作的关系，并同一系列友好的亚洲国家签订了友好和互不侵犯条约或者和平友好条约。我们主张和平解决国际争端，而不诉诸武力。我们一贯支持苏联关于裁军、禁止核武器以及其它旨在缓和国际紧张局势的倡议和行动。我们的和平外交政策正日益得到世界各国人民的同情和支持。
    尊敬的总统阁下，中国人民和几内亚人民的友谊是有着深厚的基础的。总统阁下这次来到我国作友好访问，使我们有机会就进一步增强中几两国的友好合作，以及两国共同关心的问题交换意见。这不仅符合中几两国人民的切身利益，而且将有利于增进中国人民和非洲各国人民的相互了解和友谊，有利于保卫世界和平的崇高事业。
    最后，我提议：
    为中几两国人民的友谊
    为亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲民族独立运动的胜利
    为亚非团结和世界和平
    为塞古·杜尔总统阁下和几内亚全体贵宾的健康
    干杯！
