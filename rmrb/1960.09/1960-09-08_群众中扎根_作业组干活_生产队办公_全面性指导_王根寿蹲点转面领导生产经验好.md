　　Wang Genshou's Experience in Staying at a Point and Extending to the Whole Area is Good for Leading Production

　　(Our dispatch) How can cadres combine work at selected points with overall work, and effectively strengthen leadership over overall work, after going deep into grassroots levels and participating in and leading production? The experience of Comrade Wang Genshou, Deputy Secretary of the Jin Kong District Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in Yanting County, Sichuan Province, in staying at a point and then broadening his leadership in the 7-1 production team of the Jin Kong Commune, answers this question. His work is characterized by: rooting himself among the masses, working in operation groups, office in production teams, and giving guidance to the whole area.

　　In March of this year, Comrade Wang Genshou took up residence in the Fourth Production Team of the 7-1 District Team of the Jin Kong Commune. Comrade Wang Genshou worked in the production team and labored in the operation group, appearing among the masses entirely as an ordinary laborer. When he worked, he did, watched, thought, spoke, and asked, and was an “intentional person” in every respect. He even had a clear idea of what occasions to participate in labor, what kind of work to do, who to work with, and what kind of problems and experiences to focus on studying during labor. This year, at the beginning of rice transplanting, the work efficiency was very low, with an average of one or two fen planted per person per day, and three fen was considered high efficiency. At this rate, it would take more than a month to finish planting the rice in many places. Comrade Wang Genshou consciously went to the Third Production Team to transplant rice with skilled transplanting workers such as Ren Chuangui and Xu Zongyuan. Because novices were mixed in the middle, there was mutual restraint, and more than twenty people only transplanted more than four mu in the morning. From his actual observations, Comrade Wang Genshou found that the novices were slow in transplanting, and that in addition to the low speed of dividing seedlings, they also did not space the seedlings evenly, wasting a lot of time drawing lines and comparing. Comrade Wang Genshou immediately proposed the suggestion of “marking the seedlings in grids (i.e., first transplanting a row of seedlings every five rows horizontally and vertically to get started) and competing by grids,” and organized everyone to experiment. After fifty minutes, the skilled workers had transplanted one fen each, and the novices had also transplanted nine li, with some novices even keeping pace with the skilled workers. Therefore, he promoted this experience throughout the district through a telephone conference, and the district committee issued the call for “one person one mu of seedlings per day.” That afternoon, Comrade Wang Genshou and District Committee Secretary Yang Jieming also demonstrated in the Third District Team of the Jin Kong Commune and the Seventh District Team of the Zhegong Commune, so that the masses quickly mastered this experience. As a result, the progress of rice transplanting in the entire district was greatly accelerated, and the 7-1 District Team basically completed the rice transplanting task in only seven days. Recently, the work of increasing the planting of late autumn crops, accumulating fertilizer, and field management have been crowded together, and it is necessary to seize the season, and the labor force appears to be tight. After discussing with the cadres and the masses, Comrade Wang Genshou proposed the method of “general mobilization in the morning, separate work in the afternoon.” That is, from 5 to 10 a.m. every day, all people except a few who cook meals participate in the front line of work, and only after 10 a.m. do they engage in their own professions. In this way, it not only conforms to the current seasonal characteristics, making full use of every minute and second of labor time, but also makes the labor force on the front line more abundant. After this method was promoted throughout the district, all tasks were carried out vigorously.

　　Comrade Wang Genshou has been down-to-earth for more than five months, participating in production and leading production, and has already explored some experiences. To sum up, there are the following points:

　　1. Stay at a good point, participate in production on the spot, lead production, dissect a sparrow well, and guide the whole area;

　　2. Turn to the whole area in a planned way, focus on checking and solving problems, and grasp the overall situation;

　　3. Make friends with the masses, first of all with poor and lower-middle peasants, and often listen to their opinions on production and work, and understand their demands and difficulties;

　　4. Work in a planned and purposeful manner, so that you are both an ordinary laborer and pay attention to discovering key problems, and strengthen the leadership of production and work;

　　5. Take the initiative to offer ideas and make arrangements to help grassroots cadres work, so that they can continuously improve their ideological level and leadership level;

　　6. At all times, have a keen sense of new things, summarize experiences when they are discovered, and continue to improve them in practice, so that they rise to theoretical things;

　　7. Promote the experiences of the points through command fields, field meetings, on-site meetings, and turning to the whole area, so as to achieve the combination of points and areas, and use points to lead the areas.

　　Comrade Wang Genshou told others about his experience, saying that by following the above methods, you can overcome both "flying all over the sky" and "working with your head down." However, if you want to do well, the most important thing is to conscientiously adhere to the "four togethers."

    群众中扎根　作业组干活　生产队办公　全面性指导
    王根寿蹲点转面领导生产经验好
    本报讯　干部在深入基层、参加生产领导生产后，怎样才能作到点面结合，切实加强对全面工作的领导？中共四川盐亭县金孔区委副书记王根寿同志在金孔公社七一区队蹲点转面的经验，回答了这个问题。他的工作特点是：群众中扎根，作业组干活，生产队办公，面上作指导。
    今年3月，王根寿同志到金孔公社七一区队的四生产队住了下来。王根寿同志办公在生产队，劳动在作业组，完全以一个普通劳动者的姿态在群众中出现。他在劳动的时候，有干、有看、有想、有说、有问，处处作“有心人”，甚至到什么场合去参加劳动，干什么样的活路，同那些人一道干，劳动中着重研究什么样的问题和经验，他都心中有数。今年栽秧，刚开始时工效很低，平均每人每天栽一分、两分，三分就是高工效。按照这个进度，很多地方要一个多月才把秧子栽得完。王根寿同志就有意识地到三生产队去同栽秧能手任传贵、胥宗元等一道栽秧。由于有生手夹在中间，互相牵制，二十多个人一上午才栽了四亩多。王根寿同志从实际观察中发现，新手栽得慢，除了分秧速度不高外，点子也打不匀，东比西划浪费了很多时间。王根寿同志当场提出了“秧苗划格（即每隔五行横竖先栽一路秧子，起个头），分格竞赛”的建议，组织大家试验。五十分钟过去了，熟手每人栽到一分，生手也栽到九厘，有的生手还跟熟手拉平了。于是，他通过电话会议在全区范围内推广了这一经验，并由区委发出“一人一天一亩秧”的号召。当天下午，王根寿同志还和区委杨杰明书记一道，在金孔公社三区队、折弓公社七区队等地示范，使这项经验很快为群众所掌握。结果，全区栽秧进度大大加快，七一区队仅七天就基本上完成了栽秧任务。最近这段时间，增种晚秋、积造肥料、田间管理等工作挤在一起，都要抢季节，劳动力显得紧张。王根寿同志和干部、群众商量后，提出了“上午总动员、下午分开干”的出工方法。即每天上午五至十点除少数煮饭的人以外，全部参加第一线干活，十点钟后才各搞自己的本行。这样，既合乎当前季节特点，充分利用一分一秒的劳动时间，又使第一线的劳力更为雄厚。这个方法在全区推广后，各项工作搞得有声有色。
    王根寿同志五个多月来脚踏实地，参加生产领导生产，已经摸索出一些经验，归纳起来，有以下几点：
    一、蹲好一个点，实地参加生产，领导生产，解剖好一只麻雀，指导全面；
    二、有计划地转面，重点地检查和解决问题，掌握全面情况；
    三、和群众交朋友，首先是和贫农、下中农交朋友，经常听取他们对生产、工作的意见，了解他们的要求和困难；
    四、有计划、有目的地干活，做到既是一个普通劳动者，又注意发现关键性的问题，加强对生产、工作的领导；
    五、主动出主意、作安排，帮助基层干部工作，使他们不断提高思想水平和领导水平；
    六、时时刻刻对新鲜事物有灵敏的感觉，发现经验就加以总结，并在实践中继续提高，使它上升为理论性的东西；
    七、通过指挥田、田间会师、现场会、转面等办法，推广点上的经验，作到点面结合、以点带面。
    王根寿同志向别人介绍自己的体会说，按照上述办法作，既可以克服“满天飞”，又可以克服“闷头干”。但是要想作得好，最重要的一条是必须认真坚持“四同”。
