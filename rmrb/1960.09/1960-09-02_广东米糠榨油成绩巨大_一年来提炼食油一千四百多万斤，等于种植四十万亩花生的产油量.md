This newspaper reports from Guangzhou on September 1st: Guangdong Province has achieved great success in the widespread promotion of rice bran oil extraction. According to statistics, state-owned grain processing departments across the province have produced more than 17.7 million jin of rice bran oil and extracted over 14 million jin of edible oil from the second half of last year to the first half of this year. This figure is equivalent to the oil yield of approximately 400,000 mu of peanuts, accounting for a significant proportion of the province's edible oil supply. If the oil extraction volume of people's communes, production brigades, and public canteens in various places is also included, the quantity would be even greater.

Guangdong is a province that lacks oil. For many years, a large portion of the edible oil needed by the people has relied on supplies from all over the country. In order to strive for self-sufficiency in edible oil as soon as possible, the Guangdong Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party proposed the idea of using rice bran for oil extraction as early as June last year. Based on the experience of individual regions in using rice bran for oil extraction and the calculations of relevant departments, as long as the rice bran from the rural people's rations is utilized throughout the province, edible oil production can be increased by more than 40 million jin. At the same time, with the continuous increase in rice production, this quantity will continue to grow. After analyzing the above situation, the Guangdong Provincial Committee decided to vigorously promote rice bran oil extraction throughout the province while continuing to focus on the production of oil crops.

Since the Guangdong Provincial Committee issued instructions on carrying out rice bran oil extraction, all 595 state-owned grain processing factories in various counties and cities throughout the province have successively promoted rice bran oil extraction. With the help and leadership of the grain departments, many communes and production brigades have also successively promoted rice bran oil extraction. Wherever rice bran oil extraction is actively promoted, immediate results are achieved, and the people's edible oil levels are significantly improved. For example, Dongguan County in the Foshan area used to import more than 900,000 jin of edible oil from other places every year. After carrying out rice bran oil extraction, it quickly achieved self-sufficiency in edible oil. In the first half of this year, the county's rice bran oil production had reached more than 500,000 jin, while only 40% of the rice bran among the people has been utilized, indicating that there is still considerable potential. Lile Commune in Xinhui County used to be an oil-deficient commune. After using rice bran for oil extraction in February this year, it produced more than 16,000 jin of rice bran oil and refined 13,800 jin of edible oil in just over two months, ensuring the people's oil consumption.

After Guangdong's various regions carried out rice bran oil extraction, not only did it improve the edible oil supply situation, but it also used the rice bran cake left after oil extraction to produce a large number of maltose, white wine, soy sauce, vinegar and other non-staple foods, as well as a variety of products such as rice bran wax, organic calcium acid, casein, vitamin B, amylase, and soap. The oil residue after refining edible oil can also be used to replace tung oil and as industrial oil, achieving multiple uses for one item and making the most of everything. In the first half of this year, Dabu County used rice bran cake left after oil extraction to produce 710,000 jin of maltose and 40-proof white wine alone. The average per capita distribution in the county was 0.92 jin of maltose and 0.85 jin of white wine. In addition, the distiller's grains left over after brewing wine with rice bran cake in various places are also excellent feed for raising pigs. Dongguan County used distiller's grains and other concentrated feed to feed pigs, increasing the number of live pigs in stock at the end of June this year from more than 146,000 at the end of last year to more than 198,000, an increase of 35.61%.

After rice bran oil extraction and comprehensive utilization, the economic value of rice bran has increased by an average of five times, also increasing income for the state, communes, and production brigades. Based on the comprehensive utilization of rice bran in Guangdong Province in the first half of this year, it has increased the nation's wealth by 14 million yuan. In order to further spread rice bran oil extraction throughout the province, the Guangdong Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party recently issued another instruction, requiring local party committees to conduct a comprehensive inspection of this work. Regions that have not yet carried out rice bran oil extraction must start doing so within a specified time limit in order to expand the source of edible oil production, increase national wealth, and promote production development.

    广东米糠榨油成绩巨大
    一年来提炼食油一千四百多万斤，等于种植四十万亩花生的产油量
    本报广州1日电　广东省普遍推广米糠榨油取得巨大成绩。据统计，全省国营粮食加工部门由去年下半年起到今年上半年止，已生产糠油一千七百七十多万斤，提炼食油一千四百多万斤。这个数字，等于种植四十万亩左右的花生产油量。在全省食用油当中占了不小的比例。如果要把各地人民公社、生产大队和公共食堂的榨油量也计算在内，数量就更多。
      广东是个缺油省。历年以来，人民群众所需要的食油，很大一部分要靠全国各地供应。为了力争食油早日自给，中共广东省委早在去年6月，就提出了利用米糠榨油的主张。根据个别地区利用米糠榨油的经验和有关部门的计算，全省只要把农村群众口粮中的米糠利用起来，就可以增产食油四千万斤以上。同时，随着稻谷产量的不断增加，这一数量也将不断增大。广东省委分析了上述情况以后，决定在继续抓好油料作物生产的同时，在全省大力推行米糠榨油。
    自从广东省委发出关于开展米糠榨油的指示以来，全省各个县、市的五百九十五个国营粮食加工厂，都已先后推行了米糠榨油。在粮食部门的帮助和带动下，许多公社和生产大队，也都先后推广了米糠榨油。凡是积极推行米糠榨油的地区，无不收到立竿见影的效果，群众食油水平显著提高。像佛山专区的东莞县，过去每年要由外地调入食油九十多万斤。开展米糠榨油以后，很快做到了食油自给，今年上半年，这个县的糠油产量已经达到五十多万斤，而人民群众当中的米糠，仅仅利用了40％，潜力依然不小。新会县礼乐公社，过去是一个缺油公社，今年2月利用米糠榨油以后，两个多月就产糠油一万六千多斤，提炼食油一万三千八百斤，保证了人民群众的吃油。
    广东各地开展米糠榨油以后，不仅改善了食油供应情况，而且还利用榨油后的糠饼制做了大量的饴糖、白酒、酱醋等副食品和一部分糠腊、有机酸钙、干酪素、维生素乙、戊和肥皂等多种产品。提炼食油后的油脚还可用来代替木油和作工业用油。做到一物多用，物尽其用。大埔县今年上半年利用榨油后的糠饼，仅生产饴糖和四十度白酒两项就达七十一万斤，全县平均每人可分得饴糖零点九二斤和白酒零点八五斤。此外，各地利用糠饼酿酒后，剩下的酒糟，又是养猪的大好饲料。东莞县利用酒糟和其他精饲料喂猪，使今年6月底的生猪存栏数量，由去年底的十四万六千多头，增加到十九万八千多头，即增长了35.61％。
    米糠榨油和综合利用以后，米糠的经济价值平均提高了五倍。也给国家、公社和生产大队增加了收入。以广东全省今年上半年综合利用的米糠计算，就为国家增加了一千四百万元的财富。为了进一步把米糠榨油遍及全省，中共广东省委最近再次发出指示，要求各地党委对这一工作进行一次全面检查。还没有开展米糠榨油的地区，要限期开展起来，以便扩大食油生产来源，增加国家财富，促进生产发展。
