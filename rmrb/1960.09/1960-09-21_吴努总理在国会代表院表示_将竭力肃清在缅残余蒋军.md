Xinhua News Agency, Rangoon, September 19th: Burmese Prime Minister U Nu stated today in the Chamber of Deputies that the Burmese armed forces will exert all efforts to eradicate the remaining Chiang Kai-shek bandit troops in Burma.

Prime Minister U Nu made these remarks in response to a request from a member of parliament. The parliamentarian proposed that the Burmese government should do everything possible to eradicate the remaining Chiang Kai-shek bandit troops in Burma, otherwise, they would pose a threat to Burma.

Prime Minister U Nu said in the Chamber of Deputies that the remaining Chiang Kai-shek bandit troops originally intended to seize and occupy Moulmein, using this port to obtain supplies and ammunition from abroad in order to attack China. Due to the efforts of the Burmese armed forces, their conspiracy was thwarted, and their strength has been greatly weakened.

Prime Minister U Nu also said that the remaining Chiang Kai-shek bandit troops are currently engaged in illegal arms trading and opium smuggling.

　  吴努总理在国会代表院表示
　　将竭力肃清在缅残余蒋军
    新华社仰光19日电　缅甸总理吴努今天在国会代表院说，缅甸武装部队将竭力肃清在缅甸的蒋帮残余部队。
    吴努总理是在答复一位议员的要求时说这番话的。这位议员提出，缅甸政府应该竭尽全力肃清在缅甸的蒋帮残余部队，否则它们将形成对缅甸的威胁。
    吴努总理在代表院说，蒋帮残余部队原来打算夺取和占领毛淡棉，通过这个港口来从外国得到供应和弹药，以便攻击中国。由于缅甸武装部队作出了努力，它们的阴谋被挫败了，它们的力量也已大大削弱。
    吴努总理还说，蒋帮残余部队目前正在从事非法的军火买卖和鸦片走私。
