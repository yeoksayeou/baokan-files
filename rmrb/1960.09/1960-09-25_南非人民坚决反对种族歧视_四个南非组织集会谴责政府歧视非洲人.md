Xinhua News Agency, London, September 23rd: Representatives of four organizations, including the African National Congress of South Africa, the South African Indian Congress, the South West African National Union, and the Pan-Africanist Congress, jointly held an anti-apartheid conference here tonight. The main slogan of the conference was: "Freedom, not Slavery."

　　Yusuf Dadoo, representing the South African Indian Congress, spoke at the meeting. He condemned the South African government's policy of forcibly implementing "white supremacy" against Africans and other people of color. He said that the recent cancellation of the "Emergency Act" by the South African federal government had created illusions among some people. However, in fact, the South African government is busy recruiting and training troops among whites to intensify the suppression of non-whites. Dadoo called on people to support the movement to boycott South African goods.

　　He said, "The oppressed people of South Africa will obtain freedom by peaceful means or by violence and bloodshed."

　　Mahomo, a representative of the Pan-Africanist Congress, spoke about the cruel racial discrimination imposed on the heads of South African Africans by the South African government. He revealed that just a week ago, another twelve African nationalists were arrested in South Africa. He said that unless Africans are given their due rights, the situation in South Africa will not return to "normal."

　　Oliver Tambo, Vice President of the African National Congress of South Africa, and Kozonguizi, Chairman of the South West African National Union, also spoke at the rally.

　　After the rally, a "donation campaign" was launched to collect signatures and raise funds to support the South African people's struggle against racial discrimination.

　　南非人民坚决反对种族歧视
　  四个南非组织集会谴责政府歧视非洲人
    新华社伦敦23日电　南非非洲人国民大会、南非印度人大会、西南非洲民族联盟和泛非主义者大会等四个组织的代表，今晚在这里联合举行反对种族隔离大会。大会的主要口号是：“要自由，不要奴役”。
    优素福·达杜代表南非印度人大会在会上发言。他谴责南非政府对非洲人和其他有色人强行实施“白人优越”的政策。他说，南非联邦政府最近取消“紧急法案”这件事在有些人中间造成了幻想。但是，事实上，南非政府正忙于在白人当中招募和训练军队，来加紧对非白人的镇压。达杜号召人们支持抵制南非货物的运动。
    他说，“南非被压迫人民将用和平的方法或者暴力和流血冲突的方法来获得自由。”
    泛非主义者大会代表马霍莫谈到了南非政府强加在南非非洲人头上的残酷的种族歧视。他透露，仅仅在一星期以前，就又有十二名非洲民族主义者在南非被捕。他说，除非非洲人得到了他们应有的权利，否则南非的局势是不会恢复“正常的”。
    在集会上讲话的还有南非非洲人国民大会副主席奥利弗·坦博和西南非洲民族联盟主席科章吉济。
    在集会结束以后，发起了一个“捐款运动”，以便征集签名和募款来支援南非人民反对种族歧视的斗争。
