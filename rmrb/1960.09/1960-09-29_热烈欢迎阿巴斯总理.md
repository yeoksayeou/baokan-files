　　On the eve of the eleventh anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, the delegation of the Provisional Government of the Republic of Algeria, headed by Prime Minister Ferhat Abbas, is visiting our country at the invitation of our Premier Zhou Enlai. The Chinese people warmly welcome the envoys of friendship from the heroic country, and extend our cordial greetings and high respect to the distinguished Algerian guests who have traveled thousands of miles to visit China!
    The Chinese people have always expressed deep sympathy and great admiration for the Algerian people's spirit of perseverance in struggle. For six years, the Algerian people have held high the banner of national liberation and waged a tenacious struggle against the French colonialists, supported by U.S. imperialism, under extremely difficult conditions. Despite the frenzied suppression and massacres of the Algerian people by the French colonial army equipped with modern equipment, the heroic Algerian people have become stronger and stronger in battle, constantly achieving great victories. According to war reports released by the Algerian National Liberation Army, from the beginning of this year to the end of August, more than 30,000 French colonial troops were annihilated on the Algerian battlefield. Together with the number of French troops annihilated in the past five years, the total amounts to about 150,000. The heroic struggle of the Algerian people has not only set a shining example for the African people and all oppressed people, greatly inspiring the struggle of the people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America against imperialism and colonialism and for national independence, but also powerfully struck at the forces of war and aggression of imperialism headed by the United States, making a significant contribution to the maintenance of world peace.
    Under the heavy blows of the Algerian people, the defeat of the French colonialists is a foregone conclusion. But colonialists are never reconciled to their failure. While stepping up armed suppression, they are constantly plotting new political conspiracies. French President de Gaulle has repeatedly put forward the principle of granting the Algerian people the "right to self-determination" and has adopted a posture of preparing to "negotiate" with the Algerian people. However, when the envoys of the Algerian Provisional Government requested in Melun to negotiate with the French government on "the conditions and guarantees of self-determination," the French government blatantly refused. This once again proves that the French colonialists originally attempted to obtain from the negotiating table the "victory" they could not win on the battlefield. The Algerian people understand that whether it is armed struggle or peaceful negotiation, it is all for the sake of winning Algeria's true freedom and independence. As Prime Minister Abbas said: "While seeking negotiations and giving peace every opportunity, we must strengthen our means of combat and armed struggle. Independence is not readily available; it must be won." In order to win national independence, the Algerian people, while continuing to wage a war of liberation against the armed aggression of the French colonialists, do not refuse to conduct peaceful negotiations, but also do not hold unrealistic illusions about negotiations.
    The Algerian people not only face the enemy of the French colonialists, but also face a more insidious and ferocious neo-colonialist—U.S. imperialism. The United States has long coveted Algeria's rich oil resources. It not only helps the French colonialists massacre the Algerian people through various forms of "aid," but also tries to infiltrate its own forces into Algeria through its support for France, so as to replace France. Recently, U.S. imperialism has even blatantly carried out barbarous intervention and aggression against the Congo under the banner of the United Nations, attempting to achieve the conspiracy of swallowing up the Congo through the United Nations. The United States also intends to use the vicious methods it used in the Congo to invade the entire African continent. However, neither old colonialism nor neo-colonialism can stop the development of the national liberation movement of the African people. All people who dare to rise up to fight for independence and freedom, and who dare to wage a resolute struggle against imperialism and colonialism, are invincible. The heroic Algerian people and the African people will surely achieve a complete victory.
    The struggle of the Algerian people is not isolated. It has received widespread sympathy and support from the African people, the Asian people, and the people of the world. The Chinese people have always firmly supported the just struggle of the Algerian people, and at the same time regard the Algerian people's struggle for national liberation as a major support for our country's struggle against imperialism. Because China and Algeria have a common historical experience, our two countries care for and support each other in the struggle against imperialism. The Algerian people can fully expect that they will continue to receive the full support of the Chinese people in the future struggle against imperialism and colonialism. The Chinese people will always stand on the side of the Algerian people.
    Although China and Algeria are far apart, the common struggle against imperialism has closely linked the people of our two countries together. In recent years, with the establishment of the Algerian Provisional Government, friendly exchanges between our two countries have become increasingly frequent, and the friendship between our two peoples has greatly developed. The Chinese people have had the honor of receiving delegations and military delegations from the Algerian Provisional Government. We firmly believe that this visit to our country by the delegation of the Algerian Provisional Government headed by Prime Minister Ferhat Abbas will greatly strengthen the friendly and cooperative relations between China and Algeria, and further consolidate the unbreakable friendship forged between the Chinese people and the Algerian people and the African people in the common struggle against imperialism and colonialism.

### 热烈欢迎阿巴斯总理

　　热烈欢迎阿巴斯总理
    在中华人民共和国成立十一周年的前夕，以阿尔及利亚共和国临时政府总理阿巴斯·费尔哈特为首的阿尔及利亚临时政府代表团，应我国周恩来总理邀请前来我国访问。中国人民热烈欢迎来自英雄国家的友谊使者，并且向不辞辛劳万里来访中国的阿尔及利亚贵宾致以亲切的问候和崇高的敬意！
    中国人民一向对阿尔及利亚人民坚持斗争的精神表示深切的同情和极大的钦佩。六年来，阿尔及利亚人民高举着民族解放的旗帜，在极端艰苦的条件下，同美帝国主义支持的法国殖民者进行了百折不挠的斗争。尽管配备着现代化装备的法国殖民军队对阿尔及利亚人民进行了疯狂的镇压和屠杀，但是英勇的阿尔及利亚人民越战越强，不断取得巨大的胜利。根据阿尔及利亚民族解放军公布的战报，从今年年初到8月底，法国殖民军在阿尔及利亚战场上被歼灭达三万多人，连同过去五年法军被歼灭的人数，总计达十五万人左右。阿尔及利亚人民的英勇斗争不仅为非洲人民和一切被压迫人民树立了光辉的榜样，大大鼓舞了亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲各国人民反对帝国主义和殖民主义、争取和维护民族独立的斗争，而且有力地打击了以美国为首的帝国主义的战争和侵略势力，为维护世界和平作出了重大的贡献。
    在阿尔及利亚人民沉重的铁拳的打击下，法国殖民者的败局已定。但是殖民主义者从来不甘心自己的失败，他们在加紧武装镇压的同时，又不断策划新的政治阴谋。法国总统戴高乐反复提出了给予阿尔及利亚人民“自决权”的原则，并且摆出了准备同阿尔及利亚人民“谈判”的姿态。但是，当阿尔及利亚临时政府的使者在默伦要求同法国政府就“自决的条件和保证”进行谈判时，法国政府又悍然加以拒绝。这就再一次证明，法国殖民者原来是企图从谈判桌上获得他们从战场上所不能赢得的“胜利”，阿尔及利亚人民懂得，不论是武装斗争也好，和平谈判也好，都是为了争取阿尔及利亚的真正的自由和独立。正如阿巴斯总理所说的：“在寻求谈判和给予和平一切机会的同时，我们必须加强我们的战斗手段和武装斗争。独立不是垂手可得的，它必须是赢得的。”阿尔及利亚人民为了争取民族独立，在继续进行解放战争以反对法国殖民者的武装侵略的同时，不拒绝进行和平谈判，同时又不对谈判抱不切实际的幻想。
    阿尔及利亚人民不仅面对着法国殖民者这一个敌人，而且还面临着一个更加阴险、凶恶的新殖民主义者——美帝国主义。美国对于阿尔及利亚富饶的石油，早已垂涎三尺。它不仅通过种种“援助”帮助法国殖民者屠杀阿尔及利亚人民，而且力图通过对法国的支持，把自己的势力渗入阿尔及利亚，以便取法国的地位而代之。最近，美帝国主义更公然打着联合国的旗号对刚果进行蛮横的干涉和侵略，力图通过联合国实现鲸吞刚果的阴谋。美国还打算把它在刚果使用的恶毒手法，用之于对整个非洲的侵略。但是，不论老殖民主义还是新殖民主义，都没有办法阻挡非洲人民的民族解放运动的发展。一切敢于起来争取独立自由，敢于起来同帝国主义、殖民主义进行坚决斗争的人民，都是不可战胜的。英勇的阿尔及利亚人民和非洲人民一定会得到彻底胜利。
    阿尔及利亚人民的斗争不是孤立的，它得到非洲人民、亚洲人民和全世界人民的广泛同情和支持。中国人民一贯坚决支持阿尔及利亚人民的正义斗争，同时也把阿尔及利亚人民争取民族解放的斗争看作是对我国反对帝国主义斗争的重大支持。由于中阿两国有着共同的历史遭遇，所以我们两国在反对帝国主义的斗争中是互相关怀、互相支持的。阿尔及利亚人民完全可以指望，在今后反对帝国主义和殖民主义的斗争中，将会继续得到中国人民的全力支持。中国人民是永远站在阿尔及利亚人民这一边的。
    中国和阿尔及利亚虽然相距遥远，但是反对帝国主义的共同斗争把我们两国人民牢牢地联系在一起。近几年来，随着阿尔及利亚临时政府的成立，我们两国之间的友好往来日益频繁，我们两国人民之间的友谊有了很大的发展。中国人民曾经荣幸地接待过阿尔及利亚临时政府代表团和军事代表团。我们深信，以阿巴斯·费尔哈特总理为首的阿尔及利亚临时政府代表团这次访问我国，必将大大加强中阿两国的友好合作关系，并且进一步巩固中国人民和阿尔及利亚人民以及非洲人民在反对帝国主义和殖民主义的共同斗争中结成的牢不可破的友谊。
