Eliminate Autumn Crop Diseases and Pests

The autumn-harvested grain crops and industrial raw material crops are currently at a crucial juncture in determining their yield. The primary task on the agricultural front right now is to persistently and unremittingly strengthen the late-stage field management of autumn crops. Field management must be strengthened in two ways simultaneously: on the one hand, to promote early ripening and increased yields; on the other hand, to protect crops from damage. This two-pronged struggle must continue until the crops are harvested and stored. Under normal circumstances, the emphasis should be on the first aspect, but at the same time, sufficient prediction and prevention measures must be taken for the second aspect; in the case of widespread disease and insect outbreaks, the main effort should be concentrated on fighting disease and pest damage first. Only on the basis of ensuring the harvest can we further strive for increased production. Even in times of promising harvests, we must prevent or resist the invasion of disasters in order to secure the fruits of our labor that we have diligently cultivated for more than half a year. In the "Eight-Point Charter" for agriculture, the word "protect" deserves special attention at this time.

The harm caused by diseases and pests to crops, unlike other natural disasters, is generally more concealed, except in particularly severe cases. Many diseases and pests often invade the inside of crops, damaging their tissues, or sucking the sap of crops, much like the damage of chronic diseases to the human body, and it is not easy to attract people's attention. Severe floods and typhoons cause shocking disasters, and naturally everyone concentrates their efforts to deal with them. The harm caused by diseases and pests is less obvious, and people often do not pay as much attention to it as they do to floods and typhoons. In fact, the losses caused by diseases and pests are quite serious. According to estimates by relevant departments in early 1956, in previous years, due to the damage of diseases and pests to crops in our country, grain yields were reduced by 10%, cotton yields by 20%, and fruit yields by about 40%. In recent years, especially since the Great Leap Forward in 1958, great progress has been made in the prevention and control of diseases and pests. However, large amounts of grain and industrial raw materials are still lost to diseases and pests every year. According to recent estimates in Hubei Province, due to disease and pest damage, the province loses at least 5% of its rice production each year, a loss of about 800 million catties of rice, and cotton production is reduced by more than 10%, a loss of about 450,000 dan of ginned cotton. In the Jin southeast District of Shanxi Province, corn borers cause an estimated loss of 100 million catties of grain each year. Diseases and pests are major enemies of agricultural production, and any thought that neglects the prevention and control of diseases and pests is very harmful. On the other hand, we should also be confident that we can overcome diseases and pest disasters. As long as we mobilize the broad masses, carefully study and master the laws of occurrence of diseases and pests, and do a thorough job of prevention, we can take the initiative and wipe out diseases and pests before they cause harm. More than a decade ago, in the revolutionary base areas, we had the experience of launching mass movements to eliminate serious insect plagues. In recent years, the experience in fighting diseases and pests has become richer, and the material conditions have become better and better. It is also very harmful to relax prevention and control work if one sees that diseases and pests are relatively serious in some areas.

The current season is the time of year when diseases and pests occur most frequently, reproduce fastest, and cause the greatest harm. According to incomplete statistics from the four provinces of Hebei, Shandong, Jiangsu, and Hunan, diseases and pests have occurred on more than 97.7 million mu of farmland. Many diseases and pests are much more serious than last year due to suitable climate. The area affected by armyworms in Liaoning Province is three times larger than in 1955, the year with the most severe armyworm outbreak in the province's history. The third generation of rice stem borers in the Yangtze River Basin is coming on strong. Corn borers, cotton bollworms, cutworms, soybean webworms, rice blast, and vegetable diseases are all showing a serious trend of development. In some counties where insect pests are relatively serious, tens of thousands of commune members, under the leadership and assistance of cadres at all levels deeply involved on the front lines, have divided the area into sections, launching fierce and skillful attacks, and have carried out timely and resolute struggles against insect pests, achieving great results. At present, diseases and pests are still continuing to occur in many areas, and everyone must continue to fight hard, prevent and control repeatedly, and never give up until the final victory.

The most favorable time to fight diseases and pests is at the early stage of their occurrence. The earlier the prevention and control measures are taken, the more manpower and materials are saved, and the results are multiplied with half the effort. Recently, the most widespread and serious pests are the various borer insects that attack grain and cotton crops. These pests hatch from egg masses and quickly bore into the inside of crops to cause harm. According to past experience, to effectively prevent and control these pests, special attention must be paid to quickly identifying the insect situation, grasping the key points, seizing the time, and using skill to win. The effect of treating early and late with the same labor and pesticides is very different. According to a survey of eleven people's communes in Henan, Hebei, and Shandong provinces that have achieved remarkable results in controlling cotton bollworms, these communes started the work of preventing and controlling diseases and pests early, on a large scale, and with high quality. Most of the cotton fields basically did not experience leaf rolling, red leaves, or broken leaves. The shedding of buds and bolls due to insect pests generally accounted for 2%-7%, a decrease of more than half compared with the same period last year. The main experience of these eleven communes in eliminating cotton bollworms and reducing the shedding of buds and bolls lies in constantly monitoring the insect situation, promptly catching moths and eggs in large numbers, and applying pesticides in time during the peak egg-laying period of the pests to eliminate the larvae before they bore into the cotton bolls. A major characteristic of current disease and pest occurrences is the wide range of occurrence. It is necessary to grasp the main target according to the changes in the insect situation and use manpower and pesticides where they are most needed. The occurrence of diseases and pests should be ranked, and the diseases and pests that are most numerous and cause the most harm should be eliminated first; the fields should also be ranked, with high-yield fields taking precedence over general fields, and fields with heavy diseases and pests taking precedence over fields with light diseases and pests. In order to maximize the effectiveness of limited pesticides, it is necessary to use pesticides reasonably, save pesticides, and attach equal importance to both locally produced and imported pesticides. In order to ensure the universal and thorough elimination of diseases and pests, it is necessary to implement a responsibility system for the prevention and control of diseases and pests, from checking for insects to controlling insects, taking responsibility to the end, implementing it consistently, and ensuring quality and quantity.

In the work of preventing and controlling diseases and pests, leading cadres at all levels must go deep into the fields, participate in the battle, and command the battle; they must use the disease and pest prevention and control work of high-yield fields as an example to promote the disease and pest prevention and control work of general fields. Among all kinds of crops, we must first and foremost vigorously grasp the prevention and control of grain diseases and pests; of course, the prevention and control of cotton, oil crops, vegetables, and other cash crop diseases and pests cannot be relaxed either. For every piece of crop outside the high-yield fields, including those planted on scattered land and newly reclaimed wasteland, we must ensure the harvest. Since we have planted more, we must manage it well and protect it well in order to achieve the goal of higher yields. Moreover, if we do not pay attention to comprehensive prevention and control, if diseases and pests flourish in any field, they will spread and still cause damage to the crops in the fields that have already been prevented and controlled. Therefore, our slogan is: wherever diseases and pests occur, eliminate them there. This is a concrete manifestation of the principle of simultaneously promoting both increased planting and increased yields and high yields and increased yields in plant protection work, and a manifestation of the principle of taking grain as the key link and developing diversified management.

At present, the situation on the agricultural production front is very good, and the whole Party and the whole people have launched a high tide of running agriculture in a big way and running grain in a big way. Looking at the work of preventing and controlling diseases and pests, the conditions are also more favorable: this year, there are more fully prepared medicines and machinery than in previous years; all localities have rich experience in preventing and controlling diseases and pests of autumn crops; many people's communes have established professional pest control teams, disease and pest forecasting stations, and disease and pest information officers. As long as leading departments at all levels truly put the work of preventing and controlling diseases and pests on the agenda, strengthen leadership, fully mobilize the masses, and take action early, they can thoroughly eliminate diseases and pests and win an autumn harvest.

### 消灭秋季农作物病虫害

    消灭秋季农作物病虫害
    秋收的粮食作物和工业原料作物，目前正处于决定收成的紧要关头。农业战线上当前的首要任务，就是持续不懈地加强秋收作物的后期田间管理。田间管理要从两方面同时加强：一方面是力促作物早熟多收；一方面是力保作物不受损害。这两方面的斗争，都要一直进行到作物登场入仓。在一般情况下，要把工作重点放在第一个方面，但同时对于第二个方面也必须有足够的预测和预防措施；在病虫盛发的情况下，更要首先集中主要力量同病虫灾害作斗争。只有在保收的基础上，才可能进一步力求增产。在丰收有望的时节，也必须防止或抗住灾害的侵袭，才能把大半年辛勤经营的劳动果实稳拿到手。在农业“八字宪法”中，“保”字在目前时期特别值得注意。
    病虫对农作物的危害，和其他自然灾害不同，除去特殊严重的情况外，一般是比较隐蔽的。有许多病虫常常是侵入农作物的内部，破坏农作物的组织，或是吸食农作物的养液，好比慢性病对人体的损害一样，不易引起人们的重视。严重的水灾和台风造成的灾害，使人触目惊心，自然而然地会集中全力加以对付。病虫的危害比较地不那么明显，人们常常不像对待水灾、台风那样注意。其实，病虫造成的损失是相当严重的。据有关部门1956年初的估计，前几年我国农作物因为病虫的侵害，粮食要少收10％，棉花要少收20％，果品要少收40％左右。近几年来，特别是1958年大跃进以来，防治病虫的工作有了很大进展。但每年仍有大量粮食和工业原料被病虫夺去。据湖北省最近估计，全省每年因病虫侵害，水稻至少要少收5％，损失稻谷约八亿斤左右，棉花少收10％以上，损失皮棉约四十五万担。山西省晋东南专区因玉米螟虫为害，每年损失粮食估计有一亿斤。病虫害是农业生产的大敌，任何忽视病虫害防治工作的思想，都是很有害的。另一方面，也应该确信，我们一定能战胜病虫灾害。只要把广大群众动员起来，只要细心地研究和掌握病虫害的发生规律，作好周密的预防工作，我们就能争得主动，把病虫害歼灭在它们为害之前。十几年前，在革命的根据地，我们就有了大搞群众运动扑灭严重虫灾的经验。近几年来，对病虫害作斗争的经验更加丰富，物质条件也越来越好。如果看到某些地区病虫害比较严重就放松防治工作，也是很有害的。
    目前是病虫害在全年中发生最多、繁殖最快、危害最大的季节。据河北、山东、江苏、湖南等四省不完全统计，发生各种病虫的农田已达九千七百余万亩。不少病虫害由于气候适宜而比去年严重得多。辽宁省发生粘虫的面积，比这个省过去发生粘虫最严重的1955年大三倍。长江流域第三代三化螟来势很猛。玉米螟、棉铃虫、金刚钻、大豆造桥虫、稻瘟病、菜病等病虫均有严重发展的趋势。在虫害比较严重的一些县份，都有成千成万的公社社员，在深入第一线的各级干部领导和帮助下，划片分块，猛攻巧打，对虫害进行了及时的坚决的斗争，取得了巨大的战果。现在，许多地区病虫害还在继续发生，大家还须继续奋战，反复防治，不到最后胜利决不罢休。
    对病虫害作斗争的最有利的时机是病虫害的初发时期。越早动手防治，越省人力物力，可收事半功倍之效。最近一个时期危害最普遍、最严重的是粮棉作物的各种钻心虫，这种害虫从卵块孵化出来，很快钻入作物内部为害。根据以往的经验，要有效地防治这些害虫，特别要注意迅速摸清虫情，抓住要害，争取时间，以巧制胜。同样的劳力、药剂，早治和晚治的效果相差很大。据在河南、河北、山东三省十一个防治棉虫卓著成效的人民公社的调查，这些公社防治病虫害的工作动手早、规模大、质量高，绝大部分棉田基本上没有发生卷叶、红叶和破叶现象，因虫害脱落的蕾铃一般占2％—7％，比去年同期减少二分之一以上。这十一个公社消灭棉铃虫、减少蕾铃脱落的主要经验，就在于始终掌握虫情，及时大捕蛾卵，在害虫产卵盛期及时打药，把幼虫消灭在钻入棉铃以前。当前病虫发生的一大特点是发生面广，必须根据虫情的变化，抓住主攻对象，把人力、农药用在刀口上。对病虫发生情况要进行排队，抓住数量最多、危害最大的病虫首先除治；还要进行田块排队，丰产田先于一般田，病虫重的田先于病虫轻的田。为了使有限的药剂发挥最大的效力，要合理用药，节约用药，土洋农药同样重视。为了确保普遍地、彻底地消灭病虫害，要实行防治病虫责任制，从查虫到治虫，负责到底，贯彻始终，保质保量。
    在防治病虫害工作中，各级领导干部要深入田间，参加战斗，指挥战斗；要以丰产田的病虫防治工作作榜样，把一般田的病虫防治工作推动起来。在各种作物中，首先要狠抓、大抓粮食病虫的防治工作；当然，棉花、油料、蔬菜和其他经济作物病虫害的防治也不能放松。对于丰产田以外的每一块庄稼，包括在零星土地上和新垦荒地上种植的，都要保收。既然多种了，就要把它管好、保好，以求达到多收的目的。再说，如果不注意全面防治，如果病虫在任何一块田地里盛发起来，都会蔓延开来，对已经防治的地里的庄稼仍会造成损害。因此，我们的口号是：哪里发生病虫，就把它消灭在哪里。这就是在植保工作中具体体现多种多收和高产多收同时并举的方针，体现以粮为纲、发展多种经营的方针。
    目前农业生产战线形势很好，全党全民已掀起大办农业、大办粮食的高潮。就防治病虫害这件工作来看，条件也更加有利了：今年药械比往年准备得更充分；各地都有防治大秋作物病虫害的丰富经验；许多人民公社都建立了治虫专业队，病虫预测站，病虫情报员。只要各级领导部门真正把防治病虫工作提到议事日程上来，加强领导，充分发动群众，及早动手，就能彻底消灭病虫害，夺取秋季丰收。
