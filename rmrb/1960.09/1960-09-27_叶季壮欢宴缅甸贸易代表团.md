Xinhua News Agency, 26th - Ye Jizhuang, Minister of Foreign Trade of the People's Republic of China, held a banquet tonight to warmly welcome all members of the Burmese Trade Delegation led by U Mya, Member of Parliament of the Union of Burma.
    U Hla Aung, Ambassador of the Union of Burma to China, attended tonight's banquet.
    Ye Jizhuang said at the banquet: "China and Burma are friendly neighbors. Our two countries jointly advocated the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. For many years, our two countries have developed friendly relations and economic and trade relations under the guidance of these principles. Especially since the beginning of this year, the mutual visits of the Prime Ministers of the two countries, the signing of the Sino-Burmese Treaty of Friendship and Mutual Non-Aggression, and the smooth resolution of the Sino-Burmese border issue have brought the friendly relations between China and Burma into a new stage."
    Ye Jizhuang said: "China and Burma are geographically connected, transportation is convenient, and both are rich in resources. Both are carrying out economic construction, and there are many materials that can be exchanged between the two sides, which opens up broad avenues for the development of economic and trade relations between our two countries. In the past few years, trade between our two countries has greatly developed on the basis of equality, mutual benefit, and mutual exchange of goods. We firmly believe that with the development of friendly relations between China and Burma, economic and trade relations between the two countries will be further developed."
    U Mya, head of the Burmese Trade Delegation, said at the banquet: "China and Burma have a long history of friendly relations. We believe that in the future, our two countries will continue to get along friendly with each other. Under the guidance of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, and under the wise leadership of our two countries' leaders, our two countries will surely embark on the destination we want to go. Burma has abundant resources, but construction has just begun. In order to develop Burma's economy, we need brotherly support from China. We will promote the relations between our two countries. Soon, our two countries will sign the Sino-Burmese border treaty. We are very happy."
    Present at tonight's welcome banquet were Lei Renmin and Lu Xuzhang, Vice Ministers of Foreign Trade of the People's Republic of China, directors of relevant bureaus of the Ministry of Foreign Trade, and managers of various import and export corporations. Peng Jinbo, Commercial Counselor of the Chinese Embassy in the Union of Burma, also attended the banquet.
    Before the banquet, Minister Ye Jizhuang met with all members of the Burmese Trade Delegation.
