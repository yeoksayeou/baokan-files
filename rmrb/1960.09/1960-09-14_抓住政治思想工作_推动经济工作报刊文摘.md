	Grasping Production Starts with Ideology, Grasping Ideology Starts with Production
    Production and construction work is done by people. Whether it is done with full energy, in a faster, better, and more economical way, or with insufficient energy, in a slower, worse, and more wasteful way, there are different mental states involved. In the process of work, difficulties and problems are always encountered. There are different attitudes towards these difficulties and problems: some are advanced, some are backward; some are innovative, some are conservative; some are positive, some are passive. People's mental state and their attitude towards difficulties have a direct impact on the development of production. Therefore, grasping production must start with ideology. Production and construction work is concrete, difficulties and problems are concrete, and people's ideological understanding is also concrete. The improvement of people's ideological understanding is the precursor to the development of economic work. If we are divorced from the actual conditions of economic work itself, we cannot find the objective basis for the emergence of ideological problems, and we cannot use ideological leaps to closely promote the leaps in production and construction work. Therefore, grasping ideology must start from production.

    Grasping production from an ideological perspective means that when we undertake a new production task, we should not only analyze the material and technical conditions and specific difficulties and problems in production, but also focus on analyzing the masses' understanding of this task and their attitude towards difficulties. Which understandings are correct and which are incorrect? Which views and practices are in line with the requirements of more, faster, better, and more economical results, and which are not? Only in this way can we inspire and organize the enthusiasm of the masses and rely on them to consciously complete this task and move towards new goals. For a leader, it is important to be good at seeing ideological problems in complex technical problems and using political work to lead economic work, always holding the red flag of the general line to do all work well. If we do not start from analyzing the masses' thinking, but only generally explain the significance of completing this task, mobilizing and issuing instructions from top to bottom, instead of making specific analyses of specific ideological problems from bottom to top, then advanced ideas will not be discovered, ideological obstacles cannot be quickly eliminated, and the masses' ideological awareness will not be raised. If we only grasp production and not ideology, and our minds are full of raw materials, equipment figures, and indicators, thinking that these are material forces, and we do not see that people are the decisive factor in developing production, and that the vast masses with a high degree of awareness are the most important material force, then he will not be able to fully exert subjective initiative to overcome various unfavorable material conditions.

    The No. 2 converter workshop of Shanghai Steel Plant No. 3 is a clear example. In the past, the No. 1 smelting furnace in this workshop had high sulfur content, low melting rate, and short furnace life, producing only about ten tons of molten iron per hour on average. People called it the "Old Master Furnace." But now it has achieved low sulfur content, high melting rate, and long furnace life, melting an average of 18.5 tons of molten iron per hour, with an average desulfurization rate of 65%, and a furnace life of 260 heats, far exceeding other large smelting furnaces, becoming a pacesetter in Shanghai's steel-grabbing battle. People call it the "Red Flag Furnace." Why did the "Old Master Furnace" become the "Red Flag Furnace"? Did the equipment conditions change? No. Did the number of personnel increase? No. But people's thinking has indeed changed. In the past, the leadership only focused on production and not on ideology. The workers saw that the "Old Master Furnace" only had four small blowers, and the air ducts were leaking, so they lacked confidence. The leadership was also only busy grasping production targets, and did not really understand what the key to production was and solve the ideological problems existing among the masses. As a result, output has not been able to increase. When the Party Branch Secretary took off his shoes and went down to the field to personally plant "experimental plots" at Furnace No. 1, acting as both a fighter and a commander, pushing carts and transporting materials with the workers in the storm, and operating with the workers by the furnace in the high heat, changing the past method of leaders arranging tasks before and after shifts, and the masses checking after shifts, and instead adopting the method of discussing matters with the masses, letting the masses discuss themselves, summarize experiences, exchange technology, and help each other, the workers' evaluation of the furnace chief was: from "managing" to "helping", from "watching" to "doing", their enthusiasm was aroused. They said: "We can turn an old ox into a swift horse", "We are not afraid of the furnace being 'old master', as long as our thinking is not 'old master'", and with eighteen people united as one, they finally promoted advanced operating methods and broke through technical bottlenecks. The ideological outlook of the people has changed, and the face of production has also changed.

    Grasping ideology starting from production means that we must be good at discovering common ideological problems in production, and then use the solution of ideological problems to powerfully promote production. Production practice is a broad field of activity for the masses. Without the production practice of the masses, without the production site, it is impossible to know what the masses are thinking and what ideological problems they have. Moreover, production is constantly developing, difficulties and problems in production are constantly emerging, and people's ideological understanding is also constantly changing. Leaving the reality of production, it is impossible to grasp the pulse of the masses' thinking. Therefore, we strengthen ideological work and adhere to putting politics in command, which means planting the command flag in every workshop, every team, and even every person, doing ideological work according to the time, place, and person. Taking Furnace No. 1 as an example, in the past, this furnace often experienced the "three lights" phenomenon, that is, the front furnace ran out of material, the back furnace ran out of material, and the converter ran out of material, which not only directly affected the output of the smelting furnace, but also caused production to be out of sync between shifts. What was the reason? After analysis and research by the Party branch, it was found that the problem lay in the departmentalism of cadres and the masses, each taking care of their own. The labor organization and production management were also unreasonable. At that time, all eighteen people in the furnace were managed by three shifts, and they did not communicate with each other. The furnace chief only managed the front furnace and could not manage the back furnace. The Party branch, on the one hand, exposed the consequences of departmentalism in production, educating the masses to recognize the importance of mutual cooperation, and on the other hand, implemented the method of "one shift contracting one furnace," decentralizing management authority to the furnace chief. As a result, there emerged a situation where eighteen people were united as one, the front furnace and the back furnace were united as one, chasing each other, helping each other, and promoting each other. In the past, the air ducts leaked severely and could not be solved for a long time. After the masses were mobilized, they took the initiative to check for air leaks and plug them, increasing the amount of air blown into the smelting furnace by 50%, doubling the life of the furnace, and increasing the melting rate by more than 30%. From this, it can be seen that starting from production means conducting specific analyses of the problems existing in production, not grasping ideology abstractly away from the reality of production, nor solving problems on a case-by-case basis, but raising the problems existing in production to the level of ideological understanding for resolution, and fully exerting enthusiasm to overcome the obstacles in the leap forward on the premise that the masses have a consistent understanding and are acting consciously.

	Bring Political and Ideological Work Deep into the Front Lines
    Political work is the lifeline of all economic work. Increasingly detailed economic work requires increasingly detailed political and ideological work to guarantee it. Without in-depth and meticulous, lively and vigorous political and ideological work, economic work has no soul and no foundation, and it is unlikely to become more and more detailed. Leaders of our industrial and mining enterprises fully understand this principle. However, for some enterprise leaders, understanding is one thing, and actually doing it is another. This is not to say that they are unwilling to do so, or do not want to do so, but rather that they are a bit "unable to find the way in." Is it difficult to enter this door? Not difficult. As long as we go deep down, to the front lines, and live and work with the masses, the problem will be easier to solve. Here, depth is the prerequisite. Only when we are deep can we be detailed, and conversely, detail requires further depth. Only when political and ideological work is deep and detailed can it be done in a lively and vigorous manner. People often say: To do ideological work well, we must first understand the ideological activities of the masses. If we do not go deep down, do not become one with the masses, and do not know and understand the ideological activities of the masses deeply, political and ideological work will lose its practical and concrete object, or become an empty thing. How can it be done well?

    Moreover, political and ideological work must be combined with economic work, and cannot be done in isolation. If political and ideological work is divorced from economic work and not combined with solving specific problems one by one, then so-called political and ideological work is empty. Conversely, in solving specific problems, if we do not talk about ideology and have no guarantee of political and ideological work, then so-called specific problems are difficult to solve. Why do we say this? Because things are often like this: there are ideological problems in specific problems, and there are specific problems in ideological problems. For example, in the technical innovation and technical revolution movement, almost every enterprise has created many advanced experiences. However, some advanced experiences have not been promoted, or have been promoted very slowly. If we ask the reason, there are only two aspects: one is the ideological problem, that is, there is a struggle between advanced and conservative thinking, or in other words, advanced thinking has not completely defeated conservative thinking. The other is the practical problem, that is, there are some specific problems that need to be solved in the promotion. Therefore, this requires us to conduct in-depth and meticulous investigation and research, clarify the ideological problems and specific problems, and solve them at the same time. Only in this way can things be handled well and well. The following example from the Xishan Mining Bureau is very convincing: The Guandi Mine had more vehicle derailment accidents due to poorly maintained transportation lines, which affected the increase in raw coal production. Why were the transportation lines poorly maintained? The reason was that the line maintenance workers were not at ease with their work. This is of course an ideological problem. However, there were also specific problems: there was no system or technical standard for line maintenance. From this fact, it can be seen that the main problem is that the line maintenance workers have ideological problems. As long as this problem is solved, the derailment accident problem will be relatively easy to solve. Of course, the system problem must also be solved at the same time. Because only when both aspects of the problem are solved can the problem be completely solved. The fact is also true. When the leaders of the Guandi Mine helped the maintenance workers solve these two aspects of the problem, the daily coal transportation capacity here increased from about 2,000 tons to more than 3,000 tons, and this line maintenance team also became an advanced team in the entire mine. It can be seen that solving specific problems must start with strengthening political work and solving ideological problems, and solving ideological problems must be combined with solving specific problems in production. The practice of separating political and ideological work from solving specific problems should be prevented and opposed.

    抓住政治思想工作  推动经济工作报刊文摘	  抓生产从思想入手抓思想从生产出发
    生产和建设工作，是要人去做的，是鼓足干劲、多快好省地做，还是干劲不足、少慢差费地做，这里面就有不同的精神状态存在。在工作进行的过程中，又总会遇到困难和问题，怎样去对待这些困难和问题，又有着不同的态度：有先进，也有落后；有革新，也有保守；有积极，也有消极。人们的精神状态和对困难所采取的态度，对于生产的发展不能不有着直接的影响，因此抓生产必须从思想入手。而生产和建设工作是具体的，困难和问题是具体的，人们的思想认识问题也是具体的，人们思想认识的提高，是经济工作赖以开展的先导，要想做好思想工作，离开了经济工作本身存在的状况，就找不到产生思想问题的客观依据，就不能以思想的跃进紧紧促进生产建设工作的跃进，所以说，抓思想又要从生产出发。
    所谓抓生产从思想入手，就是说，当我们去完成一项新的生产任务的时候，不仅要分析生产中的物质技术条件和各种具体的困难和问题，而且要着重分析广大群众对待这个任务的认识和对困难的态度，哪些认识是正确的，哪些认识则是不正确的；哪些看法和做法是符合多快好省要求的，哪些则是不符合多快好省要求的。这样，才有可能去启发和组织群众的积极性，依靠群众去自觉地完成这一任务，奔向新的目标。对于一个领导者来说，重要的是要善于从错综复杂的技术问题中看到思想问题，用政治工作去统率经济工作，自始至终掌握总路线这面红旗去做好一切工作。如果不是从分析群众思想入手，只是一般地阐明完成这一任务的意义，自上而下地作动员、发指示，而不是自下而上地对具体思想问题作出具体分析，这样先进思想不会被发现，思想障碍不能迅速扫除，群众的思想觉悟也就不会提高。如果只抓生产不抓思想，满脑子里只有原料材料，设备数字和指标，以为这些才是物质力量，而看不到人是发展生产的决定性因素，有高度觉悟的广大群众，才是最重要的物质力量，那么，他就不能够充分发挥主观能动性去克服不利的各种物质条件。
    上钢三厂二转炉车间就是一个明显的例子。这个车间的一号化铁炉过去是：硫高、熔化率低、炉龄短，平均每小时只出十吨左右的铁水，人们称它为“老爷炉”。可是，现在已做到硫低、熔化率高、炉龄长，平均每小时可以熔化铁水十八点五吨，平均去硫率达到65％，炉龄也达到二百六十炉，远远超过其他大型化铁炉，成为上海市夺钢大战中的一个标兵，人们称它为“红旗炉”。为什么“老爷炉”会变为“红旗炉”呢？设备条件变了吗？没有。人员增加了吗？也没有。但是人们的思想状况确实改变了。由于在过去，领导上只抓生产，不抓思想，工人看到“老爷炉”只有四只小鼓风机，风管还漏风，信心不足，领导也只是忙于抓生产指标，不去切切实实地了解生产关键是什么和解决群众中存在的思想问题，因而产量一直跃不上去。当党总支书记赤脚下田，到一号炉亲自种“试验田”，既当战斗员又当指挥员，在急风暴雨中和工人一起推车运料，在炉边高热时和工人一起操作，改变过去班前班后领导布置任务，班后群众检查的方法，而采取遇事同群众商量，让群众自己议论，总结经验，交流技术，互相帮助，工人对炉长的评价是：从“管”到“帮”，从“看”到“干”，积极性被激发起来了，他们说：“我们能把老黄牛变千里马”，“不怕炉子‘老爷’，只要我们思想不‘老爷’”，十八个人一条心，终于推广先进操作方法，攻破技术关键。人的思想面貌改变了，生产面貌也就跟着改变了。
    所谓抓思想从生产出发，就是说，要从生产中善于发现带有普遍性的思想认识问题，又通过思想问题的解决，去有力地推动生产。生产实践是群众广阔的活动场所，离开了群众的生产实践，离开了生产现场，就不可能知道群众在想些什么，有什么思想问题。而且生产是不断发展的，生产中的困难和问题是不断出现的，人们的思想认识也在不断变化，离开生产实际，就摸不到群众的思想脉搏。因此，我们加强思想工作，坚持政治挂帅，就是要把帅旗插到每个车间、每个小组，以至每个人，因时、因地、因人制宜地去做思想工作。仍以一号化铁炉为例，过去这座炉常常发生“三光”现象，就是前炉放光，后炉化光，转炉倒光，不仅直接影响了化铁炉的产量，而且也造成班与班间生产脱节。原因在哪里？经过党支部的分析、研究，发现问题在于干部与群众中有各顾各的本位主义思想，劳动组织和生产管理上也不合理。那时全炉十八个人，分属三个班来管理，彼此不通气，炉长也只管前炉，管不了后炉。党支部一方面揭露本位主义在生产上造成的后果，教育群众认识相互协作的重要，同时实行了“一个班包开一只炉”的办法，把管理权限下放给炉长，于是就出现了十八个人一条心，前炉后炉一条心，你追我赶，互相帮助，互相促进的局面。过去风管漏风很厉害，长期不能解决，群众发动起来后，便主动查漏风，堵漏风，使吹入化铁炉的风量增加了50％，炉子寿命延长了一倍，熔化率提高了30％以上。从这里可以看出，从生产出发，就是要对生产中存在的问题进行具体分析，不是离开生产实际抽象地抓思想，也不是就事论事地去解决问题，而是把生产中存在的问题，提到思想认识上来解决，在群众认识一致，出于自觉的前提下，充分发挥积极性，去克服跃进中的障碍。
    （摘自上海《解放》1960年第十七期闻永文）	  把政治思想工作深入到第一线
    政治工作是一切经济工作的生命线，越来越细的经济工作，要求有越做越细的政治思想工作做保证；没有深入细致、生动活泼的政治思想工作，经济工作就没有灵魂，就没有根基，越做越细也就不大可能。这个道理我们工矿企业的领导干部是完全懂得的。但是，对于一些企业的领导干部来说，懂得是一回事，实际做又是一回事。这倒并不是说他们不愿这样去做，不想这样去做，而是有点“不得其门而入”。入这个门难不难呢？不难。只要深入下去，到第一线去，同群众生活在一起，劳动在一起，问题就比较好办。在这里，深是前提。深了，才能细，反过来，细又要求再深；只有深了，细了，政治思想工作才能做得生动活泼。人们常说：要做好思想工作，必先了解群众的思想活动。如果不深入下去，不同群众打成一片，对群众的思想活动不深知深解，政治思想工作就失去了切实具体的对象，或者成了空洞的东西，那怎么可能做好呢？
    还有，政治思想工作必须结合着经济工作一道去做，不能孤立地去做。如果政治思想工作脱离开经济工作，不和解决一个个的具体问题相结合，那么，所谓政治思想工作，就是空的了；反过来，在解决具体问题中，如果不谈思想，没有政治思想工作做保证，所谓具体问题也就很难解决。为什么这样说呢？因为事情往往是这样：具体问题中有思想问题，而思想问题中又有具体问题。打个比方，在技术革新和技术革命运动中，差不多每个企业都创造了许多先进经验。但是，有些先进经验却没有推广开，或者推广得很慢。如果追问原因，不外这样两个方面：一是思想问题，即先进思想和保守思想有斗争，或者说，先进思想还没有彻底战胜保守思想。一是实际问题，即推广中有一些具体问题需要解决。所以，这就需要我们进行深入细致的调查研究，弄清思想问题和具体问题，并且把它们同时解决。只有如此，事情才能好办、办好。西山矿务局如下这个事例，很有说服力：官地矿因为运输线路维护得不好，车辆落道事故较多，影响到原煤产量的提高。为什么运输线路维护得不好呢？原因是线路维护工人不安心工作。这当然是思想问题。但是，也有具体问题：线路维修没有制度，没有技术标准。从这个事实中看，主要是线路维护工人有思想问题，只要这个问题得到解决，落道事故问题就比较好解决了。当然，制度问题也必须同时解决。因为只有把这两方面的问题都解决了，问题才能算彻底解决。事实也正是这样，当官地矿领导干部帮助维修工人解决了这两方面的问题之后，这里的日运煤能力即由两千吨左右，提高到三千吨以上，而这个线路维修小组，也一跃而成为全矿的先进小组了。可见，解决具体问题，必须从加强政治工作，从解决思想问题入手，而解决思想问题，又必须结合解决生产中的具体问题。那种把政治思想工作和解决一个个具体问题分割开来的做法，应该防止和反对。
