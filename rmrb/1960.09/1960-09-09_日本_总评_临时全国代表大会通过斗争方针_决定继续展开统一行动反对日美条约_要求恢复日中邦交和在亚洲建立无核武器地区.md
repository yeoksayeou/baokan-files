Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 8th. The Sixteenth Extraordinary National Convention of the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan (Sohyo), with 3.7 million members, adopted today at its closing session a policy for the autumn and year-end struggles. It stipulates that the powerful trade union will launch the 23rd national unified action on September 15, centering on the abolition of the new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" and the defense of peace and democracy.

The fighting policy states: From autumn to next spring, Sohyo will launch a new offensive against monopoly capital and the Ikeda Cabinet, which is the direct regime that undertakes the expectations of U.S.-Japan monopoly capital.

The policy stipulates that comprehensive unified actions should be launched from September 15, supported by various struggles such as safeguarding the workers' right to live, abolishing the new "Security Treaty," and defending peace and democracy, so that the workers' struggles can be further developed during the extraordinary session of the Diet and the general election.

To this end: 1. Sohyo will suggest that the "National Conference to Prevent Revision of the Security Treaty" hold a national representative conference in early September;

2. The 23rd unified action to abolish the new "Security Treaty" will be launched on September 15, and "regional rallies against military bases and demanding the withdrawal of U.S. troops" will be held around various bases nationwide;

3. The 24th unified action will be held around October 15, and national rallies will be held to demand that the extraordinary session of the Diet prepare a disarmament budget and demand the restoration of Japan-China diplomatic relations.

The fighting policy also points out that the general election to be held in November is a continuation of the struggle against the "Security Treaty." Sohyo will fight with the goal of achieving victory. In order to win the general election, it is necessary to strengthen work in rural areas, unite with farmers, and establish a national worker-farmer conference in mid-October, and to develop unified actions to abolish the new "Security Treaty" and protect the people's livelihood.

Speaking of the struggle of the Miike coal miners, the fighting policy states that Sohyo will hold a national mass rally in Omuta City at the end of September to support the continued struggle of the Miike coal miners. The policy also states that Sohyo will further develop the fundraising campaign and dispatch many workers from all over the country to help the Miike coal miners.

The fighting policy also points out that in promoting the anti-poverty movement, it is necessary to cooperate closely with people from all walks of life. The policy advocates the establishment of a national liaison conference to fight for the maintenance of life and health, the improvement of the social insurance system, tax cuts, and lower prices.

The conference also adopted a resolution on launching a nationwide movement to demand the restoration of Japan-China diplomatic relations. The resolution stated: "Sohyo is determined to become a major force in the movement to demand the restoration of Japan-China diplomatic relations, to demand the establishment of a nuclear-free zone in Asia, to demand the restoration of China's legitimate seat in the United Nations, and to strive for the abolition of the 'Security Treaty'. Sohyo will launch a signature campaign, hold rallies and demonstrations to promote the realization of these goals."

The conference also passed resolutions demanding that the Japanese government agree to an unconditional extension of the agreement on the repatriation of Korean residents in Japan, and opposing the establishment of missile bases on Niijima Island.

The conference declaration stated that Sohyo will further strengthen the struggle by "firmly linking the demands for safeguarding the workers' right to live with the demands of the whole nation, such as abolishing the new Security Treaty and restoring Japan-China diplomatic relations."

Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 7th. The 16th Extraordinary National Convention of the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan (Sohyo) was held in Tokyo today. Kaoru Ota, chairman of the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan, spoke at the conference. He called for the rapid unity of all workers in the trade union in order to confront the government and monopoly capital's attacks on the workers. He said that in order to carry out this task, the General Council of Trade Unions should prevent the reactionaries from promoting the policies of "economic cooperation with the United States" and "trade liberalization".

Kaoru Ota attached great importance to the struggle of the Miike miners. He emphasized that the Miike coal miners taught all capitalists a lesson, letting them know that it is not easy to dismiss workers.

Akira Iwai, Secretary-General of the Sohyo Secretariat, made a report on the policy for the autumn and year-end struggles at the conference. He said: Sohyo will "launch a nationwide unified movement with actions to abolish the new Security Treaty as its pillar." To this end, the 23rd national unified action will be held on the 15th. He also said that at the same time, efforts should be made to promote struggles to demand higher wages, shorter working hours, the establishment of a minimum wage system, and improvements to the social insurance system.

Shigeru Hara, chairman of the Japan Coal Miners' Union, reported to the conference on the results of the Coal Miners' Union conference that ended yesterday. He said, "The Japan Coal Miners' Union conference did not decide whether the Coal Miners' Union would accept the mediation plan, but instead emphasized condemning this bad mediation plan."

In explaining the contents of yesterday's decision, he said, "The Japan Coal Miners' Union demands a full guarantee of the livelihood of the 1,200 Miike members on the company's dismissal list and their full re-employment. If this demand is not met, the Japan Coal Miners' Union is prepared to call for another strike." He also said that the Japan Coal Miners' Union will only decide to end the Miike coal mine struggle after these demands are accepted.

Speakers at the conference included guests from various organizations, including Tomomi Narita, chairman of the Policy Affairs Research Council of the Japan Socialist Party, Satomi Hakamada, member of the Presidium of the Central Committee of the Japanese Communist Party, and Tokuji Kameda, Secretary-General of the All-Japan Farmers Association.

    日本“总评”临时全国代表大会通过斗争方针
    决定继续展开统一行动反对日美条约
    要求恢复日中邦交和在亚洲建立无核武器地区
    新华社8日讯　东京消息：日本工会总评议会第十六次临时全国代表大会今天在闭幕会议上通过的秋季和年终斗争的方针规定，这个拥有三百七十万会员的强大工会将以废除新日美“安全条约”和保卫和平与民主为中心，在9月15日展开第二十三次全国统一行动。
    斗争方针说：在秋天到明年春天期间，“总评”要对垄断资本和池田内阁展开新的攻势。池田内阁是承担起美日垄断资本的期望的嫡系政权。
    方针规定要以维护工人生活权利、废除新“安全条约”和保卫和平与民主等各种斗争为支柱，从9月15日起展开全面的统一行动，以使工人的斗争在国会临时会议到大选期间获得进一步的发展。
    为此，一、“总评”将建议“阻止修改安全条约国民会议”在9月上旬举行全国代表会议；
    二、要在9月15日展开废除新“安全条约”第二十三次统一行动，并且在全国各基地周围举行“反对军事基地、要求撤退美军的各地区集会”；
    三、10月15日前后举行第二十四次统一行动，并且举行要求国会临时会议编制裁军预算和要求恢复日中邦交的全国性集会。
    斗争方针并且指出：将于11月举行的大选是反对“安全条约”斗争的继续。“总评”要以取得胜利为目标，进行斗争。为了争取在大选中获得胜利，要加强对农村地区的工作，团结农民，并且在10月中旬成立全国性工农会议；发展废除新“安全条约”、保卫国民生活的统一行动。
    谈到三池煤矿工人的斗争时，斗争方针说，“总评”将在9月底在大牟田市举行全国群众大会，以支持三池煤矿工人继续斗争。方针还说，“总评”将进一步发展募捐运动，并将从全国各地派遣许多工人帮助三池煤矿工人。
    斗争方针还指出，在推动反对贫困的运动中，应当同各阶层人民密切合作。方针主张成立为维护生活和健康、争取改善社会保险制度、减税和降低物价而斗争的国民联络会议。
    代表大会还通过了关于展开要求恢复日中邦交的全国性运动的决议。决议说：“‘总评’决意要在要求恢复日中邦交，要求在亚洲建立无核武器地区，要求恢复中国在联合国中的合法地位和争取废除‘安全条约’的运动中成为主要力量。‘总评’将展开签名运动，举行集会和示威，以促进这些目标的实现。”
    大会还通过决议，要求日本政府同意无条件延长关于遣送旅日朝鲜侨民的协定，反对在新岛建立导弹基地。
    大会宣言表示“总评”今后要把维护工人生活权利的要求“牢固地同废除新安全条约、恢复日中邦交等全民性的要求连结在一起”进一步加强斗争。
    据新华社7日讯　东京消息：日本工会总评议会今天在东京召开第十六次临时大会。日本工会总评议会议长太田熏在大会讲话。他号召迅速团结工会的所有工人，以便对抗政府和垄断资本对工人的进攻。他说，为了执行这个任务，工会总评议会应当阻止反动派推行“同美国实行经济合作”和“贸易自由化”的政策。
    太田熏很重视三池矿工的斗争。他强调说，三池煤矿工人对一切资本家给以教训，使他们知道要解雇工人是不容易的。
    总评议会事务局长岩井章在大会上作了关于秋季和年末斗争方针的报告。他说：总评议会将“以争取废除新安全条约等行动为支柱，展开全国规模的统一运动”。为此，要在15日举行第二十三次全国统一行动。他又说，同时，应大力推进要求提高工资、缩短工作时间、建立最低工资制、改进社会保险制度等斗争。
    日本煤矿工会主席原茂向大会报告昨天结束的煤矿工会大会的结果。他说，“日本煤矿工会大会没有决定煤矿工会是否接受调停方案，而代之以强调谴责这个恶劣的调停方案。”
    他在解释昨天决定的内容时说，“日本煤矿工会要求完全保证在公司解雇名单上的一千二百名三池会员的生活以及他们完全被重新雇用。假若这个要求不被满足，日本煤矿工会准备再次号召罢工。”他又说，日本煤矿工会只有在这些要求被接受后，才决定结束三池煤矿的斗争。
    在大会上发言的有来自各个组织的来宾，其中包括日本社会党政策审议会会长成田知已，日本共产党中央委员会干部会委员袴田里见和全日本农民协会联合会书记长龟田德治。
