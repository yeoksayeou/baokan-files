Xinhua News Agency, September 26th dispatch from New York: The delegations of the United States and other Western powers attending the United Nations General Assembly are stepping up their extra-curricular activities, trying their best to cover up the ugly image of the United Nations as a tool of American aggression.

At a banquet on September 25th to entertain the representatives of the twelve newly admitted African countries and Cyprus, U.S. Secretary of State Herter proclaimed that the United Nations, which had recently been used by the United States to push its plan of aggression in the Congo, was "protecting" the "independence and territorial integrity" of these countries, and said that "we cannot stand by and watch its (the United Nations') influence shrink or weaken."

Herter also put on a Bodhisattva face to the representatives of the African countries, claiming that the United States "genuinely cares about helping" these countries "realize their natural desire to achieve social and economic development."

Canadian Prime Minister Diefenbaker, when arriving in New York on the evening of the 24th and answering reporters' questions, tried his best to defend Hammarskjöld's aggressive policy of swallowing the Congo on behalf of the United States in the Congo, saying: Canada "very much trusts his (Hammarskjöld's) attitude in performing his duties" and is "satisfied with the work he has done."

    新华社26日讯　纽约消息：出席联合国大会的美国和其他西方大国代表团正加紧进行会外活动，极力掩饰联合国作为美国侵略工具的丑态。
    美国国务卿赫脱25日在招待新被接纳加入联合国的非洲十二个国家和塞浦路斯的代表的宴会上，宣扬最近被美国利用来推行其侵略刚果的计划的联合国是“保护”这些国家的“独立和领土完整”的，并说“不能眼看着它（联合国）的影响缩小或削弱”。
    赫脱还向非洲国家的代表们装出一付菩萨面孔，声称美国“真正关心帮助”这些国家“实现取得社会和经济发展的自然愿望”。
    加拿大总理迪芬贝克24日晚到达纽约回答记者问题时，极力为哈马舍尔德在刚果奉行美国鲸吞刚果的侵略政策辩护，他说：加拿大“非常信任他（哈马舍尔德）在执行职责时的态度”，对“他所做的工作感到满意”。
