As the Congolese people are waging a heroic struggle to oppose imperialist aggression and interference and to defend the integrity of their homeland's territorial sovereignty, African independent states held a foreign ministers' conference in Léopoldville, the capital of the Republic of the Congo. The conference lasted seven days from August 25 to 31 and focused on the serious situation in the Congo caused by the armed aggression of the Belgian colonialists and the joint intervention of the imperialist bloc headed by the United States. The resolutions made by the conference on the situation in the Congo and assistance to the Republic of the Congo demonstrated the full support and assistance of the African peoples for the independence and territorial integrity of the Congo. The conference also decided that there was an urgent need to convene a summit conference of African independent states "to facilitate African independence and unity, and to facilitate the liberation, freedom and prosperity of all residents of Africa." There is no doubt that this Léopoldville African Independent States Foreign Ministers Conference has made beneficial contributions to the cause of African unity and independence.

The current Africa is in a historical period of vigorous upsurge of the colonial people's liberation movement and the collapse of the imperialist colonial system. In the first year of the 1960s, the African national independence movement presented an excellent situation, and African colonies are heading towards independence one after another at an unprecedented speed. A series of new independent countries have been born in Black Africa. Up to now, there are twenty-four independent African countries, and by the end of this year, it is expected that there will be twenty-six independent African countries. These countries account for two-thirds of the total area of Africa and three-quarters of the total population of Africa. This situation shows that the process of African countries moving from colonial status to independence through struggle will be greatly accelerated in the future. However, this does not mean that imperialism will easily give up its colonial interests and automatically withdraw from African colonies. On the contrary, the struggle between the African peoples and the imperialist colonialists has become more acute. The occurrence of the Congo incident is enough to prove that imperialist colonialists will never allow the African peoples to achieve genuine and complete national independence. Moreover, under certain conditions, imperialism will unite to jointly suppress the African national independence movement. Isn't that so? When the Congolese people rose up to demand the establishment of their own standing army and further development of their national independence, the Belgian colonialists launched a frantic armed attack on the young Republic of the Congo; and the imperialist forces headed by the United States quickly colluded to jointly suppress the Congolese people. Therefore, it is very clear that in the current very favorable situation of the African national independence movement, the African people need to be more vigilant, strengthen unity, and support each other in the struggle against imperialism and colonialism. Only in this way can they achieve and defend national independence until they finally eliminate all imperialist forces from Africa. Congolese Prime Minister Lumumba, at the closing session of this African Independent States Foreign Ministers Conference, called on the Congolese people and the African peoples to unite and remain vigilant in order to defeat the imperialist conspiracy against the independence and freedom of the Congo and other African countries. This call is obviously very timely and pertinent. Because this is a major enlightenment that the Congolese people have gained from the lessons of blood.

The Léopoldville conference reflected the desire of the African peoples to fully support the just struggle of their Congolese brothers, and showed that the unity of the African peoples cannot be shaken by the imperialist forces. Algerian delegation leader Yazid reaffirmed in his speech the support and solidarity of the Algerian people for the Republic of the Congo. Guinean delegation leader Diallo Telli Bamba emphasized in his speech the support of the Guinean government and people for the struggle of the Congolese government and people against imperialist conspiracies and sabotage. Ghanaian delegation leader Kozo Botsio also guaranteed the support of the Ghanaian government and people for the Republic of the Congo. Secretary-General of the All-African People's Conference, Diallo, pointed out that all African people support their Congolese brothers. The resolution of the conference expressed the following unanimous opinion of the African peoples: "Recognizing that the independence and sovereignty of the Republic of the Congo are unified and indivisible," and "declaring the need to maintain the territorial unity and integrity of the Republic of the Congo." The conference also "condemned all colonialist conspiracies aimed at splitting the territory of the Republic of the Congo."

Now, the Congolese people are waging a heroic and arduous struggle to safeguard the independence and sovereignty of their motherland and the integrity of their territory. The Congolese army is advancing towards Kasai Province and Katanga Province, which are occupied by imperialist agents and separatist elements. At the same time, imperialism headed by the United States, under the guise of the United Nations, is stepping up its major conspiracy to split and jointly manage the Congo. A week ago, the magazine "U.S. News & World Report" openly admitted in a commentary that "the UN forces will now take over the task that the Belgians have continued in this region of the world for eighty years." This is exactly the case, the "UN forces" manipulated by U.S. imperialism are rampaging and causing trouble in the Congo, hindering the Congolese government and army from exercising their sovereignty. The "UN forces" manipulated by the United States, who nominally came to the Congo at the "invitation" of the Congolese government, dared to occupy airports and dig trenches for defense on the territory of the Congo, prohibiting the Congolese army from entering; dared to openly shelter Belgian armed paratroopers and spies, hindering Congolese soldiers from searching; and dared to openly collude with the Tshombe traitor group and Belgian colonialists in Katanga Province to form a joint "committee" to jointly suppress the anti-colonialist struggle of the people of Albertville. And UN officials even turned around and accused the Congolese government of "openly violating" the agreement, claiming that the "UN forces" would "fire the first shot" at the Congolese army!

It is very clear that the seriousness of the Congo situation lies precisely in the fact that the old colonialists have not been completely driven out, and a more ferocious and insidious new colonialist—U.S. imperialism—has already squeezed in. Although U.S. imperialism has put on a cloak of "anti-colonialism" in front of the African people, the true colors of imperialism cannot be covered up. It is this U.S. imperialism, which has become the number one accomplice of the French colonialists in the massacre of the Algerian people, that not only has made every effort to shelter and support the armed attack launched by the Belgian colonialists against the Congolese people this time, but also directly used the United Nations to carry out interference and aggression against the Congo. What is even more vicious is that U.S. imperialism is also using the name of the United Nations to step up the implementation of its heinous plan of "using Africans to fight Africans" in the Congo. The purpose of U.S. imperialism is to finally replace the position of the Belgian colonialists and establish a new colonial rule in the Congo. Everyone knows that after the Second World War, the U.S. capital enslavement of the Congo has already begun, with U.S. capital reaching 600 million U.S. dollars, second only to Belgium. In recent years, the United States has plundered a large amount of resources from the Congo, reaching more than 100 million U.S. dollars in 1959 alone. And now, taking advantage of the weakening of the Belgian colonialists' position in the Congo, the monopoly capital of Wall Street is ambitiously pouring in. The "Wall Street Journal" bluntly stated: "The United States is considering importing dollars into this chaotic new country." It openly clamored that in order to "import dollars" to achieve the goal of capitalist enslavement of the Congo, the Congo must first become a "UN protectorate." This is a self-confession of U.S. imperialism's aggressive ambitions towards the Congo.

The African peoples certainly understand that the fate of the Congolese people is closely linked to the fate of the African peoples. The serious threat faced by the Congolese people from the imperialist aggression forces headed by the United States is a common threat to them; supporting the struggle of the Congolese people is also supporting their own cause of national independence. Today, the heroic struggle of the Congolese people is a major support and encouragement to the struggle of the people of the world, especially the African people, against imperialism. The impact of this struggle of the Congolese people on the African national independence movement will be immeasurable. Precisely because of this, the joint suppression and interference of the Congo by imperialism headed by the United States is essentially a frenzied counterattack and attack on the ever-rising African national independence movement. Guinean President Sékou Touré is right: there is a war in the Congo now. This war is a conflict between the African continent and the colonial rulers. Therefore, facing the serious threat of a common enemy, imperialism headed by the United States, what the African people urgently demand is to unite as one, pool all the forces that can be pooled, support each other, and fight together to crush the counterattack and attack of international imperialism headed by the United States, so as to enable the African national independence movement to achieve greater development.

The Chinese people regard the struggle of the Congolese people and the African peoples against imperialism and colonialism as a major support for ourselves; at the same time, the Chinese people will never begrudge their efforts and firmly support the struggle of the Congolese people and the African peoples to win and safeguard national independence. This time, Chen Jiakang, the Chinese ambassador to the United Arab Republic, also attended the Léopoldville conference as an observer, which also shows that with the increasingly close friendly relations between China and African countries, the mutual support between the Chinese and African peoples in the common struggle against imperialism will be further enhanced. We firmly believe that although the Congolese people and the African peoples will encounter various twists and turns and difficulties on the road ahead, the cause of the Congolese people and the African peoples to win and safeguard national independence will surely achieve final victory with the support of the people of the world.

### 加强团结，互相支援，共同斗争

    加强团结，互相支援，共同斗争
    正当刚果人民为反对帝国主义侵略和干涉，保卫祖国领土主权完整而进行英勇斗争的时候，非洲独立国家在刚果共和国的首都利奥波德维尔举行了外长会议。会议从8月25日至31日历时七天，集中地讨论了由于比利时殖民者的武装侵略和以美国为首的帝国主义集团的联合干涉所造成的刚果的严重形势。会议作出的关于刚果形势和援助刚果共和国等的决议，表明了非洲各国人民对于刚果独立和领土完整的充分的支持和援助。会议并且决定，迫切需要召开一次非洲独立国家的首脑会议，“以利于非洲的独立和团结，以利于非洲所有居民的解放、自由和繁荣。”毫无疑问，这次利奥波德维尔非洲独立国家外长会议，为非洲团结和独立的事业作出了有益的贡献。
    目前的非洲，正处于殖民地人民的解放运动蓬勃兴起，帝国主义殖民体系土崩瓦解的历史时期。二十世纪六十年代的第一个年头，非洲的民族独立运动呈现出一片大好形势，非洲殖民地正以空前未有的速度先后走向独立，一系列新的独立国家在黑非洲诞生了。到现在为止，非洲独立国家已达二十四个，而到今年年底为止，非洲独立国家预计将达到二十六个，这些国家的面积占全非洲总面积的三分之二，人口占非洲总人口的四分之三。这种情况表明，非洲各国人民通过斗争，从殖民地地位走向独立的过程，今后还将会大大加速。但是，这决不是说，帝国主义将会轻易地放弃殖民利益，自动地退出非洲殖民地。正相反，非洲各国人民和帝国主义殖民者之间的斗争更加尖锐化了。刚果事件的发生，就足以证明，帝国主义殖民者是决不允许非洲各国人民获得真正的彻底的民族独立的。而且在一定条件下，帝国主义会联合起来，对非洲民族独立运动进行共同的镇压。不是吗？当刚果人民起来要求建立自己的常备军和进一步发展自己国家独立的时候，比利时殖民者便对年青的刚果共和国发动了疯狂的武装进攻；而以美国为首的帝国主义势力也迅速勾结起来，对刚果人民实行共同镇压。因此，事情十分明白，在当前非洲民族独立运动十分有利的形势下，非洲人民需要更加提高警惕，加强团结，并在反对帝国主义、殖民主义的斗争中相互支援。只有这样，才能取得和捍卫民族独立，直到最后把帝国主义势力从非洲全部清除出去。刚果总理卢蒙巴在这次非洲独立国家外长会议的闭幕会上，号召刚果人民和非洲各国人民团结起来，并保持警惕，以击败帝国主义反对刚果和其他非洲国家的独立和自由的阴谋。这个号召显然是非常及时和中肯的。因为这是刚果人民从血的教训中得到的重大的启示。
    利奥波德维尔会议反映了非洲各国人民要求全力支持他们刚果兄弟的正义斗争的愿望，表明了非洲各国人民的团结是帝国主义势力所不可能动摇的。阿尔及利亚代表团团长亚齐德在发言中重新保证阿尔及利亚人民对刚果共和国的支持和声援。几内亚代表团团长迪亚洛·特利·邦巴卡在发言中强调几内亚政府和人民对刚果政府和人民反对帝国主义阴谋和破坏的斗争的支持。加纳代表团团长科佐·博齐约也保证加纳政府和人民对刚果共和国的支持。全非人民大会秘书长迪亚洛指出，全体非洲人民都支持他们的刚果兄弟。会议的决议表达了非洲各国人民的如下一致的意见：即“认为刚果共和国的独立和主权是统一而不可分割的”，并且“宣布有必要维护刚果共和国的领土统一和完整。”会议还“谴责一切目的在于分裂刚果共和国领土的殖民主义阴谋”。
    现在，刚果人民正在为维护祖国的独立和主权、领土的完整进行着英勇艰巨的斗争。刚果军队正在向帝国主义代理人、分裂主义分子所盘据的开赛省和加丹加省进军。但同时，以美国为首的帝国主义在联合国旗号的掩护下，正在加紧进行着分裂和共管刚果的重大阴谋。一个星期前，“美国新闻与世界报道”杂志在评论中公开承认，“联合国军现在将接管比利时人在世界这个地区继续了八十年的任务”。事实正是这样，美帝国主义操纵下的“联合国军”，正在刚果横行霸道地肇事生端，阻挠刚果政府和军队行使自己的主权。名义上应刚果政府“邀请”到刚果去的美国操纵下的“联合国军”，竟然在刚果的领土上占领机场，掘壕据守，禁止刚果军队入内；竟然公开庇护比利时的武装伞兵和间谍人员，阻挠刚果士兵的搜查；竟然敢于在加丹加省同冲伯卖国集团和比利时殖民者公开勾结，组成联合的“委员会”，共同镇压阿耳伯特维尔人民的反殖民主义斗争。而联合国的官员们竟然还反过来诬蔑刚果政府“公开侵犯”协定，扬言“联合国军”要对刚果军队“首先开第一枪”！
    十分清楚，刚果局势的严重性正是在于，旧的殖民者还没有被完全驱逐出去，而一个更加凶恶、更加阴险的新殖民主义者——美国帝国主义已经挤进来了。尽管美帝国主义在非洲人民面前披上了一件“反殖民主义”的外衣，但帝国主义的原形是遮盖不了的。就是这个成为法国殖民者屠杀阿尔及利亚人民的头号帮凶的美国帝国主义，这一次不仅竭力庇护和支持比利时殖民者对刚果人民发动的武装进攻，而且直接地利用联合国对刚果实行干涉和侵略。而更加恶毒的是，美帝国主义还利用联合国名义，加紧在刚果推行它的“用非洲人打非洲人”的罪恶计划。美帝国主义的目的就是要想最后取代比利时殖民者的地位，在刚果建立起新的殖民统治。谁都知道，第二次世界大战以后，美国对刚果的资本奴役早已开始，美国资本达到六亿美元，仅次于比利时而居第二位。近年来美国从刚果掠夺了大量的资源，仅仅1959年就达一亿美元以上。而现在趁着比利时殖民者的地位在刚果的削弱，华尔街的垄断资本正在野心勃勃地涌进去。“华尔街日报”露骨地说道：“美国正考虑向这个混乱的新国家输入美元”。它公然叫嚷，为了“输入美元”达到资本奴役刚果的目的，必须先使刚果成为“联合国的被保护者”。这就是美帝国主义对于刚果的侵略野心的自供状。
    非洲各国人民当然懂得，刚果人民的命运，是同非洲各国人民的命运紧密地联系在一起的，刚果人民所面临的来自以美国为首的帝国主义侵略势力的严重威胁，就是对于他们的共同威胁；对于刚果人民斗争的支持，也就是对于他们自己的民族独立事业的支持。今天，刚果人民的英勇斗争，是对全世界人民，特别是非洲人民反对帝国主义斗争的重大支持和鼓舞。刚果人民的这一场斗争，对于非洲民族独立运动所能发生的影响，将是无可估量的。正是因为这样，以美国为首的帝国主义对刚果的联合镇压和干涉，实质上也是对于不断高涨中的非洲民族独立运动的一次疯狂的反扑和进攻。几内亚共和国总统塞古·杜尔说得对：现在刚果存在着战争。这场战争是非洲大陆同殖民统治者的冲突。因此，面临着共同敌人、以美国为首的帝国主义的严重威胁，非洲人民迫切的要求是，团结一致，汇合一切可以汇合的力量，互相支援，共同斗争，粉碎以美国为首的国际帝国主义的反扑和进攻，从而使非洲民族独立运动得到更大的发展。
    中国人民把刚果人民和非洲各国人民反对帝国主义和殖民主义的斗争，看作是对于我们自己的一个重大支持；同时中国人民也绝不吝啬自己的努力，坚决支持刚果人民和非洲人民争取和维护民族独立的斗争。这一次，中国驻阿联的大使陈家康也以观察员的身份出席了利奥波德维尔的会议，这也就表明，随着中国和非洲国家友好关系的日益密切，中国人民和非洲人民在反对帝国主义的共同斗争中的相互支援也将得到更进一步的增进。我们深信，尽管刚果人民和非洲人民在前进的道路上，还会遇到种种波折和困难，但刚果人民和非洲各国人民争取和维护民族独立的事业在全世界人民的支持之下，是一定要获得最后胜利的。
