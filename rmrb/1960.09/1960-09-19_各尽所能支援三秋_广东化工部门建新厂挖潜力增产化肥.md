Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou. Guangdong Province's chemical industry departments are actively increasing fertilizer production to support the production of autumn-harvested crops in rural areas. Since August, fertilizer production in the Shaoguan and Zhanjiang regions has more than doubled compared to July.

After studying the policy of the whole Party and the whole people engaging in agriculture and grain production on a large scale, the employees of the province's chemical industry resolved to increase fertilizer production to support agricultural production. The chemical industry departments in the Shaoguan region are actively building small sulfuric acid plants and implementing the spirit of using indigenous methods. While building, they first used indigenous methods for production. Currently, the thirty-three sets of small contact-process sulfur production equipment in this area have basically been completed and put into production. Fertilizer production is increasing in a straight line. It increased by 167.5% in July compared to June, and more than doubled in August compared to July. The output in August exceeded the total output in the first half of the year. The Hainan District strengthened its leadership in fertilizer production and promoted comprehensive utilization. In August, it not only overfulfilled the fertilizer production plan by 1.4 times, but also increased the number of products. The Zhanjiang region strengthened sulfuric acid production on the one hand, and used bittern salt slag to replace sulfuric acid in fertilizer production on the other hand. As a result, the August fertilizer production plan was overfulfilled by 16.7%, and the output more than doubled compared to July.

    各尽所能支援三秋
    广东化工部门建新厂挖潜力增产化肥
    新华社广州讯　广东省化学工业部门积极增产化肥，支援农村秋熟作物的生产。8月份以来，韶关、湛江两地区的化肥产量，比7月增长了一倍多。
    全省化学工业的职工在学习了全党全民大办农业、大办粮食的方针以后，决心提高化肥产量支援农业生产。韶关地区的化学工业部门积极建设小型硫酸厂，并且贯彻土法上马的精神，一边建设，一边先用土办法生产。目前，这个地区的三十三套小型接触硫法生产设备，基本上都已配成套投入生产。化肥产量成直线上升，7月比6月增长167.5％，8月又比7月增加一倍多，8月份的产量超过了上半年产量的总和。海南区加强对化肥生产的领导，大搞综合利用，8月份不仅超额一点四倍完成化肥生产计划，产品也增加了好几种。湛江地区一方面加强硫酸生产，一方面利用苦卤盐渣代替硫酸生产化肥，因而使8月份的化肥生产计划超额16.7％完成，产量比7月份翻了一番多。
