　　Immediately Launch a Mass Movement to Save Coke and Coal
　　--Abstract of the "Metallurgical News" Editorial

　　From the current point of view, to further increase steel production significantly, the ironmaking sector must first supply more and better iron. To significantly increase pig iron production, more and better coke is required.

　　Since the beginning of this year, the coking sector has continued to leap forward. Can we have more coke to guarantee the increased production of more iron and steel? In addition to the vast number of workers in the coal sector who are working hard to increase coal production, the answer from the iron and steel system itself is also affirmative. Just two examples can illustrate this issue. First, the total coke ratio of small and medium-sized blast furnaces in various provinces and cities varies greatly. Yunnan Province is relatively advanced, using only 1.3 tons of coke to produce one ton of iron, but some provinces and cities exceed this figure significantly. Second, the coke ratio of large and medium-sized blast furnaces in key enterprises also varies greatly. Anshan Iron and Steel has the lowest coke ratio, using only more than 670 kilograms of coke to produce one ton of iron. Similarly, some blast furnaces exceed this figure significantly. If all provinces, cities, and key enterprises could learn from these two advanced units, a large amount of coke could be saved. There are two ways to tap the potential of coke and coal. One is that the coking sector should practice strict economy, make full use of coal, reduce losses, and improve the quality of coke, so as to produce more and better coke with the same amount of coal. The other is that the ironmaking sector should practice strict economy, strengthen management, and reduce the coke ratio, so as to produce more iron with less coke.

　　In order to increase coke production with less coal, the coking sector must earnestly strengthen the education of employees on the general line and running enterprises with diligence and thrift, and vigorously launch a mass movement to increase production and practice economy. Enterprise leaders should help employees calculate several accounts. The first account is coal washing. According to the experience of many units, washing raw coal before coking can remove 10%-20% of ash content and 60% of sulfur content; and for every 1% reduction in ash content in coke, the coke consumption for ironmaking can be reduced by 1.7%, and the production of high-quality iron can be increased by 2%-2.5% accordingly. The second account is the quality of coke. According to statistics from several units, about 300 kilograms of lump coke are turned into powder coke after several handling processes for one ton of inferior coke. This part of the powder coke cannot enter the blast furnace for ironmaking unless it is processed. This is a considerable loss! The third account is the recovery of fine coal. Washing coal will result in the loss of some fine coal, but can we reduce the loss? According to the experience of several units, as long as the recovery of fine coal is strengthened, the recovery rate can generally be increased by 5%, and 500 tons of fine coal can be saved for every 10,000 tons of coal washed. The fourth account is the loss in processing and transportation. Can the loss of coal and coke in the process of transportation and processing be reduced? According to the situation of several units, as long as serious measures are taken, it is entirely possible to reduce the loss by 10% or even more. By calculating the accounts, the employees of the coking sector can realize that saving coal and coke is not only beneficial to the coking sector in completing its own production plan, but more importantly, it is beneficial to the realization of the leap forward in the iron and steel industry and to the high speed of socialist construction.

　　Opening up the source of coking coal is also an important aspect of saving prime coking coal and increasing coke production. Many places have used lean coal, lignite, and other non-prime coking coals to make good coke. These experiences should continue to be well summarized, improved, and promoted.

　　The ironmaking sector should establish the idea of "cherishing coke as cherishing grain," calculate the coke ratio, and try every possible means to save coke and strive to produce more good iron with the same amount of coke. The main ways for blast furnaces to save coke are as follows: First, continue to implement the technical operating principle of "refined materials, large blast, and high temperature" to reduce the coke ratio in the furnace; Second, break superstitions, emancipate the mind, and broaden the source of coal, using white coal or completely using white coal to make iron in small blast furnaces; Third, strengthen management, reduce the loss of lump coke, and at the same time make full use of powder coke, processing and pressing the powder coke into lumps to replace lump coke for use; Fourth, improve the grade of ore and put refined materials into the furnace, which can also greatly save coke.

　　立即开展节约焦、煤的群众运动
　　——《冶金报》社论摘要
    从当前来看，钢产量要更大幅度上升，首先要求炼铁部门供应更多的铁更好的铁。为使生铁产量更大幅度上升，就要求有更多的焦炭，更好的焦炭。
    今年以来炼焦部门是继续跃进的形势。能不能有更多的焦来保证增产更多的铁和钢呢？除了煤炭部门的广大职工正在努力增产煤炭外，从钢铁系统本身来讲，答复也是肯定的。仅仅举出两个例子就可以说明这个问题。一是各省、市中小型高炉的全焦比，相差悬殊。云南省比较先进，炼一吨铁只用焦一点三吨，但是有的省、市超过这个数字很多。二是重点企业的大中型高炉的焦比也相差悬殊。鞍钢焦比最低，炼一吨铁只用焦六百七十多公斤，同样，有的高炉超过这个数字很多。如果所有的省、市，所有的重点企业都能向这两个先进单位看齐，就可以节约大量的焦炭。挖掘焦、煤潜力的办法有两条。一是炼焦部门厉行节约，充分利用煤炭，减少损耗，提高焦炭质量，用同样数量的煤炼出更多更好的焦。另一条是炼铁部门厉行节约，加强管理，降低焦比，用更少的焦炭炼更多的铁。
    为了少用煤炭增产焦炭，炼焦部门要对职工认真加强总路线和勤俭办企业的教育，大搞增产节约的群众运动。企业领导人员要帮助职工算几笔账。第一笔洗煤账。据很多单位的经验，原煤经过洗选再炼焦，可以洗掉10％—20％的灰分、60％的硫分；而焦炭中的灰分每降低1％，炼铁的焦炭消耗就可以降低1.7％，就可以相应地增产2％—2.5％的优质铁。第二笔焦炭质量账。根据几个单位的统计，一吨劣质焦经过几次捣运，大约有三百公斤块焦变成粉焦。这部分粉焦除非经过加工，不能进入高炉炼铁。这是不小的损失！第三笔精煤回收账。洗煤会损失一部分精煤，但能不能少损失一些？据若干单位的经验，只要加强精煤回收工作，一般可以提高回收率5％，每洗一万吨煤就可以少损失五百吨精煤。第四笔加工、运输损耗账。煤焦在运输、加工过程中的损耗能不能减少？根据几个单位的情况看，只要认真采取措施，损耗减少10％，甚至更多一些，是完全可以办到的。算一算账，就可以使炼焦部门的职工认识到：节约煤焦不仅是对炼焦部门完成自己的生产计划有利，而更重要的是对实现钢铁跃进有利，对社会主义建设的高速度有利。
    开辟炼焦煤源也是节约主焦煤、增产焦炭的一个重要方面。许多地方已经用瘦煤、褐煤以及其他非主焦煤炼成了好焦炭。这些经验应该继续很好地总结、提高、推广。
    炼铁部门应该树立“爱焦如爱粮”的思想，算焦比账，千方百计节约焦炭，力争用同样数量的焦炭，生产更多的好铁。高炉节约焦炭的途径主要有以下几个：第一，继续贯彻执行“精料、大风、高温”的技术操作方针，降低入炉焦比；第二，破除迷信，解放思想，广辟煤源，在小高炉上掺用白煤，或者完全用白煤炼铁；第三，加强管理，减少块焦的损失，同时充分利用粉焦，把粉焦经过加工压成块状，代替块焦使用；第四，提高矿石品位，精料入炉，这也可以大大节省焦炭。
