Xinhua News Agency, 29th: Prime Minister Ferhat Abbas of the Republic of Algeria, representative of the heroic Algerian people who hold high the banner of national liberation struggle, and the delegation of the Provisional Government of the Republic of Algeria led by him, arrived in Beijing by plane this afternoon. The distinguished guests were warmly welcomed by Premier Zhou Enlai and other state leaders, as well as hundreds of thousands of people from all walks of life in the capital, who lined the streets.

Prime Minister Ferhat Abbas is visiting our country at the special invitation of Premier Zhou Enlai for a friendly visit. In May of this year, the Chinese people warmly welcomed Vice Premier Belkacem of the Provisional Government of the Republic of Algeria. Today, Prime Minister Abbas once again brings the profound friendship of the fighting Algerian people. When Premier Zhou Enlai accompanied the distinguished guests in an open car through the urban area of Beijing, hundreds of thousands of workers, students, PLA soldiers, and fully armed militiamen who lined the streets waved flags and shouted earth-shattering cheers. They expressed the Chinese people's brotherly respect and firm support for the heroic Algerian people who are engaged in the anti-colonialist struggle.

Premier Zhou Enlai spoke at the airport, representing the Chinese government and people, extending the warmest welcome to Prime Minister Ferhat Abbas and all the distinguished Algerian guests.

When Premier Zhou Enlai spoke of the heroic Algerian people's just struggle against colonialism, he emphasized that the Algerian people's heroic and indomitable revolutionary spirit has set a brilliant example for the African people and won the deep sympathy and firm support of the Asian people and the people of the world.

Premier Zhou Enlai said that the victory of the Algerian people is our victory, and also a great victory for the people of the world against imperialism and colonialism. The Chinese government and the Chinese people have always deeply sympathized with and fully supported your just struggle unswervingly until you achieve the final and complete victory. He said that the close friendship between the Chinese and Algerian people is developing and consolidating day by day. This visit by the Prime Minister will surely make new contributions to the further development of friendship between China and Algeria.

In his speech, Prime Minister Ferhat Abbas warmly expressed the deep friendship of the Algerian people towards the Chinese people. He said that the infinite courage and unwavering enthusiasm of the Chinese people have set an inspiring example for the enslaved people. The Algerian people are pleased to have the Chinese people as their friends.

In his speech, Prime Minister Abbas strongly condemned the US imperialism and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization for supporting the French imperialists in carrying out a heinous war of aggression in Algeria. He pointed out with confidence that today the Algerian people are invincible, and tomorrow they will be victorious.

Prime Minister Abbas said that the Algerian people are proud to have supported the liberation of the African continent effectively while waging a persistent struggle to win their own inevitable liberation. He said that in the tenacious struggle against French colonialism, all free people of the world stand with us, and the great Chinese people also stand with us.

Today, the national flags of the People's Republic of China and the Republic of Algeria flew high over the capital airport. Huge welcome banners were hung on the airport buildings. At 4:20 pm, the plane landed at the capital airport. Amid warm applause, Prime Minister Ferhat Abbas stepped out of the cabin with a smile. Premier Zhou Enlai was the first to step forward to greet him. Those who stepped forward to greet him along with Premier Zhou Enlai included Vice Premiers of the State Council He Long, Chen Yi, Nie Rongzhen, Xi Zhongxun, Vice Chairmen of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress Guo Moruo, Saifudin, Cheng Qian, Panchen Erdeni Qoigyi Gyaincain, Lin Feng, Vice Chairmen of the National Committee of the CPPCC Chen Shutong, Bao Erhan, Vice Chairmen of the National Defense Council Zhang Zhizhong, Fu Zuoyi, President of the Supreme People's Court Xie Juezai, Procurator-General of the Supreme People's Procuratorate Zhang Dingcheng, Vice Ministers of Foreign Affairs Zhang Hanfu, Ji Pengfei, General Tan Zheng of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, President of the Chinese-African People's Friendship Association Liu Changsheng, Chairman of the Chinese Committee for Asian-African Solidarity Liao Chengzhi, and others. They warmly shook hands with Prime Minister Ferhat Abbas and other distinguished guests.

After the military band played the national anthems of the Republic of Algeria and the People's Republic of China, Prime Minister Ferhat Abbas, accompanied by Premier Zhou Enlai, reviewed the guard of honor. A group of Young Pioneers ran forward, presenting bouquets of flowers with welcoming intentions to Prime Minister Ferhat Abbas and to the members of the delegation of the Provisional Government of the Republic of Algeria: Minister of Interior Ben Tobbal Lakhdar, Director of the Prime Minister's Office Ben Yahia Mohamed, Director of Political Affairs of the Ministry of Information Boumendjel Ahmed, Director of Political Affairs of the Ministry of Interior Hahn Lamine, and other distinguished guests.

When Prime Minister Abbas and all the distinguished members of the delegation, accompanied by Premier Zhou Enlai and others, circled the field for a week to meet with the welcoming masses, the whole place was filled with cheers, colorful flags flying, and drums and music playing. Many gorgeously dressed young women ran forward to present flowers to the distinguished guests. The capital's male and female militia, equipped with light submachine guns, stood tall and saluted Prime Minister Abbas. Prime Minister Abbas enthusiastically waved to the militia frequently. At this time, the welcoming people held up the national flags of China and Algeria and shouted: "Salute to the heroic Algerian people!" "Long live the victory of the Algerian national liberation struggle!" "Long live the friendship between the Chinese and African people!"

Also present at the airport today to welcome the guests were responsible persons from various departments of our country's state organs, various democratic parties, various people's organizations, and Beijing Municipality, generals of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, and people from all walks of life in the capital.

Diplomatic envoys and diplomatic officials of various countries stationed in China, African foreign guests and students in Beijing, also came to the airport to welcome the guests today.

Xinhua News Agency, 29th: Premier Zhou Enlai held a grand banquet in the Great Hall of the People tonight to warmly welcome Prime Minister Ferhat Abbas and all the distinguished guests of the delegation of the Provisional Government of the Republic of Algeria led by him.

At 7:30, Prime Minister Ferhat Abbas and other distinguished Algerian guests, accompanied by Premier Zhou Enlai, entered the brightly lit banquet hall. At this time, a round of applause broke out in the hall, expressing a warm welcome to the representatives of the fighting Algerian people.

In his speech, Premier Zhou Enlai highly praised the struggle of the Algerian people. He said that the national liberation struggle waged by the Algerian people is an important development in the contemporary colonial revolutionary movement. Its significance and impact have far exceeded the scope of Algeria alone.

Premier Zhou Enlai said that the Algerian people's struggle is by no means isolated. The Chinese people have always deeply sympathized with and warmly supported the Algerian people's national liberation struggle. In order to support the Algerian people's national liberation struggle, we are willing to do everything we can. We have been, are, and will be like this.

Premier Zhou Enlai's remarks aroused stormy applause throughout the hall.

In his speech, Premier Zhou Enlai first expressed the warmest welcome and heartfelt thanks to Prime Minister Abbas for bringing precious fighting friendship. Premier Zhou Enlai emphasized that the great victory achieved by the Algerian people shows that the situation of the enemy being strong and us being weak is only temporary, and it will turn in the opposite direction. Because, although imperialism, which represents the forces of decay, appears to be strong, it is actually weak. He said that what is truly powerful and invincible is by no means decaying imperialism, but the awakened, united, and fighting Algerian people.

Premier Zhou Enlai also pointed out that the brilliant example of the Algerian people's persistent struggle and heroic fighting not only greatly encourages the people of Africa, Asia, and Latin America who are striving for national liberation, but also, because the Algerian people and the National Liberation Army have continuously depleted and contained the main force of the French colonial army, they have directly and powerfully supported the struggle of the people of the African continent against imperialism and for national independence, which is conducive to world peace.

Premier Zhou Enlai emphasized that the imperialist colonial system on the African continent is facing a comprehensive collapse and disintegration. It can be asserted that the struggle of the great African people for national independence is unstoppable by any force, and the day is not far off when they will once again become masters of their own land.

Premier Zhou Enlai's important remarks once again aroused warm applause throughout the hall. Many African friends present were particularly excited, and their applause lasted for a long time.

Premier Zhou Enlai then said that imperialism will never abandon its policies of aggression and war because of its difficult situation. In particular, US imperialism is trying to replace the old colonialists and put new colonial shackles on the heads of the African people. He said that Eisenhower's recent talk at the 15th UN General Assembly about establishing a so-called "United Nations system" in the Congo and Africa is essentially using the United Nations as a tool to realize the US imperialist grand conspiracy plan to replace the Lao colonialists and carry out comprehensive aggression and control of Africa.

Premier Zhou Enlai sternly condemned the fact that US imperialism has been supporting French imperialism in carrying out armed suppression and political conspiracies against the Algerian people, and supporting the colonial authorities of the Union of South Africa in implementing barbarous policies of racial discrimination. Recently, US imperialism has even used the United Nations to blatantly interfere in the internal affairs of the Congo, openly carrying out activities to split the Congo and subvert the legitimate government of the Congo. US imperialism is plotting to use Congolese to fight Congolese, and Africans to fight Africans, creating division in the Congo and Africa, in order to realize its ambition to swallow the Congo and the entire Africa. At the same time, US imperialism is also plotting to subvert and interfere in Laos in Asia, and to subvert and interfere in Cuba in Latin America. More and more facts have made it increasingly clear to the people of the world that US imperialism is the most dangerous enemy of the people of Africa, Asia, and Latin America, and the main enemy of the cause of world peace. The people of the world must unite and carry out a resolute struggle against US imperialism and its followers.

Premier Zhou Enlai said that the Chinese people love peace and have always advocated friendly cooperation with all countries on the basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. The Chinese people have always spared no effort to strengthen the unity of the socialist camp countries, strengthen the unity of the people of Asian, African, and Latin American countries, strengthen the unity of all peace-loving countries and people in the world, and wage persistent struggles to oppose the aggressive and war policies of US imperialism and defend world peace.

Finally, he firmly stated that Prime Minister Abbas and the Algerian people can believe that the Chinese people will always stand with the Algerian people, and the Chinese people will always be the most reliable friends of the Algerian people. The Algerian people will surely finally defeat imperialism and win their own independence and freedom.

In his speech, Prime Minister Ferhat Abbas said that they came to China as if they came to a fraternal family. He said that the warm welcome from the Chinese people is the most precious encouragement and the strongest support for the Algerian people.

Prime Minister Abbas praised the great victories achieved by the Chinese people, pointing out that the Algerian people, inspired by China's struggles and experiences, are convinced that colonialism will eventually be eliminated, and that the people who are subjected to colonial rule will eventually see the light of day and achieve a happier life and self-determination.

Speaking of the Algerian people's war of independence, Prime Minister Abbas said that the Algerian people's struggle has taken an active, direct, and revolutionary form, and this struggle has accelerated the process of decolonization and liberation of the African continent.

His remarks were warmly applauded throughout the hall.

Prime Minister Abbas spoke of the great sacrifices made by the Algerian people in the struggle, condemning the French colonialists for the crimes of causing innocent Algerians to die under torture in prisons and concentration camps.

Prime Minister Abbas strongly condemned the United States for helping the North Atlantic Treaty Organization countries to carry out wars of colonial conquest and for including Algeria within the scope of this treaty. He condemned that if the French war machine did not have the support of the entire North Atlantic Treaty Organization, and mainly the United States, in terms of weapons, finance, and equipment, it would have been defeated by the Algerian National Liberation Army as early as 1957.

When Abbas talked about the issue of the Algerian people's right to self-determination announced last year by French President General de Gaulle, he pointed out that de Gaulle was insincere and was clearly a trick to "paralyze" and deceive international public opinion. He accused that for a year, General de Gaulle has consistently refused to make guarantees for the implementation of self-determination, he has refused to discuss them, and even refused to negotiate the principles of these guarantees. While claiming to be in favor of peace and in favor of the Algerian people's self-determination, he continues to wage this cruel war.

Prime Minister Abbas stated that for the Algerian people, what is important is to lead to the true unity of free people, the independence of all countries, and the elimination of plunder and oppression from human society. Similarly, peaceful coexistence is incompatible with the division of territories, with maintaining the status quo, with reconciliation and compromise, and with spheres of influence that perpetuate certain forms of colonial enslavement.

Prime Minister Abbas concluded by saying that now is the time for active solidarity. The Algerian people will continue to fight, and the Algerian people appeal to the Chinese people in order to stop this war that attempts to exterminate the people who are striving for independence. Our appeal is not in vain.

Prime Minister Abbas's remarks were warmly applauded.

After the speeches by Premier Zhou Enlai and Prime Minister Abbas, the band played the solemn national anthems of the Republic of Algeria and the People's Republic of China respectively.

Members of the delegation of the Provisional Government of the Republic of Algeria: Minister of Interior Ben Tobbal Lakhdar, Director of the Prime Minister's Office Ben Yahia Mohamed, Director of Political Affairs of the Ministry of Information Boumendjel Ahmed, Director of Political Affairs of the Ministry of Interior Hahn Lamine and other distinguished guests attended the banquet.

Accompanying the guests at the banquet were Vice Premiers of the State Council He Long, Chen Yi, Nie Rongzhen, Xi Zhongxun, Vice Chairmen of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress Shen Junru, Guo Moruo, Huang Yanpei, Chen Shutong, Saifudin, Cheng Qian, Panchen Erdeni Qoigyi Gyaincain, Vice Chairman of the National Committee of the CPPCC Bao Erhan, Vice Chairmen of the National Defense Council Zhang Zhizhong, Fu Zuoyi, President of the Supreme People's Court Xie Juezai, and Procurator-General of the Supreme People's Procuratorate Zhang Dingcheng, and others.

Also present at the banquet were Vice Ministers of Foreign Affairs Zhang Hanfu and Ji Pengfei, President of the Chinese-African People's Friendship Association Liu Changsheng, Chairman of the Chinese Committee for Asian-African Solidarity Liao Chengzhi, responsible persons from various departments of our country's state organs, various people's organizations, various democratic parties, and Beijing Municipality, generals of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, and people from all walks of life in the capital.

Diplomatic envoys of various countries stationed in China, African foreign guests and students in Beijing, were invited to attend the banquet. During the banquet, artists from the capital performed song and dance programs to add to the enjoyment.

A reception was held before the banquet. Prime Minister Abbas met cordially with people from all walks of life in China at the reception.

Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 29th: Prime Minister Ferhat Abbas of the Provisional Government of the Republic of Algeria and the delegation of the Provisional Government led by him, who were invited to visit China and participate in the celebration of the 11th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, left here by "Tu-104" aircraft last night for Beijing.

      阿巴斯·费尔哈特总理是应周恩来总理的邀请，专程来我国进行友好访问的。今年5月间，中国人民曾经热烈欢迎了来访的阿尔及利亚共
  和国临时政府副总理贝勒卡塞姆，今天，阿巴斯总理再一次带来了战斗
  的阿尔及利亚人民的深厚友谊。当周恩来总理陪同贵宾乘敞篷汽车经过北京市区的时候，数十万夹道欢迎的工人、学生、解放军战士和全副武装的民兵们，挥舞旗帜，发出了震天动地的欢呼声，他们向英勇不屈地进行反对殖民主义斗争的阿尔及利亚人民，表示中国人民兄弟般的敬意和坚决的支持。
    周恩来总理在机场上讲话，代表中国政府和人民向阿巴斯·费尔哈特总理和全体阿尔及利亚贵宾表示了最热烈的欢迎之意。
    周恩来总理在讲到英雄的阿尔及利亚人民进行反对殖民主义的正义斗争的时候，强调指出：阿尔及利亚人民英勇不屈的革命精神，给非洲人民树立了光辉的榜样，并且赢得亚洲人民和世界人民的深切同情和坚决支持。
    周恩来总理说，阿尔及利亚人民的胜利，就是我们的胜利，也是全世界人民反对帝国主义和殖民主义的伟大胜利。中国政府和中国人民始终不渝地深切同情和完全支持你们的正义斗争，直到你们取得最后的彻底的胜利。他说，中、阿两国人民的亲密友谊，正在日益发展和巩固。总理阁下这次访问对进一步发展中阿两国的友谊必将作出新的贡献。
    阿巴斯·费尔哈特总理在讲话中热情地表达了阿尔及利亚人民对中国人民的深厚情谊。他说，中国人民无穷无尽的勇气和坚定不移的热情，为被奴役的人民树立了振奋人心的榜样，阿尔及利亚人民因为有中国人民这样的朋友而感到高兴。

    阿巴斯总理说，阿尔及利亚人民进行坚持不懈的斗争，在争取自身必将到来的解放的同时，也有效地支持了非洲大陆的解放，我们为此而感到自豪。他说，在反对法国殖民主义的顽强的斗争中，世界所有自由的人民都和我们站在一起，伟大的中国人民也和我们站在一起。
    今天，中华人民共和国和阿尔及利亚共和国两国的国旗在首都机场上空高高飘扬。机场建筑物上悬挂着巨幅欢迎的标语。下午四时二十分，飞机降落在首都机场上，阿巴斯·费尔哈特总理在一片热烈的掌声中，含笑走出机舱。这时周恩来总理首先走近机旁迎接，同周恩来总理一起上前迎接的，有国务院副总理贺龙、陈毅、聂荣臻、习仲勋，全国人民代表大会常务委员会副委员长郭沫若、赛福鼎、程潜、班禅额尔德尼·却吉坚赞、林枫，政协全国委员会副主席陈叔通、包尔汉，国防委员会副主席张治中、傅作义，最高人民法院院长谢觉哉，最高人民检察院检察长张鼎丞，外交部副部长章汉夫、姬鹏飞，中国人民解放军谭政大将，中国非洲人民友好协会会长刘长胜，中国亚非团结委员会主席廖承志等。他们同阿巴斯·费尔哈特总理等贵宾，一一亲切握手致意。
    军乐队奏阿尔及利亚共和国和中华人民共和国的国歌后，阿巴斯·费尔哈特总理由周恩来总理陪同，检阅了仪仗队。一群少年先锋队员跑上前去，带着欢迎的盛意把一束束的鲜花，献给阿巴斯·费尔哈特总理，献给阿尔及利亚共和国临时政府代表团成员：内政部长本·陶巴勒·阿赫达尔，总理办公室主任本·雅希亚·穆罕默德，宣传部政治事务主任布门杰勒·艾哈迈德，内政部政治事务主任哈恩·拉明等贵宾。

    今天到机场欢迎的，还有我国国家机关各部门、各民主党派、各人民团体和北京市的负责人，中国人民解放军的将军们，以及首都各方面的人士。
    各国驻中国的使节和外交官员，在北京的非洲外宾和留学生，今天也到机场欢迎。
    新华社29日讯　周恩来总理今晚在人民大会堂举行盛大宴会，热烈欢迎阿巴斯·费尔哈特总理和由他率领的阿尔及利亚共和国临时政府代表团全体贵宾。
    七时半，阿巴斯·费尔哈特总理等阿尔及利亚贵宾，由周恩来总理陪同进入灯光辉煌的宴会厅。这时，全场发出一片鼓掌声，向战斗的阿尔及利亚人民的代表们，表示热烈欢迎。
    周恩来总理在讲话中，高度地评价了阿尔及利亚人民的斗争，他说，阿尔及利亚人民所进行的民族解放斗争，是当代殖民地革命运动的一个重要发展。它的意义和影响，已经远远超越了阿尔及利亚一国的范围。
    周恩来总理说，阿尔及利亚人民的斗争决不是孤立的。中国人民一向深切地同情和热烈地支持阿尔及利亚人民的民族解放斗争。为了支持阿尔及利亚人民的民族解放斗争，我们愿意尽力做我们能做的一切。我们过去、现在和将来，都是这样。
    周恩来总理的这些讲话，激起了全场暴风雨般的掌声。
    周总理在讲话中，首先对带来珍贵的战斗友谊的阿巴斯总理阁下，表示了最热烈的欢迎和衷心的谢意。周总理强调说，阿尔及利亚人民所取得的伟大胜利表明，敌强我弱的形势只是暂时的，它将会朝着相反的方向转变。因为，代表腐朽势力的帝国主义虽貌似强大，而实际上是虚弱的。他说，真正有力量的和不可战胜的，绝不是腐朽的帝国主义，而是觉醒了的、团结起来的、战斗的阿尔及利亚人民。
    周总理还指出，阿尔及利亚人民坚持斗争、英勇奋战的光辉范例，不仅给予非洲、亚洲和拉丁美洲争取民族解放的各国人民以极大的鼓舞，而且由于阿尔及利亚人民和民族解放军使法国殖民军队的主力受到了不断的消耗和牵制，从而直接有力地支持了非洲大陆人民反对帝国主义和争取民族独立的斗争，有利于世界和平。
    周总理强调说，帝国主义在非洲大陆的殖民体系正面临着全面的崩溃和瓦解。可以断言，伟大的非洲人民争取民族独立的斗争，是任何力量所不能阻挡的，他们重新成为自己土地上的主人的日子已经不远了。
    周总理的这些重要的讲话，再一次激起了全场热烈的掌声。许多在场的非洲朋友们，表现特别兴奋，他们的掌声经久不息。
    周总理接着说，帝国主义决不会因为它们处境困难而放弃侵略政策和战争政策。特别是美帝国主义正在企图取老牌殖民主义者而代之，把新的殖民主义枷锁重新套在非洲人民的头上。他说，艾森豪威尔最近在十五届联大会上大谈其在刚果和非洲建立所谓“联合国制度”，它的实质就是利用联合国为工具，实现美帝国主义取代老挝殖民主义而进行全面侵略和控制非洲的大阴谋计划。
    周总理严厉地谴责说，美帝国主义一直在支持法帝国主义对阿尔及利亚人民进行武装镇压和政治阴谋，支持南非联邦殖民当局推行野蛮的种族歧视政策。最近，美帝国主义更利用联合国横蛮地干涉刚果的内政，公然进行分裂刚果和颠复刚果合法政府的活动。美帝国主义阴谋用刚果人打刚果人、用非洲人打非洲人，制造刚果和非洲的分裂，以实现其鲸吞刚果和整个非洲的野心。与此同时，美帝国主义还在亚洲策划对老挝的颠复和干涉，在拉丁美洲进行对古巴的颠复和干涉。越来越多的事实，使世界人民日益清楚地认识到，美帝国主义是非洲、亚洲和拉丁美洲人民的最危险的敌人，是世界和平事业的最主要敌人。世界人民必须团结起来，同美帝国主义及其追随者进行坚决的斗争。
    周总理说，中国人民热爱和平，一贯主张在和平共处五项原则的基础上同各国友好合作。中国人民始终不遗余力地为加强社会主义阵营各国的团结，加强亚、非和拉丁美洲各国人民的团结，加强世界一切爱好和平国家和人民的团结，为反对美帝国主义的侵略政策和战争政策，保卫世界和平而进行坚持不懈的努力。
    最后，他坚决表示，阿巴斯总理阁下和阿尔及利亚人民可以相信，中国人民将永远同阿尔及利亚人民站在一道，中国人民永远是阿尔及利亚人民最可靠的朋友。阿尔及利亚人民一定能够最后战胜帝国主义，赢得自己的独立和自由。
    阿巴斯·费尔哈特总理在讲话中说，他们来到中国就是来到了亲如兄弟的大家庭里。他说，中国人民对他们的热烈欢迎，是对阿尔及利亚人民的最宝贵的鼓舞、最为坚强有力的声援。
    阿巴斯总理盛赞中国人民所取得的伟大胜利，指出阿尔及利亚人民是在中国的战斗和经验的启发之下，确信殖民主义终将消灭，遭受殖民主义统治的人民终将重见天日，实现更为幸福的生活和自决。
    阿巴斯总理讲到阿尔及利亚人民的独立战争时说，阿尔及利亚人民的斗争采取了积极、直接和革命的形式，这个斗争加速了非洲大陆的非殖民地化和解放的进程。
    他的这些讲话，受到了全场热烈的掌声。
    阿巴斯总理讲到了阿尔及利亚人民在斗争中所作出的巨大牺牲，谴责法国殖民主义者使无辜的阿尔及利亚人死于监狱和集中营的酷刑之下的罪行。
    阿巴斯总理严词谴责美国帮助北大西洋公约组织国家进行殖民征服战争，并且把阿尔及利亚纳入这个公约的范围之内。他谴责说，如果法国的战争机器没有整个北大西洋公约组织以及主要是美国的武器、财政和装备方面的支援，它早在1957年就被阿尔及利亚民族解放军打垮了。
    阿巴斯在谈到法国总统戴高乐将军去年所宣布的阿尔及利亚人民享有自决权问题的时候，指出戴高乐是毫无诚意的，显然是一种用以“麻痹”和欺骗国际舆论的手法。他指责说，一年以来，戴高乐将军始终拒绝作出实行自决的保证，他拒绝加以讨论，甚至拒绝谈判这些保证的原则。而在声称赞成和平、赞成阿尔及利亚人民自决的同时，他却继续进行这场残酷的战争。
    阿巴斯总理表示，对于阿尔及利亚人民来说，重要的是导致自由人民的真正团结，各国人民的独立，并从人类社会中消除掠夺和压迫的勾当。同样，和平共处是同分割领土、同维持现状、同调和妥协、同使某种殖民奴役形式永久化的势力范围是不相容的。
    阿巴斯总理最后说，现在是积极团结的时刻了。阿尔及利亚人民将继续战斗下去，阿尔及利亚人民向中国人民发出呼吁，以便来制止这场企图灭绝争取独立的人民的战争。我们的这个呼吁不是徒然的。
    阿巴斯总理的这些讲话受到了热烈的鼓掌欢迎。
    周恩来总理和阿巴斯总理讲话之后，乐队分别奏庄严的阿尔及利亚共和国和中华人民共和国的国歌。
    阿尔及利亚共和国临时政府代表团成员：内政部长本·陶巴勒·阿赫达尔，总理办公室主任本·雅希亚·穆罕默德，宣传部政治事务主任布门杰勒·艾哈迈德，内政部政治事务主任哈恩·拉明等贵宾，出席了宴会。
