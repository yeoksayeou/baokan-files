Cadres, Old Farmers, and Technicians Combine to Systematically Summarize Weeding Experience
Tangyu Brigade Masters Laws and Weeds Cleverly, High Quality Field Management
Organize specialized teams according to technical plans, cadres participate in labor, technicians provide specific guidance, paddy fields are free of weeds

Fuzhou, September 1st (Our Newspaper) – Cadres, old farmers, and technicians of the Tangyu Brigade in Yingqian Commune, Changle, Fujian, have combined to comprehensively summarize weeding experience, formulate this year's high-standard weeding plan and operating procedures, and greatly improved weeding quality. At present, the team's 1,664 mu of late rice has completed the first weeding, and 22% has been weeded twice, generally achieving "three clears" on the ridges, in the fields, and at the field heads, and the late rice is growing well.

Timely Weeding is Better Than Fertilizing
After the summer planting was basically completed, the Tangyu Brigade launched a shock campaign to accumulate fertilizer, and applied refined fertilizer to every mu of land. On the basis of initially solving the fertilizer problem, the brigade's Party branch, based on the principle that various field management measures restrict each other, widely mobilized commune members to summarize past weeding experience in order to comprehensively improve the level of field management. "Timely weeding is better than topdressing," many commune members mentioned in their summaries, believing that grasping the timing of weeding is very important. What is considered "timely"? How many times should late rice generally be weeded? When is the best time to weed? - This became the first question for the commune members to discuss.

In the past, such agricultural proverbs were circulating here: "The Beginning of Autumn is the most timely" and "White Dew grass is good for next year," meaning that the first and last weeding should be done in the Beginning of Autumn and White Dew seasons. However, at the discussion meeting, young commune members pointed out: Last year, six mu of late rice in the "Guanyin Pavilion" area was transplanted four days after the "Great Heat." The commune members broke the old habits and weeded the first time twelve days after transplanting, combined with fertilization, promoting the rapid regreening of the rice. After that, they weeded every half month to twenty days, for a total of three times. On the other hand, three mu under the tombs were weeded nineteen days after transplanting according to the old almanac of "the Beginning of Autumn is the most timely." This not only required more labor but also affected the quality of weeding. These two plots of land had the same conditions and the same other measures, except for the different weeding times. As a result, the rice height differed by two inches and the yield differed by more than fifty catties. Based on this fact, the brigade technician Lin Dazhao further explained it from a scientific point of view. He said: In addition to avoiding weeds occupying space and fertilizer, the role of weeding also has three points, namely, loosening the soil, circulating air, and promoting fertilizer decomposition. Late rice has generally regreened about twelve days after transplanting and entered the tillering stage. At this time, it needs water, fertilizer, and sunlight the most. Timely weeding can promote the growth of new roots. After the tender grass is pressed into the soil and rotted, it is also a good fertilizer. If weeding is not timely, the growth force of the grass is stronger than that of the rice seedlings. As a result, the nutrients are absorbed by the weeds, and the rice seedlings naturally become thin and yellow. After discussion, the commune members unanimously agreed that the number of weeding times depends on the field, the seedlings, and the weeds, and there must be two sets of arrangements. One set is based on the general growth law of crops, weeding three times comprehensively: the first time in the early stage of tillering after regreening, the role is to promote tillering and ensure strong and vigorous seedlings; the second time around the "Beginning of Autumn" in the mid-tillering stage, the purpose is to increase effective tillering; the third time before the "White Dew" in the late tillering stage, the purpose is to ensure long ears and large grains. The second set of arrangements is based on the special circumstances of crop growth, adapting to local conditions and times, appropriately increasing the number of weeding times, and maintaining "three clears." The commune members summarized: "Grasp the timing to weed skillfully, and fertilizer comes from under your fingers."

Weeding Should Be "Three Seizes and Three Avoids"
Grasping the timing must also take into account other factors. During the summary, Lin Xiangguan, the captain of the second production team, raised such a question: He also knows the principle of weeding in a timely manner, but farm work is often not well arranged, which affects the season and quality of weeding. Like last year, Team 1 had 6.2 mu of paddy fields in the same place in Si Keng. The second weeding was done before the "Beginning of Autumn," taking advantage of the water in the fields to weed the grass. The more than three mu of rice fields of the neighboring Team 2 were only one day late, and because the field water was dried, they could not weed, and it was delayed until after the "White Dew" before weeding. As a result, the fields of Team 1 were flat and smooth, with a yield of more than 500 catties per mu; while the fields of Team 2 were almost covered by weeds, with nearly 140 catties less per mu. Therefore, he said: "It is certainly important to weed according to the seedlings, but if you don't pay attention to water source conditions, it won't work." Therefore, the discussion turned to the question of how weeding can be closely integrated with other farming measures. Commune members believe that the four factors of water, fertilizer, density, and soil directly affect weeding. They said: "The four links of water, fertilizer, density, and soil are like a chain, and they are tightly linked. If you don't look ahead and behind, and only focus on one link, it will become tighter and tighter, and more and more chaotic."

Based on the above experience, the commune members put forward the "Three Seizes and Three Avoids" weeding principle: Seize the opportunity to weed before and after fertilization. For four or five days after fertilization, the crops are absorbing fertilizer and growing roots, so strictly avoid weeding. Seize the opportunity to weed high fields, sandy fields, and water-deficient fields. Strictly avoid putting deep water on the fields for weeding and leaving the fields unweeded. Seize the opportunity to weed after regreening and before heading and ear emergence. Strictly avoid weeding before regreening and during heading and ear emergence. According to this principle, the commune members compiled a weeding rhyme: "Shallow water before and after fertilizer, rush to catch the tide and don't delay, look at the water to weed, the field soil is good, look at the fertilizer to weed, the sections grow longer."

Excellence Comes from Refinement
In the past, many commune members thought that weeding once was enough, but there is a lot of knowledge in this. The proverb "Those who know how to weed can weed one plant, those who don't know how to weed can weed a thousand plants" means this. At the discussion meeting, Li Enqian, an old farmer from the fifth team, talked about his experience: Before liberation, one year, he went to a neighboring village to help with short-term labor. When weeding, he pulled up the "field head egg" (a kind of weed) and stuffed it into the mud. Other farmers told him that the "field head egg" should be thrown out of the field. If it is stuffed into the soil, one plant will grow into two plants. Later, he did an experiment in his own field, and sure enough, this kind of grass was buried more and more, and it reproduced very quickly. At the meeting, he said with emotion: "I have been farming for decades, and I didn't understand the technique of weeding until recently. It's really true that you learn as you get older." What are the technical problems in weeding operations? First of all, it is necessary to clarify the special purpose to be achieved by each weeding, and secondly, to understand the different characteristics of various weeds. For example, after the rice seedlings regreen, there are many tender weeds in the field. When weeding, you should straighten your palm and use a "hand knife" to remove the tender weeds cleanly, requiring not missing a single weed. By the second and third weeding, the rice seedlings have grown up and the weeds are larger and older, so you have to use five fingers to grab deeply. At the same time, there are more than a dozen common weeds in the local fields: soil hair, duck beak pod, field head egg, duckling vegetable, sow ear, etc. Among them, duck beak pod and field head egg have extremely strong reproductive power and must be uprooted and taken out of the field for disposal. All other kinds of weeds only need to be deeply buried in the field.

No Weeds in Any Plot
After summarizing experience, the broad masses of commune members have strengthened their understanding of the importance of weeding, and cadres, old farmers, and technicians have further mastered the laws of weeding, greatly improving the level of field management. On this basis, the Party branch mobilized the masses to formulate a technical plan for weeding late rice this year, and adopted the following measures to ensure the realization of this plan: (1) Arrange labor and organize specialized teams. Of the 515 laborers in the team, 154 were drawn, accounting for 30%, and specialized weeding teams were organized according to the strength of the labor and technical expertise to ensure that one weeding is completed every eight days; (2) Take the production team as a unit, and the team leader and technician form an acceptance team to accept each plot and check and compare each time; (3) Implement the "three fixes" system of fixing people, fixing plots, and fixing points to ensure quality and quantity and promote each other; (4) Cadres go deep into the front line and work with commune members, old farmers, and technicians to study together, discuss at the field head, and constantly summarize experience, so that the weeding work efficiency and quality are generally improved. The new atmosphere of weeding in the whole brigade is: cadres arrange work in a timely manner, commune members operate skillfully, technicians provide specific guidance, and there are no weeds in any rice field.

    干部老农技术员三结合　系统总结耘草经验
    塘屿大队掌握规律巧锄草　田间管理质量高
    根据技术方案组织专业队，干部参加劳动，技术员具体指导，稻田无杂草
    本报福州1日电　福建长乐营前公社塘屿大队干部、老农、技术员三结合，全面总结耘草经验，订出今年高标准耘草计划和操作规程，大大提高了耘草质量。目前全队一千六百六十四亩晚稻，第一次耘草已经完成，耘过两次的达22％，普遍做到田塍、田里、田头“三光”，晚稻生长良好。
    及时耘草赛施肥
    塘屿大队在夏种基本结束后，曾开展一次积肥突击运动，每亩田都下了精肥。在初步解决了肥料问题的基础上，大队党支部又根据田间管理各项措施互相制约的道理，广泛发动社员，总结往年耘草经验，以全面提高田间管理水平。“及时耘草赛追肥”，许多社员在总结中都提到这句农谚，他们都认为掌握耘草时机十分重要。怎样才算是“及时”了呢？晚稻一般要耘几次？什么时候耘最好？——这就成为社员们讨论的第一个问题。
    过去这里流传着这样的农谚：“处暑时，最及时”、“白露草，明年好”，意思是说耘草头一遍和最后一遍在处暑和白露两个季节。但是，在座谈会上，青年社员们提出：去年“观音亭”地方六亩晚稻，“大暑”后四天插秧，社员们打破老习惯，在插下十二天就耘第一次草，结合施肥，促使稻子迅速返青，以后每隔半个月至二十天又耘一次，前后共耘了三次；另外墓下三亩由于根据“处暑时、最及时”的老皇历，插下十九天才耘草，不但花工多，还影响到耘草质量，这两丘田条件相同，其他措施相同，就是耘草时间不一样，结果稻子高矮相差两寸，产量相差五十多斤。根据这个事实，大队技术员林大兆又从科学道理上作了解释。他说：耘草的作用除了避免杂草占用空间和肥料外，还有三条，即疏松土壤、流通空气、促进肥料分解。晚稻插下十二天左右即已返青，进入分蘖阶段，这时最需水、肥、阳光，及时耘草，能够促使新根生长，嫩草压在土里腐熟后，又是好肥料；如果耘草不及时，草的生长力比禾苗强，结果养分都被野草吸收去了，禾苗自然瘦小萎黄。经过讨论，社员们一致认为：耘草次数看田、看苗、看草而定，必须有两套安排，一套是根据作物一般生长规律，全面耘草三次：第一遍在返青后分蘖前期，作用是促进分蘖保证苗壮苗旺；第二遍在“处暑”前后分蘖中期，目的是增加有效分蘖；第三遍在白露前分蘖末期，目的是保证穗长粒大。第二套安排是根据作物生长的特殊情况，因地因时制宜，适当增加耘草次数，保持“三光”。社员们总结说：“掌握时机巧耘草，手指底下出肥料”。
    耘田要“三抢三忌”
    掌握时机还得照顾到其他各种因素。在总结的时候，第二生产队长林祥官提出这样一个问题：适时耘草的道理他也知道，但农活往往排不好，影响到耘草的季节和质量。像去年一队在四坑同地方有六亩二分山田，第二遍锄草在“处暑”前，趁田里有水就耘了草；而邻近二队的三亩多稻田只晚了一天，就因田水晒干，耘不动了，一直拖到“白露”后才耘草，结果一队的田又平又光，每亩收成五百多斤；而二队的田几乎被荒草掩没了，每亩少收近一百四十斤。因此他说：“看苗耘草固然重要，如果不注意水源条件也不行。”因此讨论就转到耘草如何与其他耕作措施紧密结合的问题。社员们认为，水、肥、密、土四个因素，都直接影响到耘草。他们说：“水、肥、密、土四个环节和耘草之间就像连环套一样环环套紧，如果不瞻前顾后，单抓一环，就会越搞越紧，越抓越乱。”
    根据上述经验，社员们提出了“三抢三忌”的耘草原则：施肥前和施肥后要抢先耘草，施肥后四、五天作物正在吸肥长根，严忌耘草；高田、沙田、缺水田要抢先耘草，严忌放深水耘草和搁田耘草；返青以后和孕穗抽穗以前要抢先耘草，返青前孕穗抽穗期中严忌耘草。根据这样的原则，社员们编了一个耘草歌诀：“肥前肥后浅浅水，赶潮抢火莫挨延，看水耘田田土好，看肥耘草节节长。”
    精中出巧
    过去许多社员认为耘过一遍就算一遍，其实这里边大有学问。农谚“会薅薅一蔸，不会薅薅千蔸”就是这个意思。座谈会上，第五队的老农李恩钱谈了自己的体会：解放前有一年，他到邻村帮短工，耘草时把“田头蛋”（野草名）拔起塞在泥中，别的农民告诉他，“田头蛋”要丢到田外去，塞在土里，一株会生两株。后来他在自己田里作了试验，果然这种草越埋越多，繁殖很快。在会上，他感慨地说：“我种田几十年，直到最近才懂得耘草的技术，真是做到老学到老。”耘草的操作究竟有哪些技术问题？这首先要明确每一次耘草所要达到的特殊目的，其次要了解各种野草的不同特性。譬如禾苗返青以后，田里草多而嫩，耘草时就要伸直手掌，用“手刀”把嫩草铲除干净，要求不漏过一株杂草。到二、三遍耘草时，禾苗已经长大，杂草较大较老，就要用五指深抓。同时，当地田中常见的杂草有：土毛、鸭嘴荚、田头蛋、鸭仔菜、猪母耳等十多种，其中鸭嘴荚和田头蛋两种繁殖力极强，必须连根拔起，带到田外处理，其余各种杂草只须深埋田中就行。
    丘丘无杂草
    经过总结经验，广大社员加强了对耘草重要性的认识，干部、老农、技术员进一步掌握了耘草的规律，大大提高了田间管理水平。在这基础上，党支部发动群众制订了今年晚稻耘草技术方案，并采取以下几项措施，保证这个方案的实现：（一）安排劳力，组织专业队，在全队五百十五个劳力中，抽出一百五十四人，占30％，根据劳力强弱，技术特长，组织耘草专业队，保证每八天完成一遍耘草；（二）以生产队为单位，由队长、技术员组成验收小组，丘丘验收，次次检查评比。（三）实行定人、定丘、定分“三定”制度，保质保量，互相促进。（四）干部深入第一线，和社员、老农、技术员共同研究，田头讨论，不断总结经验，使耘草工效和质量普遍提高。全大队耘草的新气象是：干部排工及时，社员操作熟练，技术员指导具体，丘丘稻田无草。
