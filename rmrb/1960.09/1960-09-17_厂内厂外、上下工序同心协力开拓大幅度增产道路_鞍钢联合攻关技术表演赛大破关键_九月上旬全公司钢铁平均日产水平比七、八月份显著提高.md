Xinhua News Agency, Anshan, September 16th: The hundreds of thousands of workers at Anshan Iron and Steel (An'gang) have launched a vigorous joint problem-solving technical performance competition, promoting a steady rise in production. In early September, the average daily production level of steel and iron for the entire company increased significantly compared to July and August.

The joint problem-solving technical performance competition developed from technical performance competitions within a factory, a work process, or a work team. The characteristic of this competition is that factories engage in large-scale unity, large-scale collaboration, large-scale support, and large-scale performance between factories, between upper and lower processes within a factory, and between workers of the same type, concentrating superior forces to solve key production problems that are not easily solved by one department alone, paving the way for a substantial leap forward in steel production.

In order to ensure a substantial leap forward for various steel mills, the Anshan Iron and Steel Ironmaking Plant needed a greater number of slag pots and molten iron ladles to transport the molten iron produced by the blast furnaces to the steel mills in a timely manner. The factory Party committee believed that to solve this key problem effectively, it was necessary for factories inside and outside, upper and lower work processes, and different types of work to closely cooperate and work together to accelerate the turnover rate of molten iron ladles and slag pots. Therefore, they launched a joint problem-solving technical performance competition with the Transportation Department and various steel mills, working together to tackle the key to accelerating the turnover of slag pots and molten iron ladles. The steel mill workers quickly loaded the delivered molten iron into the mixers, greatly reducing the accumulation of slag pots and molten iron ladles. They also carefully cleaned the remaining slag and iron from the bottom of the molten iron ladles to avoid solidification and the formation of hard caps when loading molten iron next time. The Transportation Department and the Ironmaking Plant formed a unified command to tackle the key issues of scheduling and transportation, cleaned up more than seventy iron block cars, ensured that trains entered and exited directly in groups, and accelerated the turnover rate of slag pots and molten iron ladles. Workers in various sections of the Ironmaking Plant, such as blast furnaces and iron casting, also launched competitions around this central task, tackling key issues such as blast furnace front operation, repairing large ladles, turning slag pots, scheduling transportation, and allocating materials in a precise manner. Thanks to the coordinated efforts of all parties, the turnover rate of slag pots and molten iron ladles has significantly increased, meeting the needs of blast furnaces for producing more iron per cycle.

Currently, from the ore mines that produce raw materials to the various steel rolling mills, from the main production departments to the various auxiliary sections, from all factories and mines of the company to every furnace and machine, workers in every link have投入 themselves in the joint problem-solving technical performance competition. Workers on the transportation front launched a large-scale collaborative competition with workers in production factories and mines to improve the traction capacity of locomotives. Drivers and switchmen at the Central Station of the Transportation Department made a guarantee to the workers of the First Steel Mill: no matter how much steel the steel mill produces, they will guarantee timely transportation. Steel workers also guarantee that they will clear obstacles on both sides of the railway line at any time, so that trains transporting steel ingots or slag pots can run smoothly and increase the traction of locomotives. Workers at the East Anshan Mine adopted the method of joint problem-solving technical performance competition to tackle the key issue of the perforation machine's efficiency not keeping up with the needs of mining and loading, rapidly increasing the perforation efficiency by more than 20%.

During the joint problem-solving performance competition, the company Party committee secretary, manager, and leading cadres of the Party committees of various factories went deep into the forefront of production, to weak links to offer ideas and find solutions together with the workers, and effectively solve specific problems one by one. The slag pot and molten iron ladle transportation problem of the Ironmaking Plant involved a wide range of issues. The company Party committee secretary, manager, as well as the Party committee secretaries of the Ironmaking Plant and the Transportation Department, personally went into action, studied the issues with the workers, formulated concrete and effective measures, and helped establish a unified management system for scheduling slag pots and molten iron ladles. The output of steel at the First Steel Mill increased rapidly, and large ladles could not meet the needs of open-hearth furnaces. Factory Party committee secretary Sheng Ping went deep into the ingot casting section, formed a "three-way combination" team with workshop workers, and launched a one-stop problem-solving technical performance competition centered on large ladles and molds, rapidly accelerating the turnover of large ladles and meeting the needs of open-hearth furnaces.

### 厂内厂外、上下工序同心协力开拓大幅度增产道路  鞍钢联合攻关技术表演赛大破关键  九月上旬全公司钢铁平均日产水平比七、八月份显著提高

    厂内厂外、上下工序同心协力开拓大幅度增产道路
    鞍钢联合攻关技术表演赛大破关键
    九月上旬全公司钢铁平均日产水平比七、八月份显著提高
    据新华社鞍山16日电　鞍钢十几万职工掀起轰轰烈烈的联合攻关技术表演竞赛热潮，推动生产稳步上升。9月上旬，全公司的钢、铁平均日产水平都比7、8月份有了显著提高。
    联合攻关技术表演竞赛，是在一个厂、一个工序、一个班组的技术表演竞赛的基础上发展起来的。这种竞赛的特点是，各厂与厂之间，一个厂上下工序之间，同工种之间，展开上下左右的大联合、大协作、大支援、大表演，集中优势力量，扎扎实实地解决一个部门不易单独解决的生产关键问题，为钢铁生产大幅度跃进铺平道路。
    鞍钢炼铁厂为了保证各钢厂大幅度跃进，需要更多数量的渣罐和铁水罐，以便把高炉炼出的铁水及时送到炼钢厂。厂党委认为要很好地解决这一关键问题，必须厂内厂外、上下工序、工种之间紧密配合，共同努力加快铁水罐和渣罐的周转速度。于是，他们同运输部和各炼钢厂开展了大联合、大协作、大支援的攻关技术表演赛，同心协力围攻加快渣罐和铁水罐周转的关键。各炼钢厂职工把送来的铁水迅速地装入混铁炉，使积压渣罐和铁水罐的现象大大减少，并且仔细地把铁水罐底上剩下的残渣、残铁清理干净，避免下次装铁水时造成铁水凝结硬盖。运输部和炼铁厂组成统一指挥部，围攻调度和运输的关键，清理好七十多辆铁块车，做到成组的列车直进直出，加快了渣罐和铁水罐的周转速度。炼铁厂高炉、铸铁等各工段职工，也以此为中心，相继展开竞赛，围攻高炉炉前操作，修大罐，翻渣罐，调度运输，以及整点配块等关键。由于各方面的协同努力，目前渣罐和铁水罐的周转速度已经显著加快，满足了高炉多出一次铁的需要。
    现在，从生产原料的矿山到各轧钢厂，从主要生产部门到各辅助工段，从公司各厂矿一直到每座炉子和机台，各个环节的职工都已投入联合攻关技术表演竞赛热潮。运输战线上的职工为了提高机车牵引能力，同生产厂矿职工展开了大协作竞赛。运输部中部站的司机和调车员们向第一炼钢厂职工提出了保证：钢厂生产多少钢，他们都保证及时运走。炼钢工人也保证随时把线路两旁的障碍清理干净，让运钢锭或渣罐的列车畅通无阻，提高机车牵引力。东鞍山矿职工采用联合攻关技术表演赛的办法，围攻穿孔机效率跟不上采矿和装车需要的关键，使穿孔效率迅速提高了20％以上。
    在联合攻关表演赛当中，公司党委书记、经理和各厂党委领导干部，都深入生产第一线，到薄弱环节去同工人一道出主意想办法，切切实实地解决了一个一个的具体问题。炼铁厂的渣罐和铁水罐运输问题，牵扯面很广，公司党委书记、经理以及炼铁厂和运输部的党委书记，都亲自出马，同工人一道研究，订出具体有效的措施，并且帮助建立了统一调度渣罐和铁水罐的管理制度。第一炼钢厂钢的产量增长很快，大罐不能满足平炉的需要。厂党委书记盛平深入铸锭工段，跟车间职工共同组成一个“三结合”小组，展开了以大罐、模子为中心的一条龙攻关技术表演赛，使大罐周转迅速加快，满足了平炉的需要。
