Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, September 2nd: The Central Committee of the Japanese Communist Party today issued a statement demanding the cancellation of the Japanese government's planned talks in Seoul with the South Korean puppet clique, and the immediate and unconditional extension of the agreement on repatriating Korean residents in Japan to the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.

The statement said: "South Korea is under the occupation of American imperialism, and many nuclear bases have been established there. Japan is also in a state of semi-occupation by the American military. In this situation, what does the friendship between Japan and the 'Republic of Korea' mean?"

The statement pointed out that Kosaka's visit to South Korea and the subsequent visit of a South Korean delegation to Japan were preparations for the establishment of a Northeast Asia Treaty Organization.

The statement expressed support for Premier Kim Il Sung's proposal for holding democratic and free elections in Korea to unify Korea.

When discussing the issue of repatriating Korean residents in Japan, the statement demanded the unconditional extension of the repatriation agreement. The statement accused the government of imposing undue pressure on the news reporting activities of Korean journalists.
