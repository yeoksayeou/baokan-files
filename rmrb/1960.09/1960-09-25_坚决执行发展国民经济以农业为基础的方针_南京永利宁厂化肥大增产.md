Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, September 24th: Nanjing Chemical Company's Yongli Ning Factory, one of China's large-scale chemical plants, has achieved a greater leap forward in production this year due to its firm implementation of the Party's policy of basing national economic development on agriculture. On the eve of National Day, the factory reported another victory: ammonium hydroxide production in early September had already exceeded the annual plan by 6%, 1 quarter and 20 days ahead of schedule, an increase of 176.7% compared to the same period last year. The large quantities of ammonium hydroxide, ammonium sulfate, ammonium bicarbonate, and other fertilizers produced all meet the quality specifications required by the state and are now being shipped to rural areas across the country. Some new products that began mass production this year have been welcomed by the vast rural areas.

　　At the beginning of this year, when arranging production tasks, the Yongli Ning Factory first prioritized the production of ammonia for fertilizer to ensure the rapid development of agriculture, placing it in the most important position. The development of agriculture has placed higher demands on the quantity, variety, and effectiveness of fertilizers, which has resulted in a mismatch between the factory's equipment and production requirements. For example, the original production method of ammonium hydroxide was outdated, the process was relatively complicated, and the equipment capacity was limited, making it difficult to meet production requirements. To address this situation, all workshops and departments throughout the factory closely focused on the central goal of increasing fertilizer production and better serving agriculture, launched extensive technical innovation and technical revolution movements, and finally discovered a set of production laws that were more, faster, better, and more economical. For example, they adopted a new process for producing ammonium hydroxide, which immediately tripled the daily production level. Young technicians in the comprehensive utilization section of the synthetic ammonia workshop made many innovations on the carbonization tower, increasing the daily output of ammonium bicarbonate by five to six times. To produce more synthetic ammonia, the factory added major mechanical equipment such as gas furnaces, compressors, and synthetic ammonia equipment this year. Through mass technical innovation and technical revolution movements, the factory's degree of mechanization has rapidly increased, and labor productivity has increased by 2.3 times compared to the same period last year, achieving both increased production and labor savings.

　　The Yongli Ning Factory not only greatly increased fertilizer production to serve agriculture but also became a base for manufacturing equipment for small and medium-sized fertilizer factories in Jiangsu Province and a school for training technical personnel for fertilizer production throughout the province. Since the beginning of this year, the Yongli Ning Factory has provided complete sets of equipment for three fertilizer factories in Liuhe, Danyang, and Jiangning counties. This year, factories from forty-seven counties and people's communes have sent people to the Yongli Ning Factory to learn production techniques. In addition, the Yongli Ning Factory has also sent management cadres, technicians, and skilled workers to Jiangpu, Jiangning, and Liuhe counties nearby, as well as the Nanjing and Pukou suburbs and the Nantong, Yangzhou, and Yancheng special districts, to help these places develop fertilizer production. All these activities have played a positive role in accelerating the technical transformation of local agriculture.

　　Since the beginning of this year, under the leadership of the factory's Party committee, the idea of basing national economic development on agriculture has taken deep root in the minds of the broad masses of workers and staff, thus greatly enhancing their awareness and enthusiasm for supporting agriculture. In the first half of this year, the factory supplied the surrounding ten communes with dozens of kinds of equipment and materials, such as electric motors, water pumps, and rice transplanters, and established fixed cooperative relations with the nearby Changlu and Longshan People's Communes. Through support and cooperation, the workers have established deep feelings with the peasants, mutually regarding each other's difficulties as their own and trying their best to solve them. Since the second half of this year, the factory-commune partnership has seen new development. At the end of July, the factory, led by the deputy director, took a group of technicians and workers to the Longshan Commune to eat, live, work, and discuss with the peasants, conducted a detailed investigation and study of the commune's agricultural technical transformation situation and problems, and jointly formulated a three-year development plan for the commune and a further support plan with the commune's Party committee.

### 坚决执行发展国民经济以农业为基础的方针　南京永利宁厂化肥大增产

　　坚决执行发展国民经济以农业为基础的方针
　　南京永利宁厂化肥大增产
    据新华社南京24日电　我国大型化学工厂之一——南京化学公司永利宁厂，今  年以来，由于坚决执行党的发展国民经济以农业为基础的方针，生产取得比去年更大的跃进。国庆节前夕，这个厂又传出胜利捷报：氨水产量在9月上旬已经提前一个季度零二十天超额6％完成了全年计划，比去年同期增长176.7％。生产出的大量氨水、硫酸氨、碳酸氢氨等化肥，都符合国家规定的质量规格要求，现已源源运往全国各地农村。今年开始大量生产的一些新产品，受到了广大农村的欢迎。
    今年年初，永利宁厂在安排生产任务的时候，首先从多产化肥以保证农业的迅速发展出发，把生产化肥用氨排在第一位。农业的发展，对化肥数量、品种和肥效都提出了更高的要求，这样就产生了企业设备和生产要求不相适应的情况。如氨水，就因原有生产方法陈旧，工序比较复杂，设备能力有限，很难满足生产要求。针对这种情况，全厂各车间、各部门紧紧围绕增产化肥、更好地为农业服务这个中心目标，大搞技术革新和技术革命，终于摸索到一套多快好省的生产规律。如他们采用生产氨水的新工艺，一下子就把日产水平提高了三倍左右。合成氨车间综合利用工段的青年技术员，在碳化塔上作了多次革新，使碳酸氢铵的日产量提高了五倍到六倍。为了多产合成氨，今年厂里又增加了煤气炉、压缩机和合成氨设备等主要机械设备。经过群众性的技术革新和技术革命运动，全厂机械化程度迅速提高，劳动生产率比去年同期提高二点三倍，做到了增产又省人。
    永利宁厂不仅大量增产化肥为农业服务，而且成了江苏省中小型化肥工厂设备制造的基地，成了为全省培养化肥生产技术人材的学校。今年以来，永利宁厂已经为六合、丹阳、江宁三县提供了三座化肥工厂的全套设备。今年还有四十七个县的和人民公社的工厂派人在永利宁厂学习生产技术。此外，永利宁厂还派出管理干部、技术人员和技术工人分赴附近江浦、江宁、六合三县，南京、浦口郊区和南通、扬州、盐城三个专区，帮助这些地方发展化肥生产。所有这些活动，都为加速当地农业的技术改造起了良好的作用。
    今年以来，在工厂党委的领导下，发展国民经济以农业为基础的思想已经在全厂广大职工群众中深深地扎下了根子，因而大大提高了支援农业的自觉性和积极性。今年上半年，这个厂就供给周围十个公社电动机、水泵、插秧机等数十种设备和材料，并且同附近的长芦、龙山人民公社建立了固定的协作关系。通过支援和协作，工人们都同农民建立了深厚的感情，互相把对方的困难看成是自己的困难，想尽办法去解决。今年下半年以来，厂社之间的挂钩协作关系又有了新的发展。7月底，工厂以副厂长为首带领了一批技术人员和工人，到龙山公社去与农民同吃、同住、同劳动、同商量，对公社的农业技术改造的情况和问题进行了详细的调查研究，并同公社党委共同制定了公社三年发展规划和进一步支援的计划。
