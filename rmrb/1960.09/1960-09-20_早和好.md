    Autumn planting must be done not only at the right time but also with high quality. All members of the people's communes should have the ambition to strive for more wheat, rapeseed, peas, broad beans, etc., next summer than in any previous year. To achieve this goal, we must do all the specific work in autumn planting better than in any previous year, reaching higher standards.
    What are the standards for good planting? Mainly: planting on deeply ploughed land, planting on moisture-retaining land, planting on land with sufficient base fertilizer, using carefully selected seeds with a high germination rate and treated seeds, using tools suitable for close planting, sowing evenly, and with high efficiency, sowing neither too deep nor too shallow, neither too late nor too early. Each item must be done better than in previous years. If each specific problem can be solved conscientiously and practically, we can ensure the overall victory.
    We must plant early, but not too early (lest the crops grow too vigorously before winter, which is detrimental to overwintering); for varieties with similar "characteristics" in each region, the most suitable time for sowing is only a few days. The main crop should be planted in a timely manner, and the replanting should be done as early as possible. Planting quickly and well presents difficulties and contradictions. We should not avoid difficulties and contradictions, but face them squarely and overcome and solve them separately.
    There are two main ways to achieve both early and good planting: from the entire process of autumn planting, everything that can be done in advance should be done well in advance; from the various tasks of autumn planting, all forces that can be concentrated should be concentrated for a blitz. Ploughing, land preparation, irrigation, drainage, manure delivery, manure spreading, seed selection, seed drying, tool repair, etc., can all be done in advance. Once the time for sowing arrives, all the work that can be done early has been done, and the largest advantage forces can be concentrated to blitz the sowing, planting everything well in the few days most suitable for sowing. Some of the work that can be done in advance can also be appropriately concentrated for a blitz, focusing on attacking one "fortress" at a time.
    If the local sowing time is approaching and the various preparations have not been completed, the contradiction between early and good planting becomes more acute and prominent. In this case, what should be done? We should grasp the most important aspects and see which aspect has the greatest impact on yield. If we only focus on quality and disregard time, for example, delaying sowing for a season, the reduced yield may often not be compensated for by improving the quality of sowing. If we can do a better job in all aspects related to the quality of sowing by delaying it slightly for three or two days, and can compensate for the loss of slightly later sowing with a surplus, it may be worthwhile to delay it slightly. This still needs to be looked at item by item. If the base fertilizer is not sufficient, top dressing can be applied; although top dressing is not as good as applying sufficient base fertilizer, it can still remedy part of the problem. The adverse consequences of sowing without prepared seeds are even more difficult to remedy. Therefore, if there is a contradiction between preparing base fertilizer and timely sowing, the fertilizer aspect can be appropriately conceded; if there is a contradiction between preparing seeds and preparing fertilizer, we should concentrate our efforts on preparing seeds; if there is a contradiction between preparing seeds and timely sowing, the sowing time will have to be postponed slightly, and then other measures will be used to remedy the situation.
    The relationship between early and good planting is like this: the earlier the preparation work starts, the better the quality of sowing will be, and they can promote each other; if we don't grasp it tightly and the time is delayed, the greater the contradiction between them; if we concentrate our efforts and handle it appropriately, we can reduce the contradiction between them. Starting early and preparing early is the best strategy; taking into account all factors and handling them flexibly when contradictions arise is the middle strategy; focusing on one aspect only and acting mechanically when contradictions arise is the worst strategy. The worst strategy must be avoided. If the forces are well deployed and the work is well arranged, the middle strategy may achieve the same effect as the best strategy. In any case, we must muster our energy and strive for the upstream.

### 早和好

    早和好
    秋种，既要种得时间恰好，又要种得质量很高。个个人民公社的社员们都要有这样的雄心大志：争取明年夏天拿到手的麦子、油菜籽、豌豆、蚕豆等等比以往任何一年都多。要达到这个目标，先要在秋种的时候把各种具体工作都做得比以往任何一年好，达到更高的标准。
    种好的标准是什么？主要是：种在深耕的土地上，种在保墒的土地上，种在施足底肥的土地上，用的是经过精选的、发芽率高的、作了处理的种子，用的是适于密植的、播种均匀的、效率较高的工具，播得既不深也不浅，既不迟也不早。每一项都要做得胜过往年。一个一个的具体问题，都能认真地切实地解决，就能确保全局的胜利。
    要早种，又不可种得过早（以免冬前长得太旺，反而不利于过冬）；每个地区的“性格”近似的品种，播种的最适宜时间只有短短几天。正茬要种得及时，回茬要力求早种，既要种得快，又要种得好，这里是有困难的、是有矛盾的。不应该回避困难和矛盾，而要正视它们，并分别加以克服和解决。
    做到既早又好的主要门路有两条：从秋种的全部过程来说，要把一切能够提前做的事情提前做好；从秋种的各项工作来说，要用一切能够集中的力量集中突击。耕地、整地、灌溉、排水、送粪、撒粪、选种、晒种、检修工具，等等，都是可以提前做的。能够早做的事情都做好了，播种的时机一到，就可以集中最大的优势力量突击播种，在最适宜播种的几天时间全部种好。能够提前做的那些工作，有些也可以适当集中力量突击，一次着重攻打一个“堡垒”。
    如果当地的播种时间已经迫近，而各项准备工作还没有做好，早和好的矛盾就更尖锐更突出了。在这情况下，怎么办？应该抓住最主要的方面，要看哪个方面对产量的影响最大。如果只看到质量而不顾时间，例如迟延一个节令播种，可能减少的产量往往是提高播种质量所不能补偿的。如果稍迟三两天而能把有关播种质量的各项工作做得更好，能够补偿稍迟播种的损失而有余，当然也不妨稍迟。这还要一项一项来看。底肥不十分充足，还可以追肥；追肥虽然不如施足底肥好，但是总还能补救一部分。种子没有准备好就播种，造成的不良后果就更难补救了。因此，如果准备底肥同及时播种发生了矛盾，肥料方面可以适当让步；如果准备种子同准备肥料发生了矛盾，就应该集中力量准备种子；如果准备种子同及时播种发生了矛盾，播种时间就只好稍为推迟，然后用别的措施补救。
    早和好的关系就是这样的：准备工作动手越早，播种质量也就越好，它们之间可以互相促进；抓得不紧，时间越迟，它们之间的矛盾越大；力量集中，处理得适当，又可以把它们之间的矛盾化小。早动手，早准备，是上策；发生矛盾的时候统筹兼顾、灵活处理，是中策；发生矛盾的时候只顾一面、机械行事，是下策。下策是必须避免的。力量调度得好，工作安排得好，中策有可能得到上策同样的效果。在任何情况下都要鼓足干劲，力争上游。
