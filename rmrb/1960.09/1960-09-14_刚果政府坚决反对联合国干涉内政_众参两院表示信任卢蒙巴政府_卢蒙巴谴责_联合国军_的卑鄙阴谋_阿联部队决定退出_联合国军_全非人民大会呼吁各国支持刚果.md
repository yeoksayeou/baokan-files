Xinhua News Agency, Leopoldville, September 12th: Congolese Speaker of the House Kasongo and Senate President Joseph Okito sent telegrams to the President of the Security Council and the UN Secretary-General, protesting the UN authorities' interference in the Congo's internal affairs.

The telegrams stated, "The Congolese House of Representatives and Senate discussed the Head of State's order of September 5, 1960, to dismiss the Lumumba government. After lengthy debate and final voting, both houses decided to express their complete confidence in the Lumumba government and to repeal the Head of State's order of September 5, 1960. As the supreme authority of the country, the decisions made by the parliament are unchangeable."

The telegrams stated, "Parliament learned today that a delegation, supposedly representing a government not recognized by parliament, has departed for New York. The Security Council must not receive this completely illegal delegation, nor can this delegation speak for the Congo."

The telegrams stated, "The (Congolese) Parliament is outraged by the UN Secretary-General's interference in the Congo's internal affairs. We firmly hope that the member states of the Security Council will do everything in their power, within its authority, to spare the Congo from new disasters. We firmly request that you deal only with the sole legitimate government, which has appealed to the United Nations to restore law and order in the Congo."

It is reported that a delegation representing the illegal Iléo "government" has successfully transferred by plane from Brazzaville, the former capital of French Congo, to New York. However, when the delegation of the legitimate Congolese government, headed by Thomas Kanza, transferred by plane in Brazzaville on the 11th to go to the United Nations, they were obstructed by a team of police officers commanded by French police officers.

Xinhua News Agency, Leopoldville, September 12th: As the United States manipulates the United Nations to intensify interference in the internal affairs of the Republic of the Congo, the situation here is becoming increasingly tense.

Yesterday, when Lumumba went to the radio station to speak, the "UN forces" pointed guns at him, preventing him from entering the station.

At the same time, the United Nations is once again engaging in conspiracies, using Ghanaian soldiers commanded by British officers, who are part of the "UN forces", to deal with their Congolese brothers. Under UN instructions, Ghanaian soldiers were forced to use guns to prevent Congolese soldiers, demanding the return of their property, from entering the radio station.

It is believed here that the United Nations is engaged in a conspiracy to make "Congolese fight Congolese, Africans fight Africans" in order to undermine African unity and pave the way for military occupation of the Congo.

In addition, under the planning of the United Nations, a small group of people actually arrested Prime Minister Lumumba today. However, Lumumba was soon released by troops supporting the Congolese government and received enthusiastic cheers from the masses.

Lumumba told the crowd who welcomed him that he had been illegally arrested, that he was still the Prime Minister of the Congo, and that the conspiracy against him had failed. Later, he told reporters that "the United Nations is responsible for all of this."

After Lumumba's arrest, Congolese Deputy Prime Minister Gizenga immediately sent a telegram to the UN Security Council, condemning the UN's conspiracy against Prime Minister Lumumba.

The blatant interference in the Congo's internal affairs and opposition to the legitimate government of the Congo by the United Nations, manipulated by the United States, has been severely condemned by Congolese public opinion and nationalist parties. In an article in the Congolese People's Party's organ, "Liberation" Weekly, published on the 11th, it asked: "By what right does the United Nations occupy our national radio station? By what right does the United Nations support Kasavubu, making him confront the legitimate government?"

The article pointed out: "Imperialists are hiding behind the UN forces. Spies are hiding behind the UN forces and UN documents."

The article stated that all Congolese nationalists will support the legitimate Lumumba government and the Congolese National Army to the end.

The African Solidarity Party, one of the ruling parties in the Congo, recently passed a resolution firmly expressing its support for the Lumumba government, and pointed out that "the vote of confidence in the (Congolese) Parliament confirms the power of this government." The resolution called on the Congolese people, all political parties and organizations to "do everything possible to oppose actions that would undermine our national sovereignty, unity and territorial integrity."

The youth organization of the African Solidarity Party also issued a statement saying: "Kasavubu cannot arbitrarily use his position to place the sovereign Republic of the Congo under the disguised rule of any foreign country—even the United Nations."

Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, September 12th: UAR Deputy Undersecretary of State for Presidential Affairs, Abdel Kader Hatem, announced tonight that the UAR has decided to withdraw its parachute battalion from the "UN forces" in the Congo.

Hatem said that the development of the situation in the Congo shows that the "UN Headquarters" there had ordered its troops to occupy radio stations and airports and to prohibit the Congolese government from using them, and therefore the "UN forces" had exceeded the tasks entrusted to them.

Hatem pointed out that the UAR believes that this act blatantly violates the sovereignty of the Congo, seriously threatens the independence and territorial integrity of the Congo, and provides an opportunity for imperialist countries to realize their conspiracy to split the Congo and undermine its independence.

Hatem finally said that the Congolese government is the only authority that has the right to manage its own territory, radio stations and airports, so the UAR government has decided to immediately withdraw its parachute battalion in the Congo under the command of the United Nations.

Xinhua News Agency, September 13th: Accra News: All-African People's Conference Secretary-General Diallo Abdoulaye issued a statement on the 12th, calling on the heads of independent African countries that have placed troops at the disposal of the United Nations to take steps to ensure that African troops stationed in the Congo are not used to serve imperialism.

Speaking at a press conference in Accra, the capital of Ghana, Diallo Abdoulaye said that "African troops were sent to the Congo to help the Congolese people, not to suppress the Congolese government." Due to the "UN forces'" illegal actions in the Congo, he called on African heads of state to consider the position of their troops serving in the "UN forces."

He also announced that the Permanent Secretariat of the All-African People's Conference called on African countries to demand that the United Nations return all airports in the Congo and the Leopoldville radio station to the Congolese government.

It is reported that due to the United Nations' blatant interference in the Congo's internal affairs, the Guinean military commander stationed in the Congo has decided to withdraw his troops from the "UN forces." The United Arab Republic also decided on the 12th to withdraw its troops from the "UN forces."

    刚果政府坚决反对联合国干涉内政
    众参两院表示信任卢蒙巴政府　卢蒙巴谴责“联合国军”的卑鄙阴谋
    阿联部队决定退出“联合国军”　全非人民大会呼吁各国支持刚果
    新华社利奥波德维尔12日电　刚果众议院议长卡松戈和参议院议长约瑟夫·奥基托曾经打电报给安全理事会主席和联合国秘书长，抗议联合国当局干涉刚果内政。
    电报说，“刚果众议院和参议院讨论了1960年9月5日国家元首解散卢蒙巴政府的命令。在经过长时间的辩论之后最后表决决定，众参两院都分别表示完全信任卢蒙巴政府，废除国家元首1960年9月5日的命令。作为国家的最高权力机构，议会所作出的决定是不能改变的。”
    电报说，“议会今天得悉，有一个所谓代表着没有得到议会承认的政府的代表团已动身前往纽约。安全理事会不能接待这个完全非法的代表团，这个代表团也不能代表刚果讲话。”
    电报说，“（刚果）议会对联合国秘书长干涉刚果内政感到愤慨。我们坚决希望，安全理事会的会员国将在它的权力范围内尽一切力量，使刚果免受新的灾难。我们坚决请求你们只同唯一的合法政府打交道，这个政府为了恢复刚果的法制和秩序已经向联合国发出呼吁。”
    据悉，一个代表伊利奥非法“政府”的代表团已经从前法属刚果首都布拉柴维尔顺利地转乘飞机去纽约。但是当以托马斯·坎扎为首的刚果合法政府的代表团11日在布拉柴维尔改乘飞机前往联合国时，曾受到法国警官指挥的一队警察的阻挠。
    新华社利奥波德维尔12日电　由于美国操纵联合国加剧干涉刚果共和国内政，这里的局势日益趋于紧张。
    昨天，当卢蒙巴去电台讲话时，“联合国军”曾用枪对着他，不准他进入电台。
    同时，联合国今天再次玩弄阴谋诡计，使参加“联合国军”的由英国籍军官指挥的加纳士兵去对付他们的刚果兄弟。在联合国指令下，加纳士兵被迫用枪来阻止要求收回自己的财产的刚果士兵进入电台。
    这里据信，联合国正在玩弄使“刚果人打刚果人、非洲人打非洲人”的阴谋，以便破坏非洲的团结，并为对刚果进行军事占领铺平道路。
    另外，在联合国策划下，有一小撮人今天居然逮捕了卢蒙巴总理。但是不久，卢蒙巴就被支持刚果政府的军队释放了，并受到群众的热烈欢呼。
    卢蒙巴向欢迎他的人群说，他是被非法逮捕的，他仍是刚果的总理，反对他的阴谋没有能得逞。后来，他向记者指责说，“联合国要对这一切负责”。
    在卢蒙巴被捕之后，刚果副总理基赞加立即打电报给联合国安全理事会，谴责联合国反对卢蒙巴总理的阴谋。
    美国操纵的联合国明目张胆干涉刚果内政、反对刚果合法政府的行为，受到刚果舆论和民族主义政党的严厉谴责。11日出版的刚果人民党机关刊物“解放”周刊在一篇文章中质问道：“联合国凭什么权利霸占我们的国家电台？联合国凭什么权利支持卡萨武布，使他同合法政府对抗？”
    文章指出：“帝国主义者隐藏在联合国部队的背后。间谍们隐藏在联合国部队和联合国证件的背后。”
    文章表示，一切刚果民族主义者，将拥护卢蒙巴合法政府和刚果国民军到底。
    刚果执政党之一的非洲团结党最近通过决议，坚决表示支持卢蒙巴政府，并且指出，“（刚果）议会的信任票确认了这个政府的权力”。决议号召刚果人民、所有政党和团体“竭尽全力反对足以损害我们的民族主权、统一和领土完整的行动”。
    非洲团结党的青年组织也发表声明说：“卡萨武布无论如何不能擅自利用自己的职位来把刚果的主权共和国置于任何一个外国——即使是联合国——的变相统治之下”。
    新华社开罗12日电　阿联负责总统事务副国务部长阿卜杜勒·卡德尔·哈特姆今天晚上宣布，阿联决定撤出它在刚果的“联合国军”中的一个伞兵营。
    哈特姆说，刚果的事态发展表明，那里的“联合国总部”曾命令它的军队占据电台和机场，并禁止刚果政府使用它们，因此“联合国军”已经超越了委托给他们的任务。
    哈特姆指出，阿联认为，这一行为明目张胆地侵犯了刚果的主权，严重地威胁了刚果的独立和领土完整，并为帝国主义国家实现它们分裂刚果和破坏刚果独立的阴谋提供了机会。
    哈特姆最后说，刚果政府是唯一有权管理它自己的领土、电台和机场的当局，因此阿联政府决定立即撤出它在刚果的在联合国统辖下的这个伞兵营。
    新华社13日讯　阿克拉消息：全非人民大会秘书长迪亚洛·阿卜杜拉12日发表声明，呼吁那些把军队交给联合国支配的非洲独立国家的首脑采取步骤，以保证驻在刚果的非洲军队不被用来为帝国主义服务。
    迪亚洛·阿卜杜拉在加纳首都阿克拉举行的记者招待会上说，“派非洲军队到刚果去是为了帮助刚果人民，而不是去镇压刚果政府的”。由于“联合国军”在刚果的非法行动，他要求非洲国家元首考虑他们在“联合国军”中服役的军队的立场。
    他还宣布，全非人民大会常设秘书处呼吁非洲各国要求联合国把刚果所有的机场和利奥波德维尔电台归还刚果政府。
    据报道，由于联合国粗暴地干涉刚果内政，联合国驻刚果的几内亚军司令已决定把他的军队从“联合国军”中撤出来。阿拉伯联合共和国也在12日决定把它的军队撤出“联合国军”。
