Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, September 17th: More than 80,000 cadres from leadership organs above the county level in Shandong Province have left their offices and gone deep into the front lines of production, with the majority heading to the agricultural production front. In the previous period, various levels of leadership organs in Shandong Province had already sent a large number of cadres to work or engage in labor training at the grassroots level. After the launch of the production increase and economy campaign centered on grain and steel, the cadres in the organs believed that the current season is a crucial period for determining the year's production, especially the "Three Autumns" work on the agricultural front, which is related to the overall production situation for two years. Therefore, they enthusiastically applied to go to the grassroots level, to the countryside, and to the most difficult places to work. More than 6,000 cadres from provincial-level administrative organs and enterprise and institutional management organizations have gone to the front lines of production.

More than half of the department heads, bureau chiefs, and section-level leading cadres of the provincial Party and government leadership organs have gone deep into the front lines of production. In Liaocheng, Linyi, Heze, Changwei and other special districts and county organs, about 75% of the cadres have been sent down to strengthen the front lines of production. In many counties and cities such as Laiyang, Zhaoyuan, and Feicheng, 80% of the cadres have been sent down to production teams to serve as leaders, canteen administrators, and feeders.

The cadres sent to the countryside carried forward the fine traditions of hard work and plain living and dedicated hard work, adhering to the principles of eating, living, working, and discussing matters with the masses. They first went to the poorer and more backward teams with greater difficulties, worked hard, and led the masses to do a good job in the "Three Autumns" work. In Liaocheng, Linyi, and Changwei, more than 14,000 cadres went to work in poor and backward teams. The masses of Xuzhuang Production Team of Nanguantao People's Commune in Guanxian County were greatly encouraged to see that the seven cadres sent down were down-to-earth in participating in and leading production. Some commune members, who had previously lacked understanding of the importance of developing agricultural production, also expressed their determination to do a good job in agricultural production in their village. Under the influence of the cadres sent down, cadres of communes and production teams almost all went to production sub-teams or work groups to work, labor, and study. In Linyi area, more than 10,000 cadres above the sub-team level went to work groups to strengthen the leadership of the work groups. Through the joint efforts of the cadres sent down, the original cadres, and the commune members, some units that were originally backward in production have made great progress in a short period of time.

Xinhua News Agency, Nanchang, September 15th: After 30,000 cadres in Jiangxi Province went deep into the front lines of agricultural production, they ate, lived, worked, and discussed matters with the masses. Through investigation and research, they meticulously solved key problems in production, which vigorously promoted the current autumn field management work.

The cadres who went deep into the front lines of production generally settled down in the most difficult places and in areas with weak work, helping basic-level cadres solve key problems in production. Yu Jinwen, deputy secretary of the Ji'an Prefectural Party Committee, after going deep into the mountainous area of ​​Lianhua County, found through investigation that some sub-teams had not tightened the management of late rice in remote fields on mountain pits. He immediately discussed with the sub-team cadres and commune members and proposed ways to quickly break through this weak link. The method of improving the management of mountain pit remote fields was promoted to the whole district, and the whole special district immediately set off a new upsurge of vigorously grasping mountain pit remote fields for fertilizer application and topdressing. After the cadres of the Suichuan County Party Committee went deep into the grassroots to understand the use of labor, they rationally arranged labor throughout the county, which added more than 20,000 laborers to the agricultural production front line.

After a large number of cadres settled in poor and backward teams, they adopted the method of setting up red flags and establishing pacesetters to encourage commune members to set high ambitions and lofty aspirations to quickly change the backward situation. The Qiaotou Brigade of Lianhua County used to be a backward unit. After Liu Fengbin, deputy secretary of the County Party Committee, came to this brigade, he helped the commune members carry out a red flag competition movement of "learning from the advanced, catching up with the advanced, surpassing the advanced, and helping the backward," which greatly improved the progress and quality of autumn field management. The late rice was generally cultivated three times and topdressed three times, and sweet potatoes and soybeans were hoeed and topdressed. Through evaluation, six red flag groups and twenty-four individual pacesetters emerged in the entire brigade, removing the label of backwardness.

    帮助基层干部解决生产中的关键问题
    山东江西大批干部深入生产第一线
    据新华社济南17日电　山东省县以上领导机关先后有八万多名干部走出办公室，深入生产第一线，其中大多数干部奔赴农业生产第一线。山东省各级领导机关在前一个时期，已经有大批干部深入到基层工作或劳动锻炼。以粮、钢为中心的增产节约运动开展以后，机关干部们认为目前季节是决定全年生产的关键时期，特别是农业战线上的三秋工作，关系着两年的生产大局，因此热烈申请到基层去，到农村去，到最艰苦的地方去工作。省级行政机关和企业、事业管理机构先后有六千多名干部走上生产第一线。
    省党政领导机关的部长、厅局长和科长级领导骨干中，有一半以上深入到生产第一线。聊城、临沂、菏泽、昌潍等专区、县机关，有75％左右的干部下放加强生产第一线。莱阳、招远、肥城等许多县、市机关80％的干部已下放到生产队担任领导工作、食堂管理员、饲养员等职务。
    下放到农村的干部，发扬艰苦朴素和埋头苦干的优良传统，坚持与群众同吃同住同劳动同商量。他们首先到困难较大的穷队、后进队去，艰苦奋斗，带动群众搞好三秋工作。聊城、临沂、昌潍三个专区就有一万四千多名干部到穷队、后进队工作。冠县南馆陶人民公社许庄生产队群众看到下放的七名干部脚踏实地地参加生产领导生产，受到很大鼓舞，有些原来对发展农业生产的重要性认识不足的社员，也表示决心要把本村的农业生产搞好。在下放干部的影响下，各地公社和生产队干部几乎全部都深入到生产小队或作业组去劳动、工作和学习。临沂地区有一万多名小队以上干部到作业组去加强了作业组的领导工作。在下放干部、原有干部和社员的共同努力下，一些原来生产落后的单位，在短期内有了很大进步。
    据新华社南昌15日电　江西省三万干部先后深入农业生产第一线后，与群众同吃、同住、同劳动、同商量，经过调查研究，认真细致地解决生产中的关键问题，有力地推动了当前秋田管理工作。
    深入生产第一线的干部，普遍到最艰苦的地方、到工作薄弱的地区安家落户，帮助基层干部解决生产中的关键问题。吉安地委副书记于锦文深入莲花县山区后，经过调查，发现有的小队对山坑远田的晚稻没有抓紧管理，他立即和小队干部、社员商量，提出迅速突破这一薄弱环节的办法，改进了山坑远田的管理，并把这里的经验向全区推广，全专区立即掀起了一个大抓山坑远田送肥、追肥的新高潮。遂川县委的干部深入基层了解劳动力的使用情况后，在全县范围内合理安排了劳动力，使农业生产第一线增加了两万多个劳动力。
    大批干部到穷队、后进队落户以后，采取树红旗、立标兵的办法，鼓励社员们树雄心、立大志，迅速改变后进面貌。莲花县桥头大队过去是后进单位，县委副书记刘奉斌到这个大队后，帮助社员们开展了“学先进、赶先进、超先进、帮后进”的红旗竞赛运动，使秋田管理进度和质量大大提高，晚稻普遍进行了三耘三追肥，红薯、大豆都锄了草、追了肥，通过评比，全大队出现了六个红旗组，二十四个个人标兵，摘掉了后进帽子。（附图片）
