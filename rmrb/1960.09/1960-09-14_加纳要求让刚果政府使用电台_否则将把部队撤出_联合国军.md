Xinhua News Agency, Accra, September 13th: Ghanaian President Nkrumah wrote to UN Secretary-General Hammarskjöld today, stating that if the United Nations does not allow the Congolese government to use its own radio station, Ghana will withdraw its troops in the Congo from the "UN Forces."

In his letter, Nkrumah said that Ghana originally sent troops to the Congo to assist the legitimate Lumumba government, but "because the Ghanaian troops are now almost exclusively used by the (UN) forces as tools to obstruct Lumumba from using his own radio station," Ghana's position has been undermined.

Nkrumah also pointed out that the Brazzaville radio station controlled by France and the Elisabethville radio station controlled by Belgium are frantically conducting anti-Lumumba propaganda. He said: "Thus, while a member of the Security Council (referring to France) is allowed to attack Lumumba, Ghana is actually being used to tie Lumumba's hands behind his back."

Nkrumah said, "Under the current circumstances, if (the UN) does not allow Lumumba to use his own radio station in Leopoldville to tell the Congolese people about the dangerous situation and mobilize them to support the legitimate government of the Republic of the Congo led by him, then Ghana will withdraw its troops from the command of the United Nations and reserve the right to hand over its troops entirely to the Republic of the Congo (for use) at the suggestion of the legitimate Lumumba government of the Republic of the Congo."

It is reported that Ghana has sent more than 2,400 troops to the Congo, commanded by British officers. The United Nations "Headquarters" in the Congo had repeatedly driven this force on the 11th and 12th to prevent Lumumba from entering the Leopoldville radio station to deliver a speech.

The "UN Headquarters'" conspiracy of "Africans fighting Africans" has been unanimously condemned by the Congolese people and world public opinion.

    加纳要求让刚果政府使用电台
    否则将把部队撤出“联合国军”
    新华社13日讯　阿克拉消息：加纳总统恩克鲁玛今天写信给联合国秘书长哈马舍尔德说，如果联合国再不让刚果政府使用它自己的电台，加纳将把它在刚果的军队撤出“联合国军”。
    恩克鲁玛在信中说，加纳原来派军队去刚果是为了援助卢蒙巴合法政府的，但是，“由于加纳军队现在几乎专门被（“联合国军”）用来作为它阻挠卢蒙巴使用他自己电台的爪牙”，加纳的地位已经遭到破坏。
    恩克鲁玛还指出，法国控制的布拉柴维尔电台和比利时控制的伊利沙伯维尔电台正在疯狂地进行反对卢蒙巴的宣传。他说：“这样，与安全理事会的一个成员国（按指法国）被允许打击卢蒙巴的同时，加纳实际上被用来在后面束缚卢蒙巴的双手。”
    恩克鲁玛说，“在目前情况下，假如（联合国）不准许卢蒙巴利用他自己在利奥波德维尔的电台，把危险的局势告诉刚果人民，并动员他们支持由他领导的刚果共和国合法政府，那末，加纳将把它的军队从联合国的指挥下撤出来，并保留在刚果共和国卢蒙巴合法政府的建议下、把它的军队完全交给刚果共和国（使用）的权利。”
    据报道，加纳派往刚果的军队有二千四百多人，受英国籍军官指挥。联合国驻刚果“总部”曾在11日、12日接连驱使这支军队阻挠卢蒙巴进入利奥波德维尔电台发表演说。
    “联合国总部”这种“以非洲人打非洲人”的阴谋，遭到刚果人民和世界舆论的一致谴责。
