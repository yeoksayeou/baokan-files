(From Our Tianjin Dispatch, September 23rd) The Yang Desheng group of the Second Branch of the Tianjin Second Steel Plant, due to in-depth political and ideological work, has summarized and promoted a set of advanced experiences in steelmaking operations. Since the beginning of this year, they have not produced a single heat of defective steel, creating an outstanding record of 988 consecutive heats without scrap steel from January to September 23rd. They have become a red banner of high quality, high production, low consumption, and accident-free comprehensive leap forward on Tianjin's steel front.

      Ideological Work First
    The Yang Desheng converter steelmaking group has a total of eleven workers. Except for the group leader (furnace chief) Yang Desheng, who is a veteran worker with more than ten years of experience, the rest are all new workers. In 1958, Yang Desheng was still an open-hearth assistant. He had learned converter steelmaking technology from the steelmaking hero Qiu Cai Kang. Qiu Cai Kang's heroic act of rescuing molten steel at the risk of his life left a deep impression on Yang Desheng. After returning to the Tianjin Second Steel Plant as a converter furnace chief, under the leadership of the Party, based on the idea that "when people are red, steel is even redder," he often conducted political and ideological education for all workers in the group through various forms such as political study meetings, ideological debate meetings, and newspaper reading meetings. This enabled the group workers to clearly understand the importance of producing more and better steel for accelerating national economic development and supporting agricultural technology transformation. They established the idea of taking the plant as their home, steelmaking as their career, and steelmaking workers as their pride, and everyone was full of energy. He often cared about the ideological problems existing in the group and, together with the trade union group leader and the Communist Youth League group leader, adopted the "three guarantees" method of guaranteeing thought, guaranteeing work, and guaranteeing study to help the workers improve their ideological and technical levels. When worker Zhu Runtian was just transferred from the warehouse, he was not settled in his work. Group leader Yang Desheng specifically helped him to improve his class consciousness and steelmaking technology. He quickly settled down and became an activist in the group. He took the lead in searching for scrap manganese iron, silicon iron, aluminum blocks, etc., both on and off the furnace platform and inside and outside the furnace pit. Moreover, he searched carefully and picked up a lot, and was rated as a pacesetter for cherishing national property in the group. When the campaign for increasing production and practicing economy began in August, in order to create even more outstanding achievements in the remaining months of this year, this group decided to promote the advanced steelmaking experience of single-slag operation, which has a short melting time, saves slag materials, and has high desulfurization efficiency. However, a few people in the group did not know much about single-slag operation and were afraid of producing defective products during the promotion. The leaders of the group explained to the workers the important role of single-slag operation in rapid steelmaking and saving auxiliary materials, and organized everyone to study the technical operation of single-slag steelmaking, thereby unifying understanding ideologically and making full preparations in terms of technical operation. In late August, four heats of single-slag operation steelmaking were tested in a row, and all heats were successful. Now, this experience has been fully promoted, and the blowing time of each heat of steel has been shortened by about ten minutes, saving 15% of slag materials such as fluorite and lime.

    Adhere to "Collective Steelmaking"
    The workers in this group have a high ideological awareness, and everyone cares about the production of the entire group. Based on this idea, after more than half a year of production practice, they have summarized a set of working methods for group "collective steelmaking." This is a mass line working method.

    The specific method is: after taking over the shift every day, before refining each heat of steel, first hold a pre-furnace meeting to study the main production conditions of this heat of steel, such as the sulfur content, temperature, furnace lining, and furnace age of the molten iron, determine countermeasures, and clarify tasks and division of labor. Before tapping, all group members gather in front of the furnace to observe the boiling of the molten steel, the furnace temperature, the flame, and the slagging, and each puts forward opinions for everyone to evaluate. During the evaluation, regardless of the furnace chief, assistant, or ordinary worker, they fully express their opinions on whether the steel should be tapped, whether the air volume needs to be increased, or whether the temperature needs to be increased, and finally the furnace chief makes a summary. Through "collective steelmaking," the strength and wisdom of the collective can be fully utilized, collective wisdom can be gathered, production technology can be studied, and problems in production can be solved in a timely manner. Once, before tapping, all the workers in the group gathered in front of the furnace to observe and found that the temperature in the furnace suddenly dropped. The molten steel could not boil, so they quickly checked the cause. It turned out that there was a crack in the air duct behind the furnace, and a large amount of hot air was escaping. Yang Desheng immediately discussed with everyone. At that time, there were two opinions: one opinion was to stop the air and wait for the maintenance workers to repair the air duct. In this way, this heat of steel would be scrapped due to the drop in furnace temperature. The other opinion was not to stop the air, but to block the crack in the air duct and take back this heat of steel. The group leader adopted the latter opinion, and as a result, this heat of steel was refined into high-quality steel. "Collective steelmaking" has also further strengthened the sense of responsibility and mutual cooperation among all the workers in the group, and at the same time, it has accelerated the improvement of the technical level of all the workers in the group. Now, all ten new workers have reached the level of the second assistant, and the second assistant Han Guide can independently refine steel. In late July, Yang Desheng did not go to work for half a month due to illness, but the whole group insisted on the method of "collective steelmaking," and without the command of the furnace chief, there was not a single heat of defective steel.

    The Yang Desheng group not only cooperated well within the group, but also established a "one-dragon" cooperation relationship with the ironmaking furnace and steel casting workshop. Before pouring molten iron, Yang Desheng often went to the ironmaking furnace to understand the temperature and sulfur content of the molten iron, and sometimes helped the ironmaking furnace workers add desulfurizers, skim slag, and tap molten iron. The workers of the Wang Liubu ironmaking group also actively improved the post responsibility system, improved the internal and external desulfurization methods of the furnace, and ensured the timely supply of molten iron, and increased the desulfurization efficiency by 20% to 30%, creating favorable conditions for the Yang Desheng group to produce no defective products. Yang Desheng also often followed the molten steel to the steel casting workshop after tapping, introducing the temperature and capacity of the molten steel to the steel casting workshop, so that the steel casting workers would have a clear understanding in order to improve the ingot qualification rate.

              Constantly Learning and Summarizing Advanced Experience
    Because the workers in the Yang Desheng group have established the idea of taking steel as their career and steelmaking workers as their pride, everyone is actively studying technology, constantly learning and creating advanced experience, and rapidly improving their operating skills. First of all, they studied and analyzed the advanced experience learned by group leader Yang Desheng from Shanghai, Tangshan, Tianjin Third Steel Plant, and the advanced group of this plant - Wang Wenhua group, combined with the advanced experience created by this group, and summarized the "small slag volume slagging" and "strict, guarantee, early, prevent" (strictly control the amount of molten iron charged into the furnace, maintain full surface blowing, early slagging to increase temperature, prevent poor degassing) four steelmaking measures, and quickly and comprehensively promoted them. The use of the "small slag volume slagging" method shortens the slagging time from 20 minutes for large slag volume slagging to about 10 minutes, increases the desulfurization efficiency by 50%, and correspondingly shortens the blowing time of each heat of steel by about one-third, and also saves 30% to 50% of slag materials; the use of the "strict, guarantee, early, prevent" four measures for steelmaking greatly prolongs the furnace age, and increases the qualified rate of steel ingots from the original 97%-98% to more than 99.6%, and in August, it won the first place in all aspects of the plant's output, quality, furnace age, reduced consumption, safety, and cooperation.

    Since the launch of the campaign to increase production and practice economy, the Yang Desheng group has launched a new upsurge of labor competition. In the competition between groups, in addition to carrying out paired competitions with the Tianjin special model group - the Wang Wenhua group of the First Branch of Tianjin Second Steel Plant, and humbly learning from the Wang Wenhua group's experience in taking the mass line and their communist style, they also signed a paired competition contract with the Gao Wencai group, which operates on the same furnace platform in the same shift, to help the Gao Wencai group improve its technology and make progress together. The group launched a "five-good" opponent competition of good ideology, good production, good completion of job duties, good safety, and good cooperation within the group. Now, ten members of the group have won the title of five-good group members. The Yang Desheng group has also been rated as the "five-good" group of the entire plant. (Attached picture)

In order to accurately grasp the composition of each heat of steel and eliminate defective products, in addition to relying on the laboratory to test samples, they also take samples themselves for pre-furnace collective analysis.

    政治工作深入人人风格高积极钻研技术个个本领好
　　杨德生小组连续九百多炉无废钢
　　八月份夺得全厂产量、质量、炉龄、消耗、安全、协作等六个方面的第一名
    本报天津23日电　天津第二钢厂二分厂杨德生小组由于政治思想工作深入，在炼钢操作方面总结和推行了一套先进经验，今年以来没有出过一炉废品，从1月到9月23日创造了连续九百八十八炉无废钢的优异成绩，成为天津市钢铁战线上优质、高产、低消耗、无事故全面跃进的一面红旗。
      思想工作先行
    杨德生转炉炼钢小组共有十一名工人，除组长（炉长）杨德生是有十多年工龄的老工人外，其余都是新工人。杨德生1958年还是一个平炉助手，他曾向炼钢英雄丘财康学习过转炉炼钢技术。丘财康那种奋不顾身抢救钢水的英雄行为，给杨德生留下了深刻的印象。他回到天钢二厂担任转炉炉长以后，在党的领导下，本着“人红钢更红”的思想，经常通过政治学习会、思想辩论会、读报会等各种形式，对全组工人进行政治思想教育，使小组工人清楚地认识到多炼钢、炼好钢，对加速国民经济发展，支援农业技术改造的重要意义，树立了以厂为家、以炼钢为业、以炼钢工人为荣的思想，大家都干劲十足。他经常关心组内存在的思想问题，并且和工会小组长、共青团组长一起采取包思想、包工作、包学习的“三包干”方法，帮助工人们提高思想水平和技术水平。工人朱润田刚由仓库调来时，工作不够安心，组长杨德生就具体帮助他提高阶级觉悟和炼钢技术，他很快就安心工作了，并成为组内的积极分子。他带头在炉台上下和炉坑内外，搜拣废锰铁、矽铁、铝块等，而且搜得仔细，拣得多，被评为组内爱护国家财产的标兵。8月间增产节约运动开始时，这个组为了在今年后几个月创造更出色的成绩，决定推广熔炼时间短、节省渣料，脱硫效率高的单渣操作的先进炼钢经验。但是组内少数人对单渣操作不太了解，怕在推广时出废品，小组的领导人员就分别对工人讲解单渣操作对快速炼钢、节约副料等的重要作用，组织大家学习单渣炼钢的技术操作，从而在思想上统一了认识，在技术操作方面作了充分的准备。8月下旬一连试验了四炉单渣操作炼钢，炉炉都试验成功了。现在，这一经验已全面推广，每炉钢的吹炼时间缩短十分钟左右，节约萤石、白灰等渣料15％。
    坚持“集体炼钢”
    这个小组的工人思想觉悟高，人人都关心全组生产。在这一思想基础上，他们经过半年多的生产实践，总结出了一套小组“集体炼钢”的工作方法。这是一条群众路线的工作方法。
    具体作法是：在每天接班后，炼每炉钢以前，先开一个炉前会，研究一下这炉钢的铁水含硫量、温度、炉衬、炉龄等主要生产条件，决定对策，明确任务和分工。在出钢以前，全组人员集中在炉前，观察钢水的沸腾、炉温、火焰、化渣等情况，各提意见，大家评议。评议时，不分炉长、助手和普通工人，对该不该出钢、是否还需加大风量、提高温度等都充分发表意见，最后由炉长作总结。通过“集体炼钢”，能够充分发挥集体的力量和智慧，集思广益，研究生产技术，及时解决生产中的问题。有一次，在出钢前，全组工人集中在炉前观察，发现炉内温度突然降低。钢水沸腾不起来，就迅速检查原因，原来是炉后的风管道裂了一个口子，大量热风跑掉了。杨德生立即和大家商量。当时有两种意见：一种意见是，停风等保全工人来修理风管道。这样，这炉钢便会因炉温降低而报废。另一种意见是不停风，堵住风管道裂口，夺回这炉钢。组长采纳了后一种意见，结果这炉钢炼成了优质钢。“集体炼钢”还使全组工人进一步加强了责任心和相互之间的协作，同时更快地提高了全组工人的技术水平。现在，十名新工人已经全部达到二助手的水平，二助手韩贵德已能独立炼钢。7月下旬，杨德生因病半个月没有上班，但是全组坚持“集体炼钢”的办法，在没有炉长指挥的情况下，也没有出一炉废品。
    杨德生小组不仅组内协作得很好，而且同化铁炉、铸钢工段建立了“一条龙”协作关系。杨德生在兑铁水以前，经常到化铁炉前了解铁水的温度、含硫率等情况，有时还帮助化铁炉工人加脱硫剂，扒渣，出铁水。王留卜化铁小组的工人也积极健全了岗位责任制，改进了炉内、炉外脱硫方法，保证了铁水及时供应，并使脱硫效率提高20％到30％，为杨德生小组不出废品创造了有利条件。杨德生还常在出钢后随钢水到铸钢工段，把钢水的温度和容量介绍给铸钢工段，使铸钢工人心中有数，以便提高钢锭合格率。
              不断学习和总结先进经验
    杨德生小组的工人由于确立了以钢为业、以炼钢工人为荣的思想，大家都积极钻研技术，不断学习和创造先进经验，迅速提高了操作技术水平。首先，他们将组长杨德生从上海、唐山等地和天津第三钢厂以及本厂先进小组——王文华小组学来的先进经验，结合本小组创造的先进经验，进行研究分析，总结出了“小渣量造渣”和“严、保、早、防”
  （严格控制铁水装炉量、保持全程面吹、早化渣提高温度、防止脱气不良）四项炼钢措施，并迅速全面推广。采用“小渣量造渣”法，造渣时间由大渣量造渣的二十分钟，缩短到十分钟左右，脱硫效率提高50％，每炉钢的吹炼时间相应地缩短了三分之一左右，渣料也节约30％到50％；采用“严、保、早、防”四项措施炼钢，炉龄大大延长，钢锭合格率由原来97％—98％提高到99.6％以上，8月份夺得了全厂产量、质量、炉龄、降低消耗、安全、协作等六个方面的第一名。
    增产节约运动开展以来，杨德生小组掀起了劳动竞赛新高潮。在组与组的竞赛中，他们除了和天津市特等模范小组——天钢二厂一分厂王文华小组开展对口赛，并虚心学习王文华小组走群众路线的经验和他们的共产主义风格外，还和在同一个炉台上同一班操作的高文采小组签订了对口赛合同，帮助高文采小组提高技术，共同跃进。小组内部开展了思想好、生产好、完成本职任务好、安全好、协作好的“五好”对手竞赛。现在，全组已有十人获得五好组员称号。杨德生小组也被评为全厂的“五好”小组。（附图片）
