Xinhua News Agency, Havana, September 17th: The Cuban Presidential Palace Press Office announced this morning that the Cuban Revolutionary Government has decided to restrict the activities of the United States Ambassador to Cuba, Philip Bonsal, to within the Vedado district during the visit of the Cuban delegation led by Prime Minister Castro to the Fifteenth United Nations General Assembly. The US Embassy is located in this district of Havana.

The Cuban government's measure is in retaliation for the US authorities' blatant restrictions on the activities of Prime Minister Castro, who will attend the United Nations General Assembly, during his stay in the United States. US Secretary of State Herter announced at a press conference in Washington on the 13th that when Prime Minister Castro arrives in New York, his range of activities will be limited to Manhattan Island. This unreasonable action by the US government has aroused great indignation among the Cuban people.

The decision announced by the Cuban government stipulates that US Ambassador Bonsal may only cross the specified boundaries when traveling from his residence to the embassy and back during Prime Minister Castro's stay in New York, and must take a commonly used route. According to the notification from Foreign Minister Roa to US Ambassador Bonsal, the restrictions on Bonsal are also to provide security guarantees for him.

### 回击美国当局对卡斯特罗在美活动的限制  古巴政府限制美大使活动

    新华社哈瓦那17日电　古巴总统府新闻发布处今天早晨宣布，古巴革命政府决定在卡斯特罗总理率领的古巴代表团出席第十五届联合国大会期间，限制美国驻古巴大使邦沙尔只能在贝达多地区内活动。美国大使馆座落于哈瓦那的这个地区。
    古巴政府的这一措施是为回击美国当局蛮横地限制将出席联合国大会的卡斯特罗总理在美国逗留期间的活动而采取的。美国国务卿赫脱13日在华盛顿举行的记者招待会上曾经宣布，当卡斯特罗总理到达纽约以后，他的活动范围将只限于在曼哈顿岛。美国政府的这一无理行动，在古巴人民中引起了极大的愤慨。
    古巴政府宣布的决定规定，美国大使邦沙尔在卡斯特罗总理逗留纽约期间，只能在当他从住所到大使馆和从大使馆回去时越过规定的界限，并且还必须走一条通常走的道路。据外交部长罗亚给美国大使邦沙尔的通知说，对邦沙尔的限制同时是为了向他提供安全保证。
