Cotton Growing Expert Discusses Experiences

    Early Maturation and High Yield of Autumn Bolls Are Promising
    Discussing Experiences in Using Promotion and Control Methods in Late-Stage Cotton Management
    Researcher, Shaanxi Branch of the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences Zhang Qiuxiang
    For any crop to grow well and increase yield, it relies on people to reasonably promote it and control it. These two methods of promotion and control are applicable to all aspects of cotton growth, and they are particularly important in the current cotton management. This is a rule that our cotton growing team has gradually explored.
    This year, the midsummer period was too dry, and there has been a lot of cloudy and rainy weather since the beginning of autumn, leading to phenomena such as excessive growth and prolonged greenness in some cotton fields. Generally, there are more autumn bolls, green bolls, and small bolls in cotton fields than in previous years, and flower buds still appear and disappear. It seems that ensuring that autumn buds and autumn bolls do not fall off, do not rot, and mature early has become the key to late-stage cotton field management.
    Faced with the weather, ground temperature, and cotton growth conditions since the beginning of autumn, it is necessary to understand how to promote and how to control. In order to change the unfavorable conditions brought about by cloudy and rainy weather and enable cotton to develop normally, we mainly adopted the following five methods in terms of promotion: First, shaking the flowers to remove water. When there is too much rain, water accumulates in the center of the flower buds, affecting pollination, which is called flower flooding. Therefore, we shook the flowers to remove water on cloudy and rainy days to prevent flower flooding. Second, draining accumulated water. People often say, "Cotton likes warmth." With too much rain, the ground temperature is low, and cotton does not grow happily, which will lead to late maturation. Therefore, we drained accumulated water in the cotton fields after rain to increase the ground temperature. Third, pushing the plants together and merging the ridges. Cotton needs plenty of sunshine during the boll period. With too much rain, plus the lush foliage of the cotton, the shade is too great, and the development of bolls in the lower part of the cotton is greatly affected, and some have already begun to rot. Therefore, we successively pushed the plants together and merged the ridges four times, alternating between cloudy and sunny, to ensure ventilation and light penetration for the cotton. Fourth, preventing and controlling pests. Pests are the great enemies of cotton. With too much rain, cotton is most susceptible to red bollworms, leaf rollers, and bridge builders, which mainly bite and eat the leaves; if pests are not prevented and controlled, buds and bolls will fall off; even if many bolls are preserved, the end result will be a tree of green bolls, small in size, short in lint, and late in maturity. Therefore, we made up our minds: treat insects when they are small, prevent them early even if there are no insects. We carefully prevented them every three days, applying two catties of 100% 666 powder per mu of cotton field to protect buds and bolls, making the bolls large and mature early. Fifth, applying topdressing fertilizer. The more waterlogged the land, the more fertilizer needs to be applied. When cotton grows to the later stage, the fertility of the land is inherently low, and with more rain and waterlogging, nutrient imbalances occur, and cotton plants easily age. Therefore, since the beginning of September, we have applied three catties of superphosphate and twenty-five catties of ammonium sulfate per mu of cotton field to promote boll growth and accelerate maturity.
    In general, the various promoting effects in cotton cultivation do not solely rely on the natural growth of cotton but also rely on people's subjective initiative to supplement beneficial factors to the cotton.
    In terms of control, we mainly adopted the following four methods: First, picking off wilted flower caps. With too much rain, the flower caps on top of the green bolls accumulate water, and if they are not removed in time, boll rot will occur. Therefore, we picked off the wilted flower caps on cloudy and rainy days to prevent boll rot. Second, stepping on the base of the cotton plants. After rain, we stepped on the base of the cotton plants four times while pushing the plants together and merging the ridges. This is to damage some of the cotton's root hairs to avoid dispersing nutrients. Third, removing old leaves, removing buds, and removing cluster tips. These are very important for controlling excessive growth and prolonged greenness in cotton. According to our experience: when removing old leaves in the rainy season, remove more in dense areas and less in sparse areas. Remove both the lower and upper leaves. All leaves on the main stem, on old bolls, and on abscission nodes must be removed; it is even more important to remove aging old leaves. However, when removing old leaves, only remove the leaf blades, not the leaf stalks, to avoid consuming nutrients from the cotton stalks. All buds that grow between nodes or behind mature bolls must be removed to avoid consuming nutrients. The removal of cluster tips depends on the number of green bolls on the nodes: generally, when there are three or five green bolls and flower buds on the nodes, they should be removed; otherwise, if the cluster tips are not removed to protect the bolls and are allowed to continue growing, they will cause bud and boll drop and delay cotton boll maturity. Fourth, deep cultivation was carried out once. This not only dissipated moisture from the cotton field and increased the ground temperature but also cut off some of the cotton's root hairs, allowing nutrients to be concentrated for supply and controlling excessive growth.
    In general, the controlling effects in cotton cultivation do not solely rely on the natural growth of cotton but also rely on people's subjective initiative to remove unfavorable factors in cotton growth.
    Promotion and control cannot be completely separated into two separate things. The same cultivation measure has a promoting effect on some parts of the cotton but a controlling effect on other parts; similarly, another cultivation measure has a controlling effect on some parts of the cotton but a promoting effect on other parts. For example: we apply phosphate fertilizer to cotton mainly to promote the early appearance of autumn buds and the early formation of autumn bolls; however, it also makes the main stem squat and solid, controls excessive growth, and shortens the distance between nodes on the upper part of the main stem. Removing old leaves destroys some of the cotton's nutrient-producing organs, which plays a role in controlling excessive growth and prolonged greenness; however, it also reduces shade, which plays a role in promoting cotton ventilation and light penetration. It seems that there is control within promotion, and promotion within control, forming a dialectical relationship between promotion and control.
    Can increasing and preserving autumn bolls really increase production? Last year, the high-yield cotton cultivated by our cotton growing team also encountered rainy weather in the autumn, and some team members said that it was all over. However, we seized the sunny days during the cloudy and rainy weather and adopted methods such as pushing the plants together and merging the ridges, foliar spraying of phosphorus, removing old leaves, and deep cultivation, both promoting and controlling. As a result, all the autumn bolls formed in the later stage were preserved, and good cotton fibers were also produced. On average, each plant had thirty or so bolls, of which eleven were large autumn bolls. The amount of cotton picked from six or seven autumn bolls was more than that from many midsummer bolls, and the yield of autumn bolls accounted for more than one-third of the total yield. To take a recent fact: according to a survey in our cotton fields, each plant has already formed thirty or forty bolls, and autumn bolls generally account for 30% to 50%, and autumn buds are still appearing and disappearing. Li Xiuqin's cotton growing team in Liangcun Production Team, Shuangwang Management District, carefully managed the cotton fields after the rain, pruned and thinned the branches in a timely manner, prevented excessive growth, and each cotton plant formed five or six autumn bolls. This all shows that increasing and preserving autumn bolls to increase cotton production is very promising.
    Can the current autumn buds and autumn bolls produce cotton fibers at the end? "When the land god blooms yellow flowers, pick cotton near the stove," this is the experience summed up by our ancestors. Our current flower cultivation technology and flower cultivation conditions are much more advanced. According to the experience summed up by our ancestors, the current "Land God Festival" (September 17th) has just passed, and the current autumn buds can still be picked as flowers in the future. According to our cotton growing team's records last year: all the flower buds around the Mid-Autumn Festival produced good fibers and good flowers were picked. There are still more than ten days before the Mid-Autumn Festival, so there is no problem for the current autumn buds to pick good flowers in the future. In the past, we also thought that "flowers (flower buds) see flowers (cotton fibers), forty-eight (days)." In fact, according to our records last year: the flower buds in midsummer only took thirty days from bud formation to fiber production; the flower buds in autumn only took twenty-eight days from bud formation to fiber production. This is because autumn bolls grow in the upper part of the cotton, with not much shade, and the sunshine is more sufficient than that of midsummer bolls. Before the frost, it is still a season suitable for cotton growth. The frost period in our area has always been in late October, and there are still forty or so days before the frost period, so it is said that the current autumn buds will be able to produce cotton fibers at the end; there is no problem for autumn bolls to produce cotton fibers.
    The current time is the critical period for increasing cotton production. We must resolutely respond to the Party's call for increasing production and practicing economy, and strive for more production and early maturity of autumn cotton bolls. (Attached picture)

### 秋桃早熟高产大有指望　谈棉花后期管理中怎样运用促进和控制方法的经验

    秋桃早熟高产大有指望
　　谈棉花后期管理中怎样运用促进和控制方法的经验
    中国农业科学院陕西分院研究员　张秋香
    不管什么庄稼要长好，要增产，都是靠人合理促进它，控制它。促进和控制这两种方法，适用于整个棉花生长的各个环节，而在当前棉花管理中显得越发重要。这是我们植棉小组一步一步摸索出来的一条规律。
    今年三伏天太旱，立秋以来阴雨多，部分棉花发生陡长贪青等现象。一般棉田的秋桃、青桃、小桃比往年多，花蕾还时现时生。看来保证秋蕾秋桃不脱落，不霉烂，早吐絮，已成为棉田后期管理的关键。
    面对入秋以来的天气、地温和棉花生长情况，应当怎样促进，怎样控制，需要弄个明白。我们为了改变阴雨带来的不利条件，使棉花正常发育，在促进方面，主要采取了下面五种办法：一是摇花荷水。雨水一多，花蕾心积上水，影响受粉，叫做灌花。于是，我们便在阴雨天摇花荷水，防止灌花。二是排除积水。人常说“棉花喜温”。雨水一多，地气凉，棉花长不欢，就会晚熟。于是，我们便在雨后排除棉田积水，提高地温。三是推株并垅。棉花桃期需要多晒太阳。雨水一多，加上棉花枝叶茂盛，荫蔽过大，棉花腰部以下桃子的发育大受影响，有的已开始霉烂。于是，我们便接连阴阳倒换四次推株并垅，叫棉花通风透光。四是防治虫害。虫害是棉花的大敌人。雨水一多，棉花最容易发生红铃虫、卷叶虫、造桥虫，它们主要咬吃叶子；要不防治虫害，一来要落蕾落铃，二来就是保住很多桃子，落尾也会是一树青桃，长的小，绒也短，吐絮迟。于是，我们打定主意：有虫治小治了，无虫也要早防。每隔三天细防一次，每亩棉田打100％的六六六粉二斤，保蕾保铃，叫桃子大，早吐絮。五是施追肥。地越涝肥料越要赶上去。棉花生长到后期，地的肥劲本来小了，加上雨多地涝，养分失调，棉株容易衰老。于是，从9月上旬以来，我们便在每亩棉田施了三斤过磷酸钙、二十五斤硫酸铵，促进桃子成长，提早吐絮。
    总起来说，培育棉花中的种种促进作用，就是不单纯依靠棉花的天然成长，还依靠人的主观能动作用，给棉花增补有利因素。
    在控制方面，主要采取了下面四种办法：一是摘败花帽。雨水一多，青铃顶上的花帽有积水，如不及时摘掉，就会出现烂桃现象。因此，我们便在阴雨天摘掉败花帽，防止烂桃。二是踩棉花根部。雨后，我们在推株并垅的同时，顺行踩过四次棉花根部。这是破坏一些棉花毛根，避免分散养分。三是打老叶，打芽子，打群尖。这些，对于控制棉花陡长、贪青很重要。按照我们的经验：打老叶，在多雨季节里应当稠处多打，稀处少打。既打下部的，也打上部的。凡是主秆上、老桃上和脱落节上的，全要打掉；更要打掉衰老的老叶。不过打老叶时只打叶片，不打叶把，免得损耗棉秆上的养分。不管担子间或成桃后面长的芽子都要打掉，免得损耗养分。打群尖，要看担子上的青桃多少来定：一般担子上有三、五个青桃和花蕾时，就要打掉；不然，为护桃不打群尖，让它继续生长下去，一来会顶落蕾铃，二来会推迟棉桃吐絮。四是深中耕了一次。这不光散发了棉田的水分，提高了地温，还切断了棉花的部分毛根，使养分集中供应，控制了陡长。
    总起来说，培育棉花中的控制作用，就是不单纯依靠棉花的天然成长，还依靠人的主观能动作用，在棉花生长中去掉不利因素。
    促进和控制也不能截然分成两件事来看。同样一种作务措施，对于棉花的这部分起着促进作用，对于棉花的那部分却起着控制作用；同样，另一种作务措施，对于棉花的这部分起着控制作用，对于那部分却起着促进作用。比方说：我们给棉花追施磷肥，主要是促进棉花早现秋蕾，早成秋桃；可是，也使棉花的主秆蹲实了，控制了陡长，缩短了主秆上部担子与担子之间的距离。打老叶，破坏了棉花部分制造养分的器官，起着控制棉花陡长、贪青的作用；可是，也减少了荫蔽，起着促进棉花通风透光的作用。看来，促进里边有控制，控制里边有促进，形成了促进与控制之间的辩证关系。
    靠增保秋桃究竟能不能增产呢？去年我们植棉小组务育的丰产棉，秋后同样碰到多雨天气，当时有组员也说这下糟了。但我们借阴雨抢晴天，采取推株并垅、根外喷磷、打老叶、深中耕等办法，既促进，又控制。结果，后期结的秋桃全保住了，也吐出好花絮，平均每株座了三十来个桃子，从中就有十一个大秋桃。剥花量六个顶七个多伏桃，秋桃产量就占到总产量的三分之一多。再拿最近的事实说：根据在我们棉田调查，每株已经座住三、四十个桃子，一般秋桃就占到30％到50％，秋蕾还在时现时生。我们双王管理区梁村生产队李秀琴植棉组，雨后精细管理棉田，及时整枝打杈，防止了疯长，株株棉花都座成五、六个秋桃。这全说明靠增保秋桃增产棉花，大有指望。
    现在的秋蕾、秋桃，落尾能不能吐絮？“天社开黄花，灶火拾棉花”，这是祖辈们总结出来的经验。我们今天的务花技术，务花条件，要先进许多。就按祖辈们总结的经验看，现在“天社”（9月17日）刚过，当前的秋蕾日后还是能够拾到花的。我们植棉小组去年的记载：凡是中秋节前后的花蕾，全吐了好絮、拾了好花。眼前离中秋节还有十多天，现在的秋蕾日后拾好花更没什么问题。过去，我们也认为“花（花蕾）见花（吐絮），四十八（天）”。实际上，据我们去年记载：伏天的花蕾，从现蕾到吐絮，只有三十天；秋天的花蕾，从现蕾到吐絮，只不过二十八天。这是因为秋桃生在棉花上部，没多少荫蔽，日照比伏桃充分，降霜前，仍是适合棉花生长的节气。我们这一带历年来的降霜期在10月下旬，现在离降霜期还有四十来天，所以说，现在的秋蕾，落尾是能够吐絮的；至于秋桃吐絮更没什么问题。
    眼前是棉花增产的骨节眼。我们要坚决响应党的增产节约的号召，力争棉花秋桃多产、早熟。（附图片）
