Xinhua News Agency, Leopoldville, August 31st: The Foreign Ministers Conference of African Independent States closed today after seven days of discussions on the situation in the Congo and Africa.

Representatives from Ghana, Guinea, the United Arab Republic, the Congo, Sudan, Algeria, Ethiopia, Morocco, Somalia, Liberia, Tunisia, Togo, Cameroon, and the Mali Federation participated in the meeting. Observers from several Asian and African countries, including Angola, Ruanda-Urundi, Kenya, and the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, attended the meeting. Chen Jiakang, the Chinese Ambassador to the United Arab Republic, also attended the meeting as an observer.

Amid thunderous applause, cheers, and shouts of "Freedom, Freedom," the conference passed four resolutions. They are: a resolution on the situation in the Congo; a resolution on providing assistance to the Republic of the Congo from Africa; a resolution on cooperation between the Republic of the Congo and the United Nations; and a resolution on the summit conference of African Independent States.

Congolese Prime Minister Lumumba attended the closing meeting. Congolese government officials and many local people also attended the meeting.

Prime Minister Lumumba spoke at the closing session, expressing his gratitude for the support given to the Congo by African countries. He called on the Congolese people and the people of all African countries to unite and remain vigilant to defeat the imperialist conspiracy against the independence and freedom of the Congo and other African countries.

He called on the Congolese people to unite and liberate the Katanga province, an integral part of their homeland. He opposed the Belgian proposal to "neutralize" the two parts of the Congo, Katanga Province and Kasai Province. He said that the problem is that Belgium should completely withdraw its troops from these areas of the Congo. He said: "No part of Congolese territory can leave the sovereignty of this national government."

In his speech, he again accused UN Secretary-General Hammarskjöld. He said that the Congolese government had cooperated with the UN in the Congo. However, Hammarskjöld did the exact opposite and never consulted with the Congolese government.

He said that without economic independence, political independence would be incomplete. He emphasized that the Congo would rebuild their economic and social life with their own strength.

The head of the Algerian delegation, Mohammed Yazid, Minister of Information of the Provisional Government of Algeria, reaffirmed in his speech the support and solidarity of the fighting Algerians with the Republic of the Congo. He called on the people of African countries to unite in the struggle for independence and freedom.

The head of the Guinean delegation, Diallo Telli Boubacar, emphasized in his speech the support of the Guinean government and people for the struggle of the Congolese government and people against imperialist conspiracies and sabotage. He was confident that with the support of the African people and the people of the world, the Congolese government and people would defeat all imperialist conspiracies and safeguard their independence and integrity.

The head of the Ghanaian delegation, Kozo Botsio, Minister of Agriculture of Ghana, condemned in his speech the imperialist conspiracy aimed at splitting the Republic of the Congo. He assured the government and people of Ghana's support for the Republic of the Congo. He said that the sovereignty and integrity of the Republic of the Congo should be maintained. The imperialist attempts to regain what they had lost should be defeated.

Morocco's Minister of Public Affairs, Bousetta, also condemned the imperialist conspiracy in Katanga and emphasized that Katanga is part of the Congo.

Other representatives also assured their support for the struggle of the Congolese government and people for national independence in their speeches. Diallo, Secretary-General of the All-African Peoples' Conference, assured that all African people support their Congolese brothers.

In the resolution on the situation in the Congo, the conference "considers that the independence and sovereignty of the Republic of the Congo is unified and indivisible" and "declares that it is necessary to maintain the territorial unity and integrity of the Republic of the Congo."

The conference "condemns all colonialist conspiracies aimed at splitting the territory of the Republic of the Congo" and "fully supports the central government of the Republic of the Congo. Given that the central government of the Republic of the Congo has established and consolidated the independence, unity, and territorial integrity of the Republic of the Congo, it is the only legitimate government."

The conference "issues an urgent and solemn appeal to all leaders of the Republic of the Congo to maintain this unity in order to achieve understanding and further cooperation in the highest interests of the Congo and Africa."

In the resolution on assisting the Republic of the Congo, the conference said that the Congolese government's call for assistance from African independent countries received an immediate, spontaneous, and positive response from African independent countries. The conference "decides to make efforts in this regard." The conference "expresses the hope that African assistance in this area will become greater and faster, and hopes that African countries will coordinate the assistance provided to the Republic of the Congo so that it can be distributed rationally and ensure maximum efficiency."

In the resolution on the summit conference of African Independent States, the conference "recommends that a summit conference of African Independent States be held to specifically study issues related to the African continent, and generally study world issues, and emphasizes the urgent nature and significant benefits contained in such a high-level meeting." The conference expresses the hope that "this wish of all African peoples will be realized for the benefit of African independence and unity, and for the liberation, freedom, and prosperity of all residents of Africa."

This resolution says, "Let the heads of African independent countries themselves decide to use diplomatic means or any other method they deem convenient to consult on this issue in order to decide on the form of such a meeting."

In the resolution on cooperation between the Republic of the Congo and the United Nations, the conference declares the necessity of cooperation between the United Nations Organization and the Republic of the Congo. However, the conference "regrets that some events have affected the originally full cooperation between the government of the Republic of the Congo and the United Nations Organization," and the conference "expresses the hope that similar events will not occur again and that all necessary measures will be taken to achieve reconciliation again until the United Nations Organization's mission in the Congo is completed."

    在雷鸣般的掌声、欢呼声和“自由、自由”的口号声中，会议通过了四项决议。它们是：关于刚果形势的决议；关于非洲对刚果共和国提供援助的决议；关于刚果共和国和联合国之间的合作的决议；关于非洲独立国家首脑会议的决议。
    刚果总理卢蒙巴出席了闭幕会议。刚果政府官员和很多当地的人士也出席了会议。
    卢蒙巴总理在闭幕会上讲话，表示感谢非洲国家给予刚果的支持。他号召刚果人民和非洲各国人民团结起来并保持警惕，以击败帝国主义反对刚果和其他非洲国家的独立和自由的阴谋。
    他要求刚果人民团结一致，解放他们祖国的组成部分加丹加省。他反对比利时提出的使刚果的两个部分加丹加省和开赛省“中立化”的建议。他说，问题在于，比利时应该把他们在刚果这些地方的部队完全撤出。他说：“刚果领土的任何部分都不能离开这个国家政府的主权。”
    他在讲话中再次指责了联合国秘书长哈马舍尔德。他说，刚果政府在刚果同联合国进行了合作。但是，哈马舍尔德却完全相反，他从没有同刚果政府磋商。
    他说，如果没有经济独立，政治独立将是不完全的。他强调说，刚果将以他们自己的力量重建他们的经济和社会生活。
    阿尔及利亚代表团团长、阿尔及利亚临时政府宣传部长穆罕默德·亚齐德在发言中重新保证战斗的阿尔及利亚人支持并声援刚果共和国。他号召非洲国家人民在争取独立和自由的斗争中团结起来。

    加纳代表团团长、加纳农业部长科佐·博齐约在发言中指责帝国主义旨在分裂刚果共和国的阴谋。他保证加纳政府和人民支持刚果共和国。他说，刚果共和国的主权和完整应该维护。帝国主义企图重新取得他们丧失的东西的阴谋应该被击败。
    摩洛哥代表、摩洛哥公共事务大臣布塞塔在发言中也指责帝国主义在加丹加的阴谋，并强调加丹加是刚果的一部分。
    其他代表在发言中也保证支持刚果政府和人民争取民族独立的斗争。全非人民大会秘书长迪亚洛在发言中保证全体非洲人民支持他们的刚果兄弟。
    会议在关于刚果形势的决议中，“认为刚果共和国的独立和主权是统一而不可分割的”，并且“宣布有必要维护刚果共和国的领土统一和完整”。
    会议“谴责一切目的在于分裂刚果共和国领土的殖民主义阴谋”，并且“完全支持刚果共和国的中央政府。鉴于刚果共和国中央政府建立并巩固了刚果共和国的独立、统一和领土完整，它是唯一合法的政府。”
    会议“向刚果共和国的全体领袖发出一项紧迫的和庄严的呼吁，要求维护这种统一以便为了刚果和非洲的最高利益取得谅解和进一步合作”。
    会议在关于援助刚果共和国的决议中说，刚果政府呼吁非洲独立国家提供援助，这种兄弟般的呼吁立即获得了非洲独立国家自发的和积极的响应。会议“决定在这方面进行努力”。会议“表示希望，非洲在这方面的援助将变得更多更快，并且希望，非洲国家将协调提供给刚果共和国的援助，以便能合理地进行分配，并保证有最大的效率。”
    在关于非洲独立国家首脑会议的决议中，会议“建议举行非洲独立国家首脑会议，特别研究同非洲大陆有关的问题，和一般地研究世界问题，并强调这样一个最高级会议所含有的迫切性质和重大好处。”会议表示希望，“所有非洲各国人民的这种愿望得以实现，以利于非洲的独立和团结，以利于非洲所有居民的解放、自由和繁荣。”
    这项决议说，“让非洲独立国家的首脑自己决定利用外交途径或他们认为方便的任何其他方法来磋商这个问题，以便决定这样一个会议的方式。”
    在关于刚果共和国和联合国之间合作的决议中，会议宣称联合国组织和刚果共和国之间合作的必要性。可是会议“感到遗憾的是，发生的一些事件影响了刚果共和国政府和联合国组织之间本来应该是完全的合作”，会议“表示希望不再发生类似事件和采取一切必要措施再次实现和解，直到联合国组织在刚果的任务完成时为止”。
