Organizing Teacher In-service Training in Connection with Reality, Rationally Arranging for Concise Explanation and Ample Practice
Shanghai Primary and Secondary Schools Summarize Teaching Reform Experiences

  (Our dispatch) Shanghai's educational administrative departments and the Party organizations of primary and secondary schools have mobilized teachers to summarize their teaching reform experiences in preparation for continuing teaching reform experiments in the new academic year.

  Shanghai's primary and secondary school teaching reform work began in February of this year. Before the reform, many schools organized teachers to study Chairman Mao's works and the Party's educational policy. At the same time, they organized teachers and students to participate in labor and connect with production realities to prepare for teaching reform. Teachers from the First Affiliated High School of East China Normal University, Fuxing Middle School, and other schools also specifically visited universities to investigate the students' actual knowledge levels. Through investigation and research, teachers realized that the current primary and secondary education could meet the requirements of "appropriately shortening the years, appropriately increasing the level, appropriately controlling class hours, and appropriately increasing labor." Therefore, they actively requested to carry out teaching reforms. During the reform process, on the one hand, the Municipal Education Department established a primary and secondary school curriculum innovation committee centered on East China Normal University, absorbing excellent teachers from universities, middle schools, and primary schools throughout the city to participate in the formulation of the new school system and the compilation of new teaching materials. On the other hand, teachers in various schools also made appropriate simplifications, deepenings, and updates to the existing curriculum based on the spirit of innovation, added modern content, and improved teaching methods. Many school teachers organized themselves for in-service training while reforming teaching, with some universities, middle schools, and primary schools collaborating and providing assistance at each level. In terms of teaching equipment, various schools also supplemented and self-made new teaching aids.

  After the reform, due to the reasonable curriculum arrangement and teachers adopting new teaching methods such as "concise explanation and ample practice," there was extra classroom time, allowing students to do more exercises in class. The Affiliated High School of East China Normal University, the First Normal School Affiliated Primary School, and others have experienced improved teaching quality and reduced student burden after the reform, giving students more time to participate in scientific and technological activities, productive labor, and sports activities. Many teachers believe that in the future, in addition to participating in industrial and agricultural labor, primary and secondary school students should also appropriately participate in social public welfare labor and service labor in order to establish the idea that all labor is glorious among students.

  Regarding the issue of appropriately simplifying, deepening, and updating the original curriculum, teachers in various schools have conducted experiments to varying degrees in the past six months. For example, in physics classes, redundant and outdated content was simplified, and content related to current production realities and conducive to improving basic theoretical knowledge, such as radio and electrical engineering, and related experiments, were added. Chemistry classes attempted to teach based on the structure of matter, supplemented new content, reduced class hours, and made it easier for students to understand. In mathematics teaching, approximation calculations, drawing and measurement, and other parts closely related to production were added. Regarding these relatively successful practices, the summary pointed out that simplifying, deepening, and updating the original curriculum must pay attention to: not weakening the teaching of basic knowledge; emphasizing scientific analysis and processing; paying attention to the connection with courses above, below, and on the sides; and having appropriate teaching methods without increasing the burden on students.

  "Concise explanation and ample practice" is one of the important contents of reforming teaching methods. Many schools organized teachers for special discussions, and most teachers explored it in actual teaching. Before teaching the chapter "Periodic Law and Periodic Table of Elements" in high school chemistry, a chemistry teacher at Shidong Middle School, after research, believed that the content of the textbook was still based on the views of a hundred years ago, did not deeply reflect the law of the gradual change of element properties, and did not mention the sub-group elements that have been widely used in modern industrial production. Therefore, when teaching, the teacher used the theory of atomic structure to explain the law of the gradual change of element properties in the periodic table and supplemented the sub-group elements. This not only improved the quality of teaching but also simplified the class hours, giving students more time to engage in science, technology, labor, and other activities. Based on these situations, everyone affirmed that the so-called "concise explanation and ample practice" should mean that teachers fully study the teaching materials, master the key points, difficulties, and critical parts of the teaching materials, explain these parts in depth and thoroughly, and at the same time, in the teaching process, fully pay attention to giving play to students' learning enthusiasm, allowing students to practice and exercise more within their capabilities.

  Shanghai's educational administrative departments are preparing to concentrate these reform experiences and formulate primary and secondary school teaching plans and teaching syllabuses for each subject so that schools can follow them. Schools can continue to carry out reform experiments after completing the basic requirements of the teaching syllabus. (Gao Jie)

    联系实际组织教师进修  合理安排做到精讲多练
    上海中小学总结教学改革经验
  本报讯　上海市教育行政部门和中小学校党组织，发动教师总结教学改革的经验，准备在新的学年中继续进行教学改革试验。
    上海中小学教学改革工作，从今年2月开始。改革前，许多学校组织教师学习毛主席著作和党的教育方针。同时，组织教师、学生参加劳动，联系生产实际，为教学改革作准备。华东师大第一附中、复兴中学等校教师还专门访问了大学，调查研究学生的实际知识水平。通过调查研究，教师们认识到现行中小学教育可以做到“适当缩短年限，适当提高程度，适当控制学时，适当增加劳动”的要求，因而积极地要求进行教学改革；在改革的过程中，一方面由市教育部门领导成立了以华东师大为中心的中小学课程革新委员会，吸收全市大中小学优秀教师参加制订新学制，编写新教材；另一方面，各校教师也根据革新精神，对现有课程作了适当的精简、加深、更新，增加现代化内容，同时在教学方法上加以改进。许多学校教师一边改革教学，一边自觉组织起来进修，有的大中小学协作挂钩，层层帮助。在教学设备方面，各校也进行了补充和自制新的教具。
    改革后，由于课程安排合理，教师采取了“精讲多练”等新的教学方法，课堂时间有了多余，可以让学生在课内多作练习。华东师大附中、第一师范附小等，改革后都出现了教学质量提高，学生负担减轻的现象，使学生有较多时间参加科技活动、生产劳动和体育活动。很多教师认为，今后中小学生除了参加工农业劳动外，还应适当参加社会公益劳动和服务性劳动，以便在学生中树立一切劳动都光荣的思想。
    关于对原有课程进行适当精简、加深、更新问题，半年来各校教师都进行了不同程度的试验。如在物理课中精简了重复、陈旧的内容，增加了联系当前生产实际和有助于提高基础理论知识的无线电、电工学等内容和有关的实验；化学课尝试以物质结构为纲进行教学，补充了新内容，减少了课时，学生也易于理解；在数学教学中补充了近似计算、制图与测量等密切联系生产的部分。对这些比较成功的做法，总结中指出，对原有课程进行精简、加深、更新，必须注意：不削弱基础知识的讲授；重视科学的分析和处理，注意与上下左右的课程衔接；要有适当的教学方法，不增加学生负担。
    “精讲多练”是改革教学方法的重要内容之一。很多学校组织教师作了专题讨论，绝大部分教师在实际教学中作了探索。市东中学化学教师在讲高一化学课中“周期率和元素周期表”一章前经过研究，认为教材内容还是根据一百年前的观点，没有深刻反映元素性质递变的规律，而且对现代工业生产中已经广泛应用的副族元素，一点没有提到。因此，教师讲授时，改用原子结构的理论，讲清周期表中元素性质递变的规律，同时补充了副族元素。这样不仅提高了讲课质量，而且精简了课时，学生也有更多时间从事科技、劳动等活动。根据这些情况，大家肯定认为所谓“精讲多练”应当是教师充分地钻研教材，掌握了教材中的重点、难点和关键，把这些部分讲深讲透，同时在教学过程中，充分注意到发挥学生的学习积极性，让学生在力所能及的条件下多实践、多练习。
  上海教育行政部门准备集中这些改革经验，制订出中小学教学计划和各科教学大纲，使各校有所遵循。各校可以在完成了教学大纲的基本要求条件下，继续进行改革试验。　（高洁）
