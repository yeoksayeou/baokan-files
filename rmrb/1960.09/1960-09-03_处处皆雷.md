　　Everywhere is a Minefield

　　When people think of landmines, they usually picture a round iron ball. But after seeing the diverse and varied landmines displayed in the Anti-Japanese War Hall of the Chinese People's Revolutionary Military Museum, you will be amazed and impressed!

　　During the Anti-Japanese War, the mass-based guerrilla warfare widely carried out by the Party leading the people behind enemy lines, especially the mass-based blasting movement universally carried out in various liberated areas, made the enemy tremble with fear and unable to move an inch.

　　Filled with boundless hatred for the enemy, the people used their own intelligent hands to create all kinds of landmines, including blasting mines, double-eared mines, hand grenades, and jumping mines. Furthermore, in the absence of iron, they used ceramics, stones, and wood to create ingenious landmines. Whether it was bowls, pots, pans, bottles, lamps, doors, or windows, everything would explode upon contact. Truly, everywhere was a minefield, and everything could explode, inflicting significant casualties on the enemy. The enemy's modern magnetic mine detectors were completely unable to detect the earthen mines made of stone and ceramics, thereby severely打击ing the enemy's frenzied looting activities and stopping the enemy from advancing.

    处处皆雷
    一提到地雷，在人们概念中一定是一个圆铁蛋。可是你看了中国人民革命军事博物馆抗日战争馆里陈列的多种多样形形色色的地雷，就会惊奇和赞叹不已！
    在抗日战争期间，党领导敌后人民广泛开展的群众性的游击战争，特别是在各个解放区所普遍开展的群众性爆破运动，使敌人胆战心惊，寸步难行。
    人民群众怀着对敌的无比仇恨，用自己智慧的双手创造出各式各样的地雷，有爆破雷、双耳雷、手雷和跳雷，并且在缺少铁的情况下，就利用陶瓷、石头和木材制造出奇妙的地雷。不管是碗、壶、锅、瓶、灯、门窗，都能一触即响，真是处处皆雷、物物都炸，给予敌人以重大杀伤。敌人用现代化的磁性扫雷器根本探察不出我们用石头和陶瓷造的土雷，从而狠狠打击了敌人疯狂的抢劫活动，阻止了敌人前进。　（晓白）（附图片）
