Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, September 2nd: According to the Vietnam News Agency, General Vo Nguyen Giap, Commander-in-Chief of the Vietnam People's Army, issued an order to the entire army today at the grand military parade in Hanoi celebrating the 15th anniversary of the founding of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam.

In his order, General Vo Nguyen Giap outlined the heroic history of struggle of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam over the past fifteen years and the great achievements made in all fields. He then said, "While the people of the North are excitedly building a new life, the U.S. imperialists and their lackeys – the ruling clique in the South – are continuing to undermine the Geneva Accords, divide our country, and turn South Vietnam into a new colony and military base of the United States." He said, "However, the more the U.S. imperialists and their lackeys intensify their suppression and plunder, the more our compatriots across the country hate them, the more they strengthen their unity, and the more actively they struggle against the U.S.-Ngo clique, demanding the implementation of the Geneva Accords and striving for the peaceful reunification of the motherland."

He expressed a warm welcome to the people in South Vietnam who are persisting in and developing the national democratic revolution, and bravely carrying out the anti-U.S. patriotic struggle.

Vo Nguyen Giap announced: "The reunification of the motherland is the legitimate and sacred desire of our people across the country, and it is the iron will of the people across the country. The Vietnamese nation is a single entity, and the Vietnamese nation is a single entity, which no one can divide. Our people's just struggle will surely be victorious. Our Vietnam will surely be unified."

When talking about the current international situation, General Vo Nguyen Giap pointed out that the socialist system has transcended the scope of one country, and the strength of the socialist camp headed by the great Soviet Union is stronger than ever, and is advancing rapidly in all aspects to surpass the imperialist countries. In Asia, the People's Republic of China has been born and has become an important member of the socialist camp and a major factor in international political life. At present, the national liberation movement throughout Asia, Africa, and Latin America is surging forward with an unstoppable torrent. Recently, the Lao people have also stood up to oppose the U.S. imperialist interventionists, demanding independence and peace.

Vo Nguyen Giap said that the forces of socialism, national independence, democracy, and peace have been unprecedentedly strengthened. Progressive people all over the world are rising up, expanding and strengthening unity, to stop the provocations of the imperialist warmongers, demanding disarmament, and carrying out unremitting struggles to safeguard lasting world peace. He also pointed out that the imperialists headed by U.S. imperialism are continuing the arms race, strengthening various military aggression blocs, creating tense situations, and preparing for war. The U.S. imperialist policy of intervention in South Vietnam and Laos is a component part of its overall conspiracy with the Southeast Asian aggression bloc.

Vo Nguyen Giap emphasized that we must not relax our struggle against U.S. imperialism at any time.

General Vo Nguyen Giap called on all armed forces to "continuously improve their fighting will and revolutionary vigilance, actively defend the airspace, territorial waters, borders, and demarcation lines, and be ready at all times to crush all the insidious plots of imperialist aggression."

    越南人民军总司令武元甲大将发布命令
    和平统一祖国是越南人民的钢铁意志
    号召全军提高警惕准备粉碎帝国主义的侵略阴谋
    新华社河内2日电　据越南通讯社报道：越南人民军总司令武元甲大将今天在河内举行的越南民主共和国成立十五周年庆祝典礼的盛大阅兵式上，向全军发布命令。
    武元甲大将在命令中概述了越南民主共和国十五年来的英勇斗争史实和在各方面取得的伟大成就。接着，他说：“当北方人民正在兴奋地建设新的生活的时候，美帝国主义及其走狗——南方的统治集团，却继续在破坏日内瓦协议，分裂我们的国家，使越南南方成为美国的新的殖民地和军事基地。”他说：“但是，美帝国主义及其走狗越加强镇压和掠夺，我们全国同胞越高度地仇恨他们，越发加强团结一致，并且越发积极地为反对美吴集团，要求实现日内瓦协议，争取和平统一祖国而斗争。”
    他对在越南南方坚持和发展民族民主革命，英勇地进行反美爱国斗争的人民，表示热烈欢迎。
    武元甲宣布：“祖国的统一是我们全国人民正当的和神圣的愿望，是全国人民钢铁般的意志。越南国家是一个整体，越南民族是一个整体，是没有任何人可以分割的。我国人民的正义斗争一定胜利。我们越南一定统一。”
    武元甲大将在谈到目前的国际形势时指出，社会主义制度已经超越一国范围，以伟大的苏联为首的社会主义阵营的力量比任何时候都强大，并正在从各方面超过帝国主义各国的道路上猛进。在亚洲，中华人民共和国已经诞生，成为社会主义阵营中的一个重要成员，国际政治生活中的一个重大因素。目前，整个亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲的民族解放运动正在掀起势不可挡的滚滚怒涛。最近老挝人民也已经站起来反对美帝国主义干涉者，要求独立与和平。
    武元甲说，社会主义、民族独立、民主和平的力量已空前壮大，全世界进步的人们正在起来，扩大和加强团结，为制止帝国主义战争贩子的挑衅，要求实行裁军和为维护世界持久和平而进行不懈的斗争。他又指出，以美帝国主义为首的帝国主义者，正在继续进行军备竞赛，加强各军事侵略集团，制造紧张局势，准备战争，美帝国主义对越南南方和老挝的干涉政策，就是它和东南亚侵略集团总的阴谋中的组成部分。
    武元甲强调说，我们时刻也不能放松反对美帝国主义的斗争。
    武元甲大将号召全体武装力量，“必须不断提高战斗意志和革命的警惕性，积极地捍卫领空、领海、边境和分界线，随时随地粉碎帝国主义侵略的一切狠毒阴谋。”
