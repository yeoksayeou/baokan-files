Factory-Team Hookup, Top-Down Integration, Close Collaboration, Crash Program
Matou Commune Prepares "Three Autumns" Tools Quickly and Well

(Our newspaper, Tianjin, 11th) The agricultural implement repair factory of the Matou People's Commune in Wuqing County, Hebei Province, in response to the large and demanding tasks of this year's "Three Autumns" production, has adopted the method of "factory-team hookup, top-down integration, close collaboration, and large-scale crash program" to fully rush the production of "Three Autumns" tools. As of September 5th, it has manufactured more than 700 pieces of semi-mechanized large-scale agricultural tools such as deep plows, wheat sowing machines, sweet potato diggers, slicers, and starch machines, as well as more than 40,000 pieces of various small agricultural tools. It has also repaired and modified more than 60,000 pieces of small agricultural tools, completing 92% of the planned tasks for "Three Autumns" tool repair and manufacture.

"Factory-team hookup and top-down integration" can leverage the manpower and material resources of the production teams, working in division of labor and cooperation with the repair factory to accelerate the production of "Three Autumns" tools. This repair factory has adopted the method of "two releases," releasing a portion of its technicians and production equipment to the production teams to help them organize skilled craftsmen and establish 184 iron-wood joint repair groups. With the help of the agricultural implement repair factory, these repair groups can not only repair and make various small agricultural tools, but also undertake the manufacture of iron and wood parts for various semi-mechanized agricultural tools. This reduces the burden on the agricultural implement repair factory to repair and manufacture small agricultural tools, allowing it to concentrate its main efforts on rushing the production of main components for semi-mechanized large-scale agricultural tools. This method of top-down integration and division of labor and cooperation has enabled the "Three Autumns" tool production tasks to be completed quickly and well this year.

The Matou People's Commune has planted a total of 180,000 mu of corn and sweet potatoes this year, accounting for more than half of the commune's cultivated land. The autumn wheat sowing area has also been expanded compared to last year, and the area for autumn harvest and autumn planting has increased by 40% compared to last year. At the same time, the commune party committee proposed: "We must ensure a bumper harvest of autumn crops, not losing a single grain, and harvesting and processing them well; we must also ensure that wheat is planted early and well, achieving rational close planting, standardization, and field management." Therefore, it is necessary to vigorously promote tool reform and produce a large number of high-efficiency, labor-saving "Three Autumns" tools. Under this situation, the commune's agricultural implement repair factory, under the leadership of the commune party committee and in cooperation with relevant departments, conducted a comprehensive tool inspection in the production teams in late June. Through investigation and calculation, more than 50,000 various "Three Autumns" tools need to be produced this year, and more than 70,000 need to be repaired. If this batch of tasks were to be undertaken solely by the agricultural implement repair factory and the existing two repair stations, it would take until February of next year to complete. Based on this situation, they decided to adopt the method of "factory-team hookup and top-down integration" to help the production teams establish and improve the repair network and carry out mass crash programs to rush the production of "Three Autumns" tools. In just twenty days, they helped each management area establish repair stations and each production team establish iron-wood joint repair groups. The agricultural implement repair factory, in response to the characteristics of the various repair groups having many woodworkers and low technical skills, adopted the "three guarantees" method of division of labor and cooperation, which is: the repair factory guarantees the manufacturing tasks of mechanized and semi-mechanized agricultural tools and the iron parts of major tools; the repair station guarantees the manufacturing of small agricultural tools and the assembly tasks of iron-wood combined tools; the repair group guarantees the manufacturing of wooden agricultural tools and the repair tasks of small agricultural tools. Through this method, the speed of manufacturing and repairing "Three Autumns" tools has been greatly accelerated. The commune's daily production of slicers jumped from two units to twenty-one units. In a short period of ten days, the commune manufactured more than 700 semi-mechanized large-scale agricultural tools.

In the process of repairing and manufacturing "Three Autumns" tools, they focused on wheat planting, sweet potato digging, sweet potato processing, and corn threshing, based on the characteristics of this year's crops. They divided the areas into batches, concentrated their strength, and launched crash campaigns. In the first campaign in early August, the commune's manufacturing and repair forces concentrated on large-scale repair and manufacturing, completing more than 50% of the total repair and manufacturing tasks in ten days, providing timely support for the commune's current production. In the second campaign in mid-August, more than 300 high-efficiency semi-mechanized agricultural tools such as sweet potato diggers, slicers, and deep plows were manufactured. During the crash campaigns, the repair factory, repair stations, and repair groups competed and helped each other, and exchanged experiences in a timely manner, improving production efficiency.

The workers in the repair groups are both skilled craftsmen and farmers, and they are very familiar with the specifications and performance of various agricultural tools. In the process of manufacturing agricultural tools, many production teams, based on the situation of their full and semi-labor forces, divided the hoes, spades, and other small agricultural tools they produced into several specifications of different weights and sizes, which were very easy for the commune members to use. In the Songliukou Production Team, twenty-five commune members used sickles with their left hands, and the repair group specially made twenty-five left-handed sickles for them.

    厂队挂钩　上下结合　密切协作　突击修制
    码头公社准备“三秋”工具又快又好
    本报天津11日电　河北省武清县码头人民公社农具修配厂，针对今年“三秋”生产任务大、要求高的情况，采取“厂队挂钩、上下结合、密切协作、大搞突击”的方法，全力赶制“三秋”工具。截至9月5日，已制造出深耕犁、小麦播种机、刨薯机、切片机、淀粉机等半机械化大型农具七百多件，各种小农具四万多件，还修理和改制了六万多件小农具，已完成“三秋”工具修制计划任务的92％。
    “厂队挂钩、上下结合”，可以发挥生产队人力、物力的作用，同修配厂分工合作，加速生产“三秋”工具。这个修配厂采取“两放”的办法，把一部分技术工人和生产设备下放给生产队，帮助各生产队组织能工巧匠建立了一百八十四个铁木联合修配组。这些修配组在农具修配厂的帮助下，既能修理和打制各种小农具，又能承制各种半机械化农具的铁木配件。这样，就减少了农具修配厂配修小农具的负担，能够集中主要精力突击赶制半机械化大型农具的主件。这种上下结合分工合作的方法，使今年的“三秋”工具生产任务完成得又快又好。
    码头人民公社今年种植的玉米、甘薯共十八万亩，占全社耕地的一半以上，今秋小麦播种面积也比去年扩大，秋收秋种的面积比去年增加40％。同时，公社党委提出：“既要确保秋季作物丰产丰收，一粒不丢，收好加工好；又要保证小麦种早种好，实现合理密植化、规格化、园田化”。因此，需要大搞工具改革，生产大量的工效高、省劳力的“三秋”工具。在这种形势下，公社农具修配厂于6月下旬，在公社党委的领导下，和有关部门配合深入生产队，普遍进行了一次工具大检查。通过摸底算账，今年需要生产的各种“三秋”工具有五万多件，需要修理的有七万多件。这批任务如果单靠农具修配厂和原有的两个修配站承制，需要到明年2月份才能完成。根据这一情况，他们决定采取“厂队挂钩、上下结合”的办法，帮助各生产队建立健全修配网，开展群众性的突击赶制“三秋”工具的活动。仅用二十天的时间，就帮助各管理区建立了修配站，各生产队建立了铁、木工联合修配组。农具修配厂针对各修配组木工多、技术低的特点，采取了分工合作的“三包”方法，就是修配厂包机械化半机械化农具和主要工具铁活配件的制造任务；修配站包小农具制造和铁木合制工具的装配任务；修配组包木农具制造和小农具修理任务。通过这种方法，大大加快了制造和修理“三秋”工具的速度。全社每天由生产两台切片机一跃而达到日产二十一台。在短短的十天里，全社就制造出七百多台半机械化的大型农具。
    在修制“三秋”工具的过程中，他们根据今年种植作物的特点，以种麦、刨薯、甘薯加工、玉米脱粒为主，分区分批，集中力量，开展突击战役。在8月上旬的第一个战役里，全社的制造修配力量集中大搞修配，十天就完成全部修配任务50％以上，及时支援了公社当前的生产。在8月中旬的第二个战役里，制造了各种高工效的刨薯机、切片机、深耕犁等半机械化农具三百多台。在突击战役中，修配厂、修配站、修配组之间互相竞赛，互相帮助，及时交流经验，提高了生产效率。
    修配组的工人既是能工巧匠，又是农民，他们很熟悉各种农具的规格性能。许多生产队在制造农具过程中，根据本队整、半劳力等情况，生产的镐、锄等小农具分成轻重不一、大小不一的几种规格，社员们使用起来非常顺手。宋留口生产队有二十五个社员是左手用镰刀，修配组就特为他们打制了二十五把左手镰。
