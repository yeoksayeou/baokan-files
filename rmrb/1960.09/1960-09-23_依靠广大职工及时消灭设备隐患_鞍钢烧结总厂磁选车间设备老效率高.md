Relying on the Broad Masses of Workers to Eliminate Equipment Hazards in a Timely Manner
Angang Steel's Sintering Plant, Magnetic Separation Workshop - Old Equipment, High Efficiency

(Our Correspondent in Anshan, 22nd) The Magnetic Separation Workshop of Angang Steel's Sintering Plant is a red banner in Angang's ore dressing system for improving equipment operating rates. In the movement for increasing production and practicing economy, the workers in this workshop implemented a new method of maintaining and repairing equipment called "eliminating hidden dangers," which reduced the time that equipment failures affected production to a minimum, and further improved equipment operating rates. In August, the equipment operating rate reached as high as 97.52%, an average increase of 1.72% compared to the previous seven months; in the first ten days of September, it further improved significantly compared to August. This workshop has a history of thirty-five years and is the oldest workshop in Angang's various ore dressing plants, with outdated equipment. However, from the beginning of last year to the present, this workshop has maintained an equipment operating rate of over 95% for twenty consecutive months, effectively guaranteeing the sustained leap forward in concentrate production.

In order to eliminate hidden dangers in every machine and continuously improve equipment operating rates, in addition to maintenance workers adhering to scheduled regular maintenance, the production workers in this workshop meticulously maintain the equipment at all times. Production workers have all learned simple repair techniques for minor or zero repairs, and each worker has more than a dozen tools such as hammers, wrenches, and pliers readily available. As soon as a machine has even the slightest problem, the workers can immediately diagnose the root cause, pick up a tool, tighten a screw, add oil, insert a shim... and quickly return the machine to normal operation. In order to consolidate the "eliminate hidden dangers" maintenance method, the workers established a system of researching and finding solutions before shifts and mutual inspection and evaluation after shifts, and incorporated equipment maintenance as an important part of the competition.

Close collaboration between production workers and maintenance workers is an important aspect of the "eliminate hidden dangers" activity in this workshop. Maintenance workers established diagnostic records for each machine and were stationed "camping" at the machines around the clock in three shifts. Production workers actively informed the maintenance workers of the machine's operating conditions, and they studied together and jointly devised solutions. Production workers and maintenance workers also launched a contest. Production workers guaranteed to identify hidden dangers clearly, and maintenance workers guaranteed to repair quickly and well. The competition involved both competition and mutual assistance. For each repair, they jointly arranged spare parts, time, and personnel in advance, and at the start of the repair, they all helped their opponents, greatly shortening the repair time. In order to "diagnose" less easily detected hidden dangers more accurately and eliminate them in a timely manner, the party branch secretary took charge, and a "four-way combination" medical team composed of veteran production workers, veteran maintenance workers, technicians, and leading cadres was formed to regularly go deep into the teams to conduct comprehensive consultations on the equipment.

The experience of Angang Steel's Sintering Plant's Magnetic Separation Workshop in improving equipment operating rates has been valued by fraternal units. Ore dressing plants (workshops) such as East Anshan, Dagushan, Gongchangling, and Benxi Nanfen have sent people to visit and learn.

### 依靠广大职工及时消灭设备隐患　鞍钢烧结总厂磁选车间设备老效率高

　　依靠广大职工及时消灭设备隐患
　　鞍钢烧结总厂磁选车间设备老效率高
    本报鞍山22日电　鞍钢烧结总厂磁选车间是鞍钢选矿系统提高设备作业率的一面红旗。在增产节约运动中，这个车间的职工实行了“灭隐患”的维护检修设备的新方法，使设备故障影响生产的时间减少到更低限度，设备作业率又有新的提高。8月份设备作业率高达97.52％，比前七个月平均提高1.72％；9月上旬又比8月份提高了一大步。这个车间已有三十五年历史，是鞍钢各选矿厂中最老的车间，设备陈旧。但是，从去年初到现在，这个车间已经连续二十个月设备作业率保持在95％以上，有力地保证了精矿生产持续跃进。
    为了消除每一台机器的隐患，不断提高设备作业率，除检修工人坚持按计划定期检修以外，这个车间的生产工人每时每刻都精心维护设备。生产工人都学会了零修或小修的简单技术，每个工人身边都准备着锤子、搬子、钳子等十几种工具。只要机器稍有一点毛病，工人就能立即判断出病根，随手拿起工具，紧紧螺丝，注注油，垫一垫……使机器迅速正常运转。工人们为了把“灭隐患”的维修方法巩固下去，建立了班前研究找对策，班后相互检查评比的制度，并把设备维护列为竞赛中的一项重要内容。
    生产工人和检修工人密切协作，是这个车间“灭隐患”活动的一个重要内容。检修工人在每台机器上建立了诊断记录，并且日夜分三班在机器边“安营扎寨”。生产工人则主动把机器运转情形告诉检修工人，互相研究，共谋对策。生产工人和检修工人还开展了对手赛。生产工人保证把隐患查清，检修工人保证检修又快又好。竞赛中既赛又帮。每次检修，他们都事先共同把备件、时间、人员安排妥当，检修一开始就齐帮对手，检修时间大大缩短。为了把不易发现的隐患“诊断”得更加准确，并及时消除，车间党总支书记挂帅，由生产老工人、检修老工人、技术人员和领导干部组成“四结合”的医疗队，经常深入到组，共同对设备进行全面会诊。
    鞍钢烧结总厂磁选车间提高设备作业率的经验，受到了兄弟单位的重视。东鞍山、大孤山、弓长岭和本溪南芬等选矿厂（车间），都曾派人前来参观学习。
