　　Xinhua News Agency, New York, 20th: The US government is using every dirty trick in the book to harass the Cuban delegation, led by Premier Castro, attending the 15th session of the United Nations General Assembly.
　　After Castro and the rest of the Cuban delegation arrived in New York on the 18th, they were immediately subjected to all sorts of harassment by the US authorities. When Castro and other members of the Cuban delegation were leaving the airport in cars, Castro once asked the driver to stop in a place so that he could get out of the car to greet a group of people welcoming the Cuban delegation. However, the American police, following orders from the US State Department and ostensibly there to "protect" Castro, actually interfered with Castro's actions, rudely shoving Castro back into the car, closing the doors tightly, and forcing the unwilling Cuban driver to drive away immediately.
　　After Castro arrived at his residence, the Shelburne Hotel, he was also subjected to all sorts of impolite treatment by the hotel authorities. The hotel owner not only unreasonably extorted a large deposit from Castro as so-called compensation for future "damage" to the hotel facilities by the Cuban delegation, but also deliberately insulted the Cuban delegation by flagrantly prohibiting them from entering the dining room.
　　Prior to this, the US State Department had formally notified the Cuban government that it would restrict the scope of activities of the Cuban delegation during its attendance at the UN General Assembly.
　　Castro expressed great anger at these deliberate acts of harassment by the United States. He said that in his brief stay in the United States, he felt a very uncomfortable "atmosphere of hostility," which was "the result of the US government's 'aggressive and provocative policies.'" He also met with United Nations Secretary-General Hammarskjöld on the 19th to protest the rude and disrespectful treatment by the United States.
　　After lodging a protest with Hammarskjöld, the Cuban delegation moved from the Shelburne Hotel to a black-owned hotel in the "Harlem" district of New York on the 19th. When Castro entered Harlem by car, large numbers of blacks cheered on the road to greet Castro, shouting: "Cuba yes, Yankees no!"

    美国政府用卑鄙手法百般刁难古巴代表团
　　卡斯特罗总理怒斥美国挑衅
　  大批美国黑人高呼“古巴行，美国佬不行！”口号向卡斯特罗致意
    新华社20日讯　纽约消息：美国政府百般刁难出席联合国大会第十五届会议的由卡斯特罗总理率领的古巴代表团。
    以卡斯特罗为首的古巴代表团在18日抵达纽约后，就立即遭到美国当局的种种刁难。当卡斯特罗和古巴代表团其他成员乘坐汽车离开机场时，卡斯特罗在一个地方曾经叫司机停车，以便走出汽车向一批欢迎古巴代表团的群众致意。但是奉美国国务院的命令以“保护”卡斯特罗为名随行的美国警察却居然干涉卡斯特罗的行动，粗暴地把卡斯特罗推进汽车内，并关紧车门，强迫不愿开车的古巴司机立即开走。
    卡斯特罗在抵达他的住所谢耳本旅馆后也遭到旅馆当局的种种无礼对待。旅馆主人不但无理地向卡斯特罗勒索大批押金，作为所谓古巴代表团以后对旅馆设备“有破坏”时的赔偿费，而且还蓄意侮辱古巴代表团，悍然禁止它们进入餐厅。
    在这以前，美国国务院曾正式通知古巴政府，要限制古巴代表团在出席联大会议期间的活动范围。
    卡斯特罗对美国这样一些蓄意的刁难表示很愤怒。他说，他在美国这样短暂的逗留就感到一种非常不舒服的“敌对的气氛”，这是美国政府的“侵略和挑衅政策的结果”。他并且在19日会见联合国秘书长哈马舍尔德，就美国的粗暴无礼对待提出抗议。
  在向哈马舍尔德提出抗议以后，古巴代表团已在19日从谢耳本旅馆搬往纽约黑人居住区“哈林姆区”一家黑人旅馆居住。卡斯特罗在乘车进入哈林姆时，大批黑人在路上欢呼向卡斯特罗致意，他们高呼：“古巴行，美国佬不行！”
