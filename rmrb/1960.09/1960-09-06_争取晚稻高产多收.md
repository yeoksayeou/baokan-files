The double-cropping late rice in the southern regions has been transplanted. This is the last batch of major grain crops this year. Striving for high yield and abundant harvest of late rice is the final and decisive battle for this year's grain production increase.

Double-cropping late rice accounts for a large proportion of summer-sown crops. According to statistics from thirteen provinces (regions) and cities in the south that grow more double-cropping rice, the area of double-cropping late rice accounted for 46.9% of the area of summer-sown grain crops last year, but the total output accounted for 57.1% of the total output of summer-sown grain crops. This shows that double-cropping late rice is a high-yield grain crop. Of course, the situation varies from place to place. The yield of double-cropping late rice in Guangdong Province has always been relatively high, but even in such areas, there is still great potential for increased production. The double-cropping late rice in Chaoyang County of this province increased by 25.7% in 1959 compared with 1958; the double-cropping late rice in Chaoan County increased by 23% in 1959 compared with 1958. These are two prominent examples. In the Yangtze River Basin, the yield of double-cropping late rice was generally not high in the past, generally lower than that of early rice. However, even in this region, many high-yield typical examples have emerged. For example, Liling County, Hunan, planted more than 410,000 mu of double-cropping late rice last year, with an average yield per mu 44% higher than that of early rice; Echeng County, Hubei, planted more than 130,000 mu of double-cropping late rice last year, with an average yield per mu exceeding early rice by 13.7%. In such areas, there is even greater potential for striving for a greater harvest of double-cropping late rice.

There were more cold waves in March and April this year, the early rice grew slowly and was harvested late, and the transplanting of late rice was delayed in many areas. According to past experience, the "cold dew wind" often occurs regularly in the Lingnan area in early October, and low temperatures often occur regularly in the Yangtze River Basin in late September. If the late rice is heading and flowering at this time, it will flower without fertilization, increasing the rate of unfilled grains. This situation should attract the attention of the vast number of cadres and the masses in the double-cropping late rice producing areas. However, past experience also tells us that as long as field management is strengthened, topdressing and weeding are carried out promptly, and fields are dried at the right time to promote early maturity, it is entirely possible to strive for high yields. According to the experiment of the Southwest Agricultural Science Research Institute, the "10509" and "Zhechang No. 3" late rice transplanted six days after the "Beginning of Autumn" achieved yields of 407 jin and 364 jin per mu, respectively, due to good field management. In some areas of Yichun Prefecture, Jiangxi, the late rice transplanted a few days after the "Beginning of Autumn" also reached a yield of about 400 jin per mu due to good management. There are many such examples in various places, which should be summarized and widely publicized to enhance people's confidence in striving for a bumper harvest of late rice.

At present, double-cropping late rice is turning green and tillering, which is the time to strengthen field management. In the early stage of late rice growth, it is still a high-temperature season. If management is good, it is not difficult to increase one tiller per plant. If calculated at 20,000 plants per mu, 20,000 more ears can be added. If each ear yields 50 grains, 40 to 50 jin of rice can be harvested per mu. However, the high-temperature season in the early stage of late rice growth is very short, so field management must be carried out as early as possible without any negligence.

The most important field management experiences for striving for a bumper harvest of double-cropping late rice in various places are: first, seize the time to topdress, mainly applying tillering fertilizer and panicle fertilizer; second, strengthen water and slurry management, dry the fields at the right time, and use irrigation water to regulate the temperature; third, establish the idea that man can conquer nature and overcome all natural disasters. At present, it is the time for double-cropping late rice to revive and tiller, so we must seize the time to topdress, cultivate, irrigate, dry the fields, and prevent disasters. As long as the later stage field management is done well, those who planted early, applied more fertilizer, and appropriately densely planted can naturally obtain higher yields; those who planted less originally can also strive for early tillering and more tillering; those who planted late originally can also strive to head and flower before the arrival of the cold wave. Among the various measures to increase production, the most important is to increase the application of topdressing fertilizer. This year, the area of late rice has expanded, and the demand for fertilizer has increased; however, due to the heavy task of drought resistance in the early stage in a few areas, there was no time to accumulate a large amount of fertilizer, and some late rice was transplanted in plain water. We must rely on the strength of the people's communes, vigorously implement the policy of large-scale breeding, large-scale planting, large-scale accumulation, and large-scale manufacturing of fertilizer, seize the current season when there are more green mountains, lakes, and grass, the temperature is high, there is more rain, and the fertilizer is easy to rot, seize the time, accumulate a large amount of fertilizer, and topdress a large amount of fertilizer to ensure high yield and abundant harvest of double-cropping late rice.

### 争取晚稻高产多收

    争取晚稻高产多收
    南方地区的双季晚稻已经插完。这是今年的最后一批主要粮食作物。争取晚稻高产多收，是争取今年粮食增产的一场最后的决定性战斗。
    双季晚稻在夏播作物中占有很大的比重。据南方种双季稻较多的十三个省（区）市计算，去年双季晚稻面积占夏播粮食作物面积的46.9％，总产量却占夏播粮食作物总产量的57.1％，可见双季晚稻是高产粮食作物。当然，各地情况是不同的。广东省双季晚稻产量历来较高，但就在这样的地区，仍然有很大的增产潜力。这个省的潮阳县的双季晚稻，1959年比1958年增产25.7％；潮安县的双季晚稻，1959年比1958年增产23％，就是两个突出的例子。在长江流域，过去双季晚稻产量一般不高，普遍低于早稻。可是，就在这个地区，也出现了不少高产的典型。例如，湖南醴陵县去年种了四十一万多亩双季晚稻，平均亩产比早稻高44％；湖北鄂城县去年种了十三万多亩双季晚稻，平均亩产超过早稻13.7％。在这样的地区，争取双季晚稻多收，具有更大的潜力。
    今年3、4月间寒潮较多，早稻生育迟，收割晚，不少地区晚稻插秧推迟了。根据历年来的经验，岭南地区10月上旬经常发生规律性的寒露风，长江流域9月下旬常有规律性的低温，如果晚稻正在这个时候抽穗开花，就会花而不孕，增多不实率。这个情况应该引起双季晚稻产区广大干部群众的注意。但是，历年的经验同时告诉我们：只要加强田间管理，抓紧追肥、中耕除草，适时晒田，促进早熟，争取高产还是完全可能的。据西南农业科学研究所试验，在“立秋”后六天插的“10509”和“浙场三号”晚稻，由于田间管理得好，分别取得了亩产四百零七斤和三百六十四斤的收成。江西宜春专区有些地区在“立秋”后几天栽的晚稻，由于管理得好，亩产也达到四百斤左右。这种例子各地很多，应该总结起来，大加宣传，增强人们争取晚稻丰收的信心。
    目前双季晚稻正在转青、分蘖，正是需要加强田间管理的时候。晚稻生长前期，还是高温季节，如果管理得好，每穴增多一个分蘖是不难的。如以每亩两万穴计算，就可以增加二万个穗，每穗以结实五十粒计，每亩可以多收四、五十斤稻谷。但是，晚稻生长前期的高温季节十分短促，所以必须及早进行田间管理，不容有丝毫疏忽。
    各地争取双季晚稻丰收的田间管理经验，最主要的有三条：第一是抓紧追肥，主要是施分蘖肥和攻穗肥。第二是加强水浆管理，适时晒田，利用灌溉水调剂温度。第三是确立人定胜天思想，战胜一切自然灾害。目前正是双季晚稻活棵、分蘖的时候，必须抓紧追肥、中耕、灌溉、晒田和防灾工作。只要后期田间管理作得好，原来插秧早、施肥多、适当密植的，固然可以获得更高的产量；原来插秧较少的，还可以争取早分蘖、多分蘖；原来插秧迟的，也可以提早在寒潮到来前抽穗扬花。在各种增产措施中，最重要的一条是增施追肥。今年晚稻面积扩大，需肥数量增多；但是少数地区由于前期抗旱任务较重，没有来得及大量积肥，有些晚稻是白水插秧的。我们一定要依靠人民公社的力量，大力贯彻大养大种大积大造的积肥方针，乘目前山青湖草较多，气温高、雨水多、肥料又容易腐熟的季节，抓紧时间，大量积肥，大量追肥，保证双季晚稻高产多收。
