　　Xinhua News Agency, New York, September 25th: U.S. Secretary of State Herter, in a speech to the New York Association of Foreign Correspondents on the 23rd, attacked Soviet Chairman of the Council of Ministers Khrushchev's speech and proposals at the United Nations General Assembly as a "full-scale attack on the United Nations."

　　Herter made these remarks at a luncheon of the Association of Foreign Correspondents held shortly after Khrushchev's speech at the UN General Assembly. He completely stood on the side of safeguarding the colonial system, saying that Khrushchev's proposal to end the colonial system was "inciting immediate rebellion in the remaining colonies."

　　Herter was obviously worried that Khrushchev's proposals to reorganize UN agencies would cause the U.S. to lose control of the UN—a tool that has long served U.S. interests—he insisted that Khrushchev's proposals were "a full-scale attack and a virtual declaration of war on the structure, personnel, and location of the United Nations." Herter also tried his best to defend America's loyal servant, UN Secretary-General Hammarskjöld, saying that "the Secretary-General is effectively, competently, and actively carrying out the work entrusted to him by the United Nations." Herter also described Hammarskjöld's active service to the U.S. plan to swallow up the Congo and his crude interference in the internal affairs of the Congo as a "job he has done very well" and expressed his "trust" and "gratitude" to him. Herter announced on the spot that in order to support Hammarskjöld’s continued activities in the Congo for the United States, he had given Hammarskjöld a check for five million dollars as the United States’ initial “contribution” to the so-called “United Nations Congo Fund” proposed by Hammarskjöld.

　　Herter also clamored that "all military assistance" to the Congo "should be handled through" the UN controlled by the United States. He threatened that otherwise, "more severe emergencies may occur."

　　Herter threatened that the United States was considering whether it might request the UN General Assembly to hold a vote of confidence in Hammarskjöld, but, fearing that this would backfire and cause Hammarskjöld to be ousted, he immediately said that according to the rules of the General Assembly, it was procedurally impossible to do so.

　　At the meeting, someone asked Herter about Khrushchev’s statement that the Soviet government was willing to do everything possible to improve relations between the Soviet Union and the United States, asking whether the door to restoring contact between the two countries was open.

　　Herter replied arrogantly: "Not necessarily." He said, "Since the so-called 'abortive' summit, I don't think the Soviet Union has made any great efforts to improve relations. In fact, I think most of the evidence proves that the Soviet Union is developing in another direction." He added, "If this remark (Khrushchev's) contains any specific meaning, of course we will study it very carefully."

　　Herter also maliciously attacked Ghanaian President Nkrumah's speech at the United Nations General Assembly. He said that Nkrumah's speech "seemed to be vying for leadership of a group of left-wing African countries." He believed that Nkrumah "is trying his best to proceed from such a perspective, that is, to appear to have a very close relationship with what Mr. Khrushchev said in his subsequent speech." "President Nkrumah seems to have regarded himself as a member of the Soviet bloc camp."

　　When talking about President Nkrumah’s proposal that the UN forces in the Congo should be entirely composed of troops from African countries, and that these troops should receive specific instructions to support a specific government, Herter said very uneasily, “This seems to be an attempt to take the leadership and command of the army now in the Congo completely from the hands of the Secretary-General, and take the leadership that now belongs to General Van Horn (a Swede, commander of the UN forces in the Congo)." He said, "This would be a very unfortunate thing."

　　When talking about Indian Prime Minister Nehru's upcoming visit to the United States and attendance at the United Nations General Assembly, Herter greatly praised Nehru. He said that the United States welcomes Nehru to come, "We (the United States) hope that Mr. Nehru can exert influence."

　　In answering reporters' questions, Herter also insisted on the U.S. government's hostile stance towards China, stating that the U.S. cold war policy of obstructing the restoration of China's legitimate seat in the United Nations remains unchanged.

### 赫脱攻击赫鲁晓夫和恩克鲁玛  叫嚷美国要继续控制联合国作侵略工具  表示改善苏美关系的大门“不一定”敞开

　　赫脱攻击赫鲁晓夫和恩克鲁玛
    叫嚷美国要继续控制联合国作侵略工具
    表示改善苏美关系的大门“不一定”敞开
    新华社25日讯　纽约消息：美国国务卿赫脱23日在纽约外国记者协会发表的讲话中，攻击苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫在联合国大会的讲话和提出的建议是“对联合国的全力的攻击”。
    赫脱是在赫鲁晓夫在联大会议上的发言结束后很快举行的外国记者协会午餐会上发表这番讲话的。他完全站在卫护殖民制度的立场上，说什么赫鲁晓夫关于结束殖民制度的建议是“煽动所余下的殖民地立即发动叛乱”。
    赫脱显然担心赫鲁晓夫关于改组联合国机构的建议会使美国失去对联合国——长期为美国利益服务的工具——的控制，他硬说赫鲁晓夫的这些建议“是对联合国结构、人员和地点的全力的攻击和真正的宣战”。赫脱还极力为美国的忠实奴仆、联合国秘书长哈马舍尔德辩护说，“秘书长正在有效地、能干地和积极地进行联合国委托给他的工作”。赫脱还把哈马舍尔德积极为美国鲸吞刚果的计划服务，粗暴地干涉刚果内政的活动说成是他“完成得非常出色的一项工作”，并对他表示“信任”和“感激”。赫脱当场宣布，为了支持哈马舍尔德继续在刚果为美国效劳的活动，他已交给哈马舍尔德五百万美元的支票，作为美国对哈马舍尔德建议成立的所谓“联合国刚果基金”的初步“捐助”。
    赫脱还叫嚷给予刚果的“一切军事援助”都“应当通过”美国控制的联合国来处理，他恫吓说，否则“就可能发生更加剧烈的紧急情况”。
    赫脱扬言美国在考虑是否可能要求联合国大会对哈马舍尔德举行一次信任投票，但是，由于担心这样反会弄巧成拙，从而使哈马舍尔德被赶下台，他马上又说，根据大会的规则，这样作在程序上是行不通的。
    会上有人就赫鲁晓夫所说苏联政府愿意尽一切力量来改善苏联和美国之间的关系一节向赫脱提出问题，问他两国恢复接触的大门是否敞开着。
    赫脱傲然回答说：“不一定”。他说，“自从所谓‘流产的’最高级会议以来，我并不觉得，苏联曾经作出过任何巨大的努力来改善关系。事实上，我认为大部分证据都证明苏联是在朝另外一个方向发展。”他又说，“如果（赫鲁晓夫）这番话是包含什么具体的含义的，当然我们将非常仔细地加以研究。”
    赫脱还恶毒攻击加纳总统恩克鲁玛在联合国大会上的演说。他说，在他听来恩克鲁玛总统的演说“好像在争取一批左翼的非洲国家的领导权”。他认为，恩克鲁玛“是竭力从这样一个角度出发，就是要显得同赫鲁晓夫先生在他接着发表的演说中所说的话有着非常密切的关系”，“恩克鲁玛总统看来已经把自己当做苏联集团阵营中的人”。
    在谈到恩克鲁玛总统提出的在刚果的联合国部队应该完全由非洲国家的部队组成，以及这支部队应该受到具体的指示来支持一个特定的政府的主张时，赫脱十分不安地说，“这似乎是想要把对现在在刚果的军队的领导和指挥权完全从秘书长的手中拿过来，并把现在属于范霍恩将军（瑞典人，在刚果的联合国部队司令）的领导权拿过来”。他说，“这将是一件非常不幸的事情”。
    赫脱在谈到印度总理尼赫鲁即将前往美国和出席联合国大会一事时，对尼赫鲁大加赞扬。他说，美国欢迎尼赫鲁来，“我们（美国）会希望尼赫鲁先生能够发挥影响”。
    赫脱在答记者问中还坚持美国政府敌视中国的立场，表示美国阻挠恢复中国在联合国中的合法席位的冷战政策仍然保持不变。
