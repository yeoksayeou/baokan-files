    Grasp High-Yield Plots with One Hand, Low-Yield Fields with the Other
    Xuzhou Prefecture's "Three Wheats" Planting Preparations are Solid and Comprehensive
    Chunyu Brigade in Yexian County Arranges Crop Rotations, Calculates Labor Force, and Prepares for Wheat Planting in an Orderly Manner
    According to Xinhua News Agency reports, in the autumn planting season, Xuzhou Prefecture, Jiangsu Province, is grasping high-yield plots with one hand and low-yield fields with the other, to ensure a comprehensive increase in production in the next summer harvest.
    The Xuzhou Plain is one of the main wheat-producing areas in Jiangsu Province. The planting area and yield of "three wheats" (spring wheat, winter wheat, and barley) have historically accounted for a large proportion in this region.
    The Xuzhou Prefectural Committee of the Communist Party of China and Party committees at all levels, through mobilizing the masses, have earnestly summarized the experiences and lessons of high wheat yields over the years, arriving at an important conclusion: grasp high-yield plots with one hand, and low-yield fields with the other. Countless facts have proven that vigorously developing high-yield plots can not only obtain higher yields on less land but also promote the production of large fields. Last year, Pixian County established 100,000 mu of high-yield plots in the northern region, with contiguous planting and uniform standards. Using these high-yield plots as models to promote large-field management, the county's average yield became the highest in the entire district. This year, during the autumn planting season, various localities are carrying out a mass movement of "ten-thousand-mu by the commune, thousand-mu by the brigade, and hundred-mu (or tens of mu) by the production team" for high-yield plots. The area of high-yield plots generally reaches more than 30% of the autumn planting area.
    While vigorously developing high-yield fields, the entire district is also focusing on low-yield fields. According to surveys in various localities, low-yield fields account for about 20% of the planting area in the entire district. Why are low-yield fields low-yielding? The main reasons are late crop rotations, poor soil, and extensive cultivation. To address these reasons, various localities are taking four measures to resolutely eliminate low-yield fields before planting. These measures are: 1. Late crop rotations must not result in late planting or reduced yields. Late crop rotations are mainly due to the large sweet potato area. To solve the contradiction between harvesting and planting, various localities are taking three measures: first, appropriately advancing the harvest of spring sweet potatoes to clear the fields earlier, ensuring that late crop rotations do not result in late planting; second, changing crop varieties. The entire district plans to change to planting large-kernel wheat on 2.5 million mu; third, completing any farm work that can be done earlier as early as possible. 2. Distant and poor land will not lack fertilizer. Under the slogan of promoting increased grain production with fertilizer, various localities are vigorously carrying out fertilizer accumulation campaigns, increasing the application of base fertilizer, and planting green manure crops extensively in distant and poor land, establishing field-side ponds, and focusing on topdressing with chemical fertilizer. 3. Based on the characteristics of this year's heavy autumn rains and high groundwater levels, various localities are generally digging ditches to lower the groundwater level, ensuring that low-lying areas are not flooded and that planting is done at the appropriate time. 4. In areas with sparse population and vast land, youth expeditionary forces are being organized to establish high-yield plots and launch a mass movement to transform low-yield fields.
    To ensure the implementation of the above measures, Party committees at all levels are concentrating 80% of their leading cadres, 80% of Party members and Communist Youth League members, and 80% of the labor force on the front line of production, focusing on autumn plowing and planting preparations while also ensuring a good autumn harvest. Three of the five secretaries of the Prefectural Committee have gone deep into the front line, and the Prefectural and County level offices have also transferred more than 3,000 cadres to the grassroots level to serve as deputy positions, strengthening leadership.
    According to Xinhua News Agency reports, the Chunyu Brigade of Pinglidian Commune in Yexian County, Shandong Province, is arranging crop rotations, allocating labor, calculating tasks, and estimating time, moving farm work forward as much as possible. This effectively solves the contradiction of large autumn harvest and planting tasks with a tight labor force, and quickly implements the work of contracting for work, contracting for output, and contracting for costs to production teams, making wheat planting preparations in an orderly manner.
    Because of the large autumn planting area and many late-rotation fields, the Chunyu Brigade is advancing farm work in three ways to solve the problem of concentrated farm work: accumulate sufficient fertilizer in advance and transport it all to the fields before the White Dew solar term; arrange crop rotations to turn late-rotation into early-rotation; and heavily irrigate the soil for moisture retention during the yellow ripening period of corn to preserve moisture for autumn planting. By September 3, the entire brigade had transported 80% of the autumn planting base fertilizer to the fields. This alone is equivalent to increasing the team's labor force by more than 3,000 workdays during autumn planting (calculated at one workday saved per mu).
    In terms of crop rotation, the period from the White Dew to the Autumn Equinox solar term is the one with the fewest rotations in this brigade, with only 330 mu for the entire brigade, while the period from the Autumn Equinox to the Cold Dew solar term is very tense due to the concentration of harvesting and planting. Through arranging crop rotations, it was determined that some late rotations could be turned into early rotations, with 1,280 mu planted before the Autumn Equinox. For example, the 250 mu of vegetable land and 80 mu of sweet potato land, which were originally late rotations, can be turned into early rotations by using intercropping methods.
    Heavily irrigating the soil for moisture retention during the yellow ripening period of corn not only promotes full corn kernels and increased yields, but more importantly, it preserves moisture for autumn planting and speeds up the progress of autumn harvest (saving labor during harvest due to the moist ground). The entire brigade plans to irrigate 1,200 mu with mechanized wells, which has already begun.
    To ensure that farm work is moved forward, the brigade has also made arrangements for labor and tools. Under the guidance of the idea that grain is the foundation of the foundation, the brigade appropriately arranged the labor force in water conservancy, animal husbandry, culture, and welfare, and diverted 69 workers from these areas to strengthen field production. The brigade's rubber-tired carts, large carts, and other transportation tools, as well as planting tools, have all been properly repaired and assigned to production teams for use. At the same time, the brigade has been focusing on tool innovation and has achieved great success. Ten single-wheel handcarts have been converted into two-wheeled carts for both human and animal traction, increasing work efficiency by more than 100%. Sixteen discs for five-row seed drills have been manufactured. This autumn, the brigade is widely using ten-row and six-row seed drills and five-row seed drills, which not only saves a lot of labor but also ensures planting quality.
    At present, the Chunyu Brigade's autumn planting "three contracting" work has been implemented to the production teams. Through discussion, the broad masses of commune members have great confidence and are full of energy. Each production team is formulating short-term plans based on the "three contracting" system.

    一手抓丰产方  一手抓低产田
    徐州专区“三麦”播种准备工作既扎实又全面
    掖县淳于大队排茬口算劳力种麦准备井井有条
    据新华社讯　江苏徐州专区在秋播中，一手抓丰产方，一手抓低产田，以保证明年夏收全面增产。
    徐州平原是江苏省的主要产麦区之一。这个地区历年来三麦的播种面积和产量都占很大比重。
    中共徐州地委和各级党委通过发动群众，认真总结历年来三麦丰产的经验教训，得出一条重要的结论，就是一手抓丰产方，一手抓低产田。无数的事实证明：大搞丰产方，它不仅可以在较少的土地上得到更多的产量，而且可以推动大田的生产。邳县去年在北部地区建立了十万亩的丰产方，连片种植，规格一样，他们以丰产方为样板，推动大田管理，使全县平均单产创全区冠军。今年各地在秋播中，开展了公社搞万亩、大队搞千亩、生产队搞百亩（或几十亩）的“万千百十”丰产方群众运动。丰产方的面积一般都达到秋播面积的30％以上。
    全区在大搞丰产田的同时，还大抓低产田。据各地排队，全区低产田占播种面积的20％左右。低产田为什么低产？主要是：茬口晚，土地瘦，耕作粗放。针对这些原因，各地采取四条措施，坚决在播种前消灭低产田。这些措施是：一、晚茬不晚种，不少收。茬口晚主要是山芋面积大。为了解决收种矛盾，各地采取三个办法：一是适当提前收获春山芋，早收早腾茬，做到晚茬不晚种；二是调换作物品种。全区计划改种大元麦二百五十万亩；三是把能提前的农活，尽量提前干完。二、远地、瘦地不缺肥。各地在以肥料保证粮食增产的口号推动下，大搞积肥运动，增施了基肥，同时在远地瘦地大量种植了绿肥，建立田头塘，并重点追施化肥。三、根据今年秋雨多，地下水位高的特点，各地普遍开沟降低地下水位，保证洼地不受涝，适时播种。四、对地广人稀的地方，组织青年远征军，建立丰产方，掀起改造低产田的群众运动。
    为了保证实现上述措施，各级党委正集中80％的领导骨干、80％的党团员、80％的劳动力到生产第一线，在抓好秋收的同时，狠抓秋耕和秋种准备工作。地委的五个书记有三位深入第一线，地县两级机关还先后抽调三千多名干部到基层担任副职，加强领导。
    据新华社讯　山东省掖县平里店公社淳于大队排茬口、排劳力、算任务、算时间，把农活尽量向前赶，有效地解决了秋收秋种任务大、劳力紧的矛盾，使包工、包产、包成本工作很快落实到生产小队，种麦的准备工作做得井井有条。
    由于秋种面积大、晚茬地多，淳于大队从三方面把农活向前赶，解决了农活集中的问题，即：提前积足肥料，并在白露前全部运到地头；安排茬口，变晚茬为早茬；玉米黄熟期大浇底墒水，为秋种保墒。到9月3日，全队已把80％的秋种底肥运到地头。仅这一项，全队等于秋播时增加了三千多个工日（按每亩节约一个工日计）。
    在茬口方面，这个队从白露到秋分这一段的茬口最少，全大队只有三百三十亩，而秋分到寒露这一段收、种集中，非常紧张。通过排茬口，研究出有些晚茬可以变为早茬，在秋分前种上一千二百八十亩。如二百五十亩蔬菜地和八十亩甘薯地本来也是晚茬，可以用套种的办法变为早茬。
    在玉米黄熟期大浇底墒水，不仅促使玉米籽粒饱满，增加产量，而更重要的是为秋种保了墒，加快了秋收（地湿收时省工）进度。全队计划用机井浇一千二百亩，现在已经开始。
    为了保证农活向前赶，这个大队对劳力、工具也作了安排。大队在粮食是基础的基础的思想指导下，适当安排了水利、饲养、文化、福利等方面的劳力，从中匀出六十九个劳力来加强了田间生产。全大队的胶轮车、大车等运输工具和播种工具，也都修理妥善，固定到小队使用。同时，大队还抓紧了工具改革，并且取得了很大成绩。十辆单轮人推车改为两轮人、畜两用拉车，工效提高一倍以上。五行播种耧已制成十六盘。今秋这个大队普遍采用十行、六行播种机和五行播种耧，不仅可以节约大量劳力，而且可以保证播种质量。
    目前，淳于大队秋种“三包”工作已落实到生产小队。广大社员通过讨论，信心很大，干劲很足。各生产小队正在根据“三包”制定小段计划。（附图片）
