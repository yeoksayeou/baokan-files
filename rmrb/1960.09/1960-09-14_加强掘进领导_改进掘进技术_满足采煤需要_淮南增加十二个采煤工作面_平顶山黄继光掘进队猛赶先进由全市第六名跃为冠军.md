Xinhua News Agency, Hefei Telegram: While vigorously grasping high coal production, the Huainan Coal Mine is mobilizing the masses to concentrate efforts on strengthening tunneling, further accelerating the tunneling speed. In the second half of August, the average daily footage of tunneling in the entire mine increased by 7.9% compared with the first half of August; since entering September, the average daily footage has increased by another 4% compared with the second half of August. Recently, twelve new coal mining faces have been added to the entire mine.

The coal production of Huainan Coal Mine from January to August this year has greatly increased compared with the same period last year. In order to continue increasing production, it is required to further accelerate the tunneling speed and provide more extractable coal volume. In order to strengthen the leadership of tunneling work, Kang Zhijie, Secretary of the Secretariat of the CPC Huainan Municipal Committee and Director of the Mining Bureau, personally took charge of the tunneling work. Each mine also established a tunneling leading group headed by the party committee secretary, and designated a mine director and an engineer to be specifically responsible for tunneling. At the same time, a group of cadres were assigned to strengthen the leadership of grassroots tunneling organizations. The Mining Bureau has also established a daily reporting system. Each mine also implements daily plans and shift plans to teams, groups, and individuals, ensuring that plans are made and measures are formulated before each shift, and the completion is checked after each shift to ensure that the tunneling footage plan is completed on a shift-by-shift and day-by-day basis. The Xinzhuangzi Mine concentrated eleven excellent rapid tunneling teams to accelerate the development of six new coal mining faces and the main roadway project in four districts. These tunneling teams used advanced tunneling tools such as rock electric drills and tunneling combines, which greatly accelerated the tunneling speed. Five new coal mining faces are about to be fully developed. The Jiulonggang Mine uses more than 360 tunneling workers in a tunneling area to specialize in the development of new mining areas. In the first and middle ten days of August, they developed five new coal mining faces, and are currently developing another six new coal mining faces.

This coal mine also vigorously mobilized the masses to carry out a tunneling technology reform campaign centered on promoting rapid tunneling methods, and widely adopted new technologies. The third tunneling team of Xinzhuangzi Mine adopted advanced experience such as "deep hole large cycle" and "shallow advance multiple cycle" according to the characteristics of different coal seams, so that the average daily footage in August was improved compared with July. After Xinzhuangzi Mine comprehensively promoted the rapid tunneling experience of this team, the average daily progress of tunneling faces in the entire mine increased by 10% compared with July, and the daily footage of the main roadway increased sharply by 43%. Tunneling workers in Xiesan Mine carried out technical reforms around the weak link of loading and unloading operations, and successfully used iron dustpans, small baskets, and square-headed shovels to load trucks, which greatly improved loading and unloading efficiency and accelerated the tunneling speed.

According to Pingdingshan Daily: The Huang Jiguang Youth Rapid Tunneling Team of Zhugemiao Coal Mine in Pingdingshan City, Henan Province, completed the monthly plan three days ahead of schedule in August, with a monthly footage of 701.15 meters, a sharp increase of 66.5% compared with July, and an increase in work efficiency of more than 50%. The team's ranking among the city's rapid tunneling teams jumped from sixth place at the beginning of the month to first place. Since entering September, the team has been achieving daily success. From the 1st to the 6th, the team achieved a total footage of 124.55 meters, still maintaining the honor of being the first in the city.

Encouraged by the slogan "Learn from Qihezhi, Catch Up with Qihezhi," all members of the team resolutely established the ambition to catch up with the advanced. At the tunneling meeting held by Pingdingshan Mining Bureau in early August, they challenged the then most advanced tunneling team in the city, the Changsheng Youth Tunneling Team of Haotang Mine, and determined to surpass the Changsheng team. At that time, their production level was far behind the Changsheng team. But the team members were not discouraged. They meticulously searched for reasons, thought of ways, and formulated measures to catch up by all means. They found that among the four groups in the team, the Jiang Kuizheng group had less footage in the first ten days of August, so they held a discussion to study the problem and finally found loopholes such as starting work late in the morning shift, being slack in the first half of the shift, and being tight in the second half of the shift. Therefore, they proposed the slogan "Grasp the first half of the shift firmly, everyone strives to take the initiative." As a result, the shift footage of this group quickly increased from three to four meters to five to six meters, while also achieving a balance between work and rest.

Catching up with the advanced requires drive and diligence. The team members vigorously promoted advanced experience and boldly improved operating methods. In addition to actively learning from the advanced experience of the Qihezhi team, such as using double electric drills to drill holes and double blasting rods to load explosives, they also creatively changed the method of loading explosives in stages, blasting in stages, and excavating the groove in stages into one-time drilling, loading explosives, and blasting, so that the time for each cycle was shortened from one to two hours to half an hour, with the shortest being twenty minutes. They carried forward the spirit of daring to think and act and self-reliance, and adopted both indigenous and foreign methods to carry out dry excavation and water transportation on a large scale. From the 1st to the 5th, the average daily footage rose from sixth place in the city to third place. In order to better motivate the team members, the team leaders discussed the daily dispatch reports issued by the Mining Bureau with the masses every day, and announced the footage of each rapid tunneling team in the city, calculating and catching up at all times. On August 27th, they finally surpassed the 51st team of Leigutai Mine and jumped to second place in the city. After the 27th, they entered the most tense stage of striving for the top in the whole month. They mustered greater enthusiasm to accelerate the tunneling speed, and used the phone to understand the footage situation of the Changsheng team on a day-by-day and shift-by-shift basis. On the 29th, the party committee secretary and the mine director presided over a meeting of the main cadres of this team, further taking active measures to continue to improve the daily footage. The entire month finally exceeded the Changsheng team with the outstanding achievement of 701.15 meters of footage, winning the first place in the city.

    加强掘进领导　改进掘进技术　满足采煤需要
    淮南增加十二个采煤工作面
    平顶山黄继光掘进队猛赶先进由全市第六名跃为冠军
    新华社合肥电　淮南煤矿在大抓采煤高产的同时，正发动群众集中力量加强掘进，进一步加快了掘进速度。8月下半月全矿掘进平均日进尺，比8月上半月提高7.9％；进入9月以来，平均日进尺又比8月下半月提高4％。最近以来，全矿新增加了十二个新采煤工作面。
    淮南煤矿今年1至8月份的产煤量比去年同期有很大提高，为了继续增产，要求进一步加快掘进速度，提供更多的可采煤量。为了加强对掘进工作的领导，中共淮南市委书记处书记兼矿务局局长康志杰亲自抓掘进工作，各个矿也都以党委书记为首成立了掘进领导小组，并且指定矿长、工程师各一名专门负责抓掘进，同时下放一批干部充实基层掘进组织的领导。矿务局还建立了一日一汇报的制度，各个矿场也都将日计划、班计划落实到班、组和个人，做到班前做计划、订措施，班后检查完成情况，保证按班、按日完成掘进尺计划。新庄孜矿集中了十一个优秀的快速掘进队，加速开拓六个新采煤工作面和四个区的主巷工程。这些掘进队采用了岩石电钻、掘进康拜因等先进掘进工具，大大加快了掘进速度，有五个新采煤工作面即将全部开拓出来。九龙岗矿以一个掘进区的三百六十多个掘进工人专门开拓新采区，他们在8月上、中旬就开拓了五个新采煤工作面，目前正在开拓另外六个新采煤工作面。
    这个煤矿还大力发动群众，开展以推广快速掘进法为中心的掘进技术改革运动，广泛采用新技术。新庄孜矿掘进三队根据不同煤层的特点，采用了“深打眼大循环”和“浅进多循环”等先进经验，使8月份的平均日进尺比7月份提高。新庄孜矿全面推广这个队的快速掘进经验以后，全矿掘进工作面平均日进度比7月份提高10％，主巷日进尺猛增43％。谢三矿掘进工人围绕扒装作业的薄弱环节进行技术改革，利用铁簸箕、小筐、方头铲子装车成功，大大提高了扒装效率，加快了掘进速度。
    本报讯　据平顶山日报消息：河南省平顶山市诸葛庙煤矿黄继光青年快速掘进队，8月份提前三天完成了月计划，月进尺七百零一点一五米，比7月份进尺猛增66.5％，工效提高50％多，在全市快速掘进队中的名次由月初的第六位跃到了第一位。进入9月份以来还是日日红，1至6日共进尺一百二十四点五五米，仍保持了全市第一名的荣誉。
    这个队的全体队员在“学齐合只，赶齐合只”的口号鼓舞下，坚决树立了赶先进的雄心壮志。8月初，在平顶山矿务局召开的掘进会议上，向全市当时最先进的掘进队——郝堂矿长胜青年掘进队提出了挑战，决心赶过长胜队。当时他们的生产水平比长胜队差得很远。但队员们并不灰心，细致找原因，想办法，订措施，千方百计赶上去。他们发现在全队四个小组中，姜魁正小组在8月上旬进尺比较少，就开座谈会研究，终于找出了上班早，开工晚，前半班松、后半班紧的漏洞。于是提出：“狠抓前半班，人人争主动”的口号，结果这个组班进尺由三至四米很快升到了五至六米，同时作到了有劳有逸。
    赶先进需要干劲加钻劲，队员们大力推广先进经验，大胆改进操作方法。除了积极学习齐合只队的双电钻打眼、双炮棍装药等先进经验外，还创造性地把分次装药、分次放炮、分次掏槽刷帮改为一次打眼、装药、放炮，使每循环的时间由以前的一至二小时缩短到半小时，最短达到二十分钟。他们发扬敢想敢干、自力更生的精神，采取土洋并举的办法，大搞旱掘水运。1至5日平均日进尺，就由全市第六位上升到第三位。为了更好地激励队员们的干劲，队领导天天把矿务局发的调度日报拿到群众中讨论，公布全市各快速掘进队的进尺数，时时算，天天赶，到8月27日终于超过了擂鼓台矿五十一队，跃到了全市第二位。27日以后进入了全月争上游的最紧张阶段，他们鼓足更大干劲，加快掘进速度，并且按天按班用电话了解长胜队的进尺情况。29日矿党委书记和矿长主持召开了这个队的主要干部会议，进一步采取积极措施，使日进尺继续提高，全月终于以进尺七百零一点一五米的优异成绩超过了长胜队，争得了全市第一。
