American Black People Cannot Tolerate Racial Discrimination in Schools

    Sit-in Demonstrations Outside School Gates

    On the morning of September 12th, at sixty-eight public schools in the Brooklyn district of New York City, large numbers of angry people were sitting outside each school gate.

    Who were they? And why were they sitting outside the school gates so early in the morning?

    It turned out that they were Black students and parents from various schools in New York City. To protest the authorities' insistence on implementing racial discrimination policies in schools and to fight for equal rights to education, they began sit-in demonstrations outside the school gates from that day on.

        Discrimination Against Black Students

    In the United States, the working people are subjected to the cruel exploitation and oppression of monopoly capital, and the suffering of Black people is even more profound. Black students in the United States face serious discrimination. Especially in the seventeen southern states and the District of Columbia, Black people are not allowed to enter white schools. And there are very few Black schools, and the conditions are very poor. For example, in Mississippi, the expenditure on students in Black schools is only about one-quarter of that in white schools. The average salary of teachers is also less than half that of teachers in white schools. In the Lothar district of Chicago, there are vacancies in various white schools this semester, but many Black children nearby are out of school.

      "Judgments" with No Effect

    The broad masses of Black people in the United States have waged a long-term struggle against racial segregation in schools. This just struggle has been supported by the American working people and progressive individuals. Under the pressure of public opinion, the U.S. Supreme Court was forced to acknowledge in May 1954 that separate schools for whites and people of color were unconstitutional and stipulated that integration should be gradually implemented. But in reality, the U.S. ruling group is still doing everything possible to insist on racial discrimination in schools, using various tricks to obstruct the realization of Black and white integration in schools. The "Little Rock" incident is the most famous example of this.

    In many other areas, racialists, under the pretext of so-called "deliberate speed," have been doing their utmost to delay Black and white integration. Last year, in the five states of Virginia, North Carolina, Tennessee, Arkansas, and Florida, only nine hundred and sixteen Black students entered white schools. At this rate, it would take these five states thirteen thousand five hundred years to fully realize Black and white integration.

        New Tricks in the New School Year

    This year, in the new school year starting in September, racialists have played some new tricks on the issue of Black and white integration.

    In some areas, racialists have adopted tough tactics. For example, in the five states of South Carolina, Alabama, Mississippi, and Georgia, not a single Black child can enter a white school. In Louisiana, Governor Davis ordered all public white schools not to admit Black children, and if anyone violated the order, the school would be closed. In Houston, the capital of Texas, which has opposed Black and white integration for three years, the mayor decided to rather suspend all schools in the city for a year, causing all schoolchildren to be out of school, than to allow Black and white integration.

    In some other southern states, racialists have adopted the deceptive tactic of so-called "symbolic" integration. Virginia approved only forty Black children to enter white schools this school year, and white schools in Arkansas are estimated to admit one hundred Black students.

        The Struggle of the Black Masses

    Of course, the various deceptive tactics of the racialists cannot deceive the broad masses of Black people. The New York City Board of Education, under the pressure of the Black people's struggle and public opinion, announced a change in its "no compromise policy" and implemented a so-called "voluntary transfer" measure. However, the deceptive nature of this measure is obvious because, first, it only allows a small number of Black students to enter white secondary schools; second, it does not allow Black elementary school students to enter white elementary schools at all this year. And as everyone knows, elementary school students account for the vast majority of Black students.

    Black parents in New York City firmly oppose the educational authorities' racial discrimination measures. They have united and formed the Citywide Association of Black Student Parents for Equal Educational Opportunities and are conducting sit-in demonstrations. They are also preparing to hold large-scale rallies and demonstrations. They not only want to fight for Black and white integration in schools but also demand that Black schools be equal to white schools in terms of equipment and various conditions, and strive for the complete elimination of racial discrimination.

    The measures taken by various states in the United States to persist in racial discrimination in school education thoroughly expose the hypocrisy of the so-called American "freedom" and "equality" touted by imperialist propagandists.

### 美国黑人不能容忍学校种族歧视

　　美国黑人不能容忍学校种族歧视
    校门外的静坐示威
    9月12日早上，在美国纽约市布鲁克宁区的六十八所公立学校，每所学校的门外都坐着大批愤怒的人们。
    他们是什么人？为什么大清早就坐在学校门外？
    原来，他们是纽约市各学校的黑人学生和家长。为了抗议当局坚持在学校中实行种族歧视政策，为了争取受教育的平等权利，他们从这天起开始进行校门外的静坐示威斗争。
        对黑人学生的歧视
    在美国，劳动人民受到垄断资本的残酷剥削和压迫，其中黑人遭受的更加深重。黑人学生在美国受到严重的歧视。特别在美国南部十七个州和哥伦比亚区，黑人不许进白人的学校。而黑人学校数量很少，条件很差。例如在密士西必州，黑人学校为学生所花的经费只及白人学校的四分之一左右。教员平均工资还不到白人学校教师的一半。在芝加哥市的罗塔尔区，本学期各白人学校都有空额，但附近许多黑人儿童却失学。
      没有效果的“判决”
    美国广大黑人为反对学校的种族隔离进行了长期的斗争。这一正义斗争得到美国劳动人民和进步人士的支持。在舆论的压力下，美国最高法院被迫于1954年5月承认白人与有色人分校是违背宪法，并规定要逐步实行合校。但实际上，美国统治集团仍然千方百计坚持学校中的种族歧视，用各种花样阻挠黑、白人合校的实现。“小石城”事件，就是其中最著名的例子。
    在其它不少地区，种族主义者在所谓“审慎的速度”借口下，竭力拖延黑、白人合校。去年，在弗吉尼亚、北加利福尼亚、田纳西、阿肯色和佛罗里达五个州中，只有九百一十六个黑人学生进入白人学校。按照这种速度，这五个州要到一万三千五百年以后才能完全实现黑、白人合校。
        新学年中的新把戏
    今年，在从9月开始的新学年内，种族主义者对黑人、白人的合校问题又耍出了一些新的把戏。
    在有些地区，种族主义者采取了强硬的手法。如南加利福尼亚、亚拉巴马、密士西必和佐治亚五个州中，没有一个黑人儿童能进白人学校。在路易斯安那州，州长戴维斯下令各公立白人学校一律不吸收黑人儿童，如果有人违犯命令，就将这所学校关闭。在已经反对黑白合校三年的德克萨斯州首府郝斯顿，市长决定宁愿将全市学校停办一年，叫全部学童失学，也不黑白合校。
    在南部其他一些州内，种族主义者采取了所谓“象征性”合校的欺骗手法，弗吉尼亚州本学年只批准四十名黑人儿童进白人学校，阿肯色州的白人学校估计将吸收一百名黑人学生。
        黑人群众的斗争
    当然，种族主义者的各种欺骗手法，是不能蒙蔽广大黑人群众的。纽约市的教育局迫于黑人的斗争和舆论的压力，宣布改变它的“不妥协政策”，实行一项所谓“志愿转学”措施，但是这项措施的欺骗性是显而易见的，因为第一，它只允许少数黑人学生升入白人中学；第二，今年根本不让黑人小学生进入白人小学。而大家知道，小学生占黑人学生的绝大多数。
    纽约市的黑人学生家长坚决反对教育当局的种族歧视措施，他们团结起来，组成了全市黑人学生家长争取教育平等协会，进行了静坐示威斗争。他们还准备举行大规模的集会和示威游行。他们不仅要争取黑、白人合校，还要求使黑人学校在设备和各项条件上同白人学校平等，争取彻底消灭种族歧视。
    美国各州在学校教育方面坚持种族歧视的措施，彻底暴露了帝国主义宣传家吹嘘的所谓美国“自由”、“平等”的虚伪性。
