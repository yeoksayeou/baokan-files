    Blocking the Canal Breach	Fan Fang, Director of the China Peking Opera Theater

    The automatic waterwheel rotates ceaselessly. Clear stream water slowly climbs up the riverbank, flowing along the canal and into the furrows.

    From the construction of the automatic waterwheel, building the dam, and digging the canal to today's irrigation, I have participated in everything. Now, watching the gurgling water, flowing past my feet and into the fields, nourishing the seedlings, I feel particularly happy.

    Watching the canal breach seems to be an easy task. Like a sentry, I carried a shovel and walked along the canal bank. Looking at my small shadow reflected on the water's surface, swaying with the ripples as it moves forward, I can't help but hum a song, feeling relaxed and content.

    Suddenly, a fountain of water burst out from a corner of the canal, there was a hole in the canal bank, and the water flowed straight to the edge of the field. I hurried over to shovel earth to repair the leak, but even after a dozen shovelfuls of earth, I couldn't stop it. The water flow was so rapid that, in the blink of an eye, the trickle turned into a torrent, the hole was washed into a deep gully, and the canal bank began to collapse. Sweat dripped from my head, and I felt somewhat flustered. The water from the breach continued to pour out of the canal, gurgling as if mocking me.

    "What's wrong?" Just as I was at a loss, Grandpa Qiao Xi came running from afar, carrying a shovel.

    "There's a leak!" I shouted anxiously, fully expecting him to rush over and help me shovel earth to repair the breach. Unexpectedly, Grandpa Qiao Xi stopped on the other side of the canal bank, laughing at my embarrassed appearance.

    "Grandpa, come over and block it!" I was really getting impatient with his calmness.

    "Don't panic!" he said, as he bent down and shoveled a few spadefuls of earth from his feet, piling it up in the canal to cut off the water supply from upstream. The torrent from the breach immediately stopped, and I suddenly understood…

    Grandpa Qiao Xi came over to help me repair the canal breach, tamped down the newly piled earth on the canal bank, and then went back to clear the water source upstream, everything was so orderly and smooth.

    I wiped the sweat from my body. Grandpa Qiao Xi packed a bag of tobacco, looked at me and smiled again: "Silly fellow, if you don't cut off the water flow, how can you block the leak by only patching it?"

    Yes! This is a simple and easy-to-understand principle! But it is this simple and easy-to-understand principle that I don't know how to apply to solve practical problems. I only care about rushing around to fix the immediate leak, and I haven't even considered cutting off the source to cure the root cause. Thinking about it, when dealing with other things, isn't it sometimes the same, not knowing how to apply this simple principle? But Grandpa Qiao Xi understands it very clearly and knows how to apply it.

    The sun shines over the fields, and the canal water glistens. As I thought about this principle, I walked along the canal, a small, ridiculous shadow floating on the water surface again, this is the shadow of an intellectual.

    堵渠口	中国京剧院导演　樊放
    自动水车不停地旋转。清澈的溪水缓缓爬上河坡，沿着渠道注入垅沟。
    从修建自动水车、垒坝、筑渠到今天引水灌田，我一直是参加了的。如今看着潺潺的流水，经由自己脚下注入田畦，浸润着禾苗，心里感到分外愉快。
    看管渠口，似乎是个轻闲的活计。我像哨兵一样，扛了锨，沿着渠岗走着。看着自己扁小的身影，倒映水面，顺着微波，摇曳地向前移动，我不禁哼着歌曲，悠然自得。
    忽然，渠道拐角涌出一股喷泉，渠岗上有了漏洞，水流直泄田边。我急忙赶上去铲土补漏，一连十几锨土，竟然堵截不住，水流竟会那样湍急，转眼间，细水变成洪流，漏洞冲成深沟，渠岗开始坍陷。我头上淌下汗来，有些手忙脚乱。决了口的水流，继续泻出渠道，哗哗地响着，简直是在对我嘲笑。
    “怎么的了？”正在束手无策之际，乔喜大爷提着锨从远处跑来。
    “出了漏子了！”我焦急地喊着，满想他会跑过来帮我一起铲土补漏。出乎意料，乔喜大爷竟在那边渠岗上站住了，望着我的狼狈模样在笑。
      “大爷快过来堵吧！”对他的从容不迫，我真有些急躁了。
    “不慌！”他一面说一面低下头去，从脚边铲了几锹土培在渠道里，截断了上流的水源。决口的洪流，马上便止住了，我蓦地恍然大悟……
    乔喜大爷走过来帮我补好渠口，踩实了渠岗上新培的土，然后返回去疏通了上流的水源，一切是那样有条不紊，顺顺当当。
    我擦着全身的汗。乔喜大爷装起了一袋烟，望着我又笑了：“傻伙计，不截断水流，光补漏子还能堵得住？”
    是啊！这是个浅近易懂的道理呀！但正是这个浅近易懂的道理，我却不懂得运用它来解决实际问题。我只顾手忙脚乱去弥补眼前的漏洞，根本也没有考虑去断流治本。细想一下，处理其它事情，有时不是也一样不会运用这个浅近的道理吗？然而乔喜大爷很清楚很会运用这个道理。
    太阳照满田野，渠水闪着亮光。我一面想着这个道理，一边顺着渠道走去，一个扁小可笑的影子，又在水面浮动着，这是一个知识分子的影子。
