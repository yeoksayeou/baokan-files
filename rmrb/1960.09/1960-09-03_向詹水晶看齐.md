    Learn From Zhan Shuijing
    Wang Xiren, an outstanding planer in the mechanical workshop of the Dalian Shipyard, humbly learned from Zhan Shuijing, a special-class labor model of Lüda City, regarding his advanced thinking and experience in ensuring high quality and high output. He has created an outstanding record of no defective products for more than seven years, from July 1953 to the present.
    Communist Party member Wang Xiren is a worker with eighteen years of service. After he was transferred to the large planer in 1953, he worked in the same section as Zhan Shuijing and was deeply influenced by Zhan Shuijing's advanced thinking and experience in ensuring product quality. He often thought, "Why can Zhan Shuijing guarantee no defective products? Why do I sometimes have rework and defective products?" Once, he produced a piece of rework, and at this time, the Lüda Daily and the Shipyard Workers' Daily published the news of Zhan Shuijing producing no defective products. When he returned home, he couldn't even eat, and lay on the kang thinking, "In the past, when working for Japanese devils and capitalists, I deliberately made a few rework and defective products to vent my anger; now I am working for myself. Producing rework and defective products wastes manpower and materials, and also affects the completion of the national plan. How can I be worthy of the glorious title of master of the country?" He got up from the kang and took out the Shipyard Workers' Daily of the day and read it carefully. He read a passage in the newspaper that said, "Zhan Shuijing often thinks: If you break a bowl used at home, it's only worth a dime, and it hurts, but if you produce a defective product worth several thousand or tens of thousands of yuan in the factory, shouldn't it hurt even more? Producing defective products not only causes losses to the country but also affects the completion of national tasks. If poor-quality parts are installed on ships, and accidents occur at sea, it will cause incalculable losses to the country and the people!" He was greatly moved after reading this and decided to learn from Zhan Shuijing to eliminate rework and defective products.
    The next day, Wang Xiren got in touch with Zhan Shuijing and signed a "contract" with him. Zhan Shuijing was also very willing to help him. From then on, Wang Xiren carefully applied Zhan Shuijing's advanced experience in production, meticulously followed the operating procedures, and operated carefully. Whenever he changed a part, he would always read the drawings again and again, and look at them in detail and thoroughly; after receiving the blank, he would carefully measure it in all directions, and only start processing after he had a clear idea in his mind. Once, when processing the ship's raft frame, he found that the platform was drawn thirty millimeters short, so he immediately contacted the platform to change it, and no accident was caused.
    Wang Xiren not only produces no defective products but is also a high-yield worker. In this year's "one-equals-several" competition, he operated two machine tools alone, greatly improving production efficiency and achieving "one person equals three people."

    向詹水晶看齐
    大连造船厂机械车间优秀刨工王锡仁，虚心学习旅大市特等劳动模范詹水晶保证优质高产的先进思想和先进经验，创造了从1953年7月到现在七年多无废品的优异成绩。
    共产党员王锡仁是一个有十八年工龄的工人。他从1953年调到大刨床后，和詹水晶在一个工段工作，深深受到詹水晶保证产品质量的先进思想和先进经验的影响。他常常想：“詹水晶为什么能够保证不出废品呢？我怎么有时候还出返工活和废品呢？”有一次，他出了一件返工活，这时正巧旅大日报和造船工人报发表了詹水晶不出废品的消息。他回到家里，连饭也吃不下，躺在炕上琢磨起来：“以前给日本鬼子和资本家干活，故意干出几件返工活和废品出出气；现在是给自己干活，出了返工活和废品，浪费了人力、材料不算，还影响国家计划的完成，怎么能配得上国家主人翁这个光荣称号呢？”他从炕上爬起来，把当天的造船工人报，拿出来仔细地阅读。他读到报上有这样一段话：“詹水晶常想：自己家里用的碗，打碎了一个才值一角钱，就心疼，在工厂出一件废品价值几千元或几万元，就不该心疼吗？出了废品不但国家受到损失，还影响国家任务的完成。如果把质量不好的部件安到船上，轮船在海里发生了事故，要给国家和人民造成不可估计的损失！”他读后受到很大感动，决心向詹水晶学习，消灭返工活和废品。
    第二天，王锡仁就和詹水晶挂上了钩，和詹水晶订了一份“合同”，詹水晶也非常愿意帮助他。从此，王锡仁在生产中认真运用詹水晶的先进经验，一丝不苟地遵守操作规程，细心操作。每换一种部件时，他总要把图纸看了又看，详详细细看透彻；接到毛坯后，又四面八方都仔细量一遍，心中有了数，才动手加工。有一次，加工船瓦架子时，他发现平台少画了三十毫米，就马上联系平台改过来，没有造成事故。
    王锡仁不仅不出废品，而且是一个高产手。在今年的“一顶几”竞赛中，他一个人操作两台机床，大大提高了生产效率，达到了“一人顶三人”。
