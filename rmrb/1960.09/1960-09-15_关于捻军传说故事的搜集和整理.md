   Collecting and Sorting Stories About the Nian Army
	Qiao Zhengde, Secretary of the CPC Mengcheng County Committee, Anhui

    Mengcheng is a relatively ancient county in Anhui Province. As early as the Xia and Shang dynasties more than 2,000 years ago, a county domain was established (though it wasn't called a county then), named Beizhong, which belonged to the jurisdiction of a state. In the Zhou Dynasty (Spring and Autumn period), it was a territory of the State of Chu and renamed Qiyuan. During the Warring States period, it was again renamed Shansang. It was not until the first year of the Tang Dynasty's Tianbao era that it was renamed Mengcheng County. The name was changed more than ten times in total, showing Mengcheng's long history. However, according to the county chronicles and other old books, due to the cruel exploitation and oppression of the ruling class at the time, coupled with the low-lying terrain and barren soil, the people of Mengcheng throughout history lived a life of deep suffering, with no rice for the next day's meal and no clothes to cover their bodies. In order to change their enslaved lives, they united countless times to launch unyielding struggles against the ruling class. Although, due to the limitations of the times and history, and the lack of leadership from an advanced class, each struggle ultimately ended in failure, their actions sowed the seeds of resistance to the ruling class for future generations. This led to the flames of resistance to the ruling class burning more widely and fiercely with each generation, finally erupting in the famous Nian Army uprising movement in the early years of the Xianfeng reign of the Qing Dynasty. It is precisely because of this that there are many legends about its resistance stories. Now I would like to talk about the general situation of the Nian Army resistance stories circulating in the Mengcheng area and the process of our county collecting Nian Army stories.

    The Nian Army uprising lasted for eighteen years. The birthplace of the Nian Army was in the Mengbo area of northern Anhui. The historical background of the Nian Army uprising was consistent with that of the Taiping Rebellion at that time. At this time, the Qing Dynasty's rule had become extremely corrupt, and the feudal landlord class's cruel exploitation had become even more intensified. In addition, there were years of drought and flood disasters, and the peasants were in a state of hunger and cold, with no way out. Unable to endure it any longer, they rose up in revolt under the leadership of Zhang Lexing, Gong Shude (Gong the Blind), Han Laowan, Su Tianfu, and others, who were salt vendors in Shibapu. They raised the banner of "acting on behalf of heaven, killing the rich and helping the poor," killing officials, beating local tyrants, smashing salt shops, and seizing money and food everywhere. Apart from what they ate themselves, the rest was distributed to the people. Therefore, the vast majority of poor people rose up to join the Nian. They had no weapons, so they built their own furnaces to forge them. Weapons such as broadswords, flat-edged spears, rods, bamboo whips, bamboo poles, and sickles were all made by themselves. Having weapons strengthened their military power. The flames of the Nian Army uprising quickly spread to the vast plains on both sides of the Huai River and south of the Yellow River, causing the officials and local tyrants to cry and wail in a state of utter disarray. The vast majority of the people enjoyed a temporary period of peace and prosperity, as a folk song circulating in the Huaibei area at that time said:

    In the second and a half years of Xianfeng, every family was making flat-edged spears,
    Killing many local tyrants and rescuing many poor people.

    Although they later failed, their revolutionary heroic deeds burned like a raging fire throughout the country. As a result, in the twenty-third year of the Guangxu reign of the Qing Dynasty, a peasant riot was organized in Caoshi Market (now belonging to Guoyang) in Mengcheng County, led by Niu Shixiu (also known as Niu Bing), with a force of more than 14,000 people. Such a glorious and great uprising movement was slandered as "Nian bandits running rampant" under the rule of the Kuomintang reactionaries. It was not until the Communist Party led the Chinese people to victory in the revolution that this pearl, which had been buried for more than a hundred years and almost disappeared, was unearthed, brought back to the sunlight, and allowed to shine brightly.

    Since liberation, especially since the Great Leap Forward, under the call of the Party Central Committee, a vigorous movement to collect folk songs and stories has been launched throughout the country. Like other regions, our county formed a Nian Army story collection group in 1958, formulated a collection plan from key points to the whole, and determined the scope of collection. After a few days of brief study, the members of the Nian Army story collection group went to several key townships, such as Gucheng, Maji, and Banqiao Xiaojian, to collect stories. In order to maintain the original folk style of the stories, we adopted the method of interviewing, recording, sorting, and then returning to the county for collective research to put forward opinions and make revisions. Thanks to the attention of the county and township party committees and the efforts of the collectors and organizers, considerable achievements were made after a period of collection and organization. The Provincial Federation of Literary and Art Circles was satisfied with our initial collation of the stories, and several of them were compiled into the Anhui Folk Story Collection. This gave us great encouragement to further improve the work of collecting and sorting Nian Army stories. According to statistics, by the beginning of 1960, the county had established one folk literature research group and eight folk story collection groups. The number of people participating in the Nian Army story collection and activities gradually increased from one in 1955 to dozens, and the collection and organization work was further developed. Up to now, more than 100 Nian Army stories, more than 200 Nian Army folk songs, five folk tunes singing about the Nian Army, four newly compiled Nian Army dramas, one film screenplay, five pieces of Quyi (folk performing arts), and more than 20 pieces of various Nian Army relics have been collected and organized. The publication, performance, and exhibition of these items have been warmly welcomed by the masses. For example, one or two dozen Nian Army stories such as "Prince Lu and His Little Yellow Horse," "Ren Zhu in the Nian," "Gong the Blind Cleverly Takes Mengcheng," and "Li Sanniang" have been published in newspapers and magazines such as *Folk Literature*, *Anhui Folk Story Collection*, *Anhui Literature*, *Shanghai Folk Literature Collection*, and *Fuyang Literature*, and have received high praise from readers across the country. The County Federation of Literary and Art Circles compiled and printed a book of Nian Army stories and distributed it to various townships. The masses all circulated it as a precious reading material. The county's urban and rural amateur art troupes self-compiled a Nian Army drama, which was performed publicly among the masses and was highly praised by the masses. In particular, the descendants of Prince Lu Ren Huabang and Li Sanniang, after watching the play, carried Chairman Mao's portrait, gifts, and firecrackers to the stage to express their appreciation to the actors. In front of the township party committee and the audience, they expressed their gratitude to the Party and their determination to follow the Party and listen to Chairman Mao's words in the future, to do a good job in production, and to support the country's socialist construction, in order to repay the Party and the people for restoring the reputation of their ancestors.

              ×××

    Nian Army stories are widely circulated among the masses. Doing a good job in collecting and organizing these stories seems simple on the surface, but it is not. Through several years of practical work, we have deeply realized that to do a good job in this work, we must first have politics in command. Every folk literature worker must be as ideologically red and firm in their stance as comrades who do other work, and must have a correct historical materialist viewpoint. Only in this way can we correctly study and analyze these legends. Because these legends are mostly preserved in the memories of old people over the age of fifty, some of whom were born into peasant families, and some of whom were from the exploiting class at the time - landlords and rich peasants. Of course, there are more oral legends belonging to the people, but even so, they are still affected to varying degrees by the reactionary ideas of the ruling class at the time. The feudal ruling class and the Kuomintang reactionaries both described the Nian Army uprising as a chaotic revolt by "Nian bandits;" they described the Nian Army as "Nian bandits," "bandits," "house smashers," and "robbers" who did all kinds of evil and acted recklessly. For places that the Nian Army had not been to, they fabricated rumors that the Nian Army had red beards, green eyes, and ate raw things with blood. In short, they depicted the Nian Army as beasts. They not only spread rumors, but also severely suppressed the families of the Nian Army. The Qing court adopted the cruel method of exterminating the entire family and nine generations for those who joined the Nian Army. As a result, after the Nian Army was defeated, many Nian family members changed their names and surnames for a long time and hid in other villages. Although the Party has done a lot of work to restore the reputation of the Nian Army since liberation, these old people still have more or less incorrect views on the Nian Army in their minds. Therefore, when collecting Nian Army stories and legends, if we do not first educate the interviewees, they will regard the heroic actions of the Nian Army in fighting local tyrants and killing officials as bad things, and even be unwilling to talk about them. Even if they talk a little, it is unhealthy. Therefore, this requires every folk literature worker to go deep into the countryside, deep into the masses, to eat, live, and work with them, and to become one with them in every way. In addition to labor and life and before interviews, we must carry out work to restore the reputation of the Nian Army so that the interviewees slowly realize the glory of the Nian Army. Only in this way will they tell the story of the Nian Army. For example, in the already published article "Li Sanniang," when the interviewers first went to interview the storytellers Li Chaopin and Li Dengxian (both descendants of Li Sanniang), they were always timid and unwilling to speak. Later, the interviewers pointed out that the Nian Army's actions of fighting local tyrants and killing officials were revolutionary and very glorious. After hearing this, they excitedly told the story of Li Sanniang endlessly. There were similar situations with the storytellers of other stories, so I will not list them one by one. In addition, county and township professional and amateur literary and art groups also carried out singing and dancing activities about the Nian Army's deeds. Using various different art forms to write it out, sing it out, dance it out, and paint it out for the masses to see, over time, the masses naturally reversed their previous incorrect views on the Nian Army.

    Some people say: "When doing folk stories, just collect them and organize them well." This statement is one-sided and wrong. We say that folk literature is indeed the oral literature of the working people, but once it has passed through the mouths and hands of the reactionary ruling class, it has been tampered with, and the original color of the story has been changed. When we collect such stories, if we do not study and deliberate, discard the dross, and take the essence, we will confuse fish eyes with pearls and confuse black and white. The stories organized in this way cannot reflect the true face of the Nian Army's struggle activities, nor can they achieve the effect of using the past for the present and serving the cause of socialist construction.

    In order to gradually improve the quality of works, continuously increase new forces, and expand the scope of collection, we often organize folk literature enthusiasts and some activists to hold study meetings, symposiums, experience exchange meetings, short-term folk literature training classes, and symposiums for the elderly. Through these meetings, every folk literature enthusiast has gained a lot of experience and knowledge.

    Looking back at our work of collecting stories and legends about the Nian Army, although we have achieved some results, it is still far from enough. In order to effectively do this work in the future, we must continue to adhere to politics in command, resolutely implement the Party's literary and art policies, strengthen the study of Chairman Mao's works, hold high the red banner of Mao Zedong's literary and art thought, greatly boost revolutionary spirit, and, on the basis of the initial achievements we have already achieved, more comprehensively carry out the work of collecting and organizing Nian Army stories and legends. We must make this folk art flower bloom more vividly and beautifully in the large garden of socialist literature and art!

   关于捻军传说故事的搜集和整理	中共安徽蒙城县委书记处书记　乔正德
    蒙城是安徽省一个比较古老的县，远在两千多年以前的夏商时期，就建立了县域（当时不叫县），名叫北冢，是属于州管辖。在周代（春秋）是楚国的属地，改名叫漆园。到了战国时期，又改称山桑。直到唐天宝元年才改叫蒙城县。前后共改换名称有十余次之多。可见蒙城历史的悠久了。但从县志和其他旧书中来看，由于当时受统治阶级的残酷的剥削和压迫，加之地势低洼，土质瘠薄，蒙城历代的人民都是过着家无隔日米、身无遮体衣的灾难深重的痛苦生活。他们为了改变自己被奴役的生活，曾无数次地团结起来向统治阶级展开不屈不挠的斗争。尽管由于时代的和历史的限制，以及没有先进阶级的领导，每次斗争的结果，终归是失败的结局。但他们的斗争行动却给后人播下了反抗统治阶级的火种。以至使后来的反抗统治阶级的火焰一代比一代燃烧得更普遍、更猛烈，终于在清末咸丰初年，爆发了一次在我国近代史上著名的捻军起义运动。正是因为这样，它的反抗故事的传说也很多。现在想谈的是捻军反抗故事在蒙城地区传说的概况和我县搜集捻军故事的经过。
    捻军从起义到结束长达十八年之久。捻军的发祥地，就是在安徽北部蒙亳一带地区。捻军的起义和当时的太平军起义的历史背景是一致的。这时清廷的统治已经腐朽到极点，而封建地主阶级残酷剥削也更变本加厉了，加之连年水旱灾害，农民处于饥寒交迫的境地，走投无路，忍无可忍，就在十八铺盐贩子张乐行、龚树德（龚瞎子）、韩老万、苏天福等人为首的领导下，揭竿起义了。他们打着“替天行道，杀富济贫”的口号，到处杀官府，打老财，砸盐店，夺得钱粮，除自己吃食外，其余一律分给百姓。因此，广大穷苦百姓，都纷纷地起来在捻。他们没有武器，就自己支炉打造。如大刀、齐头鐥、稍子棍、竹节鞭、竹竿标和铛镰等等，都是他们自造的。有了武器就壮大了军威。捻军起义的烈火很快地蔓延到淮河两岸和黄河以南的广大平原地区，打得官府老财，痛哭流涕，狼狈不堪，广大百姓得到了一时的安居乐业，正如当时淮北一带流传的一首民谣所说的：
    咸丰二年半，家家都打齐头鐥，杀了多少老财主，救了多少穷光蛋。
    他们后来虽然失败了，但他们的革命英雄行为却像怒火一样在全国各地燃烧着，以至后来到清光绪二十三年的时候又在蒙城县境曹市集（现属涡阳）以牛士修（即牛丙）为首组织了一铺一万四千多人的农民暴动。这样光辉伟大的起义运动在国民党反动派的统治下被诬蔑为“捻匪猖乱”，直到共产党领导中国人民革命胜利后的今天，才把这颗已经埋没百余年几乎绝迹的珍珠挖掘出土，重见阳光，大放异彩。
            ××× 
    解放以后，特别是大跃进以来，在党中央的号召下，全国各地的采风运动蓬勃开展起来，我县也和其他各地一样，全县文艺工作者，在1958年组成了一个捻军故事搜集小组，制订了由重点到全面的搜集计划和确定搜集的范围。捻军故事搜集小组的人员经过简短的几天学习，就分别深入到?城、马集、板桥小涧等几个重点乡去搜集。为了使故事保持原有的民间风格，即采取了边访问、边记录、边整理、回县集体研究提出意见，进行加工修改的方法。由于县、乡各级党委的重视和搜集整理者的努力，经过一段时间的搜集整理工作，取得了不小成绩。省文联看了我们初次整理的故事感到满意，并有几篇编选在安徽民间故事集中。这就给我们进一步做好搜集整理捻军故事的工作一个很大的鼓舞。据统计，到1960年初，全县共建立民间文学研究小组一个，民间故事搜集小组八个。参加捻军故事搜集和参加活动的人员，由1955年的一人，逐渐增加到几十人，搜集、整理工作得到了进一步发展。到现在已搜集整理出的捻军故事一百余篇，捻军歌谣二百多首，歌唱捻军的民间小调五个，新编的捻军戏剧四个，电影文学剧本一部，曲艺五篇，收藏捻军遗留下的各种器械二十多件。以上这些东西的发表、演出、展览，都受到了群众的热烈欢迎。如捻军故事《鲁王和他的小黄马》、《任柱在捻》、《龚瞎子智取蒙城》、《李三娘》等一、二十篇故事，先后在《民间文学》、《安徽民间故事集》、《安徽文学》、《上海民间文学集刊》和《阜阳文艺》等报纸杂志上发表以后，得到全国读者的很高评价。县文联编印了一本捻军故事集发给各乡以后，群众都把它当做珍贵的读物一样传阅。县城乡业余文工团自编了一个捻军戏剧，在群众中公演后，大受群众赞扬；特别是鲁王任化邦和李三娘的后代看过戏后，抬着毛主席像、礼品和纸炮到舞台上去慰问演员。并当着乡党委和观众的面，表示感谢党、表示今后坚决跟着党走、坚决听毛主席的话，搞好生产，支援国家社会主义建设，以报答党和人民为他们的祖先恢复名誉的大恩。
              ×××
    捻军故事在群众中传说很广泛，搞好这一搜集整理工作表面看起来似乎很简单，其实不然。通过几年来的实际工作，我们深刻体会到，要搞好这一工作，首先要有政治挂帅，每个民间文学工作者都要和做其他工作的同志一样，做到思想红、立场稳和必须具备正确的历史唯物主义的观点，只有这样才能正确地研究、分析这些传说。因为这些传说，大都保存在五十岁以上的老年人的记忆里，这些人有的是出身于农民，有的是当时的剥削阶级——地主富农。当然属于人民群众口头的传说是多的，但尽管如此，他们也还是会受到当时的统治阶级反动思想的不同程度的影响。封建统治阶级和国民党反动派，都把捻军起义说成是捻匪造乱；把捻军说成是无恶不作、胡做非为的“捻匪”、“土匪”、“砸家”、“强盗”。对于捻军没有到过的地方，他们就造谣说捻军是红胡子、绿眼睛、吃有血的生东西。总之，他们把捻军形容得成为野兽一般。他们不光散布谣言，而且对于捻军家属严加镇压。清廷对于参加捻军的人，采取了一人在捻，全家该剿，户灭九族的残酷手段。致使捻军覆灭以后，许多捻属长期改名换姓，隐藏外乡。虽然解放后，党为捻军做了许多恢复名誉的工作，但这些老年人在思想上仍然存在着或多或少的对捻军的不正确的看法。所以在搜集捻军故事传说时，要是事先不对被访问者进行一番教育，那他们就会把捻军打老财、杀官府的英雄行为当作是坏事，甚至不愿意向外讲，即使讲一点，也是不健康的东西。因此这就需要每个民间文学工作者深入农村、深入群众，和他们同吃同住同劳动，处处打成一片，并在劳动、生活中和访问之前，进行为捻军恢复名誉的工作，使被访问者慢慢地认识到捻军的光荣，这样，他们才会把捻军的事情讲出来。例如已经发表的《李三娘》一篇，在访问者开始去访问讲述者李超品、李登先（他们都是李三娘的后代）时，他们总是畏首畏尾地不肯讲。后经访问者指出，捻军打老财、杀官府的行动是革命的，是非常光荣的。他们听了之后，才兴奋地把李三娘的事情滔滔不绝地讲出来。其他故事的讲述者也有类似情况，就不一一例举了。除此之外，平时县、乡各个专业和业余文艺团体，还开展了捻军事迹的歌舞活动。利用各种不同文艺形式把它写出来、唱出来、跳出来、画出来给群众看，这样，时间一长，群众自然而然地就扭转了以前对捻军的不正确的看法。
    有人说：“搞民间故事，只要能搜集到，整理好就行了。”这种说法是片面的，也是错误的。我们说民间文学固然是劳动人民的口头文学，但它一旦经过反动统治阶级的口、手以后，就被他们篡改了，也就改变了原来故事的本色。当我们搜集到这样的故事时，如不加以研究、推敲，去其糟粕，取其精华，就会鱼目混珠，黑白不分，这样整理出来的故事，就不可能反映捻军斗争活动的真面目，也不可能收到古为今用、为社会主义建设事业服务的效果。
    为了逐渐提高作品质量，不断增加新生力量和扩大搜集范围，我们经常组织民间文学爱好者和一些积极分子举行学习会、座谈会、经验交流会和举办短期民间文学训练班以及老年人座谈会。通过这些会议，使得每个民间文学爱好者都取得了不少的经验，长了不少的知识。
    回顾一下我们关于捻军故事传说的搜集工作，虽然取得了一些成绩，但还是远远不够的。为了今后切实做好这一工作，必须继续坚持政治挂帅，坚决贯彻执行党的文艺方针政策，加强毛主席的著作学习，高高地举起毛泽东文艺思想的红旗，大鼓革命干劲，在已经获得初步成绩的基础上，更全面地开展搜集整理捻军故事传说的工作。一定要使这束民间文艺之花，在社会主义文艺的大花园里开放得更鲜艳，更美丽！
