    The “Two-Five System” leadership method, created by Wuqiao County, Hebei Province, has increasingly proven its strong vitality after several months of practice. This is not only because it scientifically arranges the labor, work, and study of cadres, but more importantly, because it conforms to the leadership method that our Party has consistently advocated, combining leadership with the masses, and generality with specificity.
    The issue of leadership methods has always been closely linked to the Marxist-Leninist materialist conception of history and methodology. Comrade Deng Xiaoping said: "If the problem of the Party's advocacy of 'from the masses, to the masses' is not resolved from the perspective of understanding methods, then the relationship between the Party and the people cannot be truly resolved." This means that in order to do their work well, our Party's cadres must not only have the desire to serve the people, but also solve such a problem from the perspective of ideology and methodology, that is, to truly recognize that the people are the creators of history, and the working class must rely on the strength of its own class and the strength of all working people to eliminate classes and eliminate exploitation, completely liberate themselves and all working people, and build a beautiful and happy communist society. Starting from such a basic belief, when we do our work, we must conscientiously implement the work method of coming from the masses and going back to the masses, humbly listen to the voices and opinions of the masses, be good at using the masses' own experience to educate the masses, patiently publicize the Party's policies, and specifically guide the masses' practical activities so that the masses can actively carry out struggles to complete the tasks of the Party in each period. To do this, our cadres, especially leading cadres, must not only go deep into the masses, but also participate in the practical activities of the masses. Because only by participating in the practical activities of the masses, and integrating with the masses in production and life, can we strengthen the sense of ownership of the people and gain the full trust of the people, on the one hand, and on this basis can we consult with the masses and truly gather the opinions of the masses; on the other hand, it can also enable us to have a true understanding of many things and continuously improve our level of understanding, so that the ideas we come up with and the methods we think of are more in line with reality and achieve the purpose of effectively transforming the objective world. You should know that to do our work, we must come up with ideas, think of methods, or formulate work plans. And ideas, methods, and work plans can only be reflections of the objective world, and their raw materials or semi-finished products mainly come from the practice of the people. Our minds can only act as a processing plant to create finished products, otherwise they are of no use. Moreover, whether the finished products made by processing through our minds are suitable for use, correct or incorrect, must be tested in the practice of the people. Comrade Mao Zedong once said: "The viewpoint of practice is the first and basic viewpoint of dialectical materialism's theory of knowledge." And: "Discover truth through practice, and then prove and develop truth through practice." This shows that any good leadership method must reflect the leader's high mass viewpoint and their high practical viewpoint; only in this way can effective leadership be implemented.
    It should be said that the "Two-Five System" leadership method is a leadership method with a high mass viewpoint and a high practical viewpoint. It stipulates that all cadres below the county level must spend five days out of seven going down to do work; and during these five days, they must eat, live, work, and consult with the masses, rely on the masses to discover problems, and rely on the masses to solve problems. In this way, leading cadres can spend most of their time going deep into reality and into the masses, taking the mass line in their work, not only greatly reducing meetings and documents, but also enabling key issues in their work to be discovered and resolved in a timely manner at the production site, and enabling many creations and advanced experiences of the masses to be summarized and promoted in a timely manner below. According to statistics from 24 counties and districts in Hebei Province, since the implementation of the "Two-Five System" leadership method, due to the fact that cadres have gone deep into reality, meetings and reports in May have been reduced by one-third to two-thirds, and various documents have been reduced by two-fifths to three-fifths; while the experience summarized and promoted has increased compared to the past. Tang County alone summarized and promoted more than 230 major advanced experiences from January to May.
    The "Two-Five System" leadership method also emphasizes that cadres must personally participate in the practical activities of the masses. In this way, cadres can lead the production and life of the masses not only with indirect experience, but also with direct experience. For example, in the past, many leading cadres of county-level organs often could not participate in labor due to their busy work, and at most they could go down to the commune members for one month a year as stipulated. Since the implementation of the "Two-Five System" leadership method, they have generally been able to participate in labor for two days a week, not only increasing the time spent on labor, but also achieving the regularization of labor. As for the general cadres, they spend more time participating in labor, generally two to three days a week. Cadres participate in labor more often, which is not only a matter of increasing labor force, but more importantly, it transforms the thinking of cadres, increases their perceptual knowledge, and establishes a closer connection between them and the masses. This is of great benefit to strengthening the class viewpoint and mass viewpoint of cadres, establishing a hard-working and simple work style, and overcoming subjectivity and one-sidedness in work. Since the implementation of the "Two-Five System" leadership method, there have been many cases in Hebei Province where cadres, especially leading cadres, have discovered and solved problems by participating in labor, and have encouraged the enthusiasm of grassroots cadres and the masses. For example, a considerable number of the more than 800 team cadres in Chengguan Commune, Wuqiao County, were unable to participate in labor regularly in the past. Since the implementation of the "Two-Five System" leadership method, under the influence of cadres of higher-level organs taking the lead in participating in labor, they have all universally participated in labor. This summer, the commune adopted the method of harvesting wheat for the first time, and the stubble left in the ground would affect the quality of summer sowing. Wang Zhili, the first secretary of the commune's Party committee, discovered this problem by working with the masses, and after absorbing the experience of other places, he proposed a "shallow plowing to eliminate stubble" planting method, which ensured that the summer sowing task could be completed on time, with quality and quantity.
    The implementation of the "Two-Five System" leadership method also enables cadres to combine general calls with specific guidance more closely, thereby greatly enriching leadership experience and making leadership work more practical and effective. We all know that no matter what work we do, we cannot only have general, principled calls and arrangements, but also specific guidance, that is, we must come up with "models." This requires leading cadres to go deep down, break through a point, and gain experience. The implementation of the "Two-Five System" leadership method ensures that cadres have time to "stay at a point," spending two to three days a week going deep into a point to dissect sparrows and conduct serious investigation and research; it also ensures that they have time to "turn their faces" to understand the overall situation and guide the overall work. For example, in order to comprehensively grasp the production and life of the masses, the Fengrun County Party Committee of Hebei Province, after going deep into the Xuanzhuang Commune to work, grasped two typical examples, one good and one bad, and found out the general rules through dissecting sparrows, which powerfully guided the overall work, and quickly implemented the production, life, and summer harvest distribution of 125 production teams in the eight communes of the county.
    Finally, the implementation of the "Two-Five System" leadership method also enables cadres to have time to go deep into reality, and time to study and summarize work, study theory and current affairs policies. This enables theory to be better connected with reality, and can quickly improve cadres' cognitive ability and policy level. On a national scale, it has not been long since the widespread implementation of the "Two-Five System" or similar leadership methods, but many cadres have further learned how to grasp the main contradictions in their work, how to take the mass line, and they patiently persuade and educate the masses on everything, rather than taking simplistic methods; they have achieved a close combination of soaring enthusiasm and a spirit of scientific analysis, and are not only brave in breaking conservative ideas, but also work practically, conscientiously, and meticulously. The universal development of all these good ideological styles is a clear sign of the ever-increasing cognitive ability and leadership level of cadres.
    The superiority of the "Two-Five System" leadership method has been recognized by more and more comrades in practice, so they can consciously implement this new leadership method. However, because the "Two-Five System" leadership method is directly opposed to subjective and bureaucratic leadership methods, it is impossible to have no struggle in the process of implementation. For example, a few comrades still believe that there is so much work and so many tasks that there is no time to go deep down. Facts have proved that the key to the problem is not whether one can go down, but whether one wants to go down. As long as these comrades weigh whether it is better to establish a clear mass viewpoint and practical viewpoint, go deep down to implement direct and specific leadership, or sit in the office and rely on meetings and documents to implement indirect leadership, they will distinguish between the important and the unimportant, get rid of the shackles of formalism, and resolutely go to reality and to the masses. They will realize that in this era of the Great Leap Forward, where "one day equals twenty years," due to the vigorous efforts and hard work of the broad masses, our cause has developed very rapidly, so new things, new experiences, and new problems are emerging one after another. Even if the leader is slightly detached from reality and the masses, their leadership will not be able to adapt to the needs of the development of the situation. Comrade Mao Zedong said: "The more arduous the struggle, the more it is necessary for the leadership of the Communist Party to be closely combined with the demands of the broad masses, and the more it is necessary for the general calls and individual guidance of the Communist Party to be closely combined, and to thoroughly smash the subjective and bureaucratic leadership methods."
    Some comrades also believe that "going deep too much will weaken collective leadership," "leaving too few people in the organs will make it impossible to grasp the overall situation and will affect departmental work," and so on. Of course, after a large number of cadres go deep into the front line, a series of specific problems still need to be solved, such as the problem of combining top and bottom, the problem of combining point and surface, and the problem of combining central work and departmental work. However, one should never think that going deep will affect collective leadership and grasping the overall situation; otherwise, one does not understand that problems and situations come first and mainly from the masses and from the front line of production; one does not understand that knowledge comes from practice, and only by going deep can one enrich the wisdom of collective leadership and grasp comprehensive practical materials. As for the problem of combining top and bottom, it can be solved by adopting the method of one team and two groups of people. As for the problem of point and surface, as long as the "Two-Five System" provisions on "staying at a point" and "turning the face" are conscientiously implemented, and appropriate arrangements are made in time, and the experience in this area is constantly summarized, it will not only not separate the two, but will also make the two combine better. As for the relationship between central work and departmental work, it is the same. As long as it is handled well, it will not only not affect each other, but on the contrary, because the majority of people in a department go to the countryside to work, understand the needs of production, and understand the needs of the masses, it will be easier to arrange departmental work, and a situation of "the center leads the business, and the business guarantees the center" will be formed. For example, in the past, when the banking department of Wuqiao County loaned to production teams, it needed to go through four levels of application, investigation, approval, and distribution because it did not understand the situation very well. Since the implementation of the "Two-Five System," because cadres have gone deep into the production teams and understand the needs of the production teams, loans often go to the front of production, and have more powerfully supported production.
    From this, it can be seen that the above-mentioned statements are untenable; and the main reason why some comrades have such views is that they have not yet solved the problem of ideological understanding very well. Therefore, in order to enable the "Two-Five System" leadership method to be implemented more universally and deeply, it is necessary for our comrades to conscientiously study Comrade Mao Zedong's "On Practice" and related works on leadership methods. In this way, they will realize that the "Two-Five System" leadership method is a scientific leadership method that conforms to the Marxist worldview and epistemology, thereby further improving their awareness of implementing this leadership method and enabling it to play a greater role in practice.

    “二五制”领导方法的优越性
    崔鹏云
    河北省吴桥县创立的“二五制”领导方法，经过几个月的实践，越来越证明了它是有强大生命力的。这不仅是因为它科学地安排了干部的劳动、工作和学习，更主要的是因为它符合于我们党一贯倡导的领导和群众相结合、一般和具体相结合的领导方法。
    领导方法问题，从来就是和马克思列宁主义的唯物史观和方法论密切地联系着的。邓小平同志说：“如果不从认识方法上解决党的主张必须是‘从群众中来，到群众中去’的问题，那末，党同人民群众的关系问题仍然不能真正地解决。”这就是说，我们党的干部为要做好工作，不仅要有为人民服务的愿望，而且必须从思想方法上解决这样一个问题，这就是要真正认识到：人民群众是历史的创造者，工人阶级必须依靠本阶级的力量和全体劳动人民的力量，才能消灭阶级和消灭剥削，彻底解放自己和全体劳动人民，建成美满幸福的共产主义社会。从这样的基本信念出发，我们在做工作的时候，就必须认真地执行从群众中来再到群众中去的工作方法，要虚心地倾听群众的呼声和意见，要善于利用群众自身的经验去教育群众，耐心地宣传党的方针政策，并且要具体地指导群众的实践活动，使群众都能为了完成党每一时期的任务而积极地开展斗争。要做到这些，我们的干部、特别是领导干部，不仅要深入到群众中去，而且要参加群众的实践活动。因为只有参加群众的实践活动，在生产和生活上和群众打成一片，一方面可以加强人民群众的主人翁感，取得人民群众的充分信任，在这个基础上才有可能做到和群众同商量，真正把群众的意见集中起来；另一方面还可以使我们对许多事物有真知真解，不断地提高自己的认识水平，从而使我们出的主意和想的办法比较地符合于实际，达到有效地改造客观世界的目的。要知道，我们做工作，就要出主意、想办法，或者订工作计划。而主意、办法和工作计划，只能是客观世界的反映，其原料或半成品主要来自人民群众的实践之中，我们的头脑只能作为一个加工厂而起制成完成品的作用，否则是一点用处也没有的。而且经过我们的头脑加工制成的完成品是否合用，正确或不正确，还得在人民群众的实践中去考验。毛泽东同志曾经说过：“实践的观点是辩证唯物论的认识论之第一的和基本的观点”。又说：“通过实践而发现真理，又通过实践而证实真理和发展真理”。这就说明，任何好的领导方法，都必须反映出领导者的高度的群众观点，又反映出他们的高度的实践观点；只有这样，才能实行切实有效的领导。
    应当说，“二五制”的领导方法，正是一种具有高度的群众观点，又有高度的实践观点的领导方法。它规定所有县以下的干部，在七天之中必须有五天深入下去做工作；而在这五天之中，又必须和群众同吃同住同劳动同商量，依靠群众发现问题，又依靠群众解决问题。这样，就使领导干部都能把主要的时间用于深入实际、深入群众，在工作中大走群众路线，不但大大地减少了会议和文件，而且使工作中的关键问题在生产现场就及时地发现和解决了，使群众中的许多创造和先进经验在下面就及时地予以总结和推广了。据河北省二十四个县、区的统计，实行“二五制”领导方法以来，由于干部深入了实际，5月份的会议和表报就减少了三分之一到三分之二，各种文件减少了五分之二到五分之三；而总结推广的经验却比过去增加了，仅唐县1至5月份就总结推广了各种重大的先进经验二百三十多条。
    “二五制”的领导方法，还强调干部要亲自参加群众的实践活动。这样，干部就不但可以用间接的经验，而且能够用直接的经验来领导群众的生产和生活。例如，县级机关的领导干部，过去许多人常因工作繁忙而不能参加劳动，顶多能按照规定一年有一个月下去当社员。自从实行“二五制”的领导方法以来，他们一般都能做到一周中有两天参加劳动，不但参加劳动的时间多了，而且达到了劳动经常化。至于一般干部参加劳动的时间更多，一般是每周二至三天。干部更多地参加了劳动，这不仅是增加了劳动力的问题，更重要的是改造了干部的思想，增加了他们的感性知识，并且使他们和群众建立了更加紧密的联系。这对于增强干部的阶级观点和群众观点，树立艰苦朴实的工作作风，克服工作中的主观性和片面性，都大有好处。自从实行“二五制”的领导方法以来，河北省各地因为干部、特别是领导干部参加劳动而发现问题和解决问题，因为干部、特别是领导干部参加劳动而鼓舞了基层干部和群众的积极性的事例，是非常之多的。例如，吴桥县城关公社的八百多名小队干部，过去有相当一部分人不能经常参加劳动；自从实行“二五制”的领导方法以后，在上级机关干部带头参加劳动的影响下，都普遍地参加了劳动。今年夏天，这个公社第一次采取割麦的办法，麦茬留在地里，会影响夏播质量。公社党委第一书记王之礼，通过和群众一起劳动，发现了这个问题，又吸取其他地方的经验以后，就提出了一个“浅耕灭茬”的播种方法，保证了夏播任务能够按时、按质、按量完成。
    实行“二五制”的领导方法，还使干部把一般号召和具体指导更加紧密地结合了起来，从而大大地丰富了领导的经验，使领导工作更加切实有力。我们都知道，不论做任何工作，都不能只有一般的原则性的号召和布置，还必须有具体的指导，也就是要拿出“样板”来。这就要求领导干部必须深入下去，突破一点，取得经验。实行“二五制”的领导方法，就保证了干部既有时间“蹲点”，在一周中有二至三天深入一点解剖麻雀，认真地作调查研究；又保证了他们有时间“转面”，了解全面情况，指导全面工作。例如，河北省丰润县委为了全面地抓好群众的生产和生活，在深入宣庄公社办公以后，就抓住好坏两个典型，通过解剖麻雀，找出了一般规律，有力地指导了全面工作，使这个县八个公社的一百二十五个生产队的生产、生活和夏收分配很快地落实下来。
    最后，实行“二五制”的领导方法，还使干部既有时间深入实际，又有时间研究总结工作，学习理论和时事政策。这就使理论更好地联系了实际，能够迅速地提高干部的认识能力和政策水平。在全国范围来说，普遍推行“二五制”或者和“二五制”类似的领导方法的时间并不久，但是已经有许多干部进一步学会了如何在工作中抓主要矛盾，如何走群众路线，他们遇事耐心地对群众进行说服教育，而不是采取简单化的方法；他们做到了把冲天的干劲和科学分析的精神密切地结合起来，不仅勇于打破保守思想，还能踏实地、认真地、细致地做工作。所有这些优良的思想作风的普遍发扬，就是干部的认识能力和领导水平在日益提高的鲜明标志。
    “二五制”的领导方法所具有的这些优越性，在实践中已经被越来越多的同志认识到了，因而他们都能自觉地执行这种新的领导方法。但是由于“二五制”的领导方法是直接和主观主义、官僚主义的领导方法相对立的，所以在执行的过程中就不可能没有斗争。例如，少数同志就仍然认为，工作这样多，任务这样繁重，哪有时间深入下去。事实证明，问题的关键绝不在于能不能下去，而是想不想下去。只要这些同志衡量一下，是树立起明确的群众观点和实践观点，深入下去实行直接的具体的领导好，还是坐在办公室里依靠会议和文件实行间接的领导好，他们就会分清轻重，摆脱事务主义的束缚，毅然决然地走向实际，走向群众。他们就会认识到，在这“一天等于二十年”的大跃进时代，由于广大群众发愤图强，艰苦奋斗，我们的事业发展得非常快，因而新事物、新经验、新问题层出不穷，领导者那怕是稍微脱离实际和脱离群众，就会使他们的领导不能适应形势发展的需要。毛泽东同志说过：“斗争愈是艰苦，就愈是需要共产党人的领导和广大群众的要求密切地相结合，愈是需要共产党人的一般号召和个别指导密切地相结合，而彻底粉碎主观主义的和官僚主义的领导方法。”
    还有一些同志认为，“深入多了会削弱集体领导”，“机关留人少了，掌握不了全面情况，会影响部门工作”，等等。当然，在大批干部深入第一线后，还需要解决一系列具体问题，如上下结合问题、点面结合问题、中心工作与部门工作结合的问题。但是，决不应因此就认为深入下去会影响集体领导和掌握全面情况；否则，就是不懂得，问题和情况是首先而且主要来自群众，来自生产第一线；就是不懂得认识来源于实践，只有深入下去才能丰富集体领导的智慧，才能掌握全面的实际的材料。至于上下结合的问题，只要采取一个班子、两套人马的作法，就可以解决。点和面的问题，则只要认真地执行“二五制”关于“蹲点”和“转面”的规定，在时间上作妥善的安排，又能不断地总结这方面的经验，那就不仅不会使两者分离，而且会使两者结合得更好。至于中心工作和部门工作的关系问题也是一样，只要处理得好，不仅不会互相影响，而且恰恰相反，一个部门由于多数人下乡工作，了解生产的需要，了解群众的需要，就更便于安排部门工作，而且会形成“中心带业务，业务保中心”的局面。例如，吴桥县银行部门，过去贷款给生产队，由于情况了解得不多，需要经过申请、调查、批准、发放四道关口。自从实行“二五制”以后，由于干部深入生产队，了解生产队的需要，因而贷款经常走到生产的前头，更加有力地支援了生产。
    由此可见，上述种种说法都是不能成立的；而有些同志所以会有那样的看法，又主要是因为他们还没有很好地解决思想认识问题。因此，为了使“二五制”的领导方法能够更加普遍深入地贯彻执行，我们的同志有必要认真地学习毛泽东同志的《实践论》和有关谈领导方法的著作。这样，他们就会认识到“二五制”的领导方法是符合于马克思主义世界观和认识论的一种科学的领导方法，从而更加提高自己对执行这一领导方法的自觉性，使它在实践中发挥更大的作用。
