　　Pig raising and manure accumulation are the most effective measures to solve the fertilizer problem in a more, faster, better, and more economical way. A pig is a small-scale fertilizer factory. Pig manure is the best fertilizer. If all parts of the country consciously regard manure accumulation as the primary purpose of pig raising and run these one to two hundred million small "fertilizer factories" well, they will be able to produce hundreds of billions of catties of high-quality fertilizer every year. Isn't this more, faster, better, and more economical?

　　In recent years, the Party and the government have vigorously promoted pig raising and manure accumulation, and many advanced units have emerged throughout the country with more pig raising, more manure accumulation, and more grain production, which in turn has promoted better leaps forward in agriculture and animal husbandry. Tangjiagou Commune in Qixia County, Shandong Province, is a clear example. In the past, this commune had few pigs, a shortage of fertilizer, poor land, and low grain yields, relying on the state for grain supply every year. Since communization, this commune has firmly grasped pig raising and manure accumulation as an important measure to increase production, and pigs, fertilizer, and grain have been advancing together in direct proportion. In 1957, only 3,830 pigs were raised here, with an average of over 600 catties of pen manure applied per mu, and half of the land was actually not fertilized, with a grain yield of only 290 catties per mu. In 1958, the number of pigs increased to 10,228, with an average of 3,000 catties of pen manure applied per mu, and the grain yield per mu leaped to 467 catties. In 1959, the number of pigs developed to 15,300, with 5,100 catties of pen manure applied per mu, and the grain yield per mu reached 546 catties. Due to the substantial increase in grain yield every year, pig production has also developed rapidly. At present, the number of pigs in stock in this commune has reached 22,520, almost six times that before communization. Of course, the rapid increase in grain yield is not solely due to increased fertilizer application; but it is an extremely important factor, which is beyond doubt.

　　Since the Party Central Committee issued the call to raise pigs in a big way, all parts of the country have been striving to develop pig production. However, some units have raised more pigs but have not accumulated more fertilizer accordingly. The situation of the two production teams of the Sanye Brigade of the Tangjiagou People's Commune is thought-provoking. The production conditions of the two teams are basically the same, and the average number of pigs raised is also equal. The first team paid great attention to accumulating more fertilizer, and last year accumulated an average of more than 20,000 catties of stable manure per pig. The third team did not establish a manure accumulation system, and a lot of fertilizer was lost. Last year, an average of only 7,000 catties of fertilizer was accumulated per pig.

　　Why have some units raised more pigs but not accumulated more fertilizer? The most important reason is that the mode of production of the pig raising industry has changed, but the management work has not kept up. In the era of the individual economy, each household was a production unit and also a management unit; all pig-raising families let the pig produce manure first, and then meat, and manure accumulation and meat production were unified. In the people's commune, collective breeding has become the main way of raising pigs, and pig farms are managed by animal husbandry professional teams. The rational division of labor between agriculture and animal husbandry within the commune is a major progress. However, some units, because ideological work is not done deeply enough, and lack the necessary system to guarantee it, their animal husbandry professional teams mainly focus on how many pigs are raised and how much meat is produced, rather than how much fertilizer is accumulated. Some feeders are busy feeding pigs and cannot often pad the pen and accumulate fertilizer; in some places, in order to maintain the cleanliness and hygiene of the pig farm, the feces are "disposed of" instead of being collected in time as fertilizer. Many breeding units have not insisted on implementing the system of "determining fertilizer based on pigs and rewarding excess". In order to solve this problem, on the one hand, extensive publicity and education should be carried out to make everyone fully aware of the importance of pig raising and manure accumulation; on the other hand, the management system should be further improved, and two indicators should be specified for pig farms: one is how many pigs are raised and how much meat is produced; the other is how much fertilizer is accumulated. Any pig farm that fails to complete any one indicator is not considered a good pig farm.

　　Improving pig farm equipment and improving manure accumulation methods are effective measures to ensure more pig manure accumulation. The layout of the pig farm should not only facilitate feeding management, but also facilitate manure accumulation and transportation. It is necessary to advocate building farms locally, accumulating manure and applying fertilizer locally, and establishing pig farms near high-yield areas and low-yield fields as much as possible, in order to save labor for fertilizer transportation. Pig raising should have pens, and pig pens should have impermeable and non-leaking manure floors, and manure pits for storing feces and urine. Where conditions permit, it is best to build hard floors (paved with three-in-one soil or stones). The fertilizer accumulated on hard floors is more (50% to 100% more than soft floors), the quality is better, and it is also easy to clean and keep the pig pens clean and hygienic. Advanced manure accumulation methods such as frequent padding of the pen, frequent sweeping of the pen, and frequent removal of manure should be widely promoted. In some areas, people are accustomed to raising pigs by grazing. Attention should be paid to collecting fertilizer so as not to lose it. It is necessary to conduct in-depth education for the feeders to make them fully aware of the importance of pig raising and manure accumulation, and to turn pig farms into the most reliable fertilizer depots for communes and production teams. It is necessary to further improve the system of pig raising and manure accumulation, and implement the tasks of pig raising and manure accumulation to the breeding farms at the same time, stipulate the fertilizer accumulation quota by season and month, conduct regular evaluations and inspections, and give rewards according to the system. For some commune members' families who raise pigs, measures should be taken to record work points or pay cash to encourage them to accumulate more fertilizer for use by the production team. The experience of many regions has proved that as long as we adhere to putting politics in command, tell the masses the importance of paying attention to manure accumulation in pig raising, and tell them the great significance of manure accumulation for implementing the policy of taking agriculture as the foundation of the national economy, and everyone takes action, we can completely accumulate a large amount of pig manure while rapidly developing pig production, and promote the continuous leap forward in agricultural production.

### 养猪必须注意多积肥

　　养猪必须注意多积肥
    养猪积肥是多快好省地解决肥料问题的最有效的措施。一头猪就是一个小型化肥厂。猪粪是最好的肥料。如果全国各地都自觉地把积肥作为养猪的首要目的，把这一两亿个小“化肥厂”办得好好的，每年将能生产几千亿斤优质肥料，这还不是又多、又快、又好、又省么？
    近几年来，党和政府大力提倡养猪积肥，全国各地出现了许多养猪多、积肥多、打粮食多，反过来又促进了农业和畜牧业更好地跃进的先进单位。山东栖霞县唐家沟公社就是一个鲜明的例子。这个公社过去猪少、肥缺、地薄、粮食产量低，年年靠国家供应粮食。公社化以来，这个公社紧紧抓住了养猪积肥这个重要的增产措施，猪、肥料、粮食一直是成正比例地共同跃进。1957年这里只养了三千八百三十头猪，每亩平均施圈肥六百多斤，半数土地实际上不施肥，粮食亩产只有二百九十斤。1958年，猪增加到一万零二百二十八头，每亩平均施圈肥三千斤，粮食亩产跃增到四百六十七斤。1959年猪发展到一万五千三百头，每亩施圈肥五千一百斤，粮食亩产达到五百四十六斤。由于粮食产量年年大幅度的增加，生猪生产也发展很快。目前这个公社的生猪存栏数已达二万二千五百二十头，几乎等于公社化前的六倍。当然，粮食产量这样迅速增加，增施肥料并不是唯一的因素；但它是一个极为重要的因素，却是毫无疑义的。
    自从党中央发出大养其猪的号召以来，全国各地都在努力发展养猪生产。但是，有些单位虽然多养了猪，却没有相应地多积了肥料。唐家沟人民公社三叶大队的两个生产小队的情况，很能发人深思。两个小队的生产条件基本相同，养猪的平均数字也相等。第一小队非常注意多积肥，去年平均一头猪积厩肥二万多斤。第三小队没有建立积肥制度，肥料流失很多，去年平均一头猪只积肥七千斤。
    为什么有些单位多养了猪而没有多积了肥料呢？最重要的原因，在于养猪业的生产方式改变了，经营管理工作却没有跟上去。在个体经济时代，一家一户是一个生产单位，也是一个经营管理单位；凡是养猪的人家，都是先让它出粪，后让它出肉，积肥、出肉是统一的。在人民公社里，集体饲养成为养猪的主要方式，猪场由畜牧专业队管理。公社内部实行农业和畜牧业的合理分工，这是一大进步。但是，有些单位由于思想工作做得不深不透，又缺乏必要的制度来保证，他们的畜牧专业队的主要着眼点是养多少猪，出多少肉，而不是积多少肥料，有的饲养员忙于喂猪，不能经常垫圈积肥；有个别的地方为保持猪场的清洁卫生，把粪便“处理”掉了，而没有及时收集作为肥料。不少饲养单位没有坚持推行“以猪定肥、超额奖励”的制度。为了解决这个问题，一方面，应该进行广泛的宣传教育，使大家充分认识养猪积肥的重要性；一方面，要进一步改善经营管理制度，为养猪场规定两个指标：一个是养了多少猪，出了多少肉；一个是积了多少肥料。任何一个指标完不成，都不算是好的养猪场。
    改进猪场设备，改进积肥方法，是保证多积猪肥的有效措施。猪场的布局，既要便于饲养管理，又要便于积肥、运肥。要提倡就地建场，就地积肥、施肥，尽可能在丰产方、低产田附近建立猪场，以便节约运肥劳力。养猪应该有圈，猪圈要有不渗透、不流失猪尿的栏底，要有蓄存粪尿的肥坑。有条件的地方，最好修造硬栏（三合土或石头铺底），硬栏积的肥料又多（比软栏多50％至一倍），质量又好，还便于打扫冲洗，保持猪圈的清洁卫生。勤垫圈、勤扫圈、勤出粪的先进积肥方法应该普遍推广。有些地区习惯采用放牧方法养猪，要注意收集肥料，不使散失。要向饲养员进行深入的教育，使他们充分认识养猪积肥的重要意义，把养猪场办成公社和生产队的最可靠的肥料库。要进一步健全养猪积肥的制度，把养猪、积肥的任务同时落实到饲养场，分季、分月规定积肥定额，定期评比检查，按照制度给以奖励。有些社员家庭养了猪，要采取记工分或付现金的办法，鼓励他们多积肥料交生产队使用。许多地区的经验证明，只要坚持政治挂帅，向群众大讲养猪必须注意多积肥的道理，大讲积肥对于贯彻实行国民经济以农业为基础方针的重大意义，大家动起手来，完全可以在迅速发展养猪生产的同时，积造大量猪肥，促进农业生产的连续跃进。
