Ensure Labor Force Needed for Agricultural Production, Considering Diversified Operations for All-Round Development
Baoshan Concentrates Superior Labor Force to Persist in Field Production Year-Round
Permanently fixes half of the labor force to engage in agricultural production; the remaining 30% forms a mobile team, participating in agricultural production during busy farming seasons and engaging in diversified operations during slack seasons; the labor force in community-run industries and welfare undertakings is controlled within 20%.

Kunming, September 4th (This Newspaper) – Baoshan County, Yunnan Province, uses 50% of its labor force to form a fixed agricultural basic team, engaging in agricultural production year-round; it uses 30% of its labor force to form a mobile team, flexibly deploying it according to the needs of the farming season. During slack seasons, they engage in water conservancy construction and diversified operations; during busy farming seasons, they concentrate on the fields. These two teams ensure that during the busiest times of agricultural production, over 80% of the labor force is concentrated in the fields, 70% during medium busy times, and 50% during less busy times, while also ensuring the progress of basic farmland construction and diversified operations.

This experience in arranging the labor force was summarized from the practice of the Shaba Management Area of the Banqiao Commune. The Shaba Management Area has over 1,200 laborers. Last year, it fixed over 610 laborers to specialize in field management, forming a total of 50 field management work groups, which were not allowed to be drawn from at any time. In addition, during the mid-cultivation and weeding of major spring crops, another 15% of the mobile force was deployed to participate. During the busy seasons such as autumn harvest and autumn planting, 80% of the labor force was concentrated for a shock attack. After arranging the labor force according to this principle, all aspects of production in the entire management area were carried out very well.

Why does fixing 50% of the labor force to engage in field production have such a huge effect on production? The Baoshan County Committee of the Communist Party of China summarized four major benefits: First, the production responsibility system is implemented. The cycle of agricultural production is long, and each process must be tightly linked. Relaxing one link will affect the overall production. After implementing the production responsibility system, commune members can see the next step as they take each step, ensuring that each process is completed with quality and quantity. The Wayao Management Area of the Wayao Commune conscientiously implemented the production responsibility system, which fully mobilized the initiative and enthusiasm of commune members, completing every task with quality and quantity. Last year's grain production was high, and this year's crops are growing even better than last year. The second benefit is that it is easier to implement the Eight-Point Charter for Agriculture in accordance with local conditions. The soil and climate in Baoshan County are very complex, and each plot of land has its own temperament and characteristics. After the labor force is fixed, commune members can become familiar with the habits of the land and find out the rules for the density of planting, the amount of fertilizer, and the timing of fertilization required by various types of land, so that advanced yield-increasing measures can be combined with adapting to local conditions to maximize their effectiveness. After establishing year-round field management work groups throughout the county, they found ways to control special soils such as "leaky sand fields," "dirty water fields," and "sick fields." This year, the three types of seedlings decreased by nearly half compared to the same period last year. The third benefit is that production team leaders generally find it easier to lead. Whether a production team leader can manage well depends largely on whether they are good at arranging the labor force. Now that 50% of the labor force is fixed, production team leaders can easily grasp the rules of labor arrangement, so they all feel that the team leader's work is smoother than in the past. The fourth benefit is that while fixing 50% of the labor force to engage in field production, another 30% of the labor force forms a mobile team. This mobile team, when field production is tight, is fixed in the work group to participate in the shock attack. During the slack season, they are drawn out and formed into specialized groups to engage in basic farmland construction and diversified operations with peace of mind, without "worries" or "losing sight of one thing while attending to another."

How can 50% of the labor force be fixed? The production teams in Baoshan County first conducted a general survey of labor force usage. After the survey was clear, more than 24,000 laborers were transferred from all fronts to the production teams, so that the labor force in community-run industries, animal husbandry, and welfare undertakings was controlled within 20%, and 80% of the labor force was used in agricultural production. Among them, 50% of the county's labor force was fixed to form a year-round field production team. After the year-round labor force was fixed, each commune and management area used the production team as a unit, allocating land according to the distance, early or late seasons, difficulty of work, and crop varieties. They allocated backbones according to the number of party members, league members and activists, and mixed and compiled work groups according to the strength of the labor force. In order to make this organization permanently fixed, each team also implemented a responsibility system of "three guarantees" and "five fixings." "Three guarantees" means guaranteeing work points, guaranteeing management area, and guaranteeing the quantity and quality of task completion; "Five fixings" means fixing leaders, fixing labor, fixing time, fixing measures, and fixing rewards and punishments. With the implementation of these systems, every plot has its soldier, every piece has its general, and responsibility is taken from planting to harvest. In addition, in order to ensure that this fixed team is not impacted, in organizing necessary production cooperation, adjustments are only made from the mobile team, without affecting the fixed team.

As for the mobile team, which accounts for 30% of the labor force, it still focuses on grain production. These laborers are still relatively fixed according to the land and are not organized into separate teams. They are usually arranged in fixed work groups and only form specialized groups when mobilized for outside work. After returning from the shock attack, they still participate in the production of the original group. For example, during the busy season of summer harvest and summer planting this year, all the mobile forces of the Shenguantun and other production teams were transferred back to participate in the rush harvest and rush planting, so that the entire team completed the planting task one season ahead of schedule with quality and quantity. This year, a large area of rice fields suffered from planthopper disasters and droughts, and the mobile team was transferred back from all fronts to participate in the fixed work group and jointly extinguish the disasters.

As a result of Baoshan County's arrangement of the labor force, grain and other production this year have been very successful. Under the severe drought of eight months without heavy rain, the county still completed the planting of 350,000 mu of basic farmland one season ahead of the original plan; after the planting was completed, because 50% of the labor force was fixed in the field, there was a relatively complete organization for the processing and management of crops, and this year's mid-cultivation and summer hoeing were carried out quickly and well. The county's more than 2,000 production teams also used the mobile team to reclaim wasteland and expand planting of 160,000 mu of late autumn crops; this year's sideline income in the first half of the year was more than half of the total last year, and animal husbandry, forestry, and county and commune industries have also been developed accordingly.

    确保农业生产所需劳力　兼顾多种经营全面发展
    保山集中优势劳力常年坚持田间生产
    常年固定半数劳力从事农业生产；其余30％组成机动队伍，农忙时参加农业生产，
    农闲时搞多种经营；社办工业和生活福利事业等方面的劳力则控制在20％以内。
    本报昆明4日电　云南省保山县以50％的劳力组成固定的农业基本队伍，常年从事农业生产；以30％的劳动力组成机动队伍，根据农事季节的需要灵活调配，在农闲时修水利、开展多种经营等活动，农忙时则集中到田间。这两套队伍既保证了农业生产上在大忙时有80％以上的劳动力、中忙时有70％的劳动力、小忙时有50％的劳动力集中在田间，又保证了农田基本建设和多种经营的进行。
    这两套安排劳动力的经验是从板桥公社沙坝管理区的实践中总结出来的。沙坝管理区有一千二百多个劳动力，去年就固定了六百一十多个劳动力专门进行田间管理，共组成了五十个田间管理作业组，在任何时候不准抽调。此外，在大春作物中耕、薅锄期间，另调15％的机动力量参加。在秋收秋种等大忙季节，则集中80％的劳动力进行突击。按照这个原则安排劳动力以后，全管理区的各项生产搞得很好。
    为什么固定50％的劳动力从事田间生产以后，会在生产上发挥这么巨大的作用？中共保山县委总结有四大好处：首先是生产责任制得到贯彻执行。农业生产的周期长，各道工序之间要环环扣紧，一环放松就会影响全盘生产。贯彻了生产责任制以后，社员走上步就看到下步，保证道道工序按质按量完成。瓦窑公社瓦窑管理区认真贯彻了生产责任制，使社员的主动性和积极性得到充分发挥，样样活计按质按量完成，去年粮食获得高产，今年的庄稼长得比去年还要好。第二个好处是，便于因地制宜贯彻农业八字宪法。保山县的土壤、气候都很复杂，每丘田有每丘田的脾气和特性。劳动力固定以后，就能使社员熟悉土地的习性，摸出各种土地需要的密植程度、施肥量及施肥时间等规律，使先进的增产措施和因地制宜相结合，发挥最大的效果。全县在建立了常年的田间管理作业组后，分别找到了治服“漏沙田”、
  “脏水田”、“痨病倌田”等特殊土壤的办法，今年的三类苗比去年同期减少了将近一半。第三个好处是，生产队长普遍反映好领导了。生产队长会不会当家，很重要一条是善不善于安排劳动力。现在固定了50％的劳动力，生产队长易于掌握劳动力安排的规律，因此都觉得队长的工作比过去顺当了。第四个好处是，在固定50％的劳动力搞田间生产的同时，又有30％的劳动力组成了机动队伍。这支机动队伍在田间生产紧张时，就固定在作业组内参加突击，农闲时就抽出来另外编成专业组，安心从事农田基本建设和开展多种经营，而无“后顾之忧”，也不致“顾此失彼”。
    如何能够把50％的劳动力固定下来？保山县各生产队首先把劳动力使用情况进行一次普查。在普查清楚以后，从各条战线调集出两万四千多劳动力输送到生产队去，使社办工业、畜牧业、生活福利等方面的劳动力控制在20％以内，保持80％的劳动力用在农业生产上。其中又把占全县50％的劳动力固定下来，组成常年性的田间生产队伍。在常年的劳动力固定以后，各公社、管理区就以生产队为单位，根据土地远近、节令早迟、活路难易和作物品种来搭配土地，根据党团员和积极分子多少搭配骨干，根据劳动力强弱混合编成作业组。为了使这套组织能够常年固定下来，各队还实行了“三包”、“五定”的责任制。“三包”就是包工分、包管理面积、包完成任务的数量质量；“五定”就是定领导、定劳力、定时间、定措施、定奖惩。实行了这些制度，就做到丘丘有兵、片片有将，从种到收，负责到底。此外，为了保证这支固定队伍不受冲击，在组织必要的生产协作时，只从机动队伍中去调整，不牵动固定队伍。
    至于占劳动力30％的机动队伍，仍以粮食生产为主，这些劳动力仍然按田地相对固定，并不单独编队。他们平时被安排在固定的作业组内，只在机动外出时另编专业组，突击回来后仍参加原组内生产。如在今年夏收夏种的大忙季节，沈官屯等生产队的机动力量全部调回参加抢收抢种，使全队提前一个节令按质按量完成了栽插任务。今年稻田发生了大面积粘虫灾害和旱灾，机动队伍又从各个战线上调回来，参加固定作业组，共同扑灭灾害。
    保山县把劳动力这样进行安排的结果，今年粮食和其它各项生产都搞得很出色。在八个月未下透雨的大旱下，全县仍比原计划提前一个节令完成了三十五万亩基本农田的栽插；栽插结束，由于有50％的劳动力固定在田间，对农作物的加工管理有一套比较完整的组织，今年的中耕夏锄进行得又快又好。全县的两千多个生产队还运用机动队伍，开荒扩种了十六万亩晚秋作物；今年上半年的副业收入比去年全年还多一半，畜牧业、林业和县、社工业也都得到了相应的发展。
