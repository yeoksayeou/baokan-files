The China Peace Committee and Seven Other Organizations Send Telegrams to the Congolese Government and Mass Organizations
Resolutely Support the Congolese People's Struggle to Safeguard National Independence Angrily Condemn the U.S. Imperialist Conspiracy to Engulf the Congo
Liu Changsheng, President of the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace, the Chinese-African People's Solidarity Committee, the Chinese-African People's Friendship Association, the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, the All-China Youth Federation, the All-China Students' Federation, and the All-China Women's Federation, sent telegrams on the 14th respectively to Congolese Republic Prime Minister Lumumba and Congolese mass organizations, expressing resolute support for the Congolese government and people's heroic struggle against the U.S.-led imperialist aggression crimes, to defend national independence and territorial integrity, deeply believing that with the support of the people of the world, the Congolese people will unite closely, persist in the struggle, and will surely be able to shatter all imperialist aggressive conspiracies and achieve final victory.

Xinhua News Agency, September 15th: The China Peace Committee sent a telegram on the 14th to Congolese Republic Prime Minister Lumumba, stating that the 650 million Chinese people resolutely support the Congolese people's just struggle against imperialism, to defend national independence and territorial integrity. The telegram expressed deep belief that as long as the heroic Congolese people strengthen their unity and continue their struggle, they will surely be able to eliminate Belgian colonial forces and defeat all aggression and interference by U.S.-led imperialism, achieving a complete victory.

The China Peace Committee telegram stated: "The China Peace Committee extends its highest respect to the Congolese people who are heroically struggling against imperialist aggression.

"The U.S.-led imperialists, under the banner of the United Nations, are carrying out armed intervention and aggression against the Congo, which not only openly undermines the Congo's independence and sovereignty but also seriously threatens world peace. This serious crime has aroused strong opposition and condemnation from the people of the world. Developments increasingly show that U.S. imperialism is painstakingly carrying out a conspiracy to engulf the Congo, proving once again that it is an enemy of peace and the most dangerous and ferocious common enemy of the Congolese people, the African people, and the people of the world.

"The 650 million Chinese people resolutely support the Congolese people's just struggle against imperialism, to defend national independence and territorial integrity. The affairs of the Congo should be managed by the Congolese people themselves, and imperialism must not be allowed to interfere in any name or in any way.

"Peace-loving people all over the world stand on the side of the Congolese people. We firmly believe that as long as the heroic Congolese people strengthen their unity and continue their struggle, they will surely be able to eliminate Belgian colonial forces and defeat all aggression and interference by U.S.-led imperialism and achieve complete victory."

The China-Africa Solidarity Committee's Telegram

Xinhua News Agency, September 15th: The China-Africa Solidarity Committee sent a telegram on the 14th to Congolese Republic Prime Minister Lumumba, resolutely supporting him and the Congolese people's just struggle to defend national independence, sovereignty, and oppose U.S.-led imperialist aggression and interference.

The China-Africa Solidarity Committee telegram stated: "On behalf of all the Chinese people, the China-Africa Solidarity Committee extends warm fraternal greetings to Your Excellency the Prime Minister and to the Congolese people who are heroically struggling to defend national independence, sovereignty, and oppose imperialist aggression.

"The U.S.-led imperialist bloc, using the banner of the United Nations, is carrying out armed intervention and aggression against the Congolese Republic and its people, and is also attempting to further oppress and enslave the Congolese and African people by undermining the internal unity of the Congolese and African people. This not only directly undermines the Congo's independence and unity but also seriously threatens the common cause of the people of Africa and Asia to strive for and safeguard national independence, and endangers world peace.

"The Chinese people solemnly condemn and strongly protest the criminal acts of the U.S.-led imperialist bloc. The 650 million Chinese people deeply sympathize with and resolutely support the Congolese people's patriotic and just struggle against imperialist aggression and interference, to defend national independence, sovereignty, and territorial integrity. We believe that the Congolese central government is the only legitimate government of the Congo and has the sacred right to manage its own national affairs. We resolutely demand that imperialism immediately cease all interference and aggression against the Congo, and that all imperialist forces must immediately get out of the Congo.

"The Chinese people firmly believe that with the support and encouragement of the unprecedentedly high tide of anti-imperialist struggles of the people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America, and the powerful world peace forces, as long as the Congolese people persist in their struggle, strengthen their unity, and remain vigilant, they will surely be able to completely shatter all imperialist aggressive conspiracies, thereby achieving final and glorious victory."

The China-Africa People's Friendship Association's Telegram

Xinhua News Agency, September 15th: Liu Changsheng, President of the China-Africa People's Friendship Association, sent a telegram on the 14th to Congolese Republic Prime Minister Lumumba, supporting Prime Minister Lumumba, the Congolese central government, the Congolese army, and the Congolese people in their heroic and tenacious struggle to defend the independence and territorial sovereignty of their motherland. In his telegram, Liu Changsheng also strongly protested the U.S.-led imperialists' extremely tyrannical interference in the Congo's internal affairs under the banner of the United Nations, their attempt to subvert the Congolese central government, and their vicious conspiracy to implement military occupation of the Congo in order to engulf it.

The full text of Liu Changsheng's telegram to Prime Minister Lumumba is as follows:

"The heroic Congolese army and people, under your leadership and that of the Congolese central government, are waging a heroic and tenacious struggle to defend the independence and territorial sovereignty of their motherland. The Chinese people extend to you, and through you to the fraternal Congolese people, our highest respect!

"The U.S.-led imperialists, under the banner of the United Nations, are extremely tyrannically interfering in the Congo's internal affairs, opposing the Congo's only legitimate central government, infringing upon the integrity of the Congo's territorial sovereignty, and playing the vicious conspiracy of 'Congolese fighting Congolese, Africans fighting Africans,' attempting to subvert the Congolese central government, implement military occupation of the Congo, and achieve the goal of engulfing the Congo. The Chinese people are extremely indignant and strongly protest the criminal acts of the U.S.-led imperialists! We resolutely demand that the U.S.-led imperialists immediately cease their interference and aggression against the Congolese Republic! The affairs of the Congo must be managed by the Congolese people themselves!

"The Congolese people's just struggle is not only of great historical significance for defending the Congo's national independence and maintaining its territorial sovereignty but also has a huge promoting effect on the entire African people to further unite, completely shatter all imperialist conspiracies, and destroy imperialist colonial rule in Africa.

"The 650 million Chinese people resolutely stand on the side of the Congolese people and fully support the Congolese people's just struggle! We firmly believe that with the support of the people of the world, the Congolese people will unite closely, persist in their struggle, and will surely be able to shatter the imperialist offensive and achieve complete victory!"

The All-China Federation of Trade Unions' Telegram

Xinhua News Agency, September 15th: The All-China Federation of Trade Unions sent a telegram on the 14th to the Congolese National Workers' Union and the Congolese workers, angrily condemning the U.S. imperialists and the "United Nations forces" under their control for their banditry in the Congo, and expressing resolute support for the Congolese workers and people's patriotic and just struggle to safeguard national independence, national unity, and resist the aggression and interference of U.S.-led imperialism.

The All-China Federation of Trade Unions' telegram stated: "The heroic Congolese people have achieved national independence after a arduous struggle. The Belgian colonialists are unwilling to accept their defeat and have brazenly launched an aggression against the Congolese Republic. And U.S. imperialism, under the banner of the United Nations, has taken the opportunity to invade your country under the guise of 'aid.' It openly supports the colonialists, rudely interferes in the internal affairs of the Congolese Republic, occupies all the Congo's airports and the capital's radio station, and uses despicable means to attempt to overthrow the legitimate government of the Congolese Republic, plotting to divide the Congo, to make Congolese fight Congolese, Africans fight Africans, so that they can carry out military occupation of the Congo. This series of facts proves that the United Nations, controlled by the United States, is playing a colonialist role in the Congo. It also further proves that U.S. imperialism is the most ferocious enemy of the Congolese people, the African people, and the people of the world.

"The Chinese workers and people condemn with unparalleled anger the U.S. imperialists and the 'United Nations forces' under their control for their banditry in the Congo. We deeply sympathize with and resolutely support the Congolese workers and people's patriotic and just struggle to safeguard their national independence and territorial integrity, and to resist the aggression and interference of U.S.-led imperialism. We firmly believe that the Congolese workers and people, with their glorious tradition of struggle, will unite as one, persist in their struggle, and, with the support of the African people and the people of the world, will surely be able to defeat imperialism and colonialism and achieve the complete victory of national independence."

The All-China Youth Federation and the All-China Students' Federation's Telegram

Xinhua News Agency, September 15th: The All-China Youth Federation and the All-China Students' Federation jointly sent a telegram on the 14th to the African Solidarity Party Youth, the Congolese Communist Youth, the African Youth League, the African People's Party Youth, the Kivu Lake Democratic Union Youth, the Congolese Youth Union, the Lulua-Frères Youth League, the Congolese National Movement Party Youth, and the Congolese Youth Opinion Organization, stating that the 130 million Chinese youth and students, together with all the Chinese people, resolutely support the Congolese people's just struggle to safeguard national independence and national unity, and angrily condemn the joint suppression and interference by U.S.-led imperialism in the Congolese national independence movement.

The telegram from the All-China Youth Federation and the All-China Students' Federation stated: "The great African people of all ethnic groups are one after another throwing off the shackles of colonialism, burying the evil imperialist and colonialist systems, and becoming masters of the African continent once again. Imperialism and colonialism are unwilling to accept their defeat and are using all kinds of conspiracies and tricks to try to maintain or restore their colonial rule. U.S. imperialism is doing everything possible to break into Africa, trying to replace the position of the old-brand imperialism. Recently, U.S. imperialism, under the banner of the United Nations, has implemented the vicious trick of using Africans to fight Africans, armed interference in the Congo's internal affairs, infringement of the Congo's sovereignty, and its barbaric attempt to engulf the Congo, has once again exposed to the people of the world that U.S. imperialism is the most ferocious enemy of the African national independence movement, and is the most ferocious and dangerous enemy of the African people and the people of the world.

"The Congolese people's just struggle against the aggression and interference of the U.S.-led imperialists is not isolated. The sympathy and support of the people of the world are on your side. We firmly believe that the Congolese people and youth, who have a glorious tradition of fighting for national independence, under the leadership of the Congolese central government - the Congo's only legitimate government, uniting as one and persisting in their struggle, will surely overcome difficulties, shatter the divisive conspiracies of imperialism and its running dogs, defeat the armed aggression and interference by U.S.-led imperialism in any name and in any way, safeguard the independence of their motherland, and maintain the integrity of the territorial sovereignty of the Congolese Republic.

"Victory belongs to the heroic Congolese people!"

The All-China Women's Federation's Telegram

Xinhua News Agency, September 15th: The All-China Women's Federation sent a telegram on the 14th to the Congolese National Workers' Union and the Congolese women, severely condemning the joint suppression and interference by imperialism, headed by U.S. imperialism, in the Congolese national independence movement, and expressing complete support for the Congolese people's just struggle against imperialism, to safeguard national independence and national unity.

The telegram from the All-China Women's Federation stated: "The hundreds of millions of Chinese women feel unparalleled anger at the series of evil conspiracies of U.S. imperialism, under the cover of the United Nations flag, to invade the Congo on a large scale, to barbarously infringe upon the Congo's territorial sovereignty, to interfere in the Congo's internal affairs, to forcibly occupy the Congo's airports and national radio stations, and to protect the Belgian colonialists and the Congolese secessionist groups. We express our highest respect to the Congolese brothers and sisters who are heroically struggling against imperialism and colonialism. We severely condemn the joint suppression and interference by imperialism, headed by U.S. imperialism, in the Congolese national independence movement. We fully support the Congolese people's just struggle to oppose interference in internal affairs, to demand that the 'United Nations forces' withdraw from the Congo, and to defend the independence of their motherland and maintain the integrity of their territorial sovereignty.

"The wolfish ambition of U.S. imperialism to engulf the Congo not only seriously undermines the Congo's independence and peace but also seriously threatens the entire African national independence movement. Facts prove that U.S. imperialism is the common enemy of all African people who are striving for national independence and love peace. The Congolese brothers and sisters have already stood up strongly and are closely united around the Congolese central government, resolutely fighting to safeguard national independence and freedom. Your just struggle will surely win the sympathy and support of the African people and the people of the world. We firmly believe that you will certainly be able to overcome all difficulties and win the final victory."
