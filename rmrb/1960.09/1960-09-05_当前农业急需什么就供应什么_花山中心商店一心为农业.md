Supplying Whatever Agriculture Urgently Needs
Huashan Central Store Serves Agriculture Wholeheartedly

(Our newspaper, Wuhan, 4th) The Wuhan City suburban Huashan Central Store, a red banner unit in Wuhan City for supporting agriculture, is actively focusing on the current needs of agricultural production and doing a good job in support work.

Recently, Wuhan has experienced high temperatures and no rain. Under the leadership of the Wuhan Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, people in suburban counties (districts) have launched a drought resistance struggle; all employees of the Huashan Store are also actively serving the drought resistance effort. They organized professional teams to implement technology to the fields, transportation to the fields, purchasing and sales services to the fields, and living services to the fields, going deep to serve drought resistance. Before the drought appeared, the store's employees were already running around, trying every means to organize the supplies needed for drought resistance. They successively organized more than 30 types of materials and equipment, making the pumps and other drought-resistant tools "complete sets." The store's drought-resistant tool repair team went deep into the drought-resistant sites to carry out mobile repair activities, ensuring the normal operation of the water-lifting tools of each production team. The fuel injector of a water pump in the Rocket Production Team malfunctioned, and the members were very anxious. The repair team rushed to the site immediately, inspected and repaired it, replaced the fuel injector, and quickly made the water pump start pumping water again. In the drought resistance struggle, the store's salesmen and service personnel participated in labor while enthusiastically serving the commune members. For example, they provided haircuts for the members in the fields, supplied medicines, and delivered self-made soda, jujube soup, and other cool drinks to the members, providing them with heat protection and quenching their thirst, greatly encouraging the members' enthusiasm.

In the mass movement to strive for late rice to surpass early rice, the secretary of the Huashan Store's Party branch led employees to go to the production teams to understand the key issues that needed to be resolved for late rice to surpass early rice. They found that some late rice seedlings were fertile and some were thin, so they transported more than 270,000 jin of chemical fertilizer from the warehouse to the production teams and assisted the production teams in mobilizing the masses to ferment a large amount of native chemical fertilizer. The late rice seedlings grew vigorously after topdressing and were a lush green.

Recently, the production teams of the communes in the Wuhan suburbs are taking advantage of this great opportunity of wasteland reclamation and seizing the time to plant in late summer and early autumn, marching towards the wasteland. In order to fully supply the tools needed for wasteland reclamation, the Huashan Store promptly sent people to organize sources of goods. They raided the purchase of a batch of scrap iron and old hardware, commissioned farm tool factories to process them locally, made more than 700 hoes, and purchased more than 180 various types of walking plows, and quickly delivered these tools to the wasteland reclamation sites, powerfully supporting the suburban communes' wasteland reclamation and rush planting of late autumn crops.

    当前农业急需什么就供应什么
    花山中心商店一心为农业
    本报武汉4日电　武汉市支援农业的红旗单位——武汉市郊区花山中心商店，积极围绕当前农业生产需要，做好支援工作。
    近来，武汉地区高温无雨。市郊各县（区）人民在中共武汉市委的领导下，展开了抗旱斗争；花山商店全体职工也积极为抗旱服务。他们组织专业队伍，实行技术到田、运输到田、购销到田、生活服务到田，深入为抗旱服务。早在旱象出现以前，这个商店的职工就曾四出奔走，千方百计组织抗旱需用物品。他们先后组织到三十多宗物资和器材，使抽水机等抗旱工具“配套成龙”。这个商店的抗旱工具修配队，深入抗旱现场，开展巡回修理活动，保证了各生产队提水工具的正常运转。火箭生产队一台抽水机的喷油嘴发生故障，社员很焦急。修理队马上赶到，进行了检修，给换上喷油嘴，使这部抽水机很快便又抽起水来。在抗旱斗争中，这个商店的营业员、服务员，一面参加劳动，一面热情地为社员服务。如在田间为社员理发，供应药品，把自制的汽水、红枣汤等清凉饮料送到社员手里，给社员们避温解渴，大大鼓舞了社员们的干劲。
    在力争晚稻超早稻的群众运动中，花山商店党支部书记带领职工分头深入生产小队，了解晚稻超早稻需要解决的关键问题。他们发现晚稻禾苗有的肥、有的瘦，便一面将库存的二十七万多斤化肥运到各生产队，一面协助生产队发动群众沤制了大量的土化肥。追肥后的晚稻禾苗生长旺盛，一片油绿。
    最近，武汉郊区公社各生产队正乘夏末秋初这一开荒抢种的大好时机，向荒地进军。为了充分供应开荒所需工具，花山商店及时派人四出组织货源。他们突击收购了一批废铁、旧五金，委托农具厂就地加工，制成了七百多把锄头，同时购进了一百八十多部各式步犁，并把这些工具迅速送到开荒现场，有力地支援了郊区公社开荒和抢种晚秋作物。
