Xinhua News Agency, September 28th. U Nu, Prime Minister of the Union of Burma, our neighbor as close as kin, and his wife, along with the Burmese government delegation, arrived in Beijing this afternoon. Prime Minister U Nu, General Ne Win, other distinguished guests from the Burmese government delegation, the Burmese delegation to the Sino-Burmese Joint Boundary Committee, and Burmese military friendship, cultural, sports, news, and trade delegations, totaling more than 370 people, were greeted with a grand, solemn, and warm welcome by Premier Zhou Enlai and other leaders, as well as hundreds of thousands of people from all walks of life in the capital.

Prime Minister U Nu, General Ne Win, and the distinguished guests of the Burmese government delegation are visiting China at the invitation of Premier Zhou Enlai for a friendly visit and to celebrate the National Day holiday with the Chinese people. During this period, the governments of China and Burma will formally sign the historically significant Sino-Burmese Boundary Treaty. The Union of Burma sending more than 370 government and civilian representatives to participate in China's National Day celebrations at one time is not only an unprecedented event in the history of Sino-Burmese relations but also a rare grand occasion in the history of relations between countries around the world.

Premier Zhou Enlai and Prime Minister U Nu delivered written speeches at the Beijing airport, expressing their friendship. Premier Zhou Enlai said that the leaders of our two countries have repeatedly gathered together during festivals. This year, General Ne Win joined us in Beijing to celebrate the Chinese Spring Festival, and Vice Premier Chen Yi and I celebrated the Burmese Water Festival in Rangoon. Today, Prime Minister U Nu, General Ne Win, and more than 300 Burmese guests have come to Beijing to celebrate China's National Day with the Chinese people and will participate in the signing ceremony of the historically significant Sino-Burmese Boundary Treaty. The Chinese people are extremely happy. We firmly believe that through the friendly visit of Prime Minister U Nu and other Burmese guests to our country and the signing of the Sino-Burmese Boundary Treaty, the friendly and cooperative relations between our two countries, based on the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, will achieve even greater development on a new foundation and will make new contributions to consolidating peace in Asia and the world. Prime Minister U Nu said that we are here to celebrate the 11th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China with our Chinese friends, the founding of the People's Republic of China being a historically significant event. We are here to share with you the pride you should have in your brilliant achievements since that memorable event. At the same time, we are here to sign the Sino-Burmese Boundary Treaty. This is a historic event because it is the first time that the boundaries of our two countries have been fully demarcated by mutual agreement. But this event is more than just making history. It will consolidate and strengthen the friendship between the peoples of our two countries under the constant guidance of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence and will bring closer understanding and beneficial cooperation between our two countries.

Although Beijing was shrouded in autumn rain all day today, the "pauk-phaw" (fraternal) friendship between the Chinese and Burmese people made the whole city seethe with joy. Several hours before the arrival of the distinguished guests, hundreds of thousands of people braved the rain from all directions to flock to the airport and line the long road from Jianguomen to the guesthouse, waiting for the arrival of the guests. The airport was decorated with the national flags of China and Burma and rows of red flags, and a huge banner read: "Welcome to the Prime Minister of the Union of Burma, U Nu, the Chief of Staff of the Burmese Armed Forces, General Ne Win, and the Burmese Government Delegation!"

At 4:30 p.m., the special plane carrying Prime Minister U Nu and the distinguished guests of the Burmese government delegation landed. At this time, tens of thousands of welcomers waved the national flags of China and Burma, colorful flags, and bouquets, beating drums and gongs, applauding enthusiastically, shouting slogans, and singing songs of Sino-Burmese friendship. Premier Zhou Enlai stepped forward first to welcome Prime Minister U Nu and the Burmese guests, shaking hands warmly with them. Also welcoming the guests at the airport were: Vice Premier of the State Council He Long, Vice Premier Chen Yi and his wife, Vice Premier Li Xiannian, Vice Premier and Chief of General Staff of the Chinese People's Liberation Army Luo Ruiqing and his wife, Vice Premier Xi Zhongxun, Vice Chairmen of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress Shen Junru, Guo Moruo, Huang Yanpei, Chen Shutong, Cheng Qian, Panchen Erdeni Qoigyijabu, President of the Supreme People's Court Xie Juezai, Procurator-General of the Supreme People's Procuratorate Zhang Dingcheng, Vice Chairmen of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference Li Siguang, Burhan, Vice Chairmen of the National Defense Council Zhang Zhizhong, Fu Zuoyi, Vice Ministers of Foreign Affairs Zhang Hanfu, Geng Biao, and others.

After the band played the national anthems of Burma and China, Prime Minister U Nu, accompanied by Premier Zhou Enlai, reviewed the honor guard. Children of the capital presented flowers to Prime Minister U Nu, General Ne Win, and other Burmese guests. Then, Prime Minister U Nu, General Ne Win, and others met and shook hands with Chinese and foreign guests who came to welcome them. Among them were the responsible persons of various departments of the state organs, democratic parties, people's organizations, and Beijing Municipality, senior generals of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, well-known figures from all ethnic groups and circles, as well as the ambassadors and diplomatic officials of various countries to China.

Subsequently, Prime Minister U Nu and General Ne Win rode to the guesthouse with Premier Zhou Enlai, and all the Burmese guests followed in cars bearing the national flags of China and Burma. Along the long road from Jianguomen to the guesthouse, hundreds of thousands of people lined the streets to warmly welcome the guests. Along the way, flags were hung, colored flags were displayed, gongs and drums were played in unison, firecrackers were set off, and slogans were shouted continuously. When the guests arrived on the wide East and West Chang'an Avenue, it was nearly dusk, and the flower-shaped lampposts on both sides of the street shone brightly, forming two endless rows of brilliant lights. The magnificent buildings around Tiananmen Square were decorated with strings of lights, which were extremely magnificent and beautiful. When the guests arrived here, the square became an ocean full of friendship and joy. Songs, applause, and cheers resounded as one, and when the car circled in front of the welcoming crowd in the square, many young women carrying flower baskets scattered flower petals on the guests. Prime Minister U Nu and General Ne Win stood in the open car, smiling and waving frequently to the welcoming crowd. The Burmese guests were very touched to see that although the sky was raining heavily, the welcoming crowd was orderly and enthusiastic. Some of them reached out of the car window and clasped their hands to the crowd in salute, and some shouted "Friendship!" "Long live!" in Chinese.

Today, Li Yimang, the Chinese Ambassador to Burma, and Yu Peiwen, the Director of the Protocol Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, accompanied the guests to Beijing.

    周恩来总理和吴努总理在北京机场上发表了书面讲话，畅述友谊。周恩来总理说，我们两国领导人曾多次在节日欢聚在一起。今年，奈温将军阁下在北京同我们一起欢度了中国的春节，我和陈毅副总理在仰光欢度了缅甸的泼水节。今天，吴努总理阁下、奈温将军阁下和三百多位缅甸贵宾们前来北京同中国人民一起欢度我国的国庆节，并且将参加有历史意义的中缅边界条约的签字盛典。中国人民感到格外的高兴。我们深信，通过吴努总理阁下和其他缅甸贵宾们对我国的友好访问和中缅边界条约的签订，我们两国以和平共处五项原则为基础的友好合作关系，必将在新的基础上获得更加巨大的发展，并且将为巩固亚洲和世界和平作出新的贡献。吴努总理说，我们是来同我们的中国朋友一起庆祝中华人民共和国成立十一周年的，中华人民共和国的成立是具有历史意义的事件。我们是来和你们一起分享你们对你们的自从那次值得记忆的事件以来所取得的光辉成就所应有的骄傲。同时我们是来签订缅中边界条约的。这是一件将要创造历史的事件，因为这是我们两国的边界第一次经双方同意而被全部划定。但是这个事件还不仅仅是创造历史。它将在和平共处五项原则的不断指导下巩固和加强我们两国人民之间的友谊，并将带来我们两国之间更为紧密的谅解和有益的合作。
    北京今天虽然整日秋雨连绵，但中缅两国人民“胞波”般的友谊却使全城沸腾在欢乐中。在贵宾们到达以前几个小时，几十万群众就从四面八方冒雨涌向飞机场，涌向建国门到迎宾馆的很长的道路两旁，等候贵宾到来。机场上悬挂着中缅两国的国旗和成排的红旗，一幅巨大的横标上写着：“欢迎缅甸联邦吴努总理阁下、缅甸国防军总参谋长奈温将军阁下和缅甸政府代表团！”

    随后，吴努总理、奈温将军同周恩来总理一起乘车赴宾馆，所有缅甸贵宾都乘着挂有中缅两国国旗的汽车随行。在从建国门到迎宾馆的很长的道路上，数十万群众夹道热烈欢迎贵宾。一路上，悬旗结彩，锣鼓齐鸣，鞭炮轰响，口号声不绝于耳。贵宾们到达宽阔的东西长安大街的时候已近傍晚，大街两旁的花蕊形的灯柱大放光明，形成两道一眼望不到尽头的辉煌灯光。天安门广场周围的宏伟建筑物都被成串的电灯装饰起来，极为壮丽美观。当贵宾们到达这里的时候，广场上变成了充满着友谊和欢乐的海洋，歌声、掌声、欢呼声响成一片，汽车在广场上的欢迎群众面前绕行的时候，许多提着花篮的女青年把鲜花瓣撒到贵宾身上。吴努总理、奈温将军站在敞篷车上含笑频频向欢迎群众挥手答礼。缅甸贵宾们看到天空虽然落着大雨，但欢迎群众却井然有秩序，而且那样热情迸发，都非常感动，他们有的把手伸出车窗外，向群众合十致意，有的用中国话高呼：“友好！”“万岁！”
