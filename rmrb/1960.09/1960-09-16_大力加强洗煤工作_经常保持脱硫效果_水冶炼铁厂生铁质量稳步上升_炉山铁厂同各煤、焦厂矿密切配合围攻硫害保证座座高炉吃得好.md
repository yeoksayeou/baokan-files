　　Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou Telegram. Henan Province's Shuiye Iron Works focuses on both high production and high quality. It has formulated a set of rules and regulations to ensure quality, resulting in a steady rise in the quality of pig iron from small blast furnaces. In the first half of this year, the average qualified rate of pig iron in the entire plant reached 88.4%, and in the first twenty days of August, it further increased to 89.2%. This pig iron is supplied to the steelmaking and machinery industries, and has been consistently praised by users.

　　Improving the quality of furnace charge is an important measure taken by this plant to improve pig iron quality. The coking workshop strives to improve coke quality in every possible way to reduce the sulfur content in pig iron. They vigorously strengthen coal washing work, stipulating that raw coal must not be put into the furnace without washing and selection. They have also fully implemented new operating methods of skillful proportioning, hot charging, fine adjustment, and fast refining. Therefore, since the beginning of this year, the sulfur content of coke has consistently remained below 0.8%, meeting the required standards. To ensure that the blast furnace is well-fed, raw material workers ensure that the particle size of the raw materials entering the furnace is uniform, the grade is stable, and the quality is pure. They also consistently use quicklime as a flux, which greatly reduces the sulfur content of the raw materials and fuel entering the furnace, creating a prerequisite for improving pig iron quality.

　　In order to continuously consolidate and improve pig iron quality, in addition to systematically carrying out technical transformations of small blast furnaces and implementing high-wind, high-temperature operations, this plant has also established systems for raw material management, charging, slagging, air supply, external desulfurization, and testing. For example, they stipulate that the slag basicity of the blast furnace must be controlled between 1 and 1.15, and if slag ratio fluctuations are found during production, measures must be taken in time to adjust it, so that the blast furnace can consistently maintain good desulfurization efficiency. They also stipulate that off-grade iron is not allowed to leave the factory, and pig iron with a sulfur content of more than 0.25% is not allowed to leave the workshop. In this way, from raw materials and operation to finished products, desulfurization is carried out everywhere, and checks are set up at every stage, which powerfully guarantees the improvement of pig iron quality.

　　Leading cadres going deep into the front line to create experience and promote the general, is another important measure taken by this plant to improve pig iron quality. In order to create experience in high-quality and high-yield small blast furnaces, from October 1958, the plant party committee decided to use No. 2 blast furnace as the plant's experimental furnace. Party committee secretary Shan Fengyuan and other leading cadres and technicians often went to No. 2 blast furnace to work alongside the workers, focusing on ideology, unifying the operations of the three shifts, grasping technical transformation, and summarizing production experience. In particular, they helped the workers summarize a set of advanced operating methods to ensure smooth furnace conditions: four stabilities (stable chemical composition of raw materials and fuel, stable charging system, stable slagging system, stable air supply system). This allowed the qualified rate of pig iron from this blast furnace to consistently remain above 95% from the fourth quarter of last year to the present, with first-grade products accounting for more than 50%, and a utilization coefficient of more than 1.8, realizing continuous high quality and high yield. While the plant party committee was creating experience in No. 2 blast furnace, it launched a competition throughout the plant, mobilizing all employees to learn from, compare with, catch up with, and surpass No. 2 blast furnace, thereby promoting the overall improvement of pig iron quality and output in the entire plant. After seriously studying and promoting the "four stabilities" operating method, the qualified rate of pig iron in No. 3 and No. 6 blast furnaces has increased to more than 90% in the first half of this year, and the utilization coefficient has also reached 1.55 and 1.61 respectively.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Guiyang Telegram. Employees of the Lushan Iron Works in the Qiandongnan Miao and Dong Autonomous Prefecture of Guizhou Province closely cooperate with various raw material and fuel factories and mines, dividing labor and guarding passes, besieging high sulfur, so that the sulfur content of pig iron has rapidly decreased.

　　Since the beginning of this year, the employees of the Lushan Iron Works have successively promoted a set of effective internal and external desulfurization experiences such as making high-basicity slag, so that the sulfur content of pig iron has continued to decline. However, because the local coke and iron ore used for ironmaking have a high sulfur content, this still brings some difficulties to ironmaking desulfurization. At the beginning of August, the Autonomous Prefecture Party Committee, in response to this problem, organized the employees of the factories and mines supplying coal, coke, and ore to this iron works to jointly attack high sulfur, calling on the employees of iron, coal, coke, and mining units to be of one heart and one mind, divide labor and guard passes, besiege sulfur harm, and jointly strive for high-quality and high-yield steel. According to the requirements of the Prefecture Party Committee, the various coal and coke factories and mines mainly guarded the three passes of washing, selection, and refining. The mines guarded the two passes of ore forging and selection; the iron works guarded the raw materials and fuel entering the furnace and the internal and external desulfurization passes. Each factory and mine formulated desulfurization targets. In this way, the entire process of pig iron production formed a "dragon" in which each link is connected to the next, and each pass attacks sulfur harm.

　　Each factory and mine organized the masses of employees to offer suggestions and plans, sum up experience, and vigorously promote various effective desulfurization methods according to their own tasks. Ren Xianfeng, secretary of the Yudong Coal Mine Party Committee, went deep into the front line of production, concentrated the wisdom of the masses, and summarized the "six separations and three selections" method of layered, divided, transported, washed, loaded, and refined, as well as in-well selection, transport selection, and crushing selection, which increased the coking rate of refined coal by 20%, and the sulfur content of coke was reduced by 40% compared with the original. The Lianhuashan Iron Mine established a set of ore selection and forging system, strengthened the forging and selection work, so that the sulfur content of ore dropped to below 0.7%. The Lushan Iron Works, in order to further strengthen the internal desulfurization work, organized sulfur attack research groups in the smelting and power workshops. The power workshop is responsible for supplying large air volume and high air temperature to achieve intensified smelting and improve desulfurization effect; the smelting workshop is responsible for desulfurization before and after the furnace. They promoted a series of advanced experiences, so that the desulfurization effect of pig iron generally reached 40% to 50%.

　　The employees of various factories and mines, focusing on improving the quality of pig iron, continued to carry out technical innovation and technical revolution movements. The employees of Kaili Coal Mine successfully used mountain water to conduct hydraulic production from coal washing and transportation to kiln loading and coking. The ash content of raw coal was greatly reduced, and the sulfur content of coke decreased from 3% in the past to 1.3% to 1.5%, and the coking rate of refined coal increased from 50% to 60% to 75%. The employees of Lianhuashan Iron Mine actively promoted the advanced experience of the "one-dragon" ore forging in the Sua Sua kiln, which increased the ore grade from about 40% to about 60%, and also greatly increased the output of clinker, ensuring that every blast furnace eats good ore.

    大力加强洗煤工作  经常保持脱硫效果
    水冶炼铁厂生铁质量稳步上升
    炉山铁厂同各煤、焦厂矿密切配合围攻硫害保证座座高炉吃得好
    新华社郑州电　河南省水冶炼铁厂一手抓高产、一手抓优质，制定了一套保证质量的规章制度，使小高炉的生铁质量稳步上升。今年上半年，全厂生铁合格率平均达到88.4％，8月份前二十天又提高到89.2％。这些生铁供应炼钢、机械工业部门，获得了使用单位的一致好评。 
    提高炉料的质量，是这个厂提高生铁质量的一项重要措施。焦化车间为了降低生铁中的含硫量，就千方百计提高焦炭质量。他们大力加强洗煤工作，规定原煤不经洗选不准入炉，并且全面推行了巧配、热装、细调、快炼的新操作方法，因此今年以来，焦炭含硫量经常保持在0.8％以下，合乎规定标准。为使高炉吃饱吃好，原料工人作到了入炉原料粒度均匀、品位稳定、质量纯净，并且始终坚持用生石灰作熔剂，这样就大大减少了入炉原料、燃料的含硫量，为提高生铁质量创造了前提。
    为了不断地巩固和提高生铁质量，这个厂除了有计划地进行小高炉技术改造，实行大风、高温操作外，还先后建立了原料管理、布料、造渣、送风、炉外脱硫、化验等制度。如他们规定高炉渣碱度必须控制在一至一点一五，在生产中如发现渣比波动要及时采取措施调整，使高炉经常保持良好的脱硫效能。他们还规定等外铁不准出厂、含硫在0.25％以上的生铁不准出车间等。这样从原料、操作一直到成品，作到了处处脱硫、关关设卡，有力地保证了生铁质量的提高。
    领导干部深入第一线创造经验、推动一般，是这个厂提高生铁质量又一重要措施。为了创造小高炉优质高产经验，从1958年10月份起，厂党委就决定把二号高炉作为全厂的试验炉，党委书记单凤元等领导干部和技术人员经常到二号高炉跟班劳动，抓思想、抓三班操作统一、抓技术改造、抓总结生产经验。特别是帮助工人总结出一套保证炉况顺行的四稳定（稳定原料燃料的化学成份、稳定装料制度、稳定造渣制度、稳定送风制度）的先进操作方法，使这个高炉从去年四季度到现在，生铁合格率经常保持在95％以上，其中一级品占50％以上，利用系数达到一点八以上，实现了持续优质高产。厂党委一面在二号高炉创造经验，一面发动全厂职工掀起学、比、赶、超二号高炉的竞赛热潮，从而推动了全厂生铁质量和产量的全面提高。三号和六号高炉认真学习和推广了“四稳定”操作法以后，今年上半年生铁合格率都已提高到90％以上，利用系数也分别达到一点五五和一点六一。
    新华社贵阳电　贵州省黔东南苗族侗族自治州炉山铁厂职工同各原料、燃料厂矿密切配合，分工把关，围攻高硫，使生铁含硫量迅速下降。
    炉山铁厂职工今年以来曾先后推广了造高碱渣等一套行之有效的炉内外脱硫经验，使生铁含硫量不断下降。但是由于炼铁的土焦、铁矿含硫高，仍给炼铁脱硫带来一些困难。8月初，自治州党委针对这一问题，组织给这个铁厂供应煤、焦、矿石等厂矿职工同攻高硫，号召铁、煤、焦、矿等单位职工一条心、一股劲，分工把关，围攻硫害，共同争取钢铁优质高产。根据州委的要求，各煤、焦厂矿主要把守洗、选、炼三关。矿山把守好矿石锻、选两关；铁厂把守好原料、燃料入炉关和炉内外脱硫关。各厂矿都制定了脱硫指标。这样就使生铁生产的整个过程，形成了一环扣一环、关关攻硫害的“一条龙”。
    各厂矿都按照自己的任务组织职工群众献策献计，总结经验，大力推广各种行之有效的脱硫办法。渔洞煤矿党委书记任先锋深入生产第一线，集中群众智慧，总结出分层、分采、分运、分洗、分装、分炼和井内选、运输选、破碎选等“六分三选”的办法，使精煤结焦率提高了20％，焦的含硫量比原来降低40％。莲花山铁矿建立了一套选矿、锻矿制度，加强了锻、选工作，使矿石含硫下降到0.7％ 以下。炉山铁厂为了进一步加强厂内的脱硫工作，组织了冶炼和动力车间的 攻硫研究小组。动力车间负责供应大风量、高风温，以实现强化冶炼，提高脱硫效果；冶炼车间负责炉前炉后脱硫。他们推广了一系列先进经验，使生铁脱硫效果普遍达到40％至50％。
    各厂矿职工围绕提高生铁质量，继续开展了技术革新和技术革命运动。凯里煤矿职工利用山水试验成功了从洗煤、运煤到装窑炼焦的水力化生产，原煤灰份大大减少，焦炭含硫量由过去3％下降到1.3％至1.5％，精煤结焦率由50％提高到60％至75％。莲花山铁矿职工积极推广梭梭窑“一条龙”锻矿的先进经验，使矿石品位由40％左右提高到60％左右，熟料产量也大大增加，保证了座座高炉吃好矿。
