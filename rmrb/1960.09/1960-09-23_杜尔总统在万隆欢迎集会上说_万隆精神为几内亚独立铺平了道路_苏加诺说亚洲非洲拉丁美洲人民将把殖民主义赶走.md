Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, September 22nd: Guinean President Duer, who is currently visiting Indonesia, said to the crowds welcoming him in front of the West Java Provincial Assembly in Bandung on the afternoon of the 21st, "Imperialism does not allow us to live freely, but the Bandung Spirit paved the way for us to gain independence."

Duer said that the people of Guinea and Indonesia have both suffered the pain of colonialism, and that colonialism and enslavement have seriously hindered Guinea's progress. He added, however, that "the Bandung Spirit inspired the Guinean people who longed for independence, and paved the way for the Guinean people to gain independence and freedom. The Bandung Conference announced the principles of confirming human rights, non-interference in internal affairs, and respect for all countries."

Duer said that the Bandung Spirit, like a seed, has been planted and has now grown into a lush tree of independence all over the world. He pointed out that fighting for independence is not an easy task, and maintaining independence is even more difficult. He hoped that the Indonesian people would strengthen their national unity.

President Sukarno also spoke, saying that the people of Bandung warmly welcomed President Duer because Duer loves independence. He also said that President Duer "has fought against colonialism with us."

Sukarno called on the Indonesian people to continue the struggle against colonialism. He said: "We are not isolated. Standing with us in our struggle are two billion people from Asia, Africa, and Latin America. These people love independence and peace. They will drive away colonialism."
