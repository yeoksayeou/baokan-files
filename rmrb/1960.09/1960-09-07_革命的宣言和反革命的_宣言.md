    Revolutionary Declaration and Counter-Revolutionary "Declaration"

    On August 28th, the US imperialism forced the Organization of American States Foreign Ministers Meeting to adopt a so-called "Declaration of San José." On September 2nd, the Cuban People's National Assembly adopted a "Declaration of Havana" in response to the "Declaration of San José." The "Declaration of San José" is a counter-revolutionary "declaration" by US imperialism to suppress the Cuban and Latin American national democratic revolution, an aggressive "declaration" to interfere in the internal affairs of Cuba and Latin American countries; while the "Declaration of Havana" is a revolutionary declaration by the Cuban people to defend the revolution and by the Latin American people to break free from the shackles of US imperialism, an anti-interference declaration by the Cuban and Latin American people to resolutely oppose US imperialism's violation of their independence and sovereignty. These two declarations reflect a sharp struggle between justice and injustice between the Cuban and Latin American people and US imperialism, marking a new and important stage in this struggle.

    The "Declaration of San José" reiterates the "Declaration of Santiago" passed by the US manipulating the Meeting of Foreign Ministers of American States last August, and reiterates the so-called "non-interference" "principles," "respect for human rights," and opposition to "totalitarianism," all of which are excuses the US has consistently used to interfere in the Cuban revolution and the internal affairs of Latin American countries. The "Declaration of Havana" "strongly condemns the blatant and criminal interference of US imperialism in the peoples of Latin American countries for more than a century," declares that the peoples of Latin American countries have the sacred right to strive for national liberation, democratic freedom, and basic human rights, and reaffirms the Cuban people's "oath to defend the motherland to the death."

    The "Declaration of San José," using Washington's clumsy trick of the thief crying "stop thief," clamors to "resolutely condemn the ... interference of an extra-continental power in the affairs of American republics," groundlessly attacks the "attempts" of the Soviet Union and China to "destroy the unity of the hemisphere and endanger the peace and security of this hemisphere," in order to create pretexts for further interfering in Cuba and controlling other Latin American countries under the guise of "opposing the communist threat." The "Declaration of Havana" "resolutely denies that the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China have ever had the slightest 'attempt' to use Cuba's economic, political, and social position to undermine continental unity and threaten the unity of this hemisphere"; "believes that the US government's policy of isolating and antagonizing the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China, which it propagates and imposes on the governments of Latin American countries, and the US government's bellicose, aggressive actions and consistent refusal to admit the People's Republic of China into the United Nations, do indeed threaten the peace and security of this hemisphere and the world"; and reaffirms Cuba's acceptance of Soviet aid and announces the establishment of diplomatic relations with the People's Republic of China.

    The "Declaration of San José," in accordance with the so-called "Monroe Doctrine" publicly proclaimed by Eisenhower, promotes the "principles" of the so-called "Pan-American system"—that is, the robber principle of "America is for Americans," and demands that all member states of the Organization of American States "abide by" the "discipline of the Pan-American system," attempting to force the Cuban and Latin American people to submit to the big stick of US imperialism. The "Declaration of Havana" "condemns the attempt [of the US] to maintain the Monroe Doctrine"; announces the use of "Liberating Latin Americanism" to "confront hypocritical Pan-Americanism"; and reaffirms the belief that "Latin America will soon unite, break free from their shackles, and advance victoriously." Amidst the cheers of a million people attending the assembly, Cuban Prime Minister Castro tore up the notorious "Declaration of San José" and announced the abolition of the military treaty signed between Cuba and the United States in 1952.

      The sharp contrast between the "Declaration of San José" and the "Declaration of Havana" fully reveals the extremely ferocious ambition of US imperialism for interference and aggression, and the revolutionary will and heroic spirit of the Cuban and the entire Latin American people. This contrast clearly divides the two major camps of counter-revolution and revolution, interference and anti-interference, aggression and anti-aggression in Latin America, like night and day, revealing the great struggle of Latin America from humiliation to new life, from enslavement to liberation, and from oppression to freedom.

    The "Declaration of San José," concocted single-handedly by US imperialism, is directed not only at the Cuban revolution but also at the entire Latin American national democratic revolution; its purpose is not only to organize further interference in Cuba but also to resist the influence of the Cuban revolution, strengthen control over the entire Latin American countries, and prop up the tottering "family empire" of US monopoly capital in Latin America. US Secretary of State Herter bluntly stated that the "Declaration of San José" "is a clear indictment of the Castro government in Cuba," while also "emphasizing the obligations undertaken by member states in complying with the discipline of the Pan-American system." This is exactly as the "Declaration of Havana" pointedly stated: the "Declaration of San José" is "a document imposed by US imperialism, violating the national self-determination, sovereignty, and dignity of the fraternal peoples of the continent." The reason why the Cuban revolution makes US imperialism feel like thorns in its back, and it is determined to get rid of it, is precisely because the Cuban people made a revolution, overthrew the rule of US imperialism and its running dog Batista clique, established a national democratic revolutionary regime, gradually nationalized the property plundered by US monopoly capital in Cuba, and implemented a policy of friendship with socialist countries and the people of the world, and resolutely fought back against the interference activities of US imperialism, regardless of the "Declaration of Santiago" and the "discipline of the Pan-American system." The Cuban people's revolution and anti-interference struggle immediately won the sympathy and support of the people of all Latin American countries, greatly encouraging the Latin American national democratic revolution, and at the same time, the contradictions between Latin American countries and US imperialism deepened, further shaking the foundations of the US "Monroe Doctrine." This is why Eisenhower hastily reiterated the "Monroe Doctrine" and clamored to "expand" the "Monroe Doctrine." This is why US imperialism wields the big stick of "the discipline of the Pan-American system" in the Organization of American States while carrying out a series of barbaric interferences and threats against Cuba.

    According to the robber logic of US imperialism and the "Declaration of San José," Latin America should forever become the private property of US imperialism, submitting to its orders and allowing it to plunder, which is called "the unity and security of the Americas." The "Pan-American system" and its "discipline" are nothing but a set of shackles that "unite" Latin America under the control of US imperialism and ensure the "security" of US monopoly capital's plunder of Latin America. However, no matter how strong the military pressure of US imperialism, various unequal treaties, and the traitorous dictatorial rule loyal to it, it can never suppress the increasingly strong resistance of the vast numbers of workers, peasants, progressive national bourgeoisie, and progressive intellectuals in Latin America for a long time. Cuba finally broke out in revolution, and the entire Latin America is also spewing revolutionary sparks. The Cuban people and the Latin American people are united with the people of the world, especially with the full support of the socialist camp. Thus, US imperialism became furious and resorted to interference and threats. The Cuban people chose their own system and rejected the "representative system" designated by US imperialism; the Cuban people abolished the large estate system, recovered American enterprises, and started their new economic life; and US imperialism slandered it as "totalitarianism," "not representing the will of the Cuban people," and not "respecting individual rights." The Cuban people and the people of Latin American countries support each other in the struggle for national democratic revolution, but US imperialism slanders it as "interfering" in the internal affairs of other countries. US imperialism is trying to murder the Cuban people, but it slanders the Cuban people, who have won the sympathy and support of socialist countries, as "accepting the threat of extra-continental interference." US imperialism carried out a series of blatant interferences in Cuba, but slandered Cuba as "violating the legitimate rights and interests of the United States" and "vilifying" the United States, and even openly attacked Cuba for not accepting the "Declaration of Santiago," which interferes in Cuba. US imperialism attempts to impose its robber logic and robber "principles" on the Cuban and Latin American people by force and pressure. This is the entire essence of the "Declaration of San José."

    However, the era of US imperialism's rampage is over, and the era in which only US imperialism is allowed to have this and that "declaration" and the Latin American people are not allowed to have their own declaration is over. Now that there is a "Declaration of San José," there is also a "Declaration of Havana." The "Declaration of Havana" relentlessly lashes out at the robber "principles" of the "Declaration of San José" and puts forward the Latin American people's own just principles, which are: the principle that Latin America is not American Latin America, but the Latin America of the Latin American people; the principle that the Latin American people have the right to strive for and maintain independent sovereignty, establish their own regimes, and determine their own foreign policies; the principle that the Latin American people must abolish foreign capital monopoly and exploitation, overcome backwardness and poverty, and develop an independent economy; and the principle that the Latin American people are not subject to the control and restraint of US imperialism and the "Pan-American system," and resist US imperialism's interference and aggression. These are precisely the principles that the heroic Cuban people have been implementing in the struggle against US imperialism for more than a year and that the Latin American people yearn for. The Cuban people's adherence to and insistence on such principles has enabled Cuba to continuously strengthen its position, strengthen its strength, and show a vibrant and prosperous new scene. This is completely different from the current situation of some Latin American countries that are dependent on the policies of US imperialism. The Cuban people have made significant contributions to the struggle for the victory of the national democratic revolution of the Latin American people and to opening up a new era for the Latin American people to be the masters of their own affairs, thus winning the praise and support of the Latin American people and the people of the world.

    The "Declaration of San José" only represents a small handful of US imperialists and their followers, while the "Declaration of Havana" represents the Cuban people and the vast people of Latin America. The facts before our eyes have already provided strong proof. As Cuban Prime Minister Castro pointed out, "It is one thing for the United States to manipulate the meeting, but it is quite another thing to manipulate the people." "The US imperialists cannot take away the fraternal friendship of the peoples of Latin American countries towards the Cuban people, who are fighting against imperialism, the common enemy of the Latin American people." People in Venezuela, Costa Rica, Uruguay and other countries have held demonstrations and rallies, and the cry of "We want Cuba, not the Yankees" has resounded through the sky. Public opinion in Latin American countries has also widely condemned the "Declaration of San José" and supported the "Declaration of Havana." The Chilean newspaper "Ultima Hora" editorial said: "It can be considered that the 'Declaration of Havana' is a solemn response from Latin America to the shameful 'Declaration of San José.' ... It should receive the active support of all people's organizations on the continent and every progressive person." The "Declaration of San José" cannot hide the setbacks of US imperialism. Although it used the means of flaunting checks and strong pressure, it still failed to achieve the goal of forcing the Meeting of Foreign Ministers of the Organization of American States to openly condemn and interfere in Cuba. Even the US "New York Times" admitted that "Latin American representatives expressed a certain degree of sympathy and understanding for the Cuban social revolution... Anti-Americanism—this is a Latin American, not just a Cuban phenomenon."

      The "Declaration of Havana" is a proclamation by the Cuban and Latin American people to continue their denunciation of US imperialism. It reveals the hatred, contempt, and disdain of the Cuban and Latin American people towards US imperialism. This is an event of great significance. It pronounces the death sentence of the "Monroe Doctrine" that has been rampant in Latin America for 177 years, tears up the anti-revolutionary "declaration" of US imperialism using the "Organization of American States" to interfere in the internal affairs of Latin America for 70 years, despises the "principles" and "discipline" of the sacred and inviolable "Pan-Americanism," and is determined to bring down the US imperialist overlord riding on the heads of the Latin American people. The "Declaration of San José" has shown that US imperialism will never learn a lesson from its failures, and it will carry out even more vicious criminal activities to interfere in Cuba and suppress the Latin American national democratic revolutionary movement, and even openly carry out armed interference. However, any aggressive conspiracy of US imperialism can only be thoroughly bankrupted like the "Declaration of San José" being torn to pieces; and the national democratic revolutionary cause of the Cuban and Latin American people will be greatly developed with the birth of the "Declaration of Havana."

### 革命的宣言和反革命的“宣言”

    革命的宣言和反革命的“宣言”
    上月28日，美帝国主义强迫美洲国家组织外长会议通过了一个所谓“圣约瑟宣言”。9月2日，古巴人民全国大会通过了一个反击“圣约瑟宣言”的“哈瓦那宣言”。“圣约瑟宣言”是美帝国主义镇压古巴和拉丁美洲民族民主革命运动的反革命的“宣言”，干涉古巴和拉丁美洲国家内部事务的侵略性“宣言”；而“哈瓦那宣言”则是古巴人民捍卫革命、拉丁美洲人民争取摆脱美帝国主义束缚的革命宣言，是古巴和拉丁美洲人民坚决反对美帝国主义侵犯他们的独立主权的反干涉宣言。这两个宣言，反映了古巴人民和拉丁美洲人民同美帝国主义之间正在进行的一场正义与非正义的针锋相对的斗争，标志着这场斗争进入了一个新的重要阶段。
    “圣约瑟宣言”重申美国在去年8月操纵美洲国家外长会议通过的“圣地亚哥宣言”，并重申所谓“不干涉”“原则”、“尊重人权”和反对“极权主义”，而这些都是美国一贯用以干涉古巴革命和拉丁美洲各国内政的口实。“哈瓦那宣言”“强烈谴责美帝国主义一个多世纪来对拉丁美洲各国人民的明目张胆的罪恶干涉”，宣布拉丁美洲各国人民拥有争取民族解放、民主自由和基本人权的神圣权利，重申古巴人民“誓死保卫祖国”。
    “圣约瑟宣言”以华盛顿贼喊捉贼的拙劣手法，叫嚷什么“坚决谴责一个外洲国家对美洲共和国事务的……干涉”，无中生有地攻击苏联和中国“摧毁半球的团结和危害本半球和平和安全”的“企图”，以便在“反对共产主义威胁”的幌子下，为进一步干涉古巴和控制拉丁美洲其他国家制造借口。“哈瓦那宣言”“坚决否认，苏联和中华人民共和国曾有过丝毫想利用古巴的经济、政治和社会地位来破坏大陆团结和威胁本半球团结”的“企图”；“认为，美国政府宣扬和强加给拉丁美洲各国政府的孤立和敌视苏联和中华人民共和国的政策，美国政府的好战的、侵略的行为和一贯拒绝中华人民共和国进入联合国，的确威胁着本半球和世界的和平与安全”；重申古巴接受苏联的援助，并宣布同中华人民共和国建立外交关系。
    “圣约瑟宣言”按照艾森豪威尔所公开宣称的所谓“门罗主义”，宣扬所谓“泛美体系”的“原则”——即“美洲是美国人的美洲”的强盗原则，并要所有美洲国家组织成员国“遵守”“泛美体系的纪律”，妄图迫使古巴和拉丁美洲人民屈服于美帝国主义的大棒之下。“哈瓦那宣言”“谴责（美国）保持门罗主义的企图”；宣布以“解放的拉丁美洲主义”，“对抗虚伪的泛美主义”；重申“拉丁美洲很快就将团结在一起，摆脱对他们的束缚，胜利前进”的信念。古巴总理卡斯特罗在参加大会的一百万人民的欢呼下，撕毁了臭名远扬的“圣约瑟宣言”，并宣布废除1952年古巴与美国签订的军事条约。
      “圣约瑟宣言”和“哈瓦那宣言”的鲜明对照，把美帝国主义极端凶恶的干涉和侵略野心，和古巴以及整个拉丁美洲人民的正气磅礴的革命意志和英雄气概，和盘托出来了。这一对照，像黑夜和白昼那样清晰地划分了拉丁美洲反革命和革命、干涉和反干涉、侵略和反侵略的两大营垒，揭开了拉丁美洲从屈辱走向新生、从被奴役走向解放、从被压迫走向自由的巨大斗争。
    美帝国主义一手制订的“圣约瑟宣言”，其矛头不仅指向古巴革命，而且指向整个拉丁美洲民族民主革命运动；其目的不仅在于组织对古巴的进一步干涉，而且在于抵制古巴革命的影响，加强对整个拉丁美洲国家的控制，支撑美国垄断资本在拉丁美洲摇摇欲坠的“家天下”。美国国务卿赫脱毫不讳言地说，“圣约瑟宣言”“对古巴卡斯特罗政府的控诉是明显的”，同时“强调指出了成员国在服从泛美体系的纪律方面所承担的义务”。这正如“哈瓦那宣言”一针见血地所指出的：“圣约瑟宣言”是“美帝国主义强加的、侵犯大陆兄弟人民的民族自决权、主权和尊严的文件”。古巴革命之所以使美帝国主义如芒刺在背，必欲去之而后快，正是因为古巴人民闹了革命，推翻了美帝国主义及其走狗巴蒂斯塔集团的统治，建立了民族民主革命的政权，把美国垄断资本在古巴掠夺的财产逐步收归人民所有，并执行同社会主义国家和全世界人民友好的政策，而且不顾“圣地亚哥宣言”和“泛美体系的纪律”，坚决反击美帝国主义的干涉活动。古巴人民的革命和反干涉斗争，立即得到了拉丁美洲各国人民的同情和支持，大大鼓舞了拉丁美洲民族民主革命运动，同时拉丁美洲国家同美帝国主义间的矛盾也加深了，使美国“门罗主义”的根基发生了进一步的动摇。这就是为什么艾森豪威尔慌忙重申“门罗主义”，叫嚷要“扩大”“门罗主义”的缘故。这就是为什么美帝国主义在对古巴进行一系列的野蛮干涉和威胁的同时，在美洲国家组织抡起“泛美体系的纪律”的大棒的缘故。
    根据美帝国主义和“圣约瑟宣言”的强盗逻辑，拉丁美洲应该永远成为美帝国主义的禁脔，屈从它的号令，听任它的掠夺，这就叫做“美洲的团结和安全”。“泛美体系”和它的“纪律”不是别的，正是把拉丁美洲“团结”在美帝国主义的控制下，保证美国垄断资本掠夺拉丁美洲的“安全”的一套枷锁。但是，不管美帝国主义有着多么强大的军事压力、各种的不平等条约和忠于它的卖国独裁统治，也决不能长期镇压拉丁美洲广大工人、农民、进步的民族资产阶级和进步的知识分子日益强烈的反抗。古巴终于爆发了革命，整个拉丁美洲也喷射着革命的火花，古巴人民和拉丁美洲以及全世界人民联合起来，特别是取得了社会主义阵营的全力支持。于是，美帝国主义就暴跳如雷，横施干涉和威胁。古巴人民自己选择了自己的制度，而拒绝美帝国主义所指定的“代议制制度”；古巴人民废除大庄园制，收回美国企业，开创着自己的新的经济生活；而美帝国主义就诬蔑为“极权主义”、“不代表古巴人民意愿”、不“尊重个人权利”。古巴人民同拉丁美洲各国人民在民族民主革命斗争中互相支持，美帝国主义却诬蔑为“干涉”别国内政。美帝国主义力图向古巴人民下毒手，却又诬蔑取得了社会主义国家的同情和支持的古巴人民“接受外洲干涉的威胁”。美帝国主义对古巴进行了一系列明目张胆的干涉，却诬蔑古巴“侵犯了美国的合法权益”、“诋毁”美国，而且竟公然攻击古巴不接受干涉古巴的“圣地亚哥宣言”。美帝国主义妄图以武力和压力，把它的这个强盗逻辑和强盗“原则”强加于古巴和拉丁美洲人民身上。这就是“圣约瑟宣言”的全部实质。
    但是，美帝国主义横行霸道的时代过去了，只许美帝国主义有这样那样的“宣言”，而不许拉丁美洲人民有自己的宣言的时代过去了。现在有了“圣约瑟宣言”，也就有了“哈瓦那宣言”。“哈瓦那宣言”无情地鞭笞了“圣约瑟宣言”的强盗“原则”，提出了拉丁美洲人民自己的正义原则，这就是：拉丁美洲不是美国人的拉丁美洲，而是拉丁美洲人民的拉丁美洲的原则；拉丁美洲人民有权争取和维护独立主权、建立自己的政权、决定自己的外交政策的原则；拉丁美洲人民必须取消外国资本垄断和剥削、克服落后与贫穷状态，发展独立经济的原则；拉丁美洲人民不受美帝国主义和“泛美体系”的控制和束缚，反击美帝国主义干涉和侵略的原则。这正是英雄的古巴人民一年多来在反对美帝国主义的斗争中所履行并为拉丁美洲人民所向往的原则。古巴人民遵循和坚持这样的原则，使得古巴不断加强了自己的阵地，壮大了自己的力量，出现了生气勃勃、欣欣向荣的新景象。这同其他一些依附于美帝国主义政策的拉丁美洲国家的现状，截然不同。古巴人民为拉丁美洲人民争取民族民主革命胜利，为开辟拉丁美洲人民当家作主的新时期的斗争作出了重大的贡献，因而赢得了拉丁美洲人民和全世界人民的赞扬和支持。
    “圣约瑟宣言”只是代表一小撮美帝国主义者及其追随者，“哈瓦那宣言”则代表古巴人民和拉丁美洲的广大人民。眼前的事实，就已作了有力的证明。正如古巴总理卡斯特罗所指出的，“美国操纵会议是一回事，操纵人民却完全是另一回事。”“美帝国主义者是不能够夺去拉丁美洲各国人民对古巴人民的兄弟情谊的，古巴人民正在为反对拉丁美洲人民的共同敌人帝国主义而斗争”。委内瑞拉、哥斯达黎加、乌拉圭等国人民纷纷举行示威和集会，“要古巴，不要美国佬”的呼声，响彻云霄。拉丁美洲各国公众舆论也广泛谴责“圣约瑟宣言”，支持“哈瓦那宣言”。智利“最后一点钟报”社论就说：“可以认为‘哈瓦那宣言’是拉丁美洲对可耻的‘圣约瑟宣言’的严正的回答。……应该得到大陆所有人民团体和每一位进步人士的积极支持。”“圣约瑟宣言”并不能掩盖美帝国主义的挫折。它虽然施展了炫耀支票和强大压力的手段，但仍然未能实现迫使美洲国家组织外长会议公开谴责和干涉古巴的目的。连美国“纽约时报”也承认，“拉丁美洲的代表对古巴社会革命表示了某种程度的同情和谅解……。反美主义——这是拉丁美洲的，而不仅是古巴的现象”。
      “哈瓦那宣言”是古巴和拉丁美洲人民再接再厉地声讨美帝国主义的檄文，它表露出古巴和拉丁美洲人民对美帝国主义的仇视、鄙视和蔑视。这是具有重大意义的事件。它宣判了美帝国主义一百七十七年来横行拉丁美洲的“门罗主义”的死刑，撕毁了美帝国主义七十年来利用“美洲国家组织”干涉拉丁美洲内政的反革命“宣言”，蔑视了神圣不可侵犯的“泛美主义”的“原则”和“纪律”，要把骑在拉丁美洲人民头上的美帝国主义太上皇拉下马来。“圣约瑟宣言”已经表明，美帝国主义决不会从失败中接受教训，它将要更凶恶地进行干涉古巴和镇压拉丁美洲民族民主革命运动的罪恶活动，甚至公然进行武装干涉。但是，美帝国主义的任何侵略阴谋，都只能像“圣约瑟宣言”之被撕成粉碎一样遭到彻底破产；而古巴和拉丁美洲人民的民族民主革命事业则将以“哈瓦那宣言”的诞生而获得更大的发展。
