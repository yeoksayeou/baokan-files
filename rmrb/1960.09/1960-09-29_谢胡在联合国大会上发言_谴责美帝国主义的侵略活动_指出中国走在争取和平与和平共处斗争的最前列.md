Xinhua News Agency, New York, 28th: At the United Nations General Assembly held on the afternoon of the 26th, the Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the People's Republic of Albania, Shehu, delivered a speech.

　　Shehu pointed out that this year's session of the United Nations General Assembly is being held in an atmosphere of intensified international tension, which is caused by the imperialist bloc's implementation of the "Cold War" policy and the "position of strength" policy.

　　Shehu pointed out that the current session of the United Nations General Assembly will discuss the issue of US aggression against the Soviet Union, and he resolutely condemned the US aggression against the Soviet Union. He said that in fact, the US policy of aggression is not only directed against the Soviet Union, People's China, and other people's democracies, but also against all countries that are unwilling to submit to US imperialism and wish to live freely. Shehu recounted the intrusion of the American "U-2" spy plane into the Soviet Union, the aggression of the Congo by the United States-led imperialist countries, the imperialist interference in the internal affairs of Laos, and the countless crimes committed in South Vietnam.

　　Speaking on the issue of eliminating the colonial system, Shehu said that the shameful colonial system has reached its end. The Government of the People's Republic of Albania fully agrees with the Soviet proposal that the issue of the complete and thorough elimination of all forms of colonialism should be raised now. Shehu condemned the imperialist countries for using the United Nations to serve colonial interests, and condemned the colonialists for trying to suppress the independence of the Republic of the Congo. He agreed with Khrushchev's condemnation of the activities of UN Secretary-General Hammarskjold, and supported the Soviet proposal to replace the post of UN Secretary-General with a collective body and to reconsider the location of UN headquarters.

　　Shehu said that the Albanian government advocates complete and thorough disarmament and supports the Soviet proposal on this issue. He pointed out that the Soviet Union has demonstrated its sincerity in disarmament by unilaterally reducing its armed forces by one-third, while the North Atlantic Group has decided to increase the armed forces of its member states. The United States has increased its military budget, West German militarization has reached a threatening scale, and the United States has also carried out blatant provocations against socialist countries. Shehu said that the Western countries have once again demonstrated by their position that they oppose complete and thorough disarmament. Socialist countries had to withdraw from the Ten-Nation Disarmament Committee, thereby preventing Western countries from using the committee's endless negotiations as a cover to conceal their conspiracies aimed at opposing the cause of peace. The Western countries are responsible for the breakdown of negotiations in this committee.

　　Shehu went on to say that the issue of restoring the legitimate rights of the People's Republic of China in the United Nations has become an urgent matter in line with the interests of the United Nations organization itself and the interests of peace. The Albanian government fully supports the Soviet government's proposal to include the issue of the representation of the People's Republic of China in the United Nations on the agenda of the current session of the United Nations General Assembly. Shehu emphasized that the People's Republic of China has become the most important factor for peace and progress in Asia and the world. He condemned the United States' illegal occupation of China's territory of Taiwan and the coastal islands belonging to the People's Republic of China, and he sternly refuted the imperialists' fallacy of accusing China of being "belligerent." He said that the People's Republic of China is at the forefront of the struggle for peace and peaceful coexistence.

　　Shehu went on to say that his government believes that it is just to allow the Mongolian People's Republic, which has long applied to join the United Nations and is known as a peace-loving and democratic country, to obtain its due place in the United Nations.

　　The head of the Albanian delegation pointed out that Albania's foreign policy is based on friendship and solidarity with the countries of the socialist camp and on the basis of peaceful coexistence between countries with different social systems.

　　Shehu cited a series of convincing examples to illustrate the achievements made by the Albanian people in the economic and cultural fields. He emphasized that socialism has made Albania an advanced, strong, and inviolable country.

　　Shehu also said that the People's Republic of Albania, together with the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of Bulgaria, and the People's Republic of Romania, has made many efforts to make the Balkans and the Adriatic region a region of peace in Europe. He added that the initiative aimed at turning the Balkans and the Adriatic region into a zone free of nuclear and rocket weapons is fully in line with the above-mentioned goal.

　　The head of the Albanian delegation emphasized that the establishment of nuclear and rocket weapons bases in Albania's immediate neighbors, Italy and Greece, directly threatens Albania and other people's democracies in the Balkans. The Albanian government expresses its willingness to negotiate with the Greek government on the establishment of normal relations between the two countries on the basis of complete equality and without any political conditions or territorial claims. The Chairman of the Council of Ministers of Albania finally expressed his firm protest against the attempt by the delegations of many Western countries to include provocative issues such as the so-called "Hungarian question" on the agenda of the meeting and to force the assembly to discuss them. He pointed out that these provocative issues are a crude and intolerable interference in the internal affairs of sovereign states.

　　谢胡在联合国大会上发言
　　谴责美帝国主义的侵略活动
　　指出中国走在争取和平与和平共处斗争的最前列
    新华社28日讯　纽约消息：在  26日下午举行的联合国大会上，阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国部长会议主席谢胡发了言。
      谢胡指出，在今年，联合国大会会议是在国际局势尖锐化的气氛中进行的，这种局势是由于帝国主义集团执行“冷战”政策和“实力地位”政策所造成的。
    谢胡指出，联合国大会本届会议将要讨论关于美国对苏联的侵略行动问题，他坚决谴责美国对苏联所进行的侵略行动。他说，实际上，美国的侵略政策不仅针对苏联、人民中国和其他人民民主国家，而且也针对一切不愿屈从美帝国主义和希望自由地生活的国家。谢胡追述了美国“U—2”间谍飞机侵入苏联、以美国为首的帝国主义国家侵略刚果、帝国主义干涉老挝内政以及在越南南方犯下的无数罪行。
    谢胡在谈到消灭殖民制度问题时说，可耻的殖民制度已经到了末日。阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国政府完全同意苏联的建议，现在就应该提出完全彻底消灭各种形式的殖民主义制度的问题。谢胡谴责帝国主义国家利用联合国来为殖民利益服务，谴责殖民主义者竭力镇压刚果共和国的独立。他同意赫鲁晓夫对联合国秘书长哈马舍尔德活动的谴责，并支持苏联关于用集体机构来代替联合国秘书长职务以及关于重新考虑联合国总部所在地问题的建议。
    谢胡说，阿尔巴尼亚政府主张全面彻底裁军，支持苏联对这个问题的建议。他指出，苏联表现了裁军的诚意，它单方面裁减了自己的武装部队三分之一，而北大西洋集团却决定增加其成员国的武装部队。美国增加了它的军事预算，西德军国主义化已经具有威胁性的规模，美国还对社会主义国家进行了粗暴的挑衅行动。谢胡说，西方国家以自己的立场再次表明，它们反对全面彻底裁军。社会主义国家不得不退出十国裁军委员会，从而不让西方国家有可能利用委员会的无休止的谈判作为幌子，来掩饰它们旨在反对和平事业的阴谋。西方国家应对这个委员会谈判的破裂负责。
    谢胡接着说，关于恢复中华人民共和国在联合国的合法权利的问题已成为刻不容缓的、符合联合国组织本身和和平利益的事情。阿尔巴尼亚政府完全支持苏联政府关于把中华人民共和国在联合国的代表权问题列入联合国大会本届会议议程的建议。谢胡着重指出，中华人民共和国已成为亚洲和全世界和平与进步的最重要的因素。他谴责美国非法侵占中国领土台湾和属于中华人民共和国的沿海岛屿的强盗行为，他并且严正驳斥了帝国主义者诬蔑中国“好战”的谬论。他说，中华人民共和国走在争取和平与和平共处斗争的最前列。
    谢胡接着说，他的政府认为让早已申请加入联合国并作为一个热爱和平和民主的国家而著称的蒙古人民共和国在联合国中取得应有的地位，是公正的。
    阿尔巴尼亚代表团团长指出，阿尔巴尼亚的外交政策是建立在同社会主义阵营各国友好和团结的基础之上的，是建立在社会制度不同的国家之间实行和平共处的基础之上的。
    谢胡列举了一系列的令人信服的例子，说明阿尔巴尼亚人民在经济和文化方面所取得的成就。他着重指出，社会主义已使阿尔巴尼亚成为先进的、强大的和不可侵犯的国家。
    谢胡还说：阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国同苏联、保加利亚人民共和国和罗马尼亚人民共和国一道作了许多努力，以便使巴尔干和亚得里亚地区成为欧洲的和平地区。他补充说，旨在把巴尔干和亚得里亚地区变成无原子武器和火箭武器区的倡议，是完全符合于上述目的的。
    阿尔巴尼亚代表团团长着重指出，在阿尔巴尼亚的紧邻意大利和希腊建立原子和火箭武器基地，直接威胁着阿尔巴尼亚和巴尔干其他人民民主国家。阿尔巴尼亚政府表示愿意在完全平等、彼此不提出任何政治条件或领土要求的情况下同希腊政府就确立两国的正常关系进行谈判。阿尔巴尼亚部长会议主席最后表示坚决抗议许多西方国家的代表团企图把像所谓“匈牙利问题”这样的挑衅性问题列入会议议程，并强迫大会进行讨论。他指出，这些挑衅性问题是对主权国家的内政的粗暴的和不能容忍的干涉。
