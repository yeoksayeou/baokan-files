    (Reported by our newspaper) ?Jiang County, Yunnan Province, resolutely implements the policy of combining high yields with multiple harvests, resulting in substantial increases in grain production year after year. Over the past five years, the unit area yield of basic farmland in ?Jiang County has nearly doubled, and the cultivated land area has expanded by more than 80%, leading to a significant increase in the county's total grain output.
    ?Jiang County has excellent natural conditions for agricultural production. The mountainous area has vast arable land, with several flat dams nestled among the mountains. The soil in the dam areas is fertile, and the climate is warm, making it suitable for rice cultivation. However, due to poor water conservancy conditions and relatively extensive farming techniques in the past, the average unit area yield of rice in the dam areas was only over 600 jin by 1956. The county Party committee analyzed this situation and believed that, under the then-existing conditions, the dam areas had the greatest potential for increasing rice production, and concentrating major efforts on improving the unit area yield of the dam areas was a way to increase grain production in a more, faster, better, and more economical manner. In the past, there were no reservoirs in the ?Jiang dam area, and over 30,000 mu of paddy fields lacked fixed sources of irrigation. From 1957 to 1959, the county built four reservoirs, which not only solved the irrigation problem for the entire dam area's paddy fields but also expanded the paddy field area by more than 10,000 mu. At the same time, the county Party committee carried out arduous work in deep plowing, seed selection, and cultivating strong seedlings. The first secretary of the county Party committee personally led commune members in deep plowing, eliminating shallow-plowed "Pu La Tian" (a local term for poorly plowed fields). Previously, the ?Jiang County dam area planted Da Bai Gu (Big White Rice) and Da Hong Gu (Big Red Rice), which were susceptible to disease and prone to lodging, resulting in unstable yields. The county Party committee systematically tested more than 40 varieties of high-quality rice seeds and finally selected Xiao Bai Gu (Small White Rice) and Xiao Hong Gu (Small Red Rice), which were resistant to disease and high-yielding. ?Jiang County has always had experienced old farmers specially cultivate seedlings every year, resulting in strong seedlings. After systematically focusing on the above-mentioned yield-increasing measures, the average unit area yield of rice in the county's dam areas rose to over 800 jin in just two to three years, and some rice yields reached around 1,000 jin. The technology for achieving a yield of 1,000 jin per mu is being mastered by more and more commune members.
    While increasing the unit area yield of rice, the ?Jiang County Party Committee conducted two types of experiments for four consecutive years, starting in 1956. The first experiment was to break through the 1,000-jin mark for rice. The county Party committee selected 43 different high-yielding rice varieties for high-yield experiments. The second experiment was to expand the cultivated land area. The first secretary of the county Party committee personally led commune members from the Jihua Management Area, where the average rice yield was 1,000 jin per mu, to reclaim wasteland in the mountains. Over the past five years, more than 1,000 mu of land have been reclaimed, and some basic construction has been carried out on the reclaimed land, resulting in annual increases in grain production.
    The ?Jiang County Party Committee comprehensively analyzed the experience of the Jihua Management Area in developing mountain areas and achieving high rice yields, and believed that the high yields and multiple harvests of basic farmland in the dam areas are the key to annual grain production. On the premise of concentrating major efforts to first ensure high yields and multiple harvests, planned and step-by-step expansion of the cultivated land area and active development towards multiple planting and multiple harvests can ensure the production of more grain.
    Based on this situation, the ?Jiang County Party Committee decided to further comprehensively implement the policy of combining high yields with multiple harvests. In terms of high yields, the county Party committee required all management areas to continue to promote advanced experiences, so that areas with rice yields below 1,000 jin per mu would quickly catch up with the average advanced level. Areas that had already reached an average yield of 1,000 jin per mu would continue to conduct high-yield experiments and gradually summarize a set of universal laws for breaking through the 1,000-jin mark. At the same time, the county launched a mass movement to develop mountain areas in a planned manner. The slogan for the entire county's actions was: "Bring out as many people as possible, advance as far as possible into the mountains, and increase grain production by one mu for every mu of wasteland reclaimed."
    The county first implemented a method of contracting out the work by area, dividing 200,000 mu of wasteland among the management areas for contracted reclamation, ushering in a new period of comprehensive, planned, and contracted development of the county's mountain areas. Secondly, it unified the organization and use of labor from both the mountain and dam areas. In January of this year, taking advantage of the interval when winter crops were mature but not yet harvested, all 30 management areas and more than 300 production teams in the county organized 12,000 laborers and 2,000 head of cattle to launch a 12-day shock campaign in the mountains, reclaiming more than 40,000 mu of wasteland. In order to squeeze out time to plant mountain newly reclaimed land well, each management area reformed the summer harvesting tools in sets, and the time for summer harvesting in the county was shortened by more than a month compared to last year. The production teams took this opportunity to launch a shock campaign in the mountains, leveling all the more than 40,000 mu of reclaimed wasteland and planting grain, which promoted production in the dam areas and doubled the area of grain crops in the mountain areas.
    The combination of dam areas and mountain areas, and the comprehensive implementation of high yields and multiple harvests, has led to a series of new changes. The county's total grain output has increased substantially every year. In the past, there were only more than 20,000 mu of land in the mountain areas. Since 1956, more than 40,000 mu of wasteland have been reclaimed. Therefore, last year's total grain output was more than double that of 1954.
    During these five years, the county has experienced more than a dozen droughts, floods, pests, diseases, winds, frosts, floods, hailstorms, and other disasters. Small areas of grain production have been reduced due to disasters, but due to the expansion of the cultivated land area, the county's total grain output has still increased by an average of 15% to 20% per year. In 1958, ?Jiang County experienced a severe drought not seen in decades, but grain production still increased. This year, the county has again gone more than 260 days without significant rainfall, and the drought is even more severe. Due to the high temperature, there has also been a major insect plague. However, due to the fact that all 300 production teams in the county have adopted the method of combining dam areas and mountain areas, concentrating their efforts to fight annihilation battles, and doing a timely job of preventing and combating disasters, this year's crops are still growing well.

    ?江县掌握自然特点实现高产多收和多种多收
    大力提高坝区稻田单位产量
    积极扩大山区粮食种植面积
    本报讯　云南省?江县坚决执行高产多收与多种多收相结合的方针，使全县粮食产量连年获得了大幅度的增长。五年来，?江县基本农田的单位面积产量提高了将近一倍，耕地面积也扩大了80％以上，全县的粮食总产量有了很大的增长。
    ?江县农业生产的自然条件很好，山区可耕面积广阔，群山之间有几个平坝子，坝区土壤肥沃，气候温暖，适宜种植水稻。但是，由于过去水利条件差，耕作技术比较粗放，到1956年，坝区水稻平均单位面积产量才六百多斤。县委分析了这种情况，认为在当时的条件下，坝区水稻的增产潜力最大，集中主要精力提高坝区单位面积产量，是多、快、好、省增产粮食的办法。过去，?江坝区没有水库，三万多亩水田都没有固定的水源灌溉。从1957年到1959年，全县修了四个水库，不仅解决了整个坝区水田的灌溉问题，还扩大了一万多亩水田。同时，县委又从深翻、选种与培育壮秧等方面进行了艰苦的工作。县委第一书记亲自率领社员深翻田地，消灭了浅翻的“铺拉田”。以往，?江县坝区种的是大白谷和大红谷，这两样谷种抗病力弱，又易倒伏，产量很不稳定。县委有计划地先后试种了四十多种水稻良种，最后选择了抗病力强而又高产的小白谷和小红谷。?江县每年都找有经验的老农专门培育秧苗，因而，使秧苗长得很壮。在有计划地抓好了以上几个增产措施以后，全县坝区水稻的平均单位面积产量在短短两、三年间就上升到了八百多斤，并且有一部分水稻单产达到了一千斤左右。丰产千斤的技术正在为越来越多的社员所掌握。
    在提高水稻单位面积产量的同时，中共?江县委从1956年开始连续四年分别作了两种试验。第一个试验是突破水稻千斤关。县委选用四十三种不同的高产水稻良种，进行高产试验。第二个试验是扩大耕地面积。县委第一书记亲自率领水稻平均亩产千斤的吉花管理区的社员上山开荒。五年来共开了一千多亩田地，并在已开的荒地上进行了一些基本建设，粮食年年增产。
    中共?江县委综合分析了吉花管理区开发山区和水稻高产的经验，认为坝区基本农田的高产多收，是全年粮食生产的关键；在集中主要力量首先保证搞好高产多收的前提下，有计划、有步骤地扩大耕地面积，积极向多种多收发展，才能保证增产更多的粮食。
    根据这一情况，中共?江县委决定进一步全面贯彻高产多收和多种多收相结合的方针。在高产多收方面，县委要求各管理区继续推广先进经验，使水稻亩产千斤以下的地方，迅速赶上平均先进水平。已经达到平均亩产千斤的地方，继续进行高产试验，逐步总结出一套突破千斤关的普遍规律。同时，全县又开展了有计划地开发山区的群众运动，全县行动的口号是：“能拿出多少人就拿出多少人，能向山区进一尺就进一尺，能多开一亩荒地，就多增产一亩地的粮食。”
    全县首先实行了分片包干的办法，把二十万亩荒地分给各个管理区包干开垦，使全县的山区进入了一个全面的、有计划的、分片包干进行开发的新时期。其次，统一组织使用山区和坝区的劳动力。全县三十个管理区和三百多个生产队，在今年1月份，趁越冬作物已经成熟、还不能收割的间隙，组织了一万二千个劳力、两千条牛，上山突击了十二天，开出了四万多亩荒地。为了挤出时间种好山区新垦田地，各管理区成套地改革了夏收工具，全县夏收的时间比去年缩短了一个多月。各生产队利用这个机会在山上突击，把已开的四万多亩荒地全部平整了出来，种上了粮食，既促进了坝区生产，又使山区粮食作物的面积扩大了一倍。
    坝区与山区结合起来，全面实行高产多收与多种多收以后，引起了一系列新的变化。全县粮食的总产量每年都获得大幅度的增长。过去，山区田地只有二万多亩，1956年以后，共开了四万多亩荒地。因此，去年的粮食总产量比1954年增加了一倍多。
    这五年中间，全县先后发生了十几次旱、涝、虫、病、风、霜、洪、雹等灾害，曾经有小面积的粮食因受灾减产，但是，由于耕地面积扩大了，全县的粮食总产量平均每年仍然递增15％至20％。1958年?江县发生了几十年未见的大旱，而粮食仍然增产。今年，全县又有二百六十多天没有下过透雨，旱象更加严重，由于气温高，又带来了大虫灾。但是，由于全县三百多个生产队采取坝区与山区相结合，集中力量打歼灭战的办法，做到及时防灾抗灾，因此，使今年的庄稼仍然长得很好。（附图片）
