Xinhua News Agency, 5th: Asuncion dispatch: Leaders of the Paraguayan Communist Party recently issued a statement on the anti-dictatorial armed struggle that broke out in Paraguay last December. The statement believes that the democratic movement in Paraguay has begun a new period, namely the period of armed struggle to overthrow the anti-national military regime. The statement pointed out that the period of armed struggle must include a stage of fierce armed activity as well as a stage of re-gathering and preparing revolutionary forces. At present, Paraguay is in a stage of re-gathering and preparing the social, political, and armed forces of the revolution.

The statement pointed out that the high tide of the anti-dictatorial struggle has two roots: the continuous aggravation of the economic crisis, which is a crisis of the entire semi-colonial and semi-feudal structure of Paraguay, and the new attitude of the broad masses toward the economic and political crisis. The statement said that following the cyclical inflation that impoverishes the people and shrinks the domestic market is the periodic restriction of currency circulation strictly promoted and supported by the International Monetary Fund. The consequences of restricting currency circulation are more severe than the consequences of inflation.

The statement pointed out that the so-called monetary "stability" does not actually exist. This is reflected in the resurgence of prices for necessities. Agricultural production is also declining, at least in certain basic projects such as cotton, tobacco, and corn.

The statement pointed out that the Paraguayan government restricts currency circulation by freezing agricultural product prices, freezing wages and salaries, increasing all taxes abnormally, and closing loans, sacrificing the interests of farmers, workers, the petty bourgeoisie, and the national bourgeoisie. All these factors have led to the shrinking of domestic and foreign markets. Unemployment is increasing. Hunger is spreading.

The statement revealed that the U.S. government demanded that the Paraguayan government legitimize itself through elections and allow the Liberal Party to participate in the House of Representatives as a condition for providing loans. The statement said that this shows that U.S. imperialism doubts the possibility of continuing to maintain the dictatorial regime in its old form and fears the anti-imperialist movement.

The statement said that the unprecedentedly sharp crisis has convinced the majority of the Paraguayan people that it is impossible to solve the economic chaos and hunger without eliminating the dictatorial regime. The people's desire to fight is strong. Many people have expressed their determination to take up arms against the dictatorial regime. That is to say, the people are waiting for the start of the armed struggle, and a large part of them are ready to actively participate in this battle.

The statement pointed out that the people's consciousness has made significant progress in several aspects. They are clearer than before about the role of the Americans as supporters of the dictatorial regime and enemies of the revolution. Another aspect of the progress of people's consciousness in recent years is the formation of the concept that the unity of anti-dictatorial forces is a necessary condition for achieving victory. The people hope for unity.

The statement said that the masses have confirmed through their own experience that the peaceful road, which Stroessner is currently using as a major propaganda slogan at the request of the U.S. government, is impossible.

The statement said that the prominent fact in the workers' movement is that workers have increasingly realized that it is impossible to solve some of the current difficult problems unless the current government is overthrown and a democratic government is established. Railway workers have stood up against the threat of mass layoffs, fighting for higher wages and the signing of labor contracts. At a congress last November, workers openly stated that they would wage a struggle against the government until it was overthrown. This is a symbol of the gradual revolutionization of the workers' movement. The victory of unified candidate lists in a large number of union elections is another sign of the awakening of the working class consciousness.

The statement said that Communists must carry out active political work, raise the revolutionary consciousness of the workers' movement, and make the workers' movement the vanguard force of the entire revolutionary movement.

Speaking of the peasants' attitude towards the anti-dictatorial armed struggle, the statement pointed out that the peasants' attitude is generally sympathetic to the guerrillas who entered Paraguay armed on December 12 last year. Only a few National Republican Party workers and farmers obeyed the orders of the National Republican Party and offered to serve in the city guard.

The statement then analyzed the various forces of the reactionary group and the anti-dictatorial front. The statement pointed out that the ruling class of Paraguay, composed of large estate owners, especially landlords (cattle breeders), large importers, and imperialist agents, is divided into three factions. The division of the ruling class into three parts is a favorable situation for the revolution. It seriously weakens the anti-national military regime, which is currently the direct basis of the rule of imperialism, especially U.S. imperialism. Its military machine tends to split and disintegrate. This especially helps to separate the mass base of the dictatorial regime, formerly composed of National Republican Party farmers and workers, from it. After the great struggles of May and June last year, the dictatorial regime was politically isolated and caused a split in the National Republican Party.

The statement pointed out that the mainstay of the dictatorial regime's armed struggle is mainly U.S. imperialism abroad. Domestically, it is mainly the army. The statement said that the United States will help Stroessner militarily and will mobilize the Organization of American States to blockade the source of the revolution and prevent them from obtaining supplies and assistance from foreign countries.

The statement pointed out that the heads of the army supporting the dictatorial regime are divided into three factions, one of which supports the U.S. Embassy's "gradual democratization." If a major armed movement occurs that threatens Stroessner's stability, these factions may act to organize a military government in an attempt to prevent the revolution. The U.S. Embassy will participate in organizing this preventative coup.

The statement then talked about the strength of the revolutionary camp. The statement said that the characteristic of the current development process is that these forces are gathering at both ends. On the one hand is the revolutionary right wing. On the other hand is the revolutionary left wing. The statement pointed out that it is no longer possible for the national bourgeoisie and the petty bourgeoisie of the intelligentsia to stand at the forefront of the revolution in Paraguay, because they are very afraid of "communism," that is, afraid of the masses, afraid of revolution, and also afraid of imperialism.

The "May 14th Movement" is also an organization of the bourgeoisie and the petty bourgeoisie, and it has actually turned to the right. Since the failure of the "invasion" last December, the leadership of this movement has been in a state of complete disintegration. Its supporters have largely lost their illusions, especially among the guerrillas, many of whom are increasingly close to the position of the National Liberation United Front.

The statement said that the Paraguayan Communist Party's attitude towards the "May 14th Movement" is to unite the democratic leaders of this movement who advocate unity, and gradually isolate the reactionary and adventurous enemies in this movement, in order to take unified action in the anti-dictatorial armed struggle.

The statement emphasized that in Paraguay, the issue of proletarian leadership is linked to the issue of revolution. Without proletarian leadership, there would be no bourgeois revolution. The national bourgeoisie is under the protection of large import capitalists and the large estate owners of the Liberal Party.

The statement, in discussing the independent development of mass movements under the leadership of the Party, said that the independent development of such mass movements should be carried out through two paths: the armed path and the non-armed path. However, both paths point towards one goal: to launch a general uprising of the people. The armed path mainly involves rural guerrilla warfare, although some actions should also be taken in the cities to seize weapons and hinder certain enemy actions. The statement said that the non-armed path mainly involves the struggles of workers', peasants', and students' organizations. However, these struggles must be backed up by armed self-defense actions.

The statement pointed out that in order to create the conditions for a general uprising of the people, it is necessary to use all forms of struggle, from the most basic or legal struggles to armed forms of struggle, through the aforementioned two paths.

The statement pointed out that according to this policy, the Paraguayan Communist Party is working domestically in two aspects: organizing mass struggles for economic and democratic demands and organizing peasant guerrillas in certain areas.

The statement pointed out that the Paraguayan National Liberation United Front movement currently has many organizations at home and abroad, and it is the only existing organized unity movement, while the Communist Party is the only organized opposition party. The statement said that the Paraguayan Communist Party is confident that it will be good at guiding the masses towards a true revolution.

    巴拉圭共产党就人民反独裁武装斗争发表声明
    必须推翻独裁政权建立民主政府
    巴拉圭民主运动开始了为推翻反民族的军事政权而进行武装斗争的时期——巴拉圭人民更加认清美帝国主义是独裁政权的支持者——在巴拉圭，没有无产阶级的领导，就没有资产阶级革命——党所领导的群众运动的目标是发动人民的总起义
    新华社5日讯  亚松森消息：巴拉圭共产党领导人不久前发表了关于去年12月在巴拉圭爆发的反独裁武装斗争的声明。声明认为巴拉圭的民主运动已经开始了一个新的时期，即为推翻反民族的军事政权而进行武装斗争的时期。声明指出，武装斗争的时期必需包括激烈的武装活动阶段以及革命力量的重新集结和准备的阶段。目前，巴拉圭处在一个重新集结和准备革命的社会、政治和武装力量的阶段中。
    声明指出，反独裁斗争高潮的根源有二：经济危机的不断严重化，这是巴拉圭半殖民地和半封建的全部结构的危机，和广大群众对经济和政治危机的新态度。声明说，随着使人民日益贫穷和使国内市场缩小的周期性通货膨胀接踵而来的是国际货币基金组织所严厉推行和支持的周期地限制货币流通。限制货币流通所造成后果比通货膨胀的后果更加恶劣。
    声明指出，所谓的货币“稳定”实际上并不存在。这反映为生活必需品的再度上涨。农业生产也在下降，至少是在棉花、烟草、玉米等某些基本项目中下降了。
    声明指出，巴拉圭政府限制货币流通是通过冻结农产品价格、冻结工资和薪金，脱离常轨的增加一切税收和关闭贷款的办法，牺牲农民、工人、小资产阶级、和民族资产阶级的利益执行的。这一切因素引起了国内外市场的缩小。失业现象在增加。饥饿在扩展。
    声明揭露，美国政府以提供贷款作为条件要巴拉圭政府通过选举使自己合法化，让自由党参加众议院。声明说，这表明，美帝国主义怀疑在旧形式下继续维持独裁政权的可能性，害怕反帝运动。
    声明说，空前尖锐的危机使巴拉圭全国大多数人相信不消灭独裁政权就不可能解决经济混乱和饥饿的现象。人民进行斗争的愿望很强烈。很多人表示他们决心拿起武器，反对独裁政权。这也就是说，人民等待武装斗争的开始，很大一部分人准备积极参加这个战斗。
    声明指出，人民觉悟在好几个方面有了重大的进展。他们对美国人作为独裁政权的支持者和革命敌人的作用比以前更加清楚了。最近几年来人民觉悟进展的另一方面，是反独裁力量的团结是取得胜利的必要条件这一概念的形成。人民希望团结。
    声明说，群众通过自己的经验证实，斯特罗斯纳目前在美国政府要求下作为主要宣传口号的和平道路是不可能的。
    声明说，在工人运动中突出的事实是，工人已日益看清，如果不推翻现政府，建立一个民主政府，当前的一些困难问题是不可能解决的。铁路工人已站立起来反对大批解雇工人的威胁，争取提高工资和签订劳工合同。在去年11月的一次代表大会上，工人们公开表示要进行反对政府的斗争，直到把它推翻为止。这是工人运动逐渐革命化的象征。在一大批工会选举中，统一候选名单的胜利是工人阶级觉悟觉醒的另一个标志。
    声明说，共产党人必须进行积极的政治工作，提高工人运动的革命觉悟，并使工人运动成为全部革命运动的先进力量。
    谈到农民对反独裁武装斗争的态度时，声明指出，农民的态度一般的说是同情去年12月12日武装进入巴拉圭的游击队员的。只有少数国家共和党的工人和农民服从国家共和党的命令，提出愿为城市警卫队服务。
    声明接着分析了反动集团和反独裁阵线的各种力量。声明指出，巴拉圭由大庄园主，特别是地主（牛的饲养者），大进口商和帝国主义代理人组成的统治阶级分成三派。统治阶级分裂为三部分是一种对革命有利的情况。它严重地削弱了反民族的军事政权，这个政权目前是帝国主义、特别是美帝国主义统治的直接基础。它的军事机器趋向分裂和瓦解。这尤其有助于使独裁政权过去由国家共和党的农民和工人组成的群众基础与它分离。在去年5月和6月的伟大斗争之后，独裁政权在政治上孤立了，并引起了国家共和党的分裂。
    声明指出，独裁政权进行武装斗争的支柱在国外主要是美帝国主义。在国内主要是军队。声明说，美国将在军事上帮助斯特罗斯纳，并将动员美洲国家组织来封锁革命的策源地和防止它们从外国得到供应和援助。
    声明指出，在支持独裁政权的军队中的首脑分三派，其中有一派支持美国大使馆的“逐步民主化”。如果发生重大的武装运动，威胁到斯特罗斯纳的稳定，可能这些派别行动起来组织一个军政府，以图阻止革命。美国大使馆将参与组织这个预防性的政变。
    声明接着谈到革命阵营的力量。声明说，目前发展过程的特点是这些力量正在两端集聚。一方面是革命的右派。另一方面是革命的左派。声明指出，民族资产阶级和知识界的小资产阶级在巴拉圭已经不可能站在革命的前列，因为他们非常害怕“共产主义”，也就说是害怕群众，害怕革命，并且还害怕帝国主义。
  “5月14日运动”也是一个资产阶级和小资产阶级的组织，它实际上已转到右派的立场。自从去年12月
  “入侵”失败后，这个运动的领导处于完全解体的状态中。它的拥护者在很大程度上消失了幻想，特别是在游击队员中间，他们中的很多人日益接近民族解放联合阵线的立场。
    声明说，巴拉圭共产党对“5月14日运动”的态度是，团结这个运动的主张团结的民主领导人，逐步孤立这个运动中的反动和冒险的敌人，以便在反独裁武装斗争中采取统一行动。
    声明强调指出，在巴拉圭，无产阶级领导权的问题是与革命问题联系在一起的，没有无产阶级的领导，就没有资产阶级革命。民族资产阶级置身于大进口资产阶级及自由党大庄园主的保护之下。
    声明在谈到在党的领导下独立地开展群众运动时说，这种群众运动的独立发展应该通过两条道路进行：武装的道路和非武装的道路。但是，两条道路向着一个目标：发动人民的总起义。武装的道路主要是搞农村游击战，虽然在城市中也应采取某些行动，夺取武器和阻碍某些敌人的行动。声明说，非武装的道路主要是工人、农民和学生组织的斗争。但是，这些斗争必须有武装自卫行动作后盾。
    声明指出，为了创造人民总起义的条件，需要通过上述两条道路，运用一切斗争形式，从最基本的或合法斗争的到武装的斗争形式。
    声明指出，根据这个方针，巴拉圭共产党在国内从两个方面进行工作：组织争取经济和民主要求的群众斗争以及在某些地区组织农民游击队。
    声明指出，巴拉圭民族解放联合阵线运动目前在国内和国外都有许多组织，它是现有的唯一有组织的团结运动，而共产党则是唯一的有组织的反对党。声明说，巴拉圭共产党确信，它将善于引导群众走向一次真正的革命。
