    Mobilize the Masses, Act Swiftly, Promote Advanced Experience in Saving Coal
    Hebei's Various Sectors Make Every Effort to Save Coal
    Shaoxing Steel Plant Launches "No Crushed Coke" Campaign to Promote High-Quality, High-Yield, and Low-Consumption Coke Production
    Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin – Hebei Province is making every effort to save coal in various sectors, saving more good coal to support industrial and agricultural production.
    Hebei Province is one of China's major coal-producing areas and is responsible for supplying coal to the whole country. While vigorously increasing coal production, the province's major factories, mines, enterprises, and organizations have established leading groups for saving coal. They are combining discussions on increasing production and saving plans, mobilizing workers to overcome the idea that "we have a large enterprise and lots of coal, so wasting a little doesn't matter," and formulating specific plans and measures for saving coal.
    In the smelting industry, which uses the most coal, many areas such as Tangshan and Handan, coke plants and iron plants, have recently mobilized the masses to discover great potential for saving coal. After adopting measures to save raw coal, reduce coal consumption, and improve the recovery rate of refined coal, the coke plants in Shijiazhuang City saved more than 16,000 tons of raw coal in the past month or so. Many iron-smelting plant workers have launched a competition to use less coke and produce more iron. Zhangjiakou Gaojiatun Iron Plant established a system of determining materials based on the furnace, calculating costs based on the furnace, announcing results by shift, and saving the surplus independently. This has motivated the vast number of workers. Since August, the average coke consumption per ton of iron produced has been significantly reduced compared to July.
    Industries such as power, light industry, chemical industry, machinery, and building materials are also following the spirit of "increasing production without increasing coal consumption, and burning more white coal and inferior coal." They are mobilizing the masses, transforming boilers, improving kiln types, improving operations, and vigorously promoting advanced experiences in coal gasification to save coal. Tianjin State-owned No. 2 Cotton Mill Power Plant created the successful experience of transforming large chain boilers to burn anthracite coal entirely. This advanced experience has been quickly promoted. More than 30 large and medium-sized thermal power plants in the province have improved coal combustion methods and adjusted equipment. Recently, the average coal consumption per kilowatt-hour has been reduced by 6% compared to before. Many units have established a set of coal-saving systems and assessment systems.
    Urban and rural public canteens, commercial and catering service industries are also vigorously innovating stoves and improving operations to save coal. Many units have changed cooking stoves to "Longdao Double-Connected Stoves," "Universal Stoves," and "Nine-Eye Satellite Stoves," which consume less coal and generate more heat. These stoves can widely utilize coal slime, coal balls, and coal fines, greatly reducing coal consumption. For example, the collective canteen of Tianjin No. 17 Middle School, which serves more than 300 people, uses one forced-air "Longdao Double-Connected Stove" and one forced-air high stove, with an average daily coal consumption of only one or two liang and three qian per person.

    This newspaper, Hangzhou, 8th dispatch. Zhejiang Shaoxing Steel Plant is vigorously carrying out a "No Crushed Coke" mass movement, which has powerfully promoted the overall leap forward of high-quality, high-yield and low-consumption coke and pig iron. In the recent ten days, they have increased the coking rate of coke by 4.2%, reduced raw coal consumption by 9%, reduced coke sulfur content by 3.24%, reduced moisture content by 2.14%, and increased coke production by 17.7%. Due to the significant improvement in the quality of coke, the utilization coefficient of the blast furnace has increased by 8.4%, and the qualified rate of pig iron has reached more than 90%.
    The factory's employees took the initiative in increasing production and economizing, regarding the exploration of coke potential as an important key to increasing steel production. To this end, under the leadership of the Party organization, all employees of the factory made three detailed accounts of coal consumption for coke production, coking rate, and transportation losses, thus uncovering great potential for increasing production and economizing. On this basis, all processes throughout the factory launched a competition to tackle key problems to ensure "no crushed coke." Employees in the coal blending, coal washing, crushing, preheating, coking, and coke removal processes all contributed to "no crushed coke," made mutual guarantees, transmitted war reports, and collaborated. In addition, the advanced experience of pacesetter furnaces has been widely promoted in all twelve simple coke ovens in the factory, greatly reducing raw coal losses during the coking and coke removal processes.

    绍兴钢铁厂开展“无碎焦”运动促进焦炭优质高产低消耗
    新华社天津电　河北省各行各业千方百计节约用煤，节省出更多的好煤来支援工农业生产。
    河北省是我国主要产煤区之一，担负着供应全国煤炭的任务。全省在大力增产煤炭的同时，各大厂矿企业、机关团体都成立了节约用煤领导小组，结合讨论增产节约计划，发动职工克服“家大业大煤多，浪费点不算啥”的思想，订出节约用煤的具体计划和措施。
    用煤最多的冶炼业，如唐山、邯郸等许多地区的焦厂、铁厂，最近都发动群众挖掘出了许多节约煤炭的潜力。石家庄市各炼焦厂采取节约原煤、降低煤耗、提高精煤回收率等措施以后，最近一个多月就节约了原煤一万六千多吨。许多炼铁厂职工开展了少用焦、多炼铁的竞赛。张家口高家屯铁厂建立了以炉定料、以炉核算、按班公布、节约自存的制度，调动了广大职工的积极性，8月份以来平均生产每吨铁的耗焦量比7月份有了显著降低。
    电力、轻工、化工、机械、建筑材料等行业，也本着“增产不增煤，多烧白煤和次煤”的精神，发动群众，改造锅炉，改进窑型，改进操作，大力推行煤气化等节约煤炭先进经验。天津国棉二厂发电厂创造了改造大型链条锅炉，全部改烧无烟煤的成功经验。这项先进经验很快得到推广，全省三十多座大中型火力发电厂改进了煤炭燃烧方法，调整了设备，最近平均每度电耗煤量比以前降低了6％。不少单位已经建立起一套节约用煤制度和考核制度。
    城乡公共食堂、商业和饮食服务行业也在大力革新炉灶，改进操作，以节约煤炭。很多单位把炊事用灶改成耗煤少、热量大的“龙道二连灶”、“万能灶”、“九眼卫星灶”等，可以广泛利用煤泥、煤球、煤末等，大量地降低了煤炭消耗。如天津市十七中学三百多人的集体食堂，用一个吹风“龙道二连灶”和一个吹风高灶，平均每人每日耗煤量才一两三钱。
    本报杭州8日电　浙江绍兴钢铁厂大搞“无碎焦”群众运动，有力地促进了焦炭、生铁的优质高产和低消耗的全面跃进。在最近的十天之内，他们把焦炭的结焦率提高了4.2％，原煤消耗降低9％，焦炭硫分下降3.24％，水分下降2.14％，焦的产量提高17.7％，由于焦炭质量显著提高，高炉利用系数提高了8.4％，生铁合格率已达到90％以上。
    这个厂的职工在增产节约运动中把挖掘焦炭潜力作为增产钢铁的重要关键。为此，全厂职工在党组织的领导下，从炼焦耗煤量、结焦率和运输损耗等方面算了三笔细账，从而挖出了很大的增产节约的潜力。在这一基础上，全厂道道工序便展开了保证“无碎焦”的攻关竞赛。配煤、洗煤、粉碎、预热、炼焦和出焦等工序的职工，都为“无碎焦”而出力，相互提保证，传送战表，共同协作。此外，全厂十二座简易焦炉还普遍推广了标兵炉的先进经验，大大减少了炼焦、出焦过程中的原煤损耗。
