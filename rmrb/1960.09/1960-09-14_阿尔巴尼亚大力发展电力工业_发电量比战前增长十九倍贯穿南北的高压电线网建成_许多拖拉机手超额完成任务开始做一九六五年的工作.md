Xinhua News Agency, Tirana, 11th: Albania's current power generation has increased nineteenfold compared to 1938, before liberation.

On a per capita basis, Albania's electricity production surpassed neighboring Turkey as early as 1957.

Before liberation, Albania only had a few very small thermal power plants in cities like Tirana. But today, the country has six thermal power plants and two hydroelectric power plants, including the Marx Hydroelectric Station built on the Mati River, which has a generating capacity of 25,000 kilowatts and an annual power generation of 120 million kilowatt-hours. Albania has also built a high-voltage power grid from north to south, connecting the power stations in the central region into a whole, supplying cheap power to industrial sectors such as textiles, petroleum, mining, and food. At the same time, Albania has built small power stations in more than 150 rural villages. Among the 65 small power stations in the Korça region, 36 were built by the farmers themselves.

According to the economic construction plan, Albania is building two hydroelectric power stations with a generating capacity of 50,000 kilowatts each and some small and medium-sized power stations.

Xinhua News Agency, Tirana, 13th: According to the Albanian Telegraph Agency, many tractor drivers in Albania are already working on tasks for 1965, and some have even completed the Third Five-Year Plan, which will not begin until next year.

Socialist Labor Hero, Hekri Kanapari, a tractor driver from the Kavaja Machine Tractor Station, is a prominent example. He is currently working on the fourth quarter of 1967.

Kanapari has been driving a tractor for eleven years. During this period, he completed the amount of work that would normally take eighteen years to complete. This nationally renowned tractor driver not only overfulfills his plans, but also takes excellent care of his tractor. In 1954, he received a "DT-54" tractor and guaranteed to cultivate 12,000 hectares of land with this tractor without needing a major overhaul.

Maintaining tractors well has become a movement in Albania. The initiator of this movement is Buto Isufi, a tractor driver and Socialist Labor Hero from the Shkodër region. He was the first to achieve the guarantee of cultivating 12,000 hectares of land with a tractor without needing a major overhaul. He recently proposed another guarantee that by the end of 1961, he will complete the plan for 1970.

    阿尔巴尼亚大力发展电力工业
    发电量比战前增长十九倍贯穿南北的高压电线网建成
    许多拖拉机手超额完成任务开始做一九六五年的工作
    新华社地拉那11日电　阿尔巴尼亚目前的发电量比解放前的1938年增长了十九倍。
    按人口平均计算，阿尔巴尼亚的电力生产早在1957年就超过了邻近的土耳其。
    解放前阿尔巴尼亚只在地拉那等几个城市有几个规模极小的火力发电站。但今天，全国已有六座火力发电站、两座水力发电站，其中建筑在马蒂河上的马克思水电站的发电能力达二万五千瓩，全年发电量为一亿二千万度。阿尔巴尼亚还建成了由北到南的高压电线网，使中部地区的电力站联成了一个整体，向纺织、石油、采矿和食品等工业部门供应廉价的动力。同时，阿尔巴尼亚有一百五十多个农村建造了小型发电站。科尔察区的六十五个小型发电站中就有三十六个是农民自行建造的。
    根据经济建设计划，阿尔巴尼亚正在兴建发电能力达五万瓩的两座水力发电站和一些中小型发电站。
    新华社地拉那13日电　据阿尔巴尼亚通讯社报道，目前阿尔巴尼亚有很多拖拉机手已经在做1965年的工作，有些人甚至已经完成了明年才开始的第三个五年计划。
    社会主义劳动英雄、卡伐亚机器拖拉机站的拖拉机手希克里·卡纳帕里就是一个显著的例子。他现在正在做1967年第四季度的工作。
    卡纳帕里驾驶拖拉机已有十一年的历史。在这期间，他完成了按规定需要十八年才能完成的工作量。这位闻名全国的拖拉机手不仅超额完成计划，而且还把拖拉机照管得非常好。1954年，他领到一部“德特—五四”型拖拉机，他保证用这台拖拉机耕地一万二千公顷，而不需要大修。
    很好地维护拖拉机在阿尔巴尼亚已经成为一个运动。这个运动的倡议者是斯库台区的一个拖拉机手、社会主义劳动英雄布托·伊苏菲。他首先实现了用拖拉机耕地一万二千公顷土地而不需要大修的保证。他最近又提出保证，到1961年底要完成1970年的计划。
