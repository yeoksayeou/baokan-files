	Early
	Early in the morning, a hundred early steps are early, the character "early" is on horseback to promote the good. Start early during the Limit of Heat; deliver fertilizer early to remove weeds early, repair plows and rakes early, prepare medicine early for soaking wheat seeds early, repair carts early to tie ropes early, sharpen sickles early to forge hoes early, let crops ripen early and harvest early, harvest early to plow early and harrow well early, plant early before the White Dew, plant as much and as early as possible. Let the wheat fields roll with green waves early, let the wheat mountains pierce the clouds early.

    早
    申身一早百早步步早，早字上马早促好。早在处暑早动手；早送肥来早除草，早修犁耙早修耧，早浸麦种早备药，早修大车早结绳，早磨镰刀早打镐，庄稼早熟早收割，早割早耕早耙好，早在白露前插耧，能种多早种多早。早叫麦田滚绿浪，早让麦山穿云霄。
