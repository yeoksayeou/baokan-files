    Shandong Holds Academic Symposium on the Sixtieth Anniversary of the Boxer Rebellion

    The Shandong Provincial Historical Society and the History Research Institute of the Shandong Branch of the Chinese Academy of Sciences recently jointly held an academic symposium in Jinan on the sixtieth anniversary of the Boxer Rebellion. Historians from nearly forty institutions, including history departments of universities and historical research institutions from sixteen provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions across the country, participated in the conference. More than thirty research papers on the Boxer Rebellion and survey data on the activities of the Boxers in various regions were presented and discussed at the meeting.

    In the spirit of "Letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend," this symposium discussed some theoretical issues concerning the Boxer Rebellion. Regarding the nature of the Boxer Rebellion, most people believed that, considering the primary contradiction in Chinese society at that time, the Boxer Rebellion was a product of the deepening imperialist aggression and unprecedented national disaster. The Boxer Rebellion was a patriotic movement against imperialism, mainly composed of peasants, and the war waged by the Boxers was an anti-imperialist, revolutionary, and progressive war. Regarding the historical significance and role of the Boxer Rebellion, most people believed that the Boxer Rebellion prevented the imperialist powers from partitioning China, struck a blow to the feudal ruling forces, and powerfully promoted the progress of Chinese history, writing a glorious page in the history of Chinese national liberation. During the discussion, differing opinions were raised regarding the views expressed in individual articles that minimized the anti-imperialist significance of the Boxer Rebellion and belittled the role of the Boxer Rebellion. The attendees generally believed that these articles and survey data received by the conference, as well as the discussions at the conference, would contribute to the future development of scientific research on the history of the Boxer Rebellion and modern Chinese history.

    The attendees also believed that conducting research on the Boxer Rebellion has practical significance. Although the Boxer Rebellion has passed for sixty years, the imperialist nature of aggression and plunder has not changed, and opposing imperialism, especially American imperialism, remains the most important task of the Chinese people today. Marxist historical science must serve proletarian politics. Historical researchers must contribute their strength to the struggle against imperialism, especially against American imperialism, through their work.

    Guo Dongchen, an eighty-year-old man, spoke at the academic symposium. He had served as the secretary of Zhao Sanduo, one of the leaders of the Boxer Rebellion in Shandong Province.

    山东举行关于义和团运动六十周年的学术讨论会
    山东省历史学会和中国科学院山东分院历史研究所最近在济南联合举办了关于义和团运动六十周年的学术讨论会，全国十六个省、市、自治区的高等院校历史系和历史研究机构近四十个单位的史学工作者参加了这次会议。提到会上讨论的关于义和团运动的研究论文和义和团在各地区活动的调查资料有三十多篇。
    这次讨论会以百家争鸣的精神，对于义和团运动的一些理论问题进行了讨论。关于义和团运动的性质，大多数人认为，从当时中国社会主要矛盾来看，义和团乃是帝国主义侵略加深、民族灾难空前严重的产物。义和团运动是一个以农民为主体的反对帝国主义的爱国运动，义和团进行的战争是反对帝国主义的、革命的、进步的战争。关于义和团运动的历史意义、作用问题，大多数人认为，义和团运动阻止了帝国主义列强瓜分中国，打击了封建统治势力，有力地推动了中国历史前进，在中国民族解放史上写下了光辉的一页。讨论中对个别文章缩小义和团反对帝国主义的意义，贬低义和团运动的作用的观点，提出了不同的意见。到会的人普遍认为，大会收到的这些文章和调查资料以及会上的讨论，有助于今后对义和团运动史和中国近代史的科学研究工作的开展。
    到会的人还认为，对义和团运动进行研究是有现实意义的。虽然义和团运动已经过去了六十年，但帝国主义的侵略的掠夺的本性没有改变，反对帝国主义、特别是反对美帝国主义仍是今天中国人民头等重要的任务。马克思主义的历史科学必须为无产阶级政治服务。历史研究者必须通过自己的工作在反对帝国主义、特别在反对美帝国主义的斗争中贡献出力量。
    八十岁老人郭栋臣在学术讨论会上发言，他曾担任过山东省义和团领袖之一的赵三多的秘书。
