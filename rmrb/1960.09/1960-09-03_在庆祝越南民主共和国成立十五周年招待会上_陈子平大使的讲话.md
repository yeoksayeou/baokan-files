Xinhua News Agency, 2nd. September. Ambassador Chen Ziping of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam gave the following speech at the reception celebrating the 15th anniversary of the founding of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam:
	Dear Chairman Liu, Comrades, Friends:
	Today, we are celebrating the "September 2nd" festival - the 15th anniversary of the founding of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam - with incomparable joy and excitement. On behalf of the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and the Vietnamese people, we would like to express our heartfelt thanks to the comrades and friends for their enthusiastic attendance at the reception celebrating the great festival of our people.
	In August 1945, when the powerful Soviet Union had just defeated the German and Japanese fascists, the Vietnamese people, under the leadership of the working-class party, united as one and stood up to crush the rule of the French and Japanese fascists, as well as the feudal monarchy, thereby winning the victory of the August Revolution and establishing the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. This is the most glorious day for the Vietnamese nation, and it is a victory of the creative application of Marxism-Leninism in a colonial and semi-feudal country.
	Not long after the success of the Vietnamese August Revolution, the French colonialists, with the help of imperialism and international reactionaries, re-ignited a war of aggression full of crimes, attempting to strangle the young Democratic Republic of Vietnam and vainly trying to impose the yoke of slavery on the Vietnamese people once again.
	Despite being in extremely difficult circumstances, the Vietnamese people still stood up resolutely to fight against the colonialists' aggression, determined not to be slaves again. Thanks to the close unity of the people throughout the country, their heroic fighting, their spirit of selfless sacrifice, and the enthusiastic support of socialist countries, peace-loving countries, and people around the world, the Vietnamese people have achieved final victory. The French colonialists and American interventionists have suffered a shameful defeat. After the Dien Bien Phu campaign in 1954, they were forced to sit down and negotiate and sign the Geneva armistice agreement, recognizing the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the countries of Indochina. This was the first time in history that a weak colonial country finally defeated a powerful imperialist country. This shows that no matter how weak a nation is, when it is awakened under the leadership of the working-class party and masters its own destiny, it will surely be able to achieve victory in the cause of national liberation and defending the motherland, which no reactionary force can stop.
	After the restoration of peace, with the motherland still temporarily divided, the Vietnamese people carried forward the heroic tradition of the August Revolution to complete the construction of socialism in North Vietnam as a backing for the struggle for national reunification. The Vietnamese people have overcome all kinds of hardships and difficulties and have brilliantly completed the three-year plan for economic recovery and the three-year plan for economic transformation and development.
	After completing land reform, freeing 13 million peasants from feudal rule, we then carried out the socialist transformation of agriculture, handicrafts, and capitalist industry and commerce, and will basically complete this task by the end of 1960.
	Regarding agricultural production, the total output value has increased by 52.6%. The per capita rice output has increased from 210 kilograms before the war to 350 kilograms in 1960, ranking first among rice-producing countries in Southeast Asia. North Vietnam has not only solved the problem of perennial food shortages that have plagued it for thousands of years, but also has hundreds of thousands of tons of surplus grain for export. In terms of industrial production, the Vietnamese people have also made great achievements. Thanks to the generous and selfless assistance of the Soviet Union, China, and other fraternal socialist countries, we have strived to establish a new production base with modern equipment while restoring the old production base. In the whole of North Vietnam, there were only 19 industrial enterprises at the end of 1954, but by 1959, there were 152 large and medium-sized industrial enterprises. In 1960, another 72 large and medium-sized industrial enterprises will be built, in addition to hundreds of local industrial enterprises. The total output value of industry and handicrafts in 1960 has increased three times compared with 1955. If we only consider industry, it has increased seven times, and state-owned industry has increased sixteen times.
	Due to the continuous development of production, the material and cultural life of the people has been continuously improved, the real wages of workers have increased by 55%, and the per capita national income has doubled. Great achievements have also been made in culture, education, and health. In 1958, North Vietnam basically eliminated illiteracy. As of now, students in preschool classes and ordinary schools account for 16% of the total population of North Vietnam, an increase of five times compared with the total number of students in the whole of Indochina before. The number of university students in North Vietnam is currently thirteen times more than the number of university students in the whole of Indochina in the year with the highest number in 1939.
	The above-mentioned great achievements are due to the correct leadership of the Vietnamese Labor Party headed by the respected President Ho Chi Minh. These achievements are inseparable from the selfless assistance of the Soviet Union, China, and other fraternal socialist countries, as well as the enthusiastic support of the world's workers' movement and the national liberation movement and the peace and democratic movement around the world.
	While we, the people of North Vietnam, are rejoicing over the significant achievements we have made in building socialism in North Vietnam, the people of South Vietnam are living under the dark rule of the fascist regime of the American Ngo Dinh Diem clique. American imperialism and its servants and running dogs are turning South Vietnam into a new type of colony and military base, attempting to use South Vietnam as a springboard for launching a new war and undermining peace in Vietnam, Southeast Asia, and the world. They blatantly violate the Geneva Accords, directly establish, train, and equip the South Vietnamese army, and control the command of the South Vietnamese army through various military advisory groups. Although peace has been restored for six years, South Vietnam has not had a single day without the sound of gunfire and artillery, and not a single day without bloodshed. That is the sound of gunfire and artillery from the South Vietnamese Ngo Dinh Diem army, directly commanded by American generals and advisors, massacring the Vietnamese people. Because the American Ngo Dinh Diem clique implements policies of persecution, oppression, exploitation, and impoverishment of the people in South Vietnam, the lives of the people in South Vietnam are very difficult. Industrial and agricultural production in South Vietnam has stagnated, unemployment is increasing, and the cost of living is rising. The rule of American imperialism and its running dogs is the root cause of all the hardships and disasters that our people in South Vietnam are forced to endure. Therefore, the Vietnamese people have risen up in unison to resolutely fight against American imperialism. Because opposing American imperialism is defending peace, striving for and defending national independence and sovereignty, and fighting for human freedom, democracy, and progress. The Vietnamese people are willing to resolutely fight against American imperialist aggressors together with the people of the world. We firmly believe that victory will surely belong to the Vietnamese people, and the cause of peaceful reunification of Vietnam will surely be realized. The Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam has always faithfully and solemnly fulfilled the Geneva Accords and insisted on struggling for the reunification of the motherland through peaceful means.
	Comrades, Friends:
	The struggle of our Vietnamese people is being carried out in a very favorable world situation. The strength of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union is growing stronger and stronger and increasingly overwhelming the forces of imperialism. The national liberation movement is developing more and more vigorously and has successively achieved victories in many countries in Asia, Africa, and Latin America. American imperialism is becoming increasingly isolated. The forces of world peace are overwhelming the forces of war, and the possibility of maintaining peace and preventing a new world war is increasing. However, the Vietnamese people have realized more and more clearly through six years of struggle against the conspiracies and actions of American imperialism in South Vietnam that as long as imperialism exists, the source of aggressive war still exists. At present, the imperialist group headed by American imperialism is continuing to create a cold war situation, which is making the international situation tense again. But if the people of the world raise their vigilance and strengthen their unity and struggle, they will surely be able to smash the war conspiracies of American imperialism. The Vietnamese people and the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam are willing to make their own contributions to the cause of fighting against American imperialism and defending peace in Indochina and Southeast Asia and the world. The Vietnamese people and the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam fully support the Soviet Union's peaceful foreign policy and all the Soviet Union's initiatives aimed at easing the international situation, as well as the Soviet government's proposal for comprehensive and thorough disarmament. We regard further strengthening the solidarity and unity between the Soviet Union, China, and other fraternal socialist countries as the most important task. The Vietnamese people resolutely support the anti-American struggles of the people of China, Korea, Japan, and other countries around the world, and resolutely support the national liberation movements in Asia, Africa, and Latin America. The Vietnamese people pay special attention to the situation of neighboring countries and have always hoped to consolidate and develop friendship with these countries. The Government and people of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam resolutely support the policy of peace and neutrality pursued by the Cambodian government under the leadership of Head of State Prince Norodom Sihanouk. The Vietnamese people warmly support the just struggle of the Lao people for the realization of genuine peace and neutrality in Laos against American imperialist intervention.
	Comrades, Friends:
	China and Vietnam are fraternal countries and have had close relations since ancient times. In the years of arduous struggle against imperialist aggression, the fraternal Chinese people wholeheartedly supported the Vietnamese people. The People's Republic of China and the Soviet Union were the first countries to recognize the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and made significant contributions to the success of the Geneva Conference, thereby restoring peace in Indochina in 1954. Since the restoration of peace, the selfless and valuable assistance of the fraternal Chinese people has played a very important role in the Vietnamese people's cause of transforming and developing the economy. On this occasion, I would like to express my deep gratitude to the fraternal Chinese people on behalf of the Vietnamese people and the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. The Vietnamese people are extremely happy about the continuous great leap forward achievements made by the 650 million Chinese people under the wise leadership of the Communist Party of China headed by Chairman Mao Zedong in the past few years. These great achievements have contributed to strengthening the strength of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union and to defending world peace. The Vietnamese people and the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam resolutely support the People's Republic of China's peaceful and friendly foreign policy, which promotes the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, support all of China's peaceful initiatives, and support Premier Zhou Enlai's proposal that Asian and Pacific countries sign a treaty of non-aggression and turn the region into a nuclear-weapon-free zone.
	The Vietnamese people and the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam resolutely support the struggle of the fraternal Chinese people against American imperialist aggression and for the liberation of Taiwan, Chinese territory, resolutely oppose the conspiracy to create two Chinas, and demand that the People's Republic of China must enjoy its due status in the United Nations.
	The Vietnamese people sincerely congratulate the Chinese people on achieving many more great leap forward achievements under the brilliant light of the general line put forward by the Communist Party of China.
	I would like to propose a toast:
	To the unbreakable solidarity and friendship between the peoples of Vietnam and China,
	To the health of Chairman Liu Shaoqi of the People's Republic of China,
	To the unbreakable unity of the socialist camp countries headed by the great Soviet Union,
	To peace and friendship among all countries in the world,
	Cheers!

    在庆祝越南民主共和国成立十五周年招待会上
    陈子平大使的讲话
    新华社2日讯　越南民主共和国驻中国大使陈子平在庆祝越南民主共和国成立十五周年招待会上的讲话，全文如下：亲爱的刘主席，同志们，朋友们：
    今天，我们怀着无比愉快和兴奋的心情来庆祝“九·二”节——越南民主共和国成立十五周年。我们谨代表越南民主共和国政府和越南人民对同志们和朋友们热烈出席庆祝我国人民伟大节日的招待会，表示衷心的感谢。
    1945年8月，当强大的苏联刚打败德、日法西斯的时候，越南人民在工人阶级政党的领导下，万众一心地站起来粉碎了法、日法西斯的统治，以及封建主义皇朝，从而取得了八月革命的胜利，成立了越南民主共和国，这是越南民族最光荣的日子，这是在一个殖民地和半封建的国家里创造性地运用马克思列宁主义的胜利。
    越南八月革命成功后不多久，法国殖民主义者在帝国主义和国际反动派的帮助下，重新挑起罪恶累累的侵略战争，企图扼杀年轻的越南民主共和国，妄想再一次把奴隶的枷锁强加在越南人民的头上。
    尽管处在极其困难的环境中，越南人民仍然挺身而出，坚决地进行抗战，反对殖民主义者的侵略，决不甘心再做奴隶。由于全国人民紧密团结，英勇地战斗，发挥忘我牺牲精神，并且获得了社会主义国家，世界爱好和平的国家和人民的热情支持，越南人民已经取得了最后的胜利。法国殖民主义者和美国干涉者已经遭到了可耻的失败。1954年在奠边府战役之后，他们被迫坐下来谈判，并且签订日内瓦停战协议，承认印度支那各国的主权和领土完整，这是历史上第一次、一个弱小的殖民地国家终于战胜了一个强大的帝国主义国家。从这一点表明尽管是一个如何弱小的民族，当它在工人阶级政党领导下觉醒起来，主宰着自己命运的时候，就一定能够在解放民族和保卫祖国的事业中取得胜利，这是任何反动势力所不能拦阻的。
    和平恢复以后，在祖国还暂时被分割的情况下，越南人民又发扬了八月革命的英勇传统，以完成在越南北方建设社会主义，作为争取祖国统一斗争的后盾。越南人民克服了一切艰苦和困难，辉煌地完成了恢复经济的三年计划，以及改造和发展经济的三年计划。
    在完成了土地改革，使一千三百万农民摆脱封建主义的统治之后，接着我们进行了农业、手工业和资本主义工商业的社会主义改造，并将在1960年底基本上完成这个任务。
    关于农业生产方面，总产值增加了52.6％，按人口平均计算稻谷产量已从战前的二百一十公斤提高到1960年的三百五十公斤，跃居东南亚产稻国家的首位。越南北方不仅已经解决了过去几千年来常年缺粮的问题，而且还有几十万吨余粮出口。在工业生产方面，越南人民也取得了巨大的成就。由于得到苏联、中国和其他兄弟的社会主义国家的慷慨无私的帮助，我们在恢复旧的生产基础的同时，已努力建立新的现代化装备的生产基础。全越南北方在1954年底只有十九个工业企业，而到1959年就拥有一百五十二个大、中型工业企业，1960年又将建设七十二个大、中型工业企业，另外还有成百个地方工业企业。1960年的工业、手工业总产值已比1955年增加了三倍，如单以工业来说则增加了七倍，国营工业增加了十六倍。
    由于生产的不断发展，人民群众的物质和文化生活日益获得改善，职工的实际工资增加了55％，按人口平均计算，国民收入增加了一倍。文化、教育和卫生部门也都获得了巨大的成就。1958年，全越南北方已基本上肃清了文盲。截至目前为止，学前班学生和普通学校学生已占全北方人口总数的16％，比以前全印度支那学生总数增长了五倍。目前越南北方的大学生人数比1939年全印度支那大学生人数最多的一年还增加了十三倍。
    上述巨大的成就是由于以敬爱的胡志明主席为首的越南劳动党的正确领导，这些成就是和苏联、中国与其他兄弟的社会主义国家的无私帮助，以及世界工人运动和全世界的民族解放运动、和平民主运动的热情支持分不开的。
    当我们越南北方人民为自己在越南北方建设社会主义所取得的重大成就而欢欣鼓舞的时候，越南南方人民却生活在美吴集团法西斯的黑暗统治下。美帝国主义及其仆从、走狗正在把越南南方变成新型的殖民地和军事基地，企图利用越南南方作为发动新战争的跳板，破坏越南、东南亚和世界的和平。他们明目张胆地破坏日内瓦协议，直接建立、训练和装备越南南方军队，通过各个军事顾问团而操纵越南南方军队的指挥权。和平虽然已经恢复六年了，但是越南南方没有一天不听到枪声炮声，没有一天不发生流血事件。那是由美国将军和顾问直接指挥的越南南方吴庭艳军队屠杀越南人民的枪炮声，由于美吴集团在越南南方施行迫害、压榨、剥削政策以及贫穷化人民群众的政策，因此越南南方人民群众的生活非常困苦。越南南方工农业生产陷入停顿状态，失业者愈来愈增加，生活物价日益高涨。美帝国主义及其走狗的统治就是我们越南南方人民被迫忍受一切困苦和灾难的根源。因此，越南人民一致奋起坚决地为反对美帝国主义而斗争。因为反对美帝国主义就是保卫和平，争取和保卫民族的独立、主权，就是为人类的自由民主和进步而斗争。越南人民愿意和世界人民一起坚决地为反对美帝国主义侵略者而斗争。我们坚信胜利一定是属于越南人民的，越南的和平统一事业必定会实现。越南民主共和国政府始终不渝地严正履行日内瓦协议，坚持通过和平的方式为争取统一祖国而斗争。
    同志们，朋友们：
    我们越南人民的斗争是在非常有利的世界形势中进行的。以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的力量正在日益壮大并且日益压倒帝国主义的势力。民族解放运动正在日益蓬勃地发展，并且相继地在亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲的许多国家取得胜利。美帝国主义越来越孤立。世界和平力量正在压倒战争势力，维护和平和制止新的世界大战的可能性正在日益增长，但是越南人民六年来通过反对美帝国主义在越南南方所玩弄的阴谋和行动的斗争，使我们日益清楚地认识到，帝国主义还存在一天，就仍然存在着发生侵略战争的根源。目前，以美帝国主义为首的帝国主义集团正在继续制造冷战局面，使得国际局势又趋于紧张。但如果全世界人民提高警惕，加强团结斗争，就一定能够粉碎美帝国主义的战争阴谋。越南人民和越南民主共和国政府愿意对反对美帝国主义保卫印度支那、东南亚和世界和平的斗争事业作出自己的贡献。越南人民和越南民主共和国政府完全支持苏联的和平外交政策，支持苏联旨在缓和国际局势的一切倡议。以及苏联政府关于全面的彻底的裁减军备的建议。我们把进一步加强和苏联、中国以及其他兄弟的社会主义国家之间的团结看作是最重要的任务。越南人民坚决支持中国、朝鲜、日本人民以及世界各国人民的反美斗争，坚决支持亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲的民族解放运动。越南人民特别关心到各个邻国的情况，始终希望巩固和发展与这些国家之间的友谊。越南民主共和国政府和人民坚决支持在国家元首西哈努克亲王领导下的柬埔寨政府所执行的和平中立政策。越南人民热烈支持老挝人民为反对美帝国主义的干涉在老挝实现真正的和平中立政策而展开的正义斗争。
    同志们、朋友们：
    中国和越南是兄弟之邦，自古以来就有着密切的关系。在反对帝国主义侵略的艰苦斗争的岁月里，兄弟般的中国人民曾经尽心竭力地支持越南人民。中华人民共和国和苏联是首先承认越南民主共和国的国家，而且曾为促使日内瓦会议达到成功，从而在1954年恢复印度支那的和平作出了重大的贡献。自从和平恢复以来，兄弟般的中国人民的无私和珍贵的帮助，对越南人民改造和发展经济事业有着很重大的作用。借此机会，我谨代表越南人民和越南民主共和国政府向兄弟般的中国人民表示深切的感谢。越南人民对于六亿五千万的中国人民在以毛泽东主席为首的中国共产党的英明领导下，在过去几年中所取得的连续大跃进的成就，感到无比的高兴。这些伟大的成就，对加强以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的力量，为保卫世界和平作出了贡献。越南人民和越南民主共和国政府坚决支持提倡和平共处五项原则的中华人民共和国的和平友好的外交政策，支持中国的一切和平倡议，支持周恩来总理关于亚洲及太平洋沿岸各国签订一项互不侵犯的和平公约，并把这个地区变成为无核武器地区的主张。
    越南人民和越南民主共和国政府坚决支持兄弟般的中国人民反对美帝国主义侵略，解放中国领土台湾的斗争，坚决反对制造两个中国的阴谋，要求必须让中华人民共和国在联合国享有应有的地位。
    越南人民衷心地祝贺中国人民在由中国共产党所提出的总路线的光辉照耀下，将取得许多更加巨大的大跃进的成绩。
    我谨提议举杯：
    为越中两国人民牢不可破的团结友谊，
    为中华人民共和国主席刘少奇同志的健康，
    为以伟大的苏联为首的社会主义阵营各国牢不可破的团结一致，
    为世界各国的和平友谊，
    干杯！
