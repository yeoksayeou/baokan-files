    I Have Come Here for the Second Time
    Vietnam Nong Guozhen

Last spring I came here, to this garden-like splendid land, and saw your dragon-like, phoenix-like dance, and your silk-painting-like beautiful scenery. When I returned to my motherland, looking at the endless grass, mountains, and rivers, and the flourishing spring of a hundred flowers blooming, I couldn't help but miss the unforgettable Guilin. Today, I have come here again, and everything has been renewed. All the mountains and rivers are shining with dazzling brilliance. There is no night in life, only a dazzling daytime. Is this a city or a countryside? There are deafening machine sounds and hammering sounds, bustling shops, as well as schools, nurseries, and hospitals… On the flat roads, there are crowds of busy people, unable to hide the joy in their hearts. How much happiness has the People's Commune brought! All this is more perfect than a beautiful dream! We climbed the straight Duxiu Peak and looked out over the vast land and sky. The Li River is like a golden ribbon, and the overlapping peaks are like brocade painted screens. The peaks undulate under our feet, and the colorful clouds are like red flags brushing over the mountain peaks. This is truly a vivid color painting, truly a set of poems that can never be fully recited. We stood on the top of Crescent Moon Mountain, and before our eyes was a cluster of sparkling stars. Songs rose from the pavilions, and only then did we realize that those were countless electric lights! Coming here is like entering a fairyland, but this fairyland is not created by Buddhist magic. This is the result of the people's Great Leap Forward, a miraculous achievement led by the Chinese Communist Party. If I were a sculptor, I would definitely look for the most exquisite marble in the world. Even if I didn't have a chisel, I would carve with my fingernails, to make these extraordinary scenes last forever. Unfortunately, I am an ordinary person and can only use simple poems to praise – our great neighbor, who will forever be on the road of the Great Leap Forward! I am about to return to my motherland, back to the familiar mountains and rivers and the people. Why is my heart so excited and full of confidence? Because my motherland will also be as prosperous as you!

### 我第二次来到这里

    我第二次来到这里
    越南  农国振去年春天我来到这里，来到这花园一样灿烂的国土，看到你龙飞凤舞的身姿，看到你绸画般美丽的景色。当重新回到我的祖国时，望着那无尽的草木、山岭和江河，望着百花齐放的繁荣的春天，不由又怀念起难忘的桂林。今天，我又来到这里，一切都焕然一新，所有山峰、江河闪着夺目的光彩，生活里没有黑夜，只有绚烂的白天。这是城市还是农村呢？有震耳的机器声和锤声，有营业兴隆的商店，也有学校、托儿所和医院……平坦的公路上尽是繁忙的人群，掩不住胸中的欢欣；人民公社带来多少的幸福啊，这一切真比美梦还要完满！我们登上笔直的独秀峰，遥望那辽阔的土地和天空，漓江像一条金色的飘带，重叠的山峰像锦绣画屏。峰峦在脚下起伏，彩云像红旗拂过山巅，这真是一幅鲜艳的彩色画，这真是一组诵读不完的诗篇。我们伫立在月牙山顶，眼前是一片闪烁的群星，楼阁里歌声四起，才知道那是数不尽的电灯！来到这里真如进入仙境，这仙境却不是佛法点成，这是人民大跃进的结果，这是中国共产党领导的奇功。假如我是雕刻家，必定去寻找世上最精美的花石，即使没有凿刀就用指甲来刻，要让这些非凡的景物永存。可惜我是个平凡的人，只能用朴素的诗歌来赞扬——我们伟大的邻国，将永远在大跃进的道路上！我就要回到自己的祖国，回到熟悉的山川和人民身边，我的心为何这样激动而充满自信？因为我的祖国也会像你一样繁荣！
