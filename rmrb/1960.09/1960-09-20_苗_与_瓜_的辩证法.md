    The Dialectic of "Seedlings" and "Melons"
    Lù Ruìkūn, Worker at Shanghai Guangda Hosiery Factory

    There's a common saying: good seeds, good seedlings; good seedlings, good melons. In industrial production, some people quote this, believing that only good raw materials can produce good products. In our factory, some people say that it's impossible to use low-grade yarn to produce socks that are both smooth, elastic, and meet specifications.

    Is this correct? I think the saying "good seeds, good seedlings; good seedlings, good melons" is not wrong in itself, which is why the countryside has always valued cultivating fine seeds and strong seedlings. But we cannot conclude that good seedlings will necessarily yield good melons. Because from the growth of melon seedlings to the fruition of melons, it is still necessary to go through a series of arduous and meticulous field management tasks such as weeding, fertilizing, and preventing and controlling pests and diseases. Otherwise, even if the melon seedlings planted are very good, it is impossible to produce good melons. Growing melons is like this, and industrial production is also like this.

    For example, the sixty-count double-thread patterned socks produced in our factory in the past used a relatively high-grade raw material. It stands to reason that all the products should be of high quality, but unexpectedly, there were often quite a few defective products. What was the reason? After analysis and research, it was found that most of these defective products were caused by our one-sided understanding of high yield and high quality, our lack of strong political responsibility, and oil stains incurred during the production process. In this case, even though good raw materials were used, the products produced were not good.

    Of course, if the seedlings are not good, it will affect the production of good melons. However, if people strengthen field management, timely topdressing and weeding, etc., they can still produce good melons. Is industrial production not the same? For example, a battery factory had low product quality in the past. Later, after inspection, it was found that this was due to the fact that some staff members one-sidedly emphasized the poor quality of raw materials and relaxed their subjective efforts. Therefore, they summed up their experiences and lessons, fully mobilized the masses, established the idea that high output must be of high quality, and adopted methods such as "elaborate processing of coarse grains," strengthening management, and improving formulas. After a short period of effort, the raw materials used were the same as before, but the product quality was greatly improved.

    Why is it that sometimes good raw materials produce defective products, while inferior raw materials produce high-quality products? Chairman Mao taught us in his article "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People": "Under certain conditions, bad things can lead to good results, and good things can also lead to bad results." In "On Contradiction," Chairman Mao talked about the mutual transformation of the contradictory aspects of things, saying: "...the two contradictory aspects within a thing, because of certain conditions, each transform in the direction opposite to itself, and transform to the position occupied by its opposite side." The certain conditions referred to here are the important key to promoting the transformation of contradictions. What are the conditions for inferior raw materials to produce high-quality products? I think this condition is people's mental state and subjective efforts. Good raw material quality is certainly a favorable condition, but some people think that as long as the seedlings are good, the melons must be good, and they relax their "cultivation" work of the "melon seedlings" ideologically. Then the management system loosens, the work responsibility weakens, and the quality inspection is not grasped either. When one thing loosens, everything loosens, so the quality declines, and good raw materials become defective products. On the contrary, if politics is in command and a comprehensive view of more, faster, better, and more economical is established, even if the raw materials are poor, he can carefully find various reasons affecting quality, understand the causes and consequences of past defective products, and humbly learn, striving to master the laws of using inferior raw materials to produce high-quality products. In this way, not only can the influence of unfavorable conditions be restricted in a down-to-earth and meticulous manner, but also the unfavorable conditions can be used as the driving force to improve product quality. Even if it is not a "good seedling," through subjective efforts, it can promote the transformation of contradictions, so that "weak seedlings" can bear "good melons."

### “苗”与“瓜”的辩证法

    “苗”与“瓜”的辩证法	上海光大袜厂工人　陆瑞坤
    俗话说，种好苗好，苗好瓜好。在工业生产中，有人引用这句话，认为只有好原料，才有好产品。在我们厂里，就有人说，要用低级纱来生产既光洁、松紧又合乎规格的袜子是办不到的。
    这话对不对呢？我认为“种好苗好、苗好瓜好”这句话本身并没有错，所以农村中一直重视培育良种壮苗。但也不能得出好苗一定结好瓜的结论。因为从瓜苗成长到结瓜，还需要经过锄草、施肥、防治病虫害等一系列繁重而细致的田间管理工作，否则，尽管栽下去的瓜苗很好，也不可能结出好瓜来。种瓜是这样，工业生产也是这样。
    比如，我们厂里过去生产的六十支双线花袜，用的都是一种比较高级的原料，照理说生产出来的应该都是优质品了，但出人意料，有时次货却不少。原因何在呢？经过分析研究，发现这些次货所以产生，绝大部分都是由于我们对高产优质的认识片面，政治责任心不强，在生产过程中沾染了油渍造成的。在这种情况下，尽管用的是好原料，生产出来的却不是好产品。
    当然，如果苗不好，对结好瓜是有影响的，但是，人们如果加强田间管理，及时追肥除草，等等，还是能够结出好瓜来的。工业生产何尝不是如此？比如，有家电池厂，过去产品质量不高，后来经过检查，发现这是由于部分工作人员片面强调原材料质量不好，而放松了主观努力的结果。于是他们总结了经验教训，充分发动群众，树立高产必须优质的思想，采取“粗粮细作”、加强管理、改进配方等方法，经过短期努力，用的原料和过去一样，产品质量却大大提高了。
    为什么有时候好原料出了次货，而用较差的原料反而出了优质品呢？毛主席在《关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题》一文中教导我们：“在一定的条件下，坏的东西可以引出好的结果，好的东西也可以引出坏的结果。”毛主席在《矛盾论》中谈到矛盾着的事物的互相转化问题时说过：“……事物内部矛盾着的两方面，因为一定的条件而各向着和自己相反的方面转化了去，向着它的对立方面所处的地位转化了去。”这里指的一定条件，就是促使矛盾转化的重要关键。较差的原料能生产优质品，它的条件又是什么呢？我看这个条件就是人们的精神状态和主观努力。原材料质量好，这当然是一个有利条件，但有人认为，只要苗好必定瓜好，思想上就放松了对“瓜苗”的“培养”工作，接着管理制度松了，工作责任心差了，质量检验也不抓了，一松百松，于是质量下降，好原料变成了次货。相反，如果政治挂了帅，树立了多快好省的全面观点，即使原材料较差，他也能够细心寻找影响质量的各种原因，摸清过去造成副次品的来龙去脉，虚心学习，力求掌握用较差的原料生产优质品的规律。这样，既踏实细致地限制不利条件的影响，又把不利条件作为提高产品质量的动力，即使不是“好苗”，经过主观努力，也能促进矛盾的转化，使“弱苗”能结出“好瓜”来。
