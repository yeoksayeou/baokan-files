　　Taking Imperialist Money and Undermining International Socialist Unity
　　The Tito Group Serves its American Masters
    Cuban "Hoy" Comments on Tito's Participation in the UN General Assembly
    Xinhua News Agency, Havana, 20th September. The Cuban newspaper "Hoy" published a commentary on 18th September regarding Tito's participation in the United Nations General Assembly, exposing the ugly face of the Tito modern revisionist group serving its American masters.
    The commentary stated, "Tito is a friend of the Americans, which Tito himself often declares, and Eisenhower always claims whenever he has the opportunity."
    The commentary said, "Imperialism has used millions of dollars for its own purposes, generously giving this money to Yugoslavia." The commentary pointed out that Tito and Eisenhower "boasted about the fact that this infamous revisionist of socialist scientific theory received more than three billion dollars," while the money Tito received was six times the five hundred million dollars in "aid" recently promised by the United States to Latin American countries. The commentary said, "To understand what is really happening in this Balkan country, it is enough to think about this point."
    The commentary condemned the Tito group for "undermining the unity of international socialism." It said, "Therefore, Tito is favored by the State Department. The State Department prompted it to form an alliance with Turkey, while Turkey also has an alliance with the United States, so Yugoslavia is indirectly linked to the aggressive North Atlantic Treaty Organization."

　　拿帝国主义的钱　破坏国际社会主义团结
　  铁托集团为美国主子效劳
    古巴“今日报”评铁托参加联合国大会
    新华社哈瓦那20日电　古巴“今日报”18日就铁托参加联合国大会这件事发表评论，揭露铁托现代修正主义集团为它的美国主子效劳的丑恶嘴脸。
    评论说，“铁托是美国人的朋友，这是铁托自己经常宣称的，艾森豪威尔每当有机会时也总是这样声称的。”
    评论说，“帝国主义为了自己的目的使用了千百万美元，把这笔钱大方地交给南斯拉夫。”评论指出，铁托和艾森豪威尔“为这个臭名远扬的关于社会主义科学理论的修正主义者得到三十多亿美元这一点而大肆吹嘘”，而铁托得到的这笔钱是美国最近允诺给予拉丁美洲国家的五亿美元“援助”的六倍。评论说，“要了解这个巴尔干国家究竟发生了什么事，只要想一想这点就够了。”
    评论谴责铁托集团“破坏国际社会主义的团结”。它说，“因此，铁托得到国务院的垂青。国务院促使它同土耳其订立联盟，而土耳其同时又同美国有联盟关系，这样南斯拉夫就间接地同侵略性的北大西洋公约组织联系在一起。”
