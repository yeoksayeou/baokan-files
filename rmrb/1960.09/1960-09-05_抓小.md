    "Grasp the Small"
    Chen Jianwu
    In leadership work, "grasping the small" is a very important issue. In industry, we must grasp the work teams; in agriculture, we must grasp the small teams; and on other fronts, even if there isn't a "small" in name, there is a "small" in substance. This "small" refers to the grassroots level of work, the front lines of production. Though the sparrow is small, it has all the vital organs. Chairman Mao taught us that leadership work should learn to "catch sparrows." "Grasping the small" is the way to catch sparrows.
      "Grasping the small" is opposed to bureaucratism and also to generalized leadership methods. In "small" places, the work is very specific, everything is real, and you can't get away with just giving orders; you're forced to be practical. Take a production team, for example. If you want them to have a Great Leap Forward and harvest more grain, they will calculate with you, saying how many mu of land this team has, how many laborers, how many mu each laborer cultivates, and how much grain each mu can yield. They will present you with a pile of problems, and you have to think about them and help them solve them properly. The same goes for production teams in factories. If you're careless, even if people don't protest, the machines will "protest": "No, comrade, a part of me is broken, and I can't leap forward." At this time, you have to help solve the problem of this part. In this sense, the small becomes large. "Grasping the small" is actually "grasping the large." If you don't grasp the "small" well, and don't make a big deal of the "small" character, it will hinder the sustained leap forward of the socialist construction cause. Now the Party Central Committee is calling on the entire Party and the entire people to vigorously develop agriculture and grain production. How to "vigorously develop" it? Judging from the situation in various places, there are many ways, but one thing is common: they are all grasping the production teams. It seems that the more you want to do something big, the more you have to "grasp the small." This is the unity of opposites; the large is the concentration of the small, composed of the small.
    The sustained leap forward in agricultural production relies on the people's communes, relying on the superiority of the people's communes' "large size and high degree of public ownership." However, when the people's communes engage in agricultural production, they still rely on the small teams. If the small teams are not strong in combat effectiveness, it is impossible to do a good job in production. Therefore, in the movement to vigorously develop agriculture and grain production, all localities are comprehensively arming the small teams, so that the small teams have sufficient labor, fine agricultural tools, and strong leadership. This is indeed grasping the key. Otherwise, if you shout "vigorously develop" for a long time, but the combat effectiveness of the small teams is still weak, it is actually still "developing in a small way." For example, strengthening the front line, where is the real front line? Naturally, it is in the small teams and groups. If the small teams and groups increase labor, it means that the front line has added labor. Otherwise, if some labor is transferred from other fronts to the agricultural front, but it is stuck in the commune or management area, and not to the small team, it cannot be said that the agricultural front line has increased how much labor. Similarly, when leading cadres go deep into work, just walking around and standing in the commune or management area, although it is better than sitting in the office, it cannot be regarded as going deep into the front line.
    It can be seen that advocating "grasping the small" is not a small problem, but a big problem. It shows that our work is more in-depth, the leadership style has been greatly improved, grasping both deeply and meticulously, and carrying forward the Party's glorious tradition of hard struggle. The problem is very obvious: to "grasp the small" and solve the problems in the "small," you have to go deep down, work hard, eat, live, work, and consult with the masses. In this way, it is incompatible with those styles of looking up, being crude and not meticulous, floating and not deep, and being flashy and not practical. Of course, this is not to say that once you talk about "grasping the small" and go to the small team or group, all problems will be solved. No. Advocating "grasping the small" also requires being good at "grasping the small" and raising it to the "large." But first of all, recognize the importance of "grasping the small" ideologically, and then add the spirit of hard work, go deep down, and grasp it practically, then it may be grasped well, and it will be conducive to doing a good job in big undertakings.

### “抓小”

    “抓小”
    陈健吾
    在领导工作中，“抓小”是个很重要的问题。工业中要抓小组，农业中要抓小队，其他战线上即使没有一个名义上的小，实质上也有一个“小”字。这里的“小”，也就是工作中的基层，生产的前线。麻雀虽小，肝胆俱全。毛主席教导我们，领导工作要学会“抓麻雀”。“抓小”就是抓麻雀的办法。
      “抓小”与官僚主义是对立的，与一般化的领导方法也是对立的。在“小”的地方，工作十分具体，什么都是真刀真枪，你在那里指手划脚一定吃不开，非逼迫你讲实际不可。以一个生产小队来说，你要他大跃进，多收一些粮食，他就要和你算算账，说是他这个小队有几亩地，几个劳动力，一个劳力种几亩，每亩能打多少粮，问题一堆给你摆出来，你就得想一想，好好帮助他解决解决。工厂里的生产小组就更不用说了，你马虎一下，人不抗议，机器也要“抗议”：“不行呵，同志，我有一个零件坏了，不能跃进了。”这时，你就得帮助解决这个零件的问题。从这个意义上说，小倒变成大了。“抓小”，其实是“抓大。不好好地抓“小”，不在“小”字上面大作文章，就要妨碍社会主义建设事业的持续跃进。现在党中央号召全党全民大办农业、大办粮食，怎么“大办”法呢？从各地情况来看，办法是非常之多，但有共同的一条，都在抓生产小队。似乎越要大办，就越要“抓小”。这是对立的统一，大是小的集中，是由小组成的。
    农业生产持续跃进依靠人民公社，依靠人民公社“一大二公”的优越性。可是，人民公社搞农业生产，还是依靠小队，小队战斗力不强，搞好生产就不可能。所以，在大办农业、大办粮食运动中，各地都在全面武装小队，使小队有充足的劳力，精良的农具，坚强的领导。这确是抓到了要害。不然的话，如果你喊了半天“大办”，小队的战斗力还是很弱的，其实还是“小办”。譬如加强第一线吧，真正的第一线在哪里呢？自然是在小队、小组。小队、小组增加了劳力，就是第一线增添了劳力。否则，从其他战线调整一些劳力到农业战线上，如果卡到公社、管理区，而不是到小队，就不能说农业第一线增加了多少劳力。同样地，领导干部深入工作，只是到公社、管理区走一走、站一站，虽然比坐在机关好，但也不能算是深入第一线的。
    可见，提倡“抓小”不是很小的问题，倒是很大的问题。它表明我们的工作更加深入，领导作风有了极大改进，既抓得深又抓得细，发扬了党的艰苦奋斗的光荣传统。问题很明显，要“抓小”，解决“小”中的问题，就得深入下去，埋头苦干一番，与群众同吃、同住、同劳动、同商量。这样，就跟那些眼睛朝上、粗而不细、浮而不深、华而不实的作风格格不入。当然，这不是说，一讲“抓小”，到了小队或小组里去，就什么问题都解决了。不是的。提倡“抓小”，还得善于“抓小”，提高到“大”。但是首先从思想上认识“抓小”的重要性，再加上埋头苦干的精神，深入下去，切切实实地抓它，那就可能抓好，而有利于办好大事业。
