Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, September 11th: To bid farewell to the Japanese theatrical delegation visiting China for performances, over 500 people from various circles in Tokyo held a farewell gathering on the evening of the 10th.

The farewell party was jointly organized by the Japan-China Cultural Exchange Association, the Japan Theater Association, and the Japan Theatrical Actors Association. Among those attending the farewell party were prominent figures from political, academic, literary, artistic, theatrical, and film circles, including Nosaka Sanzo, Kazami Akira, Kata San Tetsu, Toki Zemmaro, Hasegawa Tetsuzo, Aono Suekichi, Noma Hiroshi, Kamei Katsuichiro, and Akita Ujaku.

Nakajima Kenzo and Kubota Mantaro spoke on behalf of the organizing groups, wishing the Japanese theatrical delegation success in their visit and performances in China.

Nakajima said that it is very meaningful for the Japanese theatrical troupes to unite for their first visit and performance in China. China's invitation to the Japanese theatrical delegation to visit China signifies the Chinese people's high regard for the Japanese people's anti-American patriotic struggle. Nakajima expressed his hope that this visit and performance would play a significant role in enhancing the friendship between the peoples of Japan and China.

Murayama Tomoyoshi, the head of the visiting theatrical delegation, said at the meeting, "We must not fail the expectations of the Chinese audience in terms of performance, and at the same time, we must learn the advantages of Chinese drama to promote the progress of Japanese drama."

The Japanese theatrical delegation will fly to China on the morning of the 12th.
