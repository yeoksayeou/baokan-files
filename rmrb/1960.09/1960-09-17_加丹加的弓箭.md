    Katanga's Bows and Arrows Shi Ning
    Airplanes, bombs, machine guns, and bows and arrows, knives – which has more power? Let's look at this news:
    According to Agence France-Presse, in the northern part of Katanga in the Congo, the people rose up and drove away the "administrators" and colonialists sent there by the traitorous Tshombe group who had sided with imperialism. Before this, the people there had ambushed the reactionary police forces with bows and arrows and knives. Although the reactionary group dispatched airplanes, strafed the people with machine guns, and dropped incendiary bombs to burn villages, the local people continued to bravely strike at the reactionary police equipped with machine guns using primitive weapons, killing eight reactionary policemen and two Belgian officers. (See the People's Daily, September 10)
    The imperialists especially value Katanga, and try every possible means to use the traitorous Tshombe group of the Congo to split the Congo. When they cannot control the entire Congo, they still want to hold on to Katanga. In their eyes, Katanga is not part of the sacred territory of the Congolese people, but the most important strategic raw material base needed for their evil wars of aggression against the world (Katanga's uranium production accounts for 60% of the uranium production of the entire capitalist world, and its cobalt production accounts for 75%). The imperialists want to use nuclear weapons to intimidate the people of the world. And it is precisely in this place they want to permanently seize as a raw material base for nuclear weapons that the heroic Congolese people do not take all kinds of new weapons seriously at all. – What is there to fear when fighting for one's sacred rights on one's own sacred land!
    As long as justice is on the side of bows and arrows, and injustice is on the side of airplanes and bombs, bows and arrows are stronger than airplanes and bombs.
    "Weapons are an important factor in war, but not the decisive factor; it is people, not things, that are decisive. The comparison of strength is not only a comparison of military and economic power, but also a comparison of manpower and popular support." (Selected Works of Mao Zedong, p. 459) This is the argument made by Comrade Mao Zedong in "On Protracted War" in May 1938. More than twenty years have passed, and from the victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan to the present, the victory of people's liberation struggles and national liberation struggles time and time again throughout the world has proved that this argument is an irrefutable truth, and has also made this argument even more brilliant.
    The bows and arrows of Katanga cannot but remind people of our country's red-tasseled spears. Red-tasseled spears and other relatively primitive weapons, starting from one hundred and nineteen years ago, in May 1841 in the northwest of Guangzhou, under the banner of the Pingying Regiment, once greatly defeated the invading army led by the British Elliott; to exactly one hundred years ago, in the summer of 1860 in the suburbs of Shanghai, under the banner of the Taiping Army, once greatly defeated the foreign gun team led by the American Ward; until the land revolution and the War of Resistance Against Japan, always stood with awe-inspiring might in the face of the enemy's airplanes, warships, artillery, and machine guns. Who is progressing, and who is regressing! Who is civilized, and who is barbaric? If we only look at weapons, we would be greatly mistaken. The bows and arrows of Katanga, in the capacity of progressive, civilized, and righteous defenders, will be recorded in history like the red-tasseled spears and other relatively primitive weapons once used by our people.
    On September 10, our distinguished guest, the head of state of the first African country to visit our country, Sékou Touré, said the following in his speech at our state banquet:
    "If, in the past, cannons and bombs could intimidate people to force them to accept the shackles of colonialism, then today, cannons and bombs cannot stop the people from continuing their struggle, because they are now inspired by a factor more powerful than any bomb, and that is their recognition of their humiliating position and their will to restore dignity in freedom."
    Such words are inspiring and admirable.
    Being in a humiliating position, being aware of this and not being reconciled to it; having the will to restore dignity, and having the belief in final victory, people must rise up to make revolution. Even if empty-handed, they must fight the enemy to the end; even with only a kitchen knife, they must make a big revolution. This is "more powerful than any bomb." The weapons in the hands of the people can also be changed. From mastering relatively primitive weapons, they can gradually master modern weapons. This is without a doubt.
    The young Republic of the Congo is now in a serious crisis. American imperialism is running rampant there under the banner of the United Nations, doing bad things, and plotting to subvert the legitimate government of the Congo, and to salvage the defeat of imperialism and colonialism in the Congo and the entire Africa. The Congolese people still face many difficulties, but the masses of the people are the creators of history – is there anyone who still does not believe this? If the situation in Asia, Africa, and Latin America today is not enough to make them sober, Asia, Africa, and Latin America tomorrow will surely make them open their eyes wide. (Attached picture)

### 加丹加的弓箭

    加丹加的弓箭	史凝
    飞机、炸弹、机关枪和弓箭、刀子，哪个更有力量？可以看看这个消息：
    据法新社报道，在刚果的加丹加北部地区，人民起来把投靠帝国主义的冲伯集团派在那里的“行政官”和殖民者一起赶走了。在这以前，那里的人民还曾用弓箭和刀子伏击了反动警察部队。尽管反动集团出动了飞机，用机枪扫射人民，投掷燃烧弹焚烧村庄，当地人民继续用原始武器英勇打击配备有机枪的反动警察，打死反动警察八人、比籍军官两名。（见9月10日《人民日报》）
    帝国主义者特别看重加丹加，千方百计利用刚果的叛国的冲伯集团分裂刚果，在无法控制整个刚果的时候还要抓住加丹加不放。在他们的眼睛里，加丹加不是刚果人的神圣的国土的一部分，而是他们准备侵略全世界的罪恶战争所需要的最重要的一个战略原料基地（加丹加的铀产量占整个资本主义世界铀产量的60％，钴产量占75％）。帝国主义者要想用核武器恐吓世界人民。而正是在这个他们想永远霸占起来作为核武器原料基地的地方，英勇的刚果人民根本不把一切新式武器放在眼里。——在自己的神圣的国土上为自己的神圣的权利而战，何惧之有！
    只要正义在弓箭方面，而不义在飞机、炸弹方面，弓箭就比飞机、炸弹更强。
    “武器是战争的重要的因素，但不是决定的因素，决定的因素是人不是物。力量对比不但是军力和经济力的对比，而且是人力和人心的对比。”（《毛泽东选集》第459页）这是1938年5月毛泽东同志在《论持久战》中所作的论断。二十多年过去了，从抗日战争的胜利到现在，整个地球上一次又一次人民解放斗争和民族解放斗争的胜利，都证明这个论断是颠扑不破的真理，也都使这个论断更增光辉。
    加丹加的弓箭，使人们不由得联想到我国的红缨枪（梭标）。红缨枪以及其他比较原始的武器，从一百一十九年前，1841年5月在广州城西北，在平英团的旗帜下曾经大败英国人义律率领的侵略军；到整整一百年前，1860年夏天在上海郊外，在太平军的旗帜下曾经大败美国人华尔率领的洋枪队；直到土地革命、抗日战争，在敌人的飞机、军舰、大炮、机关枪面前，总是威风凛凛。究竟谁是进步，谁是后退！谁是文明，谁是野蛮，如果只从武器看，那就大错而特错了。加丹加的弓箭，将以进步、文明、正义的保卫者的身份，和我国人民曾经使用过的红缨枪以及其他比较原始的武器一样，载入史册。
    9月10日，我们的贵宾、来我国访问的第一个非洲国家的元首塞古·杜尔在我们的国宴上讲的话里有这样一段：
    “如果说，在过去，大炮和炸弹还能威吓人民来迫使他们接受殖民主义的枷锁，那么，在今天，大炮和炸弹都不能阻止人民继续进行斗争，因为他们现在受到比任何炸弹都强有力的因素的鼓舞，那就是他们认识到自己所处的屈辱地位和在自由中恢复尊严的意志。”
    这样的话令人鼓舞，也令人钦佩。
    处于屈辱地位，自觉到这一点而且不甘心这一点；有恢复尊严的意志，有最后胜利的信念，人们就一定要起来革命。即使赤手空拳，也要和敌人斗争到底；只有一把菜刀，也要大闹革命。这“比任何炸弹都强有力”。人民群众手里拿到的武器，也是可以变化的。从掌握比较原始的武器，可以到逐步掌握现代化武器。这是毫无疑问的。
    年轻的刚果共和国现在正处在严重的危机中。美帝国主义打着联合国的旗号正在那里横行霸道，干着坏事，阴谋颠复刚果的合法政府，挽回帝国主义、殖民主义在刚果和整个非洲的败局。刚果人民面前还有许多艰难，但是人民群众是历史的创造者——有谁至今还不相信这一点吗？今日的亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲的局势如果还不足以使他们清醒，明日的亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲就一定会使他们睁大眼睛。（附图片）
