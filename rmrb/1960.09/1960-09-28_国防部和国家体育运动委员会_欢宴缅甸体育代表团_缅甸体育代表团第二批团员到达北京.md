Xinhua News Agency, September 27th: The Ministry of National Defense and the State Physical Culture and Sports Commission of the People's Republic of China held a banquet this evening to welcome Lieutenant Colonel Maw Win, head of the Burmese Sports Delegation, and all members of the delegation.

General Xiao Hua, Deputy Director of the General Political Department of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, and Li Da, Vice Chairman of the State Physical Culture and Sports Commission, warmly welcomed the distinguished guests on behalf of the Ministry of National Defense and the State Physical Culture and Sports Commission.

In his speech at the banquet, General Xiao Hua said that on the eve of celebrating the 11th anniversary of the founding of our country, we are very happy and pleased that the Burmese Sports Delegation, along with the esteemed Prime Minister U Nu and General Ne Win of your country, can come to our country for a friendly visit. On behalf of the Ministry of National Defense and the Sports Commission of the People's Republic of China, I extend a warm welcome and friendly greetings to you.

General Xiao Hua said that the good-neighborly and friendly relations between China and Burma, through the unremitting efforts of the Chinese and Burmese governments, and under the guidance of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, have finally realized the common desire of the Chinese and Burmese peoples for friendship: Our two governments are about to sign a treaty of peace and friendship on the boundary. The signing of the boundary treaty between our two countries marks a new stage in the friendly relations between China and Burma.

General Xiao Hua said that both of our countries were Asian countries that suffered greatly from imperialist oppression in the past, especially since we have a "Paukphaw" relationship as close as siblings. Therefore, since our two countries got rid of imperialist oppression and achieved independence, our friendly relations have been developing day by day on a new basis. Your visit to China will undoubtedly make due contributions to the further development and consolidation of the friendship between the peoples and athletes of China and Burma.

Lieutenant Colonel Maw Win, head of the Burmese Sports Delegation, gave an enthusiastic speech at the banquet. He said, although this is our first visit to your country, I believe that our friendly exchanges will continue frequently in the future. During the friendly visit, our friendship will grow day by day.

Lieutenant Colonel Maw Win said that since our two countries gained independence and liberation from imperialist oppression, we can gather here today, which is an iron proof of our two countries' opposition to imperialism.

Lieutenant Colonel Maw Win said that our visit is not just a verbal visit, we can create and enhance the friendship between the peoples of the two countries in mutual visits. Today we have seen China's great construction, and we believe that in a few years, China's construction will be even more magnificent.

Lieutenant Colonel Maw Win finally proposed: A toast to the everlasting friendship between China and Burma.

Among those present at the banquet tonight were: Chinese People's Liberation Army generals Lieutenant General Xiao Xiangrong, Lieutenant General Wang Huiqiu of the Air Force, Rear Admiral Zhang Xuesi, Rear Admiral Liu Yi, Major General Li Xin, as well as Senior Colonel Bai Wenhua, Senior Colonel Li Wei, Senior Colonel Ye Xiuzhi, and representatives of athletes from the Army, Navy, and Air Force.
