Under the Manipulation of US Imperialism
Security Council Postpones Debate on the Congo Issue

Xinhua News Agency, New York, 13th: The United Nations Security Council continued its meeting on the 12th to discuss the situation in the Congo. The meeting adjourned after fifteen minutes based on a proposal by the US representative.

US representative Wadsworth, citing the "chaotic" situation in the Congo, suggested that the Security Council "indefinitely postpone" the debate on the Congo issue and requested that the President of the Security Council convene another meeting when the so-called "situation becomes clearer."

Soviet representative Zorin opposed the US suggestion to postpone the debate. Wadsworth obstructed debate on the Soviet opinion.

Subsequently, the President of the Security Council, Italian representative Ortona, requested a vote on the US proposal. The proposal passed with nine votes in favor and two against, with the Soviet and Polish representatives voting against.

The US suggestion to postpone is in the hope that changes favorable to imperialism will occur in the Congo situation.

    在美帝国主义的操纵下
    安理会延期辩论刚果问题
    据新华社13日讯　纽约消息：联合国安全理事会12日继续举行会议讨论刚果局势，会议举行十五分钟以后即根据美国代表的建议休会。
    美国代表华兹渥斯以刚果局势“混乱不堪”为理由，建议安理会“无限期地延期”辩论刚果问题，并且要求安理会主席在所谓“局势较为明朗”时再召开一次会议。
    苏联代表佐林反对美国关于延期辩论的建议。华兹渥斯阻挠就苏联的意见进行辩论。
    接着，安理会主席、意大利代表奥托纳即要求对美国的建议进行表决。这项建议以九票对两票获得通过，苏联和波兰代表投票反对。
    美国建议延期是希望刚果局势会发生有利于帝国主义的变化。
