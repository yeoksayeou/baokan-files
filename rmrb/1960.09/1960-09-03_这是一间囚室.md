    This is a Prison Cell
    Fang Zhimin, Martyr's posthumous work

    This prison cell has walls lined with white paper. Although the paper is old and has turned a dull yellow, and there are black stains and patches of soil where it leaks, the room still looks quite white when sunlight shines in or when the bright electric lights are on. Two glass windows face the sky, providing decent light and air. Facing the windows, against the wall, stands a black lacquered rectangular desk, upon which are placed several thick books and an inkstone and teacup. Beside the desk is a short bamboo chair with shortened legs. Behind the chair is an iron bed, covered with a gray military blanket, with a neatly folded coarse cloth quilt arranged in three layers along the inner edge of the bed. In the inner corner of the room sits an unpainted, uncovered white wooden box, inside which hides a chamber pot, its mouth open day and night, receiving the filth excreted daily by the prisoner in this room. In front of the white wooden box, against the wall, sits a blue porcelain spittoon, competing with the chamber pot as it opens its mouth day and night to receive the prisoner's phlegm, snot, orange peels, sugarcane dregs, and paper scraps. Upon suddenly entering this room, if one did not see the glaringly unsightly white wooden box, or the prisoner, Xiangsong, sitting at the desk, wearing iron shackles and clearly identifiable as a prisoner, one might think this was not a prison cell but a study.

    Indeed, even Xiangsong, confined in this room, thought it was better than the school dormitory room he had lived in ten years ago in the provincial capital.

    This is a room in the detention center's privileged ward. The detention center is divided into two sections: the privileged ward and the general ward. The privileged ward is for those who have political status or wealth. They have committed various crimes for various reasons and must be punished by law, but their daily lives and bodies cannot endure the same treatment as those in the general ward. Confining them to the general ward would likely cause them to fall ill or even die within a day or two, which is absolutely unacceptable. Therefore, a privileged ward is specially set aside for them, mainly in the hope that they will repent as soon as possible. So, rather than calling the privileged ward a prison, it might be more accurate to call it a sanatorium, except that one cannot freely enter or leave. Compared to the damp general ward, it is vastly different. Prisoners suffering in the general ward, upon suddenly seeing the clean and spacious privileged ward, cannot help but feel that one is heaven and the other is hell.

    Because Xiangsong is an important political prisoner, the authorities moved him from the general ward to the privileged ward in order to quickly change his original ideology.

    Previously in the general ward, Xiangsong had three companions with whom he lived, and chatting made the days pass easily. Now he is alone, sitting in this prison cell all day, and he feels deeply lonely. He doesn't smoke or drink, so he cannot use cigarettes to dispel boredom or alcohol to relieve sorrow. The only thing that can make him forget everything is reading. He borrowed many books from his fellow inmates in the general ward. He has always loved to read, and when he has enough books to read, he doesn't even feel the ten-pound iron shackles on his feet are so heavy, especially now. Books are like morphine injections from a doctor's hand, numbing and forgetting his mental worries and physical pain when he reads them and finds them interesting.

    Eventually, his mental capacity is limited. After reading for several hours, his head starts to throb. He puts his elbows on the desk, holds his throbbing head in his hands, and continues to read, clenching his teeth and saying to himself, "Hurt as much as you want! Hurt! Hurt more! Let my brain hemorrhage and faint!" Only when the headache becomes too severe to bear does he put down the book and stand up by the desk. He either collapses onto the iron bed, stretches out his limbs, closes his eyes to rest, or paces back and forth in the room, or stands by the window, staring blankly at the small patch of gloomy rainy sky outside. He also glances at the willow tree outside the wall, half with withered branches and half with green leaves. When he sees that cluster of lush green willow leaves, he imagines that the trees all over the earth are probably growing vibrant green leaves in the warm spring breeze—from this, he seems to get a little bit of the feeling of spring.

    He lives his life the same way every day.

    Today, when the guard on shift change opens the door to check on him—handing over the most important prisoner—he sees that Xiangsong is not reading or pacing. He is sitting at the desk, supporting his head with his left hand, holding a pen in his right hand, writing and thinking on the paper. Xiangsong seems to have some feelings he wants to write down. What is he writing? Ah! He is writing a letter to his friends. Dear friends:

    I have finally been captured and imprisoned.

    You can see the circumstances of my capture and imprisonment in the newspapers, and you know the general idea, so I don't need to say more. After I was captured, I was bound with ropes, fitted with heavy shackles, photographed countless times, escorted in an armored car, paraded at several mass rallies, and locked in a cage. All of these things passed like a movie, scene by scene. I never want to recall those past events. Recollection can only increase my suffering! I don't want to tell you about my life in prison. Friends, whoever enters prison must feel sorrow and humiliation. I, of course, feel even more so, so I cannot tell you any good news. What I want to tell you today is another more important question, that is, about my love for China and saving China. You might be happy to hear me talk about this issue.

    Since I was imprisoned, many people have come to see me. Why do they come to see me? Probably with the curiosity of seeing a novel animal in a zoo! I cannot know how they comment on me behind my back, and I don't necessarily need to know. Based on what they said to me directly, they all acknowledge that I am a revolutionary. However, they think that I only care about the interests of the working class and peasants, and I ignore the interests of the nation, as if I am not someone who passionately loves China and loves the nation. Friends, is this true? Do the interests of the working class and peasants conflict with the interests of the nation? No, absolutely not. Those who truly seek the liberation of the working class and peasants are precisely those who seek the liberation of the nation. To not love China, to not love the nation, is simply a great injustice to my life.

    Friends, is my speech too verbose and annoying? Okay, I will only say the following sentences. I honestly tell you that my love for China is as sincere and unfeigned as it was in elementary school, and my heart to overthrow imperialism and seek the liberation of the Chinese nation is as fiery as ever. However, now I am a prisoner awaiting trial, and I have no opportunity to do my best for the Chinese nation. I am writing this letter today because I am moved by national enthusiasm, using words to make a cry for China in distress.

    Ah! Although I cannot actually fight for China, fight for the Chinese nation, my determination is always to pray day and night for the early success of the Chinese nation being liberated from the shackles of imperialism. If I can still survive, then I will shout for China every day that I live. If I cannot survive—if I die, in the place where I bleed, or in the place where I am buried, perhaps a lovely flower will grow. You should regard this flower as the embodiment of my sincerity! In the breeze, if that flower nods up and down, then it can be regarded as me paying sincere respect to the patriotic men of lofty ideals who are fighting for the liberation of the Chinese nation! If that flower sways left and right, then it can be regarded as me singing revolutionary songs, encouraging the soldiers to advance!

    Dear friends, do not be pessimistic, do not be discouraged, fight, and fight persistently and arduously! Provide all your wisdom and talents to the salvation of the nation! No matter what, we must never let the great and lovable China be destroyed by the dirty hands of imperialism!

    Your sincere Xiangsong
            Written in the prison cell on May 2nd.

    The prisoner Xiangsong finished writing the above letter, and carefully revised it from beginning to end once more. Believing that there were no major problems, he folded it and put it in a large envelope, on which he wrote: "To the unknown friends for your kind attention." He knew that this letter could not be mailed. He opened the drawer of the desk, put the letter inside, then dragged his feet with the shackles, clanging and clanging, to his iron bed and collapsed to sleep.

    His sleep in the past always had many nightmares. Perhaps he can sleep peacefully tonight! We hope that he can sleep peacefully, not have any dreams, or have a good dream.

    这是一间囚室
    方志敏  烈士遗作
    这间囚室，四壁都是用白纸裱糊过，虽过时已久，裱纸变了黯黄色，有几处漏雨的地方，并起了土块的黑色斑点；但有日光照射进来，或是强光的电灯亮了，这室内却还显得洁白。对天空开了两道玻璃窗，光线空气都不算坏。对准窗子，在室中靠面壁，放着一张黑漆色长方书桌，桌上摆了几本厚书和墨盒茶盅。桌边放着一把锯短了脚的矮竹椅，挨着竹椅背后，就是一张铁床，床上铺着灰色军毯，一床粗布棉被，折叠了三层，整齐的摆在床的里沿。在这室的里面一角，有一只未漆未盖的白木箱摆着，木箱里，另有一只马桶躲藏在里面，日夜张开着口，承受这室内囚人每日排泄下来的秽物。在白木箱前面的靠壁处，放着一只蓝瓷的痰盂，它像与马桶比赛似的，也是日夜张开着口，承受室内囚人吐出来的痰涕与丢下去的橘皮、蔗渣和纸屑。骤然跑进这间房来，若不是看到那只刺目的很不雅观的白木箱，以及坐在桌边那个钉着铁镣、一望而知为囚人的祥松，或者你会认为这不是一间囚室，而是一间书室了。
    的确，就是关在这室内的祥松，也认为比他十年前在省城读书时所住的校舍的房间要好一些。
    这是看守所优待室的一间房。这看守所分为两部，一部分是优待号，一部分是普通号。优待号是优待那些在政治上有地位或者是有资产的人们，他们因各种原因犯了各种罪，也要受到法律上的处罚，而他们平日过的生活以及他们的身体，都是不能耐住那普通号一样的待遇；把他们也关到普通号里去，不要一天二天，说不定都要生病或生病而死，那是万万要不得之事，故特辟优待号让他们住着，无非是期望着他们赶早悔改的意思。所以与其说优待号是监狱，或者不如说是休养所，较为恰切些，不过是不能自由出入罢了。比较那潮湿的普通号来，那是大大的不同，在普通号吃苦生病的囚人，突然看到优待号的清洁宽敞，心里果不免要发生一个是天堂、一个是地狱之感。
    因为祥松是一个重要的政治犯，官厅为了迅速改变他原来的主义信仰，才将他从普通号搬到优待号来。
    祥松前在普通号，有三个同伴同住，谈谈讲讲也颇觉容易过日，现在是孤零一人，整日坐在这囚室内，未免深感寂寞了。他不会抽烟，也不会喝酒，想借烟来散闷，酒来解愁，也是做不到的。而能使他忘怀一切的，只有读书。他从同号的难友处借了不少的书来，他原是爱读书的人，一有足够的书给他看看读读，就是他脚上钉着的十斤重的铁镣，也不觉得它怎样沉重压脚了，尤其现在，书好像是医生手里止痛的吗啡针，他一看起书来，看到津津有味之处，把他精神上的愁闷与肉体上的痛苦都麻痹地忘却了。
    到底他的脑力有限，接连看了几个钟头的书，头就会一阵一阵的胀痛起来。他将一双肘节放在桌上，用两掌抱住胀痛的头，还是照旧看下去，一面咬紧牙关自语：“尽你痛！痛！再痛！脑冲血，晕死去罢！”直到脑痛十分厉害了，不能再耐的时候，才丢下书来，在桌边站立起来。或是向铁床上一倒，四肢摊开伸直，闭上眼睛养养神；或是在室内从里面走到外面，又从外面走到里面的踱着步；再或者站在窗口望着窗外那么一小块沉闷的雨天出神；也顺便望望围墙外那株一半枯枝、一半绿叶的柳树，他一看到那一簇浓绿的柳叶，他就猜想出遍大地的树木，大概都在和暖的春风吹拂中，长出艳绿的嫩叶来了——他从这里似乎得到一点儿春意。
    他每天都是这般不变样地生活着。
    今天，在换班的看守推开门来望望他——换班交代最重要的囚人——的时候，却看到祥松没有看书，也没有踱步，他坐在桌边，用左手撑住头，右手执着笔，就纸上边写边想。祥松似乎有什么感触，要把它写出来。他在写些什么呢？啊！他在写着一封给朋友们的信。亲爱的朋友们：
    我终于被俘入狱了。
    关于我被俘入狱的情形，你们在报纸上可以看到，知道大概，我不必说了。我在被俘以后，经过绳子的绑缚，经过钉上粗重的脚镣，经过无数次的拍照，经过装甲车的押解，经过几次群众会上的示众，以及关入笼子里，这些都像放映电影一般，一幕一幕的过去。我死也不愿再回忆那些过去了的事情。回忆，只能增加我的苦恼！我不愿将我在狱中的生活告诉你们。朋友，无论谁入了狱，都得感到愁苦和屈辱，我当然更甚，所以不能告诉你们一点什么好的新闻。我今天想告诉你们的，却是另外一个比较紧要的问题，即是关于我爱中国、拯救中国的问题，你们或者高兴听一听我讲这个问题罢。
    我自从入狱后，有许多人来看我，他们为什么来看我，大概怀着到动物园里去看一只新奇的动物一样的好奇心吧！他们背后怎样评论我，我不能知道，而且也不一定要知道。就他们当面对我讲的话，他们都承认我是一个革命者；不过，他们认为我只顾到工农阶级的利益，忽视了民族的利益，好像我并不是热心爱中国、爱民族的人。朋友，这是真实的话吗？工农阶级的利益，会是与民族的利益冲突吗？不，绝不是的。真正为工农阶级谋解放的人，正是为民族谋解放的人。不爱中国，不爱民族，那简直是对我一生天大的冤枉了。
    朋友，我的话说得太噜嗦厌听了吧！好，我只说下面几句。我老实告诉你们，我爱中国之热诚，还是如小学生时代一样的真纯无伪，我要打倒帝国主义、为中国民族谋解放之心还是火一般的炽烈。不过，现在我是一个待决之囚，我没有机会为中国民族尽力了。我今日写这封信，是我为民族热情所感，用文字来作一次为在危难中的中国呼喊。
    啊！我虽然不能实际的为中国奋斗，为中国民族奋斗，但我的决心，总是日夜祷祝着中国民族在帝国主义羁绊之下解放出来之早日成功。假若我还能生存，那我生一天，就要为中国呼喊一天；假若我不能生存——死了，我流血的地方，或者在我瘞骨的地方，或许会长出一朵可爱的花来，这朵花，你们就看作是我的精诚的寄托吧！在微风的吹拂中，如果那朵花是上下点头，那就可视为我对于为中国民族解放奋斗的爱国志士在致以热诚的敬礼！如果那朵花是左右摇摆，那可视为我在提劲儿唱着革命之歌，鼓励战士们前进啦！
    亲爱的朋友们，不要悲观，不要畏馁，要奋斗，要持久的艰苦的奋斗！把各人所有的智慧才能，都提供于民族的拯救吧！无论如何，我们决不能让伟大的可爱的中国灭亡于帝国主义的肮脏之手里！
    你们挚诚的祥松
            5月2日写于囚室。
    囚人祥松将上信写好了，又从头到尾仔细修改了一次，自以为没有什么大毛病了，将它折好，套入一个大信封里，信封上写着：“寄送不知真名的朋友们钧启”。这封信，他知道是无法寄邮的，他拉开书桌的抽屉，将信放在里面，然后拖起那带了铁镣的脚，钉铛钉铛走到他的铁床边就倒下去睡了。
    他往日的睡，总是做着许多恶梦，今晚他或者能安睡一夜吧！我们盼望他能够安睡，不做一点梦，或者做个好梦。
