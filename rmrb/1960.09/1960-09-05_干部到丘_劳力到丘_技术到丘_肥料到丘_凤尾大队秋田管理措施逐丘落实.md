Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou -- The Fengwei Brigade of Aojiang Commune in Lianjiang County, Fujian Province, observes the fields, seedlings, and seasonal periods, and formulates field management measures for late rice plot by plot. It implements assigning cadres, labor, technology, and fertilizer to each plot, meticulously managing late rice, promoting good growth of late rice in every plot. First and second-class seedlings reach over 90%, laying a good foundation for balanced increased production in autumn.

After the Fengwei Brigade concentrated 80% of its labor force to complete the first weeding and topdressing of late rice, the brigade party branch organized veteran farmers, technicians, and cadres to conduct field inspections and evaluations. They discovered that due to different soil qualities and transplanting times, although the rice fields were weeded and fertilized once, the rice seedlings grew differently. The party branch further organized forces to inspect and classify each of the brigade’s two hundred seventy-eight plots, totaling two thousand five hundred sixty-two mu of land, which were roughly divided into five categories: Forty-three plots (four hundred ten mu) of sandy soil had unclean weeding and improper topdressing. Some fields were infested with pests, and the rice seedlings did not grow well; eleven plots (one hundred twenty mu) of white sticky soil did not receive enough fertilizer, and the rice seedlings' growth was also average; five plots (forty-eight mu) of stony soil had springs, low ground temperatures, and poor soil, resulting in weak and small rice seedlings; two hundred seven plots (one thousand eight hundred seventy-four mu) of fertile soil had clean weeding, sufficient fertilizer, large stalks, and green leaves, all of which were first-class seedlings; and twelve plots (one hundred ten mu) that were transplanted late had just begun to turn green due to the lack of quick-acting fertilizer, and the rice seedlings were very weak.

After analyzing the above situation, the party branch immediately convened a field meeting, mobilizing cadres, veteran farmers, technicians, commune members' representatives, and water managers to formulate field management measures plot by plot, combining seasonal factors and adapting to each field and seedling condition. The main contents of these measures are: (1) Topdressing by plot: For fertile soil, apply human manure once before the White Dew solar term, and two days after White Dew, apply potash fertilizer such as grass ash and manure pond residue to prevent lodging; sandy soil is very poor, so immediately apply cow dung, horse manure, and peanut vines, which are rich in organic matter. A few days after White Dew, apply fertilizer again based on seedling conditions to promote rice seedling tillering; stony and white sticky soil should be fertilized with mixed fertilizer, which can improve the soil and promote large ears, plump grains, and full grains. (2) Meticulously weeding by plot: Different weeding methods are adopted according to different soil qualities. For stony, white sticky, and sandy soils, use weeding rakes to remove weeds and till the soil thoroughly, which is conducive to root elongation and tillering; for other soil types, weed by hand. (3) Irrigate by plot, based on seedlings and fields: Keep the water depth between five minutes and one inch for seedlings with insufficient tillering to promote rapid tillering; irrigate one and a half to two inches for sufficient tillering to inhibit ineffective tillering. In addition, dry the fields once in the early stage of yellow ripening, and slightly irrigate again seven to ten days before harvesting to promote full grains and high yield, which is also conducive to winter plowing and winter planting. Each plot also prescribed methods for preventing and controlling diseases and pests.

After formulating field management measures plot by plot, in order to ensure full implementation, the party branch also adopted the method of "four assignments to each plot," namely: (1) Cadres assigned to each plot: All one hundred ninety-eight cadres, party members, and league members in the brigade each contracted one plot and took charge to the end. The branch secretary and six branch committee members, as well as the brigade leaders, classified and managed sixteen plots of advisory fields, directly grasping fertilization, weeding, pest control, and irrigation in order to discover problems in a timely manner, study solutions, and provide comprehensive guidance. (2) Labor assigned to each plot: In addition to the two professional teams for accumulating and manufacturing fertilizer and managing cash crops, three hundred seventy-two strong laborers out of the brigade's five hundred forty-eight agricultural laborers were divided into thirty-one operation groups according to the production team system, contracted management by zone, and implemented person-to-field correspondence to establish a responsibility system. (3) Technology assigned to each plot: All eighty-seven local experts in the brigade were reasonably assigned to operation groups, two to three people per group, to provide technical guidance. (4) Fertilizer assigned to each plot: All four hundred twelve fertilizer pits, cattle pens, pigsties, and garbage pits in the brigade were comprehensively inventoried, and various fertilizers were stored separately. Fixed storage locations were also designated for fertilizers accumulated by the fertilizer accumulation team, pig farms, cattle herders, and cafeteria cooks. Each fertilizer storage location was marked with a sign indicating the nature of the fertilizer and the fields in which it should be used, so that commune members could transport and apply fertilizer by looking at the signs.

After the Fengwei Brigade adopted these methods, it greatly promoted field management. In order to ensure good weeding of sandy soil, commune members in the Xinhua and Xinguang production teams worked during the day and repaired more than one hundred weeding rakes at night. Iron rakes were used for all weeding to ensure deep and thorough tilling, loose soil, and clean weeding, achieving high-quality weeding in sandy fields. In addition to water management, all twelve water managers in the brigade also used the early morning and evening hours to repair forty-one branch canals, ensuring smooth irrigation in every plot, achieving shallow and frequent irrigation and water in every plot. After seven days of efforts by cadres and commune members, the second weeding of the brigade had ended. In addition to fertile soil, the remaining rice fields had been topdressed once according to the measures determined by plot. Most of the four hundred ten mu of third-class seedlings had caught up with the first and second-class seedlings. (Attached picture)

### 干部到丘　劳力到丘　技术到丘　肥料到丘  凤尾大队秋田管理措施逐丘落实

    干部到丘　劳力到丘　技术到丘　肥料到丘
    凤尾大队秋田管理措施逐丘落实
    全队晚稻生长良好，一二类苗达90％以上，三类苗迅速减少
    新华社福州电　福建连江县敖江公社凤尾大队，看田、看苗、看节令，逐丘订出晚稻田间管理措施，实行干部、劳力、技术、肥料定到丘，精细管理晚稻，促使晚稻丘丘生长良好，一、二类苗达到90％以上，为秋季平衡增产打好了基础。
    凤尾大队集中80％的劳力完成晚稻第一遍耘草追肥以后，大队党支部组织老农、技术员和干部，开展了田间检查评比，发现有些稻田由于土质、插秧时间等不同，虽然同样耘了一遍草追上一次肥，但是稻苗生长不一样。党支部便进一步组织力量逐丘检查分类排队，摸清了全队二百七十八丘、二千五百六十二亩田大体分为五种情况：沙质田四十三丘四百一十亩耘草不干净、追肥不当，部分田地发生虫害，稻苗生长不好；十一丘一百二十亩白粘底田，肥吃不饱，稻苗生长也一般；五丘四十八亩石头底田，有泉水，地温低，土壤瘦，稻苗生长弱小；土质肥的田有二百零七丘一千八百七十四亩，草净肥足株大叶绿，全部是一类苗；迟插的十二丘一百一十亩，由于没有追上速效肥，才开始返青，稻苗很弱。
    党支部分析以上情况后，立即召开田头会，发动干部、老农、技术员和社员代表、管水员，结合季节，因田因苗逐丘订出田间管理措施。这些措施的主要内容是：（一）按丘追肥：土质肥的田在白露前施一次人粪，白露后二天普追一次草木灰、粪池渣等磷钾肥，以防倒伏；沙质田土质很瘦，要立即追施牛栏粪、马粪和花生藤等有机质较多的肥料，白露后几天看苗再补一次肥，促进稻苗分蘖；石头底、白粘土底的田，施用混合肥，既能改良土壤，又能促使穗大粒多、粒饱。（二）按丘精细耘草：根据不同土质采用不同的耘草方法，石头底、白粘土底和沙质田，使用耘草耙除草，把土耙烂，有利根群伸长和分蘖；其他土质的田，即用手耘草。（三）看苗看田分丘灌溉：分蘖不够的苗水深保持在五分到一寸之间，促进快分蘖；分蘖够的灌水一寸半到两寸，抑制无效分蘖。此外，到黄熟初期落干烤田一次，收割前七天到十天再稍灌一点水，促使粒饱，产量高，也有利于冬耕冬种。各丘还订出了防治病虫害的办法。
    逐丘订出田间管理措施之后，为保证全部实现，党支部又采取了“四到丘”的办法，即：（1）干部定到丘：全队一百九十八个干部、党员、团员每人包一丘，一抓到底。支部书记和六位支委、正副大队长，分类搞十六丘参谋田，直接掌握施肥、耘草、治虫、灌溉，以便及时发现问题，研究解决办法，指导全面。（2）劳力定到丘：全队五百四十八个农业劳力，除积肥造肥和管理经济作物的两个专业队外，把三百七十二个强劳力按小队建制分为三十一个作业组，分片包干管理，实行人田对号，建立责任制。（3）技术定到丘：全队八十七个土专家，合理安排到作业组，每组二到三人，进行技术指导。（4）肥料定到丘：全队把四百一十二个肥坑、牛栏、猪圈和垃圾坑都进行全面排队，各种肥料分别存放。对积肥专业队、养猪场、看牛牧童和食堂炊事员所积肥料也规定固定存放地点，每个存肥地点，都挂牌标明肥料性质和在那些田中施用，社员看牌运肥、施肥。
    凤尾大队采取这些办法以后，大大推动了田间管理。新华和新光两个小队为了保证把沙质田耘草搞好，社员们白天干活，晚上整修了一百多把耘草耙，耘田全部用铁耙，保证了把田耙深耙烂，土松草净，作到沙田耘草高质量。全队十二位管水员除了看水以外，还利用早晚时间整修了四十一条毛渠，保证丘丘灌溉畅通，作到浅水勤灌，丘丘有水。经过干部和社员七天努力，全队第二遍除草已经结束，除了土质肥的田以外，其余的稻田都根据按丘所定的措施，补追了一次肥料。四百一十亩三类苗已大部分赶上了一、二类苗。（附图片）
