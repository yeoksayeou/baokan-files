Xinhua News Agency, Ulaanbaatar, September 21st. The "Mongolian-Chinese Friendship Week" held by the Mongolian-Chinese Friendship Association to celebrate the 11th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China solemnly opened in Ulaanbaatar this afternoon.

Among those attending the opening ceremony were Molomjamtsi, member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party and First Deputy of the Council of Ministers of the Mongolian People's Republic; Baljiniyam, member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party and Deputy Chairman of the Presidium of the Great People's Hural; Dugersuren, member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party; Maidar, Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers; Shagdarjsuren, Minister of Foreign Affairs; and Natsukdorji, Vice Chairman of the Mongolian-Chinese Friendship Association.

The delegation of the Chinese-Mongolian Friendship Association, headed by Cao Diqiu, Vice President of the Chinese-Mongolian Friendship Association, and Xie Fusheng, the Chinese Ambassador to Mongolia, and embassy staff were invited to attend the opening ceremony.

Baljiniyam , member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party and Chairman of Mongolian-Chinese Friendship Association, and Cao Diqiu, head of the delegation of the Chinese-Mongolian Friendship Association, spoke at the meeting successively.

Baljiniyam said that the victory of the Chinese revolution was a huge event in world history after the victory of the Great October Socialist Revolution. He pointed out that the victory of the Chinese revolution further strengthened the strength of the socialist system and heavily struck the imperialist system. Due to the victory of the Chinese revolution, a massive national liberation movement was set off in colonies and dependent countries, especially in Asian and African countries, further accelerating the collapse of the imperialist colonial system.

He said, "In 1958, the Chinese Communist Party put forward the General Line of going all out, aiming high, and building socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results. The hardworking and intelligent Chinese people responded enthusiastically to the General Line put forward by the Communist Party and implemented a great leap forward in the first three years of the Second Five-Year Plan."

After describing the great achievements made by China in the eleven years since its founding, Baljiniyam pointed out that the attainment of these achievements is closely related to the correct leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the unbreakable friendship and fraternal cooperation of socialist countries. He said that these wonderful achievements of China have cheered the people of the socialist camp, including the Mongolian people. He then talked about the construction situation in Mongolia. He said that under the leadership of the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party, relying on the fraternal assistance of the great Soviet Union, China, and other countries in the socialist camp, and based on domestic forces, the Mongolian people have made great achievements in establishing the material and technical foundations of socialism. He said that during the period from 1961 to 1965, the proportion of Mongolia's industrial production will continue to increase, and the output value of industrial products will account for more than half of the total output value of the national economy.

Baljiniyam said that the Mongolian people, together with the countries of the socialist camp, the people of Asia and Africa who are struggling for freedom and national independence, and all progressive humanity, have consistently worked hard in the struggle for world peace and security, and will continue to work hard in the future.

He said: "We angrily condemn U.S. imperialism for occupying China's inalienable territory of Taiwan and constantly taking hostile actions to restore China's legitimate seat in the United Nations; we resolutely condemn the international reactionary forces headed by U.S . imperialis m for creating obstacles to the just cause of Asian and African people in their struggle for freedom and independence, especially recently, U.S. imperialism, under the cover of the United Nations flag, has rudely interfered in the internal affairs of the newly independent Republic of the Congo, further aggravating the tensions in the region.”

Baljiniyam said that the traditional friendly relations between the Mongolian and Chinese people have further developed under new historical conditions. The fraternal assistance given to Mongolia by the great Chinese people has made a great contribution to accelerating our country's socialist construction. He said that the friendly visit to Mongolia by Chinese Premier Zhou Enlai this year was a new step in further expanding and consolidating the friendship between the Mongolian and Chinese people.

He said that the Mongolian-Chinese Friendship Association's decision to hold Friendship Week activities on the occasion of the 11th anniversary of the founding of China will definitely make an important contribution to further consolidating the fraternal friendship and cooperation between the two peoples.

Cao Diqiu, Vice President of the Chinese-Mongolian Friendship Association, said that on the occasion of the upcoming 11th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, the Mongolian-Chinese Friendship Association decided to hold "Mongolian-Chinese Friendship Week," which once again shows the profound friendship of the Mongolian people towards the Chinese people.

He said that the people of China and Mongolia have a traditional and deep friendship. Our unity is based on the ideas of Marxism-Leninism and the principles of proletarian internationalism. For the sake of our common cause, we support each other and develop together.

He said that in the revolutionary struggle of our people, we have received continuous support from the Mongolian people. In the struggle of our people against U.S. imperialism's occupation of our sacred territory—Taiwan—and the conspiracy to create "two Chinas," we have always received the firm support of the Mongolian people. The Chinese people cherish this internationalist support and fraternal friendship of the Mongolian people and will make every effort to consolidate and develop the friendship and unity between the two peoples. He then said that in the past two days, we have personally witnessed the labor enthusiasm of the Mongolian people and the prosperous and flourishing scene in all aspects, and we firmly believe that the Mongolian people will surely achieve greater success in the upcoming Third Five-Year Plan. He said that at the present, our people, under the glorious light of Marxism-Leninism, are holding high the three red banners of the General Line for socialist construction, the Great Leap Forward,and the People's Commune, and are advancing rapidly along the direction pointed out by the Party and Chairman Mao Zedong. We have full confidence in building our country into a socialist country with highly developed modern industry, modern agriculture, and modern science and culture in a not-too-long period of time.

Before the opening ceremony of the Mongolian-Chinese Friendship Week, a photo exhibition of China's "Two Years to Complete the Five-Year Plan" was held at the "Aideb-Ochir" Cinema. After the opening ceremony, the Chinese film "Five Golden Flowers" dubbed in Mongolian was shown.

    巴尔吉尼雅姆说：中国人民在总路线指引下实现巨大跃进
    曹荻秋说：中国人民决心尽力巩固和发展中蒙友谊和团结
    新华社乌兰巴托21日电　蒙中友好协会为庆祝中华人民共和国建国十一周年而举办的“蒙中友好旬”今天下午在乌兰巴托隆重开幕。
    出席开幕式的有蒙古人民革命党中央政治局委员、蒙古人民共和国部长会议第一副主席莫洛姆扎木茨、蒙古人民革命党中央政治局委员、大人民呼拉尔主席团副主席巴尔吉尼雅姆、蒙古人民革命党中央政治局委员杜格苏伦、部长会议副主席迈达尔、外交部长沙格达尔苏伦、蒙中友好协会副主席那楚克道尔吉等人。
    以中蒙友好协会副会长曹荻秋为首的中蒙友好协会代表团、中国驻蒙古大使谢甫生和使馆人员应邀出席了开幕式。
    蒙古人民革命党中央政治局委员、蒙中友好协会主席巴尔吉尼雅姆和中蒙友好协会代表团团长曹荻秋先后在会上讲话。
    巴尔吉尼雅姆说，中国革命的胜利是伟大十月社会主义革命胜利后世界历史上发生的一个巨大事件。他指出，中国革命的胜利进一步增强了社会主义体系的力量，沉重地打击了帝国主义体系。由于中国革命的胜利，在殖民地和附属国、特别是在亚非各国，掀起了声势浩大的民族解放运动，进一步加速了帝国主义殖民体系的崩溃。
    他说，“1958年中国共产党提出了鼓足干劲，力争上游，多快好省地建设社会主义的总路线，勤劳智慧的中国人民欢欣鼓舞地响应了共产党提出的总路线，在第二个五年计划的头三年中实行了巨大的跃进。”
    巴尔吉尼雅姆在叙述了中国建国十一年来所取得的巨大成就之后指出，这些成就的取得同中国共产党的正确领导以及社会主义各国牢不可破的友谊与兄弟般的合作有密切联系。他说，中国的这些美好成就使包括蒙古人民在内的社会主义阵营各国人民欢欣鼓舞。他接着谈到了蒙古的建设情况。他说，在蒙古人民革命党的领导下，蒙古人民依靠伟大的苏联、中国和社会主义阵营其他国家兄弟般的援助，以国内的力量为基础，在建立社会主义的物质技术基础方面取得了很大成就。他说，在1961到1965年期间，蒙古工业生产的比重将不断增加，工业品产值将占国民经济总产值的一半以上。
    巴尔吉尼雅姆说，蒙古人民曾同社会主义阵营国家、同为争取自由和民族独立而斗争的亚非人民以及全体进步人类一道，在争取世界和平和安全的斗争中一贯努力，今后仍将继续努力。
    他说：“我们愤怒地谴责美帝国主义侵占中国不可分割的领土台湾，对恢复中国在联合国的合法席位不断地采取的敌对行为；我们坚决谴责以美帝国主义为首的国际反动势力给亚非人民争取自由独立的正义事业制造障碍，特别是最近美帝国主义在联合国旗帜的掩护下，粗暴地干涉新独立的刚果共和国的内政，进一步加剧了这个地区的紧张局势。”
    巴尔吉尼雅姆说，蒙中人民传统的友好关系在新的历史条件下进一步向前发展，伟大中国人民给予蒙古的兄弟般的援助，对加快我国的社会主义建设作出了巨大贡献。他说，今年中国国务院总理周恩来同志在蒙古进行的友好访问是进一步扩大和巩固蒙中人民友谊的一个新步骤。
    他说，蒙中友好协会决定在中国成立十一周年的时候举办友好旬活动，这对进一步巩固两国人民的兄弟友谊和合作必将作出重要贡献。
    中蒙友好协会副会长曹荻秋说，在中华人民共和国建国十一周年即将到来的时候，蒙中友好协会决定举行“蒙中友好旬”，这又一次显示了蒙古人民对中国人民的深情厚谊。
    他说，中蒙两国人民有着传统的深厚友谊，我们间的团结是建立在马克思列宁主义思想和无产阶级国际主义原则的基础之上的，为了我们的共同事业，我们相互支持、共同发展。
    他说，在我国人民的革命斗争中，我们曾经得到蒙古人民的不断支持。在我国人民反对美帝国主义霸占我国神圣领土——台湾和制造“两个中国”的阴谋的斗争中，也一向得到蒙古人民的坚决支持。中国人民十分珍视蒙古人民的这种国际主义支援和兄弟情谊，并将尽一切努力来巩固和发展两国人民间的友谊和团结。他接着说，这两天来我们亲眼看到蒙古人民的劳动热情和各方面欣欣向荣的大好景象，深信蒙古人民在今后的第三个五年计划中必将获得更大成就。他说，目前我国人民正在马克思列宁主义的光辉照耀下高举社会主义建设的总路线、大跃进和人民公社三面红旗，循着党和毛泽东主席所指引的方向迅猛前进。我们完全有信心在不太长的时间内把我国建设成为具有高度发展的现代工业、现代农业和现代科学文化的社会主义国家。
    蒙中友好旬开幕式前在“艾德布—奥其尔”电影院举行了中国“五年计划两年完成”的图片展览，开幕会以后放映了蒙语配音的中国影片“五朵金花”。
