　  Survey Agricultural Needs　Ascertain the Flow of Materials　Organize Transportation Promptly
　　Anhui Transportation Departments Transport Materials Ahead of the Farming Season
    (Our dispatch from Hefei, 25th) Guided by the thought of taking agriculture as the foundation, transportation departments in Anhui Province proactively understand agricultural needs, ascertain the flow, volume, and starting time of agricultural materials, and promptly dispatch vehicles and ships for transportation, ensuring that agricultural seasons are not missed.
    In the past two months, railway, shipping, highway, and other departments across the province have transported over 632,000 tons of materials to rural areas, including seeds, fertilizers, pesticides, and agricultural machinery; simultaneously, they have transported out a large quantity of local specialties and agricultural by-products.
    Anhui Province's transportation units frequently inquire with key factories, seed bureaus, grain bureaus, and commercial bureaus to ascertain the quantity and general flow direction of materials requiring transportation, reporting them to the Provincial Transportation Command; the Provincial Transportation Command then convenes representatives from major materials departments and transportation units to conduct comprehensive balancing and issue instructions for implementation in various regions. After receiving the issued plans, transportation units frequently contact consigning units to ascertain the storage locations, quantities, and starting times of materials, dispatching vehicles and ships for transportation on schedule. Concurrently, transportation units also dispatch freight personnel to county commercial bureaus, forestry bureaus, grain bureaus, and communes near major transportation lines to understand the quantity of local specialties and agricultural by-products to be shipped out, ensuring that vehicles and ships can promptly load local specialties and agricultural by-products for transportation after unloading fertilizers, pesticides, agricultural machinery, and other materials.
    Since adopting this approach, Anhui Province's transportation departments have achieved excellent results. The Bengbu Railway Bureau assigns dedicated personnel to inquire with materials departments about cargo dispatch times, quantities, and other information, promptly allocating vehicles for loading and transportation, ensuring that agricultural materials are transported upon arrival at the station without any accumulation. In addition to assigning dedicated personnel to regularly inquire with commercial, agricultural machinery, and other departments about material transportation, the Hefei Bus Station recently selected eight freight personnel and dispatched them to counties such as Lu'an, Feixi, Chaoxian, Yuexi, and Shucheng to understand the transportation quantities of local specialties and agricultural by-products from grain bureaus, commercial bureaus, and key communes, utilizing returning empty vehicles for transportation, ensuring the timely transportation of materials needed to be transported into and out of rural areas. For example, in late August, after learning that the Provincial Department of Commerce had 80 tons of carrot seeds to be transported to counties such as Susong, Shucheng, Lu'an, and Jinzhai, the station immediately dispatched vehicles for transportation, completing the task in just about a week, meeting the planting needs of rural communes. At the same time, tea, hemp, and other local specialties and agricultural by-products were transported out of rural areas. For urgently needed materials not included in the plan, the transportation departments also make every effort to arrange transportation means or adopt piggyback transportation methods to promptly transport them.

　  调查农业需要　摸清物资流向　及时组织运送
　　安徽交通部门运物资赶在农时前头
    本报合肥25日电　安徽省交通运输部门在以农业为基础的思想指导下，主动了解农业需要，摸清农业需用物资的流向、流量和启运时间，及时调派车船运送，做到不误农时。
    近两个月来，全省铁路、航运、公路等部门共给农村运送了种子、肥料、农药、农业机械等物资六十三万二千多吨；同时，运出了大批土特产和农副产品。
    安徽省各交通运输单位经常向重点工厂、种子局、粮食局、商业局摸清需要运输的物资的数量和大体流向，上报省运输指挥部；由省运输指挥部召集主要物资部门和交通运输单位的代表，进行综合平衡，下达各地执行。各交通运输单位在接到下达的计划后，经常与托运单位联系，摸清物资的堆存地点、数量以及启运时间，按时调派车船运送。与此同时，各运输单位还派货运人员，到主要运输线路附近的县商业局、林业局、粮食局以及公社，了解外运的土特产和农副产品的数量，使车船载运的化肥、农药、农业机械等物资卸空后，能及时装上土特产和农副产品运输出来。
    安徽省交通运输部门采取这一作法以后，收到了很好的效果。蚌埠铁路局固定专人向物资部门了解货物发送时间、数量等情况，及时拨车装运，使农业用物资进站后，随到随运，没有积压。合肥汽车站除有专人向商业、农业机械等部门经常了解物资运输情况以外，最近抽出了八名货运人员，分别到六安、肥西、巢县、岳西、舒城等县，向粮食局、商业局以及重点公社了解土特产品和农副产品运输数量，利用回空汽车装运，使农村需要运进和运出的物资都能及时运送。如8月下旬，这个站了解到省商业厅有八十吨胡萝卜子要运往宿松、舒城、六安、金寨等县的情况后，随即派出汽车装运，仅在一星期左右时间内就运完了，适应了农村公社播种的需要，同时，从农村运出了茶叶、麻等土特产和农副产品。对于没有安排在计划内的急运物资，运输部门也都尽量安排运输工具，或采取捎脚运输的方法，及时运出。
