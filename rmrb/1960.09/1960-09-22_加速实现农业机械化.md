　　Agricultural mechanization is one of the most important conditions for increasing labor productivity. By accelerating agricultural mechanization and greatly increasing agricultural labor productivity, we can more quickly increase the total output of agricultural products and the commodity rate of agricultural products. Taking Heilongjiang Province as an example, in 1959, the state-owned Zhaoguang Farm, which basically achieved mechanization, produced an average of more than 40,000 catties of grain per laborer, with a commodity rate of 75%. Baiquan County, which partially used machines for production, produced an average of more than 10,000 catties of grain per agricultural laborer, with a commodity rate of over 50%; while production teams that mainly used old-fashioned farm tools could only produce 3,000 to several thousand catties of grain per laborer, with a commodity rate of only 40%. This powerfully demonstrates that only by accelerating agricultural mechanization can we greatly increase labor productivity. With greatly increased labor productivity, in agricultural production, we can solve problems such as water conservancy, fertilizer sources, and soil improvement according to higher standards, comprehensively implement intensive farming on all cultivated land, ensure that all production is timely and in accordance with the agricultural season, open up wasteland and expand the area of multiple cropping on a larger scale, and more effectively develop diversified operations. By achieving all of this, the yield per unit area and total output of crops will increase significantly, and agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline production, and fisheries, as well as collectively run industries, will develop more smoothly. With the improvement of agricultural mechanization and electrification, we can produce far more grain, non-staple foods, and industrial raw materials with less labor than we do now, further meeting the needs of national economic construction.
    Under the leadership of the Party, China's agricultural mechanization has been developing year by year. The pace of development has accelerated even more since the rural areas realized the people's commune system. In the past two years, there has been a significant increase in tractors, power drainage and irrigation machinery, and tillage machinery for agricultural use. Small rural power stations and hydro-power stations are being built in large numbers throughout the country. Since last winter, 110 agricultural machinery test bases have been established in 27 provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions across the country. In Heilongjiang Province, one of the key areas for agricultural mechanization, the area under mechanical cultivation has accounted for more than 20% of the total cultivated area, and 30 counties have basically achieved mechanization or semi-mechanization of grain and rice processing, feed crushing, and cooking operations. Due to the great development of the rural tool reform movement throughout the country, many places have basically achieved semi-mechanization in many operations. These are all great achievements. We must build on our existing achievements, go all out, be practical and realistic, and strive to complete the glorious task of agricultural mechanization proposed by the Party Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong to the people of the whole country in about ten years.
    Accelerating agricultural mechanization is now possible with many more favorable conditions than at any time in the past. The consolidation and sound development of the people's communes has put forward urgent demands for the realization of agricultural modernization, and has also created very favorable conditions for the realization of agricultural modernization. Thanks to the victorious development of socialist industrial construction, our industry is already able to equip agriculture with more equipment. This year, the state has allocated 1.1 million tons of steel for the agricultural machinery industry alone, double the amount of last year. In particular, after Comrade Mao Zedong explicitly proposed that the development of the national economy during the period of socialist construction should be based on agriculture, the leadership of the Party committees at all levels over agriculture has been further strengthened, and the support of all walks of life, especially industry, for agriculture has formed a mass movement. As long as we fully utilize the many favorable conditions, take effective measures, and further strengthen the Party's leadership over agricultural technological transformation, China's agricultural mechanization will surely advance victoriously at a faster pace.
    In order to accelerate agricultural mechanization, all regions should, in accordance with the Party Central Committee's guidelines for agricultural technological transformation and in light of the specific conditions of their regions, formulate a comprehensive plan for achieving agricultural mechanization. In this plan, it is necessary to effectively set targets for increasing the area under mechanical cultivation, the area under mechanical drainage and irrigation, and the mechanization or semi-mechanization of other non-field operations year by year. Field operations are the decisive link in agricultural production, they also occupy the most labor, and the implementation of mechanization is also the most complex, and should be listed as the focus of mechanization. At the same time, attention should also be paid to some non-field operations, such as threshing, grain processing, feed processing, public canteen cooking equipment, etc., because it is easier to achieve mechanization and semi-mechanization in these areas, the funds required are not large, and the technology is easy to master. Realizing the technological transformation of these operations as soon as possible can free up a large amount of labor to strengthen agricultural production. This is in general agricultural areas. As for pastoral areas, fishing areas, forest areas, and areas where certain special products are concentrated (such as sericulture, tea production, fruit tree cultivation, etc.), it is of course also necessary to stipulate the key points and specific steps for implementing mechanization and semi-mechanization according to their specific conditions.
    China's agricultural mechanization movement is a national mass technological innovation and technological revolution movement. This movement includes two forces: one is the professional team for agricultural machinery testing, research and manufacturing, and the other is the mass team of hundreds of millions of farmers directly participating in the tool reform movement. Whether agricultural mechanization can be accelerated mainly depends on the breadth and depth of the development of the mass movements on both sides, and depends on the close integration of the two. Therefore, in the process of agricultural mechanization, it is necessary to resolutely criticize the erroneous thinking of "valuing foreign technology and belittling indigenous methods," and it is necessary to prevent the thinking of neglecting the development of livestock because of the desire to implement mechanization. On the one hand, the national industry must produce more agricultural machinery to supply the rural areas, and on the other hand, it is also necessary to vigorously carry out mass tool reform movements, actively promote improved tools and semi-mechanized tools to replace old-fashioned tools. In recent years, it is precisely because we have adhered to this correct guideline put forward by the Party Central Committee, and adhered to the correct guideline of combining foreign and indigenous methods and combining mechanization and semi-mechanization, that we have successfully created many new types of agricultural machinery that meet China's characteristics and intensive farming requirements. In order to accelerate the realization of agricultural mechanization, it is necessary to further develop the tool reform movement more deeply while further strengthening agricultural machinery scientific research and manufacturing work. In this movement, it is particularly necessary to first grasp the production tools and main operation tools of the main crops and carry out serialized reforms.
    Agricultural mechanization is an extremely complex and arduous task, and we must constantly accumulate experience and conscientiously study and solve new problems that arise in the movement. All agricultural mechanization demonstration areas and advanced areas across the country, in particular, should do a good job and undertake the glorious task of providing experience and technology in this regard.
    The process of realizing agricultural mechanization is essentially the process of industry equipping agriculture. Without a strong industrial base and without the widespread support of industry, there would be no agricultural mechanization. In order to give full play to the huge role of industry in equipping agriculture, it is first necessary to strengthen the national agricultural machinery manufacturing industry sector. Modern large-scale agricultural machinery factories are the backbone force for equipping agriculture, and their task is to produce more modern agricultural machinery suitable for China's cultivation needs. China has a vast territory, complex farming conditions, and requires a wide variety of agricultural machinery. The products of a few large-scale agricultural machinery factories cannot meet the needs of all regions. Therefore, it is necessary to conscientiously implement the policy of simultaneously developing central enterprises and local enterprises, and simultaneously developing large, medium, and small enterprises. Provinces, municipalities, autonomous regions, prefectures, and counties should actively arrange and develop their own regional agricultural machinery manufacturing industries according to needs and possibilities. At present, in agricultural machinery production, attention should be paid to ensuring the quality of machines. The main engine and accessories must be complete sets, and parts must be fully stocked. Only in this way can we ensure that when a machine is built, it can be used, and the role of agricultural machinery can be fully utilized. In agricultural machinery production, we must also pay attention to the problem of saving materials and the comprehensive utilization of machines, and strive to build more machines with less steel materials, and strive to use one machine for the work of several machines.
    In order to accelerate the realization of agricultural mechanization, while agricultural machinery is being sent to the countryside, it is necessary to actively establish and improve the agricultural machinery repair and parts network in rural areas. Because only when the rural areas have repair capabilities can the large amount of agricultural machinery supplied by the state to the rural areas fully play its due role. Therefore, counties and people's communes must establish their own agricultural machinery repair and parts industry and raw material industry for agricultural machinery services with the strong help of the national industrial departments. With a relatively sound agricultural machinery repair and parts network, we can gradually achieve "major repairs not leaving the county, medium repairs not leaving the commune, and minor repairs not leaving the team."
    Supporting agricultural technological transformation is not only the responsibility of the industrial sector, but also the responsibility of other departments and other industries. All departments across the country, including industry, transportation, finance, trade, finance, science, education, culture, health, etc., should always care about agriculture and actively and proactively serve the technological transformation of agriculture through their own business.
    With the development of agricultural mechanization, the task of training technical personnel is even more important. All regions and people's communes should take all effective measures to train a large number of technical backbones and skilled agricultural machinery operators in a planned way. In this regard, the industrial sector, the education sector, and the science sector should also provide strong assistance.
    Realizing agricultural mechanization in an agricultural country like ours with a rural population of 500 million is a great and profound technological revolution, and it is an arduous and glorious historical task for our generation. The people of the whole country should, under the leadership of the Party, hold high the banner of the general line of socialist construction, combine the revolutionary spirit of advancing bravely with the scientific spirit of seeking truth from facts, work diligently and thriftily, and strive to accelerate the completion of this glorious historical task!

　　加速实现农业机械化
    农业机械化是提高劳动生产率的最重要条件之一。加速推进农业机械化，大大提高农业劳动生产率，我们才能更快地增加农产品的总产量和农产品的商品率。以黑龙江省的事实为例，1959年，基本上实现了机械化的国营赵光农场平均每个劳动力生产粮食四万多斤，商品率达75％。部分使用机器生产的拜泉县平均每个农业劳动力生产粮食一万多斤，商品率占50％以上；而主要使用旧式农具的生产队平均每个劳动力只能生产粮食三几千斤，商品率只占40％。这就有力地说明，只有加速实现农业机械化，才能大大提高劳动生产率。劳动生产率大大提高了，在农业生产上，我们就能按照更高的标准解决水利、肥源、土壤改良等问题，就能在全部耕地上更全面地实行精耕细作，就能使各项生产抢上季节不违农时，就能更大规模地开垦荒地和扩大复种面积，就能更有成效地开展多种经营。而做到了这一切，农作物单位面积产量和总产量就会大幅度地增长，农林牧副渔各业和社办工业就会更顺利地向前发展。随着农业机械化、电气化水平的提高，我们就可以用较少的劳动力生产出比现在多得多的粮食、副食品和工业原料，进一步满足国家经济建设的需要。
    我国的农业机械化事业在党的领导下是逐年向前发展的，农村实现人民公社化后发展的速度更加加快了。两年来，农业用的拖拉机、排灌动力机械、耕作机械有了显著的增加，农村小型发电站和水力站正在各地大量兴办。去年冬季以来，全国二十七个省、市、自治区已经建立了一百一十个农业机械试验基点。农业机械化重点地区之一的黑龙江省，机耕面积已占总耕地面积的20％以上，已有三十个县基本上实现了粮米加工、饲料粉碎、炊事等作业的机械化或半机械化。由于农村工具改革运动在全国范围内有了很大的发展，许多地方已有不少作业基本上实现了半机械化。这些都是很大的成绩。我们要在已有成就的基础上鼓足干劲，切切实实，有计划有步骤地争取在十年左右的时间内完成党中央和毛泽东同志给全国人民提出的农业机械化的光荣任务。
    加速实现农业机械化，已经有了许多比过去任何时候都有利得多的条件。人民公社的巩固和健全的发展，对实现农业现代化提出了迫切的要求，也为实现农业现代化创造了很有利的条件。由于社会主义工业建设的胜利发展，我们的工业已经有可能用更多的装备来武装农业。今年仅仅国家拨给农业机械工业方面使用的钢材就有一百一十万吨，比去年增加一倍。特别是毛泽东同志明确提出在社会主义建设时期发展国民经济要以农业为基础的方针以后，各级党委对于农业的领导已经进一步加强，各行各业特别是工业对农业的支援已经形成群众性运动。只要我们充分地运用许多有利条件，采取有效措施，进一步加强党对农业技术改造的领导，我国农业机械化事业一定能够以更快的速度胜利前进。
    为了加速实现农业机械化，各个地区应当根据党中央所规定的农业技术改造的方针，结合本地区的具体情况，制定出实现农业机械化的全面规划。在这个规划中，要切实地定出逐年提高机耕面积、机械排灌面积以及其他非田间作业的机械化或半机械化的指标。田间作业是农业生产的决定性环节，它占用劳动力也最多，实施机械化也最复杂，应当列为机械化的重点。同时，对有些非田间作业，如脱粒、粮谷加工、饲料加工、公共食堂炊事工具等等也应重视，因为这些方面实现机械化半机械化比较容易，所需要的资金不多，技术也容易掌握，尽快实现这些作业的技术改造，可以腾出大量的劳动力加强农业生产。这是就一般农业地区来说的，至于牧区、渔区、林区以及某些特产集中（如养蚕、茶叶生产、果树栽培等）的地区，当然也需要根据各自的具体情况，规定实施机械化半机械化的重点和具体步骤。
    我国的农业机械化运动是一个全民性的技术革新和技术革命运动。这个运动包括两个方面的力量：一方面是农业机械试验研究和制造的专业队伍，一方面是千百万农民直接参加的工具改革运动的群众队伍。农业机械化能否加速实现，主要取决于这两方面的群众运动发展的广度和深度，取决于两者的密切结合。因此，在农业机械化过程中，必须坚决批判那种“重洋轻土”的错误思想，必须防止因为要实行机械化就不关心发展牲畜的思想。一方面，国家工业要生产更多的农业机械来供应农村，另方面，也要大搞群众性的工具改革运动，积极推广改良工具和半机械化工具，用以代替旧式工具。这几年来，正是由于我们坚持了党中央提出的这个正确的方针，坚持了洋土并举、机械化和半机械化并举的正确方针，我们才创制成功了不少符合我国特点和精耕细作要求的新式农业机械。为了加速农业机械化的实现，必须在进一步加强农业机械科学研究和制造工作的同时，更深入地发展工具改革运动。在这个运动中，特别要首先抓住主要农作物的生产工具和主要作业工具进行系列化的改革。
    农业机械化是一项极为复杂、艰巨的任务，我们必须不断地积累经验，认真地研究和解决运动过程中发生的新问题。全国一切农业机械化示范区和先进地区，特别应当做好工作，在这方面担负起出经验、出技术的光荣任务。
    实现农业机械化的过程，实质上是工业武装农业的过程。没有强大的工业基础，没有工业的广泛支援，就没有农业机械化。为了充分发挥工业武装农业的巨大作用，首先要加强国家农业机械制造工业部门。现代化的大型农业机械工厂是武装农业的骨干力量，它们的任务是生产更多的适合我国耕作需要的现代化农业机械。我国地区辽阔，耕作条件复杂，需要的农业机械多种多样，少数大型农业机械工厂的产品不可能满足各地的需要。因此，必须切实贯彻执行中央企业和地方企业同时并举、大中小型同时并举的方针。省、市、自治区和专区、县都应该根据需要和可能，积极安排和发展自己地区的农业机械制造工业。目前，在农业机械生产当中，应当注意保证机器的质量。主机和配件必须成套，零件必须备足。只有这样，才能做到造出一台、用上一台，充分发挥农业机械的作用。在农业机械生产中，还要注意节约材料和机器的综合利用的问题，力求用较少的钢铁材料造出更多的机具，力求一台机器顶几台机器用。
    为了加速实现农业机械化，应当在农业机械下乡的同时，积极建立和健全农村中的农业机械修配网。因为只有在农村有了修配能力的条件下，国家供应到农村中的大量农业机械才能充分发挥应有的作用。因此，县和人民公社必须在国家工业部门的大力帮助下建立自己的农业机械修配工业和为农业机械服务的原材料工业。有了比较健全的农业机械修配网，就可以逐步做到“大修不出县、中修不出社、小修不出队”。
    支援农业技术改造，不只是工业部门的责任，也是其他部门、其他行业的责任，全国工业、交通、财政、贸易、金融、科学、教育、文化、卫生等各个部门，都应当经常关心农业，通过自己的业务，积极主动地为农业的技术改造服务。
    随着农业机械化的发展，培养技术力量的任务更加重要了。各个地区和人民公社应当采取一切有效措施，有计划地大量培养技术骨干和熟练的农业机械操作手。在这方面，工业部门、教育部门和科学部门同样应当大力给予帮助。
    在我们这样一个拥有五亿农村人口的农业大国实现农业机械化，是一个伟大的、深刻的技术革命，是我们这一代的一个艰巨而光荣的历史任务。全国人民应当在党的领导下，高举社会主义建设总路线的旗帜，把一往无前的革命气魄和实事求是的科学精神结合起来，克勤克俭，为加速完成这一光荣的历史任务而奋斗！
