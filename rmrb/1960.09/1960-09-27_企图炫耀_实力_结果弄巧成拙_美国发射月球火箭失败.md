Xinhua News Agency, 26th: Cape Canaveral (USA) Dispatch: The "Pioneer VI" lunar rocket, which the United States was preparing to flaunt at the United Nations General Assembly, failed shortly after its launch on September 25th.

The rocket was launched at Cape Canaveral on the 25th at 15:13 International Standard Time. After the launch, the United States mobilized a large number of propaganda machines to boast that this rocket would be the first to become a lunar satellite, orbiting the moon every ten hours after sixty-two hours of launch, with the aim of overshadowing the Soviet Union's leading position in lunar exploration.

However, the Atlas rocket used for the launch was very disappointing. The United States National Aeronautics and Space Administration had to announce that one of the front stages of the rocket had malfunctioned, and the launch had failed.

　　企图炫耀“实力”　结果弄巧成拙
　　美国发射月球火箭失败
    据新华社26日讯　卡纳维拉尔角（美国）消息：美国准备在联合国大会期间大吹大擂的“先驱者六号”月球火箭，在9月25日发射后不久遭到了失败。
    火箭是在25日国际标准时间十五时十三分在卡纳维拉尔角发射的。发射后美国开动大批宣传机器进行吹嘘，说这个火箭要第一次成为月球卫星，在发射六十二小时后每十小时将绕月球运行一周，目的是想以此盖过苏联在探测月球方面的领先地位。
    可是，发射用的阿特拉斯火箭十分不争气。美国国家航空和宇宙航行局就不得不宣布，火箭的前头几节之一失灵，发射遭到了失败。
