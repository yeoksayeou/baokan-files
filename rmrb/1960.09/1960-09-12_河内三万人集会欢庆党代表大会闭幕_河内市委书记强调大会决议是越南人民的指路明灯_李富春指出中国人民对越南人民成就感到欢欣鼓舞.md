    At the beginning of the rally, Comrade Tran Danh Tuyen, Secretary of the Hanoi Municipal Party Committee, spoke on behalf of the people of Hanoi, warmly congratulating the Party Congress on its great achievements. On behalf of all the people of the capital, he expressed absolute trust in the newly elected Central Committee of the Labor Party headed by President Ho Chi Minh.

    Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, September 11th: Li Fuchun, head of the Chinese Communist Party delegation attending the Third National Congress of the Vietnam Workers' Party, delivered a speech at the mass rally held in Hanoi today to celebrate the victorious closing of the Third National Congress of the Vietnam Workers' Party. The full text is as follows:

    Dear comrades and friends:

    Our Chinese Communist Party delegation, along with you, warmly celebrated the fifteenth anniversary of the founding of your great country, and was honored to participate in the glorious Third Congress of the Vietnam Workers' Party, and was extremely excited and encouraged to see the complete success of the Congress. On behalf of the Chinese Communist Party and the Chinese people, we extend our warmest congratulations to the people of Vietnam and the people of Hanoi.
    Under the correct leadership of the Central Committee of the Vietnam Workers' Party and President Ho Chi Minh, the heroic People of Vietnam achieved victory in the great August Revolution General Uprising fifteen years ago, establishing the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. This is a great and glorious undertaking created by the Vietnamese nation, and it began a new era in Vietnamese history.

    The Central Committee of the Vietnam Workers' Party and President Ho Chi Minh also led the heroic Vietnamese people in persistently adhering to a long-term resistance war of nine years, giving the French colonialists and American interventionists a severe blow. After the Vietnamese people won the decisive victory in the Dien Bien Phu campaign, the French colonialists were finally forced to reach the Geneva Agreement with the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, restoring peace to Indochina. This is a major contribution of the Vietnamese people to the cause of peace in Asia and the world.

    For nearly six years, the Central Committee of the Vietnam Workers' Party and President Ho Chi Minh have also led the diligent and brave Vietnamese people in starting to build their new life in the completely liberated North. The Vietnamese people have victoriously completed land reform, rapidly restored the national economy, and on this basis, launched a vigorous socialist revolution and socialist construction, striving for great victories in politics, economy, culture, science, and technology. That is to say, the people of North Vietnam have embarked on the broad road of socialism. As close brothers and comrades-in-arms of the Vietnamese people, the Chinese people are extremely delighted and encouraged by the above-mentioned brilliant achievements you have made.

    Now, the southern part of your country is still under the rule of U.S. imperialism and its running dog Ngo Dinh Diem clique, where it has virtually become a U.S. colony, presenting a tragic scene. Now the Vietnamese people are waging a resolute struggle for the peaceful reunification of the motherland under the leadership of the Party Central Committee and President Ho. This struggle of the Vietnamese people is a patriotic and just struggle. We fully sympathize with and support this just struggle.

    The Third Congress of the Vietnam Workers' Party summarized the rich revolutionary experience of the past, formulated a correct revolutionary line for building socialism in North Vietnam and for the struggle to realize the country's peaceful reunification, and put forward great and glorious revolutionary tasks for the future. We firmly believe that under the illumination of this correct line, the fraternal Vietnamese people will surely continue to develop the fine tradition of hard work, go all out, and victoriously realize the great call put forward by the Congress, so as to build your country better and more powerful. We also firmly believe that under the illumination of this correct line, the fraternal Vietnamese people, through unyielding struggle, will surely realize the peaceful reunification of Vietnam's sacred territory, and U.S. imperialism and the Ngo Dinh Diem clique will surely suffer a shameful defeat.

    The people of China and Vietnam are neighboring brothers and close comrades-in-arms. We have always cared for and supported each other in the struggle for national liberation. At present, in the struggle against our common enemy, U.S. imperialism, in the cause of socialist construction, in the cause of safeguarding peace in Asia and the world, and in supporting the just struggle of the people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America for national independence and liberation, we are supporting each other, encouraging each other, cooperating closely, and advancing side by side. This mutual cooperation between us promotes the common upsurge of the economies and cultures of the two countries, strengthens the strength of the socialist camp, and is beneficial to maintaining peace in Asia and the world.

    The Chinese people are now under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party headed by Chairman Mao Zedong, under the guidance of the three red banners of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Commune, and are continuing to carry out the socialist revolution in depth and rapidly develop the socialist construction cause. Our people have waged a resolute struggle against the most vicious enemy of the people of the world, U.S. imperialists, in order to defend world peace and realize the peaceful coexistence of countries with different social systems. This struggle of our people has heavily hit the U.S. imperialist policy of aggression and policy of war, and thus U.S. imperialism particularly crazily hates and attacks our country. But we have won the universal sympathy of all oppressed nations and oppressed people and peace-loving people of all countries.

    Dear comrades, friends, let us, the two parties and two peoples of China and Vietnam, unite more closely, let us, the people of all countries in the socialist camp and the peace-loving people of the whole world, unite more closely, and advance hand in hand for the noble cause of world peace and human progress!

    Long live the unbreakable fraternal unity between the two parties and two peoples of China and Vietnam!

    Long live the great unity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union!

    Long live the hardworking and brave Vietnamese people!

    Long live the Vietnam Workers' Party!

    Long live President Ho Chi Minh!

    新华社河内11日电　越南首都河内各界人民代表三万人，今晚兴高采烈地聚集在河内“行底”运动场，热烈庆祝越南劳动党第三次全国代表大会胜利闭幕。
    胡志明主席参加了今晚的庆祝大会。
    参加庆祝大会的还有许多越南劳动党和国家领导人。
    参加庆祝大会的还有应邀参加越南劳动党第三次全国代表大会的苏联、中国、阿尔巴尼亚、保加利亚、波兰、德意志民主共和国、匈牙利、蒙古、罗马尼亚、朝鲜民主主义人民共和国、捷克斯洛伐克等兄弟党的代表团和法国、印度、印度尼西亚、日本等国的共产党代表团以及其他一些国家的兄弟党的代表。
      “行底”运动场今晚人山人海，彩旗、越南民主共和国的金星红旗和兄弟国家的国旗在灯光下耀相辉映，青年男女们都穿起了最漂亮的节日盛装。
    大会开始时，河内市党委书记陈名宣同志首先代表河内人民讲话，热烈祝贺党代会取得的巨大成就。他代表首都全体人民表示绝对信赖新选出的以胡志明主席为首的劳动党中央委员会。
    他说：“这次党代会是我国革命历史中，党和人民的政治生活中无比重大的事件。大会的历史性的决议，是引导我国人民前进，在北方建设社会主义和统一祖国的斗争事业中取得更大胜利的指路明灯。”
    陈名宣最后表示首都河内市全体党员和人民将彻底执行大会的历史性的决议，更进一步努力建设社会主义的首都，胜利地实现第一个五年计划，为北方快、猛、稳地向社会主义迈进和在实现统一祖国的斗争中作出应有的贡献。
  　接着，越南劳动党第一书记黎笋宣读了昨天在党代会上通过的告全党全民的“呼吁书”。这时，全场响起了雷鸣般的掌声。
    随后，苏联、中国、朝鲜党政代表团团长和法国、印度尼西亚共产党代表团团长在大会上相继讲话。大会最后全场起立合唱国际歌。大会结束后在灿烂的灯光下举行了有成千人参加的大合唱和几千人表演的各种集体节目。
    新华社河内11日电　出席越南劳动党第三次全国代表大会的中国共产党代表团团长李富春，今天在河内举行的庆祝越南劳动党第三次全国代表大会胜利闭幕的群众大会上发表讲话，全文如下：
    亲爱的同志们、朋友们：
    我们中国共产党代表团，同你们一道热烈地庆贺了你们的伟大国家建国十五周年，又荣幸地参加了光荣的越南劳动党第三次代表大会，看到了大会的圆满成功，感到万分兴奋和鼓舞。我们谨代表中国共产党和中国人民向越南全国人民和河内全市人民表示最热烈的祝贺。
    在越南劳动党中央和胡志明主席的正确领导下，英雄的越南人民，在十五年前，取得了伟大的八月革命总起义的胜利，建立了越南民主共和国。这是越南民族所创造的伟大的和光辉的事业，它开始了越南历史的新纪元。
    越南劳动党中央和胡志明主席还领导英雄的越南人民，顽强不屈地坚持了九年的长期抗战，给予了法国殖民主义者和美国干涉者以狠狠的打击。当越南人民取得了奠边府战役的决定性胜利以后，法国殖民主义者终于被迫同越南民主共和国达成日内瓦协议，恢复了印度支那的和平。这是越南人民对亚洲和世界和平事业所作出的重大的贡献。
    越南劳动党中央和胡志明主席，近六年来，又领导勤劳勇敢的越南人民，在完全解放了的北方，开始建设自己的新生活。越南人民胜利地完成了土地改革，迅速地恢复了国民经济，并且在这个基础上，轰轰烈烈地展开了社会主义革命和社会主义建设，争取了政治、经济、文化和科学技术等各方面的伟大胜利。这就是说，越南北方的人民已经走上了社会主义的康庄大道。作为越南人民的亲密兄弟和战友的中国人民，对于你们所取得的上述的辉煌成就，感到极大的欢欣鼓舞。
    现在你们国家的南方，还仍然处在美帝国主义及其走狗吴庭艳集团统治之下，那里实际上已经成为美国的殖民地，呈现出一片悲惨的景象。现在越南人民正在劳动党中央和胡主席的领导下，为实现祖国的和平统一进行着坚决的斗争。越南人民的这个斗争是爱国的正义的斗争。我们完全同情和支持这个正义的斗争。
    越南劳动党第三次代表大会总结了过去丰富的革命经验，为在越南北方建设社会主义，为实现国家的和平统一的斗争，制定了正确的革命路线，提出了今后伟大的光荣的革命任务。我们深深相信，在这个正确路线的照耀之下，兄弟的越南人民，一定能够继续发挥辛勤劳动的优良传统，鼓足干劲，胜利地实现大会提出的伟大号召，把你们的国家建设得更好，建设得更为强盛。我们也深深相信，在这个正确路线照耀之下，兄弟的越南人民，通过不屈不挠的斗争，一定能够实现越南的神圣国土的和平统一，美帝国主义和吴庭艳集团必将遭到可耻的失败。
    中越两国人民，是邻邦兄弟和亲密的战友。我们在争取民族解放的斗争中，一向是互相关怀和互相支持的。目前，我们在反对我们共同敌人美帝国主义的斗争中，在建设社会主义的事业中，在保卫亚洲和世界的和平的事业中，在支持亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲人民争取民族独立和解放的正义斗争中，都是互相支持，互相鼓舞，紧密合作，并肩前进。我们之间的这种互相合作，促进了两国经济、文化的共同高涨，加强了社会主义阵营的力量，又是有利于维护亚洲和世界和平的。
    我们中国人民现在正在以毛泽东主席为首的中国共产党的领导下，在总路线、大跃进、人民公社三面红旗的指引下，继续深入地进行社会主义革命和迅速地发展社会主义的建设事业。我国人民为着保卫世界和平，实现不同社会制度国家的和平共处，同世界人民最凶恶的敌人美帝国主义者进行了坚决的斗争。我国人民的这种斗争，沉重地打击了美帝国主义的侵略政策和战争政策，因而美帝国主义也就特别疯狂地仇视和攻击我国。但是我们却赢得了一切被压迫民族和被压迫人民以及各国爱好和平的人民的普遍同情。
    亲爱的同志们，朋友们，让我们中越两党和两国人民更加紧密地团结起来，让我们社会主义阵营各国人民和全世界爱好和平的人民更加紧密地团结起来，为着世界和平和争取人类进步的崇高事业而携手前进吧！
    中越两党两国人民牢不可破的兄弟团结万岁！
    以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的伟大团结万岁！
    勤劳勇敢的越南人民万岁！
    越南劳动党万岁！
    胡志明主席万岁！
