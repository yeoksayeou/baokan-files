On May 5th of this year, we published an editorial entitled: "Plant More, Plant Even More!" The purpose of planting more is to harvest more. On the basis of planting more, after months of hard work in management and disaster relief, most areas have reached the autumn harvest season. Now, our slogan is: Harvest more, harvest even more!

Is it still possible to rely on subjective efforts to strive for more and even more harvest during the harvest season? It is entirely possible. As long as we harvest at the right time and with meticulous care, we can harvest more. There are ways to strive for more and even more harvest in terms of mastering the harvest time, rationally organizing labor, improving operating methods, and reforming harvesting tools.

The working farmers cherish their fruits of labor very much and have a lot of experience in careful harvesting and meticulous threshing. As the saying goes, "Every grain of food is a drop of sweat, every grain of food is exchanged for blood and sweat; without seventy-two procedures, it is not easy to get food to your mouth." This year's autumn harvest in many areas is the result of fighting against serious natural disasters, and it is particularly hard-won. In the previous period, in the harvesting of early autumn crops, rural people's communes in various places treated the autumn harvest with the spirit of increasing production and practicing economy, and generally did it more meticulously than in previous years. However, it cannot be ignored that in many places, under the new conditions of large-scale collective production, experience in how to implement careful harvesting and meticulous threshing is still insufficient. This year's autumn crops are planted a lot, the time is uneven, and the situation is more complicated. In order to timely autumn sowing, for mid-autumn crops and late-autumn crops, we must strive to harvest early, harvest quickly, race against time, and clear the stubble, which makes it easier to harvest less carefully. Therefore, we must not relax the leadership of the autumn harvest, and even less should we think that there is not much potential for increasing production and practicing economy in the autumn harvest process, and relax subjective efforts.

To understand how much potential there is in careful harvesting and meticulous threshing, it is best to conduct an on-site inspection at the beginning of the autumn harvest. According to recent on-site inspections by some communes or production teams, the same rice and beans yield several to more than a dozen kilograms more per mu when harvested carefully than when harvested roughly; cutting the stubble to less than an inch can yield more than fifty kilograms of grass per mu; timely and diligent picking of cotton, picking it clean and sorting it out, can also yield ten kilograms more per mu. These are only in terms of harvesting work in the field, and do not include the possibility of increasing production in other links. After the inspection, calculating the total amount that can be increased in production and saved in the whole team, the whole commune, and the whole county is a considerable figure. It is true that "one strand of wool can be felted into a blanket, and one grain of rice can be piled into a mountain." Facts have proved that such an inspection is very necessary, which can not only raise the attention of cadres and the masses to careful harvesting and meticulous threshing, but also find ways to further implement careful harvesting and meticulous threshing.

Harvesting is not "the crops are ripe, just harvest them"; the fact is not that simple. It includes determining the harvest time, preparing tools and techniques, selecting threshing grounds, storage locations and transportation routes, organizing the close cooperation of front and rear labor forces, and a series of rather complex tasks. It includes a series of interconnected links such as harvesting, transportation, threshing, drying, processing, and storage. In each task and each link, there are also some small items and small links, such as placing, bundling, picking up, stacking, drying, grinding, winnowing, sweeping, etc. in the middle of harvesting and threshing. The harvesting process and harvesting techniques of various crops are also different. Each link and each technique must be done meticulously in order to fully realize the requirements of careful harvesting and meticulous threshing; as long as there is a loophole in one small link, it will affect a series of processes, or make the previous links fail, or greatly affect the latter links.

The first link in harvesting is to grasp the maturity period. Harvesting too late will cause it to fall on the ground, or suffer from wind, rain, birds and beasts, and it is not conducive to timely autumn plowing and autumn planting. Harvesting too early, not mature enough, will reduce yield and quality. The most suitable harvesting time for various crops and different varieties of the same crop is different. Generally, crops are "nine mature, ten harvest", which means that harvesting when they are nine mature can guarantee a ten harvest. If you don't start harvesting until "ten mature", you may only get "nine harvest". For crops that are "loose-mouthed," such as buckwheat, etc., they should be harvested at seven or eight mature. Crops that are easy to "burst", such as beans, etc., should also be harvested appropriately early, and it is best to harvest them in the early morning, late evening or cloudy days when it is relatively humid. It is best to harvest crops such as corn with stalks first, and then concentrate them to break the ears and peel them, which can not only clear the stubble early, but also use the "post-ripening effect" to increase yield, and can also harvest carefully and save labor. Cadres at all levels should go to the fields with experienced farmers and technicians to check each plot, determine the harvest date of each plot, mark it on the field, assign it to groups, and set leaders, labor, tools, tasks, time, quality, work points, and rewards. Each group is responsible for each plot from before cutting to after harvesting.

Each item and each link of the harvesting work is controlled by people. To make each item and each process meticulous, it is necessary to do a good job of "people's" work. If you "see things but not people," it is impossible to harvest more "things." The "people's" work in the autumn harvest is first to make everyone understand the great significance of running agriculture and grain in the entire socialist construction, improve everyone's sense of responsibility for careful harvesting and meticulous threshing, and understand the importance and possibility of harvesting more and even more in the harvesting process. The second is to assign everyone to the most suitable position, so that everyone can give full play to their strengths and be familiar with their work, everyone clearly understands what their responsibility is in careful harvesting and meticulous threshing, and everyone knows the close relationship between their work and the previous process and the next process. In this way, each link can be closely connected, help each other, check each other, and promote each other. We must better develop the enthusiasm of some old people and children, and turn the autumn picking team into an inspection team to play a more active role in the autumn harvest. With high enthusiasm and a strong sense of responsibility for everyone, and reasonable organization and clear division of labor for each group, we can launch a high-speed and high-quality competition in autumn harvesting between groups, between each link, and between each person in the same process. In the competition, advanced experts and advanced operating methods will continue to emerge, and the leadership should promptly evaluate, commend, summarize, and promote them. In this way, we can further form a mass movement of increasing production and practicing economy in the autumn harvest that is both vigorous and down-to-earth. Only in this way can we mobilize everyone, everyone strives to harvest more, and everyone plugs loopholes, in order to achieve the goal of careful harvesting and meticulous threshing, and harvesting more and even more.

Careful harvesting and meticulous threshing should be grasped from before the start of the harvest, and should be grasped to the end. We must achieve "ripe without delay, transport without a day, pick up without a night," and we must achieve "every grain returns home, every inch of grass enters the stack, and every cotton boll returns to the granary." We must try to do everything possible from labor organization and tool reform to achieve harvesting, threshing, selling, and warehousing as soon as possible, so as to avoid various losses in the field and in the field. After the crops are brought to the field, we must also make all preparations for preventing wind, rain, and fire. The size of the threshing ground and the size of the stacks should be carefully calculated to strive for rationality; too small is not good, and too large is not good, which will cause waste of manpower and material resources. In the harvesting process, re-harvesting and re-threshing are inevitable, but we must never put our hope on re-harvesting and re-threshing, but strive to harvest and thresh cleanly at one time. In this way, we can reduce the workload of re-harvesting and re-threshing and avoid wasting repeated labor; we can also avoid losses caused by delaying time due to re-harvesting and re-threshing. Re-harvesting and re-threshing should not be ignored after careful harvesting and meticulous threshing. Because the degree of dryness and wetness of the crops and the degree of maturity will not be exactly the same, some harvests (peanuts, sweet potatoes, etc.) are more scattered buried in the ground, coupled with other influences, even if one harvest and threshing is very meticulous, there will still be some seeds, tubers, etc. remaining in the ground or in the straw. Only by first striving to harvest and thresh cleanly at one time, and then paying practical attention to re-harvesting and re-threshing, is it most in line with the requirements of increasing production and practicing economy.

The meticulousness of the autumn harvest is premised on the meticulousness of the work style of leaders at all levels. Meticulously investigate, meticulously study, meticulously prepare, meticulously arrange, meticulously carry out ideological work and organizational work, and the result will inevitably be a meticulous harvest, and it will inevitably be possible to harvest more and harvest even more.

### 多收些，更多收些！

专栏：社论

　　多收些，更多收些！
    今年5月5日，我们发表过一篇社论，题目是：“多种些，更多种些！”多种的目的是多收。在多种的基础上，经过几个月的辛勤管理和抗灾斗争，大部分地区已经到了秋收季节。现在，我们的口号是：多收些，更多收些！
    到了收获季节，还能不能依靠主观努力争取多收更多收呢？完全可能。只要收得适时，收得细致，就能多收。在掌握收获时间、合理组织劳动、改进操作方法、改革收打工具等等方面，都有争取多收更多收的办法。
    劳动农民是十分珍惜自己的劳动果实的，是有不少精收细打的经验的。农谚说：“一粒粮食一滴汗，粒粒粮食血汗换；不费七十二道手，粮食不易吃到口。”今年的秋收在许多地区是同严重的自然灾害作斗争的结果，得来尤其不易。前一个时期，在早秋作物的收获工作中，各地农村人民公社用增产节约的精神对待秋收，一般比往年做得更加精细了。但是，也不可忽视，在不少地方，在大规模的集体生产的新条件下，如何实行精收细打，经验还是不足的。今年秋收作物种得多，时间参差不齐，情况比较复杂。为了及时秋播，对于中秋作物、晚秋作物要力争早收、快收、赶时间、腾茬口，更容易收得不够细致。因此，对秋收决不可放松领导，更不可认为在秋收过程中已经没有多大增产节约的潜力，而放松主观的努力。
    要了解精收细打的潜力有多大，最好在秋收一开始的时候就进行一次现场检查。据一些公社或生产队最近在现场检查，同样的稻子、豆子，收得细致的比收得粗糙的每亩要多收几斤以至十几斤；谷茬割得不过寸，一亩地能多收五十多斤草；棉花适时勤摘，摘净、拣净，一亩地也能多收十来斤。这些只是就地里的收获工作来说，还没有把其它环节增产的可能计算在内。经过检查，把全队、全社、全县可能增产节约的总数计算一下，都是相当大的数字。真是“一根根羊毛擀成毡，一颗颗谷子堆成山”。事实证明，这样的检查，很有必要，既可以提起干部和群众对精收细打的注意，又可以找到进一步实行精收细打的门径。
    收获，并不是“庄稼熟了，收起来就完了”；事实不是这样简单。它包括确定收获时间，准备工具、技术，选定打谷场地、储藏地点和运输路线，组织前方、后方的劳动力密切配合等等一系列相当复杂的工作，它包括收割、运输、脱粒、干燥、加工、储存等等一系列互相衔接的环节。在每项工作中、每个环节上，还有一些小的项目、小的环节，例如在收、打中间就有放、捆、拾、垛、晒、碾、扬、扫等等过程。各种作物的收获过程、收获技术又各不相同。各个环节、各项技术都要做得精细，才能完满地实现精收细打的要求；只要有一个小环节上出了漏洞，就会影响一系列的过程，或者使前几个环节前功尽弃，或者使后几个环节大受影响。
    收获的头一个环节是掌握成熟期。收得太迟会脱落在地里，或者遭受风雨鸟兽之害，并且不利于及时地进行秋耕、秋种。收得太早，成熟不够，会降低产量和质量。各种作物和同一作物的不同品种，最适宜的收割时间各不相同。一般作物是“九成熟，十成收”，也就是说熟到九成的时候就收，才可以保证十成的收获。如果“十成熟”才动手收割，就可能只有
  “九成收”。“口松”的作物，像荞麦等等，七、八成熟就要收。容易“炸裂”的作物，如豆子等等，也要适当早收，而且最好在一早一晚或阴天比较潮湿的时候收。玉米等作物最好先连秆收，然后集中起来掰穗去皮，既可以早腾茬，又可以利用“后熟作用”提高产量，还能收得细致，节省劳力。各级干部要和有经验的农民、技术员一起，到地里去逐块检查，确定每块地的收割日期，标记到田，分工到组，定领导、定劳力、定工具、定任务、定时间、定质量、定工分、定奖励，由各组对每一块地从割前到收后，负责到底。
    收获工作的每个项目、每个环节都是人掌握的，要使每个项目、每个过程都做得细致，就必须做好“人”的工作。如果
  “见物不见人”，那就不可能收到更多的“物”。秋收中的
  “人”的工作，首先是使每个人都了解大办农业、大办粮食在整个社会主义建设中的重大意义，提高每一个人的精收细打的责任心，了解在收获过程中多收更多收的重要性和可能性。其次是把每一个人都分配在最合适的岗位上，使人人能够发挥自己的特长和熟练自己的工作，人人明确地了解自己在精收细打中的责任是什么，人人知道自己的工作同上一道工序、下一道工序的密切关系。这样，各个环节就能够紧密衔接，互相帮助，互相检查，互相促进。要把一些老人和少年儿童的积极性更好地发扬起来，把拾秋组变成检查组，在秋收中发挥更积极的作用。每个人积极性高、责任心强，每个组组织合理、分工明确，就可以在组和组之间、各个环节之间、同一工序的各个人之间，展开秋收高速度、高质量的竞赛。在竞赛中会不断出现先进的能手、先进的操作方法，领导方面要及时地评比、表扬、总结、推广。这样，就可以在秋收中进一步形成一个既轰轰烈烈又踏踏实实的增产节约的群众运动。也只有这样把每个人都发动起来，人人力争多收，个个堵塞漏洞，才能达到精收更精收、多收更多收的目的。
    精收细打，要从开镰前就抓起，一直抓到底。要做到“熟不隔晌，运不隔天，拾不隔夜”，要做到“颗粒还家，寸草入垛，朵絮归仓”。要从劳动组织和工具改革等方面设法，千方百计力求做到随收、随打、随交售、随入仓，以免在地里、场里遭受种种损失。作物登场之后，还要作好防风、防雨、防火的一切准备。打谷场的大小、堆垛的大小，要精细计算，力求合理；太小不好，太大也不好，都会造成人力物力的浪费。在收获过程中，复收复打是不可避免的，但是，决不可把希望放在复收复打上面，而要力求一次收打干净。这样，就可以减少复收复打的工作量，避免多费重复的劳动；还可以避免因复收复打拖延时间而造成损失。在精收细打之后也不可忽视复收复打。因为作物干湿程度、成熟程度总不会完全相同，有些收获物（花生、甘薯等）比较分散地埋在地下，再加上别的影响，一次收、打得即使很精细，也仍然会有一些籽粒、薯块等残留在地里或秸秆里。只有首先力求一次收净打净，然后再切实注意复收复打，才最合乎增产节约的要求。
    秋收的精细，以各级领导干部作风的精细为前提。精细地调查，精细地研究，精细地准备，精细地安排，精细地进行思想工作和组织工作，结果就必然会有精细的收获，必然能做到多收些，更多收些。
