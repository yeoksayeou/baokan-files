            Great Victory
    In the past eleven years, especially since the Great Leap Forward, music art, like other fraternal literatures and arts, has achieved tremendous and exciting accomplishments. Our musical creations embody the combination of consistent political direction and diverse artistic styles. Songs like "People of the World Are of One Heart," "Singing the Motherland," "The Battle Song of the Chinese People's Volunteers," "I Am a Soldier," "I Love My Motherland," "Bayonet Song," "We Must Liberate Taiwan," "Socialism is Good," "The Great Leap Forward Resounds Throughout the Mountains and Rivers," and "The People's Commune is Good," with their lively melodies and vivid imagery, collectively summarized the political emotions of the masses in various periods of struggle. "Great Mao Zedong," "Long Live the People's Leader," "The Sun Rises from the Grassland," "Osmanthus Blossoms Bring Happiness," and many other songs praising the Party and the leader, expressed the deep affection of hundreds of millions of working people of all nationalities for the great Communist Party of China and the great leader. Lyrical and humorous songs such as "Guests from Afar, Please Stay," "Now We Carry Songs in Baskets," "Scenes of Yinchuan," "Tuojiang Ballad," "Festival Evening," "Lovely Yao Mountains," "The Liberated Era," "A Single Glance is Intoxicating," "Liberation Army Comrades, Please Stop," "Song of the Exploration Team," "Old Driver," "The Train Rocks Gently," "Song of the Steelmaker," "New People and New Things Emerge in a New Country," "Aunt Zhang Sings of Harvest," "The Sun Rises from the Mountain," "Joy Comes to Thousands of Villages," "Singing the Erlang Mountain," "By the Little River Outside the Village," "It's Really Fun," "Praise the Three Armies," "The Sergeant's Letter," "Jumping Horse," "Song of the Horse Driver," and "Five Cooks," are filled with the laughter of the new socialist life. These creations not only reflect the appreciation of the working class, peasants, and soldiers for the new life they have created, but also express their ideals for a better future.
    Large-scale works have greatly developed in recent years, especially since the Great Leap Forward in 1958. Thanks to the liberation of thought of composers, the achievements have been remarkable. Many composers have strived to use various forms to reflect China's socialist construction and socialist revolution, as well as revolutionary history, and have achieved rich harvests. These include choral works such as "Heroes Conquer the Dadu River," "Chorus of the Red Army Base Areas," "Long March Chorus," "Immortal Warrior Huang Jiguang," "Flying Tiger Mountain Chorus," "Happiness River Chorus," "People's Commune Chorus," "Thirteen Tombs Reservoir Chorus," "Sanmenxia Chorus," "Long Live the Motherland," "Song of the Hai River," "Huai River Chorus," and "Anti-Imperialist Storm Chorus"; operas such as "Liu Hulan," "Song of the Grassland," "Xiao Erhei's Marriage," "Honghu Red Guards," "Red Sun of Ke Mountain," "Red Glow," "Two Generations," and "Xiang Xiuli"; dance dramas such as "Immortal Warrior," "Five Red Clouds," "Little Knives Society," and "Loulan Girl"; orchestral pieces such as "Ghada Meilin Symphonic Poem," "Overture to the Completion Ceremony of the Thirteen Tombs Reservoir," "People's Heroes Monument Symphonic Poem," "Heroic Island Symphony," "War of Resistance Against Japan Symphony," "Youth Piano Concerto," and suona concertos "Celebrating Victory" and "The Day of Liberation." These works enthusiastically praised the earth-shaking struggles of the Chinese working people under the leadership of the Party to realize their lofty ideals against nature and enemies, and expressed the great revolutionary will and heroic spirit of the Chinese people.
    In addition to these major themes, composers have also written some lyrical music similar to genre paintings, such as the orchestral piece "Spring Festival Suite" and "Song of the Forest"; works based on folk tales and historical stories, such as the dance dramas "Lotus Lantern," "Leifeng Pagoda," and "Fish Beauty," the violin concerto "The Butterfly Lovers," and symphonic poems "Mu Guiying Takes Command" and "Qin Xianglian," etc. In these works, those patriotic heroes and figures who fought against feudal forces in pursuit of a better future were passionately eulogized and colorfully depicted with new perspectives.
    In film music, we once produced "Hassen and Gamilia," "Mysterious Companion," and "Shangrao Concentration Camp," which truly reflected the life of the people. In the past two years, the music for films such as "Song of Youth," "Crossing the Yellow River," "Nie Er," "Inferno in Iron Bars," and "Lin Zexu" has shown significant development and improvement.
    In addition, everyone has also written many instrumental pieces in different forms, which will not be listed here one by one.
    In the past eleven years, our musical creations have presented a colorful scene, which has inspired people's struggles, encouraged people's construction, enriched people's musical life, and become an indispensable force in socialist construction.
    Our musical creations are welcomed by the broad masses of the people because they have a strong revolutionary and contemporary spirit, and have national and mass styles that are loved by the people.
    In the past eleven years, our composers have established a completely new relationship with the masses of the people through continuous ideological transformation. They are no longer observers outside the masses of the people, but members of the masses, living and struggling together with the workers, peasants, and soldiers. Therefore, many musical works are full of the spirit of the times and surging with revolutionary enthusiasm. From our many works, we can see the heroic spirit of the working class, peasants, and soldiers who command the mountains to bow their heads and the rivers to give way, and their communist style of daring to think, daring to speak, and daring to act, their strong revolutionary will to oppose imperialism and defend world peace, and their lofty spirit of selfless devotion to the socialist collective interest. All this concentrates on showing the face of our entire era. After the new heroic figures became the subject of artistic expression, there were also new contents in many lyrical songs, love songs, and humorous songs. They are either directly or indirectly related to combat life, or they express the new morality, new customs, and new artistic tastes that only the liberated people armed with socialist ideology can possess; the sentimental and melancholic melodies that were full of the songs of the past era have been completely replaced by lively, optimistic, and joyful melodies.
    The spirit of the times in the works is not only reflected in modern-themed works, but also in historical-themed and mythological-themed works. This does not mean demanding that the content and thoughts of today's life replace the content and thoughts of the past, but rather treating historical themes and myths with a historical materialist viewpoint, giving the works a clear tendency. Musicians of the new era always have the ideological feelings of the new era. When dealing with historical themes and myths, this ideological feeling will play a significant role. There will be a correct understanding of historical contradictions and conflicts, new feelings in love and hate for the characters, and a new understanding of the role of the masses. In terms of artistic form, there will also be new creations. In this way, the expression in musical works is certainly different from the style of any era. For example, the "Ghada Meilin Symphonic Poem" and the violin concerto "The Butterfly Lovers," the former not only expresses the heroic image of Ghada Meilin, but also expresses a historical conflict, expresses the relationship between heroes and the masses, and the power and struggle of the masses, which are major developments in content and form compared to the original folk songs. The latter clearly expresses the feudal oppression and the struggle against feudalism in content, and more concentratedly expresses the spirit of revolutionary romanticism (although strictly speaking it is still not enough), and in music it is not a repetition of opera music, but borrowed some materials from opera music, and made major new developments in form and style. This treatment is both in line with historical truth and expresses the attitude and feelings of the people today towards these histories and legends, and the art also has a clear style of the times.
    Many of our excellent works reflect to varying degrees the artistic method of combining revolutionary realism and revolutionary romanticism. Therefore, many musical works not only depict our present, but also guide us to yearn for a better tomorrow, not only reveal our reality, but also inspire us to move forward with lofty ideals. We do not advocate objectively reflecting reality only superficially, because that cannot truly reflect reality. In fact, the people are engaged in creative labor under the guidance of the communist ideal, and the people have various rich and beautiful imaginations about the future of the revolution. We say that real life is magnificent precisely because it is a world full of various noble behaviors and various beautiful ideals. Therefore, only the musical art that combines revolutionary realism and revolutionary romanticism can summarize our era and our people through vivid artistic images, truly reflect reality, and promote the progress of real life.
    To build a socialist music cause, we must inherit the excellent heritage of national music. Under the guidance of Comrade Mao Zedong's policy of "letting a hundred flowers bloom, weeding through the old to bring forth the new," we have done a lot of work: In the past eleven years, we have collected tens of thousands of folk songs, folk music, opera music, and many ancient music from various nationalities, including the Uyghur "Twelve Muqams," Dong ethnic group's Grand Song, and Tibet's "Nangma"; through extensive investigation, we have discovered many long-lost qin scores, and through in-depth research, we have turned "Youlan" and "Guangling San" and other qin pieces that have been silent for hundreds or even thousands of years into music that can be played; some of which have become programs loved by the majority of listeners. This provides conditions for studying heritage and inheriting and developing national music traditions. Many excellent folk songs, folk music, operas, and ancient music have been processed to become programs welcomed by the broad masses in concerts and broadcasts; folk singing art has also become an important aspect of our vocal art. Developing traditional forms, developing folk songs, ballad singing, and operas to suit the needs of the people today, and reforming traditional national forms of expression to express new content, is particularly prominent in opera music and ballad singing. Ballad singing has become a vanguard serving politics, and opera music has also gained rich experience in expressing modern life and has made significant achievements. Many dramas such as "Winter Goes, Spring Comes," "Chaoyang Gully" (Henan Opera), "Spark" (Shanghai Opera), "Li Ersao's Remarriage" (Lu Opera), "White Clouds and Red Flag" (Peking Opera), "Jinsha River" (Ping Opera), "Red Glow" (Kun Opera), and "Liu Hulan" (Sichuan Opera) have been warmly welcomed by the people. Opera music workers have created new local operas based on the needs of the people in various places, using the unique folk songs, song and dance music, and ballad singing music of various places, such as Hua Opera, Daqing Opera, Hakka Mountain Song Opera, Ji Opera, Qian Opera, and Qu Opera. At the same time, it has also rejuvenated endangered or extinct opera genres such as Kun Opera, Yiyang Opera, and Liyuan Opera.
    Since the Great Leap Forward, many fraternal ethnic groups have created their own operas and dance dramas based on the song and dance art of their own ethnic groups, such as the Uyghur "Turpan Love Song" (opera), "Loulan Girl" (dance drama), and the Zhuang "Liu Sanjie" (opera). Folk music, which has always performed traditional programs, has also been used to express today's revolutionary struggle. In the new musical creations, the widespread absorption of folk tunes, folk song tunes, and opera music materials is the most common aspect of our inheritance of the national music heritage. In the works produced in recent years, things with foreign tunes and foreign styles have been very rare, and the vast majority of works are always clearly linked to the national music tradition in various ways. Musical heritage was produced in the old era, but there has never been such a large-scale and rapid collection and sorting work as today, which shows that only in the socialist era can the rich musical heritage of all ethnic groups in our country be fully inherited and developed.
    Theoretical criticism work is a means of implementing the Party's direction of serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers and the policy of "letting a hundred flowers bloom, a hundred schools of thought contend," and the development of theoretical criticism work must also allow a hundred schools of thought to contend. The practice in recent years has fully proved that the result of implementing the policy of "letting a hundred schools of thought contend" is not to weaken the Marxist front, but to strengthen the Marxist front; it is not conducive to the spread of poisonous weeds, but conducive to improving the people's ability to identify poisonous weeds, and conducive to weeding out poisonous weeds. We have repelled the attacks of bourgeois rightists, revisionism, and bourgeois academic thoughts, our political consciousness and theoretical level have been greatly improved, and our ranks have also expanded.
    The vigorous development of amateur musical activities of workers, peasants, and soldiers is an important result of implementing the literary and art line of serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers, and an important symbol of the growth of socialist musical art. The people are the creators of history and the creators of culture. However, before liberation, due to political oppression and economic exploitation, the people were deprived of the right to enjoy various cultures. After the national liberation, the people turned themselves over politically and economically, and they are bound to turn themselves over culturally. The new achievements made by amateur musical activities of the masses in our country in the past eleven years are a manifestation of the people being the masters of culture, and also mark a new era in the musical history of our country. Countless heroic figures among the working class and working people have not only become the theme of musical works, but the working people themselves have also become the creators of many heroic odes expressing their lofty aspirations.
    Now, the amateur singing teams and orchestras scattered in the countryside, cities, people's communes, mines, factories, troops, and schools are as numerous as the stars in the summer night. The method of self-writing, self-directing, self-writing, and self-singing has become a very common phenomenon in amateur musical activities of the masses. Many mass-created works such as "We Sing Beside Chairman Mao," "Ants Gnaw Bones," "Long Live the People's Commune," "Wuhan Steel Chorus," "The Spring of San Tiao Shi," and "The Four Sisters and the Five Sisters Are Close Sisters" are already programs familiar to the people of the whole country. These achievements are of course preliminary, but they are already a remarkable start.
    The growth and expansion of the music team with working-class music workers as the backbone is another important symbol of the development of socialist music. Before liberation, the old base areas had already cultivated a group of cadres with revolutionary music work experience who were closely connected with the masses. After liberation, the music cause greatly developed, the need for cadres greatly increased, and the number of new music workers also greatly increased. Many new forces have emerged in all aspects of music creation, performance, and theoretical criticism. Many of their excellent works are widely popular among the masses, and their music performances have become an indispensable part of the people's musical life. In the cultivation of new forces, music academies and performing groups have played an equally important role. In the past eleven years, the number of music academies has greatly increased. Most provinces and autonomous regions have higher music academies or music departments, and many higher music academies have added music middle schools and music primary schools. After successive political struggles, ideological transformations, and teaching reforms, especially after the Party put forward the educational revolution policy of serving proletarian politics and combining education with productive labor in 1958, the various music academies have launched a more in-depth struggle against various bourgeois ideological tendencies, and have greatly reduced the influence of bourgeois educational thoughts and bourgeois music thoughts, and have gradually established a socialist system in the educational system and teaching content, becoming schools for cultivating music cadres serving the proletariat. Many musicians who were deeply influenced by bourgeois music thoughts have also greatly improved their ideological awareness after successive political movements and labor exercises, and have played an active role in the construction of socialist music culture.
    Our achievements fully show that the path pointed out by Comrade Mao Zedong for literature and art to serve the workers, peasants, and soldiers, letting a hundred flowers bloom, a hundred schools of thought contend, and weeding through the old to bring forth the new, is the socialist road, the victorious road, the road full of infinite vitality, and the "most correct, broadest, and most creative road." (Zhou Yang: "The Road of Socialist Literature and Art in Our Country")
      Resolutely Take the Socialist Road
    The practice of many years has made us more and more deeply realize that going deep into the life of mass struggle and combining with the workers, peasants, and soldiers can not only obtain a rich source of creation, but also is a necessary path to thoroughly transform our world outlook. However, it must also be seen that not everyone truly understands this and agrees with this; on this point, there is no lack of ideological struggle. In the past, we have struggled against the reactionary view of "life is everywhere" advocated by Hu Feng, and we have also criticized the erroneous thinking of some people who avoided the life of people's struggle on the pretext of writing the composer's own "true feelings." However, the idea of ​​attempting to break away from the struggle and break away from the masses has not disappeared. After the Great Leap Forward, some people put forward the theory that "some people narrow the meaning of life to only the countryside and factories are life, and forget some new things around them." Of course, it is impossible for us to find any "new things" in this theory, but it is easy to see that it and Hu Feng's old tune of "life is everywhere" are "different songs with the same skill." The essence of this theory is nothing more than an attempt to pull our composers and musicians out of the fiery struggle of workers and peasants, pull them back to the illusory personal fantasies, and live comfortably in their own small world because there are "new things" in it. The so-called "new things" are actually disguised old things. The new things of our era are our rapidly developing socialist construction, our brand-new people's communes, the spiritually uplifted, high-spirited, and high-spirited workers and peasants who actively participate in the technical revolution and cultural revolution, the new intellectuals who go to the countryside and factories to participate in labor exercises and are increasingly becoming laborers, and the rapid growth of the communist ideology of the masses. All of these, can they be imagined without leaving the factories and people's communes, without leaving the workers, peasants, and soldiers? If these are not the most meaningful things in life, not the new things of our era, what else is more meaningful and newer than this?
    It should be admitted that after liberation, especially in the past two years, thanks to everyone going deep into factories, rural areas, and troops under the leadership of the Party, and living and working with workers, peasants, and soldiers, our ideology has been greatly educated and improved, and the meaning of our life has been infinitely expanded, and we have drawn great revolutionary enthusiasm from the life of workers, peasants, and soldiers. "People's Commune Chorus," "Happiness River Chorus," "Thirteen Tombs Reservoir Overture," and many new works praising socialist construction were all produced after going deep into the countryside, factories, and troops. According to some surveys and statistics, our music workers are currently not going to factories, rural areas, and troops too much, but not enough. Reflecting the boiling socialist revolution and socialist construction struggle of workers, peasants, and soldiers in music creation is not already very perfect, but not deep enough; this is precisely because we do not know enough and not deeply enough about the life of workers, peasants, and soldiers. In the future, we can only continue to insist on going deep into factories, mines, people's communes, and troops to live, so that our creations can truthfully reflect the boiling torrent of life of the masses with full emotion.
    Of course, music work also has some of its own characteristics, such as the need for performers to maintain the flexibility of their finger muscles and adhere to regular technical exercises, which must be paid attention to, but this characteristic only illustrates the need to make necessary arrangements for different people separately, and cannot be an excuse for doubting or denying the necessity of music workers going deep into the life of mass struggle and participating in labor exercises.
    Going deep into life must be combined with studying Marxism-Leninism. If we only have life, but do not master Marxism-Leninism through study at the same time, then we cannot get a complete Marxist-Leninist world outlook. The rapid development of socialist construction in our country and the rapid development of musical art have raised many new issues for us in practical work. Whether in music creation, music performance, or music theory, many new issues urgently require us to solve. To solve these problems, in addition to strengthening our artistic cultivation, the more important thing is to improve our Marxist-Leninist ideological level.
    In order to correctly inherit the excellent musical heritage of the past era, we must use the viewpoint of Marxism-Leninism to conduct a comprehensive analysis and criticism of the heritage and tradition. The musical culture developed by our nation in thousands of years of feudal society has both the essence of democracy and revolution, and the dross of feudalism, and in many cases, the essence and dross are always mixed together in different forms.
    While inheriting and developing the excellent tradition of our national music, we must learn from the musical culture of the Western bourgeoisie. When modern revisionists attempt to use the musical heritage of the bourgeoisie, spread the myth that Western classical music art is perfect and unattainable, and use it to promote the negative and reactionary elements in it, in order to poison the minds of the working people, it is of particular importance to criticize and re-evaluate the musical heritage of the Western bourgeoisie. For many years, we have criticized the blind worship of Western bourgeois musical art that exists in the music circles, making everyone recognize the harm of this view, but seriously using the Marxist-Leninist historical materialism viewpoint to conduct in-depth research on the Western classical music heritage has just begun. Music researchers with bourgeois ideas have greatly embellished and distorted Western classical musical art. They have completely deviated from today's era, isolatedly emphasized the progressiveness of the Western classical music heritage, and often one-sidedly emphasized its artistry, but did not conduct a scientific analysis of the ideological content of the works. They cannot see or do not want to see its class and temporal limitations, and believe that the entire Western classical music heritage is beneficial to us; they do not criticize or distinguish between some works that can only play a negative role in the socialist revolution and construction period, and believe that they are our models, and even their aesthetic thoughts (some still have progressive significance today, but some are reactionary) must be fully inherited; and they are taken as the yardstick for measuring our socialist musical works today. This idea can only hinder us from correctly learning from and drawing on Western classical music, can only destroy the proletarian ambition, increase the bourgeois prestige, and play a harmful role in hindering the advancement of socialist musical art. If we do not thoroughly criticize and re-evaluate the Western classical music heritage with the Marxist-Leninist viewpoint, and restore its original appearance, it is easy to fall into the trap of modern revisionism and be poisoned by it.
    Conducting a comprehensive critique of the heritage is an arduous historical task. We must let go and mobilize the masses, let all music workers participate in this work, and repeatedly study and criticize it in a not very short period of time, so that we can achieve a complete victory in this ideological battle. Here we must state that we should not think that because we are criticizing the heritage, we do not need to study it, nor should we think that because we want to study it, we do not need to criticize it. It should be admitted that criticism and learning do not exclude each other. Correct learning is critical learning, and serious criticism requires in-depth study and repeated research.
    The purpose of critically inheriting Chinese and foreign musical heritage lies in innovation and creation. All excellent musical heritage, no matter how high its achievements, is only the sound of the past era. Our era requires the sound that represents this era. Our era is a glorious and splendid era that has never been seen in history, an era in which the revolutionary heroism of the people of the whole country is unprecedentedly elevated, an era in which communist thought is booming, an era in which the world revolutionary situation is unprecedentedly good, and the east wind is constantly overwhelming the west wind. This heroic era requires vivid and new music to express it. Therefore, we must boldly innovate and create on the basis of critically inheriting the tradition. We have made remarkable achievements in innovating our traditional Chinese music forms and in gradually nationalizing foreign music forms, but we are by no means satisfied with the achievements we have made. In order to sing the heroic people of our heroic era more vividly and powerfully, in order to make our musical creations have a more distinct national style and mass style, we must boldly innovate and boldly create while deeply and critically studying Chinese and foreign musical heritage.
    The increasingly widespread participation of the masses in various amateur musical activities is the main feature of the great popularization and great improvement of our socialist musical culture. The large-scale mass music movement is an important part of our socialist musical culture and the solid foundation for the rapid development and improvement of our professional music. Since liberation, especially in the past two years, many excellent and talented worker-peasant composers and performers have constantly emerged from the development of mass musical activities, and have been constantly developed and improved, which shows that the working masses have great creativity. It can be imagined that with the greater popularization of socialist musical art, the musical and cultural level of the workers, peasants, and soldiers will become higher and higher, and they will play an increasingly important role in the development of our socialist musical art. The new musical creative forces that are constantly emerging from the amateur music movement of workers, peasants, and soldiers will increasingly participate in the new musical creative activities and become an important aspect of musical creation.
    Therefore, we must vigorously develop the amateur music movement of the masses and actively give assistance to the mass music movement. In this way, by combining the wisdom of music workers and the broad masses of the people, we will be able to "grow a truly new and great communist art," as Lenin once expected. Thoroughly Eliminate the Ideological Influence of Modern Revisionism
    Our music is developed in struggle. The facts of the past eleven years have fully demonstrated that only by carrying out a resolute and irreconcilable struggle against the reactionary music of imperialism and the bourgeoisie, and against the bourgeois ideas and modern revisionist trends of thought in the music field, can socialist music be smoothly developed. Since liberation, we have carried out a series of struggles against reactionary yellow music and bourgeois ideas in music, especially the anti-Rightist struggle in 1957, which concentrated on criticizing various bourgeois ideas, eliminated obstacles on the road forward, and made socialist music appear in an unprecedentedly prosperous situation of an all-round Great Leap Forward.
    However, although we have achieved a decisive victory on the political and ideological front, the struggle has not ended here. In music field, the struggle between the proletarian and the bourgeois world outlooks, and the struggle between the socialist and capitalist roads, are still continuing in a high and low manner. As long as bourgeois ideas still exist, we will inevitably have to carry out a sharp struggle against this ideology.
    Modern revisionist ideas in music, like other modern revisionist ideas in literature and art, are a reflection of revisionist political and philosophical views in literature and art. Revisionists in music have no new ideas. What they advocate is still bourgeois ideas, so the issues they involve are consistent. For example, what is "supra-class" "human sentiment" is actually the bourgeois theory of human nature; what is "humanitarianism" is actually bourgeois humanitarianism. They raise the banner of "writing the truth" and "realism" to negate the ideological tendency of works; they one-sidedly emphasize artistry and negate music serving politics, negate the guiding role of the world outlook. Because it wears a layer of Marxism-Leninism, it is often easy to confuse people and plays a destructive role that imperialism and reactionaries of various countries cannot play, so it is even more dangerous and must be thoroughly criticized.
    Extremely exaggerating the significance of bourgeois realism and trying to replace proletarian revolutionary realism with it is a reactionary revisionist view in music. People who hold this view always sell their reactionary theory of "writing the truth" under the guise of "realism." They only talk about "realism" but do not want the proletarian revolutionary ideas, and try to obliterate the principled differences between them in order to achieve the goal of replacing revolutionary realism with bourgeois "realism." For example, in the evaluation of Huang Zi, some people put on this guise of "realism" of "writing the truth" and tried every possible means to exaggerate the democratic tendency in Huang Zi's creation, insisting on saying that Huang Zi, a democratic patriotic bourgeois musician, is the banner of our revolutionary music, and depicting the bourgeois direction he represents as the direction of development of our socialist music. This not only blurs the class boundaries and confuses the historical facts, but in essence, it is an attempt to negate proletarian revolutionary realism with bourgeois realism, and to replace the proletarian music direction with the bourgeois music direction.
    Wang Lisan and others also used the crime of "non-realism" to slander Xian Xinghai's symphonic works. They attempted to use "political labeling" and "writing according to political textbooks" to attack the clear political tendency of Xian Xinghai's symphonic creation, and attempted to say that Xian Xinghai's creative method was "vulgar," "mechanical," and "naturalistic," so that they could achieve the sinister goal of completely negating his works and all revolutionary music works. Is this despicable method not the same as Hu Feng and his ilk using "vulgar sociology" and "mechanical materialism" to slander the proletarian literature and art, carrying out a despicable activity with the reactionary goal of the bourgeoisie?
    We proletarians have always respected the progressive tradition of realism music in history. At the same time, we advocate that music should truthfully reflect life. Revolutionary music since Nie Er has been the most truthful and vivid reflection of the broad scenes of the Chinese modern revolutionary struggle and the mental outlook of the revolutionary masses. However, the revisionists are very disgusted with "the thoughts and feelings of the masses" and try their best to reject the combat and political tendency in our revolutionary music.
    Therefore, while advocating "writing the truth," the revisionists are also trying to sell the reactionary idea of "the theory of human nature" in art. The first is to use abstract human sentiment and lyricism to negate the class nature of human feelings, negate the class nature of music as an ideology, and negate the class struggle of ideology. At the same time, they insist that bourgeois feelings are the common human sentiment of all mankind, and even say that it is the most sublime human sentiment, so as to achieve the goal of negating the proletarian thoughts and feelings with bourgeois thoughts and feelings.
    Since human history formed the exploiting class and the exploited class, there has never been a so-called supra-class human sentiment, only the thoughts and feelings that specifically belong to a certain class. The "human sentiment" advocated by modern revisionists is just putting a beautiful coat on the decadent feelings of bourgeois individualism and low-level pornography. Our revolutionary music since Nie Er and Xian Xinghai is not without lyricism, let alone without feelings, but it does not have the decadent feelings and vulgar low-level pornography of the bourgeoisie that chants about the wind and moon and grieves over the scenery, but on the contrary, it expresses the new thoughts and feelings of the most advanced proletariat and the thoughts and feelings of the broad masses of the people who have awakened under the leadership of the proletariat in an extremely vivid and rich form. For us, the thoughts and feelings of the people's masses inspired by the great communist ideal are the newest feelings, the most noble feelings, and the most touching feelings. However, modern revisionists and bourgeois musicians do not like such thoughts and feelings, but they do not dare to openly oppose them, so they only use the pretext of opposing formalism and conceptualization to attack revolutionary music, socialist music, and the music that reflects the new thoughts and new feelings of the proletarian people. What they advocate is not any "supra-class" general human sentiment, but only the decadent feelings of bourgeois individualism.
    People with this kind of thinking will naturally praise "The Melody of Heaven" which promotes bourgeois reformism as a work with revolutionary significance. What it advocates is "serving and sacrificing, giving up oneself for others" is just to make countless sons and daughters of the working people of workers and peasants who are forced to be sold to the bourgeoisie as cattle and horses allow the exploitation and oppression of the bourgeoisie, and "give up oneself for others" with a smile on their faces, "serve and sacrifice" for them, and combine the feudal landlord class and bourgeois ideas. The so-called "Great Harmony and Universal Love, Sharing Heavenly Bliss" is a rotten and stinky idea that is called a noble ideal, confusing it with the essential difference between it and our great communist ideal.
    Our proletarian music not only has a principled difference from bourgeois music in terms of ideological content, but also must have our own style, our own personality, and our own aesthetic standards in art. On the one hand, we fully use the beneficial artistic experience accumulated by our predecessors and the artistic laws formed in practice, but we must also have national, class, and temporal characteristics that are adapted to our content, and we must also form the unique laws of proletarian art in practice. The artistry of our music is rapidly improving in this direction, and we must strive to achieve a higher and more perfect artistry.
    Our struggle with the reactionary music views of modern revisionism is, in the final analysis, a struggle between the socialist and capitalist roads. All the theories of modern revisionism, no matter how they are disguised with the words of Marxism-Leninism, its purpose is ultimately to serve imperialism and the bourgeoisie. It should be seen that modern revisionist reactionary music views play a non-negligible poisonous role on the road of progress of socialist music. Since liberation, especially in the past four or five years, although we have carried out a resolute struggle against these reactionary bourgeois views, we still lack a systematic and concentrated analysis of their reactionary theories, and we lack an in-depth criticism and exposure of their hypocrisy and reactionariness. Therefore, they can still spread harmful influences among some young music workers. We must make a scientific exposition of the proletarian socialist music views in theory, clearly distinguish them from the various views left by the bourgeoisie, and only then can we achieve a complete victory in the struggle against modern revisionism and bourgeois music theory.
        Glorious Task
    Comrades, the current situation is very good. Our various construction undertakings are constantly making new and brilliant achievements under the brilliant light of the general line of socialist construction. The situation of the Great Leap Forward is continuing and developing. The people's communes in urban and rural areas are developing and consolidating day by day. The technical revolution and cultural revolution have generally bloomed with brilliant flowers, and the political consciousness of the broad masses of the people is increasing day by day. The working people have shown unprecedentedly great enthusiasm and creativity for accelerating the construction of socialism and for the future transition to communism with unparalleled ambition. In music, the achievements made by the socialist music cause in the past eleven years have also laid a solid foundation for further achieving greater achievements, making us more confident in continuing to move forward. Our goal is far-reaching and clear, that is, to realize communism. In order to promote the faster realization of this ideal, our task is to create socialist and communist musical art that reflects this heroic era and heroic people, in order to improve the thoughts and feelings and moral qualities of the broad masses of the people, and to encourage them to devote themselves to the realization of our far-reaching ideals; at the same time, we also have the responsibility to support the oppressed nations of Asia, Africa, and Latin America in their struggle for liberation against imperialism, and through music, to inspire their revolutionary enthusiasm against imperialism and unite the people of the world in the united front against imperialism. This task is arduous, but it is also glorious. To complete this glorious task entrusted to us by the Party and the people, we must strive to complete the following specific tasks:
    1. Adhere to the direction of literature and art serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers and the policy of letting a hundred flowers bloom, a hundred schools of thought contend, and weeding through the old to bring forth the new, as instructed by Comrade Mao Zedong, further strengthen the combination of music workers and the workers, peasants, and soldiers, strengthen the Party's leadership over musical art, and carry out an irreconcilable struggle with all bourgeois tendencies that attempt to weaken the Party's leadership over musical art.
    2. Continue to carry out the struggle against bourgeois ideas in the field of musical art in depth, and oppose modern revisionism. Eliminating the ideological influence of the bourgeoisie in the music field is a long-term struggle. Our music workers must carry this struggle through to the end.
    3. Further develop the amateur musical art of the masses. Professional music workers should not only create for the broad masses and perform for the broad masses, but

            巨大的胜利
    十一年来，特别是大跃进以来，和其他的兄弟文艺一样，音乐艺术已经取得了巨大的、令人兴奋的成就。我们的音乐创作体现了政治方向的一致性和艺术风格的  多样性的结合，像《全世界人民心一条》《歌唱祖国》《中国人民志愿军战歌》《我是一个兵》《我爱我的祖 国》《刺刀歌》《一定要解放台湾》《社会主义好》《大跃进歌声震山河》《人民公社好》等歌曲，以明快的音调，鲜明的形象，集中地概括了各个时期人民群众战斗的政治感情；《伟大的毛泽东》《人民领袖万万岁》《草原上升起不落的太阳》《桂花开放幸福来》以及其他许多歌颂党和领袖的歌曲，表达了各民族亿万劳动人民热爱伟大的中国共产党、伟大的领袖的深厚感情；在《远方的客人请你留下来》《如今唱歌用箩装》《银川即景》《沱江谣》《节日的晚上》《可爱的瑶山》《解放了的时代》《望一眼都要心醉》《解放军同志请你停一停》《勘探队之歌》《老司机》《列车在轻轻摇荡》《炼钢手之歌》《新人新事出在新国家》《张大娘唱丰收》《太阳出山》《千村万村喜事来》《歌唱二郎山》《在村外小河旁》《真是乐死人》《赞三军》《上士的信》《跳木马》《赶马人之歌》《五个炊事兵》等等抒情歌曲和诙谐歌曲中，洋溢着社会主义新生活的欢笑。这些创作不仅从各方面反映了工农兵群众对于自己所创造的新生活的赞赏，也表现了他们对于更美好的未来的理想。
    大型作品几年来有了很大的发展，特别是1958年大跃进以来，由于作曲家解放了思想，成绩非常显著。许多作曲家都努力运用各种体裁来反映我国社会主义建设和社会主义革命，以及革命历史，取得了丰富的收获。大合唱如《英雄战胜了大渡河》《红军根据地大合唱》《长征大合唱》《不朽的战士黄继光》《飞虎山大合唱》《幸福河大合唱》《人民公社大合唱》《十三陵水库大合唱》《三门峡大合唱》《祖国万岁》《海河之歌》《淮河大合唱》《反对美帝风暴大合唱》等；歌剧如《刘胡兰》《草原之歌》《小二黑结婚》《洪湖赤卫队》《柯山红日》《红霞》《两代人》《向秀丽》等；舞剧如《不朽的战士》《五朵红云》《小刀会》《蒌拉姑娘》等；管弦乐曲如《戛达梅林交响诗》《十三陵水库落成典礼序曲》《人民英雄纪念碑交响诗》《英雄海岛交响乐》《抗日战争交响乐》《青年钢琴协奏曲》唢呐协奏曲《欢庆胜利》《翻身的日子》等。这些作品以满腔热情歌颂了我国劳动人民在党的领导下为实现崇高的理想，向自然和敌人所进行的翻天覆地的斗争，表现了我国人民伟大的革命意志和英雄气概。
    除了这些重大的题材以外，作曲家还写了一些类似风俗画的抒情音乐，如管弦乐《春节组曲》《山林之歌》；以民间传说及历史故事为题材的作品，如舞剧《宝莲灯》《雷峰塔》《鱼美人》，小提琴协奏曲《梁山伯与祝英台》，交响诗《穆桂英挂帅》《秦香莲》等等。在这些作品中，对于那些爱国主义的英雄人物和为追求美好的未来而和封建势力进行斗争的人物，以新的观点作了热情的歌颂和富于色彩的描绘。
    电影音乐，我们曾经产生了《哈森与加米拉》《神秘的旅伴》《上饶集中营》这些真实反映了人民生活的音乐。近两年来，如《青春之歌》《黄河飞渡》《聂耳》《铁窗烈火》《林则徐》这些影片的音乐，更有了显著的发展和提高。
    此外，大家也还写了许多不同形式的器乐小品，这里就不一一列举了。
    十一年来，我们的音乐创作呈现出万紫千红的局面，它鼓舞着人民斗争、鼓舞着人民建设、丰富着人民的音乐生活，成为社会主义建设不可缺少的力量。
    我们的音乐创作之所以受到广大人民的欢迎，是因为它们具有强烈的革命性和时代精神，具有为人民群众所喜闻乐见的民族风格和群众风格。
    十一年来我们的作曲家经过不断的思想改造，已经和人民群众建立了完全新的关系，他们不再是人民群众之外的旁观者，而是人民群众中的一员，和工农兵劳动人民同生活、同斗争。因此许多音乐作品充满了时代精神，奔腾着汹涌澎湃的革命热情。从我们的许多作品中，可以看出工农兵劳动人民喝令高山低头、河水让路的改造大自然的英雄气概，敢想敢说敢干的共产主义风格，反对帝国主义、保卫世界和平的坚强革命意志，以及为社会主义集体利益奋不顾身的崇高精神。这一切集中地表现了我们整个时代的面貌。新的英雄人物成了艺术表现的主体之后，在许多抒情歌曲、爱情歌曲、诙谐歌曲中，也就有了新的内容。它们或者是和战斗生活有直接的或间接的联系，或者是表现了只有解放了的、为社会主义思想武装起来了的人民才能具有的新的道德、新的风尚和新的艺术趣味；在过去时代的歌曲中所充满着的伤感、忧郁的音调完全被生气勃勃、乐观喜悦的音调所代替。
    作品的时代精神不只是表现在现代题材的作品中，也表现在历史题材和神话传说题材的作品中。这并不是要求以今天的生活内容和思想去代替过去的内容和思想，而是以历史唯物主义的观点来对待历史题材和神话传说，赋予作品以鲜明的倾向性，新时代的音乐家总有新时代的思想感情，在处理历史题材和神话故事的时候，这种思想感情就会起很大的作用。对历史的矛盾冲突会有正确的理解，对人物在爱憎上会有新的感受，对人民群众的作用会有新的认识，在艺术形式上也会有新的创造。这样，表现在音乐作品上当然就有别于任何时代的风格。例如《戛达梅林交响诗》和小提琴协奏曲《梁山伯与祝英台》，前者不只是表现了戛达梅林的英雄形象，而且是表现了一个历史性的冲突，表现了英雄和人民群众的关系和人民群众的力量和斗争，在内容上和形式上都比原来民歌有了重大发展。后者在内容上明显地表现了封建压迫和反封建的斗争，比较集中地表现了革命浪漫主义精神（尽管严格地说还是不够的），在音乐上并不是戏曲音乐的重复，而是从戏曲音乐中借用了某些材料，在形式上和风格上都作了重大的新的发展。这样处理既合乎历史真实，又表现了今天人民对于这些历史和传说的态度和感受，艺术上也有着鲜明的时代风貌。
    我们的许多优秀作品在不同程度上体现了革命的现实主义和革命的浪漫主义相结合的艺术方法。所以，许多音乐作品，不只是描写了我们的今天，而且也引导我们向往着更美好的明天，不只是揭示了我们的现实，而且以崇高的理想鼓舞着我们前进。我们不主张客观主义地仅仅表面地反映现实，因为那样并不能真正反映现实。事实上，人民是在共产主义的理想的指引下从事创造性劳动的，人民对于革命的未来是有着各种丰富的美丽的想像的，我们说现实生活壮丽，正因为它是充满着各种高尚行为、各种美好理想的世界。所以，只有革命的现实主义和革命的浪漫主义相结合的音乐艺术才能通过生动的艺术形象，概括我们的时代和我们的人民，才能真实地反映现实而且推动现实生活前进。
    建设社会主义音乐事业就必须继承民族音乐的优秀遗产，在毛泽东同志的百花齐放、推陈出新方针的指导下，我们做了许多工作：十一年来，我们收集了数以万计的各民族的民歌、民间乐曲、戏曲音乐和许多古代音乐，其中包括维吾尔族的《十二木卡姆》、侗族大歌、西藏的《囊玛》；经过广泛的调查，发现了许多久已失散的琴谱，经过深入地研究，把几百年以至千余年成为绝响的《幽兰》和《广陵散》及其它一些琴曲变成了可以演奏的音乐；其中有的已经成为广大听众所喜爱的节目。为学习遗产和继承与发展民族音乐传统提供了条件。许多优秀的民歌、民间乐曲、戏曲和古代乐曲经过一定的加工成为音乐会和广播节目中受广大群众所欢迎的节目；民间歌唱艺术也已经成为我们声乐艺术的一个重要方面。发展传统形式，发展民歌、曲艺和戏曲等以适合于今天人民的需要，改革民族传统的表现形式来表现新的内容，这在戏曲音乐和曲艺方面特别突出。曲艺已经成了为政治服务的尖兵，戏曲音乐在表现现代生活上也已经取得了丰富的经验，并且作出了显著成绩。《冬去春来》《朝阳沟》（豫剧）《星星之火》（沪剧）《李二嫂改嫁》（吕剧）《白云红旗》（京剧）《金沙江畔》（评剧）《红霞》（昆曲）《刘胡兰》（川剧）等许多剧目受到了人民的热烈欢迎。戏曲音乐工作者根据各地人民生活的需要，运用各地特有的民歌、歌舞音乐、曲艺音乐创造了新的地方戏曲，如华剧、道情剧、客家山歌剧、吉剧、黔剧、曲剧等等。同时还把濒于灭绝或已经灭绝的剧种如昆曲、弋阳腔、梨园戏等恢复了青春。
    许多兄弟民族自大跃进以来，在本民族歌舞艺术的基础上创造了自己的歌剧、舞剧，如维吾尔族的《吐鲁番情歌》（歌剧）、《蒌拉姑娘》（舞剧）和僮族的《刘三姐》（歌剧）等等。一向表演传统节目的民间音乐，也已经用来表现今天的革命斗争。在新的音乐创作中，广泛地吸收民间音调、民歌曲调和戏曲音乐素材，这是我们继承民族音乐遗产的最普遍的一个方面。最近几年来产生的作品中，洋腔洋调的东西已经非常稀少了，绝大多数作品总是以各种方式和民族音乐传统发生着鲜明的联系。音乐遗产是在旧时代产生的，但过去从没有过像今天这样大规模、快速度的收集整理工作，这说明只有在社会主义时代，我国各族人民丰富的音乐遗产才能得到充分的继承和发展。
    理论批评工作是贯彻党的为工农兵服务方向和百花齐放、百家争鸣文艺方针的手段，而理论批评工作的开展也必须百家争鸣。几年来的实践已经充分证明，实行百家争鸣的政策的结果，不是削弱了马克思主义的阵地，而是增强了马克思主义的阵地；不是有利于毒草的传播，而是有利于提高人民识别毒草的能力，有利于把毒草锄掉。我们击退了资产阶级右派分子、修正主义、资产阶级学术思想等的进攻，政治觉悟和理论水平都大大提高了，队伍也扩大了。
    工农兵群众业余音乐活动的蓬勃开展，是贯彻为工农兵服务的文艺路线的重要结果，是社会主义音乐艺术的成长的重要标志。人民群众是历史的创造者，是文化的创造者。但是，在解放以前，由于政治上的压迫和经济上的剥削，人民群众被剥夺了享受各种文化的权利。在全国解放后，人民群众在政治上和经济上翻了身，也必然要在文化上翻身。十一年来，我国群众业余音乐活动所取得的新的成绩，正是人民在文化上做了主人的一种表现，在我国音乐史上也开始了一个新纪元。工人阶级和劳动人民中的无数英雄人物，不仅成了音乐作品所歌颂的主题，劳动人民自己也成为许多表现他们的雄心壮志的英雄颂歌的创作者了。
    现在，散布在农村、城市、人民公社、矿山、工厂、部队和学校的群众业余歌唱队、乐队像夏夜的繁星一样难以数计。自编、自演、自写、自唱的方式，已经成为群众业余音乐活动中非常普遍的现象。《我们在毛主席身边歌唱》、《蚂蚁啃骨头》、《人民公社万岁》、《武钢大合唱》、《三条石的春天》、《四姐五姐本是亲姐妹》等许多群众创作的作品，已经是全国人民所熟知的节目了。这些成就当然是初步的，但已经是不同凡响的开始。
    以工人阶级音乐工作者为骨干的音乐队伍的成长和壮大，是社会主义音乐发展的另一重要标志。解放以前，各个老根据地已经培养出了一批密切联系群众有革命音乐工作经验的干部，解放以后，音乐事业大大发展，对于干部的需要大大增加，新的音乐工作者也大大地增多了。在音乐创作、表演、理论批评等各方面，都涌现了许多新生力量。他们的许多优秀作品在群众中广泛流行，他们的音乐表演成为人民音乐生活中不可少的部分。在新生力量的培养中，音乐院校和表演团体起了同样重大的作用。十一年来，音乐院校在数量上有了很大的增加，大多数省、自治区都有了高等音乐院校或音乐系，许多高等音乐院校都增设了音乐中学和音乐小学。各音乐院校经过历次政治斗争、思想改造和教学改革之后，特别是1958年党提出教育为无产阶级政治服务、教育和生产劳动相结合的教育革命方针以后，更加深入地展开了对各种资产阶级思想倾向的斗争，并且大大缩小了资产阶级教育思想和资产阶级音乐思想的影响，逐步地在教育制度和教学内容上建立起了社会主义的体系，成为培养为无产阶级服务的音乐干部的学校。许多受资产阶级音乐思想影响较深的音乐家，经过历次的政治运动和劳动锻炼，思想觉悟也有很大提高，在社会主义音乐文化的建设中发挥了积极的作用。
    我们的成就充分说明：毛泽东同志指出的文艺为工农兵服务，百花齐放、百家争鸣和推陈出新的道路是社会主义的道路，是胜利的、充满了无穷生命力的道路，是“最正确、最宽广、最富于创造性的道路。”（周扬：《我国社会主义文学艺术的道路》）
      坚决走社会主义的道路
    许多年来的实践，使我们愈来愈深切地体会到，深入群众斗争生活，和工农兵群众相结合，不仅能够取得丰富的创作源泉，而且也是彻底地改造我们的世界观的一条必由之路。但是也必须看到，并不是所有的人都真正理解了这一点，赞成这一点；在这一点上，并不是没有思想斗争的。过去，我们曾经同胡风所宣扬的“到处有生活”的反动观点进行过斗争，也曾经对某些人借口要写作曲家自己的“真情实感”而回避人民斗争生活的错误思想进行过批评。但是，企图脱离斗争、脱离群众的思想并没有就此绝迹。大跃进以后，还有人提出这样的理论，说是“有些人把生活的意义缩小到只有农村、工厂才是生活，而忘了周围一些新事物”。当然，在这种理论中我们绝不可能发现什么“新事物”，倒是很容易就看出它和胡风的那种“到处有生活”的旧调子是“异曲同工”。这种理论的实质，无非是企图把我们的作曲家、音乐家从工人和农民的火热斗争中拉出来，拉回到虚无缥缈的个人幻想中去，并且以这里面有“新事物”而可以心安理得地在自己的小天地中生活下去。所谓“新事物”其实是旧事物的伪装。我们时代的新事物，是我们飞跃发展的社会主义建设，是我们崭新的人民公社，是积极参加技术革命和文化革命的精神振奋、斗志昂扬、意气风发的工农群众，是下乡下厂参加劳动锻炼、日益劳动化的新知识分子，是人民群众共产主义思想的迅速成长。所有这些，离开工厂和人民公社，离开工农兵群众，难道是可以设想的吗？如果说这些都不是生活中最有意义的事物，不是我们时代的新事物，还有什么比这更具有生活的意义、更新的事物呢？
    应该承认，解放以后，特别是近两年来，由于大家在党的领导下，深入到工厂、农村和部队中去，和工农兵一同生活，一同劳动，对我们思想上有很大的教育和提高，而且把我们生活的意义无限地扩大了，从工农兵群众生活中汲取到巨大的革命热情。《人民公社大合唱》《幸福河大合唱》《十三陵水库序曲》以及许多歌颂社会主义建设的新作品，都是深入到农村、工厂和部队之后才产生的。根据一些调查统计，我们音乐工作者目前不是到工厂、农村和部队去得太多，而是去得还不够。在音乐创作中反映工农兵群众沸腾的社会主义革命和社会主义建设斗争不是已经很完美了，而是反映得还不够深刻；这正是由于我们对工农兵群众生活了解还不多、还不深的缘故。今后我们只有继续坚持深入到工厂、矿山、人民公社和部队中去生活，我们的创作才能够感情充沛地真实地反映出群众沸腾的生活激流。
    当然，音乐工作也是有它自己的一些特点的，例如演奏家需要保持手指肌肉的灵活性以及坚持经常的技术锻炼等等，必须加以注意，但是这种特点仅只是说明需要对不同的人分别作必要的安排，而不能成为怀疑或者否定音乐工作者深入群众斗争生活和参加劳动锻炼的必要性的借口。
    深入生活必须和学习马克思列宁主义结合起来。如果我们仅仅只是有了生活，而不同时通过学习来掌握马克思列宁主义，那么我们还是不可能得到完整的马克思列宁主义的世界观。我国社会主义建设迅速发展，音乐艺术随之迅速发展，实际工作向我们提出了许多新的问题，不论在音乐创作上、音乐表演上和音乐理论上都提出了许多新的问题迫切要求我们解决。解决这些问题，除了加强我们的艺术修养以外，更重要的是，要提高我们的马克思列宁主义的思想水平。
    为了正确地继承过去时代的优秀的音乐遗产，就必须用马克思列宁主义的观点，对遗产和传统进行全面的分析和批判。我们民族在几千年封建社会中发展起来的音乐文化，其中既有民主性、革命性的精华，也有封建性的糟粕，而且在许多情况下，精华与糟粕总是以不同的形态杂揉在一起的。
    在继承与发展我国民族音乐优秀传统的同时，我们必须借鉴西洋资产阶级的音乐文化。当现代修正主义者企图利用资产阶级的音乐遗产，散播西欧古典音乐艺术尽善尽美、高不可攀的神话，借以宣扬其中消极的和反动的成分，以毒害劳动人民思想的时候，对西洋资产阶级音乐遗产进行批判和重新估价，具有特别重要的意义。许多年来，我们曾经对音乐界中存在的盲目崇拜西欧资产阶级音乐艺术的思想进行了批判，使大家认清了这种观点的危害性，但是认真地用马克思列宁主义的历史唯物论观点对西欧古典音乐遗产进行深入研究，却是刚刚开始。有着资产阶级思想的音乐研究家们曾经对西欧古典音乐艺术作了极大的粉饰和歪曲。他们完全离开了今天的时代，孤立地强调西欧古典音乐遗产的进步性，并且常常片面地强调它的艺术性，对作品的思想内容却不作科学的分析。他们看不到或者根本不想看到它的阶级的和时代的局限性，认为西欧古典音乐遗产全部都是对我们有益的；对其中一些在社会主义革命和建设时期只能起消极作用的作品，完全不加批判，不加区别地认为是我们的典范，甚至连同他们的美学思想（有的在今天仍有进步意义，有些却是反动的）也要全部继承下来；并且拿来作为衡量今天我们社会主义音乐作品的标尺。这种思想只能妨碍我们正确地向西欧古典音乐学习借鉴，只能灭无产阶级志气，长资产阶级威风，起阻碍社会主义音乐艺术前进的有害作用。如果不以马克思列宁主义观点对西欧古典音乐遗产进行彻底的批判，重新估价，还它本来面目，那就很容易陷入现代修正主义的圈套，受到它的毒害。
    对遗产进行全面批判是一个艰巨的历史任务，必须放手发动群众，让所有的音乐工作者都参加到这个工作中来，在不很短的时期内，反复研究，反复批判，然后才能在这场思想战斗中取得彻底的胜利。这里我们必须说明，不要以为对遗产进行批判，因此就用不着学习了，也不要以为既要学习就不需要批判。应该承认，批判与学习并不互相排斥，正确的学习都是批判的学习，严肃的批判都要求深入地学习和反复研究。
    批判地继承中外音乐遗产，其目的还在于革新和创造。一切优秀的音乐遗产，无论达到了多么高的成就，都只是过去时代的声音。我们的时代要求有代表这个时代的声音。我们的时代是历史上从来没有过的光辉灿烂的时代，是全国人民的革命英雄主义空前高扬的时代，是共产主义思想蓬勃发展的时代，是世界革命形势空前良好、东风不断压倒西风的时代。这英雄的时代，要求用鲜明的崭新的音乐去表现。因此，我们就必须在批判地继承传统的基础上，大胆地革新和创造。我们在革新我国传统音乐形式方面，在运用外来音乐形式使它逐渐民族化方面，都取得了显著的成就，但是我们绝不满足于已经取得的成就。为了更鲜明更有力地歌唱我们英雄时代的英雄人民，为了使我们的音乐创作具有更鲜明的民族风格和群众风格，我们必须在深入地批判地学习中外音乐遗产的同时，更大胆地革新、更大胆地创造。
    人民群众越来越广泛地参加各种业余音乐活动，是我们社会主义音乐文化大普及大提高的主要特征。规模巨大的群众音乐运动，是我们社会主义音乐文化的重要组成部分，是我们的专业音乐得以迅速发展和提高的牢固的基础。解放以来，特别是近两年多来，许多优秀的、有才能的工农作曲家、表演家从群众音乐活动的开展中不断涌现出来，不断地得到发展和提高，就说明了劳动群众有着巨大的创造力。可以设想，随着社会主义音乐艺术的更大的普及，工农兵群众的音乐文化水平将越来越提高，他们将在我们社会主义音乐艺术的发展上起着越来越大的作用。从工农兵群众的业余音乐运动中不断地涌现出来的新生的音乐创作力量，将越来越多地参加到新的音乐创作活动中来成为音乐创作中一个重要方面。
    因此我们必须大力开展群众业余音乐运动，积极地给群众音乐运动以帮助。这样，把音乐工作者和广大群众集体的智慧结合起来，我们就能够像列宁所曾经预期的那样：“一定会成长出真正新的伟大的共产主义艺术”。彻底肃清现代修正主义的思想影响
    我们的音乐是在斗争中发展的。十一年来的事实充分地表明了，只有对帝国主义、资产阶级的反动音乐、对音乐领域里的资产阶级思想和现代修正主义思潮进行坚决的、不调和的斗争，社会主义音乐才能得到顺利的发展。解放以来，我们对反动的黄色音乐，对音乐上的资产阶级思想进行了一系列的斗争，特别是1957年反右派斗争，集中地批判了形形色色的资产阶级思想的观点，扫除了前进道路上的障碍，使社会主义音乐出现了全面大跃进的空前繁荣的局面。
    但是，尽管我们在政治思想战线上取得了决定性的胜利，斗争并没有就此结束。音乐领域内，无产阶级和资产阶级两种世界观的斗争，社会主义和资本主义两条道路的斗争，还是高一阵低一阵地继续着。只要资产阶级思想还存在一天，我们就必然要和这种意识形态进行尖锐的斗争。
    音乐上的现代修正主义思想和其他文艺上的现代修正主义思想一样，是修正主义的政治观点和哲学观点在文艺上的反映。音乐上的修正主义者并没有什么新的思想，他们所宣扬的仍然是资产阶级思想，因此它们所涉及的问题都是一致的。如什么“超阶级的”“人情”，其实就是资产阶级的人性论；什么“人道主义”，其实就是资产阶级的人道主义。打起“写真实”“现实主义”的幌子，来否定作品的思想倾向性；片面强调艺术性，否定音乐为政治服务、否定世界观的指导作用。因为它披有一层马克思列宁主义的外衣，常常容易迷惑人，起着帝国主义和各国反动派所不能起的破坏作用，因此就更具有危险性，所以，必须给予彻底的批判。
    极力夸大资产阶级现实主义的意义，力图用它来代替无产阶级的革命现实主义，这是音乐上的一种反动的修正主义观点。持有这种观点的人，总是在“现实主义”的外衣下，贩卖他们“写真实”的反动的理论。他们只谈“现实主义”而不要无产阶级的革命的思想，企图抹煞它们之间的原则区别，达到用资产阶级的“现实主义”来代替革命的现实主义的目的。譬如在对待黄自的评价问题上，有人就是披起这种“写真实”的“现实主义”的外衣，千方百计地夸大黄自的创作中的民主倾向，把民主的爱国的资产阶级音乐家黄自硬要说成是我国革命音乐的旗帜，把他所代表的资产阶级方向描绘成就是我们社会主义音乐的发展方向。这不仅模糊了阶级界限，混淆了历史事实，实质上是企图以资产阶级现实主义来否定无产阶级革命现实主义，以资产阶级音乐方向来代替无产阶级的音乐方向。
    汪立三等人还用“非现实主义”的罪名来污蔑冼星海的交响乐作品，他们妄图用“插政治标签”和“按照政治教科书来写作”来攻击冼星海的交响乐创作的鲜明的政治倾向性，妄图把冼星海的创作方法说成是“庸俗的”“机械的”和“自然主义”的，然后，便于他们达到全部否定他的作品以及所有革命音乐作品的阴险目的。这种卑鄙手法和胡风之流用“庸俗社会学”“机械唯物论”来毁谤无产阶级的文学艺术，不同样是怀着资产阶级的反动目的而进行的卑劣活动么？
    我们无产阶级从来是尊重历史上现实主义音乐的进步传统的，同时，我们主张音乐要真实地反映生活。自聂耳以来的革命音乐，就是最真实、最生动地反映了中国近代革命斗争广阔的景象，反映了革命群众的精神面貌。然而修正主义者却十分厌恶“群众的思想感情”，极力排斥我们革命音乐中的战斗性和政治倾向。
    所以修正主义者在提倡“写真实”的同时，也就是企图在艺术中贩卖“人性论”的反动思想。首先就是用抽象的人情和抒情来否定人的感情的阶级性，否定作为意识形态的音乐的阶级性，否定意识形态的阶级斗争。同时把资产阶级感情硬说成是全人类共同的人情，而且硬说是最崇高的人情，从而达到用资产阶级思想感情来否定无产阶级思想感情的目的。
    自从人类历史形成了剥削阶级和被剥削阶级以后，从来就没有所谓超阶级的人情，只有具体地属于一定阶级的思想感情。现代修正主义者所宣扬的“人情”，不过是给资产阶级个人主义的颓废感情和低级的色情穿上一件美丽的外衣而已。我们从聂耳、冼星海以来的革命的音乐，并不是没有抒情性，更不是没有感情，只是没有资产阶级那种吟风弄月、对景伤情的颓废感情和庸俗低级的色情，而是相反地以极其鲜明和丰富的形式，表达了最先进的无产阶级的新的思想感情，表达了在无产阶级领导下觉悟起来的广大人民群众的思想感情。对于我们来说，这种为伟大的共产主义理想所鼓舞的人民群众的思想感情，才是最新的感情、最高尚的感情、最动人的感情。但是，现代修正主义者和资产阶级音乐家很不喜欢这样的思想感情，却又不敢公开反对，只有借用反对公式化概念化的幌子来攻击革命的音乐、社会主义的音乐，攻击反映了无产阶级的人民群众的新思想、新感情的音乐。他们所宣扬的也不是什么“超阶级的”一般的人情，而只是资产阶级个人主义的颓废感情。
    有这种思想的人自然会情不自禁地把宣传资产阶级改良主义的《天伦歌》也赞扬为具有革命意义的作品。它所宣扬的“服务牺牲、舍己为人”不过是要无数被迫出卖给资产阶级作牛马的工农劳动人民的儿女听任资产阶级剥削压迫，和颜悦色地“舍己为人”，为他们“牺牲服务”，并且把封建地主阶级和资产阶级思想结合起来的所谓“大同博爱、共享天伦”的腐败得发臭的思想称之为高尚的理想，混淆它和我们伟大的共产主义理想之间的本质区别。
    我们无产阶级的音乐，不仅在思想内容上和资产阶级音乐有着原则的区别，就是在艺术上也必须有我们自己的风格、自己的个性、自己的审美标准。一方面我们充分运用前人积累起来的有益的艺术经验和实践中形成的艺术规律，但也必然要有和我们的内容相适应的民族的、阶级的、时代的特色，而且在实践中也必然要形成无产阶级艺术特有的规律。而我们的音乐的艺术性正是在这个方向上迅速地提高着，而且还要为达到更高更完美的艺术性而努力。
    我们和现代修正主义的反动音乐观点的斗争，归根结蒂是社会主义和资本主义两条道路的斗争。现代修正主义的一切理论，无论怎样用马克思列宁主义的词句来装扮，它的目的终究是为帝国主义、资产阶级服务。应该看到，现代修正主义反动音乐观点，在社会主义音乐的前进道路上都起着不可忽视的毒害作用。解放以来，特别是近四、五年来，我们虽然和这些反动的资产阶级观点进行了坚决斗争，但对它们的反动理论还缺乏系统的集中的剖析，对它们的虚伪性和反动性还缺乏深入的批判和揭露。因此它们还能在一些年轻的音乐工作者中散播有害的影响。我们必须在理论上把无产阶级的社会主义的音乐观点进行科学的阐述，和资产阶级留下的各种观点非常明确地区别开来，对现代修正主义和资产阶级音乐理论的斗争，才能取得彻底的胜利。
        光　荣　的　任　务
    同志们，目前的形势非常好，我国各项建设事业在社会主义建设总路线的光辉照耀下不断地取得新的辉煌成就，大跃进的形势正在持续着和发展着，城乡人民公社日益发展和巩固，技术革命和文化革命普遍开出了灿烂的花朵，广大人民的政治觉悟日益提高。劳动群众以无比的雄心壮志为加速建设社会主义，并为将来向共产主义过渡表现出了空前伟大的积极性和创造性。在音乐上，这十一年来，社会主义音乐事业所取得的成就，也为进一步取得更大的成就打下了坚固的基础，使我们在继续前进的道路上更加满怀信心。我们的目标是远大的，也是明确的，就是要实现共产主义。为了促使这个理想更快地实现，我们的任务就是要创造社会主义的、共产主义的音乐艺术，反映这个英雄时代和英雄人民，以提高广大人民的思想感情和道德品质，鼓舞他们为实现我们远大的理想而献身；同时我们也有责任用音乐支援亚、非、拉丁美洲被压迫民族争取解放，反对帝国主义的斗争，通过音乐，鼓舞他们反对帝国主义的革命热情，把全世界人民团结在反对帝国主义的统一战线中。这个任务是艰巨的，然而也是光荣的。要完成党和人民交给我们的这个光荣任务，我们必须努力完成下面这些具体任务：
    一、坚持毛泽东同志所指示的文艺为工农兵服务的方向和百花齐放、百家争鸣、推陈出新的方针，进一步加强音乐工作者和工农兵群众的结合，加强党对音乐艺术的领导，和一切企图削弱党对音乐艺术的领导的资产阶级倾向进行不调和的斗争。
    二、继续深入地在音乐艺术领域中进行对资产阶级思想的斗争，反对现代修正主义。肃清音乐领域里资产阶级的思想影响，这是一个长期的斗争，我们音乐工作者一定要把这个斗争进行到底。
    三、进一步发展群众业余的音乐艺术，专业音乐工作者不仅应该为广大群众创作，为广大群众表演，在不妨碍生产的原则下还应该帮助他们掌握创作技巧，提高表演水平。辅导群众业余音乐活动，应该是我们每个音乐工作者工作中的一个重要部分。
    四、用马克思列宁主义的历史唯物主义的观点批判地继承我们民族音乐的优秀遗产，批判地借鉴西洋资产阶级的音乐艺术，学习世界革命音乐的先进经验，用创造性的革新精神发展我国民族音乐的优良传统，特别要把广泛联系群众的戏曲音乐推进到更高的水平。
    五、大力发展音乐创作，生产更多更好的作品，进一步提高我们音乐创作和表演的思想水平和艺术水平，为此，我们必须深入地学习马克思列宁主义，学习毛泽东同志著作，同时不断地加强我们的艺术修养，提高艺术技巧。
    同志们，我们这届代表大会是在六十年代的开始，在我国社会主义革命、社会主义建设取得伟大胜利的新形势下召开的。在这次大会上，我们以无限的信心迎接新的形势下党和人民托付给我们的光荣的、艰巨的任务。我们应该遵循党中央和毛泽东同志的指示，深入地学习陆定一同志代表党中央和国务院给文代会的祝词，深入地学习周扬同志的报告，把我们十多年来，特别是大跃进以来的丰富的经验总结起来，把我们社会主义的民族的新音乐艺术发展得更快、更好，完成新的形势向我们提出的新的任务。在音乐战线上，我们要高举毛泽东思想红旗，创造出我国无产阶级的新的音乐，登上比以往任何时代更为伟大的高峰，拿我们创造的社会主义的民族的新音乐和各国人民革命的音乐一同为世界音乐文化开辟一个新纪元。只要我们团结在毛泽东思想的旗帜下，紧紧地依靠党和人民群众，我们的目的就一定能够实现，我们就一定能够胜利！
