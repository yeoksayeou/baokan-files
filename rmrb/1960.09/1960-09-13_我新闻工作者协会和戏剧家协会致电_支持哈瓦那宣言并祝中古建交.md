Xinhua News Agency, 12th -- The All-China Journalists Association today sent a telegram to the Cuban Journalists Association, warmly congratulating the Cuban People's National Congress on its decision to establish diplomatic relations between Cuba and China, and expressing full support for the Havana Declaration.

The telegram from the All-China Journalists Association said: "Chinese journalists are very pleased to learn that the Cuban People's National Congress has decided to sever all relations between Cuba and the Chiang Kai-shek puppet regime and establish diplomatic relations with the People's Republic of China. We would like to express our warm congratulations to you.

"Chinese journalists fully support the Havana Declaration passed by the Cuban People's National Congress and the tenacious struggle of the Cuban people to defend the revolution and get rid of the shackles of imperialism, and express our heartfelt respect to the heroic Cuban people and journalists.

"Chinese journalists are willing to advance side by side with Cuban journalists in the struggle against U.S. imperialism and in defense of world peace."

Xinhua News Agency, 12th -- Tian Han, Chairman of the Chinese Dramatists Association, today sent a telegram to Miss Monal, Director of the Cuban Opera House, representing Chinese drama workers in support of the Cuban people's battle declaration—the Havana Declaration, and expressing great pleasure and warm congratulations on Prime Minister Castro's announcement of the establishment of diplomatic relations between Cuba and China.

Tian Han's telegram said: "We excitedly read the Havana Declaration which firmly opposes imperialism and vows to fight to the end to defend the Cuban revolution. The Chinese people and Chinese drama workers firmly support this fighting declaration. We pay high tribute to the firm will and heroic spirit of the Cuban people and the people of Latin American countries in resolutely defending the Cuban revolution and opposing the struggle against U.S. imperialism. The victory of the Cuban national democratic revolution not only severely hit U.S. imperialism and its lackeys, but also greatly encouraged the revolutionary struggles of the people of Latin America, Asia, and Africa, and made a beneficial contribution to the cause of defending world peace.

"We are very pleased with the decision made at the Cuban People's National Congress presided over by Prime Minister Fidel Castro to establish diplomatic relations with the People's Republic of China and immediately sever all ties with the Chiang Kai-shek puppet regime. We would like to express our warm congratulations to you and, through you, to our friends in the Cuban drama circles. The people of China and Cuba will be more closely united, support each other, and our cause is just, and we will surely win.

"Long live the victory of the Cuban People's Revolution!

"Long live the friendship between the people and dramatists of China and Cuba forged in the struggle against U.S. imperialism and in defense of world peace!"
