Xinhua News Agency, Prague, September 19 - The Government of the Czechoslovak Socialist Republic has decided to temporarily recall personnel from its diplomatic mission in Leopoldville, capital of the Republic of the Congo. The Czechoslovak Government issued a statement on the recent situation in the Republic of the Congo on the 18th.

The statement said that since the Republic of the Congo declared its independence, imperialist countries, especially the United States and Belgium, have been trying to re-enslave the Congolese people, continue to plunder the Congo's natural resources, and once again place the Congo under the yoke of colonialism. The United Nations Command in the Congo has also become a tool to achieve these goals, taking a hostile attitude towards the legitimate government of the Congo and grossly interfering in the Congo's internal affairs. All of this exposes to the people of the world the hostile attitude of imperialist countries, especially the United States, towards those countries that have finally freed themselves from the shackles of colonialism after years of arduous struggle or are still engaged in the struggle for liberation.

The statement, after announcing the Czechoslovak government's decision to temporarily recall the personnel of the Czechoslovak diplomatic mission in Leopoldville, said that the Czechoslovak people are watching with great sympathy the heroic Congolese people's struggle for freedom, complete independence, national unity, and the complete eradication of all forms of colonialism. Based on this position, the Czechoslovak Socialist Republic will be willing to continue to help the Congolese people in this struggle in various ways.

    捷政府就刚果局势发表声明
    谴责美国企图奴役刚果人民
    据新华社布拉格19日电　捷克斯洛伐克社会主义共和国政府已经决定暂时召回驻刚果共和国首都利奥波德维尔的外交使团人员。捷克斯洛伐克政府在18日就刚果共和国最近的局势发表了声明。
    声明说，自从刚果共和国宣布独立以来，帝国主义国家，特别是美国和比利时力图重新奴役刚果人民，继续掠夺刚果的天然资源和再度把刚果置于殖民主义者的桎梏之下。在刚果的联合国军司令部也成了实现这些目的的工具，对刚果的合法政府采取敌视态度，粗暴地干涉刚果的内政。这一切向全世界人民暴露了帝国主义国家，特别是美国对那些经过多年的艰苦斗争终于摆脱殖民主义枷锁或者还在进行解放斗争的国家所采取的敌视态度。
    声明在宣布捷克斯洛伐克政府决定暂时召回捷克斯洛伐克驻利奥波德维尔外交使团人员以后说，捷克斯洛伐克人民怀着极大的同情注视着英勇的刚果人民为争取自由、完全独立、国家的统一以及彻底铲除各种形式的殖民主义而进行的斗争。捷克斯洛伐克社会主义共和国本着这种立场，将愿意继续以各种方式帮助刚果人民的这种斗争。
