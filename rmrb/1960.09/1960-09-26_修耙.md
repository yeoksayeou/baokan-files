齐心为“三秋” (Qi Xin Wei "San Qiu") - Dedicated to the "Three Autumns"

　　Repairing the Harrow
　　One day, Liu Qingguo, Li Changshun, and three other comrades from the woodworking workshop of the Comprehensive Factory of the High-Yield Jiao Center Team of Lugang Commune, Fengqiu County, Henan Province, carried their toolboxes and some parts to the Li Sihe Brigade to repair tools for the "Three Autumns" [autumn harvesting, sowing, and plowing].

　　As they walked, they discussed vigorously developing agriculture and grain production. While walking, someone almost tripped over something on the side of the road. They looked and saw it was a harrow, left at the edge of a radish field. They picked it up and saw it was broken. They put down their toolboxes, one drilling holes, another nailing, and in a short while, they had repaired the harrow.

　　Whose harrow was it? Where should they take it? No one had an idea. Li Changshun was clever and, looking at the direction of the animal hooves, recognized it belonged to the Li Sihe Brigade. They carried it like a treasure towards Li Sihe Village.

　　From afar, they saw the members of the Li Sihe Brigade approaching. After Li Changshun and his comrades explained where the harrow came from, the brigade members were very moved and said, "We were using this yesterday to harrow the radish field, but the rain damaged it, so we temporarily left it by the side of the road, planning to take it to you for repairs. We didn't realize you had already repaired it."

　　修耙
    一天，河南省封丘县鲁岗公社高产角中心队综合厂木工车间刘庆国、李长顺等五位同志，背着工具箱和一些零件，往李四合大队去修理“三秋”工具。
    他们一面走着，一面讨论着大办农业、大办粮食的事。走着走着，谁知路边有个东西，差一点把李长顺同志绊倒，一看，原来是一张耙，在萝卜地头放着。搬起来一看，是一张坏耙。他们把工具箱一放，钻眼的钻眼，钉钉的钉钉，一会儿就把耙修好了。
    是谁家的耙呢？往哪里送？大家没有主张，还是李长顺同志聪明，看了牲口蹄的方向，认出是李四合大队的，几个人像抬着宝贝似地往李四合村走去。
    老远，就看到李四合大队的社员们走来了。当李长顺等同志说明了耙的来历以后，社员们都很感动地说：“这是我们昨天耙萝卜因下雨把耙弄坏了，临时放到路边上，正准备送去请你们修，原来你们已经给修好了。”
