    Xinhua News Agency, 2nd. The Secretariat of the Asia and Pacific Region Peace Liaison Committee today sent a telegram to the mass rally in Havana, supporting the Cuban people's struggle against US imperialist aggression.
    The telegram stated: “The United States shamelessly used the Organization of American States Foreign Ministers' Meeting in an attempt to interfere in Cuba's internal affairs and used threats to force the meeting to pass resolutions aimed at legitimizing imperialist interference in Cuba. We salute the Cuban government and people who have taken a heroic stand. The people of all countries who are fighting for national independence and peace will not tolerate imperialist interference in Cuba. US imperialism, which carries out aggression on every continent and engages in destruction and exploitation everywhere, must not stop the selfless assistance to Cuba from the people of the Asian, Pacific regions and the world who are fighting to defend national independence, national equality and world peace. The Cuban people’s struggle and the solidarity and support of the people of Latin American countries with the people of Asia, Africa, and the world will surely thwart the imperialist conspiracy and enable the Cuban people to decide their own destiny.”
    Xinhua News Agency, 2nd. The Chinese People's Committee for World Peace Defense today sent a telegram to the Cuban Movement for Peace and National Sovereignty, supporting the grand rally held by the Cuban people in Havana against US imperialist aggression.
    In the telegram, the Chinese People’s Committee for World Peace Defense expressed its firm support and high respect to the heroic Cuban people who are fighting against US imperialist aggression and defending national independence.
    The telegram said, “The victory of the Cuban revolution has opened up a new situation for the national democratic movement of the Latin American people and dealt a heavy blow to US imperialism. US imperialism is extremely vicious in its hostility towards the Cuban government and people. It recently used the Organization of American States Foreign Ministers' Meeting to plot collective intervention in Cuba and strengthen its control over Latin American countries, further exposing the aggressive nature and war crimes of US imperialism. The heroic Cuban people are more determined to fight to defend their motherland and oppose US imperialism; the people of Latin American countries are more determined to carry out the movement to support Cuba and oppose US intervention. The great Cuban people are invincible.
    “The Chinese people resolutely support the just struggle of the Cuban people. In the struggle against the common enemy, US imperialism, the 650 million Chinese people will always stand with the Cuban people. We believe that through unyielding struggle, and with the support of socialist countries, Latin American countries, and the people of the world, the Cuban people will surely be able to smash all the aggressive and interventionist conspiracies of US imperialism and move from victory to new and greater victories.”

    亚太和会与我国和大致电
    支持古巴人民反对美国侵略的斗争
    新华社2日讯　亚洲及太平洋区域和平联络委员会秘书处今天致电在哈瓦那举行的群众大会，支持古巴人民反对美帝国主义侵略的斗争。
    电报说：“美国无耻地利用美洲国家组织外长会议企图干涉古巴内政并使用威胁手段来强迫会议通过旨在使帝国主义对古巴的干涉合法化的决议。我们向采取英勇立场的古巴政府和人民致敬。为争取民族独立和和平而斗争的各国人民将不会容忍帝国主义对古巴的干涉。在各个大陆进行侵略并到处进行破坏和剥削活动的美帝国主义，绝不能阻止为保卫民族独立、各国民族平等和世界和平而斗争的亚洲、太平洋区域和全世界人民对古巴的无私援助。古巴人民的斗争以及拉丁美洲各国人民同亚洲、非洲和全世界人民的团结和支援必将挫败帝国主义的阴谋，并使古巴人民得以决定自己的命运。”
    新华社2日讯　中国人民保卫世界和平委员会今天致电古巴争取和平与各国人民主权运动，支持古巴人民在哈瓦那举行的反对美帝国主义侵略的盛大集会。
    中国人民保卫世界和平委员会在电报中向为反对美帝国主义侵略、维护民族独立而斗争的英雄的古巴人民表示坚决的支持和崇高的敬意。
    电报说，“古巴革命的胜利为拉丁美洲人民的民族民主运动开拓了崭新的局面，给美帝国主义以沉重的打击。美帝国主义穷凶极恶地敌视古巴政府和人民，它最近利用美洲国家外长会议，策划对古巴进行集体干涉，并加强对拉丁美洲国家的控制，更进一步暴露了美帝国主义的侵略本性和好战罪行。英雄的古巴人民更坚定地为保卫祖国、反对美帝国主义而战斗；拉丁美洲各国人民更坚定地开展着支援古巴、反对美国干涉的运动。伟大的古巴人民是不可战胜的。
    “中国人民坚决支持古巴人民的正义斗争。在反对共同的敌人美帝国主义的斗争中，六亿五千万中国人民永远站在古巴人民一边。我们相信，古巴人民通过不屈不挠的斗争，并在社会主义国家、拉丁美洲国家和世界各国人民的支援下，一定能够粉碎美帝国主义的一切侵略和干涉阴谋，从胜利走向新的更大的胜利。”
