    Developing Agricultural Science in the Fight Against Drought
    Kang Di
    In March of this year, Shaanxi Province experienced a very severe drought. The broad masses accumulated considerable experience in the fight against the drought, which needs to be summarized and promoted. Many technical problems were discovered that need to be researched and resolved. In response to this situation, the Shaanxi Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party organized a scientific and technological support group for drought resistance, including fifty-five scientific and technical personnel from fourteen units, including universities, scientific research institutions, and industrial departments, to participate in the fight against drought.
    Science always arises from struggle. Social science arises from class struggle, and natural science arises from the struggle for production. In this fight against drought, we used scientific theory to solve practical problems in drought resistance, overcame the drought, and at the same time enriched and developed scientific theory in the fight against drought. In one month, through 195 investigations and visits, 52 special experiments, 122 symposiums and on-site meetings, 38 reports, and three technical training courses, we summarized more than 30 items of mass drought resistance experience, solved 47 prominent technical problems in drought resistance, and reformed 41 tools. We also discovered 69 scientific research topics worth further exploration. A total of 85 written reports or papers were written, totaling more than 300,000 words, resulting in a great harvest of scientific and technological work, summarizing many new experiences, researching many new results, discovering many new scientific research topics, and finding new ways to develop science and technology.
    First, we initially grasped systematic experience in achieving a good harvest without rain. This past winter and spring, the drought was severe, and the soil moisture content was only 7%-8%. Wheat was close to withering, and cotton planting was difficult. In response to this situation: First, we mobilized all water conservancy resources to serve drought resistance. Water is the central issue in drought resistance, and we adopted the principle of "seizing all water, returning every drop to the fields," trying every means to find water sources. Through 84 investigations and visits, we collected a large amount of groundwater hydrological data, mastered the laws of groundwater flow and reserves, and proposed a scientific plan for developing water sources, which made us deeply realize that as long as we can save the water from the sky, develop the water underground, and utilize the water in rivers and reservoirs, we are fully capable of overcoming the drought. Second, we solved the problem of well-drilling methods and water-lifting tools. We summarized the masses' experience in rapid well-drilling, studied technical measures to increase the water content of wells, and created and reformed water-lifting tools. As a result, there were great achievements in water-lifting irrigation in the Baishui People's Commune in Pucheng and the Yongfeng People's Commune in Dali. The high-line water transportation in the Baishui People's Commune in Pucheng is very spectacular, lifting water from the Baishui River, more than 100 meters deep, to the high plateau and sending it to the high-yield area seven miles away. The scale is unprecedented. The group of 210 waterwheels lifting water in eight stages in the Yongfeng People's Commune in Dali is also very large. Third, we studied how to maximize the effect of limited water resources. Therefore, we worked with the masses to conduct research on irrigation technology, proposed a plan for economical water use, and recommended the method of ditching and fine irrigation, which greatly saved water and improved work efficiency. In addition, we also studied changing flood irrigation to ditch irrigation, which can save 50 to 70 cubic meters of water per mu, and changing large ridges to small ridges, which can save 15 to 20 cubic meters of water per mu.
    Secondly, we gained some experience in drought-resistant cultivation techniques. For example, moisture conservation is particularly important and has become a key issue in drought-resistant cultivation. In the 10 cm soil layer, a well-moisture conserved field can store 4 more cubic meters of water per mu than a poorly moisture conserved one. In the past, there were only vague principles for moisture conservation, and the masses' experience in moisture conservation was not well summarized. In this fight against drought, we systematically summarized the theories and methods of moisture conservation in different terrains (mountains, plains), different land types (dry land, paddy fields), different crops (wheat fields, cotton fields), different soil types (loose soil, hard soil), different periods, and different cultivation conditions. This not only promoted the current fight against drought, but also supplemented the deficiencies in the scientific field.
    To do a good job in moisture conservation, it is necessary to be early, fast, good, and skillful. Early means to prepare for drought resistance early. After the summer harvest, immediately plow and harrow, and then harrow and roll to change the old habit of "sunbathing in June, covering in July," reduce soil moisture evaporation, and conserve bottom moisture. Fast and good means that moisture conservation must be done at high speed and with high quality; otherwise, moisture will be lost. The masses say: "It's sticky when hoeing in the morning, dry when hoeing in the afternoon, and slippery when hoeing at noon." Skillful means to reform tools. The drought resistance working group and the masses created many high-efficiency moisture conservation tools. For example, the small nail-toothed harrow created in Xingping improves work efficiency by three to four times compared with the original hoeing tools. Liu Heju's swallow-style double-headed weeding hoe in Pucheng also greatly improves work efficiency. In addition, a lot of work has also been done in fertilization, frost prevention, and pest and disease control.
    Thirdly, some problems with drainage and irrigation machinery and power were solved. At present, various counties have some drainage and irrigation machinery, but many machines have not been installed, or have been installed but not running, or have been running but not repaired due to damage. Some have more than half not working. The drought resistance working group has done a lot of work on machine matching, accessories, use, repair, and technical training for various counties, so that many machines are running and serving drought resistance. In addition to researching, identifying, and summarizing more than 100 tools, 41 tools were also created, which played a certain role in drought resistance at that time.
    In addition to conducting much scientific research in water conservancy, cultivation, and machinery, we also found new scientific research topics that need to be solved urgently in production, and found ways for further exploration of scientific theory. Some schools in the past sat in schools and could not find suitable scientific research topics, but after this contact with production practice, they found many urgent problems that needed to be solved. In addition, it was found in drought resistance that many past scientific theories were divorced from reality. For example, the permanent wilting coefficient of wheat growth was previously thought that when soil moisture drops to 7%-8%, wheat cannot return to a normal state. However, the results of this experiment show that wheat does not wilt when soil moisture reaches 7%-8%, and even after being below 7%-8% for a period of time, it can still return to normal growth when it encounters moisture again. At the same time, some situations were also discovered that are very inspiring for further exploration of scientific theory. For example, the problem of wheat lodging is an urgent problem that needs to be solved at present. In this drought resistance, it was found that when wheat is drought-stricken during the jointing period, the leaves and internodes are shorter. This inspires us that if we irrigate the jointing water later, can we make the leaves and internodes grow shorter, thereby changing the structure of the field and the utilization of light energy? This creates conditions for preventing lodging and proposes new ways to study the problem of lodging from a theoretical point of view.
    Why can scientific theory be enriched and developed in the fight against drought? The main reason is that the combination of six factors has played a promoting role.
    (1) Combining scientific research with technological revolution
    Science serving production is our fundamental policy for developing science and technology. In recent years, we have resolutely implemented the policy of science serving production. Many research topics have been national tasks assigned by leading organs, which have not only promoted the completion of production tasks, but also developed science and technology. However, due to the complexity of agricultural production and the great influence of region and season, especially in the technical innovation and technological revolution movement, the masses are constantly proposing thousands of new scientific research topics that urgently need to be solved quickly. Relying solely on the assignment of research topics from above can no longer meet the needs of the development of the situation. Therefore, only by combining scientific research and technological revolution more closely, directly finding new topics that urgently need to be solved from the forefront of production, and using technological revolution to drive scientific research, can we better achieve science serving production and develop science and technology at high speed. The scientific and technological support group for drought resistance adopted revolutionary measures, went to the forefront of the fight against drought, and plunged into the mass movement of technological revolution, found the main contradictions of the current struggle, and thus was able to carry out a large amount of scientific research in a short period of time and make outstanding achievements.
    (2) Combining topic selection and experimentation with summarization and promotion
    The task of scientific research is to explore the laws of motion of objective things and use these laws to serve socialist construction. There is a process from understanding laws to mastering laws and applying laws. This process can generally be divided into four stages: The first stage is to select research topics, explore research directions, and find ways to solve problems; the second stage is to conduct experimental research, understand the external phenomena and internal connections of the movement of things; the third stage is to summarize the experimental results, from fragmentary to comprehensive, from low-level to high-level, rising to the theoretical level and drawing scientific conclusions; the fourth stage is to impart technology, promote achievements, and apply the scientific research results to production practice. This is the law of development of scientific research work. We must follow this law to carry out research work. However, there can be two routes to applying this law: one is the route of more, faster, better, and more economical, and the other is the route of less, slower, worse, and more expensive. The experience of the scientific and technological support group for drought resistance proves that the simultaneous topic selection, experimentation, summarization, and promotion, combining topic selection and experimentation with summarization and promotion, is a route of more, faster, better, and more economical development of science. In the past, the method of topic selection by leading organs, experimentation by assistants, summarization by senior researchers, and promotion by technical extension personnel was a route of less, slower, worse, and more expensive, because it mechanically separated the complete process of scientific research. In the fight against drought, in order to solve the problem of moisture conservation after rain, tools were immediately created, technologies were tested, experience was summarized, and they were rushed to be made overnight. On-site meetings were immediately held and universally promoted, completing the work that would have taken seven days in one day. This is the result of combining topic selection and experimentation with summarization and promotion using the "simultaneous" method. If topic selection, experimentation, summarization, and promotion are artificially isolated, and many processes such as starting from topic selection, conducting experiments, summarizing discussions, writing papers, and disseminating and promoting are carried out, it will take a long time and be costly, and it will not be able to meet the needs of production development.
    (3) Combining scientific theory with mass experience
    Scientific theory comes from production practice, and is developed and improved in practice. This is the law of the generation and development of theory. The masses have accumulated extremely rich experience in long-term production practice, consciously and unconsciously applying the laws of nature; this experience is an inexhaustible source for developing scientific theory. If we can start from the masses' experience, use scientific theory to summarize the masses' experience, and elevate the masses' experience to scientific theory, making scientific theory and the masses' experience combined, it is possible to greatly shorten our process of understanding the laws of nature and accelerate the progress of scientific research. Therefore, this is a road to develop science and technology more, faster, better, and more economically.
    Another road is: not acknowledging that understanding begins with experience, not acknowledging that the masses' experience can rise to the height of scientific theory, not acknowledging that scientific theory should be combined with the masses' experience; believing that only the research of experts can rise to scientific theory, and only experiments in the laboratory are scientific theory. Using this point of view to guide scientific research will inevitably result in less, slower, worse, and more expensive.
    The drought resistance working group adopted the former road, and conducted many small-scale experiments based on the masses' experience. For example, for the problem of moisture conservation, scientific experiments were conducted based on the masses' experience to find the theoretical basis of the masses' experience, and thus the general law of drought resistance and moisture conservation was obtained, elevating the masses' experience to the theoretical level. If we were to do it ourselves from scratch, we certainly could not have obtained the results in such a short period of time.
    Using scientific theory to summarize the masses' experience has even more important significance for the development of agricultural science. China's agriculture has a long history of development, and there are many advanced experiences in cultivation technology. Especially under the brilliant illumination of the Party's general line for socialist construction, many miracles have occurred in agricultural production, which need to be summarized and improved theoretically. If we combine rich production experience with advanced scientific theory, we will certainly be able to systematically summarize a set of advanced agricultural science with Chinese characteristics, so that China's agricultural science can climb to a new peak.
    (4) Combining the technical team with the mass movement
    The line of combining experts with the masses under the leadership of the Party Committee is the mass line for developing science and technology. The scientific and technological support group for drought resistance deeply realized that the technical team can only exert great power when it is combined with the mass movement. Although our team is not large in number, it includes twenty majors and is basically complete. The tasks are unified, the actions are unified, and according to each person's major, the scope is aligned, responsibilities are divided, and collective research is conducted, solving the problems that urgently need to be solved in production one by one. For example, in water conservancy work, we researched and summarized the experiences in finding water sources, water-lifting tools, economical water use, and irrigation technology, and solved many problems. Just in terms of water-lifting tools and methods, the experiences of machine pumping, hand-cranked waterwheels, foot-operated waterwheels, multi-stage water lifting, Erxian's Method of Water Lifting [a traditional Chinese irrigation method], high-line water transportation, deep-well water lifting, one cable with multiple buckets, and parallel wells for long-distance flow were all studied and summarized one by one. Without a professional team with multi-arms coordination, it would be difficult to do so much work in one month.
    The combination of the technical team with the mass movement requires our scientific research work to be carried out in the manner of a mass movement. Although scientific research institutions and schools also often engage in mass movements for scientific research, they are, after all, mass movements within the technical team, and are not combined with the mass movements of workers and peasants. The combination of the technical team with the mass movement enables scientific research to better implement the policy of serving current production, and has a great effect on sweeping away bourgeois ideas such as science for science's sake, personal interests, and personal fame. It can be seen that the method of combining the technical team with the mass movement is a Marxist-Leninist method for developing science and technology, transforming the thinking of technical personnel, and cultivating technical forces in rural areas.
    (5) Combining single-item experiments with comprehensive research
    The increasing development of production promotes the increasing meticulous division of labor in science. Without a meticulous division of labor in science, it is impossible to study the laws of nature more deeply and thoroughly. However, because natural phenomena are interrelated and mutually restrictive, having only a meticulous division of labor without organic integration cannot deeply detect the full picture of things. The process of crop growth and development naturally integrates various sciences such as soil, fertilizer, water conservancy, and cultivation organically, connecting and influencing each other. Therefore, only through comprehensive research can various complex problems in agricultural production be solved. Comrade Mao Zedong summarized the masses' experience and proposed the "Eight-Character Constitution" for increasing agricultural production, and pointed out that soil is the foundation, water, fertilizer, and seeds are the prerequisites, rational close planting is the center, and protection, management, and labor are the basic guarantees. This points out the direction of comprehensive research for agricultural scientific research.
    Comprehensive research must be based on single-item experiments. Only by clarifying the single factors and the individual and specific laws can comprehensive research be carried out effectively. Therefore, single-item experiments should be based on comprehensive application, and comprehensive application should be based on single-item experiments. Only by combining the two can agricultural scientific research be developed comprehensively and rapidly.
    (6) Combining staying at fixed points for research with mobile work
    Using points to lead the area, and combining points and area, is an important method of leadership work. In recent years, in order to overcome the tendency of agricultural scientific research to be divorced from production, divorced from reality, and divorced from the masses, scientific and technical personnel have stepped out of the gates of scientific research institutions and schools, moved experimental fields to rural areas, stayed at fixed points for a long time, and conducted experiments and summaries with peasants, which has played a great role. However, the experience of one point, although it has a universal aspect, also has its specific aspect. Some of the experiences at the point can be universally promoted, while some are not suitable for application everywhere. Especially with the development of the technological revolution movement, thousands of inventions and creations in the masses need to be identified, and many technical problems in production need to be solved urgently. If we only stay at fixed points for research, we cannot comprehensively solve the more numerous and diverse agricultural science and technology problems in a wider range. Therefore, only by adopting a method that combines long-term staying at fixed points for experiments with short-term patrol work can we promote the experience at the point to the area in a timely and appropriate manner, and bring the problems discovered on the area back to the point for further research. In this way, from point to area, from area to point, repeated cycles, and continuous improvement, we can solve the problems in the current technological revolution more, faster, and better in a larger range in a shorter period of time. The drought resistance scientific and technical working group adopted the method of staying at fixed points for research and mobile work, going deep into the front line of agricultural production, delivering technology to the door, and going wherever there is a problem, spending three, five, or eight days to solve a problem, with very significant results. This fact proves that the method of combining staying at fixed points for research and mobile work can not only overcome the limitations of the point, but also avoid the generality of the area, so that the point and the area are closely combined, so that science and technology can better serve current production.

    在抗旱斗争中发展农业科学
    康迪
    今年3月间，陕西省旱象非常严重，广大群众在抗旱中积累了不少经验，需要总结推广，发现了不少技术问题，需要研究解决。中共陕西省委针对这种情况，组织了支援抗旱科学技术工作组，其中包括高等学校、科学研究机关和产业部门十四个单位，五十五个科学技术人员，参加抗旱斗争。
    科学总是从斗争中产生的。社会科学是从阶级斗争中产生的，自然科学是从生产斗争中产生的。在这场抗旱的斗争中，我们运用科学理论解决了抗旱中的实际问题，战胜了干旱，同时在抗旱斗争中又丰富发展了科学理论。在一个月的时间内，通过一百九十五次调查访问，五十二项专题试验，一百二十二次座谈会和现场会，三十八次报告会和三个技术训练班等活动，总结了群众抗旱经验三十多项，解决抗旱中较突出的技术问题四十七项，改革工具四十一件。还发现了值得进一步探索的科学研究课题六十九项。共写成书面报告或论文八十五份，达三十多万字，获得了科学技术工作的大丰收，总结了许多新经验，研究出许多新成果，发现了许多科学研究新课题，找到了发展科学、技术的新途径。
    首先是初步摸到无雨保丰收的系统经验。去冬今春，旱象严重，土壤含水率仅达7％—8％，小麦接近雕萎，棉花播种困难。针对这种情况，第一、调动了一切水利资源为抗旱服务。水是抗旱的中心问题，我们采取“是水齐抓，滴水归田”的方针，千方百计地寻找水源。通过八十四次调查访问，收集了大量的地下水文资料，掌握了地下水流蕴藏量及其流向的规律，提出了开发水源的科学规划，使我们深刻认识到，只要能把天上的水保存起来，地下的水开发出来，河库里的水利用起来，战胜干旱是完全有把握的。第二、解决凿井方法与提水工具问题。总结了群众的快速凿井经验，研究增大井水含量的技术措施，创造改革提水工具，结果出现了像蒲城白水人民公社和大荔永丰人民公社提水灌溉的巨大成绩。蒲城白水人民公社的高线运水，很为壮观，从一百多米深的白水河里，把水提上高塬，送达七华里远的丰产方，气魄之大，前所罕见。大荔永丰人民公社，二百一十辆水车群，八级提水，规模也很宏大。第三、研究如何使有限的水量，发挥最大的效果。因此就和群众一起进行了灌溉技术的研究，提出经济用水的方案，推荐了开沟细灌的方法，大大地节省了水量，提高了工效。此外还研究了改漫灌为沟灌，每亩可省五十到七十方水，改大畦为小畦每亩可节省十五到二十方水。
    其次是对抗旱的耕作技术，摸出了一些经验。如保墒问题，在抗旱耕作中，就显得特别重要而成为关键性的问题。在十厘米的土层内，每亩保墒好的可比保墒差的多存四方水。过去对保墒只有些空泛的原则，而群众的保墒经验却没有很好地总结。在这次抗旱斗争中，把山地、平地、旱地、水地、麦田、棉田、绵土、?土，不同时期，不同地区，不同耕作条件的保墒理论和方法，做了系统的总结，不但推动了当前的抗旱斗争，而且也补充了科学领域内的缺陷。
    要想把保墒工作做好，必须做到早、快、好、巧。早，就是对抗旱早作准备，夏收之后，立即随耕随耙，随耙随耱，改变过去“六月晒、七月盖”的旧习惯，减少土壤水分蒸发，保存底墒。快和好，即保墒要高速度高质量，否则就要跑墒。群众说：“早晨锄时粘，下午锄时干，中午锄时谄。”巧，就是要进行工具改革，抗旱工作组和群众一道创造了很多高工效的保墒工具。如兴平创造的小钉齿耙，比原锄地工具提高工效三、四倍。蒲城刘合举的燕式双头耘锄，也提高工效很多。此外在施肥、防霜冻、防病虫等方面，也做了不少工作。
    再次，解决了排灌机械和动力的一些问题。目前各县都有了些排灌机械，但很多机器没有安装，或者安装了没有运转，或者运转了因损坏而没有修复，有的有一半以上没有发挥作用。抗旱工作组对各县的机器配套、附件、使用、修理及培训技术力量，做了不少工作，使很多机器转动起来，为抗旱服务。另外除研究、鉴定、总结了一百多项工具以外，还创造四十一件工具，对当时的抗旱起了一定的作用。
    除了在水利、耕作、机械等方面进行了许多科学研究以外，还找到了生产上急待解决的科学研究新课题，为科学理论进一步探讨，寻找了途径。有些学校过去坐在学校里，找不到合适的科学研究题目，而这次和生产实际接触以后，发现许多迫切需要解决的课题。此外在抗旱中发现过去许多科学理论是脱离实际的，如小麦生长的永久雕萎系数，过去都认为当土壤湿度下降到7％—8％时，小麦就不能恢复正常的状态，而这次试验的结果，说明土壤含水率到达7％—8％时，小麦并不雕萎，并且就是在7％—8％以下一个时期，再遇有水分，还能恢复正常的生长。同时还发现一些情况，对科学理论的进一步探讨，有很大的启发。如小麦倒伏问题，这是当前迫切需要解决的问题，在这次抗旱中发现当小麦在拔节时期受旱，叶子和节间都较短，这就启发我们，如果晚灌拔节水，是否可以使叶和节都生得短些，从而改变大田的结构和光能利用的状况，这就为防止倒伏创造了条件，并为从理论上研究倒伏问题，提出了新途径。
    为什么在抗旱斗争中能够丰富和发展科学理论呢？主要是由于六个相结合起了促进作用。
    （一）科学研究与技术革命相结合
    科学为生产服务，是我们发展科学技术的根本方针。几年来，我们坚决贯彻执行了科学为生产服务的方针，许多研究课题，都是领导机关布置下来的国家任务，既推动了生产任务的完成，又发展了科学技术。但是，由于农业生产情况复杂，受地区、季节影响很大，特别是在技术革新与技术革命运动中，群众不断地提出成千上万的科学研究新课题，迫切需要迅速地加以解决，光靠上面布置研究课题，已经不能适应形势发展的需要。因而只有把科学研究和技术革命更紧密地结合起来，直接从生产最前线寻找当前迫切需要解决的新课题，用技术革命带动科学研究，才能更好地做到科学为生产服务，才能高速度地发展科学技术。支援抗旱科学技术工作组采取了革命的措施，走上了抗旱斗争的最前线，投入技术革命的群众运动洪流，找到当前斗争的主要矛盾，因而能在短短的时间，进行大量的科学研究，做出了优异的成绩。
    （二）选题试验与总结推广相结合
    科学研究的任务，在于探讨客观事物的运动规律，并用这些规律来为社会主义建设服务。从认识规律到掌握规律、运用规律，有一个过程。这个过程一般可分为四个阶段：第一阶段，选择研究课题，探索研究方向，寻找解决问题的途径；第二阶段，进行试验研究，认识事物运动的外界现象与内在联系；第三阶段，总结试验结果，使它由片断到全面，由低级到高级，上升到理论水平，得出科学的结论；第四阶段，传授技术，推广成果，把科学研究成果，用于生产实际。这是科学研究工作的发展规律。我们必须遵循这个规律，来开展研究工作。但是运用这个规律可以有两条路线：一条是多快好省的路线，一条是少慢差费的路线。抗旱科学技术工作组的经验证明，边选题、边试验、边总结、边推广，把选题试验与总结推广结合起来，是一条多快好省发展科学的路线，因为它能缩短认识运用规律的过程。而过去由领导机关选题、助理人员试验、高级研究人员总结、技术推广人员推广的作法，是一条少慢差费的路线，因为它机械地割裂了科学研究的完整过程。抗旱斗争中为了解决雨后保墒问题，立即创造工具，试验技术，总结经验，连夜赶制，马上召开现场会议，普遍推广，把七天才能完成的工作，一天就做完。这就是用“边”字的办法，把选题试验与总结推广结合起来的结果。如果人为地把选题、试验、总结、推广孤立起来，从选题开始，进行试验、总结讨论、写成论文、传播推广等许多过程，旷日费时，就无法适应生产发展的需要。
    （三）科学理论与群众经验相结合
    科学理论来自生产实践，又在实践中发展、提高。这是理论产生与发展的规律。群众在长期生产实践中，自觉与不自觉地运用自然规律，积累了极其丰富的经验；这些经验是发展科学理论无穷无尽的泉源。如果我们能从群众经验出发，用科学理论来总结群众经验，把群众经验上升到科学理论，使科学理论与群众经验相结合，就有可能大大缩短我们对自然规律的认识过程，加速科学研究的进度。因此，这是一条多快好省地发展科学技术的道路。
    另一条道路是：不承认认识开始于经验，不承认群众经验能上升到科学理论高度，不承认科学理论应与群众经验相结合；认为只有专家的研究才能上升为科学理论，只有实验室里的实验才是科学理论。用这种观点来指导科学研究，其结果必然是少慢差费。
    抗旱科学技术工作组采取了前一条道路，在群众经验的基础上，进行了许多小型的试验，如对保墒问题，根据群众的经验，进行科学的试验，找出群众经验的理论根据，因而得到抗旱保墒的一般规律，把群众的经验上升到理论高度。如果要我们自己从头来搞，肯定不能在这样短的时间内得出结果来。
    运用科学理论来总结群众经验，对于发展农业科学具有更重要的意义。我国农业有悠久的发展历史，耕作技术方面有许多先进的经验。尤其是在党的社会主义建设总路线的光辉照耀下，农业生产上出现了许多奇迹，需要从理论上加以总结和提高。如果我们把丰富的生产经验同先进的科学理论结合起来，就一定能够系统地总结出一套具有中国特点的先进农业科学，使我国农业科学攀登上一个新的高峰。
    （四）技术队伍与群众运动相结合
    党委领导下的专家与群众相结合的路线，是发展科学技术的群众路线。支援抗旱科学技术工作组深深体会到，技术队伍只有与群众运动相结合，才能发挥巨大的威力。我们这支队伍，人数虽然不多，但包括二十个专业，基本上是配套的，任务统一，行动统一，根据各人的专业，对好口径，分工负责，集体研究，一环套一环地解决生产中迫切需要解决的问题。比如在水利工作方面，我们研究总结了寻找水源、提水工具、经济用水、灌溉技术等各方面的经验，解决不少问题。仅就提水工具与方法来说，对机器抽水、手摇水车、脚踏水车、多级提水、二仙传道、高线  运水、深井提水、一索多斗、并井远流等经验，都逐一作了研究和总结。如果没有一支多兵种的大协作的专业队伍，要在一个月的时间内做出这么多的工作是有困难的。
    技术队伍同群众运动相结合，要求我们的科学研究工作用群众运动的方式来进行。科学研究机关和学校的科学研究，虽然也常搞群众运动，但毕竟是技术队伍内部的群众运动，没有同工人农民的群众运动结合起来，技术队伍同群众运动相结合，使科学研究更好地贯彻为当前生产服务的方针，对扫除为科学而科学，个人兴趣，个人名利等资产阶级思想有很大作用。由此可见，技术队伍与群众运动相结合的方法，是一个发展科学技术，改造技术人员思想，培养农村中的技术力量的马克思列宁主义的方法。
    （五）单项试验与综合研究相结合
    生产日益发展，促使科学分工日益细致。没有科学上的细致分工，就不可能对自然规律研究得更深更透。但是由于自然现象是相互联系，相互制约的，光有细致的分工，没有有机的结合，也不能深刻地窥测事物的全貌。农作物生长发育的过程，很自然地把土壤、肥料、水利、栽培等各种科学，有机地综合在一起，彼此联系，相互影响，因而只有进行综合研究才能解决农业生产上的各种复杂问题。毛泽东同志总结了群众经验，提出了农业增产的“八字宪法”，并且指出以土壤为基础，水、肥、种为前提，合理密植为中心，保、管、工为基本保证。这就给农业科学研究指出了综合研究的方向。
    综合研究必须建立在单项试验的基础之上。只有把单项因素、个别的特殊的规律弄清楚，才能有效地进行综合研究，所以单项试验应以综合应用为前提，综合应用应以单项试验为基础，只有把二者结合起来，才能使农业科学研究得到全面迅速的发展。
    （六）住点研究与流动工作相结合
    以点带面，点面结合，是领导工作的重要方法。几年来，为了克服农业科学研究脱离生产、脱离实际、脱离群众的偏向，科学技术人员走出科学研究机关和学校大门，把试验田搬到农村，长期住点，同农民共同试验、共同总结，起了很大的作用。但是，一个点的经验，虽然具有普遍性的一面，但是也有它特殊性的一面。有的点上的经验能够普遍推广，有些则不宜到处应用。特别是随着技术革命运动的开展，群众中成千上万的发明创造需要鉴定，生产上许多技术问题急待解决，如果光住在点上研究，就无法全面地解决更大范围的种类繁多的农业科学技术问题。因此，只有采取长期住点试验与短期巡回工作相结合的方法，一方面把点上的经验因时因地制宜地推广到面，一方面把面上发现的问题带回点上作进一步研究。如此由点到面，由面到点，反复循环，不断提高，就能在较短的时间内，在较大的范围内，更多更快地解决当前技术革命中的问题。抗旱科学技术工作组，即采取住点研究和流动的方式，深入农业生产前线，送技术上门，哪里有问题，就到哪里去，用三天五天、十天八天的时间，解决一个问题，效果十分显著。这个事实证明，采用住点研究和流动工作相结合的方法，既可以克服点的局限性，又可以避免面的一般性，使点与面紧密结合，使科学技术更好地为当前生产服务。
