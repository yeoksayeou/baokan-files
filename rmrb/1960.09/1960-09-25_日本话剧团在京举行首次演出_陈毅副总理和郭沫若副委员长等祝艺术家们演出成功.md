Xinhua News Agency, September 24th. The artists of the first Japanese Theater Troupe to visit our country gave their first performance at the Capital Theater tonight. With superb skills and vivid imagery, the Japanese artists vividly presented the Japanese people's anti-American, patriotic, and just struggle, as well as the lives of the Japanese people. Each program was met with extremely warm applause from the audience in the capital.

Vice Premier Chen Yi, Vice Chairmen Guo Moruo, Chen Shutong, and Saifuddin attended the performance and, during the intermission, met with the head of the Japanese Theater Troupe, Tomoyoshi Murayama, deputy heads Koreya Senda, Osamu Takizawa, Yasue Yamamoto, and Haruko Sugimura, and other leaders and main actors of the troupe, with whom they had cordial talks.

An opening ceremony was held before the performance.

Yang Hanseng, Vice President of the Chinese People's Association for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries, spoke at the opening. He expressed a warm welcome and congratulations to the Japanese artists on their first performance in China. He said that this visit to China by the Japanese Theater Troupe fully demonstrates that the friendship between the Chinese and Japanese people cannot be undermined by any reactionary forces. In the struggle against our common enemy, US imperialism, our two peoples support each other, and the fighting friendship between our two peoples will become more and more consolidated and developed.

In his speech, Yang Hanseng praised the Japanese theater community for using art to serve the Japanese people's anti-American, patriotic, and just struggle, and for adding a brilliant chapter to the development of the progressive Japanese theater. When talking about the close relationship between Chinese and Japanese theatrical art, Yang Hanseng pointed out that the first performance of the Japanese Theater Troupe in China has written a brilliant new chapter in the history of theatrical exchanges between China and Japan.

Tomoyoshi Murayama, head of the Japanese Theater Troupe, delivered an enthusiastic speech. When talking about the theater troupe's visit to China, he said that the Japanese theatrical artists will use their performances to introduce to the Chinese audience the Japanese people's struggle for independence and against US imperialism, their strong desire to unite closely with peace-loving countries, and their determination to fight no matter what hardships they may face. He said that in our performances, we also ask everyone to understand how we have gained courage from the warm support of the Chinese people.

Chairman Murayama Tomoyoshi said that the Japanese Theater Troupe will contribute its strength to opposing US imperialism and the hostile policies of the Japanese government, to striving for peace in Asia and the world, and to enhancing the close unity between the people of Japan and China.

Tonight, the Japanese artists performed the Japanese folk story play "Yuzuru," a famous modern play that has been circulating in Japan. The play uses the experiences of a kind-hearted couple to praise people's longing for a better life and condemn the evil forces that disrupt peaceful life.

The Japanese artists also performed three recitation plays: "Miike Coal Mine," "Okinawa," and "Record of the Struggle Against the US-Japan 'Security Treaty.'" These short plays, full of fighting atmosphere, vividly reported the heroic struggles of the Japanese people and Japanese workers against US imperialism, Japanese militarism, and Japanese monopoly capital.

The last program performed by the Japanese artists was the recitation play "Record of the Struggle Against the US-Japan 'Security Treaty.'" Before the end of the performance, the masses who were marching and demonstrating on the stage, holding high signs, walked off the stage in two lines and circled the theater. At this time, all the audience stood up and applauded warmly, and shook hands with them cordially. The common struggle against US imperialism closely linked the Japanese artists with the audience in the capital.

Vice Premier Chen Yi, Vice Chairman Guo Moruo and others went on stage to congratulate the Japanese artists on their successful performance.

Also present at the performance were Liao Chengzhi, Liu Ningyi, Zhang Hanfu, Chu Tunan, Ding Xilin, Xia Yan, Zhang Zhixiang, Qu Wu, Xu Guangxiao, Tian Han, Ouyang Yuqian, Mei Lanfang and other responsible persons of relevant departments and famous figures in the capital's literary and art circles.
