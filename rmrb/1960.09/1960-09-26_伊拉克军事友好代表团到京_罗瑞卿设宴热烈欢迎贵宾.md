Members of the song and dance troupes of the Army, Navy, and Air Force of the Chinese People's Liberation Army presented flowers to the distinguished guests.

Colonel Xu Yimin, military attaché of our embassy in Iraq, also welcomed them at the airport.

He Ying, Director of the West Asia and Africa Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and Luo Jun, Vice President of the Sino-Iraqi Friendship Association, also welcomed them at the airport.

Fadil, the Ambassador of the Republic of Iraq to our country, and military attachés of various countries' embassies in China also welcomed them at the airport.

Xinhua News Agency, September 25th. General Luo Ruiqing, Chief of the General Staff of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, held a banquet in the Xinjiang Hall of the Great Hall of the People tonight to warmly welcome all members of the Iraqi Military Friendship Delegation, headed by Brigadier General Mahmoud Abdul Razzaq, who are visiting our country.

General Luo Ruiqing, on behalf of the Ministry of National Defense and all commanders and fighters of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, extended a warm welcome to all distinguished guests of the Iraqi Military Friendship Delegation headed by Brigadier General Razzaq.

General Luo Ruiqing said that the Iraqi people, in order to oppose the dark rule of imperialism and its running dogs, waged a long and heroic struggle and finally overthrew the reactionary Faisal dynasty and established the Republic of Iraq. This glorious victory of the Iraqi people not only enabled Iraq to embark on the road of independent development, but also caused the "Baghdad Pact Group" controlled by US and British imperialism to disintegrate, and severely hit the US imperialist aggression schemes and war plans in the Middle East.

General Luo Ruiqing said that the Chinese people and the Chinese People's Liberation Army greatly admire the heroic struggle of the Iraqi people and are overjoyed by your victory. We firmly believe that the Iraqi people and army, with a glorious revolutionary tradition, will continue to make new contributions to the glorious cause of maintaining national independence and defending world peace.

General Luo Ruiqing said that the Chinese people love peace. Our country has always advocated peaceful coexistence among countries with different social systems, is willing to establish friendly relations with all countries on the basis of equality and mutual benefit, and has signed treaties of friendship and non-aggression or treaties of peace and friendship with many of our neighboring countries; we give the greatest sympathy and support to all countries and peoples who are striving for national independence and freedom from colonial oppression. However, US imperialism has always been pursuing its war policy and aggression policy, has been occupying our territory of Taiwan, and constantly carries out provocations in our territorial waters and airspace, and rudely interferes in our internal affairs. For countries that have already gained independence, US imperialism interferes in many ways, threatens war, and takes vicious means to carry out subversive conspiracies. Therefore, we must be vigilant against imperialism, especially US imperialism.

General Luo Ruiqing finally raised his glass to the deep friendship between the peoples and armies of China and Iraq.

Brigadier General Razzaq spoke at the banquet. He said that China and Arab countries, especially Iraq, have had thousands of years of economic and cultural ties. The friendship between the Chinese and Iraqi peoples is built on the struggle against imperialism. He said that China and Iraq have both suffered from imperialist aggression, and they are sister countries sharing weal and woe. Therefore, our two countries understand each other very well. We have always held a loving feeling for the great Chinese people.

After narrating the history of the Iraqi people's struggle against imperialism, Brigadier General Razzaq said that Iraq is determined to make itself a sovereign country. Neither Iraq nor China can allow any foreign interference in their internal affairs.

When talking about the achievements of the Chinese people, Brigadier General Razzaq said that China has become a beacon for the people of all countries to strive for independence and freedom, and she enjoys a high reputation in international affairs.

Among those who attended the banquet tonight were General Xiao Hua, General Zhang Aiping, Lieutenant General Xiao Xiangrong, Vice Admiral Zhao Qimin, Lieutenant General Chang Qiankun, Lieutenant General Liu Zhong, Lieutenant General Han Wei, Lieutenant General Liu Jin Xuan, Major General Zhu Guang, Major General Lin Bin, Major General Sun Chaoqun and other senior generals of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, and Colonel Xu Yimin, military attaché of our embassy in Iraq.

Also present at the banquet were He Ying, Director of the West Asia and Africa Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and Luo Jun, Vice President of the Sino-Iraqi Friendship Association.

Fadil, the Ambassador of the Republic of Iraq to our country, and military attachés of various countries' embassies in China also attended the banquet.

    罗瑞卿大将代表国防部和中国人民解放军全体指战员，向以拉扎克准将为首的伊拉克军事友好代表团全体贵宾，表示热烈欢迎。
    罗瑞卿大将说，伊拉克人民为了反对帝国主义及其走狗的黑暗统治，进行了长期英勇的斗争，终于推翻了反动的费萨尔王朝，建立了伊拉克共和国。伊拉克人民的这一光荣胜利，不仅使伊拉克从此走上了独立发展的道路，并且使美英帝国主义所控制的“巴格达条约集团”陷于瓦解，使美帝国主义在中东的侵略阴谋和战争计划，受到了沉重的打击。
    罗瑞卿大将说，中国人民和中国人民解放军，对于伊拉克人民的英勇斗争，非常钦佩，并且为你们的胜利而感到欢欣鼓舞。我们深信，有着光荣革命传统的伊拉克人民和军队，对维护民族独立和保卫世界和平的光荣事业，必将继续作出新的贡献。
    罗瑞卿大将说，中国人民是爱好和平的，我国一贯主张不同社会制度国家和平共处，愿意在平等互利的基础上，同一切国家建立友好关系，并且同我们许多邻国订立了友好互不侵犯条约或和平友好条约；对于一切为争取民族独立、摆脱殖民主义压迫的国家和人民，给以最大的同情和支持。但是，美帝国主义在始终奉行它的战争政策和侵略政策，一直侵占着我国的领土台湾，不断地在我国领海、领空进行挑衅，蛮横地干涉我国内政。对于已经获得独立的国家，美帝国主义则多方进行干涉，进行战争威胁，并且采取恶毒的手段，大搞颠覆阴谋活动。因此，对于帝国主义，特别是对于美帝国主义，我们不能不提高警惕。
    罗瑞卿大将最后举杯为中伊两国人民和军队之间的深厚友谊干杯。
    拉扎克准将在宴会上讲话。他说，中国和阿拉伯国家，特别是伊拉克，有着几千年的经济和文化上的联系。中国和伊拉克人民的友谊又是建筑在反对帝国主义的斗争上的。他说，中国和伊拉克都曾遭受帝国主义的侵略，他们是患难相共的姊妹国家。因此，我们两国相互之间很了解。我们对伟大的中国人民一贯抱着热爱心情。
    拉扎克准将在叙述了伊拉克人民反对帝国主义的斗争历史后说，伊拉克决心使自己成为有主权的国家。伊拉克和中国都决不能允许任何外国干涉他们的内政。
    拉扎克准将谈到中国人民的成就时说，中国已成为各国人民争取独立、自由的灯塔，她在国际事务中享有很高的信誉。
    出席今晚宴会的，有萧华上将、张爱萍上将、萧向荣中将、赵启民海军中将、常乾坤空军中将、刘忠中将、韩伟中将、刘金轩中将、朱光少将、林彬少将、孙超群少将、贾若瑜少将等中国人民解放军高级将领和我国驻伊拉克大使馆武官徐毅民上校。
