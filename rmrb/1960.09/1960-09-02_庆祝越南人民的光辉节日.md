    Celebrating the Glorious Festival of the Vietnamese People
    Yang Xiufeng, President of the China-Vietnam Friendship Association
    September 2nd this year marks the 15th anniversary of the founding of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. The Chinese people, with boundless excitement, join the fraternal Vietnamese people in celebrating this glorious festival. On this joyous occasion, we feel particularly delighted and encouraged as we review the great victories achieved by the Vietnamese people in their long revolutionary struggle in the past, and the series of achievements made in the socialist revolution and construction in North Vietnam after its liberation.
    Ever since French imperialism occupied Vietnam, the Vietnamese people have continuously risen up to resist the oppression and enslavement of the French colonialists. By 1930, with the establishment of the proletarian party in Vietnam, the Vietnamese revolution, under the leadership of the proletariat, began to carry out a long and heroic struggle against French and Japanese imperialism, holding high the banner of national democratic revolution. The revolutionary forces of the Vietnamese people have been tempered in the flames of the struggle against imperialism and have continuously grown stronger. On August 19, 1945, under the leadership of their party and President Ho Chi Minh, the Vietnamese people launched the August Revolution general uprising, shattered the shackles of colonialism that had lasted for nearly a century, overthrew the feudal rule that had lasted for thousands of years, and victoriously established the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. This was the first time in the Southeast Asian region that a proletarian party led the people to seize power through armed uprising and achieve national independence. This victory has great international significance.
    The imperialists were unwilling to accept this great victory of the Vietnamese people. Soon after the birth of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, the French colonialists, with the support of American and British imperialism, launched a barbaric war of aggression in an attempt to re-enslave the Vietnamese people. Under the leadership of their party and President Ho Chi Minh, the Vietnamese people bravely and stubbornly waged a long nine-year war of resistance, inflicting extremely heavy blows on the French aggressors and shattering the plot of American imperialist interventionists to expand the Indochina war. Finally, in July 1954, with the firm support of the Soviet Union, China, other socialist countries, and peace-loving people all over the world, the Geneva Accords were reached, restoring peace in Indochina. This victory of the Vietnamese people made a significant contribution to the cause of peace in Asia and the world.
    After the restoration of peace, the people of North Vietnam, under the leadership of their party and President Ho Chi Minh, actively carried out socialist transformation and socialist construction on the basis of completing land reform and restoring the national economy, and achieved a series of major achievements. In terms of socialist transformation, by the beginning of June this year, the number of peasant households in North Vietnam that had joined production cooperatives accounted for 55% of the total number of peasant households; the socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce had been basically completed; and 70% of handicraftsmen had joined various cooperative organizations. The original plan to basically complete socialist transformation this year has been achieved ahead of schedule in some areas. This decisive victory achieved by the Vietnamese people in carrying out socialist revolution in the North will surely accelerate the pace of advancement on the socialist road.
    After the restoration of peace, the Democratic Republic of Vietnam has increased production in agriculture year by year. In 1959, the output of rice reached 5,194,000 tons, more than double the highest pre-war output in 1939. At the same time, in terms of yield per unit area and output per capita, it exceeded rice-producing countries such as Burma and Thailand, ranking first in Southeast Asia. Significant achievements have also been made in industrial construction. In 1955, the total output value of industry and handicrafts in North Vietnam accounted for only 16.9% of the total output value of industry and agriculture; by 1959, it had increased to 37.1%. On the basis of the rapid development of industrial and agricultural production, the economic and cultural life of the people in North Vietnam has also been continuously improved and enhanced. In five years, the national income per capita has increased by 90%, and the wages of workers and the purchasing power of farmers have increased significantly. Due to the Labor Party's great attention to ideological and cultural work, the people's political awareness and cultural level have been greatly improved. Now, illiteracy has been basically eliminated in the North; the number of primary and secondary school students has increased fivefold compared with the highest year in the entire Indochina under French rule, and the number of university students has increased thirteenfold. These achievements are changing the face of North Vietnam day by day. Now, the people of North Vietnam are waging a victorious struggle to complete the socialist transformation and the three-year plan (1958-1960) for the development of the economy and culture.
    At the same time, in South Vietnam, the Ngo Dinh Diem clique, manipulated by American imperialism, is doing everything possible to undermine the Geneva Accords, attempting to divide Vietnam for a long time and turn South Vietnam into a colony and military base of American imperialism. The Ngo Dinh Diem puppet regime, manipulated by American imperialism, has established a fascist reign of terror in South Vietnam, suppressing patriots and persecuting former resistance personnel. The so-called American "aid" has led to the bankruptcy of the Southern economy, the unemployment of more than half of the workers, and the closure of thousands of factories and enterprises. Therefore, while leading the people of the North to accelerate socialist construction, the Vietnamese Labor Party is also conducting an unremitting struggle to achieve the peaceful reunification of the motherland. The people of South Vietnam, carrying forward the glorious tradition of unity and heroic struggle, are holding high the banner of peace, unity, independence, and democracy, and are waging an unyielding struggle against the reactionary rulers.
    China and Vietnam are neighboring countries as closely related as lips and teeth, and are brothers sharing weal and woe. There is a long-standing traditional friendship between our two peoples. In the struggle against imperialist aggression and for their respective national independence and freedom over the past century, our two peoples have always sympathized with and supported each other. Since the founding of the People's Republic of China, even closer relations of mutual assistance and cooperation have been established between the two parties, the two governments, and the two peoples. Whether in the common struggle against imperialist aggression and in defense of world peace, or in the socialist construction of the two countries, the fraternal mutual assistance and cooperation between our two peoples are being consolidated and developed. The friendship between our two countries is based on Marxism-Leninism and proletarian internationalism, and is unbreakable. In recent years, our mutual support in socialist construction has been continuously strengthened, and friendly exchanges between the governments and peoples of our two countries have become increasingly frequent. Last year, President Ho Chi Minh, beloved by the Chinese people, personally led a Vietnamese party and government delegation to participate in the celebration of the 10th anniversary of the founding of our country. This was a great encouragement to the Chinese people who are striving to accelerate the construction of socialism. In May of this year, Premier Zhou Enlai of our country visited the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, and the leaders of the Chinese and Vietnamese parties and governments held talks, further strengthening the unbreakable unity and friendship between the two countries and the two parties. Our mutual assistance and cooperation not only promote the common upsurge of the economies and cultures of the two countries, but also contribute to the maintenance of peace in Asia and the world.
    Today, as the Chinese and Vietnamese peoples jointly celebrate the 15th anniversary of the founding of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, I would like to extend my heartfelt congratulations to the fraternal Vietnamese people:
    May the unbreakable fraternal friendship between the Chinese and Vietnamese peoples last forever!
    I wish the Vietnamese people new and great victories in the cause of socialist construction, in the unification of the motherland, and in the just struggle against American imperialism, under the wise leadership of the Vietnamese Labor Party and President Ho Chi Minh!

### 庆祝越南人民的光辉节日

    庆祝越南人民的光辉节日
    中国越南友好协会会长　杨秀峰
    今年9月2日，是越南民主共和国成立十五周年。中国人民以无限兴奋的心情，和兄弟的越南人民共同欢庆这个光辉的节日。在这个喜庆的日子里，我们回顾越南人民过去进行长期革命斗争所取得的伟大胜利，以及越南北方解放后在社会主义革命和建设事业中所取得的一系列成就，特别感到欢欣鼓舞。
    自从法帝国主义侵占越南以后，越南人民就不断起来反抗法国殖民主义者的压迫和奴役。到1930年越南的无产阶级政党成立，越南革命就开始在无产阶级的领导下，高举着民族民主革命的旗帜，进行了长期、英勇的反对法、日帝国主义的斗争。越南人民的革命力量，在反对帝国主义斗争的烈火中获得锻炼，不断地成长壮大起来。1945年8月19日，越南人民在自己的党和胡志明主席的领导下，举行了八月革命总起义，粉碎了近百年的殖民主义枷锁，推翻了成千年的封建统治，胜利地建立了越南民主共和国。这是东南亚地区殖民地第一次由无产阶级政党领导人民，经过武装起义，夺得政权，实现了民族独立。这一胜利具有巨大的国际意义。
    帝国主义对于越南人民的这一伟大胜利是不甘心的。越南民主共和国刚刚诞生不久，法国殖民者就在美、英帝国主义的支持下，发动了野蛮的侵略战争，企图重新奴役越南人民。越南人民在自己的党和胡志明主席的领导下，英勇顽强地进行了九年的长期抗战，给予法国侵略者以极其沉重的打击，并且粉碎了美帝国主义干涉者企图扩大印度支那战争的阴谋。终于在1954年7月，在苏联、中国和其它社会主义国家以及全世界爱好和平人民的坚决支持下，达成了日内瓦协议，恢复了印度支那的和平。越南人民的这一胜利，对亚洲和世界的和平事业作出了重大的贡献。
    和平恢复后，越南北方人民在自己的党和胡志明主席的领导下，在完成土地改革和恢复国民经济的基础上，积极进行社会主义改造和社会主义建设，取得了一系列的重大成就。在社会主义改造方面，到今年6月初，越南北方加入生产合作社的农户，已占农户总数的55％；对资本主义工商业的社会主义改造已经基本完成；手工业者已有70％参加各种合作组织。今年基本完成社会主义改造的原定计划，有一部分已提前实现。越南人民在北方进行社会主义革命所取得的这一具有决定性意义的胜利，必将加快在社会主义道路上迈进的步伐。
    和平恢复后，越南民主共和国在农业方面年年提高生产。1959年稻谷产量，已经达到五百一十九万四千吨，比战前产量最高的1939年增加一倍多。同时，在单位面积产量和按人口平均计算产量方面，超过了缅甸、泰国等产米国家，占东南亚的第一位。在工业建设方面，成绩也十分显著。1955年，越南北方的工业、手工业总产值，仅占工农业总产值的16.9％；1959年，已经增长到37.1％。在工农业生产迅速发展的基础上，越南北方人民的经济文化生活也不断改善和提高。五年间，国民收入按人口平均计算增加了90％，职工工资和农民的购买力，都有显著增长。由于劳动党十分注意思想工作和文化工作，人民的政治觉悟和文化水平有了很大提高。现在，北方已基本上扫清了文盲；中小学生人数比法国统治时期全印度支那最高年份增加了五倍，大学生人数增加了十三倍。这些成就，使越南北方的面貌日新月异地改变着。现在，越南北方人民正在为完成社会主义改造和发展经济文化的三年计划（1958—1960年）而进行着胜利的斗争。
    和这同时，在越南南方，美帝国主义操纵的吴庭艳集团千方百计地破坏日内瓦协议，企图长期分割越南，把越南南方变成美帝国主义的殖民地和军事基地。美帝国主义操纵吴庭艳傀儡政权，在越南南方建立了法西斯恐怖统治，镇压爱国人士，迫害前抗战人员。所谓美“援”导致了南方经济的破产，半数以上的工人失业，数以千计的工厂企业倒闭。因此，越南劳动党在领导北方人民加速进行社会主义建设的同时，还为实现祖国的和平统一进行坚持不渝的斗争。越南南方的人民，发扬了团结和英勇斗争的光荣传统，正在高举和平、统一、独立和民主的旗帜，和反动统治者进行不屈不挠的斗争。
    中越两国是唇齿相依的邻邦，是休戚与共的兄弟。我们两国人民之间有着悠久的传统友谊。近百年来，在反对帝国主义侵略，争取本国的独立自由的斗争中，我们两国人民始终相互同情和支持。自从中华人民共和国成立以后，两党、两国政府和人民之间，进一步建立了更加亲密的互助合作关系。无论在反对帝国主义侵略、保卫世界和平的共同斗争中，或者在两国的社会主义建设事业中，我们两国人民兄弟般的互助合作都在日益巩固、发展。我们两国的友谊是建立在马克思列宁主义、建立在无产阶级国际主义基础之上的，是牢不可破的。最近几年，我们在社会主义建设事业中的相互支援不断加强，我们两国政府和人民之间的友好往来日益频繁。去年，中国人民所敬爱的胡志明主席亲自率领越南党政代表团，参加了我国建国十周年的庆祝活动。这对于正在为加速建设社会主义而奋斗的中国人民是一个巨大的鼓舞。今年5月间，我国周恩来总理访问越南民主共和国，中越两国党和政府领导人举行了会谈，进一步加强了两国、两党之间的牢不可破的团结和友谊。我们之间的互助合作，不仅促进了两国经济和文化的共同高涨，同时也有利于维护亚洲和世界和平。
    今天，在中越两国人民共同欢庆越南民主共和国成立十五周年这一光辉节日的时刻，我谨向兄弟的越南人民表示衷心的祝贺：
    祝中越两国人民牢不可破的兄弟友谊万古长青！
    祝越南人民在越南劳动党和胡志明主席的英明领导下，在社会主义建设事业中，在统一祖国和反对美帝国主义的正义斗争中，获得新的伟大胜利！
