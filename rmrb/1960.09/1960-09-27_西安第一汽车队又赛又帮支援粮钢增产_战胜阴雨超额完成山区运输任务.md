Xi'an, September 26th (From our newspaper) The workers of the First Motorcade of the Xi'an Transportation Company in Shaanxi Province, through concerted efforts in the increased production and economy campaign, overcame difficulties such as continuous rain and muddy mountain roads, and overfulfilled the transportation tasks of key materials, powerfully supporting the increase in grain and steel production.

The First Motorcade of the Xi'an Transportation Company is an old Red Flag Motorcade of Shaanxi Province and Xi'an City. From January to August this year, the transport efficiency of the motorcade's trucks averaged more than 18,400 ton-kilometers per vehicle per month, saving more than 130,000 tons of gasoline, and by the end of June, it had comprehensively overfulfilled the annual national transportation plan.

This motorcade is responsible for the transportation tasks from Xi'an to Shangnan and other counties in the Qinling Mountains. Of the 290-plus kilometers of transportation distance, mountain roads account for more than 250 kilometers, with steep slopes, many bends, and uneven road surfaces. Since August, continuous rain has made driving even more difficult. In order to ensure the transportation of key materials, they decided to break the conventional practice of not using trailers on poorly maintained mountain roads during the rainy season, and divided the motorcade's vehicles into many groups, each led by an experienced driver using trailers. Based on past experience, they would rush to transport materials from the branch lines to the main lines on sunny days, and then concentrate on transporting materials from the main lines on rainy days; they would drive on bad road sections during the day and on better road sections at night.

The entire motorcade launched a vigorous competition centered on overcoming the rainy season and ensuring the completion of key material transportation tasks. In the competition, groups helped other groups, drivers helped other drivers, and work types helped other work types. Chen Zhizhong's group and Yu Hongxiang's group were old rivals in the competition. They chased each other, unwilling to give way; but when Li Qingxi of Chen Zhizhong's group encountered Lin Zhiyi's vehicle from Yu Hongxiang's group parked on the roadside due to a broken axle while driving in the rain, he hitched his car to his, took it to Dawangzhai, fifteen kilometers away, found an axle to repair the car, and drove with him, helping him to tow the trailer uphill. Since the start of the competition, the driving groups of Lu Heping and Chen Xianwu have constantly helped each other, enabling the other party to catch up with them, and recently both have been rated as the Red Flag groups of the entire motorcade.

In order to overcome the rainy season and ensure the completion of key material transportation tasks, all the leading cadres and technicians of the motorcade went down to the lines to specifically help the groups improve their management and technical levels. The captain, Feng Jingpei, went to the lines to inspect the highways and bridges that the motorcade's vehicles passed through, section by section, identifying problems and immediately contacting the road maintenance sections for emergency repairs to ensure that the vehicles could pass without hindrance, regardless of the weather. The deputy captain, Li Wenying, specifically directed traffic in the dangerous sections of the Qinling Mountains, helping to solve problems and greatly boosting the drivers' morale. The staff of the service departments also went deep into the lines to carry out a competition to "be good quartermasters." In August, under rainy conditions, the vehicle availability rate increased by 4% compared to July.

    西安第一汽车队又赛又帮支援粮钢增产
　　战胜阴雨超额完成山区运输任务
    本报西安26日电　陕西省西安运输公司第一汽车队职工在增产节约竞赛中，齐心协力战胜阴雨连绵、山路泥泞等困难，超额完成了重点物资的运输任务，有力地支援了粮食和钢铁的增产。
    西安运输公司第一汽车队是陕西省、西安市的老红旗汽车队。今年1至8月份，全队货运汽车的运输效率平均达到车吨月产一万八千四百多吨公里，节约汽油十三万多吨，至6月底已全面超额完成了全年国家运输计划。
    这个队担负着由西安至秦岭山区商南等县的运输任务。在二百九十多公里的运距中，山路就占二百五十多公里，坡陡、弯多、路面不平。8月份以来，阴雨连绵，行驶更加困难。为了保证重点物资的运输，他们决定打破雨季在路况较差的山区行车不带拖车的常规，把全队的车辆分成许多小组，每组都由一位老司机带领拖挂行驶。他们还根据过去的经验，晴天时把支线的物资抢运到干线上，雨天再集中运干线的物资；白天跑路况坏的路段，夜间跑路况较好的路段。
    全队围绕着战胜雨季、保证完成重点物资运输任务展开了热烈的竞赛。在竞赛中，组与组、司机与司机、工种与工种之间又赛又帮。陈志忠组与郁鸿祥组是竞赛中的老对手。他们你追我赶，互不相让；但当有一次陈志忠组的李庆西在冒雨行驶中，遇到郁鸿祥组的林志义的车因车轴折断停在路旁时，就把他的车挂在自己的车上，带到十五公里远的大王寨，找到车轴把车修好，并和他一块行驶，上坡时帮助他拖挂。卢和平和陈宪武两个驾驶组自开展竞赛以来，不断地互相帮助，使对方赶上自己，最近都被评为全队的红旗组。
    为了战胜雨季，保证完成重点物资的运输任务，全队的领导干部和技术人员都下线路，具体帮助小组提高管理水平和技术水平。队长冯竞培到线路上，对本队车辆通过的公路和桥涵，一处一处、一段一段地进行检查，发现问题，立即与养路段联系抢修，以保证汽车晴雨无阻地通行。副队长李文英在秦岭险要的路段，专门指挥行车，帮助解决问题，大大鼓舞了驾驶员的干劲。服务部门的职工也都深入线路，开展“当好后勤兵”的竞赛。8月份在多雨的情况下，车辆的完好率较7月份还提高了4％。
