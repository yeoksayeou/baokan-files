Looking Ahead
An Investigation Report on Labor Use in the Second Production Team of the Satellite Management Area (Part 3)
The CCP Wusheng County Committee Correspondence Group, Our Newspaper Reporter

In early autumn, the Jialing River roared as usual. In previous years, this marked the prelude to the "Five Autumns" (harvesting, plowing, sowing, managing, and storing). This year, it's like a "post-event analysis." The Second Production Team of the Satellite Management Area, Jiuxian Commune, Wusheng County, Sichuan, which borders the river, had already fully launched the "Five Autumns" battle, and was taking a leading position in the entire commune. The area of late autumn crops in this team has doubled compared to last year. The area for small spring crops sown this autumn and harvested next summer, as well as the area for next year's large spring crops and late autumn crops, will also be expanded compared to this year. At the same time, the area occupied by high-yield fields each season will also be expanded. Needless to say, to achieve this plan, the workload will increase significantly. However, the Second Production Team of the Satellite Management Area in Jiuxian Commune not only has the confidence to plant more, but also has the labor force to guarantee the implementation of various high-yield measures. If you ask them how they resolve the contradiction between continuous leaps forward and labor shortages, the commune members will tell you so straightforwardly: it all depends on Secretary Wang looking ahead.

The Secretary Wang the commune members are talking about is the county's model branch secretary, Wang Dingchang, the branch secretary of the Satellite Management Area. Since the Great Leap Forward in 1958, he has been assigned to reside permanently in the Second Production Team. Every year before autumn, he leads the masses to formulate a long-term plan for the next year's production and labor force arrangement and use. The so-called long-term plan starts from the autumn sowing of the previous year and ends before the autumn sowing of the next year. Because the small spring crops sown in the previous autumn are harvested in the summer of the following year, the autumn sowing each year marks the beginning of a new production year. At the same time, what crops are planted this season and when they are sown are related to the crop mix for the entire next year, and the crop mix determines the agricultural labor use in each period in the future. In order to arrange the labor force well in advance from a broad perspective, he always racks his brains for labor deployment before autumn. Like in the past, he has been pondering for a long time this time to help the Second Production Team arrange its labor force.

The Branch Secretary's Concerns

"Missing four thousand five, what should we do?" "I don't know!" Wang Dingchang's little child looked at her father, who was lost in thought, and answered helplessly. "How can we do four thousand five more, and also guarantee a combination of work and rest?" "Go to sleep, think about it tomorrow!" Wang Dingchang's wife knew that her husband was worried about his work. For this "four thousand five," Wang Dingchang had already discussed it with production team leader Chen Yuanwen, deputy team leader Chen Deyou, and twenty or thirty commune members in the team many times. The "four thousand five" that the branch secretary kept in mind was nothing else, but the newly added workload in agricultural production for the Second Production Team from this autumn to next autumn. A month ago, Wang Dingchang led the team to formulate a leap forward plan for 1961 to further achieve more planting, high yields, and more harvests. According to this plan, agricultural production labor will increase from about 20,000 this year to more than 24,500. Judging from the situation from last autumn to this autumn, it has been very difficult to reach 20,000 agricultural labor days. Continuing to increase the workload is undoubtedly a difficult problem. However, if the newly added four thousand five hundred agricultural labor days are not resolved, it will not be possible to further achieve more planting, high yields, and more harvests from this autumn to next autumn. Taking small spring crops as an example, when sowing and field management are carried out in October and November this year, they will clash with harvesting large spring crops and late autumn crops and other farm work; when they are harvested in April and May next year, they will also "butt heads" with summer planting and other farm work. In short, labor shortage is an obvious difficulty.

Night Visit to an Old Poor Peasant

"Nothing is difficult in the world, if you put your heart into it." This "four thousand five" certainly cannot stump Wang Dingchang, a "good housekeeper" who "cares about the people's suffering like a sheep and implements the Party's policies like a piece of iron." One night, he bought some sweets and visited the old poor peasant Lu Shuangquan's illness by moonlight, and by the way, had a long talk about the problem of labor shortage. After some consideration, the old man Lu Shuangquan asked Wang Dingchang: "How much agricultural labor will be needed next year?" "Twenty-four thousand five." "How much labor is used on average each month during the three months of winter leisure?" "One thousand two." "How much labor is used each month during the four months of small busy season?" "One thousand five." "How much labor is used each month during the five months of the big busy season?" "Two thousand nine hundred and eighty." After Wang Dingchang answered Lu Shuangquan's questions one by one, he said: "The problem lies in the five months of the big busy season. If we calculate based on more than eighty people working every day and seventy work days per day, we can only do two thousand one hundred work days per month, which is still eight hundred and eighty work days short." At this time, the old poor peasant Lu Shuangquan mentioned that when he was working alone, because of the labor shortage, he had changed some of the fields that had always grown mid-season crops to growing early-maturing and late-autumn crops, and added phased sowing. The area sown throughout the year was expanded. Although the amount of labor used increased a little, it was not as tight as when only mid-season crops were planted. Then he expressed his feelings, saying: "In my opinion, change the crop mix and spread part of the busy farm work to the less busy and slack seasons to ensure that the farm work is not rushed in all seasons. In terms of the whole year, this is called a great combination of work and rest!" As soon as Wang Dingchang heard this, he immediately said with excitement: "That's right, Uncle Lu, you are right! When we arrange labor and deal with farm work, we must be like Chairman Mao leading the army to fight the enemy back then, dividing the enemy into many small pieces, so that we can concentrate our forces and eat them one by one." That night, he ran back to summon the production team leader Chen Yuanwen, the deputy team leader Chen Deyou, the accountant, the work group leader, etc., to discuss how to change the situation where mid-season crops were too concentrated. In the past, the vast majority of the fields in this team adopted the following crop mix: the first season was planted with wheat, rapeseed, etc.; the second season was planted with mid-season rice, corn, sweet potatoes, sorghum, etc. Now it is decided to reduce the proportion of this crop mix and increase the proportion of the following crop mix: the first season is planted with broad beans and peas; the second season is planted with early rice and early corn; and the third season is planted with late rice, autumn corn, and autumn sweet potatoes, etc. This change can increase planting and stagger fertilization times; secondly, it changes the phenomenon of too many mid-season crops and rushed farm work, so that the amount of labor used in the original busy season is reduced from 2,980 work days per month to about 2,500 work days. Deducting the originally planned 2,100 work days, there is still a shortage of more than 400 work days per month in the busy season.

"That's easy to handle. We must make full use of the superiority of the commune, and organize teams to draw some people out to engage in collaboration during the busy season." Wang Dingchang inspired everyone to further tap the potential from another aspect. After discussion and calculation, it is estimated that the collaborative support of other teams can solve about two hundred work days. However, to engage in collaboration, it is necessary to make the crop mix and sowing period of each team different, so that they can be staggered before and after to avoid simultaneous labor shortages and free up hands. Therefore, Wang Dingchang also found the leaders of several other production teams, introducing the team's experience in crop mix on the one hand, and asking them to consider revising their production increase plans and changing their crop mix methods and sowing times to ensure that the teams are tight and relaxed at different times, and can exchange work with other teams for more than two hundred work days when necessary. After full discussion by the masses, the four production teams in the satellite management area revised their production increase plans and changed the distribution of crop mix and farm work. This plan was reported to the commune party committee and district committee overnight and was quickly approved. From the perspective of the Second Production Team of the Satellite Management Area, through changing the crop mix and mutual collaboration between teams, there is only a shortage of more than two hundred work days per month during the busy season. These two hundred or so work days can be completely solved by reforming tools, short-term arrangements, careful calculations, advancing and postponing farm work, and carrying out high work efficiency campaigns.

Strategy for Continued Great Leap Forward

However, after the problem of labor demand for busy farm work is solved, the labor demand during the less busy and winter slack seasons is quite tight. On the one hand, this is because more than two thousand work days have been moved from the five busy months to the less busy and winter slack seasons, increasing the agricultural labor in this period; on the other hand, according to the requirements of high-speed agricultural production increase, the labor demand for pig raising and tool reform has increased by 1,700 work days. Adding the two aspects together, at least 3,700 work days will be added during the seven months of the less busy and winter slack seasons.

In order to solve this problem, Wang Dingchang participated in production during the day and exchanged opinions with commune members, organized cadres and commune members to discuss at night, and calculated accounts late at night. He said: "If we sleep less now, if we can figure out a solution, we will make the commune members sleep well every night next year, and we can sleep peacefully without any worries ourselves!" With such a spirit, can we still not come up with a solution? After Wang Dingchang led the masses to repeatedly discuss and calculate accounts, he finally made the newly added three thousand seven hundred or so work days in the less busy and winter slack seasons a reality.

1.  Focus on reforming and using transportation, processing, pig raising, and infrastructure tools well, and reform tools in sets. This winter, add two hundred work days to tool reform, and save at least 2,500 work days on production in the current year next year.

2.  Multi-business focuses on pig raising, striving to double the number of live pigs and reach 1.3 pigs per mu of land. This year, pig raising uses 900 work days, accounting for 30% of the multi-business work days. In 1961, pig raising used 1,900 work days, accounting for more than 55% of the multi-business work days, an increase of 1,000 work days compared to this year; however, these people raise pigs and accumulate fertilizer, which can greatly save agricultural fertilizer accumulation work days. Because one person raising pigs and accumulating fertilizer all year round is at least equivalent to three people accumulating natural fertilizer all year round, the newly added one thousand pig raising and fertilizer accumulation work days next year can save at least three thousand agricultural fertilizer accumulation work days.

3.  Among the infrastructure construction work days last year, only 60% could benefit in the current year. Next year, 85% of the infrastructure construction work days will be invested in projects that are small in scale, require less labor, and benefit in the current year (the infrastructure construction work days used for current year benefits next year will increase by about 500 compared to this year). According to the plan, these additional 500 infrastructure construction work days are for the following projects: spending 50 work days to build a canal can expand the area of self-flowing irrigation by ten mu, saving at least 100 work days; building four sedimentation tanks, spending eight work days, can avoid the need to carry soil down the mountain to cover the fields next year, saving at least 48 work days; improving 40 mu of soil, spending 400 work days, makes the soil next year stronger in water retention and fertilizer retention capacity, saving at least 800 work days for irrigation and fertilization, etc. Therefore, the infrastructure construction this winter and next spring is used for current benefit work days, increasing by 500, and can save at least about 1,000 agricultural work days for carrying water and irrigating fields next year. Calculating this way, the above three aspects can save a total of more than 6,000 agricultural work days. Not only does it solve the difficulty of lacking 3,700 work days in the less busy and winter slack seasons, but it also provides mobile work days in the busy season.

In order to effectively ensure the implementation of the policy of taking grain as the key, engaging in diversified operations, and comprehensively developing in labor arrangement, they arranged the 22 crops and more than 100 agricultural tasks, and more than 40 key agricultural tasks in order of priority according to the changes in the cropping system, so that agricultural production, especially grain production, requires labor like a "red line" running through the whole process, implemented every month; so that the labor demand of diversified operations and other tasks fluctuates around this "red line", transferring with agriculture. Agricultural labor is increased to a certain limit, and diversified operations are reduced to a certain limit. When agricultural labor is reduced, diversified operations are increased. The approximate distribution of agricultural labor next year is as follows: April, May, August, October, and November are busy months. The minimum and maximum extent of field production labor is 75%-82% (grain production is 70%-75%); diversified operations (including pig raising) accounts for 5%-8%; living welfare accounts for 5%, and the rest is mobile labor. March, June, July, and September are relatively busy stages. Field production labor accounts for 65%-70% (grain production accounts for 60%-65%); diversified operations accounts for 15%-20%; living welfare accounts for 5%, and the rest is mobile labor. December, January, and February are general months. Agricultural labor accounts for 50%; infrastructure construction accounts for 25%; and the rest is diversified operations, living welfare, etc. Calculating this way, agricultural labor accounts for 72% of the whole year, with an average of 75 people participating in field production every month, and 65 people producing grain; infrastructure construction accounts for more than 6%; and the rest is diversified operations and living welfare. After we learned about the production process of this long-term plan related to labor, Wang Dingchang told us that looking only at the proportion of agricultural labor next year, it seems to have increased by only a few percentage points compared to previous years, but that is not the case. Because 85% of the infrastructure construction labor next year will be invested in projects that benefit agriculture in the current year; more than half of the diversified operations labor is used for pig raising and fertilizer accumulation; thus, the labor days directly and indirectly used for agricultural production are estimated to be at least 85% or more. This is the great secret to increasing agricultural labor! This is one aspect. On the other hand, we must greatly improve tools, at least to make one person equivalent to one and a half people. In this way, the 75 people in agricultural production are at least equivalent to 100 people. (End of full text)

    早看几步棋
    卫星管理区第二生产队使用劳力的调查报告（之三）
    中共武胜县委通讯组　本报记者
    初秋时候，嘉陵江照例发出了猛烈的咆哮，要在往年，这算“五秋”（收、耕、种、管、藏）的一曲前奏，今年则如同马后炮。濒临江边的四川武胜县旧县公社卫星管理区第二生产队，“五秋”激战早已全面开展，而且在全社取得遥遥领先地位。这个队的晚秋作物面积比去年扩大了两倍；今秋播种明夏收获的小春作物面积、明年大春作物和晚秋作物面积也要比今年扩大；同时，每季高产田所占面积也要扩大。不用说，要实现这一计划，工作量有很大增加。可是旧县公社卫星管理区第二生产队，不仅有把握多种，而且在贯彻各项高产措施时能有劳力保证。要问他们怎样解决持续跃进与劳动力不足的矛盾，那末，社员们就会如此明快地告诉你：全靠汪书记早看几步棋。
    社员们所说的汪书记，是全县支部书记的标兵，卫星管理区支部书记汪定昌。他自1958年大跃进以来，便分工常驻第二生产队。每年秋前，他都要领导群众提早制定下一年的生产计划和劳动力安排使用的长计划。所谓长计划，是从上一年秋播开始，到下一年秋播以前为止。因为前秋种下的小春作物要在第二年夏天收获，每年秋播就标志着一个新的生产年度开始。同时，这一季作物种什么，啥时播种，关系下一年全年的作物搭配，而作物搭配又决定今后每一时期的农业用工。为了提前从大的方面摆布好劳动力，他总是在秋前为劳力布局苦思苦想。像过去一样，他这次帮助第二生产队安排劳力，又绞了很久的脑汁。
    支部书记的心事
    “差了四千五，应该怎么办呢？”“不晓得！”汪定昌的小娃娃望着她正在出神的父亲，不知所措地这样回答。“怎样才能既多做四千五，又保证劳逸结合？”“睡吧，明天再想吧！”汪定昌的爱人知道她丈夫是在为工作伤脑筋。为了这“四千五”，汪定昌已经跟生产队长陈远文、副队长陈德友，以及队上二、三十个社员讨论多次了。支部书记念念不忘的“四千五”不是别的，而是第二生产队今秋到明秋在农业生产方面新增加的工作量。这是一个月以前，汪定昌领导该队制定了1961年进一步实现多种、高产、多收的跃进计划，按照这个计划，农业生产用工要从今年的二万个左右，增加到二万四千五百多个。从去秋到今秋的情况来看，农业用工达到二万个，已经是很难得的事情了，再继续增加工作量无疑要算一个难题。可是，新增加的四千五百个农业用工要不解决，今秋到明秋就不能进一步实现多种、高产、多收。就以小春作物来说吧，今年10月、11月进行播种和田间管理时，便与收获大春作物和晚秋作物等农活打挤；到了明年4、5月收获时，又与夏种等农活发生“顶牛”现象。总之，劳动力不足是明摆着的困难。
    夜访老贫农
    “天下无难事，只怕有心人”，这“四千五”当然不能将汪定昌这种“关心群众疾苦像一只羊，贯彻党的政策像一块铁”的“好当家”难倒。一天晚上，他买了一些糖果，踏着月光去探望老贫农陆双全的病情，顺便就对劳力不足的问题作了一次长谈。陆双全老头经过一番考虑后，向汪定昌问道：“明年的农业用工是多少呢？”“二万四千五”。“冬闲三个月每月平均用工多少？”“一千二”。“小忙四个月，每月用工多少？”“一千五”。“大忙五个月每月用工多少？”“二千九百八”。汪定昌一一回答了陆双全的问话后说：“问题就在大忙这五个月上边，按照每天出工八十多人，每天作七十个工计算，每月只能做二千一百个工，还差八百八十个工。”这时，老贫农陆双全就提起他单干时，因为劳力不足，曾经将一部分历来种中熟作物的田地，改为种早熟和晚秋作物，再加上分期分批播种，全年播种的面积扩大了，用工量虽然增加了一点，但却不像光种中熟作物时劳力那么紧了。随后他又发表感想说：“依我看，改变作物搭配，把大忙的农活，分散一部分在小忙和农闲时候来作，保证一年四季的农活不打挤，就全年来说，这叫大劳逸结合！”汪定昌一听，立刻就带着一种激动的语气说：“对头，陆大爷你说的对头！我们安排劳力，对付农活，也要像毛主席当年领导部队打敌人一样，把敌人分散成很多小块块，让我们自己集中力量，一个个地吃掉它。”他当夜就跑回去召集生产队长陈远文、副队长陈德友和会计、作业组长等，讨论如何改变中熟作物过分集中的状况。过去这个队绝大部分田地都采用以下的作物搭配方法：第一季种植小麦、油菜等；第二季种植中熟水稻、玉米、红薯、高粱等。现在决定降低这种作物搭配所占的比重，提高下列作物搭配的比重：第一季种蚕豆、豌豆；第二季种早稻、早玉米；第三季种晚稻、秋玉米、秋红薯等。这么改变，一则可以多种和错开需肥时间；再则改变了中熟作物过多，农活打挤的现象，使原定大忙期中的用工量，由每月二千九百八十个工，降低为二千五百个左右，减去本来计划的二千一百个工，大忙期中每月还差四百多个工。
    “这就好办了。我们要充分利用公社优越性，大忙要组织各队抽出一些人来搞协作。”汪定昌启发大家再从另一方面来挖潜力。经过讨论计算，估计外队的协作支援可解决二百来个工。不过，要搞协作，就必须使各队的作物搭配情况和播种时期有所不同，以便前后错开，避免劳力同时吃紧，腾不出手来。于是，汪定昌又找了其它几个生产队的队长，一面介绍这个队搭配作物的经验，一面让他们考虑修订增产计划，改变作物搭配方法和播种时间，以保证队与队之间你紧我弛，必要时能与外队换工二百多个。经过群众充分讨论后，卫星管理区的四个生产队便修订了增产计划，改变了作物搭配和农活分布状况。这个计划连夜报到公社党委、区委后，很快就被批准了。从卫星管理区第二生产队的情况来看，通过改变作物搭配，以及各队相互协作，大忙期中每月只差二百多个工。这两百多个工，通过改革工具，短安排，精打细算，将农活前提后移以及开展高工效运动，完全可以得到解决。
    持续大跃进的战略
    可是，大忙的农活需工问题解决之后，小忙与冬闲的需工，却相当紧张。一方面，这是由于大忙五个月朝小忙和冬闲移了二千多个工，使这一段时间的农业用工增加了；另一方面，根据农业高速度增产的要求，养猪、工具改革等需工量增加一千七百个。两方面加起来，小忙和冬闲七个月之中至少增加三千七百个工。
    为了解决这个问题，汪定昌白天一边参加生产，一边找社员交换意见；晚上组织干部和社员讨论；到了深夜，又点着灯算账。他说：“我们现在少睡一阵，要是想出办法来，明年就会使社员夜夜睡足，也能使我们自己无牵无挂睡个安稳！”有了这样的精神，还能想不出办法来？汪定昌领导群众反复讨论算账以后，终于使小忙和冬闲期中新增加的三千七百多个工落了实。
    一、以改好用好运输、加工、养猪和基建工具为重点，成套改革工具。今冬在工具改革上增加二百个工，明年至少在当年生产上节省二千五百个工。
    二、多种经营突出抓养猪，力争生猪翻一番，达到每亩地养猪一点三头。今年养猪用工有九百个，占多种经营用工30％。1961年养猪用工一千九百个，占多种经营用工55％以上，比今年增加一千个；但是，这些人养猪积肥，就可以大大节省农业积肥用工。由于一人常年养猪积肥，至少抵三人常年积自然肥，明年新增加的一千个养猪积肥用工，至少可节约农业积肥用工三千个。
    三、去年基本建设用工中，能够当年受益的仅占60％，明年85％的基本建设用工都投入规模小、花工少、当年受益的项目（明年用于当年受益的基本建设用工，比今年增加五百个左右）。根据计划，这增加的五百个基本建设用工，项目如下：花工五十个修一条水渠可扩大自流灌溉面积十亩，至少节省一百个工；修沉沙函四个，花工八个，可以避免明年下山挑土盖田，至少节省四十八个工；改良土壤四十亩，花工四百个，使明年的土壤增强保水、保肥能力，至少可节省浇灌和施肥用工八百个等。因此，基本建设今冬明春用于当前受益工作日增加五百个，至少可节省明年挑水灌田等农业用工一千个左右。这样算下来，以上三方面共可节省农业用工六千个以上。不但解决了小忙和冬闲期中缺少三千七百个工的困难，而且使大忙期中有了机动的工作日。
    为了切实保证在劳力安排上，贯彻以粮为纲，多种经营，全面发展的方针，他们根据耕作制度的变化，将全年二十二种作物、一百多项农活、四十多项中心农活，依先后次序排队，使农业生产，尤其是粮食生产需工像一根“红线”一样贯穿始终，月月落实；使多种经营等需工围绕着这根“红线”波动，以农业为转移，农业用工在一定限度增加，多种经营则在一定限度内减少，农业用工减少，多种经营则增加。明年农业用工大致分布情况如下：4月、5月、8月、10月、11月为大忙月份，田间生产用工最低和最大限度为75％—82％（粮食生产为70％—75％）；多种经营（包括养猪）占5％—8％；生活福利占5％，其余为机动工。3月、6月、7月、9月为较忙阶段，田间生产用工占65％—70％（粮食生产占60％—65％）；多种经营占15％—20％；生活福利占5％，其余为机动工。12月、1月、2月，为一般月份，农业用工占50％；基本建设占25％；其余为多种经营、生活福利等。这样算下来，全年农业用工占72％，每月平均有七十五人参加田间生产，六十五人生产粮食；基本建设占6％以上；其余为多种经营和生活福利。在我们了解了这一段有关劳动力的长计划的生产过程之后，汪定昌告诉我们，光看明年农业用工的比例，好像只比往年增加了百分之几，其实不然，由于明年85％的基本建设用工是投于农业当年受益的项目；二分之一以上的多种经营用工是用于养猪积肥；这样，直接间接用到农业生产上的劳动日，估计至少在85％以上。这是增加农业用工的大窍门啊！这是一方面。另一方面，我们要大改工具，至少让一个人抵一个半用。这样，农业生产上的七十五个人，至少就抵一百个人用了。（全文完）
