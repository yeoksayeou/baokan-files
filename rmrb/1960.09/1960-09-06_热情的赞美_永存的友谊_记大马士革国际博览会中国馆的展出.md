    Enthusiastic Praise, Everlasting Friendship
    ——On the Exhibition of the Chinese Pavilion at the Damascus International Fair
    Lin Hai Cheng Liangping

    The Light of the Great Leap Forward
    In the height of summer in Damascus, the sky is clear and the sun shines brightly. At the site of the Seventh Damascus International Fair, the five-star red flag of the People's Republic of China flutters in the breeze atop the palace-style vermilion gate of the Chinese Pavilion. At this fair, the Chinese Pavilion is one of the most popular and closely watched exhibition halls. On the evening of August 15th, when the fair officially opened, a continuous stream of people, bathed in the brilliant lights, walked along the Barada River towards the six vermilion gates illuminated by several red palace lanterns. On that day, in just over three hours, more than five thousand visitors toured the Chinese Pavilion. They came here with friendly feelings and a desire to understand. In this exhibition hall, covering more than 1,700 square meters, they saw a magnificent picture of China's socialist construction. China has participated in the past six Damascus International Fairs, with the exception of last year's. Only a year has passed, a short time, but how great the changes in China have been! Friends from Arab countries were amazed by the rapid progress of the new China.
    This year, the Chinese Exhibition Hall displayed more than three thousand products, including four sections: heavy industry, agricultural and sideline products, light industry and textiles, and handicrafts. In addition to the rich display of physical objects, there were also many photographs, charts, and electric models, which depicted the achievements of the Chinese people in industry, agriculture, and other fields over the past ten years since liberation, especially since the Great Leap Forward. The introduction of the People's Commune was also one of the new features of this exhibition hall.
    The characteristic of this year's Chinese Pavilion is that heavy industry accounts for a large proportion, accounting for 50% of the entire exhibits, and it is also the most praised part by the audience. Here, not only are the steel products, new machine tools, power machines, electrical equipment, and various machines and precision instruments produced by various large enterprises exhibited, but also huge pictures of small-scale blast furnace groups, which emerged during the Great Leap Forward and promoted the leap-forward development of China's steel production, are on display.
    Particularly noteworthy is the "Red Flag" brand car. So many people surrounded it, praising it non-stop. Among the crowd, one could often hear simple and sincere words of praise such as "Excellent!" and "Truly remarkable!" Especially some drivers and workers, with expressions of amazement and joy, looked at the outside, and then at the inside, gently touching the shiny car body; some even lay under the car to look at the chassis device. Some drivers told the staff of the Chinese Pavilion that this car, due to its high chassis and strong body, is very suitable for driving in the mountainous and desert areas of the Middle East, and they hoped to have the opportunity to drive such a beautiful and exquisitely made car. Some even asked with a tone of surprise: "Is it made in China?" When the Chinese staff gave a positive answer, they gave the Chinese Pavilion staff a knowing smile with great satisfaction. On the night of August 17th, when the Chinese Pavilion was about to close, the lights illuminating the "Red Flag" brand car had been turned off, but there were still four visitors striking matches to look at the car.
    Next to the operating nail-making machine, weaving machine, and other machines, there were also dense crowds. From here, people saw the rapid improvement of China's steel industry and technological level. A Syrian textile merchant who had stayed in Shanghai in old China from 1939 to 1941 praised the Shanghai-made M1293 spinning machine exhibited in the exhibition hall, saying, "You have made great progress in heavy industry!"
    In the exhibition hall, China's rural construction also attracted the interest of the audience. In front of the electric models of water conservancy projects and people's communes, there was also an endless stream of people, especially many farmers from various places who watched the electric models of the people's communes attentively, listening to the Arabic explanations. Through the visit, people began to understand the people's communes in China, and the shameless slanders spread by Western imperialism about the people's communes in China were shattered by powerful facts. Three farmers from Aleppo, the largest city in northern Syria, shouted "Long live the People's China!" after visiting the long-term plan of the People's Commune. They also asked the staff of the exhibition hall for seeds of agricultural products planted by the People's Commune.

    Praise and Wishes
    During these days of the Chinese Pavilion's exhibition, hundreds and thousands of visitors left their beautiful praises and enthusiastic congratulations. They wrote in the guestbook: "The Damascus Fair is proud of the participation of the Chinese Pavilion, because it is a brilliant symbol of this fair"; "I cannot express my gratitude to the Chinese people, I think it is the top country in terms of industrial progress and world civilization." An engineer wrote, "The exhibits in the Chinese Pavilion show its great technological progress, especially heavy industrial products. I am an engineer, and those precision instruments also make me very happy." People also expressed their respect for the great leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao. One visitor said: "The achievements made by the Chinese people under the leadership of Chairman Mao have enabled the Chinese people to defeat imperialism in every aspect." In the daily guestbook, you can also find countless such blessings: "Long live the great People's China!" "Wish you more prosperity and progress!" "Salute to the Chinese people!" "Go ahead! Brotherly Chinese people, may God bless you to advance at high speed!"
    In these enthusiastic praises and friendly wishes, we deeply appreciate the deep affection of the Arab people for the Chinese people. They cheer for the achievements of the Chinese people and feel proud. Indeed, for many years, the people of Asia and Africa have been considered by Western colonialists to be the most backward countries and nations. However, the rapid progress of the Chinese people today has shattered the slanders of the Western colonialists. After visiting the Chinese Pavilion, people not only saw the earth-shaking changes that have taken place in this country that was once enslaved by imperialism, but also gained encouragement and strength from here. Many visitors wrote in the guestbook: "Your achievements have given us great encouragement." A visitor said excitedly after the visit: "Colonialists are heading for death, while the People's China is advancing!" The audience also said: "Everything we see in the Chinese Pavilion is one of the greatest phenomena of our time." An Arab friend warmly greeted the Chinese people: "Congratulations to the Chinese people! Although the colonialists refuse to recognize you, you are advancing on the road of struggle and construction!" "Today's China is a fortress of progress, civilization and peace!"

    Our Friends Are All Over the World
    When China held exhibitions in India, Pakistan, and many other countries, we deeply felt the friendship of the people of various countries towards the Chinese people. And this time, the exhibition of the Chinese Pavilion in Damascus made us once again appreciate the friendship of the people of the United Arab Republic and all Arab people towards the Chinese people. From the moment people walked into the Chinese Pavilion, the remoteness of thousands of mountains and rivers between the Chinese and Arab peoples lost its meaning in an instant, didn't it? People here not only saw the new reality of the new China, but also exchanged friendship with the Chinese people here. Indeed, in these days, when Chinese people walk on the streets of Damascus and the squares of the fair, they will always encounter friendly smiles and cordial greetings from the Arab people! Many people from the United Arab Republic wrote in the guestbook: "Long live the friendship between the Chinese and Arab people!" "Your exhibition here shows the love of the Chinese people for the people of the United Arab Republic!" An old artist bought a box of Arabic pastries and gave it to the staff of the Chinese Exhibition Hall to express his friendly feelings. All these friendly words and scenes are the heartfelt voices of the people of the United Arab Republic. Imperialists have tried every means to undermine the friendship between the Chinese people and the people of various Arab countries, but here, people answered the malicious provocations of the imperialists. They wrote: "The Arabs are the confidants of the Chinese people." Another visitor said: "We missed you infinitely last year when you did not come to participate in the fair, and this year we are deeply delighted because of your return!" What deep and sincere feelings! This year's exhibition in the Chinese Pavilion enabled people to relive the friendship of the past here, and also increased new understanding.
    During these days, the Chinese Pavilion not only received hundreds of thousands of people from the United Arab Republic, but also received visitors from other Arab countries. People from Arab countries such as Jordan, Lebanon, and Saudi Arabia also showed great interest in the Chinese Exhibition Hall. Visitors from various Arab countries also expressed the friendship of the people of various Arab countries to the Chinese people in the guestbook. A friend from Lebanon wrote: "China and Lebanon are both countries that have suffered from the shackles of imperialism, but today, China has made great achievements. Therefore, every achievement of yours is particularly cordial to the Lebanese."
    Now, the Seventh Damascus Fair is still continuing, and the six open vermilion gates of the Chinese Pavilion are still continuing to receive a large number of Arab visitors. In just the past short week, nearly two hundred thousand people have visited the Chinese Pavilion. They brought the friendship for the Chinese people, and at the same time made us deeply feel that our friends are all over the world, and the flowers of friendship between the Chinese people and the people of various countries will never fade.

    热情的赞美　永存的友谊
    ——记大马士革国际博览会中国馆的展出
    林海　程良平
    大跃进的光芒
    盛夏的大马士革，晴空万里，阳光灿烂，在第七届大马士革国际博览会场地的上空，中华人民共和国的五星红旗在中国馆宫殿式的朱红门楼上迎风招展，在这一届的博览会上，中国馆是最受观众欢迎和注意的展览馆之一。当8月15日博览会正式开幕的那个傍晚，川流不息的人群乘着灯火辉煌的夜色，沿着巴拉达河向着那被几盏红色宫灯照耀着的六扇朱红大门走来。那一天仅仅三个多小时内，就有五千以上的观众参观了中国馆。人们带着友好的情意，带着寻求了解的心愿来到这里。他们在这个一千七百多平方米的展览馆里，看到了中国社会主义建设的一幅壮丽的图景。过去六届大马士革国际博览会，除了去年一届以外，中国都参加了。仅仅阔别一年，时间虽短，但中国的变化该有多大啊！阿拉伯国家的朋友们都为新中国的这种飞速进步而感到惊讶。
    今年中国展览馆展出了三千多件产品，其中包括重工业、农业副业土特产、轻工业纺织工业及手工艺品等四部分。在这里，除了丰富的实物展出以外，还有许多照片、图表和电动模型，它为参观者描画出了中国人民在解放十年来，特别是大跃进以来在工业、农业以及其它各方面的成就。而人民公社的介绍也是这次展览馆的新内容之一。
    今年中国馆的特点是重工业占有很大比重，它占整个展品的50％，而且也是最受观众赞扬的一部分。在这里不仅展出了各种大型企业所生产的钢铁产品、新式的工作母机、动力机、电器设备以及各种机器和精密仪表，而且还展出了在大跃进中所出现的促进中国钢铁生产飞跃发展的小洋群的巨幅图片。
    特别引人注意的是那一辆“红旗”牌小汽车，多少人围在它的旁边，赞叹不已，人群中不时可以听到“好极了”、“真了不起”这一类的简单而诚挚的赞语。特别是一些司机工人，他们带着惊叹喜悦的心情，看看外面，又看里面，用手轻轻地抚摸着显得发亮的车身；有的人还伏在车身下看一看底盘的装置。一些司机向中国馆的工作人员说：这辆汽车由于车的底盘高和车身结实，它十分适合在中东的山地和沙漠地带行驶，他们并希望能有机会驾驶这样外型漂亮、质地精美的汽车。有的人甚至带着惊异的口吻问道：“是中国造的？”当中国工作人员作出肯定的回答时，他们十分满意地向中国馆的工作人员发出了会心的微笑。8月17日的夜晚，当中国馆快要闭馆的时候，照着“红旗”牌小汽车的电灯已经关闭了，但还有四个观众擦亮了火柴在看这辆汽车。
    在开动着的轧钉机、织布机和其它的一些机器旁边，也围满了密密的人群，从这里人们看到了中国钢铁工业和技术水平的迅速提高。一个曾经在1939年到1941年在旧中国的上海呆过的叙利亚纺织商人，在看了展览馆中展出的上海造的M1293型纺纱机后，连声赞叹说：“你们在重工业方面获得了巨大的进步！”
    在展览馆里，中国的农村建设同样吸引着观众们的兴趣。在兴修水利、人民公社等电动模型的前面，也是络绎不绝的人群，特别是来自各地的许多农民聚精会神地看着人民公社的电动模型，听着阿拉伯文的讲解。通过参观，人们对中国的人民公社开始有了了解，西方帝国主义曾经在这里散布的对于中国人民公社的无耻诬蔑，被强有力的事实所粉碎了。有三个来自叙利亚北部最大城市阿勒颇的农民在参观了人民公社的远景规划后，高呼：“人民中国万岁！”他们还向展览馆的工作人员索取人民公社所种植的农产品的种籽。
    赞美和祝愿
    在中国馆展出的这些日子里，成百上千的观众留下了他们美好的赞语和热情的祝贺。他们在留言本上写道：“大马士革博览会由于中国馆的参加而感到骄傲，因为它是这次博览会的一个光辉的象征”；“我无法表明我对中国人民的感激，我认为它在工业进步和世界文明方面都是头等的国家。”有一个工程师写道，“中国馆的展品表明了它在技术上的巨大进步，特别是重工业产品，我是一个工程师，那些精密仪器也使我十分高兴。”人们还对中国人民的伟大领袖毛主席表示颂敬之意，一个观众说：“中国人民在毛泽东主席领导下所获得的成就，使中国人民无论在那一方面都能战胜帝国主义。”在每天的留言簿里，你还可以找到无数条这样的祝词：“伟大的人民中国万岁！”祝你们更加繁荣和进步！”“向中国人民致敬！”“前进吧！兄弟的中国人民，愿真主保佑你们高速度地前进！”
    在这些热情的赞语和友好的祝愿中，我们深深体会到阿拉伯人民对中国人民的深情厚意，他们为中国人民的成就而欢呼、而感到骄傲。的确，多少年来，亚非人民一直被西方殖民者认为是最落后的国家和民族。然而今天中国人民的飞速前进粉碎了西方殖民者的诽谤。人们在参观了中国馆后，不仅看到了这个曾经遭受帝国主义奴役的国家如今有了何等翻天覆地的变化，而且也从这里得到了鼓舞和力量。许多观众在留言簿上写道：“你们所取得的成就，给了我们巨大的鼓舞”。一个观众在参观之后兴奋地说：“殖民主义者在走向死亡，而人民中国在前进！”观众们还说：“我们在中国馆所看到的一切，是我们这个时代最伟大的现象之一。”有一位阿拉伯的朋友热情地向中国人民致意：“祝贺中国人民！尽管殖民主义者拒绝承认你们，但你们却在斗争和建设的道路上前进！”“今天的中国是进步、文明与和平的堡垒！”
    我们的朋友遍天下
    当中国在印度，在巴基斯坦以及许多其它国家举行展览会时，我们都曾深切感受到各国人民对中国人民的友谊。而这一次中国馆在大马士革的展出，使我们又体会到了阿联人民以及所有阿拉伯人民对中国人民的友谊。从人们走进中国馆的那一刹那起，中阿人民之间千山万水的遥隔不是在顷刻间就消失了它的意义了么？人们在这里不仅看到了新中国崭新的现实，同时也在这里交流了和中国人民之间的友谊。的确，在这些日子里，中国人走在大马士革的街头和博览会的广场上，随时都会遇到阿拉伯人民友好的微笑、亲切的招呼！许多阿联人在留言簿上写着：“中阿人民的友谊万岁”！“你们在这里的展出，表现了中国人民对阿联人民的友爱！”还有一个老艺人买了一盒阿拉伯点心送给中国展览馆的工作人员，以表示他的一点友好的心意。这一切友好的话语和情景正是阿联人民的心声。帝国主义者千方百计地企图破坏中国人民和阿拉伯各国人民之间的友谊，但在这里，人们回答了帝国主义者的这种恶意的挑拨，他们写道：“阿拉伯人是中国人民的知心朋友”。还有一个观众说：“去年你们没有来参加博览会，我们无限怀念你们，而今年我们由于你们的再度来临而深感喜悦！”这是多么深厚真挚的情意！今年中国馆的展出，使人们在这里重温了昔日的友情，同时还增加了新的了解。
    在这些日子里，中国馆不仅接待了成千上万的阿联人民，而且还接待了其他阿拉伯国家的观众们。那些来自约旦、黎巴嫩、沙特阿拉伯等阿拉伯国家的人民对中国展览馆也表现了极大的兴趣。阿拉伯各国的观众们同样在留言本上表达了阿拉伯各国人民对中国人民的友情。一位来自黎巴嫩的朋友写道：“中国和黎巴嫩同样是遭受过帝国主义枷锁束缚的国家，但今天，中国已取得了巨大的成就。因此，你们的每一项成就对于黎巴嫩人来说都特别感到亲切。”
    现在，大马士革第七届博览会还在继续举行着，中国馆那六扇敞开着的朱红大门还正在继续接待着大量阿拉伯的观众。仅仅在过去短短一周的时间里，已经有将近二十万人参观了中国馆。他们带来了对于中国人民的友情，同时也使我们深切地感到，我们的朋友遍布天下，中国人民和各国人民的友谊的花朵，是永远也开不败的。
