    Xinhua News Agency, 13th: The rising anti-American sentiment and growing political turmoil among the Iranian people have forced Washington to quietly withdraw some of its military and political personnel who control the Iranian government and armed forces.
    According to reports, one-third of the officers and soldiers of the U.S. military delegation have left Iran. The number of American civil affairs "advisors" controlling fifteen Iranian ministries and national institutions "will be reduced to 264 by the end of this year."
    West Germany's Deutsche Presse-Agentur, citing an American source in Tehran, revealed that the American military delegation in Iran "has always been considered the largest delegation in the region between Turkey and the Far East," and "its size is second only to the American delegation in South Korea." In addition to a vast network of military bases, the United States still has approximately 7,000 military and political personnel stationed in Iran.

    伊朗人民反美情绪日益高涨
    美国被迫撤走部分军事人员
    据新华社13日讯　伊朗人民日益高涨的反美情绪和日益发展的政治动荡，迫使华盛顿悄悄地撤走一部分统治着伊朗政府和武装部队的军政人员。
    据报道：美国军事代表团已经有三分之一的官兵离开伊朗。而控制伊朗十五个部和国家机构的美国民政“顾问”的数目，“到今年年底，将减少到二百六十四人”。
    西德的德意志新闻社援引德黑兰的一个美国人士的话透露，伊朗的美国军事代表团“一直被认为是土耳其和远东之间的这个地区规模最大的代表团”，“其规模仅次于南朝鲜的美国代表团”。除了庞大的军事基地网而外，美国在伊朗仍然驻留了大约七千名军政人员。
