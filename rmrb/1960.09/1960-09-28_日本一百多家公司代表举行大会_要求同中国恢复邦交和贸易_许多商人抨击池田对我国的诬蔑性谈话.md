The conference passed a resolution expressing welcome for Chinese Premier Zhou Enlai's remarks regarding Sino-Japanese relations and Sino-Japanese trade. The resolution emphasized that in order to conclude a government-level trade agreement and promote private trade with China, the Japanese people must strive to urge the government to restore diplomatic relations with China on the basis of the Three Principles of Sino-Japanese Relations.

President of the International Trade Promotion Association, Kumaichi Yamamoto, Vice President Eiichi Shukutani, Director General of the Japan-China Friendship Association, Hajime Mishima, and Director General of the Japan-China Cultural Exchange Association, Kenzo Nakajima, spoke at the meeting, unanimously calling for the conference to immediately launch a strong movement to strive for the conclusion of an intergovernmental trade agreement on the basis of the Three Principles of Sino-Japanese Relations.

The conference decided to cooperate with all merchants and people from all walks of life in order to strive for the conclusion of an intergovernmental trade agreement with China.

Many businessmen who spoke at the conference called for the realization of genuine friendly relations between Japan and China. They also demanded that the Japanese and Chinese people forge a militant friendship to fight against obstacles hindering the establishment of friendly relations.

The businessmen fiercely criticized Japanese Prime Minister Ikeda's slanderous remarks that "China is using trade as bait to deceive the Japanese people."

The conference read a congratulatory telegram from the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade.
