Xinhua News Agency, Colombo, September 2nd. The Ceylon Senate unanimously passed the government's policy statement last night. When concluding the debate on the government's policies, Prime Minister Bandaranaike stated that the government would pursue a middle-of-the-road policy. She said that Ceylon's Catholic Action Movement opposed her party in the last election. However, the vast majority of Catholics voted for her party, which shows that they agree with the government's policy of taking over aided schools. In view of some government officials opposing the government's policies, Mrs. Bandaranaike called on all government civil servants to cooperate with the government for the benefit of the country, and she warned that the government would take strict action against obstacles.

    锡兰参议院通过政府政策声明
    新华社科伦坡2日电　锡兰参议院昨天晚上一致通过了政府的政策声明。总理班达拉奈克夫人在结束对政府政策的辩论时说，政府将奉行中间路线的政策。她说，锡兰的天主教行动运动在上次选举中反对她的党。但是，绝大多数天主教徒投她的党的票，这表明他们同意政府接管受津贴的学校的政策。鉴于一些政府官员反对政府的政策，班达拉奈克夫人呼吁所有政府的公务人员为国家的利益而同政府合作，她警告说，政府对障碍将采取严厉的行动。
