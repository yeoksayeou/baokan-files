Xinhua News Agency, Hefei, 30th - The workers of Huainan Xinzhuangzi Coal Mine are focusing on increasing the coal recovery rate in coal production, which has significantly increased coal production for the country. In the first half of this year, they raised the average recovery rate of the entire mine to 87.4%. From July to August 20, the average recovery rate further increased to 88.6%. Compared with the prescribed recovery rate targets, they have increased coal production for the country by nearly 50,000 tons since the beginning of this year.

	Determining different coal mining methods based on the geological coal seam changes is an important way for Xinzhuangzi Mine to improve the recovery rate. According to the different characteristics of the coal seams, they adopted a method of jointly deploying roadways to reduce the coal pillars between mining areas and stages, thereby greatly increasing the recovery rate. This mine also established a special geological survey team to continuously conduct geological surveys and coal exploration work on the mining faces, targeting factors that may cause coal loss. When they encountered complex geological changes, they formulated technical measures to supervise rational mining and made technical appraisals of geologically changing areas and some thin coal seams. When encountering thick coal seams with changes along the strike and dip directions, they strengthened coal exploration work to clarify the thickness of the coal seams, determine reasonable mining heights, and avoid resource losses.

	The mine has also established a strict management system to strengthen on-site management of coal mining and transportation to reduce losses during the mining and transportation process. In order to reduce mining losses, the mine specially established a residual coal inspection team, adopting a method that combines general inspection with key inspection to ensure rational mining. In order to clear and transport the residual coal from the mining faces, the mine's Party committee also made a decision that "residual coal must be cleared, no residual coal is allowed to remain, and no support pillars are allowed to be retracted if residual coal remains"; the workers conscientiously implemented this resolution and tried every means to clear and transport residual coal. Many mining teams also improved the coal mining procedures, mining and transporting coal from top to bottom, cleaning up the residual coal on the working face section by section, overcoming the problem that the residual coal in the lower section could not be cleared in the past.

	Currently, the mine's workers are continuing to work hard to improve the recovery rate, in order to produce more coal to support steel production.

    根据煤层情况确定采煤方法
    新庄孜矿大力提高回采率
    今年以来已经增产煤炭近五万吨
    新华社合肥30日电　淮南新庄孜煤矿职工大抓煤炭生产的回采率，为国家增产了大量的煤炭。他们在今年上半年，把全矿平均回采率提高到了87.4％，7月到8月20日的平均回采率又提高到88.6％；同规定的回采率指标比较，他们今年以来已经为国家增产了近五万吨煤炭。
    根据地质煤层变化情况确定不同采煤方法，是新庄孜矿提高回采率的重要途径。他们根据煤层不同的特点，采取联合部署巷道的办法，减少了采区之间和阶段之间的煤柱，从而大大提高了回采率。这个矿还针对可能丢煤的因素，专门成立了地质调查小组，不断对采掘工作面进行地质调查和探煤工作。他们遇到地质变化复杂的地方，就拟定监督合理开采的技术措施，并且对地质变化地带及一些薄煤层作出技术鉴定；遇到厚煤层沿走向和倾斜方向有变化的煤层，就加强探煤工作，以搞清煤层厚薄，确定合理采高，避免资源的损失。
    这个矿还建立严格管理制度，加强采煤和运煤的现场管理，以减少采、运过程中的损耗。为了降低开采损失，矿上专门成立了遗煤检查小组，采取一般检查和重点检查相结合的方法，保证合理开采。为了把采煤工作面的遗煤攉净运出，矿党委还作出了“遗煤不攉净，不准遗溜子，不准回柱”的决定；广大职工认真地执行了这项决议，多方设法做到了遗煤攉净运出，许多采煤队还改进了采煤程序，作到由上往下采煤和运煤，把工作面上的遗煤节节清理干净，克服了过去下段遗煤无法攉净的毛病。
    目前，全矿职工正在继续努力提高回采率，以增产更多的煤炭支援钢铁生产。
