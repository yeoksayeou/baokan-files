　　Adapting to the New Situation Requires New Leadership Methods
　　——Yongji County Promotes the Experience of "Taking Grain as the Key Link, Using Red Flag High-Yield Teams as the Focal Point, and Closely Integrating Production Development, Living Arrangements, and Political Ideological Work"
　　Yu Yifu, Secretary of the Secretariat of the Jilin Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China
    Under the guidance of the three red flags of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Communes, and under the leadership of the higher-level Party committees, agricultural production in Yongji County, Jilin Province, has achieved a continuous two-year Great Leap Forward. Grain production in 1958 increased by 13.8% compared to 1957, and in 1959 increased by another 14% compared to 1958. In the past two years, Yongji County Party Committee has adopted methods such as vigorously developing experimental fields, conducting regular field consultations, establishing model pacesetters, promoting laggards, and launching red commune member movements, accumulating a wealth of experience in leading agricultural production.
    Although agricultural production in Yongji County has greatly improved, the current average per capita grain availability in the county is only over 1,100 jin, and the average yield per mu is only over 300 jin, still far from the targets of the National Agricultural Development Program. In order to develop agricultural production more rapidly, especially grain production, it is necessary to further establish the idea that "agriculture is the foundation of the national economy, and grain is the foundation of the foundation" among cadres and masses, and resolutely implement the policy of "taking grain as the key link." The most important aspect of implementing this policy is to strengthen the leadership of production teams (i.e., production brigades, the same below). Therefore, on the basis of summarizing the leadership experience of two consecutive years of the Great Leap Forward, the County Party Committee proposed the leadership method of "taking grain as the key link, using red flag high-yield teams as the focal point, and closely integrating production development, living arrangements, and political ideological work." After the implementation of this method, great results have been achieved, and this year's spring plowing and summer hoeing production has been better than any previous year. The county's grain production and forestry, animal husbandry, sideline production, and fishery production have all shown a new leap forward.
    Leading Cadres Go to the Forefront
    The production team is the grassroots unit of the rural people's commune that specifically implements the Party's line, principles, and policies, and completes various production and work tasks. It is the direct organizer of mass production and life. In order to conscientiously implement the policy of "taking agriculture as the foundation," the Yongji County Party Committee further improved its leadership style and methods, requiring leading cadres at all levels to go deep into the forefront of production and focus on strengthening the leadership of production teams. The County Party Committee decided to launch a million-mu high-yield field movement with the participation of thousands of cadres. The main cadres of the county, commune, and management area (including various departments) must regularly go deep into a production team, eating, living, working, and consulting with commune members, so that the unit area yield of this team reaches 400 jin, 500 jin, or 800 jin respectively, according to local conditions, and use the experience of this production team to guide overall work. The County Party Committee Secretary, the First Secretary of the Commune Party Committee, and the Secretary of the Management Area Branch must each go deep into a backward production team, and after a period of work, make this team a red flag high-yield team, and use the experience of this team to guide the work of other teams. They call this the command team of the three-level secretaries. In order to make the broad masses of cadres more consciously use this leadership method, in addition to repeatedly explaining to cadres the important significance of strengthening the leadership of production teams in the new situation of socialist construction, the County Party Committee also launched cadres at all levels to examine problems in past leadership methods and leadership styles, improve everyone's understanding, and make everyone generally go deep into the forefront. A total of more than 3,400 cadres from the First Secretary of the County Party Committee to the members of the Management Area Branch went deep into more than 1,300 production teams (accounting for 72% of the total number of production teams in the county), of which 230 production teams were red flag high-yield teams contracted by the County Party Committee Secretary, the First Secretary of the Commune Party Committee, and the Secretary of the Management Area Branch, and the rest were high-yield teams contracted by general cadres. After these cadres went deep into the production teams, they ate, lived, worked, and consulted with the commune members, participated in production and led production, effectively guided production, and strengthened the relationship between cadres and the masses.
    The cadres who go deep into the production teams should help the production teams establish and improve the leadership core. From the beginning of the year to the present, all communes and management areas in the county have dispatched and adjusted 1,667 production team leaders, and have generally rectified the team committees, so that each production team has a strong leadership core. Most of the members of these leadership cores are activists from poor and lower-middle peasants. They listen to the Party, resolutely implement the Party's policies and guidelines, consult with the masses on matters, and closely contact the broad masses. In practical work, county, commune, and management area cadres offer suggestions, improve their leadership level, help them do a good job in political and ideological work, fully mobilize the masses, do a good job in democratic management, formulate small-stage plans, and rationally arrange labor. In the later period of field management, the Wulihe Commune Party Committee decided to take weeding as the center to drive other work. However, the No. 2 Team of the Baimafu Management Area organized the main labor force to go to the mountains to collect yellow grass because it was also the season for collecting yellow grass at that time. After the First Secretary of the Commune Party Committee discovered this, he helped them transfer the main labor force to the grain production front, and also appropriately arranged the labor force for grass cutting, so that the production team clarified the central task and improved the leadership level.
    The county, commune, and management area cadres who went deep into the production teams also adopted the method of combining points and surfaces and grasping both ends to lead the middle, strengthening the guidance for overall work. All tasks are carried out one step at a time by the red flag high-yield team, and then the experience of this production team is used to guide overall work. For some tasks with a strong time limit, the method of simultaneous comprehensive mobilization is adopted, and in the process of work, the red flag high-yield team is still used as the focal point to systematically study problems, summarize experiences, and guide overall work. In addition, they also regularly go deep into other teams to understand the situation and grasp the weak links. The County Party Committee Secretary and the Commune Party Committee Secretary spend one-third of their time in the countryside working in the red flag high-yield team, one-third of their time grasping weak teams, and one-third of their time conducting comprehensive inspections. The Secretary of the Management Area Branch spends seven days every ten days working in the red flag high-yield team and three days inspecting and studying work, holding meetings, or studying on the surface. In order to timely disseminate the experience of the red flag high-yield team and guide overall work, the county, commune, and management area leading cadres adopted the method of "seeing, transmitting, and leading." "Seeing" means meticulous inspection and field consultation; "transmitting" means disseminating experience through telephones, radios, newspapers, documents, and other forms; "leading" means bringing the experience from the points to other teams. From the spring of this year to the present, the county has promoted 44 advanced experiences created by the red flag high-yield team, such as timely early planting, which has played a great guiding role in the comprehensive implementation of the Eight-Point Charter for Agriculture.
    A more important achievement made by all the cadres in the county after going deep into the production teams is the change in the face of the backward production teams. Originally, there were 220 backward production teams in the county. This year, the county, commune, and management area three-level secretaries settled in these production teams, strengthened specific leadership, mobilized the masses, established and improved the leadership core, and carried out the struggle between the two roads, which has rapidly changed the face of these teams. Now, 141 backward production teams in the county have changed their backward outlook and become red flag high-yield teams, and the remaining 79 backward production teams have also undergone certain changes.
          Rational Arrangement of Labor Force
    After Yongji County universally and deeply implemented the policy of simultaneously pursuing multiple planting and multiple harvesting with high yield and multiple harvesting, and the Eight-Point Charter for Agriculture, the amount of labor used in agricultural production increased. It is estimated that this year's labor input will increase by more than 5.85 million workdays compared to last year. Therefore, whether the labor force is allocated appropriately will directly affect grain production. The Yongji County Party Committee took the following measures to solve this problem:
    1. Transfer the labor force saved from all aspects to the forefront of agricultural production. Since the beginning of this year, industrial, transportation, financial and trade, cultural and educational and other departments in the county have transferred more than 800 laborers to strengthen the agricultural front on the basis of reforming technology and improving labor efficiency. In addition, family members of urban workers were organized to participate in agricultural production, and some salespersons and shop assistants from financial and trade departments were assigned to production teams to help the production teams manage canteens in addition to their business operations. The Huapichang Commune adopted these methods and saved more than 100 laborers to participate in agricultural production. It has become a system for cadres of organs, enterprise employees, teachers, and students to participate in agricultural production during the busy farming season. From the beginning of the year to the present, all walks of life in the county have contributed a total of 2.9 million workdays, which has powerfully supported agricultural production.
    2. Tap labor potential, rationally use labor force, and improve labor efficiency. Through the rectification, consolidation, and development of collective welfare organizations, more than 16,000 women have been enabled to participate in agricultural production. In accordance with the principle of making the best use of talents, a group of auxiliary labor forces were also organized to participate in agricultural labor suitable for their conditions. At the same time, some production teams in the commune took the following measures to strengthen labor management: according to the different seasons, the needs of agricultural work, the strength of the labor force, and the level of technology, they divided the battle lines and flexibly used the labor force; they strengthened the planning of the use of labor force with long-term plans and short-term arrangements; they implemented the basic workday system and the small group and small section contracting system, and launched a full attendance and over-quota competition movement; they widely established models and launched a red flag hand movement. During rice transplanting in the Dahechuan Management Area of the Shuanghe Town Commune, more than 150 red flag rice transplanters were established. Driven by them, they completed the task of transplanting 5,100 mu in seven days, shortening the time by half a month compared to last year.
    3. In the use of labor force, the methods of combining professional teams and mass movements, combining year-round production and seasonal production, and combining long-term preparation and short-term blitzkriegs were adopted to concentrate superior forces to fight annihilation battles. They divide the busy farming season into three situations, namely, the small busy period, the medium busy period, and the special busy period. The field production tasks of the small busy period are completely completed by the field production team, and no other forces are mobilized; in addition to the field production team, a part of the force is organized to support the field production tasks of the medium busy period; in addition to the full efforts of the forces on the agricultural front, all that can be organized are mobilized to support the field production tasks of the special busy period, and they are completed in a blitzkrieg. From spring plowing to the present, the county has organized three large-scale campaigns.
    4. Widely mobilize the masses, and in accordance with the policy of "being indigenous if possible, being foreign if possible, combining indigenous and foreign, and being indigenous first and then foreign," carry out technical innovation and technical revolution movements, and vigorously carry out tool reform. From the beginning of the year to the present, several tool reform upsurges have been launched successively, such as spring plowing and sowing, summer hoeing, and autumn harvesting and threshing, and a total of 24,222 various tools have been reformed. New tools were used in the main processes such as land preparation, sowing, rice transplanting, weeding, and topdressing. The spring sowing land sown with improved agricultural tools was more than 900,000 mu, accounting for 42% of the total sown area; the paddy fields transplanted with rice transplanters were 37,500 mu, accounting for about 20% of the area that should be transplanted; the first pass of land cultivated with weeding machines was more than 1,447,500 mu, accounting for 68.9% of the sown area. As a result of the tool reform, not only was labor efficiency improved, but also the quality of operations was greatly improved. In the first half of the year, the county saved more than 1.5 million labor days in the tool reform alone. At present, the county is concentrating its efforts on reforming and manufacturing autumn harvesting and threshing tools. Now, 279 threshing machines of various crops have been manufactured; at the same time, the reform of tools and the utilization of water power have been closely combined, and 181 hydropower stations have been built, striving to basically realize the mechanization and semi-mechanization of autumn harvesting and threshing this year. After taking the above-mentioned series of measures, the labor force needed for agricultural production is basically guaranteed.
      Grasp Life to Promote Production
    In order to fully mobilize the enthusiasm of the broad masses of commune members and ensure the high-speed development of grain production, the Yongji County Party Committee grasped the work related to the people's lives while grasping production, especially the work of public canteens. The three-level secretaries personally used the canteen of the red flag production team as a point to guide the overall situation, helping the canteens to continuously rectify and improve, and improve the democratic management system, so that the canteens are getting better and better. While strengthening organizational leadership, the Yongji County Party Committee also paid great attention to vegetable production. From preparation for farming to the present, cadres at all levels have helped production teams expand the area of vegetable fields by more than 225,000 mu through the methods of "multiple cropping, intercropping, and picking and planting" without reducing the area of grain planting, an increase of about 30% compared to last year. After taking these measures, the face of the canteens has been greatly changed, the supply of vegetables is sufficient, and the commune members are very satisfied.
    While consolidating and improving public canteens, other welfare undertakings have also been developed, enabling more than 16,000 women to get rid of tedious housework and participate in production.
    In order to ensure that commune members have sufficient rest time in the tense labor and achieve a combination of work and rest, in addition to the implementation of a regular vacation system, some necessary meetings are also moved to the fields, and no meetings are held in the evening. Proper arrangements have also been made for the household affairs of commune members. During the hoe-hanging period, each production team gives commune members a certain amount of time to collect firewood, build houses, plaster walls, and dig stoves.
    Through the comprehensive organization and arrangement of the lives of commune members, the labor enthusiasm of the broad masses of commune members has been greatly stimulated, and production has been promoted. Due to the comprehensive arrangement of the lives of commune members, the attendance and labor efficiency of commune members in Wulihe Commune have generally improved; the attendance rate has reached an average of over 95%, which is about 10% higher than last year, and the labor efficiency has generally increased by 10%-15%.
      Arm the People with Mao Zedong Thought
    The new task of accelerating agricultural development requires faster improvement of the ideological awareness of the broad masses, promoting the communist style of daring to think and act and being selfless, and overcoming the influence of capitalist ideas and old habits. Therefore, the Yongji County Party Committee has adhered to the principle of putting politics in command and strengthening political and ideological work in all tasks. In political and ideological work, taking the study of Comrade Mao Zedong's works as the central content, four methods were used: First, in combination with the current practical work and the ideological situation of the masses, the County Party Committee uniformly compiled and printed study materials, which were taught level by level, and the County, Commune, and Management Area three-level secretaries personally took charge, taking the production team as a unit, to explain the spiritual essence of Chairman Mao's works to the commune members in a simple and planned way. Second, using local advanced figures and advanced deeds to carry out socialist and communist ideological education for commune members; deeply launching the red commune member and red family movement to improve the awareness of the masses. Third, organizing commune members to conduct airing of views and debates, carrying out the struggle between the two roads, so that commune members can clarify the major issues in rural areas. Fourth, launching "five networks" activities. The "five networks" are the propaganda network, the newspaper reading network, the cultural network, the science and technology network, and the theory learning network. At present, studying Comrade Mao Zedong's works has formed a hot trend in the county. Because the explanations are simple and related to the actual situation in rural areas, the masses do not feel that Comrade Mao Zedong's theoretical works are profound and difficult to understand; many masses can immediately apply what they have learned to practical work after studying.
    Combining the study of Comrade Mao Zedong's works, vigorously commending advanced figures and disseminating advanced deeds, and carrying out socialist and communist education for the broad masses of commune members, the new fashion of commune members loving the country, loving the collective, and being selfless has greatly grown. Last winter, when Huapichang Commune was threshing, the threshing ground accidentally caught fire, and tens of thousands of kilograms of grain and machines were in danger of being burned immediately. Red commune member Wang Qingxiang discovered the fire and unhesitatingly drilled into the fire net, rushing to save the machines and transport oil drums regardless of his own safety. As a result, the machines and oil drums were rescued, and the grain was also saved. However, Comrade Wang Qingxiang unfortunately died due to severe burns. The County Party Committee erected a monument for Comrade Wang Qingxiang and publicized his heroic deeds throughout the county. Under the influence of Comrade Wang Qingxiang's heroic deeds, examples of selflessness and public service emerged one after another. One night during the summer hoeing season this year, it rained heavily in Wulihezi, and commune member Yu Jingchun was worried that the dam would burst. He got up from the kang and went to check the dam in the dark. He found that the dam was leaking and there was a danger of breaching. It was too late to go back to the village to find someone, so he repaired it alone in the rain, working all night and saving 165 mu of paddy fields from floods. There are really countless similar vivid model examples. At present, the number of red commune members in the county has increased from 20,600 at the beginning of the year to 25,760, and the number of activists who are both red and expert has increased from 860 to more than 1,500. Most of the more than 1,000 new Party members admitted in the first half of this year are red commune members.

    适应新的形势要有新的领导方法
　　——永吉县推行“以粮为纲，以红旗高产队为点，把发展生产、安排生活和政治思想工作密切结合起来”的领导方法的经验
　　中共吉林省委书记处书记　于毅夫
    吉林省永吉县的农业生产，在总路线、大跃进、人民公社三面红旗的照耀下和上级党委的领导下，获得了连续两年的大跃进。粮食产量1958年比1957年增加13.8％，1959年比1958年又增加了14％。两年来，永吉县委采取了大搞试验田，定期进行田间大会诊、树标兵、促后进，开展红色社员运动等方法，在领导农业生产上积累了许多经验。
    永吉县的农业生产虽然大大提高了，但目前全县每人平均还只有粮食一千一百多斤，每亩平均产量只有三百多斤，距离全国农业发展纲要的指标还很远。为了更迅速地发展农业生产，特别是更迅速地发展粮食生产，必须进一步在干部和群众中明确树立“农业是国民经济的基础，粮食是基础的基础”的思想，坚决贯彻“以粮为纲”的方针；而要贯彻这一方针，最主要的环节是加强生产队（即生产小队，下同）的领导。因此，县委在总结两年连续跃进的领导经验的基础上，提出了“以粮为纲，以红旗高产队为点，把发展生产、安排生活和政治思想工作密切结合起来”的领导方法。这个方法实行以后，取得了很大效果，今年春耕和夏锄生产比以往任何一年搞得都好。全县的粮食生产和林、牧、副、渔业生产都呈现了新的跃进局面。
    领导干部亲临第一线
    生产队是农村人民公社具体执行党的路线、方针、政策和完成各项生产与工作任务的基层单位，是群众生产和生活的直接组织者。永吉县委为了认真贯彻“以农业为基础”的方针，进一步改进了领导作风和领导方法，要求各级主要干部都深入生产第一线，重点加强生产队的领导。县委决定开展千名干部参加的百万亩高产田运动。县、公社、管理区（包括各部门）的主要干部必须常年深入到一个生产队，和社员同吃、同住、同劳动、同商量，使这个队的单位面积产量根据当地情况分别达到四百斤、五百斤或八百斤，并且以这个生产队的经验指导全面工作。县委书记、公社党委第一书记和管理区支部书记，要各自深入到一个后进生产队，经过一段时期的工作，使这个队成为红旗高产队，用这个队的经验指导其他队的工作。他们把这叫做三级书记的指挥队。为了使广大干部更自觉地运用这种领导方法，县委除了反复向干部说明在社会主义建设新形势下加强生产队领导的重要意义外，还发动各级干部检查过去领导方法和领导作风中的问题，提高大家的认识，使大家普遍深入第一线。全县从县委第一书记到管理区支部委员，共有三千四百多名干部深入到一千三百多个生产队（占全县生产队总数的72％），其中有二百三十个生产队是县委书记、公社党委第一书记和管理区支部书记包干的红旗高产队，其余是一般干部包干的高产队。这些干部深入生产队以后，和社员同吃、同住、同劳动、同商量，参加生产领导生产，有力地指导了生产，密切了干部与群众的关系。
    深入生产队的干部，要帮助生产队建立与健全领导核心。从年初到现在，全县各公社和管理区共下派和调整了一千六百六十七名生产队长，并且普遍整顿了队委会，使各生产队有了坚强的领导核心。这些领导核心的成员大部分是贫农和下中农的积极分子，他们听党的话，坚决贯彻执行党的方针政策，有事同群众商量，密切联系广大群众。在实际工作中，县、社、管理区干部为他们出谋划策，提高他们的领导水平，帮助他们作好政治思想工作，充分发动群众，搞好民主管理，制订小段计划，合理安排劳动力。五里河公社在田间管理的后期，党委决定以灭草为中心带动其他工作。可是，白马夫管理区第二队却因当时也是打黄草的季节，队委会就把主要劳力组织上山打黄草。公社党委第一书记发现后，帮助他们把主要劳动力转移到粮食生产战线上来，同时也适当安排了打草的劳动力，这样就使生产队明确了中心任务，提高了领导水平。
    深入生产队的县、公社、管理区干部还采取了点面结合与抓两头带中间的方法，加强了对全面工作的指导。各项工作都是红旗高产队先走一步，再运用这个生产队的经验来指导全面工作。有些时间性较强的工作，则采取全面发动同时进行的方法，而在工作过程中仍以红旗高产队为点，系统地研究问题，总结经验，指导全面。此外，他们还定期深入其他队了解情况，抓薄弱环节。县委书记和公社党委书记在下乡的时间里，有三分之一的时间在红旗高产队工作，三分之一的时间抓薄弱队，三分之一的时间进行全面巡回检查。管理区支部书记在每十天里，有七天在红旗高产队工作，三天在面上巡回检查、研究工作、开会或学习。县、公社、管理区领导干部为了及时传播红旗高产队的经验，指导全面工作，采取了“看、传、带”的办法。“看”，就是细致检查，田间会诊；“传”，就是通过电话、广播、报纸、文件等形式，传播经验；“带”，就是把点里的经验带到其它队去。从今年春季到现在，全县共推广了红旗高产队所创造的适时早种等四十四项先进经验，对全面贯彻农业八字宪法起了很大的指导作用。
    全县干部深入生产队以后取得的更重要的一项成绩，是改变了后进生产队的面貌。原来全县有二百二十个后进生产队，今年县、公社、管理区三级书记到这些生产队落户，加强了具体领导，发动了群众，建立与健全了领导核心，开展了两条道路的斗争，已经使这些队的面貌迅速改观。现在全县已有一百四十一个后进生产队改变了落后面貌，变成了红旗高产队，其余的七十九个后进生产队也发生了一定变化。
          合理安排劳动力
    永吉县在普遍深入贯彻多种多收与高产多收同时并举的方针和农业八字宪法以后，农业生产的用工量增加了。据估计今年的用工量比去年增加五百八十五万多个工日。因此，劳动力调配得是否适当，将直接影响到粮食生产。永吉县委采取了如下措施来解决这一问题：
    一、把各方面节约下来的劳动力，调到农业生产第一线。今年以来，全县工业、交通、财贸、文教等部门，在改革技术、提高劳动效率的基础上，先后调出八百多名劳动力增强了农业战线。此外，还组织了城镇职工家属参加农业生产，并把财贸部门的部分营业员、售货员下放到生产队，除经营业务外，还帮助生产队搞好食堂。桦皮厂公社采取这些办法，节省了一百多名劳动力参加农业生产。农忙时，机关干部、企业职工、教师和学生参加农业生产劳动，已经形成制度。从年初到现在，全县各行各业共出了二百九十万个工日，有力地支援了农业生产。
    二、挖掘劳动潜力，合理使用劳动力，提高劳动效率。经过整顿、巩固、发展集体福利事业组织，使一万六千多名妇女参加了农业生产。本着人尽其才的原则，还组织了一批辅助劳动力参加了适合于他们的情况的农业劳动。同时，一些公社的生产队为了加强劳动管理，采取了如下办法：根据季节的不同，农活的需要，劳动力的强弱，技术高低，划分战线，灵活使用劳动力；长计划短安排，加强使用劳动力的计划性；实行基本劳动日制和小组小段包工制，开展满勤超定额竞赛运动；广树标兵，开展红旗手运动。双河镇公社大河川管理区插秧中树立了红旗插秧手一百五十多名，在他们的带动下，七天完成五千一百亩插秧任务，比去年缩短了半个月。
    三、在劳动力使用上，采取了专业队伍和群众运动相结合，常年生产和季节生产相结合，长期准备和短期突击相结合的方法，集中优势兵力打歼灭战。他们把农忙分为三种情况，即小忙期、中忙期和特忙期。小忙期的田间生产任务，完全依靠田间生产队完成，不动员其它方面的力量；中忙期的田间生产任务，除田间生产队外，还组织一部分力量来支援；特忙期的田间生产任务，除了农业战线的力量全力以赴外，还进行全民动员，组织一切可以组织的力量支援，突击完成。从春耕到现在，全县共组织了三次大规模战役。
    四、广泛发动群众，根据“能土就土，能洋就洋，土洋结合，先土后洋”的方针，开展技术革新和技术革命运动，大搞工具改革。从年初到现在，先后掀起春耕播种、夏锄和秋收脱谷等几次工具改革高潮，共改革各种工具两万四千二百二十二件。整地、播种、插秧、除草、追肥等主要工序，都使用了新工具，使用改良农具播种的春播地有九十多万亩，占播种面积总数的42％；使用插秧机插秧的稻田有三万七千五百亩，占应插秧面积的20％左右；用锄草机铲的头遍地共一百四十四万七千五百多亩，占播种面积68.9％。改革工具的结果，不仅提高了劳动效率，而且也大大提高了作业质量。上半年全县仅工具改革一项就节省了一百五十多万个劳动日。目前全县正集中力量突击改革和制造秋收脱谷工具，现在已造出二百七十九台各种作物脱粒机；同时还把改革工具和利用水力密切结合起来，建成了一百八十一处水动力站，力争今年秋收脱谷基本实现机械化和半机械化。采取上述一系列措施后，基本上保证了农业生产所需要的劳动力。
      抓好生活　促进生产
    为了充分调动广大社员的劳动积极性，保证高速度发展粮食生产，永吉县委在抓生产的同时，还抓了有关群众生活的工作，特别是公共食堂工作。三级书记都亲自以红旗生产队的食堂为点来指导全面，帮助各食堂不断地进行整顿提高，健全民主管理制度，使食堂越办越好。在加强组织领导的同时，永吉县委还大抓特抓蔬菜生产。从备耕到现在，各级干部帮助生产队通过“复种、间种、拣种”的办法，在不减少粮食播种面积的原则下，又扩大菜田面积二十二万五千多亩，比去年增加30％左右。采取这些措施以后，食堂面貌大大改观，蔬菜供应充足，社员非常满意。
    在巩固与提高公共食堂的同时，还发展了其他福利事业，使一万六千多名妇女摆脱繁琐的家务劳动，参加了生产。
    为了保证社员在紧张的劳动中有充分的休息时间，做到劳逸结合，除了实行定期休假制度外，还把一些必要的会议挪到田间开，晚间不开会。对于社员家务事也做了妥善安排。挂锄期间，各生产队都给社员一定的打柴、盖房、抹墙和掏炕的时间。
    通过全面组织与安排社员生活，大大激发了广大社员的劳动热情，促进了生产。五里河公社由于全面地安排好了社员生活，社员的出勤和劳动效率普遍提高了；出勤率平均达到95％以上，比去年高10％左右，劳动效率一般提高10％—15％。
      用毛泽东思想武装人民群众
    加速农业发展的新任务，要求更快地提高广大群众的思想觉悟，发扬敢想敢干和大公无私的共产主义风格，克服资本主义思想的影响和旧的习惯势力。因此，永吉县委在各项工作中，都坚持了政治挂帅，加强了政治思想工作。在政治思想工作中，以学习毛泽东同志的著作为中心内容，运用了四种方法：一，结合当前实际工作和群众思想情况，由县委统一编印学习材料，逐级进行传授，并由县、公社、管理区三级书记亲自挂帅，以生产队为单位，通俗地、有计划地向社员讲解毛主席著作的精神实质。二，运用本地先进人物、先进事迹向社员进行社会主义、共产主义思想教育；深入开展红色社员和红色家庭运动，提高群众觉悟。三，组织社员进行鸣放辩论，开展两条道路的斗争，使社员明确农村中的大是大非。四，开展“五网”活动。“五网”即宣传网、读报网、文化网、科学技术网、理论学习网。目前学习毛泽东同志的著作已在全县形成了热潮。由于讲解通俗，又联系农村的实际情况，群众对于毛泽东同志的理论著作，并不感觉到高深难解；不少群众在学习了以后，马上就能把学到的东西运用到实际工作中去。
    结合学习毛泽东同志的著作，大力表扬先进人物和传播先进事迹，向广大社员进行社会主义、共产主义教育，使社员热爱国家、热爱集体、舍己为公的新风尚大大成长起来。桦皮厂公社，去年冬天打场时，场院不慎起火，几万斤粮食和机器有立即被烧毁的危险。红色社员王庆祥发现起火，就毫不犹豫地钻入火网，奋不顾身地抢救机器，搬运油筒。结果机器和油筒抢出来了，也保住了粮食，但是，王庆祥同志因被火烧伤过重，不幸牺牲了。县委为王庆祥同志立了纪念碑，并将他的英勇事迹在全县范围内进行宣传。在王庆祥同志英勇事迹的影响下，舍己为公的事例层出不穷。今年夏锄期间的一天晚上，五里河子下大雨，社员于景春耽心水坝决口，从炕上爬起来摸黑去检查水坝，发现水坝漏水，有决口的危险，想回村找人已来不及，他就一个人冒雨抢修，整整忙了一夜，使一百六十五亩稻田免受水灾。类似这些生动的模范事例，真是不胜枚举。目前，全县的红色社员已经由年初的二万零六百人，增加到二万五千七百六十人，其中又红又专的积极分子，由八百六十人增加到一千五百多人。今年上半年吸收的一千多名新党员中，绝大部分是红色社员。
