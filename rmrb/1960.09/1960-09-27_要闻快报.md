　　Check Seedlings and Replenish Seedlings for Early Sown Wheat

　　After completing the task of sowing regular wheat crops, the communes in Fenyang County, Shanxi Province, immediately launched a mass movement to check and replenish seedlings.

　　In this autumn sowing season, the communes in Fenyang County conscientiously implemented the spirit of "sowing more and sowing well," and completed the plan for sowing regular wheat crops on September 15th in a timely manner. In order to ensure that these wheat seedlings are full and eliminate the phenomenon of missing seedlings and broken ridges, the communes have sent inspection teams to conduct detailed inspections of the emergence of wheat seedlings in mountainous areas, plains, irrigated land, and dry land.

　　In response to the problem of missing seedlings and broken ridges in a small number of wheat fields, the communes immediately organized more than 7,000 members to launch a movement to check and replenish seedlings, striving to plant every seedling.

　　Plan Early Rice Seedling Fields Early

　　Shanzao Commune in Xiangxiang County, Hunan Province, planned early, prepared early, and started early, and has planned and implemented all 3,200 mu of early rice seedling fields for the whole commune next year to groups and plots, with signs inserted in each plot to ensure that responsibility is assigned to each person.

　　After the overall planning and implementation of the seedling fields, the whole commune immediately launched a new upsurge of planting autumn vegetables and green manure on a large scale. The commune decided to plant radishes and Chinese cabbage on all 3,200 mu of seedling fields. Currently, 650 mu of seedling fields have been planted with radishes, and 224 mu have been planted with Chinese cabbage. This can not only increase vegetable production, but also fertilize the bottom of the seedling fields.

　　Guangxi Applies Late Rice Panicle Fertilizer on a Large Scale

　　Late rice in Guangxi has generally reached the panicle stage. Various regions are seizing the favorable opportunity to focus on the panicle stage to ensure uniform heading and full grains, striving to increase the yield of late rice.

　　After the seedlings have jointed and reached the panicle stage, it is the period when rice needs the most nutrients during its entire growth period. Before tackling the panicle stage, various regions generally summarized the experience of increasing production by applying panicle fertilizer in previous years, which greatly stimulated the enthusiasm of the masses to apply panicle fertilizer.

　　In the movement to apply panicle fertilizer on a large scale, thousands of cadres, technicians, and masses in the autonomous region converged on the fields to conduct detailed research on the seedlings plot by plot, master the timing of fertilization, and strive to use "steel on the blade."

　　Sichuan Sows Rapeseed Early in a Timely Manner

　　Various regions in Sichuan conscientiously summarized and applied the high-yield experience of sowing rapeseed early in a timely manner and sowed rapeseed in advance. At present, some of the earlier sown rapeseed seedlings are already five or six inches deep, showing a lush green.

　　The experience of increasing rapeseed production in Sichuan over the years proves that timely early sowing can make full use of the favorable conditions of high temperature and strong sunshine in autumn, accumulate more nutrients, and promote more branches, more pods, and more seeds in rapeseed. This year, various regions in Sichuan generally began preparing for sowing as early as the end of the summer heat. Zhong County, a high-yield rapeseed county, has completed all rapeseed sowing, generally achieving deep plowing and soil drying, using improved varieties, and applying sufficient fertilizer. Many places have also adopted methods such as intercropping, overlapping planting, and mixed planting to expand the rapeseed planting area as much as possible.

　　Qinghai Strengthens Autumn Vegetable Management

　　This year, the autumn vegetable sowing area in Qinghai Province has more than doubled compared to last year. Most people's communes and state-owned farms have sown an average of more than five fen of autumn vegetables per person, and the variety of vegetables has also greatly increased. In order to increase the production of more autumn vegetables, while concentrating the main labor force to rush the autumn harvest and threshing, various regions are arranging a certain amount of labor force to carefully manage the large areas of vegetable fields sown collectively; for the autumn vegetables sown by commune members using scattered open spaces, they are mobilizing commune members to manage them during their spare time.

　　Now, the early-sown autumn vegetables in the early-maturing areas in the east have begun to be harvested. While rushing to harvest, various regions are vigorously engaged in the processing and storage of vegetables.

    要闻快报
    为早播小麦查苗补苗
    山西汾阳县各公社在完成正茬小麦播种任务以后，立即掀起了群众性的查苗补苗运动。
    汾阳县各公社在今年秋种中，由于认真贯彻了多种、种好的精神，在九月十五日就适时完成了播种正茬小麦的计划。为了保证这些小麦苗全垅满，消灭缺苗断垅现象，各公社都派出了检查组，分别对山地、平川、水地、旱地的麦苗出土情况进行了细致的检查。
    针对小部分小麦缺苗断垅问题，各公社立即组织了七千多名社员，展开随查随补，株苗必争的查苗补苗运动。
    及早规划明年早稻秧田
    湖南省湘乡县山枣公社早规划、早准备、早动手，把全社明年三千二百亩早稻秧田全部规划落实到组、到丘、丘丘插上了牌子，做到责任到人。
    秧田全面规划落实以后，全社立即掀起了一个大种秋菜、大种绿肥的新高潮。公社决定将三千二百亩秧田全部种上萝卜、白菜，现已有六百五十亩秧田种上萝卜，二百二十四亩栽上白菜。这样，既可多收蔬菜，还种肥了秧田底子。
    广西大施晚稻孕穗肥
    广西晚稻已普遍孕穗，各地正抓紧有利时机猛攻孕穗关，保证抽穗整齐，谷粒饱满，力争晚稻增产。
    禾苗拔节孕穗以后，是水稻整个生长期需要养料最多的时期。各地在攻孕穗关以前，普遍总结往年施孕穗肥增产的经验，从而大大激发了群众施孕穗肥的积极性。
    在大施孕穗肥运动中，自治区成千上万的干部、技术员、群众会师田头，对禾苗逐块进行细致研究，掌握施肥火候，力求把“钢用在刀刃上”。
    四川适时早播油菜
    四川各地认真总结运用油菜适时早播的高产经验，提早播种油菜。目前，部分播种较早的油菜已苗深五六寸，一片嫩绿。
    四川历年油菜增产经验证明：适时早播可以充分利用秋季气温高、日照强的有利条件，多积营养物质，促使油菜多分枝、多结荚、多结籽。今年四川各地早在处暑前后即普遍进行播种准备。油菜高产县忠县的油菜已经全部播完，一般都做到深耕烘土，采用良种和施足肥料。许多地方还采取间种套种和混种等办法，尽量扩大油菜种植面积。
    青海加强秋菜管理
    今年青海省各地的秋菜播种面积比去年扩大了两倍多，大多数人民公社和国营农牧场平均每人播种的秋菜都在五分地以上，蔬菜的品种也大大增加。为了增产更多的秋菜，各地都在集中主要劳力突击秋收、打碾的同时，安排一定数量的劳力精心管理集体播种的大片菜地；对于公社社员利用零星空地播种的秋菜，都发动社员利用工余时间进行管理。
    现在，东部早熟地区早播的秋菜已经开始收获，各地在抢收的同时，大搞蔬菜的加工、贮备。
