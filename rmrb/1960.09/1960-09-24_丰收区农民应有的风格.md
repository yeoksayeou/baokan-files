Local Newspaper Commentary Excerpts:

　　The determination of the members of the Hanbei People's Commune in Wuxiang County to increase production, economize on everything, and save food and resources to support disaster areas is the style that all commune members in bumper harvest areas should have, according to a commentary in the Shanxi Daily.

　　What should the farmers in bumper harvest areas learn from the members of the Hanbei Commune, and what style should they establish?

　　First, a style of considering the overall situation and subordinating to the whole. What is a style of considering the overall situation and subordinating to the whole? As the members of the Hanbei Commune said, it is to "think for the 650 million people in the country." As everyone knows, our country is a large country, and in the era of reactionary rule, all aspects were very backward. In the eleven years since liberation, under the leadership of the Party, although there has been leapfrog progress in industrial and agricultural production and construction in all aspects, the face of "poverty and blankness" has not been fundamentally changed. Therefore, the people of the whole country need to work hard and practically to strive to change our country's face of "poverty and blankness" as soon as possible. The actions of the members of the Hanbei Commune in saving food and resources, selling more surplus grain, supporting national construction, and supporting disaster areas embody this style.

　　Second, a style of sharing weal and woe and sharing the same boat. What is sharing weal and woe and sharing the same boat? The members of the Qiaonan Management District of the Hanbei Commune answered this question most vividly. They said: "Last year, our management district suffered the worst disaster in twenty years. We had no way to arrange our lives after the autumn harvest. The state provided us with 720 yuan and 80,000 jin of grain to help us overcome the disaster. This year, we have a bumper harvest, but some places in the country and the province have suffered disasters. How can we only care about ourselves and not care about others? The difficulties of the people in the disaster areas are our difficulties." This is absolutely right. This year, when the whole province suffered a severe drought, under the leadership of the Party, regardless of urban or rural areas, regardless of industry, transportation, commerce, learning, or military, regardless of men, women, old, or young, everyone was involved in the fight against drought. The state transferred more than 100,000 horsepower of irrigation and drainage machinery to the countryside to support our province's fight against drought; hundreds of drilling machines from the geological department were sent to the countryside to help farmers dig wells; many factories and mines brought their own machines and equipment to build high-irrigation stations for farmers; transportation and commercial departments gave priority to the transfer of drought-resistant materials; residents, cadres, and students in cities and towns also participated in the fight against drought, thus turning a severe disaster into a light disaster, and a light disaster into no disaster. May I ask: In the bumper harvest areas and the average harvest areas, without the leadership of the Party and without the support of the whole people, how could we have achieved the good harvests we have now? When we had difficulties, we received strong support from all sides; when others have difficulties, we actively support them, which is our bounden duty. Sharing blessings and sharing disasters; one place in disaster, all sides support, this is the noble style of communism. In the large-scale economic construction that our motherland is engaged in, which our predecessors have never done before, especially in the battle with nature, difficulties are inevitable; however, we firmly believe that as long as everyone unites, shares weal and woe, the difficulties on the road ahead can be overcome.

　　Third, a style of diligence and thrift, and striving for progress. How to be diligent and thrifty, and strive for progress? In the words of Han Huze, a poor peasant commune member of the Yaoshanggou Management District of the Hanbei Commune, it is: "Life now is much better than when we had half a year of grain mixed with chaff and wild herbs in the past. We cannot 'forget the pain once the wound is healed.' When it comes to increasing production and practicing economy, I don't think there is an end to increasing production, and there is no end to practicing economy." Yes! How well said this is. The farmers in our province have lived a life of "half a year of grain mixed with chaff and wild herbs" for thousands of years. Under the leadership of the Party, they have escaped from that bitter life. Although life is gradually getting better today, how can we forget the suffering of the past? Suffering more today is for a happier future; increasing production and practicing economy more in good years can reduce difficulties in disaster years. As for whether there is potential for increasing production and practicing economy in bumper harvest areas, this is also a matter of style. Those with lofty ambitions believe that the more bumper the harvest, the greater the potential for increasing production and practicing economy, and the more there is to be done. Autumn is a golden season in agricultural activities, and it is also the best season for increasing production and practicing economy. At this time, grains are ripe, wild plants are abundant, and people can not only get more grain, cotton, oil, vegetables, etc. through careful harvesting, but also extract as much food, drink, clothing, and utensils as possible from wild plants. In autumn, especially in bumper harvest areas, grains are abundant and fruits are everywhere, and people will cause waste if they neglect it even slightly.

　　Now, the autumn harvest campaign has started one after another, and the movement to increase production and practice economy is at a decisive moment. All people's communes in all bumper harvest areas and average harvest areas should, like the Hanbei Commune, organize all commune members to discuss plans to increase production and practice economy; they should explain to all commune members the excellent situation in the whole country and the whole province, and the actual difficulties caused by the disaster; they should let commune members recall and compare, look forward and backward, and correctly handle the relationship between the interests of their own unit and the interests of the whole, the relationship between immediate interests and long-term interests; they should pool their wisdom and efforts to tap all potential for increasing production and practicing economy, formulate plans for increasing production and practicing economy, and comprehensively arrange production and life, so as to push the competition movement to increase production and practice economy centered on the "three autumns" to a climax, strive to harvest more grain, and support disaster areas, support cities, and support the country.

### 丰收区农民应有的风格

　　丰收区农民应有的风格
　　山西日报评论
    武乡县韩北人民公社的社员决定人人增产，事事节约，省吃俭用，支援灾区，是所有的丰收区社员们应有的风格。
    丰收区的农民应该向韩北公社社员们学习些什么，应该树立什么风格呢？
    一是顾全大局、服从整体的风格。什么是顾全大局、服从整体的风格呢？照韩北公社社员们所说的，那就是要“为全国六亿五千万人着想”。大家知道，我们国家是个大国，在反动统治的年代里，各方面都很落后，解放以后的十一年来，在党的领导下，虽然工农业生产和各方面的建设，都有了飞跃的进步，但是，“一穷二白”的面貌，还没有从根本上得到改变。因此，就需要全国人民发愤图强，实干苦干，争取尽快改变我国“一穷二白”的面貌。韩北公社社员们省吃俭用，多卖余粮，支援国家建设，支援灾区的举动，正体现了这种风格。
    二是患难与共、同舟共济的风格。什么叫患难与共、同舟共济呢？韩北公社乔南管理区的社员们最生动地回答了这个问题。他们说：“去年我们管理区遭受了二十年来没有过的特大灾害，秋后生活没法安排，国家救济了七百二十元钱、八万斤粮食，帮我们度过了灾荒。今年我们是个丰收年，可是全国、全省有的地方遭了灾，我们怎能光管自己，不管别人？灾区人民的困难就是我们的困难。”这话说得完全对。今年，当全省遭受严重干旱的时候，在党的领导下，地不分城乡，行不分工、交、商、学、兵，人不分男女老幼，投入了抗旱斗争；国家为了支援我省的抗旱斗争，将十万以上马力的排灌机械调往农村；地质部门的钻探机，成百部下放农村，为农民打井；许多厂矿自带机器和器材为农民修建高灌站；交通、商业部门，优先调运抗旱物资；城镇的居民、干部、学生，也参加了抗旱斗争，因而，才使重灾变轻灾，轻灾变无灾。试问：在丰收区和平收区，没有党的领导，没有全民的支援，哪能获得现在的好收成？我们有困难的时候，得到了各方面的大力支援；别人有了困难，我们积极支援，这是义不容辞的。有福同享，有灾同挡；一处有灾，八方支援，这是共产主义的高尚风格。在祖国从事前人未有的大规模的经济建设中，特别是在与自然界进行作战中，困难是不会没有的；但是，我们坚信，只要大家团结一致，患难与共，前进道路上的困难，就没有不能克服的。
    三是克勤克俭、发愤图强的风格。怎样克勤克俭、发愤图强呢？用韩北公社窑上沟管理区贫农社员韩虎则的话来说，那就是：“现在的生活比过去糠菜半年粮的时候强得多了，我们不能‘好了疮疤忘了疼’。说到增产节约，我看增产没到头，节约没到头。”是呀！这话说得多好，我省农民过了几千年
  “糠菜半年粮”的生活，在党的领导下，才摆脱了那种苦生活，今天生活虽然逐渐好起来了，但怎能忘了过去的苦呢？今天多吃点苦，是为了以后更幸福；丰年多增产多节约，灾年就可以少受困难。至于丰收区增产节约是否有搞头的问题，这也是一个风格问题。有雄心大志的人，认为越丰收，增产节约的潜力越大，越有搞头。秋季，在农事活动中是一个黄金季节，也是增产节约的最好季节。在这个时候，五谷成熟，野生植物丰盛，人们不但可以通过细收细打拿到更多的粮食、棉花、油料、蔬菜等，而且可以向野生植物索取尽多的吃、喝、穿、戴。在秋季，特别是丰收区，五谷丰盈，瓜果遍地，人们稍一忽视，就要造成浪费。
    现在，秋收运动已经陆续开始，增产节约运动正处在一个决定性的时刻。所有的丰收区、平收区的人民公社，都应当像韩北公社一样，组织全体社员讨论增产节约计划；要向全体社员讲清全国全省的大好形势，和遭受灾害的实际困难；要让社员回忆对比，瞻前顾后，正确处理本单位利益和整体利益的关系、眼前利益和长远利益的关系；要集思广益，挖掘一切增产节约潜力，制订增产节约计划和全面安排生产、生活，从而把以“三秋”为中心的增产节约竞赛运动推向高潮，力争多收粮食，支援灾区，支援城市，支援国家。
