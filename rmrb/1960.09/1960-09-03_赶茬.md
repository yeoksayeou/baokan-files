    Catching the Stubble
    Yang Ling
    Farmers in some areas call winter wheat replanted after the autumn harvest "catch stubble wheat." The word "catch" is very appropriate here.
    Catching the stubble is not just about the previous crop "catching" the next crop, but also about making the latter crop "catch" the former crop. The two crops that are replanted "catch" each other, which can most effectively utilize land and time.
    Planting autumn crops in wheat stubble fields and then planting wheat after the autumn harvest makes the time even tighter. This requires better and earlier preparation for wheat planting. Preparations for autumn planting should be done as early as possible, which can not only reduce the concentration of farm work during the autumn harvest but also allow plowing and wheat planting immediately after the autumn harvest.
    Planting wheat in autumn stubble fields inevitably requires autumn crops to mature and be harvested earlier, which requires faster and better post-management of autumn fields. Early maturing and harvesting of autumn crops can not only reduce unfilled and empty grains and avoid frost damage but also facilitate timely and early planting of winter wheat.
    There are contradictions between the two consecutive crops, but good resolution can promote each other. Simply fearing contradictions and using the method of planting one less crop to avoid them is not an attitude that we revolutionaries should adopt. Our task is to grasp and resolve contradictions.
    This year, Lintong County, Shaanxi, planted 200,000 mu more of autumn fields than last year, all planted in wheat stubble fields in the summer. As a result, the area of regular wheat fields has decreased from 350,000 mu to 150,000 mu.
    Can catching stubble wheat achieve a bumper harvest? Unraveling this knot has become an important key to the current increase production and save movement centered on grain in the local area. The comrades of the Lintong County Committee of the Communist Party of China have accurately identified and seized this key. They went deep into the masses, conducted joint investigations with grassroots cadres, technicians, and experienced farmers on the planting and harvesting of catching stubble wheat over the years, studied the relationship between catching stubble wheat and its previous crops, clarified the fact that catching stubble wheat can achieve a bumper harvest, and figured out the secrets to increasing the production of catching stubble wheat. Then, they conducted large-scale publicity, discussion, and promotion in all communes and production teams throughout the county. This not only universally raised the enthusiasm for striving for a greater bumper harvest next summer but also further increased the drive to strengthen the management of autumn fields.
    The secret to increasing the production of catching stubble wheat lies in the word "catch." The experience summarized by the Lintong County Committee and the masses is "ten advances": advance processing of autumn fields; advance transport of sufficient base fertilizer; advance implementation of autumn sowing area; advance protection of soil moisture; advance arrangement of labor and animal power; advance selection of fine seeds; advance inspection of tools; advance preparation of pesticides and machinery; advance repair of canals; advance training of technicians. The first and most important of these is to process autumn fields early to promote early maturity of autumn crops.
    "Better early than late, the earlier the more production increases," the principle is so clear, and the facts are so obvious! Contradiction is the driving force of all things. Only those who dare to face contradictions without avoiding them are good at resolving contradictions and actively promoting the progress of things.

    赶茬
    杨岭
    有些地方的农民把收了秋庄稼以后复种的冬小麦叫做“赶茬麦”。这个“赶”字用在这个地方再恰当也没有了。
    赶茬，不只是上一茬庄稼“赶”下一茬庄稼，而且要反过来，使后一茬庄稼“赶”前一茬庄稼。复种的两茬庄稼互相“赶”，就能最有效地利用土地和时间。
    麦茬地里种了秋，收了秋之后种麦的时间就更紧迫了，这就要求种麦的准备工作做得更早更好。秋种工作能早做的都早做了，既可以减少秋收期间农活“聚圪塔”，又可以在收了秋之后马上耕地种麦。
    秋茬地里要种麦，势必要求秋庄稼早熟快收，这就必须把秋田后期管理工作做得更快更好。秋庄稼能够早熟早收，既能够减少秕粒空壳和避免冻害，又便于冬小麦及时早种。
    上下两茬之间，是有矛盾的，解决得好就能够互相促进。光怕矛盾，用少种一茬的办法来避免矛盾，不是我们革命者应当采取的态度。我们的任务是掌握矛盾解决矛盾。
    陕西临潼县今年比去年多种了二十万亩秋田，都是夏季在麦茬地里种的。这样，正茬麦地的面积就由三十五万亩减少到了十五万亩。
    赶茬麦究竟能不能丰收？解开这个圪塔，成了当地当前开展以粮食为中心的增产节约运动的一个重要关键。中共临潼县委的同志们看准了而且抓紧了这个关键。他们深入群众，同基层干部、技术员和有经验的农民共同调查了赶茬麦历年种植、收获的情况，研究了赶茬麦和它的前茬庄稼的关系，弄明白了赶茬麦能够丰收的事实，摸清楚了赶茬麦增产的门道，然后，在全县各公社各生产队大宣传、大讨论、大推广。这一来，不但普遍提高了争取明年夏季更大丰收的积极性；而且更加提高了加强秋田管理的干劲。
    赶茬麦增产的窍门就在“赶”字上。临潼县委和群众一起总结出来的经验是“十提早”：提早给秋田加工；提早运足底肥；提早落实秋播面积；提早保好地墒；提早安排好劳力畜力；提早选好良种；提早检修工具；提早配好药械；提早修好渠道；提早训练技术人员。其中头一条，也是当前顶要紧的一条，就是早给秋田加工，促进秋田早熟。
    “赶早不赶晚，越赶越增产”，道理是多么敞亮，事实又是多么明显！矛盾是一切事物发展的动力。只有敢于正视矛盾而不回避矛盾的人们，才善于解决矛盾，主动地推动事物前进。
