Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, September 24th: According to the Vietnam News Agency, people in various parts of Lower Laos have recently continued to hold rallies and demonstrations involving thousands of participants to oppose the U.S. imperialism and the reactionary Thai government's interference in Laos' internal affairs, the conspiracy of instigating and supporting the Phoumi Nosavan rebel group to split Laos, and to support the Phouma government's policy of peace, neutrality, and national reconciliation.

For four days, from the 16th to the 19th, more than 5,000 people held demonstrations in the Ankan area of Savannakhet Province, which is currently controlled by the Nosavan rebel group. The marching crowds passed through villages and demonstrated near the heavily guarded Ankan, unanimously shouting slogans against American interventionists, against Thai interference in Laos' internal affairs, and in support of the Phouma government's policy of peace, neutrality, and national reconciliation. Similar rallies and demonstrations have also recently been held in the Dongxing and Buala Pha areas of Savannakhet and Khammouane provinces, as well as in the Huainan and Chala counties.

At many mass rallies held in various places, petitions were passed to the King, the Phouma government, and the coup committee headed by Kong Le, demanding that the Phouma government take a firm attitude towards the Phoumi Nosavan-Wen Weng rebel group.

According to Vientiane Radio, people from all walks of life in Muong Khalla and Phongsaly province in Upper Laos recently established a committee to strive for national reconciliation and peaceful neutrality, opposing the Phoumi Nosavan rebel group supported by the United States and Thailand.

Xinhua News Agency, September 25th: Vientiane News: Lao Prime Minister Phouma revealed on the 24th that the Thai government is supporting the Phoumi Nosavan rebel group in preparing to launch another attack on Vientiane and is preparing a conspiracy to directly interfere in Laos' internal affairs by force.

According to the Associated Press, Phouma told reporters that he had received intelligence indicating that a mixed force composed of Thai troops and Phoumi Nosavan troops was concentrating on the Thai side opposite Vientiane, preparing to launch an offensive against Vientiane. However, Phouma said that the rebel forces were not capable of occupying Vientiane.

In response to the recent clamor by Thai Prime Minister Sarit Thanarat, who openly threatened to use force to interfere in Laos' internal affairs, Phouma said that Sarit's remarks indicated that Thailand was "completely capable" of launching a direct armed attack on Vientiane.

Phouma said that the foreign ministers of the United States, Britain, and France are meeting in New York to "discuss the Lao situation," and it is expected that UN Secretary-General Hammarskjöld will discuss the issue there with Thai Foreign Minister Khoman on the 26th.

Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, September 25th: According to the Associated Press from Bac San, in the Bac San battle on the 22nd, in which the Royal Army defeated the Phoumi Nosavan rebels, the Royal Army seized a large amount of military equipment, including two 120 mm mortars, eight 81 mm mortars and several 60 mm mortars, a machine gun, more than 400 rifles, and a large amount of ammunition and food.

The news said that the ammunition boxes were all marked with American markings and the words "Made in the USA."

It was reported that Captain Kong Le repeatedly refuted the nonsense that there were "Viet Minh" troops supporting the Royal Army in a conversation with two American reporters in Bac San on the 23rd. In the face of irrefutable facts, the Associated Press had to admit that "there were no signs of communists."

　　老挝下寮各地群众示威反对美国泰国干涉内政
　　要求王国政府坚决镇压叛乱
    富马首相指责泰国政府支持老挝叛乱集团准备再次进攻万象
    新华社河内24日电　据越南通讯社报道，老挝下寮各地人民群众最近继续举行成千人参加的集会和游行示威，反对美帝国主义和泰国反动政府干涉老挝内政，唆使和支持富米·诺萨万叛乱集团分裂老挝的阴谋，并且支持富马政府的和平、中立和民族和睦政策。
    自16日至19日的四天里，在目前被诺萨万叛乱集团控制的沙湾拿吉省安坎地区，有五千多人举行游行示威。游行队伍穿过各个村庄并在布置有岗哨的安坎附近示威，他们一致高呼反对美国干涉者，反对泰国干涉老挝内政和支持富马政府的和平、中立和民族和睦政策的口号。最近在沙湾拿吉和甘蒙省的东兴和布阿拉法地区，以及会南和恰拉县，也举行了同样的集会和示威。
    在各地举行的许多群众集会上，都通过了致国王、富马政府和以贡勒为首的政变委员会的请愿书，要求富马政府对富米·诺萨万—文翁叛乱集团采取坚决的态度。
    据万象电台报道，在上寮丰沙里省的木恰拉和丰海县各界人士最近成立了争取民族和睦和和平中立委员会，反对在美国和泰国支持下的富米·诺萨万叛乱集团。
    新华社25日讯　万象消息：老挝政府首相富马24日揭露泰国政府支持富米·诺萨万叛乱集团准备再次向万象发动进攻，并且准备直接以武力干涉老挝内政的阴谋活动。
    据美联社报道，富马向新闻记者说，他接到的情报表明，有一支由泰国军队和富米·诺萨万军队组成的混合部队正在万象对岸的泰国一边集中，准备向万象发动攻势。但是，富马说，叛乱部队没有能力占领万象。
    富马在答复关于最近泰国总理乃沙立接连发表的公然要用武力干涉老挝内政的叫嚣时说，乃沙立这些谈话表明泰国“完全可能”直接用武力对万象发动进攻。
    富马说，美、英、法三国外交部长正在纽约会晤“讨论老挝局势”，预料联合国秘书长哈马舍尔德将在26日同泰国外长科曼在那里讨论这个问题。
    新华社河内25日电　据美联社自北汕报道，在22日击溃富米·诺萨万叛军的北汕战役中，王国军队曾缴获了许多军事装备，包括两门120毫米的迫击炮，八门81毫米迫击炮和几门60毫米的迫击炮，一挺机枪，四百多支步枪和许多弹药和粮食。
    这则消息说，弹药箱上都有美国标记，并且有美国制字样。
    据报道，贡勒大尉23日在北汕对两名美国记者的谈话中，一再驳斥有所谓“越盟”军队支持王国军队的胡说。在铁的事实面前美联社也只得承认“没有任何共产党的迹象”。
