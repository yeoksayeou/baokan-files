    The Redness of the Yi Guihua Family	Story by Liu Zongtang, Illustration by Zhao Zhifang
    After the Party Central Committee issued the call to launch a production increase and conservation campaign, it was relayed to the Fourth Production Team of the Jiaotong Brigade of the Yinshan Commune in Zizhong County, Sichuan Province. The Yi Guihua family held a meeting overnight, and the whole family competed to set production increase plans. The exemplary actions of this family caused a sensation in the entire team, and soon a high tide of learning from and catching up with the Yi Guihua family was formed...
    The Fourth Production Team of the Jiaotong Brigade of the Yinshan People's Commune in Zizhong County, Sichuan Province, enthusiastically launched the "Learn from Yi Guihua, Catch up with Yi Guihua" movement. Every family strived to work full days, and everyone strived for high work efficiency to ensure the realization of the newly formulated production increase plan.
    Yi Guihua is an old model worker and member representative of the Fourth Production Team, and has consistently taken the lead in labor. Recently, he was greatly encouraged by studying and discussing the Party's call for increasing production and practicing economy, and he is determined to put in even greater effort to engage in production. On the evening of August 21, after the entire team formulated a production increase plan, Yi Guihua held a family meeting overnight, and the whole family put forward three guarantees: First, work full attendance every day. Two rated laborers and three non-rated laborers guarantee to work every day except for holidays; second, everyone exceeds the quota. Yi Guihua should do 47 workdays per month, the eldest son Yi Dafu 40 per month, the three non-rated laborers 12 per month for the older ones and 7 for the younger ones; third, obey the leadership of the captain, lead the masses, take on difficult tasks, and give way to easier tasks.
    The next day, as soon as dawn broke, Yi Guihua turned over and got out of bed, shouting loudly, "It's dawn, get up quickly and go to work." The whole family responded and got up quickly, washed their faces hastily, and went uphill to work with their farm tools. The team stipulated that breakfast should be eaten at dawn, and work should begin after breakfast, but on this day, when it was dawn and time for breakfast, the Yi Guihua family had already done some work. Yi Guihua was responsible for plowing the soil with an ox. When the weather became hot at noon, he could no longer plow. According to the usual practice, the person using the ox should also rest, but Yi Guihua believed that "seizing the time is like seizing gold." Regardless of rest, he put down the plow and picked up a hoe to help the team break the soil and plant carrots. After lunch, he was the first to go uphill to plant carrots, and when the sun was setting in the afternoon, Yi Guihua used the ox to plow the soil again. By dinner time, he had overfulfilled the entire day's work quota. But he was not satisfied with this. After resting a little after dinner, he took advantage of the bright starlight and cool weather to change the plowing cattle to the field again, and plowed until the remaining part of the land he had plowed that day was finished before returning home. Yi Guihua's eldest son, Yi Dafu, was responsible for harvesting middle-season rice that day. He and three other team members formed a shock team and competed with another threshing machine team. When his hands were sore, he wrapped them in cloth and continued threshing. With one burst of energy, they finally surpassed the other team. The four of them threshed more than 2,500 catties of grain a day, about double what they had done in the past. Yi Guihua's two daughters and one son, who were studying in elementary school, weeded and turned the vines of one and a half mu of sweet potato land. In the evening, everyone returned home and talked about it, all overfulfilling the tasks assigned by the team, doing the work of one and a half days in one day. After Yi Guihua encouraged his children, he urged everyone to wash their feet and go to bed quickly to get a good rest so that they could work harder tomorrow.
    The exemplary actions of the Yi Guihua family caused a sensation in the entire team. The team committee decided to use him as a pacesetter to call on all team members to learn from Yi Guihua. Every family in the team held family meetings to formulate work attendance plans. Fathers encouraged their sons, brothers encouraged their brothers, and husbands and wives encouraged each other. Everyone enthusiastically went to work, and everyone considered it an honor to work more. Yi Guihua’s neighbor, Yi Guirong, actively learned from the old model worker. These days, when the Yi Guihua family went to work early in the morning, the Yi Guirong family also followed suit immediately. Yi Guirong’s daughter, Yi Daying, had just been transferred from the brigade to support front-line production. Initially, she still had some ideological problems, but under the influence of the whole family, she immediately corrected her erroneous views, took off her shoes and went into the fields, and worked with the members to weed and fertilize the late rice. Li Binwen's family of eight had only two sons, Li Kaimo and his wife, who were not active in working. This time, the whole family formulated a work attendance plan and carried out criticism and self-criticism with each other. The whole family gave them opinions, saying, "First bitterness, then sweetness, happiness for ten thousand years," "You only want to eat good things, but you don't love to work, how can that be?" After the education and help of the captain and the whole family, Li Kaimo and his wife actively went to work, and have broken their quotas for several consecutive days. The Fourth Production Team has a total of 127 people, with 48 rated laborers who should work 42. Since the launch of the "Learn from Yi Guihua" movement, in addition to the 42 rated laborers who should be working all working, the number of non-rated laborers working has also greatly increased, and the total number of people working often remains above 80.
    Due to the large number of team members working and the high work efficiency, the various production increase measures originally formulated by the team have been completed ahead of schedule: First, harvesting. The original plan was to harvest 14 mu of middle-season rice and 36 mu of beans in seven days, but the results were harvested in just over five days, and achieved careful harvesting and full grain storage; second, management. The original plan was to treat the late rice for pests again, weed it once, and top-dress it once in ten days, and to weed, lift vines, and fertilize the sweet potatoes once each, and to weed, thin seedlings, and fertilize the two mu of autumn corn, four mu of autumn sweet potatoes, and fifteen mu of radishes that have been planted. As a result, the above work was completed on time and with quality in just over seven days; third, planting. The team planned to plant an additional 20 mu of red and white radishes before the end of August, but the results were overfulfilled two days ahead of schedule, with an additional two mu planted.

    易贵华一家红	刘宗棠文　赵志方插画
    党中央提出开展增产节约运动的号召传达到四川资中县银山公社交通大队第四生产队后，易贵华一家人连夜召开了会议，全家人争订增产计划；这一家人的模范行动，轰动了全队，很快就形成了一个学、赶易贵华一家人的高潮……。
    四川资中县银山人民公社交通大队第四生产队热烈开展了“学易贵华、赶易贵华”运动，家家争取出满工、人人争取高工效，确保实现新制订的增产计划。
    易贵华是第四生产队的老模范、社员代表，劳动一贯积极带头。最近，他在学习和讨论党的增产节约号召中，受到很大鼓舞，决心拿出更大的干劲来搞生产。8月21日晚上，全队订出了增产计划后，易贵华连夜召开了家庭会议，全家人提出三项保证：一、天天出全勤。两个评级劳力和三个级外劳力，除例假外保证每天出工；二、人人超定额。易贵华每月要做劳动日四十七个，大儿子易大富每月四十个，三个级外劳力大的每月十二个，小的做七个；三、服从队长领导带动社员群众，见难做的活路就上，遇好做的活路就让。
    第二天，东方刚露鱼肚白，易贵华就翻身起床，高声喊道：“天亮了，赶快起床出工了。”一家人应声而起，匆匆洗好脸就拿起农具上坡干活去了。队上规定天亮吃早饭，吃过早饭出工，但这天等到天亮开饭时，易贵华一家人已干了一歇活路。易贵华负责使牛犁土，犁到中午天气炎热时就不能耕作，使牛的人照例也要休息，但易贵华认为“抢时如抢金”，顾不得休息，放下犁头，就扛起锄头帮助队上碎土种红萝卜。中午吃过饭后，他又是第一个上坡种萝卜的人，干到下午太阳偏西时，易贵华又使牛犁土，吃晚饭时他已超额完成了全天应做的活路。但是他并不因此而满足，晚饭后稍稍休息了一下，就趁着皎洁的星光、凉爽的天气，又换了耕牛到地里去了，一直把这天翻犁的那块土地剩下的一部分犁完才转回家去。易贵华的大儿子易大富这天负责收打中稻，他和其他三个队员组成一个突击小组，和另一个拌桶竞赛，手打痛了用布包起打，一鼓作气终于超过了对方，四个人一天打谷二千五百多斤，比过去提高一倍左右。易贵华在小学读书的两个女娃娃和一个男娃，给一亩五分红薯地除了草、翻了藤。晚上，大家回到家里一交谈，全部超额完成了队上交下的任务，一天做的活路要顶过去一天半。易贵华勉励了儿女一番后，就催促大家赶快洗脚睡觉，好好休息，明天更要使劲干。
    易贵华一家人的模范行动，轰动了全队，队委会决定以他为标兵，号召全体队员向易贵华学习。全队家家召开家庭会制定了出工计划，父勉其子，兄勉其弟，夫妻互相鼓励，人人踊跃出工，人人以多出工为荣。和易贵华同院住的易贵荣，积极向老模范看齐，这几天当易贵华全家一早出工时，易贵荣的一家也马上跟着行动。易贵荣的女儿易大英是刚从大队抽调转来支援第一线生产的，最初她还有点思想问题，但在全家人的带动下，立即纠正了自己的错误看法，脱鞋下田，和社员一道给晚稻薅秧、施肥。社员李斌文一家八口人，只有二儿李开模夫妻两个出工不积极，这次全家订出了出工计划，相互开展了批评与自我批评，一家老少给他们提意见说：“先苦后甜、幸福万年”，“你们光想吃好的，又不爱劳动，那咋行？”李开模夫妻经过队长和全家人的教育帮助，积极出工，最近连续几天都突破了定额。第四生产队共有一百二十七人，评级劳力四十八个，应出工四十二个，自开展“学习易贵华”的运动后，除四十二个应出工的评级劳力全部出工外，级外劳力出工数也大大增加，出工总人数经常保持在八十人以上。
    由于队员出工多、工效高，全队原订的各项增产措施都已提前完成：一、收。原订计划在七天内收完十四亩中稻、三十六亩豆类，结果在五天多时间即已收完，并做到精打细收、颗粒还仓；二、管。原计划在十天内给晚稻再治虫一次、薅草一次、追肥一次，给红薯除草、提藤、施肥各一次，给已种的二亩秋玉米、四亩秋红薯、十五亩萝卜除草、匀苗、施肥，结果以上工作只用了七天多就按质按量完成了；三、种。全队计划在8月底前增种红白萝卜二十亩，结果提前两天超额完成，多种了两亩。
