    Trees and Forests

    Will going deep into grassroots units, deep into the forefront of production, weaken the leadership of overall work? The answer is no. This not only does not weaken it, but strengthens the leadership of overall work.
    Understanding a forest begins with understanding its trees; understanding all the sparrows in the world begins with dissecting one or a few sparrows. Understanding one or a few canteens means understanding many canteens under roughly the same conditions; understanding one or a few production teams means understanding many production teams under roughly the same conditions; understanding one or a few workshops means understanding many workshops under roughly the same conditions. ...
    There is a well-said passage in the "Examining the Present" chapter of the *Lüshi Chunqiu*: "A wise person values understanding the distant from the near, knowing the ancient from the present, and understanding the unseen from what is seen. Therefore, by observing the shadow under the hall, one knows the movement of the sun and moon, and the changes of yin and yang; by seeing ice in a bottle of water, one knows the coldness of the world, and the hiding places of fish and turtles. By tasting a small piece of meat, one knows the flavor of a pot of stew, and the seasoning of a cauldron."
    Seeing the "whole" from the "part," seeing the "surface" from the "point," deeply understanding the "point" precisely deepens the understanding of the "surface." Because the commonality resides within the individuality.
    When the situation is clearly understood, the measures proposed based on the situation are practical measures; the methods proposed based on the situation are effective methods. These measures and methods are applicable to improving one or a few canteens, and also applicable to many canteens under roughly the same conditions; they are applicable to improving the work of one or a few production teams, and also applicable to many production teams under roughly the same conditions; they are applicable to improving the production of one or a few workshops, and also applicable to many workshops under roughly the same conditions. ...
    Such examples are countless in our production, our life, and our study, they are very many, very many!
    Song Yaxin, the First Secretary of the Danyang County Committee of Jiangsu Province, took up short-term residence in the Dabai Commune. On the issue of rationally arranging labor, he dissected two sparrows—the Pengrong Brigade and the Dagong Brigade. From the comparison of the good and bad experiences of the two brigades, Song Yaxin proposed a set of specific measures for rationally arranging labor, and also proposed the commune Party committee's "30/70 split" (spending 70% of the time on agriculture, and 30% of the time on departmental work) working method. The experience in this regard is not only applicable to the Dabai Commune, but is also being promoted throughout the county. The new coal mining method centered on hydraulic transportation is a major innovation in the coal mining industry. This innovation originated in the third coal mining section of the Fifth Pit of the Ping'an Mine in Fuxin City, and was later promoted to 80% of the working faces of the Ping'an Mine, greatly promoting the leap forward in production.
    Of course, our investigation and research, and our summarization of experience, are guided by the universal truth of Marxism-Leninism, and this is fundamentally different from narrow empiricism.
    Seeing the universal significance and development trend from the sprouts of socialism and communism; acquiring concrete experience from individual personnel and individual events in individual units, and then providing universal guidance to all units. Chairman Mao's brilliant Marxist-Leninist leadership method will always be our model for learning.
    From the determination of three poor peasant households, Chairman Mao pointed out the path and direction that 500 million peasants across the country should take; from the vivid image of Wang Guofan running the cooperative diligently and frugally, Chairman Mao saw the image of the entire country; from the example of the Yingju Cooperative in Henan, Chairman Mao saw the revolutionary spirit and revolutionary demeanor of the people of the whole country, full of vigor and high morale.
    If one delves into a point without consciously understanding the situation and summarizing experience, but only for the sake of delving deeply, then this will indeed weaken the leadership of overall work. This will not only weaken the leadership of overall work, but it will also not help improve the work of the "point" in the first place.
    If one delves into a point, and although one understands the situation and gains experience, but treats this experience like a good arrow, rubbing it in one's hands and exclaiming, "What a good arrow! What a good arrow!" but is unwilling to let it go, unwilling to apply and promote it on the "surface," then good experiences and good methods can only remain at the "point."
    The relationship between trees and forests, between the individual and the general, between the point and the surface, has both differences and unity, and is also capable of being unified. Go deep into the grassroots, deep into the forefront of production, and thereby strengthen the leadership of the general through typical examples!

    树木与森林

    深入基层单位，深入生产的最前线，会削弱对全面工作的领导吗？答曰，非也。这不但不是削弱，而且正是加强了对全面工作的领导。
    了解森林，始于了解树木；了解天下麻雀，始于解剖一个或几个麻雀。了解了一个或几个食堂，也就是了解了在条件大体相同下的许多食堂；了解了一个或几个生产队，也就是了解了在条件大体相同下的许多生产队；了解了一个或几个车间，也就是了解了在条件大体相同下的许多车间。……
    《吕氏春秋》察今篇中有一段话说得好：“有道之士，贵以近知远，以今知古，以益所见知所不见。故审堂下之阴，而知日月之行，阴阳之变；见瓶水之冰，而知天下之寒，鱼鳖之藏也。尝一脬肉，而知一镬之味，一鼎之调。”
    从“局部”看到“全体”，从“点”看到“面”，深入地了解了“点”，正是加深了对“面”的了解。因为共性寓于个性之中。
    情况摸清楚了，那么，根据情况所提出的措施是切实的措施；根据情况所提出的办法是有效的办法。这措施，这办法对改善一个或几个食堂适用，对在条件大体相同下的许多食堂同时适用；对改进一个或几个生产队的工作适用，对在条件大体相同下的许多生产队同时适用；对改进一个或几个车间的生产适用，对在条件大体相同下的许多车间同时适用。……
    这样的例子，在我们的生产中、生活中、学习中，车载斗量，比比皆是，那是多得很、多得很的！
    江苏省丹阳县委会第一书记宋亚欣同志在大泊公社短期落户。他在合理安排劳动力的问题上，解剖了两只麻雀——彭埩大队和大贡大队。宋亚欣从两个大队好坏经验对比中，提出了一套合理安排劳动力的具体措施，又提出了公社党委“三七开”（以70％的时间抓农业，以30％的时间抓部门工作）的工作方法。这方面的经验，不仅大泊公社适用，而且正向全县推广。以水力运输为中心的新采煤法，是煤矿工业中的一项重大革新。这项革新发源于阜新市平安矿五坑第三采煤段，后来在平安矿80％的工作面获得推广，大大地促进了生产的跃进。
    当然，我们的调查研究、总结经验，以马克思列宁主义的普遍真理作为指导，那是与狭隘经验主义有原则性的差别的。
    从社会主义、共产主义新事物的萌芽中看到它的普遍意义和发展趋势；从个别单位的个别人员，个别事件取得具体经验，从而向一切单位作普遍的指导。毛主席的光辉灿烂的马克思列宁主义的领导方法，永远是我们学习的典范。
    毛主席从三户贫农的决心中，指出了全国五亿农民所要走的道路和方向；毛主席从王国藩勤俭办社的生动形象中看到了整个国家的形象；毛主席从河南应举社的实例中看到了全国人民意气风发、斗志昂扬的革命精神和革命风貌。
    如果深入到一点去，不有意识地去了解情况，总结经验，而是为了深入而深入，那么，确实会削弱对全面工作的领导的。这不但对全面工作的领导会削弱，而且首先对改进“点”的工作，也不会有什么帮助。
    如果深入到一点去，虽然了解了情况，取得了经验，但是，把这经验当作一枚好箭，在手里搓来搓去，口称“好箭呀！好箭呀！”就是不愿放出去，不愿在“面”上运用和推广，那么，好经验、好办法也就只能停在“点”上。
    树木与森林之间，个别与一般之间，点与面之间，既有差异，又有统一，也是能够统一的。深入基层，深入生产的最前线，从而通过典型，加强对一般的领导吧！
