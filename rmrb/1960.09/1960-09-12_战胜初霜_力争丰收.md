Currently, autumn crops have entered a crucial stage that will determine the harvest. Ensuring that autumn crops overcome various natural disasters, especially the sudden attack of early frost, and striving for a high-yield and abundant harvest of autumn crops is a major matter that requires special attention at this time.

The climate in spring and summer this year was somewhat abnormal. Natural disasters such as drought, flood, wind, hail, and insects occurred alternately in some areas, which had some impact on the sowing and growth of autumn crops. Some crops were delayed in sowing due to spring drought, and encountered prolonged rain during the growth and development period, so the harvest period may be slightly longer than in previous years. However, according to the predictions of the meteorological departments, the first frost this year may arrive a few days earlier than in previous years in most areas. This further increases the arduousness of field management in the later autumn season.

Grasping frost prevention is an important task in striving for more harvest in the autumn. The main measures for frost prevention are: before the frost, take various measures to promote early maturity of crops to avoid frost attacks; when frost occurs, overcome the invasion of frost to extend the growth and development period of crops. At present, we must start from the following aspects:

According to the situation in previous years, the areas in China that need to prevent frost are the Northeast, northern North China, and parts of Northwest China. The growing season of crops in these areas is relatively short, and the time of the first frost varies greatly, so the harm of frost is extremely serious. However, in these areas, the habit of frost prevention has not yet been universally developed, and it is necessary to fully mobilize the masses to generally recognize its importance. In other areas, because the date of frost appearance is generally later, the frost intensity is weaker, and crops in most areas enter the mature stage during the frost period, the harm of the first frost is generally lighter. Therefore, ideological麻痹 can easily lead to relaxation of due vigilance against frost. This is a very harmful idea. China has a vast territory and a complex and changeable climate. Almost every year in early autumn or late spring, some areas will experience frost, which sometimes causes disasters, reducing or even losing the harvest of crops. Therefore, preventing the harm of early frost is one of the important tasks of field management in the late autumn season. It is related to the issue of increased production and harvest of grain crops this autumn, and must be given due attention. In our struggle against nature, we should not have a fluke mentality. No matter which region, we should "plan for the worst and strive for the best," so that we are prepared for any eventuality. In fact, some areas in the South may also be suddenly attacked by low temperatures and frost damage. If we do a good job in frost forecasting and prevention, frost can be overcome. As long as the temperature between plants is slightly increased by artificial methods, the harm of frost to crops can be greatly reduced or even avoided. In early September 1959, leaders at all levels in Zhangye Special District, Gansu Province, personally took charge and extensively mobilized the masses to adopt methods such as large-scale smoke fumigation to prevent frost, overcoming the harm of the first frost, so that more than 1.14 million mu of crops such as cotton, buckwheat, and millet in the district avoided frost damage and achieved a bumper harvest. This fact vividly tells us that if frost prevention is done well, more grain and cotton can be taken back from nature.

Frost prevention is a mass activity in the struggle against nature. In frost prevention areas, it is necessary to establish frost prevention organizations at all levels under the unified leadership of the Party, with special personnel responsible for frost intelligence, communication, material transportation, publicity and mobilization, and other work. It is necessary to set up defenses at all levels and implement the work to the production team. It is necessary to assign people, land, measures, and responsibilities, unified command, unified action, and cast a net to closely monitor the occurrence and development of frost, and not let frost take advantage of any loopholes. Strict organization, close cooperation, and coordinated operations, maximizing the use of manpower and material resources, is an important link in improving the effectiveness of frost prevention. In the spring of this year, in the defense against late frost, Shanxi, Henan and other provinces established frost prevention headquarters at all levels under the unified leadership of the local Party committees, absorbing agriculture, meteorology, post and telecommunications, commerce, culture and education and other departments to participate. The headquarters set up frost prevention offices in key areas for frost prevention, went deep into reality, went deep into the fields, specifically arranged and inspected frost prevention work, so that the organizational work was done in a thorough and meticulous manner, and overcame the sudden attack of frost. This is a very good experience and worthy of emulation.

In addition, it is also necessary to strengthen forecasting work and formulate an overall frost prevention plan based on the growth and development characteristics of local major crops. It is necessary to classify, rank, and grasp key points based on different terrains, areas where frost has been most likely to occur in previous years, and the lowest indicators of various crops that can tolerate low temperatures, combined with the overall plan for autumn harvest and autumn sowing. Determine which crops and which areas need major prevention, which only need minor prevention, and which can be prevented without prevention. It is necessary to analyze specifically, treat differently, in order to save manpower and material resources. Meteorological departments at all levels, especially the meteorological哨组 of the People's Commune, should go deep into production and deep into the fields before frost, conduct detailed investigations, analyze the situation, find out the laws, and do a solid job of frost forecasting.

In recent years, we have accumulated rich experience in fighting against frost. Seriously summarizing these experiences in terms of organization and technical methods is of great significance for overcoming this year's frost. Generally speaking, the commonly used methods for large-scale frost prevention are mainly smoke fumigation and irrigation. Smoke fumigation and irrigation can generally increase the temperature by one to two degrees. As long as the forecast is accurate and the defense is timely, frost can be overcome. Last year, Henan and other provinces created a kind of frost prevention炮 in mass frost prevention activities. This kind of炮 has the advantages of wide range of materials, low cost, simple production, good effect, and easy promotion. Henan has been widely promoted, and other provinces can also follow suit.

Summarizing experience is the starting point of frost prevention work. In order to maximize the effectiveness of these experiences in actual work, it is necessary to quickly impart frost prevention knowledge and methods to the masses through various means. When imparting experience and technical methods, it is necessary to pay attention to the characteristics of autumn crops. The methods of preventing late frost cannot be mechanically applied to the prevention of early frost. When using certain toxic frost prevention smoke screen materials, special attention should be paid to the specific objects of the crops. If too much chemical reagents such as sulfur are used, the sweet potato vines can be infected with toxins, and livestock are prone to poisoning when eaten, so attention should be paid to the amount used.

The season waits for no one. All localities must seize the current valuable opportunity, actively arrange and do all the preparation work for frost prevention, overcome the sudden attack of frost, and strive to harvest more and more in autumn!

    战胜初霜　力争丰收
    当前，大秋作物已进入决定收成的紧要关头。力保秋收作物战胜各种自然灾害特别是初霜的突然袭击，争取大秋作物高产多收，是目前时期特别需要注意的一件大事。
    今年春夏两季气候有些反常，某些地区的旱、涝、风、雹、虫等自然灾害交错发生，对大秋作物的播种和生长发育有所影响。某些作物因春旱推迟了播种，而在生长发育期间，又遇到了久雨，因而收获期比往年可能稍为拉长。但根据气象部门的预测预报，今年的初霜冻大部地区比往年可能提早几天。这样就更增加了秋季后期田间管理的艰巨性。
    抓紧防霜冻是争取秋季多收的一项重要任务。防霜冻的措施主要是：在霜前，采取各种措施，促进作物早熟，以躲过霜冻的袭击；在霜冻发生时，战胜霜冻的侵袭，以延长作物的生长发育期。目前要从以下几方面着手：
    根据历年的情况看来，我国防霜冻的地区是东北、华北北部和西北部分地区，这些地区的农作物的生长期比较短，初霜出现的时间变化较大，因而霜冻的危害极为严重。但是在这些地区，防霜的习惯也还没有普遍养成，必须充分动员，使群众普遍认识其重要意义。在其他地区，由于霜冻出现日期一般较晚，霜冻强度较差，降霜时期作物大部进入成熟阶段，初霜冻的危害一般较轻。因而思想麻痹容易放松对霜冻应有的警惕。这是一种十分有害的思想。我国地域辽阔，气候复杂多变，几乎在每年的早秋或晚春总会有些地区发生霜冻，有时并会造成灾害，使农作物减产甚至失收。因此，预防早霜冻的为害，是秋季后期田间管理的重要任务之一。它关系着今年秋季粮食作物的多产和多收问题，必须引起应有的注意。我们在向大自然作斗争中，不应当存有侥幸心理，无论哪一地区，都应“从最坏处打算，向最好处努力”，做到有备无患。事实上，在南方的某些地区也有可能遭到低温和冻害的突然袭击。如果我们做好霜冻的预报和预防工作，霜冻是可以战胜的。只要用人工的方法稍为提高植株间的温度，就可以大大减弱以至避免霜冻对作物的危害。1959年9月初，甘肃张掖专区各级领导亲自挂帅，广泛发动群众，采取大面积熏烟防霜等办法，战胜了初霜的为害，使全区一百一十四万余亩棉花、荞麦、糜谷等作物避免了冻害，获得了丰收。这个事实生动地告诉了我们，防御初霜做得好，是可以向大自然夺回更多的粮棉的。
    防霜是向大自然作斗争的群众性活动。在防霜地区必须在党的统一领导下，层层建立防霜组织，专人负责防霜情报、通讯联系、物资运输、宣传鼓动等工作。要层层设防，把工作落实到生产队，要定人、定地、定措施、定责任，统一指挥、统一行动，撒下一个天罗地网，严密注视霜冻的发生和发展，不让霜冻钻了空子。严密组织，密切配合，协同作战，最大限度地利用人力和物力，是提高防霜效果的重要一环。今年春季在防御晚霜当中，山西、河南等省在当地党委的统一领导下，层层设立了防霜指挥部，吸收农业、气象、邮电、商业、文教等部门参加，指挥部在防霜的重点地区设防霜办公室，深入实际，深入田间，具体布置检查防霜工作，使组织工作做得深入细致，战胜了霜冻的突然袭击。这是一个很好的经验，值得仿行。
    此外，还必须加强预报工作，根据当地主要作物生长发育的特点，制订出整体的防霜方案。要根据不同的地形、历年霜冻最容易发生的地区以及各种作物所能忍受低温的最低指标，结合秋收秋播的总体计划，分类排队，掌握重点，确定哪几种作物、哪几块地区需要大防，哪些只需小防，哪些可以不防。要具体分析，分别对待，以节省人力物力。各级气象部门特别是人民公社的气象哨组，应在霜冻前，深入生产，深入田间，进行细致的调查，分析情况，摸清规律，扎扎实实地把霜冻预报工作做好。
    几年来，在和霜冻作斗争中，我们积累了丰富的经验。认真地从组织上和技术方法上总结这些经验，对战胜今年的霜冻有十分重要的意义。一般来说，大面积防霜，常用的方法主要是熏烟和灌水两种。熏烟和灌水一般能增温一至两度，只要预报准确，防御及时，霜冻是可以战胜的。去年，河南等省在群众性的防霜活动中，创造出一种防霜炮，这种炮具有取材广泛、成本低廉、制作简单、效果良好、易于推行的优点，河南已经普遍推广，其他各省亦可仿行。
    总结经验是防霜工作的起点。要使这些经验在实际工作中发挥最大效用，必须通过各种方式，迅速地把防霜的知识和方法，传授给广大群众。在传授经验和技术方法的时候，必须注意大秋作物的特点。防御晚霜的方法不能硬搬到防御早霜时使用。使用某些带有毒性的防霜烟幕材料时，就应特别注意作物的具体对象。如硫磺等化学药剂用量过多，能使红薯蔓感染毒素，牲畜吃了容易中毒，所以应该十分注意用量。
    节令不等人。各地必须抓紧当前宝贵时机，积极安排和做好防霜冻的一切准备工作，战胜霜冻突然袭击，力争秋季收得多些、更多些！
