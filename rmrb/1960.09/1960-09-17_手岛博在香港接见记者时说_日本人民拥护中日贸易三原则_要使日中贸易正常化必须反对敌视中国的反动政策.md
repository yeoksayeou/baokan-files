Xinhua News Agency, Hong Kong, September 16th. Hiroshi Teshima, head of the Japan Socialist Party Policy Deliberation Council delegation to China, said in Hong Kong on the 15th that Premier Zhou Enlai's three principles of Sino-Japanese trade are very reasonable, and the Japanese people will warmly support them.

The delegation led by Hiroshi Teshima visited China for fifty days and only passed through Hong Kong on the 15th on its way back to Japan. He told Hong Kong newspaper reporters that the obstacle to the normal development of Sino-Japanese trade is the Ikeda government's continued implementation of reactionary policies hostile to China and its pursuit of the American conspiracy to create "two Chinas."

Teshima believes that Ikeda is a representative of Japanese monopoly capital and is closely colluding with U.S. imperialism. He said that in order to strive for the normalization of Sino-Japanese trade, the Japanese people must continue to wage a resolute struggle against the Ikeda government.

    手岛博在香港接见记者时说
    日本人民拥护中日贸易三原则
    要使日中贸易正常化必须反对敌视中国的反动政策
    新华社香港16日电　日本社会党政策审议会访华代表团团长手岛博15日在香港说，周恩来总理提出的中日贸易三原则非常合理，日本人民一定会热烈拥护和支持。
    手岛博率领的代表团曾在我国访问了五十天，15日才路过香港回日本。他对香港的报纸记者说，日中贸易正常发展的障碍，是池田政府继续执行敌视中国的反动政策，以及追随美国制造“两个中国”的阴谋。
    手岛博认为，池田是日本垄断资本的代表，又与美帝国主义勾结得很紧。他说，要争取日中贸易的正常化，日本人民必须同池田政府继续进行坚决的斗争。
