Xinhua News Agency, September 5th, Tokyo Dispatch: The Japanese Communist Party issued a statement on the 4th, pointing out that the cancellation of the Dutch aircraft carrier's "visit" to Japan was another heavy blow to the conspiracy of the imperialists headed by the United States. It also called on the Japanese people to fight to drive away the U.S. Seventh Fleet and dismantle U.S. military bases in Japan.

The statement from the Presidium of the Central Committee of the Japanese Communist Party said: As everyone knows, the purpose of the Netherlands and U.S. imperialists in dispatching the "Karel Doorman" to West Irian was to threaten the peace and independence of Indonesia. This is part of the U.S. imperialists' aggressive plan to establish a nuclear system in the Far East and Southeast Asia.

The statement called on the Japanese people to further strengthen their struggle to remove the U.S. Seventh Fleet vessels from Japanese ports and abolish U.S. military bases in Japan.

Xinhua News Agency, September 4th, Tokyo Dispatch: Yoshitaro Hirano, Chairman of the Japan Peace Committee, and Koshiro Okakura, Standing Director of the Japan-Asia-Africa Solidarity Committee, issued statements today, unanimously pointing out that the forced cancellation of the Dutch warship's "visit" to Japan was a victory for the joint struggle of the Japanese and Indonesian people.

Hirano said that the Japanese people have struggled to urge the Japanese government to cancel its permission for the Dutch fleet to visit Japan, so it can be said that they have lived up to the expectations of the Indonesian people who support the Japanese people's struggle against the Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty, which is gratifying.

He pointed out that the measures taken by the Ikeda government are out of the ambition to seek economic expansion of Japanese monopoly capital into Southeast Asia.

Hirano pointed out that the Japanese people must redouble their efforts to launch a struggle to win Japan's national independence and defend peace.

Okakura Koshiro said that the Japanese government's move was taken in the face of strong protests from the Indonesian people and government and the struggle of the Japanese people. Okakura emphasized that Japanese diplomacy must be based on the Bandung spirit. He said that for the Japanese people, the most important thing is to strengthen friendship and solidarity with the people of Asia, Africa and Latin America.

At the same time, several major bourgeois newspapers in Tokyo also believe that this is a diplomatic failure for the Ikeda Cabinet.

The "Yomiuri Shimbun" said that the Ikeda government was afraid that the deterioration of diplomatic relations between Japan and Indonesia would affect Japan's "economic cooperation" and trade relations with Indonesia; and it was also afraid that it would be detrimental to the Liberal Democratic Party in the upcoming general election. The newspaper also said that the strong opposition struggle launched by the Japanese people was the reason for the government's cancellation of permission for the Dutch warship to visit Japan.

    日共就荷兰航空母舰被迫取消访日发表声明
    号召人民赶走美国舰队撤除美军基地
    平野义太郎等说荷舰取消访日是日本和印度尼西亚人民共同斗争的胜利
    新华社5日讯　东京消息：日本共产党4日发表声明，指出取消荷兰航空母舰对日本的“访问”，是对以美国为首的帝国主义者的阴谋的另一次沉重打击。并且号召日本人民为赶走美国第七舰队和撤除美军在日本的基地而斗争。
    日本共产党中央委员会干部会的声明说：大家都知道，荷兰和美帝国主义者把“卡雷耳·杜尔曼号”派遣到西伊里安去的目的是威胁印度尼西亚的和平与独立。这是美帝国主义者在远东和东南亚建立核体系的侵略计划的一部分。
    声明要求日本人民为使美国第七舰队的舰艇从日本的港口撤出去、撤销美国在日本的军事基地而进一步加强他们的斗争。
    新华社4日讯　东京消息：日本和平委员会理事长平野义太郎和日本亚非团结委员会常任理事冈仓古志郎今天发表谈话，一致指出荷兰军舰被迫取消“访问”日本这件事是日本和印度尼西亚人民共同斗争的胜利。
    平野说，日本人民为促使日本政府取消准许荷兰舰队访日而进行了斗争，这样可以说没有辜负支持日本人民反对日美军事同盟条约斗争的印度尼西亚人民的期望，这是值得欢欣的。
    他指出，池田政府现在所采取的措施，是出自谋求日本垄断资本向东南亚洲进行经济扩张的野心。
    平野指出，日本人民今后必须加倍努力展开斗争，为争取日本的民族独立和保卫和平而奋斗。
    冈仓古志郎说，日本政府的这一措施，是在印度尼西亚人民和政府的强烈抗议以及日本人民的斗争的情况下采取的。冈仓强调指出，日本的外交必须以万隆精神为基础。他说，对于日本人民来说，最重要的是加强同亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲各国人民的友好和团结。
    同时东京资产阶级几家大报也认为这是池田内阁外交上的一次失败。
      “读卖新闻”说，池田政府害怕日本同印度尼西亚的外交关系恶化会影响到日本同印度尼西亚的“经济合作”和贸易关系；并且害怕在即将举行的大选中对自由民主党不利。这家报纸又说：日本人民展开的强烈的反对斗争，是政府取消准许荷兰军舰访日的原因。
