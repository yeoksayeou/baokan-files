　　In the Past, Only the Sounds of Cattle and Sheep Were Heard; Today, the Fragrance of Grain Fills the Air
　　Xilingol Grassland Achieves Grain Self-Sufficiency
　　(Our dispatch) Thanks to the vigorous efforts of the broad masses of herdsmen and farmers under the leadership of the Party to develop agriculture, the Xilingol Grassland in Inner Mongolia, which for thousands of years "only heard the sounds of cattle and sheep, but not the fragrance of grain," has this year achieved self-sufficiency in grain and fodder.
　　This year, the pastoral areas of the Xilingol League planted 1.63 million mu of grain, fodder, oil crops, and other economic crops. These crops have now matured. At present, state-run agricultural and pastoral farms and commune-run farms are rushing to harvest the autumn crops. To ensure a bumper harvest, the broad masses of herdsmen, workers, cadres, military personnel, teachers and students, and urban residents have actively devoted themselves to the first large-scale autumn harvest on the grassland. Many settlements and yurts have appeared in the fields. The grasslands, which were empty in the spring, are now piled with wheat stacks. More than 164,000 mu of spring wheat have been harvested, and most other crops have also yielded a good harvest. From now on, the Xilingol Grassland has ended its history of relying on agricultural areas for long-distance supply of grain and fodder.
　　The pastoral area of the Xilingol League is located in the central part of Inner Mongolia, with more than 190,000 square kilometers of natural pasture. The water and grass are abundant, and the soil is fertile. It is not only a good place to develop animal husbandry, but also suitable for developing agriculture. However, in the past, not a single grain of food was produced here, and the herdsmen were solely engaged in animal husbandry. After liberation, the state supplied this pastoral area with tens of millions of catties of grain every year, and a large number of trucks and more than 10,000 ox carts transported grain from hundreds of miles away every year. From 1956, with the development of the mutual aid and cooperation movement in animal husbandry, some mutual aid teams, cooperatives, and state-run farms, responding to the call of the Xilingol League Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, tried to run agriculture on the grassland and cultivated grain and fodder crops on small areas. After the Great Leap Forward and the people's communes in 1958, the communes and state-run farms attached greater importance to agricultural production. By last year, the sown area of ​​grain and fodder in the entire pastoral area reached 290,000 mu, and most of the harvests were very good. After the autumn harvest, in addition to obtaining a portion of food supply locally, the herdsmen also provided some fodder for livestock, which promoted the continued leap forward in animal husbandry in 1960.
　　This spring, in accordance with the Party Central Committee's idea of ​​taking agriculture as the foundation and the instructions of the Inner Mongolia Party Committee, the Xilingol League Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, on the basis of four years of trial agriculture in the pastoral areas, widely mobilized the masses and launched a mass campaign to vigorously develop agriculture on the grassland. In one spring, the entire league built nine new state-run farms, and the people's communes in the pastoral area generally established commune-run farms. Each production brigade organized agricultural professional teams to open up large areas of grain and fodder bases. In addition, the league, banner, organs, enterprises, schools, and troops have also established grain and vegetable bases.
　　At the beginning of the vigorous development of agriculture, the people's communes, under the premise of unified arrangements for animal husbandry and agriculture, mobilized more than 30,000 herdsmen to invest in the reclamation and sowing movement with more than 10,000 oxen and strong horses. Mongolian herdsmen who newly participated in agricultural production did not understand agricultural technology, and farmers from the south did not know how to train "raw" cattle and horses, so they launched mutual teaching and mutual learning and cooperated with each other. At the same time, the league and banner agricultural departments also trained more than 2,600 herdsmen and more than 360 Party branch secretaries, enabling them to master preliminary agricultural technology and knowledge of leading agriculture.
　　There was an urgent need for seeds during spring sowing. More than 2,000 young and middle-aged herdsmen from West Ujimqin and Abaga Banner voluntarily formed a "Iron Cavalry Transport Team." Each person brought two horses and traveled day and night to carry 400,000 catties of seeds back from the agricultural area 300 miles away. When agricultural tools were insufficient, the league and banner iron and wood machinery factories, commune iron and woodworking groups, and farmers and herdsmen refined iron to cast plows and went up the mountains to cut wood to make plowshares themselves. Industrial, commercial, health, and other departments in the towns were mobilized to support agriculture, and neighboring agricultural areas also provided strong support in terms of manpower and materials, ensuring the successful completion of the reclamation and sowing tasks.
　　The vigorous development of agriculture in the pastoral area has brought about new developments in the combination of agriculture and animal husbandry, and has caused a series of changes on the grassland. The development of agriculture in the pastoral area has first laid the foundation for the stable, comprehensive, and high-speed development of animal husbandry. After this year's autumn harvest, in addition to retaining enough seeds for next year and food for more than 100,000 people, the pastoral areas of the entire league will be able to take out a large part of the grain as feed, and there are also a large amount of crop stalks that can be used as forage, ensuring that the weak livestock and young livestock can safely survive the winter and spring.
　　After the vigorous development of agriculture, more than 120 new settlements have emerged on the grassland. Each settlement has houses, and sideline businesses such as pig farming and vegetable growing have also developed. Mongolian herdsmen and Han farmers work together, live together, learn from each other, and help each other in the vigorous development of agriculture, bringing national unity into a new stage of development.

　　过去只听牛羊叫　今天又闻五谷香
　　锡林郭勒草原粮食自给自足
    本报讯　千百年来“只听牛羊叫，不闻五谷香”的内蒙古锡林郭勒草原，今年由于广大牧民和农民在党的领导下，发愤图强，大办农业，已经做到了粮食饲料自给自足。
    今年，锡林郭勒盟牧区种植了一百六十三万亩粮食、饲料、油料和其他经济作物。这些作物现在已经成熟。目前，各国营农牧场、社办农场，正在突击秋收。为了保证丰产丰收，广大牧民、工人、干部、部队官兵、学校师生、城镇居民，都积极地投入了草原上第一次大规模的秋收工作。田间地头出现许多居民点和蒙古包。春天还是空旷的草地上，现在堆起了麦垛。十六万四千多亩春小麦已收割完毕，其他作物也大部获得了丰收。从此，锡林郭勒草原结束了依靠农业区远途供应粮食、饲料的历史。
    锡林郭勒盟牧区地处内蒙古的中部，有十九万多平方公里的天然牧场，水草丰美，土壤肥沃，不仅是发展畜牧业的好地方，而且适宜于发展农业。但是，从前这里不产一粒粮食，牧民单纯经营畜牧业。解放后，国家每年供应这个牧区数千万斤粮食，年年有大批汽车和一万多辆牛车从千百里外运粮。从1956年开始，随着畜牧业互助合作运动的发展，部分互助组、合作社和国营牧场，响应中共锡林郭勒盟委员会的号召，在草原上试办农业，小面积地开荒播种粮食饲料。1958年大跃进和人民公社化以后，各公社和国营牧场，更加重视了农业生产。到去年，全牧区粮食饲料播种面积达到二十九万亩，大部分收成很好。秋收后，牧民们除了就地得到一部分口粮供应外，还给牲畜提供了一些饲料，促进了1960年度畜牧业继续跃进。
    今年春天，中共锡林郭勒盟委员会根据党中央提出的以农业为基础的思想和内蒙古党委的指示，在牧区四年试办农业的基础上，广泛发动群众，在草原上掀起了一个全民性的大办农业的高潮。一个春季，全盟新建了九个国营农场，牧区各人民公社普遍建立了社办农场，每个生产大队都组织农业专业队，大片开辟粮食饲料基地。此外，盟、旗各机关、企业、学校、部队，也都建立了粮食蔬菜基地。
    在大办农业的开始，各人民公社就在统一安排牧业和农业的前提下，动员了三万多名牧民，带着一万多头犍牛壮马投入了开荒播种运动。新参加农业生产的蒙古族牧民不懂农业技术，南来的农民不会调教“生个子”牛马，他们就展开互教互学，互相合作。同时，盟、旗农业部门还培训了二千六百多名牧民和三百六十多名党支部书记，使他们掌握了初步的农业技术和领导农业的知识。
    春播时急需种子，西乌珠穆沁和阿巴嘎旗的二千多名青壮年牧民，自愿组成“铁骑运输队”，每人带两匹马，日夜兼程，从三百里外的农业区驮回了四十万斤种子。农具不足，盟、旗各铁木机械等工厂、公社铁木工组和农牧民，就自己炼铁铸铧，上山伐木制犁杖。城镇中的工业、商业、卫生等部门，都动员起来支援农业，邻近农业区也在人力、物力等方面给予了大力支援，保证了开荒播种任务胜利完成。
    牧区大办农业，使农牧结合有了新的发展，引起了草原上一系列的变化。牧区农业的发展，首先为稳定、全面、高速度地发展畜牧业打下了基础。今年秋收过后，全盟牧区除留足明年的种子和十多万人的口粮以外，还能拿出很大一部分粮食作饲料，另外还有大量的作物秸秆可作饲草，使瘦弱牲畜和幼畜安全过冬度春有了保证。
    大办农业后，草原上新出现了一百二十多个新居民点，每个居民点都有了房屋，养猪种菜等副业也有了发展。蒙古族牧民和汉族农民，在大办农业中，共同劳动，共同生活，互相学习，互相帮助，使民族团结进入了一个新的发展阶段。
