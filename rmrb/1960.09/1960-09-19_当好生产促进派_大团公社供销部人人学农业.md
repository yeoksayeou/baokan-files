Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 18th: The salespersons of the Datuan People's Commune Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Nanhui County, Shanghai, have been actively studying agriculture and have excellently served as promoters of agricultural production.

The Supply and Marketing Cooperative specifically established a team, led by the Party Branch Secretary, to guide the salespersons' studies. With the production materials department as the core, and guided by the principle of "learning while working," they mainly studied in three aspects:

First, learning from farmers and learning from labor. They visit villages to do business and take the opportunity to work in the fields with commune members, asking questions as they work. When commune members come to buy things, they also discuss production. Some salespersons have established mentor-apprentice relationships with elderly farmers, seeking advice from them. When the Supply and Marketing Cooperative organizes salespersons to learn about production material commodities, experienced farmers are invited to introduce their experiences.

Second, combining individual self-study with mutual teaching and learning. The salespersons in the Supply and Marketing Cooperative's production materials department have one hour of self-study time each day, reading dozens of books on soil, chemical fertilizers, pest control, crop yield increase, and the performance of agricultural machinery. They also connect with production and purchasing and sales operations, carrying out mass research activities, and have written more than 1,700 study心得 [personal reflections] this year. The salespersons also widely carry out mutual teaching and learning, establishing mutual aid groups to provide mutual guidance and exchange experiences.

Third, continuous practice and continuous investigation and research. The Supply and Marketing Cooperative adopted the "three-way combination" approach of salespersons, commune members, and scientific research personnel, establishing 31 rice and cotton experimental fields and 689 mu of insect-free experimental fields, recording data daily and analyzing it regularly. Through labor practice, they study the growth patterns of various crops, the effectiveness of fertilizers and pesticides, and the characteristics of pest growth and reproduction.

Through continuous learning and research, the salespersons of the Datuan Supply and Marketing Cooperative have become relatively familiar with agriculture, thus being able to adapt to the needs of production at various times and proactively and promptly supply production materials. Based on the agricultural activities of the twenty-four solar terms of the year, the salespersons have arranged a work schedule for each solar term, created a "Work Guidance Calendar," and established an "Agricultural Handbook" for each production team, recording the team's labor force, crop area, and inventory of production materials at any time, so as to prepare and arrange early. This year, in order to plant more autumn vegetables, the commune started sowing early rice and applying base fertilizer in mid-April. The salespersons knew that the most suitable base fertilizer for the local soil was a combination of phosphate, nitrogen, and potassium fertilizers. They opened the "Agricultural Handbook," calculated how much each production team needed, and clearly knew the quantities. In late March, they organized delivery teams to send superphosphate and ammonium sulfate.

    当好生产促进派
    大团公社供销部人人学农业
    据新华社上海18日电　上海市南汇县大团人民公社供销部的营业员们积极钻研农业，出色地做了农业生产的促进派。
    供销部专门成立了一个小组，由党支部书记当组长，领导营业员学习。他们以生产资料部门为主，在贯彻“一边工作一边学习”的原则下，主要从三方面进行学习：
    第一，向农民学，从劳动中学。平时串乡做买卖，有空就下田和社员一起劳动，边干边问；逢到社员上门买东西，也谈谈生产。有的营业员与老年农民建立了师徒关系，向老农请教。供销部在组织营业员学习生产资料商品知识时，邀请有经验的农民介绍使用的经验。
    第二，个人自学与互教互学相结合。供销部生产资料部门的营业员，每天有一小时自学时间，阅读土壤、化学肥料、虫害防治、农作物增产、农业机具性能等方面的几十种书籍。他们还联系生产和购销业务，开展群众性的研究活动，今年来已经写出一千七百多篇学习心得。营业员们又广泛开展互教互学，建立互助组，互相辅导，交流经验。
    第三，不断实践，不断调查研究。供销部采取营业员、公社社员和科学研究人员“三结合”的方式，建立了三十一块稻、棉试验田和六百八十九亩无虫试验田，天天记录，定期分析。通过劳动实践，研究各种农作物的生长规律，肥料、农药的效用，以及病虫害生长、繁殖的特点。
    通过不断学习和钻研，大团供销部的营业员比较熟悉农业了，从而能够适应各个时期生产上的需要，主动及时地供应生产资料。营业员根据一年二十四个节气的农事活动，排定每个节气的工作日程，订出一份“工作指导历”，又按生产队建立“农业手册”，随时把队里的劳动力、作物面积和生产资料库存情况记录下来，做到早准备早安排。今年公社为了多种一熟秋菜，提前播种早稻，四月中旬就施基肥。营业员们懂得最适宜于当地土壤的基肥是磷肥、氮肥、钾肥合用，打开“农业手册”一算，每个生产队需要多少，一清二楚，三月下旬就组织送货队送去了过磷酸钙和硫酸铵。
